<h3>半年來戰局總檢討（續昨）</h3>
<p>（六）東北戰局　東北林彪匪的企圖，是在想把長春潘陽這兩個富有政酪，戰略意義的地區拿去，打算實現毛匪澤東，李匪立三的亞洲共產國際情報局，和成立偽傀儡組織的迷夢。但是國軍據守這兩個戰略據點，不特牽制住匪的五十萬精銳，不能自由活動，而且等於擺了兩個定時炸彈，使國際野心家　躇徘徊，除了擴大共匪這枝國際第五縱除的內亂外，總不敢學日本帝國者的魯莽，就立刻把東北一口呑下去。他們勉强掙扎，由去年冬季直到現在，也只有在熱遼邊區作流寇式的滋擾，而在這個區域裏的廣大人民，就是毛澤東匪首所說的——「解放軍」的基礎，却反而大批成干成萬的携幼扶老，跋涉千里，投奔到祖國懷抱裏來。到目前爲止，單是到了平津區的，已超過百多萬人民，其不能進關者想逃出來的人，何止千萬。目前在東北的數十萬國軍，始終屹立不動，匪亦無可奈何，這個事實，就證明匪軍事基礎的動搖，國軍戰略，政略的成功。</p>
<p>（七）華北戰局　華北戰塲，由匪首毛澤東，朱德直接指揮下的聶榮臻，李運日，賀龍，徐向前等匪部，半年來處心積慮，妄想破壤平綏，平古，平保及北寗路，津浦段等幾條交通要這，使華北的政治經濟，陷於麻痺狀態，而便於匪軍的流竄竊踞。可是匪每次蠢動，都受到我軍的機動的打擊。從今年一月在平保綫的失敗，以及三月後滋擾平綏路又受挫而回，五月的竄犯承德，被我內外夾擊而敗退，接着騷擾平古路，其第三縱隊竟被我在平谷附近地區殲滅近半；六月聶榮臻，李運昌諸匪，聯合竄擾秦皇島外圍，打算破壞津榆段鐵路，但在安山，石門，昌黎等地，被我擊斃者達五千餘人，我鐵路交通，由於國軍掩護路工奮勇搶修，通車情形，今極良好，事實證明聶匪在華北妄想破壞我交通的陰謀是被粉碎了。然而最有意義的勝利，還不在此，而是國軍在此交通綫以外地而的控制和對聶匪軍力的打擊。在晋北地區，冀東地區，熱遼邊區，冀察地區的各次戰役，證明匪的「佔面」「斷綫」的政策，已開始失敗，尤以戰力的損耗，更出聶匪的意外。</p>
<p>（八）西北戰局　西北方面，彭匪自去年冬季受挫，今春三攻榆林失敗，經毛匪補充後，改路南竄，最初偷襲宜川，雖得逞一時，旋因國軍採取機動戰略，放棄失去戰略價值的據點後，彭德懷匪部約四個縱隊的主力，孤軍深入，被吸引在涇渭津谷中，消滅達三分之二。自五月初，隴東大捷，爲西北陝甘等省奠定了穩固的基礎，彭匪各縱隊殘部，只好退而潛伏在黃龍山區休息整補，而且迄今仍在我軍搜索掃蕩中，匪想在西北擴大流竄的迷夢終不得逞。</p>
<p>（九）華中戰局　華中戰塲從大別山區的掃蕩戰成功，把劉伯誠匪建立南進根據地的計劃粉碎，只好狼狽投奔到伏牛山·桐柏山和陳賡合股。中問又會合陳擬，孔從周兩匪，一度在南陽外國蠢動，並向宛西民團進攻。但是除了佔踞西峽口的山區外，在南陽外圍匪部被國軍消滅者達二萬餘人。最近豫東會戰，陳毅，劉伯承及土共金紹山，魏鳳樓等二十萬匪衆，集中全力，在黃泛區反攻，結果在九天的血戰中，傷亡超過八萬多，而我僅一師一旅，蒙受損失。匪在逃竄途中，被我陸空聯合追剿，傷亡亦甚重大，在魯西黃河邊上，我軍奪獲匪之武器，可編一個旅。陳匪今年的失敗，雖沒有去年在山東的慘重，但也不能即刻恢復其原有戰力。匪爲掩飾失敗，曾偷襲襄樊，徼倖得逞，但現在又爲國軍所光復了。</p>
<p>（十）華東戰局　華東方面陳毅在蘇北殘留了第二，十一，十二等三個縱隊，自六月初，在鹽阜地區，蒙受重創後，一度曾圖竄回魯南，惟遭國軍在阿湖，新安一帶堵戳，逃回魯南者，僅十一縱隊所屬千餘人。近雖在漣水，沭陽，宿遷附近企岡蠢動，但自從蘇北實行總體戰後，人民和政府部隊漸打成一片，到處都是剿匪的力量，匪之目的，在想多方牽制，分散我兵力，然而我人民自衛武力，若日益强大，匪欲分散國軍兵力，就不容易。至於魯中方面，匪雖以第七，第八，第九，第十三等四個縱隊兵力，先蠢動于昌黎，濰縣，近又攻陷了兗州，目前正在整補休息，謠傳將於最近進攻濟南，如果戰局會發展到這一步，該方面匪將難逃我內外夾擊的命運。</p>
<p>（十一）戰果比較半年來由于國軍戰略的改變，對于殲滅匪軍主力，已有很大的成就，雖在地域方面，我收復軍要城鎭六十五處，自動放棄與匪侵陷的，則有八十九處，好像匪有若干進展；但最近之豫東大捷，即爲我集中兵力機動使用的最佳收獲，對子國際第五縱隊在中國的「有生力量」，巳予慘重的打擊。至於匪我傷亡的比較，上半年約爲我一匪三之比，總計匪軍傷亡爲七十一萬零五百七十二人（七月初黃泛區大戰傷亡數尚不在內），而我軍傷亡則僅廿三萬二千八百五十一人；在同一時期內，俘匪四萬四千六百八十人，我失踪官兵爲五萬二千零七十一名。又一至五月份（六月份尚在統計中）我軍戰果，計鹵獲匪軍步機槍三萬三千二百六十三枝，輕機槍八百一十二挺，重機槍一百廿六挺，手提機槍一百八十四挺，手槍七百五十五枝，山野砲一十七門，手榴彈五萬一千一百五十三枝，各種砲彈四千二百八十八發，各種步槍彈四十八萬九千二百五十八發。儘管匪天天發出誇大的虛偽的宣傳數字，爲潛伏在國軍區域內的第五縱隊地下份子打氣，然而全中國的人民眼睛是亮的，他們迫切的在向政府要求加强戡亂的力量。中國人民過去能打退日本的侵略，當然更有決心和毅力打垮比日本更凶惡的新興帝國主義的第五縱隊共匪。（完）</p>

<h3>恢復政府信用為第！　—新經濟措施的先決條件—</h3>
<p>所謂「新經濟措施方案」或「經濟改革方案」，日來傳說紛紜，忽而說就要公佈，忽而說可能暫緩，至其內容則更言人人殊。最近廣束省主席宋子文氏應召由穗飛京，備總統關於此項方案的諮詢，昨天下午翁院長等正在京會商，可見無論此方案之內容如何，有無新頴之處，大槪總有這一回事了。</p>
<p>老實說來，近來的經濟情况，的確要使現內閣的翁院長大傷腦筋的。因爲政府一方面大鈔出籠，增加發行，一方面拋售物資，收縮銀根，原想多少扯勻，以免刺激物價。但，物資拋售出去就不能收回，法幣回籠以後却還是要出來流通；銀根鬆濫，物價固然是漲，銀根抽緊，物價稍停仍漲。以致由五月底而至七月底，兩月之問，美匯官價增了九·三倍，躉售物價增了六·二倍，生活指數增了四·五倍，開了新紀錄！大家看不過去，便責望於現內閣，行政當局自己也看不過去，便不得不有所謂「新經濟措施方案」的擬訂。</p>
<p>這一新經濟政策的傳說，雖已甚囂塵上，內容却還未分曉。我們當然不願見此後的經濟情形比現在更形嚴重，也不願對現內閣的未來政策妄肆批評，更不願想像新的政策不能挽救危機，但衡以歷次的經濟改革情形，我們覺得政府當局如果還眞能反省，稍稍懂得爲政之道，則在侈談一切經濟改革之前，在犬胆嘗試任何經濟措施新花樣之前，不能不先想一想政府的信用問題。政府假如還以爲信用沒有什麼重要，那麼今後任何改革儘管動機好，用意好，儘管改革幣制也許是當前的需要，而在人民不信任之前提下，仍恐將陷於一着之錯全盤皆非的局面，我們爲國家大局着想，的確，不敢不說幾句老實話了。</p>
<p>信用兩個字，很難造就而極容易失却的，失却了以後又是更不容易恢復的；個人如此，家庭如此，團體如此，政府也何嘗不是如此？我們舊事重提，實在替政府不勝惋惜！抗戰以前，政府頗能維持債信，雖在九一八事變的時候，政府對於公債有减半信息延期還本的「非常」舉措，但人民激於敵愾同仇，大家並不反對而樂於接受；此後幸無背信事情發生，纔把國民政府的信用始終維持着，因此廢兩改元和法幣政策得以推行無阻。抗戰軍事發動，五億元的愛國公債就不待宣傳而銷售一空。我們應該坦白承認：這是抗戰的經濟基礎建築於政府信用上面的實證。嗣後政府在重慶又發行了好多次的公債，好多次的儲蓄券，其中且有美金公債和黃金儲蓄券，尤爲人民所樂於承受。可惜那時的行政當局宋院長不知道受了那一些小心眼見的斂財專家之慫恿，也變成了「近視」，抄了九一八時候减半付息的老文章，把美金公債以法定匯率還本付息，把到期的黃金儲蓄券扣去四成的獻金。在當時，也許獻策者以爲靈機一動，政府可以少一筆支出，省一筆黃金，殊不知信用一失，到今天還受着影響。那些獻策的斂財家瞧該愧悔萬分吧！</p>
<p>中國人向來講求樂善好施的，捐了些錢還不要緊，何况當國家危急之秋？不過他們吃了一次虧，學了一個乖，以後政府要向人民募債，無論說得如何天花亂墜，人民就給政府一個不理不睬了。</p>
<p>勝利以後，政府明知公債不能再隨便發行了，乃傾其全力於拋售黃金與外匯，以爲軍事在半載一年之中可以順利結束，只須在此期間穩住物價卽得，當然未始不是一種看法。可惜政府的軍事未能如期結束、估計錯誤，於是不及一年差不多黃金售去大半，外滙也幾乎拋光。這倒不是政策之錯而是估計之誤。政府在售黃金拋外匯兩件事上，確沒有像從前扣去捐獻黃金四成的失信用，然而還不能完全恢復人民對於政府的信任。</p>
<p>到了內閣改組，張院長上台，大家認爲理財專家的張公權氏又復寄望於發行公債了。市上最吃香的旣是美金，於是就有美金公債與美金庫券的駢肩發行；發行之前，中央銀行的總裁副總裁照例要有一番談話，對於債信的維持，似乎誠懇萬分，人民也想政府或不致再度失信，雖還存着觀望態度，禁不得外滙牌價的一再調整，公債和庫券似乎有利可圖，政府似乎還能堅守諾言，也就再度被歆動了。可是久而久之，官市外滙牌價就釘住不動了，而同時期的黑市外滙却在飛漲，人民乃又在躭心債券的本息怎樣着落了。政府適於其時，爲着吸收僑滙，鼓勵輸出與節省國庫對於美金公債和庫券還本付息的數字兼籌並顧起見，便發明了一種結匯證明書。公債和庫券持有人說他不對吧，債券上明明寫着按照外匯平準委員會的掛牌還本付息，掛牌不動，何得額外要求？技術之妙，可嘆觀止，但在人民看起來，政府在債券上或將不免又失一次信用！</p>
<p>我們要正告翁院長的：政府收縮通貨，莫妙於增加正當的稅收，和發行公債，而這兩項却都有賴於政府主管人員的信用。其他如拋售物資和停止貸放都不是收縮通貨最有效的辦法，不必說理由，只要看一年來的事實便可明白。政府除了整頓稅收而外，惟有發行公債是吸收市上游資最正當的道路。人民在有利條件之下，對於有信用政府的公債證券無不樂於承買，中國如此，外國也是如此，過去如此，將來還是如此。可惜政府大員，往往受看打小算盤的人巧言如簧的迷惑，患着近視毛病，不知不覺間把政府在人民前面的信用喪失了，遂使發行公債後難爲繼。而且加以不識大體的自命經擠管制機構的官員胥吏，偏要把一個饅劵市塲搞到風聲鶴唳，好使人民對證券的購買裏足不前，這更不但是貪小失大，簡直是想關閉發行公債之門而自絕生路了。</p>
<p>行憲政府的成立，照中國的老話，本來是痛切「罪已」，「與民更始」，恢復政府信用的絕好機會了。可惜的是大員們雖都讀破了萬卷書，却似乎忘了「民無信不立」的老話，爲了彌補赤字，就想不顧憲法上人民生命財產應獲得保障的規定，另外來些別出心裁的新花樣，而還不肯老老實實趕快做一二件恢復政府大信的事情出來，從根救起，我們恐怕會有一天闖下更大的禍，但深願吾言之不中。</p>
<p>我們也深知道，最高當局關切國家財政經濟情勢之嚴重，勤求博詢，希望政府能有一新耳目的措施，挽救垂臨的危機。不要說政府負責長官，就是平常老百姓，也都在各自研討，想作愚者千慮一得的貢獻。然而最根本的先決問題，我們仍以爲恢復政府信用是第一步。若是沒有顧到信用，任是裁併銀錢業，或令行莊停業若于時日，黃金收歸國有，檢查倉庫乃至硬開保管箱等等新花樣，都是行不通而徒失民心的障碍物。如想用這些手法來作改革幣制的準備，那更是天大的笑話！而且，在信用沒有恢復以前，濫改貨幣的單位究有何用？我們敢大膽說一句：政府有了信用，就可以發行公債；政府有了信用，就可以立刻停止增發通貨；政府有了信用，就可以開闢財源，彌補國家預算的赤字：政府有了信用，就可以得到人民的充分擁護，早日戡平匪亂。一切的一切，先從恢復信用着手，切莫視爲老生常談！以中國人力之衆，士地之廣，蘊藏之富，友邦之助，政府有了信用，何難走到自力更生之路？政府果眞有意走此坦蕩蕩的大道，而不去隨便濫走蹊徑魔道否，我們將於其今後舉措卜之。</p>
<h3>黃工總局長陳泮嶺談　今年黃汛最緊張　希望各方協助此難關</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封八日電〕黃河修防工程每屆大汛最爲嚴重。記者爲明瞭本年防汛情形，特訪黃河工程總局長陳泮嶺氏，據說：黃汛雖年年緊張，但從未如今年之甚。（一）去年河水初歸故道，流勢緩，致河底淤塞。今年永位增高。（二）根據過去經驗，今年河水應較去年爲大。去年最大流量未超過一萬五千秒立方公尺。（三）今年防汛條件遠不及去歲，蓋因（甲）自豫境曲興集迄魯西董莊段堤防脆弱，且自去冬因匪擾，迄未能施工。（乙）此次匪陷開封，本局及冀豫兩省修防處料物工具，損失殆盡。沿河自豫境楊橋險工以下，至魯省董莊險工以上，所有各段隊料物器材，亦被搶掠一空。（丙）本年防汛費，本局根據三月份物價預算爲三千億，依據目前情形至少須增加十倍以上。况本局及各修防處損失一空，更需鉅款補充。截至今日止，中央僅陸續撥到修防費五百億，不足甚鉅。（丁）月來大汛已屆，搶修工作迭受匪阻撓。六月十五日魯西戰事轉緊，員工被迫後撤，中途被俘職員十八人，工伕二百卅二人。他處亦屢有傷亡。總之本年汛期巳屆，河水逐漸加大，流量已達六千餘秒立方公尺，希望各方賜予通力協助，以冀渡此難關。</p>

<h3>延長多瑙河公約建議　蘇堅決表反對　英提請國際仲裁遭否決</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒七日電〕多瑙河會議今日以七票對三票，否決英國所提出請海牙國際法庭或聯合國秘書處仲裁一九二一年之多瑙河公約應否延長之建議。表決時英美法投贊成票，東歐各國投反對票。在辯論中美代表凱農力言美國之草案，較蘇聯之草案更能保障多瑙河航行之自由。英國請求海牙或聯合國仲裁之建議提出後，美法代表極力予以支特，法代表且謂如大會拒絕仲裁，法國即拒絕接受大會之決議。蘇聯代表維辛斯基則力言並無任何法理問題需要仲裁，渠根本拒絕考慮一九二一年之公約，並强調「一九四六年之四强會議，已將充分之權力賦予目前之多瑙河會議擬訂新公約，其資格為無可懷疑者」。大會中又以七票對三票否決法國所提會議向記者公開之建議，然通過各國代表團可自由向記者報導會議進展之情形。</p>
<h3>四強解決德國問題　將繼續進行會談　西德人民深懼成為「慕尼黑第二」</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦七日電〕消息靈通方面稱：西方三强專使刻在莫斯科與蘇聯進行之談話，如果獲致同意，則此後雙方所將進行之事務約略如下：（一）柏林爭案由駐德盟國總司令就地協商解決；（二）九月間與聯合國大會同時在巴黎舉行四强外長會議；（三）此一會議將澈底籌備，俾免如前之釀成僵局；（四）此間人士認成功之機會，有賴於自始所作之讓步，不若有賴於雙方願獲致同意之甚。</p>
<p>同一方面預料西方三强與蘇聯無一願於該會議舉行之前攤出任何王脾，例如即使恢復柏林原有狀態，三强仍不許蘇聯參加魯爾之管制。同樣蘇聯不致允許西方三强查視蘇聯佔區。雖對德問題之總協定一時頗難商成，但此問消息靈通方面指出，即較小各點能在相互好意之氣氛中獲致協議，亦可恢復相互之信任，此實為克服目前困難所必要者。</p>
<p>〔中央社柏林七日電〕英國准許發行之德電訊報於本日社論中，提出警告稱，今日莫斯科會議，將成為「慕尼黑會議第二」。社論中稱，目前在莫斯科所進行之會議，極使吾人恐其成為慕尼黑會議之續，但此種現象必須避免，蓋循是則德國問題永難解決。蘇聯在柏林雖略佔僵勢，但西方盟國在其以各地所佔優勢之多，對蘇讓步如事先不愼加考慮，則西方盟國之地位將由是一蹶不振。</p>
<h3>美商務週刊撰文　估計蘇實力</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日電〕美商務週刊撰文，估計蘇聯經濟及軍事力量，其結論為第三次世界大戰時蘇聯之經濟影響，為「使蘇聯鉅萬人民又復　野蠻及饑餓之生活。」該雄誌認為另一戰爭使蘇聯人民蒙受之犧牲，將非一般美國人民所可想像。以下之統計乃略舉數例：（一）住屋問題蘇聯於第二次大戰時，其西部房屋被德國破壞者達二千五百萬所，但其營造業仍遲遲不能發展，其原因為工廠及辦公廳有優先獲得建築材料之糧，即蘇聯工業界人員之家屬亦不能於公寫中謀得一大房間</p>
<p>（二）消費品生產低落，按蘇聯若干連績性五年計劃，俱係集中力量擴充車工業，其消費品工業乃大受影響。在第二次大戰結束時，蘇聯重工業已近戰前水準，但蘇聯人民之生活標準，則較廿年前低落，故渠等對再作一次戰爭，甚感恐懼。凡此種種俱可證明蘇聯之首一目的，為建立戰爭工業，使其足與美國相埒而不顧人民因此所遭受之損失。如第三次世界大戰發生，則蘇聯將竭其控制下之歐亞兩洲人力物力，供其重工業之需。在卅年以來，毫未猶疑使千百萬農民啼　號寒而從事農業改革之蘇聯領袖，如認為對其戰爭勝利有所助益時，當仍毫不猶豫　歐洲及其國內千百萬人民於　饉而不顧。故該週刊稱，吾人對未來情况已可預言，此即歐洲及蘇聯人民無疑將進入一新恐怖之黑暗時代。</p>
<h3>通過三法案後　美國會休會</h3>
<p>對杜魯門提案大部拒絕</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕闕會特別會議對性質溫和之制止通貨膨賬法案，及修正之房屋問題措施完成行動後，已於本日休會。此特別會議係杜魯門總統于民主黨全國代表大會中宣佈召開，以對其十八鐘緊急立法計劃採取行動。但國會完全通過之建議，僅有一端，即撥款六千五百萬美元貸借聯合國興建總部之法案是也。共和黨參議員擊敗民主黨在彼等之法案中，並入杜魯門之制止通貨膨脹建議中管制物價及工資諸點之舉動。該法案中，關於提高聯邦準備銀行之準備金，亦遭衆院否決。參院亦更改提高銀行準備金之百分比。為求國會迅速休會，衆院對參院之修改，已予通過。國會所通過之有限度制止通貨膨脹，恢復戰時關於分期付款購買之規條，並規定銀行活期存款之準備金，提高百分之四，定期存款之準備金，提高百分之一·五。衆院亦通過參院所批准之房屋法案，但其中並無杜魯門總統所敦促興建低價公共住屋，及掃除貧民區兩端。此法案已與制止通貨膨脹法案，同送往白宮，以備總統簽字。國會除通過上述三法案外，並撥款彌補聯邦房屋管理局，及退伍軍人管理局，所不足之款項。共和黨議員大都藐視杜魯門，對其建議，幾全部拒絕。唯亦有甚多議員，欲國會對高昂物價及房屋問題，採取更有效之行動。杜魯門雖可再度召開國會，但渠是否作此一舉，極成問題。杜魯門此次已向國會提出其緊急計劃，故將對國會加緊攻擊，以進行其競選運動。民主黨全國委員會主席麥格拉克謂，共和黨控制下之國會，在特別會議中，旣未通過一制止通貨膨脹之有效計劃，則美國人民十一月問可選舉杜魯門，並選出民主黨所領導之國會，即不致再受物價上漲之威脅。</p>
<h3>法財政計劃　國會開始辯論</h3>
<p>財委會已予以修正通過</p>
<p>〔中央社巴鑿七日電〕法財政部長萊諾頃向國民議會稱，自目前至今年年底以及明年國家總預算，將虧細數十億法郎。萊氏此言，咸認為係對議會所提出之一副苦劑法各政治幽體對萊氏所提出之財政計劃，曾澈夜予以審查。社會黨在為法國覓取自由之藉口下，可能接受此項計劃，因此項計劃將可阻止戴高樂派東山再起，若干人民共和黨黨員將拒絕與其同黨份子投票贊成此項計劃。共黨份子對此項計劃，反對尤為激烈，衆信議仰將於本日午後開始辯論。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕法國民議會財政委員會今日通過財長萊諾所要求賦予特殊權力之財政經濟案之許多條款，惟曾加以重大之修正。委員會拒絕予政府以修改捐稅負擔與定率之權力。萊諾準備接受委員會所欲對辭句之變更，因如請作信任表決或保留原文之一切要質，則將危及政府之存在也。同時左翼各團已加入昨日共產黨之抗議，指萊諾之計劃為反憲法。</p>
<h3>西柏林煤氣電力　供應量再減</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林七日電〕英美法佔領軍司令七日下令將柏林西區之煤氣與電力供應，再减低百分之五十，此可使柏林每日供煤氣所用之煤斤减至一千三百噸。家常烹飪所需之電力將减低一半，家用煤氣每日下午九時起至明晨五時止完全停止，此項限制較戰時水準尤嚴，但柏林居民所受痛苦尙不止此蘇聯方面傀儡行政人員承認蘇聯佔領區內食物供應每况愈下，本週初所引以為憂之糧食暴動，顯已受遏制，但僅在蘇聯將若干糧車開至主要出事地點之後，柏林蘇佔區內德官員告柏林報界稱，在糧食配給證能全部生效前，尙需五六星期之久。同時為綏和柏林市內兩種幣訓之紊亂情形起見，西方國家準備空運二千五百萬西　馬克至柏林，並將先　工廠各雇員之新津一百馬克，因各　已欠書兩週。</p>
<h3>義總工會分裂</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬七日電〕義大利共黨七日指斥强有力之天主敎行動組織支持反共工會之脫離全國勞工聯合會，而傳播排除異敎之宗敎。左翼份子所控制之勞工聯合會六日晚正式將所有基督敎民主黨之工會領袖盡行革職，而分裂勞工組職為親共與反共兩集團。共黨機關報「友尼泰」社評。指斥天主敎行動組織「傳播傾軋與混亂」，旨在加强敎會之勢力及其在階級中之組織。該文係由杜尼尼署名，杜氏曾任駐彼大使，曾於三月間未得許可，擅自離職返義從事共黨競選遝動，因此被政府革職。</p>
<h3>賴依向聯大提出　聯合國預算</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日電〕聯合國秘書長賴依，本日提出聯合國下年預算三千三百四十六萬九千五百八十七元之建議，較本年預算（三千四百八十二萬五千一百九十五元）少一百卅五萬五千六百零八元。賴依之建議，見諸其向巴鑿聯合國大會召開在即提出之預算報告中。</p>
<h3>美國大選前奏曲之一　第四黨的誕生</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>紐約航訊　民主黨本身的分裂，無疑將造成十一月共和黨必勝的機會。今天，凡是腦筋淸楚的政治觀察家，都認為杜威將是明年白宮的主人，殆無務問。第三黨費城代表大會時，華萊士的競選經紀人鮑爾溫說：「杜魯門澈頭澈尾，是一個笨蛋，他完全出賣了羅斯福一貫的政策」。鮑爾溫還說：「羅斯福總統在臨死以前兩星期，曾經很誠摯的說過，民主黨需要華萊士，特別在今夭（一九四五年）這種非常的局面！」</p>
<p>但是「不幸的」是華萊士在一九四五年並非副總統，陰錯陽差，造成了今天民主黨的大分裂。飽爾溫說：「分裂無疑造成杜威的勝利，但我們（指第三黨）不能不打起這旗幟，第三黨的機會在一九五二年，或者一九五六年！」</p>
<p>美國到那個時候，是否需要華萊士？至少在現在，還不能回答這問題。本來，民主黨的分裂，不自今日始。我在一九四六年寫給本報的通訊裏，就一再提到民主黨左右翼的分家，那時候，華萊士還是堂堂商業部長，勞工部長施倫伯還沒有逝世。事隔兩年，民主黨想不到竟弄成這樣一個大分崩的局面。華萊士的第三黨（進步黨）以外，還有了第四黨（傑弗遜民主黨）。『民主黨』的總統副總統候選人，一共有了六個，杜魯門和巴克萊的一組，華萊士泰勒的一組，寒蒙德和拉安脫的，又是一組。</p>
<p>塞蒙德是南加羅里那州的州長，拉安脫是密西西比州的州長。都是典型的南方人，他們代表的是美國南方的利益，他們的主張，大部份還是美國南北職爭時代南方的主張。當七月十二日民主黨全國代表大會在費城舉行時，民主黨的大會官言中，提出競選的政綱與政策，杜魯門和北方若干州的負責人，決定的所謂國民基本櫂利一章：（一）民主黨堅決主張廢除「私刑」；（二）反對不合理的人頭稅；（三）反對人種歧視；（四）國民職業機會平等；這幾項遭逢南方若干州的代表强烈反對·亞拉巴瑪州的前任州長狄克逼　出修正案，主張罰除這幾項硬性規定，尊重各州的地方權限，提高州政府輿州　　的權限，斟酌各地地方情形分別辦理。亞拉巴　的修正案，在大會中，以九二五票對三〇九票被否決，引起南方代表的狂怒與憤懣。當賓夕法尼亞的參議員梅逸宣讀大會宣言時，密西西比州代表有先退出會塲，亞拉巴瑪州以及其他南方六省的代表相黨追　，演成民主黨的悲慘的第二度分裂。</p>
<p>就歷史看，美國民主黨起於南方，南方是民主黨的老巢，當第四黨，傑弗遜民主黨的全國代表大會，在亞拉巴瑪州的北明罕城舉行時，有位北明罕的大商大斯丹潑說：「南方的民主黨人，對北方代表的强兇覇佔，甚為氣憤，南方黨員認為兒子踢出母親。」用中文來講，就如同「數典忘祖」，這不過是三個商人的直覺的想法。我以為大會中狄克遜（亞拉巴瑪前任省長）講的話很具體，他說：北方的民主黨員，不明瞭南防幾州的特殊環境，他們强姦南方人民的公意，準備在南方造成社會革命，這種革命，必然引起大流血與大混亂，將會數滅南方的安定的社會</p>
<p>他還說：南方人並非不懂得尊重人權，凡是關於種族平等，宗教自由等等，在美國的憲法中罕有明文規定，南方人民一向信守憲法，何必杜魯門「多此一舉？」接着，密西西比的州長拉安脫號召，凡是主張擁護州的自治權益，凡是反對杜魯門的男女，都希望集合到北明罕大會的旗幟下來！」</p>
<p>南北戰爭時代「邦聯制」的旗幟，飛揚在北明罕，八十年來，美國在各方面都有了進步，惟獨這個「黑人問題」，將永遠成為國家的心腹之患。黑人問題引起種族歧視，連帶及於各州的立法，聯帶及於「聯邦集權制」和「邦聯制」的爭辯，因之才有林肯時代的「南北戰爭。」想不到南北戰爭結東以後八十年，北明罕街上，又出現了南北戰爭的英雄李將軍的鉅幅畫像。</p>
<p>北明罕大會還推選了總統和副總統的候選人，原來預備選舉阿肯薩斯州的州長蘭南，做總統競選人—一個有名的硬漢子，典型的「南方機子」，他對杜魯門總統的「不賣帳」，博得很多南方人的喝彩。但是，後來忽然因為意見分歧，蘭南不願被推為總統候選人，臨時才決定改推塞　　和拉安脫</p>
<p>第四黨預料在十一月大選中，可以獲取全部南方的選票，甚至有人認為可以贏得中西部的票子，如同奧克拉霍瑪州，印第安那州，甚至杜魯門的家鄉米蘇里州的選民的擁戴·但也有人認為不能過份樂觀，亞拉巴瑪州的民主黨主席麥考凡，在大會中主張南方人不要露醜，他認為要推舉像艾森豪威爾這樣有聲望的人，做第四黨的總統候選人，才能够贏得十一月的勝利。他認為千萬不要推舉自已小圈子中人，因為不能獲取全國性的勝利。麥考凡的意見，並未為大會所接納。</p>
<p>也有南万人，根本反對北明罕的「叛變會議」的，喬治亞的參議負羅塞爾，就是最有力的一個。羅眾爾在費城民主黨大會上，總統候選人的投票時，得過二六三票，一個在南方極有聲望的政治人物。他反對黨的分裂，他說，「我反對杜魯門，我要在國會參議院席上反對他，我不參加叛徒會議！」</p>
<p>當杜魯門從費城洋洋得意回到白宮，宣佈召集國會特別會議的消息發表以後，記者們找到羅塞爾，他說得很幽默：「民主黨的又一個不幸事件」！</p>

<h3>美間諜案調查委會主席　責杜魯門封鎖情報　將提出控告請總統解釋</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕美參院調查政府「忠實」方案委員會主席福開森，今日聲稱：行將控告杜魯門總統，因其自持不可容忍之總統架之，拒以重要情報，提供國會。杜氏拒向調查委員會提供關於前戰時生產局職員雷明頓之忠實資料，雷氏已被控為蘇聯間諜網人員之一。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕參議員福開森七日在參院內發表演說，謂國會正被迫處於不能容忍之地步，或盲目通過立法案，或促使總統解釋其在調查共黨案內之行動。福氏指斥杜魯門本週內拒不向國會調查人員交出正在共黨間諜案內之聯邦政府雇員之忠心問題調查紀錄。福開森以參議院調查委員會主席資格發言，福氏所言或為渠於一九四五年四月任職以來對總統所發動最嚴厲之抨擊。渠稱，國會必須與杜魯門攤牌，因總統之傲慢，正已至不能容忍之地步。按杜魯門五日曾指福氏之調查委員會之間諜案審查及衆院非美活動委員會之聽取共黨陳述事，為旨在使人民忘却國會拒不通過渠之反通貨膨脹建議及其他建議。杜氏斷然拒絕以任何聯邦政府屆員之忠心問題調查紀錄給予該二委員會。福開森指斥總統及其行政機構之舉動，意圖隱瞞過失。渠並謂國會曾撥款一千一百萬元使完成政府雇員忠心問題調查紀錄之計劃，故有權知悉此事進行如何。福氏復稱，總統與國會間之關係，已因保守秘密一點而至緊張限度。</p>
<p>新「神秘證人」　今日出席報告</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約七日電〕負責調查在戰時深人聯邦政府之某共黨間諜團之衆院附屬委員會，七日傳詢最近曾向共黨全國大會要求重行入黨而遭拒絕之前美共黨領袖勃羅特，但渠並非負責調查人員口中之「神秘證人」。據官方透露，此「神秘證人」將為退黨之共產黨員高留爾，渠將於九日在華盛頓當衆報告全部故事。</p>
<p>在華盛頓衆院非美活動委員會代理主席麥德稱：附屬委員會已抵此間，特別為詢問高留爾而來。以後，渠又稱：某一蘇籍女敎師在詢問中行將缺席，渠目前正因被「綁架」之問題，成為蘇聯領事館與某一反蘇團體問爭辯之中心人物。高留爾曾於六日晚在聯邦大廈內受附屬委員會之秘密詢問，衆議員聶克遜稱；「渠為吾人所傳詢之任何證人，問等重要」。麥德以前亦曾在華盛頓稱：此一神秘證人「將能向委員會提供有價値和直接的資料。關於某一與共黨間諜團接觸之人氏，此一共黨間諜團又係能與共產核心人物晤見者，吾人有理由相信，此人係在間諜團內部工作者，亦係唯一能與間諜團內部接觸之人員，至於此人是否仍在政府中供職，則余不能說明。」</p>
<p>蘇女敎師被綁　案情極為詭異</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約七日電〕紐約蘇聯總領事洛茂金，七日將一蘇籍女敎師隱匿於領事館，並稱，渠係被逼自白俄綁架者處將其救出，然國會偵查間諜之領袖，又立即稱，其為彼等搜求多日之主要證人。洛茂金稱：該女敎師係於七月三十一日在紐約被綁，當時渠正擬啓程返蘇。洛茂金自稱，係於七日在離此七十五哩之農塲中將渠敎出。女名高遜基娜，以前曾在紐約敎授蘇聯外交人員之子女。洛茂金並譴責蘇聯大文豪托爾斯泰之女里奧·托爾斯泰曾協助綁架，渠稱：其他之蘇籍敎師一人及其妻兒，現仍被「白俄土匪」扣於新傑賽。然里奧·托爾斯泰小姐稱：高遜基娜係自願赴托爾斯泰農塲者，渠恐遭蘇聯官吏謀殺，如渠之丈夫然，「渠留在農塲時非常快活」，但當渠看見領事之汽車駛來時，即開始戰慄，並稱「渠將設法回來。」托爾斯泰小姐並力斥洛茂金之聲明為「一片胡說。」高遜基娜夫人七日在洛茂金總領事館舉行之記者招待會中出現，渠稱：「在渠留居於農塲時，所供之食物及所受之待遇均佳，但被逼須在廚房工作。」</p>
<h3>波捷促進　經濟合作</h3>
<p>華沙會議通過決議案</p>
<p>〔塔斯社華沙七日電〕波捷經濟合作會議，曾於本月四日至六日在華沙開曾。該會在其決議中，强調必須促進波捷經濟合作，尤其是在　務與生產方面。預定今年將締結五年商約，根據新約波捷兩國間的貿易額，到一九五三年將達九十億或一百億克朗（捷幣）擬建設大工廠以滿足兩國的需要，並已規定計劃共同開發資源，建設煤氣與電氣網。又已決定增加鐵路，內河及海洋貨運量。波捷經濟合作會議，議定確立關於兩國間長期經濟方案的調整制度。</p>

<h3>以色列求和　可能為試探性質</h3>
<p>阿盟答覆恐難業觀</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅特易七日電〕以色列國請求開始和談之建議，昨日下午已由聯合國調解專員貝那多特送交阿拉伯國家。據接近貝氏之人士稱：阿方答覆恐難樂觀。此間若干觀察家懷疑所謂和談建議，根本為試探阿拉伯態度之一種手段，蓋阿拉伯國家如接受以色列所提出之和談，則無異「在事實上」已承認以色列國，而阿拉伯聯盟迄今拒絕考慮對以色列承認。接近貝那多特之人士，認為即使阿方接受和談之建議，和談亦必毫無結果。貝氏對渠本人之任務，雖表樂觀，認為巴勒斯坦問題終能覓得和平解決之辦法，然若干接近貝氏之人士，對戰火可不再重燃之點，頗表懷疑。</p>
<h3>日首相蘆田　仍強調中間路綫</h3>
<p>認為左右傾均不利日本</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京八日電〕在東北各地旅行中之蘆山，粟栖等，昨日晨在大立車站接見當地新聞記者時稱：「目前日本之政治情况，一方面極左之傾向非常危險，同時另一方而極右之傾向亦頗强烈，此兩者均將阻碍日本之前途，故中問政治之主張非常必要。將來担當此項政治責任者，將為中央聯盟或中央黨，本人回返東京後，將立即從事此項採取中間路綫之中央聯盟政治組織。」</p>
<h3>勞倫特將繼金氏　出任加拿大總理</h3>

<h3>蘇聯正在銳意建立　從事戰爭龐大機構　重工業中心移西伯利亞</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日電〕本週出版之生活圖畫雜誌，根據業已公佈之資料，撰載論蘇聯經濟及軍力之特別報道。其所根據之資料，係若千月來專家努力探尋之成績，或係由不能問接表明身份人士所透露者。生活雜誌此一報道之結論，為蘇聯正建立從事戰爭之龐大機構。蘇職重工業之建設中心，已逐漸移至西伯利亞。該報道中並謂，蘇聯在貝加爾湖以北及隣近太平洋岸地區，建議龐大之工業機構。如蘇聯於一九五〇年完成其第四次五年計劃，則即令蘇聯失去其所在西部領土，該國仍可以西伯利亞為中心，從事戰爭。蘇聯刻在貝加爾湖以北，建立大規模治鐵廠，該地產煤甚豐，生鐵質地亦佳。蘇聯在隣近中國新疆之阿爾馬阿塔，亦設立工業機構，採煉鈾礦。同時在伯力·及海參崴北部，亦均設有新工業機構，蘇聯開發西伯利亞之市要意義，為使該地成為可供應龐大軍隊之需要，及不易被轟炸之工業堡壘。關於蘇聯之軍力。生活雜誌認為蘇聯即無原子彈，其軍力亦相當可觀。蘇聯在陸軍方面，擁有全球最大之常備兵，在空軍方面擁有飛機一萬四千架，其海軍刻正計劃擴充潛水艇，蘇聯在重工業之生產量刻已達成或超過其一九四〇年之水準。</p>
<h3>英國的「工聯會」</h3>
<p>— 本報駐英記者　本耿</p>
<p>英國現在是工黨執政，工黨有兩個組織作為它的基石。一個是費邊社；（Fabian　Society）前已簡為介紹，另一個即「工會聯合會」。而為本文所擬簡述者。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>英國是工業革命的發源地，因此，不但「工仰」的由來甚久，就是工會的聯合組織，也有它悠久的歷史。但是作為現在「工仰聯合會」之起源，那麼第一個「工會聯合會」是一八六六年在曼却斯特舉行之聯合會大仰。這一次到會的代表一共三十四人，代表了十一萬八千三百六十七工人。一八六九年，工會聯合會就曾經討論國會中之勞工代表問題，並且組織了一個委員會，以執行聯合會的决議案。自是以後，工會聯合仰大會就問續的討論有關社會立法問題。一八八六年組織了一個勞工選舉委員會，不過這個委員會是受「自由派」分子的影響。一八九〇年聯合會通過了一個議案，贊成「八小時工作制法案」，也許可以說從這個時候起，它開始　棄經濟的個人主義，而趨向於社會主義。上述之勞工選舉委員會於一八九三年停止活動。一八九九年通過了一個決議案，從事於社會主義者組織，其結果為「勞工代表委員會」之產生，與次年工黨之成立</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>工黨是一個政治團體，工會聯合會雖則也含有政治性，但是應該說是職業團體。工黨的產生雖則有賴於工會聯合會，但是兩者並不就是合一的，不過兩個的關係，十分密切。工黨產生於一九〇〇年，而自一九〇五年起，就有一個聯合委員會，由工會聯合會·工黨·以及當時的「工會聯盟」（這個聯盟也是工仰聯合會支持產生的）三者聯合組織。一九一四年工會聯合會決定改組這個機構，一九一九年工聯會通過了一個計劃，一面決定擴大內部的執行機構，它一方面決定了與工黨聯合組織的辦法。一九二〇與一九二一工聯會大會與工黨大會都先後接受聯合辦法，成立了一個聯合組織，由雙方派遣人員構成之。因此，工聯會與工黨的關係，也許可以說是橫的關係而不是縱的關係</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>工聯會自一八六八年到一九四七年，一共開過七十九次大會，它所代表的工人，不斷的增加。一八六八年為二八·三六七人，一九〇〇年為一·二〇〇·〇〇〇人，一九二八年為三·八七四·八四二人，到了一九四五年為六·五七五·六五四人。一九四七年的第七十九次大會，到會代表八百三十七人，代表了十八大類的一百八十七個工會，與七百五十四萬三百九十七工人。（本段數字根據工會聯合會第七十九屈報告書）有這樣多的工人　它的力量，自然是很可觀的。</p>
<p>另外，我們歷年工黨黨員總數與工會工人參加工黨的數字逐年激增，我們可以肯定的說，不但工黨與工聯會有密切的極的聯擊，並且由於工會參加工黨人數之衆多，以及其所佔工黨黨員總數百分率之高，可以想像到兩者究竟是怎樣的一個關係。去年，工黨的黨員數目，開了新紀錄，但是我們應該注意的，如以一九四七年黨員數（四·六八五·六五九人）與一九四六者比較，是增加了一·三六三·三〇一八，但是工會參加工黨者却增加了一·三九六·〇八八人。換言之，普通的黨員却减少了，這說明了工黨的基礎所在。也無怪乎工然政府的許多政策，都必須有工聯會的同意。有人因為費邊社有許多知識份子，以為工黨是一個書生組織，看了這個數字，即可了然。這裏也給若干對政治有興趣者以一個啓示，任何政黨，想發展，想執政，固然少不了書生，更少不了的是老百姓。英國人口總數男女老幼總計不過四千五百萬到五千萬之間，四百六十多萬是總數的十分之一左右，然而我們應該了解的，是這十分之一所代表的質是很重要的，如果將小孩子算在外，則它所佔的比　，自然不只十分之一。這樣的一個政黨，如果領導得法，應該是有前途的。（六月五日寄自倫數）</p>

<h3>寶山路雷雨中慘禍　永備廠死傷九十人　觸電起火工人不及逃避</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨午三時廿分，大雨雷電聲中，閘北寳山路三九三統永備內衣製造廠，發生雷擊走電起火慘劇，死傷竟達九十人，佔全廠員工百分之八十以上，誠屬駭聞。</p>
<p>永備廠房屋共計五層，建築相當堅固，且新加修繕，但廠中並無避電設備。昨日慘劇，肇始於該廠二層縫組間，縫紉間平日有男工五十三人，分在四檯工作，裝置電熨熨斗四只，附近並有電馬達二只，電力為全廠消耗最大之處。午後三時廿分，雷雨傾盆而下，霹靂一聾，全曆電綫，突遭雷火襲擊，頓時燃燒甚熾，全體工人不及逃避，即被灼傷，慘呼求救。聾聞屋外；時三樓亦有女工十一人縫釘鈕扣，男工十餘人正在刮漿，四樓則為整理間，有男工廿餘人，五樓為宿舍，電綫亦經延燒，三四樓男女工友下樓不得，紛紛由窗戶躍至馬路，致跌傷者甚多。</p>
<p>該廠對面路旁，適有一警亭，雷聲響處，駐警忽見二樓一陣火光，突聞慘呼，知已發生火警，急電分報滬北區救火聯會及消防處，數分鐘內，滬北救火會出動救火車八輛，敎護車一輛，消防處總隊出動帶浦車四輛，雲梯車二輛，急救車三輛，至目的地後，出水灌救，並將跳樓受傷之男女工人，分送市立第四醫院，市立第五醫院，公濟醫院等急敎。火至四時五十五分始全部撲滅。除二樓作檯及內衣原料大部分被燬外，底層及三四層均無多大損失，五層樓宿舍部份損失亦甚輕微。</p>
<p>事後調查該廠此役中受雷擊觸電而當塲焚斃者計四十六人，傷車送院不治而死者十人，留院施治者十人，經包紥後出院者廿四人，合計傷亡共達九十人。該廠廠主蔡鴻笙及其眷屬等五人於火起時，倉皇奔逃，亦同受灼傷，現住市立第五醫院。</p>
<p>尙幸未及底層</p>
<p>據該廠僥倖脫險之男工周明楊告記者，火起時彼適在三樓平車間工作，驚惶中隨衆躍窗，墮地時僅頭部略受微傷，據稱全廠工人共一百〇四人，內女工十一人，廠主及其家眷均住於廠內，此次幸賴施救迅捷，禾曾延及底層打漿間，蓋是處儲有製科學軟領用之原料，如賽璐珞，丙酮等多種，茍一爆炸，則更不堪設想，言下尙有餘怖。</p>
<h3>死傷姓名</h3>
<p>至受傷者除廠主蔡鴻生，妻戴氏及戴氏弟媳四人外，工人方面計有男工謝根耀，胡豪，余存華，楊上達，杜松年，在長林，吳作章，陳國泰，，戴根生，王瑞祥，馬公慶，高如良，曹錫康，謝祖康，沈生正，唐治林，王乃明，張富林，陳永林，符阿男，潘永發，劉文林，毛乾，潘雲台；女工吳愛相，在士賢，孫愛寳，劉桂英，陳公芬等卅四名。死者五十六名昨已昇送常德路騐屍所，姓名經查出者計李金根，劉金岩，高玉菇（女），戴龍氏（廠主之岳母），沈國富，虞有福，張瑞林，陳勤心等十八名。</p>

<p>本市直關當局頃據密報：共匪頃在本市秘密設立一收買壯丁機構，專事秘密收買壯丁，每名出資六千萬元至一億元不等。該批壯丁經收買後，每次集中十餘人，專程秘密送往蘇北匪區加以嚴格訓練後，分派至最前綫工作。彼等在滬收買之對象有三：一，難民，二，學生，三，貧困工人。然均須靑年，其收買方式，係假借投效國軍為名，分別誘騙給資，致受騙之靑年頗衆，經抵達該地發現並非國軍而潛逃返滬者數人，已向本市有關當局報告，當局現已根據綫素，加以偵查，聞日前已拘獲數要犯，正嚴訊中。</p>
<h3>僞造出口證舞弊　眞相大白　糧部兩科員潛逃　夏樹輝被拘偵訊　醫生陶有信亦就逮</h3>
<p>本市江海關發覺偽造糧食出口證案，業經全案破獲，案犯葛承齊·孫仲一·丁星五三名，業已移送地檢處訊辦。南京方面偽造出口許可證主犯糧食部管制司科員周玉永，田賦署科負王克强，則已聞風潛逃，刻正由首都警察廳刑事警察隊追緝中。另二主犯中華診察所醫生陶有信，糧食部管制司科員夏樹輝，則已經首都警察廳刑事警察隊捕獲，經漏夜審訊後，據悉牽涉頗廣，係一有組織之貪污案件，刑警隊方面尙在根據口供偵查中。茲探悉破案經過如下：有住居本市泗涇路十五號烟台雜糧商人馬見齊（山東人），於月前向烟台市府申請，獲得准予進口五千包之進口證，同時有住居本市花園飯店四百六十一號商人葛承齊（山東人），亦向靑島市申請准予進口麵粉四萬包。經靑島市府批准，並發給麵粉進口設，唯核减為一萬二千包，兩人乃</p>
<p>聯合委託一名孫　一者，向南京糧食部方面活動出口證，孫轉託一糧食商人名宋冠九者，宋則介紹南京同仁街六〇號中華診療所醫生陶有信，陶當允代為設法。陶有兄名陶有志，開設復興油號於山西路九十八號，陶有志因常往糧食部治購公敎人員配給油，故與糧食部某兩職員甚為熟識，遂將馬·葛二人在靑島·烟台兩市所請發之麵粉進口證，持與糧食部方面人士接洽。七月廿五日，陶電告在滬之馬·葛二人，謂出口許可證業已辦妥，催其</p>
<p>來京洽領·二人於廿九日由滬返京，取得出口證兩份，發給烟台麵粉之許可證，為批交烟台新泰行者，糧食部方面出面接洽者，為該部管制司科員周玉永·夏樹輝，田賦署科員王克強，言明每包付手續費（即代辦出口證費）五十萬元，兩批一萬七千包，共計手續費八十五億元。馬·葛當付出黃金十兩三錢一分五厘，王·周二人出樣一紙，內寫：「今借到陶有信先生名下黃金十兩三錢一分五厘，餘款待糧食部通知代電到滬後交淸」下署王克强·周玉永，其條日期為本年七月二十五日。馬·葛取得出口許可證後，即</p>
<p>持之返滬，於本月四日下午二時，由永豐利報關行丁星五偕葛至江海關辦理麵粉出口手續，當經海關緝私課發覺，該證兩件海關方面並未接獲糧食部代電通知，再詳加審閱，竟發現所印之糧食部印鑑，較原有者為小，字跡亦略有不同，又證上監印人印鑑，中有一字，與原留者不符，當即</p>
<p>認為假冒，乃由該選派港幣將　·丁二人扣留，詐加偵訊，葛乃將獲得出口許可證之經過情形供出，至是否偽造，實不知情。海關據供後，即將在滬之孫仲一拘獲，並立即電糧食部調查事實眞相。馬獲悉此事後，遂亦風夜趕往南京，向刑警二分隊指控糧合部科員周玉永·夏樹輝·工克强欺詐騙財，警方據報，即派幣將介紹人宋冠九·陶有信二人傳隊，訊得眞相，於六日下午，由刑警二分隊班長訪糧食部管制司劉行驥探詢，經劉司長查明，此二出口證</p>
<p>係屬僞造，而與此案有關之管制司科員周玉永，數日前已請假離京他去，田賦署科員王克强，亦於五日上午私自離京，行踪不明，至管制司科員夏樹輝，則仍在部辦公。警方乃派員將夏拘捕，惟因該案牽連甚多，南京方面已予密切注意，刻首都刑警隊已調撥大批幹員偵查中。</p>

<h3>四十二位女警員英武不讓鬚眉　工作效率克臻理想　足為都市女性吐氣揚眉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在最近都市職業女性中，市警局四十二名女警員相當受人矚目。渠等均曾受高中及專科學校以上之敎育，平均年齡為廿歲至廿五歲，浙籍較多。去年經警局公開招考，以水準較高，最後錄取者僅四十二人。經入警察訓練所訓練後，於今年元且中正中路警局閱兵典禮時，渠等即告正式結訓，開始勤務。</p>
<p>此四十二名女警員，體格均健美，如殷佩證小姐，曾代表警察隊參加本屆全運，舞劍表演一傷，旋轉似飛，颯然風起，博得不少贊譽。江健羣，湯素珍二小姐，更長身玉立，在元旦閱兵行列中担任舉議，英武之狀，足為都市女性揚眉吐氣。此外尙有一葉英小姐，被稱為「女警之花」，伶俐活潑，故受派在交際科担任工作。</p>
<p>渠等唯一特點，在各種技能均能平均發展，益以胆大心細，致一切內外勤工作效率俱克臻理想。如在刑事處偵緝科紀錄股中，對檢　指紋，分析心理，偵查罪犯等工作，均應付裕如。其他如參加特種營業檢查，及編制戶口卡等，貢獻亦大。尤以參加經濟警察大隊工作之女警，如朱大鈺小姐等曾化裝顧客，於最近破獲大規模黑市金鈔案多起，厥功尤偉。</p>
<p>現該批女警均寄宿於警局西部宿舍中，生活自由，並無嚴格管理，渠等認為目前服務環境與在學校時並無多大差別。</p>

<p>關於本市救濟特捐，雖經市政當局一再勸募，舌敝唇焦，但輸將者仍未見踴躍。頃據記者探悉，特捐募集委員會迭次開會商討之後，對於特捐之募集，原已決定三項涉驟，第一，先由市長以私人名義宴邀各豪富階級，請其即席認捐若千（其認捐數字，事先由勸募會擬定。）第二，如第一步不成，則由吳市長親叩各豪富之門，面請捐輸。第三，如叩門請捐無效，則公布各豪富姓名，再請其認捐，並擇其在敵偽時資敵有據者，公布其劣跡。刻以上三項辦法，第一項業由市長宴邀，但被邀者多不到，故第一步顯已失敗，日內將執行第二步手續。</p>
<h3>熟睡遭猛擊血濺床第　國代王冠英夫人命危　兇手為夫友暗殺動機有兩說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江西國大代表王冠英之妻閔彬如（見圖），昨晨五時二十分在寓所遭人暗殺，性命危殆，兇手李宗光當塲就逮，事後據其家人稱：兇殺動機，純為謀財害命。惟據兇手李宗光在警局供稱：則此中情形頗多曲折，認為王妻恩怨不分，不堪譏諷奚落，乃忿而出此。</p>
<p>李現年三十八歲，湖北人，與王冠英原為至友，勝利前在重慶交往頗密，去歲因所營之酒精廠失敗，經濟窘迫，乃輾轉來滬，投王處寄宿，且不時向王作將伯之呼。昨又因調用頭寸，為王妻所拒，思及過去曾於王冠英競選國大時，奔走出力，而今備受冷淡，遂起狠毒之心。</p>
<p>按王妻閔彬如，為江蘇吳縣人，現年四十二歲，曾留學美國，得哈佛大學敎育系碩士學位，在抗戰期間，曾任重慶各大學敎授，西南中學女生部主任，及慰勞總會江西分會會長等職。勝利後即來滬，寓居新大沽路中和新邨五號。李宗光寄寓王處，已有半載之久，不幸於此期內，雙方友誼發生裂痕。昨晨四時閔始由外歸，甫及熟睡，即為李宗光乘機潛入臥室，以鐵錘向渠頭部猛擊，當被重傷後腦左眼等處，一時血濺滿床，痛極在呼，旋為其姊閔堅如所聞，首先入內將兇手抱住，繼由家人飛報警局，始將兇手捕獲。</p>
<p>當兇案發生時，適王冠英在京，迨昨晨七時獲訊後，即於下午趕乘飛機返滬，現此案正由新成警分局偵查中。被害人閔彬如經送中美醫院救治，聞傷勢非輕，未離險境。</p>

<p>渠稱：中菲兩國，無論自種屬血統經濟，政治等各方面觀，均有密切之關聯。故各方面均應爭取合作。渠對目前我國大批資金，逃避於港洪一事，表示費解。據告：菲律賓目前大有可為之工業，有紡織業，造紙業，三夾報業，冶鑛（金鑛）業等，均待開發，前途利益豐厚，亟待各界有識之士，多多投資，藉以增進菲律賓興外邦經濟交流之關係。</p>

<p>奧氏在太平洋戰後，尙屬初次來滬。據稱：戰前渠常利用假期，不定期旅行來滬。此次與滬闊別十載，認為滬市外貌，一切如昨，似未遭受戰神之浩劫，街道且整潔逾恒。惟滬市內質之劇變，頗使渠驚心動魄。此中尤以通貨之膨脹，尤屬尖銳急劇。以菲京馬尼刺言，外貌慘遭毀損，建築支離破碎，街道蕪雜不整，與滬市不可同日而語。惟所幸內質尙佳，經濟金融情况，較為安穩，但生活程度，顯已較戰前大為提高，一般中曆之薪工階級，生活較受影響。惟勞工階級，每日出賣勞力結果，平均每人約可收益美金五元，生活情况，較諸敎師階級，反形優裕。至旅　華僑，顯已佔有菲地之零售市塲。渠甚望華僑能團結一致，為大衆之利益而服務。</p>
<p>勾留數日　即行返菲</p>
<p>渠對此問米糧價格之低廉，頗表驚異。因菲地之米價，每石須美金十元。據稱：菲地並不禁止黃金自由買賣。黃金官價每兩為美金卅五元，惟市塲買賣價格，常　徊於美金四二元左右。除美國以外，菲地黃金，不准日由輸出於其他國家。最後渠詢及本市各日報銷行情形，順告記者日：菲京以馬尼刺時報（Manila　Times）銷行最廣，日可銷七八萬份。奧氏在滬尙有數日勾留，預計將於本週內返菲云。</p>

<h3>公用事業漲價問題　公用局答參會質詢</h3>
<p>市公用局對八月六日參議仰公用委員會議各參議員提詢各點，擬就書面一一加以答覆如下。</p>
<p>（一）各公司七月份虧負特鉅，確係事實，故均直接陳報市長，請求救濟，其後在各報發表，亦均直陳事實，似非製造空氣可比。</p>
<p>（二）此次調整價格，關於電力電話煤氣三項，採行差別制，原為顧全一般少量用戶之負担，且此係尊重議長暨市長之意旨而試行者，倘參議會另有決定，自當照辦，此項差別制，對於小用戶確為便宜。</p>
<p>（三）關於公用事業調查委員會報告上海電力公司三十七年三月份收支報表，有須說明者，即該表支出部份之「股息」，「利息」，「折舊」，「其他」四項，其數字雖大，但僅為賬面表示，而其現金收支，實屬虧而非盈，故其收支總數並不平衡。本局核算價格，並不依照賬面支出，而係依照公式計算。其中「其他」一項，並不計入，即「股息」，「利息」，「折舊」等項，亦僅有少量計入。</p>
<p>（四）各種價格上泓倍數之計算，自應以平均價為準，故關於電話價格，如以三百次以上每次三十二萬元之價格為準而認為上漲一千萬倍，恐欠準確。蓋事實上必須打過三百次以後，方照高價計價。又從前二路電車外灘至靜安寺者，在二十五年間，每票查係六分半，並非銅元三枚。十六路無軌電車每票查係一角，亦並非銅元五枚。故認為上漲一千五百萬倍，並非事實。</p>
<p>（五）價格計算公式之基數，均係依照通例及當地寳際情形而議定，如關於公共車輛，用油每加侖行駛里程數，在上海因係市內交通站頭特短，而在鬧區紅綠燈特多，故每加侖祗六公里許，但行駛郊區者已達七公里餘。</p>
<p>（六）外商公司外籍職員薪給用美金折算者，固有其事，但此項人員在戰前即與公司訂有合同，現在繼讀履行，此項人員現僅剩四八人，尙在繼續减少中。至其他未訂合同之外籍人員約一百人，則均照本市生活指數支薪，與華籍員工相同。</p>
<p>（七）以前每月請整價格，其指數部份均用上月數字，以致公司方面虧損甚鉅，現則改用當月指數，在指數未確定前，姑照上月數字加上50％，作為估計數字。</p>
<p>（八）現行公共交通票價，對於里程遠近之差別性所以規定甚小者，在欲减少近程乘客，以减少擁擠程度，維持交通秩序，並便利遠程乘客。</p>
<p>（九）外商公司之專營權，須予繼續承認，係依照中美中英之平等新約協定之原則，但外商公司現旣受吾國政府之管理，市政府所採之政策，為尊重人合約，執行法令。</p>
<p>（十）上海電話公司之機件修理工作，大部份確由中國電氣公司承辦，其故由於大多數電話材料該公司與電氣公司訂有供應合約，但新材料價格如向國外訂購，則受國際價格比較所牽制，不能任意提高。</p>

<h3>濟市資匪走私機關　破案記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　麗天</p>
<p>〔本報濟南五日航訊〕由於上月十三日兗州的素守，其主要原因不在共匪戰鬥力的堅强而在謀報工作的意外成功——以致共匪的諜探深入國軍各級部隊，連李玉堂司令官的機要秘書也是「八路」，李司令官的臥室床下也會發現到炸彈——因此，大大提高了此間軍民對於這一方面的警覺性，則時並加强其戒備。</p>
<p>偷運電機臺　圖換棉花小米</p>
<p>在某部的多方努力下，濟南最近破獲了」個空前大規獲的以各種物資（包括軍用器材）資匪的走私機關。時間是在七月廿七日黎明，在濟南經一緯五路西開　着義泰和貨機的副理孫茂堂（曾任空軍地勤部隊特務上士）於其助手孫學良協助下，雇了輛蕭有淸的大車，（是經常往來運送貨物於濟南及魯北匪區的）。實際上所裝的是四大箱無綫電五個啓羅瓦特發報機十一匹半馬力發電機及其他通信材料，在上層則放了許多金汁大糞作偽裝，孫等費了兩個多月時間的籌劃，百七十餘億元的運動應酬下，自然電機就很順利地通過了所有的關卡和檢查站，於廿七日淸晨，平穩地送過了黃河，到了甜水井，孫等這時心中眞如一塊石頭着了地，由高興而得意，由得意至忘形，滿以為這次任務圓滿達成，錢是賺穩的了。以一個時値不過數百億的電機及電台，能够換到棉花十萬斤，小米廿萬斤（據孫等口供）時値達二千餘萬億，此非「一本萬利」而何？</p>
<p>武裝匪百餘名　開槍集中射擊</p>
<p>正在孫等興高彩烈之際，尾隨其後的某部工作人員以事不宜遲，就强迫他們再把大車運回黃河南岸，孫等此時始知「功敗垂成」，但在衆寡懸殊下，不得不又把大車車運上船，船就離岸再向南岸划來，而船離岸還不到五分鐘，就有担任接應該批物資的「武裝八路」百餘名，趕到黃河邊，目擊該船南駛，就集中射擊，企圖强迫該船再駛回北岸，這時，船上的某部人員除命船伏加緊南划外，同時並嗚槍還擊，預為埋伏在岸上高梁地內的另一部某部人員雖人數不多，但因都是能「雙手開槍」的神槍手，故岸上河心一陣夾擊後，匪摸不淸某部的實力，無心戀戰，倉皇間只得北遁，向其根據地引退，所苦的是當槍聲緊密時，河中其他民船，因爭相逃避，不幸發生互遺而沉沒了一艘，身葬魚腹者達廿餘人。「人贓」一併解到某部後，孫等自然無從抵賴，在孫等供詞中，知道該義泰和經理李錫貴股東閻鳳來等，都是「八路」，惟已逃往德州，李是匪夏口鎭工商管理局派來濟市專門代匪運辦物資的。</p>
<p>扣押廿餘要犯　查封五家商舖</p>
<p>孫茂堂等於被扣押後，「無巧不成書」的是與該義泰興貨棧同院的某君平日鑒於該棧出入人員龐雜，且於晚間多有便服携槍人員出入頻繁，即已判斷絕非善類，此次風聞某部截獲一重大走私案後，該棧人員即逃避一空，每日僅派一人來棧看看「風色」某君適有友人在某部服務因即走吿，至廿九日，除將該「望風」人員吳王珠（曾任空軍招待所上士班長）拘扣外，同時，又拘獲由匪區派來担任聯絡之趙海波一名，在吳等供詞中，又悉：該項電機，是經由泰昌商行向某軍事機關購得並負責修理裝運等技術事項，同時供出者復有利和油糧棧，藝華皮鞋店等，連前共有五家皆與共匪有來往，至於該件的運出是通過了劉文玉（魯省府調查室洛口代理組長）鄭連元，蔣振來等的關係而運出，某甲用了多少億，某乙又拿了多少億，北時也全部和盤托出，因此，由此案而華連被押者已達廿餘人，查封商號亦達五家。</p>
<p>王耀武已表示　主犯決處極刑</p>
<p>此空前的軍用通信器材走私案自破案後，濟市人心莫不為之一快，某部的負責人向王司令官耀武觀：司令官當然知道兗州李司令官的臥室床下就發現過炸彈，我們是來替王司令官淸除炸彈的，至於怎樣懲辦，那全由司令官作主。」當時，王司令官除深表贊許及嘉獎外，並表示為首者於審訊明確後決處極刑，藉儆效尤，並手令副官處盧處長登科及軍警稽查處周處長專生協同辦理，在盧周等的有效合作嚴密佈置下，該案的要犯因得大部就擒。</p>

<h3>關外行（三）　敦煌石室之夜</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州二日航訊〕七月十七日上午，教煌鄒縣長陪我們去城東南的月牙泉遊覽。十餘華里路，牛車在沙地上行駛極緩，往返足走了兩個多鏡頭。月牙泉是在一羣純沙小山的中心，最高的一座呌鳴沙山，高約廿餘丈，長約五十里，寬約廿里，假使一二十人結隊自山頂順沙滑下，沙與沙相摩，再加四面沙山的回音，會發出很大的嗡嗡聲，但我們上山的人不多，只在山頂瀏覽了一下。月牙泉水澄情碧綠，形如新月，據傳漢武帝曾在月牙泉得過一匹飛馬，騎之一日夜可抵安西，現在泉旁有「漢渥窪池」的碑蹟。泉邊有六座廟，皆為道敎興建，塑像除藥王廟外，無甚可看。</p>
<p>千佛洞　開闢經過</p>
<p>中午返回敦煌縣城，略事休息，傍晚即乘汽車去千佛洞。千佛洞又名莫高窟，在敦煌縣東南廿公里之三危山下，從三危山流出的雪水，把沙山冲斷，形成一溝，溝寬約兩三丈，溝底為碎石子而平坦，東岸高約一二丈，西岸高由一丈至二十丈不等，石室就在西岸的懸壁上一排排　洞而成。</p>
<p>敦煌石室的開闢經過，據陪來同遊的縣府陳秘書說：沙州志的記載是「永和九年癸丑歲創造」，此窟的創建時期，當在西曆三五三年，當地的道人又說起建窟的動機：沙山旣被南來的山洪冲斷，西岸的高處仍有流沙，當日落時，因沙係五色（我們自軍上遠望却為混然一片的白色），被日光反映，成為萬條金光，日落後即隱沒。到晋廣帝太和元年（西曆三六六年），有沙門樂僔見這種奇景，以為是佛光，乃在石壁上繫第一個窟，給塑佛相膜拜。後來，法良禪師又造了一窟，到北魏時再造數窟，唐代時佛敎大昌，已成窟室一千餘　，因而名為千佛洞。又據一般人的傳說：唐時通西城，莫高窟為過往的大道，所以送行，辭行的人都到石室動祈禱，以托神庥。後來，如意歸來，為酬神還愿，增闢石室，寫經獻佛，石室遂漸加多，此說較合情理。</p>
<p>一萬卷　唐人寫經</p>
<p>千佛洞有寺院數幢，分上·中·下·三寺，我們便借宿在下寺，寺旁即廠經洞，宋時西夏之亂，千佛洞僧人將避他鄉，遂將經卷，佛像等封藏於此。洞在甬道內，漆黑異常，我們藉手電筒的光來察看，洞並不大，可容十餘人，迎洞口的壁上，還有一輻宋代仕女畫，張大千有臨摹本。</p>
<p>道人說發現的經過：淸末有湖北王道士（圓籙），在光緒廿五年陰曆五月廿五日以流水疏通三層洞沙，沙出壁裂一縫，彷彿有光，破壁現一複洞，豁然開朗，內藏唐人寫經萬卷，古物無數，見者驚為奇觀，聞者傳為神物。那時，敦煌縣長在宗翰從王道士處取去若干寫經及畫像，轉送一部份給學台葉昌熾，葉曾建議把這些遺物遝往蘭州保存，後因經費無着而令封存。</p>
<p>光緒卅三年，匈牙利人斯坦因從王道士手中，盜購完整長卷寫經三干卷，殘破者六千卷，共裝廿四箱，又佛畫及繡品五箱遝往倫敦。次年，法人伯希和以重金再向王道士盜買一千五百多件。其後，政府雖一再令飭妥為保存，仍多被盜買，我們來時，已無緣再睹唐人的寫經了。</p>
<p>研究所　發揚藝術</p>
<p>如今敎育部已在該處設立教煌藝術研究所，以期研究發揚這中國佛敎藝術的寳藏，同時，還新建起一所陳列館，把臨摹的各代表作品陳列比較，而新的洞窟，也不斷的發掘出來。關於莫高窟的研究工作，國內已有不少的闡揚，我們在此處一夜的停留和四小時的劉覽，僅僅獲得一個概念：　　窟隨着時問的進化，將來不難成為我國藝術的中心，因為它的包羅實在太浩渺了。</p>
<p>研究所所長常書鴻先生因公赴京，由一位段先生陪我們參觀，那天，我們談到子夜才休息。據他告拆我們：安西還有一個萬彿峽，（即榆林窟），作品比較完整，具有系統，過去因為地方不靖，打算今年冬天去作長時期的研究。另外，敦煌縣城西還有幾窟，可惜已被人盜竊去不少。</p>
<p>千佛洞之夜，是我平生最不易忘記的一夜，窗外萬籟俱寂，夜凉如水，只有白楊蕭蕭，月光舉着那蜂寞似的石寳，淸風吹得寺角的銅鈴作響，極遠處還不時傳來野狼嗥叫。</p>
<h3>濟南發現怪井</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南八日電〕此間頃發現一人禽入內後立即死亡之怪井。本市經三緯十路聯勤總部濟南被服廠內，原有敵為時期所挖掘之洞井一口，平時作為貯存雜物之用。六日晨，該廠工人張玉敏（廿四歲），赴井中存放物品，多時未出，經人發覺，無病身死，當由另一年長雇工下井施救，不料該雇工入并後，呼救信號大作，立即上拉，幸免於死。該廠員工睹此情景，另以活鷄一頭拋入試驗，果亦立斃，聞該廠已將經過轉報法院，請求檢驗。</p>
<h3>夥刼麥船　謀財殺人　無錫白蕩圩命案　五匪就逮主犯逃</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫七日訊〕江陰人朱新寳等，於上月廿一日由澄裝運小麥來錫出售，途經縣屬白蕩圩地方遇匪。同夥劉阿七，任銀福，王琴錫，王進生，及朱妻素英等六人，悉被綑綁，投入河中溺斃。所運之要亦被匪劫去，數日以後，屍體在原處發現為狀至慘。素英因懷有身孕，胎兒竟從下部流出，經當地鄉民打撈上岸後，報請地院派員相驗，確係謀財害命。案發後，各方震驚，周縣長特下令所屬，限期破案。迨至上月底，張村區署突接情報，認為北西漳一帶賭徒，嫌疑重大，乃會同縣府情報室，按址將嫌疑犯孫阿秉，孫阿錫，趙小狗，徐福林，孫順根等五名拘獲，呈解縣府審訊。本月二日，軍法室首次開庭時，各犯對參加殺人越貨。已自認不諱。據趙小狗供稱：「起意搶劫的是劉振和等四人，當天前往動手的共有七人，短槍兩支是劉振和的長槍兩支是孫阿秉的，小船是孫順根的，由徐福林搖至沿蕩河口時，發現麥船，首由劉振和喝令停靠，然後逼迫麥船土男女六人，全部上岸，詞將小麥印入小船內，後來因向他們要現鈔金飾，他們拚命抵抗，劉振和就叫我們動手，用繩逐一綑縛，將金鈔等搜出後，即全部拋到河中淹死。」並謂劉是新四軍派來的，故案情業已大白。三日，縣府又派員下鄉將尤寳興拘獲。詎於前日繼續開庭時，各犯突然翻供，對於初次庭訊時所供各節，全部否認。匪犯徐福林竟稱初次庭訊時，因神經病發作，故信口胡言，不能憑信，惟軍法室認為本案眞相已經明瞭，俟主犯劉振和坸到後，即可定議，昨已再度派警　文吳江，商請該縣警局會同查拘劉犯，務獲歸案法辦。</p>

<h3>潘將軍背大槍　帶着兩個老百姓　深入遼中農村去　本報記者趙展</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽四日航訊〕記者沿遼河南向「口袋」深處旅行，到了距牛莊二十公里之處，所經過訪問的都是綠野農村，綠色掩不住荒凉情調，在許多外表相像的村子中，看不到一副紅潤的面孔，一頭肥胖的猪，一隻生蛋的鷄，農村是沉默憂鬱的，「一副苦險，半條破褲，」最足以說明農民生活的貧困。我在茨榆駝村的一個農家，和幾位前方將領曾見，坐在葡萄架下，芙蓉花前吃西瓜，別是一般滋味。前方部隊中的各級官長及士兵均有堅定不移的信心，其鐵的紀律尤博得民衆的感戴和擁護。</p>
<p>泥潭中的車子</p>
<p>由前方回司令部的中途，有一個印象最深刻。七月廿四日薄暮，我們一行四輛吉普加連趕奔回程，記者及另一同業與潘裕昆將軍同坐的車子跑在前面，其他車十落在後邊，由不同的兩個渡口駛過遼河浮橋，因此便失掉聯絡，同時車子欲走近路，便離開縣道，駛入鄉道，請一位農民作響導，他上了汽車便迷了方向，當農村點藏於夜的黑幕中時，我們的車子已駛入泥潭，司　無能為力了。由最近的村子請兩個靑年的農民來帮忙，費了一小時工夫，車子還是在泥裏不能前進一步，於是一個農夫自願去較遠的大村子找人和馬匹來帮忙。我們便坐在麥田裏等候，這時，天空一邊閃耀着疏落的星星，一邊黑雲密佈，不時透出一道電光，風吹送泥土的香味，吹過高梁地好像遠處傳來千軍萬馬的聲息。潘將軍一點也不焦燥，就和靑年農夫聊天，這靑年人愛他最有趣的話題，他說在鄉間娶老波要有七匹布才成，「八路」在的時候，因為婚姻也實行「配給」制度，大姑娘們都搶着出嫁可意的人，就如揀一個最甜的桃子一樣。現在國軍來了，姑娘出嫁，又要七匹布了。他又率直的告訴這一位不知階級的官長，他村子裏的鷄都被「八路」吃光了。東北的農民眞可愛，一會兒來了十幾位，拉來兩匹兒，一陣吆喝，車子由泥團中拉出來，他們很高興的揮手與我們告別。他們完全是自動的帮忙，沒有一點勉强，車子前進了約五里路，又陷入泥裏，這回只好徒步走路，我們走進第一個有駐軍的村子，哨兵不相信這位將軍是軍長，因為他背了一枝大槍，　　我們兩個「老百姓</p>
<p>放寒風限運尺度</p>
<p>遼中收購小麥的情形很好，一方面由於地方政府的努力及軍隊的協助，另一方面收復之後，匪幣作廢，老百姓急需鈔票換點東西，出售小麥是唯一的辦法，鄉村流通的是流通券，關金還不吃香，遼中四個收購站每天收購達六萬斤，其中困難不少，例如籌碼太少，老百姓要等候拿錢，磅秤太少，老百姓要等候過磅，政府也感到人手不够。這種收購的辦法是「公有·公遝·公存」的制度，以便於統籌軍糧。農民則希望「私有·私運·私存」，這問題始終沒有解決。以記者觀察，限運的尺度應該放寬，政府准私運以百斤為限，還要請領准運證等等手續，無異自已封鎖，才收復的土地與農村有一串政治。經濟·社會的問題等待解決，需要加速解決。</p>
<p>遼中三害待除</p>
<p>記者訪問許多農民，知道遼中有三書，亟待剷除：（一）是游雜部隊，騷擾地方，（二）是諜報人員，為非作惡，（三）是遼河水患，年年泛濫。遼中一縣收復不到半月，游雜部隊有十五單位，四千餘人，吃穿化用均取之於民，有一個朱某自稱「團長」，被繳械後，其身份證上寫的是：一務踢的卜者」。</p>

<h3>一般物價　間歇時期已過去　物價又直綫上升</h3>
<p>一般物價走勢，到上週末為止，已有兩週餘的間歇時期，上週在銀根一片鬆濫聲中，兼之全國交通工具及滬市公用事業紛紛調整新價，且上泓輜度頗鉅，本有掀起市塲物價泓風可能，但由於上月杪將總統召集翁院長等，在莫干山會商，有擬具新經濟改革方案及平抑物價之緊急措施等傳說，其後市塲復盛傳，當局有將黃金收　國有，及凍結保管相之舉，此事雖經國行俞總裁鄭重否認，但一般大戶，神經敏感，頗有人人自危之狀，成抱觀望態度。及後因新經濟方案，遲遲未見公佈，自週五起，市塲物價，幾又呈直綫性上升之勢。</p>
<p>上週批發物價總指數為五，一七七，八六四倍，較前週上升百分之九·二二〇，上週銀根鬆濫，國行差出極鉅，週五一日，差出五萬七千餘億，創空前紀錄。據分析係由於：（二）央行之差出，係現鈔流出較少，收付頭寸，均集中在交換方面。及（二）大批定貨貨款流出的原因，暗息走動於五角上下。上週結匯證市氣甚佳，迭見騰升，由週初之五百二十萬曾一度升達週末之七百萬以上，加外匯基準價，已接近黑市。飾金自恢復營業業後，上週略見漲落，趨勢穩定，週初行市較高，進三億九千萬，出四億三千萬，以後微有回落，週五起又漲至週初原盤，週末再升，進四億二千萬，出四億六千萬。</p>
<p>上週全國交通工其，及滬市公用事業調整新價情形如次：</p>
<p>第一，交通工其；（一）各綫輪船客貨運價，自八月五日起實行調整，增加成數為百分之一百二十。（二）全國各鐵路客貨運價，自八月六日零時起實行調整，計客運價目，按照戰前每公里一分五厘之標準，普加九十萬倍計算，並即取消現行區問計算辦法，而以各站間實際里程核收。貨運價格，則照戰前每公里十公斤二分之標準，普增二百萬倍計算，其最高數額，約合現價之兩倍左右。（三）中央中國兩航空公司，自八月五日起，車行調整各綫票優，較前增加百分之三十四。</p>
<p>第二，滬市公用事業調整新價，水電等自八月一日起算，交通事業五日實行，新價與上月價格之比較，計水增三倍弱，電增一倍二至三倍零，煤氣增一倍至二倍六，電話增一倍半至二倍九，電車平均增二倍三，公共汽車平均增二倍二，小火車增一倍儿，輪渡增二倍四。</p>
<p>這一次滬市公用事業新價調整過高，對於市塲人心，刺激至深，對於物價，也着貿有領導上漲的作用，市參議會已注意及此，我捫覺得公用事業與全市市民生活息息相關，大家是有權過問的。</p>
<p>就政府方面措施而論，其與平抑物價有關者，約有下列數端：</p>
<p>第一，蔣總統於七月杪，在莫干山召開會議商討，擬定新經濟改革方案，據透露該方案內容，第一步驟係着軍平抑物價之緊急措施，次一步驟為改革外匯政策，吸收僑匯，及鼓勵出口，最後之步驟則為改革幣制。關於平抑物價方面，聞將裁併全國金融機構，舉辦全國行莊總登記，提高資本額，其不合規定行莊，將分別令其停業或歸併，目前全國金融機構共六千餘單位，裁併後將僅存三分之一。</p>
<p>第二，新任上海金融管理局局長林崇墉氏，於二日正式到職，稱：「當前之金融狀態，已發展至極端畸形之境地，行莊之多，甲於全世，業務之壞，達於極點，例如行莊開支，甚至有超過其存款總額者，若長此以往，其禍害不堪設想，如不認眞執行銀行法，將危及整個國家社會。防止之還有二：（一）明是非，（二）辨善惡，業務正常者應加保讓，業務惡劣者即予淘汰。」就林氏這一番談話看來，政府今後對金融管制的趨勢是要加强的。</p>
<p>第三，據美援運用委員會發表，數至七月三十一日止，業已運抵中國之美緩物寳，計米四萬二千六百七十四長噸，麵紛八千九百二十九長噸，棉花七萬零三百七十萬包。另悉第二批美援棉花，亦於日前由美國經濟合作總署批准。計三千三百七十萬美元，即日起可開始始動用。</p>
<p>此外紗管會前奉令撤消，現該會各部門正趕辦結束中，至今後商廠對國內棉花採運一購銷等事宜，悉聽自由，將不受政府任何管制。</p>
<p>上週物價，在前述囚紫因，週初週中，因對新經濟改革方案之即將公佈，尙不無顧忌，及至週末，似已不耐久待，多升見新高價。紗布方面，如四十二支監鳳，由週初之二十億升至週末之二十四億二千萬，二十一支雙馬，由週初之十五億七千萬升至週末之二十億，龍頭細布曾破七千萬大關。天橋絲由週初之二十二億二千萬，升至週末之二十七億七千萬。糧食市塲，自週五起，因受運價調整之影響，上白粳升達四千三百餘萬，油粉等亦追隨上升，週末再升，白粳破五千萬大關均創新價。其他如日用品，化學品，金屬等，亦多循此種趨勢，週五以後，價創新紀錄。　上海批發物價指數按用途分類者如次：</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次：</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如次：</p>
<h3>貨幣·金融</h3>
<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>上週本市銀根，鬆極至濫，分析其車要原因，可得下面幾個：（一）市塲因流言盛傳（如經濟改革方案等）而稍呈呆滯，國家行局乃得　機大量吸進結請證及麵粉等物資，再加上其他支出，致自週一至週五五日內，行局之差出竟在十四萬億元以上，據估計，至週末為止，本市之游資已超過五十萬億元，則銀根之鬆濫，乃為必然之結果。（二）各地匯款紛紛湧來，其問尤以津并兩埠為多，據說每日解訖之匯款，多至二萬億，少亦在五千億以上。（三）市塲買賣雙方旣均呈觀望態度，業內外需單目較前大减，致頭寸供源旺盛，市塲銀根乃益見鬆濫。</p>
<p>這種銀根鬆濫的局面，雖然不過是惡性通貨膨脹的萬象之一，但牠的嚴重性，已愈見變本加厲了。譬如行局的鉅額差出，譬如由物價高漲所引起的暗息昻騰，再匹如人民購買力的日益萎縮等等？每次都在創着一個新的記錄。此次銀根的極度鬆濫，顯然是再一次物價猛烈漲風的前奏，這是値得吾人深為警惕的。</p>
<p>上週暗息，以做五角四分最為普遍，但在週三以前，最高有至六角以上以至七角半者，週四以後，因行局鉅出，銀根鬆濫，晴息跌入五關，週五竟有以三角九分拆出者。此外如貨幫貼息，一週來亦因銀根之由鬆趨濫而迭降，其間如棉紗帮貼息竟自週一之四十五元直瀉至週五之十五元。</p>
<p>國家行局庫，自週一至週五，計共差出十四萬二千六百八十七億，較銀根鬆弛之前週，竟增出六倍達十一萬八千餘億，可謂創行局差出之空前記錄。更右進者，上週行局差出賴實際上恩尙不止此數，如週二那天，行局對五千倍以上之票據，即只准用轉帳之方式抵劃，可知上列差出數字當較實際差出為小。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，一週來多單普遍，頭寸益見鬆濫，致同業拆放難於做出，六十號以後行莊交換結果，自迎一至週五，計共差進八千〇八十七億，而其中尙包括合灣銀行四萬五千四百廿七億之差出，故扣除此數不計，五天內問接交換之實際進額竟達五萬三千五百十四億，較前週同期內尚增進六萬八千多億，問接交換之如許鉅進，也是前所未有的，行莊頭寸之寬，昭然可見。</p>
<p>至若外商銀行，上週目週一至週五，共計差進七萬三千一百六十九億，比前週同期內增進四萬億有餘，茍無洋商銀行此項鉅進，可料上週銀根之鬆勢，更將成泛濫之局。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週內匯匯率，波動尙平，穗匯匯水週一為三百五十元，週二至週四增為四百元，週五再落為三百元。廈門匯水自週一至週三為五百元，週四降為四百元，週五再降為三百元，這可能是需款轉殷，南匪减少與漲風重吹的先聲。渝匯滙水於週四以前均為一百五十元，週五加五十元為二百元。漢匯匯水週一二為一百八十元週三四升為二百元，週五再回至一百八十元。津匯始終維特平匯。</p>
<p>上週外匯行情，結匯證價格因盛傳外匯政策將改變，進口許可數簽出甚多，以及當局大量牧購而劇漲，如週一做價為四百五十萬，嗣後續升，至運五價已達六百四十萬。銀樓乘飾金掛牌價格週一為四億三興四億元，週二因謠傳黃金國有而暴落至三億八及三億四，其後謠傳過去，價又堅挺，週五復返週一之高價矣。上週香港申匯，上半週雖見放長為八分，但週四又見開始短縮為七分港幣合法幣十萬。香港美鈔做五元四角六分，黃金每華兩週三曾落為三百廿九元，週四又升見三百卅二元五角之高水準。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>週初謠諑紛紛，多空各有千秋，股市起伏，頗失常態，永紗甫開即漲至一三八六〇元停板，永業，聯華，中興，閘北，中火，水泥等七種亦追蹤漲停，嗣後利空消息熾盛，突又在瀉，午後收盤，大體較上週末略見漲落，波動不大。次日因新經濟改革方案消息，益見具體，大戶觀望，永紗曾一度跌停，終以一一八〇〇元收市，他股除永業，聯華兩種站立漲限外，餘一致下降約半成之譜。週三仍不脫疲境，進入盤旋之局，結果永紗軋升二三〇元，以一二〇三〇元收盤，餘股漲跌互見。週四雖銀根鬆動，但因金管局出動大批人員，檢查金融市塲，故買方仍不無戒心，各股漲勢不大，永紗漲至一二七五〇元收盤，他股交易淸稀，價徵見上升。週五起因久陷疲境，靜極思動，復由行局連日鉅額差出，市上銀根奇鬆，銀行帮，金業帮爭相購吸，趨勢步步上揚，午後經數度盤旋，臨收特俏，永紗，中火，中衣，聯華，永業五種升達漲限，其他各殷，除梅林　獲外，均上漲半成至一成半不等。週末因新經濟改革方案中，有改革幣制之傳說，認為上漲　數較多之嚴，將見下跌，反之則漲，致形成冷漲熱　之局面，計永紗以一三九八〇元收盤，較上日小挫，中火，中絲，水泥，閘北，永安，商務等多種冷股，均見軋升。</p>
<h3>商塲到戰塲</h3>
<p>最近以來，當局對於工商界的若干措施，有採取所謂「不管」態度的跡象，在某些塲合，管制太多，固足以使工商業窒息，但在另一些塲合，撒手不管，也可以造成工商界無比的禍害。警如就上週公用事業一漲就是兩三倍這一點來說，無疑的是加重了工商業的負担。按公用事業加價的直接理由，主要的一點是由於各公司虧蝕過鉅，不漲價無法支持，但問題的癥結顯然如參議曾議長在「反漲」的小組會上所說的，第一，中央對整個經濟，財政金融沒有辦法，則物價不斷上漲，公用事業自亦不能例外，地方政府只能頭痛醫頭，脚退醫脚，故欲求穩定，收效甚微。第二，過去市參議會一再建議中央，公用事業所需外匯准予三個月結匯一次，所需燃油煤斤亦准予三個月購買一次，但中央未予採納，致演成今日嚴重之情事。姑且不問此次六十餘參議諸公的反對公用事業漲價是否會得到實際上的效果，但有一點是顯然的，即公用事業的所以一再漲價，乃當局「撒手不管」的後果，而當局之所以不採所謂貼補政策而寗願放手不管，並甘為與論民怨的衆矢之的，乃是因為他們的便宜外匯，他們的法幣老早作其他用途去了！</p>
<p>但是，僅僅在有關民生的公用事業上節省外匯的消耗還是不够的，例如中央銀行外匯審核委員會，亦會於上週週二舉行第二次會職，據說該會審核原則仍本政府節約外匯之政策，嚴絡處理，關於進口商進口貨品所需之外匯，仍由輸管會審核決定。不但如此，當局對於行將到手的美援物資的運用的考慮，亦已煞費苦心，據報載政府這期內將建議美國，以出售援華物資所收回之通貨，作平衡財政預算之用。又據美援運用委員會委員嚴家淦表示，出售所得款項，部份將予凍結。此種以美援物資投入黑市市塲的「自由買賣〕政策，除達到「部份凍結法幣」的目的以外，顯然有相當一部份是會用在籌措外匯頭寸上面的，可見為了軍事的需要政府勢必儘一切可能去節省或獵取外匯，則公用事業的一再漲價，也是不足為奇的了。再者，此次美援棉花夏有易紗外銷以及美援肥料易糧內輸的決定，雖然說棉花易紗輸出後可以轉購外棉進口，但一轉手間，自然會賺到更多的外匯，至於紗價是否會因外運而猛漲，當局好像亦無法顧及。肥料能變糧食進口，除所記「减少發行捉進糧食增產」而外，自然對戰事也有直接帮助的</p>
<p>關於部份開放自備外匯一點，一週來亦已成為輿論界及工商界所熱烈討論的課題，市工業會籌備會特為此於上週週二召集工業界人士舉行座談會。週四下午進出口公會更邀　了工集界，學者，及輸管會代表，舉行了一個類似的座談會。我們只要參考一下會中輸管會輸出推廣處陳處長的意見，則此次政病頒佈這一辦法的苦心，已可灼然如見了，陳氏認為國人在外資金，回國投資原料可以顧及，但原料變成　成品，化為法幣頭寸後，再出國購取原料，似欠合理云云，顯然原料變成襲成品後，化為法幣再出國購取原料，政府就不可能因僑資的回國而增加其外匯收入了，雖然這種做法對工商界及生產有利，但這豈是政府的最大目的呢！輸管會秘書長更說得一針見血：「這辦法為何公佈，直截的說是希望在不費國家外匯的原則下，輸入國內缺乏的器材和原料……同時更得注意，這些工廠復工後，所產製成品如何使其有出路，並不套取墨市外匯。」顯然「所產製成品出路」在當局的心眼中有兩個，第一，供政府收購，第二，製成品外銷後所得的結匯證售給政府，這當然是充裕外匯頭寸的一種算盤。一句話說完，現代的戰爭，是需要消耗鉅額的外匯的啊！</p>
<p>一週來國家行局的空前差出，據說其間一大部份是當局大量收購結匯證及麵粉等物資的價款，這使人不禁想起旬日來市塲上種種的謠傳及大鈔發行後的去路，是否利空的傳說使市塲暫得穩定，而後大鈔一批批放出，物資一批批扒進，假如不幸而如此，則工商界再一次的驚濤駭浪，恐怕也為期不遠了。</p>
<p>商塲不但如「戰塲」，而條條商塲的路，也不難看出已與殘酷的戰塲密切的聯緊起來了！</p>
<h3>展望新經濟改革方案</h3>
<p>— 蔡潤嵐</p>
<p>談到新經濟改革方案，我們不禁就想到逝去不久的「舊的」經濟改革方案，復員以來，在這一方面可得而述者，先有宋子文院長時代的經濟緊急措施，顧名思義，這是一個比較臨時性的辦法，我們且不去管它了。及後到張羣院長時代，在行政院下，設立全國經濟委員會，一口氣通過了經濟改革方案，大有勵精岡治之意，當時的方案，包括金融，生產建設，財政三項大目標，涉及整理國家銀行，建全縣銀行，建設農業，工業，商業，交通，聲理財政，穩定幣値諸端，最後更充滿樂觀空氣。結諭稱：「總之，生產事業不可一日無金融之滋養，財政收入，亦不可一日無生產事業之支持，金融政策，經濟政策，與財政政策三者，互為因果，相濟相成，不可須臾或難。本方案所述，其已由政府施行尙未著效者，應由主管部會加强實施：其應立即實施及準備實施者，應出行政院分交各主管部會妥擬詳細辦法，迅速實行。其次是本方案推行順利，尤須注意者有三：</p>
<p>（一）為合理解决官兵公教員之待遇，使能維持最低必需之生活，俾行政效率得以提高。（二）為國營企業與民營企業應立於同等地位，不可使有軒輊，尤不可使一部私人企業受特殊之待遇，致正當之民間事業增加困難。（三）為應在社會方面，發動廣大之經濟建設運動，提高民間對經濟之了解與興趣，並以官民協作之力量，排開經濟建設之困難。以上各種改革措施，誠能本此配合進行，則現時之生產萎頓，物價飛騰，稅源枯涸，收支失平之現象，立可改觀，庶幾生之者衆，食之者寡，為之者疾，用之者舒，則財恒足，財政經濟之危機乃可挽救矣。」</p>
<p>這一個改革方案，文章是做得很美麗的，至於它的成績，可以不必去如何檢討，自有事實的答復。</p>
<p>關於生產方而，我們聽到的是原料不足，管制過嚴，生產機構，紛紛向香港逃避。關於物價，根據中國工商協會所編的批發物價總指數計算，載至今年八月份第一週止為五百一十七萬七千八百六十四倍。關於稅源及收支方面，財政部長王雲五於六月十六日公開報告，今年五月份收入為十五萬億元，支出為七十五萬億元，收入僅及支出的五分之一。現在連當初設計的機構全國經濟委員會也明令撤銷了，這一個方案還找誰去兌現。</p>
<p>此次翁文灝院長的新經濟改革方案，只聽樓梯嚮，不見人下來，耳聞已熟，詳細內容，尙未明文公佈。但據報上一　半爪的消息說：「翁內閣所擬新經濟改革方案，經上月三十，三十一兩日，由蔣總統召集有關方面人士在莫干山曾商，就各項問題作原則上之決定後，行政院即將根據新方案，擬定各項實施步驟，按其性質分期公佈實行。據官方消息靈通人士透露：該方案之第一步驟，係着重平抑物價之緊急揹施，將首先提出於四日政務會議討論，如獲通過，則可於五日公佈施行。次一步驟則為改革外匯政策，吸收僑匯及鼓勵出口。最後之步驟則為改革幣制。至其他各步驟實施之時期，則視平抑物價之效果及當時實際環境而決定」</p>
<p>現在我們來批評新經濟改革方案，因為它還未見明文公佈，似乎尙缺少了一種根據，不過平抑物價，管理外匯，改革幣制這幾點確是當前經濟問題中的主要課題。不妨姑且一談。</p>
<p>平抑物價已經是一個老生常談的題目了，癥結所在，究竟政府收支能否平衡？不平衡有何法彌補？通貨發行能否凍結？在枝節的問題上，如公敎人員待遇照理應當提高，當局為應付政府環境，像戡亂會這一類的機構又不能不設立，這都是不易解決的難題。</p>
<p>說到管理外匯方面，爭取僑匯，政府最低限度，必須付出僑匯匯價與外匯黑市價相等，但這是否反應法幣更貶値？刺激物價更上漲？此外如何能在國內造成一個優良的環境，讓僑匯不斷來投資。鼓勵出口，也不是一個簡單的問題，政府已否有了決心，不在乎出口商這點外匯，讓它去自由發展；海外市塲的競爭，以及日本的再起，這已是當局諱莫如深的一個嚴重問題；再者，外來的援助，是不是白得的，貿易上應當如何去研究「互惠」。</p>
<p>最後是改革幣制，我們對這個問題不好有什麼話多說，不妨隨便的說一句，二十元法幣改成一元關金，不也是改革幣制嗎？何必要不憚煩的多討論。</p>

<h3>世運籃球錦標賽　三部秩序全排定　我國被列入第三部中　今日第一戰先逢瑞士</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本屆世運大會最緊張之節目，為籃球比賽，尤以第二組循環賽中，五隊勝負靡定，變化複雜，呈空前混亂，結果竟五隊同等成績，各為三勝二負。我國代表團當局不明竸賽規程，卒被屈列為第五名，至堪惋惜。名次決賽，已於上星期六開始，今日起繼續舉行，二十三國等第將全部決定。茲將各組名次及三部比賽秩序，分列於下：</p>
<p>第一部錦標賽</p>
<p>決第一至第八名</p>
<p>第二部淘汰賽</p>
<p>決第九至第十六名</p>
<p>第三部淘汰賽</p>
<p>決第十七至廿三名</p>
<p>各組名次</p>
<p>（第一組）（一）巴西，（二）鳥拉圭，（三）加拿大，（四）匈牙利，（五）義大利，（六）英國。</p>
<p>（第二組）（一）智利，（二）韓國，（三）比利時，（四）菲律賓，（五）中國，（六）伊拉克。</p>
<p>（第三組）（一）美國，（二）捷克，（三）阿根廷，（四）秘魯，（五）埃及，（六）瑞士。</p>
<p>（第四組）（一）墨四哥，（二）法國，（三）古巴，（四）伊朗，（五）愛爾蘭。　綜觀徘定各組秩序第一部錦標賽，將由實力最强之巴西與美國爭奪冠軍。第二部落選賽將由菲律賓對加拿汰或比利時決第九名。第三部則由我國與埃及奪第十七名。惟無論如何，舉世皆知，我國雖被列入第三部，第一部之韓國，第二部之比利時，皆曾為我國手下之敗將，亦良足自慰。籃球比賽制度仍未臻理想，缺點尙多，為一目瞭然之事。我國今日第一戰，將先逢瑞士</p>
<p>二組名次</p>
<p>第二組中名次之謎，終於揭曉。我國竟居第五名，據世運當局公布，係根據國際業餘籃球協會訂定之十四屆世運籃球競賽規程，各隊得分平均之計算方法，僅以積點相同之各隊相互間之戰績為限，對伊拉克之戰績，竟不計算在內。依此推算，則第二組並列第一之五强指數應計算如下：</p>

<h3>兩句俗語</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>我零裏零碎的看過點外國人批許中華民族的文章，覺得毀多於譽。其中羅素是最愛中國人的，曾說過這類的話：英美的文明儘管毀滅，只要有中國在，世界仍有文明。但是羅素的盛讚中國，却為魯迅所非，認為意存麻醉，居心不良。魯迅對於中華民族的觀察深刻，在富代數一數二，而其結論是悲觀的，即使不是絕望。</p>
<p>研究中華民族！如此之大，如此之老的民族，我怎麼敢。不過我們常常聽到常常看到的兩句俗語文，如果是話出有因，那麼就不得不對中華民族要歎一口氣了。那兩句俗語是：</p>
<p>飽暖思淫慾，飢寒起盜心。</p>
<p>試想想看，為人在世，總不外乎或則飽暖或則飢寒，現在飢寒了要起盜心，飽暖了即思淫慾，橫也不好，直也不好，豈不大弊。似定中國風調雨順，五榖豐登，或是黃金遍地，俯拾即是，四萬萬人中有三萬萬九千萬飽暖，只有一千萬飢寒，情形也不怎麼美觀，因為起盜心的雖僅佔絕對少數了，一社會秩序一不致破壞，而淫慾之徒舉國皆是，一國民道德一成何體統，一風化問題」豈不　重？反之如飢寒者多而飽暖者少，情形自更不堪設想。</p>
<p>我　希望這兩句俗語只是無稽之談，至少不能一概而論。然而擺在限前的事實，這兩句話不是話出無因，尤其是上一句。自從國難以來，發財的人不可謂少了，他們之飽且暖，當已一萬萬個沒有疑問，然而為國族與社會，他們盡了一絲一毫的力量沒有？運　天施茶施藥的功德也沒有做一點罷。何也？是不是越飽越暖之後，越淫越慾起來，一天到晚只在飽暖與淫慾四字之中打轉，昏大黑地得不知有國家社會世界人類？</p>
<p>而且假如這兩句俗語中的上一句是八九不離十，那麼下一句也有被促成實現的危險。黃金在中國畢兌不曾遍地，飽暖的人只思淫慾，淫慾之後又必愈思飽暖，飢寒遂普及人民，而盜心於以大熾，總有如火燎原不可遏止之一日</p>
<p>我想着這兩句俗語為中國的命運發愁。</p>
<h3>舊京菊花</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>北平為平劇發源地，在　名伶薈萃，盛極一時，今則世易時遷，大非昔比。爰將近月情形，分述如次。</p>
<p>戲院：　抗戰以前平劇院徧布城南及東西各城，電影院則僅平安眞光等數家，今則電影院多於平劇院，　之中和，慶樂，新新等院，已均改映電影，吉祥園，廣德樓，亦改為評戲，其演平劇者，僅有長安，華樂，市立（即以前之開明），三慶，以及華北等五院。其中之華北，尙僅演科班，各大　不往演也。此少數戲院中，以長安一院，地點適宜（在西長安街），建築精美，塲地寬大，各名角多在此輪演，惟潭富英則在華樂，三慶二院分演。</p>
<p>戲班：　賣座雖不振，戲班反轉多，計：（一）尙小雲，小翠花；（二）旬　生；（三）譚富英；（四）李少春；（五）業盛闌；（六）葉盛章；（七）裘盛戎、（八）楊寳森；（九）張君秋，　盛習；出毛世來。並有坤伶徐東明（　生），吳　秋（花且），梁　嗚（老生）等三班。此外復有臨時凑集之班，不能備述。葉盛　以小生，葉盛章以武莊，裘盛戎以花面，均各組一班，演大軸，掛頭牌，開一時創局，昔所罕見也。</p>
<p>賣座尙小雲：　尚小翠花，在平紥有聲譽，今又合作組班，自足號召，賣座尙屬不惡，但戲　甚廉，近月最優之座，僅每人八十萬（七月中旬，僅六十萬），比之戰前　値，不足二角，其餘則五六十萬不等。且賣座能在五成以上，即算不錯，若欲如昔之爭先購票，濟濟滿堂者，已不可得。於是而成下列現狀：（一）昔時欲得佳座，非老聽戲於看座諸人有經常父易及賞金者，勢不可能，近則無論何人，只須多給賣飛票者十萬至十五萬，均可得之。（二）主角自知難賣滿座，乃以戲票事先矚人兜售，美其名日紅票。此項紅票，如定價五十萬者，暗盤則只收三十萬，若能兜售至三十萬以上，則其　餘，即為　售人佣金，而　票者與兜售者之間，遂漸開討價還價之新例。（三）並有不能得餞之票，如軍　憲機關之贈票，榮軍席，以及前台茶房，於正戲上場後，將未售出之散座，　時招客，　收茶資及微賞，作為其津貼者。</p>
<p>配角：　各班均缺好配角，如小雲　花之班，竟無二路之鬚生，譚富英之班，亦無較可之花衫，致使許多好戲，因而减色，且有若干佳戲，須多數配角者，竟無法出演。所演者，不過有數幾齣戲，翻來覆去，令人乏味，且配角又以待遇太低，均不甚賣力，敷衍終塲，精彩益少矣。</p>
<p>科班：　現僅有尙小雲所辦之榮春社，出演於華北戲院，以前之富連成，斌慶等社，以及議劇學校，均早停辦。</p>
<p>總之，經濟與匪亂交迫之北平，恒人欲謀果腹，尙感不易，昔之歌舞鼎盛，自成過去。回憶二十年前楊余梅鼎足爭雄，更有老伶工陳德　襲雲甫，亦時於義務戲中出演，其餘名角，更不可勝數，眞感「此曲祗應天上有」也。</p>
<h3>世界上最自由的監獄</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>一個惡西哥人和他的家屬剛從一家餐館吃好飯。他與妻孥走上人行這時說：「本星期見面的時間已經完了。我們一同走回去吧——爸要回到監獄裏去。」</p>
<p>這是墨西哥一所大監獄中一個普通囚犯的生活。墨西哥的監獄，是世界上最自由的監獄，一向以儘量减少干涉犯人的自由為原則。犯人不但能携　　出外吃飯，還能繼績從事於貿　或買買。法律保證犯人們能得到與常人一樣的工資。</p>
<p>墨西哥城的監獄裏面，日常用品都有得賣。一個監犯開了一爿雜貨店，人民每天成羣地擁來買東西，因為他們知道這家店舖的生意做得不滑頭。這稱店舖的招牌上往往寫着：一包退遝洋」或「十年老店一等字句。</p>
<p>沿着「監獄大街」的店舖有：帽莊，成衣舖，理髮店，以及修理鞋舖等等。都是價　物美，生涯鼎盛。此外，還有相當好的承印卡片的商店，還有銀樓。</p>
<p>有一位做囚犯的律師，專替文盲寫家書及替同道上書高等法院。在他那監獄事務所的門上，貼着一張佈告：「光陰即金錢——請勿浪費我的時問。一</p>
<p>這監獄另一特色是小孩子可與女犯同住。當一個做母親的入獄時，她的孩子們可以母庸離開，因為獄官們相信女犯們有孩子作伴，足以使她向上。同時，當局又極力使被帶進監獄去的孩子們不受損害。在女監中，我們可以看見母親携了孩子在大道上走來走去。這大道兩旁就是一排排的房間（這種監房很大，且有像具，外面種植花木），大門開着。每所監獄附近，並有小學校，孩子們就可送到那裏邊去讀書。</p>
<p>學校外面又有一所大建築，預備孩子消磨他們的時間。每大自晨七點起到晚上睡覺，都　在那裏遊玩。同時，還在那裏進餐，洗浴，打球等等……一切的一切，都與普通社會生活　異。</p>
<p>墨西哥監獄的又一特點，是並不禁止性生活。一個已婚的男子可以讓他的妻子進　，同宿在一起。為了這個目的，所以他們大都特備私室，與普通的囚房隔開。</p>
<p>未結過婚的男子也可招引女友來探視，但娼妓則不准入內。一個女子祗准探望一個男犯。未婚者，常有老年人伴着前來。</p>
<p>依照墨西哥的法律，囚犯收入的百分之四十應給該囚犯犯案時的受損者。舉例來說：一個謀殺犯被判了無期徒刑，他就須將近半數的收入給那死者的家屬。百分之三十的收人贍養囚犯自已的家屬，餘下的百分之三十作為儲蓄金。</p>
<p>此外，凡入墨西哥監獄者，須受强迫敎育。每一監獄中都附設學校。受過高等敎育的囚犯則做敎師。</p>
<h3>唐蔚老灌音片一誤字</h3>
<p>— 高君賓</p>
<p>唐蔚老夫子讀書灌音片全套十張，由本市大由華唱片廠灌製流傳。該廠現任廠長范式正兄，與筆者在南洋大學時同　同學，此舉嘉　　藝林，有裨國粹。蔚師讀法，抑揚頭挫，高下疾徐，音聲感人，自有至理，家君聞而喜之，屬購一套，傾聽之下，發覺其中第十片唐若欽公（即蔚師之先尊公）迎春詩第六句「桃梗懸鼓並畫虎」，懸鼓之一鼓」字，似為「符」字之誤，因經便詢蔚師，蔚師復函云一吹萬先生有道，先君迎春詩中懸鼓之鼓，確係符字之誤，此詩因無稿本，僅憑弟記億背誦，未之敢改。延訛數十年，幸賴先生一朝糾正，銜感莫名」云。觀此乃知蔚師固早疑一字之差，今得家君商榷，認為確可正誤，此其虛心郵重為何如耶。用誌數言，以告同好。</p>

<p>他說，以　為　，出之　易。出之易故日多，多則輕，　則阻。善夫　律楚材為元壯　言，金世有司以出鈔為利，收鈔為諱，至以萬貫易一餅！今造鈔宜以萬錠為式，旣有定式定限，遂無前病。及元之中業，出鈔　多，賞番憎二千萬貫，鈔法又壞，此　之弊也。元鈔自五十至一貫為十一等，夫鈔以濟錢，今自為等，是使販夫販婦惟知用楮，天下遂無錢。鈔法壞，財必大細，此瑣之弊也。鈔法必信，乃可久行，以鈔法之壞，不深惟其失而更易新鈔，又以新鈔易舊鈔，號令反覆，民聽疑惑，新舊相積，鈔法愈阻，此「數變」之弊也。知其弊而後可以議鈔，知其弊而後可以用鈔。</p>
<p>上述「三弊一，可明受病之源；「二知」，以示著手治病之道。（知弊而後可議，知弊而後可用。）眞乃要言不煩。至於鈔票者有好制度，好運用，本是善法，旣便携帶，利行使，又調濟財政，活動金融，如宋之交子，元明之寳鈔，淸之錢帖，皆法久而弊生，每每致病民害國，則又有其原因：（一）是濫用，如上述金元主政時代，因以為利，便於揮霍，為變相的暴歛；（二）是濟念，如淸代成豐年間，為與洪楊軍對壘之嚴重時期，各省淪陷，財賦短缺，而軍費政費，一切又相需甚亟，不能不就「幣」上想辦法。前者人為之，後者時勢為之。</p>

<p>現在的通貨膨脹，有「外在」，「內在」的種種原因，比較舊時更為複雜，必須兼參國際及前後兩大戰後各國情形，然本文所述幾種原則，仍可借鏡，故略為分析說明。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th] The situation in Taiyuan is becoming increasingly stable. The Nationalist army on the periphery has been pursuing and suppressing the remnants of the bandits for days, with great gains. The bandit army, suffering heavy casualties, has changed its tactics, avoiding direct combat with the Nationalist army during the day, and engaging in sporadic harassment at night. At 2 PM on the 7th, a certain unit of the Nationalist army swept through the area north of Huangzhai in the north of the city, encountering over 200 bandits in the mountains south of Mapotou. After several hours of intense fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled north. At 11 PM, bandit gangs harassed villages such as Dayuezhuang and Daxiaohan east of Huangzhai. After being fiercely attacked by the defending troops, they scattered and fled. The Nationalist army on the west bank of the Fen River is still advancing southward step by step.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The departure date for Steelman, the director of the Economic Cooperation Administration's technical team to China, has been changed from the 8th to the 11th. According to a spokesman for the agency, the postponement has no special significance and is only because Steelman has decided that he needs more time to complete discussions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Senior officials of the Economic Cooperation Administration said on the 8th that the $245 million aid to China plan can indirectly help trade in the Far East (including Japan), in addition to direct aid to China. They denied that Japan would be built into an industrial giant and emphasized that China's reconstruction could utilize Japan's industry, which would be beneficial and harmless.</p>
<h3>Future Work of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Assisting Constructive Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 8th] Mr. O'Vay, Director of the Tianjin Office of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, attended the Tianjin Municipal Government's monthly meeting and spoke about the various activities and significance of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China. He said that the U.S. government had long believed that China would need various kinds of assistance after the end of the war, and the China Relief Mission, which ended its operations on June 30th, first launched food distribution in five major cities, hoping to solve the problem of people's food in people's livelihood. He emphasized that distribution is not relief, so the Cooperation Administration believes that the distribution price should be the same as the market price, because distribution does not distinguish between rich and poor, and allowing the rich to buy expensive grain at a low price would be unbalanced and would require government subsidies. Recently, it has been proposed to adopt high prices and encourage local food production to increase supply for distribution, so as to reduce government consumption. He also said that the Food Department has decided that the food ration from August to November will all be produced locally, and the Cooperation Administration will ship after November. The future work of the Cooperation Administration will focus on assisting constructive work such as industry, commerce, and agriculture.</p>
<h3>Huainan Railway to be Repaired in Sections</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Ministry of Transportation News: The Huainan Railway, from Tianjiadian to Yuxikou, is 208 kilometers long. It was ordered to be destroyed in October of the 26th year. After the entire stack fell in June of the 27th year, the enemy restored the mine road in order to seize the coal mines in the Datong area of Huainan. Since water transport on the Yangtze River was inconvenient in the 33rd year, a section of the track from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou, about 18 kilometers long, was dismantled and moved to repair the Shuijiahu-Bengbu branch line, about 61 kilometers long, to connect with the Jinpu Railway. After the victory, the bandits greatly destroyed this branch line again. It was not until June 1st of the 35th year that it was repaired and opened to traffic. The track materials required for the section of the road from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou were ordered from abroad by the Huainan Railway Company in sections. A part of them has already been transported to the site. The laying of rails on the section from Shuijiahu to Hefei began on July 7th. The section from Hefei to Yuxikou in the south will be repaired after the completion of the other sections.</p>

The relevant authorities also explained the reason for the change in the calculation method, which is to save time so that the cost of living index can be compiled as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Gong Xuesui Speaks to Reporters on Qingdao's Governance Policies: Four Issues - Grain, Coal, Refugees, and Transportation - Urgently Need to be Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 7th] Mayor Gong Xuesui spoke to reporters on the evening of the 7th regarding governance policies on the four issues of grain, coal, refugees, and transportation, saying: When in Nanjing, he had negotiated for hundreds of thousands of bags of flour, and 90,000 bags are currently on their way to Qingdao, ready for distribution, and he plans to distribute miscellaneous grains in the future. The coal problem is more serious and needs to be investigated. Refugees are filling the city, and he is appealing to all parties to advocate the "one bite of rice, one basket of charcoal" movement, thrift, and overcome the difficulties together. The past transportation company has been suspended, and public transportation is lacking. He has ordered immediate liquidation, and the city's public transportation must be rebuilt. Gong visited the bustling American black market this morning and said: "This is simply outrageous." He also told reporters that the past municipal government's running of newspapers seemed to be inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution and is being studied.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Formulates Implementation Measures to Relieve Refugees in Seven Districts; First Batch of Funds of 100 Billion Allocated</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Jiangsu Province's use of international relief funds to carry out relief work is in accordance with the Ministry of Social Affairs' "Refugee Relief Plan for Important Areas." The Jiangsu Provincial Relief and Welfare Enterprise Review Committee was first established to formulate the province's implementation measures for refugee relief and submitted them to the Ministry of Social Affairs to forward to the Executive Yuan to handle the allocation of funds from the U.S. Relief Materials Committee. The measures divide the province into seven districts, including Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Zhai County, Putong, Huaiyin, Xuzhou, and Donghai. Each district establishes a district review committee to promote relief matters, targeting refugees who cannot survive without relief. In addition to providing food to the elderly, weak, and disabled, those who have the ability to work are encouraged to participate in labor relief and the evacuation of refugees to return to their hometowns to resume their businesses. The Ministry of Social Affairs has now allocated 100.0157 billion yuan to the province for the first time from the U.S. Relief Materials Committee, which was remitted to the province's review committee for inspection on July 14. The committee reported that it has allocated 13,320,181,000 yuan to the Zhenjiang district, planning to relieve 7,000 people; 9,514,915,000 yuan to the Jiangdu district, planning to relieve 5,000 people; 5,708,949,000 yuan to the Nantong district, planning to relieve 3,000 people; 9,514,915,000 yuan to the Huaiyin district, planning to relieve 5,000 people; 28,544,745,000 yuan to the Xuzhou district, planning to relieve 15,000 people; 19,029,830,000 yuan to the Donghai district, planning to relieve 10,000 people; and 9,514,915,000 yuan to the Taixian district, planning to relieve 3,000 people. The remaining 5,007,850,000 yuan is for transportation and usage fees. The committee has also sent personnel to various districts to supervise and guide the active promotion of relief work.</p>
<h3>New Economic Plan Formulated; Song Ziwen and Yu Hongjun Fly to Shanghai This Morning; Zhang Qun Plans to Meet MacArthur in Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Since Mr. Song Ziwen arrived in Nanjing, people from all walks of life have been visiting him very frequently. On the morning of the 8th, Mr. Song went to the Christ Victory Song Church to attend the worship service. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the President, and many senior officials were invited to participate. At 5 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, President Weng Wenhao and President Yu Hongjun jointly visited Mr. Song at Beijige and discussed for a long time. It was reported that an important meeting was held at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence on the morning of the 8th, which was attended by President Weng and former Presidents Song Ziwen and Zhang Qun. At that time, it had been proven to be a rumor. It is learned that the new economic and financial plan of the Weng cabinet has been largely drafted after President Weng and the relevant heads discussed it in detail and consulted with the Quan Gan party's opinions. It can be submitted to the political affairs meeting for discussion and implementation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Yuan Siyan, the Nanjing-based representative of the Guangdong Provincial Government, denied to reporters the reports in the Jinghu newspapers that Chairman Song's visit to Nanjing this time was related to economic reform and 美援 issues. He said that Chairman Song's visit to Nanjing this time was purely to report his work to President Chiang.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] President Yu Hongjun of the National Bank came to Nanjing from Shanghai last week and, together with President Weng and others, drafted a new economic and financial reform plan. As there are still important official duties in Shanghai that need to be dealt with urgently, he is scheduled to return to Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] On the 8th, the Jing Evening News reported that the authorities would summon people from the Shanghai business community to Nanjing to discuss the new economic and financial plan. On the evening of the 8th, an authoritative person denied this and solemnly pointed out that there was no such thing. He also said that many of the measures in the new economic reform plan are related to the gains and losses of industry and commerce, so it is important to maintain strict secrecy in advance. How could it be possible to discuss it with people in the business community beforehand? The report in the evening paper is absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Former Premier Zhang Qun has been in Nanjing for two days and has been very busy meeting with various parties. He also visited the President for a long talk at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. Further news: Mr. Zhang's future position has not yet been finalized. He was previously consulted about the idea of serving as the chairman of the Presidential Palace's National Policy Advisory Committee, but Mr. Zhang has not yet responded. It is now reported that he will be appointed to a position in the soon-to-be-established 美援 Rural Reconstruction Committee. There is also a saying that Mr. Zhang will be appointed, but there is no concrete confirmation of either. Mr. Zhang has also considered going to Japan to meet with MacArthur, but the departure date has not been set.</p>
<h3>Overall Review of the Battle Situation in the Past Half Year (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>(6) Northeast Battle Situation The ambition of the Northeast Lin Biao bandits was to seize Changchun and Shenyang, two areas rich in politics and of strategic significance, in an attempt to realize the dream of Mao Zedong and Li Lisan's Asian Communist International Intelligence Bureau and the establishment of a pseudo-puppet organization. However, the National Army, by holding these two strategic strongholds, not only restrained the bandits' 500,000 elite troops, preventing them from moving freely, but also placed two time bombs, making international ambitious people hesitate. In addition to expanding the internal strife of the international fifth column of the Communist bandits, they never dared to learn the recklessness of the Japanese imperialists and swallow the Northeast in one bite. They struggled hard from last winter until now, only engaging in bandit-like harassment in the Rehe-Liaoning border area. However, the vast number of people in this area, who Mao Zedong, the bandit leader, called the "Liberation Army's" foundation, instead carried their young and supported their old in large numbers, trekking thousands of miles to embrace the motherland. So far, more than one million people have arrived in the Pingjin area alone, and the number of people who want to escape but cannot enter the pass is more than ten million. The hundreds of thousands of National Army troops in the Northeast remain steadfast and immovable, and the bandits can do nothing about it. This fact proves the shaking of the bandits' military foundation and the success of the National Army's strategic and political strategies.</p>
<p>(7) North China Battle Situation In the North China battlefield, the bandit troops under the direct command of bandit leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De, such as Nie Rongzhen, Li Yunchang, He Long, and Xu Xiangqian, have been painstakingly plotting for the past six months to destroy several key transportation routes, such as the Ping-Sui, Ping-Gu, Ping-Bao, and Bei-Ning Roads, and the Jinpu section, so that the political and economic situation in North China would fall into a state of paralysis, thus facilitating the bandits' roving occupation. However, every time the bandits stirred, they were hit by the National Army's mobile strikes. From the defeat on the Pingbao Line in January this year, to the frustration and return after harassing the Pingsui Road in March, to the invasion of Chengde in May, which was defeated by our internal and external attacks, followed by harassment of the Pinggu Road, where nearly half of its Third Column was annihilated by us in the Pinggu area; in June, Nie Rongzhen, Li Yunchang, and other bandits jointly harassed the outer areas of Qinhuangdao, planning to destroy the Jinyu section of the railway, but in Anshan, Shimen, Changli, and other places, more than 5,000 people were killed by us. Thanks to the National Army's protection and the road workers' courageous repairs, the railway traffic situation is now very good. The facts prove that Nie's plot to destroy our transportation in North China has been crushed. However, the most meaningful victory is not only this, but also the National Army's control outside this transportation line and the打击on Nie's military strength. The various battles in the Jinbei area, the Jidong area, the Rehe-Liaoning border area, and the Jicha area have proved that the bandits' policy of "occupying the surface" and "cutting off the lines" has begun to fail, and the loss of combat power, in particular, has exceeded Nie's expectations.</p>
<p>(8) Northwest Battle Situation In the Northwest, after Peng Dehuai's bandit troops suffered setbacks last winter and failed to attack Yulin three times this spring, they changed their route and fled south after Mao's replenishment. At first, they launched a sneak attack on Yichuan, which succeeded for a while, but then, because the National Army adopted a mobile strategy and abandoned strongholds of lost strategic value, Peng Dehuai's main bandit force, about four columns, went deep into the area alone and was attracted to the Jingwei Jin Valley, where two-thirds were eliminated. Since the great victory in Longdong in early May, a solid foundation has been laid for the Northwest Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. The remnants of Peng's columns had to retreat and lurk in the Huanglong Mountains for rest and reorganization, and they are still being searched and suppressed by our army. The bandits' dream of expanding their roving operations in the Northwest will not be realized.</p>
<p>(9) Central China Battle Situation The success of the sweeping campaign in the Dabie Mountains in Central China shattered Liu Bocheng's plan to establish a base for southward advancement. They had no choice but to flee in embarrassment to the Funiu Mountains and Tongbai Mountains and join forces with Chen Geng. In the middle, they also joined forces with Chen Yi and Kong Congzhou, and briefly stirred up trouble outside Nanyang, attacking the Wanxi militia. However, in addition to occupying the mountainous area of Xixiakou, more than 20,000 bandits outside Nanyang were wiped out by the National Army. In the recent Yudu Campaign, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and local communists Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, and other 200,000 bandits concentrated their forces to counterattack in the Yellow River flooded area. As a result, in nine days of bloody fighting, more than 80,000 were killed or wounded, while we only suffered losses from one division and one brigade. The bandits were pursued and suppressed by our joint army and air force as they fled, and suffered heavy casualties. On the banks of the Yellow River in western Shandong, our army seized enough weapons from the bandits to form a brigade. Although Chen Yi's failure this year was not as severe as last year's in Shandong, he cannot immediately restore his original combat strength. In order to cover up his defeat, the bandits launched a sneak attack on Xiangyang, succeeding by luck, but it has now been recovered by the National Army.</p>
<p>(10) East China Battle Situation In East China, Chen Yi left the Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns in northern Jiangsu. Since suffering heavy losses in the Yanfu area in early June, he once attempted to flee back to southern Shandong, but was blocked by the National Army in the A'hu and Xin'an areas. Only more than 1,000 people belonging to the Eleventh Column escaped back to southern Shandong. Although he has recently attempted to stir up trouble near Lianshui, Shuyang, and Suqian, since the implementation of total war in northern Jiangsu, the people and government forces have gradually become one, and there is strength to suppress bandits everywhere. The bandits' goal is to restrain and disperse our forces in many ways. However, as our people's self-defense forces become stronger and stronger, it will not be easy for the bandits to disperse the National Army's forces. As for central Shandong, although the bandits used the strength of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Columns to first stir up trouble in Changli and Weixian, and recently captured Yanzhou, they are currently reorganizing and resting, and it is rumored that they will attack Jinan recently. If the battle situation develops to this point, the bandits in that area will be unable to escape the fate of being attacked by us from inside and outside.</p>
<p>(11) Comparison of Battle Results In the past six months, due to the National Army's change of strategy, great achievements have been made in annihilating the main force of the bandit army. Although in terms of territory, we recovered 65 important military towns and voluntarily abandoned 89 that were invaded by the bandits, it seems that the bandits have made some progress. However, the recent victory in Yudu is the best harvest of our concentrated use of mobile forces, and has given a heavy blow to the "living forces" of the international fifth column in China. As for the comparison of casualties between bandits and us, the ratio in the first half of the year was about one to three. The total number of bandit casualties was 710,572 (excluding the casualties of the great battle in the Yellow River flooded area in early July), while our army's casualties were only 232,851. During the same period, 44,680 bandits were captured, and 52,071 of our officers and soldiers were missing. Also, from January to May (June is still being counted), the battle results of our army were: 33,263 rifles and machine guns, 812 light machine guns, 126 heavy machine guns, 184 submachine guns, 755 pistols, 17 mountain and field guns, 51,153 hand grenades, 4,288 rounds of various artillery shells, and 489,258 rounds of various rifle bullets. Despite the fact that the bandits are issuing exaggerated and false propaganda figures every day to cheer up the fifth column underground elements lurking in the National Army's area, the eyes of the people of China are bright, and they are urgently demanding that the government strengthen its forces to quell the chaos. The Chinese people were able to defeat the Japanese invasion in the past, and of course they are even more determined and persevering to defeat the Communist bandits, the fifth column of the newly emerging imperialist, who are more ferocious than the Japanese.

<h3>Restoring Government Credit First! - Prerequisites for New Economic Measures -</h3>
<p>The so-called "New Economic Measures Program" or "Economic Reform Program" has been rumored in recent days, sometimes saying it will be announced soon, and sometimes saying it may be postponed, and its content is even more varied. Recently, Song Ziwen, chairman of Guangdong Province, was summoned to fly from Guangzhou to Nanjing to consult with the president on this program. Yesterday afternoon, President Weng and others were meeting in Nanjing, which shows that no matter what the content of this program is or whether it has any novelty, it is probably something that exists.</p>
<p>To be honest, the recent economic situation is indeed causing President Weng of the current cabinet a great deal of trouble. Because on the one hand, the government is printing large amounts of currency and increasing its issuance, and on the other hand, it is selling materials and tightening credit, originally wanting to balance things out somewhat to avoid stimulating prices. However, materials cannot be recovered once they are sold, and the legal currency still has to be circulated after it is recovered; if credit is loose and excessive, prices will certainly rise, and if credit is tightened, prices will stop slightly but still rise. As a result, from the end of May to the end of July, in the space of two months, the official exchange rate of the US dollar increased by 9.3 times, the wholesale price of goods increased by 6.2 times, and the cost of living index increased by 4.5 times, setting a new record! Everyone cannot stand it, so they blame the current cabinet. The administrative authorities themselves cannot stand it either, so they have to formulate the so-called "New Economic Measures Program."</p>
<p>Although the rumors about this new economic policy have been rampant, the content is still unclear. Of course, we do not want to see the economic situation become more serious than it is now, nor do we want to recklessly criticize the future policies of the current cabinet, and even less do we want to imagine that the new policies cannot save the crisis. However, judging from the previous economic reforms, we feel that if the government authorities can still truly reflect and understand the way of governing, then before talking about all economic reforms and before boldly trying any new economic measures, they must first think about the issue of government credit. If the government still thinks that credit is not important, then even if any future reforms have good motives and intentions, and even if reforming the currency system may be an urgent need, under the premise of popular mistrust, I am afraid that they will still fall into a situation where one wrong move leads to complete failure. For the sake of the overall national situation, we really dare not refrain from saying a few honest words.</p>
<p>The two words "credit" are very difficult to build up but very easy to lose. Once lost, it is even more difficult to restore. This is true for individuals, families, and groups, and why is it not true for the government? We are repeating old things because we really feel sorry for the government! Before the War of Resistance, the government was quite capable of maintaining its credit. Even during the September 18th Incident, the government had "extraordinary" measures to reduce interest by half and postpone the repayment of principal on public bonds, but the people were motivated by hatred of the enemy and shared the same hatred, and everyone did not object but was happy to accept it. Fortunately, there were no more breaches of faith, so the credit of the National Government was maintained throughout, and the abolition of taels and the implementation of the legal currency policy were able to proceed unimpeded. When the War of Resistance was launched, the 500 million yuan Patriotic Public Bond was sold out without waiting for publicity. We should frankly admit that this is proof that the economic foundation of the War of Resistance was built on the government's credit. Subsequently, the government issued many public bonds and savings certificates in Chongqing, including US dollar public bonds and gold savings certificates, which were especially welcomed by the people. Unfortunately, the then administrative authority, President Song, did not know which narrow-minded wealth-gathering experts he was persuaded by, and also became "short-sighted," copying the old article of reducing interest by half from the September 18th Incident, repaying the principal and interest of the US dollar public bonds at the statutory exchange rate, and deducting 40% of the donation from the matured gold savings certificates. At the time, perhaps the advisers thought that it was a clever move and that the government could reduce an expenditure and save a sum of gold, but little did they know that the loss of credit is still affecting things today. Those wealth-gathering experts who offered advice should be ashamed!</p>
<p>The Chinese have always valued benevolence and charity, and it does not matter if they donate some money, especially in times of national crisis. However, they suffered a loss once and learned a lesson. After that, no matter how eloquently the government wants to solicit bonds from the people, the people will give the government a cold shoulder.</p>
<p>After the victory, the government knew that it could no longer issue public bonds casually, so it devoted all its efforts to selling gold and foreign exchange, thinking that the military situation could be successfully concluded within half a year to a year, and that it only needed to stabilize prices during this period. Of course, this was not necessarily a wrong view. Unfortunately, the government's military operations failed to end as scheduled, and its estimates were wrong. As a result, in less than a year, almost half of the gold was sold and the foreign exchange was almost sold out. This was not a policy mistake but an estimation error. The government did not lose credit in the two matters of selling gold and selling foreign exchange as it did in the past by deducting 40% of the gold for donations. However, it still cannot completely restore the people's trust in the government.</p>
<p>When the cabinet was reorganized and President Zhang took office, everyone thought that Zhang Gongquan, a financial expert, would once again pin his hopes on issuing public bonds. Since the US dollar was the most popular in the market, US dollar public bonds and US dollar treasury bills were issued side by side. Before the issuance, the president and vice president of the Central Bank would usually give a speech, and they seemed very sincere about maintaining the credit. The people also thought that the government might not lose credit again. Although they still maintained a wait-and-see attitude, they could not resist the repeated adjustments of the foreign exchange rate. Public bonds and treasury bills seemed to be profitable, and the government seemed to be able to keep its promises, so they were once again attracted. However, over time, the official foreign exchange rate became fixed, while the black market foreign exchange rate soared at the same time. The people were once again worried about how the principal and interest of the bonds would be settled. At the time, in order to absorb overseas remittances, encourage exports, and save the national treasury's figures for repaying the principal and interest of US dollar public bonds and treasury bills, the government invented a foreign exchange settlement certificate. Holders of public bonds and treasury bills said it was wrong. The bonds clearly stated that the principal and interest would be repaid according to the exchange rate listed by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee. If the listed price does not move, why should there be an extra demand? The technical skill is admirable, but in the eyes of the people, the government will inevitably lose credit once again on the bonds!</p>
<p>We want to solemnly inform President Weng that the best way for the government to contract the currency is to increase legitimate tax revenue and issue public bonds, but both of these depend on the credit of the government's responsible personnel. Other measures such as selling materials and stopping loans are not the most effective ways to contract the currency. There is no need to explain the reasons, just look at the facts of the past year. In addition to reorganizing tax revenue, the government's only legitimate way to absorb idle funds in the market is to issue public bonds. Under favorable conditions, the people are happy to buy public bonds and securities from a credible government. This is true in China, and it is true in foreign countries. This was true in the past, and it will be true in the future. Unfortunately, government officials are often deceived by the eloquent words of those who like to make small calculations, suffer from shortsightedness, and unknowingly lose the government's credit in front of the people, which makes it difficult to continue issuing public bonds. Moreover, officials and clerks in the self-proclaimed economic control agencies who do not understand the overall situation insist on creating a panic in the stock market, so that the people are hesitant to buy securities. This is not only greedy for small gains but losing big ones, it is simply wanting to close the door to issuing public bonds and cutting off one's own path to survival.</p>
<p>The establishment of a constitutional government is, according to the old Chinese saying, originally a great opportunity to deeply "blame oneself," "start anew with the people," and restore government credit. Unfortunately, although the high-ranking officials have all read ten thousand books, they seem to have forgotten the old saying "A people without trust cannot stand." In order to make up for the deficit, they want to come up with some novel new tricks regardless of the constitutional provisions that the people's lives and property should be protected. They are still unwilling to honestly do one or two things to restore the government's great trust and save things from the root. We are afraid that we will one day cause a greater disaster, but we sincerely hope that our words will not come true.</p>
<p>We also know very well that the highest authorities are concerned about the seriousness of the national financial and economic situation, and are diligently seeking advice, hoping that the government can have a refreshing measure to save the impending crisis. Not to mention the responsible government officials, even ordinary people are discussing on their own, wanting to make a contribution of a thousand thoughts from a fool. However, we still believe that the most fundamental prerequisite problem is restoring government credit is the first step. If credit is not taken into account, it is useless to merge banks and money shops, or order money shops to suspend business for a certain period of time, nationalize gold, inspect warehouses, and even forcibly open safe deposit boxes. All of these new tricks are unworkable and only obstacles that lose popular support. If you want to use these methods as preparation for reforming the currency system, that is even a bigger joke! Moreover, what is the use of arbitrarily changing the unit of currency before credit is restored? We dare to boldly say one sentence: If the government has credit, it can issue public bonds; if the government has credit, it can immediately stop increasing the issuance of currency; if the government has credit, it can open up sources of income and make up for the deficit in the national budget; if the government has credit, it can get the full support of the people and quell the bandits' rebellion as soon as possible. Everything, everything, starts with restoring credit. Do not regard it as an old saying! With the large population, vast land, rich resources, and friendly assistance of China, if the government has credit, how difficult is it to walk the path of self-reliance? Whether the government is really willing to take this bright and spacious road and not arbitrarily walk on side paths or demonic paths, we will predict it from its future actions.</p>
<h3>Huang Gongzong Director Chen Panling Talks About This Year's Most Tense Huang Flood - Hope That All Parties Will Assist In This Difficulty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaifeng, 8th] Huanghe River Repair and Prevention Project is most serious every flood season. The reporter interviewed Chen Panling, Director of Huanghe River Engineering Bureau, to understand this year's flood prevention situation. He said: Although Huang's flood is tense every year, it has never been as severe as this year. (1) Last year, the river water initially returned to its original course, and the flow was slow, resulting in silting up of the riverbed. This year the Yongwei increase is high. (2) Based on past experience, this year's river water should be larger than last year. Last year, the maximum flow did not exceed 15,000 cubic meters per second. (3) This year's flood prevention conditions are far inferior to last year's, because (A) The embankment from Quxingji in Henan Province to Dongzhuang section in western Shandong is fragile, and construction has not been able to start since last winter due to bandit disturbances. (B) During this bandit attack on Kaifeng, the materials and tools of this Bureau and the repair and prevention offices of Hebei and Henan provinces were almost completely lost. All the section team materials and equipment along the river from Yangqiao Dangerous Work in Henan Province to Dongzhuang Dangerous Work in Shandong Province were also looted. (C) This year's flood prevention fee was originally budgeted by this Bureau at 300 billion based on March prices. According to the current situation, it must be increased by at least ten times. Moreover, this Bureau and various repair and prevention offices have lost everything, and a huge amount of money is needed to replenish them. As of today, the central government has only successively allocated 50 billion yuan for repair and prevention fees, which is far from enough. (D) The major flood season has arrived in the past month, and rescue work has been repeatedly obstructed by bandits. On June 15, the war in western Shandong intensified, and employees were forced to withdraw. Eighteen employees and 232 laborers were captured en route. There have also been frequent casualties elsewhere. In short, this year's flood season has arrived, and the river water is gradually increasing, with a flow rate of 6,000+ cubic meters per second. I hope that all parties will give full assistance in order to get through this difficult time.</p>

<h3>Soviet Firmly Opposes Extending Danube River Convention; British Request for International Arbitration Rejected</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, August 7th] The Danube River Conference today rejected by a vote of seven to three the British proposal to ask the International Court of Justice in The Hague or the United Nations Secretariat to arbitrate whether the 1921 Danube River Convention should be extended. Britain, the United States, and France voted in favor, while Eastern European countries voted against. During the debate, US Representative Cannon strongly argued that the US draft would better guarantee freedom of navigation on the Danube than the Soviet draft. After Britain's request for arbitration by The Hague or the United Nations was proposed, the US and French representatives strongly supported it. The French representative even said that if the conference rejected arbitration, France would refuse to accept the conference's decision. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky strongly argued that there was no legal issue that needed arbitration. He flatly refused to consider the 1921 convention and emphasized that "the Four Powers Conference of 1946 has given the current Danube River Conference full powers to draft a new convention, and its qualifications are beyond doubt." The conference also rejected the French proposal to open the conference to reporters by a vote of seven to three, but passed a resolution allowing each delegation to freely report on the progress of the conference to reporters.</p>
<h3>Four Powers to Continue Talks to Resolve German Problem; West German People Deeply Fear Becoming "Munich Second"</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, August 7th] Well-informed sources say that if the talks currently being conducted in Moscow by the special envoys of the three Western powers and the Soviet Union reach an agreement, the matters to be carried out by both sides thereafter will be roughly as follows: (1) The Berlin dispute will be resolved on the spot through negotiations by the Allied commanders-in-chief in Germany; (2) A Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in Paris in September, simultaneously with the UN General Assembly; (3) This conference will be thoroughly prepared to avoid the stalemates of previous conferences; (4) Sources here believe that the chance of success depends less on initial concessions than on the willingness of both sides to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The same sources predict that neither the three Western powers nor the Soviet Union is willing to show any trump cards before the conference is held. For example, even if the original state of Berlin is restored, the three powers will still not allow the Soviet Union to participate in the control of the Ruhr. Similarly, the Soviet Union will not allow the three Western powers to inspect the Soviet occupation zone. Although a general agreement on the German problem is difficult to reach for the time being, these well-informed sources point out that even if smaller points can be agreed upon in an atmosphere of mutual goodwill, mutual trust can be restored, which is necessary to overcome current difficulties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, August 7th] The German Telegraphic News, which is permitted to be published in the British sector, warned in an editorial today that the Moscow conference will become a "Munich Conference Second." The editorial stated that the meetings currently being held in Moscow make us fear that they will become a continuation of the Munich Conference, but this phenomenon must be avoided, because this path will make it impossible to solve the German problem. Although the Soviet Union is slightly stalemated in Berlin, if the Western Allies make concessions to the Soviet Union in its many advantages in various regions without careful consideration in advance, the position of the Western Allies will be destroyed as a result.</p>
<h3>American Business Weekly Article Estimates Soviet Strength</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, August 8th] American Business Weekly published an article estimating the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union. Its conclusion is that the economic impact of the Soviet Union in the event of a Third World War would be "to return millions of Soviets to a barbaric and starving existence." The magazine believes that the sacrifices that another war would impose on the Soviet people would be unimaginable to the average American. The following statistics are just a few examples: (1) Housing Problem: The Soviet Union had 25 million homes destroyed by the Germans during World War II, but its construction industry has been slow to develop, because factories and offices have priority access to building materials, even the families of Soviet industry personnel cannot find a large room in public housing.</p>
<p>(2) Low Production of Consumer Goods: According to several successive Five-Year Plans in the Soviet Union, the focus is on expanding the automotive industry, and its consumer goods industry has been greatly affected. At the end of World War II, Soviet heavy industry was close to pre-war levels, but the living standards of the Soviet people were lower than 20 years ago, so they were very afraid of another war. All of this proves that the primary goal of the Soviet Union is to build a war industry that is equal to the United States, regardless of the losses suffered by the people. If a third world war occurs, the Soviet Union will exhaust the manpower and material resources of the Eurasian continent under its control for its heavy industry needs. The Soviet leaders, who have unhesitatingly caused millions of peasants to cry out and suffer from the cold while carrying out agricultural reforms for 30 years, will still not hesitate to starve millions of people in Europe and its own country if they believe it will contribute to their war victory. Therefore, the magazine stated that we can predict the future situation, that is, the people of Europe and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly enter a new dark age of terror.</p>
<h3>US Congress Adjourns After Passing Three Bills</h3>
<p>Most of Truman's Proposals Rejected</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, August 7th] The special session of Congress adjourned today after completing action on the mildly tempered inflation control bill and the revised housing measures. This special meeting was convened by President Truman in a declaration at the Democratic National Convention to take action on its eighteen-bell emergency legislative program. But the only proposal fully passed by Congress was a bill appropriating $65 million to lend to the United Nations to build its headquarters. Republican senators defeated Democratic efforts to incorporate Truman's wage and price control proposals into their inflation control bill. The House also rejected a provision in the bill to increase the reserve requirements of Federal Reserve banks. The Senate also changed the percentage by which bank reserve requirements would be increased. In order to allow Congress to adjourn quickly, the House has passed the Senate's amendments. The limited inflation control passed by Congress restores wartime regulations on installment purchases and provides for a 4 percent increase in the reserve requirements for bank demand deposits and a 1.5 percent increase in the reserve requirements for time deposits. The House also passed the Senate-approved housing bill, but it did not include Truman's urging to build low-cost public housing and eliminate slums. This bill has been sent to the White House along with the inflation control bill for the President to sign. In addition to passing the above three bills, Congress also appropriated funds to make up for the shortfalls of the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration. Republican lawmakers largely despised Truman and rejected almost all of his proposals. However, there were also many members who wanted Congress to take more effective action on high prices and housing problems. Although Truman can reconvene Congress, it is highly questionable whether he will do so. Truman has now submitted his emergency plan to Congress and will intensify his attacks on Congress to pursue his election campaign. Democratic National Committee Chairman McGlak said that since the Republican-controlled Congress did not pass an effective plan to curb inflation at the special session, the American people could elect Truman in November and elect a Democratic-led Congress that would not be threatened by rising prices again.</p>
<h3>French Financial Plan: Parliament Begins Debate</h3>
<p>Finance Committee Has Already Revised and Passed It</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Basel, 7th] French Finance Minister René Pleven recently told the National Assembly that from now until the end of this year and the national budget for next year, there will be a deficit of tens of billions of francs. Pleven's remarks are generally regarded as a bitter pill offered to the parliament. Various political groups thoroughly reviewed Pleven's financial plan overnight. The Socialist Party may accept this plan under the pretext of seeking freedom for France, as this plan would prevent the resurgence of the Gaullist faction. Some members of the Popular Republican Movement will refuse to vote in favor of this plan with their party members. Communist members are particularly vehemently opposed to this plan. It is widely believed that the parliament will begin debate this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The Finance Committee of the French National Assembly today passed many provisions of the financial and economic bill requesting special powers from Finance Minister René Pleven, but with significant amendments. The committee refused to grant the government the power to modify tax burdens and fixed rates. Pleven is prepared to accept the committee's desired changes to the wording, as requesting a vote of confidence or retaining all essential points of the original text would endanger the government's existence. At the same time, left-wing groups have joined yesterday's protest by the Communist Party, denouncing Pleven's plan as unconstitutional.</p>
<h3>West Berlin Gas and Electricity Supply Further Reduced</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 7th] The British, American, and French occupying forces commanders ordered on the 7th to further reduce the gas and electricity supply to West Berlin by 50%, which will reduce the coal used for gas supply in Berlin to 1,300 tons per day. The electricity needed for daily cooking will be reduced by half, and household gas will be completely stopped from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM every day. This restriction is even stricter than wartime levels, but the suffering of Berlin residents is not limited to this. The Soviet puppet administrators admitted that the food supply in the Soviet occupation zone is deteriorating. The food riots that were a cause for concern earlier this week have been suppressed, but only after the Soviets sent several truckloads of grain to the main trouble spots. German officials in the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin told the Berlin press that it would take another five to six weeks before all food ration cards could be fully implemented. At the same time, in order to ease the confusion of the two currencies in Berlin, Western countries are preparing to airlift 25 million West Marks to Berlin, and will first distribute 100 Marks of new salary to each factory employee, as the factories have been in arrears for two weeks.</p>
<h3>Italian General Confederation of Labor Splits</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 7th] The Italian Communist Party on the 7th accused the powerful Catholic Action organization of supporting anti-communist unions to secede from the General Confederation of Labor and spreading religious intolerance. The left-wing controlled Labor Confederation formally dismissed all Christian Democratic union leaders on the evening of the 6th, splitting the labor organization into pro-communist and anti-communist groups. The Communist Party's organ, "Unità," editorialized, accusing Catholic Action of "spreading discord and chaos" with the aim of strengthening the Church's power and its organization within the classes. The article was signed by D'Annini, who formerly served as ambassador to Moscow and was dismissed by the government for leaving his post without permission in March to return to Italy to engage in Communist Party election campaigns.</p>
<h3>Lie Submits United Nations Budget to General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie submitted a budget proposal of $33,469,587 for the United Nations next year, $1,355,608 less than this year's budget ($34,825,195). Lie's proposal is outlined in his budget report submitted to the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in Basel.</p>
<h3>One of the Preludes to the US General Election: The Birth of the Fourth Party</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>New York Airmail: The split within the Democratic Party will undoubtedly create a sure victory for the Republican Party in November. Today, any politically savvy observer believes that Dewey will be the master of the White House next year, without a doubt. During the Third Party convention in Philadelphia, Wallace's campaign manager, Paul Baldwin, said: "Truman is a complete idiot; he completely betrayed Roosevelt's consistent policies." Baldwin also said: "President Roosevelt sincerely said two weeks before his death that the Democratic Party needs Wallace, especially in today (1945) in this extraordinary situation!"</p>
<p>But "unfortunately," Wallace was not the Vice President in 1945. By some mischance, today's major split in the Democratic Party was created. Baldwin said: "The split will undoubtedly lead to Dewey's victory, but we (referring to the Third Party) must raise this banner. The Third Party's opportunity is in 1952 or 1956!"</p>
<p>Will the United States need Wallace by then? At least for now, this question cannot be answered. Originally, the split of the Democratic Party did not begin today. In my correspondence to this newspaper in 1946, I repeatedly mentioned the separation of the left and right wings of the Democratic Party. At that time, Wallace was still the dignified Secretary of Commerce, and Labor Secretary Schlenbach had not yet passed away. Two years later, the Democratic Party did not expect to turn into such a major divided situation. In addition to Wallace's Third Party (Progressive Party), there is also a Fourth Party (Jefferson Democratic Party). The Democratic Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates total six: Truman and Barkley as a group, Wallace and Taylor as a group, and Hammond and Launt as another group.</p>
<p>Thurmond is the governor of South Carolina, and Wright is the governor of Mississippi. They are both typical Southerners. They represent the interests of the American South. Most of their proposals are still the proposals of the South during the American Civil War era. When the Democratic Party National Convention was held in Philadelphia on July 12, the official declaration of the Democratic Party put forward the platform and policies for the election. Truman and the leaders of several northern states decided on a chapter called "National Basic Rights": (1) The Democratic Party firmly advocates the abolition of "lynching"; (2) Opposition to unreasonable poll taxes; (3) Opposition to racial discrimination; (4) Equal national employment opportunities. These items were strongly opposed by representatives from several southern states. Dixon, the former governor of Alabama, proposed an amendment, advocating the removal of these mandatory provisions, respecting the local powers of each state, raising the powers of state governments and state legislatures, and handling matters separately in accordance with local conditions in various places. Alabama's amendment was rejected in the convention by a vote of 925 to 309, causing fury and resentment among the southern representatives. When Pennsylvania Senator Myers read the convention declaration, representatives from Mississippi first left the venue, and representatives from Alabama and other six southern states followed, staging a tragic second split in the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Historically, the American Democratic Party originated in the South, and the South is the Democratic Party's old base. When the Fourth Party, the Jefferson Democratic Party's National Convention, was held in Birmingham, Alabama, a big businessman from Birmingham, Mr. Standard said: "The Southern Democrats are very angry at the strong and domineering occupation by the Northern representatives. Southern party members believe that the son is kicking out the mother." In Chinese, it's like "forgetting one's ancestors." These are just the intuitive thoughts of the three businessmen. I think what Dixon (former governor of Alabama) said at the convention was very concrete. He said: The northern Democrats do not understand the special environment of the several southern states. They are raping the public will of the southern people, preparing to create a social revolution in the South. This revolution will inevitably lead to bloodshed and chaos, and will destroy the stability of southern society.</p>
<p>He also said: The southerners do not not respect human rights. Regarding racial equality, religious freedom, etc., there are few explicit provisions in the American Constitution. The southern people have always adhered to the Constitution. Why should Truman "go to the trouble?" Then, Mississippi Governor Wright called on all men and women who advocate upholding the autonomy rights of the states and who oppose Truman to gather under the banner of the Birmingham convention!"</p>
<p>The banner of the "Confederacy" from the Civil War era flew in Birmingham. In the past eighty years, the United States has made progress in various aspects, but this "black problem" will always become a hidden danger for the country. The black problem caused racial discrimination, which affected the legislation of various states, and was linked to the debate between "federal centralization" and "confederate system," which is why there was the "Civil War" during the Lincoln era. Unexpectedly, eighty years after the end of the Civil War, a huge portrait of General Lee, a hero of the Civil War, appeared on the streets of Birmingham again.</p>
<p>The Birmingham convention also elected presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Originally, it was planned to elect Arkansas Governor Laney, a famous tough guy and a typical "southern type," as the presidential candidate. His "not giving face" to President Truman won a lot of cheers from the southerners. However, later, due to differences of opinion, Laney was unwilling to be nominated as the presidential candidate, and it was temporarily decided to change the nomination to Thurmond and Wright.</p>
<p>The Fourth Party expects to win all the southern votes in the November election, and some even believe that it can win the votes of the Midwest, such as Oklahoma, Indiana, and even President Truman's hometown of Missouri. However, some people also think that we should not be too optimistic. Alabama Democratic Party Chairman McCoy Fan advocated at the convention that Southerners should not show their shame. He believes that to elect a prestigious person like Eisenhower as the presidential candidate of the Fourth Party can win the victory in November. He believes that we should never nominate people from our own small circle, because we cannot win a national victory. McCoy Fan's opinion was not accepted by the convention.</p>
<p>There are also southern people who fundamentally oppose the "rebellion meeting" in Birmingham. Georgia Senator Russell is one of the most powerful ones. Russell received 263 votes in the presidential candidate vote at the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia, a highly respected political figure in the South. He opposed the split of the party, saying, "I oppose Truman, and I will oppose him in the Senate seat. I will not participate in the traitor meeting!"</p>
<p>When Truman returned to the White House triumphantly from Philadelphia and announced the news of convening a special session of Congress, reporters found Russell, who said humorously: "Another unfortunate event for the Democratic Party!"</p>

<h3>Chairman of US Espionage Case Investigation Committee Accuses Truman of Blocking Information, Will File Charges and Ask President to Explain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Senator Ferguson, chairman of the Senate committee investigating the government's "loyalty" program, claimed today that he will accuse President Truman of intolerable presidential arrogance for refusing to provide important information to Congress. Truman refused to provide the investigating committee with loyalty information about Remington, a former official of the wartime Production Board, who has been accused of being a member of a Soviet spy network.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Senator Ferguson stated in a speech in the Senate on the 7th that Congress is being forced into an intolerable position, either blindly passing legislation or forcing the President to explain his actions in the Communist case investigation. Ferguson accused Truman of refusing this week to hand over to congressional investigators the records of the loyalty investigation of federal government employees who are currently involved in the Communist espionage case. Ferguson spoke in his capacity as chairman of the Senate investigation committee. Ferguson's remarks may be the most severe attack on the President since he took office in April 1945. He stated that Congress must come to a showdown with Truman, as the President's arrogance has reached an intolerable level. It is reported that Truman said on the 5th that Ferguson's investigation committee's review of the espionage case and the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearing of Communist statements are aimed at making people forget that Congress refused to pass his anti-inflation proposals and other proposals. Truman resolutely refused to give any federal government employees' loyalty investigation records to the two committees. Ferguson accused the President and his administration of attempting to conceal their mistakes. He also stated that Congress had allocated 11 million US dollars to complete the government employee loyalty investigation record plan, so it has the right to know how this matter is progressing. Ferguson further stated that the relationship between the President and Congress has reached a tense limit due to secrecy.</p>
<p>New "Mysterious Witness" Reports Today</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] The House subcommittee responsible for investigating a Communist spy group that infiltrated the federal government during the war subpoenaed Brotman, a former leader of the American Communist Party who recently requested to rejoin the Communist Party National Convention but was rejected, on the 7th, but he is not the "mysterious witness" in the investigators' mouths. According to official sources, this "mysterious witness" will be Golyeor, a former communist who will publicly report the whole story in Washington on the 9th.</p>
<p>Madder, the acting chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, said: The subcommittee has arrived here specifically to question Golyeor. Later, he also said: A certain Soviet female teacher will be absent from the inquiry. She is currently at the center of a debate between the Soviet Consulate and an anti-Soviet group over the issue of being "kidnapped." Golyeor was secretly questioned by the subcommittee in the Federal Building on the evening of the 6th. Congressman Nixon said: "She is the most important of any witness we have subpoenaed." Madder had also previously stated in Washington that this mysterious witness "will be able to provide the committee with valuable and direct information. Regarding a person who has been in contact with a Communist spy group, this Communist spy group is also able to meet with the core Communist figures. We have reason to believe that this person is working inside the spy group and is also the only person who can contact the inside of the spy group. As for whether this person is still working in the government, I cannot say."</p>
<p>Soviet Female Teacher Kidnapped, Case Extremely Bizarre</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] New York Soviet Consul General Lomokin hid a Soviet female teacher in the consulate on the 7th, and claimed that he had rescued her from the White Russian kidnappers who forced her to confess. However, the leader of the congressional spy investigation immediately stated that she was the key witness they had been searching for for many days. Lomokin claimed that the female teacher was kidnapped in New York on July 31, when she was preparing to leave for the Soviet Union. Lomokin claimed that he rescued her on the 7th from a farm 75 miles away. The woman's name is Gorsonkina, who previously taught the children of Soviet diplomats in New York. Lomokin also condemned Leo Tolstoy, the daughter of the great Soviet writer Tolstoy, for assisting in the kidnapping. He claimed that another Soviet teacher and his wife and children are still being held by "White Russian bandits" in New Jersey. However, Miss Leo Tolstoy said that Gorsonkina went to the Tolstoy farm voluntarily. She was afraid of being murdered by Soviet officials, like her husband. "She was very happy when she stayed on the farm," but when she saw the consul's car coming, she started to tremble and said, "She will find a way to come back." Miss Tolstoy also strongly condemned Lomokin's statement as "a bunch of nonsense." Mrs. Gorsonkina appeared at a press conference held at Lomokin's consulate on the 7th. She said: "The food provided and the treatment received were good when she stayed on the farm, but she was forced to work in the kitchen."</p>
<h3>Poland and Czechoslovakia Promote Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Resolution Passed at Warsaw Conference</p>
<p>[TASS, Warsaw, 7th] The Polish-Czech Economic Cooperation Conference was held in Warsaw from the 4th to the 6th of this month.

<h3>Israel Seeks Peace, Possibly Exploratory in Nature</h3>
<p>Arab League's Reply May Be Pessimistic</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rhodes, 7th] Israel's proposal to start peace talks was delivered to the Arab countries by UN mediator Bernadotte yesterday afternoon. According to people close to Bernadotte, the Arab response may be pessimistic. Some observers here suspect that the so-called peace talk proposal is essentially a means of testing the Arab attitude, as if the Arab countries accept the peace talks proposed by Israel, it will be tantamount to recognizing the State of Israel "in fact," and the Arab League has so far refused to consider recognizing Israel. People close to Bernadotte believe that even if the Arab countries accept the proposal for peace talks, the peace talks will inevitably be fruitless. Although Bernadotte expressed optimism about his mission, believing that a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue can eventually be found, some people close to Bernadotte are quite doubtful about the possibility of war not reigniting.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Ashida Still Emphasizes the Middle Road</h3>
<p>Believes That Left and Right Leanings Are Both Detrimental to Japan</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Ashida, Kurisu, and others, who were traveling in the northeastern regions, met with local reporters at Odate Station yesterday morning and said: "Currently, Japan's political situation is that on the one hand, the extremely left-wing tendency is very dangerous, and at the same time, the extremely right-wing tendency is also quite strong. Both of these will hinder Japan's future, so the advocacy of middle-of-the-road politics is very necessary. In the future, those who will take on this political responsibility will be the Central League or the Central Party. After returning to Tokyo, I will immediately engage in this political organization of the Central League that adopts the middle road."</p>
<h3>Laurent Will Succeed King as Prime Minister of Canada</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 7th] Canadian Undersecretary of State for External Affairs Laurent was elected Chairman of the Liberal Party by the Liberal Party Congress today, receiving 848 votes. According to Canadian tradition, the leader of the majority party will be elected as Prime Minister, so Laurent will now be the Chairman of the Liberal Party and will succeed King as Prime Minister. This congress was convened specifically at King's request, because King has been in office for 21 years and intends to resign before Parliament reconvenes in January next year. Laurent is 66 years old this year. He entered politics in 1941 and advocates close military cooperation between Canada and the United States, and Canada's participation in any collective security convention to link the United States and Western European countries.</p>

<h3>Malayan Government Warrants Dayak Rebel Leaders</h3>
<p>Viet Minh Troops Attack French Forces Twice</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 7th] Malayan Regional Officer General Boler said today that he is now considering moving the Dayak people of Borneo to the Malayan Federation to assist in the suppression of rebels in the area. These Dayaks were a large part of the personnel who formed the anti-Japanese movement in Borneo. The authorities here are now offering a reward for the arrest of more than 25 of the rebel leaders. Boler also declared that the rebels first attempted to establish a communist republic in the mountainous area of ​​Mount Gelian in southern Kelantan and other places, but failed due to excessive losses. Boler said that the current purpose of the suppression operation is to eliminate the banditry in this area and re-establish the authority of the authorities. (This area is where the Communist Party hopes to establish its first republic.) Mount Gelian and Plai are now under government control, and troops have also entered Plai. All suppression operations have encountered strong resistance from the enemy. (Plai is the second territory the rebels want to occupy in Malaya. Their first territory is Kayanger in southern Kelantan, where enemy leader Lowry was killed.) Boler concluded: Mortars were also used in the initial battle to annihilate the enemy in southern Kelantan.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union is Vigorously Establishing a Vast War Machine; Heavy Industry Center Moves to Siberia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, August 8th] The current issue of Life magazine published this week features a special report on the Soviet economy and military strength, based on previously released data. The information is the result of several months of diligent investigation by experts, or revealed by sources who cannot be directly identified. The conclusion of Life magazine's report is that the Soviet Union is establishing a vast organization dedicated to war. The center for the construction of Soviet heavy industry has gradually shifted to Siberia. The report also states that the Soviet Union is planning large-scale industrial facilities north of Lake Baikal and near the Pacific coast. If the Soviet Union completes its Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1950, it can still wage war centered in Siberia, even if it loses its western territories. The Soviet Union is currently building large-scale ironworks north of Lake Baikal, where coal is abundant and pig iron is of high quality. The Soviet Union is also establishing industrial facilities near Alma-Ata, adjacent to Xinjiang, China, to mine uranium. At the same time, new industrial facilities have also been established north of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The crucial significance of Soviet development of Siberia is to make it an industrial fortress that can supply the needs of a massive army and is difficult to bomb. Regarding the Soviet Union's military strength, Life magazine believes that even without the atomic bomb, its military power is considerable. In terms of its army, the Soviet Union possesses the world's largest standing army; in terms of its air force, it has 14,000 aircraft; its navy is currently planning to expand its submarine fleet. The Soviet Union's production volume in heavy industry has now reached or exceeded its 1940 level.</p>
<h3>The British "Trades Union Congress"</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in England, Ben Geng</p>
<p>The Labour Party is in power in Britain today, and the Labour Party has two organizations as its cornerstones. One is the Fabian Society; (Fabian Society) which has already been briefly introduced, and the other is the "Trades Union Congress." This is what I intend to briefly describe in this article.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Britain is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, so not only does the "working class movement" have a long history, but so does the trade union organization. However, as for the origin of the current "Trades Union Congress," the first "Trades Union Congress" was the Congress held in Manchester in 1866. A total of thirty-four delegates attended this meeting, representing 118,367 workers. In 1869, the Trades Union Congress discussed the issue of labor representatives in Parliament and organized a committee to implement the Congress's resolutions. Since then, the Trades Union Congress has continued to discuss issues related to social legislation. In 1886, a Labor Election Committee was organized, but this committee was influenced by "Liberal" elements. In 1890, the Trades Union Congress passed a resolution in favor of the "Eight-Hour Workday Bill," and it could perhaps be said that from this time on, it began to abandon economic individualism and move towards socialism. The aforementioned Labor Election Committee ceased its activities in 1893. In 1899, a resolution was passed to engage in socialist organization, which resulted in the creation of the "Labour Representation Committee" and the founding of the Labour Party the following year.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The Labour Party is a political organization, while the Trades Union Congress, although also containing a political element, should be considered a professional organization. Although the emergence of the Labour Party relied on the Trades Union Congress, the two are not the same thing, but the relationship between the two is very close. The Labour Party was formed in 1900, and since 1905, there has been a joint committee, jointly organized by the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the then "Trades Union Alliance" (this alliance was also supported by the Trades Union Congress). In 1914, the Trades Union Congress decided to reorganize this institution. In 1919, the Trades Union Congress passed a plan, deciding on the one hand to expand its internal executive body, and on the other hand to decide on a method for joint organization with the Labour Party. In 1920 and 1921, the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party Congresses both accepted the joint approach one after another, establishing a joint organization consisting of personnel sent by both sides. Therefore, the relationship between the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party can perhaps be said to be a horizontal relationship rather than a vertical relationship.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The Trades Union Congress has held a total of seventy-nine congresses from 1868 to 1947, and the number of workers it represents has been constantly increasing. In 1868, it was 28,367 people, in 1900 it was 1,200,000 people, in 1928 it was 3,874,842 people, and in 1945 it was 6,575,654 people. At the 79th Congress in 1947, there were 837 delegates, representing 187 trade unions in 18 major categories, and 7,540,397 workers. (The figures in this paragraph are based on the 79th report of the Trades Union Congress) With so many workers, its strength is naturally considerable.</p>
<p>In addition, we have seen that the total number of Labour Party members and the number of trade union workers participating in the Labour Party have been increasing year by year, and we can say with certainty that not only is there a close connection between the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, but also, due to the large number of trade union members participating in the Labour Party and the high percentage of total Labour Party members they represent, one can imagine what kind of relationship the two have. Last year, the number of Labour Party members set a new record, but we should note that compared to the number of members in 1946, the number of members in 1947 (4,685,659 people) increased by 1,363,3018, but the number of trade union members participating in the Labour Party increased by 1,396,088 people. In other words, the number of ordinary party members decreased, which shows where the foundation of the Labour Party lies. It is no wonder that many policies of the Labour government must have the consent of the Trades Union Congress. Some people think that the Labour Party is an organization of intellectuals because the Fabian Society has many intellectuals, but after seeing this number, one can understand. This also gives some enlightenment to those who are interested in politics: any political party that wants to develop and wants to govern certainly needs intellectuals, but even more important is the common people. The total population of Britain, including men, women, old and young, is only between 45 million and 50 million, and more than 4.6 million is about one-tenth of the total number, but what we should understand is that the quality represented by this one-tenth is very important. If children are excluded, then the proportion it occupies is naturally more than one-tenth. If such a political party is led properly, it should have a future. (Sent from London on June 5)</p>

<h3>Tragic Accident in Baoshan Road During Thunderstorm: 90 Casualties at Yongbei Factory; Workers Unable to Escape Electrocution and Fire</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at 3:20 PM, amidst heavy rain and thunder, a tragic accident occurred at the Yongbei Underwear Factory, No. 393 Baoshan Road, Zhabei, involving electrocution and fire caused by a lightning strike, resulting in as many as 90 casualties, accounting for more than 80% of the factory's employees, which is truly shocking.</p>
<p>The Yongbei Factory building has a total of five floors, with a relatively solid structure, and has been newly repaired, but the factory has no lightning protection equipment. Yesterday's tragedy originated in the sewing room on the second floor of the factory. The sewing room usually has 53 male workers, divided into four tables, with four electric irons installed. There are also two electric motors nearby, which consume the most electricity in the factory. At 3:20 PM, heavy rain poured down, and lightning struck. The entire power line was suddenly hit by lightning and fire, and it burned fiercely. All the workers were unable to escape and were burned, crying out for help. The noise was heard outside. At the time, there were also 11 female workers sewing buttons on the third floor, and more than 10 male workers were scraping paste. The fourth floor was the sorting room, with more than 20 male workers. The fifth floor was a dormitory. The power line also spread to the third and fourth floors, and the male and female workers on the third and fourth floors were unable to get downstairs and jumped from the windows to the road, resulting in many injuries from falls.</p>
<p>Across the road from the factory was a police station. At the sound of thunder, the stationed police suddenly saw a flash of fire on the second floor and heard screams. Knowing that a fire had occurred, they urgently reported to the Shanghai North District Fire Brigade and the Fire Department. Within a few minutes, the Shanghai North Fire Brigade dispatched eight fire trucks and one ambulance, and the Fire Department headquarters dispatched four pump trucks, two ladder trucks, and three ambulances. After arriving at the scene, they used water to extinguish the fire and sent the male and female workers who jumped from the building to the Municipal Fourth Hospital, Municipal Fifth Hospital, and Gongji Hospital for emergency treatment. The fire was completely extinguished at 4:55 PM. Except for the sewing tables and most of the underwear raw materials on the second floor being destroyed, the bottom floor and the third and fourth floors did not suffer much damage, and the loss to the fifth-floor dormitory was also very slight.</p>
<p>After investigation, it was found that 46 people were killed on the spot by the lightning strike and electrocution, 10 people died after being injured and sent to the hospital, 10 people were hospitalized for treatment, and 24 people were discharged after being bandaged, for a total of 90 casualties. The factory owner, Cai Hongsheng, and five of his family members were also burned when they fled in panic when the fire broke out and are now residing in the Municipal Fifth Hospital.</p>
<p>Fortunately, It Didn't Reach the Bottom Floor</p>
<p>According to Zhou Mingyang, a male worker who narrowly escaped from the factory, he was working in the flat car room on the third floor when the fire broke out. In panic, he jumped out of the window with the crowd. He only suffered minor head injuries when he fell to the ground. He said that there were a total of 104 workers in the factory, including 11 female workers. The factory owner and his family lived in the factory. Fortunately, the rescue was swift, and the fire did not spread to the pulping room on the bottom floor, because it stored raw materials for making scientific soft collars, such as celluloid, acetone, and more. If an explosion had occurred, the consequences would have been even more unimaginable, and he was still frightened as he spoke.</p>
<h3>Names of the Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>The injured, in addition to the factory owner Cai Hongsheng, his wife Dai, and Dai's sister-in-law and four others, include the following male workers: Xie Genyao, Hu Hao, Yu Cunhua, Yang Shangda, Du Songnian, Zai Changlin, Wu Zuozhang, Chen Guotai, Dai Gengsheng, Wang Ruixiang, Ma Gongqing, Gao Ruliang, Cao Xikang, Xie Zukang, Shen Shengzheng, Tang Zhilin, Wang Naiming, Zhang Fulin, Chen Yonglin, Fu Anan, Pan Yongfa, Liu Wenlin, Mao Qian, and Pan Yuntai; and female workers: Wu Aixiang, Zai Shixian, Sun Aibao, Liu Guiying, and Chen Gongfen, totaling 34 people. The bodies of the 56 dead were sent to the Changde Road morgue for examination yesterday. The names of those who have been identified include: Li Jingen, Liu Jinyan, Gao Yugu (female), Dai Longshi (the factory owner's mother-in-law), Shen Guofu, Yu Youfu, Zhang Ruilin, and Chen Qinxin, totaling 18 people.</p>

<h3>Launching a Fundraising Campaign for Aid to China's Reconstruction and Revival</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, previously donated all the shares of the China Construction Bank to the party and also donated a portion of his ancestral property to the country. Recently, he joined former Philippine Governor-General Paul Vories McNutt and Life magazine publisher Henry Luce to launch a fundraising campaign for aid to China's reconstruction and revival. The method is similar to the "One Bowl of Rice Movement" during the Anti-Japanese War, with a general association in New York; there are branches in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. High-ranking US government officials and important figures from the Republican Party have automatically joined as committee members.</p>
<h3>Trial of Yasuji Okamura to be Scheduled Within a Day or Two</h3>
<p>General Yasuji Okamura, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, has been indicted by the prosecutor of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on charges of war crimes. Yesterday, according to the president of the court, Shi Meiyu, the date of Okamura's public trial will be decided within a day or two. The Military Tribunal is scheduled to conclude by the end of September, and the public trial of this case will be one of the most spectacular scenes before the court's conclusion.</p>
<h3>Two China Airlines Planes Complete Mission to Fly Medicines to Kaifeng</h3>
<p>After the recent battle of Kaifeng, there were many military and civilian casualties, and there was an urgent need for relief medicines. The Henan Provincial Government recently received a batch of urgently needed medicines from the Ministry of Health. Due to the urgency of time, they requested that China Airlines dispatch two aircraft to fly from Shanghai to Kaifeng. China Airlines has no radio station or air station in Kaifeng, and July 7 was also a day of heavy rain in central Henan. However, in view of the urgency of the batch of medicines for relief, it was finally decided to dispatch two aircraft to fly to transport them. They arrived safely the day before yesterday afternoon, completed the mission, and flew back to Shanghai late the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Father's Day Fundraising Reaches Target; People Eagerly Contribute, Raising 10 Billion for Student Aid</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth Father's Day. The Shanghai Father's Day Promotion Committee held a simple commemorative ceremony at 10:00 AM at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, inviting famous opera singers and celebrities to participate in the broadcast to launch a fundraising campaign for scholarships for needy students. More than 100 people from all walks of life attended. Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating that commemorating Father's Day is to promote filial piety. During this time of Communist rebellion, we should especially be loyal to the country and save the national crisis. Li Ximou and Tan Yimin then gave speeches one after another. A children's singing broadcast then began, with more than 50 singers from the Six District Center, the Eleven District Center, Fuchun, the Women's Normal School Attached Elementary School, and Zhaofeng Elementary School participating. In the afternoon, famous opera singers and celebrities such as Mei Lanfang broadcast songs, which lasted until 2:00 AM this morning. The scholarship target was 10 billion. Party and state elder Wu Zhihui first donated 1 million yuan to promote it. In addition, Pan Gongzhan donated 20 million yuan, and elementary school student Pan Yinbao donated 10 million yuan from candy money. People from all walks of life generously donated enthusiastically. As of 1:30 AM this morning, the total amount had reached 8 billion. It is expected that by 2:00 AM, the 10 billion target will be reached.</p>

<h3>Buying Up Strong Laborers to Send to Communist Areas; Several Young Men Escape and Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Authorities Reportedly Detain Several Key Suspects</p>
<p>The Shanghai Customs authorities recently received a tip that the Communists have secretly established an organization in the city to buy up strong laborers, paying between 60 million and 100 million yuan per person. After being bought up, these laborers are concentrated in groups of more than 10 people each time and secretly sent to the Communist areas in northern Jiangsu for strict training before being assigned to work on the front lines. Their targets for buying up in Shanghai are three: 1. Refugees, 2. Students, 3. Impoverished workers. All must be young. The method of buying up is to lure them in the name of joining the national army, tricking them into receiving money. Many young men have been deceived. After arriving at the location, several people discovered that it was not the national army and escaped back to Shanghai, reporting to the relevant authorities in the city. The authorities are now investigating based on the clues. It is reported that several key suspects have been detained and are being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Forging Export Certificates for Fraud: The Truth Comes to Light; Two Section Chiefs of the Ministry of Food Flee; Xia Shuhui Detained for Interrogation; Doctor Tao Youxin Also Arrested</h3>
<p>The case of forged food export certificates discovered by the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has been fully solved. The three suspects, Ge Chengqi, Sun Zhongyi, and Ding Xingwu, have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Zhou Yuyong and Wang Keqiang, the main culprits of forging export licenses in Nanjing, section chiefs of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food and the Land Tax Department, respectively, have fled upon hearing the news and are currently being pursued by the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department. Two other main culprits, Tao Youxin, a doctor at the Zhonghua Clinic, and Xia Shuhui, a section chief of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food, have been arrested by the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department. After an overnight interrogation, it was learned that a wide range of people were involved and that it was an organized corruption case. The Criminal Police Team is still investigating based on the confessions. The following is an exploration of the process of solving the case: Ma Jianqi (Shandong native), a Yantai grain merchant residing at No. 15 Sijing Road in the city, applied to the Yantai Municipal Government some months ago and was granted an import permit for 5,000 bags. At the same time, Ge Chengqi (Shandong native), a merchant residing at No. 461 Huayuan Hotel in the city, also applied to the Qingdao Municipal Government for permission to import 40,000 bags of flour. After approval by the Qingdao Municipal Government, an import permit for flour was issued, but the amount was reduced to 12,000 bags. The two then</p>
<p>jointly entrusted a person named Sun Zhongyi to approach the Ministry of Food in Nanjing for export certificates. Sun then entrusted a grain merchant named Song Guanjun, who introduced Tao Youxin, a doctor at the Zhonghua Clinic at No. 60 Tongren Street in Nanjing. Tao then agreed to help find a way. Tao has an elder brother named Tao Youzhi, who runs the Fuxing Oil Shop at No. 98 Shanxi Road. Tao Youzhi often went to the Ministry of Food to purchase oil for public servants, so he was very familiar with two officials in the Ministry of Food. He then took the flour import permits applied for by Ma and Ge in Qingdao and Yantai to contact people in the Ministry of Food. On July 25, Tao telegraphed Ma and Ge in Shanghai, saying that the export permits had been processed and urged them</p>
<p>to come to Beijing to collect them. The two returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the 29th and obtained two export permits. The permit for flour issued to Yantai was for delivery to Yantai Xintai Firm. The officials from the Ministry of Food who came forward to negotiate were Zhou Yuyong and Xia Shuhui, section chiefs of the Control Department, and Wang Keqiang, a section chief of the Land Tax Department. It was stated that the handling fee (i.e., the fee for processing the export certificate) was 500,000 yuan per bag, and the handling fee for the two batches of 17,000 bags totaled 8.5 billion yuan. Ma and Ge paid 10 taels, 3 mace, 1 fen, and 5 li of gold. Wang and Zhou issued a sample paper, which read: "Borrowed from Mr. Tao Youxin 10 taels, 3 mace, 1 fen, and 5 li of gold. The remaining balance will be paid after the Ministry of Food notifies the telegraph to Shanghai." Signed Wang Keqiang and Zhou Yuyong, with the date of July 25 of this year. After Ma and Ge obtained the export permits, they</p>
<p>took them back to Shanghai. At 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month, Ding Xingwu of the Yongfengli Customs Brokerage accompanied Ge to the Jianghai Customs to process the flour export procedures. The Customs Anti-Smuggling Section discovered that the Customs had not received a telegraphic notice from the Ministry of Food for the two certificates. After further review, it was found that the seal of the Ministry of Food that was printed was smaller than the original, the handwriting was slightly different, and one character in the seal of the person who sealed the certificate did not match the original.</p>
<p>They were immediately considered counterfeit. The Customs then selected ports to detain Ge and Ding and added interrogation. Ge confessed the circumstances of obtaining the export permits, but did not know whether they were forged. After the Customs received the confession, they immediately arrested Sun Zhongyi in Shanghai and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Food to investigate the truth. After Ma learned of this, he also rushed to Nanjing overnight to accuse Zhou Yuyong, Xia Shuhui, and Wang Keqiang, section chiefs of the Ministry of Food, of fraud and embezzlement to the Criminal Police Second Detachment. After receiving the report, the police dispatched Song Guanjun and Tao Youxin, the introducers, to the team for questioning. After learning the truth, on the afternoon of the 6th, the squad leader of the Criminal Police Second Detachment visited Liu Xingji of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food. After Director Liu investigated and found that the two export certificates</p>
<p>were forged, Zhou Yuyong, a section chief of the Control Department who was involved in the case, had taken leave and left Beijing a few days ago. Wang Keqiang, a section chief of the Land Tax Department, also left Beijing privately on the morning of the 5th, and his whereabouts are unknown. Xia Shuhui, a section chief of the Control Department, was still working in the department. The police then sent personnel to arrest Xia. However, because the case involved many people, Nanjing has paid close attention to it. The Capital Criminal Police Team has transferred a large number of officers to investigate.</p>
<h3>Armed Fight Between Old and New Dock Workers; More Than Ten People Injured, One Drowned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Huangpu River in Nanshi Guan Bridge, yesterday at around 6:00 AM, a batch of old dock workers from the Yongxinji Transportation Company resumed their work. At around 7:00 PM, these more than 50 workers were resting on the Da Shanghai ship between buoys 8 and 9. Unexpectedly, more than 10 boats suddenly arrived, carrying more than 200 new workers, all holding wooden sticks and tree branches. They rushed onto the ship and engaged in an armed fight with the old workers. The injured on both sides included Chen Yong, Xiao Liansheng, and Han Hongxiao, totaling more than 10 people. One person slipped and drowned in the river. After the Maritime Police Bureau was notified, they ordered a large number of police officers to rush to the scene and arrested several suspects. The injured were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Social Welfare Construction Association; Actively Promoting Nine Major Goals</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Social Welfare Construction Association, after several months of preparation, held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at the Wuxi Association Hall.

<h3>42 Female Police Officers Are Brave and Do Not Yield to Men; Work Efficiency is Close to Ideal; Enough to Raise the Spirits of Urban Women</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Among the urban working women recently, the 42 female police officers of the Municipal Police Bureau are quite eye-catching. They have all received education above the high school and vocational school level, and their average age is between 20 and 25 years old. There are more from Zhejiang. Last year, they were openly recruited by the police bureau. Due to the high standards, only 42 people were finally admitted. After training at the police training center, they officially graduated at the military parade held by the Zhongzheng Middle Road Police Bureau in January of this year and began their duties.</p>
<p>These 42 female police officers are all physically fit and beautiful. For example, Miss Yin Peizheng once represented the police team in the sword dance performance at this year's National Games. Her rotations were like flying, and the wind rose suddenly, earning a lot of praise. Misses Jiang Jianqun and Tang Suzhen are even taller and slender. They served as flag bearers in the New Year's Day military parade, and their brave appearance was enough to raise the spirits of urban women. In addition, there is also Miss Ye Ying, who is known as the "Flower of Female Police Officers." She is smart and lively, so she is assigned to work in the Public Relations Section.</p>
<p>Their only characteristic is that they can develop their various skills evenly, and with their courage and attention to detail, their efficiency in both internal and external work is close to ideal. For example, in the Records Section of the Criminal Investigation Section of the Criminal Department, they are able to cope with ease in the work of inspecting fingerprints, analyzing psychology, and investigating criminals. They also make great contributions in other areas, such as participating in special business inspections and compiling household registration cards. In particular, the female police officers who participated in the work of the Economic Police Brigade, such as Miss Zhu Dayu, once disguised themselves as customers and recently cracked many large-scale black market gold banknote cases, making outstanding contributions.</p>
<p>Currently, these female police officers all live in the western dormitory of the police bureau. They have freedom in their lives and are not strictly managed. They believe that the current service environment is not much different from when they were in school.</p>
<p>The picture above shows the leisure of a group of female police officers during their rest time.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Special Relief Donations: First Step Fails, Mayor to Take Second Step, Personally Calling on the Doors of the Wealthy; If Still Ignored, Names Will Be Publicized</h3>
<p>Regarding the special relief donation in this city, despite repeated solicitations by the municipal authorities and much persuasion, the response from contributors has not been enthusiastic. According to recent information obtained by our reporter, after several meetings to discuss the fundraising efforts, the Special Donation Fundraising Committee originally decided on three steps. First, the Mayor would invite wealthy individuals in his private capacity, asking them to make on-the-spot pledges for a certain amount (the pledge amounts were pre-determined by the Fundraising Committee). Second, if the first step failed, Mayor Wu would personally call on the doors of wealthy individuals, requesting donations in person. Third, if the door-to-door solicitations proved ineffective, the names of the wealthy individuals would be publicized, followed by a renewed request for donations, and those with evidence of having aided the enemy during the period of enemy occupation would have their misdeeds publicized. Currently, regarding the above three measures, the first step, involving the Mayor's invitation, has already been carried out, but many of those invited did not attend, so the first step has clearly failed, and the second step will be implemented within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Asleep and Brutally Attacked, Blood Splatters the Bed: Wife of National Assembly Representative Wang Guanying in Critical Condition; Assailant is Husband's Friend, Two Theories on the Motive</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Min Binru (pictured), wife of Jiangxi National Assembly Representative Wang Guanying, was assassinated at her residence at 5:20 AM yesterday, leaving her in critical condition. The assailant, Li Zongguang, was apprehended on the spot. Afterwards, according to her family, the motive for the murder was purely for financial gain. However, according to the assailant Li Zongguang's statement at the police station, the situation is much more complex, claiming that Wang's wife was unable to distinguish between kindness and resentment and was intolerable in her ridicule and sarcasm, thus he acted out of anger.</p>
<p>Li is 38 years old, from Hubei. He and Wang Guanying were originally close friends and had frequent interactions in Chongqing before the victory. Last year, due to the failure of his alcohol factory, he became financially distressed and travelled to Shanghai, lodging with Wang and frequently seeking his assistance. Yesterday, he was refused a request for funds by Wang's wife, and considering the effort he had put into Wang Guanying's National Assembly campaign in the past, and the cold treatment he now received, he harbored vicious intentions.</p>
<p>Wang's wife, Min Binru, is from Wuxian, Jiangsu, and is 42 years old. She studied in the United States and obtained a Master's degree in Education from Harvard University. During the War of Resistance, she served as a professor at various universities in Chongqing, director of the girls' department of Southwest Middle School, and president of the Jiangxi branch of the Comforting Association. She came to Shanghai after the victory and resided at No. 5 Zhonghe New Village, Xinda Road. Li Zongguang had been lodging with Wang for half a year, during which time, unfortunately, a rift developed in their friendship. Yesterday morning at 4 AM, Min returned from outside and had just fallen asleep when Li Zongguang took the opportunity to sneak into the bedroom and struck her head with a hammer. She was severely injured in the back of the head, left eye, etc., and blood splattered all over the bed. In extreme pain, she cried out, which was heard by her older sister, Min Jianru, who was the first to enter and hold the assailant. Subsequently, the family rushed to report to the police, and the assailant was apprehended.</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, Wang Guanying was in Nanjing. After receiving the news at 7 AM yesterday, he took a flight back to Shanghai in the afternoon. The case is currently under investigation by the Xincheng Police Station. The victim, Min Binru, was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. It is reported that her injuries are serious, and she remains in critical condition.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits Use Power Plant Sabotage Case to Intimidate Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Since the power company's treacherous elements Wang Xiaohe and Wu Guozhen sabotaged the power plant and were sentenced to death according to law, the treacherous party has attempted to exploit this opportunity to incite labor unrest. Recently, they have been sending anonymous letters to various labor unions, distorting the facts and deliberately threatening them. The envelopes even falsely claim to be from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Son of Philippine President Refuses to Divulge Secrets; Only Says Purpose of Coming to Shanghai is to Negotiate Commercial and Industrial Business; Expresses Great Surprise at Many Phenomena in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Osmanie, the son of the Philippine President, flew from Manila to Shanghai last Wednesday. Our reporter recently visited him at the International Hotel. Osmanie is young, tall, and energetic, with a light and humorous tone. According to the business card he presented, his title is only listed as "Commercial and Industrial Business Consultant." He said: He has worked in the Philippine financial sector for more than ten years and has close ties with the commercial, industrial, and financial sectors in the Philippines. Therefore, his recent professional focus has been on commercial and industrial business consulting. Whether it is domestic or foreign individuals who intend to invest in various commercial and industrial enterprises in the Philippines, he is willing to serve them wholeheartedly, providing design and planning to ensure that the invested enterprises can grow and prosper. His mission here is also to conduct business negotiations with people in this city. When asked by the reporter what matters and with whom he was negotiating, he smiled and replied, "This is a matter of commercial confidentiality, and I am afraid I cannot disclose it for the time being."</p>
<p>He said: China and the Philippines have close ties in terms of ethnicity, economy, and politics. Therefore, cooperation should be strived for in all aspects. He expressed incomprehension about the current large-scale flight of Chinese capital to Hong Kong. He reported that the Philippines currently has many promising industries, including the textile industry, paper industry, plywood industry, and mining (metal mining) industry, all of which are waiting to be developed with great potential and profits, and he urged people from all walks of life to invest more to enhance the economic exchanges between the Philippines and foreign countries.</p>
<p>Revisiting Old Haunts After a Decade</p>
<p>This is Osmanie's first visit to Shanghai since the Pacific War. He stated: Before the war, he often took advantage of his holidays to travel to Shanghai irregularly. Having been away from Shanghai for a decade, he believes that the appearance of Shanghai is still the same as before, as if it has not suffered the devastation of war. The streets are even cleaner than before. However, the drastic changes in the internal substance of Shanghai are quite shocking to him. Among these, the inflation of currency is particularly acute and rapid. In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, the appearance has been severely damaged, the buildings are fragmented, and the streets are messy, which cannot be compared with Shanghai. Fortunately, the internal substance is still good, and the economic and financial situation is relatively stable, but the cost of living has obviously increased significantly compared with before the war. The salaried class with average income is more affected, but the labor class, who sell their labor every day, can earn an average of US$5 per person, and their living conditions are better than those of the teachers. Overseas Chinese have clearly occupied the retail market in the Philippines. He hopes that overseas Chinese can unite and serve the interests of the public.</p>
<p>Departing for the Philippines in a Few Days</p>
<p>He expressed surprise at the low price of rice in this city, as the price of rice in the Philippines is US$10 per stone. He stated: The Philippines does not prohibit the free trading of gold. The official price of gold is US$35 per ounce, but the market trading price often fluctuates around US$42. Except for the United States, the Philippines is not allowed to export gold to other countries. Finally, he inquired about the circulation of various newspapers in this city and told the reporter: The Manila Times has the widest circulation in Manila, with a daily circulation of 70,000 to 80,000 copies. Osmanie will stay in Shanghai for a few more days and plans to return to the Philippines within this week.</p>
<h3>Head of Western Food Department at YMCA Stabbed to Death; Assailant Leaves Behind a Large Knife; Found in the Deceased's Pants</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Xu Lizhi, 52, from Yantai, Shandong, the manager of the Western food department at the YMCA on Sichuan Road, residing at No. 199 Wenlin Road, Hengshan Road, was returning home from work at around 9:50 PM last night when a thug suddenly rushed forward from the side of the road at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Hong Kong Road, stabbing him in the back with a large foreign knife. The tip of the knife pierced through his chest, and he immediately fell to the ground in pain. The assailant fled without a trace. At the same time, Xu's employee, surnamed Shao, was also returning home from work, passing by this place when he saw his boss lying in a pool of blood. He immediately called the police to the scene and urgently hired a car to rush him to the Public Concession Hospital for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. After receiving the report, the Huangpu Police Station, under the order of Chief Feng of the Criminal Division, led by Section Chief Li and officers Ren Fengwu and others, rushed to the scene to investigate and summoned his eldest son, Xu Jingwu, to the station for questioning. According to the investigation, the large foreign knife used by the assailant was later found in the deceased's pants pocket, stained with blood. It was assumed that the assailant had stuffed it in afterwards and was taken back to the police station for safekeeping.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Price Increase Issue: Public Utilities Bureau Answers Inquiries from Council Members</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has prepared written responses to the various points raised by the councilors at the meeting of the Public Utilities Committee on August 6, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It is true that the various companies suffered huge losses in July, so they directly reported to the Mayor for relief. The subsequent publications in the newspapers also stated the facts directly and cannot be compared to creating an atmosphere.</p>
<p>(2) The current price adjustments for electricity, telephone, and gas adopt a differential system, originally to take care of the burden on general small users, and this is being tried out in respect of the speaker's and the Mayor's wishes. If the Council has other decisions, it will be followed. This differential system is indeed beneficial for small users.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Public Utilities Investigation Committee's report on the Shanghai Electric Power Company's income and expenditure statement for March 1948, it should be noted that although the figures for "dividends," "interest," "depreciation," and "other" in the expenditure section of the statement are large, they are only accounting representations. The cash income and expenditure are actually loss-making rather than profitable, so the total income and expenditure are not balanced. The Bureau's calculation of prices does not follow the accounting expenditure, but is calculated according to a formula. The "other" item is not included, and only a small amount of "dividends," "interest," and "depreciation" are included.</p>
<p>(4) The calculation of the multiple of price increases should be based on the average price. Therefore, regarding telephone prices, if the price of 320,000 yuan for each call over 300 calls is used as the basis and it is considered to have increased by 10 million times, it may not be accurate. In fact, the high price is only charged after more than 300 calls have been made. Also, the fare for the former No. 2 tram from the Bund to Jing'an Temple was actually 6.5 cents in 25 years, not three copper coins. The fare for the No. 16 trolleybus was actually 10 cents, not five copper coins. Therefore, the claim that it has increased by 15 million times is not true.</p>
<p>(5) The base numbers in the price calculation formula are all negotiated in accordance with common practice and local actual conditions. For example, regarding public vehicles, the mileage per gallon of fuel in Shanghai is only about 6 kilometers due to the short traffic stops in the city and the many traffic lights in the bustling areas, but it has reached more than 7 kilometers in the suburbs.</p>
<p>(6) It is true that the salaries of foreign employees of foreign companies are converted using US dollars, but these employees had contracts with the company before the war, and they are now continuing to perform them. There are only 48 such people left, and the number is continuing to decrease. As for the other approximately 100 foreign employees who have not signed contracts, they are all paid according to the local cost of living index, which is the same as that of Chinese employees.</p>
<p>(7) In the past, the monthly price adjustments used the index number of the previous month, which resulted in huge losses for the company. Now, the index number of the current month is used. Before the index number is determined, it is tentatively estimated by adding 50% to the index number of the previous month.</p>
<p>(8) The reason why the current public transportation fares have a small difference in mileage is to reduce short-distance passengers in order to reduce congestion, maintain traffic order, and facilitate long-distance passengers.</p>
<p>(9) The continued recognition of the exclusive rights of foreign companies is based on the principle of equal new treaty agreements between China and the United States and China and the United Kingdom. However, since foreign companies are now subject to the management of the Chinese government, the policy adopted by the municipal government is to respect human agreements and enforce laws.</p>
<p>(10) Most of the repair work for the Shanghai Telephone Company's equipment is indeed contracted to the China Electric Company. This is because the company has supply contracts with the Electric Company for most telephone materials. However, the prices of new materials, such as when ordering from abroad, are restricted by international price comparisons and cannot be arbitrarily increased.</p>
<h3>Extorting Fees for Adding Household Registrations: Two Jia Leaders Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There have been frequent reports recently of district Baojia leaders taking advantage of their positions to engage in corruption and bribery. Recently, Guo Yuanhe, the Jia leader of the Sixth Jia of the 47th Bao of Beizhan, and Yu Mingzhao, the Jia leader of the Seventh Jia of the same Bao, were both sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment by the criminal court of the district court for repeatedly taking advantage of their positions to fraudulently obtain property. The reason is that from December of last year to March of this year, when the households in the Jia added household registrations and applied for identity cards, Jia leader Guo Yuanhe successively extorted a total of 1.6 million yuan from Gao Yingxiang, Qian Renyi, Wang Hongbao, Zhang Qijia, Wang Baoyu, Chen Yuxi (Chen Lixi), Qian Heqing, Chen Guocai, Dai Qingfu, and others. Yu Mingzhao, the Jia leader of the Seventh Jia, also extorted a total of 740,000 yuan from Zhang Xueqing, Lu Hongsheng, Xue Yongsong, and others. The household registrations and identity cards of the various households were still left at the Jia leader's office and had not been issued. Later, Gao Yingxiang and others jointly filed a lawsuit, which was investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutor, and the sentence was made as above in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Gang Leader Song Xiangming Arrested</h3>
<p>The city's Water Police Branch received a tip-off the day before yesterday that Song Xiangming, the leader of the "Six Shares Gang," was hiding in the Pudong anchorage, and the police station dispatched personnel to arrest him. The offender has many followers and specializes in stealing goods at various docks. On the 28th of last month, Song led his gang to steal oil drums from the Jiangxi Road Petroleum Company. When the police station dispatched personnel to arrest them, Song led his gang to resist arrest. At that time, two of his gang members, Zhang Heshang and Zhu Dadanzi, were arrested, but Zhu escaped. According to the arrested Zhang Heshang and others, they were arrested and sentenced in 1946 for stealing cowhide at the dock. After serving their sentences and being released from prison, they resumed their old business. The theft of a large number of oil drums from the Petroleum Company and the theft of household rice were all committed by them. The police station has now escorted Zhang and Zhu to the court for interrogation. Song Xiangming, who was arrested the day before yesterday, is currently being detained for detailed interrogation.</p>

<h3>Air Tickets Difficult to Purchase, Scalpers Rampant, Black Market Exceeds Five Times the Price, Companies Strictly Crack Down, Assign Personnel to Verify Photos</h3>
<p>The China and Central Airlines companies reduced the number of flights on various lines to reduce expenses due to the difficulty in purchasing gasoline and the difficulty in covering expenses. As a result, passengers traveling from far away to Shanghai or wanting to go to the mainland from Shanghai feel that the journey is far away, and airplane tickets have become a rare commodity. Scalpers have emerged, and the black market price of airplane tickets is more than five times higher than the original price. For example, the ticket price from Shanghai to Lanzhou is 340 million yuan, but the black market price is more than 1 billion yuan. Passengers are unable to purchase tickets and can only pay the price in pain. The authorities of the two companies have become aware of this and have recently stipulated that passengers must provide a personal photograph when purchasing tickets. Personnel are assigned to stand next to the plane and secretly verify the photographs upon boarding. If there is any discrepancy, boarding will be prohibited. At the same time, it is hoped that passengers will not be fooled by scalpers and will assist the company in cracking down on these unscrupulous people.</p>

<h3>Breaking the Case of the Jinan Organization that Aided the Communists and Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Li Tian</p>
<p>[Report from Jinan by air on the 5th of this month] Due to the unexpected success of the espionage work that led to the capture of Yanzhou on the 13th of last month—the primary reason being not the strength of the Communist bandits' fighting power but the infiltration of Communist spies into the National Army's various levels of units, including the confidential secretary of Commander Li Yutang also being a "Red Army," and even finding bombs under Commander Li's bedroom bed—this greatly heightened the alertness of the military and civilians here in this aspect, and at the same time strengthened their defenses.</p>
<p>Smuggling Electrical Machinery in Attempt to Exchange for Cotton and Millet</p>
<p>Under the multifaceted efforts of a certain unit, Jinan recently uncovered a smuggling organization of an unprecedented scale that aided the Communists with various materials (including military equipment). The time was at dawn on July 27th. Sun Maotang, the deputy manager of Yitaihe Freight Forwarding (who previously served as a staff sergeant in the Air Force ground service unit), hired a large cart from Xiao Youqing (who regularly transports goods between Jinan and the Communist-controlled areas in northern Shandong) with the assistance of his assistant, Sun Xueliang, at the west gate of Jingyi Weiwu Road in Jinan. In reality, what was loaded were four large crates of wireless radio equipment, five-kilowatt transmitters, eleven and a half horsepower generators, and other communications materials. On top, many crates of liquid manure were placed as camouflage. After Sun and his associates spent more than two months planning and over 17 billion yuan in "lubrication fees," the electrical machinery naturally passed smoothly through all the checkpoints and inspection stations. On the morning of the 27th, it was smoothly transported across the Yellow River to Tianshui Well. At this time, Sun and his associates felt as if a weight had been lifted from their hearts. They went from being happy to being proud, and from being proud to being carried away. They were convinced that this mission had been successfully accomplished and that the money was guaranteed. A set of electrical machinery and radio equipment worth only several hundred billion yuan can be exchanged for 100,000 catties of cotton and 200,000 catties of millet (according to Sun and others' confessions), worth over 2 trillion yuan. What is this if not "ten thousand profits for a single investment"?</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Armed Bandits Open Fire and Concentrate Their Shooting</p>
<p>Just as Sun and his associates were elated, personnel from a certain unit who had been following them, deciding that the matter could not be delayed, forced them to transport the cart back to the south bank of the Yellow River. At this time, Sun and his associates realized that their "success was about to fail," but due to the disparity in numbers, they had no choice but to transport the cart back onto the boat, and the boat set off from the shore to the south bank again. Before the boat had left the shore for five minutes, over a hundred "armed Red Army" members, who were responsible for receiving this batch of supplies, rushed to the Yellow River bank. Seeing the boat heading south, they concentrated their shooting in an attempt to force the boat to return to the north bank. At this time, the personnel from a certain unit on the boat, in addition to ordering the boatman to row harder to the south, also fired back. Another team of personnel from a certain unit, who had been ambushed in the sorghum fields on the bank, although small in number, were all crack shots who could "fire with both hands." Therefore, after a barrage of fire from both the bank and the center of the river, the bandits were unable to determine the strength of the unit and had no intention of fighting. In haste, they had no choice but to retreat north towards their base area. The unfortunate thing was that when the gunfire was intense, other civilian boats in the river, trying to escape, unfortunately collided with each other and sank one of them, with over twenty people buried in the bellies of fish. After the "people and loot" were brought to a certain unit, Sun and his associates naturally had no way to deny it. In Sun and his associates' confessions, it was learned that Li Xigui, the manager of Yitaihe Freight Forwarding, and the shareholder Yan Fenglai, were all "Red Army" members. However, they had already fled to Dezhou. Li was sent by the Industry and Commerce Bureau of Xiakou Town to Jinan City to specifically transport materials on behalf of the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>Detaining Over Twenty Key Suspects and Sealing Five Shops</p>
<p>What happened after Sun Maotang and his associates were detained was "no coincidence, no story." A certain gentleman, residing in the same courtyard as the Yitaihe Freight Forwarding, had long suspected that they were not good people, given the large number of people entering and exiting the freight forwarding company and the frequent appearance of plainclothes personnel carrying guns in the evenings. After hearing about a major smuggling case being intercepted by a certain unit, the freight forwarding company's personnel immediately fled. Only one person was sent to the freight forwarding company every day to check on the "situation." This gentleman happened to have a friend serving in a certain unit, so he reported it. On the 29th, in addition to detaining Wu Wangzhu (who previously served as a staff sergeant in the Air Force reception center), who was responsible for "keeping watch," Zhao Haibo, who was sent by the Communist-controlled areas to serve as a liaison, was also detained. In Wu and others' confessions, it was also learned that the electrical machinery was purchased from a certain military organization through Taichang Trading Company, which was responsible for the technical matters of repairing, loading, and transporting. At the same time, it was revealed that Lihuo Oil and Grain Store, Yihua Leather Shoe Store, and others, a total of five stores including the former one, were all in contact with the Communist bandits. As for how the goods were transported out, it was done through the relationships of Liu Wenyu (acting group leader of the Lu Province Government Investigation Office in Luokou), Zheng Lianyuan, Jiang Zhenlai, and others. How many billions A used, and how many billions B took, etc., were all revealed. Therefore, as a result of this case, over twenty people have been arrested, and up to five business establishments have been sealed.</p>
<p>Wang Yaowu Has Indicated That the Main Culprits Will Definitely Be Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Since this unprecedented smuggling case of military communications equipment was solved, the people of Jinan were all delighted. The person in charge of a certain unit said to Commander Wang Yaowu: "Commander, you certainly know that bombs were found under the bed of Commander Li Yutang in Yanzhou. We are here to clear the bombs for Commander Wang. As for how to punish them, that is entirely up to the Commander." At that time, Commander Wang not only expressed his deep appreciation and commendation but also stated that the ringleaders would definitely be sentenced to death after a clear trial to serve as a warning. He also personally ordered Director Lu Dengke of the Adjutant's Office and Director Zhou Chuansheng of the Military Police Investigation Office to jointly handle the matter. Under the effective cooperation and strict deployment of Lu and Zhou, the key suspects in the case were largely apprehended.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Yunshang Silk Store Announces Liquidation of Illegally Transferred Inventory</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi on the 5th of this month] The wave of business failures is unfolding in Wuxi. Yunshang Silk Store on Beiwai Tongyun Road once ran aground a few days ago. After finding a solution, it resumed business as usual. On the 5th, it suddenly closed down again, and an advertisement for a law firm was posted on the door, announcing the liquidation of assets, limiting all creditors to register within seven days. After learning of this, the creditors rushed to the store to negotiate, inspect the inventory, and discovered that there were instances of illegally transferring goods. They immediately took the matter to the East District Police Station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Outside the Pass, Continued (3) - Night in the Dunhuang Stone Chambers</h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 2nd dispatch] On the morning of July 17th, County Magistrate Zou of Dunhuang accompanied us to visit Crescent Moon Spring southeast of the city. The ox cart traveled very slowly on the sand for more than ten li, and the round trip took more than two hours. Crescent Moon Spring is located in the center of a group of pure sand hills. The highest one is called Singing Sand Mountain, which is more than 20 zhang high, about 50 li long, and about 20 li wide. If a dozen or twenty people slide down the mountainside in a team, the friction between the sand grains, plus the echoes from the surrounding sand mountains, will produce a loud buzzing sound. However, there were not many of us climbing the mountain, and we only browsed the summit. The water of Crescent Moon Spring is clear and emerald green, shaped like a crescent moon. Legend has it that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty obtained a winged horse at Crescent Moon Spring, which could reach Anxi in one day and night. Now there is a stele of "Han Wowa Pond" beside the spring. There are six temples by the spring, all built by Taoism. Except for the Medicine King Temple, there is nothing worth seeing in the statues.</p>
<p>Thousand Buddha Caves – Development History</p>
<p>We returned to Dunhuang County in the afternoon for a short rest, and in the evening we took a car to the Thousand Buddha Caves. The Thousand Buddha Caves, also known as the Mogao Grottoes, are located at the foot of the Sanwei Mountain, 20 kilometers southeast of Dunhuang County. Snow water flowing from the Sanwei Mountain has cut through the sand mountains, forming a gully about two to three zhang wide. The bottom of the gully is flat with gravel. The east bank is about one to two zhang high, while the west bank varies from one to twenty zhang. The stone chambers are row upon row of caves on the cliffs of the west bank.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of the Dunhuang Stone Chambers, Secretary Chen of the county government, who accompanied us, said that the Shazhou Chronicles record that they were "created in the year of Gui Chou in the ninth year of Yonghe." The creation period of this cave should be in 353 AD. Local Taoists also talked about the motivation for building the caves: the sand mountain was cut off by the flood from the south, and there was still quicksand at the higher places on the west bank. When the sun set, because the sand was five-colored (but it looked like a mixed white color when we looked at it from the military camp), it was reflected by the sunlight and became ten thousand golden rays, which disappeared after sunset. In the first year of Taihe of Emperor Guang of Jin (366 AD), the monk Le Zun saw this wonder and thought it was the light of the Buddha. So he carved the first cave on the stone wall to sculpt the Buddha's image for worship. Later, Zen Master Fa Liang built another cave. During the Northern Wei Dynasty, several more caves were built. During the Tang Dynasty, Buddhism flourished, and there were more than a thousand cave rooms, hence the name Thousand Buddha Caves. According to common legends, during the Tang Dynasty, when the Western Regions were accessible, the Mogao Grottoes were a major road for travelers. Therefore, people who were sending off or saying goodbye prayed in the stone chambers to seek divine protection. Later, when they returned safely, they expanded the stone chambers, wrote scriptures, and offered Buddhas to repay the gods. This theory is more reasonable.</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Volumes of Tang Dynasty Sutras</p>
<p>There are several temples in the Thousand Buddha Caves, divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Temples. We stayed overnight in the Lower Temple. Next to the temple is the Sutra Cave. During the Xixia Rebellion in the Song Dynasty, the monks of the Thousand Buddha Caves were about to flee to other places, so they sealed the scriptures, Buddha statues, and other items here. The cave is inside a passage and is extremely dark. We used the light of flashlights to inspect it. The cave is not large and can accommodate more than ten people. On the wall facing the entrance of the cave, there is also a Song Dynasty painting of ladies, which Zhang Daqian made a copy of.</p>
<p>The Taoist said about the discovery process: At the end of the Qing Dynasty, a Taoist priest from Hubei named Wang Yuanlu cleared the sand in the three-story cave with running water on May 25th of the lunar calendar in the 25th year of Guangxu. A crack appeared in the wall as the sand flowed out, as if there was light. He broke through the wall and found a double cave, which was suddenly bright and open. It contained ten thousand volumes of Tang Dynasty scriptures and countless antiques. Those who saw it were amazed as a spectacle, and those who heard about it spread it as a divine object. At that time, the magistrate of Dunhuang, Zai Zonghan, took some scriptures and portraits from Wang Taoist and transferred a part to Xue Tai Ye Changchi. Ye once suggested that these relics be transported to Lanzhou for preservation, but later ordered them to be sealed up due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>In the 33rd year of Guangxu, the Hungarian Stein purchased 3,000 complete long-scroll scriptures and 6,000 damaged ones, totaling 24 boxes, as well as 5 boxes of Buddhist paintings and embroidery from Wang Taoist and transported them to London. The following year, the Frenchman Bo Xihe bought more than 1,500 items from Wang Taoist with a large sum of money. Afterwards, although the government repeatedly ordered proper preservation, many were still bought by theft. When we came, we had no chance to see the Tang Dynasty scriptures again.</p>
<p>Research Institute Promotes Art</p>
<p>Now the Ministry of Education has established a Dunhuang Art Research Institute there to study and promote this treasure of Chinese Buddhist art. At the same time, a new exhibition hall has been built to display and compare the copied representative works, and new caves are constantly being excavated. There has been a lot of publicity about the research work on the Mogao Grottoes in China. Our one-night stay and four-hour tour here only gave us a concept: The caves will inevitably become the center of our country's art with the evolution of time, because its scope is too vast.</p>
<p>The director of the research institute, Mr. Chang Shuhong, went to Beijing on official business. Mr. Duan accompanied us on the visit. That day, we talked until midnight before resting. According to what he told us: There is also a Ten Thousand Buddha Gorge in Anxi (that is, Yulin Grottoes), and the works are more complete and systematic. In the past, because the local area was not peaceful, it was planned to conduct a long-term study there this winter. In addition, there are several caves west of Dunhuang County, but unfortunately many have been stolen.</p>
<p>The night in the Thousand Buddha Caves is the most unforgettable night of my life. Outside the window, everything is silent, the night is as cool as water, only the poplars are rustling, the moonlight is holding up the beehive-like stone treasure, the breeze is ringing the copper bells in the corner of the temple, and wild wolves are howling from the distance from time to time.</p>
<h3>Strange Well Discovered in Jinan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 8th dispatch] A strange well has been discovered here where people and poultry die immediately after entering. In the Jinan Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters on Jingsan Road and Weishi Road in this city, there was originally a cave well dug during the enemy's time, which was usually used to store miscellaneous items. On the morning of the 6th, Zhang Yumin (24 years old), a worker in the factory, went to the well to store items, but did not come out for a long time. After being discovered, he died of illness. Another older worker was sent down to the well to rescue him, but the worker shouted for help after entering the well and was immediately pulled up, luckily avoiding death. The employees of the factory, seeing this scene, threw a live chicken into the well as an experiment, and it died immediately. It is reported that the factory has reported the incident to the court and requested an inspection.</p>
<h3>Robbing Wheat Boats, Plotting Money and Murdering - The Baitangwei Murder Case in Wuxi - Five Bandits Arrested, Mastermind Escapes</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wuxi, 7th dispatch] Zhu Xinbao and others from Jiangyin loaded wheat in Cheng on the 21st of last month to sell it in Wuxi. They encountered bandits in Baitangwei, which belongs to the county. Six people, including his associates Liu Aqi, Ren Yinfu, Wang Qinxia, Wang Jinsheng, and Zhu's wife Suying, were all tied up and drowned in the river. The wheat they were transporting was also robbed by the bandits. Several days later, the bodies were found in the original place, and the situation was extremely tragic. Because Suying was pregnant, the fetus flowed out from her lower body. After the local villagers salvaged the bodies ashore, they reported to the local court to send personnel to examine them, confirming that it was a case of plotting money and murder. After the case occurred, all parties were shocked. County Chief Zhou specially ordered his subordinates to solve the case within a time limit. By the end of last month, the Zhangcun District Office suddenly received information that gamblers in the Beixizhang area were highly suspected, so they joined the county government's intelligence office to arrest the suspects Sun Abing, Sun Axi, Zhao Xiaogou, Xu Fulin, and Sun Shungen at their addresses and presented them to the county government for interrogation. During the first court session on the 2nd of this month, the military law office, the criminals confessed to participating in the murder and robbery. According to Zhao Xiaogou's confession: "The idea of ​​robbery was initiated by Liu Zhenhe and other four people. There were seven people who went to do it that day. Two short guns belonged to Liu Zhenhe, and two long guns belonged to Sun Abing. The small boat belonged to Sun Shungen and was rocked by Xu Fulin to the mouth of the Yangtang River. When a wheat boat was discovered, Liu Zhenhe first ordered it to dock, and then forced the six men and women on the wheat boat to go ashore, and then stamped the wheat into the small boat. Later, because they wanted cash and jewelry from them, they resisted desperately. Liu Zhenhe told us to do it, and we tied them up one by one. After searching for gold and cash, we threw them all into the river to drown." It was also said that Liu was sent by the New Fourth Army, so the case is now clear. On the 3rd, the county government sent personnel to the countryside to arrest You Baoxing. However, during the continued court session the day before yesterday, the criminals suddenly retracted their confessions, denying all the details of the initial court hearing. The bandit Xu Fulin even claimed that he had a nervous breakdown during the first court hearing, so he spoke nonsense and could not be trusted. However, the military law office believes that the truth of the case is already clear. Once the mastermind Liu Zhenhe is captured, a decision can be made. Yesterday, the police were sent again to Wujiang and asked the county police bureau to investigate and arrest the criminal Liu to bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>General Pan Carries a Big Gun - Takes Two Civilians - Goes Deep into the Countryside of Liaozhong - Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Panyang, 4th dispatch] The reporter traveled south along the Liao River towards the depths of the "pocket". All the green countryside that I passed through and visited was 20 kilometers away from Niuzhuang. The green could not cover up the desolation. In many similar-looking villages, I could not see a ruddy face, a fat pig, or a laying hen. The countryside was silent and depressed. "A look of bitterness, half a pair of broken pants" best illustrates the poverty of the farmers' lives. I met several front-line generals in a farmer's house in Ciyutuo Village. Sitting under the grape trellis and in front of the hibiscus flowers eating watermelon was a different kind of taste. The officers and soldiers of all levels in the front-line troops have unwavering confidence, and their iron discipline has won the gratitude and support of the people.</p>
<p>The Car in the Mud</p>
<p>There is one impression that is most profound on the way back to the headquarters from the front. At dusk on July 24th, our group of four jeeps hurried back. The car in which the reporter and another colleague were sitting with General Pan Yukun was running in front, and the other cars fell behind. They drove across the Liao River pontoon bridge from two different ferry crossings, so they lost contact with each other. At the same time, the car wanted to take a shortcut, so it left the county road and drove into the country road. We asked a farmer to guide us, but he got lost after getting in the car. When the countryside was hidden in the darkness of the night, our car had driven into the mud, and the driver was powerless. We asked two young farmers from the nearest village to help. After an hour, the car was still unable to move forward in the mud. So a farmer volunteered to go to a larger village farther away to find people and horses to help. We sat in the wheat field waiting. At this time, the sky was shining with sparse stars on one side, and dark clouds were densely covered on the other side, with flashes of lightning from time to time. The wind blew the fragrance of the soil, blowing over the sorghum fields as if the sound of thousands of troops and horses was coming from a distance. General Pan was not anxious at all. He chatted with the young farmer. The topic he loved the most was that it took seven pieces of cloth to marry an old woman in the countryside. When the "Eighth Route Army" was there, because marriage also implemented a "rationing" system, the young women rushed to marry the person they liked, just like picking the sweetest peach. Now that the National Army is here, it takes seven pieces of cloth for a girl to get married again. He also bluntly told this officer who did not know the rank that the chickens in his village had been eaten by the "Eighth Route Army". The farmers in the Northeast are really cute. After a while, more than a dozen people came, pulled two horses, and with a shout, the car was pulled out of the mud. They waved goodbye to us happily. They were completely voluntary help, without any reluctance. The car moved forward for about five li and then fell into the mud again. This time we had to walk on foot. We walked into the first village with a garrison. The sentry did not believe that this general was a military commander because he was carrying a big gun, and we were two "civilians".</p>
<p>Relax the Scale of Cold Wind Limits</p>
<p>The situation of purchasing wheat in Liaozhong is very good, on the one hand due to the efforts of the local government and the assistance of the army, on the other hand, after the recovery, the bandit currency was abolished, and the people urgently needed banknotes to exchange for something. Selling wheat is the only way. The circulating currency in the countryside is the circulating coupon, and Guanjin is not yet popular. The four purchasing stations in Liaozhong purchase up to 60,000 catties every day. There are many difficulties, such as too few chips, and the people have to wait to get the money. There are too few scales, and the people have to wait to weigh. The government also feels that there are not enough people. The method of purchase is the "public ownership, public transportation, and public storage" system to facilitate the overall planning of military rations. The farmers hope for "private ownership, private transportation, and private storage." This problem has not been resolved. From the reporter's observation, the scale of transport restrictions should be relaxed. The government allows private transport of up to 100 catties and requires an application for a transport permit and other procedures, which is tantamount to self-blocking. There are a series of political, economic, and social issues waiting to be resolved in the newly recovered land and rural areas, which need to be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>Three Harms in Liaozhong Awaiting Elimination</p>
<p>The reporter visited many farmers and learned that there are three books in Liaozhong that urgently need to be eliminated: (1) is the roving troops that harass the local area, (2) is the intelligence personnel who do evil, and (3) is the Liao River flood, which is rampant every year. In Liaozhong County, less than half a month after the recovery, there are 15 units of roving troops, with more than 4,000 people. Their food and clothing are all taken from the people. A certain Zhu claimed to be a "regiment commander". After being disarmed, his ID card said: "A kick the bucket professional."</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices - The Intermittent Period Has Passed, Prices Are Rising in a Straight Line Again</h3>
<p>The general trend of commodity prices had an intermittent period of just over two weeks, ending last weekend. Last week, amidst widespread talk of loose monetary policy, coupled with the nationwide adjustment of transportation costs and Shanghai's public utility rates, and with a significant increase in freight rates, there was a possibility of triggering a tidal wave of commodity price increases. However, due to rumors that President Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting with Premier Weng Wenhao and others at Mogan Mountain at the end of last month to discuss new economic reform plans and emergency measures to stabilize prices, the market then circulated rumors that the authorities would nationalize gold and freeze savings accounts. Although this was solemnly denied by Governor Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank, major players in the market were nervous and generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Subsequently, as the new economic plan was delayed in its announcement, since Friday, commodity prices in the market have again shown a tendency to rise in a straight line.</p>
<p>Last week, the wholesale price index was 5,177,864 times higher than pre-war levels, an increase of 9.220% compared to the previous week. Last week, monetary policy was loose, and the Central Bank's net outflow of funds was extremely large, with a net outflow of over 570 billion on Friday alone, setting an unprecedented record. According to analysis, this was due to: (1) the Central Bank's outflow was due to fewer banknotes flowing out, with payments and receipts concentrated in clearing; and (2) the outflow of funds for large orders. The black market interest rate fluctuated around five jiao. Last week, the market for foreign exchange certificates was very good, with repeated increases, rising from 5.2 million at the beginning of the week to over 7 million at the weekend. Adding the foreign exchange benchmark price, it was close to the black market rate. Gold ornaments, after resuming business, saw slight fluctuations last week, with a stable trend. Trading was higher at the beginning of the week, with 390 million bought and 430 million sold. Later, there was a slight decline, but from Friday, it rose back to the original level at the beginning of the week, and rose again at the weekend, with 420 million bought and 460 million sold.</p>
<p>The adjustment of new prices for nationwide transportation and Shanghai's public utilities last week was as follows:</p>
<p>First, transportation: (1) Passenger and freight rates on all shipping lines were adjusted from August 5, with an increase of 120%. (2) Passenger and freight rates on all railways nationwide were adjusted from 00:00 on August 6. Passenger fares were calculated at 900,000 times the pre-war standard of 1.5 fen per kilometer, and the current zone calculation method was abolished, with charges based on the actual mileage between stations. Freight rates were calculated at 2 million times the pre-war standard of 2 fen per kilometer per 10 kilograms, with the maximum amount approximately twice the current price. (3) China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation adjusted fares on all routes from August 5, an increase of 34% compared to the previous rates.</p>
<p>Second, Shanghai's public utilities adjusted their new prices. Water and electricity were calculated from August 1, and transportation from August 5. Comparing the new prices with those of last month, water increased by slightly less than three times, electricity by 1.2 to 3 times, gas by 1 to 2.6 times, telephone by 1.5 to 2.9 times, streetcars by an average of 2.3 times, buses by an average of 2.2 times, small trains by 1.8 times, and ferries by 2.4 times.</p>
<p>This time, the adjustment of new prices for Shanghai's public utilities was too high, which deeply stimulated the morale of the market and played a leading role in raising commodity prices. The Municipal Council has paid attention to this, and we feel that public utilities are closely related to the lives of all citizens, and everyone has the right to ask about them.</p>
<p>In terms of government measures, those related to stabilizing prices are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>First, President Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting at Mogan Mountain at the end of July to discuss and formulate a new economic reform plan. According to reports, the content of the plan includes emergency measures to stabilize prices in the first step, reforming foreign exchange policies to absorb overseas remittances and encourage exports in the second step, and reforming the currency system in the final step. Regarding price stabilization, it is rumored that the plan will involve merging financial institutions nationwide, conducting a general registration of banks and firms nationwide, raising capital, and ordering those that do not meet the regulations to close or merge. Currently, there are over 6,000 financial institutions nationwide, and after the merger, only one-third will remain.</p>
<p>Second, the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Financial Administration, Lin Chongyong, officially took office on the 2nd, stating: "The current financial situation has developed to an extremely abnormal state. The number of banks and firms is the highest in the world, and the malpractice is at its extreme. For example, the expenses of banks and firms even exceed their total deposits. If this continues, the harm will be unimaginable. If the banking law is not seriously implemented, it will endanger the entire country and society. There are also two ways to prevent this: (1) to distinguish between right and wrong, and (2) to distinguish between good and evil. Those with normal operations should be guaranteed, and those with poor operations should be eliminated." Judging from Lin's remarks, the government's trend of financial control will be strengthened in the future.</p>
<p>Third, according to the announcement of the US Aid Utilization Committee, as of July 31, the US aid materials that have been shipped to China include 42,674 long tons of rice, 8,929 long tons of flour, and 70,370 bales of cotton. It is also learned that the second batch of US aid cotton has also been approved by the US Economic Cooperation Administration. A total of US$33.7 million can be started immediately.</p>
<p>In addition, the Yarn Management Committee was previously ordered to abolish, and the various departments of the committee are rushing to complete the closure. From now on, merchants and factories will be free to purchase, transport, and sell domestic cotton, and will not be subject to any government control.</p>
<p>The commodity prices last week, due to the aforementioned reasons, were initially hesitant at the beginning and middle of the week due to the impending announcement of the new economic reform plan, but by the weekend, it seemed that they could no longer wait, and many rose to new highs. In terms of yarn and cloth, for example, 42-count Jianfeng rose from 2 billion at the beginning of the week to 2.42 billion at the weekend, 21-count Shuangma rose from 1.57 billion at the beginning of the week to 2 billion at the weekend, and Longtou fine cloth once broke the 70 million mark. Tianqiao silk rose from 2.22 billion at the beginning of the week to 2.77 billion at the weekend. The grain market, from Friday, was affected by the adjustment of transportation costs, with Shangbai rice rising to over 43 million, and oil and flour also following suit. It rose again at the weekend, with Baijing rice breaking the 50 million mark, all setting new prices. Other items such as daily necessities, chemicals, and metals also followed this trend, with prices setting new records after Friday. The Shanghai wholesale price index by usage is as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai wholesale price index by processing degree is as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai wholesale price index by country of production and sales is as follows:</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Black Market Interest Rate</p>
<p>Last week, the money supply in the city was extremely loose, even excessive. The main reasons for this can be summarized as follows: (1) The market was slightly stagnant due to rampant rumors (such as the economic reform plan), and the national banks and bureaus were able to take the opportunity to absorb large amounts of foreign exchange certificates and flour, and other materials. Coupled with other expenditures, the net outflow of funds from the banks and bureaus was more than 14 trillion yuan in five days from Monday to Friday. It is estimated that by the weekend, the city's floating capital had exceeded 50 trillion yuan, so the loose monetary policy was inevitable. (2) Remittances from various places poured in, especially from Tianjin and Qingdao. It is said that the daily remittances cleared amounted to as much as 2 trillion yuan, and at least 500 billion yuan. (3) Both buyers and sellers in the market adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the number of internal and external demand orders decreased significantly compared to before, resulting in an abundant supply of funds.</p>
<p>Although this situation of loose monetary policy is just one of the manifestations of malignant inflation, its severity is becoming more and more intensified. For example, the huge net outflow of funds from banks and bureaus, the rise in black market interest rates caused by high commodity prices, and the shrinking purchasing power of the people are all setting new records each time. The extreme looseness of monetary policy this time is clearly a prelude to another sharp rise in prices, which deserves our deep vigilance.</p>
<p>Last week, the black market interest rate was most commonly at five jiao and four fen, but before Wednesday, the highest reached above six jiao, even seven and a half jiao. After Thursday, due to the large outflows of funds from banks and bureaus and the loose monetary policy, the interest rate fell below five jiao, and on Friday, some were even offered at three jiao and nine fen. In addition, the interest rate on loans secured by goods also fell repeatedly over the week due to the shift from tight to loose monetary policy. For example, the interest rate on loans secured by cotton yarn plunged from 45 yuan on Monday to 15 yuan on Friday.</p>
<p>From Monday to Friday, the national banks and bureaus had a total net outflow of 142,687 billion yuan, an increase of six times or more than 118 trillion yuan compared to the previous week when the monetary policy was not so loose. It can be said that it set an unprecedented record for the net outflow of funds from banks and bureaus. What is even more serious is that the actual outflow of funds from banks and bureaus last week was actually more than this number. For example, on Tuesday, the banks and bureaus only allowed the use of transfer methods to offset bills of over 5,000 times the pre-war value. It can be seen that the above outflow figures were smaller than the actual outflow.</p>
<p>For commercial banks and firms, orders were generally abundant throughout the week, and funds became more and more abundant, making interbank lending difficult. The clearing results of banks and firms after number 60, from Monday to Friday, showed a total net inflow of 808.7 billion yuan, which included the 45,427 billion yuan outflow of the Taiwan Bank. Therefore, excluding this number, the actual net inflow of indirect clearing in five days reached 535,140 billion yuan, an increase of more than 680 billion yuan compared to the same period in the previous week. Such a huge increase in indirect clearing is also unprecedented, and the abundance of bank and firm funds is clearly evident.</p>
<p>As for foreign banks, from Monday to Friday last week, the total net inflow was 731,690 billion yuan, an increase of more than 400 billion yuan compared to the same period in the previous week. Without this huge inflow from foreign banks, it is conceivable that the looseness of monetary policy last week would have become a flood.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the domestic exchange rate fluctuated relatively smoothly. The Guangzhou exchange water was 350 yuan on Monday, increased to 400 yuan from Tuesday to Thursday, and then fell back to 300 yuan on Friday. The Xiamen exchange water was 500 yuan from Monday to Wednesday, fell to 400 yuan on Thursday, and then fell to 300 yuan on Friday. This may be a prelude to a change in demand, a decrease in the southern bandits, and a resurgence of rising prices. The Chongqing exchange water was 150 yuan before Thursday, and increased by 50 yuan to 200 yuan on Friday. The Wuhan exchange water was 180 yuan on Monday and Tuesday, increased to 200 yuan on Wednesday and Thursday, and then returned to 180 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin exchange rate remained flat throughout.</p>
<p>Last week, the foreign exchange market saw a sharp rise in the price of foreign exchange certificates due to rumors of a change in foreign exchange policy, a large number of import licenses being issued, and large-scale purchases by the authorities. For example, the asking price on Monday was 4.5 million, and it continued to rise to 6.4 million on Friday. Gold shops raised the listed price of gold ornaments to 430 million and 400 million yuan on Monday. On Tuesday, due to rumors of gold nationalization, it plummeted to 380 million and 340 million. Later, the rumors passed, and the price became firm again, returning to the high price of Monday on Friday. Last week, the Hong Kong Shanghai exchange was lengthened to eight fen in the first half of the week, but on Thursday, it began to shorten to seven fen Hong Kong dollars for 100,000 legal currency. Hong Kong US dollars were priced at 5 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen. Gold fell to 329 yuan per tael on Wednesday, and rose again to a high level of 332 yuan and 5 jiao on Thursday.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, rumors were rife, and bulls and bears each had their own advantages. The stock market fluctuated abnormally. Yong Yarn opened and immediately rose to the limit of 13,860 yuan. Yongye, Lianhua, Zhongxing, Zhabei, Zhonghuo, Cement, and other seven stocks also followed suit and rose to the limit. Later, negative news was rampant, and it suddenly泻. At the close in the afternoon, the overall increase and decrease were slightly higher than the previous weekend, with little fluctuation. The next day, due to the news of the new economic reform plan becoming more specific, major players waited and watched. Yong Yarn once fell to the limit, but finally closed at 11,800 yuan. Except for Yongye and Lianhua, which stood at the limit, the remaining stocks fell by about half. On Wednesday, it still did not escape the fatigue and entered a consolidation phase. As a result, Yong Yarn rose by 230 yuan and closed at 12,030 yuan, and the remaining stocks saw mixed gains and losses. Although the money supply loosened on Thursday, the buying side was still wary because the Financial Management Bureau dispatched a large number of people to inspect the financial market. The rise of each stock was not significant, and Yong Yarn rose to 12,750 yuan at the close. The trading of other stocks was sluggish, and the price increased slightly. Starting on Friday, due to being trapped in a state of fatigue for a long time, the market moved from stillness to activity. The banks and gold businesses competed to buy, and the trend gradually rose. After several consolidations in the afternoon, the market was particularly strong before the close. Yong Yarn, Zhonghuo, Zhongyi, Lianhua, and Yongye all rose to the limit. All other stocks, except for Mei Lin, also rose by between half and one and a half percent. At the weekend, due to rumors of currency reform in the new economic reform plan, it was believed that stocks with a large increase would fall, while those with a small increase would rise. This created a situation of cold rises and hot 泻. Yong Yarn closed at 13,980 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day. Zhonghuo, Zhongsi, Cement, Zhabei, Yongan, Commerce, and other cold stocks all saw gains.</p>
<h3>From the Business Arena to the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities have shown signs of adopting a so-called "hands-off" attitude towards certain measures in the industrial and commercial sectors. In some cases, too much control can suffocate industry and commerce, but in other cases, letting go can cause immeasurable harm to the industrial and commercial sectors. For example, the fact that public utilities have risen by two or three times in the past week has undoubtedly increased the burden on industry and commerce. According to the direct reason for the increase in public utility prices, the main point is that the companies are suffering too much loss, and they cannot be supported without raising prices. However, the crux of the problem is clearly as Chairman Zeng of the Municipal Council said at the "anti-price increase" panel meeting: First, the central government has no solution for the overall economy, finance, and finance, so prices continue to rise, and public utilities are no exception. Local governments can only treat the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt, so it is difficult to achieve stability. Second, the Municipal Council has repeatedly suggested to the central government that the foreign exchange required by public utilities be approved for settlement once every three months, and the fuel and coal required be allowed to be purchased once every three months, but the central government did not adopt it, which led to the serious situation today. Without asking whether the opposition to the increase in public utility prices by the more than sixty councilors this time will have a practical effect, one thing is obvious: the reason why public utility prices have repeatedly increased is the result of the authorities' "hands-off" approach, and the reason why the authorities do not adopt the so-called subsidy policy and are willing to let go, and are willing to be the target of public opinion, is because their cheap foreign exchange and their legal currency have long been used for other purposes!</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to save foreign exchange consumption only in public utilities related to people's livelihood. For example, the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee of the Central Bank also held its second meeting on Tuesday last week. It is said that the examination principle of the committee is still based on the government's policy of saving foreign exchange, and strict processing is carried out. Regarding the foreign exchange required for importers to import goods, it is still reviewed and determined by the Import and Export Management Committee. Not only that, the authorities have also spent a lot of effort considering the use of US aid materials that are about to arrive. According to reports, the government will suggest to the United States in this period that the currency recovered from the sale of aid to China materials should be used to balance the financial budget. According to Yan Jiaxin, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee, part of the proceeds from the sale will be frozen. This "free trade" policy of investing US aid materials in the black market market, in addition to achieving the purpose of "partially freezing legal currency," obviously a considerable part will be used to raise foreign exchange funds. It can be seen that for military needs, the government will inevitably do everything possible to save or hunt for foreign exchange, so it is not surprising that public utility prices will repeatedly increase. Furthermore, this time the decision to export US aid cotton to make yarn and import US aid fertilizer to exchange for grain, although it is said that foreign cotton can be purchased after exporting cotton to make yarn, it will naturally earn more foreign exchange in a blink of an eye. As for whether the yarn price will rise sharply due to foreign transportation, the authorities seem to be unable to take care of it. Fertilizers can be converted into grain imports. In addition to "reducing the issuance of currency to promote grain production," it will naturally also directly help the war.</p>
<p>Regarding the partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange, it has also become a hot topic of discussion in the public opinion and industrial and commercial circles in the past week. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Industrial Association convened a symposium for people in the industrial sector on Tuesday last week. On Thursday afternoon, the Import and Export Association invited people from the industrial sector, scholars, and representatives of the Import and Export Management Committee to hold a similar symposium. We only need to refer to the opinions of Chen, Director of the Export Promotion Department of the Import and Export Management Committee in the meeting, and we can clearly see the painstaking efforts of the political diseases to promulgate this method. Chen believes that the funds of Chinese people abroad can be taken into account for investing in raw materials in the country. However, it seems unreasonable to turn raw materials into finished products, turn them into legal currency funds, and then go abroad to purchase raw materials. Obviously, after raw materials are turned into finished products, turned into legal currency, and then go abroad to purchase raw materials, the government cannot increase its foreign exchange income due to the return of overseas Chinese capital. Although this approach is beneficial to the industrial and commercial sectors and production, is this the government's biggest goal! The Secretary-General of the Import and Export Management Committee said more sharply: "The reason why this method is announced is straightforwardly to hope to import the equipment and raw materials lacking in the country without spending the country's foreign exchange... At the same time, we must pay more attention to how to give these factories a way out for the finished products they produce after they resume work, and not to obtain black market foreign exchange." Obviously, there are two things in the authorities' minds about the "way out for the finished products": First, for the government to purchase, and second, to sell the foreign exchange certificates obtained after the finished products are exported to the government. This is of course a calculation to enrich foreign exchange funds. In a word, modern warfare requires the consumption of huge amounts of foreign exchange!</p>
<p>It is said that a large part of the unprecedented outflow of funds from the national banks and bureaus in the past week was the price paid by the authorities for purchasing foreign exchange certificates and flour and other materials in large quantities. This can't help but remind people of the various rumors in the market over the past ten days and the whereabouts of the large banknotes issued. Whether the negative rumors have stabilized the market temporarily, and then batches of large banknotes are released and batches of materials are brought in, if it is unfortunate and so, I am afraid that another storm for the industrial and commercial sectors is not far away.</p>
<p>The business arena is not only like a "battlefield," but it is not difficult to see that the roads of the business arena are closely linked to the cruel battlefield!</p>
<h3>Prospects for the New Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>— Cai Runlan</p>
<p>When we talk about the new economic reform plan, we can't help but think of the "old" economic reform plan that passed away not long ago. Since the restoration, the things that can be mentioned in this regard include the economic emergency measures during Premier Song Ziwen's time. As the name suggests, this was a relatively temporary measure, so let's not bother with it. Later, during Premier Zhang Qun's time, the National Economic Commission was established under the Executive Yuan, and it passed the economic reform plan in one go, with great ambitions to revitalize the country. The plan at that time included three major goals: finance, production and construction, and finance, involving the reorganization of national banks, the establishment of sound county banks, the construction of agriculture, industry, commerce, and transportation, the management of finance, and the stabilization of currency value, and was ultimately full of optimism. The conclusion stated: "In short, production undertakings cannot be without the nourishment of finance for a day, and financial income cannot be without the support of production undertakings for a day. Financial policy, economic policy, and fiscal policy are mutually cause and effect, and complement each other, and cannot be separated for a moment. As for what is stated in this plan, those that have been implemented by the government but have not yet shown results should be strengthened by the competent ministries and commissions: those that should be implemented immediately and prepared for implementation should be distributed by the Executive Yuan to the competent ministries and commissions to properly formulate detailed measures and implement them quickly. Secondly, there are three points that should be paid special attention to in order for this plan to be promoted smoothly:</p>
<p>(1) To reasonably solve the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers, so that they can maintain the minimum necessary living conditions, so that administrative efficiency can be improved. (2) State-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be on an equal footing, and there should be no discrimination, and no private enterprise should be given special treatment, which would increase the difficulties of legitimate private undertakings. (3) In the social aspect, a broad economic construction movement should be launched to improve the public's understanding and interest in the economy, and to use the power of cooperation between officials and the people to overcome the difficulties of economic construction. If the above reform measures can be carried out in coordination, the current phenomena of production stagnation, soaring prices, depletion of tax sources, and imbalance of revenue and expenditure can be changed immediately. Then, there will be many who produce and few who consume, those who work will be diligent, and those who use will be generous, so wealth will always be sufficient, and the crisis of fiscal economy can be saved."</p>
<p>This reform plan was beautifully written, as for its achievements, there is no need to review them, the facts will speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the production side, what we heard was that there was a shortage of raw materials, excessive control, and production institutions were fleeing to Hong Kong one after another. Regarding prices, according to the wholesale price index compiled by the China General Chamber of Commerce, as of the first week of August this year, it was 5,177,864 times. Regarding tax sources and revenue and expenditure, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu publicly reported on June 16 that this year's May revenue was 15 trillion yuan, and expenditure was 75 trillion yuan, with revenue only one-fifth of expenditure. Now, even the National Economic Commission, the institution originally designed, has been explicitly abolished. Who will cash in this plan?</p>
<p>This time, Premier Weng Wenhao's new economic reform plan has only been heard of, but has not been seen. The details are not yet officially announced. However, according to a partial report, "The new economic reform plan drafted by the Weng Cabinet was discussed by President Chiang with relevant personnel at Mogan Mountain on the 30th and 31st of last month, and after making decisions on various issues in principle, the Executive Yuan will formulate implementation steps according to the new plan and announce them in stages according to their nature. According to official sources, the first step of the plan is to focus on emergency measures to stabilize prices, which will be first submitted to the political affairs meeting on the 4th for discussion. If approved, it can be announced and implemented on the 5th. The next step is to reform the foreign exchange policy, absorb overseas remittances, and encourage exports. The final step is to reform the monetary system. As for the timing of the implementation of other steps, it will be determined according to the effect of stabilizing prices and the actual environment at that time."</p>
<p>Now we come to criticize the new economic reform plan, because it has not yet been officially announced, it seems to lack a basis, but stabilizing prices, managing foreign exchange, and reforming the monetary system are indeed the main issues in the current economic problems. Let's talk about it for now.</p>
<p>Stabilizing prices is already an old topic. The key is whether the government's revenue and expenditure can be balanced? If there is an imbalance, what can be done to make up for it? Can the issuance of currency be frozen? On the issue of details, such as the treatment of civil servants and teachers, it should be improved in principle. The authorities have to set up institutions such as the Bandit Suppression Committee in order to cope with the government environment, which are difficult problems to solve.</p>
<p>Speaking of foreign exchange management, in order to attract overseas remittances, the government must at least pay the exchange rate of overseas remittances equal to the black market price of foreign exchange, but does this reflect the further devaluation of the legal currency? Stimulate prices to rise further? In addition, how can we create a good environment in the country to allow overseas remittances to continue to invest? Encouraging exports is not a simple issue either. Has the government made up its mind not to care about the foreign exchange of exporters and let them develop freely? The competition in overseas markets and the rise of Japan are already a serious problem that the authorities are reluctant to discuss. Furthermore, is foreign aid free? How should "reciprocity" be studied in trade?</p>
<p>Finally, there is the reform of the monetary system. We don't have much to say about this issue. Let's just say casually that changing 20 yuan of legal currency into one yuan of customs gold is not also a reform of the monetary system? Why bother to discuss it so much?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new," when we think of a series of question marks about the current economic problems and the achievements of Premier Zhang Qun's economic reform plan, are we optimistic or pessimistic, trusting or skeptical about the future of Premier Weng's new economic reform? Let's wait! Let's wait for Premier Weng's miracle to give us the answer.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Championship Schedule Completely Arranged China is Placed in the Third Division Today's First Game is Against Switzerland</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The most intense event of this year's World Games is the basketball competition, especially the five teams in the second group's round-robin tournament, whose wins and losses are uncertain and changes are complicated, presenting an unprecedented chaos. As a result, five teams ended up with the same record, each with three wins and two losses. The officials of the Chinese delegation did not understand the competition rules and were finally unfairly ranked fifth, which is a pity. The ranking finals have already begun on Saturday of last week and will continue today, and the rankings of all 23 countries will be determined. The rankings of each group and the schedule of the three divisions are listed below:</p>
<p>First Division Championship</p>

However, in any case, the world knows that although China is placed in the third division, Korea in the first division and Belgium in the second division were both defeated by China, which is also a source of consolation. The basketball competition system is still not ideal and has many shortcomings, which is obvious. China's first game today will be against Switzerland.</p>
<p>Second Group Rankings</p>
<p>The mystery of the rankings in the second group has finally been revealed. China is actually ranked fifth. According to the announcement by the World Games authorities, it is based on the 14th World Games basketball competition rules established by the International Amateur Basketball Association. The calculation method of the average score of each team is limited to the record between the teams with the same accumulated points. The record against Iraq is not included.

<h3>We Are Not Discouraged Did Not Lose Face in Front of Strong Enemies Shi Zhaokang Talks to Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, July 7] Shi Zhaokang, the secretary of the Chinese World Games delegation, told our reporter today: "Please tell our friends in Shanghai that the Chinese World Games team did not lose face in front of strong enemies. As for victory, we did not expect it beforehand." After smiling bitterly, Shi said, "After the wheels of sports in China turn, one day we will be able to win first place." Shi was not discouraged by the misfortune that the Chinese soccer team, track and field athletes, and the only swimming athlete were not selected. Qu explained: "The Chinese soccer team encountered one of the best teams in Europe. The swimming athlete was eliminated by a hair's breadth in one of the best groups in the preliminaries. Chen Yinglang was also eliminated by a few inches in the 400-meter preliminaries. In the 10,000-meter race, Lou Wenao ranked 17th out of 30 athletes from various countries. Ten of the thirty people failed to complete the race. If Chinese track and field can start training now, it should have brilliant results at the next World Games in 1952. The instability of the general situation in China and the inadequacy of sports facilities show that the results we have achieved in London are not bad. The Chinese basketball team's defeat of Belgium and Korea is a sign of future glory. Please tell the people of the country that we will never be discouraged and will continue to do our best to win glory for our country."</p>

<h3>Two Proverbs</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>I have sporadically read some foreign articles criticizing the Chinese people, and I feel that the criticism outweighs the praise. Among them, Bertrand Russell loved the Chinese the most. He once said something like this: Even if the civilizations of England and America are destroyed, as long as China exists, the world will still have civilization. However, Russell's high praise of China was criticized by Lu Xun, who believed it was intended to numb and was ill-intentioned. Lu Xun's observation of the Chinese people was profound, ranking among the best in the era, and his conclusion was pessimistic, if not desperate.</p>
<p>To study the Chinese people! Such a large and ancient nation, how dare I? However, we often hear and see two common proverbs. If these words are spoken for a reason, then one cannot help but sigh at the Chinese people. The two proverbs are:</p>
<p>When well-fed and warm, one thinks of lust; when hungry and cold, one contemplates theft.</p>
<p>Think about it, being human in this world is nothing more than being either well-fed and warm or hungry and cold. Now, if one is hungry and cold, one will contemplate theft, and if one is well-fed and warm, one will think of lust. Neither is good, so isn't this a great flaw? Even if China enjoys favorable weather, abundant harvests, or gold everywhere, easily picked up, and 390 million out of 400 million people are well-fed and warm, with only 10 million hungry and cold, the situation is not beautiful. This is because, although those who contemplate theft only account for an absolute minority, social order would inevitably be disrupted. Moreover, if lustful people are everywhere in the country, what would become of national morality? Wouldn't the issue of public morals be serious? Conversely, if there are more hungry and cold people and fewer well-fed and warm people, the situation would be even more unthinkable.</p>
<p>I hope that these two proverbs are just nonsense, or at least cannot be generalized. However, given the facts before us, these words are not spoken without reason, especially the first sentence. Since the national crisis, the number of people who have made fortunes is not small. Their being well-fed and warm is undoubtedly beyond question. However, have they contributed even a little to the nation and society? They haven't even done a bit of good deeds like providing tea or medicine to the needy. Why is that? Is it that the more well-fed and warm they become, the more lustful and sensual they become, spending their days rotating between being well-fed and lustful, oblivious to the existence of the country, society, the world, and humanity?</p>
<p>Moreover, if the first sentence of these two proverbs is close to the truth, then there is a danger that the second sentence will also be promoted and realized. Gold has never been everywhere in China. Well-fed and warm people only think of lust. After lust, they will inevitably think more about being well-fed and warm. Hunger and cold will then become widespread among the people, and the desire for theft will become rampant, eventually becoming like a prairie fire, unstoppable.</p>
<p>I worry about China's fate thinking about these two proverbs.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemums in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>Peiping is the birthplace of Peking Opera, and once gathered famous performers, reaching its peak. Now, times have changed, and it is not what it used to be. Here is a description of the situation in recent months.</p>
<p>Theaters: Before the Anti-Japanese War, Peking Opera theaters were spread throughout the southern, eastern, and western parts of the city. There were only a few cinemas, such as Ping An and Zhen Guang. Now, there are more cinemas than Peking Opera theaters. Zhonghe, Qingle, Xin Xin, and other theaters have all been converted to showing movies. Jixiang Garden and Guangde Lou have also been converted to Ping Opera. The only theaters that still perform Peking Opera are Chang An, Hua Le, Municipal (formerly Kai Ming), San Qing, and Hua Bei. Among them, Hua Bei only performs for training classes, and major performers do not perform there. Among these few theaters, Chang An Theater has a suitable location (on West Chang An Avenue), beautiful architecture, and a spacious venue. Many famous performers take turns performing there, but Tan Fuying performs at Hua Le and San Qing theaters.</p>
<p>Troupes: Although ticket sales are not good, there are more troupes instead. They include: (1) Shang Xiaoyun and Xiao Cuihua; (2) Xun Huisheng; (3) Tan Fuying; (4) Li Shaochun; (5) Ye Sheng Lan; (6) Ye Shengzhang; (7) Qiu Shengrong; (8) Yang Baosen; (9) Zhang Junqiu, Ye Shengxi; and Chu Shilai. There are also three female troupes: Xu Dongming (Laosheng), Wu Sifeng (Huadan), and Liang Suiming (Laosheng). In addition, there are also temporary troupes that cannot be listed. Ye Sheng Lan with Xiaosheng, Ye Shengzhang with Wusheng, and Qiu Shengrong with Hualian, each formed a troupe, performed main acts, and became headliners, creating a new situation, which was rare in the past.</p>
<p>Ticket Sales of Shang Xiaoyun: Shang Xiaoyun and Xiao Cuihua have a good reputation in Peiping. Now, they have collaborated to form a troupe, which is enough to attract audiences. Ticket sales are still not bad, but ticket prices are very low. Recently, the best seats only cost 800,000 (in mid-July, only 600,000) per person, which is less than two jiao compared to the pre-war value. The rest range from 500,000 to 600,000. It is considered good if ticket sales are more than 50% of capacity. It is no longer possible to see people rushing to buy tickets and filling the theater. This has led to the following situations: (1) In the past, it was impossible to get good seats without regularly giving favors and tips to the ushers. Now, anyone can get them by giving the ticket seller an extra 100,000 to 150,000. (2) The main performers know that it is difficult to sell out the theater, so they ask people to sell tickets in advance, calling them "red tickets." These red tickets, if priced at 500,000, are secretly sold for only 300,000. If they can sell them for more than 300,000, then the excess is the commission for the seller. A new practice of bargaining has gradually developed between ticket buyers and sellers. (3) There are also tickets that cannot be sold, such as complimentary tickets for military and police agencies, seats for veterans, and the front-of-house tea room, which invite customers to fill unsold seats after the main act starts, charging a tea fee and a small tip as their allowance.</p>
<p>Supporting Roles: All troupes lack good supporting roles. Shang Xiaoyun's troupe does not have a second-tier Laosheng. Tan Fuying's troupe does not have a good Huashan. This diminishes the appeal of many good plays. Some good plays require a large number of supporting roles, making it impossible to perform them. Only a few plays are performed repeatedly, which is boring. Moreover, because the supporting roles are paid too little, they are not very motivated, just going through the motions, making the performances less and less exciting.</p>
<p>Training Classes: Currently, only Shang Xiaoyun's Rongchun Society performs at Hua Bei Theater. The former Fuliancheng, Binqing, and other societies, as well as the Opera School, have all been closed for a long time.</p>
<p>In short, in Peiping, which is plagued by economic hardship and banditry, it is difficult for ordinary people to make a living. The once prosperous singing and dancing scene has become a thing of the past. Recalling the time twenty years ago when Yang, Yu, and Mei competed for supremacy, and the veteran performer Chen Dejun, also known as Yunfu, occasionally performed in charity shows, and the other famous performers, who were too numerous to count, one truly feels that "this music should only exist in heaven."</p>
<h3>The Freest Prison in the World</h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>A Mexican man and his family had just finished a meal at a restaurant. As he and his wife and children walked onto the sidewalk, he said, "The time for meeting this week is over. Let's go back together—Dad has to go back to prison."</p>
<p>This is the life of an ordinary prisoner in a large prison in Mexico. Mexican prisons are the freest prisons in the world, always adhering to the principle of minimizing interference with prisoners' freedom. Prisoners can not only take their families out to eat but also continue to engage in trade or business. The law guarantees that prisoners receive the same wages as ordinary people.</p>
<p>Inside the Mexico City prison, daily necessities are available for sale. A prisoner opened a grocery store, and people flock to buy things every day because they know the store does business honestly. The store's sign often reads: "Refund if not satisfied" or "Ten-year-old store."</p>
<p>Along "Prison Street" are shops such as hat shops, clothing stores, barbershops, and shoe repair shops, all offering good prices and quality, and flourishing. In addition, there are also fairly good card printing shops and jewelry stores.</p>
<p>One prisoner is a lawyer who specializes in writing letters for the illiterate and petitioning the High Court for his fellow inmates. A notice is posted on the door of his prison office: "Time is money—please don't waste my time."</p>
<p>Another feature of this prison is that children can live with female inmates. When a mother is imprisoned, her children do not have to leave because prison officials believe that the presence of children will encourage female inmates to improve themselves. At the same time, the authorities strive to ensure that the children brought into the prison are not harmed. In the women's prison, we can see mothers walking back and forth on the main road with their children. Along both sides of the road are rows of rooms (these prison cells are large and furnished, with flowers and trees planted outside), with the doors open. There are also small schools near each prison, where children can be sent to study.</p>
<p>Outside the school is a large building where children can spend their time. From seven in the morning until bedtime, they play there. At the same time, they also eat, bathe, play ball, and so on... Everything is no different from ordinary social life.</p>
<p>Another feature of Mexican prisons is that they do not prohibit sexual activity. A married man can have his wife come in and stay with him. For this purpose, they usually have private rooms separate from the ordinary prison cells.</p>
<p>Unmarried men can also invite girlfriends to visit, but prostitutes are not allowed. A woman is only allowed to visit one male prisoner. Often, older people accompany unmarried women.</p>
<p>According to Mexican law, 40% of a prisoner's income should be given to the victim of the prisoner's crime. For example, a murderer sentenced to life imprisonment must give nearly half of his income to the victim's family. Thirty percent of the income supports the prisoner's own family, and the remaining 30% is saved.</p>
<p>In addition, anyone entering a Mexican prison must receive compulsory education. Each prison has an attached school. Prisoners with higher education serve as teachers.</p>
<h3>A Mistake in Mr. Tang Wei's Recording</h3>
<p>— Gao Junbin</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Wei's complete set of ten reading recording discs was produced and circulated by the Dayouhua Record Factory in this city. The current factory director, Mr. Fan Shizheng, was my classmate at Nanyang University. This action is commendable for enriching the art world and benefiting the national essence. Mr. Wei's reading method, with its intonation, pauses, high and low pitches, fast and slow tempos, and moving voice, has its own profound principles. My father heard it and liked it, so he asked me to buy a set. After listening carefully, I discovered that in the tenth disc, the sixth line of Tang Ruoqin's (Mr. Wei's late father) Spring Festival poem, "Peach branches hang drums and paint tigers," the "drum" character in "hang drums" seems to be a mistake for the "talisman" character. So, I inquired with Mr. Wei, who replied in a letter: "Mr. Chuiwan is insightful. The 'drum' in my late father's Spring Festival poem is indeed a mistake for the 'talisman' character. Because there is no manuscript of this poem, I only relied on my memory to recite it, so I dared not change it. The error has been perpetuated for decades. Fortunately, you have corrected it, and I am extremely grateful." From this, we can see that Mr. Wei had long suspected the difference in the character. Now, after discussing it with my father, he believes that the error can indeed be corrected. How admirable is his humility and respect! I record these few words to share with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Furthermore, Han Painted Fans</h3>
<h3>Under the Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Master Huang Binhong flew south from the old capital and settled by the lake. When passing through Shanghai, Ba Lin hosted a banquet for him in the art world, inviting Sanmu, Kongwo, Bai Jiao, Tang Yun, Gong Yu, and Buhou to drink with him. The old master spoke eloquently, and all those present listened attentively. Master Huang has an old residence, but it is in ruins and cannot be returned to.</p>
<p>Loose cloth and wide sleeves, genuine rustic charm,</p>
<p>Profound explanations, ears refreshed with new ideas.</p>
<p>Under the lamp, shadows float like the sea,</p>
<p>Who are the peers of the Tongguang era?</p>
<p>White pagoda, red walls, ancient surroundings,</p>
<p>Sloping streets, flower scenes all gone.</p>
<p>Lying high for ten years, no intention to return?</p>
<p>Bringing back the chaos of Yanyun after the war.</p>
<p>Empty fishing bay in the daytime,</p>
<p>Imagining seclusion in dreams!</p>
<p>Returning to West Lake in old age, still a guest,</p>
<p>Barriers of war, distant Huangshan.</p>
<p>The alley is desolate, the moon is the lamp,</p>
<p>Autumn arrives on the mountains, adding desolation.</p>
<p>No more recruitment halls in the pine pavilion,</p>
<p>Striking up residence with the whole family in Ma Lu.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>I praised Mr. Wu Lie's article on currency reform, his words were clear and insightful, revealing the core issues. The principles are consistent throughout history, worthy of reference. (Mr. Gongming, from Piaoyang, rose from a successful candidate in the imperial examination to the position of magistrate, eventually serving as the transport commissioner of Jin-Qu Road in Zhejiang. During the Gengshen year, he defended Hangzhou and died in battle.) The full text includes a section specifically on inflation, citing three major causes of the failure of paper money: "promiscuous issuance," "triviality," and "frequent changes."</p>
<p>He said that with paper money as currency, it is easy to issue it. Because it is easy to issue, the amount increases daily, and if it increases, its value decreases, and if its value decreases, circulation is hindered. Good for Yelü Chucai's words to Yuan Shizu, "The officials of the Jin Dynasty considered issuing paper money as a profit, and considered collecting paper money as a taboo, to the point where ten thousand strings of cash were exchanged for one cake! Now, making paper money should be standardized in units of ten thousand ingots. Once there is a fixed format and limit, there will be no previous problems." By the middle of the Yuan Dynasty, the issuance of paper money increased greatly, rewarding foreign monks with twenty million strings, and the paper money system deteriorated again. This is the flaw of "promiscuous issuance." Yuan paper money had eleven denominations from fifty to one thousand. Paper money is intended to supplement coins. If it makes its own denominations, it will cause vendors to only know how to use paper, and there will be no coins in the world. When the paper money system fails, wealth will inevitably become trivial, which is the flaw of "triviality." The paper money system must be credible to be sustainable. Because of the failure of the paper money system, instead of deeply considering the reasons for the failure, new paper money is issued, and new paper money is used to exchange old paper money. Orders are reversed repeatedly, causing confusion among the people. As the new and old accumulate, the paper money system becomes more hindered, which is the flaw of "frequent changes." Knowing the flaws is necessary before discussing paper money, and knowing the flaws is necessary before using paper money.</p>
<p>The above "three flaws" can clarify the source of the disease; the "two knowledges" show the way to start treating the disease. (Knowing the flaws is necessary before discussing, knowing the flaws is necessary before using.) These are truly concise and essential words. As for paper money, with good systems and good usage, it is originally a good method, convenient for carrying, facilitating use, and regulating finance and activating the economy, such as the Jiaozi of the Song Dynasty, the Baochao of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, and the Qiantie of the Qing Dynasty. But bad practices arise over time, often leading to harm to the people and the country, which also has its reasons: (1) It is abuse, such as during the Jin and Yuan dynasties, when it was used as a source of profit for extravagance, becoming a disguised form of tyrannical taxation; (2) It is expediency, such as during the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty, which was a severe period of confrontation with the Taiping army. Provinces fell, and financial resources were lacking, while military and administrative expenses were urgently needed, making it necessary to find a solution from "currency." The former was man-made, the latter was due to circumstances.</p>
<p>The solutions at that time: (1) was to take advantage of coins, increasing the weight and expanding the size of one Wen coin, making it "ten," "fifty," "hundred," and "five hundred," but the added copper was far less than these multiples. Lacking substance, it could not achieve practical results, only disrupting commerce and the market. (During the early years of the Republic of China, the "large copper coins" manufactured locally by the warlords of Sichuan resembled the Xianfeng large coins.) The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Chongshi, Zhao Guang, successively reported the severe difficulties of the people's livelihood, and the Xianfeng Emperor immediately ordered them to be stopped. Xianfeng "Dang Wushi" coins can still be occasionally seen at antique stalls, which were left over from that time. (2) was to replace coins with paper. According to Luo Wen Zhong's Chronicle, when he was the governor of Hunan, he received 80,000 taels of paper money from the Ministry of Revenue to distribute as salaries. The financial commissioner asked how to handle it. Luo said, "One Dangbai coin still contains 1.45 Qian of copper and cannot be used, so how can paper the size of a foot be used as three taels of silver! This paper money can only be kept in the treasury."</p>
<p>The current inflation has various "external" and "internal" causes and is more complex than in the past. It is necessary to consider both international and post-war situations in various countries. However, the principles described in this article can still be learned from, so I will briefly analyze and explain them.</p>
