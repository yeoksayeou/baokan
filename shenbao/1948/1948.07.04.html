<h3>中美雙邊協定公布　適用範圍限於經濟援助　有效期至後年六月底止</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕關於運用美援之中美雙邊協定，三日午後在外部二樓會客室中簽字，三時一刻我方代表王世杰外長及美方代表司徒雷登大使比肩坐長案前，在鎂光閃鑠中同時開始於協定之兩正本上簽字，司使於中文約本中仍依例簽署其中文姓氏，兩正本交換簽字畢，王外長與司使相互握手致意，並與全體在塲中美官員合影留念，旋各簡短致詞。王外長首表示，渠對雙邊協定得如期簽訂，深覺欣慰，復讚譽美使館人員於談判期間之合作精神。並稱：中國政府及人民均衷心感謝美國之援助，決心努力推行自助工作。司徒大使則宣讀其書面談話（見後），旣畢，賴普漢亦致詞謂：美國經濟合作總署執行長霍夫曼，極關心援華工作之進行，今雙邊協定及時簽字，深盼以後雙方能密切合作，以發揮美援之最大效果。簽字禮全部歷時僅十餘分鐘，儀式及布置均極簡潔，令人憶及去歲中美救濟協定及中美海軍協定在同一會客室中簽字之相類情形。司使於救濟協定簽字時，曾稱：「此僅為援助之開端」，雙邊協定規定之美援當為其再續。此會客室迨將成為記載中美友誼之史蹟。三日參與簽字儀式觀禮者，計有我外部政次劉師舜，條約司長胡慶育，帮辦汪孝熙，美洲司長董霖，帮辦陳世材，禮賓司長沈昌煥，情報司長時昭瀛，帮辦周書楷，美大使館公使克拉克，商務參贊麥堅義，秘書博仁傑·梅爾　，美國經濟合作總署駐華代表賴普漢，及其特別助理巴德曼。（中美雙邊協定全文刋第二版）</p>
<p>〔中央社甫京三日電〕三日下午簽署之中美雙邊協定，其內容與美國及歐洲受援國家所訂雙邊協定大體一致。其適用範圍則限於美援四億美元中之經濟援助部分二億七千五百萬美元。至軍事援助部份一億二千五百萬美元，則另案辦理。本協定有效期至卅九年六月底為止。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕中美雙邊協定及其附件與換文，三日正式公布，王外長並發表聲明，闡釋此次美援之要點，協定全文計十二條，規定四億美元中之經濟援助部份之運用事宜，及我國因之美承其之義務。「附件」中則列舉對協定中若干條文之了解。「換文」中則係關於西德及晚里斯脫自由區商品貿易，在一九五〇年底前，應享國際曁關稅貿易總協定所載最惠國待遇之規定。協定有效期至一九五〇年六月卅日止，即自本年四月，至明年三月十二個月美援運用定期完畢後，仍繼續有效十五個月。</p>
<h3>對整個美援問題　王部長概括說明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕外交部王部長三日代表我國簽訂美援協定，除將協定及其附件全文發表外，並對整個美授問題，作下列之槪括說明：</p>
<p>（一）美國國會此次決定援華款項之總額為四億美元。</p>
<p>（二）美國此次援華之目的，依其國會法案所明示，在協助中國政府穩定國內經濟及早日建立國內和平。</p>
<p>（三）美國國會所決定之援華四億美元，分為經濟援助及特種援助兩種。經濟援助為二億七千五百萬美元，特種援助為一億二千五百萬美元。</p>
<p>（四）本日所簽訂之中美雙邊協定及其附件，係僅以上述經濟援助為其適用範圍。此項雙邊協定之內容與美國曁歐洲受援國所訂雙邊協定之內容，大體一致。茲將中美雙邊協定內容要點列下：</p>
<p>（甲）協定未規定此項援助款項之償還。依照彼此了解，此項經濟援助款項，除其中一小部份用於特種建設事業者，將來或須另議償還辦法外，其餘概為贈與性質。</p>
<p>（乙）此項款額係預定供十二個月之用（即自本年四月三日起至中華民國卅八年四月三日止），至於本協定條文之有效期間，係訂為自簽字日至中華民國卅九年六月卅日。</p>
<p>（丙）美國政府對於上述贍與款項，保有中止撥付之種。</p>
<p>（丁）中國須採取可能的措施以利用本國資源及國民財力，發展工業及農業，改進財政幣制，减少貿易障碍，增進對外商業關係等。中國對於美國所缺少及中國所能轍出之物品，應依公平交易方式，予美國以採購之便利。中國政府對於一切關於美援之事實，有使中國民衆充分明瞭之責任。</p>
<p>（戊）由美援物資脫售而得之國幣，應如何處置，須經中美雙方代表之協議。處理之方式約為：（一）凍結（即收回法幣以安定金融與物價），（二）供若千種工礦鐵路建設及農村復與等工作之用。</p>
<p>（五）特種援助一億二千五百萬美元，係另案辦理。美國政府業將該項援助款項撥付手續通知我駐美大使，本部已訓令我駐美大使於七月二日照復同意。該款即可動用。該款之使用期問為十二個月。此款司作軍需之用，未附任何條件，其性質為贈與的。　以上為美援協定之內容。至於美援兩項目的「協助中國穩定經濟及早日建立國內和平」之達成，一方面需要中美兩方負責執行人員之竭誠合作，一方面仍寄於吾人今後在自助方面所為之努力</p>
<h3>美大使談話　切望增強友誼</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕美大使司徒雷等，於中美雙邊協定簽字後，發表談話如次：「余對中美兩國令日簽訂雙邊協定，甚感滿意。備知美國人民，亦必深感滿意。按諸協定，美國同意協助中國從事恢復正常生活之鬥爭，蓋連年戰禍已使此種生活遭受破壞一。美國人民充分了解中國在吾人對抗日本之共同鬥爭中，所作巨大之犧牲。美國人民且充分了解，世界任何一地為暴動不寗，或則任何民族如不能有求取適當生活之機會，俾於世界上獲得其自尊之地位，則殊無公正及持久和平之希望。美國人民希望協助中國人民自發自助，達到和平繁榮與人類尊嚴之地位，吾人切望此一協定，在友誼及合作之聯繫上，將為另一强固恒久之一環，此種友誼與合作，向為中美關係卓越之表徵。</p>
<h3>平津開放申匯　昨會出數甚少</h3>
<p>國行三要員內返滬</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕國行三要員在平與傅作義會商撤銷停兌流通券及限制東北匯款提現，今日可有結果，下週可恢復舊辦法，即二億以下匯款可自由提取，此外並準備以布換察綏雜糧。三氏不再赴東北，明後日返滬覆命。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平三日電〕平市銀行於三日開放申匯後，各銀行接受之申匯款額總計不過三百億，為數甚少。據金融界權威分析原因稱：（一）現鈔缺乏，（二）今日適値週末，星期日未能提現，（三）滬市塲已受當局嚴厲管制，投機不易。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津三日電」津申匯三日正式開放，中央銀行津分行公佈匯率牌價七十元，實匯按照牌價八折計算，三日係週六，匯出甚少。</p>
<h3>法幣印刷費質詢　財部將轉請央行於五日內答覆</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕立院財金委會三日會中，立委簡貢三曾向列席之央行發行局長梁平提出質詢：（一）外傳法幣每張之印刷費需美金八分五厘，合法幣卅四萬元，是否確實？（二）外傳印製法幣時有人從中索取手續費，有無其事？（四）法幣發行之程序如何？最後決定權操於何人？梁局長當即提出復謂：法幣印刷費決無外傳之高，發行則須呈奉總裁核准。簡委員對於梁之答復表示不滿，最後徐次長柏園起立稱，以上三項詢問，將由財政部轉請央行於五日內提出答復。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京三日電〕中國在美所印法幣，印費如以黑市折合法幣，每紙當達法幣四萬元。據財次徐柏園稱：在美所印某版法幣，每千紙需美金九元四角五分，較廉者每千紙亦需美金五元五角。</p>

<h3>立院財政金融委會決定　原則贊成改革幣制　定八日上午再行開會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕立法院財政金融委員會，三日上午舉行會議，審查顧鶴皐等所提設立法幣發行管理委員會，當靜岩等提請政府從速實現改革幣制等兩項提案。由劉健羣主席，財次徐柏園及央行發行局局長梁平等均列席說明及備諮詢。討論結果，主席歸納各委員意兄為如下三點：（一）法幣發行管理委員會，均認為有成立必要，至如何成立，尙待商討，（二）是否應立即停止發行，各委員意見尙未一致，須再加研討。（三）改革幣制在原則上無人反對，但是否應由立院先制定原則，限期授權政府辦理，亦須從詳研究。並定八日晨九時再舉行財政·傘融委員會，重加討論。</p>
<p>徐柏園報告</p>
<p>三日上午會中，首由原提案人說明，繼即由徐柏園報吿：（一）關於法幣發行管理：政府於廿四年實施法幣之日起，即成立法幣發行準備管理委員會，總會設於上海，另於天津·英口，廣州成立有分會，負費檢查準備金數字，及檢查發行數字，惟至抗戰開始，工　已漸停頓，至廿八年即正式停止，其補救辦法為另訂鞏固金融辦法。廿八年十月，並成立四聯理事會，由四聯總處兼負檢查發行實任，以迄勝利之時為止。關於法幣發行數字是否公布問題，政府曾數次討論，但無具體決定。因如公布發行數字，對經濟穩定有良好影響，固應公布，有時又恐公布後，反足以刺激物價，現在法幣發行之所以不得不增加者，一因稅收减少，一因支出浩繁，現總預算已在立法院審查中，如立院覺支出中有不當者，自可加以核减，惟增加收入則必須整頓稅收，現財部已有聲頓稅收案四件送請立院討論，希望能予以順利通過，以便實行。至改革幣制問題，自勝利起即加研究，迄現在尙無具體決定，此非政府過份考慮，實因幣制不改革則已，一改革即應一勞永逸，不可一改再改。其次，改革幣制應有充份準備，可能採取改革準備有三：（一）外匯，（二）實物，（三）硬幣，但現均無充分準備，自不能賀然從事。徐氏特別提出蘇聯此次改革幣制及過去美國改革幣制時均未經議會討論，美國即係總統辦理，中國如欲改革幣制，亦應授權政府辦理，以免討論時影響物價。</p>
<p>各立委意見</p>
<p>徐氏報告畢，劉振東，周雍能，王孟餘等紛紛發言，劉反對公開發行數字，並主張成立法幣發行管理委會。王主張馬上應停止發行，改革幣制應授權政府辦理，但必須在最短期內實行。簡貫三主張應成立法幣發行管理委會，由行政院長，財長，主計長，審計部長，央行總裁五人組織，發行之數字應向立法院報吿。黃元彬主應改革幣制，但如授權政府，實不放心，主張由立法院制定原則，交政府執行。最後決定原則上成立法幣發行管理委會，並原則上贊成改革幣制，但如何成立及如何改革，財金會八日晨再開會討論。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　中國航業的展望</h3>
<p>— 徐學禹</p>
<p>地球表面，十分之七是水，所以水上交通運輸發達最早，直到現在，還佔着極重要的地位。</p>
<p>中國內陸多的是長江大河，海岸綫又長達一萬一千餘浬，論理負賣水上交通運輸的航業應該很發達。然而自從海禁大開以來，中國的航業雖然也有了將近八十年的歷史，可是我們自已的航業，在戰前僅有五十萬噸的陳舊船舶，戰後的今日也祗有一百萬噸性能並不太好的船舶，比起別的航業國家來眞是渺小得很。離怪外國人士，尤其是英國朋友們，批評我們，說我們的航業（一）沒有良好的政策，（二）沒有良好的船舶，（三）沒有良好的管理，（四）沒有良好的技衛。</p>
<p>的確的，七八十年來，我們還沒有一個確定的航業政策。自從前淸同治年間開始創辦航業以來，除了李鴻章盛宣懷等少數人還能認識航業的重要性，儘量以國家的力量扶植航業而外，其餘的大都只曉得靠賈辦制度發財，根本不懂得什麼為國家民族利害着想的航業政策。直到國父在三民主義裏喊出廢除不平等條約的口號，大家才注意到航權問題，國父在實業計劃裏又提出一千四百四十餘萬噸商船的指標，大家才感到我國商船的缺乏，又直等到蔣總統領導抗戰接近勝利，不平等條約才正式廢除，航權也才實行收回。總統在中國之命運一書裏，又規定了最初十年內要完成三百萬噸商船的工作量，航業的重要性這才漸漸為國人所認識。但是積重難返，實際的政治對於航業的愛護與扶植到現在還沒有多少事實表現，而整個的航業政策也還沒有具體的確定。</p>
<p>我們的造船工業不發達，還不能造我們自已需要的船，這是我國航業最感困難的所在。戰後承美加諸國讓售不少船隻，但是這批船隻不是船齡在三十年以上的戰前舊船，就是戰時趕造的軍用運輸船隻，而且大部份是貨船，眞正的客船簡直沒有。我們也曾向各國接洽訂造新船，但是各國都忙着自已的戰後航業復員，沒有餘力來替我們造船。再則世界各國所有國際間航行的偉麗客船，無一不是由政府直接或間接給予造船補助和航行補助的，我國人士往往責備我們航業界沒有像樣的客船，尙請注意我們航業界始終並沒有享受到外國回業所享的種種優待這一點。</p>
<p>談到管理問題，我們覺得這完全是受了幾十年來買辦制度的遣壽，所以直到現在還不能够澈底根除。買辦制度是當初英國人的民族優越　所造成的，他們在本國並不採用買辦制度，可是到了殖民地或是次殖民地，認為白種人不宜乎和有色種人直接接觸，於是一切假于於買辦。中國初辦航業，一切做效英國人在中國的辦法，所以也就倣用了買辦制度。買辦是航業的寄生蟲，祗曉得藉航業圖利發財，當然不會愛護航業的。因此中國航業的管理，就受了　重的影響；直到現在，雖然買辦制度已經取消，而其遺毒却還沒有根絕。</p>
<p>我們的船員，在駕駛方面的技術決不後人，祗是輪機方面，因現在有許多新式機器是我國舊有船隻所沒有的，因此在使用上需要再加一番訓練。可是，這正是過去我國航業受外國航業壓迫，未能隨時發展的必然結果。自從抗戰勝利以來，我們的船隻增加，其中頗多裝置高速度柴油引擎者，我們的船員經過短期訓練之後，不久就能够單獨運用這種繁複的機器，而且從來沒有發生過什麽意外。可見我們的船員，祇要有機會學習，絕對不難在技衛方面求得進步。</p>
<p>現在要發展中國航業，我們必需接受外國人士的批評，針對着前面所說的三種缺點，由政府社會以及我們航業界本身，上下一心，努力去求改進。</p>
<p>我們希望政府趕快遵照國父的實業計劃和總統的中國之命運兩書裏關於航業的指元，擬訂明確而具體的航業政策，就像一九三七年美國的商船條例那樣，特別制定一種單行法規，把我們對於航業的終極目標，進行程序，造船補助，開航補助等等基本的國策，都一一訂明，以便執行的人有所遵循。其實採取航業保護政策的，並不僅美國一國，凡是航業國家，如英法荷蘭挪威以及戰前的日德義諸國，無不如此，否則僅憑航業風身，絕對無法成功的。我們最佩服英國政府對於保護航業的種種辦法，譬如去年香港政府會向我國訂購一批棉紗，若是用C．I．F．香港的辦法由中國船運到香港交貨，比用F．O．B．上海的辦法由英國船到上海來裝運，在運費上至少要便宜四分之三，然而香港政府，為了保護本國航業，寗可多出四分之三的運費，堅持採用F．O．B．的辦法，交英國船裝這。這就可以看出香港政府的目光遠大，決不貪圖近利。</p>
<p>最近續到斯倫克的報吿，其中關於日本航業，主張到一九五三年，日本應該擁有四百萬頗的全新商船，平均約合每廿二人有一噸。中國之命運內規定最初十年內中國要有三百萬噸商船，約合一百五十人才有一噸，實在並不算多。然而我們實際僅有一百萬噸舊船，距離三百萬噸新船的目標，還不知有多遠呢！</p>
<p>要想添置新船，最本的辦法，是發展己的造船工業。斯孺克的報告，對於日本造船工業的保全，就特別着重。他計，劃着日本所需要的四百萬噸新船，究全由日本自己分十三年造齊。中國要想大量增加新船，也非如此不可。若是向別的國家訂造，要看人家有沒有餘力，以及願不願意替我們造，若是向別的國家購買現成的船隻，一則合不合用頗成問題，二則眞正優良的船隻，人家又豈肯出售。記得在抗戰期中，英國本古公司有兩艘行駛川江的舊船（康定·萬流），那時英國已經放棄在中國的約河航行權，招商局曾經一再洽購，以應戰時川江運輸的急需，然而，太古公司寗可任其停航廢衆，却始終不肯出售，可見　買現成船隻之不易。</p>
<p>美國對於中國的航權，絕對不存絲毫野心，這是我們所深信不疑的。不過近來因為過去在中國行駛的外國航商們，總還想捲土重來，所以對於中國的航業，不借運用種種手段，以圖破壞中傷。美國朋友們，往往在無意之中，受了朦蔽，甚至於述我們的政府和社會也有一部份人受了朦蔽，因此我們不能不乘此機會，予以揭穿。我們懇切的希望在航業方面和我們根本沒有利害衝突而又眞心想帮助我們經濟復興的美國，能够像對日本航業的那　關心，繼續給我們以精神上和實質上的帮助。</p>
<p>航業對於國家的整個經濟，關係至鉅。英國就靠航業的外匪收入，維特着一部份國際收支的平衡。最近美援物資的運輸，英國力爭全部由英國船裝運，藉以减少美金的支出，美國也已經同意了。但是美國援華的物資却有一半規定由美國船裝運，其餘的四分之一還要交由別國船隻裝運，中國船至多僅能裝運全部的四分之一。美國方面又提出開放南京漢口的建議，其，由上海到南京漢口，若是用中國船轉運，則運費就無需用美金支付，若是由外國船直接運去，則這一段運費，還得由美援的外匯裏面開支。目前英國誠然急需美金外匯，但是美國旣然能够瞭解英國的需要，當然也能瞭解中國的需要比起英國來還要迫切。</p>
<p>關於發展航業以維持國際收支平衝的問題，我們政府似乎也還沒有明確的認識。例如去年我國有五十萬噸海南島的礦砂，售給日本，本來砂價每噸祗有美金六元五角，而運價每噸却有美金十元，兩者合計起來，我國政府共可收入美金八百二十五萬元。我們航業界為了帮助政府爭取外匯，自願收取法幣運費派船裝運，後來英國奧特公司向東京的盟軍總部接洽，砂價運價總共祗收每噸美金十六元二角五分，而對我國政府則願付砂價每噸美金七元，這樣一進一出，祗在運價方面每噸减少了美金七角五分，我們的政府為了貪圖每噸多收美金五角的砂價，就忘記了每噸美金十元的運價損失，結果這筆生意成全了英國的奧特公司。奧特公司所得的美金，又全部由英國政府所收購。這樣一來，我國政府雖然在砂價上多得了二十五能美金，但在運價上却讓給了英國政府五百萬美金！這固然是由於我國政府各部門之間缺少聯擊所致，但一是我們就此一端，就可以看出英國政府對於航業收入的重親，以及英國官民之間的密切聯繫。我們希望政府在這種種方面，多多效法英國！</p>
<p>在管理方面，我們航業界當然應該加緊努力，從事整頓與改革。不過有許多牽涉到整個政治及社會問題，絕對不是航業界所能單獨為力的，還希望政府和社會方面給我們以有力的支</p>
<p>於船員的技術問題，我們當然盡量就現有船員，加以新的訓練，以應目前需要；同時我們更盼望政府，急起直追，加强航業敎育，從速倣效航業先進國家，培植後起的航業人才，將最新的知識與技能傳授給他們，好讓他們擔負起今後發展航業的任務。</p>

<p>一，在美利堅合衆國政府或中華民國政府中之任何一方政府參加西德任何區城或脫里斯脫自由區之佔領或管制之期間內，他方政府對於各該區域之商品貿易，將適用一九四七年十月三十日所訂關稅曁貿易總協定所戴有關最惠國待遇之現有或於將來修正之各條文。</p>

<h3>南阿斷絕經濟關系　對阿爾巴尼亞冒凟行爲　南斯接替三度照會抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：業巳與南斯拉夫斷絕貿易關係之阿爾巴尼亞，今日下令南斯拉夫文化與貿易代表團在四十八小時內離開阿國。在另一方面，南斯拉夫外交部巳為阿方繼續貿易關係事，向阿國提出强硬抗議，認為阿方舉動巳破壞國際公法。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕貝爾格勒電台廣播：南斯拉夫官方通訊社「唐友格」三日訊，阿爾巴尼亞已與南斯拉夫斷絕經濟關係。阿國巳廢棄興南國所訂之日貨幣及關稅同盟條約，並要求駐阿協助該國建設之南人於四十八小時內撤退。此項行動係阿京蒂拉那於六月三十日及七月一日兩次致南照會中所發表。按二日晚，南國京城電訊稱，阿國已停止油類及他物之輸往南國，並停止兩國間之鐵路建築。自戰後阿爾巴尼亞在東歐共產國家之廣泛組織內，事實上已成為南斯拉夫之衛星國。此次行動似由共產情報局對南共聲明所促成。南共公報透露已警吿阿方此舉破壞兩國之友好互助條約，阿爾巴尼亞「必須負此一行動所引起後果之責任。」</p>
<p>〔衆社倫敦三日電〕據員爾格勒電台廣播：南斯拉夫昨日以三件威脅性之照會交與阿爾巴尼亞，抗議阿國支持共產情報局對蒂托元帥攻擊之「侮辱」及「鄙野」行動。此項照會措詞强硬，與最後通牒不相上下，於南共直接向史達林籲請撤銷共產情報局對蒂托及其僚屬之譴責之後數小時發出者。</p>
<p>南國致阿爾巴尼亞之三件照會，第一件照會要求懲討「侮辱」蒂托，將其照片撕下及採取「破壞南國聲望」行動之阿人。若此項「冒凟行為」再予繼續，則南斯拉夫對其結果不能負責。</p>
<p>第二件照會抗議阿政府之下令停止建築南阿共同興建通至阿南邊界之鐵路，禁止以阿南共同在阿開採之礦產及阿爾巴尼亞所產之油輸入南國。南政府除要求阿政府撤銷此項命令外，並要求阿國派代表來南，談判兩國間之歧見。第三件照會係抗議南派駐阿爾巴尼亞之施尼克（南陸軍政治部主任）已為阿國命令立即返國，該服會又稱，阿陸軍參謀長巴洛克少將毀謗南國及其領袖之態度「下流」。</p>
<h3>英美密切注視　蘇南關係發展　希望多瑙河會議能如期召集</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕西方官員現正注視史達林狄托反目一事，週來，狄托及其南共羽黨已以最强烈之言語抗拒克林姆宮。此外，狄托亦與保加利亞及阿爾巴尼亞兩近鄰口角不休，南國危機之第二步行動有待於蘇聯。克林姆對此昔為寵兒今成仇寇之狄托，究將如何處置？英美暫時至少均採「不干涉」態度，以待莫斯科「淸理」狄托及醫治新創後再說。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日在記者招待會中稱，關於南斯拉夫問題，國務院正密切注視其發展，但在目前尙朱便正式發表意見。馬氏否認國外所傳狄托曾「建議」渠可放棄南斯拉夫對特港之要求，而以獲取美經濟援助為交換條件，馬歇爾稱並無此項建議。馬氏在答覆問題時談稱，國務院並未接獲希境觀察家之報吿，表示南國支持希游擊隊抵抗政府軍之舉有任何改變。馬氏復稱，美國仍繼續進行其準備工作，以便參加七月卅一日在貝爾格勒舉行之多瑙河會議，並不因南國與蘇聯之糾紛而中止。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕因美國務卿馬歇爾之上項聲明英國已建議由英美蘇法駐貝爾格勒大使請狄托元帥發出請柬，舉行多瑙河會議。政界人士相信蘇聯對此舉之答覆，可以證明貝爾格勒與莫斯科之裂痕，是否亦影響外交政策。</p>
<h3>英南簽訂　貿易協定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二日電〕英國與南斯拉夫今日在倫敦簽定協定，南國將以値英金二百萬鎊之木料，以英船與南船運供英國，南政府曾提出擴大貿易協定之建議，英政府之覆文刻在南政府考慮中。</p>
<h3>南驅逐美記者</h3>
<p>因發表毀謗性之報導</p>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒三日電〕南斯拉夫情報部宣布，英國電訊社某美國記者發表毀謗性之報吿，指貝爾格勒大學之共黨團體宣布反對南共中委會所發表關於共產情報局宣言之決議，已經南政府撤銷其在南國居住之權。外國若干報紙若捷克之眞理報等，均曾轉載此一報吿，其實貝爾格勒大學職員之宣言，係拒絕承認共產情報局對南共之指責。</p>
<h3>應付柏林危機　三強保持接觸</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕杜魯門總統今日與馬歇爾國務卿及其他閣僚討論柏林危機，歷時一小時許，由馬卿詳細報吿三强在柏林危機中所採之步驟。</p>
<p>〔路透華盛頓二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日招待記者時，拒絕討論柏林危機，頗使在座之二百鑰位記者失望·但　透　，正在　參衆　院外委會主席協商現在起草中以對付蘇聯對鎖柏林的計織。馬　最近曾入醫院檢查體格，歷時十一日，渠謂將於週六再入醫院約一兩夭始出院。在院中時仍將與柏林局勢保持密切接觸。就馬卿之言觀，在週末以前，當不致有重大之發展。馬　　國務部與美國駐英大使每日有四五封電報來往。</p>

<h3>羅勃森函蘇軍總司令　要求解除柏林封鎖　爲獲答覆前三強不致採外交行動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：德境美軍總司令克萊，英軍總司令羅勃森及法軍官一人，今日與蘇軍司令索柯洛夫斯基會談二十分鐘，作為解除柏林危機之最後努力。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕西歌三日開始以輕鬆心境安渡週末，惟均覺下週可能為柏林事件而與蘇聯攤牌，同時並暗示南斯拉夫狄托元帥之命運。據悉，經一週不絕協商後，英美法已決定聯合行動路綫，第一步為英駐德軍事總督羅勃森之三日淸晨致函蘇柯洛夫斯基，主張重新會商柏林危機，如蘇氏拒絕所請，並不肯解除柏林之圍，則第二步為三國强碩向莫斯科抗議，雖其文字堅强明確，然無最後通牒性質。外部發言人暗示，在蘇柯洛夫斯基答覆或遲遲不答覆前，外交上不致有何新舉動發生。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕西方盟國今日正在等待蘇聯對英方建議與其討論柏林局勢的答覆。英軍總司令羅勃森今晨致書蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基，要求立即開放柏林與英軍區邊界海姆斯台特間之公路交通，定期恢復柏林與海姆斯台特間之鐵路交通，及保證不再阻撓通至柏林之內河船舶。羅勃森之函有云，「六月廿九日來函謹悉，知限制德人民之往來蘇聯區與西德，乃係保護貴區幣制狀態，以待貴區實施新幣制之暫時措施·茲聞閣下已准持有過境派司之德人往來西德與蘇聯區之間，甚覺欣慰。又悉貴方正盡力修理柏林與西德間之鐵路，俾於柏林西區糧况嚴重以前恢復貨運，惟盼閣下能以恢復之期示知。今欲吿知閣下者，乃為內河船舶之往來尙未暢通，盼能加以調查以資勿予干擾。以言柏林海姆斯台德間之公路交通，閣下曾以幣制問題為辭，想公路之開放決不致有損貴區幣制，希望該綫交通能立即恢復。余於上月廿六日曾建議討論在柏林使用四强管制下一種幣制之事，今此項建議仍繼續有效。惟首要之事，自屬恢復柏林與西德問之運輸，使柏林人民得度其正常生活。本人極願與悶下一談，以討論恢復交通之日期及方法。</p>
<h3>日衆院通過預算案　蘆田內閣初渡難關　民主自由黨將提不信任案</h3>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕馬歜爾國務卿在記者招待會上拒絕美國與土耳其簽訂同盟條約之建頗，蓋此約之訂將使美國之整個外交政策不得不變更。其對每一國之關係不得不予重新考慮。按此一建議，據云係土國外長所提，曾見諸昨日之紐約報紙。</p>

<h3>美最新收音機　可不用眞空管　大如火柴頭金屬球能擴大電力</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕此間倍爾電話公司新發明一種無綫電收音機，不用眞空管，其中心部份為少數金屬，大如火柴頭，效用與眞空管同。此機式樣似可再小，但是否能縮至手錶大小，現尙不得而知。此機開時並無燈光亦不發熱，所用電流較一個電筒所需者為少。惟此時尙在試騐期中，不能立即應市。製造此機之倍爾公司科學家已發見　子學誠之新原理，除無綫電機外，並可應用於其他方面。機中不用眞空管，而用大小如皮鞋帶尖頭之小金屬圓筒，底部為一火柴頭大小之金屬球，其神秘即在於此。若將電流出入之綫，依正確地位迎接於此球，即能擴大電力。其間隙不過一紙之微。電綫亦細如毫髮，金屬　簡中所有者祗此，惟電子之作用並不使其耗損。此小金屬球不僅如眞空管之能擴大電力，且能發出無綫電波，於眞空管功用之外，兼具有他種重要功用</p>

<h3>清理戰時租借債務　美蘇談判進行中　美要求歸還船隻卅一艘</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕馬歇爾今日在記者招待會中透露，蘇聯最近所提出關於兩國租借債務談判之照會，正由國務部研究中。美國要求蘇聯歸還戰時在租借案下借自美國之破冰船三艘及砲艇廿八艘。美國公司所享之專利發明，戰時有根據租借法供給蘇聯者，亦已由美國向蘇索取代價。關於蘇聯借自美國之商船，已交還美國者八艘，尙有八十七艘之處置尙在談判之中。槪括而言，美國要求蘇聯解決總額一百十億元之租借債務，其解決條件與其他參加租借案之主要國家與美所締之解決協定相同。在日本投降以前，為共同作戰努力而租借給蘇之戰爭用物資，美國並不提索收代價，但根據租借法案供給蘇聯之民用式物資，於日本投降時尙存在者，於和平以後顯然仍可加以利用，故美國認為應由蘇聯給予美國以合理的代價。</p>

<h3>水電煤氣調整價格　上漲率多者近兩倍　電話公司要求過高公用局未接受</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業七月份新價，昨經公用局邀集各公司代表嚴格審核，並呈奉市長核准，自今日（四日）抄表日起實行。尙有電話一項，因公司方面堅持之漲率太高，公用局方面不能接受，新價遂未能核定。水電煤氣新價如后：</p>
<p>水（每立方公尺）較上月增　零售給水站</p>
<p>英商與法商　九八，〇〇〇元　一七五％　三五，五〇〇元</p>
<p>閘北內地浦東　一二八，〇〇〇元　一七五％　四六，六〇〇元</p>
<p>煤氣（每一〇〇立方英尺）　較上月增二八五，〇〇〇元　一七一％</p>

<h3>霉季將盡　今晨豪雨</h3>

<h3>中國航海節的意義　恢閎海洋思想·加强航業建設　維護本國航權·增進海外關係</h3>
<p>昨日（七月三日）為我國第一屆航海節，全國輪船業聯合會理事長杜鏞及全體常務理監事發表「中國航海節的意義」一文，以恢閎海洋思想，加强航業建設，維護本國航權，增進海外關係四義相號召，語重心長，殊有價値，特為補載如次：</p>
<p>地球是人類文化和生活所慰藉的基礎，在它的總面積一億九千六百九十四萬方哩之中，海洋——廣義的海洋，包含江河湖沼等各種形態的水面，達一億三千八百七十七萬方哩，佔總面積百分之七十。有這樣浩瀚的水面，人類文化靠它交流，航業，漁業發展無疆。因為海洋是文化之母和國力之源，各國對於海洋事業，包括外洋，沿海和內河航業與漁業，無不特別重視，多方獎勵。美利堅等國，都定有航海節，在國民心理上建立海洋的觀念。我國渤，黃，東，南四海的海岸後總長一萬多浬，掌握着太平洋西岸通世界各處航綫的樞紐，在海洋事業上應有很重要的地位。從一九四二年二月十二日同英美兩國締訂新約以後，沿海和內河航行權收回了，中國建國的重點，顯然更要向海洋方面發展。抗戰勝利快三年了，全國航業界對於發展海洋事業的努力，已獲得初步的成功；全國人民，對於航業的重要性，也漸漸的認識。所以在上年船聯開成立大會的時候，各地代表一致決議建議政府以每年七月三日為中國航海節，得到政府的核准。今天是第一屆航海節，全國各地都在舉行紀念，熱烈慶祝。我們謹趁此機會，闡明航海節的意義：第一，</p>
<p>恢閎海洋思想：遠看埃及·菲尼基·希臘和羅馬時代文明的淵源，無不在於海洋。近看英·美·挪·法·荷等國的擴展，也全靠航業做先驅。十七八世紀，歷史上呌做商業革命時期，各國利用船舶，飄洋渦海來開疆闢土，進而建立海軍，揚威海外。戰前英國和它的殖民地，以二千三百萬噸的商船，掌握海上的霸權；第二次世界大戰，美國以猛進到六千萬噸的商船，執同盟國的牛耳。一部歷史吿訴我們，那個國家善於利用水面，它就當庶强盛。航業是立國之本，有航業才能確保航權，能制海才能確保領土。中國人對於海洋的認識，還不够深刻；中國的海洋，還剛剛開始利用。政治·經濟·敎育各方面，都沒有把發展海洋事業做中心，如同英·美等先進國家一樣。在很多人甚至於若干政府負責人腦海裏，沒有特別重視和獎助航海事業的觀念——他們常常把航業視為卅六行中的一行，把航權看做航業界的事。這種錯誤的觀念，使中國航海事業不能抬頭，民族和國家的富强不能形成。我們紀念航海節，首應恢閎海洋思想；殷切的希望：四億五千萬同胞的心理上，都有「海洋」兩個字。第二，</p>
<p>加强航業建設：國父在實業計劃裏，有建設全國商港和漁港的計劃以及建造商船一千萬頓的指標。這實在是建國上的基本需要，我們自當黽勉以赴。現在全國只有一百萬噸的商船，至少要在兩年以內達到三百萬噸，才能勉敷接替日本戰前在遠東航運上的地位。我們研究各國發展航業的過程：沒有一個不是靠國家的力量而建設成功的——造船器材多是免稅的；造船資金多是長期輕息甚至免息的國策貸款；航行的賠累無論是由於成本的較高或受外國船競爭的影響，多由國庫來貼補；美國在這方面的支出，非常龐大。我國政府對於航業建設，雖然也有意促進，可是還少實際上的措施，類似以上所述的。而具有建設性的航業政策，也有待於確立和推行，深望政府加以注意。全國航業界對於建設新中國航業所需組織·管理·技術·財力·物力各方面的要求，自當盡其最大的努力，來配合國策，便利交通。第三，</p>
<p>維護本國航權：航權是國家主權的重要部份，沿海和內河航行權的收同，是五十年來全國上下奮鬥的結果。回溯一八四二年中英南京條約以來一連串不平等條約，一直侵害着中國的航權，英國和日本的商船，在中國領水上活躍了悠久的歲月，喧賓奪主，使本國幼稚的航業不能成長。在國防，經濟，航業各種需要上，必須維獲本國航權。這種保護政策，英，法，日，意，荷，挪等國，固已行之甚久，而在美國尤其不惜工本。一九三七年美國商船條例，開宗明義就說：美國航業政策的目標，乃在於建設適當數量的商船隊，來供應美國國內和海外商務上的需要，此類商船，必須在美國建造，全部為美國人所有；船員都用美國人，並且縣掛美國旗。其中又規定：造船價格差額補助金和航行成本差額補助金。我國航業還在幼稚時代，怎麽能够不跟美國學呢？</p>
<p>還有一點要附帶說明的：最近美國援華法案對於我國經濟上有若干的拔援助，關於援助物資的運輸問題，即在海外航綫，也應儘量由受援國家的船舶來承運；而在國內航綫的轉運，更應由受援國家的船舶來担任。中國航業界對於一部份美援物資的內河轉運，早已決定列為優先運輸，予以特別優待，保證迅速便利。三年來曾有一向在中國享受航行特權的國家，希望中國政府允許外籍船舶，在中國沿海航行，並開放南京，漢口等內河港埠。這種要求，同中國收回不久的航權抵觸，乃遭遇强烈的反對，至今在中國人民的心理上，還有不愉快的印象。這次美國以很大的善意和隆厚的情誼來帮助中國，必能顧到中國人關於維護本國航權的信念，在援華措施之中，如果不能積極援助中國航業復興的話，至少在消極方面要避免不利的影響。第四，</p>
<p>增進海外關係：海洋大部份屬於公海的範圍。在公海上，各國商船可以自由航行。所以商船是國際的橋樑。一個國家為了發展海外貿易和文化關係，應當建立適當的商船隊。我國在南洋的華僑很多，商務關係很深，首應開拓南洋航綫，來同他們聯繫起來；此後同歐美各國的往來也日見密切。關於歐美航綫的開拓，也需要積極進行。</p>
<p>關於日本賠償和限制商船噸位問題，正為各方所矚目，要防止日本不再成為侵略的國家，必須限制它的商船噸位，不得超過一百萬噸。日本的海岸綫，較中國為短，商船是海軍的後盾，如果容許日本擁有較中國為多的商船。必然威脅中國和其他國家的安全。在紀念中國航海節日子，我們特別關心這個問題。</p>
<p>以上四點，是我們在中國第一屆航海節所應該提出來的要領。中國四億五千萬人對於錦繡河山，自有無限的珍愛，我們雖然遭遇許多的苦難，只有加强大家奮鬥的毅力。是的，航海的精神本來就是堅苦卓絕，精進不懈的精神。只要全國上下人人有航海的頭腦，人人知道利用海洋是立國强國之本，人人失志在各方面促進海洋事業的發展，那末中華民族的光輝，必然格外燦爛！</p>

<h3>請看福州苦難的人們　在雙重深坑中度夏天　白髮老翁演慘劇　抱孫投江自盡</h3>
<p>〔本報福州甘九日航訊〕夏，在都市裏少數人的心目中，是一個消閒作樂的季節，但是夏天帶給這廣大的閩都古邑的，却是苦悶和窒息——夏的威脅！入夏以來，「水」，「火」，接連的不幸的災厄，使大多數善良的人民由窮困變成了赤貧。</p>
<p>十天之間　大難到臨　首尾十天之間，全市面積五分之四，都成了澤國，三十三萬人口中，被災的總在二十五萬人以上，死亡及房屋倒塌，和財產損失，一時尙無正確的數字。本來政府該迅速的拿出辦理善後的辦法來，緊急的救濟一下。且看災後二三事：水災禍害了幾天，省府的「福建省水災善後委員會」的機構，應運而生，劉主席還曾聘請了省參議會丁議長和薩上將當主任委員，後來經過了地方人的擁戴，他自己才兼了主委的銜頭，但在這之前，被災的老百姓已不知死了多少，餓了多少，無家可歸者有若干人？流淚泣血者又有若干人？搶救和收容的工作，都由地方慈善社團來擔任，其中食米一項，則仰給於政府，但田糧處撥發的濕米，對救濟災胞究有什麼成效可言？善後會成立，劉主席率先捐助一億元，這是値得小百姓道謝的；然而反觀過去救濟湘災的情形，何以不拿出已往的精神，來發動一次閩災的救濟？</p>
<p>災後物價　漲勢駭人　災後的物價尤其漲得瘋狂，使大多數的人震駭得喘不過氣來，通貨膨脹的速度，也自然更因之而增加起來。省府統計處發表：福州市六月份各物價總指數為一〇五萬五七九〇倍，內食物類九十萬八八九一倍，（其中糧食一〇三萬一五一一倍，其他食品八七萬。八四八倍）衣着類一六二萬二〇五四倍，燃料類一一七萬九八五一倍，盡築材料九十萬七九八六倍，金屬電料類八二萬九九〇六倍，雜項類九六萬七六二〇倍。零售物價總指數為一一一萬〇〇八三倍，均較五月份平均上漲百分九十一强。端午節前，福州米價每石六百餘萬元，節後就漲到九百萬元，誰會想到災後的米價一直由九百萬突破千萬關，而二千萬元，而達二千八百萬元。這瘋狂的暴漲，小市民們為了這問題，莫不恐慌失色！當米價徘徊在千萬邊緣的時候，有一般人的看法是：閩北早稻即將登塲，米價臨迴光返照的時候，決沒有再漲的可能性，依往年的經騐也是以二三月為「難關」，因此，若干神經過敏的米商，不敢大量吸進，然而閩北早米究竟總還沒有登塲，福州市每天兩千石食米的供應，並不能因之减少，加以閩南各縣市，糧價暴漲，下江糧食就近漏海，上游的米，還沒有爬上福州碼頭，便被人搶購，轉運到海外去。上下游的來源斷絕了，消費的數量如故，從九百萬元，在兩天內便衝破了千萬大關。此次洪水泛濫，全省被災者近三十縣市，農村損失尤慘，早稻收成全部絕望，晚稻受損者約五成以上，因之日來米價的暴漲，便算獲得了很好的口實。</p>
<p>糧食平準　居然拉價　一切物價跟着上漲，祗要米店老板的一句話就是行情，要多少就得多少！照理說：米價已至此不可收拾的情勢，政府當局該拿出具體的辦法來，平抑漲風，然而事實並不如此，「糧食平準店」旣不來個大傾銷，反而在「拉價」，由央行借來糧貸，其已運用購糧者，始終沒有發放給平民，風傳已久的「配糧」，迄今還不曾兌現。</p>
<p>在生活的高壓下，饑餓者日見加增，跳江·上吊·賣妻·鬻子的情事日有所聞。這年頭悲觀的人們，走上自殺的途徑，自屬可憫，而其逃避現實，採取這種消極行為，照理說這未嘗不是一個缺乏理智的舉動，但是着到倉前橋一對白髮老翁抱了一個三歲孫子，因迫於生活，投江自殺，這情形就够令人沭目傷心了！</p>
<p>天災人禍，水火雙管齊下，這雙重深坑所造成的後果，是不可想像的，人們經過了這雙重的災禍，所僅餘的一切，可吃的都已吃光了，可賣的也賣盡了，面對着這生死存亡的嚴重關頭，可有人為他們想想辦法，讓他們渡過這無情的夏天？（史痕）</p>

<h3>塲外交易遭受打擊　華股全部漲停板　外股集會不便無法展開交易</h3>
<p>華股昨警備部全力對於塲外予以打擊，但以各路游資陸續湧集，小型股及雜股先放異彩，浸假面引起普遍之買風。一般空出塲外永紗者，鑒於環境緊張，亦來套買。塲外雖停止對敵，商決每天按存帳數只做十份之一了結交易。代辦費開原價，塲內則相反地愈做愈興奮。由即將增資之新華百貨起，至國貨止，十一時後，滿堂掛紅。永紗漲達五七五五元限度後，略有掙扎，繼續進行貼價買賣，新高峯達六〇二〇元以上，最後在五九〇〇元左右掙扎。警務當局巡迴各字號，對講電話不論有無核准設，一律斷綫，下週交易，勢必集中於塲內。永紗當視多空存帳之實力面定行止。小型股及雜股勢必更見吃香，傳薪大票五日登塲流通，人心易被激動。塲外各未上市股票，一致再昻一至二成强，以銀行文化紡織最秀。</p>
<p>公債昨又起蠢動，交易因警務當局之往來巡視，萬分不便，祗有百餘萬成交。統丙晨開五九萬，漲到六九萬而後稍平。較假期前計甲乙升六萬元，丙戊漲八萬元，統丁好起七萬元。</p>
<p>外股因集會地址點遭干涉，並有若干糾紛，無法展開正常之交易。</p>
<h3>人心挺俏買氣濃厚　棉紗布一致上漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以股票騰踊，人心挺俏，客路津粵等帮紛起採辦，業外拉提甚力。四十二支藍鳳紗，初開八億五千萬元，嗣因週六關係，貨主不願脫手，市呈堅昂。臨收本街略有補進，終以九億大關結束，比假前軋漲八千萬元，其餘各支粗細紗套利交易不弱，市呈先疲後堅，較六底大都軋升三四千萬不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初以公會通吿，嚴禁投機及代業外人買賣，塲內經警密佈，遲遲不敢開做。嗣以股市大都漲停，人心轉挺，龍頭細布仍在塲外喊開，銀根雖緊，晴中搜購有人，初開同業有售，天津帮亦有出籠，行情均開低。龍頭二千一百萬間有成交，旋有空戶抵補，頭寸寬裕者吸納，買風復盛，卒以二千四百萬結束，較假前漲三百五十萬元，龍頭B字亦好二百卅萬元，其餘四君子嗶嘰及漂布粗細斜紋色布士林布等，亦均軋升一二百萬元不一。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡代紗管會，昨日拋紗四九九件，總金額為三一八七二九〇〇萬，又售出布四六〇九〇疋，碎布一六八〇〇磅，被單三二〇條。</p>
<p>嚴密監視　紗布市場</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會王代主委，為配合治安當局緊急平抑物價施策，前日手論該會督察室，自昨日起，嚴格執行監察紗布市塲工作。該室漏夜準備，昨日淸晨，於軍警憲緊密聯繫下，由該室副主任常璉，偕同督察孟憲岐等，先後到紗布市塲布置監察網，紗有兩市場，經該項監察網縝密面嚴格發揮作用後，正當商人俱獲保障，投機商人立時歛跡。間有仍岡一逞者，終於在市塲前後門檢查派司時，原形畢露，當塲有十六人因不合規定，禁止入塲。有十人之入塲證被扣留交各該管公會保管，聽候處理。另有二人，帮同投機商人抬價操縱，查有實據，交由警備司令部駐塲人員帶部，待會商處分。該會此項措施，克使昨日紗布兩市塲情形，非常平穩，足證監察工作，頗見成效。該室此項措施辦法，係前夜趕訂，經呈由王代主委批准後施行者。</p>
<p>紡建計劃　以紗易花</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡建公司為有效收購棉花，渡過本年靑黃不接之時期起見，擬將紗布產品與農民交換原棉，交換率事先不作硬性規定，而於交易時臨時決定。此項計劃，正由該公司高級職員洽商中，日內可有定奪。目前收購原棉，地區日見狹隘，及資金週轉之困難，均有方法克服，但農民對法幣之價値，則普遍缺乏信心，收購時堅持以銀元付値，致造成技術上之困難。紡建公司之以紗易花計劃，即針對此點而提出，因以銀元交易，為法律上所不許可，故代之以物物交換。</p>
<h3>絲綢一致上漲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市仍吿上漲，比週三大二億元之譜。一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤十億九千萬元，旋因股市滿堂紅，行情頓吿激揚，升至十一億五千萬元。一度降至十一億元，午收卒又高至十二億元即期價，週一期價喊十二億八千萬元，下午塲外喊價降為十二億五千萬元。</p>

<p>綢貨　昨市激揚，眞絲被面上午收市五億四千八百萬元則期價，中午做週一期近六億元，下午再吿進展，最後六億二千萬元有成交。格子璧總機單上午二百萬元，下午喊價在二百二十萬元關內，惟未問做開。</p>
<h3>夏令呢羢减色</h3>
<p>呢羢標準行情，因昨前二日之封關，頭寸各家均聚，票據進出頗形繁盛，生意則未見熱鬧。兼之售價一路升漲已多，實銷在靑黃不接之時，本客諸買方咸漸减少進胃，致零躉價格仍與未封關前相彷彿。而夏令貨若派力司·凡立頂·羽紗呢·削克司頂·白灰淡色薄花呢等，昨則齊有下墜之象。茶會上趨勢俱見疲縮。</p>
<h3>結匯證明書　期限將展長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：結匯證明醫之有效期間，將自原定之七天，延長為一個月，輸管會日內將正式宣佈。出口業人士認為期限經延長後，結匯證明書不致如過去之被迫以低價出售，因此今後結匯證明書之售價可與市價接近，出口情形可更有起色。</p>
<h3>內滙率調整</h3>
<p>國家行局內匯，昨決定對福州等匯率調整如下：福州每千元二百八十元（原一百元），泉州二百五十元（原一百五十元），京滬綫各鎭十元（原六元），九江景德鎭一百二十元（原一百元），杭州四元（原二一元），重慶一百二十元（原三十元），成都一百二十元（原四十元），叙府一百六十元（原八十元），萬縣二百元（原一百二十元），四川區其他各地一百二十元（原八十元），貴州一百五十元（原一百二十元），雲南一百六十元（原一百二十元），陜西四十元（原三十元），其他各地未動。</p>

<h3>華北游資南來　銀根仍極鬆濫</h3>
<p>昨日銀根鬆弛，行局因華北游資南來，蓋出六九〇七億。其中以中央銀行差出最鉅，九〇七三億，中國銀行差出六一億，交通銀行差進一二八三億，農民銀行差進一六七二億，中信局差進一四五七億，郵匯局差出一七九三億，合作金庫差出三九二億。大交換行莊差進五五七六億，小交換差出五四三億，洋商差進六七八四億。</p>
<h3>限定價格·監視交易　米市仍在停頓中</h3>
<p>民調會拋米已告停止</p>
<p>米市昨假後開市，但由於當局仍限定價格，不得超過上週五，白粳限一千六百萬，並加派經濟警員及警備人員監視交易，貨主均以成本不够，無人售出，致市仍停頓未開。民調會之拋米，即日停止，塲外交易鮮有做開。在周家橋及徐家滙等郊區，零批價白粳二千零五十萬，薄稻二千一百萬，早稻一千九百萬元，麵粉·雜糧均因限價，故仍停市未開。麵粉限五百萬，雜糧限不得超過上週價格。</p>
<p>食油仍由當局硬性規定，以上週五為最高價，致貨主不開，相持至收市，由中植廠聯合各民營廠，共同以三千六百五十萬之價開售生菜油，初定三千担，後盡量開售，由中植與民營各半負責，請購者很多。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>

<h3>華茶外銷零落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者為明瞭最近華茶外銷情形，特趨訪某茶業鉅子。據吿邇來法屬北菲對於珍眉等緣茶，尙有銷路，但為數甚微，其他各地依然查無起色。揆厥原因，自國內生產成本興日同增後，與國外茶價更呈倒懸狀態。且加以戰敗國日本，在美國協助復興中，已在頻頻回甦，而尤以茶葉出口益見抬頭。聞不久又將繼續躉額輸出，其中除大半暢銷美國外，餘則擬向歐菲各地推銷。依現狀觀測，我國茶葉如仍任其摧殘，恐即瀕入絕境云。</p>

<h3>惠勃爾登奪標記　法根堡榮獲男子冠軍　五盤勝澳洲勃朗維區</h3>
<p>〔路一透社惠勃爾登二日電〕惠勃爾登男子單打，已由美國二十二歲加州靑年法根堡戰敗澳洲雙手大將勃朗維區奪得冠軍，比數：七—五，〇—六，六—二，三—六，七—五。戰局緊張，為惠勃爾登決賽中所罕見，在最末一盤，亦為決定性之一盤中，勃朗維區已以五比三佔優，且在第九局中勃氏已以三分佔先，祗須再獲一分，即可以六比三結束該盤而獲得最後勝利，不料法根堡有起死回生之術，連勝四局，反以七—五取勝，奪得最後勝利，全賽結果，為：七—五，〇—六，六—二，三—六，七—五，歷時二小時許。綜觀兩人表演，均未達決賽者之標準，至最後一盤，兩人以過分緊張，表演大見遜色，第一盤時，法根堡先以七—五獲勝後，第二盤勃朗維區一路領先，以八分鐘結束，勝一光盤。第三盤重由法根堡佔先，勃朗維區在該盤中，竟從未獲勝一次發球局。第四盤戰局漸緊張，一度成各三平手，勃朗維區運下三局，以六比三超出。法根堡年僅二十二歲，加里福尼亞州人，身長六呎一吋，勃朗維區年三十歲，身材矮小，亦為吃虧原因之一。</p>
<p>男子雙打，美國湯勃朋及莫洛埃以一—六，六—三，四—六，六—四，八—六勝瑞典貝格林及澳洲哈油而得決賽權，將與澳洲勃朗維區及賽格曼奪冠軍。混合雙打勃朗維區興美國白露小姐，以五—七，六—一，八—六勝捷古特洛勃尼及美國杜特夫人，澳洲賽格曼及美國赫德小姐以六—四，三—六，六—三勝美國湯勃朗及杜邦夫人，將決奪冠軍，勃朗維區及白露組固為上屆混合雙打冠軍。</p>
<p>女子雙打仍為美國小姐天下，白露小姐與杜邦夫人，以七—五，六—〇勝李巴尼夫人及史各斐小姐，另一組杜特夫人與赫德小姐以六—四，八—六勝英國波斯托克夫人及勃萊夫人，將由白杜組與杜赫組奪冠軍。</p>

<h3>島合之眾不堪一擊　紅襪大勝明星隊　今日下午二隊會師跑馬廳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕菲列賓棒球盟主紅襪隊，昨日下午在美童公學以壓倒之姿態痛擊明星隊，比數為七對一。賽前由美菲兩總領事行開球禮，並有本市名指揮康脫萊斯及亞萊納斯領導之六十人火樂隊蒞塲伴奏，賽畢由美僑聯合會主席花旗銀行經理湯姆士給獎，以大銀盃一座，贈予菲隊。</p>
<p>明星隊純係鳥合之眾，演來格格不入，而投手空軍之麥克萊與陸軍之漢尼山斯基，又俱大失常態，演出遠不逮中華之俞長鑾。全隊與中華相較，除進攻略勝一籌外，防守方面，反以缺少默契，相形見絀。第二局紅襪已有二人被黜，竟尙能乘明星內外塲之一再失誤，連得四分。第三局麥克萊又頻擲野球，再失兩點，遂陷淤大敗。第七局中，奧加華乘古盎加與雷德之一誤再誤，勉力為明星打破鴨蛋。各局戰績如下</p>
<p>明星　〇〇〇〇〇〇一〇〇一一</p>
<p>局（一）（二）（三）（四）（五）（六）（七）（八）（九）</p>
<p>紅襪〇四二一〇〇〇〇〇一七</p>
<p>紅襪與明星兩隊，定今午三時假跑馬廳二度會師，慶祝美國獨立紀念日，並請美海軍司令歐里許主持開球及給獎典禮。同時，傑維亞指揮之菲僑樂隊，亦將到塲伴奏助興，明星隊以首戰演出，離水準過遠，今日陣容，決予調整，以謀雪恥，投手一職，將由第一戰最博好評之俞長鑾出任</p>

<h3>西片不再來華</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>這幾天報上通日都有西片可能不再運華的消息，原因是西片商認為各電影院門票的價格定得太低，內之片商所「拆」着的一部份折合外匯後為數甚微，非但不能賺錢，而且簡直還要虧本。論常情，電影院對於門票的漲價，應當是和片商站在同一立塲的；然而這次却不然，電影院的門票雖然稍稍提高，但影院業却絕對不肯採用比照戰前票價按生活指數加成賣票的辦法，甚至不惜和西片業閶到破裂的局面。據說，至今雙方仍在僵持中。</p>
<p>影院業之不肯把門票的價格「漲足」，實在是極有眼光的聰明做法。法幣幣値下跌，電影院在這幾個月來早就在做「大廉價」的生意，影院業何嘗不懂？他們何嘗不想多賺些錢！不過，他們已面臨了兩個難關：</p>
<p>第一，是一般購買力已經降低了不少，多數人都在愁衣愁食，實在很少看電影的閒錢。多數人的生活已經不能「合理化」，影院的門票也就無法「合理化」。電影這個東西是祗能靠「多賣」的，你把門票定為五百萬元一千萬元，院子裏「小貓三隻四隻」，又有何用處！</p>
<p>第二，是好萊塢製片水準已經大不如前。美國的電影界已經公開承認，目前的水準實在遠不如英國影片。在全世界鬧着「金元恐慌」的今日，美國影片在歐洲各國的銷路早就一落千丈，英國一向因與美國有同文同種之雅，是美國電影最大的主顧，司是近來却為了節省美元起見，已經嚴格限制美國電影進口，而且還因此引起過美國外交當局的不滿。在這種空前的「逆境」下，美國電影界利潤旣微，更不敢輕率攝製「百萬金巨作」或「全體明星大會串」等等的「豪華片」了，凡仔細觀察戰後美國電影作風的人，一定可以看出「不敢用錢」的跡象來—攝製得頗為成功的「殺人者」就全是由二三流脚色演出的。本來，「不多用錢」並不就等於「不好」，然而，不幸得很，好萊塢的藝術却就是「錢」的藝術，像「殺人者」這種片子，實在是難得碰着的，祗好默是奇跡。</p>
<p>所以，影院門票之不能學最近兩個禮拜來米價那樣鷂子斷綫，扶搖日上，實在是力不從心，頗有苦衷的。但西片商方面難道就有堅特到底的決心嗎？恐怕也就未必。「殺鷄取蛋」的出典倒的確是外國來的，他們應該知這。</p>
<p>平心而論，好萊塢的片子雖然常以色情為號召，雖然常以庸俗的手法殺害了好的原作，然而也倒底自有其不可磨滅的成就，如「威爾遜總統傳」那樣的傳記片，狄土耐的卡通等等，都應當是不朽的。一旦眞的不來，未免有些可惜。但是，中國人不是有一句「塞翁失馬，安知非福」的說法嗎？</p>
<p>首先，我們很容易想起中國的電影界。西片果然不來，自然理應是國片稱雄之秋，何况國片也倒底頗有進步，如「假鳳虛凰」，如「艷陽天」，如「一江春水向東流」，無論在技巧上，在意識上，都已經有顯著的進步，前途大有希望，祗要努力下去，自然一定會有成績的。</p>
<p>不過，中國影片果然能把西片觀衆（我們祗談西片的中國觀衆）全部拉過來嗎？老老實實說，恐怕不會—至少在短時期內不會。在這一方面，能够塡補西片留下的眞空的，祗有話劇。</p>
<p>近七八年來中國話劇界的成就是空前的，即以在上海演出的話劇而論，從四洋劇作中翻譯或改編的，有巴蕾的一荒島英雄」（直譯就是「可敬的克萊敦」，記得在十年前的「小說月報」或「文學」曾連載譯文全文），有高爾基的「夜店一，還有莎士比亞的「麥克白」，「麥克白」改編的名字是不是呌「亂世英雄」呢？已經記不淸了。而國人創作的劇本尤可欣喜，如丁西林的「妙峯山」，陳白塵的「陞官圖」，曹萬的「蜕變」，費穆的「紅塵」（我以為「紅塵」比「浮生六記」好），吳祖光的「正氣歌」—眞是佳作迭見，大有欣欣向榮之象，不想，在好萊塢影片的洪流湧到時竟至黯然失色，吃了大虧。西片如果不來，話劇的復興是必然的。用一個譬喻來說，我們的話劇水準已經漸有出席「世界運動會」的資格了，乘此機會加油急進，不亦快哉！</p>

<p>午夜，美國最著名的修補各種繪畫的專家夏伯禮接到了這個電話。打電話的人是紐約一位著名收藏家的太太。夏伯禮曾見過這幅有名的雷白蘭脫的傑作，他也知道這張畫買進時價値三萬五千美元。</p>
<p>（一幀名畫的復活——圖中右起：（一）是一張平庸的人像；（二）用X光照射後，發現了人像的左肩上又有一肩，右下角多了一隻手的影子；（三）用藥水將原來的人像洗掉，原畫中女子的面目還依稀可辦；（四）「洗畫」竣事，原來這裏藏着一幀義大利名畫家茂利洛的眞蹟！這幀畫價値三萬五千美元。）</p>
<p>他趕到他那位顧客的家裏，但見那張畫中人像的口鼻之間已經綻了一條裂縫。那位年輕的太太含淚吿訴他，她的丈夫臨行時曾再三囑付不要搬動這些畫框，但她為了搬動傢俱，結果倒失手把那張最貴重的畫掉了下來，她的丈夫明天早晨就要從外埠回紐約，一定要大發雷霆了。</p>
<p>夏伯禮急急帶了畫同到自己的畫室，通脊工作，到天色將明時，這張畫已經送回原主，修補得好好的，掛在牆上，要用顯微鏡才看得出修補的痕跡了。</p>
<p>他先仔細審視了原來那張畫的帆布，然後另外揀選一張粗細完全相同的帆布，「織補」在那張畫的裂縫裏，然後摹倣了原作的筆觸和顏色，細心地描好。結果眞是「天衣無縫」，那位收藏家在六個月之後愉快地把那張畫以四萬元的價格賣掉，那位新得主也從未發見這張畫已經打過了「補釘」。最感激夏伯禮的自然是那位收藏家的太太，她送給他一隻鑲金剛鑽的金錶墜，以誌感謝之忱。</p>
<p>夏伯禮也常常「洗」畫。他往往在拿到一張平凡的畫之後，先用X光照一照，結果常常發現在這張畫的下一層還有一張畫，而且有時下面的一張倒還是一張名貴的傑作。於是他就用一種秘密配合的藥水輕輕搽在畫面上，結果在上面的一層油繪迅速「洗」掉，使下面的一張畫馬上重見天日。但用這種藥水時必須極端小心，否則連下面的一層油彩也會一同洗掉的。</p>
<p>最近還有一個貧困的義大利婦人，拿了一張不値錢的十七世紀的書到夏伯禮畫室去，她想把這張畫賤賣給夏伯禮，預備拿到了畫款供給她兒子的學費。夏伯禮一時興起，用X光把這張畫一照，結果發現下面果然還有一張畫，一「洗」之後，竟是文藝復興時代義大利名畫家安德里亞·但爾·沙托的作品！那位貧困的母親固是喜出望外，夏伯禮也高興得笑口常開。</p>
<p>明明是一張名畫，為甚麼倒要呌一個庸俗的畫手在上面再畫一張平凡的畫呢？夏伯禮說，也許是人們在私遝這些傑作到外國去的時候，想逃避關稅，所以加以「偽裝」。另外也還有別的理由，譬如說，英國在維多利亞女皇統治的時候，規定所有裸體的畫像必須補畫衣裳，以維風化，連裸體生翼的小天使也不准畫，以前畫的則不准保存。結果自然祗得重新畫一點東西上去了。</p>
<p>夏伯禮修理畫件的技巧尙不止此。有時，一張畫實在破舊得洗不勝洗，補不勝補了，他就拿來把它張在一只特製的畫架上，把有畫的一面向下。他先把向上的一面（畫背）濡濕，突然拿出一把極銳利的小刀來，把那張帆布（油畫是畫在帆布上的）一陣亂刮，輕輕地剝了下來！他說，畫油畫的人們總是先在帆布上加一重膠質的東西，然後再加上顏色的，他現在刮掉的是帆布！然而從來不弄壞那極薄的一層膠質，因之原畫就一點也沒有受傷。</p>
<p>於是，在那畫架上的一層極薄的膠膜上，他再塗上一種特製的强力膠水，在膠水還沒有乾的時候，他已經把另外預備好的一張新帆布黏了上去，再用特製的二十磅重的大熨斗仔細把縐紋熨平，最後是把那張畫緊緊的夾在一個兩面都極重的夾子裏。這樣一來，那張畫是已經「脫胎換骨」了。然後他再把這張畫的正面用藥水輕輕拂拭，多年積垢應手而除，一張畫的壽命又延長了幾十年。</p>

<h3>Promulgation of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement: Scope Limited to Economic Aid, Valid Until the End of June of the Year After Next</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] The Sino-American Bilateral Agreement regarding the use of American aid was signed at 3:00 PM on July 3 in the reception room on the second floor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At 3:15 PM, the Chinese representative, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, and the American representative, Ambassador Stuart, sat side-by-side at a long table. Amidst the flashes of magnesium lights, they simultaneously began to sign two original copies of the agreement. In the Chinese version, Ambassador Stuart, as usual, signed his Chinese surname. After exchanging and signing the two original copies, Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Stuart shook hands to express their congratulations and took group photos with all the Chinese and American officials present. Subsequently, they each delivered brief speeches. Foreign Minister Wang first expressed his deep satisfaction that the bilateral agreement could be signed as scheduled and praised the cooperative spirit of the staff of the American Embassy during the negotiations. He also stated: "The Chinese government and people are sincerely grateful for the assistance from the United States and are determined to work hard to promote self-reliance." Ambassador Stuart then read his written statement (see below). After he finished, Lapham also delivered a speech, saying: "Administrator Hoffman of the Economic Cooperation Administration of the United States is extremely concerned about the progress of aid to China. Now that the bilateral agreement has been signed in a timely manner, it is sincerely hoped that the two sides can cooperate closely in the future to maximize the effectiveness of American aid." The entire signing ceremony lasted only a little over ten minutes, and the ceremony and arrangements were extremely simple. It reminded people of the similar circumstances of the signing of the Sino-American Relief Agreement and the Sino-American Naval Agreement in the same reception room last year. When signing the relief agreement, Ambassador Stuart said, "This is only the beginning of assistance." The American aid stipulated in the bilateral agreement should be a continuation of that. This reception room will soon become a historical site recording Sino-American friendship. Those who attended the signing ceremony on July 3 included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shishun, Director of the Treaty Department Hu Qingyu, Deputy Director Wang Xiaoxi, Director of the American Affairs Department Dong Lin, Deputy Director Chen Shicai, Director of the Protocol Department Shen Changhuan, Director of the Intelligence Department Shi Zhaoying, Deputy Director Zhou Shukai, Minister of the American Embassy Clark, Commercial Counselor McKinley, Secretary Bowen Jie. Moir, Resident Representative of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration in China Lapham, and his special assistant, Bartman. (The full text of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement will be published on page two.)</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 3] The content of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement signed on the afternoon of July 3 is largely consistent with the bilateral agreements signed with the United States and European recipient countries. Its scope of application is limited to the economic assistance portion of the US$400 million in American aid, which amounts to US$275 million. The military assistance portion of US$125 million will be handled separately. This agreement is valid until the end of June 1950.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] The Sino-American Bilateral Agreement and its annexes and exchange of notes were formally announced on July 3, and Foreign Minister Wang also issued a statement clarifying the main points of this American aid. The full text of the agreement contains twelve articles, stipulating the matters related to the use of the economic assistance portion of the US$400 million and the obligations assumed by China as a result. The "Annex" lists the understanding of certain articles in the agreement. The "Exchange of Notes" concerns the provision that trade in goods from West Germany and the Free Territory of Trieste should enjoy most-favored-nation treatment as stipulated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the end of 1950. The agreement is valid until June 30, 1950, that is, it will continue to be effective for fifteen months after the twelve-month period for the use of American aid from April of this year to March of next year is completed.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Explanation of the Entire American Aid Issue by Minister Wang</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] On July 3, Foreign Minister Wang, representing China, signed the American Aid Agreement. In addition to publishing the full text of the agreement and its annexes, he also provided the following comprehensive explanation of the entire American aid issue:</p>
<p>(1) The total amount of funds decided by the U.S. Congress for aid to China this time is US$400 million.</p>
<p>(2) The purpose of the U.S. aid to China this time, as clearly stated in its congressional bill, is to assist the Chinese government in stabilizing the domestic economy and establishing domestic peace as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) The US$400 million in aid to China decided by the U.S. Congress is divided into two types: economic assistance and special assistance. Economic assistance is US$275 million, and special assistance is US$125 million.</p>
<p>(4) The Sino-American Bilateral Agreement and its annexes signed today only apply to the aforementioned economic assistance. The content of this bilateral agreement is largely consistent with the content of the bilateral agreements signed by the United States and European recipient countries. The main points of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) The agreement does not stipulate the repayment of this aid. According to mutual understanding, this economic aid is generally in the nature of a grant, except for a small portion used for special construction projects, for which repayment methods may be discussed separately in the future.</p>
<p>(B) This amount is scheduled to be used for twelve months (i.e., from April 3 of this year to April 3, 1949). As for the effective period of the articles of this agreement, it is set from the date of signing to June 30, 1950.</p>
<p>(C) The U.S. government reserves the right to suspend the disbursement of the aforementioned grant.</p>
<p>(D) China must take possible measures to utilize its own resources and national financial strength to develop industry and agriculture, improve the financial and monetary system, reduce trade barriers, and promote foreign commercial relations. China should provide the United States with convenient opportunities to purchase items that the United States lacks and that China can export, on a fair trade basis. The Chinese government has the responsibility to fully inform the Chinese people of all facts concerning American aid.</p>
<p>(E) How the national currency obtained from the sale of American aid materials should be handled must be agreed upon by representatives of both China and the United States. The ways of handling it are approximately: (1) Freezing (i.e., withdrawing legal tender to stabilize finance and prices), (2) Using it for certain types of industrial and mining railway construction and rural restoration work.</p>
<p>(5) The US$125 million for special assistance will be handled separately. The U.S. government has notified our ambassador to the United States of the procedures for allocating the aid, and this ministry has instructed our ambassador to the United States to reply in agreement on July 2. The funds can then be used. The period of use for this fund is twelve months. This fund is used for military needs, without any conditions attached, and its nature is a grant. The above is the content of the American Aid Agreement. As for the achievement of the two goals of American aid, "assisting China in stabilizing the economy and establishing domestic peace as soon as possible," it requires the sincere cooperation of the personnel responsible for implementation on both the Chinese and American sides, and it still depends on our efforts in self-reliance in the future.</p>
<h3>Remarks by the American Ambassador: Eager to Enhance Friendship</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 3] Ambassador Stuart of the United States made the following remarks after the signing of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement: "I am very pleased that the United States and China have signed a bilateral agreement today. I know that the American people will also be very pleased. According to the agreement, the United States agrees to assist China in the struggle to restore normal life, because years of war have disrupted this life. The American people fully understand the great sacrifices China has made in our common struggle against Japan. The American people also fully understand that there is no hope for a just and lasting peace in the world if any place is disturbed by unrest, or if any nation is unable to have the opportunity to seek a decent life so as to gain its dignified position in the world. The American people hope to assist the Chinese people in self-reliance, reaching a state of peace, prosperity, and human dignity. We are eager for this agreement to be another strong and lasting link in the bond of friendship and cooperation, which has always been an outstanding characteristic of Sino-American relations."</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Beiping Open Foreign Exchange, Yesterday's Transactions Very Few</h3>
<p>Three Senior Officials of the National Bank Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, July 3] Three senior officials of the National Bank are in Beiping to discuss with Fu Zuoyi the abolition of the suspension of exchange for circulating currency and the restriction on the withdrawal of remittances from the Northeast. Results may be achieved today, and the old methods may be restored next week, that is, remittances below 200 million can be freely withdrawn. In addition, preparations are being made to exchange cloth for coarse grains from Chahar and Suiyuan. The three officials will no longer go to the Northeast and will return to Shanghai in the next few days to report back.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Beiping, July 3] After the banks in the city of Beiping opened for foreign exchange applications on July 3, the total amount of foreign exchange applied for by the banks was no more than 30 billion, which was very small. According to authoritative analysis from the financial community, the reasons are: (1) Lack of cash, (2) Today is the weekend, and cash cannot be withdrawn on Sunday, (3) The Shanghai market has been severely controlled by the authorities, making speculation difficult.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tianjin, July 3] Tianjin officially opened for foreign exchange applications on July 3. The Tianjin branch of the Central Bank announced an exchange rate of 70 yuan, and the actual exchange rate was calculated at 80% of the listed price. July 3 was Saturday, and there were very few remittances.</p>
<h3>Interrogation on the Printing Costs of Legal Tender: Ministry of Finance Will Request the Central Bank to Reply Within Five Days</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] At a meeting of the Finance and Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan on July 3, legislator Jian Gongsan questioned Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, who was present: (1) Is it true that the printing cost of each legal tender note is rumored to be US$0.085, equivalent to 340,000 legal tender? (2) Is it true that someone solicited handling fees during the printing of legal tender? (4) What is the procedure for issuing legal tender? Who has the final decision-making power? Director Liang immediately replied: The printing cost of legal tender is definitely not as high as rumored, and the issuance must be submitted to the president for approval. Legislator Jian expressed dissatisfaction with Liang's reply. Finally, Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan stood up and said that the above three questions would be forwarded by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank for a response within five days.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] If the printing cost of legal tender printed in the United States is converted into legal tender at the black market rate, each note would reach 40,000 legal tender. According to Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, a certain version of legal tender printed in the United States costs US$9.45 per thousand notes, and the cheaper ones cost US$5.50 per thousand notes.</p>
<h3>President Weng Sends Letters to Two Ministers of Friendly Parties, Urging Them to Take Office in the Capital Immediately, and Also Inviting Two Political Commissioners to Assume Their Duties Early</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] President Weng of the Executive Yuan, noting that the Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce have not yet formally taken office, which has inevitably led to a standstill in ministerial affairs, specially sent letters to Ministers Zuo and Chen on July 2, urging them to take office. The original letter stated in brief: "Since the implementation of the Constitution, it has been more than a month since the Executive Yuan began operations. I admire the knowledge and am delighted to have the opportunity to work with you, two brothers, as you continue to serve as Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce. At this time when the country is facing difficulties, I especially hope that we can support each other and work together. I sincerely hope that you will take office and work together to promote progress, arriving at the ministry before the 5th of this month, and also hope that you will invite Zhenwen and Shuming to assume their duties early to facilitate official business."</p>
<h3>Chen Bulei's Letter to Li Huang</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] Mr. Chen Bulei was in Shanghai last week and sent a letter to Mr. Li Huang of the China Youth Party on the morning of July 1. On July 3, a reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Chen, who showed him a draft of the letter and said that he had made his best efforts for the cooperation of the three parties and now only hoped for understanding from the friendly party and had nothing else to say. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Elder Brother Youchun, I respectfully address you. Yesterday (the 30th) at 4:00 PM, I received a long-distance call from Nanjing, relayed by Brother Hong Lanyou, stating your public instructions, roughly that the new Executive Yuan has been established for a full month, and the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce urgently need someone to preside over them. The central government's expectations are pressing. Because I am more familiar with friends of your party, I am specially instructed to humbly present the situation, earnestly requesting that Brothers Shunsheng and Qitian must graciously go to Beijing to take office before July 5, and the two political commissioners of your party should also go to Beijing at the same time to comfort the hopes of those inside and outside the government. As for the issue of legislators, I will still do my best to find a solution, but progress on this matter is particularly difficult. I only hope for your understanding and that you will not treat the issue of legislators and participation in the Executive Yuan as one and the same. I have caught a cold and am unable to visit, but the promotion of cooperation among the three parties is something I sincerely pray for. Now that Chiang Kai-shek and the central government's expectations are so pressing, and the situation is difficult and the economy is turbulent, I humbly believe that today is the time for us to set aside our differences and dedicate ourselves to the country. I specially present the main points of the Beijing telegram in a letter, earnestly requesting that you urge the friends of your party's central committee in Shanghai to immediately persuade Brothers Zuo and Chen to go to Beijing to take office as scheduled so that the political affairs of the two ministries can be actively promoted and the key plans of the Executive Yuan can be collectively discussed, which would not only be fortunate for the overall situation but also be of great benefit to the entire cooperation issue. In the past month, I have followed the gentlemen of our party and originally thought of contributing to the cooperation issue, but my heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient, and I have not contributed much. I ask myself with shame, but I rely on knowing you well. I once again express my sincerity, and the power to turn things around depends entirely on your wisdom. I hope that you and the gentlemen of your party will truly benefit from it.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng and Chen Bulei Issue Written Statements</h3>
<p>Hoping that People of the Youth Party Will Participate in the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Chen Bulei, Acting Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, recently issued the following written statements:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of cooperation between our party and the China Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, we still hold the original intention of the past during the constitutional period. We have previously issued statements inviting them to participate in the cooperation. We are grateful that people from both friendly parties have responded with sincerity and sensitivity. First, they participated in the Control Yuan, and then they presented candidates to the President for the Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Committee members of the Examination Yuan for consideration and approval. All these facts show that the spirit of unity among our three parties for the country is not only consistent but also increasing, which is gratifying. However, the Executive Yuan is the center of administration, and the political commissioners of both friendly parties have not yet participated to this day. The Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce are particularly important at this time when production and construction urgently need to be developed and the social economy urgently needs to be stabilized. President Weng has already sent letters urging the two ministers to formally take office as soon as possible. We sincerely hope that people from both friendly parties will consider the difficulties of the current situation, fulfill their national salvation duties, and resolutely participate so that political affairs will not be affected. As for the legislators already elected by both friendly parties, we also hope that they will arrive at the Legislative Yuan early to express their opinions and discuss matters with the legislators of our party and non-partisan legislators to facilitate the progress of constitutional government. As for the issue of legislators, we will continue to work hard to seek a solution. The three parties united sincerely during the War of Resistance and the Constitutional era, which has a long history. Today is the time for us to carry out our original aspirations and serve the country. We sincerely hope that people from both parties will respond in unison to satisfy the general hope and the expectations of the central government.</p>

The first alternates for the two units are both members of the Youth Party and can be filled according to law. In addition, the Youth Party has about four or five people who were elected as first alternates in various districts and may be able to fill legislative seats in the shortest possible time due to legislators in those districts being reassigned to other positions.

<h3>Nominations of Grand Justices and Examination Committee Members: Presidential Memorandum Sent to the Control Yuan, Control Committee Holds Discussion Meeting to Discuss Exercising the Right of Consent</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] The President's memorandum on the list of 17 nominated Grand Justices and 19 Examination Committee members was delivered to the Ling Yuan on the afternoon of the 3rd. However, since the Yuan is in recess, it is inconvenient to convene a meeting to exercise the right of consent immediately. The President of the Yuan has decided to convene a discussion meeting with all Control Committee members at 4:00 AM to discuss and resolve the matter of exercising the right of consent. As for the candidates for Grand Justices and Examination Committee members, both the Control Yuan and the Presidential Palace are keeping it secret and have not disclosed it.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Finance and Banking Committee Decides: In Principle, Supports Currency System Reform; Meeting Set for the Morning of the 8th for Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Banking Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 3rd to review two proposals: one submitted by Gu Hegao and others regarding the establishment of a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee, and another submitted by Dang Jingyan and others urging the government to promptly implement currency system reform. Liu Jianqun chaired the meeting, with Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance, and Liang Ping, Director of the Central Bank's Issuance Bureau, also attending to provide explanations and answer inquiries. After discussion, the chairman summarized the committee members' opinions into the following three points: (1) All agreed on the necessity of establishing a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee, but the method of establishment remains to be discussed. (2) Opinions were divided on whether to immediately cease issuance, requiring further study. (3) In principle, no one opposed currency system reform, but whether the Legislative Yuan should first establish principles and authorize the government to handle it within a time limit also requires detailed study. It was decided to reconvene the Finance and Banking Committee at 9:00 a.m. on the 8th for further discussion.</p>
<p>Xu Baiyuan's Report</p>
<p>At the meeting on the morning of the 3rd, the original proposers first provided explanations, followed by Xu Baiyuan's report: (1) Regarding Legal Tender Issuance Management: Since the government implemented the legal tender in the 24th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1935), it established the Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Management Committee, with the headquarters in Shanghai and branches in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, responsible for checking the reserve figures and issuance figures. However, as the War of Resistance began, the work gradually came to a halt, and it was formally discontinued in the 28th year (1939). The remedy was to formulate other measures to consolidate finance. In October of the 28th year, the Four Banks Joint Council was established, with the Four Banks Joint Office concurrently responsible for checking issuance, until the time of victory. Regarding the issue of whether to publicize the legal tender issuance figures, the government had discussed it several times but made no concrete decision. While publicizing issuance figures would have a positive impact on economic stability, it was feared that it might stimulate prices. The reason for the necessary increase in legal tender issuance was due to reduced tax revenue and enormous expenditures. The current general budget is under review in the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan finds any inappropriate expenditures, it can reduce them accordingly. However, increasing revenue requires streamlining tax collection. The Ministry of Finance has already submitted four tax streamlining proposals to the Legislative Yuan for discussion, hoping they will be passed smoothly for implementation. As for the issue of currency system reform, it has been studied since the time of victory, but no concrete decision has been made. This is not due to excessive consideration by the government but because currency system reform should be done once and for all, not repeatedly. Secondly, currency system reform requires sufficient preparation. There are three possible reserves for reform: (1) foreign exchange, (2) commodities, and (3) hard currency, but none are currently adequately prepared, so it cannot be undertaken hastily. Xu specifically pointed out that the Soviet Union's recent currency system reform and the United States' past currency system reform were not discussed by parliament. The United States handled it directly by the president. If China wants to reform its currency system, it should also authorize the government to handle it to avoid affecting prices during discussions.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Legislators</p>
<p>After Xu's report, Liu Zhendong, Zhou Yongneng, Wang Mengyu, and others spoke one after another. Liu opposed publicly disclosing issuance figures and advocated for the establishment of a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee. Wang advocated for immediately ceasing issuance and authorizing the government to handle currency system reform, but it must be implemented within the shortest possible time. Jian Guansan advocated for the establishment of a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee, composed of the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Budget, the Minister of Audit, and the Governor of the Central Bank, and the issuance figures should be reported to the Legislative Yuan. Huang Yuanbin advocated for currency system reform, but he was not comfortable authorizing the government, suggesting that the Legislative Yuan should formulate principles and hand them over to the government for execution. In the end, it was decided in principle to establish a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee and, in principle, to support currency system reform. However, the method of establishment and reform will be discussed again at the Finance and Banking Committee meeting on the morning of the 8th.</p>
<h3>National General Budget</h3>
<p>Has Entered the Stage of Group Review</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The second plenary meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee was held in the auditorium on the morning of the 3rd, from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., in a closed-door session. Seventy-four committee members attended, chaired by Yin Shuxian. The meeting discussed and amended the review procedures for the national general budget for the 37th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1948) and amended and passed the review guidelines. The main points of the review guidelines are as follows: (1) Pay attention to budget balance. If there is a budget deficit, the principle should be to make up for it by streamlining tax revenue and saving expenses. (2) Pay attention to the streamlining of various important tax revenues. (3) Pay attention to increasing the surplus income of state-owned enterprises. (4) For superfluous agencies that have not gone through legislative procedures and have no budget for the first half of the year, their budgets should be eliminated. (5) For agencies that are too large and complex, their expenses should be reduced as much as possible. (6) Streamline state-owned enterprise agencies, reduce redundant personnel, and save expenses. As for the review procedures, they can be divided into stages: general review, group review, comprehensive review, joint review, and decision by the general meeting. It has now entered the group review stage, divided into seven groups. The budget committee members have each automatically identified a group to participate in the review.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee has scheduled the first joint meeting of all committees of the entire Legislative Yuan for the 5th to begin reviewing the general budget.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum: Prospects for China's Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>— Xu Xueyu</p>
<p>Seven-tenths of the Earth's surface is water, so water transportation developed the earliest, and it still occupies a very important position today.</p>
<p>China has many long rivers inland, and its coastline is over 11,000 nautical miles long. Logically, the shipping industry, which is responsible for water transportation, should be very developed. However, since the opening of the seas, although China's shipping industry has had nearly eighty years of history, our own shipping industry had only 500,000 tons of old ships before the war, and today it only has 1 million tons of ships with not very good performance. Compared to other shipping countries, it is truly insignificant. It is no wonder that foreigners, especially our British friends, criticize us, saying that our shipping industry (1) has no good policies, (2) has no good ships, (3) has no good management, and (4) has no good technical staff.</p>
<p>Indeed, for seventy or eighty years, we have not had a definite shipping policy. Since the beginning of shipping in the Tongzhi period of the former Qing Dynasty, apart from a few people like Li Hongzhang and Sheng Xuanhuai who could recognize the importance of shipping and tried their best to support shipping with the power of the state, most of the others only knew how to get rich by relying on the comprador system and did not understand what a shipping policy that considered the interests of the country and the nation was. It was not until the founding father Sun Yat-sen shouted the slogan of abolishing unequal treaties in the Three Principles of the People that everyone paid attention to the issue of shipping rights. The founding father proposed a target of more than 14.4 million tons of merchant ships in the Industrial Plan, and everyone felt the lack of merchant ships in our country. It was not until President Chiang Kai-shek led the War of Resistance to near victory that the unequal treaties were officially abolished and shipping rights were recovered. In his book "China's Destiny," President Chiang stipulated that the workload of 3 million tons of merchant ships should be completed in the first ten years, and the importance of shipping was gradually recognized by the Chinese people. However, due to long-standing problems, the actual politics of caring for and supporting shipping has not yet shown much practical results, and the entire shipping policy has not yet been specifically determined.</p>
<p>Our shipbuilding industry is not developed, and we cannot build the ships we need ourselves, which is the most difficult problem for China's shipping industry. After the war, we received many ships sold by the United States, Canada, and other countries, but these ships were either old pre-war ships over 30 years old or military transport ships built hastily during the war, and most of them were cargo ships. There were simply no real passenger ships. We have also contacted various countries to order new ships, but all countries are busy with their own post-war shipping recovery and have no spare capacity to build ships for us. Furthermore, all the magnificent passenger ships sailing internationally in all countries are directly or indirectly subsidized by the government for shipbuilding and navigation. Chinese people often blame our shipping industry for not having decent passenger ships, but please note that our shipping industry has never enjoyed the various preferential treatments enjoyed by foreign shipping industries.</p>
<p>Speaking of management issues, we feel that this is entirely due to the legacy of the comprador system for decades, so it has not been completely eradicated until now. The comprador system was created by the ethnic superiority of the British. They did not use the comprador system in their own country, but in colonies or semi-colonies, they believed that white people should not directly contact colored people, so everything was done through compradors. When China first started shipping, it imitated the British methods in China, so it also imitated the comprador system. Compradors are parasites of the shipping industry. They only know how to take advantage of the shipping industry to make money and will not care for the shipping industry. Therefore, the management of China's shipping industry has been severely affected. Until now, although the comprador system has been abolished, its poison has not been eradicated.</p>
<p>Our crew members are by no means inferior to others in terms of driving skills, but in terms of machinery, because there are now many new machines that our old ships do not have, they need to be further trained in their use. However, this is precisely the inevitable result of the past oppression of our shipping industry by foreign shipping industries, which prevented it from developing at any time. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our ships have increased, many of which are equipped with high-speed diesel engines. After a short period of training, our crew members will soon be able to operate these complex machines independently, and there have never been any accidents. It can be seen that as long as our crew members have the opportunity to learn, it is absolutely not difficult to seek progress in technical skills.</p>
<p>Now, to develop China's shipping industry, we must accept the criticisms of foreigners and, focusing on the three shortcomings mentioned above, work hard to seek improvement from the government, society, and our own shipping industry, united from top to bottom.</p>
<p>We hope that the government will quickly follow the guidance on shipping in the Founding Father's Industrial Plan and President Chiang's "China's Destiny," and formulate clear and specific shipping policies, just like the U.S. Merchant Marine Act of 1937, and specially formulate a single law, specifying our ultimate goals for shipping, the implementation procedures, shipbuilding subsidies, navigation subsidies, and other basic national policies, so that those who implement them have something to follow. In fact, it is not only the United States that adopts shipping protection policies. All shipping countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and pre-war Japan, Germany, and Italy, do so. Otherwise, relying solely on the shipping industry itself will never succeed. We admire the British government's various methods of protecting the shipping industry the most. For example, last year, the Hong Kong government ordered a batch of cotton yarn from our country. If the C.I.F. Hong Kong method was used to ship the goods to Hong Kong by Chinese ships, it would be at least three-quarters cheaper than using the F.O.B. Shanghai method and having British ships come to Shanghai to load the goods. However, in order to protect its own shipping industry, the Hong Kong government insisted on using the F.O.B. method and having British ships load the goods, even though it cost three-quarters more in freight. This shows that the Hong Kong government has a long-term vision and does not covet short-term benefits.</p>
<p>Recently, Schlenke's report continued, in which he advocated that by 1953, Japan should have 4 million tons of brand new merchant ships, averaging about one ton for every 22 people. "China's Destiny" stipulates that China should have 3 million tons of merchant ships in the first ten years, averaging about one ton for every 150 people, which is not much. However, we actually only have 1 million tons of old ships, and it is unknown how far we are from the goal of 3 million tons of new ships!</p>
<p>The most fundamental way to add new ships is to develop our own shipbuilding industry. Schlenke's report places special emphasis on the preservation of the Japanese shipbuilding industry. He plans to have Japan build all 4 million tons of new ships it needs itself in 13 years. If China wants to increase new ships in large quantities, it must do the same. If we order from other countries, we have to see if they have the spare capacity and whether they are willing to build for us. If we buy ready-made ships from other countries, it is questionable whether they are suitable, and other countries will not sell truly excellent ships. I remember that during the War of Resistance, the British Butterfield &amp; Swire Company had two old ships (Kangding and Wanliu) sailing on the Sichuan River. At that time, the United Kingdom had already abandoned its navigation rights on the rivers in China. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company repeatedly negotiated to purchase them to meet the urgent need for transportation on the Sichuan River during the war. However, Butterfield &amp; Swire Company would rather let them stop sailing and be wasted than sell them. This shows that it is not easy to buy ready-made ships.</p>
<p>The United States has absolutely no ambitions for China's shipping rights, which we firmly believe. However, recently, because foreign shipping companies that used to operate in China still want to make a comeback, they are using various means to undermine and slander China's shipping industry. American friends are often unknowingly deceived, and even some of our government and society are deceived. Therefore, we must take this opportunity to expose them. We sincerely hope that the United States, which has no fundamental conflict of interest with us in shipping and truly wants to help our economic recovery, can be as concerned as it is about the Japanese shipping industry and continue to give us spiritual and material assistance.</p>
<p>Shipping is of great importance to the country's entire economy. The United Kingdom relies on the foreign exchange income from shipping to maintain a balance of international payments. Recently, the United Kingdom has been fighting for all U.S. aid materials to be transported by British ships in order to reduce the expenditure of U.S. dollars, and the United States has agreed. However, half of the U.S. aid materials to China are stipulated to be transported by U.S. ships, and another quarter must be transported by ships from other countries. At most, Chinese ships can only transport a quarter of the total. The U.S. side has also proposed opening up Nanjing and Hankou. If Chinese ships are used to transport goods from Shanghai to Nanjing and Hankou, the freight will not need to be paid in U.S. dollars. If foreign ships transport the goods directly, this part of the freight will have to be paid from the U.S. aid foreign exchange. At present, the United Kingdom is indeed in urgent need of U.S. dollar foreign exchange, but since the United States can understand the needs of the United Kingdom, it can certainly understand that China's needs are even more urgent than those of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of developing shipping to maintain the balance of international payments, our government does not seem to have a clear understanding either. For example, last year, our country sold 500,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island to Japan. Originally, the price of the ore was only US$6.50 per ton, but the freight was US$10 per ton. Together, our government could receive a total of US$8.25 million. In order to help the government earn foreign exchange, our shipping industry volunteered to charge freight in legal tender and send ships to transport the ore. Later, the British Aut company contacted the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo and charged a total of US$16.25 per ton for the ore and freight, but they were willing to pay our government US$7 per ton for the ore. This way, the freight was reduced by US$0.75 per ton, but our government, in order to earn an extra US$0.50 per ton for the ore, forgot about the freight loss of US$10 per ton. As a result, this business was completed by the British Aut company. All the U.S. dollars earned by the Aut company were purchased by the British government. In this way, although our government earned US$25,000 more on the ore price, it gave up US$5 million in freight to the British government! This was certainly due to the lack of coordination between various departments of our government, but from this alone, we can see the importance that the British government attaches to shipping income and the close relationship between the British government and its people. We hope that the government will learn from the United Kingdom in many ways in this regard!</p>
<p>In terms of management, our shipping industry should certainly step up its efforts to reorganize and reform. However, there are many issues that involve the entire political and social problems, which the shipping industry absolutely cannot do alone. We also hope that the government and society will give us strong support.</p>
<p>Regarding the technical skills of crew members, we will certainly do our best to provide new training to the existing crew members to meet current needs. At the same time, we also hope that the government will catch up quickly, strengthen shipping education, and quickly imitate advanced shipping countries to cultivate up-and-coming shipping talents and impart the latest knowledge and skills to them so that they can take on the task of developing shipping in the future.</p>

<p>2.

<p>Exchange of Notes</p>
<p>(1) Note from the United States Ambassador to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China</p>
<p>Sir: With reference to the conclusion of the bilateral agreement for American aid to China, representatives of the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of China have recently conducted negotiations, as a result of which the following understanding has been reached, which I hereby confirm:</p>
<p>1. During the period in which either the Government of the United States of America or the Government of the Republic of China participates in the occupation or control of any area of West Germany or the Free Territory of Trieste, the other Government shall apply to trade in goods with those areas the existing or subsequently amended provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of October 30, 1947, relating to most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
<p>2. The undertaking of the Government of the United States of America or of the Government of China under paragraph 1 above shall apply to trade in goods with any area referred to in that paragraph only to the extent and during the period in which that area accords reciprocal most-favored-nation treatment to the United States of America or China, respectively.</p>
<p>3. The undertaking prescribed in paragraphs 1 and 2 above is premised upon the fact that no effective or important tariff barriers are at present erected on imports into the areas referred to in those paragraphs. In the event that such tariff barriers should be erected, it is understood that this undertaking shall not prejudice the application of the principles of the Havana Charter for an International Trade Organization relating to tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis.</p>
<p>4. The Parties recognize that, in the West German areas referred to in paragraph 1 above, the lack of a uniform rate of exchange for the currency may have the effect of indirectly subsidizing exports from those areas to an extent which is difficult to ascertain precisely. It is understood that during the existence of this situation, and provided that consultation with the United States of America has failed to produce a mutually agreeable solution of the problem, the taking by the Government of China of action to levy a countervailing duty on imports of such goods equivalent to the estimated amount of such subsidy shall not be regarded as inconsistent with the undertakings set forth in paragraph 1 above in the event that the Government of China determines that such subsidy is causing or threatening material injury to an established domestic industry or is materially retarding or threatening to materially retard the establishment of a domestic industry.</p>
<p>5. The undertakings in this Note shall continue in effect until January 1, 1951. In the event that, at least six months prior to January 1, 1951, neither Government has notified the other Government in writing of its intention that these undertakings shall terminate on that date, these undertakings shall continue in effect after that date until six months from the date of such notification.</p>
<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>To His Excellency Wang Shih-chieh, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China</p>
<p>J. Leighton Stuart (Signed)</p>
<p>Nanking, July 3, 1948</p>
<p>(2) Note from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China to the United States Ambassador to China</p>
<p>Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's Note of today's date, which reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Sir: With reference to the conclusion of the bilateral agreement for American aid to China, representatives of the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of China have recently conducted negotiations, as a result of which the following understanding has been reached, which I hereby confirm: (Original text same as the note from the American Ambassador to Foreign Minister Wang, omitted.)</p>
<p>etc., approved; this Minister hereby confirms the above understanding. I accordingly reply for your information.</p>
<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>

<h3>South Africa Severes Economic Ties, Protests Albania's Impudent Behavior, Names Nanus to Succeed in Sending Third Protest Note</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 3rd Broadcast: Albania, which has already severed trade relations with Yugoslavia, today ordered the Yugoslavian cultural and trade delegation to leave Albania within 48 hours. On the other hand, the Yugoslavian Foreign Ministry has lodged a strong protest with Albania regarding its continued trade relations, arguing that Albania's actions have violated international law.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 3rd] Belgrade Radio Broadcast: The Yugoslavian official news agency "Tanyug" reported on the 3rd that Albania has severed economic relations with Yugoslavia. Albania has abolished the currency and tariff alliance treaty signed with Yugoslavia and demanded that Yugoslavians assisting in the country's construction withdraw within 48 hours. This action was announced in two notes sent by Tirana, the Albanian capital, to Yugoslavia on June 30th and July 1st. According to a telegram from the Yugoslavian capital on the evening of the 2nd, Albania has stopped exporting oil and other goods to Yugoslavia and halted railway construction between the two countries. Since the end of the war, Albania has effectively become a satellite state of Yugoslavia within the broad organization of Eastern European communist countries. This action appears to have been prompted by the Cominform's statement against the Yugoslavian Communist Party. A Yugoslavian Communist Party communiqué revealed that it had warned Albania that this action would undermine the treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries, and that Albania "must bear responsibility for the consequences arising from this action."</p>
<p>[Reuter London, 3rd] According to a Belgrade radio broadcast, Yugoslavia yesterday sent three threatening notes to Albania, protesting Albania's support for the Cominform's "insulting" and "crude" attacks on Marshal Tito. The notes were strongly worded, almost like an ultimatum, and were issued hours after the Yugoslavian Communist Party directly appealed to Stalin to rescind the Cominform's condemnation of Tito and his associates.</p>
<p>The three Yugoslavian notes to Albania: the first note demanded punishment for Albanians who "insulted" Tito, tore down his photos, and took actions to "damage Yugoslavia's reputation." If such "impudent behavior" continues, Yugoslavia cannot be responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>The second note protested the Albanian government's order to stop the construction of the railway jointly built by Albania and Yugoslavia to the Albanian-Yugoslavian border, and the prohibition of importing minerals jointly mined by Albania and Yugoslavia in Albania, as well as oil produced in Albania, into Yugoslavia. In addition to demanding that the Albanian government rescind this order, the Yugoslavian government also requested that Albania send representatives to Yugoslavia to negotiate the differences between the two countries. The third note protested Albania's order for the immediate return of Shinnick (Director of the Political Department of the Yugoslavian Army) stationed in Albania. The note also stated that the attitude of the Albanian Army Chief of Staff, Major General Baroque, in defaming Yugoslavia and its leaders was "vulgar."</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Closely Monitor the Development of Soviet-Yugoslav Relations, Hoping that the Danube Conference Can Be Convened as Scheduled</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 3rd] Western officials are now watching the Stalin-Tito rift. Over the past week, Tito and his Yugoslavian Communist Party followers have resisted the Kremlin in the strongest possible terms. In addition, Tito is also engaged in incessant disputes with his two close neighbors, Bulgaria and Albania. The second step in the Yugoslavian crisis awaits the Soviet Union. How will the Kremlin deal with Tito, who was once a favorite but is now an enemy? Britain and the United States are at least temporarily adopting a "non-interference" attitude, waiting for Moscow to "clean up" Tito and heal the new wounds before speaking.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference today that the State Department is closely monitoring developments regarding the Yugoslavian issue, but it is not yet convenient to formally express an opinion. Marshall denied reports from abroad that Tito had "suggested" that he could abandon Yugoslavia's claims to the port of Trieste in exchange for American economic aid. Marshall said that there was no such suggestion. In answering questions, Marshall stated that the State Department had not received reports from Greek observers indicating any change in Yugoslavia's support for Greek guerrillas resisting government forces. Marshall reiterated that the United States is continuing its preparations to participate in the Danube Conference to be held in Belgrade on July 31st and will not suspend it due to the dispute between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 2nd] Following Secretary of State Marshall's statement, Britain has suggested that the British, American, Soviet, and French ambassadors in Belgrade invite Marshal Tito to issue invitations to hold the Danube Conference. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union's response to this move can prove whether the rift between Belgrade and Moscow also affects foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Britain and Yugoslavia Sign Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 2nd] Britain and Yugoslavia signed an agreement in London today, under which Yugoslavia will supply timber worth £2 million, transported by British and Yugoslavian ships, to Britain. The Yugoslavian government has proposed expanding the trade agreement, and the British government's reply is currently under consideration by the Yugoslavian government.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Expels American Reporter</h3>
<p>For Publishing Defamatory Reports</p>
<p>[Reuters Belgrade, 3rd] The Yugoslavian Ministry of Information announced that an American reporter from the British Telegraph Agency had published a defamatory report, alleging that a communist group at the University of Belgrade had announced a resolution opposing the Central Committee of the Yugoslavian Communist Party's statement on the Cominform declaration. The Yugoslavian government has revoked his right to reside in Yugoslavia. Several foreign newspapers, such as the Czech newspaper Truth, have reprinted this report. In fact, the declaration by the staff of the University of Belgrade was a rejection of the Cominform's accusations against the Yugoslavian Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Three Powers Maintain Contact to Deal with the Berlin Crisis</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 2nd] President Truman discussed the Berlin crisis with Secretary of State Marshall and other cabinet members for over an hour today, with Marshall reporting in detail on the steps taken by the three powers in the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall refused to discuss the Berlin crisis when he received reporters today, which disappointed the two hundred or so reporters present. However, Reuters learned that he is consulting with the chairmen of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees on drafting plans to counter the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. Marshall recently spent eleven days in the hospital for a physical examination. He said that he would return to the hospital for about one or two days on Saturday and then be discharged. While in the hospital, he will remain in close contact with the Berlin situation. Judging from Marshall's words, there will likely be no major developments before the weekend. The State Department and the U.S. Ambassador to Britain exchange four or five telegrams daily.</p>
<h3>Finnish General Election Results: Communist Party Falls to Third Place</h3>

<h3>Robertson Writes to Soviet Commander-in-Chief, Demanding Lifting of Berlin Blockade; The Three Powers Will Not Take Diplomatic Action Before Receiving a Reply</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 3rd Broadcast: General Clay, the commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, General Robertson, the commander of the British forces, and a French officer met with Soviet Commander Sokolovsky for twenty minutes today in a final effort to resolve the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 3rd] The West began to spend the weekend in a relaxed mood on the 3rd, but all felt that next week may be a showdown with the Soviet Union over the Berlin issue, and also hinted at the fate of Yugoslavian Marshal Tito. It is understood that after a week of continuous consultations, Britain, the United States, and France have decided on a joint course of action. The first step was a letter from Robertson, the British military governor in Germany, to Sokolovsky on the morning of the 3rd, proposing a new discussion of the Berlin crisis. If Sokolovsky refuses the request and refuses to lift the siege of Berlin, the second step would be a strong protest from the three countries to Moscow, although its wording is firm and clear, it is not an ultimatum. External spokespersons hinted that no new diplomatic moves would occur before Sokolovsky's reply or prolonged lack of a reply.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 3rd] Western allies today are awaiting the Soviet Union's response to Britain's suggestion to discuss the Berlin situation with them. General Robertson, the commander of the British forces, wrote to Soviet Commander Sokolovsky this morning, requesting the immediate opening of road traffic between Berlin and Helmstedt, in the British zone, the regular resumption of railway traffic between Berlin and Helmstedt, and a guarantee that there would be no further obstruction of inland vessels traveling to Berlin. Robertson's letter stated, "I have received your letter of June 29th. I understand that the restrictions on the movement of German people between the Soviet zone and West Germany are temporary measures to protect the currency situation in your zone pending the implementation of a new currency system in your zone. I am pleased to hear that you have approved the movement of Germans holding transit passes between West Germany and the Soviet zone. I also understand that you are doing your best to repair the railway between Berlin and West Germany in order to restore freight transport before the food situation in West Berlin becomes critical. However, I hope you can inform me of the date of restoration. I would like to inform you that the movement of inland vessels is still not smooth, and I hope you can investigate and not interfere. Regarding road traffic between Berlin and Helmstedt, you have cited currency issues as a reason. I believe that opening the road will not harm the currency system in your zone, and I hope that traffic on that line can be restored immediately. I suggested on the 26th of last month that we discuss the use of a four-power controlled currency system in Berlin. This suggestion remains valid. However, the most important thing is to restore transport between Berlin and West Germany, so that the people of Berlin can live their normal lives. I am very willing to discuss with you the date and method of restoring traffic."</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Passes Budget Bill; Ashida Cabinet Initially Overcomes Difficulties; Democratic Liberal Party Will Propose a Vote of No Confidence</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 3rd] After an all-night session, the House of Representatives passed the 1948-1949 budget bill by a vote of 217 to 176, totaling 414,462,000,000 yuan. The bill has now been sent to the Senate for discussion. The biggest point of contention in the budget bill is the government's request to increase national railway fares by 350 percent. A compromise was reached to increase them by 250 percent.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 3rd] The Japanese Senate passed the budget bill at 4:30 a.m. on the 3rd, and the cabinet crisis has passed. The Democratic Liberal Party led the opposition to this budget and stated that they would propose a vote of no confidence in the government at the last session of the Diet on the 5th. Members who opposed the budget stated that the budget bill requires a large increase in tax rates and forces commodity prices to rise, which will inevitably cause suffering to the masses. General observers believe that the consequences of the budget bill will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in prices, and labor will also demand higher wages.</p>
<h3>Three Powers Establish Their Own Military Government in West Berlin; Airlift of Food Continues</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 2nd] Less than 24 hours after the Soviet Union announced the end of the four-power joint control of Berlin, Britain, the United States, and France established a three-power military government in West Berlin. Berlin Deputy Mayor Ms. Schroeder denied that she had received an order from the Soviet authorities instructing the Berlin municipal government to refuse to accept orders from the Western allies regarding Berlin's municipal affairs. Earlier, the Berlin City Council had announced that the Soviet authorities had issued this order.</p>
<p>[All United Press 3rd] Commander of the Airborne Task Force, Major General Smith, stated on the 3rd: "The U.S. and British Air Forces 'will have enough to feed the residents of Berlin.'"

<h3>Bernadotte to Announce Palestinian Peace Plan Today; Arab League Has Submitted Reply to Bernadotte</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 3rd] As the four-week truce in the Holy Land is about to expire in six days, United Nations diplomats are awaiting United Nations mediator Count Bernadotte to formally announce the contents of his proposals for long-term peace in Palestine, which aim to secure peace between the Arab and Israeli sides.</p>
<p>The Count has made arrangements to have his peace proposals released simultaneously by the mediation departments in Rhodes, Cairo, Tel Aviv, and Lake Success. The time is 18 hours Greenwich Mean Time (Shanghai Daylight Saving Time Monday morning at 2 a.m.). It is feared that Bernadotte may also simultaneously announce the replies of the Arab and Jewish sides to his proposals. The possibility of both sides accepting the proposal is almost zero. It is reported that the Councillor is already anticipating this and has drafted a strategy to extend the truce period.</p>

<h3>Marshall Disapproves of U.S.-Turkey Treaty; U.S. Fleet Visits Turkey</h3>

<h3>U.S.'s Latest Radio Can Be Used Without Vacuum Tubes; Metal Balls as Big as Match Heads Can Amplify Power</h3>
<p>[Associated Press New York, 2nd] Bell Telephone Company here has newly invented a type of radio that does not use vacuum tubes. Its central part is a small amount of metal, as big as a match head, and has the same effect as a vacuum tube. The design of this machine seems to be able to be further reduced in size, but whether it can be shrunk to the size of a watch is not yet known. This machine does not have lights or heat when turned on, and uses less current than a flashlight requires. However, it is still in the testing phase and cannot be launched immediately. The scientists at Bell Company, who manufactured this machine, have discovered a new principle of particle science, which can be applied to other aspects besides wireless motors. The machine does not use vacuum tubes, but small metal cylinders the size of shoelace tips, with a metal ball the size of a match head at the bottom. The mystery lies in this. If the current input and output lines are connected to this ball in the correct position, they can amplify the power. The gap is only the thickness of a piece of paper. The wires are also as thin as hair, and all that is inside the metal tube is this, but the action of the electrons does not cause it to wear out. This small metal ball not only expands power like a vacuum tube, but also emits radio waves, and has other important functions in addition to the function of a vacuum tube.</p>

<h3>Clearing Wartime Lend-Lease Debts: U.S.-Soviet Negotiations in Progress; U.S. Demands Return of 31 Ships</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 2nd] Marshall revealed at a press conference today that the Soviet Union's recent note regarding negotiations on lend-lease debts between the two countries is being studied by the State Department. The United States is demanding that the Soviet Union return three icebreakers and twenty-eight gunboats borrowed from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act during the war. The patented inventions enjoyed by American companies that were supplied to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act during the war have also been requested for compensation by the United States from the Soviet Union. Regarding the American merchant ships borrowed by the Soviet Union, eight have been returned to the United States, and the disposal of the remaining eighty-seven is still under negotiation. In general, the United States is asking the Soviet Union to settle a total of $11 billion in lend-lease debts, the terms of which are the same as the settlement agreements concluded by the United States with other major countries participating in the Lend-Lease program. The United States does not demand payment for war materials lent to the Soviet Union for joint combat efforts before Japan surrendered, but for civilian materials supplied to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act, which still existed when Japan surrendered and can obviously still be used after the war, the United States believes that the Soviet Union should give the United States reasonable compensation.</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Water, Electricity, and Gas Prices; Increase Rate Close to Double for Most; Phone Company's Demand is Too High, Not Accepted by Public Utilities Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The new prices for public utilities in this city for July were strictly reviewed by the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, inviting representatives from various companies, and submitted to the Mayor for approval. They will be implemented from today (the 4th) onwards, based on meter readings. For the telephone category, the new prices could not be approved because the company insisted on a too high increase rate, which the Public Utilities Bureau could not accept. The new prices for water, electricity, and gas are as follows:</p>
<p>Water (per cubic meter) Compared to last month: Retail Water Stations</p>
<p>British and French Companies: 98,000 yuan, increase of 175% 35,500 yuan</p>
<p>Zhabei, Inland, Pudong: 128,000 yuan, increase of 175% 46,600 yuan</p>
<p>Gas (per 100 cubic feet) Compared to last month: increase of 285,000 yuan, increase of 171%</p>
<p>According to Director Zhao, the increase rate of various factors related to public utilities is: diesel is 250 percent, coal is about 190 percent, foreign exchange is 413 percent, the cost of living index is 111 percent, and the hardware index is 124 percent. Based on the above figures, various public utilities should increase by about 200 to 300 percent. The prices approved by the city government this time are lower than other factors, so it will definitely not lead to price increases. For electricity rates, in order to encourage energy conservation, the increase rate below 30 degrees is particularly low. In addition, for the 130 retail water stations throughout the city, because they are related to the drinking water of the common people, they will still be supplied at the June water price. In addition, the 80 summer tap water supply stations, in addition to the French company's area being open all day for free, the rest of the companies originally opened for two hours a day, and have been ordered to open for six hours, to benefit the drinking water of the common people.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Fuel Oil Approved for Early Exchange Settlement; Director Zhao Proposes Seven Demands, National Bank President Accepts Three</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Senators Jiang Hao, Ma Junshuo, Li Wenjie, Shao Yongsheng, and others, for the issue of foreign exchange settlement for public utilities, visited President Yu of the Central Bank yesterday at 11:00 AM to discuss the matter. Zhao Zengjue, representing the city's eight major public utilities companies, put forward seven demands: (1) Foreign exchange needed for one month's fuel oil should be settled in advance in one lump sum. (2) Import tariffs on fuel and surcharges from oil companies should be cleared in one payment at the time of oil withdrawal. (3) The difference between the exchange settlement certificate and the listed price should be temporarily advanced by the Central Bank and repaid by the companies in installments. (4) The price of coal allocated to public utilities should be maintained for at least one month without adjustment. The 15,953 tons of coal already sold by the Central Bank to various public utilities companies should be calculated based on the wharf delivery price when shipped from Qinhuangdao in June, plus the new freight and miscellaneous fees of the Fuel Management Committee in July, in order to alleviate the increase in coal prices. (5) The advance oil payments and other working capital required by each company should be borrowed from the Central Bank. (6) The raw material alum needed by the waterworks should be approved for foreign exchange settlement for import. (7) The monthly adjustment date of the selling price of public utilities should be advanced as much as possible. President Yu answered each of the above points one by one, accepting the first, third, and fourth items. The second item, the issue of oil tariffs, was notified to Deputy Tax Commissioner Ding Guitang for handling. The fifth item, borrowing, was not approved. The sixth item, alum import, is under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Management Committee. The seventh item, advancing the adjustment of selling prices, should be handled by the municipal government at its own discretion.</p>
<h3>Hotel Room Rates Approved for a 90% Increase</h3>
<p>The price of hotel rooms in this city, which was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 19th of last month, has only been two weeks to date. Due to high prices, the labor and management of the industry have decided to adjust it again, increasing it by 160% of the original price, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to approve it. The Social Affairs Bureau convened emergency meetings with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Hotel Industry Association, the Inn Industry Association, and the Hotel Workers' Union. As a result, it was decided to approve an increase of 90%, which will be implemented starting tomorrow.</p>

It is now known that the Senate, based on the resolution of the General Assembly, telegraphed the Central Government to request Wu's continued service. Yesterday, it received a reply cable from President Weng of the Executive Yuan. The original cable is as follows: "To Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing of the Municipal Senate: Your telegram of this afternoon is noted. Mayor Wu Guozhen of Shanghai has telegraphed to request his resignation, and this Yuan has already sent a telegram to retain him. Reading your telegram, it is clear that the Senate unanimously persuades him to stay, and public opinion is clear. A special telegram is sent to you for your information."</p>
<h3>Wage Payment Method Agreed Upon with Two Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee convened a small group meeting yesterday to study the wage payment method after the publication of the employees' cost of living index twice a month. Two measures were decided: (1) For those using the current month's index, the original method will still be followed, i.e., the first half of the month will be calculated based on the index on the 15th of the current month, and the second half of the month will be calculated based on the index at the end of the current month. (2) For those using the previous month's index, the first half of the month will be calculated based on the index at the end of the previous month, and the second half of the month will be calculated based on the index on the 15th of the current month. However, if there is an agreement between labor and management in the past, that agreement will still be followed. The above measures will be implemented after being studied by the small group meeting and passed by the General Assembly of the Committee next week.</p>

<p>Central News Agency Report: The China Construction Bank Corporation held a shareholders' meeting on the 26th of last month in the company's Construction Building. The most important motion was to discuss the proposal by Chairman Kong Xiangxi of the company to donate to the Kuomintang Mutual Aid Fund. After Chairman Li Shizeng delivered a speech, he read out Chairman Kong's detailed report, which stated: "On today's agenda, there is a proposal to discuss and resolve the donation of this company to the Kuomintang Mutual Aid Fund. This matter was initiated by Standing Director Song Ziwen. Mr. Song, in view of the large number of Kuomintang members who have died in the War of Resistance and the Suppression of Bandits, and whose families are lacking care and living in hardship, which is pitiful, initiated the raising of a Mutual Aid Fund for Party members and is willing to donate all of his personal shares in this company invested in Yangtze Electric, Huainan Mining Railway, and Hanzhen Jiji Water and Electricity Company. Mr. Song subsequently telegraphed me to ask whether the company's entire share could be unanimously donated. I replied that this move was deeply pleasing to me, and I personally expressed my great approval, and I would also donate all of my personal shares. As for other shareholders, please consult with them nearby and handle it according to law." Li stated: "Donating wealth to provide relief is a righteous act. Everyone present is a social pioneer who is eager to help the public. I trust that you will sympathize with this and hope that all shareholders will provide instructions." After the report was completed, discussions began. Shareholder Qian Xinzhi was the first to stand up and advocate that everyone should unanimously donate all the shares of the three companies, so as not to let Mr. Song and Mr. Kong have all the credit. The remaining shareholders also spoke one after another, all willing to sacrifice their personal rights. As a result, the principle of full donation was passed, and the company sent letters to solicit written opinions from the absent shareholders, which were collected within two days and handed over to the board of directors for a decision on implementation.</p>
<h3>Tongfeng Firm Swallows Resident Rice; Nearby Residents Appeal for Impartial Investigation and Punishment</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Amidst the soaring rice prices, the Tongfeng Firm Rice Store at 77 Ouyang Road in this city has actually engaged in the malfeasance of refusing to sell household rice. Yesterday, residents in the nearby area specially submitted a request to the Municipal Senate, appealing to the Senate to uphold justice and hoping that the relevant authorities of the city would conduct an impartial investigation and severely punish the firm so as to serve as a warning to illegal merchants. The malfeasance listed in the petition included the following: The Tongfeng Firm Rice Store recently received a large batch of American relief rice, which should have been distributed to residents in the area in accordance with regulations. However, when residents went to buy household rice, the store refused to sell it, claiming that it was sold out. The residents believed that the store was intentionally swallowing the household rice, so they secretly paid attention and discovered that the store was secretly transporting the American rice to other places. They immediately reported the matter to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, which sent officers to detain the household rice in question. However, the owner of the store was skilled at manipulation, running to the door of someone powerful to find a way to transfer the American rice back in the hope of concealing the evidence. At the same time, he also planned to falsely accuse the nearby residents, etc. It is said that the authorities concerned are conducting a strict investigation into the case. The Municipal Senate also forwarded the case to the People's Food Allocation Committee yesterday, requesting clarification and handling.</p>

<h3>The Fire Case on Henan Road Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Investigation The Report Lists Four Conclusions Relevant Agencies Cannot Evade Negligence</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of the dangerous goods explosion in the Zhongfa warehouse on Henan Road on the 5th of last month, which caused a major fire, many deaths and injuries, and property losses of 221.4 billion yuan, has been thoroughly investigated by the Municipal Police Bureau. The complete case files and reports were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation a few days ago. It is understood that the Fire Department's report lists four conclusions: (1) The main cause of the explosion and fire was waste film of nitrocellulose, which was privately transported and stored without the permission of the police bureau. The Zhongfa warehouse and the Dongcheng Company should be responsible for this. The Huangpu Police Sub-bureau, which failed to investigate and inspect the private transportation of dangerous goods, cannot evade the blame for negligence. (2) The management of the warehouse is under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Bureau. The Zhongfa warehouse has joined the trade association and has applied to the Finance Bureau for a license twice. The Finance Bureau transferred the case to the Public Utilities Bureau for verification and handling, so the Public Utilities Bureau should also be responsible. (3) The police bureau's notification of improvement was aimed at preventing the spread of fire when matches and sulfur burned. Even if the warehouse complied with the improvement, it could not prevent the explosion of privately stored waste film. However, the supervising department failed to review the notified improvement items. Jiang Zhishang, chief of the First Section of the Fire Department of the Police Bureau, should be disciplined to warn against negligence. (4) In this tragedy, Zhou Zhaoxiang, director of the Fire Department, requested severe punishment for himself due to inadequate prevention.</p>
<p>Regarding Zhou Zhaoxiang, Jiang Zhishang, and others, they have previously received administrative penalties. Who in the police bureau should bear criminal responsibility? Who in the Zhongfa warehouse should bear criminal responsibility? Zhongfa has not yet obtained a formal license to store dangerous goods. Who should be responsible? The report did not mention these few most important points, which are the most important points in this case. The case is being handled by Prosecutor Ding Chuanen of the District Procuratorate. It is reported that the hearing will be opened soon for investigation.</p>
<h3>Authorities Strictly Monitor the Market Surprise Spot Checks on Check Clearing Military and Police Launch Large-Scale Operations Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Jiang Jingguo Visits Xuan Tiewu to Discuss Stabilizing Commodity Prices</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, after the "six bottoms" period passed customs, the relevant authorities strictly implemented economic inspection work to prevent price fluctuations. In addition to military and police personnel strictly monitoring the market to prevent speculation, the Gold Control Bureau also dispatched thirty groups of inspectors yesterday morning to conduct surprise inspections of various banks and firms, paying attention to their check clearing. However, one item, prices, has not yet fallen back. Rice merchants have been in a bitter struggle because the price limit is lower than the cost, and no transactions have been seen inside or outside the market. The rise in cotton cloth yarn is still strong, and the prices of daily necessities are also firm. The rise in financial commodities is even more intense, and Chinese stocks have risen to the limit across the board. The main reason for the stability of prices yesterday should be attributed to the strict market monitoring by the authorities. Brokers in major markets are not allowed to trade with non-industry people. The daily trading volume and targets must be reported daily for verification. Violators will be severely punished. At the same time, in order to cooperate with the authorities' policy, the Central Bank ordered its agencies yesterday morning to sell off large amounts of materials and tighten credit. Judging from the current situation, prices may not rise sharply in the next few days.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Garrison Headquarters, after the Tong Dynasty decided on five emergency measures to suppress and stabilize prices, they tested their edge on the 3rd and continued to make arrangements for "cracking down on speculation and capturing profiteers." He revealed that the military and police personnel executing the five emergency measures will launch large-scale operations on the 5th to eliminate man-made price increases.</p>
<p>Many People Detained and Punished According to the Police Bureau, the result of yesterday's full-day market monitoring was that Fu Zhicheng was found to be using an expired market license at the North Rice Market. Zhang Runfu and Yang Xiqing, two foreign stock brokers, were detained at the Dechang Securities firm in the Overseas Chinese Building. Xu Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaogen, two suspects of off-site trading, and Tao Ranren, Pan Siming, Fan Zhenhua, Jiang Weifu, and Hu Shuwei, fourteen intermediaries who did not carry transaction orders, were arrested in the cotton yarn market. All were taken to the bureau for interrogation and punished separately according to the severity of the circumstances in accordance with the Violation of Police Regulations Act.</p>
<p>After Jiang Jingguo was ordered to come to Shanghai on the 2nd, he discussed the issue of stabilizing prices in the Shanghai market with Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, on the 3rd. Jiang also conveyed President Liu's instructions on stabilizing prices in the Shanghai market. It is reported that the President is extremely concerned about the recent price fluctuations in the Shanghai market and is deeply angered by the arrogance of speculators. The central government is carefully drafting concrete plans to stabilize the entire economy, which will be announced and implemented soon. Prior to this, the President specially instructed the military and police personnel in Shanghai to jointly investigate those engaged in speculative profiteering, hoarding, raising market prices, and buying and selling gold notes on the black market with relevant agencies and to investigate the methods they used and whether they had backing. Once these elements are found to be based on evidence, they will be given the most severe punishment.</p>
<p>Two Female Passengers Carry Eight Hundred Million Yuan Order to Deposit in the Central Bank</p>
<p>Police and military personnel in this city established three sea, land, and air inspection teams yesterday to inspect passengers arriving in Shanghai. Anyone carrying more than 200 million yuan in cash was ordered to deposit it in the Central Bank. Each team was led by a lieutenant colonel officer sent by the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters and was equipped with a squad of military police and police, jointly performing their duties with relevant agencies. On the 3rd, two female passengers who arrived in Shanghai by boat from Tianjin were found to be carrying more than 800 million yuan in cash and were ordered to deposit it in the Central Bank. The work of inspecting warehouses is currently under secret surveillance. To prevent the escape of materials from the warehouse, the garrison brigade of the garrison headquarters has sent personnel to strengthen inspections at various entrances and exits. After the registration deadline on the 6th, a universal inspection will be carried out, and tens of thousands of people will be dispatched at that time, including students.</p>
<p>Removing Intercom Telephones The Economic Section and Electrical Inspection Section of the Garrison Headquarters, together with the Military Police Regiment, the Economic Police of the Police Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and other agencies, dispatched more than 50 people, divided into ten groups, to inspect intercom telephones in the Securities Building yesterday, removing a total of 47 intercom telephones, including 12 from Jiayu, 3 from Housheng, 2 from broker Wu Jingwen at No. 60, 3 from Chengda, 2 from Zhendachang, 4 from Tongfu, 7 from Wanxiang, 3 from Taichang, 5 from Zhonghe, 3 from Southeast Trust Company, 1 from Dachang, and 11 from a certain company. More than 500 yards of cable were also removed.</p>
<p>Economic investigators of the Garrison Headquarters, based on a tip-off, found that a company on Kangxi Road was suspected of operating a gold note black market and arrested two suspects, who are being interrogated in detail.</p>

According to the meteorological joint report, a typhoon was discovered near 137 degrees east longitude and 15 degrees north latitude yesterday. However, due to the distance and its northwestward trajectory, the Chinese coast is unlikely to be affected. Last night, the low-pressure area in the Pacific Ocean moved westward, encountering a warm air current at 2:30 this morning, resulting in heavy rain. In addition, the rainfall during this year's Meiyu season is less than last year, so the average temperature is higher than last year. After "Leaving the Meiyu Season" on the 5th of this month (the old calendar's Minor Heat), the temperature may soar to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, so the truly scorching summer season is approaching soon. The forecast issued by the Central Meteorological Observatory is recorded below:</p>
<p>Yellow Sea: Sunny to cloudy and hot with haze, moderate variable winds, light waves, and morning fog along the coast.</p>
<p>Central China: Cloudy and hot, locally turning cloudy, moderate variable winds to calm.</p>
<p>Shanghai: Cloudy, still sunny, hot, with haze, moderate southwest to southeast winds.</p>
<p>East China Sea: Cloudy, hot, moderate southwest to southeast winds, coastal fog, moderate waves.</p>
<p>Three-day temperature: Minimum 27.2 degrees Celsius (81.0 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 34.6 degrees Celsius (94.6 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<h3>Fraudulently Cashing Checks: Friend Accuses Fleeing Criminal</h3>
<p>Ren Xiaming (aka Ren Hongqiao), residing at No. 1, Jihe Lane, Wengjia Lane, Nanshi, has no legitimate occupation. He usually carries a handgun and specializes in extorting relatives and friends. The number of victims is unknown. Last month, he privately carved a seal and used Ren Chongdao's name to have his son, Zu Yu, fraudulently obtain 8 million yuan from Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Guangxi Road. Guo Jinsheng, the restaurant's accountant, discussed the matter with Ren Chongdao and reported it to the police station. Ren Zuyu was detained and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and a factual indictment. Unexpectedly, Ren Xiaming recently used a blank check from a defunct sub-branch of the Yu Ye Bank, forged his friend Liu Yuanmin's seal, filled in 650 million yuan, and colluded with Zhou Weiyan as the holder to extort Liu Yuanmin. Liu filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, which sent Prosecutor Quan to summon Zhou to court for investigation. Zhou confessed to the fraud, stating that he was instigated by a woman named Li Weijun (aka Li Ying) and Ren Xiaming, and that he was merely being used by them, requesting leniency, etc. The bailiff was dispatched to No. 379, Changde Road, to arrest Li, but Ren had already escaped upon hearing the news. Yesterday, a second hearing was held, and Li was detained, and Ren Xiaming was being pursued for prosecution. It is said that Li Weijun and Ren Xiaming have a special relationship. Last month, it was reported that Ren Hongqiao (aka Xiaming), a member of the 16th branch of the Municipal District Party Department, claimed to be a Buddhist and wrote to the Municipal Government, intending to move the stone figures of the Wengzhong from Nanjing West Road to his home in Jihe Lane for worship. Interested parties visited his home and found only a small room, indicating ulterior motives.</p>
<h3>Robber on Beijing Road Resists Arrest, Injures Person</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 11:40 PM last night, three robbers suddenly entered Shenchang Cigarette Paper Store at No. 58, Xiamen Road. One held a box cannon, and three gold rings were robbed before they fled. The store owner, Xu Xirui, shouted for help from upstairs. Many people were out enjoying the cool air, and several followed in pursuit. Two robbers fled north with the stolen goods, while one headed south. At the entrance of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company on Beijing Road, Ye Zuofu, a police officer from the Old Zha District, arrived after hearing the alarm, and together with Liu Miaofa and Yu Jinlong, who were enjoying the cool air, bravely apprehended the robber. The robber then took out a box cannon and fired, a bullet hitting Yu Qiyun (18 years old, residing at No. 864, Hongxing Lane, Nicheng Bridge, Beijing Road) in the back of the left foot. The robber was then taken to the Old Zha Police Station, where Chief Jiang interrogated him. He gave his name as Chen Jichao, 24 years old, from Haimen. He was immediately detained pending transfer to the court. The wounded person was immediately sent to Hongren Hospital.</p>
<h3>Coca-Cola Restricted: Watson's Submits Explanation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] During the sixth general meeting of the Municipal Senate, Senator Zhang Ji and others proposed that Coca-Cola raw materials should be classified as luxury goods and restricted from import. The proposal was approved by the general meeting, and the review opinions of the Social Affairs Committee were sent to the municipal government for reference. Watson's Soda Company, the local Coca-Cola manufacturer in this city, specially submitted a document to the Municipal Senate yesterday to explain the matter, with the following key points: (1) Coca-Cola is sold in all countries except the Soviet-controlled area and is generally recognized as a common daily beverage. (2) The raw materials used by domestic soda factories all come from abroad. (3) Coca-Cola pays a very large amount of commodity tax every month, reaching 14 billion yuan in June of this year, plus the banquet donation and business tax of associated distributors, estimated at about 25 billion yuan. (4) The raw materials imported for Coca-Cola only account for 8% of the retail price. (5) Watson's Company is an organization operated by Chinese. (6) All machinery and equipment in the factory are invested by Chinese. Restricting the import of raw materials will seriously harm Chinese investment.

<h3>The Significance of China's Maritime Day: Promoting Grand Oceanic Ideas, Strengthening the Construction of the Shipping Industry, Safeguarding National Shipping Rights, and Enhancing Overseas Relations</h3>
<p>Yesterday (July 3rd) was China's first Maritime Day. Du Yong, Chairman of the National Shipowners Association, and all executive directors and supervisors published an article on "The Significance of China's Maritime Day," calling for the promotion of grand oceanic ideas, the strengthening of the construction of the shipping industry, the safeguarding of national shipping rights, and the enhancement of overseas relations. The words are earnest and valuable, and we specially reprint them as follows:</p>
<p>The Earth is the foundation of human culture and life. Of its total area of 196,940,000 square miles, the ocean—the ocean in the broad sense, including various forms of water surfaces such as rivers, lakes, and marshes—reaches 138,770,000 square miles, accounting for 70% of the total area. With such a vast water surface, human culture relies on it for exchange, and the shipping industry and fishery develop without limit. Because the ocean is the mother of culture and the source of national power, all countries attach special importance to marine affairs, including ocean, coastal, and inland river shipping and fishery, and give them various forms of encouragement. Countries such as the United States have designated Maritime Day to establish the concept of the ocean in the minds of the people. China's Bohai, Yellow, East, and South Seas have a total coastline of more than 10,000 nautical miles, controlling the hub of the Pacific West Coast's shipping routes to all parts of the world, and should have a very important position in marine affairs. Since the conclusion of the new treaty with Britain and the United States on February 12, 1942, the rights of coastal and inland river navigation have been recovered, and the focus of China's nation-building has obviously shifted more towards the ocean. It has been almost three years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and the national shipping industry's efforts to develop marine affairs have achieved initial success; the people of the whole country have also gradually recognized the importance of the shipping industry. Therefore, at the inaugural meeting of the National Shipowners Association last year, representatives from all over the country unanimously decided to suggest that the government designate July 3rd of each year as China's Maritime Day, which was approved by the government. Today is the first Maritime Day, and celebrations are being held all over the country. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the significance of Maritime Day: First,</p>
<p>Promoting Grand Oceanic Ideas: Looking back at the origins of civilization in Egypt, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, all were rooted in the ocean. Looking at the expansion of Britain, the United States, Norway, France, the Netherlands, and other countries, all relied on the shipping industry as a pioneer. In the 17th and 18th centuries, historically known as the Commercial Revolution, countries used ships to sail across the oceans to open up territories, and then established navies to show their power overseas. Before the war, Britain and its colonies, with 23 million tons of merchant ships, controlled the hegemony of the sea; during World War II, the United States, with a surge to 60 million tons of merchant ships, held the leading position in the Allied countries. History tells us that the country that is good at using the water surface will become strong. The shipping industry is the foundation of the country; with the shipping industry, shipping rights can be ensured; with sea control, territory can be ensured. The Chinese people's understanding of the ocean is not yet deep enough; China's ocean has just begun to be utilized. In politics, economics, and education, the development of marine affairs has not been made the center, as in advanced countries such as Britain and the United States. In the minds of many people, even some government officials, there is no concept of special emphasis and support for the shipping industry—they often regard the shipping industry as one of the thirty-six trades and regard shipping rights as the affairs of the shipping industry. This wrong concept has prevented China's shipping industry from rising, and the prosperity of the nation and the country cannot be formed. We commemorate Maritime Day, first of all, to promote grand oceanic ideas; we earnestly hope that the words "ocean" will be in the minds of 450 million compatriots. Second,</p>
<p>Strengthening the Construction of the Shipping Industry: In the Industrial Plan of the founding father of the nation, there are plans to build commercial and fishing ports throughout the country and a target of building 10 million tons of merchant ships. This is indeed a basic need for nation-building, and we should strive to achieve it. Now, the country only has one million tons of merchant ships, and it must reach at least three million tons within two years to be able to barely replace Japan's pre-war position in shipping in the Far East. We study the process of various countries developing their shipping industry: none of them has not been successfully built by the power of the state—shipbuilding materials are mostly tax-free; shipbuilding funds are mostly long-term, low-interest, or even interest-free national policy loans; the losses in navigation, whether due to higher costs or the impact of foreign ship competition, are mostly subsidized by the national treasury; the United States' spending in this area is very large. Although our government also intends to promote the construction of the shipping industry, there are still few practical measures similar to those mentioned above. A constructive shipping policy also needs to be established and implemented, and we hope that the government will pay attention to it. The national shipping industry will make its greatest efforts to meet the needs of the new China's shipping industry in terms of organization, management, technology, finance, and materials, in order to cooperate with national policies and facilitate transportation. Third,</p>
<p>Safeguarding National Shipping Rights: Shipping rights are an important part of national sovereignty. The recovery of coastal and inland river navigation rights is the result of fifty years of struggle by the whole country. Looking back at a series of unequal treaties since the Treaty of Nanjing between China and Britain in 1842, China's shipping rights have been constantly infringed. British and Japanese merchant ships have been active in China's territorial waters for a long time, overshadowing the host and preventing the growth of the country's fledgling shipping industry. In terms of national defense, economy, and shipping needs, it is necessary to safeguard national shipping rights. This protectionist policy has long been practiced by countries such as Britain, France, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway, and the United States is especially sparing no expense in this regard. The 1937 US Merchant Marine Act clearly stated that the goal of US shipping policy is to build an appropriate number of merchant ship fleets to meet the needs of US domestic and overseas commerce. These ships must be built in the United States, wholly owned by Americans, crewed by Americans, and fly the American flag. It also stipulates shipbuilding price difference subsidies and navigation cost difference subsidies. Our country's shipping industry is still in its infancy, so how can we not learn from the United States?</p>
<p>One more point needs to be added: Recently, the US aid to China Act provides some assistance to our country's economy. Regarding the transportation of aid materials, even on overseas routes, the ships of the recipient country should be used as much as possible; and the transshipment on domestic routes should be undertaken by the ships of the recipient country. The Chinese shipping industry has long decided to prioritize the inland river transshipment of some US aid materials, giving them special preferential treatment and ensuring rapid convenience. Three years ago, a country that had been enjoying navigation privileges in China hoped that the Chinese government would allow foreign ships to navigate in China's coastal waters and open up inland river ports such as Nanjing and Hankou. This request conflicts with China's newly recovered shipping rights and has encountered strong opposition. To this day, it still has an unpleasant impression in the minds of the Chinese people. This time, the United States is helping China with great goodwill and deep friendship, and it will definitely take into account the Chinese people's belief in safeguarding their national shipping rights. If it cannot actively assist the revival of the Chinese shipping industry in the aid measures, at least it should avoid adverse effects in the passive aspect. Fourth,</p>
<p>Enhancing Overseas Relations: Most of the ocean belongs to the high seas. On the high seas, merchant ships of all countries can navigate freely. Therefore, merchant ships are international bridges. A country should establish an appropriate merchant ship fleet in order to develop overseas trade and cultural relations. There are many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and the business relationship is very deep. We should first open up Southeast Asian routes to connect with them; after that, the exchanges with European and American countries will also become closer and closer. The opening of European and American routes also needs to be actively carried out.</p>
<p>The issue of Japanese compensation and restrictions on merchant ship tonnage is attracting attention from all parties. To prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor again, its merchant ship tonnage must be restricted so that it does not exceed one million tons. Japan's coastline is shorter than China's, and merchant ships are the backing of the navy. If Japan is allowed to possess more merchant ships than China, it will inevitably threaten the safety of China and other countries. On the day of commemorating China's Maritime Day, we are particularly concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>The above four points are the main points that we should put forward on China's first Maritime Day. The 450 million Chinese people have infinite love for their beautiful rivers and mountains, and although we have encountered many hardships, we can only strengthen everyone's determination to fight. Yes, the spirit of navigation is originally the spirit of perseverance, hard work, and unremitting progress. As long as the whole country has a nautical mind, everyone knows that using the ocean is the foundation of building and strengthening the country, and everyone is determined to promote the development of marine affairs in all aspects, then the brilliance of the Chinese nation will surely be even more brilliant!</p>
<h3>Suzhou Embezzlement of Prisoner Food Case: Yin Renyi Detained and Involved in Litigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] In Wuxian County, this city, the allocation of prisoner food was reduced due to embezzlement, arousing public anger among the prisoners and almost causing a prison riot. The prisoners had previously sent representatives to jointly file a complaint with the Suzhou Higher Prosecutor's Office, which is still under investigation. Afterwards, Ding Baocheng, the deputy warden of the prison, entertained reporters and denied that there was embezzlement of prisoner food. However, due to the unanimous opinions, it was difficult to conceal the facts. On the 29th of last month, Ding suddenly detained Yin Renyi, the director of the kitchen, for two days and two nights, strictly interrogating him and accusing him of embezzling prisoner food. Yin's son submitted a statement to the Wudi Prosecutor's Office, accusing Warden Ding of fabricating evidence, shifting the blame to staff, illegally detaining him, and coercing a confession, requesting a hearing. The whole case has become more complicated.</p>

<h3>Please Look at the Suffering People of Fuzhou Enduring Summer in a Double Abyss: White-Haired Old Man Enacts Tragedy, Embracing Grandson and Jumping into River to Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 9th] Summer, in the eyes of a few in the city, is a season for leisure and enjoyment. However, what summer brings to this vast ancient capital of Fujian is distress and suffocation – the threat of summer! Since the beginning of summer, "water" and "fire," successive unfortunate disasters, have turned most of the kind people from poor to destitute.</p>
<p>Great Disaster Arrives Within Ten Days: In just ten days, four-fifths of the city became a watery expanse. Of the 330,000 population, more than 250,000 were affected by the disaster. The number of deaths, collapsed houses, and property losses is still unknown. Originally, the government should have quickly come up with measures to deal with the aftermath and provide emergency relief. Let's look at two or three things after the disaster: The "Fujian Provincial Flood Relief Committee" was born a few days after the flood. Chairman Liu even hired Speaker Ding of the Provincial Assembly and General Sa as directors. Later, after being supported by the locals, he also took on the title of chairman. But before that, how many disaster-stricken people had died, starved, or become homeless? How many were shedding tears and weeping blood? The rescue and shelter work was undertaken by local charitable organizations. Among them, the supply of rice depended on the government, but what effect did the wet rice allocated by the Food Bureau have on relieving the disaster victims? When the relief committee was established, Chairman Liu took the lead in donating one hundred million yuan, which is worthy of thanks from the common people. However, looking back at the situation of the relief for the Hunan disaster in the past, why not take out the past spirit to launch a Fujian disaster relief effort?</p>
<p>Post-Disaster Prices Rise Alarmingly: The post-disaster prices have risen especially crazily, making most people breathless with shock. The speed of inflation has naturally increased as a result. The Provincial Government Statistics Office announced that the general price index for Fuzhou City in June was 1,055,790 times higher, including food items 908,891 times higher (of which, grain was 1,031,511 times higher, and other food items were 878,448 times higher), clothing 1,622,054 times higher, fuel 1,179,851 times higher, building materials 907,986 times higher, metal and electrical materials 829,906 times higher, and miscellaneous items 967,620 times higher. The retail price index was 1,110,083 times higher, an average increase of more than 91% compared to May. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the price of rice in Fuzhou was more than 6 million yuan per picul. After the festival, it rose to 9 million yuan. Who would have thought that the price of rice after the disaster would break the 10 million mark, then 20 million yuan, and reach 28 million yuan? The petty citizens were terrified by this crazy surge! When the price of rice hovered around the 10 million mark, some people believed that the early rice in northern Fujian was about to hit the market, and the price of rice was at its last glimmer of hope, with no possibility of further increase. According to past experience, February and March were the "difficult times." Therefore, some nervous rice merchants did not dare to buy in large quantities. However, the early rice in northern Fujian still had not hit the market, and the daily supply of 2,000 piculs of rice in Fuzhou City did not decrease as a result. In addition, the price of grain in various cities and counties in southern Fujian rose sharply, and the grain from the lower Yangtze flowed to the sea nearby. The rice from the upper reaches was snatched up and transported overseas before it even reached the Fuzhou docks. The sources of supply from the upper and lower reaches were cut off, and the amount of consumption remained the same. From 9 million yuan, it broke through the 10 million mark in two days. This flood affected nearly 30 cities and counties in the province, and the losses in rural areas were particularly severe. The early rice harvest was completely hopeless, and the late rice was damaged by about 50% or more. As a result, the recent surge in rice prices has gained a very good excuse.</p>
<p>Grain Stabilization Actually Increases Prices: All prices have risen, and the rice shop owner's words are the market price. You have to pay as much as they ask! In theory, since the price of rice has reached such an unmanageable situation, the government authorities should come up with concrete measures to stabilize the rising trend. However, the reality is not so. The "Grain Stabilization Store" does not carry out a large-scale sale, but instead "raises the price." The grain loans borrowed from the Central Bank, those who have used them to purchase grain, have never been distributed to the common people. The long-rumored "grain allocation" has not been realized to this day.</p>
<p>Under the high pressure of life, the number of hungry people is increasing every day, and incidents of jumping into the river, hanging oneself, selling wives, and selling children are heard every day. In these years, it is pitiful for pessimistic people to embark on the path of suicide. However, their escape from reality and adoption of this negative behavior is, in theory, not an irrational act. But seeing an old white-haired man at Cangqian Bridge hugging a three-year-old grandson and committing suicide by jumping into the river due to the pressure of life is enough to make people sad!</p>
<p>Natural and man-made disasters, water and fire coming at the same time, the consequences caused by this double abyss are unimaginable. After experiencing these double disasters, everything that people had left, everything that could be eaten has been eaten, and everything that could be sold has been sold. Facing this critical moment of life and death, can anyone think of a way for them to get through this merciless summer? (Historical Traces)</p>

<h3>Off-Site Trading Suffers a Blow, All Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up, Foreign Stocks Unable to Trade Due to Inconvenient Meetings</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Garrison Department made every effort to crack down on off-site trading of Chinese stocks. However, as idle funds continued to gather from various sources, small-cap stocks and miscellaneous stocks shone first, creating a buying frenzy. Some who had shorted Wing On Cotton in the off-site market also bought in to cover their positions due to the tense environment. Although off-site trading ceased trading against the exchange, it was decided that only one-tenth of the transactions would be settled each day according to the number of accounts. Agent fees opened at the original price, while trading inside the exchange was increasingly excited. From Xinhua Department Store, which is about to increase its capital, to Guohuo, after 11 o'clock, the entire market was in the red. After Wing On Cotton rose to the limit of 5,755 yuan, it struggled slightly and continued to trade at a premium, reaching a new high of over 6,020 yuan, and finally struggled around 5,900 yuan. The police authorities patrolled the various trading houses and cut off telephone lines regardless of whether they were approved or not. Next week's trading is bound to be concentrated in the exchange. Wing On Cotton's direction will depend on the strength of the long and short positions. Small-cap stocks and miscellaneous stocks are bound to be even more popular. Chuansin large notes will be listed for circulation on the 5th, and people's hearts are easily stirred.

<p>Textile Construction Plan, Exchange Yarn for Cotton</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to effectively purchase cotton and tide over the period between harvests this year, the Textile Construction Company intends to exchange yarn and cloth products with farmers for raw cotton. The exchange rate will not be rigidly stipulated in advance but will be determined temporarily at the time of the transaction. This plan is being discussed by senior officials of the company and a decision can be made in the coming days. At present, the area for purchasing raw cotton is becoming narrower, and the difficulties in capital turnover have been overcome. However, farmers generally lack confidence in the value of legal tender and insist on paying in silver dollars when purchasing, which has caused technical difficulties. The Textile Construction Company's plan to exchange yarn for cotton is aimed at this point, because trading in silver dollars is not permitted by law, so it is replaced by barter.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, in order to crack down on bounced checks and the abuse of promissory notes by banks, sent personnel in batches to inspect the banks and found that customers of the banks borrowed promissory notes or issued bounced checks first to exchange for promissory notes, and then deposited funds to make up for them, or the banks did not record the development of promissory notes on the same day but recorded them on the day the promissory notes were recovered, and they allowed customers to use them without signing a loan agreement.

<h3>Lackluster Exports of Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to understand the recent situation of Chinese tea exports, the reporter specifically visited a tea tycoon. According to reports, there are still sales of precious eyebrows and other green teas in French North Africa, but the number is very small. The situation in other places is still showing no improvement. The reason for this is that after the domestic production costs have increased day by day, the price of tea is more upside down than the price of tea abroad. In addition, Japan, a defeated country, is frequently recovering with the assistance of the United States, and the export of tea is especially on the rise. It is said that it will continue to export in bulk soon, most of which will sell well in the United States, while the rest will be promoted to Europe and Africa. According to the current situation, if our country's tea is still allowed to be destroyed, it may be on the verge of extinction.</p>

Bromwich is 30 years old and of short stature, which is also one of the reasons for his disadvantage.</p>
<p>In the men's doubles, the American Tom Brown and Molloy won the finals by defeating the Swede Berglin and the Australian Ha Oil 1-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 8-6, and will compete with the Australian Bromwich and Segman for the championship. In mixed doubles, Bromwich and Miss White of the United States defeated Chegut Lobni and Mrs. Dute of the United States 5-7, 6-1, 8-6. Australian Segman and Miss Hurd of the United States defeated the American Tom Brown and Mrs. DuPont 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, and will compete for the championship. The Bromwich and White team were the champions of the previous mixed doubles.</p>
<p>The women's doubles is still dominated by American ladies. Miss White and Mrs. DuPont defeated Mrs. Lebani and Miss Scotfield 7-5, 6-0. Another team, Mrs. Dute and Miss Hurd, defeated the British Mrs. Postock and Mrs. Bly 6-4, 8-6. The White-DuPont team and the Dute-Hurd team will compete for the championship.</p>

<h3>The Ragtag Team Is No Match; Red Socks Defeat All-Star Team; The Two Teams Will Meet Again This Afternoon at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Philippine baseball champion Red Socks team defeated the All-Star team with an overwhelming posture at the American Tongji Public School yesterday afternoon, with a score of seven to one. Before the game, the American and Philippine consuls-general performed the opening ceremony, and the 60-member orchestra led by the famous conductor Kang Tuolesi and Arlainasi of this city came to the venue to accompany the game. After the game, Thomas, Chairman of the American Overseas Chinese Association and Manager of Citibank, presented the award, a large silver cup, to the Philippine team.</p>
<p>The All-Star team is purely a ragtag bunch, and the performance was out of sync. Moreover, the pitchers McLay of the Air Force and Hanni Sansky of the Army were both out of sorts, and the performance was far inferior to that of Yu Changluan of Zhonghua. Compared with Zhonghua, the whole team, except for being slightly better in attack, was inferior in defense due to a lack of tacit understanding. In the second inning, two Red Socks players had already been eliminated, but they were still able to score four consecutive points by taking advantage of the repeated errors of the All-Star team inside and outside the field. In the third inning, McLay again frequently threw wild pitches, losing two more points, and fell into a big defeat. In the seventh inning, Ogaawa managed to break the duck for the All-Star team by taking advantage of the repeated mistakes of Gu Anga and Reid. The scores of each inning are as follows:</p>
<p>All-Star 〇〇〇〇〇〇一〇〇一一</p>
<p>Inning (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)</p>
<p>Red Socks 〇四二一〇〇〇〇〇一七</p>
<p>The Red Socks and All-Star teams are scheduled to meet again at the Racecourse at 3:00 PM this afternoon to celebrate American Independence Day, and U.S. Navy Commander Olish will be invited to preside over the opening ceremony and award ceremony. At the same time, the Philippine Overseas Chinese Orchestra conducted by Javia will also come to the venue to accompany and cheer the game. The performance of the All-Star team in the first game was far from the standard, and today's lineup will be adjusted to seek revenge. The pitcher will be Yu Changluan, who was the most praised in the first game.</p>
<h3>Gongzhan Cup Middle School Basketball Tournament: John and Xinjian Will Compete for the Championship; This Afternoon at 2:00 PM at the City Gymnasium; Minli Wins the Women's Group Championship</h3>
<p>The Gongzhan Cup Middle School Basketball League, sponsored by the City Gymnasium, has been competing for more than two months since it opened on April 24. Yesterday, four teams in the men's division competed for the finals. In the first game, Xinjian and Guangdong East were evenly matched in the preliminary round, and the scores were close. In the second half, Guangdong East lacked stamina and lost to Xinjian. The second game was John against City West. It turned out that John was the champion of last year's Yuxiu Cup, and City West was weaker. Although they tried their best to resist, they were eventually defeated by John. The third game was Minli against Nanmo in the women's division. The championship was determined by a three-game two-win system. Minli had already won the first game. Yesterday, the two teams fought again to determine who would win the championship. Although the forwards of Nanmo were still qualified in the first half, the guards were weaker. Minli was full of strength, and as a result, they won again and won the women's group championship. Today, Xinjian and John will compete for the men's championship, which is the last tense scene, and there will be a wonderful performance. The results of yesterday's games and today's final schedule are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Western Films No Longer Coming to China</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>For the past few days, newspapers have been reporting that Western films may no longer be imported to China. The reason is that Western film companies believe that the ticket prices set by the cinemas are too low, and the portion that is "split" with domestic film companies, when converted to foreign exchange, is minimal, resulting in no profit and even losses. Logically, cinemas should be on the same side as film companies when it comes to raising ticket prices. However, this time it is different. Although cinema ticket prices have been slightly increased, the cinema industry absolutely refuses to adopt the method of selling tickets at prices adjusted for the cost of living compared to pre-war prices, even at the risk of a complete breakdown with the Western film industry. It is said that the two sides are still at a standstill.</p>
<p>The cinema industry's refusal to "fully raise" ticket prices is actually a very insightful and clever move. With the depreciation of the legal tender, cinemas have already been doing "big bargain" business for the past few months. How could the cinema industry not understand this? How could they not want to make more money! However, they are facing two difficulties:</p>
<p>First, the general purchasing power has decreased significantly. Most people are worried about food and clothing and have very little spare money to watch movies. The lives of most people can no longer be "rationalized," so cinema ticket prices cannot be "rationalized" either. Movies can only rely on "selling in large quantities." What's the point of setting ticket prices at five million or ten million yuan when there are only "a few cats and dogs" in the theater!</p>
<p>Second, the production quality of Hollywood films has deteriorated significantly. The American film industry has publicly admitted that the current standard is far inferior to British films. In today's world, which is experiencing a "gold standard panic," the sales of American films in European countries have plummeted. Britain, which has always had a close relationship with the United States due to their shared language and culture, and was the largest customer of American films, has recently strictly limited the import of American films in order to save US dollars, and this has even caused dissatisfaction from the American diplomatic authorities. In this unprecedented "adverse situation," the profits of the American film industry are so small that they dare not rashly produce "million-dollar epics" or "all-star extravaganzas." Anyone who carefully observes the style of American films after the war will surely see the signs of "dare not spend money"—the quite successful "The Killers," for example, is entirely performed by second- or third-rate actors. Originally, "not spending much money" does not necessarily mean "not good," but unfortunately, Hollywood's art is the art of "money." Films like "The Killers" are rare occurrences, and can only be regarded as miracles.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason why cinema ticket prices cannot soar like rice prices in the last two weeks is not due to a lack of effort, but because they have their own difficulties. But does the Western film company have the determination to stick to the end? Probably not. The origin of "killing the chicken to get the eggs" does come from abroad, and they should know this.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, although Hollywood films often use pornography as a selling point, and often kill good original works with vulgar techniques, they do have their own indelible achievements. Biographies like "Wilson," and Disney's cartoons, should all be immortal. It would be a pity if they really stopped coming. However, don't the Chinese have a saying: "A loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise?"</p>
<p>First of all, we can easily think of the Chinese film industry. If Western films really stop coming, it should naturally be the time for domestic films to dominate. Moreover, domestic films have indeed made progress. For example, "Fake Phoenixes," "Sunny Day," and "A River of Spring Flows Eastward," have all made significant progress in terms of technique and consciousness. The future is promising. As long as they continue to work hard, they will definitely achieve results.</p>
<p>However, can Chinese films really attract all the Western film audiences (we are only talking about the Chinese audience of Western films)? To be honest, probably not—at least not in the short term. In this regard, the only thing that can fill the vacuum left by Western films is spoken drama.</p>
<p>The achievements of the Chinese spoken drama scene in the past seven or eight years have been unprecedented. Taking the spoken dramas performed in Shanghai as an example, those translated or adapted from foreign plays include Barrie's "The Admirable Crichton" (the direct translation is "Worthy Crichton," I remember that the full translation was serialized in "Fiction Monthly" or "Literature" ten years ago), Gorky's "The Lower Depths," and Shakespeare's "Macbeth." Is the adapted name of "Macbeth" called "Hero in Troubled Times"? I can't remember clearly. What is even more gratifying are the scripts created by Chinese people, such as Ding Xilin's "Miaofeng Mountain," Chen Baichen's "Promotion Chart," Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," Fei Mu's "Red Dust" (I think "Red Dust" is better than "Six Records of a Floating Life"), and Wu Zuguang's "Song of Righteousness"—truly a series of masterpieces, showing a thriving scene. Unexpectedly, when the flood of Hollywood films came, they became eclipsed and suffered a great loss. If Western films do not come, the revival of spoken drama is inevitable. To use an analogy, the standard of our spoken drama has gradually qualified to participate in the "World Games." Taking this opportunity to refuel and make rapid progress, isn't it great!</p>

<p>All my schoolmates presented poems to Paosou at the banquet</p>
<p>After the chaos, we meet again with half our hair white,</p>
<p>Thank you for your kindness in inviting us to the building.</p>
<p>Ten years of separation is like a dream,</p>
<p>A hundred tribulations weigh heavily on our hearts.</p>
<p>Ancient and modern times churn as the sea changes,</p>
<p>Life and death intertwine as the great river flows.</p>
<p>Your rare age is a testament to your vitality,</p>
<p>Do not worry about minor illnesses and live in seclusion.</p>
<p>Old classmates of many years, our friendship fading,</p>
<p>Distant stars scattered in the darkness.</p>
<p>Our bodies drift together like duckweed,</p>
<p>Our eyes have seen Penglai Mountain change color several times!</p>
<p>The world's plans require dedication to the Dao,</p>
<p>Admire your family traditions and respectful conduct.</p>
<p>Alas, I cling to the love of clouds and mist,</p>
<p>Growing old in the empty mountains of Ziyun Cave. (I am currently staying at Ziyun Cave in West Lake to escape the summer heat.)</p>
<p>Sending a letter from Ziyun Cave to congratulate Paosou on his seventieth birthday</p>
<p>We studied together at Rongjiang in the past,</p>
<p>How many times has the world changed on a traveler's boat?</p>
<p>You are three years older but still vigorous,</p>
<p>I am still staying in two caves. (There is Louxia Cave next to Ziyun Cave.)</p>
<p>May your children and grandchildren be wealthy and happy,</p>
<p>May your writings and fame surpass your peers.</p>
<p>May people from north and south of Taishan pray for you,</p>
<p>I raise my golden cup towards Lianhu Lake from afar.</p>
<p>The waters of Lianhu Lake are comparable to West Lake,</p>
<p>The scenery is like a painted ridge.</p>
<p>The people's suffering from taxes requires urgent relief,</p>
<p>When will the country be safe and the roads smooth?</p>
<p>Cherish the chrysanthemums of Zimei and Tao Qian,</p>
<p>The idle clouds and Zhang Han's perch beyond the world.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the moonlight is bright and clear,</p>
<p>Human joys are enough for enjoyment.</p>
<h3>Supplemental Writings · Painting Cleaning</h3>
<p>— Yuchuang</p>
<p>"Mr. Harlap, please come over immediately. I broke that oil painting by Rembrandt. What will I do if my husband finds out?"</p>
<p>At midnight, Harlap, America's most famous restorer of all kinds of paintings, received this phone call. The caller was the wife of a famous collector in New York. Harlap had seen this famous masterpiece by Rembrandt, and he also knew that the painting was bought for $35,000.</p>
<p>(The Resurrection of a Famous Painting - From right to left in the picture: (1) is a mediocre portrait; (2) after X-ray irradiation, it was found that there was another shoulder on the left shoulder of the portrait, and a shadow of a hand in the lower right corner; (3) after the original portrait was washed off with medicine, the face of the woman in the original painting was still faintly visible; (4) The "painting washing" is completed, and it turns out that there is a genuine work by the famous Italian painter Murillo hidden here! This painting is worth $35,000.)</p>
<p>He rushed to his customer's house and saw that there was a crack between the nose and mouth of the figure in the painting. The young lady told him in tears that her husband had repeatedly told her not to move these picture frames when he left, but she had accidentally dropped the most valuable painting while moving the furniture. Her husband was returning to New York from another city tomorrow morning and would definitely be furious.</p>
<p>Harlap hurriedly took the painting to his studio and worked all night. By the time the sky was about to dawn, the painting had been returned to its owner, well repaired and hung on the wall. Only a microscope could reveal the traces of repair.</p>
<p>He first carefully examined the canvas of the original painting, and then selected another canvas of the exact same thickness and "wove" it into the crack in the painting. Then he imitated the brushstrokes and colors of the original work and carefully painted it. The result was truly "seamless." Six months later, the collector happily sold the painting for $40,000, and the new owner never discovered that the painting had been "patched." The person most grateful to Harlap was naturally the collector's wife, who gave him a gold watch pendant inlaid with diamonds to express her gratitude.</p>
<p>Harlap also often "washed" paintings. He often takes an ordinary painting and X-rays it first. As a result, he often finds that there is another painting underneath, and sometimes the one underneath is even a valuable masterpiece. So he gently rubs a secretly mixed medicine on the painting, and as a result, the oil painting on the top layer is quickly "washed" off, and the painting below immediately sees the light of day again. However, extreme care must be taken when using this medicine, otherwise even the oil paint on the bottom layer will be washed off.</p>
<p>Recently, a poor Italian woman took a worthless 17th-century book to Harlap's studio. She wanted to sell the painting cheaply to Harlap in order to get money to pay for her son's tuition. Harlap was temporarily inspired and X-rayed the painting. As a result, he found that there was indeed another painting underneath. After "washing" it, it turned out to be a work by the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea del Sarto! The poor mother was overjoyed, and Harlap was also happy and smiling.</p>
<p>Why would a famous painting be painted over with an ordinary painting by a mediocre painter? Harlap said that perhaps people wanted to avoid tariffs when smuggling these masterpieces abroad, so they "disguised" them. There are also other reasons. For example, during the reign of Queen Victoria in England, it was stipulated that all nude paintings must be repainted with clothing to maintain morality, and even nude winged cherubs were not allowed to be painted, and previously painted ones were not allowed to be preserved. As a result, people had to repaint something on them.</p>
<p>Harlap's skills in repairing paintings are not limited to this. Sometimes, a painting is so old and dilapidated that it cannot be washed or repaired. He takes it and stretches it on a specially made easel, with the painted side facing down. He first wets the upward side (the back of the painting), and then suddenly takes out a very sharp small knife and scratches the canvas (oil paintings are painted on canvas) in a burst of disorder, gently peeling it off! He said that people who paint oil paintings always add a layer of gelatinous substance to the canvas first, and then add the color. What he is now scraping off is the canvas! However, he never damages the extremely thin layer of gelatinous substance, so the original painting is not damaged at all.</p>
<p>Then, on the extremely thin gelatinous membrane on the easel, he applies a specially made strong glue. Before the glue dries, he has already glued a new canvas that has been prepared, and then carefully irons out the wrinkles with a special 20-pound heavy iron. Finally, he clamps the painting tightly in a clip that is extremely heavy on both sides. In this way, the painting has been "reborn." Then he gently wipes the front of the painting with medicine to remove the dirt accumulated over the years, and the life of a painting is extended by decades.</p>
<h3>Architectural Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Songpu</p>
<p>In Sverdlovsk, Russia, there is a road paved with crushed jade, topaz, and malachite, which is truly beautiful and rare. It is also said that in Kimberley, South Africa, there is a road inlaid with diamonds, worth more than five million gold dollars.</p>
<p>An American car company has a building entirely made of glass. Customers do not have to enter, and they can see everything at a glance from the outside. It is even more beautiful at night. When the strong colorful lights are shone on it, it is brilliant and dazzling, as if watching a colorful movie.</p>
<h3>Qingxue Garden Reader</h3>
<p>The name of the newly appointed Vice President of the Examination Yuan, Jia Jingde, is very familiar. I don't know if he is from Shanxi. If he is registered in Sanpu, then he should be a "Jinshi Gong" from the Jiachen year, who has served as the "County Magistrate" of Tancheng County. [Editor's note: Mr. Jia is indeed from Qinshui County, Shanxi, and has served as the magistrate of Zhaoyuan, Tancheng, and other counties."]</p>
<p>The Jiachen year (the thirtieth year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty) was the last imperial examination. The imperial examinations of the Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties ended here. There were many celebrities on the list. The first place, Tan Yankai, the Huiyuan, whose courtesy name was Zu'an, was the youngest son of the former Guangdong Governor Tan Zhonglin, whose posthumous title was Wengong. He was soon admitted to the Hanlin Academy. He contributed to the Republic of China and served in important positions in the frontier and central government. In addition, there were famous reporter Huang Weiji (Yuanyong), famous painter Yao Hua, various religious scholars Dr. Chen Huanzhang, and Wang Yitang, the big-bearded pseudo-North China Committee Chairman who is now in prison in Beiping. This person's original name on the list was Zhiyang," later changed to "Geng," and then changed to his courtesy name because he had the same name as "another Wang Geng." He was also a Jinshi in the Jiachen year, and also led (the Examination Yuan; but the "pseudo-Yuan" during the occupation period.</p>
<p>The four chief examiners of the Jiachen Hui examination were Yu De, Zhang Baixi, Lu Runxiang, and Dai Hongci. Zhang Baixi was from Hunan, the same province as Tan, and they had a family friendship. When he saw Zu'an's paper (the policy essay was reformed, without copying, the handwriting was easy to recognize), he said that this was from our Hunan aristocratic family, and the article was also particularly good, so it could be designated as the Huiyuan. The chief examiner, Yu De, was Zhang's younger generation in the Hanlin Academy and happily agreed, and Tan Yankai became the first person on the entire list. The meaning and writing of that "Neutral and not leaning, how strong is the correction" were truly outstanding and extraordinary. (It was during the Russo-Japanese War, and the Qing government announced its neutrality. The topic hinted at the current situation.)</p>
<p>After the Gengzi Rebellion, the Qing government promoted reform. The imperial examination was abolished, and the examination was changed to test Confucian classics and policy essays. Candidates were allowed to discuss Chinese and foreign politics and current affairs, regardless of the old-fashioned lectures. It was considered a landmark progress in the old examination system, but it was only held for two examinations (two provincial and two metropolitan examinations), and then the imperial examination was completely abolished (special talents were cultivated from schools). Xu Shichang of Shuizhu Village was a Hanlin in the Bingxu year. He had been in the Hanlin Academy for more than ten years and had never judged papers. It was not until the Jiachen year that he was sent to participate in the court examination paper judging as a cabinet scholar. Therefore, in the preface he wrote in the Jiachen year, he said: "The examination of policy essays was first set in the Yin year (the Renyin provincial examination, policy essays were used for the first time), and the imperial examination system suddenly ended in the Chen year. I obtained the position of assistant examiner in this examination. In the Hanyuan Hall, I once saw the holding of the golden mirror; in front of the Guangfan Gate, I carefully counted the rows of morning bells. Ma Rong in his later years only loved the sound of the zither; Xu Yan's remaining teeth still thought of eating cakes." His words were full of joy and also full of sadness and attachment. It was precisely "The tea blossom has bloomed, the season is over, and the garden is full of cuckoos crying." It's over, it's over, everything is over!</p>
<p>Lu Jianxiang (Fengshi) was one of the last Zhuangyuan of Suzhou, also one of the last Zhuangyuan prime ministers of all dynasties, and also one of the people who personally presided over the last imperial examination, witnessing the "death" of the imperial examination.</p>
<p>President Zhang Boling of the Examination Yuan is an old doctor and a senior person who runs Nankai School. Vice President Jia is a famous Jinshi who succeeded in the old imperial examination. Yan Fanlao (Xiu), who first founded "Nankai," was a senior Hanlin in the Guiwei year and a pioneer in developing new education by running schools in the north. Then, when Zhang and Jia serve as the heads of the Examination Yuan, they should extract the essence from the old and new examination systems. Will they live up to our expectations?</p>
