<h3>津浦路戰局日見開展　南北國軍會師在卽　澮河南岸痛殲劉匪主力</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠四日電〕當面戰局已呈開展迹象，黃維兵團渡北淝河進擊後，刻仍在澮河南岸距宿縣以南四十餘華里之處，與匪激戰中。南下兵團今已越過夾溝，迫近符離集，其西翼亦攻抵瞧溪口。蚌埠正面之李劉兩兵團，今在曹老集以北地區續有進展。據空軍偵察報告，三路大軍之個別距離，均約爲八十華里，今日軍方相吿，當面戰况如按照預定步驟發展，孫黃兩兵團至遲於後日可會師。</p>
<p>〔本戰蚌埠四日電〕今日此間當面戰况如下：國軍右翼劉兵團進抵解河南岸園宅集，正面李兵團某部在仁和集附近殲匪六縱隊之一個偵察營，　獲亦多。該縱隊之第十八師一個團，於老曹老集（在曹老集車站西偏北約七華里）頑抗，亦爲國軍加緊圍殲中。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠四日電〕據悉：黃維兵團前曾在澮河南岸某一縱績僅四公里之陣地中，對來犯之劉匪主力展開全綫攻擊，現已轉爲有利情勢，在該部當而幾均每日殲匪三千人以上，數日來擊潰匪已達三萬餘人。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕軍息：皖北淝河澮河流域洪澤湖以西地區國軍，以津浦鐵路爲主軸之殲戰，己益趨有利，蚌埠西北雙域集方面國軍黃維兵團，挾優勢火力，對匪劉伯飛股主力予以痛殲，血戰兼旬，傷斃匪兩萬餘，刻黃維兵團正與越湘河北上之劉汝明·李延年兩大兵團並肩向越固鎭北逃之陳劉兩股匪作果敢追擊，國軍邱淸泉·李彌·孫元良兵團由徐州剿匪副總司令杜聿明指揮，自徐州南下，三日晨主動撤離徐州·越津浦終夾溝以壓倒優勢，在五柳集孫莊地區（均北距宿縣八十餘華里）擊潰匪陳毅第三·第十·第十六縱隊，殘匪不支，奪路向豫東方面竄去。陳毅股匪快速·第十三·十一·三縱隊尙岡在津浦綫符離集頑抗，國軍續予南北合力夾擊中。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠四日電〕淮北國軍今又獲進展，正面及兩翼均躍近固鎭五至十公里不等，續殲滅陳匪第六縱隊之後衛一個營。此間剿總秘書長劉子淸少將吿記者：旬餘以來，各路國軍用「以大吃小戰術」，每日均消耗陳劉匪部至少一個團，此種積小勝爲大勝之必然趨勢，將使陳劉匪於無聲無臭之中自趨沒落。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕軍息：四日天氣晴朗，我空軍整日出動，協助地面部隊對澮河北岸自固鎭逃出之殘匪猛施轟炸，匪傷亡慘重，紛以小股三五百成羣奪路向西北方逃命。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廣播：中國國防部頃發表公報，略稱：淮河區域之共匪，現經國軍自南北二方面加以壓力，已向河南省東部平原退却。又據官方透露：國軍已在華中戰塲增援大軍十萬，以期堅守蚌埠，拱衛首都。該公報又稱：陳毅及劉伯承部共軍十個縱隊，正自淮河向西北方之臨渙集，永城，簫縣等處移動，戰事亦已移往該地區。共軍移動之目的，顯欲整頓殘部，重加郃署。過去十日來，在宿縣附近戰鬥中，共軍死傷約二萬人，國軍損失約七千人。該公報並承認徐州已於星期五自動撤守。</p>
<h3>匪軍目前行動　牽制重於進擊　津浦路搶修隨軍前進</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠四日電〕根據軍方最近決定之部署，蚱宿戰局即將有所開展，在此戰塲中，匪之主力爲劉伯承·陳賡部七個縱隊，及陳毅部比較完整之第二·六·十一·十三等縱隊，以上各匪，均係在徐州會戰中未受重大打擊者。軍方認爲匪尙在此間頑抗之一因，爲牽制國軍不能於徐州會戰結束後即開始追剿，而使陳毅之殘破部隊有休息整理之機會，故匪目前行動，其作用爲牽制重於進擊。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕首都人士今日對於華東戰事表示樂觀，咸謂徐州南下國軍倘與共軍發生主力戰而獲勝，戰局至少可以穩定兩三個月。共軍陳毅部隊上月初在徐州東面進攻受挫，此次倘再失利，即將一蹶不振。向時華中國軍生力部隊約三萬五千名，已開到南京區增援，大江沿岸原已駐有雄軍四萬，拱衛天險。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕政府方面四日談稱：華中國軍十五萬人，業已調至津浦綫南段，參加蚌埠北面之戰爭。一般僉信共軍刻在徐州周圍重行部署，企岡發動另一攻勢。現國軍與共軍雙方正以增援部隊調赴至蚌埠宿縣準備決戰。據半官方訊：前淞滬抗日名將宋希濂將軍業巳抵蚌埠，統率四個大軍，約佔計實力在十萬人左右，鎭守重鎭。自徐州南下國軍之三個軍有十八萬人之多，向宿縣推進中。蚌埠固鎭間共軍已吿肅淸。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕澮河前綫共軍今日正向北退却，應付徐州南下兵團之壓迫。南下兵團共約二十五萬之衆，已推批約四十哩，僅遭遇共軍微弱抵抗，再向西南推進三十哩，即可與北上大軍會師。</p>
<p>〔本報明光四日電〕匪軍被國軍强有力部隊進剿時，曾流竄至定遠縣西南六十里之吳家圩整補，現下池河·岱山鋪一帶已無匪踪</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕津浦路搶修工程隊以北上國軍進展順利，四日自蚌埠北上，隨同搶修，路局交通車刻通淝河岸邊曹老集</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠四日電〕我空軍於昨今兩日，向北面潰退之匪散發來歸證及吿匪軍書卅五萬份，勸導盲從匪衆早日投誠。</p>
<h3>淮陰未撤守　蘇北各地安謐</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕海總悉；江防部署早經完成，並已調集大批有力艦艇增强長江巡弋，以防殘匪竄擾，週來長江上游匪新一旅第十三團四百餘人，雖一度竄擾沙市附近之半月山，續犯江口（沙市上游）嗣經我駐防艦艇奮勇截擊，匪傷亡逾百，紛紛潰逃。至長江下游方面，天星　曾有小股匪部乘隙竄擾，經海軍艦艇協同自衛隊猛擊，斬獲頗多。蘇北沙溝附近時堡之匪高郵團約五百餘人，於二十九日拂曉，曾向我時堡自衛隊圍攻，一度進至時堡鎭街區核心陣地，與我自衛隊猛烈搏鬥，犯匪終在海軍壓倒之砲火下被殲滅逾半，殘匪不支潰退，時堡當卽收復。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕將夫三日於華爾德李特陸軍醫院，與馬歇爾商談三小時又四十五分之久，是爲蔣夫人抵美後與馬卿之第二次會晤。此次夫人並偕馬歇爾夫人與馬卿共進午餐於醫院中，馬卿刻住於陸軍醫院進行體格檢查。蔣夫人於上午十一時到達，於下午二時四十五分始辭出。出院時，迎候者詢其與馬卿第二次商談之結果如何，夫人答稱：余願見凡與馬歇爾元帥相見而不感興奮之人，據未經證實之消息稱：蔣夫人曾以我國局勢向馬卿作綜合之慨述，昨日之訪問，僅爲禮貌訪問性質。蔣夫人並稱：渠並無正式計劃，亦不確言下次將與何人會商，但已定於下週初晤杜魯門總統。夫人與馬卿於醫院中商談後，卽與馬卿夫人驅車返里斯堡馬歇爾寓邸。國務院稱，該院並不知悉蔣夫人是否再度訪馬卿於醫院，蔣夫人之特殊訪問馬歇爾於陸軍醫院與其進行會商，已引起外界極大之注意及推測，聞馬歇爾刻正與杜魯門總統密切討論我國局勢，聞助理國務卿羅維特昨日之訪杜魯門總統，主要與中國問題有關，但未能知其許。若千人士認爲，蔣夫人與杜魯門政府及民主黨領袖成立寳貴之聯繫，並供給有關我國局勢之最新情報。尤有進者，衆信蔣夫人將使杜總統及其政策擘劃者明暸在明年四月卽吿結束之援助計劃，以後繼續擬定援華計劃，並加强物炎與經濟援助，以遏止共產黨南進之必要性。蔣夫人將繼續留住里斯堡，度過週末，與杜總統會晤後，下週以前料無其他約會。</p>

<h3>工業自救</h3>
<p>— 徐可均</p>
<p>最近工業危機，日趨嚴重，勞資不安，糾紛時起，生產消沉，難期開展，蓋有末路之憂矣！十一月十五日發表工人生活指數爲八倍一，同月卅日又提高爲十五倍四，就工人方面生活需要言之，此項指數誠不爲高。然就工廠立塲言之，則成品銷路不暢，支出日形增多，實巳不堪負担。此種情形，尤以非日用品之機器製造業爲最甚。卽如筆者所參加之某有歷史之工程公司，經濟巨額透支，未來苦於籌劃，此可爲機器製造業目前困難之一例也。復查上月十五日至三十日，物價一致挫跌，此次提高指歡，或係前定太低，故加彌補。此半月間，工廠情形，更不景氣，出品滯銷，價格低落，支出驟增一倍，確已瀕於山窮水盡之境。或謂廠方應立卽請求工貸，藉資維持，其說亦是。廠方請求工貸，政府爲維護工業計，確應酌予核准。惟國庫不充，財源甚竭，勢必又將增發通貨，結果工廠未必蒙利，而流弊所及，徒增黃金搶購之風，影響社會秩序，亦至可慮。或議工廠旣難維持，不若辦理結束，事實上此時結束，更不可能。蓋若工廠關閉，將陷鉅額工人於失業，値此大局動盪之際，失業問題最爲嚴重，其將擾亂社會安寗，造成不良結果，殆可斷言。尤要者，工業爲國家社會之命脈，如人身之血脈然，必藉此而流通營養，乃能生長繁榮，若果工業停頓，無異自扼其吭，自絕其食，後患何堪設想！故關閉工廠，尤非上策。値此困境，吾人果將何以自救耶？管見以爲祗有工廠當局主持人以及技師工人，全體整個團結，齊心協力，方克度此難關，同獲生路。此有兩點基本認識，須先加以說明：</p>
<p>（一）工人作工之目的，係從事生產並期取得適當之報酬以維持其生活。現在酬報之方式，皆以金錢計算，蓋以金錢可交換生活必需品也。若金錢不能藉以交換或其交換價値日見减低時，則工人對於金錢酬報興趣消失，而願意實物補償或發給實物，俾獲交換，藉得所需，若能以實物補償，最爲穩妥。此一點，吾人須先認識。</p>
<p>（二）現代潮流，勞資時見失調，國人受此影響，亦右歧視辦工業者，恒目爲資本家或剝削者；此種觀念，亦屬錯誤。緣以吾國工業，尙屬萌芽時期，多數廠商，均係慘淡經營，內受變亂影響，外與國際競爭，其處境之艱苦，實難與他國情形相提並論。今再試就工廠當局主持人技師曁工人各方面列論之，覘其關係，果否對立。鄙見以爲工業旣係國家命脈，自屬非常重要；辦理工業者以其經騐所得，智能所及，經營工廠，盡其努力，使鉅量人力導入正軌，從事生產，造成福利，其貢獻價値甚大，生活方面亦無何逾格事受。至於投資取利之股東，根據近年來若干工廠官利紅利之詳細統計，所得至爲微小，事實不難明瞭。總之，一般工業主持人中，雖或不乏大資本者，究其多數，亦均能以事業爲重，未可一概置於剝削之列。至若工程師技師人員，則以體力腦力之勞動，助進廠務之開展，其確爲勞動份子，尤無疑義。綜上諸人之關係，若喩以家庭，則工廠之主持人，管理人，技師，可比長兄次兄；若喩以學校，可比校長敎員；工人則如家屬或學生。彼此關係密切，利害與共，無所謂界限，更不可有衝突。當此難關，若再誤認勞資雙方必須對立，不作危舟共濟之想，則必同陷絕境，難期福利。此點尤須先有明確之認識。</p>
<p>根據上述意見，爰建議自救方法如次：</p>
<p>（一）廠方　工廠負責人暨重要幹部，應卽召集工人，懇切談話，俾可切實了解現在環境，並將經濟完全公開，使當局所有誠意，所遇困難，工人完全明瞭，同下極大決心，在「祗要大家有飯吃」之口號下，一致努力加緊工作，加强生產。至於工人之每日伙食及生產必需原料，則工廠負責人應絕對設法辦到。糧食一層，必要時不妨在美援物資中磋商借用，以工廠現有成品或期貨成品作價交換，並可以晨村所需之機器如榨油機，打禾機，礦地所需機器，如打水　，弔車等，換取農產品或煤斤，以供日用。至原料一層，若乏款購進，亦應以現有成品或期貨成品交換。惟此種辦發必須政府予以積極支持與多方便利，負責祖保該項成品之交出信用，及其不再貶低之價値。吾人深信此乃政府對於工業界應有之責任，其助力或且遠超工貸之上，因無任何流弊也。此外如工廠方面需要小額購糧及原料資金，應請政府許以期貨成品向國家銀行拋售，藉以獲得資金，購買糧食或原料。</p>
<p>（二）工方　工人在此時期，必須獲得每天伙食及最低限度之零用，鑒於環境非常，儘量减低其生活欲望，並將應得工資折合成品，卽就其所創造之成品中，予以相當之一份。故工人目前雖無大量金錢收入，但將來必可獲得相當物資。就經濟意義言，如同强迫儲蓄，可隨市價，不患貶値，同時鼓勵增加生產，殊為有益。</p>
<p>管見以為此種辦法，最爲合理，定能收效。如可實行，無論任何困境，生產決可維持，不但創造人生福利，目的可達，且絕無刺激物價，搶購黃金諸流弊。工廠不致倒閉，工人可免失業，消滅社會危機，增加國家力量，福國利民，實有賴焉。惟本文所提，僅係原則，至實行時之具體辦法及技衛問題，自當需各方按實際情况詳加擬訂，方能切實允當·且個人理想未局，獨力難期著效，尙望諸同道者對此辦法，發生相當興趣，有以補充之而促成之。尤所切望者，政府掖進工業，素具熱忱，諸如對於拋售期貨，賒購原料時所出成品之期單，或工人之成品給予證，（例如某墨水廠工人工資一〇〇〇元，除去伙食二〇〇外，應得之八〇〇元折合墨水若干瓶，應由廠方付予證明文書一紙，此稱成品給予證，或所有權證），必須切實保證其有效與兌現，務使期單之通用，同於不貶値之籌碼，擢證之信念過於受限制之黃金。此種辦法如能推行順利，獲得良果，則由通貨所生之一切痛苦，工業界所蒙受之一切困難，悉將解除，諸可無慮。質之同道，以爲如何？</p>

<h3>香港居大不易　房荒嚴重·費用日高　投資無路「難民苦悶」</h3>

<h3>杜魯門總統推行新政　擬具社會福利計劃　救濟貧窮老弱提高教育費　注意人民健康並解決房荒</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕據可靠方面消息：杜魯門總統正計劃在內閣中增設一部，指導一大規模之社會福利計劃，使美國人民臻于更健康更愉快之境。此項部會之建立，將獲得國會之通過，觀察家認爲民主黨新國會必將予以支持。行政方面吿合衆社稱，杜魯門總統將要求國會建立新社會福利部，此項函件當在國會於明年一月三日開幕後立卽提出。與社會福利計劃密切關聯者，卽爲短期之房屋計劃。總統及其助手希望將房租管制，至少再網續一年，並由政府支持建築成本低房租低之房屋。在若干方面，杜魯門之社會福利計劃，且超過故羅斯福總統所提出者，計劃中包括：（一）擴展社會安全利益，遍及數百萬現在尙朱獲益之人民，提高貧窮者及年老者之補助金。（二）長期之全國健康計劃，包括健康保險，給予現在尙未能供給之數百萬人民之適當醫藥照顧，其目標在「擴展基本之健康服務，並使其能遍及全部人民」。（三）提高聯邦給予各州之建造醫院及其他醫學機關，以及醫學研究之補助金。（四）提高聯邦敎育補助費，包括學校房舍經費，敎師薪金及其他活動經費。（五）可能由政府給予醫學研究生補助金，以解決目前之醫師荒。官方宣稱，全國之醫師，僅佔需要額之百分之八十。如總統之計劃付諸執行，則政府之每年社會福利預算，又將增加數百萬元。按目前之預算已達十億之譜，但所須之費用，可能由增加之社會安全稅抵補。在本年會計年度中，國會已通過撥款十二億四千五百十六萬美元爲政府之社會福利及敎育活動費用，國會方面爲爲總統之增加要求，必能大部實現。</p>

<p>塔斯社此電包括下列數點：（一）蘇聯雖願供給情報，然對幣制之研究相當冷淡。（二）完全拒絕勃氏所主張之「斡旋」或「監督」委員會。（三）美法兩國曾宣稱貨幣專家應考慮最近之柏林局勢，塔斯社稱，「以過去數日內勃拉馬格里亞所提有關柏林之其他問題而言，蘇外次維辛斯基在安理會所發表之演說，卽可代表蘇聯對此種問題之答覆。」技離辛斯基表明之蘇聯態度如后；（一）安理會無權過問柏林問題；（二）柏林問題應由四佔領國解決。西方發言人稱，蘇方聲明對局勢毫無裨益，彼等以爲蘇聯一日不停止分裂柏林，勃氏之「最後嘗試」卽一日不能生效。西方現正起草輔助備忘錄準備提交各專家，詳舉蘇聯之行動，致柏林局勢無法令人容忍。</p>

<h3>共產勢力在亞洲</h3>
<p>— 礝石譯</p>
<p>本文作者弗洛曼Joseph　Fromm，是一個有經騐的記者，他是「美國新聞與世界報吿」雜誌的駐遠東特派訪員。自從第二次世界大戰結束以後，卽被派到遠東。他曾經遊歷過日本·華北·印度支那·印尼·馬來亞·緬甸和印度。在他的遊歷期內，曾經和各地的官員·士兵及政治家作過許多談話。現在，他在十月一日發表了這篇文字，把蘇聯在亞洲擴充勢力的情形，作一綜合的報道。</p>
<p>當共黨勢力在歐洲暫時平安一些下來，亞洲的共黨勢力却勃興了。自從以往六個月以來，共黨的勢力是擴充得很有成績。照這樣的成績看，亞洲是很有變成共黨的亞洲之可能，雖然沒有到明年或一年之後卽被達到目的的可能性，但是至少在五年十年之中，就可能彼完成目標。</p>
<p>同時美國在遠東的信譽和勢力，却在走向下坡。在日本·中國·菲列賓·印度支那·馬來亞·東印度·緬甸和印度，都是明顯地表示出美國和西方由於自誤而致在冷戰立塲上失去地位。在這擁有居民十萬萬人的廣大區域內，現在風行着國家主義和獨立運動。</p>
<p>美國和西方列强對於遠東沒有確定性之決策，這是使共然在亞洲成功的主因。當美國以大量援助日本的時候，煽動者就藉此向那些從前被日本佔領過的區域煽動。同時，他們從事鼓動各該地區的土人發動獨立運動以抗拒法國。英國和荷蘭。</p>
<p>由於壓迫·貧乏·農民的不能安居耕紜，於是國家主義和共產思想才因之產生。蘇聯就利用了這個弱點，在亞洲各地爭得了友朋，和培養了他的潛力。美國爲了爭得在歐洲的友誼，必須支持各殖民當局，於是蘇聯便利用了這一點，答允以各種各樣的方式，援助土人的反叛戰。</p>
<p>共黨當局在亞洲各國所發動的攻勢，其方式係隨環境而變易。在印度支那和印尼，共黨所採取的攻勢是民族主義運動，他們並且武裝了那些當對日戰爭結束後，夢想美國能支援他們的自由主義者。</p>
<p>在中國，共黨已握有居民一億五千萬人的區域。他們所發動的攻勢，是被大衆所讚成的所謂土地改革，並且鼓勵農民參加向地主淸算的戰爭。</p>
<p>在馬來亞，小組織的並且是有武力的共黨，向英國展開了慘烈的戰爭。那時，在緬甸的共黨也正領導着向社會主義政府反抗的武裝戰爭。</p>
<p>共黨亞洲情報局是這種運動的主使，蘇聯就趁勢培養各該區人民的反美情緒。在大戰結束初期，美國在亞洲是很有聲望的，但是現在是聲譽漸次下降了。</p>
<p>許多亞洲殖民地人民和其他人士，對於日本戰敗的局勢，原懷有一種希望，因爲根據四强宣言和太平洋憲草，殖民地人民是可以不再受壓迫，同時還可以獲得自治。由於戰時美國對亞洲的政策，這就使亞洲的人民深深地相信美國。他們以爲當和平來到的時候，美國會替亞洲的殖民地人民爭獨立自由的。</p>
<p>但是，戰後的美國外交是着重點於歐洲復興，和防止蘇聯勢力擴展到西歐，結果對於亞洲的一切決策，皆被美國當局列爲次要而常常謬步。雖然今日美國在亞洲是幾乎失盡了盟友，但是美國的外交政策還沒有回頭。世界上將有共黨天下的亞洲出現了，而美國似乎尙未覺察有這個未來的恫脅，目光祗關注在歐洲方面。　（未完）</p>

<h3>江亞輪起爆炸沉沒　三千旅客大半失蹤　生還約千人正查失事原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局滬甬綫班輪江亞號前日下四時自滬駛甬，晚七時許行至與淞口外里銅沙洋而，突然爆炸沉沒。全船三千旅客死傷大半。當晚迄昨日經各方協力援救，至昨晚止被救出抵滬者約有千人，葬身海底者確數尙無從統計。根據該局出售船票總數及可能外加之「黃魚」乘客數估計，喪生者約在二千人左右。至於出事原因，各方傳說紛紜，究屬如何，尚在調查中。</p>
<p>江亞輪係招商局接收日商東距海連株式會社興亞丸所改，為該局滬甬綫班輪中最宏大之一艘，速率每小時十四浬，船長三百四十呎四，闊五十呎，儎重二千零九十九噸，原有客位特等二十八，頭等三十六，二等四十六，三等五百五十五，四等五百七十一，共可容一千一百八十六人，經改裝後，航政局客牌可容二千二百五十人。</p>
<h3>船尾突起巨響　三分鐘內下沉</h3>
<p>此次自滬駛甬，共售出船票二千二百零七張，船員一百九十一人。前日下午四時啓碇，七時左右駛經橫沙西南白龍港東首之水道（東經三一·一五度，北緯一二一·四七度），船尾部份突然起轟然巨響，右側第三艙附近發生極度强烈之爆炸，電達後部三層台格。瞬息間船中直燈熄滅。馬達停止，尾部開始急遽下沉，三分鐘內卽沒入水中。船身中部及船頭亦繼之逐漸沉淪，船員發覺失事，已無從挽救，且因電台已燬，無法拍發求救　號。是時船中近爆炸部份之三　艙旅客大部已無發逃出，頭二等艙特等艙及甲板上四等旅客，　巨大爆炸聲所驚起，悉船已出　，目睹船身逐漸爲浪潮所呑噬，茫茫大海，漆黑一片，頓時驚　失措，哭喊慘呼，混亂中或紛紛跳入海中，或爭奪救生船逃命，或擁集船頭桅桿烟囱部份，面爲海浪捲去者不計其數。至最後關頭，全船僅餘前部最高台格尙露出水面，此時幸有華孚公司之華孚輪駛經該處，但黑暗中初尙未能發現江亞失事，旅經江亞輪上急用手電筒照發求救信號，始駛近援救，一面並由華孚輸代發求救信號。</p>
<p>接獲電報　派輪援救</p>
<p>招商局於當晚九時許接獲。此項電報後，立卽調派秋瑾，濟安，江靜，海津等四輪前往營救，並商請我國　軍派峨嵋號艦曁美國海軍亦派艦兩艘往救。同時更有金源利，茂利，等輪以及漁輪風帆船等駛經該處者，聞訊亦均前往援救。昨晨該局復派海事課課長范崙率領團强國山兩拖輪拖帶大鐵駁兩艘，帶同潛水夫及工人五十餘人趕往出事地點繼續撈救。</p>
<p>船員失蹤　六直餘人</p>
<p>截至昨晚止經各輪救出送滬之旅客約計千人，其中傷者已由該局分送公濟仁濟中美等醫院施救。高級船員中獲救者有船主沈達才，大副朱津昌輸機長胡彩揚，三管輸張慶芳，業務主任鄭守業，報務員土鉦。失蹤者大管輪汪聞潮，二管輸張福寳，主任報務員韓於成，低級船員失蹤者約六十餘人。</p>
<p>失事原因　猜測紛紜</p>
<p>關於失事經過情形，昨已由該輪船主呈報局方轉呈航政局，將予澈查失事原因。據船主稱，當駛抵出事地　時，在正前方航綫上發現小型民船兩艘，當時用信號囑其離開，最初該兩船置之不理，繼再拉一次信號後，始遵命駛開，而此時，爆炸卽發生矣。但該兩船究與爆炸有無關係，殊難解釋。至爆炸發生地點，據稱並非在鍋鑪　以內，故鍋鑪爆炸之說，並不可靠。又外傳輸上如奸徒置有定時炸彈，或謂船上乘有携帶軍火之某部士兵數十人，係軍火爆炸所致，然此均爲推測之詞，未足徵信。總之，失事原因尙須調查研究。</p>
<p>招商局前　一片哭聲</p>
<p>自該輪慘劇發生後，一般乘客家屬聞訊均驚　莫名，昨日赴招商局探問消息者達數百人，更有不少婦女在該局門口痛哭流涕，慘不忍睹。據該局負資人表示；善後問題，公司當局最近曾向保險公司保有旅客安全險。傷者之醫藥費將由公司負担。獲救乘客中如願繼續赴甬者，可免費乘明日該局江靜輪離滬，否則可退還船票費。該局對於今後航行安全問題自當更爲注意。此次損失總數，現尙無法佔計。</p>
<p>被難家屬　要求三點</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本報昨接一讀者名傳其釗者來函，謂其母亦乘該輪，直至昨晚存亡莫卜。並謂擬請招商局辦理下列諸事；（一）繼續設法營救，（二）趕速打撈屍體，（三）有爲過路船隻營救者，請速設法查究。</p>
<h3>滬甬綫航輪　改隔日一班</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局滬甬綫班輪，原係江亞江靜兩輪，除星期日休航外，每日下午四時半，上海寗波兩地對開，現因江亞輪失事後，祇一輪行駛，改爲隔日一班，每晨六時啓椗，故江　輪昨日未開，改今晨六時駛甬。</p>

<h3>房租漲率　令人咋舌　直接威脅平民生計　並將影響社會治安　房客總聯會今對策</h3>
<p>「八一九」財經緊急處分令頒佈時，全國各地房租標準，原定由中央統籌擬訂，公佈實施，嗣以限價政策修正，此項新標準，迄未公佈，而本市房租，前於本年六月間，雖經參議會轉請地政局執行，限定營業用屋按戰前九千倍，居住用屋按戰前七千倍計算，惟此項標準，照該會原決議案至本年九月底已失時效，十月以後，房租計算標準，無所依據，業主紛紛自動調整，租賃糾紛乃多如雨後春笋。地政局祝局長前曾公開表示，希望各項房租糾紛，由房東房客雙方協議，作合理調整，不料一部份房地產業主竟據以爲藉口，最近紛紛片面擅自增租，上海市房客總聯合會全體理監事認爲此種不法增租，不但直接威脅平民生計，並將影響整個社會治安，絕對不容忽視，頃已通知該會全體團體會員代表，並邀集本市新聞界人士，定今日下午三時假南京西路三五四號大觀社內，舉行房租問題座談會，討論解決房租問題之合理辦法，以便一致行動，籲請各界援助，反對不合理增租，以維平民生計，安定社會秩序。據悉：本市房地產業主此次增租所擬漲率之鉅，令人昨舌，且普遍及於中下等房屋，對平民生計，將有極嚴重之威脅。舉例如某房客代表稱，義品銀行經租之天潼路浙江北路茶里「八一九」改幣前月租每幢僅發幣一百五十餘萬元，最近突通知各房客，聲明自九月份起，調整爲每月一百九十餘金圓，計漲四百倍左右。</p>

<h3>人心堅·銀根鬆　食米昨反動激漲粉糧油餅普遍上升市氣俏利</h3>
<p>米市昨反動回漲，漲勢甚猛，因戶口米價與市價相仿，人心卽隨之轉堅，加之銀根續鬆，產地報漲，米店因門銷活潑，納　轉强，開市卽見俏利異常。南市塲漲勢尤猛，初開會喊高一百元，收市稍軟，終見軋升七八十元。白粳及薄稻各出四百元外，爲四百二十元。北市塲漲勢略遜南市，白粳薄稻各開四百元，計挺五十元。秈米漲三四十元，二市塲到貨共計八千七百八十七石。</p>

<h3>茶市疲莫能興</h3>
<p>茶市疲風，繼續蔓延，揆其原因，自貨方需款殷切，對於紅綠茶願貶價求售以來，買方一味猛斬，是以市氣趨虛，價格方面，一路下瀉，交易則仍屬狹隘，由於一般目光咸抱看低，故買氣尙未展開云。</p>

<p>昨日棉布市勢，因粵漢兩帮仍在搜購南運，市上買氣仍濃，執貨者扳價，十二磅龍頭細布，初喊平庸，嗣因本客買戶活躍，一度喊高至四百元。迨至收時，以紡建開配，某染廠因色布各地實銷不動，反將龍頭白坯吐售，賣風一開，價乃回低至三百九十元結束，較上日步漲二十元。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰，因漢口帮再度搜求，上揚至四百元，軋升廿五元。其餘各布，以川粵漢等帮俱有採辦，價均堅秀。</p>

<h3>機械下鄉　江西農墾業務向前推進</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌二日快訊〕江西是塊鄱陽平原，素有「江南穀倉」之稱，但是近十餘年來，連遭匪禍寇災，曩昔繁盛而耕作不息的農地，現在却呈現着一片荒蕪。據農林處的初步調查，正待開墾的熟荒，在二十萬畝以上，幾佔全省可耕面積的三分之一。省政當局雖亦不斷在扶植春耕，獎勵冬作，奈因人力，肥料以及農村經濟的不景氣，連年開荒增產的數字，實在寥寥。</p>
<p>機械農墾正是給江西的荒蕪農村一支生力軍，他們用很少的人力，獲得更多的收穫，是曳引着破落的農村，走上復興增產的大道。現在江西機械農墾處，普遍展開農墾示範工作及代耕工作。</p>
<p>現階段的中國農村，完全用人力，畜力去耕紜，農墾處爲了推行機械墾殖，使古老式的農民，能够由人力畜力的運用推進到機械的運用，所以採取據點式的舉辦南昌·德安·瑞昌·上高</p>
<p>示範農場</p>
<p>他們利用遍野的荒地，用機械去耕紜，使當地的老百姓認識機械的效能，進而利用代耕辦法，從事於自己的耕紜。</p>
<p>上高泗溪農塲，是江西機械耕極最早的所在，於三十六年十月就着手進行。德安·南昌·瑞昌等塲，及全省十六縣市機械農墾業務，乃於去年底陸續由機墾處次第舉辦，現在他們示範農塲墾荒的面積，已達四千畝，連同過去的義務代墾及鄧家埠浙贛鐵路的合辦農場，已墾的荒地而積約在十萬畝左右。惟今年春夏時節　雨，影響耕作，卽己種下或經生長之農作物，亦多被水所浸，或遭冲刷，所以今夏的收成，據　墾處的估計，損失芝蔴二〇〇　，瓜子七〇石，棉花二〇担，高粱四〇石，共被淹沒作物面積達四三四畝，生產價値損失八千四百餘元。　現在，示範農場的工作人員，又全面展開了</p>
<p>冬作運動</p>
<p>他們在這種新的事業上，不避艱難，亦不怕辛苦，大家對　着事業成功的總目標邁進，今　種植了三千畝小麥，三百畝油　，四百畝蠶豆，預期在明年上　可以收穫小麥四千五百石，油采二百石，蠶豆二百石，生產收益，照現在市價估計，可達五萬五千元，明年的夏季生產量，當亦在五萬元以上。</p>
<p>代耕，抽水工作，在南昌，德安，瑞昌，都組設了工作站，由各該處的示範農場，兼顧辦理，由於他們收費低廉，附近老百姓，都知道利用機械代耕，如開荒，播種，收割，以至抽水，有許多地方的旱田，原來都沒打算去耕紜，因爲得到機墾處抽水站的帮助，今年倒比水田的收穫高出一二倍，老百姓心目中認爲這是意外的收割，更引起他們使用新機械的興趣，所以現在要求</p>
<p>代耕抽水的紛至沓來，機墾處統計，今年上期代耕的面積有二〇七五·六畝，代耙八·二九畝，排水五四六五小時，灌水一四三七·九畝。</p>
<p>現在機墾處，更擬進一步由示範墾殖而推廣到「機械下鄉」，使各地的農民，都能利用新的機械耕種，所以在他們「示範」，「代耕」業務之外，並推進到配售農業機械。據林逢春處長談：此項業務—配售農業機械，在江西，自使用曳引機及抽水機以來，巳起示範效能，引起一般農民的注意，一部份農民，並欲購買機械，但</p>
<p>配售工作仍少有成績。其原因在：（一）農村經濟凋敝，（二）農足缺乏組織，多屬小農經營，以現存農田制度，使用農業機械，受地形及經營制度之限制。</p>
<p>所以，機墾處現在對於改進農村機械種作的辦法，一方面擴展已辦的示範農場，同時並實施分期付款辦法，使經濟凋敝的農民，得有機會購備農業機械，更接受農民的申請畀予學習機械耕作的機會。</p>
<p>機械農墾在江西，雖然不及一年的歷史，但是在他們慘淡經營下，已收相當成效。我們看中國農業機械化的「萌芽」雜誌上的記載與機械農墾管理處前次派員來贛考察的報告，他們都認爲江西處的業務，如示範農塲，代耕，供應，加工等工作，都認眞的做到好處，就是一個明證。</p>
<h3>瀋陽解體前後　虎口餘生　目擊慘狀　提供嚴重教訓　（下）</h3>
<p>廿九日，瀋陽的東郊和北郊，都有了綿密的槍砲聲。卅日晨間，纔稍靜止下來。靜止的原因，是前棧已經右了文章，那就是設已開始進行。廿九日和卅日午，衛立煌召東北政務委員會高惜氷，彭濟羣，王家楨，遼　省主席王鐵漢，瀋陽市長董文琦等開會，由參謀長趙家驤報告當前情况，同時守軍不穩的消息，不斷的傳進了這個圓桌會議，僉認大勢巳去，幾個文職官員，至此纔明白了危急情况的全貌。</p>
<p>初，總統尙電令瀋陽死守，衛等開會時，始復得總統電令，命率文武高級官員卽時撤退。下午三時衛僅偕趙家驤，高惜氷，王家楨，王鐵漢，董文琦，彭濟羣等幾個人，和以後趕來的新一軍軍長潘裕昆，新三軍畏龍天武，瀋空軍副司令吳禮，此外還有以後趕來的騎兵司令兼遼北省主席徐梁，瀋陽警備司令胡家驥等人。</p>
<p>登機的一剎那，情景太堅張，太悽慘，因為有好多從前綫退下來的官兵，擁在飛機前，搶着登飛機，前排後擁，一片紊亂。衛立煌爬上飛機了，趙家驤也上飛機了，王家楨被人從人頭頂上傳進去了，董文琦被人拉着從旁邊上去了，其餘像王鐵漢等也都上去了，外交部東北特派員張劍非等拉着董市長的手得以登堂入室，彭委員濟羣被擠於機外，始終上不去。該機凌空起飛時，地下是一片</p>
<p>叫囂喊嗎這是東陵最後起飛的一架飛機。</p>
<p>渾河機塲呢？卅日下午停着四架飛機·說是負有特殊任務·塲外原有前兩天　票而未得飛走的公務人員，接着是一批一批跑得滿頭大汗趕來的軍事人員，數目約有一百人。</p>
<p>那四架飛機，不久，都以「試飛」為名·發動引擎，一架一架的空着飛跑了，當時機塲裏的人，失望，痛憤，又有誰來理會！</p>
<p>記者目睹中央然部婦女會東北區幹事　綸女士，拉住了空軍某副司令的吉甫車，痛哭失聲，指着站在旁邊的一個靑年說：「我做姨母的，要不把鄭洞國的少爺帶走，實在對不起人，你們都要走了，千萬給我想想辦法！」得到的回答是：「現在情况己好轉，我們若走了，對不起國家。」說完吉甫一溜烟，跑到了東塔機塲，聽說和衛立煌一塊兒飛走了</p>
<p>朱綸女士留在機塲走不了，一位嘴嚼口香糖，要求搭機的太太，連說：「我是陳副總司令夫人，」所得到的也是愛莫能助。當記者於傍晚離開飛機塲時，還看見一批一批的軍事工作人員，奔向飛機塲，幻想脫離險地，結果都落得一塲空。</p>
<p>卅日，午後和晚間，瀋陽周圍，異樣沉寂，原國防部軍法監東北區主任趙毅（希堅），及不得已以地方人士身份出頭的王化一（在東塔排班沒能禁登飛機），商會負責人盧迺賡，新一軍許養揚等，激於氣憤，感到失望，在一家店舖內，和共方接談，聞談判內容主旨在免瀋陽市民於塗炭，要求「八路」暫緩開入，萬勿以瀋陽作戰塲一。</p>
<p>卅一日，市郊無大變化，街頭也極靜謐，只有來往搬家的軍人和市民，稍現紛亂，這似在吿訴人們，局勢將有急變，夜間，星光滿天，大地一片沉寂。</p>
<p>十一月一日，拂曉前，鐵西區響起了轟然爆炸聲，接着是不斷的砲彈聲，槍子聲，市民驚起，以爲「和談」決裂，後來才知道是一個火藥庫爆炸了。</p>
<p>上午，飛機絕跡於天空，市內到處響着雜亂的槍聲，上衣袋口綴着紅綢條的軍人出現街頭，從事警戒，好多的解體的官兵，手提背負着衣物，餅乾，麵粉，到處亂竄。</p>
<p>中午，槍聲稀了，衣冠破舊的零星匪軍，腰揷手溜彈，扛着大鐵棍，出現於市區。解體的國軍，東一堆，西一堆的，在看着這些疲憊的匪軍。後來有成隊的匪軍來了，帽子上帶着草圈，揷着亂草。不久，吉普車，大卡車，在街頭飛駛了，到處搜繳槍械，武器。接着，</p>
<p>韓共來了，也開進了市區，搜繳武器，從事警衛，變方「和談」至此也無結果的散了，趙毅等卅日午後去鐵嶺和匪接談，但未得回來，五十三軍軍長周福或，東北剿總總參議蘇炳文等，還有其他人員巳被軟禁。在這中間，二〇七師一部官兵曾作反抗和突圍的衝殺，惜已難成事。</p>
<p>傍晚，空軍從北平飛臨瀋陽，投下了第一炸彈。夜間。每隔三四十分，就有飛機飛臨轟炸，照明彈亮徹市空，繼續了一個整夜，轟炸地域廣泛。</p>
<p>二日，一部貧民分了幾家糧區的存糧，拆毀幾處房屋。下午，空軍又來炸鐵西工廠，東關兵工廠，三日，四日，又繼續炸了兩天。夜間，有時也飛臨，有幾所火藥庫被炸中，不斷的響着爆炸聲，大概是七日，匪方運到了高射砲，開始對空射擊，但轟炸未停。</p>
<p>匪於三日成立「軍事管制委員會」中陳雲，伍修權，陶鑄，張學思，王首道，陳部，朱其文，陳龍等八人爲委員，陳雲任主委，伍，陶，副之，內設財政，經濟，後勤，鐵路四處。</p>
<p>瀋陽市警備司令部改爲「衛戍司令部」，由伍修權，陶籌分任正副司令，匪遼寗省主席張學思於五日抵瀋就職，瀋陽僞市長是朱其文，為副市長焦若愚，僞財政局長賈石，偽工業局長劉向三，僞商業局長朱竟之，僞社會局長甘重斗，偽總務局長王石靑，僞衛生局長江峯，僞敎育局長邵凱，偽公安局長何俠：僞人民發院院長章雲龍等，都分別就了僞職。</p>
<p>匪此次進佔瀋陽市，大感措手不及，故其政治人員，遲於部隊五六日後始到達。十一月十日正式展開活動，市內各區政府，十日成立，十五日開始</p>
<p>調查戶口，每日召集市民開會，市民不勝其煩。</p>
<p>不勝其煩。</p>
<p>經濟上措施，老百姓損失最大，先規定金圓劵和流通券一律停止使用，後來又應請求規定比値兌換十天。</p>
<p>起初，大家賣東西，換錢，買東西，開原和四平的運糧大車來了，高梁米的確下落了，可是別的貨色和日用品來源沒了，一致上揚，所以生活更艱苦。</p>
<p>共黨「貿易局」在吸收衣服，日用品，老百姓拿東西去換糧食和豆油，「貿易局」大找便宜，「貿易局」分佈在各區，做着所有能做的營業，採購，運輸，各地都有龐大機構，各大商店將被排擠，大的企業和商業，將被「貿易局」獨佔。</p>
<p>有車馬的人，多組織「生產車」，拉坐，運貨，受保護，吃公糧，所得利益對分，匪原無火車，汽車運輸，得生產車帮助頗大。現交通情勢雖已大變，但這樣的生產膠輪大車，仍多奔馳各公路棧上。</p>
<p>東北事，搞的這樣糟，損失的那樣的慘，大家都有責任，尤共是從接收起到這次慘敗止，應該算算舊賬，應該弄個靑紅皂白，這是一塲大濟算，這是一個大敎訓，諱疾忌醫，試問還有出路嗎？</p>

<h3>共產主義在中國　（五）</h3>
<p>在日本投降以後不久開始的國共對東北的競爭，到了後來纔演變而爲公開的內戰。一九四六年下半年，共產黨對於自己的實力漸漸有了自信，同時相更信美國將停止支持國民黨，至少是暫時的。在共產區域裏，共黨宣傳的基本態度自始就有着强烈的反美傾向。在一九四六年六月二十日那天，這種宣傳方針更擴展到了非共產區域裏去。這一天可以有做第二次內戰由東北基延到中國本部的一天。那天上海方面的蘇聯電台和中文報紙展開了反美宣傳運動。這事緊接在共黨在山東方面發動軍事攻勢之後，國共雙方素來合作的執行總部當局初次在東北以外的中國部份發生了公開的裂痕。接着是毛澤東公然要求美國停止一切對國民政府的援助，並撤退駐華軍隊。</p>
<p>在上海報紙的宣傳運動開始以後，六月二十三日，亦卽毛澤東發表聲明的那天，接着又發生了遊行和示威運動，參加的人數估計在五萬至十萬之間。這次騷動演變成爲「美軍退出中國週」的運動，時在六月最後一個星期</p>
<p>這時的宣傳方針，目的在强調共產黨諭望和平，而美國則否，馬撳爾的努力被置諸腦後。宣傳者謂美軍駐在中國的任務如遣送日軍回國等，早巳完成，沒有再留駐中國的必要。</p>
<p>宣傳者且更進一層斥責美國是亞洲的侵略國，日本帝國主義的後繼者；籲請政府軍隊以昔日對日抗戰的精神一致反抗美國。民間的宣傳謂美國帝國主義比較日本帝國主義更精明，更正式，因爲美國較日本爲强大，所以美國帝國主義愈加危險可怕。</p>
<p>共產黨的宣傳不外是一大套陳腐的反美論調：美國出售賸餘物資被稱爲帝國主義的；美國的進口貨被認爲和土產品競賣；美國商談民用航空協定的事，被認爲控制空中運輸權的先聲；美國人汽車肇禍表示美國軍人的漫不經心，肇禍以後不依法起訴，表示國民政府對外人的奴性。當然，凡是可以借題發揮的美國新聞都加以鋪張渲染，包括美國罷工的報導和謠言，不愜於國民政府的美國政界人物的言論。黑人的私刑訊問在目前雖已大部廢止，仍被强調宣傳。國民政府佔領的區域裏的報紙也抓住了共產黨的反美宣傳的大題目而大事宣傳，「自由派」的報紙所刋登的漫畫把「山姆叔叔」描寫成傀儡戲的紊綫人，或則趁火打刦，或則在中國市塲囤積居奇，或則憑藉商約謀取帝國主義的利益。</p>
<p>這是共產黨對中國宣傳的眞面目，它的任務並不是要使民衆皈依共產主義—那是紅軍的任務。宣傳的目的祗在淆惑人心和削弱非共產區域內民衆的意志和信心。</p>
<p>至於把非共產區域的任何部份改變爲共產區域的一部份，那是一種軍事的工作，而以經濟戰和政治戰的技術爲支援的。有人稱道種戰術爲社會學的戰術，因爲它把經濟學，心理學，政治，財政等等因素冶於一　。</p>
<p>共產黨進佔一個地區以後，照例設立一個臨時的軍事機關，動員當地的賤民搶刦已經逃避的居民和富有者的住屋。他們又設立一所「人民法院」，預備審訊圖搗亂的任何人。他們實行拉伕。他們發行新的貨幣，收回國民政府發行的貨幣，利用兌換率來毀滅人民的積蓄，消除貧富貴賤的階級。</p>
<p>昔日反對日本支持中國傀儡政府和軍閥的宣傳方式，現在又被用來對付美國的支持國民政府，而這個政府變成了美國的傀儡</p>
<p>宣傳的另一方面表明中國人民是愛好和平的，中共也是愛好和平的。假如沒有美國的陰謀支持它的傀儡蔣介石，決不會有內戰發生，凡是愛好和平的中國人應一致起來支持愛好和平的中國共產黨。</p>
<p>中國人民沒有忘掉國民政府對日抗戰的功績，對於國民政府的態度原不致突然改變，可是爲了對美國的譴責而减少了他們的信念。當時蔣氏所受到的攻擊祇是：美國政策的傀儡和受騙者。中國民衆心裏很明白：破壞停戰協定和再度發動內戰的是共產黨而不是國民政府。把內戰的發動歸咎於美國的陰謀，於是認爲共產黨不是眞正的戰爭發動者似乎不無理由的了。</p>
<p>由於許多中國人已經和美國人有了若干接觸，同時多數美國人已經有了好的印象這個事實，共產主義的宣傳家並沒有遭遇到多大困難。他們把美國人分爲兩大類，一類是有好感的國人和美國的左派人士，一類是其他一切人士。這第二類美國人都被列爲法西斯帝國主義者。</p>
<p>人民法院隨當地的情形而不向，但大概是沒有法律條例或證據的，而以暴民政治加以任何罪名，並任意宣判，共產黨對外籍基督敎敎士的審判和宣判死刑的事實，證明了共產黨對於宗敎的蔑視。</p>
<p>在一九四五年和一九四六年間，曾先後發生共產黨干涉敎會活動的事件，包括刦掠·罰鍰·槍擊·當衆行刑。以及逮捕·失踪等情。聯總服務人員常被攔阻，狙擊或派警監護。同時共產黨的宣傳要求聯總增强對共區的援助，聯總的藥品源源運往共產黨的軍事醫院。</p>
<p>這一切策略把經濟體系破壞無遺。但這不致妨碍共產主義，因爲共產黨無須給養它沒有佔領的城市，也無須到界外的「敵人」區域中去找尋市塲。可是它的確處處削弱國民政府的力量。共產黨在奪得全部政權以前，情願使國家趨於崩潰，而且有種種方法促成這種局面。在其控制還沒有穩定的任何區域裏，共產黨決無從事經濟建設的動機。</p>
<p>共產主義的軍事方而勝過共產黨組織的其他因素，這可從其他方面和中國以外的地方見到。中國紅軍的正規軍隊給予觀察者以最好的印象。在迅速成長的最近數年中，它的紀律和士氣已較前衰落，但是紅軍在新近克復地區的施政，大概比較後來的民政設施爲優良。它的高級官員大都是幹練而富有多年的遊擊戰經騐。它的低級官員則絞庸劣，士兵大都是普通的徵兵，和中國過去任何軍隊的士兵沒有什麽分別。它的避免作戰的政策實在最配只圖行刧的不發份子的胃口。</p>
<p>中共的組織强調了內戰活動的情景。中共的最高統治機關是中央執行委員會，由委員四十四人，候補委員三十三人組成。執行委員中有十二人爲軍人，候補委員中至少有五人爲軍人。中央執行委員會通常由兩個較小的團體—政治局和軍事委員會—執行黨務。政治局由八人組成，是中共的眞正的執行委員會，軍事委員會由委員六人組成。有四人兼任兩團體的委員，毛澤東兼任局會主席·因此共產政府最高機關的基本分野是介乎軍事與民事之間，兩者密切合作，祇是文官的職權略爲高些。</p>
<p>共產黨中央政府的行政部門直轄於中央執行委員會，分司宣傳·敎育·經濟·財政等職掌·中共的行政，地方分權的成分多於中央集權，在下級行政機關，軍事與民政事權的劃分異常平均，差不多完全視個別的情形而定。一個軍隊的司令官可以做一地方的長官，一個政治委員也可能是另一地方的長官，全視他們的魄力·野心和個人的才幹而定。</p>
<p>爲概括說明日軍投降以後中國共產黨的作爲，我們不妨再引述一下美國主持下的和談時期的情形。中共破壞一月十日的停戰協定，於春初開始向東北進軍，七月間又向山東方面推進。他們圍困河北永年達一年之久。在這年年底共軍司令朱德誇張他們已經殲滅國民黨軍隊四十五個旅。國民政府的報道則謂停戰開始時共軍祇控制着六十縣，到停戰結東時已擴大到三百縣，在此時期內據說雙方不斷舉行正式的談判，以期成立停戰協定，電取全面的解決。</p>
<p>丙　世界共產主義變換方針</p>
<p>從對德和對日戰爭結束時起，世界共產主義已開始改變方針。這是和列寗派學說吻合的又一次共黨政策的大轉變，自從一九二一年由戰時共產主義政策轉變到所謂新經濟政策的第一次大轉變以來，這是第六次轉變。顯然的，我們對於這世界共產主義戰略的轉變，不得不加以考慮一下</p>
<p>毛澤東在他的著作裏面認爲中國的局勢在多方面須視世界大局而定。蘇俄革命以後中國局勢的發展不會利以前相同。一九三〇年及戰爭期間，中國的政治問題是和歐洲及世界其他部份的局勢互相呼應的。這不僅是毛澤東的見解，同時也是一般共產黨的標準的觀念。</p>
<p>於是我們不妨假定：過去三年中世界局勢的大變動一定反映於中國共產主義的轉變方針，雖則那新方針還沒有十分明朗化。被適用到中國的「新民主」政策畢竟和戰時盟國的合作同一時期，而且也是一九三六年在歐洲發軔的「人民陣綫」主義的引伸。「新民主主義」曾於一九四五年和一九四六年間被東歐若干國家所採行，它們設立政府，允許共黨在內閣中佔據重要地位，並利用這些政府來保持他不可動搖的優勢。這樣，「新民主主義」的未來目標立刻變成了當前的事實，取消了民主作風和各黨調和的一切口實，把怎樣奪取政權的問題一變而爲奪得政權以後怎樣利用的問題。這個變動，簡單地說起來也就是共產黨在若干國家的得勢，變成了由戰時的共產主義與民主國家的妥協合作，過渡到「冷戰」的世界潮流的一個重要時點。</p>
<p>共產黨奪得政權以後的基本的活動方式，在蘇聯本身的歷史裏表現得最明白。共產黨在一個工業落後國家得勢以後所遇到的大問題有如下列數項：</p>
<p>一，爲日後國際鬥爭而擴大戰爭潛勢力所必需的工業發展的速度。</p>
<p>二，此種工業發展所必需的資本積累的速度。</p>
<p>三，爲擴充工業勞力而减少農業勞力所必需的農業集體化的速度。</p>
<p>四，確定從聯合陣綫的分權轉變到共產黨專權的最適當的時機。</p>
<p>五，確定共產主義由過度强調愛國情緒逐漸减退的最適當的時機。</p>
<p>六，確定共產黨實行淸黨，和恢復堅强陣綫的黨派以代替「新民主主義」的散漫的黨派的最適當時機。</p>
<p>七，共產黨以外各階級和各黨派的分化。</p>
<p>八，確定新共產區併入蘇聯版圖的最適當的時機·</p>
<p>過去三年中的共產主義問題，可說是爲應付上述諸問題的共產主義的再出發‘但是卽使把這此問題作爲當務之急去應付，也不能再應用「新民主主義」的策略。因此這共產主義的再出發需要改變組織，重行調整其他團體的聯通緊，更易若干共產黨的領袖，和改變方針和策略。</p>
<p>自從試組容納共產黨的聯合內開的努力失敗以後，「新民主主義」適用於中國的機會卽吿終止。但是中國共產黨能够忍受這個變化。自一九四四年以後，中共的實力巳日漸强大。它採取一種新方針，並沒有遭遇任何嚴重的問題，因爲中國內戰方興未艾，還沒有達到決定的階段。中共在中國內戰中如果獲勝，必將引起在東歐方面成爲最嚴重的共黨內部政策問題，以及有關中國促進亞洲方面共產主義所負使命的問題。但是中共臨到這些問題時必能設法應付。</p>
<p>丁　美國對中國問題的論戰</p>
<p>對於美國，中國問題是一個援助問題。自日本投降以來，美國方面對此問題曾作廣泛的討論。問題當然是難於解決的，單看辯論的曠日持久，不能得到一個滿意的結論，就可以推想這問題的棘手了。外交委員會於本年二三月間開會討論一九四八年援外法案時，贊成者和反對者所持理由曾有詳盡的指出，茲歸納如左</p>
<p>主張在中國沒有奠定國內團結和平的基礎以前，美國不應援助中國者，所特的理由如左：</p>
<p>一，如果和平可能實現，一定也可能避免國際戰爭和大規模的內戰。</p>
<p>二，如果和平可能實現，在中國一定也能聯合各黨各派共同合作以奠定民主的共和國之基礎。</p>
<p>三，美國對中國有什麽援助，蘇聯亦必有相對的行動，雙方進入競爭性的干涉。</p>
<p>四，局外的國家不應干涉中國的內戰。</p>
<p>五，如果局外的國家干涉內戰，卽是侵犯了人民自決的權利。</p>
<p>六，國民政府組織旣不健全，而又腐化，美國如果給它援助，這援助一定被浪費掉。</p>
<p>七，過去數年中，美國和聯合國善後救濟總署曾給予中國不少援助，並沒有發生甚麽效果。</p>
<p>八，如果我們給予中國充分的援助，終於會使中國成爲我們的大得難以處理的永久負累。</p>
<p>九，中國共產主義是一種經濟改革運動，健全而有力的。</p>
<p>十，「新民主主義」是一種自由主義的，民主的方案。</p>
<p>十一，關於中國獨立對美國安全的重要性之類的問題，一定不被列入聯合國的世界和平計劃中。</p>
<p>十二，中國地域過大，援助難期有效。</p>
<p>十三，欲長期保持中國人民的好感，祗有採取不千涉政策。我們如果千涉中國的事情，卽使不必負內戰的責任，在中國人心目中也得負戰事延長的責任。</p>
<p>至於贊成美國援助中國的人，則持如下的理市：</p>
<p>一，共產主義不單是經濟改革，而且是專門技術水凖空　前高的權力政治。</p>
<p>二·如果一方面不千涉一國的內戰而另一方面干涉內戰，仍不能保全該國的自決權。</p>
<p>三，蘇聯巧妙地而且大規模地干涉中國內戰。</p>
<p>四，中國曾受二十餘年內戰和國際戰爭的苦難，國民政府背後的中國的組織是旣脆弱而又腐敗的。　（未完）</p>

<h3>The Battle Situation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is Daily Expanding; Northern and Southern National Armies are About to Join Forces; A Major Victory Against the Main Force of the Liu Bandit on the South Bank of the Hui River</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 4th] The battle situation in the area has shown signs of expanding. After the Huang Wei Corps crossed the North Fei River to attack, they are still engaged in fierce battles with the bandits on the south bank of the Hui River, more than 40 li south of Su County. The southward corps has now crossed Jiagou and is approaching Fuliji, and its western flank has also attacked Qiaoxikou. The Li and Liu corps on the Bengbu front have continued to make progress in the area north of Caolaoji today. According to air force reconnaissance reports, the individual distances of the three major armies are all about 80 li. Military sources informed today that if the battle situation in the area develops according to the predetermined steps, the Sun and Huang corps will be able to join forces no later than the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in the Bengbu Front, 4th] The battle situation in the area today is as follows: The Liu Corps on the right flank of the National Army advanced to Yuanzhaiji on the south bank of the Jie River. A certain unit of the Li Corps on the front annihilated a reconnaissance battalion of the 6th Column of the bandits near Renheji, and the gains were also significant. A regiment of the 18th Division of that column stubbornly resisted at Lao Caolaoji (about 7 li northwest of Caolaoji Station) and is also being closely besieged and annihilated by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 4th] It is reported that the Huang Wei Corps previously launched a full-scale attack on the main force of the Liu Bandit, which had invaded a position on the south bank of the Hui River with a longitudinal extension of only 4 kilometers. The situation has now turned favorable. The unit is annihilating an average of more than 3,000 bandits per day, and more than 30,000 bandits have been routed in recent days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Military news: In the area west of Hongze Lake in northern Anhui, in the Fei River and Hui River basin, the National Army's annihilation battle with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway as the main axis has become increasingly advantageous. The Huang Wei Corps of the National Army in the Shuangyuji area northwest of Bengbu, with superior firepower, inflicted heavy losses on the main force of the Liu Bocheng bandit group, resulting in fierce battles for over ten days, killing and wounding over 20,000 bandits. Currently, the Huang Wei Corps, alongside the Liu Ruming and Li Yannian corps advancing north from Yuexiang, are relentlessly pursuing the Chen and Liu bandit groups fleeing north from Yue Guzhen. The Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang corps of the National Army, under the command of Du Yuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Xuzhou, withdrew from Xuzhou on the morning of the 3rd and crossed the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Jiagou with overwhelming superiority. In the Wuliuji and Sunzhuang area (both more than 80 li north of Su County), they defeated the Chen Yi's 3rd, 10th, and 16th Columns of the bandits. The remaining bandits, unable to resist, fled towards eastern Henan. The Chen Yi bandit group's Rapid, 13th, 11th, and 3rd Columns are still stubbornly resisting at Fuliji on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The National Army continues to launch a joint north-south attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 4th] The National Army in northern Huai has made further progress today. The front and both flanks have advanced close to Guzhen by varying distances of five to ten kilometers, and another battalion of the rearguard of the Chen Bandit's 6th Column has been annihilated. Liu Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters here, told reporters: For more than ten days, the National Army units have used the "strategy of eating the small with the big," consuming at least one regiment of the Chen and Liu bandit forces every day. This inevitable trend of accumulating small victories into a major victory will lead the Chen and Liu bandits to collapse silently.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Military news: On the 4th, the weather was clear, and our air force was dispatched all day to assist ground troops in fiercely bombing the remnants of the bandits who fled from Guzhen on the north bank of the Hui River. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, and small groups of three to five hundred men fled in groups to the northwest.</p>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco Broadcasting: The Chinese Ministry of National Defense recently issued a public statement, stating briefly: The communist bandits in the Huai River area are currently being pressured by the National Army from the north and south and have retreated to the eastern plains of Henan Province. According to official sources, the National Army has reinforced the Central China battlefield with 100,000 troops in order to defend Bengbu and protect the capital. The statement also stated: The ten columns of the Communist Army under Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng are moving from the Huai River towards Linhuanji, Yongcheng, Xiaoxian, and other places in the northwest. The war has also moved to that area. The purpose of the Communist Army's movement is obviously to reorganize the remnants and regroup. In the battles near Su County over the past ten days, the Communist Army suffered approximately 20,000 casualties, while the National Army suffered approximately 7,000 casualties. The statement also acknowledged that Xuzhou was voluntarily evacuated on Friday.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army's Current Actions: Containment is More Important than Attack; Tianjin-Pukou Railway Repair Advances with the Army</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 4th] According to the latest deployment decided by the military, the battle situation at Zhusu is about to develop. In this battlefield, the main force of the bandits is the seven columns of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's forces, and the relatively complete 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th columns of Chen Yi's forces. All of the above bandits were not seriously hit in the Xuzhou Campaign. The military believes that one of the reasons why the bandits are still stubbornly resisting here is to contain the National Army so that it cannot start chasing and suppressing immediately after the end of the Xuzhou Campaign, so that Chen Yi's broken troops have the opportunity to rest and reorganize. Therefore, the current action of the bandits is more about containment than attack.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 4th] People in the capital expressed optimism today about the war in East China, saying that if the National Army advancing south from Xuzhou engages in a major battle with the Communist Army and wins, the battle situation can be stabilized for at least two or three months. Chen Yi's troops were frustrated in their attack east of Xuzhou earlier this month. If they fail again this time, they will be unable to recover. At that time, approximately 35,000 new troops from the National Army in Central China have arrived in the Nanjing area to reinforce it, and 40,000 elite troops were already stationed along the Yangtze River, guarding the natural barrier.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Government officials said on the 4th that 150,000 National Army troops in Central China have been transferred to the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to participate in the war north of Bengbu. It is generally believed that the Communist Army is currently redeploying around Xuzhou in an attempt to launch another offensive. Currently, both the National Army and the Communist Army are deploying reinforcement troops to Bengbu and Su County to prepare for a decisive battle. According to semi-official sources, General Song Xilian, a famous anti-Japanese general in the Songhu battle, has arrived in Bengbu to command four armies, with an estimated strength of about 100,000 men, to guard the important town. The three armies advancing south from Xuzhou have as many as 180,000 men and are advancing towards Su County. The Communist Army between Bengbu and Guzhen has been cleared.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 4th] The Communist Army on the Hui River front is retreating north today to cope with the pressure from the southward corps from Xuzhou. The southward corps, totaling about 250,000 men, has advanced about 40 miles, encountering only weak resistance from the Communist Army. They can join forces with the northward army after advancing another 30 miles to the southwest.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Mingguang, 4th] When the Communist Army was being suppressed by the powerful troops of the National Army, they fled to Wujiawei, 60 li southwest of Dingyuan County, for reorganization. Currently, there is no trace of bandits in the Chibei River and Daishanpu area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Tianjin-Pukou Railway repair team, with the smooth progress of the northward National Army, went north from Bengbu on the 4th, along with the repairs. The railway bureau's transportation vehicles are now open to Caolaoji on the banks of the Fei River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 4th] Our air force distributed 350,000 copies of return certificates and leaflets to the Communist Army, advising the blindly following Communist masses to surrender as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin Has Not Been Evacuated; All Parts of Northern Jiangsu are Peaceful</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 4th] The military here officially denied the rumor that Huaiyin had been voluntarily evacuated. The military headquarters of a certain army is still stationed in Huaiyin, and military communications are still open. However, many civil service organs and military dependents have moved to Yangzhou, and the various rumors circulating are obviously due to this. Refugees traveling south along the Grand Canal have been arriving in an endless stream in recent days, and the stations and ports are extremely crowded. The city defense department has advanced the curfew to 9:00 PM every night, but the people of Yangzhou are extremely calm.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 4th] It is confirmed that all parts of northern Jiangsu have been as peaceful as ever recently, and there have been no wars. Both Huai and Yi are becoming more stable, and the various rumors circulating are not to be believed.</p>
<h3>Unnecessary Ports on the Yangtze River are Strictly Prohibited from Passage</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jiangyin, 4th] The Second Fleet of the Navy has strictly prohibited passage to unnecessary ports, bays, river crossings, and ferry crossings along the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. It has also telegraphed the counties along the river to report the names, navigation and berthing times, and types of all ships that need to navigate and berth in the ports, bays, river crossings, and ferry crossings, and to discuss them with the relevant trade associations, and to reply in detail ten days in advance for public announcement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Naval Headquarters is aware that the Yangtze River defense deployment has long been completed, and a large number of powerful naval vessels have been mobilized to strengthen the patrolling of the Yangtze River to prevent the remnants of the bandits from harassing. Last week, a New 1st Brigade, 13th Regiment of the Communist Army, with more than 400 men in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, briefly harassed Banyueshan near Shashi and continued to attack Jiangkou (upstream of Shashi). They were intercepted bravely by our garrison naval vessels, and the bandits suffered more than 100 casualties and fled in panic. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, small groups of bandits took advantage of the gap to harass Tianxing. The naval vessels and self-defense forces launched a fierce attack, capturing many. The Communist Youyou Regiment of about 500 men near Shagou, Gaoyou, in northern Jiangsu launched a siege on our Shibu self-defense force at dawn on the 29th. They once advanced to the core position of Shibu Town Street and fought fiercely with our self-defense force. The invading bandits were finally annihilated by more than half under the overwhelming firepower of the Navy. The remaining bandits retreated and Shibu was immediately recovered.</p>
<h3>The Capital's Morning Curfew is Lifted Early</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] During the curfew period in the capital, which was originally scheduled from 11:00 PM every night to 6:00 AM the next morning, the Garrison Headquarters has specially shortened the curfew time by one hour for the convenience of citizens' transportation. It will still begin at 11:00 PM in the evening, but will be lifted earlier at 5:00 AM in the morning, starting from May 5th.</p>
<h3>Wuhan to Implement Curfew Starting on the 8th</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 4th] The curfew time during the winter defense period here is stipulated to be implemented from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM the next morning, starting on the 8th.</p>
<h3>A Security Captain in Inner Mongolia Unwilling to Cooperate with the Communist Army</h3>
<p>Leading Cavalry to Break Through the Siege</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 3rd] Zhengzhong News Agency reports: A telegram from the Zhaowuda League of Inner Mongolia: Tala Ba, the Chief of the Zhasake Nong Security Brigade of the Lukeerfen Banner, unwilling to cooperate due to the occupation of the banner by Communist bandits, led more than 2,000 cavalrymen to break through the siege, and a group of refugees followed. They will arrive in Ping soon. The Ping Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to prepare to accommodate this batch of refugees.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Annihilate Invading Bandits Outside Zhangjiakou; War Enters the Pursuit Phase; Two Regiments and One Brigade of the Communist Army Annihilated</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 4th] After the complete defeat of the bandits in Wanquan, they again used the 1st Column to launch a fierce attack on the southeast of Zhangjiakou. The National Army sent troops to meet them, surrounding two regiments of bandits in Yaojiafang (15 li southeast of Zhangjiakou) and one brigade of bandits in Shalingzi. They were completely annihilated from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. In addition, reinforcement troops of the National Army in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway have arrived in Xuanhua.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 4th] The battle outside Zhangjiakou has entered the pursuit phase after the invading bandits were severely annihilated by our army in recent days. After the invading bandits southeast of Zhangjiakou were hit hard on the 3rd, the main force of the 1st Column fled to the mountains south of the Yanghe River. The remnants of the bandits in the area north of the Yanghe River fled in separate groups. The National Army's eastward advancing troops, under the cover of our Shenying team, continued to pursue and annihilate them in separate routes.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The results of annihilating the invading bandits outside Zhangjiakou are brilliant. According to preliminary statistics from the military, in the two battles near Kongjiazhuang in Zhangtan West and Chenjiafang in Zhangjiakou Southeast alone, approximately 6,800 bandits, including brigade commanders and below, were killed or wounded, and approximately 2,000 were captured or surrendered. More than 300 long and short guns and more than 30 war horses were seized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] The annihilation battle in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway is progressing smoothly in victory.

<p>New York Daily News Editorial</p>
<p>[New York, United Press, 3rd] The Daily News stated in an editorial today: "Two hundred million Soviets cannot rule 450 million Chinese people. The Chinese people have always extremely despised any form of government, and will likely resist a Moscow-manipulated dictatorship.

If the Kremlin wants to control China, it is like biting off a big mouthful of food that cannot be digested. If control can be achieved, it will not happen for many years, and it will require much of the energy that Moscow is now spending in other Cold War areas, especially Western Europe."</p>

<h3>Industrial Self-Salvation</h3>
<p>— Xu Kejun</p>
<p>The recent industrial crisis has become increasingly serious. Labor and management are uneasy, disputes arise from time to time, and production is sluggish and difficult to expand. There is a worry of reaching the end of the road! The worker's cost of living index announced on November 15 was 8.1 times, and on the 30th of the same month it was increased to 15.4 times. From the perspective of workers' living needs, this index is not high. However, from the perspective of factories, the sales of finished products are not smooth, and expenditures are increasing day by day, making it truly unbearable. This situation is especially true for non-daily-use machinery manufacturing industries. For example, a historical engineering company in which I participate is facing huge overdrafts and struggling to plan for the future. This can be an example of the current difficulties of the machinery manufacturing industry. Furthermore, from November 15 to 30, prices generally fell. This increase in the index may be to compensate for a previously too low setting. During this half-month, the situation in factories has become even more depressed. Products are unsalable, prices are falling, and expenditures have suddenly doubled, truly reaching a point of desperation. Some say that factories should immediately request industrial loans to maintain themselves, which is also true. Factories requesting industrial loans, and the government, for the sake of maintaining industry, should approve them as appropriate. However, the national treasury is insufficient, and financial resources are very scarce, which will inevitably lead to the issuance of more currency. As a result, factories may not benefit, and the resulting malpractices will only increase the trend of gold purchases, affecting social order, which is also a cause for concern. Others suggest that since factories are difficult to maintain, it would be better to close them down. In fact, closing them down at this time is even more impossible. If factories close down, a huge number of workers will be unemployed. At this time of great turmoil, the unemployment problem is the most serious, and it can be asserted that it will disrupt social stability and create adverse consequences. What is more important is that industry is the lifeblood of the country and society, like the blood vessels of the human body. It must rely on this to circulate nutrients in order to grow and prosper. If industry stagnates, it is tantamount to strangling oneself and cutting off one's food supply. The consequences are unimaginable! Therefore, closing down factories is not the best policy. In this predicament, how can we save ourselves? In my humble opinion, only if factory authorities, technicians, and workers unite as a whole, work together with one heart, can we overcome this difficulty and find a way out together. There are two basic understandings that must be explained first:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of workers working is to engage in production and obtain appropriate remuneration to maintain their lives. The current method of remuneration is calculated in money, because money can be exchanged for necessities of life. If money cannot be exchanged or its exchange value is decreasing day by day, then workers will lose interest in monetary remuneration and will be willing to receive compensation in kind or in-kind payments to obtain what they need through exchange. If compensation can be made in kind, it is the most secure. We must recognize this point first.</p>
<p>(2) In the modern trend, labor and management are often out of sync. People in our country are affected by this and discriminate against those who run industries, often regarding them as capitalists or exploiters. This view is also wrong. Because our country's industry is still in its infancy, most manufacturers are struggling to operate, affected by internal turmoil and facing international competition. Their difficult situation is difficult to compare with the situation in other countries. Now, let us try to discuss the various aspects of factory authorities, technicians, and workers to see if their relationships are adversarial. In my humble opinion, since industry is the lifeblood of the country, it is of course very important. Those who run industries use their experience and intelligence to manage factories and do their best to put a large amount of human resources on the right track, engage in production, and create welfare. Their contribution is of great value, and their lifestyle is not overly extravagant. As for the shareholders who invest for profit, according to detailed statistics of the official profit dividends of several factories in recent years, the income is very small, and the facts are not difficult to understand. In short, among the general industrial leaders, although there may be some large capitalists, most of them can still prioritize their business and should not be placed entirely in the ranks of exploiters. As for engineers and technicians, they use their physical and mental labor to promote the development of factory affairs, and they are definitely laboring people, without any doubt. To sum up the relationship between these people, if we compare it to a family, then the factory leaders, managers, and technicians can be compared to older brothers; if we compare it to a school, they can be compared to the principal and teachers; the workers are like family members or students. They have a close relationship, share common interests, have no so-called boundaries, and should not have conflicts. At this difficult time, if we mistakenly believe that labor and management must be opposed and do not think of overcoming the crisis together, then we will all fall into a dead end, and it will be difficult to expect welfare. This point must be clearly understood first.</p>
<p>Based on the above opinions, I propose the following self-rescue methods:</p>
<p>(1) The Factory Side: The factory负责人负责人 and important cadres should immediately call the workers and have a sincere conversation to truly understand the current environment, and fully disclose the economic situation so that the authorities' sincerity and the difficulties they encounter are fully understood by the workers. Make a great determination together, and under the slogan of "As long as everyone has food to eat," work harder and increase production. As for the workers' daily food and the raw materials needed for production, the factory负责人负责人 should absolutely find ways to obtain them. For the food, if necessary, it may be possible to negotiate a loan from U.S. aid materials and exchange it at a price with the factory's existing or future finished products. Agricultural products or coal can be exchanged for machines needed in the morning villages, such as oil presses and grain harvesting machines, and machines needed in mines, such as water pumps and cranes, for daily use. As for raw materials, if funds are lacking for purchase, they should also be exchanged for existing or future finished products. However, this method must be actively supported and facilitated by the government, which is responsible for guaranteeing the credibility of the delivery of the finished products and their non-devaluing value. We firmly believe that this is the government's responsibility to the industrial community, and its assistance may even far exceed industrial loans, because there are no malpractices. In addition, if the factory needs small amounts of funds for purchasing grain and raw materials, it should ask the government to allow it to sell its future finished products to national banks in order to obtain funds to purchase grain or raw materials.</p>
<p>(2) The Worker Side: During this period, workers must obtain daily food and a minimum amount of pocket money. In view of the extraordinary environment, they should minimize their desires for life and convert their wages into finished products, that is, give them a corresponding portion of the finished products they have created. Therefore, although workers do not have a large amount of money income at present, they will definitely be able to obtain considerable materials in the future. In economic terms, it is like forced savings, which can follow market prices and are not afraid of devaluation, while encouraging increased production, which is very beneficial.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, this method is the most reasonable and will definitely be effective. If it can be implemented, no matter what difficulties there are, production can definitely be maintained, not only creating welfare for people and achieving the goal, but also eliminating all malpractices such as stimulating prices and purchasing gold. Factories will not go bankrupt, workers can avoid unemployment, social crises will be eliminated, and national strength will be increased. The welfare of the country and the people depends on it. However, what is mentioned in this article is only a principle. When it comes to the specific methods and technical details of implementation, various parties should formulate them in detail according to the actual situation in order to be practical and appropriate. Moreover, personal ideals are incomplete, and it is difficult to achieve results alone. I hope that all colleagues will have considerable interest in this method, supplement it and promote it. What is especially hoped is that the government, which has always been enthusiastic about promoting industry, must effectively guarantee the effectiveness and redemption of future bills of sale for finished products sold when selling future goods and purchasing raw materials on credit, or for certificates given to workers for finished products (for example, if a worker at a certain ink factory has a wage of 1,000 yuan, excluding 200 yuan for food, the 800 yuan should be converted into a certain number of bottles of ink, and the factory should issue a certificate, which is called a finished product certificate or ownership certificate), so that the general use of the futures bill is the same as a non-devaluing counter, and the belief in the endorsement exceeds the limited gold. If this method can be successfully promoted and achieve good results, then all the pain caused by currency and all the difficulties suffered by the industrial community will be relieved, and there will be no worries. What do colleagues think?</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the 4th passed the salt tax reform proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance.

<h3>It's Not Easy to Live in Hong Kong: Severe Housing Shortage, Rising Costs, No Way to Invest, "Refugees Are Depressed"</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to a passenger who returned to Shanghai by plane from Hong Kong yesterday, the recent situation in Hong Kong is as follows: (1) Within the past one or two months, due to the influx of a large number of people, the housing shortage in Hong Kong and Kowloon has become severe. All houses, large and small, require premium fees, and the prices are very high. Roughly speaking, for a modern house with three or four rooms, you can't expect to inquire without having 8,000 to 10,000 Hong Kong dollars. As for hotels, there are very few empty rooms in large hotels, so let's not talk about them. Even a third-class hotel requires 80 to 90 Hong Kong dollars a day, including food and accommodation, which shows how difficult it is. (2) Due to the large influx of people, there are few who produce and many who consume. Everyone feels that the cost of general daily life is difficult. Generally speaking, ordinary prices have risen about 20 times compared to before the war. It costs four yuan a bowl to eat an approximately full bowl of beef congee. You can imagine the rest. (3) Among the new entrants, most are from Beijing and Shanghai. There are, of course, many "high-class refugees," but there are also many mid-level civil servants who came south on assignments or with agencies. Most of these people arrived a month ago and brought their families and all their luggage. However, because they cannot afford to pay the premium for housing, they have to stay in hotels temporarily. At first, they thought they had entered paradise, but now, because there are more and more "refugees," their lives are greatly threatened, and they are already unable to support themselves. (4) Those who move into the high-class refugees later naturally have larger burdens and expenses than those who arrived earlier. Moreover, the ways to choose to invest in production are also proportionally narrower day by day. The money they bring is only being consumed and no interest is being generated. Over time, they feel depressed day by day and believe that they are not allowed to stay for long. When these people first entered the country, they only felt refreshed in body and mind. Looking north at the raging flames, they suddenly felt "fortunate to have left early." However, as time goes by and their capital decreases day by day, their thoughts of missing the real estate they left behind in the Beijing and Shanghai areas become more and more intense. Now, there are those who eagerly hope that the government will win the war and think of returning home, and there are also those who can't bear to read the Hong Kong versions of Wenhui Bao and Ta Kung Pao. Is it patriotism? Or is it worrying about the property they left behind in their motherland? Although it is impossible to know, it is very obvious that these people have inner distress.</p>

<h3>President Truman Implements New Deal; Formulates Social Welfare Plan; Relieves the Poor, Elderly, and Infirm; Increases Education Expenses; Attends to People's Health and Solves Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] According to reliable sources: President Truman is planning to add a department to the Cabinet to guide a large-scale social welfare program to make the American people healthier and happier. The establishment of this ministry will be approved by Congress. Observers believe that the new Democratic Congress will support it. Administration officials told United Press that President Truman will ask Congress to establish a new social welfare department. This letter will be submitted immediately after Congress opens on January 3 next year. Closely related to the social welfare plan is the short-term housing plan. The president and his aides hope to extend rent control for at least another year and have the government support the construction of low-cost, low-rent housing. In some respects, Truman's social welfare plan even exceeds that proposed by the late President Roosevelt, including: (1) Expanding social security benefits to millions of people who are not currently benefiting, and increasing subsidies for the poor and elderly. (2) A long-term national health plan, including health insurance, to provide adequate medical care to millions of people who are not currently able to afford it, with the goal of "extending basic health services and making them accessible to all people." (3) Increasing federal subsidies to states for building hospitals and other medical facilities, as well as medical research. (4) Increasing federal education subsidies, including funding for school buildings, teacher salaries, and other activities. (5) The government may provide subsidies to medical graduate students to solve the current shortage of physicians. Officials claim that the number of physicians nationwide is only 80 percent of what is needed. If the president's plan is implemented, the government's annual social welfare budget will increase by hundreds of millions of dollars. The current budget is already 1 billion, but the required expenses may be offset by increased social security taxes. In the current fiscal year, Congress has already appropriated $1,245,160,000 for the government's social welfare and education activities. Congress is likely to largely approve the president's increased request.</p>
<h3>Responds to the Neutral Nations Committee; Soviet Government States Its Position; Willing to Provide Information for Berlin Currency System Research; Security Council Has No Right to Interfere in Political Disputes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 4th] Radio Moscow broadcast a TASS dispatch on the 4th, providing a detailed response to the proposal by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia to establish a "neutral" committee, and clarifying the "Soviet position." The Soviet Union agreed to provide "necessary information" while the neutral countries worked on the Berlin currency system research committee, but refused the committee's mediation in the Berlin dispute.</p>

(2) Completely rejects Bramuglia's proposed "mediation" or "supervisory" committee. (3) The United States and France have stated that currency experts should consider the recent situation in Berlin. TASS said that "As for the other issues related to Berlin raised by Bramuglia in the past few days, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's speech in the Security Council can represent the Soviet Union's response to these issues." Vyshinsky stated the Soviet Union's attitude as follows: (1) The Security Council has no right to interfere in the Berlin issue; (2) The Berlin issue should be resolved by the four occupying powers. Western spokesmen said that the Soviet statement did not help the situation. They believe that as long as the Soviet Union does not stop dividing Berlin, Bramuglia's "last attempt" will not take effect. The West is currently drafting a supplementary memorandum to submit to the experts, detailing the Soviet Union's actions that have made the Berlin situation intolerable.</p>

He was unable to attend the ceremony himself, but Acting Secretary of State Lovett read his message on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Former U.S. Fleet Commander Warns Not to Underestimate Soviet Military Strength; Soviet Union Accuses U.S. of Using Japan as a Tool to Invade the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Monterey, California, 3rd] Retired four-star admiral Spruance, who served as commander of the Fifth Fleet during the war, told reporters on the 3rd that he warned the United States not to underestimate Soviet military strength. Spruance said, "Unless we become much stronger and Western Europe becomes much stronger, I don't want to meet the Soviet army on the battlefield. Their army is large and strong." Regarding the Soviet navy, Spruance said, "What we need to fear is the Soviet submarine. He requested that modern submarines have completely become a new problem in naval warfare. Spruance continued: (1) If China falls into the hands of the communists, then Southeast Asia and its abundant strategic raw materials will also fall into the hands of the communists. (2) Given time, the unification of the army, navy, and air force will take effect. But if the air force does not separate from the army, then he is more in favor of it. (3) The air force cannot independently adapt to the needs of future wars, and the navy cannot rely entirely on aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] Imayev wrote in the "Red Fleet" newspaper, sponsored by the Soviet Navy, today that MacArthur's reconstruction of a modern base for the U.S. Navy at the Yokosuka naval port in Japan is tantamount to the U.S. holding a gun to the chest of the various ethnic groups in Asia. The U.S. occupation authorities are also encouraging the revival of Japanese militarism and intend to use Japan as a tool to invade Asia and the Soviet Union. After expanding Japan's police force and reorganizing the Japanese army, the United States is now preparing to allow Japan to restore its navy.</p>
<h3>US Un-American Activities Committee Intercepts Secret Soviet Spy Documents</h3>
<p>Submitted by Former Communist Party Member Chambers</p>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 3rd] House investigators stated on the evening of the 3rd that Chambers, who confessed to being a former Communist Party member, had provided them with copies of "hundreds of" secret documents that had been stolen from the State Department by Communist underground operatives before 1938. Representative Mundt, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, stated that these documents "definitely prove" the existence of a Communist spy organization. Mundt further stated that these documents were given to Chambers "to be handed over to a Soviet Communist Party spy." Mundt did not specify who gave the documents to Chambers. Mundt's official statement was issued to reporters by the committee's lawyer, Stripling, and stated that the importance of the documents handed over by Chambers to the committee and the revelation of the vastness of the Communist spy organization within the State Department far exceeded anything the committee had obtained in its ten-year history. According to Stripling, the documents were handed over by Chambers on the evening of the 2nd at his Westminster farm, and were photographic reductions. Mundt continued that the committee is now keeping these documents under 24-hour surveillance, and that these documents have been the object of a ten-year search by US government agents.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Hungarian Army</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Budapest, 3rd] The Hungarian government decided today to reorganize the army. Palffy remains the Chief of the Army, and Szombathelyi remains the Chief of the General Staff. The reorganization proposal may have been put forward by Minister of Defense Farkas, who advocated the inclusion of the Communist Party in the army as political commissars to implement political education for soldiers.</p>
<h3>UN Political Committee Passes British Proposal to Establish a Mediation Committee for the Holy Land; Bunche to Visit Authorities in Arab and Jewish Regions in the Middle East</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 4th] The UN Political Committee this morning passed the British proposal to establish a Palestine Mediation Committee by a vote of 25 to 21 with 9 abstentions. However, the passage of this proposal does not meet the one-third vote required for the UN to pass resolutions, so any decision on Palestine by the General Assembly must be revised or a new proposal put forward. Before the vote on this proposal, the Political Committee passed the Canadian amendment by a vote of 24 to 21 with 8 abstentions, which stipulates that the three-member committee of the Mediation Committee should be designated by a special committee that includes members from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 4th] UN Acting Mediator Bunche arrived here from Paris this morning and will meet with Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi to discuss matters. He will also travel to Amman, Haifa, and Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 4th] Lee, the head of the UN Mediation Advisory Group, who arrived here this morning, told Agence France-Presse that the situation in Palestine, generally speaking, has improved. When asked if it was true that Czechoslovakia was supplying Israel with arms, Lee said that most airports in Palestine are monitored by UN observers and US destroyers are patrolling the Palestinian coast, so this rumor is probably untrue.</p>
<h3>Egyptian University Students Stage Anti-Government Demonstrations</h3>

<h3>Asian Economic Conference Discusses Japanese Economic Problems</h3>
<p>US Representative Advocates Expanding Japanese Production</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Lake Success, 4th] Whitman, the US Deputy Representative to the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, said at the meeting today that the United States firmly believes that Japan's economic self-sufficiency to maintain its minimum living standard is a necessary condition for ensuring the security of the Far East. When discussing Japan's economic problems, he said that in order for Japan to survive in the world as a peaceful and free nation, it must rebuild its foreign trade. Currently, Japan's industrial production is only half of its capacity, so even within the existing policies of the Economic Commission for the Far East, there is still great room for expansion of Japanese production. Furthermore, he believes that restoring Japan's foreign trade will enable Japan to be self-sufficient at a minimum living standard and thus develop its domestic industries.</p>
<h3>Tojo's Final Words Actually Advocate Non-War</h3>
<p>Believes War Cannot Resolve Disputes</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 4th] According to the priest Hanayama, who prays for Tojo and others at Sugamo Prison, he told reporters: "I had a one-hour conversation with Tojo on November 25th. At that time, Tojo told me his final words, which I can only announce in full after his execution, as per his request. However, the nature of these final words is an appeal to people from all over the world. In his final words, Tojo emphasized that war is not an effective way to resolve international disputes. Tojo wrote these words when he was preparing to commit suicide after the surrender, but because he did not die immediately, they have not been published until now."</p>
<h3>Allied Experts to Complete Economic Revival Plan for Japan by Mid-Week; Goal is to Make Japan Self-Sufficient</h3>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 4th] Experts from the Allied Budget Committee are expected to complete the detailed content of the economic revival plan by mid-week, which aims to make Japan self-sufficient in a few years. Although the committee members refused to discuss their activities, according to UPI from reliable sources, the scope of the Budget Committee's activities includes: (1) The committee will present the results of its thorough research on Japan achieving a semi-self-sufficient economy in a relatively short period of time; (2) Propose budget allocations for the initial stage of Japan's revival; (3) The initial stage will focus on expanding the import of industrial raw materials. Although the import of raw materials will be expanded in the initial stage, the committee and all relevant agencies in Washington are focusing on every aspect of Japan's import and export economy from the perspective of increasing Japan's exports to the maximum extent to pay for its imports. The plan proposed by the committee will include all the details, but because its opinions are directly related to funding, they will not be disclosed. However, well-informed sources pointed out that Japan must import basic industrial raw materials such as oil, iron ore, pig iron, coal, lead, tin, natural rubber, zinc, nickel, aluminum ore, wool, and cotton. Although these people did not predict the number of years in the "relatively short period" or the detailed content of imports and exports, they pointed out that the committee's plan may be based on the recent speech by Lubin. According to Lubin: "Japan's exports have increased in the past year, reaching US$200 million, but before they can pay for the food and raw materials necessary to maintain Japan's low living standards, they must increase the current amount seven to eight times." Well-informed sources said: The committee's revival plan will help Japan gradually achieve self-sufficiency, saving the United States at least US$400 million annually.</p>

<h3>Shigeru Yoshida Strongly Advocates Holding Re-elections to Establish a Japanese Democratic Government; Indicates Decision to Dissolve the House of Representatives After Mid-Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 4th] Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida expressed his determination to dissolve the Japanese House of Representatives after mid-month when he addressed the parliament this afternoon. He said: Japan needs to sign a peace treaty as soon as possible in order to achieve independence. If Japan does not have a real democratic government, then a peace treaty cannot be expected. A democratic government can only be established through another general election. When he addressed the plenary session of the House of Representatives in the afternoon, he pointed out that the one-and-a-half-year period since the first election after the enactment of the new Japanese constitution "was a period of political instability."</p>
<p>He also said: "Workers are becoming increasingly powerful, the national economy is declining, and production is far below expectations." He said that the establishment of his minority cabinet and the political situation in Japan both require elections to stabilize Japan's extremely chaotic political situation after the war. He emphasized that without another election, a true democratic government cannot be firmly established in Japan, and without a firmly established democratic government, a peace treaty cannot be expected. He revealed that, according to the agreement reached between the government and the opposition parties, the House of Representatives will be dissolved two weeks after the government submits the supplementary budget and the bill to revise wage standards.</p>
<h3>US West Coast Shipping Resumes; Aid to China Materials to Be Shipped Out as Soon as Possible; USS Meigs to Sail to Shanghai First</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency San Francisco, 3rd] Several cargo ships that have been stranded on the Pacific coast since September 2nd will sail to the Far East next week, as the 93-day dockworkers' strike officially ended today. The duration of this strike was second only to the labor unrest in 1936, when dockworkers on the Pacific coast went on strike for 98 days. The end of this labor unrest was the result of 22 days of negotiations between labor and management. Shipping companies said today that 50% of the cargo ships will sail to the Far East next week, resuming maritime transportation on the Pacific. The first liner to sail to Shanghai will be the USS Meigs, which is scheduled to depart around the 17th of this month. A total of 265 ships were stranded on the Pacific coast during the three months of this strike, including 70 docked in San Francisco. It is expected that after the resumption of shipping, the transportation of aid to China materials will be accelerated. Some aid to China materials here have been shipped from Galveston, Texas, but it takes almost two weeks longer than the San Francisco-Shanghai route.</p>
<h3>West Berlin Elections Today; Can Observe German Political Trends; British Members of Parliament Invited to Observe</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 4th] West Berlin will begin electing a new government tomorrow, and even if the Soviet army wants to prevent citizens from participating in the vote, it may be unable to do so. Only three parties are participating in the election, but the voting results can also reveal German political trends. Active voting can prove support for Britain and the United States, while sluggish voting can prove support for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 3rd] The Berlin Communist Party launched a terrorist campaign today in hopes of preventing the people of Berlin from participating in the West Berlin municipal elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 3rd] A group of British members of the lower house of parliament invited by the British military government to observe the municipal elections here has arrived today, including two Conservative Party members and several Labour Party members.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Asia</h3>
<p>— Translated by 礝石</p>
<p>The author of this article, Joseph Fromm, is an experienced journalist who is the Far East correspondent for "US News &amp; World Report" magazine. Since the end of World War II, he has been assigned to the Far East. He has traveled to Japan, North China, Indochina, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, and India. During his travels, he had many conversations with officials, soldiers, and politicians from various places. Now, he published this article on October 1st, providing a comprehensive report on the expansion of Soviet forces in Asia.</p>
<p>While Communist forces in Europe are temporarily calmer, Communist forces in Asia are rising. Since the past six months, Communist forces have been expanding very successfully. Judging from this success, Asia has a very high possibility of becoming Communist Asia, although there is no possibility of achieving this goal by next year or the year after, but it may be completed within five or ten years at least.</p>
<p>At the same time, the credibility and influence of the United States in the Far East are declining. In Japan, China, the Philippines, Indochina, Malaya, the East Indies, Burma, and India, it is clearly showing that the United States and the West are losing their position in the Cold War due to self-deception. In this vast area with a population of one billion, nationalism and independence movements are now popular.</p>
<p>The main reason for the success of communism in Asia is the lack of a definite decision-making process for the Far East by the United States and Western powers. When the United States provided a large amount of aid to Japan, agitators took the opportunity to incite those areas that had previously been occupied by Japan. At the same time, they engaged in inciting the natives of various regions to launch independence movements to resist France, Britain, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Due to oppression, poverty, and the inability of farmers to live and cultivate peacefully, nationalism and communist ideas arose. The Soviet Union took advantage of this weakness to gain friends in various parts of Asia and cultivate its potential. In order to gain friendship in Europe, the United States had to support the colonial authorities, so the Soviet Union took advantage of this point and promised to provide assistance in various ways to the native rebellions.</p>
<p>The offensive launched by the Communist authorities in various Asian countries varies with the environment. In Indochina and Indonesia, the offensive adopted by the Communists is the nationalist movement, and they have also armed those liberals who dreamed that the United States could support them after the end of the war against Japan.</p>
<p>In China, the Communist Party has seized areas with a population of 150 million. The offensive they launched is the so-called land reform, which is praised by the masses, and encourages farmers to participate in the war of liquidation against landlords.</p>
<p>In Malaya, small and armed communist parties have launched a fierce war against Britain. At that time, the Communists in Burma were also leading an armed war against the socialist government.</p>
<p>The Communist Asian Intelligence Bureau is the mastermind of this movement, and the Soviet Union took the opportunity to cultivate anti-American sentiment among the people in the region. In the early days of the end of the war, the United States had a high reputation in Asia, but now its reputation is gradually declining.</p>
<p>Many people in Asian colonies and others had a hope for the situation of Japan's defeat, because according to the Four-Power Declaration and the Pacific Charter, the people of the colonies could no longer be oppressed, and they could also gain autonomy. Due to the United States' policy toward Asia during the war, this deeply convinced the people of Asia of the United States. They thought that when peace came, the United States would fight for the independence and freedom of the colonial people of Asia.</p>
<p>However, the focus of post-war American diplomacy was on European reconstruction and preventing the expansion of Soviet power into Western Europe. As a result, all decisions regarding Asia were classified as secondary and often mistaken by the American authorities. Although the United States has almost lost all its allies in Asia today, American foreign policy has not turned around. There will be a Communist Asia in the world, but the United States seems to be unaware of this future threat, and its eyes are only focused on Europe. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>SS Kiang Ya Explodes and Sinks; Most of 3,000 Passengers Missing; About 1,000 Survivors; Cause of Accident Being Investigated</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo line passenger ship, the SS Kiang Ya, departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. At around 7 p.m., while sailing in the waters of Litongsha Yang outside Songkou, it suddenly exploded and sank. Most of the 3,000 passengers on board were killed or injured. With the cooperation of all parties, the rescue efforts continued from that night until yesterday. As of last night, about 1,000 people had been rescued and arrived in Shanghai. The exact number of people who drowned at sea is still unknown. According to the total number of tickets sold by the company and the possible number of additional "scalped" passengers, it is estimated that the number of deaths is around 2,000. As for the cause of the accident, there are various rumors, and the actual cause is still under investigation.</p>
<p>The SS Kiang Ya was acquired by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from the Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kabushiki Kaisha and renamed from the Kōa Maru. It was one of the largest passenger ships on the company's Shanghai-Ningbo line, with a speed of 14 knots per hour, a length of 340.4 feet, a width of 50 feet, and a deadweight of 2,099 tons. It originally had 28 special class cabins, 36 first class cabins, 46 second class cabins, 555 third class cabins, and 571 fourth class cabins, with a total capacity of 1,186 passengers. After renovation, the Maritime Bureau passenger license allowed for 2,250 passengers.</p>
<h3>Loud Noise Suddenly Heard from the Stern; Sinks Within Three Minutes</h3>
<p>On this trip from Shanghai to Ningbo, a total of 2,207 tickets were sold and there were 191 crew members. It set sail at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, and at around 7 p.m. it passed through the waterway east of Bailonggang, southwest of Hengsha (121.47 degrees north latitude, 31.15 degrees east longitude). A loud noise suddenly came from the stern, and an extremely strong explosion occurred near the third cabin on the right side, reaching the three-story deck in the rear. In an instant, the lights inside the ship went out. The motor stopped, and the stern began to sink rapidly, submerging into the water within three minutes. The middle and front of the ship also gradually sank. When the crew members realized that there was an accident, there was no way to save the situation, and because the radio station had been destroyed, it was impossible to send out a distress signal. At that time, most of the passengers in the third class cabins near the explosion had no way to escape. The first, second, special class cabins and the fourth class passengers on the deck were awakened by the loud explosion. Knowing the ship was in danger, they witnessed the ship gradually being swallowed by the waves. In the vast sea, it was dark, and they were immediately shocked and at a loss, crying and screaming. In the chaos, some jumped into the sea, some scrambled for lifeboats, and some gathered on the front mast and chimney, countless of whom were swept away by the waves. In the final moments, only the highest deck in the front was still exposed above the water. Fortunately, the Wah Foong Company's Wah Foong ship was passing by. But the Wah Foong ship did not initially notice the Kiang Ya accident in the darkness. Passengers on the Kiang Ya urgently used flashlights to send out distress signals, and the Wah Foong ship approached to rescue, while also sending out distress signals on behalf of the Wah Foong.</p>
<h3>Receiving Telegrams; Sending Ships to Rescue</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received this telegram at around 9 p.m. that night and immediately dispatched four ships, the Chiu Chin, Chi An, Kiang Tsing, and Hai Tsing, to the rescue. It also requested the Chinese navy to send the Mount Omei warship and the US Navy to send two warships to the rescue. At the same time, ships such as the Kin Yuan Li, Mao Li, and fishing boats and sailing ships that were passing by also went to the rescue after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, the company again sent the head of the maritime affairs department, Fan Lun, leading two tugboats, Tuan Chiang and Kuo Shan, towing two large iron barges, along with more than 50 divers and workers to the accident site to continue the rescue efforts.</p>
<h3>More Than Sixty Crew Members Missing</h3>
<p>As of last night, about 1,000 passengers had been rescued and sent to Shanghai by various ships. The injured have been sent to hospitals such as the Kung Tsi, Jen Chi, and China-America hospitals for treatment. Among the senior crew members rescued were shipowner Shen Dacai, Chief Officer Zhu Jinchang, Chief Engineer Hu Caiyang, Third Engineer Zhang Qingfang, Business Director Zheng Shouye, and radio operator Tu Zheng. Those missing include Chief Engineer Wang Wenchao, Second Engineer Zhang Fubao, Chief Radio Operator Han Yucheng, and more than sixty junior crew members.</p>
<h3>Diverse Speculation About the Cause of the Accident</h3>
<p>Regarding the circumstances of the accident, the shipowner has already reported to the company and forwarded it to the Maritime Bureau yesterday, and the cause of the accident will be thoroughly investigated. According to the shipowner, when the ship arrived at the accident site, two small civilian ships were found on the direct route ahead. At that time, they were instructed to leave by signal. Initially, the two ships ignored the signal, but after another signal was sent, they complied and sailed away. At this time, the explosion occurred. But it is difficult to explain whether the two ships were related to the explosion. As for the location of the explosion, it is said that it was not inside the boiler room, so the theory of a boiler explosion is not reliable. It is also rumored that criminals on the ship planted time bombs, or that dozens of soldiers carrying military equipment were on board, and the explosion was caused by the military equipment. However, these are all speculations and not credible. In short, the cause of the accident still needs to be investigated and studied.</p>
<h3>A Sea of Cries in Front of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Since the tragedy of the ship occurred, the families of the passengers were shocked and panicked when they heard the news. Yesterday, hundreds of people went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to inquire about the news, and many women were crying and weeping in front of the company, which was a heartbreaking sight. According to the company's person in charge, regarding the aftermath, the company recently insured the passengers' safety with an insurance company. The medical expenses of the injured will be borne by the company. Passengers who were rescued and wish to continue to Ningbo can take the company's Kiang Tsing ship from Shanghai for free tomorrow, otherwise they can get a refund of the ticket fee. The company will pay more attention to the issue of navigation safety in the future. The total amount of the loss is currently unable to be estimated.</p>
<h3>Three Requests from the Families of the Victims</h3>
<p>[Another News] This newspaper received a letter from a reader named Zhuan Qizhao yesterday, stating that his mother was also on the ship, and her fate is still unknown as of last night. He also said that he intends to request the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to handle the following matters: (1) Continue to find ways to rescue; (2) Expedite the salvage of corpses; (3) If there are passing ships that provide rescue, please quickly find out.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Passenger Ships Changed to One Trip Every Other Day</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo line passenger ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were originally the Kiang Ya and Kiang Tsing ships. Except for Sundays, they sailed between Shanghai and Ningbo every day at 4:30 p.m. Now, because only one ship is operating after the accident of the Kiang Ya ship, it has been changed to one trip every other day, departing at 6 a.m. Therefore, the Kiang Tsing ship did not depart yesterday, but will depart for Ningbo at 6 a.m. this morning.</p>

<h3>Demanding the Opening of Industrial Loans: Satisfactory Outcome of the Petition; Committee to Discuss Procedures Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the request from various industries in the city for the government to open industrial loans, a consensus has been reached between various industries and the Central Bank authorities. Yesterday at 9:00 AM, representatives from the city's steel industry, Shen Yanfa; pharmaceutical industry, Chen Fengrui; wool textile industry, Yang Liren; paper-making industry, Xie Tiansha; aluminum industry, Guo Yongxi; color printing industry, Huang Shenming; machinery industry, Hu Shuxi; porcelain industry, Xu Bingxiang; leather-making industry, Zhang Shanzhang; and shirt-making industry, Chuan Liangjun, together with Ouyang Lun from the Industrial Association, went to petition Finance Minister Xu Kan and Central Bank President Yu, but because Minister Xu and President Yu had important official business, they were received by Vice President Liu Gongyun and Lin Chongyong. The representatives presented the various difficulties faced by the industries, especially the paper-making and electrical industries, which are suffering from a sharp drop in finished product prices and extremely high wages, making it difficult to delay. Under these emergency circumstances, if the government does not provide prompt relief, it will inevitably affect social stability. They requested the immediate release of emergency industrial loans to meet the urgent needs of factories and requested allocation of funds to purchase finished products from various industries, or loans for ordering goods. After careful consideration, Vice President Liu decided in principle to grant loans. As for all procedures, interest rates, and the total amount of the loan, they will be submitted to the committee for discussion tomorrow. The various industries will send Hu Boxiang, Xie Tiansha, Guo Shuixi, and Chen Fengrui to attend the meeting with Ouyang Lun from the Industrial Association to present their case.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Refugee Students Leaving for Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Over a thousand refugee students from Henan and Shandong in Shanghai planned to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to go to Jiangxi, but the passenger cars were crowded and there was no way to accommodate them. Until 4:00 AM yesterday, the two railway bureaus specially allocated more than twenty cars to form a train for the students to go to Jiangxi. Due to a shortage of locomotives, the train was delayed in departing. The refugee students, unable to wait any longer, flocked to the station master's office to negotiate and urge the departure. Due to a misunderstanding in language, they clashed with the on-duty station master, Zhang Xikun, who was beaten and injured in the head. The station master's office was also vandalized. Later, the station police arrived to suppress the situation and promised to depart the train immediately, and the dispute was resolved. The train borrowed the locomotive from the Shanghai-Nanjing train number 52 and departed at 5:38 AM.</p>
<h3>Bribery Case of the Fuel Management Committee: Sun Jice Applies for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the verdict in the bribery and corruption case of senior officials of the Fuel Management Committee, Sun Jice, dissatisfied with the verdict, applied for a retrial yesterday. It has not yet been decided whether the other defendants will apply for a retrial.</p>
<h3>Rent Increases Are Staggering: Directly Threatening the Livelihoods of Ordinary People and Will Affect Social Order; Tenants' Union to Formulate Countermeasures Today</h3>
<p>When the "August 19th" Financial Emergency Decree was promulgated, the standard for rents across the country was originally scheduled to be drafted and implemented by the central government in a unified manner. Later, due to the revision of the price control policy, this new standard has not yet been announced. In this city, although the city council had requested the Land Administration Bureau to implement the standard in June of this year, limiting business premises to nine thousand times the pre-war level and residential premises to seven thousand times the pre-war level, this standard, according to the council's original resolution, expired at the end of September this year. After October, there was no basis for calculating rents, and rental disputes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau had previously publicly stated that he hoped that all rent disputes would be resolved through negotiations between landlords and tenants to make reasonable adjustments. Unexpectedly, some real estate owners have used this as an excuse to unilaterally increase rents recently. The entire board of directors of the Shanghai Tenants' Union believes that this illegal rent increase not only directly threatens the livelihoods of ordinary people but will also affect the entire social order, which must not be ignored. It has already notified all its member representatives and invited members of the press in the city to hold a symposium on rent issues at 3:00 PM today at the Daguan Society at 354 Nanjing West Road to discuss reasonable solutions to the rent issue, so that they can act in unison, appeal to all sectors for assistance, oppose unreasonable rent increases, maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people, and stabilize social order. It is reported that the proposed increase in rents by real estate owners in this city this time is staggering and is widespread among middle and lower-class houses, which will have a very serious threat to the livelihoods of ordinary people. For example, a tenant representative said that the monthly rent of each building in Cha Li, Tian Tong Road, Zhejiang North Road, managed by Yi Pin Bank, was only 1.5 million legal tender before the "August 19th" currency reform. Recently, all tenants were suddenly notified that, starting from September, the rent would be adjusted to more than 190 gold yuan per month, an increase of about 400 times.</p>
<h3>Hotel Prices Also Increase: Allowed to Add 21 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The issue of adjusting the room rates of hotels (i.e., small inns) in the city has been verified by representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union. From now on, prices will be increased by 21 times based on the price limit.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and Commander Chen Jointly Entertain the Press</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Guozhen and Songhu Garrison Commander Chen Daqing hosted the local press yesterday at 5:00 PM to exchange views. More than 30 heads of newspapers, including Pan Gongzhan, attended. First, Fang Zhi reported on his visit to Beijing to comfort the Air Force, saying: The first priority for suppressing bandits in the front is victory, and the first priority for the people in the rear is calmness. They have now scheduled to visit Bengbu next Monday to comfort the troops, and they hope that citizens will actively donate items. Then, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, saying: In order to seek permanent freedom, we should temporarily restrain excessive freedom, and he suggested that the authorities should inspect the mail to prevent printed materials that promote bandits from spreading among the people and confusing people's minds. Mayor Wu said: In this extraordinary period, I hope the press will understand the government's difficulties in implementing various measures, and I hope the people will strengthen their faith. Commander Chen, in addition to detailing the factors that will lead to victory in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, also advocated for the dispersal of unemployed vagrants who do not engage in production to stabilize society. The meeting ended at 6:30 PM.</p>

<h3>50,000 Cigarette Workers in the City Request Tax Relief to Maintain Livelihoods</h3>
<p>Due to the recent impact of the war, the scope of foreign sales has been greatly reduced, resulting in overproduction and a sharp drop in market prices. Just as cigarette manufacturers in the city were struggling to maintain their operations, the Ministry of Finance suddenly announced on the 1st of this month that it would increase the cigarette tax by seven times, further increasing their difficulties. Cigarettes that originally sold for 7,000 yuan per carton must now be sold for 49,000 yuan after the tax increase, but even at 6,000 yuan, there are few buyers. Therefore, many cigarette factories have suspended operations due to their inability to operate, and there are many rumors of bankruptcy. The 50,000 cigarette workers in the city, whose livelihoods have been directly affected by this increase in cigarette tax, discussed ways to make a living at the Cigarette Workers' Welfare Association yesterday. They unanimously passed a resolution to send eleven representatives, including Zhou Xuexiang, Cheng Shunxing, and Chen Sanlian, permanent members of the association, to petition the Direct Taxation Bureau and the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a gradual increase in taxes to overcome the current difficulties. It is said that if they do not achieve their goals, they will go to Beijing to directly petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Partial Reimbursement of Rice for Cloth: Rice Industry Association Submits Application for Review</h3>

However, after the end of the association's management work, there has been no concrete reimbursement, and the stipulated 20% of white rice to be handed over to the People's Mediation Committee has also not been complied with. Under the separate orders of the Social Affairs Bureau and the People's Mediation Committee, the industry association has submitted a register of sold rice yesterday. The purchasing units include the first and third branch offices of the association and the Rice Milling Industry Association, which purchased a total of 4,110 dan before October 20 and 7,329 dan before October 20. The amount purchased by the second branch office has not yet been submitted and is currently being urged by the People's Mediation Committee.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Law on Punishing Opium and Drug Trafficking has been passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, and the implementation period has been extended by one year.

The major opium cases include the case of Wang Zhibin, a legislator of the Democratic Socialist Party, who transported a large amount of opium from Beiping to Shanghai. According to the judge in charge of opium cases at the district court yesterday, Wang Zhibin's case was caught on the spot when he got off the plane, and the facts of his crime are very clear.

<h3>Three Generations Head to Ningbo, Grandchildren Die Tragically, Five Lives Lost, Rescued Woman Tells of Abandoning Child to Save Herself</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] When the Jiangya Wheel encountered disaster and sank at Qiutongsha, a Fei family of six, spanning three generations, from Cian Lane, Malang Road, also boarded the ship to Ningbo. The six people were the grandfather, daughter-in-law, three grandchildren, and the daughter-in-law's father. Now, only the daughter-in-law has survived. According to the daughter-in-law, the circumstances of the accident, her escape, and her rescue were too tragic to bear. When the ship exploded, it was after 8:00 PM. There was a loud bang, and the whole ship shook. Knowing that something terrible had happened, Mrs. Fei reluctantly abandoned her nursing infant in the third-class cabin and rushed to the deck with her four- and six-year-old children to escape. By then, the ship was in complete chaos. Her own father followed his daughter to escape, but they were soon separated in the chaos, their fates unknown. Her father-in-law's berth was said to be close to the site of the explosion, so he was likely also killed. When Mrs. Fei reached the deck with her two children, there was another loud bang, and the ship quickly sank into the water. The mother and children struggled in the water for half an hour, close to drowning, when a rescue ship arrived. They saw her hair floating on the surface, but they could not pull her up by her hair. So, they threw a rope for her to grab. But with two children in her hands, she could not hold onto the rope. She had no choice but to painfully throw one child into the water, freeing one hand to hold the rope. But the strength of one hand was not enough to climb up. Finally, she threw the second child into the water as well, grabbed the rope with both hands, and managed to climb up to safety. Out of the whole family of six, she was the only one who was rescued and returned yesterday morning. Both arms were severely injured. When she recounted her experience of abandoning her children to save herself, she was overcome with grief. It was truly a tragic scene in this world.</p>

<h3>Labor Disputes Decreased, Bureau Explains, Two Reasons</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Labor disputes in Shanghai have gradually decreased recently. According to the person in charge of the Labor Office of the Social Bureau yesterday, the reasons are: first, the government implemented martial law, and workers are not allowed to strike or go on strike; second, the cost of living has increased, and workers' lives have improved compared to the past. Currently, most of the disputes that occur are due to factories being unable to maintain operations and requesting to suspend operations and lay off workers, and the industries with the most disputes are machinery, silk weaving, knitting, light bulbs, and glass. The Social Bureau is making every effort to mediate these disputes, hoping that both labor and management will adopt a spirit of understanding and seek appropriate solutions.</p>

<h3>Confidence Firm, Credit Looser: Rice Prices Surged Yesterday, Flour, Grain, Oil, and Cakes Generally Rose, Market Sentiment Buoyant</h3>
<p>The rice market rebounded sharply yesterday, with a strong upward trend. Because the household rice price was similar to the market price, people's confidence immediately turned firm. Coupled with the continued loosening of credit and rising prices reported from the production areas, rice shops saw active sales and strengthened capital turnover, leading to exceptionally buoyant trading at the start of the day. The Nanshi market saw a particularly strong upward trend, opening with a call of 100 yuan higher, softening slightly at the close, but ultimately seeing a gain of 70 to 80 yuan. Superior japonica and thin indica each traded outside of 400 yuan, at 420 yuan. The Beishi market saw a slightly weaker upward trend than the Nanshi market, with superior japonica and thin indica each opening at 400 yuan, gaining 50 yuan. Indica rice rose 30 to 40 yuan. Total arrivals at the two markets amounted to 8,787 shi.</p>
<p>Flour rebounded sharply. Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, people's sentiment was excited and bullish. With credit having loosened and capital turnover strengthened, the market opened with a significant surge. Lao Che brand flour reached a high of 141 yuan, and Bingshan flour saw 130 yuan. At the close, profits were taken at the higher prices, with Lao Che closing at 130 yuan and Bingshan at 124 yuan, each up 15 to 16 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by about 15 percent, and bran rose by 12 yuan.</p>
<p>With the rebound in rice prices, sentiment for coarse grains was firm and bullish, and cargo owners held on to their goods. Soybeans ultimately rose by 20 yuan. Corn and red sorghum saw active trading and each rose by more than 20 yuan. Sorted green beans rose by 10 yuan, green beans rose firmly, sesame rose by 30 to 40 yuan, and raw kernels were actively purchased by the Guangdong trading houses, rising by 40 to 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil rose across the board. With rice prices rising sharply, people's sentiment turned firm, credit loosened, and capital turnover strengthened. Soybean oil factories opened at 720 yuan, and rapeseed oil at 600 yuan, before spot prices reached 610 yuan, each up 100 yuan. Jibao brand raw oil rose by 120 yuan, closing at 840 yuan. Xiaoche sesame oil rose by 60 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 10 yuan across the board.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Weak and Unable to Recover</h3>
<p>The tea market's weakness continues to spread. The reason for this is that since cargo owners have been eager for funds and willing to sell red and green tea at discounted prices, buyers have been relentlessly cutting prices, leading to a weakening market sentiment and a downward trend in prices. Transactions remain limited, as general sentiment remains bearish, so buying interest has not yet developed.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Apparently Firm but Actually Weak</h3>
<p>Sugar futures opened at 380 yuan yesterday morning, but with few takers, the market trended downwards, ultimately closing at 355 yuan, a gain of 15 yuan from the previous session. Coarse sand rose by 30 yuan, to 33 yuan. Other grades also generally showed improvement from the previous session. However, yesterday was Saturday, and trading was for the opening positions of the coming week, with two days' worth of interest for the weekend. Therefore, although yesterday's trading was brisk, it was actually apparently firm but actually weak. Credit in the industry has turned looser, and underground interest rates have also fallen to 20 to 25 yuan per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Firm and Brisk; Market Scheduled to Resume Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market saw credit gradually loosen, prices for various commodities outside the industry rise, and the cotton yarn market scheduled to officially convene and trade on Monday (the 6th). People's confidence rose sharply. Furthermore, with news of military victories spreading, large Guangdong trading houses continued to seek and purchase goods for transport south, and buying interest was strong, leading to a buoyant market trend.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at a high price of 600 yuan, with those holding goods taking the opportunity to sell. Near the close, prices were called back to 11,400 yuan, an increase of 800 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse yarn, due to strong demand, once briefly broke through the 10,000 yuan mark before closing at 9,800 yuan, a sharp rise of 1,800 yuan. Single Double Horse yarn traded around 9,000 yuan, ultimately closing at 9,100 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also generally rose by 500 to 600 yuan to around 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market continued to see strong buying interest as Guangdong and Hubei trading houses continued to seek and purchase goods for transport south, and those holding goods held up prices. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially opened flat, but with active local buyers, prices rose as high as 400 yuan at one point. However, at the close, the price fell back to 390 yuan due to the allocation of Fangjian cloth. A certain dye factory, due to slow sales of colored cloth in various regions, sold off Longtou white cloth. The price fell back to 390 yuan, a gain of 20 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Sijunzi gabardine, due to renewed searches by Hubei trading houses, rose to 400 yuan, a gain of 25 yuan. Other cloths saw firm trading as trading houses from Sichuan, Guangdong, Hubei, and other regions all made purchases.</p>
<p>Further News: Although the Yarn and Cloth Association once again submitted a request to the Social Bureau for permission to resume business, it has not yet received any orders from the Social Bureau. Officials from the two industries believe that it is difficult for the thousand or so brokers to maintain their livelihoods, and that further delays in resuming business will greatly affect operations. It has now been decided to resume business on a trial basis tomorrow, regardless of whether an order from the Social Bureau is received. The association has completed all preparations for reopening.</p>
<h3>Chung Hsing Textile Distribution</h3>
<p>Chung Hsing Textile distributed 10,100 bolts of cloth yesterday, as well as 6,250 pounds of remnant cloth, totaling 3,910,750 yuan. In addition, the Chung Hsing Textile retail department has been entrusted by the Shanghai Operating Office of the Copper and Iron Enterprise Committee of the Assets Committee to sell a batch of dark-colored cloths such as Shilin twill khaki.</p>
<h3>Serious Outflow of Capital to the South, 5 Million Yuan Daily</h3>
<p>The outflow of capital to the south from Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. According to estimates from financial circles, the recent daily outflow of capital to the south has reached more than 5 million yuan. Among these, state-owned banks and bureaus have stricter restrictions, so the outflow is smaller, while the outflow from private banks and firms is larger, and even greater from foreign banks. This fact deserves attention and may lead to adverse consequences.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Association Reduces Exchange Guarantee Deposits for Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association, in order to reduce the exchange guarantee deposits for member banks, yesterday issued a notice to all banks, stating that member banks and firms with total deposits of less than 50,000 yuan may pay half of the stipulated 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Companies and Businesses Concurrently Operating Banking Business: Will Be Ordered to Cease Operations If Discovered; Ministries of Finance and Industry Negotiate Penalty Standards</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The National Bank Auditing Office recently sent a circular to all branches, stating that it has received an electric message from the Ministry of Finance regarding the penalty standards for ordinary companies and businesses concurrently operating banking business, which have been negotiated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The original electric message from the Ministry of Finance is reproduced below:</p>
<p>"Regarding the penalty standards for ordinary companies and businesses privately concurrently operating banking business, as approved by the Ministry of Finance on November 22nd, Finance Currency Geng No. 270 electric message, previously negotiated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, branches should comply and report to your bank for reference. Furthermore, it has been found that some of the companies and businesses subject to such cases have not registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or local competent authorities. Whether these can be directly penalized according to the penalty standards without consultation and verification has been inquired. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has replied, stating that according to the current company regulations, a company cannot be established until it has registered with the central competent authority. Furthermore, businesses should also apply to the local competent authority for approval and registration before they can be established. The Executive Yuan has previously approved and ordered compliance.

<h3>Machinery Goes to the Countryside: Jiangxi's Agricultural Reclamation Business Moves Forward</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Nanchang, February 2nd Express News] Jiangxi is a part of the Poyang Plain and has always been known as the "Granary of Jiangnan." However, in the past ten years or so, it has suffered from banditry and enemy disasters. The once prosperous and constantly cultivated farmland now presents a desolate scene. According to a preliminary survey by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, there are more than 200,000 mu of reclaimed fallow land, accounting for almost one-third of the province's arable area. Although the provincial government has also been continuously supporting spring plowing and encouraging winter planting, due to manpower, fertilizer, and the poor rural economy, the figures for wasteland reclamation and increased production have been minimal over the years.</p>
<p>Mechanical agricultural reclamation is giving Jiangxi's barren rural areas a new force. They use very little manpower to obtain more harvests, pulling the declining rural areas onto the road of revival and increased production. Currently, the Jiangxi Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office is widely launching agricultural reclamation demonstration work and contract farming.</p>
<p>In the current stage of China's rural areas, everything is cultivated entirely by manpower and animal power. In order to promote mechanical cultivation and enable farmers to advance from the use of manpower and animal power to the use of machinery, the Agricultural Reclamation Office has adopted a stronghold approach to running Nanchang, De'an, Ruichang, and Shanggao.</p>
<p>Demonstration Farms</p>
<p>They use the wasteland all over the fields, use machinery to cultivate, so that the local people can recognize the effectiveness of machinery, and then use contract farming methods to engage in their own cultivation.</p>
<p>Shanggao Sixi Farm was the earliest place for mechanical cultivation in Jiangxi, and it began in October 1947. De'an, Nanchang, Ruichang and other farms, as well as the mechanical agricultural reclamation business in sixteen counties and cities throughout the province, were successively organized by the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office at the end of last year. At present, the area of wasteland reclaimed by their demonstration farms has reached 4,000 mu. Together with the past voluntary contract farming and the joint farm of the Dengjiabu Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the accumulated reclaimed wasteland is about 100,000 mu. However, the heavy rains during the spring and summer seasons this year affected the cultivation. The crops that had already been planted or were growing were mostly submerged by water or washed away. Therefore, the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office estimates that the summer harvest will suffer losses of 200 石 of sesame, 70 石 of melon seeds, 20 dan of cotton, and 40 石 of sorghum. A total of 434 mu of crops were submerged, resulting in a loss of over 8,400 yuan in production value. Currently, the staff of the demonstration farm have fully launched the</p>
<p>Winter Planting Campaign</p>
<p>They do not avoid difficulties or fear hardships in this new endeavor. Everyone is moving towards the overall goal of the business's success. This time, they planted 3,000 mu of wheat, 300 mu of oilseed rape, and 400 mu of broad beans. It is expected that in the first half of next year, they will harvest 4,500 石 of wheat, 200 石 of oilseed rape, and 200 石 of broad beans. The production income is estimated at 55,000 yuan at current market prices. The summer production volume next year is also expected to be above 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Contract farming and water pumping work have established work stations in Nanchang, De'an, and Ruichang, which are jointly managed by the demonstration farms in each location. Because they charge low fees, the local people all know to use mechanical contract farming, such as wasteland reclamation, sowing, harvesting, and even water pumping. Many drylands that were not originally intended to be cultivated have achieved yields one or two times higher than rice paddies this year due to the assistance of the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office's pumping stations. The people consider this an unexpected harvest, which further aroused their interest in using new machinery. Therefore, requests for</p>
<p>Contract Farming and Water Pumping Are Coming One After Another. The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office estimates that the area of contract farming in the first half of this year was 2075.6 mu, the area of contract harrowing was 8.29 mu, the drainage time was 5465 hours, and the irrigation area was 1437.9 mu.</p>
<p>Now, the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office plans to further expand from demonstration cultivation to "machinery going to the countryside" so that farmers in all areas can use new machinery for cultivation. Therefore, in addition to their "demonstration" and "contract farming" businesses, they are also promoting the distribution of agricultural machinery. According to Director Lin Fengchun, since the use of tractors and pumps, this business of distributing agricultural machinery has had a demonstration effect in Jiangxi, attracting the attention of the general farmers. Some farmers also want to purchase machinery, but</p>
<p>The Distribution Work Still Has Few Achievements. The reasons are: (1) the rural economy is declining, (2) farmers lack organization and are mostly small farmers. With the existing farmland system, the use of agricultural machinery is limited by terrain and management system.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office is now working on improving the mechanical planting methods in rural areas. On the one hand, it is expanding the existing demonstration farms, and at the same time, it is implementing installment payment methods to give farmers in a declining economy the opportunity to purchase agricultural machinery, and also accepts applications from farmers to provide opportunities to learn mechanical cultivation.</p>
<p>Although mechanical agricultural reclamation in Jiangxi has been in operation for less than a year, it has achieved considerable success through their hard work. We can see that the records in the "Sprouts" magazine on China's agricultural mechanization and the report of the previous inspection tour to Jiangxi by the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office both recognize that the Jiangxi Office's business, such as demonstration farms, contract farming, supply, and processing, have all been done well, which is clear evidence.</p>
<h3>Around the Time of the Fall of Shenyang: Surviving the Jaws of Death, Witnessing the Tragedy, Providing a Serious Lesson (Part 2)</h3>
<p>On the 29th, dense gunfire and artillery fire could be heard in the eastern and northern suburbs of Shenyang. On the morning of the 30th, it finally quieted down slightly. The reason for the silence was that the "front office" had already "written the article," meaning that the surrender had already begun. On the afternoons of the 29th and 30th, Wei Lihuang summoned Gao Xibing, Peng Jiqun, Wang Jiazhen of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, Wang Tiehan, chairman of Liaoning Province, and Dong Wenqi, mayor of Shenyang, to a meeting. Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang reported on the current situation. At the same time, news of the instability of the defending troops was constantly transmitted to this round-table conference. Everyone agreed that the overall situation was lost. Only then did several civil officials fully understand the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>Initially, the President sent a telegram ordering the resolute defense of Shenyang. During the meeting, Wei Lihuang and others received another telegram from the President, ordering them to lead senior civil and military officials to evacuate immediately. At 3 p.m., Wei only accompanied Zhao Jiaxiang, Gao Xibing, Wang Jiazhen, Wang Tiehan, Dong Wenqi, Peng Jiqun, and a few others, as well as Pan Yukun, commander of the New 1st Army, Wei Long Tianwu, and Wu Li, deputy commander of the Shenyang Air Force, who arrived later. In addition, there were Xu Liang, commander of the cavalry and chairman of Liaobei Province, and Hu Jiaji, commander of the Shenyang Garrison, who arrived later.</p>
<p>At the moment of boarding the plane, the scene was too tense and too tragic, because many officers and soldiers who had retreated from the front line were crowding in front of the plane, scrambling to board. The front row pushed against the back row, and the scene was a mess. Wei Lihuang climbed onto the plane, and Zhao Jiaxiang also boarded. Wang Jiazhen was passed in over the heads of the crowd. Dong Wenqi was pulled up from the side. Others, like Wang Tiehan, also got on. Zhang Jianfei, the Northeast Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pulled Mayor Dong's hand to get on board. Committee member Peng Jiqun was squeezed out of the plane and could not get on. As the plane took off, the ground was a scene of</p>
<p>yelling and shouting. This was the last plane to take off from Dongling.</p>
<p>What about Hunhe Airport? On the afternoon of the 30th, there were four planes parked there, said to be on a special mission. Outside the airport, there were civil servants who had purchased tickets two days before but were unable to fly. Then came batches of military personnel running over, covered in sweat, totaling about a hundred people.</p>
<p>Soon, all four planes, under the guise of "test flights," started their engines and took off empty, one after another. At that time, the people at the airport were disappointed and indignant, but who cared!</p>
<p>The reporter witnessed Ms. Zhu Lun, an executive of the Northeastern District Women's Association of the Central Party Headquarters, grabbing the jeep of an air force deputy commander, crying bitterly. She pointed to a young man standing beside her and said, "As his aunt, if I don't take Zheng Dongguo's young master away, I'll really feel sorry. You're all leaving, please think of a way for me!" The response was, "The situation has improved now. If we leave, we'll be letting the country down." After saying that, the jeep sped off to Dongta Airport, where it was said to have flown away with Wei Lihuang.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu Lun was left behind at the airport and could not leave. A woman chewing gum, requesting a ride, kept saying, "I am the wife of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Chen." But she also received no help. When the reporter left the airport in the evening, he still saw batches of military personnel rushing to the airport, hoping to escape the dangerous situation, but all their efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>On the 30th, in the afternoon and evening, the area around Shenyang was unusually quiet. Zhao Yi (Xijian), the Northeast District Director of the Ministry of National Defense Military Law, and Wang Huayi (who failed to board a plane while waiting in line at Dongta) who reluctantly came forward as a local figure, Lu Naigeng, the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, Xu Yangyang of the New 1st Army, and others, angered and disappointed, negotiated with the Communist side in a shop. It was heard that the main purpose of the negotiation was to spare the citizens of Shenyang from suffering, requesting the "Eighth Route Army" to postpone its entry and not to make Shenyang a battlefield.</p>
<p>On the 31st, there were no major changes in the suburbs, and the streets were extremely quiet. Only the military and civilians moving their homes back and forth showed some chaos, as if telling people that the situation was about to change drastically. At night, the stars filled the sky, and the earth was silent.</p>
<p>Before dawn on November 1st, a loud explosion was heard in the Tiexi District, followed by constant artillery and gunfire. The citizens were startled, thinking that the "peace talks" had broken down. Later, they learned that it was an ammunition depot that had exploded.</p>
<p>In the morning, planes disappeared from the sky. Chaotic gunfire was heard everywhere in the city. Soldiers with red silk strips on their upper pocket appeared on the streets, engaged in security. Many disintegrated officers and soldiers, carrying clothes, biscuits, and flour, were running around everywhere.</p>
<p>At noon, the gunfire subsided. Scattered bandits in ragged clothes, with hand grenades stuck in their waists and carrying large iron bars, appeared in the urban area. The disintegrated National Army soldiers were looking at these exhausted bandits in groups here and there. Later, teams of bandits arrived, wearing grass wreaths on their hats, stuck with messy grass. Soon, jeeps and trucks were speeding on the streets, confiscating firearms and weapons everywhere. Then,</p>
<p>the Korean Communists came and also entered the urban area, confiscating weapons and engaged in security. The "peace talks" ended without result. Zhao Yi and others went to Tieling on the afternoon of the 30th to negotiate with the bandits, but did not return. Zhou Fucheng, commander of the 53rd Army, Su Bingwen, chief consultant of the Northeast Suppression General Headquarters, and other personnel had already been placed under house arrest. In the meantime, some officers and soldiers of the 207th Division resisted and tried to break through, but unfortunately, it was all in vain.</p>
<p>In the evening, the air force flew from Beiping to Shenyang and dropped the first bomb. At night, every thirty to forty minutes, planes flew in to bomb, and flares lit up the city sky, continuing throughout the night. The bombing area was widespread.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, some poor people distributed the stored grain from several grain areas and demolished several houses. In the afternoon, the air force came again to bomb the Tiexi factories and the Dongguan arsenal. On the 3rd and 4th, they continued to bomb for two more days. At night, they sometimes flew in, and several ammunition depots were hit, constantly making explosions. Probably on the 7th, the bandits transported in anti-aircraft guns and began to fire at the air, but the bombing did not stop.</p>
<p>On the 3rd, the bandits established a "Military Control Committee" with Chen Yun, Wu Xiuquan, Tao Zhu, Zhang Xuesi, Wang Shoudao, Chen Bu, Zhu Qiwen, Chen Long and other eight people as members. Chen Yun served as the chairman, and Wu and Tao as the deputies. It was divided into four departments: finance, economy, logistics, and railways.</p>
<p>The Shenyang Garrison Command was changed to the "Garrison Headquarters," with Wu Xiuquan and Tao Zhu serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. Zhang Xuesi, chairman of the bandit Liaoning Province, arrived in Shenyang on the 5th to take office. Zhu Qiwen was the puppet mayor of Shenyang, with Jiao Ruoyu as the deputy mayor, Jia Shi as the puppet director of the Finance Bureau, Liu Xiangsan as the puppet director of the Industry Bureau, Zhu Jingzhi as the puppet director of the Commerce Bureau, Gan Chongdou as the puppet director of the Social Bureau, Wang Shiqing as the puppet director of the General Affairs Bureau, Jiang Feng as the puppet director of the Health Bureau, Shao Kai as the puppet director of the Education Bureau, He Xia as the puppet director of the Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Yunlong as the puppet director of the People's Court. All of them took their puppet positions.</p>
<p>The bandits were caught off guard by the occupation of Shenyang, so their political personnel arrived five or six days later than the troops. Formal activities began on November 10th. The district governments in the city were established on the 10th, and the</p>
<p>census began on the 15th. Meetings were held for the citizens every day, which annoyed them.</p>
<p>annoyed them.</p>
<p>Economically, the people suffered the most. First, it was stipulated that the gold yuan and circulating coupons should be stopped completely. Later, it was stipulated that they could be exchanged at a certain rate for ten days upon request.</p>
<p>At first, everyone sold things, exchanged money, and bought things. The grain carts from Kaiyuan and Siping came, and the price of sorghum did indeed drop, but the source of other goods and daily necessities disappeared, and the prices rose across the board, so life became more difficult.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's "Trade Bureau" was absorbing clothes and daily necessities. The people took things to exchange for grain and soybean oil. The "Trade Bureau" was making a lot of profit. The "Trade Bureau" was distributed in various districts, doing all possible business, purchasing, and transportation. There were large institutions everywhere, and large stores would be squeezed out. Large enterprises and businesses would be monopolized by the "Trade Bureau."</p>
<p>People with carts and horses mostly organized "production carts" to pull passengers and transport goods, enjoying protection and eating public grain. The profits were split in half. The bandits originally had no train or car transportation, and the production carts helped greatly. Although the transportation situation has changed greatly, such production rubber-wheeled carts are still running on various highways and stations.</p>
<p>The Northeast affair was handled so badly, and the losses were so terrible. Everyone is responsible, especially from the time of the takeover to this disastrous defeat. We should settle the old scores and find out the truth. This is a major settlement and a major lesson. If we shy away from treatment for fear of the disease, is there any way out?</p>

<h3>Communism in China (5)</h3>
<p>The competition between the Nationalists and Communists for control of the Northeast, which began shortly after Japan's surrender, eventually evolved into open civil war. By the second half of 1946, the Communist Party had gradually gained confidence in its own strength, while also increasingly believing that the United States would cease supporting the Nationalist Party, at least temporarily. In the Communist areas, the Communist propaganda's fundamental attitude had a strong anti-American bias from the beginning. On June 20, 1946, this propaganda policy was extended to non-Communist areas. This day can be considered the day the second civil war extended from the Northeast to mainland China. On that day, the Soviet radio station and Chinese newspapers in Shanghai launched an anti-American propaganda campaign. This event immediately followed the Communist Party's military offensive in Shandong. For the first time, the Executive Headquarters, which had been cooperating between the Nationalists and Communists, experienced an open rift in parts of China outside the Northeast. Following this, Mao Zedong openly demanded that the United States cease all aid to the Nationalist government and withdraw its troops stationed in China.</p>
<p>Following the start of the propaganda campaign in Shanghai newspapers, on June 23, the same day Mao Zedong issued his statement, processions and demonstrations followed, with an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 participants. This unrest developed into the "U.S. Troops Get Out of China Week" movement, which took place in the last week of June.</p>
<p>The propaganda policy at this time aimed to emphasize that the Communist Party desired peace, while the United States did not, and Marshall's efforts were disregarded. Propagandists claimed that the mission of American troops stationed in China, such as repatriating Japanese soldiers, had long been completed, and there was no need to remain in China any longer.</p>
<p>Propagandists went further, denouncing the United States as an aggressor nation in Asia and the successor to Japanese imperialism, calling upon government troops to unite and resist the United States with the same spirit as they had resisted Japan in the past. Popular propaganda stated that American imperialism was more cunning and formal than Japanese imperialism, because the United States was more powerful than Japan, making American imperialism even more dangerous and frightening.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's propaganda consisted of a set of stale anti-American arguments: the United States selling surplus goods was called imperialistic; American imports were seen as competing with domestic products; the U.S. discussing civil aviation agreements was considered a prelude to controlling air transport rights; traffic accidents caused by Americans indicated the carelessness of American soldiers, and the failure to prosecute these cases according to the law indicated the Nationalist government's slavish attitude towards foreigners. Of course, any American news that could be exploited was exaggerated and sensationalized, including reports and rumors of American strikes, and the remarks of American politicians who were dissatisfied with the Nationalist government. Although the lynching of black people had been largely abolished at that time, it was still emphasized in propaganda. Newspapers in the areas occupied by the Nationalist government also seized upon the major theme of Communist anti-American propaganda and promoted it heavily. Cartoons published in "liberal" newspapers depicted "Uncle Sam" as a puppeteer, or taking advantage of the chaos, or hoarding goods for profit in the Chinese market, or seeking imperialist interests through commercial treaties.</p>
<p>This is the true face of the Communist Party's propaganda in China; its mission is not to convert the populace to Communism—that is the mission of the Red Army. The purpose of propaganda is only to confuse people and weaken the will and confidence of the people in non-Communist areas.</p>
<p>As for turning any part of non-Communist areas into part of Communist areas, that is a military task, supported by the techniques of economic and political warfare. Some call this tactic sociological warfare because it integrates economics, psychology, politics, finance, and other factors into one.</p>
<p>After the Communist Party occupies an area, it usually establishes a temporary military organization, mobilizing the local lower classes to rob the homes of residents and wealthy people who have already fled. They also set up a "People's Court" to try anyone suspected of causing trouble. They implement forced conscription. They issue new currency, recall the currency issued by the Nationalist government, and use exchange rates to destroy the people's savings, eliminating classes of rich and poor.</p>
<p>The propaganda methods used in the past to oppose Japan's support of Chinese puppet governments and warlords are now being used against the United States' support of the Nationalist government, which has become a puppet of the United States.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the propaganda shows that the Chinese people are peace-loving, and the CCP is also peace-loving. If it were not for the American conspiracy to support its puppet Chiang Kai-shek, there would be no civil war. All peace-loving Chinese people should unite to support the peace-loving Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have not forgotten the Nationalist government's contributions to the war against Japan, and their attitude towards the Nationalist government would not have changed suddenly, but their belief was diminished by the condemnation of the United States. At that time, Chiang was only attacked as a puppet and dupe of American policy. The Chinese people were very clear in their minds: it was the Communist Party, not the Nationalist government, that broke the truce agreement and restarted the civil war. Blaming the outbreak of the civil war on an American conspiracy made it seem reasonable that the Communist Party was not the real instigator of the war.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that many Chinese people had some contact with Americans, and most Americans had a good impression, the Communist propagandists did not encounter much difficulty. They divided Americans into two categories: one category was the friendly Americans and American leftists, and the other category was everyone else. These second category Americans were all classified as fascist imperialists.</p>
<p>People's Courts vary according to local conditions, but generally lack legal regulations or evidence, relying on mob rule to accuse people of any crime, and arbitrarily pronounce sentences. The Communist Party's trials and death sentences of foreign Christian missionaries proved the Communist Party's contempt for religion.</p>
<p>Between 1945 and 1946, incidents of Communist Party interference in church activities occurred one after another, including robbery, fines, shootings, public executions, as well as arrests and disappearances. UNRRA service personnel were often stopped, sniped at, or placed under police surveillance. At the same time, Communist propaganda demanded that UNRRA increase its aid to Communist areas, and UNRRA medicines were continuously transported to Communist military hospitals.</p>
<p>All these tactics completely destroyed the economic system. But this does not hinder Communism, because the Communist Party does not need to provide for cities it does not occupy, nor does it need to seek markets in the "enemy" areas beyond its borders. But it does weaken the Nationalist government's strength everywhere. Before seizing all political power, the Communist Party was willing to let the country collapse, and had various ways to promote this situation. In any area where its control is not yet stable, the Communist Party has no motivation to engage in economic construction.</p>
<p>The military aspect of Communism surpasses other factors in the Communist Party's organization, as can be seen in other areas and outside of China. The regular troops of the Chinese Red Army give observers the best impression. In the rapidly growing recent years, its discipline and morale have declined compared to the past, but the Red Army's administration in newly recovered areas is probably better than later civil administration facilities. Its senior officers are mostly capable and have many years of guerrilla warfare experience. Its junior officers are mediocre, and the soldiers are mostly ordinary conscripts, no different from the soldiers of any Chinese army in the past. Its policy of avoiding combat is really most suitable for the tastes of undisciplined elements who only want to loot.</p>
<p>The CCP's organization emphasized the scenario of civil war activities. The CCP's highest governing body is the Central Executive Committee, composed of 44 members and 33 alternate members. Among the executive committee members, 12 are soldiers, and among the alternate members, at least 5 are soldiers. The Central Executive Committee is usually run by two smaller groups—the Political Bureau and the Military Commission—to carry out party affairs. The Political Bureau, composed of eight members, is the CCP's real executive committee, and the Military Commission is composed of six members. Four people serve as members of both groups, and Mao Zedong serves as chairman of both the Bureau and the Commission. Therefore, the basic division of the highest organ of the Communist government is between military and civilian affairs, with close cooperation between the two, only the authority of the civil officials is slightly higher.</p>
<p>The administrative departments of the Communist Party's central government are directly under the Central Executive Committee, and are responsible for propaganda, education, economy, finance, and other functions. The CCP's administration is more decentralized than centralized. In lower-level administrative organs, the division of military and civil authority is extremely even, almost entirely depending on individual circumstances. An army commander can be the head of a locality, and a political commissar can also be the head of another locality, all depending on their courage, ambition, and personal talent.</p>
<p>To summarize the actions of the Chinese Communist Party after the Japanese surrender, we may as well reiterate the situation during the American-led peace talks. The CCP broke the January 10 truce agreement and began advancing into the Northeast in early spring, and advanced into Shandong in July. They besieged Yongnian, Hebei, for a year. At the end of this year, Communist commander Zhu De exaggerated that they had annihilated 45 brigades of Nationalist troops. The Nationalist government's reports stated that when the truce began, the Communist army only controlled 60 counties, but by the end of the truce, it had expanded to 300 counties. During this period, it is said that the two sides continuously held formal negotiations in order to establish a truce agreement and achieve a comprehensive solution.</p>
<p>C. The Changing Direction of World Communism</p>
<p>Since the end of the wars against Germany and Japan, world communism has begun to change direction. This is another major shift in Communist Party policy that is consistent with Leninist doctrine. Since the first major shift in 1921 from the policy of war communism to the so-called New Economic Policy, this is the sixth shift. Obviously, we must consider this shift in world communist strategy.</p>
<p>In his writings, Mao Zedong believed that the situation in China must be viewed in many ways in relation to the world situation. The development of the situation in China after the Russian Revolution was not the same as before. In 1930 and during the war, China's political problems were echoing the situation in Europe and other parts of the world. This is not only Mao Zedong's view, but also the standard view of the general Communist Party.</p>
<p>Therefore, we may as well assume that the major changes in the world situation over the past three years must be reflected in the changing direction of Chinese communism, although the new direction has not yet been fully clarified. The "New Democracy" policy applied to China is, after all, the same period as the cooperation of the wartime allies, and it is also an extension of the "People's Front" doctrine that originated in Europe in 1936. "New Democracy" was adopted by several countries in Eastern Europe between 1945 and 1946. They established governments that allowed the Communist Party to occupy important positions in the cabinet, and used these governments to maintain their unshakable advantage. In this way, the future goal of "New Democracy" immediately became the current reality, canceling all pretexts for democratic style and coordination between parties, and transforming the question of how to seize power into the question of how to use it after seizing power. This change, simply put, is that the Communist Party's gaining power in several countries has become an important point in the world trend of transitioning from the compromise and cooperation between wartime communism and democratic countries to the "Cold War."</p>
<p>The basic mode of operation of the Communist Party after seizing power is most clearly demonstrated in the history of the Soviet Union itself. The major problems encountered by the Communist Party after gaining power in an industrially backward country are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The speed of industrial development necessary to expand the potential for war in future international struggles.</p>
<p>2. The speed of capital accumulation necessary for this industrial development.</p>
<p>3. The speed of agricultural collectivization necessary to reduce agricultural labor and expand industrial labor.</p>
<p>4. Determining the most appropriate timing for the transition from decentralization of the United Front to the exclusive power of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>5. Determining the most appropriate timing for the gradual decline of Communism from overemphasizing patriotic sentiments.</p>
<p>6. Determining the most appropriate timing for the Communist Party to carry out purges and restore a strong united front party to replace the scattered parties of "New Democracy."</p>
<p>7. The division of various classes and parties other than the Communist Party.</p>
<p>8. Determining the most appropriate timing for incorporating new Communist areas into Soviet territory.</p>
<p>The problem of communism in the past three years can be said to be the re-departure of communism to cope with the above-mentioned problems. But even if these problems are handled as urgent tasks, the "New Democracy" strategy cannot be applied again. Therefore, this re-departure of communism requires changing organizations, readjusting the connections between other groups, changing some Communist Party leaders, and changing policies and strategies.</p>
<p>Since the efforts to try to form a coalition cabinet that accommodated the Communist Party failed, the opportunity for "New Democracy" to be applied to China ended. But the Chinese Communist Party can endure this change. Since 1944, the CCP's strength has gradually increased. It adopted a new policy and did not encounter any serious problems, because the Chinese civil war was in full swing and had not yet reached a decisive stage. If the CCP wins the Chinese civil war, it will inevitably cause the most serious internal policy problems for the Communist Party in Eastern Europe, as well as the question of China's mission to promote communism in Asia. But the CCP will be able to find ways to deal with these problems when they arise.</p>
<p>D. The Debate in the United States on the China Problem</p>
<p>For the United States, the China problem is a problem of assistance. Since the Japanese surrender, the United States has had extensive discussions on this issue. The problem is certainly difficult to solve. Just looking at the protracted debate and the inability to reach a satisfactory conclusion, one can imagine how thorny this problem is. When the Foreign Affairs Committee met in February and March of this year to discuss the Foreign Aid Act of 1948, the reasons held by the proponents and opponents were stated in detail. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Those who advocate that the United States should not aid China before China has laid the foundation for domestic unity and peace hold the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. If peace can be achieved, international war and large-scale civil war can certainly be avoided.</p>
<p>2. If peace can be achieved, all parties and factions in China can certainly unite and cooperate to lay the foundation for a democratic republic.</p>
<p>3. Whatever aid the United States gives to China, the Soviet Union will certainly take relative actions, and the two sides will enter into competitive intervention.</p>
<p>4. Outsider countries should not interfere in China's civil war.</p>
<p>5. If outsider countries interfere in the civil war, they are infringing upon the right of the people to self-determination.</p>
<p>6. The Nationalist government organization is not sound and is corrupt. If the United States gives it aid, this aid will certainly be wasted.</p>
<p>7. In the past few years, the United States and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have given China a lot of aid, which has not had any effect.</p>
<p>8. If we give China sufficient aid, it will eventually become a large and difficult to handle permanent burden for us.</p>
<p>9. Chinese communism is an economic reform movement that is sound and powerful.</p>
<p>10. "New Democracy" is a liberal and democratic program.</p>
<p>11. Questions about the importance of Chinese independence to U.S. security must not be included in the United Nations' world peace plan.</p>
<p>12. China's territory is too large, and aid is unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>13. To maintain the goodwill of the Chinese people for a long time, only a non-intervention policy can be adopted. If we interfere in China's affairs, even if we do not have to bear the responsibility for the civil war, we will have to bear the responsibility for prolonging the war in the minds of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>As for those who advocate that the United States should aid China, they hold the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. Communism is not simply economic reform, but also a power politics with an unprecedented level of expertise.</p>
<p>2. If one country does not interfere in the civil war on the one hand but interferes in the civil war on the other, it still cannot preserve the country's right to self-determination.</p>
<p>3. The Soviet Union skillfully and on a large scale interfered in China's civil war.</p>
<p>4. China has suffered from more than 20 years of civil war and international war, and the Chinese organization behind the Nationalist government is fragile and corrupt. (To be continued)</p>
