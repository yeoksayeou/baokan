<h3>社論　吸收僑資與生產事業</h3>
<p>自幣制改革以來，其良好現象之一，爲僑滙的激劇增加。其中有兩大主因：一爲出口的活動，一爲滙率的合理，而尤以後者最爲重要。因爲滙價偏高，出口商太不合算，終不得不出於隱匿走私的一途，這可以拿過　幾年的事實作瞪明的</p>
<p>政府爲避免是項資金大量地逃避起見，曾於本年七月二十七日由行政院公佈僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業辦法凡十一條，其目的自在開闢途徑，使停留在國外或橫溢　其他地區的外滙資金，得以重返於國內。而無如條件太苛，限制太嚴，在擁有僑滙的僑商　在積有在外資金的存戶，與禾託代辦輸入物品的進口商，均以重重束縛，裏足不前，施行一月，至八月十九日是經濟改革之時止　是項辦法。實際上可稱紙上談兵，一無效果。這固由於時日太侷促，一般關係人或未及着手準備，而其所指定的用途，係限於農林漁牧工礦水利公用交通等事業，其創辦新事業或擴充舊事業，又須具備種種條件，且其申請輸入之生產器材，規定必須確爲申請人自用，其輸入原料時，除限定必須自用外，其數量並不得超過六個月生產所需要，如有遠反，則申請人或其委託代辦之進口商，均須受永久停配原料限額與永久不得申請任何物品之處分。此等嚴密的拘束與罰則，實在過於繁苛，未免令人望而生畏，還有什麼興趣來與辦事業？何以故？擁有是項外資的人，對於前述種種生產事業，未必具有深切的興趣和經騐，如果確定僑商，已積有相當資金，其人又必出國日久，於國內的經濟情形未必十分熟悉，自更難切其欣然來歸。所以這項辦法，與其說是吸引外滙，倒不如說是限制外滙的內流，較爲貼切。古人所說「南轅北轍」，就是爲這類辦法寫照的。</p>
<p>自財政經　緊急處分令頒佈以後，因爲同時公佈中華民國人民存放國外外滙資產登記管理辦法，今昔情形不同，所稱僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業辦法，聞已在主管機關修訂之中，且以國人在外資金。已有登記管理辦法爲之範疇，所餘下來的問題，只是僑資一項，其範圍已相當狹小。其扼要之點。聞爲（二）如何證明是僑滙，（二）其投資生產事業時，須有國內相關機關核准的生產計　（見廿八日本報）。前者的用意，蓋在防止不是華僑的國人在外資金的冒濫，而後者則顯在加强生產事業的拘束，以免流入非生產事業。就事論事，這也不能不說是應有的措施。不過對於本問題的處理，有兩個要點，不能不特別舉出來，要求當局的注意：</p>
<p>第一，僑資也罷，國人在外資金也罷，我們的最大目標，總應該是要它流回來，不是屏除它，使它繼續停留在國外。這理由很簡單明瞭，似乎用不着再加以申說·因此、一切的辦法，只許指導它，幫助它，多方開關門戶來吸引它　使它易於流入，以期儘量地加以利用：斷不宜多費手續，增加種種不必要的麻煩，以阻其內向之路。自從經濟改革以來，國內金鈔的收兌，成續斐然，爲國家增加不少的資金：而國外的外滙資產，其登記管理，迄今尙待推動，可知國外資金的吸收，與國內金鈔的收兌，其難易逈然不同。近來有關方面，爲維持國內的生產起見，頗有開放自備外滙的傳說，其大要爲准許購辦原料或器材入口，而不附以設廠自用等等條件，這比投資國內生產事業申請輸入辦法的規定，要近情，要進步得多了。在上項辦法修訂的時候，我們很盼望，把這種意思趕快採納進去。</p>
<p>第二，所謂生產事業，在上項辦法第一條，雖把農產加工，出口事業，及手工業，統通並列在內，但照其他二·三·四各條條文看來，其意義顯然偏重在設立工廠。工廠從事生產，自無疑問；但如果沒有人把原料器材等等販來備用，則從事生產之工廠，安能予取予求，隨心所欲？所生產的成品，如果沒有批發，販運，門售等商人來代爲推銷，其生產的任務，是否便算終了？其他金融運輸等業，好像不過是普通商業，與生產事業均無直接關係，但離開了這類事業，大規模的生產事業，又是否能圓滑地進行？所以引導僑資來舉辦生產事業，雖然是一個動聽的口號，但我們應當把這「生產事業」四個大字作廣義解釋，不可刻舟求劍　嚴格地限於辦廠。而且工廠的規模，大小不同，如果都一定要責令他們自辦原料，自辦器材，乃至自行推銷，那是事實上所萬萬不許可的。假使如此，則祗要一個「工」字好了，何、必還留一個「商」字呢？</p>
<p>我們以爲國外的資金，不論是屬於僑查，或是國人在外存款，與其留在國外，任人利用，終不如導引回來，由我自用之爲愈。有許多定貨，因爲不合輸入條款老是留在國外，不得進口，或已進口而重新運出，停留在香港或非列濱等處？這些定貨，如果不是奢侈品，遠禁品，我們也主張趕快從寬許其進口，以期充實物資，安定民生。這些事，目前不可再事猶豫拖宕的了。因爲物資不過是資金的另一方式，而資金的終極效用，也脫不了換取物資。所以吸引僑資，登記資產，與許可定貨進口，其作用原是一樣的。</p>

<p>換發整理公債之外幣債劵，計有四種，凡在卅七年八月廿日以後到期，應還之本金，運同最近一期息票（息金算至九月卅日止）一併換發民國卅七年整理公債，惟整理公債値票尙未印就，經規定先行辦理登記手續，持票人應持同債息票及印章，赴就近之經理銀行（亦係四行一局）申請登記，將原持有之外幣債劵繳存銀行，掣取臨時收據，俟債票印妥，再行憑據換領債票。</p>
<p>以上法幣公債淸償及外幣似券換票登記期限，均至明年三月底截止，逾期未請淸償或登記換票者，其所持債票一律作廢。又各債在卅七年八月十九日以前業已到期之償票息票，均應由持票人照從前原定償付辦法，另持向經理銀行兌付本息，不在上項加倍淸償及掉換新債之列。</p>

<h3>國際管制原子能問題　政委會展開辯論　加請聯大採納美國計劃　維辛斯基今日提出答覆</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三十日電〕聯合國政治委員會昨日下午第一次開會，決定下列六項首先置入議程。（一）原子能委會之報吿；（二）蘇聯裁軍建議；（三）巴勒斯坦事件；（四）希臘事件；（五）韓國問題；（六）　殖民地問題；豫料此六項將需六七星期始能討論完竣，此後政委會將再開會議，決定其他應需討論之項目。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎三十日電〕聯大政治委員會三十日開會考慮蘇代表維辛斯基所提一取締原子彈及五强縮軍三分之一」兩項建議，加拿大原子彈專家麥克諾頓演說稱：世界上僅有美國擁有足够之原子彈，力能發動原子戰。麥氏又贊揚美國之國際管制原子能計劃，並稱，蘇聯之計劃無確切之保障。渠稱，「蘇聯計劃所規定之管制，僅在大事削减美國之軍事力量，蓋美國為唯一擁有原子彈之國家，至少為唯一具有足够發動原子戰力量之國家」。渠稱，希望聯大辯論能產生一種基礎，使東西兩方原子能管制之談判能吿恢復。渠乃動議要求聯大通過美國之原子能管制計劃，且督促聯合國全部會員國接受美國計劃，作為國際管制計劃發展之某礎。麥氏稱，大衆悉知原子彈存在於世界上，其力足以毁滅文化，渠警吿稱，新分裂物質之發現，新型炸彈之發展，及其他發展過程上之新發現，使今後之原子彈遠較日本所遭逼者為酷烈。麥氏審愼之措詞，不一筆抹殺蘇聯亦有原子彈之可能，然毫無疑慮表示在數量之質量上，美國可脾睨全世界。麥克諾頓稱，用於日本之原子彈乃「雛型」品，其中僅發出「少量」之核子力。又稱，目前效率已「大有增進」，更稱，「此一方面之可能性，或可以移動一位小數點表示之」。美代表奧斯汀將原子管制之遲遲無進展，歸罪蘇聯，蓋蘇聯之計劃僅取締原子能，而未規定有效之國際管制，「由於蘇聯堅持其主權在全體之安全及生存之上，故恐懼已代希望而起。吾人必須羣策羣力，俾將原子發現起死回生，唯有以國際保證使原子能之應用，不用於毀壞方面，吾人始有長期安全之可言」。奧氏果斷宣稱，「美國目前仍願將其原子發展之獨佔附帶安全保證，置於國際控制之下。奧氏演說後，委會中發生長時間程序辯論，其他各委員對加拿大動議均不願發言。主席史巴克正擬宣佈一般辯論終了，維辛斯基突表反對。渠稱，加代表動議甫於卅日晨傳佈，故渠不擬迅速發言，會議延期至十月一日重開，屆時蘇聯可望提出答覆。按多氏之動議要求聯大通過原子能管制委會之報吿及建議，其中包括美國之管制計劃，並「號召全體國家接受本會所通過之管制根據，而負起對世界人類之責任」。序言承認如世界欲在原子時代中求生存，則在原子問題上「除各國自動互享主權外，別無他途可循」。</p>

<p>杜爾斯承認因蘇聯對柏林實施陸上封鎖而引起之問題，由聯合國于此時加以處理，實屬一重大負担。渠謂，柏林問題之存在，誠屬一極大遺憾，惟此一問題旣屬存在，國際之和平與安全旣已臨重大考驗，則任何可能尋求解決之途徑，不應置之不予嘗試。聯合國不僅為有條不紊處理局勢之適當塲所，抑日為國際上唯一塲所。不論此項工作對于聯合國可能具有若何冒險之性質，但縱使此等冒險確屬存在，維護和平與正義之努力，仍屬至高無上最關重要者。和平決不能在不冒任何危險之情形下而吿獲致者。論及安理會之工作時，杜爾斯認為其最大功能，厥為和平解決爭端，並謂在和平解決爭端方面，大國之否決權應自動予以停止使用。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京卅日電〕此間若千日本人仕三十日預測，組閣七閱月之　田內閣，可能因內　閣員一人涉及日本「戰後最大之貪汚案」而辭職。在日本最大之肥料製造商昭和公司向日本復與銀行貸款之大盒汚案中，經濟安定本部長官栗栖涉及重大嫌疑，東京地方檢察署已準備對栗栖下逮捕令，但將延遲至傳詢後開始行動。</p>
<p>栗栖在貸款時正担任復興銀行總裁。其他因本案而被捕之內閣各部主要官員，已達二十五人。內閣發言人則力斥內閣正考慮辭職之謠傳。渠稱：內閣「絕對信任」栗栖。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京卅日電〕日首相產田三十日因栗栖被傳訊，乃於正午招致鈴木法相，苫米地會議後，發表談話稱：「曾聽取鈴木總裁之報吿，對於栗栖並非逮捕而係傳訊，內閣可不必立卽表明態度，卽亦無於三十日召開閣議之必要，今後靜觀事態之推移再決定政府之動向，以此栗栖國務相之後任問題，亦不必預為解決」。</p>

<p>又稱：韓政府與美國密切合作，將力爭「多國」之友誼，並担負朝鮮之國際義務。李氏稱：朝鮮之基本國策，為「締造力能維護人民福利，保持國家威信之民主國家，傳之萬世而不窮。大韓民國為一完全主權必要之國家，決不獎勵個人或集團之特權」。渠並宣佈已成立「國防局」，作為行政計劃之一環。李氏稱，大韓民國遵照盟國之義務，「獲得大多數盟國之支持」，而成立「為人深信主張公理和平之國家，必依中美菲之例而承認我國。」渠希望韓國能參加聯合國，要求參與對日和會，並保留要求日本給予「合法」賠償。</p>

<h3>蘇聯政府要員更動　加強組織推進計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿九日電〕史達林於離莫斯科休假前，改組蘇政府，加强其組織以防嚴冬。此可於月來蘇政府要人之逐漸更选看出，然因過程緩慢，故外界一時不易發覺。最重要者恐係鐵道交通部之改組，史達林以貝特希夫調長該部代替柯伐勒夫，同時並任命新次長四人，顯示該部之成績不佳。然鐵道人事之更張尙不足以使蘇聯政局專家驚駭，蓋咸知鐵道為五年計劃中之要衝。更進一層，由於國際局勢日緊，史達林有意整頓鐵路。另一要事為克魯鐵柯夫之出任蘇中央政府副總理。按副總理多人組成內層內閣，各負一部政務或經濟之專職而調度常務部長之工作，例如安得萊夫之監視農業，喀雪金之於財政及貝利亞之獨掌原子硏究。克魯鐵柯夫原任對外貿易次長，故渠殆將管轄對外貿易，然對外貿易部長朱柯揚亦兼副總理，故兩人如何分權頗成疑問。</p>

<p>王孝和係上海電力公司職員任電力工會常務理事，因企圖破壞本電力，唆使吳國楨等將鐵屑摻入電機地軸內，企圖使機器爆炸，造成黑暗世界，以圖達其擾亂治安之目的，事發經警備司令部予以逮捕。特種刑庭判處死刑本月廿四日中央特種刑庭覆判仍處極刑。昨日上午九時許，特庭將王犯自隆昌路看守所中提出執行。王年廿五歲，身體健壯，頭髮紛亂，着舊條子襯衫，藍布工裝褲，黑布鞋，態度至為倔强，雙手反銬。九時三刻朱誠檢察官升座後，提王到案，騐明正身，吿以今日奉令執行。問其有無遺言。王當庭申述三點：（一）社會局因謀奪取電力工會，用此手段，（二）警備部非刑逼供，（三）特刑庭不許辯護律師出庭，秘密審判。並大呼：「死得寃枉，特刑庭亂殺人！」庭上詢其對家屬有無遺言，渠稱要見家屬，不寫遺書。勸其喝酒，以减少痛苦，渠僅呷一口，稱不會喝酒。至此，朱檢察官飭將王犯押赴刑塲。自法庭至刑塲一段路中，王猶在呼謾駡不已。當行刑時，因王身體左右擺動不止，遂將其綁於椅上，由保警二中隊機槍總隊班長葉耀鵬執行，一彈由後腦進，自左頰出，鬆綁後仆於地上，猶口張心動，再補兩槍，始告畢命。時上午十時卅分正。</p>
<p>聲請三點　覆判駁斥</p>
<p>又中央特刑庭覆判書。關於王孝和部份，除詳述王糾衆陰謀破壞電機經過外，並曾對聲請人等之聲請覆判要旨三點，卽（一）未通知其選任辯護人出庭辯護，秘密審判，顯係違背法令。（二）聲請人在警備大隊部所具之自白書及供述，均出自刑求。（三）放置粗鐵層於電機地軸中，絕不致爆炸，不能發生犯罪結果，依法應减輕或免除其刑云云，分別予以駁斥。其原文稱：「本庭查違反戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例之罪者，其案件之審理，依同條例第十條規定，僅得許辯護人員出庭辯護，幷非採用强制辯護，原審對聲請人選任之辯護人，未准其出庭辯護，自非違法。</p>
<p>社局證明　確未用刑</p>
<p>（二）查警備大隊部偵訊本案時，係會同社會局專員范才睽辦理，據該專員在原審到庭證明，當時會同審理，確未用刑。（三）據工程師王斐雲在原審稱：「鐵屑太粗，不易滲入，如細屑可能立卽爆炸，時間稍長，組鐵屑可變為細鐵屑，一定爆炸。」是聲請人所謂放置粗鐵屑不能發生犯罪結果，顯不足取，聲請人意旨均無可採。」結論認為「王孝和主使張世寳供應鐵屑，交由吳國楨放入電機地軸内，窺其用意，以為電流停止，上海成為黑暗，地方發生混亂，藉以策應共匪，使政府顚覆，其心可誅，其情絕無可原。」</p>

<h3>當局決發動　物資總檢查　同一期內檢查一種　以防物資隱匿逃避</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣經國於昨日上午十一時，假央行會議室召開第九次經濟檢查會議，出席委員張師，程義寬，林崇墉，兪季虞等。會中議決推行今後之經管工作，首須舉辦日用必需品之調查統計，故決於日內發動物資總檢查，在同一時期內檢查同一種物資，以防其隱匿逃避，此項工作預定在三日內完成。為預防擾民起見，將訂立統一檢查規定，檢查工作人員將一律頒發證章，以資識別。蔣督導員昨日在會議席上鄭重表示：中央決定不顧一切困難，貫澈旣定政策，同時計劃全國各區配合，以平抑物價。一個月來，穩定物價之工作，已有相當基礎，今後須努力者尙多，希同人加緊工作。又此次兌換金鈔之踴躍，足以表示人民對政府之信仰，本人深為感動，惟多數大戶，尙未能全部兌出其握有之金銀外幣，有需我人繼續努力使渠等能舉其所有貢獻國家。</p>

<h3>協助政府推行財經措施　實現民生主義社會運動　王昇招待新聞記者再度說明　戡建大隊靑年服務總隊任務</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕蔣經國的幹部戡建大隊，正如蔣經國本人一樣，在今日許多上海人心目中，似乎已視為傳奇性的「英雄」，實際上，蔣督導員僅是一個平凡的有勇氣有正義感的人民公僕，他的幹部戡建大隊同樣地也是一支平凡的憑着正義為人民工作的隊伍。他們的活動，固然使奸商顫慄，豪門喪胆，但他們並不是三頭六臂，殺氣騰騰的人物。</p>
<p>戡建大隊成立以來還不過一年多的時間。當三十六年初，當局痛感各綏靖區的軍民脫節，保甲腐敗，匪諜充斥，覺得必須培養一批新的人才來協助接近戰區地域的基層行政。於是元首手諭在中訓團之下，開辦一戡建班，並成立訓練委員會督成其事，主任委負是張厲生氏，副主任委員就是蔣經國，實際負訓練任務的則是蔣氏智（二）團之一的幹校副敎育長黃埔三期畢業生胡軌，他就是現在戡建大隊的總隊長。</p>
<p>並不直接檢查捕人</p>
<p>原來在唐山的第六大隊調滬迄今，已有月餘，但各界對於該隊的性質與任務，觀念仍極糢糊，甚至有人以為他們是無所不宣的特殊人物。大隊長王昇為此昨大特招待新聞界，他鄭電地再度聲明：戡建大隊的任務非常單純，卽是「發動人民，協助政府，推行財經緊急處分令。」戡建大隊本身並非衙門，絕對不負直接執行檢查或捕人的任務，換言之，戡雞大隊在這種任務上必定配合軍警，在軍警機關的指揮下處於協助地位。根據大隊長的報吿，該除一月來的工作成續如下；（一）設立人民服務站十四處，接受密吿案件計一，八七一件，其中抬高物價者百分之三十六，囤積居奇百分之十五，偸運物資百分之一·六，金鈔買賣百分之三，房屋糾紛百分之一·五，政治性密吿百分之二·八，貪汚密吿百分之二·五，建議百分之四·五，其他百分之二十六。所有這些密吿信重大者送呈蔣督導員，普通的交給經濟警察辦理。戡建大除本身除非遇到特別複雜的案子才從旁協助調查。</p>
<p>協助參加經檢工作</p>
<p>（二）舉行人民談話會，在設立人民服務站之各區內每保分別舉行，廣泛探求民隱，市民參加者極為踴躍，一般意見均主張對奸商予以最嚴厲的處置，希望戡建大隊長期駐滬，對黃牛黨及中間商的居間剝削均深感痛恨。戡建大隊將這些老百姓的意見轉達當局，於是有大規模捕捉黃牛黨之舉，今後對於取締中間商的剝削仍將積極執行。（三）協助經濟警察，參加經濟檢查，共派隊員一中隊，混合分配於各經濟警察大隊中。一月來計執行非法抬價案五百件，囤積居奇案一百件，黑市案一百件，地下錢莊案十一件，買賣金鈔案五十一件，逃避外匯案二十一件。（四）參加市區內軍警憲組織之檢查站工作，每站派一人，兩路局檢查站則派七人參加。（五）派隊員一中隊赴無錫，配合當地行政當局，執行與上海同樣之任務，一月來計破獲中央藥房囤積案，大名紗廠囤積案，林良寳物資資匪案，利新生煤油公司囤積案等重要案件多起。</p>
<p>匿名密告不予採用</p>
<p>戡建隊的工作一切依據法理，並無神秘之處，但因社會一般人不十分明瞭，就造成若千歹徒冒用戡建隊員的名義，實施敲詐或橫行不法，有些愚昧的商人受了騙且還不敢聲張。該隊已查獲四次冒名累詐之事，把贓款追獲後交還給原主時，這些習慣於上海社會風氣的商人們，竟會目瞪目呆的認為是天大的「奇跡」，因此大隊長再三的籲請市民注意，凡是戡建隊員出動檢查或搜捕時，一定配合軍警，並有隨身證件，否則就是冒充，可報吿該隊或治安機關加以拘辦。此外該隊人民服務站所接的密吿信中有許多並未具名，經調查後竟有百分之四十是誣吿，故今後對不具名之密吿信祗能作為參考，不予採用。密吿信中被吿的姓名，地址，事實應該詳細叙述，密吿信應投送各人民服務站或函寄申字七〇〇九號郵政信箱，切勿誤投他處。</p>
<p>決不讓惡勢力猖獗</p>
<p>同樣地，最近成立的大上海靑年服務總隊，也是一個並非特殊階級，並非執行機構，並無權利，完全義務，為國家為人民的組織。該隊的所以成立，據兼總隊長王昇報告：一是響應總統訓詞中「人民應首動起來協助政府」的號召，一是團結本地的正義力量，以永久保障不讓惡勢力猖獗。</p>
<p>靑年服務總隊的隊員程度百分之十二是專科以上，百分之四十五中學，百分之二十五小學，百分之十八其他。隊員原有的職業百分之五十六工商，百分之二十四學生，百分之三自由職業，百分之十七其他。總隊的組織共分二十個大隊，下轄一百個中隊，每一中隊有三個分隊，每一分隊分成三小組，每小組有隊員十人至十五人不等·靑年服務總隊不久將開始的工作是協助政府人力的不够，例如大規模檢查倉庫等。在工作時，他們受政府的指揮，每人有臂章為憑，工作完畢後立刻收回。所以他們的行動亦是配合軍警的集體行動，不應該有一人或少數人單獨的苛擾。</p>
<p>不合格者將予淘汰</p>
<p>有人懷疑靑年服務總隊人數衆多，份子複雜，難免有流弊發生。王總隊長昨天報吿說，靑年服務總隊人數雖多，他的幹部人數亦多，平均每人控制三十多個靑年隊員，相信不良份子決難逃過他幹部的手。同時，當現在靑年隊員受入隊訓練時，他正在進行考核，在十月三日以前可將不合奢淘汰完畢，十月三日以後始確定為正式隊員，此後並將縱續予以小組訓練，不僅是政治性的訓練，且將給予進修學問的機會，使成為開始社會革命運動轉移社會風氣的中堅份子。</p>
<p>總之，王總隊長綜合起來說，靑年服務總隊的成立，決不在政治上或爭權奪利上有任何作用，參加靑年服務總隊的隊員應該都是無產者，有財產的應捐給國家。靑年服務總隊的主要工作是實現民生主義的社會運動。</p>

<h3>閩西龍岩無烟煤</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　陳曉風</p>
<p>〔本報厦門廿五日航訊〕龍岩的位置是處於閩西中心，成為福建西都的大鎭，因為它出產了無烟煤，許多人對它的印象並不十分生疏，連來因為國內戰事未已，上海感到煤的來源困難，曾有不少滬商來岩勘察煤贓，並將岩煤運滬試用，可是迄今尙無下文，但我們相信，滬方實業界若能與政府合資經營，大量前來開採運銷，龍岩的煤確有它光明的前途。</p>
<p>龍岩所蘊藏的煤多數是無烟煤，依據、</p>
<p>地質分析　龍岩的無烟煤是屬於二疊紀的，夾於砂岩頁岩之中，約厚半公尺至二公尺不等，但龍岩究竟蘊藏煤量若干，因未經科學援器的探測，至目前止還沒有一個眞確的數字。依據閩省府戰前的測量的報吿，全縣的煤量約有二千七百五十五萬噸，最近根據建設廳技正陳啓發赴岩勘測的結果，估計全縣的煤量約在三萬噸以上，然而，這些統計的數字，都無法包括龍岩整個煤區，故正確的數量仍無法決定。</p>
<p>調查報告　全縣煤田分佈的地區與數量大約如下：在附城的新羅區，蝦公山南延至塔山後，約長二公里，由翠屛山之東經東寳山之北延至鐵石洋，約長七公里，這些地區蘊藏的煤量，約為一千三百七十萬噸</p>
<p>岩東北區　　　至雁石的雁石嶺為中心，約長五公里，估計有中級無烟煤四百五十六萬噸。雁石鎭蘇邦村煤田約二公里，約有煤量二百七十萬噸，雁石鎭，大吉村，水龍潭一帶，煤區五公里，約計三百六十四萬噸。白沙鎭，可遠亭煤區週圍二公里，煤層厚一，六公尺，數量估計有五百八十萬噸。其他如美和鄉，蘇坂村，集美山以及雲潭之南等地區，估計煤量約三百萬噸。</p>
<p>岩南煤區　白土鎭，肖坑，些岡鄕船巷以及申溪蔣邦之東，曹運鄕王莊一帶，估計有二百多萬噸，適中鎭西之寳田約有一百多萬噸。</p>
<p>岩西煤區龍門之東約長三公里，共有三百卅四萬噸，銅江之東南及小池一帶有一百多萬噸，依照以上各區的估計，則全縣煤量總數係在四千萬噸之上，在福建全省煤藏一億五千三百萬噸中，龍岩的煤量約佔四分之一强。</p>
<p>化學分皙　煤硪中以無烟煤為優，含碳百分之九十四，氯百分之二·五。但龍岩的煤經人化驗，確是最好的白烟煤，含有碳百分之六十四至八十六，發揮質百分之三·二至五·五，含灰質百分之五至廿五，據各方化驗結果，全縣煤區中，以龍門鎭內坂村九龍山的煤最好，其碳質約在百分之九十以上，質堅色黑，有如龍鱗反光，火力甚强，堪稱高級無烟煤，次者如新羅區的煤含碳質達百分之九十二，白沙的煤含碳百分之七十五，匯石的含百分之八十二，均為不可多得的煤。據一般用煤的住戶意見，認為無烟煤含水分甚少運輸便利，而且含　甚微，儲藏安全，灰質亦少，不致减少熟量或閉塞火門，發揮質不多，適合家庭炊事及冬季取暖之用。在工業上說，無烟煤可供輪船運輸及工廠發電，如能煉成焦煤，則用途更廣。龍岩的煤質，各方均認為甚佳，若能用科學方法開採，在工業上實有無限的希望。</p>
<p>由於交通不便，重要工業迄未建立，龍岩的煤，目前還是靠着全縣三百名礦工用鋤耙等工具，換嘗之，僅用人力挖掘每年出產三萬五千噸左右，供全縣家庭炊事以及少數燒炭之用。</p>
<p>至於探勘煤礦，目前還沒有採用探鑽機一類的機器，他們差不多均憑過去的經驗，利用原始時代的鋤頭，探測礦内內項層及兩壁情形，或加木柱搭架主持，進行開採工作。在今日建設華南聲中，這工作實已急不容緩。</p>
<h3>株洲鐵機廠巡禮</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員黃潮如</p>
<p>〔本報湘潭廿六日訊〕湖南湘潭的株洲，本是一個不為大家注視的小鄉鎭，自從粤漢路通車，這裏是中心站，浙贛路和湘黔路均以此為終點，於是她的身價陡漲十倍，由於地理環境的優美，中央老早就計劃將株洲作為工業區，戰前就有不少規模宏大的工廠在此籌備，後來均因戰事影響中途停頓，勝利三年後的今日，這裏又積極恢復建廠工作。目前較大規模的有永利化學工廠，兵工廠。鐵路機廠等，而此三廠復建的進度，永利尙祗全力用在建造水塔工程上，兵工廠也不過建起了幾棟房子，只有鐵機廠稍有一點規模，雖然距離全部工程的完成還遙遠得很，但已有部分在開工，所以外界人士到株洲參觀，鐵機廠是唯一的目標。記者此次隨同長沙記者團，沿浙贛路訪問。第一日到株洲，未作片刻休息，就原車駛進機廠，作了兩小的巡禮。</p>
<p>籌建經過機廠不在株洲附近，位於北三公里的田心車站旁，民國廿五年就開始籌建工作，到了廿七年春初步完成，該廠是準備將來製造機車的，但廠址建成時，尙僅承修粤漢浙贛兩路機車車輛。不料正在計劃繼續擴建中，日寇突然發動侵華戰事，不久戰火漫延湘北，株廠慘遭擊炸，在四次長沙會戰中，敵踪曾數度竄到株洲，此一新興工廠，經過戰火的洗禮，完全摧毁無遣了。等到抗戰勝利，當年鋼骨水泥的建築，僅機車。機器二工塲尙幸存鋼架，餘悉變成瓦礫，蔓草荒烟。</p>
<p>復廠工程復廠工程始於三十五年八月，計分兩期進行：第一期為修理廠時期，第二期始能達成製造機車。現在正是第一期工程進行中，預定計劃於本年底完成修理廠，現在廠房建築，已完成者有機車塲，機器塲，臨時鑄工塲，臨時鍜工塲，臨時機器塲，臨時動力塲，車輛塲，材料庫，辦公室等，正在興工建築中者有鑄工塲，白石港發電所，機車機器塲擴建部分等。據該廠報吿，年內均可完工。機器方面的安裝情形，國內調撥之機器三十餘都均已安裝，聯總機器已運抵關內者，分由上海。九龍輾轉運廠，已運到二百餘部，安裝者約百餘部，餘正繼續整裝中。動力裝置，七百五十瓩蒸汽發電機已部份運到，現已興建廠房，準備輸電電桿，年內設備運齊，當可完成供電設備。目前該廠動力，暫賴七十五瓩柴油發電機供給。該廠工塲部份的職工，現在已增到二百餘人。</p>
<p>株廠前途國內規模較大的鐵機廠，華北因為匪亂的影響，都難發揮它的效力，長江以南，除戚墅堰一處外，就首推株州廠了，而且株廠是後成立的，各種機器是國內鐵機廠中最新式的，將來它在國內所擔負的使命將是最重大的，尤其株州地處湘江之濱，粤漢浙贛湘黔諸諸路之交點，東達浙滬，南通港粤，北為濱湖魚米之鄉，隔江為下攝司，有資委會計劃電力中心地，鋼鐵取諸大冶，煤焦仰賴萍鄕，湘地的人力亦不感缺乏，徵諸地利，則適處我國中南區重工業中心，於將來發展，未可限量。我國機車，向賴國外輪入，我們願見株州能有一天駛出自造機車，行駛各路！</p>
<h3>新舊報紙在香港　兩種勢力正展開劇戰中</h3>
<p>— 于紹中</p>
<p>〔香港廿七日航訊〕香港，這英國紳士們一向所珍視為英皇冠免上的一顆寳石，是一個美麗動人的地帶，現在，它又是我們國內的許多冒險者的樂園，不論是政治的，經濟的，文化的部門，都在展開着五光十色與劇烈戰鬥的塲面。事實上，這島上各種不同報紙的存在，顯示着鬥爭的劇烈，在這一張一張的報紙上，每天都在不斷的展開着新與舊的衝突，左與右的衝突，民主與極權的衝突。</p>
<p>說到香港的新聞界，不能忘了代表目前國內兩種勢力的兩家報紙，國民日報與華商報，前者係抗戰初起時國民黨在海外的同志所主辦，出版已歷有年所，滬上文化界名流如陶百川·陳訓悆。王新命諸氏都曾為該報負責人，或主持筆政，現任所長為老報人潘公弼氏，這一家具有歷史的海外唯一黨報，自去年起，已改為公司組織，艱苦撑持，而其立塲依然站在國民黨思想鬥爭的最前綫，同時，他可是香港各報中最富民族觀念的一個，屢次為了僑胞利益與英國政府作義正辭嚴的爭辯，對僑胞的印象頗深。華商報為共產黨的機關報，最初猶以民間立塲相號召，後來面目被人揭穿，索性以毛澤東代言人自居，大吹大擂起來。以前其編輯經理兩部的負責人為薩空了和劉思慕，近來已經改調原在新加坡辦報被逐到港的邵宗漢主持改版至今，依然如故，其形勢大有岌岌不可終日之槪。</p>
<p>在報壇上，政治的宣傳氣味比較淡的是星島，華僑，工商三家。這三家也是當地報紙中較右歷史的，其中篇幅最多銷路最大的要算華僑，其次是星島，為胡文虎氏星系報紙最傑出的代表報，篇幅較多，在閩·粤各省擁有相當的讀者羣，工商報是香港爵坤何東氏所創辦，立論亦頗嚴正，反映香港當地工商界的呼聲最多</p>
<p>本年度出版的兩家大報，就是大公報和文匯報，大公報的內容跟該報上海版差不多，似尙有不斷改進的傾向·文匯報依然是老作風，向共產黨的懷抱一相情願的倒下去，而在技術上則反而較為稚　了些，無論是新聞，副刊，都不知不覺走上貿色的道路，也許是為了迎合香港離味吧！</p>
<p>此外，在香港市面上，還有許多佔有相當發行量的，是一些莼粹黃色新聞的日報，晚報，他們遺是停滯在色情，武俠的階段上，這些已是國內任何一個地方報壇上找不到的現象·他們經常以廣東方言行文記事，在小市民們（包括工人婦女等，）却引為茶餘飯後所不可缺少的「精神糧食」·至於生活在半山區，與友邦朋友相來往的高等華人們，在用早茶或下午茶的時候，都是以一份英文早報或晚報作消遣，也許他們對中文的欣賞和前面所說的小市民一樣，是習慣於「如要停車，乃可在此」這一類「香港地一的」華文的範　裏面。</p>

<h3>吳化文盲目投匪後　在蚌房產予沒收</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　錢夢超</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿四日訊〕在山東長淸附近參加濟南外團戰之前陸軍整編第八十四師師長吳化文，此次在前方突然叛變，消息傳來，此間各界人士特別注意。綠吳於敵偽盤踞蚌埠期間，曾任偽第三方面軍總司令，實力雄厚，駐蚌甚久，皖省鉅奸，幾無不與吳相識，一時聲勢顯赫，頗遭敵人忌憚。吳去歲固守兗州，因作戰努力，頗著功績，深為中央所倚重，且有擢升為暫編某某軍之擬議。此次裹脅一部份官兵盲目投匪，殊出一般人意料之外</p>
<p>吳之老父吳一齊，住蚌甚久，老態龍錢，與記者有一面之綠。吳化文在敵偽期間，　有大馬路天橋南張姓房產，佔地二畝許，吳一齋與其長女（卽吳化文之胞姊）等，常住寓內，旬日前，吳派人來蚌，言其母在濟南患病，旋接其老父往濟南同住。詎未逾半月，吳卽以叛變聞，不知其父母在濟南事先遷移否。今吳旣被通緝，其在蚌之房產，最近期間自將予以沒收，其寓所一部份為吳之棉戚借住，一部份為駐軍佔用。</p>
<p>吳現年僅四十六歲，早年以高小畢業生投至馮王祥部下當兵，旋以隨營學校學兵被保送保定軍校畢業，曾任韓復集部手槍旅旅長，為人善變，具有馮韓之傳統作風，其副師長榻團一，原係吳之參謀長，追隨吳多年，現年六十八歲，為前淸秀才出身。</p>
<h3>蘇北棉產喜訊</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　叢永樞</p>
<p>〔本報南通廿四日訊〕密邇江南紡織工業地區的蘇北，正是一片廣大的綿產區，記者懷着欣喜的情緒來報導：「蘇北的棉產量今年又增加了」！</p>
<p>據精確的估計今年蘇北綿產量約一百二十萬担左右，較去年增加二十萬担以上。產區分布的情形大致是：南通三十八萬五千餘担，海門十四萬五千餘祖，啓東十萬零四千餘担，阜寗十三萬八千餘担，鹽城四萬一千餘担，東台二十一萬九千餘担，興化一萬四千餘担，如皋十一萬六千餘担。統計植棉面積達四百十四萬六千畝，差不多佔江蘇全省植棉面積百分之五十五。（據農林部棉產改進諮詢會曁全國紡織業聯合會聯合公布的本年棉田估計，江蘇省計七百五十九萬四千畝），但這個數目還不能包括整個蘇北棉田。蘇北的東半，就叫蘇東吧，（江蘇軍管區設在這裏的師管區稱蘇東師管區）是產綿的中心地區’尤其是濱海一帶的鹽墾區，幾乎完全是一片棉田。為了明瞭這一帶面積數字，一直翻到民初的調查報吿：南從長江起，北到漣水陳家港，西起范公堤，向東直到海濱，南北長五百里，東西闊約二百里，面積約一萬一千方公里，合一千六百五十四萬畝地。沿海一带，海水逐漸東退，灘地向東伸展，新淤之地也就年有增加，最快每年可漲出一·六公里，如果把三十多年來的新漲灘地也算進，這一片墾地至少該有二千萬畝。其中已墾的不足半數，成熟的棉田又僅約已墾土地一半强一點，約計五百六十六萬畝以上，這就不是一個小數目了。我們知道，蘇北農村先後遭受了敵偽的蹂躪，繼之又備受匪軍破壞，現在，正在從匪氛裏逐漸甦醒過來，這顯然是一種進步。</p>
<p>蘇北棉產區大，土壞亦有殊異，所以棉種也就非常複雜。大致鹽墾地區宜於種植美棉而沿江一帶則適宜植中綿。棉種不同，棉花纖維的長度也就相差甚多，長的有十六分之十三英寸，短的只有二分之一英寸。遇去在這一帶播種的「脫」字美棉，今天已撕毁了金字招脾，給牠新換一個名稱叫「退化洋棉」。這種美棉起初很受農民歡迎，可是，十數年來，管理不善，栽培不得法，再加與中綿混雜，致使品質退北，　維長度僅十六分之十三英寸，衣分只有百分之三十一。卽一百斤籽綿僅可軋成三十一斤皮棉。</p>
<h3>雞榖祁門收租惡例</h3>
<p>佃戶籲請取締</p>
<p>〔本報徽州廿七日訊〕「鷄榖」，是祁門田主種下的一個惡習，據佃戶說：創作的人，是從前城中西街某姓勢家大族，過去曾出過不少的大人物，產業上的積置，自然是很豐厚，也是當時祁邑數一數二的一個大地主。每年秋收的時候，它的子孫，都下鄉向佃農去監收租穀，佃戶為了種它的田，總要殺鷄奉酒的款待，一點也不敢怠慢。主人看見佃戶家飼鷄鴨，不禁顯生羨心，佃戶為了博取主子的歡愉，不得不送一二隻給主子帶回去，這麼一來，便成了一個慣例了。每年到秋收監租，照例向佃戶索鷄。遇着佃戶家裏沒有養鷄時，又怕開罪於主子，只得以榖代替鷄値。相沿成習，遂開監租帶收「鷄榖」的惡例了。</p>
<p>近年某姓門庭，雖然破落，但是對佃戶的鷄穀，還是要的。其他田主依例索取鷄穀的，亦不在少數。現邑中三里街保王人言等已投函徽報，為佃戶呼籲，希望當局趕緊破除封建餘毒，解放佃農。鄕間有識佃農，亦將繼起聯名請求縣府嚴厲取締，期使這種惡例不再流毒於民間。</p>

<h3>產地價高販戶裹足　食米交易寥落　雜糧貨稀價昂油市上升</h3>
<p>食米交易，寥寥無幾，因產區價高，販戶都已裹足，到貨稀少，昨日南市到五七七石五斗，北市為五二三石，是以供應極少，市塲所報價格，大都未做開，南市塲開紅糙秈二百二十石，連袋價十七元，其他開出均少，北市交易慘淡，與南市相同，市塲樣檯上無米樣，同業散市頗早。</p>
<p>麵粉交易仍儂頓中，因原料小賣貨幾絕，祇能維持配粉，不能供應市塲，批發商皆無貨供應，麩皮廠方無供，又無配貨，交易完全停頓。</p>
<p>雜糧堅昻而無貨，致交易益趨冷落，黃豆售額寥寥，向隅者頗多。苞米不易多購，紅糧無人賣出，待議價核准而估善價。元麥成交後不覆樣，趨勢俏利。菉豆，蠶豆，均不露面，芝蔴高俏次疲，生仁稍有開出。</p>
<p>食油綏緩上升，趨勢穩健，豆油廠方日有所供，昨有大統廠開五一·四〇，中植五一·〇〇，現貨大都五十一元，故上漲一元多。生菜油大德新廠貨高價昂，以限優開出，熱菜油無多榮辱，蔴油平，生油站限價，豆餅竟無供應，初次無交易。</p>
<h3>祁紅銷路旺盛</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，祁門紅茶及屯綠等，輸出商買氣依然四溢，但執主仍以產區毛茶步堅，心思莫不跟挺，且大都不願輕脫，是以交易續吿狹隘，形勢則更穩固。</p>
<p>茲據業中人云，近因海外需茶奇殷，故茶商能度異常樂觀，惜本年產量並不豐富，致出口恐難轉暢，而預測前途，尙有迭吐秀氣之勢，至於內銷茶，授受勻衡，卒乏軒輕。</p>
<h3>糖市續挺</h3>
<p>食糖昨日爾內又有開放出境之說，更因台糖公司本期配價稱有增高，於是人心重趨俏利，而業內銀根鬆濫，多單無用者，亦多扒吸，市呈堅俏。二十期台赤棧單，開後卽見挺秀，中間迂迴盤旋，收市略見升騰。興化赤因吐售較多，納胃銳减，市氣稍軟外，其餘均見挺秀。</p>
<h3>廣州限制匯款</h3>

<h3>透支過額退票　截留依法究辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金管局頃奉財部釋示；凡行莊客戶所開支票，經票據交換所發現係因存款不足透支過度而致退票者，應卽截留由行莊依法向法院檢舉究辦，並由行莊負提供證件之責。如行莊提供證件向金管局呈報者，亦可由該局逕移法院究辦。至客戶因到貨愆期或次貨充數而發生之退票，得由行莊解釋，准予免受停止往來之制裁一點，如行莊能提供客戶止付之確切證件，經該局審核屬實，自可酌免制裁。金管局為此已分令銀錢信託三業及票據交換所，一併遵行。</p>
<h3>提前淸償公債　今日開始兌付</h3>

<h3>美援棉三萬包　即可運廠供用</h3>

<h3>棉紗普登漲限　布疋價格昨賡續上揚</h3>
<p>昨日綿紗市况晨開平庸，旋以各方納意仍股，市上銀根依然鬆濫，業內頭寸寬裕，在塲見賣卽進。上日申新廠開售之紗，申購一空，塲內買氣旺盛。十六支紗籌碼缺乏。昨永安廠開售者僅十支嘉禾，卅二支金城，四十二支金城，四十二支雙股金城，六十支雙股金城。紡建公司亦開二十支紅魁星。紅雙鷄。彩魁星。翔鳳。五子九獅等牌，共計七百件，價仍為七百元。全日趨勢各檔細紗供售甚稀，複製業搜購孔亟，價登限盤。廿一支雙馬紗仍售七百八十三元，限度成交。二十支紗供求相埒，十六支平定，十支粗紗走勢不惡，價均達限度。</p>
<p>昨日綿布市况，價格賡續上揚，市呈求過於供。十二磅龍頭細布開盤微挫一角，旋步砌至廿八元六角高盤，其餘各布亦都漲近限度。嗣經該業公會董理事長當衆發表談話，謂：「棉布登記手續已辦理完畢，但今後不論買進賣出，一律必須申請，以防物資逃避，根絕投機操縱」。並勸同業勿僅以龍頭細布及四君子元嗶嘰為交易對象。旋各理事在號拋售龍頭細布及四君子元嗶嘰四百餘疋，市勢方吿平穩。最後龍頭細布以廿八元結束，比上日步升四角。龍頭B字·五福喇叭童及四君子元嗶嘰等，則互有一角至三四角之上落，惟色布士林布仍平定，塲內買風濃厚，吐售不多，雖有紡建公司開售，市仍挺秀，全日成交一千二百疋，</p>
<p>棉布登記完竣</p>
<p>又訊：棉布登記，昨已照期辦竣，計布一·四六五·二六七疋，五二一·〇八三段，又一七五·五〇八碼，二·四〇二公尺，一六·一六二磅，及被單八三九條，約合疋額二百萬疋，已於　是備文彙呈社會局，</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會各民營紗廠舉辦聯合配紗，昨為第四期第二次，連上次共開出棉紗二。五〇件。又自九月廿七日起至昨日止，四日來各廠分別自行開售紗布，彙報總額共計折合廿支紗一三八五件，棉布五三二〇〇疋。</p>
<p>棉市准予落</p>
<p>現棉因限價交易，鮮有做開，緣產區來源無形中止，同業交易不進不出，市况冷落，交易淸稀，周浦籽花仍照限價，少有成交，其除有價無貨。</p>
<h3>人絲堅俏</h3>
<p>人絲昨市交易仍冷，惟因禁止携帶出境，本街門銷略見减色，但存底稀薄，業中人心甚緊。更以市上銀根鬆濫，晚貨售現者甚少，趨勢平中帶堅，交易形成僵持，市况轉呆，雜牌依限略有零星成交。</p>

<h3>崇明民本中學</h3>
<p>新校長視事大加刷新</p>
<p>〔本報崇明訊〕崇明和上海相距咫尺，城裏商舖很多，然工業中心却在縣城東五十里的一個小鎭上——南堡鎭。而小鎭的南梢，有一所陶鑄人才的敎育機構，這就是崇明人盡知的民本中學。民本創於民國十四年間，迄今已二十餘年，過去成績卓著。抗戰軍興，學校在地方淪陷時，屋舍校具節會遭敵偽破壞，非大加刷新，決不能奏前效。今夏校董會延聘周匯瀟長校，敎師亦經過嚴格的簡選，一切都在革新中進行。現全校計八級，共有學生三百餘人。校景也很秀麗，向南的一排樓房都是敎室，前面有長方形的校園，園西是一條淸溪，兩岸夾着高柳和梧桐。橋西一排樓房是敎員職員和學生的宿舍。民本中學的師生便在此環境幽靜的校中認眞敎學，開拓該校的前途·</p>
<h3>中國敎育學會　募款籌建會所</h3>

<h3>滬江開學前後</h3>
<p>因病休學女倍於男　新人踴躍桌少生多</p>
<p>滬大註册後防癆工作展開，集體檢查的結果，在六百多個舊生中，四十餘位女同學和二十餘位男同學肺部不正常，占同學總數百分之十，至少需要休養一個適當的時期，方能復學。而筆試錄取的新生中，其比例也恰為百分之十。</p>
<p>本來學校設備都只適宜於六七百人左右，戰後復員以來，勉強容納千人。本學期註册學生共一二七九人。於是，宿舍中的房間和牀舖大感不敷，甚至有數十人羣居一室，席地而臥。膳堂的桌椅也吿缺乏，單論男生膳堂已少二十餘桌，其他課室和禮堂中的座位也生了問題。</p>
<p>可是在「建設滬江」的大原則下，新女生宿舍和湛恩紀念圖書館都已加工建造，在四十二屆校慶（十一月八日）時卽可同時竣工。由濬浦局負責塡築的濱浦江邊的十六畝新地，經月餘的冲積後，業已完成，校方正在設計佈置，俾使地盡其用。</p>
<p>在課程方面，本學期新設打字速記兩科，四十架最新的Royal打字機已由美國運到。</p>
<p>在學校行政方面，因耿訓導長辭職，改組為訓導委員會，並兼理助獎學金事務，本學期撥出助學金（由學費收入項下支付），計金圓六千九百元，速同市政府統一獎金，受助學生為二百人左右</p>
<p>敎職員薪金最高者為金圓一百八十元，最低者為金圓六十六元，均較前為高，全部共需金圓六萬六千元，由收入學費抵付，此後生活安定，他們對研究敎學當試有成績了。（忠祈）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談辦移交</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>各機關辦報銷的荒唐不合理與作偽的手法，前兩天東方君曾經談述。機關的辦報銷，是每月一次。而機關新舊的交接，它的黑幕也不少，因看到東方君所談辦報銷，我也夾談談辦移交</p>
<p>一個機機的長官，為了升調免撤職等，便要辦移交了。在舊式機關的經費，多是包辦式，如前淸的縣衙門，當縣知事離任的移交，只有印信和一些檔案卷宗而已，其他如辦公椅桌文具等，都是帶走，或拍賣或取價轉讓給後任。有些且把爐灶窗門等也從事破壞，使後任的要重新修理。而有關特殊案件的卷宗，也常藏匿不肯移交。錢糧土地的淸册，也弄得亂七八糟，故接收的人如不是內行，容易上當。因為在新舊任交接之後，例有新舊任聯名會報上級機關交接淸楚。這樣一來，雖然後來發現有不盡不實的卷宗表册款項等也無從再追，只得日認晦氣，設法彌縫罷了。</p>
<p>機關的辦移交，快的要十天八天，遲的要十個月八個月，也不奇怪。而辦交代的職員，有是本機關的現職人員，有的是隨同離任的人員，有的是被遺散的人員，就天天在那裏埋頭埋腦辦理報銷般來辦理移交淸册了。</p>
<p>一個機關將要辦移交之前，除了辦理人事的要編造職員公役和所屬的職工名單之外，最忙碌的是總務·會計·出綿·與管理器材的人員。在大都市的大機關辦移交是一套手法，內地的小機關辦移交又是一套手法。但是無論怎樣，多是舞弊。如公家的物件，採取狸猫換太子手段，用舊的換新的，用壞的換好的，這是最普通的一回事了。比如電風扇，脚踏車，打字機，沙發椅，甚至汽車，他們都可以用最破爛的舊物來調換機關裏日常所用新的好的，其他如寫字　椅桌文具等，更不必談了。從前某甲在北政府卸任總長後十年來所用的信紙信封，還是印有某部的名稱。信紙信封，尙且大事藏匿，其他文物，也可以推想了。</p>
<p>辦移交的去職長官，必定預用印信蓋就了空白的公事箋紙數十份，準備後來的應用。這些預蓋印信的箋紙，有時且可賣錢，如某人需要證件，他可以隨時塡發。有了皇皇的正式印信，誰敢說個不字。這一種玩兒，是辦理移交最重要的一件事，卽使廉潔的長官，對於預蓋印信的箋紙，也要有這一着，準備將　萬一的需要的。</p>
<p>辦移交的要內行，辦接收的也要內行，要是被此都是外行，或一方是外行，那就外行的吃虧的程度，不是什麽文字可以形容。弄得不好，小則賠累，中則被查辦，重的且有生命危險。一言以蔽之，是雙方弄把戲，看誰的技巧純熟，彌縫妥貼而已。這就是做官，這就是老公事。</p>
<h3>避蚊色</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>蚊子似乎有辨別顏色的能力。如果你穿的衣服的顏色是黑，藍，或紅，那麼蚊蟲們一定會蠭擁而來，把你的鮮血作為它們的美饌，因為，昆蟲學家發現：蚊蟲是特別喜歡這幾種顏色的</p>
<p>蚊蟲最不喜歡的顏色，是白和黃。你如果要避免蚊蟲的騷擾，最好就穿白和黃的衣服。</p>
<p>這些話並非毫無根據的空論。在美國喔里岡州蚊子最多的地方，科學家曾作過謹愼的試驗。他們呌七個人，穿着七種不同顏色的衣服，專供蚊蟲辦攻，昆蟲學家就在旁靜心觀察。在半分鐘內，飛集在黑衣服上的蚊子有一千四百九十九隻，而同一時期內白衣服上却祗有五百二千隻蚊子</p>
<h3>心理作用</h3>
<p>— 斐宇</p>
<p>變態心理學中有所謂「先存狀態」。我們通常所說的「心理作用」完全都是由「先存狀態」所造成。我們以為自己在頭痛，結果頭眞的痛起來了。我們在走路的時候一想到自己已走了幾十里路，身體已疲倦到極點，自己的脚就重得提不起來，路也再不能走了。總之，祗要我們有了一個固執的錯誤觀念，我們的行動往往會受到它的影饗。</p>
<p>有許多殘廢都是由「先存狀態」所造成。有一個老婦人自以為患了半身麻木症，她的左半身在她淸醒的時候完全麻木，是一些知覺都沒有的。但是當她睡着的時候，別人在她左半身扭一下。她立刻就會說：「蠶貨，你弄痛我了。」由此可見她左半身的感覺並未失去。後來有一個心理學家想了許多方法，把她這自信半身麻木的觀念打破，地左半身的感覺也就恢復了。</p>
<p>下面的一個例子可算是最奇怪的了。一個本有夢行病的靑年軍官在受傷後因患半身不遂症而退伍。他的下半身是一些不能行動的。一天晚上，他作了一個夢，夢見他的岳母要來搶奪他的兒子。於是他在夢中跳下床，抱起床上的枕頭當作他的兒子，奔出了他的臥室。家裏的人被他驚醒，急忙起來追他。那知他竟跑得極怏，一下子就跑到屋外天井裏，再綠着一根自來水管，爬上了三層樓的屋頂，手裏還抱着那個枕頭。別人却爬不上去，祗好從屋後樓梯上去攔着把他喊醒。那知他一醒之後，立刻丢了枕頭，跌在地下，於是他的下半身又不能行動了。</p>
<h3>雲深處近句</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>與　維叔範散木諸子有中秋西湖看月之約。而鵷翁以公返京，於髯以疾滯滬，始終實散木與偕，雜句記程。</p>
<p>廿載前頭憶此行，車中山色接臨平，刦餘生事渾無恙，入眼禾麻系我情。（車中口占）</p>

<h3>求醫記</h3>
<p>— 虹</p>
<p>發了幾天燒，看看情形嚴重，硬挺長挺不下去了，祗得揀了一家敎會醫院去求醫，為了這醫院可以少化些錢。</p>
<p>醫院在星期日是停診的，這大概是上帝的意旨：禮拜天應當休息，不許工作。所以大夫停止工作，　護停土工作，病魔當然也得停止工作</p>
<p>挨到星期「上午，雇了一輛人力車上醫院。到了醫院門口，只見鐵門緊閉，門外等着不少病人。站着的也有，坐在水門汀上的也有。大門前縣着的牌子上寫着門診是九點到十一點，而現在祗有八點鐘。</p>
<p>我站不住了，祗得坐在水門汀上。秋風吹得法國梧桐簌簌的響，帶來的寒冷一直透進骨里。</p>
<p>八點半，鐵門終於開了，病人們一窩蜂地搶先跑進去。到了掛號室，我排在隊伍後面，人却在一次一次的想嘔吐，頭發暈。</p>
<p>掛號「是一位看護小姐。我猜想一定還是個老處女，削骨臉，瘦瘦的身材，傲慢的目光。她高高在上的坐着，審問着病人。冷酷的語氣，一肚子不高興似的。</p>
<p>「姓什麽？」老處女在問口供。</p>
<p>「姓……姓王……」鄉下人結結巴巴地說。</p>
<p>「幾歲？」</p>
<p>「四……四十五歲。」</p>
<p>「你看的什麼科？」</p>
<p>「什麼果？我不知道。」</p>
<p>「你自己要看什麼科都不知道！倒底是內科還是外科？」</p>
<p>鄉下人這一下弄得目瞪口呆，老處女更怒氣冲天，尖銳的喉嚨斥責着：</p>
<p>「問儂呀，外人！」</p>
<p>幸虧這個鄕下人後面的那個病人來解了圍，問了這鄉下人哪里不舒服之後，於是恭恭敬敬地報吿了老處女。</p>
<p>着了這付嘲人的陣仗兒，等輪到我的時候，我忙乖乖的自動報上姓名年齡，以及所要看的是「內科」，總算沒有挨駡。</p>
<p>過了半個鐘頭我被喚進診療室，大夫以兩分鐘高速度的閃電診斷替我處了方，拿了這處方到藥局軋戶口米似的軋到一瓶藥水。</p>
<p>窮人骨頭倒底賤，這麽一下子我的病居然好了。大槪這是聖母瑪麗亞所行的神蹟吧。</p>
<p>亞門！</p>
<h3>雪學肉苓</h3>
<p>歷屆軍閥太半不得其死，如張作霖死於日人之炸，孫傳芳死於施女士之槍；張宗昌被鄭小將所狙擊，徐樹錚為陸承武所截殺，皆手槍送終。此輩云云，殺人多矣！而炸彈槍把又是他們平素習用之物，所謂玩水者死於水，玩火者死於火，原不足為奇。惟馮玉祥之死於火化，且在外國的旅行輪上電影塲中，却又非常別致。友人談及馮氏昔握兵符，殺人每不用常刑，如十六年在豫將附奉軍長田惟勤「活埋」斃命，卽其一例·「活埋」與「火燒」都是非法刑，生番及大盜，異端，村愚之仇殺，每每用之。馮死之奇，因果家其以為報應乎。</p>
<p>電火非比常火，輪船非比陸地，旣已起火，何以止死馮氏一人？（此外條傳一女同盡，然亦不近事理。）此輪於燒馮之後，何又安然前駛抵於敖港？異哉此火，專為送「基督將軍升天」乎？又聞馮氏喜自弄電影，而技術生疏，失手起火。然歟否歟？末由徵實。且其所乘乃「老蘇」之船，老蘇原是個神秘的國家，橫演「生死之謎」，一九四五，德國敗亡，希特勒下落不明，有種種疑生疑死之說，皆起於蘇將之一再否認希魔之死。又如溥儀之虜往彼國何用？寄押何處？優待或虐待？其說不一。是眞善於「捉迷藏」戲者。</p>

<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 29th] The International Monetary Fund informed the United Press on the 29th that there is a strong sentiment among members of the organization that a mission should be sent to China to investigate whether there are further measures that could be taken to help China resolve its monetary difficulties.</p>

<h3>Four Units Including Ministry of Finance; Plan to Draft Self-Help Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] After the Executive Yuan instructed the relevant ministries and commissions to quickly draft the implementation progress and specific steps of China's self-help plan, four units, including the Ministry of Finance, the National Resources Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, have now drafted and submitted them to the Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee. The plans of the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Communications are still being drafted. The various materials of this self-help plan were originally scheduled to be submitted to the US State Department for reference by the end of August, but were later postponed to the end of September. Due to the fact that the materials of some units have not been submitted, it has become impossible to extend it again. However, in any case, it must be sent out before the end of October. The US Aid Committee is the main drafter of organizing these materials. After the materials of each unit are submitted, the US Aid Committee will be responsible for comprehensively integrating the important points from the materials submitted by each unit and compiling them into a systematic report. The most important of these will be the reform of China's monetary system. The US Aid Committee has previously convened a joint symposium of various units to discuss whether it is necessary to convene a second meeting, which will be decided after Yan Jiagan returns to the country.</p>
<h3>Cleveland's Arrival in China: Expected to Fly to Shanghai in Four Days</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Cleveland, the head of the China Program Office of the Economic Cooperation Administration, departed for China tonight and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in four days. He is accompanied by Mr. Ssu Tsung-li, Yen Chia-kan, and Lin Wei-chun. Cleveland plans to stay in China for three to four weeks to discuss restoration and construction plans with [ECA official] Lapham and Chinese officials and businessmen, and to find ways to place these plans on a permanent foundation. Stuart Liddell announced today that he has selected a list of construction projects from over 200 applications, but cannot announce it until after discussions with the Chinese government. Cleveland stated that the restoration quotas for power plants in North China can be considered as coordinated with military operations. The success of these plants is closely related to the effort to contain the communists in the area. It is extremely important for maintaining non-communist China and the interests of other countries. The destruction of railway and power facilities, in addition to posing difficulties for the military commanders of the North China government, could lead to other more serious situations.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] The Public Advisory Committee, established to provide the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Administrator Hoffman with advice on the ECA's economic aid to China program, held its first meeting at the ECA headquarters here on the 29th. Four of the five committee members were sworn in before the meeting; Mrs. Moore, the fifth member, was unable to attend today's meeting. The committee has a lengthy agenda to address, including: the ECA General Counsel's review of the aid to China legislation, a report on the aid to China legislation by the Director of the Far East Bureau of the State Department, a discussion of the work under the aid to China legislation and the organization of the aid to China program by [ECA] Washington Director Cleveland, and a discussion of the agency's vehicle construction and accessories program by Stuart Liddell, leader of the ECA aid to China survey team. The committee will also review various issues in preparation for future discussions.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Attracting Overseas Chinese Capital and Production Enterprises</h3>
<p>Since the currency reform, one of the positive developments has been the dramatic increase in remittances from overseas Chinese. There are two main reasons for this: one is increased exports, and the other is a reasonable exchange rate, with the latter being the most important. Because the exchange rate was too high, it was too unprofitable for exporters, who were forced to resort to concealment and smuggling, as evidenced by the facts of the past few years.</p>
<p>To prevent a large-scale evasion of these funds, the government promulgated on July 27th of this year eleven articles of measures for overseas Chinese capital and overseas Chinese citizens' funds to invest in domestic production enterprises. The purpose was to open avenues for foreign exchange funds staying abroad or overflowing into other regions to return to the country. However, the conditions were too harsh and the restrictions too strict, placing heavy burdens on overseas Chinese businessmen with remittances, depositors with overseas funds, and importers who commissioned the import of goods. They hesitated and made no progress. For a month, until the economic reform on August 19th, these measures were practically just empty talk and had no effect. This was due to the short time frame, and most parties involved were not yet ready to take action. The designated uses were limited to agriculture, forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, industry, mining, water conservancy, public utilities, and transportation. The establishment of new enterprises or the expansion of old ones required various conditions. The imported production equipment had to be confirmed as being for the applicant's own use, and the quantity of imported raw materials was limited to no more than six months of production needs. Any violation would result in the applicant or the commissioned importer being permanently banned from receiving raw material allocations and permanently disqualified from applying for any goods. These strict restrictions and penalties were too burdensome and frightening, discouraging any interest in running a business. Why? Those with foreign capital may not have a deep interest in or experience with the aforementioned production enterprises. If an overseas Chinese businessman has accumulated considerable capital, he must have been abroad for a long time and may not be familiar with the economic situation in the country, making it even more difficult for him to return willingly. Therefore, these measures were more accurately described as restricting the inflow of foreign exchange rather than attracting it. The ancient saying "going south by driving the chariot north" aptly describes such measures.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures Decree, and the simultaneous announcement of Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets of Citizens of the Republic of China Deposited Abroad, the situation is now different. The Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital and Overseas Chinese Citizens' Funds to Invest in Domestic Production Enterprises are reportedly being revised by the relevant authorities. With the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets of Citizens Abroad already providing a framework, the remaining issue is only overseas Chinese capital, which is a narrower scope. The key points are reportedly: (1) how to prove it is overseas Chinese remittance, and (2) when investing in production enterprises, there must be a production plan approved by relevant domestic authorities (see this newspaper's issue of the 28th). The former is intended to prevent abuse by non-overseas Chinese citizens' funds, while the latter is intended to strengthen the restrictions on production enterprises and prevent the inflow of funds into non-production enterprises. Objectively speaking, these can be seen as necessary measures. However, in handling this issue, there are two key points that must be highlighted and brought to the attention of the authorities:</p>
<p>First, whether it is overseas Chinese capital or funds of Chinese citizens abroad, our greatest goal should always be to have it flow back, not to exclude it and allow it to remain abroad. This is a simple and clear reason that does not need further explanation. Therefore, all measures should only guide it, help it, and open doors to attract it, making it easier to flow in, in order to make the most of it. We should not add unnecessary procedures and troubles to obstruct its inward flow. Since the economic reform, the redemption of domestic gold banknotes has been remarkably successful, increasing the country's capital considerably. However, the registration and management of foreign exchange assets abroad has yet to be promoted, indicating that attracting foreign capital is much more difficult than redeeming domestic gold banknotes. Recently, there have been rumors that relevant authorities are considering opening up foreign exchange for personal use to maintain domestic production, mainly allowing the purchase of raw materials or equipment for import without attaching conditions such as establishing a factory for self-use. This is more reasonable and progressive than the regulations for applying to import when investing in domestic production enterprises. We sincerely hope that this idea will be quickly adopted when revising the above measures.</p>
<p>Second, although the so-called "production enterprises" in Article 1 of the aforementioned measures include agricultural product processing, export businesses, and handicrafts, judging from the wording of Articles 2, 3, and 4, the meaning clearly leans towards establishing factories. Factories engage in production, without a doubt. But if no one brings in raw materials and equipment for use, how can factories engaged in production have everything they need and want at will? If the produced goods are not promoted by wholesalers, transporters, and retailers, is the task of production then considered complete? Other industries such as finance and transportation may seem like ordinary commerce and have no direct relationship with production enterprises, but without these industries, can large-scale production enterprises proceed smoothly? Therefore, while guiding overseas Chinese capital to run production enterprises is an attractive slogan, we should interpret the four characters of "production enterprises" in a broad sense, and not rigidly limit it to running factories. Moreover, factories vary in size. If they are all required to handle raw materials, equipment, and even sales themselves, that is simply not feasible. If that were the case, then only the word "factory" is needed, why retain the word "business"?</p>
<p>We believe that foreign capital, whether it belongs to overseas Chinese or is deposited abroad by Chinese citizens, is better guided back for our own use than left abroad for others to use. Many orders are constantly left abroad and cannot be imported because they do not meet the import terms, or have already been imported but are re-exported, remaining in Hong Kong or the Philippines? If these orders are not luxury goods or strictly prohibited items, we also advocate quickly allowing them to be imported with leniency, to enrich the material supply and stabilize people's livelihoods. These matters can no longer be hesitated or delayed. Because material is just another form of capital, and the ultimate use of capital cannot escape exchanging for materials. Therefore, attracting overseas Chinese capital, registering assets, and permitting the import of orders are all the same in effect.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Types of Legal Tender Public Bonds: Early Redemption Starts Today; Registration for Exchange of Consolidated Public Bonds to be Done First; All Deadlines at the End of Next March, Expired Bonds are Void</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After receiving instructions from the Executive Yuan to promulgate and circulate the Measures for Handling Government Legal Tender Public Bonds and the Measures for Handling Foreign Currency Bonds, the Ministry of Finance immediately instructed the responsible departments to prepare all procedures. Arrangements with the managing banks for handling the early redemption and bond exchange were also completed. It is learned that the ministry announced that it will begin processing the early redemption of Legal Tender Public Bonds and the registration for exchanging foreign currency bonds for new bonds starting October 1st. The early redemption of Legal Tender Public Bonds covers seventeen types. The original measures stipulated that all principal due after August 20th, 1948, will be redeemed early. Interest coupons for the most recent period of each bond that are due after August 20th will be paid at the original interest rate up to September 30th, after which no interest will be calculated. The redemption standard is based on the market price of general Legal Tender Public Bonds on August 19th of this year, and the redemption multiple is determined according to the issuance date of each bond. The corresponding amount of Legal Tender to be repaid is then converted into Gold Yuan at the statutory conversion rate. Bondholders should immediately bring their bond certificates, interest coupons, and seals to the nearest managing bank (any of the four banks: Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau) to apply for redemption.</p>
<p>Foreign currency bonds to be exchanged for Consolidated Public Bonds cover four types. All principal due after August 20th, 1948, along with the most recent interest coupon (interest calculated up to September 30th), will be exchanged for Consolidated Public Bonds of the Republic of China for the 37th year [1948]. However, since the Consolidated Public Bonds have not yet been printed, registration procedures will be carried out first. Bondholders should bring their bond certificates, interest coupons, and seals to the nearest managing bank (also the four banks and one bureau) to apply for registration, submit the original foreign currency bonds to the bank, and obtain a temporary receipt. After the bonds are printed, they can be exchanged for bond certificates upon presentation of the receipt.</p>
<p>The deadline for redeeming Legal Tender Public Bonds and registering foreign currency bonds for exchange is the end of next March. Bonds that have not been redeemed or registered for exchange by the deadline will be voided. Furthermore, bond certificates and interest coupons that matured before August 19th, 1948, should be presented by the bondholder to the managing bank for redemption of principal and interest in accordance with the original redemption procedures and are not included in the above-mentioned doubled redemption and exchange for new bonds.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Committee to Hold National Conference Today</h3>
<p>Confiscated Foreign-Style Houses in the Capital to be Sold on Schedule</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Executive Yuan's Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Committee is scheduled to hold a national enemy and puppet property handling conference at the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 1st. More than 20 heads of enemy and puppet property handling bureaus from various regions have arrived in Nanjing to attend. The main task of the conference is to discuss strengthening the handling of enemy and puppet property, to complete the handling within a very short period of time, and to listen to reports from the heads of various units on the handling of enemy and puppet materials and the difficulties encountered in their work. The conference will be chaired by He Hao-ruo, and Premier Weng will attend to deliver a speech. The conference is scheduled for two days, but will be extended by one day if necessary. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Committee held a routine meeting on the morning of the 30th and decided on several points: (1) Fifteen confiscated foreign-style houses in Nanjing will be advertised for sale on October 5th. More than 70 other houses are occupied by various agencies and will be handled in the second phase. (2) Original occupants of houses advertised for sale who are unable to purchase them will be ordered to move out within one month. (3) During the period of enemy occupation, if the original residential houses were destroyed and new houses were built on the original foundation by the enemy or puppets, the landowners have the right of first refusal to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Fujian Plans to Mine Longyan Coal Mine and Invites Overseas Chinese to Invest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xiamen, 30th] Authorities in Fujian estimate that the Longyan anthracite coal mine in Fujian Province has reserves of over 1 trillion tons, making it the largest coal mine in the province. It has recently been decided to start mining with a capital of US$5 million. The province has drafted a plan and sent personnel to various overseas locations to invite overseas Chinese to invest.

<h3>Measures for Selling Shares of State-Owned Enterprises to be Improved; Discussion Scheduled for Next Tuesday; Technical Modifications to be Discussed Next Tuesday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] To study improvements in the techniques for selling shares of state-owned enterprises, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has scheduled a meeting for next Tuesday (the 5th) to invite relevant agencies such as the Resources Committee, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Finance to review the sale of shares of state-owned enterprises. Regarding rumors that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to revise the sales measures, Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and Fei Mingyang, Director of the Control Department, both denied this to reporters on the 30th. Since the sale of shares of state-owned enterprises began, the public's enthusiasm for purchasing has not been very high, but the basic methods and principles of the sale will not change. The proportion of total asset value that is sold, aside from what has already been sold, has been allocated to prepare for the issuance of Gold Yuan, making it difficult to change the situation. For example, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stipulates that 50% will be sold, which is already a significant amount. Selling over 600 million Gold Yuan worth of shares is already difficult. Further increasing the amount will only make it more difficult for the public to purchase. The issuance of shares is entrusted to the Central Bank to be sold by various national banks and bureaus, and this method cannot be changed. Opening up the stock market is currently impossible. However, how to increase the rights enjoyed by the public after purchasing shares will be further discussed when the Ministry of Industry and Commerce convenes a meeting with various agencies next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation to Issue Dividends and Bonuses to Private Shareholders This Month; New Shares to be Converted Based on Capital Ratio</h3>

<h3>Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Releases "One Week of War Situation": Major Decisive Battle Expected in Central Shandong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released "One Week of War Situation" from September 23rd to 29th, stating:</p>
<p>1. Northeast Battlefield</p>
<p>(Liaoxi Campaign) Northeast Front: The bandit forces operating between Suizhong and Xingcheng on the Guandong section of the Beining Railway, which had been repelled by our army on the 19th, have since been reinforced with a large number of bandit troops transferred from southern and northern Liaoning, starting on the 23rd. Currently, the bandit units identified on the Liaoxi battlefield include the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Columns. In addition, there are also bandit cavalry divisions, the 6th Independent Division, the 8th Independent Division, and artillery units from the 18th Military Sub-district participating in the operations. Starting on the 25th, our Nationalist troops in Jinzhou, in coordination with the air force, launched a proactive offensive north of Jinzhou, engaging in fierce battles for a day and a night, killing and wounding over 10,000 bandits, inflicting a major setback on their forces. The bandit forces and our troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in recent days. In the Jinxi, Xingcheng, and Suizhong area, although bandit units such as the 4th Column, the 6th Independent Division, and the 8th Independent Division have repeatedly harassed the area, our army has calmly confronted them, preventing any major advances by the bandits. On the Yixian front, our troops have fought bravely and tenaciously, and as of the 29th, the bitter battle has lasted for 17 days. Parts of the 3rd, 7th, and 9th bandit Columns have repeatedly clashed with our troops on the outskirts of the city, suffering heavy casualties. Our city defenses remain firm and intact. As for the main bandit forces around Changchun and Siping, they are gradually concentrating in the areas of Xinlitun and Zhangwu, preparing for a major decisive battle.</p>
<p>2. North China Battlefield</p>
<p>The 11th Column of the Li Yunchang bandit forces, which had been harassing the Guannei section of the Beining Railway, and a part of the local bandit military district forces, have been repelled by our army this week. All strongholds along the line have also been successively recovered. The units of the Nie Rongzhen 2nd and 4th bandit Columns, which had invaded the southeastern area of Shunyi, are urgently attempting to flee south for reorganization and replenishment, but are being pursued and suppressed by our main force on the Pinggu Line. They are still wandering around the eastern and western areas of Pinggu. However, the main force of the Nie Rongzhen 1st and 2nd Columns and a part of the 6th Column have been fleeing north to southern Suiyuan from the southwestern area of Datong since the 25th. Our Nationalist troops have concentrated their forces in advance to deploy a counterattack, and have moved the units from Liangcheng and Jining to the flanks of the bandits. On one hand, the local government is leading the people to thoroughly implement a scorched-earth policy. Currently, the bandits are attacking various strongholds between Zhuozishan, Jining, and Guisui. The battle near Guisui began on the 27th. Our troops are fiercely resisting, and the air force has also been mobilized to bomb. The bandits' intrusion into Suiyuan has now officially encountered a counterattack coordinated by our army and the people.</p>
<p>3. East China Battlefield</p>
<p>During the week from the 23rd to the 29th, the East China battlefield showed two different situations. One was that Jinan, isolated on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway on the edge of the Yellow River, was captured by the bandits. The other was that in northern Jiangsu, eastern Henan, and northern Anhui, the main force of the bandits, after being pushed north of the Haizhou Road by the Nationalist army, continued to gather in the central Shandong area, creating a situation in which a major decisive battle is expected to occur soon. Currently, the Chen Yi's bandit troops on both sides of the Jinpu Railway have a total of sixteen column designations, of which five columns suffered heavy losses in the Jinan battle. The remaining bandits in Jixiang, Yutai, and Chengwu in western Shandong have been gradually driven out by the Nationalist army and are retreating towards Jining and Caozhou. Currently, the bandits' 1st, 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns are firmly defending this line with three lines of fortifications, appearing to be preparing to resist step by step.</p>
<p>The Jinan campaign is the prelude to the major battle in central Shandong. Although the bandits occupied Jinan, they had not yet caught their breath when they urgently transferred the 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns, and the 2nd and 12th Columns, which had retreated from northern Jiangsu, to both sides of the Jinpu Railway south of Yanzhou, in order to defend against the advance of our main army and prepare for stubborn resistance. The intention to flee to eastern Henan to disperse our forces. We have thorough plans for the suppression of the Chen and Liu bandit troops and can ensure that the bandits dare not squarely face the eastern Henan battlefield or attempt to escape by chance.</p>

<h3>International Control of Atomic Energy Problem: Political Committee Begins Debate; Canada Asks UN General Assembly to Adopt U.S. Plan; Vishinsky to Present Reply Today</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th Dispatch] The United Nations Political Committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon, deciding to place the following six items on the agenda first: (1) Report of the Atomic Energy Commission; (2) Soviet disarmament proposal; (3) Palestine issue; (4) Greek issue; (5) Korean issue; (6) Colonial issue. It is expected that it will take six to seven weeks to complete the discussion of these six items. After that, the Political Committee will hold another meeting to decide on other items that need to be discussed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th Dispatch] The UN General Assembly Political Committee met on the 30th to consider two proposals by Soviet representative Vishinsky: "Banning Atomic Bombs" and "Five Great Powers Reduce Armies by One-Third." Canadian atomic energy expert McNaughton said in a speech that only the United States has enough atomic bombs to launch an atomic war. McNaughton also praised the U.S. international atomic energy control plan and said that the Soviet plan has no definite guarantees. He said, "The control stipulated in the Soviet plan only aims to drastically reduce the military strength of the United States, because the United States is the only country that possesses atomic bombs, at least the only country that has enough power to launch an atomic war." He said that he hoped that the UN General Assembly debate could produce a basis for the resumption of negotiations on atomic energy control between the East and West. He then moved to request the UN General Assembly to pass the U.S. atomic energy control plan and urged all member states of the United Nations to accept the U.S. plan as a basis for the development of international control plans. McNaughton said that the public knows that atomic bombs exist in the world, and their power is enough to destroy civilization. He warned that the discovery of new fissile materials, the development of new types of bombs, and other new discoveries in the development process will make future atomic bombs far more devastating than those suffered by Japan. McNaughton's cautious wording did not completely deny the possibility that the Soviet Union also has atomic bombs, but undoubtedly indicated that in terms of quantity and quality, the United States can look down on the world. McNaughton said that the atomic bombs used in Japan were "prototypes," of which only a "small amount" of nuclear power was emitted. He also said that the current efficiency has been "greatly improved," and even said that "the possibilities in this area can be expressed by moving a decimal point." U.S. representative Austin blamed the Soviet Union for the slow progress in atomic control, because the Soviet plan only prohibits atomic energy without stipulating effective international control. "Because the Soviet Union insists on its sovereignty above the safety and survival of the whole, fear has replaced hope. We must work together to bring the discovery of the atom back to life. Only with international guarantees can the application of atomic energy not be used for destruction, and only then can we have long-term security." Austin firmly declared, "The United States is still willing to place its atomic development monopoly under international control with safety guarantees." After Austin's speech, a lengthy procedural debate broke out in the committee. Other committee members were unwilling to speak on the Canadian motion. Chairman Spaak was about to announce the end of the general debate when Vishinsky suddenly objected. He said that the Canadian representative's motion was only circulated on the morning of the 30th, so he did not intend to speak quickly. The meeting was postponed to October 1st, when the Soviet Union is expected to present a reply. According to McNaughton's motion, the UN General Assembly is required to pass the report and recommendations of the Atomic Energy Control Committee, including the U.S. control plan, and "call on all countries to accept the control basis adopted by this committee and assume responsibility for the people of the world." The preamble acknowledges that if the world wants to survive in the atomic age, "there is no other way to go on the atomic issue except for countries to voluntarily share sovereignty."</p>
<h3>The Berlin Incident is a Concern for International Security; the UN General Assembly Faces a Major Test; Dulles Advocates That Major Powers Stop Using the Veto</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Paris, 29th Dispatch] Dulles, Dewey's foreign policy advisor, gave a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace here tonight, stating that there is reason to submit the Berlin issue to the United Nations Security Council, as its purpose is to safeguard peace and justice.</p>
<p>Dulles admitted that it is a major burden for the United Nations to handle the issue caused by the Soviet Union's land blockade of Berlin at this time. He said that the existence of the Berlin issue is a great regret, but since this issue exists and international peace and security are facing a major test, any possible way to seek a solution should not be dismissed without trying. The United Nations is not only an appropriate venue for orderly handling of the situation, but also the only international venue. Regardless of the risky nature of this work for the United Nations, even if these risks do exist, efforts to safeguard peace and justice are paramount. Peace can never be achieved without taking any risks. When discussing the work of the Security Council, Dulles believes that its greatest function is to peacefully resolve disputes, and said that in terms of peacefully resolving disputes, the veto power of major powers should automatically be suspended.</p>

<h3>Aylwen Elected New Mayor of London</h3>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Embroiled in Corruption Case; Minister of Economic Stabilization Agency, Kurisu, Summoned; Ashida Cabinet May Be Forced to Resign</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Some Japanese officials here predicted on the 30th that the Ashida Cabinet, which has been in power for seven months, may resign due to one of its cabinet members being involved in Japan's "largest post-war corruption case." Kurisu, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, is heavily suspected in the large-scale corruption case involving the loan from the Japan Reconstruction Bank to Showa Denko, Japan's largest fertilizer manufacturer. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is prepared to issue an arrest warrant for Kurisu, but will delay action until after the interrogation.</p>
<p>Kurisu was serving as the President of the Reconstruction Bank at the time of the loan. Other key officials from various ministries of the cabinet who have been arrested in this case have reached 25 people. A cabinet spokesperson strongly denied rumors that the cabinet is considering resignation. He said: The cabinet has "absolute trust" in Kurisu.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida summoned Minister of Justice Suzuki and held a meeting with Tomibechi on the 30th due to Kurisu being summoned. After the meeting, he made a statement saying: "After listening to President Suzuki's report, since Kurisu is being summoned and not arrested, the cabinet does not need to immediately express its attitude, and there is no need to convene a cabinet meeting on the 30th. We will observe the development of the situation and then decide on the government's actions. Therefore, the issue of Kurisu's successor as Minister of State does not need to be resolved in advance."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Director of the Social Democratic Party's Diet Policy Committee, Yonekubo, spoke about the Social Democratic Party's attitude on the Kurisu being summoned issue on the 30th, saying: "If Kurisu is prosecuted, the Liberal Party will submit a motion of no confidence in the cabinet. Our party is a friendly party of the government and cannot coordinate with the Liberal Party." He also said that Kurisu will resign after being prosecuted, and the cabinet does not need to bear joint responsibility. However, if the incident develops further and the reason lies in the actions of the Ashida cabinet, our party may demand the resignation of the entire cabinet, not just Kurisu's personal resignation.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Delivers Speech to the Assembly, Emphasizing the Construction of a National Defense Army; Requests to Join the United Nations and Participate in the Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 30th Dispatch] According to an unofficial translation of the speech given by Republic of Korea President Syngman Rhee to the National Assembly on the 30th, Rhee emphasized the need to build a Korean defense army to defend this new republic.

He said: "The scale of the national defense army will be kept small, and it will be used to pay for crises during peacetime and protect our national policy."</p>
<p>He also said: The Korean government, in close cooperation with the United States, will strive for the friendship of "many countries" and assume Korea's international obligations. Rhee said: Korea's basic national policy is to "create a democratic country that is capable of maintaining the welfare of the people and maintaining national prestige, and pass it on to future generations without end. The Republic of Korea is a completely sovereign and necessary country and will never reward the privileges of individuals or groups." He also announced the establishment of a "National Defense Bureau" as part of the administrative plan. Rhee said that the Republic of Korea, in accordance with the obligations of the Allied countries, "has obtained the support of most Allied countries" and established "a country that is deeply believed to advocate justice and peace, and our country must be recognized according to the example of China, the United States, and the Philippines." He hopes that Korea can join the United Nations, request to participate in the peace treaty with Japan, and reserve the right to demand "legal" compensation from Japan.</p>

<h3>Indonesian Army Division Mutinies; Has Joined the Communist Army</h3>
<p>Rumors that the Netherlands has Sent Troops to Aid Indonesia</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 30th Dispatch] Yogyakarta Radio admitted on the 30th that a part of the Indonesian 4th Division of Yogyakarta suddenly mutinied. According to reports, it has entered the communist camp and is advancing towards Surakarta, 35 miles north of the rebel base of Madiun. The broadcast Zhu explained the strength of the mutinying troops. Surakarta is located 50 miles east of the rebel-occupied Pwerda area and is home to the Royal Dutch Shell oil refinery and Standard Oil Company property.

<h3>Personnel Changes in the Soviet Government: Strengthening Organization to Advance Plans</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Before departing for vacation from Moscow, Stalin reorganized the Soviet government to strengthen its organization in preparation for the harsh winter. This can be seen in the gradual replacement of key Soviet government personnel over the past month, but the slow pace made it difficult for outsiders to notice immediately. The most significant change is likely the reorganization of the Ministry of Railways, with Stalin replacing Kovalev with Beshchev as the Minister and appointing four new Deputy Ministers, indicating dissatisfaction with the Ministry's performance. However, these railway personnel changes are not enough to alarm Soviet political experts, as it is widely known that railways are a crucial part of the Five-Year Plan. Furthermore, due to the increasingly tense international situation, Stalin intends to streamline the railways. Another important event is the appointment of Krutikov as a Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Central Government. This inner cabinet, composed of several Deputy Chairmen, is each responsible for a specific political or economic function, coordinating the work of the permanent ministers, such as Andreyev's oversight of agriculture, Kosygin's responsibility for finance, and Beria's exclusive control over atomic research. Krutikov was originally the Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, so he will likely oversee foreign trade, but as Foreign Trade Minister Zhukovsky is also a Deputy Chairman, the division of powers between the two remains questionable.</p>

<h3>Over Fifty Workers from Pingwang Intercepted While Purchasing Yarn for Export</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The North Station Police Precinct received a tip-off on the 29th stating that men and women were carrying large quantities of cotton yarn and boarding Ning-Shao river merchant ships at the Tianhou Palace Bridge on Henan Road, bound for Pingwang and other places.

<h3>Pre-War Half-Dollar Silver Coins Not Allowed to Circulate</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to Central Bank officials, pre-war half-dollar silver coins are not allowed to circulate in the market today and must be exchanged for Gold Yuan certificates within a specified period. The exchange rate is one Gold Yuan certificate for each half-dollar silver coin. The official announcement regarding the permissible auxiliary currency for circulation has been detailed in major newspapers. However, the usage of auxiliary currency in various provinces has not yet been reported, so it is difficult to provide a responsible answer at this time.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Declares Boldly That Hu Hao's Savings Are Like a Grain of Rice in a Granary</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report, Guangzhou, 30th] Hu Wenhu recently made a statement in Hong Kong regarding the Hu Hao case, saying that the US$50,000 and 200 taels of gold saved by Hu Hao were a negligible amount.

<h3>More Suspects Arrested in Fuel Management Committee Corruption Case: Sun Jice and Others Transferred to Court, Two Coal Merchants Still Detained at Police Station</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] There has been a major development in the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee's coal transportation corruption case. The Police Bureau's Special Criminal Court, acting on a secret order from the Municipal Government the day before yesterday, arrested suspects related to the case: Sun Jice (former head of the Fuel Management Committee's Distribution Department), the current head of the Coal Adjustment and Supply Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; Section Chief Lin Keying; Section Members Miao Shouzhu; Dai Weihua; Clerks Xu Baoguang; Ren Hui and coal merchants Sun Zhigang and Han Chengpu. The suspects were interrogated by Liu Fangxiong, Director of the Municipal Government's Investigation Office, together with Ying Zhichun, Section Chief of the Special Criminal Court's Third Section, until 11 PM. Due to strong suspicion, they were detained. Yesterday afternoon at 3:40 PM, Lin Keying and the other six were transferred to the District Court. The remaining two coal merchants were still under investigation, and an application has been made to extend their detention for seven days.</p>
<p>Sun and the others were sent to the District Court yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, where Judge Shen Tianbao opened the trial. Sun Jice and Lin Keying completely denied the accusation that they colluded with the Jiangzhe Shipping Company during their tenure at the Fuel Management Committee, obtaining 475 tons of coal per month from the Committee and selling it at black market prices for huge profits. Sun also stated that he was a member of the Youth Party and currently the head of the Municipal Coal Adjustment and Supply Office. As the office had just been established the morning before, and internal personnel had not yet been appointed, the office's operations were suspended after his arrest the night before, which greatly affected the city's coal distribution work. He and Lin jointly requested bail. Subsequently, Miao Shouzhu, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, and Ren Hui successively stated that they all denied receiving the 42 million yuan check from Zhou Jidao. Each of the four had financial dealings with Zhou, either lending money for profit or borrowing money from him for temporary use, but there was absolutely no transfer of money for bribes. As for whether the loans to Zhou had been settled or not, there were no records. When asked by the court whether Zhou's loans to them were a disguised form of bribery, they all vehemently denied it, saying that they often borrowed from him because Zhou's financial situation was better. All subsequently requested bail. The court considered this to be a major corruption case involving a wide range of people. The police bureau had not yet transferred the entire file to the court, so the request for bail was denied. The court adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>"Innocent" Without Gold: Female Teacher Goes to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The incident involving female teacher Zhou Jianshi carrying 35 gold bars out of Shanghai was resolved yesterday. She went to the Central Bank around 10:00 AM yesterday to see Supervisor Jiang. Secretary Gao introduced her to Lin Chongyong, Director of the Gold Management Bureau. After explaining the reasons for taking the gold to Hangzhou, she expressed her willingness to exchange the gold bars for Gold Yuan in Shanghai before going to Hangzhou. In the afternoon, the Gold Management Bureau sent personnel to accompany her to the Central Bank for the exchange, which was completed around 5:00 PM. Because her situation was special, after the exchange, she went to the Central Bank's Treasury Department to complete written procedures. She then took the train to Hangzhou on the same day. In her haste to depart, she left her aluminum personal seal with the name "Party Minzhi" in the Central Bank's Treasury Department. The person in charge of the department has sent a special letter to notify her to come to Shanghai to retrieve it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Dying Struggle, Frantic Screams and Curses: Mastermind of Plot to Sabotage Power Plant, Wang Xiaohe, Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Wang Xiaohe, the mastermind behind the plot to sabotage the Shanghai Power Company's machinery, was executed by firing squad at the Special Criminal Court yesterday.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaohe was an employee of the Shanghai Power Company and a standing director of the Power Workers' Union. He attempted to sabotage the power company by instigating Wu Guozhen and others to mix iron filings into the machinery's axles, attempting to cause the machines to explode and create a world of darkness in order to achieve the purpose of disrupting public order. After the incident, he was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters. The Special Criminal Court sentenced him to death. On the 24th of this month, the Central Special Criminal Court upheld the death sentence upon review. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, the Special Criminal Court took the accused Wang from the Longchang Road Detention Center for execution. Wang was 25 years old, physically strong, with disheveled hair, wearing an old striped shirt, blue work trousers, and black cloth shoes. His attitude was extremely stubborn, and his hands were handcuffed behind his back. At 9:15 AM, Prosecutor Zhu Cheng took his seat and brought Wang to the case, verifying his identity and informing him that he was ordered to be executed today. When asked if he had any last words, Wang stated three points in court: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau used this means to seize the Power Workers' Union; (2) The Garrison Department extracted a confession through torture; (3) The Special Criminal Court did not allow defense lawyers to appear in court, conducting a secret trial. He also shouted: "Dying unjustly, the Special Criminal Court is murdering people!" When asked by the court if he had any last words for his family, he said that he wanted to see his family and would not write a will. He was urged to drink alcohol to reduce his pain, but he only took a sip, saying that he did not know how to drink. At this point, Prosecutor Zhu ordered the accused Wang to be taken to the execution ground. On the way from the court to the execution ground, Wang continued to scream and curse incessantly. During the execution, because Wang's body kept swaying from side to side, he was tied to a chair. Ye Yaopeng, the squad leader of the Second Squadron of the Security Police's Machine Gun Corps, executed him. One bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his left cheek. After being untied, he fell to the ground, still moving his mouth and heart. Two more shots were fired to finish him off. It was exactly 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Three Points of Appeal, Rejection Upon Review</p>
<p>Also, the Central Special Criminal Court's review document, regarding Wang Xiaohe's part, in addition to detailing Wang's instigation to conspire to sabotage the motor, also responded to the three main points of the appellant's review application, namely: (1) Failure to notify his appointed defense attorney to appear in court to defend him, and a secret trial, was a clear violation of the law. (2) The confession and statements made by the applicant at the Garrison Brigade were all extracted through torture. (3) Placing coarse iron layers in the motor axles would never cause an explosion and would not result in a criminal outcome. According to the law, his sentence should be reduced or waived. The arguments were rejected separately. The original text stated: "This court finds that for crimes violating the National Emergency Criminal Law During the Suppression of Rebellion Period, the trial of the case, according to Article 10 of the same law, may only allow defense personnel to appear in court to defend, and does not adopt mandatory defense. The original trial did not approve the defense attorney selected by the applicant to appear in court to defend him, and therefore did not violate the law.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Proves That Torture Was Not Used</p>
<p>(2) The court found that when the Garrison Brigade interrogated this case, it was handled jointly with Fan Cai Kui, a specialist from the Social Affairs Bureau. According to the specialist's in-court testimony in the original trial, they cooperated in the interrogation and confirmed that torture was not used. (3) According to engineer Wang Feiyun's testimony in the original trial: "Coarse iron filings are not easy to penetrate. If they are fine filings, they may explode immediately. If the time is slightly longer, the coarse iron filings can turn into fine iron filings, and an explosion is certain." Therefore, the applicant's claim that placing coarse iron filings would not result in a criminal outcome is obviously insufficient. The applicant's claims are all untenable." The conclusion stated that "Wang Xiaohe instructed Zhang Shibao to supply iron filings and handed them over to Wu Guozhen to put them into the motor axles. Inquiring into his intentions, he believed that when the current stopped and Shanghai became dark, chaos would occur, thereby supporting the Communist bandits and overthrowing the government. His heart is punishable, and his situation is absolutely unforgivable."</p>

<h3>Truckloads of Smuggled Goods Intercepted in Jiading: Five People Involved Released on Bail</h3>
<p>At 5:00 AM on the 29th, two trucks loaded with daily necessities such as cotton cloth and sugar were secretly transported out of Zhenru and intercepted by the Jiading Police Bureau. They were submitted to the Economic Control Supervision Office for review. One of the two trucks, No. 08-0466, belongs to the Dingkang Transportation Company, and the other, No. 03-4161, belongs to the Fuhe Transportation Company. Both were commissioned by the Zhongnan Transportation Company (located at No. 11, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road) on the 29th. Truck No. 03-4161 was loaded with 6,100 catties of sugar, 610 boxes of 200-cigarette packs of cigarettes, 349 boxes of 500-cigarette packs, and 3 pieces of fruit. The driver was Qian Guisheng, and the cargo escort was Yang Zhongying. Truck No. 08-0466 was loaded with 374 bolts of cotton cloth, 1,950 catties of sugar, and 7 pieces of fruit. The driver was Qin Delong, and the cargo escort was Yu Zugen. The drivers, cargo escorts, and Gan Xiaochang, the person in charge of the Zhongnan Transportation Company, were all summoned by the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday. According to Gan's confession, the items loaded on the two trucks were all consigned by various scattered households in Kunshan. All five were released on bail pending trial. As for the loaded cotton cloth and sugar, which are all on the list of prohibited goods, they were ordered to sign a pledge for safekeeping and will be dealt with according to the law. The cigarettes, fruit, and other items, which are not on the list of prohibited goods, will be returned.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Demand That All Coal Prices Remain the Same</h3>
<p>Representatives Sent to Petition in Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] It is reported that public utility companies from all over the country, due to the Executive Yuan's promulgation that the price of coal used by public utilities will be charged at the old price before "August 19th" for up to 70%, and the new price for the remaining 30%, felt unable to bear the losses. Therefore, they sent multiple representatives to Beijing yesterday morning to petition the relevant authorities to maintain the "August 19th" allocated price for all coal.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Employees' Welfare Society Distributes Woolen Cloth</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Government Employees' First Welfare Society reopened its stores, purchases were extremely enthusiastic. As it is now late autumn, and Municipal Government employees urgently need to purchase winter clothes, the Society specially negotiated with China Textile to allocate woolen cloth, and registration has already begun. In the future, if confiscated materials are sold off, the Society will also distribute them as much as possible to promote the welfare of colleagues.</p>
<h3>October Rice Prices to Remain the Same; Rice Ration Coupons Will Be Distributed Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Regarding the rice price for October, the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee received a telegram from the Central Government yesterday, deciding to maintain the original price from September, that is, 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou for whole rice and 1.6 million Legal Tender per dou for broken rice. The rice ration coupons for October are now ready by the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee and can be distributed to the district offices starting today. It is expected that citizens in each district will be able to receive the rice ration coupons before the 5th of this month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the Allocation Department of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, the rice shipped from the United States stipulates that broken rice must account for one-third. However, the sales of broken rice have been poor in recent months. Prolonged accumulation is not a good policy, so the authorities will change their methods to sell this batch of broken rice.</p>
<h3>Automotive Gasoline Conservation: Implemented Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Regarding the strict implementation of automotive gasoline conservation in the city, the deliberation committee resolved on three plans, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Now, in order to cooperate with the Central Government's method of reducing the city's gasoline quota, the Municipal Government has revised the temporary measures according to the third plan through the deliberation committee and has ordered the Shanghai Gasoline Allocation Committee and the Public Utilities Bureau to implement them separately starting today. The temporary measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Temporary Measures</p>
<p>(1) A. Public buses and long-distance buses; B. Automobiles that maintain municipal administration and public service; C. Automobiles that enjoy diplomatic privileges; D. Cargo trucks and taxis with formal licenses will not be reduced. However, if cargo trucks and taxis use or dispose of allocated gasoline for improper purposes, once discovered, their license plates and oil purchase permits will be revoked, and in serious cases, their licenses will also be revoked. (2) Except for the above-mentioned vehicles, the remaining vehicles will conserve gasoline by referring to the principle of reducing automobiles by "four-to-one" or "two-to-one."</p>
<p>The Director of the Public Utilities Bureau has issued a statement saying that if there are illegal speculators who take the opportunity to sell gasoline on the black market, or automobiles that only obtain the basic oil allocation secretly rely on the black market, once discovered, the vehicle licenses will be revoked for both those selling on the black market and those buying from the black market, and severe penalties will be imposed.</p>
<h3>Authorities Decide to Launch General Inventory Check: Inspect One Type of Material in the Same Period to Prevent Concealment and Evasion of Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Jiang Jingguo convened the ninth economic inspection meeting at the Central Bank conference room yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. The committee members present included Zhang Shi, Cheng Yikuan, Lin Chongyong, and Yu Jiyu. It was resolved at the meeting that to promote future economic management work, it is first necessary to conduct a survey and statistics on daily necessities. Therefore, it was decided to launch a general inventory check within days, inspecting the same type of materials in the same period to prevent concealment and evasion. This task is scheduled to be completed within three days. In order to prevent disturbing the people, unified inspection regulations will be established, and inspection personnel will be issued badges for identification. Supervisor Jiang solemnly stated at the meeting yesterday that the Central Government has decided to overcome all difficulties and implement established policies. At the same time, it is planned to coordinate all regions of the country to stabilize prices. Over the past month, the work of stabilizing prices has had a considerable foundation, and there is still much work to be done in the future. He hopes that colleagues will intensify their work. Furthermore, the enthusiasm for exchanging gold certificates this time is enough to show the people's faith in the government, which he is deeply moved by. However, most major households have not yet fully exchanged all of their gold, silver, and foreign currency, which requires us to continue to work hard to enable them to contribute all of their possessions to the country.</p>
<h3>Trial of Dagong Bank Case Opens: Manager Claims Deafness and Denies Responsibility to the Outside World</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The case of Dai Chunfeng, former manager of Dagong Commercial Savings Bank, and Ma Jiaxin, assistant manager, being accused of violating the Banking Law, opened in the District Court yesterday afternoon. Dai Chunfeng, due to his deafness, prepared a written defense at the opening of the trial, stating: "There is a general manager above who has overall responsibility for all bank affairs, and an assistant manager below who is responsible for management. Because the defendant suffers from deafness, he is not responsible to the outside world and has not violated the Banking Law." Ma Jiaxin also denied the matter in his subsequent confession. The court ordered a postponement for retrial, and both defendants were released on bail pending trial.</p>
<h3>Administrative Fee Changes to Gold Yuan, Implemented in this City Today</h3>
<p>Company Licenses Increase Thirty Thousand Times</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to currency reform, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in accordance with the supplementary measures for organizing finance promulgated by the Executive Yuan, revised various administrative fees and collected them in Gold Yuan (9) (see the detailed table on page 5 of yesterday's newspaper). The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has received an order from the Ministry to adjust various industrial and commercial registrations, licenses, registration, and other fees from today, according to the new standards set by the Ministry. The new standards are tens of thousands of times higher than before. For example, the company license fee was originally only 500 legal tender, but now it has increased to 5 Gold Yuan, an increase of 30,000 times. The commercial establishment registration certificate fee was originally only 500 legal tender, but now it has increased to 2 Gold Yuan, an increase of 12,000 times.</p>
<h3>Assisting the Government in Implementing Financial and Economic Measures, Realizing the People's Livelihood-Based Social Movement, Wang Sheng Reiterates the Mission of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps and the Youth Service Corps While Hosting News Reporters</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo's cadres in the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps, like Chiang Ching-kuo himself, seem to be regarded as legendary "heroes" in the minds of many Shanghai people today. In fact, Supervisor Chiang is just an ordinary public servant with courage and a sense of justice, and his cadres in the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps are also an ordinary team working for the people with justice. Their activities certainly make unscrupulous merchants tremble and powerful families lose their courage, but they are not three-headed, six-armed, or murderous characters.</p>
<p>It has only been a little over a year since the establishment of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps. In the early part of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the authorities deeply felt that the military and civilians in the various pacification zones were disconnected, the Baojia system was corrupt, and spies were rampant. They felt it was necessary to cultivate a group of new talents to assist in the basic-level administration in areas close to the war zone. Therefore, the President issued a handwritten instruction to open a Suppression and Reconstruction Class under the Central Training Corps and established a training committee to supervise the matter. Zhang Lisheng was appointed as the director, and Chiang Ching-kuo was the deputy director. Hu Gui, a graduate of the third term of Whampoa Military Academy and deputy director of education at Chiang's intelligence (two) regiment, was responsible for the actual training tasks. He is now the commander of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps.</p>
<p>Does Not Directly Inspect or Arrest People</p>
<p>The Sixth Brigade, originally in Tangshan, has been transferred to Shanghai for more than a month, but the public's understanding of the nature and mission of the team is still very vague. Some people even think that they are special figures who can say anything. For this reason, Brigade Commander Wang Sheng specially hosted the press yesterday. He solemnly stated again that the mission of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps is very simple, that is, to "mobilize the people, assist the government, and implement the emergency measures for finance and economy." The Suppression and Reconstruction Corps itself is not a government office and is absolutely not responsible for directly carrying out inspections or arrests. In other words, the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps must cooperate with the military and police in this task and be in an assisting position under the command of the military and police organs. According to the brigade commander's report, the work achievements in the past month are as follows: (1) Fourteen people's service stations have been established, receiving a total of 1,871 secret reports, of which 36% were for raising prices, 15% for hoarding, 1.6% for smuggling materials, 3% for gold and banknote trading, 1.5% for housing disputes, 2.8% for political secret reports, 2.5% for corruption secret reports, 4.5% for suggestions, and 26% for other matters. All these secret reports are sent to Supervisor Chiang if they are major, and ordinary ones are handled by the economic police. The Suppression and Reconstruction Corps itself only assists in the investigation if it encounters particularly complicated cases.</p>
<p>Assisting in Participating in Economic Inspection Work</p>
<p>(2) People's discussion meetings were held in each district where people's service stations were established, extensively seeking out the people's hidden grievances. Citizens participated very enthusiastically. The general opinion was to impose the most severe punishments on unscrupulous merchants and hoped that the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps would be stationed in Shanghai for a long time. They deeply resented the exploitation of scalpers and middlemen. The Suppression and Reconstruction Corps relayed these opinions of the people to the authorities, and thus there was a large-scale capture of scalpers. In the future, they will continue to actively implement the crackdown on the exploitation of middlemen. (3) Assisting the economic police and participating in economic inspections, a total of one company of team members was dispatched and mixed and distributed among the various economic police brigades. In the past month, a total of 500 cases of illegal price increases, 100 cases of hoarding, 100 cases of black market, 11 cases of underground banks, 51 cases of buying and selling gold and banknotes, and 21 cases of evading foreign exchange have been handled. (4) Participating in the work of inspection stations organized by the military, police, and gendarmerie in the urban area, one person was dispatched to each station, and seven people were dispatched to the two railway bureau inspection stations. (5) One company of team members was sent to Wuxi to cooperate with the local administrative authorities to carry out the same tasks as in Shanghai. In the past month, many important cases have been solved, including the hoarding case of Central Pharmacy, the hoarding case of Da Ming Yarn Factory, the case of Lin Liangbao's funding of bandits with materials, and the hoarding case of Li Xinsheng Kerosene Company.</p>
<p>Anonymous Secret Reports Will Not Be Adopted</p>
<p>The work of the Suppression and Reconstruction Team is based on law and reason and has nothing mysterious about it. However, because the general public does not fully understand it, some criminals have impersonated members of the Suppression and Reconstruction Team to extort money or act lawlessly. Some foolish merchants were deceived and did not dare to speak out. The team has discovered four cases of impersonation and fraud. When the stolen money was recovered and returned to the original owners, these merchants, who were accustomed to the social atmosphere of Shanghai, were stunned and thought it was a great "miracle." Therefore, the brigade commander repeatedly urged citizens to pay attention. Whenever members of the Suppression and Reconstruction Team are dispatched for inspection or arrest, they must cooperate with the military and police and have their identification cards with them. Otherwise, they are impersonating and can be reported to the team or the security organs for detention. In addition, many of the secret reports received by the team's people's service station were not signed. After investigation, it was found that 40% were false accusations. Therefore, in the future, anonymous secret reports can only be used as a reference and will not be adopted. The name, address, and facts of the accused in the secret report should be described in detail. The secret report should be sent to the various people's service stations or mailed to the postal mailbox number Shen Zi 7009. Do not misplace it.</p>
<p>Will Never Allow Evil Forces to Run Rampant</p>
<p>Similarly, the recently established Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps is also an organization that is not a special class, not an executive agency, has no rights, and is completely obligatory, for the country and the people. According to Wang Sheng, who is also the commander of the corps, the reason for the establishment of the team is: first, to respond to the President's instruction to "the people should take the lead in helping the government," and second, to unite the forces of justice in the local area to permanently ensure that evil forces do not run rampant.</p>
<p>Of the members of the Youth Service Corps, 12% have a college degree or above, 45% have a middle school degree, 25% have an elementary school degree, and 18% have other degrees. 56% of the members' original occupations were in industry and commerce, 24% were students, 3% were freelancers, and 17% were others. The organization of the corps is divided into 20 brigades, which are under the jurisdiction of 100 companies. Each company has three platoons, and each platoon is divided into three groups, each group with 10 to 15 members. The work that the Youth Service Corps will soon begin is to assist the government in its lack of manpower, such as large-scale warehouse inspections. When working, they are under the command of the government, and each person has an armband as proof, which is taken back immediately after the work is completed. Therefore, their actions are also collective actions that cooperate with the military and police. There should not be a single person or a few people harassing others alone.</p>
<p>Unqualified People Will Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Some people suspect that the Youth Service Corps has a large number of people and complicated members, which may inevitably lead to abuses. Commander Wang reported yesterday that although the Youth Service Corps has a large number of people, it also has a large number of cadres. On average, each person controls more than 30 young team members, and he believes that bad elements will never escape the hands of his cadres. At the same time, while the current young team members are receiving in-team training, he is conducting assessments. Before October 3, unqualified luxury can be completely eliminated. After October 3, they will be confirmed as formal team members. After that, they will be given small-group training, not only political training, but also opportunities to pursue further education, so that they can become the backbone of starting a social revolution and changing social customs.</p>
<p>In short, Commander Wang said in summary that the establishment of the Youth Service Corps will definitely not have any effect on politics or competition for power and profit. The members who participate in the Youth Service Corps should all be proletarians, and those who have property should donate it to the country. The main task of the Youth Service Corps is to realize the people's livelihood-based social movement.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Collected Reaches 370 Million as of Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The deadline for collecting gold, silver, and foreign currency has been extended by the Executive Yuan meeting yesterday. The deadline for gold and foreign currency has been extended to October 31, and the deadline for silver ingots, silver dollars, and silver coins has been extended to November 30. The news did not reach this city until the evening, so citizens holding gold and banknotes all believed that yesterday was the last day for collection.

<h3>Commercial Registration Documents Pile Up Like Mountains, Social Affairs Bureau Classifies and Sorts Through Them Overnight</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The registration of the quantity of rice, flour, cooking oil, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, and industrial raw materials stored by all companies, firms, and factories in this city was completed at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau received tens of thousands of registration documents submitted directly by various trade associations and applications from peddlers and itinerant merchants, piling up like mountains. In addition to the staff of the Second Section of the Bureau being busy sorting them out, staff from the Third Section, Tenth Section, and the Labor-Capital Judgment Council were also transferred to assist in classifying and sorting them out overnight.

<h3>Longyan Anthracite Coal in Western Fujian</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Chen Xiaofeng</p>
<p>[Aviation News from Xiamen, Our Newspaper, 25th] Longyan is located in the center of western Fujian and has become a major town in western Fujian because it produces anthracite coal. Many people are not very unfamiliar with it. Because the domestic war has not ended, Shanghai has felt that the source of coal is difficult. Many Shanghai merchants have come to Yan to investigate coal deposits and transport Yan coal to Shanghai for trial use. However, there has been no follow-up so far, but we believe that if Shanghai's industry can jointly invest with the government to operate and come to mine and sell in large quantities, Longyan's coal will definitely have a bright future.</p>
<p>Most of the coal reserves in Longyan are anthracite. According to</p>
<p>Geological Analysis: Longyan's anthracite coal belongs to the Permian period and is sandwiched between sandstone and shale, about half a meter to two meters thick. However, the exact amount of coal reserves in Longyan is still unknown because it has not been explored with scientific instruments. According to the report of the measurement made by the Fujian Provincial Government before the war, the coal reserves in the entire county are about 27.55 million tons. Recently, according to the results of the survey conducted by Chen Qifa, a technician from the Construction Department, it is estimated that the coal reserves in the entire county are more than 30,000 tons. However, these statistical figures cannot include the entire coal area of Longyan, so the exact quantity cannot be determined.</p>
<p>Investigation Report: The distribution area and quantity of coalfields in the whole county are approximately as follows: In the Xinluo district of the affiliated city, from the southern extension of Xiagong Mountain to Tashi Mountain, it is about 2 kilometers long. From the east of Cui Ping Mountain through the north of Dong Bao Mountain to Tieshiyang, it is about 7 kilometers long. The coal reserves in these areas are about 13.7 million tons.</p>
<p>Northeast Longyan: Taking Yanshi Ridge in Yanshi as the center, it is about 5 kilometers long, with an estimated 4.56 million tons of medium-grade anthracite. The coalfield in Subang Village, Yanshi Town, is about 2 kilometers long, with about 2.7 million tons of coal reserves. The coal area in Dagicun, Shuilongtan and other areas in Yanshi Town is 5 kilometers long, with an estimated 3.64 million tons. The coal area of Keyuanting in Baisha Town is 2 kilometers around, with a coal seam thickness of 1.6 meters, and the quantity is estimated to be 5.8 million tons. Other areas such as Meihe Township, Suban Village, Jimei Mountain, and south of Yuntan are estimated to have coal reserves of about 3 million tons.</p>
<p>South Longyan Coal Area: It is estimated that there are more than 2 million tons in Baituzhen, Xiaokeng, Shagang Township Chuanxiang, east of Shenxi Jiangbang, and Wangzhuang area of Caoyun Township, and more than 1 million tons in Baotian, west of Shizhong Town.</p>
<p>West Longyan Coal Area: About 3 kilometers east of Longmen, there are a total of 3.34 million tons, and more than 1 million tons in the southeast of Tongjiang and Xiaochi area. According to the estimates of the above areas, the total amount of coal in the county is more than 40 million tons. Longyan's coal reserves account for about a quarter of the 153 million tons of coal reserves in Fujian Province.</p>
<p>Chemical Analysis: Anthracite coal is the best in coal mines, containing 94% carbon and 2.5% chlorine. However, Longyan's coal has been tested and is indeed the best white smoke coal, containing 64% to 86% carbon, 3.2% to 5.5% volatile matter, and 5% to 25% ash. According to the results of various tests, among the coal areas in the county, the coal in Jiulong Mountain in Neisaka Village, Longmen Town, is the best, with a carbon content of more than 90%, strong quality and black color, like dragon scales reflecting light, and strong firepower, which can be called high-grade anthracite. The next best is the coal in Xinluo district, with a carbon content of 92%, the coal in Baisha with a carbon content of 75%, and the coal in Huishi with a carbon content of 82%, all of which are rare coals. According to the opinions of general coal users, it is believed that anthracite coal contains very little moisture, which is convenient for transportation, and contains very little moisture, which is safe for storage, and contains less ash, which will not reduce the amount of maturity or block the fire door, and contains not much volatile matter, which is suitable for household cooking and winter heating. In terms of industry, anthracite coal can be used for ship transportation and factory power generation. If it can be refined into coking coal, its uses will be even wider. The quality of Longyan's coal is considered to be very good by all parties. If it can be mined by scientific methods, it has unlimited hopes in industry.</p>
<p>Due to inconvenient transportation and the lack of establishment of important industries, Longyan's coal still relies on 300 miners in the county to use hoes and other tools to exchange tastes. Only manpower is used to excavate about 35,000 tons per year for the cooking of households throughout the county and a small amount of charcoal burning.</p>
<p>As for the exploration of coal mines, machines such as drilling rigs have not yet been used. They almost all rely on past experience to use primitive hoes to explore the inner layers and walls of the mine, or add wooden pillars to support the frame to carry out mining operations. In today's construction of South China, this work is urgently needed.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Zhuzhou Railway Machinery Factory</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru</p>
<p>[News from Xiangtan, Our Newspaper, 26th] Zhuzhou in Xiangtan, Hunan, was originally a small town that was not noticed by everyone. Since the opening of the Yuehan Railway, this is the central station, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Xiang-Qian Railway both end here. Therefore, its value has increased tenfold. Due to the beautiful geographical environment, the central government had long planned to use Zhuzhou as an industrial zone. Before the war, many large-scale factories were preparing here, but they were all interrupted halfway due to the impact of the war. Today, three years after the victory, the work of rebuilding the factories is being actively resumed here. Currently, the larger-scale factories include Yongli Chemical Factory, Arsenal, Railway Machinery Factory, etc. Among the progress of the restoration of these three factories, Yongli is still fully focused on building the water tower project, and the arsenal has only built a few buildings. Only the Railway Machinery Factory has a little scale. Although it is still far from the completion of the entire project, some parts have already started construction. Therefore, when outsiders visit Zhuzhou, the Railway Machinery Factory is the only goal. This time, the reporter accompanied the Changsha reporter group to visit along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. On the first day, they arrived in Zhuzhou and, without taking a moment's rest, drove into the machinery factory in the original car for a two-hour tour.</p>
<p>The Construction Process: The machinery factory is not near Zhuzhou, but next to Tianxin Station, three kilometers north. The construction work began in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), and was initially completed in the spring of the 27th year (1938). The factory was preparing to manufacture locomotives in the future, but when the factory site was built, it only repaired locomotives and vehicles on the Yuehan and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways. Unexpectedly, while planning to continue expanding, the Japanese invaders suddenly launched a war of aggression against China. Soon, the flames of war spread to northern Hunan, and the Zhuzhou factory was bombed miserably. During the four battles of Changsha, the enemy's traces had repeatedly infiltrated Zhuzhou. After the baptism of war, this emerging factory was completely destroyed. When the Anti-Japanese War was won, only the steel frame of the locomotive and machine factory of the year's steel and concrete buildings survived, and the rest became rubble, overgrown with weeds and desolate smoke.</p>
<p>Factory Restoration Project: The factory restoration project began in August of the 35th year (1946) and is divided into two phases: the first phase is the repair factory period, and the second phase can achieve locomotive manufacturing. Now is the first phase of the project, and it is planned to complete the repair factory by the end of this year. The factory buildings that have been completed now include the locomotive workshop, machine workshop, temporary casting workshop, temporary forging workshop, temporary machine workshop, temporary power workshop, vehicle workshop, material warehouse, office, etc. The casting workshop, Baishigang Power Plant, and the expansion part of the locomotive machine workshop are under construction. According to the factory's report, they can all be completed within the year. As for the installation of machines, more than 30 machines allocated domestically have been installed. The UNRRA machines that have arrived in Guannei have been transferred from Shanghai and Kowloon to the factory. More than 200 units have been transported, and about 100 units have been installed. The rest are still being prepared. As for the power plant, a 750-kilowatt steam generator has been partially transported, and factory buildings are now being built to prepare power transmission poles. When the equipment is shipped by the end of the year, the power supply equipment can be completed. At present, the factory's power temporarily relies on a 75-kilowatt diesel generator. The factory's workforce has now increased to more than 200 people.</p>
<p>The Future of Zhuzhou Factory: Among the larger railway machinery factories in China, those in North China are difficult to exert their effectiveness due to the impact of banditry. South of the Yangtze River, except for Qishuyan, Zhuzhou Factory is the first to be recommended. Moreover, Zhuzhou Factory was established later, and the various machines are the most modern among the domestic railway machinery factories. In the future, the mission it will shoulder in the country will be the most important. Especially Zhuzhou is located on the bank of the Xiang River, at the intersection of the Yuehan, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Xiang-Qian railways. It reaches Zhejiang and Shanghai in the east, Guangdong and Hong Kong in the south, and is a land of fish and rice by the lake in the north. Across the river is Xiashesi, where the National Resources Commission plans the power center. Steel is taken from Daye, coal and coke rely on Pingxiang, and the manpower in Hunan is not lacking. Considering the geographical advantages, it is located in the heavy industry center of central and southern China, and the future development is unlimited. My country's locomotives have always relied on foreign imports. We hope to see Zhuzhou one day drive out self-made locomotives and run on various roads!</p>
<h3>Old and New Newspapers in Hong Kong: Two Forces Engaged in a Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>— By Shaozhong</p>
<p>[Hong Kong, 27th Dispatch] Hong Kong, a beautiful and moving land cherished by British gentlemen as a jewel in the crown of the British Empire, is now also a paradise for many adventurers from our country. Whether in the political, economic, or cultural spheres, dazzling and intense battles are unfolding. Indeed, the existence of various newspapers on this island demonstrates the intensity of the struggle. On each of these newspapers, the conflict between the new and the old, the left and the right, and democracy and totalitarianism is constantly unfolding.</p>
<p>Speaking of Hong Kong's journalistic circles, one cannot forget two newspapers representing the two major forces in the country: the Kuomintang Daily and the Huashang Bao. The former was founded by Kuomintang comrades overseas during the early days of the War of Resistance and has been published for many years. Renowned figures in Shanghai's cultural circles, such as Tao Baichuan, Chen Xunyu, and Wang Xinming, have all been responsible for the newspaper or presided over its editorials. The current director is the veteran journalist Pan Gongbi. This overseas party newspaper, with its historical significance, has been reorganized as a company since last year, struggling to survive. However, its position remains at the forefront of the Kuomintang's ideological struggle. At the same time, it is one of the most nationalistic newspapers in Hong Kong, repeatedly engaging in righteous and stern debates with the British government for the benefit of overseas Chinese, leaving a deep impression on them. The Huashang Bao is the organ of the Communist Party. Initially, it called for support from the perspective of the people. Later, its true colors were exposed, and it simply presented itself as Mao Zedong's mouthpiece, boasting and exaggerating. Previously, the heads of its editorial and management departments were Sa Kongliao and Liu Simu. Recently, Shao Zonghan, who was expelled from Singapore after running a newspaper there, has been reassigned to Hong Kong to oversee the redesign. The situation remains the same, and its position seems precarious.</p>
<p>In the newspaper arena, the Sing Tao, Wah Kiu Yat Po, and Hong Kong Commercial Daily are relatively less politically charged. These three are also among the older newspapers in the area. Wah Kiu Yat Po has the largest circulation and most pages. Sing Tao is the most outstanding representative of Aw Boon-Haw's Star Group newspapers, with more pages and a considerable readership in the Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Hong Kong Commercial Daily was founded by Sir Robert Hotung and has a relatively serious stance, reflecting the voices of Hong Kong's business community.</p>
<p>The two major newspapers published this year are Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po. The content of Ta Kung Pao is similar to its Shanghai edition, and it seems to have a tendency to continuously improve. Wen Wei Po still maintains its old style, unilaterally leaning into the embrace of the Communist Party. However, technically, it is somewhat immature. Whether in news or supplements, it unconsciously takes a vulgar path, perhaps to cater to Hong Kong's taste!</p>
<p>In addition, there are many daily and evening newspapers on the Hong Kong market with considerable circulation, which are purely yellow news. They remain stagnant in the stage of pornography and martial arts, a phenomenon that cannot be found in any other newspaper scene in the country. They often use Cantonese to write and report news, which is regarded as an indispensable "spiritual food" for ordinary citizens (including workers and women) during their leisure time. As for the upper-class Chinese living in the Mid-Levels and interacting with foreign friends, they use an English morning or evening newspaper as entertainment while having morning or afternoon tea. Perhaps their appreciation of Chinese is the same as that of the ordinary citizens mentioned earlier, being accustomed to the "Hong Kong-style" Chinese exemplified by phrases like "If you want to park, you can park here."</p>
<h3>Qing Dynasty Gold Seal Weighing 270 Taels</h3>
<p>Received Yesterday by the National Bank in Beiping</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping Reports] Yesterday, the National Bank in Beiping received a gold seal of Prince Yu of the Qing Dynasty, weighing 270 taels. It was held by his descendant, Jin Dongping. The seal is two inches high and three inches square. Next to the seal script "Seal of Prince Yu of the Qing Dynasty" are Manchu inscriptions. After cutting it open for identification, the composition is approximately 60%.</p>
<h3>Wu Huawen's Property in Bengbu Confiscated After Blindly Defecting to the Communists</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu Reports on the 24th] Wu Huawen, commander of the 84th Division of the Reorganized Army, who participated in the outer regiment battle of Jinan near Changqing, Shandong, suddenly defected this time. When the news came, people from all walks of life here paid special attention. During the enemy-puppet occupation of Bengbu, Wu served as the commander-in-chief of the puppet Third Front Army, with strong power and a long stay in Bengbu. Almost all the major traitors in Anhui province knew Wu, and his influence was prominent for a time, which was quite feared by the enemy. Last year, Wu firmly defended Yanzhou and made great achievements for his efforts in combat, deeply relied upon by the central government, and there were plans to promote him to a certain provisional army. This time, coercing a portion of officers and soldiers to blindly defect to the communists was beyond everyone's expectations.</p>
<p>Wu's old father, Wu Yiqi, has lived in Bengbu for a long time and looks very old. The reporter had met him once. During the enemy-puppet period, Wu Huawen occupied a property of the Zhang family south of the Tianqiao on Dama Road, covering an area of more than two acres. Wu Yiqi and his eldest daughter (Wu Huawen's elder sister) and others often lived in the residence. A few days ago, Wu sent someone to Bengbu, saying that his mother was ill in Jinan, and soon took his old father to Jinan to live with her. Before half a month had passed, news of Wu's defection came. It is unknown whether his parents had moved in advance in Jinan. Now that Wu has been wanted, his property in Bengbu will be confiscated in the near future. A part of his residence is borrowed by Wu's relatives, and a part is occupied by the garrison.</p>
<p>Wu is only forty-six years old this year. In his early years, he joined Feng Yuxiang's army as a primary school graduate and was later recommended to Baoding Military Academy as a student of the regimental school. He once served as the commander of the pistol brigade under Han Fuju. He is fickle and has the traditional style of Feng and Han. His deputy division commander, Ta Tuan-yi, was originally Wu's chief of staff, following Wu for many years. He is sixty-eight years old this year and was born as a scholar in the late Qing Dynasty.</p>
<h3>Good News from Northern Jiangsu Cotton Production</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Cong Yongshu</p>
<p>[Our Reporter in Nantong Reports on the 24th] Northern Jiangsu, close to the textile industrial areas of southern Jiangsu, is a vast cotton-producing area. The reporter is delighted to report: "Northern Jiangsu's cotton production has increased again this year!"</p>
<p>According to accurate estimates, this year's cotton production in northern Jiangsu is about 1.2 million dan, an increase of more than 200,000 dan compared to last year. The distribution of production areas is roughly as follows: Nantong 385,000 dan, Haimen 145,000 dan, Qidong 104,000 dan, Funing 138,000 dan, Yancheng 41,000 dan, Dongtai 219,000 dan, Xinghua 14,000 dan, and Rugao 116,000 dan. The total cotton planting area reaches 4,146,000 mu, accounting for approximately 55% of the total cotton planting area in Jiangsu Province. (According to the cotton field estimates jointly announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee and the National Textile Industry Federation this year, Jiangsu Province has 7,594,000 mu.) However, this number does not include the entire cotton fields in northern Jiangsu. The eastern half of northern Jiangsu, let's call it Sudong, (the division military region established here by the Jiangsu Military Control District is called the Sudong Division Military Region) is the central area of cotton production. Especially the salt reclamation area along the coast, which is almost entirely cotton fields. To understand the area figures in this area, we went back to the investigation reports of the early Republic of China: from the Yangtze River in the south to Chenjiagang in Lianshui in the north, from the Fangong Dike in the west to the coast in the east, it is 500 li long from north to south and about 200 li wide from east to west, with an area of about 11,000 square kilometers, equivalent to 16,540,000 mu of land. Along the coast, the sea gradually recedes eastward, and the beach land extends eastward, and the newly silted land increases every year. The fastest rate is 1.6 kilometers per year. If we include the newly expanded beach land of more than 30 years, this reclamation area should have at least 20,000,000 mu. Less than half of it has been reclaimed, and the mature cotton fields are only slightly more than half of the reclaimed land, estimated at more than 5,660,000 mu, which is not a small number. We know that the rural areas of northern Jiangsu have suffered successively from the enemy-puppet's ravages, and then suffered from the destruction of the bandit army. Now, they are gradually waking up from the bandit atmosphere, which is obviously a kind of progress.</p>
<p>The cotton-producing area in northern Jiangsu is large, and the soil is different, so the cotton varieties are very complex. Generally speaking, American cotton is suitable for planting in the salt reclamation area, while Chinese cotton is suitable for planting along the Yangtze River. Different cotton varieties also have very different fiber lengths, ranging from 13/16 inches to only 1/2 inch. The "Tuo" American cotton that used to be planted in this area has now torn up its golden signboard and replaced it with a new name called "Degenerated Foreign Cotton." This kind of American cotton was initially very popular among farmers, but for more than ten years, due to poor management, improper cultivation, and mixing with Chinese cotton, the quality has deteriorated, and the fiber length is only 13/16 inches, and the ginning outturn is only 31%. That is, 100 jin of seed cotton can only be ginned into 31 jin of lint.</p>
<h3>Evil Practice of Collecting "Chicken Grain" in Qimen for Rent</h3>
<p>Tenant Farmers Appeal for Prohibition</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Huizhou Reports on the 27th] "Chicken Grain" is an evil practice planted by landlords in Qimen. According to tenant farmers, the creator was a powerful family surnamed in Xijie, the city center, who had produced many great figures in the past. The accumulation of property was naturally very rich, and they were also one of the largest landlords in Qimen at that time. Every year during the autumn harvest, its descendants would go to the countryside to supervise the collection of rent grain from tenant farmers. In order to cultivate their land, the tenant farmers always had to kill chickens and offer wine as a treat, and they did not dare to neglect them at all. When the master saw the chickens and ducks raised by the tenant farmers' families, he could not help but show envy. In order to win the master's pleasure, the tenant farmers had to give one or two chickens to the master to take back, and this became a common practice. Every year when supervising the rent collection, they would routinely ask the tenant farmers for chickens. When the tenant farmers' families did not raise chickens, they were afraid of offending the master, so they had to replace the chicken with grain of equivalent value. Over time, this became a habit, and the evil practice of collecting "chicken grain" along with the rent was started.</p>
<p>In recent years, although the family of a certain surname has declined, they still want the chicken grain from the tenant farmers. There are also quite a few other landlords who demand chicken grain according to the example. Now, Wang Renyan and others from Sanli Street Bao in the county have sent a letter to Huibao, appealing for the tenant farmers, hoping that the authorities will quickly eliminate the remnants of feudalism and liberate the tenant farmers. Knowledgeable tenant farmers in the countryside will also follow up with a joint request to the county government to severely ban this practice, so that this evil practice will no longer harm the people.</p>
<h3>Two Tragic Cases in Yixing: Wife Raped in the Dark of Night, Husband Killed Under a Kitchen Knife, Authorities Have Obtained Considerable Clues to the Perpetrators</h3>
<p>Old Man Beats Daughter-in-Law to Death with a Carrying Pole, Corpse Cut into Eighteen Pieces</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Yixing Reports on the 28th] The area of Guagong Mountain in Fangqiao is remote and desolate. Liu Yousheng, a resident of Jiangsi Bridge, built a thatched cottage here because of his poor family and watched over the Taoyuan taro for people, and his family lived a hard life. At about 10 p.m. on the 27th of this month, Liu Yousheng was suddenly awakened from his sleep by the sound of pushing the door open, and he lit a lamp and got up to ask who it was. The answer from outside the door was "　Tingzhen Self-Defense Force," asking for a guide because they were not familiar with the road. Before he finished speaking, they had already broken the door and entered, extinguished the fire held by Liu, ordered him not to make a sound, and tied him with a rope outside the door. Seven people came in total, one watching the door outside, and the other six went straight to Liu's wife's room, forcibly took off all of Liu's wife's small clothes, pressed her down on the bed, and raped her in turn. Although Liu's wife struggled and cried, because the place was not close to the village, she could not get any help even if she called for help. At this time, Liu Yousheng, who was tied up outside the door, heard the sound and tried desperately to escape, but the rope was strong and did not allow him to struggle. He had no choice but to shout loudly, telling his wife that it was better to die than to lose her chastity, and warning the perpetrators that they were acquaintances, so why bother to force each other like this? The perpetrators, hearing these words, in order to avoid accidents in the future, had murderous intentions, and with the thought of "doing it once and for all," they found a kitchen knife in the dark, dragged Yousheng to the road, cut off his throat and killed him. Before leaving, they looted 2 million legal tender and a piece of soap. The head of the Baojia reported to the township office, which transferred the case to the county court to send personnel to investigate. After the case occurred, Chief Feng has obtained considerable clues and it is not difficult to solve the case immediately.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Yixing Reports on the 27th] Wu Baozhi, a resident of Tangjia Village, Yongfeng Township, Zhangzhu District, has a wife, Song, and five sons. The eldest son, Shunqing, is twenty years old. Since childhood, he has been engaged to Lu Wu Mao, the daughter of Lu Yunxian of Yanshan Township in the district, as a child bride. They have been married for three years and have a deep affection for each other. However, the parents-in-law were unusually fierce and often abused Lu Wu Mao. The day before yesterday evening, because there was no water in the water tank, Wu Baozhi scolded her and beat her with a carrying pole, hitting Lu Wu Mao's waist. At that time, Lu Wu Mao laughed wildly, and Wu Baozhi, thinking that she was still laughing, hit her again with the carrying pole, and Lu Wu Mao immediately died. Wu Baozhi knew that he had caused trouble and committed murder, and was so anxious that he did not know what to do. He immediately called Zhu Ligong, a villager, to come to his house to discuss. They decided to move the body and destroy the evidence, so they chopped Lu Wu Mao's body into eighteen pieces with a kitchen knife, packed them into three urns, and buried them at the foot of Meizi Mountain nearby at night, and gave Zhu Ligong two dou of white rice, instructing him not to make a sound. The next day, Wu Baozhi instead asked Lu Yunxian for his daughter-in-law, and Lu Yunxian euphemistically persuaded him to help find her. Two days later, although Lu Yunxian learned about the situation, he did not understand the inside story, so he immediately reported to the resident self-defense team leader and director of the Fenghuangke Office, Chen Yinfa. After receiving the report, he summoned them separately for questioning, but there were no clues. He then summoned Wu Baozhi's nine-year-old youngest son, Wu Xiaogou, and questioned him in detail. Wu Xiaogou confessed everything that had happened. Then Wu Baozhi was summoned again. Zhu Ligong confronted each other. At this point, Wu and Zhu had no way to deny it and admitted it frankly. They were then escorted to the foot of Meizi Mountain to unearth the three urns of Lu Wu Mao's chopped body. According to the information, they requested the court, and the prosecutor Han Yongling, together with the forensic official Shen Zhigao, moved the corpse urns to Xushe Town for examination. For a time, the crowd gathered, and everyone believed it was a tragic and inhuman event. More than eighty of Lu Yunxian's fellow villagers (from Hunan) knelt on the ground and asked Prosecutor Han to seek justice. In addition to comforting them separately, Prosecutor Han took Wu Baozhi and Zhu Ligong into custody for legal action.</p>
<h3>Shi Zhongxiang, Head of the Puppet Jiading Detective Team, Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Suzhou Reports on the 30th] Shi Zhongxiang, head of the puppet Jiading County Detective Team, hid in Shanghai after the victory and opened a Xiangfa repair shop. Recently, the victim learned of this and reported it to the Jiangsu High Procuratorate. After repeated summons and investigations, he was indicted for committing a crime.</p>

<h3>Production Area Prices Are High, Dealers Are Hesitant: Food Rice Transactions Are Sparse, Miscellaneous Grains Are Scarce and Expensive, and the Oil Market Is Rising</h3>
<p>Food rice transactions are few and far between. Due to high prices in the production areas, dealers have stopped. Arrivals are scarce. Yesterday, the South City arrived with 577 shi and 5 dou, and the North City had 523 shi, so the supply is extremely small. The prices reported in the market are mostly not open. The South City opened 220 shi of red coarse indica rice, priced at 17 yuan per bag. Other openings are few. The North City's transactions are bleak, the same as the South City. There are no rice samples on the market sample table, and the industry closes early.</p>
<p>Flour transactions are still mediocre. Because the retail supply of raw materials is almost exhausted, it can only maintain the allocated flour and cannot supply the market. Wholesalers have no supply. The bran factory has no supply and no allocation, and transactions are completely stopped.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains are firm and expensive without goods, which makes transactions even more sluggish. Sales of soybeans are few, and there are many people who are unable to purchase. Corn is not easy to buy in large quantities, and sorghum is not sold, waiting for the price to be negotiated and approved at a good price. After the sale of buckwheat, there are no samples, and the trend is favorable. Mung beans and broad beans do not appear. Sesame is high and chic, followed by weak. Raw peanuts have a few openings.</p>
<p>Edible oil rises slowly, and the trend is stable. Bean oil factories have daily supply. Yesterday, Datong Factory opened at 51.40, and Zhongzhi at 51.00. Spot prices are mostly 51 yuan, so it is up more than one yuan. Shengcai oil from Dade Xin Factory is expensive and scarce, and is opened at a limited price. There is not much glory or disgrace for hot rapeseed oil. Sesame oil is flat. Raw oil stations have limited prices. Soybean cake has no supply at all, and there are no transactions for the first time.</p>
<h3>Keemun Black Tea Sales Are Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign tea market, exporting merchants' enthusiasm for Keemun black tea and Tunlu green tea remained high, but the holders still believed that the raw tea in the production area was strong, and they were all thinking about holding on, and most were unwilling to sell lightly, so the transactions continued to be narrow, and the situation was more stable.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, the tea merchants are unusually optimistic recently because of the extraordinary demand for tea overseas. Unfortunately, this year's production is not abundant, which makes it difficult for exports to become smooth, and it is predicted that the future will still have a trend of continuous brilliance. As for domestic tea, acceptance is even, and there is a lack of lightness.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was another saying that sugar would be released for export, and because Taiwan Sugar Company claimed that the allocated price for this period would increase, the public's sentiment once again became favorable, and there was more sucking up by people in the industry with loose funds and many useless orders, and the market was firm and chic. The 20th-period Taiwan red stock sheet saw a rise immediately after opening, circling in the middle, and the market slightly increased at the close. Xinghua red had a slightly softer market due to more selling and a sharp reduction in acceptance, while the rest saw an uptrend.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Restricts Remittances</h3>
<p>The Four Joint Offices Relay Instructions to Operating Bureaus</p>
<p>The Guangzhou District Economic Supervisory Office, in order to curb the black market for Hong Kong remittances, issued an emergency order to local public and private banks, stipulating three measures to restrict inward remittances: (1) Reiterate the previous order that no bank shall handle Hong Kong remittances. Violators will be ordered to suspend business and will be severely punished according to law. (2) The total amount of local remittances paid by all banks in Guangzhou City each day, including remittances purchased, shall not exceed 200,000 gold yuan. Each transaction shall not exceed 500 gold yuan. Violators will be ordered to suspend business. (3) If there is a legitimate use for a remittance exceeding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the reasons must be detailed and submitted to the Guangzhou Branch of the Central Bank for approval before it can be handled. The above measures have been notified to the Four Joint Offices by the Ministry of Finance, which relayed the instructions to the National Banks for compliance.</p>
<h3>Overdrafts and Bounced Checks Will Be Investigated According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Financial Control Bureau recently received an interpretation from the Ministry of Finance: If the checks issued by the clients of the banks are found by the check clearing house to be bounced due to insufficient deposits and excessive overdrafts, they should be immediately intercepted, and the banks should report to the court for investigation and prosecution according to law, and the banks shall be responsible for providing evidence. If the bank provides evidence to the Financial Control Bureau, the bureau may also directly transfer it to the court for investigation and prosecution. As for the point that customers are allowed to be exempted from sanctions for suspending transactions if the returned checks are caused by delayed delivery or defective goods, if the bank can provide the bureau with conclusive evidence that the customer has stopped payment, and the bureau verifies that it is true, it can be exempted from sanctions. The Financial Control Bureau has issued separate orders to the banking, money lending, and trust industries and the check clearing house for compliance.</p>
<h3>Early Repayment of Public Bonds Will Begin Today</h3>

It is instructed that the managing bank should start making payments from October 1, 37, and should be handled in accordance with the instructions.</p>
<h3>Non-Quota Import Goods: Foreign Exchange Will Still Be Allocated Discretionally in the Future</h3>
<p>According to news from the Export-Import Management Committee, the examination of non-quota import goods listed in Schedules (1) and (3)A of the import trade regulations has been suspended since the implementation of the new economic policy. The reporter, considering that the import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters have been reduced after verification, the import volume of various raw materials will inevitably decrease, and whether production equipment can still be applied for import has been a matter of concern to all parties. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter inquired about this matter with a person in charge of the committee. It was said that regarding the foreign exchange issue of goods in Schedules (1) and (3)A, the committee has recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan that foreign exchange will still be approved and allocated discretionally in the future, depending on actual needs. In addition, as the application forms for this type of goods were previously sent to the responsible departments of the Examination Division, making the examination work difficult, it has been decided that from today (October 1st), all designated banks, when forwarding application forms for Schedule (1) and Schedule (3)A goods, must send them to the Fourth Section of the Non-Quota Examination Division for collection and forwarding to the responsible departments, in order to facilitate the examination work.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Generally Rises to the Limit; Cloth Prices Continued to Rise Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened with a mediocre tone in the morning, but then, because various parties still intended to purchase, the market's silver supply was still abundant, and the industry's funds were ample, people purchased as soon as they saw sales in the market. The yarn sold by the Shenxin Factory on the previous day was completely sold out, and the buying sentiment in the market was strong. There was a shortage of 16-count yarn. Yesterday, the Wing On Factory only sold 10-count Jiahe, 32-count Jincheng, 42-count Jincheng, 42-count double-strand Jincheng, and 60-count double-strand Jincheng. The Fangjian Company also opened 20-count Hongkui, Hongshuangji, Cai Kexing, Xiangfeng, and Wuzi Jiushi brands, totaling 700 pieces, with the price still at 700 yuan. Throughout the day, the supply of fine yarn of various counts was very scarce, and the weaving industry was eager to purchase it, so the price rose to the limit. 21-count Shuangma yarn was still sold for 783 yuan, trading at the limit. The supply and demand of 20-count yarn were equal, 16-count was stable, and the trend of 10-count coarse yarn was not bad, with prices reaching the limit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to rise in price, and the market showed excess demand. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened with a slight drop of one corner, but then gradually rose to a high of 28 yuan and 6 corners. The prices of other cloths also rose close to the limit. Subsequently, the chairman of the industry association made a public statement, saying: "The cotton cloth registration procedures have been completed, but in the future, regardless of buying or selling, applications must be submitted to prevent the escape of goods and eliminate speculation and manipulation." He also advised his colleagues not to only target Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan Bijie as trading objects. Subsequently, the directors and supervisors sold more than 400 pieces of Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan Bijie in public, and the market situation stabilized. In the end, Longtou fine cloth closed at 28 yuan, up 4 corners from the previous day. Longtou B-character, Wufu Laba Tong, and Sijunzi Yuan Bijie, etc., had fluctuations of 1 corner to 3 or 4 corners, but colored cloth Shilin cloth was still stable. The buying sentiment in the market was strong, and there were not many sales. Although the Fangjian Company opened sales, the market was still strong. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,200 pieces.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Registration Completed</p>
<p>In other news: The cotton cloth registration was completed on schedule yesterday, totaling 1,465,267 pieces, 521,083 sections, and 175,508 yards, 2,402 meters, 16,162 pounds, and 839 bed sheets, equivalent to a quota of 2 million pieces.

In addition, from September 27th to yesterday, the total amount of yarn and cloth sold separately by various factories for four days was equivalent to 1,385 pieces of 20-count yarn and 53,200 pieces of cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Allowed to Decline</p>
<p>Due to the limited price trading of raw cotton, there is rarely any opening business. The source of supply from the production areas has virtually stopped, and transactions within the industry are neither entering nor exiting. The market situation is cold, and transactions are scarce. Zhoupu seed cotton is still at the limit price, with few transactions. There are prices for other cotton, but no goods.</p>
<h3>Rayon Firm</h3>
<p>The rayon market yesterday was still cold, but because of the ban on carrying it out of the country, retail sales on this street have slightly decreased. However, the inventory is thin, and the industry is very worried. Furthermore, due to the abundance of silver in the market, there are very few spot sales of late goods. The trend is firm in the middle, forming a stalemate in trading, and the market situation has turned dull. Miscellaneous brands had some sporadic transactions at the limit.</p>

<h3>On Handling Handover</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>Dongfang Jun discussed the absurdity, unreasonableness, and falsification methods of reimbursement in various institutions a few days ago. The reimbursement of institutions is once a month. The inside story of the handover of new and old in the institutions is also quite a bit. Because of what Dongfang Jun said about reimbursement, I also interspersed to talk about the handover.</p>
<p>An official of an institution, in order to be promoted, transferred, or dismissed, has to handle the handover. In the old-style institutions' expenses, many are package-style, such as the county yamen of the former Qing Dynasty. When the county magistrate leaves office, the handover only involves seals and some archives and files. Other things such as office chairs, tables, and stationery are taken away, sold, or transferred to the successor for a price. Some even destroy stoves, windows, and doors, so that the successor has to repair them again. The files of special cases are often hidden and refused to be handed over. The account books of money, grain, and land are also made a mess. Therefore, the person receiving is easily fooled if he is not an insider. Because after the handover between the new and old officeholders, there is a routine joint report to the superior authority that the handover is clear. In this way, even if incomplete and untrue files, account books, and funds are discovered later, there is no way to pursue them anymore. You can only admit bad luck and try to remedy it.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the handover of an institution takes as little as ten days and as long as ten months. The staff handling the handover are either current staff members of the institution, staff members who leave with the departing official, or dismissed staff members, who are busy burying their heads in handling the handover list like handling reimbursement.</p>
<p>Before an institution is about to handle the handover, in addition to the personnel department compiling a list of staff, public servants, and affiliated workers, the busiest are the general affairs, accounting, disbursement, and material management personnel. Handling the handover in large institutions in big cities is one set of methods, and handling the handover in small institutions in the interior is another set of methods. But no matter what, there is mostly corruption. For example, public property is replaced by old ones with new ones, and bad ones with good ones. This is the most common thing. For example, electric fans, bicycles, typewriters, sofas, and even cars, they can use the most dilapidated old things to replace the new and good ones used daily in the institution. Other things such as writing chairs, desks, stationery, etc., need not be mentioned. It is said that after a certain person resigned from the Minister of the Northern Government ten years ago, the stationery and envelopes he used were still printed with the name of a certain department. Since stationery and envelopes are hidden carefully, other cultural relics can also be imagined.</p>
<p>The outgoing official handling the handover must pre-use the seal to cover dozens of blank official note papers, in preparation for future applications. These pre-sealed note papers can sometimes be sold for money. For example, if someone needs a certificate, he can fill it out at any time. With the majestic official seal, who dares to say no. This kind of play is the most important thing in handling the handover. Even a clean and honest official must have this move for pre-sealed note papers, in preparation for any possible needs.</p>
<p>Those handling the handover must be insiders, and those receiving the handover must also be insiders. If both parties are outsiders, or one party is an outsider, then the degree of loss for the outsider cannot be described in any words. If it is not handled well, you can be liable for losses in a small way, investigated in a moderate way, and even be in danger of your life in a serious way. In a word, it is a trick for both parties to see whose technique is skillful and the patching is proper. This is being an official, this is public affairs.</p>
<h3>Mosquito-Repelling Color</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Mosquitoes seem to have the ability to distinguish colors. If the color of your clothes is black, blue, or red, then mosquitoes will definitely swarm and come to regard your blood as their delicacy. Because, entomologists have discovered that mosquitoes are particularly fond of these colors.</p>
<p>The colors that mosquitoes dislike the most are white and yellow. If you want to avoid mosquito harassment, you'd better wear white and yellow clothes.</p>
<p>These words are not baseless empty talk. In the place with the most mosquitoes in Oregon, USA, scientists have conducted careful experiments. They called seven people, wearing seven different colors of clothes, dedicated to mosquitoes' attacks, and entomologists quietly observed. In half a minute, 1,499 mosquitoes flew to the black clothes, while in the same period, there were only 520 mosquitoes on the white clothes.</p>
<h3>Psychological Effect</h3>
<p>— Fei Yu</p>
<p>There is a so-called "pre-existing state" in abnormal psychology. What we usually call the "psychological effect" is entirely caused by the "pre-existing state." We think we have a headache, and as a result, the head really starts to hurt. When we are walking, once we think that we have walked dozens of miles and the body is extremely tired, our feet become so heavy that we can't lift them up, and we can't walk any further. In short, as long as we have a stubborn wrong idea, our actions will often be affected by it.</p>
<p>Many disabilities are caused by the "pre-existing state." An old woman thought she had hemiplegia. Her left half of her body was completely numb when she was awake, and she had no sensation at all. But when she was asleep, someone twisted her left half of her body. She would immediately say: "Thief, you hurt me." From this, it can be seen that the sensation in her left half of her body has not been lost. Later, a psychologist thought of many ways to break her concept of self-confident hemiplegia, and the sensation in her left half of her body was restored.</p>
<p>The following example can be regarded as the strangest. A young military officer who had sleepwalking was discharged from the military due to hemiplegia after being injured. His lower body was unable to move at all. One night, he had a dream that his mother-in-law was going to rob his son. So in his dream, he jumped out of bed, picked up the pillow on the bed as his son, and ran out of his bedroom. The family was awakened by him and hurried to chase him. Who knew he ran extremely fast, and in a flash, he ran to the patio outside the house, then climbed a tap water pipe and climbed to the roof of the three-story building, still holding the pillow in his hand. Others could not climb up, so they had to go up the stairs behind the house and stop him and wake him up. Who knew that as soon as he woke up, he immediately threw the pillow and fell to the ground, and then his lower body could not move again.</p>
<h3>Close Sentences in the Depths of the Clouds</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>I have an appointment with Weishu, Fanmu and other friends to watch the moon in West Lake in Mid-Autumn Festival. However, Yuanweng returned to Beijing for official business, and Yu Ran was stuck in Shanghai due to illness. In the end, only Sanmu accompanied me. Miscellaneous sentences record the journey.</p>
<p>Thinking back to this trip twenty years ago, the mountain scenery on the way connects to Linping, the rest of my life is unharmed, and the sights of rice and hemp are tied to my emotions. (Impromptu in the car)</p>
<p>The sound of the horn urged the monk and guest out of bed, setting off from Nanping towards the water at dawn. The autumn mist adds to Dong Saiye, and the distant autumn colors are full of red freshness. (Lotus flowers are very abundant)</p>
<p>The color of the first sun on the mountain is bright, and a dike divides the Ming Lake. The wind on the six bridges is light and no one notices it, and the sound of planting canes can be heard in the silence. (Before dawn, I accompanied Sanmu out of Jing Temple and walked on Su Causeway)</p>
<p>The Zhenji Temple stands high above, with mountains rising and falling at its foot. The mountain monk's temple retains heroic spirit, but gathers its strange emotions in the Sleeping Buddha Hall. (The abbot of Zhenji Temple, Master Xuchu, led the tour into the mountains that day, and the master presided over intelligence work in one area during the Anti-Japanese War.)</p>
<p>I stayed overnight on the first mountain of West Lake, and the bright moon in my dream became stingy. The morning clouds obscured the mountain path, but I still saw the mountain responding to itself. (Mid-Autumn Festival at Wuyun Mountain, no moon was seen. I went down the mountain in the heavy fog the next morning)</p>
<p>The pagoda stands quietly by the water, and the long bridge reappears, lying new on the waves. The mountains west of the river are self-going, and I leave my cane behind, leaving a person standing alone. (Looking at the mountains of Xixing from the Qianjiang Bridge below the Liuhe Pagoda)</p>
<p>The lotus pickers have left and the monks have come, and the moon is opening the oars in the heart of the lake. My heart is as calm as this water, and the mountains are facing each other with each Cui Kun. (Happy View Master Yueyou Night Lake Subnight Party Return)</p>
<h3>Medical Record</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>I had a fever for a few days. Seeing that the situation was serious, I couldn't bear it any longer. I had to pick a church hospital to seek medical treatment, because this hospital could spend less money.</p>
<p>The hospital is closed on Sundays. This is probably God's will: the Sabbath should be rested and not allowed to work. So the doctor stops working, the nurse stops working, and the disease must stop working.</p>
<p>Waiting until Sunday afternoon, I hired a rickshaw to the hospital. When I arrived at the gate of the hospital, I saw that the iron gate was tightly closed, and many patients were waiting outside the door. Some were standing, and some were sitting on the terrazzo floor. The sign hanging in front of the gate said that the outpatient clinic was from 9:00 to 11:00, but now it was only 8:00.</p>
<p>I couldn't stand, so I had to sit on the terrazzo floor. The autumn wind blew the French parasol trees rustling, and the cold that brought in penetrated straight into the bones.</p>
<p>At half past eight, the iron gate finally opened, and the patients rushed in to get ahead. When I arrived at the registration room, I lined up at the back of the queue, but I wanted to vomit again and again, and my head was dizzy.</p>
<p>The registration was done by a nurse. I guessed that she must still be an old maid, with a gaunt face, a thin figure, and arrogant eyes. She sat high up, interrogating the patients. With a cold tone, she seemed to be full of unhappiness.</p>
<p>"What's your name?" the old maid was asking for a confession.</p>
<p>"Surname... surname Wang..." the countryman stammered.</p>
<p>"How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Four... forty-five years old."</p>
<p>"Which department are you seeing?"</p>
<p>"Which fruit? I don't know."</p>
<p>"You don't even know which department you want to see! Is it internal medicine or surgery?"</p>
<p>The countryman was dumbfounded by this, and the old maid was even more furious, and scolded with a sharp throat:</p>
<p>"Asking you, outsider!"</p>
<p>Fortunately, the patient behind this countryman came to the rescue, asked this countryman where he felt uncomfortable, and then respectfully reported to the old maid.</p>
<p>Having experienced this mocking formation, when it was my turn, I obediently and automatically reported my name, age, and that I wanted to see "internal medicine," and I was not scolded.</p>
<p>After half an hour, I was called into the consultation room. The doctor gave me a lightning diagnosis at a high speed of two minutes and prescribed a prescription. I took this prescription to the pharmacy and squeezed out a bottle of medicine water like squeezing out a household registration.</p>
<p>After all, the bones of the poor are cheap, and my illness was actually cured at once. Probably this is the miracle performed by the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>Amen!</p>
<h3>Snow Studies Rouling</h3>
<p>Most of the warlords in the past did not die well, such as Zhang Zuolin who died from the Japanese bombing, Sun Chuanfang who died from Ms. Shi's gun; Zhang Zongchang was sniped by Zheng Xiaojiang, and Xu Shuzheng was intercepted and killed by Lu Chengwu, all ending with a pistol. These people have killed many people! And bombs and gun handles are also things they usually use. It is not surprising that those who play with water die in water, and those who play with fire die in fire. Only Feng Yuxiang's death by cremation, and in a foreign travel wheel movie theater, is very unique. A friend talked about Feng's former military power, killing people without using ordinary punishment. For example, in Henan in the sixteenth year, he "buried alive" the military leader of the Feng army, Tian Weiqin, to death, which is one example. "Buried alive" and "burned to death" are both illegal penalties, often used by savages and bandits, heretics, and village fools for vendettas. Feng's strange death, is it regarded as retribution by karma scholars?</p>
<p>Electric fire is different from ordinary fire, and ships are different from land. Since the fire has started, why only Feng died? (In addition, a daughter was also killed, which is also unreasonable.) After burning Feng, why did this wheel safely drive forward to Aoxport? How strange this fire is, it is only to send "General Christ to heaven"? It is also said that Feng likes to make movies himself, but his technology is unfamiliar and he accidentally started a fire. Is it true or not? There is no way to verify it. Moreover, the ship he was on was "Old Su's" ship. Old Su was originally a mysterious country, playing the "Mystery of Life and Death." In 1945, Germany was defeated, and Hitler's whereabouts were unknown. There were various suspicions of life and death, all stemming from the Soviet general's repeated denial of Hitler's death. Another example is what is the use of taking Puyi to that country? Where is he held? Is he treated well or abused? The saying is different. He is truly good at playing the "hide-and-seek" game.</p>
<h3>Reminiscence of Wu Qingyuan</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>The newspaper on September 27th reported a New Asia News Agency Tokyo dispatch on the 26th: "The Go match between Japanese Go master Honinbo and Wu Qingyuan has now progressed to the third game (a total of ten games). Wu won the first two games. As of the fifty-ninth move of the third game, the outcome has also been determined, and Mr. Wu is again hopeful of victory. According to the rules of Go, if Honinbo loses four consecutive games out of ten, he will be deemed defeated. Therefore, Honinbo cannot but go all out for the third and fourth games. If Honinbo fails, then the other Japanese eighth-dan Go players are certainly no match for Mr. Wu." After reading the above telegram, it happened that a Go friend in the old capital saw an article I wrote about "Wu Qingyuan" in Free Talk, and recently sent a letter to inform me of anecdotes about Qingyuan after he went to the East, including extremely valuable information, so I wrote this article.</p>
<p>The first game in Tokyo for Qingzhou was against Mr. Katsuhara, and he won. Later, he played with Mr. Kojima, Mr. Hasegawa, Mr. Fukuda, Mr. Hayashi and others, winning ten and losing three in thirteen games. His layout was cautious, guarding firmly and attacking sharply, and he was always victorious. Moreover, he was quick-witted and moved very fast. The opponent's masters often pondered, while Qingyuan picked it up at hand, with only a little thought. Therefore, the name of genius shook the three islands. Newspapers and Go institute magazines all competed to praise him, and he was given the honorary title of "Invincible Black Go in the World". Japanese fifth-dan and sixth-dan have been defeated by the Chinese Go boy (at that time, Qingyuan was fifteen years old and had not yet joined Japanese nationality), so the celebrities did not dare to easily go out. At that time, there was Inagaki in Osaka, a seventy-three-year-old man, who was a famous seventh-dan in Japan. Seeing that his colleagues were afraid of Qingyuan, he went to Tokyo to fight. Unfortunately, the result was a big defeat of thirteen sons. What is noteworthy is that Qingyuan was only fifteen years old at that time, and his victory over Japanese masters was his inherent talent and Go skills, not because he had studied Japanese Go for many years.</p>
<p>The Japanese Go Institute has two major competitions every year in spring and autumn. Qingyuan came to Japan at the age of fifteen (Showa four years), and participated in the Go Institute competition in the second year, winning the first prize four times in a row, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Japanese Go saint Shusaku entered the first dan at the age of eleven and entered the sixth dan at the age of twenty. Qingyuan had the first dan Go skills at the age of thirteen and entered the fifth dan at the age of nineteen. Therefore, the Japanese compared him to their country's Go saint Shusaku.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Official Documents Long Distance Travel Sparrow's Nest How Can It Be Occupied For Long</h3>
<p>Gao Kun asks: For 30 years, my father has rented two floors of buildings to a Hua surname resident, with a contract stipulating three years. After the expiration, the Hua surname used the excuse that it was difficult to find a house and renewed the lease for six months. Unexpectedly, after the expiration, he refused to move out. My father had no choice but to sue in court, and the court ruled that he should move out of the house, but the defendant appealed and was rejected, and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court, which ruled to send it back for retrial. The defendant used the appeal and judgment period to delay the time, neither paying rent nor living in the house for a long time, which is tantamount to occupation. May I ask (1) How long does it take for the Nanjing Supreme Court to make a judgment in an ordinary case? (2) If the court does not make a judgment to move out for a long time, is it illegal for the plaintiff to move in? (3) How should the defendant's arrears of room money be calculated?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) There is no time limit stipulated by law, and it is difficult to predict how long it will take in fact. (2) In the case of a removal case that is in litigation and has not yet been determined by final judgment, the plaintiff cannot directly move in. Otherwise, it should constitute a crime of obstructing freedom. (3) How to calculate the rent arrears should be determined by local conditions and mutual agreement.</p>
