<h3>總統電勉各省市首長　掃除積習深入基層　加強剿匪戡亂工作力求政治有效改進　趁豫東勝利之機加倍振奮</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕蔣總統頃電各省市政府主席，市長，勗勉加强剿匪戡亂工作，趁此豫東勝利之機，加倍振奮，力求政治上之有效改進，掃除積習，脚踏實地，以赴事功。茲誌總統原電如次：</p>
<p>查剿匪戡亂首賴動員人民之全力，必須一切政治揹施適合人民之需要，構成整個之力量，內足以淸奸宄，使散匪無立足之餘地，外足以禦侵凌，使殘匪無裏掠之可能，則總體戰之建制已成，斯軍事上之勝券可必。蓋共匪一貫之作風，要以欺騙民衆，煽惑靑年爲其最毒辣之伎倆；若專就武力而論，則始終僅屬烏合之衆，避實就虛，擇隙流竄，純爲求食求兵，擴張惡勢，從不敢與國軍作決定性之戰鬥，直至此次河南戰役在共匪企圖滿以爲準備已久，羽毛已鹽，宜可問鼎中原，乃於上月糾合其陳毅，劉伯承，陳賡等匪之頑强主力，聚衆約三十萬，乘我開封守軍單薄，突行侵陷，及我馳援克復，遂又竄集睢縣，杞縣，通許一帶，封豕長蛇，負隅結陣，冀與國軍一決雌雄，藉圖逞志；乃經我在豫之陸空將士聯合掃蕩，東西鉗攻，上下射擊，此龐大悍匪，不過句日之間，即吿土崩瓦解，被殲十萬以上，陳劉匪首，各率殘餘，抱頭分潰。經此一役之後，共匪武力實屬脆弱，其不能與國軍抗衡，業已充分證明，所望各省市地方各級行政負責長官，趁此軍事勝利之機，加倍振奮，力求政治上之有效改進，首應掃除以耳代目之積習，脚踏實地，深入基層，所有省府主席委負與各廳處長，均應分區分期親至各縣，爲有計劃之巡視，行政督察專員及各縣縣畏，與縣府主管人員，則應按月分赴各鄕村爲有目標之工作督導，隨時隨地，指示辦法，解決問題，檢舉貪凟，申明賞罰，使上下之情澈底貫通，法令之扜格自可圓轉，人民之痛苦自可减少，政治效率之提高　於是，民心對於政府之向背亦繋於是。</p>
<h3>組訓地方武力　必須逐層督責　決不可上朦下混敷衍故事</h3>
<p>其次，省保安團，縣自衛隊，以及鄉鎭保甲之組訓，實爲省縣地方勦匪防匪之基本力量，必須逐層督責，依照規定，認眞整理，決不可再如過去上下膝混敷衍故事，尤應激勵各地正紳，督導退役軍官，協助民衆組訓，盡力桑梓自衛，運用地方集體之武力，勦除成股之小匪，以制其坐大；加强民衆保甲之組織，淸除潛伏之匪黨，以絕其內應。須知各地人民，莫不切齒共匪之殘暴，咸有保鄕保家之熱誠，我各級行政主官，果能躬親領導，甘苦與共，患難相同，自必人人奮發，子弟願效其力，父老樂輸其財，此在近年勒匪區內，凡能秉此原之賢良長官，均已卓著良效，則足爲借鑑。</p>
<h3>切體人民疾苦排除法外苛擾</h3>
<p>復次，勦匪戡亂本爲救民水火保衛宗邦迫不得已之舉，在勦匪區內，因共匪之摧殘蹂躪，人民生計瀕於絕境，在安全地區，因軍事之供應需要，人民負担，難免加重，胥屬無可諱言。各級行政人員均應切體人民之疾苦，凡法外之苛擾，必須積極排除俾人民能安其生；凡可恢復之生產，與能增進之生產事業，必須隨時推動，俾人民能遂其生，尤其各後方省區，更應發動當地財富，協力經濟建設，取之於地方，以圖利於地方，必爲有識人士之所贊助。</p>
<h3>能否實事求是憑為獎懲準繩</h3>
<p>几此三者，均屬簡而易行，我各級行政官長，果能躬行篤踐，深信地方治安必可確保，半年之內，政治風氣必可轉移，行政效率必可猛進，人民潛力必可發揚，我政治之實效增進一分，即共匪之惡勢削弱一分，則以我優勝之國軍，摧彼將滅之殘燼，肅淸匪禍，決可計日而待。中正昔年勦匪於鄂贛西蜀之間，卽以七分政治三分軍事克奏膚功，管敎養衛，前規具在，以今視昔理無或殊，繼茲以往，中央亦將視各省行政人員能否實事求是，有無顯著政績，憑爲獎懲黜陟之準繩，不稍寬假。希於接電之後，即將奉行具體綱要切實具報爲要。中正手啓。</p>

<h3>美國竸選的新階段　——賀杜魯門總統當選總統候選人</h3>
<p>美國民主黨代表大會於本月十二日在費城開幕，並於十四日投票選舉總統副總統候選人，截至記者執筆時，已獲確息，杜魯門總統及參議員巴克萊已當選爲民主黨的總統副總統候選人了。在投票前的一刹那間，雖因黑人公民權利的問題，引起南方諸州代表的爭執，發生若干波折，但民主黨代表大會第一次投票時，杜魯門總統卽獲得絕大多數，而當選爲民主黨總統候選人，使舉世矚目的今年冬季美國總統競選，已進入一個新階段。</p>
<p>最初民主黨內大半屬意於功勳彪炳的艾森豪威爾將軍，成以爲唯有艾帥出來競選，才能團結黨內意見紛歧的人物。但是艾帥始終反對「軍人參政」，一再堅決表示，不願為民主黨的總統候選人。迨至民主黨全國代表大會開幕的前夕，始有佛羅里達州參議員裴柏接受「拉伕」，出來與杜魯門競爭民主黨的總統候選人。裴柏雖是故總統羅斯福新政派的人物，在他本人雖然也說：「與杜魯門競爭，並不是一種姿態，而是一塲鬥爭，相信必能成功」，但是杜魯門總統在第二次大戰期間，秉承了故總統羅斯福的遺志，執行民主黨的旣定政綱，終於擊敗了納粹德國及日本，其對於美國以至全世界的功動，在美國人民的心底究竟是不可磨滅的．無論如何，杜魯門終比裴柏能孚黨內外的衆望。所以到最後，裴柏也就自動放棄了，成爲一尊的局面；故十四日晚的投票，不過是依樣畫葫蘆投一次票而已。</p>
<p>可是，今日美國競選問題的重心，不在杜魯門總統的當選爲民主黨總統候選人，而在杜魯門總統至十一月間大選時能否壓倒共和黨的總統候選人杜威而獲勝。這一個問題，此時自未便懸揣，而由我們看來，今年十一月間的競選，並不是杜魯門與杜威兩個人的政治鬥爭，乃是民主與共和兩黨的決勝。以杜魯門總統本人而言，在故總統羅斯福逝世之後，由副總統總任總統，那時大戰方酣，勝負尙未能分曉，世界還在驚濤駭浪駭之中，杜魯門總統却能不慌不忙，沉着應變，秉承羅故總統的遺志，忠實執行民主黨的旣定政綱，終於獲得最後勝利，這不能不說是杜魯門總統對於美國以及全世界的貢獻。至於勝利後國際局勢的變化莫測，以致造成目前世界的僵局，也不能說是杜魯門總統一手所造成，何况杜魯門總統所推行的外交政策，也都是經過共和黨同意而決定的雨黨一致的政策。惟世界的危機愈緊急，美國所負的責任愈重大，人類需要美國有一個學決不移的外交政策也就格外迫切；從這個角度去觀察，杜魯門總統的獲勝，也不是完全沒有希望的。民主然之所以仍擁護杜魯門爲其總統候選人，其原因當也在此。</p>
<p>目前民主與共和兩黨的競選，正像演出一餉對臺的大馬戯，雙方的鑼鼓都敲得特別饗。但是世人終覺得，共和黨於六月下旬在費城召開全國代表大會，十分熱鬧非常，人人興奮，四週洋溢着喜氣，充滿了希望；而民主黨大會自十二日開幕以來，空氣比較沉悶，似乎不夠熱烈，不夠緊張，就是在投票的時候，也沒有打破四週沉靜的空氣，好像民主黨執政十六年自己也有些感到疲倦似的。兩相比較，氣象差異，今年十一月的競選，誰勝誰敗，也好像微有朕兆。民主黨全國大會主席麥克格拉斯於十二日致開會辭，一方面以和平繁榮相號召，他說，「民主黨有爲全國領導十六年的經騐，最能避免第三次大戰，並能遷到國內之繁榮，」另一方面又以保守，退步來攻擊共和黨，他說：「共和黨控制」第八十屆國會，將永留紀念，其爲害之烈，遠在戔戔成功之上，其成績實為吾人歷史上最反動，反違化者」；同時梅友起草的「羅斯福，杜魯門」政綱，也强調「民主黨在過去十六年間所有光輝的成就」。在過去，這些動聽的辭令，均足以博得選民的喝彩；但是現在一般美國人聽了，似乎都非常冷淡，並不能引起他們濃厚的興趣。難道外來的危機與內在的騷擾，使一般美國人也想變變政治口味嗎？</p>
<p>誰也不能否認，第二次大戰後的國際局勢及美國國內情形，均未能事事如意。世界危機的迫切，一方面增强了美國對於世界所負的責任，另一方面也深化了美國國內的危機。杜魯門主義與馬歇爾援外計劃，推行迄今，已逾一年有半，但是推行這種政策的結果，對世界言，並不能使兩個世界的裂痕，濟移默化而消除；對美國本身言，也漸漸有經濟恐慌的隱憂，在美國人民渴望和平繁榮的今日，對於政府的內政外交，或難免想到有所變更。此外，還有一點値得注意，這就是民主黨內部的分裂。華萊士的脫離民主黨在美國二十六州內艱織美國第三黨，固然不必置論，就是一般黨員，對於秉政垂十六年的民主黨的內政外交政策，意見也有紛歧，例如民主黨競選的「戰略家」，本欲以該黨特別注重內政計劃及主張廢止種族歧視相召號，但爲南部各州的民主黨份子所反對，南方諸州代表的當塲退席，使民主黨的裂痕格外深刻。</p>
<p>要之，民主黨總統候選人決定後，美國競遷已入新階段，從此可以看出一個眉目，即由杜魯門·巴克萊與杜威·華倫相角逐。而美國總統競選在今日，對於國際政治的影響實在太大，今後的發展，更値得我們的隨時注意。</p>

<h3>蘇致三强覆牒內容公佈　拒絕解除柏林封鎖　現行危局歸咎於西方盟國　但不反對談判謀德國問題整個解決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕莫斯科電台今夜廣播蘇聯答覆美英法三國抗議稱，蘇聯不反對談判四國管理柏林問題，但不能接受任何先決條件。四國談判亦應以德國全部管理問題爲對象，不應專以柏林一處爲限。蘇聯覆文並指責西德發行新幣及美英法比荷及盧森堡六國決定設立西德半自治政府兩事，認爲此種分裂德國政策，實違反四强協定，美英法三國已自行破壞彼等參加柏林四强共管機構之權的法律基礎。至於解除柏林對鎖事，蘇聯覆文不允照辦，如欲爲之，亦祇能視情形自行決定。必要時，蘇聯政府亦當自行設法，維持柏林全部居民獲得充分糧食。總之，蘇聯政府希望引起柏林封鎖之種種困難能及早消滅，蘇聯對於被迫實行封鎖之稱種情形，不負其責，其咎在於美英法三國政府違反四國協定。蘇照會復聲明柏林位於蘇佔區之中心，實爲蘇佔區之一部份。美英法三國照會所調柏林爲國際共管區，而非蘇佔區之一部份，碍難承認。蘇方封鎖柏林實爲經濟自衛起見，以防西德廢止之舊馬克充斥蘇佔區。美英法三國所謂此事違反各項現行協定，蘇聯政府認爲全無根據。</p>
<h3>應付柏林局勢　考慮下一步驟　華府倫敦巴黎保持接觸</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕艾德禮首相今日召集全國閣員，在唐寗街十號舉行會議，硏究蘇聯拒絕三强抗議柏林封鎖後之局勢。約在同時，貝文外相先後延見美大使陶格拉斯及法大使馬西格里，討論同一事件，陶格拉斯於昨夜曾與華盛頓通長途電話。在內閣會議中，由貝文報吿蘇聯答英美法抗議書覆文之內容，蘇聯之拒絕顯然已使局勢更形轉劣。關係方面相信，與蘇談判之途旣已等於被堵，西方盟國祗能加强其空運接濟柏林之制度。</p>

<h3>公用事業費用　中央不允貼補　政院對調整價格指示六原則</h3>

<h3>三輪車上的「小姐」真可憐　父死母入獄謀生出賣勞力　女扮男裝三年始揭穿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三月前北平曾發現一女性三輸車夫，因其身世悽凉，一度轟傳故都，詎世亂年荒，無獨有偶，在本市萬餘三輪車夫中，老閘警局竟因一極微細之竊盜嫌疑案，發覺主角三輪車夫亦係女性所改扮，而其遭逢慘痛，與北國一案相較，正復無分軒輊。</p>
<p>該女李姓，年僅十九歲，其父李長源，本在西門萬生弄二號開設瑞源米店，祇因生母連氏嗜毒極深，老父死後，店務乏人主持，未幾終吿閉歇，家道遂致中落。李女有一堂兄李根源，幼年在電料行習藝，因善經營，已於大新街開設福來電料行，電力牌套鞋廠等，儼然巨賈，但貧富懸殊，自不關切其母女之生活。李女亦有一姊，遺嫁已久，因大家庭關係，更不便對母妹生活有所津貼。李女幼年，曾在馬浪路一心小學受三年敎育，兼以個性倔强，至此乃思依人無計，不右自力謀生，嗣經百方請托，但終鮮成就，而老母烟癖日深，羅掘俱窮，最後乃毅然自動定名「李義」，易釵而弁，於茫茫人海中踏起三輪車。</p>
<p>李女踏車生活開始於卅四年多。初係向南市斜橋筱松林車行租一無照之車，日夜奔馳，聊堪仰供菽水，不料去冬其母突以吸毒罪發，判刑七月，至此李女遂成孤兒，斯時適逢三輪車嚴格査照，車行礙於規定，拒絕出租，李女受此打擊，更兼兩載辛勞，體力已感不濟，遂覺百念俱灰。嗣後流浪月餘，徬徨間得悉神州旅社內寗波妓院生意興隆，三輪車來往接送頻繁，乃萌重操舊業之念，經向神州門前各車夫輾轉自鷹，並泣陳身世，各車夫憐之，遂議決同伴中如有需要休息者，即將座車及號衣輪流借與李女，職業問題因是得以解決。數月後，妓院上下及四馬路附近，均已知悉此事，深寄同情，每有乘坐，輒予厚遺，並爲其題名「羅明」，目前「羅明」之名，神州旅社附近一帶已俱能熟道。</p>
<p>李女體格堅實，胸部束有寬緊帶，頭髮甚短，經常穿着香港衫，短褲，球鞋，故外形絕不類少女，渠自言在入神州前執業兩年，乘客千百，竟無一能辨其雌雄。渠夜間因無固定宿處，或露臥車上，或寄居小菜塲中，長年餐風宿露，面部更見憔悴。渠昨晚斜倚其暫借之五八三〇號黑牌車旁，陳述三年來馳騁經過，並說明前夜因爲該處修車匠李志善勵客「阿龍」，指其盜竊車胎，被帶入老閘警局，惟經訊明無關後，即予釋放，而女扮男裝事亦於焉揭穿。渠末對記者力言不甘墮落，決繼續以勞力換取生活，爲狀實令人感動無已。</p>

<h3>牯嶺女客輕生　丈夫病肺勞怨備嘗　丁貴堂媳跳樓獲救</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十五日電〕海關總稅務司丁貴堂之兒媳，十五日下午五日由滬來牯休養，住胡金芳旅店，其妻瞿女士携兒女及僕各一，同來看護。丁以登山勞頓，致連日吐血，瞿晝夜看護，備極辛勞，對乃夫之病，亦極憂慮，最近川資將罄，數電上海吿急，迄十五日尙未匯到。瞿於下午二時許赴上海銀行詢問時，面色極爲蒼白。歸來後，因吃飯問題，與其夫發生口角，聲達戶外。此廿七歲之少婦怨不欲生，遂爬出窗外，自三樓躍下。丁見瞿攀窗，尙不知其目的何在，且以病重，無跌阻止。瞿墜地時，因係臀部先着地，故外傷不重。當時在地面呻吟宛轉，被路人瞥見，通知旅店老板，羣來扶救。瞿稍甦後，卽對慰問者稱；「我愈早死愈好」，其心中之悲痛，可以想見。本報記者訪其夫時，據謂：僅係小事口角，初不料其遽爾輕生。丁之肺病現延德籍馬大失每日診治中，瞿之傷勢，據主治之陸大夫云：外傷僅左腕錯位，左脚踝扭傷，腰部有血腫，似爲脊椎下端破損，三二日內，尙難謂爲無危險。陸已電請在南昌之骨科專家江西醫專校長孟憲蓋來牯診治。</p>

<h3>浙江興業　繼續餓工　行方與員役談判未能接近</h3>

<h3>上海電話公司　戰後首次股東年會　副總裁報告業務　即可添新綫萬條</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海電話公司昨在江西路該公司事務所內舉行自戰事以來之第一次股東年會，出席股東佔該公司普通股份總數百分之七十餘。會中選出下屆董事歐少甫，費藍理，富蘭克林，富倫，李銘，郞浩詩，雷姆，施德萊，湯麥斯等九人，並由現任首席副總裁之歐少甫上校，報告公司一般情形稱：公司財產在戰時損毀頗重，戰後賴與國際電話電報公司之連屬關係，乃得獲致最主要之零件及材料，以供緊急修理及復興之用。兩年餘來更換之電綫達六百萬呎，修理或更換之電話機在五萬具以上，各電話局之設備亦經全部檢視，一部份機件並經重行裝配及更換，惟大部份機件現尙在岌岌可危之情形中，須俟增添零件及設備能够購得並將一勞永逸之修理工程舉辦完竣後始可無虞。自民國三十四年九月十九日公司收回財產之時起，至卅七年五月三十一日止，其新裝電話三四五〇具，至該日止在服務中之電話總數爲九六〇九八具，尙不能滿足用戶需求。並因通話量之劇增，服務情形大受影響。例如三十四年十月份之平均每日通話量爲四七七八〇〇次，而三十七年六月份則爲七一二二〇〇次，遠過於公司現有設備所能負担，其無可避免之結果，爲表軌聲之遲緩，及一般低於標準之服務情形。在外匯配給未能足夠添置新設備之時，此種情形將繼續存在，唯一之臨時補救辦法，端賴各用戶節省電話之使用。公司於去年曾向國外定得增添一萬條話綫之自動設備及材料，現大部份業已到滬，自本年年底起，經明年全年中將予逐步裝置加入服務。惟公司維持復興及擴展所需外匯始終配給不足，倘欲恢復過去之高度效率，並適應目前及將來之服務需求，則當局對於公司之外匯配給必須大量增加。此外電話費率亦應予以合理調整，俾可付給專營權契約規定對於投資之充份利潤。蓋三十四年公司凈蛞美金五一六八七二元，三十五年凈益二九四四五九元，而三十六年又凈虧三七五八〇八元。在此兩點未達到以前，公司將繼續行使一極端審愼之政策云。</p>
<h3>舉辦平耀務求公允　何謂貧民　甲長職之　民食調配會　特引申說明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民食調配會爲使各甲長，於進行調査貧民工作時，易於確定對象，以免誤解條文，造成各區參差不齊，而引起不公平之現象起見，特就原頒「上海市試辦貧民平糶辦法」第二條，關於該辦法所稱貧民之規定，加以引申說明：几合於下列條件之一而在三十七年六月底以前依法辦妥申報戶籍之手續者，卽爲該辦法所稱之貧民，得領用平糶證。憑購平糶米，但未在六月底以前申報戶籍者，及無戶籍之流動貧民，雖合於下列條件之一，亦不在調査之列，不適用左列兩項辦法：</p>
<p>一·凡同戶人口全無固定或流動職業而又奄無資產（動產與不動產均包括在內）收益者，其全戶人中均爲貧民。</p>
<p>二·同戶人口中，有職華者，不滿三分之一，而其每月收入不能負祖超過人數食米者，其超過人數視同貧民，（同戶人口共有三人，內一人有職榮，或同戶人口共有六人，內二人有職業，負担其全戶人口生計者，卽視爲已滿三分之一之標準，不作貧民論）。例如：眞茹區某甲係某機關之雇員，其七月份收入爲一千四百四十萬元，連本人在內，負担六口（二大四小），每月共需食米八斗，如維持三人最低生活費用日需四十萬元（食米在外），月計一千二百萬元，剩下二百四十萬元，購買七月份三人配售米三斗計需三百萬元，收支兩抵，尙不敷六十萬元，除免費領公敎米三斗外，尙無力購買超過三人每人一斗之配售米，故該戶有三人應視爲貧民。</p>
<h3>地檢處首檢張毓泉表示　決整飭法官風紀　警告投機商人守法務本</h3>

<h3>職工生活費指數發表　半個月加百分之百弱　工人一三八萬倍　職員一零七萬倍</h3>

<p>住屋　二六〇，〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>衣着　二，七三〇，〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>雜品　一，〇八〇，〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>下半月指數　可望趨平穩　上海市生活費指數審議委員會，於昨日上午十時在市政府會議室舉行第十五次會議，由市府統計長張宗孟報吿物價上漲之一斑情形稱：上漲在百分之五十以下者有鮮魚，鹹魚，理髮等；百分之五十一至七十者有苞米，猪肉，牛肉，腐乾，綫襪等；百分之七十一至八十者黃豆，醬油，電燈等；百分之八十一至一百之間者有鹹猪肉，乳腐，火柴，士林布，電車，秈米等；百分之一百零一至一百十之間者，有麵粉，豆油，粗布，綫呢，肥皂等；百分之一百十至一百四十者，有開水，斜紋，百頁，煤球等；百分之一百九十一至二百之間者，有韮菜，菠菜等。價格不動者爲戶口糖。</p>
<p>張氏繼稱：七月份上半月份指數上漲原因，因配米及公用事業，電燈，電車，均於上半月份調整，惟七月份下半月份公用事業不致上漲，配米價格亦無變動，故下半月指數可趨平穩。經各委員縝密審議後，認爲滿意，簽字指數單上，十時半散會。</p>

<h3>割腦療瘋術（一）　青年醫師劉明鐸的新成就</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　邵慎之</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十二日航訊〕半個世紀以來，外科學在醫學的領域中，日益擴張其地位。有許多從前不治的內症，現在只要直接開刀割治便可解決。兩次世界大戰帶來了千奇百怪的外傷病例，對於這大宗題材的提供，醫學者感激而又痛苦，時代的需要强迫着外科學突飛猛晋。</p>
<p>戰爭癲狂症　在大戰中，各國的士兵和人民因砲火和患難而發瘋的數以萬計，這戰爭癲狂症是世界性的人類健康危機。而社會性的人類壓迫也製造了無數狂人，患率的增高，幾乎和產業文明同時並進。使世界醫學者面臨了一個最困難的科目。醫學者便想到以手術刀去探試腦神經，猶如電話工人修理一架總機。</p>
<p>大手術中肺病的開刀，必須有極複雜的設備，使肺部在手術過程中繼續呼吸，和避免由於空氣壓力而致肺臟爆裂。可是對於神經中樞的腦部，這部份雖保持着靜止的狀態，却不是外科醫生所能輕易嘗試的。</p>
<p>靑島陸軍總醫院外科副主任靑年醫師劉明鐸，（今年卅四歲），在王維院長熱烈鼓勵之下，以「腦額葉切斷術」治愈幾個戰爭精神病患者，完成了光榮的手術成果。他把病患者的顱骨鑿開，切斷腦額葉，然後縫好創口，兩個小時後病患者自麻醉中甦醒過來，他的精神完全恢復正常，除開需要休息和愈合創口之外，已經成爲一個正常的人。就是說：他不再發瘋。</p>
<p>兩次大戰中發瘋的人太多了。中國士兵在戰塲上發瘋，有的因神經直接受傷，而使某項器官失却效用，這數目也相當可觀，想來目下不會有統計。靑烏陸軍總醫院有兩個瘋子已經治愈，還有三個正待開刀。營長成志立右臂給予彈穿過，神經破壞，創愈後，全背癱瘓，劉明鐸醫師開刀把神經接好，這支臂膊遂運用自如。士兵安樹文，在戰塲上受傷，腦部受到劇烈刺激，不能說話，創愈後仍然口呆舌結，只能筆談傳意。劉明鐸醫師也擊開了他的顱骨，糾正了神經，他從一二三四說起，現在已正常談話，在醫院休養，到處玩來玩去。士兵文惠生，在戰塲上頭頂部右側受傷，發生外傷性羊癲，合併左側偏癱，同樣鑿開顱骨，用切除手術換救了他，現在也已痊愈，我有到他的時候，他正和同房的病友下象棋。</p>
<p>腦和腦額葉　「我是一個普通外科大夫，硏究外科的時間不過十年，經驗是有限的。對於腦部外科，因爲陸軍醫院腦部受傷的病例很多，引起了硏究的興趣。現時腦部手術，除了腦額葉切斷術二病例外，還有開顱術數例，有意義的三例」。</p>
<p>劉明鐸醫師這樣說。他那天又鑒開了一個傷患者的後腦，鉗出一顆子彈。他運指如飛，手術完畢，混身淌汗，同我走出手術室。十天前本地一家報紙刋了他割愈兩個精神病患者的消息，中央社又給轉播，他說：「我還在硏究呢，說得渦份誇張了」。他是不主張我發表的，「醫學界老前輩多得很呢」。</p>
<p>「精神病在醫學上是最難科目之一，我對這一科沒有深刻的瞭解和認識，對於精神分析等等的檢査，可說很不完全。靑島沒有瘋人院，這些瘋子鬧得天翻地覆，內科部份沒法子處置，才在院務會議上決定用外科手術」。</p>
<p>這天吃過午飯，他把腦額葉和腦部的功能問題，爲我作了一次重要的說明。</p>
<p>適應腦額葉切斷術的理論很多，因爲腦部功能問題，目前還沒有精確決定，精神病的原因沒有一定的解答，所以還須硏究。時下生理學家以爲額葉是精神的最高中樞，是智識的實庫，是心理的中心或器管，有道德觀念感情，智識等等蘊藏在內。可是由腦額葉切除實驗的結果，證明此說不確，腦額葉並不是將所有高級精神上的要件都集中在這裏。智識是吸收外來的東西而形成的，像視覺，聽覺等，是將不同的感覺，存入不同部位的腦皮質內，這種皮質，有極多的神經纖維聯絡，而互相發生關係，綜合成爲更複雜的記憶，時間愈多，這種經驗的交織亦愈複雜。額前葉卽代表這種綜合能力的區域。所以一旦把額前葉兩側切除，此人卽不能再作更精微的經驗綜合，以致社交的動作不能適合，判斷不能正常。可是，如果有一部份的額葉組織留着不除去，那麽他的綜合經臉的能力仍然存在的。</p>

<h3>行局差進銀根仍緊　物價昨賡續下挫　現鈔籌碼缺乏國行正設法調度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市銀根奇緊，行局差進，物似仍繼續下跌。華股因銀根關係，成盤挫之局。米糧因產地售價下落，績降一百萬元，上白米跌至二千八百萬。食糧因前日上外過烈，昨起回風，跌價一成左右。人絲市價亦微挫，紗布行情因受大鈔發行謠言之影響，較昨日略高，捲烟日用品亦略高半成。</p>
<p>昨日發表之生活指數，上漲雖近一倍，但因市而銀根奇緊，物價未受影響，雖商店之零售價格，下午已見提高，惟在此一週內，零售價格固逐日調整，不獨昨日爲然。</p>
<p>此一個月來，因物價飛漲，市民一般購買力已甚薄弱，在市塲上流動之通貨，大部均爲籌碼性質，故據聞此次生活指數之調整，資方亦不持反對態度，認爲唯有如此，方能提高社會上之購買力。</p>
<p>又訊：日來市面現鈔奇缺，各商業銀行爲此正與央行洽商，希望增發現鈔，以應市面需要。商界認爲目前抽緊銀根之局面，不能長此維持，而衡以物價之情形，大鈔遲早必然發行。昨日本市傳聞央行擬仿郵票增値辦法，將小鈔加蓋關金印戳，使成大鈔，以應付現鈔缺乏之恐慌，惟央行發行局對此已加否認。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日爲月中，各業需要現鈔籌碼更見缺乏，據國行方面表示，該行對所缺籌碼，正設法調度中，目前仍分別輕重緩急，盡量供應，缺乏現象即可逐漸消除。外傳該行對現鈔將配給一節，幷無其事。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日本市銀根，走勢仍緊，銀錢業票據交換中。四行兩局一庫共計差進六四四一億，計中央銀行差五〇四三億，中國銀行差進二三八一億，交通銀行差進一四四三億。農民銀行差進出一二〇七億，中信局差進二〇七〇億，郵匯局差出二四七八億，中央合作金庫差出入一一億，商業行莊大交換差出一一八三億，小交換差出一八六六八億，外商銀行共計差進一三四一〇億。</p>
<h3>米價繼續挫跌　麺粉食油市氣均呈秀色</h3>
<p>昨日米市繼續下降，因銀根緊勢未戰，貨主續有吐出。錫市報降，店胃甚懈，去化頗呆，是以價格再削低一百至二百萬元。特高粳爲二千九百五十萬，中白粳二千七百萬，糙秈米廠胃甚呆，開述袋價二千一百萬元，計降二百萬。糯米亦低至二千八百五十萬。</p>
<p>麵粉　早開甚疲，俄因散戶見低納取，中市即見轉挺，終多見軋升。晨市頭寸較緊者，續有吐出，老車粉曾低至八百二十萬，兵船粉曾退入八百萬內，最後老車爲八百六十萬，亦有喊八百七十萬。兵船八百五十萬，紅蜂，建成，等一致挺三四十萬元，麩皮加三十萬。</p>
<p>雜糧　初疲後堅，上落略有參差。黃豆初擯持不開，待汕市開出後始有成交，乍豆最後一千四百萬，挺升一百餘萬，杜豆早開跌百萬，收市轉升。苞米及元麥靑帮去化不暢，續削一百萬，菉豆再疲百萬餘。紅糧吐納均稀，蠶豆亦趨疲途，芝蔴因津帮光顧，故頗堅昂，生仁續削百萬。</p>
<p>食油　市氣轉升，豆油開價與上日彷彿，究因價格較低，散戶見此低價吸納頻多，油廠及回籠貨雖有開出，尙不抵買勢之盛。最後豆油以六千萬收市，小車蔴油重叩七千萬關，吉桶生油最後喊七千九百萬，生菜油五千六百萬，普遍回漲二三百萬。豆餅進戶胃强，餘記餅最活，收市六百八十五萬，挺升五六十萬元。</p>
<h3>本市出口結滙</h3>
<p>七月上旬四百餘萬美元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會推廣處消息：七月一月至十日出口結匯數字，上海一地約爲四百四十七萬美元。其中冰蛋爲七十三萬美元，桐油六十萬美元，鎢砂二十六萬美元，棉布二十三萬美元，棉紗二十一萬美元，鮮蛋十二萬美元，猪鬃十萬美元，草帽九萬美元，茶葉九萬美元，棉織品九萬美元，尙有其他出口品，合計一百九中五萬美元。</p>
<h3>輸管會工作　不易展開原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會人士表示：該會工作之不易開展，全由客觀環境使然，出口之不易提高，乃因國內物價波動過烈，以致出口貨價太高，而影響其在國際市塲上之競爭能力。進口量之不能滿足各方需要，由於外匯頭寸之短少，至於該會之存廢問題，則認爲政府之管制貿易政策如不變更，則該會當不能撤消。又該會決派代表四人，參與美援運用委員會內之決策機構，經常洽商美援物資進口之分配事宜。</p>
<h3>絲綢疲落</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市微降，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤十六億五千萬元，一度升至十七億五千萬元，卒因銀根寄緊而吿降落，午收卽期價低至十六億元賣出價，隔日期喊十七億三千萬元，下午曾升至十八億五千萬元最高價，收盤又降爲十七億元。</p>
<p>廠經　昨市稍疲，各組喊價，均較上日降低三千萬至五千萬元不等，上午高級零擔十七億五千萬元有成交，下午供多於求，市况頗形軟弱，千經喊價，昨亦稍低降。</p>
<p>綢貨　昨市挫降，真絲被面上午開市在九億三千萬元關內，收市降至八億九千萬元，隔日期大起五千萬元之讓，下午最高曾做到九億八千萬元，最後降至八億九千萬元有成交。格子璧縐棧單並無做開，喊似在三百十萬元左右。</p>
<h3>台糖在滬存量　供應可至年底</h3>
<p>據台糖公司負責人談：邇來各界盛傳台糖因產區减產，遝滬之數量遂形减少云云，此純係不法商人故播謠傳，企圖藉此抬高糖價。本公司目前自台灣運來之糖，確較以前减少，但事實上因滬上之存量過多，依目前每期之配售量計算，滬上存量可維持至今年年底。且以各倉庫均無空地，故特减少運滬數量，各糖商申請配糖，亦可盡量申請，公司當無限制配售，以息謠傳，平抑糖價云云。</p>
<h3>茶市升降狹隘</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，專供內銷之龍井綠茶，本街店莊頗有間鼎之勢，惜該項花色，市存枯淍，而產區毛茶，大都爲身骨蒼老之三四批貨色，因此已不適複製龍井，交易不暢。價格方面，巍站雲霄，前途頗有躍躍升起之望。其他花色，晨開在執主復萌扳售中，行情一度盤堅，迨後銀根奇緊，聞暗息竟喊七角左右，拆借尙如登天，過程遂吿回平。臨收結果，一致各守原陣，比前毫無軒輊。</p>
<p>出口箱茶抵押貸款，農民銀行業旋五月開始辦理，六月份數字不大，計六千餘箱，僅三千餘担，本月份數量劇增，各產區新茶，均已紛紛大批運滬，截至目前爲止，已達一萬六千六百二十一箱，計一萬担左右。較六月份幾增兩倍，農行分別按每担八百萬一千萬貸出，已貸出千餘億，內以平綠·遂紅·溫紅爲最多。</p>
<h3>貼放政策轉變　採用收購成品方式</h3>
<p>爲協助生產，貼放會決加緊工作。聞今後貼放政策，已有新轉變，決定採用收購成品後定貨之方式，以達扶助生產，控制物資之目的，並將極力撙節，以防加速通貨之膨脹。</p>
<h3>紗布市氣轉升　中紡昨拋棉乏人問津</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開時以銀根仍緊，本客兩帮納意俱懈，塲上賣氣濃厚，而去化呆頓，市勢因業外物價下瀉，喊價亦挫。四十二支藍鳳紗，開盤喊十三億，十點後聞生活指數激增，廠商以成本攸關，售意遂懈，各方人心亦轉挺俏。本街與客帮納胃重開，市盤步揚，卒以十四億五千萬元結束，明日出爲十五億五千萬元，比上日回漲一億元。廿一支雙馬亦好一億三四千萬，其餘各支組細紗亦均軋升七八千萬至一億左右。全日成單四十一紙，共做粗細各紗一百八十二件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因國行有紗款及稅款大量差進，市上銀根奇緊，塲內交易轉淸，聞染廠方面，因連日標進冷門貨甚多，頭寸亦見緊促，只好將熱門貨拋出，以濟眉急。龍頭細布自三千五百萬曾高至六百五十萬元，卒喊三千四百八十萬結束，回升一百萬元。其他僅嗶嘰步秀外，餘布呈微波湯漾之狀態。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司初有標售龍頭細布之謠，嗣爲彩球細布，布商塡價爲二千八百萬至九百五十二萬元，另有二等品元嗶嘰，四君子漂布元光斜跳繩灰光斜等十稱，被單二種。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡昨仍代紗管會照常售棉，所有請購手續，與原規定者大同小異。昨日請購者，係至原料科領取請購單，且售棉為棧交，種類猶爲陝棉。但掛牌之後，因銀根仍緊，無人問津。結果中紡以昨日原價（二億四千五百萬一担）購進二千担。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡業務處頃公佈，凡該公司所存空日元未提之棉布棧單，限于一星期內提淸，尙未提淸之空戶，第二倉庫兩家第三倉庫計三十八家。</p>
<p>中紡昨售棉布共計三八六〇疋，被單三〇〇條，收回通貨計一〇九，〇六七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。又代紗管會拋紗一八三件，收回通貨計一七六，五〇五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>人心動蕩不定　華股回風劇烈</h3>
<p>華股昨中途仍冒高利，疲後轉俏，惟銀根緊，指數高，人心本易動搖，回風慘烈。開收均現怯疲，流言激賣，未許樂觀。</p>
<p>晨初人心即遭種種銀根不利空氣所威脅，而開低盤，永紗退至八九五〇元，五四號一九九號等大戶及銀行帮斬售，再告下游。中途略有小回頭，終以銀根之壓力，二三六號一八七號等斬售，退至八六四〇元低價，逢低有一五四號一五二號等補進，逐漸回升。聞紗布漲起二成，近午回漲到九一三〇元高價，無如拆借無門，存多臨收急切了結，二一三號八號等賣出，午收退至八九五〇元。景綸跌停後有回，永業聯華漲停，上泥升半成，恒豐信和勤興榮豐中絲商務中法新舉跌半成，統益永公尙平，餘者升降俱微。</p>
<p>後市上塲永紗即躍高至九六〇〇元，六九號八號等進至九八〇〇元高價一六九號八四號等脫手，退爲九六〇〇元，二〇六號九五號等尙進至九七八〇元，不料三時後，在鉅額差進之流言下，反動慘瀉，八九號一九七號等急售，低至九〇〇〇元而後稍定。一七六號一五四號進至九二五〇元，但收市九一四〇元。後市將於週一起停做，賣戶仍殷，收後有供少求，較晨收計恒豐新光榮豐內衣永公景綸華新均平，信誼升一成，美亞低半成，餘者升降俱微。塲外各未上市股票，除大生尙穩外，餘略見低。</p>
<p>公債　昨稍疲軟，成交不過二百萬，統丙晨開自九七萬起，退至九一萬而後稍定，較前收計甲乙丁低三萬元，丙跌五萬元，戊挫四萬。</p>
<p>頃自國行國庫局獲悉：民國三十一年同盟勝利公債第七次本第十二次息，三十三年同盟勝利公債第三次本第八期息，備付基金，業由財政部撥局，屆時可一體開付。</p>

<h3>普及教育新計劃　朱教長報告下學年實施　過去缺點在挪移經費裁撤教局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕敎部朱部長前在立院敎文委會報吿中，曾提及擬自卅八年度起，開始實施普及國民敎育的計劃，並希望在十年以內完成。此項計劃內容及進度，茲探誌於次：査普及敎育之推行，自卅年度開始，曾由部擬具普及國民敎靑五年計劃，就後方十九省市先行辦理。卅五年起更擬具第二次普及國民敎育計劃，全國各省市一律辦理。實施以來，第一因地方敎育經費受統收統支影響，原有經費旣被挪移，敎育附稅亦已銳减，現有小學無法維持，擴充更不可能。第二因縣敎育局裁撤改科，計劃之擬訂與推行，無專人專責主持，地方敎育行政陷於半停頓狀態。</p>
<h3>現時學齡兒童　入校不及半數</h3>
<p>故目前全國在校兒童僅二千四百萬名，尙不及學齡兒童之半數。茲値行憲伊始，普及敎育更應積極辦理之時，本部因此斟酌實際情形，重行擬具普及國民敎育計劃，期於十年以內完成普及工作。自下年度起開始實施。本項計劃之要點：（一）爲計劃與經費須取得密切之配合，（二）健全地方敎育行政機構，（三）學齡兒童應受之義務敎育年限以六年爲原則，（四）師資之訓練與學校之擴充，必須配合，（五）小學一律免收學費，並供給貧苦兒童書籍，（六）每年增收學齡兒童，應依各省市實際情形，分年規定，對於整理地方敎育經費，及普遍恢復敎育局，亦在積極辦理中。</p>
<h3>昆市學潮趨擴大　學生憲警衝突</h3>
<p>强據會澤樓學生未遷出</p>
<p>〔本報昆明十五日電〕昆市學潮自六月十七日反美扶日游行開始，已將匝月，情勢日趨惡化。少數職業學生從中煽動，雲大南菁兩校已形成特區。雖迭經政府當局及校方諄諄吿誠勸導，然毫無效果。自敎部特派劉參事英士來昆後，與省當局數度會商，於十五日淸晨，派徒手憲警分別進入雲大南菁兩校，作最後勸導，當時學生嗚鑼聚集，情勢特趨緊張，雙方終起衝突。盤踞學生以木棍，石灰，石塊，作爲武器，如臨大敵。憲兵二名以傷重殞命。團附張拯東，警局三分局長桀景略，警總稽査組長崔雪影，均負重傷。其餘雙方均有輕傷，已分別就醫。當在南菁校內搜出土造槍卅枝，刻尙有二百餘人，强據會澤樓，不肯遷出，事態似已趨擴大，正由雲大敎職員在樓下與學生通話勸導，並吿以當局決策。何總司令於今午五時招待新聞界，有所報吿</p>

<h3>學府介紹私立大夏大學</h3>
<p>校史　民國十三年六月，廈門大學學生三百餘人因當局者之措施失當，補救無效，不得已全體離校。繼恐中途失學，輕違初志，乃舉代表孫亢曾·倪文亞等十四人來滬，請求前厦大敎授歐元懷·王毓祥等九人組立新校，使獲讀書之所。九月新校組織吿成，定名「大夏大學」，假上海小沙渡路二〇一號爲暫時校舍，九月二十二日正式上課。十一月廿二日董事會推舉馬君武博士爲校長，王伯羣先生爲主席董事。十七年三月遵照大學院頒佈學校條例，改主席董事爲董事長，恢復校長制，添設副校長，公推王伯羣爲董事長兼校長，歡元懷爲副校長。十八年春在梵皇渡中山路傍購置校地百餘畝，同年五月敎部派員至校視察認爲辦理完善，准予正式立案。是年秋，積極籌劃建築新校，前校長馬君武及歐元懷王毓祥冒暑南行，向馬來華僑籌集第一期建築經費，興建第一期校舍，共費三十餘萬元，十九年八月落成，九月遷入。廿年添購大批圖書儀器，讀購校地三百畝，興築療養院，並計劃其他各種建設。迨八一三戰事突起，大夏即與復旦大學合組第一第二兩聯合大學於廬山貴陽二處，後戰局逆轉國軍西遷，牯嶺校所內遷貴陽。距貴陽二十里之花澳購地千餘畝，大夏又定爲永久校址，興建校舍六七座。是時王伯羣校長力疾維持，胃癌突發，於三十三年十二月二十六日病逝。孫董事長哲生乃即召開校董會選出歐元懷·王毓祥爲正副校長。而戰初滬校因大部員生被阻海上無法內遷，二十七年乃在孤烏設立分校。轉借靜安寺路宏毅中學爲臨時校舍，於惡劣環境中弦歌不輟。前後六載，以迄勝利。迨卅四年秋日寇投降，該校安返上海中山路舊址，而佔地四百餘畝之校舍，於抗戰中受創特鉅，麗娃河畔風景全非，昔日崇樓傑構已半付斷瓦殘垣。</p>
<p>現况　該校現設有文理法商及教育五院，上學期學生共二千八百餘人，其中敎育學院爲滬上各校所無，有學生三百餘人。五院院長及各系主任如下：文學院院長杜佐周，中國文學系主任程俊英，外語系陳銘恩，史地社會系蘇希軾。理學院院長邵家麟，數理系主任周昌壽，化學系陳景琪，土木工程系王興。商學院院長何儀朝，會計系主任龔淸浩，銀行系蔡文熙，工商管理系關可貴。法學院院長張雋靑，法律系主任林我朋，政治系葛受元，經濟系韓聞痌。敎育學院院長黃敬思，敎育系主任陶愚川，敎育心理系張耀翔，社會敎育系曾作忠。</p>

<h3>全國體協改組後　各地設體育會　體協分會將予改併</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕中華全國體育協進會，自經本年五月在上海開理事會，決議改名爲「中華民國體育協會」之後，關於經費之籌措，及改組後會務之進行，因該會重要職員常務理事總幹事等，均赴英倫，參加本屆世界運動會，須俟各員回國，始積極展開工作。聞中華全國體育協進會之各地會員，曾就各地設立協會分會，因此有些地方同時有體協分會及體育會兩個單位存立。頃據敎部國民體育委員會關係方面談：此後中華民闕體育協會，祗設總會，而不設分會，因體育事業，是由下而上，非由上策下，例如中華民國體育協會設在南京，而南京祗設一體育會，不設體協分會。南京體育會應辦各項體育活動，則視環境需要隨時自動進行，並非受命於協會，而始推動。依此類推，此後各地旣不設體協分會，其原來在各地已設有協會者，應改組爲體育會，以符法令，而免重複云。</p>

<h3>轉機</h3>
<p>— 碩甫</p>
<p>這幾天內某一日的中午，我坐了廿四路無軌電車從中區到前法租界去。電車至四馬路後，我所來的座位上，已給太陽晒得發燙。倘使要站起來，車中乘客擁擠，更無立身的餘地，但是我的心中，却默默的在期待：只要電車拐一個灣兒，太陽不向我直晒，就可以比較凉快了。</p>
<p>這種希望電車轉灣的心理，正與我們在呆滯局面中，期待轉機的情形相同。雖然滿天陰霾，終有廓淸的一天。而且，人心總是往好的方而着想，「又一村」不一定有「柳暗花明」之美，而我們老是憧憬着「柳暗花明又一村」的境界。</p>
<p>最近大家爲了物價的飛漲，似乎很不安心。這也許是非常時期難免的現象。其實，在變動的時代中，這僅是客觀環境促成的一支揷曲。中外歷史上，不乏先例。譬如在美國獨立革命時期，幣値慘跌，某書上有一節記載道：</p>
<p>「一千七百八十年夏季，通用貨幣，遭人賤視，華盛頓的話說得好，要買載滿一車的貨物，須預她載滿一車的鈔票。先是在一千七百七十八年年終，北部各州內美金票一元祗値一角六分，南郃各州僅値一角二分。至一千七百八十年初，幣値跌至二分，是年終了以前，每况愈下，甚至紙幣十元，祗合一分。</p>
<p>同書又云：</p>
<p>「是年十月間，波士頓市內，榖類批發價爲每斛一百五十元，白塔汕每磅十二元，茶葉每磅九十元，糖每磅十元，牛肉每磅八元，咖啡每磅十二元，麵粉每桶一千五百七十五元。有一個喚做薩繆爾·亞當斯的漢子，購買帽子一頂，衣服一套，花去二千元。未幾，貨幣停止流通，債務無從計算，信用制度，破壞無遺。」</p>
<p>美國當時經濟上的紊亂情形，眞是不堪設想，可是後來美國革命成功，在財長漢彌爾登的調度下，貨幣信用就吿恢復，奠定了日後繁榮的基礎。我想，在政府當局的種種積極措施下，轉機是一定要來的。異日經濟安定後，談起現在的情形，彷彿一塲噩夢了。</p>
<h3>老爺太太</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>亡淸之季，卽出任敎職。那時學校稱「學堂」，敎員稱「敎習」，校工稱「聽差」，聽差稱敎習爲「老爺」。像我這樣一個年不過二十餘歲的小伙子，厠在一輩「標準老爺」之間，亦只好聽人呼我爲「老爺」而漫應之，但心裏總感到萬分不安！民國成立，學校中廢除「老爺」稱呼，改稱「先生」，我心大安，雖然社會間仍有用老爺名稱者，幸我尙未到及格年齡，故與我無涉。</p>
<p>最滑稽的，竟有自稱爲「老爺」的，例如晚歸叩門，僕姵問誰，則答「我是老爺」是。按「老爺」之稱，不知始於何時。據兪曲園小繁露載，謂見元史董搏霄傳「我董老爺也。」査元史，董出此語，係被朱貴兵衆生擒之後，問其爲誰，乃答曰「我董老爺也」云云；結果，衆刺殺之。此自稱老爺之見於正史者。又同書引宋徐夢莘三朝北盟會編云，魚磨山寨軍亂，統領將佐王林，孟根，張衙推等殺其統領官「馬老爺」，此稱人爲老爺之見於逸史者。參互求之，知宋元間已有「老爺」稱呼，且董馬都係軍人，似乎這稱呼都僅限於武職，文職是真亦如比稱呼，階不可考知</p>
<p>「太太」係「老爺」的配偶，此指今人稱呼而言。如亦欲證之於「古」，則似頗不易。歷史上載漢哀帝尊祖母定陶恭王太后傅氏爲帝太太后，後又尊爲皇太太后，「太太」二字連用始此，然此係皇室尊稱。官民之間相尊稱爲「太太」，或係從皇室尊稱改變而來，這稱呼比老爺要「古」得多了。</p>
<h3>「座車」的故事</h3>
<p>— 柳岸</p>
<p>在一百年前，美國有一位名呌般登的發明家，他看看婦女們抱了孩子出門非常吃力，就靈機一動，發明了小孩子坐的「座車」。</p>
<p>但是，他的新發明非但未受歡迎，而且竟被全國男女攻擎得體無完膚！一家婦女雜誌的社論說，「座車把可愛的小孩從母親的懷抱裏搶走，戕害天倫之愛莫此爲甚。」男人們罵得更兇，說座車簡直可以破壞家庭幸福。有一位滔滔雄辯的演說家說：「小孩坐了座車，做母親的便可以常到離家很遠的地方去了！試問她心裏懷着什麽心眼！」</p>
<p>般登被他們罵得無法存身，祗得從紐約逃到了歐洲，這時候才否極泰來，英國的維多利亞女皇和西班牙的伊蘆倍拉后都很喜歡他製作的座車，大家買了結王子公主們坐，從此以後，座車才算正式流行於世。</p>
<h3>談販馬記</h3>
<p>— 雪齋</p>
<p>奇雙會爲弋腔，劇本相傳，出於內庭，泊後皆以王楞仙陳德霖二人所演爲宗尙，其妙殆莫可得而言矣。傳茲二人之藝者，紅豆館主得楞仙之全，而姜妙香亦得其十之七八，蓋妙香初學旦於德霖，享譽爲當時倫儕之冠，繼以嗓厄，改藝小生，而德霖與楞仙常合配生旦戯，楞仙之身段音容，皆耳聆目附而能詳者，故亦以奇雙會之趙寵，傳之於妙香。獨至闖轅門一塲，小生恃之以洒脫火爆求好者，德霖以不與小生同塲故，茫然不知。於時有武生茹萊卿者，爲茹富蘭之祖，正爲妙香說八大鎚雅觀樓之武工，而其人最服膺王楞仙，無論文武諸劇，皆有機必觀，能心領而神會者也，於趙寵闖觼門一塲之身段，竟能得其全貌，遂現身爲妙香說法，故當世之言奇雙會者，舍溥五以外，惟妙香爲得王楞仙之全神者矣。夫閨房調謔，婉轉生情之劇，惟崑曲爲能盡其意致，極其硏媚，然崑弋之界甚嚴，以弋入崑，殊爲格格難合。衡以格調，弋屬花部，亦亂彈之一，而崑屬雅部，正自有雅俗之判，如涇渭之不可相混者也。例以韓君靑白雲生以弋腔老手，學唱崑腔，氣口聲韻，其桀桷扞格之處，顯然不可掩，亦可以爲證矣。然當民國之初，海上搬演崑曲之科班曰新樂府，雖人才輩出，而琵琶長生，玉簪漁家之類，陳構孰套，實不能以歆動滬人之耳目，於是而雙珠記賣汕郞十五貫之類競出，李笠翁諸作亦目爲新聲，而迭爲排演，奇雙會之以弋腔入於崑班，蓋其時也。其唱以七字十字爲準，無曲牌，而有過門，其白俚俗率真，絕無豈曲典雅麗則之致，而獨以淺顯近俗，爲當世所喜，薄職者竟視與崑曲同，不知其爲弋腔矣，此雖習俗所移，亦見下里巴人，和之者衆，匪可以理喩之也。〔編者按：此眞知音人語，快論可浮大白。〕兪振飛以江南世家，爲提倡曲學，作新樂府崑曲科班之敎授，見奇雙會之劇本而喜之，不以弋腔爲鄙，常爲搬演，移崑曲雅馴之聲情容止，以入於弋腔，其美妙殆難方擬，遂馳譽於一時。揆彼紅豆妙香之藝，淵自楞仙，楞仙亦是崑曲出身者，而振飛以後起入梨園，藉奇雙會一劇，竟得大振聲威，使北方小生爲之失色，吁，亦云盛矣！然以崑曲言，凡能演「書館」「見娘」「驚變」之官生戯者，於趙籠之身份，殆皆優爲之，但可爲知者道，雖爲俗人言耳。自振飛之以此劇成名，江南之演此者，皆從之改名販馬記，亦可覘一時之風氣。荀慧生亦嘗新編斯劇，自李奇喪偶起，有繼娶楊三春，及李奇販馬，楊氏毒計逐前妻兒女，彼桂枝保童者，先以孩童飾之，以至二人各自遇救，桂枝招譽趙寵，保壘得中榮任等，雖若情節較明，然冗長之弊，正自難免。蓋奇雙會「哭監」「寫狀」中，將前情供有敘明，其事亦皆耳熟能詳，若復以前情層層搬演，轉令觀者生厭耳。李保意一角，本爲二路小生應工，往時紅豆館主票串，及朱素雲在梅劇團之時，姜妙香皆自願爲配，以紅豆與素雲，在妙香皆爲弟子行，此亦敬老之意也。然當民國三十四年以後，黃桂秋梅蘭芳在上海演此，俱以兪振飛飾趙寵，而强姜妙香爲配保童，妙香輩在振飛之前，論者皆謂其勇於提掖後進，而罔顧身分者，不知其事有繇，綠姜之爲人，有惠必報，因某事嘗得振飛之助也，遂以保童之配報之，孰知此後竟著爲例，伶界及觀衆之見，竟謂販馬記無妙香之保童，大是减色，不足爲全璧，雖曰桑楡之獲，亦可聊慰此老之心，然而妙香年近六十矣，以奇雙會論，其所間接受諸楞仙，而儼然爲魯殿靈光者，竟湮然無人賞識而問津焉，不亦惜哉。</p>
<h3>攝山江總碑殘石拓本</h3>
<p>— 方君遷</p>
<p>一曲臨春殿玉臺，當年側監費詩才，千秋應數江家令，眞見浮華作相來。</p>
<p>六朝煙月總凄迷，無數靑山送馬蹄，收兒解道梁江總，指向樓霞覓辭題。</p>
<h3>換車</h3>
<p>— 徐淦</p>
<p>我現在住着的房子離開那條最早在中國鋪設起來的鐵路不遠。每當火車來去，我不但聽得見，而且看得見；不過看見的不是火車本身，是被火車經過時震動得格格發抖的門窓上的玻璃。</p>
<p>這樣子，一天總要有十幾回，以致偶然碰着這種機會的客人會覺察了出來對我說：「坐在你的房間裏，倒像坐在一節火車上。」</p>
<p>是的，我即使不在目前這樣的一個房間裏，也一直像在火車上，從這一列，換到那一列，從這一節，換到那一節。有些人終生躺在一張牢固穩定的床上，但也還是終了他的一生。那張一動不動的床說來仍然被一個火車龍頭在那里向前拖，慢慢地，靜靜地向前拖。</p>
<p>中途不靠什麼站，沒有下過車，到了；他們是有福氣的。我不是這樣一個有福氣的乘客。</p>
<p>我又要換車了。</p>
<h3>美國點滴</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>歷屆美國總統之中，有三位最受英國人的崇敬，特在倫敦立像紀念。這三位總統是：美國的開國元勳華盛頓；解放里奴的林肯；和團結各民主國家擊潰法西主義的羅斯福。</p>
<p>美國國會屋頂上飄揚的國旗，已經改用「尼龍」製成，據說比布製的旗經久耐用。以前用布質國旗時，每年共需用十二面至十四面。</p>
<p>美國火車車身外部近來大多已塗上一種特製油漆，夜裏能發出亮光，如夜光表一樣，使黑夜中疾駛的汽車駕駛員可以遠遠一望便知，减少意外事件。</p>
<p>美國賓夕爾凡尼亞州立大學最近成立一個骨頭「銀行」，將骨頭儲存在溫度極低的冰窖中，專供外科醫生接骨時應用。</p>
<h3>編劇難</h3>
<p>— 浣人</p>
<p>目前正是面臨着一個多紛擾的時代，單以電影界一方面來說，去年就有「假鳳虛凰」等影片，因內中有涉於理髮師等的劇情，鬧得風雨滿城。因此影劇作家等有鑒於前車，在下筆或攝製時不得不戰戰兢兢地再三思忖，怕一旦觸犯了某一方面而遭到嚴厲的干涉。這類外界干涉的紛擾，不但我國如此，現在，連好萊塢的電影劇作家們也感到這種苦痛了。他們除政府機關，國會非美活動調査會外，且還要被若干道德團體等正式或非正式的檢査，那些寫影劇本的作家們幾乎動帆得咎。在五月份的一期「影劇作家」週刋上就有一幅重金徵求劇本題材的廣吿，這廣吿正顯示了好萊塢影劇作家們因常受外界的干涉而感到的無限苦痛。現在，就將這幅廣吿譯在下面：</p>
<p>「某作家徵求新穎題材，以供寫作電影劇本之用，其內容必須避免政治性，宗敎，離婚，雙人牀，藥物，疾病，貧窮，酒，國會議員，銀行家，香烟，財富，國會，種族，經濟，藝術，死亡，犯罪，生育，肇禍（飛機或汽車）；且劇中反派角色的國籍不能是美國人，歐洲人，南美洲人，非洲人，亞洲人，澳洲人，紐西籣人，愛斯基摩人……甚至連狗也不能。應徵者請函信箱十三號接洽。</p>
<h3>反末世論</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>趙紫宸耶穌傳據近代學者所推算，謂耶穌實生於紀元前七年，釘十字架則在紀元三十年四月七日已初時分。如生年之推算不謬，「人子」在世，不過三十七年。耶穌十九歲喪父，受難時其母至髑髏地親見之；約翰福音不言其母如何悲傷，誠知子莫若母也。趙氏書頗多新意，且文筆靈活，異乎恒見之傳敎文字。其要點在否認耶穌爲末世論者，謂耶穌非末世論之信從者而爲廢除者。其言曰，「復活，審判興世界有末期，當然都是耶穌所信的；但如末世論講上帝的國是未曾臨到而將要猝然之間到的，在臨到的時候，世界要受審判，以色列要復興，上帝的義怒要傾倒在一切有罪的人身上；耶穌所敎訓的則興這些敎訓逈乎不同。趙氏則以爲「耶穌自己就是復活的生命，人的信不信就是一個審判，保惠師聖靈就是審判官。」此論起予，得此然後能復讀新約，彼墨守者何足以知之。</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆</h3>
<p>— 禹壽</p>
<p>暑中恩成都（下）</p>
<p>北平市內少河渠，故什刹海之蹄涔，遂爲北平人所寵異。入夏，結棚賣茶，萬人蟻集，擾攘不可言狀。（北海亦同此例。）成都則溪流交錯，隨處有人支小棚，置矮椅，售風情肫摯之沱茶，足使人消磨一畫。高柳嚎蟬之下，袒胸濃睡，無人來擾，亦不必强求，其趣水也。</p>
<p>少城公園之規模氣度，固不足與北平之中山公園比，而簡鍊瀟濾，興成都之整個格局相稱，吾人徜徉其間，轉覺帖合自然。蜀人有普遍飲茶風氣，茶肆林立，公園中亦以此爲主閣，肆中例售純茶，不售冰水瓜汁之類，故情調不破，吾最喜之。</p>
<p>成都爲保守性較强之城市，無論飲食服用，其所保存之京朝典式尙不少，吾前已說明其理。一般人之所以侈陳其神似北平者此也。惟近年以來，北平日貧，已不能維持舊範，成都則綽然有餘裕焉。東城之稷昇小肆，專售高數夏食，熟櫻作餅，泌橘爲羹，色香味俱臻上乘，蓋其是典藏之京朝品色，而此時北平之北海仿膳，所售餅餌，已粗糲不址下咽矣。</p>

<h3>Principles for the Utilization of US Aid Determined: Balancing Revenue and Expenditure, Conserving Foreign Exchange, and Promoting Production; 70,000 Bales of Cotton En Route to China</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee held its first meeting at 3 PM on the 15th, presided over by concurrent Chairman Weng Wenhao, with Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun in attendance. Committee members Yu Dawei, Wang Yunwu, Wang Shijie, Yan Jiagan, and Secretary-General Shen Xirui, along with the heads of various departments of the US Aid Utilization Committee and more than ten others, engaged in a four-hour discussion. Concrete decisions were made regarding the principles for utilizing US aid and its allocation. There are three principles for utilizing US aid: (1) Stabilizing the economy and balancing revenue and expenditure, (2) Conserving the consumption of foreign exchange reserves, and (3) Promoting the development of domestic agricultural and industrial production. Based on the first principle, US aid materials will be sold as much as possible in the future to contract currency. Based on the second principle, the import of US aid materials will replace regular imports. Based on the third principle, US$60 million will be drawn from US aid to engage in permanent and fundamental construction. Regarding the allocation of US aid, out of the US$400 million, US$125 million is for military assistance.

<p>Draft Temporary Property Tax Regulations (Continued from Yesterday)</p>

<p>Article 9: From the date of promulgation of this regulation, no matter what method the property owner uses to transfer their property, it shall be deemed not to have been transferred. However, if there is conclusive proof of the consideration obtained for the transfer, it shall not be taxed repeatedly.</p>

<h3>President Cables to Encourage Governors and Mayors of Provinces and Cities to Eliminate Old Habits, Go Deep into the Grassroots, Strengthen the Work of Suppressing Bandits and Quelling the Rebellion, and Strive for Effective Political Improvement; Seize the Opportunity of the Victory in Eastern Henan to Redouble Efforts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang Kai-shek recently cabled to the chairmen and mayors of the provincial and municipal governments, encouraging them to strengthen the work of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, seize the opportunity of the victory in eastern Henan to redouble their efforts, strive for effective political improvement, eliminate old habits, and be down-to-earth in their work. The President's original cable is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To suppress bandits and quell the rebellion, we must rely on mobilizing the full strength of the people. All political measures must meet the needs of the people and form a complete force, which is enough to clear out traitors internally, so that scattered bandits have no foothold, and externally, it is enough to resist aggression, so that remnant bandits have no possibility of looting. Then the establishment of a comprehensive war system is complete, and military victory is certain. The consistent style of the Communist bandits is to deceive the masses and incite the youth as their most vicious tricks. If we only talk about force, they are ultimately just a mob, avoiding strength and attacking weakness, choosing gaps to flow and flee, purely seeking food and soldiers, expanding their evil forces, and never daring to engage in decisive battles with the National Army. Until the recent Henan campaign, the Communist bandits attempted to believe that they had been preparing for a long time and had grown strong wings, so they should be able to ask about the Central Plains. Last month, they gathered their stubborn main forces of Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, etc., with a crowd of about 300,000, taking advantage of the weakness of our Kaifeng garrison, and suddenly invaded and occupied it. When we rushed to aid and recovered it, they again gathered in the Sui County, Qi County, and Tongxu area, with long snakelike formations, entrenched in a corner, hoping to fight the National Army to the death and achieve their ambitions. However, after our land and air forces in Henan jointly swept, pincered from east and west, and fired from top to bottom, this huge and fierce bandit army collapsed within a few days, with more than 100,000 annihilated. The bandit chiefs Chen and Liu each led the remnants and fled in panic. After this battle, the Communist bandits' military force is indeed weak. It has been fully proven that they cannot compete with the National Army. It is hoped that the responsible heads of all levels of administration in all provinces and cities will seize this opportunity of military victory, redouble their efforts, and strive for effective political improvement. First of all, we should eliminate the habit of relying on hearsay, be down-to-earth, and go deep into the grassroots. All provincial government chairmen and heads of departments and divisions should personally go to each county in stages for planned inspections. Administrative supervisors and county magistrates, along with county government officials, should go to each village and township every month for targeted work supervision, providing instructions, solving problems, reporting corruption, and clarifying rewards and punishments at any time and place, so that the feelings of the upper and lower levels can be thoroughly connected, the shackles of laws and regulations can be rounded, the pain of the people can be reduced, and the efficiency of politics can be improved. Therefore, the people's attitude towards the government depends on this.</p>
<h3>Training Local Armed Forces Must Be Supervised at Each Level; Do Not Deceive Above and Mix Below, Perfunctorily Telling Stories</h3>
<p>Secondly, the organization and training of provincial security regiments, county self-defense forces, and township baojia is the basic strength for provinces and counties to suppress and defend against bandits. It must be supervised at each level, and organized and arranged in accordance with regulations. Do not repeat the past practice of deceiving above and mixing below, perfunctorily telling stories. In particular, we should encourage local gentlemen, supervise retired military officers, assist the people in organizing and training, do their best to defend their homeland, use the collective force of the local area to suppress small groups of bandits, so as to prevent them from growing stronger; strengthen the organization of people's baojia, and clear out the hidden bandit parties, so as to cut off their internal support. It must be known that the people everywhere hate the Communist bandits' brutality and are enthusiastic about protecting their hometowns. If our administrative officials at all levels can personally lead, share weal and woe, and share difficulties, everyone will surely be inspired, children will be willing to serve, and elders will be happy to contribute their wealth. In recent years, in the areas controlled by bandits, all virtuous officials who have followed this principle have achieved remarkable results, which can be used as a reference.</p>
<h3>Fully Understand the Suffering of the People and Eliminate Extralegal Harassment</h3>
<p>Moreover, suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is a last resort to save the people from fire and water and defend our country. In the bandit suppression areas, due to the destruction and trampling by the Communist bandits, the people's livelihood is on the verge of despair. In safe areas, due to the needs of military supplies, the burden on the people is inevitably increased, which is undeniable. Administrative personnel at all levels should fully understand the suffering of the people, and actively eliminate any extralegal harassment so that the people can live in peace; and promote all recoverable production and production projects that can be increased, so that the people can live their lives. In particular, the rear provinces and regions should launch local wealth and cooperate in economic construction, taking from the local to benefit the local, which will be supported by people of insight.</p>
<h3>Whether We Can Be Pragmatic Will Be the Basis for Rewards and Punishments</h3>
<p>These three points are all simple and easy to implement. If our administrative officials at all levels can personally practice them and carry them out, I firmly believe that local security can be ensured, the political atmosphere can be transformed within half a year, administrative efficiency can be improved significantly, and the people's potential can be developed. The more effective our politics are, the more the evil forces of the Communist bandits will be weakened. Then, with our superior national army, we can destroy the remnants of the dying bandits, and the complete elimination of the bandit scourge can be expected. In the past, when Chiang Kai-shek suppressed bandits in the areas between Hubei, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, he achieved initial success with seven parts politics and three parts military. Management, education, and defense were all in place, and the previous rules are there. Looking at the past from today, there is no difference in principle. From now on, the central government will also regard whether the administrative personnel in each province can be pragmatic and whether they have significant political achievements as the basis for rewards, punishments, and dismissals, without any leniency. It is hoped that after receiving the telegram, you will immediately report the specific outline to be implemented in detail. Chiang Kai-shek, hand-written.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 15th] The battle for the Huai-Xu Highway is fierce. The attacking bandit 12th Column, about 8 regiments, has been attacking the county seat of Suining since the evening of the 13th. On the afternoon of the 14th, they had already occupied Daquanji, a key point on the Huai-Xu Highway (northwest of Suining). In addition, the bandit 2nd Column, about 30,000 people, fled west in two routes from the Yanghe area of Suqian on the 15th. One route crossed towards Suqian, and the other rushed towards Lingcheng, southeast of Suining County. The situation in that area is unclear. The attacking bandits are continuing to attack the county seat. Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, stationed in Xuzhou, has not only telegraphed Commander Sun Liangcheng to hold firm and wait for reinforcements, but has also dispatched elite troops to go south from the Longhai Railway and the Canal Line. The vanguard has crossed Shuanggou and arrived at Dawangji, cooperating with the troops of General Zhang Xuezhong of the 7th Pacification Zone to pincer attack the bandits. Also, the war situation in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is also tight.

<h3>The New Stage of the US Election - Congratulations to President Truman on Being Elected Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>The US Democratic Party National Convention opened in Philadelphia on the 12th of this month and voted for presidential and vice-presidential candidates on the 14th. As of the time of this reporter's writing, it has been confirmed that President Truman and Senator Barkley have been elected as the Democratic Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates. In the moment before the vote, although the issue of black civil rights caused disputes among the representatives of the Southern states, leading to some twists and turns, President Truman won a large majority in the first vote of the Democratic Party National Convention and was elected as the Democratic presidential candidate, bringing the globally-watched US presidential election this winter into a new stage.</p>
<p>Initially, most of the Democratic Party favored the meritorious General Eisenhower, believing that only Eisenhower's candidacy could unite the diverse opinions within the party. However, Eisenhower consistently opposed "military involvement in politics" and repeatedly and firmly stated that he was unwilling to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. It was not until the eve of the Democratic Party National Convention that Florida Senator Pepper accepted the "draft" and came out to compete with Truman for the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Although Pepper was a figure from the New Deal faction of the late President Roosevelt, he himself said, "Competing with Truman is not a gesture, but a struggle, and I believe it will be successful." However, President Truman, during World War II, inherited the legacy of the late President Roosevelt and implemented the Democratic Party's established platform, finally defeating Nazi Germany and Japan. His contributions to the United States and the world are indelible in the hearts of the American people. In any case, Truman was ultimately more trusted by people inside and outside the party than Pepper. Therefore, in the end, Pepper automatically withdrew, creating a situation of a single contender. Thus, the vote on the evening of the 14th was just a formality.</p>
<p>However, the focus of the US election issue today is not President Truman's election as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, but whether President Truman can defeat the Republican Party's presidential candidate Dewey and win in the general election in November. This question is not appropriate to speculate on at this time, but from our perspective, the election in November this year is not a political struggle between Truman and Dewey, but a decisive battle between the Democratic and Republican parties. As far as President Truman himself is concerned, after the death of the late President Roosevelt, he assumed the presidency as vice president. At that time, the war was in full swing, the outcome was not yet clear, and the world was still in turmoil. However, President Truman was able to remain calm and respond decisively, inheriting the legacy of the late President Roosevelt and faithfully implementing the Democratic Party's established platform, finally achieving final victory. It cannot be denied that this was President Truman's contribution to the United States and the world. As for the unpredictable changes in the international situation after the victory, which led to the current stalemate in the world, it cannot be said that it was caused solely by President Truman. Moreover, the foreign policy pursued by President Truman was also decided with the consent of the Republican Party, a policy agreed upon by both parties. However, the more urgent the world's crisis, the greater the responsibility of the United States, and the more urgent the need for the United States to have a firm and unwavering foreign policy. From this perspective, President Truman's victory is not entirely without hope. This is probably why the Democrats still support Truman as their presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Currently, the competition between the Democratic and Republican parties is like performing a big circus on the same stage, with both sides beating their drums especially loudly. However, the world still feels that the Republican Party held its national convention in Philadelphia in late June, which was very lively and exciting, with everyone excited, and the atmosphere was full of joy and hope. Since the Democratic Party's convention opened on the 12th, the atmosphere has been relatively dull, seeming not enthusiastic enough and not tense enough. Even during the voting, it did not break the surrounding quiet atmosphere, as if the Democratic Party, which has been in power for sixteen years, also felt somewhat tired. Comparing the two, the difference in atmosphere seems to be a slight indication of who will win and who will lose in the November election this year. Democratic Party National Convention Chairman McGrath said in his opening address on the 12th, on the one hand, he called for peace and prosperity, saying, "The Democratic Party has sixteen years of experience leading the country, is best able to avoid World War III, and can achieve domestic prosperity." On the other hand, he attacked the Republican Party as conservative and backward, saying, "The 'Republican Party-controlled' 80th Congress will be remembered forever, and its harm is far greater than its meager success, and its achievements are the most reactionary and anti-civilized in our history." At the same time, the "Roosevelt-Truman" platform drafted by Mayou also emphasized "all the glorious achievements of the Democratic Party in the past sixteen years." In the past, these pleasant words were enough to win the applause of voters. However, now when the average American hears them, they seem very indifferent and cannot arouse their strong interest. Could it be that external crises and internal disturbances have made the average American want to change their political tastes?</p>
<p>No one can deny that the international situation and the domestic situation in the United States after World War II have not been satisfactory in all respects. The urgency of the world crisis has on the one hand increased the responsibility of the United States to the world, and on the other hand deepened the domestic crisis in the United States. The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan have been implemented for more than a year and a half, but the result of implementing these policies has not been able to subtly eliminate the rift between the two worlds for the world. For the United States itself, there is also a growing concern about economic panic. In today's America, where people yearn for peace and prosperity, they may inevitably think about changing the government's domestic and foreign policies. In addition, there is one more point worth noting, and that is the division within the Democratic Party. The departure of Wallace from the Democratic Party to form the American Third Party in 26 states in the United States does not need to be discussed. Even ordinary party members have differing opinions on the domestic and foreign policies of the Democratic Party, which has been in power for sixteen years. For example, the Democratic Party's campaign "strategists" originally wanted to appeal to the public by emphasizing the party's special focus on domestic plans and advocating the abolition of racial discrimination, but this was opposed by Democratic Party members in the southern states. The representatives of the Southern states walked out on the spot, making the rift in the Democratic Party even deeper.</p>
<p>In short, after the Democratic Party's presidential candidate was decided, the US election has entered a new stage. From this, we can see a clue, that is, Truman and Barkley will compete with Dewey and Warren. The impact of the US presidential election on international politics is too great today, and its future development is even more worthy of our attention at all times.</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Student Assault Case in Baoding. Zhang Yinwu Apologizes to Speaker Wang.</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Baoding dispatch, 15th] The case of the students of Fourth Cun Middle School assaulting Speaker Wang of the Assembly has reached a preliminary resolution. Zhang Yinwu, the concurrent principal of the school, along with the military and the garrison headquarters, apologized to Speaker Wang on the 14th to prevent further escalation.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Baoding dispatch, 14th] The assault on the Speaker of the Assembly in Baoding is not a student strike. The long-term cause is that Fourth Cun Middle School is located in Nanguan Park. In order to protect the scenic spot, and because the students have built a large number of defensive fortifications, and because Baoding has been besieged by bandits many times, they assisted the army in defending and fighting, resulting in the prohibition of pedestrians from passing through or visiting the park. Some local people were dissatisfied. Last year, Speaker Wang wanted to pass through, but was refused by the school's gatekeeper. Subsequently, the Assembly and the Qingyuan County Government attempted to recover the park site unsuccessfully. The school's cooperative cotton production department was also sealed off, cutting off the source of school funding and student meal expenses. Since March, students have been reducing food and studying hard, accumulating resentment towards Speaker Wang and Liu Liyuan, the magistrate of Qingyuan County. The situation is widely sympathized with by social figures, but they express regret over the students' actions this time.</p>

<h3>Publication of the Contents of the Soviet Response to the Three Powers. Rejection of Lifting the Berlin Blockade. Blaming the Current Crisis on the Western Allies. But Not Opposing Negotiations for a Complete Solution to the German Question.</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Moscow Radio broadcast tonight the Soviet response to the protests from the United States, Britain, and France, stating that the Soviet Union does not oppose negotiations on the four-power administration of Berlin, but cannot accept any preconditions. The four-power negotiations should also focus on the entire issue of German administration, not just Berlin alone. The Soviet response also criticized West Germany's issuance of new currency and the decision by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to establish a semi-autonomous West German government, considering that this policy of dividing Germany violates the four-power agreement, and the United States, Britain, and France have themselves destroyed the legal basis for their participation in the Berlin four-power joint administration. As for lifting the Berlin blockade, the Soviet response refused to comply, stating that if it were to be done, it could only be decided on its own based on the situation. If necessary, the Soviet government would also find its own ways to maintain a sufficient food supply for all residents of Berlin. In short, the Soviet government hopes that the various difficulties caused by the Berlin blockade can be eliminated as soon as possible. The Soviet Union is not responsible for the various situations that forced the implementation of the blockade; the blame lies with the governments of the United States, Britain, and France for violating the four-power agreement. The Soviet note also stated that Berlin is located in the center of the Soviet occupation zone and is actually part of the Soviet occupation zone. The claim in the notes from the United States, Britain, and France that Berlin is an international joint administration area and not part of the Soviet occupation zone is difficult to acknowledge. The Soviet blockade of Berlin is actually for economic self-defense, to prevent the old marks abolished in West Germany from flooding the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet government believes that the claim by the United States, Britain, and France that this violates various existing agreements is completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Dealing with the Berlin Situation. Considering the Next Steps. Washington, London, and Paris Maintain Contact.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Prime Minister Attlee convened the entire Cabinet today for a meeting at 10 Downing Street to study the situation after the Soviet Union rejected the three-power protest against the Berlin blockade. At about the same time, Foreign Secretary Bevin separately received US Ambassador Douglas and French Ambassador Massigli to discuss the same matter. Douglas had a long-distance telephone call with Washington last night. During the Cabinet meeting, Bevin reported on the contents of the Soviet response to the protest notes from Britain, the United States, and France. The Soviet rejection has clearly made the situation worse. Related parties believe that since the path of negotiation with the Soviet Union has been effectively blocked, the Western Allies can only strengthen their airlift system to supply Berlin.</p>
<p>During his meeting with Bevin, Douglas likely urged Britain, based on instructions received from his government overnight, to immediately increase defense in Berlin to demonstrate the firmness of the Western powers' position. It is expected that after exchanging views, the Western powers will soon announce their next steps in dealing with the Berlin situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] Well-informed sources recently stated that the Western Allies may directly ask Stalin to lift the Berlin blockade. They said, "Stalin agreed with us in 1945 on the method of Western troops withdrawing from the area around Berlin, but Molotov broke the agreement, so it is a reasonable move to consult with the Soviet Union's final court of appeal before taking other actions." At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin told the Cabinet that the Soviet Union's blatant rejection of lifting the Berlin blockade is a challenge to the honor and prestige of the Western countries. British, American, and French officials in London, Washington, and Paris are constantly meeting, and it is expected that the three countries will quickly take counter-action against the Soviet Union's completely unsatisfactory response, or send another note to the Soviet Union threatening to submit the matter to the United Nations or the International Court of Justice for arbitration.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office recently denied the rumors that unless the Soviet Union agrees to lift the blockade of the western districts of Berlin, Britain, the United States, and France will sue the Soviet Union in the International Court of Justice. The spokesman pointed out that cases accepted by the International Court of Justice will not be heard until at least two years later.</p>
<h3>Three Commanders Confer on the West German Government Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 15th] The military governors of Britain, the United States, and France in Germany gathered here today to discuss the future of the West German government.

The first item on the agenda was to deal with the counter-proposals from the prime ministers of the West German states regarding the Allied setting up of the West German government.</p>
<h3>Italian Ships as Compensation to France. The Two Countries Sign an Agreement.</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 14th] The agreement on Italian warships to be given to France in accordance with the peace treaty was signed tonight by Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and the French Ambassador to Italy. The agreement stipulates that Italy should hand over two cruisers, four destroyers, and several auxiliary ships to France in Toulon before August 15. France gives up the right to receive one light cruiser as stipulated in the treaty. The agreement points out that the ships handed over by Italy are not war booty, but only compensation for the losses suffered by the French Navy due to Italy's occupation of French ports in 1943. Sforza stated that this agreement is a characteristic of Franco-Italian cooperation.</p>
<h3>French Civil Servants' Strike Spreads to Thirty Provinces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 14th] It was reported last night that the French civil servants' strike has spread to thirty provinces, and the entire country is deeply concerned as a result. It is said that the number of strikers has exceeded 100,000, and if the government cannot reach an agreement with the striking civil servants, one million workers may join the strike on the weekend. The government is willing to pay 3,500 francs to civil servants in major cities before making a final decision, but the unions have expressed dissatisfaction with this.</p>
<h3>Zhang Pengchun Flies to Geneva to Attend the Economic and Social Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th, United Press] Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun boarded a plane today to Geneva to attend the United Nations Economic and Social Council meeting, which will open on the 19th. He told the press that one of the main problems facing the Council is the liaison work of its various special agencies.</p>

<h3>A Veteran of the US Army, Marshal Pershing, Dies</h3>

<h3>Public Utility Fees: Central Government Denies Subsidies; Executive Yuan Issues Six Principles for Price Adjustments</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of public utility price adjustments, the Municipal Council, based on the resolution of the Sixth General Assembly, had previously suggested to the Executive Yuan for reconsideration. It is now known that the Executive Yuan, after compiling opinions from other provincial and municipal councils, submitted them to relevant ministries and commissions for review. Recently, the Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 14985 to the Municipal Government, outlining six principles for handling public utility price adjustments: (1) The adjustment of public utility prices shall continue to be handled in accordance with existing relevant laws and regulations. Opinions from various levels of public opinion institutions may be used by the competent authority as important references. (2) The price calculation formula for public utilities is based on cost accounting as the basis for price adjustments. On the one hand, it aims to maintain and improve the respective public utilities. On the other hand, it also aims to restrict them from raising prices beyond reasonable limits, in order to reduce the burden on consumers. It embodies the intention of comprehensive planning and consideration. Since its implementation, it has enabled the adjustment of various public utility prices to follow a reasonable track. Since April, there has been a relatively large increase. If some of the base numbers and coefficients need to be revised due to changes in the situation, the competent authorities at all levels can submit their opinions to the central government for verification. If there are any excessively high calculations due to miscalculations, the responsible authority or local government should strictly review them separately for public and private operations, and submit them to the central competent authority for approval. (3) When local governments review the prices of various public utilities, they may reduce them based on the circumstances during times of rapid fluctuations in various indices and are temporarily not subject to the 10% restriction stipulated in Article 8 of the Implementation Guidelines for the Public Utility Price Calculation Formula. (4) Central and local competent authorities should instruct various public utility institutions to reduce redundant staff, improve work efficiency, economize on expenditures, and reduce costs. The salaries of all employees of public utilities should be handled in accordance with regulations and should not be paid extra. (5) Local governments in various regions should, together with military and political organs and public opinion institutions, assist local public utilities in preventing electricity and water theft, as well as unauthorized ticketless rides, in order to facilitate operation. (6) Currently, the national treasury is in difficulty, and it is difficult to support either direct or indirect subsidies for public utilities. Moreover, the subsidy expenses are still borne by the people. It is unfair to make the people of the whole country share the expenses for the convenience of a small number of citizens, which seems infeasible.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Faces Most Serious Stage: Income Cannot Cover Expenses, Deficit Exceeds 1 Trillion</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The municipal finance of this city has reached its most serious stage. It is understood that the difference between income and expenditure this month has actually reached more than 1 trillion yuan. The municipal authorities are very worried about this. According to news from the Finance Bureau: The central government ordered that the living subsidy for public school teachers and civil servants in June be temporarily increased by 50% based on the May index (420,000 times), which requires 1 trillion and 400 billion yuan. The central government has not yet decided on the employee living index for this month. It is estimated that the increase rate must be higher than in June. Even if it is calculated with an increase of 50%, the employee living subsidy that the municipal government needs to issue this month will be at least 2 trillion yuan (not including the 400 billion yuan for regular office expenses). As for the municipal treasury revenue, it was 740 billion yuan in June. This month is the season for applying for business tax, which is a low season for tax revenue. It is estimated that the maximum revenue will be around 1 trillion and 200 billion yuan. The difference between income and expenditure is too great, and the financial authorities feel overwhelmed.</p>

<h3>Department Store Salary Increase Plan: Can Be Implemented Starting This Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The labor dispute between the Yong'an, Xianshi, Daxin, Xinxin, and other ten major department stores in this city was not resolved after repeated mediation.

The labor union has the right to participate in the performance evaluation. Initially, the employer expressed dissatisfaction with this ruling and requested the Social Affairs Bureau to change the universal increase of 3 yuan to 2.5 yuan and postpone the implementation of the performance-based salary increase system. A few days ago, Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, again convened both parties to persuade them to abide by the ruling.

<h3>The "Miss" on the Rickshaw is Truly Pitiful: Father Died, Mother Imprisoned, Sells Labor for a Living, Disguised as a Man for Three Years Before Being Exposed</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Three months ago, a female rickshaw puller was discovered in Beiping. Because of her tragic life story, it once caused a sensation in the former capital. Unexpectedly, in this chaotic and barren world, such a thing happened again. Among the tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers in this city, the Laozha Police Bureau discovered that the protagonist rickshaw puller in a very minor theft suspicion case was also a woman disguised as a man, and her tragic experience was no different from the case in the northern country.</p>
<p>The woman's surname is Li, and she is only 19 years old. Her father, Li Changyuan, originally opened the Ruiyuan Rice Store at No. 2 Wansheng Lane in Ximen. However, her biological mother, Lian, was deeply addicted to drugs. After her father's death, no one took charge of the store, and it eventually closed down, leading to the decline of the family. Li has an elder cousin, Li Genyuan, who learned his trade in an electrical appliance store in his youth. Because of his good management, he has opened the Fulai Electrical Appliance Store and the Electric Power Brand Overshoe Factory on Daxin Street, and is now a wealthy merchant. However, the disparity between the rich and the poor means that he does not care about the lives of his mother and daughter. Li also has an elder sister, who has been married for a long time. Due to family reasons, she is even less able to provide financial assistance to her mother and sister. In her youth, Li received three years of education at Yixin Primary School on Malang Road. Coupled with her stubborn personality, she thought that there was no way to rely on others and had to earn a living on her own. After many requests, she achieved little success. As her old mother's drug addiction deepened and she exhausted all her resources, she resolutely changed her name to "Li Yi," abandoned her hairpin, and stepped onto a rickshaw in the vast sea of people.</p>
<p>Li's rickshaw pulling life began more than 34 years ago. Initially, she rented an unlicensed rickshaw from the Xiaosonglin Rickshaw Shop on Xieqiao in Nanshi. She ran day and night, barely making enough to support herself and her mother. Unexpectedly, last winter, her mother was suddenly found guilty of drug abuse and sentenced to seven months in prison. Li became an orphan. At this time, rickshaws were being strictly inspected, and the rickshaw shop, due to regulations, refused to rent to her. Li was hit hard by this. Coupled with two years of hard work, she felt exhausted and despaired. Afterwards, she wandered for more than a month. In her hesitation, she learned that the Ningbo brothel in the Shenzhou Hotel was doing well, and rickshaws were frequently transporting people to and fro. She then had the idea of returning to her old profession. After asking the rickshaw pullers in front of Shenzhou, she wept and recounted her life story. The rickshaw pullers sympathized with her and decided that if any of them needed to rest, they would take turns lending their rickshaw and uniform to Li. Her employment problem was thus solved. After a few months, the people in the brothel and the nearby Fourth Road all knew about this and sympathized with her. Every time they rode in her rickshaw, they would give her generous tips and give her the name "Luo Ming." Currently, the name "Luo Ming" is well-known in the vicinity of Shenzhou Hotel.</p>
<p>Li is physically strong, with a wide elastic band tied around her chest. Her hair is very short. She often wears Hong Kong shirts, shorts, and sneakers, so her appearance is not like that of a young girl. She said that in the two years before entering Shenzhou, she served hundreds of passengers, but no one could tell that she was a woman. At night, she had no fixed accommodation and either slept on her rickshaw or lived in a small vegetable market. She was exposed to the wind and dew all year round, and her face became even more haggard. Last night, she leaned against her temporarily borrowed black-plated rickshaw No. 5830, recounting her three years of service and explaining that the night before, because the repairman Li Zhishan encouraged the customer "A Long" to accuse her of stealing the rickshaw tire, she was taken to the Laozha Police Bureau. However, after questioning and clarifying that she was not involved, she was released, and her disguise as a man was exposed. She finally told reporters that she was unwilling to degenerate and was determined to continue to exchange her labor for a living, which was truly moving.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Various Dyeing and Weaving Unions Went to the General Labor Union Yesterday to Petition: Requesting Salaries Based on the Current Month's Index; Social Affairs Bureau Advises Labor and Management to Negotiate on Their Own</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Workers in the city's machine dyeing and weaving industry have been giving salaries by various factories, mostly half a month after the date of index publication, or even using the previous month's index, affecting workers' livelihoods. The labor union had negotiated with the factories in vain. Furthermore, some of the measures in the wage payment guidelines discussed at the Labor-Management Evaluation Meeting the day before were quite unfavorable, causing panic. Yesterday, more than 30 responsible persons and chairpersons from dyeing and weaving unions such as Dagong, Guangzhong, Yumin, Yizhong, Renfeng, Yuxin, Yida, and Xinguang went to the General Labor Union yesterday afternoon to petition. Ge Xinbo, the general secretary of the union, received them, and then Shui Xiangyun, the chairman of the union, convened a meeting to talk to everyone. The workers proposed two requests: (1) Supplement the June salary according to the 710,000 times index; (2) In the future, salaries should be calculated monthly according to the current month's index. Shui advised the representatives to wait for a legal solution.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management representatives from the dyeing and weaving industry. Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department, attempted to mediate. The employer representatives expressed their agreement in principle to the workers' demands, but because the business conditions of each factory were different, some manufacturers would inevitably encounter difficulties if uniform salary payment methods were established. After Shen's persuasion, labor and management were first asked to find solutions on their own based on the circumstances of each factory.</p>

<h3>Female Tourist in Guling Attempts Suicide: Husband Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Enduring All Kinds of Complaints; Daughter-in-Law of Ding Guitang Jumps Off Building and is Rescued</h3>
<p>[Report from our Guling Office on the 15th] The daughter-in-law of Ding Guitang, the Chief Inspector of the Customs, came to Guling on the 15th from Shanghai to recuperate. She was staying at Hu Jinfang Hotel. Her wife, Ms. Qu, brought her children and a servant to take care of her. Ding's mountain climbing was strenuous, causing him to vomit blood for several days. Qu took care of him day and night, enduring all kinds of hardships. She was also very worried about her husband's illness. Recently, she ran out of funds and sent several telegrams to Shanghai for help, but had not received any money by the 15th. Qu looked very pale when she went to the Shanghai Bank to inquire about it at about 2 p.m. After returning, she had a quarrel with her husband over the meal problem, and the sound reached outside. This 27-year-old young woman was resentful and wanted to die. She climbed out of the window and jumped from the third floor. Ding saw Qu climbing out of the window and did not know what her purpose was, and was unable to stop her due to his serious illness. Qu landed on her buttocks first, so the external injuries were not serious. At that time, she was moaning and groaning on the ground. A passerby saw her and notified the hotel owner, who came to help her. After Qu recovered slightly, she said to those who comforted her: "The sooner I die, the better." One can imagine the grief in her heart. When this reporter visited her husband, he said: It was just a minor quarrel, and he did not expect her to commit suicide so quickly. Ding's lung disease is currently being treated daily by the German doctor Ma Da Shi. According to Dr. Lu, the attending physician, Qu's injuries are only a dislocation of the left wrist, a sprained left ankle, and a hematoma in the waist, which seems to be a fracture of the lower end of the spine. It is still difficult to say that there is no danger within three or two days. Lu has telegraphed Meng Xiankai, a bone specialist in Nanchang and president of Jiangxi Medical College, to come to Guling for diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<h3>Magician's Son Instigated to Steal</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The magician Deng Guoqing lives at No. 14, Lane 58, Xizang South Road. His son, Yugen, is only eleven years old and has a cousin, Chang Chenping, who lives in the same house. At about 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, Chang was bathing in the room. After taking a bath and leaving the room, she found that a 14K women's gold watch placed on her dressing table was missing. She questioned Yugen, who admitted that he had sold it to Lin Yuqiang, a Fujianese (nickname Xiao Guangdong), for 400,000 yuan. Chang reported it to the Laozha Police Sub-Bureau, which sent officers to investigate. At about 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Lin was arrested at the Daxin Company Amusement Park and taken to the bureau, where he confessed without denial. Yugen was also summoned to the bureau for confrontation. Due to jurisdiction issues, the two were sent to the Songshan Sub-Bureau. Chang did not want to pursue the matter because Yugen was a relative and still a minor. However, she accused Lin Yuqiang of instigating theft and planned to transfer him to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Industrial Bank Continues Hunger Strike: Management and Employees' Negotiation Fails to Reach Agreement</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Employees of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank continued their hunger strike yesterday. The employees requested a subsidy of 3.5 shi of rice per person per month. The bank management did not agree to this. At 1 p.m. yesterday, the bank held an emergency board meeting and resolved to provide a temporary subsidy of 15 million to 25 million yuan per person. The employees felt that this was far from their request and said that they could not accept it. Although the bank experienced a hunger strike yesterday, the order was very good and work continued as usual. If it is not resolved today, the hunger strike will continue.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Holds First Shareholders' Meeting Since the War: Vice President Reports on Business; 10,000 New Lines Will Be Added Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Telephone Company held its first shareholders' meeting since the war yesterday at its office on Jiangxi Road. Shareholders representing more than 70% of the company's total ordinary shares attended. The meeting elected the next board of directors: Ou Shaofu, Fei Lanli, Franklin, Furlong, Li Ming, Lang Haoshi, Rem, Schderle, and Thomas. Colonel Ou Shaofu, the current Chief Vice President, reported on the company's general situation, stating: The company's assets were severely damaged during the war. After the war, thanks to its affiliation with International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, it was able to obtain the most essential parts and materials for emergency repairs and reconstruction. Over the past two years, 6 million feet of wire have been replaced, and more than 50,000 telephones have been repaired or replaced. The equipment in each telephone bureau has also been completely inspected, and some parts have been reassembled and replaced. However, most of the equipment is still in a precarious state and will not be safe until more parts and equipment can be purchased and the permanent repair project is completed. From the time the company recovered its assets on September 19, 1945, to May 31, 1948, 3,450 new telephones were installed. As of that date, the total number of telephones in service was 96,098, which could not meet user demand. Furthermore, the sharp increase in call volume has greatly affected the service situation. For example, the average daily call volume in October 1945 was 477,800 calls, while in June 1948 it was 712,200 calls, far exceeding the capacity of the company's existing equipment. The inevitable results are slow dial tones and generally substandard service. This situation will continue until sufficient foreign exchange allocation is available to purchase new equipment. The only temporary remedy is for users to conserve telephone usage. Last year, the company ordered automatic equipment and materials to add 10,000 telephone lines from abroad. Most of them have now arrived in Shanghai and will be gradually installed and put into service from the end of this year throughout next year. However, the foreign exchange allocation required to maintain the company's reconstruction and expansion is still insufficient. If it wants to restore its past high efficiency and meet the current and future service needs, the authorities must greatly increase the company's foreign exchange allocation. In addition, telephone rates should also be reasonably adjusted to provide a full profit on investment as stipulated in the franchise agreement. The company had a net loss of US$516,872 in 1945, a net profit of US$294,459 in 1946, and a net loss of US$375,808 in 1947. Until these two points are reached, the company will continue to exercise an extremely prudent policy.</p>
<h3>Holding a Fair Distribution of Rice; What is a Poor Person? The Duty of the Neighborhood Chief; Special Explanation from the People's Food Allocation Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The People's Food Allocation Committee, to ensure that all neighborhood chiefs can easily determine the target population when conducting surveys of poor people, to avoid misunderstandings of the regulations, resulting in inconsistencies across districts, and causing unfair phenomena, specially provides a detailed explanation of Article 2 of the originally promulgated "Shanghai Municipality Trial Implementation Measures for Rice Distribution to Poor People," regarding the definition of poor people under these measures: Those who meet one of the following conditions and have completed household registration procedures according to law before the end of June of the 37th year are considered poor people under these measures and are eligible to receive a rice distribution certificate to purchase subsidized rice. However, those who did not register their household before the end of June, and mobile poor people without household registration, even if they meet one of the following conditions, are not included in the survey and are not subject to the following two measures:</p>
<p>1.  If all members of a household have no fixed or mobile occupation and have no assets (including movable and immovable property) or income, all members of the household are considered poor people.</p>
<p>2.  If less than one-third of the household members have an occupation, and their monthly income cannot afford enough rice for all household members, the number of people exceeding the rice affordability threshold will be considered poor people. (If a household has three members, and only one has an occupation, or a household has six members, and only two have an occupation, and they are responsible for the livelihood of the entire household, it will be considered that the one-third standard is met and will not be considered poor people). For example: Mr. Jia from the Zhenru District is an employee of a certain organization. His income for July is 14.4 million yuan. Including himself, he is responsible for six people (two adults and four children). The monthly rice consumption is eight dou. If maintaining the minimum living expenses for three people requires 400,000 yuan per day (excluding rice), the monthly cost is 12 million yuan. The remaining 2.4 million yuan is used to purchase three dou of subsidized rice for July, which costs 3 million yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there is still a shortfall of 600,000 yuan. In addition to receiving three dou of public education rice for free, he is unable to purchase the subsidized rice allocation of one dou per person for the remaining three people. Therefore, three members of the household should be considered poor people.</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor Zhang Yuquan of the District Prosecutor's Office States Decision to Rectify the Morality of Judges; Warns Speculative Merchants to Abide by the Law and Focus on Business</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Zhang Yuquan, met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday, emphasizing the importance of the morality of judicial officials today, which he will vigorously rectify. He said: Only when judicial officials themselves have a spirit of abiding by the law can they represent the country in enforcing the law. Therefore, at the beginning of his tenure, he prioritized the morality of judicial officials. Zhang also warned speculative merchants to abide by the law and focus on business. He stated: The current soaring prices in the city are actually due to the speculative merchants' failure to comply with the law. In the past, Chinese people considered not abiding by the law as "honor." This morbid psychology must be eliminated. Today, only when everyone has a spirit of abiding by the law can the country move towards stability. Chief Prosecutor Zhang is currently working on reorganizing the work of the Prosecutor's Office. In the future, prosecutors will strive to be swift in handling cases. Every case must be resolved within one week. The detention of criminals will also be carefully determined according to their crimes to avoid wrongful imprisonment. Finally, Zhang told the reporter: There are a large number of criminal cases in the city. The office receives an average of more than 100 cases per day, totaling more than 3,000 cases per month, which is one-third more than the entire province of Jiangxi.</p>

<p>Housing: 260,000 times</p>
<p>Clothing: 2,730,000 times</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: 1,080,000 times</p>
<p>Index for the Second Half of the Month Expected to Stabilize The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Review Committee held its 15th meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Zongmeng, the head of the Municipal Government Statistics Office, reported on the situation of rising prices: the increase was less than 50% for fresh fish, salted fish, haircuts, etc.; the increase was between 51% and 70% for corn, pork, beef, dried tofu, socks, etc.; the increase was between 71% and 80% for soybeans, soy sauce, electricity, etc.; the increase was between 81% and 100% for salted pork, fermented bean curd, matches, Shilin cloth, trams, Xian rice, etc.; the increase was between 101% and 110% for flour, soybean oil, coarse cloth, flannel, soap, etc.; the increase was between 110% and 140% for boiled water, twill, Baiye tofu, coal briquettes, etc.; the increase was between 191% and 200% for chives, spinach, etc. The price of household sugar remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Zhang continued: The reason for the increase in the index in the first half of July was that the allocated rice and public utilities (electricity, trams) were all adjusted in the first half of the month. However, public utilities will not increase in the second half of July, and the price of allocated rice will also remain unchanged, so the index for the second half of the month is expected to stabilize. After careful deliberation by the committee members, they were satisfied and signed the index sheet. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>

<h3>Lobotomy (1) New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Telegram from Qingdao, 12th] For half a century, surgery has increasingly expanded its position in the field of medicine. Many previously incurable internal diseases can now be resolved by direct surgery. The two world wars brought a myriad of strange and unusual traumatic cases. Medical scholars are grateful and pained for the provision of this large amount of material. The needs of the times are forcing surgery to develop by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>War Madness During the war, the soldiers and people of various countries went mad in the tens of thousands due to artillery fire and hardship. This war madness is a global human health crisis. Social human oppression has also created countless madmen. The increase in the rate of illness is almost progressing simultaneously with industrial civilization, putting medical scholars around the world on the threshold of one of the most difficult subjects. Medical scholars then thought of using a scalpel to probe the brain nerves, just as telephone workers repair a switchboard.</p>
<p>Surgery for lung disease in a major operation must have extremely complex equipment to allow the lungs to continue breathing during the operation and avoid the lungs from bursting due to air pressure. However, for the brain, the central nervous system, although this part remains in a static state, it is not something that surgeons can easily try.</p>
<p>Liu Mingduo, a young doctor (34 years old this year), deputy director of surgery at the Qingdao General Army Hospital, with the enthusiastic encouragement of President Wang Wei, cured several war mental patients with "frontal lobotomy," completing a glorious surgical achievement. He chiseled open the skull of the patient, cut off the frontal lobe of the brain, and then sewed up the wound. Two hours later, the patient woke up from anesthesia, and his spirit was completely restored to normal. Except for the need to rest and heal the wound, he had become a normal person. That is to say, he is no longer crazy.</p>
<p>Too many people went mad in the two world wars. Chinese soldiers went mad on the battlefield, some because their nerves were directly injured, causing certain organs to lose their effectiveness. The number is also considerable. It is speculated that there will be no statistics on it at the moment. The Qingdao General Army Hospital has cured two madmen, and three more are waiting for surgery. Battalion Commander Cheng Zhili's right arm was pierced by a bullet, and the nerves were damaged. After the wound healed, the entire back was paralyzed. Dr. Liu Mingduo operated to connect the nerves, and the arm was able to move freely. Soldier An Shuwen was injured on the battlefield and suffered severe stimulation to the brain. He was unable to speak. After the wound healed, he remained mute and could only communicate in writing. Dr. Liu Mingduo also chiseled open his skull and corrected the nerves. He started from one, two, three, four, and now he can talk normally, resting in the hospital, playing around everywhere. Soldier Wen Huisheng was injured on the upper right side of his head on the battlefield, developing traumatic epilepsy combined with left hemiplegia. He was similarly rescued by chiseling open the skull and using resection surgery. He has now recovered. When I visited him, he was playing chess with his roommate.</p>
<p>Brain and Frontal Lobe "I am an ordinary surgeon. I have only been studying surgery for ten years, and my experience is limited. For brain surgery, because the Army Hospital has many cases of brain injuries, it has aroused my interest in research. At present, in addition to frontal lobotomy for two diseases, there are also several cases of craniotomy, three of which are significant."</p>
<p>Dr. Liu Mingduo said this. That day, he opened the back of another injured patient's head and removed a bullet with pliers. He moved his fingers like flying, and after the surgery was completed, he walked out of the operating room with me, dripping with sweat. Ten days ago, a local newspaper published the news that he had cured two mental patients, and the Central News Agency rebroadcasted it. He said, "I am still researching. It is a bit exaggerated." He does not agree with me publishing it. "There are many senior veterans in the medical field."</p>
<p>"Mental illness is one of the most difficult subjects in medicine. I don't have a deep understanding and knowledge of this subject, and the examinations for mental analysis, etc., can be said to be very incomplete. There is no mental hospital in Qingdao. These madmen are causing chaos. The internal medicine department has no way to deal with it, so it was decided to use surgery at the hospital affairs meeting."</p>
<p>After lunch that day, he gave me an important explanation of the function of the frontal lobe and the brain.</p>
<p>There are many theories suitable for frontal lobotomy. Because the problem of brain function has not yet been accurately determined and the cause of mental illness has no definite answer, further research is needed. Physiologists now believe that the frontal lobe is the highest center of the spirit, the treasure trove of knowledge, the center or organ of psychology, with moral concepts, emotions, knowledge, etc. stored within. However, the results of the frontal lobe resection experiment prove that this statement is not accurate. The frontal lobe does not concentrate all the essential elements of higher spirit here. Knowledge is formed by absorbing external things, such as vision and hearing. It stores different sensations in different parts of the cerebral cortex. This cortex has a large number of nerve fibers connected, which interact with each other and synthesize into more complex memories. The more time passes, the more complex the interwoven experience becomes. The frontal lobe represents the area of this comprehensive ability. Therefore, once both sides of the frontal lobe are cut off, the person can no longer make more subtle comprehensive experiences, so that social actions are not suitable and judgments cannot be normal. However, if a part of the frontal lobe tissue is left and not removed, then his ability to synthesize experiences still exists.</p>

<h3>Pseudo-Songjiang County Magistrate Yang Shijie Re-enters Prison; Arrived in Suzhou Yesterday to Surrender, Saying He Was Fooled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Telegram from Suzhou, 15th] Yang Shijie, the imprisoned traitor and pseudo-Songjiang County Magistrate, who was collusively released by the court bailiffs and police of the Suzhou High Court, suddenly came to Suzhou from Shanghai this afternoon to surrender. Zhang Chen, the prosecutor, and Yao, the presiding judge of the criminal court, successively opened court to interrogate him. It is reported that Yang confessed: On the 5th of this month, court bailiff Zhou Jiucheng came to the prison to chat and encouraged him to apply for bail. He then instructed his family to contact Zhou. On the 8th, he prepared a bail application, and on the 9th, he was released, believing that it was legally approved by the court. Therefore, he took a bath, shaved his head, burned incense to thank the gods, and stayed overnight at the Queen Hotel. The next day, he went to the First Prison to visit fellow prisoners, such as the pseudo-Taixian County Magistrate Zhu Han, and said goodbye. He also went to the sub-prison to collect his belongings, took a car to Shanghai, and entered the Yongchuan Hospital in Eight Immortals Bridge for treatment. He then read the Shen Bao for several days and realized that he had been fooled, which had harmed his guarantor. He rushed back to surrender today to clarify the truth, etc. After the interrogation, he was taken into custody. The High Court's court and prosecutor's office have held several court sessions in secret. Even the court bailiffs were barred from the criminal court's session, so the truth of the matter is still awaiting public announcement by the court.</p>
<h3>Capture of Bandit Leader in Chongming</h3>

<h3>Banks and Financial Institutions Still Tight on Funds, Commodity Prices Continued to Decline Yesterday, Lack of Cash Chips, National Banks Are Trying to Allocate</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the city's money market was extremely tight, banks and financial institutions were short of funds, and commodity prices continued to fall. Due to monetary reasons, Chinese stocks saw a sharp decline in trading. Rice and grain prices fell by one million yuan due to price drops in production areas, with top-grade white rice falling to twenty-eight million. Food prices, which had risen too sharply the day before, corrected yesterday, falling by about 10%. The market price of artificial silk also declined slightly. The price of cotton cloth was slightly higher than yesterday due to rumors of the issuance of large banknotes. Cigarettes and daily necessities were also slightly higher by 0.5%.</p>
<p>Although the cost-of-living index released yesterday had increased by nearly onefold, commodity prices were not affected due to the tight money market. Although retail prices in stores had already increased in the afternoon, retail prices are adjusted daily within this week, not only yesterday.</p>
<p>In the past month, due to soaring commodity prices, the general purchasing power of citizens has been very weak. Most of the currency circulating in the market is in the nature of bargaining chips. Therefore, it is said that capital is not opposed to the adjustment of the cost-of-living index this time, believing that this is the only way to improve the purchasing power of society.</p>
<p>Another report: Recently, there has been a severe shortage of cash in the market. To this end, various commercial banks are negotiating with the Central Bank, hoping to increase the issuance of cash to meet market needs. The business community believes that the current situation of tightening money cannot be maintained for a long time, and judging from the situation of commodity prices, large banknotes will inevitably be issued sooner or later. Yesterday, rumors spread in the city that the Central Bank intends to imitate the stamp value-added method, stamping small banknotes with customs gold seals to turn them into large banknotes to cope with the panic of cash shortage. However, the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has denied this.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday was the middle of the month, and the demand for cash bargaining chips in various industries was even more lacking. According to the National Bank, the bank is trying to allocate the missing chips and is currently supplying them as much as possible, prioritizing urgency. The shortage phenomenon can be gradually eliminated. It is rumored that the bank will allocate cash, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the city's money market trend remained tight. In the clearing of bills by the silver and money industry, the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury had a total shortfall of 644.1 billion, including a shortfall of 504.3 billion for the Central Bank, 238.1 billion for the Bank of China, and 144.3 billion for the Bank of Communications. The Farmers Bank had a shortfall of 120.7 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a shortfall of 207 billion, the Postal Remittance Bureau had a shortfall of 247.8 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a shortfall of 11 billion, the commercial banks and private banks had a large shortfall of 118.3 billion, a small shortfall of 186.68 billion, and foreign banks had a total shortfall of 134.1 billion.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Flour and Edible Oil Markets Are Also Promising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market continued to decline. Because the tight money situation did not abate, goods owners continued to sell off. The Tin market reported a decline, shop interest was very relaxed, and sales were sluggish, so prices were reduced by another 100 to 200 million yuan. Special high-grade japonica rice was 29.5 million, medium white japonica rice was 27 million, and the rice mill interest in coarse indica rice was very sluggish, opening a bag price of 21 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million. Glutinous rice also fell to 28.5 million.</p>
<p>Flour: The early opening was very weak. Because individual investors saw low prices and took them in, the central market immediately turned strong, and eventually saw more squeezes. Those with tighter positions in the morning market continued to sell off. Old car flour once fell to 8.2 million, and Bingchuan flour once retreated into 8 million. Finally, old car flour was 8.6 million, and some shouted 8.7 million. Bingchuan was 8.5 million, and Hongfeng, Jiancheng, etc. all rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, and wheat bran increased by 300,000.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains: The early market was weak and then firm, with slight differences in ups and downs. Yellow soybeans were initially rejected and could not be opened. Transactions began after the Shantou market opened. Zha soybeans finally reached 14 million, a rise of more than 1 million. Duzhou soybeans fell by millions in early trading, but turned up at the close. Corn and Yuanmai Qingbang went out of stock slowly and continued to cut 1 million yuan. Green beans were tired again by more than 1 million. Red sorghum was rarely traded, broad beans also tended to be tired, and sesame was quite firm and expensive due to the patronage of the Tianjin gang, and raw kernels continued to cut millions.</p>
<p>Edible oil: The market sentiment turned up. The opening price of soybean oil was similar to the previous day. After all, the price was low, and individual investors saw this low price and absorbed frequently. Although oil mills and return goods had opened, they were still not as good as the strong buying momentum. Finally, soybean oil closed at 60 million yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil hit the 70 million mark again. Jiton Sheng oil finally shouted 79 million, and raw vegetable oil 56 million, generally rising by 2 million to 3 million. Soybean cake into the household stomach is strong, Yu Ji cake is the most active, closing at 6.85 million, up 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>This City's Export Settlement</h3>
<p>More Than 4 Million US Dollars in Early July</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the promotion office of the Export Control Commission: the export settlement figures from July 1st to 10th in Shanghai were approximately 4.47 million US dollars.

<h3>Reasons for the Difficult Development of the Export Control Commission's Work</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to people from the Export Control Commission: The difficulty in developing the work of the Commission is entirely due to the objective environment. The difficulty in increasing exports is due to excessive fluctuations in domestic commodity prices, which have resulted in too high export prices, affecting their competitiveness in the international market. The inability of imports to meet the needs of all parties is due to the shortage of foreign exchange positions. As for the issue of the survival of the Commission, it is believed that if the government's trade control policy is not changed, the Commission cannot be abolished. In addition, the Commission decided to send four representatives to participate in the decision-making body within the US Aid Utilization Committee to regularly discuss the distribution of US Aid materials imports.</p>
<h3>Silk Falling</h3>
<p>Artificial silk fell slightly in yesterday's market. Jin San Ma with light No. 120 opened at 1.65 billion yuan in the morning, once rising to 1.75 billion yuan, but fell due to tight money. The immediate price at noon closed as low as 1.6 billion yuan, and the next day was called 1.73 billion yuan. In the afternoon, it once rose to the highest price of 1.85 billion yuan, and the closing price fell to 1.7 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Sugar's Inventory in Shanghai Can Be Supplied Until the End of the Year</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company: Recently, all walks of life have been rumored that Taiwan Sugar's production has been reduced in the production area, and the quantity in Shanghai has been reduced. This is purely a rumor deliberately spread by illegal merchants in an attempt to raise sugar prices. The amount of sugar transported from Taiwan by our company is indeed less than before, but in fact, because there is too much inventory in Shanghai, calculated according to the current allocation volume per period, the inventory in Shanghai can be maintained until the end of this year. Moreover, because there is no empty space in each warehouse, the number of shipments to Shanghai has been reduced. Sugar merchants can apply for sugar distribution as much as possible, and the company will not restrict sales to dispel rumors and stabilize sugar prices.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Rises and Falls Narrowly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market, Longjing green tea, which is exclusively for domestic sales, had a tendency to compete in the street shops, but unfortunately, this type of variety has dried up in the market, and most of the raw tea in the production area is the old third and fourth batches of goods, so it is not suitable for reproducing Longjing, and the transaction is not smooth. In terms of price, Wei Zhan Yunxiao has a promising prospect of rising. For other varieties, the morning opening was in the revival of the principal, and the market once became firm, but later the money market was extremely tight, and it was heard that the dark interest was as high as 70%, and borrowing was still as difficult as climbing to the sky, and the process returned to equilibrium. As a result, they all stuck to their original positions and did not change at all compared to before.</p>
<p>Export container tea mortgage loans were handled by the Farmers Bank in May, and the number in June was not large, totaling more than 6,000 boxes, only more than 3,000 dan. The quantity this month has increased dramatically, and new tea from various producing areas has been transported to Shanghai in large quantities. As of now, it has reached 16,621 boxes, totaling about 10,000 dan, which is almost double that of June. The Agricultural Bank has lent out 8 million to 10 million per dan, and has lent out more than 100 billion, mainly Pinglv, Suihong, and Wenhong.</p>
<h3>Change in Discount Policy, Adopting the Method of Purchasing Finished Products</h3>
<p>In order to assist production, the Discount Committee decided to step up its work. It is heard that there has been a new change in the discount policy in the future. It has been decided to adopt the method of purchasing finished products and then ordering goods to achieve the purpose of supporting production and controlling materials, and will make every effort to economize to prevent accelerating currency inflation.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Market Turns Up, China Textile Yesterday Threw Cotton But No One Asked</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market, at the beginning of the market, due to the tight money situation, both local and foreign merchants were slack in paying, the selling atmosphere on the market was strong, but the sales were sluggish, and the market situation was also frustrated due to the decline in off-market prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at 1.3 billion, and after 10 o'clock, it was heard that the cost of living index had soared, and manufacturers were slack in selling because of cost concerns, and all parties' hearts turned firm. This street and the guest gang reopened their stomachs, and the market rose step by step, and finally ended at 1.45 billion yuan, and tomorrow it will be 1.55 billion yuan, a rise of 100 million yuan from the previous day. 21-count Shuangma also had 130 million to 40 million, and the remaining count fine yarns also rose by 70 million to 80 million to about 100 million. There were 41 orders for the whole day, a total of 182 pieces of coarse and fine yarns.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, because the National Bank had a large amount of yarn money and tax money, the money market was extremely tight, and the transactions in the market turned clear. It was heard that the dyeing factories had bid for a lot of unpopular goods in recent days, and their positions were also tight, so they had to throw out popular goods to relieve their urgent needs. Longtou fine cloth once rose from 35 million to 6.5 million yuan, and finally shouted 34.8 million to end, a rise of 1 million yuan. In addition to Bi Ji Bu Xiu, the remaining cloth showed a state of slight waves.</p>
<p>Another report: At first, there was a rumor that Fangjian Company would sell Longtou fine cloth by bidding, and then it was Caiqiu fine cloth. The cloth merchants filled in the price of 28 million to 9.52 million yuan. There were also second-class Yuan Bi Ji, Sijunzi Piaobu Yuan Guang Xie Tiaosheng Hui Guang Xie, etc. Ten types, two types of bed sheets.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, China Textile still sold cotton as usual on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee. All purchase procedures were similar to the original regulations. Yesterday's purchasers went to the raw material department to collect the purchase orders, and the cotton sold was handed over to the stack, and the variety was still Shaanxi cotton. However, after the listing, because the money market was still tight, no one asked. As a result, China Textile purchased 2,000 dans at yesterday's original price (245 million yuan per dan).</p>
<p>Another report: The Business Office of China Textile recently announced that all empty yen cotton cloth stack orders stored by the company must be cleared within one week. There are two empty households in the second warehouse and 38 in the third warehouse that have not been cleared.</p>
<p>China Textile sold a total of 3,860 pieces of cotton cloth and 300 bed sheets yesterday, recovering a total of 109,067,000,000 yuan. In addition, it sold 183 pieces of yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee, recovering a total of 176,505,000,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>People's Hearts Are Unstable, and Chinese Stocks Rebounded Sharply</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks still risked high profits in the middle of yesterday, turned up after being tired, but the money was tight, the index was high, and people's hearts were easy to be shaken, and the rebound was tragic. The opening and closing both showed timidity, and the rumors stimulated sales, which was not optimistic.</p>
<p>In the early morning, people's hearts were threatened by various unfavorable money market air, and the market opened low. Yongsha retreated to 8,950 yuan, and major households and bank gangs such as No. 54 and No. 199 cut and sold, and then downstream. There was a slight callback in the middle, and finally, under the pressure of tight money, No. 236 and No. 187 cut and sold, retreating to a low price of 8,640 yuan. There were No. 154 and No. 152 who supplemented the entry at the low, and gradually rebounded. It was heard that yarn and cloth rose by 20%, and the midday rebound rose to a high price of 9,130 yuan. If there was no way to borrow, many people were eager to close the settlement before the close, and No. 213 and No. 8 sold out, and the midday close retreated to 8,950 yuan. Jinglun fell to the limit and then recovered. Yongye Lianhua rose to the limit. Shangni rose by half a percent. Hengfeng Xinyi Qinxing Rongfeng Zhongsichangwu Zhongfaxin fell by half a percent.

No. 206 and No. 95 still entered a high price of 9,780 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 3 o'clock, under the rumors of huge shortfalls, the reaction tragically poured, and No. 89 and No. 197 sold urgently, falling to 9,000 yuan before settling slightly. No. 176 and No. 154 entered 9,250 yuan, but the closing price was 9,140 yuan. The after-market will be suspended from Monday.

<h3>New Plan for Popularizing Education, Minister Zhu Reports Implementation in the Next School Year, Past Shortcomings Were in Transferring Funds and Abolishing Education Bureaus</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing on the 15th] Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education mentioned in his report to the Education and Culture Committee of the Legislative Yuan that he plans to start implementing a plan to popularize national education starting from the 38th year and hopes to complete it within ten years. The content and progress of this plan are recorded as follows: The promotion of popular education began in the 30th year. The Ministry formulated a five-year plan for popularizing national youth education and handled it first in the 19 provinces and cities in the rear. Starting from the 35th year, a second plan for popularizing national education was formulated, and all provinces and cities across the country were handled uniformly. Since its implementation, firstly, the local education funds have been affected by the unified revenue and expenditure. The original funds have been transferred, and the education surtax has also been sharply reduced. The existing primary schools cannot be maintained, and expansion is even more impossible. Secondly, the county education bureaus have been abolished and changed to departments. There are no dedicated personnel in charge of the planning and implementation, and local education administration has fallen into a state of semi-paralysis.</p>
<h3>Less Than Half of the Current School-Age Children Are Enrolled in Schools</h3>
<p>Therefore, there are currently only 24 million children in school nationwide, which is less than half of the school-age children. As the constitution is about to be implemented, the popularization of education should be handled more actively. Therefore, the Ministry is considering the actual situation and re-formulating a plan to popularize national education, with the goal of completing the popularization work within ten years. It will be implemented starting from the next year. The main points of this plan are: (1) The plan and funds must be closely coordinated, (2) Sound local education administrative institutions, (3) The compulsory education period for school-age children should be six years in principle, (4) The training of teachers and the expansion of schools must be coordinated, (5) Primary schools shall not charge tuition fees, and books shall be provided to poor children, (6) The annual increase in school-age children shall be stipulated by year according to the actual situation of each province and city. The reorganization of local education funds and the universal restoration of education bureaus are also being actively handled.</p>
<h3>Kunming Student Movement Tends to Expand, Student and Police Conflicts</h3>

Although the government authorities and the schools have repeatedly given sincere advice and guidance, it has been to no avail. After Liu Ying Shi, a special advisor from the Ministry of Education, came to Kunming, he consulted with the provincial authorities several times and sent unarmed military police to enter Yunda and Nanjing schools separately in the early morning of the 15th for final advice. At that time, the students gathered by drumming, and the situation became particularly tense. The two sides finally clashed.

<h3>Official Explanation from the National Bank Regarding Foreign Exchange for Self-Funded Students: Both First and Second Cohort Students Will Be Handled at Official Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A spokesperson from the Central Bank committee responsible for reviewing foreign exchange applications for self-funded students stated that since the recent revision to the foreign exchange control regulations, which introduced foreign exchange settlement certificates, there has been considerable misunderstanding among self-funded students regarding the purchase of foreign exchange. The following clarification is provided: (1) Self-funded students who have passed the Ministry of Education's first and second cohort examinations, upon approval of their foreign exchange application, regardless of whether they have already departed the country, are entitled to purchase foreign exchange at the official rate, and are not required to provide a foreign exchange settlement certificate. (2) The term "scholarship students" who purchase foreign exchange at the official rate does not refer to any student who has received a scholarship from a foreign university. It specifically refers to scholarship students approved by the Ministry of Education for overseas study. This means that the student has already received a scholarship from a foreign university or educational institution before leaving the country, and the Ministry of Education has also approved their departure based on this qualification, and they are currently continuing to receive the scholarship from the foreign university or educational institution. Generally, self-funded students who receive scholarships from foreign universities or educational institutions after going abroad cannot be treated in this manner and must still purchase foreign exchange at the official rate plus a foreign exchange settlement certificate. (3) According to the Ministry of Education's explanation, there have been no scholarship students approved for overseas study since the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on March 14, 1947. Any such scholarship students approved for overseas study after this date will not be allowed to apply for the purchase of foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Introducing Academic Institutions: Private Great China University</h3>
<p>History: In June 1924, more than 300 students from Xiamen University left the school en masse due to inappropriate measures by the authorities, and remedial actions proved ineffective. Fearing that they would have to discontinue their studies midway and betray their initial aspirations, they sent representatives, including Sun Kangzeng and Ni Wenya, to Shanghai, requesting nine former Xiamen University professors, including Ou Yuanhuai and Wang Yuxiang, to establish a new school so that they could continue their education. In September, the new school was organized and named "Great China University." It temporarily used the premises at 201 Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai as its campus, and officially started classes on September 22nd. On November 22nd, the Board of Directors elected Dr. Ma Junwu as President and Mr. Wang Boqun as Chairman of the Board. In March 1928, in accordance with the school regulations promulgated by the University Council, the position of Chairman of the Board was changed to Chairman, and the position of President was reinstated, with the addition of a Vice-President. Wang Boqun was elected as Chairman and President, and Huan Yuanhuai as Vice-President. In the spring of 1929, more than 100 acres of land were purchased next to Zhongshan Road in Fanhuangdu. In May of the same year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to the school for inspection and deemed that it was well-managed, granting it official registration. In the autumn of that year, active preparations were made for the construction of a new campus. Former President Ma Junwu and Ou Yuanhuai and Wang Yuxiang traveled south in the summer heat to raise the first phase of construction funds from overseas Chinese in Malaya, building the first phase of school buildings at a cost of more than 300,000 yuan. The buildings were completed in August 1930 and the school moved in in September. In 1931, a large number of books and instruments were purchased, and 300 acres of land were purchased for the school, a sanatorium was built, and various other constructions were planned. When the August 13th Incident suddenly broke out, Great China University and Fudan University jointly formed the First and Second Joint Universities in Lushan and Guiyang, respectively. Later, as the war situation deteriorated and the national army moved west, the Guling campus moved inland to Guiyang. More than 1,000 acres of land were purchased in Hua'ao, 20 miles from Guiyang, and Great China University was designated as a permanent campus, building six or seven school buildings. At that time, President Wang Boqun maintained the school with illness, and suddenly developed stomach cancer, passing away on December 26, 1944. Chairman of the Board, Sun Zhesheng, immediately convened a board meeting and elected Ou Yuanhuai and Wang Yuxiang as President and Vice-President, respectively. At the beginning of the war, the Shanghai campus was unable to move inland due to the obstruction of most faculty and students at sea. In 1938, a branch school was established in the isolated city of Shanghai, borrowing the Hongyi Middle School on Jing'an Temple Road as a temporary campus, and continuing teaching in a difficult environment. This continued for six years until victory. In the autumn of 1945, after the Japanese surrendered, the school returned to its old site on Zhongshan Road in Shanghai. However, the campus, which covered more than 400 acres, suffered significant damage during the war. The scenery along the Liwa River was completely changed, and the once magnificent buildings were reduced to rubble.</p>
<p>Current Status: The school currently has five colleges: Arts, Science, Law, Commerce, and Education. In the last semester, there were more than 2,800 students, of which the College of Education is unique in Shanghai, with more than 300 students. The deans of the five colleges and the heads of the departments are as follows: Dean of the College of Arts: Du Zuozhou, Head of the Department of Chinese Literature: Cheng Junying, Department of Foreign Languages: Chen Mingen, Department of History, Geography and Social Sciences: Su Xishi. Dean of the College of Science: Shao Jialin, Head of the Department of Mathematics and Physics: Zhou Changshou, Department of Chemistry: Chen Jingqi, Department of Civil Engineering: Wang Xing. Dean of the College of Commerce: He Yichao, Head of the Department of Accounting: Gong Qinghao, Department of Banking: Cai Wenxi, Department of Business Administration: Guan Kebui. Dean of the College of Law: Zhang Junqing, Head of the Department of Law: Lin Wopeng, Department of Political Science: Ge Shouyuan, Department of Economics: Han Wenchuang. Dean of the College of Education: Huang Jingsi, Head of the Department of Education: Tao Yuchuan, Department of Educational Psychology: Zhang Yaoxiang, Department of Social Education: Zeng Zuozhong.</p>
<p>Admissions: Private Great China University will hold two rounds of entrance examinations for new students this fall. The first round of examinations will be held on July 22nd and 23rd. The second round will be held on August 23rd and 24th. The deadline for registration is three days before the examination date. The examination venue and registration location is the school at 307 Zhongshan North Road. The enrollment quota is 40 to 50 new freshmen per department in the Colleges of Arts, Science, Commerce, Law, and Education, and a number of transfer students in the second and third grades.</p>
<h3>After the Reorganization of the National Sports Federation, Sports Associations are Established in Various Places: Branch Federations Will be Reorganized and Merged</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Since the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association resolved to change its name to "Republic of China Sports Association" at the board meeting held in Shanghai in May of this year, the fundraising and operation of the association after the reorganization have been delayed because the important officers of the association, standing directors, and general secretaries have gone to England to participate in the World Games. The work will begin actively after the return of the members. It is reported that the members of the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association in various places have proposed establishing association branches in various places, so some places have both a sports association branch and a sports association. According to the relevant officials of the National Sports Commission of the Ministry of Education: In the future, the Republic of China Sports Association will only set up a general association and will not set up branches, because the sports cause is from the bottom up, not from the top down. For example, the Republic of China Sports Association is located in Nanjing, and Nanjing only has a sports association, not a sports association branch. The Nanjing Sports Association should carry out various sports activities and proceed automatically at any time according to the needs of the environment, and it is not instructed by the association before it can be promoted. By analogy, since there will be no sports association branches in various places in the future, those associations that have already been established in various places should be reorganized into sports associations to comply with the law and avoid duplication.</p>

<h3>A Turning Point</h3>
<p>— Shuo Fu</p>
<p>One day these past few days, I took the 24 trolleybus from the Central District to the former French Concession. After the trolleybus reached Simar Road, the seat I was sitting on was already scorching hot from the sun. If I were to stand up, the bus would be so crowded that there would be no room to stand, but in my heart, I was silently hoping that as long as the bus turned a corner, the sun would no longer be shining directly on me, and it would be relatively cooler.</p>
<p>This psychological expectation of the trolleybus turning a corner is similar to our situation in a stagnant situation, waiting for a turning point. Although the sky is full of haze, there will eventually be a day of clearing. Moreover, people always think of things in a good way. "Another village" does not necessarily have the beauty of "a glimmer of light after passing through the dark willows," but we always dream of the realm of "a glimmer of light after passing through the dark willows."</p>
<p>Recently, everyone seems very uneasy because of the soaring prices. This may be an inevitable phenomenon in extraordinary times. In fact, in a changing era, this is just an interlude promoted by the objective environment. There is no lack of precedents in Chinese and foreign history. For example, during the American Revolutionary War, the value of currency plummeted. A section in a book records:</p>
<p>"In the summer of 1780, the common currency was despised. As Washington put it, to buy a cartload of goods, you had to prepare a cartload of banknotes for her. At the end of 1778, American dollar bills in the northern states were worth only one dime and six cents, and in the southern states they were worth only one dime and two cents. By the beginning of 1780, the currency value had fallen to two cents. Before the end of the year, it got worse and worse, so that ten paper dollars were worth only one cent."</p>
<p>The same book also said:</p>
<p>"In October of that year, the wholesale price of grain in Boston was $150 per bushel, $12 per pound for white tower salt, $90 per pound for tea, $10 per pound for sugar, $8 per pound for beef, $12 per pound for coffee, and $1,575 per barrel for flour. A man named Samuel Adams spent $2,000 to buy a hat and a suit of clothes. Before long, the currency stopped circulating, debts could not be calculated, and the credit system was completely destroyed."</p>
<p>The economic chaos in the United States at that time was truly unimaginable, but later the American Revolution was successful, and under the management of Finance Minister Hamilton, currency credit was restored, laying the foundation for future prosperity. I think that under the various active measures of the government authorities, a turning point is bound to come. When the economy stabilizes in the future, talking about the current situation will be like a nightmare.</p>
<h3>Master and Madam</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>At the end of the dying Qing dynasty, I took up a teaching position. At that time, schools were called "academies," teachers were called "instructors," and school workers were called "errand runners." Errand runners called instructors "master." As a young man in my early twenties, standing among a group of "standard masters," I had no choice but to allow people to call me "master" and respond casually, but I always felt very uneasy! After the Republic of China was established, the title of "master" was abolished in schools and replaced with "teacher," which made me feel greatly relieved. Although some people in society still used the title of master, fortunately I had not yet reached the eligible age, so it had nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that some people actually call themselves "master." For example, when returning home late and knocking on the door, if the servant asked who it was, the answer would be "I am the master." It is not known when the title of "master" began. According to Yu Quyuan's Small Collection, it is recorded in the Biography of Dong Boxiao in the History of the Yuan Dynasty, "I am Master Dong." Checking the History of the Yuan Dynasty, Dong made this statement after being captured alive by Zhu Gui's soldiers and being asked who he was. He replied, "I am Master Dong," and then was stabbed to death by the crowd. This is the self-proclaimed master seen in official history. The same book also quotes Xu Mengxin's Compilation of the Three Dynasties' Northern Alliance in the Song Dynasty, saying that there was a military rebellion in the Yumo Mountain stronghold, and the commanding generals Wang Lin, Meng Gen, Zhang Yatu, etc. killed their commander "Master Ma." This is the title of "master" seen in unofficial history. Considering the various sources, it is known that the title of "master" already existed between the Song and Yuan dynasties, and both Dong and Ma were military personnel. It seems that this title was limited to military positions, and it is impossible to know whether civil servants also used this title.</p>
<p>"Madam" is the spouse of "master." This refers to how people call them today. If you want to prove it in "ancient times," it seems quite difficult. Historically, it is recorded that Emperor Ai of Han honored his grandmother, Empress Dowager Fu of Dingtao Gongwang, as Empress Taetae, and later as Empress Huang Taetae. This is the first time the two characters "taetae" were used together, but this was a royal honorific. The practice of officials and civilians respectfully addressing each other as "madam" may have evolved from the royal honorific. This title is much more "ancient" than master.</p>
<h3>The Story of the "Baby Carriage"</h3>
<p>— Liu An</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, there was an inventor in the United States named Ban Deng. Seeing that women were struggling to carry their children out, he had a flash of inspiration and invented the "baby carriage" for children to sit in.</p>
<p>However, his new invention was not only unwelcome, but was even attacked by men and women across the country! An editorial in a women's magazine said, "The baby carriage snatches the lovely child from the mother's arms, and there is no greater harm to the love of family." Men cursed even more fiercely, saying that baby carriages could simply destroy family happiness. One eloquent orator said: "If children sit in baby carriages, mothers can often go to places far away from home! I wonder what is in her heart!"</p>
<p>Ban Deng was so reviled by them that he had no place to live and had to flee from New York to Europe. At this time, things finally turned around for the better. Queen Victoria of England and Queen Isabella of Spain both liked the baby carriages he made, and everyone bought them for the princes and princesses to sit in. From then on, the baby carriage was officially popularized in the world.</p>
<h3>On the Play "Selling the Horse"</h3>
<p>— Xuezhai</p>
<p>"An Odd Reunion" is a Yiyang opera. It is said that the script came from the imperial court. Later, everyone followed the performances of Wang Lengxian and Chen Delin as the standard. Its exquisiteness is almost impossible to describe. Among those who inherited the art of these two, Hongdou Guan Master got all of Wang Lengxian's skills, and Jiang Miaoxiang also got seventy to eighty percent of them. Miaoxiang initially learned the role of female from Delin, and was renowned as the best among his peers at the time. Later, due to vocal cord problems, he switched to playing young male roles. Delin and Lengxian often paired up in male and female roles. Lengxian's gestures, voice, and appearance were all heard and seen by Miaoxiang, allowing him to learn the role of Zhao Chong in "An Odd Reunion." However, in the scene of "Breaking Through the Barracks," young male actors often rely on a bold and unrestrained performance to achieve a good effect, which Delin was unfamiliar with since he did not share the stage with young male actors. At that time, there was a martial artist named Ru Laiqing, the ancestor of Ru Fulan, who was advising Miaoxiang on the martial arts aspects of "Eight Great Hammers" at the Yaguan Building. He greatly admired Wang Lengxian and made sure to watch all his plays, both martial and civil, understanding them deeply. He was able to fully grasp the gestures of Zhao Chong in the "Breaking Through the Barracks" scene. He then appeared in person to explain the scene to Miaoxiang. Therefore, those in the world who speak of "An Odd Reunion" believe that, apart from Pu Wu, only Miaoxiang fully captured the spirit of Wang Lengxian. As for plays that involve intimate banter and subtle expressions of love, only Kunqu opera can fully convey their nuances and extreme charm. However, the boundary between Kunqu and Yiyang opera is very strict, and incorporating Yiyang into Kunqu is quite incompatible. Judging by style, Yiyang belongs to the "Flower Department" and is a type of "Clapper Opera," while Kunqu belongs to the "Elegant Department," naturally having a distinction between elegance and vulgarity, like the Jing and Wei rivers that cannot be mixed. For example, Han Junqing and Bai Yunsheng, who are veterans of Yiyang opera, when they try to sing Kunqu, the awkward and incompatible parts of their breathing and vocal rhythms are clearly undeniable, which can serve as evidence. However, in the early years of the Republic of China, the Kunqu opera troupe in Shanghai called Xin Le Fu, although talented people emerged, the traditional repertoire such as "Pipa Record," "Eternal Life," and "Jade Hairpin" were too familiar and could not captivate the ears of Shanghai people. Therefore, plays like "Double Pearl Record," "Selling Rouge," and "Fifteen Strings of Cash" emerged, and Li Yu's works were also regarded as new sounds and were repeatedly staged. It was at this time that "An Odd Reunion" entered the Kunqu stage with Yiyang melodies. The singing was based on seven-character and ten-character lines, without fixed melodies but with interludes. The dialogue was colloquial and straightforward, without the elegant and beautiful charm of Kunqu opera, but it was precisely its simplicity and accessibility that pleased the people of the time. Those with little knowledge even regarded it as the same as Kunqu opera, unaware that it was Yiyang opera. Although this was due to changing customs, it also showed that the "Under the Willow" style was popular, and it could not be explained by reason. [Editor's Note: This is the language of a true connoisseur, a quick discussion that can be followed by a large drink.] Yu Zhenfei, from a prominent Jiangnan family, promoted the study of opera and became a professor at the Xin Le Fu Kunqu opera troupe. He liked the script of "An Odd Reunion" and did not despise its Yiyang roots. He often staged it, incorporating the elegant and refined vocal and physical expressions of Kunqu opera into the Yiyang melodies. Its beauty was almost unparalleled, and he quickly gained fame. Compared to the art of Hongdou and Miaoxiang, which originated from Lengxian, and Lengxian was also a Kunqu opera performer, Zhenfei entered the opera world later and, through the play "An Odd Reunion," greatly enhanced his reputation, overshadowing young male actors from the north. Alas, it was indeed a great success! However, in terms of Kunqu opera, those who can perform the official male roles in "Library," "Meeting Mother," and "Sudden Change" are generally superior to Zhao Chong in status. But this can only be said to those who understand, even if it is said to common people. Since Zhenfei became famous with this play, those in Jiangnan who perform it have all changed its name to "Selling the Horse," which also shows the trend of the time. Xun Huisheng also once re-edited this play, starting from Li Qi's loss of his wife, followed by his remarriage to Yang Sanchun, and Li Qi selling horses, Yang's evil plan to drive away his first wife's children. The character Gui Zhi and Bao Tong were first played by children, until the two were rescued separately, Gui Zhi marrying Zhao Chong, and Bao Lei being appointed to a high position. Although the plot seemed clearer, the problem of being lengthy was unavoidable. In "An Odd Reunion," the "Crying in Prison" and "Writing the Complaint" scenes already clearly narrate the past, and the story is well known. If the past is repeatedly staged, it will only bore the audience. The role of Li Baoyi was originally played by second-tier young male actors. In the past, when Hongdou Guan Master performed as an amateur, and when Zhu Suyun was in Mei Lanfang's troupe, Jiang Miaoxiang volunteered to play the supporting role, because Hongdou and Suyun were disciples of Miaoxiang, which also showed respect for the elders. However, after 1945, when Huang Guiqiu and Mei Lanfang performed this play in Shanghai, Yu Zhenfei played Zhao Chong, and Jiang Miaoxiang was forced to play Bao Tong. Miaoxiang's seniority was before Zhenfei's, and critics said that he was brave in promoting younger generations while disregarding his status, not knowing the reason. Jiang was a person who always repaid kindness, and he had received Zhenfei's help in a certain matter, so he repaid him by playing the role of Bao Tong. Who knew that this would become a precedent, and people in the opera world and the audience came to believe that "Selling the Horse" would be incomplete without Miaoxiang's Bao Tong, which would be a great disappointment. Although it was a consolation in his old age, Miaoxiang was nearly sixty years old. In terms of "An Odd Reunion," what he had indirectly received from Lengxian, and what was like a remaining cultural relic in the Lu Temple, was unexpectedly unrecognized and unexplored. Is this not a pity?</p>

<p>For thousands of years, people should count Lord Jiang of the Jiang family,</p>
<p>Truly seeing extravagance used to become a Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The misty moonlights of the Six Dynasties are all desolate,</p>
<p>Countless green mountains escorting the horse's hooves.</p>
<p>The child points and explains that it's Jiang Zong of Liang,</p>

<h3>Changing Trains</h3>
<p>— Xu Gan</p>
<p>The house I live in now is not far from the earliest railway laid in China. Whenever a train comes and goes, I can not only hear it, but also see it; however, what I see is not the train itself, but the glass on the doors and windows that rattles and shakes as the train passes.</p>
<p>This happens more than a dozen times a day, so that guests who happen to experience this will notice it and say to me, "Sitting in your room is like sitting in a train car."</p>
<p>Yes, even if I am not in a room like this, I have always felt like I am on a train, changing from one train to another, from one car to another. Some people spend their entire lives lying on a solid and stable bed, but they still end their lives. That motionless bed is still being pulled forward by a train engine, slowly and quietly.</p>
<p>They don't stop at any stations along the way, they don't get off the train, and they arrive; they are fortunate. I am not such a fortunate passenger.</p>
<p>I am about to change trains again.</p>
<h3>American Snippets</h3>
<p>— Xiansi</p>
<p>Among the past American presidents, three are most revered by the British, and statues have been erected in London to commemorate them. These three presidents are: George Washington, the founding father of the United States; Abraham Lincoln, the liberator of slaves; and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united democratic countries to defeat fascism.</p>
<p>The national flag flying on the roof of the U.S. Capitol has been changed to be made of "nylon," which is said to be more durable than cloth flags. In the past, when cloth flags were used, a total of twelve to fourteen flags were needed each year.</p>
<p>The exteriors of American trains have recently been mostly painted with a special paint that glows at night, like a luminous watch, so that drivers of speeding cars in the dark can see them from afar, reducing accidents.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania State University in the United States recently established a bone "bank," storing bones in extremely low-temperature ice cellars, specifically for surgeons to use when joining bones.</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Screenwriting</h3>
<p>— Huanren</p>
<p>We are currently facing a very turbulent era. Taking the film industry as an example, last year, films such as "Fake Phoenixes and Real Dragons" caused a stir because they involved plotlines about barbers. Therefore, playwrights and filmmakers, learning from previous lessons, have to be extremely cautious and deliberate repeatedly when writing or filming, fearing that they might offend a certain aspect and face severe interference. This kind of external interference is not only happening in our country, but now, even Hollywood screenwriters are feeling this pain. In addition to government agencies and the House Un-American Activities Committee, they also face formal or informal scrutiny from certain moral organizations. Those who write screenplays are almost always in the wrong. In a May issue of "Screenwriter Weekly," there was an advertisement offering a large sum of money for screenplay material. This advertisement precisely reveals the infinite suffering that Hollywood screenwriters feel due to constant external interference. Now, I will translate this advertisement below:</p>
<p>"A writer is seeking novel material for writing a screenplay, the content of which must avoid politics, religion, divorce, double beds, drugs, illness, poverty, alcohol, congressmen, bankers, cigarettes, wealth, Congress, race, economics, art, death, crime, childbirth, accidents (airplanes or cars); and the nationality of the villains in the play cannot be American, European, South American, African, Asian, Australian, New Zealander, Eskimo... not even dogs. Applicants please contact Box Thirteen."</p>
<h3>Against Eschatology</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>According to modern scholars, Zhao Zichen's "Biography of Jesus" estimates that Jesus was actually born in 7 BC and crucified on April 7, 30 AD, at about midday. If the calculation of his birth year is correct, the "Son of Man" was on earth for no more than thirty-seven years. Jesus lost his father at the age of nineteen. His mother witnessed his suffering at Golgotha; John's Gospel does not mention how his mother grieved, truly knowing that no one knows a son like his mother. Zhao's book has many new ideas and is written in a lively style, different from the usual religious texts. Its main point is to deny that Jesus was an eschatologist, arguing that Jesus was not a follower of eschatology but an abolisher of it. He said, "Resurrection, judgment, and the end of the world are certainly what Jesus believed in; but if eschatology speaks of the kingdom of God as something that has not yet come but will come suddenly, and when it comes, the world will be judged, Israel will be restored, and God's wrath will be poured out on all who are sinful; Jesus' teachings are very different from these teachings. Zhao believes that "Jesus himself is the life of resurrection, whether people believe or not is a judgment, and the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is the judge." This argument inspires me and allows me to reread the New Testament. How can those who stick to the old ways understand this?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from the Pavilion Where Rats Peep</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>Summer in Chengdu (Part 2)</p>
<p>There are few rivers and canals in Beijing, so the puddles of Shichahai are cherished by Beijingers. In summer, stalls selling tea are set up, and tens of thousands of people gather like ants, creating an indescribable commotion. (The same is true for Beihai.) Chengdu, on the other hand, has crisscrossing streams, and people set up small stalls everywhere, placing low chairs and selling Tuo tea with sincere charm, enough to make people while away an afternoon. Under the tall willows, people sleep soundly with their chests bared, undisturbed, without forcing the issue; this is the enjoyment of water.</p>
<p>The scale and grandeur of Shaocheng Park are certainly not comparable to Zhongshan Park in Beijing, but its simplicity and elegance match the overall style of Chengdu. We stroll through it and feel more in harmony with nature. Sichuan people have a widespread habit of drinking tea, and teahouses are everywhere. The park also mainly features these, selling pure tea and not iced water or melon juice, so the atmosphere is not ruined, which I like most.</p>
<p>Chengdu is a more conservative city, and it still preserves many of the Beijing court's styles in terms of food, drink, and clothing. I have already explained the reason for this. This is why people often say that it resembles Beijing. However, in recent years, Beijing has become poorer and can no longer maintain its old standards, while Chengdu still has ample resources. The Jisheng snack shop in the eastern part of the city specializes in selling high-quality summer snacks, making cakes from ripe cherries and soup from pickled tangerines, with excellent color, aroma, and taste. These are classic Beijing court dishes, while the snacks sold at Beihai Fangshan in Beijing at this time are already coarse and difficult to swallow.</p>
