<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院第二會期第十三次會議廿二日舉行，陳立夫主席，上午九時半開會，聆取報告事項二件，繼進行討論事項「立法院紀律委員會組織規程」，依法制委會草擬之草案逐條討論後，未有修正，卽予通過。旋因外委會對審查潘朝英等提請政府公布蘇聯違背中蘇友好同盟條約之事實，以正國際視聽，而明辯是非案所提出之報告，引起熱烈辯論。潘氏原提案列述蘇聯違反中美條約之事證，認為我國今日軍政，經濟之嚴重局面，大半由國際共黨陰謀造成，而外交措施軟弱，無力為正國際視聽及振奮全國民心，主張咨請政府，公布蘇聯違背中蘇友好同盟條約之種種事實，並向蘇聯提出嚴重交涉，如仍無效果，則向聯合國提出控訴。外委會審查時，曾邀外次葉公超，國副廳長葉南列席報告，並答覆質詢，經多次詳加討論後，決議報請院會先向政府提出質詢，唯潘氏及一部其他提案委員仍聲明反對，保留在大會發言，是以外委會報告經秘書人員宣讀，並由召集人張道行說明後，祁志厚，潘朝英兩氏卽提出反對意見，主張照原提案辦法通過，潘氏指出，政府省長曾數度公開承認蘇聯確有違背中蘇條約之事實，如對共匪作有限度之援助，阻撓接收大連，派遣飛機參加北塔山戰役，刦收東北廠鑛及任紅軍在東北及內蒙燒殺奸擄等，外部官員復曾在外委會答覆質詢，謂對蘇聯違約之事實，非至山窮水盡，不能正式公布，目前國際，國內局勢均極嚴重，實已至斷然公布是等事實之時期。渠並謂：如認為公布蘇聯違背事實卽將引起中蘇戰爭，實屬杞人憂天，然張慶禎隨卽表示反對，認為蘇聯違約事實早為眾週知，無再正式公布之必要，至公布後之對蘇嚴重交涉及向聯合國大會控訴兩步驟，衝諸國力世勢，恐亦無益，卽質詢亦不宜提出，蓋政府對蘇外交之不得已之苦衷，尤為人所洞悉，已不待對立院質詢提出答覆之說明，故主張該案保留。崔書琴則贊成外交委會之審查報告，渠強調公布蘇聯違約事實為一重要之外交步驟，其後應有強力有效之行動準備，第三次大戰雖未必能避免，但吾人決不能妄以戰爭為出路，更不能造次先為犧牲，故對外交行動之考慮，應極愼重，至聯合國力量如何，在否決權問題未獲解決前，此一問題提出後，亦難期有效後果，至午散會。下午三時半續會，陳茹玄復支持通過原案，渠追述兩年半以前立院同意批准中蘇條約時，認為該約雖忍辱負重，然可獲卅年之和平安定，是以忍痛承認，孰料卽此一平等條約亦不能為蘇聯眞正履行，今日共匪氣燄之高張及國內局勢之惡劣，皆蘇聯一手造成，渠指責外交軟弱，毫無政策，主張照原案之辦法，咨請政府公布蘇聯違約之事實，並向聯合國提出控訴，俾國人明瞭政府苦衷及共匪叛亂之眞正背景，而世界亦洞悉蘇聯之野心。張潛華則呼籲將此事訴者理性，對此一攤牌行為，應顧及其發生何種後果，主張全案保留，總計上下午發言及提出書面意見者約十餘人，最後余拯等停止討論之動機成立，表決結果，出席委員二六二人中，有二〇一人支持審查報告，遂決議向政院提出質詢案，案文：「自中蘇友好條約簽訂以來，蘇聯違背條約之事實層出不窮，迄今三年，不僅引起國內嚴重紛爭，且足構成國際危機，影響世界和平，政府已否準備如何措施，以維護條約尊嚴，確保國家主權，特提出質詢」。至五時開始討論國防委會報告召開擴大會議，檢討追究濟南戰事失利責任案案，以事關軍事機密經會眾同意，改開秘密會議，據立院新聞室息，本案照審查意見通過，改作質詢案，至六時許散會。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口廿二日電〕華中勦總副總司令徐祖詒將軍，廿二日午後招待記者，報告華中戰況，以興奮口吻，指出華中戡亂軍事，現已打破過去情勢，確切爭獲主動地位。豫南鄂北醞釀大戰，匪軍竄援企圖殆已完全入我白總司令之妙算掌握中。徐氏分析匪軍情況謂：劉匪自九月中旬卽調其一·二·三·四·六·九·十·十二等八縱隊，集結南陽東北地區，準備圍攻南陽，分製信陽至確山間鐵路沿繞，以策應山東陳匪之攻勢；嗣見我部署周密，恐遭聚殲，遂於十月初旬回竄禹縣，以一·三·四·三個縱隊分據舞場·方城南召，以二·六·十·十二·四個縱隊南竄平氏（泌陽南）湖陽，企圖避免決戰，並以攻為守，於本月十五日，以二·六兩縱隊南竄應山西北，不圖我軍早有戒備，當卽猛力反攻，匪軍受創甚重，只得於十七日向西潰退，刻匪二·六縱隊正竄據茅茨畈（隨縣西），十·十二·縱隊竄據棗陽以北地區，迄在我軍掌握兜剿中。論及半月戰績，徐氏稱：（一）江漢地區及大別山區已無大股匪軍，（二）國軍佔領泌陽後，劉匪主力被迫南北逃竄，現南陽與確山·遂平·西平間廣大地區已復為我控制。（三）隨縣棗陽收復後，劉匪主力一部已受極大威脅，刻勝利之柄已完全為我掌握，預料包圍聚殲日內卽可獲得更大捷報。</p>

<h3 id="c25">從南韓看亞洲的危機 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>南韓麗水的警察三千多人，突然於二十日發動叛變，以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，一鼓而佔領麗水與順天兩城，並號召全韓人民推翻成立不久的韓國政府。當時漢城立卽宣佈戒嚴，以防第五縱隊乘機活動，國防部長李範奭馬上派遣正規軍兩旅從全州馳往戡亂，當卽擊敗這批共黨領導的雜色叛軍，向求禮南撤，逃入山中。看大勢，韓國政府力能控制全局，當無問題；但南韓這次發生叛變，適在北韓蘇軍開始撤退之際，决非尋常事件可比。而且，這些雜色叛軍逃入山中之後，是否從此銷聲匿跡，，不復為南韓的後患也是一個嚴重的問題，至少在眼前局勢尙未完全澄淸之時，我們是不可妄下斷語的。</p>
<p>據路透社的報道，『若干方面對於南韓此次叛變，不信與北韓蘇軍撤退有關，也不信與南韓共黨活動有關，這些雜色叛軍，似乎不是南韓的共黨份子，事前旣無計劃，在佔領麗水順天兩城之後，又未鞏固其陣地，卽向南撤。』準此而論，南韓麗水警察的叛變，似乎還不是南韓共黨的作亂，而是一種政治示威運動。但由我們第三者看來，南韓發生叛變的內情，决不會如此的簡單，其含義實在不容我們忽視。</p>
<p>美國方面雖因美軍未牽入漩渦，對於此次叛變的態度非常持重，但國務院與陸軍部都密切注視南韓局勢的發展，並認為南韓情况萬一惡化，則駐南韓的美軍司令可立卽採取行動。僅以此一端而論　南韓的叛變不僅可能擴大為韓國的內戰，而且一個不小心，也有演變為亞洲全面戰爭之可能。我們並不願危言聳聽，但不能不指出我們最近在東北亞所看到的事實，以促起與遠東有關各國對於亞洲危機的警覺。</p>
<p>第一·南韓新政府成立未久，北韓急起直追，也組織了一個北韓政府，並立卽獲得蘇聯的承認，派史蒂柯夫為特別大使，聞將進一步締結軍事同盟，以為北韓與南韓抗爭的奧援。將來北韓與南韓萬一發生軍事衝突時，蘇聯就可以同盟國名義，予以軍事的援助·此外，，蘇聯又在外交上採取攻勢，首先宣佈蘇軍自北韓撒退，迫令美國駐花南韓的軍隊　須撤退回國。如此，整個朝鮮就可能落在蘇聯控制之下！蘇聯對於南韓　處心積慮，由來已久，不論在南韓的警察或軍隊之中，都潛伏着共黨的細胞，這次麗水警察叛變，實為熟悉朝鮮內情者的意料中事。</p>
<p>第二，目前英美的視綫，正集中在歐洲，為了柏林封釦事件，正欲利用聯合國安全理事會，譴責蘇聯封鎖的行為足以威脅世界和平，企圖與蘇聯實行攤牌。因此，蘇聯便乘英美忽視亞　的機會在東南亞及東北亞各國發動攻勢，以與中國境丙之共匪叛亂相策應。東南亞各國共黨勢力的活躍，本報社論早已論及：而今南朝鮮又突然發生叛變，其意義是完全相同的，就是蘇聯在背後要控制整個的亞洲。所以，這次南韓發生叛變，實為亞洲的警報，給英美只知共產勢力步步向西歐進迫而漠視亞洲危機者一個當頭棒喝。德國反共領袖將南韓叛變視為對德國的一種警吿，而認為將來德國也有成為今日朝鮮的可能，實含有無限的眞知與灼見。</p>
<p>第三，東北亞共產國際，早已在外蒙組織成立，共唯一的任務，就是要把朝鮮，蒙古，和我國的東北，組成　　「親蘇的緩衝地帶」。這一項的工作，刻正在積極進行之中，南韓這次發生叛變，正在東北共匪發動對長春錦州攻勢之際，相互呼應，就是它們執行此項任務的一個步驟。我們千萬不能等閑視之，而只目為朝鮮內部的政爭。</p>
<p>要之，共黨勢力旣已侵入東南亞各國，現又在東北亞發動攻勢，再加以我中國共匪叛亂的擴大，十足顯示出亞洲危機的深刻與嚴重。在亞洲各國，為本身的生存計，固應早日自覺，大家起來團結一致，速定自衛與更生的大計，就是與亞洲有關各國，尤其是英美，縱不為亞洲和平計，就是為了本身的利益，也應該高瞻遠矚，重行檢討其對外政策，早作「亡羊補牢」的打算了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市一般市民近日接到財政局繳納房捐通知書，其所列數字，最多增加數達五百餘倍之巨，市民莫不紛紛向財政局詢問眞相，財政局長田永謙爲使市民明瞭眞相，昨特向記者稱：目前之房捐直接採用「房屋總值」（卽全部房屋價值）爲征捐基數，比與以前以「估定租值」爲征捐基數者不同。房捐之捐率，前租界時代最高者照估定租值達百分之三十（其後尚再加五成附捐），最低亦達百分之十三。復員後之捐率，則爲營業用房屋照估定租價百分之十，住家用百分之五，此次改訂，爲照估定房屋總值，營業用兩捐（房捐與市政建設捐）共徵千分之十四，住家用兩捐共徵千分之八，兩捐各佔其半，故事實上捐率已減低。此次之易於引起市民誤會者，蓋在房捐與市政建設捐合併征收，通知書上僅書明總額而未予分別書明，在捐率方面，市參議會之決議係房捐市建捐各半，則負担上自係照章房主房客各半，毫無疑義。惟房捐須由住戶代繳以便徵收，凡此均係中央原頒條例所規定，並未更改，希望市民辨明。本市舊有之估定房屋總值，雖經科學詳密之程序，但輕重遺漏，或所難免，倘有此種情形發生，希望市民儘可向本局申請，重爲測量核估，俾臻平允。惟在未重估前，所有房建兩捐，仍希先行繳納。田局長又稱：預計本市郊區·鄉區·市區共二十餘萬戶，可征收房捐建設捐三百餘萬金圓，但是否能收足預算之數，月前尚難臆測。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　梁風</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿日航訊〕金風送爽的秋天，本來是南國一個最可愛的季節，這裏商場上有一句諺語：「五窮六艷七翻甦」，便是說一到了秋天，就一切都有生機了。但不幸得很，今年在深秋裏的一場風雨，卻很使人意外地，在市場上刮起了驚濤駭浪，一般物價，無不平地飛升，較「八，一九」時，竟漲達三倍至四倍，這種物價飛漲的速度，和市面混亂的情形，比之改帶前的歷次漲風，只有過之而無不及。一般小市民，固然惶惶不可終日，就負責經濟管制的當局，也大感應付困難，特價評議會，也有一兩個星期沒有舉行會議，大概因市場過於混亂，而使他們對物價也無從評議吧。</p>
<p>一個可怕的漏洞</p>
<p>本來，在改幣後的一個半月來，一般情勢還說得上安定，各地搶購的惡風，也尚未吹到廣州來。對於游資南流的問題，宋子文主席亦早已顧及，早在九月七日，即宜布限制匯款辦法，但這裏仍有一個漏洞，就是改幣後，財部已將過去攜帶國幣南下的限額禁令撤銷，這樣匯款難受限制，而攜帶金圓仍可自由，致穗經管處又須立即電請財部，迅予施行南下旅客，每人攜帶不得超過一千金圓之限制，可是公事往還，略需時日，當這辦法未奉實施前，那些敏感的滬，漢，湘，贛各地商人，竟乘着這一個機會，攜着大量那找不到出路的游資，沿粵漢路蜂湧南下。於是，這裏的高等旅店，完全給他們住滿，這裏的酒樓，舞場，到處都濟滿了這大批的「外江」豪客。他們有些有辦法的，將這些游資偷運到香港去，運不去的，就在廣州來搶購物資，他們根本就不論價格高下，秪求搶貨在手，由多至少，由鉅至微，到處搜刮甚至還延展到外圍的四鄉去搶購。像這樣成千成萬的游資湧來，已經瀕於窒息的廣州工商業，怎能抵擋得住呢？於是一般商店老板，看到了這班豪客，便將貨價拼命提高，甚至有些竟閉門謝客，而這批游資有部份買不到貨，竟向外幣入手了，因此使市場上便起了急激的反應，金融黑市活動，又再死灰復燃，大約在國慶日前兩三天，市場即開始騷動，到現在未及半月，而一般黑市物價已上漲三倍以上了。</p>
<p>黑市差額的存在</p>
<p>因為金圓和港幣有了黑市的差額存在，一般物價的成本，就和評定的公價，越離越遠。而廣州又是一個消費的市場，一切物資要靠外圍的四鄉來供應，政府嚴厲執行限價的結果，反使來途四鄉的貨物趦趄不前，商人們見來源稀疏，也就不輕易放出存貨。再加上一些沒良心的奸商，乘機囤積居奇，因此形成日用必需品奇形缺乏。除了米糧略為穩定之外，其餘如生油·柴薪·豬·羊·魚等肉類，以及於菜蔬，均幾乎絕跡於市場。使連日以來，家庭主婦，誰都有無菜可買之嘆，這使無知的市民，幾以為敵人的大軍將要壓境一般，人心浮動，一片風聲鶴唳，而經管當局，也就因此面臨着一個嚴重的難題。</p>
<p>投機家有機可乘</p>
<p>這次金融物價的劇烈波動，據一般專家指陳，除了因為游資大量侵襲之外，還有着：（一）收兌外幣延期，予金融投機家以機會，（二）戰事影響，（三）走私依然猖獗，（四）奸商囤積操縱，（五）政府限價與物資調節未能配合等幾個重要的因素。宋主席更指出：物資上揚主要原因，由於金圓券的兌換率，與廣州原來的外幣黑市相差太遠，而政府規定以「八·一九」物價為水準，致黑市價漲實為「不可避免」。</p>
<p>經管當局對目前這種惡劣的情勢，曾先後訂定或已實施的，計有如下幾種辦法。對金融方面：（一）竭力遏止游資南流，（二）私營電臺電訊擾亂金融及買賣外幣一律處死刑，（三）金銀業從業員自十月十五日起，一律不得持有外幣，（四）在機場，輪船，旅店，行莊嚴厲檢查外來商人，凡檢獲外幣即予兌換金圓，超過一千圓者扣押。對物價方面：（一）使各地物資調和，（二）限制物資外運，（三）加緊管制糧食，（四）提前配售日用必需品，（五）登記存貨與檢查倉庫，（六）嚴厲取締奸商，（七）限令商店不得無故停業，（八）加強緝私等。</p>
<p>「王道」與現實環境</p>
<p>上列這種種措施，本來可說是對癥下藥，計劃說得上周全，而經營負責人員，亦可謂盡了最大的努力。宋主席曾函復立法院五立委，對指責其執行緊急經濟計劃不力之說，予以否認。但這裏仍有人認為：宋氏難甚努力，計劃亦至周全，但對各種計劃的執行，仍感其不夠迅速與嚴厲。彼等認為宋氏以「王道」手法，實不足以解決當前的問題，據說某次宋氏曾召集本市的金融業領袖，嚴厲誥誡，霍實樹亦當場宣佈：渠已破獲三十餘個私設電臺，拿獲不少經營黑市買賣證據，如各人仍不竭力將黑市遏止，則決不徇情矣。當時警局的黎局長亦在坐，當時各人亦嚇得滿頭大汗，但會散之後，金融黑市活動，竟又如常，所以一般人認為，雖然治亂世，用重典，也不一定是最佳的辦法。但廣州自改幣以來，檢獲擾亂金融及違反限價的案件，雖達數百宗，而受嚴厲處分者，實未多見，這便未免有對一般奸商姑息之嫌了！</p>
<p>無事變成有事了</p>
<p>不過話又說回來，這種市面混亂的形成，在政府當然責無旁貸，但照這次實際情形來看，一般人民亦應負很大的責任。一方面固然由於種種客觀的形勢，使物價波動劇烈，而人民不健全的心理，實最足影響一切經營措施的推行。在過去通貨膨脹，難怪人們對國幣歧視，但改發金圓後，不祗有十足準備，而且發行尚未足額，當更無膨脹的理由，而物資亦未至真正缺乏，情勢斷不至如人們所想的那般嚴重，一般人竟庸人自擾，搶呀！買呀！使一般商人拿着貨物，便認為奇貨可居了，不賣了，停業了，於是便無事變成有事，其實，大家正應鎮靜一點，體察事實，並拿出良心來，盡力協助政府，　固經濟管制，維持安定生活！</p>

<p>— 本報通訊員　朱向高</p>
<p>〔本報宜興十四日訊〕無可　言，中國農民較世界任何民族肯刻苦，能耐勞，他們是大地的硬漢，不但成年胼手胝足於農事生產，並能充分利用農閑，致力於副業，其生活醇厚樸實，蔚為多少世紀以來的好風氣，以記者的故鄉宜興來說，除了一片肥沃的農作外，春冬兩季的農閑，對他們的意義很大副產品在農村已有了根深蒂固的基礎，如紡花，蠢桑，以至打草紙—其中犖犖大者，即為陶窰制作。說起陶器宜興人都會自得地說不多見的特產，自早年代表國產陳列加拿大博覽會，頒得最優等獎狀以後，名噪海內外。富麗的客廳裏，都有宜興陶器的裝飾，雖然與景德瓷器同為碧眼兒視為珍品，可是被桎梏於不求進步墨守成法之中，迄未能在國際市場上爭取大量外匯，在科學日進的時代中國的手工業雖然不能說是已經沒落了，至少在走入下坡路。宜興陶業窰場的現況，正說明了在日新月異的科學時代，中國的手工業將處着怎樣嚴重的一個危機。</p>
<p>鼎蜀兩鎮</p>
<p>記者此次隨着當地報人一同搭專輪關往，九時許汽艇由內河入氿，碧波千頃，風帆點點，一望無際，戰前政府曾有整葺東西兩氿為公園之議，未幾即逢事變，現在當然無從說起，否則如加意整理，未始不可與西子湖媲美。十一時許抵蜀山鎮，捨舟登岸，徒步赴鼎山鎮，實地赴陶窰製場視察。遠在春秋戰國，范蠡攜西施避居過縣，自號陶朱公，宜興製陶即傳稱於世，即以范蠡計算，迄今已有二千餘年的歷史。記者圑一行二十餘人，先行視察製造陶器之原料，位於鼎蜀兩鎮街後，計有三個山頭，每個山頭，約佔地數十畝，高可三五十丈，西龍山位西，俗諺又稱西山，黃龍山位東，俗諺東山，與本山鼎足而三，故稱鼎山，位於蜀山腳下，即名蜀山鎮。</p>
<p>白泥場上</p>
<p>上述數山，分別生產青，黃，紫，各色泥土，另有離鼎山二十餘里，有一孤山專產白泥，俗諺為白泥場，即為全部製坯原料，供應來源，首先從山區將泥土運來後，先行用石碾由　力研碎，於研碾後，視粉末之粗細，計分別粗，溪，黑，黃砂，按等級分製缸，罎，罐，壺，以至細緻的茶具，須最上級之細泥，繼由水份調勻後，即可交技工按模型製造各式陶坯，即運晒場風吹，一俟乾透後，即上油彩，不久即可裝窰，那時即為全部工程最緊要之關頭，窰場即如一條條長短大小之蜈蚣，縱橫起伏，連綿不絕，埋伏於叢山疊嶺，鼎蜀人卻稱為龍窰。除下口即為正式出入之窰洞外，底面只有一圓洞，為全部煙煤灰燼出口處，背部左右，每隔兩尺，即相對挖有窰窗，陶坯進窰時，均按大小疊起，即如缸內分層安置罎，罐，以至茶具，自底端順序安放至洞口後，即將背部圓洞分別用泥閉塞，如窰所裝粗貨，則用松枝木柴，細貨用茅草，開始在所出入的窰洞燃燒。</p>
<p>看火技工</p>
<p>全窰之成敗，即須看用火之是否恰到好處，即由技術工人，不分晝夜駐守看火，至一時期間後，即將窰門用泥土封閉，即行開啓背部，左右第一對窗洞，復用燃料在第一對洞內焚燒，逐步順序而上，至最後一對窗洞為止。每條中窰，大約須一日夜工夫即可止炎，再須涼窰兩天，即可啓窰取貨。這全部工程製作之始末，其程序之分門別類，界限劃分至深，絕不紊亂分毫，即如作夜壺坯工人，一世只得作夜壺坯，別的東西，他決不能做。全部技工中，以看火工人為最重要，因其工作舉足輕重，關系到全窰的成敗。全部工人生活標準相當高，而尤以看火技工為最優厚，平均每人每天可得白米七斗，其餘工人最少也有四斗，龍窰的所有權，正如其他各地的地主一樣，視為生活的出息，能獨有條窰，即被稱為首富，大都均為三五家以至十數家合有一窰，一窰的成敗，影響窰戶生活至鉅，俗諺有云：「三窰窮，三窰富」，運窰不佳，即傾家蕩產，也司空見慣，以致環境逼使該區人民的信仰，趨向迷信，故進坯的時候，也難怪他們多帶着一重休咎的陰影。我們看完四個山嶺全部龍窰後，又趕到離鎮三里許之湯渡鄉視察該地以出缸罎着稱於時，窰築於平地，窰頂上均設有蔭棚，可避免夏秋驟然的陰雨，設備完善，出品也特別優良。鼎山鎮大率出產粗貨，如缸罐、罎、家庭日用品，蜀山鎮則產細貨，如茶具以至裝飾品，窰戶在燒窰時，最形緊張，用火非但須注意文武，尤不可發生中斷。據聞有一窰戶，初次燒窰，因燃料中斷，無法運濟，先砍劈自己家內門窗，後竟將床帳衣物也送進窰去。我們立在山頭上，只見成天均為炊煙四處，連綿不絕，故該地區空氣特燥，氣塵殊低，對人類生活頗多妨害，初來的人，極難忍受。</p>

<p>當我們訪問陶業公會時，他們表示對陶器前途俱有感到「老大徒傷悲」的情調，與戰前相較，大約只有七成光景。現據該會統計：全部技工約五千人，此外更有幾萬人靠此衣食。邇來生計難維，無力負擔這龐大的成本，因此有一半龍窰現已廢置，出品銳減，名手邵全童等為國振興，自組上袁壺缸生產合作社，集資數千石米，自產自銷，並有湯渡缸罎生產合作社，規模均頗宏大，該業即奉陶朱公為祖師，供奉在本山頂上窰神廟內，廟裏一無足觀，和其他荒無了的土地廟並無二致。</p>
<p>陶瓷學校</p>
<p>最後，我們又趕去看了看教廳設立的江蘇省立陶瓷學校，位在鼎蜀公路的中心，三面環水，環境是挺美麗的。據說原來的校舍已毀於砲火，現乃借用民主醫院作校舍，校長王世傑。現在學生計四十人，三年即可畢業。據說校內暮氣沉，學生對該業亦少興趣，一面當然也是環境使然，手工業的少出路，造成了每況愈下，戰前最盛時有過千餘學生，分普通專門，六年結業，如今雖經王校長慘淡經營，然仍難有起色。黃山頂上以前師生設計的一座新型模范窰，仍在吐着黑煙，算是戰前盛況的廻光。該區居民，將所燒壞的破漏的罎瓷，用石灰砌成房屋，既廢物利用，又堅靸耐久，街後窰戶，觸目皆是，這是他地所少見的獨特現象。</p>
<p>深夜二時，我們一行巡視了市區，這樣偉大的工業區，迄無電燈設備，真是奇蹟，店鋪均寥落，僅縣煤氣燈。時值深夜，行人似陸續不絕，三分之一的食舖，尚未熄火，沿街小吃攤，鱗比櫛次，比宜城是繁榮得多，在本鎮行銷的陶器店並不過多，菜館酒樓卻特盛，所有技工，因為收入多，每最於上工前必須吃得酒酣耳熱，至少得消費了所入的一半，而有一部蘇北工人，天生勤儉，收入雖豐，仍力事積薔。在另一方面，消費的要求量亦大，煙賭之風，比其他各區更盛，比其他各區也難禁。最後還值得一提的，是鼎蜀兩鎮間的一條公路，約三里許，既闊廣，且平坦，兩旁遍植垂柳，極目縱視，柳浪翩翩，頗繞詩情畫意，樹後缸瓷堆積如山，綿宜不絕，現勢所趨，誠令人不勝「美人遲暮」之感。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕最近因華南方面暗息高翔，造成本市資金大量南流。記者昨向江海關緝私科探詢緝查旅客攜帶現鈔情形，據告：赴粤旅客，每人限攜一千圓之規定，海關甫於廿一日公告施行，故公告前並無限制。惟過去數週間，尚無攜運鉅額現鈔南下之事件發生。聞運鈔旅客，大多取道粤漢鐵路南下云。</p>

<p>八月份全國進出口貿易數字，業經海關總稅務司署統計竣事。進口貨物凈值法幣一百廿五萬九千二百六十二億三千五百四十七萬三千元，出口貨物凈值法幣一百零一萬零三百七十八億八千二百九十七萬九千元，進出口相抵，計入超法幣二十四萬八千八百八十三億五千二百四十九萬四千元，較之七月份出超數法幣十七萬二千五百十九億七千四百六十萬六千元，相反陡增法幣四十二萬一千四百餘億。</p>
<p>查本年一月至八月，除七月份為出超外，其餘各月均為入超，茲將本年各月份入超數字法幣額列後：</p>
<p>一月份入超三四，一七三，四六八萬元。二月份入超二四，四五五，〇八四萬元。三月份入超三〇四，二三七，八三四萬元。四月份入超二五八，七七五，一一八萬元。五月份入超五一五，六〇二，一五〇萬元。六月份入超一三，九八三，六一九萬元。連同上列八月份入超，與七月份出超額相抵，本年一月至八月，尚總共入超法幣二十一萬一四千百八十六億五千零六十二萬元。</p>

<p>〔本報北平二十二日電〕胡適今由滬飛返平，與記者談及數事：（一）關於訪日問題，渠稱非如邵毓麟所說之肯定，明年如有時間走一趟，該時局鯁生將同往。對於日本學習民主程度，胡氏引李濟之言「觀其國民投票情形之佳，比我們也許更切實得多」。（二）明年三月去澳洲，為期一月，參觀其國內七大學，藉以增進對太平洋上國家之瞭解。有機會並欲赴紐西蘭一行。胡氏贊舉澳洲紐西蘭民主制度，社會立法，皆達上乘，而為太平洋上之先進國。（三）渠此次帶回了一件寶貝，即商務印書館所珍藏的永樂大典中的前半部水經注。胡氏稱此為最好最全的珍本，下半部為高陽李石曾之姪李玄伯所藏，前年讓給北大。此次破鏡重圓，準備在北大五十週年，與其他數十種一併展覽。（四）對於財經改革，胡氏重述其意見，謂二個多月來利弊已見，政府應即廣請國內專家學者，加以研究，確定興革。因渠等非投機市場中人，觀點自由切當，並希北大清華皆有人參加。（五）論及大學經費問題，胡氏稱改幣前，薪金佔全經費百分九九，改幣後醫學院一系的研究費，只合美金七角五，院長因此辭職了。北大近有一具體提案，在京提經校長會議通過，並得教部同意，明年可能見諸實行。根據此提案，薪俸佔全部經費百分六〇，其餘百分四〇辦學校，以百分二〇做學術研究，百分十五做經常費，百分三普通講置費，百分二做臨時費。最後某記者詢胡氏在京曾談到大學南還問題否？胡氏擺手，謂此事最好不談起。</p>

<h3 id="c138">軋烟志感季用 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>這兩天報紙上不談軋的很少，甚至連火車都軋起來了，據說是有錢的闊少們唯恐失掉及「時」行樂的機會，趁百物尚未正式飛漲之時，到蘇杭走走。我住在蘇州，果然這兩天虎邱雪最均大熱鬧，今天本地報紙消息，連交通部某要員來吳遊玩，都軋不上火車，只得從郵車的窗子跳進去，權作一回郵件了。</p>
<p>不過這全不相干，感想是從今早我親眼看到的軋米軋烟兩個行列而生。蘇州雖是魚米之鄉，但如今買米只好論升，前天還可以每人配給五升，昨天則只有二升。唯今早我所見軋米行列，有兩特點，與軋烟者顯然不同（一）人數比較少；（二）都安安靜靜的排了隊，等候開門，有的女人則趁機織毛綫。軋烟的可就不得了了，一間店起碼有一二百人，有的人已竟立到別人的肩上，如搶如奪，毫無秩序。於是我心裏便盤算，莫非吃烟比吃飯還要緊嗎？可是看那些軋的朋友，絕不是「論語」中人，沒有一個帶書卷氣，想憑大砲台增加烟士披裏純的，反之，多半是短打階級，亦卽所謂黃牛也。這時我才恍然弄出一個大悟來，原來軋米是爲了吃，軋烟則爲了利；爲吃的人尚少，而且也還有點悠閒，爲利的人則多，同時不顧性命。</p>
<p>名　利鎖，本來使人無可奈何，但是到了飢餓的邊緣，大多數人還是趨向於利，這現象就值得研究。人類有史數千年，實卽一部鬥爭史。鬥爭的對象是什麼？簡而言之，曰「利」！爲了自己的生活固然是利，超過自己應享受的生活是更大的利，利之所在，不厭其大，卽便有等大之害隨之，也還是照樣無視與盲目。譬如天天有因抬價或舞弊而吃官司甚至被槍斃的人，可是社會上絕對不因此而减少抬價與舞弊，正在「抬」與「舞」的人，也萬不會因有所警惕而洗手。他們心裏比法官更懂法條，可是敵不住他們對金圓與享受的艶羨。曾有人說，歷史的進化是量的而不是質的，古時人爲了自己的利益而去侵犯他人，他部落，今人也還是如此，古人用的戈矛刀劍，今人用的是坦克飛機，如是而已。更有人說，人類文化，乃是獸類文化的延長，獸類用爪牙　毒去殘同類，人類則用種種武器以殺害同樣圓頗方趾之倫。這話也頗有意思。最近有人去訪問美國科學大家原子能的權威學者愛因斯坦博士，問他第三次世界大戰將用何種武器。他回答得很幽默：「第三次我不知，但我確知第四次。」問者驚問爲何，愛氏莞爾曰「用石塊。」他的意思無非是說，三次大戰，勢將使人類全部毀滅，所謂文化者，亦必不存分毫，於是世界復入於洪荒，人類仍歸於原始，那麼打起仗來，只好用石頭了。假定由此推之，焉知我們這幾十萬年文明，由「北京人」到原子彈時代，不是一百萬年以前就曾有過呢？只爲大家好利相爭，弄得渾沌又臨，真好像荘子裏所說的，悠忽一　渾沌之　，而渾沌死矣。人類自有好利心以後，人類就注定要滅亡了。</p>
<p>真怪，一切發明全首先利用於爲了自保衛自己利益或侵略他人利益的戰爭工具上。銅器時代之初，管子就說過：「良金以鑄刀劍，惡金以鑄鉏斤。」生產用的鋤頭，遠不如殺人的刀劍重要。諾貝爾發明無烟火藥，本爲開山採礦，不料却用以供大砲機槍。愛因斯坦的原子能也讓日本鬼子先嘗爲快，而且如今成了舉世要搶奪的秘密，弄得這老頭子大發牢騷。有人說，原子能不久卽可用於工業界，我的看法是，如果沒有更新的武器替代他，決不會有把他用到生產上之可能。他就是今日之「良金」，而只有「惡金」才用來生產的呀！也就好比黃牛黨得以最大的努力去軋烟，行有餘力，才用以軋米。</p>
<p>如果我是當局，我一定開放香烟，價錢隨意上漲，而賣成烟廠每天抽出若干箱，專門免費配給作家，由各出版機關代爲分發。否則，米和烟一齊限價，但買烟之後，不許再買米。不過後一辦法，未免苦了好抽烟的朋友，如則仕先生之流，那就仍以第一法爲妥。（編者按：則仕先生在本談曾發表「談紙」一文，謂烟已成爲日常必需品之一。）</p>
<h3 id="c139">素食論 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>這幾天，我們都被迫作爲素食主義的奉行者了。</p>
<p>無論佛敎徒與衛生論者怎樣宣傳吃素是有益身體的一件事，無論蕭伯納氏的長壽是得力於他的力行素食，無論理學家攻擊食肉者爲鄙人，我總不相信人類是應該吃素而不應該吃葷。因此這幾天的吃素，我們確具有不得已的心情，只希望這種反常的局面可以早日廓清而已。</p>
<p>從實際情形推測，魚肉雞蝦之類的葷腥，不是匱乏，問題是供應的不正常。何以在許多大餐館裏，照常有魚有肉，而在小菜場中是絕無而僅有？僅有的一些，必須要從清早六時起就排隊守候，一直到八時才可以開始發買，每人身上必需用粉筆寫好號碼，其情形說得淒慘一點，有如囚犯領糧，然而這份「口糧」，還是要用錢來交易而退的。</p>
<p>素食主義如其行得通的話，則乾脆還是讓全世界的人吃一種可以避免饑餓的維他命丸，有如我國古代傳說的長生不老之丹，不吃人間烟火食，何等爽快與便利？事實上人類的吃東西，除了填飽肚子以外，還需要一點滿足最低限度的口腹之慾。當然「易牙之味，有同嗜焉」，我們在此提倡節約時代，不是想宣傳山珍海味的美饈，也不想敎萬戶人家都屬鐘鳴鼎食，至少限度也得讓人們獲得一點營養，使這些原是瘦　的人民還有一些補養體力的食物。</p>
<p>當世界運動會在倫敦揭幕之日，我們的選手吃些什麼呢？皮蛋與罐頭食物，據說還有一點火腿。但是與英美各國選手的食物比較起來，我國的選手便瞠乎其後，營養的補給旣差，競技的角逐就難以與人爭勝。然而我相信中國選手在海外所吃到的東西，還是算上等的了，在國內不是粗茶淡飯？身體的營養，決非一朝一夕所能奏效，你要強壯的體格，你就得從早注意到關係身體健康之一的營養。</p>
<p>絕對的素食主義與絕對葷食主義一樣是行不通的。通常我們的食物，大都是葷素兼備，相互發爲效用的。我們故鄉有句成語，說「飯爲根本肉爲標」，意思是指一個人的營養，治標以肉，治本以飯。大部份中國人不吃魚肝油，不打補針，沒有散拿吐瑾與多種維他命丸，其健康的維繫，端類肉肉飯飯而已。因此我的結論是：不贊成長期素食！</p>
<h3 id="c140">親臨菜場記 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 談客</p>
<p>爲了菜場上購不到要吃的菜，團體裏雇用的飯司務提出了「辭呈」：除非有誰陪同他去買菜，他一個人是決不上菜場了。同人等雖認爲上菜場麻煩，終於決定每天輪流着和飯司務上菜場：買什麼，怎樣去買，自己去決定；菜籃嗎，當然飯司務提。換句話說，提菜籃的飯司務是經常這一個，同他「搭檔」的便是輪值的了。</p>
<p>我沒有上菜場去買過菜，而今也要以主婦的姿態去嘗一嘗上菜場的滋味。這滋味實在不很好受：在菜　間兜圈子，打人叢中擠出路，走的是又濕又滑的地皮，嗅的是亦腥亦臭的氣味。買肉買魚，都得「站班」恭候，買到還算倖運，說不定前後一擁擠，滑倒在地上，那才遭呢！</p>
<p>排了一段總算短的隊，買到了魚，目光便移到蔬菜上去子。</p>
<p>一共只有那幾種蔬菜！雞毛菜不對胃口，白菜有蟲蛀的痕迹，蘿蔔又怕空心……不買嗎？回去怎麼交代？又吃些什麼？</p>
<p>「爲什麼好好的白菜都給蟲蛀了？」明知這問題毫無意義，但把白菜大翻一陣之後就走開，理由似欠充分，恐怕被罵，便來一個先發制人，以便安然引退。不料菜攤主人從從容容的說：「不蛀的都賣光了！你來遲了呀！」</p>
<p>我回頭要走，提籃子的飯司務提出抗議了：</p>
<p>「算了吧，不要多跑了，反正跑來跑去都是蛀菜了。」於是就和這一個蛀菜攤主成交。看一看腕上的手表，指着八時十六分。</p>

<h3 id="c143">廣州印象 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 紀穆</p>
<p>友人某君月前因事赴港，最近公畢，假道廣州返滬，爲我叙述在廣州的見聞，頗能予人生動與深刻的印象。</p>
<p>據說，廣州市區遠闊，人口密集，不在上海之下，房荒問題，尤爲嚴重，房屋絕少有　讓　事。市內通衢大道，寬廣平坦，路旁樓房，多伸出人行道外，有柱撑住，天雨時，在屋下步行，可不致爲雨淋濕，略與上海金陵東路一帶相仿。陋街小巷，則多轉灣抹角，罕有橫直交叉，四通八達者。</p>
<p>初蒞廣州者，發現當地若干建築物的屋頂，與路面的高低相等、甚至有低於馬路者，頗感新奇。事緣廣州地勢高低不一，有的馬路，係就低窪處填平，致有此現象。行人訪問該處居民，　須拾級而下。</p>
<p>語云：「吃在廣州」。廣州居民似對吃甚感興趣，無論中下之家，早餐均赴飲食店進食芝蔴糊魚生粥等小食，定價頗貴，而各食肆晨間門庭若市，莫不利市三倍。從飲食店中，復可窥出廣東人性格「硬朗」，不予通融的一般。如專售甜食的舖子，不售　食，反之亦然。此外，在同一店舖中，復規定上午供售某項點心，下午另售他項點心，如索取規定以外之點心，卽無法購得，此與滬上五芳齋這一類點心店售大肉麵魚麵等以外，視季節兼售菉豆湯糖山芋等物，頗有不同也。</p>
<p>廣州人對於衣着服鉓，則甚儉約而隨便。夏日以穿香雲紗掛褲及木屐者居多，卽洋車夫亦不能免，拖了木屐拉車，自然拉得很慢了。</p>
<p>廣州日用各物，如米，蔬菜，肉類，布疋等，均較上海昂貴，幣制改革以前，法幣膨脹過劇，市區買賣多以港幣爲準，但自頒行金圓劵後，市而業已穩定。港幣兌換金圓劵比率亦有規定，足見信用昭著，深得人民信仰。</p>
<p>談到廣州的女人，南國女兒，素當熱情，我友認爲她們塗抹得很厲害，如　黑眼圈，搽粉，點胭脂等。前人詩云：「淡妝濃抹終相宜」。廣州女人蓋屬於濃抹的一型也。</p>
<h3 id="c144">團員 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 聽之</p>
<p>一天，在澳洲阿德來特地方，有一個女人跨上公共汽車，想找一個位子坐下。那時，有一個男客便彬彬有禮的立了起來，把自己的坐位讓給她。她不在意地謝了一聲，正想坐下，忽然眼睛一瞥，看見了那個男子的面容，她突然慘呌了一聲「喬治！」不禁昏厥在地，不省人事。</p>
<p>原來，那個讓座男客正是她的丈夫，從軍之後，久無音信，據說早已陣亡了。</p>
<p>那個男客大吃一驚，跳了起來。那時，賣票員和別的乘客們已經趕過來照料那個女客，他們把她扶了起來。那個男客對了那個女人的面容衹是昏　地注視着，如醉如痴，像在一個夢裏一樣。慢慢的，他呆呆的眼睛裏有了活氣，他如大夢初醒，認清了這正是他久別的妻子。原來他在戰場上腦部受到了劇烈的刺激，得了病症，連他自己是什麼人，住在什麼地方，都已全部忘掉。一直到戰事結束，他還是那樣半昏迷的到處流浪，雖然　泊到了自己的家鄉，竟也毫不知覺。一直到這時候才清醒了過來，夫妻重新團聚。</p>
<p>這是一件最近的實事，美國的合衆社曾有專電報道這件新聞。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Army Actively Attacks in Jinxi, Recapturing Important Strongholds as Bandits Flee Xingcheng; Southern Liaoning Entirely Under National Army Control <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] Du Yuming has been directing operations on the front lines for days. It is reported that, in addition to his role as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Du has also been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region Bandit Suppression Headquarters, succeeding Fan Hanjie. Currently, Du and Wei Lihuang are seated together, constantly listening to reports and issuing orders.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huludao, 22nd] Bandit troops between Tashan and Gaoqiao are retreating eastward. The National Army has captured several of their soldiers. The Liao Corps is approaching Jinxi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] To seize the initiative, the National Army in Jinxi launched an attack on the 20th, swiftly recovering Shuangyubao, located ten li south of Yinan. On the 21st, they further recovered Hanjia Gou, twelve kilometers away. Bandit independent divisions such as the Independent Sixth and Independent Eighth fled towards Xingcheng from the aforementioned areas, pursued by the National Army. The bandits at Tashan, under heavy attack by the National Army, feel greatly threatened and are hastily constructing fortifications. Due to heavy casualties, they are busy replenishing their forces. Small skirmishes continue to occur in nearby areas, and the National Army is also making deployments. The bandits east of the Daling River are feeling the threat from the westward advance of the Shenyang corps. There are signs that Lin Biao and his command are moving from Beizhen to another location. Furthermore, the bandit Tenth Column is rushing from the area south of Xinlitun towards Beizhen, hoping to strengthen Beizhen's defenses.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] The bandit Eighth Column in the Northeast appears to be lying in wait in Jinzhou. The Second Column is in Goubangzi, the First Column is in Heishan Dahushan, the Fifth and Sixth Columns are in the Fuxin area, the Tenth Column is southwest of Xinlitun, and the Twelfth Column is in Kaiyuan. In total, the bandits have twelve field columns in the Northeast, and almost all have now been deployed south of the Liao River to the western Liaoning area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] Our crack troops advancing from Xinlitun decisively routed the bandit Tenth Column of Maoshan Ju on the 20th, killing and wounding over 700 bandits. The remaining bandits fled towards Beizhen, and the National Army immediately recovered Maoshan Town, and is currently pressing towards Beizhen and Heishan. Our other army, advancing westward from Yujiangtun (between Xinlitun and Zhangwu), approached Jiuhuan Chi (northeast of Fuxin) yesterday. The bandit Fifth Column stationed there was forced to retreat towards Fuxin, and the National Army is advancing towards Jiuhuan Chi and the Fuxin line.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] There is a possibility that the entirety of southern Liaoning will come under National Army control. Currently, military operations are proceeding according to plan. The Shuifeng hydroelectric plant on the Yalu River, which connects lines to Anshan, Yingkou, Dahushan, Goubangzi, Fuxin, and other places, had been providing power regularly after the communist bandits occupied Anshan. During their recent rout, they did not destroy the plant beforehand. It was reconnected to Shenyang at noon on the 10th, transmitting 10,000 kilowatts daily. However, on the night of the 20th, the bandits suddenly cut the power, depriving Shenyang of a source of electricity. Anshan and the bandit-controlled areas are now without light. The bandits may have anticipated that they would not be able to hold Yingkou, Dahushan, and Fuxin for long.</p>

Although our defending troops have suffered many casualties, their morale remains high.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] National Army inspectors who went to Changchun, Du Keting and Xiao Shuyao, recently reported on the battle situation in Changchun, stating, "Although the isolated troops are fighting hard, with no means to bury the dead or treat the wounded, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zheng is upholding the spirit of Whampoa, striving for justice for the country, fulfilling his great duty to the nation, and persisting to the end."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 22nd] Qualified individuals here point out that the bandits attacking Sui are still scattered in various locations in small groups, avoiding contact with the main force of the National Army. Their intention seems to be to spread their poison in the vast countryside. However, the people are already familiar with the bandits' usual cruel and deceptive tactics.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Military news: The National Army in Suiyuan has voluntarily withdrawn from Sate County (east of Baotou). Bandits occupied it at 12:00 last night. The bandit army appears to be attempting to attack Baotou.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Proposal to Announce Soviet Breach of Contract Facts; Heated Debate in Legislative Yuan; Vote Result is to First Question the Executive Yuan <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The 13th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 22nd, chaired by Chen Lifu. The meeting began at 9:30 AM. After listening to two reports, the discussion of the "Organizational Regulations of the Legislative Yuan's Disciplinary Committee" began. After discussing the draft prepared by the Legislative Committee article by article, without any amendments, it was passed. Subsequently, the report by the Foreign Affairs Committee on the review of Pan Chaoying's and others' proposal requesting the government to announce the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in order to correct international public opinion and clarify right and wrong sparked heated debate. Mr. Pan's original proposal listed evidence of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-American Treaty, believing that the current severe military, political, and economic situation in our country was largely caused by the conspiracy of international communists. Diplomatic measures were weak, unable to correct international public opinion and inspire national morale. He advocated requesting the government to announce all facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, lodging a serious protest with the Soviet Union, and if it was still ineffective, filing a complaint with the United Nations. During the Foreign Affairs Committee's review, Deputy Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao and Deputy Director of the National Government Ye Nan were invited to attend and report, as well as answer inquiries. After repeated detailed discussions, it was decided to report to the Yuan and first question the government. However, Mr. Pan and some other proposing members still declared their opposition, reserving the right to speak at the general meeting. Therefore, after the Foreign Affairs Committee's report was read by the secretariat and explained by the convener Zhang Daohang, Qi Zhihou and Pan Chaoying immediately raised objections, advocating for the original proposal to be passed. Mr. Pan pointed out that the government's provincial governors had repeatedly publicly admitted that the Soviet Union had indeed violated the Sino-Soviet Treaty, such as providing limited assistance to the communist bandits, hindering the takeover of Dalian, sending aircraft to participate in the Beitashan battle, and looting Northeast factories and allowing the Red Army to burn, kill, rape, and plunder in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia. Foreign Affairs officials also answered inquiries in the Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that the facts of the Soviet Union's breach of contract could not be officially announced until the situation was completely desperate. The current international and domestic situations are extremely serious, and it is time to resolutely announce these facts. He also said that if it is believed that announcing the Soviet Union's breach of contract will trigger a Sino-Soviet war, it is a groundless fear. However, Zhang Qingzhen immediately expressed opposition, believing that the facts of the Soviet Union's breach of contract have long been known to all, and there is no need to formally announce them again. As for the two steps of lodging a serious protest with the Soviet Union and filing a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly after the announcement, considering the country's strength and the world situation, it is feared that it will also be useless. Even questioning is not appropriate, as the government's unavoidable difficulties in dealing with Soviet diplomacy are well understood by everyone, and there is no need for the Legislative Yuan to question and propose explanations. Therefore, he advocated that the case be reserved. Cui Shuqin supported the Foreign Affairs Committee's review report. He emphasized that announcing the Soviet Union's breach of contract is an important diplomatic step, and there should be strong and effective action preparations afterward. Although a third world war may not be avoidable, we must not rashly take war as a way out, let alone be sacrificed first. Therefore, the consideration of diplomatic actions should be extremely cautious. As for the strength of the United Nations, before the veto issue is resolved, it is difficult to expect effective results after this issue is raised. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM. Chen Ruxuan again supported the passage of the original proposal. She recalled that when the Legislative Yuan agreed to ratify the Sino-Soviet Treaty two and a half years ago, it believed that although the treaty was humiliating, it could bring 30 years of peace and stability, so it reluctantly approved it. Who would have thought that even this equal treaty could not be truly fulfilled by the Soviet Union? Today, the high arrogance of the communist bandits and the deterioration of the domestic situation are all caused by the Soviet Union. She accused diplomacy of being weak and lacking policy, advocating for the government to announce the facts of the Soviet Union's breach of contract according to the original proposal, and file a complaint with the United Nations, so that the people can understand the government's difficulties and the true background of the communist bandit rebellion, and the world can also understand the Soviet Union's ambitions. Zhang Qianhua called for dealing with this matter rationally and considering what consequences would arise from this showdown behavior, advocating that the entire case be reserved. In total, about ten people spoke and submitted written opinions in the morning and afternoon. Finally, Yu Zheng and others' motion to stop the discussion was established. As a result of the vote, out of 262 attending members, 201 supported the review report, and it was decided to present a question to the Executive Yuan. The text of the case: "Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the treaty have emerged endlessly. After three years, it has not only caused serious domestic disputes, but also constitutes an international crisis and affects world peace. Has the government prepared any measures to maintain the dignity of the treaty and ensure national sovereignty? We hereby raise this question." At 5:00 PM, the discussion of the National Defense Committee's report on convening an enlarged meeting to review and investigate the responsibility for the loss of the Jinan battle began. Due to the matter involving military secrets, the meeting was changed to a closed meeting with the consent of the attendees. According to the Legislative Yuan Newsroom, the case was passed according to the review opinions and changed to a question. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Agencies' Policy Plans for Next Year Should Strive for Simplification; Executive Yuan Orders Compliance with Relevant Matters <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Regarding the formulation of policy plans and the assessment of work for the 38th year of the Republic by agencies subordinate to the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan has recently stipulated several matters that should be noted and ordered all agencies to comply. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Planning Aspects: (1) Policy plans (including administrative, operational, and business aspects) should strive for simplification, focusing on numbers. Regular administrative work does not need to be included. Agencies can decide whether to list items separately or use concise tables. (2) The plans of each agency, together with the preliminary estimates, will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then forwarded to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to compile the general budget proposal and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for approval. Each agency will then prepare a policy plan table and a monthly or quarterly schedule based on the budget as a basis for implementation and for the Executive Yuan to use for assessment.</p>
<p>B. Assessment Aspects: (1) Written reports are divided into two types: periodic and ad hoc. The monthly progress of important tasks and reviews, as well as the difficulties encountered in promoting work and the reasons for not being able to proceed according to the planned schedule, should be noted in the report and in the remarks column. Site inspections, supervision, rewards, and punishments should also be noted during the assessment.</p>
<p>C. Retention or Abolition of the Design Assessment Committee: Whether or not to establish an assessment committee in each agency is to be decided by each agency itself. However, if established, the principle is still to not increase personnel or expenses.</p>
<p>D. Planning, Formulation and Assessment during the Period of Not Yet Electing Provincial Governments: During the period when provincial and municipal governments have not yet been elected, the formulation and assessment of their plans shall still be handled in accordance with the procedures for central second-level agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Striving for the Initiative on the Central China Battlefield; National Army Holds the Handle of Victory; Xu Zuyi Reports on the Battle Situation to Reporters <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] General Xu Zuyi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Central China, hosted reporters in the afternoon of the 22nd and reported on the battle situation in Central China. With an excited tone, he pointed out that the military situation for suppressing the rebellion in Central China has now broken through the past situation and has definitely gained the initiative. The great battle brewing in southern Henan and northern Hubei and the bandits' attempt to provide reinforcements have been completely grasped by the White General Commander-in-Chief's brilliant plan. Xu analyzed the bandit's situation and said: Since mid-September, Liu Fei has mobilized its 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 10th, and 12th columns, totaling eight columns, and gathered in the northeastern area of Nanyang, preparing to besiege Nanyang and destroy the railway along the line from Xinyang to Queshan, in order to coordinate with Chen Fei's offensive in Shandong. Seeing that our deployment was comprehensive and fearing annihilation, he fled back to Yuxian in early October, with the 1st, 3rd, and 4th columns occupying Wuchang, Fangcheng and Nanzhao, and the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 12th columns fleeing south to Pingshi (south of Biyang) and Huyang, in an attempt to avoid a decisive battle and defend by attacking. On the 15th of this month, with the 2nd and 6th columns fleeing south to the northwest of Ying Shanxi, our army had already prepared. We launched a fierce counterattack immediately. The bandit army suffered heavy losses and had to retreat westward on the 17th. At the moment, the bandits 2nd and 6th columns are fleeing to Maozifan (west of Suixian), and the 10th and 12th columns are fleeing to the area north of Zaoyang, and we are encircling and suppressing them. Talking about the battle results of the past half month, Xu said: (1) There are no large bandit troops in the Jianghan area and the Dabie Mountain area; (2) After the National Army occupied Biyang, the main force of Liu Fei was forced to flee north and south.

<h3 id="e25">Seeing the Crisis in Asia from South Korea <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In South Korea, more than 3,000 policemen in Yeosu suddenly launched a mutiny on the 20th, and with lightning speed, occupied the two cities of Yeosu and Suncheon in one fell swoop, and called on all the Korean people to overthrow the newly established Korean government. At that time, Seoul immediately declared martial law to prevent the fifth column from taking the opportunity to act. Defense Minister Lee Beom-seok immediately dispatched two brigades of regular troops from Jeonju to suppress the rebellion. They immediately defeated this group of motley rebel forces led by the communists, and withdrew south toward Gurye, fleeing into the mountains. Looking at the general trend, the South Korean government is able to control the overall situation, and there should be no problem; however, the mutiny that occurred in South Korea this time happened just when the Soviet troops in North Korea began to withdraw, and it is definitely not comparable to ordinary events. Moreover, whether these motley rebel forces will disappear from now on after fleeing into the mountains, and no longer be a future problem for South Korea, is also a serious problem. At least at this time, when the current situation has not been completely clarified, we cannot make rash judgments.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, "Some parties do not believe that this mutiny in South Korea is related to the withdrawal of Soviet troops in North Korea, nor do they believe that it is related to the communist activities in South Korea. These motley rebel forces do not seem to be communist elements in South Korea. There was no plan beforehand, and after occupying the two cities of Yeosu and Suncheon, they did not consolidate their positions, and then withdrew southward." Judging from this, the mutiny of the Yeosu police in South Korea does not seem to be the rebellion of the South Korean communists, but a political demonstration. But from our third-party point of view, the inside story of the mutiny in South Korea will never be so simple, and its meaning should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Although the United States is very cautious about this mutiny because the U.S. military is not involved in the vortex, the State Department and the Army Department are closely watching the development of the South Korean situation, and believe that if the South Korean situation deteriorates, the U.S. military commander stationed in South Korea can immediately take action. Only from this point of view, the mutiny in South Korea may not only expand into a civil war in Korea, but also, if not careful, may evolve into a full-scale war in Asia. We do not want to be alarmist, but we cannot help but point out the facts we have recently seen in Northeast Asia in order to arouse the vigilance of all countries related to the Far East about the crisis in Asia.</p>
<p>First, the new South Korean government was established not long ago, and North Korea quickly caught up and also organized a North Korean government, and immediately obtained Soviet recognition, and sent Steikov as a special ambassador, who will further conclude a military alliance as an aid to North Korea's resistance against South Korea. In the event of a military conflict between North Korea and South Korea in the future, the Soviet Union can provide military assistance in the name of an allied country. In addition, the Soviet Union has also adopted an offensive in diplomacy, first announcing that the Soviet troops have withdrawn from North Korea, forcing the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to withdraw to their country. In this way, the entire Korea may fall under Soviet control! The Soviet Union has long harbored ulterior motives for South Korea. Communist cells are lurking in the police or army in South Korea. This time, the Yeosu police mutiny was expected by those who are familiar with the internal situation of Korea.</p>
<p>Second, the current focus of Britain and the United States is on Europe. Because of the Berlin blockade, they are trying to use the United Nations Security Council to condemn the Soviet Union's blockade behavior as a threat to world peace, and attempt to have a showdown with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union took the opportunity of Britain and the United States neglecting Asia and launched an offensive in Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia to coordinate with the communist bandits' rebellion in China. The activity of communist forces in Southeast Asian countries has already been discussed in the editorial of this newspaper; now, a mutiny has suddenly occurred in South Korea, and its meaning is exactly the same, that is, the Soviet Union wants to control the entire Asia behind the scenes. Therefore, the mutiny in South Korea this time is an alarm for Asia, giving a head-on blow to Britain and the United States who only know that the communist forces are gradually advancing to Western Europe and ignoring the Asian crisis. The German anti-communist leader regarded the South Korean mutiny as a warning to Germany, and believed that Germany may become Korea today in the future, which contains infinite truth and insight.</p>
<p>Third, the Comintern in Northeast Asia has already been organized and established in Outer Mongolia. The only task of the Comintern is to form a "pro-Soviet buffer zone" composed of Korea, Mongolia, and the Northeast of our country. This work is currently being actively carried out. The mutiny in South Korea this time is echoing each other with the communist bandits in the Northeast launching an offensive against Changchun and Jinzhou, which is a step in their execution of this task. We must not take it lightly and only regard it as an internal political struggle in Korea.</p>
<p>In short, since the communist forces have invaded Southeast Asian countries, and are now launching an offensive in Northeast Asia, coupled with the expansion of the communist bandits' rebellion in China, it fully demonstrates the depth and seriousness of the crisis in Asia. For the sake of their own survival, Asian countries should become aware of this as soon as possible, unite together, and quickly formulate a major plan for self-defense and regeneration. Even countries related to Asia, especially Britain and the United States, even if not for the sake of Asian peace, but for their own interests, should take a broad and long-term view, re-examine their foreign policy, and make plans to "mend the fold after the sheep is lost" as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Wuxi [This Newspaper, 22nd] The phenomenon of competing to purchase goods is prevalent throughout the city. Now, people are rushing to buy lumber, paint, porcelain, sweets, and tea. Restaurants have stopped business due to lack of rice. Snack noodle shops have stopped night markets, and there are rumors of bathhouses closing down.

<p>Suzhou [This Newspaper, 22nd] The local flour association was ordered by the authorities to prepare for the universal distribution of flour. The meeting recently decided to sell at 30 locations, with each person purchasing 5 jin every five days with their national identity card.

Fortunately, the security authorities were well-prepared and made every effort to maintain order, and the situation did not escalate.</p>
<p>Yangzhou [This Newspaper, 22nd] The authorities in this county, in order to eliminate the black market and strictly prohibit搶購, decided to implement a voucher distribution system, first implementing it for rice, oil, sugar, cloth, kerosene, flour, soap, and matches, which are daily necessities.

<p>Jiangyin [This Newspaper, 22nd] Cheng District is short of rice. Grain merchants purchased more than 1,000 shi of indica rice from Anhui Province and will distribute it at eight locations inside and outside the city starting today to temporarily maintain the people's food supply.</p>

In addition, the Ministry of Food plans to purchase 1.33 million shi at market prices, resulting in local grain prices exceeding the limited price by a considerable amount. The people of Wuhu are limited to buying 2 sheng of rice per day. It is reported that Wuhu rice mills have a stock of approximately 100,000 shi of grain. If it is shipped externally, it can supply the people's food for three months.</p>
<p>Mingguang [This Newspaper, 22nd] Since the Mingguang branch of the Bank of China began using Gold Yuan Certificates to exchange for legal tender, the amount collected has been very large.

<p>Hefei [This Newspaper, 22nd] Hefei is experiencing a severe shortage of materials. Important items such as rice, straw, oil, and salt are available at a price but not for sale. Fried dough sticks and sesame cakes have automatically doubled in price.

According to Director Fan, straw, rice, oil, and salt will be made available in the market within a few days.</p>
<p>Nanchang [This Newspaper, 22nd] Various goods on the market are being搶購, almost emptying the city. Coffins are also being hoarded from today.

<p>Guangzhou [This Newspaper, 22nd] The Guangzhou economic management authorities will implement the public price distribution of sugar and cooking oil starting on November 1st. Citizens will purchase with vouchers according to the grain distribution method.</p>

The market situation is chaotic, and the common people are complaining. The authorities seem unable to control it.</p>
<p>Chengdu [This Newspaper, 22nd] The Chengdu Police Department continued to investigate hoarding. On the 22nd, they discovered that Yonghua Company and Zhenghe Woolen Goods Store were hoarding a large amount of woolen cloth and sealed them for investigation.</p>
<p>Chongqing [This Newspaper, 22nd] The Pacification Headquarters has now approved the negotiated prices for public buses: 14 cents per section in the urban area and 5 cents per kilometer in the suburbs. In addition, a frugal Chinese meal costs 8 yuan per table, and a Western meal costs 1.2 yuan per person.</p>
<p>Guilin [This Newspaper, 22nd] A rush to purchase suddenly arose in the quiet rice market. Rice coming from the four rural areas to the city was bought by unscrupulous merchants at the asking price as soon as it was offered, and the price of rice rose by half out of thin air. The inspection team went out to stop it to no avail, and the people were panicked.</p>
<p>Xi'an [This Newspaper, 22nd] Some goods that have been absent from the market for a long time have reappeared in recent days. The cigarette and gauze markets have returned to their previous rampant state, with prices three to seven times higher than before. Hairdressing, bathing, and hotels have increased prices following the film and theater industries. However, department stores are still acting coldly, and street vendors' transactions are becoming more active.</p>

It is reported that the ministry has forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

Brahma-Gria said that the neutral countries had always carried out mediation work with perseverance and had created an atmosphere of harmony. He urged all member states to be frank and cooperate, and said, "What we seek is a simple, clear and practical solution. If this solution can be achieved, it will breed the hope of peace. The intention of the compromise plan is a clear and practical solution, to ease the agitated and tense emotions, and to avoid resolutions that could cause war."

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 22nd broadcast: The six neutral countries of the Security Council formally continued to ask the four powers to end the Berlin blockade crisis and proposed a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four powers around the end of November to discuss the German question. After Vyshinsky requested at the last minute that the Security Council extend the vote on the Berlin issue to next Monday, the compromise plan for the Berlin dispute, which had been eagerly awaited, was finally submitted to the Security Council. Acting Chairman Brahma-Gria said that the compromise plan was intended to avoid resolutions that could cause war. Western representatives held off-site discussions on Vyshinsky's last request, which delayed the start of the meeting by one hour. It is reported that the Western representatives decided to give the Soviet Union extra time. The agenda was slightly changed due to Vyshinsky's temporary motion, that is, the compromise plan was put forward, and after listening to the speeches of the representatives, the vote was postponed to next Monday.</p>

<p>[United States News, Paris, 21st] The United Nations Acting Mediator for Palestine, Bunche, stipulated tonight that noon on the 22nd (Greenwich Mean Time) is the deadline for the ceasefire between the Israeli and Egyptian armies fighting in the Negev desert in southern Palestine. Bunche notified the United Nations representatives in Tel Aviv and Cairo of the ceasefire deadline, and at the same time forwarded them to the Israeli and Egyptian governments respectively.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 22nd] According to official announcements, the Israeli government has sent the order to "implement the ceasefire" to the military chiefs in the Negev region, and the ceasefire order will take effect at 3 pm (local time). Egypt has also formally accepted the Security Council's ceasefire order.

Israeli troops have occupied positions between Magida and Gaza, and it is reported that Jewish troops south of Gaza have been able to control the southern highway.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tel Aviv, 22nd] The United Nations monitoring group has left here for the Negev to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire order.

<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 21st] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall met with Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris this morning. It is believed that Tsaldaris's visit is quite important because Marshall has just returned from a 48-hour stay in Greece. It is rumored that Tsaldaris will ask the Political Committee to discuss the Balkan issue before the Palestine issue. Now, because the United States is unwilling to see the Political Committee discuss the previous issue before the presidential election, Tsaldaris's application may receive American assistance.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] General Clay gave a speech at the Smith Foundation here tonight, saying that the Soviet Union deliberately chose Berlin as a place to try to obstruct the political and economic recovery of free European countries. However, Soviet planners failed to recognize the strength of our air force, and they did not understand the determination of the Western allies to fulfill their responsibilities. With political and economic stability, the people of free European countries with self-esteem have the ability to safeguard their freedom, and they cherish this freedom. At that time, no government can force the European people to accept its will, and a minority of people who rely on external forces to seize power by means of coercion will also be replaced by governments elected by the people and responsible to the people. Before stability is ensured, we must persist in our determination to maintain peace, otherwise others will use aggressive acts to deal with defenseless people and lead to the destruction of peace. Maintaining peace means avoiding war.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] American Military Governor of Germany Clay told a press conference here today that the Soviets in Germany are organizing a police force of 200,000 to 300,000 people. He believes that this police force is a potential military organization. Clay said that although there is no obvious concentration of troops in East Germany, the police force is expanding every day. He told reporters that, as far as he knows, there is no preparation or movement in the Soviet occupation zone to indicate that the Soviet Union is preparing for war. After holding the press conference, Clay went to the White House to report to President Truman on the Berlin situation. This afternoon he met with the National Security Council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] President Truman recently approved General Clay's request for additional aircraft to strengthen the Berlin airlift on the eve of the six member states of the Security Council putting forward another compromise plan for the Berlin issue.

<h3 id="e52">Berlin Municipal Government Splits <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] Western Allied officials predicted on the 22nd that even if the Soviet Union lifts the blockade, the split of the Berlin municipal government will continue unchanged. Since the beginning of the blockade, the Soviet Union has been taking steps to split the city into eastern and western parts. Allied officials believe that there is little hope of reversing the situation. Even if more extensive problems can be solved, there will be many difficulties in restoring the political situation in Berlin as it was. Today's Berlin has two police systems, two major trade unions, and two currencies. Communist mobs forced the municipal council to withdraw from the city hall located in the Soviet zone and move to the British zone, and the Soviet Union declared all actions after the relocation illegal. It is expected that the final split will occur during the city elections held according to the Western plan on December 5. The Soviet Union does not allow elections to be held in its zone, and even if a new municipal government is established, eastern Berlin will definitely not recognize it. Berlin communists have learned the techniques of the Soviet occupation zone and are also preparing a "people's government," just waiting to take the stage.</p>

The General Assembly advocated electing Greek representative Spiropoulos, while the Security Council advocated electing Indian representative Rau.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 22nd] Yeosu, where 2,500 security forces launched a mutiny, was recaptured by government troops at 2 AM this morning. Therefore, the date for the resolution of the South Korean rebellion should be earlier than expected. Syngman Rhee told reporters this morning: The situation in Yeosu is safe and sound, and the restoration of security in other areas is only a matter of days. A Korean government spokesman confirmed today that senior government military officers, including Commander-in-Chief Song Hu, had flown south from Seoul on nine transport aircraft to command the operation. The naval defense forces are now guarding the sea off Yeosu to prevent the rebels from escaping by sea. It is also heard that rebellions have also occurred in other places, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd] The local armed anti-government disturbances that occurred on the Yeosu Peninsula in southernmost Korea the day before yesterday have now been suppressed by government forces.

The South Korean Ministry of National Defense issued Public Announcement No. 1 at 2 pm on the 22nd: "On the 20th of this month, the 14th Regiment stationed in Yeosu launched a mutiny. The Masan troops stationed in Gwangju have now been ordered to rush to Yeosu to suppress the unrest. The Jiri Mountains have been surrounded by a commando team. The rebellion can be quelled. We hope that the people will stay at their posts." According to the ministry, the mutiny was instigated by the North Korean People's Republic, which can be proved by the fact that they raised the Korean flag during the operation. The reason for launching the operation at this time may be to commemorate the Soviet "October Revolution."</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Korean Minister of Home Affairs Yoon Chi-young predicted on the 21st that the Communist-launched attempt to overthrow the government could be "defeated" in four or five days.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] According to reliable sources close to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, at least three judges in the International Military Tribunal made it clear that their attitudes were contrary to the opinions of the entire tribunal, and they may not agree with the final judgment currently being prepared by the majority of the judges. But he also pointed out that the contrary opinions of a very small number of judges based on English, American and French law are not enough to diminish the power and effect of the judgment of the majority of judges. The judgment of the majority of judges on the 25 Japanese war criminals will still be the legal final conviction. The person also said that the final verdict has not yet been completed, so the military tribunal cannot open on November 1 as announced by the Secretary General of the tribunal yesterday, and the date of the tribunal's reopening is likely to be in mid-November.</p>
<p>He also told reporters that the completed final verdict will be a document exceeding 3,000 pages. Among them, 1,300 pages are the verdict drafted by the majority of the judges, and 400 pages are appendices. Another 1,300 pages are the statements of the judges with dissenting opinions, but only the legal final verdict of the majority of the judges on the Japanese Class A war suspects will be read in the court, and the rest will be filed again and will not be read publicly. It will take eight or nine days to read the verdict before announcing the sentences of the defendants.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] The Supervisor's Office announced last night: For the goods that the city's industry and commerce registered with the Social Affairs Bureau for the first time, if necessary, the government can purchase the raw materials and daily necessities and distribute them to factories and citizens at a limited price. At the same time, all manufacturers and wholesalers must register their inventory of finished products with the Social Affairs Bureau and must not hide them. These inventories include wool fabrics, cotton fabrics, knitted fabrics, soap, cigarettes, rubber products, etc. The Social Affairs Bureau will issue a formal notice today, and registration will begin before the 27th. Those who hide them will be confiscated. The Supervisor's Office has also sent a letter to the municipal government, asking it to check underground warehouses during the general household registration check.</p>
<p>It is reported that the reason why the responsible authorities have taken the above-mentioned strict measures is because they firmly believe that there is no shortage of materials in Shanghai, but most of them are hidden by merchants, waiting for prices to rise. The Shanghai Economic Control Supervisor's Office also sent a letter to the municipal government asking it to instruct manufacturers to supply goods. The original letter stated: The purpose of the general registration of the city's main daily necessities is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding goods and to understand the inventory of manufacturers. In the past ten days, a few merchants have believed that the goods that have been registered have been registered and obtained the government's recognition, so they can wait and see, and are unwilling to sell them on the market, which is a great loss of the meaning of the general registration. We should send a letter to you to check and instruct all manufacturers to supply the market as much as possible with the goods that have been registered to maintain the normal operation of the market. The municipal government has recently instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct all industries to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Manager of Dade Qianzhuang Sentenced for Falsely Establishing Deposit Accounts <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Wang Yuting, the manager of Dade Qianzhuang in this city, falsely established a type A current deposit account for Hengli Household starting in 1947, and falsely filled in the address of the account's seal piece as No. 6 Tongji Lane, Tianjin Road, in order to avoid the attention of the financial authorities. When the principal and interest of Qingfeng and other two households of the zhuang's current loans were due, they were paid by transferring funds from the Hengli Household's check, or transferred to the accounts of the zhuang's customers, the Xinyi Weaving Factory and the Renhe Company, in order to conceal the asset and liability situation. All the checks were personally issued by Wang Yuting, including check number A〇〇461, with an amount of 80 million yuan, and check number A〇〇446, with an amount of 500 million yuan. On June 3 of this year, after being discovered by the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for prosecution. Judge Wu Xiangzu concluded the trial yesterday and sentenced Wang Yuting to seven months of imprisonment for deliberately making false records in the accounts.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Prosecuted for Hoarding Yarn, Cloth, Soap, and Candles <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Procuratorate recently prosecuted three cases of hoarding for speculation: (1) Rong Bingsheng, the warehouse director of Shenxin No. 2 Factory, along with factory director Wang Yinzhan and personnel section chief Li Yaoting, jointly purchased twenty-one bales of Jin Shuang Ma brand cotton yarn in March of this year. They stored them in the factory's No. 5 warehouse and did not offer them for sale on the market. When the currency reform took place in August and the government strictly enforced economic controls, the city implemented warehouse inspections. The defendants disobeyed the order to report and register the yarn, and instead transferred it to the No. 4 warehouse. They covered it with hemp sacks and waste cotton in an attempt to evade inspection. On the afternoon of September 27th, Rong Bingsheng ordered workers to take out the stored yarn, intending to load it onto a ship for external transport. This was met with dissatisfaction by worker Chen Dahong, who secretly reported it to the Putuo Police Sub-bureau, which then investigated and uncovered the case.</p>
<p>(2) Gu Weiliang from Haimen and Li Biaoyuan from Guangdong are both without legitimate occupations. On the morning of the 7th of this month, they came to Shanghai from Nanxiang. They acquired sixteen bolts of striped bedding cloth and fourteen bolts of printed cloth in the Wuma Road area. They divided the cloth between two bicycles and transported it back to Nanxiang for hoarding. In order to evade inspection, they took small roads, passing through Nan Lu and Taopu Road. As a result, they were apprehended by plainclothes police officers.</p>
<p>(3) Cao Youtang from Cixi hoarded thirty-one boxes of soap, four boxes of foreign candles, six cans of vegetable oil, and two jars of spirits for more than four years without offering them for sale. The Huangpu Police Sub-bureau discovered the hoard.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Pigs Destined for Shanghai Detained in Yangzhou: Merchants Request Authorities to Intervene for Release <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pig Industry Association recently purchased 1,200 pigs in Jiangbei, but when they were being transported through Yangzhou, the Yangzhou County Government detained all of them and prevented them from being shipped to Shanghai. After sending representatives for negotiations, 224 pigs were forcibly seized. The association then entrusted the Zhenjiang Pig Industry Association to repeatedly negotiate for their release, but to no avail. Yesterday, the association specially sent representatives to the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade to request assistance. It is reported that the brigade has forwarded an urgent telegram to the Yangzhou County Government through the Supervisor's Office, requesting the release of all the pigs.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Real Estate Transactions Stalled, Building Materials Difficult to Purchase, Affecting Housing Construction Movement <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Real estate transactions in this city have noticeably entered a standstill in recent weeks. While asking prices continue to rise, transactions have slowed down. This is because building materials are difficult to buy, making housing construction extremely difficult, thus weakening the demand for vacant land. Generally, sellers, amidst a strong buying frenzy, continue to raise prices. For example, vacant land on Yuyuan Road near Jiangsu Road is being priced as high as 150,000 yuan per mu, but there is a lack of buyers, resulting in a de facto stalemate. It is reported that those with idle funds are increasingly turning to alleyway properties that are already occupied, as prices are relatively lower. For example, a recent transaction for alleyway properties opposite the Hankou Road Securities Building was only 220,000 yuan per mu (including the buildings on the land). It is estimated that if the land were vacant, it would be worth 450,000 yuan per mu.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that due to the strict price controls recently implemented in the city, the supply of building materials such as cement, bricks, tiles, yellow sand, and gravel has also become scarce, which is affecting housing construction in the city. It is reported that the Shanghai Real Estate Association is encouraging its members to continue building new houses in support of the authorities' "Ten Thousand Houses" movement. The first batch of new housing construction organized collectively by the members has already designated a site on Dunxin Road, where it is planned to build thirty-three detached houses, each forty feet deep, and either fourteen feet or eighteen feet wide. The materials for this batch of houses have mostly been secured, and it is expected that all will be completed by December of next year. In addition, members of the association are also building new residential houses separately, with one project on Daxilu consisting of twelve detached houses, and another at 76 Jessfield Road, planning to build over one hundred detached houses. The materials for the former project have mostly been secured, while the latter is still in the planning stage.</p>

<p>The fish shortage in this city is becoming increasingly serious. The Supervisor's Office and the Police Bureau have convened three meetings with the fishing industry in recent days and are now carefully studying how to remedy the situation. According to the fishing industry, the reasons for the fish shortage are as follows: (1) Half of the fishing boats have stopped working due to a shortage of rice and reduced allocations of diesel fuel. (2) Many freshwater fish being transported to Shanghai are intercepted en route, and those that do arrive are mostly flowing into the newly emerging black markets in Nanxiang, Fangjia Yao, and Caojiadu, evading regulations. (3) The export of salted and dried fish is prohibited in the production areas. (4) In the past, over twenty pairs of fishing boats from North China regularly supplied Shanghai, but they have now disappeared because it is no longer profitable. The fishing industry urgently hopes that the authorities will quickly resolve the above-mentioned difficulties.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Because wool, cotton cloth, and silk clothing materials are difficult to buy and subject to purchase restrictions, panic buying has spread to clothing stores on Shilu Road. The Clothing Industry Association submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau appealing to it, stating that the source of clothing for the industry is from goods that have reached the end of their term at pawnshops. Currently, pawnshop business is far from what it used to be, the source of supply has decreased, and it is impossible to purchase new clothing materials. They requested restrictions on customer purchases. The Social Affairs Bureau has approved limiting each person to purchasing one long garment or one short suit based on a certificate.</p>

Due to the suspicion of evading foreign export restrictions on gold, the economic police detained the two and took them back to the brigade headquarters for interrogation. The man identified himself as Xue Bin, 40 years old, from Jiangyin, residing at 836 Julu Road in this city. The woman was his wife, named Wang Qinghua. Regarding the gold, they claimed it was inherited from their ancestors and said they were planning a suburban outing. However, when questioned why they were carrying a large amount of gold during the outing and why they had not exchanged it at the Central Bank, they were evasive. In addition to continuing the investigation, the two were temporarily released on bail yesterday. The seized gold has been sent by the police to the National Bank for exchange.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Case of Murder at Xuhui Public School Solved: Janitor Loyal to His Duties, Hated and Killed by Thieves: Three Perpetrators Arrested and Confess <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Fei Wenquan, the janitor of Xuhui Public School in Xujiahui, Husi, was on duty at approximately 1:30 AM on the 15th when four thugs rushed in from the darkness. They took out ropes, tied up Fei, took a Boy Scout knife, and repeatedly slashed his neck and other parts, killing him on the spot, as detailed in this newspaper. Afterwards, the school authorities reported the situation to the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau. Zhang, the head of the bureau, ordered Yuan Jie, the chief of the criminal division, along with Patrolman Zhang Wenyuan, and officers Jiang Bin, Wang Jianping, and Wei Jintang, to rush to the scene at night to investigate the truth. They summoned other janitors, Huang Guangyuan and Ruan Youqing, for questioning. According to Ruan Youqing, a fireman named Xu Fengbiao had conspired with others on the night of September 21st to steal four shi of white rice from the school, which they put in sacks. Two shi had already been taken over the wall, and the remaining two shi were left inside the wall. Someone discovered them, and they immediately fled. The incident was reported to Yang, the director of general affairs, who reported it to the police bureau for investigation. In addition, water pens and clothing were frequently stolen from rooms B, C, and the self-study rooms, as well as the dean's office.</p>
<p>It was observed that this group of thieves was very familiar with the routes in the school, so it was determined that it was an inside job. After Fei Wenquan was killed, a white running shoe was found that the criminal had dropped while escaping over the wall. After examination, it was determined that this shoe may have been worn by Shen Hongdao, a worker who had been dismissed in mid-August. It was suspected that Fei's murder was committed by Xu and others. Based on the above points, police personnel began their investigation. They first summoned Zhu Liansheng, Xu Fengbiao's brother-in-law, for questioning to find out where Xu was. It was said that Xu was now a laborer in a certain warehouse, lived in Xiangqiao, Taicang, and had several relatives and friends in Shanghai. Chief Yuan obtained this clue and sent Patrolman Zhang to lead police officers Ling Xian and Chuan Peiying to Taicang, Xu's hometown, and Kunshan, his sister's home, to arrest him, but they found nothing. At the same time, more officers were dispatched to Shanghai to track him down, but there were no leads. Later, another secret report was received, stating that this group of criminals was hiding in the home of a fellow villager of Xu, surnamed Lu, who repaired foreign umbrellas for a living in Yangjialou, Hongqiao Road. The police officers were then dispatched to question Lu. They then found Xu's name on the worker roster at the Transportation Department of the Hongkou Materials Supply Bureau, knowing that he lived at 93 Zhangqiao Road, Qimei Road. At 2:00 AM on the 20th, officers were dispatched and沈鴻道(Shen Hongdao) was arrested. During interrogation, he confessed to helping kill Fei, and also said that Xu Fengbiao and others were hiding at Baziqiao, Shuidian Road, Zhabei. Police officers were dispatched again, but they had left four hours earlier. After further investigation, it was learned that Xu</p>
<p>was extremely cunning and had moved four times in five days. Until the afternoon of the 20th, police officers Jiang Bin and Wang Jianping, who were waiting in Taicang, reported by telephone that they had learned that Xu and others had left Shanghai and were hiding in the home of Tang Fugeng in Hengtang, Kunshan City. Patrolman Zhang was then dispatched alone to Kunshan, along with police officers Jiang and Wang, to rush to the Tang's home and arrest Xu Fengbiao and Cao Yongqing. Stolen goods such as water pens and绒线衫 (rongxian shan, wool sweaters) were seized. They were then escorted back to Shanghai that night and interrogated thoroughly. They all confessed without denial. Xu was the main culprit, using the military knife to commit the crime, Cao held the hemp rope, and Shen and two others who are still at large were the lookouts. As for Fei's murder, it was actually because he was loyal to his duties, which caused the thieves to hate him and commit this act.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Shanghai Municipal Government has drafted plans for conserving automobile gasoline in Shanghai. In addition to vehicles that will not be cut, three additional plans were proposed for those that cannot be cut and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is now known that the Executive Yuan's Steering Committee for Conservation has reviewed each of these plans. The first plan, which would reduce 6,500 vehicles, and the second plan, which would reduce 1,500 vehicles, were considered to have serious consequences as they would lead to driver unemployment and vehicle damage. However, if the third plan, which conserves gasoline without reducing the number of vehicles, were adopted, it would violate the emergency order for financial and economic emergencies and would inevitably lead to a black market for gasoline. It was then decided to hand it over to representatives of the Ministry of Transportation and other relevant agencies to resubmit the study and then submit it to the Steering Committee for Conservation for decision.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Revision of House Tax and Construction Tax Rates: Director of the Bureau of Finance Explains the Truth <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Recently, citizens of this city received house tax payment notices from the Bureau of Finance, with the listed amounts increased by as much as five hundred times. Citizens are纷纷 inquiring with the Bureau of Finance about the truth. Tian Yongqian, Director of the Bureau of Finance, in order to clarify the truth for the citizens, stated to reporters yesterday: The current house tax directly uses the "total value of the house" (i.e., the total value of all houses) as the base for taxation, which is different from the previous base of "assessed rental value." In the past, during the concession era, the highest house tax rate, based on the assessed rental value, reached 30% (with an additional 50% surcharge), and the lowest was 13%. After the recovery of the city, the tax rate was 10% of the assessed rental value for commercial properties and 5% for residential properties. This revision changes the base to the assessed total value of the house, with a total tax rate of 1.4% (14 per thousand) for commercial properties (including both house tax and municipal construction tax) and 0.8% (8 per thousand) for residential properties, with each tax accounting for half. Therefore, the actual tax rate has been reduced. The reason this is easily misunderstood by citizens is that the house tax and municipal construction tax are collected together, and the notice only states the total amount without specifying the separate amounts. Regarding the tax rate, the resolution of the Municipal Council is that the house tax and municipal construction tax each account for half, so the burden is borne equally by the homeowner and the tenant, as stipulated. However, the house tax must be paid by the residents on behalf of the homeowner for the convenience of collection, and all of this is stipulated by the original central regulations and has not been changed. It is hoped that citizens will understand this clearly. Although the old assessed total value of houses in this city was determined through scientific and detailed procedures, omissions or discrepancies may be unavoidable. If such situations occur, it is hoped that citizens will apply to this bureau for reassessment and re-evaluation to ensure fairness. However, before the reassessment, it is hoped that all house tax and construction tax will be paid in advance. Director Tian also stated that it is estimated that there are over 200,000 households in the suburbs, rural areas, and urban areas of this city, and the collection of house tax and construction tax may amount to over 3 million gold yuan. However, whether the budgeted amount can be fully collected is difficult to predict at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Influx of Floating Capital into Guangzhou Creates a Tempestuous Situation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liang Feng</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] The golden autumn is originally the most lovely season in southern China. There is a saying in the business community here: "The fifth month is poor, the sixth is beautiful, and the seventh month brings a rebound," meaning that everything comes to life in the autumn. Unfortunately, this year, a storm in late autumn unexpectedly stirred up a tempest in the market. General prices have soared, rising three to four times compared to "August 19th." The speed of this price increase and the chaos in the market are unprecedented compared to previous inflationary periods before the currency reform. Ordinary citizens are naturally living in fear, and the authorities responsible for economic control are also finding it difficult to cope. The Special Price Review Committee has not held a meeting for one or two weeks, probably because the market is too chaotic and they cannot evaluate prices.</p>
<p>A Terrible Loophole</p>
<p>Originally, the general situation had been relatively stable for a month and a half after the currency reform, and the wave of panic buying had not yet reached Guangzhou. Chairman Song Ziwen had already considered the problem of floating capital flowing south. As early as September 7th, he announced measures to restrict remittances. However, there was still a loophole: after the currency reform, the Ministry of Finance revoked the previous restrictions on carrying national currency south. This made it difficult to restrict remittances, while the carrying of gold yuan was still free. As a result, the Guangzhou Management Office had to immediately telegraph the Ministry of Finance, urging the swift implementation of a restriction on passengers traveling south, limiting each person to carrying no more than one thousand gold yuan. However, official correspondence takes time. Before this measure was implemented, those perceptive merchants from Shanghai, Wuhan, Hunan, and Jiangxi took advantage of this opportunity, carrying large amounts of floating capital that could not find a way out, and flocked south along the Yuehan Railway. As a result, the high-end hotels here were completely full, and the restaurants and dance halls were crowded with these "outsider" big spenders. Some, with connections, smuggled this floating capital to Hong Kong. Those who could not, rushed to buy goods in Guangzhou. They did not care about prices at all, only seeking to grab goods, from many to few, from large to small, scavenging everywhere and even extending to the surrounding four rural counties. With such an influx of floating capital, how could the Guangzhou industry and commerce, which was already on the verge of suffocation, resist? As a result, general store owners, seeing these big spenders, desperately increased prices, and some even closed their doors to avoid customers. Some of this floating capital could not buy goods and instead started buying foreign currency, causing a sharp reaction in the market, and the black market for currency revived. The market began to stir up about two or three days before National Day, and in less than half a month, general black market prices had risen more than three times.</p>
<p>The Existence of Black Market Price Differences</p>
<p>Because there was a black market price difference between the gold yuan and the Hong Kong dollar, the cost of goods in general became increasingly divergent from the official prices set. Guangzhou is a consumer market, and all goods rely on the surrounding four rural counties for supply. The government's strict enforcement of price controls caused goods from the surrounding rural areas to be hesitant to arrive. Merchants, seeing the source of goods become scarce, were reluctant to release their stock. In addition, some unconscionable merchants took the opportunity to hoard goods and manipulate the market, resulting in a peculiar shortage of daily necessities. Except for rice, which was relatively stable, other items such as cooking oil, firewood, pork, lamb, fish, and vegetables were almost extinct in the market. As a result, housewives have been lamenting for days that there is no food to buy, leading the ignorant citizens to believe that the enemy's army is about to invade. People are agitated, and a general atmosphere of fear prevails, which has created a serious problem for the managing authorities.</p>
<p>Speculators Have Opportunities to Take Advantage</p>
<p>According to experts, this drastic fluctuation in finance and prices is due to: (1) the postponement of the exchange of foreign currency, giving financial speculators an opportunity; (2) the impact of the war; (3) rampant smuggling; (4) hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants; and (5) the failure of government price controls to coordinate with commodity regulation. Chairman Song further pointed out that the main reason for the rise in prices is that the exchange rate of the gold yuan is too different from the original black market rate of foreign currencies in Guangzhou, and the government stipulates that the prices of "August 19" should be the standard, so the rise in black market prices is "unavoidable."</p>
<p>The managing authorities have formulated or implemented the following measures to address the current poor situation. In terms of finance: (1) Vigorously curb the southward flow of floating capital; (2) Private radio stations and telecommunications disrupting finance and buying and selling foreign currency are all punishable by death; (3) Employees in the gold and silver industry are not allowed to hold foreign currency from October 15th; (4) Incoming merchants are strictly inspected at airports, ships, hotels, and trading houses, and any foreign currency found is exchanged for gold yuan. Anyone found with more than one thousand yuan will be detained. In terms of commodity prices: (1) Coordinate commodities in various regions; (2) Restrict the external transport of commodities; (3) Strengthen control of grain; (4) Distribute daily necessities in advance; (5) Register inventory and inspect warehouses; (6) Strictly crack down on unscrupulous merchants; (7) Order stores not to close without reason; (8) Strengthen anti-smuggling efforts.</p>
<p>"The Way of Benevolence" and the Reality</p>
<p>The above measures can be said to be a remedy for the symptoms, and the plan can be said to be well-rounded. The operating personnel can also be said to have made the greatest efforts. Chairman Song has replied to the five legislators of the Legislative Yuan, denying the accusation that he is not effective in implementing the emergency economic plan. However, some people still believe that although Song has worked hard and his plan is thorough, the implementation of various plans is not quick and strict enough. They believe that Song's "way of benevolence" is not enough to solve the current problem. It is said that Song once summoned the leaders of the financial industry in the city and severely warned them. Huo Shishu also announced on the spot that he had cracked down on more than 30 private radio stations and seized a lot of evidence of black market trading. If everyone does not make every effort to curb the black market, he will never be lenient. At that time, Director Li of the police bureau was also present. Everyone was so scared that they were sweating profusely. However, after the meeting, the financial black market activities resumed as usual. Therefore, people generally believe that although using harsh penalties in a chaotic world is not necessarily the best way. Since the currency reform in Guangzhou, although hundreds of cases of disrupting finance and violating price limits have been detected, few have been severely punished, which is somewhat suspected of condoning unscrupulous merchants!</p>
<p>Turning Nothing into Something</p>
<p>However, looking at it from another perspective, the formation of this market chaos is of course the responsibility of the government, but according to the actual situation, the general public should also bear a great responsibility. On the one hand, the objective situation has caused drastic price fluctuations, and the unsound psychology of the people is most likely to affect the implementation of all operating measures. In the past, during currency inflation, it is not surprising that people discriminated against national currency, but after the issuance of the gold yuan, it not only had full reserves, but also the issuance has not yet reached the full amount, so there is no reason for inflation, and commodities have not really been lacking. The situation is definitely not as serious as people think. However, the general public is creating trouble for themselves, rushing to buy, making general merchants holding goods think that they can make a killing. They stop selling and close down, so turning nothing into something. In fact, everyone should calm down a bit, understand the facts, and take out their conscience to assist the government in consolidating economic control and maintaining a stable life!</p>
<p>Qiongya Anti-Traitor Association Established</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Haikou, 19th] The Qiongya Anti-Traitor Association was reorganized and established on the 17th of this month. It held its first meeting with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. In addition to passing the association's organizational regulations, it also elected Wei Sansheng, Feng Xiju, Liang Qiwei, Qian Kaixin, and Li Dasheng and other nine people as standing directors, with Wei Sansheng concurrently serving as director-general and Li Dasheng as deputy director-general. The association's mission is to investigate and report corrupt officials, dirty officials, and local bullies. When necessary, special task forces will be set up to carry out missions. The predecessor of the association was the Qiongya Committee for Reporting Corruption from All Walks of Life, which was originally organized by people from this island traveling to the provincial capital. Later, because the people in charge returned to Qiong one after another, the association was established in this city, and it has made repeated achievements in cracking down on corruption and clarifying officialdom.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Li Chongfu, President of the Youyang Branch of the Sichuan High Court, took advantage of the remote location of Youyang to traffic in opium and even allowed his wife, Ms. Sun, to openly operate opium dens. Last August, Shi Keming and other residents of the township filed a complaint with Zhang Zhenyin, the chief prosecutor of the court, requesting a strict investigation. Zhang sent police on the 23rd of the same month to search the residence of Li's wife Sun, accompanied by the保甲 (local security force). They found opium pipes, lamps, and ash on Li's wife Sun's bed. They arrested Li's wife Sun and the opium den operator. While the case was being investigated, Zhou Bilu, the chief prosecutor of the Youyang Local Court, Wang Degui, the president of the court, and other members of Li's Gelaohui gang colluded with the county government of the special commissioner's office. When Zhang was interrogating Li's wife Sun, they instigated twenty to thirty thugs, including Li's sons and nephews, to snatch Li's wife Sun away, making it impossible to pursue the case. The next day, they dragged Zhang out of the house, beat him until he was injured, and the special commissioner's office sent more than twenty soldiers, armed with guns, to escort Zhang to the Youyang County Police Bureau for detention and interrogation. The soldiers then escorted him to the prosecutor's office of the local court, falsely accusing Zhang of disturbing public order and arbitrarily detaining him, and assigning ten soldiers to guard him for four days and nights. At the same time, many of Li's female relatives dragged Zhang's wife to the street, insulted her, tore her clothes, and took away her gold jewelry. Zhang was helpless and had to endure their violence and insults. Later, due to the indignation of the party groups and various organizations of the Youyang County Assembly, Zhang was released, while Li's wife Sun remained at large, openly smoking opium as usual. It was so dark and without light. After Zhang regained his freedom, he reported the injustice to the higher authorities last September, requesting a thorough investigation. The Ministry of Justice ordered the Sichuan High Court to transfer it to the Chongqing Branch to send someone to Youyang for a thorough investigation. However, the investigator was surrounded by Li's party and was unable to handle the case impartially. The investigator only considered it as a dispute between the court and the prosecutor's office and requested that personnel be adjusted. Recently, the President received another report, confirming that Zhang was earnestly handling the opium prohibition case in accordance with national policy. The report stated that he was insulted and detained by lower-level judicial officials colluding with administrative personnel, which was extremely outrageous. The President immediately ordered the Ministry of Justice to conduct a thorough investigation and handle the matter strictly in accordance with the law. In addition, the Law Officer Training Institute of the Judicial Yuan, Chaoyang College, and the students and villagers from Yixing, Jiangsu, in Beijing all expressed their indignation and repeatedly appealed to the authorities for justice, providing strong moral support.</p>

<p>— Our Correspondent, Zhu Xianggao</p>
<p>[Our Yixing Dispatch, 14th] It is undeniable that Chinese farmers are more hardworking and resilient than any other people in the world. They are the stalwarts of the land, not only toiling in agricultural production as adults, but also making full use of their agricultural off-season to engage in side occupations. Their lives are simple and honest, creating a fine tradition for centuries. Taking my hometown of Yixing as an example, in addition to a fertile farmland, the agricultural off-seasons of spring and winter are of great significance to them. By-products have a deeply rooted foundation in the countryside, such as spinning cotton, raising silkworms, and making grass paper—among which, pottery production is the most prominent. Speaking of pottery, the people of Yixing proudly say that it is a rare specialty. Since it represented national products at the Canadian Exposition in earlier years and was awarded the highest prize, it has become famous at home and abroad. Yixing pottery is used for decoration in luxurious living rooms. Although it is considered a treasure by foreigners, just like Jingdezhen porcelain, it has been shackled by a lack of progress and adherence to old ways. It has not been able to compete for a large amount of foreign exchange in the international market. In an era of rapid scientific advancement, although China's handicrafts cannot be said to have declined completely, they are at least on a downward slope. The current situation of Yixing's pottery kilns illustrates the serious crisis that Chinese handicrafts are facing in this era of rapid scientific progress.</p>
<p>Ding and Shu Towns</p>
<p>This time, the reporter accompanied local reporters on a special boat. At about 9 a.m., the motorboat entered the Jiu River from the inland river. The vast expanse of blue waves was dotted with sailboats, stretching as far as the eye could see. Before the war, the government had planned to renovate the east and west Jiu Rivers into parks, but shortly after, the incident occurred. Now, there is naturally nothing to talk about. Otherwise, if carefully organized, it could be compared to West Lake. At about 11 a.m., we arrived at Shushan Town, disembarked, and walked to Dingshan Town to inspect the pottery kilns in person. As early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, Fan Li took Xi Shi to live in seclusion in the county and called himself Tao Zhugong. Yixing pottery making has since been known to the world, which, calculating from Fan Li, has a history of more than 2,000 years. The reporter and a group of more than 20 people first inspected the raw materials for making pottery, located behind the streets of Ding and Shu towns. There are three hills in total, each covering an area of ​​tens of acres and reaching a height of ​​thirty to fifty zhang. Xilong Mountain is located to the west, and is commonly known as West Mountain. Huanglong Mountain is located to the east, and is commonly known as East Mountain. Together with Benshan, they form a tripod, hence the name Dingshan. Located at the foot of Shushan Mountain, it is named Shushan Town.</p>
<p>White Clay Field</p>
<p>The above-mentioned mountains produce green, yellow, purple, and various other colored soils. In addition, there is a solitary mountain more than 20 li away from Dingshan that specializes in producing white clay, commonly known as the White Clay Field, which is the source of all raw materials for making blanks. First, the soil is transported from the mountainous area, and then crushed with a stone roller by animal power. After grinding, the fineness of the powder is determined, and it is divided into coarse, fine, black, and yellow sand, according to grade, for making jars, urns, pots, and even delicate tea sets, which require the finest clay. After the water is mixed evenly, it can be handed over to technicians to make various pottery blanks according to the model. Then, it is transported to the drying yard to be blown by the wind. Once it is completely dry, it is glazed, and soon it can be loaded into the kiln, which is the most important juncture of the entire project. The kilns are like centipedes of various lengths and sizes, undulating and stretching continuously, hidden in the mountains and ridges, and are called Dragon Kilns by the people of Ding and Shu. Except for the lower entrance, which is the formal kiln opening, there is only one round hole at the bottom, which is the outlet for all flue gas and ash. On the left and right of the back, kiln windows are dug opposite each other every two feet. When the pottery blanks enter the kiln, they are stacked according to size, just like arranging jars and urns in layers, and even tea sets, placing them sequentially from the bottom to the opening. Then, the round holes in the back are closed with mud. If the kiln is loaded with coarse goods, pine branches and firewood are used, and if it is loaded with fine goods, thatch is used. The burning begins at the kiln opening.</p>
<p>Fire Watching Technicians</p>
<p>The success or failure of the entire kiln depends on whether the fire is used appropriately. Skilled workers must stay and watch the fire day and night. After a certain period of time, the kiln door is sealed with mud, and the first pair of window holes on the left and right of the back are opened. Fuel is burned in the first pair of holes, gradually moving upwards in sequence, until the last pair of window holes. Each medium-sized kiln takes about one day and night to stop burning, and then it takes two days to cool the kiln before the goods can be taken out. From the beginning to the end of this entire project, the categories of procedures are deeply divided and the boundaries are clearly defined, without any confusion. For example, a worker who makes urine pot blanks can only make urine pot blanks for the rest of his life. He cannot make anything else. Among all the technicians, the fire watching workers are the most important, because their work is crucial and related to the success or failure of the entire kiln. The living standards of all workers are quite high, and the fire watching technicians are the most well-off. On average, each person can get seven dou of white rice per day, and the rest of the workers have at least four dou. The ownership of the Dragon Kiln, like the landlords in other places, is regarded as a source of livelihood. Being able to own a kiln is called the richest person. Most of them are owned jointly by three to five or even a dozen families. The success or failure of a kiln greatly affects the life of the kiln household. As the saying goes, "Three kilns poor, three kilns rich." If the kiln is not operated well, it is common to lose everything, which forces the people in the area to become superstitious. Therefore, it is no wonder that they carry a shadow of misfortune when entering the blanks. After we finished watching all the Dragon Kilns on the four mountain ridges, we rushed to Tangdu Township, about three li away from the town, to inspect the area, which is famous for producing jars at the time. The kilns are built on flat ground, and the kiln tops are covered with shades to avoid sudden rain in summer and autumn. The equipment is complete and the products are particularly good. Dingshan Town mainly produces coarse goods, such as jars, urns, and household goods. Shushan Town produces fine goods, such as tea sets and decorations. Kiln households are most nervous when firing kilns, and they must not only pay attention to the strength of the fire, but also must not allow it to be interrupted. It is said that a kiln household, when firing the kiln for the first time, could not get enough fuel due to the interruption of fuel supply. He first chopped up the doors and windows of his house, and then even sent the bedclothes and clothing into the kiln. Standing on the top of the mountain, we saw smoke billowing everywhere all day long, stretching continuously. Therefore, the air in the area is particularly dry and the air dust is very low, which is quite harmful to human life. People who come here for the first time find it extremely difficult to bear.</p>
<p>Pottery Industry Guild</p>
<p>When we visited the Pottery Industry Guild, they expressed a "sigh of regret" about the future of pottery, which is about 70% of what it was before the war. According to the guild's statistics, there are about 5,000 technicians in total, and tens of thousands more people rely on it for food and clothing. In recent times, it has been difficult to maintain a livelihood and unable to bear the huge costs. Therefore, half of the Dragon Kilns have now been abandoned and production has been sharply reduced. Famous craftsmen such as Shao Quantong have formed the Shangyuan Pot and Jar Production Cooperative to revitalize the country, raising funds of several thousand dan of rice, producing and selling themselves. There is also the Tangdu Jar Production Cooperative, which is quite large in scale. The industry regards Tao Zhugong as its ancestor and enshrines him in the Kiln God Temple on the top of this mountain. The temple is unremarkable and no different from other desolate land temples.</p>
<p>Ceramics School</p>
<p>Finally, we rushed to see the Jiangsu Provincial Ceramics School established by the Department of Education, located in the center of the Dingshu Highway, surrounded by water on three sides. The environment is very beautiful. It is said that the original school building was destroyed by artillery fire, and the Democracy Hospital is now used as the school building. The principal is Wang Shijie. There are currently 40 students, who can graduate in three years. It is said that the school is stagnant and the students have little interest in the industry. Of course, the environment is also a factor. The lack of opportunities for handicrafts has led to a downward spiral. At its peak before the war, there were more than a thousand students, divided into ordinary and specialized, who graduated in six years. Now, although Principal Wang has worked hard to manage it, it is still difficult to improve. The new model kiln designed by teachers and students on the top of Huangshan is still spewing black smoke, which can be regarded as a reflection of the pre-war prosperity. The residents of the area use lime to build houses from broken and leaking urns and porcelain, which not only makes use of waste, but is also strong and durable. This is a unique phenomenon that is rarely seen in other places.</p>
<p>At 2 a.m. in the middle of the night, our group inspected the urban area. It is a miracle that such a great industrial area has no electric lighting equipment. The shops are deserted, with only county gas lamps. At this late hour, pedestrians seem to be coming and going continuously. One-third of the food shops have not yet closed, and the snack stalls along the street are lined up one after another, which is much more prosperous than Yicheng. There are not too many pottery shops selling in this town, but there are especially many restaurants and wine shops. All the technicians, because of their high income, must eat and drink to their heart's content before going to work, consuming at least half of their income. There are some workers from northern Jiangsu who are naturally diligent and thrifty. Although their income is high, they still try to save money. On the other hand, the demand for consumption is also great, and the prevalence of smoking and gambling is more prevalent than in other areas and more difficult to prohibit than in other areas. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the highway between Ding and Shu towns, about three li long, is both wide and flat, and is planted with weeping willows on both sides. Looking as far as the eye can see, the willow waves flutter, which is quite poetic and picturesque. Behind the trees, jars and porcelain are piled up like mountains, stretching endlessly. The current trend makes people feel a sense of "beauty in decline."</p>

<h3 id="e104">The First Batch Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month: Vietnamese and Burmese Rice Will Soon Be Shipped; National Bank Sends Telegram to President Weng to Actively Purchase Rice <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Central Bank officials revealed that our country's grain purchase quota in the Southeast Asian region totals 126,300 tons, worth US$31.68 million. Of this, rice from Inner Dha accounts for 68,000 tons, and Burmese rice accounts for 60,000 tons. Most of it will be purchased with funds under US aid, but the quantity will be determined after consultation with Washington; the balance will be purchased by our government, handled by the China Trust Bureau. Part of the rice from Vietnam and Burma will soon be shipped, and the first batch will arrive in Shanghai early next month.</p>
<p>According to further inquiries by the reporter, Central Bank officials have telegraphed President Weng, actively proceeding to purchase foreign rice. The telegram mainly included three points: (1) The third phase of US aid rice should be expedited. (2) The government should allocate foreign exchange to purchase 15,000 tons of rice from Burma and 4,000 tons from Annam; the Burmese rice portion will be settled in pounds sterling. (3) Please forward a telegram to Song Ziwen, asking him to assist in the purchase of Vietnamese and Burmese rice, so that it can be successful as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Rice Arrivals Increase; Market Trading Still Did Not Open Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Rice arrivals increased. Yesterday, the South Market reported a total of 1,070 shi, including 645 shi from rice stores, 85 shi from rice mills, 95 shi from sales agents, and 245 shi from rice firms. The North Market reported 704 shi from rice stores, 360 shi from sales agents, 213 shi from rice firms, and 462 shi from rice mills. Non-industry arrivals were 178 shi, totaling 1,917 shi. The two markets together totaled 2,987 shi of arrivals. Market trading still did not open. Market quotations included several types such as white japonica, thin rice, and special japonica, all priced at the original prices.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grain market was stagnant yesterday. The allocation of soybeans has been temporarily suspended because the proceeds from the sales of goods allocated in previous days have not been received from the tofu industry, so it is expected that allocation will continue today. Sesame, raw peanuts, and other miscellaneous grains were not opened.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Tight Credit Conditions Slightly Eased <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, credit conditions in the market were still tight. General overnight rates were still between 6.5 yuan and 7 yuan per thousand yuan, but because several Chinese commercial banks had obtained interbank loans from foreign banks, the supply was more abundant. At the same time, the rush to purchase has gradually subsided. After the merchants sold their goods, they were unable to replenish them, and they released their cash for high interest rates while the dark interest rate was high.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recently, the high dark interest rates in South China have caused a large outflow of funds from this city. The reporter inquired with the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Jianghai Customs yesterday about the investigation of passengers carrying cash. According to reports, the customs only announced and implemented the regulation limiting each passenger traveling to Guangdong to carry 1,000 yuan on the 21st, so there were no restrictions before the announcement. However, in the past few weeks, no incidents of carrying large amounts of cash southward have occurred. It is said that passengers transporting cash mostly take the Yuehan Railway southward.</p>

<p>The National Treasury Bureau Announces Four Measures</p>
<p>The National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has recently issued a circular to all branches and offices, stating that in order to assist post offices in allocating treasury funds, four measures were previously stipulated. Now, in order to assist the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank in allocating the difference between the total deposits received and paid, it is also permitted to handle according to the previous measures.</p>
<p>The four measures for assisting post offices in allocating treasury funds are as follows: (1) When post offices need to request the bank to assist in allocating the difference between the total deposits received and paid, they should list the funds received and paid on behalf of the treasury and send them to the district treasury for verification, and the bank will allocate them free of charge. (2) The allocation area is limited to within this district, and cannot be allocated from District A to District B. (3) The number of allocations is limited to once per month. (4) The request for allocation period is limited to two months, and overdue requests will be considered abandoned.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the financial authorities, the foreign exchange transferred and deposited by money shops with the National Bank is no different from the people who hold gold and banknotes and go to the National Bank to exchange them for gold yuan notes. Therefore, the foreign exchange transferred and deposited can be allocated to the cash portion of the capital increase. The authorities have convened a meeting of money shop representatives to discuss this matter, and there should be no problems in its implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Strong Buying Interest in Export Tea <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the inland sales of fancy Tianjin tea were still stagnant due to difficult transportation. However, sales in this street and the areas of Su, Xi, and Chang continued to be good, so the market atmosphere was not lonely. It is a pity that transactions were not smooth due to the scarcity of goods, but the situation was quite stable and promising.</p>
<p>It is reported that recently, there has been a creeping trend in various routes in Jiaxing for coarse red and green tea. Currently, Xinmao Chun Tea Firm is in negotiations with merchants from that area. As for the foreign tea market, the process continues to be like a fish in water. Although exports to foreign countries are still declining, the appetite of exporters is still strong, so the market is full of buying interest. However, the gap between the two sides in negotiations is large, and the initial opening ended in flatness.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Taiwan Sugar Supply Scarce <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still scarce in transactions. The association's allocation matters are being actively handled. Due to the discussion of registering inventory and concentrating sales among colleagues, there is no need to buy and sell again in the market, so the market situation has become deserted. The sugar refiners in this street have been selling well in the past few days due to the brisk sales of candies and pastries, and the demand is quite high. The supply of southern goods firms is decreasing day by day because the quota has not been determined.</p>

<p>The China Trust Bureau has previously issued 13 issues of the group profit-sharing savings certificate. After the currency system reform, the method has been revised and approved by the Ministry of Finance for implementation.</p>
<p>The 14th issue of the savings certificate is scheduled to be sold simultaneously across the country starting on November 1st. 50,000 households form a group. Each depositor deposits 2 gold yuan at a time, and can be divided into two sub-households, each sub-household depositing 1 gold yuan. The first prize winner can receive 5,000 gold yuan, 5 households can each receive 200 gold yuan, and 2,500 households can receive 2 yuan. The term is 6 months, but withdrawals are not allowed.</p>

<p>It is reported that the customs has notified various transportation firms that dyes are temporarily prohibited from leaving the country, resulting in a weakening of the dye market yesterday, with scarce supply and demand. However, prices are still hovering at firm levels. Also, sales at the doors of various dye shops have been brisk in recent days. In addition to limiting the quantity purchased, the seals are also unsealed on the spot to avoid the malpractices of speculative purchases and hoarding.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The sales quantity of state-owned enterprise stocks has increased considerably recently. It is reported that on the 19th of this month, a total of 99,700 gold yuan were sold in the five major cities, bringing the total sales to 4,517,400 gold yuan. This includes 2,982,000 gold yuan for textile construction, 50,500 gold yuan for China Merchants Group, 1,336,700 gold yuan for China Paper, 144,200 gold yuan for China Paper, and 4,000 gold yuan for Tianjin Paper.</p>

<p>The cigarette trend is declining, and colleagues are all handling inventory registration procedures. Holders of goods are not moving their inventory casually because the registration procedures have not been completed, so transactions are still taking the line of friendly relations. Daily necessities are still popular under the scarce source of supply from the factory. Recently, sales of Another Star cigarettes have still been good, and it is said that prices in other ports are very high, and vendors are still searching for purchases, and quotations are still firm.</p>
<h3 id="e115">(Total Import and Export Value in August; Import Surplus of 240 Billion Legal Tender) <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The national import and export trade figures for August have been compiled by the Directorate General of Customs. The net value of imported goods was 1,259,262,354,730 legal tender, and the net value of exported goods was 1,010,378,829,790 legal tender. The import surplus was 248,883,524,940 legal tender, an increase of more than 421.4 billion legal tender compared to the July export surplus of 172,519,746,060 legal tender.</p>
<p>From January to August of this year, except for July, which was an export surplus, the remaining months were all import surpluses. The import surplus figures for each month of this year are listed below in legal tender:</p>
<p>January import surplus: 34,173,468 yuan. February import surplus: 24,455,084 yuan. March import surplus: 304,237,834 yuan. April import surplus: 258,775,118 yuan. May import surplus: 515,602,150 yuan. June import surplus: 13,983,619 yuan. Including the above-mentioned August import surplus, and offsetting the July export surplus, the total import surplus from January to August of this year was still 211,486,506,200 legal tender.</p>
<p>In August, animal and animal products accounted for the largest share of exports, with a value of more than 260 billion legal tender. The second largest was cloth, with a value of more than 233.211 billion legal tender.

<h3 id="e116">After the Truth About Yarn and Cloth Exchange, Distribution Will Gradually Decrease <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The date of the next distribution of cotton cloth has not been determined, and it is feared that it will be one of the last distributions. According to the person in charge of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, once the issue of the exchange of re-spun yarn and cloth is agreed upon, it will have a major impact on the cotton cloth industry. According to the Supervisory Office, yarn mills will be able to obtain legal profits after paying processing fees for the cloth made from yarn distributed to re-processors. The same applies to the dyeing and weaving industry. The cloth will then be returned to the yarn mills and transported to the production areas or abroad to exchange for cotton. However, cotton cloth, whether retail or wholesale, will be sold at limited prices based on inventory. If it is not distributed in the future, it will eventually be sold out, and there will be no way to replenish it, resulting in many difficulties.</p>
<p>Also reported: The Cotton Cloth Association had originally scheduled the fourth round of distribution to private factories in the dyeing and weaving industry yesterday afternoon, but it was temporarily suspended due to technical problems with the allocation and because some of the waybills had not been collected. It is said that the allocation will be made next Monday.</p>
<p>(Spinning Construction Opens Yarn)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to be suspended. The Spinning Construction Company opened yarn as usual, including 20-count Double Happiness large package at 700 yuan (blue list), and 15-count Bumper Harvest straw package at 573 yuan. 32-count Yanghe cone yarn at 787 yuan. 40-count Sunlight cone yarn at 880 yuan, 40-count three-strand Shiguang straw package at 1,030 yuan, and 40-count three-strand limited (wood yarn group industry) application, 32-count limited (electrical group C and D), and 15-count and 20-count Double Happiness limited (dyeing factory bed sheet industry) can choose any one, and applicants were very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Also reported: The Inspection Committee has decided to use in advance the yarn and cloth seized in various warehouses in the city that has been hoarded for more than three months. As for the method of use, according to news from the Economic Control Supervisory Office, it will be divided into two parts, one part for distribution and one part for transportation to rice-producing areas to exchange for food. It is feared that the rumor that it will be sold off will be difficult to implement.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Silk and Satin Desolate <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Because goods from China Trust Bureau will arrive soon, the silk weaving industry is waiting for distribution of the next allocation, and people are calm. Small silk factories that have not received an allocation have limited inventory in the past. In the midst of this raw material depletion, they feel unable to maintain operations. The association is distributing only about 30 small packages, but because the source is unsustainable, the allocation amount cannot be increased either.</p>
<p>For export raw silk, it is said that some goods have arrived at other ports, but the opening price offered by foreign firms is not high, and deals cannot be reached. For domestic sales, silk factories still have an appetite, but holders are not willing to sell, and the market is still desolate.</p>
<p>Recently, many silk and satin factories have been undertaking weaving of export products with allocated raw materials. There are very few shipments of goods made from self-purchased raw materials, and it has been stipulated that domestic sales goods will be jointly distributed by the association, so each factory is no longer opening goods independently. Small silk factories have neither obtained an allocation of raw materials nor undertaken weaving, and most of them have no raw materials to weave, so there are even fewer shipments. Wholesalers have little intention of selling their inventory, and transactions are not progressing. The market is desolate.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Part of the Purchase Price for Raw Cotton Will Be Matched with Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>It is said that Mr. Weiweijing, General Manager of the Cotton Joint Purchasing Office, said that since the beginning of the purchase work at the various branches of the office, the factory has had considerable difficulty due to the impact of the price limit. In order to facilitate the purchase work, the office has decided to transport a batch of yarn and cloth stored in the city to various places and deliver it to the seller together with cash to facilitate the purchase of raw cotton.</p>
<p>Also, according to news from the US Aid Cotton Yarn and Cloth Joint Management Office, some of the teams dispatched by the office to various places to inspect the actual number of spindles in operation at various factories have reported their findings. This report will be used as a reference for the second batch of US cotton allocation.</p>

<p>[Dahua News Agency] This month's specially allocated rice for employees of private schools in the city will be distributed directly by the Civil Food Allocation Committee because rice shops are crowded with people buying household rice. The secondary schools will collect their rice separately from the Civil Food Allocation Committee, but because there are so many elementary schools, the Civil Food Allocation Committee, lacking manpower, is asking neighboring schools to automatically prepare rosters for approximately 200 party members, affixing the school seal, and sending a representative to take the rice allocation certificates and special allocation certificates to the Civil Food Allocation Committee on the 28th of this month to pay and collect the rice.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] Hu Shih flew back to Peiping from Shanghai today and spoke to reporters about several matters: (1) Regarding the visit to Japan, he said that it was not as definite as Shao Yulin had stated. If he has time next year, he will take a trip, and Shi Jingsheng will go with him. Regarding the level of democracy in Japan, Hu Shih quoted Li Ji as saying, "Judging by the excellence of their national voting, it may be more thorough than ours." (2) He will go to Australia next March for a month to visit the seven universities there to increase his understanding of countries in the Pacific. He also wants to visit New Zealand if he has the opportunity. Hu Shih praised the democratic system and social legislation of Australia and New Zealand as being top-notch and advanced countries in the Pacific. (3) He brought back a treasure this time, namely the first half of the "Commentary on the Water Classic" from the Yongle Encyclopedia, which is treasured by the Commercial Press. Hu Shih said that this is the best and most complete rare book. The second half is in the collection of Li Xuanbo, the nephew of Li Shizeng of Gaoyang, who gave it to Peking University a few years ago. This time, the two halves are reunited and will be exhibited together with dozens of other items at the 50th anniversary of Peking University. (4) Regarding financial reforms, Hu Shih reiterated his opinion that after more than two months, the advantages and disadvantages are already apparent, and the government should immediately invite domestic experts and scholars to study and determine the reforms. Because they are not people in the speculative market, their views are free and appropriate, and he hopes that people from Peking University and Tsinghua University will participate. (5) Discussing the issue of university funding, Hu Shih said that before the currency reform, salaries accounted for 99% of the total funding. After the currency reform, the research funding for one department of the medical school was only equivalent to 7.5 US dollars, and the dean resigned because of this. Peking University has recently proposed a concrete proposal, which was approved by the president's meeting in Peking and agreed to by the Ministry of Education, and may be implemented next year. According to this proposal, salaries will account for 60% of the total funding, with the remaining 40% used for running the school, 20% for academic research, 15% for operating expenses, 3% for general lecturer fees, and 2% for miscellaneous expenses. Finally, a reporter asked Hu Shih if he had discussed the issue of the university returning to the south in Peking. Hu Shih waved his hand, saying that it is best not to talk about this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Feelings About Rush-Buying Tobacco by Ji Yong <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>These days, newspapers are rarely without talk of rush-buying, even trains are crowded. It is said that wealthy young men, fearing the loss of opportunities for timely enjoyment, are taking the opportunity to visit Suzhou and Hangzhou before prices officially skyrocket. I live in Suzhou, and sure enough, the Tiger Hill scenic area has been very lively these past few days. According to local newspaper reports today, even a high-ranking official from the Ministry of Transportation could not squeeze onto the train and had to jump in through the window of a mail car, temporarily becoming a piece of mail.</p>
<p>However, this is all irrelevant. My feelings arose from the two queues I saw this morning for buying rice and tobacco. Although Suzhou is a land of fish and rice, nowadays rice can only be bought by the liter. The day before yesterday, each person could be allocated five liters, but yesterday it was only two. However, the rice queue I saw this morning had two characteristics that clearly distinguished it from the tobacco queue: (1) the number of people was relatively small; (2) everyone quietly lined up and waited for the door to open, with some women taking the opportunity to knit sweaters. The tobacco queue, on the other hand, was terrible. There were at least one or two hundred people at one shop, some even standing on other people's shoulders, grabbing and snatching, with no order whatsoever. So I pondered in my heart, is smoking more important than eating? But looking at those rush-buying friends, they were definitely not "Analects" types, not one of them with a scholarly air, thinking of increasing their "spirit of smoking" with "Big Cannon Tower" cigarettes. On the contrary, most of them were working-class types, the so-called scalpers. Only then did I suddenly realize the truth: rush-buying rice is for eating, while rush-buying tobacco is for profit. There are fewer people who are buying for eating, and they are still somewhat leisurely, while there are more people who are buying for profit, and they are disregarding their lives at the same time.</p>
<p>Fame and fortune are inherently helpless, but when it comes to the edge of starvation, most people still tend towards profit, and this phenomenon is worth studying. Human history for thousands of years is actually a history of struggle. What is the object of struggle? In short, it is "profit"! For one's own livelihood is certainly profit, but exceeding one's own enjoyment is even greater profit. Where profit lies, there is no limit to its size, even if there is equal harm accompanying it, it is still ignored and blindly pursued. For example, every day there are people who are sued or even executed for price gouging or corruption, but this does not reduce price gouging and corruption in society. The people who are currently "gouging" and "corrupting" will not wash their hands because they are warned. They understand legal provisions better than judges in their hearts, but they cannot resist their covetousness for gold yuan and enjoyment. Someone once said that the evolution of history is quantitative rather than qualitative. People in ancient times invaded others and other tribes for their own benefit, and people today still do the same. The ancient people used spears and swords, and the modern people use tanks and airplanes, that's all. Some even say that human culture is an extension of animal culture. Animals use claws and poison to harm their own kind, while humans use various weapons to kill those of the same kind with round skulls and square feet. This statement also makes sense. Recently, someone interviewed the American scientific authority on atomic energy, Dr. Albert Einstein, and asked him what kind of weapons would be used in the Third World War. He replied humorously, "I don't know about the Third World War, but I know for sure about the Fourth." The interviewer was surprised and asked why. Einstein smiled and said, "With stones." What he meant was that three world wars would destroy all of humanity, and what is called culture would no longer exist, so the world would return to chaos, and humanity would return to its origins, so when fighting, they would have to use stones. Assuming that this is inferred, who knows whether our hundreds of thousands of years of civilization, from "Peking Man" to the atomic bomb era, had not existed a million years ago? It's just because everyone is fighting for profit, making chaos come again. It really seems like Zhuangzi said, "Suddenly a sudden one 　 Chaos of it, and Chaos died." Since humanity has had a love of profit, humanity has been doomed to perish.</p>
<p>It's strange, every invention is first used for war tools to protect oneself and one's own interests or to invade the interests of others. At the beginning of the Bronze Age, Guan Zhong said, "Good gold is used to cast swords, and bad gold is used to cast hoes." The hoes used for production are far less important than the swords used for killing. Nobel invented smokeless gunpowder, originally for opening mountains and mining, but unexpectedly it was used for cannons and machine guns. Einstein's atomic energy was also first tasted by Japanese devils, and now it has become a secret that the world is scrambling to seize, making this old man complain. Some people say that atomic energy will soon be used in industry, but my view is that if there is no newer weapon to replace it, there will never be a possibility of using it for production. It is today's "good gold," and only "bad gold" is used for production! It's also like how the scalpers can make the greatest effort to rush-buy tobacco, and if they have extra energy, they will use it to rush-buy rice.</p>
<p>If I were the authorities, I would definitely open up the sale of cigarettes, allowing the prices to rise at will, and the cigarette factories would extract a certain number of cartons every day and distribute them free of charge to writers, distributed by various publishing agencies. Otherwise, both rice and cigarettes would be price-limited, but after buying cigarettes, it would not be allowed to buy rice. However, the latter method would inevitably make it difficult for friends who like to smoke, such as Mr. Zeshi, so the first method would still be appropriate. (Editor's note: Mr. Zeshi once published an article in this column entitled "Talking About Paper," saying that tobacco has become one of the daily necessities.)</p>
<h3 id="e139">On Vegetarianism <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Why Bother</p>
<p>These past few days, we have all been forced to be practitioners of vegetarianism.</p>
<p>Regardless of how Buddhist and health advocates promote the benefits of vegetarianism for the body, regardless of how George Bernard Shaw's longevity is attributed to his strict vegetarian diet, regardless of how moralists attack meat-eaters as base, I never believe that humans should be vegetarians and not eat meat. Therefore, these past few days of vegetarianism, we certainly feel helpless, and only hope that this abnormal situation can be cleared up as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Judging from the actual situation, the problem is not the scarcity of meat such as fish, chicken, and shrimp, but the abnormal supply. Why is it that many large restaurants still have fish and meat as usual, while in small vegetable markets they are extremely rare? The few that are available require queuing and waiting from six o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock before they can be bought. Each person must have a number written on their body with chalk. To put it tragically, it is like prisoners receiving rations, but this "ration" still has to be exchanged with money.</p>
<p>If vegetarianism is feasible, then it would be better to simply let everyone in the world eat a vitamin pill that can prevent hunger, like the legendary elixir of immortality in ancient China, and not eat human food, how pleasant and convenient would that be? In fact, in addition to filling their stomachs, humans also need to satisfy at least the minimum level of their appetite. Of course, "Yi Ya's taste is universally appreciated." We are advocating frugality in this era, not to promote the delicacies of mountains and seas, nor to teach every household to live in luxury. At the very least, people should be able to obtain some nutrition so that these already thin people have some food to replenish their strength.</p>
<p>When the World Games open in London, what will our athletes eat? Preserved eggs and canned food, and supposedly some ham. But compared to the food of athletes from Britain and the United States, our athletes are far behind. With poor nutritional supply, it is difficult to compete with others in the competition. However, I believe that what Chinese athletes eat overseas is still considered top-notch. Isn't it just simple meals in the country? The body's nutrition cannot be achieved overnight. If you want a strong physique, you must pay attention to nutrition, which is related to your health, from early on.</p>
<p>Absolute vegetarianism is as unworkable as absolute meat-eating. Usually, our food is mostly a combination of vegetarian and meat dishes, which have a mutual effect. We have an idiom in our hometown that says, "Rice is the root, meat is the branch," meaning that for a person's nutrition, meat treats the branch, and rice treats the root. Most Chinese people do not eat cod liver oil, do not get booster shots, and do not have Sanatogen and multiple vitamin pills. Their health is maintained by meat and rice alone. Therefore, my conclusion is: I do not support long-term vegetarianism!</p>
<h3 id="e140">A Record of a Visit to the Vegetable Market <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Commentator</p>
<p>Because he couldn't buy the food he needed in the vegetable market, the cook hired by the group submitted his "resignation": unless someone accompanies him to buy food, he will never go to the vegetable market alone. Although colleagues felt that going to the vegetable market was troublesome, they finally decided to take turns going to the vegetable market with the cook every day: to decide what to buy and how to buy it; as for the basket, of course, the cook would carry it. In other words, the cook who carries the basket is always the same one, and the one who "partners" with him is the one on duty.</p>
<p>I have never been to the vegetable market to buy food, and now I have to experience the taste of going to the vegetable market as a housewife. This taste is really not very pleasant: circling between the vegetable stalls, squeezing through the crowd, walking on wet and slippery ground, smelling the fishy and smelly odors. Buying meat and fish requires "standing in line" and waiting respectfully. It is lucky to buy them. Maybe you will be pushed and squeezed and fall to the ground, which would be terrible!</p>
<p>After waiting in a relatively short line, I bought the fish, and then my eyes turned to the vegetables.</p>
<p>There are only a few kinds of vegetables! The chicken mustard is not to my liking, the cabbage has traces of insect bites, and I'm afraid the radish is hollow... Should I not buy them? How will I explain it when I get back? And what will we eat?</p>
<p>"Why are the good cabbages all infested with insects?" Knowing that this question is meaningless, but after flipping through the cabbage, I walked away. The reason seemed insufficient, and I was afraid of being scolded, so I took preemptive action in order to retreat safely. Unexpectedly, the vegetable stall owner calmly said, "The ones that aren't infested have all been sold! You're late!"</p>
<p>I turned around to leave, and the cook who was carrying the basket protested:</p>
<p>"Forget it, don't run around anymore, anyway, all the cabbages you find will be infested." So, I made a deal with this cabbage stall owner. I looked at the watch on my wrist, pointing to 8:16.</p>

<p>That beautiful lion tamer stood still, biting on a piece of white sugar. A ferocious lion roared and pounced, biting the white sugar from the tamer's lips.</p>
<p>"There's nothing special about that, I can do it too!" a young man shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Dare you?" The circus lady said with a sneer.</p>
<p>"Of course! I can do better than the lion!"</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>A short three months together, I clearly saw your heart and soul. Your talent roars like illness, Who will appreciate your good poems? The wilderness road of Dian and Shu, A humble gift at Yanjin's ferry. This journey is not your choice, Your disappointment is also bitter.</p>
<p>You are like an untamed horse, And I am an unbridled donkey. No tears to shed at parting, But home is still far away. Fame is as thin as dust, Sweat and blood under the dim lamp. This meaning travels a thousand miles, We look forward to competing for the top!</p>
<p>Gold often suffers hardship, A red heart always supports the sky. No way to serve the country? I pity my own writing. My promise is firm, See you again next year! When old friends ask, My beard is gray but my bones are still strong.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Impressions of Guangzhou <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Mu</p>
<p>A friend of mine went to Hong Kong on business a month ago. Recently, after completing his work, he returned to Shanghai via Guangzhou and described to me his experiences in Guangzhou, which gave me a vivid and deep impression.</p>
<p>It is said that Guangzhou's urban area is vast, and the population is dense, not inferior to Shanghai. The housing shortage problem is particularly serious, and there are very few houses for rent. The city's main roads are wide and flat, and the buildings along the roads often extend beyond the sidewalks, supported by pillars. When it rains, walking under the buildings can prevent you from getting wet, which is somewhat similar to the Jinling East Road area of Shanghai. However, the narrow streets and alleys often have twists and turns, and there are few straight and cross-roads that lead in all directions.</p>
<p>Those who visit Guangzhou for the first time find it quite novel that the roofs of some buildings are level with the road surface, or even lower than the road. This is because the terrain in Guangzhou is uneven, and some roads are filled in on low-lying areas, resulting in this phenomenon. Visitors must step down to visit the residents there.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Eat in Guangzhou." Guangzhou residents seem to be very interested in eating. Whether they are from middle or lower-class families, they all go to restaurants for breakfast to eat small snacks such as sesame paste and fish porridge. The prices are quite expensive, but the restaurants are crowded in the morning, and the profits are tripled. From the restaurants, one can also glimpse the "tough" character of the Cantonese people, who are not accommodating. For example, shops that specialize in selling sweets do not sell salty food, and vice versa. In addition, the same shop stipulates that it will supply a certain dim sum in the morning and another dim sum in the afternoon. If you ask for a dim sum other than the stipulated one, you cannot buy it. This is quite different from Shanghai's Wu Fang Zhai, which sells large meat noodles and fish noodles, and also sells mung bean soup and candied sweet potatoes depending on the season.</p>
<p>Guangzhou people are very frugal and casual in their clothing. In summer, most people wear silk gauze trousers and wooden clogs, even rickshaw pullers cannot avoid this. Pulling a rickshaw while dragging wooden clogs naturally makes them pull very slowly.</p>
<p>Daily necessities in Guangzhou, such as rice, vegetables, meat, and cloth, are more expensive than in Shanghai. Before the currency reform, the legal currency inflated too much, and most of the transactions in the urban area were based on Hong Kong dollars. However, since the issuance of the gold yuan coupon, the market has stabilized. The exchange rate between Hong Kong dollars and gold yuan coupons is also regulated, which shows that the credit is well-established and deeply trusted by the people.</p>
<p>Speaking of Guangzhou women, the daughters of the South are known for their passion. My friend believes that they wear a lot of makeup, such as smearing dark circles around their eyes, applying powder, and dabbing rouge. As the poem of the ancients says, "Light makeup and heavy makeup are both suitable." Guangzhou women belong to the heavy makeup type.</p>

<p>One day, in Adelaide, Australia, a woman boarded a bus, wanting to find a seat. At that time, a male passenger stood up politely and gave her his seat. She thanked him casually and was about to sit down when she suddenly caught a glimpse of the man's face. She suddenly cried out, "George!" and fainted to the ground, unconscious.</p>
<p>It turned out that the man who gave up his seat was her husband, who had been missing for a long time after joining the army and was said to have been killed in action.</p>
<p>The man was shocked and jumped up. At that time, the ticket seller and other passengers had rushed over to take care of the woman. They helped her up. The man stared at the woman's face blankly, as if drunk or in a dream. Slowly, his dull eyes came to life, and he woke up as if from a dream, recognizing that this was his long-lost wife. It turned out that he had suffered severe brain trauma on the battlefield and developed a disease. He had forgotten who he was and where he lived. Even after the war ended, he still wandered around in a semi-conscious state. Even though he wandered to his hometown, he was unaware of it. It wasn't until this moment that he woke up and the couple was reunited.</p>
<p>This is a recent true story, and the Associated Press of the United States has reported this news.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Answering Readers' Questions Regarding Student Aid <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>And Please All Schools Promptly Submit the List of Free Students to the Scholarship Review Committee</p>
<p>In the past week, we have received many letters from readers asking about the payment date of the Shen Bao Reader's Student Aid. We are now giving a general response here.</p>
<p>The "Reader's Student Aid" for this year began soliciting donations in July and began accepting applications in late August. The newspaper completed the preliminary review of all 300+ applications in late September and submitted the applications to the Municipal Scholarship Review Committee for review. According to the Committee's regulations, students applying for student aid from any organization or group must have the school they are attending have a prescribed number of free student slots before they can be approved. This is a necessary measure to prevent schools from "being generous at the expense of others." However, to this day, nearly half of the schools whose students have applied for student aid from this newspaper have been slow to submit the list of free students to the Committee, or even if they have submitted it, the required number of free slots is insufficient. According to the investigation, the secondary schools that have not yet submitted the list of free students for review include Hu Xin, Guanghua Affiliated High School, St. Francis, Zhen Dan Affiliated High School, Patriotic Girls' High School, Minli, China, Weiyu, Southeast, Zhengzhong, Zhengzhong Girls' High School, Xuhui Girls' High School, Huaien, YMCA, Qixiu Girls' High School, Xinhua, Dajiang, Dade Midwifery, Lixing, Sino-French, Qingxin, Mengxian, Law School Affiliated High School, and Minzhi - a total of 24 schools. As for those with an insufficient number of free student slots, there are Datong Affiliated High School (Campus 1 and 2), Minli Girls' High School, Chongshi, Xiaoguang, Shenjiang Girls' High School, Jingwen Girls' High School, Qianghua Technical College, Xihua, and Guangcheng Technical College - a total of ten schools. Therefore, the reason why the student aid from this newspaper cannot be distributed quickly is not due to this newspaper, nor is it due to the Review Committee.</p>
<p>The Review Committee has now ordered the aforementioned schools to submit their applications by the end of this month. We sincerely hope that the authorities of the aforementioned schools can submit the list of free students as soon as possible within the deadline so that the impoverished students who are waiting anxiously every day can receive the student aid as soon as possible and can study with peace of mind.</p>
