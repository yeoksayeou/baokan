<p>〔又電〕遼南戰事緊張階段中，遼西醞釀新局勢，某地國軍雲集，咸信熱遼西走廊形勢即將不變，葫蘆島，營口破冰船集結（營口已解凍），營口國軍並砲擊港口冰面，以便利航行，遼陽匪有動搖之勢。共匪亦雲集於新民大虎山，一部南下增援溝帮子，十八日溝帮子北鎭間集結共匪逾一縱隊，並續集結中。共匪爲阻國軍東進，有再撲大凌河企圖，日來大凌河入夜情况極緊，刻大凌河錦州間國軍正加强警戒中。瀋西匪一，十兩縱隊及另一部匪，現向瀋北開原地區集結，有窺鐵嶺企圖。</p>

<p>〔中央社安哥拉十八日電〕土耳其民主黨機關報「權力」報稱：蘇聯目前最重要之擴張方案，厥在赤化中國，同時，中國共產黨刻正陰謀奪取瀋陽，以使其成爲赤都也。該報繼稱：倘瀋陽落入共產黨手中，全部中國東北，即將爲共產黨所控制，共產黨自喪失其延安老巢後，即未有固定都城，故彼等刻正陰謀擬在瀋陽建立新赤都，自吾人觀之，德國與希臘，似爲第三次世界大戰之火藥庫，但吾人實不應忘記中國問題，迄今實較上述二國共產黨經常受有蘇聯裝備，而且中國共產黨控制地區與蘇聯接壤，致不幸使中國情勢較往時益形黑暗。美，蘇兩國在中國造成之爭逐敵對形勢，較世界任何其他地區更爲嚴重，其規模更大，條聯慫慂與裝備中國共產黨，或係克里姆林宮對外擴張方案中之最重要項目，其發展嚴重，影響世界和平。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平十九日電〕馬占山將軍』九日單獨吿合衆社稱：其舊部尙有三十萬人「困處」於東北無人地帶，如政府予以武裝，渠準備率此三十萬人在故土與共匪作戰。渠稱：如東北國軍能固守「二三月之久」，期內渠能配備組織所部，則此一計劃可使東北情形改觀，並稱：中共後方今日在東北地主之控制下，彼等被中共淸算後，即團結一致，彼等以紅鬍子姿態爲生存而戰，然彼等實在並非紅鬍子。「彼等總數在三五十萬之間，如政府伸出手，彼等均將歸順」。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕上週四倫敦泰晤士報社論論及中國國民黨與中國共產黨的政策，謂無多大分別。該報認兩黨政策，都在求一黨專政，脫不了國家主義的意味，都不願有民主政體。其差別只在他們所代表階級利益與擁護他們的份子的不同云云。中央社記者曾就此事走訪吳鐵城，請對此發表評論。（下接二版一攔）</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕杜魯門總統十八日要求國會通過五億七千萬美元有限經濟援華計劃後，共和黨發言人立即指責此項計劃爲「不充分」，因其未包括軍事援助在內。總統在其特別咨文中承認，渠之建議，除開延緩中國經濟解體以外，不能有更大幫助，取並小心避免爲蔣主席在反共內戰中請求軍事援助，此項遺漏，遭到參院撥款委員會主席勃里奇嚴厲之批評。按勃氏爲國會中主張以軍事及經濟援華最力之人。渠稱：中國戰後之困難，已超越經濟援助所能挽回大勢範圍之外，渠促人注意前總統特使魏德邁將軍，曾力促渠之撥款委員會對蔣主席予以軍事接濟品。渠稱：「如美國在同一時期，由於懈怠，任令中國淪於共黨手中，則數十億阻止歐洲共黨蔓延之費用，將毫無意識。」勃里奇繼稱：美國應派遣一有力而直接之代表，保護其在南京之利益。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處南京十八日電〕美國駐華大使司徒雷登，今日下午發表致中國人民書，全文如次：</p>
<p>由杜魯門總統向國會所提聲明中，諸君已獲悉美國正擬努力援助中國人民。因此，本八願借此試向諸君解釋決定美國對華政策之各種目標，及其所引起之問題。本人因生於貴國。長於貴國，且對貴國福利之關切，亦不亞於諸君，故擬本此立塲，試作解釋</p>
<p>幸喜美國政府與人民所期望於中國者，亦即一切眞誠愛國的中國人民本身現正努力爭取者，此即中國之自由與獨立，國內和平與繁榮，以及眞正現代化民主玫府之建立。吾美國人所期望者，僅此而已。</p>
<p>人之同　爲如何援助抗戰勝利以來遭受內戰痛苦最深之平民。彼等所要求者，乃能在一關切彼等福利之政府下，享受和平及從布生產活動。</p>
<p>具體言之，問題重點在增進一般平民福利，且使其不受極端反動自私份子與極端激烈份子横暴革命手段之威脅。此二集團均有嚴密組織，且兩者均認爲黨派與個人利益，遠高於貧苦民衆之利益。</p>
<p>吾美國人信仰民主政治，且認爲如時機適當，時間充裕，民主政治在中國必能通行。自消極方面而言，民主政府可保障人民日常生活之自由及免於恐懼之自由。自積極方面而言，且可造成一環境，使較爲賢明進步之領導者，得以教育並多方面協助普通公民了解在民主生活中之義務與權利，且本法治精神，不隨個人好懇，循憲政程序而將其實際運用。根據中國歷史敎訓，羣衆每願追隨其所信任而有品德之賢明領袖。如將中國故有民主方式用作現代憲治程序，則目下全國及各省與地方政府中之貪汚，或無能份子，將不難逐漸淸除，而代以人民所自由選任本公益執行公務之人員。</p>
<p>本人與中國學生相處甚久，故深知其愛國理想。不論彼等已畢業，服務政府，從事敎育，經營商業，　担任其他工作，或仍在校求學，均應領事此項愛國工作。以其大公無私之榜樣，彼等必能克服祗知忠於黨，不容忍其他政治信仰，採用强暴手段，企圖毀滅公私財物及將刧奪與戰爭之恐怖加諸無事人民，以求達成其專横目的之另一極端。</p>
<p>吾美國人在馬歇爾先生領導下，業已竭盡所能，防止現有局勢之發展，及其對中國人民所招致之痛苦。惟鑒於中美兩國人民之傳統友誼，且深信中國人民之經濟福利將促進世界幸福，故吾人擬借經濟援華計劃，使中國政府及人民能獲另一時機，開始建立中國之經濟復興與安定。</p>
<p>但工作責任　心，仍在中國人民本身。不論美國物質援助之數量如何，及其專門顧問之人數如何，均不足以供應中國政治安定與經濟復興之需求。最主要之力量，仍爲中國人民，且尙須有犧牲小我爲公共福利努力之赤誠決心。</p>
<p>自由與民主之意義，原不應發生誤解，惟現已因各種解釋混淆難辨。在極權制度之下，思想自由全無存在可能，凡擬自由思想者，非受統制，即立遭淸算。</p>
<p>民主政府不僅爲民亨而且爲民治之政府。本此民主　義，人民宜不斷以開明輿論監督政府，防止官吏亂用職權。因此，即須有言論出版之自由，及自由採訪或公正報導新聞之自由。在極權制度之工，此類自由均不能存在。反之，新聞則變爲科學化之宣傳工具，籍無限　之謾　與不顧偵　之重述，以伸張煤效力。</p>
<p>今日中國所面臨之危險，必由所有大公無私之公民共同努力方可克服。爲此即當有遠大眼光，勇敢與決心。吾人希望中國忠於自由之愛國份子，與全國各界，共同本建設而漸進之步驟，促成整個國家統一與和平進步。</p>

<h3 id="c23">美援與自助 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>舉世矚目的美國援華計劃、終於本月十八日，由杜魯門總統向國會提出了。這個長及千字的總統咨文，不論對中美邦交而言，或對遠東和平而論，都是一種具有歷史性的文件。我們把咨文的全文翻覆誦讀，並綜合全篇大意，有下列各點：（一）强調中美兩國間的眞誠友誼，並對於中國歷年所遭受之困難及考騐，表示同情：（二）要求國會核准五億七千萬　元，作爲一九四九年六月三十日以前之援華計劃：（三）執行此項援華計劃，中美應簽訂協定，將附有各種條件：（四）美國若認爲其所　供之援助未能依照協定辦理，或美國認爲中國政府之政策與美國利用援助以助其完成經濟自給自足之目的不符時，則美國自當保留其停止援助之權利：（五）美國援華計劃，雖爲美國在目前所能採取之最佳途徑，但中國　興仍須全賴本身的自助。</p>
<p>我們看了杜魯門總統的咨文，第一個感想，就是美國的對華政策，不論是民主黨也好，共和黨也好，不論是故羅斯福總統也好，現在的杜魯門總統也好，甚至未來的民主黨總統也好，在原則上終是一貫的，充其量只有輕重和緩急之分而已。在杜魯門總統提出這個援華計劃之前，大家看到美國的援華口惠而實不至，終不免感到失望，因此有許多對於美國一知半解的人，對於杜魯門總統及馬歇　　務卿，揣測紛紛，不是說美國的外交政策「先默後亞」，就是說美國在遠東旨存扶持日本以反蘇。現在我們看到杜魯門總統的咨文，就可以完全明白了。杜魯門　統不僅十二分萬的珍惜中美問眞誠的友誼，而且深切同情我國近年來不幸的遭遇。同時更認識中國的偉大性，匪特地大人衆，抑且文化悠久，已成爲國際關係上一種重要的因素，中國的安定强大與進步，對於太平洋以及全世界的安全與和平，有莫大的關係。杜魯門總統對於中國的認識，實可代表美國朝野共同一致的見解，使我們更加相信，不問今年普選的結果如何？卽使杜稱門總統競選失敗，而由他黨的領袖爲白宮的主人，美國的援華政策，是決不會變更的。所以我們對於杜魯門總統的這一番好意，是不能不首先表示感激的，論理是不能再有所不滿的了。</p>
<p>但是我們如若拋開了理論，而談一談這個計劃的實際功效：則我們對於杜魯門總統的援華計劃能否奏效而達到他預定的目標？不得不表示相當的懷疑。因爲杜魯門總統中張在八年之內撥款五億七千萬美元援助中國，其目的在使中國政府於經濟衰落中獲得喘息的時間，俾能設法建立一較爲穩定之經濟情形。但是我們研究一下美國援華計劃的內容及其程序，再看一看中國的實際情形，我們雖然不是失敗主義者，但是終不相信五億七千萬美元有如　威力。何况以份量來說，援華的數額，只有五萬七千萬美」元，卽　能迅速獲得國會通過，還要至七月一日以後，中國才能獲得切實的援助，而且還要經過一年的時間，才能取得五億七千萬美元的全數。以中國需要的迫切而論，美國援華計劃，不僅不够充分，而且在時問上也不免失之太晚。其功效如何？實在不敢輕下斷語。</p>
<p>以中國目前的情形而論，經濟的困難，固然是中國當前最嚴重的問題，杜魯門總統在咨文中也說：「中國政府及人民現仍受內戰及經濟急劇衰落之雙重壓迫。在過去八年抗戰中由於日本的佔領與封銷而造成的艱難情形，今復因內爭而益趨嚴重，共軍對主要交通之繼續阻攔及破壞，更加深抗戰時期運輸及生產設備業已蒙受之損失。」但是我們仍不能不正吿杜魯門總統及美國朝野，中國目前的問題，不僅僅　經濟問題，而軍事的政治的問題，正與經濟問題互爲因果，如若不明個中的道理，而欲頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，終不是良醫治病之道。杜魯門總統也說：『中國經濟之繼續衰落，美國實極關切；吾人希望中國之環境能使美國援助得以有效，並得以具有建設性之方法，用於建設及復興方面，吾人可能協助中國减輕目前之經濟衰落，俾使中國政府獲得另一機會，開　建立較爲穩定經濟環境之必要步驟。」美國援華若以此爲限，不再採取其他步驟，則必使社魯門總統大失所望，所以共和黨議員以杜魯門總統的援華計劃，未包括軍事援華在內，也一致指實此項計劃爲「不充分」。例如參議院撥款委員會主席白里奇所說：『中國戰後之困難，已超過經濟援助所能挽回大局之範圍。」</p>
<p>惟美國是一個民主的國家，一切內政外交的方針，均須視民意爲依歸，杜魯門總統的援華計劃，尙待國會討論，議員若有意見，不僅均可自由發表，而且還可以修正及補允。何况杜魯門總統所指定的數額五億七千萬美元，也是暫定之數，可以隨時增加。我們希望美國國會議員諸君，認淸中國局勢的嚴重性，隨時督促政府加緊進行援華的工作，尤其要協助中國改革幣制。</p>
<p>最後，我們還得要向中國政府說幾句話，杜魯門總統的援華計劃業巳提出，從日前華府的政治氛圍看來，必能獲得參衆兩院的通過，殆無疑義，援華的數額只有增加不會减少，也可以斷言的。我們對於美國的不斷援助，固然要知道感激，但是最重要的，還是不要忘了「自助」基本國策：千萬不能再存有絲毫依賴外援的心理，抗戰時期，姑置不論，單以勝利之後而論，美國的援助源源血來，不可謂不多，但均未能利用這寳貴的援助，作爲建國復興的起點，實在是我國的一‘大失策，以致使我們的友邦失望，以致令外人批評我們貪汚無能。往者不諫來者可追，我們要一改過去的政風，厲精圖治，自力更生，好好利用這可寳貴的美援，不論是物資或是美元，都要把它完全用於我國經濟的復興，雖一絲一毫，也不可浪費。須知唯有「自助」始能使美援有效！</p>
<h3 id="c24">美援華議內容 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>（上接一版）第四節　A總統可按第三節中所規定之形式或程序，供應對華援助，而不要求償付，或則根據B項中規定之程序而作貸款。全國國際貨幣及金融問題類問委員會，將於總統決定此等援助之是否無需償付或係貸款方式，並決定此等貸款之期限時，作爲總統之顧問。對於爲達成此項法案之目標而給予中國之任何援助，其是否應需要中國償付，是否按照金錢或其他代價償付，以及果有此需要，而其條件如何，將視中國在不危及本法案目標之完成下？從事償付之能力，假設決定可以要求中國僅僅償付本法案下援助之一部份，則在可以實施之情形下，應先就第三節A項第（一）段第二小段中所規定之物價，作爲償付。</p>
<p>B當根據本法案之規定，決定以貸款之方式給予援助之時，總統將以供給此項目的使用之基金，撥付予華盛頓進出口銀行。該行可不受一九四五年修正之進出口銀行法（法令五十九卷五百廿九頁）各規定之約束，應根據總統之指導以及規定之條件，放出貨款並加以管理。進出口銀行爲辦埋此等貸款而在行政上所必需之費用，可以獲得補償。該行應將因償付此等貸款之本息而收到之各項零星數目，存放於美國國　。。</p>
<p>華盛頓進出口銀行以總統撥付　該行之基金而放出之貸款，於根據一九四五年修正之進出口銀行法（法令五十九卷五百廿九頁）第七節，決定該行在任何一個時期其主要之貸款與保證金是否已達規定限制時，不應佔計在內。</p>
<p>第五節　在根據本法案之權力使任何援助可由中國獲得之前，中美之間應成立一項協定，受本法案各項限制與規定之約束，其中中國應提供實現本法案各項目的，並改善對華商業關係之保蹬，以及總統可能認爲需要之其他保證。</p>
<p>A有效利用在本法案授權下之任何物資，並規定此等物資之分　，其定價與條件，以促進本法案之目標爲原則。</p>
<p>B在可能範圍內發動財政，貨幣，預算及行政之措施，以便造　更穩定之幣制情形，並提高中國完成自立經濟之能力。</p>
<p>C當任何物資或服務經由本法案所擾袱之任何方法而非根據付款之條件提供中國之時，以相等數“之中國法幣，在中美兩國政府所同意之條件下，列入一特別賬目內。此項特別賬目，連同中國迤照救濟各戰事受患國人民之恥合決議案第六節（第八十屆國　公共法八十四）所提存款中宋動用之部份，必須留作中美兩國政府所同意之目標之用，而在一九四九年六月卅日此項眼戶上所留之餘數，須在中國使用，其用途由中美兩國政府同意，而經本法案或聯合決議批准。</p>
<p>D在協定日期以後，至少每一季須發表中國政府在該協定下一切行動之全部淸單，包括在本法案下所得基金，物資與服務之用途，並將此項淸單轉交美國。</p>
<p>E經美國請求時，迅速提供有關之報道，以便協助美國確定本法案下未來行動之性質與範圍。</p>
<p>R利用中國境內一切媒介（包括政府無綫電），不斷發表報吿，務使最後之消費人獲悉本法案授權下一切物資之用途，來源，性質及數量。</p>
<p>G在本法案授權下所提供之物資，非經美國政府同意，不予輸出，或准許由中國搬運。</p>
<p>H竭力謀取當地產品最高限度之生產與分配，本法案下所包括之物資，其性質足以减少當地產品之供應，或足以减少除美國以外其他各國供應之來源者，不准採取發售，分配或運用之措施。</p>

<p>J在可以互相同意之時間內，根據合理之條件，便利物資售予美國，以供積存之用。此項物資，乃因美國本身資源缺乏或可能缺乏而需要者，同時，此等物資亦係在對中國爲國內用途以及商業輸出之合理需求作適當之估計後，尙可在中國獲得者。（未完）</p>

<p>吳氏首謂，該報以國民黨過去廿年中的一黨執政，誤認爲與共產黨的階級專政一樣，顯然忽視了國民黨創造者係中山博士的主張和努力，</p>
<p>吳氏又謂，在過去廿年中，雖有共黨叛亂與日本侵略，但國民黨在內憂外患中，從未放鬆過對實施民主政治的準備工作，戰前在南京已有國大會堂的建築，戰時在重慶也曾建築國民大會塲所，則此一端，已足證明國民黨是決不以一黨專政爲革侖的。而共黨則不願參加國大，反對憲法，絕不容許反對黨存在。</p>
<p>吳氏最後又指出，泰晤士報於上星期三曾經刋載北平特派員的報導，其記述中國共產黨的暴政謂「共產黨唯在於以一黨的階級專政來統制全人民的生活，甚且及於人民之家庭私生活。」這種實際觀察的報導，倒是共產黨與國民黨不相同所在的絕好說明。</p>

<p>空軍虎將：高又新之死</p>
<p>二月十三日下午三時卅五分，「顆巨星隕落在南京五虎橋以東的鐵軌上，——一位轟轟烈烈的空中英雄，無聲無息地在火車的輪盤之下想滅了生侖之火花！</p>
<p>這是高又新的悲劇。在空軍中，高又新是代表令人尊敬的名詞。今年才卅二歲。自十九歲那年獻身空軍起，他一直是空軍的驕子。他崇拜高志航，亦被人稱爲「小高志航」。他勇敢，聽敏，熱情而爽直。在八年抗戰中，他造成中國空軍史上最光輝的紀錄：親手擊毁敵機百餘架，建功達二百七十五次，獲勛罩十五枚之多。堪稱一員虎將！勝利後他沒有休患，繼續替祖國掃蕩妖氛。他不死在對敵人賊子作戰的空中，他死得不得其所，好不可惜</p>
<p>高又新生在遼密省錦縣一個中等的家　裏。早歲喪父，由寡母及叔父高永恩撫養成人。母親是虔誠的基督敎徒，耶穌博愛的精神，薰陶着少年時代的他。當民國廿四年，古北口發生戰事，平津感受威脅，他在天津扶輪中學剛剛畢業，便立志投入空軍，認爲空軍是報國的最好門徑。那時他只有十九歲，因爲在學校時愛好體育，身體非常强壯。那年七月一日，空軍軍官學校在天津招考第八期學員，他一老便取了。九月一日在南京入伍受訓。到廿五年八月，在廣州分校受初級飛行訓練。廿六年四月間在杭州筧橋受　級飛行訓練。是年八一三，滬戰爆發，筧橋航校先遷江西南昌，再遷湖北孝感，又遷廣　柳州，於十一月間到昆明，受高級飛行訓練。他駕駛的是驅逐機，）面受訓，一面服務。廿七年九月廿四日，日橋首次轟炸昆明，他尙未畢業，就　了霍克3驅逐機升空迎敵，表現出色，一鳴驚人。</p>
<p>廿七年十二月一日，正式在航校畢業，調至蘭州驅逐總隊受訓。廿八年分發至重慶，在第四大隊當少尉隊員。第四大隊是高志航一手創辦的，又稱「志航大隊」。英雄主義巴彩極爲濃厚的高又新常對人吐　抱負：「要做高志航第二—」</p>
<p>他無負於他的志向。後來的事實證明他做到和高志航一樣的偉大；而總結又新一生的戰績，還超過了志航。他每次作戰總是勇往直前，使敵方爲之胆寒。廿九年他升任第四大隊第廿一中隊的中尉分隊長，在蘭州担任防務。某次，敵機大舉來襲，他駕駛俄式E15—3　逐機迎頭痛擊，擊落敵機三架之多，建立殊勛。高又新三個字乃爲全國人士所熟悉。</p>
<p>卅年積功而升任第廿一中隊上尉副中隊長，由蘭州回至重慶，參加保衛大重慶之戰。是年三月一日，敵人開始用零式驅逐機作戰，較我國使用的E15與E16式性能爲優。故那個時候，是我空軍最居劣勢的時候。高又新曾在某次空戰中負了傷。</p>
<p>到卅一年，第四大隊去昆明，並去印度接受美國訓練，使用最新式之P-40型驅逐　，轉劣　爲優勢，將敵人之　式觀　迫得不敢露面。這時，富又新已是第四大隊第廿二中隊的中隊長，與陳納德領導的美國第十四航空隊併肩作戰，屢予黄河南北敵軍以重創。</p>
<p>高又新於卅二年升爲第四大隊少校副大隊長。某次，駕機轟炸河南敵軍，曾爲敵軍砲火擊中而跳傘一次，不幸跳在共軍區城內，那時共軍表面上還是「合作」。然而「合作」的情形却是向空軍總司令部提出條件，須以鉅款爲代價始准贖出。他在共軍那裏被軟禁了三個月才回到　慶，</p>
<p>他一生受過三次傷，跳過三次傘。吉人天相，他總是逢凶化吉。</p>
<p>年少而負有盛名，高又新的戀愛生活是至爲破產的。在廿八年的春天，他結識了一位西南聯大的高材生劉默然小姐。劉小姐在聯大被尊爲「皇后」　。英雄美人，一見傾心。卅一年夏天，在成都勵志社舉行婚　，嘉賓去集，多少人爲他們　一對欣羨—然而造物者善妒，在新婚二個多月以後，新娘得了結核性腦膜炎不治而逝。新郞哀痛之餘，絕跡娛樂塲所，把他如火的熱情全部寄託於工作方面。在卅四年勝利前夕，美國發明了速度更快的P-15型驅逐機，用以掃蕩大江南北在動搖中的敵軍，所向披靡。是爲我空軍最盛時代。</p>
<p>勝利了！舉國歡騰。高又新迎着勝利的光輝，在重慶舉行第二次婚禮。對方是何玲玲小姐，一位十七歲的湖南少女，是中委何鍵的孫女兒。未幾，第四大隊由渝移防北平，新夫婦同遊故都。是年冬，共匪賀龍部大舉攻擊綏包，高又新空中作戰，再建奇勛。由於他作戰驍勇，當卅五年春，東北共匪大舉進攻的時候，東北亦需耍他。他遂由平而去　陽。這一次，高太太未同行，而悲劇竟在那裏種下了根苗！</p>

<p>〔路透社成功湖十八日電〕英殖民部大臣瓊斯本日在此向記者發表談話，預料英國於五月十五結束巴勒斯坦之委治後，聖地之動亂必將愈趨惡劣。彼時阿拉伯人必將更公開地使用武力，以反抗分治。瓊斯並曰，巴勒斯坦苟無英安全軍駐在，普遍的內戰當早已爆發。英國以公正之立塲，竭力避免猶阿兩族之衝突。英國對於聯合國向其提出之要求，未能一一接受，實綠本身必須處理　出聖地的重大任務之故。英國不能接受聯合國機構要求之最主要兩點，即猶太移民港口之開放及聯合國委會抵達聖地之日期，英國深知移民港口之開放必致引起更嚴重的內戰。被詢及英國是否接受需要國際軍以執行分治之原則之問題時，瓊斯答曰，余於去年十月間即已警吿聯合國機構以阿拉伯之將反對分治，故使用武力以執行分治，具有極大之需要，故若聯合國機構有執行其決議的決心，必須給予適當的武力配備，此事今當由安理會爲之決定。</p>

<p>〔路透社普拉格十八日電〕捷克波蘭南斯拉夫三國外長在普拉格舉行兩日會議後發表宣言，抗議在德國西部的片面解決游法，並稱西德爲特殊的政治單位，破壤歐洲安全的基礎。宣言並聲明分裂德國與其鄰邦不利，亦有損德國之和平進展。宣言復抗議馬歇爾方案之給予德國以復興之優先權，要求履行捷彼南三國之賠償要求，並鄭重提出警吿，謂德國已自紊亂的中心，變爲侵略的新工具。三國外長並決定繼續交換關於德國問題之情報及意見。</p>
<p>宣言全文長二千字，謂三國對於關於德國之一切問題，意見完全一致。德國局勢之發展，已與波茨坦及雅爾達規定的原則相背，德國之認識此項原則，乃爲獲致歐洲和平的必要條件。歐洲之裂成兩　對立集團，使西德成爲一强政策　工具，並鼓勵改頭換面後的德國國家主義及　武主義的復活，此等現象可能爲首先進攻捷波南，最後復進攻整個歐洲的淵源。捷波南三國政府鄭重抗議違背盟國義務及未經外長會議批准行動，要求充分履行波茨坦雅爾達協定中關於强國應就在德職權之行使與其他盟國交換意見之規定。三國政府雖承認恢復德國正常經濟之重要性，但對最　復興西歐足以危害西歐承平時代經濟之計劃，則深爲關切。予德國復興以優先權，有悖　等及公理原則，其意乃在建立具有龐大軍備實力之西德國家。宣言繼曰，最近减低之捷南賠償計劃，殊不足以補償兩國受德侵略之損失。捷波南乃首先遭希特勒侵略之被害國，解決德國問題之際，決不可有損歐洲國家最主要的利益，不然，將使德國自紊亂的中心，成爲侵酪的新工具。三國政府深知大戰期間盟國之合作，承認蘇聯捷克波蘭南斯拉夫在大戰中之貢獻，尊重四强共管德國，並與捷波南徵求意見，乃歐洲特久和平及安全的確切保證。宣言此外並要求懲處戰犯，及制止返德德人所從事的妨碍和平之宣傳。捷外長馬薩里克，波外長莫合李夫斯基，南外長西密樞，聯合舉行記者招待會，宣讀前述宣言。馬蕯里克並曰三國政府將以此會結果，非正式知照西方三强。</p>

<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>戰神之刀已掛在我們頭上</p>
<p>我們旣然不能期望近衛內閣有良好的表現，我們對于十月十七日以後成立的東條內閣，當然更不能期望些什麽。東條曾任陸相。在就任首相之後，依然繼續是一個現役陸軍軍官。他是一個典型的日本軍官，他的思相狹窄刻板而不會變通。他很頑固，一相情願（愚蠢的），硬幹，而具有相當的動力。</p>
<p>新任日本外相東鄉是一個典型的日本外務省的官員。在他的行業內，他是一個良好的技術人員，但是他的見解相當狹小而且不能獲得廣泛的觀察。</p>
<p>同時，我開始注意到東條對我們談話態度的迫切意念。近衛曾促使我們迅速接受他的條件，但是他的目標之一是想借助我們與他的協議，而繼續留于其職守。東條也是要迅速行事，可是他的目標却與近衛不同，我以爲：假使不能協議，他就準備行動，也就是促成戰爭。</p>
<p>這種緊迫的意念，幾乎是一種瘋狂的行動，企贓迫使我們成立協議，把東京所想要的全部給它；這一緊迫的意念一直繼續至珍珠港事件爆發。在東條握權後的數天，我們就發覺了這種意念。在那時候，有一封十月二十一日給野村的電文爲我們截獲，譯文送達我的辦公桌，內容略稱：「就發表意見和頤明我們的立塲而言，凡是可以講的，我國幾乎都已說過了。我們覺得我們已經到達了一種程度，那就是說除了要求美國重新考慮其見解外，我們不能再有進一步的積極行動。因此，我們要求在一個適當的時候，你或是若山（日大使館參議）應該　接向美國說明我國不能再化費時間從事討論這些問題」。</p>
<p>東條政府的緊迫意念，繼續增高。十一月三日，外相東鄉訓令前任駐德大使來栖到華盛頓來，顯明是要協助野村與我談判。我們依照日本政府的請求，立即採取各種可能的步驟，加　他横渡太平洋的飛行。</p>
<p>同日，格魯大使把他的意見打一電報給我。他以爲假使我們的談判失敗，日本或者會來一次不成功即滅亡的切腹行爲。</p>
<p>在截獲的電文中，我們已第一次發現了限期。東鄉在他十一月五日致野村的電文中稱：「由于各種環境，所有本協定簽署的　置，應于本月二十五日前完成，這是絕對需要的。我知道這是一個困難的命令。但是在目前環境下，這是一個不可避免的命令。請你澈底了解這一點，從事防止日美關係陷于混亂的情形中」。</p>
<p>就我們看來：這衹有一種解釋。日本已經撥動她戰爭機器的輪子，而且如果在十一月二十五日前我們不接受她的要求，日本決定不惜一戰。</p>
<p>因此，在十一月七日美內閣當會中，我對當前的危機，提出嚴厲的警吿。在這憂　的會議中，遠東的局勢，佔據了我們全部的腦海。照例，總統在內閣會議開始時，首先由本人檢討局勢，然後再向內閣適當人員徵詢意見或是請求閣員提出其估計。但是這一次他直接問我是否有什麼要提出討論。</p>
<p>我請了約有十五分鐘，指出整個國際局勢的危機。我並且詳述我們與日方談判的　進。</p>
<p>我作結論稱：「在我看來，關係已經是極端　危急。我們應該注視日本隨時隨地作軍事的進攻」。</p>
<p>沉靜了一會，然後總統走了一圈，徵詢每一閣員的意見。他們全都同意我對危機的估計。</p>
<p>內閣一致同意：認爲危險的局勢應由高級官員在演詞中予以強調，以便全國人民都能够爲這一發展準備一切。在以後的數天內，總統，海長諾克斯與副國務卿韋爾斯都就此問題發表有力的演說。</p>
<p>野村雖然繼續為日本　和平意向喋喋不休，但是送到找辦公桌的截獲電報却另有文章。電報之一，日期爲十一月十四日，是從東京打給日本駐滬代表的，裏面說明假使我們的談判不能產生協議，中國方面可能發生的是什麽。電文稱：「我們將完全摧毁英美在中國的力量。我們將接收敵人在華的租界及權益（海關與礦藏）。</p>
<p>十一月十五日，來栖到達華盛頓，十一月十七日，野村陪同來栖來到我的辦公室。在我看來，來栖似乎是野村的反面。無論是他的外額或是他的態度，都不能令人信任或是尊敬他。一起首，我就覺得他很是奸詐，我們截獲的電報，我們經常得到的情報，以及在我們以勒的談話中對日方態度的分析，從這一些裏面，我們已知道了日本的意向。因此，假使說來栖在　開日本時還是不知道日政府的計劃和他所負的任務，這似乎是不可能的。他被派到華盛頓的目的是在兩者之間選擇一種：一抓方法是要使用各種可能的壓力與引誘，迫使我們接受日本的條件，另一方法是在這方面失敗後利用談判使我們鬆懈直至日本準備完成而開始進擊。</p>
<p>野村在介紹來栖給我的時候，同時以日政府的聲明一件交給我。我們曾請求東條內閣證實近衛內閣所已同意的各點。日政府此一聲明接受了我們的請求。</p>
<p>略談之後，我陪同兩位使節穿過街道到達對面的白宮，與總統會談。局勢不能再比這時候緊急的了。衹在前一天，野村接獲東條的來電，證實了十一月二十五日的限期。我們也截獲了這一封電報。</p>
<p>電文云：「依閣下之見，我們應該忍耐等着看戰局的轉變。但是我很抱歉的說：目前局勢已使我們無法辦到。爲了結算這種談判，我已提出限期，不能有所變更。請你了解這一點。你也知道時間是怎樣的短促；因此，不要容許美國轉移我們的注意而繼續拖延談判。迫使他們依照我們的建議謀得解決。爲促成立即解決，請儘最大的努力。」</p>
<p>事情已變成了這種情形，那就是我們必須在日方指定的文件上簽字，否則就得接受一切後果。</p>
<p>不論是在那一次白宮會談，或是在以後三天內野村，來栖與我討論中，日本新任使節都沒有提出新的建議。</p>
<p>從東京發出被我們截獲的電報，已經毫無疑問的證明危機已迫眉睫。野村已接到訓令，撤退在美國的日僑，他又接到一種新的電報密碼，方法是這樣的：他可聽取日本的短波新聞播音，注意裏面關於風向的報告，從這裏，他可以知道日本是否將對美，蘇或英斷絕外交關係。電報又吿訴他在聽到此一報吿後，燬滅所有電碼，秘密文件等。</p>
<p>然後在十一月二十日—感恩節—，野村與來梄給我一套新的建議，就表面看，這些建議是很極端的。截獲的日方電報吿訴我們，這是日本最後的建議。這是一個哀的美敦書。</p>
<p>日本的建議，雖然其性質是如此的荒謬，任何美方負責官員都不能夢想到予以接受，但是我覺得我的反應不該過份激烈，藉以避免給予日方以中斷談判的藉口。</p>
<p>十一月二十一日，來栖單獨來看我。我間來栖他本人或是野村對於整個和平解決問題是否還有什麼建議提出。他回答說沒有。</p>
<p>在來栖這次訪問本人並聲明對於這一問題已無進一步的提議之後，我在與華盛頓當局及個人談話時，（其中包括史丹克上將），加倍警吿他們，指出日本或將隨時道單。</p>
<p>外交上講，局勢可以說是等於絕望，但是在我們一方面，我們是要竭盡一切方法去尋求一個和平的解決，以便避免或是延阻戰爭。陸軍部長史汀生，海長諾克斯，參謀總長馬歇雨以及海軍作戰部長史丹克，都是我經常接　的人物，他們都要求更多的時間，準傳美國的抵抗。一方面，日本要求與我們攤牌。我們爲了我們的原則屹立不動。日方也不退讓，對於他們的要求，極　威迫的能事。</p>
<p>十一月二十一日與二十二日，我們準備提出反建議，我們草就了一個臨時協定，在這協定上，將附有永久協定的大綱。</p>
<p>我們努力草擬一個包括十大要點的和平協定大綱，附在臨時協定上。大槪的說，我的同事與我爲了挽救危局，都已到達了山窮水盡的階段。</p>
<p>財長摩根韜在他的部內草擬了一個解決方案，送給本人。這雖然是財長越俎代謀，企圖担任第二國務卿工作的另又一例子，但是其中有若干點是很好的，因此也併入了我們最後的的草案。</p>
<p>由我們截獲東京致野村與來栖的十一月二十二日電文，已把限期從十一月二十五日展延到二十九日。逾限就是戰爭。電文云：「堅特我們的旣定政策，盡你們最大的能力。爲促成我們所需要的解決，你們應該不遺餘力的工作。我們爲什麽要在二十五日之前，解決美日關係，這裏面有許多原因是你能力所想像不到的，但是在未來三四天內，假使你能够與美方完成談判，假使簽署能於二十九日前究成（讓我寫一遍—二十九日）假使能够交換通電的照會，假使我們獲得英荷兩國的諒解，簡單的說，假使各種事情都能完成，那末，我們就決定等到那一天。這一次我們說得到就做得到。限期絕對不能更變。在此以後，事情將自動的發生。」</p>
<p>「在此以後，事情將自動的發生」，在這一句話的陰影下，我們在以後的兩星期中拚命的苦幹，企圖爭取和平，或者最低限度是更多的時間。</p>
<p>在我與英·中·澳·荷使節（時爲十一月二十二日）晤談歡小時以後，野村與來栖到我的寓所來看我。看到這些日本代表笑容可掬，彬彬有禮和外觀非常友好的來到我家中，幾乎是一種夢幻的環境。我旣然從截獲的電文中知道了日本的惡毒計劃，而又明白來栖與野村也知道了同樣的情報，所以在我用同樣的語調和同樣的態度和他們談話時，就是一種痛苦。他們坐在那裏，鞠躬如也，野村有時候作吃吃笑，來栖也露齒而笑；但是在他們的腦海中却充滿了一種想法，他們以爲：假使我們不對日本的要，求說一聲「耶斯」—（是）他們的政府在數天內就會發動新侵略，遲早與美國交戰。</p>
<p>十一月二十四日，我們截獲東條給野村的電報，裏面說前次所提出的限期是十一月二十九日東京時間。因此戰神的刀劍已掛在我們的頭上，在預定時間到達後，即將爆發。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕竄　松青一帶之共匪丁錫山部，自在浦南登陸以來，經各方五日間之圍剿，業已全部殲滅。十八日靑浦尤浜區戰門，國軍及地方團隊在靑年軍第五團高團長，及副團長邢祖援，營長張樹　，靑浦縣長劉勁等聯合指揮下，發揮最大威力，使奸匪欲在江南成立司令部威脅蘇浙一帶治安之企圖，一舉撲滅。匪言丁錫山證明確已格斃。是役戰果，計鹵獲湯姆生七支，卡平一支，輕機槍四挺，擲彈筒三門，步槍十四支，快慢機一支，手榴彈一二五枚，刺刀十把，彈夾（連實彈）十只。該項武器極爲精良，現均暫存靑浦縣政府內。此外俘獲匪軍高級幹部「江南人民解放軍縱隊副司令」湯景延（化名張王），秘書周永興，宣傳科長郁金祖，管理科長吳建，戰鬥排長係春岳，及班長張可同，錢覺民，衛生員周直民，通訊員吳海，機槍手周永康，羅小丙，彈擊手金銀滿，張金榮，伙伕潘偉朝，及士兵許和香，謝國鉅，陳學曾，馬阿鳥，張友才，胡來興，羅阿大，施興發，沈時俊，孫阿早，余子德，潘先法，陳才美，胡銀才，張金，陸明寳，王開華，楊阿卜，章阿康，陸東田，楊仲黃，林明童，蔡平，李志康，常子成，蔣福全，董長根等計四十二人。渠等均爲江浙籍，惟均係在蘇北匪區受訓後派來者，現悉禁押於靑浦警察局內，日內將先作初步偵訊，再俟當局指示處理辦法。至有功部隊，將由軍事當局報請核獎。</p>

<p>在戰役中當塲格斃之十三具匪屍昨已運靑，匪首丁錫山之遺屍亦在內，平頭，着長袍及絲棉衫褲，其身畔並藏有牙質圖章一枚，鐫「丁錫山」三字，（見圖）按浦南一帶均熟知丁匪生前姓名慣用「山」字，但據俘獲之匪軍稱，丁在匪區則均用「三」字。丁匪之首級，於昨上午十一時四十五分，懸掛靑浦艮成門頭示衆後，靑屬崧澤村有一沈姓靑年，因在敵僞時期曾受丁拘捕陷害，聞訊特趕來觀看，見後鼓掌稱快，並謂確係丁匪無疑。首級至下午四時十分取下，與屍體重行縫合。丁匪係口部中彈致死，據當時目擊之國軍及俘獲之匪談：匪因受圍剿，丁即與湯景延分爲兩處，各率一部匪軍據墳墓頑抗，嗣因包圍圈縮小至一百公尺以內，目標由迫近而暴露，國軍二營第四迎狙擊手上等兵徐登舫，泅水越一小河，抄出丁匪一部據點背後，發槍射擊，當即命中丁匪。至丁匪及俘獲之匪軍幹部，均身穿便服，聞係渠等在受大包圍後已預知失敗，故多換借鄉農粗服，準備竄逸者。</p>

<p>此次丁匪率部在奉賢分批登陸，目的並非僅在竄擾松靑，而係企圖號召舊部，在靑浦重固觀音堂老巢建立「江南人民解放軍司令部」，再徐圖擴展，進謀威脅京滬治安，渠等預定此項計劃如遭遇阻碍，或無法存身，即擬轉移澱山湖或太湖，或分赴浙東一帶，終期實現計劃而後止。但不料登陸後即遭奉賢一五二旅部尾隨追擊，又受各方部隊夾擊，一網打盡。據俘獲之「副司令」湯景延稱：渠等離蘇北時，武裝配備齊全，惟登陸遭受追擊後，途中即陸續逃亡走散甚多，故武器已有一部失散，至殘匪則多係共匪老幹部，出發前由蘇北各匪區挑選組成者，戰鬥力頗高，故遭遇戰能維持數小時以上。昨靑年軍高團長。邢副團長及劉縣長等對渠等進行偵訊時，該批俘匪猶執迷不悟，於此亦可見彼等中毒之深。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕盤據浦江南北十載，反復無常，忽而爲抗日英雄，忽而爲叛國漢奸，最後又投共匪之丁錫山，係奉賢莊行鄔家橋人，父業農。弟兄四人，長名品山·次名金山·四名義山·錫山行三，故又名錫三。未受敎育，自幼即兇横成性，及成年不務正業，遊手好閒，專事結交地痞流氓，後加入綁票匪團，於民國二十年因案發被捕繫獄。二十六年抗戰軍興，敵陷滬市，丁趁亂越獄與同獄李啓蒙等十餘人結爲異姓弟兄，潛伏浦南鄉間活動，自稱遊擊司令。二十七年春初，人槍積至數百，與我政府當局發生關係，被委爲蘇浙行動委員會忠義救國軍第三支隊。是年七月，復改編爲第八支隊，忠救軍總部特派專員何行健駐丁部指導。其時日軍對之亦頗注意，時派部隊園攻。嗣指導員何行健受誘附敵，丁乃於廿八年九月間</p>
<p>投僞。所部千餘人，均被改編為「和平救國軍十二路軍」，何任司令，丁副之。嗣後何逆被總部派員正法，丁遂自任為司令。其時設總部於上海大西路，專事綁架富商巨賈，勒索鉅款，用以擴充部隊。至廿九年夏末改編為僞十三師，自任師長，其勢力遍及松江·奉賢·寳山·青浦·吳江·平湖·川沙·南匯等十餘縣。其全盛時期所部共四旅，可二萬人。因囂張過甚，遭敵忌，且與葉逆　不洽，被關　浙東。日軍對之監視甚　，丁　能暢所欲爲，深爲苦痛，且其實力亦漸削弱，遂思</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市府爲商討本市房租標準問題，昨在市府召集各有關機關團體代表會議，到四十餘人。祝局長主席。席間各代表熟烈交換意見，多反對房租按照生活指數計算。潘議長爲市民呼籲，房租必須加以限制。渠稱：房租標準必須擬訂，惟依照生活指數計算，則甚不合理。因本市之多數工人及商店職員，其收　皆不按照生活指數，勢必不勝負担。房屋租賃條例中規定，政府有權指定房租最高額，希望市府履行。</p>
<p>昨日會議因係討論交換性質，故無　體之決定，惟祝局長會保證決不因此加重市民負担，歸納各代表意見：（一）本市房租確有規定之必要，惟房租標準，不應按照生活指數計算。應硏討決定一較合理之根據，作爲房租之底數。所謂合理根據分爲二種：甲·以本市目前實際房租之平均數作爲根據。乙·根據工人及職員生活指數平均數酌打折扣。（二）房租基數之調整，可能考慮三個月一次。（三）公敎人員房租標準，根據前三個月之職員及工人純房租指數之平均數訂定之，新聞界及文化界亦予以同樣優待。（四）營業用房屋租金標準可略高，不加以硬性限制。祝局長表示：地政局將參考上列各方面供獻之意見，漏夜擬訂房租最高額，提請今日市政會議通過後，再送參會第五次大會作最後核定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕江蘇省三區專員兼保安司令謝承炳，副司令朱長忠，昨日上午已由靑浦回松，記者往訪，兩氏以興奮愉快之語調稱：「上海新聞界連日報導確實匪情，排除流言，安定民心，對此次殲匪，幫助良多」。記者亦向其賀功並詢其善後處置及對此次丁匪來犯之感想。謝專員談稱：丁錫山在浦南一帶舊部之衆多，潛勢力之厚，為衆所週知，自丁投匪後，我方即過慮及此，尤以三區所屬各縣均與上海市接壤，三區治安能確保，上海市始能安定，現來犯之丁匪部全部殲滅，足證三區警衛力量之雄厚，民衆自衛組織之嚴密。更因此事件，今後我江南軍民應有所警惕，至於因此次追剿丁匪及毁於砲火之農村損失，即將開始調査，政府準備救濟或賠償。最後並以極樂觀之口吻稱：預料三個月以內，共匪決不敢再在三區海濱侵擾，丁匪之舊勢力亦將無形消滅。朱副司令對此次殲匪軍事佈置亦闡述甚詳，據謂：十二日黄昏匪登陸後一小時，保安司令部即接獲錢家橋鎭望海鄉電話報吿，司令部得此警報，首先以電話致松江縣政府，第二個電話致奉賢縣縣政府時，電話綫即被剪斷，浦南各縣鄉電話亦俱不通，足證丁匪在登陸前早有佈置，但翌日各路電綫立即修復，國軍，保安隊開始追擊，使匪疲於奔命，已無暇旁及其他。至於此次戰術，司令部有三項原則：（一）鄉自衛隊由鄉長率領，負責緊跟匪踪，隨時將匪之行踪利用鄉村電話報吿司令部。（二）縣鎭自衛隊負責防堵。（三）各地保安隊集中主力，兜剿殲匪。此項戰術甚爲成功，自十三日起，匪之行踪，保安司令部始終瞭如指掌，原預定在天馬山地區殲滅之，惟在浦南朱家行與浦北天馬山兩處失却聯絡，後此計劃不能實現，前者斷八小時後者四小時，現該兩處鄉長，已由保安司令部扣押訊究，惟據供，朱家行鄉長因病吿假，遂無人負責，天馬山鄉長於匪竄入天馬山鄉區後，即率部跟隨流匪，遺忘報吿，皆情有可原，將予從輕處罰。至於來犯之匪，除丁匪親率數人外，餘者均係共匪之老幹部，每人均有可任連長之資格，丁匪之企圖，原擬來浦南，糾集舊部，建立新根據地，惟當其登陸後，即經國軍及保安隊到處追擊，使其無喘息機會，國軍一五二旅在最後安莊殲滅一役中，雖不及趕上，然自匪登岸日起，直自奉賢海濱至瀋家角，至烟墩頭，渡浦江，越鐵路，以迄天馬山，始終緊隨匪後追擊，其功績亦不可沒煞也。</p>

<p>— 李漢魂</p>
<p>海軍學校</p>
<p>于短促時間內溫習一次科學與機器發達史，對于英國　業之基本原因，更得進一層之了解。由科學而工業，由工業而商業，由商業而開拓海外市塲，由保護海外市塲而發展海軍，於是英國有海上覇王之英名。雖無充分時間一瞻海上覇王之全貌，但得大使館之預先接洽，由陳武官訓瀅及英國海軍部之連絡官相陪，仍獲參觀其海軍敎育之重要機關—皇家海軍學校，心中甚感愉快。</p>
<p>先到辦公室，承校長說明王家海軍學校發達之歷史。據談，「海校所在地爲五百年前之王宮。一六一〇年新建王后一宮；一六四〇年英王被逐，成立共和政府；一六六〇年復辟；一七〇〇年前後英西戰時，王與后體念海軍將士之辛勞，贈此宮爲海軍醫院，後改爲年老官兵休養院，仍發帑繼續完成其建築。嗣以年老官兵改發養老金，故以此宮爲校址。吾人圍坐之辦公廳，乃當年英王之餐廳。隨引觀室內各種陳設，並就所掛圖表加以說明。室隅有一六八〇年所造之大時鐘，古色蒼蒼，準確依舊。門內客廳，有歷任校長之題名，右室遍懸納爾　時代之海軍高級將領像，甚爲精彩。出觀王及后御用之碼頭，盛跡猶在。</p>
<p>聖保羅圓項式之后宮，乃全校之中心。左右前方，各有偉麗建築。左爲餐應及科學試騐室。餐廳之頂，壁畫極壯麗。正廳上座，繪有英王喬治第二及其三代之行樂圖，費時十九年，酬畫師以六千鎊；且繪有畫師伸手作討錢狀，英人幽默，於此見之。右座爲禮拜堂及參謀學校（上校以上人員之參謀班，非常設也）不及詳觀。校之正班，另設一處，惜未及覽，即矗立后宮左後爲世界標準時間之格林威治天文臺，亦祗望而未即，殊屬遺憾。</p>
<p>循觀校中一週後，相與討論陸海空軍比率改戰後海軍之重要性等問題，雖以範圍太大，未盡其詳，亦藉知英國在此次大戰中兵員之最高額，曾達五百餘萬。自一九四五年九月十八日開始復員，預計至一九四八年三月底止，陸海空軍總數將爲九十三萬七千名；內陸軍五十二萬七千名，空軍二十六萬三千名，海軍十四萬七千名，總額比較戰前約多三倍。並以事實證明，今後海上交通，須由海空協力，乃能切實維持。</p>
<p>時値暑假，復遇週末，未克一聆敎室講授及各種操練，心殊怏快。走馬看花，於古奧中發現生力，文化與武力並陳，過去英國之稱雄海上，其來固有自也。</p>
<p>牛津大學</p>
<p>黄炳君駛車，韓武官濬昌相陪，菊芳檢齊筆記册，直向牛津出發。由市區轉到原野，平疇一片，淸寂安　，怡然自得。旋抵目的地，光訪熊式一先生。熊先生着述宏富，尤以「王寳釧」一劇，馳譽歐美。主人好客，問訊股拳，隨嘱家人備餐，幷以導遊自任。</p>
<p>牛津爲英國著名之大學區，一入其中，各處所見，皆是學校。牛津創辦於一千二百六十餘年，較之劍橋建校尙早廿年。七百年歷史之文化淵藪，綿延不絕，悠深古奧，毋怪英人以此自豪。校中建築，多屬四五百年前舊物，新建者亦力求仿古，故古趣盎然。其式樣，大都中爲大院，繞以房舍，有若北平之莊院。間且包以圍牆，上有雉堞，遙望若碉堡。所有頺磚舊瓦，破板殘扉，莫不力事保存。甚至窗口之積鏖，燈上之蛛網，亦不忍拂去。遊者或崇拜其傳統精神，或議議其保守過甚。雖屬見仁見智，不必強同，然追懷文化　蹟，激發思古幽情，實爲難能可貴。</p>
<p>牛津共有二十五間男校，五間女校。每校有其獨立組織，且各有校長。所謂牛津大學者，實此三十間性質不同內容各別學校之總稱。而統一其考試與學位之授予。各校除各右其飯廳，宿舍」課堂及圖書館外，且各自有其禮拜堂，尖頂林立，有如亂峯聳峙，蔚成大觀，其中以於六百年前由敎堂改爲學校之，一間尤爲偉麗。走入最小一間之禮拜堂，發現十七世紀名家之建築，精美非常。</p>
<p>飯廳上有横桌，爲敎授席。下方直排餐桌，學生相對而坐。食時須着制服。師生不必日日到齊。宿舍每人一間，內有書室，寢室，潔凈室各一，佈置精美。學生可外宿，但須在校居住一定時間。經過相當薰陶之後。課堂設備簡單，坐位甚少，有終年未入課堂者。有一課堂衹坐二三人者。</p>
<p>牛津大學敎授，不重形式，而重精神與人格陶冶。每生須擇導師二人，一任學科，一任品德，學科與品德並重齊觀。有時學生圍集敎授家中，敎授口啣不須臾離之雪茄而一語不發，學生靜坐默思，悠然神往，薰陶亦自在其中。深思遠慮，靜默安閒，有古紳士風，有學者風，自非無素養之小國淺民所可了解。</p>
<p>且走且談，見若干敎授自禮拜堂出，藉以分別科位之紅藍黑三色禮服，紛現於眼廉。學生則着長短不一之制服。複雜中有整齊，混亂中有統一與調和，由師生服裝可以反映出心之所思與學之所好。</p>
<p>參觀詩人雪萊死於沙漠中之裸體白石紀念像；及英國大辭典作者所用寫字檯。又見羅馬佔領時代所築之城堡，事過千年，祗餘故壘，有演古劇者，正在攝入鏡頭。入觀滿裝版籍的岡書館，圍以古石像之學位給授處，與敎授進修之研究院。古色蒼蒼，琳瑯滿目。</p>
<p>最後乘車環遊一古雅市街，精美爲英倫街道之冠。悠閒恬靜，頓增弦歌雅調之思。</p>
<p>車返熊寓，已下午二時許。午餐後，驅車返市，並遊植物公園。園林規模過大，衹擇觀熱帶植物部份。玻璃房滿目皆是。搜羅宏富，設備週到。在苦寒地區，移植熱帶植物，而能欣欣向榮，不能不歎科學人工之偉大。菊芳因習農科，對此尤感興趣。</p>
<p>伊頓學校</p>
<p>如謂牛津與劍橋爲英國最高學府之代表，則伊頓學校（EtonCollege）應爲英國中等敎育之典型，因時間關係，未及一訪劍橋。聞劍橋與牛津規模無大差別，惟未獲親臨領略，終以爲憾。伊頓則極有一訪之價値。承賴武官名湯以軍來接，韓武官濬昌亦欣然樂往，遂與偕遊。</p>
<p>伊頓學校爲有名之貴族學校，乃一四四〇年英王亨利第六所創辦。迄今五百餘年，風光形色，一仍其舊。以言敎室，木柱木壁以及長條桌櫈，俱爲一六〇〇年戰勝西班牙時奪得之木料所造，古色古香，光潤　澤，刀劃推刻，有如亂絲，或爲題名，或爲任意圖寫與我國之「厠所文學」差可比擬。以言禮拜堂，古色斑斑，均爲駕物；其兩壁所懸之畫，乃一四七〇年所有物，尤堪賞玩。其各有一紀念堂，乃以紀念第一次大戰時該校爲國犧牲之一一五七人。全校有宿舍二七座，且附屋甚多，現容學生一一三〇人，深院曲巷，涵詠淵深。校中各種建築若非光綫不充，便爲牆壁遭受塗汚或剝落。大門以內之院地，由碎石碎磚所敷成，高低坎坷，步履維艱，殆欲與牛津大學梯口電燈之蛛網積塵交相輝映耶？保守一至於此，殆欲薰陶生徒，使之緬懷往烈，且激發其思古之幽情耶？</p>
<p>英國學生升學不以資歷而以考試。十一歲可考中學，十八歲（戰時則十七）可考大學，故多延師自敎，不入中小學而及時應考。但貴族子弟，多入伊頓學校，出世即須登記，七歲人學。伊頓與牛津劍橋有甚密切之聯繫，凡由伊頓畢業，學自然科學者多入劍橋，學社會科學者多入牛津。牛津劍橋，有若伊頓之延續。</p>
<p>伊頓學校之著名，並非因其設備之完備，或程度之高超，乃以其特別注重儀表與人格陶冶，以備將來折衝樽俎，服務國家。一出該校附近，即見高冠燕尾之小紳士躑躅街頭。偶與接觸，則覺其彬彬有禮。由此校而躋入牛津劍橋，則大紳士不難昂首靑雲矣。過去馳騁壇玷，呼喚風雲之英國巨頭，多出身此校。據云，歷來首相出身於伊頓者已達十七人，其他達官顯貴更僕難數。該校現時固非全屬貴族，然即此常穿禮服，亦非貧寒子弟所能問津。但時勢推移，今日英國之顯要，已非復爲貴族所能獨佔。</p>
<p>溫莎宮</p>
<p>參觀伊頓學校畢，走訪溫莎宮。宮建於一五八三年，規模偉麗，作堡壘式。內陳舊砲甚多，有三門標明由中國戰役所獲，想係八國聯軍入北京之刦掠物。宮一部劃爲退伍軍官住宅，（可以住至終身）雖有嚴格限制，且不能容納多人，但藉此鼓勵士氣與維繫軍心，用意殊爲深遠。惜是日爲禮拜，各部多未開放，未及遍遊。宮中衛兵靜如木偶，敬禮尤爲機械。宮建於小邱上，鳥瞰市村，園林風景絕佳。宮雖矞麗，但尙有棄置不惜之溫莎公爵其人抑亦足爲此宮生色也歟？</p>
<p>車遊覽溫莎公園，園離宮約六七哩，遠村近樹，風景天成。昔爲帝室之獵塲，今爲平民之遊地。欲覓昔日之野豕麋鹿而不可得，但茂林　草，猶堪回溯。市郊整潔，住宅星疏，恬淡風光，有足多者。</p>

<p>一個東北初春雪花紛飛的傍晚，瀋陽某大建築物的電梯由下而上升，但電梯的門已壞了，當電梯上升以後，門仍開着。一個下級軍官立在門口，等候着電梯下來。這時門外進來了一位空軍少校。夜色朦朧，屋子裏燈光不甚明亮，但先在屋內的下級軍官已認出這是大隊附高又新，當即立正行了個敬禮。高又新還了禮。他看見電梯的門開着，以爲他的下屬是讓他先進電梯，於是，一步伸了過去。隨即，一個重量下墜的聲音轟然響起。高又新跌了下去，跌得相當深，頭部出血，腦神經受了極度的震盪，不省人事。</p>
<p>瀋陽缺乏醫　設備，把他送北平治療，高太太護侍在側情况似乎好轉了一點。這時，他辭去了第四大隊附之職，改任空軍總司令部附員。稍後，經北平南下，到了高太太的故鄉，湘江之濱—湖南長沙繼續潦養。一年過去，情况更好轉一點。爲了迅速痊愈起見，卅六年夏天，由空軍總司令部送受傷的高又新去美國作進一步治療。他在美住在空軍副總司令毛邦初將軍家裏，生活安定，靜心醫療。美國名醫檢驗之下，覺得他的病不必動手術，慢慢就會好。在長沙故鄉的高太太時常接到電報，甚爲安慰。在美半年，高又新差不多可以說全部恢復正常了，並且養得比以前胖得多。毛邦　將軍笑着對他說：「我想你又可担任新職務了」。</p>
<p>大家都這樣期望着新生的高又新。卅六年十二月，他乘美國運輸艦回國，在途經過四十餘天。抵滬後，他去亨利路二十七號親戚家中，手中持了幾百元美鈔，對他的親戚說：「這幾百元請你轉交給玲玲，我恐怕見不到她了」！說罷黯然神傷，並且不斷自言自語說自己身上有什麼臭味。他親戚甚爲奇怪。留他住宿宿，他不肯，更不放心。當晚，在空軍新生社把他找回來。在新生社碰見和高又新一同回國的同事，才知道他們所乘的運　艦途中遭遇大風浪，差不多已吿痊愈的高又新的腦神經重受强烈之震盪，而又吿失常。</p>
<p>「這是一種恐懼病，患者心理常有自卑之感」。當他親戚領他去看上海一個神經病科名醫粟宗華醫師時，粟醫師這樣說：「息這種病的人，我已接觸過好幾個。需要好好的靜養」。據粟醫生估計：大槪需要三個月至五個月的時間。每天打針吃藥並且應請兩個特別看護和他一起生活，每月約需款七千餘萬元。「這樣」，他說：「就會好起來」。</p>
<p>可是，高又新並未立刻遵照粟醫生所說的做。接着，高太太由湖南趕到上海會面。由她陪同去南京向空軍總司令部繼續請假。空軍總部就便將他送中央醫院治療。奇怪的是中央醫院的醫生竟診斷不出高又新的病情。他在院內食量大减，人瘦下去，只睡覺，不想講話。</p>
<p>高太太先後回過上海兩次。第二次是回來過陰曆年。原預備偕又新一起來滬渡歲，——高又新去問一位馬大夫：「我想到上海去過年可以嗎？」馬大夫這樣說：「像你這個樣子還想過什麼年！」作爲一個醫生居然不知道在病人面前有些話應該忌諱，至少應該說得技巧些。——這句話是多麼刺痛着又新創傷的心！</p>
<p>於是，高太太獨自回滬，在她親戚家過陰曆年。她面色憂鬱。在陰曆年初一，她接到又新南京來的電話，心情稍寬。年初二，獨個在京的又新去他叔父高永恩家拜年。只有他嬸嬸在家，給他泡了一杯茶。又新接在手裏，玻璃杯忽然碎了。他嬸嬸解嘲說：「這杯茶是我自己喝的。」</p>
<p>二月十三日（即陰曆年初四），高又新的一個朋友約他吃午飯。飯後送他回院。新年裏，醫院裘冷冷淸淸的，他忍不住寂寞，獨個兒溜了出來。他踱着步，走到五老橋附近，他站定了，呼吸一下新鮮空氣。他覺得很疲倦，預備回來。不遠的地方，一列小火車急駛而來。他驚覺他站的地方太狹，與鐵軌距離太近。他想跳到鐵軌那一邊去。他自信他的跳遠本領很好。但那知一個雨後初霽的下午，泥土鬆軟，施不出勁。他躍起後，便倒下了，正好倒在鐵軌上，風馳電掣的火車像泰山般壓在他身上。司機來不及煞車，車輪已再三輾過我們這位空中英雄的身上。幾小時以後，中央醫院才派車子來接屍體。</p>
<p>當晚，在滬的高太太，接到緊急電話，促速去南京。她抵京後，昏過去好幾次。只有廿歲，就做了未亡人！又新給她留下的，只是一個才滿週歲的女孩子。</p>
<p>蔣主席在廬山讀報，獲悉高又新死訊，深表哀痛，致送花圈一隻。中央各部會要員均紛送花圈輓詞。十六日在京開弔，空軍總司令周至柔親臨致祭。公葬定三月廿九日舉行。一代英骨，將長埋於中山陸後空軍烈士之墓！</p>
<p>高又新母親現住天津。姊姊尙未出嫁，在天津國立師範學院任保育院主任。一個弟弟在天津讀大學。他母親今年高齡六十多了，她聞悉愛子之死，我們想像得到她是多麼哀痛和憤怒！</p>

<p>〔本報瑞士航訊〕一九四八年二月，第五屆冬季世界遝動會，舉行於瑞士山中聖摩里茲村。各國人行旅乏資，阻於外匯之不易暢購，凑趣之遊賓，雖不若戰前一九二八年第二屆冬運之多，而一月三十日十時，瑞士總統歲利和領導下之開幕禮，躬與其列之男女選手，分隸五大洲之二十八國者，多至九百十五人，揚旗舉燧，排隊遊行，色彩鮮明，服御整麗，亦復廣羅萬彙，感極一時。計其前後九日會期之比賽事項，分爲如下述之十八部門。</p>
<p>競賽節目</p>
<p>（一）冰上曲棍球Hockey，比賽之次數最多，每日有之，（二）男女各別之花式滑冰figure　skating（三）男女配對之花式滑冰，（四）五百公尺（即半公里）滑冰比速speed　skating，（五）一公里半滑冰比速，（六）五公里滑冰比速，（七）十公里滑冰比速（以上七項屬於冰），（八）伏臥冰牀skeleton之橇雪比速，（九）二人疊坐橇雪比運two－man　bob－seleigh　races，（四）四人疊坐橇雪比速，（十一）十八公里滑雪長跑，（十二）五十公里滑雪skiing長跑，（十三）四十公里滑雪四人接力跑（每人十公里），（十四）男女個別之斜坡疾瀉cownhill　race，（十五）穿繞旗門之障礙紆越slalom　race（十六）滑雪跳壕（以上三項，有個別賽及綜合賽之殊），（十七）滑雪行軍兼射鵠，（十八）滑雪長跑，斜坡疾瀉，射鵠，劍術，馬術五項賽（以上之十一項屬於雪）。</p>
<p>冰球割愛</p>
<p>比賽開始所猝遇之不幸事件，爲美國有冰上曲棍球兩隊來預會，相持不下，東道主無法調停，此一部門，逐須割愛，而瑞士本國之冰面貢棍球鍵將，恐亦不獲一顯其好身手，皆不免興英雄無用武地之歎，蘇聯於本屆冬運，雖未有一羣選手，正式參加，而却遴選運動專家男女代表十人，自捷京出發，飛抵聖摩里茲山中，從事觀察。</p>
<p>值得提倡</p>
<p>吾華大國，北方不乏冬期積雪之名山，若一度爲冬運比賽集合之塲，則招致萬國遊賓，借無形之出口事業，以爲國利民福開新捷徑，其好處一言難盡，正不僅對內提倡健衛與修養，對外宣揚富產與文物之爲益也。如瑞士山村之地方當局，於茲會若何經營，滑雪跑馬道，曲棍溜冰塲，全長五十公里之直跑滑雪道，以海拔三千公尺爲最高點之滑雪行軍道，便於斜坡疾瀉兼飛躍等綜合賽之梯道與　壕，最新述動醫學之專站，廣播記者當塲發報之高山深谷八百所以上無綫軍站，若何佈置與籌維，確爲熱心新事業者所當乘機注意，而先期闡究者也。</p>

<h3 id="c157">第五六兩季輸入限額表　輸管會正式公布　平均數較第四季約少三成 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管曾昨日正式公布第五六兩季（三十七年二月至七月）附表（二）類貨品輸入限額表。該會限額分配處處長沈奏庭於午後三時半在中國銀行招待記者，對本期之轍入限額表加以補充說明。要點爲：五六兩季限額表內，柴油羊毛橡皮滑物油滑物油膏未列名植物性栲皮膏已洗電影片等各項，與第四季不相上下。棉花糧食煤炭智利硝硫酸及其他肥料，均不列入，將由政府視國家之需要情形，核定進口數量。除此之外，其他貨品之輸入限額，均較第四季爲小。政府內外匯頭寸缺乏，不得不减少限額，良非得已。五六兩季之平均數字，表面上較第四季少30％左右，但如將不列入之貨品計算在內，實際上僅减少10％强。第五第六兩季輸入限額之合併發表，目的有兩：一爲與國家預算相配合，二則爲半年一公布，使廠商能作較長期之打算。關於輸入限額究應直接配與工廠，或配由進口商轉手一點，胥視進口貨之性質而定。凡貨物之有內地零星用戶，無法直接配與廠家者，則配與進口商，例如電影片汽油木材五金等，均屬此類。反之如羊毛太槳等，則自可直接配與工廠。關於外傳有若干進口商人，於調得配額後，用以出售獲利節，沈氏認爲不可能，因該會對進口商登記頗爲嚴格，登記合格者必須對外有經常之業務，目前配得之限額，亦有一定之依據；而許可證之發給，須以訂貨合同爲憑，故殊少舞弊之可能云。茲將各進口貨品之限額分配詳細數字附則如下：（單位千美元）</p>

<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>因爲生活習慣以及其他種種的關係，我們中國人生了病之後總歡喜住在家中而不肯住在醫院裏。這其間的利弊很多，一時不能　述，璧如說吧，家專總比隊院　舒服得多，親人的服侍總比看護的服侍好些。但是家　的設備不適合於醫治的目的，親人的服侍不能應付病症的變化，那又是住在醫院好些了。因此，爲　要適應病家方面這種矛盾式的需要起見，所謂家庭特別看護便應運遝而生了。眞的，爲病人方面作想，眞是合算之至，旣可以很舒服地住在家裏享受親人的服侍，又可以塡補醫藥和衛生方面的種種缺憾，那眞是太理想化了。</p>
<p>可是，事實往往是與理想相違反的。尤其是這種家庭式的特別　護。她們中雖則有不少是正式獲士學畢業或則是大醫院裏多年訓練出來的。然而大多數一的特別看護的素質都是非常的低劣，不要說是一切的普通醫學常識完全不懂，就連應付病人的一種心理也不懂，而且最是要不得的是對於病人的健康沒有責任心，不管他的症情變化，總是漢然無動於中，不曉得去提示病人或病人的親友，更不知導如何地去報吿醫師。有的時候，她們還老三老四去批評醫師的療法或介紹些什麽　方去供病人哩。</p>
<p>我們切不要小視這種特別看護的舉動是無損於病家和醫師兩方而！實在說，她可以把很有希望的病人在無形中斷送了哩。因此，我十聲疾呼地要求家庭特別看護　再建設，我希望衛生當局加以取締或則加以改良！</p>
<h3 id="c173">促增母乳方法 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 吳曼青</p>
<p>據英國倫敦聖湯姆士醫院（St．Thomas　Hospial　London）之M．Robinsan醫師報吿，彼曾於五佰症例中實地硏究產婦授乳期中之各稱分沁情形。彼以爲給予大量之甲狀腺素（Thyreoicea　sicca）固然可以促使乳汁分泌增多，而用盧歌氏溶液（即Lrgol＇s　Lolution每天給予產婦二次每次六滴，和牛乳內服）則更能促使乳汁分泌加强，至於使用其他內分泌素以求其乳汁分泌坍加，則效用非常微小固然，吾人可以使用內分泌素（如Oetragen）以求增加乳汁，但只能在產後之四天內用之。且用量若或不愼，則非惟乳汁不能增多反爾乳汁减少。魯濱孫氏又謂，若乳汁於生產之第五天中能有二百八十五西西，又在第十天中能有四百五十五西西，則此後之六個月內不愁乳汁之分泌减少。普通治療乳汁之分泌過少者，應於產後之第六日起始，若其乳量不及285西西，則應爲之治療而不容再延時日。至其乳量之計算方法，則甚簡單，只須於授乳前後以磅秤計算嬰孩之體重，則可測知確數。此外爲欲測知其乳量之實際情形起見，應於授乳之第四星期後再行加以檢驗，以便設法維持其原有水準。魯濱孫氏曾於患乳汁過少症之九十九症例中選出廿七人加以盧歌爾氏溶液之治療（此溶液內含百份五之碘及百份卞之碘化鉀）。其餘之患者則間或令其按摩乳部以期促進乳汁之分泌，間或以等張性之生理食鹽水注射（每隔一天注射肌肉內一次，每次一西西，共須注射五次），間或絲奄不加以治療，以爲上述方法之比較。至於服用上述之盧歌爾氏溶液者則令其每日服用，連續服至每日之乳量達到四百五十五西西爲止（總共約需七天）。其中之七人則因授乳時乳頭被吸非常疼痛，自願放棄授乳工作，是以無從考驗其盧歌爾氏溶液之功效究竟有若何程度。又在此七人中亦有人之乳量因計算不甚準確而未被認作考驗之對象者。此外其中之一人於乳部患有甚為痛楚之硬塊，於服用盧歌爾氏氏溶液之廿四小時後更爲痛楚。由此推論，此類病人當然不宜服用盧歌爾氏溶液。惟此硬塊若能於每四小時內用smg　Oesrrogen內服而消散，則於後亦可令其服用盧歌爾氏溶液以促進其乳汁之分泌，而不致於再有硬塊之發生。</p>
<p>照上述情形實施測騐之後其內服盧歌爾氏溶液者於第十二天中得乳汁四百五十六西西（約等於普通康健產婦之分泌量）。其用乳部按摩術者僅有三百十四西西，用等張性生理食鹽水注射者一百五十六西西，其完全不加治療者則有一百七十一西西。又在上述方法之第四星期後則用盧歌爾氏溶液者爲五百九十八西西（康健之產婦分泌量此時應爲七百十西西），用按摩法者三百十三西西，用等張生斑食鹽水者三百四十二西西，而共不加治療者則仍爲一百七十一西西，惟已無心於哺乳其小孩云。其最使吾人注意者則爲凡曾服用含有　質之盧歌爾氏溶液者皆未嘗有碘　之副作用發生。且其所營養之小孩皆能長大而且健康。惟有其中之某一產婦則於產後之七天內僅有乳汁數滴，且在產後之第二天起乳部即已發漲而成硬塊。於是即於產後第三夭起給以Oetroen內服，且於第七天起軟化如常。於是繼續給與碘劑，比及第十三天後則已有乳汁二百西西矣。</p>
<p>此外又有患乳汁分泌太少者共凡九例，皆於產褥期之終了時間給以碘劑溶液。（每天服三次每次O．6cc和於牛乳中內服）。約在三星期後有三人之小孩巳可完全靠其母乳之營養而生存。又在九人中僅有一一例似無效騐而已。</p>
<p>根據以上之實驗而言，乳汁分泌之所以缺少者似乎與續質之缺乏及卵巢分泌之障碍大有關係。在產後之最初四天內可以卵巢製劑治之。其所謂乳部發漲，變成硬塊而有濃厚而帶黄色之乳汁者即爲卵巢分泌發生障碍之故。若其乳部軟錦而虛空者則爲碘質缺少之故也。故於卵巢分泌　生障碍時給予碘劑當然無效，必須於卵巢分泌正常後方可用碘劑而能得其效益。又據作者報吿，此種促使乳汁分泌增多之方法不惟於嬰孩方而無妨即於產婦方面亦毫無關係云（見一九四七年份英國醫學什誌四五一六百Brit．M．J．1947，4516）</p>
<h3 id="c174">肺結核的防御 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>今特介紹早期症狀數點如后：</p>
<p>1·感冒五週以上未愈者，久嗽不止，</p>
<p>2·午後發熱，兩頰潮紅，夜間盜汗，偶有咳嗽（聲短而小）無痰。</p>
<p>3·體軍减輕，身體　弱。</p>
<p>4·聲音嘶嘎，呼吸困難，背部疼痛。</p>
<p>5·忽然咯血，或曾經咯血。</p>
<p>6·消化不良，食慾不振，食量减少。</p>
<p>7·稍事勞動，即感疲倦。</p>
<p>8·淸晨起床，漸漸咳嗽吐炎，無故疲倦。</p>
<p>凡發現有上列種種情形者，即應請專科醫師檢査。最好用X光透視胸部。經檢査後，如非肺結核，自是幸運；如不幸而得肺病，則應抱極大決心，就醫治療，絕對遵守醫師指導，始有治愈的希望。</p>
<p>（六）肺結核的防禦</p>
<p>世界結核病最盛行的國家，要算中國第一。流行猖獗，影響巨大。實足以爲鬥家强袞，民族存亡的決定因素。五十年前在歐美各國，大多相同。以後結核病傳染逐漸减少，近年進步尤速。單以美國而論，九十年前結核病死亡率近四百人。一九〇〇年。每十萬人死亡二〇二人，以後死亡率逐漸下降。每十年計算一次，第一十年間降低百分之二十；第二十年間，降低百分之二三；第三十年間，降低百分之三十三；第四十年間，降低百分之三十四。直到一九四〇年其死亡率僅十萬分之四五。他們並計劃準備剷除結核，使結核病死亡率再繼續下降。預計一九五〇將爲百分之三十二，一九六〇將爲百分之二十一，一九七〇將爲百分之十四，一九八〇將爲百分之十，在二〇〇〇年以後，則可使結核病在美國絕跡。因爲結核病確是可以預防制止的疾病。昔日結核病爲歐美各國疾病死亡率之首位，今則降至七八位矣。如若我國善事防禦，制止此種接觸性疾病少蔓延。改善社會環境，增加對結核病的抵抗力，减少此病之流行。通力合作，則結核病之問題亦不難解決，而能收實效矣。</p>
<p>一，防禦原則：</p>
<p>（一）早期發現，報吿，診治，隔離肺結核患者。</p>
<p>（二）防止傳染的蔓延與减少感染機會。</p>
<p>（三）制止侵入人體內結核菌之　殖與蔓延。</p>
<p>（四）增加思者抵抗力，改善營養，並設置　良的生活環境。</p>
<p>五，推行預　防免疫的方法。</p>
<p>六，防禦工作應藉政府行政力　普遍嚴格施行。</p>
<p>二，防禦方法：</p>
<p>一，防禦專染：</p>
<p>（一）衛生敎育　我國一般人民缺乏基本衛生常識。更不了解結核病之特徵，傳染，預防，休息，療養等。而任性作爲，至蔓延愈廣，傳播愈烈。故務使人民有正確之認識，以期防禦容易。如隨地吐痰等習性，應特別予以糾正，則收益至大。</p>
<p>（二）結核病檢舉　治病不如防病。要防禦傳染，减少感染機會。在公共方面，實行肺結核患者檢舉。對於早期患者施行嚴密檢査，發現結核病人，立刻報吿衛生當局，施以管理與隔離。</p>
<p>（三）公共檢疫對已死結核病人當施行嚴密消毒。因結核病係慢性傳染病，而很少人注意。對患者住室，用具，排泄物，應嚴密消毒。他如牛乳管理，乳牛須定期施行結核菌素試騐，有乳房結核的牛，不應供給牛乳，並應殺死後焚燒之。牛乳飲前應行消毒，以杜絕傳染。</p>
<p>（四）患者隔離隔離一人，保護衆人，凡患結核病者，應加長期隔離，令其住院療養。而不應再與健康者接觸。若在家中療養，應獨宿，單食。病人所用之碗筷，杯盆都應煮沸消毒，並與別人分用。他如肺結核病人之痰液，膿等，應用火焚燒，殺死病原體，衣服，被褥等亦應消毒，以除絕傳染機會。</p>
<p>（五）處理接　　家中發現結核病患者時，陰將病人送院治療，或在家中予以處理外。病人家屬之嚴格檢査，殆爲必要之手續。而此時實施此事，亦較容易。此法可早期發現病人，早獲治療機會。並可以察出傳染來源，予以根絕，以减少結核病之威嚇。</p>
<p>（六）家　護助一般人民缺乏衛生智識，兼由經濟環境不良，至癆病流行甚烈。除注意患者強制療養外，並對患者家屬應予以指導與護助，以免傳染廣大。並作家屬體格檢査，證明是否已被感染，以防蔓延。</p>
<p>（七）免費診治凡患結核病者，多應經濟困難。故對其診治療養費用，應當免費供給。使有充分治療養護的機會。並免再到人羣中，增加傳染的危機與來源。</p>
<p>（八）改善環境關於小滴傳染更應注意，如售票處，銀行，商店交易處，公共電話機等皆小滴染最易之處，故應設法避免。其關於公共食店，旅社，浴室，理髮室等，其公共器具應行消毒。其次爲减少人口密度。凡羣衆　集之城市建築，應採用田園都市建築法。减少人口密度，屛絕傳染機會。</p>
<p>（九）勞工保健此僅限於產生灰塵職業工作者及接觸機會頻繁職業工作者。關於防禦傳染，應對易感染結核職業工作者，每日工作時間予以减少。並分段工作，使有充分休息機會，以免過勞。此種工作設備尤應力求改善。然最好於相當長期工作以後，令其轉業。於工作期內，每三月舉行X光透視一次。</p>
<p>（十）婚姻限制　凡患活動性肺結核病者，往往因結婚而病勢嚴重，尤以生育爲最。旣婚婦罹活動性肺結核者，應阻止受孕，或四月前使墮胎。潛伏性肺結核者，若有加答兒症狀，發燒，有再發可能，應施行人工流產。哺乳婦新發肺結核病者，應停止哺養幼兒。諸如此類，爲避免傳染，政府應當勒令禁止。活動性肺結核不得結婚，已婚者，亦不應同居。</p>
<p>二，改善生活：</p>
<p>（一）寬心　若果眞正不幸，得了結核病，不用害怕，也不耍以爲生命絕望，自己頺喪，憂戚。而應充分休養，靜心耐性的調養，屛棄一切悲觀與失望，抱一種此病總有一天要好的態度。心神暢快，是治愈的要件。抱悲觀的人，乃是把恐慌的毒素加放在結核桿菌的毒素裏，以自速其死亡</p>
<p>（二）安靜　心理作用，對病影饗至大。應盡力控制情緒，安靜勿躁。因安靜休養可以節省人的體力，减少呼吸次數。（平常每二十四小時內，平均約有三萬五千次呼吸，如平臥床上，每二十四小時可减少五千次）並减少血行的壓力，以及减少　博次數。身體新陳代謝的率度，也同時降低。節省體力和新陳代謝低降，即是减少身體組織的消耗和損傷。間接，即可使身體增加重量。减少呼吸次數，即是使已病之肺减少擴張和收縮作用。此兩點是治療肺病的柱石。</p>
<p>（三）節制　臥床靜養，不宜勞動。進公園，打麻雀，不是休息。除非有醫師的指導，不　運　。不要咳嗽。咳嗽就是最壞　深呼吸。覺得有痰要咳嗽的時候，安安靜靜的向外呼氣，使痰出來。不咳嗽，痰也能出來，這是病人應當學習的。不吸烟，不飮酒，不可往地上吐痰，不可親吻小孩等。</p>
<p>（四）環境人類的健康，與其所處環境之是否合於衛生的條件，有極密切的因果關係。我們旣然不能脫離環境而獨立存在，要想得到健康的生活，减少疾病的威脅，就得改變生活環境，除掉各種足以危害我們健康的東西。使它能合乎衛生條件。直接减少和病菌接觸的機會，間接增進身體之抗力。則自可以健康，關於結核病之環境改善，以下討論。</p>
<p>三，設備療養</p>
<p>（一）地位選擇</p>
<p>A日光　結核病人療養的時候，應居於幽雅淸潔之房間，窗戶常開，使陽光充分直射，空氣流通。因日光中含有紫外綫。其對　皮膚結核尤存特殊效力，且可增進身體的抵抗力，促進新陳代謝旺盛。對體內的結核亦有相當的作用。故可行日光浴，但須遵守醫師的規定，不是各個結核病人都可浴日。石英燈療法也是一種，其理相同。浴日時，要脫去衣服，也不要隔着玻璃，因爲大部份的超紫外綫都被玻璃吸去了。　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c175">榆樹綫菌症 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 魏兆麒</p>
<p>本文所述之榆樹綫茵症，讀者必覺其名詞甚爲陌生，蓋不特東亞之醫書雜誌極少刋載，即如歐美之文獻亦罕有論及。其實此症往往亦見於吾人之臨診時中，特以其症象極易與其他症象相混，故吾人未嘗注意及之耳。作者於去夏返粤，臨診所及，曾遇數例，深覺其對於內科臨床之診斷方面甚有介紹之價値，因特爲文述之，范亦爲方家所見許歟。惟鄉間陋僻，手頭可供參考之書籍甚少，良知掛一漏萬，在听不急，尙祈海內先進，不吝賜敎。至於本文中所　細菌檢査工作，曾得梁　靑醫師之助，麒不敢掠人之美，用特附誌於此，藉示不忘云爾</p>
<p>按楡樹綫菌症德文名爲Ulmenkrankheit，於西曆一千八百年間已有人爲文述之。謂其症與楡樹有關，凡曾與楡樹接觸者，例患一種劇烈之氣枝管炎云。惜其時未有細菌學之檢驗，故未能詳究厥原，爲之印證，因而讀者疑信參半，不加注意，厥後爲時日久，則又談焉忘之矣。近數年來，曾有植物學專家數人加以研究，知楡樹確有一種細菌，可以染人致病。惟亦言人人殊，名稱不一，且亦未嘗詳及臨床症象也。昔年比國Louvain曾有楡樹綫菌症之普遍傳染發生，專家Schwarz氏曾加以詳細之研究，知楡樹上確附生一種細菌，普遍長度約爲0．5—2．0mm，間亦有10—17mm長者。若在培養基則可長至八十mm。此種細菌爲一種綫形菌，往往疏密相間，集而成束。至其末端則有冠狀物爲之聯系。Sclrwarz氏乃名之爲Graphium　ulmi（意即楡樹綫菌）而本文之西名Graphiomycoe蓋即取材於此也。厥後Louvain大學敎授Ph．Biourge氏，G．Van．Cutsem氏及E．Brepo氏曾繼續加以研究，均證實Schwarz氏之說。且對於臨床症象曾有詳細之介紹。而其中之Brec’o氏且謂在患氣枝管炎之病人中曾有廿一例檢得其痰內含有楡樹綫菌云。</p>
<p>考楡樹綫菌症之發生由於與楡樹之接觸，上文亦已言及之矣。其實凡與蘋果樹或梨樹接觸者亦易患此。又如食蘋果或梨者如或漫不經意，將果皮上之綫菌送入口內，則亦傳染此症。此外如食生査或木瓜者亦易染此。我國人每喜拾人牙惠，以爲食蘋果或梨之類　　　，方可將果皮內之維他命素完全享受，詎知綫菌之傳染乃藉此發生，良可慨也。此種綫菌入口之後，經過短期之潛伏，即行發作。起初爲普遍型之氣枝管炎，喉間作癢，咳嗽，有少許透明之粘痰，致病者漫不經意，以爲所患不過普通之感冒而已。惟因其經久不愈，且咳嗽轉劇而帶有氣喘與痙攣性症象，同時胸口苦悶，飲食不佳，全身運和兼有發熱，病者往往以爲患有肺結核症。即如臨診之醫生亦以爲患肺結核症，蓋若聽診其肺部則往往有水泡性雜音或則其肺音較之康健者减低許多也。但若以愛克司光診察之，則其肺部並無絲毫結核症象。至於所咳出之痰液，則多半爲粘液體，極富粘性。吾人若以火柴梗挑之，可將整塊之痰液挑起。而以染色檢驗之，則可發現其中有無數之綫菌焉。</p>
<p>除上述之呼吸系症象外，線菌亦可侵襲各處之關節，而引起慢性之關節炎症。此外線菌又可侵入皮膚而引成皮下膿瘍症。最後則凡患楡樹線菌症者往往患有末稍神經痛與麻痺現象</p>
<p>至於治療方面，上述諸氏均主用碘劑，曾謂極有見效云。至於所用份量以每天一至三格蘭爲度，有時在廿四小時亦可加至七格蘭碘劑云。惟以予個人之經騐而言則以Ammon　joca爲佳，蓋其奏效速而副作用甚少也</p>
<h3 id="c176">醫事新聞 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>（一）預防子宮頸生癌法</p>
<p>據美國B．Z．Cashman氏多年硏究之結果，似乎子宮頸部癌腫之發生與子宮頸部之慢性發炎甚有關係。蓋子宮頸癌之發生甚爲遲緩，往往發現於不知不覺之間，比及爲人發覺，則已不及醫治。誠恨事也。惟據調査所得，則知所有子宮頸部癌症之患者皆有多年之子宮頸部慢性發炎症。是以卡氏主張，凡係廿五歲以上之婦女若有慢性之子宮頸部發炎症者，必須及早爲之醫治痊愈。則子宮頸部癌症之發生似可因此避免。惟卡氏又云子宮頸部之慢性發炎症甚難治愈。必要時月須使用子宮頸部之底層電烙術方可將其發炎病灶淸除云。（見美國一九四五年二月份之產婦科醫學雜誌）</p>
<p>（二）氣喘症及其他過敏症與內分泌</p>
<p>據C．Kousmine氏報吿，內分泌之障碍與氣喘症，濕疹，鼻膜炎，關節風濕以及其他過敏性病症之發作皆有重大之關係。柯氏曾經研究上述各病之患者，在其病症之發作期中小便內驗得有大量之間腦下埀腺前葉素（Gonadotropes　Horman）流出。因此柯氏加以推論將來之內分泌研究如果能够澈底明瞭，則上述之各種病症必可迎刃而解云。（見一九四七年二月份第八期之瑞士醫學周報）</p>
<p>（三）利用超音波療治各種病症</p>
<p>據捷克醫師J．Zeman氏報吿，利用超音波之振動數可以探測腦部癌腫之地位，亦可以檢查腹內各種內臟之各種變化情形，並且可治各種風濕症。惟急性神經痛以及關節炎症則不可使用云。（見一九四七年六月份之揵克醫報）。</p>
<p>（四）小兒性麻痺症在美國猖獗</p>
<p>吾人在上海發現有小兒性麻痺症數起（實際上究有多少，因缺乏調査統計資料，是以無從知悉）已甚以爲奇特惟據維也納醫學週報所載，則一九四六年間美國之患有此症共凡二千六百人，其中需要鐵肺以維持其呼吸工作者且有二百人。可見此症之猖獗。我國之衛生情形較之美國當然更加　劣。則此症之逐漸增多，更爲預料中事，深盼我國衛生行政當局，趕速設法有以防止之也。</p>
<p>（五）治憂　症之新藥</p>
<p>意大利羅馬大學之神經病學敎授Ugo　Cerletti氏曾經發明一種專治各種憂（Melancholie）之新華名爲Akroagonin據稱此爲某種動物之腦質提煉物，治上述各種病症甚有效騐云。（按發明者爲創用電氣震盪術療治神經病症之第一人，在神經病學方面固爲權威也。）</p>
<p>（六）美國之生產率及生病率</p>
<p>據美國衛生調査統計所載，在一九四六年中每隔二秒鐘中有一人送進醫院療治。在此一年中因病住院之美國人共有（151153452人，而一九四五年中則有16257402人。每隔十五秒鐘則有一嬰兒在醫院內產生。（一九四六年份共有2136373初生兒，一九四五年份則僅有1969667人）又一九四六年之患肺結核症者則有九萬九千七百四十一人（一九四五年份則僅有八萬二千一百八十六人），已較上年爲多云。</p>

<p>（三）本路舉辦餐務，係爲旅客福利着想，力求舒適經濟實惠，减輕國人視旅行爲畏途之普遍心理，並轉移社會人士對於鐵路之印象，故供應範圍，日趨擴展，務求適合各等旅客之需要。如最近添辦三四等車點心茶水之供應，並籌辦豆漿麵點等，定價低廉，不以營利爲目的。又奴各站餐室之設置，在簡潔樸素原則下，佈置美化環境，使旅客於僕僕風塵之餘，獲得刹那之憇息，於身心不無補助。</p>
<p>（四）京滬為我國門戶，友邦人士，往來頻繁，國際觀　所　，餐務離屬極小業務，然牽一　而動全身，不無利害關係。　基於上述原因，本路爲使每一旅客均得實惠，每一站臺均達　肅標準，對於供應旅供應飲　　務，不得不力謀改革，故對各大站攤站販之收回自辦，似屬刻不容緩。</p>
<p>惟査各該站有一部份係復員　站販，因經營較久，轉業不無困難，爲維持彼等生計起見，現正査明酌予　派　近其他小站　業，或另派其他工作，以資救濟。承貴報，垂詢，特函奉復。此致申報社會服務科京滬區　路管理局　務處啓</p>

<h3 id="c178">生命與文化 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>一個民族是否會像菓樹一般的由幼芽，生長，結果以至爛熟？這個發間也許要被人認爲太幼稚了，但我有些懷疑，或者說是有些惶惑、</p>
<p>我當然知道，要答覆這個問題，應先將生命　　義分別淸楚；因爲生命有個別的生命，有抓族的生命。個別　生命到現在爲止，仍逃不了新陳代謝的進化鐵律，雖然現代的科學突飛猛進，但其能力還僅能做到延長生命，尙不能創造生命或無限地使個別的生命延續，就是　新的人工授胎法，亦祗是將生命的胚芽予以人工授胎，並非是眞正創造了生命。</p>
<p>至於種族的生命當然不同了。種族的生命是可能無限延續的，而且不僅能延續，且在其發展的某一個階段可起質變而發展成另一種新的生命。由精卵的結合爲千萬稀動植物的生命，都是由生命無窮質變的結果。</p>
<p>這裏並不想多談生物學。我想說的是，種族的生命雖然具有無限延續與發展的性能，但却並非絕無條件，而主要條件之一就是能不絕保持新的血液。尤其構成一個國家生命的民族，更非不絕循環着新的血液不可，否則就難免由生長而爛熟，由爛熟而腐化，而沒落。</p>
<p>但用甚麽東西可以來測度　民族的興盛與衰落呢？是文化—民族的生活文化。所以特別要　出是生活文化，是有道理的，囚爲一個民族的文化有種種的樣相。舉例言，一個國家與民族的歷史文化，就不一定能表現其現實的生活文化。就歷史文化言，中國當然是了不起的國家，可是　像今日的意大利或希臘的民族生活文化不一定是表現了古代羅馬與希臘的文化一樣，今天我們　民族生活文化，也已去我們古　的文化成就甚遠。</p>
<p>有一部人曾稱中國人是保守民族，其實當眞能名副其實的保守，倒還吧了。這猶如有錢人家的子孫，如能守產以終，猶不　爲對得罷祖宗上人。可是我們　在談不到是在保守。要知保守　得有能够保守的魄力。因爲保、並不即是意味停止，世上的一　境象祗有不進即退四個字。能　不利的條件下守得住，這不是保守，而是進步；在不利或有利　條件下沒有進步，這便不是保　，實在是退步</p>
<p>如果說西方的英國和東方的　國都是保守的民族，則英國人保守就是進步的保守，而我們　是退步，談不到保守。這並不　長他人志氣滅自己威風的說話，你隨便比較中英社會風氣的異　，即能看出誰的民族生活文化　有朝氣，富有向上的氣息。</p>
<p>言眞理雖可逞一時之快，　　畢竟無用。我們的民族生活　化，顯然巳由爛熟而臨近沒落　人民心理的低調與悲觀氣氛，　是這種現象的信號。長於世故</p>
<p>一輩，好將一切事情看得太激底，而年靑的一輩，則又將一切　情看得太近視。因為看得太澈底，便覺得一切無所謂；因爲看　太近視，便覺得一切無辦法。　兩者的心理歸宿便是絕望，悲　，表現於生活文化，便是腐敗與消沉。</p>
<p>但是中國民族的現代生活文化雖已趨向　熟沒落的階段，却　不是絕無挽救的辦法。不過這辦法並非如一，部份人所主張的重無世道人心，而是在於怎樣創造新的生活方式以革新奄奄一息的社會風氣，也就是以新的血液灌輪到我們行將沒落的民族生活文化中去。</p>
<h3 id="c179">滬瀆舊景 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 劉雁聲</p>
<p>江南金粉之地，洋塲絲扇之家。前人咏滬城景色，輒以爲得　上開通風氣之先，笙歌匝地，視爲人間天上。余數度作客滬　，於流風餘韻，　多留意。數十年後之今日，翻　首人所記，又恍惚如臨異地。　福軒主人詩云：瑯環文物留　續，待取他年夢裏痕」，遇古　今，訪尋曲跡，懷觸臨風，是又風土上之可珍貴者也。</p>
<p>天南　叟王　於其所著之　　雜誌中，記及滬城舊有八景，時名人多有題咏。八景爲「海大旭日」，「黄油秋舊」，「龍　晚鐘」，「吳淞烟雨」，「石　夜月」，「野波　　」，「鳳樓逮眺」，「江皋雪齊」等。此八景雖無詳注，然窺其字意，似多偏於野水層雲，汪洋大波，於洋塲繁華之景，未表隻字。</p>
<p>在此滬城八景以外，有好事者擬爲滬北十景，始以都市繁華爲中心，於景色中又可知昔日滬上之社會情形。十景計爲「桂園觀劇」，「新樓選饌」，「　閣嘗烟」，「醉樂飲酒」，「松風品茶」，「桂馨訪美」，「層樓聽書」，「飛軍擁麗」，「夜市燃燈」，「浦濱步月」。此十景每條前兩字，多爲昔日著名館地。桂園即丹桂茶園，新樓即大新酒樓，雲閣即靑雲閣，桂馨即昔日北里，餘可類推。觀此十景所述，多爲今日所無，且時過境遷，未足爲一社會著稱之所在，如雲閣嘗烟，是爲形容阿芙蓉者，今且懸爲厲禁矣。至於飛車擁麗云云，此情此景，吾人可於海上漱石生所著之「九尾龜」，及以滬語寫成之「海上花列傳」中見到當年景况。</p>
<p>在此八景十景以外，瀛壖雜誌甲更有記及印江詞客及古月山房所權滬上竹枝詞達六七十　之多。印江詞客句中有「萬里通商海禁開，千年蒼塚幻樓台，可憐酒地花天裏，夜有青萊注草萊」之句，傷今弔古，垂意彌遠。又如：「別有風光一洞天，好花香到舞樓前，笙歌夜謂霓裳曲，妬殺蟾宮女謫仙」，又如：「凌陂微步波虹橋，倒影春潭水亦嬌，生怕來舟打嬌影，隔篷人巳　停橈」。此均爲描寫滬地社會繁華景象，無一不在笙歌中渡過也。竹枝詞中關於滬地季節風俗者，如：「燈球火樹鬧元宵，男女喧聞似湧潮，夜靜人稀斜月冷，誰家　閣正吹蕭」。現今正在舊年時間中，遠想當年鬧元宵之致，可見太平粉飾，與今不同。又如：「約伴燒香邑廟時，靈籤偷掣第三枝，暗將心事低頭訴，不怕神知怕姊知」。於描寫習俗之中，宛轉寫到小兒女心情聲口，妙到毫顚。</p>
<p>古月山房竹枝詞中，除描寫酒色徵遂外，能獨日隻眼，爲旁敲側擊之說法，其詞云：「萬里長空一鏡磨，樓合倒影入江波，此邦亦有淸涼境，搔首何人發浩歌」。殊不知數十年後，洋塲十里，其繁華情景，猶勝於前也！</p>
<h3 id="c180">談送禮 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>這裏，讓我先錄一節電訊：</p>
<p>「除夕陽鄂某縣田糧處科長携年禮晋省，送省田糧處處長吳良琛，吳發現禮品內，置金條一根，手鐲一對。遂將原物呈萬主席，萬氏甚爲震怒，即將該科長扣押。」</p>
<p>在送禮之風盛行的今天，我想這節新聞不會是　構　。本來，我們是一個禮節繁縟，講究面子的國度，送禮一事，可謂由來已久了。人情往來，本來也就不必苛責。只是，送禮之舉一走進政治塲合，便常被當作一種手段在運用了。</p>
<p>以上面這節新聞爲例，吳良琛之見金條而不心動，尙不失爲一個好官；淸者自淸，濁者自濁，也可以從這兒得到一個明證。若「該科長」者，就不堪聞問了。一個區區的科長，居然可以用金條金鐲送給上司，塲面不算不闊；傘他應得的薪給與這比較一下，我們不難明白這是怎樣的一個官兒—此外，下屬可以直　對自己的上司送禮品，這個官塲的風紀也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>記得去歲的舊曆中秋節前，京滬一帶曾發起所謂「不送禮運動」，一時如火如荼，那自然正是針對這種不正常的病態而發的，可惜「曲高和寡」，並沒有十分生效，所以舊曆年尾，食品店中，包扎好的禮品，多如山積，其價目動輒數十百萬，也絕非一個奉公守法，潔身自愛的窮公務員所能光顧的。金條金鐲之類的貴重物品，自然更不必談了。</p>
<p>從另外一個角度看，送禮運動自在官塲中風　以後，也就是一種私相授受，納賄貪污行爲的擴大，實與一班鑽營的無恥之徒大開方便之門。此風一日不去，澄淸吏治便成爲極不容易的事情。這種勾當，在稍　廉恥，稍具氣節的人，當然是不肯爲的，而因此「好人」在官塲就更難立足，建立「好人政府」，提倡「好人政治」，也就流於空談。所以，這種「送禮」的風氣，在官塲中實在是一種毒瘤！</p>
<p>我們實在希望今日之一般爲機關首長者，能向吳良琛看齊！</p>
<h3 id="c181">金錢買不到的東西 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>「有錢能使鬼推磨」，不錯，有時候金錢是萬能的；但是，世界上至少有一件東西依然是金錢所不能購買的—那就是感情。當混世魔王拿破崙的姪子，法蘭西皇帝路易。拿　崙試圖替他的妻子友琴妮皇后收購一隻嵌鑲着鎭石的錶的時候，這位妄想統治歐洲的暴君得到了金錢非萬能的敎訓。</p>
<p>在一八五二年，美國人却爾斯。古德意以許多橡皮的製成品參加巴黎展覽會，因爲當時橡皮尙不爲世人所注意，他的原意就在顯示橡皮的重要性和多方面的功用。他所陳列的東西有橡皮手鐲，橡皮項飾，橡皮戒子等，不過，其中最精緻的東西要算一隻鑲鑽的錶。全巴黎城都響往　隻錶，尤其是友琴妮皇后。她一定要將它弄到手，她認爲問題的焦點衹在乎價格的上下。</p>
<p>但是這隻錶是非賣品。古德意是專爲他的妻子造這隻錶的，而她却不幸在展覽會揭幕之前在英國去世了。所以，這隻　有它的極大的感情的價値，不是友琴妮的權勢和法蘭西皇室的財庫所能收買下來的。</p>
<p>路易拿破崙在絕望之中，不惜躬身到巴黎的平民區去拜訪古德意。</p>
<p>「古德意先生，除非皇后有了那隻錶，我們家庭是不會太平的」，他懇求說。</p>
<p>古德意同情法皇的苦衷。最後，他想出了一個兩全的方法—仿造一隻。在皇家鑽工的協助之下，他完成了工作，將第二隻橡皮錶呈獻給了貪婪的友琴妮。當她活着的時候，古德意始終未再將原錶陳列過，而她至死還相信她所有的是世界上獨一無二的鑲鑽橡皮欽—她以爲金錢確是萬能的。</p>
<p>而那個以橡皮起家的美國人，非獨使一個皇后快活，並且使他自已的良心安逸，還使他的荷包裝得滿滿的。</p>
<h3 id="c182">患難之交 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>

<p>布羅克林聯邦法院新近審結了一件未之前見的患難中合作的案件，緣有物價管理局査賬員二人左樂與特羅埃，在行使職　時收受賄賂，案發被人控吿到法院。</p>
<p>法官判令二人罰金二十元，徒刑九月，辯護律師起立發言，「因該案各被吿家庭情形特殊，請求當庭法外施仁，酌量减刑。</p>
<p>律師所指的特殊情形是：左樂是兩個孩子的父親，而特羅埃則有四個小孩，如其兩人同時執行徒刑，家庭方面將感受過度的艱困，不言而喩。因此律師的建議是請求法官允准兩被吿並不同時執行徒刑，好使一方謀生以濟另一方之貧困。「兩被吿業已同意當一人坐監時，另一人願意負担其家庭生活」。結果如願以償，左樂與特羅埃可以分期科刑。法院還進一步改短徒刑爲六個月。</p>
<p>特羅埃被指定爲先行　禁，左樂以一千五百元現金保釋。兩人同事七年，因共　樂而受賄遭難，遂眞的成爲能共患難而不能共安樂的朋友！</p>

<p>— 俞逸芬</p>
<p>張懿孫颯橋夜泊一詩，傳誦千古，而尤盛行於東瀛，戰時日兵之在江南者，莫不歌呼嗚嗚而講是詩，蘇州骨董肆中凡此詩拓片，悉爲搜購一空，至取翻刻　本以應。兪曲園新修寒山寺記：「吳中寺院不下千百區，而寒山寺以懿孫一詩，其名不獨膾炙於中國，抑且傳誦於東瀛，余寓吳久，凡日本文墨之士，咸造廬來見，見則往往言及寒山寺，且言其國三尺之童，無不能誦是詩者。」可知其深入人心，由來已久。寺中此詩刻石，第一石郇公（名珪字禹玉）書，程公闢詩所謂「張繼留題內翰書」也，久佚。第二石明文徵明書，無年月，四行，每行字不等，大草書，　存不及十字。第三石兪典園書，記云：「西屋稍　，則凡寺中舊碑，咸植於是，以文待詔所書張懿孫詩，今已殘缺，屬余補書而重刻焉。」詩三行，每行十字，跋三行，每行十八字，草書，有陰側，跋云：「寒山寺舊有文待詔所書唐張繼楓橋夜泊一詩，歲久漫漶，光緒丙午筱石中丞於寺中新葺數楹，屬余補書刻石。俞樾。「碑陰八行，行廿字，行書，題云：「唐張繼楓橋夜泊　　炙人口，惟次句江楓漁火四字，頗有可疑，宋龔明之中吳紀聞作江村漁火，宋人舊籍可寳也。此詩宋王郇公曾寫以刻石，今不可見，明文待詔所書，亦漫漶，江下一字不可辨，筱石中丞屬余補書，姑從今本，然江村古本不可沒也，因作一詩，附刻以吿觀者。郇公舊墨久無存，待詔殘碑不可捫，幸有中吳紀聞在，千金一字是江村。兪樾。」碑側，一面五行，行三十二字，眞書，題云：「張懿孫此詩，傳世頗有異同，題中楓橋，舊誤作封橋，吳郡　續　已據　郇公所書訂正。詩　漁火，或誤作漁父，雍正問輯全唐詩，所據本如此，然注云：或作火，則亦不以作父者爲定本也。中吳紀聞載此詩作江村漁火，宋人舊為，足可依據，曲　太史作詩以證明之，今而後此詩定矣。光緒兩午，余移撫三吳，偶過此寺，嘆其荒廢，小爲修治，因刻張詩，並刻曲　詩，質世之讀此詩者。貴陽陳　　。」讀此知刻石年月，與江村漁火及楓橋之異同。傳此石於戰時爲日人所移置，今知不確，仍在寺中，從湖帆先生以山委張溥泉氏名與懿孫同，復請重書，竟成絕筆，　　先生曾記其事於本刊，湖帆已親爲勾勒，付名匠上石，元　　前後可以竣工，即送寺中，此爲張詩刻石第四石，張氏原續，則將贈諸國史館，作永久紀念，此不特文字之勝緣，抑又湖山佳話。</p>

<h3 id="c184">時間的揮霍 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>在國人値得誇耀的幾項「特長」中，除掉能够燒得一手好菜，刺繡得一手好花樣以外，擅於揮霍時間，似乎在世界民族史上，也値得大書特書。筆者嘗至某郵票代辦處（並非郵局），購買郵票，在櫃外約摸等了半句鐘模樣，才挨到我至窗口，而那位職員正在仔細細的寫一個信封，並不是我誇大的說法，他足是費了十五分鐘，才寫完十五個胡桃般的大字。我却已在櫃外接連看了三次手錶，等得不耐煩了。</p>
<p>可怪的是：國人對於什麽都知道珍惜，如愛惜字紙，愛惜衣服，愛惜米粒等，獨於愛惜時間，雖有「一寸光陰一寸金」的諺語，幾曾見人家將時間視同「　寳」？一遇空閑（實際上也許是積壓正事後騰出的時間），大家都在看報聊天中消磨了。</p>
<p>又有些人自奉甚儉。我相信一定有人因爲乘不到電車或公共汽車，而從靜安寺徒步走到新世界，或是從善鐘路走到八仙橋的。固然，他節省了一筆車資，但是他爲了省錢，却耗去不少時間。他如能利用這些時間，鍛鍊身體，草擬新計劃，在實驗室中工作，閱讀有益書報等，該是怎樣能加速他個人與事業的成功。何况時間更是失而不可復得的東西呢！</p>
<p>誠然，社會上不乏「安步當車」論者。我想他們對於花費時間，正太慷慨了。就筆者所知在社會上稍有地位的親友而言，他們對於任何事都有精密計算，而於車資等小節却不斤較量，這決不是他們的示圖，蓋亦深諳「充分利川時間」之旨而已。</p>
<p>說來也許令人難信，另有些時候，我們還花了錢去揮霍時間。我好容易排隊買到一張戲票，或出高價在黑市購得後，發現那是一齣不値得一看的戲，便有這種感覺。我想凡是在任何賭博中輸錢的，或有同感。</p>
<p>其實，時間的値得寳貴，往往有關個人事業或國家的興亡得失。遇有重要關頭，難免差之「分秒」，失之「千古」。頃讀美國人某氏所寫專供金融業從業員讀的一篇文章，內稱，有一位跑街，擬拉攏某富豪在銀行中開立往來戶，心中稍一猶豫，延挨了一天，再去踵門訪問，誰知這位富豪突患急病去世了。這一篇文章，雖係針對銀行員而發，兼可供一般讀者警惕，在個人的奮鬥中，只要您略進一步，也許成功之果，就給他八捷足先得。可不懼哉！</p>

<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>古人有一句話：一意誠志堅，金石爲開。「這是敎人做事努力前進的意思。記得古書里有一則故事，好像是說李白吧，他少年時遊手好閑，不務上進，有一個老嫗知道他是大才，見他這樣不知自愛，甚爲替他可　，爲要使他醒悟起見，於是天天在門前把一根鐵杵在石上　着。李白見老嫗天天在　鐵杵，覺得奇怪，便問她　作何用？老　答稱要把鐵杵磨成針。李白聽了大爲感動，乃痛改前非，力圖上進，終於名聞天下，永垂不朽。</p>
<p>列子渴問篇述愚公移山的故事：「太行王屋二山，方七百里，高萬仭，本在冀州之南，河陽之北。北山愚公者，年且九十，面山而居，懲山北之寒，出人之迂也，聚空而謀曰。吾與汝畢力平險，指通豫南，達於漢陰可乎？雜然相計。其妻　疑曰：以君之力，曾不能損魁父之立，如太行王屋何？　　置土石？雜曰：投諸渤海之尾，陰土之北。遂率子孫荷担者三夫，叩石墾壤，箕畚運於渤海之尾。鄰人京城氏之孀妻有遺男，始齔，跳往助之。寒者易節，始一反焉。河曲智叟笑而止之曰：甚矣汝之不慧，以殘年餘力，曾不能毁山之一毛，共如土石何？北山愚公長息曰：汝心之固，固不可徹，曾不若嬬妻弱子。雖我之死，有子存　。子又生孫，孫又生子，子又有子，子又有孫子子孫孫，無窮匱也。而山不加增，何苦而不平？河曲智叟亡以應。操蛇之神聞之，　其不已也，吿之於帝，帝感其誠，侖夸蛾氏二子負二山，一厝朔東，一厝雍南，自此冀之南，漢之陰，無隴斷　。」</p>
<p>這一類　勵志氣，敎人努力的話，初無可厚非。孟子引　淵曰：「舜何人也，予何人也，有為者亦若是。」這是說：只要盡力等善，人人皆可成為聖人，也是勸人努力上進之意。只是這一類的話頗足使人誤解，以爲只要有毅力，天下事無不可爲者，初不必再衡量自己的才具。吾意：做事沒有毅力固不行，可是單憑毅力，而不量力而行，亦有不當：不容易得到最佳的效果。努力似也應該選擇適當的方向進行。「天生我才必有用」，這話我們應該寄以宗敎性的信仰，但是不宜把意義擴大而爲：天下任何事我都幹得來。</p>
<p>即以北山愚公一事來說，以九十高齡的衰翁，要想把方七百里高萬似的山移去，其志誠可嘉，可是如果沒有「帝感其誠」「這麽一轉，實在是一個大大的悲劇。愚公決意以子子孫孫十百代的人力時間去移掉萬仭之山，我們雖不能斷定其一定不成，然而以十百代十子孫孫的精力時間盡注於移山一事，不能去做其他適當的工作，豈非大可惋惜？再說那老嫗磨杵的故事：如果我們所需的針都靠她這種方法去製造，第一，太糟塌鋼鐵，第二，太耗費時間，實在是不很經濟的。至於在李白方面，他見了大受感動，立志上進，却也還是無關於實實在在的國計民主。要是李白有機械發明天才，見了老嫗這種勞而無功的工作，便該去改進鑄針的方法，再進而發明縫衣機器，這才比較於民生有買益些。</p>
<p>可是那些也無非題外的話。總之我們必須認淸「人非萬能」這一點，總該裁量自己的才能，去做合適的工作，這才於人於己，兩得裨益。但看孟子雖說「舜亦人也，予亦人也」一類的話，同時他却也說：「或勞心，或勞力；勞心者治人，勞力者治於人；治於人者食人，治人者食於人。」足見他並不眞呌人人去做治人的舜，不然的話，大家做了勞心的舜，那時根本不再須要「治」的一事倒還在其次，最困難一點是：沒有了食人的勞力者，那時大家又吃什麼去呢？那眞成了「枵腹從公」了。孟子「熒心勞力，治人治於人」這一段話，很足使人誤解了起反感。實則孟子的所謂「治」初非「六老爺升堂」式的治，或禁止這取締那「仰各週知」式的治，更非戚再玉大將軍或俆繼莊大老爺那樣金鈔涓滴歸私式的治，却是指把國事整理得有條不紊，是「爲世除害，爲禁興利」式的治。這種「治人」的工作，認眞幹起來，委實也不能說怎麽「寫意」的。反之，只要「治人」的工作幹得好，勞力者縱使終年四季勞了力去食治人的勞心者亦是衷心誠服，不見得會如何辛苦。孟子勞心勞力的話，簡言之，無非「分工合作」之意，於理是可通的。今人之患，在於有太多的人木問問自己的才具，一味想：「有爲者亦若是。」這樣的有爲，以至於極，可以弄到大家沒飯吃完結。</p>
<p>「努力」是不錯的，可是前已說過，總須選擇一個州適當的方向才是。不然的話，那便是精力的浪費，這種精力的浪費，對於自己是一種痛苦，於社會是一種損失。須知「殺鷄用牛刀」是與「殺牛用裁紙刀」同樣不合宜的。比方木材：杉木有杉木的用處，洋松有洋松的用處，柳安有柳安的用處，柚木有柚木的用處。該用某種木材的不用某種木料，不該用某種木材的偏用了某種木材，結果一方面是木材的浪費，另一方面是成品的不合式。莊子郭象注說：「夫質小者，所資不待大，則質大者，所用不得小矣。故理有至分，物有完極，各足稱事，共濟一也。」又說：「物各有宜，苟得其宜，安往而不逍遙也。」又說：「夫大小雖殊，而放於自得之塲，則物任其性，事稱其能，各當其分，逍遙一也，　容勝負於其問哉。」又說：「夫外不可求而求之，臂以圓學方，以魚慕鳥耳！」</p>
<p>「物任其性，事稱其能，各當其分」，這該是我們的理想。舉”四顧，今日的實况離這條標準實在太遠了，柳安在充洋松用，松木在作柚木用，魚在慕島，用了圓規在畫方格。今日人才的分配，恰如「亂點鴛鴦　，這種人才的浪費，實在是很可惜的。對於這種「亂點鴛鴦譜」的局面，我們極需要來一次認眞的校正，予以適切的「調整」。我們的口號是二</p>
<p>人稱其職，</p>
<p>才　其用。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battle Unfolds in Anshan Urban Area; Air Force Assists Garrison in Hand-to-Hand Combat with Bandits; National Army Concentrates in Western Liaoning, Situation Improves <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 19th] After a week of offensive and defensive battles in Anshan, bandits broke into the city on the 18th, immediately launching street fighting. Fierce battles erupted in the Tiexi Steel Smelting Plant, Rail Steel Plant, and various machine casting factories. The fighting reached a climax at night. On the 19th, the Air Force repeatedly flew over the urban area to assist in the battle. The garrison is currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the bandits. Contact was maintained with this location until the afternoon, with the fiercest fighting underway in the evening.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In the Battle of Anshan, the bandits, with a main force or part of it from five columns, namely the Second, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth, totaling about 50,000 troops, began attacking outlying strongholds on the night of the 16th. They then completed the encirclement and bombarded the city with over thirty artillery pieces. After seven days of fierce fighting, the battle has entered its final stage.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Amidst the tense situation in southern Liaoning, a new situation is brewing in western Liaoning. National Army troops are massing in a certain area, and it is widely believed that the situation in the Rehe-Western Liaoning corridor will soon change. Icebreakers are gathering in Huludao and Yingkou (Yingkou has thawed). The National Army in Yingkou is also shelling the ice surface in the harbor to facilitate navigation. The bandits in Liaoyang are showing signs of wavering. Communist bandits are also gathering in Xinmin and Dahushan, with a portion heading south to reinforce Goubangzi. On the 18th, over one column of Communist bandits had gathered between Goubangzi and Beizhen, and they continue to amass. To prevent the National Army from advancing eastward, the Communist bandits intend to strike the Daling River again. The situation along the Daling River has been extremely tense at night in recent days. The National Army between the Daling River and Jinzhou is currently strengthening its defenses. The First and Tenth Columns of bandits and another bandit unit in western Shenyang are now gathering in the Kaiyuan area of northern Shenyang, with intentions to probe Tie嶺.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Turkish Newspaper Reveals Soviet Conspiracy: Encouraging the Chinese Communists to Seize Shenyang and Establish a Red Capital; Northeast's Seriousness No Less Than Germany and Greece <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 18th] The Turkish Democratic Party's official newspaper, "Power," stated: The Soviet Union's most important expansion plan at present lies in communizing China. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party is plotting to seize Shenyang and make it their red capital. The newspaper continued: If Shenyang falls into the hands of the Communist Party, the entire Northeast of China will be controlled by the Communist Party. Since losing their old base in Yan'an, the Communist Party has not had a fixed capital. Therefore, they are now plotting to establish a new red capital in Shenyang. From our point of view, Germany and Greece seem to be the powder kegs of the Third World War, but we must not forget the China problem. To date, the Communist Party in China has consistently received Soviet equipment more than the aforementioned two countries. Moreover, the Communist Party-controlled areas of China border the Soviet Union, unfortunately making the situation in China even darker than before. The competitive and antagonistic situation created by the United States and the Soviet Union in China is more serious and larger in scale than in any other region of the world. The Soviet Union's support and equipping of the Chinese Communist Party may be the most important item in the Kremlin's foreign expansion plan, its development is serious and affects world peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 19th] The National Army in this area is quite uneasy about the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea. According to an official, the Soviet Union will turn Korea into the Yugoslavia of Asia. Both official and unofficial sources deeply believe that this new development may trigger active assistance from Korea to the Chinese Communists, especially in the Northeast, and it is feared that the Chinese Communists may thus acquire an air force.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 19th] The Peiping Northeast Native Association hosted Ma Zhanshan and others at the European and American Alumni Association at 2:00 PM on the 19th, with over a hundred people in attendance, including Ma Zhanshan, Xing'an Chairman Wu Huanzhang, and Ma Yi. During the gathering, in addition to Ma explaining his mission to the capital upon summons, he also responded to the request of fellow Northeast natives to present three points to the central government: (1) Expedite the increase of troops and restore civilian armed forces; (2) Increase food sources; (3) Improve the Northeast economy and stabilize the exchange rate between circulating certificates and legal tender. Ma also stated that he would not return north if his objectives were not achieved in the capital. He reviewed the reasons for the failure in the Northeast, stating that the military and civilians could not cooperate. To save the Northeast in the future, it is necessary to organize the people and take root in the Northeast. Finally, he emphasized that without the Northeast, there is no North China; without North China, there is no China, his words were extremely impassioned.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 19th] General Ma Zhanshan told the Associated Press exclusively on the 9th that 300,000 of his old troops were "stranded" in the uninhabited areas of the Northeast. If the government were to arm them, he was prepared to lead these 300,000 men to fight the Communist bandits in their homeland. He said that if the Northeast National Army could hold out for "two or three months," he could equip and organize his troops within that time, and this plan could change the situation in the Northeast. He also said that the Communist Party's rear today is under the control of the Northeast landlords. After being purged by the Communist Party, they united and fought for survival as Red Beards, but they are not really Red Beards. "Their total number is between 300,000 and 500,000. If the government reaches out, they will all submit."</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 19th] The Communists have launched offensive actions in central Shanxi. The movements of bandit troops are all directed towards Da Ning, Yonghe, and Xi County in central Shanxi. The First Column of bandits, originally in northern Shaanxi, was discovered. The Eighth Column of bandits, Wang Zhen's four brigades, was discovered near Anze's Prefectural City. They advanced northeast from Linfen on the 15th. The bandits from Jingle are pressing towards the northwest of Yangqu. The bandits from Wutai are moving west to Dingxiang. In total, they amount to over 100,000 troops. The authorities attach great importance to this movement. Guo Zongfen, Chief of Staff of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, met with reporters on the afternoon of the 18th and said: There were originally 60,000 bandits in central Shanxi, and recently, 150,000 have moved towards central Shanxi. The bandits' tactics are nothing more than seizing cities and harassing, with the aim of seizing grain, capturing laborers, and sabotage. The National Army, in order to protect grain, protect laborers, and protect the government, has decided to conduct a large-scale military-civilian exercise as a defense of central Shanxi. We have the convenience of railway transport, and the bandits will be severely attacked if they come.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 19th] Last week's editorial in the London Times commented on the policies of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, stating that there was not much difference. The newspaper believes that the policies of both parties seek one-party dictatorship, cannot escape the implications of nationalism, and are unwilling to have a democratic political system. The only difference lies in the class interests they represent and the different people who support them. A Central News Agency reporter visited Wu Tiecheng regarding this matter and asked him to comment. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, and Bei Zuyi met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorpe for more than an hour this afternoon to discuss the U.S. aid to China proposal. The two also discussed with Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the U.S. Department of State, for 25 minutes. Ambassador Gu stated that the content of this conversation involved the general points of the aid to China plan and related supplementary information. However, Gu did not disclose the detailed content of the conversation. He expressed satisfaction with the fact that the long-delayed aid to China plan has now been submitted to Congress and hoped that the plan would be approved soon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese Technical Advisory Group, said that President Truman's message to Congress on aid to China was "good in scope." After arriving here, he submitted China's recommendations to the State Department for reference. When asked if he was satisfied with this, Bei replied, "Yes, and no." Bei was unwilling to explain the content of his recommendations to the State Department, only saying that the amount of aid proposed by Truman was not as much as China wanted. When asked if the amount proposed by Truman was sufficient to achieve its designated goals, Bei replied, "No amount is too large for China, the current amount only satisfies part of our hope." When asked if the amount proposed by Truman could be satisfactory to China's needs, Bei replied, "It depends on how the detailed measures are implemented." Bei also stated that his recommendations to the State Department involved reforming China's monetary system, but he was unwilling to express his opinion on Truman's failure to mention this matter. Bei is now seeking instructions from the National Government while continuing to negotiate with the State Department. His future actions will depend on instructions from Nanjing.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] After President Truman requested Congress on the 18th to pass a limited economic aid to China plan of $570 million, Republican spokesmen immediately criticized the plan as "inadequate" because it did not include military assistance. The President acknowledged in his special message that his recommendations could do no more than delay China's economic disintegration, and carefully avoided requesting military assistance for Chairman Chiang in the anti-Communist civil war. This omission was severely criticized by Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Bridges is the strongest proponent in Congress for military and economic aid to China. He said: China's post-war difficulties have gone beyond the scope that economic aid can reverse. He urged people to pay attention to General Wedemeyer, former presidential envoy, who strongly urged his Appropriations Committee to provide Chairman Chiang with military supplies. He said: "If the United States allows China to fall into the hands of the Communists due to negligence during the same period, then the billions of dollars spent to prevent the spread of communism in Europe will be meaningless." Bridges continued: The United States should send a strong and direct representative to protect its interests in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Former Republican Congressman from New York, Fish, suggested on the 18th that Allied Commander MacArthur should fly back to Washington soon to testify in favor of aid to China. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee: "If our aid to China is delayed until half a year, until June, it will be too late to be effective."</p>

<h3 id="e21">Ambassador Stuart's Letter to the Chinese People: Economic Aid to China Provides an Opportunity for Revival, but the Main Strength Still Lies with the Chinese People <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Nanjing, 18th] United States Ambassador to China, Stuart, issued a letter to the Chinese people this afternoon. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>You have learned from President Truman's statement to Congress that the United States intends to help the Chinese people. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to explain to you the various objectives that determine the United States' policy toward China and the problems it raises. Because I was born in your country, grew up in your country, and am no less concerned about your country's welfare than you are, I would like to try to explain it from this standpoint.</p>
<p>Fortunately, what the United States government and people expect of China is also what all sincere patriotic Chinese people are now striving for: China's freedom and independence, domestic peace and prosperity, and the establishment of a truly modern democratic government. This is all that we Americans expect.</p>
<p>The common goal is how to help the civilians who have suffered the most from the civil war since the victory of the War of Resistance. What they ask for is to enjoy peace and engage in productive activities under a government that cares about their welfare.</p>
<p>Specifically, the focus of the problem is to improve the welfare of the general public and protect them from the threats of extreme reactionary selfish elements and extreme radical violent revolutionary means. Both of these groups are well-organized, and both believe that party and personal interests are far more important than the interests of the poor people.</p>
<p>We Americans believe in democracy and believe that if the time is right and there is enough time, democracy will surely prevail in China. From a negative point of view, a democratic government can guarantee the people's freedom in their daily lives and freedom from fear. From a positive point of view, it can also create an environment in which wiser and more progressive leaders can educate and assist ordinary citizens in many ways to understand their obligations and rights in a democratic life, and put it into practice in accordance with the spirit of the rule of law, without following personal preferences, and through constitutional procedures. According to the lessons of Chinese history, the masses are willing to follow wise leaders who they trust and who have good character. If the old Chinese democratic methods are used as modern constitutional procedures, then the corruption or incompetence in the national, provincial, and local governments can be gradually eliminated, and replaced by people who are freely elected by the people to perform public duties for the public good.</p>
<p>I have been with Chinese students for a long time, so I deeply understand their patriotic ideals. Whether they have graduated, served in the government, engaged in education, run businesses, held other jobs, or are still studying at school, they should lead by example in this patriotic work. With their selfless example, they will be able to overcome the other extreme of only knowing how to be loyal to the party, not tolerating other political beliefs, using violent means, attempting to destroy public and private property, and inflicting the terror of robbery and war on innocent people in order to achieve their tyrannical goals.</p>
<p>We Americans, under the leadership of Mr. Marshall, have done our best to prevent the development of the current situation and the suffering it has caused to the Chinese people. However, in view of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples and the firm belief that the economic welfare of the Chinese people will promote world happiness, we intend to use the Economic Aid to China Plan to give the Chinese government and people another opportunity to begin building China's economic revival and stability.</p>
<p>But the responsibility for the work, at its core, still lies with the Chinese people themselves. No matter how much material assistance the United States provides and how many expert advisors there are, it will not be enough to meet the needs of China's political stability and economic revival. The main strength is still the Chinese people, and there must also be a sincere determination to sacrifice oneself for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>The meaning of freedom and democracy should not be misunderstood, but now it has been confused by various interpretations. Under a totalitarian system, there is no possibility of freedom of thought. Anyone who intends to think freely will either be controlled or purged.</p>
<p>A democratic government is not only a government for the people but also a government by the people. In this democratic spirit, the people should constantly supervise the government with enlightened public opinion to prevent officials from abusing their power. Therefore, there must be freedom of speech and publication, and freedom to freely interview or fairly report news. In the works of a totalitarian system, these freedoms cannot exist. On the contrary, the news becomes a tool of scientific propaganda, using infinite slander and repeated disregard for the truth to extend its efficacy.</p>
<p>The dangers facing China today can only be overcome by the joint efforts of all selfless citizens. For this, there must be vision, courage, and determination. We hope that China's patriotic elements who are loyal to freedom, together with all sectors of the country, will take constructive and gradual steps to promote the unity and peaceful progress of the entire country.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart.</p>
<p>There are No Currency Loan Negotiations Between China and the United States</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Ambassador Stuart held a press conference at his official residence at 3:40 p.m. on the 19th, releasing his "Letter to the Chinese People" in his personal capacity and answering reporters' questions. He said that 510 million of the loan to China could be used to purchase important materials such as food, fuel, and machinery, while the other 60 million would be used for selected construction projects, but it was not specified that it must be used for the restoration of the Yuehan Railway. As for the purchase of military equipment, it is not within the scope of this loan. However, if China has sufficient financial resources, it can purchase the imported goods that it urgently needs. Ambassador Stuart affirmed that there are currently no negotiations between China and the United States regarding loans for the stabilization or reform of China's currency system.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Agricultural Loans Will Be Opened Ahead of Schedule <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The person in charge of the Four Joint Offices said: The Four Joint Council will reconvene on the 21st, and the issue of opening up loans can be decided. Agricultural loans are now imminent and can be processed ahead of schedule. Zhang Jia'ao will report on the agricultural loan plan at the meeting. The date of opening up industrial loans has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Another cable] Supervisors Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, Li Xiaoting, and others have made suggestions to the government regarding the opening up of loans for legitimate industry and commerce, advocating that in order to maintain the survival of legitimate industry and commerce, industrial loans should be opened up conditionally, but after the loans are opened, efforts should be made to avoid the abuses of past loans.</p>

<h3 id="e23">American Aid and Self-Help <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The world-renowned U.S. aid to China plan was finally submitted to Congress by President Truman on the 18th of this month. This presidential message, which is thousands of words long, is a historical document, whether in terms of Sino-U.S. relations or Far Eastern peace. We have repeatedly read the full text of the message and summarized the main points of the entire article as follows: (1) Emphasize the sincere friendship between China and the United States, and express sympathy for the difficulties and tests that China has suffered over the years; (2) Request Congress to approve $570 million as the aid to China plan before June 30, 1949; (3) To implement this aid to China plan, China and the United States should sign an agreement, which will be subject to various conditions; (4) If the United States believes that the assistance it provides is not being handled in accordance with the agreement, or if the United States believes that the Chinese government's policies are not in line with the U.S. use of assistance to help it achieve economic self-sufficiency, then the United States will naturally reserve the right to stop assistance; (5) Although the U.S. aid to China plan is the best way for the United States to take at present, China's revival still depends entirely on its own self-help.</p>
<p>After reading President Truman's message, our first feeling is that the U.S. policy toward China, whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, whether it is the late President Roosevelt or the current President Truman, or even the future Democratic Party president, is consistent in principle, with only slight differences in emphasis and urgency. Before President Truman proposed this aid to China plan, everyone saw that the U.S. aid to China was all talk and no action, and they could not help but feel disappointed. Therefore, many people who had a half-baked understanding of the United States speculated about President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, saying that the U.S. foreign policy was "silent first and then Asian," or that the United States intended to support Japan in the Far East to counter the Soviet Union. Now that we have seen President Truman's message, we can completely understand it. President Truman not only cherishes the sincere friendship between China and the United States, but also deeply sympathizes with China's unfortunate experiences in recent years. At the same time, he recognizes China's greatness, not only because it is a vast country with a large population, but also because it has a long history and culture and has become an important factor in international relations. China's stability, strength, and progress are of great importance to the security and peace of the Pacific and the world. President Truman's understanding of China can represent the common view of the U.S. government and the public, which makes us more confident that no matter what the outcome of this year's general election, even if President Truman fails to be re-elected and the leader of another party becomes the master of the White House, the U.S. aid to China policy will not change. Therefore, we cannot but express our gratitude for President Truman's good intentions, and it is only reasonable that we should no longer have any dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>However, if we put aside theory and talk about the actual effectiveness of this plan, we cannot help but express considerable doubt as to whether President Truman's aid to China plan will be effective and achieve his intended goals. Because President Truman intends to allocate US$570 million within eight years to aid China, the purpose is to give the Chinese government time to breathe in the midst of economic decline, so that it can find ways to establish a more stable economic situation. However, after studying the content and procedures of the U.S. aid to China plan and looking at China's actual situation, although we are not defeatists, we still do not believe that US$570 million is as powerful as a god. What's more, in terms of the amount, the amount of aid to China is only US$57 million. Even if it can be quickly approved by Congress, China will not be able to obtain substantial assistance until after July 1, and it will take a year to obtain the full amount of US$570 million. In view of the urgency of China's needs, the U.S. aid to China plan is not only insufficient, but also too late in terms of time. We really dare not make a hasty judgment on its effectiveness.</p>
<p>In terms of China's current situation, economic difficulties are certainly the most serious problem facing China. President Truman also said in his message: "The Chinese government and people are still suffering from the double pressure of civil war and rapid economic decline. The difficult situation caused by Japan's occupation and blockade during the eight years of the War of Resistance has now been made more serious by internal strife. The continued obstruction and destruction of major transportation routes by the Communist army has further deepened the losses suffered by transportation and production equipment during the War of Resistance." However, we still cannot but tell President Truman and the U.S. government and the public that China's current problems are not only economic problems, but also military and political problems, which are mutually causal with economic problems. If we do not understand the truth of the matter and want to treat the symptoms but not the root cause, it will not be the way a good doctor treats a disease. President Truman also said: "The United States is extremely concerned about the continued economic decline in China; we hope that the environment in China will enable U.S. assistance to be effective and used in a constructive way for construction and reconstruction. We may be able to help China alleviate the current economic decline, so that the Chinese government has another opportunity to take the necessary steps to establish a more stable economic environment." If U.S. aid to China is limited to this and no other steps are taken, then President Truman will be greatly disappointed. Therefore, Republican members of Congress pointed out that President Truman's aid to China plan did not include military aid and unanimously pointed out that this plan was "insufficient." For example, the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bai Liqi, said: "China's difficulties after the war have exceeded the scope that economic aid can reverse the overall situation."</p>
<p>However, the United States is a democratic country, and all domestic and foreign policies must be based on public opinion. President Truman's aid to China plan is still subject to discussion in Congress. If members of Congress have opinions, they can not only express them freely, but also amend and supplement them. What's more, the amount of US$570 million specified by President Truman is also a provisional number, which can be increased at any time. We hope that the members of the U.S. Congress will recognize the seriousness of the situation in China and urge the government to step up the work of aiding China at any time, especially to assist China in reforming its currency system.</p>
<p>Finally, we still have to say a few words to the Chinese government. President Truman's aid to China plan has been proposed. Judging from the political atmosphere in Washington these days, it will undoubtedly be approved by both the House and the Senate. It can also be asserted that the amount of aid to China will only increase and will not decrease. We should certainly know how to be grateful for the continuous assistance from the United States, but the most important thing is not to forget the basic national policy of "self-help": we must never have the slightest dependence on foreign aid. During the War of Resistance, let alone, just take the period after the victory as an example, the U.S. aid has been flowing in continuously, and it cannot be said that it is not much, but we have not been able to use this precious assistance as a starting point for national construction and revival. This is really a major mistake in our country, which has disappointed our friendly countries and led foreigners to criticize us for being corrupt and incompetent. The past cannot be changed, but the future can be pursued. We must change the past political style, work hard to govern, rely on our own efforts, and make good use of this precious U.S. aid. Whether it is materials or U.S. dollars, we must use it completely for the revival of our country's economy, and we must not waste a single bit. We must know that only "self-help" can make U.S. aid effective!</p>

<p>(Continued from the previous page) Section 4 A The President may provide aid to China in the form or procedure prescribed in Section 3 without requiring reimbursement, or may make loans in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Section B. The National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems will serve as the President's advisor when the President decides whether such assistance is without reimbursement or is in the form of a loan, and determines the term of such loans. Whether any assistance given to China for the purpose of achieving the objectives of this Act should require China to repay, whether it should be repaid in money or other consideration, and if so required, what the conditions should be, will depend on China's ability to repay without jeopardizing the completion of the objectives of this Act? Assuming that it is decided that China can only be required to repay a portion of the assistance under this Act, then, where practicable, the prices specified in Section 3, paragraph A, clause (1), subparagraph 2 should be used as repayment.</p>
<p>B When it is decided to provide assistance in the form of a loan under the provisions of this Act, the President shall allocate to the Export-Import Bank of Washington the funds to be used for this purpose. The Bank, without being bound by the provisions of the Export-Import Bank Act (Public Law 59-529), as amended in 1945, shall extend and manage loans in accordance with the President's guidance and the terms prescribed. The administrative expenses necessarily incurred by the Export-Import Bank in handling such loans may be reimbursed. The Bank shall deposit in the U.S. Treasury all odd sums received from the repayment of principal and interest on such loans.</p>
<p>Loans extended by the Export-Import Bank of Washington with funds allocated to the Bank by the President shall not be counted in determining whether the Bank's principal loans and guarantees have reached the prescribed limits at any time, as determined under Section 7 of the Export-Import Bank Act (Public Law 59-529), as amended in 1945.</p>
<p>Section 5 Before any assistance may be made available to China under the powers under this Act, an agreement shall be entered into between China and the United States, subject to the restrictions and provisions of this Act, in which China shall provide guarantees to achieve the objectives of this Act, to improve commercial relations with China, and such other guarantees as the President may deem necessary.</p>
<p>A Effective use of any materials authorized under this Act, and the pricing and terms of distribution of such materials, shall be based on the principle of promoting the objectives of this Act.</p>
<p>B To the extent possible, initiate financial, monetary, budgetary and administrative measures to create a more stable currency situation and to enhance China's ability to achieve economic self-reliance.</p>
<p>C When any materials or services are provided to China by any means interfered with by this Act other than on a payment basis, an equivalent amount of Chinese legal tender shall be entered in a special account under terms agreed upon by the Governments of China and the United States. This special account, together with the unused portion of the deposits made by China in accordance with Section 6 of the Resolution on Relief to the Peoples of War-Affected Countries (Public Law 84, 80th Congress), must be reserved for the purposes agreed upon by the Governments of China and the United States, and the balance remaining on this account on June 30, 1949 must be used in China for purposes agreed upon by the Governments of China and the United States, and approved by this Act or the Joint Resolution.</p>
<p>D At least every quarter after the date of the agreement, a complete list of all actions taken by the Government of China under the agreement shall be published, including the use of funds, materials and services obtained under this Act, and such list shall be transmitted to the United States.</p>
<p>E Promptly provide relevant reports at the request of the United States to assist the United States in determining the nature and scope of future actions under this Act.</p>
<p>R Use all media in China (including government wireless) to continuously publish reports to inform the ultimate consumer of the use, source, nature and quantity of all materials authorized under this Act.</p>
<p>G Materials provided under the authority of this Act shall not be exported or permitted to be transported from China without the consent of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>H Strive to obtain the highest possible production and distribution of local products; no measures shall be taken to sell, distribute or use materials included under this Act that are sufficient to reduce the supply of local products or to reduce the sources of supply from countries other than the United States.</p>
<p>I Permit representatives of the U.S. Government, including congressional committees approved by the House or Senate, and representatives of U.S. newspapers and radio stations, to observe and report on the distribution and use of commodities obtained under this Act and the special items prescribed in Section G of this section.</p>
<p>J Facilitate the sale of materials to the United States for stockpiling purposes, at mutually agreeable times and on reasonable terms. Such materials are those needed due to a lack of or possible lack of resources in the United States itself; at the same time, such materials are also available in China after proper estimation of reasonable demand for domestic use and commercial export to China.

<h3 id="e25">The Difference Between the Policies of the Kuomintang and the Communists (Continued from the previous page) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu said first that the newspaper mistakenly believed that the Kuomintang's one-party rule in the past 20 years was the same as the Communist Party's class dictatorship, which obviously ignored the propositions and efforts of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the creator of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu also said that although there were Communist rebellions and Japanese aggression in the past 20 years, the Kuomintang never relaxed its preparations for the implementation of democratic politics in the midst of internal and external troubles. Before the war, the National Assembly Hall was already built in Nanjing, and during the war, the National Assembly Hall was also built in Chongqing. This alone is enough to prove that the Kuomintang will never regard one-party dictatorship as a rule. The Communist Party, however, is unwilling to participate in the National Assembly, opposes the Constitution, and does not allow the existence of opposition parties.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu finally pointed out that The Times published a report from its Beijing correspondent last Wednesday, in which it described the Communist Party's tyranny in China, saying that "the Communist Party only seeks to control the lives of all the people with a one-party class dictatorship, even to the extent of the people's family private lives." This practical observation is a perfect explanation of the difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou, 19th dispatch] The rice market here has not calmed down from the price surge. Today, all stalls have raised prices by 20,000 yuan. The head of the Social Affairs Section of the county government is stationed in the market all day to oversee transactions. However, the grain merchants turn a blind eye, continuing to whisper and trade on the black market. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo has returned to the city from Chenmu, where he was leading the suppression of bandits. Concerned about the people's food supply, he has decided to go to the rice market tomorrow morning to summon the grain merchants for a reprimand and thoroughly investigate the black market situation.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin, 19th dispatch] Due to the high prices in the Wuxi market, the rice industry has delayed opening for business. The off-market price is over 2 million yuan. The county government implemented emergency measures on the 19th, setting a price limit of 1.7 million yuan for white rice and limiting each person to one dou (a unit of dry measure). Officials have been dispatched to investigate everywhere. However, grain merchants claim a lack of reserves and hope to open up supply sources in order to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>[Our Changshu, 19th dispatch] The rice price surge here is quite fierce. The market remained deadlocked and unopened on the 19th, and the black market even exceeded the 2.2 million yuan mark. The county government is making efforts to suppress the rise and will, if necessary, sell off accumulated grain to curb it.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang, 19th dispatch] Price fluctuations in Zhenjiang are severe. Foreign indica rice opened at 2.1 million yuan today. Bean oil is 54,000 yuan per jin (a unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg). Sugar and foreign sundry goods continue to rise in price. Furthermore, the Zhenjiang Price Evaluation Council has recently approved an increase in pork prices to 46,000 yuan per jin and bean oil to 52,000 yuan per jin.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu, 19th dispatch] After the Bengbu grain market opened, grain prices suddenly surged wildly, causing public unrest and chaos. Long-grain rice is now knocking on the 4 million yuan mark. Wheat is at 3.75 million yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure) due to frenzied buying by flour mills, leading to an easing of credit. Flour prices have soared as a result, currently at 960,000 yuan per bag. The black market is rampant, and the prices of all other goods are soaring.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou, 19th dispatch] The rice price surge has not been curbed. San Tong machine-milled rice remains high, reaching 2.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou, 19th dispatch] Grain prices here soared wildly all day on the 18th, breaking through the 2 million yuan mark per 100 market jin (a unit of weight). Prices of all goods are skyrocketing, creating a truly terrifying situation.</p>

<p>私校学费二千亿 纷购金钞起风浪</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou, 19th dispatch] Due to the financial fluctuations in Shanghai and the impact of the current situation, turmoil has broken out again in the market here. The Hong Kong dollar has risen even more frantically, jumping from 337 to the 400 mark. Gold has also risen from 1,170 to 1,380. The prices of other goods have generally increased by 50 percent. According to Gao Fang, director of the Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau, this phenomenon is entirely caused by psychological factors. He recently received unconfirmed information that yesterday, the 18th, various private primary and secondary schools used the 200 billion yuan in tuition fees they had collected to purchase gold and foreign currency for storage in order to avoid losses, leading to a market where demand exceeds supply. He stated that he will thoroughly investigate this matter. He also stated that the bureau's research results after 50 days of operation in the Guangzhou financial market are: (A) Guangzhou is actually a receiving and payment port rather than a place for investment, so it provides no assistance to industry and commerce. (B) Credit is scarce, with daily bill exchanges totaling less than 500, in stark contrast to the expansion of credit in Shanghai. (C) The Hong Kong dollar's damage to the national currency is particularly severe. Industry and commerce are entirely based on the Hong Kong dollar, and the national currency has been relegated to the status of a subsidiary currency. The future is truly unimaginable. The bureau is currently addressing these issues to improve the situation.</p>

<p>家无积蓄恤金渺茫 长子韩永涵突自杀</p>
<p>[Our Beiping, 19th dispatch] Han Yonghan, the 15-year-old eldest son of Han Zengdong, the commander of the 88th Division of the 71st Army who died in the Battle of Siping last year, committed suicide with a pistol yesterday. Yonghan was a sophomore at Huilin High School in Beiping. After his father's death, he was extremely grief-stricken. Furthermore, the family had no savings, and there was no news of the only source of support, the pension. His mother had published an announcement in the Ta Kung Pao, questioning Chen Mingren, titled "General Chen Mingren, Please Take Note," which read: "We have received a letter from the adjutant's office of the current 71st Army stating that the pension for the late commander Han Zengdong of the former 88th Division was received during your tenure. We are unsure how this pension was handled and are extremely perplexed. If you are preserving it on our behalf, it has been more than half a year, and we are afraid that you are overburdened. We are sincerely grateful. Furthermore, the government provides pensions to commemorate heroes and support their families, not to be used for other purposes. Although we are orphans and widows, we are still capable of managing it ourselves and dare not presume upon your authority. We hereby publish this announcement to express our sincere thanks and request a reply as soon as possible." It was signed "Han Cao Lanfang." Many days passed without a response. Yonghan, already grieving his father's death, felt the hardship of the family's life and suddenly became disillusioned with life, committing suicide with a Browning pistol. The bullet entered from his right chest, but because the bullet was small, it did not exit. He was discovered and sent to Peking University Hospital, but he died due to excessive blood loss. Han's wife, Cao Lanfang, has two sons and three daughters. Yonghan was the eldest. Although young, he acted like an adult. Last year, he went to welcome his father's spirit in Panjin and did not sleep for three days and nights, suffering a mental blow. Today, he finally committed suicide due to grief and his circumstances, a truly tragic event.</p>

<p>Gao Youxin and his wife, Ms. He Lingling, at their wedding.</p>
<p>Air Force Tiger General: The Death of Gao Youxin</p>
<p>At 3:35 PM on February 13, "a great star fell on the railroad tracks east of Wuhu Bridge in Nanjing—a magnificent air hero, silently extinguished the sparks of life under the wheels of a train!</p>
<p>This is the tragedy of Gao Youxin. In the Air Force, Gao Youxin represents a respectable name. He was only 32 years old this year. Ever since he dedicated himself to the Air Force at the age of 19, he has always been the pride of the Air Force. He admired Gao Zhihang and was also known as "Little Gao Zhihang." He was brave, alert, passionate, and straightforward. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he created the most glorious record in the history of the Chinese Air Force: personally destroying over a hundred enemy aircraft, accumulating 275 combat merits, and receiving as many as 15 medals. He can be called a tiger general! After the victory, he did not rest and continued to sweep away the evil atmosphere for the motherland. He did not die in the sky fighting enemy bandits, but he died in an improper place, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Gao Youxin was born in a middle-class family in Jin County, Liaoning Province. He lost his father early and was raised by his widowed mother and his uncle, Gao Yongen. His mother was a devout Christian, and the spirit of Jesus's love influenced him in his youth. When the Battle of Gubeikou broke out in 1935 and Tianjin and Beiping were threatened, he had just graduated from the Tianjin Rotary Club Middle School and resolved to join the Air Force, believing that the Air Force was the best way to serve the country. He was only 19 years old at that time. Because he loved sports in school, he was very strong. On July 1 of that year, the Air Force Officer School recruited eighth-term students in Tianjin, and he was admitted in one fell swoop. On September 1, he enlisted in Nanjing for training. By August 1936, he was receiving elementary flight training at the Guangzhou Branch School. In April 1937, he was receiving advanced flight training in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. That year, on August 13, the Shanghai Battle broke out. Jianqiao Aviation School first moved to Nanchang, Jiangxi, then to Xiaogan, Hubei, and then to Liuzhou, Guangxi. In November, it arrived in Kunming to receive advanced flight training. He was flying a fighter plane, receiving training on one hand and serving on the other. On September 24, 1938, Japanese planes bombed Kunming for the first time. He had not yet graduated, but he flew a Hawk 3 fighter plane into the air to meet the enemy, demonstrating excellent performance and making a name for himself.</p>
<p>On December 1, 1938, he officially graduated from aviation school and was transferred to the Lanzhou Fighter Training Corps for training. In 1939, he was assigned to Chongqing as a second lieutenant in the Fourth Group. The Fourth Group was founded by Gao Zhihang and was also known as the "Zhihang Group." Gao Youxin, who was full of heroism, often expressed his ambition to others: "To be the second Gao Zhihang—"</p>
<p>He did not fail his ambition. Later facts proved that he was as great as Gao Zhihang; and summing up Youxin's life achievements, he even surpassed Zhihang. He always charged forward in every battle, making the enemy tremble with fear. In 1940, he was promoted to first lieutenant squad leader of the 21st Squadron of the Fourth Group, responsible for defense in Lanzhou. On one occasion, when enemy planes launched a large-scale attack, he piloted a Russian-made E15-3 fighter plane and shot down as many as three enemy planes, establishing a special merit. The name Gao Youxin became familiar to people all over the country.</p>
<p>In 1941, he was promoted to captain deputy squadron leader of the 21st Squadron due to meritorious service. He returned to Chongqing from Lanzhou to participate in the Battle of Defense of Greater Chongqing. On March 1 of that year, the enemy began using Zero fighter planes, which were superior in performance to the E15 and E16 models used by our country. Therefore, that period was when our Air Force was at its greatest disadvantage. Gao Youxin was wounded in an air battle on one occasion.</p>
<p>In 1942, the Fourth Group went to Kunming and then to India to receive American training, using the latest P-40 fighter planes, turning the disadvantage into an advantage and forcing the enemy's Zero fighters to dare not show their faces. At this time, Fu Youxin was already the captain of the 22nd Squadron of the Fourth Group, fighting alongside the American 14th Air Force led by Chennault, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces north and south of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Gao Youxin was promoted to major deputy group leader of the Fourth Group in 1943. On one occasion, while flying a plane to bomb the enemy forces in Henan, he was hit by enemy artillery fire and had to parachute once. Unfortunately, he parachuted into a communist-controlled area. At that time, the communists were still ostensibly "cooperating." However, the "cooperation" involved presenting conditions to the Air Force Headquarters, requiring a large sum of money as the price for allowing him to be redeemed. He was held under house arrest there for three months before returning to Chongqing.</p>
<p>He was injured three times and parachuted three times in his life. He always turned misfortune into good fortune.</p>
<p>Gao Youxin, who was young and had a great reputation, had a very tragic love life. In the spring of 1939, he met Ms. Liu Moran, a top student at Southwest Associated University. Ms. Liu was revered as the "Queen" at the university. Hero and beauty, love at first sight. In the summer of 1942, the wedding was held at the Lixing Society in Chengdu, and the guests gathered together, and many people envied them—but the creator is jealous, and more than two months after the wedding, the bride died of tuberculous meningitis. In addition to the grief of the groom, he disappeared from the entertainment venues and devoted all his fiery enthusiasm to his work. On the eve of victory in 1945, the United States invented the faster P-15 fighter plane, which was used to sweep through the enemy forces shaking in the north and south of the Yangtze River, and was invincible. This was the most prosperous era of our Air Force.</p>
<p>Victory! The whole country rejoiced. Gao Youxin welcomed the glory of victory and held his second wedding in Chongqing. The other party was Ms. He Lingling, a 17-year-old girl from Hunan, who was the granddaughter of He Jian, a member of the Central Committee. Soon after, the Fourth Group moved from Chongqing to Beiping, and the new couple visited the ancient capital together. In the winter of that year, the communist bandit He Long's troops launched a large-scale attack on Suiyuan and Baotou. Gao Youxin fought in the air and made another great contribution. Because of his bravery in combat, when the communist bandits in the Northeast launched a large-scale attack in the spring of 1946, the Northeast also needed him. He then went from Beiping to Shenyang. This time, Mrs. Gao did not go with him, and the tragedy was planted there!</p>

<p>[United Press, Louisville, 18th dispatch] Henderson, Secretary of State Marshall's senior advisor on Greek affairs, warned the Soviet Union and its satellite countries on the 18th that the United States would not stand idly by and allow Greece to fall victim to international communism. US officials went on to state that, if necessary, they would consider sending their own armed forces to Greece. He reported that the Administration would soon request Congress for greater military assistance to Greece and strongly implied that financial assistance alone would not be enough. He stated that communist guerrillas commit the most outrageous and even obscene acts every day. Unless these guerrillas are eliminated in the near future, the Marshall Plan will fail in Greece and be seriously threatened throughout Europe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th dispatch] Washington observers believe that Mr. Han's words are nothing less than a warning to Moscow and the Balkan countries that if they support the guerrillas in Greece, the US government will make equal efforts to support the Athens regime. Henderson also stated: "The United States will not stand idly by when foreign aggressors deprive Greece of its territorial integrity and political independence."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall warned that the effectiveness and even the existence of the United Nations depends on decisive action on the issue of the partition of Palestine. He declined to specify what action he believed the United Nations should take, but said that the US position was largely determined and that the US representative would present it when the Security Council begins debating the Palestinian issue. He confirmed that the US ban on the shipment of weapons to the Holy Land was under consideration, but would not be implemented.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin told MPs in the House of Commons that the defense of the city of Jerusalem was the responsibility of the UN organization, not the British government. He also reiterated that British troops would not participate in the implementation of the Palestine Partition Plan or any solution not jointly accepted by Jews and Arabs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th dispatch] British Colonial Secretary Jones told reporters here today that he expected the unrest in the Holy Land to worsen after Britain ends its mandate over Palestine on May 15. At that time, the Arabs will use force more openly to resist the partition. Jones also said that a widespread civil war would have broken out in Palestine long ago without British security forces stationed there. Britain has been striving to avoid conflict between Jews and Arabs from a position of impartiality. Britain has not been able to accept all the requests made by the United Nations to it because it must handle the important task of withdrawing from the Holy Land itself. The two main points that Britain cannot accept from the UN organization are the opening of Jewish immigration ports and the date of the UN Committee's arrival in the Holy Land. Britain is well aware that the opening of immigration ports will lead to more serious civil war. Asked whether Britain accepted the principle of needing international forces to implement the partition, Jones replied that he had warned the UN organization in October last year that the Arabs would oppose the partition, so the use of force to implement the partition was extremely necessary. Therefore, if the UN organization has the determination to implement its resolutions, it must be given appropriate military equipment. This matter should now be decided by the Security Council.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th dispatch] Iraqi representative Qari Di protested the plan to make Jerusalem an international zone at the UN Trusteeship Council today. He considered the UN General Assembly's plan to be illegal, and that the plan was only a suggestion, so it had no binding effect. If the Trusteeship Council proceeds to implement the plan, it will be a violation of the Charter and an infringement of the rights of stakeholders. He also pointed out the following points: (1) The UN Charter does not provide for a trusteeship system for Jerusalem; (2) Britain, as the mandatory power, has not submitted a trusteeship agreement; (3) The General Assembly therefore has no right to propose a trusteeship agreement; (4) The Trusteeship Council itself cannot be the trustee; the Trusteeship Council can only be the supervisor, and the trustee must be one or more countries. He believed that the Trusteeship Council has no right to deal with the plan of the international city of Jerusalem. The Iraqi delegation could not participate in this discussion, stated and then exited the meeting.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to meet with U.S. Ambassador to England, Douglas, today to discuss whether or not to include the Benelux countries in the Anglo-American-French discussions on the German problem. The Benelux countries all hope to fully participate in this conference, but British officials are opposed to their participation. If the Benelux countries are not invited, the realization of the Western European Union plan will inevitably suffer a blow. London officials revealed that the issue of whether or not these three countries will participate will not be decided before the Three-Power Conference convenes on Monday.</p>

<p>State Department Stops Issuing Export Licenses</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The State Department has announced a ban on the export from the United States of any ordnance, ammunition, or war materiel that has been sold by the government as scrap. The State Department's announcement stated: Before World War II, and during the period between the wars, individuals and companies in the United States sold weapons, ammunition, and war materiel that had been used in World War I and sold as scrap to foreign countries, placing the U.S. government in an extremely awkward position. In order to avoid a similar situation arising from the war materiel of World War II, the State Department has decided to no longer issue export licenses for any ordnance, ammunition, and war materiel that has been sold by the government as scrap.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Declaration by Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia: West German Plans Threaten Security; Advocate Continued Four-Power Control of Germany <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 18th] The foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia issued a declaration after a two-day meeting in Prague, protesting the unilateral solution being pursued in western Germany, stating that a West Germany as a separate political entity undermines the foundation of European security. The declaration also stated that dividing Germany is detrimental to its neighbors and also to Germany's peaceful progress. The declaration further protested the priority given to Germany in the Marshall Plan for reconstruction, demanded the fulfillment of the reparations claims of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, and solemnly warned that Germany has transformed from a center of chaos into a new tool of aggression. The three foreign ministers also decided to continue exchanging information and opinions on the German question.</p>
<p>The full text of the declaration, which is two thousand words long, states that the three countries share completely identical views on all issues concerning Germany. The development of the situation in Germany has deviated from the principles stipulated in Potsdam and Yalta, and Germany's recognition of these principles is a necessary condition for achieving peace in Europe. The division of Europe into two opposing blocs makes West Germany a tool of power politics and encourages the revival of disguised German nationalism and militarism. Such phenomena may become the source of the first attack on Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, and ultimately on the entire Europe. The governments of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia solemnly protest the violation of Allied obligations and actions taken without the approval of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and demand the full implementation of the provisions of the Potsdam and Yalta agreements regarding the exchange of views between the great powers and other Allied nations on the exercise of their authority in Germany. While the three governments recognize the importance of restoring Germany's normal economy, they are deeply concerned about the plan to prioritize the reconstruction of Germany at the expense of Western Europe, which could endanger the economy of Western Europe in peacetime. Giving priority to Germany's recovery runs counter to the principles of equality and justice and is intended to establish a West German state with vast military capabilities. The declaration continues, stating that the recent reduction in Czechoslovakia's and Yugoslavia's reparations program is insufficient to compensate for the losses suffered by the two countries due to German aggression. Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia were the first victim countries of Hitler's aggression, and in resolving the German problem, the most important interests of European countries must not be harmed; otherwise, Germany will transform from a center of chaos into a new tool of aggression. The three governments are deeply aware of the cooperation of the Allied nations during the war, acknowledge the contributions of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia in the war, and believe that four-power control of Germany, and consultation with Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia are the surest guarantee of lasting peace and security in Europe. The declaration also called for the punishment of war criminals and the cessation of propaganda by Germans returning to Germany that obstructs peace. Foreign Minister Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, Foreign Minister Modzelewski of Poland, and Foreign Minister Simić of Yugoslavia held a joint press conference to read out the aforementioned declaration. Masaryk also stated that the three governments will informally inform the Western three powers of the results of this meeting.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Marshall stated at a press conference today that, regarding reports of the organization of a People's Republic in North Korea, the U.S. government has not received any information other than what was broadcast by North Korean radio.

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] Lieutenant General Dean, U.S. military governor of South Korea, held a press conference at 10:00 a.m. today and answered reporters' questions as follows: (1) Reporter: What are the Governor's thoughts on the establishment of the People's Republic of North Korea? Answer: I have not heard of the official establishment of a government in North Korea. What I have heard is that the People's Committee of North Korea is currently discussing a draft constitution. I believe that North and South Korea must be unified, and must also be unified economically. I hope that in the future, a government including the majority of the Korean people can be established; (2) Reporter: There are reports that Soviet occupation forces are withdrawing from North Korea. Will U.S. forces also withdraw? Answer: I am not an official of the occupation forces and cannot answer this question.</p>

According to reports, this incident occurred on the 8th of this month during a rally of the Korean People's Army in Pyongyang. General Hodge's letter was sent to North Korea on the 18th and involved officials of the North Korean civilian police and the so-called "People's Army." Hodge's letter stated: "At the time, there were several Soviet officers and soldiers who witnessed [the incident] and knew that Your Excellency was responsible for protecting the liaison officers I sent from any violence, yet they did not step forward to intervene. Therefore, I hope that Your Excellency will immediately investigate the actions of the Soviet and Korean military and civilians involved, punish all those responsible, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again." The letter concluded by stating: U.S. forces in South Korea will take appropriate action in response to this.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] The four major parties, the Liberal Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party, agreed today to elect a new prime minister in the House of Representatives on Saturday.

<h3 id="e65">Prosecutor of International Tribunal Says Emperor of Japan Will Not Be Held Liable for War Crimes; Reading of Indictment Against War Criminals Completed <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The prosecutor of the International Tribunal stated this morning when reading his indictment against Japanese war criminals that, according to the old Japanese constitution, the Emperor, who held "all power of the government," is not responsible for war crimes. The Japanese policy of aggression that caused war crimes was proposed, advocated, and established by 25 war criminals. They were the Emperor's advisors and the country's decision-makers.</p>
<p>The prosecutor pointed out that the war criminals themselves have testified in court that the Emperor only acted on the advice of his advisors and was "unable" to oppose the decisions and recommendations on various issues. The prosecution also stated that the power exercised by the Emperor was ultimately used by the war criminals, so the war criminals must bear full responsibility for the war crimes caused by Japan's policy of aggression. U.S. Assistant Prosecutor Horwitz said when reading the general indictment on the responsibilities of the war criminals: None of the war criminals have previously been charged for actions they took directly while in office. The prosecutor said: If the actions of Kenji Doihara and Seishiro Itagaki were only to carry out military attacks in compliance with the orders of the General Staff, then their crimes in China would not have been charged. They are only accused of engaging in activities that incited acts of aggression and caused the Japanese government to adopt aggressive plans. The prosecutor also said: Koki Hirota and Toshio Shiratori may apply to invoke diplomatic immunity, but they are charged entirely because they stopped performing their "diplomatic missions" and led Japan to join the Axis. The prosecutor continued: War criminals can be divided into several categories, some of whom obviously have close relationships with each other, while others do not have significant relationships with each other, but regardless of their differences, they still have one thing in common, that is, they were unanimously engaged in formulating Japan's policy of aggression, which is an "international crime." The prosecutor confirmed the responsibility of the war criminals, saying: If the defendants who held the final political power to formulate Japanese national policy did not provide active support or tacit acquiescence, the war crimes might not have occurred. The prosecution's general indictment began on the 11th of this month and was only completed this morning near noon. The reading of the separate indictments against each war criminal will begin this afternoon for the trial of war crimes.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Prosecutors at the Far East International Military Tribunal, when submitting a general indictment on Japanese atrocities this afternoon, said: Japanese officials were fully aware of the Nanjing Massacre, and in fact this was part of the policy implemented by the Japanese government. Although the Japanese government paid close attention to this atrocity, it adopted an indifferent attitude and took no action, so that this matter would not be repeated throughout the war against China. When the prosecutor described in detail the massacres, tortures, rapes, and other unimaginable atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China, the foreign and Japanese people in the audience appeared to be unbearable to hear. Iwane Matsui, the commander of the Japanese army during the Nanjing Massacre, looked uneasy in the defendant's box, his mind seemingly recalling the scene at the time. He frequently bit his fingers to conceal his embarrassment.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the Far East Tribunal arrived here today from Tokyo.

Keenan declined to speculate on the court's ruling as to whether the Japanese war chiefs would be sentenced to death, saying that it was not his place to comment on the court's actions.</p>

<p>The Sword of the God of War Hangs Over Our Heads</p>
<p>Since we could not expect good performance from the Konoe Cabinet, we certainly could not expect anything more from the Tojo Cabinet, which was formed after October 17th. Tojo had served as Minister of the Army. After becoming Prime Minister, he remained an active-duty army officer. He was a typical Japanese officer, with narrow, rigid, and inflexible thinking. He was stubborn, wishful-thinking (foolish), forceful, and had considerable drive.</p>
<p>The new Japanese Foreign Minister, Togo, was a typical official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Within his profession, he was a good technician, but his views were quite narrow and did not allow for broad observation.</p>
<p>At the same time, I began to notice the urgency in Tojo's attitude towards our talks. Konoe had urged us to quickly accept his conditions, but one of his goals was to use our agreement with him to remain in office. Tojo also wanted to act quickly, but his goal was different from Konoe's. I believed that if an agreement could not be reached, he was prepared to act, which meant initiating war.</p>
<p>This sense of urgency, almost a frantic action, attempted to force us to reach an agreement, giving Tokyo everything it wanted; this sense of urgency continued until the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident. We detected this intention within days of Tojo seizing power. At that time, a telegram from October 21st to Nomura was intercepted, and the translation was delivered to my desk, stating: "Regarding expressing opinions and clarifying our position, our country has said almost everything that can be said. We feel that we have reached a point where, apart from asking the United States to reconsider its views, we cannot take any further positive action. Therefore, we request that at an appropriate time, you or Wakasugi (Counselor of the Japanese Embassy) should directly explain to the United States that our country cannot spend more time discussing these issues."</p>
<p>The Tojo government's sense of urgency continued to increase. On November 3rd, Foreign Minister Togo instructed the former Ambassador to Germany, Kurusu, to come to Washington, clearly to assist Nomura in negotiating with me. We immediately took all possible steps, at the request of the Japanese government, to expedite his flight across the Pacific.</p>
<p>On the same day, Ambassador Grew sent me a telegram with his opinion. He believed that if our negotiations failed, Japan might engage in a self-destructive act of desperation.</p>
<p>In the intercepted telegrams, we discovered a deadline for the first time. Togo stated in his telegram to Nomura on November 5th: "Due to various circumstances, the completion of the signing of all agreements by the 25th of this month is absolutely necessary. I know this is a difficult order, but under the current circumstances, it is an unavoidable order. Please fully understand this point and prevent Japanese-American relations from falling into chaos."</p>
<p>In our view, there was only one explanation: Japan had already set its war machine in motion, and if we did not accept its demands by November 25th, Japan had decided to resort to war.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the U.S. Cabinet meeting on November 7th, I issued a severe warning about the current crisis. In this solemn meeting, the situation in the Far East occupied all of our minds. As usual, the President began the Cabinet meeting by first reviewing the situation himself, and then seeking opinions from appropriate personnel or requesting cabinet members to offer their assessments. But this time, he directly asked me if I had anything to discuss.</p>
<p>I spoke for about fifteen minutes, pointing out the crisis in the entire international situation. I also detailed the progress of our negotiations with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>I concluded, "In my view, the situation is extremely critical. We should watch out for Japanese military attacks at any time and in any place."</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, the President went around and sought the opinions of each cabinet member. They all agreed with my assessment of the crisis.</p>
<p>The Cabinet unanimously agreed that the dangerous situation should be emphasized by senior officials in their speeches so that the people of the whole country could prepare for this development. In the following days, the President, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Undersecretary of State Welles all delivered powerful speeches on this issue.</p>
<p>Although Nomura continued to reiterate Japan's peaceful intentions, the intercepted telegrams sent to my desk told a different story. One of the telegrams, dated November 14th, was sent from Tokyo to the Japanese representative in Shanghai, explaining what might happen in China if our negotiations failed. The telegram stated: "We will completely destroy British and American power in China. We will take over enemy concessions and interests in China (customs and mines)."</p>
<p>On November 15th, Kurusu arrived in Washington. On November 17th, Nomura accompanied Kurusu to my office. In my view, Kurusu seemed to be the opposite of Nomura. Neither his appearance nor his attitude inspired trust or respect. From the beginning, I felt that he was very cunning. From the intercepted telegrams, the information we constantly received, and the analysis of the Japanese attitude in our talks, we already knew Japan's intentions. Therefore, it seemed impossible that Kurusu did not know the Japanese government's plan and his mission when he left Japan. He was sent to Washington with one of two goals: one was to use all possible pressure and enticement to force us to accept Japan's conditions, and the other was, after failing in this regard, to use negotiations to relax us until Japan was ready to complete its attack.</p>
<p>When introducing Kurusu to me, Nomura also handed me a statement from the Japanese government. We had requested the Tojo Cabinet to confirm the points that the Konoe Cabinet had already agreed to. This statement from the Japanese government accepted our request.</p>
<p>After a brief conversation, I accompanied the two envoys across the street to the White House for a meeting with the President. The situation could not be more urgent at this time. Just the day before, Nomura had received a telegram from Tojo confirming the November 25th deadline. We had also intercepted this telegram.</p>
<p>The telegram stated: "According to Your Excellency's opinion, we should patiently wait and see the turn of the war situation. But I am sorry to say that the current situation has made it impossible for us to do so. I have proposed a deadline for settling these negotiations and cannot change it. Please understand this point. You also know how short time is; therefore, do not allow the United States to divert our attention and continue to delay the negotiations. Force them to seek a solution according to our proposal. Please make the greatest effort to facilitate an immediate solution."</p>
<p>Things had become such that we had to sign the document specified by the Japanese side, or else accept all the consequences.</p>
<p>Neither in that White House meeting, nor in the discussions between Nomura, Kurusu, and me over the next three days, did the new Japanese envoys offer any new suggestions.</p>
<p>The intercepted telegrams from Tokyo had undoubtedly proven that a crisis was imminent. Nomura had received instructions to evacuate Japanese residents in the United States, and he had also received a new telegram code, the method being: he could listen to Japanese shortwave news broadcasts and pay attention to the reports on wind direction; from this, he could know whether Japan would break off diplomatic relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, or Britain. The telegram also told him to destroy all codes, secret documents, etc., after hearing this report.</p>
<p>Then, on November 20th—Thanksgiving—Nomura and Kurusu gave me a new set of proposals, which, on the surface, were very extreme. The intercepted Japanese telegrams told us that this was Japan's final proposal. This was a "take it or leave it" ultimatum.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese proposal was so absurd in nature that no responsible U.S. official could dream of accepting it, I felt that my reaction should not be too intense, so as to avoid giving the Japanese side an excuse to break off negotiations.</p>
<p>On November 21st, Kurusu came to see me alone. I asked Kurusu whether he himself or Nomura had any suggestions to offer for a peaceful resolution to the whole problem. He replied that he did not.</p>
<p>After Kurusu's visit to me and his statement that there were no further proposals on this issue, I doubled my warnings to Washington authorities and individuals (including General Stark), pointing out that Japan might take action at any time.</p>
<p>Diplomatically speaking, the situation could be said to be hopeless, but on our part, we were trying everything we could to seek a peaceful solution in order to avoid or delay war. Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Staff Marshall, and Chief of Naval Operations Stark were all people I frequently contacted. They all requested more time to prepare American resistance. On the one hand, Japan demanded a showdown with us. We stood firm for our principles. The Japanese side also did not yield, and tried their best to coerce us into accepting their demands.</p>
<p>On November 21st and 22nd, we prepared to put forward a counter-proposal. We drafted a temporary agreement, to which would be attached an outline of a permanent agreement.</p>
<p>We strived to draft an outline of a peace agreement, including ten main points, to be attached to the temporary agreement. Generally speaking, my colleagues and I had reached the end of our rope in trying to salvage the crisis.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau drafted a solution in his department and sent it to me. Although this was another example of the Secretary of the Treasury overstepping his bounds and attempting to take on the work of a second Secretary of State, some of the points were good and were therefore incorporated into our final draft.</p>
<p>The telegram intercepted from Tokyo to Nomura and Kurusu on November 22nd had extended the deadline from November 25th to the 29th. After the deadline, it would be war. The telegram stated: "Adhere to our established policy and do your best. To facilitate the solution we need, you should spare no effort. There are many reasons why we must resolve U.S.-Japan relations before the 25th that are beyond your ability to imagine, but in the next three or four days, if you can complete negotiations with the U.S. side, if the signing can be completed before the 29th (let me write it again—the 29th), if the exchange of notes can be completed, if we obtain the understanding of Britain and the Netherlands, in short, if all things can be completed, then we have decided to wait until that day. This time we mean what we say. The deadline absolutely cannot be changed. After that, things will happen automatically."</p>
<p>"After that, things will happen automatically." Under the shadow of this sentence, we worked desperately for the next two weeks, trying to secure peace, or at least more time.</p>
<p>About an hour after my meeting with the British, Chinese, Australian, and Dutch envoys (then on November 22nd), Nomura and Kurusu came to my residence to see me. Seeing these Japanese representatives arrive at my home with smiles, politeness, and a very friendly appearance was almost a dreamlike environment. Since I knew from the intercepted telegrams of Japan's malicious plan, and understood that Kurusu and Nomura also knew the same information, it was painful for me to talk to them in the same tone and with the same attitude. They sat there, bowing constantly, Nomura sometimes chuckling, and Kurusu also smiling, but in their minds was a thought: if we did not say "yes" to Japan's demands, their government would launch a new invasion within days, sooner or later engaging in war with the United States.</p>
<p>On November 24th, we intercepted Tojo's telegram to Nomura, stating that the previous deadline was November 29th, Tokyo time. Therefore, the sword of the God of War was hanging over our heads, and would erupt after the scheduled time arrived.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Landing Plan of Bandit Ding Foiled, Corpses Transported to Qingpu and Heads Displayed to the Public, Captured Bandits Detained Awaiting Interrogation, Meritorious Troops to Be Recommended for Awards by Military Authorities <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The communist bandits of Ding Xishan's unit, who had been rampaging in the Songjiang-Qingpu area, have been completely annihilated after five days of encirclement and suppression since landing in Punan. In the battle of Youbang District, Qingpu, on the 18th, the national army and local teams, under the joint command of Gao, the regimental commander of the 5th Regiment of the Youth Army, and Xing Zuoyuan, the deputy regimental commander, Zhang Shujin, the battalion commander, and Liu Jing, the magistrate of Qingpu County, exerted their maximum power, thwarting the bandits' attempt to establish a command headquarters in Jiangnan to threaten the security of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The rumor that Ding Xishan had been killed has been confirmed. The results of the battle include the capture of seven Thompson submachine guns, one carbine, four light machine guns, three grenade launchers, fourteen rifles, one full-auto/semi-auto rifle, 125 hand grenades, ten bayonets, and ten ammunition clips (with live ammunition). These weapons are extremely sophisticated and are currently stored in the Qingpu County Government. In addition, the captured senior bandit officers include Tang Jingyan (alias Zhang Wang), the "Deputy Commander of the Jiangnan People's Liberation Army Column," Secretary Zhou Yongxing, Propaganda Section Chief Yu Jinzu, Administration Section Chief Wu Jian, Combat Platoon Leader Ji Chunyue, and squad leaders Zhang Ketong, Qian Juemin, medic Zhou Zhimin, signalman Wu Hai, machine gunners Zhou Yongkang, Luo Xiaobing, grenadiers Jin Yinman, Zhang Jinrong, cook Pan Weichao, and soldiers Xu Hexiang, Xie Guoju, Chen Xuezeng, Ma Aniao, Zhang Youcai, Hu Laixing, Luo Ada, Shi Xingfa, Shen Shijun, Sun Azhao, Yu Zide, Pan Xianfa, Chen Caimai, Hu Yincai, Zhang Jin, Lu Mingbao, Wang Kaihua, Yang Abu, Zhang Akang, Lu Dongtian, Yang Zhonghuang, Lin Mingtong, Cai Ping, Li Zhikang, Chang Zicheng, Jiang Fuquan, and Dong Changgen, totaling forty-two people. All of them are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but they were all trained in the Soviet Northern bandit area and sent here. They are currently being held in the Qingpu Police Bureau. A preliminary interrogation will be conducted in the next few days, and the authorities will then decide on how to handle them. The meritorious troops will be recommended for awards by the military authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Ding's Corpse Dressed in a Long Robe, Died from a Bullet in the Mouth, Insignia Discovered <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The thirteen bandit corpses that were killed on the spot in the battle were transported to Qingpu yesterday, including the corpse of bandit leader Ding Xishan. He had a flat head, was wearing a long robe and silk cotton padded clothes, and had a jade seal with the three characters "丁錫山" (Ding Xishan) engraved on it (see photo). It is known that the name used by Ding among the people of Punan was always the character "山" (Shan), but according to the captured bandits, Ding always used the character "三" (San) in the bandit area. Ding's head was hung on the top of the Gengcheng Gate in Qingpu for public display at 11:45 yesterday morning. A young man named Shen from Songze Village in Qingpu, who had been arrested and persecuted by Ding during the enemy-puppet period, rushed to watch after hearing the news, applauded with joy after seeing it, and said that it was definitely the bandit Ding. The head was taken down at 4:10 in the afternoon and sewn back onto the body. Ding died from a bullet in the mouth. According to the national army who witnessed it at the time and the captured bandits, Ding and Tang Jingyan split into two groups due to the encirclement and suppression, each leading a part of the bandits to resist stubbornly in the graves. Later, as the encirclement shrank to within 100 meters, the target became closer and exposed. Xu Dengfang, a first-class soldier sniper from the Fourth Battalion of the Second Regiment of the National Army, swam across a small river and bypassed the back of the base of one of Ding's units, fired a shot, and immediately hit the bandit Ding. Ding and the captured bandit officers were all wearing civilian clothes, which it is said they had changed into by borrowing rough clothes from local farmers, in preparation for escaping after knowing they would be surrounded.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Purpose of Landing <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of Ding's unit landing in Fengxian in batches this time was not only to harass Songjiang and Qingpu, but to attempt to gather old troops and establish the "Jiangnan People's Liberation Army Headquarters" at the old nest of Guanyintang in Chonggu, Qingpu, and then gradually expand and threaten the security of Nanjing and Shanghai. They planned that if this plan encountered obstacles or they could not survive, they would move to Dianshan Lake or Tai Lake, or go to the eastern Zhejiang area, until they finally realized their plan. However, they did not expect that after landing, they would be followed and pursued by the 152nd Brigade of Fengxian, and then be ambushed by various troops, and captured. According to the captured "Deputy Commander" Tang Jingyan, their equipment was complete when they left Northern Jiangsu, but after landing and being pursued, many people deserted and scattered along the way, so some of the weapons were lost. The remaining bandits were mostly veteran communist cadres, selected and formed by the communist areas in Northern Jiangsu before departure. Their combat effectiveness was quite high, so they were able to maintain the battle for several hours or more in encounters. When Gao, Deputy Commander Xing, and Magistrate Liu of the Youth Army interrogated them yesterday, the captured bandits were still deluded, which shows how deeply they had been poisoned.</p>

<p>Xing, the deputy regimental commander of the Youth Army who was responsible for commanding the battle, gave a detailed battle report at the Qingpu County Government last night, stating: "On the 17th, the bandit army窜抵 Phoenix Mountain. At noon, Zhang, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion stationed in Chonggu, transferred the 4th and 5th companies and the Qingpu Security Team to ambush them. The 5th Company also transferred to Zhujiejiao to deploy defensive positions for the mountain and lake ports. At the same time, Xing also personally led the 2nd Company from Nanxiang to Qingpu to reinforce. That night, the bandits fled west to Tianma Mountain, and it was reported that they had forcibly requisitioned three civilian boats in Xuxiang, intending to enter the lake. The 5th Company immediately sealed off all ports. At that time, the Songjiang Security Team also arrived. At dawn on the 18th, after confirming the bandits' whereabouts, they launched an encirclement. They made contact near Nanyoubang, with the 5th Company attacking from the west, the 4th Company attacking from the north, and the 2nd Squad of the Qingpu Security Team exerting pressure from the east. At 9:00, the 9th Squad attacked from the southwest. At 10:00, the Songjiang Security Team joined the attack from the north, and the battle situation became intense. The bandits relied on their complete weapons and complex terrain to resist stubbornly for a long time. Near noon, the bandit leader Ding Xishan was shot and killed, and the bandits began to waver. In a panic, they threw hand grenades, but because the ground was wet due to rain, most of them did not explode. The national army, fearing that they would be caught in a stalemate, delaying until dark, and giving the bandits a chance to escape into the lake, and that it would be difficult to start 淸剿, ordered the firing of mortars, and the bandits fell one after another. By 2:30 in the afternoon, the national army had reduced the encirclement to a small area, and shouted and the officially ended.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Commander Xuan's Remarks <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Xuan 　吾, the Commander of the Shanghai Garrison, told reporters yesterday: (1) The communist bandit Ding Xishan's unit's disturbance of several counties in the 　备 district was an attempt to establish a base in Pudong in order to further disrupt the security of this city. Now that it has been completely cleared, its attempt has been thoroughly crushed, and the security of this city has become more consolidated. (2) In this 淸剿 operation, the Garrison Headquarters planned the whole process, with the national army as the main force, and the security teams of various counties cooperated, achieving the expected results. From the time the communist bandits landed until they were 肃淸, they could not stay in their disturbed areas for more than three hours. The national army and various local teams worked closely together, leaving the bandits no room to breathe, weary of running around, and finally 全歼ed. (3) The communist bandits once had the intention of escaping from Dianshan Lake, but the 202nd Division of the Youth Army rode five ships in advance to ambush them, and then pressed the communist bandits into Anzhuang to encircle them, achieving complete success. Personnel who contributed to this battle will be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for rewards. (4) He has ordered the 202nd Division of the Youth Army and the 　 government of Qingpu to thoroughly interrogate the captured bandits. Those who are 　 important will be sent to the police 　 for interrogation, and those who are secondary will be detained in the Qingpu County Government to await punishment. The weapons that were seized 　 　 be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for inspection. It was also learned that Commander Xuan received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense on the 19th, allocating an additional infantry battalion of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, which will come to Shanghai today to strengthen the 防卫 force of the 备区.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Ding Xishan, who has entrenched himself north and south of the Pujiang River for a decade, is fickle and unpredictable, sometimes an anti-Japanese hero, sometimes a traitorous collaborator, and finally a defector to the communist bandits. He is from Wujiaqiao, Zhuangxing, Fengxian County, the son of a farmer. He has four brothers: the eldest is named Pinshan, the second Jinshan, the fourth Yishan, and Xishan is the third, so he is also known as Xisan. He received no education and was violent by nature from a young age. As an adult, he did not engage in honest work, but idled his time away, specializing in associating with local ruffians. Later, he joined a kidnapping gang and was arrested and imprisoned in 1931 due to a case. In 1937, when the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, the enemy occupied Shanghai. Ding took advantage of the chaos to escape from prison and formed a sworn brotherhood with Li Qimeng and more than ten others who were imprisoned together. They hid in the countryside south of the Pujiang River and operated under the self-proclaimed title of guerrilla commander. By the early spring of 1938, their manpower and weaponry had accumulated to several hundred, and they established relations with our government authorities, being appointed as the Third Detachment of the Loyal and Patriotic Army of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee. In July of the same year, it was reorganized into the Eighth Detachment, and He Xingjian, a special commissioner from the Loyal and Patriotic Army Headquarters, was stationed in Ding's unit for guidance. At that time, the Japanese army also paid considerable attention to him, and from time to time sent troops to encircle and attack him. Later, the instructor He Xingjian was induced to join the enemy, and Ding then in September 1939</p>
<p>defected to the puppet regime. His unit of over a thousand men was reorganized into the "Peace and National Salvation Army 12th Route Army," with He as commander and Ding as deputy. Later, the traitor He was executed by personnel dispatched by the headquarters, and Ding then appointed himself as commander. At that time, he established his headquarters on the Great Western Road in Shanghai, specializing in kidnapping wealthy merchants and extorting huge sums of money to expand his troops. By the late summer of 1940, he was reorganized into the Puppet 13th Division, with himself as the division commander. His influence spread to more than ten counties, including Songjiang, Fengxian, Baoshan, Qingpu, Wujiang, Pinghu, Chuansha, and Nanhui. At its peak, his unit consisted of four brigades, totaling 20,000 men. Because he was excessively arrogant, he was resented by the enemy and did not get along with the traitor Ye. He was imprisoned in eastern Zhejiang. The Japanese army kept a very close watch on him, and Ding was unable to do as he pleased, deeply suffering, and his strength gradually weakened. Therefore, he thought of</p>
<p>turning against them, but before the plan could be carried out, his subordinate Song Lizhi betrayed him and had him detained by Japanese troops and escorted to the puppet capital. Li interceded for him, and he was spared death and imprisoned in Jiangxi. In 1943, Ding made friends with Zhou Shixiong, He Zhong, He Ying and others, a total of twelve people, disguised themselves, forged official documents, tricked their way out of prison, secretly returned to Punan, reorganized his old troops, and staged a comeback. In 1944, he re-established contact with the Loyal and Patriotic Army Headquarters and was summoned back to the rear for reorganization and training. In April of the same year, he returned to Punan to prepare to assist the American landing. In August, the Japanese surrendered, and Ding's unit was initially reorganized into the 11th Column of the Loyal and Patriotic Army's Special Operations Detachment, and later reorganized into the Traffic Police, serving on the Jiaoji Railway in Qingdao, with Ding as the captain of the Traffic Police Brigade. Soon after, he was dismissed from his post due to a case, and immediately began to communicate secretly with the communist bandits. The Ministry of National Defense, believing that he had connections with the bandits, issued an arrest warrant last year, and Ding fled to northern Jiangsu and formally defected to the bandits.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Seven Casualties Among Officers and Soldiers in the Campaign to Suppress Ding's Bandits <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In the recent campaign to suppress Ding's bandits, on the side of the National Army, the youth army squad leader Mei Jibao and one soldier of the Qingpu Security Brigade were killed in action. The platoon leader Dong Hui, squad leader Wen Liewen, and soldier Liu Zunyao were seriously wounded. Squad leader An Pingya and soldier Zhang Wenjiang were slightly wounded.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Rental Standards; Many Parties Oppose; Calculated According to Index; Land Administration Bureau Drafts Overnight; Submitted to Municipal Council for Discussion <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The municipal government convened a meeting of representatives from relevant agencies and organizations yesterday at the municipal government to discuss the issue of rental standards in the city, with over 40 people attending. Director Zhu chaired the meeting. During the meeting, the representatives exchanged opinions vigorously, with many opposing the calculation of rent based on the cost of living index. Speaker Pan appealed on behalf of the citizens that rent must be restricted. He stated: Rental standards must be formulated, but calculating them according to the cost of living index is very unreasonable. Because the income of the majority of workers and shop employees in this city is not based on the cost of living index, they will inevitably be unable to bear the burden. The Rental Ordinance stipulates that the government has the right to designate the maximum amount of rent, and it is hoped that the municipal government will fulfill this.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was for discussion and exchange purposes, so there was no concrete decision, but Director Zhu guaranteed that it would not increase the burden on citizens. The opinions of the representatives can be summarized as follows: (1) It is indeed necessary to regulate rents in this city, but rental standards should not be calculated according to the cost of living index. A more reasonable basis should be researched and determined as the base figure for rent. The so-called reasonable basis is divided into two types: A. Use the average of the current actual rents in this city as the basis. B. Based on the average cost of living index of workers and employees, make an appropriate discount. (2) The adjustment of the rental base number may be considered once every three months. (3) The rental standards for public school employees should be based on the average of the net rent index for employees and workers in the previous three months, and the news and cultural circles will also be given the same preferential treatment. (4) The rental standards for commercial buildings can be slightly higher and should not be rigidly restricted. Director Zhu stated that the Land Administration Bureau will refer to the opinions offered by the above parties and draft the maximum rent amount overnight, submitting it to today's municipal council meeting for approval, and then sending it to the Fifth General Assembly of the Participating Council for final approval.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Period of Parole for Sick Prisoners Not Included in Sentence <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] For prisoners who have been convicted and are serving their sentences, if they are released on bail for medical treatment due to illness, whether the period of parole should be included in the sentence has been submitted by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. After research by the Unified Interpretation Law Conference of the Judicial Yuan, according to the provisions of Article 59, Paragraph 3 of the Prison Execution Law, the period of parole due to illness should not be included in the sentence. The municipal court has recently received this instruction. According to this interpretation, the treatment period for the currently paroled traitorous collaborators, such as Wen Lanting and Yuan, will be calculated separately.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Ding Bandit's Old Influence in Punan Will Also Disappear Invisible; The Three-District Security Commander Talks About the Bandit Elimination Process; Military-Civilian Cooperation Achieves Brilliant Results; It Is Expected That the Communist Bandits Will Not Dare to Disturb the Coast Again Within Three Months <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xie Chengbing, the Commissioner and Security Commander of the Third District of Jiangsu Province, and Zhu Changzhong, the Deputy Commander, returned to Songjiang from Qingpu yesterday morning. When reporters interviewed them, both stated with excitement and delight: "The Shanghai news media's continuous reporting of the true bandit situation, dispelling rumors, and stabilizing public morale have greatly helped this bandit elimination." The reporter also congratulated them on their success and inquired about the post-war arrangements and their thoughts on this Ding bandit invasion. Commissioner Xie stated: The large number of Ding Xishan's old troops in the Punan area and the thickness of their latent influence were well known. Since Ding's defection to the bandits, we have been overly concerned about this. In particular, the counties under the jurisdiction of the Third District are adjacent to Shanghai City. Ensuring the security of the Third District can stabilize Shanghai City. Now that the invading Ding bandit troops have been completely wiped out, it proves the strength of the Third District's garrison and the strictness of the public's self-defense organizations. Furthermore, this incident should serve as a warning to the military and civilians in Jiangnan in the future. As for the losses to the rural areas caused by this pursuit of Ding's bandits and the destruction by artillery fire, investigations will begin immediately, and the government is preparing to provide relief or compensation. Finally, he stated in a very optimistic tone: It is expected that within three months, the communist bandits will definitely not dare to disturb the coast of the Third District again, and Ding's bandit's old influence will also disappear invisibly. Deputy Commander Zhu also elaborated in detail on the military deployment for this bandit elimination. According to him, one hour after the bandits landed on the 12th at dusk, the Security Command received a telephone report from Wanghai Township, Qianjiaqiao Town. Upon receiving this alarm, the Command first telephoned the Songjiang County Government, but when they telephoned the Fengxian County Government for the second time, the telephone line was cut. The telephone lines in various towns and villages in Punan were also out of order, proving that Ding's bandits had made arrangements before landing. However, the telephone lines in various towns were immediately restored the next day, and the National Army and the Security Team began to pursue, exhausting the bandits and giving them no time to attend to other matters. As for the tactics used in this battle, the Command had three principles: (1) The village self-defense team, led by the village head, was responsible for closely following the bandits' tracks and reporting their whereabouts to the Command at any time using the village telephones. (2) The county and town self-defense teams were responsible for blocking. (3) The security teams from all areas concentrated their main forces to encircle and annihilate the bandits. This tactic was very successful. Since the 13th, the Security Command has always been fully aware of the bandits' whereabouts. It was originally planned to annihilate them in the Tianmashan area, but contact was lost between Zhujiahang in Punan and Tianmashan in Pubei. Later, this plan could not be realized. The former was disconnected after eight hours and the latter after four hours. The village heads of the two places have now been detained by the Security Command for interrogation. However, according to their confessions, the village head of Zhujiahang took sick leave, so no one was responsible. The village head of Tianmashan, after the bandits fled into the Tianmashan area, led his troops to follow the wandering bandits, forgetting to report. Both are excusable and will be treated leniently. As for the invading bandits, in addition to Ding and his personal followers, the rest were all veteran cadres of the communist bandits, each of whom was qualified to serve as a company commander. Ding's intention was to come to Punan, gather his old troops, and establish a new base. However, after landing, they were pursued everywhere by the National Army and the Security Team, giving them no chance to rest. Although the 152nd Brigade of the National Army did not catch up in the final battle of annihilation in Anzhuang, they had been closely following the bandits and pursuing them ever since they landed on the coast of Fengxian, to Shenjiajiao, to Yanduntou, across the Pujiang River, across the railway, and finally to Tianmashan. Their contribution cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The deputy bandit leader of the "Jiangnan People's Liberation Self-Defense Column," Tang Jingyan, who was captured alive by the National Army, goes by the alias of Zhang Yu. He is 45 years old, from Rugao, Jiangsu. When captured, he was wearing cotton padded clothes and pants, cloth shoes and socks, dressed entirely as a farmer. He had a minor injury to his left hand, which had been bandaged and slung up. Judging from his thin appearance, he looked like a country bumpkin. At noon yesterday, Gao Tongxing, the Regiment Commander, Xing Zuyuan, the Deputy Regiment Commander, and Liu Jin, the Magistrate of Qingpu County, of the ××× Division × Brigade × Regiment of the Youth Army, brought the prisoner to the Qingpu County Government for a thorough interrogation about his defection to the bandits and his collusion with Ding Guoshan to come south.

The provincial government sent a team to disarm them, and the troops were reorganized to Taizhou. Then I was changed to the artillery battalion commander of the Second Column. After Li Changjiang defected to the puppet regime, I left, and then served as the chief of staff of Huang Xianping's regiment headquarters. Soon after, I left again, planning to establish an independent regiment in Qihai, with 3,000 to 4,000 guns. In the spring of 1941, Tao Yong of the New Fourth Army came and confiscated the guns, and I served as his director (Tenth District of Nantong). Not long after, I went to the Tonghai District to serve as the head of the People's Defense Corps, with about 100 guns. During the rural cleanup campaign, I served as the puppet guard regiment commander. After Li Shiqun's death, the New Fourth Army sent someone to contact me. In 1943, I pulled the troops to the New Fourth Army to serve as the commander of the First Division's Independent Regiment, and later as the deputy commander of the United Resistance (commander Huang Yufeng).

Not long after, I returned home and worked in a transportation company in Donghe, and then served as the commander of the New Fourth Army's Northern Jiangsu Coastal Defense Command, with a defense zone from Tongzhou to Chongming, with about two regiments of troops.</p>

<p>Q: How did you join forces with Ding Xishan? A: In August last year, Ding Xishan went to Yandong in northern Jiangsu, taking about 20 people to meet Tao Yong, but he did not meet him.

At the end of the year, he contacted Guan Wenwei, the commander of the Central China Military Region of the Communist Party, and established the Jiangnan People's Liberation Self-Defense Column, with Ding as the commander and me as the deputy commander. This was requested by Ding and agreed to by me.</p>
<p>Q: What task did Guan Wenwei give Ding? A: No task.</p>

We joined forces and retreated west to Wujiaqiao in southern Punan for one night, crossed the railway to Huaqiao Station. Because the township office had a self-defense team and saw many vehicles, we went north to Songjiang Sheshan, Tianmashan, Beisan, and passed through Xuxiang, where we recruited the "Third Sister" who was a local woman, and went to Yunshan Lake and then to Taihu Lake. The next morning, we were attacked by the National Army in Anzhuang.</p>

<h3 id="e88">There Is a Black Market for Air Freight in Beiping; The Insider Story of the Reported Malpractice; The District Prosecutor's Office Regularly Summons the Heads of the Two Companies <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of the Beiping Office of China and Central Airlines being reported for raising freight rates without authorization and being suspected of malpractice is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. It is reported that the reporter is a certain military agency in Beiping, which reported to the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government. The content of the report is that the planes of China and Central Airlines transported goods to Taiyuan, Shanxi. Because the outskirts of Taiyuan were harassed by communist bandits, land transportation was inconvenient, and merchants tended to use air freight, resulting in the aircraft being in greater demand than supply, so they arbitrarily increased freight rates, entrusting H Ji and Hua Mao freight companies to increase the original 2,000 yuan per kilogram to 21,200 yuan per kilogram. The actual black market freight rate is as high as 50,000 yuan per kilogram. According to the investigation, the 21,200 yuan per kilogram was approved by the head office, but the 50,000 yuan was a private price increase. According to the investigation by a military agency, the so-called H Ji and Hua Mao freight companies are also fictitious names to facilitate collusion between superiors and subordinates. Ding Chuanen, the prosecutor in charge of the case, went to China Airlines a few days ago to question Liu Anping, the acting director of the business department, and Jiang Nengxiang, the head of the freight department, who were important persons involved in the case, and scheduled a hearing on the 24th of this month to investigate. Liu Jingyi, the general manager of China Airlines, Xu Xin, the director of the Beiping Office, Chen Zhuolin, the general manager of Central Airlines, and Wang Bingnan, the director of the Beiping Office, will be summoned to court for questioning.</p>

<p>Sugar and Tea Are More Promising</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] President Zhang of the National Bank took a China Airlines plane from Taiwan to Shanghai at 1:00 pm yesterday. When reporters asked him about his views on Taiwan's export trade, Zhang said: The more promising items for Taiwan's exports this year are sugar and tea. At the same time, there are still some items that can be shipped to the mainland, which can reduce foreign exchange expenditures, such as paper.</p>
<p>Zhang also mentioned that in the future, Taiwan's rice production will increase, which can help the mainland solve the food problem. Because Taiwan used to export hundreds of thousands of tons, but it needs to replenish fertilizer. He also mentioned that Taiwan's agricultural administration and water conservancy can be used as a reference for the mainland. In particular, rice-producing provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Fujian have sent personnel to study the lessons that can be learned and should be used as much as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhang took a train to Beijing last night.</p>

The contact address in the city is the Shanghai Office of the Civil Aviation Administration in the Sassoon Building, Dianchi Road. Lai Xunyan, the chief pilot of the Civil Aviation Administration and Air Force Colonel, is also the director of the club. According to Lai, anyone over the age of 18, a high school graduate, and physically strong can apply to participate in the Flying Technology Coaching Class. However, those under the age of 20 must provide a consent form from their guardian. Lai estimated that after eight hours of learning, they can fly alone. After 50 hours, the training for elementary flight will be completed, and the Civil Aviation Administration can issue a private flight pilot's license. When students enroll, they pre-pay a flight fee of 10 million yuan. The tuition fee is calculated by time, with a fuel fee of 1.2 million yuan per hour. That is, studying for eight hours costs 9.6 million yuan. Completing elementary flight training requires approximately 70 million to 100 million yuan. After completing elementary flight training, they become an amateur pilot and can join the Flying Club as a member.

<p>— Li Hanhun</p>
<p>Naval Academy</p>
<p>A brief review of the history of science and machine development provides a deeper understanding of the fundamental reasons for Britain's industrial success. From science to industry, from industry to commerce, from commerce to the exploration of overseas markets, and from the protection of overseas markets to the development of the navy, Britain has earned the reputation of being the "Lord of the Seas." Although there was not enough time to see the full picture of the "Lord of the Seas," thanks to the prior arrangements made by the embassy, I was accompanied by Military Attaché Chen Wuxunying and a liaison officer from the British Admiralty. I was very pleased to visit the Royal Naval Academy, an important institution for naval education.</p>
<p>First, we went to the office, where the president explained the history of the Royal Naval Academy. According to him, "The Naval Academy is located on the site of a royal palace that was built 500 years ago. In 1610, a new palace for the queen was built; in 1640, the English king was exiled and a republican government was established; in 1660, the monarchy was restored; around 1700, during the Anglo-Spanish War, the king and queen, mindful of the hardships of naval officers and soldiers, donated this palace as a naval hospital, which was later converted into a convalescent home for elderly officers and soldiers, and the treasury continued to fund its construction. Later, the elderly officers and soldiers were given pensions instead, so this palace was used as the school site. The office where we are sitting is the former dining room of the English king." He then led us to view the various furnishings in the room and explained the charts on the walls. In the corner of the room was a large clock made in 1680, antique in color and still accurate. In the reception room inside the door were the names of the past presidents, and the right room was filled with portraits of senior naval officers from the Nelson era, which were very impressive. We went out to see the wharf used by the king and queen, and the splendor remained.</p>
<p>St. Paul's circular-style Queen's Palace is the center of the entire school. To the left, right, and front, there are magnificent buildings. To the left is the dining hall and science laboratory. The ceiling of the dining hall is adorned with magnificent murals. On the main seat in the main hall is a painting depicting the entertainment of King George II of England and his three generations, which took 19 years to complete and cost the painter 6,000 pounds. It also depicts the painter reaching out to ask for money, which shows the British sense of humor. To the right is the chapel and staff school (the staff class for officers above the rank of colonel is not permanent), which I did not see in detail. The school's regular class is located elsewhere, and unfortunately I did not have time to visit it. To the left and behind the Queen's Palace stands the Greenwich Observatory, the world's standard time, which I also only saw from a distance, which was a great pity.</p>
<p>After touring the school for a week, we discussed issues such as the ratio of land, sea, and air forces and the importance of the navy after the war. Although the scope was too broad and not all the details were covered, I learned that the highest number of soldiers in Britain during this war reached more than five million. Since the demobilization began on September 18, 1945, it is estimated that by the end of March 1948, the total number of land, sea, and air forces will be 937,000, including 527,000 in the army, 263,000 in the air force, and 147,000 in the navy, which is about three times more than before the war. It also proved that in the future, maritime traffic must be maintained effectively through the cooperation of the sea and air.</p>
<p>It was summer vacation and a weekend, so I was unable to hear lectures in the classroom and various exercises, which I was very unhappy about. After a brief visit, I discovered vitality in the ancient world. Culture and military force are presented side by side. In the past, Britain's dominance at sea had its own reasons.</p>
<p>Oxford University</p>
<p>Huang Bingjun drove, Military Attaché Han Junchang accompanied us, and Jufang prepared notebooks and went straight to Oxford. From the urban area to the countryside, the plains were vast, quiet, and peaceful, which was very pleasant. Soon we arrived at our destination and visited Mr. Xiong Shiyi. Mr. Xiong has written extensively, especially the play "Wang Baochuan," which is famous in Europe and America. The host was hospitable and asked about our health. Then he asked his family to prepare a meal and took on the task of being our tour guide.</p>
<p>Oxford is a famous university district in England. Everywhere you look, you see schools. Oxford was founded more than 1,260 years ago, 20 years earlier than Cambridge. The cultural center with a history of 700 years has been continuous, profound, and ancient. No wonder the British are proud of this. Most of the buildings in the school are old buildings from four or five hundred years ago. The new buildings also strive to imitate the ancient style, so they are full of antique charm. The style is mostly a large courtyard in the middle, surrounded by houses, like a manor in Beiping. Sometimes it is also surrounded by walls with battlements on them, which look like bunkers from a distance. All the crumbling bricks and old tiles, broken boards and dilapidated doors are preserved with great care. Even the accumulated dust on the windows and the cobwebs on the lamps are not willing to be wiped away. Visitors either admire its traditional spirit or criticize it for being too conservative. Although it is a matter of opinion and there is no need to force agreement, it is truly commendable to recall the traces of culture and stimulate the feeling of ancient times.</p>
<p>Oxford has 25 male schools and 5 female schools. Each school has its own independent organization and each has its own president. The so-called Oxford University is actually a general term for these 30 schools with different natures and contents. It unifies the examination and the awarding of degrees. In addition to their own dining halls, dormitories, classrooms, and libraries, each school also has its own chapel, with pointed roofs standing like towering peaks, forming a grand spectacle. Among them, the one that was converted from a church into a school 600 years ago is especially magnificent. Walking into the smallest chapel, I discovered the architecture of a famous artist from the 17th century, which was very exquisite.</p>
<p>There is a horizontal table in the dining hall, which is the professor's seat. Below, the dining tables are arranged in straight rows, with students sitting opposite each other. Students must wear uniforms when eating. Teachers and students do not have to be present every day. Each person has their own dormitory, with a study, bedroom, and cleaning room, all beautifully decorated. Students can live outside the school, but they must live in the school for a certain period of time. After a considerable period of indoctrination. The classroom facilities are simple, with few seats. Some students never enter the classroom all year round. There are classrooms where only two or three people sit.</p>
<p>Oxford University professors do not emphasize form, but emphasize spirit and character cultivation. Each student must choose two tutors, one for academics and one for character, emphasizing both academics and character. Sometimes students gather in the professor's home, and the professor smokes a cigar and does not say a word, and the students sit quietly and think, which is leisurely and fascinating, and the indoctrination is also in it. Deep thought and long-term consideration, quiet and leisurely, have the style of an ancient gentleman and the style of a scholar, which cannot be understood by the petty and shallow people of small countries.</p>
<p>As we walked and talked, we saw several professors coming out of the chapel, wearing red, blue, and black robes to distinguish their subjects. The students wear uniforms of varying lengths. There is order in complexity, and unity and harmony in chaos. The thoughts and preferences of teachers and students can be reflected in their clothing.</p>
<p>We visited the naked white stone memorial statue of the poet Shelley who died in the desert; and the writing desk used by the author of the British Dictionary. We also saw the castle built during the Roman occupation. After thousands of years, only the old fortress remains. Actors are filming an ancient play. We entered the library full of volumes, the degree-granting office surrounded by ancient stone statues, and the graduate school for professors to study. Antique in color and full of treasures.</p>
<p>Finally, we took a car around an elegant street, which is the most beautiful street in England. Leisurely and quiet, it adds to the thoughts of the elegant tune of stringed instruments.</p>
<p>The car returned to Xiong's residence at around 2:00 PM. After lunch, we drove back to the city and visited the botanical garden. The garden is too large, so we only chose to visit the tropical plant section. The glass rooms were full of them. The collection is vast and the facilities are complete. In the bitter cold region, tropical plants are transplanted and can thrive. One cannot help but admire the greatness of science and artificiality. Jufang is especially interested in this because she studies agriculture.</p>
<p>Eton School</p>
<p>If Oxford and Cambridge are representative of the highest institutions of learning in England, then Eton College should be the model of secondary education in England. Due to time constraints, I was unable to visit Cambridge. I heard that Cambridge and Oxford are not much different in scale, but I regret not being able to visit them in person. Eton is very worthwhile to visit. Thanks to Military Attaché Lai Wu Mingtang for coming to pick us up, Military Attaché Han Junchang was also happy to go, so we traveled together.</p>
<p>Eton School is a famous aristocratic school, founded in 1440 by King Henry VI of England. Up to now, more than 500 years have passed, and the scenery and appearance remain the same. As for the classrooms, the wooden pillars, wooden walls, and long tables and benches were all made of wood seized when Spain was defeated in 1600. They are antique in color and shiny. The knife carvings are like chaotic threads, either as titles or as arbitrary drawings, which can be compared to our country's "toilet literature." As for the chapel, the antique colors are mottled and are all treasures. The paintings on the walls are all from 1470 and are especially worth appreciating. Each has a memorial hall to commemorate the 1,157 people from the school who sacrificed for the country during World War I. The school has 27 dormitories and many attached houses, currently accommodating 1,130 students. The deep courtyards and winding alleys have deep connotations. The various buildings in the school are either lacking in light or the walls are painted or peeling off. The courtyard inside the gate is paved with gravel and broken bricks, which is uneven and difficult to walk on. Is this to echo the cobwebs and dust on the lamps at the entrance of Oxford University? The conservatism has reached this point, probably to indoctrinate the students, so that they can recall the past and stimulate their feelings of ancient times?</p>
<p>British students are admitted to schools based on exams, not qualifications. They can take the high school entrance exam at the age of 11 and the university entrance exam at the age of 18 (17 during the war), so they often hire private tutors and do not attend primary and secondary schools and take the exam in time. However, the children of nobles mostly attend Eton School. They must register at birth and enter the school at the age of 7. Eton has a very close connection with Oxford and Cambridge. Those who graduate from Eton and study natural sciences mostly enter Cambridge, and those who study social sciences mostly enter Oxford. Oxford and Cambridge are like the continuation of Eton.</p>
<p>Eton School is not famous for its complete facilities or high level of education, but for its special emphasis on appearance and character cultivation, in order to prepare for future diplomatic negotiations and service to the country. As soon as you leave the vicinity of the school, you will see young gentlemen in high hats and swallow-tailed coats walking on the streets. When you come into contact with them, you will feel that they are polite. Those who go from this school to Oxford and Cambridge will easily become great gentlemen and rise to prominence. In the past, the British giants who galloped on the stage and called for wind and rain mostly came from this school. It is said that 17 prime ministers have come from Eton, and other high-ranking officials are too numerous to count. The school is not entirely aristocratic now, but even the uniforms that are often worn are not something that poor children can afford. However, as times change, today's British dignitaries are no longer exclusively occupied by the aristocracy.</p>
<p>Windsor Castle</p>
<p>After visiting Eton School, we visited Windsor Castle. The palace was built in 1583 and is magnificent in scale, resembling a fortress. There are many old cannons inside, three of which are marked as being obtained from the Chinese war, presumably looted during the Eight-Nation Alliance's invasion of Beijing. A part of the palace is designated as a residence for retired officers (who can live there for life). Although there are strict restrictions and it cannot accommodate many people, it is intended to encourage morale and maintain military morale, and the intention is very far-reaching. Unfortunately, it was a Sunday and most of the departments were not open, so I did not have time to visit them all. The guards in the palace were as still as puppets, and the salutes were especially mechanical. The palace is built on a small hill, overlooking the city and village, and the scenery of the gardens is excellent. Although the palace is beautiful, does the Duke of Windsor, who was abandoned without pity, add luster to this palace?</p>
<p>We took a car to visit Windsor Park. The park is about six or seven miles away from the palace, with distant villages and nearby trees, and the scenery is natural. It used to be a hunting ground for the imperial family, but now it is a place for commoners to visit. It is impossible to find the wild boars and deer of the past, but the lush forests and grasses are still worth recalling. The suburbs are clean, the houses are sparse, and the tranquil scenery is abundant.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Nanchang 19th] The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall here was destroyed in the war. Nationalists in Jiangxi raised funds to complete this palace-style building today and renamed it Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. The entire building covers an area of 98 square meters, with vermilion lacquered door pillars and a pair of stone lions, carved beams and painted pillars, showing grandeur and magnificence.

<p>[Our Newspaper Guilin 19th] After the index-based salary adjustment, the provincial government civil servants decided to temporarily suspend layoffs after a provincial affairs meeting, and requested the central government to subsidize according to the index.

<h3 id="e105">Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Rao Xiang Section, Speed up Supplementary Driving Equipment <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Shangrao 15th] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Rao Xiang section route was originally rushed for construction and the funds and materials were exhausted, only to seek its communication first, and everything was not perfect. Since the connection to Nanchang, the Rao Xiang Section Engineering Office has focused on improving the route and supplementing driving equipment. Various general sub-sections were ordered to do road work with all their strength, and rush repair teams and temporary road teams were established to assist in rush repairs to ensure safety. At the same time, the water supply and driving equipment were sped up and supplemented. However, the funds and materials have not yet been fully allocated. Of the 14 billion yuan approved by the Railway Bureau in January, only 9 billion yuan was allocated. Of the 25 billion yuan approved in February, it has not been allocated. In addition, the incentive-based salary final bonus has long been exhausted; materials and tools are also felt to be insufficient. Recently, only 78 hand-pushed flatcars, 52 lifting machines, and 5 hand-cranked cars have been allocated, which is far from the original approved number. Under these circumstances, although the work spirit of the engineering supervisors on the line is still very good, they all feel that it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. Therefore, the Director of the Rao Xiang Section Engineering Office has urgently requested the Railway Bureau to quickly supplement the 30 billion yuan of construction funds that should be supplemented, and allocate 100 flatcars, 30 lifting machines, and 11 hand-cranked cars, along with other tools, in order to speed up the completion of the full line's opening to traffic. Also, the entire Hangzhou-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened to traffic, and all passenger and freight loading and unloading rates and in-station handling rates have been adjusted and implemented from today.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi 17th] Recently, bandits in the four townships have been pretending to be self-defense team members. In the name of catching young men, they have肆意searched villages, causing villagers to have sleepless nights. On the evening of the 14th of this month, in Zhang Daguxiang, Zhouxin Town, Naxiang Town, nine bandits, claiming to be dispatched by the town office to conscript eligible young men, all made up their faces, carried two rifles and one pistol, knocked on doors one by one. The young men in each household heard the sound and scrambled to hide. The bandits took the opportunity to enter and loot, returning fully loaded. The next morning, more than 20 residents of the village, their shock subsiding, inquired each other and realized that they had been deceived. However, the valuable clothing and items of each household had all disappeared. On the evening of the 15th, bandits suddenly visited Linxiang, a neighboring village, and attempted to loot using the same methods. At that time, the residents of the village, knowing that it was a Chang brand, were alerted by the braver ones who climbed onto the roof and rang the gong. The bandits, knowing that the matter was exposed, fled into the water one after another. However, the self-defense teams of nearby townships and towns had already received the news and carried weapons to pursue them, but they were not captured. Yesterday morning, He Wenyuan, the mayor of Nanqiao Town, suddenly received a report that more than 20 refugees from northern Anhui were forcibly plundering and causing trouble door to door in the 15th Bao. He immediately ordered the self-defense team to search and arrest them separately, and unexpectedly captured seven bandits, Zhao Yujian, Liu Futong, Zhang Xinping, Lu Wansen, Zhang Yulian, Fang Lianzhong, etc., in the nearby mulberry fields. After being interrogated by the team leader, they all confessed to the robbery without denial, and have now been transferred to the police station for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>[From our correspondent in Nanchang, 19th] Zhengda University Principal Lin Yimin's determination to resign remains firm. Education Department Director Zhou Bangdao visited and tried to dissuade him on the 18th to no avail. Zhou also telegraphed the Ministry of Education to urge him to stay. Zhengda University's power plant needs light diesel fuel. With the help of various parties, it can now be maintained for three months. The morale of the military in this incident relates to the rectification of the school's atmosphere. Lin does not have ill feelings with the majority of students and faculty. Lin stated that since he took over as president of Zhengda, he has strived to enrich internal facilities and the welfare of staff and students. In the recent half-year, the Ministry of Education has allocated over 2 billion in temporary funds, all of which has been used to repair existing school buildings and add books and equipment, making the faculty lineup much more substantial than in the past. There are now more than 80 professors, 1,263 students in the entire school, and about 40,000 books. Recently, in clearing up past accumulated cases, it was discovered that during Principal Hu Xian's term in the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], a batch of instruments was purchased from the United States, with a value of US$20,000 at the time. These instruments have been stored in Shanghai for several years. It has now been decided to send someone to retrieve them. This is a new initiative since Lin took over at Zhengda, as it had been forgotten because so many years had passed and no one had investigated. Lin concluded by saying that preparations were being made to build a new campus in Lushan. A campus design committee and a campus fundraising committee have now been established. Wang Lingji has agreed to solicit donations from various provinces. Lin also plans to launch a fundraising campaign among domestic and foreign individuals when attending the National Assembly, hoping that people from all walks of life will establish a century-old foundation for Zhengda.</p>

<p>[From our correspondent in Wuxi, 18th] The county tax collection office, in order to simplify the collection method for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] business tax, divided it into eight grades last month and ordered all industries to fill out reports for random inspection to determine the tax amount for each grade. At the beginning of the month, 28 industries, including hotels, silk factories, Chinese medicine shops, cigarette shops, steel, and native tobacco, submitted their lists. After receiving the lists, the tax office immediately sent personnel to conduct random inspections, while at the same time setting a deadline for industries that had not yet reported to do so. At that time, it was approaching the end of the lunar year, and various industries expressed dissatisfaction. Upon seeing this, the tax office suspended the process. Today (the 18th), the tax office sent out a large number of staff again to audit the account books of Chinese medicine shops, silk factories, steel, cigarette, and native tobacco industries. In the afternoon, the audit reached the most bustling area of North Main Street. At Tongfeng Timber Company, the manager happened to be in Shanghai on business, and the staff did not dare to take responsibility, so the account books could not be inspected. The auditors ordered a daily settlement and set a three-day deadline for submitting the account books, but to no avail. They immediately stated that they would come again for inspection at 8:00 a.m. the next morning. It is unknown how, but this caused a misunderstanding. Instantly, all the shops on North Main Street closed early. Before long, shops in the surrounding areas also closed one after another. The auditors who were conducting inspections elsewhere had no choice but to return and report the situation. After learning about this, the reporter set out to investigate and saw that the shops were silent and unanimous in their attitude, with no disturbances.</p>

<p>[From our correspondent in Wujin, 18th] A certain youth army unit of the 23rd Suppression Command stationed in the Qishuyan district, together with the local security team and local militia, has blockaded Furongwei on all sides.

<h3 id="e115">Focus of Mass Organization and Training: Strict Baojia System <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[From our correspondent in Nanchang, 17th, via airmail] The general principles of mass organization and training in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi were detailed in yesterday's dispatch. Regarding general mass organization and training, a strict baojia system will be implemented. The measures are roughly as follows: (1) Conduct household registration checks; (2) Organize household registers and national identification cards; (3) Implement joint guarantee and joint responsibility agreements; (4) Implement joint guarantee agreements for township and baojia chiefs; (5) Establish covert voluntary surveillance; (6) Establish a police network in all cities and towns; (7) Conduct household registration checks and organization, and implement surveillance. Provinces, cities, and counties</p>
<p>should strengthen and enrich existing people's organizations such as farmers' associations, labor unions, chambers of commerce, education associations, elders' associations, journalists' guilds, women's associations, veterans' associations, drama industry associations, various industry guilds, and various hometown associations. Organizations that have not yet been established should be organized immediately, taking into account the actual situation, and assistance and guidance should be provided separately. Training should be conducted in stages, and meetings should be convened from time to time to expose the crimes of bandits and spies, publicize government laws and regulations, and inquire about the presence of hidden bandits and spies within these organizations, so that they can cooperate with the bandit suppression military operations and participate in the suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<p>Provincial, county, and municipal governments should also convene cadres from various people's organizations to conduct short-term training, lecturing on the meaning and laws of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, preventing spies, and how to lead the general public, assist the army in suppressing bandits and preventing bandits, and consolidate local order, so that they can truly understand reality and serve with dedication.</p>
<p>In provinces, cities, and counties where prostitution has not been banned, brothel industry associations should be organized to unify the management and training of their members, so that brothel personnel have a sense of maintaining social order and paying attention to spies and criminals, and to inspect from time to time whether there are hidden bandits and spies active within.</p>
<p>Senior middle school students and primary school teachers in each province, city, and county should be organized into</p>
<p>youth work teams according to their schools. Junior high school students should be organized into youth work auxiliary teams, and personnel should be dispatched regularly to guide their military training and provide training through seminars, group discussions, and current affairs discussions.</p>
<p>Collect and train out-of-school youths from bandit areas. Provinces should conduct investigations and registrations, designate appropriate locations, conduct district-based training, and assist them in returning to school, transferring to other schools, or finding employment. When necessary, they should also be led to participate in the work of suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<p>Train workers in various industries, such as dock workers, cart drivers, sedan chair carriers, boatmen, teahouse, restaurant, hotel, and bathhouse workers, etc. According to their distribution areas, they should be gathered and trained regularly within the scope of their</p>
<p>labor, so that they have an awareness of maintaining society and cooperating in preventing spies. Opportunity should be taken to organize them separately into various task forces such as stretcher transport and engineering to meet military needs.</p>
<p>Provincial, city, and county civil servants should have their training methods formulated by each province. All civil servants in various agencies, regardless of gender, should be trained, and the heads of each unit should be personally responsible for supervision and guidance.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization and management of refugees, the local party, government, and public opinion organizations should organize</p>
<p>refugee guidance offices. For refugees entering various localities, except for those who already have fixed occupations and are incorporated into the baojia system, the rest should be designated locations, centrally organized, and issued refugee certificates for management, repatriation, and the dispatch of personnel to provide life guidance, job introductions, and handle refugee spy prevention work.</p>
<p>Beggars and vagrants should also be managed separately and given job introductions as appropriate. The old, weak, disabled, and those unable to support themselves should be assisted and accommodated by the social affairs bureaus of each province and city. Civilian vocational training centers should be established so that beggars and unemployed vagrants can learn a livelihood and be able to support themselves independently.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of mass organization and training in the current stage of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation is to stabilize areas by mobilizing the masses, utilizing manpower, and preventing espionage to assist the army. In areas adjacent to bandit areas, the focus is on how to lead self-defense forces, strictly organize local organizations, prevent sporadic bandit activity, and assist the army in suppression.

<p>[From our correspondent in Nanjing, 19th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received a report from the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction stating that the gold mining areas previously held by the Gold Mining Bureau in Hunan have long been inactive. It was requested that they be opened up to facilitate private operation. The Ministry has now verified that these gold mining areas were approved for preliminary exploitation by the bureau in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Gold Mining during Extraordinary Periods. If the procedures for applying for mining rights were not completed by the end of March of the 35th year of the Republic [i.e., 1946], the original cases can be cancelled separately, and people can be allowed to mine according to law, in order to increase gold production.</p>

Unexpectedly, Zhou suddenly gathered a crowd to cause trouble, destroying the station's desks, benches, and glass, and severely beating and injuring the ticket inspector Guan Jie. The station immediately telegraphed the county government, which dispatched police to suppress the situation and arrested Zhou A'lai, the leader, and transferred him to the district procuratorate for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Death of Air Force Hero: Gao Youxin, Continued from Page 2 <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>One early spring evening in the Northeast, snowflakes were falling. The elevator of a certain large building in Shenyang was ascending, but the door of the elevator was broken. After the elevator ascended, the door remained open. A junior officer was standing at the door, waiting for the elevator to come down. At this time, an Air Force Major entered from outside the door. The night was hazy, and the lights in the room were not very bright, but the junior officer who was already in the room recognized that this was Squadron Leader Gao Youxin and immediately stood at attention and saluted. Gao Youxin returned the salute. He saw that the door of the elevator was open and thought that his subordinate was letting him enter the elevator first. So, he took a step forward. Immediately, a sound of something heavy falling was heard loudly. Gao Youxin fell down, falling quite deeply. His head was bleeding, and his brain nerves suffered extreme shock. He lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Shenyang lacked medical equipment, so he was sent to Beiping for treatment. Mrs. Gao was by his side, and his condition seemed to improve a bit. At this time, he resigned from his position as Squadron Leader of the Fourth Squadron and was reassigned as a staff officer of the Air Force Headquarters. Later, he went south from Beiping to Mrs. Gao's hometown, the banks of the Xiang River—Changsha, Hunan to continue recuperating. A year passed, and his condition improved even more. For the sake of a quick recovery, in the summer of the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947], Gao Youxin, who was injured, was sent by the Air Force Headquarters to the United States for further treatment. He lived in the home of Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief General Mao Bangchu in the United States, where his life was stable, and he could focus on medical treatment. After examination by famous American doctors, it was felt that his illness did not require surgery and would slowly get better. Mrs. Gao in her hometown of Changsha often received telegrams, which were very comforting. After half a year in the United States, Gao Youxin had almost completely returned to normal and had gained much more weight than before. General Mao Bangchu smiled and said to him, "I think you can take on a new position again."</p>
<p>Everyone was looking forward to a new Gao Youxin. In December of the 36th year of the Republic, he took an American transport ship back to China, traveling for more than forty days. After arriving in Shanghai, he went to his relatives' house at 27 Henry Road. He held several hundred American dollars in his hand and said to his relatives, "Please give these few hundred dollars to Lingling. I'm afraid I won't be able to see her!" After saying that, he looked sad and kept muttering to himself that he had some kind of bad smell. His relatives were very surprised. They offered him accommodation, but he refused, even more so being worried. That night, he was found at the Air Force Xinsheng Society. There he met colleagues who had returned to China with Gao Youxin and learned that the transport ship they were on had encountered a major storm during the journey. Gao Youxin's brain nerves, which had almost recovered, suffered a strong shock again and went wrong.</p>
<p>"This is a kind of phobia. Patients often have feelings of inferiority," said Dr. Su Zonghua, a famous neurologist in Shanghai, when his relatives took him to see him. "I have treated several people with this disease. They need to rest well." Dr. Su estimated that it would take about three to five months. He would need to get injections and take medicine every day and should hire two special nurses to live with him. It would cost about 70 million yuan per month. "This way," he said, "he will get better."</p>
<p>However, Gao Youxin did not immediately do what Dr. Su said. Then, Mrs. Gao rushed from Hunan to Shanghai to meet him. She accompanied him to Nanjing to continue applying for leave to the Air Force Headquarters. The Air Force Headquarters conveniently sent him to the Central Hospital for treatment. Strangely, the doctors at the Central Hospital could not diagnose Gao Youxin's condition. His appetite decreased greatly in the hospital, he lost weight, he only slept, and he didn't want to talk.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gao went back to Shanghai twice. The second time was to come back for the Lunar New Year. She had originally planned to spend the Lunar New Year in Shanghai with Youxin, but Gao Youxin asked a Dr. Ma, "Can I go to Shanghai for the New Year?" Dr. Ma said, "How can you even think about celebrating the New Year in your condition!" As a doctor, he didn't know that some things should be avoided in front of patients, or at least should be said more tactfully. This sentence was so painful to Youxin's wounded heart!</p>
<p>So, Mrs. Gao returned to Shanghai alone to spend the Lunar New Year at her relatives' house. She looked worried. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, she received a phone call from Youxin in Nanjing, and her mood was slightly relieved. On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Youxin, who was alone in Nanjing, went to his uncle Gao Yongen's house to pay a New Year's visit. Only his aunt was at home and made him a cup of tea. Youxin took it in his hand, and the glass cup suddenly shattered. His aunt jokingly said, "This cup of tea was for me to drink anyway."</p>
<p>On February 13 (that is, the fourth day of the Lunar New Year), a friend of Gao Youxin invited him to lunch. After the meal, he sent him back to the hospital. During the New Year, the hospital was cold and deserted. He couldn't stand the loneliness and slipped out alone. He walked to the vicinity of Wulao Bridge. He stopped and took a breath of fresh air. He felt very tired and prepared to return. Not far away, a small train was speeding towards him. He realized that the place where he was standing was too narrow and too close to the tracks. He wanted to jump to the other side of the tracks. He was confident that his long jump skills were very good. But who knew that on an afternoon after a rainy clearing, the soil was loose and he couldn't exert any strength. After he jumped, he fell down, falling right on the tracks. The speeding train pressed on him like Mount Tai. The driver didn't have time to brake, and the wheels had repeatedly run over the body of our air hero. Several hours later, the Central Hospital finally sent a car to pick up the body.</p>
<p>That night, Mrs. Gao in Shanghai received an urgent phone call urging her to go to Nanjing immediately. After she arrived in Beijing, she fainted several times. She was only twenty years old and became a widow! Youxin left her only a daughter who was just one year old.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang read the newspaper in Lushan and learned of Gao Youxin's death, expressing deep sorrow and sending a wreath. Senior officials from various central ministries and commissions also sent wreaths and eulogies. A memorial service was held in Beijing on the 16th, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou personally came to pay his respects. The public burial was scheduled for March 29. The bones of a generation of heroes will be buried in the Cemetery of Air Force Martyrs behind Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum!</p>
<p>Gao Youxin's mother now lives in Tianjin. His sister is not yet married and is the director of a nursery at Tianjin National Normal College. One younger brother is studying at university in Tianjin. His mother is over sixty years old this year. We can imagine how sad and angry she was when she heard of the death of her beloved son!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The fifth day of the National Catholic Education Conference continued on Friday morning in the auditorium of Aurora College for Women in Shanghai. Professor Tang Bolian from the Wuhu Major Seminary gave a speech on "The Achievements of Chinese Christianity in Missionary Work and Education." Ms. Su Xuelin, a professor at National Wuhan University, gave a speech on "The Position of Mandarin Chinese in Catholic Schools." She believes that middle school Chinese language education should focus on vernacular language to cultivate students' writing ability. Classical Chinese should teach famous works after the Song Dynasty, especially the works of Liang Qichao and others, which are clear in meaning and suitable for modern thought, and should be selected as teaching materials or extracurricular reading materials. She believes that the Bible and Chairman Chiang's "Destiny of China" are the best, but the translation style of the Bible should be improved and a popular vernacular style should be adopted. Mr. Melville, Secretary of the US Embassy in Nanjing, attended the conference in the afternoon and gave a speech, calling communism "an iron helmet covering human thought."  When mentioning the cooperation between China and the United States, Mr. Melville said that the American people have the sincerity to assist China, but China itself must generate an inner spiritual spark before assistance can be given. Dr. Tan Renmei, General Secretary of the Chinese Christian Education Association, gave a speech at the conference, detailing the history, work and plans of the Chinese Christian Education Association, and expressed that cooperation and research are still needed in the future. Dr. Shao Heting, a professor at Central University, gave a speech on "Moral Education and Catholicism," believing that the key to solving China's problems is that moral education is more important than material welfare.</p>

<p>[British News Agency, London, 19th Dispatch] The Chinese Committee of various universities here recently announced a report on the work of the Chinese lectureships at Oxford and Cambridge Universities, showing that British universities are increasingly interested in research on various Chinese subjects. Xu Shi, Associate Professor of Chinese Religion and Philosophy at Oxford, said in his report: "At the end of the last academic year, there were only two degree students. Four new students were added at the beginning of the new academic year, and two more students were added this semester, making a total of eight. Six of them had studied Chinese or Japanese, and one had studied both Chinese and Japanese. All the students are intelligent and have different responses to the initial exposure to language, history, philosophy, and fine literature. They also show active interest in Chinese art. Two people plan to specialize in early Chinese history and related archaeological discoveries. Professor Helong, Professor of Chinese Language and History at Cambridge, reported: "The number of students continues to increase to nine, and the distribution is more balanced. Five are undergraduates and four are graduate students. Three Chinese government scholarships will be restored next semester. The library facilities have been significantly improved because the rare books collected by the National Peking Library, which were stored in the Library of Congress during the war, have been photographed into a complete set of miniature slides. Cambridge has obtained one copy. The film is more than 100,000 feet long and divided into 1,070 volumes. The content is about 40,000 copies of manuscripts or printed books up to the early 17th century. Most of the original copies have been purchased. In addition, the library only has 200 Chinese books and manuscripts, and 120 Japanese books. The Japanese and Modern Chinese lecturers were respectively filled by Mr. Sittell and Ms. Yang Wangyuan (transliteration), an English lecturer at Peking University, last year."</p>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 18th Dispatch] News from Liverpool says that friends of Chinese Church Universities held a meeting in the British Cultural Committee Building. The speakers included Ms. Yifa, a British teacher at Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, and Mr. Hou, who is currently conducting research at the University of Liverpool. The meeting suggested that in order to make the late Professor Rosper, the former representative of the British Cultural Committee in China, immortal, a fund should be donated to establish a chair in the Chinese university with which Professor Luo had a relationship during his lifetime, because Professor Luo was originally from Liverpool.</p>

<h3 id="e141">St. John's University Rectifies School Spirit; Limits Students to Written Answers to Four Questions <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] As the winter vacation is about to end, schools are preparing for the new semester. St. John's University in this city has not yet decided on the opening date due to the issue of rectifying the school spirit. The school was originally scheduled to open on the 17th of this month, but was later planned to be changed to the 23rd due to some reason. However, the school has not officially announced it as of yesterday. The school's board of directors, administrative meeting, and faculty meeting have held multiple meetings to discuss this issue. They all believe that the school cannot be stable at present, and would rather delay the opening date to actively rectify the school spirit. The board of directors stated that if necessary, the school will be temporarily suspended. The suspension time is authorized to the school authorities to be determined based on the school's stability. The school previously issued a "Letter to Students' Parents" asking them to admonish students not to participate in extracurricular activities, and a "Letter to All Students" (see below), limiting them to answering the following four questions in writing by tomorrow, otherwise, it will be regarded as automatic withdrawal: (1) Can the student union represent your personal opinions? (2) Do you need the student union? (3) Should the student union constitution be approved by the school? (4) Are you willing to abide by the oath you took when you entered the school? The original text of the school's letter to all students is as follows: "Our school takes light and truth as its motto, and refines academics to cultivate talents as its purpose. In-class assignments and extracurricular activities complement each other, and there is freedom of speech and assembly within the school's norms. Unfortunately, during the winter vacation on January 29, some students voluntarily participated in the Tongji University incident. Then, at the graduation ceremony held by our school on January 31, the student union staff did not consult with the school in advance, and rashly, at the request of a few students, used coercive means to force the school to allow its representatives to enter the venue and report on the Tongji incident. On the next day, without the school's permission, they convened off-campus students to hold a meeting on campus. This kind of action not only clearly violates the school rules, but also violates the school's purpose of running the school. In addition to the student union bearing full responsibility for this, in order to rectify the school spirit and benefit the students, our school specially asks you to answer the following questions (see above) before the next semester starts. We hope that each student will mail the answers with your name to the principal's office of our school before the 21st of this month. This matter concerns the future of each student's studies, so you must pay close attention. If you discard it and do not reply, you do not need to come to the school to register next semester."</p>
<p>The meeting also stipulated the number of students per class in municipal night schools: (1) Each ordinary elementary, intermediate, and advanced class must recruit 50 students to open a class, and the number of students in class at ordinary times must be more than 30. (2) Each vocational class must recruit 40 students to open a class, and the number of students in class at ordinary times must be more than 25. Classes that do not meet the above standards will not be opened.</p>

Both foreign soldiers were defeated.</p>
<p>Qingbai Defeats American Military Police</p>
<p>In the first game between Qingbai and the American Military Police, after the touch, the American soldiers, Mr. Smith, scored under the basket, scoring the first basket. Qingbai A Cai immediately returned the favor. At that time, the American soldiers seemed to be divinely helped, and Xiao successively scored to lead 8-2. Qingbai counterattacked, Zhuo Guorong made a free throw, and Xianglong Dayun Baokun broke through the basket one after another to exceed 9-8. Afterwards, the two sides fought back and forth, and the scores fluctuated, which was quite tense. After 16 ties, there was a close situation of 21-20. The first half ended, and Qingbai took the lead by one point with 24-22. Changing places to fight again, Qingbai fully attacked, and Xianglong Dayun Junbing all had wonderful structures. The score difference gradually increased. After 31-22, the American soldiers showed a slight rise, but Qingbai's pressure was not relaxed, and they led all the way. When time ran out, Qingbai defeated the American Military Police 65-42.</p>

Fushan scored a free throw, Adi scored, and Xiangcheng broke through the basket to get a lot of points. At 11-3, the Air Force changed generals, but there was still no turning point. Hualian still led until the end of the first half, with Hualian leading 29-14. After the break, the two formations rounded again. Xue Chong and Song Yuan fell and added four points. The foreign soldiers immediately changed generals, but it was still ineffective. Xue Chong and Fushan successively made free throws, and Song Yuan added icing on the cake, leading remotely with 37-14. Li Meng broke through the basket, and Song Yuan immediately pulled back. After 55-32, Hualian Zhang Liangxiong replaced Bao Songyuan, and the foreign soldiers took the opportunity to rise and gained a little, but soon the overall situation was manipulated by Hualian again. In the last two or three minutes, Hualian was not too much, and Bowler O'Neill scored four goals in a row, and finally lost to Hualian 50-64.</p>

In order to meet the needs, the school first established a middle school on the original site of the sports school, which has been running for three semesters. Because the environment is quiet and the management is serious, the students are very developed. The original four-story western-style building at No. 4 Ximen Daji Road of the school has also been recovered, and a second campus has been added, with an attached primary school department and kindergarten. This semester, the two campuses will expand enrollment at the same time and set up 100 free places for poor students. All outstanding youths from poor families can apply for free tuition.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Grand Occasion of the Winter World Games: 28 Countries Participate with Thousands of Male and Female Athletes Competing for Championships in the Snowy Swiss Alps <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Switzerland] In February 1948, the Fifth Winter World Games were held in the village of St. Moritz in the Swiss mountains. Due to the difficulty in purchasing foreign exchange, travelers from various countries were short on funds. Although the number of visiting tourists was not as large as the Second Winter Games in 1928 before the war, the opening ceremony on January 30th at 10:00 AM, led by Swiss President Celio, was attended by as many as 915 male and female athletes from 28 countries across five continents. Raising flags and torches, they paraded in formation, their colors bright and their attire splendid, creating a grand and memorable moment. The competitions, lasting for nine days, were divided into the following eighteen categories:</p>
<p>Competition Programs</p>
<p>(1) Ice Hockey, with the most frequent matches, held daily; (2) Men's and Women's Individual Figure Skating; (3) Mixed Pair Figure Skating; (4) 500-meter (half-kilometer) Speed Skating; (5) 1.5-kilometer Speed Skating; (6) 5-kilometer Speed Skating; (7) 10-kilometer Speed Skating (the above seven items are on ice); (8) Skeleton Speed Racing; (9) Two-Man Bob-Sleigh Races; (10) Four-Man Bob-Sleigh Racing; (11) 18-kilometer Cross-Country Skiing; (12) 50-kilometer Skiing Cross-Country; (13) 40-kilometer Skiing Relay Race (10 kilometers per person); (14) Men's and Women's Individual Downhill Race; (15) Slalom Race; (16) Ski Jumping (the above three items have individual and combined events); (17) Skiing Military Patrol and Shooting; (18) Skiing Cross-Country, Downhill, Shooting, Fencing, and Equestrian Five-Event Competition (the above eleven items are on snow).</p>
<p>Ice Hockey Abandoned</p>
<p>An unfortunate incident occurred at the beginning of the competition: two ice hockey teams from the United States arrived to participate, but they could not reach an agreement. The host country was unable to mediate, so this event had to be abandoned. The Swiss ice hockey players were also unable to showcase their skills, and everyone felt like heroes without a battlefield. Although the Soviet Union did not formally send a team of athletes to this Winter Games, they selected ten sports experts, male and female representatives, and flew from Prague to St. Moritz to observe.</p>
<p>Worthy of Promotion</p>
<p>Our great country, China, has many famous mountains with snow in winter. If we could once hold Winter Games competitions, it would attract tourists from all over the world and create new opportunities for national benefit and people's welfare through intangible exports. The advantages are countless. It would not only promote health and cultivation internally but also promote prosperity and culture externally. The way the local authorities in the Swiss mountain village managed this event, the ski runs and horse trails, the hockey and skating rinks, the 50-kilometer straight-run ski trail, the ski military patrol trail with the highest point at 3,000 meters above sea level, the slopes and jumps for downhill and jumping combined competitions, the special station for the latest sports medicine, and the more than 800 wireless army stations in the high mountains and deep valleys for broadcasting reporters to report on the spot – the layout and planning of these facilities are something that enthusiastic entrepreneurs should take the opportunity to pay attention to and study in advance.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Import Quota List for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons: Officially Announced by the Import Control Commission; Average Number is About 30% Less Than the Fourth Season <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Import Control Commission officially announced yesterday the import quota list for goods in Category (II) of the Fifth and Sixth Seasons (February to July of the 37th year). Shen Zouing, Director of the Quota Allocation Office of the Commission, received reporters at the Bank of China at 3:30 PM and provided supplementary explanations on the import quota list for this period. The main points are: Diesel, wool, rubber, lubricating oil, and lubricating grease, various unregistered vegetable tanning extracts, washed film, and other items in the quota list for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons are about the same as in the Fourth Season. Cotton, grain, coal, Chilean nitrate, sulfuric acid, and other fertilizers are not included and will be determined by the government based on national needs. In addition, the import quotas for other goods are smaller than in the Fourth Season. The lack of foreign exchange funds both inside and outside the government has made it necessary to reduce quotas, which is unavoidable. The average number for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons is superficially about 30% less than in the Fourth Season, but if the excluded goods are included, the actual reduction is only a little over 10%. The combined publication of the import quotas for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons has two purposes: one is to coordinate with the national budget, and the other is to publish it every six months so that manufacturers can make longer-term plans. Whether import quotas should be directly allocated to factories or transferred by importers depends on the nature of the imported goods. For goods with scattered users inland, which cannot be directly allocated to factories, they are allocated to importers, such as film, gasoline, lumber, and hardware. Conversely, goods such as wool and wood pulp can be directly allocated to factories. Regarding the rumors that some importers sell quotas for profit, Shen believes that this is impossible because the Commission is very strict in registering importers. Registered importers must have regular business dealings abroad, and the current quotas are based on certain criteria. The issuance of licenses must be based on purchase contracts, so there is little possibility of fraud. The detailed figures for the quota allocation of various imported goods are attached below: (Unit: Thousands of US Dollars)</p>
<p>Goods Amount</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Rice Market Management Committee received instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to change the method of selling rice. The details are as follows: (1) From now on, the amount of rice allocated to each rice shop for sale should be based on the quantity listed in the daily sales reports submitted in December of the 36th year. (2) The amount of rice allocated to each rice shop for sale should be based on the average daily sales quantity reported in December of the 36th year. (3) Rice shops that have not obtained a grain dealer business license or have not submitted daily or monthly reports in the past will not be allocated rice.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The rice market continues to rise. Yesterday morning, due to the high price of rice from Wuxi, the market price limit was raised to 1.95 million yuan. People remained anxious, and owners raised prices again. The early rice market opened at 2.09 million yuan. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau began to sell rice and changed the method to allocate rice according to the average daily sales quantity of each rice shop in December. The standard for wholesalers was the sales quantity reported in December, and the price remained at 1.75 million yuan. In this way, the allocated amount was sufficient for needs, and people's minds were relieved. There were many who sold, and the market declined. Early rice retreated to 2.05 million yuan, white glutinous rice was traded at 2.12 million yuan, and thin rice and Xiang rice were each at 2.1 million yuan. White Yuan reached as high as 2.25 million yuan, still 350,000 yuan higher than the previous days. At the close of the market, due to the strong rise in miscellaneous grains, the market situation became even tighter, and owners stopped selling again. According to inquiries in the afternoon, more than 12,000 piculs of rice were allocated yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour, Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Flour and bran are rising sharply, because the price in Wuxi has risen, which has affected this place. Owners rarely sell, and retailers are eager to buy, not hesitating to pay high prices, so owners are shouting prices to the sky. Old car flour opened at 960,000 yuan and once reached the 1 million yuan mark, eventually trading at 980,000 yuan. Naval vessel flour was 970,000 yuan, a huge jump of 100,000 yuan each from the previous day. Although there were not many transactions, the market was very strong. Bran also rose sharply by about 100,000 yuan. A large bag of bran was 620,000 yuan in the morning and even higher at 630,000 yuan in the afternoon. Wheat factory price was 1.3 million yuan. The edible oil market, due to the sharp rise in Wuxi, affected the Shanghai market. Owners were shouting prices to the sky, and there was an unprecedented surge.

<p>Recently, the foreign tea market has been in a state of quietness. The reason is that the production cost of Chinese tea continues to increase, while the price of tea abroad is gradually decreasing. Under this situation, exports cannot recover.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous outflow of domestic fancy teas from this street and Hakka merchants, the buying interest remains strong. However, buyers are hoarding goods due to scarcity, and the asking price is becoming more and more aggressive. At the close of the market, negotiations between the two sides had not yet been successful, and transactions were difficult to carry out. However, the momentum remained the same, and the market rebounded again.</p>

<p>In order to cooperate with the control of finance, tighten credit, and strengthen the implementation of preventing excessive concentration of inland funds in cities, the Ministry of Finance has formulated four management measures for remittances and cash transportation from various places to Shanghai and Guangzhou, in order to avoid hindering the circulation of funds for legitimate industrial and commercial activities. It is learned that the above measures have been ordered by the local Financial Management Bureau to be implemented from the 21st, and a public notice was issued on the 20th, ordering all banks and companies to comply. The contents of the measures are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For remittances from local national bank branches, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks to Shanghai and Guangzhou, and remittances from national bank branches, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks in Shanghai and Guangzhou, if the total amount exceeds 200 million, the details should be listed daily and sent to the local Financial Management Bureau or the local Central Bank for verification. The Financial Management Bureau or the Central Bank may notify the remitting bank to stop accepting remittances from a certain remitter or to stop paying to a certain payee if deemed necessary.</p>
<p>(2) The amount of funds that local national bank branches, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks request from the Central Bank for interbank transfers each month should be directly negotiated with the local Central Bank.</p>
<p>(3) For those who transport cash from the inland to Shanghai and Guangzhou, each person shall not exceed 100 million yuan. The inspectors will return the excess part to the local Central Bank for deposit in a special account, issuing a three-month fixed deposit certificate, which will be returned upon maturity. This provision applies equally to silver and money companies.</p>
<p>(4) For those who cannot remit or transfer funds through banks for legitimate purposes and must carry cash to Shanghai and Guangzhou, they may apply to the local Financial Management Bureau for a cash transportation certificate, which can be carried with the certificate and is not subject to the above restrictions. However, this application can be handled at the local Central Bank in places where there is no Financial Management Bureau. The cash transportation certificates issued by the Financial Management Bureau or the local Central Bank should be reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The 21-count current Double Horse yarn, after opening at 50 million yuan, rose sharply due to the strong pull from Hakka merchants, and the market rose to 54 million yuan. Near the close of noon, the authorities in charge of spinning and construction, in view of the endless rising wind, once again listed prices and accepted applications from the industry. Because people in the industry felt slightly strained due to repeated suspensions, market sentiment turned to release, and table gangs and short sellers also took advantage of the situation to sell off, and the asking price turned sharply down.</p>

<p>Shanghai stocks initially rose yesterday following the increase in commodity prices, but lacking buying support, investors began to liquidate their positions. Bearish forces seized the opportunity to intensify their short selling. National banks' price differentials widened further, causing stocks to fall from their highs.

<p>Yesterday, the coal market saw a strong performance from street vendors due to disruptions in the supply of goods.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened steadily. Subsequently, due to strong demand from Hankou and Nanjing merchants, industry players and individual investors frequently engaged in speculative bidding. Powerful players and dyeing factories showed strong appetite, causing the prices of various cloths to rise again. Later, around 10:30 AM, it was reported that Textile Building Company, in order to meet market demand, supplied a large quantity of goods, with six grades of fine cloth and serge being listed. Sentiment turned weak, and the market slightly recovered.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Talking About Special Home Nursing <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Long</p>
<p>Due to lifestyle habits and various other reasons, Chinese people generally prefer to stay at home when they are sick rather than staying in the hospital. There are many pros and cons to this, which cannot be fully described at once. For example, home is always more comfortable than the hospital, and the care of loved ones is always better than the care of nurses. However, the facilities at home are not suitable for medical treatment, and the care of loved ones cannot cope with changes in symptoms. In that case, staying in the hospital is better. Therefore, in order to adapt to this contradictory need of patients, the so-called special home nursing came into being. Indeed, for the sake of the patient, it is extremely worthwhile. They can comfortably stay at home and enjoy the care of their loved ones, while also compensating for various medical and health shortcomings. That is truly ideal.</p>
<p>However, the reality often contradicts the ideal, especially in the case of this type of special home nursing. Although many of them are formally graduated from nursing schools or have been trained in large hospitals for many years, the quality of most special nurses is very low. Not to mention that they completely lack all basic medical knowledge, they do not even understand the patient's psychology. And the most intolerable thing is that they have no sense of responsibility for the patient's health. Regardless of the changes in the patient's condition, they are always indifferent and do not know to remind the patient or the patient's relatives, let alone report to the doctor. Sometimes, they even criticize the doctor's treatment in an arrogant manner or recommend some secret remedies to the patient.</p>
<p>We must not underestimate that the actions of these special nurses are harmless to both the patient and the doctor! In reality, they can invisibly ruin patients who have good prospects of recovery. Therefore, I loudly call for the reconstruction of special home nursing, and I hope that the health authorities will ban it or improve it!</p>
<h3 id="e173">Methods to Promote Breast Milk <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Manqing</p>
<p>According to a report by Dr. M. Robinsan of St. Thomas Hospital in London, he conducted a practical study of various secretion conditions during the breastfeeding period of postpartum women in 500 cases. He believed that giving a large amount of thyreoicea sicca can certainly promote increased milk secretion, but using Lugol's solution (i.e., giving the postpartum woman six drops of Lrgol's Lolution twice a day, with oral administration in milk) can further strengthen milk secretion. As for the use of other endocrine hormones to increase milk secretion, the effect is very minimal. Of course, we can use endocrine hormones (such as Oetragen) to increase milk, but it can only be used within four days after childbirth. And if the dosage is not handled carefully, not only will the milk not increase, but the milk will decrease. Robinson also said that if milk can reach 285 cc on the fifth day after delivery, and 455 cc on the tenth day, there is no need to worry about reduced milk secretion in the next six months. Ordinary treatment for insufficient milk secretion should start on the sixth day after delivery. If the milk volume is less than 285 cc, it should be treated immediately without further delay. As for the calculation method of the milk volume, it is very simple. Just use a scale to calculate the baby's weight before and after breastfeeding, and the exact number can be measured. In addition, in order to know the actual situation of the milk volume, another test should be carried out after the fourth week of breastfeeding, so as to find a way to maintain its original level. Robinson selected 27 out of 99 cases suffering from insufficient milk syndrome for treatment with Lugol's solution (this solution contains 5% iodine and 10% potassium iodide). The remaining patients were either massaged to promote milk secretion, or injected with isotonic physiological saline (one cc injected into the muscles every other day, for a total of five injections), or no treatment was given at all, in order to compare the above methods. As for those taking the above-mentioned Lugol's solution, they were instructed to take it every day until the daily milk volume reached 455 cc (which usually takes about seven days). Among them, seven people voluntarily gave up breastfeeding because their nipples were very painful when breastfeeding, so it was impossible to test the effectiveness of Lugol's solution. Also, in these seven people, some people's milk volume was not accurately calculated and was not recognized as a test object. In addition, one of them had a very painful lump in the breast, which became more painful 24 hours after taking Lugol's solution. From this it can be inferred that such patients should certainly not take Lugol's solution. However, if this lump can be dispersed by taking smg Oesrrogen orally every four hours, then Lugol's solution can also be given later to promote milk secretion without causing lumps to recur.</p>
<p>After implementing the above-mentioned tests, those who took Lugol's solution orally had 456 cc of milk on the twelfth day (approximately equal to the secretion volume of a normal healthy parturient). Those using breast massage had only 314 cc, those using isotonic physiological saline injections had 156 cc, and those who did not receive any treatment had 171 cc. Also, after the fourth week of the above methods, those using Lugol's solution had 598 cc (the secretion volume of a healthy parturient should be 710 cc at this time), those using massage had 313 cc, those using isotonic saline had 342 cc, and those who did not add any treatment still had 171 cc, but they had no intention of breastfeeding their children. What is most noteworthy is that all those who have taken Lugol's solution containing iodine have never had any iodine side effects. And the children they nourished all grew up and were healthy. However, one of the postpartum women only had a few drops of milk within seven days after delivery, and the breast was swollen and became lumpy from the second day after delivery. Therefore, Oetroen was given orally from the third day after delivery, and it softened as usual from the seventh day. Then, iodine was continued, and by the thirteenth day, there was already 200 cc of milk.</p>
<p>In addition, there were a total of nine cases suffering from too little milk secretion, all of whom were given an iodine solution at the end of the puerperium. (Take 0.6cc orally three times a day with oral administration in milk). About three weeks later, the children of three people could survive entirely on their mother's milk. Also, among the nine people, only one case seemed to be ineffective.</p>
<p>According to the above experiments, the reason why milk secretion is insufficient seems to be greatly related to the lack of continuine and the obstruction of ovarian secretion. Ovarian preparations can be used to treat it in the first four days after delivery. The so-called breast swelling, becoming lumpy, and having thick, yellowish milk is due to the obstruction of ovarian secretion. If the breast is soft and empty, it is due to lack of iodine. Therefore, giving iodine when ovarian secretion is obstructed is certainly ineffective, and iodine can only be effective after ovarian secretion is normal. According to the author's report, this method of promoting increased milk secretion not only does not harm the baby, but also has nothing to do with the parturient (see the British Medical Journal 451600 Brit. M. J. 1947, 4516 in 1947).</p>
<h3 id="e174">Defense Against Tuberculosis <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>Now I will introduce several early symptoms as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Colds that last for more than five weeks without improvement, persistent coughs that don't stop.</p>
<p>2.  Afternoon fever, flushed cheeks, night sweats, occasional cough (short and small sound) without phlegm.</p>
<p>3.  Weight loss, physical weakness.</p>
<p>4.  Hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, back pain.</p>
<p>5.  Sudden hemoptysis, or a history of hemoptysis.</p>
<p>6.  Indigestion, loss of appetite, reduced food intake.</p>
<p>7.  Feeling tired after only slight exertion.</p>
<p>8.  Coughing up phlegm gradually upon waking up in the morning, feeling tired for no reason.</p>
<p>Anyone who discovers any of the above situations should immediately consult a specialist doctor for examination. It is best to use X-ray fluoroscopy of the chest. If, after examination, it is not tuberculosis, then you are lucky; if unfortunately you have lung disease, then you should have great determination to seek medical treatment, absolutely follow the doctor's instructions, and only then is there hope of recovery.</p>
<p>(6) Defense Against Tuberculosis</p>
<p>China is the country with the highest prevalence of tuberculosis in the world. The prevalence is rampant and the impact is huge. It is truly a decisive factor for national strength and survival. Fifty years ago, it was mostly the same in European and American countries. Since then, tuberculosis transmission has gradually decreased, and progress has been particularly rapid in recent years. Taking the United States as an example, the tuberculosis mortality rate was nearly 400 people ninety years ago. In 1900, the death rate was 202 per 100,000 people, and the mortality rate gradually decreased thereafter. Calculated every ten years, the first decade decreased by 20 percent; the second decade decreased by 23 percent; the third decade decreased by 33 percent; the fourth decade decreased by 34 percent. Until 1940, its mortality rate was only 45 per 100,000. They are also planning to prepare to eradicate tuberculosis and continue to reduce the tuberculosis mortality rate. It is estimated that in 1950 it will be 32 percent, in 1960 it will be 21 percent, in 1970 it will be 14 percent, and in 1980 it will be 10 percent. After 2000, tuberculosis can be eradicated in the United States. Because tuberculosis is indeed a preventable and controllable disease. In the past, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death from disease in European and American countries, but now it has dropped to seventh or eighth place. If our country does a good job in defense and prevents the spread of this contact disease, improves the social environment, increases resistance to tuberculosis, and reduces the prevalence of this disease, and works together, then the problem of tuberculosis will not be difficult to solve and can achieve practical results.</p>
<p>I. Defensive Principles:</p>
<p>(1) Early detection, reporting, diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of tuberculosis patients.</p>
<p>(2) Preventing the spread of infection and reducing the chance of infection.</p>
<p>(3) Preventing the multiplication and spread of tubercle bacilli that invade the human body.</p>
<p>(4) Increasing the patient's resistance, improving nutrition, and providing a good living environment.</p>
<p>V. Promote methods of preventive immunization.</p>
<p>VI. Defensive work should be implemented universally and strictly by government administrative power.</p>
<p>II. Defense Methods:</p>
<p>I. Defense Against Transmission:</p>
<p>(1) Health education: The general public in our country lacks basic health knowledge. Furthermore, they do not understand the characteristics, transmission, prevention, rest, and recuperation of tuberculosis. They act willfully, resulting in wider spread and more intense transmission. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that people have a correct understanding in order to make defense easier. Habits such as spitting everywhere should be especially corrected, which will be of great benefit.</p>
<p>(2) Tuberculosis Reporting: Preventing disease is better than treating it. To defend against transmission and reduce the chance of infection, implement reporting of tuberculosis patients publicly. Conduct strict examinations of early-stage patients, and immediately report discovered tuberculosis patients to the health authorities for management and isolation.</p>
<p>(3) Public Quarantine: Strict disinfection should be carried out for deceased tuberculosis patients. Because tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease, few people pay attention to it. The patient's rooms, utensils, and excreta should be strictly disinfected. For example, for milk management, dairy cows must be tested for tuberculin regularly, and cows with mammary tuberculosis should not supply milk and should be killed and burned. Milk should be disinfected before drinking to prevent transmission.</p>
<p>(4) Patient Isolation: Isolating one person protects everyone. All people with tuberculosis should be isolated for a long period of time and hospitalized for treatment, and should no longer be in contact with healthy people. If recuperating at home, they should sleep and eat alone. The patient's bowls, chopsticks, cups, and basins should be boiled and disinfected and used separately from others. Furthermore, the sputum and pus of tuberculosis patients should be burned with fire to kill the pathogens, and clothes and bedding should also be disinfected to eliminate the chance of infection.</p>
<p>(5) Handling Contacts: When a tuberculosis patient is discovered at home, in addition to sending the patient to the hospital for treatment or handling it at home, a strict examination of the patient's family members is an essential procedure. It is also easier to implement this matter at this time. This method can discover patients early and obtain treatment opportunities early. It can also detect the source of infection, eradicate it, and reduce the threat of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(6) Family Care and Assistance: The general public lacks health knowledge, and the poor economic environment leads to the widespread prevalence of tuberculosis. In addition to paying attention to the compulsory recuperation of patients, guidance and assistance should also be given to the patient's family to avoid widespread transmission. Furthermore, conduct physical examinations of family members to prove whether they have been infected to prevent the spread.</p>
<p>(7) Free Diagnosis and Treatment: Most people with tuberculosis have financial difficulties. Therefore, diagnosis, treatment, and recuperation expenses should be provided free of charge so that they have ample opportunity for treatment and care, and avoid going to crowded places again, increasing the risk and source of transmission.</p>
<p>(8) Improving the Environment: More attention should be paid to droplet transmission. Places such as ticket offices, banks, store transaction counters, and public telephones are all places where droplet transmission is easiest, so ways should be found to avoid them. For public eating places, hotels, bathrooms, barbershops, etc., public appliances should be disinfected. The second is to reduce population density. Urban construction in crowded cities should adopt the garden city construction method to reduce population density and eliminate the chance of transmission.</p>
<p>(9) Labor Health Care: This is only limited to workers in dusty occupations and workers with frequent contact opportunities. Regarding the defense against transmission, the daily working hours should be reduced for workers in occupations prone to tuberculosis infection. Work should also be divided into sections so that there is ample opportunity to rest to avoid overwork. The equipment for this type of work should be improved as much as possible. However, it is best to let them change careers after a considerable period of work. During the working period, an X-ray fluoroscopy should be performed every three months.</p>
<p>(10) Marriage Restrictions: People with active tuberculosis often have severe illness due to marriage, especially childbirth. Married women with active tuberculosis should be prevented from becoming pregnant, or abortion should be performed before four months. People with latent tuberculosis, if they have catarrhal symptoms, fever, and have the possibility of recurrence, should undergo induced abortion. Nursing mothers with newly developed tuberculosis should stop breastfeeding infants. Such things should be prohibited by the government to avoid transmission. People with active tuberculosis should not marry, and married people should not cohabit.</p>
<p>II. Improving Life:</p>
<p>(1) Peace of Mind: If you are truly unlucky and get tuberculosis, don't be afraid, and don't think that life is hopeless and be decadent and sad. Instead, you should rest fully, recuperate quietly and patiently, abandon all pessimism and disappointment, and have an attitude that this disease will get better one day. A cheerful mind is an essential element for recovery. People who are pessimistic are adding the toxins of panic to the toxins of tubercle bacilli to accelerate their own death.</p>
<p>(2) Quiet: Psychological effects have a great impact on the disease. You should try to control your emotions and be quiet and not irritable. Because quiet rest can save people's energy and reduce the number of breaths. (Normally, there are an average of about 35,000 breaths in 24 hours. If you lie flat on the bed, you can reduce 5,000 breaths every 24 hours.) It also reduces the pressure of blood circulation and reduces the number of beats. The rate of metabolism in the body is also reduced at the same time. Saving energy and reducing metabolism is to reduce the consumption and damage of body tissues. Indirectly, it can increase the body's weight. Reducing the number of breaths means reducing the expansion and contraction of the diseased lungs. These two points are the cornerstone of treating lung disease.</p>
<p>(3) Moderation: Bed rest is not suitable for labor. Going to the park and playing mahjong is not rest. Unless you have a doctor's guidance, don't exercise. Don't cough. Coughing is the worst deep breathing. When you feel like coughing up phlegm, quietly exhale to get the phlegm out. Phlegm can come out without coughing. This is something patients should learn. Don't smoke, don't drink alcohol, don't spit on the ground, don't kiss children, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Environment: Human health has an extremely close causal relationship with whether the environment in which they live meets hygienic conditions. Since we cannot exist independently of the environment, if we want to have a healthy life and reduce the threat of disease, we must change the living environment and remove all things that can harm our health so that it can meet hygienic conditions. Directly reduce the chance of contact with germs, and indirectly increase the body's resistance. Then you can be healthy. The following discusses the environmental improvement of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>III. Recuperation Equipment:</p>
<p>(1) Location Selection:</p>
<p>A. Sunlight: When tuberculosis patients are recuperating, they should live in elegant and clean rooms, with windows often open so that sunlight can directly shine in and the air circulates fully. Because sunlight contains ultraviolet rays. It has a special effect on skin tuberculosis and can increase the body's resistance and promote vigorous metabolism. It also has a considerable effect on tuberculosis in the body. Therefore, sunbathing is possible, but you must follow the doctor's instructions. Not all tuberculosis patients can sunbathe. Quartz lamp therapy is also a type, and the principle is the same. When sunbathing, you should take off your clothes and do not separate yourself with glass, because most of the ultraviolet rays are absorbed by the glass. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e175">Elm Tree Filamentous Fungus Disease <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhaoqi</p>
<p>Readers must find the term "elm tree filamentous fungus disease" mentioned in this article very unfamiliar, because not only do few medical books and magazines in East Asia publish it, but even European and American literature rarely mentions it. In fact, this disease is often seen in our clinical consultations, but because its symptoms are extremely easy to be confused with other symptoms, we have not paid attention to it. Last summer, when the author returned to Guangdong and consulted in the clinic, he encountered several cases and deeply felt that it had introductory value for the diagnosis of internal medicine clinical aspects, so he specially wrote it down, hoping that it would be approved by experts. However, the countryside is remote and few books are available for reference. Knowing that I have missed a lot, I am worried about making mistakes, and I hope that advanced people at home and abroad will not hesitate to teach me. As for the bacterial examination work mentioned in this article, I was assisted by Dr. Liang Junqing, and Qi dare not take credit for others, so I specially attached it here to show that I do not forget it.</p>
<p>According to the German name of elm tree filamentous fungus disease is Ulmenkrankheit, some people have written about it as early as 1800 AD. It is said that its symptoms are related to elm trees. Anyone who has been in contact with elm trees will suffer from a severe bronchitis. Unfortunately, there was no bacteriological examination at that time, so it was impossible to investigate the reasons in detail and verify them. Therefore, readers were half-believing and did not pay attention to it. After a long time, they forgot about it again. In recent years, several botanical experts have studied it and learned that elm trees do have a kind of bacteria that can infect people and cause disease. However, everyone's opinions are different, the names are different, and they have never mentioned the clinical symptoms in detail. There was a widespread epidemic of elm tree filamentous fungus disease in Louvain, Belgium in the past. Expert Schwarz conducted detailed research and learned that a kind of bacteria does grow on elm trees, and the general length is about 0.5-2.0mm, and sometimes it is 10-17mm long. If it is in a culture medium, it can grow to 80mm. This kind of bacteria is a filamentous fungus, often sparse and dense, gathered into bundles. At its end, there is a crown-like object to connect it. Sclrwarz named it Graphium ulmi (meaning elm tree filamentous fungus), and the western name Graphiomycoe in this article is taken from this. Later, Professor Ph. Biourge, G. Van. Cutsem and E. Brepo of Louvain University continued to study it and confirmed Schwarz's statement. And they had detailed introductions to the clinical symptoms. And Brec’o said that in patients with bronchitis, he found that the sputum contained elm tree filamentous fungus in 21 cases.</p>
<p>The occurrence of elm tree filamentous fungus disease is due to contact with elm trees, as mentioned above. In fact, people who have contact with apple trees or pear trees are also prone to this disease. In addition, if people who eat apples or pears are careless and send the filamentous fungus on the fruit peel into their mouths, they will also be infected with this disease. In addition, people who eat raw hawthorn or papaya are also prone to this disease. People in our country often like to pick up people's leftovers, thinking that eating apples or pears in this way can fully enjoy the vitamins in the fruit peel, but they do not know that the transmission of filamentous fungus occurs through this, which is regrettable. After this kind of filamentous fungus enters the mouth, it will occur after a short incubation period. At first, it is a common type of bronchitis, with itching in the throat, cough, and a small amount of transparent sticky sputum. Those who are infected are careless, thinking that they only have a common cold. However, because it does not heal for a long time, and the cough becomes more severe and has symptoms of asthma and spasm, at the same time, there is chest tightness, poor diet, and general movement and fever. Patients often think that they have tuberculosis. Even the consulting doctors think that they have tuberculosis, because if you auscultate their lungs, there are often bubbly noises, or their lung sounds are much lower than those of healthy people. However, if you examine it with X-rays, there is no trace of tuberculosis in their lungs. As for the sputum that is coughed up, it is mostly mucous and extremely viscous. If we pick it up with a matchstick, we can pick up the entire piece of sputum. And if we examine it with staining, we can find countless filamentous fungi in it.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned respiratory system symptoms, filamentous fungus can also invade various joints and cause chronic joint inflammation. In addition, filamentous fungus can also invade the skin and cause subcutaneous abscess. Finally, people who suffer from elm tree filamentous fungus disease often suffer from peripheral neuralgia and paralysis.</p>
<p>As for the treatment, the above-mentioned people all advocated the use of iodine preparations, saying that they were very effective. As for the amount used, it is one to three grams per day, and sometimes it can be increased to seven grams of iodine preparation in 24 hours. However, in my personal experience, Ammon joca is better, because it works quickly and has few side effects.</p>

<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>(1) Method to Prevent Cervical Cancer</p>
<p>According to the results of many years of research by B. Z. Cashman in the United States, it seems that the occurrence of cervical cancer is closely related to chronic inflammation of the cervix. The occurrence of cervical cancer is very slow, and it is often discovered unknowingly. It is too late to treat it when it is discovered. It is really a pity. However, according to the survey, it is known that all patients with cervical cancer have had chronic inflammation of the cervix for many years. Therefore, Cashman advocates that women over the age of 25 who have chronic inflammation of the cervix must be treated and cured as soon as possible. The occurrence of cervical cancer seems to be avoided as a result. However, Cashman also said that chronic inflammation of the cervix is ​​very difficult to cure. When necessary, the bottom layer electrocautery of the cervix must be used to remove the inflammatory lesions. (See the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, February 1945)</p>
<p>(2) Asthma and Other Allergies and Endocrine</p>
<p>According to C. Kousmine's report, endocrine disorders are closely related to the onset of asthma, eczema, rhinitis, joint rheumatism, and other allergic diseases. Kousmine has studied patients with the above diseases and found that a large amount of Gonadotropes Horman was excreted in their urine during the onset of their diseases. Therefore, Kousmine infers that if future endocrine research can be thoroughly understood, the above diseases can be easily solved. (See the Swiss Medical Weekly, Issue 8, February 1947)</p>
<p>(3) Using Ultrasound to Treat Various Diseases</p>
<p>According to the report of Czech doctor J. Zeman, the vibration frequency of ultrasound can be used to detect the location of brain tumors, and it can also be used to examine various changes in various internal organs in the abdomen, and it can also treat various rheumatic diseases. However, acute neuralgia and joint inflammation should not be used. (See the Czech Medical Report, June 1947).</p>
<p>(4) Infantile Paralysis is Rampant in the United States</p>
<p>We have discovered several cases of infantile paralysis in Shanghai (in fact, how many there are, because of the lack of survey statistics, so it is impossible to know) and have been very surprised. However, according to the Vienna Medical Weekly, there were a total of 2,600 people in the United States who suffered from this disease in 1946, of which 200 needed an iron lung to maintain their breathing work. It can be seen that this disease is rampant. The health situation in our country is of course worse than that in the United States. The gradual increase of this disease is even more expected. I sincerely hope that the health administration authorities in our country will quickly find ways to prevent it.</p>
<p>(5) New Drug to Treat Melancholy</p>
<p>Ugo Cerletti, a professor of neurology at the University of Rome in Italy, has invented a new drug specifically for treating various melancholy called Akroagonin. It is said that this is an extract from the brain of a certain animal and is very effective in treating the above diseases. (Note: The inventor is the first person to create the use of electric shock therapy to treat neurological diseases and is an authority in the field of neurology.)</p>
<p>(6) Productivity and Morbidity Rates in the United States</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the US Health Survey, in 1946, one person was sent to the hospital for treatment every two seconds. In this year, a total of (151,153,452 people in the United States were hospitalized due to illness, while in 1945, there were 16,257,402 people. One baby is born in the hospital every fifteen seconds. (There were a total of 2,136,373 newborns in 1946, while there were only 1,969,667 in 1945.) In 1946, there were 99,741 people suffering from tuberculosis (there were only 82,186 in 1945), which is more than the previous year.</p>

<h3 id="e177">After the Vendors at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Stalls Were Banned, the Transportation Department Replied to the Reason for Taking Back the Self-Run Business <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The stalls at Gu Station on this road were operated by issuing licenses before the war. After the victory, the original method was restored. Since the implementation, the effectiveness has been remarkable, so we planned to take back the self-run business in order to improve it. The reasons for taking back the self-run business are as follows: (1) Beijing and Shanghai are the political and economic centers. This road connects the two places and is of great importance. At this time, the bandit disaster is spreading. In order to maintain traffic safety, it is necessary to prevent traitors from mixing in and destroying things. The roadside stalls outside the road are of mixed quality and difficult to control.</p>
<p>(2) The licensed vendors outside the road sell unclean food and raise prices, turning service into exploitation, which is obviously harmful to the health and safety of passengers.</p>
<p>(3) This road is running catering services for the welfare of passengers, striving for comfort, economy and benefits, reducing the common psychology of the Chinese people who regard travel as a daunting task, and changing the impression of the railway by people in the society. Therefore, the scope of supply is expanding day by day, striving to meet the needs of passengers of all levels. For example, we have recently added the supply of snacks, tea and water for third and fourth class cars, and are planning to run soy milk and noodles, etc., with low prices and not for profit. In addition, the setting of dining rooms in various stations is based on the principle of simplicity and elegance, and the environment is beautified, so that passengers can get a moment of rest in their hard work and dust, which is not without assistance to their body and mind.</p>
<p>(4) Beijing and Shanghai are the gateways of our country, and friendly countries come and go frequently. From an international point of view, catering services are a very small business, but they affect the whole body and have a relationship of interests. Based on the above reasons, in order to ensure that every passenger can get benefits and every platform can reach the standard of solemnity, this road has to strive to reform the supply of food and beverage services, so the recovery of self-run stalls at major stations seems to be imminent.</p>
<p>However, it has been found that some of the stalls at each station are vendors who have returned to their jobs. Because they have been in business for a long time, it is difficult to change their jobs. In order to maintain their livelihoods, we are now finding out and appropriately assigning them to other small stations for business, or assigning them other jobs for relief. Thank you for your inquiry, and we hereby reply. To the Social Service Department of Shen Bao, Transportation Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration</p>

<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Will a nation, like a fruit tree, grow from a young bud, flourish, bear fruit, and eventually rot? This question may be considered too naive, but I have some doubts, or rather, some anxieties.</p>
<p>Of course, I know that to answer this question, we must first clearly distinguish between life and meaning. Because there is individual life and there is the life of a race. Individual life, so far, cannot escape the iron law of evolution of metabolism, although modern science has made rapid progress, its ability is only to extend life, and it cannot create life or infinitely extend individual life. Even the latest artificial insemination methods only artificially inseminate the embryo of life, and do not truly create life.</p>
<p>As for the life of a race, it is certainly different. The life of a race can be infinitely extended, and not only can it be extended, but it can also undergo qualitative changes at a certain stage of its development and develop into another new life. The combination of sperm and egg into the lives of thousands of animals and plants is the result of infinite qualitative changes in life.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk too much about biology here. What I want to say is that although the life of a race has the properties of infinite continuation and development, it is not without conditions, and one of the main conditions is the ability to constantly maintain new blood. Especially for a nation that constitutes the life of a country, it is even more necessary to constantly circulate new blood, otherwise it will inevitably grow and rot, rot and decay, and decline.</p>
<p>But what can be used to measure the prosperity and decline of a nation? It is culture—the living culture of the nation. Therefore, it is particularly important to emphasize living culture, and there is a reason for this, because the culture of a nation has various aspects. For example, the historical culture of a country and a nation does not necessarily represent its real life culture. In terms of historical culture, China is of course a remarkable country, but just as the national life culture of today's Italy or Greece does not necessarily represent the culture of ancient Rome and Greece, today's national life culture of ours has also gone far from the cultural achievements of our ancestors.</p>
<p>Some people have called the Chinese a conservative nation. In fact, it would be alright if we could truly live up to the name of conservative. It's like the descendants of a wealthy family, if they can preserve their property to the end, they can still be considered worthy of their ancestors. But we can't even talk about being conservative now. It is important to know that conservatism requires the strength to be conservative. Because preservation does not mean stopping. In the world, there is only progress or regress. Being able to hold on under unfavorable conditions is not conservatism, but progress; not progressing under unfavorable or favorable conditions is not preservation, but regression.</p>
<p>If we say that Western England and Eastern Japan are both conservative nations, then the conservatism of the English is progressive conservatism, while we are regressing, and we cannot talk about conservatism. This is not saying to promote the ambitions of others and diminish our own prestige. If you just compare the differences in social customs between China and England, you can see whose national life culture is vibrant and full of upward spirit.</p>
<p>Speaking the truth may be satisfying for a while, but it is ultimately useless. Our national life culture has obviously approached decline from maturity, and the low mood and pessimistic atmosphere of the people are signals of this phenomenon. Those who are experienced in the ways of the world tend to see everything too thoroughly, while the younger generation sees everything too shortsightedly. Because they see too thoroughly, they feel that nothing matters; because they see too shortsightedly, they feel that there is no way. The psychological destination of both is despair and grief, which is manifested in the living culture as corruption and decadence.</p>
<p>However, although the modern life culture of the Chinese nation has tended toward the stage of maturity and decline, it is not without any way to save it. However, this method is not to restore the morals and minds of the world as some people advocate, but to create new ways of life to reform the dying social atmosphere, that is, to infuse new blood into our declining national life culture.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Old Scenes of Shanghai <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yansheng</p>
<p>The land of gold and powder in Jiangnan, the home of silk fans in a foreign settlement. When previous people praised the scenery of Shanghai, they always thought that Shanghai was the first to open up to the modern trend, with singing and dancing everywhere, regarding it as heaven on earth. I have been a guest in Shanghai several times, paying much attention to the remaining charm of the past. Today, decades later, when I reread what people recorded, it feels like being in a different place. Master Fuxuan's poem says: "The cultural relics of Langhuan are left for continuation, waiting to take the traces in dreams in future years." Revisiting the past and present, visiting and seeking winding paths, embracing and touching the wind, this is also something precious in the local customs.</p>
<p>Wang Tanqiu, an old man from Tiannan, mentioned eight old scenic spots in Shanghai in his journal, and many famous people of the time wrote poems about them. The eight scenic spots are "Haida Rising Sun," "Huangpu Autumn Tide," "Longhua Evening Bell," "Wusong Misty Rain," "Shishan Night Moon," "Yebo Rowing Song," "Fenghua Distant View," and "Jianggao Snow Clearing," etc. Although there is no detailed annotation for these eight scenic spots, judging from the meaning of the words, they seem to be mostly inclined to wild waters, layered clouds, and vast waves, without expressing a single word about the prosperous scene of the foreign settlement.</p>
<p>In addition to these eight scenic spots in Shanghai, some enthusiasts proposed ten scenic spots in northern Shanghai, starting with the prosperity of the city center, and from the scenery, one can also know the social situation of Shanghai in the past. The ten scenic spots are "Guiren Watching Opera," "Xinlou Selecting Delicacies," "Yun Pavilion Tasting Smoke," "Zuile Drinking Wine," "Songfeng Tasting Tea," "Guixin Visiting Beauty," "Lou Ting Listening to Books," "Fei Che Embracing Beauty," "Night Market Lighting Lamps," and "Pubin Strolling in the Moonlight." The first two words of each of these ten scenic spots are mostly the names of famous venues in the past. Guiren is the Dan Gui Tea Garden, Xinlou is the Da Xin Restaurant, Yun Pavilion is the Qingyun Pavilion, and Guixin is the former Beili, and the rest can be deduced similarly. Looking at the descriptions of these ten scenic spots, most of them no longer exist today, and as time has passed and circumstances have changed, they are not enough to be a place that the society praises. For example, Yun Pavilion Tasting Smoke is used to describe opium, which is now strictly prohibited. As for flying cars embracing beauty, we can see the scene of that time in "Nine-tailed Turtle" written by Haishang Shushi Sheng, and "Biographies of Flowers in Shanghai" written in Shanghai dialect.</p>
<p>In addition to these eight scenic spots and ten scenic spots, Yingruan Magazine Jia further recorded as many as sixty or seventy bamboo branch lyrics about Shanghai by Yinjiang lyricists and Guyue Shanfang. The sentence of Yinjiang lyricists contains "The sea ban is opened for ten thousand miles of trade, and the thousand-year-old tombs are transformed into pavilions. It is pitiful that in the land of wine and flowers, there are Qinglai at night who annotate herbs," lamenting the present and mourning the past, with far-reaching intentions. Also, such as: "Another scene is a fairyland, and the fragrance of good flowers reaches the front of the dance building. The singing and dancing at night say it is the Neon Clothes Song, envying the banished immortals in the Moon Palace," and such as: "Lingbo steps lightly over the rainbow bridge, and the reflection in the spring pool is also charming. Afraid that the coming boat will hit the charming shadow, the people in the covered boat have already stopped rowing." These are all descriptions of the prosperous scene of Shanghai, which is spent in singing and dancing. Among the bamboo branch lyrics about the seasonal customs of Shanghai, such as: "Lantern balls and fiery trees make a noisy Lantern Festival, and the men and women are as noisy as a surging tide. The night is quiet and the people are sparse, and the slanting moon is cold. Whose pavilion is playing the xiao?" Now it is in the old year, and thinking of the excitement of the Lantern Festival back then, it can be seen that the peace is decorated differently from today. Also, such as: "Make an appointment to burn incense at the Yimiao Temple, and secretly draw the third spiritual sign. Secretly confide the secret thoughts, not afraid of God knowing, but afraid of sister knowing." In the description of customs, the voices of children are skillfully written to the tip of the hair.</p>
<p>In the bamboo branch lyrics of Guyue Shanfang, in addition to describing indulgence in wine and women, he can uniquely see things from a side perspective, and his words say: "A mirror polishes the vast sky for thousands of miles, and the building is combined with the reflection into the river. This country also has a cool environment, who is scratching his head and singing loudly?" Little do they know that decades later, the prosperity of Yangchang Shili is even better than before!</p>
<h3 id="e180">Talking about Gift-Giving <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Yifeng</p>
<p>Here, let me first record a section of telegram:</p>
<p>"On New Year's Eve, a section chief of the Tianliang Office of a certain county in Yang'e brought New Year's gifts to the province and sent them to Wu Liangchen, the director of the Provincial Tianliang Office. Wu discovered that there was a gold bar and a pair of bracelets in the gifts. He then presented the original items to Chairman Wan, who was very angry and immediately detained the section chief."</p>
<p>In today's prevailing trend of gift-giving, I think this news is not fabricated. Originally, we are a country with complicated etiquette and attention to face, and the matter of gift-giving can be said to have a long history. Human relations are originally not to be overly criticized. However, the act of gift-giving is often used as a means once it enters the political arena.</p>
<p>Taking the above news as an example, Wu Liangchen's failure to be moved by the sight of gold bars is still a good official; the clean are self-cleaning, and the turbid are self-turbid, which can also be clearly proven here. If it is the "section chief," it is not worth asking about. A mere section chief can actually use gold bars and gold bracelets to give to his superiors, which is quite impressive; if we compare his deserved salary with this, we can easily understand what kind of official this is—in addition, subordinates can directly give gifts to their superiors, and the discipline of this officialdom can be imagined.</p>
<p>I remember before the Mid-Autumn Festival of the old lunar calendar last year, the so-called "No Gift-Giving Movement" was launched in the Beijing-Shanghai area, which was in full swing for a while. Naturally, it was aimed at this abnormal morbid state, but unfortunately, "the music was too high and few could harmonize," and it was not very effective. Therefore, at the end of the old lunar year, the packaged gifts in food stores were piled up like mountains, and the prices were often tens of millions, which were by no means affordable for a poor civil servant who was law-abiding and clean-living. Valuable items such as gold bars and gold bracelets are naturally even more unnecessary to talk about.</p>
<p>From another perspective, the gift-giving movement, after prevailing in the officialdom, is also an expansion of the act of private transfer of interests and bribery, which really opens the door for a bunch of shameless people to exploit. If this trend does not go away for a day, it will become extremely difficult to clarify the administration of officials. This kind of deal is certainly unwilling to do by people with a little shame and integrity, and therefore "good people" are even more difficult to stand in the officialdom, and establishing a "government of good people" and advocating "politics of good people" will also become empty talk. Therefore, this "gift-giving" trend is really a malignant tumor in the officialdom!</p>
<p>We really hope that the current heads of institutions can follow the example of Wu Liangchen!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Things That Money Can't Buy <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>"Money can make the devil push the millstone," that's right, sometimes money is omnipotent; however, there is at least one thing in the world that money still cannot buy—that is emotion. When the nephew of the Mischief King Napoleon, French Emperor Louis Napoleon tried to buy a watch inlaid with a town stone for his wife Empress Eugénie, the tyrant who fantasized about ruling Europe learned the lesson that money is not omnipotent.</p>
<p>In 1852, an American, Charles Goodyear, participated in the Paris Exhibition with many rubber products. Because rubber was not yet noticed by the world at that time, his original intention was to show the importance and versatility of rubber. The things he displayed included rubber bracelets, rubber necklaces, rubber rings, etc., but the most exquisite thing was a diamond-studded watch. The whole city of Paris yearned for this watch, especially Empress Eugénie. She must get it, and she thought the focus of the problem was only the price.</p>
<p>But this watch was not for sale. Goodyear made this watch specifically for his wife, but she unfortunately passed away in England before the opening of the exhibition. Therefore, this watch has its great emotional value, which cannot be bought by Eugénie's power and the treasury of the French royal family.</p>
<p>In despair, Louis Napoleon did not hesitate to visit Goodyear in the civilian area of Paris.</p>
<p>"Mr. Goodyear, unless the Empress has that watch, our family will not be at peace," he pleaded.</p>
<p>Goodyear sympathized with the French Emperor's predicament. Finally, he came up with a win-win method—to make a copy. With the help of the royal diamond workers, he completed the work and presented the second rubber watch to the greedy Eugénie. While she was alive, Goodyear never displayed the original watch again, and she believed until her death that she owned the only diamond-studded rubber watch in the world—she thought money was indeed omnipotent.</p>
<p>And the American who started with rubber not only made an empress happy, but also made his own conscience at ease, and also made his wallet full.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Federal Court recently concluded an unprecedented case of cooperation in distress. Two price administration auditors, Zuo Le and Terroir, were accused to the court of accepting bribes while exercising their duties.</p>
<p>The judge ordered the two to pay a fine of twenty yuan and a sentence of nine months. The defense lawyer stood up and said, "Because the family circumstances of each defendant in this case are special, I request the court to show benevolence outside the law and reduce the sentence appropriately."</p>
<p>The special circumstances referred to by the lawyer are: Zuo Le is the father of two children, and Terroir has four children. If the two are imprisoned at the same time, the family will suffer excessive hardship, which is self-evident. Therefore, the lawyer's suggestion is to request the judge to allow the two defendants not to be imprisoned at the same time, so that one party can make a living to help the poverty of the other party. "The two defendants have already agreed that when one person is in jail, the other person is willing to bear the family life." The result was as desired, and Zuo Le and Terroir could be sentenced in installments. The court further shortened the sentence to six months.</p>
<p>Terroir was designated to be imprisoned first, and Zuo Le was released on bail with 1,500 yuan in cash. The two colleagues have been working together for seven years. Because they shared the pleasure of accepting bribes and suffered disaster, they really became friends who can share adversity but not prosperity!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Cold Temple Poetry Stone Mountain Zhang Engraving <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yifen</p>
<p>Zhang Yisun's poem "Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night," has been recited for thousands of years, and it is especially popular in Japan. During the war, the Japanese soldiers in Jiangnan all sang and chanted this poem. In Suzhou antique shops, all rubbings of this poem were searched and bought, even to the point of taking photocopies to respond. Yu Quyuan's newly revised "Records of Hanshan Temple": "There are no less than hundreds and thousands of temples in Wuzhong, and Hanshan Temple is named after Yisun's poem, and its name is not only well-known in China, but also recited in Japan. I have lived in Wu for a long time, and all Japanese literati have come to visit me. When they see me, they often mention Hanshan Temple, and they say that even three-foot children in their country can recite this poem." It can be seen that it has been deeply rooted in people's hearts for a long time. The first stone carving of this poem in the temple was written by Xun Gong (named Gui, courtesy name Yuyu), which is what Cheng Gong Pi's poem calls "Zhang Ji's inscription written by Neihan." It has been lost for a long time. The second stone was written by Wen Zhengming of the Ming Dynasty, without the year and month, four lines, each line has a different number of characters, large cursive script, and less than ten characters remain. The third stone was written by Yu Dianyuan, and the record says: "The west house is slightly repaired, and all the old steles in the temple are planted here. The Zhang Yisun poem written by Wen Daizhao is now incomplete, and I am asked to rewrite and re-engrave it." The poem is three lines, ten characters per line, the postscript is three lines, eighteen characters per line, cursive script, with Yin side, and the postscript says: "Hanshan Temple used to have a Tang Zhang Ji Maple Bridge Night Mooring poem written by Wen Daizhao. Over the years, it has been blurred. In the Guangxu Bingwu year, Zhongcheng Xiaoshi newly built several houses in the temple and asked me to rewrite and engrave the stone. Yu Yue." The back of the stele has eight lines, twenty characters per line, regular script, with the title: "Tang Zhang Ji's Maple Bridge Night Mooring is well-known, but the second sentence, 'Jiangfeng Yuhuo,' is quite doubtful. Song Gong Mingzhi's "Zhongwu Records" is "Jiangcun Yuhuo," which is valuable in the old books of the Song Dynasty. This poem was once written by Xun Gong of the Song Dynasty to engrave on stone, but it cannot be seen today. The inscription written by Wen Daizhao of the Ming Dynasty is also blurred, and the word 'Xia' in 'Jiangxia' cannot be distinguished. Zhongcheng Xiaoshi asked me to rewrite it, so I followed the current version, but the ancient version of Jiangcun cannot be ignored, so I wrote a poem and attached it to tell the viewers. Xun Gong's old ink has long been lost, and Daizhao's remaining stele cannot be touched. Fortunately, there is the "Zhongwu Records," and a thousand gold for a word is Jiangcun. Yu Yue." One side of the stele has five lines, thirty-two characters per line, regular script, with the title: "Zhang Yisun's poem has many differences in the world. In the title, Fengqiao was mistakenly written as Fengqiao in the old days. The "Wu County Continued Records" has corrected it according to the inscription written by Xun Gong. The poem 'Yuhuo' is sometimes mistakenly written as 'Yufu.' The "Complete Tang Poems" compiled by Yongzheng is based on this version, but the note says: 'Or make fire,' so it is not determined to be the fixed version of 'father.' The "Zhongwu Records" records this poem as 'Jiangcun Yuhuo,' which is an old custom of the Song Dynasty and can be relied upon. Tai Shi Qu wrote a poem to prove it. From now on, this poem is determined. In the Guangxu two years, I moved to Fusan Wu, and occasionally passed by this temple, lamenting its desolation, and repaired it a little, so I engraved Zhang's poem and Qu's poem, and asked those who read this poem in the world. Chen, Guiyang." Reading this, we know the year of the stone carving, and the similarities and differences between Jiangcun Yuhuo and Fengqiao. It is said that this stone was moved by the Japanese during the war, but now we know that it is not true. It is still in the temple. Mr. Hu Fan used the name of Zhang Puquan's committee with the same name as Yisun and asked him to rewrite it. It turned out to be his last work. Mr. had recorded the incident in this journal. Hu Fan has personally outlined it and sent it to famous craftsmen to engrave it on stone. It can be completed around the Yuan Dynasty. It will be sent to the temple, which is the fourth stone carving of Zhang's poem. Zhang's original sequel will be presented to the National History Museum as a permanent memorial. This is not only a beautiful literary relationship, but also a beautiful story of lakes and mountains.</p>
<p>Many poets in the past dynasties have praised Hanshan Temple and Maple Bridge. Here are three selections to see a glimpse. Wei Yingwu's "Visiting Hanshan Temple" (Visiting is also written as Staying): "The heart is cut off from coming and going, and the traces live in the world. Alone the autumn grass path, staying overnight in Hanshan Temple. Today, the county office is idle, and I think about asking about the words of the Lengyan Sutra." (Jun Suzhou Collection) Lu You's "Staying at Maple Bridge": "I haven't been to Maple Bridge Temple for seven years, and the guest pillow is still the midnight bell. The wind and the moon don't need to be lightly lamented, and there are still thousands of heavy Bashan from here." (Lu Jiannan Collection) Fan Chengda's "Maple Bridge": "Zhumen Baibi pillow the bay, peach and plum are silent, full of the house. There are floating areas on the wall and on the side of the road, sending people to the north and south to manage the sorrow of separation." (Fan Shihai Poetry Collection)</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Squandering of Time <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>Among the several "strengths" that Chinese people deserve to be proud of, in addition to being able to cook a good dish and embroider a good pattern, being good at squandering time seems to be worth writing about in the history of the world's nations. The author once went to a postal stamp agency (not a post office) to buy stamps. I waited outside the counter for about half an hour before reaching the window, and the staff member was carefully writing an envelope. It is not an exaggeration to say that it took him fifteen minutes to write fifteen walnut-sized characters. I had already looked at my watch three times outside the counter and was getting impatient.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that the Chinese know how to cherish everything, such as cherishing printed paper, cherishing clothes, cherishing rice grains, etc., but they rarely see people regard time as "treasure" even though there is a saying "an inch of time is worth an inch of gold"? Whenever they have free time (actually, it may be time freed up after backloging official business), everyone spends it chatting while reading newspapers.</p>
<p>Also, some people are very frugal with themselves. I believe that there must be someone who walked from Jing'an Temple to the New World, or from Shanzhong Road to Baxianqiao because they couldn't get on the tram or bus. Of course, he saved a sum of fare, but he spent a lot of time to save money. If he could use this time to exercise, draft new plans, work in the laboratory, read useful books and newspapers, etc., how could it accelerate his personal and career success. What's more, time is something that is lost and cannot be regained!</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no shortage of people in society who advocate "walking instead of riding." I think they are too generous with spending time. As far as the author knows, the relatives and friends who have a little status in society have precise calculations for everything, but they don't care about small things like car fares. This is definitely not their plan, but they also deeply understand the purpose of "fully benefiting from time."</p>
<p>It may be hard to believe, but there are other times when we spend money to squander time. I finally queued up to buy a theater ticket, or bought it at a high price on the black market, and then found that it was a play that was not worth watching, and I had this feeling. I think anyone who loses money in any gambling has the same feeling.</p>
<p>In fact, the preciousness of time is often related to the success or failure of personal career or the rise and fall of the country. In the event of an important juncture, it is inevitable that the difference is "minutes and seconds," and the loss is "eternal." Recently, I read an article written by an American specifically for employees in the financial industry, which said that a salesman planned to win over a wealthy man to open a current account in the bank, hesitated for a while, delayed for a day, and then went to visit him. Who knows, this wealthy man suddenly died of an acute illness. Although this article is aimed at bank employees, it can also serve as a warning to general readers. In personal struggle, as long as you take a slight step forward, perhaps the fruit of success will be taken first by him. How can you not be afraid!</p>

<p>Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (75)</p>
<p>Zhu Xi said, "You should rest!" Old Woman Wang smiled and shook her head. Zhu Qi still held Old Woman Wang's hand and said, "The boss really has good eyesight, he can find a good person like you to help, it's really rare." Old Woman Wang's hand was still casually held by Zhu Qi, just pursing her lips and smiling, "I said the boss has good eyesight, he can recognize a good person like Mr. Xu, you are really affectionate. Today the boss just didn't come back occasionally, and you are so anxious. What will you do if something unexpected happens to the boss?" Zhu Qi was so anxious when she heard this that she pressed Old Woman Wang's hand heavily and said, "Why do you say that? Do you think something will happen to the boss?" Old Woman Wang hurriedly said, "No, no, I'm just saying that." Zhu Xiao was already in tears, and said, "If something bad happens to the boss, my life will be over!" When she said this, her voice choked and she couldn't continue. Old Woman Wang took out her own handkerchief, wiped Zhu Xi's tears, and comforted her with a smile, "I'm just saying that, you two will always grow old together." Zhu Xi said, "I don't know why today, I just feel heartache, as if something bad is going to happen. Logically, I don't have to be so anxious if the boss doesn't come back, but I feel so uncomfortable. What time is it now? It's not dawn yet!" Old Woman Wang said, "It's almost dawn, please rest for a while." Saying that, she slowly pulled out her hand that was holding Zhu Xiao, put Zhu Xi's hand into the quilt again, tucked the quilt in, lowered her head slightly and said, "Sleep well, don't think wildly, I'll give you a massage again." Zhu Qi was so moved by Old Woman Wang's actions, she said, "You are so good!" Old Woman Wang pursed her small mouth and said, "What's so good about me? I'm not even as good as a hair of the boss!" Zhu Zhai saw that her words contained sourness, she couldn't help but stretch out her hand in the quilt, tightly holding Old Woman Wang's hand and said, "How are you not as good as the boss? I think you are the same as the boss."</p>
<h3 id="e187">On Making the Best Use of Talent <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>There is an old saying: "With singleness of purpose and unwavering determination, metal and stone can be cleft." This is to teach people to strive forward in their endeavors. I remember a story from an ancient book, I believe it was about Li Bai. In his youth, he was idle and did not strive for improvement. An old woman, knowing he was a great talent, felt sorry for him because he did not cherish himself. To awaken him, she would grind an iron pestle on a stone in front of her door every day. Li Bai, seeing the old woman grinding the iron pestle daily, was puzzled and asked her what she was doing. The old woman replied that she was grinding the iron pestle into a needle. Li Bai was greatly moved upon hearing this and changed his ways, striving for improvement, eventually becoming famous throughout the world, his name living on forever.</p>
<p>The "Liezi: Quelling the Thirst" chapter recounts the story of Yu Gong removing the mountains: "The Taihang and Wangwu mountains, seven hundred li in breadth and ten thousand ren in height, were originally located south of Jizhou and north of Heyang. Yu Gong of Beishan, nearly ninety years old, lived facing the mountains. Annoyed by the cold north of the mountains and the inconvenience it caused, he gathered everyone together and planned, saying, 'Let us, with all our strength, flatten the hazards, and open a path to the south of Yu, reaching the north bank of the Han River, shall we?' Everyone agreed. His wife doubted, saying, 'With your strength, you cannot even diminish the height of Kuifu Mountain. What can you do with Taihang and Wangwu? Where will you put the soil and stones?' They replied, 'We will throw them into the end of the Bohai Sea, north of the Yin Earth.' So he led three grandsons who could carry loads, chipping at the rocks and cultivating the soil, transporting it to the end of the Bohai Sea in baskets. A widow from the neighboring Jingcheng family had a young son, just teething, who hopped over to help. A year passed. The wise old man of the Hequ River laughed and stopped him, saying, 'How foolish you are! With your remaining years and strength, you cannot even destroy a hair of the mountains. What can you do with the soil and stones?' Yu Gong of Beishan sighed deeply, saying, 'Your heart is so obstinate that it cannot be penetrated, not even as much as a weak woman and child. Though I may die, I will have sons. Sons will beget grandsons, and grandsons will beget sons. Sons will have sons, and sons will have grandsons. Generations upon generations will continue without end. And the mountains will not increase in size. Why worry that they cannot be flattened?' The wise old man of the Hequ River had nothing to say in response. The spirit who controls the snakes heard of this and, fearing that he would not stop, reported it to the Emperor. The Emperor was moved by his sincerity and ordered the two sons of Kua'e to carry the two mountains away, one to the east of Shuo and the other to the south of Yong. From then on, there were no more ridges or barriers south of Ji and north of the Han."</p>
<p>Such inspirational words, teaching people to strive, are initially unobjectionable. Mencius quoted Shun, saying, "What kind of man was Shun? What kind of man am I? Whoever makes an effort can become like him." This is to say that as long as one does his best, everyone can become a sage, also encouraging people to strive for improvement. However, such words are quite misleading, leading people to believe that as long as one has perseverance, there is nothing in the world that cannot be accomplished, without needing to consider one's own abilities. In my opinion, it is certainly not right to do things without perseverance, but it is also inappropriate to rely solely on perseverance without considering one's own abilities, as it is unlikely to achieve the best results. It seems that effort should be directed toward appropriate directions. "Heaven endows me with talent, which must be useful." We should have religious-like faith in this saying, but we should not expand its meaning to mean that I can do anything in the world.</p>
<p>Taking the story of Yu Gong of Beishan as an example, for a declining old man of ninety to want to move mountains seven hundred li in breadth and ten thousand ren in height, his ambition is certainly commendable, but without the "Emperor being moved by his sincerity," it would truly be a great tragedy. Yu Gong resolved to use the manpower and time of tens or hundreds of generations of descendants to remove the ten-thousand-ren mountains. Although we cannot definitively say that it would certainly not succeed, it would be regrettable to devote the energy and time of tens or hundreds of generations of descendants to the task of moving mountains, preventing them from doing other appropriate work. Furthermore, regarding the story of the old woman grinding a pestle: If we were to rely on her method to make all the needles we need, firstly, it would be a terrible waste of steel, and secondly, it would be too time-consuming, making it uneconomical. As for Li Bai, he was greatly moved upon seeing this and resolved to strive for improvement, but it still had nothing to do with the actual national economy and democracy. If Li Bai had a talent for mechanical invention, upon seeing the old woman's laborious and futile work, he should have improved the method of needle-making and then invented a sewing machine, which would be more beneficial to the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>However, those are just digressions. In short, we must recognize that "humans are not omnipotent" and should assess our own talents to do appropriate work, which would benefit both ourselves and others. However, although Mencius said things like "Shun was a man, I am also a man," he also said, "Some labor with their minds, and some labor with their strength. Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by others provide food for others; those who govern others are provided with food by others." This shows that he did not truly want everyone to become a governing Shun; otherwise, if everyone were to become a laboring-with-the-mind Shun, the fact that there would no longer be a need for "governing" would be secondary. The most difficult point would be: without the laboring-with-strength providers of food, what would everyone eat? That would truly be "serving the public on an empty stomach." Mencius's words about "laboring with the mind and laboring with strength, governing others and being governed by others" are very likely to be misunderstood and cause resentment. In fact, Mencius's so-called "governing" is not the "six old officials ascending to the hall" type of governing, or the "prohibiting this and banning that, let everyone know" type of governing, nor is it the type of governing where generals like Qi Zaiyu or officials like Xu Jizhuang hoard every penny of public funds, but rather it refers to organizing national affairs in an orderly manner, which is "eliminating harm for the world and creating benefits." This kind of "governing others" work, when done seriously, cannot really be said to be "carefree." On the contrary, as long as the work of "governing others" is done well, those who labor with their strength, even if they labor year-round to provide food for those who labor with their minds, will be sincerely convinced and will not necessarily feel how hard they are working. Mencius's words about laboring with the mind and laboring with strength, in short, simply mean "division of labor and cooperation," which is logically sound. The problem with people today is that too many people do not ask themselves about their own talents and simply think, "Whoever makes an effort can become like him." Such effort, taken to the extreme, can lead to everyone having nothing to eat.</p>
<p>"Effort" is good, but as mentioned earlier, it is always necessary to choose an appropriate direction. Otherwise, it would be a waste of energy, and such a waste of energy is a suffering for oneself and a loss for society. It must be understood that "using an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken" is as inappropriate as "using paper scissors to kill an ox." For example, with timber: cedar has its uses, pine has its uses, lauan has its uses, and teak has its uses. Not using a certain type of wood where it should be used, or using a certain type of wood where it should not be used, results in a waste of timber on the one hand and an unsuitable product on the other. Zhuangzi's commentary by Guo Xiang says, "Those with small capacities do not require great resources, while those with great capacities cannot be used in small ways. Therefore, there is an ultimate division in principle, and things have complete extremes. Each is sufficient to fulfill its purpose, and together they achieve unity." It also says, "Things each have their suitability. If they find their suitability, where can they not be at ease?" It also says, "Although sizes may differ, when placed in the realm of self-attainment, things fulfill their nature, matters match their abilities, each fulfills its role, and ease is unified. How can winning or losing be considered in this?" It also says, "To seek externally what cannot be sought externally is like using a compass to draw a square, or a fish longing to be a bird!"</p>
<p>"Things fulfilling their nature, matters matching their abilities, each fulfilling its role" should be our ideal. Looking around, today's reality is too far from this standard. Lauan is being used as pine, pine is being used as teak, fish are longing to be birds, and compasses are being used to draw squares. Today's allocation of talent is like "randomly pairing mandarin ducks," and this waste of talent is truly regrettable. For this situation of "randomly pairing mandarin ducks," we urgently need to make a serious correction and give it an appropriate "adjustment." Our slogan is:</p>
<p>People match their positions,</p>
<p>Talent fulfills its purpose.</p>
