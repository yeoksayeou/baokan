<h3>蘇聯對日和約態度仍主開外長特別會　莫洛托夫答覆我國建議　中共代表赴伯力參加蘇軍方會議</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科四日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫上月卅日致我王外長之照會中稱：「僅外長會議有權準備對日和約」。莫氏建議遠東委會之其他會員國可參加外長會議，依照對德和約工作之先例，而可能設立之各委員會及小組委會之工作，以及關於情報蹉商之會議。上述照會乃答覆王部長上月五日之照會。按我國照會中，指出應由遠東委會担任對日和約之主要工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦四日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣擴稱：蘇聯已分別照會中，美，英三國，重新建議在本月召開四國外長特別會議，以起草對日和約，一九四五年波茨坦會議明白規定，中，美，英，蘇四國外長會議有權擬訂對日和約，蘇聯政府鑒於中國對波茨坦協定之意見，認爲有補充聲明必要。蓋依照波茨坦協定，擬訂和約之外長會議，當由曾與有關敵國簽訂授降條約之各會員國派遺代表組織之。據此，中國雖未參加對歐洲方面前敵國擬訂和約，此次則應在被邀之列，但中國政府主張逮東委員會職權對於日本和會有直接關係，此種見解就一九四五年十二月莫斯科協定而言，不能認爲理由充分。根據莫斯科協定對日和約之準備工作，應由中，蘇，美，英四國外長會議負責辦理，因此，四個國家曾在日本投降書上簽字，而此等國家對戰後日本問題之特別關切，係爲一九四五年十二月之莫斯科協定所承認者。至於遠東委員會之其他各國，則可參加特別委員會與小組委員會，此項辦法，足以保證對此等國家之利益，不致被漠視云。</p>

<h3>毛澤東抨擊美國　報吿共軍十項作戰計劃</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山一日電〕中共領袖毛澤東，曾於十二月二十五日向該黨中央執行委員會提出報吿，文長一萬字，中共電台今日廣播其第一部，其餘部份將於三日內陸續廣播。渠稱：美國正在指導反革命戰爭，「以對付中國民族之獨立及中國人民之解放」。中共軍隊則在採取全面攻勢，此種攻勢「定必使東半球受帝國主義壓迫之十萬萬人民歡欣雀躍獲得鼓勵，抑亦爲歐美兩洲若干國被壓迫民族之一種聲援」。毛氏並報吿共軍十項作戰計劃，其內容着車於集中兵力，重點擊破，避免佔領任何大城市，以待將來。中共電台二日廣播毛澤東所提報吿之第二部，內稱：中共正在淸黨，剷除要津不穩份子，此等不穩份子係於一九三七年至一九四七年間共黨黨員擴充至二百七十萬人時混入，其中有地主，有當農，把持農村區域，黨政機關及民衆國體，壓迫人民，歪曲黨政策，致使各該機關國體與民衆脫節，並使農村改革計劃無法實行，紅軍士兵亦須改編肅淸。</p>
<p>〔合衆社舊金山三日電〕據此間三日晚截獲之中共領袖毛澤東新年致詞（在陝北電台廣擴），抨擊美國準備戰爭，並計劃在不遠的將來，發動第三次世界大戰，以擊敗民主勢力。（下接二版二欄）</p>

<h3>主席電賀緬獨立　緬駐華代辦在京舉行盛大酒會　大使館定今日正式開館</h3>

<p>緬甸於本月四日正式宣佈獨立；自由的緬甸共和國即於獨立之良辰誕生，中緬地壤密接，素爲兄弟之邦，茲值緬甸獨立之期，我國除派外次葉公超以特使名義前往致賀外，自　蔣主席以次，政府首長均分別電達緬甸總統總理及外交部長，申表賀忱。本報對緬甸人民爭取獨立自由，素表同情與重視，附未來之中緬關係尤表關切。今日緬甸獨立吿成，刈獲豐果，吾人謹致萬分誠摯的賀忱，並對中緬幫交之重建，表示無窮的歡慰。一九四八年爲東南亞愉快之年，吾人深信今後中緬善鄰相處，必能繼續堅强的聯合，致力於亞洲之重建，共爲謀求人類幸福而努力。</p>
<p>緬甸位於中南半島西部，西南濱孟加拉灣。全境分爲上緬甸與下緬甸兩部：上緬甸連接中國之雲南西康，正其國之東北面；下緬甸東倚暹羅，西接印度。山脈純爲中國橫斷山之餘脈；伊洛瓦底江純由康藏高地所發源。以緬甸之山，中國之餘脈，緬甸之水，中國之支流，彼與中國歷史上親善的關係，如非先天已注定其命運，何以土壤之相連，地形之相類，血脈之流通，有如是的親切！中華的歌聲，緬人聞之，悅耳感動。緬甸風俗，接近華人，有如兄弟之衣。吾人每瀏覽緬中圖籍，則瑞毛度之古浮屠，仰光之大金塔，申沙雍之臥佛，貝爾穹之闊港，以及白古舊址，土瓦溫泉，　心　　往，低徊無旣。中緬地理，人文，風俗等等，這樣的親切相類，決非偶然的結成，而乃萬年千載休戚相關，憂患相共的說明。</p>
<p>中緬關係，有三千年光榮的歷史，彰著史乘。一般中緬史籍圖經，不僅有光榮的紀載，並有雄偉的歌聲，躍然於紙上。依歷史書文考評，中緬關係，始於後漢永元九年（西曆九七年），中斷於淸光緒十二年（西曆一八八六年），凡一千七百八十九年；前乎此者無可考，後乎此則屬於中英間之關係。最不幸的，是中英交涉關於滇緬邊界之爭，迄今尙有一段未定界，成爲待決之懸案，雖然中緬關係中斷了六十年，而六十年間中緬並肩對日作戰，可算是中緬直接關係復活之先聲。我國政府戰時陪都重慶，緬甸訪華團曾來訪問，帶來了高深的友誼，繼之中緬文化協會的成立，兩國國民外交活動，未嘗中輟，且與日俱增。這些事實，說明中緬關係因過去的悠久歷史，以及共同對日作戰而益見深厚。這次中緬兩國在英緬協定甫吿簽訂，雙方政府即同時互換太使，表徵中緬關係之重建，實有友愛深遠歷史之由來。吾人對此間斷了六十一年的中緬直接關係，又復重新建立，衷心非常欣慰。今日緬甸完成獨立大業，吾人歡慰的情懷一如緬人，對未來中緬關係之鞏固，更是深信而不疑的。</p>
<p>中英交涉史上懸而未決的滇緬邊界問題，是中英歷史關係的不幸，吾人不願此一不幸的邊界之爭，繼續構成中緬間的不愉快。因此，吾人希望，在中英邦交敦睦之際，英國應自動退讓在滇邊佔據地帶，以消弭歷史上之舊惡，尤希望在中緬界綫勘定之日，不再將中國軍隊流血遍　莽的戶拱河谷，和過去被侵的江心坡劃入緬甸版圖。吾人相信開明的英國政府和緬甸的賢明領導者，必能憶及這次大戰中我遠征軍在緬甸的光榮戰績，彪炳史乘。索吉之役，東瓜之役，仁安羌之役，爲了掩護英軍撤退，我遠征軍自陷重圍，戴安瀾師長且因而殉國。二年後，我軍又自印度出擊，捲土重入緬甸，於戶拱河谷及孟拱河谷，擊敗了當年頑强的日寇，打通中印公路，替緬甸光復了一半的河山。中華男兒血染的山河，貢獻了中英和中緬高貴的友情。吾人所以追述及此，並無奢求任何報酬的意念，唯一希望祗是：往昔英軍侵據的中國邊界，應依據法律和事實，返還中國，藉以確定我西南邊陲之天然疆界。英國的政治家，尤其是開明的工黨政府領導人物，有遠識，有作爲，諒能打破傳統，爲戰後新的中英邦交，創立新的途徑。緬甸新邦，不乏高瞻遠矚之士，當緬甸立國更生之際，吾人更確信有理智有抱負的緬甸政治家，必能以快慰報善鄰。</p>
<p>吾人慶祝緬甸獨立與緬甸共和國之誕生，願望間斷了六十一年的中緬關係，從昨天（四日）的良辰起，有新的開始，新的創造，爲東南亞開闢和平愉快的大道。</p>
<p>蔣主席率領文武僚屬於元旦謁陵時情形（中央社攝）</p>
<h3>行憲首度開國紀念　主席勉全民完成戡亂建國</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕中華民國開始實行憲政之首度開國紀念，國府元旦舉行慶祝典禮，晨十時蔣主席率領中央政府官員恭謁國父陵寢，並獻花致敬。午後二時起，駐京各國使節紛赴國府簽名賀年。國府元旦舉行慶祝開國紀念典禮，主席勗勉全體官員繼續努力，完成戡亂建國任務。</p>
<p>張院長廣播</p>
<p>張院長則於元旦向全國廣播，題爲「軍民協力同心，完成甚亂建國」。晚間八時，張院長並發表廣播演說，題爲「全民政治和全民事業」：　全力協助戡亂，恢復國家的統一和安定。　尊重法律與秩序的精神和愛好自由的精神。　均平民族的獨立自由和民生的富庶。盼人民共同作長期的努力，完成此偉大的使命。</p>
<p>于院長廣播</p>
<p>于院長元旦在軍中廣播電台向全國官兵廣播，題爲「今年是行憲與戡亂成功之年」。勉全國軍民提高警覺，共同奮發，共同努力，以達成建設三民主義新中國的歷史使命。中央組織部長陳立夫，三日晚應中央廣播電台之請，作新年廣播，題爲「自信與自强」。</p>
<p>胡適之感言</p>
<p>此外，北大校長胡適於微恙初愈，發表行憲之感言，渠强調此憲法，實較過去憲章憲法約法爲健全，但認爲本法中若干十條之實行時，有種種困難，政府各級人員必須對憲法詳細研討，並立即作實行之一切準備工作，方能克服困難。繼謂：憲法中有若干絕對性之規定，實屬進步之基本大法，胡氏並盛讚憲法第二章對人民的權利義務規定之進步。認爲第八條之規定，「一·法院不得拒絕人民要求提審，二·不得先向拘捕機關要求解釋答覆之類，三·拘捕機關對於提審不得拒絕或遲延，四·違反上三點，即爲犯法」及第一七二條規定「命令與憲法或法律抵觸者無效」，均爲重要特點。渠稱：政府與人民應詳細研究瞭解各條文，政府對其中在實行上有困難之點，應向國民大會請作有限期之保留，而人民必詳知憲法內容，方能取得其應有權利，並善盡其義務。胡氏一再强調謂：憲法之實行，政府須有一百分忍耐。胡氏並暢論其他諸問題，如總統權利，行政院與立法院權限，基本國策一章之理想，學齡兒童義務敎育及總預算百分之十五敎育經費等。其結論稱：若干條文，雖因物質時間之限制，有待於政府之準備，不克即行實現，然均可做到，值此行憲之始，新年更新之時，甚望舉國一致，澈底予以實行。</p>
<h3>毛澤東報吿內容</h3>
<p>（上接一版）毛澤東稱：美帝國主義現正建立奴役世界之計劃，且跳入歐亞各地，宛如猛獸，將各國反動勢力組織帝國主義的反民主陣綫，攻擊以蘇聯爲首的一切民主力量。</p>
<p>又稱：全世界民主力量必須擊潰此種計劃，且必能擊潰此種計劃，世界反帝陣營之實力，現已超過帝國主義陣營之實力，優勢在吾人之一方，非在敵人之一方。以蘇聯爲首的反帝陣營業已組成，社會主義蘇聯旣向上昇，又無經濟恐慌，且爲全世界廣大羣衆所　戴，故其實力業已超過帝國主義之美國，蓋美國旣向下降，又受經濟恐慌之嚴重威脅，且爲全世界廣大羣衆所反對，歐洲新民主諸國已在國內加强團結，在國外互相聯繫，歐洲資本主義諸國人民之反帝力量，以法·義兩國爲首，現在增長中，拉丁美洲人民已非全屬順從美國之奴隸，全部亞洲均已崛起民族解放運動，歐洲九國共產黨已發表宣言，號召全世界人民參加戰鬥，起來反抗帝國主義，此戰鬥之號召，已激勵全世界被壓迫之人民，對其指示鬥爭之方向，加强其勝利之信心。</p>
<p>毛澤東之廣播詞明吿世界謂：一俟該黨基本政綱得以實現，中共亟擬建立統一戰綫之「堅定領導」，以管治中國，中共現正依循其「發展進步力量，克服中間力量，孤立死硬派」之政治路綫　渠以雄辯之口吻問曰：「美國果能以巨量之援助，不斷給予各國反動派乎？否也。美帝國主義之經濟實力，在第二次世界大戰中雖已增長，但目今則遭逢國內外市場之不穩定與削減，如再削減，則將引起經濟恐慌爆發，美國之戰時繁榮，僅爲一時之現象，美國之實力，僅爲人爲的，經濟恐慌一經爆發，則有如火山威脅現在坐於火山上之美帝國主義矣。」</p>
<p>渠結論係斥責悲觀主義，稱：「吾人必須將吾人營壘內之一切轉弱無能之思想肅淸，凡過高估計敵人力量，過低估計人民力量之觀點，均屬錯誤，吾人自當深信前途困難障礙重重，如吾人能把握馬列主義之科學，則吾人將必能渡過重重難關，擊敗敵人」。</p>
<p>渠稱：資本主義已走向滅亡，社會主義及民主則走向勝利。</p>
<p>渠模擬英國戰時首相邱吉爾之句子，結束其洋洋一萬言之文吿稱：「黎明之光，已在吾人面前，吾人應努力前進。」</p>
<h3>李濟琛在香港領導反動組織</h3>

<p>此措詞激烈之宣言，歷述該黨於一九二四年孫中山創立以來之歷史後，即抨擊稱：廿年於茲，孫中山之遺志迄未實現，宣言號召實行孫氏之三民主義，但鑒於廿年來之變化，亦有略加修正之必要：</p>
<p>「必須聯合以平等待我之民族」應加「聯合蘇聯」。</p>
<p>「中國各民主政黨團結起來」，包括：共產黨及民主同盟。</p>
<p>「耕者有其山，工人有工做」。</p>
<p>該宣言亦要求「反帝反封建」。據稱：此實與實行三民主義不可分，蓋「美國反動派意圖毀滅中國也」。</p>

<h3>兪財長在參會報吿</h3>
<p>（上接一版）俞氏繼報吿作爲國家稅原四大支柱之關稅，鹽稅，直接稅，貨物稅四種稅收之實際情形稱：</p>
<p>去年關稅收入，爲二萬二千餘億；較之原預算超收三億以上。但在目前進口貿易管理之下，因嚴格限制若干進口貨物，同時獎勵輸出，爭取外匯，若干貨物免稅出口，故稅源不易暢旺。且走私問題極爲嚴重，緝私案件達一萬八千餘件，沒收私貨，達一千五百五十餘億元。現在與香港政府，商訂協助緝私草案，日內即可簽字。</p>
<p>鹽稅收入，總預算原列五千三百餘億，截至十二月中旬，已收一萬餘億，運往日本食鹽，達二十萬噸，以易取住產器材。去歲鹽稅雖經兩度調整，然目前稅率僅及戰前百分之五十。</p>
<p>直接稅收入，預算原列九千四百餘億年底將不止此數，俞氏並報吿，關於課徵財產稅問題，財部業已擬定方案，俟呈准國務會議通過即可施行。</p>
<p>貨物稅收，總預算原列一萬八千餘億，但實際收入已達三萬七千餘億惟貨物稅係依照從價徵稅，施行不能切實，如稅額過萬，即妨碍生產，過低則影響稅收，今後當盡力兼顧　俞氏繼强調整頓稅制極關重要，年來力求改進稅制，減縮機構，卅六年度裁汰稅務人員七千餘人，並厲行考試制度，提高人才水準。並稱：本人不　担保稅務人員不貪污，且一經查出，即予懲辦。去年因貪污雜撤職人員計二百五十七人，免職六十八人，停職五十九人，通緝七人。渠繼指陳，稅務人員中，亦多能刻苦從公。俞氏嗣述及租稅以外之收入，如公債收入及物資收入概況稱：去年度美金短期庫券及美金公債銷募成績欠佳，蓋由於物價高漲，債券利益還不如市塲利潤。關於地方財政，全年省市支出爲二萬六千餘億，由中央補助者二萬一千餘億，各地因共匪作戰，致臨時支出激增。俞氏繼報吿金融設施情形，略謂：爲加强金融管理及銀行錢莊之管制，業已設立金融管理局，專負檢查監督之責，並嚴格取締金融買賣，限制銀行貸款，藉以緊縮銀根，同時改訂外匯管理辦法，並謀改善僑匯，去年度進出口貿易，入超四萬二千七百餘億，進出相差百分之五十，但較比卅五年度之百分之七十，入超已稍減少。俞氏於檢討去年度財政金融重要措施後，嗣闡述卅七年度工作計劃，將側重於中央及地方財源，整頓稅收，藉以增加國庫收入。最後强調欲求預算平衡，必須全面管制特價，俾穩定幣值，蓋物價問題爲整個經濟問題，不能頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，而政治，軍事與經濟乃爲一整體，尤須統一配合，始能協力推進。</p>
<p>改善公務員待遇　待國務會通過後實行</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕文武　公敎人員待遇之調整辦法，將於本週五舉行之國務會議中通過後施行。　某府委四日晚語記者，該項調整方案，前後經府委會特　審查會數度討論，已獲結論。其原則爲底　卅元，以生活指數計算，卅元以上　　按百分之十計算。</p>

<p>〔路透社斯德哥爾摩三日電〕著名瑞典癌　專家員兩文敎授，奉蘇聯　局之急召，三日乘飛機　此赴莫斯科，協助診治一最重之　症。敎授於啓程前，雖表示雖奉急召，猶不知病人爲何人。但據其同僚稱，該一未宣布姓名之病人，乃史達林元帥。貝爾文敎授係於三日晨飛芬京希爾辛基，蘇政府專機已在該地迎接，載貝氏逕飛莫斯科。</p>
<p>據貝氏之同僚稱，貝爾文乃無黨派人物，乃斯德哥爾　　錠醫院院長，對癌症治療有極豐富之經驗。渠院中病人甚多，診務至爲忙碌，苟非蘇聯要人，決不致擺脫診務前往莫斯科，而蘇聯要人中之傳正患病者，僅史達林一人，預料貝爾文抵莫斯科後，蘇當局將請求起　決不向他人宣布病人之身份。另一足證貝爾文之病人乃史達林本人之理由，乃爲蘇聯當局並未經由蘇駐瑞大使館轉召貝爾文前往，而爲直接致電貝氏，由此可證該病人乃一極重要之人物，蘇聯決不　洩　其健康狀態，即該病人之病狀已有顯著之轉劣，仍須急召瑞典專家治</p>
<h3>美海軍陸戰隊一批　開赴地中海服務　一般認爲美支援義希又一表示</h3>

<h3>英首相抨擊蘇聯　共產主義業已形成帝國主義　主張應由工黨領導歐洲</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三日合衆電〕艾德禮首相本日支持美國對蘇聯之「冷戰」，渠作警語稱，正在咸脋歐洲之共產主義，現巳形成帝國主義。艾氏以工黨政府首揆之資格，自戰爭結束以來，首次直率猛烈攻擊蘇聯共產主義。渠稱，今日共黨在東歐之所爲，業已剝奪西歐傳統精神之個人自由及民主政治</p>
<p>艾氏係在工黨成立六十五週年紀念向全國作政治性廣播演說時，對蘇聯之共產主義，作顯明及一般性「共產主義」一辭之攻擊，渠稱：于蘇聯之歷史，供吾人一項警吿，此即政治自由及集體主義，能迅速消逝，而為新形式之壓迫主義所取代。蘇聯之共產主義，遵循新帝國主義，無論在理論經濟及策略方面，足以威脅歐洲其他國家之禍利及生活之方式。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕英工黨人士認爲艾德禮首相向英國人民發表之政治演說，雖名爲黨內的政治廣播，實則其國際意義遠在對內意義之上。艾德禮之公開主張由工黨領導歐洲國家，在共產主義與資本主義之間進入民主社會主義，尙屬破天荒第一次。艾德禮之捍定正當英國在經斗濟方面已獲相當成就之今日，發表此種主義性的宣傳，意在使其言論獲得更多之實力。法社會黨領袖勃魯姆於去年十一月亦曾發表類似之言論，然結果不能獲得法國國會之支持。而艾德禮之背景，則與勃魯姆有顯者之不同，艾　禮在國內有議會多數之支持，而英國在西歐之經濟合作中，則佔有領導之地位，自能給予其言論以更多之力量也。</p>

<p>杜魯門原定四月一日為最後批準馬歇爾援歐方案之期限，然白宮人士漏露，杜魯門　於英·法·義等國之極可能於該日以前即行陷入最嚴重之經濟困難，故　再事提早此一期限，總統認為援歐復與方案茍於六月一日以前尙不獲最後完成，將引起悲慘之後果，卒不得不再事需要提出另一對歐救急援助許劃。參院外交委員會將於本週中期開始聆取就援歐方案之意見，屆時馬歇爾國務卿亦將強調歐洲需要援助之急迫性。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎百電〕若干人士甚至預料許曼政府荀不能迅速恢復國家經濟及糧食供應之穩定，則戴高　將軍於四月問即有　　政權之望。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕法政府之拯救法郎新方案，在國會中遭遇多方抨擊，許曼總理已向國民議會第二次要求對其投信任票。共產黨及右翼議員對該案第三條關於農人繳付特別所得稅義務之條文復提出六項修正案，許曼總理遂二次要求投信任票。根據法國憲法，信任票經政府要求後，須隔一整天始能表決，許曼總理因此建議，政府若就數點要求信任票，宜於同日交付表決，以節省時問。按政府所提第一次方案規定征收之特別所得稅總額約爲一千五百五十億法郞，新方案已　　　減少三分之一，減爲一千二百五十億法郞。據觀察家指稱，許曼總理之表示決以政府之存亡，就該案作孤注之一　顯示此成立甫吿五週之許受政府，復又面臨危機，而其時正偵所謂「第三派」之中問路錢政黨，力圖　固其地位，以抗共產黨及戴高樂派左右夾攻之際，然政府之問意减低特別所得稅額三分之一，已顯示「第三派」之弱點，此許曼新內閣，　將再度　吿。</p>

<h3>在地檢處報到室中冷眼看各階層人物　不問你身份如何到此一律平等：說不盡奇形怪狀各有各地表情</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕坐在地檢處報到室半小時，看一看大上海各階層人物的縮影，是十分右趣味的事。</p>
<p>一切刑事案件，除了少數的特種刑事與自訴而外，大都要經過偵査階段，以決定起訴與不起訴。以上海而樍之大，人口之密，每日人與人之間的衝突與糾紛之頻繁，一經牽涉到法律上的問題，第一道關口就是地檢處，而偵査時的第一道關口又是報到室。因此，報到室每日就有應接不暇，戶限爲穿之　了。</p>
<p>當吿訴人或被吿接到撿察官的傳票之後，傳票上寫明日期和時間，按時到地檢處，將傳票出示給報到室値日法警看，由法警登錄簿上，並塡好點名單，當承辦該案的檢察官開庭時，値庭法警持點名　呼喚被傳人，依序由法警率領，走入規定的偵査庭，受檢察官訊問。偵査期間是絕對秘密的，禁止任何人旁總，檢察官訊畢，按其情節輕重，於點名單上批收押，交保，或飭回三種。</p>
<p>兩個例外。不同表情</p>
<p>你別　不起這兩間並不堂皇的平房，許多達官，顯宦。富商。巨賈。釋。道。婦女以及小　三之流，都要在這兒坐冷板櫈，如行總副署長李卓敏，安樂紡織廠總經理鄧仲和，前燃料管理委員會主任委員徐樂天，前國行業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，金老虎詹運生，洋老虎梅斯伯，冒充女推事的祝黃方白，龍華寺的和尙永　，心慈，　證，性空，靜修庵的女尼法悟，法　，融洲，林淸，形形色色，各界的人都有，不論平時如何豪華氣派，到了此時，都收歛起來，靜坐一隅聽候傳訊。一年以來，不經過報到室而直接由檢察官　訊的，算算只有兩個例外：一個是前國行總裁貝祖詒，一個是前直接稅局局長樓國威。</p>
<p>冷眼看報到室各個候時的人各人有不同的表情，這是最好的觀察分析各人心理的塲所有的坐立不安，來往蹀讀，有的默無一語；閉目養神，有的口中念念有詞，似在演習到庭的答問；有的坐候太久，呼呼入睡；有被毆傷者呻吟不已；有烟毒犯癮發時，躺在地上直呌；種種奇形怪狀，不一而足。</p>
<h3>檢察官蒙寃痛恨黃牛黨</h3>
<p>因爲偵査期間是秘密的，一般被吿最怕收押，有些狡黠者利川被吿心理上的弱點，遂產了一批法院黃牛，這批人以附近幾家茶館爲太本營，揚言與裏而檢察官熟悉，可以設法交保，當事人不免要破費一點，本來這件案子情形並不嚴重，檢察官衡情　知交保或飭回，當事人不知內容，衷心感激黃牛的帮助，不幸而收押了，黃牛則掩飾說是運動的數目不够，而實際上　面檢察官蒙了不白之寃，所以地檢處常局對於這批黃牛痛恨極了，前次傳訊幾家茶館老　就是爲這件事情，自從那次傳訊之後，黃牛怕受法律制裁，稍稍歛跡，不敢過分明目張膽了。</p>

<h3>香港新年新訓　元旦日公布公務員加薪</h3>
<p>（本報香港一日航訊）這是英人再度入主香港的第三個新年，如果說第一個新年是「軍政年」，第二個是「商人年」，則這側新年便是「公務人員年」了。醞釀已久的港府公務人員加薪，卒於元且那天正式公布，月薪千元者增加百分之三十，一千五百元者加百分之二十，最俄薪金的工役加百分之二百，（但與高薪者比較則受惠最少。）而月薪在一百五十元以上者，還有至少一百元，至多四百八十元的「生活津貼費」，因此，一個中等公務員，過去月入二百元左右的，加薪後巳增至四百元以上。不特此也，加薪時間是從一九四七年一月一日算起，換句話說，一般公務員除自元旦起收入增加過半外，還可領得過去十二個月的補薪，少則四五百元，多則二三千元，港府已表示準於農　新年前全部發給，他們總可闊綽的眞正過一個「肥年」了！一般人正紛紛向公務人員道喜之中，有些公務人員卻半喜半懼的表示港府也許在補薪額中搭銷若十復與公債·一般商人對這件事已予十二分的重視。因爲以港府二萬公務員平均每人可獲補薪五百元計，則農暦前的市塲，將頓增一百萬元的購買力，在當前發疲的市塲上，實在是一　補藥。公務人員以外的一般受薪階級，對公務人員這個喜音，又羨慕，又擔憂，因爲他們不惟沒有加薪的機會，反要遭受百萬元刺激物價上漲的威脅。至於經濟學者懷疑港幣的通貨膨脹，因此更進一步的發揮了「高深理論」，且不必說了。這兩天，香港的氣候特別晴和而溫暖，頗有風和日麗之感，這是大自然所給與一般「憂息餘生」的　藉，倒是彌足珍貴的。（特約記者子健）</p>

<h3>篳路藍縷　湘桂路二三事</h3>
<p>（本報衡陽三日訊）打開湘桂　區鐵路圖一看，這個區城內有着四條綫路，恰恰像個X字形，也像一個細腰女人躺在那裏，高舉雙臂，撑開兩腿，她的左臂伸到湖南的衡陽，和她的姊姊—粤漢路—握手；右臂舒展到雲貴高原上的貴陽；一條腿兒跨過十萬大山路在鎭南關上；另一條腿伸進廣州灣去。現在，她的左臂已經活絡了，右臂也在漸漸復甦，只有兩條腿還在麻痺　　狀態中。幾時能够站起來？以目前的情形來看，還不知是何年何月！</p>
<h3>砲火無情　毀滅了她的雙臂</h3>
<p>這個細腰女人的心腸部位在柳州。由柳州到衡陽的這隻左臂，就是湘桂黔區鐵路的湘桂綫，全長五百六十公里，經過雒容·永福·桂林·興安·全縣·冷水灘·達衡陽市。她是西南的大動脈，抗戰期間才修建起來，於軍事經濟的運輸，會盡過莫大的貢獻。不幸在三十三年秋，湘桂軍事失利，敵寇西侵，這條戰時西南大動脈，淪入敵手。接着敵寇以破竹之勢，直指黔東，她的右臂—黔桂綫—亦遭摧殘。當時我們對敵是「焦土抗戰」「堅壁淸野」，鐵路自然在這個政策下需要破壞。當路局員工撤退前夕，所有橋樑隧道涵洞機車車輛等重要工程及設備，均遭到無情的毀滅，尤其橋樑涵洞爲最澈底，湘桂錢上大小橋共百餘座，涵洞也在五十座光景，都在數在的短時間內破壞的一乾二凈。</p>
<h3>重此薄彼　延緩了兩年通車</h3>
<p>天亮以後，鐵路復員是國家復員工作中最重要的一部門。但是政府限於財力，不能使全國鐵路同時復員，只能權衡當時的輕重，先以全力修復比較急需復修的路。津浦·平漢·粤漢諸路，就是當時比較念需的。湘桂　區鐵路，並不是不重要，不過比較平漢·粤漢諸路，在全國復員之初要次要一點。因此抗戰勝利後的兩年，衝桂段才告通車，這條路延遲至兩年後的今天通車，不明瞭內情者看來，也許認爲不値得如何稱道。其實，此次湘桂路的通車，在西南交通史上固然値得大書特書，而其艱苦奮鬥的事蹟，在今日國內任何一條鐵路復修時都未見到。上月聯總外籍人員曾往參觀復修工程，對湘桂錢此次的奮鬥情形，嘆爲工程史上的奇蹟，誠然不是一種過譽。</p>
<h3>拆移補充　巧婦竟爲無米炊</h3>
<p>湘桂綫於本年元月間即先通柳州至桂林段，接着開始由桂林至衡陽的復軌工作。交部限令本年十二月底完成全淺通車，但是材料異常缺乏；尤其是全縣到衡陽一段二百三十公里的鋼軌連配件，在趕修粤漢路時拆移去了，這麼長的一段鋼軌和枕木無法補充，眞是巧婦難爲無米之炊。交部看到這種情形，曾允撥鋼軌二百六十公里，枕木三十五萬根，但後來因爲種種關係，始終是只聽樓梯響，沒見人下來。路同方面，在不得已的情形不，只好權衡輕重，移緩濟急，以應付環境，將南丹至金城江一段路軌，及其他一切　綫，拆移補充，因此工作上更增加了很多困難。（特派員黃潮如）</p>

<h3>港督蒞京面商後　金融協定今日實行運港轉口貨須呈繳證明書攜帶國幣以五百萬元爲限</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於中港協定各方至爲關切。茲據中央銀行發言人告稱：該協定係於上年八月十五日簽訂。嗣因雙方環境上發生變化，故港方尙須作相當之調整。經港督蒞京面商後，決定將協定中下列若干條款，先行實施，現己準備就緒，開始實行。</p>
<p>自一月五日起，我國主要出口貨，如銻·錫·錫·桐油·菜油·猪鬃·棉紗·等運港轉口，須呈繳「CBC8a修正式」證明書，證明該貨由中國裝運香港所得之外匯，業經售給或訂明將褒給與中國指定銀行。否則，香港政府不准轉運出口。</p>
<p>國行發言人稱：此舉對於中國出口外匯之管理，爲極有價値之帮助。預料我國政府外匯收入，可望增加。因之，華南方面進口外匯之限額，最近己酌予放寬。</p>
<p>自同日起，香港政府禁止攜帶國幣五百萬元以上之現鈔進出。此舉與中國現行限制裝運現鈔辦法相同。香港政府現正制定法則，管理一般銀行，此爲香港政府對於年來在港紛紛設立之所謂銀錢業組織，在管理上較前更臻嚴密之辦法。同時，使我國對於逃避現行管理辦法，非法牟利之現狀，更得有力之制止。</p>
<p>金融協定中有一項，凡由港駛華之船隻，其貨單必須經香港政府加蓋鈐記。此項辦法，業己實施。</p>
<p>此次金融協定所訂一切條款，係彼此聯貫之具體辦法。雙方政府，本合作及善意之精神，經過愼重及精密之磋商，務使雙方利益兼顧，方得有此成就。該項協定，實爲在我國與香港關係上樹立一重要之里程碑。</p>
<p>至於該協定內尙有其他步驟之實施，亦在積極　商中。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港四日專電〕香港政府宣稱：今後此問若干指明之中國產品，如鎢，銻，羊毛，油類，菜油，錫茶，猪鬃，棉紗等，自香港出口，必須附有中國當局所發給之出處證件。並稱，該政府此項措施，係在帮助中國保障其主要出口貨物之外匯收入，但出口貨如非中國土產，則此種證件不必需要。目前此間儲存中國出產貨物之存戶，必須將所存之貨物，於本月八日前，在香港進出口貿易部登記。此項登記之存貨，將不受此項新措施之限制。</p>
<h3>產區報漲到貨稀少　滬白粳劇烈波動　市府電蘇省府迅平產區價格</h3>
<p>新年各業休假期間，本市米價上漲頗鉅，南北市塲雖未正式開市，但搶購者甚衆，持貨者執貨不售，形成有價無市狀態。三日市塲價格，經當局竭力勸導，白粳開盤價每祖一二〇萬元，零售價格則殊混亂。</p>
<p>據警局經濟科調査，米價之漲因在於：　產區報漲，　到貨稀少，　市塲不正常，　郊區有塲外交易，　本市各業職工之年賞，相繼發放，此鉅額游資，爭以購進食米爲對象，零售商之存貨，經市民爭購後，又急於補進，一再哄抬。</p>
<p>市政當局除已電請蘇省府迅速壓平產區米價，疏暢運輸外，並令經濟　察於五日全體出動，分赴米市塲及其他各市塲監視，以期壓平一般物價。</p>
<p>拋售食米尙未考慮</p>
<p>又訊：南北米市塲自二日開　後，即直綫上漲，前日（三日）無錫產地白粳，報價每担一百廿五萬元，北市塲隨即上漲，收盤價在一百卅萬元以上，零售超過一百四十萬元。吳市長因此致電行政院張院長，要求電令江蘇省府，迅即制止無錫米價之飛漲，並電請糧部中國農民銀行，停止產地搜購。關於社局必要時是否恢復拋售政策，昨據吳局長稱：當局尙未考慮及此，且拋售如技術上不能應付裕如，反使商民有投囤機會，而消費者並無權利可得云。</p>
<h3>今年國紙增產決以報紙爲主</h3>
<p>國內目前最感缺乏之紙張，爲報紙，捲烟紙及鈔票紙三種。捲烟紙每月需十萬噸，滬民豐廠已產達六萬噸，今年可望自足。報紙則甚爲缺乏，亟待增產。全經會去年在京召開之紙業增產會議，決議今年度以報紙增產爲主，將估計劃數字之一半。進口對紙漿輸入放寬，提為百分之四十二，因普通一噸紙漿，可　入廢棉　　等二噸，可製報紙三噸，節省紙類外匯三分之二。資委會所屬各造紙公司，今年負擔　產紙一萬噸。但自目前各廠現狀觀察，殊感困難。東北五造紙廠只剩　陽一廠能生產，安東兩廠，當口一廠及錦州一廠，因遭破壞，生產已停頓。台灣各廠雖較發達，但原料仍感不敷。今年臺糖如能增產至六十萬噸，甘蔗桿可取用為製紙原料，可以供應其他各廠。至於天津郊外之製造廠，今後原料及電力如不缺乏，三號機專用以生產報紙，則平津二市用紙可望滿足。今年月產量至少須維持二百噸數量。原料方面，硫磺收購最感困難，葦漿造紙必需之苦土（即氧化鎂）原料，自大石橋失陷後，已無法供應。天津紙廠如欲增產至預定數量，現需大量採購蘆葦。至少要收買一萬五千噸，目前每噸市價二百萬元，共計三百億元。造紙廠方面本身，已感無能力籌集此項巨款云</p>
<h3>食糖漲勢勁</h3>
<p>食糖在新年休假期中，合灣公司第一期於二日仍照常配售，台赤綿白兩種價格無變更，惟同業間因冬銷發動，非正式交易極爲活躍，故價格一致上揚。其漲度如白糖升一成五六至一成許，赤糖升一成五六至一成許，靑糖因到存軋缺，升一成九至一成五六。預測今日市面，或可稍平，但須視實銷陽否而定。</p>
<p>菉笋高漲</p>
<p>菉　因冬銷當令，開價一再上展，新年休假期內，如高貨綉尖綉湖兼搭副牌，開至八百萬元，　勢甚俏。</p>
<h3>中國農工銀行遷移新址營業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國農工銀行，民七創立，至今　三十年，茲以業務發展；原有行址不敷應用，爰在四川路新置百樓，定名農工大廈，今日遷入營業，同時舉行該行成立三十週年紀念，　邀各界參加。該行分支行共有十二處，上海分行為業務重心，經理為沈天夢，副理邵生榮，何品衡，熊之孚，郵大同等。</p>
<h3>新年休假期內華股塲外喊高</h3>
<p>前昨雖値新年假期，但塲外略有零星之交易做開，今日交割之永紗，曾喊高至六百元大關，最後五八五元有供。港申電年尾已報縮至三元以內，人心依然俏利，預計今日紅盤中遞永紗當在六百元關邊。</p>
<p>證交公吿開做遞交</p>
<p>證交市塲公吿云：　第六二期遞延交割交易，定一月五日（星期一）前市開做，至一月七日（星期三）前市止，二月九日（星期五）交割，特此通吿。</p>
<p>案准財政經濟部上海證券交易所監理員辦公處，三十七年一月三日監（三七）字第八一○號公函開，案準財政經濟部錢幣商業司本年一月二日幣己，京商三七字第一，四〇〇〇一號函開：「査關於上海證劵交易所遞延交割交易應否正式一案，業經本兩部呈奉行政院核準，照現行辦法正式辦理。除另由兩部行知外，相應先行函達，即希査照轉知」等由。准此，相應函達，即希査照爲荷」等由。本所遞延交割交易，自當照現行辦法正式辦理，特此公吿。</p>

<h3>進口應稅貨品　增收附加稅百分之四五</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據江海關昨公吿：進口應稅貨品（棉花·米·麵粉·煤·及煤焦·原照官價結匯貨品，及汽油。煤油。柴油。已增加進口稅之貨品除外），應自本年一月一日起，至六月三十日止，於現行海關附加稅外，加徵臨時附加稅百分之四十五，兩種附加稅合爲百分之五十，業經本關於本年一月一日，以第一八一號布吿周知在案。茲査前項貨品，於本年一月一日以前報關進口，經本關簽發稅款繳納證者，如未於規定自發證日起十五日內繳淸稅款者，該項稅款繳納證，應照章作為無效，由本關簽發新稅款繳納證，並加徵臨時附加稅，所有前項逾期之稅款繳納證，應即呈繳本關總務課註銷。</p>
<h3>到埠自備外滙物資　申請收購手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕到埠自備外匯物資收購問題，各項辦法細則，進口商與中央信託局已取得原則上之同意。且紙張及鋼鐵加成數，業已商定公布，其餘五金銅錫木材原料顏料等，亦均開始研商，在近期內，當可絡續解決。關於申請收購及申請承購之詳細手續。進口商方面容多不甚明瞭之處，記者特走訪此次代表十六業同業公會，向常局接洽之總代表華洪　消，詢關於自備外匯到埠物資之申請收購與承購之詳細手纖，據吿如下：</p>
<p>當該業物資之加成數公布後，進口行商如願意將到埠物資售與政府者，則應即將輸管會秘書處所發還之登記副本，寫信一封，表明願意收購，或附加收購後希望仍由申請人優先承購等語，隨檢提單正本（背書勿簽）發票正本，及塡好之申請許可證一式六份，送由指定銀行轉送輸管會主管處，（附表一及三類貨品屬非限額處主管，附表二類屬分配處主管。）</p>
<p>輸管會主管處收到上項申請後，經過審核，即送簽證處將許可證簽證，俟簽證後，即直接將許可證及提單等，送中信局購料處。</p>
<p>中信局購料處，獲得輸管會移送之件後，即塡發收購通知之信，直接發交原申請之進口行商，同時在該信內附有空白之「申請中信局收購書」一紙備用。</p>
<p>進口行商接獲中信局收購通知，應於兩星期內，將該收購書及應附各件塡就，親繳中信局購料處，同時向中信局索取優先承購申請書，及「售與直接用戶合約淸單」等件備塡。中信局在收到該收購書及附件後，即予塡給「收購證」，交原進口行商收執，該收購證即屬收購貨品之收據，將來憑此掉換特種外幣存單。</p>
<p>進口行商在中信局發給收購證後三星期內，須將「優先承購申請書」塡就後，隨同直接用戶定單一式兩份，以及直接用戶合約淸單一式十份，該合約淸單上應蓋有同業公會之證明圖章，繳向中信局申請優先　購。</p>
<p>中信局接此承購申請後，審查合於規定，即行通知原進口商行辦埋承購手續，原進口商得此通知後，即赴中信局簽訂合同，並覓股實舖保兩家，在合同上簽州保證，貨款則除付現款百分之廿五外，其餘百分之廿五為三十日期之商業承兌匯票，百分之五十為四十五日期之商業承兌匯票。上項手續完備，即向中信局將原提單借出，連同簽就之進口許可證，由原進口商辦理報關，（由原進口商先行提貨，其另外一張二分之一，則送還中信局爲抵押，同時抽回前開之「借提單保證書。」</p>
<p>俟四十五天期滿，最後一張承兌匯票由中信局收到無誤，然後由承購之原推口商，向中信局取回其餘一　之提單，以及存而未領之特種外幣存單。至此，申請收購及配售承購之手續，全部終了云。</p>

<h3>美國科學硏究的管理</h3>
<p>— 鄭佐卿</p>
<p>美國五十二個公立的科學硏究所正在三萬個科學家從事之下，化費了二十萬萬美金的設備，研究各類問題，包括番茄的防止病虫害以至原子能及癌症等等，去年公家科學研究的費用已超過六萬萬美金了，其中四萬萬美金是大學校及工礦和財務的硏究費用，至於私人研究的費用，據估計也値六萬美金，以上都是華盛頓國立科學的報吿。</p>
<p>去年十月，美國科學硏究部（Scientific　Research　Board）主任施德門（JohnR.Steelman）在他的論著，「科學研究的管理」一文中發表了整個美政府科學研究機關的重新改組計劃，這篇諭文中首先申述了科學硏究機關改組的需要。</p>
<p>「在今天國家正費了前所未有的財力，應用於科學的硏究及發展上，但是我們必須有個準確的方針，我們的目的是促進人類健康，增加吾人的幸福並改善生活水準，同時更必須顧及國防安全的需要，因此我們要求政府應該採取步驟，以達到最有效的利用」。</p>
<p>施德門提議了下列幾個步驟：</p>
<p>建立各種科學硏究部門的聯合委會員，以便統一籌劃，對於各部門的工作作通盤的打算，以達到可能的最大的收穫。</p>
<p>建立度支機構，以便審核各州研究計劃對於政府整個科學計劃的關係。</p>
<p>在大總統的參議團中，必須有一人　門負責傳遞科學家間科學秘密發明的消息於國會及科學行政有關部門。</p>
<p>國會應授設權立國立科學基金總機構，其中委員半數由政府科學硏究行政有關部門主任充任，半數由民間有聲望之大科學家及敎育人士充任之，該總機構有權處理各大學及各州硏究機關基金之分配。</p>
<p>在此長達三百二十四頁的論文中，施德門主任對於各項瑣屑問題，均經詳細討論，了無有遺漏，舉例言之，政府對於科學研究者，每年必須付以一萬五千元美金之年俸等等。</p>
<p>最後，該論文强調一般計劃的規定，並非隱含集中管理及新的律法控制。「欲充分達到全民最大幸福的鵠的，政府必須負此巨任，俾大量財力不致虛擲。在政府決定的同一目標之下，才能齊心合力，以底於成」。</p>
<h3>原子時代的原素鐠94</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>自從道爾敦（John　Dalton）創始原子說，化學家排列了心血凝成的週期表，由居里夫人（Madamc　Curie發現鐳而作各種放射性物質的硏究，到勞倫斯（Dr.O.E.　Lawrence擊破原子，在科學界上，眞是一連串驚人的變化和成就。</p>
<p>偉大的科學進展，使人類不僅能認識和運用一切物質，更着手創造他所需要的一切，放射物質的蛻變作用和分裂原子的硏究，就使人類從而發現新的原素，供人使用，鐠就是最新的產品。</p>
<p>到今日，這新元素不但已爲人製造成功，而希望能在最近蓬到大量製造的目的。</p>
<p>這一件工作完成，那末將是科學界動力界的革命完成，他引導着人類眞正踏上原子時代的道路，而完全改變今日的一切。因此這人類手創的原素，不但是一個最有力的前鋒，更將在原子時代，作中流的砥柱。</p>
<p>人類幾百年的審愼研究，和千萬次的實騐工作，把地球上創造一切物質的原料，分析和歸納到許多當時認為不可再分的物質基石—原子，而把他們排列成一個相當完美的表，一個九十二種原素的週期表。</p>
<p>這確是一個極有價偉的表，因為祇要我們知道一個原子的序數，就能在這表裏相當準確地知道他的性質，但是也有着二個令人不滿的地方，那就是表裏的許多空格和原子數的為什麼止於九十二。</p>
<p>科學家考察表未的原素，是有放射性的，因此推測那些未發現的原素，也是有着放射性和不穩性的。但那時候暗中摸索的工作正是二分困難的。這工作到一九三九年勞倫斯擊破原子後才露出一綫曙光。</p>
<p>驚人的棎索是開始在一個意大利科學家恩利柯，費彌（Eurco　Ferme）的手裏。可惜這硏究被引導到岐路上去，因為他用中子擾亂鈾二三五的結果，分裂所到的原素都遠遠地落在週期表的中間，而得不到一個新的原素。</p>
<p>直到一九四〇年才獲得了應循的途徑。</p>
<p>在這些前驅者裏有着不可磨滅的功績的二位是麥克米林敎授（Prof.　Ewdin　M.McMillan）和亞白生博士（Dr.philipA.Abelson）他們在美國加州的原子擊破機（Cyclotron）製馭着雙質子（Deuteron）來攻擊　化物時，得到了一種極微量的「人造原素」，那便是鈾變鐠的中間物—錼（Neptunium），可是由於量的太少，未能指出鐠的存在。</p>
<p>這時候，在對同一方向努力的還不西堡格（Glern　Segreorg）華商（Arthnr　C.Wah），肯納（Joseph　W.Keunedy）和西格里（Emilio　Segre）　到那年的冬天，用原子擊破機創造鐠的工作才正式完成，他們得到了極微量的鐠。雖然量是少得可憐，但科學家郤已可從此探知他的化學性和從放射性而硏究其變化了。在一九四一年的五月由勞倫斯發表了重要的報吿。</p>
<p>這不但使新原素的硏究開了新紀元，也曾影響了原子彈的硏究。因爲科學學家們指出，作爲原子彈原料的中鈾（U235）要在會量僅百分之一的重鈾（U238）巾提取，正有着重大的困難。我們正不必要把他提分，而由他在中子撞擊下自動分裂，轟變成一種新的元素，那便是鐠。節然鐠是比較穩固的，但分裂時，也同樣可以得到龐大的原子能力。因爲他在被擊時，也能自動混擾，分裂而產生新的中子，作爲轟擊質點而完成所謂連鎖反應（Chain　Reaction）（未完）</p>

<p>讀了周實民先生的「數字分節的漢化」（見本刋第二十一期），使我不由得驚恐起來了。因爲周先生要倡導我們用四位分節制了。我想這很有重新考慮的必要！</p>
<p>曾記得，在民國三十五年前，我們是靠左邊走的，三十五年後，改爲靠右了。本來靠左也好，靠右也好，無非是同道的相順而行，不至有對面相踫而已。那麼？爲什麼要改呢。無它，使中外有一致的標準而己。在國際間交接密切的今天，類似此種改進，芷是必要的；應該極積的推行，纔是正途。而今周先生反而要新建此種花樣，眞使我難解。我們可以想想，假設我們用四位分節制；無異的，外人點上了分節點的數字，我們就無法用；反之，我們點好的數字，外人也只好啞口不好認了。到那時我們將要受到，如同靠在走一樣的命遝，何苦呢？</p>
<p>不錯，依據目前的趨向，我們認數的方法，是走向四位分節制的。但是，我們並沒一個普遍習用的四位分節風氣，就拿萬萬爲億來說，那是到民卅三年，方纔正式規定的，已往我們還有用十萬爲億的。</p>
<p>展開我們的古算書，我們更可知道，吾國往古的記數法，除個·十·百·千·萬·外，以上的數位有三種不同：五經算術，緝古算經等都談到數位，有所謂：「黃帝爲法，數有十等，及其用也，乃有三焉；十等者億·兆·京·垓·秭·壤·溝·澗·正·載。三等者上·中·下也。其下數者十十變之，若言，十萬曰億，十億曰兆，……也。中數者萬萬變之，若言：萬萬曰億，萬億曰兆，，……也。上數者數窮則變，若言：萬萬曰億，億億曰兆，……也。」</p>
<p>由此看來，所謂的下數，僅是十進制的單純形勢，談不上分節。上數是四位一個小循環，大的分節是依着幾何級數增加，也不是純粹的四位分節制。只有中數是用四位分節的。因爲有了這上·中·下的三種規定，把我們幾千年來的數字，擾亂的沒有分節的習慣。在萬萬爲　定定後，九位以下的數字，可以說是行成了四位分節的意思，九位以上呢？誰也不知道十億為　，萬億爲兆，或者億億爲兆究竟那一種是對的；更談不上分節法了。而九位已下只是分兩節就完了，當然不能算是一種完全的四位分節習慣。</p>
<p>我們旣然沒有分節的習慣，現在僅用這種傾向就順水推舟，而且造成與已有的三位分節制來對抗，這眞是大可不必。三位分節制它本身並不比四位的壞；它流入我國，也並不如像仇貨一樣曾打破我們的平衡市塲；我們又何苦把它當仇貨看待呢？</p>
<p>其實，在民國十七年，已有人提倡我們用三位分節制了。高夢旦先生的「十三月曆法」的附錄內有云：民國十七年五月七日段撫羣·駱紹先兩先生，曾談三位分節法，大意是：</p>
<p>這種方法雖然早已被我們忘記了，但是它確是引我們用三位分節制的妙法。</p>
<p>所以，依我的管見，我們的分節法，還是取用段先生的三位分節制較好；其優點，也有三個：　記憶規則。　合於我國的習慣，並且不失先哲的原意。　與外國用法一致。我們可以直接認得外人分好節的數字；外人也一樣能直接認出我們分好節的數字。在認數字上，大家少費腦力。</p>
<p>現在我們是應當倡導學術標準化的，最好是能使全人類都採用一個標準，同心協力硏究世界上的學術；閉門造車的事，最好少來！</p>

<h3>愼防煤毒</h3>
<p>— 加另</p>
<p>上海平民居屋大都室小人稠，並無電爐，水汀壁爈等取暖設備。寒浪襲擊之下，關緊窗門，在亭子間或廂房中生一炭火爐，圍坐取暖，以解酷寒。或是生了炭爐在亭子間中洗澡。殊不知此乃自殺自戕！筆者曾目擊慘劇，所以不管你是否愛聽，我一定要請你留意。</p>
<p>每年冬令，死於煤氣中毒的必有數起。就是知識份子，通曉物理化學的人，也不免有疏忽，地質學家丁文江氏不是死於煤氣的嗎？</p>
<p>一氧化碳殺人不見血</p>
<p>煤炭在空氣不流通之處不能充分燃燒，常有一氧化碳發生。在窗戶緊閉的小房間中，炭爈當然不能充份燃燒，無嗅的一氧化碳產生，即刻可以發生不幸。壉E.P,Underhill報吿，居處於含有千分之五一氧化碳的空氣中，即足以致人死命。</p>
<p>最初是頭痛眩暈，　顧部的血管怒張搏動，且有　心及嘔吐症狀。心　搏動劇烈，血壓增高，臉部潮紅，不久之後脈搏速而小，呼吸深而長。巾毒加深，呼吸困難，失去知覺而昏迷不省人事。常中毒嚴重而尙未致命之際，智力極薄，思想糢糊，精神錯亂，所以即使自己發覺中毒已深，欲思挽救，已被心力與體力所不允許的了。小兒體弱，更易罹難。</p>
<p>一氧化碳吸入體內易爲血液吸收而產生「碳氧化血色素」（Carbon　Monoxide　Henoglobin）阻碍　氣的運輸。人體各組織缺乏氧氣，即失常態，在神經系統所受影響尤爲顯著，可能使神經遭受難以恢復的傷害。</p>
<p>救治方法</p>
<p>救治愈速愈妙，先應將中毒者移置於新鮮空氣中。如呼吸停止或甚微弱時，可行人工呼吸法，並以氨氣刺激其呼吸作用。</p>
<p>如能使中毒者吸入含有百分之五的二氣化碳與氧氣的混合劑爲最好的方法。體溫應保持常度，並進以心臓興奮劑。</p>
<p>注意點</p>
<p>一，冬令取暖應注意空氣流通。</p>
<p>二，如有陽光，宜作戶外遊戲，勿集居斗室。</p>
<p>三，留心向平民，尤其是無知識的主婦解說，功德必然無量。</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>營養</h3>
<p>— 景一</p>
<p>我們知道了食物的大槪性質，就可檢討食物和人生的關係，有些以爲個體和種族的特性往往由他們所進的特種食物而決定，更有些人相信以前英國的統治印度，赴是因爲英人是多吃肉食，同時印度人是多吃素食的關係。吃肉的人類走進　　業林，經過凶猛的博鬥，他們便捕得那些龐大的牛象等素食的動物，更有些獵人寗願走向森林去捕捉獅子，而不願到牧塲上去奪取農夫所養的牛，這或者多少與食物的影響有關吧！</p>
<p>醫生往往說，多吃米的外皮，可以醫好脚氣病，這的確是可能的事，因爲脚氣病完全是爲了缺乏維他命B而起，米的外皮含有這種寳貴的成分很多，可惜一般人都不願吃糙米，而得不到這種寳貴的營養。</p>
<p>更有一種關於消化率的討論，我現在先來解釋一個名詞；所謂「消化系數」。就是指動物所進食物之最後被吸入利用的分量而言。通常碳水化合物是食物組成中消化最完全的一種，它的化學組成較他種合物來得簡單。蛋白質中以動物蛋白質最易消化。植化性蛋白質次之，而混合食物的消化程度，顯然地較高於單一的食物，）現在對於碳水化合物與蛋白質不能相容的事實，還款有證明），共他如殼類澱粉質食物經過烹煮之後，對於人類的消化道似乎更爲適宜而且易於吸收；不過此種烹煮在根本吸收上並無什麼功用，只是縮短消化的時間而已。因爲天然的穀類，穀粒的四周往往有一層纎維質的鞘包圍着，煮熟以後實際就是把這層織織素變軟，同時使澱粉質分裂開來以備胃液進行它的消化作用。</p>
<p>食物通過常人全部消化道的時間，約在十二至十四小時的範圍之內，要是相當的食物經渦消化道超過或是不及這個限度的話，那就是一種反常的現象，碳水化合物或是蛋白質混以脂肪以後，脂肪便包圍着每個顆粒一定先行乳化，然後才能使消化　進入作用，這種消化的時間當然就來得長了。根據這種道理，我們使可以解釋爲什麼有些人吃了油炸的馬鈴　等油膩的東西後不易感覺到　？這就是因爲這些食物是一種含有脂肪的混合物，在胃中需要較長的時間來消化，因之他們便可藉此挨過整個上午的飢餓了。</p>
<p>當然一個動物過度疲乏之後，它的身體組織中便發生多量的乳酸（Lactic　acid）同時她的肌肉也比較來得柔弱，此外像受過劇烈驚嚇的動物，也有同樣的現象發生，所以我們選購肉食時，對於這點也要加以注意。</p>
<p>烹煮食物宜用適量之水，（這是在　任上最簡單而重要的方法，因爲這件小事卻與健康有相當關係。食物裏的礦物質與水溶性維他命往往靠了水才能行滲透作用，才可以進入腌內。然而在過量水中煮熟的蔬菜往往要夫去50%以上的礦物質（如鐵，鈣，憐，納，鎂，碘等化合物　液），而維他命除了因水煮而散失一部份於溶液中外，就是熱氣對它也要發生一種破壞作用。維他命最容易損毀，它除了能溶於水中之外，同時更在高溫度中起氣化作用而失去它對於人體生理上重要的功效。所以當我們吃麵的時候那最初的麵湯，實在不應拋棄。</p>
<p>這些食物方面的常識以及烹任上的要着，我們該認爲與人身健康最有關係。（續完）</p>

<h3>恭喜發財</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>欣逢大年初五，正是「接路頭」的好日，理該大家笑容滿面，說聲：「恭喜發財！」</p>
<p>或曰，恭喜發財云云，太俗。你難通不曉得古之雅人，稱銅錢爲「阿堵物」乎？再以至聖先師的遺敎爲證，則有「子罕言利」一條。若孟子便更容易了——開宗明義第一章，「孟子見梁憲王」下面不多幾句，就來了「亦曰仁義而已矣，何必曰利！」爲甚麼你在新平中竟然道道地地倒做到了「一說便俗」這四個字呢？</p>
<p>於是乎我要辯護了。蓋亦「不得已也」。</p>
<p>先從聖人說起。孔聖人可實在可敬可愛。你就看他這「子罕言利」四個字：「罕言」並非「不言」之謂，祗是並不一天到晚把「恭喜發財」掛在口頭罷了。若祇揀　新春裏對朋友們說聲「恭喜發財」，豈非極符「罕」言之旨，正合聖意？孟夫子則在取笑齊人的時候，先已略帶勢利眼睛，其等次屬於「亞」級，其地位等於羅斯福在世時的杜魯門，不必詳予駁斥了——須知梁惠王倒底是一國君主，一見了此「叟」便要好處，倒底也不免有失體統。然而孟夫子之一聽了便着急非凡，倒也正反映出此「叟」對「利」之一字，頗爲敏感。</p>
<p>我們還是再說孔夫子。</p>
<p>「子罕言利」道四個字實在妙——簡市愈想愈妙，其味無窮。「罕言」者，「不大掛在嘴上」也。嘴上不大說，心裏如何？我們從反面一想，便會恍然大悟，　爾一番。須知「罕」的對面就是「常」，「言」的對面就是「想」呀！</p>
<p>孔夫子之所以不但可敬而且也可愛者，正因爲他處處表現出他不是那種有意想不到的怪力的「神」，而是一個「人」——一個很能正視現實，性格很平易，而極審智慧與機智的「人」。爲甚麼美國商人做起廣吿來也會提起「孔夫子說……」？爲甚麼沒有什麼人去理會那些道貌岸然的周敦頤朱熹或者程氏弟兄？答案是：普天下的平常百姓（Man　in　the　street）想法大家差不多，我們嘴上也許不得不敷衍敷衍那些道貌岸然的大人先生，我們的心襄卻實在眞是討厭他們。我們願意接近那些願意和我們換近的人——孔子其一也。</p>
<p>中國古人做廣吿的天才　在並不在好萊塢影片商之下。要勸人讀書，就說：書中自有「黃金屋」，「千鍾粟」，而且竟還有「顏如玉」！不但對「食」「色」二要點，都能深體聖人之旨，居然對房　問題，也似乎光已有了預感。無怪乎有人廿願不怕變深度近視眼而映雪　　，也有人不怕竊盜嫌疑而鑒壁偸光，更有人强睜着惺忪的睡眼，對準自己的大腿就是那麼一錐了！</p>
<p>「黃金屋」頂費若千？「千鍾粟」又價値多少？「顏如玉」的灰背大衣也是省不了的——否則這側「顏」就會不如「玉」而如「鐵」了……</p>
<p>故讀書是工具，發財才是目的，其理至明——一年祗「言」一次，可調「罕」矣，不禁暢所欲「言」如上。</p>
<h3>托斯卡尼尼</h3>
<p>— 程俊濤</p>
<p>現在紅得發紫的義大利音樂家亞鞱魯。托斯卡尼尼（Arturo　Toscannini），最近被義大利總統尼古拉任命爲參議員。依據意大利新憲法規定，總統可在枓學，社會學，藝術，及文學各界任命義大利名流五人爲終身參議員，托氏的新任命，實在是藝術界一大盛事。</p>
<p>托斯卡尼尼於一八六七年三月廿五，出生於富有音樂氣氛的義大利巴馬（Parma）城，父親是個裁縫，母親也不是一個音樂家，可是托氏卻富有音樂天才，九歲起就讀於當地音樂院，學習大提琴，十八歲畢業時，獲得榮譽獎狀。以後，他便參加了各小樂隊演奏。</p>
<p>托氏對於歌曲的記憶力特別的强。這一點，加上他的勤力，就是造成他以後成就的主要因素。有一次，當歌劇「阿依達」上演的幾小時前，樂隊指揮突然和經理鬧意見，拒絕出席指揮。那時經理接受了一個樂隊隊員的建議，請托斯卡尼尼擔任臨時指揮。托氏的成就大受聽衆讚揚。那時，他只有十九歲。以後，托氏便扶搖直上，成為世界第一流的指揮，今天，他已被譽爲世界指揮之王了。</p>
<p>事實上，托氏不祇是對音樂造詣極高的藝術家，並且是一位有偉大人格，愛好自由，富有正義感的戰士。他痛恨法西斯黨人，對法西斯黨人的威迫利誘，毫不動心。他們曾數度强迫他指揮演奏法西斯黨歌，他毅然拒絕了，並且，還因此受過毆打。可是，這只有加强他反法西斯的決心。</p>
<p>一九三八年，整個義大利都在法西斯的魔掌中了，托斯卡尼尼再也不能在祖國的土地裏逗留下去，爲了祖國的將來，爲了藝術，托氏含淚再度赴美國工作了。托氏不只把崇高的歐洲音樂帶到美國去，並且還把千千萬萬義大利同胞們爲正義，自由而戰的決心帶到了那自由之邦去，引起了全美國民衆的共鳴。足跡所至，大受熱烈的歡迎。當音樂會或歌劇院的指揮台上，站着這位銀髮藝人，指揮着演奏音樂的時候，台下的聽衆，他指揮的樂隊和合唱隊都一致感到是無上榮幸的</p>
<p>聯合國機構成立後，美國國務院爲了作盛大的宣傳，便前托斯卡尼尼協助。拍一張音樂短片——「聯合國歌」。托氏將聯合國歌改編成一首動人的歌曲，由托氏指揮奏唱，擔任合唱的是美國各地合唱團的精銳，管絃樂隊也是集各樂隊的優秀分子合組而成。壯麗的音樂，動人的歌聲，給千十萬萬人一個不消能逝的深刻印　。</p>
<p>這高齡業已八十的老藝人，眞是老當益壯。去年五月，托氏特應邀返國義務表演，募捐救濟難胞；之後又帶了樂隊赴倫敦演奏，傾動了整個英國。托氏現在還擔任美國國家廣播公司（NBC）交響樂隊的首席指揮，他還在繼續不斷的努力硏究音樂。</p>
<h3>論「英雄」東條</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>一部份的外報記者以及日本人，對於這次東條在東京國際戰犯法廳上侃侃爲日皇並日本　武主義者辯護，並「坦然」承認也「個人」願負日本戰敗的責任，旦否認日是本戰爭的挑動者，都表示十分驚異，甚至敬佩；據東京方面的報導說，過去兩年中日人厭惡東條的心理，現在業已一變，他們認爲東條雖然是一個失敗者，終不失爲是一個「英雄」，至少不失爲是一個「好漢」。</p>
<p>想不到在日本投降已兩年有餘而正式和約猶未成立的今日，東條竟再度成爲一部份日人心目中的英雄或好漢了。而足够諷刺的是，今日被東條利用作爲造成他「英雄」背景的國際法庭所在地，卻正就是三年前東條坐鎭指揮「大東亞聖戰」的「帝國大本營」所在地！</p>
<p>希特勒至今生死猶謎，而墨索利尼在一度被死黨刦屍之後，現在早已被義國當局秘密埋葬了。東條在過去日本的地位，也許比不上希特勒與墨索利尼，但較之早被紐侖堡國際戰犯法庭處死的戈林和李本特洛甫等人來，他畢竟幸運得多了，因爲他不僅至今未死，且還正在利用業握着他最後命運的國際法庭，預備重溫一下他的「英雄」夢。</p>
<p>然而東條當眞算得上是一條「英雄好漢」嗎？以成敗論英雄，也許爲智者所不取；譬如像拿破侖這樣的人物，就是個人主義社會巾的一個失敗英雄的典型，因爲他的野心雖遭失敗，但從歷史家和傳記家對他所予的評價中，總還能令人喚起幾分惋惜的心情。</p>
<p>可是東條卻決不是這種脚色。且不說東條在日本投降之初會因畏罪而企圖用手槍自殺過，就是看着他今天在東京法庭上猶在中指上戴着一隻錢戒，也足以顯出他是怎樣的一種「英雄」了。據東條自稱，他所以戴那隻綫戒（實際上就是用一條綫圈套此手指上），是因爲他容易發脾氣，但祇要看到那隻錢戒，就可以抑止住自己。考其心理，恰和我們常見到小店員或娘姨們在手指上套一個橡皮圈，用以表示戒賭或戒打花會的心理差不多！</p>
<p>不過這些還是小事。其實，就日本民族的性格和他的歷史背景看，日本絕不是一個輕易能產生真正英雄人物的國家。這不是說日本缺少勇敢和　得權術（英雄所必備的若干條件）的人物；此類人物日本歷史上有的是，而是因爲日本人通常缺少浪漫的感情和遠大的憧憬。日本人可以成爲世界上最　適應環境的一種人民，但却決不是英雄的理想溫牀。而東條之類則更談業休談！</p>
<p>明治維新後的日本會一度想學歐美，可是日本的民族與社會有其自己的界限，所以終於踫了壁；接着便有所謂「昭和維新」，那時的「模範」便是德義的法西斯主義；實在說，「昭和維新」較之「明治維新」，其內容更適於日本民族的性格，不過，這也在原子時代的巨輪下被摧毀</p>
<p>現在的日本自然是在　　美國，而說模傲更不如說是奉承；因為模仿，所以一切顯得不自然，因為奉承，所以一切都含有作用。而這二而一的特性，正就是近代日本文化與其政治的骨子。一個擅於模仿奉承以求適應環境的民族，是局不能產生富有幻想創造性格的英雄的，反之，它倒是　契亞維利主義者與投機份子的　生環域。</p>
<p>東條之在東京國際法庭上的「雄辯」，以及把這樣一個善於做作的東條視為「英雄」的日本人，都不外表現了日本民族的投機性而已！日本民族自亦有其長處與優點，但可惜迄今猶浸潤在投機取巧的迷夢中。佐藤春夫筆下默認過的兩重性格的日本人，仍舊形成着今日日本文化與社會的主流。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　如此良宵　（三二）</p>
<p>綺紈等渚齋一杯酒喝完，才微微一嘆道：「我是富於感情，可是自有生以來，從沒把我的心事，對人表示過。自見你後，我的感覺，就覺比任何人不同，那晚我在什刹海被迫，決意自盡，意外地被你救護回來，不鄙薄我，又能體諒我的苦處，我覺得我一生知己，祇有你一人了。我上次在公園曾和你談過，葉落歸根，一個人總該有個歸宿，像我這樣飄飄蕩蕩，好似落葉在空中亂舞，墜溷墜茵，還說不定，以我現在環境，很有人追逐我，想和我接近，可是地們心理，我知道很明白，都不是眞心愛我，他們是抱着消遺和取樂主義，所以我對他們也祇表面敷衍。我今年雖然才祇二十二歲，這幾年來在外面奔走，接觸的人很多，我把各人的心理，細細硏究，能了解我的苦心，祗有你一人。」渚齋聽到道裹，非常感動，說道：」我是最佩服你的藝術的，你受種種磨折，始終能爲藝術奮鬥，這一點最堪欽佩。」綺紈道：「別說什麼欽佩，我總覺你是我唯一知心人，知己最爲難得，所以我不把擬當外人看待，也無話不談，丙爲我心直口快，剛才忽然談到你的婚姻問題，但是業已成爲事實，也就無須後悔。不要爲我一句話，引起你的不快」。渚齋見綺紈婉轉說了許多話，竟是要解釋所談婚姻問題，大概她看出種種困難，所以語意間由熱烈而轉爲平淡，這是她多心了，因忙道：「是你看得起我，才談到道問題，也是使我最難過的問題，我對這事，苦痛極了！」綺紈見渚齋說時，緊蹙眉頭，知道他心裏難過，說道：「現在且不談這事，我們再喝兩杯吧！」因先把面前的一杯酒喝乾。渚齋也陪了一杯，搖搖頭道：「我自結婚後，就沒有一天痛快的，現在更不用說了，就說今天恰是我的生日，在別人一定要回去和家裏聚會，我不是爲你要走，我寗願在外面，孤孤單單過我的生日，不會回來。」綺紈微微一怔道：「今天是你的生日呀！那末，我匆匆備了幾碗粗菜，本來想作你我的離筵，不想竟爲你祝壽了，好，應該敬你三杯！」因站來帶起酒杯讓渚齋喝，渚齋伸手在她肩上，輕輕一按道：「你且請坐！呌我喝幾杯沒問題，祗是你已經喝了不少，勸你不要再喝，嗓音要緊！」綺紈仍舉杯立着說：「沒關係，你喝了我還有話對你說。」渚　祗好也起立，就她手中，把酒喝乾，綺紈也陪了三杯，拉他坐下，把自己貼身衣領上，一隻鑲珠別針取下，親手別在渚齋領帶上，微微笑道，「今天是你生日，我送你這個，留做紀念吧！」</p>
<h3>新年頌</h3>
<h3>孫約翰</h3>
<p>新年好，新年好，善薩座前先跪倒。萬物價從八木騰，新年人比舊年老！未靖烽烟莫斷腸，世事如此管他娘。眼前但見私　飽，卯歲已空寅歲糧。最是東鄰王小二，單帮獨覓蠅頭利。過年年復不如年，夫妻對灑牛衣淚！桃源起築債台高，臘尾寒風似剪刀。豈讓豪門違節約？肯隨權貴學時髦？柴米油鹽殊棘手，形容累似喪家狗。生涯蘿蔔敲金鑼，職司駝子翻觔斗！吁嗟乎，時難年荒我亦荒，賣文鬻畫倍郞當。夢中擁被狂歡喊：拾得人間辟殺方！（註：「八木」，米也。「蘿蔔敲金鑼」，一段短一段。「駝子翻觔斗」，兩頭勿着實。）</p>
<h3>抄襲</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>一件抄襲案無聲無臭地（這是說與筱丹桂案相形之下）解決了，我現在所記在下面的，却是一件更其無關緊要的瑣事。偶然與一位坐冷板凳的談起抄襲，承他吿訴我道件課室以內的文抄公的趣事，不記下來頗爲可惜。</p>
<p>有一次我的朋友在作文簿上看到一篇很好的文章，甚爲得意，在敎員休息室中給同事們傳觀。輪到一位別級的國文敎師，他！於是也在敎本上左　右　，果然翻出了「原稿」，有眼不識泰山，它卻是五四時代一位白話文戰士的文章。我的朋友大爲快活，好像人家帮他捉住了扒　一般的感覺，立即把那學生喊了來。變，卻同樣詫異地說道：一怎麼它和我寫的一樣的？」怎麼會一樣的？他偏要相信（或者不如說主張）天下是有這等巧事，爭到了這信仰問題的時候，便再說業說不清了。</p>
<p>我的朋友告訴我，其中不是沒有緣故的。有一次這學生吵到訓育處，說體育敎師打他耳括子，體育教師卻不承認。可是學生的臉上紅得幾乎看得出「巨靈之掌」。體育教師解釋道：「我的手剛這麼揮出去，他的臉剛這麼掉過來，雙方自然不免這麼碰了一下。一天下竟有「這麼」的巧事，訓育主任當然與教師抱着同樣堅決的信仰，學生不能不嘿爾而退。這一場教訓對於他不是沒有益處，上文便是第一次起作用了。</p>
<h3>東郊民巷總結帳</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>東交民巷之地　房產，已於年前由中外負責當局，正式簽空交代，中國方面北平市長，外交特派員，外國方面五顧問，即美英法比荷五領事，地點在市府西花廳，時則中華民國三十六年十二月二十六日之下午三點鐘。歷史意義頗爲重大，允宜特筆書之。</p>
<p>事實上，四年前，東交民巷所謂「使館界」已不存在。光復後，我國雖已接收，但完成手續，淸結以前之一切，則自此日此時始。</p>
<p>正陽門內以東，直至崇文門之西，北至長安街，南爲城坦，畏方的一個區域，庚子以前原是中外官民雜居，外國使館及僑商雖多，中國官署及大老住宅亦不少。四朝元老大學士徐桐（時稱蔭軒相國，淸同治帝之師傅）之相府，即在區內。他是理學家，素日深惑洋人，而所居與使館密接，因書門對「認洋興嘆」，「與鬼爲隣」八字。大門外，有土堆一座如小山，係多年的風沙與垃圾造成，迷信家說是貴宅的風水，大吉大利。洋人則以其礙交通，妨衛生，動工毀平，徐桐莫如之何，恨洋人益甚。庚子紀變雜詠，所謂「當朝老道住洋塲，愛惜門前土一方」，即指此事。徐氏服膺程朱，道貌岸然，士林號爲「徐老道」，因力贊義和拳，故八國聯軍破北京，即縣樑自盡，年逾八十矣。</p>
<p>庚子亂後，淸政府允將官衙民宅全部遷移界外，此一方國土，遂由各使設局自行管理。上有輪班之値年，公使下有自辦之巡捕及郵局。其初，且以保護道路爲理由，不許華人通行，後經淸外交部與之交涉，每年津貼修路費五千兩，纔得「通過權」，但大車轎車仍受限制，一遇變故，先斷絕交通。辛亥武昌起義後，北京市面慌亂，交民巷首戒嚴，東西北三面封鎖數月之久，此後如復辟之戰，直皖之戰，兩次直皖之戰，以及其他騷動，交民巷立即關閉鐵柵，自行保守。其園墻有砲台垜口，宛然雉堞，氣象森嚴，市人稱爲「外國紫禁城」，比「中國紫禁城」（故宮）海威勢。</p>
<p>因爲幾次軍閥內亂，烽火及於城市，市民驚弓之為，一聞警訊，紛紛向交民巷臨時租房避禍。但外人則以此乃Legaton　Quarter與天津之Concession不同，限制極　且洋行洋宅林立，除六國飯店及其餘幾個飯店醫院，早爲捷足先登外，只可轉托西崽之類設法，雖一永屋一柴棚亦可得重價。其時各洋行又利用保險箱，按號出租，可以寄放貴重財物，故一遇亂事，則交民巷財源滾滾，市人明知花錢受氣，亦不得不然。且此惟商人能辦，平民尙望塵莫及。</p>
<p>自崇文門內以東至東城墻北至東單牌樓，此區域俗呼「保衛界」，文名「第二東交民巷」旣非租界，亦非使館界，雖在中國警權之下，而外國住宅，洋行，醫院，報館，飯店，妓院，各國人散居各巷，因之洋氣十足。且因此區在使館界之東，僻在一隅，故雖城郊有兵事，亦有「洋紫禁城」爲之屛幛，住戶可以「高枕無憂」。此區之房宅地皮價目比他處　　區更貴四五倍，出售或出租之廣吿，特別標出「保衛界內」字樣，以爲索取重價之理由。亂時找房者，房主之居奇勒索，與租界無異。是怪現象，亦是傷心史，而今都成陳迹了。</p>
<p>在經濟上，自從前淸之鐵路國有大借款，民國之善後大借款，以及各宗大小借款，莫不以使館界之「銀行團」爲中心。英之匯豐，法之匯理，日之正金，皆於中國金融界佔絕大勢力，那些大樓，亦都巍然高聳在東交民巷裏。</p>
<p>在政治上，又有「外交團」的名詞，北政府時代有「太上政府」之號。每次政變的失敗者，如復辟之張勳，則藏在荷蘭使館，「安福」之十罪魁梁鴻志，徐樹錚，朱深等都在日本兵營的地窖裏躲避經年，於是此區又為逋逃　。</p>
<p>「七七」事變後之兩三年，日人對使館界尙略有顧忌，至太平洋戰起之前一年，漸向英美挑　，迄於開戰，遂以其軍隊佔領英美兩館，而其他各國館員亦悚息於惡燄之下者又年餘，復以交還之形式，付之僞華北政委會，實際仍由日方控制。</p>
<p>現在規定爲地政局所轄市產之一部，（界內各國以公務上之目的，准其繼續使用之土地，則有新約）於是五十年象徽「不平等」之特殊區械，復爲中華之「乾凈土」，其意義比收回租界尤爲重大，乃稍具歷史知識者所能知也。</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union's Attitude Towards the Japanese Peace Treaty Remains to Advocate a Special Foreign Ministers' Conference; Molotov Replies to China's Suggestion; CCP Representatives Go to Khabarovsk to Attend Soviet Military Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 4th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated in a note to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang on the 30th of last month: "Only the Foreign Ministers' Conference has the authority to prepare the Japanese Peace Treaty." Mr. Molotov suggested that other member states of the Far Eastern Commission could participate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference, following the precedent of the work on the German Peace Treaty, and the work of possible committees and subcommittees, as well as meetings regarding information consultation. The aforementioned note was in response to Minister Wang's note of the 5th of last month. According to China's note, it was pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission should undertake the main work of the Japanese Peace Treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] Moscow Radio broadcast widely today stating: The Soviet Union has separately notified the United States, Britain, and China, reiterating its suggestion to convene a special four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference this month to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty. The 1945 Potsdam Conference clearly stipulated that the four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has the authority to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty. The Soviet government, in view of China's opinion on the Potsdam Agreement, believes that a supplementary statement is necessary. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the Foreign Ministers' Conference for drafting the peace treaty should be organized by representatives dispatched by the member states that signed the instrument of surrender with the relevant enemy country. Accordingly, although China did not participate in drafting peace treaties with former enemy countries in Europe, it should be on the list of invitees this time. However, the Chinese government's claim that the Far Eastern Commission's authority has a direct relationship with the Japanese Peace Conference cannot be considered sufficiently justified in light of the Moscow Agreement of December 1945. According to the Moscow Agreement, the preparation work for the Japanese Peace Treaty should be handled by the four-nation Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. Therefore, the four countries signed the instrument of surrender in Japan, and these countries' special concern for post-war Japan issues was recognized by the Moscow Agreement of December 1945. As for other countries of the Far Eastern Commission, they can participate in special committees and subcommittees. This method is sufficient to ensure that the interests of these countries will not be ignored.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Shenyang cabled today stating: Northeast CCP leaders Lin Biao and Li Lisan have flown to Khabarovsk to attend a conference initiated by the Soviet Far East Command to discuss the exchange of daily necessities and Soviet weapons and ammunition seized by the Communists in the winter offensive. According to this, a military spokesperson declared: Although the authorities have not received this report, the Communists will not hesitate to take any steps to achieve their goals, even selling the Northeast to foreign countries. It is heard that Li Lisan's mission has three points: Exchanging daily necessities seized by the Communists in the winter offensive for Soviet weapons and ammunition, and requesting the Soviet Union to provide the Communist side with unlimited supplies of various military needs in the future. Obtaining Soviet equipment to organize a mechanized army. Proposing a spring offensive plan, with the ultimate goal of occupying the entire Northeast.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong Criticizes the United States; Reports on the CCP's Ten Operational Plans</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 1st] CCP leader Mao Zedong submitted a report of 10,000 words to the Central Executive Committee of the party on December 25th. The CCP radio station broadcast the first part today, and the remaining parts will be broadcast continuously within three days. He stated: The United States is guiding the counter-revolutionary war "to deal with the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people." The CCP army is adopting a full-scale offensive, which "will surely make the hundreds of millions of people oppressed by imperialism in the Eastern Hemisphere rejoice and be encouraged, and will also be a kind of support for the oppressed nations in some countries in Europe and the Americas." Mao also reported on the CCP army's ten operational plans, the content of which focuses on concentrating forces, breaking through key points, avoiding occupying any large cities, and waiting for the future. The CCP radio station broadcast the second part of the report submitted by Mao Zedong on the 2nd, stating: The CCP is carrying out party purification, eliminating unstable elements in key positions. These unstable elements mixed in when the number of Communist Party members expanded to 2.7 million between 1937 and 1947, including landlords and hired peasants, who controlled rural areas, party and government organs, and public bodies, oppressed the people, distorted party policies, causing these organs and public bodies to become detached from the people, and making it impossible to implement rural reform plans. Red Army soldiers also need to be reorganized and purified.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 3rd] According to Mao Zedong's New Year's address intercepted here on the evening of the 3rd (broadcast on the Shanbei radio station), he criticized the United States for preparing for war and planning to launch a third world war in the near future to defeat democratic forces.

<h3>Canadian Munitions Set Sail for China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vancouver, 3rd] Munitions worth 2.2 million US dollars set sail for China on the 3rd on the 5,000-ton Canadian ship Okanagan. Previously, the Canadian Seafarers' Union believed that carrying these goods was a danger to life or disability and requested life insurance for the crew of the ship and a guarantee to bear medical expenses, which caused a dispute with the shipping company and the Federal Labor Bureau, delaying the departure. This matter has now been resolved, and it is expected that another six ships will also be able to ship all of the military equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars ordered by China from Canada to China.</p>

<p>To Overcome Current Financial Difficulties, Strict Price Controls Are Necessary; Minister of Finance Yu Reports to the Senate Standing Committee</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The national budget for the 36th year has a huge gap between income and expenditure. The total amount of expenditure is more than 930 billion yuan, which is four and a half times the original budget. The total amount of revenue is about 130 billion yuan (the original budget was more than 70.3 billion). Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun attended the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee today and reported on recent financial measures. He emphasized that to overcome current financial difficulties, it is necessary to strictly control prices, increase sources of income, and increase national treasury revenue. He also pointed out that the reason why the budget cannot be balanced is because the Communists destroyed transportation, blocked freight, and hindered production, which caused price fluctuations and currency inflation, which cannot be stopped immediately. Moreover, the military needs during the chaos are huge, and the salaries of civil servants have been adjusted repeatedly, which has increased expenditures. Therefore, the increase in various taxes is far less than the rapid rise in prices. He also stated that in the total revenue of the 36th year, tax revenue was more than 90 billion yuan, accounting for 68% of the total revenue. In addition to tax revenue, the revenue was more than 28 billion, and the public debt revenue was more than 13 billion. (Continued on page 2, left corner)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th] Because the business operations of credit cooperatives are similar to those of banks recently, and credit cooperatives only need to register with the Ministry of Social Affairs to be established, the procedures are so simple that their operations are inevitably suspected of speculation and hoarding.

<h3>Congratulating the Birth of the Republic of Burma, Hoping for a New Beginning in Sino-Burmese Relations</h3>
<p>Burma officially declared its independence on the fourth of this month. The free Republic of Burma was born on this auspicious occasion. China and Burma are closely connected geographically and have always been brotherly nations. As Burma achieves independence, our country, in addition to sending Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao as a special envoy to offer congratulations, leaders of the government, including Chairman Chiang, have sent telegrams to the President, Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister of Burma to express their congratulations. This newspaper has always sympathized with and valued the Burmese people's struggle for independence and freedom, and is particularly concerned about the future Sino-Burmese relations. Today, Burma has achieved independence and reaped abundant fruits. We extend our most sincere congratulations and express our boundless joy for the rebuilding of Sino-Burmese relations. 1948 is a happy year for Southeast Asia. We firmly believe that in the future, China and Burma will live in good neighborliness and continue to unite strongly, dedicating themselves to the reconstruction of Asia and working together to seek the happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>Burma is located in the western part of the Indochinese Peninsula, bordering the Bay of Bengal to the southwest. The entire territory is divided into Upper Burma and Lower Burma: Upper Burma connects to Yunnan and Xikang in China, facing the northeast of the country; Lower Burma borders Siam to the east and India to the west. The mountains are purely the remaining veins of China's Hengduan Mountains; the Irrawaddy River originates purely from the highlands of Kangzang. Burma's mountains are the remaining veins of China, and Burma's waters are tributaries of China. The friendly relations between Burma and China in history, if not predetermined by fate, how could the soil be so connected, the terrain so similar, and the bloodlines so flowing, with such intimacy! The songs of China, when heard by the Burmese, are pleasing and touching. Burmese customs are close to those of the Chinese, like the clothing of brothers. Every time we browse Burmese and Chinese books, we feel a longing and lingering emotions for the ancient stupa of Shwemawdaw Pagoda, the great Shwedagon Pagoda of Yangon, the reclining Buddha of Thanlyin, the wide port of Pathein, as well as the old site of Bago and the hot springs of Dawei. The geographical features, culture, customs, and so on of China and Burma are so closely related and similar, which is by no means an accidental formation, but a demonstration of the intertwined fates and shared concerns of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Sino-Burmese relations have a glorious history of three thousand years, which is evident in historical records. General Sino-Burmese historical books and illustrated records not only contain glorious records, but also magnificent songs, leaping onto the paper. According to historical texts and evaluations, Sino-Burmese relations began in the ninth year of Yongyuan in the Later Han Dynasty (97 AD) and were interrupted in the twelfth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1886 AD), a total of 1,789 years. What preceded this is unverifiable, and what followed belonged to the relations between China and Britain. The most unfortunate thing is that the Sino-British negotiations on the dispute over the Yunnan-Burma border still have an undetermined section, which has become a pending issue. Although Sino-Burmese relations were interrupted for sixty years, the joint fight against Japan by China and Burma during these sixty years can be regarded as the prelude to the revival of direct Sino-Burmese relations. During the war, the wartime capital of our country, Chongqing, was visited by a Burmese delegation, which brought profound friendship. Subsequently, with the establishment of the Sino-Burmese Cultural Association, the national diplomatic activities of the two countries have never been interrupted and have increased daily. These facts show that Sino-Burmese relations have become deeper due to the long history of the past and the joint fight against Japan. This time, after the Anglo-Burmese agreement was signed, the two governments simultaneously exchanged ambassadors, symbolizing the rebuilding of Sino-Burmese relations, which has a history of friendly love and far-reaching origins. We are very pleased that the direct Sino-Burmese relations, which had been interrupted for sixty-one years, have been re-established. Today, Burma has completed its great cause of independence, and our joy is the same as that of the Burmese people. We are even more convinced of the consolidation of Sino-Burmese relations in the future.</p>
<p>The unresolved Yunnan-Burma border issue in the history of Sino-British negotiations is the misfortune of Sino-British historical relations. We do not want this unfortunate border dispute to continue to constitute unhappiness between China and Burma. Therefore, we hope that when Sino-British relations are harmonious, Britain should voluntarily retreat from the occupied areas on the Yunnan border to eliminate the old evils in history. We especially hope that on the day the Sino-Burmese border line is demarcated, the Hukawng Valley, where Chinese troops shed blood, and the Jiangxinpo, which was invaded in the past, will no longer be included in the Burmese territory. We believe that the enlightened British government and the wise leaders of Burma will surely remember the glorious achievements of our Expeditionary Force in Burma during this war, which will be recorded in history. The Battle of Saokji, the Battle of Toungoo, and the Battle of Yenangyaung were fought to cover the retreat of the British army, and our Expeditionary Force was besieged, and Division Commander Dai Anlan died as a result. Two years later, our army launched an attack from India again, re-entering Burma, and defeated the stubborn Japanese invaders in the Hukawng Valley and the Mogaung Valley, opening up the China-India Highway and restoring half of Burma's territory. The mountains and rivers stained with the blood of Chinese men contributed to the noble friendship between China and Britain and between China and Burma. The reason why we recall this is not to demand any rewards, but only to hope that the Chinese border areas invaded by the British army in the past should be returned to China in accordance with the law and facts, so as to determine the natural boundaries of our southwestern frontier. British politicians, especially the enlightened leaders of the Labour government, have foresight and achievements, and are expected to break with tradition and create new ways for the new Sino-British relations after the war. The new Burmese nation is not short of far-sighted people. When Burma is established and reborn, we are even more convinced that rational and ambitious Burmese politicians will surely repay their good neighbors with joy.</p>
<p>We celebrate the independence of Burma and the birth of the Republic of Burma, and hope that the Sino-Burmese relations, which have been interrupted for sixty-one years, will have a new beginning and a new creation from the auspicious day of yesterday (the 4th), paving the way for peace and happiness in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>President Zhang's Broadcast</p>
<p>President Zhang broadcast to the nation on New Year's Day, entitled "The Military and the People Cooperate with One Heart to Complete the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction." At 8:00 PM in the evening, President Zhang also gave a broadcast speech entitled "National Politics and National Undertakings": Fully assist in suppressing the rebellion and restore the unity and stability of the country.

<p>President Yu's Broadcast</p>
<p>President Yu broadcast to officers and soldiers across the country on New Year's Day on the military radio station, entitled "This Year is the Year of Success in Constitutional Rule and Suppression of Rebellion." He encouraged the soldiers and civilians across the country to raise their vigilance, work hard together, and strive together to achieve the historical mission of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

<p>Hu Shih's Thoughts</p>
<p>In addition, Hu Shih, President of Peking University, after recovering from a minor illness, expressed his feelings about the implementation of the Constitution. He emphasized that this Constitution is more sound than past charters, constitutions, and interim laws, but he believes that there are various difficulties in the implementation of certain articles in this law. Government personnel at all levels must study the Constitution in detail and immediately make all preparations for its implementation in order to overcome the difficulties. He went on to say: Some of the absolute provisions in the Constitution are a progressive fundamental law. Hu Shih also praised the progress of the provisions on the rights and obligations of the people in the second chapter of the Constitution. He believes that the provisions of Article 8, "1. The court shall not refuse the people's request for habeas corpus; 2. It is not allowed to request the arresting agency to explain and answer first; 3. The arresting agency shall not refuse or delay the habeas corpus; 4. Violation of the above three points is a crime" and Article 172 stipulates that "Orders that conflict with the Constitution or laws are invalid" are important features. He said: The government and the people should study and understand the various provisions in detail. The government should ask the National Assembly to make a limited-term reservation for the points that are difficult to implement, and the people must know the contents of the Constitution in order to obtain their due rights and fulfill their obligations. Hu Shih repeatedly emphasized: The government must have 100% patience in the implementation of the Constitution. Hu Shih also talked about other issues, such as the president's rights, the powers of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, the ideals of the chapter on basic national policies, compulsory education for school-age children, and 15% of the total budget for education expenditures. His conclusion said: Although some provisions cannot be implemented immediately due to the limitations of material time and the government's preparations, they can all be achieved. At the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, at the time of the New Year's renewal, it is hoped that the whole country will thoroughly implement it.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong's Report</h3>
<p>(Continued from the first page) Mao Zedong said: American imperialism is now establishing a plan to enslave the world, and it is jumping into various parts of Europe and Asia like a beast, organizing the reactionary forces of various countries into an imperialist anti-democratic front to attack all democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>He also said: The democratic forces of the whole world must defeat this plan, and they will surely be able to defeat this plan. The strength of the world anti-imperialist camp has now exceeded the strength of the imperialist camp. The advantage is on our side, not on the enemy's side. The anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been formed. The socialist Soviet Union is rising, and there is no economic panic. It is also supported by the vast masses of the world, so its strength has exceeded that of the imperialist United States, because the United States is declining, and it is seriously threatened by economic panic, and it is opposed by the vast masses of the world. The new democratic countries in Europe have strengthened their unity at home and established contact with each other abroad. The anti-imperialist forces of the people in the capitalist countries in Europe, led by France and Italy, are now growing. The people of Latin America are no longer entirely obedient slaves of the United States. The entire Asia has risen with national liberation movements. The communist parties of nine European countries have issued a declaration calling on the people of the world to join the battle and rise up to resist imperialism. This call to battle has inspired the oppressed people of the world, pointed out the direction of struggle for them, and strengthened their confidence in victory.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong's broadcast clearly told the world that once the party's basic program is realized, the CCP intends to establish a "firm leadership" of the united front to govern China. The CCP is now following its political line of "developing progressive forces, overcoming intermediate forces, and isolating diehards." He asked in an eloquent tone: "Can the United States really continuously provide a large amount of assistance to the reactionary parties in various countries? No. Although the economic strength of American imperialism has increased during World War II, it is now facing instability and reduction in domestic and foreign markets. If it is reduced again, it will cause an economic panic to break out. The wartime prosperity of the United States is only a temporary phenomenon. The strength of the United States is only artificial. Once an economic panic breaks out, it will be like a volcano threatening the American imperialism that is now sitting on a volcano."</p>
<p>His conclusion was to denounce pessimism, saying: "We must eliminate all weak and incompetent ideas in our camp. All views that overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate the people's strength are wrong. We should firmly believe that there are many difficulties and obstacles ahead. If we can grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, we will surely be able to overcome the difficulties and defeat the enemy."</p>
<p>He said: Capitalism is heading for extinction, and socialism and democracy are heading for victory.</p>
<p>He simulated the sentence of British wartime Prime Minister Churchill to end his lengthy 10,000-word report: "The light of dawn is already in front of us, and we should strive forward."</p>
<h3>Li Jishen Leads Reactionary Organization in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] Nationalist Party traitors led by Li Jishen announced on the 3rd the establishment of the "Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party." They have been meeting in Hong Kong for two weeks, and now they have published a lengthy declaration, signed by Feng Yuxiang (now in the United States), Cai Tingkai, He Xiangning, Tan Pingshan, Liu Yazi, etc. (all of the above are in Hong Kong).</p>
<p>This harshly worded declaration recounts the history of the party since Sun Yat-sen founded it in 1924, and then criticizes it, saying: Twenty years have passed, and Sun Yat-sen's will has not yet been realized. The declaration calls for the implementation of Sun's Three Principles of the People, but in view of the changes in the past twenty years, it is also necessary to make some revisions:</p>
<p>"We must unite with nations that treat us equally" should add "Unite with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>"The Chinese democratic parties unite" includes: the Communist Party and the Democratic League.</p>
<p>"Tillers have their mountains, and workers have work to do."</p>
<p>The declaration also calls for "anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism." It is said that this is inseparable from the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, because "American reactionaries intend to destroy China."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 2nd] Save the Country Association leader Shen Junru and Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Party leader Zhang Bojun today jointly issued a notice calling for the Chinese Democratic League to hold its third plenary meeting in Hong Kong on the 5th of this month. By then, except for Chairman Zhang Lan and Luo Longji, the remaining representatives are said to be prepared to attend. The meeting will be secret, but a declaration will be issued at the closing ceremony.</p>

<h3>Grain Prices Rise Everywhere, Wuxi Arrests Speculating Merchants</h3>

<h3>Minister of Finance Yu's Report at the Conference</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Mr. Yu continued his report on the actual situation of the four major pillars of national tax revenue: customs duties, salt tax, direct tax, and commodity tax, stating:</p>
<p>Last year's customs revenue was over 2.2 trillion; exceeding the original budget by more than 300 billion. However, under the current import trade management, due to strict restrictions on certain imported goods, while encouraging exports and striving for foreign exchange, and granting tax-free exports for certain goods, the tax base is not easily prosperous. Furthermore, the smuggling problem is extremely serious, with over 18,000 smuggling cases and confiscated smuggled goods amounting to over 155 billion yuan. We are currently negotiating with the Hong Kong government to draft an assistance agreement for combating smuggling, which should be signed soon.</p>
<p>The total budgeted salt tax revenue was over 530 billion, but as of mid-December, over 1 trillion has already been collected. 200,000 tons of salt were shipped to Japan in exchange for domestically produced equipment. Although the salt tax rate was adjusted twice last year, the current tax rate is only 50% of the pre-war level.</p>
<p>Direct tax revenue, originally budgeted at over 940 billion, will exceed this figure by the end of the year. Mr. Yu also reported that the Ministry of Finance has already drafted a plan regarding the levy of property tax, which will be implemented upon approval by the State Council.</p>
<p>Commodity tax revenue, originally budgeted at over 1.8 trillion, has actually reached over 3.7 trillion. However, the commodity tax is levied ad valorem, and its implementation is not thorough. If the tax amount is too high, it will hinder production, and if it is too low, it will affect tax revenue. In the future, we should strive to balance both. Mr. Yu continued to emphasize the extreme importance of reorganizing the tax system. In recent years, we have strived to improve the tax system and reduce the size of the organization. In the 36th year, over 7,000 tax personnel were dismissed, and a strict examination system was implemented to raise the standard of talent. He also stated: I cannot guarantee that tax personnel will not be corrupt, and those found will be punished. Last year, 257 people were dismissed for corruption, 68 were dismissed, 59 were suspended, and 7 were wanted. He continued to point out that many tax personnel are also able to work diligently and selflessly. Mr. Yu then described the revenue other than taxes, such as the situation of public debt revenue and material revenue, stating: The sales of US dollar short-term treasury bills and US dollar bonds were not satisfactory last year, due to high prices and the fact that bond interest was not as good as market profits. Regarding local finances, the total expenditure of provinces and cities throughout the year was over 2.6 trillion, with over 2.1 trillion subsidized by the central government. Temporary expenditures in various regions have increased sharply due to the war with the communist bandits. Mr. Yu continued to report on the financial facilities situation, briefly stating: In order to strengthen financial management and the control of banks and money shops, a Financial Administration Bureau has been established to be responsible for inspection and supervision, strictly crack down on financial transactions, restrict bank loans to tighten credit, and revise foreign exchange management measures to improve remittances from overseas Chinese. Last year's import and export trade had a deficit of over 427 billion, with a difference of 50% between imports and exports, but compared with 70% in the 35th year, the deficit has slightly decreased. After reviewing the major financial measures of the past year, Mr. Yu then elaborated on the work plan for the 37th year, which will focus on central and local sources of revenue and the reorganization of tax revenue, in order to increase national treasury revenue. Finally, he emphasized that in order to achieve budget balance, it is necessary to comprehensively control special prices to stabilize the currency value. The price issue is an overall economic issue and cannot be addressed piecemeal. Politics, military affairs, and economics are an integrated whole, and must be uniformly coordinated in order to jointly promote progress.</p>
<p>Improving the Treatment of Civil Servants Awaiting Implementation After Approval by the State Council</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The measures for adjusting the treatment of civil and military personnel will be implemented after being approved at the State Council meeting to be held this Friday. A certain government official told reporters on the evening of the 4th that the adjustment plan has been finalized after several discussions by the government's special review committee. The principle is to start at thirty yuan, calculated based on the cost of living index, and for those above thirty yuan, to calculate at ten percent.</p>

<h3>End of 61 Years of British Rule Birth of the Republic of Burma Solemn Ceremony to Transfer Sovereignty, Officials Including the President Sworn In</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Rangoon, 4th] Burma declared independence at 4:20 this morning (9:50 PM standard time), which was determined by astrologers to be an auspicious time, held a flag-raising ceremony, lowered the British flag, and replaced it with the three-colored star-studded flag of the Republic of Burma, thus ending 61 years of British rule in Burma. In addition to officials from the Burmese provincial government and naval and military officers from China, the United States, Britain, and Burma, representatives from India, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Siam, Indonesia, and Australia also attended the grand event.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 4th] British sovereignty in Burma ended two hours before dawn on the 4th, and the sovereignty of the Republic of Burma was born at the same time. The ceremony to transfer sovereignty was held on the lawn in front of the Parliament Building, with about 2,000 people watching. When the British and Burmese flags were raised and lowered alternately amidst the sound of bugles, the whole audience cheered, and the bells, firecrackers, and factory and ship whistles throughout the city also sounded in unison. About ten minutes later, the leaders and diplomats from various countries walked into the Parliament Building, where Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik officially took office as President and announced the implementation of the new constitution of free Burma. All parliamentary officials stood up and sang the national anthem, and observed two minutes of silence for the martyred leaders such as Aung San. Subsequently, the President officially appointed Thakin Nu as Prime Minister, and Mr. Thakin Nu led the cabinet members in taking the oath of office. After the ceremony, Mr. Thakin Nu addressed the Parliament. When the Burmese leaders and diplomats from various countries walked out of the parliament building, it was dawn. Everyone faced the dawn, silently, but everyone felt that this dawn of January 4, 1948, symbolized freedom and light for Burma.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 4th] After taking office, Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik issued the following statement to this agency, instructing it to convey it to people all over the world: "Burma, entering a new era of freedom, extends its greetings to the world. We rejoice in the birth of our country, and we feel gratified that the world shares our feelings. On the occasion of entering a period of freedom, we express our gratitude to all free countries, freedom fighters, British politicians, and all those who have helped us to successfully achieve our goals. On the day we join the international ranks, we are determined to maintain the most friendly relations with all countries and do our best to maintain world peace."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Rangoon, 4th] Burma formally became independent today, and the Constituent Assembly is now exercising the power of the Federal Parliament. The new cabinet of 18 people has been appointed, with Thakin Nu remaining as Prime Minister, Bo Let Ya remaining as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Tin Tut remaining as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Ko Nyein remaining as Minister of Internal Affairs. The whole country celebrates for three days, and British, Chinese, and Indian expatriates also join the celebration. After Burma's independence, there are many difficulties ahead, as there is still post-war chaos in various regions.</p>
<h3>Special Telegrams of Congratulations from American and British Leaders Mr. Bowker Appointed as the First British Ambassador to Burma</h3>

<h3>The Throne is Returned to Burma Sister Countries Hang Flags to Celebrate</h3>

<h3>Rumors of Stalin's Illness Swedish Cancer Expert Urgently Summoned to Fly to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 3rd] Professor Einar Biörklund, a famous Swedish cancer expert, was urgently summoned by the Soviet authorities and flew to Moscow on the 3rd to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of a most serious disease. Before his departure, the professor said that although he was urgently summoned, he still did not know who the patient was. However, according to his colleagues, the unnamed patient is Marshal Stalin. Professor Biörklund flew to Helsinki, Finland on the morning of the 3rd, where a Soviet government special plane was waiting to take Mr. Biörklund directly to Moscow.</p>
<p>According to Professor Biörklund's colleagues, Biörklund is a non-partisan figure and the director of the Radiumhemmet hospital in Stockholm, with extensive experience in cancer treatment. He has many patients in his hospital and is very busy with his diagnosis and treatment duties. If it were not for an important Soviet figure, he would not have abandoned his duties to go to Moscow. Among the important Soviet figures, only Stalin is rumored to be ill. It is expected that after Biörklund arrives in Moscow, the Soviet authorities will request him to keep the patient's identity a secret from everyone else. Another reason to prove that Biörklund's patient is Stalin himself is that the Soviet authorities did not summon Biörklund through the Soviet embassy in Sweden, but directly called Mr. Biörklund. This shows that the patient is an extremely important figure, and the Soviet Union will never want to reveal the state of his health. Even if the patient's condition has deteriorated significantly, they still need to urgently summon a Swedish expert for treatment.</p>
<h3>A Batch of US Marines Head to the Mediterranean for Service Generally Considered Another Indication of US Support for Italy and Greece</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 1st] The Navy Department announced today that a batch of Marines is scheduled to depart from Morehead City, North Carolina on the 6th and head to the Mediterranean to serve on the aircraft carrier "Midway" and three light cruisers. The "Midway" is currently docked in Naples, the cruiser "Portsmouth" is docked in Genoa, the "Providence" is currently docked in Livorno, Italy, and the "Little Rock" is docked in Piraeus, Greece. The US Mediterranean Fleet also has ten destroyers.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] Regarding the US sending Marines to the troubled Mediterranean region, diplomatic circles here believe that this is an indication of the US's intention to support the governments of Greece and Italy, which are being oppressed by the Communist Party. The Navy believes that the number of Marines going abroad should be kept a great secret, but another official statement believes that the number is sufficient to give each ship combat capability.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Criticizes the Soviet Union Communism Has Already Formed Imperialism Advocates that Europe Should be Led by the Labor Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd, United Press International] Prime Minister Attlee today supported the United States' "Cold War" against the Soviet Union. He warned that the communism that is eroding Europe has now formed imperialism. As the Prime Minister of the Labor government, he made the first frank and fierce attack on Soviet communism since the end of the war. He said that what the Communist Party is doing in Eastern Europe today has deprived Western Europe of the traditional spirit of individual freedom and democratic politics.</p>
<p>Mr. Attlee made a clear and general attack on Soviet communism, using the term "communism," during a political broadcast to the nation on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party. He said: "The history of the Soviet Union provides us with a warning, that is, political freedom and collectivism can quickly disappear and be replaced by new forms of oppression. Soviet communism follows new imperialism, and in terms of theory, economy, and strategy, it is enough to threaten the prosperity and way of life of other European countries."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] British Labor Party members believe that Prime Minister Attlee's political speech to the British people, although nominally a political broadcast within the party, its international significance far outweighs its internal significance. Attlee's open advocacy that European countries should be led by the Labor Party, entering a democratic socialism between communism and capitalism, is still unprecedented. Attlee's determination to make this kind of ideological propaganda on the day that Britain has achieved considerable economic success is intended to give his remarks more strength. French Socialist Party leader Blum also made similar remarks last November, but the result was unable to gain the support of the French Parliament. Attlee's background is significantly different from Blum's. Attlee has the support of a parliamentary majority in the country, and Britain occupies a leading position in Western European economic cooperation, which can give his remarks more strength.</p>
<h3>Italian Constitution Takes Effect US-Italian Agreement Signed</h3>

According to Rome Radio, the Quirinal Palace, where the former King of Italy lived, will be the palace of the President of the Republic.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Rome, 3rd] The US-Italian Interim Aid Agreement was signed at the Italian Foreign Ministry on the 3rd. It is expected that Italy will receive 160 million US dollars from the five billion dollars approved by the American people.</p>
<h3>New Soviet Ambassador to the US Presents Credentials Truman Emphasizes Mutual Trust</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The new Soviet Ambassador to the US, Panyushkin, said yesterday when he presented his credentials to President Truman that he believes his most important task is to strengthen political, economic, and cultural relations between the US and the Soviet Union in order to promote universal peace. In his reply, Truman assured Mr. Panyushkin that the United States shares the same sentiment, saying that the American people want to live peacefully in a stable and prosperous world. Mr. Truman stressed that in order to successfully solve the complex post-war problems of today's world, both sides need a spirit of mutual understanding and trust.</p>
<h3>President Truman Urges Congress to Act Swiftly on the European Recovery Plan Marshall to Attend Senate and State His Views</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] It is reported that President Truman, concerned that the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe may encounter delays in Congress, will emphasize the need for Congress to take swift action on the plan in his state of the union address to both houses of Congress on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Truman had originally set April 1 as the deadline for final approval of the Marshall Plan, but White House officials revealed that Truman was concerned that countries such as Britain, France, and Italy were likely to fall into the most serious economic difficulties before that date. Therefore, he again moved up this deadline. The President believes that if the European recovery plan is not finally completed before June 1, it will cause tragic consequences, and it will ultimately be necessary to propose another emergency aid plan for Europe. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin hearing opinions on the European Recovery Plan in the middle of this week, at which time Secretary of State Marshall will also emphasize the urgency of Europe's need for aid.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] Secretary of State Marshall will reply to some criticisms of the European aid plan on the 5th after completing his short trip out of town. Marshall himself will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee two days later.</p>
<h3>New Cabinet Crisis in France Schumann Uses His Resignation to Fight for the New Economic Plan Asks Congress for a Vote of Confidence for the Second Time</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 100th] French Prime Minister Schumann today presented a compromise bill to Congress to prevent inflation and used his resignation to fight for the full passage of the bill.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 100th] Some people even predict that if the Schumann government cannot quickly restore the stability of the national economy and food supply, General de Gaulle may have hope of seizing power in April.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The French government's new plan to save the franc has encountered various criticisms in Congress. Prime Minister Schumann has asked the National Assembly for a vote of confidence for the second time. The Communist Party and right-wing members have again proposed six amendments to Article 3 of the bill regarding the obligation of farmers to pay special income tax. Prime Minister Schumann then requested a vote of confidence for the second time. According to the French constitution, a vote of confidence must be voted on a full day after the government requests it. Prime Minister Schumann therefore suggested that if the government requests a vote of confidence on several points, it should be voted on the same day to save time. According to the first plan proposed by the government, the total amount of special income tax to be levied was approximately 155 billion francs. The new plan has reduced it by one-third to 125 billion francs. Observers pointed out that Prime Minister Schumann's expression of determination to stake the survival of the government on the bill shows that the Schumann government, which has been established for just five weeks, is facing another crisis, at a time when the so-called "Third Force" center-left political parties are trying to consolidate their position to resist the left and right attacks of the Communist Party and de Gaulle faction. However, the government's intention to reduce the amount of special income tax by one-third has shown the weakness of the "Third Force". This new Schumann cabinet may once again be in danger.</p>

<h3>Muslims Invade Kashmir India Complains to the United Nations Security Council Scheduled to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The Indian Dominion has filed a complaint with the United Nations regarding the "acts of aggression" committed by Pakistan in assisting those who have invaded Kashmir, requesting that the Security Council immediately stop Pakistan's assistance, and declaring that "otherwise, India will have to enter Pakistani territory and take military action against the invaders for self-defense."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Karachi, 4th] Pakistani Prime Minister Ali Khan said at a press conference yesterday that the Indian government's taking action on the so-called imaginary activities of the invaders in Pakistani territory would be an unprovoked act of aggression against Pakistan. He hoped that Nehru and his government would not take such action, but Pakistan is ready to cope with any eventuality.</p>

He replied in a sharp tone that Japan has its own characteristics in political ideology and methods, and never intended to imitate Nazi Germany. He admitted that the war in China, in which Japan was bogged down, was the biggest burden Japan suffered, and that Japan had to make major changes in its national policy in 1948.</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Recommends Measures to Suppress Rice Prices Surprise Raids on Granaries and Expansion of Emergency Rice Distribution</h3>
<p>The Economic Division of the Municipal Police Bureau has drafted several specific measures to effectively suppress rice prices and has recommended them to the authorities for implementation. The main points of the measures are: Implement a proportional price limit system. The price limits in the past were too rigid and difficult to be effective. The proportional price limit system will allow for flexible adjustments depending on the actual situation, so that economic police have a basis for enforcement. Several locations in the suburbs have now formed small-scale markets. If there are no plans to establish suburban rice markets, they should be strictly banned. However, the return of rice to the city should be facilitated. According to investigations, there is still plenty of rice in the city. Drastic fluctuations in rice prices and hoarding are also important reasons. It is planned that economic police will conduct surprise inspections of various granaries and reward informants. Expand the emergency distribution of rice to civilians.</p>

<h3>Customs Employees End "Hunger Strike"; General Assembly Reports on Petition Results and Urges Patience Pending Resolution</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The issue of customs employees demanding the issuance of year-end bonuses equivalent to two months' salary and a winter clothing allowance of 4 million yuan per person has not yet been resolved.

<h3>Difficulties Encountered in Planning Sino-Japanese Air Route; Allied Headquarters Insists on Self-Financing of All Ground Equipment and Facilities</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The preparations of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) for opening a Sino-Japanese air route have reportedly encountered difficulties, and whether they will succeed is still uncertain. This is because General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo insists that CNAC must self-finance all ground equipment and daily necessities in Tokyo. Furthermore, although CNAC aircraft can land in Tokyo, Tokyo cannot be the final destination. In this case, CNAC's plan to transport passengers and cargo between Shanghai and Tokyo cannot be realized. Moreover, the cost of self-financing ground equipment and daily necessities without the assistance of General MacArthur's headquarters would be difficult to bear.</p>
<h3>New Year's Break for Journalists; Newspapers Suspend Publication for Three Days</h3>
<p>One hundred and seventeen members of the Shanghai Journalists Association believe that colleagues in the news industry work diligently throughout the year, exhausting their energy.

After exchanging opinions, it was unanimously agreed that all newspapers in the city had already complied with the resolution of the Newspaper Industry Association and suspended publication for three days. As for the Shanghai Central Daily News, it was ordered by the Central Government not to suspend publication. The authorities of the newspaper had obtained the consent of the newspaper's employees to reduce the number of pages published each day during the suspension period so that they could take turns to rest.

<h3>Garrison Command Smashes Air-Transported Drug Trafficking Operation; Shanghai-Beiping Network Captured in One Fell Swoop</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command recently cracked a major case of drug trafficking by air transport. The mastermind was a military officer controlled by the Communists. His drug procurement network was located in Shanghai and Beiping. The drugs were transported out of the Communist area and distributed to various locations through his network. The quantity involved was very large. The Garrison Command's Investigation Division received a tip and first cracked the network in Shanghai, arresting more than ten suspects. Then, based on the clues, it sent Team Leader Yan of the Seventh Investigation Brigade to Beiping, where they worked with the Beiping municipal military and police authorities to crack the network there and arrest all the important suspects. Team Leader Yan completed his mission and returned to Shanghai by plane a few days ago, bringing the suspects along on the same plane. The confessions are currently being sorted out and reported. The details will be released in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Coldly Observing People of All Walks of Life in the Registration Room of the District Prosecutor's Office; Regardless of Your Identity, Everyone Is Equal Here: Inexhaustible Strange Shapes and Each Has Their Own Expressions</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Sitting in the registration room of the District Prosecutor's Office for half an hour and seeing a microcosm of people from all walks of life in Shanghai is a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>All criminal cases, except for a small number of special criminal cases and self-prosecutions, must go through the investigation stage to determine whether to prosecute or not. In a large and densely populated city like Shanghai, the frequency of conflicts and disputes between people every day means that once a legal issue is involved, the first hurdle is the District Prosecutor's Office, and the first hurdle during the investigation is the registration room. Therefore, the registration room is constantly busy and its threshold is worn through.</p>
<p>When a complainant or defendant receives a summons from the prosecutor, the summons specifies the date and time. They arrive at the District Prosecutor's Office on time and show the summons to the duty bailiff in the registration room. The bailiff registers the summons and fills out a roll call list. When the prosecutor handling the case opens the court, the bailiff holding the roll call sheet calls out the summoned person, who is led by the bailiff into the designated investigation court to be questioned by the prosecutor. The investigation period is absolutely secret, and no one is allowed to eavesdrop. After the prosecutor has finished questioning, he indicates on the roll call sheet whether the person is to be detained, released on bail, or dismissed, depending on the severity of the case.</p>
<p>Two Exceptions. Different Expressions.</p>
<p>Don't look down on these two unremarkable bungalows. Many dignitaries, prominent officials, wealthy merchants, magnates, monks, Taoists, women, and even mistresses have to sit on cold benches here. People from all walks of life, such as Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan; Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Anle Textile Factory; Xu Letian, former Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee; Lin Fengbao, former Director of the National Bank's Business Bureau; Yang Anren, Deputy Director; Jin Laohu Zhan Yunsheng; Yang Laohu Mesi Bo; Zhu Huang Fangbai, who falsely claimed to be a female judge; Yong Ci, Xin Ci, Zhen, Xingkong, monks from Longhua Temple; Fa Wu, Fa Jing, Rong Zhou, Lin Qing, nuns from Jingxiu Nunnery; all kinds of people are here. No matter how luxurious and stylish they are usually, at this time, they all restrain themselves and sit quietly in a corner waiting to be summoned. In the past year, there have only been two exceptions who were questioned directly by the prosecutor without going through the registration room: one was former National Bank President Bei Zuyi, and the other was former Director of the Direct Taxation Bureau, Lou Guowei.</p>
<p>Coldly Watching the Different Expressions of People Waiting in the Registration Room</p>
<p>Each person has a different expression, which is the best place to observe and analyze each person's psychology. All are restless, pacing back and forth; some are silent and close their eyes to rest; some are muttering words, as if rehearsing the answers to questions in court; some have been waiting too long and fall asleep; some who have been beaten are groaning; some drug addicts are lying on the ground and yelling. All kinds of strange shapes are endless.</p>
<h3>Prosecutors Hate Scalpers</h3>
<p>Because the investigation period is secret, defendants are generally most afraid of being detained. Some cunning people take advantage of this weakness and create a group of court scalpers. These people use the nearby teahouses as their base camp and claim to be familiar with the prosecutors and can find a way to get people released on bail. The parties inevitably have to spend a little money. If the case is not serious, the prosecutor may know that bail will be granted or the person will be dismissed. The parties do not know the details and sincerely appreciate the scalpers' help. Unfortunately, if they are detained, the scalpers claim that the number of people they lobbied was not enough. In reality, the prosecutors are wrongly accused. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office often hates these scalpers. The last time the owners of several teahouses were summoned was for this matter. Since that summons, the scalpers have been afraid of legal sanctions and have slightly restrained themselves, daring not to be too blatant.</p>
<h3>Steamship Companies Considering Price Increase; Meeting to Discuss Tomorrow; Expected to Increase by 70 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Steamship companies in the city are considering raising prices again due to recent price increases. It is also learned that the price of allocated coal will increase by 50 percent. The cost of wharves is nearly 3 million yuan per ton. Although freight and passenger fares increased by 45 percent starting on November 21st of last year, this is no longer sufficient to cover costs. The Rates Committee of the Steamship Commercial Association convened an emergency meeting on the 2nd to discuss how to make up for the high costs. As a result, the committee recommended to the board of directors and supervisors that freight and ticket prices be adjusted to make up for the costs. It is learned that the board of directors and supervisors of the Steamship Association will hold a regular meeting tomorrow to discuss the Rates Committee's recommendation to adjust freight and ticket prices. The expected adjustment is approximately 70 percent.</p>

<h3>Maritime Affairs Bureau Completes Takeover of Tong-Song Section of Pilotage Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Ministry of Communications ordered maritime affairs bureaus in various locations to take over the pilotage associations last year. The pilotage affairs of the Tong-Song section in Shanghai were previously under the jurisdiction of the River and Sea Customs Patrol Works Department. After receiving the order, the Maritime Affairs Bureau contacted the River and Sea Customs. It is now learned that the takeover was completed at the end of last year. It is heard that the bureau has also sent officers to contact the Song-Han section regarding pilotage affairs and will hand over the operations as soon as the formalities are completed.</p>

<h3>A Batch of Habitual Thieves Caught; Six Firearms Seized</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Jiangning Police Branch officer Xu Jintang learned on December 28th of last year that a large number of hardened bandits were hiding in the area. He reported it to Branch Director Wang, who ordered the chief of the criminal division, Lin Deming, to personally lead patrol officer Hu Xiaoyi, division members Wang Qi, police chiefs Wu Dekui, Gu Yingxuan, and Sun Wenxi, and officers Hu Zhijie and Li Baosheng to No. 4, Lane 1384, Fanhuanji Road at around 2:00 PM that afternoon. They arrested bandit Chen Changlin. At 4:30 PM on the same afternoon, they arrested his accomplice Xu Pinzhang at No. 7 in the same lane. In his residence, they seized one Mauser pistol, five bullets, one C96 pistol, four bullets, one women's dark blue chevron overcoat, and one pearl ring. Based on Xu's confession, officers were sent to No. 11, Lane 860, Tian'anli Road at around 5:00 or 6:00 PM and continued to apprehend accomplice Zhu Baosheng. At 9:00 PM, Wang Muxiang was apprehended at Chen Changlin's home at No. 1384, Fanhuanji Road. Police then proceeded to Wang's house at No. 1, Garden Lane, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, and seized two Mauser pistols and five bullets. They also found stolen goods such as jade earrings, small rings, silver ingots, silver rings, velvet shirts, and 2.09 million yuan in cash. On the afternoon of the 29th, at 8:00 PM, it was learned that the bandit leader Chen Zhirong lived at No. 17, Lane 476, Changning Road. Officers were dispatched, but Chen was out. Only his mother-in-law, Xia Zhang Xiucui, and his wife, Chen Xia Xiuli, were apprehended. An eight-inch revolver and forty-two bullets were found in the shed. A herringbone wool Western-style overcoat was also discovered. According to Chen Changlin's confession, Zhu Baosheng still had a pistol and ten bullets with him. Subsequently, after Zhu was arrested, a loaded firearm was indeed seized.</p>
<p>The bandits confessed that:</p>
<p>*   On July 7th last fall, at 11:00 AM, they robbed Chen Mingzhi's home at No. 122 Julu Road, stealing cash and jewelry estimated to be worth more than 90 million yuan.</p>
<p>*   On October 8th, they robbed the Qianjian family at No. 12, Lane 269, Huai'an Road, stealing clothing and jewelry worth 18.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>*   On November 3rd, they robbed a group of people of 5 million yuan in cash at No. 1394, Zhongzheng East Road intersection.</p>
<p>*   On November 13th, they robbed the Xinyi Needle and Thread Shop Longfa Branch, opened by Ding Zhu at No. 12, Lane 57, Zijin Road, of 38 million yuan in fiat currency.</p>
<p>*   On December 16th, at 12:00 PM, they robbed four households at No. 45 Jinjia Lane, Xinzha Road, including the Lu family, stealing jade rings and other items. They robbed Yang Chen Biqiu of 500,000 yuan in cash. Also, they robbed the Chen Jia Geng, an apprentice at the Jinlan Company on Linsen Middle Road, of a dark blue chevron women's overcoat that was just delivered to Fan Mingren's house.</p>
<p>The police branch plans to transfer the case to the court for prosecution after the investigation is completed.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan's Air Transport Team Approved to Continue for Another Year; Future Name Undecided</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Executive Yuan's Air Transport Team, led by Flying Tiger General Chennault, was scheduled to conclude its operations at the end of last year along with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA).

<h3>New Year's New Policy in Hong Kong: Civil Servants' Salary Increase Announced on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>(Our Report from Hong Kong, 1st) This is the third New Year since the British re-entered Hong Kong. If the first New Year was the "Year of Military Administration" and the second was the "Year of Merchants," then this New Year is the "Year of Civil Servants." The long-awaited salary increase for Hong Kong government civil servants was finally officially announced on New Year's Day. Those with a monthly salary of HK$1,000 will receive a 30% increase, those with HK$1,500 will receive a 20% increase, and laborers with the lowest salaries will receive a 200% increase (but they will benefit the least compared to those with high salaries). In addition, those with a monthly salary of HK$150 or more will also receive a "cost of living allowance" of at least HK$100 and at most HK$480. Therefore, a mid-level civil servant who previously earned around HK$200 per month will see their income increase to over HK$400 after the raise. Not only that, but the salary increase will be calculated from January 1, 1947. In other words, in addition to an increase of more than half in their income from New Year's Day, civil servants can also receive back pay for the past 12 months, ranging from HK$400 or HK$500 to HK$2,000 or HK$3,000. The Hong Kong government has stated that it will be issued in full before the Lunar New Year, so they can truly enjoy a "prosperous year"! While the general public is congratulating civil servants, some civil servants are expressing mixed joy and fear, suggesting that the Hong Kong government may offset part of the back pay with the repayment of the Recovery and Reconstruction Bonds. Merchants in general have paid close attention to this matter because, with an average of HK$500 in back pay for each of the 20,000 Hong Kong government civil servants, the market before the Lunar New Year will see an immediate increase of HK$1 million in purchasing power, which is truly a tonic for the currently sluggish market. The general salaried class, who are not civil servants, both envy and worry about this good news for civil servants, because they not only have no opportunity for a salary increase but also face the threat of rising prices due to the HK$1 million stimulus. As for economists, they suspect the Hong Kong dollar's inflation and are further elaborating on "profound theories," which need not be discussed here. These past two days, the weather in Hong Kong has been particularly sunny, harmonious, and warm, with a feeling of gentle breezes and a bright sun. This is a rare respite given by nature to those "living in peace and quiet," and it is indeed precious. (Special Correspondent Zi Jian)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Orders Completion of County Telephone Networks by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>(Our Report from Zhenjiang, 3rd) While bandit suppression is underway in both southern and northern Jiangsu, the provincial government, in order to coordinate with military operations, has ordered all counties to complete their rural and town telephone networks to strengthen communications. The "Measures for Establishing Rural and Town Telephone Networks" were passed at the 147th Provincial Government Meeting. The main points are summarized as follows: Each county and city will use its seat of government as the hub of the telephone network and establish a telephone exchange. Counties and cities with telecommunications bureaus should connect with nearby counties and cities and connect to long-distance lines. The main telephone lines will be guarded by self-defense team members dispatched by the district and township offices under the jurisdiction of the county and city governments, who will be responsible for patrolling day and night to prevent bandits from sabotage and thieves from stealing. Each county and city should purchase and store materials for emergency repairs. The telephone networks of each county and city must be completed by the end of January. Counties and cities that have not been fully recovered should set up the networks as soon as they are recovered and complete them within one month. The expenses required for setting up the telephone network and purchasing equipment will be covered by the original expenses and the second reserve fund of the counties and cities. If these are insufficient, additional funds should be raised in consultation with the county and city councils to ensure rapid completion within the deadline. No delays or failures will be permitted under the pretext of financial difficulties, and the progress of the work must be reported to the province for inspection.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Middle Schools Respond to Famine and Cold Relief Campaign</h3>

<h3>Severe Bank Erosion on the Coast of Changyinsha</h3>
<p>(Our Report from Changshu, 3rd) The coastal erosion along the Jiangyinsha beach is extremely severe. The bank protection project is urgently needed.

They saw that the local residents were poorly clad, emaciated, and shivering in the cold wind, and the misery was unbearable. A report has now been prepared and submitted to County Magistrate Zhang for approval. Furthermore, the joint defense office of the three counties of Tong, Cheng, and Chu has been actively carrying out its mission to eliminate bandits by organizing commando teams, establishing an intelligence network, dispatching elite troops, and patrolling along the river to maintain security. To adapt to the needs of the environment, a business committee will be formed, and local people and leaders from all walks of life will be appointed as members to promote effectiveness. The director of the office, an expert named Shi, came to the city on the 3rd to widely report to County Magistrate Zhang and others to discuss important matters of current affairs.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Traitorous Bandits Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>(Our Report from Wuxi, 1st) Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has recently been extremely concerned about the increasingly complex public security in the four rural districts of the county. Magistrate Xu, also aware of the grave situation, personally went to the Baziqiao Town in the northern district on the 30th of last month and convened relevant personnel. Based on reliable intelligence, they immediately began searching and suppressing bandits that night, arresting a total of more than ten people, including the Communist Party leader Ju Juqi and bandits Guan Renquan. The next day, they went to Changanqiao and other places, arresting more than ten people, including bandit army leader Tu Pingsheng and gangster Zhong Longbao. After interrogation, all of them were found to be guilty and were taken to the county for interrogation. Furthermore, the County Police Bureau was ordered to seize the property of traitorous bandit leader Zhang Zhuoru. The Anzhen Sub-bureau, together with the Seventh District Office, has seized a house in Beintang Lane under the bandit's warehouse and more than ten mu of paddy fields. The bandit harassed the four rural districts, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and a reward of 100 million yuan had been offered for his capture. The police bureau is currently searching for him.</p>

<h3>Liang Officer Liu Xinru Colludes with Rice Merchants for Profit; Four People Indicted for Corruption</h3>
<p>(Our Report from Suzhou, 4th) Liu Xinru, a warehouse administrator at the Jiangyin County Food and Grain Office, has been using his position to convert over 2,800 shi of stored grain tax rice into cash since the winter before last. He colluded with rice merchants Xu Chuxiong, Liu Boming, and Hua Yunqing to engage in business for profit. In June of last year, the county's Grain Collection Supervision Committee discovered this and confirmed it after checking the warehouse. The Jiangyin County Government turned the case over to the Wuxian District Procuratorate for investigation and handling. It has now been learned that the investigation has been concluded.

<h3>Pioneering Spirit: Two or Three Things About the Hunan-Guangxi Railway</h3>
<p>(Our Report from Hengyang, 3rd) Looking at a railway map of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway area, there are four lines in this area, just like an X shape, or like a slender-waisted woman lying there, raising both arms and spreading her legs. Her left arm extends to Hengyang, Hunan, shaking hands with her sister—the Guangdong-Hankou Railway; her right arm stretches to Guiyang on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau; one leg crosses the Ten Thousand Mountains and extends to Zhennanguan; the other leg stretches into Guangzhou Bay. Now, her left arm has been activated, and her right arm is gradually recovering. Only her two legs are still in a state of paralysis. When will she be able to stand up? Judging from the current situation, it is unknown when that will be!</p>
<h3>Relentless Shelling: Destroyed Her Arms</h3>
<p>The heart of this slender-waisted woman is located in Liuzhou. The left arm from Liuzhou to Hengyang is the Hunan-Guangxi Line of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway, which is 560 kilometers long and passes through Luorong, Yongfu, Guilin, Xing'an, Quanxian, Lengshuitan, and reaches Hengyang City. It is the major artery of the southwest, built during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and has made great contributions to military and economic transportation. Unfortunately, in the autumn of 1944, the military situation in Hunan and Guangxi deteriorated, and the enemy invaded westward. This wartime major artery of the southwest fell into enemy hands. Subsequently, the enemy, with overwhelming force, advanced directly to eastern Guizhou, and her right arm—the Guizhou-Guangxi Line—was also destroyed. At that time, our policy against the enemy was "scorched earth resistance" and "clearing the fields and strengthening the walls," so the railway naturally needed to be destroyed under this policy. On the eve of the railway bureau's evacuation, all important projects and equipment such as bridges, tunnels, culverts, locomotives, and vehicles were ruthlessly destroyed, especially the bridges and culverts, which were destroyed most thoroughly. There were more than 100 large and small bridges on the Hunan-Guangxi Line, and about 50 culverts, all of which were completely destroyed in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Giving Priority to Others: Delayed Traffic for Two Years</h3>
<p>After the war ended, the rehabilitation of the railways was the most important part of the national rehabilitation effort. However, limited by financial resources, the government could not rehabilitate all the railways at the same time and could only weigh the importance of each at the time, giving priority to repairing the roads that needed to be repaired more urgently. The Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Hankou, and Guangdong-Hankou Railways were the ones that needed to be given priority at that time. It was not that the Hunan-Guangxi Railway area was not important, but compared to the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways, it was less important at the beginning of the national rehabilitation. Therefore, the Hunan-Guangxi section was only opened to traffic two years after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Those who do not understand the inside story may not think that this opening to traffic after a delay of two years is anything to praise. In fact, the opening to traffic of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway this time is certainly worthy of special mention in the history of transportation in the southwest, and the spirit of hard work and struggle has not been seen in the rehabilitation of any other railway in the country today. Last month, foreign personnel from UNRRA visited the rehabilitation project and marveled at the spirit of struggle of the Hunan-Guangxi Line this time, calling it a miracle in the history of engineering. It is certainly not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Dismantling and Supplementing: A Clever Woman Cannot Cook Without Rice</h3>
<p>The Hunan-Guangxi Line first opened the Liuzhou-Guilin section in January of this year, and then began the track restoration work from Guilin to Hengyang. The Ministry of Communications ordered the completion of the entire line by the end of December of this year, but there was an extreme shortage of materials, especially the steel rails and accessories for the 230-kilometer section from Quanxian to Hengyang, which had been dismantled and moved to repair the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. It was really impossible for a clever woman to cook without rice because it was impossible to supplement such a long section of steel rails and sleepers. Seeing this situation, the Ministry of Communications promised to allocate 260 kilometers of steel rails and 350,000 sleepers, but for various reasons, nothing was ever delivered. In this situation, the railway comrades had no choice but to weigh the priorities, move the slow to help the urgent, and adapt to the environment. They dismantled and supplemented the section of track from Nandan to Jinchengjiang and all other branch lines, which added a lot of difficulty to the work. (Special Correspondent Huang Chaoru)</p>

<h3>After the Hong Kong Governor's Visit to Nanjing, a Financial Agreement Will Be Implemented Today; Goods Shipped to Hong Kong for Transit Must Submit a Certificate; The Limit for Carrying National Currency Is 5 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] All parties are greatly concerned about the Sino-Hong Kong agreement. According to the spokesman of the Central Bank, the agreement was signed on August 15 last year. Since then, changes have taken place in the environment on both sides, so the Hong Kong side still needs to make considerable adjustments. After the Hong Kong Governor visited Nanjing to discuss the matter, it was decided to implement the following provisions of the agreement first. Preparations have now been completed and implementation is beginning.</p>
<p>Starting from January 5, major export goods from our country, such as antimony, tin, tung oil, rapeseed oil, pig bristles, and cotton yarn, must submit a "CBC8a Revised" certificate when shipped to Hong Kong for transit, proving that the foreign exchange earned from shipping these goods from China to Hong Kong has been sold to or stipulated to be credited to a designated Chinese bank. Otherwise, the Hong Kong government will not allow transit exports.</p>
<p>The spokesman of the National Bank said that this measure will be of great value in the management of China's export foreign exchange. It is expected that the foreign exchange income of our government can be increased. As a result, the import foreign exchange quota in the South China region has recently been appropriately relaxed.</p>
<p>From the same day, the Hong Kong government will prohibit carrying more than 5 million yuan in cash in and out of the country. This measure is the same as China's current method of restricting the shipment of cash. The Hong Kong government is now formulating rules to manage general banks. This is a stricter method for the Hong Kong government to manage the so-called money industry organizations that have been established in Hong Kong in recent years. At the same time, it will enable our country to more effectively curb the current situation of evading existing management methods and illegally profiting.</p>
<p>One item in the financial agreement is that the manifest of any ship sailing from Hong Kong to China must be stamped by the Hong Kong government. This method has already been implemented.</p>
<p>All the terms of this financial agreement are concrete measures that are interconnected. In the spirit of cooperation and goodwill, the two governments have conducted careful and precise consultations to ensure that the interests of both parties are taken into account before this achievement can be achieved. This agreement is an important milestone in the relationship between our country and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As for the implementation of other steps in the agreement, they are also actively under negotiation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th Special Telegram] The Hong Kong government announced that in the future, certain designated Chinese products, such as tungsten, antimony, wool, oils, rapeseed oil, tin tea, pig bristles, cotton yarn, etc., must be accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by the Chinese authorities when exported from Hong Kong. It also said that the government's measure is to help China protect its foreign exchange income from major export goods, but such certificates are not required for export goods that are not Chinese native products. Currently, account holders storing Chinese-produced goods here must register the stored goods with the Hong Kong Import and Export Trade Department before the 8th of this month. The registered goods will not be subject to this new measure.</p>
<h3>Price Increases Reported in Production Areas, Arrivals Scarce; Shanghai White Japonica Rice Fluctuates Violently; Municipal Government Cables Jiangsu Provincial Government to Quickly Stabilize Prices in Production Areas</h3>
<p>During the New Year holidays, the price of rice in the city rose sharply. Although the North and South markets were not officially open, there were many buyers, and those holding goods refused to sell, forming a situation where there was a price but no market. On the 3rd, the market price, after the authorities' best efforts to persuade, the opening price of white japonica rice was 1.2 million yuan per unit, while the retail price was very chaotic.</p>
<p>According to the investigation of the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, the reasons for the rise in rice prices are: Price increases reported in production areas, Arrivals scarce, The market is abnormal, There are off-market transactions in the suburbs, The year-end bonuses of employees in various industries in the city have been successively distributed. This huge amount of hot money is competing to buy food rice as the target, and after the stocks of retailers are snapped up by citizens, they are eager to replenish them, driving up the price again and again.</p>
<p>In addition to having telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to quickly stabilize rice prices in the production areas and facilitate transportation, the municipal authorities have also ordered economic police to be dispatched in full force on the 5th to supervise the rice markets and other markets in order to stabilize general prices.</p>
<p>No Plans to Sell Food Rice Yet</p>
<p>Also, the North and South Rice Markets rose in a straight line after the 2nd. The price of white japonica rice from Wuxi production area was quoted at 1.25 million yuan per dan (picul) the day before yesterday (the 3rd). The North Market immediately rose, and the closing price was above 1.3 million yuan, and the retail price exceeded 1.4 million yuan. Therefore, Mayor Wu telegraphed the Executive Yuan President Zhang, requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be ordered to quickly stop the soaring price of rice in Wuxi, and telegraphed the Grain Department and the China Farmers Bank to stop purchasing in the production areas. Regarding whether the Social Affairs Bureau will restore the selling policy when necessary, Director Wu said yesterday that the authorities have not considered this yet, and that selling would only create opportunities for merchants and people to hoard if it could not be dealt with skillfully, and consumers would not have any rights to gain.</p>
<h3>This Year's Increase in Domestic Paper Production Will Focus on Newspapers</h3>
<p>The paper that is currently most lacking domestically are three types: newspaper, cigarette paper, and banknote paper. Cigarette paper requires 100,000 tons per month, and the Shanghai Minfeng Factory has already produced 60,000 tons, and it is expected to be self-sufficient this year. Newspapers are very scarce and urgently need to increase production. At the paper production increase meeting convened by the National Economic Council in Nanjing last year, it was decided that this year's increase in newspaper production will be the main focus, accounting for half of the estimated planned figures. The proportion of imported pulp for paper production has been relaxed to 42%, because ordinary one ton of pulp can be mixed with two tons of waste cotton etc., which can produce three tons of newspaper, saving two-thirds of the foreign exchange for paper. The various paper companies under the Resources Committee are tasked with producing 10,000 tons of paper this year. However, judging from the current situation of various factories, it is particularly difficult. Only the Shenyang factory in the five Northeast paper factories is still able to produce. Production at the two Andong factories, the Dangkou factory, and the Jinzhou factory has been suspended due to damage. Although the factories in Taiwan are more developed, there is still a shortage of raw materials. If Taiwan Sugar can increase production to 600,000 tons this year, sugarcane stalks can be used as raw materials for papermaking, which can supply other factories. As for the manufacturing plants in the suburbs of Tianjin, if there is no shortage of raw materials and electricity in the future, the No. 3 machine will be dedicated to producing newspapers, then the paper needs of the two cities of Peiping and Tianjin can be satisfied. The monthly output must be maintained at at least 200 tons this year. In terms of raw materials, sulfur procurement is the most difficult. Bitter soil (i.e., magnesium oxide), which is necessary for reed pulp papermaking, has been unable to supply since the fall of Dashiqiao. If the Tianjin Paper Factory wants to increase production to the planned quantity, it now needs to purchase a large amount of reeds. At least 15,000 tons must be purchased, and the current market price is 2 million yuan per ton, totaling 30 billion yuan. The paper factory itself feels unable to raise this huge amount of money.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rising Sharply</h3>
<p>During the New Year holidays, the Taiwan Corporation's first phase of distribution continued as usual on the 2nd. The prices of Taiwan Red and Cotton White Sugar did not change, but informal transactions were very active among peers due to the winter sales promotion, so prices rose in unison. The degree of the rise was like white sugar rising by about 15-16% and red sugar rising by about 15-16%, while green sugar rose by about 19-16% due to the lack of arrivals. It is predicted that the market may be slightly stable today, but it depends on whether the actual sales are positive or not.</p>
<p>High Price for Green Bamboo Shoots</p>
<p>Green bamboo shoots are in season for winter sales, and the opening price has been raised again and again. During the New Year holidays, high-quality embroidery tip embroidery lakes, combined with sub-brands, opened to 8 million yuan, and the momentum was very good.</p>
<h3>China Agricultural and Industrial Bank Moves to New Address for Business</h3>

<h3>During the New Year Holidays, the Stock Market Called for High Prices</h3>
<p>Although the days before yesterday were New Year's holidays, there were some scattered off-market transactions. Yongsha, which will be delivered today, was once called as high as 600 yuan, and there was a supply at the final price of 585 yuan. The Hong Kong Shen Electric price at the end of the year has been reported to have shrunk to within 3 yuan. People's hearts are still profitable, and it is expected that Yongsha will be around the 600 yuan mark in the red market today.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Gold Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] The market price of gold jumped 10 yuan today, opening at 304 Hong Kong dollars per tael and closing at 314 yuan, still with high buying interest. The reason for the strong buying trend is that it is easy to smuggle to Guangzhou, where a profit of 5 Hong Kong dollars per tael can be obtained.</p>
<p>Also, the Central Trust Bureau has resumed operations in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>An Additional Tax of 45% Is Levied on Taxable Imported Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a public announcement by the Jianghai Customs yesterday: taxable imported goods (excluding cotton, rice, flour, coal, and coke, goods settled at the official price, and gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil. Goods with increased import tax), from January 1 to June 30 of this year, a temporary surcharge of 45% will be levied on the existing customs surcharge, and the two surcharges together will be 50%. This exchange has already notified this in Announcement No. 181 on January 1 this year. It is now found that for the aforementioned goods that were declared for import before January 1 this year, and the tax payment certificates issued by this exchange, if the tax is not paid within 15 days from the date of issuance as stipulated, the tax payment certificate should be invalid as per regulations, and this exchange will issue a new tax payment certificate and levy a temporary surcharge. All of the aforementioned overdue tax payment certificates should be submitted to the General Affairs Section of this exchange for cancellation.</p>
<h3>Application Procedures for Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Materials Arriving at Port</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the issue of purchasing self-provided foreign exchange materials arriving at port, importers and the Central Trust Bureau have reached a consensus in principle on various detailed measures. Furthermore, the markup percentages for paper and steel have been agreed upon and announced. Research and discussion on other materials such as hardware, copper, tin, wood, raw materials, and pigments have also commenced, and it is expected that solutions will be reached successively in the near future. Regarding the detailed procedures for applying for purchase and applying for acquisition, importers generally lack clarity. Therefore, our reporter specifically visited Hua Hongxiao, the general representative who represented sixteen industry trade associations in negotiations with the bureau, to inquire about the detailed procedures for applying for the purchase and acquisition of self-provided foreign exchange materials arriving at port. According to him:</p>
<p>After the markup percentage for the materials of the industry concerned is announced, if the importing merchant is willing to sell the materials arriving at port to the government, they should immediately send a letter with the returned registration copy issued by the Secretariat of the Import Management Committee, stating their willingness to sell, or adding words such as hoping that the applicant will still have priority in acquiring the materials after the purchase. Along with this, they should submit the original bill of lading (without endorsement), the original invoice, and six copies of the completed application permit to the designated bank for transfer to the responsible department of the Import Management Committee (goods in Schedules 1 and 3 are under the jurisdiction of the Non-Quota Department, while goods in Schedule 2 are under the jurisdiction of the Allocation Department).</p>
<p>After receiving the above application, the responsible department of the Import Management Committee will review it and send it to the Visa Department for visa processing. After the visa is issued, the permit and bill of lading will be directly sent to the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>After receiving the documents transferred by the Import Management Committee, the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau will fill out and issue a purchase notification letter, which will be sent directly to the original applicant importing merchant. At the same time, a blank "Application for Purchase by the Central Trust Bureau" form will be attached for use.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the purchase notification from the Central Trust Bureau, the importing merchant should complete the purchase application form and all required documents within two weeks and submit them to the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau. At the same time, they should request a priority purchase application form from the Central Trust Bureau, as well as documents such as the "List of Contracts Sold to Direct Users" for completion. After receiving the purchase application form and attachments, the Central Trust Bureau will issue a "Purchase Certificate" to the original importing merchant for safekeeping. This purchase certificate serves as a receipt for the purchased goods and will be used to exchange for special foreign currency deposit certificates in the future.</p>
<p>Within three weeks after the Central Trust Bureau issues the purchase certificate, the importing merchant must complete the "Priority Purchase Application Form" and submit it along with two copies of the direct user order and ten copies of the direct user contract list. The contract list should bear the certification stamp of the trade association and be submitted to the Central Trust Bureau for priority purchase.</p>
<p>After receiving the purchase application, the Central Trust Bureau will review it to ensure it complies with the regulations and then notify the original importing merchant to complete the purchase procedures. After receiving this notice, the original importing merchant will go to the Central Trust Bureau to sign the contract and find two reputable shop guarantors to sign the guarantee on the contract. For the payment of the goods, 25% will be paid in cash, 25% will be paid with a 30-day commercial acceptance bill, and 50% will be paid with a 45-day commercial acceptance bill. Once the above procedures are completed, the original bill of lading will be borrowed from the Central Trust Bureau, along with the signed import permit, and the original importing merchant will handle customs clearance (the original importing merchant will take delivery of the goods first, and the other one-half will be returned to the Central Trust Bureau as collateral, and at the same time, the previous "Bill of Lading Guarantee Letter" will be withdrawn.)</p>
<p>After the 45-day period expires and the Central Trust Bureau receives the final acceptance bill without error, the original importing merchant who purchased the goods can retrieve the remaining one-half of the bill of lading from the Central Trust Bureau, as well as the special foreign currency deposit certificates that were deposited but not claimed. At this point, the entire procedure for applying for purchase and allocation of purchase is completed.</p>

<h3>Management of Scientific Research in the United States</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zuoqing</p>
<p>Fifty-two public scientific research institutes in the United States, with 30,000 scientists engaged, have spent $200 million on equipment, researching various issues, including preventing pests and diseases in tomatoes, as well as atomic energy and cancer. Last year, the cost of public scientific research exceeded $600 million, of which $400 million was for research at universities, factories, mines, and financial institutions. As for the cost of private research, it is estimated to be worth $60 million. The above is a report from the National Science Foundation in Washington.</p>
<p>Last October, John R. Steelman, Director of the Scientific Research Board of the United States, published a reorganization plan for the entire U.S. government's scientific research agencies in his treatise, "Management of Scientific Research." This treatise first stated the need for reorganizing scientific research agencies.</p>
<p>"Today, the nation is spending unprecedented financial resources on scientific research and development, but we must have an accurate policy. Our goal is to promote human health, increase our happiness, and improve living standards, while also considering the needs of national defense security. Therefore, we require the government to take steps to achieve the most effective utilization."</p>
<p>Steelman proposed the following steps:</p>
<p>Establish a joint committee of various scientific research departments to unify planning, comprehensively plan the work of each department, and achieve the greatest possible gains.</p>
<p>Establish a expenditure agency to review the relationship of state research plans to the government's overall scientific plan.</p>
<p>In the President's council, there must be one person specifically responsible for transmitting news of scientific secrets and inventions among scientists to Congress and departments related to scientific administration.</p>
<p>Congress should authorize the establishment of a National Science Foundation, with half of its members being directors of government scientific research administrative departments and half being reputable scientists and educators from the private sector. The foundation has the power to handle the allocation of funds to universities and state research institutions.</p>
<p>In this 324-page treatise, Director Steelman discussed various trivial issues in detail, without any omissions. For example, the government must pay scientific researchers an annual salary of $15,000, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, the treatise emphasized that the general plan's provisions do not imply centralized management and new legal controls. "To fully achieve the goal of maximizing the happiness of all people, the government must shoulder this huge responsibility to ensure that a large amount of financial resources are not wasted. Only under the same goal determined by the government can we work together to achieve success."</p>
<h3>Element Plutonium 94 of the Atomic Age</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>Since John Dalton created the atomic theory, chemists have arranged the periodic table of their painstaking efforts. From Madam Curie's discovery of radium and the research of various radioactive substances to Dr. O.E. Lawrence's smashing of atoms, there have been a series of amazing changes and achievements in the scientific world.</p>
<p>The great scientific progress has enabled mankind to not only understand and use all materials but also to start creating everything it needs. The transmutation of radioactive materials and the research of splitting atoms have led mankind to discover new elements for human use. Plutonium is the latest product.</p>
<p>To this day, this new element has not only been successfully manufactured, but it is hoped that it can be mass-produced soon.</p>
<p>The completion of this work will be the completion of a revolution in the scientific and power worlds. It leads mankind to truly embark on the road of the atomic age and completely changes everything today. Therefore, this human-created element is not only the most powerful vanguard but will also be a pillar in the atomic age.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years of careful research and thousands of experiments have analyzed and summarized the raw materials that create all substances on Earth into many material cornerstones that were considered indivisible at the time—atoms—and arranged them into a fairly perfect table, a periodic table of ninety-two elements.</p>
<p>This is indeed a very valuable table because as long as we know the ordinal number of an atom, we can know its properties fairly accurately in this table. However, there are also two unsatisfactory aspects, namely, the many blanks in the table and why the number of atoms stops at ninety-two.</p>
<p>Scientists examined the elements at the end of the table and found them to be radioactive, so they speculated that the undiscovered elements also had radioactivity and instability. But at that time, the work of groping in the dark was extremely difficult. This work only revealed a glimmer of light after Lawrence smashed the atom in 1939.</p>
<p>The amazing exploration began in the hands of an Italian scientist, Eurco Ferme. Unfortunately, this research was led astray because the result of his using neutrons to disturb uranium 235 was that the elements split were far in the middle of the periodic table, and no new element was obtained.</p>
<p>It was not until 1940 that the correct path was obtained.</p>
<p>Among these pioneers, two have indelible merits: Professor Ewdin M. McMillan and Dr. Philip A. Abelson. They obtained a very small amount of "artificial element" when they controlled deuterons with an atom smasher (Cyclotron) in California, USA, to attack uranium oxide. That is the intermediate product of uranium transforming into plutonium—Neptunium. However, due to the small amount, the existence of plutonium could not be pointed out.</p>
<p>At this time, Glern Segreorg, Arthnr C. Wah, Joseph W. Keunedy, and Emilio Segre were also working in the same direction. By the winter of that year, the work of creating plutonium with an atom smasher was officially completed, and they obtained a very small amount of plutonium. Although the amount was pitifully small, scientists were already able to learn about its chemical properties from this and study its changes from radioactivity. An important report was published by Lawrence in May 1941.</p>
<p>This not only opened a new era in the research of new elements but also influenced the research of atomic bombs. Because scientists pointed out that it is very difficult to extract medium uranium (U235), which is the raw material for atomic bombs, from heavy uranium (U238) with only one percent. We do not necessarily need to separate him, but let him automatically split under neutron bombardment and bomb into a new element, which is plutonium. Even though plutonium is relatively stable, it can also obtain huge atomic energy when split. Because when it is hit, it can also automatically disturb, split, and generate new neutrons, which serve as bombardment particles to complete the so-called chain reaction. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Scientific Discussion</p>
<h3>On the Issue of "Digit Grouping"</h3>
<p>— Kong Fanqing</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhou Shimin's "Sinicization of Digit Grouping" (see Issue 21 of this publication), I couldn't help but be alarmed. Because Mr. Zhou wants to advocate that we use a four-digit grouping system. I think this needs to be reconsidered!</p>
<p>I remember that before 1946, we walked on the left side of the road. After 1946, we changed to walking on the right side. Originally, walking on the left or walking on the right was nothing more than walking in the same direction to avoid facing each other. So? Why change? For no other reason than to have a consistent standard with foreign countries. In today's world of close international exchanges, similar improvements are necessary; they should be actively promoted, and this is the right way. But now Mr. Zhou wants to create this kind of pattern, which is really hard for me to understand. We can think about it. Suppose we use a four-digit grouping system; foreigners will not be able to use the numbers with the grouping points they added. Conversely, foreigners will only be able to recognize the numbers we have grouped with difficulty. At that time, we will suffer the same fate as walking on the left side of the road. Why bother?</p>
<p>Indeed, according to the current trend, our method of recognizing numbers is moving towards a four-digit grouping system. However, we do not have a commonly used four-digit grouping atmosphere. Taking "wan wan wei yi" (ten thousand ten thousands is one hundred million) as "yi" (one hundred million), it was only officially stipulated in 1944. In the past, we also used "shi wan wei yi" (ten ten thousands is one hundred thousand) as "yi."</p>
<p>If we unfold our ancient calculation books, we can also know that the ancient Chinese numbering method, in addition to ge (ones), shi (tens), bai (hundreds), qian (thousands), wan (ten thousands), had three different digits above: The Five Classics Arithmetic, Ji Gu Suan Jing, etc., all talk about digits, saying: "The Yellow Emperor used the law, and the number has ten levels, and its use is three; the ten levels are yi (hundred million), zhao (trillion), jing, gai, zi, rang, gou, jian, zheng, zai. The three levels are shang (upper), zhong (middle), and xia (lower). The lower number is multiplied by ten, as if saying, ten ten thousands is yi, ten yi is zhao, ... The middle number is multiplied by ten thousand, as if saying: ten thousand ten thousands is yi, ten thousand yi is zhao, ... The upper number changes when the number is exhausted, as if saying: ten thousand ten thousands is yi, yi yi is zhao, ..."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the so-called lower number is only a simple form of the decimal system and does not involve grouping. The upper number is a small cycle of four digits, and the large grouping increases according to a geometric progression, which is not a purely four-digit grouping system. Only the middle number uses four-digit grouping. Because of these three regulations of shang, zhong, and xia, our numbers for thousands of years have been disturbed and have no grouping habits. After the "wan wan wei yi" was stipulated, numbers below nine digits can be said to have formed the meaning of four-digit grouping. What about numbers above nine digits? No one knows whether ten yi is , ten thousand yi is zhao, or yi yi is zhao is the correct one; not to mention the grouping method. And numbers below nine digits only need to be divided into two sections, so of course, it cannot be regarded as a complete four-digit grouping habit.</p>
<p>Since we have no grouping habit, we are now just taking advantage of this trend and creating a confrontation with the existing three-digit grouping system, which is really unnecessary. The three-digit grouping system itself is not worse than the four-digit one; its flow into our country is not like an enemy that has broken our balanced market; why should we treat it as an enemy?</p>
<p>In fact, in 1928, someone had already advocated that we use a three-digit grouping system. Mr. Gao Mengdan's appendix to the "Thirteenth Month Calendar" states: On May 7, 1928, Mr. Duan Fuqun and Mr. Luo Shaoxian talked about the three-digit grouping method, the general idea being:</p>
<p>Although this method has long been forgotten by us, it is indeed a wonderful method to guide us to use a three-digit grouping system.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my humble opinion, we should still use Mr. Duan's three-digit grouping system for our grouping method; its advantages are also three: Easy to remember the rules. Conforms to our country's habits and does not lose the original intention of the sages. Consistent with foreign usage. We can directly recognize the numbers that foreigners have grouped well; foreigners can also directly recognize the numbers that we have grouped well. Everyone spends less brainpower on recognizing numbers.</p>
<p>Now we should advocate academic standardization. It is best to have all mankind adopt one standard and work together to study academic knowledge in the world. It is best to have less closed-door car manufacturing!</p>
<p>Scientific Common Sense</p>
<h3>Beware of Coal Poisoning</h3>
<p>— Jia Ling</p>
<p>Most of the residential houses of ordinary people in Shanghai are small and crowded, and there are no heating facilities such as electric furnaces or water heaters. Under the attack of the cold wave, close the windows and doors, light a charcoal fire in the pavilion or厢房 (side room), and sit around to warm up to relieve the severe cold. Or take a bath in the pavilion with a charcoal stove lit. Little do you know that this is suicide! The author has witnessed tragedies, so no matter whether you like to hear it or not, I must ask you to pay attention.</p>
<p>Every winter, there are bound to be several deaths from coal gas poisoning. Even intellectuals and people who are familiar with physics and chemistry may be negligent. Didn't geologist Ding Wenjiang die of coal gas?</p>
<p>Carbon Monoxide Kills Without Blood</p>
<p>Coal cannot burn fully in places where air does not circulate, and carbon monoxide often occurs. In a small room with tightly closed windows, the charcoal stove of course cannot burn fully, and odorless carbon monoxide is produced, which can immediately lead to misfortune. According to E.P, Underhill's report, living in air containing 0.5% carbon monoxide is enough to cause death.</p>
<p>Initially, there is headache and dizziness, the blood vessels in the forehead are dilated and throbbing, and there are symptoms of palpitation and vomiting. The heartbeat is violent, the blood pressure rises, and the face is flushed. Soon after, the pulse is rapid and small, and the breathing is deep and long. As the poisoning deepens, breathing becomes difficult, and the person loses consciousness and falls into a coma. Often, when the poisoning is severe but not yet fatal, the intellect is extremely weak, the thoughts are vague, and the mind is confused, so even if you realize that the poisoning is deep, you want to save yourself, but the mind and body do not allow it. Children are weak and more likely to die.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide is easily absorbed by the blood when inhaled into the body and produces "Carbon Monoxide Henoglobin," which hinders the transport of oxygen. When various human tissues lack oxygen, they become abnormal. The nervous system is particularly affected, which may cause irreparable damage to the nerves.</p>
<p>Treatment Method</p>
<p>The faster the treatment, the better. The poisoned person should first be moved to fresh air. If breathing stops or is very weak, artificial respiration can be performed, and ammonia gas can be used to stimulate breathing.</p>
<p>The best method is to have the poisoned person inhale a mixture of 5% carbon dioxide and oxygen. Body temperature should be maintained at a normal level, and cardiac stimulants should be given.</p>
<p>Points to Note</p>
<p>1.  Pay attention to air circulation when heating in winter.</p>
<p>2.  If there is sunshine, outdoor games should be played, and do not gather in a small room.</p>
<p>3.  Pay attention to explaining to civilians, especially ignorant housewives, and the merit will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Scientific Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Jing Yi</p>
<p>Now that we know the general properties of food, we can examine the relationship between food and life. Some people believe that the characteristics of individuals and races are often determined by the specific foods they consume. Some people even believe that the British ruled India in the past because the British ate more meat, while the Indians ate more vegetarian food. Meat-eating humans walked into the forests, and after fierce battles, they captured those huge vegetarian animals such as cattle and elephants. Some hunters would rather go to the forest to capture lions than go to the pasture to seize the cattle raised by farmers. This may have something to do with the influence of food!</p>
<p>Doctors often say that eating more rice bran can cure beriberi, which is indeed possible because beriberi is entirely caused by a lack of vitamin B. Rice bran contains a lot of this precious ingredient, but unfortunately, most people are unwilling to eat brown rice and cannot get this precious nutrition.</p>
<p>There is also a discussion about digestibility. I will first explain a term: "Digestibility Coefficient." It refers to the amount of food ingested by animals that is finally absorbed and utilized. Usually, carbohydrates are the most completely digested food component because their chemical composition is simpler than that of other compounds. Among proteins, animal proteins are the easiest to digest. Vegetable proteins are second, and the degree of digestion of mixed foods is obviously higher than that of single foods (at present, there is still proof that carbohydrates and proteins are incompatible). Other foods such as starchy foods of shells seem to be more suitable for human digestive tracts and easier to absorb after cooking; however, this cooking does not have any fundamental effect on absorption, it just shortens the digestion time. Because the natural grains are often surrounded by a layer of fibrous sheath, cooking actually softens this layer of lignin and at the same time splits the starch in preparation for the gastric juice to carry out its digestion.</p>
<p>The time it takes for food to pass through the entire digestive tract of a normal person is about 12 to 14 hours. If a considerable amount of food exceeds or falls short of this limit, it is an abnormal phenomenon. After carbohydrates or proteins are mixed with fat, the fat surrounds each particle and must first be emulsified before the digestive juice can enter the process. This digestion time will of course be longer. According to this principle, we can explain why some people do not feel hungry easily after eating oily things such as fried potatoes? This is because these foods are mixtures containing fat, which take a longer time to digest in the stomach, so they can use this to get through the entire morning of hunger.</p>
<p>Of course, after an animal is over-fatigued, a large amount of lactic acid is produced in its body tissues, and its muscles are also relatively weak. In addition, animals that have been severely frightened also have the same phenomenon, so we should also pay attention to this point when selecting meat.</p>
<p>Cook food with an appropriate amount of water (this is the simplest and most important method in cooking because this small matter is closely related to health. The minerals and water-soluble vitamins in food often rely on water to exert their osmotic effect and can enter the marinade. However, vegetables cooked in an excessive amount of water often lose more than 50% of their minerals (such as iron, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, iodine and other compounds, liquid), and vitamins not only lose part of them in the solution due to boiling, but also heat has a destructive effect on them. Vitamins are the easiest to be damaged. In addition to being soluble in water, they also vaporize at high temperatures and lose their important effects on human physiology. Therefore, when we eat noodles, the initial noodle soup should not be discarded.</p>
<p>We should consider these food-related common sense and cooking essentials to be most closely related to human health. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Congratulations and Get Rich</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Happily, the fifth day of the Lunar New Year arrives, a fine day for "welcoming the God of Wealth," so everyone should be smiling and saying, "Congratulations and get rich!"</p>
<p>Some might say that "Congratulations and get rich" is too vulgar. Do you not know that refined people of old referred to copper coins as "that thing"? Furthermore, as proof from the legacy of the most holy teacher, there is the saying, "The Master rarely spoke of profit." It's even easier with Mencius – the very first chapter, "Mencius Meets King Hui of Liang," states after only a few sentences, "Only benevolence and righteousness should be spoken of; why must profit be mentioned!" Why is it that in this New Year's article, you have thoroughly and authentically fulfilled those four words, "Once said, it becomes vulgar?"</p>
<p>And so, I must defend myself. It is also a matter of "helplessness."</p>
<p>Let's start with the sages. Confucius is truly respectable and lovable. Just look at those four words, "rarely spoke of profit": "Rarely spoke" does not mean "did not speak," it merely means he didn't have "Congratulations and get rich" on his lips all day long. If one only chooses to say "Congratulations and get rich" to friends during the New Year, wouldn't that be extremely in line with the meaning of "rarely speaking," and perfectly in accordance with the sage's intent? Mencius, when making fun of the people of Qi, already showed a bit of snobbery, and his rank belonged to the "sub" level, his position equivalent to Truman when Roosevelt was alive. There's no need for detailed refutation – you must know that King Hui of Liang was, after all, the ruler of a country, and it was indeed unbecoming for him to immediately seek benefits upon meeting this "old man." However, Mencius's exceptional eagerness upon hearing this precisely reflects the "old man's" sensitivity to the word "profit."</p>
<p>Let's return to discussing Confucius.</p>
<p>Those four words, "rarely spoke of profit," are truly wonderful—the more one thinks about it, the more wonderful they become, their meaning endless. "Rarely speaking" means "not often saying it out loud." What about in the heart? If we think about it from the opposite perspective, we will suddenly realize something. You must know that the opposite of "rarely" is "often," and the opposite of "speaking" is "thinking"!</p>
<p>The reason Confucius is not only respectable but also lovable is precisely because he showed in every way that he was not a "god" with unexpected and unimaginable powers, but a "person"—a "person" who could face reality squarely, possessed a very approachable personality, and had keen wisdom and wit. Why do American businessmen bring up "Confucius said..." when making advertisements? Why does no one pay attention to those solemn-faced Zhou Dunyi, Zhu Xi, or the Cheng brothers? The answer is: the common people under heaven (Man in the street) think similarly. We may have to pay lip service to those solemn-faced great men and gentlemen, but in our hearts, we truly dislike them. We want to get close to those who are willing to get close to us – Confucius is one of them.</p>
<p>The talent of the ancient Chinese in advertising is not inferior to that of Hollywood filmmakers. To persuade people to read, they would say: in books, there are "golden houses," "thousands of bushels of grain," and even "jade-like beauties"! Not only did they deeply understand the sages' intentions regarding the two key points of "food" and "sex," but they even seemed to have a premonition of the housing problem. No wonder some people are willing to risk becoming severely nearsighted and study by reflecting the snow, while others are not afraid of suspicion of theft and steal light by peering at the wall, and still others force open their sleepy eyes and stab their own thighs!</p>
<p>How much would a "golden house" cost to build? How much are "thousands of bushels of grain" worth? And the grey overcoat of a "jade-like beauty" cannot be spared either – otherwise, this "beauty" will be less like "jade" and more like "iron"...</p>
<p>Therefore, reading is a tool, while getting rich is the goal, the principle is extremely clear—"speaking" only once a year can be called "rarely speaking," and so I cannot help but express my thoughts as above.</p>
<h3>Toscanini</h3>
<p>— Cheng Juntão</p>
<p>The now immensely popular Italian musician Arturo Toscanini has recently been appointed as a senator by the Italian President Nicola. According to the new Italian constitution, the president can appoint five Italian celebrities from the fields of science, sociology, art, and literature as lifetime senators. Toscanini's new appointment is truly a grand event in the art world.</p>
<p>Toscanini was born on March 25, 1867, in the music-rich city of Parma, Italy. His father was a tailor, and his mother was not a musician, but Toscanini possessed musical genius. From the age of nine, he studied cello at the local music academy, and when he graduated at eighteen, he received an honorary diploma. Afterwards, he participated in performances with various small orchestras.</p>
<p>Toscanini had an exceptionally strong memory for songs. This, combined with his diligence, was the main factor contributing to his later achievements. Once, just hours before the opera "Aida" was to be performed, the orchestra conductor suddenly had a disagreement with the manager and refused to conduct. At that time, the manager accepted a suggestion from an orchestra member and asked Toscanini to serve as the temporary conductor. Toscanini's performance was greatly praised by the audience. At that time, he was only nineteen years old. Afterwards, Toscanini rose rapidly, becoming a world-class conductor. Today, he is hailed as the king of conductors.</p>
<p>In fact, Toscanini is not only an artist with extremely high musical attainments, but also a warrior with a great personality, a love of freedom, and a sense of justice. He hated the Fascists and was unmoved by their coercion and inducements. They had repeatedly forced him to conduct and perform Fascist songs, but he resolutely refused and was even beaten for it. However, this only strengthened his determination to oppose Fascism.</p>
<p>In 1938, all of Italy was in the clutches of Fascism. Toscanini could no longer stay in his homeland. For the sake of the country's future and for the sake of art, Toscanini tearfully went to work in the United States again. Toscanini not only brought sublime European music to America, but also brought the determination of millions of Italian compatriots to fight for justice and freedom to that land of freedom, arousing resonance among the entire American people. Wherever he went, he was warmly welcomed. When this silver-haired artist stood on the conductor's podium of a concert hall or opera house, conducting the performance of music, the audience below, the orchestra he conducted, and the choir all felt it was an supreme honor.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the United Nations organization, the U.S. State Department, in order to conduct grand publicity, asked Toscanini for assistance to shoot a music short film—"The United Nations Anthem." Toscanini adapted the United Nations Anthem into a moving song, conducted and performed by Toscanini, with the elite of choirs from all over the United States serving as the chorus, and the orchestra also assembled outstanding members from various orchestras. The magnificent music and moving songs left a lasting and profound impression on tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>This elderly artist, already eighty years old, is truly vigorous in his old age. Last May, Toscanini was specially invited to return to his country to perform pro bono, raising donations to aid refugees; afterwards, he took the orchestra to London to perform, shaking all of England. Toscanini is currently still the principal conductor of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) Symphony Orchestra, and he is still continuing to work hard to study music.</p>
<h3>On the "Hero" Tojo</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Some foreign reporters and Japanese people have expressed great surprise and even admiration for Tojo's eloquent defense of the Japanese Emperor and Japanese militarists at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and his "candid" admission that he "personally" was willing to bear the responsibility for Japan's defeat, while denying that Japan was the instigator of the war. According to reports from Tokyo, the Japanese people's aversion to Tojo in the past two years has now changed, and they believe that although Tojo is a loser, he is still a "hero," or at least a "good man."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, more than two years after Japan's surrender and before a formal peace treaty has even been established, Tojo has once again become a hero or a good man in the eyes of some Japanese people. And ironically enough, the location of the international tribunal that is being used by Tojo to create his "heroic" background is precisely the location of the "Imperial General Headquarters" where Tojo was in charge and directing the "Greater East Asia Holy War" three years ago!</p>
<p>Hitler's fate remains a mystery to this day, and Mussolini, after his body was once seized by his loyal followers, has long been secretly buried by the Italian authorities. Tojo's position in Japan in the past may not have been as high as that of Hitler and Mussolini, but compared to Goering and Ribbentrop, who were executed by the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, he is much luckier, because he is not only still alive today, but is also using the international tribunal that holds his ultimate fate in its hands to relive his "heroic" dream.</p>
<p>But can Tojo really be considered a "hero"? Judging heroes by success or failure is perhaps not the way of the wise; for example, a figure like Napoleon is a typical failed hero in an individualistic society, because although his ambition was defeated, the evaluations of him by historians and biographers can still evoke some feelings of regret.</p>
<p>But Tojo is definitely not this kind of character. Not to mention that Tojo attempted suicide with a pistol out of fear of punishment at the beginning of Japan's surrender, just seeing him still wearing a copper ring on his middle finger today in the Tokyo court is enough to show what kind of "hero" he is. According to Tojo himself, the reason he wears that string ring (actually just a string looped around his finger) is because he is easily angered, but as long as he sees that string ring, he can restrain himself. Examining his psychology, it is similar to the psychology of the shop assistants or nannies we often see wearing a rubber band on their fingers to indicate that they are abstaining from gambling or playing flower games!</p>
<p>However, these are minor matters. In fact, judging from the character of the Japanese people and their historical background, Japan is by no means a country that can easily produce true heroes. This is not to say that Japan lacks brave and scheming (some of the necessary conditions for a hero) figures; there are plenty of such figures in Japanese history, but it is because the Japanese usually lack romantic feelings and grand aspirations. The Japanese can become one of the most adaptable people in the world, but they are definitely not an ideal breeding ground for heroes. And it is even more out of the question to talk about people like Tojo!</p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration, Japan once wanted to learn from Europe and the United States, but the Japanese nation and society had their own limitations, so they finally hit a wall; then there was the so-called "Showa Restoration," and at that time, the "model" was German and Italian fascism; in fact, the content of the "Showa Restoration" was more suitable for the character of the Japanese nation than the "Meiji Restoration," but it was also destroyed under the wheels of the atomic age.</p>
<p>Today's Japan is naturally in the custody of the United States, and to say imitation is not so much as flattery; because it is imitation, everything seems unnatural, because it is flattery, everything contains an intention. And this two-in-one characteristic is precisely the essence of modern Japanese culture and its politics. A nation that is good at imitating and flattering in order to adapt to the environment is incapable of producing heroes with imaginative and creative personalities; on the contrary, it is a breeding ground for Machiavellians and opportunists.</p>
<p>Tojo's "eloquence" at the Tokyo International Tribunal, and the Japanese people who regard such an artful Tojo as a "hero," all express the opportunism of the Japanese nation! The Japanese nation also has its strengths and advantages, but unfortunately it is still immersed in the dream of opportunism. The Japanese people with two-sided personalities, tacitly acknowledged by Sato Haruo, still form the mainstream of today's Japanese culture and society.</p>
<h3>Unrestrained Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six Such a Wonderful Night (32)</p>
<p>After Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai finished drinking a cup of wine, she sighed slightly and said, "I am full of emotion, but since birth, I have never expressed my feelings to anyone. After seeing you, my feelings are different from anyone else. That night I was forced at Shichahai and decided to commit suicide. Unexpectedly, I was rescued by you, and you did not despise me and could understand my hardships. I feel that you are my only confidant in my life. I talked to you in the park last time, leaves fall to the roots, and everyone should have a home. Like me, drifting around is like fallen leaves dancing in the air. I may fall into the mud or into a soft bed. With my current situation, many people are chasing me and want to get close to me, but I know their psychology very well. They don't really love me. They are holding on to the idea of ​​recreation and amusement, so I am only superficially perfunctory to them. Although I am only twenty-two years old this year, I have been running around outside for the past few years and have contacted many people. I have carefully studied everyone's psychology, and only you can understand my painstaking efforts." Zhu Zhai was very moved when he heard this and said, "I admire your art the most. You have been through all kinds of tribulations and can always strive for art. This is most admirable." Qi Wan said, "Don't say anything about admiration. I always feel that you are my only confidant. A confidant is the most difficult to find, so I don't treat you as an outsider and talk about everything. Because I am straightforward and outspoken, I suddenly talked about your marriage problem just now, but it has already become a fact, so there is no need to regret it. Don't let my words cause you any unhappiness." Seeing that Qi Wan had gently said a lot of words, she wanted to explain the marriage problem she had talked about. Maybe she saw all kinds of difficulties, so the meaning in her words changed from enthusiasm to plainness. This was because she was thinking too much. He hurriedly said, "It is because you think highly of me that you talked about the problem, which is also the most difficult problem for me. I am extremely painful about this matter!" Seeing Zhu Zhai frowned when he said this, knowing that he was sad, Qi Wan said, "Let's not talk about this matter now, let's have two more drinks!" She first drank the glass of wine in front of her. Zhu Zhai also accompanied her with a glass, shaking his head and saying, "I have not had a happy day since I got married, let alone now. Just say that today is my birthday. Others must go back and have a gathering with their family. I am not because you are leaving. I would rather spend my birthday outside alone than come back." Qi Wan was slightly startled and said, "Today is your birthday! In that case, I hurriedly prepared a few bowls of simple dishes. I originally wanted to make it a farewell banquet for you and me, but I didn't want to celebrate your birthday for you. Okay, I should respect you with three cups!" She stood up and brought the wine glass to let Zhu Zhai drink. Zhu Zhai stretched out his hand and gently pressed her shoulder and said, "Please sit down! It is no problem for me to drink a few cups, but you have already drunk a lot. I advise you not to drink anymore. Your voice is important!" Qi Wan still held up the glass and stood saying, "It doesn't matter, I still have something to say to you after you drink." Zhu Zhai had no choice but to stand up and take the wine from her hand and drink it. Qi Wan also accompanied him with three cups, pulled him to sit down, and took off a pearl-studded pin from her close-fitting collar and pinned it on Zhu Zhai's tie, smiling slightly, "Today is your birthday. I will give you this as a souvenir!"</p>
<h3>Ode to the New Year</h3>
<h3>Sun Yuehan</h3>
<p>Happy New Year, Happy New Year,</p>
<p>First kneel before the Bodhisattva's seat.</p>
<p>Prices of everything soar from eighth-grade wood,</p>
<p>New Year's people are older than last year!</p>
<p>Do not be heartbroken by unpacified war flames,</p>
<p>Who cares about the world's affairs like that.</p>
<p>All that is seen before one's eyes is selfish gorging,</p>
<p>The year of Mao has emptied the year of Yin's grain.</p>
<p>Most especially, the neighbor Wang Xiaoer,</p>
<p>A lone carrier seeking trifling profits.</p>
<p>The New Year is worse than the last, year after year,</p>
<p>Husband and wife face each other, shedding tears in cattle clothes!</p>
<p>Peach Blossom Spring starts building a high debt platform,</p>
<p>The cold wind at the end of the year is like scissors.</p>
<p>How can one allow wealthy families to violate thrift?</p>
<p>Willing to follow the powerful to learn fashion?</p>
<p>Firewood, rice, oil, and salt are especially thorny,</p>
<p>The appearance is as weary as a homeless dog.</p>
<p>Life is like a radish striking a golden gong,</p>
<p>The job title is a hunchback flipping somersaults!</p>
<p>Alas, alas, times are difficult, the years are barren, and I am also barren,</p>
<p>Selling articles and paintings is doubly embarrassing.</p>
<p>In a dream, I hug the quilt and shout wildly:</p>
<p>I have picked up a way to ward off evil in the world!</p>
<p>(Note: "Eighth-grade wood" means rice. "Radish striking a golden gong" means one section is short, one section is long. "Hunchback flipping somersaults" means two ends not landing properly.)</p>
<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
<p>— Lei Ke</p>
<p>A plagiarism case has been resolved silently and inconspicuously (that is, compared to the Xiao Danggui case). What I am recording below, however, is an even more inconsequential trivial matter. I happened to talk about plagiarism with a person sitting on the sidelines, and he told me an interesting story about a classroom copycat, which would be a pity not to record.</p>
<p>Once, my friend saw a very good article in a student's composition book and was very proud. He circulated it to his colleagues in the teachers' lounge. When it was the turn of a Chinese teacher from another grade, he! Then he also flipped through the textbook left and right, and sure enough, he found the "original manuscript". Having eyes but not recognizing Mount Tai, it turned out to be an article by a vernacular warrior of the May Fourth era. My friend was very happy, as if someone had helped him catch a pickpocket. Immediately, he called the student over. But the student's face turned red, but said with equal surprise: "Why is it the same as what I wrote?" How could it be the same? He insisted on believing (or rather, insisted) that there was such a coincidence in the world, and when it came to this issue of faith, it was impossible to explain it any further.</p>
<p>My friend told me that there was a reason for this. Once, this student made a scene at the training office, saying that the physical education teacher slapped him. But the physical education teacher did not admit it. However, the student's face was so red that you could almost see "the palm of a giant spirit." The physical education teacher explained: "My hand just swung out like this, and his face just turned over like this. Naturally, the two sides could not avoid touching like this." There is such a coincidence in the world, the training director naturally held the same firm belief as the teacher, and the student had no choice but to retreat silently. This lesson was not without benefit to him, and the above was the first time it came into play.</p>
<h3>Final Accounting of the Eastern Legation Quarter</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The land and real estate of the Dongjiaomin Lane were officially handed over by the Chinese and foreign responsible authorities before the new year. On the Chinese side were the Mayor of Peiping and the Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and on the foreign side were five advisors, namely the consuls of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The location was the West Flower Hall of the Municipal Government, at 3:00 PM on December 26th of the 36th year of the Republic of China. The historical significance is quite significant and deserves special attention.</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called "Legation Quarter" of Dongjiaomin Lane ceased to exist four years ago. Although China has taken it back after the restoration, the completion of the formalities and the settlement of everything before that date began on this day and at this time.</p>
<p>The area east of Zhengyang Gate, west to Chongwen Gate, north to Chang'an Street, and south to the city wall was originally inhabited by both Chinese and foreign officials and civilians before the Gengzi Incident. Although there were many foreign legations and overseas merchants, there were also many Chinese official residences and the residences of influential figures. The residence of Xu Tong, a grand scholar and veteran of four dynasties (at that time known as Yin Xuan Xiangguo, the tutor of the Qing Tongzhi Emperor), was in the area. He was a scholar of Neo-Confucianism and deeply resented foreigners. Because his residence was close to the legations, he wrote eight characters on the door: "Sighing over Foreign Favor," "Living Next to Ghosts." Outside the gate, there was a pile of earth like a small mountain, formed by years of windblown sand and garbage. Superstitious people said it was good for the feng shui of the house, a sign of good fortune. The foreigners, however, thought it obstructed traffic and was unhygienic, so they started work to level it. Xu Tong could do nothing about it and hated the foreigners even more. The miscellaneous poems of the Gengzi Incident, "An old Taoist living in a foreign place, cherishing a pile of earth in front of his door," refer to this matter. Xu, a follower of Cheng and Zhu, had a solemn appearance and was known in scholarly circles as "Old Taoist Xu." Because he strongly supported the Boxers, he committed suicide by hanging himself after the Eight-Nation Alliance broke into Beijing, at the age of over eighty.</p>
<p>After the Gengzi Rebellion, the Qing government agreed to move all the government offices and civilian residences outside the area. This piece of land was then managed by the legations themselves. There was a rotating officer on duty at the top and self-managed police and post offices below. At first, they even forbade Chinese people from passing through, citing the reason of protecting the roads. Later, after negotiations with the Qing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they were given a subsidy of five thousand taels of silver each year for road repairs, and they obtained the "right of passage," but large carriages were still restricted. In the event of an incident, traffic would be cut off first. After the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, the city of Beijing was in a panic, and the Dongjiaomin Lane was placed under martial law, with the east, west, and north sides sealed off for several months. After that, during events such as the Restoration War, the Zhili-Anhui War, the two Zhili-Anhui Wars, and other disturbances, the Dongjiaomin Lane would immediately close its iron gates and protect itself. Its surrounding walls had gun emplacements, resembling battlements, with a solemn atmosphere. The city residents called it the "Foreign Forbidden City," even more imposing than the "Chinese Forbidden City" (the Forbidden City).</p>
<p>Because of several civil wars among the warlords, the flames of war reached the city, and the citizens were like startled birds. At the first sign of alarm, they rushed to the Dongjiaomin Lane to rent temporary houses to avoid disaster. But the foreigners said that this was different from the Legation Quarter and the Tianjin Concession, and the restrictions were extremely strict. Because there were many foreign firms and residences, except for the Six Nations Hotel and a few other hotels and hospitals, which had already been taken over, people could only resort to using the Western clerks to find ways. Even a single permanent house or a woodshed could fetch a high price. At that time, foreign firms also used safe deposit boxes, rented out by number, where valuable property could be deposited. Therefore, in times of chaos, the Dongjiaomin Lane was a gold mine. The city residents knew that they were spending money and being treated badly, but they had no choice. Moreover, this was only something merchants could do; ordinary people could only look on in envy.</p>
<p>The area east of Chongwen Gate, north to Dongdan Archway on the east city wall, was commonly called the "Protected Area," and formally known as "Second Dongjiaomin Lane." It was neither a concession nor a legation quarter. Although it was under Chinese police jurisdiction, there were foreign residences, foreign firms, hospitals, newspapers, hotels, and brothels. People of various countries lived scattered in the alleys, so it was full of foreign atmosphere. Moreover, because this area was in the east of the Legation Quarter and was located in a corner, even if there were military affairs in the suburbs, there was the "Foreign Forbidden City" to act as a screen, so the residents could "sleep soundly without worry." The price of houses and land in this area was four or five times more expensive than in other areas. Advertisements for sale or rent specifically marked the words "Within the Protected Area" as a reason for demanding high prices. In times of chaos, the house owners' hoarding and extortion were no different from those in the concessions. It was a strange phenomenon and a sad history, but now it has all become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Economically, since the large railway nationalization loan in the former Qing Dynasty, the large post-war loan in the Republic of China, and various other large and small loans, the "banking group" in the Legation Quarter was the center of it all. The British HSBC, the French Credit Lyonnais, and the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank all occupied a dominant position in the Chinese financial world. Those large buildings were also towering in Dongjiaomin Lane.</p>
<p>Politically, there was also the term "Diplomatic Corps," which was called the "Supreme Government" during the Beiyang government era. The losers of each coup, such as Zhang Xun who restored the Qing dynasty, hid in the Dutch legation, and the ten arch-criminals of the Anfu Clique, Liang Hongzhi, Xu Shuzheng, Zhu Shen, etc., all hid in the cellars of the Japanese barracks for years. Therefore, this area also became a place for fugitives.</p>
<p>In the two or three years after the July 7th Incident, the Japanese still had some scruples about the Legation Quarter. Until a year before the start of the Pacific War, they gradually provoked Britain and the United States. Until the outbreak of war, they occupied the British and American legations with their troops, and the officials of other countries were terrified under the evil flames for more than a year. Then, in the form of returning it, they handed it over to the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, but in reality it was still controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Now it is stipulated as a part of the municipal property under the jurisdiction of the Land Administration Bureau (the land within the quarter that various countries are allowed to continue to use for official purposes is subject to a new agreement). Thus, this special zone that symbolized "inequality" for fifty years has once again become the "clean land" of China. Its significance is even greater than the recovery of the concessions, which is something that anyone with a little historical knowledge can understand.</p>
