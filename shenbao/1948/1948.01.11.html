<h3>誤傳史達大病逝　一度引起京滬各界注視　路透社己自動更正並表歉意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕史達林病逝之說，自由瑞士京城伯爾尼傳出後，引起全球注意，然迄未證實，而莫斯枓亦持緘默。此間英文自由論壇報昨晨在第一版以大標題刊載「史達林已死」消息，消息來源爲路透社，內稱：「據路透社星期六晨二時半收聽莫斯科廣播宣佈史達林已逝世」。此訊一經發表，立即引起各界關注，結果經多方調查，此訊並不確實，而路透社當局則首先自動否認。據該社解釋：此訊之發出由於誤會，實囚該社一報務員誤讀一撕毀之無綫電報，以電話通知報館所起。其原電爲：「美國報章刊載國外發出之電訊稱，盛傳史達林元首已於莫斯科逝世」。但嗣後又接獲否認此訊之報吿。</p>
<p>路透社對此錯誤報道表示無限抱歉。至本市蘇聯官方對此並無任何表示，認爲此訊可由路透社本身否認。當昨日「史達林逝世消息」發表後，幾乎發生不少「啼笑皆非」之事，有某國外交人員閱報後，正擬赴蘇聯領事館投刺弔唁，經　員向報館探詢不確始作罷。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十日電〕京市「新中華日報」十日下午二時出版號外，報吿史達林逝世之消息。號外第一版幾全部刊載史氏之報吿，附有其生平詳歷，並稱謠傳史氏染病已數月於茲。該報稱史氏於十日上午二時半（莫斯科時間）逝世。消息來源為「上海電」，對於逝世詳情及上海如何接獲此消息亦略而不載。</p>
<p>此間下午三時收聽莫斯科電台廣播，並無有關史氏之消息。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕蘇駐平代總領事齊赫文，對盛傳史達林患右半身麻痺疾說，加以否認，謂此係惡意造謠，並稱：今年元旦史氏曾電蔣主席致賀，可為反證</p>
<h3>平市定為陪都　北方人民感奮　何思源稱決努力建設</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕國務會議明定北平爲陪都後，何思源市長發表談話稱：北平爲軍事，政治，經濟樞紐，尤爲遠東文化中心，今政府明定北平爲陪都，足徵重視北方之至意。想華北人民聞之亦同感興奮。在此戡亂時期，北平使命尤爲重大，我們應更加團結，更加努力，更加警惕，以完成北平應盡之任務。本市都市計劃，向以建設北平具有現代化首都條件爲目標，今後當本此目標努力邁進，使北平由陪都進而爲首都，微諸中國近代史實，凡以北平爲首都，均爲大亂以後，相信政府此次明定北平爲陪都，亦將爲國家將獲統一之徵兆，願與華北同胞共勉之。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕平參議會議長許惠東稱：國務會議通過定北平爲陪都，足使北方人民感舊，雖謂空洞，而影響甚佳，現應將北平仍改稱北京，該會決於明日電呈中央建議。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕胡適說，聽到國務會議通過定北平為陪都，我非常高興，希望將來至少每年南京夏熱時能把政治中心搬到北平三四個月。</p>

<h3>戡亂期間節流不易　政府决着重開源　徐柏園談整頓稅收辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕財次徐柏　談：政府決心平衡收支，惟以戡亂軍事及共匪破壞節流不易，故着重開源，主要自整頓稅收着手。整頓稅收之策有四：　按物價變動情形收稅，如貨物稅過去每三個月調整一次，現則改為每月調整一次。　實行預征辦法，如所得稅等，將仿英國預征辦法，以後再行結算。　調整關稅，除正稅限於國際關稅協定，不能變更外，附加稅將自百分之五增至百分之五十。此外，如汽油，柴油，煤油，戰時曾予免稅，現亦恢復征收。　希望立院授權政院·財部得按物價上漲情形隨時調整稅率。關於地方財政，過去諸多困難，由中央補助者，達百分之八十二以上，今年起加緊整頓田賦，其中原歸由央部份（百分之卅）改劃歸省方，充裕地方財源，同時整頓地方稅收，如營業稅劃歸地方後征收情形欠佳，今後當切實整頓，使收入增多，如此，地方財政情形好轉。中央即可不再補助，總之，不論有無外援，稅收之整頓，均為當前急務，稅收有成績財政如能上軌道，否則使改革幣制，而收支依然不能平衡，新幣發行後，財政亦無法穩定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕田賦收入劃歸省縣問題，業經國務會議通過，茲悉其實施期將在行憲肇始後，因糧食年度係自每年九月起至次年之八月底止，目前征收者尙係去年之田賦，故此項辦法之實行，自在行憲以後矣，又田賦劃歸地方後，糧部之職責仍績有調節民食，統籌軍糧之重任，故在機構組織上，不致不所變動。</p>
<h3>五市擴大配糧三月間可開始</h3>

<h3>九龍城拆屋問題港府作片面解釋　葉公超昨曾與港督商談</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港十日電〕香港政府今日發表聲明，解釋拆除九龍舊城區之木屋，係爲保障港九居民之健康及生命。港政府一年餘以來，即從事移除區內各地佔據王地居民之政策，以彼等有碍公共衛生故也。此次在九龍採取之程序，即係本於此一政策。港當局在執行前，曾給予佔住者以適當的通知，並曾告以遷居之處，鼓勵其聲請新居。在執行遷移令時，並未使用武力，亦僅有一人因房屋倒下而受輕傷。</p>

<h3>改革幣制擬妥計劃　分匯兌用銀本位兩部份由貝祖詒携美商討決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕改革幣制問題，傳說已久，近始具體化。據極可靠消息，財部已將幣制改革之具體計劃擬妥，呈請蔣主席核閱。該項計劃，將交由貝祖詒氏携赴美國，與美財政界人士及貨幣專家詳加研究，蓋幣制若決定實行改革，勢非籍美國之援助不為功。觀察家指出，隨貝氏赴美人員中，有貨幣專家朱葆貞，足證貝氏此行，負有與美方研究乃至談判請美協助改革幣制之任務。此間政府官員對目前物價不斷上漲，即法幣不斷貶值之問題，感認欲挽救此種危機，祗有改革幣制一途，故各方僉盼貝氏此行能在幣制方面獲得成就。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕財政界有資格人士頃對改革幣制問題談稱：我政府對改革幣制之計劃，約可分為以匯兌為本位及銀本位兩部份，但究竟將以何種方式以改革幣制，將視美援而決定。此次我由貝氏携美之遍計劃，即係兩種方式具備，俟抵美後，視美方採用之何項方式決定。如採匯兌本位，則美將貸我三億以上之美元，以充作外匯基金即可，如為銀行本位，似亦有可能為美方採納，因美折銀過剩。同時，國庫存銀甚多，且如將來我仍使用銀幣，則更可恢復過去銀元之信用。美如採納銀本位方式，則當貸我相等於三億美元之白銀，故將來究採何種方式，端視美援華之事實以決定之。</p>

<h3>美援華細節擬就馬歇爾候晤兪貝　貨幣問題待最後決定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日在記者招待會宣稱：本人擬與中國技術代表俞大維及貝祖詒二人親自會談，以便諮詢美國援華事宜。國務部謂：俞·貝兩氏可望於本星期　到華盛頓，但中國大使館則稱或將稍緩，何時到達，尙難逆料。馬氏並稱：美政府援華計劃，自四月份起十五個月內或需經費約三億元，細節業經擬就，現待最後決定。了後決定與政府其他部門有關，且係復雜之貨幣問題。或問援華計劃中來回能在數星期內　付國會討論，馬氏答稱：恐不容稽延如此之久。</p>

<h3>法幣眞實價值之研究</h3>
<p>— 張白衣</p>
<p>自抗戰後期以迄今日，中國法幣價值逐漸陷於長期的低落；又因大都市投機市塲的存在，少數奸　有意囤積居奇的現象的存在，以及多數民衆無意居奇而爭購不必要或不急要物資的行爲的存在，使法幣價值問題　陷於混亂。</p>
<p>迄至最近爲止，物價平均較戰前增加十二萬至十三萬倍，換言之，即戰前法幣一元，約等於今日法幣十二萬至十三萬元。此種標準，是否合理？實在大有問題。</p>
<p>我人如果依據貨幣數量　說（Quantitative　Theory　of　Moncy），來研究今日法幣眞正之價值，所得的結論，自必否定今日法幣之價值標準。因爲今日法幣雖陷於通貨膨脹狀態而價值逐漸貶降，但其貶值的程度，決非低落到如今日市塲的標準。</p>
<p>經濟學者黃元彬近在廣州發表談話，自去年十月前後，法幣發行數量每加一倍，則物價漲至十倍，故物價高漲的原因，大體說來，十之一由於法幣增發，十之九則由於人民的不信法幣。的確依據筆者研究，今日法幣市塲價值如此低降，實由於國民心理狀態對法幣儘量壓迫而來。假使全國國民對法幣心理能有所改變以，則法幣的價值決不會陷於如此之低落。</p>
<p>我們現研究法幣的眞實價值（Real　Value）必先明暸下面兩種數字：</p>
<p>一·由國民政府抗戰以來歷年國家財政的赤字額累計數，而推算法幣發行量的總額若干。</p>
<p>二·由世界第二次大戰前後各國——特別與中國經濟關係較密的各國通貨流通額數字，而衡量今日中國法幣對外匯率的眞正標準。</p>
<p>我們如能獲得上述二個主要的眞實數字，則自即可以衡量今日法幣之眞實價值。</p>
<p>第一，先來看國民政府抗戰以來國家財政的赤字額，依據各項資料統計所得如後：</p>
<p>（單位法幣百萬元）</p>
<p>民國二十六年　四九五·九三六</p>
<p>民國二十七年（半年）　三九五·六五〇</p>
<p>民國二十八年　一，三八三·一八〇</p>
<p>民國二十九年　四，〇〇七·一五六</p>
<p>民國三十年　九，〇一三·五九九</p>
<p>民國三十一年　一九，七七七·〇三四</p>
<p>民國三十二年　一二，九九四·〇四五</p>
<p>民國三十三年　五三，八九六·一五六</p>
<p>民國三十四年　七二，二四五·七一一</p>
<p>民國三十五年　九三九，一一三·四四三</p>
<p>民國三十六年　二二，六〇〇，〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>（附注：民國二十六年至民國三十二年係依據財政部國庫實收實支數字·民國三十三年至民國三十五年係據金融日報。民國三十六年係據最近報載）。</p>
<p>依據上表所示，我國自民國二十六年至民國三十六年止，十一年來財政赤字額累計爲二十三兆七千一百三十三億二千一百九十一萬元。（注：萬億日兆）。此數額係歷年國家財政的虧空額，其中雖有一部份已由公債彌補，但以數目不多，爲簡便計算起見，我們即可以此數認爲十一年來中央銀行國庫　款的累計額，也即可認爲中央銀行十一年來發行法幣之累計額。</p>
<p>抗戰前我國法幣發行量爲十四億元，加上歷年發行累計，則可推算民國三十六年終我國法幣流通額約爲二十三兆七千一百四十七億二千一百九十一萬元。</p>
<p>戰前法幣發行額爲十四億元，已發前述，今日爲二十三兆七千一百四十七億元，其增加的倍數約爲一萬七千倍。假定我人依據通貨數量來換算戰前法幣的眞實價值，則今日法幣一萬七千元宜可等於戰前法幣一元。但依據今日特價來看，比戰前約增加十二萬至十三萬倍，是則戰前法幣一元將等於今日法幣十二萬至十三萬元。其間距離之大，由此可以證明；也就可以指出今日人民心理過於低估法幣價值之不當。</p>
<p>第二，再來看世界第二次大戰前後主要國家通貨流通類，依據聯合國統計月報（Monthly　Bulletin　of　Statistics.）報吿，美國通貨流通額一九三七年約爲六十億美元，至一九四七年八月約爲二百七十一億美元。英國同期間由五億〇五百萬英鎊增至十三億九千三百萬英鎊。印度同期間由十八億盧比增至一百十八億盧比。法國同期間由九百四十億法郎增至八千三百二十億法郎。加拿大同期間由二億〇七百萬加元增至十億〇〇八百萬加元。澳洲同期間由五千四百萬澳鎊增至二億〇六百萬澳鎊。此即表示各國在最近比到戰前一九三七年，美國通貨流通額約增加三倍半。英國約增加一又四分之三倍。印度約增加五倍又半。法國增加約八倍。加拿大約增加四倍。澳洲約增加三倍。</p>
<p>其中特別值得注意的爲美國通貨流通額，因目前美國與中國經濟關係最爲密切，同時又是世界經濟領導國，戰時及戰後我國人民爭購美鈔之風又甚盛，我國外匯又往往依據美匯爲標準。但美國通貨實際的購買力因流通額增加而減低，關於此一事實，似未爲我國一般人民所注意。茲將美國聯邦準備月報（Fedcral　Reserve　Bulletin，September　1947）所報吿的美國通貨流通額詳細統計列表如後：</p>
<p>美國　幣及小額通貨流通額統計（單位百萬美元）</p>
<p>美國大額通貨流通額統計（單位百萬美元）</p>
<p>（本表依據Fedcral　Restrve　Bulletin　September1947）</p>
<p>依據上表所示，可知美國通貨流通額在一九四七年八月終爲二百八十一億四千九百萬美元，比一九三七年終之六十五億五千萬美元，約增加三倍又三分之一倍。如果除去　幣，則爲由六十億〇一千三百萬美元增至二百六十七億九千三百萬美元，即增加約三倍半。其中特別值得注意的爲大額券比小額券增加的速率較大，以一九四七年八月終比一九三七年終，美鈔壹元券貳元券及五元券的增加約一倍，但拾元券增加三倍，念元券增加五倍，伍拾元券增加約五倍半，百元券增加約六倍，伍百元券增加約二倍，千元券增加約二倍。即由拾元券至千元券之增加率比一元至五元增加率平均尤約增四倍。一九四七年由拾元至千元券的過去流通額共計爲二百三十六億七千六百萬美元，比一九三七年的上述諸券流通額四十五億五千四百萬美元，增加四倍有餘。美國有通貨膨脹的事實存在，即此可以證明</p>
<p>由於美國通貨膨脹的結果，美國物價及生活費指數當然隨之上升。據美國勞働部勞働統計爲（Bureau　of　Labour　Statistics　Depurt　of　Labour）發表，美國生活費指數由一九三七年的一〇〇·八增至一九四七年六月的一五七·一。而其中糧食則由一〇五·三增至一九四七年七月的一九三二，衣　同期間由一〇二·八增至一八五·七。（以一九三七—三九年平均爲一〇〇）同時據美國聯邦準備月報刋載美國批發物價指數，以一九四七年七月比一九三七年，計農產品由八六增至一八一，糧食由八六增至一六二，其他商品由八五增至一三四。（一九二六年爲一〇〇）</p>
<p>是以吾人如由美國通貨流通數量推算，今日美鈔一元應僅等於戰前美金二角半，如以物價推算，今日美鈔一元僅等於戰前五角。依筆者折衷推算，今日美金一元約等於戰前美金三角三分。戰前我國法幣約三元換美元一元，故今日美金一元約等於我國戰前法幣一元。我國今日法幣的眞實價值應爲一萬七千元約合戰前法幣一元，故今日法幣一萬七千元實際合今日美金一元。</p>
<p>由此可知，由我國法幣發行量來衡量法幣之眞實價值，將是今日法幣一萬七千元等於戰前法幣一元。由美國通貨流通量來衡量法幣之眞實價值，將是今日法幣一萬七千元等於今日的美金一元。亦即今日美元三元等於戰前美元一元，因戰前我國法幣三元對美元爲一元，故今日美元一元實等於我國戰前法幣一元。</p>
<p>然而今日爲何法幣對美元之匯率，平準基金會竟掛高至九萬法幣對一美元？而何以黑市匯率則更超過此數甚還？同時又爲何我國物價增高之倍數又竟達十二三萬倍之多？</p>
<p>依筆者研究所得，促成此種不合理的現象的不在於中國法幣的本身，而是國民對於法幣之不加信任。這眞是國民自毀經濟的致命傷！因爲大多數人民不相信法幣能够安定，因之均不能如戰前儲蓄之習慣而以有餘所得存入於銀行，於量法幣流通額可說全部漫遊於市塲，而流通速度更遠過於尋常。法幣漫遊市塲的結果，必然是物資在市塲存在量之逐漸減少。由於法幣流通額與市塲物資存在量兩者間距離之巨大，以致造成物價刻刻上升，時時波動，使法幣購買力更見天天減少，而步步墮下惡性通貨膨脹的深淵！</p>
<p>事實如此：戰前法幣流通額十四億元，而銀行存款却始终保持二十六億元左右。但今日法幣流通額第二十三兆，但商業行莊存款反而低到僅二三兆元，連四家行局在內，亦恐不過十餘兆元；而且其中大半爲短期存款，事實上可說並無定期存款及儲蓄存款。</p>
<p>同時，美鈔本身已因通貨膨脹致逐漸貶值其三分之二，而流浪於中國的美鈔却因中國人民之紛紛購儲，反而無形中協助美國貨幣在中國特殊之優越地位。依據中央銀行發表，上　手持美鈔者，其總數已較戰前增加十倍。但美鈔數額之十倍，其實際價值僅比戰前增多三倍半，因爲今日美鈔比戰前美鈔貶值三分之二。</p>
<p>此外更值得注意者，爲中國富有階級紛紛將法幣變爲外幣而逃往海外，遠者美國，近者香港，亦爲削弱法幣價值之一大原因。這些人都是國家的蟊賊！</p>
<p>我們要保持法幣的安定，以及恢復其價值，事實並不困難。茲建議幾個辦法如後：</p>
<p>政府必須立刻宣布財政收支平衡原則，此後必須對富有者重徵課稅及勸募公債，絕不依賴發行而彌補其赤字，同時力行此原則，最後重新厲行中央銀行發行檢查制度，由社會法團參加，隨時公開報吿。</p>
<p>政府積極獎勵人民儲蓄，命令國家行局庫利用種種方法，吸收大量定期存款。</p>
<p>政府厲行外匯管理，絕對禁止美鈔及其他外幣之交易，並宣吿外匯收回國有，包括一切在外存款。（按戰時英國曾宣行外匯國有。）</p>
<p>政府於必要時，宣吿國際貿易全歸國營。</p>
<p>政府設置物價評定委員會，物價一致核定，至少一個月中不得變動。</p>
<p>人民絕對服從政府命令，以所得有餘不作購買不必要或不急要物資或美鈔黃金而將其餘款一律存儲於國家銀行。</p>
<p>人民絕對服從政府命令，凡可換外匯之一切外國貨幣及黃金，全依官價結留於政府。（戰時英國曾宣行此制）。</p>
<p>人民對政府規定物價，一律不得自由變更。</p>
<p>如果政府與人民眞正合作，政府不視人民全爲奸商，人民亦不視官吏全爲貪污，彼此信任合作，則物價必能平穩。物價平穩後，政府才能準備幣制改革。政府對於新貨幣對法幣的換兌率，必須對於國家銀行定期存款及儲蓄存款的存戶予以特別優待。例如：假定每十萬法幣合一新幣者，對儲蓄存款的存戶則不妨以五萬法幣合一新幣，（最近蘇聯改革幣制即行此法），如此則更可鼓勵人民在幣制改革前踴躍儲蓄，加速法幣的安定。</p>
<p>總之，我國在目前雖內亂未定，但我國現在生產力比戰前已增加甚多。同時因資源豐富之東北及台灣收回以後，我國物資存儲是亦比戰前增大十倍而有餘。同時我國人口有五億左右，其中至少有一億二千五百萬人爲主要勞働力，倘產業技術問題解決，中國決無貪窮的顧慮。人力物力爲國富活力的基本泉源，中國有此巨大人力物力，何患貧困？所以筆者希望政府先有賢明的財政政策與經濟政策，與公忠體國之國民，眞誠合作，切實興行，中國法幣自可挽救，而中國經濟的前途更不一定是令人悲觀的。</p>

<h3>美艦艇多艘移讓土耳其　韃靼海峽增强防務　阻遏共產勢力伸入地中海</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛顿九日電〕美国今日支特　靼尼爾海峽防務，以艦隊式潛艇四艘移讓土耳其。外加其他兵　十一艘，特別適宜於該一中東軍略區城之任務。按　隊式艦艇乃巨型新式潛艇，潛航力極長，有角　　放射　十具，艇員可載六十五人。本星期中美國舊　供給土耳其希臘艦隊調遺者已達三十三艘。海軍部今日此項宣布，乃一連串電事外交行動之高潮，在使蘇聯與其巴　幹附屬各國知曉任何行動，凡足以改變該一展史上「火　庫」區域之均勢者，勢必引起嚴重後果。海軍部新　處長　森少將最近亦謂，美國艦隊乃本國外交政策之後盾。美海　隊　隊一千名携帶充分登陸配備，正開往地中海方面增援，前海軍軍令部參謀長休曼海軍中將將於下月就任地中海艦隊總司令之職，駐節强大航空母艦「中途島」號上。今日供給土耳其之潛艇將由美海軍人員幫駛開往土港，其他　艇計有掃雷艦八艘，及敷網船，汕船修理船各一艘，則將由在人訓練之土耳其水手　駛。希臘今日亦得砲　六艘，先是國務院宣布已以　雷　十一艘售予希臘。各　之讓與均包括在國會去年通過之四億五千萬元援助希土方案內。土耳其獲得新潛艇四艘後，其潛艇實力亦僅十四艘，較之蘇聯之二百十五艘仍渺乎其小。蘇聯　隊之實際佈防情形，　守秘密，但專家謂其主力集中於海參崴，波羅的海與黑海亦有强大艦隊。美國　與土耳其之潛艇，並無長時間潛水設備，但韃靼尼爾與黑海距離甚短，此種設備並非必要。美海軍專家告記者稱，潛艇之主要用途，除向蘇聯示意外，將進一步訓練土耳其水手，此等潛艇可以阻碍敵方之述輸，几能行駛長程，故適於巡邏工作。</p>
<h3>美關心希臘局勢　地中海艦隊作十日操演</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典十日電〕美大使館昨日宣布：美地中海　隊包括四萬五千噸航空母艦「中途島」號輕巡洋艦三艘及　逐　若干，於星期三起在東地中海及希臘西南之伊沃寗海開始作例有的訓練操演，預定至一月十六日爲止。星期一日美國啓程之陸戰隊一千名不久將派至各該艦服務。</p>
<p>據美方報吿稱，美國此等行動，實爲對希臘鄰邦警告，囑其不得承認馬柯斯之「自由希臘政府」。據本社外交記者稱，芙陸戰隊之派遣，乃華盛頓表示於必要時，不惜使用武力之傳統信號。按兩日以前，美國務部曾訓令其駐南斯拉夫及保加利亞之代表，警吿兩國政府不得承認馬柯斯之政府，聲明此等行動將被認爲運背聯合國憲章之原則。據希政府昨日所接情報，謂共產國際情報局最近曾討論邀請希共參加該局，以代替立即承認馬柯斯政府，想此乃由於英美態度之堅決及希遊擊隊未能佔得相當土地之故。</p>
<h3>美否認要求派兵赴聖地</h3>

<h3>關於荷蘭印尼紛爭：海牙朝野意見</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>〔本報特派員海牙航訊〕際此印尼問題大感棘手之際，海牙朝野對保護印尼華僑生命財產一事，表示異常關切。荷蘭政府殖民部（現已改稱海外部）發言人弗拉斯傳士，以旅居印尼十四年之資格，對本報記者歷述南洋華僑對渠之深厚友情。渠稱：「南洋羣島之開發，中國僑民有最偉大之貢獻，荷政府決不能忽略視之」。弗氏助手海尼根，出示印尼共和國暴徒殘殺華僑之照相及巴達維亞中華總會致荷蘭政府之盡翰，證明印尼共和國之種種無紀律狀態。海尼根稱：「荷蘭政府派遣軍隊至東印度羣島，純爲維持治安與保議善良人民之安全」。渠堅決否認彼此有所謂戰爭。「荷蘭僅有十萬人馬在印尼，此區區之數目，決不能勝任　服印尼之戰爭，其理至　」。</p>
<p>但海尼根仍謂：荷蘭政府有把握於兩星期內進軍日惹（印尼共和和和國首都），但荷政府不忍出此，蓋『縱然進軍日惹，問題並不能因此獲得解決』。渠對本報記者詳述印尼共和國過去與日本法西斯勾結之因果，以及今日暗中與蘇俄之秘密關係。海氏且遵照荷關政府之統一宣傳方針，劃分舊荷屬東印度羣爲為三個部份，即：　印尼共和國，包括蘇門答臘與爪哇。　婆羅洲。　西里伯斯與東印尼小島聯邦。渠稱：當前蘇門答臘與爪哇之紛擾，僅爲印尼共和國之野蠻行爲，與婆羅洲與印尼東部小島無關，「因後兩者之政治主張，完全與荷政府相合』。此類主張，即：由三個分立部份，共同組織『印尼合衆國』此一印尼合衆國，有外交及國防權，　有獨立自主之政府。記者詢以；此理想之合衆國，將來與荷閘本國之關係？海尼根謂目前荷政府尙無　案，但渠深信可能如加拿大之於英國。</p>
<p>本報記者於聖誕前夜目巴黎抵　海牙，時荷關首相畢爾博士，與殖民部長勞工部長聯袂飛赴東印度，荷蘭朝野咸認印尼科紛一日不獲解決，則荷蘭本國之經濟情况，一日無法好轉。目前除東印度與荷蘭本國之貿易。幾乎全部停頓外。據非官方估計：荷政府消耗於印尼之戰爭狀態者，日達三百五十萬盾。（荷幣），荷蘭人士甚美慕比利時擁有　大之非洲剛果，平靖無事。蓋比·荷兩姊妹國，經此次戰爭之冲洗以後，貧富懸殊，決非戰前所能想像。</p>
<p>但荷蘭殖民部之發言人，並不願深談荷政府因印尼問題遭受之窘態，海尼根手指滿懸四壁之地圖，稱荷政府要員印尼之行，純爲促使印尼問題，於明年（即今年）四月以前，求得完滿之解決，因明年四月，荷蘭將修改黨法，特別修改現行憲法中領土之一條，删除所謂直轄領土中，包括蘇門答臘，爪哇，婆羅洲，西里伯斯等字樣。一設若東印度羣島之政治形態一日不見穩定，則憲法之修改，仍有困難。」海牙非官方一部份人士之意見，認爲比爾首相此行歸來可能對印尼採取較爲强硬之政策。另一部荷　知識份子，以爲：祇須荷蘭印尼之間，訂定一較永久性之經濟互助條約，俾使印尼之豐富資源，有助於荷蘭之響濟窮困，則其他任何政治爭端，均不妨大大讓步。</p>
<p>至於海牙官方意見，則介乎此兩極端之問。本報記者曾與荷蘭外交部新聞處畏秘爾及其助手　希，談及各政黨對印尼紛擾之態度。多年曾爲『紐約時報』記者之穆爾處長，認爲荷政府之所謂印尼政策，過去悉由兩大政黨，即天主教黨之左派，與勞工黨之右派所會同決定，彼等因立塲中庸，故其所謂政策，亦易致因循被動，甚至表現猶豫不決。渠信比爾首相東行歸來，當有變革，渠吿記者：荷蘭勞工黨，即社會民主黨之化身，因欲符合英國艾德禮之工黨，改稱今名。該黨左派，主張對印尼讓步。擁有國會十席之荷蘭共產黨，主張自印尼無條件撤退，但天主敎黨（最大黨）之右派，則堅決主張維持傳統之殖民政策。</p>
<p>本報記者亦曾訪問荷閘經濟部之新聞處長魏茲哈斯博士，魏博士力言印尼糾紛必須早獲解決。但渠稱：目前荷蘭之　後經濟窮困，並非全由印尼問題而起，關於荷應當前經濟槪况，容另訊報導之。（十二月二十九日寄自海牙）</p>

<h3>預定陷阱密佈羅網不法商人如蛾撲火　　設餌捕鳥妙計奏效　金鈔黑市頓時歛跡</h3>
<p>所捕人犯週一移解地檢處究辦</p>
<p>滬金融管理及經濟檢查當局使用「設餌捕島」之妙計，於九日開始行動，對金鈔黑市痛下打擊，業已收獲預期之效果。此一妙計於三月前即已開始佈置，至最近始告完成。七日起金鈔黑市展開猛烈漲風，八日而達最高峯，當局乃決於九日起，將此一妙計，付之實施，以迅雷不及掩耳之法，作雷　之一擊。九日晚已礦獲本市六大金鈔黑市機構，逮捕主犯八人，十日繼續行動，擴大効果，金鈔黑市，已告歛跡。據預料當可維持相當時期。此一驚人措施，九日晨由金融管理局派員會同警局經濟警察共同執行，先已在某某兩處預定陷阱，密佈羅網，行動開始，彼從事金鈔投機者，有如飛蛾撲火，一一應聲落網，至九日晚其捕獲數十人，除交保者外，主犯八名，現押警局看守所，其名單為：沈正揚、劉積鑫，王嘉森、吳友仁、張永年、莊善炳、袁伯清、王子生。又根據旣得綫索，將本市六火金鈔黑市機構一一　獲，計為：　北陳京路四川路福泰烟號，　四川路寗波路順大烟號，　證券大樓二一六號，　寗波路二號大　號，　南京路二〇六號賓縣烟號，　金陵東路東自來火街沅上里四號。九日總共查獲之金鈔：　貢金十兩重之大條二百餘條，　美鈔二萬餘元，　東北流通券二萬〇四百元，　法幣十億〇二千二百五十一萬元，　支票二百四十餘億元。十日經濟警察對金鈔黑市繼續</p>

<h3>金融巨長李立俠談破獲黑市經過　　牽連一二百人繼續追捕中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金融管理局局長李立俠，昨日午後五時在國行接見記者，縱談礦獲金鈔案之經過。據談：此案牽連一二百人之多，已逮捕者亦有数十人，現正繼續追捕之中，故不能舉出確敷。昨日所逮捕者，皆為交易者之一造或金鈔　客，今日則追捕交易之另一造，或根據　答追捕當事人。逮捕實施之際，完全依據黃金，美鈔，支票，法幣四項綫索，除國行稽核處及金管局之平日調查紀錄外，尤注重當時之交易行為，昨日實施逮捕之處，均在交易地點，故使其無法否認。</p>
<p>二百億支票款項，已確定予以凍結</p>
<p>截至今日（十日）為止，已破獲之證物為黃金一百二十餘絛：美鈔一萬五千元以上；法幣約十億元；支票約二百五十億元，經金融局漏夜工作，巳確實凍結之支票款項達二百億元；支票戶頭除凍結沒收外，將另由法院依法罰處。昨日所破壞之最大交易地點，在本市北京路清遠里十號，搜出黃金九十條以上。目前已實施逮捕者，儘為從事此類交易者之小部份人，惟其餘之大部份，亦均有詳盡之調查記錄，將來如發現其有交易行為時，決加　捕。又在此巨案中，支票固均自行莊打出，惟不易確定有行莊本身從事此類黑市交易，只能說其有職員參與。外商之做金鈔交易者，決「一視同仁」，依法乘公辦理。</p>
<p>數百起可疑電話　暗中均加以記錄</p>
<p>李氏復指出：調查金鈔黑市之工作，自由國行稽核處開始負責後，為求達到目的，特建立許多獨立機構，與金鈔黑市交易地點混在一起，以便監視其電話電報，經數月之努力，數百起可疑之電話均有詳細之記錄，任何密碼暗語，均有專人譯出。姑舉　事為例：如此次破案中之永順利號）中正東路九六〇號），專做大規模之遷港僑匯黑市，設有秘密電台四起，每日平均收發密電三四十次，平日均經工作人員暗中加以記錄。此次破案後，搜出之密電，與稽核處平日之調查記錄，竟一無出入，可見辦事之效率。李氏並謂：本案中之金條現鈔支票，現大部已送國行保管，上海之金鈔黑市受此打擊，相信將有一二　期不復有黑市價格。以本市金鈔保藏量之多，以後小量交易自不能保證其絕無，但當盡力使金鈔價格不發生大波動而影響其他。此次破案之工作人員，均將傷予給獎，以酬其功。金案告一結束後，將呈報財部及中央銀行云。</p>

<p>純粹手工製造</p>
<p>地毯產區之和　，在新疆塔木戈壁之西南，為全新唯一手工業重鎮，該地特產除地毯外，尙有羊脂玉，皮箱，桑紙，俗有和　四寳之稱。製造地毯之原料，為新省土產羊毛，經過洗滌，配色，織製等手續，因係純粹手工製造，故一週內僅可織成尺許，丈長地毯，至少需時兩月。其圖案花紋，紅綠鮮明，充分融和印度，波斯，希臘，阿拉伯諸國之美術色彩。此外質地尤為堅韌，歐美人士道經新省者，均爭先選購，故和　地毯已成為新省歷年來外交禮品之一。</p>
<p>質地尙須加厚</p>
<p>昨到塲參觀選購之中外人士，俱認為該項地毯品質色彩均佳，惟尺寸不够，質地亦尙須加厚，西北公司已考慮將來採作改進參考。據該公司談：和　距上海遼遠，平時運輸，可由和　至迪化轉蘭州，再經西安轉隴海津浦而達京滬，自隴海路中斷後，祗有繞道重慶，故運輸里程約八千餘公里，由西陲至滬需三個見時間，惟該公司正設法使運輸暢通，今後邊疆　內地貨物之交流，當可更趨理想。</p>

<h3>哀九龍城</h3>
<p>「本報廣州八日航訊」提筆一寫九龍城的所謂「事件」，總不由人立即泛起五十年前國事悽惶的情景，說不出是悲是恨，八年苦戰，撒脫了一切帝國主義的枷鎖，　列五强，然而，新正初度，外交塲合折衛　俎的强韻歡笑中，和我們並肩戰勝敵人的一個友邦，居然又以進軍的姿態，拆毁了我們同胞在九龍自建及居住在一代以上的房十，捕去了站在我們國境裏的同胞，「友誼」兩字，變作自欺欺人的解釋，交涉云署，接近罷手的意義，說起來實不勝其悲凉之感！元月五日早晨五時正，港方動員了</p>
<p>全副武裝　的警察，帶起防寗面具，　牌，催淚彈，衛鋒車：如臨大敵，浩浩蕩蕩，直開九龍城，一聲令下，鐵錘舉利斧齊動，磚瓦與傢具亂飛，整整齊齊的一座中國領土的九龍城，十二小時內，夾爲平地，盡成廣墟，居民手無寸鐵，沉痛的心情已經使他們忘記了這還是祖國的領土，莊嚴的國旗被扯到地上，居民自己書寫「保衛領土主權」的標語一霎那與廢土而俱盡。</p>
<p>居民代表　朱沛唐劉毅夫，因為「抗拆」，也被港方越境拘押而去。在大舉拆屋時，有兩青年在旁邊偶發不平之語，立即為港警送上囚車，加上手銬，送回香港警署。房屋倒塌聲，婦孺哭號聲路上嘆息聲，紛嚷一片，簡直就是一座城市淪陷時候的情景！據悉：這次被拆房屋共七十四家，無家可歸之居民六百八十六人，損失財物時値不下國幣五十六億元，全城幾已歸於毀滅。</p>
<p>七日，兩廣外交特派員公署已奉到外部訓令提出</p>
<p>强硬抗議　宣稱：此事所引起一切後果，應由港方負其全責。郭氏亦表示：「現在僅爲事件之開端」，至於如何才是「煞尾」，倒要拭目以待我們政府的賢明決策了。事情已演變至此，房子已被人拆了，兩千多同胞正在流離失所，我們本身責任誰負，那是自己的事，然英方在事件還在交涉未有結果時，而突然越界拆屋拘人，這責任自然要英方完全負責的。我們希望外交當局要真正視此爲「事件的開端」。（本報記者梁小中）</p>

<h3>杭市年景</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州九日訊〕多災多難的卅六年悄悄地過去了，迎來的是卅七年的新姿劈頭就要碰到一個春節，（即舊曆年關）。使這尙在襁褓中的新年感到無比的苦楚。</p>
<p>當此隆冬的天氣，想到那在烽火中流離的災黎，住在杭州這天堂裏的人應該是　着幸福的。但是戰亂帶來了驚悸，敏感的混水摸魚者高抬了一切物價，使春節變得凄厲可怕，大多數貧苦的杭州人，都覺得這一「關」的難過。</p>
<p>漲風突起</p>
<p>在市塲上，棉紗，布疋，麵粉無一不漲，五福布中紡配價一百三十七萬五千元，市價隨升至一百四十三萬元，棉紗因爲花價突升，如靈寶花見七百萬元，計漲一百六十萬元，所以四二支藍鳳爲六千五百萬元，加了五百五十萬元。</p>
<p>在淸泰路的珠寶巷一帶，飾金的黑市也猖狂已極，據九日消息，售出每兩竟達一千一百十八萬元，收進也要一千一百十五萬元食米的漲風更是　人，掛牌一號米一百零五萬元，二號米也要一〇三萬，三號米九十六萬元無貨，暗中交易竟要一百五六十萬元一擔。</p>
<p>銀根鬆弛</p>
<p>這次物價的劇烈波動，其原因不外銀根太鬆弛，放款太多，游資趨於囤積之途。我們希望然家銀行一定要把銀根抽緊，雖國他會影響許多囤積居奇的人的破產倒坍，然而他可以把囤積的貨物拋出，以抑平這奔騰的物價，對大多數的人民一定可給予很多的幸福。</p>
<p>春節將近前的杭州市面，已不若去年此時的倒風旺盛了，家家店舖，好好的開着，生意雖然不見得好，然而藏着好的貨物，已一旦三價了。而且因爲銀根的平弛，所以還有餘款來購置貨物。</p>
<p>農界痛苦</p>
<p>但是工，礦，農這三界，却顯得不甚景氣，工礦業因為成本日益高漲，不如囤購原料，來得容易賺錢，尤其年賞問題，傷盡了主持工礦業的腦筋。農界同胞，在秋收以後，都有一般盛景，因爲那時糧價提得很高，那裏知道這米價却似平步靑雲，飛黄騰達，一直沒有平過，到春節將近，竟已接近二百萬的數字了。農胞們的米，早已脫手了，現在反要拿錢來向販賣者買了。至於農田裏面生產出來的蔬菜，一般聰明的投機者，知道不和囤積的，而又因爲天時凉爽的關係，買菜回家多了吃不完明天還好吃。所以在瘋狂的物價漲潮聲中，農產品的小菜反見得平穩。然而農胞們却想售去了小菜，買一些日用品回家好過春節的，結果是大失所望，所以在比較不景氣的工，礦，農三界之中，農界是最爲痛苦的。</p>
<p>公務人員</p>
<p>然而比農菜界更痛苦的還有着呢，那就是靠薪水生活的公敎員，一個月拿到七八十萬元，他家裏有老有小，要他扶養，試問今天的七八十萬元，怎樣維持他們一家大小？</p>
<p>去年的天堂年景，是商業不景氣，「倒風」狂襲。今年的天堂年景，商業的情形比去年好，而晨·工·礦·公敎人員都相對飲泣，不知何以渡過這春節的年關？</p>
<p>市容進步</p>
<p>不過，天堂雖然是如此的艱難，但在市容上似乎比去年好得多了。去年，在湖濱的店家廊管下，蜷縮着的一堆堆的苦難的人民處處皆是，而今年在冬初時曾經看見過，後來就不見了。去年英士街，延齡路，湖濱路，暗角落裏，一些苦命的女孩子，僵立在冷風裏拉客，今年這些苦命的女孩子不見了。去年城隍山上的相士，與西子湖裏的船伏，和尙廟裏的和尙，記者有時與他們晤見時，他們都有時日難度的感覺，今年記者和他們晤見時，他們却沒有這個感覺了。因爲今年的杭州香汛爲近四十年來所沒有過的，這些人都被香客們的賜予而解決了困難了。</p>
<p>那麽去年天堂裏的苦難的乞丐與苦命的女子到那裏去了呢？是不是他們已經有了生活的着落了呢？還是政府爲了整飭市容，把他們驅使到僻街深巷去了呢？我倒不無懐疑。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>逸園足球出冷門　東華新陣失風竟為體德所挫　二比一敗於下半時十二碼球</h3>
<p>東華旣得馬華兩虎將陳家萬夏體先來歸，實力頓時大增，爲試驗新陳容，昨日下午特約體德作友誼賽於逸闌，球迷一時轟動，統計六千餘人，相當熱鬧，惜乎東華全隊，昨日表演，未臻理想，馬來新將，確有獨到之處，賈幼良則似乎减色，體德攻守俱佳，東華竟以一比二受挫，大為抱憾，上半時各一和局。勞勃司托夫受制於鐔福禎，未能有所發展，徐福生之守門，則大受衆賞，比賽情形，略述如次：</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>張邦論</p>
<p>陳家萬　莊友仁</p>
<p>韓龍渡　鐔福禎　於治興</p>
<p>李垚　孫錦順　韓龍海　夏體先　賈幼良</p>

<p>唐佐文　長榮上　陳效平</p>
<p>高洛夫　愛德華　勞勃司托夫　東　　上　劉隆與下　　世泰下　曹琴芳</p>
<p>裁判李　義，體德開球，小黃毛來犯，鐔福禎截住去路，東華回擊，夏體先費幼良聯騎並進，龍海初試頭頂，徐福生正中懐抱，體德　機再起，亦　效果，一來一往，頗見緊張。混戰至卅五分鐘時，莫華總攻，夏體先中路派司，孫錦順搭球疾進，許而茲阻擋不及，鐵腿起處，徐　生挽救乏　，一比　東華首開紀錄。體德心有不甘，大舉來襲，曹琴芳近門試探，張邦綸拍出未遠，勞勃司托夫及時趕到，力射入網，一比一上半時成和局。</p>
<p>易陣再戰，東華原陣不變，體德陳壓築退伍，劉陸聲走馬上任，東華五鋒猛，徐福生一再救險，東華望門興嘆。未幾，許而茲手吻皮球，孫錦順主罰，徐福生又見救駕立功。十六分鐘時，東華鐔福禎禁區犯規，十二碼球，劉隆　聲操刀，脚起門開，體德二比一超出。東華全隊反攻，機會雖多，奈徐福生出手敏捷，一一救出。至終場前四分鐘，禮　德錢長榮脚傷離塲，　世泰入捕，任右內鋒，劉隆　後退，補長榮遺缺，轉缺間銀笛大鳴，時間終了，東華新陣初試，竟以一比二受挫於體德。</p>

<p>晨初以史太林逝世之傳說，搖惑人心，致已疲之局面，益見虛怯，開　即低，中法且續迫跌停，永紗以七四〇元及七四一元登塲，開後迫降至七一八元及七二七元低價。一三七號供售尤多，檯面幫因鑒於前日塲外有大戶猛出，對此時一三七號之力舊，希圖掀小即交，咸認爲大戶意　圖在塲外抵補，是以人心反好。不久，塲外報價果見矜高，場內亦有人補進，乃升至七三八元及七五六元。息價開高至二角四及二角八分半後，退爲七二〇元及七三〇元。二〇七號六五號七三號一五五號三〇號二三號奮購遞交，一五二號等進即交，一一七號九八號五四號雖賣，仍被拎高到七五〇元及七六五元高價。各小股亦吿倘利。浮多臨收有了結，午收復用居於七二四元及七四三元。結果較前收計即交股中法跌停後有回，尙跌一成，內衣火柴華新永業跌半成，新光景福五和小升，閘北大通中絲平平，餘者咸吿　降。遞交股美亞跌半成，動興尙平，新光景福華體微升，永紗信和微降。塲外各老股，頗見穩定。</p>
<h3>統債互有升降外股由疲轉穩</h3>
<p>公債昨參差不一，丙跌而雜升，差價遂稍　攏。中途之偵勢，亦難持久。統丙晨開五二〇〇〇元，高至五七〇〇〇元，低至五〇五〇〇元而後稍定。成交約六百萬。較前收計甲乙升七百元，丙跌七百元，丁戊漲一千元。</p>
<p>外股昨由疲轉穩，港申電縮至二元七，中途尙易重振。怡紗自五六萬起，　漲至六二萬五結束。證券帮先進後出，廣帮稍納，洋商則出。結果較前收計紙版升半成，業廣跌一成，墾植話電車尙平，餘股升降俱見。</p>

<h3>絲綢均見疲落</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市續告挫降，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開　週一期做開一千萬元，旋因供求失衡，且各物行情，均報向小，以致喊價頻頻降跌。即期價最小九千九百五十萬元，午收一億元。週一期〇二百萬元，下午稍見回好，一度到過七八百萬元，卒又降至五百萬元。結果比上日跌落七百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市甚為沉靜，各方均抱觀望，故場內只聞喊價而無成交。昨上午只做開D字等級一槍，價一億〇四百萬元，不過有八天期頭。下午因週六，亳無交易，各級廠絲及千經喊價，均與上日相仿。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>

<h3>台糖漲風稍戢</h3>
<p>昨糖市因近日投機份子間有實力不支者，已吿倒閉，同業中頗有戒心，台糖漲風稍戢。公會劃盤，現貨上落較微，期貨棧單小至六七萬元。現貨四半白袋裝一百八十六萬元，小五萬元，二四粗白一百八十九萬元，小萬元，二〇中砂白貨缺，原價不動。土糖仍堅，汕提靑開一百七十萬元原盤，刁靑軋缺，升七萬元，爲一百六十七萬元，興化白袋裝一百八十六萬五千元至九十萬元，升六萬元，　裝一百八十萬元至八十四萬元，升二萬至至六萬元。與赤一百六十入萬元至七十萬元，升四五萬元，餘乏对　。</p>
<h3>紗布售價繼續下降</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開即低。客帮去化轉　，本街進意亦淡，塲內利　消息傳播，浮多獲利出籠，四十二支盡鳳紗曾低至六千零五十萬元。迨近收市，本街複製廠商見小稍進，回上至六千一百五十萬元，比上日再跌二百九十萬。此外各支粗細紗亦均步降，目八九十至至一·二·三百萬不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况，因金鈔黑市下　，銀根趨緊，更以當局澈查　戶，　力嚴重，人心見虛。同類斬售不已，浮多爭脫，又値紡建供售之期，籌碼充沛，行情遂告步疲。結果十二磅　頭等各檔綢布，續跌五·六·七萬元。全日　勢，以士林布及色布廠總步高，做價獨兌俏俐。其餘漂布斜文嗶嘰　貿錄布，市面俱呈疲憊之局。又訊：紡建公司供售喇叭童細布，掛價一百三十一萬元，金蓮妙舞元嗶一百四十八萬，四君子直貢一百五十八萬元。共售布二七一二〇疋，申請單七一一張。內廠商一八張，購布七八〇疋，布號六九三張，解布二六三四〇疋。</p>
<h3>現棉市況轉活</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况因　廠吸胃展開，同業互有做開，紡總公司收購登記花衣，亦同時開始，開價亦較一般預料為高，故人心　堅，成交一一五〇包。送廠價做開靈賓六〇三萬五千，六四四萬八千漢口細絨五二九萬一千，紡建收購登紀花衣計漠細五九〇萬，德字棉六五〇萬。同業做開棧交價漢細四九六萬，五〇〇萬至五五一二萬，冲沙市四九六萬，山東木架五九五萬二千，周浦籽花一二三萬。</p>
<h3>客貨爭相吐售人心趨　各檔米價均回跌</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕米市因當局綢　在市場大量供應，人心趨軟，市勞不振。客貨爭相吐售，各擋米價均吿回跌。市塲登記到貨共二萬三千九百四十四石。市場管理委員會在南北市場各供應九千石，合共一萬八千石，較上日增加三千石，仍以一百三十五萬元之價配出。社會局長吳開先昨稱，當局此項在市場供應食米之政策，將繼續至米價穩定時為止。吳局長肯定表示米價將吿回跌，下週定交低於一百三十五萬。</p>
<p>據吳局長分析此次米價上漲原因，認為一月來本市米糧到貨平均每日皆在一萬五千石以上，此足聲明來源並非枯竭。如一定指係商人作祟，則產區價格高漲亦為實情，故主因猶在大鈔之發行。滬糧商採購之大枇稱米前在南京被扣，經査明放行，已路　運滬。本市民食前述：不致形成有無問題。現當局每日在市塲以一百三十五萬之價大批供應，加利潤及還輸等費用後，零售價以不超過一百五十萬為合理，否則即為暴利，社會避將予取締。吳局長並稱：社會局前令各零　米號必　以實　標明價格，至今日久玩生，各米號多已不行。値此米價波動期間，爲免不法商人從中拍價，已令飭米號萊同業公會轉飭各米號，一律恢復　價辦法，必需於米　上標明米　及每石價格，否則不論其超過限價與否，槪予懲罰。</p>
<h3>雜糧漲跌互見油猛烈回瀉</h3>

<p>麵粉供多求少，止漲　跌，回挫萬元。　皮鄕銷亦呆，失傳落七八千元。豆餅納戶稀少，求脫者衆，猛削二萬元。黃豆客帮與化將動，本街聞散，油廠以製成品下降，進意　　。早定午疲，收聲帶軟。　豇豆南北洋交易均淡，形成漲呆之局。豇豆北洋採納，節節高翔，　升三四萬元。　豆另化香燥步砌三四萬元，赤豆華南猛烈　購之下，　　飛奔四五萬元。</p>
<p>紅糧交淡少紳，回疲萬元。苞米北方　　，初　後餅。生仁廣　轉　，暴落十餘萬元。芝蔴消化淸淡，回跌三五萬元。巽蔴亦然乏神。</p>
<p>油市供過於求，攻入疲境，廠方大量供應，豆油猛瀉十餘萬元，生油菜油蔴油均相　挫落五六萬元、臨收仍少受主。小麥節挺一二萬元。</p>

<h3>洛惠渠完成</h3>
<p>— 行政院新聞局攝</p>
<p>陝西省中部，古稱關中，尙書「厥土惟黃壞，厥田惟上上」極利農業，惟地勞高亢，雨澤稀少，常　亭患，每遇災荒，人民流離失所，與飢餓而死者，不可勝計，振興水利，寫為救荒根本之圖。洛惠渠為中國水利先進故　儀社先所訂閱中八惠水利計劃之一。引洛水以灌大荔，朝邑兩縣，鐮山以南之平原，面積計一三三五方里，可灌田地五十萬畝，工程規模為八惠之冠。民國二十二年陝省府設引洛工程處，開始勘測，廿三年設計完成，以工程費鉅，非地方財力所能負担，商准中央設涇洛工程局，於五月成立，按照計劃積極進行，至廿六年六月，納幹憑計五二一公里，各幹渠共長八〇公里，主要建築物如大壩，渠閘，渡槽，涵洞，橋樑，及第一，二，三，四號隧洞，均先後完成。</p>
<p>第五號隧洞，穿越鐵鐮山，遭遇湧泉及流沙，進行異常艱難，在廿七年至三十四年載之閒，曾試用各種方法，但以時值抗戰，物力財力，均感不足，收効甚微，至卅年九月，行政院水利委員會成立，選請中外專家到工程區會同研討改進辦法。翌年九月，經蔣主席令，限期完工，由水利委員會　派高級技術人員，駐工督導，經過種種艱辛，卒以人力克服困難，於卅五年十一月二十六日全洞穿通，連同北段舊洞共長三千三百七十七公尺，十二月十二日正式防水，渠長共三十餘公里，勘測開鑿費時十五年，工程費總數至本年九月底止，按陝西省每年物價指數折合戰前法幣，共用三百另一萬五千〇九十三元。</p>
<p>按照核定灌溉計劃，由水利局督促民衆開挖斗渠完成後，每年可增產小麥十萬市担，豆榖雜糧七萬五千市石，棉花七百五十萬市石斤，田地本身全部可增值二千二百五十億元。</p>
<p>總渠　之涵泂有五，以宣洩渠左之坡水，此為其中之一。</p>
<p>自分水閘而下相度地勢為中東西幹渠三道。渠度坡底由一千五百分之一至二千五百分之一不等，視地勢傾斜之緩急而定其目的務使水無廢棄，田能普溉，保持相當流速，以免沖刷或淤塞之弊，圖為放水後渠水湧流而下。</p>
<p>洛惠渠總幹渠自陝西澄城縣老　村洛河之石陝瀑跌，築滾水壩以引渠，壩高一六·二〇公尺壩頂長度一七七·〇〇公尺，壩面為渥奇式，壩軸係弧形，全壩體積二〇·五二五立方公尺自廿三年三月開工，廿四年一月全壩成功。</p>
<p>分水閘在義井村東總幹渠　處，由比分為中，東，西，三幹渠各閘皆一孔，寬二·六公尺，高二·三公尺，由絞齒機啟閉之，</p>
<p>總幹渠之大渡槽有二，其一在屈里河，長一一六公尺槽寬三·三一公尺，斷　六·七二平方公尺坡度千分之一，槽水深二公尺。</p>
<p>渠閘及排洪閘，兩閘距離進水口二五〇公尺為全渠控制機關，渠閘設兩孔，排洪閘在渠閘之右，成九十度直角，設三孔，洪水時期入渠泥水由此宣洩入河，閘門啟閉均由絞齒機控制。</p>
<p>總幹渠洞有五，以第五號洞工程最艱鉅，長三三七七公尺寬三公尺，傾斜為千分之一，二十二年十月工程師張平之赴上游測量時，在五號洞高崖下墜殉職，故命名「平之洞」以誌之。</p>

<h3>談西洋鏡</h3>
<p>— 介丁</p>
<p>在我小的時候，西洋鏡還有他的世界，街頭巷尾只要有一架「西洋鏡」到了，人們馬上爭先恐後地去佔住「看」的洞眼（我不知道應該叫做什麽名字）。管的人就个張張換動畫片，嘴裏唱着每个張畫片的形容詞。看的人謎了一只眼，用一只眼睛望西洋景的箱子裏看，經過鏡片和鏡箱的作用，平常不以爲奇的畫片。放大了，生出幻光來了，像煞是活動了許多。在「賣」西洋鏡的「粉腿如林」，「轟炸奇景」，「肉搏戰」：的喊聲下，看來更是津津有味，西洋鏡便成了鄉下沒有見過電影的人的恩物。</p>
<p>看西洋鏡還有一個好處，看的人都是俯了頭，一隻眼對準了洞眼看，臉都藏在鏡箱面前，身子從此僂　，別人瞧不見看客臉上的表情，更不見鏡箱裏的畫片。因此，隨便看客開心也好，慚愧也好，冷笑也好，大驚小怪也好，嘻笑怒　悉聽尋便，人家只以爲你看到了够「感動」的事物，決下會恥笑你的無知，或少見多怪，也猜測不到你看到的究竟是干涉。即使人家謾開幾聲，也只怪他們自己沒有見到鏡箱裏面的天地，反是見識淺陋了。</p>
<p>可是只要把西洋鏡一拆穿，什麼奇妙景像都消失了，只　下幾張普通常見的紅紅綠綠粗俗畫片，不僅使看客失望，還要被人駡做一錢不値，這却就成爲大煞風景的事情了。</p>
<p>原來西洋鏡只靠了狹小的鏡、箱和小洞的鏡頭而已，先把畫片關進暗黑的小箱子，再經過「觀點」洞眼看，才是活生生的「景物」，因此，賣西洋鏡的人只能高聲吆喝：「不經過我的鏡頭看就沒有　術了。」一方面再在控制鏡頭上打注意，凹透鏡，凸透鏡，折光玻璃，三稜鏡，旁邊加面凹凸反射鏡，再在鏡片上塗紅黃藍白的顏色，經過折光，光，分光，全反射：等作用，到的景像就居然不差了。而被的畫片，倒是拾來就是，只要得過鏡頭，也就無所謂。</p>
<p>看起來電影是比較「公開」點的，但也是經過幾回「鏡頭的過濾，又是化裝，又是編導又是剪緝，所　的眞實也實在有限，而西洋鏡就被淘汰下去了。</p>
<p>不過我倒是喜歡簡單的自然景物或者粗俗的歌舞戲劇的，因爲五花八門的西洋鏡之類，至多不過使人眼花撩亂吧了。</p>

<h3>談袖子</h3>
<p>— 任微音</p>
<p>天氣寒冷；袖子便見殊功，長袍暖袖，兩手一籠，倒也有十分風趣。</p>
<p>提起袖子，說來話長，從兒童時期起，就用以揩鼻涕，擦眼淚，中國如此，西方亦然。據說，西裝袖子口的鈕扣，原是釘在面上，以免用袖子揩鼻涕，後來劣習改了，鈕扣才移到袖口下部，成了裝飾品，原來區區之物，也有其進化史。而袖子之功用，豈僅此也：旅行到四川，看到一個鄕鎭上，村人見面都　手　　，深為　　，為什麼歐洲風味，潔入一至於此！後來方知是商業規矩，例不開口、以手指爲數字，在「袖子事　價錢」，不禁恍然大悟，暗歡袖子之功，至此益偉。至於古人」　汗如雨，張袂成陰」的話兒，想來也未爲吹牛，道家的袖裏乾坤，雖說玄之又玄，但是乒乓球大的原子彈能毁滅廣島，大袖一揮，鬧天宮的孫猴子又焉能不入獲中！</p>
<p>香　人物，喜說說「紅袖添香」，但是「天寒翠袖薄」，即不免寒抖陣陣，失掉那股新鮮味兒。袖子還有表情，唱戲時袖子一抖，可博來速環大彩，朋友失了和氣要「拂袖而去」。袖子裹藏的兵器呌做「袖刃」，一言不合，我們的英雄遠會「嗖！」的一聲，放出「袖箭」，見血封喉，包管一時三刻去見閻王。</p>
<p>袖子之用，旣妙且博，怪道風　人物都要一「長袖善舞」，請求袖子功夫，袖子裏旣能講價錢，　機關，翻動斗，提猴兒，天下滔滔，此中何事不可為！無怪薰風陣陣，舞袖翩翩，銅臭被野，餓殍載道，甚而家國扳蕩，社稷危傾了。</p>
<p>至若三家村冬烘，寒酸秀才，不免寒流一枕，淸風兩袖，都因爲有袖而不善舞，蘇東坡「袖手莫輕價將種」不過解嘲云云，元好間「世事今歸袖手看」乃是阿〇精神。天生一物必有其用，醫諸袖子，善用者飛黃騰達，居然暴富，不善用者徒爾揩揩鼻涕，擦擦眼淚而已。與慨之餘，三呼阿門，天下之不不深明袖子哲學者，能不及時猛省乎！</p>
<h3>資格</h3>
<p>— 惕齋</p>
<p>中華敎育界十二月號有董渭川君一文，談到文憑之無用。用對話體寫了兩個沒有拿到大學文憑而當了大學院長的故事，這使我感慨很多。記得大學畢業之後，根本不想領那張紙頭，失業當不了飯票，作事常不了保證，找事更不足爲媒妁，要他幹甚麼？可是學校那時候把文憑囤積起夾，一方面固頭疼於保管之不易，一方面又不便輕輕發出去，因爲欠了四年的講義費之類，全仗此一紙作爲抵押，好比肉票一般，明知沒多少錢，也不能壞了規矩。</p>
<p>我終於不能不去取這張「得稱文學士」的光榮紙頭了，因爲要敎「公民」，公民是不可擅敎的，得經過檢定，省級，中央級，好像叙資格似的一層一層呈上去，非有文憑不可，迫不得已，只好花去大洋二十六元（補費）把他從註册課的箱子底上領出來，時已隔畢業三年又六個月矣。當我領取之時，註册主任孔老先生以破鑼一般的嗓音訓道：「怎麼早不領，到這時來找麻煩！一我則伸伸舌頭：「對不起，若是不急用，還要請你替我保管幾年呢。」也虧了這一領，七七事變一發生，光是這種待領的證件就是幾大箱，也隨着圖　儀器歷盡千山萬水逃到內地，說不定有了若干張的損失。</p>
<p>證書就用過這一次，—可是我以爲用到愈少愈好，至少表示你的職業穩定，不必像從前租界戒嚴似的，來回抄把子，看市民證。可是近來好像有點改變了，當中學敎員要檢定，小學更要檢定，這就非得隨時獻出法實不可。有一天，也許得像派司一般，隨身携帶，以備檢問，那麽，我希望把證書改印成電車的月季票那麼大，省得口袋裝不下。</p>
<p>我有許多同學，共綽號均稱「半年」，如「張半年」「陴半年」之類，何以故？蓋其敎書也，半年必作結論，非被學生趕走，即被當局辭退，故以此呼之。此　飯桶，什九於其名片上冠以「××大學×學士」，若是國立，就更得堂哉皇之的掛上這塊金子招牌。細想起來，莫非文學士等等專爲此輩而設嗎？文憑也專爲此輩而發嗎？譬如說，他也是學師範的，而且有累積十餘「半年」之經騐，如今拿了一打　聘醫及文憑來檢定，那一定無異議通過了，—而且在經騐上是一等敎員，多宏豐呀，艱道他便是刮刮呌的好敎帥？從此不會「半年」？天　得！</p>
<p>這也眞是難題，管行政的人可以說：「依你，莫非阿貓阿狗都可以作公敎人員？不必檢定，也不必銓叙？」我可不敢這麼脫。我只是覺得有證件的也未嘗不是阿貓阿狗，而沒設件的阿貓阿狗也許正是才智之士。王荆公的贖盂嘗君傳說得好：「鷄鳴狗盜之出其門，此士之所以不至也！」中國的奇才異能之士，有時倒是寗可埋沒，而不肯牛驥同一槽的，當然，這是太各人主義了，不足爲訓，可是事實上因此而喪失若十人才，那是沒法子想的。</p>
<p>從歷史上看，這重資格的辦法，也是出於不得已，古代本來是選舉的，有孝廉方正，有經明行修，…漢代郡國，是每二十萬人舉一人。無論民主不民主，總比較注重與論，是合理的道路。黃巾之亂以後，人口遷移，選政中輟，戰爭是一切罪惡的源頭，從此察舉的辦法等於廢止，曹操時陳羣建議九品中正之法，雖然「上品無寒門，下品無士族，」但也還不能完全拋了公義。汝南的許劭就是專門主持公道的一個。等到「停年格」的方式一來，才正式走向資格之路，那是論服務年限以為銓選的標準的才幹，智能，皆非所計，過去很爲許多人所詬病。科舉與起以後，停年格雖不行，可是已竟寓於科舉之中，因為已服務的人，升轉全要看資歴。</p>
<p>實際上這又不是今日之比。科舉的方法雖有毛病，然而對一般人機會均等，是他的最大特長。如今呢，科員，書記要招考，要資歷，中學敎員要資歷，小學敎員要資歷：但部次長大學校長，却有幾個是從書記科員熬出來的！只許州官放火，又有甚麼意思？</p>

<h3>憶熊鳳凰</h3>
<p>— 凌霄漢閣</p>
<p>鳳凰態希齡秉三氏，於民國二二十六年尾，逝於香港，迄今已十週年，葡京名流胡適之博士爲寫紀念文，熊夫人毛女士有長篇述避寇氛積勞病沒之經過。按熊係湖南鳳凰廳人，壬辰貢士，甲午補殿試成進士，得翰林庶常，戊戍在籍參預維新，與陳三立伯嚴回廢　。後數年以趙爾巽及戰澤之援引，起爲東三省監理官，授鹽運使。民國二年為國務總理，三年退職，專辦社會事業，於平西香山創慈幼院，敎育貧寒兒童，是大功德。二十五年與毛彥文結婚於上海之幕爾堂，態年六十六，毛年三十三，合成九十九，白髮朱顏，時稱佳話。熊前室朱氏已故，毛與有世交係晚戰，觀務署長朱庭祺與三家皆有姻戚關係，因以玉成。北平報界委予撰一喜聯須將以上各點包羅在內，乃點綴成文曰：「以近古希之齡，奏鳳求風之曲，九九丹成，恰好三三行滿，登朱庭祺之庭，覩毛彥文之彥，雙　如願，誰云六六無能。」上海報上所載馮某夫人之「舊同學成新伯母。」「老年伯做大姐夫，」表明輩份，令人解頤。</p>
<p>「九一八」變後，綢以「一二八，」政府召集「國難會議」，熊氏被邀。時汪精衛在洛陽紀念週漬稅，忽云「一九一五年對日本之二十一條，係袁世凱所簽定，爲當今國難會議會員熊秉三所　署。此人尙在上海，如果到進此間，我們就殺掉他！」熊見報導，怒而且笑，即兩致汪氏曰：「一千九百十五年為民國四年，弟於民國三年三月即已交卸國務總理，相距一年有餘，此副署何人。公司查明政府公報，便知其誤。一此事真是笑話，非尋常「張冠李戴」可比。按民四中日交沙，與日使日置益共簽條約者乃外交總長陸微祥，副署宣布訂約之命令者乃國務卿徐世昌，與熊毫不相干。汪氏出言輕率，如此荒唐，且態度激昂，似乎愛國仇日，熱血沸騰，達於極點，豈料淪陷期中，竟爲僞府首領，媚日罪魁，而所欲殺之能氏，却保全淸白，至死不曾改節。人情叵測，眞一言難盡了。</p>
<h3>閒話香烟</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>望着手枝間夾着的一支Ruby　Queen，感到生活的重担是越來越沉重了。從「　運道」，「馬力斯」，「大前門」而一直降級到今日的「大英牌」，我真不能不嘆息生活的悲哀。再過幾天，也許祗能「享受」「哈德門」或「老刀牌」了。</p>
<p>說抽香烟是一種生活的「享受」，也許不能博得一部份人的同情，因為鴉片烟都可戒得，何況區區幾支香烟。然而對於知道香烟是怎樣一種妙不可言東西的人，必也知道戒雅片更難—難在香烟並無眞正的「癮」，難在其具有一種令人難以忘情的樂趣對於尙未有抽香烟習慣的人，我決不動他去嘗試，因為這是個人的嗜好，是不能勉強的。反之，對於已經領　略上樂趣的人，我也決不勸他戒烟，因為不僅我自己是一個屢經嘗試的失敗者，而且也不知看見過多少同好回到原來的「崗位」去了、現在自已早已抑著海枯石爛此志不移的決意，誓願成為「香烟薫」的終身同志。</p>
<p>旣抽烟後而中途忽起戒意，一般都不外發自三種動機。第一是經濟，第二是疾病，第三是精神上的自省。現在且不說一二兩種原因。所謂精神上的自省，往往起自初抽烟來久的人。有許多平日潔身自好的靑年，平時討厭烟酒，後來在偶然的機會中不自覺的養成了抽烟的習慣，有時便不免覺得內疚，以為是失去了一個好靑年的身份，甚至暗暗惴然於烟　也許會是他　落生活的開端。</p>
<p>不過這是多餘憂慮。因爲抽香烟與吸雅片究竟不同，雅片的麻醉力可使一個人的生活沉湎於斯而從此浸沒在黑海中，不復企望其他。香烟中所含的尼古丁雖然亦有若干麻醉作用，例如最初發見烟草的麥耶族人，即視烟草中的麻醉作用是一種神性，歐洲第一個吸香烟的西班牙人洛峙利喀·第·海萊斯，且因此而受宗敎法庭的審判，可是香烟的麻醉作用，僅止乎輕微的刺激而已，它所給人的效果，是一種淡然的興奮。如果你認爲連這種淡然的興奮也應加以拒絕，那我敢說未免把人生意義看得太嚴肅了。</p>
<p>喜歡喝酒或品茗的人，一杯在手便覺怡然自得。但喝酒和喫茶　以閒時爲宜，因爲執杯在手，有許多塲所是不大相宜的，且也不宜帶着到處跑。香烟便不然。這根粗細有致長短適宜的小東西，你拿在手裏便覺得有些不平凡。當你擦的一聲劃着一根火柴，而在嘴裏噴出第一縷靑烟來時，你立即領略到一種難以形容的舒服。如果你是空閒着，則一手執杯（不管是茶或酒），一手執烟，兩眼望着天上白雲悠悠，那時你祗覺得心曠神怡，其刹那間的樂趣也衹有你個人能領會得。</p>
<p>這並不是過份的形容，因為雖然不是每一支烟都能招來這樣的境界，但對於知道怎樣抽烟的人，這樣的境界確是存在的。我不反對爲經濟或健康的原因戒抽香烟，但因淸敎徒式的觀念而想戒烟，這就大可不必。在此生活艱苦的時代，一些輕淡的刺激與興奮，應說是人生的一種必耍，因爲你由此所得的並不是麻醉，而倒是淸醒與振奮。</p>
<p>不過抽香烟的嗜好也像一切屬於嗜好類的東西一樣，即不能趨之過份。曾見許多人嗜烟嗜到終日手不釋「捲」（捲烟），以至咳嗆連迎，妨害了身體的健康，這就似乎不瞭解香烟的作用了。照我看，每天十枝左右的限度，並在你覺得最適合的時問加以享用，這才使你能眞正領略到抽烟的樂趣。</p>
<h3>貓捕魚</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>貓是一種狡猾的動物，單說牠們所使用的捕魚的方法，就有不少的故事。</p>
<p>有人看到一隻貓探頭在小池旁，還以爲牠在喝水，可是，趨近一看，才知剛才觀察的錯誤。原來他正利用他的舌頭作餌，引誘魚兒浮上水面來。待魚兒眞的被誘浮上來的時候，牠便迅速的張開大口，咬住那些愚蠢的魚。</p>
<p>貓也會把這個方法顛倒過來，牠把牠的尾巴放在水面以下，當一條魚游上來觀看毛茸茸的究竟是甚麽東西的時候，貓便敏捷的掉轉身來，用牠的利爪把魚活生生的鈎上來，共出「手」之快，使漁夫自嘆不如。</p>
<p>可是，最機敏的貓的捕魚術還要算在一個金魚池旁被人所發現者。在這個例子之中，是兩隻貓合作的完成牠們的偸食的勾當。因爲金魚不時的失蹤，魚主便生了猜疑之心，於是，一天晚上，他便悄悄的藏身在池邊守獲着。不久，偸魚賊來了，不過，他們不是人，而是兩隻貓。牠們走近魚池，低下頭去，幾乎觸及水面，牠們的瞳孔放大了的眼睛在月光之下閃爍着。牠們一動也不動的等候了一陣子，隨後，突然的一撲爪，便有一條躍動的金魚被帶出來了。對於這件事的唯一的解釋是：貓用牠們的閃耀的眼睛迷惑和引誘可憐的魚兒浮上水一面來，然後加以捕獲。</p>
<p>貓的偸食雖然令人惱怒，但是在　食的行爲中却也顯示出一種　　。</p>

<p>第六章　禍不單行（三八）</p>
<p>綺執受了這一番曲，認爲莫大恥辱，走進後台，竟放聲大哭起來，連說受不了，不喝了，梅願退回包銀，園主人再三賠　央求，綺紈口口聲聲，祗說不能再受遺委曲，一定要回去。後來由她哥哥鶴舟，再三勸解，說：「今晚的事，原是翻衆取鬧，可也怪不得他們，傳單上原是這樣印着，你若是負氣，和園方解約回去，原無不可，在濟南鬧出這笑聒，回去怎麼見人，父親也不答應呀！現在要恢復名譽，最爲要緊，我看這地人，對　派的　，懂得　情內行人很少，普通都是慕名而來，他們目的不在戲，注意在新噱頭，像上次吳紅舫在這地露演紡棉花，竟是天天滿座，吳紅舫所大幷胡房子，就是紡花紡出來的，可見這地人看　的程度，現在我們到這緊要關頭，不能再拘小節，要通權達變，應付應付才好。你肯貼出紡棉花，我墾當然可賣滿座，不但名譽恢復，就是我們包銀，也要增加，專後再告訴父親，老人家必能原諒，成敗在此一舉，你要拿出勇氣幹一幹，不要再退縮了。」綺紈經鶴舟一番勸解，細細一想，覺得也祗有這一條路可走，和園方商好，貼出紡棉花，第一天上台，綺紈祇　加噱頭，學　乃父疙疸腔，唱了一段定軍山，竟博得滿場好。第二天演紡棉花，觀衆更來的踴躍，園中已無隙地，加凳，買飛票，竟弄得如火如茶，如此一運七天，天天演紡棉花，天天滿座，當地人對於這齣戲，竟有百看不厭的趨勢。綺紈見名譽業已恢復，合同將滿，要　勢收篷，園方祗是不肯，再三懇求，續訂合同，增加包銀，再展兩星期，綺紈迫於衆情，祇好答應。給紈本是很聰明的，看定觀衆心理，每一紡棉花上塲，總換一個新噱頭，弄得當地人看了還想看，大家見面便談紡棉花，預測今晚又是如何新噱頭，給這齣紡棉花，弄得如醉如痴。綺紈到此，竟是名利變收，正在大紅大紫的時候，突然北平來了急電：「北洋戲院　顧鶴舟，父病危速　，鶴山。鶴舟接到這封電報時，已是夜裏十一點鍍，綺紈正在台上演紡棉花，還　完塲，鶴舟心裏雖然焦急，却不敢驚動她，一直等她完塲，卸裝回到飯店，鶴舟才拿出電報給她那。綺紈一看電報內「病危」二字，便放聲大哭，說道：「我們快回去，不唱了！」鶴舟道：「那能如此簡單，你和園方合同關係，是不能走的，我明早先趕回去，如必需你回去，你再回去。」綺紈哭道：「萬一有個意外，我如何對得住父親？」鶴舟范：「你就回去也沒用處，並且鶴山向來膽小，遇事最愛張　，也許父親的病情，不至如此嚴重，我先回去看看再說。」</p>

<h3>The Brilliant War Results of the National Army in Western Liaoning: Five Brigades of Bandit Troops Collapsed, with Over 40,000 Casualties; Chairman Departs from Nanjing, Flies to Beiping, and Transfers to Shenyang for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Chairman Chiang departed from Nanjing by special plane at 12:30 PM on the 10th to fly to Beiping and then transfer for inspection. Yu Jishi and others accompanied him. It is heard that Chairman Chiang will return to Nanjing on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, accompanied by his staff Hang Renjie, Liu Yong, and others, flew to Qing on a special plane at 8:00 AM on the 10th to meet with Chen Cheng to discuss military affairs inside and outside the customs. He returned to Beiping that evening.</p>
<p>[Our Fanyang Dispatch, 10th] Fu Zuoyi arrived in Pan by plane on the morning of the 10th to meet with Chen Cheng to discuss the current military situation.</p>
<p>[Our Panyang Dispatch, 10th] The battle of Gongzhuling northeast of Xinmin on the north bank of the Liao River on the 7th was a major decisive battle in this offensive. The bandit troops suffered heavy casualties. According to military sources, the bandits suffered approximately 40,000 casualties from the 5th to the 8th. The main force of the bandit's Fourth Brigade is now at Shendan Fort, 35 kilometers southwest of Sujiatun. A portion crossed the railway and headed towards the Shenyang-Anshan line. Furthermore, bandits attempting to harass Yingkou were repelled on the 9th, with a portion fleeing towards Haicheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The National Army on the western Liaoning front has achieved brilliant war results, defeating the strength of five bandit brigades, killing or wounding over 40,000 bandits, and capturing over 1,000 bandits. Since the 5th, the communist bandits have gathered approximately 150,000 troops from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 10th Brigades, as well as the 2nd Independent Division of Northern Manchuria, and launched a large-scale offensive towards Gongzhuling, Huangjiashan, Paoziyan, Zhoujiatun, Juliuhe, and other places on the west bank of the Liao River, applying significant pressure and adopting a counter-encirclement on the right flank. At the same time, our air force repeatedly assisted in the battle, greatly boosting morale. The battle situation was extremely fierce. Under the combined attacks of land and air forces, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. By dawn on the 8th, they began to flee in disarray. In this battle, a total of five brigades of communist bandits were defeated, namely the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 10th, killing or wounding over 40,000 bandits, capturing over 1,000 bandits, and seizing countless military supplies. This battle was perhaps the largest annihilation battle encountered by the bandits since they started their incursions.</p>

The Soviet Union hopes to retain the veto power of the great powers in the peace conference with Japan, which the United States still does not support.</p>
<h3>False Report of Stalin's Death Briefly Draws Attention from All Circles in Nanjing and Shanghai; Reuters Has Voluntarily Corrected and Apologized</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The news of Stalin's death, which originated from Berne, the capital of free Switzerland, has attracted global attention, but has not yet been confirmed, and Moscow has remained silent. The local English-language Free Tribune published the news of "Stalin is Dead" on the front page yesterday morning with a large headline. The source of the news was Reuters, which stated: "According to Reuters, Moscow Radio announced Stalin's death at 2:30 AM on Saturday." As soon as the news was published, it immediately attracted attention from all circles. As a result, after various investigations, the news was not accurate, and Reuters authorities were the first to voluntarily deny it. According to the agency's explanation, the issuance of the news was due to a misunderstanding, which was caused by a reporter of the agency misreading a torn wireless telegram and notifying the newspaper office by telephone. The original telegram stated: "American newspapers published telegrams from abroad stating that it is widely rumored that Marshal Stalin has died in Moscow." However, a report denying the news was subsequently received.</p>
<p>Reuters expressed its sincere apologies for the incorrect report. The local Soviet authorities made no comment on this matter, believing that the denial of the news could be made by Reuters itself. After the "News of Stalin's Death" was published yesterday, many "comedic" things almost happened. After reading the newspaper, a diplomat from a certain country was about to go to the Soviet consulate to offer condolences, but gave up after a colleague inquired with the newspaper office and found it to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] The "New China Daily" in Nanjing published an extra edition at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, reporting the news of Stalin's death. Almost the entire first page of the extra edition was filled with reports about Stalin, including a detailed biography of his life. It also stated that rumors of Stalin's illness had been circulating for several months. The newspaper claimed that Stalin passed away at 2:30 AM on the 10th (Moscow time). The source of the news was "Shanghai Telegrams," but details about the death and how Shanghai received the news were omitted.</p>
<p>Listening to Moscow Radio broadcasts at 3:00 PM this afternoon, there was no news about Stalin.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Qi Hezhen, the Soviet Deputy Consul General in Beiping, denied the rumors that Stalin was suffering from right hemiplegia, saying that this was malicious slander, and said: Stalin sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Chiang on New Year's Day this year, which can serve as proof to the contrary.</p>
<h3>The Designation of Beiping as the Auxiliary Capital Inspires the People of the North; He Siyuan Says He is Determined to Work Hard for Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] After the Executive Yuan officially designated Beiping as the auxiliary capital, Mayor He Siyuan issued a statement saying: Beiping is a military, political, and economic hub, and especially the cultural center of the Far East. The government's official designation of Beiping as the auxiliary capital demonstrates the great importance it attaches to the North. I believe that the people of North China will also feel the same excitement upon hearing this news. During this time of suppression of the rebellion, Beiping's mission is particularly important. We should unite more, work harder, and be more vigilant to complete the tasks that Beiping should fulfill. The city's urban plan has always aimed at building Beiping into a modern capital. In the future, we will strive to advance towards this goal, so that Beiping can advance from being the auxiliary capital to becoming the capital. According to the facts of modern Chinese history, all times when Beiping was the capital were after major turmoil. I believe that the government's designation of Beiping as the auxiliary capital this time will also be a sign that the country will soon achieve unification. I am willing to encourage this with my fellow countrymen in North China.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Beiping City Council, said: The passage of the Executive Yuan's decision to designate Beiping as the auxiliary capital makes the people of the North feel grateful. Although it may seem empty, the impact is very good. Beiping should now be renamed Beijing. The council has decided to telegraph the central government tomorrow to make this suggestion.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Hu Shi said that he was very happy to hear that the Executive Yuan had passed the decision to designate Beiping as the auxiliary capital, and he hoped that in the future, at least when Nanjing is hot in the summer, the political center could be moved to Beiping for three or four months each year.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Draft Implementation Measures for the Industrial Part of the Economic Program</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The draft implementation measures for the industrial part of the economic reform program has been formulated by the relevant agencies. The key points are as follows:</p>
<p>Original Program: Adapting to the Needs of Morning Villages. Implementation Measures: 1. Prioritize the supply of building materials, irrigation machinery, and pipeline equipment needed for farmland water conservancy construction projects. 2. Increase the production of chemical fertilizers, supplying half of the national demand within three years, and achieving self-sufficiency within six years (the current annual demand is 450,000 tons). Expand existing factories and establish new factories. 3. Establish agricultural tool manufacturing plants in various counties across the country and encourage private operation. 4. Launch private factories to manufacture small trains, ships, and other vehicles to develop rural transportation.</p>
<p>Original Program: The Focus of Industrial Development. Implementation Measures: (A) 1. Solid fuels: Encourage people to open their own coal mines, strengthen production in the three regions of Northeast China, North China, and Taiwan, and develop coal production in Central China, South China, and Southwest China. It is hoped that national coal production will reach 25 million tons in 1948, 30 million tons in 1949, and 35 million tons in 1950. 2. Liquid fuels: Increase the production of the Yumen and Shantou oilfields so that they can meet the needs of the Northwest within one year. Increase the production of the Jinxi and Taiwan oil refineries so that they can meet the needs of North China, Northeast China, Southeast China, Central China, and South China within one year. New wells should be added in Gansu, and oil refining equipment should be added. The Southwest provinces lack gasoline supply and should make full use of alcohol. 3. Power generation equipment should be actively increased in various places, and those with important industrial needs should be enriched first. It is hoped that by 1950, Shanghai can generate 285,400 kilowatts, Nanjing 63,000 kilowatts, Hankou 38,250 kilowatts, Guangzhou 108,500 kilowatts, Chongqing 21,000 kilowatts, Qingdao 60,000 kilowatts, Hebei 169,400 kilowatts, and Northeast China can reach 352,500 kilowatts by 1951. For hydroelectric power, the Xiaofengman power plant should be improved first. The ongoing hydroelectric power projects should be completed accordingly. (B) 1. Conduct zonal surveys of mineral deposits and actively exploit them. The target progress for 1948 for important minerals is: tin 7,000 tons, mercury 80 tons, tungsten 10,000 tons, antimony 8,000 tons, gold 100,000 taels, copper 1,000 tons, aluminum 1,500 tons, zinc 800 tons, manganese 50,000 tons, lead 6,000 tons, magnesite 50,000 tons, alum 100,000 tons, iron 2 million tons, phosphate rock 50,000 tons, and fluorite 2,000 tons. 2. Focus on increasing the production of minerals that can be exported and precious metals that can be used as a currency fund. Encourage private operation and adjust government procurement methods. 3. For mines with existing foundations such as copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, and magnesium, production should be promoted, and the aluminum smelting and aluminum manufacturing industries in Taiwan should be advanced. 4. Supervise the increase in production of mineral products such as iron, manganese, aluminum, and magnesium related to copper and iron industries, and basic industrial raw materials such as pyrite. 5. Radioactive minerals are entirely operated by the government, and their sales and transportation are strictly controlled. (C) For copper and iron production, efforts must be made to meet half of the national needs within three years. Special convenience should be given to the turnover of funds, the supply of raw materials, and the transportation of finished products. 2. Supervise the increase in cement production and pay attention to exports. (D) Establish machinery manufacturing plants in major industrial zones to manufacture in large quantities. (E) Essential industrial raw materials and equipment that cannot be produced domestically should be imported and stored from abroad.</p>
<p>Original Program: Developing People's Livelihood Industries. Implementation Measures: 1. Cotton textile industry: Use existing spindles to complete a production capacity of 4.5 million spindles, add new factories in cotton-producing areas, increase by 3 million spindles within five years, and increase to 12.5 million spindles within ten years. The wool textile industry currently has 110,000 spindles and should increase by 100,000 spindles within five years and 200,000 spindles within the second five years. The ramie textile industry should establish machine textile factories in ramie-producing areas. The ramie cloth should be increased to 40,000 spindles in the first five years and 120,000 spindles in the second five years. The existing 6,400 ramie bag textile machines should be increased by 10,000 spindles in the first five years and 20,000 spindles in the second five years. The existing 26,000 silk spindles should be increased by 100,000 spindles within ten years. In terms of technology, the competent authorities will guide improvements, set product standards, encourage the manufacture of new textile machines, and the competent authorities will coordinate the rational allocation of raw material substitution and finished product sales. 2. The flour and oil manufacturing industries should be expanded and improved, sugar production should be increased, canneries, refrigeration, drying, pickling, and sweetening industries should be established, and chemical industries related to food should also be established to manufacture their own products. 3. The salt production industry should improve the refining methods and expand the production of by-products. 4. The paper industry should be rewarded and assisted, mechanical pulp mills should be promoted, and the government should promote the manufacture of copper wire cloth and blankets for paper making. 5. The printing industry should be mechanized, and efforts should be made to manufacture and supply raw materials domestically. 6. For the wood needed for the construction industry, the government should encourage private companies to manufacture it in large quantities. 7. Local governments should handle or support private operation as much as possible for the construction of short-distance transportation.</p>
<p>Original Program: Scope of State-Owned and Private Operation. Implementation Measures: The scope of state-owned and private operation should be re-determined with reference to the Industrial Construction Conference and the Five-Year Material Construction Plan, based on the actual damage to industries in the recovered areas and the available reparation goods, so as to achieve proper coordination and achieve the highest efficiency.</p>
<p>Original Program: Areas for Industrial Construction. Implementation Measures: The division of construction areas should still refer to the agricultural, industrial, mining, transportation, resources, natural environment, customs, habits, and social conditions of various places, and refer to the research results of various agencies in the past, which will be studied in detail by the relevant ministries and commissions before a decision is made.</p>
<p>Original Program: Supporting Small-Scale Industries. Implementation Measures: Small industries and handicrafts should be earnestly supported and improved according to local conditions. The supply of raw materials and the sale of finished products should be centrally managed, and special handicrafts should be rewarded for establishing export organizations. In terms of technology, the government should set standards to improve quality and provide loan facilities.</p>
<p>Original Program: Increasing International Exports. Implementation Measures: Exported products should emphasize processed products from an industrial standpoint, and replace semi-finished products and raw materials with finished product exports as much as possible. (Continued on page two)</p>
<h3>Difficult to Reduce Expenditures During the Suppression of the Rebellion; The Government Decides to Focus on Increasing Revenue; Xu Baiyuan Discusses Measures to Rectify Tax Collection</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan said: The government is determined to balance revenue and expenditure, but because it is difficult to reduce expenditures on military affairs for suppressing the rebellion and the destruction by the communist bandits, it focuses on increasing revenue, mainly by rectifying tax collection. There are four strategies for rectifying tax collection: 1. Collect taxes according to changes in prices. For example, the commodity tax, which used to be adjusted every three months, is now adjusted every month. 2. Implement pre-collection measures. For example, income tax will follow the British pre-collection method, which will be settled later. 3. Adjust tariffs. Except for the regular tax, which is limited by international tariff agreements and cannot be changed, the surtax will be increased from 5% to 50%. In addition, wartime tax exemptions for gasoline, diesel, and kerosene will also be restored. 4. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will authorize the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to adjust tax rates at any time according to price increases. Regarding local finances, there have been many difficulties in the past, with subsidies from the central government reaching more than 82%. Starting this year, efforts will be stepped up to rectify the land tax, of which the original central government portion (30%) will be reallocated to the provinces to enrich local financial resources. At the same time, local tax collection will be rectified. For example, the collection of business tax has been poor after being allocated to local governments. In the future, it should be earnestly rectified to increase revenue. In this way, the financial situation of local governments will improve, and the central government will no longer need to subsidize them. In short, regardless of whether there is foreign aid, the rectification of tax collection is an urgent task at present. If tax collection is successful and finances can be put on track, otherwise, even if the currency system is reformed, and revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, finances will not be stable after the issuance of the new currency.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The issue of land tax revenue being allocated to the provinces and counties has been approved by the Executive Yuan. It is understood that the implementation period will be after the start of constitutional government, because the grain year is from September of each year to the end of August of the following year. The current collection is still of last year's land tax, so the implementation of this measure will be after the implementation of constitutional government. In addition, after the land tax is allocated to local governments, the duties of the Ministry of Food will still include the important tasks of regulating food for the people and coordinating military grain, so there will be no changes in the organizational structure.</p>
<h3>Expanded Food Rationing in Five Cities Can Begin in March</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The plan formulated by the Ministry of Food to implement expanded rationing in the five major cities of Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and to raise food sources, has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and is being reviewed by Premier Zhang Qun. It is understood that the main point is to purchase foreign rice to make up for the insufficient food supply. The amount listed in the plan is 50 tons, which is the amount needed for eight months. In addition to the grain purchased by the China Grain Corporation and the grain purchased by the China Trust Bureau from the Executive Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the existing public education grain, there is still a shortage of 250,000 tons. The government originally allocated 200,000 tons of foreign rice to the Ministry of Food for purchase, and the remaining 50,000 tons can be purchased domestically. However, the purchase of foreign rice requires a huge amount of foreign exchange, so a report has been prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan, and discussions are underway with Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank. Zhang said that it can be purchased in batches, but the Executive Yuan has not yet approved it, and the Ministry of Food has no way to comply. It is now working on preparations for the rationing procedures. Once the Executive Yuan approves it and sends it to the ministry, it can begin. A spokesman for the Ministry of Food said: The authorities are determined to implement it as soon as possible, so it may begin in March.</p>

These measures have been submitted to the National Government for approval and reported to the State Council meeting on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Kowloon City House Demolition Issue: Hong Kong Government Offers One-Sided Explanation; Yeh Kung-ch'ao Discussed Matter with Hong Kong Governor Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 10th] The Hong Kong government issued a statement today explaining that the demolition of wooden houses in the old Kowloon City area is to safeguard the health and lives of residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon. For more than a year, the Hong Kong government has been pursuing a policy of removing residents occupying crown land in various areas, because they are detrimental to public health. The procedure adopted this time in Kowloon is based on this policy. Before implementation, the Hong Kong authorities gave the occupants adequate notice and informed them of relocation options, encouraging them to apply for new housing. No force was used during the execution of the removal order, and only one person was slightly injured when a house collapsed.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government's statement did not mention Kuo Teh-hua, Special Commissioner for Kwangtung and Kwangsi of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated that the Chinese government would hold the Hong Kong government responsible for the demolition of the houses and reserve the right to demand compensation. It is generally believed that the Hong Kong government's statement is a rejection of Kuo's demands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 10th] After being dispatched to Rangoon to attend the Burmese Independence Day celebrations, Vice Minister Yeh Kung-ch'ao suddenly visited here today, met with Hong Kong Governor Grantham for an hour to discuss the matter. Before the meeting he declared to representatives of the Kowloon City residents that the Chinese and Hong Kong governments would cooperate to resolve the house demolition issue. Upon hearing this, the residents' emotions have calmed down. At the same time, the Hong Kong government issued a statement today denying the existence of jurisdictional rights in Kowloon City.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] Vice Minister Yeh Kung-ch'ao arrived in Guangzhou at 5:00 PM on the 10th from Hong Kong on a special plane, accompanied by Kuo Teh-hua, Special Commissioner for Kwangtung and Kwangsi. According to Yeh, he has never given up sovereignty over Kowloon City.</p>
<h3>Currency Reform Plan Finalized: Divided into Exchange Standard and Silver Standard, Pei Tsu-yi to Discuss and Decide with Americans</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 10th] Rumors of currency reform have been circulating for a long time, but have only recently become concrete. According to highly reliable sources, the Ministry of Finance has finalized a concrete plan for currency reform and submitted it to President Chiang for review. This plan will be taken to the United States by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi to be studied in detail with American financial figures and monetary experts, because if the currency reform is decided to be implemented, it cannot succeed without American assistance. Observers point out that among the personnel accompanying Mr. Pei to the United States is currency expert Chu Pao-chen, which proves that Mr. Pei's trip carries the task of studying with the Americans, and even negotiating for American assistance in currency reform. Government officials here feel that in order to remedy the current problem of constantly rising prices and the continuous devaluation of legal tender, the only way is currency reform, so all parties hope that Mr. Pei's trip will achieve success in the area of currency.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 10th] Qualified figures in the financial community recently discussed the currency reform issue, stating: The government's plan for currency reform can be roughly divided into two parts: exchange standard and silver standard, but which method will ultimately be used to reform the currency will depend on American aid. The plan that Mr. Pei is taking to the United States this time includes both methods. After arriving in the United States, the decision will be made based on which method the Americans adopt. If an exchange standard is adopted, the United States will lend us more than 300 million US dollars to serve as a foreign exchange fund. If it is a silver standard, it also seems possible that the Americans will adopt it, because the United States has a silver surplus. At the same time, the national treasury has a lot of silver reserves, and if we continue to use silver coins in the future, we can restore the credit of silver dollars. If the United States adopts a silver standard, then it will lend us silver equivalent to 300 million US dollars, so which method will be adopted in the future depends on the reality of American aid to China.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 10th] Pei Tsu-yi, head of the technical delegation to the United States, has decided to fly to the United States from Shanghai on the 14th. He has been in Nanking for several days, contacting the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, and other agencies, and the collection of necessary information has been completed. He took the night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 10th, and after a brief preparation, he will depart for the United States. When this newspaper's reporter visited Mr. Pei before his departure, Mr. Pei only said: He decided to fly to the United States on the 14th. He avoided answering the reporter's questions about American aid. When the reporter asked whether Mr. Pei's trip was to contact the Americans about currency reform, Mr. Pei smiled and said: "You know more about this issue than I do." Mr. Pei said: Most of the information he is taking this time is related to finance, economy, and transportation, and is very comprehensive. Regarding the length of his stay in the United States, Mr. Pei said: It is difficult to predict at this time, and everything will be done according to the government's instructions. When Mr. Pei left Nanking, Foreign Minister Wang, represented by Liu Shih-shun, and China Bank Manager Peng Hu, all went to the station to see him off.</p>
<h3>Details of American Aid to China Nearing Completion; Marshall Awaits Meeting with Yu and Pei; Monetary Issues Awaiting Final Decision</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall announced at a press conference today: I intend to personally meet with the Chinese technical representatives Yu Ta-wei and Pei Tsu-yi to consult on American aid to China. The State Department said: Yu and Pei are expected to arrive in Washington this week, but the Chinese Embassy said that it may be delayed somewhat, and it is difficult to predict when they will arrive. Marshall also said: The American government's aid to China plan may require approximately 300 million yuan in expenses over fifteen months starting in April. The details have been drafted and are now awaiting final decision. The final decision is related to other government departments and is a complex monetary issue. When asked whether the aid to China plan could be submitted to Congress for discussion within a few weeks, Marshall replied: I am afraid that there will not be such a long delay.</p>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 9th] The Saturday Evening Post editorial stated: "Our policy toward China is still unclear." The Republican Party has its reasons for being anxious about China. All efforts to unite President Chiang and the Communists have failed, "but we do not seem to have begun another lesson." But if the United States delays and decides to contact Moscow, what will happen? Four hundred and fifty million Chinese people will be armed, industrialized, and ruled for the historical benefit of the war.</p>

<h3>A Study of the True Value of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>— Chang Pai-yi</p>
<p>Since the late period of the War of Resistance to the present, the value of Chinese legal tender has gradually fallen into a long-term decline. Moreover, the existence of speculative markets in major cities, the existence of a small number of treacherous individuals intentionally hoarding and speculating, and the existence of the behavior of the majority of the people unintentionally speculating and vying to purchase unnecessary or non-urgent materials, have caused the issue of the value of legal tender to fall into chaos.</p>
<p>Until recently, prices have increased by an average of 120,000 to 130,000 times compared to pre-war levels. In other words, one pre-war yuan of legal tender is roughly equivalent to 120,000 to 130,000 yuan of legal tender today. Is this standard reasonable? This is a big question.</p>
<p>If we use the Quantity Theory of Money to study the true value of legal tender today, the conclusion we reach will inevitably negate today's value standard for legal tender. Because although legal tender today is in a state of inflation and its value is gradually depreciating, the degree of its depreciation is definitely not as low as today's market standard.</p>
<p>Economist Huang Yuan-bin recently gave a speech in Guangzhou, stating that since around October of last year, every time the amount of legal tender issued doubles, prices rise tenfold. Therefore, the reason for the high rise in prices is, generally speaking, one-tenth due to the increased issuance of legal tender, and nine-tenths due to the people's lack of faith in legal tender. Indeed, according to my research, the reason why the market value of legal tender is so low today is due to the national psychology of excessively suppressing legal tender. If the national psychology towards legal tender could be changed, then the value of legal tender would definitely not fall to such a low level.</p>
<p>If we now study the Real Value of legal tender, we must first understand the following two figures:</p>
<p>1.  The cumulative amount of national fiscal deficits of the National Government since the War of Resistance, and the total amount of legal tender issued estimated from this.</p>
<p>2.  The amount of currency in circulation in various countries before and after World War II—especially those countries with closer economic ties to China—and the true standard for measuring today's exchange rate of Chinese legal tender.</p>
<p>If we can obtain the above two main real figures, then we can immediately measure the true value of legal tender today.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the amount of national fiscal deficits of the National Government since the War of Resistance. According to statistics from various sources, the figures are as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: millions of legal tender)</p>
<p>Republic Year 26 (1937): 495.936</p>
<p>Republic Year 27 (1938) (Half Year): 395.650</p>
<p>Republic Year 28 (1939): 1,383.180</p>
<p>Republic Year 29 (1940): 4,007.156</p>
<p>Republic Year 30 (1941): 9,013.599</p>
<p>Republic Year 31 (1942): 19,777.034</p>
<p>Republic Year 32 (1943): 12,994.045</p>
<p>Republic Year 33 (1944): 53,896.156</p>
<p>Republic Year 34 (1945): 72,245.711</p>
<p>Republic Year 35 (1946): 939,113.443</p>
<p>Republic Year 36 (1947): 22,600,000.000</p>
<p>(Note: The figures for Republic Year 26 to Republic Year 32 are based on the Ministry of Finance's actual receipts and expenditures. The figures for Republic Year 33 to Republic Year 35 are based on the Financial Daily. The figure for Republic Year 36 is based on recent reports).</p>
<p>According to the table above, from Republic Year 26 to Republic Year 36, the cumulative amount of fiscal deficits in the past eleven years is 23,713,321,910,000 yuan. (Note: Wan Yi Ri Zhao). This amount is the accumulated amount of national fiscal deficits over the years. Although a portion of it has been made up by public bonds, the amount is not large. For the sake of simple calculation, we can take this number as the cumulative amount of Central Bank treasury withdrawals in the past eleven years, and it can also be taken as the cumulative amount of legal tender issued by the Central Bank in the past eleven years.</p>
<p>The amount of legal tender issued before the War of Resistance was 1.4 billion yuan. Adding the accumulated amount issued over the years, we can estimate that the amount of legal tender in circulation in Republic Year 36 is approximately 23,713,321,470,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The amount of legal tender issued before the war was 1.4 billion yuan, as mentioned earlier. Today it is 23,713,321,470,000 yuan, an increase of approximately 17,000 times. Assuming that we use the quantity of currency to convert the true value of legal tender before the war, then 17,000 yuan of legal tender today should be equal to one yuan of legal tender before the war. But according to today's special prices, the increase is about 120,000 to 130,000 times compared to pre-war levels, which means that one yuan of legal tender before the war will be equal to 120,000 to 130,000 yuan of legal tender today. The great distance between them proves this, and it can also point out the impropriety of the people's excessive underestimation of the value of legal tender today.</p>
<p>Second, let's look at the currency circulation figures of major countries before and after World War II. According to the United Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, the amount of currency in circulation in the United States was approximately 6 billion US dollars in 1937, and approximately 27.1 billion US dollars in August 1947. In the United Kingdom, the figure increased from 505 million pounds to 1.393 billion pounds during the same period. In India, the figure increased from 1.8 billion rupees to 11.8 billion rupees during the same period. In France, the figure increased from 94 billion francs to 832 billion francs during the same period. In Canada, the figure increased from 207 million Canadian dollars to 1.008 billion Canadian dollars during the same period. In Australia, the figure increased from 54 million Australian pounds to 206 million Australian pounds during the same period. This means that in the recent past compared to 1937 before the war, the amount of currency in circulation in the United States has increased by approximately 3.5 times. In the United Kingdom, the figure has increased by approximately 1 and 3/4 times. In India, the figure has increased by approximately 5.5 times. In France, the figure has increased by approximately 8 times. In Canada, the figure has increased by approximately 4 times. In Australia, the figure has increased by approximately 3 times.</p>
<p>Of particular note is the amount of currency in circulation in the United States, because the economic relationship between the United States and China is currently the closest, and it is also the world's economic leader. During and after the war, the trend of Chinese people vying to purchase US dollars was very strong, and our foreign exchange often used US exchange rates as a standard. However, the actual purchasing power of US currency has decreased due to the increase in circulation, and this fact does not seem to have been noticed by the general public in China. The detailed statistics on the amount of currency in circulation in the United States reported by the Federal Reserve Bulletin (September 1947) are listed below:</p>
<p>Statistics on the amount of US Coin and Small Denomination Currency in Circulation (Unit: millions of US dollars)</p>
<p>Statistics on the amount of US Large Denomination Currency in Circulation (Unit: millions of US dollars)</p>
<p>(This table is based on the Federal Reserve Bulletin, September 1947)</p>
<p>According to the table above, it can be seen that the amount of currency in circulation in the United States at the end of August 1947 was 28,149 million US dollars, an increase of approximately 3 and 1/3 times compared to the 6,550 million US dollars at the end of 1937. If coins are removed, the figure increases from 6,001.3 million US dollars to 26,793 million US dollars, an increase of approximately 3.5 times. Of particular note is that the rate of increase of large denomination notes is greater than that of small denomination notes. Comparing the end of August 1947 with the end of 1937, the increase in US dollar notes of 1 yuan, 2 yuan, and 5 yuan is approximately 1 time, but the 10 yuan note has increased 3 times, the 20 yuan note has increased 5 times, the 50 yuan note has increased approximately 5.5 times, the 100 yuan note has increased approximately 6 times, the 500 yuan note has increased approximately 2 times, and the 1,000 yuan note has increased approximately 2 times. That is, the increase rate from 10 yuan to 1,000 yuan is approximately 4 times greater than the average increase rate from 1 yuan to 5 yuan. In 1947, the past circulation amount of 10 yuan to 1,000 yuan notes totaled 23,676 million US dollars, an increase of more than 4 times compared to the circulation amount of the above-mentioned notes in 1937 of 4,554 million US dollars. The fact that there is inflation in the United States can be proven by this.</p>
<p>As a result of inflation in the United States, the US price and cost of living index have naturally risen accordingly. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, the US cost of living index increased from 100.8 in 1937 to 157.1 in June 1947. Among them, food increased from 105.3 to 193.2 in July 1947, and clothing increased from 102.8 to 185.7 during the same period. (Using the average of 1937-39 as 100) At the same time, according to the US Federal Reserve Bulletin, the US wholesale price index in July 1947 compared to 1937 showed that agricultural products increased from 86 to 181, food increased from 86 to 162, and other commodities increased from 85 to 134. (1926 was 100)</p>
<p>Therefore, if we estimate based on the quantity of currency in circulation in the United States, one US dollar today should only be equal to 25 cents of US currency before the war. If we estimate based on prices, one US dollar today is only equal to 50 cents before the war. According to my compromise estimate, one US dollar today is approximately equal to 33 cents of US currency before the war. Before the war, 3 yuan of Chinese legal tender could be exchanged for one US dollar, so one US dollar today is approximately equal to one yuan of Chinese legal tender before the war. The true value of Chinese legal tender today should be 17,000 yuan, which is approximately equal to one yuan of legal tender before the war. Therefore, 17,000 yuan of legal tender today is actually equivalent to one US dollar today.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that measuring the true value of legal tender based on the amount of legal tender issued in China will result in 17,000 yuan of legal tender today being equal to one yuan of legal tender before the war. Measuring the true value of legal tender based on the amount of currency in circulation in the United States will result in 17,000 yuan of legal tender today being equal to one US dollar today. That is, 3 US dollars today are equal to one US dollar before the war, because before the war, 3 yuan of Chinese legal tender was equivalent to one US dollar. Therefore, one US dollar today is actually equal to one yuan of Chinese legal tender before the war.</p>
<p>However, why is the exchange rate of legal tender to the US dollar set as high as 90,000 legal tender to one US dollar by the Exchange Stabilization Fund? And why is the black market exchange rate even higher than this number? At the same time, why has the multiple by which prices have increased in China reached as high as 120,000 to 130,000 times?</p>
<p>According to my research, the factor that is promoting this unreasonable phenomenon is not Chinese legal tender itself, but rather the lack of trust in legal tender by the people. This is truly a fatal injury to the national economy! Because most people do not believe that legal tender can be stabilized, they cannot maintain the habit of saving before the war and deposit their surplus income in banks. Therefore, it can be said that all of the legal tender in circulation is roaming the market, and the speed of circulation is much faster than usual. The result of legal tender roaming the market is inevitably a gradual decrease in the amount of goods existing in the market. Due to the great distance between the amount of legal tender in circulation and the amount of goods existing in the market, prices rise every moment and fluctuate all the time, causing the purchasing power of legal tender to decrease day by day and step by step fall into the deep abyss of vicious inflation!</p>
<p>The fact is this: Before the war, the amount of legal tender in circulation was 1.4 billion yuan, while bank deposits consistently remained around 2.6 billion yuan. But today, the amount of legal tender in circulation is 23 trillion, but commercial bank deposits are instead low at only 2-3 trillion yuan. Even including the four major banks, it is probably no more than 10 trillion yuan; and most of it is short-term deposits. In fact, it can be said that there are no time deposits or savings deposits.</p>
<p>At the same time, US dollars themselves have gradually devalued by two-thirds due to inflation, but US dollars circulating in China have instead assisted the American currency in its special advantageous position in China due to the Chinese people's purchases and savings. According to the Central Bank's announcement, the total number of US dollars held by people in Shanghai has increased tenfold compared to before the war. But the ten times the amount of US dollars actually only increases its actual value by 3.5 times compared to before the war, because US dollars today are devalued by two-thirds compared to US dollars before the war.</p>
<p>In addition, what is even more noteworthy is that the Chinese wealthy class is converting legal tender into foreign currency and fleeing overseas, to the United States in the distant, and to Hong Kong in the near, which is also a major reason for weakening the value of legal tender. These people are all traitors to the country!</p>
<p>It is actually not difficult for us to maintain the stability of legal tender and restore its value. I suggest a few methods as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The government must immediately announce the principle of balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure. From now on, it must heavily tax the wealthy and solicit public bonds, and never rely on issuance to make up for its deficits. At the same time, it must vigorously implement this principle. Finally, it must re-enforce the Central Bank's issuance inspection system, with the participation of social legal entities, and make public reports at any time.</p>
<p>2.  The government should actively encourage people to save, and order national banks and treasuries to use various methods to absorb a large number of time deposits.</p>
<p>3.  The government should vigorously implement foreign exchange control, absolutely prohibit the trading of US dollars and other foreign currencies, and announce that foreign exchange is returned to state ownership, including all overseas deposits. (During the war, the United Kingdom announced the nationalization of foreign exchange.)</p>
<p>4.  The government should declare that international trade is entirely state-owned when necessary.</p>
<p>5.  The government should set up a price evaluation committee, and the prices should be uniformly approved and not changed for at least one month.</p>
<p>6.  The people must absolutely obey the government's orders, and use their surplus income not to purchase unnecessary or non-urgent materials or US dollars and gold, but to deposit all their surplus funds in national banks.</p>
<p>7.  The people must absolutely obey the government's orders, and all foreign currencies and gold that can be exchanged for foreign exchange must be settled and retained by the government at the official price. (The United Kingdom announced this system during the war).</p>
<p>8.  The people must not freely change the prices stipulated by the government.</p>
<p>If the government and the people truly cooperate, if the government does not view the people as all treacherous merchants, and the people do not view officials as all corrupt, and they trust and cooperate with each other, then prices will definitely be stable. After prices are stable, the government can prepare for currency reform. The government must give special preference to depositors of time deposits and savings deposits in national banks for the exchange rate of the new currency for legal tender. For example: Assuming that every 100,000 legal tender is combined into one new currency, then it may be possible to combine 50,000 legal tender into one new currency for depositors of savings deposits (the Soviet Union recently used this method to reform the currency). This would further encourage people to save enthusiastically before currency reform and accelerate the stabilization of legal tender.</p>
<p>In short, although our country's internal turmoil has not been settled at present, our country's productivity has increased greatly compared to before the war. At the same time, since the recovery of the resource-rich Northeast and Taiwan, our country's material storage has also increased more than tenfold compared to before the war. At the same time, our country has a population of about 500 million, of which at least 125 million are the main labor force. If the industrial technology problem is solved, China will definitely not have the concern of poverty. Human and material resources are the basic source of national wealth and vitality. China has such huge human and material resources, why worry about poverty? Therefore, I hope that the government will first have enlightened fiscal and economic policies, and that the loyal and patriotic people will sincerely cooperate and implement them earnestly. Chinese legal tender can be saved, and China's economic prospects are not necessarily pessimistic.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Expedite the Provision of Military Grain</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 10th] Since the bandit troubles have not subsided and the mobilization to suppress the rebellion is the established national policy, the Jiangsu Provincial Government considers that having sufficient food and soldiers is a prerequisite. It has recently telegraphed to the governments of all counties (cities) that, in the future, for the military grain to be allocated, regardless of whether it is provincial, county, or central government grain taxes, they should expedite the handling and allocation to meet military needs.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Grain Merchants Hold Meeting in Wuxi to Request Exemption from Grain Business Tax Again</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Representatives of grain merchants from various counties in Jiangsu Province held an emergency meeting at the Wuxi Grain Association at 2:00 PM today to discuss the issue of exemption from grain business tax. Twenty-four representatives from twenty-one units including Suzhou, Changshu, Wujin, Jiangyin, Nantong, Qingpu, and Xuzhou attended. They decided to jointly recommend representatives from nine counties including Suxi and Chang to go to Shanghai on the 16th to meet with representatives of the National Grain Merchants Association and submit a petition to the capital for the second time, requesting exemption from grain business tax. A preparatory committee was formed to organize the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Merchants Federation, and Zhao Zhijie and 14 others were appointed as preparatory members.</p>
<h3>Reports on Grain Prices</h3>
<p>At the same time, the representatives reported the price situation in various counties as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangyin white japonica rice 1.45 million, Jiangyan glutinous rice 1.1 million, Yangzhou late rice 1.24 million, Nanjing white rice 1.12 million, Lishui indica rice 1 million, Changshu limited price 1.18 million, Suzhou limited price 1.18 million, Wuxi limited price 1.18 million, Changzhou limited price 1.18 million, Nantong indica rice 1.5 million, Xinghua indica rice 980,000, Jinshan white japonica rice 1.25 million, Qingpu white japonica rice 1.37 million, Gaoyou indica rice 410,000, Songjiang white millet 1.4 million, Taizhou indica rice 440,000, Danyang medium-ripe rice 1.25 million, Baoying white japonica rice 1.15 million, Jingjiang indica rice 1.2 million, Jintan white indica rice 1.1 million, Xuzhou wheat 1.4 million,</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Marriage Problems Are Serious: Chen Qingyun Discusses His Observations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch dated the 10th] The marriage problems of overseas Chinese are extremely serious. It is hoped that the government can negotiate with various countries to allow overseas Chinese dependents to enter the country. This is what Overseas Minister Chen Qingyun said to reporters after inspecting and comforting overseas Chinese in the United States, Canada, and North and South America after returning to the country. Minister Chen said: Due to the restrictions on Chinese people entering various countries in North and South America, it is even more difficult for overseas Chinese dependents to enter. Overseas Chinese individuals are far away from their motherland and often reside for more than ten years without being able to bring their families, which is not in line with human nature. Therefore, the majority of overseas Chinese have no choice but to marry local indigenous women. This situation is most prevalent in Central and South America.

<h3>Multiple U.S. Warships Transferred to Turkey to Strengthen Defense of the Dardanelles Strait and Prevent Communist Forces from Extending into the Mediterranean Sea</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington dispatch dated the 9th] The United States today supported the defense of the Dardanelles Strait by transferring four fleet-type submarines to Turkey, plus eleven other warships, especially suitable for the mission in this Middle Eastern strategic area. Fleet-type warships are giant new-type submarines with extremely long underwater endurance. They have ten torpedo tubes and can carry a crew of 65 people. This week, the old warships that the United States has supplied to the Turkish and Greek fleets have reached 33. The Navy Department's announcement today is the culmination of a series of diplomatic actions to let the Soviet Union and its Balkan satellite countries know that any action that would change the balance of power in this historically "powder keg" area would inevitably have serious consequences. Rear Admiral Denfeld, the new head of the Navy Department, recently said that the U.S. fleet is the backing of the country's foreign policy. A U.S. Marine Corps team of 1,000 men, carrying full landing equipment, is heading to the Mediterranean to reinforce it. Vice Admiral Hewitt, former Chief of Staff of the Navy, will take office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet next month, stationed on the powerful aircraft carrier "Midway." The submarines supplied to Turkey today will be sailed to Turkish ports by U.S. Navy personnel. The other warships, including eight minesweepers and one net-laying ship, oil tanker, and repair ship, will be sailed by Turkish sailors trained in the country. Greece also received six artillery pieces today. Earlier, the State Department announced that it had sold eleven minesweepers to Greece. The transfer of the warships is included in the $450 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey passed by Congress last year. After Turkey receives four new submarines, its submarine strength will only be 14, which is still insignificant compared to the Soviet Union's 215. The actual deployment of the Soviet fleet is kept secret, but experts say that its main force is concentrated in Vladivostok, and there are also powerful fleets in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. The U.S. and Turkish submarines do not have long-term diving equipment, but the distance between the Dardanelles and the Black Sea is very short, so this equipment is not necessary. U.S. Navy experts told reporters that the main purpose of the submarines, in addition to showing off to the Soviet Union, is to further train Turkish sailors. These submarines can hinder enemy transport, and can travel long distances, so they are suitable for patrol work.</p>
<h3>The United States Is Concerned About the Situation in Greece; The Mediterranean Fleet Conducts a Ten-Day Exercise</h3>
<p>[Reuters Athens dispatch dated the 10th] The U.S. Embassy announced yesterday that the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet, including the 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Midway," three light cruisers, and several destroyers, will begin routine training exercises in the eastern Mediterranean and the Ionian Sea southwest of Greece from Wednesday until January 16. The 1,000 marines who departed from the United States on Sunday will soon be assigned to serve on these ships.</p>
<p>According to U.S. reports, these actions by the United States are actually a warning to Greece's neighbors, instructing them not to recognize Markos' "Free Greek Government." According to diplomatic reporters from this agency, the dispatch of the marine corps is a traditional signal from Washington that it will not hesitate to use force when necessary. Two days ago, the U.S. Department of State instructed its representatives in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to warn the two governments not to recognize Markos' government, stating that such actions would be considered a violation of the principles of the UN Charter. According to information received by the Greek government yesterday, the Comintern Intelligence Bureau recently discussed inviting the Greek Communist Party to join the bureau to replace the immediate recognition of the Markos government, presumably due to the firm attitude of the British and Americans and the failure of the Greek guerrillas to occupy considerable land.</p>
<h3>The United States Denies Requesting to Send Troops to the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington dispatch dated the 9th] The State Department stated that U.S. officials had informally discussed with the Palestinian government the possibility of sending U.S. Marines to Jerusalem to protect the U.S. Consulate there, but no resolution had been established. The State Department's official statement said: "The United States government has never requested the Palestinian government or the British government to allow the United States to send Marines to Palestine. This report from London may be due to informal discussions between the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem and the Palestinian government on the need to take measures to protect the safety of personnel and property of the consulate. During these discussions, the issue of sending U.S. guards was raised, but no resolution was established." The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem was recently bombed.</p>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem dispatch dated the 9th] Although the U.S. Consulate General here has officially denied the claim that the U.S. Marines will be transferred to Palestine, reliable sources here still insist that 300 U.S. Marines will be transferred to Palestine to serve as guards for the U.S. Consulate and to protect other U.S. buildings in Jerusalem and U.S. expatriates traveling on Palestinian highways.

<p>[Reuters London dispatch dated the 10th] The British Foreign Office has instructed its minister to Damascus, Broughter-Miter, to lodge a serious protest with the Syrian government regarding the invasion of Palestine by Arab armed forces from Syria. A Foreign Office spokesman said that Broughter-Miter had either acted on his own initiative or at the request of the Palestinian government to protest to the Syrian government. Diplomatic circles here are deeply concerned about yesterday's events in Palestine, fearing that the conflict in Palestine will become more widespread as a result. A recent dispatch from the Holy Land said that all 600 Arab troops who invaded Palestine from Syria yesterday had retreated into Syria, and the Palestinian government announced that the situation in Northern Xinjiang had returned to normal.</p>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem dispatch dated the 10th] Soldiers of the British Royal Commando Regiment, famous for their daring, began armed patrols on the banks of the Jordan River on the northern border of Palestine today, seemingly trying to stop the Arabs from invading the Holy Land, showing that British policy is gradually becoming tougher. The volunteer troops from Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are now being trained in southern Syria, and the partition conflict is likely to develop into an international incident. At the same time, 600 Arabs crossed the border and attacked Palestine yesterday, and were finally repelled by British troops and jet fighter squadrons. This attack may be the prelude to a general offensive launched by the Arabs, but Arab officials here say that it is not yet time to launch an offensive.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute: Opinions in The Hague</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this newspaper</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent’s Airmail from The Hague] At this time when the Indonesian question is extremely thorny, the government and public in The Hague express extraordinary concern about protecting the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The spokesman of the Dutch government's Colonial Department (now renamed the Overseas Department), Mr. Vlasman, with fourteen years of experience living in Indonesia, told the reporter about the profound friendship of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia towards him. He said, "The Chinese residents have made the greatest contribution to the development of the islands of Southeast Asia, and the Dutch government cannot ignore them." Mr. Vlasman's assistant, Mr. Heijningen, showed photographs of Indonesian Republican thugs killing overseas Chinese and a letter from the Chinese General Association of Batavia to the Dutch government, proving the various undisciplined states of the Indonesian Republic. Mr. Heijningen said, "The Dutch government sent troops to the East Indies purely to maintain law and order and protect the safety of good people." He firmly denied that there was any so-called war. "The Netherlands only has 100,000 troops in Indonesia, and this small number is definitely not capable of fighting a war to subdue Indonesia, which is the truth."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Heijningen still said: The Dutch government is confident of advancing into Yogyakarta (the capital of the Republic of Indonesia) within two weeks, but the Dutch government is reluctant to do so, because "even if we advance into Yogyakarta, the problem cannot be solved as a result." He told the reporter in detail about the past collusion between the Indonesian Republic and the Japanese fascists, and the secret relationship with Soviet Russia today. Mr. Heijningen also followed the unified propaganda policy of the Dutch government, dividing the former Dutch East Indies into three parts, namely: The Republic of Indonesia, including Sumatra and Java. Borneo. Celebes and the Federation of Small Islands in Eastern Indonesia. He said: The current disturbances in Sumatra and Java are only the barbaric behavior of the Republic of Indonesia, and have nothing to do with Borneo and the small islands in eastern Indonesia, "because the political views of the latter two are completely in line with the Dutch government." This kind of proposition is: the three separate parts jointly organize the "United States of Indonesia." This United States of Indonesia has diplomatic and national defense powers, and has an independent and autonomous government. The reporter asked: What will be the relationship between this ideal United States and the Netherlands itself in the future? Mr. Heijningen said that the Dutch government currently has no plan, but he firmly believes that it may be like Canada's relationship with Britain.</p>
<p>The reporter of this newspaper arrived in The Hague from Paris on Christmas Eve. At that time, Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Beel and the Minister of Colonial Affairs and the Minister of Labor flew to the East Indies together. The Dutch government and public all believe that if the Indonesian dispute is not resolved one day, the economic situation in the Netherlands will not improve one day. At present, in addition to the almost complete suspension of trade between the East Indies and the Netherlands itself, according to non-official estimates, the Dutch government spends 3.5 million guilders (Dutch currency) a day on the state of war in Indonesia. The Dutch are very envious of Belgium owning the vast African Congo, which is peaceful and without incident. The two sister countries of Belgium and the Netherlands, after being washed by this war, have a disparity in wealth that is definitely unimaginable before the war.</p>
<p>However, the spokesman of the Dutch Colonial Department is unwilling to talk deeply about the Dutch government's difficult situation caused by the Indonesian issue. Mr. Heijningen pointed to the maps hanging all over the walls, saying that the Dutch government officials' trip to Indonesia was purely to promote a satisfactory solution to the Indonesian issue before April next year (ie this year), because in April next year, the Netherlands will amend the Party Law, especially amending the article on territory in the current constitution, deleting the so-called directly-administered territories, including Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes and other words. "If the political structure of the East Indies is not stabilized one day, the amendment of the constitution will still be difficult." The opinions of a part of the non-official people in The Hague believe that Prime Minister Beel may adopt a tougher policy towards Indonesia after returning from this trip. Another group of Dutch intellectuals believes that as long as the Netherlands and Indonesia sign a more permanent economic mutual assistance treaty, so that Indonesia's abundant resources can help the Netherlands' economic hardship, then any other political disputes may be greatly conceded.</p>
<p>As for the official opinion of The Hague, it is between these two extremes. The reporter of this newspaper talked with Mr. Mulder, the director of the Press Department of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and his assistant Mr. Heer, about the attitude of the various political parties towards the Indonesian disturbances. Mr. Mulder, who was a reporter for "The New York Times" for many years, believes that the Dutch government's so-called Indonesian policy has been jointly decided by the two major parties in the past, namely the left wing of the Catholic Party and the right wing of the Labor Party. Because their position is moderate, their so-called policies are also prone to being passive and even showing hesitation. He believes that Prime Minister Beel will have changes after returning from his trip to the East. He told reporters: The Dutch Labor Party, that is, the incarnation of the Social Democratic Party, changed its name to the current name in order to meet the British Atlee's Labor Party. The left wing of the party advocates concessions to Indonesia. The Dutch Communist Party, which has ten seats in the parliament, advocates unconditional withdrawal from Indonesia, but the right wing of the Catholic Party (the largest party) firmly advocates maintaining the traditional colonial policy.</p>
<p>The reporter of this newspaper also visited Dr. Weitzhaus, the director of the Press Department of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Dr. Wei strongly stated that the Indonesian dispute must be resolved as soon as possible. However, he said: The current economic hardship in the Netherlands is not entirely caused by the Indonesian issue. A separate report will be made on the current economic situation in the Netherlands.

<p>Original Price: (Across the River) 1.500 yuan</p>
<p>(Long Distance) 1.000 yuan (per person nautical mile)</p>
<p>Director Zhao told reporters yesterday that the new prices after the above adjustments have not exceeded the old prices by one time, nor have they reached 80%. Among them, the subway and tram increased the most, by 70%, the municipal ferry increased by 66%, and the bus increased by 60%. The municipal authorities, in order to be considerate of the burden on citizens, do not want to increase them too much. If calculated according to the automatic adjustment formula approved by the Economic Council, the bus should increase by 83%, the tram should increase by 94%, and the ferry should increase by 117%.</p>
<h3>Government Agrees to Restore Industrial Loans</h3>
<p>However, the Detailed Rules for Lending Still Need to be Discussed in Detail</p>
<p>Industrial Association Sends Telegram to National Industrial Community Seeking Opinions</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wu Yuncho, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, went to Beijing a few days ago to report to the financial authorities the difficulties faced by factories since the government stopped industrial loans, and requested that they be restored quickly to support national industry. Wu returned to Shanghai with Governor Zhang of the National Bank yesterday. According to his statement to reporters, the government has agreed in principle to immediately open industrial loans, but the detailed rules for lending, such as how to ensure that the loans are actually used for production, still need to be discussed in detail. The Industrial Association has sent a telegram to the national industrial community seeking opinions, so as to gather and provide them to the government for reference. Wu said that the Industrial Association hopes that in the future, industrial trade associations can participate in the review work when loans are granted, because the trade associations will definitely be clearer about the situation in their industry than the government, and the trade associations can be responsible for supervision to prevent abuses from happening again.</p>
<h3>Russian Ship Runs Aground Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A Russian ship, the Podoesk, ran aground at a location 48 nautical miles outside the Wusong Estuary yesterday. The ship was on its way to Vladivostok to add coal in Shanghai, and it was not carrying passengers or cargo. After leaving Shanghai the morning before, it ran aground outside the Wusong Estuary. The ship immediately sent out a distress signal, which was intercepted by the US Navy signal station here, and it notified the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the Soviet Consulate sent another Soviet ship, the Smolny, and two tugboats to tow it. It is reported that the second cabin of the grounded Podoesk has been flooded, but there is no immediate danger of sinking.</p>
<h3>President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, Concerned About Dispute at the District Court</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the District Court added civil and criminal courts and promoted judges to serve as court presidents, causing dissatisfaction among the other 32 judges, who jointly submitted a signed report to Guo Yunguan, President of the High Court, and Cha Liangjian, President of the District Court, expressing their opinions. Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, has also paid close attention to this matter. After arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before, he immediately summoned Judge Xie Huai to inquire about the situation yesterday. Upon hearing the news, Cha Liangjian also rushed to President Ju's residence to report on the occurrence of the incident. At that time, Ju instructed Cha to handle it properly to avoid escalating the dispute. Also, yesterday morning, Feng Qun, the registrar of the High Court, summoned all the judges of the District Court on the order of President Guo Yunguan, and responded to the previous signed report, generally meaning that after the judges are promoted to court presidents, the original number of judges will be reduced, and there may be a backlog of cases. There is no need to worry about this point, because the judges who are promoted to court presidents will still handle cases, and the number of cases they handle will not be reduced as a result. As for the question of qualifications, whether it is appropriate for those who have served as judges for less than three years to be promoted to court presidents, the High Court has no right to interpret and will forward it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for verification.</p>

<h3>Pre-arranged Traps and Densely Woven Nets: Unscrupulous Merchants Like Moths to a Flame; Effective Plan of Setting Bait to Catch Birds; Gold and Foreign Currency Black Market Immediately Disappears</h3>
<p>Those Arrested Will be Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on Monday for Prosecution</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial management and economic inspection authorities used the clever plan of "setting bait to catch birds" and began to take action on the 9th to crack down on the gold and foreign currency black market, and have already achieved the expected results. This clever plan began to be arranged three months ago and was only recently completed. The gold and foreign currency black market began to rise sharply from the 7th, reaching its peak on the 8th. The authorities decided to implement this clever plan from the 9th and make a thunderous blow with lightning speed. On the evening of the 9th, six major gold and foreign currency black market organizations in this city were seized, and eight principal offenders were arrested. Action continued on the 10th to expand the effect, and the gold and foreign currency black market has disappeared. It is expected that this can be maintained for a considerable period of time. This shocking measure was carried out on the morning of the 9th by personnel from the Financial Administration Bureau together with the economic police of the Public Security Bureau. Traps had already been pre-arranged in certain locations, and densely woven nets were set up. When the action began, those engaged in gold and foreign currency speculation were like moths to a flame, falling into the net one by one. By the evening of the 9th, dozens of people had been arrested. In addition to those who were released on bail, eight principal offenders are currently detained in the Public Security Bureau Detention Center. Their names are: Shen Zhengyang, Liu Jixin, Wang Jiasen, Wu Youren, Zhang Yongnian, Zhuang Shanbing, Yuan Boqing, Wang Zisheng. According to the clues obtained, the six gold and foreign currency black market organizations in this city were seized one by one, namely: Futai Tobacco Store on North Chenjing Road, Sichuan Road, Shunda Tobacco Store on Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, No. 216 in the Securities Building, Daquan Store at No. 2, Ningbo Road, Bin County Tobacco Store at No. 206, Nanjing Road, No. 4 Yuan Shangli, Dong Zilaihuo Street, Jinling East Road. The total amount of gold and foreign currency seized on the 9th: More than 200 large bars of 10 taels of gold, More than 20,000 US dollars, 20,400 Northeast circulation notes, 1,002,251,000 yuan in legal currency, More than 24 billion yuan in checks. On the 10th, the economic police continued to launch an attack on the gold and foreign currency black market and pursued those who were definitely suspected of being involved in the black market based on the prior investigation. By the evening, more than 20 people, including Li Mingyue, Zhou Guiying, Chen Shihua, Li Wenhai, Huang Linxiang, and Shi Guangyou, had been arrested, and a number of black market organizations, such as Zhengyu Tobacco Company and Yufeng Company, had been broken up. The details are being sorted out. Ruan Guanglu, Director of the Administrative Department of the Public Security Bureau, who presided over this operation, told reporters on the afternoon of the 10th: The actions of the past two days have achieved the expected results in suppressing the gold and foreign currency black market. The main task now is to pursue the checks that have been seized. It is believed that the giants engaged in the gold and foreign currency black market will not be difficult to obtain. The criminals who have been arrested will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on the 12th for handling in accordance with the "Regulations on the Punishment of Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency."</p>
<h3>Financial Giant Li Lixia Discusses the Process of Uncovering the Black Market, Involving 100-200 People, Continuing the Chase</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Li Lixia, the Director of the Financial Management Bureau, met with reporters at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. to discuss the gold and currency case. According to him, the case involves as many as 100 to 200 people, and dozens have already been arrested. The pursuit is still ongoing, so a specific number cannot be given. Those arrested yesterday were either one side of the transaction or currency speculators. Today, the other side of the transaction is being pursued, or individuals are being arrested based on confessions. When implementing the arrests, the authorities relied on four clues: gold, U.S. dollars, checks, and legal tender. In addition to the daily investigation records of the Auditing Department of the Central Bank and the Financial Management Bureau, special attention was paid to the transaction behavior at the time. The arrests implemented yesterday were all at the transaction locations, making it impossible for them to deny.</p>
<p>20 Billion in Check Funds Confirmed to Be Frozen</p>
<p>As of today (the 10th), the evidence seized includes over 120 gold bars, over 15,000 U.S. dollars, approximately 1 billion in legal tender, and approximately 25 billion in checks. After working through the night, the Financial Bureau has confirmed that 20 billion yuan in check funds have been frozen. In addition to freezing and confiscating the check accounts, the courts will impose penalties according to the law. The largest transaction location broken up yesterday was at No. 10 Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road in this city, where over 90 gold bars were found. Currently, the arrests implemented are only a small portion of those engaged in this type of transaction. However, detailed investigation records are available for the majority of the others, and they will be arrested if they are found to have engaged in transactions in the future. Also, in this major case, the checks were indeed printed by the banks themselves, but it is not easy to determine whether the banks themselves were engaged in this type of black market transaction. It can only be said that some of their employees were involved. Foreign merchants engaged in currency speculation will be treated "equally" and handled fairly according to the law.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Suspicious Phone Calls Secretly Recorded</p>
<p>Mr. Li further pointed out that after the Auditing Department of the Central Bank began to take charge of investigating the black market for currency speculation, many independent agencies were established and mixed in with the locations of the black market currency speculation transactions in order to achieve the objective, so as to monitor their telephone and telegraph communications. After several months of effort, hundreds of suspicious phone calls have been recorded in detail, and any codes or secret languages have been translated by specialists. To cite an example, Yongshunli Company (No. 960 Zhongzheng East Road) in this case, which specialized in large-scale illegal remittances to Hong Kong, had four secret radio stations. On average, they sent and received 30 to 40 secret messages per day, which were secretly recorded by staff on a daily basis. After the case was broken, the secret messages seized were completely consistent with the daily investigation records of the Auditing Department, demonstrating the efficiency of the operation. Mr. Li also said that the gold bars, cash, and checks in this case have now been mostly sent to the Central Bank for safekeeping. The crackdown on the black market for currency speculation in Shanghai will likely result in no black market prices for a period of time. Given the large amount of gold and currency stored in this city, it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no small-scale transactions in the future, but every effort will be made to ensure that the price of gold and currency does not fluctuate greatly and affect others. The staff involved in the crackdown will be rewarded for their contributions. After the currency case is brought to a close, a report will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>The Storage and Transportation Department of the General Administration of Highways to Officially Commence Operations Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation has established the Shanghai Office of the Materials Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry of Transportation and the Shanghai Automobile Management Office to take over the Shanghai Highway Automobile Management Office of the General Administration of Highways, and has appointed Yu Lexing, the original person in charge of the Automobile Management Office, as its director. The office officially completed the handover procedures yesterday, and all 200 commercial vehicles, 50,000 gallons of gasoline, and property and equipment were inventoried. The office is scheduled to officially commence operations tomorrow. It is also heard that Mr. Yu is vigorously attempting to reduce the staff, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Transportation. To date, over 100 redundant personnel have been dismissed.</p>
<h3>Voting Procedures for the Election of Legislators - Different Methods for Occupational and Regional Elections, Strictly Enforced to Prevent Abuses</h3>
<p>The election of legislators is scheduled to be held from the 21st to the 23rd of this month, as reported in this newspaper. However, the election methods for legislators in this city have been slightly revised compared to the election of National Assembly delegates. To thoroughly understand the voting procedures, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Municipal Election Office, who provided the following detailed information: Regarding the acquisition of voting rights by voters, it is necessary to meet the essential conditions of being 20 years of age or older, residing in this city for more than six months, or having a domicile for more than one year, and being registered on the voter list. Voters participating in regional elections, in addition to meeting the above essential conditions, must also bring their National Identification Card and the legislator's voting certificate to be issued, and go to the designated polling station to vote. It is a common misconception that anyone who has obtained a National Identification Card has the right to vote, which is incorrect. Regional legislator voting certificates will be issued starting on the 12th of this month and ending on the 18th. According to the law, elections are a right of citizens, and all citizens with the right to vote should collect their voting certificates from their respective baojia (neighborhood administrative units), otherwise, they will be deemed to have automatically waived their right. However, in order to take into account the facts and encourage voters to vote enthusiastically, the Municipal Election Office has notified all districts and baojia to make every effort to deliver the certificates. However, the personnel of the baojia are limited and their duties are numerous, so if voters are not at home when the certificates are delivered, it will not be possible to make a second or third delivery. In such cases, the personnel of the baojia cannot be held responsible. Therefore, voters are urged to value their own rights and, if they have not received their legislator's voting certificate by mid-month, they should go to the office of the baojia to claim it. If the personnel of the baojia obstruct or withhold the certificates, the Municipal Election Office will severely punish them according to the law upon discovery. The main purpose of using both the National Identification Card and the voting certificate in the regional legislator elections in this city is to prevent impersonation. Voters must personally go to the polls to vote, and no cheating will be allowed. As for occupational elections, since the headquarters has ordered that it is not necessary to also use the National Identification Card, this city will continue to comply with the order. Soldiers residing in this city for more than six months are legally entitled to participate in regional voting in this city, but they must still obtain a household registration in this city, be registered as voters, and obtain both a National Identification Card and a voting certificate before being allowed to vote. As for officers and soldiers living inside military camps, according to the household registration law, they are not allowed to apply for a National Identification Card. The Election Office has notified all district offices to instruct them to affix photos to the voting certificates so that they can participate in voting. In order to accurately verify the number of ballots received, the number of ballots issued, and the number of remaining ballots in each polling station, the Municipal Election Office has stipulated that each polling station must immediately report a list to the district office on the day of the completion of voting. The district offices must, on the day after the completion of voting, report a list to the Municipal Election Office of the total number of ballots received, the total number of ballots issued, and the number of remaining ballots in the entire district, and submit the remaining ballots and the voter list sealed together. At the same time, the supervisors of the polling stations must report to the Election Office on the afternoon of the completion of voting for verification, in order to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>Former Instructor of the Puppet Aviation School Dies of Illness After Sentencing</h3>
<p>Li Zeci Assisted in Securing the Coffin</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wen Shisong, a traitorous prisoner at the High Court Detention Center, was a former instructor at the puppet aviation school. He was from Guangdong and was sentenced to three years in prison. Earlier, due to his fondness for women, he developed nephritis in prison. When he became seriously ill, the prison ordered him to post bail. However, Wen had no friends in Shanghai, and he was also ordered to pay cash bail. However, Wen was destitute and unable to post bail. Later, the prison sent him to Heji Hospital for treatment, where he died yesterday. Because he had no estate, there was no way to collect his body after his death. Li Ze, a fellow prisoner from Guangdong, contacted a funeral home on his behalf, and Li was responsible for the costs, so that the body could be collected.</p>
<h3>Red and Green, Durable and Beautiful - Xinjiang Hetian Carpets on Public Display Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Xinjiang Hetian Carpet Exhibition, sponsored by the Northwest Minsheng Industrial Company, is scheduled to be held from the 11th to the 13th at No. 9 Shaoxing Road for three days. A preview was held yesterday, and Pan Gongzhan, Tang Guanyu, Chen Guokang, Qian Xinzhi, Jin Run, and other celebrities from home and abroad attended the event and made purchases. The company has shipped 500 carpets to Shanghai for the exhibition, and more than half of them have already been purchased by various sectors.</p>
<p>Purely Handmade</p>
<p>Hetian, the carpet production area, is located southwest of the Xinjiang Taklamakan Desert and is a new and unique handicrafts center. In addition to carpets, the area's specialties also include mutton fat jade, leather suitcases, and mulberry paper, commonly known as the "Four Treasures of Hetian." The raw materials for making carpets are wool produced locally in Xinjiang. After washing, coloring, and weaving, because they are purely handmade, only about one foot can be woven in a week. A carpet one zhang (approximately 10 feet) long takes at least two months to make. The patterns and designs are bright red and green, fully blending the artistic colors of India, Persia, Greece, and Arabia. In addition, the quality is particularly durable. Europeans and Americans passing through Xinjiang all compete to buy them, so Hetian carpets have become one of Xinjiang's diplomatic gifts over the years.</p>
<p>Quality Still Needs to Be Thickened</p>
<p>The Chinese and foreign visitors who came to the exhibition and made purchases yesterday all agreed that the quality and colors of the carpets were good, but the sizes were insufficient and the quality still needed to be thickened. The Northwest Company is considering making improvements in the future. According to the company, Hetian is far from Shanghai. Normally, transportation can be arranged from Hetian to Dihua, then to Lanzhou, and then to Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) via Xi'an and the Longhai Line. Since the Longhai Railway was interrupted, it is only possible to detour through Chongqing, so the transportation distance is about 8,000 kilometers, and it takes three months to reach Shanghai from the western border. However, the company is working to streamline transportation, so that the exchange of goods between the border areas and the interior will be more ideal in the future.</p>
<h3>Gold Found in the Fire - Two Large Gold Bars - Original Owner Determined</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At 0:30 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out at No. 2, Lane 07, Ninghai East Road. A tenant, Mr. Chen, in a panic, failed to retrieve two large gold bars stored in his safe. He requested Zhu Zhifeng, the captain of the Songshan Squadron of the Fire Department, to rescue them on his behalf. When the fire was slightly subdued, Zhu accompanied Chen up the stairs on a ladder. When the safe was opened, only some scattered gold jewelry was found, but no gold bars. Later, Captain Zhu re-entered another room and found them in a wooden box. Because Chen's statement was inconsistent, and there may have been other reasons, they were taken back to the headquarters for filing. After investigation yesterday, Chen was allowed to bail them out.</p>

<h3>Re-Investigation of the Assassination Case of Chou Lianhuan, Ye Guangde</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the case of Chou Lianhuan being assassinated, Chou's widow, Chen, expressed dissatisfaction with the District Prosecutor's Office's decision not to prosecute the defendant, Ye Guangde, claiming that Ye was suspected of instigating others to murder Chou Lianhuan and requested a review. Yesterday, the High Prosecutor's Office ordered the District Prosecutor's Office to re-investigate. The District Prosecutor's Office's reason for not prosecuting Ye Guangde was that Ye was a friend of Chou Lianhuan, and that Chou Lianhuan did not mention Ye Guangde when he was dying, so there was insufficient evidence. However, Ye had remitted 1.8 million yuan for Chou to misappropriate, which caused him to harbor resentment. In addition, Ye had fled to Ningbo to stay temporarily after Chou was murdered, which made the situation suspicious. After receiving the order, the District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled to summon Chen, Huang Zhensheng, Wang Hengsun, Chen Youqin, Jiang Rongfa, Kong Rongsheng, Luo Zude, Shen Genfu, Gu Ajin, Zhang Guangxiang, and the sister of Mao Qingyu, Qi Fudeng, and others for questioning on the afternoon of the 13th of this month.</p>

<h3>Lament for Kowloon Walled City</h3>
<p>"Our newspaper's Guangzhou airmail report on the 8th" Writing about the so-called "incident" in Kowloon Walled City always brings to mind the heartbreaking scenes of national affairs 50 years ago. It's hard to say whether it's sadness or hatred. After eight years of arduous war, we shed all the shackles of imperialism and joined the ranks of the five powers. However, at the beginning of the new year, amidst the strong sounds and laughter of diplomatic gatherings and banquets, an allied nation that fought alongside us against the enemy actually took the form of an invading army, demolishing the houses built and inhabited by our compatriots in Kowloon for generations, and arresting compatriots who stood on our national territory. The word "friendship" has become a self-deceiving explanation. The negotiations and signatures and near-stoppage signify a feeling that is truly more tragic than can be expressed! At exactly 5:00 a.m. on the 5th of January, the Hong Kong side mobilized</p>
<p>fully armed police, wearing anti-riot masks, carrying riot shields, tear gas, and armored vehicles, as if facing a formidable enemy. They advanced menacingly straight to Kowloon Walled City. At a single order, iron hammers were raised and axes were swung, bricks and tiles and furniture flew around. Kowloon Walled City, a Chinese territory that stood neatly, was flattened within twelve hours, turning into a wasteland and complete desolation. The residents were unarmed, and their heavy hearts had already made them forget that this was still the territory of their motherland. The solemn national flag was torn to the ground, and the residents' own slogans of "Defending Territorial Sovereignty" were reduced to ashes along with the rubble.</p>
<p>Resident representatives Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu were also arrested and detained by the Hong Kong side for "resisting demolition." During the massive demolition, two young men uttered words of disapproval on the sidelines and were immediately put on prison cars by Hong Kong police, handcuffed, and sent back to the Hong Kong Police Station. The sound of collapsing houses, the cries of women and children, and the sighs on the roads were all mixed together, simply creating a scene as if a city had fallen! It is reported that a total of 74 houses were demolished this time, leaving 686 residents homeless, and the loss of property was valued at no less than 5.6 billion national currency, and the entire city was almost completely destroyed.</p>
<p>On the 7th, the Kwangtung and Kwangsi Diplomatic Commissioner's Office had already received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a</p>
<p>strong protest, declaring that the Hong Kong side should be fully responsible for all consequences arising from this matter. Mr. Guo also stated: "This is only the beginning of the incident." As for how it will "end," we must wait and see the wise decisions of our government. The matter has evolved to this point, the houses have been demolished, and more than 2,000 compatriots are being displaced. Who is responsible for our own responsibility is our own business, but the British side suddenly crossed the border to demolish houses and arrest people while the incident was still under negotiation and no results had been achieved. This responsibility naturally lies entirely with the British side. We hope that the diplomatic authorities will truly regard this as "the beginning of the incident."

<h3>Jiangsu Province Intensifies Grain Collection</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 8th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government stated that the central government's purchase of 1.2 million shi of provincial and county tax grain in this province for the 36th year of the Republic has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Recently, many counties have claimed financial difficulties or slow collection as reasons and have requested exemption from purchase or reduction of quotas. Although the reasons given are not without merit, the matter concerns a finalized plan, and military grain is urgently needed during this time of suppression of the rebellion. At this difficult time, it is imperative to abandon local selfish views and support national policies, so that the great plan of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation can be achieved as soon as possible. It recently issued a circular to all counties and cities stating that they must not request exemption or reduction of quotas for any reason in the future, so as not to change the finalized plan and affect military supplies, and must still mobilize all efforts to collect the full amount without delay.</p>

<h3>Auspicious Ganoderma Lucidum</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Deqing, 5th] On New Year's Day, Deqing poet Gao Lan and Lou Chang were touring the remote mountains in the western suburbs when they discovered a Ganoderma lucidum with a brown cap and purple stem on a stone wall at the burial site of the ancient Fangfeng clan. According to local gentry Xu Gongwu and others, it is indeed an auspicious Ganoderma lucidum. The specimen is large and mushroom-shaped, about five square inches in size, with a long, purple stem, a glossy and firm texture, a deep brown cap surface, and a light brown underside with small pores.</p>
<h3>New Year Scene in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 9th] The calamitous and difficult year of 1947 has quietly passed, ushering in the new appearance of 1948. Right at the start, we are about to encounter the Spring Festival (i.e., the Lunar New Year). This makes the new year, still in its infancy, feel incredibly bitter.</p>
<p>In this severe winter weather, thinking of the displaced victims of war, those living in this paradise of Hangzhou should be enjoying happiness. However, the war has brought fear, and opportunistic profiteers have raised all prices, making the Spring Festival bleak and frightening. Most poor people in Hangzhou find this "hurdle" difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices</p>
<p>In the market, cotton yarn, cloth, and flour are all rising in price. The government-allocated price of Wufu cloth is 1,375,000 yuan, and the market price has risen to 1,430,000 yuan. The price of cotton yarn has surged due to the sudden increase in the price of raw cotton. For example, Lingbao cotton is now priced at 7 million yuan, an increase of 1.6 million yuan. Therefore, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn is now 65 million yuan, an increase of 5.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the jewelry alley area of Qingtai Road, the black market for gold ornaments is rampant. According to reports on the 9th, the selling price reached 11.18 million yuan per tael, and the purchase price was 11.15 million yuan. The rise in rice prices is even more frightening. The listed price for Grade 1 rice is 1.05 million yuan, Grade 2 rice is 1.03 million yuan, and Grade 3 rice is 960,000 yuan, but there is no stock available. Transactions in the black market are as high as 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Easing of Credit</p>
<p>The main reason for this drastic fluctuation in prices is the excessive easing of credit, with too many loans being issued, causing idle funds to be used for hoarding. We hope that the Central Bank will tighten credit. Although this may lead to the bankruptcy of many speculators, it can force them to release their hoarded goods, suppressing these soaring prices and bringing much happiness to the majority of the people.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou market before the Spring Festival is not as prosperous as it was at this time last year. Every shop is open, but business is not necessarily good. However, they are holding onto good goods, which have already tripled in price. Moreover, due to the easing of credit, they still have surplus funds to purchase goods.</p>
<p>Suffering in the Agricultural Sector</p>
<p>However, the industrial, mining, and agricultural sectors appear to be in poor condition. The industrial and mining sectors find it easier to profit from hoarding raw materials due to rising costs, especially the issue of year-end bonuses, which is causing headaches for those in charge of industrial and mining enterprises. Farmers generally experienced prosperity after the autumn harvest because grain prices were very high at that time. However, rice prices have been steadily rising ever since, never going down, and have now reached nearly 2 million yuan as the Spring Festival approaches. Farmers have already sold their rice and now have to spend money to buy it back from the traders. As for the vegetables produced in the fields, intelligent speculators know that they cannot be hoarded. Moreover, because the weather is cool, people can buy more vegetables and eat them over several days. Therefore, amidst the soaring prices, the prices of agricultural products remain relatively stable. However, farmers who want to sell their vegetables and buy some daily necessities for the Spring Festival are greatly disappointed. Therefore, among the relatively depressed industrial, mining, and agricultural sectors, the agricultural sector is suffering the most.</p>
<p>Civil Servants</p>
<p>However, there are those who are even more miserable than farmers, and that is civil servants who live on salaries. They receive 700,000 to 800,000 yuan a month, and they have elderly and children to support. How can 700,000 to 800,000 yuan support their families today?</p>
<p>Last year's New Year scene in paradise was characterized by a sluggish commercial sector and a "collapse" of businesses. This year's New Year scene in paradise sees the commercial situation better than last year, but workers, miners, and civil servants are all weeping silently, wondering how to get through this Spring Festival.</p>
<p>Improvement in City Appearance</p>
<p>However, although paradise is so difficult, the appearance of the city seems to be much better than last year. Last year, under the eaves of shops along the lakeside, there were piles of miserable people everywhere. This year, they were seen in early winter but have since disappeared. Last year, on Yingshi Street, Yanling Road, and Hubin Road, some miserable girls were standing in the cold wind soliciting customers in dark corners. This year, these miserable girls are gone. Last year, the fortune tellers on Chenghuang Mountain, the boatmen on West Lake, and the monks in the temples all felt that they were struggling to make ends meet when reporters met them. This year, when reporters met them, they did not have this feeling. Because this year's incense offerings in Hangzhou are unprecedented in the past forty years, these people have had their difficulties solved by the donations of worshippers.</p>
<p>So where have the miserable beggars and girls of paradise gone? Have they found a way to make a living? Or has the government driven them to secluded streets in order to clean up the city's appearance? I have my doubts. (Special Correspondent: Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3>Body Found in Wuxi School Principal Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Wuxi, 7th] Xue Tailai, the principal of Chang'anqiao Central National School in the Fifth District of the county, was murdered by bandits last autumn. His family reported the case to various authorities, requesting that the perpetrators be apprehended. The county government ordered the nearby township governments to find the body within a specified period, but it was not found. The local council, education association, and others also recognized Xue's loyalty and dedication to education and initiated a fundraising campaign to comfort the bereaved family. Recently, the family received a strange letter stating: "Principal Xue was indeed a good man, and it is regrettable that he suffered such a tragedy. His body is now in the Chanyuan area on the border of Xizhen. Please send someone to collect and verify it." Upon learning this, Xue's family immediately reported it to the local security team the day before, who went to search and indeed found Xue's body. All the muscles in the body had been completely decayed, leaving only a skeleton. The head, neck, and hands were all tied with rope. After being identified as Xue, the body was collected and buried. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Xue's father and mother came to the city to meet with County Magistrate Xu, requesting revenge for their son. Secretary Zhou met with them on behalf of the magistrate. In addition to reporting the details of the case, Xue raised three requests: The County Security Team had previously captured the bandit Miao Changde, who is currently being interrogated at the command post. Please request the command post to immediately sentence him to death. Apprehend the remaining fugitives. Provide generous compensation to the bereaved family. Secretary Zhou agreed to comply, and Xue's father thanked him and left.</p>

<p>Original Plan (5) The Changpingcang system urgently needs to be established. Important locations in the Yangtze River Basin must complete the initial warehouse construction and storage plan as soon as possible. Local grain storage should also be strengthened, promoted and universally implemented to increase reserves.</p>
<p>Establishment of Changpingcang</p>
<p>1. Based on national defense and economic perspectives, select the areas in the Yangtze River Basin and Tianjin with grain shortages and grain producing areas, based on grain production and sales, and transportation costs, and set them up in stages.</p>
<p>2. Fundraising method:</p>
<p>1. Adopt the principle of unified warehouse administration and division of labor. Changpingcang and agricultural warehouses are integrated into a unified system to connect and cooperate with each other.</p>

<p>4. The business policy is to maintain production, regulate surpluses, and stabilize prices. The policy is described as follows:</p>

Appropriate and fair standard prices should be set separately.</p>
<p>Two. Transportation: Changpingcang does not provide transportation tools and completely adopts the consignment system. However, insurance must be provided based on the value to avoid losses along the way. Transportation agencies should give priority to the supply of transportation tools as military transport as much as possible, or negotiate for transportation on their behalf.</p>
<p>Three. Sales: When grain prices in the sales area are high, Changpingcang should immediately sell the purchased and stored grain to regulate the grain. The allocation work should be handled by the local competent grain administration agency.</p>
<p>Promotion of local grain storage</p>
<p>1. Clear grain storage: The quantity of grain stored in each province and city in the past and the distribution of warehouses shall be cleared by the grain department of each province and city within a limited time, and the list shall be submitted.</p>
<p>2. Fundraising method: In the next two years, 70% of the fundraising will still be based on the amount of land income, and 30% will be based on business tax, house tax, and other property interest, and will be collected on a progressive basis. The starting point for fundraising should also be determined based on the actual situation, and small households should be exempt from fundraising. After the investigation of rental income and income is completed, the fundraising standard will be re-formulated.</p>
<p>3. Construction of warehouses: In the next two years, the construction of new warehouses will be limited to the construction of county and city grain storage warehouses. The repair of existing warehouses or the conversion of public houses and temples will be the main focus for township grain storage warehouses. New warehouses will be built after each township has harvested more than 50 million stones. County and city warehouses must be located in places with convenient water and land transportation. Township warehouses should be located in the townships where government offices are located. All new warehouses and repairs to existing warehouses must be handled according to the reasonable construction design drawings issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Food to prevent rodent damage, insect damage, and mold smoke damage.</p>
<p>4. Scope of use: The scope of use of stored grain shall be handled in accordance with the following regulations:</p>

<p>Two. Leveling: The county and city grain storage management committee shall submit the report to the county and city government and forward it to the provincial government for approval, and return the grain to the warehouse after the new grain is harvested.</p>
<p>Three. Relief: The county and city government, together with relevant agencies, shall report to the provincial government and request the Ministry of Food to verify and handle the evidence.</p>
<p>Four. The county and city government shall formulate a plan for the construction of warehouses and submit it to the provincial government for approval and transfer to the Ministry of Food for approval.</p>

The fans were excited for a while, with more than 6,000 people in attendance, which was quite lively. Unfortunately, the performance of the entire Tung Wah team yesterday was not ideal.

<p>Changing the formation and fighting again, Tung Wah's original formation remained unchanged. Tede Chen Yazhu retired, and Liu Lusheng took office. Tung Wah's five forwards were fierce, and Xu Fusheng saved the day again and again. Tung Wah looked at the door and sighed. Not long after, Xu Erz kissed the ball with his hand. Sun Jinshun took the penalty kick, and Xu Fusheng once again made a meritorious service. In the 16th minute, Tung Wah Tan Fuzhen fouled in the penalty area. Liu Longsheng took the penalty kick and kicked the door open. Tede took the lead 2-1. The entire Tung Wah team counterattacked.

After the integration, the Central Bank's business will develop more steadily. The issue of restoring loans from national banks is still awaiting detailed study at the quarterly meeting of the Four Banks Joint Office this Thursday before there are any clues. The rumors that the current regulations on the entry and exit of combatants and the organization of the Foreign Exchange Balance Committee will be changed are completely untrue.

The remittance form only needs to fill in the remittance location, recipient, quantity, and purpose columns. Various banks and companies have followed the report form separately. The bureau will conduct a general survey once a week and will conduct a special new investigation on the current situation of various banks and companies. The time of establishment of various banks and companies, the names of the responsible persons, the amount of capital, and the type of business must be investigated in detail. The investigation form was issued on the 9th and various banks and companies are required to fill it out within a week. According to the person in charge of the bureau, this investigation is to facilitate the implementation of the general survey work, that is, the preparation for the general survey work. After mid-month, the review will begin, so that the private funds of banks and companies can be transferred to production purposes. The purpose is to stop speculation, guide funds into the right track, support legitimate businesses, and actively increase production.</p>
<h3>Major Players Desire to Capture and Release, Chinese Stocks Tend to Fluctuate</h3>

Yongsha was the first to see rising winds, but it was difficult to maintain until the closing. Various small stocks and miscellaneous stocks also gradually stabilized their positions, and the trend was mostly composed of a rotating pattern.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the rumor of Stalin's death shook people's hearts, causing the already weak situation to appear even more fragile. The opening was low, and Sino-French stocks continued to fall to the limit. Yongsha debuted at 740 yuan and 741 yuan, and after the opening, it was forced down to low prices of 718 yuan and 727 yuan. There were many supply sales of No. 137. Because the trading desk saw that major players were aggressively selling off-market the previous day, they were not optimistic about the strength of No. 137 at this time. They hoped to initiate small transactions immediately. It was generally believed that the major players intended to offset off-market, so people's hearts were better. Soon, off-market quotations were indeed high, and some people also bought in the market, so they rose to 738 yuan and 756 yuan. Interest prices opened high to 2.4 and 2.85 jiao, then retreated to 720 yuan and 730 yuan. Nos. 207, 65, 73, 155, 30, and 23 bought and delivered successively, while No. 152 and others delivered immediately after entering.

<h3>Silk All Show Weakness</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market continued to decline yesterday. In the morning, No. 120 Xuzi Yuguang opened a price of 10 million yuan for the first week.

The first week was 2 million yuan, and in the afternoon, it slightly improved, once reaching 7.8 million yuan, but it fell again to 5 million yuan.

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Selling Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was low at the opening yesterday. Customers were shifting away, and local merchants' intentions were also weak. Favorable news spread in the market, and many floating shares were cashed in. 42-count Jinfeng yarn was once as low as 60.5 million yuan. Near the closing, local replica manufacturers saw a small increase and returned to 61.5 million yuan, down 2.9 million yuan from the previous day. In addition, various counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined, ranging from 800,000 to 1.23 million.</p>
<p>Due to the decline in gold and banknote black markets, tighter silver roots, and the authorities' thorough investigation of households, the financial pressure was severe, and people's hearts were empty in the cotton cloth market. Similar products were sold endlessly, and many floating shares competed to escape. The supply and sales period for spinning construction arrived, and the chips were abundant, so the market conditions gradually deteriorated. As a result, 12-pound tou and other grades of silk cloth continued to fall by 5670,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the trend was that Shilin cloth and colored cloth factories were generally high, and the selling price was uniquely brisk. The markets for other bleached cloth, twill serge, and trade record cloth were all sluggish. Also, it was reported that the Spinning Construction Company supplied and sold trumpet children's fine cloth, with a listed price of 1.31 million yuan, Jinlian Miaowu Yuanbi 1.48 million yuan, and Four Gentlemen Zhigong 1.58 million yuan.

<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was active due to the expansion of factory absorption, and the industry traded with each other. The Spinning and Weaving Corporation's registration for purchasing flower clothing also began at the same time, and the opening price was also higher than generally expected, so people's hearts were firm, and 1,150 bales were traded.

<h3>Customers and Goods Compete to Sell, People's Hearts Tend to be Empty, and Rice Prices Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Rice Stores Must Mark Selling Prices or Be Punished</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] Due to the authorities' large supply of silk in the market, people's hearts are softening, and the rice market is sluggish. Customers and goods compete to sell, and rice prices fall across the board. A total of 23,944 shi of goods were registered in the market. The Market Management Committee supplied 9,000 shi each in the North and South markets, a total of 18,000 shi, an increase of 3,000 shi from the previous day, and it was still distributed at a price of 1.35 million yuan. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, said yesterday that the authorities' policy of supplying rice in the market will continue until the rice price stabilizes. Director Wu affirmed that the rice price will fall back and will definitely be lower than 1.35 million next week.</p>
<p>According to Director Wu's analysis of the reasons for the rise in rice prices, the average daily arrival of rice in the city in January was more than 15,000 shi, which is sufficient to declare that the source is not exhausted. If it is certain that merchants are to blame, then the high prices in the producing areas are also the truth, so the main reason is still the issuance of large banknotes. The large batch of rice purchased by Shanghai grain merchants was previously detained in Nanjing, and after investigation, it was released and is on its way to Shanghai. The aforementioned municipal food will not form a problem of availability. At present, the authorities supply rice in large quantities in the market at a price of 1.35 million per day. After adding profit and transportation costs, the retail price should not exceed 1.5 million, otherwise it will be a windfall profit, and social avoidance will be given to the ban. Director Wu also said: The Social Bureau previously ordered each retail rice store to mark the price in real terms, but this has been the case for a long time, and most rice stores no longer do it. During this period of rice price fluctuations, in order to avoid unscrupulous merchants from auctioning prices, the rice stores have been ordered by the industry association to instruct the rice stores to restore the pricing method, and must mark the rice and the price per stone on the rice, otherwise they will be punished regardless of whether they exceed the limit price or not.</p>
<h3>Mixed Grains Rose and Fell Intermittently, Oil Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 14,600 shi of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets, and the supply of rice and grain increased. A total of 17,545 shi were sold in the North and South markets. The supply and demand were appropriate, and the market conditions stabilized. The price of Xian rice softened in the middle and second roads, but Baiyuan Yinyuan rose by 340,000 yuan due to the strong winter sales hall.</p>
<p>Flour was oversupplied and undersold, and the rise stopped and the fall started, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Bean skin sales were also sluggish, losing 78,000 yuan. There were few soybean cake payers, and many wanted to get rid of it, cutting 20,000 yuan sharply. Huangdou Kebang and Hua were about to move, and the street heard of dispersal. The oil factory reduced the price of finished products, and the intention was to. Early set noon tired, closing voice soft. Black-eyed peas had weak transactions in both the North and South Oceans, forming a sluggish rise. Black-eyed peas were adopted in the North Ocean, soaring, rising by 340,000 yuan. Lentils were another aroma, and the steps were built up by 340,000 yuan. Under the fierce purchase of red beans in South China, they galloped by 450,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum was lightly traded and had few gentlemen, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Corn in the north, first, then cake. Raw peanuts turned and fell sharply by more than 100,000 yuan. Sesame digestion was light, falling back by 350,000 yuan. Xunma was also lacking in spirit.</p>

<p>Original Plan (6) The Farmers Bank of China should actively promote the agricultural warehouse storage, agricultural product mortgage, and agricultural product marketing business, so as to use financial power to assist the government, support production, and control the source of food, so as to prepare for emergencies.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures. A. Regarding the agricultural product marketing loan business: In order to cooperate with the current agricultural loan policy, marketing loans should select large-volume products related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, guide civilian organizations, and provide loans to assist their marketing business. The government encourages and guides farmers to organize their own processing and marketing institutions, and the Farmers Bank of China provides loans to assist their operations. Improve inspection and grading, improve the quality of agricultural products, so as to meet the needs of manufacturers and restore market reputation. The inspection of rice and wheat should be carried out only by Mang (hosted by the Agricultural and Forestry Department). The government formulates methods for protecting and encouraging the marketing of agricultural products, and provides convenience in transportation and reduces or exempts taxes. B. Regarding the agricultural product storage mortgage loan awards: In order to regulate the agricultural product surplus and stabilize agricultural product prices, the Farmers Bank of China selects appropriate locations in the agricultural product distribution areas of each province to actively set up agricultural warehouses at all levels to carry out storage mortgage loan business. For the types of warehouses, agricultural warehouses are set up in conjunction with Changping warehouses. (1) Simple agricultural warehouses - guided by the Farmers Bank of China for farmers' groups to set up on their own, and provide loans to assist them. (2) Agricultural warehouses - set up by the Farmers Bank of China in convenient locations for agricultural production and transportation to handle storage mortgage storage transfer business</p>
<p>Original Plan (7) Widely set up nurseries, promote afforestation, and effective methods must be used to maintain their growth. The natural forest security forest should be owned and operated by the state, and other suitable wasteland and barren land should be supervised by private enterprises, and attention should be paid to the operation and encouragement of fuel wood forests.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: Supervise the provinces, cities, and counties to increase the area of nurseries, set up cup yards, and implement afforestation in accordance with the method of strengthening afforestation. Divide the national civil forest supervision area, imitate the US Forest Service Commissioner system, supervise people's afforestation and handle forestry loans, technical guidance, and assist people in leading afforestation. Enrich the management office of state-owned forest areas, and legally delineate state-owned forest areas in important natural forest areas across the country to implement forest resource protection and utilization. Actively develop soil and water conservation in the three major river basins of the country, and sand prevention on the coast of the Yellow River Flood Area in the Northwest and border fortress national defense security forests, so as to protect the territory and improve the natural environment. Conscientiously follow the Chairman's instructions and instructions to handle the greening of the capital and national scenic spots, scenic forests, roadside trees, and the development of park forests. Quickly conduct a survey and survey of suitable afforestation areas across the country, and engage in demonstration operations of water source forests and special economic forests. For other suitable wasteland and barren land, focus on military industrial afforestation and encourage private enterprises, focusing on agricultural tool timber and fuel wood forests. All large-scale nursery and forest farms should set up forest police in accordance with the forest police rules to strengthen management and protection matters. Issue an order to all cities and counties to organize forest protection associations, cultivate people's habits of protecting forests, strictly prohibit burning mountains and indiscriminate logging, and divide firewood collection areas and close mountains to cultivate forests, and earnestly handle forest protection.</p>
<p>Original Plan (8) Use agricultural slack to train farmers in civil engineering and stone work skills, and develop rural side businesses to improve farmers' lives.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: Supervise local agricultural authorities and other engineering-related authorities to use agricultural slack to train farmers to build farmland water conservancy and repair roads and build houses, and civil engineering and stone work skills such as manufacturing agricultural tools, so as to build new rural areas on their own. Advocate and assist farmers in setting up or improving agricultural product processing and other various side businesses to increase farmers' income and enrich the agricultural promotion institutes in each county and the agricultural associations in various places, so as to become the main driving force for the universal training of farmers and the advocacy of side businesses.</p>
<p>Original Plan (9) For the livestock industry, attention should be paid to the prevention and control of animal diseases, the improvement of livestock quality, the increase of livestock types, and the encouragement of increased livestock production. Feed crops should be increased in agricultural areas, and wasteland should be used to expand livestock breeding. In natural nomadic areas, the development of livestock breeding should still be the main focus, and the management of pastoral areas should be strengthened, grasslands should be cultivated, and improved feed should be planted in order to stabilize and improve livestock production and improve the livelihood of herdsmen.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures. A. Prevention and control of animal diseases: Supervise the provinces to "prevent epidemics" rather than "cure epidemics" and pay attention to the combined implementation of political epidemic prevention and technical epidemic prevention. Mass production of serum vaccines for routine epidemic prevention and emergency epidemic treatment. Train epidemic prevention personnel to enrich epidemic prevention equipment, and set up epidemic prevention information networks to improve the epidemic prevention organization. Divide the country into ten major epidemic prevention areas, each with a veterinary epidemic prevention office to assist in the universal promotion of epidemic prevention work in various places. In addition to the seven epidemic prevention offices that have been established in the Northwest, Qinghai, Southwest, Huaxi, Southeast, North China, and Jin Sui, the Northeast epidemic prevention office should be formally established in 77 years, and a new epidemic prevention office should be planned, and finally a Tibet epidemic prevention office should be established. B. Change the quality of livestock, strengthen the improvement of breeding livestock. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has set up two cattle farms, one livestock farm, five sheep breeding farms, and four pig breeding farms in Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guizhou, Gansu, Sui, and Ning provinces to engage in breeding and promote profits. Universally set up good seed breeding stations to facilitate the improvement of civil livestock (each livestock farm has set up breeding stations and has been breeding with civil livestock).</p>

<h3>Completion of the Luo Hui Canal</h3>
<p>—Photographed by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Central Shaanxi Province, formerly known as Guanzhong, Shangshu "Its soil is yellow and bad, its fields are the best" is extremely beneficial to agriculture, but the land is highly high, and rain is rare. Every time there is a disaster, people are displaced and die of hunger. Those who cannot be counted will revitalize water conservancy, and write a fundamental plan for famine relief. The Luo Hui Canal is one of the eight Hui water conservancy plans ordered by the Chinese water conservancy pioneer Mr. Yishe. It draws the Luo River to irrigate the plains south of Dali and Chaoyi counties, with an area of 1,335 square miles, which can irrigate 500,000 mu of land. The scale of the project is the crown of the eight Hui. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Shaanxi Provincial Government set up the Yinluo Engineering Office and began surveying. The design was completed in the 23rd year. Due to the huge engineering cost, which could not be borne by local financial resources, it was approved by the central government to set up the Jingluo Engineering Bureau, which was established in May and actively carried out according to the plan. By June of the 26th year, the Nazang was counted as 521 kilometers, and the total length of the main canals was 80 kilometers. Major buildings such as dams, canal gates, aqueducts, culverts, bridges, and the first, second, third, and fourth tunnels have been completed successively.</p>
<p>The fifth tunnel, which passes through the Tielian Mountain, encountered gushing springs and quicksand, making progress extremely difficult. Between the 27th and 34th years, various methods were tried, but due to the wartime, the material and financial resources were insufficient, and the effect was minimal. By September of the 30th year, the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan was established, and Chinese and foreign experts were selected to go to the project area to jointly discuss and improve the methods. In September of the following year, Chairman Jiang ordered that the project be completed within a time limit, and the Water Conservancy Commission sent senior technicians to the project to supervise. After all kinds of hardships, manpower finally overcame the difficulties, and the entire tunnel was penetrated on November 26 of the 35th year. Together with the old tunnel in the north section, it is 3,377 meters long. It was officially waterproofed on December 12. The canal is more than 30 kilometers long. The surveying and excavation took 15 years, and the total engineering cost as of the end of September of this year, according to the annual price index of Shaanxi Province, converted into pre-war French currency, totaled 3015,093 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the approved irrigation plan, after the Water Conservancy Bureau urges the people to dig the bucket canal, the annual increase in wheat production can be 100,000 market loads, bean valley miscellaneous grains 75,000 market stones, and cotton 7.5 million market stones. The entire land itself can be increased in value by 225 billion yuan.</p>
<p>There are five culverts of the main canal to drain the slope water on the left side of the canal, this is one of them.</p>
<p>The terrain is measured from the diversion gate to the three main canals in the middle, east, and west. The canal slope is from 15/10,000 to 25/10,000, depending on the slope of the terrain. The purpose is to ensure that no water is wasted, the fields can be universally irrigated, and a considerable flow rate is maintained to avoid the disadvantages of erosion or siltation. The picture shows the canal water flowing down after the water is released.</p>
<p>The main canal of the Luo Hui Canal starts from the Shishi Waterfall of the Luo River in Laozhen Village, Chengcheng County, Shaanxi Province, and a rolling dam is built to draw the canal. The dam is 16.20 meters high and the dam top is 177.00 meters long. The dam surface is of the渥奇 type, and the dam axis is arc-shaped. The total dam volume is 20.525 cubic meters. Construction started in March of the 23rd year, and the entire dam was successful in January of the 24th year.</p>
<p>The diversion gate is located at the main canal in Yijing Village, east of the village, where it is divided into three main canals in the middle, east, and west. Each gate has one hole, which is 2.6 meters wide and 2.3 meters high. It is opened and closed by a winch.</p>
<p>There are two large aqueducts on the main canal, one in the Quli River, which is 116 meters long, the slot is 3.31 meters wide, the section is 6.72 square meters, the slope is one thousandth, and the slot water is 2 meters deep.</p>
<p>The canal gate and the flood discharge gate, the distance between the two gates is 250 meters from the inlet, which is the control mechanism of the entire canal. The canal gate has two holes, and the flood discharge gate is on the right side of the canal gate, forming a 90-degree right angle, with three holes. During the flood season, the muddy water entering the canal is discharged into the river from here, and the opening and closing of the gates are controlled by a winch.</p>
<p>There are five holes in the main canal, and the fifth hole is the most difficult to construct. It is 3,377 meters long and 3 meters wide, with a slope of one thousandth. In October of the 22nd year, engineer Zhang Pingzhi died in the fall under the high cliff of the No. 5 hole when he went to measure upstream, so it was named "Pingzhi Hole" to commemorate him.</p>

<h3>On Peepshows</h3>
<p>— Jie Ding</p>
<p>When I was young, peepshows had their own world. As long as a "peepshow" arrived in the streets and alleys, people would immediately rush to occupy the viewing holes (I don't know what they should be called). The operator would constantly change the animated pictures, chanting descriptive words for each picture. The viewer would squint one eye and look into the peepshow box with the other. Through the action of the lenses and the box, ordinary pictures became extraordinary. Magnified, they emitted an illusory light, seeming much more animated. Amidst the cries of the peepshow "sellers," such as "forest of fair legs," "spectacle of bombings," and "hand-to-hand combat," the viewing became even more enjoyable. The peepshow became a precious treasure for those in the countryside who had never seen a movie.</p>
<p>There was also another advantage to watching peepshows. The viewers all lowered their heads, one eye aligned with the viewing hole, their faces hidden in front of the box, and their bodies hunched over. Others couldn't see the expressions on the viewers' faces, much less the pictures inside the box. Therefore, whether the viewer was happy, ashamed, sneering, amazed, or laughing and scolding, it was all up to them. Others would just assume that you had seen something "moving" enough to elicit such reactions, and wouldn't ridicule your ignorance or being surprised by little things, nor would they guess what you were actually seeing. Even if people hurled a few curses, they would only blame themselves for not seeing the world inside the peepshow box, and would be deemed shallow.</p>
<p>However, as soon as the peepshow was taken apart, all the wonderful scenes disappeared, leaving only a few ordinary, commonly seen, gaudy pictures. This would not only disappoint the viewers, but also cause them to be scolded as worthless, which would be a great letdown.</p>
<p>Originally, the peepshow relied solely on the small lenses, box, and viewing hole. First, the pictures were enclosed in a dark little box, and then viewed through the "viewpoint" hole, becoming vivid "scenes." Therefore, the peepshow sellers could only shout loudly: "Without viewing through my lens, there is no magic." At the same time, they paid attention to controlling the lens: concave lenses, convex lenses, refracting glass, triangular prisms, and the addition of concave-convex reflecting mirrors on the sides. They also painted the lenses with red, yellow, blue, and white colors. Through refraction, light separation, total reflection, and other effects, the scenes finally came to life. As for the pictures being viewed, they could be picked up anywhere; as long as they passed through the lens, it didn't matter what they were.</p>
<p>It seems that movies are more "public," but they also go through several "lens filters," as well as makeup, directing, and editing. The reality obtained is actually limited, and the peepshow has been eliminated.</p>
<p>However, I prefer simple natural scenery or crude song and dance dramas, because the dazzling variety of peepshows and the like can only make people's eyes blur.</p>
<h3>Perseverance</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>After Holcomb's watch was stolen by a pickpocket, he asked people everywhere, "What time is it now?" After asking for more than two years and catching sight of thousands of watches, he finally caught the pickpocket. Holcomb is from Memphis, USA.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Lees of Hollywood had her first child, she desperately tried to get her child on the screen, but she failed. Her children came one after another, but Mrs. Lees' ambition remained unchanged. When her eighth child, Ni, grew up to be twelve years old, he finally jumped onto the screen.</p>
<p>Recently, the owner of a plumbing store in Oklahoma, USA, received 356 silver coins, each worth fifty cents, when collecting a debt. It turned out that the customer had called the plumbing store to repair his bathtub. According to the customer himself, every time he took a bath, he would drop a fifty-cent silver coin into a small container next to the bathtub, accumulating it little by little and using it to repair the bathtub, which was an excessive amount.</p>

<h3>Talking About Sleeves</h3>
<p>— Ren Weiyin</p>
<p>When the weather is cold, sleeves show their special function. A long robe with warm sleeves, both hands tucked inside, is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Speaking of sleeves, it's a long story. Since childhood, they have been used to wipe noses and tears, in both China and the West. It is said that the buttons on the cuffs of Western suits were originally sewn on the surface to prevent wiping noses with the sleeves. Later, the bad habit was changed, and the buttons were moved to the lower part of the cuffs, becoming decorations. Even a small object has its evolutionary history. And the function of sleeves is not limited to this: Traveling to Sichuan, I saw in a small town that the villagers all covered their hands when they met, which was deeply confusing. Why was the European style so thoroughly implemented! Later, I learned that it was a business custom, not to speak but to use fingers as numbers, "discussing prices in the sleeves." I couldn't help but suddenly realize that the function of sleeves was even more admirable. As for the ancient saying "sweating like rain, spreading sleeves forming shade," it was probably not boasting. The Taoist "universe in the sleeves," although mysterious, is like the ping-pong ball-sized atomic bomb that can destroy Hiroshima. With a wave of a large sleeve, how could Sun Wukong, who made a scene in the Heavenly Palace, not be captured!</p>
<p>Those who appreciate elegance like to talk about "red sleeves adding fragrance," but "thin emerald sleeves in the cold weather" inevitably bring shivers, losing that fresh flavor. Sleeves also have expressions. In opera, a shake of the sleeve can win a huge round of applause. When friends fall out, they "fling their sleeves and leave." The weapon hidden in the sleeve is called a "sleeve blade." If they disagree, our heroes would shout "swoosh!" and release a "sleeve arrow," sealing the throat with blood, guaranteeing a visit to the King of Hell in no time.</p>
<p>The use of sleeves is both wonderful and broad. No wonder elegant people all want to "dance well with long sleeves," seeking the art of sleeves. Since sleeves can be used to negotiate prices, hide mechanisms, flip buckets, and lift monkeys, what can't be done in this world? No wonder gentle breezes blow, sleeves dance, money pollutes the fields, starving people fill the roads, and even the country is shaken and the nation is in danger.</p>
<p>As for the pedantic scholars in the village, the poor talents, inevitably experiencing a cold pillow and clean sleeves, it is all because they have sleeves but do not know how to dance well. Su Dongpo's "don't lightly value the sowing of seeds with sleeves" is just self-mockery. Yuan Haowen's "now the world is watched with sleeves folded" is A Q spirit. Everything is born with its purpose. Oh sleeves, those who use them well will soar to success and become rich, those who do not use them well will only wipe their noses and tears. With sighs, I call out "Amen" three times, wishing that those in the world who do not understand the philosophy of sleeves deeply will promptly awaken!</p>
<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<p>— Ti Zhai</p>
<p>In the December issue of the Chinese Education Circle, there is an article by Mr. Dong Weichuan, discussing the uselessness of diplomas. It uses a dialogue format to tell two stories of people who became college presidents without obtaining university diplomas, which makes me feel a lot of emotion. I remember that after graduating from university, I didn't want to receive that piece of paper at all. Unemployment couldn't turn it into a meal ticket, working couldn't turn it into a guarantee, and finding a job couldn't turn it into a matchmaker. What was it for? However, the school at that time hoarded the diplomas, partly because they had a headache about the difficulty of storing them, and partly because they couldn't easily distribute them, because the tuition fees owed for four years were all relied upon on this piece of paper as collateral, like a ransom ticket. Knowing that it wasn't worth much money, they still couldn't break the rules.</p>
<p>I finally had to go and collect this glorious piece of paper that "entitles me to a Bachelor of Arts," because I had to teach "civics." Civics cannot be taught privately, but must be inspected, province-level, central-level, presented layer by layer as if narrating qualifications, and a diploma is required. I had no choice but to spend twenty-six yuan (for a supplementary fee) to take it out from the bottom of the registration office's box, three years and six months after graduation. When I received it, Registrar Mr. Kong lectured me in a voice like a broken gong: "Why didn't you collect it earlier? Why are you causing trouble now!" I stuck out my tongue: "Sorry, if I wasn't in a hurry, I would have asked you to keep it for a few more years." Thanks to this collection, when the July 7th Incident occurred, just these kinds of unclaimed certificates filled several large boxes, and followed the maps and instruments through thousands of mountains and rivers to escape to the interior. Maybe some were lost.</p>
<p>The certificate was only used this once—but I think the less it's used, the better, at least indicating that your profession is stable, and you don't have to be like the curfew in the concession in the past, checking your citizen's card back and forth. But recently it seems to have changed a bit. To be a middle school teacher requires inspection, and elementary school requires even more inspection, which means that you have to present the facts at any time. One day, maybe you have to carry it with you like a passport, in case of questioning. Then, I hope to reprint the certificate as big as a monthly tram ticket, so that it doesn't take up too much space in my pocket.</p>
<p>I have many classmates, all nicknamed "Half Year," such as "Zhang Half Year," "Pi Half Year," and so on. Why? Because when they teach, they must make a conclusion in half a year, either being driven away by the students or being dismissed by the authorities, hence this name. These rice buckets often put "BA from XX University" on their business cards. If it is a national university, they have to hang this golden signboard even more grandly. Thinking about it carefully, is the Bachelor of Arts and so on specially set up for this kind of people? Are diplomas also specially issued for this kind of people? For example, he also studied at a normal school and has accumulated more than ten "half-year" experiences. Now he has a dozen employment certificates and diplomas to be inspected, then he will definitely pass without objection—and he is a first-class teacher in terms of experience, so abundant, is it possible that he is a good teacher who just talks the talk? From now on, there will be no more "half year"? Heaven knows!</p>
<p>This is really a difficult problem. Those in charge of administration can say: "According to you, can any Tom, Dick, or Harry be a public educator? No need for inspection, no need for qualification?" I dare not say that. I just feel that those with certificates are not necessarily Tom, Dick, or Harry, and those without certificates may be talented. Wang Anshi's "Biography of Lord Mengchang of Redemption" says it well: "The appearance of crowing chickens and thieving dogs in his door is why scholars do not come!" China's talents and people with special skills sometimes prefer to be buried rather than be in the same trough as ordinary horses, of course, this is too individualistic and is not worth learning, but the fact is that losing ten talents because of this is something that cannot be helped.</p>
<p>From a historical point of view, this method of emphasizing qualifications is also out of necessity. In ancient times, elections were the norm, with filial piety and integrity, and those who understood the classics and practiced virtue... In the Han Dynasty, each county and state would elect one person for every 200,000 people. Whether democratic or not, it generally paid more attention to public opinion, which was a rational path. After the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the population migrated, and the election administration was interrupted. War is the source of all evils. From then on, the method of investigation and recommendation was equivalent to being abolished. During Cao Cao's time, Chen Qun suggested the Nine-Rank System, although "the upper ranks have no poor families, and the lower ranks have no aristocratic families," it still couldn't completely abandon public justice. Xu Shao of Runan was a specialist in upholding justice. When the "stopping-year system" came, it officially moved towards the path of qualification, which used the length of service as the standard for qualification. Talent and intelligence were not considered, which was criticized by many people in the past. After the imperial examination system arose, the stopping-year system was no longer in effect, but it was still embedded in the imperial examination, because those who had already served all had to look at their seniority to be promoted.</p>
<p>In reality, this is not comparable to today. Although the method of imperial examination has flaws, its greatest feature is that it provides equal opportunities for the general public. Now, clerks and secretaries need to take exams and have qualifications, middle school teachers need qualifications, and elementary school teachers need qualifications: but how many department heads and university presidents have come from being clerks and secretaries! Only state officials are allowed to set fires, what's the point?</p>
<h3>Strange Turtle</h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>The Central Zoo in New York City, USA, recently received a pair of rare turtles donated by explorer York. Their flesh is pale, their shells are scarlet, and one eye is pale blue while the other is black. The audience was amazed.</p>
<h3>Remembering Xiong Binghuang</h3>
<p>— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion</p>
<p>Xiong Binghuang, also known as Taixi, passed away in Hong Kong at the end of the 26th year of the Republic of China, which is now the tenth anniversary. Dr. Hu Shi, a famous figure in Macau, wrote a commemorative article, and Madam Xiong, Ms. Mao, wrote a long article describing the process of avoiding the plague and dying from overwork. Xiong was from Fenghuang Hall in Hunan Province, a tribute student in the Ren Chen year, and was selected as a Jinshi in the Jia Wu year, becoming a Shuchang in the Hanlin Academy. In the Wu Xu year, he participated in the Reform Movement in his hometown with Chen Sanli Boyan and others. Several years later, with the help of Zhao Erxun and Zhan Ze, he was appointed as a Supervisory Officer in the three eastern provinces, and was granted the title of Salt Transport Commissioner. In the second year of the Republic of China, he became the Prime Minister of the State Council. He resigned in the third year and devoted himself to social undertakings, founding a charitable orphanage in Xiangshan, Pingxi, to educate poor children, which was a great merit. In the 25th year, he married Mao Yanwen at Moore Hall in Shanghai. Taixi was sixty-six years old, and Mao was thirty-three years old, totaling ninety-nine. White hair and rosy cheeks were praised as a good match. Xiong's late wife, Zhu, had passed away. Mao had a long-standing friendship with the family and was a younger generation. Zhu Tingqi, the Director of the Guanwu Department, and the three families all had kinship relations, so it was arranged. The Beijing press commissioned me to write a wedding couplet that would include all of the above points, so I embellished it as follows: "At the age of near antiquity, playing a song of phoenix seeking phoenix, ninety-nine elixirs are completed, just as thirty-three lines are fulfilled, ascending to the court of Zhu Tingqi, seeing the appearance of Mao Yanwen, a double fulfillment of wishes, who says that sixty-six is incapable." The Shanghai newspapers carried Mrs. Feng's saying, "Old classmates become new aunts," and "Old uncle becomes big brother-in-law," clarifying the generations, which was amusing.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th" Incident, followed by the "January 28th" Incident, the government convened the "National Crisis Conference," and Xiong was invited. At that time, Wang Jingwei mentioned during the weekly memorial service in Luoyang that "the Twenty-One Demands to Japan in 1915 were signed by Yuan Shikai and co-signed by Xiong Binghuang, a member of today's National Crisis Conference. This person is still in Shanghai. If he comes here, we will kill him!" Xiong saw the report, angry and laughing, and immediately wrote two letters to Wang, saying: "1915 was the fourth year of the Republic of China. I had already resigned as Prime Minister of the State Council in March of the third year of the Republic of China, more than a year apart. Who co-signed this? If you check the government gazette, you will know the mistake. This matter is really a joke, not just an ordinary 'misattribution.' According to the historical record, the one who signed the treaty with the Japanese envoy, Ijuin Hikokichi, in the fourth year of the Republic of China was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lu Zhengxiang, and the one who co-signed the order to announce the treaty was the Secretary of State, Xu Shichang, which has nothing to do with Xiong. Wang's words were frivolous, so absurd, and his attitude was excited, seemingly patriotic and anti-Japanese, with boiling blood, reaching the extreme. Who would have expected that during the occupation period, he would become the leader of the puppet government, a traitor who flattered Japan, while the Xiong he wanted to kill preserved his integrity and never changed his principles until death. Human feelings are unpredictable, truly hard to say in one word.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk about Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Looking at the Ruby Queen cigarette held between my fingers, I feel that the burden of life is getting heavier and heavier. From "Good Luck," "Marquis," "Great Front Gate" to today's "British Brand," I can't help but sigh at the sadness of life. In a few days, I may only be able to "enjoy" "Hartmann's" or "Old Knife Brand."</p>
<p>Saying that smoking cigarettes is a kind of "enjoyment" in life may not win the sympathy of some people, because even opium can be quit, let alone a few cigarettes. However, for those who know what a wonderfully indescribable thing a cigarette is, they must also know that quitting opium is even more difficult—difficult because cigarettes do not have a real "addiction," difficult because they have a kind of unforgettable pleasure. For those who do not yet have the habit of smoking cigarettes, I will never move them to try, because this is a personal habit and cannot be forced. Conversely, for those who have already experienced the pleasure, I will never advise them to quit, because not only am I a failed trier myself, but I have also seen countless enthusiasts return to their original "positions." Now I have already suppressed myself with the determination of unwavering resolve, vowing to become a lifelong comrade of the "cigarette smokers."</p>
<p>After smoking, if one suddenly has the intention to quit, it generally stems from three motivations. The first is economic, the second is illness, and the third is spiritual self-reflection. Let's not talk about the first two reasons for now. The so-called spiritual self-reflection often arises from those who have been smoking for a long time. Many young people who usually keep themselves clean and dislike smoking and drinking later unconsciously develop the habit of smoking on accidental occasions, and sometimes they can't help but feel guilty, thinking that they have lost the identity of a good young person, and even secretly worrying that smoking may be the beginning of their degenerate lives.</p>
<p>However, this is unnecessary worry. Because smoking cigarettes is different from smoking opium after all. The anesthetic power of opium can make a person's life indulge in it and sink into the black sea, no longer hoping for anything else. Although the nicotine contained in cigarettes also has some anesthetic effect, for example, the Maya people who first discovered tobacco regarded the anesthetic effect in tobacco as a kind of divinity, and the first European to smoke cigarettes, Rochelic Cartier de Hares, was even tried by the religious court for this reason, but the anesthetic effect of cigarettes is only a slight stimulus. The effect it gives people is a faint excitement. If you think that even this faint excitement should be rejected, then I dare say that you have taken the meaning of life too seriously.</p>
<p>People who like to drink or taste tea feel comfortable with a cup in hand. But drinking and drinking tea are only suitable for leisure, because holding a cup in hand is not suitable for many occasions, and it is not suitable to carry it around everywhere. Cigarettes are different. You feel something unusual when you hold this small thing with its fine thickness and suitable length in your hand. When you strike a match with a snap and exhale the first wisp of green smoke, you immediately experience an indescribable comfort. If you are idle, holding a cup in one hand (whether it is tea or wine) and a cigarette in the other, looking at the white clouds floating in the sky, then you only feel relaxed and happy, and only you can understand the momentary pleasure.</p>
<p>This is not an exaggeration, because although not every cigarette can bring about such a state, such a state does exist for those who know how to smoke. I am not against quitting smoking for economic or health reasons, but it is unnecessary to want to quit smoking because of puritanical ideas. In this era of difficult living, some light stimulation and excitement should be said to be a necessity of life, because what you get from it is not anesthesia, but clarity and invigoration.</p>
<p>However, the habit of smoking cigarettes, like everything that belongs to the category of habits, should not be indulged in excessively. I have seen many people who are addicted to smoking to the point of never letting go of the "roll" (rolled cigarette) all day long, causing them to cough and choke, harming their health, which seems not to understand the function of cigarettes. In my opinion, a limit of about ten cigarettes a day, and enjoying them at the time you feel most suitable, is the only way to truly enjoy the pleasure of smoking.</p>
<h3>Cat Catches Fish</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Cats are cunning animals, and there are many stories about the methods they use to catch fish.</p>
<p>Someone saw a cat poking its head next to a small pond and thought it was drinking water, but upon closer inspection, they realized that their observation was wrong. It turned out that it was using its tongue as bait to lure the fish to the surface of the water. When the fish really were lured to the surface, it quickly opened its mouth wide and bit those foolish fish.</p>
<p>Cats can also reverse this method, putting their tails below the surface of the water, and when a fish swims up to see what the furry thing is, the cat swiftly turns around and uses its sharp claws to hook the fish alive, its "hand" speed making fishermen admire it.</p>
<p>However, the most agile cat's fishing technique was discovered next to a goldfish pond. In this case, it was two cats working together to complete their stealing. Because the goldfish were constantly disappearing, the fish owner became suspicious, so one night, he quietly hid by the pond and waited. Soon, the fish thieves came, but they were not people, but two cats. They approached the fish pond, lowered their heads, almost touching the surface of the water, their pupils dilated eyes shining in the moonlight. They waited motionless for a while, then, with a sudden pounce, a leaping goldfish was brought out. The only explanation for this is that the cats used their shining eyes to bewitch and lure the poor fish to the surface of the water, and then captured them.</p>
<p>Although the stealing of cats is annoying, the stealing behavior also shows a kind of cunning.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (38)</p>
<p>Qi Wan, feeling greatly humiliated by this song, went backstage and burst into tears, repeatedly saying she couldn't bear it, wouldn't sing anymore, and was willing to return the contracted fee. The garden owner repeatedly apologized and pleaded, but Qi Wan kept saying that she couldn't endure such humiliation and insisted on leaving. Later, her brother He Zhou repeatedly tried to persuade her, saying, "Tonight's incident was just a rowdy affair, and you can't entirely blame them. The flyers were printed that way. If you leave in anger and break the contract with the garden, that's fine, but causing such a spectacle in Jinan will make it difficult to face people back home, and Father wouldn't approve either! Now, the most important thing is to restore your reputation. I think very few people here understand real art; most are just here for the name. Their goal isn't the performance, but the novelty. Like last time, when Wu Hongfang performed spinning cotton here, it was packed every day. Wu Hongfang built his big house by spinning cotton, which shows the level of appreciation here. Now that we're at this crucial juncture, we can't afford to be petty; we need to be flexible and adapt. If you agree to perform spinning cotton, I'm sure we can sell out every show, not only restoring your reputation but also increasing our contracted fee. I'll explain it to Father later, and he'll surely understand. Success or failure depends on this one move; you need to be brave and do it, don't back down." After He Zhou's persuasion, Qi Wan thought it over and felt that this was the only way to go. She discussed it with the garden management and agreed to perform spinning cotton. On her first day on stage, Qi Wan added extra novelty, imitating her father's rough voice and singing a section of "Dingjun Mountain," which won the audience's applause. The next day, when she performed spinning cotton, even more spectators came eagerly, and the garden was packed. Adding stools and selling extra tickets, it became a sensation. For seven days, she performed spinning cotton every day, and it was always sold out. The locals seemed to have a never-ending fascination with this play. Seeing that her reputation had been restored and the contract was about to expire, Qi Wan wanted to stop while she was ahead, but the garden owner refused, repeatedly begging her to renew the contract, increase the fee, and extend it for another two weeks. Qi Wan, compelled by the crowd's enthusiasm, had no choice but to agree. Qi Wan was very clever. Seeing the audience's psychology, she always added a new gimmick to each performance of spinning cotton, making the locals want to see more. Everyone talked about spinning cotton, predicting what the new gimmick would be tonight, and the play became a craze. Qi Wan, having achieved both fame and fortune, was at the peak of her popularity when a urgent telegram arrived from Beijing: "Gu Hezhou of Beiyang Theater, father critically ill, return immediately, He Shan." He Zhou received the telegram at eleven o'clock at night. Qi Wan was still on stage performing spinning cotton and hadn't finished the show. Although He Zhou was anxious, he didn't dare to disturb her. He waited until she finished the show, took off her makeup, and returned to the hotel before showing her the telegram. Qi Wan, upon seeing the words "critically ill" in the telegram, burst into tears, saying, "Let's go back quickly, I won't sing anymore!" He Zhou said, "It's not that simple. You have a contractual relationship with the garden, and you can't leave. I'll go back first thing in the morning. If you need to come back, you can come back then." Qi Wan cried, "What if something unexpected happens? How can I face Father?" He Zhou said, "Even if you go back, it won't help. Besides, He Shan has always been timid and loves to exaggerate. Perhaps Father's condition isn't that serious. I'll go back and see first."</p>

<h3>Telegraph Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>(Question from Gu Qifeng of Weihaiwei Road) I plan to send a telegram to congratulate a friend in Beiping on their wedding. I heard that your bureau offers a social telegram service and can attach gift certificates. What is the procedure? (Answer) Social telegrams are used for congratulations and condolences. Special telegram paper is used, and there are special "idioms" for the sender to choose from. The text is divided into "self-composed" and "ready-made" types. Chinese is charged at 1,000 yuan per character, with a minimum of twenty characters; English is charged at 1,000 yuan per character, with a minimum of ten characters. If there is no "self-composed" text, you can choose any sentence from the ready-made sentences on the back of the newspaper as the text, regardless of length, and it will be calculated as eight characters. The recipient's name and address, and the sender's signature are calculated on a per-character basis. The word "social" should be written at the beginning of the telegram as a label, which is counted as one character. For the procedure to attach gift certificates, first obtain a "Gift Certificate Application Form" from this bureau, fill it out according to the instructions, and deliver it together with the gift money and handling fee (3,000 yuan). This bureau will issue a receipt as proof. The amount of the gift certificate is set from 10,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, divided into scarlet and plain colors, specified by the sender. If the recipient does not wish to accept the gift, they can decline it and return it to the telegraph bureau within three days.</p>
