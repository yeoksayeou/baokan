<h3 id="c23">日本重整軍備的警號！ <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>美國扶助日本復興的政策，已由經濟的扶助進而爲軍事的扶助了。五月一日東京成立的「海上保安廳」，以大久保健夫爲廳長，並於橫漬新瀉名古屋等地設置海運所，擁有武裝人員八千人，保安監察艦三十八艘，在日本領海內輪流巡視。這便是麥克阿瑟最近特准，未通過遠東委員會和管制日本委員會，而逕自復活日本海軍武裝的一種措施。美國官方雖然聲明，海上保安廳實際上並不武裝；但是，盟總道事的措施太欠愼重考慮了，它必震憾全世界，使人們驚心動魄的，感到這是日本重整軍備的警號！</p>
<p>日本自接受波茨坦宣言無條件投降後，全部武裝組織一概解散，海軍陸軍兩省及空軍組織亦作形式上的取消。惟陸海軍的設備和器械，仍然完整保留，未予處置，隨時可以重建起來的。年來日本地下組織，潛伏活動甚力，企圖恢復武裝。去年五月日外務省某官員，就曾要求於盟軍佔領狀熊終止後，設立陸軍十萬人，以此試探盟國的態度。當時由於中英蘇各國的反對，盟總非正式的拒絕了日本的要求。但盟總允許日本保有小額武裝警察，其他足以成爲重整軍備之任何表現，則於和約未締結前，概不予以考慮。乃此事迄今甫一年，盟總即准許了日本海上保安應的設置，並聞麥帥竟有意准許該應於最　將來，武裝人員由八千擴充至一萬，艦隊實力由卅八組增加至一百卅五艘；這不啻准許日本重建海上武裝，而逐漸準備惟復海軍省了。此項措施，無論基於任何理由，對於太平洋國家都是一重威脅，我們都應該反對，並應有效地阻止日本重整軍備事態之發展。</p>
<p>（一）日本設置海上保安廳，是對太平洋沿岸國家的一種新威脅。此次盟總准許日本恢復海上武裝，理由是防止朝鮮人非法進入日本走私，需要以海上警力採取嚴竣的行動。日政府以韓人非法活動爲藉口，更不信擴大大阪市排擊韓人的行動，以企圖達到增加警察實力之目的。事實上，日本現有警力足够阻止走私，以及鎭壓任何走私韓人的活動。據我們所知，韓人在日本領海內，並無大量的走私活動；反之，日本的走私組織則屹然存在，走私活動現已深入到台灣福建香港等地。所以說日本設置海上保安廳，以阻止韓人走私爲藉口，乃是一種欺騙，而眞正的目的，是要重建日本海上的武裝，對太平洋國家予以新的威脅。</p>
<p>（二）日本海上武裝之重建，有招致日本海軍再建之危機，這個事態的發展，是這反了開羅宣言和波茨坦宣言的精神，甚至違反了違東委員會對日基本政策的決定。一九四三年十一月廿二日的開羅宣言，說明「三大盟國此次進行戰爭之目的，在於制止及懲罰日本侵略」；制止日本侵略之目的，是解除其有形與無形的武裝，並懲罰其使用武裝之侵略者，藉以消滅戰爭，制止戰爭於未來的空間和時間發生。一九四五年七月廿六日的彼茨坦宣言，列舉「吾人堅持將負責之窮兵購武主義驅出世界；欺騙及錯誤領導日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威權及勢力，必須永久剷除」，而「直至日本製造戰爭之力量業已毀滅有確實可信之證據時」，因此盟國對於日本政府，「立即宣體所有武裝部隊無條件投降，並對此種行動有意實行予以適當之各項保證」。因為盟書要獲取日本毀滅戰解除武裝力量之證據，故設管制日本委員會及盟軍統部，以監督日本對波茨坦宣言條款之履行。詎料渡次坦宣言尚未澈底重澈，而佔領軍即準許日本武裝之恢復，這就華異自毀渡茨坦宣言的神聖紀戰。四月廿八日管制日本委員會開會時，美代表施巴德提出日設海上保安廳案討論，中英蘇代表一致反對，蘇代表希望本案由達東委員會決定後再行實施，這是很合理的主張。遠東委員會為盟國對日政策的最高決策者，根據遠委會一九四七年六月廿日公佈的對日基本政策，「解除武裝與廢棄軍備，乃軍事佔領之初步任務，應迅速而決然的予以完成」。麥帥此項措施，其不願提請遠東委會，是因為他的擅專實際上遠反遠東委員會的政策決定。</p>
<p>（三）對日和約未締結，賠償問題未解決之前，日本利用船舶設備，重建海上武裝，影響對盟國商船的賠償，甚至可能究全不賠償了。太平洋沿岸國家對日作戰的船舶損失，最大的是我中國，其次是菲澳英荷。美國認爲日本商船應在二三百萬噸之間，我國則認日本有此一半已足，迄今尙朱解決商船噸位的賠償問題。現在日本設置海上保安廳，綻握的軍艦每艘皆數百噸，每小時可駛行十海浬的活動團，這都是盟國所要爭取的賠償品。</p>
<p>從上述幾項說明，我們知道道次盟總的片而措施，不僅進一步扶助日本重振海上武裝，這反了開罷宣言波茨坦宣言，和遠東委員會的對日決策，並且損害了盟國的船舶設備的賠償。這是何等重大的一件事啊！希望我國政府和太平洋沿岸國家，迅謀有效的對策，並阻止日本重整軍備的企圖！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕夜來風雨，倘今日放　，則全部　賽，除男女網球，男乒乓外，自茲皆進入循環錦標賽階段矣。田徑戰全部決賽，亦爲最後一日，不聞不語長跑英雄樓文敖所參加之萬米決賽，允爲令日之精彩一幕。據大會當局稱：老天若是傾盆大雨，各項節目當俟大會臨時決定，惟室內比賽節目，則不問天晴天雨，一律照常舉行。</p>
<p>昨爲大會第五日，適逢星期例假，晨間陽光柔煦·氣爽風和，大上海市民，大上海汽車，幾以殺倒能勢奔向集中下列三地：市中心區，虹橋機場，及逸國。</p>
<p>大會會塲方而：江灣　，其美路，各種車輛，皆自東而西，首尾銜接，最擁塞時，行車以每小時十哩速度緩進，如蠕動之百節長蛇。田徑塲，籃球塲，網球塲，體育館，甚至並無節目之游泳池，觀衆亦滿坑滿谷。西司令台前文化街，尤爲雜沓。據初步估計，觀衆約在十五萬人以上，人氣沸騰，達於瘋在。田徑塲大看台膨脹，觀衆紛紛躍入塲內者三四千人。塲內秩序混亂一片，進行中之比賽曾一度中止。警衛組全體人員，竟日緊張工作，異常努力，而未肇生意外，厥功尤偉。</p>
<p>虹橋機塲方面：傘兵七十人作我國首次之跳傘表演觀衆達十萬餘人。汽車三千餘輛阻塞虹橋路全部交通。逸園方面：上下午各有一塲足球半複賽，五萬餘球迷，麕聚塲外，萬頭攢動。</p>
<p>男子鐵餅爲昨日之豐碩收獲，冠亞軍分別以四一公尺五五及四一公尺一五五破全國紀錄，第三名亦破大會紀錄。</p>
<p>男子田徑賽得分統計：台灣又增六分，共得一百十一分半已　握錦標，毫無問題。其餘名次，未有變化，空軍四十七，上海四十一，海軍三十四分。女子田徑，河北仍列前茅，又加一分爲廿六分，北平廿三分第二，靑島台灣各以十六分緊追於後，將爲河北之威脅。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日田賽，有男鐵餅及女跳遠決賽二項，男子鐵餅演出精彩，第一第二兩名成績，均破全國紀錄。第三名亦破大會紀錄，實屬難能可貴。女子跳遠，成績平平，茲分誌比賽經過如次：</p>
<p>男子鐵餅，報名者五十一人，實到卅人，二時許始擲，未幾看台觀衆衝入塲內，秩序大亂，比賽一度中止，秩序恢復後再擲。預賽三擲中，過卅米者僅十人。鉛球冠軍天津齊沛霖，昨在預賽最後一擲時，突然超過全國紀錄之標誌·丈量之下，得四一·五五公尺，即以此成績領導羣雄。空軍王瑞，預賽中最高成績三九·一六公尺，鬱鬱不得志。決賽階段，每　均有進境，最後一擲，居然亦越出全國紀錄之標誌，直叫老齊揑把冷汗。丈量之下，得四一·一五五公尺，屈居第二。台劉敬得第三，舊全國紀錄保持者遼寗郭健章（即郭潔），人老珠黃，僅得三五·六七五公尺，退居第四。各大名次成績，有如後列：</p>
<p>（一）齊沛霖（津）　四一·五五公尺</p>
<p>（二）王瑞（空）　四一·一五五公尺</p>
<p>（三）劉敬（台）　三八·五四公尺</p>
<p>（四）郭健章（遼）　三五·六七五公尺</p>
<p>（五）郁宗雄（台）　三三·九八公尺</p>
<p>（六）吳振武（海）　三三·八三公尺</p>
<p>女子跳遠，參加比跳者，不下卅餘人，混戰多時，過四米者僅八人。預賽時靑島陳瑞年，首跳即以四·六儿五公尺佔先，陳小姐跳躍姿勢絕佳，惜其後諸跳，略露疲　致成績未能卯上。福建陳碧英，冠軍呼聲最高，惟昨日預賽數跳，成績未見出色。決賽階段最後一跳，咬緊牙關，使出混身解數，始獲四·八三公尺，一舉而壓倒靑島小陳。其他諸子，除台灣張甘妹於決賽時稍有進境外，均之進展成績。最後決定名次成績如次：</p>
<p>（一）陳碧英（閩）四·八三公尺</p>
<p>（二）陳瑞年（靑）四·六九五公尺</p>
<p>（三）吳淑英（閩）四·四七公尺</p>
<p>（四）張甘妹（台）四·三九公尺</p>
<p>（五）林振基（京）四·三四公尺</p>
<p>（六）趙宏（冀）四·一九公尺</p>

<p>男女徑賽，昨日全部爲預複賽，男子組預賽，爲：八百公尺，千六百接力，複賽，爲：二百公尺及中欄。女子組預賽，爲：六十公尺，及四百公尺接力，複賽，爲：六十公尺及二百公尺。</p>
<p>男子預賽，八百尺分三組舉行，老將于希渭獲第三組第一各，成績二分八秒七，爲三組中最佳者，勝來甚易，拋落第二名約十餘米。其他二組第一名，爲遼寗李令龍及靑島宋文堅，合灣陳英郞註册而未曾下場。今日將由十二名入選者決賽。千六百公尺接力賽舉行時，天已下雨，冒雨賽畢，成績平平。台灣隊爲三組中成績最佳之一組，亦達三分四十三秒六，今日決賽，盼能改進。中欄複賽分三組，仍以馬華黃兩正之第一組成績最佳，五十九秒四，與大會紀錄五十九秒正，相差不遠。其餘二組，俱在六十秒以上，黃兩正包辦兩欄冠軍，當無問題。二百公尺複賽，前日次賽成績之最佳者全部入選，此項亦冒雨舉行，故二十三秒六之成績，平平而已。今日決賽，上海容承彪與台灣選手，將有一塲劇烈爭奪戰。</p>
<p>女子預賽，六十公尺分八組舉行，靑島王淑桂，重慶李心一兩組成績，俱爲八秒六，其餘竟有超過九秒者。複賽時，王淑桂又縮短十分之一秒，以八秒五獲第二組第一名。今日決賽，前日一百公尺優勝之幾位女將，王淑桂，李心一，郭美麗，李小壁又將一決高下，看來王淑桂穩可再得一項冠軍。二百公尺複賽，福建陳碧英於獲得跳遠冠軍後，出塲競賽，廿九秒二，成續最佳，其餘入選者，仍爲王淑桂，李心一，李小瓊，梅舜顏等。惟廿九秒餘之成績，實在太差，冒雨舉行，或爲减色原因之一。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕足球錦標賽複賽，昨全日四組分在田徑塲，逸園舉行，觀衆乘星期假日前往兩處參觀者，紛至沓來，四塲均座無隙地，盛况空前。觀衆皆關心最後四隊究將誰屬？八隊大軍亦竭力爭奪，故塲內外緊張情緒打成一片，精彩脚頭與嘈雜掌聲遙相呼應，熱烈異常。比賽結果，全部不出本報預料：香港以三比〇勝浙江，警察以二比一挫暹華，上海以三比一退大連，陸軍則以三比一克馬華·港·警·滬·陸四隊明日起即次第短兵相接，再爭冠軍寳座。昨上午曾有日蝕，午後忽降陣　，四塲比賽均在日蝕及豪雨中進口，直至結束。上海對大連一塲，以大連隊員毆辱裁判，略有紛擾，大會及該隊方面，迄晚尙在會商解決辦法中。至前日因天雨未克舉行之足球落選賽兩塲，昨午後在中正公園補賽，結果靑島以一比〇勝貴州，漢口以二比二和菲列賓，嗣又因天雨，未延長時間，定今日在田徑塲重賽。</p>
<h3 id="c79">浙江力不從心　港隊怪腳連中三元 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>香港對浙江一場，上午九時在逸園舉行，裁判李國義，巡邊鄧效良，張志仁。開球後，港隊先攻，前綫五鋒推進極爲迅速，來往衝殺之間，港隊中鋒李德祺（在港有怪脚之稱）得球在中綫　射，首吿入網。浙隊力反攻，時雨後初霄，草地頗滑，浙隊雖力圖進取，奈傳遞太慢，聯絡欠活，脚頭尤嫌無力故略一遲疑，爲港衛衝上，但吿跌倒，前功盡棄。其後機會失之頻頻，該隊每有一人射門，或稍徧，或越綫，看台上滿座之數千觀衆，均齊聲惋惜。旋港隊進攻益亟，幸浙隊後方諸衛及門守，尙能稱職，且屢救險球，博得不少喝采聲。浙隊雖敗而猶能鼓餘勇反搏，觀衆督策之力量實大。但不幸上半時終塲前，港隊李德麒得李春發之傳，又帶球疾進，橫掃一脚，擦地破門，二比〇使浙隊重振聲勢之信心大為減少。</p>
<p>換場後，觀衆對浙隊政勵贊助之掌聲，仍此起彼落，因此蕭子文，林典義均曾有數次全力射門，惟港隊棋高一着，馮坤勝及譚均幹防護備至，擋出數球，淸晰可觀。在浙隊毫無收穫之窘態下，中衛吳嘉邦又吿犯規，李德祺在二十五碼處罰球，一蹴中的。嗣後浙隊左翼吳炳浩受傷下塲，鏖戰移時，時間終結，港隊終以禿項李德祺之三脚，奪獲決賽權。</p>
<h3 id="c80">暹羅球運坎坷　警察雖強僅勝一球 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>警察與暹羅之戰，賽來未見精采。暹羅隊後衛軟弱，前鋒雖尙差强人意，惜球運不佳，曾有三次射球皆中門柱彈出，否則局勢或可改觀也。警察實力平均，惟演出亦並不如理想之佳，故結果僅以二比一僅勝一球，雨後塲地泥濘，當亦爲重大原因。</p>
<p>上半時警察順風而攻，球常在暹羅腹地。四分鐘時，暹後衛胡琴書在塲邊截得球踢出，反而踢至球門正前方，警察中鋒趙富來得正好，盤球直入，暹羅隊員見狀　湧來救，混亂中趙富一脚直入網心，一比〇首開紀錄。暹羅傾師反攻，十二分鐘時右鋒黃均欽得機斜射，球中門槓彈出，左內鋒梁順發跑遲一步，失去叩門良機。此後球又常在暹羅門前，險象環生。二十二分時，警察譚振輝犯規，暹羅黃景欽開任意球，傳與韓景豐，拉起一脚中門槓彈出，梁順發接着再來一脚，又中左邊門柱，球運坎坷，觀衆均爲之惋惜。二十六分　時，警察謝錦河開任意球，傳與趙富，暹羅監視不嚴，趙富乘隙攻門，又吿中的，成二比零。此後暹羅前鋒數度攻門，均被警察球門余耀德接住救出，上半時結束，暹羅凈輸兩球。休息後再戰，暹羅漸入住境。五分鐘時，右內鋒鄭有志在警察門前急射如飛，不料又中門槓彈回而被警察內衛救出。八分鐘時，鄭有志又得後方來球，單槍匹馬直入警察禁地，在離門十餘碼處飛起一脚，應聲入網，脚頭淸脆之至。退羅板回此球後，戰情大爲緊張，雙方你來我往，各有數次射門，但均得越未中。將終塲時，警察劉天由截球「吃螺絲」，暹羅鄭有志一脚遠傳至左前方，時警察全師盡出，腹地虛無一人，暹羅左前鋒陳景興急奔而上，在球門或前方脚頭起處，即也吃了個「螺絲」，失去最後機會，未幾時間終了，警察二比一勝暹羅。</p>
<h3 id="c81">大連神經緊張　上海有勁反敗為勝 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>上海大連一仗，戰况甚爲緊張殺搏。大連隊雖然氣力充沛，但驍勇有餘而聯絡不够，且神經太爲緊張，比賽進行中屢次與裁判徐紹武爲罰球而爭執，致比賽結束後發生毆打裁判之不愉快事件。上海隊之前逢短傳技巧甚佳，中衛長腳譚福　進退有方，後衛亦不差，故勝來綽綽有餘。</p>
<p>細雨紛霏中鳴笛開塲，大連攻勢猛烈，滬隊沉着應戰。十五分鐘時大連左鋒蔣本深邊軍深入，首開紀錄。滬隊節節反攻，大連內衛犯規判罰十二碼，滬隊孫錦順主踢，恰中門柱彈出。雙方拉鋸片刻，各有幾次射門，均無收獲。未幾大連王政文犯規，滬隊罰任意球，恰傳落於球門前，夏體先趕上一脚撥入，一比一扳成和局。幾分鐘後滬隊五鋒齊進，短傳至近球門處，韓龍海斜射一脚，大述球門躍起擋接不及，二比一滬隊勝一球。</p>
<p>下半時戰情更見激烈，濘滑之球場中時見人仰馬翻，但　戰良久，各無建樹，直至將終塲時，滬隊李垚開角球，數傳至韓龍海，在離門約三十碼處，飛起一脚高球，恰到好處，但見球自空中徐徐下降，正　進人球門，大連守門欲救無方，三比一結束戰局</p>
<h3 id="c82">馬華前銳後疲　陸軍沉着挽轉乾坤 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>下午陸軍對馬華於逸園之戰，觀衆人山人海。馬華恃其驚人之衝擊，上半時勇猛進搏，攻勢幾毫無間歇，而下半時氣燄盡歛，鬆弛不堪，陸軍始以沉着之戰略應銳，終又以熟練之脚法攻堅致馬華卒遭敗衂。上半時馬華兩後衛，竭智保衛後方，傳前鋒悉心前進，功不在小，故左內鋒梁開明得以摒除萬難，從容叩門，黃仕傑接住後又復落入，馬華賴此一球奠基。旋中鋒梅潤華傷脚，補入李司達，陸軍在敵軍調整陣容後之瞬間，大舉進攻，左翼金祿生數次射門，雖爲黃錦堂撲出，但終塲前卒爲費春華在紛亂中所乘，左角長挑，扳成和局。</p>
<p>下半時開始，兩隊依然混戰，時觀衆爲此兩强之和局，久久毫無進展，焦急不耐，鼓掌叫喊，情緒幾近沸騰，陸軍受此啓示，奮力搏鬥，羅壽福及金祿生於十數分鐘內久進一球，大局遂定於三比一意料中之成績。</p>

<p>盧昌泰被扣押</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕足球錦標賽大運負於上海後，認爲裁判徐紹武執法不公，比賽甫畢，若千球員即追逐裁判，向渠交涉，幸旁觀之大會職員及其他裁判在比賽進行時已見情勢不穩，恐賽後發生事端，早已通知大批警局飛行堡壘警員預爲戒備，此時見狀乃立即飛奔上前，但徐紹武已被抓住頭髮，吃了一拳。西司令台上觀衆見大連隊員行動越軌，大起公憤，喊打之聲，鬨成一片，幸經飛行堡壘竭力維持秩序，將裁判徐紹武護送至警衛室內，同時將行凶之大連後備隊員盧昌泰加以扣押。事發後，全體足球裁判向大會提出嚴重抗議，要求嚴懲行凶隊員及保障此後安全。大速領隊劉化鵾及東北代表劉長春則請求大會將被扣隊員先予釋放。總幹事郝更生認爲此事須裁判方面願意和解始可解決。劉等旋與裁判方面商議，迄深晚尙無結果，同時大會昨晚會議中決定自今日起再加强警衛力量，以維護安全。</p>

<p>第四種「打」事件昨天發生了，那是球員打裁判。（（一）某某打大會職員，（二）（三）大會職員打大會職員，（三）球員打球員，（四）球員打裁判。）賸下來的脚色是訛呢？觀衆和記者了。</p>
<p>昨天的打人好漢，據說還被拘押在警察局裏，未獲解決，無論從哪一個觀點，我們都主張嚴辦，目的自然在遏止萬延。</p>
<p>不過倘是一齣殺鷄唬猴，那就未免卑劣，凌弱畏强，賢者所不取也。</p>
<p>買了票子而不能入塲，這就是被欺詐。大會不應該這樣詐欺取財的；倘使再有混水摸魚情事，那就不堪說了。</p>
<p>退票還錢，做不到，我很担心那幾座售票亭。臺灣代表隊，一個令人感動而又可愛的行列，可惜就是這麼一個行列，嗚呼，眞不知要再來若干嗚呼矣。　他們整隊來、整隊去，隊旗在前，來去都高歌，沿路接受鼓掌與歡呼。我認爲這是本屆全運會唯一的光榮，我不重視那引起破什麼全國紀錄，甚至破什麼世界紀錄，做到每個單位都能這樣的守紀律，即使百米十八秒，跳遠五公尺，不算醜惡。（O，K，）</p>

<h3 id="c87">男子籃球複賽　上海大敗海軍　聯勤菲華警察上海獲決賽權 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕九日男籃已達奪決賽權之複賽階段，聯勤勇克天津，菲律濱力挫空軍，警察智勝瀋陽，上海大敗海軍。以上聯勤，菲律濱，警察，上海，均獲得決賽權，此四塲中，當以聯勤對天津最爲緊張，茲分誌戰况於下：</p>
<p>聯動克天津</p>
<p>下午三時舉行，開賽後天津李漢亭犯規，鄭大光主罰未中，聯勤數度兵臨天津城下，均未擊破。王士選犯規，天津罰中一分，天津犯規，聯勤賈志軍也罰中，一比一，李漢亭犯規，志軍再罰又中，成二比一。天津前鋒遙擲獲分，張長祿再添兩分，成五比二。天津李漢亭又犯規，聯勤獲兩次罰球權，均告中的，五五平局。賈志軍遞與廖滌航，廖遠遞曹志吉，曹反身遞賈，躍起托入，志軍再度報捷，九比五聯勤佔先。天津罰一中一，八比九；廖滌航罰中，成十比八。斯時互爭於一二分之間，聯勤連中三元，天津不及趕上，上半時二十一對十六，聯勤佔先。</p>
<p>下半時局面仍緊張，鄭大光易卜彥适，曹志吉易張傳志，兩人與王，賈，廖打法不同，故連失二城，觀衆叫囂不已，以後卜仍替以鄭大光，張仍更爲曹志吉，局面稍穩。天津張長祿拼力殺入，獲一球，時間已到，三十七比三十，聯勤克天津，兩隊陣容犯規獲分如下：</p>

<p>總計　一八　三〇</p>
<p>菲華挫空軍</p>
<p>下午四時舉行。戰幕啓時，空軍犯規，陳金德罰中一分，空軍潘作樑罰而未中菲島余進攻下一城，罰又中，陳金置錦上添花，金德又罰中，七比〇聲勢顯赫。以後十四比三，十九比九，廿一比十一，二十一比十二，空軍屢圖反攻無效，菲島隊技術嫻熟，射籃已較八日爲準，一路領先，空軍無法超前，遂以五十三比卅九，菲島獲旋。兩隊陣容犯規獲分如下：</p>
<p>非島隊　犯　分</p>
<p>李世僑　二　七</p>

<p>警察勝瀋陽</p>
<p>下午七時舉行。開賽後瀋陽中鋒跳與左鋒，即疾進射而未中，警察犯規，瀋陽　而未中，警察反獲兩分，又罰進一分，又進一球，瀋陽亦罰中一球，成五比一。警察一帆風順，直至十八比七，二十比七，廿四比七，上半塲卅二比十一，警察佔先二十一分。</p>
<p>下半塲，分數互有增加，瀋陽仍無甚進展，五十二對三十五，警察獲捷。兩隊陳容犯規獲分如下：</p>
<p>警察隊　犯分</p>
<p>王蓉生　一　六</p>

<p>上海取海軍</p>
<p>下午一時舉行，跳開後上海吳成章運球被截奪，蔡連科又犯規，于瑞章罰中後，又獲兩分，惜海軍好景不長，劉政軍犯規，吳成章罰中，李震中深入籃下，跳起射球落網，三比三，震中犯規，海軍何立德罰中，成四比三。上海蔡文華單手斜射中的，成章又加兩分，成七比三，海軍于瑞章再度獲分，七比五猶圖上時。無如上海隊技術高人一等，運用職術戰略，打來輕鬆淸　，頻頻獲分，海軍祗有應戰，已無反攻能力，還以五十七比二十五，上海大勝海軍。兩隊陣容犯規獲分如下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全運會開幕日，因氣候不良而未舉行之傘兵跳傘表演，於昨日中午在虹橋機塲舉行。市民以節目新奇，興趣甚濃，上午十時以後，觀衆絡續向虹橋機塲集中，汽車，脚踏車，團體客串，及步行者創虹橋路上空前盛况。</p>
<p>機塲四周觀衆逾十萬人，汽車總數在三千輛以上，機塲秩序由民航空運大隊地勤部隊維持，嚴格限制觀衆走近機塲跑道。塲外由　警隊，幹訓團，憲兵等各單位，分段指揮交通。下午一時半以後到達之觀衆被阻於機塲外，均不得其門而入，高空跳傘遠近均可看見，被阻場外觀衆羣佔登前日軍所築之碉堡上，作臨時看台，大會無法控制天空，故免費招待，不售門票，因此觀衆亦格外擁擠。</p>
<p>表演跳傘之傘兵，包括戰鬥與地而共七十人，由傘兵司令部少將副司令徐炎武，及副處長楊春柏，副團長姜鍵率領。借用民航空運大隊Ｃ四六型一原門號」與「柳州號」運輸機兩架。「　門號」於十二時半昇空，由少校敎官羅學良先作試跳，嗣後即二人，四人，分組表演定點降落。</p>
<p>彩傘飄蘯　萬衆歡呼</p>
<p>「廈門號」低空斜飛，傘兵自機門躍出，白色降落傘迎風張開，飄盪空間，全塲觀衆報以熱烈掌聲。定點降落僅三組，瞬即表演完畢。「厦門號」落地後，全體傘兵重新集合，携帶槍械，再度登機。「厦門」，「柳州」兩機同時起飛，先繞場飛行二匝，地面部隊於機場中央施放紅色信號烟，飛機行經紅烟上空，傘兵即紛紛自機中，作二千呎集體降落，一時紅白綠三色彩傘點綴於蔚藍之天空中，宛如天女散花，全塲歡呼若在。</p>
<p>兩分鐘中　降二千呎</p>
<p>集體降落分兩組舉行，每組傘兵十八人，裝備傘三頂，每次降落共二十一傘，因昨日氣候適宜，故二千呎降落僅需時二分鐘，惟場地不平，且値雨後，積起不少大水潭，傘兵頗多降落於水潭中者，衣履盡濕。聞原擬於集體降落後，繼作戰鬥表演，實彈射擊，但因四周觀衆過多，恐生意外，乃臨時取消，故全部節目於干旱一刻即告完畢。其時尚有不少觀衆誤以爲下午三時舉行，正紛紛乘車趕來，與從機塲退出之汽車相遇途中，一進一出，虹橋路盡被阻塞，所有汽車不得不列隊緩行，　機塲至大西路竟費時達三小時之久，足見擁擠之一斑矣。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕當天津隊選手齊沛霖從領獎臺上退下來以後，記者趨前和他熱烈的握了一次手，祝賀他這次的擲鐵併以四十一米五五榮譽地打破了全國記錄。這時候，他眞値得驕傲，上屆記錄的保持者郭建章（潔），已經被他擊退到第四位了。</p>
<p>他謙遜地說：這次成績實在是偶然的獲得，他說在大津練習時，不過擲了四十米，而且預選也僅擲到卅八米而已，到上海以前，約摸練了一個月光景，成績也始終出不了四十米，但他又這樣吿訴記者，他在學生時代，却曾創造過四十二米的記錄。</p>
<p>他是河北高陽人，今年州一歲，已是有了兩個孩子的爹爹了。在戰前他攻讀於河北工學院，戰後才讀究了師大，畢業後　在天津工學院担任機械製岡敎授，從他的外表上，雖然瞧不出十分魁偉的體格，可是你決不會想到他竟是一個具有性近於機械的精密頭腦脚色。</p>
<p>過去他說很喜歡跳高，也常打打籃球，他的跳高曾以一米六五的成績奪到過河北首屆全運的冠軍，但打籃球又使他的右腿受了傷，這樣才使他對鉛球·鐵餅發生了興趣，他說：「我是個極喜愛運動的人，所以從跳高·籃球·轉到鉛球·鐵餅，也完全是被動的。」這時候，記者就和他笑說；「現在你的鐵餅旣已打破了全國記錄，那末你是否想主動的再努力下去，以備在世運會　爲臘團爭一點榮譽呢？」他連連的說：「不敢，不敢！」雖然還是他的謙遜，但我相信是有無數的人正如記者所期望於他的一樣。</p>
<p>從他的談話衷，使記者知這他還有一個幸福的家庭，他的夫人和他同鄕，曾卒業於河北師範學校，記者很想知道他的喜歡運動，是不是還有他太太的鼓勵成份在，於是我就提出：「你太太是不是也歡喜運動？」他回答得很含糊：「不太歡喜！」</p>
<p>正在談話的時候，有別報記者來請他簽名，他寫得一手好鋼筆字，不過我看到他的「林」字上面沒有雨字頭，就問他究竟是個什麼字，他說那是報名的時候，給別人加上的，天空裏這時候正在飄着小雨，大家笑着說，這下子可眞要給雨淋着了！（育）</p>

<h3 id="c95">男籃錦標誰屬？　上海隊如能加強合作　冠軍一席或不致落空 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　儲裕生</p>
<p>男子籃球今日起開始決賽，決賽採單循環制每勝一次得二分，積分最多者得坐於冠軍之寳座，次多者爲亞軍，再次爲季軍，全負者為殿軍，故此冠，亞，季，殿四軍誰屬？當爲球迷及讀者所最爲關心的了。</p>
<p>論籃球的勝負，當在全隊的按術平均都在水準以上，合作團結的精神充分發揮利用，能够持久忍耐，氣力充沛，射籃準確等。新近奪得決賽權的四隊，如上海·菲僑·聯勤·警察·都貝備着以上各個條件，所以一時實在不能妄加判斷，不過我們連日參觀他們作戰的經過，自有很多地方可以拿來作爲參考的。</p>
<p>先談上海隊，上海隊各個人的個人技術都差不多到了爐火純青的境地，射籃之準確，無出其有。該隊又能運用謀略，沉着應戰，輔以他們所熟習的嶄新戰術，自有奪標的雄心。不過他們有時會忽略於團結合作的精神，在土海戰西貢這一塲，簡直是個人技術的表演，在上海戰海軍這一塲，也不能發揮合作精神至飽和點。故上海與聯勤之戰與菲島之戰，如合作精神欠佳，前途不能樂觀</p>
<p>至於聯勤隊，該隊氣力充沛，爲四隊中最能持久者，打法爲北派，合作精神尙好，惟入日與天津之戰，射籃實太欠準確。且士選志吉每易深入敵陣，如遇上海隊之引敵深入，再切入獲分之打法，則聯勤將大吃其虧。聯勤有時過於緊張，惟其迅捷的打法可謂無出其右，與上海之戰，聯勤倘能穩固後方，加以前綫伙攻，則或能稍有成就，否則一經疏渭，敗北堪膚，對菲島之戰，聯勤當仍採迅攻，惟不能過於慌張。對警察之戰，也不可過於大意。</p>
<p>菲僑隊善用新的戰術戰略，渠等合作精神也尙好，該隊唯一之缺點，即缺乏一中鋒之人才。故其與上海之爭，恐非理想中之順利與聯勤之戰，尤須提防其强硬之切入與距進，對警察之戰不能輕敵。</p>
<p>警察隊實爲四隊中之後起之秀，技術平均，射籃亦準，惟因年事稍青，每易在失分多時過於緊張，故對上海，聯勤，菲島，必須小心應付。</p>
<p>奪覇戰中，塲地的關係很大，如打慣室外不慣打室內，打慣室內不慣打室外。現四隊比賽均在室內，室內者所謂「地板功夫」，觀乎四隊之戰績，「地板功夫」嚴佳當推上海，其次菲島與警察，再次爲聯動，故也可依此來看出一些關鍵。</p>
<p>記者以爲上海隊如加强其合作精神，則或可獲得冠軍，聯勤隊射籃準確度如仍與九日無異。首戰或將負於上海，則聯勤興菲島　取亞軍。但事有出　意料者，倘使警察特別用心努力也可有亞軍之望，聯勤如能充分運用新的戰略戰術，未始不可奪取錦標，菲島如能改進其中　軟弱之缺點，當也可以進入第一名的位置。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕男排循環賽今日開始，深得好評之廣州隊將於今日上午遭遇其勁敵香港隊，預料必有猛烈搏鬥。又昨日男排落選賽結果如下：新疆以直落三大勝河南，每局分數爲：廿一比十七，廿一比十四，廿一比十八；吉林克海軍，亦爲三對零，每局分數爲：廿一比八，廿一比八，廿一比十。湖南則因陸軍棄權而獲勝。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕女子排球滬·台·湘·穗四隊，昨開始循環賽，滬湘兩隊均以直落二奏凱各得二分。滬台之役，精采萬分·戰情如后：</p>
<p>滬各女將力挫臺灣</p>
<p>上海隊因擁有健將陳梅貞·黃明媛等，非台灣隊所能抵禦；而陳梅貞個子旣高，殺球又猛，乃得居高臨下，使對方無從鎖網；但合隊各員防守稱職，連絡頗佳，全隊平均發展，照理不致任憑挨打，所惜者，台隊各員對勝敗得失，看得過分嚴重，而不克沉着應戰，偶有失誤，輙互有指責，以致一敗即慌，而一誤再誤；連賽兩局，均負於滬隊。</p>
<p>首局開始，滬隊發球得分，合隊立即還以顏色，雙方激戰至儿分平手，尙看不出滬隊有壓倒之優勢，惟到十四平分後，台隊因感陳　貞之壓力，軍心慌亂，貽誤頗多，以致在十四分以後，竟一籌莫展，喪失第一局。　次局開始，台灣失去信心，滬隊前中兩排乘機大事殺扣，乃藉廿一比十之輝煌戰果，壓倒臺灣。兩隊陣容附后二：</p>

<p>前度擊敗浙江隊之湘省女兒軍，昨以絕對壓倒之優勢，擊潰廣州隊。</p>
<p>湘隊陳培坤殺得精采，足與上海之陳梅貞嫡美。</p>
<p>廣州隊員體力及作戰技術均差，前次遭遇河南之役，勝來即已極吃力，此次適逢湖南鐵軍，自然無法抗拒，因此，在第一局之始，湘隊連得十三分時，穗方尙是一紙白卷，最後湘隊以廿一比三之懸殊，輕取首局。第二局中穗隊雖傾其全力反攻，倖得十九平乎，終仍棄守。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨夕市體育館拳擊，原定中丙級複賽二塲，因廣東許大偉傷足，臨時宣佈棄權，故僅餘黎東芬（港）與楊金來（粵）之戰，又因粵方認黎東芬　報體重，堅持當塲過秤，遂成僵局，糾繼幾達一小時，主持人竭力斡旋，始勉强解決。比賽於八時三刻開始，黎東芬體格雖較魁梧，惟不若楊金來矯捷如游龍，故着着居於下風，第二回合，被擊倒者凡四次，雖撑持到底，終以積點不及楊金來，被判敗績。楊氏將於後日（十二）晚與上海李愷決中丙級冠軍。</p>

<p>觀衆衝破爾道防綫</p>
<p>憲警童軍滿頭大汗</p>
<p>昨日星期，日蝕後的天氣半陰半晴，前來觀光運動會者，多得無可勝數，遠超過大會第一日，這時才眞的看到「人山人海」。</p>
<p>上午十一時全塲均吿客滿，塲外觀衆麕集，雖由軍警阻擋入內，但至十一時四十分，二處入口均被衝破防綫，潮湧入塲，繼由軍警及童子軍再築第二道防綫，阻止觀衆進入跑道，但未幾又被衝破，秩序大亂。</p>
<p>每一個看台上的出入口附近，人潮洶湧，你推我擠，亂得不可開交，到後來人潮又衝下攔杆，越過竹籬，甚至竄到田徑塲裏，比賽因此曾宣告停止進行者兩次。憲兵，飛行堡壘，童子軍，累得滿頭大汗。</p>
<p>廣播器裏一刻兒說：「觀衆不退出塲子，立刻停止比賽」，一刻兒又拼命打招呼，如此軟硬兼施，觀衆逐漸退出塲子，這才收到了一點小效果。</p>
<p>想起第六屆全運會時，當時的陳　君也被噓出場子的那種秩序，眞使人感慨中國人連這一點也已經退了步。</p>
<p>天公不作美，五時左右又落起雨來，時疏時密，白報紙全當了雨帽，塲外投機家發售小紙傘，每頂竟喊價十三萬元。</p>
<p>河南摔角隊領隊沈溪淸，爲了大會不准他們參加摔角，憤然向四周觀衆演說：「我們號布早已領到，但名單上却沒有我們的各字，我們要從開對趕來做什麼」？最後，他要求大會最低限度允許河南選手和各組冠軍作表演賽一次。　今日會塲裏有兩人昏厥：一個老頭兒腹部被壓在欄杆上，幾乎喪命。（育）</p>

<p>一週經濟　中國工商協會主編</p>
<h3 id="c106">一股物價　直綫上升波濤洶涌　週期性漲風又開始 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>本年一般物價，自三月份第二週陰曆年關後，曾一度掀起漲風，以後轉趨沉寂，迄四月杪，始終在此種穩定狀態下，盤旋前進。但月來銀根鬆弛，暗息低于落，市塲險象叢生，新漲風本有一觸即發之勢，惟由於美貸之漸趨實現，短期國庫券發行在即，多方不無顧忌，以致現欲漲又止之狀。及至上週國庫券業已問世，但收効並不理想，美援雖已發展至相當階段，但物資之到來，亦尙有待，於是一般物價，在此早已成熟之環境下，遂打破月來之沉寂狀態，幾呈直綫上升之勢。自週初以至週末，波濤洶湧，堅挺異當，顯示又一週期性之新漲風，業已開始。就本刊所編上週批發物價總指數觀之，計上升百分之九·二一。（本刊所編指數，因時間關係，取材截至週四爲止，對於週五六之物價波動部份，未能完全表示。）上週物價新漲風，係金融性商品領導於前，貨物市塲追隨於後，相互拉抬，市價逐步叫高。銀根仍甚鬆弛，除週末略緊外，國行交換，差進無多，週三反差出一千五百餘億，暗息徘徊於二角四分至二角七分之間。造成此次物價漲風之因素極多，茲就較主要者，略加分析如次二：</p>
<p>第一，自貝祖詒氏由美返國後，開放外滙傳說，甚囂塵上。因現行外滙政策，旣不能刺激出口，又無力供給進口，其不合時宜，實早有易轍必要。茲値美貸成功，故一般意見，認爲改革時機已至。若一旦外滙開放，則今後政府對工商界所需外滙頭寸，即如目前些微之數，亦將不再供給，勢須自己在市塲上，另行設法。以此美鈔將有求多供少之勢，消息利多，趨勢看漲與此有密切關係的黃金·股票以至其他物價，亦均追隨上升。及至週四，當局雖鄭重否認開放外滙，但燎原之勢已成，無法即時阻止。</p>
<p>第二，民食調配委員會宣佈五月份戶口米配價提高。按四月份戶口米配量爲十五斤六兩，價十一萬元，五月份配量减爲十五斤，價提高爲三十五萬元。市塲米價，平疲已久，乘機上升。此外產地米價頻頻報漲亦爲刺激滬市米價上漲之主要原因。如無錫白粳　前週末之四百一十五萬步漲至週五之五百廿五萬六千。蕪湖米市自週二至週四之三問，每石普漲六七十萬，週四特機達三百六十萬，毛熟四百三十萬，凈糙三百九十萬。</p>
<p>第三，游資無正當出路。月來由於證交遞延交割停做，國庫撥付各種到期價券，支出浩繁，東北華北資金不斷南流等因素之影響，致滬上游資充斥異常，觀乎國行交換情形，迭有差出，暗息始終在低檔徘徊，可以見之。據佔計最近滬上游資，爲數當在十萬億以上。國行所特爲吸收資金的重要工具短期國庫券業已問世，但國庫券定期最短亦在一月，以發行日之掛脾八七·三折扣加月息五分計之，合共不渦月息二角。週二雖提高爲八四·五折，合息金計之，亦不過月息二角四分，對於市塲資金，甚少控制滬力，反使投機者心目中，一　前此戒懼之念，於是大量游資逐奔赴金融及貨品市塲，造成漲風。</p>
<p>第四，月來工廠南遷，資金南流，日甚一日，日前華南方面，廣州並無適當之工商業、足資投放，唯一逃避之地，厥爲香港，形成迫切需求港幣之畸形發展。因此港匯一再猛縮，計日前週末法幣百萬元合港匯六元七角的行盤縮至上週五的四元八角。港匯旣如此猛縮，滬上金鈔及一般金融性商品，亦如影之隨形，齊步飛漲。關於中港間經濟問題，不合理現象層出不窮，日前情形已走入如此嚴重階段，當　宣不應再事因循，亟須速謀妥當對策</p>
<p>第五，滬上物價，平穩已有相常時日，銀根始終鬆濫，國行無力抽緊，兼之各主管機關公佈之四月份職工及公敎人員生活費指數，均見上升。同時國大閉幕，多數代表乘機蒞滬，全國運動會又於此時開幕，各地選手　集滬上，消費不無增加，種種直接問接原因，錯綜複雜，不勝列舉，致形成此次物價必然的大漲風。</p>
<p>上週各項有關物價之新措施可得而述者有：第一，外匯牌價久未調整與黑市匯價，相差過於縣殊。　　二進　請　進　許可證後即可按照當時牌價結匯，但進口貨到達後，　價北非按照匯率成本計算，爲消滅此種不合理現象起見，規定進　商於接到允　進口許可證通知時，即按照當時牌價匯率折合國幣先繳百分之五十保證金，待貨物到達時，再按　時脾價結匯。此項措施，就日前己陷　局之外匯政策言之，仍不脫頭　　頭脚痛醫脚之辦法。</p>
<p>第二，關於美援問題之發展，行政院於週二院會通過，決定設立美援運用委員會，由行政院長主持，設委員十三人，並由主任委員指定三人爲常務委員，協助主特會務，另設正副秘書長各一人，負責處理車務。聞將來各項美援物資之分發，十部　仍將通渦配給方式處理之。</p>
<p>第三，上週滬穗津漢四地金融管理局長聯袂晋京，間對財政當局，有取消內匯限制，放寬管制之建議，能否付諸實施，吾人可待事實證明。</p>
<p>上週物價走勢左前述各種利多因素刺激下，市勢　勃挺秀，多創空前高價。</p>
<p>華股市塲，股王永紗曾破三千元關，景福，信誼，商務等多種，亦均迭登漲限，洋股　勢，較華股有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>紗布方面，因圈外物價高漲，兼之市塲謠傳，紡建存底無多，漲勢呈直綫上升，如四十二支監風前週末收市爲二億四千二百萬，上週末破三億大關，廿一支雙馬亦由前週末之一億　千七百萬漲至上週五之二億一千萬。　頭細布亦追踪上升，週五站六百三十二萬高峯。</p>
<p>糧食因民調會配價提一高，產價報漲等關係，南北兩市塲上白粳價，一週來均普　約八九十萬，雜糧食油，自亦連　上升。麵粉因北銷旺盛，如兵船一號粉由前週末之一百四十二萬漲至週末之一百八十萬。食糧因時令關係，銷路較暢，且台幣匯率迎續調整，計台幣一元五角合法幣二七八元，六日爲二八八元，七日爲三〇二元，如車白精糖於週末已出千元大關，其他如日用品，化學品，建築材料等，均無不上升，造成鉅大之波動幅度。</p>

<p>（一）銀根與遊資</p>
<p>上週本市銀根，仍　前迴走勢，呈現十分鬆濫局面。五月物價漲風，至爲猛烈，金融性物品更見瘋狂上漲各方需單雖甚殷切，但以遊資匯集，供源吒盛，銀根鬆勢，一時尙無收歛跡象。市塲晴息，上週週一在二角四分與二角五分半之間，週三週四，雖一度高見二角七分以至二角八分半，但週五又低見二角四分，可見頭寸寬裕之一般。據報載某金融業人士談稱，本市遊資存底甚爲豐厚，非正式估計達十萬億元之鉅。游資所以如此泛濫，據說係受下列諸原因影響：</p>
<p>（一）各地農貸紛紛流入都市，本市現鈔籌碼，因之充裕異常。（二）行局支出浩繁。（三）短期國庫券人民承購者寥寥，而當局尙無有效抽緊銀根方法。（四）廿七，廿九暨卅一年美金公債抵達還本付息之期。（五）國大代表及各地運動選手來滬，不免增加一部份額外購買力。（六）金鈔黑市所以瘋在上漲，據報制係某某巨公競購所致。</p>
<p>暗息的欲昂乏力，固足以說明銀根鬆勢，尙須維持一個時期，國庫支出浩繁，也可在國家行局的交換差額中看出。自週一至週五國家行局雖因糖紗等價款收入，表現爲八千四百二十八億的差進，但這數目中尙包括商業銀行於國行的大筆定存，故扣除以後，國家行局幾乎每天有眞實差出，五天內差出之凈額尙達一萬零七十二億，市塲頭寸寬裕，受其影響不少。　行莊方面，單子現鈔均感鬆裕異常，同業拆放幾瀕停頓，每天解繳國行之現鈔亦在五六百億以上，可知現鈔籌碼存底之豐厚。六十號以後行疪交換結果，自週一至週五，差出共達六千九百多億其間還包括週五二百二十億的着進：</p>
<p>洋商銀行交換結果，週三着進額又創空前記錄，達三千二百七十八億，週五差出七百廿二億亦爲二月來所罕有，總計五天內共差進四千八百三十　億，較前週减進頗多。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外滙行市，基準率掛牌未動，港滙則猛縮，週一香港十萬法幣合港幣六角七分，但週五已縮至四角八分，計縮短三分之一，彼動堪稱劇烈。又香港美滙期票以週一之五元六角九分爲最高，週五之五元五角三分爲最低。美鈔市價週一合港幣五元六角，週五亦縮至五元四角四分，黃金每華兩週一爲三三三元，週四遞縮至三二九元，但週五突提升至三四〇元。</p>
<p>上週內滙行情，廣州滙永逐有提高，週一爲八十元，週五已遞升至一百四十元，厦門滙水走勢大致相同，週一爲一百元，週二雖一度减爲八十元，但後即　升，至週五已達一百二十元，反映資金再趨南流之趨勢。渝滙週一爲平滙，週二改爲貼水十元，週三至週五貼水皆爲二十元。漢口滙水亦見上升，週一爲平滙，過五亦已升至四十元，津滙週內無變動，維持於五十元貼水之水準。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>本週開始，港滙又報緊縮，外灑開放之說，傳將實行。對於股市，顯見有利，人心感奮，永紗首先挺進，創見二三二五元新高價，他股隨同堅俏，美亞四二五〇，統益六二一，華豐七二，均達漲限。週二因游資湧集，銀根鬆濫，再趨挺升，永紗叩二千五百大關，各股全程皆見穩步上揚，華豐再達漲限，以八六·四收市，中泥九二〇，恒豐四七一·五，亦屆漲停。週三忽傳東北流通券入關兌換，永紗益露鋒鋩，一度創二六五〇新高價，獨呈秀色，成交額亦最盛，他股情形盤旋。週四股市，如火如荼，多頭氣勢，愈見磅礴，竟吿滿堂紅，永紗越三千八百關，景綸　　等十五種，均　漲限。成交劇增，達八億俗。經四日來之不斷漲，待　週五，銀根仍呈鬆勢永紗一鼓作氣，竄出三千大關，創三〇二五新高峯。舊多逢高，終　　利了結。檯面頓呈　張，突然暴瀉，激降至二八三〇元，以當日最低價收市。其他各股，亦紛紛　動挫跌。</p>
<p>洋股因港匯再縮縮，及金融性物品飛漲，怡紗漲達三九三萬元，英聯四三〇萬元，會德　爲八一〇萬元，均較前　升。週二因金融性商品黑市狂昇，洋股亦見直綫　漲，會德豐較前勁漲達七千萬元，怡紗英聯各升三四十萬。其他如啤酒八十八萬，航業四六萬，業廣九三萬，無不上漲。週三港滙再縮，漲勢益見銳厲，會德豐再漲八十萬元，竟喊九六〇萬元，瀕近千萬關。英聯五〇〇萬元，怡紗四四四萬元。週四港滙連縮不已，因洋股以港爲票面數額單位，　致洋股續見猛漲，怡紗見四七八萬元之高價，英聯五八〇萬元，會德豐直抵一千萬元大關。週五再登高峯，怡紗曾升見五一五萬元，旋聞華股挫跌，回降至五〇六萬元；英聯六〇五萬元，會德豐穿越千萬大關，狂升至一一八○萬元。嗥酒喊一〇四萬，業廣一一五萬元，航業五二萬，均較上日挺升。</p>
<p>紗布南銷多打擊　前途仍難抱樂觀</p>
<p>紗布南運雖已開放，但各項紡織品南銷成績，北未若何良好。據紗布染織業表示，自本市紗布南運解禁以後，該業人士均思趕運大批紗布南運，企圖獲利，但邇來港澳市况不振，雖未倒掛，但如由滬運往，加上運費，水脚，關稅，以及拆息，人工等各項開支後，不特未能獲利，且反須虧折。故除過去已接受定金者外，新交易絕少承做，且香港新設紡織染織廠家日多，產銷日增，就地運銷，予滬紗布南銷以巨大打擊。至暹羅，菲律賓，馬尼刺等各地，紗布市堪雖尙佳，但日紗競銷頗烈，吾國紗布南銷，前途難以樂觀。</p>

<h3 id="c108">過敏性氣喘之新療法 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 來厚均</p>
<p>前次拜讀醫師「氣喘病療法」後，竊以近年來過敏性支氣管喘息（Allergic　Bronchial　Asshma）病人甚多；歐美各先進國家，對過敏性疾病，經年來努力研究結果；對於過敏性喘息之根治療法，已有良好成績，而用特殊敏感療法（Specific　desensitization　therapy）以根治喘息；在我國尚未普遍。復以友人再三敦促，囑就學習所得；用各種過敏原（Allergen）作特殊脫敏感療法。爲文公諸社會。庶幾拋磚引玉，冀得海內高明指敎；抑可使患此病者，對本病有深切療解；知本病並非如以往認爲不治之　疾。</p>
<p>過敏性支氣管喘息原因</p>
<p>即患者對於一種或多種物質，呈特異過敏性，當此種過敏原進人人體後，使網狀內皮系統，產生一種敏感性抗體（Sensitizing　Antibady），與過敏原結合而產生類組織按物質（Histaminelike　Substance）；遂生喘息症。</p>
<p>過敏原來源可分兩類：</p>
<p>（一）體內產生之過敏原</p>
<p>例如扁桃腺腫，副鼻竇炎，慢性支氣管炎等。病原菌所分泌毒索。</p>
<p>（二）外來因素</p>
<p>甲：空內灰塵，空氣微菌，花粉等。</p>
<p>乙：動物頭屑，毛髪，及其分泌物等。</p>
<p>內；各種食物。</p>
<p>其中尤以甲類最爲重要。　爲每一忠者之過敏因素。曾見多數忠者，於堆滿灰塵及　氣濃厚之處，逗留片刻，即能引起連續之噴　。—喘息先驅症。</p>
<p>食物過敏以幼兒爲多。其過敏性，隨年齡之增長而减退。四，五歲以內幼兒，患者幾全因食物過敏。倘能測知其過敏原，即忌服用；則根治自易。又患食物過敏者，常有濕疹痒疹，及慢性消化不良症。然此不外係皮膚及消化道過敏性之病變。</p>
<p>症狀，梁醫師已詳細論及，茲不重述。</p>
<p>治療</p>
<p>（一）特殊療法（根治療法）</p>
<p>甲·避免法，</p>
<p>此法最爲確實，苟能完全避免與過敏原接觸，可不致復發。數年後，對該項過敏原之敏感性，即可减退。</p>
<p>對於塵埃，花粉，吸入呼吸道，致生過敏的患者；可用美國出品之電氣除塵器；抽去室內灰塵。則喘息可於十分鐘內完全制止。又有用特製之口罩，能濾過空氣中之過敏原；此罩於工作或睡眠中均可使用。</p>
<p>病者寢室：宜高爽，陽光充足。傢具應簡單，淸潔；枕褥內宜襯以橡皮布，使灰塵不外揚。室內不宜留有動物及昆虫。</p>
<p>乙，特殊脫敏感療法</p>
<p>此法在歐美，於五十年前，已經採用。祗以提取過敏原之方法，不甚精確；故效果不如理想之佳。自一九三六年以後。美國硏究此病專家，年有貢獻；病理上亦有發明；故用脫敏感療法，治療過敏性疾病，亦若盤尼西林之用於化膿性疾病而被普遍採用矣。</p>
<p>其法：用各種過敏原，先作皮內試騐，以測知病人對於某幾種過敏原，有反應。此後，即用各該項過敏原，作脫敏感療法。至於技術問題。須有相當經騐。否則反能促其發病也。此種療法，需經相當時間，大約半年至一年後，即有美滿之效果。</p>
<p>一般人以爲過敏原種類甚多，勢難加以試騐。實則亦有幾條原州則可循。最普通過敏原，亦不過六七十種。而每一患者之過敏原，則祗四五種。並不如理想之繁難。惟尚需作各種化驗檢查，以助治療。</p>
<p>其由於上呼吸氣道內之局部病灶，而致喘息者，則川外科手術；同時用疫苗注射，以治療之。</p>
<p>（二）對症療法</p>
<p>亦頗重要。不獨在發作時可减輕病人痛苦，及縮短其過程。亦爲根治期中之重要協助，不過各種藥物，皆有其副作用。量小則不效，過量又有害。惟憑醫師因人對症用藥耳。故不具論。</p>
<p>新興抗組織按藥物（Antihisatminics）</p>
<p>例如　Benaohyl，Pyribenzamine,Thiodiphenyl，amine　derivaives等等。惟此類藥物，尚在試用期中，效能甚暫，且有相當副作用。但歷經專家們不斷的硏究與改革；想不久的將來，必有滿意之效能也。</p>
<p>轉地療養</p>
<p>病人移居山地，極爲相宜。</p>

<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>月前讀到本刊六十期，工完白氏的大作；「農村之敵鉤虫病」後，很感興趣，因在下現於蘇南地方病防治所香山衛生實驗區任醫師，這裏爲著名的日本住血吸虫病流行區。日前我們檢查各校兒童的健康狀况，發見有病的竟達百分之七十弱；其他並不是個個身體强壯，大都營養不良，發育不健。疾病大都爲腹痛，血便，附帶砂眼，口腔炎，中耳炎，齲齒，皮膚病……要是全國各校兒童大都這樣在帶病上學，朱來國家主人翁，都如此不健，中華民國還有什麼前途！</p>
<p>據去年本區檢驗學齡兒童一八四人的糞便，竟有一四四人患腸寄生腸病，包括日本住血吸虫，薑片虫，蛔虫，鈎虫，鞭虫等。因學生的父母業農，大都不知衛生，口渴飲生水，義成了習慣，一切汚物都往河中拋，便桶在河中洗，用水也在河中取；已有腸寄生虫病人的地方，腸寄生虫病，自即盛行。本來腸寄生虫病並不嚴重，驅虫療法合理，病體即可解脫；回復健康；祗有日本住血吸虫病，才是今日眞正農村的大敵。因一經感染，現代尚無特效藥，注Fuacin只可殺滅牠的雄虫，雌虫絲毫不受應響。只能使病勢暫止，不能使病體霍然而愈。至百分之二酒石　鉀溶液，起用半西西注靜脈，逐日加半西西，到第十日用五西西而止。在本病肝脾腫大後，不但無效，且有致命危險。</p>
<p>鉤虫，原名：Anchylostomiasis，即十二指腸虫，口生四鈎齒，咬着腸粘膜，取宿主營養素爲生，並不如王氏所謂：「吸食人血」。如果直接吸食人血，牠們在人的肝，肺，等內臟內，到處可生存，試想鉤虫病人還有什麼生路？循環器及肺，肝等，僅是牠們侵入的徑路，小腸才是牠們的生長地。因牠們須賴小腸內的營養份爲生，其虫卵雖小，究不若細菌之小，所以在顯微鏡下百餘倍，即可淸楚瞧到：橢圓形的虫卵，壳薄無色，內有四個卵細菌。如迎接如一雙啞鈴狀，也有變形的，僅二個卵細胞。本病患者爪甲淡紅，或蒼白黃色，菲薄脆弱，尖端易裂，且表面凹凸不平，向指背翻轉，爲其特徵。患者嗜異物。本病愈後，大都正常。驅虫愈早，恢復愈速。但到末期，浮腫及出血傾向時，則驅虫藥難以使用，愈後也往往不良。</p>
<p>合理的驅虫療法：（自須先檢騐大便）</p>
<p>（一）臨睡頓服Mag　Sulfuric　20.0</p>

<p>預後</p>
<p>過敏原測出後，即應完全避免接觸。幷用特殊脫敏感療法，成效甚著。大多數病人，皆可完全根治。</p>
<p>據最近美國醫學雜誌上記載：美國醫院病人統計結果，過敏性疾病約佔20％—30％。多發生於幼年，或先患濕疹，痒疹，再生喘息。幼年患者，又多因母乳不足，佐以奶榚，另加食糖喂養者。比種未經完全消化之蛋白質，及多糖類分子。可進人幼兒發育未全之腸壁，產生過敏症，且使腸壁變性（Degeneration）；此後對於食物易呈敏感性。故嬰孩在六個月以啊前，切忌給予堅硬食物。應以人乳為主要食品，否則亦宜代以牛乳。勿爲節儉金錢，而遺嬰孩以疾病也。</p>

<p>— 季用</p>
<p>中國人在作文章的時候，頭腦很清晰而複雜，臂如欲擒先　，烘雲托月，欲坤先　，背面傅粉等法則，眞是「古已有之」，而且運用的十分圓熟漂亮，所以留給我們後人那麽多擲地作金石聲的佳作，可惜是，能說者未必能行，特別在用錢一事，好像完全不懂方法。</p>
<p>其實文章作得不通，還不要緊，至少不會有殺身之禍；至於用錢，可就有許多麻煩與問題了。原因是錢乃人人要用之物，會用的人，不但自己得其所哉，別人也不竿因你而枯竭，也便是日本鬼子常說的「共存共榮；」不會用的人，表面看起來自己很享受，但每一種享受都使另外一部分人剝奪一些生機，積之旣久，一定會變爲莫大的仇恨，這便是一切動亂與不安的最大來源。</p>
<p>儒家只給人極籠統的敎訓，說什麽「君子喩于義，小人喩于利，」於是「子罕言利，」而孟子且因此面斥梁惠王。事實上利怎麼可以罕言，養又怎麼喩法？這不完全是空心湯　嗎？讀這種敎訓多了，一定會把人變成偽君子，表面上口不言錢，骨子裏見錢就　，我翁今日的食官汚吏，全會講一套仁養大道，恐怕都是孔孟的敎條訓出來的。至於道家，那更糟，他們只知道錢是萬惡淵蔽，主張「不見可欲，使心不亂，」又說「五色令人目盲，五聲令人耳聾，五味令人口爽，」這好比「此地無銀五十兩，」越說越偷的厲害。社會旣已有了錢，而且錢可以買到一切，除非全世界對錢都有澈底的革命，否則你想阿Ｑ式的否定他的存在，那是一百個不成功的。</p>
<p>但懦家却有「蝮蛇蟄手壯士斷腕」的訓條，去一肢以存全體，衡量得失，到底値得，雖然身體髪膚，受之父母，不敢毀傷，到這時候也講不了許多了。身體且是如此，用錢何獨不然？中國人——特別是有錢的中國人，很少想到這一層，有時候，爲了自己姨太太的病，或是本身的梅毒與糖尿症，兒子的天花與傷寒，許下願心，到冬天捨棉衣若干套，或便宜了和尚道士，作個全堂水陸道塲，好像是大慈大悲阿彌陀佛之至，但他姨太太及少爺乃至他本身的生老病死，並不權操他人，如果天老爺也巴結闊人，偏偏不給他生病，窮人莫非等着凍死餓死？所以即以自私自利而論，這已落於最下乘，何况大多數人，迎這麽一點施捨，也會在「打破迷信」的口號下藉題取消呢？有個朋友曾作一比喩，他說譬如有五杯茶，十個人都口乾舌燥想要吃，自然是捷足先登，有力者搶到，在外國，可能有一個人吃兩杯，其餘三盃分給九個人，三人一杯，雖不解渴，亦可生津，而中國則不然，一個人連吃三杯，其餘的我雖不吃，別人也不要，倒在地下，變成泥漿！這比喩我以爲很恰當，試以上海一隅而論，每天把乾乾凈凈的水倒在地下變泥漿的不知有多少，而大多數人在那裏渴得七竅生烟，卻毫不顧問，試問這樣能夠長久嗎？</p>
<p>我們曾看見過美國的煤油大王鋼鐵大王對於社會事業一　千萬，毫無吝色，中國人必定有很多人在暗暗　他們傻瓜，「如果我有這麽多錢，才不這樣幹呢！」可是事實上洛克費勒和迦內蔡家族却絕未曾因這些施捨而日就困窮，反之，他們的事業與安全更因是得到牢不可破的保障，這就是歐美人比我們會用錢的表現。須知一國之內，如其所謂豪門大族，都能有這般遠大眼光，若干憂患，就再滅於無形，革命興流血，都無所用之了。我總覺得革命是人類萬不得已而出之的一種手段，即革命者本身，也不會引此爲榮，爲什麽在別的國家可以用社會政策代　社會革命，而中國不能呢？此事要有錢的人三思。</p>
<p>幼時讀陶淵明與子儼等疏，敎訓他兒子好好待僕人，「此亦人子也，宜善遇之」，一似此老大可佩服。今日思之，中國家庭蓋以虐待用人爲原則，視僕人如「人」爲例外，由陶公之言，才反襯出全部知識分子之混蛋！蓋全世界固絕無規定「僕人必須不以人相待」之訓條者，則陶公之疏，豈足道哉！然而今日之富人，方以捨幾件棉衣爲功德，却忘記此乃千眞萬確之自私自利。若連這種自私亦不能深明大道，作得要有效更深刻，則其及身嘗試悲劇，豈不宜哉！</p>

<p>運動塲中各地選手在旗幟繽紛之間，有規律地分成兩翼退出了，塲上頓時一空，只剩得正對司令台遙遠的前面有一羣上海市的中學生。有多少人，也數不淸；男的，女的，也看不淸。望過去，只見頭上戴的盡是白帽，上身穿的盡是白襯衫，下身繫的盡是藍短褲，脚上著的盡是白帆布鞋。白，藍，白，全體一色，無有例外。他們躱在廣塲上的角落裏，好像在靜待著什麼。</p>
<p>忽然司令台上一聲令下那時壯麗的增面展開了。不疾不徐，亦整亦齊，萬腿齊舉，移步前進，前進，直進至司令台前，一大片廣塲上，頓時布滿了不知多多少少的有活力的靑年們。他們行進時，說像潮湧，不像，因潮起時後浪推前浪，並沒有那麽輕疾，只是洶湧。他們站定時，說　星羅棋布，也不像，因爲星的羅和棋的布，又怎有那麼整齊而有規律？勉强形容，只好說像一幅有圖案的藍白相間的大地毯在塲上慢慢展開，至舖滿爲止。</p>
<p>樂聲響了，大會操開始了。白帽，白鞋，白襯衫和藍短褲，彷彿有靈魂似的，會得隨著音樂的旋律，不約而同地動起來，動得輕妙，動得整　。此時看台上的人頭不在蠕蠕動了，被那場上萬手齊舉，白帽上伸出了一段段的紅藕，耀得人有些眼花！一忽兒萬掌齊擊，其聲又好像有千萬匹帛在同時撕裂，發出那麽淸脆的一聲來！一忽兒俯下身子，隨著樂聲的抑揚，一起一伏，又耀得人眼花。這倒可以比仿，那廣塲是一片大海此時正風和日晴，那一起一伏的則　海上輕波，而且只能說是輕波，不是濁浪！</p>
<p>樂聲抑揚疾徐，動作周旋中節，忽然樂停，塲上站住了不可數計的白帽，白鞋，白襯衫和藍短褲的一羣有活力的靑年們；於是看台上觀衆都透了一口氣，接著蠕蠕而動，四周掌聲如春雷之四動，即使你有萬鈞之力，要過也遏不住下來，我感動得要淚下了！</p>

<p>有一個機會，最近去參觀了幾位靑年朋友努力支持着的一所民衆義務夜校。說老實話，我最不贊成參觀之類的舉動，因爲當參觀的時候，不但被參觀的覺得侷促不安，就是被行政長官主任幹事等牽着走的參觀者，也覺得侵犯了他人自然的生活而有所抱愧；何况走篤看花地巡視一周，除了厠所的淸潔和牆上的圖表能够一目瞭然外，其他的結果是很難得到的，照例只是「很好」「謝謝」一陣敷衍了事。</p>
<p>我深知這幾位靑年朋友的努力情形，但匆匆地參觀的結果，是無論如何看不出他們努力成績的萬一的，因爲我明白他們還不懂得裝點門面例如呌學生們鞠躬必須九十度等等。但是就只憑這樣膚淺的觀察，我多少見到了這大都市中窮苦人民重男輕女的思想還是頑强地存在着，並且非常牢固。</p>
<p>每個敎室大概有四十個學生，但是我可以保證至少其中有三十多個是女的，這專實說明這一代做家長的依然怎樣歧視着女孩子，至少是並不把她們和他們看作有着同樣受敎育的權利的。我找一個機會倫偸地問一個年紀比較小的女孩子的家庭狀况，她忸怩地告訴我，她的一個弟弟被送進附近的一所小學，而她沒有讀完三年級，便轉到這所養務夜校裏來。我明白做家長的苦衷，這個苦衷，令我驚奇的是連那不過十三四歲的女孩子也似乎很瞭解。她早熟地說：「弟弟讀書是應該的，我能够在夜校裏讀書已是幸運，姊姊像我那樣大時已經進香烟廠了。」</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The National Government has specially promulgated the Temporary Provisions of the Constitution during the Period of National Crisis. The order reads as follows: Order of the National Government: The First National Assembly, in its first session, formulated the Temporary Provisions during the Period of National Crisis in accordance with the procedure of Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, which is hereby promulgated. This order.</p>
<p>Temporary Provisions During the Period of National Crisis</p>
<p>These Temporary Provisions during the Period of National Crisis are formulated in accordance with the procedure of Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution as follows:</p>
<p>During the Period of National Crisis, in order to avoid urgent danger or hardship to the nation or its people, or to cope with major financial and economic changes, the President may, with the resolution of the Executive Yuan Council, take emergency measures without being restricted by the procedures prescribed in Articles 39 or 43 of the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan may amend or repeal the aforementioned emergency measures in accordance with the procedure stipulated in Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution. The termination of the Period of National Crisis shall be announced by the President or upon request by the Legislative Yuan to the President.</p>
<p>The President shall convene a temporary session of the First National Assembly no later than December 25, 1950 (the 39th year of the Republic) to discuss amendments to the Constitution. If the Period of National Crisis has not been terminated as prescribed in the preceding paragraph by that time, the temporary session of the National Assembly shall decide whether the temporary provisions should be extended or repealed.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] As of the 9th, 440 Legislative Yuan members have registered. It is expected that the first preparatory meeting on the 10th will have more than half of the total number of members in attendance. The primary issue will be to decide on the person to chair the preparatory meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] Six Legislative Yuan members from Hubei Province and Wuhan City, including Yu Zheng and Li Jianting, took a bus to Nanjing today to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] Qian Legislative Yuan member Li Juping will fly to Nanjing on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] A person in charge of the Central Party Headquarters stated: The Kuomintang Central Committee has decided to nominate Sun Ke and Chen Lifu as candidates for the positions of President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. Kuomintang Legislative Yuan members must obey the Party's decision, which means assisting in their election. The rumor that Chen Lifu's campaign committee was established on the 8th is purely groundless.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Discussions regarding the issue of elected Legislative Yuan members from the Democratic and Youth Parties continued today, the 9th, with Lei Zhen separately visiting people from both parties for consultations. No concrete conclusion was reached. However, people from both parties will go to Shanghai within the next two days to hold a meeting and make a decision.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mo Dehui has been in contact with the leaders of the Democratic and Youth Parties since yesterday to help resolve the stalemate over the number of Legislative Yuan seats. At noon, Mo was invited to a banquet by Zhang Junmai and went to Fan Garden to discuss the matter for more than two hours. Around 3:00 PM, Li Huang visited Mo at Zhongshan Hospital for a lengthy conversation. Mo kept the content of the meeting secret but stated, "The solution still lies within the Legislative Yuan, not outside it, because Zhang Junmai values the Legislative Yuan the most." He also said, "Just a little effort is needed, and a solution will surely be found."</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in This City] Government Commissioners Mo Dehui and Xu Kan, the Director of the National Government's Budget, came to Shanghai to mediate the issue of the elected Legislative Yuan members from the Democratic and Youth Parties. At noon on the 9th, the two had lunch with Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party. In the afternoon, Li Huang of the Youth Party visited Mo. They held separate consultations on this issue. It is reported that the attitude of both parties is very firm. They are unwilling to consider anything other than half of the Legislative Yuan seats for the two parties, and the other half to be resolved by other means, which has led to this stalemate with no progress.</p>

Hu said that this was a good education in democratic training. All 3,000-plus delegates came from the people. Although the external control that was rumored could not be said to be completely non-existent, it was ineffective because the election was by secret ballot, unlike the National Assembly of the Soviet Union, where 99% were controlled. Hu also said that alumni of Shanghai Great China University have donated 5 billion yuan to rebuild the Jie Min Memorial Hall.</p>

<p>To Be Allocated to Private Factories</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that all Japanese reparations goods will be fully shipped to Shanghai by the middle of this month. As of now, a total of 596 pieces and 517 units of reparations goods for private enterprises, totaling 1,388,069 tons, have been shipped to this city and are stored in the No. 7 Wharf warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong, under the custody of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office. In addition, there are 286 pieces of Japanese reparations goods transported by the "Changli" and 311 pieces of goods transported by the "Limin," which are currently being unloaded. According to the current reparations goods that have arrived, there are no complete sets of equipment, but rather small-scale working machines and engines, which are greatly needed by general industries. Therefore, there are many applicants, with the total exceeding three times the amount of goods that have arrived. In the past, the allocation work was delayed due to the decision on preferential measures for rear-area reconstruction factories. It is now known that the Executive Yuan officially decided on preferential measures yesterday, and it is expected that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' appraisal committee will begin work soon. When the reparations goods arrived, experts from the Allied Headquarters had already provided valuation sheets. However, in order to be cautious, our side will refer to these valuation sheets and re-evaluate the goods based on their quality and age before allocating them to private factories.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Ministry of Interior Cables Provincial Governments to Effectively Handle Conscription; Second Term Enlisted Youth Division to Extend Service by Two Years <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Ministry of Interior recently cabled various provincial governments, stating that according to reports from the Ministry of National Defense, many personnel handling conscription affairs in various regions have failed to comply with laws and regulations to handle matters practically. The central government has detailed and specific regulations regarding conscription matters. If all parties cooperate effectively, especially township officials below the county level, there will definitely be no corruption. At this time of national crisis, the replenishment of soldiers is extremely important. All levels of conscription personnel should abide by regulations and handle matters practically. Those who commit illegal and corrupt acts will be punished according to the law as a warning to others, thereby benefiting conscription.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In order to cultivate and educate military officers, the Reserve Cadre Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has specially stipulated that the second term enlisted youth division across the country will have their service extended by two years. The key points of attention are: (1) To enable all our young officers and soldiers to fully understand the significance of the extended service, increase their enthusiasm for serving, and promptly launch extended service propaganda based on actual needs and timeliness. (2) To emphasize spiritual education, prioritize national consciousness and a sense of responsibility, and second personal gains and losses, in order to establish a theoretical foundation for extended service. (3) The company commander and deputy commanders should have individual talks with outstanding soldiers in their company to increase their understanding and play a exemplary leadership role.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The central government recently summoned Northeast generals to Nanjing and drafted a plan to break the stalemate in the Northeast. The plan has been brought to Beiping by Zhao Jiaxiang and others to exchange views with Fu Zuoyi on relevant issues. After consultations in Shenyang, it can be implemented. Generally, it involves the joint suppression of the communist bandits in eastern Hebei and western Liaoning in North China and the Northeast.

<h3 id="e21">Political Affairs Symposium of Pacification Zones Continues in Nanjing Yesterday; Wang Fenggang Reports on Bandit Suppression in Ji <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Political Affairs Symposium of Pacification Zones continued on the morning of the 9th. Wang Fenggang, Commissioner of the Tenth District of Ji, reported on the bandit suppression situation in the district. Wang explained the coordination and application of the party, government, and military, as well as bandit suppression tactics, based on his bandit suppression experience. The session lasted for three hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The afternoon session was adjourned, and the meeting is scheduled to continue on the morning of the 10th. In the afternoon of the 9th, Wang also went to National Chengchi University at the university's request to report on the recent situation of bandit suppression in the Pingjinbao triangle area.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Wang Fenggang reported on his experience in bandit suppression in the Tenth District and the joint efforts of the military and civilians in annihilating communist bandits at the request of the Ji Youth Progressive Association on the evening of the 9th. Wang first described the various atrocities of the communist bandits in Ji Province, saying that they have aroused the hatred of all the people. He then explained the reasons for the development of the communist bandits in Ji Province, one being that they used guerrilla tactics to gain the initiative, and the other being that our politics could not be coordinated with the military. Everything was done simply by following orders, and politics could not be integrated with the people. Finally, Wang analyzed the bandit suppression measures he took in the Tenth District. On the military side, they did not defend strongholds but adopted guerrilla tactics. On the political side, they absolutely integrated with the people, sharing their joys and sorrows. In the past year, the communist bandits in the six counties of the Tenth District have been eliminated. The Tenth District has a total of 7,000 troops with over 3,500 rifles, but the communist bandits often attacked with a force of 20,000. As a result, they all failed. The people of the Tenth District have all spontaneously mobilized to assist the government in suppressing the communist bandits. When it is absolutely necessary to retreat, they all empty the houses and clear the fields, making it impossible for the bandits to survive in the area. If the people cannot escape, they adopt a non-cooperative attitude, answering "I don't know" to any questions asked by the bandits. Therefore, the communist bandits have never been able to survive in the Tenth District. There are now no traces of bandits in the area.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Warning Sign of Japan's Re-armament! <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The American policy of supporting Japan's reconstruction has advanced from economic assistance to military assistance. The "Maritime Safety Agency," established in Tokyo on May 1st, with Takeo Okubo as its director, and maritime offices set up in Yokosuka, Niigata, Nagoya, and other places, possesses 8,000 armed personnel and 38 security and surveillance ships that patrol Japanese territorial waters in rotation. This is a measure recently specially approved by MacArthur, without going through the Far Eastern Commission and the Control Council for Japan, to revive Japan's naval forces. Although American officials have stated that the Maritime Safety Agency is not actually armed, the Allied Headquarters' measures are too lacking in careful consideration. It will shock the world, causing people to be alarmed, feeling that this is a warning sign of Japan's re-armament!</p>
<p>Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration's unconditional surrender, all armed organizations have been dissolved, and the Ministries of the Army and Navy and the Air Force have also been formally abolished. However, the equipment and machinery of the army and navy have been completely preserved and not disposed of, so they can be rebuilt at any time. In recent years, Japanese underground organizations have been working hard to carry out clandestine activities, attempting to restore their armed forces. Last May, an official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry requested the establishment of an army of 100,000 men after the termination of the Allied occupation, to test the attitude of the Allied countries. At that time, due to the opposition of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the Allied Headquarters informally rejected Japan's request. However, the Allied Headquarters allowed Japan to maintain a small number of armed police, and any other manifestation that could become re-armament would not be considered until a peace treaty was concluded. But only a year has passed since this matter, and the Allied Headquarters has approved the establishment of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency, and it is even heard that MacArthur intends to allow the Agency to expand its armed personnel from 8,000 to 10,000 in the near future, and to increase the strength of its fleet from 38 to 135 ships. This is tantamount to allowing Japan to rebuild its maritime armed forces and gradually prepare to restore the Ministry of the Navy. Whatever the reason for this measure, it is a threat to the Pacific nations, and we should all oppose it and effectively prevent the development of Japan's re-armament.</p>
<p>(1) The establishment of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency is a new threat to the countries along the Pacific coast. The Allied Headquarters' permission for Japan to restore its maritime armed forces this time is based on the reason that it is necessary to take stern action with maritime police to prevent Koreans from illegally entering Japan for smuggling. The Japanese government uses the illegal activities of Koreans as an excuse, and even expands the actions of Osaka City to repel Koreans, in an attempt to increase the strength of the police. In fact, Japan's existing police force is sufficient to prevent smuggling and suppress any activities of Korean smugglers. As far as we know, Koreans do not engage in large-scale smuggling activities in Japanese territorial waters. On the contrary, Japanese smuggling organizations still exist, and smuggling activities have penetrated into Taiwan, Fujian, Hong Kong, and other places. Therefore, Japan's establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency under the pretext of stopping Korean smuggling is a deception, and the real purpose is to rebuild Japan's maritime armed forces and pose a new threat to the Pacific nations.</p>
<p>(2) The reconstruction of Japan's maritime armed forces carries the crisis of the rebuilding of the Japanese navy. The development of this situation is contrary to the spirit of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, and even violates the decision of the Far Eastern Commission on the basic policy towards Japan. The Cairo Declaration of November 22, 1943, stated that "the purpose of the three great Allied Powers in waging this war is to restrain and punish Japan's aggression"; the purpose of restraining Japan's aggression is to disarm it materially and immaterially, and to punish its aggressors who use armed forces, in order to eliminate war and prevent it from occurring in future space and time. The Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, listed "We insist that militarism responsible for the war must be driven from the world; the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated permanently," and "until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed," therefore the Allied countries demanded that the Japanese government "immediately proclaim the unconditional surrender of all armed forces and provide proper guarantees of its good faith in such action." Because the Allied countries wanted to obtain evidence that Japan had destroyed its war-making and disarmament forces, the Control Council for Japan and the Allied Headquarters were established to supervise Japan's implementation of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. Unexpectedly, the Potsdam Declaration has not yet been thoroughly implemented, but the occupying forces have allowed the restoration of Japanese armed forces, which is tantamount to destroying the sacred basis of the Potsdam Declaration. At the meeting of the Control Council for Japan on April 28, the American representative, Mr. Sheppard, submitted the case of the establishment of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency for discussion. Representatives from China, Britain, and the Soviet Union all opposed it. The Soviet representative hoped that the case would be implemented after the decision of the Far Eastern Commission, which is a very reasonable proposal. The Far Eastern Commission is the highest decision-maker for the Allied policy towards Japan. According to the basic policy towards Japan promulgated by the Far Eastern Commission on June 20, 1947, "Disarmament and demilitarization are the initial tasks of military occupation and should be completed quickly and decisively." MacArthur's measure, in not submitting it to the Far Eastern Commission, is because his arbitrariness actually violates the policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>(3) Before a peace treaty with Japan is concluded and the compensation problem is resolved, Japan's use of ships and equipment to rebuild its maritime armed forces will affect the compensation for Allied merchant ships, and may even result in no compensation at all. Among the Pacific coastal countries that fought against Japan, the greatest ship losses were suffered by China, followed by the Philippines, Australia, Britain, and the Netherlands. The United States believes that Japan should have between two and three million tons of merchant ships, while our country believes that half of this is sufficient, and the issue of compensation for merchant ship tonnage has not yet been resolved. Now that Japan has established the Maritime Safety Agency, the warships it holds, each of which is hundreds of tons and can travel at 20 nautical miles per hour, are all items of compensation that the Allied countries want to acquire.</p>
<p>From the above explanations, we know that the Allied Headquarters' unilateral measures not only further help Japan to revive its maritime armed forces, which is contrary to the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the Far Eastern Commission's policy towards Japan, but also damages the compensation for the Allied countries' ship equipment. This is such a major event! I hope that our government and the countries along the Pacific coast will quickly seek effective countermeasures and prevent Japan's attempt to rearm!</p>

<h3 id="e24">Nationwide Overcast and Rainy Weather Yesterday Affected Solar Eclipse Observation; Measurement Results with Electrical Equipment Conformed to Predictions <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The annular solar eclipse phenomenon this morning, which the people of the whole country were interested in, according to the Central Meteorological Observatory, has obviously been frustrated by the universal overcast and rainy weather in various places, and everyone was greatly disappointed that they could not witness it. There was overcast and rainy weather in Nanjing this morning. From 8 o'clock, light rain fell, and the solar eclipse could not be observed. The informal observation prepared by the Tianwen [astronomical] Institute (and the Surveying Bureau) at Zijin Mountain was cancelled. However, at around 10:50 a.m., the sky was abnormally dark, the only reminder to the citizens that it was the time of maximum eclipse.</p>
<p>[Our report] This city had an unremarkable solar eclipse phenomenon yesterday morning due to haze and clouds. After 9:30, the sky became dark, like when it is overcast and raining. By 10:15, it was as dark as dusk, and many homes and shops had turned on their lights. Five minutes later, the darkness became even more severe, resembling the moment before a summer thunderstorm, with a cool breeze blowing and a chill in the air. The sound of firecrackers rose from the streets, and many people on high buildings and balconies looked up at the solar eclipse, but due to the low clouds, nothing could be seen. After 11 o'clock, it gradually became brighter, and at 11:15, the eclipsed sun, narrow like a new moon, could be seen in the clouds. At 12:15 noon, it returned to normal.</p>
<p>[Our report, Hangzhou, 9th] For today's annular solar eclipse, the surveying team jointly formed by the American Geographical Society and the military department, and the observation team jointly formed by the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica and the Surveying Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, observed the solar eclipse at the Cibiwu of Yuhang, 43 kilometers northwest of Hangzhou. The former's station was located at Dongwu Gang Peak at 119 degrees 50 minutes 44 seconds east longitude, 30 degrees 26 minutes 25 seconds north latitude, and 260 meters above sea level, presided over by Father Hayden of the United States and Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica, and Kastrin, planning to take films and engage in geodetic surveying; the latter was on a hillside at 119 degrees 50 minutes 30 seconds east longitude and 30 degrees 26 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, presided over by Chen Zunyi, Shi Yao, Xia Jianbai, and other nine people, and their work was to determine the time of contact, take the beginning and end of the changes in the solar eclipse phenomenon, and measure the change in solar luminosity during the solar eclipse. From 4:00 to 6:30 this morning, there was light rain, and after the rain, there were dense clouds. The American team could not work, and the Chinese team could only use the electrical equipment of the Physics Department of Central University to measure the luminosity, recording it every five minutes half an hour before and after the first contact, and every minute between the front and back five minutes</p>
<h3 id="e25">Successfully Filmed Spectrums; Qingdao Observation Work Achieved Satisfactory Results <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Our report, Qingdao, 9th] Today, the city's sky was completely covered by high-altitude clouds. The trace of the solar disk was not seen during the first contact of the solar eclipse, and the observation work could not be carried out. Forty scientific workers were also filled with sorrow, but the high-altitude ionosphere test could still be carried out, and the radio waves emitted from Tokyo and other places were significantly reduced. During the recovery process, the cloud layer thinned, and the solar disk was like a light veil, occasionally revealing its full appearance. The observers seized this once-in-a-millennium opportunity and achieved considerable satisfactory results. Among them, the spectrum filming was the most successful. The purpose of this test was to hope to discover the existence of new elements. According to Wang Huawen, the leader of the Observatory, the observation results can be calculated clearly. According to calculations, the recovery time was 12:29:03.1, and the observation was 12:28:36.5, a difference of 27.9 seconds. The clock interval was recorded every minute, and every half minute between the two minutes before and after. As a result, the first contact was measured at 9:30:27.14, the maximum eclipse was at 10:49:25 to 32 seconds, reaching 7 seconds, and the recovery was at 12:18:11, which was consistent with the prediction. At the darkest time of the maximum eclipse, the ratio of luminosity to that before the first contact was 500 to 1.</p>
<p>[Our report, Taipei, 9th] This morning, the sky in Taipei was overcast with intermittent light rain, making it impossible to precisely measure the time of the initial eclipse. It was not until 9:40:30 that the sun's upper right side was seen to be deficient by 19%. At 10:04, it reached 46%. After that, the sun was covered by clouds. At 10:40:24, the maximum eclipse occurred, with the sun's lower left side deficient by about 86%. By 12:09:42, it was restored. During the maximum eclipse, the sky was like dusk, and there was a slight drizzle, which, according to the Meteorological Institute's analysis, seemed to be affected by the solar eclipse. The Institute also announced the impact of the solar eclipse on temperature.

<h3 id="e35">Amid an Atmosphere of Riots, Arson, and Assassination: South Korea Holds its First Popular Election; 6 Million Armed Troops on Alert <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Seoul, 9th] On the eve of Korea's first popular election in 4,000 years, riots are widespread south of the 38th parallel. 60,000 armed police and 1 million volunteer militia members are stationed in cities, towns, and villages to protect candidates, voters, election officials, and polling stations, but they cannot completely quell the flames of the riots. Moreover, the Pyongyang radio station, controlled by the Soviet Union, broadcasts to the South Korean people all day long, urging them to prevent the election from taking place by various means. Secret documents in Russian and Korean, seized by the authorities, detail North Korea's orchestrated violent anti-terrorism plans, and it is expected that the atmosphere of terror will reach its peak on Monday, the day voting begins. Reports pouring into South Korean police stations are filled with news of assassinations, arson, and sabotage of railroads and telegraphic communications. This morning, another right-wing candidate was assassinated, making him the sixth victim among the candidates. Furthermore, three trains were derailed due to sabotage. In the inland city of Taegu (transliteration), a gun battle broke out between left- and right-wing elements, resulting in two deaths on each side. A delayed report states that when left-wing elements on Geomun Island took action, four were killed by the police. A strict curfew is in effect throughout South Korea on the night of the 9th, and the U.S. Army has been ordered to be ready to mobilize within half an hour if necessary. All Korean political parties and groups participating in the general election agree that establishing a Korean government is the first step towards independence, with the only opposition coming from the Communist Party. Some right-wing minority parties believe that the election cannot be held at present. The powers of the assembly include enacting laws and electing the president and prime minister. One hundred seats in the assembly will be reserved for North Korean participation. The final results of the election are not expected to be revealed until Wednesday evening or Thursday morning. The number of people who actually vote is of most interest to the general public. The Communist Party, under North Korea's command, will refuse to vote. There are a total of 8 million eligible voters in South Korea, with approximately 7 million registered. American observers predict that if the actual number of voters reaches half of the registered voters, it will be equivalent to a victory for the Communist Party. A curfew has been imposed in Seoul starting tonight. The streets are deserted at night, with only armed police and volunteer self-defense teams patrolling. Starting from the 9th, officials in charge of occupying the Chang Bureau have been ordered to avoid participating in all Korean gatherings and not to linger on the streets. The U.S. authorities' directive points out that this period will be the most critical since the occupation of Korea. In Seoul alone, starting at dawn on Monday, 7,000 armed police officers, 1,500 special guards, and 9,000 self-defense team members will be on guard. Nearly one in four able-bodied men in South Korea is participating in the self-defense teams, but the U.S. authorities are not certain that Seoul can maintain order. Korean police say that large quantities of weapons have been secretly transported from North Korea via land and sea routes to South Korea in recent days to supply terrorists. Secret orders were found on several arrested leaders of the South Korean Labor Party (Communist Party), instructing them to set fire as a signal for an attack, and to attack polling stations with "Molotov cocktails" disguised as voters infiltrating the polling stations. United Nations polling supervisors, under strict protection, have left Seoul for the countryside. From 5:00 PM on Friday to 3:00 PM on the 9th, a total of 39 people were assassinated, 14 were injured, 6 were missing, 133 were arrested, 24 train engines were destroyed, over 6,000 ballots were destroyed, and a total of 60 sabotage incidents occurred.</p>

<p>[United Press, Rome, 8th] The Italian Communist Party caused a disturbance in the new parliament during the opening ceremony of Italy's first free parliament in twenty-five years, just three minutes after Bonomi was elected Speaker of the Senate. The uproar occurred when left-wing senators demanded that Italy establish a refuge for Greek Communists who were expelled by Argentina, leaving the government speechless. The 330 senators then engaged in an off-seat shouting match.</p>
<p>Mr. De Lassini, chairman of the Italian Committee for Democratic Greece and a Communist senator, had unsuccessfully run for Speaker of the Senate. He gave Bonomi a note, and after Bonomi read it, De Lassini declared that he wanted to know whether the government intended to provide asylum for Greek patriotic fighters who had been expelled by Argentina and were about to be repatriated to Greece. Left-wing senators then shouted, "Long live the Greek patriots!" Senators in the center and on the right stood up and shouted, "Long live the Italians imprisoned in the Soviet Union!" Several Communist senators rushed to their seats and shouted, "It's all their fault!" Bonomi banged the gavel for a full minute before the senators returned to their seats.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Bizarre Murder Case at the Wuzhou Hotel; Woman Wrapped in a Bloodstained Quilt; Corpse Hidden Under the Bed for Three Days; Man Claimed to be Studying in Shanghai and Living with Her Flees <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Last month, on the 18th, a young couple checked into the Wuzhou Hotel, located at Nos. 2-4, Lane 517, Yidong Road and Hubei Road, in Tongting Lane. They stayed in Room No. 9 on the ground floor. The man, said to be named Yu Xingbo, 21 years old, from Haimen, was wearing a blue cloth jacket, a Western-style shirt and socks, and khaki Western-style pants. He referred to the woman as his wife, Shen, 17 years old, also from Haimen. The woman was wearing a floral print cheongsam and black leather shoes. She seemed generous and told people at the hotel that she had come to Shanghai to study.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 6th of this month, Yu left the hotel and never returned. The waiters, seeing that they had stayed for many days and left their luggage behind, were unconcerned and did not suspect anything amiss. It was not until yesterday afternoon at around 1 p.m. that a waiter, Mr. Qi (from Wuxi), opened the door to the room to clean it. He noticed a strange smell that made him want to vomit. He looked around the bed and saw nothing, but the bedding was neat and the tables, chairs, and tea tables were in their usual places. However, he discovered that one of the hotel's quilts was missing. Looking under the bed, he found a large package. Realizing something was wrong, he immediately reported it to the front desk and called for his colleagues to help drag the heavy object out. They unwrapped the outer layer of burlap, and inside was a red quilt from the hotel. Continuing to unwrap it, they were shocked to find a female corpse. Upon closer inspection, they recognized her as the female guest who had said she was coming to Shanghai to study. The corpse was wearing a red floral print blouse, and the lower half of her body was naked. The quilt was covered in bloodstains, which had turned purplish-black due to the passage of several days.</p>
<p>The hotel authorities immediately reported the incident to the Old Zhabei Police Branch. Upon receiving the report, Deputy Branch Chief Yan immediately ordered Criminal Division Chief Jiang Shangpei to oversee the division and Zhang Huaidong, Zhong Youlin, and other officers to rush to the scene to investigate. At the same time, the Criminal Division of the City Police Bureau dispatched Deputy Division Chief Ma Feiji and police officers to the scene to take photographs of the corpse. It was also discovered that the female corpse had three stab wounds to the head, one stab wound to the right forearm, and bruising on the buttocks. The body was transported to Renji Hospital and then to the morgue for an autopsy. Meanwhile, officers from the police bureau continued to search the room and later found a kitchen knife under the wash basin. The knife was stained with blood, and it was taken back to the police station for safekeeping. Although the cause of the woman's death is not yet clear, it is certain that the murderer must have been the male guest who came with her. The Old Zhabei Police Bureau is currently in pursuit.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Mr. Clark, Vice President of the World Federalist Movement, arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 5th. Li Shizeng, a representative of collective organizations in the social sector, and Wu Zhihui, a representative of the World Cultural Cooperation Association, held a discussion meeting at the auditorium of the World Society yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to invite Mr. Clark to express his views on world federation and to invite people from all walks of life in the city to participate and exchange ideas extensively. According to Mr. Li Shizeng, who met with reporters, "Mr. Clark is a faithful believer in the ideal of world federation. He hopes that his ideal can become a reality within two years, transforming the current United Nations into a world federal government. To achieve rapid results, his activities focus on political aspects, especially emphasizing the connection between national parliaments and parliamentarians. The activities of the World Society focus on social aspects, starting with the people, which is more stable but takes longer to be effective. This is the difference between our society and Mr. Clark. However, political and social activities do not conflict, and we will do our best to assist. Mr. Clark hopes to establish an organization for the World Federalist Movement in China during this visit, and especially hopes that our country can send representatives to the international meeting to be held in Luxembourg this September. After today's discussion meeting, a temporary preparatory organization can be established."

<h3 id="e74">Another Amazing Record at the National Games: Qi Peilin's Discus Throw Reaches 41.55 Meters; New Harvests Expected in Today's 10,000-Meter Final; A Hundred-Section Long Snake Wriggles on Jiangwan Road; Crowds at the Stadium Reach a Frenzy <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The wind and rain came last night. If it clears today, all competitions, except for men's and women's tennis and men's table tennis, will enter the round-robin stage. The track and field finals are also on the last day. The 10,000-meter final, in which the silent long-distance running hero Lou Wen'ao will participate, is sure to be a highlight today. According to the organizing committee, if there is torrential rain, the various programs will be decided on an ad hoc basis. However, indoor competitions will proceed as usual regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the Games and a regular Sunday. The morning sun was gentle, the air was crisp, and the wind was mild. The citizens and cars of Shanghai almost knocked each other down to rush to the following three locations: the city center, Hongqiao Airport, and Yiyuan.</p>
<p>At the main venue of the Games: Jiangwan. On the 美路, all kinds of vehicles were connected from east to west. At the most congested times, traffic moved slowly at a speed of ten miles per hour, like a wriggling hundred-section snake. The track and field stadium, basketball courts, tennis courts, gymnasium, and even the swimming pool, which had no programs scheduled, were packed with spectators. The cultural street in front of the West Commander's Platform was particularly crowded. According to preliminary estimates, there were more than 150,000 spectators. The atmosphere was boiling, reaching a frenzy. The grandstand of the track and field stadium was so swollen that three or four thousand spectators jumped into the field. The order inside the venue was chaotic, and the competition was once suspended. The entire security team worked tirelessly throughout the day and made extraordinary efforts to prevent accidents, which is commendable.</p>
<p>At Hongqiao Airport: 70 paratroopers gave China's first parachute performance. There were more than 100,000 spectators. More than 3,000 cars blocked all traffic on Hongqiao Road. At Yiyuan: there were two soccer semi-final matches, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. More than 50,000 soccer fans gathered outside the venue, a sea of heads.</p>
<p>The men's discus was the rich harvest of yesterday. The champion and runner-up broke the national record with 41.55 meters and 41.155 meters, respectively. The third place also broke the Games record.</p>
<p>Men's Track and Field Score Statistics: Taiwan added another six points, totaling 111.5 points, and already holds the championship. There was no change in the other rankings: Air Force 47, Shanghai 41, Navy 34. In women's track and field, Hebei still leads, adding one point to 26. Beiping is second with 23 points. Qingdao and Taiwan are closely following behind with 16 points each and will pose a threat to Hebei.</p>
<p>In the men's basketball semi-finals, the Joint Logistics Command defeated Tianjin in a close battle for the right to the final four. In the other matches, Filipino-Chinese defeated the Air Force, the Police defeated Shenyang, Shanghai defeated the Navy, and the situation was one-sided.</p>
<p>In the four soccer semi-final matches, Hong Kong defeated Zhejiang with considerable effort. The Army defeated Malaya almost by chance. The Police defeated 邏羅平平淡淡. Dalian lost to Shanghai and vented their anger on the referee, resorting to violence, which is truly "shameful" and "regrettable"!</p>
<h3 id="e75">Remarkable Men's Discus Performance: First and Second Place Break National Records, Third Place Also Sets Games Record; Chen Biying of the Women's Long Jump Wins the Championship with a Tight Last Jump <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's field events included the finals of the men's discus and women's long jump. The men's discus performance was spectacular, with the first and second place results breaking the national record. The third place also broke the Games record, which is truly remarkable. The women's long jump results were average. The competition details are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Discus: 51 athletes registered, but only 30 actually participated. The throwing began at about 2:00 PM. Before long, spectators rushed onto the field, causing great chaos. The competition was suspended once. After order was restored, the throwing resumed. In the three preliminary throws, only ten people exceeded 30 meters. Qi Peilin of Tianjin, the champion of the shot put, suddenly exceeded the national record mark in his last throw of the preliminary round. Upon measurement, it was 41.55 meters, leading the pack with this result. Wang Rui of the Air Force, whose highest result in the preliminary round was 39.16 meters, was depressed. In the final stage, each throw improved, and the last throw actually exceeded the national record mark, causing Lao Qi to break into a cold sweat. Upon measurement, it was 41.155 meters, placing second. Liu Jing of Taiwan placed third. The old national record holder, Guo Jianzhang (Guo Jie) of Liaoning, was old and past his prime, only getting 35.675 meters, placing fourth. The results of the major rankings are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Qi Peilin (Tianjin) 41.55 meters</p>
<p>(2) Wang Rui (Air Force) 41.155 meters</p>
<p>(3) Liu Jing (Taiwan) 38.54 meters</p>
<p>(4) Guo Jianzhang (Liaoning) 35.675 meters</p>
<p>(5) Yu Zongxiong (Taiwan) 33.98 meters</p>
<p>(6) Wu Zhenwu (Navy) 33.83 meters</p>
<p>Women's Long Jump: No fewer than 30 people participated in the long jump. After a long melee, only eight people exceeded four meters. In the preliminary round, Chen Ruinian of Qingdao took the lead with 4.6儿5 meters on her first jump. Ms. Chen's jumping posture was excellent, but her subsequent jumps showed slight fatigue, and the results failed to improve. Chen Biying of Fujian had the highest hopes of winning the championship, but her results in the preliminary round yesterday were not outstanding. In the final stage, she gritted her teeth on her last jump and used all her strength, finally getting 4.83 meters, overwhelming Little Chen of Qingdao in one fell swoop. Except for Zhang Ganmei of Taiwan, who made slight progress in the final round, the other athletes made no progress. The final ranking results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chen Biying (Fujian) 4.83 meters</p>
<p>(2) Chen Ruinian (Qingdao) 4.695 meters</p>
<p>(3) Wu Shuying (Fujian) 4.47 meters</p>
<p>(4) Zhang Ganmei (Taiwan) 4.39 meters</p>
<p>(5) Lin Zhenji (Beijing) 4.34 meters</p>
<p>(6) Zhao Hong (Hebei) 4.19 meters</p>

<h3 id="e76">Men's and Women's Track and Field Preliminary and Quarterfinals: Yu Xiwei Leads in the 800 Meters; Huang Liangzheng is First in the Intermediate Hurdles; Wang Shugui Wins the 60 Meters; Chen Biying is Best in the 200 Meters <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, all of the men's and women's track and field events were preliminary and quarterfinal rounds. For the men's group, the preliminary rounds were for the 800 meters and 1600-meter relay. The quarterfinal rounds were for the 200 meters and intermediate hurdles. For the women's group, the preliminary rounds were for the 60 meters and 400-meter relay. The quarterfinal rounds were for the 60 meters and 200 meters.</p>
<p>In the men's preliminary round, the 800 meters was held in three groups. Veteran Yu Xiwei won the first group of the third group with a time of 2 minutes 8.7 seconds, which was the best of the three groups. He won very easily, leaving the second place about ten meters behind. The first place in the other two groups were Li Linglong of Liaoning and Song Wenjian of Qingdao. Chen Yinglang of Taiwan registered but did not participate. Twelve finalists will compete today. The 1600-meter relay race was held while it was already raining and was completed in the rain. The results were average. The Taiwan team was one of the best groups in the three groups, also reaching 3 minutes 43.6 seconds. It is hoped that they can improve in today's final. The intermediate hurdles quarterfinals were divided into three groups. The first group of Huang Liangzheng of Malaya still had the best result, 59.4 seconds, not far from the Games record of 59.0 seconds. The other two groups were all above 60 seconds. There is no question that Huang Liangzheng will win both hurdles championships. In the 200-meter quarterfinals, the best performers in the secondary competition the day before were all selected. This event was also held in the rain, so the result of 23.6 seconds was just average. In today's final, Rong Chengbiao of Shanghai and the Taiwan athletes will have a fierce battle.</p>
<p>In the women's preliminary round, the 60 meters was held in eight groups. The results of the two groups of Wang Shugui of Qingdao and Li Xinyi of Chongqing were both 8.6 seconds, while the others even exceeded 9 seconds. In the quarterfinals, Wang Shugui shortened it by another tenth of a second, winning the first group of the second group with 8.5 seconds. In today's final, the female generals who won the 100-meter race the day before, Wang Shugui, Li Xinyi, Guo Meili, and Li Xiaobi, will compete again. It seems that Wang Shugui can steadily win another championship. After winning the long jump championship, Chen Biying of Fujian competed in the 200-meter quarterfinals, 29.2 seconds, the best result. The other finalists were still Wang Shugui, Li Xinyi, Li Xiaojiong, Mei Shunyan, and others. However, the result of more than 29 seconds was really too bad. The competition in the rain may be one of the reasons for the decline.</p>

<p>In yesterday's track and field events, there was a race walking exhibition with only three participants, Tan Rongsheng, Zhou Ruquan, and Cai Zhengyi, all of whom were experts in this field ten years ago. Cai participated this time representing Hong Kong. The race walking exhibition was originally scheduled for 10,000 meters, but was temporarily changed to 5,000 meters to avoid delaying other track and field programs. Tan Rongsheng took the lead after 1,500 meters and led all the way to the finish line, leaving Cai Zhengyi about 250 meters behind and Zhou Ruquan about 300 meters behind. The result was 26 minutes and 24 seconds. Cai Zhengyi's time was 27 minutes and 25 seconds.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch] The football championship quarter-finals took place yesterday, with all four groups playing at the athletic field and Yi Garden. Spectators flocked to both locations, taking advantage of the weekend holiday. All four venues were packed, an unprecedented sight. The audience was keen to know who would be the final four. The eight teams battled fiercely, creating a tense atmosphere both on and off the field. Skillful footwork and roaring applause echoed each other, creating an exceptionally enthusiastic atmosphere. As predicted, Hong Kong defeated Zhejiang 3-0, the Police defeated Siam China 2-1, Shanghai defeated Dalian 3-1, and the Army defeated Malaysia China 3-1. The Hong Kong, Police, Shanghai, and Army teams will now compete for the championship title in a series of close matches starting tomorrow. Yesterday morning there was a solar eclipse, followed by a sudden downpour in the afternoon. All four matches proceeded during the eclipse and heavy rain until their conclusion. In the Shanghai vs. Dalian match, there was a minor disturbance when a Dalian player assaulted the referee. The organizing committee and the Dalian team were still discussing a resolution late into the evening. The two football preliminary matches that were postponed due to rain the day before were played yesterday afternoon at Zhongzheng Park. Qingdao won against Guizhou 1-0, and Hankou drew with the Philippines 2-2. Due to more rain, extra time was not played, and a replay is scheduled for today at the athletic field.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Zhejiang Overwhelmed; Hong Kong's "Odd Foot" Scores a Hat-Trick <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong vs. Zhejiang match took place at Yi Garden at 9:00 AM, with Li Guoyi as the referee and Deng Xiaoliang and Zhang Zhiren as linesmen. After the kickoff, Hong Kong attacked first, with the five forwards pushing forward rapidly. In the back-and-forth attacks, Hong Kong's center forward, Li Deqi (known as "Odd Foot" in Hong Kong), received the ball at the midline and scored the first goal. Zhejiang tried to counterattack, but with the rain having just stopped, the grass was quite slippery. Although Zhejiang tried hard to advance, their passing was too slow, their coordination lacked vitality, and their footwork seemed weak. Thus, any hesitation allowed the Hong Kong defenders to rush in and intercept, negating the attack. Numerous opportunities were missed afterward. Whenever a Zhejiang player shot, the ball either went slightly wide or over the line, causing the thousands of spectators in the stands to lament in unison. Hong Kong's attack grew increasingly urgent, but fortunately, Zhejiang's defenders and goalkeeper were competent, repeatedly making crucial saves and earning considerable applause. Although Zhejiang was losing, they were able to rally with renewed vigor, largely due to the encouragement of the audience. Unfortunately, just before the end of the first half, Hong Kong's Li Deqi received a pass from Li Chunfa, dribbled quickly, and scored with a sweeping shot, making it 2-0, greatly diminishing Zhejiang's confidence in making a comeback.</p>
<p>After the change of ends, the audience continued to applaud and support Zhejiang, which inspired Xiao Ziwen and Lin Dianyi to make several all-out shots. However, Hong Kong proved to be superior, with Feng Kunsheng and Tan Jun'gan defending meticulously, blocking several shots in a clear and impressive manner. Amid Zhejiang's scoreless predicament, center-back Wu Jiabang committed a foul, allowing Li Deqi to take a penalty kick from 25 yards out, which he converted successfully. Subsequently, Zhejiang's left winger, Wu Binghao, was injured and had to leave the field. After intense battling for some time, the match concluded, with Hong Kong securing a spot in the finals thanks to Li Deqi's three goals.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Siam China's Fortune is Bumpy; Police Win by a Narrow Margin <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The match between the Police and Siam China was not particularly exciting. Siam China's defense was weak, and although their forwards were somewhat satisfactory, they lacked good fortune. They had three shots that hit the goalposts and bounced out; otherwise, the situation might have been different. The Police team had average strength, but their performance was not as good as expected, so the final score was a narrow 2-1 victory, with the muddy field after the rain being a significant factor.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Police team attacked with the wind advantage, and the ball was often in Siam China's territory. After four minutes, Siam China's defender Hu Qinshu intercepted the ball near the sideline and kicked it out, only to have it land right in front of the goal. The Police's center forward, Zhao Fulai, received it perfectly and dribbled straight in. The Siam China players rushed to defend, but in the ensuing chaos, Zhao Fulai kicked the ball straight into the net, making it 1-0. Siam China launched a full-scale counterattack. After twelve minutes, right forward Huang Junqin had an opportunity to shoot diagonally, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. Left inside forward Liang Shunfa was a step too late, missing a golden opportunity to score. Afterward, the ball was often near the Siam China goal, creating several dangerous situations. After twenty-two minutes, Police's Tan Zhenhui committed a foul, and Siam China's Huang Jingqin took the free kick, passing it to Han Jingfeng, whose shot hit the crossbar and bounced out. Liang Shunfa followed up with another shot, which hit the left goalpost. Their bad luck was a source of regret for the spectators. After twenty-six minutes, Police's Xie Jinhe took a free kick and passed it to Zhao Fu. Siam China's marking was lax, and Zhao Fu seized the opportunity to shoot, scoring again, making it 2-0. Afterward, Siam China's forwards made several attempts to score, but all were saved by Police goalkeeper Yu Yaode. The first half ended with Siam China down by two goals. After the break, Siam China gradually improved. After five minutes, right inside forward Zheng Youzhi shot fiercely near the Police goal, but the ball hit the crossbar again and was cleared by the Police inside defender. After eight minutes, Zheng Youzhi received another ball from the back and dribbled straight into the Police penalty area, unleashing a powerful shot from about ten yards out that found the net. After Siam China pulled a goal back, the match became intense, with both sides exchanging attacks and making several attempts to score, but none were successful. Near the end of the match, Police's Liu Tianyou mishit a clearance, and Siam China's Zheng Youzhi sent a long pass to the left front. With the Police team having committed all their players forward, their defense was completely empty. Siam China's left forward Chen Jingxing rushed forward, but just as he was about to shoot near the goal, he too mishit the ball, losing the final opportunity. Shortly afterward, time ran out, and the Police won against Siam China 2-1.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Dalian Nervous; Shanghai Turns Defeat into Victory with Strength <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The match between Shanghai and Dalian was very intense and hard-fought. Although the Dalian team had plenty of strength, they were long on bravery but short on coordination. They were also too nervous, repeatedly arguing with referee Xu Shaowu about free kicks during the match, leading to an unpleasant incident after the match where they assaulted the referee. The Shanghai team had excellent short-passing skills. Center-back Tan Fu was skilled both in attack and defense, and the other defenders were also good, so their victory was more than deserved.</p>
<p>The match began amidst light rain, with Dalian launching fierce attacks, while the Shanghai team defended calmly. After fifteen minutes, Dalian's left forward Jiang Benshen made a deep run on the wing and scored the first goal. The Shanghai team counterattacked, and Dalian's inside defender committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Shanghai's Sun Jinshun took the penalty, but the ball hit the goalpost and bounced out. After a period of back-and-forth action, both sides made several attempts to score, but none were successful. Shortly afterward, Dalian's Wang Zhengwen committed a foul, and the Shanghai team was awarded a free kick, which was passed into the goal area. Xia Tixian rushed forward and deflected the ball in, tying the score at 1-1. A few minutes later, Shanghai's five forwards advanced together, passing the ball to Han Longhai near the goal. Han Longhai shot diagonally, and the Dalian goalkeeper was unable to stop it, making it 2-1 to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The second half was even more intense. Players frequently slipped and fell on the muddy field, but after a long battle, neither side was able to score. Then, near the end of the match, Shanghai's Li Yao took a corner kick, passing the ball several times to Han Longhai, who, from about thirty yards out, unleashed a high shot. The ball slowly descended from the air and landed right into the goal. The Dalian goalkeeper was helpless to stop it, and the match ended with Shanghai winning 3-1.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Malaysia China Forward Line Strong but Fades; Army Turns the Tide with Composure <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon match between the Army and Malaysia China at Yi Garden attracted a huge crowd. Malaysia China relied on their surprising aggression, launching relentless attacks in the first half, but their momentum waned in the second half, becoming slack and uncoordinated. The Army responded with a composed strategy, ultimately using skillful footwork to break through, leading to Malaysia China's defeat. In the first half, Malaysia China's two defenders put their full effort into defending their area and passing the ball to the forwards, who advanced with great concentration. As a result, left inside forward Liang Kaiming was able to overcome all obstacles and score with ease, with Huang Shijie following up and putting the ball into the net, giving Malaysia China the lead. Shortly afterward, center forward Mei Runhua was injured and replaced by Li Sida. The Army took advantage of the moment when the enemy team was adjusting its lineup to launch a major attack. Left winger Jin Lusheng made several attempts to shoot, but they were all saved by Huang Jintang. However, just before the end of the first half, Fei Chunhua seized an opportunity amidst the chaos and equalized the score with a long shot from the left corner.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, the two teams continued to battle fiercely. The audience, frustrated by the prolonged stalemate, grew impatient and started to clap and shout, their emotions reaching a boiling point. Inspired by this, the Army fought even harder, with Luo Shoufu and Jin Lusheng scoring within a dozen minutes, securing a 3-1 victory as expected.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Dalian Players Vent Anger on Referee <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Lu Changtai Detained</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] After the football championship match between Dalian and Shanghai, in which Dalian lost, the Dalian team believed that referee Xu Shaowu was unfair. As soon as the match ended, several players chased after the referee to argue with him. Fortunately, officials from the organizing committee and other referees had noticed the tense situation during the match and, fearing trouble after the match, had already notified a large number of police officers, who were on standby. Upon seeing what happened, they immediately rushed forward, but Xu Shaowu had already been grabbed by the hair and punched. Spectators on the west command platform were outraged by the Dalian players' actions and shouted for them to be beaten, creating a chaotic scene. The police officers worked hard to maintain order, escorting referee Xu Shaowu to the security room and detaining the Dalian substitute player Lu Changtai who had committed the assault. After the incident, all the football referees lodged a strong protest with the organizing committee, demanding that the assaulting player be severely punished and that their safety be guaranteed in the future. Dalian team leader Liu Huakun and Northeast representative Liu Changchun requested that the organizing committee release the detained player. Secretary-General Hao Gengsheng believed that this matter could only be resolved if the referees were willing to reconcile. Liu and others then discussed the matter with the referees, but no agreement had been reached by late evening. The organizing committee decided at its meeting last night to increase security from today onward to maintain safety.</p>

<p>The fourth type of "beat-up" incident occurred yesterday, which was players beating up a referee. ((1) So-and-so beats up an organizing committee member, (2)(3) organizing committee member beats up organizing committee member, (3) player beats up player, (4) player beats up referee.) What roles are left? Spectators and reporters.</p>
<p>The hero who did the beating yesterday is reportedly still being detained in the police station, unresolved. From any perspective, we advocate for strict punishment, naturally with the aim of curbing further occurrences.</p>
<p>However, if it's a case of killing the chicken to scare the monkey, then it would be despicable, bullying the weak and fearing the strong, something that a wise person would not do.</p>
<p>Buying a ticket but not being able to enter the venue, that's being cheated. The organizing committee shouldn't cheat to get money like that; if there are more instances of profiting from troubled waters, then it would be unspeakable.</p>
<p>Refund tickets and give money back? It's impossible. I'm very worried about those few ticket booths. The Taiwan delegation, an inspiring and lovely group. Unfortunately, it's just such a group... Alas, I don't know how many more "alas" there will be. They come as a team, they leave as a team, with the team flag in front. They sing loudly on the way there and back, receiving applause and cheers along the way. I think that this is the only glory of this Games. I don't value those national records that are broken, or even world records that are broken. If every unit can maintain such discipline, even if it's 18 seconds for 100 meters or a 5-meter long jump, it won't be ugly. (O.K.)</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The performance of Combined Logistics on the 8th was not spectacular. Many shots missed the basket. Liao Dihang's saying that "the flower blooms as soon as the ball is tossed" did not come to fruition.</p>
<p>In the Filipino team's match on the 8th, every shot went in, reversing the inaccurate shooting in the match on the 7th. Some people said that the Filipino team had studied the gymnasium's basketball hoops in depth. In the Filipino team's match against the Air Force, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou made a special trip to watch the game. At halftime, he ordered Hu Weike, the principal of the Air Force Military Academy, to give instructions to the team members.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai team played, female athletes from Shanghai came to cheer them on, making the game particularly exciting. (Yu)</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, a total of four women's basketball re-matches were held at 2:00 PM at the Second and Sixth Courts. As a result, Indonesia narrowly defeated Guangzhou by one point; Shanghai decisively defeated Hebei; the Hubei vs. Philippines match, and the Fujian vs. Nanjing match, were played in heavy rain. The players fought bravely in the rain, and the referees officiated in the rain, a commendable spirit.</p>
<p>Indonesia Barely Wins Against Guangzhou</p>
<p>Based on previous performances, Indonesia should have easily defeated Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Shanghai Defeats Hebei</p>
<p>In the Shanghai vs. Hebei match, Huang Mingyuan scored the first basket. Wang Weizhen committed a foul, and Hebei missed the free throw. Shanghai took the lead with a score of 2-0. At this moment, Mingyuan caught the ball near the basket, broke through, and Ma Guisheng tripped her, causing her to lose consciousness on the spot. After first aid, she re-entered the court after five minutes. Shi Zonglan and Yin Yunying displayed their shooting skills. In the first quarter, the score was 6-4, with Shanghai in the lead. Afterwards, Hebei gradually weakened. Shi Zonglan, Huang Minghuan, and Wang Huiling scored consecutively. Hebei relied solely on Yin Yunying's individual efforts. In the end, Shanghai defeated Hebei with a score of 34-18.</p>

<p>Philippines Defeats Hubei</p>
<p>In the Philippines vs. Hubei match, heavy rain began shortly after the start of the game. Hubei's defense couldn't defend against the Philippine team's forward's fierce attacks. Yang Xiuzhi and Huang Rulan were very active under Hubei's basket. In the first quarter, the score was 15-8, and in the first half, the score was 23-10, both with the Philippine team in the lead. He Manli of Hubei had excellent individual skills. It's rare to find such talent in the mainland, but unfortunately, the guards were too weak, resulting in a situation where the gains didn't outweigh the losses. In the end, Hubei lost with a score of 45-30.</p>

<p>Fujian Valiantly Defeats Nanjing</p>
<p>The Nanjing vs. Fujian match was the most intense and fierce moment yesterday. Wang Qiman and Hu Weiling of Nanjing, although short in stature, had extremely pure basic movements, but their shooting accuracy was not as accurate as their previous performances. In the first half, Nanjing still had an advantage with a score of 9-8. Afterwards, the scores were tied at 13 each. The weather suddenly changed, and the two teams fought in the rain. Nanjing's guards had strong defensive power, and Fujian couldn't break through. Xu Xinxi recklessly attempted long-range shots, most of which were off target. Ju Cai's two shots determined the overall situation. Fujian finally won with a score of 27-19.</p>

At 5:10 PM, it rained again and didn't stop. The indoor temperature was 68 degrees, but the audience crowded the venue and didn't disperse.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Hongqiao Airport Packed; 200,000 Eyes Fully Mobilized; Competing to Watch the Parachute Jumping Performance; The Games Can't Control the Sky; Enjoy the Show Even Without Buying a Ticket <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The paratrooper parachute jumping performance, which was not held on the opening day of the National Games due to bad weather, was held at Hongqiao Airport yesterday noon. The citizens were very interested in the novelty of the program. After 10:00 AM, the audience continuously gathered towards Hongqiao Airport. Cars, bicycles, group charters, and pedestrians created an unprecedented spectacle on Hongqiao Road.</p>
<p>The audience around the airport exceeded 100,000 people, and the total number of cars was over 3,000. The airport's order was maintained by the ground crew of the Civil Aviation Transportation Corps, strictly restricting the audience from approaching the airport runway. Outside the venue, traffic was directed in sections by the police force, cadre training corps, military police, and other units. The audience arriving after 1:30 PM was blocked outside the airport and couldn't enter. Parachute jumping from high altitudes could be seen from near and far. The crowd blocked outside the venue occupied the pillboxes built by the Japanese army in the past as temporary stands. The Games couldn't control the sky, so it was a free show, and no tickets were sold. Therefore, the audience was particularly crowded.</p>
<p>The paratroopers performing the parachute jumping, including combat and ground personnel, totaled 70 people, led by Xu Yanwu, the Major General Deputy Commander of the Paratrooper Command, and Yang Chunbai, the Deputy Director, and Jiang Jian, the Deputy Regiment Commander. Two C-46 transport planes, "Xiamen No." and "Liuzhou No.", were borrowed from the Civil Aviation Transportation Corps. "Xiamen No." took off at 12:30 PM. Major Instructor Luo Xueliang first made a test jump, followed by two-person and four-person groups performing pinpoint landings.</p>
<p>Colorful Umbrellas Flutter; Cheers from the Crowd</p>
<p>"Xiamen No." flew diagonally at low altitude. Paratroopers jumped out of the plane's door, and white parachutes opened in the wind, fluttering in space. The entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Only three groups performed pinpoint landings, and the performance ended quickly. After "Xiamen No." landed, all the paratroopers reassembled, carried firearms, and boarded the plane again. "Xiamen" and "Liuzhou" took off simultaneously and flew around the field twice. The ground troops released red signal smoke in the center of the airport. When the plane passed over the red smoke, the paratroopers jumped from the plane one after another from 2,000 feet in a mass descent. For a moment, red, white, and green colorful parachutes dotted the blue sky, like a scattering of heavenly flowers. The entire audience cheered as if thunderstruck.</p>
<p>Descending 2,000 Feet in Two Minutes</p>
<p>The mass descent was held in two groups, with 18 paratroopers in each group, equipped with three parachutes each. Each descent had a total of 21 parachutes. Because the weather was suitable yesterday, the 2,000-foot descent only took two minutes. However, the terrain was uneven, and there were many large puddles due to the rain. Many paratroopers landed in the puddles, getting their clothes wet. It was heard that the original plan was to follow the mass descent with a combat performance and live ammunition shooting, but because there were too many spectators around, fearing accidents, it was temporarily cancelled. Therefore, the entire program ended at one moment. At that time, many spectators mistakenly thought that it would be held at 3:00 PM and were rushing by car to arrive, meeting the cars exiting the airport on the way. One in and one out, Hongqiao Road was completely blocked. All the cars had to line up and drive slowly. It took three hours to go from the airport to Daxilu, which shows the extent of the congestion.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Rain Sprinkles on Qi Peilin; Right Leg Was Injured; Changing Direction; Mind is Mechanized and Precise <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] After Qi Peilin, a Tianjin team athlete, stepped down from the podium, the reporter stepped forward and shook his hand warmly, congratulating him on breaking the national record in the discus throw with a score of 41.55 meters. At this time, he was truly proud. Guo Jianzhang (Jie), the holder of the previous record, had been defeated and placed fourth.</p>
<p>He said modestly: This achievement was really accidental. He said that when he was practicing in Dajin, he only threw 40 meters, and he only threw 38 meters in the preliminary round. Before coming to Shanghai, he had been practicing for about a month, and his score had never exceeded 40 meters. But he also told the reporter that he had once created a record of 42 meters when he was a student.</p>
<p>He is from Gaoyang, Hebei. This year he is 31 years old and already the father of two children. Before the war, he studied at Hebei Institute of Technology. After the war, he finished his studies at the Normal University. After graduating, he is now a professor of mechanical drawing at Tianjin Institute of Technology. From his appearance, although you can't see a very burly physique, you would never think that he is a person with a precise mind close to a machine.</p>
<p>In the past, he said that he liked high jumping very much and often played basketball. His high jump had won the championship of the first Hebei National Games with a score of 1.65 meters, but playing basketball injured his right leg, which made him interested in shot put and discus. He said: "I am a person who loves sports very much, so switching from high jump and basketball to shot put and discus was completely passive." At this time, the reporter laughed and said to him; "Now that your discus has broken the national record, do you want to actively continue your efforts in preparation for winning some glory for the team at the World Games?" He repeatedly said, "I dare not, I dare not!" Although it was still his modesty, I believe that countless people expect him to do the same as the reporter.</p>
<p>From his conversation, the reporter learned that he also has a happy family. His wife is from the same hometown and graduated from Hebei Normal School. The reporter wanted to know if his love of sports also had his wife's encouragement, so I asked: "Does your wife also like sports?" He answered vaguely: "Not very much!"</p>
<p>While they were talking, a reporter from another newspaper came to ask him to sign his name. He writes a good fountain pen script, but I saw that there was no "rain" radical on top of his character "Lin" [in Qi Peilin's name], so I asked him what the character actually was. He said that it was added by someone else when he was registering. It was drizzling in the sky at this time, and everyone laughed and said that he would really get rained on! (Yu)</p>

<h3 id="e95">Who Does the Men's Basketball Championship Belong To? If the Shanghai Team Can Strengthen Cooperation, the Championship May Not Be Lost <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The men's basketball finals start today. The finals adopt a single round-robin system. Each win is worth two points. The team with the most points sits on the throne of the champion, the second most points gets the silver, the next gets the bronze, and the team with all losses gets fourth place. Therefore, which team will be the champion, runner-up, third place, and fourth place? This should be the most concerning thing for fans and readers.</p>
<p>The key to winning or losing in basketball lies in the fact that the average skills of the entire team are above standard, the spirit of cooperation and unity is fully utilized, the team can endure and be patient for a long time, has abundant energy, and has accurate shooting. The four teams that have recently won the right to compete in the finals, such as Shanghai, the Filipino team, Combined Logistics, and the Police, all possess the above conditions, so it is really impossible to make a judgment at this time. However, we have observed their battles for several days, and there are many things that can be used as a reference.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the Shanghai team. The individual skills of each member of the Shanghai team are almost perfect. No one can match their shooting accuracy. The team can also use strategies, calmly respond to battles, and supplement them with their familiar and brand-new tactics, so they naturally have the ambition to win the championship. However, they sometimes neglect the spirit of unity and cooperation. The battle between Shanghai and Saigon was simply a performance of individual skills. In the Shanghai vs. Navy game, the spirit of cooperation could not be brought into full play. Therefore, in the Shanghai vs. Combined Logistics game and the Shanghai vs. Filipino team game, if the spirit of cooperation is not good, the future is not optimistic.</p>
<p>As for the Combined Logistics team, the team is full of energy and is the most durable of the four teams. The playing style is of the northern style, and the spirit of cooperation is still good. However, in the game against Tianjin, the shooting was too inaccurate. Also, Shixuan and Zhiji often go deep into the enemy's formation. If they encounter Shanghai's tactic of luring the enemy deep and then cutting in to score points, Combined Logistics will suffer a big loss. Combined Logistics is sometimes too nervous, but their rapid playing style can be said to be unmatched. In the game against Shanghai, if Combined Logistics can stabilize the rear and cooperate with the frontline attacks, they may be able to achieve some success. Otherwise, once there is a leak, defeat is easy to bear. In the game against the Filipino team, Combined Logistics should still adopt a rapid attack, but they cannot be too flustered. In the game against the Police, they must not be too careless.</p>
<p>The Filipino team is good at using new tactics and strategies, and their spirit of cooperation is also good. The only shortcoming of the team is the lack of a center forward. Therefore, their contest with Shanghai may not be as smooth as they hoped. In the game against Combined Logistics, they must be wary of their strong cuts and long-range attacks. They cannot underestimate the Police in the game against them.</p>
<p>The Police team is really a rising star among the four teams. The skills are average, and the shooting is also accurate. However, because they are relatively young, they are often too nervous when they lose many points. Therefore, they must be careful when dealing with Shanghai, Combined Logistics, and the Filipino team.</p>
<p>In the battle for hegemony, the venue is very important. For example, those who are used to playing outdoors are not used to playing indoors, and those who are used to playing indoors are not used to playing outdoors. Now all four teams are competing indoors. The so-called "floor skills" of those playing indoors is considered to be the best by Shanghai, followed by the Filipino team and the Police, and then Combined Logistics. Therefore, this can also be used to see some key points.</p>
<p>The reporter believes that if the Shanghai team strengthens its spirit of cooperation, it may be able to win the championship. If the shooting accuracy of the Combined Logistics team is still the same as on the 9th, they may lose to Shanghai in the first game. Then Combined Logistics and the Filipino team will compete for the runner-up. However, things are unpredictable. If the Police are particularly attentive and work hard, they may also have the hope of winning the runner-up. If Combined Logistics can fully utilize new strategies and tactics, they may be able to win the championship. If the Filipino team can improve their weakness in the center, they can also enter the first place.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] All spectators entered the venue by queuing with tickets, and the length of the line was no exaggeration. It could encircle the entire venue at least once, breaking all previous queuing records.</p>
<p>To prevent the collapse of the fence from causing accidents, the organizing committee has supported it with thick wooden pillars, temporarily hired a large number of workers to nail horizontal bars onto the wooden frames. Many people climbed down from the stands and sat leisurely on the horizontal bars, almost making them their temporary stands.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the basketball game in the stadium was more crowded than ever. Both doors were broken through. The Boy Scouts could not resist and temporarily moved two small cannons to block the doors. Spectators entered and exited through the broken holes. (Excerpts)</p>

<p>Regarding the return travel arrangements for the All-China Games delegations from various regions, the organizing committee has reached an agreement with the Ministry of Transportation. When using the national railways, a 50% discount will be offered. When taking ships from the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, an 80% discount will be offered. The reception team believes that train tickets and seats on ships and airplanes are currently very crowded. It is necessary to make proper plans as soon as possible. Therefore, all units are notified to inform the reception team immediately of the number of team members, departure date, planned mode of transportation, and the name and address of the person in charge, in order to facilitate arrangements. The Municipal Police Department's Juvenile Police Team has been temporarily suspending its city hygiene inspection work recently to assist in maintaining order within the All-China Games venue. Unexpectedly, the accurate shooting of the Indonesian forwards was greatly diminished yesterday, especially Li Xiuli, who was particularly abnormal and missed many shots. The first quarter ended with a 5-5 tie. Lin Gui won, and Indonesia led 9-6 in the first half. In the second half, the Guangzhou team replaced Rao Huijuan with Huang Youping, greatly strengthening the forward line. They managed to tie the score at 10-10 and 13-13 twice. The third quarter ended with Guangzhou leading 15-14. Li Xiuli scored, and Indonesia led by two points again. With little time remaining, Huang Youping made three consecutive free throws. The buzzer sounded, and Indonesia defeated Guangzhou by one point.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Women's Volleyball Round Robin Begins; Shanghai and Hunan Win, Taiwan and Guangzhou Each Score Two Points; Men's Volleyball Round Robin Starts Today, Guangzhou and Hong Kong Will Have a Fierce Battle <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The men's volleyball round robin starts today. The highly praised Guangzhou team will face its strong opponent, the Hong Kong team, this morning. A fierce battle is expected. Furthermore, the results of yesterday's men's volleyball qualifying matches are as follows: Xinjiang defeated Henan in three straight sets, with scores of 21-17, 21-14, and 21-18. Jilin defeated the Navy, also three to zero, with scores of 21-8, 21-8, and 21-10. Hunan won because the Army forfeited.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The four women's volleyball teams from Shanghai, Taiwan, Hunan, and Guangzhou began their round robin yesterday. Shanghai and Hunan both won in two straight sets, each scoring two points. The Shanghai-Taiwan match was very exciting. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Players Defeat Taiwan</p>
<p>The Shanghai team, with its strong players Chen Meizhen and Huang Mingyuan, was beyond what the Taiwan team could resist. Chen Meizhen is tall and her spikes are fierce, allowing her to be in a commanding position, making it impossible for the opponent to block the net. However, all members of the team are competent in defense and have good coordination. The overall team development should not be beaten passively. Unfortunately, the Taiwan team members took the wins and losses too seriously, and were unable to respond calmly. Occasional errors led to mutual accusations, resulting in panic after each defeat and repeated mistakes. They lost both games to the Shanghai team.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first game, the Shanghai team scored with a serve, and the team immediately responded. The two sides fought fiercely to a tie, and Shanghai's overwhelming advantage was not yet visible. However, after a 14-14 tie, the Taiwan team felt the pressure from Chen Meizhen, the military was panicked, and made many mistakes, resulting in no progress after 14 points and losing the first game. At the beginning of the second game, Taiwan lost confidence, and the front and middle rows of the Shanghai team took the opportunity to make major kills, and relied on the brilliant result of 21-10 to overwhelm Taiwan. The lineups of the two teams are attached below:</p>
<p>Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhu Jinyun Chen Meizhen Wang Shan</p>
<p>Chen Liuzhen Wang Weizhen Huang Mingyuan</p>
<p>Xiang Yulin Chen Jieshu Jiang Zhaoshan</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>Luo Ni Sun Jinxi Yan Xiuying</p>
<p>Yang Yu'er Jiang Guizhi Chen Meiyu</p>
<p>Gao Jingya Zhang Yuese Chen Huaguang</p>
<p>Hunan Daughters' Army Overwhelms Guangzhou</p>
<p>The Hunan Daughters' Army, which previously defeated the Zhejiang team, crushed the Guangzhou team yesterday with an absolute overwhelming advantage.</p>
<p>Chen Peikun of the Hunan team spiked wonderfully, comparable to Chen Meizhen of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The physical strength and combat skills of the Guangzhou team members are poor. The previous match against Henan was already extremely difficult to win. This time, when they met the Hunan Iron Army, they naturally could not resist. Therefore, at the beginning of the first game, when the Hunan team scored 13 consecutive points, Guangzhou was still blank. In the end, the Hunan team easily won the first game with a disparity of 21-3. In the second game, although the Guangzhou team tried its best to counterattack, it was fortunately tied at 19-19, but still gave up defense.</p>
<p>The lineups of the two teams are attached below:</p>
<p>Hunan</p>
<p>Zheng Peiji Liu Xingheng Zheng Peikun</p>

<p>Police Wins Against Fujian The strengths of the Police and Fujian were comparable, so it was difficult to distinguish between them. Fujian was finally eliminated by one point due to slightly less experience. The seven-inning record is as follows:</p>
<p>Taiwan Defeats United Logistics Taiwan is the most vocal team to win the championship. Defeating United Logistics is like hitting a stone with an egg, and it was easy to win. The records of each inning are listed:</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Last night's boxing at the Municipal Stadium originally had two middleweight semi-finals. However, Guangdong's Xu Dawei was injured in the foot and announced his retirement. Therefore, only the battle between Li Dongfen (Hong Kong) and Yang Jinlai (Guangdong) remained. Also, because Guangdong believed that Li Dongfen's reported weight was incorrect, they insisted on weighing on the spot, which led to a stalemate. The moderator tried his best to mediate before reluctantly resolving the situation. The game started at 8:45 PM. Li Dongfen was more burly, but not as agile as Yang Jinlai, so he was at a disadvantage. In the second round, he was knocked down four times. Although he persisted to the end, he was judged to have lost due to insufficient points compared to Yang Jinlai. Yang will compete with Shanghai's Li Kai the night after tomorrow (12th) for the middleweight championship.</p>
<p>In the other two light-welterweight matches, Shanghai's Fei Miaolong defeated Taiwan's Hong Caitian by one point, and Shanghai's Huang Zengxiu defeated Hubei's Chen Keqiang (points 26 to 20).

<p>Spectators Break Through Erdao Defense Line</p>
<p>Military Police and Boy Scouts Sweat Profusely</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the weather after the solar eclipse was partly cloudy and partly sunny. More people came to visit the sports meet than on the first day, and we really saw a "sea of people" at this time.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, the entire venue was full. Spectators gathered outside the venue. Although the military police prevented them from entering, at 11:40 AM, the defense lines at the two entrances were broken, and the crowd poured into the venue. Then the military police and Boy Scouts built a second defense line to prevent spectators from entering the track, but it was soon broken again, and the order was greatly disrupted.</p>
<p>Near the entrances and exits on each stand, the crowd was surging, pushing and squeezing each other, in a chaotic mess. Later, the crowd rushed down the railing, crossed the bamboo fence, and even rushed into the track and field. The competition was therefore declared to be suspended twice. The military police, flying fortresses, and Boy Scouts were exhausted and sweating profusely.</p>
<p>The loudspeaker said at one moment: "If the audience does not leave the venue, the competition will be stopped immediately." At another moment, it desperately said hello. Such a combination of soft and hard tactics gradually made the audience leave the venue, which had a small effect.</p>
<p>Thinking of the order of the 6th National Games, when Chen was booed off the field, it really makes people sigh that the Chinese people have regressed even on this point.</p>
<p>The weather was not good, and it started to rain again around 5:00 PM, sometimes heavy and sometimes light. White newspapers were used as rain hats. Speculators outside the venue were selling small paper umbrellas, and each one was priced at 130,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shen Xiqing, the leader of the Henan wrestling team, gave a speech to the surrounding audience angrily because the conference did not allow them to participate in wrestling: "We have already received the announcement cloth, but our names are not on the list. What are we doing from the opening to rush over?" Finally, he asked the conference to allow Henan players to have a performance match with the champions of each group at least once. Two people fainted in the venue today: an old man's abdomen was pressed against the railing and almost died. (Education)</p>

<h3 id="e105">Tennis Singles and Doubles Have Disparate Strengths; Liao Yifang Resists Tao Champion; Gan Zaichuan Is Good at Old Man's Ball; Men's and Women's Singles Semi-Finals Continue Today <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Only one men's doubles tennis match was played yesterday, with police officers Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng against Zhejiang's Zhong Shibao and Sun Chuanxin. Tao and Wang won very easily. The remaining games were changed to the second round of men's singles and the first round of women's singles.</p>
<p>The women's singles competition was mediocre. Shanghai's Zhang Zhiying, Malaysia's Chen Junyu, Lu Yuanchun, Indonesia's Chen Jinshi, Zhang Meishan, and Guangzhou's Luo Qiaoer all advanced. Chen Jinshi is the strongest of all the players. Today's semi-finals will continue to compete for the finals.</p>
<p>A total of ten men's singles matches were played yesterday, one of which was a qualifying match, in which Guizhou's Wen Ling easily defeated Jiangxi's Yin Shoumin.</p>
<p>In the championship, Shanghai's Chen Yi won against Li Wenxuan (Indonesia) in the morning, but lost to Malaysia's Ruan Guolin in the afternoon. However, Mr. Ruan will meet Tao Guanqiu (police) today, and it may be difficult to win. Yesterday's battle between Tao Guanqiu and Liao Yifang (Guangzhou) was the most exciting. Mr. Liao's backhand draw was very powerful, resisting Tao Guanqiu and winning a lot of applause. Indonesia's Chen Lichao won against Xu Runpei (Hong Kong) yesterday, and will face Ye Guanxiong (Guangzhou) today; Judging from yesterday's competition, it may not be easy for Mr. Ye to win. However, there must be many exciting things in the game between the two sides. Wang Wenzheng (police) did not seem to have any trouble winning against Mei Jiesheng (Tan). Gan Zaichuan (Taiwan)'s old man's ball caused Zhou Guanjun (Shanghai) a lot of trouble, and he kept complaining. The advanced men will continue the semi-finals today.</p>

<h3 id="e106">A Wave of Prices Rising in a Straight Line; The Periodic Price Increase Storm Begins Again <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The general price level this year once set off a wave of price increases in the second week of March after the Lunar New Year, and then turned silent. Until the end of April, it hovered and advanced in this stable state. However, in recent months, the money supply has been relaxed, the unofficial interest rate has fallen below the ground, and the market is full of dangers. The new wave of price increases was about to break out, but due to the gradual realization of US loans and the imminent issuance of short-term treasury bills, there were many concerns, resulting in a state of wanting to rise but stopping. Until last week, treasury bills have been launched, but the effect is not ideal. Although US aid has developed to a considerable stage, the arrival of materials is still pending. Therefore, under this already mature environment, the general price level broke the silent state of recent months and showed a trend of rising in a straight line. From the beginning of the week to the weekend, the waves were turbulent, and the firmness was unusually high, indicating that a new periodic price increase storm has begun. Judging from the wholesale price index compiled by this journal last week, it increased by 9.21%. (Due to the time relationship, the index compiled by this journal only includes data up to Thursday, and the price fluctuations on Friday and Saturday cannot be fully expressed.) The new wave of price increases last week was led by financial commodities, followed by the goods market, mutually supporting each other, and the market price gradually increased. The money supply is still very loose. Except for a slight tightening on the weekend, the National Bank's exchange has not much difference, and on Wednesday, it made a difference of more than 150 billion. The unofficial interest rate hovered between 24% and 27%. There are many factors that caused this price increase storm. The more important ones are briefly analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>First, since Mr. Bei Zuyi returned to China from the United States, rumors of opening up foreign exchange have been rampant. Because the current foreign exchange policy cannot stimulate exports and has no power to supply imports, it is really necessary to change course. Now that US loans have been successful, the general opinion is that the time for reform has come. Once foreign exchange is opened, the government will no longer supply the foreign exchange quotas required by the industrial and commercial sectors in the future, even the small amount at present, and they must find ways in the market themselves. Therefore, the US dollar will be in a state of more demand than supply. The news is good, and the trend of rising prices is closely related to this. Gold, stocks, and even other prices, which are closely related to this, have also followed the rise. Until Thursday, the authorities solemnly denied opening up foreign exchange, but the prairie fire has become a reality and cannot be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>Second, the People's Food Allocation Committee announced an increase in the price of household rice in May. According to the allocation of household rice in April, the amount was 15.6 jin, and the price was 110,000 yuan. In May, the allocation was reduced to 15 jin, and the price was increased to 350,000 yuan. The market price of rice has been flat for a long time, and it took the opportunity to rise. In addition, frequent reports of rising rice prices in the producing areas are also the main reason for stimulating the rise in rice prices in Shanghai. For example, Wuxi white rice increased from 4.15 million at the end of the previous week to 5.256 million on Friday. The Wuhu rice market increased by 600,000 to 700,000 per stone from Tuesday to Thursday. The special machine reached 3.6 million on Thursday, the rough rice was 4.3 million, and the clean rice was 3.9 million.</p>
<p>Third, idle funds have no proper outlet. In recent months, due to the suspension of deferred settlement of securities trading, the National Treasury's payment of various matured price coupons, the large amount of expenditure, and the continuous flow of funds from Northeast China to the south, Shanghai has been flooded with abnormal amounts of idle funds. Judging from the National Bank's exchange situation, there have been repeated differences, and the unofficial interest rate has always hovered at a low level, which can be seen. According to estimates, the recent amount of idle funds in Shanghai should be more than 10 trillion. Short-term treasury bills, an important tool specially designed by the National Bank to absorb funds, have already been launched. However, the shortest period of treasury bills is one month. Calculated based on the issue date of 87.3% discount plus a monthly interest rate of 5%, the total monthly interest rate is no more than 20%. Although it was raised to 84.5% on Tuesday, the total interest is only 24% per month, which has little control over the market funds, but makes speculators feel a sense of fear that had previously existed. Therefore, a large amount of idle funds rushed to the financial and commodity markets, causing a price increase storm.</p>
<p>Fourth, in recent months, factories have been moving south, and funds have been flowing south at an increasing rate. Recently, there is no suitable industry or commerce in Guangzhou, South China, to invest in. The only place to escape is Hong Kong, forming an abnormal development of urgent demand for Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, the Hong Kong exchange rate has repeatedly shrunk sharply. It is estimated that the exchange rate of 1 million legal currencies was 6.7 yuan per Hong Kong dollar at the end of the previous week, shrinking to 4.8 yuan per Hong Kong dollar on Friday of last week. Since the Hong Kong exchange rate has shrunk so sharply, gold, banknotes, and general financial commodities in Shanghai have also risen sharply like shadows. Regarding the economic problems between China and Hong Kong, unreasonable phenomena have emerged one after another. The current situation has entered such a serious stage. The authorities should no longer follow the old ways and need to seek appropriate countermeasures as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fifth, prices in Shanghai have been stable for a considerable period of time. The money supply has always been loose, and the National Bank has been unable to tighten it. In addition, the cost of living index for employees and public education personnel published by the competent authorities in April has increased. At the same time, the National Congress closed, and most of the representatives took the opportunity to come to Shanghai. The National Games also opened at this time, and athletes from all over the country gathered in Shanghai, and consumption increased. Various direct and indirect reasons are complex and countless, resulting in this inevitable major price increase storm.</p>
<p>The new measures related to prices last week that can be described are: First, the foreign exchange rate has not been adjusted for a long time, and the difference between the black market exchange rate is too great. The license can be exchanged at the current exchange rate, but after the imported goods arrive, the price in North Africa is calculated according to the exchange rate cost. In order to eliminate this unreasonable phenomenon, it is stipulated that when importers receive the notice of the import license, they will first pay 50% of the guarantee deposit in domestic currency according to the exchange rate at that time. When the goods arrive, they will be exchanged at the then price. This measure, in terms of the current foreign exchange policy that has fallen into the bureau, is still a way to treat the head when the head is itchy.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the development of US aid issues, the Executive Yuan approved the establishment of the US Aid Utilization Committee at the Yuan meeting on Tuesday. The Executive Yuan President will preside over the committee, which will have 13 members, and the director of the committee will appoint three members as standing committee members to assist in the special meeting affairs. There will also be one secretary-general and one deputy secretary-general, responsible for handling the vehicle affairs. It is heard that the distribution of various US aid materials in the future will still be handled through the allocation method.</p>
<p>Third, last week, the heads of the Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Wuhan financial management bureaus went to Beijing together and suggested to the financial authorities to abolish domestic exchange restrictions and relax controls. Whether they can be implemented remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Under the stimulation of the various bullish factors mentioned above last week, the market situation was strong and many unprecedented high prices were created.</p>
<p>In the Chinese stock market, the stock king Yongsha once broke the 3,000 yuan mark. Jingfu, Xinyi, Business, and other varieties have also repeatedly reached the limit. The trend of foreign stocks is more than that of Chinese stocks.</p>
<p>In terms of cloth, the prices outside the circle are high, and there are rumors in the market that the inventory of textiles is not much. The rising trend is in a straight line. For example, 42 branches of Jianfeng closed at 242 million at the end of the previous week, and broke the 300 million mark at the end of last week. The 21 branches of Double Horse also increased from 170 million at the end of the previous week to 210 million on Friday of last week. The head fine cloth also rose in price, reaching a peak of 6.32 million on Friday.</p>
<p>Due to the price increase of the People's Food Allocation Committee and the price increase in production areas, the price of white rice in the north and south markets has generally increased by about 800,000 to 900,000 in the past week. Coarse grains and edible oil have also risen. Flour is selling well in the north. For example, the price of Bingshan No. 1 flour increased from 1.42 million at the end of the previous week to 1.8 million at the weekend. Edible grains are selling better due to seasonal reasons, and the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar is constantly being adjusted. It is estimated that 1.5 yuan of Taiwan dollars is equivalent to 278 yuan of legal currency, 288 yuan on the 6th, and 302 yuan on the 7th. For example, the price of sugar at the weekend has exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark. Other daily necessities, chemicals, building materials, etc., have all risen, creating a huge wave.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Currency and Finance <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>(1) Money Supply and Hot Money</p>
<p>Last week, the money supply in this city continued its previous trend, showing an extremely loose situation. The price surge in May was very intense, with financial items experiencing even more frantic increases. Although demand from all parties was very keen, due to the accumulation of hot money and abundant supply sources, there was no sign of tightening in the loose money situation for the time being. Market interest rates were between 24 and 25.5 cents on Monday of last week. Although they briefly rose to 27 cents and even 28.5 cents on Wednesday and Thursday, they fell back to 24 cents on Friday, indicating the generally ample funds. According to reports, a financial industry insider stated that the reserve of hot money in this city is very substantial, unofficially estimated to be as high as ten trillion yuan. It is said that the reason why hot money is so rampant is due to the influence of the following factors:</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural loans from various places have flowed into the cities, resulting in an unusually abundant supply of cash chips in this city. (2) Government and bank expenditures are enormous. (3) Few people are purchasing short-term treasury bills, and the authorities have no effective methods to tighten the money supply. (4) The principal and interest on the 27th, 29th, and 31st year U.S. dollar bonds are due. (5) The arrival of National Assembly representatives and athletes from various places in Shanghai inevitably increases some extra purchasing power. (6) According to reports, the frantic rise in the black market for gold and banknotes is due to purchases by certain prominent figures.</p>
<p>The inability of underground interest rates to rise is sufficient to indicate that the loose money supply will have to be maintained for some time. The enormous expenditures of the national treasury can also be seen in the exchange differences of national banks. From Monday to Friday, national banks showed a surplus of 842.8 billion yuan due to income from sugar and yarn, but this number also includes large fixed deposits of commercial banks in national banks. Therefore, after deducting this, national banks had a real deficit almost every day, with a net deficit of 1,072 billion yuan in five days, which significantly impacted the ample funds in the market. On the banking side, both promissory notes and cash are exceptionally abundant, interbank lending is almost at a standstill, and the amount of cash handed over to national banks every day is also above 50 to 60 billion yuan, which shows the substantial cash reserves. After the No. 60 exchange results, from Monday to Friday, the deficit totaled more than 690 billion yuan, which also included a surplus of 22 billion yuan on Friday.</p>
<p>The exchange results of foreign banks showed that the surplus on Wednesday set a new record, reaching 327.8 billion yuan, and the deficit of 72.2 billion yuan on Friday was also rare since February. In total, the surplus in five days was 483 billion yuan, a significant decrease from the previous week.</p>
<p>(2) Internal and External Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the benchmark exchange rate for foreign exchange remained unchanged, but the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank sharply. On Monday, 100,000 legal tender yuan could be exchanged for 67 cents in Hong Kong dollars, but by Friday, it had shrunk to 48 cents, a decrease of one-third, which can be described as drastic. The highest price for Hong Kong U.S. dollar forward contracts was 5.69 yuan on Monday, and the lowest was 5.53 yuan on Friday. The market price of U.S. dollars was 5.60 Hong Kong dollars on Monday and also shrank to 5.44 Hong Kong dollars on Friday. The price of gold was 333 yuan per tael on Monday, which gradually decreased to 329 yuan on Thursday, but suddenly increased to 340 yuan on Friday.</p>
<p>Last week, the exchange rate for Guangzhou remittance gradually increased. It was 80 yuan on Monday and had gradually increased to 140 yuan by Friday. The trend of the Xiamen exchange rate was roughly the same. It was 100 yuan on Monday, and although it once decreased to 80 yuan on Tuesday, it immediately increased afterward, reaching 120 yuan by Friday, reflecting the trend of funds flowing south again. The Chongqing exchange rate was at par on Monday, changed to a discount of 10 yuan on Tuesday, and the discount was 20 yuan from Wednesday to Friday. The Hankou exchange rate also increased, from par on Monday to 40 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin exchange rate remained unchanged during the week, maintaining a discount level of 50 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of this week, the Hong Kong exchange rate was reported to be tightening again, and the rumor of the opening up of foreign stocks was about to be implemented. This was obviously beneficial to the stock market, and people felt encouraged. Wing On Company was the first to advance, reaching a new high price of 2325 yuan, and other stocks also rose strongly. American Asiatic Company reached 4250, Tung Yick Company 621, and China Flour Mill 72, all reaching the upper limit of price increases. On Tuesday, due to the influx of hot money and the loose money supply, the trend turned upward again. Wing On Company approached the 2500 yuan mark, and all stocks showed a steady upward trend throughout the day. China Flour Mill reached the upper limit of price increases again, closing at 86.4. China Cement closed at 920, and Heng Fung at 471.5, also reaching the upper limit. On Wednesday, it was suddenly rumored that the Northeast circulating coupons could be exchanged upon entering the pass. Wing On Company showed even more brilliance, once reaching a new high price of 2650 yuan, showing unique color, and the trading volume was also the highest. The situation of other stocks fluctuated. The stock market on Thursday was in full swing, and the bullish momentum became more and more magnificent, actually reporting a full house of red. Wing On Company surpassed the 3800 mark, and 15 kinds such as King Lun Company all reached the upper limit of price increases. The trading volume increased dramatically, reaching 800 million yuan. After four days of continuous increases, waiting until Friday, the money supply still showed a loose trend. Wing On Company took a burst of energy and soared out of the 3,000 yuan mark, reaching a new high of 3025. Old bulls took profits at high prices and finally closed their positions. The table suddenly showed tension, and a sudden plunge occurred, falling sharply to 2830 yuan, closing at the lowest price of the day. Other stocks also fell one after another.</p>
<p>Due to the further contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate and the soaring prices of financial items, Jardine Matheson rose to 3.93 million yuan, Union Insurance to 4.3 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden to 8.1 million yuan, all higher than before. On Tuesday, due to the crazy rise in the black market for financial commodities, foreign stocks also saw a straight-line rise. Wheelock Marden rose sharply by 70 million yuan compared to before, and Jardine Matheson and Union Insurance each rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Others such as Shanghai Brewery at 880,000, China Merchants at 460,000, and Shanghai Dockyards at 930,000, all rose. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank again, and the rising momentum became even more intense. Wheelock Marden rose by another 800,000 yuan, shouting 9.6 million yuan, approaching the 10 million mark. Union Insurance reached 5 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson 4.44 million yuan. On Thursday, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to shrink, and since foreign stocks are denominated in Hong Kong dollars, it caused foreign stocks to continue to rise sharply. Jardine Matheson saw a high price of 4.78 million yuan, Union Insurance 5.8 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden reached the 10 million yuan mark. On Friday, it climbed to a new peak. Jardine Matheson once rose to 5.15 million yuan, and then it was heard that Chinese stocks had fallen, falling back to 5.06 million yuan; Union Insurance reached 6.05 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden crossed the 10 million mark, soaring to 11.8 million yuan. Shanghai Brewery shouted 1.04 million, Shanghai Dockyards 1.15 million, and China Merchants 520,000, all rising higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Sales to the South Face Multiple Challenges, Future Remains Difficult to be Optimistic About</p>
<p>Although the transportation of cotton cloth to the south has been opened, the sales performance of various textile products to the south has not been very good. According to the cotton cloth dyeing and weaving industry, since the ban on transporting cotton cloth to the south in this city was lifted, people in the industry have been thinking about rushing to transport a large number of cotton cloths to the south in an attempt to make profits, but recently the market conditions in Hong Kong and Macao have been sluggish. Although there has been no price inversion, if they are transported from Shanghai, plus transportation costs, water freight, tariffs, and discount interest, labor, and other expenses, not only is it impossible to make a profit, but it is also necessary to suffer losses. Therefore, except for those who have already accepted deposits in the past, very few new transactions are being made, and new textile dyeing and weaving factories are being established in Hong Kong, and production and sales are increasing day by day, giving a huge blow to the sale of Shanghai cotton cloth to the south. As for Siam, the Philippines, Manila, and other places, although the cotton cloth market is still good, the competition from Japanese cotton cloth sales is quite fierce, and the future of our country's cotton cloth sales to the south is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<h3 id="e108">New Treatment for Allergic Asthma <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Lai Houjun</p>
<p>After reading the article "Treatment for Asthma" by a doctor last time, I secretly thought that there are many patients with allergic bronchial asthma in recent years. European and American developed countries have been diligently researching allergic diseases for years. Good results have been achieved in the radical treatment of allergic asthma, and the specific desensitization therapy is used to radically cure asthma. It is not yet common in our country. Furthermore, I was repeatedly urged by friends to write about what I have learned and use various allergens for specific desensitization therapy and make it public to society. I hope to initiate discussion and hope to get guidance from experts in the country, or allow those suffering from this disease to have a deep understanding of it and know that this disease is not an incurable disease as previously thought.</p>
<p>Causes of Allergic Bronchial Asthma</p>
<p>That is, the patient is specifically allergic to one or more substances. When this allergen enters the human body, the reticuloendothelial system produces a sensitizing antibody that combines with the allergen to produce a histamine-like substance, resulting in asthma.</p>
<p>Allergen sources can be divided into two categories:</p>
<p>(1) Allergens produced in the body</p>
<p>For example, tonsillitis, sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, etc. Toxins secreted by pathogens.</p>
<p>(2) External factors</p>
<p>A: Indoor dust, airborne bacteria, pollen, etc.</p>
<p>B: Animal dander, hair, and their secretions, etc.</p>
<p>C: Various foods.</p>
<p>Among them, category A is the most important. It is the allergic factor for each patient. I have seen many patients who, after staying in a place full of dust and heavy gas for a moment, can cause continuous sneezing - the precursor to asthma.</p>
<p>Food allergies are more common in young children. Their allergies decrease with age. Almost all children under four or five years old suffer from food allergies. If their allergens can be detected and avoided, radical cure will be easy. Those who suffer from food allergies often have eczema, pruritus, and chronic indigestion. However, these are nothing more than allergic lesions of the skin and digestive tract.</p>
<p>Dr. Liang has discussed the symptoms in detail, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>(1) Specific therapy (radical cure)</p>
<p>A. Avoidance method</p>
<p>This method is the most reliable. If you can completely avoid contact with allergens, you will not relapse. After a few years, the sensitivity to that allergen can be reduced.</p>
<p>For patients who are allergic to dust and pollen inhaled into the respiratory tract, an electric dust remover produced in the United States can be used to remove dust from the room. Then the asthma can be completely stopped within ten minutes. There are also specially made masks that can filter allergens in the air. This mask can be used during work or sleep.</p>
<p>The patient's bedroom should be high, airy, and full of sunlight. The furniture should be simple and clean. The pillows and mattresses should be lined with rubber cloth to prevent dust from spreading. Animals and insects should not be kept indoors.</p>
<p>B. Specific desensitization therapy</p>
<p>This method has been used in Europe and the United States for 50 years. Only the method of extracting allergens is not very accurate, so the effect is not as good as ideal. Since 1936, American experts studying this disease have made contributions every year, and there have also been inventions in pathology. Therefore, desensitization therapy for allergic diseases is as widely used as penicillin for suppurative diseases.</p>
<p>The method is: use various allergens to first make an intradermal test to detect which allergens the patient reacts to. After that, use each of these allergens for desensitization therapy. As for technical issues, considerable experience is required, otherwise it can promote the onset of the disease. This therapy takes a considerable amount of time, about half a year to a year, to have satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Some people think that there are many kinds of allergens, which are difficult to test. In fact, there are several principles to follow. The most common allergens are only sixty or seventy kinds. And each patient has only four or five kinds of allergens. It is not as complicated as imagined. However, various laboratory tests are still needed to assist in treatment.</p>
<p>For those whose asthma is caused by local lesions in the upper respiratory tract, surgical operations and vaccine injections are used to treat them.</p>
<p>(2) Symptomatic treatment</p>
<p>It is also very important. It can not only alleviate the patient's pain during attacks and shorten their course but also an important assistance during the radical cure period. However, various drugs have their side effects. A small dose is ineffective, and an excessive dose is harmful. Only the doctor can prescribe medication according to the individual's condition. Therefore, I will not discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>Emerging antihistaminic drugs</p>
<p>Such as Benadryl, Pyribenzamine, Thiodiphenylamine derivatives, etc. However, this type of drug is still in the trial period, and its efficacy is very temporary, and it has considerable side effects. But after continuous research and reform by experts, I think there will be satisfactory efficacy in the near future.</p>
<p>Changing residence for treatment</p>
<p>It is very suitable for patients to move to the mountains.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Hookworm is Still Not Scary <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wang Wanbai's masterpiece "Hookworm Disease, the Enemy of the Countryside" in the 60th issue of this publication a month ago, I was very interested. I am currently a doctor in the Xiangshan Health Experimental Area of the Suzhou Local Disease Prevention and Control Institute. This is a famous endemic area of Japanese schistosomiasis. A few days ago, we examined the health conditions of children in various schools and found that nearly 70% of them were sick. The others are not all strong, and most of them are malnourished and underdeveloped. The diseases are mostly abdominal pain, bloody stools, accompanied by trachoma, stomatitis, otitis media, dental caries, skin diseases... If children in all schools across the country are mostly going to school with diseases like this, the future masters of the country will be so unhealthy, what future does the Republic of China have!</p>
<p>According to the examination of the feces of 184 school-age children in this area last year, as many as 144 people suffered from intestinal parasitic diseases, including Japanese schistosomiasis, ginger fluke, roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, etc. Because the students' parents are farmers, most of them do not know hygiene, and drinking raw water when thirsty has become a habit. All kinds of pollutants are thrown into the river, the toilet buckets are washed in the river, and water is also taken from the river. In places where there are already intestinal parasitic diseases, intestinal parasitic diseases are naturally prevalent. Originally, intestinal parasitic diseases were not serious. If the deworming treatment is reasonable, the patient's body can be relieved and health can be restored. Only Japanese schistosomiasis is the real enemy of the countryside today. Because once infected, there is no specific medicine today. Injecting Fuacin can only kill its male worms, and the female worms are not affected at all. It can only temporarily stop the disease, but it cannot cure the patient. As for the 2% potassium antimony tartrate solution, start with half a cc and inject it intravenously, adding half a cc every day until it reaches five cc on the tenth day and stop. In this disease, after the liver and spleen are enlarged, it is not only ineffective, but also has a fatal danger.</p>
<p>Hookworm, originally named: Anchylostomiasis, that is, duodenal worm, has four hook teeth on its mouth, bites the intestinal mucosa, and takes the host's nutrients for life. It does not "suck human blood" as Wang said. If they directly suck human blood, they can survive everywhere in people's liver, lungs, and other internal organs. Imagine what way out hookworm patients have? The circulatory system, lungs, liver, etc. are only the paths they invade, and the small intestine is their growth place. Because they must rely on the nutrients in the small intestine to survive, although their eggs are small, they are not as small as bacteria, so they can be clearly seen under a microscope at more than 100 times: oval-shaped eggs, thin, colorless shells, with four egg bacteria inside. Like welcoming a pair of dumbbell shapes, there are also deformed ones, with only two egg cells. The nails of patients with this disease are pale red or pale yellow, thin and fragile, the tips are easy to crack, and the surface is uneven, turning towards the back of the finger, which is its characteristic. Patients like foreign objects. After the disease is cured, most of them are normal. The earlier the deworming, the faster the recovery. But in the late stage, when there is edema and a tendency to bleed, deworming drugs are difficult to use, and the prognosis is often poor.</p>
<p>Reasonable deworming therapy: (You must first test the stool)</p>
<p>(1) Take Mag Sulfuric 20.0 before going to bed</p>
<p>(2) Take Oil Chenopod 20-30 drops in capsules or starch paper for easy administration on an empty stomach the next morning.</p>
<p>(3) Two hours after taking the above medicine, take Mag Sulfuric 20.0 again</p>
<p>Repeat it every other day or continuously until the stool does not find the eggs of this worm. Children under the age of fifteen can use 0.03 cc per year of age, but if this medicine stays in the intestine for a long time, it is easy to cause symptoms of poisoning such as numbness, spasms, tinnitus, and deafness. Patients with heart and kidney disease are particularly prone to poisoning and should pay attention to administration. Mr. Wang advocates using a total of fifteen drops of this medicine, divided into three doses and taken three hours apart. I think: the dosage is too small. According to the regulations, 20 drops should be the starting dose, and it can be used up to 35 drops. Mr. Wang also advocates taking it again in two weeks to eradicate the roots. In fact, it is also impossible. If you are afraid of side effects, severe heart and kidney diseases cannot be used at all. I wonder if Mr. Wang thinks so? The air is fresh, the climate is high and cool, and the temperature changes are not drastic. Humid weather and large cities with frequent heavy fog are not suitable for asthma patients to live in.</p>
<p>Prognosis</p>
<p>After the allergen is detected, contact should be completely avoided. And use special desensitization therapy, which is very effective. Most patients can be completely cured.</p>
<p>According to recent American medical journals, statistics from American hospitals show that allergic diseases account for about 20%-30%. It mostly occurs in childhood, or first suffers from eczema, pruritus, and then asthma. Young children often suffer from insufficient breast milk, supplemented with milk cake, and additional sugar feeding. This kind of incompletely digested protein and polysaccharide molecules can enter the underdeveloped intestinal wall of children, produce allergic symptoms, and cause the intestinal wall to degenerate. After that, they are easily sensitive to food. Therefore, infants should not be given hard food before six months of age. Human milk should be the main food, otherwise it should be replaced with cow's milk. Don't save money and leave infants with diseases.</p>

<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>I wrote an article "A Good Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis" before, mentioning "Ebesal" ("Bayer") (see this publication on April 30). I originally wanted to contribute a fool's opinion to stimulate discussion among colleagues. Indeed, this is not yet a specific medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis, but just an auxiliary agent such as calcium injections. It only promotes the calcification of lesions. Dr. Liang Junqing's annotation "The side effects are very large, do not use it indiscriminately without the help of an expert" is also a fact. Unexpectedly, patients have sent letters asking questions one after another, and they are all forwarded by the Medical Association. There are several cases every day. Although those who inquire all enclose postage, some have unknown mailing addresses and cannot be replied to. Now I will answer them all here together. If subsequent people want to ask questions in person, please send them directly to my clinic at No. 13, Lane 364, Xinhua Road (23) in this city, or collect them from the second floor of the Zhongxi Pharmacy at No. 676 Kangding Road (intersection of Changde Road) between 10 am and 12 noon.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Way to Use Money <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>When Chinese people write articles, their minds are very clear and complex, such as the principles of "to capture first, to coax and flatter," "to suppress before praising," and "to apply powder to the back" are truly "ancient," and are used very skillfully and beautifully, so they left us descendants so many masterpieces that sound like gold and stone when thrown. Unfortunately, those who can speak may not be able to act, especially when it comes to using money, it seems that they do not understand the method at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter if the article is poorly written, at least there will be no disaster. As for using money, there are many troubles and problems. The reason is that money is something that everyone needs to use. Those who know how to use it will not only benefit themselves but also prevent others from being exhausted because of you, which is what the Japanese devils often said, "coexistence and co-prosperity." Those who don't know how to use it, on the surface, seem to enjoy themselves very much, but every enjoyment deprives some people of some vitality. As time goes by, it will definitely turn into great hatred, which is the biggest source of all turmoil and unrest.</p>
<p>Confucianism only gives people extremely general lessons, saying what "gentlemen understand righteousness, villains understand profit." So "Zi rarely speaks of profit," and Mencius even criticized King Hui of Liang because of this. In fact, how can profit be rarely mentioned, and how can nourishing be compared? Isn't this completely empty talk? Reading this kind of teaching too much will definitely turn people into hypocrites. On the surface, they don't talk about money, but in their bones, they pounce on money. Today's corrupt officials will all talk about a set of benevolence and righteousness, and I am afraid they are all trained by the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. As for Taoism, that's even worse. They only know that money is the source of all evil, and advocate "not seeing what is desirable, so that the heart will not be disturbed," and say "five colors make people's eyes blind, five sounds make people's ears deaf, and five flavors make people's mouths refreshed." This is like "there is no silver buried here," the more you say it, the more you steal. Since society already has money, and money can buy everything, unless the whole world has a thorough revolution against money, otherwise, if you want to deny its existence in an Ah Q-style way, it will never succeed.</p>
<p>But Confucianism has the saying "a brave man cuts off his wrist when a viper bites his hand." To remove a limb to save the whole body, weighing the gains and losses, is ultimately worth it. Although the body, hair, and skin are received from parents and should not be damaged, at this time you can't talk too much. The body is like this, why not use money? Chinese people—especially wealthy Chinese people—rarely think about this. Sometimes, for the sake of their concubine's illness, or their own syphilis and diabetes, their son's smallpox and typhoid fever, they make vows and donate a certain number of cotton clothes in winter, or benefit monks and Taoists, and perform a complete water and land ceremony, as if they are the greatest of great compassion Amitabha Buddha, but the birth, old age, sickness, and death of his concubine and young master and even himself are not controlled by others. If the old man in the sky also flatters the rich, and insists on not letting him get sick, are the poor waiting to freeze to death and starve to death? Therefore, even in terms of selfishness and self-interest, this has fallen to the lowest level, not to mention that most people will cancel this little charity under the slogan of "breaking superstition"? A friend once made a comparison, he said, for example, there are five cups of tea, and ten people are all thirsty and want to drink. Naturally, those who are quick and powerful will grab them. In foreign countries, one person may drink two cups, and the remaining three cups are divided among nine people, one cup for three people. Although it is not quenching their thirst, it can also generate saliva. But in China, it is not like this. One person drinks three cups in a row, and although I don't drink the rest, others don't want it, and it is poured on the ground and becomes mud! I think this comparison is very appropriate. To give an example of Shanghai alone, I don't know how much clean water is poured on the ground every day and turned into mud, while most people are dying of thirst there, but no one cares. Can this last?</p>
<p>We have seen American oil tycoons and steel tycoons donate millions to social undertakings without stinginess. Many Chinese people must be secretly scolding them as fools, "If I had so much money, I wouldn't do this!" But in fact, the Rockefeller and Carnegie families have never become poor because of these donations. On the contrary, their careers and safety are more firmly guaranteed because of this. This is the expression of Europeans and Americans using money better than we do. It must be known that within a country, if so-called wealthy families can have such a long-term vision, several worries will disappear into nothing, and revolution and bloodshed will be useless. I always feel that revolution is a last resort for mankind, and even revolutionaries themselves will not be proud of it. Why can social policy replace social revolution in other countries, but not in China? Those who have money should think about this.</p>
<p>When I was young, I read Tao Yuanming's letters to his son Yanzhi and others, teaching his son to treat servants well, "This is also a child, and should be treated kindly." This is very admirable. Thinking about it today, the Chinese family seems to take mistreating servants as the principle, and treating servants as "people" as the exception. From Tao Gong's words, it reflects the bastardness of all intellectuals! Because there is absolutely no rule in the world that "servants must not be treated as people," then Tao Gong's letter is not worth mentioning! However, today's rich people are taking giving away a few cotton clothes as a merit, but forgetting that this is a true self-interest. If even this self-interest cannot deeply understand the truth and make it more effective and profound, then their personal tragedy is inevitable!</p>
<h3 id="e112">Grand Assembly Exercise <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>On the three sides of the stands, looking over, they were high and low, wriggling and moving, all heads, countless. Even with good eyesight, I am afraid you would not be able to count them all. What men, women, old, young, tall, short, closer ones could be vaguely distinguished, but the distant corners could not be clearly distinguished. As far as the eye could see, one only knew that those wriggling things were heads. Those people naturally also included some standing and some walking, but looking over, one could not distinguish them clearly. And who could tell whether there were relatives and friends of mine in this ant-like crowd?</p>
<p>In the sports field, the athletes from various places, amidst the colorful flags, orderly divided into two wings and withdrew. The field was instantly empty, leaving only a group of Shanghai middle school students directly in front of the podium. How many people there were could not be counted; whether they were male or female could not be seen clearly. Looking over, all that could be seen were white hats on their heads, white shirts on their upper bodies, blue shorts on their lower bodies, and white canvas shoes on their feet. White, blue, white, all the same color, without exception. They hid in the corner of the square, as if waiting quietly for something.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a command from the podium, the magnificent scene unfolded. Unhurried and unhurried, both orderly and neat, ten thousand legs lifted in unison, moving forward, forward, straight to the front of the podium. A large area of the square was instantly filled with countless energetic youths. When they marched, it was said to be like a tide, but not quite, because when the tide rises, the back waves push the front waves, not so lightly and quickly, but turbulent. When they stood still, it was said to be like stars scattered across the sky, but not quite, because how could the scattering of stars and the arrangement of chess pieces be so neat and orderly? With difficulty, one could only say that it was like a large carpet with a patterned blue and white design slowly unfolding on the field, until it covered the entire area.</p>
<p>The music sounded, and the grand assembly exercise began. White hats, white shoes, white shirts, and blue shorts, as if possessing souls, moved in unison with the melody of the music, moving lightly and neatly. At this time, the heads in the stands no longer wriggled; the ten thousand hands raised on the field, the sections of red lotus root protruding from the white hats, dazzled the eyes! One moment, ten thousand palms struck in unison, and the sound was like thousands of pieces of silk being torn at the same time, emitting such a crisp sound! Another moment, they bent down, rising and falling with the cadence of the music, again dazzling the eyes. This could be compared to the vast square being a sea, and at this time it was calm and sunny, and the rising and falling were the light waves on the sea, and only light waves could be said, not turbulent waves!</p>
<p>The music rose and fell, fast and slow, the movements turned with measure. Suddenly the music stopped, and an uncountable number of white hats, white shoes, white shirts, and blue shorts, a group of energetic youths, stood still on the field. Then the audience in the stands let out a breath, and then wriggled and moved, and the applause around them was like the thunder of spring, and even if you had the strength of ten thousand jun, you could not stop it. I was so moved that I was about to cry!</p>

<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to visit a free night school for the public, which several young friends were working hard to support. To be honest, I am most opposed to visits of this kind, because during a visit, not only do those being visited feel uneasy, but the visitors being led around by the administrative officer and the chief officer also feel ashamed for having invaded the natural lives of others. Moreover, after touring around like one casually viewing flowers, apart from the cleanliness of the toilets and the charts on the walls being clear at a glance, it is difficult to obtain any other results. As usual, it is just a perfunctory "very good" and "thank you."</p>
<p>I know the efforts of these young friends very well, but the result of a hurried visit is that one cannot see even a fraction of their achievements, because I understand that they do not yet know how to decorate the façade, such as making the students bow at a full ninety degrees, etc. But just based on this superficial observation, I have seen to some extent that the patriarchal ideas of the poor people in this big city are still stubbornly present and very firmly entrenched.</p>
<p>Each classroom probably has forty students, but I can guarantee that at least thirty or so of them are girls. This specifically illustrates how this generation of parents still discriminates against girls, or at least does not regard them as having the same right to education as boys. I took the opportunity to secretly ask a younger girl about her family situation. She told me shyly that one of her younger brothers had been sent to a nearby elementary school, while she had not finished the third grade before transferring to this free night school. I understand the parents' difficulties, and what surprises me is that even the girl, who is only thirteen or fourteen years old, seems to understand them very well. She said precociously: "It is right for my younger brother to study. I am lucky to be able to study at the night school. When my older sister was my age, she had already gone to work in a cigarette factory."</p>

<p>The prolific writer Sinclair, when studying at university, wrote 8,000 words for magazines every night, and during the day he still had to attend lectures for eight hours.</p>
<p>He once abandoned an income of seventy yuan per issue and ran to the Jesse region to set up a tent, burying himself for five years to complete five novels. Although these five books only sold for a thousand dollars, he didn't care at all.</p>
<p>The famous novelist Nan Geli's masterpiece, "Desert Tradition," was rejected by publishers six times.</p>
<p>His writing attitude is very strict. A novel always takes several months. Whether it is changing the plot or changing the characters' personalities, he is willing to expend great effort.</p>

<p>Teeth fallen, beard gray, taste understood of itself, how can one entrust emotions to spring buds! Wild words are not surprising from Chen Tongfu, he has not understood Shaoling or Jiannan.</p>
<p>River tower lightly drunk, what clearness in the night? One guest silently listens to discussions of war, under the lamp secretly turns over records of places, only saddened that no place has a state's name.</p>
<p>Silently green sky, upright body, above the tower breathing the dust of war, silently white dew flows with sharp edges, stars angry at the people in the lower world.</p>
<p>Lying idly in the wild mountains, too lazy to go out, yesterday followed the flowing water past the former village, the taste of rivers and lakes fades in middle age, even dreams are few, to say nothing of wine stains.</p>
<p>Poetic heart flows and joins as ripples, the land is near but meeting is difficult, but this soul-stirring sky is also drunk, sitting later under Jade Screen Mountain.</p>
<p>Red bookworms scattering after the catastrophe, tablets of the Six Dynasties and writings of the late Qing, the sound of hooves and the shadows of sedan chairs on the Hengtang road, trampling disorderly the clear box, not as good as painting.</p>
<p>Withered grass and long streets, wilderness filling the eyes, cloth shoes frozen and slippery with thick frost, coming to drink Datong wine in the third watch, is not the border pass moon also yellow.</p>
<p>Ten thousand trees arrayed as soldiers, as if they could be waved, floating thunder as drums to embolden the return east, Heaven takes pity on heroic dreams, temporarily allows green mountains to break through in disorder.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Mr. Di Chuqing, whose name was Bao Xian, was from a distinguished family in Liyang. In his youth, he was handsome and forthright. Together with Liu Yang, Tang Caichang, Liang Qichao of Xinhui, and others, he engaged in the reform movement. His creation of the Shibao (Eastern Times) after the Gengzi year (1900) echoed the Xinmin Congbao (New Citizen Journal) of Liang Rengong (Liang Qichao), serving as a pioneer of the cultural movement. In middle age, he devoted himself to literature and art and the newspaper industry, abandoning politics. He also indulged in Chan Buddhism, often worshiping Buddha and feeling compassion for the world. In his spare time, he cultivated his mind through calligraphy and painting, not for fame or profit, so his craftsmanship became more specialized and authentic. His unique style was quite different from the trends of the time, being both vigorous and refined, comparable to Dai Chunshi and Zhang Ziqing of the late Qing Dynasty. He did not easily paint for others, and few people knew about it. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), when the Shibao had been taken over by Mr. Huang Bohui, Chu Lao (Di Chuqing) specially sent me two folding fans with his own paintings and calligraphy. One painted "A few crows in the setting sun, a stream winding around a lonely village," with the meaning of the words, and the other painted "Clear stream and wild gulls, distant mountains with Chen willows," inscribed with "Fame and profit are far overseas, right and wrong do not reach the wild gulls." Both scenes were clear and elegant, the colors were refined, the water birds chased in groups, and the sky geese lined up in formation, only with the tip of the brush and a little ink, slightly dotted on the paper, they were lifelike. It was definitely not something that mediocre hands and shallow learning could achieve. Because he collected many famous works of the Song and Yuan dynasties, he usually observed, studied, and copied them, understanding them in his heart and having a secret of his own. He also had his own joy, never selling paintings, and never telling others about his ability to paint. The reason he made these for me was only because I had served the Shibao for many years, and he voluntarily gave them to me as a memento, and instructed me not to show them to others. Before this, I only knew that Chu Lao could write well, and did not know that his painting was so wonderful. Both pieces of calligraphy, one in regular script (copying the Thirteen Lines of Luoshen) and one in running script, were matched with Xiangfei bamboo fan ribs, all with elegant colors, and I still treasure them carefully today.</p>
<p>Chu Lao's calligraphy learned from Chu Suiliang, magnificent and elegant, with a lofty bearing and comfortable brushwork, a clear and pure air that strikes the eyebrows. Among the famous calligraphers of the Tang Dynasty, such as Yan Zhenqing, Liu Gongquan, and Huai Su, there were many learners, but the styles of Chu Suiliang and Yu Shinan were the most difficult to learn. Chu Suiliang's writing has many risky strokes. Zhao Shijun, whose style name was Shengbo, of Jiangxi, was a skilled follower of Chu Suiliang. He once wrote a biography for Madam Di Wang Guanding. Zhao was a close friend of Di. Di specialized in Yu Shinan, both of which were difficult for people, but they were equally skillful and worthy of being passed down to the world.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th Incident," the ferocious faces of the Japanese invaders were fully exposed, and the unprecedented national crisis was even greater than before. Gu Weijun took on a major responsibility, first accompanying the Lytton Commission out of the customs, facing the threats of the Japanese "puppet" regime, and going through all kinds of hardships. Then he went to Geneva to appeal to the League of Nations. The Japanese government, fearing Gu's prestige, knew that Fang Ze Qianji was no match for him, so it sent Matsuoka Yosuke as its representative. Matsuoka was also a student who had studied in the United States, graduating from Oregon State University. He later served as president and vice president of the South Manchuria Railway, and had always advocated aggression. He was also a beautiful talker and eloquent, with a sharp mind and cunning thoughts. At Geneva, he spoke without restraint, often comparing China to the Boxers, hoping to use alarming words to stir up the views of Westerners, and his tone was extremely尖酸毒辣. Our representative, Dr. Gu, responded with a calm attitude and clever rebuttals, treating him like a child, playing with him in the palm of his hand. When Matsuoka was triumphant and chattering endlessly, Dr. Gu only listened with a smile, not responding directly, but attacking the enemy's weaknesses, often using one or two old examples to counter his hundreds, making the representatives of various countries unable to help but smile. Matsuoka turned red in the face. Later, the majority of member states voted to declare Japan an aggressor nation and denied the existence of the puppet state of "Manchukuo." Matsuoka and his government were ashamed and angry, and withdrew from the League of Nations, thereby doubling their perverse actions, leading to the July 7th Incident, full-scale invasion, followed by the Pacific War, and finally collapsing and surrendering.</p>
