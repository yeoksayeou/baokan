<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕蔣主席於除夕發表三十七年元旦對全國軍民廣播詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>全國軍民同胞們，今天是中華民國三十七年開國紀念日，中華民國自開國以來，遭受了連續不斷的內憂外患，經過長期間的險阻艱難，我全國同胞在國父領導和遺訓昭垂之下，共同努力，再接再厲，摧毀了帝制餘孽，掃除了封建　據，擊敗了侵略　國，到了今年，中華民國　進入憲政時期，我們可以說今年是行憲之年，而今日乃是行憲年開始之旦，在這行憲年開始的今日，我首先希望我全國同胞體念先烈　造民國的艱難，嘗盡民主國家公民的天職，擁護憲法，實施憲政，以建立國家永遠不拔之基；同時，更應該　察國家現實的環境，民族遭遇的危機，明大義，別利害，羣策羣力，同心一　，繼續五十年國民革命與八年對日抗戰的精神，爲　　民族公敵而共同奮鬥，爲排除國家憂患而一致努力。</p>
<p>今天已是抗戰勝利後第三度的元旦，我國八年對日抗戰，全國軍民同胞不惜犧牲一切，忍受無比的痛苦，原是爲保障國家的獨立，自由而戰，也爲了粉碎日本帝國主義者割裂我國土，破壞我統一，阻礙我　　，以滅絕我民族生存的毒計而戰。我們同胞茹苦飲痛，犧牲奮鬥，原意勝利以後獲得休養生息，安居樂業的機會，而我們民族亦可由此復興，國家亦可由此強盛，不料共匪在我全國同胞長期流血的八年抗戰時期，自始至終就進行他顛覆國家，危害民族，全國叛亂的　　，他一方面在表面上與政府合作，表示一致對日抗戰，一方面則極力避戰，與敵寇秘密諒解，互不侵犯，專心致志保持他的地盤，擴張他的力量，待到抗戰勝利，他就　然發動變亂，破壞統一，　喪我民族復興的　　，　　我國家　　的良機，阻撓復興，殘害民生，使我劫後餘生的同胞重臨於無憲　　，無　可復的環境。我們在匪區受共匪　　的同胞，不但　　過　抗戰時期流離顛沛的生活，而且還要遭受比抗戰時間　倭寇　　姦淫殘殺奴辱更加不堪忍受的災　。今天全國間受匪亂影響，一般同胞固然是生計日　，　　　　受　壓，不得稍紓喘息，其從匪區衆歷死逃亡出來的同胞，更是扶老携幼，　饑　寒，窮　無顧，尤其是陷身匪區，無法脫離鷹爪的同胞，那種求生無路，求死不得，暗無天日的苦況，更非言語所能形容，國家遭此　　，人民受此創傷，實爲我國自存歷史以來空前未來的浩劫，中正當此元旦節人，槪念　　，循省責任，對於我們同胞的困苦　連，心中的　念和悲痛，實不是任何言語所能　　於　一。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國家平等自由　必以統一獨立爲前提　指出同胞救國自救應盡的責任 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>我們現在是進入民主憲政時期了，但是民主政治必以國家平等自由爲前提，而國家的平等自由，尤必以國家統一獨立爲前提，惟有全國人民遵循法規，擁護統一，爭取獨自由民主與光榮的國　。我們中國如果不能統一，則民族生存就失去保障，國家不能統一，則經濟建設就無法推進，國家不能統一，則民主憲政就不能　走，三民主義共和國的基礎，共匪今天　　　了無恥的自稱其　　叛亂，殺人放火爲愛國，更可笑的，是以其嚴密封鎖，製造恐怖　　　　爲民主，實際上雖都知道，共匪的心目中絕對沒有國家，沒有民族，更絕對沒有民主，沒有自由。共匪在一年以前，早已反對國民大會，否認憲法，　　民主，而在這一年以來，更以割裂領土，　　主權，　亡中國，毀滅民族，爲其武裝叛亂的目的，他為了進行這　不可告人的目的，爲了　　以　　　　　，就不　　　　　我們的國土　　，他在經濟上，社會上，　　　　　我們的社會基礎和經濟基礎，他對於整個國家是要滅絕我們中國優秀的文化和倫理，消滅我中國五千年悠久光榮的歷史，他違反人性，而製造　　，他破壞統一，而毀滅建設，他所要德是人民的　　貧窮和死亡，不是人民的安樂和生存，在匪軍所到的地方，普遍發動鬥爭，製造人與人間的仇恨，他們所標榜的「土地革命」實際是指使無業遊民　　地痞統制整個農村，壓迫　　農民，他更不惜毀滅人類理性，造成瘋狂心理，行使殘暴恐怖，以助長人與人間殘酷的鬥爭，共匪在匪區以內的種種暴行，證明了他們不但要使我們國家國不成國，而且要使我們人民人不成人，共匪在匪區以內　　的　勵骨肉相殘，養成父子仇殺　　　，迫令婦女成軍，美其名爲充當　　團員，實際是供匪黨幹部　慾的工具，更可痛心的，則是　　每一兒童都要編入少年團，訓練其窺探家庭仇視父兄違反人性的罪行，他的暴行，可以綜括爲三句話，第一，他爲了要消失人民的國家槪念，所以要破壞家庭，滅絕人倫，第二，他爲了要破壞社會秩序所以要激勵仇恨，崇尚詭詐，第三，他爲了要進行　　專政，所以要　　恐怖，毀滅民主，共匪以罪惡爲品德，以欺騙爲忠實，對事不擇手段，對人不知廉恥，他　用　種手段來消滅我民族的生命，破壞我社會的生計，危害我國家的生存，其用心之險　　之深是在超過於日寇的侵略。日寇侵略　　僅　　　的外　而今天共匪的叛國，　　　有外患性質的內亂，這種滔天罪惡，如果任其推演不加剿滅，我們國家就不免於死亡，我們人民就將爲人牛馬供人奴役，那裏還有自由可言，也更沒有民主憲政可望了。同胞們只要訪問從匪區流亡出來的難民同胞，試問在匪區之內還有那一個智識份子尚能生存，而不爲共匪所殺害。凡是共匪所過之地，還有那一個窟窿可以幸免苟全，還有那一個人可以自由生存，而不被共匪壓迫作犧牲品，因此，可以知道，我們當前剿匪的軍事，就是救國救民的戰爭，救國對害國的戰爭，建設對破壞的戰爭，自由對奴役的戰爭，光明對黑暗的戰爭，亦就是民主憲政對階級專政的戰爭，這實在是國家根本安危的關鍵，民族百年興亡的界线，所以我在今天要爲我全國同胞檢討去年以來剿匪軍事的形勢，檢討由共匪叛亂所造成的經濟危機，從而指出我愛國同胞今後救國自救應盡的責任。</p>

<h3 id="c4">檢討軍事形勢　國軍已完成戰略目的　對關內流匪進行追剿 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>我們檢討過去這一年間剿匪軍事，首先要指出在戰亂動員令頒發以前，政府是在極度忍讓之下，竭盡方法，以求避免戰事的。政府自抗戰勝利即已停止徵兵，原有官兵員　　經聯絡整編，大量裁減，而我們國軍在去年六月以前，爲了體念人民痛苦，保存國家元氣，對於共匪從未採取積極的軍事行動。反之，共匪　　　叛亂，在匪區以內屢次動員，　在政府愛　和平未作戰爭準備之時，到處　　鉆隙，擴張他叛亂的範圍，充實他叛亂的力量，我一般社會民衆對共匪姦計認識不清，即在七月間戰亂動員令頒布之後，依然爲共匪反動宣傳所迷惑，尤其在我後方各省市間諜縱橫，謠誣頻興，各種混亂複雜的現象，　難澄清，因此，對於動員遂未能澈底實施，剿匪軍事遂不能收　十分的成效，在這種情形之下，前線國軍一直在被動中作戰，也一直在孤立中應戰，以致一年之內屢受損失，將士　　爲　　，然而在此種作戰條件極端艱難的狀況之下，國軍在戰場上已　　　了最大的任務，打　了　　最大的難關，第一就是共匪　　　所在地延安的佔領，第二十沂蒙山區的老巢完全被我們國軍摧毀，被我們國軍收復，第三是關內匪黨的主力不斷的被我們國軍追摧毀，使之不能立足，而其　　華北，分裂國土的陰謀，亦就　　爲我們國軍所粉碎。大家都知道，延安是共匪　據十年以上，爲其割據華北的根據地，沂蒙山區市共匪軍械製造和軍需物資儲藏的總庫，而　東半島上的烟台，則是共匪海上對外唯一的交通補給綫，但是我門國軍憑着忠勇義　的精神，建成其在圖形上最險阻和在作戰上最艱難的目標，終於克復了延安，掃蕩了沂蒙山區，最後更收復了烟台，對共匪積年所經營的巢穴，所　　的物資，所憑藉以號召全部匪軍的首腦部，次第加以　　，從此共匪的所謂政治中心和神經總樞是喪失了，他所籍以生存的經濟　　是摧毀了，他對外交通的最終海口　斷絕了，國軍所付出的代價，誠然巨大，但是所預期戰　的目的，　已在去年一年中如期完成，關內匪軍受創，不能立足，亦無法負隅，祗得被迫分　，成爲流寇。劉伯承·陳毅等匪部，今日雖仍猖狂分竄，但他流竄到黃河以南，就成爲無窩之盜，無穴之鼠，前面沒有目的，後面沒有歸路，只有打　　　，盲目　　，國軍對此匪部，自更易追剿肅清，可以說剿匪全役最困難的工作，在去年一年間業已完成了，大家都知道，七月以前在關內的匪軍完全是主動的負隅反抗，決不肯放棄其根據地，而傾巢流竄的，但自我國軍七月開始進剿以後，他就無法固守，不能不流竄避戰。而國軍則由防守階段進到進剿階段，最近更進了　追剿階段，在這種形式之下，共匪爲逃避其最後滅亡的命運，最近已回復他在江西時代的猙獰面目，在所佔領的匪區之內，不論鄉村城市，都用沒收清算覆查等等手段，對一切男女老幼加以無　　的壓迫剝削，　以鬥爭殘殺的方法，驅迫全體民衆澈底供他作叛亂的犧牲品。共匪這些變本加厲，窮凶極惡的行為，亦就可以證明他　　　窮，已到了最後末路的階段了，我要爲大家說明，目前劉伯承股匪軍雖然還在大別山區流竄，妄想重建其華中根據地，豫西和豫東的陳毅股匪，雖仍在破壞交通，企圖阻撓我國軍的追捕搜剿，以期苟延其殘喘，但國軍在此半年之中，對於剿匪整個計劃的準備，業已完成，深信匪軍所有各種企圖必遭粉碎，而其所有幻想自成泡影。至於東北方面匪軍雖造次發動攻擊，在關外久經戰陣的國軍，爲了保衛東北的領土主權，全體官兵必不惜任何犧牲，倍矢忠勇，與匪作戰到底，必至完全收復領土主權而後已，這是當前剿匪軍事形勢的一斑，要爲我全國同胞明白指出的。（下接二張一欄）</p>

<h3 id="c7">元旦敬祝行憲 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>中華民國憲法，於去年元旦公布，十二月二十五日施行，今天爲三十七年元旦，距憲法公布之期適屆一年；距憲法施行之日已滿一週。今年應該是名正言順的「行憲年」了。行憲年的元旦，開筆大吉，首應至敬至誠的祝頌憲法施行之順利。</p>
<p>根據憲法第一條，「中華民國基於三民主義，爲民有民治民享之民主共和國」，故憲法實在是我國實施民主政治的象徵。憲法之所以可貴，不在此一百七十五條之條文，而在這些條文所包含的精神，這精神就是民主精神。我們要行憲順利，首先當盡力培養每一個國民的民主精神；必須上自元首大官，下至販夫走卒，都具備那至可寳貴的民主精神，然後憲法始能有牠無上的尊嚴與權威。</p>
<p>然則什麼是民主精神呢？簡單說來，民主與獨裁專制之不同，就在前者容許反對的意見而後者不許，前者以理論說服反對者而後者以暴力制止反對者。故憲法之能行與否，行之而順利與否，就得看今後我們的政府與社會，官吏與人民，對於任何主張或設施，究竟如何發表其意見，推行其政策。假使確能按照會議討論的方式，贊成與反對者雙方均許其有合理辯論的機會，一方面絕不存入主出奴的片見，更不隨便用張力禁止異己的議論，另一方面也絕不固執偏激，一味以反對或破壞爲能事，而能服從最後多數的取決，那就可望進於民主之域。反之，如果我們還是積習相沿，不願用理論來折服人家，如往日若干官吏，在議塲上從不願意聽到相反的議論，偶爾辯難，就動意氣；或者如現在的共產黨徒，反對政敵，不用口舌筆墨之爭，而必欲逞兵作亂，與國軍戰塲相見以爲快，這都是缺乏民主精神的素養，我們願祝大家一洗這些有己無人，惟我獨尊的舊染之污，而盡其可能以培養民主精神的根苗，則行憲纔能順利。</p>
<p>其次，民主國家所最重視的，爲人民的自由與權利。此在我國憲法上，則凡人民身體之自由，居住遷徒之自由，言論講學著作出版之自由，秘密通訊之自由，信仰宗敎之自由，集會結社之自由，以及人民之生存權，工作權，及財產權等等，均已詳定於第二章中，而且「除爲防止防碍他人自由，避免緊急危難，維持社會秩序或增進公共利益所必要者外，不得以法律限制之」（見第二三條），如公務員違法加以侵害，應受懲戒並負刑事及民事責任，被害人民並得向國家請求賠償，（見第二四條），可見行憲後的政府應該如何尊重人民應享的自由及權利。目前政府儘管在戡亂，憲法雖還沒有全部實行，但這第二章毫無疑義應該首先認眞實施。最近各地軍警機關，常有根據不負責任的密吿，隨便捕人，隨便搜查住所的事實，而誣吿者並未反坐，或甚至根本是匿名或揑名的誣吿，此輩官吏卻只知侵害人民自由，而並不懍然於自己作風的違憲。有時，政府很輕率的規定一種辦法，而從未考慮到施行這些辦法的結果，將使無辜的人民喪失其財產權，工作權或甚至喪失其生存權，例如强制沒收（以低價兌換等於沒收）人民家藏的銀器，沒收人民携帶的黃金，禁止棉花商人的收購棉花而美其名曰統購之類，嚴格說來，都是牴觸憲法的！憲法第一五二條明明規定：「人民具有工作能力者，國家應予以適當之工作機會。」我們眞不懂在戡亂時期，本來勉强可有工作的棉花商人，究竟犯了什麼罪，要迫令他們失去工作呢？國家已進入憲政，我們願祝官吏痛改他們過去陳腐的觀念，切莫以爲小百姓儘可隨便擺佈欺侮，讓他們爲所欲爲，應知此後的一言一動，處處須尊重人民依法所應享有的自由與權利。惟有這樣的官吏，纔有資格在行憲的政府裏辦理公務。</p>
<p>最後，民主政治是議論的政治，一切政策和法律須取決於議會的討論。故中國憲政的推行究能順利與否，首先得看未來的國民大會和立法院如何進行牠們的工作。須知議會政治最重政黨的運用和秩序的維持；有了政黨，發言纔可有頭緒，有了秩序，討論纔可有決定，然後大大小小的議案，自能在合法合理的辯論之下得到解決，政府施政乃有所秉承。否則，二三千人的國民大會，六七百人的立法院，如果大家誤解民主，只知各以發言露頭骨，七嘴八舌，鬧個不休，而一旦爭辯相持，彼此不服，馴至可如民元國會，擲匣動武，恬不爲怪，我們又將何所期望？故要求行憲的順利，必得禱祝國大代表和立法委員牢記二議：　有黨籍者必須各自遵守黨的紀律，各自服從黨的政策。一個議案，甲政黨有所決定以後，甲政黨的黨員就該一致，由指定的發言人發表主張，萬不可各自爲政，都上發言臺滔滔雄辯，躭誤了議事的時間。　各種會議，必須嚴守議事規則，而議事規則之執行與議塲秩序之維持，尤須明定條文，派任糾儀人員，協助主席認眞辦理。一切國民代表或立法委員，均就是成習慣，尊重糾儀人員的地位與職權，會議始可進行得頭頭是道。這在英美等車，國會議事，無不如此。這一點議會制度起碼的條件，必須首先做到，民主憲政纔可在搖籃中長成茁壯起來。</p>

<p>我們今年度的剿匪工作，爲根本肅淸匪患，還是要政治重於軍事。在軍事方面，首先要消滅匪軍的有形力量，纔能肅淸蔓延各地的散匪，我們此時對剿匪功效固不可期之太速，亦不欲作太容易的估計，但消滅匪軍的有形力量，終可在一年以內完成，至於全國各地的散匪，須待有形的匪部消滅以後，再加上一年或二年的時間，方能澈底肅淸，爲達成消滅匪軍有形力量的目的，必須使國軍能足衣，足食，足械，足兵，此實有賴於全國同胞與政府同心一德，各盡職責，繼續八年抗戰的精神，有錢出錢，有力出力，人人公戡亂爲已任，以建國爲目標，尤其針對共匪全面竄擾，造成窮苦貧困窒息民生的毒計，必須消滅其各處潛滋暗伏的匪探，澈底淸除其所謂「地下組織」，這是防匪止亂，澄本淸源的唯一要點，尤須我各地社會人士劍及履及，一致奮起，共同負責組織民衆武力，健全地方團隊，人人自衛，處處設防，使意圖流竄的殘匪無隙可乘，不敢深入，使潛伏待發的散匪，不能立足，無法生存，如此舉國一致全體動員，軍事，政治，社會，經濟，敎育，文化相互配合，軍民協作閭里同心，保國保鄉，殊死奮鬥，則證以歷史先例，如何頑强的流寇悍匪，沒有不在民衆偉力之前整個覆滅的。祗要看河南宛西一隅的自衛力量已能使陳　匪部遭受空前懲創，幾於全軍覆沒，凡我愛國同胞，就可以感奮興起了。</p>
<p>上面已說明了剿匪軍事形勢和剿匪軍事的要求，其次我更欲爲我同胞說明目前社會經濟危機所由造成的主因，以及國家對安定經濟應取的方針與人民對安定經濟應有的認識和努力，大家應已明暸當前經濟上日趨深刻的危機，乃是共匪所蓄意造成的，如果我們一般同胞　安自私，不知警惕，反而推波助瀾，加深危機，這正是萬惡共匪所歡迎稱快的，國家經八年長期抗戰，無所本已凋喪，生產受盡摧殘，乃緊接抗戰勝利，共匪即揭露叛亂的野心，在這兩年多以來，到處阻礙復員，阻撓接收，到處破壞交通，破壞工礦，破壞社會秩序，破壞奄奄一息的農村，乃至混入商業市塲，利用商界敗類，散播流言，助長投機，助長囤積，更復走私逃稅，搗亂金融，以加深經濟的失調，而破壞整個經濟的基礎，這種奸計陰謀，我們一般同胞竟漫然不察，所想的，所說的，所做的，有意無意之間，都做了共匪的幫兇，不惜陷國家於經濟危機日深的境地，這種現象，實爲都市中一般利己損人不正常的心理所造成，正與其匪蓄意破壞經濟，危害國家，窒息民生的罪惡殊途而同歸。我在此祇舉一例即可明瞭，目前我國通貨發行額，和戰前相比的倍數，遠不及一般物價和戰前相比的倍數，至少可以說前者的倍數祇及後者四分之一，然則這三倍以上的漲價，如果不是商業市塲因投機競買囤積居奇而故意高抬，何至物價混亂有此不合理的現象。同胞們，我敢斷方，我們的經濟危機，並非人力所不能挽救，無　說是工商界對於共匪禍害與國家危機以及個人利害生機關係認識不淸，以至對經濟國策不能誠心擁護，甚至陽奉陰違，惟利是圖，而不知「皮之不存毛將焉附」。這種行爲不僅害國家，亦無異於自殺。我要痛切喚起全國各大都市的工商界，應有最低限度的警覺，要知道此時爲救國自救，惟有誠意協助政府，爲安定經濟而努力，切莫短視自私貪圖暴利走上與國家安定人民利益相反的道路，我都市同胞必須立即改正不合理的生活現象，屏絕不正常的心理狀態，勤勞節約，公爾忘私，爲剿匪戡亂，統一建國增加生產與穩定經濟，而激發各自的良知，動員各自的能力與財力，國家今後的經濟政策和經濟措施，須適應戡亂建國的要求，須適應大多數人利益的要求須適應國家長期自力更生的要求，而決不能牽就少數人茍安享受，投機暴利的要求，凡是出於投機暴利的私心，假借口實，以破壞國家的動員法令與經濟政策者，法律固必予以應得的懲處，而社會也必將予以有力的制裁。我以爲，目前經濟現象，祗要大家整肅生活，澄淸觀念，戒除浪費，厲行節約，顧全大局，計慮將來，共同一致，從安定金融增進生產上努力，則以我國土地之廣物產之豐，人口之衆，經濟基礎之厚，不患目前危機不能消除，民生建設必可推進，而共匪破壞我國經濟，杜絕同胞生機，以造成其亡國滅種之陰謀，亦自可隨之粉碎，而計無所施了。</p>
<p>全國同胞們，當此歲首令節，我們應該猛省國家憂患恥辱的深重，應該認識共匪禍國殃民的狠毒，應該覺悟民族危機亟待挽救的迫切，應該痛念匪區同胞水深火熱的痛苦，應該關切流亡同胞窮困無歸的慘狀，應該感念剿匪將士爲國爲民犧牲奮鬥的艱苦，應該感謝我絕大多數農工生產同胞的辛勤，尤其應該體會自力更生與自求多福的敎訓，爲了我們自身的生存，爲了我們後世子孫的幸福，爲了保持抗戰勝利的成果，爲了鞏固民族復興與國家統一的基礎，爲了促進民主憲政的實施，爲了求得我們全體同胞安居樂業的生活，我們必須提起深切的責任感，發揮濃厚的同胞愛，同心同德，相助相扶，以昨死今生的決心，實行剿匪建國總動員，擁護戡亂國策，加强自衛武力，鞏固社會秩序，維護經濟安全，撲滅危害國家的共匪，掃除我們統一復興的障碍，祗要我們信心不搖，堅忍不拔，節約勤勞，踐履　實，奮勇向前，相信最近期間必能達成我們戡亂救國，剿匪救民神聖的時代使命，開闢國家光明的前途，建立我們統一獨立平等自由三民主義的新中國，中正謹以至誠，祝我們全體同胞日新又新，努力邁進。（完）</p>

<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕吳秘書長鐵城，除夕以「我們齊向民主邁進」爲題，發表廣播演說，其原詞如次：</p>
<p>各位同胞，各位同志：</p>
<p>今天晚上，大家都在圍爐守歲的時候，我要向各位說幾句話。</p>
<p>明天，是中華民國卅七年的元旦，是民選政府成立的一年，實在有着劃時代的意義，我們得到有今天，是經過了國民黨和全國人民五十多年的共同奮鬥，尤其是八年多抗戰重大犧牲的成果，應該多麼地珍惜這劃時代的收穫呀！</p>
<p>所謂劃時代的意義，是在實施憲政。憲政是什麼。就是實行憲法的民主政治，憲法是什麼。是人民規範政府和本身權利義務的大法。政府和人民應該做的事，或者不應該做的事，都明白規定在憲法之中；國家有了憲法，政府和人民就要共同守法，不守法就是違憲。</p>
<p>民主政治是什麼？是以民爲主的政治。在這種政治進行的時候，各種政見不同的人民，結成團體，成爲政黨。在議會中佔多數，在政府中居執行地位的政黨，就是執政黨；政見不同的少數黨，就是反對黨。無論是執政黨，反對黨，都要在共同目標下，互相容忍，互相策進，憲法才能實行；憲政才有進步。中國共產黨，已經成爲一個武裝叛國的集團，他們是民主與自由的敵人，顯然不配稱爲憲政中的反對黨，在政黨政治中，顯然沒有他的地們。</p>
<p>國家的利益高於一切，黨的利益，重於黨員。國民黨同志的實行主義，爲的是國家利益；其他政黨的行動，當然也要以國家利益爲前提。國民黨的同志，要習慣與友黨合作，要在容忍反對黨的雅量，樹立民主政治的風範；其他政黨，也要有相忍爲國的風度。祗有這樣，才能完成三民主義新中國的建設。開國的國民黨，有極光榮的歷史，尤其要運用黨的紀律，發揮黨的力量，纔能保障新中國建設的完成。</p>
<p>正因爲憲政不能一蹴而成，前途因難還多，所以國民黨的還政於民，並不是卸責任。蔣主席在聖誕節廣播，曾經說到「新憲法的實施，祗是完成我們建設新中國的最後目標的初步。」就可知今後國民黨和全國同胞的責任，同樣重大，尤其是這一代的靑年，負有承先啓後的使命，責任更加重大。我們要能够担當這種重大責任，首先要做到生活和政治打成一片，就是每個人的生活習慣，要和民主政治的精神和方式，合而爲一。也就是人人得過問政治，同時人人要遵守法律，服從多數人的決議，和尊重別人的自由。</p>
<p>同胞們，同志們！要知道國家當前的災難，是共產黨的叛亂，人民要與政府合作，戡平共產黨的叛亂，才可以永久鞏固國家和平統一，永久保證民主自由。戡亂與行憲，是我們當前的兩大課題，希望參加各地競選同胞同志，更能宣傳主義，倡導民衆，迅速完成建設國家的責任。</p>
<p>在努力當前急要工作之下，不要忘了革命先烈和抗戰將士遺族的孤苦，匪區同胞的游離失所，我們應當去安慰他們，救濟他們。</p>
<p>「有守有爲」是一句老話，「守」是不要忘記艱難締造的成果，「爲」是通往邁進於偉大的前程。在這除舊佈新，具有劃時代意義的今天，謹以此勗勉同胞同志們的努力，並說新年快樂前程遠大光明！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：莫斯科訊，蘇外長莫洛托夫今日向蘇聯報界發表長達四千字之聲明，說明外長會議破裂之經過情形。渠稱，四强所以未能就對德和約獲致協議，乃因美國企圖使德國成爲美帝國主義之橋頭堡之故。美國態度頑固，强欲將其自己之意見，迫使他國接受，具文與皮杜爾一味追隨馬歇爾。彼等均將外長會議失敗之責任歸諸蘇聯，實則此次會議之所以失敗，乃由美國統治階級之獨斷政策。吾人僅有無條件接受美國之辦法，不然即無法獲致協議。美國此種政策在蘇聯之前遭遇挫折，獨裁政策乃外長會議失敗之主因。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦卅一日電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫今日在莫斯科電臺發表長達三千五百字之演說，其中間接表示歡迎重開四國外長會議，並謂獲致對德協定乃可能者。莫洛托夫稱：「各國間雖有意見上之分歧，然如能遵守耶爾達與波茨坦公約，則對德國問題頗有獲致一般性之協定。」渠表示蘇聯對重開四國外長會議甚感興趣。莫洛托夫是項演說，乃在答覆蘇聯各報記者關於十二月十五日破裂之倫敦會議之詢問。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿一日電〕莫洛托夫外長今日吿蘇記者稱，外傳外長會議失敗之說並不確實，四强政府就程序問題之研討已獲進步，祗因美代表團破壞整個會議之工作，遂致前功盡棄。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約卅一日廣播：華盛頓訊，杜魯門總統今日舉行記者招待會，向記者表示對新歲之賀意。渠認爲在聯合國機構範圍之內以謀全世界之普遍和平，在一九四八年仍爲極可能之事，良以聯合國機構實爲　致和平之最佳途徑故也。總統復謂和平不惟對美國有利，而係對任何其他國家均屬有利者。目前通往和平之大道上，雖屬荊棘　生，但美國決不因此而氣餒云。</p>

<p>〔路透社弗朗克福卅日電〕德境美軍區司令克萊已向德境法軍區司令寇尼許建議廢止美法兩區間之過境壁壘，法方反響尙難逆料，但渠希望探知法方對於兩區自由往來協定若英美區間者之反響，迄至目前爲止，美方並未企圖與其成立協定或決議。寇尼許今日曾至弗朗克福美軍總部訪克萊，克萊稱之爲純粹的交際行動，並未談及三區合併之可能。惟兩人晤談歷時達數小時之久。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約卅一日廣播：華盛頓訊，　希臘之局勢更趨惡化，美國務院與陸軍部方面極可能要求國會派遣美國作戰部隊前往希臘。代理國務卿洛維特吿新聞記者謂，今後行動，胥視環境之惡化而定。陸軍方面高級官員預料國會在六月底前可能作「極重大決定」，因至六月底，美國之經濟援希將吿一段落。依目前情形觀之，希政府無法在該時前將國內游擊隊消滅，美國最後一法，即爲派遣作戰部隊前往希臘。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕美國今日向蘇聯所控制巴爾幹國家提出照會，吿以承認共產黨「自由希臘」政府，乃違反聯合國憲章。同時美代理國務卿羅維特在記者招待會中，重申美國之立塲，並斥責希臘共黨游擊隊所稱，彼等在希臘北部設立一眞正政府。羅氏稱，就此事本身而言，並不足以使目前之局勢有實質上之改變，但若他國承認此一政府，則將引起嚴重反響。</p>
<p>他國此等行動顯然違反聯合國憲章之原則，若承認該政府者爲希臘北鄰之一，則其行動乃公然不顧聯合國大會十月間所通過決議案之行爲。羅氏之言乃要求巴爾幹國家與改組之雅典政府恢復正常外交關係。詢以希臘北鄰若承認該政府將引起何種行動，答曰渠不知希臘將取何種行動，但料其將向聯合國申訴。羅氏拒絕叙述美國是否正在考慮派遣軍隊赴希臘協助鎭壓共黨，據稱，美國政府須視局勢如何而定，渠不能在目前之甚易聳動時期，妄事揣測美國有何行動。</p>

<p>〔路透社雅典卅一日電〕雅典通訊社稱：聯合國巴爾幹委員會之調查小組，已抵距柯尼柴十五哩處之卡爾巴基，同時據希總理蘇福理斯稱，希北戰局殊佳，日內即可明朗。陸軍部公報謂，柯尼柴政府防軍屹然未動，政府軍且已收復柯尼柴週團之大部份山地，包括遊擊隊之基地維克拉山，遊擊隊未敢戀戰，已向北潰退。又據美援希使命團長格里斯伍特稱，美國援希之武器及配備，足供希臘敉平叛亂。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：羅馬尼亞京　　，羅前王米契爾之皇室家屬，今日向政府申請護照六十張，俾離開新成立之「人民民主共和國」。米契爾曾與內閣總理格　榮會商一小時，格氏對米契爾之希望出國，並不頣有所阻撓。米契爾曾談及渠與瑞士安娜公主之羅曼史。羅國衆議院今日開會，爲新任職之主席團舉行宣誓典禮，內閣閣員均在塲監誓。陸軍及公務員均表示對民主政府效忠。</p>
<p>格魯柴稱，羅王之遜位，早已考慮及之，實無新奇之可言，並謂羅國將加强國內各民族之團結，以及與愛好和平各國之友好關係，以防帝國主義利益之侵入。諜謂「吾人不欲戰爭而欲和平，藉循眞正之民主路線，發展我國自己之政策。」格氏宣佈王室財產已轉變爲國有，惟悉米契爾仍可獲得若干津貼，並可立即取得三百萬美元。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅京卅一日電〕羅國會今日召集開會，籌備民主共和憲法起草事宜，第一步當通過法案選舉制憲議會，草擬新憲法。</p>
<p>羅國改變政制英美不重視</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三十日電〕美國官員認爲羅王米契爾之遜位，在政治上比較的並無重要影響，彼等以爲此事之主要效果，僅爲除去東歐勢力圈內一觸目之人物而已。蓋米契爾乃羅馬尼亞完全被吸入蘇聯附庸國制度內之最後障碍，然事實上羅國政府之任何重大決議，早已不需米契爾簽字以生效，故米契爾之遜位，亦祗名裝上之廢止而已。倫敦外交部人士認爲米契爾之遜位，乃東歐共產化計劃中不能遜免的最後一種行動。羅馬尼亞之將如保加利亞及南斯拉夫之廢除民主，代以最高主席團，早在意料之中，此乃現在巴爾幹施行之「統一政策」之又一例子而已。巴黎外交人士認爲米契爾遜位乃籌組「巴爾幹聯邦」之先聲。左翼戰鬥報並曰，捷克於明年一月十五日舉行　普選時，共產將發動全力攻勢，此乃「歐洲戰役」眞正的開端。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京卅一日電〕麥帥今日發表新歲獻詞，維護其對日經濟政策，並喚起日本人之責任感。據稱，發行日本之藍本已近完成，今後發展，大部份繋於汝等自身，汝等人民應出以最大毅力，和約仍須及早締結，以解救日本貧乏之經濟。汝等之需要倘繼續超過生產能力，則汝等國內經濟有繼續控制之必要，以防汝等中之軟弱份子瀕於死亡。但此種管制要爲臨時性質，最後必須解除，實施自由企業。盟國之經濟政策，需要擊破日本過去之少數財閥壟斷制度，此種制度剝奪多數而使少數獲利，不容其存在。</p>

<p>出版界「中國文化史」讀後  康明　　柳詒徵著　正中書局出版　　昔黄黎洲先生之序歷代史表謂：自科舉之學盛，讀史顯無其人，由是而嘆人才之日下也。余嘗思之，今之所以不讀史，非以史為不可讀，實以史籍之浩瀚，無從讀耳！廿四史，兩通鑑，九通，五紀事本末，乃至其他別史，雜史，都計不下数萬卷，幼童習焉，皓首而不能盡，豈百學待治之青年，日力所能許？藉日能之，則所得又幾何？是故今日而勸人讀史，必先有可讀之史也。試觀晚清以來，積腐襮者，綜他人所詬病，與吾國人自省城關失，幾若然文化可言！坊間譯籍，率不　衆望，荏苒迄夸，言吾國文化，尙求有比較繁約適當之大學用書。　　歷史之學，最菓因果，因治歷史者，職在綜合人類過去時代複雜之事實，推求其因果，而為之解析，以詔示來茲，舍此無所謂史也。人頰之動作，有共同之軌跡，亦有特殊之蛻變，欲知其共同之軌跡，當合世界各國家，各種族之歷史，以觀其通，欲知其蛻變，當專求一國家，一民族，或數民族組成一國之歷史，以覘其異。自來史有編年斷代之别，彙者梁新會有斷代之作，才成一二目，未觉其緒；王雲五先生復勼各作家分輯專史，所輯亦未賅備，且分帙猥多，祗可作學者參考，不便於學年學程之講習也，凡陳一事，率與他事有運，專治一目者，必旁及相關之政俗苟盡芟緟複，又無以明其聯繫之因果，此斷代史之病也！本書作者以數千年豐備至史實為幹，益以近代各國新興之學拓其封，積半年之心力，寫成是書。遷之言曰：究天人之際，通古今之變，成一家之言，是書之作，其庶幾乎！讀其文，亦　亦賅，無漏無舛，探窮本末，源流俱見，可謂得浹際會通之旨矣！　　世界各民族均各有其不同之文化，如拉丁民族之文化，不同於斯拉夫民族之文化，斯拉夫民族之文化，又不同於中華民族之文化；此種不同之處，即民族文化之特徵，蓋不同之文化，由不同生活方式而來也。王德華先生謂我國文化之特徵約看五端：　就社會經濟言，中華文化係始終以農業經濟為本位之文化，　就社會結構言，中華文化係始終以家族為社會本位之文化　就政治形態言中華文化係始終未脫離封建政治之色彩　就學術思想言中華文化係始終以儒學為中心思想之文化，　就民族特性言，中華文化係一種重保守變和平，尙中庸之民族文化。本書作者更就文化發生之英國關係以研究中國文化及其與印歐文化之所異，卓見精闢，以吾國具有特殊之性質，求之世界，無其倫比耶，他國之特殊之處，有由强盛而崩裂者：有由弱小而積合者；有由複雜而渙散者；事例藄多，而求之吾民族，吾國家，乃適相反。此吾民所最宜懸以相較者也。吾國文化之特殊性質，約而言之三有如下述：　　第一，我國幅員之廣褒，世無其匹也。且我國廣褒之國境，固有漢，唐，元，明，清，累朝開拓，以致此盛，然自堯典禹貢以來，其所稱領有之境域，已不减於今之半數矣。第二種族之複雜至可驚也，今之中國，號稱五族共和，其實尙有苗、猺、獞、蔓諸種，不止五族，其族之最大者，世稱漢族，稽之史冊，其血統之混雜，決非一單範種族，數千年來，其所吸收同化之異族，無慮數百。試問吾國所以容納此諸族，溝通此諸族者，果何道乎？第三則年禩之久遠，相承勿譽。中國歷年之久，姑不間　　之荒誕傳說，即以今日所傳書籍之確有可稽者言之：據書經堯典則應託始於西元前二千四百年。據龜甲古文，則作　西元前一千二百年，據詩經則作於西元前一千一百年。至共和紀元以後，則逐年事實，皆有可考，是再西元前八百四十一年。且吾國史　之富，亦世所未有，今日所傳之正史，共計三千五百卷。　　吾國文化之特徵，已如上述。試進而申論吾國文化之本質：聖誓遺訓，以田地之道　人極。又曰：惟天下之至誠，則可以贊天地之化育。可以與天地慶。故吾之大學，明示正　，曰明明德，曰新民，曰止於至善。而其大欲在明明德於天下，非曰張霸權於世界，　政柄於城中，彝訓炳然，百世奉悉，官禮之興以此；文敎之昌以此；約之而為史。明乎此，以研讀中國文化史，當知津潔矣。　　柳詒徵先生自叙云：學者必先大其心量，以治吾史，進而求聖哲立人極，參天地者何在，是為認識中國文化之正軌。又曰：後此之視吾往史，殆不過世界史中之一部域，一階程，吾人正不容以往史自囿，吾人繼往開來，所宜擇情語詳，詔示來學，以貢世界，此治中國文化之責任。全書之博厚高明，不難想見矣。　　本書凡分三編：（計上中下三亘册），第一編自邃古以迄兩漢，是為吾國民族本其創造之力，由部落而建設國家，構成獨立之文化之時期。第二編自東漢以迄明季，是為印度文化輸入吾國，與吾國固有文化由抵牾而融合之時期。第三編自明季迄民初是為中印兩種文化均已就　，而遼西之學術思想，宗教，政法以次輸入，相激相盪而卒相合之時期。此三期者，初無截然畫分之界限，特就其蟬聯蛻化之際，略分畛畔，以便尋繼，實則吾民族創造之文化富於彈性，自古迄今，　　相屬，雖間有盛　之判，固未嘗有中絕之時，茍從多方診察，自知其於此見為墮落者，於彼仍見其進行，第二，　三期吸收印歐之文化，初非盡棄所有，且有相得益彰者焉。通俗天文學  中浣　　（Simon　Newcomb敎授著作，金克木譯商務印書館）。　　國內天文學方面的書，一向是很少的，近年來雖然比從前較多，却大都是談談星座以及新發現的書，否則又往往過於專門，還缺少一本較有系統而又不是課本的通俗天文學，這一本「通俗天文學」却正好適合這個條件，所以筆者極願意介紹本書。　　作者紐康敎授，是美國海軍的數學敎授，也是近代最偉大的天文學家，他再二十四歲時已因一件工作而得到國際的名譽，這便是小行星軌道的計算。紐康敎授在學術方面最偉大的貢獻是他關於月的運動的理論方面的探究，他曾經收集各天文台各圖書館中關於月的觀測記錄，所集中代有上下二千六百年之多。因為他對於月的研究會盡了如此的努力，所以本書中講「月」的一章也就特別的有趣。　　本書共分六編，第一編天體的運行講太陽系，星辰的視轉，時間與經度的關係，地球的周年運動與其結果，四季的成因，對講得都是視運動，所以作者處處呌我們脫離地球的範圍區觀，這樣才能得到準確的觀念。　　第二編講遠鏡，於淺鏡的裝置，遠鏡的製造和遠鏡　影術，都有詳蓋的指示。讀者如果對天文　正有興趣，想造一個小小的遠鏡，者上面的指示時很有益的。　　第三遍講的是太陽，地球，月亮和日月蝕。第四編講行星及其衛星，共分十二章，是最長的一章，火星一章是全編精華所在，說得極其詳細，這是因為近年來大家在火星上集中了很大的興趣之故。　　第五編講流星和彗星，第六編講恒星，是全書最够味的兩變，作者引了許多美麗動人的，關於星座的故事，文麗的星空　超了無窮之趣，同時他還告訴我們如何觀測星座，這對於初學天文的人，方便不少，　　一個作者，如果想不用專門語言來陳述天文學中的事實，他便要發覺自身處於雙重難境，不是只得將本題說出一個不完全的概念，九時說了許多，還不能够把真正的意義表達出來，致使他的讀者覺得煩厭。本書的作者採取一種折衷的辦法來對付這種困難，他一方面盡力地使所有的讀者都能了解而感到興趣，另一方面也加入一些專門的解釋，但是只限於為徹底了解某一些事實（如時間的量度，季節的變換，星座的變動方位以及行星的狀態等）而不得不如此時，加入把這幾點略去，讀者一定能在佔全書全體的天界現象的描繪於叙述中得到不少趣味。　　本書的作者盡力地指出和糾正我們一些關於天文常識的錯誤。他說：「我們也許會認為這些事情都太平常而不值得叙述，可是在「古船夫曲」（The　Ancient　Mariner英國詩人Colerioge名作）中竟描寫了一顆星在峨眉月的兩尖之間好像那兒沒有黑暗物體一樣。大概有過不止一個詩人描寫新月出現於東天，而傍晚的一輪滿月却照耀於西天」。　　自從本書初次出版以後，天文學方面又有不少重要的發現，所以這一次新版便完全校補一遍以求包羅新知識而趕上時代。校補者是紐康敎授的學生金克木先生，以前也曾譯述本書的時候添加了不少有關我國的材料，如中國標準時區圖等，這使本書生色不少。　　寒假即將到臨，這本書該是一本好的寒假讀物吧！新社會的新敎育  聶爾　　丁十著　鎮江　華美印書社　出版　一萬五千元　上海中國文化服務社經售　　當文化股枯萎的時候，出版凋零的時候，丁十先生貢獻出他的作品「新社會的新敎育」一書，實在是一件可喜的事。　　開始的第一頁，就有兩句話，「孥着敎育底眞理之光，照着人向那正確的生命的道路上走去。」凸顯在紙面上，當義更立體化了。　　它，是有一貫的中心的理論的建設的，深入的實踐的指引的，它的理論根據，是從新的哲學來的，有的人說哲學是研究世界一切事物一般法則的學問，是人類思維最高的總結。如果說經濟是社會一切事物的主觀精神基礎，哲學原是從一切具體事物裏概括出來的一般的法則。反過來說，哲學的法則也便滲透在一切具體事物裏。　　這本「新社會的新敎育」的哲學根據，是貫徹「理性」與「民主」的精神建立起來的簡約的敎育看法，初步的敎育做法。　　在「新敎育底滋長」裏，推介了三個實驗學校，——杜威先生的實驗學校，陶行知先生的實驗學校，陳鶴琴先生的實驗學校，第一章，一切一切都在變，包括變的宇宙，變的人類，變的社會，變的敎育，第二章，敎育思想的類型，包括民主主義的敎育思想，納粹主義的敎育思想，，共產主義的敎育思想，第三章，文明時代的生活傾向，包括勞動文化的要求，工業經濟的要求，民主政治的要求。第四章，一個新的開始，包括新社會就是理性社會，新敎育就是民主敎育，新社會的新敎育的功能，新敎育的學習態度。　　他更强調的說：　　『新中國新世界的道路，必然走向自由民主和平建設的道路，雖然充滿着長崎的封建性老裵性落後性與失衡性，正經歷着凸凸凹凹艱艱難難的波折，然而，這條道路一定要走上去的。』　　『新社會的新敎育的理論，是要不斷地把握住提煉出來服務人類貢獻人類，認定社會就是敎育。有各式各樣好好壞壞的社會，便有各式各樣好好壞壞的敎育，社會於敎育沒有矛盾，而是社會與社會有矛盾，而是這一種敎育與那一種敎育有矛盾，我們發覺了幾千萬年應該發覺而未發覺的客觀存在的事實之後，便自動地自主地控制着這一事實，把新的社會提煉出來，也就是把新的敎育提煉出來，以服務人類，貢獻於人類，而使人類得到更高級更完整更健康的文明的發展，根據這一個觀點，我們具體的說——即社會即敎育，在社會裏進行敎育，爲了社會向上而進行敎育。』　　我們讀過這本著作之後，覺得它有助於理性社會的建設，有助於民主敎育的創造。世界分國新圖  震達　　中國史地圖表編纂社編纂　亞光與地學社出版　三十六年七月初版　　第二次世界大戰是結束了，各國的疆域也重新劃定了，如台灣回到了祖國的懷抱，蒙古朝鮮菲律賓成爲了獨立國，立陶宛，愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞三國加入了蘇維埃聯邦，同時此次戰爭中罪魁禍首的德國日本，疆域也大為改變。我們研究地理，地圖是最必需的參考，同時又是地理敎學上最重要的工具。　　在勝利後的二年中，各家書局，與地學社出版的世界地圖很多，其中有深入獨到之地圖出版者，僅亞光與地學社出版中國史地圖表編纂社所編的世界分國新地圖。　　該圖內容百為地質，天文，地形，氣候人口產業交通政區諸圖，其次為各洲各國分圖，而以南北兩極殿其後。各分國圖之旁邊空隙處又將重要地方擇要繪為附圖，以資參考。共計正圖四十二幅附圖八十七幅。　　此圖地形用等高綫及分層設色法表示，吾人展圖一望即可知各地形如何。進而對於人口之疏密，農產之多寡，工商之盛衰，交通之便否，亦可推究知之。惜是圖中各著名山峯之標高，未曾加註數字。　　對於的里雅斯德的設寫自由市，此次戰爭著名的地名鄧扣克等，法蘇的戰時首都，德國的英美法蘇四國共管區等，想必閱圖者所亟知道的，而本圖都已把他繪製了。　　至於此圖的地名較之普通的一般世界地圖則又過之而無不及，且於各地名的下面或左右二旁又註有原文，至於地名之譯音大部根據商務印書館所出版的標準漢譯人名地名表，使閱圖者不至有生疏的感想。　　氣候區域，植物區域在地理中頗占重要的俄地位，所以此圖中宜加入植物區域圖及W.Koppen氏之氣候區域圖。　　太平洋於亞洲，美洲，大洋洲三洲的形勢，大西洋於歐洲，非洲，美洲三洲的形勢，關係極鉅，且沿洋諸國於貿易，國防，交通上莫不有密切的關係，所以此圖中宜加入太平洋，大西洋二圖。　　此圖後面又附以說明，對於各國地理概况均表白無遺。　　此圖茍能於說明之後，再加入地名索引，俾使閱圖者，對地名之找尋，節省時間，則更為可貴。　　總之辭圖編製得法，篇幅適宜，印刷精美，裝訂美觀，誠宜各界人士，人手一冊。故筆者不揣譾陋，於此實貴篇幅中，謹為之介紹。死屋手記  石碚　　（陀司妥也夫斯基著，耿濟之譯，聞明書店印行）　　陀司妥也夫斯基在一八四九年至一八五二年，這四年間，他住在斯伯利亞的托波利斯克的監獄裏，過着囚徒的生活。這本「死屋手記」，便是描寫他長期在獄中所經歷的事實，這是與普通的小說不同的地步。　　陀司妥也斯基在寫這本手記的時候，因為要避免當時審查官的誤解和壓迫，假借了阿力山大·彼得洛維奇為書中的主人翁，藉這個主人翁為名，寫出自己在獄中所見所聞。書名「死屋」，就是代表托波利斯克的監獄。在遙遠的西伯利亞的邊陲，這監獄立在一所堡壘的旁邊，從圍牆縫隙裏向外面　，祗能看見飄渺的天空的一角，和高　地長滿雜草的堡壘土壁，哨卒日夜在那裏巡邏着。在寂寞寒冷所包圍之中的，就是這座如「死屋」般的監獄。　　「死屋手記」全書分上下二卷，共二十一章。前面的「引言」，好像當做小說的序幕一樣，介紹了書中的主人翁阿力山大·彼得洛維奇，並且說明這本書的來源。這自然完全是作者編造出來的。除「引言」外，全書的內容都是叙述獄中的生活；從入獄後「最初的印象」以至「出獄」，中間經過四年的徒刑。作者在介紹這本書時說：「裏棉是阿力山大·彼得洛維奇所受十年的流戌生活的不聯貫的記述。有地地方叙寫中間挿入另一篇小說，一些奇怪的，可怕地回憶，都是不平勻地　　地寫下來的，彷彿受了什麽壓迫。我好幾次讀着這些斷片，幾乎相信是在瘋狂中寫得。但是流戌中的記事——『死屋中的景色』——他再稿件中自己這樣稱呼——我覺得不十分沒有趣味。至今無人知曉的，完全新類的世界，有些事實的奇怪性，對於幻滅的民族的幾種特別的批評，——這一切使我神往，我好奇地讀下去。」這些話，說明作者是怎樣的寫成了「死屋手記」。　　陀司妥也夫斯基以同情悲憫的筆，刻劃了各種各樣的罪囚，他們有地是車犯，偶然　殺人犯，職業的殺人犯，强盜，土匪首領，還有普通的騙子和浪人，甚至也有瘋子。他們從全俄羅斯的不同的角落裏，被遺送過來；從西伯利亞開辦罪囚的苦工制度實行後，他們被禁閉在獄中，一面熬受着鞭笞的毒刑，一面做着長年的苦工，度過陰　德日子。他們每一個人各自有一個辛酸的故事。但是，當他們踏進了監獄後的感覺，他們所要忍受着的磨折，不是親身經歷過來的人，是難於想像的。一些平民階級的流犯們，他們是被社會割舉了得碎塊，臉上被打上了烙印，成為被世界唾棄的一個永久不減的證明；他們被遺送到那裏去充當八年至十二年的苦工，以後再分遣到西伯利亞各鄉鎮去充當流戌民　　以上各種罪囚的面目，性格，和他們的願望，意趣，煩惱，以及幻想，都從作者的筆下，活生生地表現出來了。他們在陰暗的冬天和秋天裏，更加强烈地懷念着有鮮耀陽光的春天，懷念着自由的歲月。然而，被鎖牢了得被虐待了得靈魂，是最痛楚的。作者自身，便是體會到這樣的經騐：『我從院子裏回到營舍裏的時候永遠感到難過。那是一間長長得低矮的悶熱的屋子，蠟燭　淡地照耀着，發出沉重的，窒息的氣味。我現在不明白，我怎麼會在這裏面住上十年。我的三塊木板的牀舖：這就是我所有的地位。一間屋內有三十多人被安放在同樣的舖板上面。冬天關得早；必須等候四小時，大家才全睡着。在那時候之前，——是喧嘩，吵鬧，轟笑，辱駡，鐵煉的聲音，腐氣和煤烟，剃光的頭顱，烙印的臉，一切是可詛咒的，可　　的……是的，人是有活力的！人是能夠習慣一切的生物，我覺得，這是他的最好的定義』。　　最後讓我引用米川正夫對『死屋手記』的評語，作為我這篇介紹文德結束：『死屋手記，在那把滅亡的人們之各種各樣的典型生動地加以表現的素描之精確上面，在那透徹於事物之內在意義的理解之深度上面，在那滲透着全篇的敬愛他人的苦惱之眞摯上面，以及在那毫無浪費的均勻的全體構成上面，就在陀司妥也夫斯基的作品當中，也是屬於優秀的東西。這一手記的根本思想，就是作者發現出：連那些幾乎完全失掉了照上帝的樣子創造出來的容貌，而有類於野獸的極兇極惡的重犯，在某種機會裏，也可以偶然地表現出富於溫暖的眞實意味的心情，和深刻而正確的理解。可是，同時，那關於人類具有着怎樣，容易陷進殘酷，淫蕩，虛偽及其他一切罪惡當中的性質的問題，他也在死屋裏學到了不少的見識。這使得他深深地思索着人類的罪惡性及其道德的責任』。這就是陀司妥也夫斯基偉大之處，他銳利的深入的觀察，和對弱者悲憫的風格，成為他大部份作品中的基調。</p>

<p>自由談獻歲發春  白永　　「假使冬天來了，春天還會很遠嗎？」這句英國詩人的名句，如今幾乎成了濫調了。可是在歲尾年頭，無論如何，我們不能無此希望與預感。今年的冬寒，據說爲七十年來所僅有，中國的氣象學家，其實我也不大敢信，分明記得前些時還在報上大登其今年無冬天的溫暖消息，曾幾何時，西伯利亞的寒流就來了，一塲大雪，路有凍死骨，致勞各位大學的學生，滿街奔走，捐募寒衣。如今新年是到了，照中國的講法，過了除夕就是新春，「斗柄　寅」「一元復始」，好像從正月初一那天起，連柳樹條都變了顏色，自然心裏也會懶洋洋的。雪萊名句，說着卻是恰好。不過在陽歷年可不行，西歷是不尷不尬的，偏偏拿十二月一月二月作冬天，那麼，雖然獻歲，並未發春，而且「第二次西伯利亞反　旋正在進行中」，我們覺得「春」眞是還哉遙遙。　　等待是最不好受的，靑年男女大約都嘗過。若是沒希望便能，有希望而渺不可期卻討厭。其足以使人氣短與焦灼，殆與事到臨頭成爲幻泡差不多，古人曾說，「俟河之淸，人壽幾何」，因此而產生了消極的厭世。從前有閒階級曾製定一種「九九消寒圖」，譬如「亭前埀柳珍重待春風」共有九字，字有九畫，共八十一畫，描成雙勾，從「數九」起，每天塡一畫，到「七九河開，八九雁來」之後，這個把時間逐步切斷的法子很好，至少可以破除我們等待的寂寞，也就減少許多苦痛。雖然那也常常是有錢朋友吃羊肉火鍋打詩謎的記號。　　與其呆等，大不如找點工作這爲愈。古人說的「日月逝矣，歲不我與」，乃是非常傷心的話，不可等閒以文章俗套視之。試想我們有生以來，有若干大好時間在等候中逝去，假設把時間集攏來，必是一驚人數字。常見許多外國人，在旅行的舟軍中執卷吟哦不輟，我們則一肚皮不耐煩，東張西望，一事無成。今之女同學，多於聽課時打毛綫者，手腦並用，經濟之至，理宜提倡，不能以訓育主任認爲不合法而非之。假使我每天能利用「無聊」的時光，幹一點正經工作，大約亦早成爲專家，而不必在報屁股寫此無聊文字了。　　然中國消磨等待之方法是各式各樣的賭博與飲食，而新年其尤者也。曾有人以蘇州人吃瓜子爲題目，贊嘆中國人鍥而不舍的精神之偉人，可惜是僅僅用在囑瓜子，而不用在研究蘋果落地沸水衝　之類，遂使中國的麻將經比外國的撲克術神秘得多。連紐約的Club也以雀牌爲最有意思之消遣，而中國留學生有恃敎雀牌爲生者，則其功亦云偉矣。這且不說也罷，如果一旦等了來又將如何呢？眞的是大好春光能給人溫暖嗎？或是能夠「努力愛春華」的去作爲嗎？祁有點未可知。王漁洋的金陵雜詩有幾句至今記得：「十日雨絲風片裏，陽春烟景似殘秋」。這也未見得好過，傷春與悲愁似不止是中國的病態，全世界都不缺乏這種多悉多病的氣候與公子佳人。至於說工作，那更有趣，原來有一首呌做「春天不是讀書天」的諧詩，旣不讀書，又幹什麼？「有女情春，吉士誘之」。分明又鬧到風化問題上來了，總以不說爲妙。論戇  玄玄　　舞女作風大膽，能言一般女人所不敢公然言，謂之「十三點」；見人投河，捨身而起人於溺，或碰着强盜，竟敢反抗，因而遭强盜槍傷，謂之「戇」。前者不過做的過火，初無大罪。後者則簡直是今之君子，和威武不能屈的朋友，着實可以讚揚；但兩者卻被稱爲「十三點」，爲「戇」。　　「戇」者，弱者之駡人名辭也。自己見死不求，眼見別人救，總覺得不大順眼，也便是略有內疚，爲了替自己解釋，便駡救人者爲「戇」，則自己見死不救，便有了正當的理由，一面目救人者爲幼稚可笑，一而又覺得自己才世故已深，而決不作此無聊之事。　　「十三點」者，庸人之駡人名辭也。自己隨欲浮沉，渾渾噩噩，偶見別人認眞，便自嘆勿如，但此等庸人倒有「憂人發跡自怕窮」的積習，雖然自嘆勿如，總還要說自己的好，但實在無好可說，於是只能說人做得過份，只有自己才恰到好處，乃駡人爲「十三點」。於是不怕敲破飯碗，揭發上級貪污者，爲「十三點」。別人混水摸魚，獨彼淸廉自守，亦爲十三點矣。廣而言之，則天下忠臣義士，或聖或賢，無非是「十三點」了。　　當舞女這職業是否正當，是另一個問題，但旣當了舞女，儘量發揮職業舞女的精神，以廣招徠，又詎可厚非？正如客氣的剃頭店老闆向顧客端茶遞烟，面面俱到，一樣有職業道德也。　　自己不够，偏嫌人過火。別人盡職，自己連最低限度還做不好，乃益想益氣，便罵人爲「十三點」，爲「戇」矣。蕭伯納的矛盾  毛毅　　「戰爭是一種最惡毒的爲害於公衆的絆脚石……不論把戰爭當做任何這種無意識的屠殺與毀滅的藉口，我都不以爲然。」—時在一九一七年，第一次歐戰正酣，蕭伯納曾作此語。　　「我們何以要制止戰爭？它是一種罪惡嗎？戰爭是一種殺人的方法，而在這個世界上，有許許多多的人是應該被殺掉的。」—時在一九三四年，希特勒氣熖方熾，蕭翁曾作此語。　　「剩餘價值或稱資本，是萬惡之根源。」　　「金錢是世界上最重要的東西。它代表健康，力量，榮譽，慷慨和美麗。」　　「世界上沒有一種一個智慧的人能够信仰的宗敎。」—這是蕭翁在一九〇六年所說的的。　　「文化需要一種宗敎，和生死問題一樣。」—這是十五年後蕭翁所說的的。　　「一個受過敎育的人比一個未受過敎育的人更令人討厭。」　　「美國各階級所建立的公共學校是最有價值的組織之一。」新年樂趣  銅駝　　少年時歡喜新年，無非是可以不上學校讀書，在家盡情游玩之外，還有吃有喝，離開都市甚遙的鄉村，一年四季別無新鮮的娛樂，有之，唯是在新年裏可以看猴子戲，木人頭戲，草台戲，經濟實惠。衝之今日都市的兒童，每到一次公園看到在鐵絲籠裏跑踉的猴子，便歡喜躦歏；每在高貴的洋樓裏看到一次提綫的傀儡戲而拍手歡迎……等等情形而言，昔日鄉村的新年娛樂，乃是得風氣之先，可以敝　今日都市中的兒童生活的。　　不過年齡漸漸增長上去，新年的樂趣也漸漸減退了。第一，對於報紙上發表的新年獻辭就感到頭痛，千篇一律，講來講去，都翻不出「爆竹一聲除舊，桃符萬戶更新」一類如來佛的手掌。第二，今日許多人恐怕倒底還在憧憬着舊歷新年罷，因之就有人說陽歷新年是「官」的新年，凡事一染「官」氣，就很少溫暖，閑散，幽默，隨便的氣氛了。第三個理由就是因爲自己做了父親，對於孩子們的要求，尤其是新年裏，似乎應當慷慨一點。例如他們要賀年片，要看白雪公主電影，要買一盞走馬燈，你好意思吝嗇得不答應他們要求中間的一個嗎？而你的年終獎金還有問題，還在談幾成幾成，成數研究妥當以後，還要等陰歷年開發，試問你此時怎有餘錢可以答應孩子的要求？基於種種理由，新年的趣味，我　斷下來，是與年齡的增加成反比例的。　　所以有的人要在新年裏大賭大喝，在都市裏時髦一點的便是通宵跳舞，他們是爲了減少因新年來臨而感到似水流年的刺激——神經質一點便有「馬齒徒增」的感喟—於是設法求得官能的麻醉，像賭博，喝酒，跳舞—醇酒婦人與呼盧喝雉都是可以使你暫時麻醉一下。所謂「浮世的悲哀」也者，我們絕少在紙醉金迷的塲合裏遇到。然而當一個賭徒在破曉的曙色中踏上軌途，一個醉漢在嘔吐狼藉之後的夢回，一個舞袖闌珊，擦着惺忪倦眼的舞客跳進汽車裏的時候，當四面八方爆竹劈劈拍拍響了起來，他們頭腦裏偶然會清醒過來的，「哦，又是一年了！」　　然而我是一個樂觀論者，我總想在沒有希望的地方找尋希望，沒有光明的地方找尋光明，因此我也從沒有樂趣的新年中找尋樂趣。給我一找，居然找出了新年的樂趣。那便是新年放假三天，不上辦公廳，可以舒舒齊齊讓你連接遲起三天——在這種寒冷的日子，試問最大的樂趣除了擁被高臥，不受辦公時間的拘束，得以從從容容日上三竿時候起身之外，還有甚麼？而這最大的樂趣，便是新年所賦予。不過此事只能與每天上辦公廳的同道言之，若給老闆階級聽見，恐怕就要笑我們寒酸了。法律  王百里　　法律（本文是包括各種法令而言）是依照實際情形訂定的，人民依之以爲準繩，但今日的法律，爲杌隉的時代所支配，往往與事實脫節，但有時却又完全依照法律的明文實行，公說有理，婆說的也有理，弄得人民眞有元人詞曲所謂「對與不對間，妾身事事難」之慨了！譬如傷害罪吧：刑法上傷害罪，原有罰金一千元的，在打法律時候的一千元，可以買米一百石，現在依照法律罰起來，只可買大餅一只，假使依米價計算呢，那該罰一千元的，現在應改罰一億元了，但從未聞法院有過這樣的判決，法院雖也有增加到三五十萬元的，但與眼前事實距離，仍嫌過遠，無怪打人犯法者日多，因爲處罰金是滿不在乎的，如此「從輕發落」，其亦古人皮鞭示恥之意乎？但皮鞭示恥，祇是禮敎，而不是法治，論語注云：「凡人之知，能見已然，不能見將然，禮者禁於將然之前，而法者治於已然之後。」故禮與法雖是異途同歸，但不可一概而論，尤其是在今日的時勢之下。我想現在事事都講生活指數，那末法律上所有的金額，也都依照生活指數計算，纔見公允，但事實又不盡然，譬如政府搜出人民私藏的銀元，若爽爽快快給予沒收吧，這倒也心死，而政府却幣一抵一來收購，你能說政府不注重法律嗎？再說有功於國的人死了，政府給予恩榮，特賜撫恤金法幣三萬元，去領吧，不够作車錢，不去領吧，辜負了國家的恩典，眞弄得人啼笑皆非；但人民對政府的納稅呢，又不知要加幾千百倍來計算了。最近有一件妨害名譽的案子，原吿要求被吿賠償損失法幣一元，而被吿却當庭「慨然」願給法幣一千元，原吿說，打官司不是爲財，祗爲名誉，故不受一千元，仅一元足矣，这是有法律的根据，谁也不能说他固执，但被吿「慨然解囊」，情愿增加九百九十九倍来赔偿损失，这还能说他不豪爽吗？一个「謙讓」，一個「慷慨」，自有打官司以來，味曾見有如此「對頭」，可稱前無古人，後無來者。孟子說「盡信書則不如無書」，以書中事實亦不十分可靠故也，我則以爲與其有法律而不切實際則不如無法，註解是：不切實際的法律，結果祗有正當的人民吃虧。瑞典種種  許桐華　　瑞典國幅員狹長，長達九百七十八哩，沒有一年的闊度，超出三百十以哩上。其海岸綫的長度，約與美國相仿。瑞典的疆域中，百分之九爲湖泊，百分之十五則在北極圈內。　　逢到夏天的時候，瑞典人多赴南方避暑，溫度常在六十八度至七十度之間，他們受在日光中晒太陽浴。　　一個外國游客初次赴瑞典觀光時，有兩項印象最深刻，一是生活程度的高昂，一是到處皆是美貌的女人。　　瑞典是一個繁褥多禮的民族，人家介紹您會見他人時，您便須連連鞠躬兩次。如果足下參與一次宴會，餐畢須與東道主握手，正式道謝。又足下遇見不久以前款待你的一位朋友時，你招呼以他後，還得說一聲「Tack　for　sist」，這句瑞典話的意思就是：「以前承蒙邀爲上賓，十分愉快，謝謝你的美意。」　　瑞典人酒量宏大，常用大杯一飲而盡。舉行宴會時，女人例不喝酒，但經主人堅請她喝酒後，亦能破例。逍遙花  陳慎言　　第六章　如此良宵（三一）　　渚齋連連擺手道：「我不配。」綺紈道：「你一切都配，只有一件不配，你的婚姻太不合時代了，也許我這見解，是不對的。」諸齋喝了一口酒，把頭點一點道：「你的話一點不錯，這是我一生遺憾，最沒辦法的事！」綺紈道：「你認爲最沒辦法的事，我認爲是最容易解決的事，你還沒有兒女，祗你太太一位。」渚齋道：「是呀。」綺紈道：「那有什麼困難！」說着，飘了渚齋一眼，拿起酒杯，自喝了半杯酒，把杯放下，仍看在渚齋臉上。渚齋已经擎起酒杯，又復放下，把頭點一點道：「你說不困難，請敎有如何好辦法？」綺紈把頭一搖道：「這個我那能說！破壞人家家庭，是不對的。」渚齋道：「我明白了，你說我和她可以離婚，是不是？這事在我是很不容易的。」綺紈道：「我要發表一點意見了，我認爲人生最要緊的事，就是精神能得安慰。無論富貴貧賤，能得一個同心伴侶，和他合作，雖然過的如何艱苦的生活，精神是愉快的。人生短短期間，何必自苦！」渚齋道：「你這點很對，但是我上有父母，再說我這位太太，並沒失德，我有什麼理由，和她離婚？」綺紈笑一笑道：「聽你這話，是見你存心忠厚，報紙上每天都登有離婚啓事，這些人是不是都有失德，都沒有父母呢？」渚齋給她一問，也不由笑起來。綺紈道：「這就該罰你一杯。」渚齋立把面前一杯酒喝乾，將酒杯放下，仍豎着眉頭。綺紈道：「你別把這問題看得太嚴重了，這就怪我不對，不該提起這話，呌你難過。我明天要走了，不說這事，我們多喝兩杯！」渚齋道：「綺紈，你不該如此縱飲，你噪音要緊。」綺紈搖一搖頭道：「沒關係，保養我這條嗓子，有什麼價值呀！」渚齋道：「怎麼你今天忽然發起牢騷？」綺紈用手在胸口拍一拍道：「我心裏有說不出難過。」說時，又把面前一杯酒喝乾！渚齋道：「我勸你，不要再喝了。」綺紈道：「沒關係，我家裏哥哥嫂嫂都會喝酒。你也來一杯，你今晚何以如此沉悶？你再喝一杯，我還有話吿訴你。」新年雜感  徐晋　　（一）農　　休道今年是「鼠年」，城狐易逐社難遷；鄉村刧後荒涼，尙有農民盡力田。　　（二）工　　勞工神聖語非謊，物質文明此發　；最是新年建築，「百幢」　　求房荒。　　（三）商　　米珠　桂渡年關，野外哀鴻入市　；稍喜新春無異事，祗傳「美貨」濟商艱。偉大的同情  仲明　　當我們校裏發起募捐寒衣救濟難胞的運動開始的第一天，我便參加了。在這幾天之中。我走遍了上海熱鬧的市區，跑過了許多戲院和菜館，也接觸了許多上海人。　　在我們勸募工作普遍地順利進行的過程中，我發現一般富有的人倒並不如傳說中那般吝嗇和失掉同情心；相反的，當我向他們兜售「救濟票」的時候。他們都表示同情，慷慨地買上幾張。雖然有兩位同學也碰到過好幾位「例外」的人物，多半是因爲他們口袋裏「所剩無幾」，或是「早就給另一個同學來捐去了」；甚至因爲懷疑捐出的錢是否悉數加惠到難胞的身上而捐款時顯得躊躇和徬徨的，也大有人在。　　可是值得一提的，以我們工作的整個情形來看，貧窮的人們和幾位軍人所盡的力量和顯示的同情心，確乎更有過人之處。尤其是兩位小工模樣的人，於我們走過之後，還緊緊地追趕上來把袋裏的錢都捐了出來，更使我覺得可貴。另有一位軍人還這樣對我們說：「我的身體都已捐給國家了，捐幾個錢給可憐的難胞們有什麼希罕呢！」我聽了很受感動，對這位愛國愛民的軍人，起了無限的敬意。　　這兩天勸募的經過，我覺得人間有的是同情，有的是溫暖。「偉大的同情」，應該是能使世間變得美麗可愛，繁榮幸福的。　　末了，我覺得如果各學校的勸募工作好好地改良一下，使捐款的人們都能深切的信任他們所出的錢沒有一個被浪費掉，也沒有一個不是　及難胞的，那麼，救濟工作就一定會有更美滿的收獲了。兩個元旦  介丁　　轉瞬間就到了陽曆的新年。可是這個「新年」除了機關學校放假，銀行公司年度結束外，一般人總不大起勁理會，如果在農村裏，就根本看不到所謂「新年氣象」。推行了三十六年的國曆，還只能及到極小的範圍，也眞太慚愧了。　　照理，陽曆比陰曆便利得多，譬如陽曆每隔三年一「閏」，閏年不過在二月「閏」一天，不像陰曆要閏上一月，而且一定要查曆本才知道閏在那一個月；陽曆月大月小較有規則，節氣也較有定規。固然陽曆也有不合理的地方，如月份日子差別，二月太少，八月又加多一天，比陰曆總好得多。　　可是農人（不僅是農人）還是用二千年前古輩的陰曆，文人雅士也愛把「舊曆」「廢曆」稱做「夏曆」「農曆」，加上天干地支的紀年紀日。農人還是照自己的經騐看月亮斷定今天是初一月半，照舊曆播種收穫。我也是照舊曆過我的生日的。　　實在也是如此，基督敎的耶穌紀元和耶和華的安息日和包佣，佃農，小農，小店老闆發生不了關係。所以，機關學校儘放他們的假，元旦放鞭炮上戲院提燈會，一般人還是照常做他們的生意，上他們的工。倒是到了舊曆年關，結算收賬，催糧討租逼債，接利市送灶，除歲接財神，拜年做客，上燈迎神做戲，鬧元宵耍花燈，熱鬧上個把月，就是公務員學生，也不能不隨「俗」玩耍。　　以前，爲了推行國曆，舊曆新春都不放假，現在連這一點都做不到了，「春節假」也堂而皇之行起來，是拗不過農民的保守性呢，還是沒有毅力再推行下去？於是，兩個元旦還是年年慶祝，年年過兩個新年。　　舊曆勢力，其大如此。　　其實，起初要拿西洋貨的陽曆來硬送給中國農民，的確有點不可想像。中國農民沒有每七天休息一天的福氣，比擬用精確計算日子，看看月亮也就够了，一般老爺們天天可以休息，糊里糊塗過日子，也用不到陰曆。　　　制如此，其他事情何尙不是如此？照單全收式的歐化中國，在這裏又是一個慘敗。　　如果「改革」永遠如此遭遇，倒有點使人寒心。</p>

<p>元旦獻詞  程潛　　韶光容易，景物遷傳，卅六年年華，不覺匆匆的別去，民國三十七年的元旦，又忽忽的到臨，感懷過去，希望將來，眞是値得愉快和警惕。　　自政府去年頒令動員，加緊戡亂後，共匪在挫敗之餘，仍竭力掙扎，蔓延東北華北華中，陷區同胞，或流離失所，或慘遭屠殺，或被喪脅爲匪，後方同胞，也因全國總動員，一切爲勦匪，一切爲前綫，而進入戰時的體制，不能恢復平時的正常生活，安居樂業，翻開去年的日曆一看，有不少的血蹟和淚痕，哀我民衆，撫我河山，眞是無限傷心，不堪回顧。當抗戰勝利之初，，都渴望從此天下太平，寗　　人心思治　　復知有今日的慘局，現在新的一年，當然大家都有同樣的感覺，但悲哀的回顧，和慢性期待的前嘴，是不能從事建設，享受當强康樂的幸福，所以新到的這一年，能否實現這種願望，胥視全國人民能否整飭精神，共同努力戡亂。　　總動員令頒在前，政府原不願重苦人民，委曲求全，以冀共匪之感悟，結果實得其反，於是乎鞠旅陳師，大張討伐，原屬不得已的措施，國人當也深切明瞭共匪不願見國家的和平建設，所以在抗戰勝利後，即發動戰爭，擴大破壞，製造混亂，促成經濟恐怖，人心浮動，以遂其陷國家於崩潰滅亡的詭計，政府對此無人性的暴虐狂徒，豈可容忍，縱寬大爲懷，共匪本身，亦無妥協的餘地，政府和國人，祗有下以武力止戰爭，以仁慈止殘　　最大決心　　暴，以信義止狡詐，以忠勇止慄悍，以純潔止擄掠，以貞固止淫訛，才能死裏逃生，步入建國的坦途。然整飭精神，國人多不重視，以爲全國的人力物力雄厚，消滅共匪，決無疑問，而不知整飭精神，與剿匪戰亂，關聯甚爲密切，如果精神不能整飭，戡亂前途，影響甚大，無理性的共匪，牠的行爲，並不足怪，但八年抗戰，社會畸形發展，法律與道德，不免離失常軌，一般人的心理，浮動起來，因此，我於卅五年元旦獻詞警吿國人千萬不能在抗戰勝利，趾高氣揚，上自政府，下至齊民，均應憂勤惕厲，共加反省，檢査過去現在，各盡各的職責，方能消除內潛的禍亂。不意，這兩年來的情勢果然不出我的意料之外，而一般投機取巧，作奸犯科的事，層出不窮，一旦勝利到來，人心更加囂動，，貪婪無厭，　　專利爭權　　促成社會不安，秩序敗壞，　共匪以可乘之機。一個劃時代的光榮，又演成了一個劃時的慘痛。這種局面，固然是共匪喪心病狂所造成，而一般心理失常的人，又何嘗沒有責任，且在現狀下，少數爲非作歹的人，竟醉生夢死，仍不憬悟於局勢的嚴重，刀鋒已迫近眉梢，對戡亂仍漠不關心，對國家仍視若無覩，對身家禍福和永久的利害，也茫無所悉，祗專心動力於如何營私舞弊，枉法食　，如何壓榨善良，非分享受，如何保持旣得利益，百計營謀，一人如此，多數人如此，形成社會上惡勢力的集團，志意薄弱的人，受不住生活的熬煎，又叢起隨波逐浪，至於不甘墮落的人，又消極悲觀，徬徨苦悶，以致是非莫辨，正氣消沉，殊不知這正是共匪所希望，這正是替共匪帮忙，這正是　　我們檢討年來匪勢的猖獗，　　自掘墳墓　　不能迅速　平的原因，實不能不承認是社會上人心腐化惡化爲其重要的因素。　　法律與道德，是人類行為的標準，也是社會進化之所寄托。遵守法律，崇尙道德，社會才有公道，才有正氣，有公道，有正氣，決沒有無公道無正氣的共匪產生，但一般貪官汚吏，土豪劣紳，和操縱居奇的奸商，幾乎法律不能制止牠的行爲，道德不能變更牠的觀念，身心性命都不顧，要牠回到和諧與莊嚴，頗不容易，然而挽回浩刼，也祗在人的轉念間，又有甚麼難處？的心傳，祗在　　千古道統虞　　廷十六字，（人心惟危，道心惟微，惟精惟一，允執厥中。）所有法律道德，莫不以此爲基礎，誠以世間一切的問題，都含有各種因素，擴而充之，即是萬緒紛紜的事物，領而約之，仍歸於一心的妙用，從一眞以啓用，即是離人欲以合天心，人心每廳命於道心，日用倫常，自無過不及之差辨，道心建立，人類永遠共同生存於和美平等的環境中，斷不會有的大變，縱有也容易戡定，　　慘絕人寰　　即個人私欲的畸形發展，自然也用不着。現在任何人對共匪決沒有不恐怖，但對於共匪形成的原因，以及動滅的方法，國人多未領悟，這實在是很大的危機。古人說過：「攻城爲下，攻心爲上，全軍爲下，全國爲上」，這是今日戡亂的妙訣。但本人的意思，以為更要進一層　，克人爲下，克已爲上，全物爲下，全心爲上，因爲攻心全國，是向外發展的高尙戰略和政略，克己全心，是向內發展，培養宇宙的新生命。達爾文曾說過：「人類　於當前的現實，無非感性作用，而自私的心理，又從天性中帶來，所以多不能自主。」中等天資以下的人，受不了環境的壓迫與誘惑，就不免倒果爲因，道心受人心的支配，堤防一潰，又欲橫流，　有涯際，天天想　　避開慘殺　　却時時製造殺機，殺機越密，趨避愈難，醉後同歸於盡，平生私欲發展的結晶品，那時不知又在何處，所以很望大家懸崖勒馬，及早回頭，心地無非自性戒，心地無癡自性　，心地無亂自性定，不怕高千丈，只要站隱脚跟，這才是澈底的整飭精神，這才是救國族身家的根本要圖，和人生的意義，「修其天爵而人　從之」，精神與物質上的享受，同時具足，豈不甚好？不然，消滅一部份共匪，還有胸中無數的共匪，消滅一部份的燒殺淫掠，還有胸中無數的燒殺淫掠，戡亂的大事，終久不能根本解決，因爲大家不能發揮全心的力量，　　整飭精神　　而專靠物資，力量就非常薄弱，過去革命與戰勝日寇，精神力量，佔十分之七，物質力量，祗居十分之三，這是精神勝物質的證明。國父說：「革命必先革心」。「人生以服務爲目的，不以掠奪爲目的」，主席蔣公所召示國人者，可以「明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律」，數語槪括之，這些名言，正是國父與主席事功的反映，同時也是革命先烈奮鬥獨特的最高指導原則，因而革命事業，賴以發揚光大，而有我中華民國一年一度的元旦，寫成中華民國億萬斯年的輝皇歷史。現在精神潛力，雖暫時遜退，相信終必發揚。當抗戰軍興，元首奮發精神，動員應戰，天下風從。　　今日戰亂　　亦復如是。不過三寸七年，將加緊戰爭，國民生活，可能更見艱難，如果國人不招回已經失去的精神，世道人心使無法挽回，恐怕明年今日的局面，將不堪設想，但在今年的元旦，仍是希望無窮。　　卿製　兮，　慢慢兮，日月光華，且復旦兮，是古聖描寫中華民族的光明偉大悠久和太平氣象。離離原上草，一歲一榮枯，野火燒不盡，春風吹又生，是昔賢描寫中華民族的潛力雄厚，縱有危難，繼有管領春風的偉大人物，復於康平，全民蔚然興起，本人在今日隆重慶祝元旦的常中，自當體念先聖先烈和現在的元首，締造艱難，而與國人共勉之。同時，並祝中華民國萬歲！中國國民黨民萬歲！國民政府主席萬歲！普天同慶元旦夜　（本報資料室）南京夫子廟新年之熱鬧花燈（本報資料室）新歲話舊  本報資料室　　剪辮贈麵　　民國元年元旦上午十時，孫中山先生偕僚屬乘滬寗路專車赴寗，就臨時大總統職。各省代表，文武官員及男女學生四萬餘人，鵠候下關車站歡迎。專車於下午五時許抵寗。國父乘原車，由寗省軌道入城。抵站後換乘紮花馬車，偕各代表同進總統府，接見官員。晚十時，各代表公請大總統。行就職禮。是時總統府前，　懸五色電燈，各國領事，亦皆詣府道賀，門外民衆數萬人，齊呼萬歲。　　臨時政府，內設外交，陸軍，海軍，民政，財政，農工商，司法，學務大臣各一人。並即發令，改用陽曆，公布是日爲中華民國元年一月一日。　　滬軍陳都督出示　辮。有名徐志棠者，在暢園茶館內，設一義務剪髮會，凡志願入會　辮者，分文不取，並贈大肉麵一碗，以助雅興云。　　十年元旦　　民國十年元旦，上海方面，是日北風陡起，細雨濛濛，入夜雪花紛飛。城內及閘北商舖，如綢縀，洋貨，皮貨，衣裝，銀樓等店均休假，其他烟紙，食物等店，照常營業。各店門前高懸國旗。間有插白旗者，「尊重約法，反對苛雜」等字樣。　　若干學校學生是日發起組織學生監視選舉宣講國。　　上海並有兩馬路於元旦日改名。　改長浜路爲福煦路，　改徐家匯路爲海格路。　　川桂兩省取消自主代價，是日議定：善後費川百二十萬，桂五十萬，均先付半數。月餉川四十五萬，桂二十三萬，按月協濟。　　請拆電話　　十四年元旦，國父偕夫人與隨員等自天津赴北京，各團體到車站歡送者數百人，並發孫文署名之傳單，向送行道謝。車抵北京，段麒瑞之代表，內閣人員，國會議員，各校代表，均在車站迎　。隨員在車站散發巾山先生宣言書，內有「余至來京，非覓職位，或求政治權利，吾人今日仍處外國殖民地地位，吾人救國，義不容辭。至救國之方法正多，余原擬向儲君言之，第以抱恙，不得不留至異日」等語。元夕，北京，民衆舉行歡迎孫中山先生提燈會，會友並以紅燈數千，分發人力車夫‘　　上海電話公司於元旦起實行加價，華商用戶表示反對，先期致函公司請即拆除。元旦上午，電話公司分派工匠至各處拆除電話，以旅館業佔多數，酒菜茶館次之。（下接十九版）</p>

<p>各國的新年與耶穌聖誕（上接第十五版）　　（四）　　蘇聯在社會主義的旗幟下，新年別有一番景象。除了黨政要人發表新年演說，官塲，外交界例有酬酢外，工廠，農塲都普遍地舉行聯歡會，盡情作樂。　　蘇聯的國土，從遠東的太平洋沿岸，到極西的波羅的海，一面是北極最寒冷的地帶，一面又是接近熱帶的區域。當新年時，莫斯科正飛揚着棉花般的雪片，高加索南部的黑海沿岸却正過着鳥語花香的春天。同時，蘇俄人種複雜，除俄羅斯人外，又有鳥克蘭人，哈薩克人，土耳克曼人，吉耳吉斯人，蒙古人，阿斯基瑪人。因此各地新年，呈現了各民族不同的風俗，代表他們不同的情調。　　自從社會主義打倒了宗敎之後，蘇聯的耶誕節，顯然是沒有新年來得熱鬧了。但耶誕節原是仍有一部分義式沿用着。在帝俄時代的耶誕節，伊薩克大敎堂的十字行軍」式，向敎堂中走去，參加這一年一度的盛大儀式。　　和蘇聯作　居的瑞典和挪威，保留着歐洲的古風，男女老幼在新年中莫不興高彩烈地慶祝，民歌和土風舞到處演奏着。瑞典首都斯德棠摩有一個呌「卡爾得拉·康特利·索莎帝」的歌舞團體，更爲偉大。以湖光山色爲背景，在自然界的原野裏，且歌且舞，樂而忘返，這是北歐民族的新年盛會。在挪威，耶誕節那一天，充滿了熱烈的情緒。白棉花做的綵花，與窗外雪景相映成趣，此外又　上了萬國旗，電燈，蠟炬，彈奏着披亞挪。男女在神前擁抱着，孩子們戴了白蝴蝶帽子，穿上花衣，在歌舞聲中度這最歡樂的一夜。　　（五）　　現在我們的視綫且從歐洲移轉過去，看看新大陸的新年景象。在美國，可以說沒有什麼特殊的風俗，因爲她是世界上各地區，各民族所鎔鑄而成的新產品。包括了千奇百怪的風俗習慣。每年從十二月廿四日起，直到新年，整整地一個星期，眞是朝朝寒食，夜夜元宵，窮奢極侈，不愧爲金元王國。　　美國人的新年，大體說來，和英國人差不多，以耶敎儀式的禮拜爲主要項目。不過這種嚴肅的宗敎儀式，似乎與好享樂的美國人不大相配，所以這不過是一種應時的點綴。大多數的美國人，却從另外各方面去找尋作樂的方法。　　電影，戲劇，　樂，是最普通的娛樂，那天，不論在都市裏，市鎭上，大小戲院，莫不客滿，座劵預售一空。各種球類比賽與跑馬，是愛好運動朋友們的玩意兒。興致高的靑年，在街上結隊遊行，一排排的氣球，一陣陣的花雨，高唱應時歌曲，倒是很够味的。　　美國曾有一度禁酒，但他們對於酒却最最愛好。在不禁酒的時候，醉漢們手握着酒瓶，羣集街頭，喝着酒，唱着歌，手舞足蹈，通宵達旦。喝醉了，就在她上麟下去，繁察們弄得無法去維持秩序。夜總會，酒吧間中，更是擴得滿滿地，在醉鄕中度了他們的佳節。　　（六）　　新年在亞洲，　敎的色彩顯得淡薄得多了，代替他的，是東方情調的古風。　　佛敎發源地的印度，新年習俗以佛爲主體。除夕室內必須掛上一　「快樂燈」，這是儀節隆重的一幕。點燈前要拜佛，求他保佑，點燈更要虔誠，不能笑，舉動也不可輕浮，否則就有災害降臨。元旦早上，每個印度人必須到廟中去參拜，參拜前要洗澡，以免把不潔的身體去　　菩薩。參拜時衣服穿得越少越好，甚至有裸體參拜的。　　回敎的伊朗，以火爲最光明的東西敬神求福，必須燃火。在送舊迎新的新年中，火是最吉祥的了。除夕，家家戶戶，門口燃火，闔家人就圍着火跪拜，求神賜福。燃火往往會引起火災，但火災發生後，非但沒有人前去搶救，大家竟拍手而觀，認爲這一家敬神不虔，神來處罰，所以會遭回祿之災。　　日本人的新年，有一點和中國相像。新年未到，松枝是早已預備下了。在大門的兩旁，栽着兩株松枝，綴上一些竹和梅花。用歲寒三友來點綴新年，十足是中國風味。門框上掛稻草結，中央釘上一隻結子，糊點白紙條，使家中變爲一個神聖所在，妖魔不敢侵入。元旦早晨要看日出，大家天未明就起來了，到較高的地方去望太陽，表示一年的命運，有似旭日初升一般。祭神也必不可少，在神　前，供著兩塊年糕做的鏡餅，　畢，一家人就分吃，以視一　如　。每個人還要喝一　酒，可　　氣，島國新年尙帶著古代神秘的意味。　　（七）　　被人稱爲「黑暗世界」的非洲，是一片荒凉沙漢，使人感到焦躁不安的心情。他們在外人侵略之下，渦着痛苦的生活。只有逢到節日，才得歡樂一下，解除那心頭上的　結。　　非洲土地，大部份是殖民地，新年風俗，也隨着異族的統治而落沒了。眞正非洲的新年，祗有在土著中去找尋。滯留在部落生活中的土入，過新年時，酋長要舉行大檢閱，開大宴會，各院商人都要來趕市，遊客們紛紛參加。宴會時也有歌舞，彩騎飛馳，揮動刀劍，與鼓聲相呼應，此乃原始時代的遺風。　　撤哈拉沙漠爲遊牧民族的世界，回敎商人的駱駝隊來往甚忙。元旦淸晨，也們要走出自己的篷帳，向東方叩頭禮拜。待太陽在東方透了起來，他們開始歌舞，賭博，沙漠中的下午，太陽是夠怕人的，但那裏有美麗的綠洲男女，在駱駝背上悠然高歌，倒影池中，更顯得沙漠中綠洲的可愛了。長春年畫，滿街琳琅　（本報資料室）中華民三十六　國內外大事記（上接第十九版）　　二十四日張羣飛台視察中菲友好條約在馬尼刺交換批准書　　二十五日台灣慶祝光復節　　二十六日國府選任黃紹竑丁惟汾顏惠慶爲府委　　二十七日中美救濟協定在京簽字蔣主席偕夫人飛牯王世杰返抵京　內政部宣佈民盟爲非法團體　　二十八日王世杰飛牿謁主席報吿出國經過　　二十九日美衆議員周以德抵京　　三十日遼北國軍收復昌岡二十三國代表在日內瓦簽訂多邊性關稅協定　　三十一日美向聯合國建議巴基斯坦明年七月分治　　十一月　　一日長春四平國軍會師土總統伊諾努指責蘇聯對土無理要求　　二日四平國軍開抵長春永吉周　匪勢動搖英國市政　　在日美議員周以德謁蔣主席印度發生內戰喀什米爾情勢緊急　　四日　楡林攻防戰激烈蔣主席手令中央選舉指導會候選人名單須呈奉覆核　　五日民盟宣吿解散　美國務院宣布救濟糧食即運來華　　六日國民黨國代候選人名單送　總審審核公布蘇聯十月革命三十週年紀念莫洛托夫提出警告謂原子彈已無秘密存在　　七日豫西國軍克復實豐盧氏澳科學家利用雷達探測月球獲得初步成功　　八日蔣主席召見政府要員指示選務蘇聯反對我國參預擬訂對德和約　　九日馬歇爾向國會報吿美國援華數字靑年黨國代候選人名單送選總公布暹羅突起政變總理鑾丹龍被俘鑾披汶執政　　十日蔣總裁指示黨員工作囑勿以競選爲榮馬歇爾在國會解釋緊急援歐計劃內容阿斐璜組織暹羅新內閣　　十一日蔣主席放棄國代競選　　十二日湘鄂贛豫皖蘇六省主席在京商討聯防問題聯大會討論制裁西班牙朗哥政　問題　　十三日　石家莊失守鳥克　當選安理會理事　　十四日民社黨國代候選人名單送選總公布六省聯防會議閉幕顧維鈞訪馬歇爾討論經濟援華　　十五日　徐州外圍激戰聯大通過設立聯合國委員團監督朝鮮完成獨立　　十六日榆林外　國軍大捷　　十七日北平舉行軍事會議商討冀察聯防美國會召開特別會議討論援歐及國內經濟問題　　十八日行政院通過剿匪方案馬歇爾發表演說闡明美國外交政策　　十九日我政府向美蘇英建議召開對日和約預備會該　　二十日法總理賴馬迪辭職勃魯姆奉命組閣英儲君伊麗莎白與蒙巴頓上尉結婚　　二十一日國大代表開始選舉運續三天馬歇爾抵倫敦出席四國外長會議　　二十二日　海路上國軍會師肅淸沿綫散匪法議會否決勃魯姆組閣許曼奉命組閣　　二十三日國代普選順利完成英洛托夫抵倫敦出席四國外長會議　　二十四日魯西國軍進駐魚台第二屆遠東經濟會議在碧瑤開幕　　二十五日白崇禧赴合肥部署華中剿匪軍事四國外晨會議在倫敦揭幕（下接第廿一版）</p>

<p>憲政肇端  洪蘭友　　日月不居，又屆新年，逢茲元且之辰，亦即中華民　成立三十六屆紀念之日，仰念國父與諸先烈創建民國之　功偉績，緬思三十七年來本黨肩荷民主建國使命之艱辛，其所經歷之險阻　途，於此偉大之民主建國之日，吾人不禁欣然知所興，更凜然知所勉。　　辛亥革命，與今日之行憲，絕對爲一事，實現民主政治，爲國父學生所從事之遠大目標，亦爲國父交給本黨同志之重大責任，不但本黨之主義如是，即全國國民之信念亦如是。中華民國之由來，實即三民主義民主革命之產物，中國民主憲政之運動，歷五十餘年之長期苦鬥，經無數先烈之流血犧牲，始有今日實施憲政之成果。際此萬象更新之時會，願全國同胞體認民主建國之艱巨，努力完成憲政之盛業，奠民國於長治久安，方不負諸先烈之犧牲，而有以慰國父在天之靈。　　前年十一月十五日，國民大會開會於首都，在四十餘日中完成中華民國憲法，集各地方，各民族，各職業各黨派之菁英，完成此一新時代之根本大法，實嚝代之盛典，亦已奠定中華民國憲政之始基。　　一部中華民國憲政史，實包含無數之苦辛，遠者姑不置諭，即以最近十餘年歷史言之：憲法之　訂，遠在民國二十五年五月五日，即已開始，其時吾人正將制定憲法之時，日寇突然侵戰，掀起全國偉大之神聖抗戰，送致停頓，抗戰勝利之後，繼以黨派協商，中間又經過若干稽延頓挫，卒以本　還政於民之決心，克服任何艱阻，終能完成制憲之大業。吾人回溯制憲工作之艱難，應益　於行憲職責之重大。自前年以至今日共匪之叛亂，日以加厲，政府以戡亂與行憲同時進行，建國工作實爲一體，而於戡亂之中，求憲治之實現，更覺其意義與使命之重大，凡我同胞應以熱忱毅力，擁護政府，迅速達成戡亂之任務，俾憲政障礙，悉以掃除，而奠國家民族於萬世不拔之域。　　方今憲政肇端之時，正民主建國之始，今後民權更加大其發展，使全國逐漸以法治保障人權，以憲政切求統一，而以全國所選舉之民意代表，爲政治推進之中心動力，則政治必可淸明，由人民總意所構成之國民大會，以選舉之國家元首，必能公正而賢明。由人民直接選舉之立法委員所決定之政策，必能反映全國人民之公意，而得其擁護，易於實施。由省民間接選舉之監察委員，尤必能　　代表人民爲行政之雖瞥，以收澄淸政治之效。至於政治制度，吾人希望於制與衡之原則下，能使國策之旅行，爲靈活之運用，則政黨之和協合作，尤爲今後建國順利推行之前提。　　抑尤有進者，民主政治之推行，必須以法治爲基礎，今日英美之民主政治，所以能爲全世取法者，蓋由其百年以上之法治習慣與發統。吾人實行民主憲政，必不可撇開法治，凡無維特法紀，奉行法治之誠意，甚至毀法亂紀者，直民主憲政之罪人，回憶三十六年前之今日，正中華民國成立之時，設無袁世凱及北洋軍閥之破壞民國法紀，則光華燦燜之民主的中華民國，早已完成憲政雄立於大地之上，故今日全國上下必須有維護法紀，奉行法治之誠意，始能達到眞正的民主憲政之途，是則於制憲回顧與行憲展望之餘，所寄無涯之希冀者，大易之象有剝斯復，否極則泰，國運之昌隆，必將待吾人之奮鬥而臻於實現，用特於新年獻其所見，共勉於憲政法治之力行，使我全國國民數十年來所艱苦制定之憲法，得以順利實施，是今年今日之所預說，必於明年今日慶吿成功者也。中華民國三十六　年國內外大事記（上接第廿版）　　二十六日蔣主席飛北平巡視美衆院外交委員會通過六千萬美元援華案　　二十七日九江指揮部成立法工潮擴大　　二十八日蔣主席在北平主持陸空軍事檢討會議國務會議通過立監委選舉展期舉行蘇聯建議在中國召開四外長特別會議討論對日和約　　二十九日蔣主席返京聯大通過巴勒斯坦分治計劃　　三十日傅作義受任華北剿匪總總司令聯合國大會閉幕　　十二月　　一日皖西國軍克復立煌太湖聯合國遠東經濟會議否決印尼列席案　　二日行政院決議在滬。津。穗。漢四市設金融管　局巴動斯坦全境發生暴動　　三日美衆院外交委員會提出報吿，力主緊急援助歐亞　　四日全國經濟委員會通過調整國內匯率豫南展開會戰美衆院討論緊急援外法案　　五日行政院通過卅七年上半年度國家總預算　　六日政府對蘇聯所提召開對日和會之　文送達蘇聯政府遠東經濟會議閉幕　　七日外交部發表聲明重申我國對召開對日和會之立塲　　八日中美海軍協定在首都簽字南匈簽訂軍事互助條約　　九日行政院通過省縣自治通則草案英大使施諦文訪王世杰商談九龍城問題　　十日財政部發行票面一千二千及五千之關金券馬歇爾要求蘇聯停止攫取德境物資　　十一日郵電實行加價美衆院通過對中法義奧五億九千萬援助案英王批准緬甸錫蘭獨立　　十二日國務會議通過訓政結束程序法案法議會通過支持許曼總理對蘇聯採强硬政策　　十三日美兩院聯席會議商定我國列爲受助國家英國拒絕在華召開對日和會　　十四日蘇聯宜布改革幣制　　十五日東北行轅召開軍事檢討會議美國會核准對中法義奧援助法案　　十六日東北大戰揭開」倫敦四外畏會議破裂莫洛托夫返莫斯科　　十七日全國經濟委員會　　方案加　棉花紗布管制　　門　　緊急援歐救濟法案　　十八日四聯總處理事會決議鐵停貸款王世杰約晤司徒　登商談　　十九日瀋陽外團激戰杜魯門向國會提出長期援歐計劃。　　二十日美國會通過對華貨款一千八百萬美元馬歇爾廣播　責蘇　　德國無統一希望　　二十一日蔣主席發表耶　廣播政府令馮玉祥返國塔虎特反對長期援歐計　　將破壞美國經濟　　二十二日立法院制定結束訓政程序日戰犯東條受審　　二十三日行政院通過加强管制金融業務辦法蔣主席召見西北將領商討軍事防務問題　　二十四日法國民議會通過反通貨膨脹法案　　二十五日憲法開始實行國府頒布國民大會定明年三月廿九日召開　　二十六日全國開始監委選舉日戰犯東條受審　　二十七日選舉總事務所公布政黨立委候選人名單英蘇貿易協定在莫斯科簽字　　二十八日蔣主席飛漢口瀋陽展開攻防戰　　二十九日蔣主席返京美前副總統華萊士宣布參加總統競選　　三十日行政院通過飾金自由買賣羅馬尼亞國王退位改爲共和政體　　三十一日蔣主席發表三十七年元旦廣播訓詞</p>

<p>慶祝開國與慶祝行憲  方治　　今天是中華民國卅七年元風，是我們國父領導革命，推翻滿淸帝制，建立中華民國的開國紀念日，又是開始行憲，全中國人民，從此走上民主自由幸編康樂的大道，展開新的國運的一年。在弔民救國，全國上下正動員戡亂的今天，我們面臨此雙重慶典，我們緬懷旣往，五十年的艱難奮鬥，今天終於達到了我們革命的還政于民，實行全民政治的目的，我們眞是歡欣鼓舞，普天同慶，但我們盱衡時勢，瞻念來茲，尤深感未來責任的艱巨，我們更該怎樣的奮發努力，以完成我們革命未竟的全功。　　中國自從滿淸入關，全國同胞，淪於專制政體的鐵蹄之下，受盡痛苦，歷盡磨折，過着牛馬的非人生活者達二百餘年，國一父爲救國救民，領導革命，以其大智大仁大勇，奔走呼號，雖歷十次的失敗，而亦不能稍挫其志，於是，終在辛亥武昌一役，推倒根深蒂固的滿淸帝制，救全國同胞於水火，開創中華民國，在中華民族史上，永遠留下今天這光榮的一頁。　　民國成立以後，到今天三十餘年，君主的專制政體，雖然推翻。但軍閥割據，强鄰侵略，又接踵而起，三十餘年來，可以說沒有一天不是在作革命與反革命，民主與反民主的鬥爭，如討袁北閥，剿匪抗戰，國父領導於前，主席繼承於後，艱難奮鬥，堅苦卓絕，始終爲爭取國家的獨立自由平等，建立民治民有民　的三民主義新中國而努力，在這樣內憂外患國難重重中，而終于在前年之艱難中完成制憲，今年又在這樣匪亂中行憲，我們政府，堅良奮鬥，爲民主憲政努力的苦心和精神，是値得我們感謝和欽佩的，同時，到今天，我們國父畢生革命努力的目的，本黨五十餘年來犧牲奮鬥的職志，與夫全國人民所旦夕以求的願望——實行憲政，是以事實昭吿國人了。　　這是中國三千年來政治史上一劃時代的進步和成功，從此我們可以看到民主憲政的光輝，我們可以切實享受到民主憲政的幸福，我們的公民權利和義務，有了保障，我們的國家民族，從此是一個有生命有活力的整理。主席在去年耶穌聖誕節廣播詞中昭示我們說：「中華民國卅六年，就是耶穌降生一九四七年的聖誕節，將是我們中華民國和全體人民統一獨立平等自由新生機運肇始的一天，我們新憲法的特點，就是它保證把基督敎理基本要素，即個人的尊嚴與目由，普遍的給與我們全國同胞，這個新憲法確認了全國國民的各種權利，在國家統一與自由之下之一個自申人民的精神的孕育的誕生」。我們回溯過去五十餘年革命奮鬥的艱苦，瞻望今後的光明前途，在我們舉行慶祝的今天，我們眞是沒有辦法形容我們內心的讚頒，歡欣和感奮。　　但是，我們在熱烈慶祝行憲的今天，我們也更該警惕到五十餘年來革命所遭遇的反革命反統一反民主，毀法亂紀，禍國殃民的力量，今天正囂張於東北和其他的國土上，在那些所謂「解放區」裏，我們的同胞不但看不到民主憲政的光輝，受不到民主憲政的溫情，而且在共匪的鐵蹄下，身家生命，也隨時是可以被毀滅的，我們如果一天沒有剿滅共匪，那不但我們憲政的恩惠，不能普沾於全國同胞，而且，我們的全民政治的具體精神，也無由表現，過去幾十年來，由於一般反革命的封建力量的障礙，以致使得民元的臨時約法和過去一切的自治法典的未能澈底實施，這就是我們今天的前車之鑒，同時，今天的共匪，他已不但是行憲的障礙，更是背叛國家違反憲法的亂臣賊子。憲法是我們全國人民所共制共守的國家根本法典，凡是違反憲法的，就是背棄全國人民，因此，，共匪更已是我們全國人民的公敵。　　我們爲維護憲法，爲確切保證憲法的普遍澈底實行，爲消減傷害我們自由幸福的民族國家的叛徒在行憲的今天，我們要以十二萬分的眞誠也就是十二萬分的迫切，我們要求加緊戡亂行動，我們全人民，全國企求民主自由的同胞，應該一致奮起，在政府的號召下，動員一切人力物力，加強我們剿匪戡亂的軍事政治經濟文化，以至於道德人心，而加速我們戡亂工作的成功，那末，也就是使得我們民主憲政的光輝，早一日能普遍地照耀於全國。一今天，我們慶祝行憲，我們以欣悅的心情來近接未來的光明，但是我們也該認識，制憲難，行憲尤其不易，我們應該警惕到今天的行憲是我們爲民主憲政奮鬥成功的第一步，我們的前路，仍然是荆棘滿途，我們應該發揚五十餘年來革命犠牲奮鬥的精神，來掃除行憲的一切障礙，來維護憲法，以完成我們三民主義新中國的建設，主席去年耶穌聖一誕廣播中說：「我認爲新憲法的實施，祗是完成我們建設新中國最後目標的初步」。這是在歡欣鼓舞，萬般興奮，熱烈的慶祝開國，慶祝行憲的今天，我們所應該深加警惕，深加檢討和深加努力的。行憲與戡亂　上海市各界慶祝中華民國開國三十七年暨行憲大會吿市民書　　全市同胞們！　　今天是中華民國開國三十七週年紀念日，也是行憲實施後的第一個元旦，我們在全國動員戡亂的時候，來紀念這個佳節良辰，同時又慶祝行憲，實在有特殊重大的意義。　　當此行憲之初，我們要深切了解建國必先行憲，憲法是人民權利的保障，實施憲政可以增進人們福利，維護社會安全，我們要樹立公正的輿論，養成守法的精神，選舉賢能，行使政權以實施憲政爲職志。我們更要澈底認淸行憲必先戡亂，共匪稱兵作亂，倒行逆施，前年反對國大，度對制憲，看到制憲成功，不惜狐注一擲，發動武裝的全面叛亂，破壞統一，阻撓行憲。自政府於去年頒仙全國總動員令後，半年來的剿匪軍事進展極為順利，共匪必敗，戡亂必成，我們要竭誠擁護政府實施憲政戡亂建國的國策。總之建國必先行憲，行憲必先戡亂，是我們今天慶祝元旦暨行憲時應有的基本認識。　　憲治肇始，百度維新，我們上海市民應當如何努力呢？　　第一，確保地方治安：共匪過去製造工潮學潮，以擾亂治安，破壞秩序，自總動員令頒佈後，表面雖已撤退，實際仍有潛伏，我們要加强民衆訓練，嚴密保甲組織，建立自衛武力，號召共匪自新，確保上海的安定。　　第二，慰勞戡亂將士：國軍將士剿匪戡亂，轉　征戰，歷盡苦辛，我們對於渦境出征的部隊和新兵，本巿征募的志願兵，以及留醫的榮軍，應當熱烈誠摯的招待他們，慰勞他們，做到前綫與後方一體，軍隊與民衆一家，　　第三，厲行節約消費：政府對於厲行節約消費，倡導已久，各項辦法，分別訂定，我們要持續不斷的努力，以節省物力，財力，减少消費，充實戡亂建國的力量。　　四，加緊救濟災黎：時屆冬令，氣候張寒，一般貧苦無依的災黎，缺衣乏食，啼飢呼寒，我們應當基於人類的同情心，踴躍輸將，救濟他們，使免於飢寒的痛苦。　　同胞們，今年是行憲開始年。剿匪軍事的最後勝利，指日可期，民主憲政的遠大前途，光芒萬丈。我們要統一意志，集中力量，圍結精神，在蔣主席的領導之下削平匪患，建立民有民治民事的三民主義新中國。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Entering the Constitutional Era This Year: Chairman's Broadcast Proclaims to the Nation, Unite to Destroy National Enemies <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang issued a New Year's Day broadcast address to the military and civilians of the entire country on New Year's Eve, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, military and civilians across the country, today is the founding anniversary of the 37th year of the Republic of China. Since its founding, the Republic of China has suffered continuous internal and external troubles. After a long period of dangers and difficulties, all our countrymen, under the leadership of the Founding Father and the guidance of his last will, have worked together, persevered, destroyed the remnants of the imperial system, eliminated feudal strongholds, and defeated invading countries. This year, the Republic of China has finally entered the constitutional era. We can say that this year is the year of constitutional rule, and today is the first day of the year of constitutional rule. On this first day of the year of constitutional rule, I first hope that all my countrymen will remember the difficulties of the martyrs in creating the Republic, fulfill the duties of citizens of a democratic country, uphold the Constitution, and implement constitutional government to establish an unshakable foundation for the country forever. At the same time, we should also observe the country's current environment and the crises facing the nation, understand the greater good, distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, unite our efforts, and work together to continue the spirit of the fifty years of National Revolution and the eight years of war against Japan, to jointly fight against the common enemies of the nation and to work together to eliminate the country's worries.</p>
<p>Today is the third New Year's Day since the victory of the War of Resistance. During our country's eight-year war against Japan, the military and civilians across the country spared no sacrifice, endured unparalleled suffering, originally to protect the country's independence and freedom, and also to crush the Japanese imperialists' poisonous plan to divide our country, destroy our unity, and hinder our construction, in order to exterminate our nation's survival. Our countrymen endured hardship and pain, sacrificed and struggled, originally hoping to have the opportunity to recuperate, live and work in peace after the victory, so that our nation could be revitalized and the country could become strong. Unexpectedly, during the eight-year War of Resistance, when our countrymen were bleeding for a long time, the communist bandits carried out their rebellion to subvert the country, endanger the nation, and disrupt the whole country from beginning to end. On the one hand, they cooperated with the government on the surface, expressing their unity in resisting Japan, and on the other hand, they tried their best to avoid war, secretly reaching an understanding with the enemy and not invading each other, concentrating on maintaining their territory and expanding their strength. When the War of Resistance was victorious, they suddenly launched a rebellion, destroying unity, and losing the opportunity for our nation's rejuvenation and the good opportunity for our country's construction, hindering the revitalization and harming the people's livelihood, so that our countrymen, who survived the disaster, were once again in an environment without constitution and without hope of recovery. Our countrymen in the bandit areas who were oppressed by the communist bandits not only experienced the displaced lives of the War of Resistance period, but also suffered disasters that were more unbearable than the rape, murder, and enslavement by the Japanese pirates during the War of Resistance. Today, under the influence of the bandit rebellion, the livelihood of the general public across the country is becoming increasingly difficult, and they are constantly oppressed, unable to breathe a sigh of relief. Those who have escaped from the bandit areas, carrying the old and leading the young, are hungry and cold, and have nowhere to turn. Especially those who are trapped in the bandit areas and cannot escape the clutches, their plight of having no way to survive and no way to die, and living in darkness, cannot be described in words. The country has suffered such disasters and the people have suffered such trauma, which is an unprecedented catastrophe in our country's history of survival. On this New Year's Day, Zhongzheng deeply feels the responsibility and is deeply saddened by the suffering of our countrymen. The thoughts and grief in my heart cannot be expressed in words.</p>
<h3 id="e2">National Equality and Freedom Must Take Unity and Independence as Prerequisites: Points Out the Responsibilities of Compatriots in Saving the Nation and Themselves <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>We are now entering the era of democratic constitutionalism, but democratic politics must take national equality and freedom as a prerequisite, and national equality and freedom must take national unity and independence as a prerequisite. Only when the people of the whole country abide by the laws and regulations, uphold unity, and strive for independence can we build a free, democratic and glorious country. If our China cannot be unified, the survival of the nation will lose its guarantee, if the country cannot be unified, economic construction cannot be promoted, and if the country cannot be unified, democratic constitutionalism cannot be implemented. The communist bandits today are shamelessly claiming that their rebellion and arson are patriotic, and even more ridiculously, they are using their strict blockade and creation of terror as democracy. In fact, everyone knows that the communist bandits have absolutely no country, no nation, and absolutely no democracy or freedom in their minds. A year ago, the communist bandits had already opposed the National Assembly and denied the Constitution, trampling on democracy. In the past year, they have been using the division of territory, usurpation of sovereignty, subjugation of China, and destruction of the nation as the goals of their armed rebellion. In order to carry out these unspeakable goals, they have not hesitated to desecrate our national soil. Economically and socially, they are undermining our social and economic foundations. For the entire country, they want to exterminate China's excellent culture and ethics, and eliminate China's five thousand years of long and glorious history. They violate human nature and create division. They destroy unity and ruin construction. What they want is the people's poverty and death, not the people's peace and survival. Wherever the bandit army goes, they universally launch struggles, creating hatred between people. The "land revolution" they advocate actually directs unemployed vagrants and local bullies to control the entire countryside, oppressing honest farmers. They even do not hesitate to destroy human reason, create a crazy psychology, and practice cruel terror to fuel the cruel struggle between people. The various atrocities committed by the communist bandits in the bandit areas prove that they not only want to make our country not a country, but also want to make our people not people. The communist bandits encourage fratricide and cultivate parricide in the bandit areas, forcing women to join the army, glorifying them as team members, but in reality using them as tools for the lust of communist party cadres. Even more heartbreaking is that every child must be incorporated into the Young Pioneers, training them to spy on families, hate their fathers and brothers, and commit crimes against humanity. His atrocities can be summarized in three sentences: First, in order to eliminate the people's concept of the country, they want to destroy families and exterminate human relations. Second, in order to destroy social order, they want to incite hatred and advocate deception. Third, in order to carry out class dictatorship, they want to create terror and destroy democracy. The communist bandits regard sin as virtue and deception as loyalty. They use all means to achieve their goals and have no sense of shame towards people. They use all kinds of means to eliminate our nation's life, destroy our society's livelihood, and endanger our country's survival. Their malicious intentions are even greater than the Japanese pirates' invasion. The Japanese pirates' invasion was only an external aggression, while today's communist bandits' betrayal of the country is an internal rebellion with external aggression characteristics. If such heinous crimes are allowed to continue without suppression, our country will inevitably die, and our people will be reduced to beasts of burden for others to enslave. Where is there any freedom to speak of, and even less hope for democratic constitutionalism? Fellow countrymen, as long as you visit the refugee countrymen who have fled from the bandit areas, ask if there is any intellectual in the bandit areas who can survive without being killed by the communist bandits. Wherever the communist bandits have passed, is there any hole that can be spared, is there anyone who can live freely without being oppressed by the communist bandits as a sacrificial lamb? Therefore, it can be known that our current military suppression of bandits is a war to save the country and the people, a war to save the country against harming the country, a war to build against destruction, a war of freedom against enslavement, a war of light against darkness, and a war of democratic constitutionalism against class dictatorship. This is indeed the key to the fundamental safety of the country and the dividing line between the nation's century-long prosperity and decline. Therefore, today I want to review the situation of the military suppression of bandits since last year for my countrymen, review the economic crisis caused by the communist bandits' rebellion, and point out the responsibilities that my patriotic countrymen should fulfill in saving the country and saving themselves in the future.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang, on the occasion of New Year's Day of the 37th year, to express his gratitude to the officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines for their hard work, has issued condolences to the officers and soldiers of various units, and distributed to the wounded and disabled officers and soldiers two coarse towels per person, one tube of toothpaste, one bar of soap, two boxes of cigarettes, and one catty of meat (cash equivalent to 22,000 yuan). (The above items are under preparation and will be distributed in succession). In addition, the Ministry of National Defense stipulates: A. According to the number of people accommodated in each hospital (including wounded and sick soldiers from other units and the Southern Jiangsu Army), the Welfare Personnel Committee and the hospital will jointly compile a list of wounded and sick soldiers who were admitted to the hospital before New Year's Day. Those who have been discharged from the hospital but have not yet arrived at their units, after being certified by the original hospital, can still apply for the benefits. B. Military and civilian personnel who have been transferred to other units or are on leave are also required to compile a detailed list and distribute the benefits uniformly. These benefits have been prepared by the Ministry of National Defense and will be distributed or paid in cash separately.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, unknown location, 30th] Chairman Chiang was very pleased with the significant drop in prices in unknown location (see the first page of yesterday's newspaper and the second page of today's newspaper). On the 30th, he severely rewarded the commander of the area and instructed him to reward the meritorious officers and soldiers, which will be done on New Year's Day.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Review of the Military Situation: National Army Has Completed Strategic Objectives, Pursuing and Suppressing Wandering Bandits in the Interior <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>When we review the military suppression of bandits in the past year, we must first point out that before the promulgation of the mobilization order for the war, the government was extremely tolerant and exhausted all means to avoid war. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the government has stopped conscription. The original officers and soldiers have been reorganized and greatly reduced. Before June of last year, in order to understand the people's suffering and preserve the country's vitality, our national army had never taken active military action against the communist bandits. On the contrary, the communist bandits launched rebellions repeatedly in the bandit areas, and while the government loved peace and was unprepared for war, they took advantage of loopholes everywhere, expanded the scope of their rebellions, and strengthened their rebellious forces. The general public did not clearly understand the communist bandits' tricks, and even after the promulgation of the mobilization order for the war in July, they were still confused by the communist bandits' reactionary propaganda. Especially in the rear provinces and cities, spies ran rampant, rumors arose frequently, and various chaotic and complex phenomena were difficult to clarify. Therefore, mobilization could not be thoroughly implemented, and the military suppression of bandits could not achieve complete success. Under these circumstances, the front-line national army has been fighting passively and in isolation, resulting in repeated losses within a year, and the generals and soldiers have been very tired. However, under these extremely difficult combat conditions, the national army has already completed its greatest task on the battlefield and overcome the greatest difficulties. The first is the occupation of Yan'an, the location of the communist bandits' headquarters. The second is that the old nest in the Yimeng Mountain area was completely destroyed by our national army and recovered by our national army. The third is that the main force of the bandit party in the interior has been continuously pursued and destroyed by our national army, making it unable to stand firm. Their conspiracy to occupy North China and divide the country has also been shattered by our national army. Everyone knows that Yan'an has been the communist bandits' base for more than ten years, and their base for dividing North China. The Yimeng Mountain area is the communist bandits' general warehouse for manufacturing military equipment and storing military supplies. Yantai on the Shandong Peninsula is the communist bandits' only maritime transportation and supply line to the outside world. However, our national army, relying on the spirit of loyalty, courage, and righteousness, built its most dangerous target in terms of terrain and most difficult in terms of combat. Finally, it recovered Yan'an, swept away the Yimeng Mountain area, and finally recovered Yantai, gradually destroying the nest that the communist bandits had managed for many years, the supplies they had accumulated, and the headquarters they relied on to call on all the bandit troops. From then on, the communist bandits' so-called political center and nerve center were lost, the economic lifeline on which they depended for survival was destroyed, and their final sea port for external communication was cut off. The price paid by the national army was indeed huge, but the expected strategic goal has been completed as scheduled in the past year. The bandit army in the interior has been hit hard, unable to stand firm, and unable to resist stubbornly. It has to be forced to disperse and become bandits. Although the bandit troops led by Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are still rampant and scurrying, their wandering south of the Yellow River has turned them into thieves without nests and rats without holes. There is no purpose in front of them and no way back behind them. They can only be beaten blindly. The national army will be able to pursue, suppress, and eliminate these bandit troops more easily. It can be said that the most difficult work in the entire bandit suppression campaign has already been completed in the past year. Everyone knows that before July, the bandit army in the interior was completely active in resisting stubbornly and was determined not to give up their bases and flee en masse. However, after our national army began to suppress them in July, they could not hold on and had to flee to avoid war. The national army has moved from the defensive stage to the suppression stage, and recently has entered the pursuit stage. Under this situation, in order to escape their final fate of destruction, the communist bandits have recently restored their hideous faces from the Jiangxi era. In the bandit areas they occupy, regardless of villages or cities, they use methods such as confiscation, liquidation, and review to impose endless oppression and exploitation on all men, women, old, and young, and use methods of struggle and massacre to drive the entire population to completely sacrifice themselves for their rebellion. These increasingly extreme and heinous acts of the communist bandits can also prove that they are at the end of their rope and have reached the final stage. I want to explain to everyone that although the bandit troops led by Liu Bocheng are still scurrying in the Dabie Mountains, vainly trying to rebuild their base in Central China, and the bandit troops led by Chen Yi in western Henan and eastern Henan are still destroying transportation, trying to hinder our national army's pursuit and suppression in order to prolong their remaining lives, but the national army has completed the preparations for the entire bandit suppression plan in the past six months. It is firmly believed that all the bandit army's various attempts will be shattered and all their fantasies will become bubbles. As for the bandit army in the Northeast, although they launched attacks rashly, the national army, which has been fighting in the Northeast for a long time, in order to protect the territorial sovereignty of the Northeast, all officers and soldiers will spare no sacrifice, double their loyalty and courage, and fight the bandits to the end, until the territorial sovereignty is completely recovered. This is a glimpse of the current military situation of bandit suppression that I want to clearly point out to my countrymen across the country. (Continued on the first column of the second page)</p>

<h3 id="e7">New Year's Greetings to Constitutional Rule <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic of China was promulgated on New Year's Day last year and came into effect on December 25th. Today is New Year's Day of the 37th year, exactly one year from the date of the Constitution's promulgation and a full week from the date of its implementation. This year should be a "year of constitutional rule" in name and in fact. On New Year's Day of the year of constitutional rule, we should first sincerely and respectfully wish the smooth implementation of the Constitution.</p>
<p>According to Article 1 of the Constitution, "The Republic of China, based on the Three Principles of the People, is a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people." Therefore, the Constitution is truly a symbol of our country's implementation of democratic politics. The value of the Constitution lies not in its 175 articles, but in the spirit contained in these articles, which is the spirit of democracy. If we want constitutional rule to be smooth, we must first strive to cultivate the democratic spirit of every citizen. Only when everyone, from the head of state to high officials, and from peddlers to hawkers, possesses that most precious democratic spirit, can the Constitution have its supreme dignity and authority.</p>
<p>So what is the spirit of democracy? Simply put, the difference between democracy and dictatorship is that the former allows opposing opinions while the latter does not, the former persuades opponents with reason while the latter uses violence to stop them. Therefore, whether the Constitution can be implemented, and whether it can be implemented smoothly, depends on how our government and society, officials and people, express their opinions and promote their policies on any proposal or measure in the future. If we can truly follow the method of discussion in meetings, allowing both those who agree and those who disagree to have a reasonable opportunity for debate, on the one hand, we must never harbor prejudiced views of dominance and servitude, and never casually use force to prohibit the discussions of dissidents; on the other hand, we must never be stubborn or extreme, and only regard opposition or destruction as ability, but be able to obey the final decision of the majority, then we can hope to enter the realm of democracy. On the contrary, if we still follow the old habits, unwilling to use reason to convince others, such as some officials in the past who were never willing to hear opposing discussions in the parliament, and occasionally became angry when debating; or like the communists today, who oppose political enemies not by arguing with words and pens, but must resort to war and meet the national army on the battlefield with pleasure, these are all lacking the cultivation of democratic spirit. We wish everyone to wash away these old stains of self-centeredness and arrogance, and do their best to cultivate the seedlings of democratic spirit, so that constitutional rule can be smooth.</p>
<p>Secondly, what democratic countries value most is the freedom and rights of the people. In our country's Constitution, all the people's freedom of person, freedom of residence and movement, freedom of speech, teaching, writing, and publication, freedom of secret communication, freedom of religious belief, freedom of assembly and association, as well as the people's right to survival, right to work, and right to property, etc., have been detailed in Chapter II, and "unless necessary to prevent obstruction of the freedom of others, avoid emergency dangers, maintain social order, or promote public interests, it shall not be restricted by law" (see Article 23). If public officials illegally infringe upon them, they shall be subject to disciplinary action and bear criminal and civil liability, and the victimized people may also request compensation from the state (see Article 24). It can be seen how the government after constitutional rule should respect the freedom and rights that the people should enjoy. Although the government is currently suppressing the rebellion, and the Constitution has not yet been fully implemented, this Chapter II should undoubtedly be implemented seriously first. Recently, military and police agencies in various places often arrest people and search residences casually based on irresponsible confidential reports, and those who make false accusations are not punished in reverse, or even make anonymous or fabricated false accusations. These officials only know how to infringe on the people's freedom, but do not realize that their actions violate the Constitution. Sometimes, the government rashly stipulates a method without considering that the implementation of these methods will cause innocent people to lose their property rights, work rights, or even their right to survival, such as forcibly confiscating (exchanging at low prices, which is equivalent to confiscation) the silver in the people's homes, confiscating the gold carried by the people, and prohibiting cotton merchants from purchasing cotton in the name of unified purchase, strictly speaking, are all violations of the Constitution! Article 152 of the Constitution clearly stipulates: "The state shall provide appropriate job opportunities for people with the ability to work." We really do not understand what crime the cotton merchants, who could barely have a job during the rebellion, have committed, that they should be forced to lose their job? The country has entered constitutional government, and we wish the officials to thoroughly change their outdated concepts in the past, and not to think that the common people can be arbitrarily manipulated and bullied. They should know that after this, every word and action must respect the freedom and rights that the people should enjoy according to law. Only such officials are qualified to handle public affairs in a constitutional government.</p>
<p>Finally, democratic politics is the politics of discussion, and all policies and laws must be determined by the discussion of the parliament. Therefore, whether the promotion of constitutional government in China can be smooth depends on how the future National Assembly and Legislative Yuan conduct their work. It must be known that parliamentary politics values the use of political parties and the maintenance of order. With political parties, speeches can be coherent, and with order, discussions can have decisions. Then, all kinds of bills, large and small, can be resolved under legal and reasonable debates, and the government's policies can be based on this. Otherwise, the National Assembly of two or three thousand people and the Legislative Yuan of six or seven hundred people, if everyone misunderstands democracy, only knows how to show off their heads with speeches, talking at the same time, and making endless noise, and once the debate is deadlocked and each other does not accept it, it may be like the parliament of the early Republic of China, throwing boxes and using violence, shamelessly, what can we expect? Therefore, to ask for the smooth implementation of constitutional rule, we must pray that the National Assembly representatives and the Legislative Yuan members keep two things in mind: Those with party affiliation must abide by the party's discipline and obey the party's policies. Once a political party has made a decision on a bill, the members of the political party should be consistent and have a designated spokesperson to express their views. It is absolutely impossible for each to act independently and go to the podium to make lengthy and eloquent speeches, wasting the time of the meeting. All kinds of meetings must strictly abide by the rules of procedure, and the implementation of the rules of procedure and the maintenance of order in the parliament must be clearly stipulated in the articles, and ushers must be appointed to assist the chairman in handling them seriously. All national representatives or legislators must form the habit of respecting the status and authority of the ushers, so that the meeting can proceed in an orderly manner. This is the case in the parliamentary proceedings of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. These minimum conditions of the parliamentary system must be met first, so that democratic constitutional government can grow strong in the cradle.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Chairman’s New Year's Day Broadcast Address Continued from Page 1 This Year's Bandit Suppression Emphasizes Politics over Military, Economic Crisis and Human Resources Can Ultimately Be Saved <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Our bandit suppression work for this year, in order to fundamentally eliminate the bandit scourge, must still emphasize politics over military affairs. In military terms, we must first eliminate the tangible strength of the bandit army in order to eradicate the scattered bandits spreading throughout the country. We should not expect too rapid results from bandit suppression at this time, nor should we make overly optimistic estimates, but eliminating the tangible strength of the bandit army can ultimately be completed within a year. As for the scattered bandits throughout the country, it will take an additional year or two after the tangible bandit forces are eliminated to thoroughly eradicate them. In order to achieve the goal of eliminating the tangible strength of the bandit army, we must ensure that the National Army has sufficient clothing, food, weapons, and soldiers. This truly relies on the unity of mind and virtue between the people of the whole country and the government, each fulfilling their responsibilities, continuing the spirit of the eight-year War of Resistance, contributing money if they have money, contributing strength if they have strength, everyone taking the public suppression of the rebellion as their own responsibility, with national construction as the goal. In particular, in response to the comprehensive disruption by the Communists, which has created the poisonous scheme of poverty, destitution, and suffocation of the people's livelihood, we must eliminate their hidden bandit spies everywhere and thoroughly clear out their so-called "underground organizations." This is the only key point to prevent bandits and stop chaos, clarify the origin, and purify the source. It is especially necessary for social figures in all localities to act promptly, rise up together, and jointly take responsibility for organizing the people's armed forces, strengthening local teams, everyone defending themselves, and setting up defenses everywhere, so that the remaining bandits who intend to roam have no opportunity to take advantage of, dare not go deep, and that the scattered bandits lurking in wait cannot stand, cannot survive. In this way, the entire country is united, the entire population is mobilized, military, political, social, economic, educational, and cultural aspects are coordinated with each other, the military and the people cooperate, the communities are united, and they fight to the death to protect the country and their hometowns. Then, based on historical precedents, no matter how stubborn the roving bandits are, they cannot but be completely annihilated before the great power of the people. Just look at the self-defense forces in a corner of Wanxi, Henan, which have already inflicted unprecedented punishment on Chen Geng's bandit forces, almost completely annihilating them. All my patriotic compatriots can be inspired and rise up.</p>
<p>The above has explained the military situation of bandit suppression and the requirements for bandit suppression. Next, I would like to explain to my compatriots the main reasons for the current social and economic crisis, as well as the principles that the country should take to stabilize the economy and the understanding and efforts that the people should have to stabilize the economy. Everyone should already understand that the increasingly deepening economic crisis is deliberately created by the Communist bandits. If our compatriots are complacent and selfish, unaware of the need for vigilance, but instead fuel the flames and deepen the crisis, this is exactly what the evil Communist bandits welcome and applaud. After eight years of long-term resistance, the country's foundation has already been depleted, and production has been devastated. Immediately after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist bandits revealed their ambition to rebel. In the past two years or more, they have obstructed restoration everywhere, hindered reception, destroyed transportation everywhere, destroyed industry and mining, destroyed social order, destroyed the dying countryside, and even mixed into the commercial market, using commercial scum to spread rumors, promote speculation, promote hoarding, and even smuggle and evade taxes, disrupting finance, in order to deepen economic imbalances and destroy the foundation of the entire economy. Our compatriots are completely unaware of this treacherous plot, and what they think, say, and do, intentionally or unintentionally, has made them accomplices of the Communist bandits, not hesitating to plunge the country into an increasingly deep economic crisis. This phenomenon is really caused by the abnormal psychology of selfishness and harming others in the cities, which is different in path but the same in result as the Communist bandits' deliberate destruction of the economy, harming the country, and suffocating the people's livelihood. I will just cite one example to make it clear. The number of currency issues in our country today is far less than the multiple of general prices compared to before the war, at least it can be said that the multiple of the former is only a quarter of the latter. However, if this more than threefold price increase is not deliberately raised by the commercial market due to speculation, competition, and hoarding, why would there be such an unreasonable phenomenon of chaotic prices? Compatriots, I dare to say that our economic crisis is not beyond the ability of manpower to save. It is undoubtedly because the industrial and commercial circles do not have a clear understanding of the Communist bandits' scourge, the national crisis, and the relationship between individual interests and livelihoods, so they cannot sincerely support the national economic policy, or even outwardly comply but inwardly oppose, only seeking profit and not knowing that "when the skin is gone, where will the hair attach itself?" This behavior not only harms the country but is also tantamount to suicide. I want to keenly awaken the industrial and commercial circles in major cities across the country to have a minimum level of vigilance, to know that at this time, to save the country and save oneself, the only way is to sincerely assist the government and work hard to stabilize the economy, and not to be short-sighted, selfish, and greedy for exorbitant profits, and take a path that is contrary to the country's stability and the people's interests. My urban compatriots must immediately correct unreasonable lifestyle phenomena, reject abnormal psychological states, be diligent and thrifty, be public-minded and forgetful of self, and increase production and stabilize the economy for bandit suppression and rebellion suppression, unification, and national construction, and inspire their respective consciences, mobilize their respective abilities and wealth. The country's future economic policies and economic measures must adapt to the requirements of suppressing rebellion and building the country, must adapt to the requirements of the interests of the majority of people, and must adapt to the requirements of the country's long-term self-reliance, and must never cater to the requirements of a few people's complacency and enjoyment, speculation, and exorbitant profits. Anyone who, out of the selfish desire for speculation and exorbitant profits, uses excuses to undermine the country's mobilization orders and economic policies, the law will certainly impose due punishment, and society will certainly impose strong sanctions. I believe that the current economic phenomenon, as long as everyone rectifies their lives, clarifies their concepts, eliminates waste, vigorously practices thrift, takes into account the overall situation, considers the future, and works together unanimously to stabilize finance and increase production, then with the breadth of our country's land, the abundance of its products, the size of its population, and the thickness of its economic foundation, there is no fear that the current crisis cannot be eliminated, and the construction of the people's livelihood will surely be promoted, and the Communist bandits' conspiracy to destroy our country's economy, cut off the people's livelihood, and create their own destruction will also be shattered and will have no way to implement their plans.</p>
<p>Compatriots throughout the country, at this time of the beginning of the year, we should deeply reflect on the seriousness of the country's worries and shame, should recognize the Communist bandits' viciousness in harming the country and the people, should realize the urgency of saving the national crisis, should grieve the suffering of our compatriots in the bandit areas who are in deep water, should be concerned about the miserable plight of the displaced compatriots who are poor and have nowhere to return, should be grateful for the hard work of the bandit suppression soldiers who sacrifice and fight for the country and the people, should thank the diligence of the vast majority of our farmers and workers who are engaged in production, and especially should understand the lessons of self-reliance and seeking more blessings for ourselves, for the survival of ourselves, for the happiness of our future generations, for maintaining the results of the victory of the War of Resistance, for consolidating the foundation of national rejuvenation and national unification, for promoting the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, and for seeking a life of peace and prosperity for all our compatriots, we must raise a deep sense of responsibility, develop a strong love of compatriots, work together with one heart and one mind, help each other, with the determination to live today as if we died yesterday, implement the general mobilization for bandit suppression and national construction, support the national policy of suppressing rebellion, strengthen self-defense forces, consolidate social order, maintain economic security, eliminate the Communist bandits who harm the country, and remove the obstacles to our unification and rejuvenation. As long as our confidence does not waver, we are persevering, thrifty, diligent, practice what we preach, and forge ahead bravely, we believe that in the near future we will be able to achieve our sacred mission of suppressing rebellion and saving the country, suppressing bandits and saving the people, opening up a bright future for the country, and building our new China of unification, independence, equality, freedom, and the Three Principles of the People. Zhongzheng sincerely wishes all our compatriots a new beginning and to work hard and move forward. (End)</p>
<p>Stalemate in the Battle Between Ping and Bao, Baoding Enters a State of War</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Baoding, 31st] The battle between Ping and Bao is stalemated. There has been no fighting in Xushui for two nights. The main force of the Communist bandits is gathering more than ten li outside Baoding. There were minor contacts on the northeast and west sides last night. The National Army stationed in Baoding completed a new mobile deployment overnight. There will be fierce battles more than ten li around Baoding. The police bureau convened representatives from all walks of life in the city this morning to urgently prepare for rescue work and notify citizens to automatically dig hiding holes to prevent stray bullets from falling into the city. All sectors of Baoding have been comforting the troops in recent days, and the entire city has once again entered a state of war.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 31st] The Third Column of Communist bandits attacking west of Zhuozhou County on the Ping-Bao Line fought fiercely with the National Army for two days and nights. They were finally unable to withstand the attack and collapsed westward. The National Army took advantage of the victory to pursue and occupied Tasha Mountain, Fox Peak, and Shiting. They continued to advance towards Zhangfang, the western pass of the Taihang Mountains. Another bandit force attacking the Daqing River along the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle was blocked by the National Army and failed to cross the river to harass. It has retreated south.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The battle situation on the outskirts of Shenyang has stabilized. The bandits in Shifo Temple, Wanjintai, Masanjia, and other places in the northwest region have been eliminated. The remaining bandits fled to the north bank of the Liaohe River on the 30th. Wanjintai, 35 kilometers northwest of Shenyang, fiercely attacked the main force of the bandit's 3rd and 6th columns from the 25th to the 29th, annihilating more than 2,000 bandits, capturing more than 1,000, and the bandits retreated to the northwest. This battle is of great significance because the bandit's 3rd and 6th columns are the elite of the bandits. After suffering this blow, the siege of Shenyang has been significantly weakened. Many reporters from Shenyang and other places went to Wanjintai on the morning of the 31st to interview.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The National Army's sweeping force encountered a bandit force near Shalingbao, 22 kilometers west of Shenyang, at noon on the 30th, and seized a lot of spoils. The new civilian transportation in Shenyang was opened on the 29th, and the bandits retreated south to Damin Tun.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The military and civilians of Shenyang welcomed the New Year's Day with perseverance and silent endurance, and looked forward to the speedy arrival of spring. There are no bandit traces within 30 li of the periphery. The citizens have firm confidence in the city defense and believe that the bandits attacking Shenyang are like moths flying into the fire. However, on the eve of the New Year, the market is deserted, and grain prices have risen as usual. Citizens avoid giving gifts and advocate thrift. What is different from previous years is that on the streets at the end of the year, new refugees have fled from the surrounding countryside. According to Guo Keti, director of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, the No. 5 generator of the Fushun Power Plant was test-run yesterday and today. If it operates well, 17,000 kilowatts of electricity can be officially added on New Year's Day, and light can arrive with the New Year's Day.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense stated on the 31st that the official side has not yet received formal reports that the Northeast Communist Army has aircraft assisting in combat.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] Victory was reported again in Chahar East. All the main forces of the Communist bandits in the Yire-Chahar Military Region were heavily damaged by the National Army's encirclement and annihilation in Yongning Fort, 30 li east of Yanqing. This unit attempted to attack Nankou with the First Column attacking Yangfang, cut off the Ping-Sui Line, and control the throat of Yire-Chahar. After the National Army took preemptive action to suppress and eliminate them, in addition to the First Column suffering a devastating blow in Yangfang, the bandits in the Battle of Yongning suffered heavy casualties after four days and nights of fierce fighting and completely collapsed at 4 pm yesterday. The National Army continues to pursue, and the results of the battle are being investigated. The attempt to attack Nankou was shattered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 31st] The Ping-Yu section of the Jin-Yu section of the North Line, between Shimen and Anshan, was repaired and connected at 2 pm on the 31st. Traffic will resume between Ping and Yu starting from New Year's Day.</p>

China Aviation's Ping-Sui flights are scheduled to resume within days. Oil was transported from Ping to Sui on the 30th and 31st to prepare for the resumption of flights.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 31st] Chen Cheng, Director of the Northeast Headquarters and concurrently Chairman, issued the "Letter to the Military and Civilians of the Northeast on New Year's Day," stating that the Northeast Communist bandits launched a winter offensive, adopting the method of gap penetration, and attempted to advance into Shenyang, which was expected long ago. At present, the National Army has completed combat preparations, and the dangerous period has passed. Chen pointed out that the Communist bandits are carrying the remnants of the masses in the ice and snow, in a vast area, suffering from cold and hunger, which violates serious errors in the art of war. The National Army is waiting for work in ease, and the timing, geography, and harmony are extremely favorable to us. He also said that victory will come with the new year, and he hopes that all our officers, soldiers, and compatriots will be firm in their will, unite sincerely, work hard, and strive to obtain the final victory and complete the great cause of the revolution.</p>

<p>Guan Zhengyi Was Released on Bail by the Social Democratic Party After Being Arrested</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chengdu, 31st] After Chengdu city councilor Guan Zhengyi was arrested on suspicion of being a member of the China Democratic League, the Sichuan Social Democratic Party proved that Guan was a member of the party. More than 3,000 students from Sichuan University, Huaxi University, and other universities marched on the 30th and went to the provincial government to petition, which lasted all day. In the evening, the masses surrounded the official residence of Chairman Deng. After Deng urgently telegraphed the Chongqing headquarters for instructions, Zhang Linggao, chairman of the Sichuan Social Democratic Party, released Guan on bail at midnight.

The follow-up issues are being discussed by both parties. Sichuan University is still closed today.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Regarding the Convening of a Preliminary Meeting for the Japanese Peace Treaty: We Have Not Yet Received a Reply from the United States; We and New Zealand are Preparing to Sign a New Treaty <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] At today's press conference held by the Government Information Office, Zhou 楹, Deputy Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, answered questions on foreign affairs on behalf of Shi Zhao, Director of the Intelligence Department. He stated: Regarding the preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty, the Chinese government has not yet received a reply from the U.S. government regarding its proposal of November 17th. At the beginning of the Pacific War, about two thousand Chinese miners from Nauru were evacuated to Australia. At that time, there was a shortage of labor in Australia. Our embassy in Australia consulted with the Australian authorities and decided to assign them to work that would contribute to the war effort, mainly in tungsten mining. Later, a portion of them were hired by the U.S. Expeditionary Forces to manufacture small boats. After the war ended, over a thousand had already been repatriated to China. The last group was repatriated last month. The Chinese government welcomes these overseas Chinese workers back to their homeland. Regarding the question of what opinions are held on the so-called "White Australia Policy," I have no comment to offer at this time. China and New Zealand are preparing to sign a new treaty. The number of overseas Chinese in New Zealand and the number of immigrants, both in the past and in the future, will not cause any immigration problems that cannot be resolved amicably between China and New Zealand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] U.S. Under Secretary of State Lovett stated today: Regarding the proposal to convene a Japanese peace conference, there have been no new developments since the British reply to China's proposal for an earlier meeting on the 13th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Secretary-General Wu's New Year's Eve Broadcast: Let Us Advance Towards Democracy Together; Suppressing the Rebellion and Implementing the Constitution are the Two Major Tasks at Hand <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng gave a broadcast speech on New Year's Eve entitled "Let Us Advance Towards Democracy Together." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, comrades:</p>
<p>Tonight, as everyone is gathered around the stove for the New Year's Eve vigil, I would like to say a few words to you all.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the first day of the 37th year of the Republic of China, the year of the establishment of a democratically elected government, which truly has epoch-making significance. We have achieved what we have today through the joint efforts of the Kuomintang and the people of the whole country for more than fifty years, especially the great sacrifices made during the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. We should cherish this epoch-making harvest all the more!</p>
<p>The so-called epoch-making significance lies in the implementation of constitutional government. What is constitutional government? It is democratic politics implemented in accordance with the constitution. What is a constitution? It is the fundamental law by which the people regulate the government and their own rights and obligations. What the government and the people should do, or should not do, is clearly stipulated in the constitution. When a country has a constitution, the government and the people should jointly abide by the law. Non-compliance with the law is a violation of the constitution.</p>
<p>What is democratic politics? It is politics in which the people are the masters. When such politics are carried out, people with different political views form groups and become political parties. The political party that occupies a majority in the parliament and holds an executive position in the government is the ruling party. The minority party with different political views is the opposition party. Whether it is the ruling party or the opposition party, they must tolerate each other and promote each other under a common goal in order for the constitution to be implemented and for constitutional government to progress. The Chinese Communist Party has become a group of armed rebels against the country. They are enemies of democracy and freedom and are clearly not qualified to be called an opposition party in constitutional government. They clearly have no place in party politics.</p>
<p>The interests of the country are above all else, and the interests of the party are more important than those of party members. The pragmatism of the Kuomintang comrades is for the benefit of the country; the actions of other political parties should also be premised on the interests of the country. The Kuomintang comrades must get used to cooperating with friendly parties and must have the magnanimity to tolerate the opposition party in order to establish a model of democratic politics; other political parties must also have the attitude of mutual forbearance for the sake of the country. Only in this way can we complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The Kuomintang, which founded the country, has a very glorious history, and it must especially use party discipline and bring into play the strength of the party in order to guarantee the completion of the construction of the new China.</p>
<p>Precisely because constitutional government cannot be achieved overnight and there are still many difficulties ahead, the Kuomintang's return of power to the people is not a shirking of responsibility. President Chiang said in his Christmas broadcast that "the implementation of the new constitution is only the initial step in completing our final goal of building a new China." From this, it can be seen that the responsibilities of the Kuomintang and the compatriots across the country are equally great in the future, especially for this generation of young people, who bear the mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future, and their responsibilities are even greater. If we want to be able to shoulder this great responsibility, we must first integrate life and politics, that is, each person's lifestyle must be in harmony with the spirit and methods of democratic politics. This means that everyone must be involved in politics, and at the same time everyone must abide by the law, obey the decisions of the majority, and respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>Compatriots, comrades! We must know that the current disaster facing the country is the rebellion of the Communist Party. The people must cooperate with the government to quell the rebellion of the Communist Party in order to permanently consolidate national peace and unity and permanently guarantee democracy and freedom. Suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution are our two major tasks at hand. It is hoped that the compatriots and comrades participating in the elections in various places will further promote their ideology, advocate for the people, and quickly complete the responsibility of building the country.</p>
<p>While working hard on the urgent tasks at hand, do not forget the loneliness and hardship of the revolutionary martyrs and the families of the war veterans, and the displacement of our compatriots in the bandit areas. We should comfort them and provide them with relief.</p>
<p>"To have a firm grasp and to act with purpose" is an old saying. "To have a firm grasp" means not to forget the fruits of the difficult creation, and "to act with purpose" means to advance towards a great future. On this day of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, which has epoch-making significance, I would like to encourage my fellow compatriots and comrades to work hard and wish them a happy new year and a bright and promising future!</p>

<h3 id="e19">Molotov Makes Important Remarks; Hopes for the Reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference; Compromise on the German Question is Not Impossible; Blames the Failure of the London Conference on the United States <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, 31st Broadcast: Moscow News, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today issued a 4,000-word statement to the Soviet press, explaining the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He claimed that the reason why the four powers failed to reach an agreement on the German peace treaty was because the United States was trying to make Germany a bridgehead for American imperialism. The United States' attitude was stubborn, and it insisted on forcing its own opinions on other countries. Bevin and Bidault blindly followed Marshall. They all blamed the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the Soviet Union, but in fact, the reason for the failure of this conference was the arbitrary policy of the American ruling class. We only have the option of unconditionally accepting the United States' approach, otherwise, it will be impossible to reach an agreement. This policy of the United States encountered setbacks before the Soviet Union, and the dictatorial policy was the main reason for the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 31st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov indirectly indicated in a 3,500-word speech on Moscow Radio today that he welcomed the reopening of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and that it was possible to reach an agreement on Germany. Molotov said: "Although there are differences of opinion between countries, if the Yalta and Potsdam agreements can be observed, it is possible to reach a general agreement on the German question." He stated that the Soviet Union was very interested in reopening the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov's speech was in response to inquiries from Soviet reporters about the London Conference, which broke down on December 15th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] Foreign Minister Molotov told Soviet reporters today that the rumors of the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference were untrue. The four powers had made progress in their discussions on procedural issues, but the work of the entire conference was undermined by the U.S. delegation, resulting in all previous efforts being wasted.</p>

<p>[This newspaper report] New York, 31st Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman held a press conference today to express his New Year's greetings to reporters. He believes that seeking universal peace throughout the world within the framework of the United Nations is still very possible in 1948, because the United Nations is the best way to achieve peace. The President added that peace is not only beneficial to the United States but also to any other country. Although the road to peace is currently full of thorns, the United States will not be discouraged by this.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 30th] General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Zone in Germany, has suggested to General Koenig, Commander of the French Zone in Germany, to abolish the border barriers between the U.S. and French zones. The French response is still difficult to predict, but he hopes to find out the French response to a free movement agreement between the two zones like the one between the British and American zones. Up to now, the U.S. has not attempted to establish an agreement or resolution with them. Koenig visited Clay at the U.S. military headquarters in Frankfurt today. Clay described it as a purely social occasion and did not discuss the possibility of merging the three zones. However, the two met for several hours.</p>

<h3 id="e25">The United States Warns the Three Balkan Countries Not to Recognize the Greek Communist Government; May Send Troops to Greece if the Situation Deteriorates <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] New York, 31st Broadcast: Washington News, As the situation in Greece continues to deteriorate, the U.S. State Department and the War Department are very likely to ask Congress to send U.S. combat troops to Greece. Acting Secretary of State Lovett told reporters that future actions will depend on the deterioration of the situation. Senior officials in the War Department expect Congress to make "extremely important decisions" before the end of June, because U.S. economic aid to Greece will come to an end by the end of June. According to the current situation, the Greek government will not be able to eliminate the guerrillas in the country by that time. The last resort for the United States is to send combat troops to Greece.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The United States today issued a note to the Balkan countries controlled by the Soviet Union, telling them that recognizing the Communist "Free Greece" government would violate the United Nations Charter. At the same time, Acting Secretary of State Lovett reiterated the United States' position at a press conference and denounced the Greek Communist guerrillas' claim that they had established a true government in northern Greece. Lovett said that this in itself is not enough to substantially change the current situation, but if other countries recognize this government, it will cause serious repercussions.</p>
<p>Such actions by other countries would be a clear violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter. If one of Greece's northern neighbors recognizes this government, its actions would be a blatant disregard for the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly in October. Lovett's words were a request for the Balkan countries to restore normal diplomatic relations with the reorganized Athens government. Asked what actions would be taken if Greece's northern neighbors recognized the government, he replied that he did not know what actions Greece would take, but expected that it would appeal to the United Nations. Lovett declined to say whether the United States was considering sending troops to Greece to help suppress the Communists, saying that the U.S. government would have to see how the situation develops, and that he could not speculate on what the U.S. would do at this very sensitive time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Reliable sources say: It is expected that the 5,000 British troops currently stationed in Greece will remain there indefinitely.</p>

The guerrillas did not dare to fight and have retreated north. Furthermore, according to Griswold, head of the U.S. aid mission to Greece, the weapons and equipment provided by the United States to Greece are sufficient to suppress the rebellion.</p>

<p>[This newspaper report] London, 31st Broadcast: Bucharest, Romania, The royal family of former Romanian King Michael applied to the government today for 60 passports to leave the newly established "People's Democratic Republic." Michael met with Prime Minister Groza for an hour. Groza did not seem to hinder Michael's hope to leave the country. Michael talked about his romance with Princess Anna of Switzerland. The Romanian Parliament met today to hold the swearing-in ceremony for the newly appointed presidium. Cabinet members were present to witness the swearing-in. The army and civil servants expressed their loyalty to the democratic government.</p>
<p>Groza said that the Romanian King's abdication had been considered for a long time and there was nothing new about it. He also said that Romania would strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups in the country and the friendly relations with all peace-loving countries to prevent the intrusion of imperialist interests. He said, "We do not want war but want peace, and we will develop our own policies by following the path of true democracy." Groza announced that the royal family's property had been transferred to state ownership, but it is understood that Michael will still receive certain allowances and can immediately obtain US$3 million.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bucharest, 31st] The Romanian Parliament convened today to prepare for the drafting of a democratic republican constitution. The first step is to pass a bill to elect a constitutional assembly to draft the new constitution.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Do Not Attach Importance to Romania's Change of Political System</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] U.S. officials believe that the abdication of Romanian King Michael has relatively little political significance. They believe that the main effect of this matter is only to remove a conspicuous figure in the Eastern European sphere of influence. Michael was the last obstacle to Romania's complete absorption into the Soviet satellite system, but in fact, any major decision of the Romanian government no longer needed Michael's signature to take effect, so Michael's abdication was only a nominal abolition. London Foreign Office officials believe that Michael's abdication is the last unavoidable action in the communistization plan of Eastern Europe. It was long expected that Romania would abolish democracy like Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, replacing it with a Supreme Presidium. This is another example of the "unified policy" currently being implemented in the Balkans. Parisian diplomats believe that Michael's abdication is a prelude to the formation of a "Balkan Federation."

<p>[Reuters, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 31st] Wallace, an independent candidate for the next presidential election, yesterday announced here a seven-point plan to revitalize Europe, advocating that all capable countries should provide assistance, and that the funds should be managed by United Nations agencies. The seven-point plan is as follows: A United Nations Reconstruction Fund. The funds should be managed by a specialized agency of the United Nations. The funds should be jointly raised by the United States and other capable United Nations member states in an amount sufficient for a five-year reconstruction plan. Countries that have been most severely invaded by the Axis powers should be given priority in receiving assistance. Assistance should be based on merit and need, and there should be no discrimination based on political and social conditions. Loans or grants should not be attached to political conditions and should fully respect the sovereignty of the recipient countries. All funds should only be used for peaceful purposes and should not be used to purchase military equipment. The Ruhr industrial heartland should be jointly managed by the four powers internationally, so that its resources can be used to revitalize Europe and ensure that Germany no longer threatens world security.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 31st] MacArthur issued a New Year's message today, defending his economic policies toward Japan and arousing the sense of responsibility of the Japanese people. He stated that the blueprint for issuing Japan is nearing completion, and future development depends largely on yourselves. You, the people, should exert your utmost efforts. A peace treaty must be concluded as soon as possible to alleviate Japan's poor economy. If your needs continue to exceed your production capacity, then it is necessary to continue to control your domestic economy to prevent the weak among you from dying. But this control must be temporary in nature, and must eventually be lifted to implement free enterprise. The economic policy of the Allied countries requires breaking down the monopoly system of the few financial cliques in Japan in the past. This system deprives the majority and benefits the minority, and cannot be allowed to exist.</p>

<p>Tojo Continues to be Tried, Testimony is Extremely Cunning; Answers on the Invasion of China are Vague</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] When the war crimes tribunal interrogated Tojo today, several distinguished guests, including Mrs. MacArthur, attended the hearing. Prosecutor Keenan denounced Tojo's defense statement as "insulting to the court," almost tantamount to restating his wartime propaganda to the Japanese people. Keenan asked, "Do you deny that Japan attempted to assist Hitler in maintaining the new order?" Tojo replied, "I do not mean that. The goals at the time were clearly stipulated in the agreement, which is known to the world." Tojo insisted that he was not aware of the contents of the Munich Agreement. Before leaving the court, when asked how many Japanese troops were sent to China and how many lives were killed in China, Tojo replied, "I cannot remember all of them. If you know, I can answer."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] On the afternoon of December 26th last year, at approximately 7:00 PM, the Zhabei Police Precinct transferred a murder case from the Republican New Road Police Station to the precinct. The informant, Zhang Rongji, along with his father-in-law, Wang Qiusheng, reported to the station. According to Zhang's statement, he is 29 years old, from Pudong, and works in fashion. He resides at 359 Zhongzheng North First Road. His legal wife is Wang Xiaomei, and their relationship has generally been good. However, due to financial issues, he travels to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places, rarely staying home. He heard that his wife had engaged in improper conduct, but lacking evidence, he did not take any action. On the afternoon of the 26th, he received a notification from his father and father-in-law that his legal wife had died at her paramour Wang Afu's residence in the morning. He went to the scene of death with his father-in-law and saw several monks chanting scriptures in the deceased's room. He then learned that his wife had actually hanged herself on the 21st, and the coffin was temporarily at the Taizhou Guild Hall. However, considering that his wife had passed away on the 21st, why was he only notified on the 26th? Suspecting foul play, he reported to the bureau for investigation. After receiving the report, Section Chief Shi instructed Officer Wang Shusheng to investigate. Suspect Wang Afu was brought to the bureau. He admitted to having cohabitated with Wang Xiaomei for several years. Disputes due to financial reasons may have occurred, but he denied any involvement in murder. When questioned about the rope and clothing related to the hanging, he claimed that these inauspicious items had already been burned. He further stated that the deceased had been bedridden since the 18th. On the morning of the 21st, when he returned from shopping, he found her hanging. In a panic, he used scissors to cut the rope, but she was beyond resuscitation. He dared not disclose the incident at the time. It was not until 10:00 PM that he informed his second landlord, his cousin Wang Xiaochai, who then entrusted someone to arrange for the coffin and burial on the morning of the 22nd, and transported the body to the Taizhou Guild Hall for temporary storage. He did not report the incident to the police bureau afterward. Subsequently, the statement of Wang Xiaochai, an accomplice, was generally the same. After reviewing the case, Officer Wang concluded that there was significant suspicion and subjected the suspect to relentless interrogation. The suspect then confessed to the truth of the murder. It turned out that the deceased had married the informant Zhang Rongji in their hometown years ago, and they had been living together for seven years. In 1945, due to economic pressure, Wang Xiaomei started working at the Da Sha Factory in Beiqiao. Wang Afu also worked at the factory as an oiler. Over time, they developed a romantic relationship and cohabitated in the factory dormitory. Later, they both came to Shanghai. Due to the difficulty of finding a place to live, they resided in Wang Afu's cousin Wang Xiaochai's three-story building. Soon, Wang Xiaomei found work at the Anda Sha Factory on Hadoong Road. Subsequently, Xiaomei had another affair and often did not return home, which often led to arguments. Recently, Wang Afu wanted to buy a motorcycle and asked Xiaomei for her savings, but Xiaomei refused. On the afternoon of the 18th, at 8:00 PM, Xiaomei returned home from work, and Afu started another argument. On the morning of the 21st, at 10:00 AM, they fought each other. Xiaomei grabbed Wang Afu's private parts, while Afu choked Xiaomei's throat with his left hand. After more than ten minutes, Xiaomei suffocated to death. After the incident, he secretly discussed with his cousin Xiaochai and colluded with Shao Jincai, and Wang Afu, Zhang Shenwu, and Yao Xiaogou obtained a coffin and privately transported the body to the Taizhou Guild Hall for burial. On the 28th, the bureau arrested the above four accomplices, who all confessed to their involvement. On the morning of the 29th, at 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Liang Shun and forensic doctor Wang Sijian were invited to open the coffin at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. It was determined that Wang Xiaomei had been strangled to death before death. At this point, the truth of the case came to light. The Zhabei Police Precinct has transferred all the suspects to the District Attorney's Office for further investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In the fourteen-year-old assassination case of Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World entertainment complex, Gu Zhuxuan, a veteran actor of the Tianchan Stage, was suspected of inciting murder. The High Court concluded its retrial, and the verdict was announced at 10:00 AM yesterday. Gu Zhuxuan was not present. Judge Liu Yugui took the stand and read the verdict: "The original judgment is revoked; defendant Gu Zhuxuan is not guilty." He then sat down and briefly explained the reasons for the judgment: "The occurrence of this case was due to the accusation of the murderer. However, the crime committed by occurred in June of the 22nd year of the Republic, while the accusation was made in the 24th year of the Republic, a lapse of two years, which raises doubts about the motive. Reviewing the case , Zhao Guangfu's testimony is inconsistent, with different locations for the meeting to discuss the murder and different amounts for the reward, initially claiming one hundred yuan, then one thousand yuan. The alleged incitement is difficult to believe. As for the , the examination conducted by the former Second Special District Court is consistent, and there is a certificate. Therefore, it is evident that Zhao's accusation against Gu Zhuxuan for inciting murder stems from failed blackmail. In conclusion, although the defendant Gu Zhuxuan is suspected, the evidence is insufficient, and he is declared not guilty according to law."</p>

<h3 id="e59">Northwest Archaeological Team Plans to Study Prehistoric Culture in Gansu and Qinghai <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News from Lanzhou, 24th] The situation of Mr. Pei Wenzhong, the excavator of "Peking Man", conducting neo-era geological surveys and prehistoric archaeological work in the Taohe and Weihe River basins of Gansu has already been reported in our newspaper. After Pei's twelve boxes of materials obtained in Gansu were transported back by air, they were studied overnight. It was discovered that there are extremely valuable things in this harvest, which has won unanimous attention from archaeologists. Recently, Pei has written articles published in various domestic newspapers, calling on the people of the country to pay attention to archaeological work in the Northwest and not to delay it any longer. In order to realize this archaeological work as soon as possible, the Nanjing General Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Central Geological Survey Institute and the two branch institutes in Peiping and Lanzhou have organized a "Northwest Archaeological Work Team." Yang Zhongjian, a technician from the Nanjing General Institute, will be the team leader, and Pei Wenzhong, a technician from the Peiping Branch Institute, will be the deputy team leader. They are scheduled to lead the team to Gansu in the spring of next year. May to October will be the survey work period, and after November to the 39th year of the Republic will be the research period (during this period, one or two more surveys may be conducted). The various equipment budgets for organizing the team require approximately 780 million yuan. In addition to the three institutions of the Nanjing General Institute, Peiping, and Lanzhou Branch Institutes sharing the cost, donations must also be raised from enthusiastic people in the country. Regarding the team's work plan after arriving in Gansu, the reporter learned that it will be divided into two steps: preliminary survey and excavation:</p>
<h3 id="e60">Preliminary Survey <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>1.  Within Qinghai Province: Starting from Lanzhou to Xining, along the newly built Qingxin Highway, the southern bank of Qinghai Lake, through Dulan and back, then to Guide and return to Lanzhou. The purpose of this survey work is to continue Anderson's work in Machangyuan, Zhujiazhai, and Guide, and to investigate the prehistoric human dwellings and fossil sites around Datong River and Qinghai Lake. It is expected to be completed in one month. 2. Hexi Corridor: Starting from Lanzhou, along the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway through the Hexi Corridor to Dunhuang, and then return to Lanzhou along the same route. The purpose of this survey work is to continue the investigation of Anderson's "Shajing Period" and prehistoric humans in China. It is expected to be completed in one month. 3. Extension Survey Work during Excavation: Part of the personnel will go to Linxia and Lintao to investigate the extension areas of "Qijia" culture and painted pottery culture. The working period is set at 20 days; go to Shuangshipu, Nanzheng, Guangyuan and other places to investigate the relationship between the prehistoric cultures of the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The working period is also set at 20 days.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Engage in excavation <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The excavation work is divided into three areas: 1. Shazhi, Lintao, Linxia Area: This area is an important location for the "Qijia", "Xindian", "Yangshao", "Machang", "Siwa" and other periods and stone-lime dwellings. The excavation work in this area is to study the relationship between the various periods and to obtain complete artifacts and to excavate ancient stone-lime dwellings. The working period is set at 42 days. 2. Area Near Tianshui: The purpose of excavation in this area is to obtain complete objects of the three phases of painted pottery culture in the upper reaches of the Wei River in the area, and to study the interrelationships of the three phases and their relationship with the primitive Chinese culture. The working period is set at 42 days. 3. Lixian and Xihe Area: The main purpose of this area is the same as above. The working period is set at 42 days. 4. Excavation of vertebrate fossils. After the above survey and excavation work is completed, detailed research will be carried out for more than two years. The research results will be published in the Central Geological Survey Institute and Chinese Geological Society publications.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Ideal Area <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Northwest has a vast land and complex terrain. It is the most ideal area for geological and archaeological work. It has long been noticed by the world academic community. According to reporters, the geologists who studied the Northwest in the past were: the German Richthofen in 1866, who came to various places in the Northwest for geological travel. From 1877 to 1880, the Austrian Ludwig Von Loezg accompanied Duke Sichengyi to China to investigate geology, and worked in Longnan and Lanzhou areas. In 1893, the Russian B·A·Obrutchew came to my country's Northwest for geological surveys. In 1921 and 1923, Xie Jiaye and Yuan Fuli successively investigated the geology of northern Gansu and the vicinity of Lanzhou. From 1923 to 1924, the Swede J·G·Anderson investigated the geology of southwestern Gansu. In 1929, Zhao Yazeng and Huang Fanqing investigated the geology of Qinling. In 1934, Hou Defeng and Sun Jianchu investigated the geology of northern Gansu and the Hexi Corridor. In 1935, Yang Zhongjian and Mei Nian investigated the geology near Lanzhou. In 1938, the American J·M·Weller and the Chinese Sun Jianchu and the Englishman F·AS·uton came to Gansumen and Qinghai Minhe to investigate oil fields. After 1941, the researchers of Northwest geology gradually increased. They include the National Gansu Science Education Hall, the Northwest Branch of the Central Geological Survey Institute (now the Lanzhou Branch Institute), and the Exploration Office of the China Petroleum Company's Gansu-Qinghai Branch Company. They regularly conduct planned research. As for the archaeological work in the Northwest, in 1922, Sang Zhihua and Father PereTeihard obtained many stone tools from the Paleolithic Age in northern Shaanxi and the Hetao area.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Cultural Relics <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In 1924, Anderson obtained pottery cultural relics from the Neolithic Age when he conducted geological surveys in the Taohe River Basin and the Hexi Corridor, which were quite rich. From 1944 to 1945, the excavations of Xia Nai, a researcher at the Institute of History and Research of the Academia Sinica, and Huang Wenbi, a researcher at the Peiping Research Institute, in the Hexi and Taohe River Basins were also quite successful. In 1945, Wang Yongxing, a researcher at the National Gansu Science Education Hall, discovered a large number of vertebrate bone fossils in Wudu, which were once mistakenly rumored to be "Wudu Ape-man", but this batch of mammal fossils has a helpful reference value and cannot be ignored. From June to November this year, Pei Wenzhong, a technician at the Peiping Branch of the Central Geological Survey Institute, and Mi Taiheng, a technician at the Lanzhou Branch Institute, conducted prehistoric cultural archeology in the Taohe River, Weihe River, Xihanshui River, and the vicinity of Lanzhou, which was the guidance for this expanded organization "Northwest Archaeological Work Team" to conduct systematic surveys and excavations.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Team Member Issues <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Although the list of team members of this work team has not yet been announced, it must include domestic experts in prehistoric archeology, paleontology, fossil anthropology, anatomy, geology, soil science, history, etc. As for the core of the Neogene Research Office of the Central Geological Survey Institute, there may also be foreign scholars and experts to participate in joint work. In a recent speech, Mr. Pei Wenzhong said that the archaeological work in Gansu this year has not solved any problems, but has raised many problems. We welcome the scholars and experts of the "Northwest Archaeological Work Team" to come together to solve these problems related to the progress of human culture and to enhance my country's academic status in the world!

<p>New Year's Greetings and Spring Awakening Bai Yong</p>
<p>"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" This famous line by the British poet has now almost become a cliché. But at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, we cannot be without this hope and premonition. This year's winter cold is said to be the most severe in seventy years. Chinese meteorologists, whom I don't quite dare to believe, clearly remember that not long ago they published warm news in the newspapers that there would be no winter this year. How long has it been before the Siberian cold current came, with a heavy snow, and frozen bones on the road, causing students from various universities to run around the streets, soliciting warm clothing. Now the New Year has arrived. According to the Chinese way of saying, after New Year's Eve is the new spring, "the handle of the Big Dipper points to Yin," "a new beginning," as if from the first day of the first lunar month, even the willow branches have changed color, and naturally the heart will be lazy. Shelley's famous line, saying it is just right. But it won't work in the Gregorian calendar. The Western calendar is awkward, and December, January, and February are taken as winter. Therefore, although it is New Year's greetings, spring has not yet arrived, and "the second Siberian anti-cyclone is in progress," we feel that "spring" is still far away.</p>
<p>Waiting is the most unbearable thing. Young men and women have probably all experienced it. If there is no hope, then it is okay, but it is annoying to have hope but it is unlikely to be realized. That which is enough to make people feel short of breath and anxious is almost the same as when something comes to a head and becomes a phantom bubble. The ancients once said, "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will a person's life be?" This led to a pessimistic aversion to the world. In the past, the leisure class created a kind of "Nine-Nine Cold Dispelling Chart," for example, "In front of the pavilion, drooping willows cherish the spring breeze" has a total of nine characters, each character has nine strokes, a total of eighty-one strokes, drawn into double hooks, starting from "counting nine," filling in one stroke every day. After "the river opens in the seventh nine, the geese come in the eighth nine," this method of gradually cutting off time is very good, at least it can dispel our loneliness of waiting, and thus reduce much pain. Although that is also often a sign for wealthy friends to eat mutton hot pot and guess poem riddles.</p>
<p>It is better to find some work than to wait idly. The ancients said, "The sun and moon pass away, time does not wait for me," which is a very sad saying and should not be regarded as a common literary cliché. Just imagine how much good time in our lives has been lost in waiting. Assuming that the time is gathered together, it must be an alarming number. It is common to see many foreigners reading and chanting incessantly on traveling boats, while we are impatient, looking around, accomplishing nothing. Nowadays, many female students knit woolen yarn while listening to lectures, using both hands and brains, which is extremely economical and should be promoted, and should not be rejected by the director of discipline as illegal. If I could use the "boring" time every day to do some serious work, I would probably have become an expert long ago, and would not have to write this boring text in the newspaper's rear end.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese methods of killing time while waiting are various kinds of gambling and eating and drinking, and the New Year is the most prominent of these. Someone once used Suzhou people eating melon seeds as a topic to praise the greatness of the Chinese spirit of perseverance, but unfortunately it is only used for shelling melon seeds, and not for studying apples falling to the ground or boiling water rushing tea, which has made Chinese mahjong more mysterious than foreign poker. Even New York clubs regard mahjong as the most interesting pastime, and Chinese students who make a living by teaching mahjong are also doing great work. Let's not talk about that for now. What will happen if we finally wait for it? Will the beautiful spring scenery really bring warmth? Or will we be able to "strive to love the glory of spring" and take action? It is a bit unpredictable. Wang Yuyang's Miscellaneous Poems of Jinling have a few lines that I still remember: "Ten days of rain threads and wind slices, the sunny spring scenery resembles a bleak autumn." This is not necessarily better. Sadness for spring and sorrow seem to be not just a Chinese disease. The whole world does not lack this kind of climate and young masters and beautiful women with many worries and illnesses. As for work, that's even more interesting. There is originally a jingle called "Spring is not a time for reading." If you don't read, then what do you do? "A young woman is in love with spring, a good man entices her." Clearly, it has again come to a moral issue, so it's best not to talk about it.</p>
<p>On Foolishness Xuan Xuan</p>
<p>Dancers have a bold style and can say what ordinary women dare not say publicly, which is called "thirteen points"; seeing someone jump into the river, risking their own life to save the person from drowning, or encountering a robber, daring to resist, and thus being shot by the robber, is called "foolish". The former is just doing too much, with no major crime. The latter is simply a modern gentleman, and a friend who cannot be subdued by force, and is indeed worthy of praise; but both are called "thirteen points", and "foolish".</p>
<p>"Foolishness" is a derogatory term used by the weak to scold people. Seeing someone die without helping, and seeing someone else saving them, they always feel uncomfortable, which is also a slight guilt. In order to explain themselves, they scold the rescuer as "foolish", so they have a legitimate reason for not helping. On the one hand, they laugh at the rescuer as naive, and on the other hand, they feel that they are worldly and will never do such a boring thing.</p>
<p>"Thirteen points" is a derogatory term used by mediocre people to scold people. Drifting with the tide and living in a muddle, they sigh at their inferiority when they occasionally see someone being serious. But these mediocre people have the habit of "fearing poverty when seeing others become rich." Although they sigh at their inferiority, they still want to say that they are good, but there is really nothing good to say, so they can only say that others are doing too much, and only they are just right, so they scold others as "thirteen points." Thus, those who are not afraid of breaking their rice bowls and exposing the corruption of their superiors are "thirteen points." Others muddle through, but they alone are honest and self-respecting, which is also thirteen points. Broadly speaking, all loyal ministers, righteous men, saints, and sages in the world are nothing but "thirteen points."</p>
<p>Whether the occupation of a dancer is proper is another question, but since they are dancers, is it not right to try to give full play to the spirit of a professional dancer in order to attract more customers? Just like a polite barber shop owner serving tea and cigarettes to customers, being attentive in every way, it is the same with professional ethics.</p>
<p>Not good enough themselves, they dislike others for going too far. Others fulfill their duties, but they can't even do the bare minimum, so they become more and more angry and scold others as "thirteen points", and "foolish".</p>
<p>Shaw's Contradictions Mao Yi</p>
<p>"War is one of the most malicious stumbling blocks to the public...I do not agree with using war as an excuse for any such unconscious slaughter and destruction." – Said by Shaw in 1917, when the First European War was in full swing.</p>
<p>"Why should we stop war? Is it an evil? War is a method of killing, and in this world, there are many, many people who should be killed off." – Said by Shaw in 1934, when Hitler's arrogance was at its peak.</p>
<p>"Surplus value, or what you call capital, is the root of all evil."</p>
<p>"Money is the most important things in the world. It stands for health, strength, honor, generosity, and beauty."</p>
<p>"There is no religion in the world that an intelligent person can believe in." – This was said by Shaw in 1906.</p>
<p>"Culture needs a religion, just like the problem of life and death." – This was said by Shaw fifteen years later.</p>
<p>"An educated person is more annoying than an uneducated person."</p>
<p>"The public schools established by the various classes in the United States are one of the most valuable organizations."</p>
<p>New Year's Fun Tong Tuo</p>
<p>When I was young, I liked the New Year because I didn't have to go to school to study and could play at home as much as I wanted. Besides, there was food and drink. In the countryside, which was very far away from the city, there was no new entertainment throughout the year. The only thing was that during the New Year, I could watch monkey shows, wooden puppet shows, and temporary stage shows, which were economical and practical. Compared to today's urban children, who are happy to squeeze in every time they see monkeys running staggeringly in wire cages in a park; who applaud and welcome every time they see a string puppet show in a noble Western-style building...etc., the New Year's entertainment in the countryside in the past was ahead of the times and could shame the lives of today's urban children.</p>
<p>However, as I grew older, the fun of the New Year gradually decreased. First, I felt a headache for the New Year's messages published in the newspapers, which were all the same, talking back and forth, and could not come up with anything other than the "firecrackers bid farewell to the old, peach charms update thousands of households" type of Buddha's palm. Second, many people today are probably still yearning for the old lunar New Year. Therefore, some people say that the Gregorian New Year is the "official" New Year. Whenever something is stained with "official" air, there is very little warmth, leisure, humor, and casual atmosphere. The third reason is because I have become a father, and it seems that I should be more generous with my children's requests, especially during the New Year. For example, they want New Year's cards, want to see the Snow White movie, want to buy a revolving lantern, would you be embarrassed to be stingy and not agree to one of their requests? And there are still problems with your year-end bonus, still talking about how many percent it will be. After the percentage is properly studied, you still have to wait for the lunar New Year to open. May I ask how you can have spare money to meet your children's requests at this time? Based on various reasons, my New Year's fun decreases in inverse proportion to the increase in age.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people want to gamble and drink heavily during the New Year. The more fashionable ones in the city dance all night. They do this to reduce the stimulation of the passage of time caused by the arrival of the New Year – those who are a little neurotic will have the feeling of "increasing in age without accomplishment" – so they try to obtain sensory anesthesia, such as gambling, drinking, dancing – fine wine, women, and calling out dice throws are all ways to temporarily anesthetize you. The so-called "sorrow of the floating world" is rarely encountered in places of extravagance and dissipation. However, when a gambler steps onto the street in the light of dawn, a drunkard dreams back after vomiting and making a mess, and a dancer, with sleeves drooping and rubbing sleepy eyes, jumps into a car, when firecrackers are crackling all around, they will occasionally wake up in their minds, "Oh, it's another year!"</p>
<p>However, I am an optimist. I always want to find hope in hopeless places and find light in dark places. Therefore, I also look for fun in the New Year, which has no fun. After searching, I actually found the fun of the New Year. That is, there are three days off for the New Year, and I don't have to go to the office. I can comfortably let you connect and get up late for three days – in this cold weather, may I ask what is the greatest fun besides sleeping soundly under the covers, not being restricted by office hours, and getting up leisurely when the sun is high? And this greatest fun is what the New Year gives. However, this matter can only be discussed with colleagues who go to the office every day. If the boss class hears it, I am afraid they will laugh at us for being stingy.</p>
<p>Law Wang Baili</p>
<p>Laws (this article includes various decrees) are formulated according to actual circumstances, and the people rely on them as a guideline. However, today's laws are dominated by a precarious era, and they are often divorced from reality, but sometimes they are completely implemented according to the explicit provisions of the law. The public says it is reasonable, and the mother-in-law also says it is reasonable, making the people truly feel the sorrow of the Yuan Dynasty's lyrics, "Between right and wrong, a concubine's affairs are always difficult!" Take the crime of injury as an example: The criminal law originally had a fine of one thousand yuan for the crime of injury. One thousand yuan at the time of drafting the law could buy one hundred piculs of rice. Now, according to the law, the fine can only buy one flatbread. If calculated according to the price of rice, then the one thousand yuan fine should now be changed to one hundred million yuan. However, I have never heard of a court making such a judgment. Although courts have also increased the fine to three or five hundred thousand yuan, it is still too far from the current reality. No wonder there are more and more people who commit the crime of assault, because they don't care about the fine. Is such a "lenient sentence" the same as the ancient meaning of showing shame with a leather whip? However, showing shame with a leather whip is only a matter of etiquette, not the rule of law. The Analects of Confucius says: "The knowledge of ordinary people can see what has already happened, but cannot see what is about to happen. Etiquette prevents what is about to happen, while law governs what has already happened." Therefore, although etiquette and law have different paths but the same goal, they cannot be treated as the same thing, especially under today's circumstances. I think that everything now talks about the cost of living index, so all the amounts in the law should also be calculated according to the cost of living index to be fair. However, the fact is not always the case. For example, if the government finds silver dollars hidden by the people, if they simply confiscate them, then the people will lose all hope. However, the government purchases them at a one-to-one exchange rate. Can you say that the government does not pay attention to the law? Furthermore, when people who have contributed to the country die, the government grants them honor and a special pension of 30,000 legal currency. If you go to collect it, it is not enough for the travel expenses. If you don't go to collect it, you will be betraying the country's grace, which is truly laughable and ridiculous. However, the people's taxes to the government are calculated thousands or hundreds of times more. Recently, there was a case of defamation. The plaintiff demanded that the defendant compensate for a loss of one legal currency, but the defendant "generously" offered to give 1,000 legal currency in court. The plaintiff said that the lawsuit was not for money, but for reputation, so 1,000 yuan was not accepted, and only one yuan was enough. This is based on the law, and no one can say that he is stubborn. However, the defendant "generously opened his wallet" and was willing to increase the compensation for the loss by 999 times. Can you still say that he is not generous? One is "humble and yielding", and the other is "generous". Since lawsuits have been fought, I have never seen such "well-matched" opponents, which can be called unprecedented and unmatched in the future. Mencius said, "It is better to have no books than to believe everything in books," because the facts in books are not very reliable. I think it is better to have no law than to have a law that is divorced from reality. The annotation is: A law that is divorced from reality will only cause righteous people to suffer.</p>
<p>Various Aspects of Sweden Xu Tonghua</p>
<p>The country of Sweden is long and narrow, extending for nine hundred and seventy-eight miles, with no point in the year exceeding three hundred and ten miles in width. Its coastline is roughly similar in length to that of the United States. Within Sweden's territory, 9% is lakes and 15% lies within the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>During the summer months, Swedes often head south to escape the heat, where temperatures typically range between sixty-eight and seventy degrees Fahrenheit, allowing them to bask in the sun's rays.</p>
<p>A foreigner visiting Sweden for the first time is likely to be struck by two things: the high cost of living and the prevalence of beautiful women.</p>
<p>Sweden is a nation that emphasizes etiquette and formality. When introduced to someone, you should bow twice in quick succession. If you attend a banquet, you are expected to shake hands with the host after the meal to offer your thanks formally. Furthermore, should you encounter a friend who has recently entertained you, you must greet them and say "Tack for sist," a Swedish phrase that translates to "Thank you for the last time you welcomed me as a guest; it was very enjoyable."</p>
<p>Swedes have a large capacity for alcohol and often drink from large glasses in one go. At banquets, women generally do not drink, but they may make an exception after being strongly encouraged by the host.</p>

<p>Chapter 6: Such a Fine Night (31)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai waved his hands repeatedly and said, "I'm not worthy." Qi Huan said, "You are worthy of everything except one thing, your marriage is too out of touch with the times. Perhaps my view is incorrect." Zhu Zhai took a sip of wine, nodded and said, "What you say is absolutely correct. This is my life's regret, the most helpless thing!" Qi Huan said, "What you think is the most helpless thing, I think is the easiest thing to solve. You don't have any children, only your wife." Zhu Zhai said, "Yes." Qi Huan said, "Then what's the difficulty!" As she said this, she glanced at Zhu Zhai, picked up her wine glass, drank half a glass of wine herself, put down the glass, and continued to look at Zhu Zhai's face. Zhu Zhai had already raised his wine glass, but then put it down again, nodded and said, "You say it's not difficult, please tell me what good method is there?" Qi Huan shook her head and said, "How can I say this! It's wrong to break up other people's families." Zhu Zhai said, "I understand, you're saying that I can divorce her, right? This matter is very difficult for me." Qi Huan said, "I want to express a point of view. I think the most important thing in life is that the spirit can be comforted. Whether rich or poor, if you can get a like-minded partner and cooperate with them, even if you live a difficult life, the spirit is happy. Life is short, why make yourself suffer!" Zhu Zhai said, "You're right about this point, but I have parents above me. Besides, my wife has not lost her virtue, so what reason do I have to divorce her?" Qi Huan smiled and said, "Hearing you say this, I see that you have a kind and honest heart. The newspapers publish divorce announcements every day. Have these people all lost their virtue and have no parents?" Zhu Zhai was asked by her and couldn't help but laugh. Qi Huan said, "Then you should be fined a cup." Zhu Zhai immediately drank the cup of wine in front of him, put down the glass, and still frowned. Qi Huan said, "Don't take this problem too seriously. It's my fault for mentioning this, making you sad. I'm leaving tomorrow, so let's not talk about this, let's drink a few more cups!" Zhu Zhai said, "Qi Huan, you shouldn't drink so much, your voice is important." Qi Huan shook her head and said, "It doesn't matter, what value is there in maintaining this voice of mine!" Zhu Zhai said, "Why are you suddenly complaining today?" Qi Huan patted her chest with her hand and said, "I have an unspeakable sadness in my heart." As she said this, she drank another cup of wine in front of her! Zhu Zhai said, "I advise you not to drink anymore." Qi Huan said, "It doesn't matter, my brothers and sisters-in-law at home can all drink. You have a cup too. Why are you so depressed tonight? If you drink another cup, I still have something to tell you."</p>
<p>New Year's Reflections Xu Jin</p>
<p>(1) Farmer</p>
<p>Don't say that this year is the "Year of the Rat," city foxes are easy to chase away, but rural shrines are difficult to move; after the village catastrophe, it is desolate, but there are still farmers working hard in the fields.</p>
<p>(2) Worker</p>
<p>The words "labor is sacred" are not a lie, material civilization originates from this; the most important thing is the construction in the New Year, seeking housing in the face of the "hundred buildings" shortage.</p>
<p>(3) Merchant</p>
<p>Rice is as precious as pearls, and cinnamon is used to pass the New Year, with wailing wild geese entering the market; slightly happy that there are no unusual events in the New Year, only rumors that "American goods" will help merchants through difficulties.</p>
<p>Great Sympathy Zhong Ming</p>
<p>When our school launched a campaign to raise warm clothing to help the disaster-stricken compatriots, I joined on the first day. During these few days, I traveled all over the bustling urban area of Shanghai, ran through many theaters and restaurants, and contacted many Shanghainese.</p>
<p>In the course of our generally smooth fundraising efforts, I discovered that the rich are not as stingy and devoid of sympathy as rumored; on the contrary, when I peddled "relief tickets" to them, they all expressed sympathy and generously bought a few. Although two classmates also encountered several "exceptional" figures, mostly because they had "very little left" in their pockets, or "another classmate had already come to solicit donations"; and there were even many people who appeared hesitant and bewildered when donating because they doubted whether the money donated would all benefit the disaster-stricken compatriots.</p>
<p>But it is worth mentioning that, in terms of the overall situation of our work, the efforts and sympathy shown by the poor and several soldiers were indeed even more outstanding. In particular, two people who looked like small workers were even more commendable, as they chased after us after we had passed by and donated all the money in their pockets. Another soldier also said to us, "I have already donated my body to the country, what is so rare about donating a few coins to the poor disaster-stricken compatriots!" I was very moved when I heard this and felt infinite respect for this patriotic and caring soldier.</p>
<p>Through the past two days of fundraising, I feel that there is plenty of sympathy and warmth in the world. "Great sympathy" should be able to make the world beautiful, lovely, prosperous, and happy.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that if the fundraising work of various schools can be properly improved so that the people who donate can deeply trust that none of the money they give is wasted and that none of it fails to reach the disaster-stricken compatriots, then the relief work will surely have a more perfect harvest.</p>
<p>Two New Year's Days Jie Ding</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it's the Gregorian New Year. However, apart from holidays for government agencies and schools, and the end of the year for banks and companies, the general public doesn't really care much about this "New Year." In the countryside, in particular, one cannot see any so-called "New Year's atmosphere." It is really too shameful that the national calendar, which has been promoted for thirty-six years, has only reached a very small scope.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, the Gregorian calendar is much more convenient than the lunar calendar. For example, the Gregorian calendar has a "leap" every three years, and the leap year only has one "leap" day in February, unlike the lunar calendar, which has to have a leap month, and you have to check the almanac to know which month it is in. The Gregorian calendar has more regular months with more or fewer days, and the solar terms are also more regular. Of course, the Gregorian calendar also has unreasonable aspects, such as the difference in the number of days in a month, with too few days in February and one extra day in August, but it is still much better than the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>However, farmers (not only farmers) still use the lunar calendar of their ancestors two thousand years ago, and literary people and scholars also love to call the "old calendar" and "abolished calendar" the "Xia calendar" and "agricultural calendar," adding the year and day of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. Farmers still use their own experience to look at the moon and determine that today is the first day or the middle of the month, and plant and harvest according to the old calendar. I also celebrate my birthday according to the old calendar.</p>
<p>In reality, this is also the case. The Christian Era of Jesus and the Sabbath of Jehovah have nothing to do with hired workers, tenant farmers, small farmers, and small shop owners. Therefore, government agencies and schools can take their holidays as much as they want, and set off firecrackers, go to theaters, and carry lanterns on New Year's Day, but the general public still does their business as usual and goes to their work. On the other hand, when the end of the lunar year comes, they settle accounts, collect debts, urge payment of grain and rent, press for debts, receive lucky money, send off the kitchen god, get rid of the old and welcome the god of wealth, pay New Year's visits, have guests, put on lanterns to welcome the gods, put on operas, celebrate the Lantern Festival, and play with lanterns, making a lot of noise for a month or two. Even civil servants and students cannot help but play along with the "customs."</p>
<p>In the past, in order to promote the national calendar, there were no holidays for the old lunar New Year. Now, even this cannot be done. The "Spring Festival holiday" is also carried out in a grand manner. Is this because they cannot resist the conservatism of the farmers, or because they do not have the perseverance to continue promoting it? As a result, two New Year's Days are still celebrated every year, and two New Year's Days are celebrated every year.</p>
<p>The power of the old calendar is so great.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a bit unimaginable to force the Western Gregorian calendar on Chinese farmers at the beginning. Chinese farmers do not have the blessing of resting one day every seven days, and it is enough to look at the moon to accurately calculate the days. The general masters can rest every day and live in a muddle-headed way, and they do not need the lunar calendar either.</p>
<p>The system is like this, how can other things not be like this? The complete acceptance of the Europeanization of China is another miserable failure here.</p>
<p>If "reform" always encounters such experiences, it is a bit chilling.</p>

<p>New Year's Message Cheng Qian</p>
<p>Time flies easily, and the scenery changes. The thirty-sixth year has passed imperceptibly. The New Year's Day of the Republic of China's thirty-seventh year has arrived suddenly. Recalling the past and hoping for the future is truly something to be happy about and to be vigilant about.</p>
<p>Since the government issued the mobilization order last year to intensify the suppression of the rebellion, the communist bandits, after being defeated, still struggled desperately, spreading to Northeast China, North China, and Central China. The compatriots in the occupied areas were either displaced, brutally massacred, or coerced into becoming bandits. The compatriots in the rear were also under the wartime system due to the national general mobilization, everything for suppressing bandits, everything for the front line, and could not restore the normal life of peacetime, living and working in peace and contentment. Opening the calendar of last year, there are many bloodstains and tear marks. Grieving for our people and caressing our rivers and mountains is truly infinitely heartbreaking and unbearable to look back on. At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone hoped that the world would be peaceful from then on, and that the people would yearn for governance. Who would have known that there would be today's tragic situation? Now, in the new year, everyone naturally has the same feeling, but grieving recollections and chronic expectations cannot engage in construction and enjoy the happiness of strength and health. Therefore, whether this wish can be realized in the newly arrived year depends on whether the people of the whole country can rectify their spirits and work together to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>The general mobilization order was issued earlier. The government originally did not want to burden the people again, and made compromises in the hope of the communist bandits' enlightenment. The result was the opposite. Therefore, it was an unavoidable measure to send out troops and launch a large-scale campaign. The people of the country should also deeply understand that the communist bandits do not want to see the peaceful construction of the country. Therefore, after the victory of the War of Resistance, they launched wars, expanded destruction, created chaos, promoted economic terror, and caused people's hearts to be restless in order to achieve their sinister plan of causing the country to collapse and perish. The government cannot tolerate these inhuman and brutal thugs. Even if it is broad-minded, the communist bandits themselves have no room for compromise. The government and the people of the country can only stop war with force, stop cruelty with benevolence, stop cunning with good faith, stop cowardice with loyalty and courage, stop looting with purity, and stop licentiousness with chastity, in order to escape from death and embark on the open road to national construction. However, most people in the country do not pay attention to rectifying their spirits, thinking that the country's manpower and material resources are abundant, and there is no doubt that the communist bandits will be eliminated. However, they do not know that rectifying their spirits is closely related to suppressing bandits and wars. If the spirit cannot be rectified, the future of suppressing the rebellion will be greatly affected. The unreasonable communist bandits, their behavior is not surprising, but the eight-year War of Resistance caused the society to develop abnormally, and laws and morals inevitably deviated from the norm. The psychology of ordinary people fluctuated. Therefore, in my New Year's message in the 35th year of the Republic of China, I warned the people of the country that they must not be complacent after the victory of the War of Resistance. From the government to the common people, everyone should be diligent and vigilant, reflect together, check the past and present, and fulfill their respective duties in order to eliminate the hidden disasters within. Unexpectedly, the situation in the past two years has indeed not been beyond my expectations, and the things of speculation and profiteering and committing crimes have emerged one after another. Once victory arrives, people's hearts become even more restless, greedy and insatiable, and monopolizing profits and competing for power promote social unrest and order is ruined, giving the communist bandits an opportunity to take advantage of. A glorious era has once again evolved into a tragic era. This situation is certainly caused by the communist bandits' insanity, but how can people with abnormal psychology not have a responsibility? Moreover, under the current situation, a few lawless people are still living in a drunken dream, still not realizing the seriousness of the situation, the sword is already approaching their eyebrows, and they are still indifferent to the suppression of the rebellion, still treating the country as if they do not see it, and are completely unaware of their own safety and the permanent interests, only focusing on how to engage in corruption and pervert the law to feed themselves, how to squeeze the good and enjoy themselves, how to maintain their vested interests, and scheming in every possible way. If one person is like this, most people are like this, forming a group of evil forces in society. People with weak will cannot withstand the suffering of life, and then flock to follow the trend. As for those who are unwilling to degenerate, they are pessimistic and frustrated, bewildered and distressed, so that they cannot distinguish between right and wrong, and righteousness declines. They do not know that this is what the communist bandits hope for, this is helping the communist bandits, this is digging our own graves.</p>
<p>We examine the rampant rebellion in recent years, the reason why it cannot be quickly quelled, and we must admit that the corruption and deterioration of people's hearts in society is an important factor.</p>
<p>Law and morality are the standards of human behavior and the foundation of social evolution. By observing the law and advocating morality, there can be fairness and righteousness in society. With fairness and righteousness, there will never be the emergence of communist bandits who are without fairness and without righteousness. However, for corrupt officials, local bullies, and unscrupulous merchants who manipulate the market, the law can hardly stop their behavior, and morality cannot change their concepts. They do not care about their bodies, minds, lives, or safety, and it is not easy to bring them back to harmony and dignity. However, saving the disaster is only a matter of a change of heart. What is so difficult about that? The secret is in the sixteen characters passed down through the ages (the human mind is perilous, the moral mind is subtle, be precise and single-minded, and sincerely hold the mean.) All laws and morals are based on this. Indeed, all problems in the world contain various factors. Expand it and fill it, that is the myriad of chaotic things. Lead and simplify it, it still returns to the wonderful use of one heart. Starting from one truth to start using it is to leave human desires to unite with the will of heaven. If the human mind always obeys the moral mind, daily life and common sense will naturally not have excessive or insufficient differences. If the moral mind is established, human beings will always live together in a harmonious, beautiful, and equal environment, and there will never be a catastrophic change. Even if there is, it will be easy to quell. The abnormal development of personal selfish desires will naturally not be needed. Now, no one is not terrified of the communist bandits, but the people of the country have not realized the reasons for the formation of the communist bandits and the methods of eliminating them. This is truly a great crisis. The ancients said: "Attacking a city is inferior, attacking the heart is superior, a complete army is inferior, a complete country is superior." This is the wonderful trick for suppressing the rebellion today. However, my intention is to go a step further, overcoming others is inferior, overcoming oneself is superior, completing things is inferior, completing the heart is superior, because attacking the heart and completing the country is a noble strategy and political strategy that develops outward, and overcoming oneself and completing the heart is developing inward, cultivating the new life of the universe. Darwin once said, "Human beings are always more sensitive to the immediate reality, and selfish psychology is brought from nature, so most people cannot be independent." People with mediocre talents or below cannot withstand the oppression and temptation of the environment, so they cannot avoid reversing cause and effect, the moral mind is dominated by the human mind, once the dam collapses, it will overflow horizontally without end, wanting to avoid the slaughter every day, but constantly creating killing opportunities, the denser the killing opportunities, the more difficult it is to avoid them, ending up dying together after drunkenness, the crystallization of the development of personal selfish desires throughout their lives, who knows where they will be at that time? Therefore, I hope that everyone will pull back from the brink of the precipice and turn back as soon as possible, the mind is none other than the self-nature precept, the mind has no ignorance, the self-nature is wise, the mind has no chaos, the self-nature is stable, not afraid of thousands of feet high, as long as you stand firmly on your feet, this is the thorough rectification of the spirit, this is the fundamental plan to save the country, the family, and oneself, and the meaning of life, "Cultivating one's heavenly nobility and the people will follow," enjoying both spiritual and material enjoyment at the same time, wouldn't that be very good? Otherwise, eliminate a part of the communist bandits, and there are still countless communist bandits in their hearts, eliminate a part of the burning, killing, looting, and there are still countless burning, killing, looting in their hearts, and the great cause of suppressing the rebellion will never be fundamentally solved, because everyone cannot exert the power of their whole heart, and relying solely on material resources, the power will be very weak. In the past, the spirit power accounted for 70% of the revolution and the victory over the Japanese invaders, while the material power only accounted for 30%, which is proof that spirit triumphs over matter. The Founding Father said</p>

<p>Celebrating the Founding of the Nation and the Implementation of the Constitution  by Fang Zhi</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the 37th year of the Republic of China. It is the anniversary of the founding of our nation, when our Founding Father led the revolution, overthrew the Manchu Qing imperial system, and established the Republic of China. It is also the beginning of constitutional governance, and all the people of China will henceforth embark on the road to democracy, freedom, happiness, and prosperity, ushering in a new year for the nation's destiny. In these times of comforting the people and saving the nation, when the entire country is mobilized for the suppression of the rebellion, as we face this double celebration, we reflect on the past fifty years of arduous struggle, which have finally led us to the goal of the revolution: returning power to the people and implementing a government by all the people. We are truly joyful and elated, and the whole world celebrates together. However, as we assess the current situation and look to the future, we deeply feel the arduousness of our future responsibilities. How much more should we strive and work hard to complete the unfinished task of our revolution?</p>
<p>Since the Manchu Qing entered the pass, all our compatriots have been subjected to the iron heel of autocratic rule, suffering endless pain and hardship, living an inhuman existence worse than that of cattle and horses for over two hundred years. Our Founding Father, to save the nation and its people, led the revolution with his great wisdom, benevolence, and courage, running around and appealing to the masses. Despite ten failures, his will was not diminished in the slightest. Finally, in the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai year, he overthrew the deeply rooted Manchu Qing imperial system, rescued our compatriots from fire and water, and established the Republic of China, forever leaving this glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, for more than thirty years until today, although the autocratic system of monarchy has been overthrown, warlord separatism and the aggression of powerful neighbors have followed one after another. For more than thirty years, it can be said that not a single day has passed without the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, democracy and anti-democracy. Such as the punitive expedition against Yuan Shikai, the Northern Expedition, the suppression of bandits, and the War of Resistance against Japan, the Founding Father led the way in the front, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek succeeded him from behind, struggling arduously and persevering with fortitude, always striving to fight for the independence, freedom, and equality of the country, and to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People: government of the people, by the people, and for the people. In such a time of domestic worries, foreign troubles, and repeated national disasters, we finally completed the drafting of the Constitution with hardship the year before last, and this year, we are implementing the Constitution amidst banditry. Our government's hard work and spirit in striving for democratic constitutionalism are worthy of our gratitude and admiration. At the same time, today, the goal of our Founding Father's lifelong revolutionary efforts, the dedication and struggle of our party for more than fifty years, and the wishes of the people of the whole country, which they have sought day and night – the implementation of constitutional governance – are now announced to the nation as a reality.</p>
<p>This is an epoch-making advancement and success in China's three thousand years of political history. From now on, we can see the brilliance of democratic constitutionalism, we can truly enjoy the happiness of democratic constitutionalism, our civil rights and obligations are guaranteed, and our nation will henceforth be a vigorous and dynamic entity. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his Christmas broadcast last year, declared to us: "The thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, that is, Christmas of the year 1947 of the birth of Jesus, will be the day when a unified, independent, equal, and free new opportunity for the Republic of China and all its people begins. The characteristic of our new Constitution is that it guarantees to give to our compatriots throughout the country the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, the dignity and freedom of the individual, universally. This new Constitution affirms the various rights of all citizens, and under national unity and freedom, the spirit of a self-governing people is conceived and born." Looking back on the hardships of more than fifty years of revolutionary struggle, and looking forward to the bright future ahead, on this day of celebration, we truly cannot describe the praise, joy, and excitement in our hearts.</p>
<p>However, while we are enthusiastically celebrating the implementation of the Constitution, we should also be more vigilant about the counter-revolutionary, anti-unification, and anti-democratic forces, who have been undermining the law, disrupting order, harming the country, and endangering the people, that the revolution has encountered in the past fifty years. Today, they are rampant in the Northeast and other parts of our territory. In those so-called "liberated areas," our compatriots not only cannot see the brilliance of democratic constitutionalism and receive the warmth of democratic constitutionalism, but also, under the iron heel of the communist bandits, their lives and property can be destroyed at any time. If we do not eliminate the communist bandits for even one day, then not only will the benefits of our constitutional governance not be universally enjoyed by our compatriots across the country, but also the concrete spirit of our government by all the people will have no way to be expressed. In the past few decades, due to the obstruction of the general counter-revolutionary feudal forces, the provisional constitution of the founding of the Republic of China and all the autonomous codes of the past could not be thoroughly implemented. This is the lesson we should learn from the past. At the same time, the communist bandits of today are not only an obstacle to the implementation of the Constitution, but also traitors who betray the country and violate the Constitution. The Constitution is the fundamental code of the nation that all our people have jointly formulated and abide by. Whoever violates the Constitution betrays all the people of the country. Therefore, the communist bandits are even more the public enemy of all our people.</p>
<p>In order to safeguard the Constitution, to ensure the universal and thorough implementation of the Constitution, and to eliminate the traitors of our free and happy nation and country who are harming us, on this day of the implementation of the Constitution, we must, with twelve thousand percent sincerity, that is, twelve thousand percent urgency, demand the intensification of the suppression of the rebellion. All our people, all our compatriots who seek democracy and freedom, should rise up in unison, under the call of the government, mobilize all manpower and resources, strengthen our military, political, economic, and cultural efforts to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion, and even our moral and public sentiment, in order to accelerate the success of our work to suppress the rebellion. That way, the brilliance of our democratic constitutionalism will be able to shine universally throughout the country sooner. Today, as we celebrate the implementation of the Constitution, we approach the bright future with joy. But we should also recognize that drafting a constitution is difficult, and implementing it is even more difficult. We should be vigilant that today's implementation of the Constitution is only the first step in our struggle for democratic constitutionalism. Our road ahead is still full of thorns. We should carry forward the spirit of revolutionary sacrifice and struggle of the past fifty years to remove all obstacles to the implementation of the Constitution and to safeguard the Constitution in order to complete the construction of our new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his Christmas broadcast last year: "I believe that the implementation of the new Constitution is only the first step in achieving our ultimate goal of building a new China." This is what we should deeply be vigilant about, deeply examine, and deeply strive for today, when we are joyfully, excitedly, and enthusiastically celebrating the founding of the nation and the implementation of the Constitution.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Implementation of the Constitution and Suppression of the Rebellion: An Announcement to the Citizens from All Circles in Shanghai Celebrating the 37th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China and the Inauguration of Constitutional Government <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Fellow citizens of the city!</p>
<p>Today is the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, and also the first New Year's Day after the implementation of the Constitution. As we commemorate this auspicious festival while the whole country is mobilized to suppress the rebellion, and at the same time celebrate the implementation of the Constitution, it has a particularly significant meaning.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this constitutional governance, we must deeply understand that nation-building must begin with constitutionalism. The Constitution is the guarantee of the people's rights, and the implementation of constitutional governance can improve people's welfare and maintain social security. We must establish fair public opinion, cultivate a spirit of respecting the law, elect virtuous and capable people, and exercise political power with the implementation of constitutional governance as our goal. We must also thoroughly recognize that the implementation of the Constitution must begin with the suppression of the rebellion. The communist bandits are raising troops to create chaos, acting perversely, opposing the National Assembly the year before last, and opposing the drafting of the Constitution. Seeing the success of the drafting of the Constitution, they do not hesitate to gamble everything and launch a full-scale armed rebellion, destroying unity and obstructing the implementation of the Constitution. Since the government issued the General Mobilization Order for the whole country last year, the military progress in suppressing the bandits in the past six months has been extremely smooth. The communist bandits will surely be defeated, and the suppression of the rebellion will surely succeed. We must sincerely support the government's national policy of implementing constitutional governance, suppressing the rebellion, and building the nation. In short, nation-building must begin with constitutionalism, and constitutionalism must begin with the suppression of the rebellion. This is the basic understanding we should have when celebrating New Year's Day and the implementation of the Constitution today.</p>
<p>With the beginning of constitutional governance, all undertakings are being renewed. How should we, the citizens of Shanghai, work hard?</p>
<p>First, ensure local security: In the past, the communist bandits created labor unrest and student unrest in order to disrupt security and destroy order. Since the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, although they have ostensibly retreated, they are actually still lurking. We must strengthen the training of the people, tighten the Baojia organization, establish self-defense forces, and call on the communist bandits to reform and ensure the stability of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Second, comfort the soldiers who are suppressing the rebellion: The officers and soldiers of the National Army are suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion, constantly fighting battles, and enduring all kinds of hardships. We should warmly and sincerely treat and comfort the troops stationed in our territory, the volunteers recruited in our city, and the wounded and sick soldiers who remain in the hospital, so that the front line and the rear are integrated, and the army and the people are one family.</p>
<p>Third, strictly practice thrift and economize on consumption: The government has long advocated the strict practice of thrift and economizing on consumption, and various measures have been formulated separately. We must continue to work hard to save material resources and financial resources, reduce consumption, and strengthen the power to suppress the rebellion and build the nation.</p>
<p>Fourth, intensify relief efforts for disaster victims: As winter approaches, the weather is extremely cold, and the general poor and destitute disaster victims are lacking clothing and food, crying out in hunger and cold. We should, based on human compassion, actively donate and provide relief to them to save them from the suffering of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, this year is the first year of the implementation of the Constitution. The final victory of the military campaign to suppress the bandits is within sight, and the great future of democratic constitutional governance is shining brightly. We must unify our will, concentrate our strength, unite our spirits, and, under the leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek, eliminate the bandit scourge and build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People: government of the people, by the people, and for the people.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Many Disputes on New Year's Eve; Workers Demand Year-End Bonuses <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, on New Year's Eve, many year-end bonus disputes were submitted to the Year-End Bonus Handling Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. More than 300 workers from the Da Zhonghua Match Factory petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon, claiming that the factory had issued a month's year-end bonus to male workers. When the other two-thirds of female workers also made the same request, the factory stated that the female workers were all piece-rate or temporary workers, so instead of issuing bonuses, they would give each person one yuan and two jiao, which is equivalent to an extra day's wage. The female workers did not accept this. The Social Affairs Bureau temporarily persuaded the workers to return and await mediation.</p>
<p>Workers demand the issuance of year-end bonuses, but the industry is sluggish and unable to pay. Workers at a certain hair salon requested the issuance of year-end bonuses, but the management stated that the year's business was poor. The labor side demanded a month's bonus. Workers at a certain factory requested the issuance of year-end bonuses. Workers at a certain factory stated that the management not only did not issue year-end bonuses, but also owed them a month's wages. Workers at a shoe factory requested the issuance of generous year-end bonuses. The management stated that there was no such precedent. The Leather Shoe Industry Association stated that each store in the industry that did not lose money would issue a month's year-end bonus to its employees, otherwise it would be handled in accordance with the regulations announced by the municipal government. In addition, workers in the camel wool industry also requested the issuance of year-end bonuses.</p>
