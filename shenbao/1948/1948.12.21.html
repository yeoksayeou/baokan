<h3>孫科宣布繼續作點　以迄獲得光勞和平　新閣組成明日開首次會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕孫科決定組閣後，廿日下午六時半在其陵園官邸招待外闕記者，正式宣布新內閣之政策及部份閣員姓名。孫氏係與王寵惠·吳鐵城就其閣員名單再度詳商後，招待外記者，其招待會係於其精緻之書齋內舉行，孫夫人隨侍一旁，孫氏精神尙佳，場以極流利之英語作簡短之報告，並答覆記者之詢問，約歷五分鐘後，卽行離去。孫氏稱：本人受命組閣，與各方面商談結果，現已決定組閣，將來之內閣將包括黨內外之意見，國民黨將本過去之一貫主張，希望黨內外人士共同合作。本內閣為一戰鬥之內閣，將繼續作戰，以迄獲得光榮和平之時為止。全部閣負之名單現已擬就，卽由本人向總統報告，廿一日卽可發表。目前可告諸君者，為副院長為吳鐵城氏，外交部長原邀胡適博士出任，以胡氏一再謙辭，頃決定中吳副院長暫兼。至於然內入閣者有翁文灝·張羣·張治中·陳立夫·均為政委，俾可共商國家大計」。外國記者詢以：「新閣是否將向共產黨投降？」孫氏以堅決之語氣答稱：「投降？絕對不投降！」孫氏又稱：「吾人不擬向共產黨投降。因向共產黨投降後，中國將成為波蘭或捷克第二。」孫氏於答問時透露，與共產黨妥協並非不可能。但渠强調：欲求妥協，必須兩方皆有誠意。暗示共產黨曾屢次拒絕與政府談和·至此，招待會卽行結束。孫氏開始組閣以來，在京·滬接見記者，均以外記者為對象，有人認為，此為孫內閣着重國際關係及外交之表現。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京日日電〕新行政院長孫科氏，廿日晚於其官邸舉行之記者招待會中，發表簡單聲明稱：新閣人選五六日之商議，終於廿日晚完成，比名單，廿日晚將提請總統審核，廿一日卽可正式提出。余原擬盡量邀請國民黨內外各方面人士參加內閣，但引為遺憾者，卽若千人士未能接受邀請，如胡適博士，余原擬請其出任外長而未果，現外長一職，將由擬議中之副院長吳鐵城暫兼。孫氏繼宣布張羣。翁文灝·陳立夫·張治中均已應允參加新內閣。某外籍記者曾詢孫氏，新閣是否仍「繼續其剿共戰事」，孫氏答稱：「政府將繼續與共匪作戰，以獲得勝利之和平」。另一記者繼詢「政府有無向共黨投降之可能」，孫氏聞言，至表驚異，旋卽以嚴正之語氣聲稱，此事絕無可能，波蘭·捷克之覆轍可鑒也。最後，外記者復提出詢問，「然則妥協之可能性又如何」，孫氏當復鄧重表示，政府剿匪具有決心，決不輕言妥協。孫院長於結束招待會後，卽驅車赴總統官邸，遞呈新閣名單。</p>
<h3>新閣名單今發表　吳鐵城暫兼外長　張羣陳立夫張治中等任政委</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕孫科內閣經廿四日之籌組，廿日始告組成。孫氏甘日下午六時半向外國記者正式宣布此事後，卽携其閣員名單晋謁總統，請求核准，定廿一日提出國民黨中政會通過後公布，再定期就職。孫氏組閣曾數經難關，最近三日尤為其成敗關鍵，孫氏堅主成立「巨頭內閣」，然自渠在滬，在京多次邀約各巨頭而均辭謝後，乃漸趨消極，因向總統拜辭組閣大命，總統當予慰留，並囑張羣，吳鐵城等全力協助。十九日晚各巨頭復分別奔走洽商，廿日晨並會同晋謁總統，當而獲致協議。此一難產之孫科內閣，始以國民黨各巨頭應邀入閣，而告組成，孫氏計議邀請參加之巨頭，現幾全部入閣，除吳鐵城任副院長並暫兼外交部長外，張羣陳立夫張治中翁文灝均任政務委員，不兼部長，盡其贊襄之責。其他部會苜長，據悉：財長徐堪仍蟬聯，其他變動者可能為工商部長劉維熾，國防部長俞大維，社會部長鍾天心，僑委會委長陳策，蒙藏委會委長白雲梯，新聞局長沈昌煥，敎部，資委會或不致變勁。內長彭昭賢，司法行政部長謝冠生則表示堅辭，農林部長或仍為靑年黨人士，不予變動。至民·靑兩黨之政委，現尙未悉其是否有所變動。秘書長前已決定為吳尙鷹，而以左恭為副秘書長。茲悉：現已變更可能仍以李惟果蟬聯，一說端本愷有任秘書長可能，新閣名單於廿一日公布後，將於廿二日舉行首次政務會議。</p>
<h3>孫科答外記者問</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿日電〕孫科頃宣布組織「戰時內閣」，此一內閣在「光榮的和平」之條件下，可能與共黨進行和談。孫氏稱：渠之內閣決不向共黨投降，但將與共黨作戰至獲得「光榮的和平」時為止。孫氏於三星期以前卽奉命組閣，於廿日晚方始在記者招待會中正式宣布其內閣組織成立，同時發表驚人之聲明謂國民政府現願與共黨進行和談。詢以「和平解決之條件為何」？孫氏答稱：「此點須待日後商討決定」。孫氏謂，新閣名單將於廿日夜送呈總統批准，並於廿一日公布，但渠透露名單內包括吳鐵城任行政院副院長兼外交部長。孫氏並稱：張羣，陳立夫，張治中，翁文灝等均將為決定政策而不兼領部之閣員。孫氏謂，此次組閣曾連日與總統及其他國民黨髙級領袖不斷會商，經六日之務力，始獲成功。渠續稱：渠曾竭力容納黨內各派之意見，但若干著名人物雖經渠邀請入閣，終遭拒絕，認為憾事。關於此點，渠特別指出，原擬請胡適博士出任外長，胡氏係前中國駐美大使，現任國立北京大學校長，傳已內定將任蔣總統之最髙顧問。</p>
<p>自民閣卅六年一月國共「和談」破裂之後，以行政院長而公開宣稱已準備與共黨談判「光榮和平」，實以此為第一次。</p>
<p>惟孫氏又在記者招待會中解釋稱：新閣並非向共黨立卽投降，而僅願考慮其所謂「光榮的和平」。</p>
<p>然孫氏此項聲明，與南京方面所一向昭示之政策顯已不合，蓋蔣總統於遲至本年十一月初東北失陷時，猶敦促人民在其領導下繼續作戰，一如抗日戰爭時也。</p>
<p>孫氏已得吳鐵城，張羣，張治中，陳立夫等之合作，其所謂「巨頭內閣」遂告組成。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿日電〕孫科已於星期一晚組成新閣，並宣稱「將繼續戰爭，直至獲得光榮的和平為止」。孫氏並不否認與共黨有妥協及和平之可能性。孫氏稱：閣員名單，將於星期一夜間送呈蔣總統，可能於星期二宣布。</p>
<p>孫氏於記者招待會中稱：「予保設吾人決不向共產黨立卽投降」，孫氏稱，此種投降將使中國「成為波蘭或捷克第二」·記者當問：新閣是否將與共黨妥協？孫氏稱：「妥協須雙方合作，新閣並非投降內閣」·按孫氏之秘書前曾表示，孫氏曾告蔣總統稱渠已不能組織一「堅强之內閣」。</p>
<h3>北平平民日報　警告共黨　勿毀文物</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕此間平民日報今發表社評，警告共產黨勿令故都古蹟文物毀於砲火。該文以「保護故都古蹟文物」為題，首稱：「故都古蹟文物，是我們的列祖列宗給我們遺留下一點惟一足以自傲的東西，無論說什麽理由，都必須予以保存愛護，勿令燬於砲火」。繼稱：傅總司令及所屬國軍奉中央命令和人民委託駐斯土，為北平合法的監護人，他只有心痛，外圍據點把兵力集中北平，以達成保護故物文物古蹟的任務，絕沒有為保護故都而再離開的道理。鑒於國軍連日不藉堅周城防而取得作戰的便利，竟不惜犧牲在十里以外相週旋，足見他保護文物古蹟的苦衷，只有共產黨是惟一破壞故都的可能者。該文復指出：北平絕不是必爭之地，北平雖有其政治影響，但在軍事價值上，並無太大意義，假如為爭一個政洽據點而降低了政治影響，不惟不智，亦且得不償失。該文中特別聲明係站在純粹人民立塲，向同是中國人的面前表達一點人民的意見，寫此文的動機，不是想對目前的戰爭有何評議，而是希望不要把千古遺傳的古蹟毀於砲火。</p>
<h3>立院新院長人選　正由當局考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕立法院長孫科，副院長陳立夫均已參加行政院，其立院職務應卽依法提出辭呈，俾便立院進行新院長之選舉，茲悉二孫·陳兩氏之辭呈，迄廿日午夜止尙未送出，立院新院長人選，前傳將由吳鐵城出任，茲以吳氏亦已入閣，此說遂亦成過去。外傳顏惠慶可能膺選，顏氏現在滬濱，聞曾表示年邁，恐無精力擔負院長重任，此項人選正由最高當局考慮中，如提出迅速，則廿一日可望另行召開中常會討論。立院第二次大會結東在卽，廿一日例會後，至月底休會前，尙有三次會期，故新院長之選舉，勢將迅沌進行，以便於會期結束前將下年度國家總預算案如期審議完畢。</p>

<h3>社論　印尼烽火的復燃</h3>
<p>擾攘已久的荷印衝突，又因荷蘭政府堅持先接受條件後恢復談判的主張而趨於惡化，終致無法挽回，荷蘭軍乃於十八日以共最精銳的英美配備部隊，向印尼共和國首都日惹，發動最猛烈的攻擊。據荷軍總司令部發表戰報稱：「荷軍已越過在爪哇蘇門答臘之防綫，在海空兩軍掩護之下，向印尼突擊，結果如次：（一）荷蘭傘兵巳佔領日惹附近之飛機塲；（二）荷蘭陸軍在日惹之西六十英里處向首都推進；（三）荷蘭海軍陸戰隊已在爪哇之中東部登陸；（四）其他部隊則已攻入蘇門答臘區。同時荷蘭政府解釋此項軍事行動稱：「印尼境內的軍事行動，並非旨在對付印尼共和政府以及願與荷蘭合作的印尼人民的戰鬥行動，而是對付使建設性工作成為不可能的恐怖份子的警察行動。」</p>
<p>不諭荷蘭當局說明理由，說得如伺冠冕堂皇，但由我們亞洲人民的眼中看來，印尼烽火的死灰復燃，終是亞洲的不幸。荷蘭在外交談判中抱着那樣的「盛氣凌人」的態度，處處以武力威脅印尼，最後挾其武力的優勢，不惜破壞神聖的停戰協定，對印尼首先發動攻勢，不僅荷蘭對印尼的那種帝國主義的面目暴露無遺，而且在荷印爭議中，誰在努力爭取和平，誰又在製造戰爭，也可使世人一望而知的了。所以我們對於荷蘭當局的迷信武力，輕肇戰禍，使印尼的烽火再起，不能不表示萬分遺憾。</p>
<p>荷印在第二次大戰期間，也是在日軍佔領之下的，雖受日軍嚴厲的管制，但一般人民的反日情緒，並不因受高壓而見低落；迨至一九四五年八月間，日本宣佈無條件投降，印尼人民都以為「自由獨立」的機會巳至，對於民族自決的熱望，可謂達於頂點，故在靑黃不接的過渡期間，各地不免發生紛擾。詎意英國當局鑒於荷蘭駐軍實力的薄弱，便於九月間開入巴達維亞區，維持地方秩序，因此乃激起印尼人民的反感，新仇舊恨，同時迸發，所謂印度尼西亞運動遂一發而不可收拾，到處與英荷駐軍發生衝突。起初，荷蘭當局也頗能識大體，認為印尼運動是世界的潮流，是不可抵抗的，乃於一九四六年二月十日發表一個開明的宣言，允許印尼人民自由抉擇將來的政體。但這一紙空洞的宣言，並未能使印尼立即獲致和平，談談打打，打打談談，直到一九四六年十月才成立停戰協定，賡績進行談判，一九四七年三月又成立協定，規定於一九四九年一月一日成立印尼聯邦國，雖擁有主權，但仍屬於荷蘭王冠之下。所以嚴格言之，印尼問題仍未獲得澈底解決。而為時未久，這個停戰協定竟又成為一張廢紙了·印尼戰事之再起，使東南亞的局勢益趨嚴重。美國為安定亞洲計，乃從中調處，至一九四八年一月，荷印又成立一項協定，勉使雙方相安於一時·不料未及一年，印尼的烽火再度死灰復燃，不論為荷印雙方的利益計，或為亞洲的和平計，都是一種不幸的事件。</p>
<p>現在日惹的砲火運天，印尼人民為自由獨立而奮鬥，決不會中途屈服的，荷蘭挾其武力的優勢，也不會半途而廢的，所以展望印尼的前途，非常黠淡。凡是亞洲各國的人民，自不能束手旁觀，對荷蘭對付印尼的那種作風，實不能容忍。尤其是我們中國，有千萬僑胞要受到戰事的浩刦，更要反對荷蘭那種好戰的政策。我國代表在安全理事會中，曾竭力主張荷印應即恢復談判，但因荷蘭態度的倔强而未能成功，不免感到失望。現在印尼戰事旣巳再起，亞洲各國的人民自然只有一致行動，抗議荷蘭對印尼的行動，並要求荷蘭立即無條件的停戰，務使荷蘭當局明白，在人民世紀的今日，亞洲任何地方決不能再做他國的殖民地。此外，我們還要請求安全理事會，迅速採取行動，以撲滅印尼烽火的復燃。</p>

<h3>外省同胞遷台問題　魏道明答參議員問　糧食夠供應·房荒感抱歉</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿日電〕魏道明今日上午出席台省參議會稱：「目前吾人一方面要加强省防，另一方面要防止奸徒滲入台省。關於前者，中央已在合省就海軍及空軍兩方而都有充份之配備，可以無慮，現在所應愼重防範者，是奸徒滲入及告謠惑衆，祗須人民與政府密切合作，台省治安是絕對有把握的」。今日會中，曾有參議員兩人，認為外省同胞疏散於台者日衆，台胞至表歡迎，但因台島人口過多，此事似宜加以考慮，並對携來巨額資金如何用於正途，如何保持台省之勤儉風氣，及如何解決台省之住屋與食糧問題，表示關心，魏道明答稱：「內地之大多數難民，均係遷往西南各省，僅有少數人來台，彼等中或為海軍及空軍人員，或為久已計劃來台舉辦實業之人士，此對加强台省防務及發展生產事業，皆有迫切需要。至於並無事業而來台省居住者，僅佔極少數，台省食糧絕對够供應，余所顧慮者，厥為房屋缺乏，此乃當前之嚴重問題，由於台省設備不足因而發生房荒，余就此對外省來台人士，頗表歉意」。魏氏又稱：「在此世界風雲緊張之時，吾人隨時有遇到颱風暴雨之可能，必須同舟共濟，須知幸福和患難，皆是共同而不可分的，惟有共同維該安全，方能渡過艱難危險之境遇」。</p>
<h3>自滬駛台搭客逾限　中興輪將被罰鉅款</h3>

<h3>英倫數事</h3>
<p>鋼鐵工業國有案</p>
<p>鋼鐵工業國有案，終於在英國下議院中，經過三天的辯論之後，通過了二讀會。在內閣制的英國，那個政黨在下議院佔有過半數的議席時，所有議案的辯論，只是對於國民的一種政治敎育，而在實質上，並未必能够影響議案之是否通過。這個嶺鐵工業國有案，眼看就要通過三讀會，而完成其在下議院的法定程序。根據現行制度，還要再送上議院，看情形上議院大約是要加以否決的。因此，如果政府堅決要執行這個政策，必須在二年之間，經過下議院三個會期的繼續可決，方能成為法律。不過去年十一月新提出的「國會法」要將二年改為一年，三個會期改為二個，這個新一國會法的本身，也被上議院所否決，而必須根據舊的辦法。如果新國會法根據舊法，而於一九四九年冬間成為法律，則這個鋼鐵工業國有案，也可以於一九五〇年大選以前成為法律。</p>
<p>重要企業之國有，是工黨實行社會主義的基本政策。自一九四五年工黨執政以後，其首先國有者為英格蘭銀行，接着是煤鑛，煤氣，電業，運輸等項，大約以鋼鐵工業國有所遇到的阻力最大。反對國有者，可以提出許多理由，例如國有工業的效率，未必比私有髙，目下鋼鐵工業事實上已接受政府的監督，現在國際局勢緊張，而不宜再在國內有此類法案……等等，不過據我們所看到的，反對論者多半是枝節的理由，如果工黨決心實行社會主義，則對此幾乎可以說是一切工業一之基礎的鋼鐵工業，自然不能不實踐以前國有的諾言。雖則它的眞正實行，可能還要看一九五〇年大選工黨能否勝利。</p>
<p>南愛爾與英國</p>
<p>南愛爾蘭政府終於在其國會提出取消「對外關係法」（ExtenralReletion）的法案，這個對外關係法的取消，事實上是取消英王與南愛爾蘭的關係，而使南愛爾蘭不再是」不列顛國協」的一分子。在事實上，南愛爾蘭早已成為一個獨立國，在上次世界大戰中，它們且保持其中立的地位。是以理論上，只是使南愛爾蘭少了一個名義上的國王。事實上的影響，多少還是有的。第一，南愛爾蘭的人民，以後（在對外關係法取消以後）在英國成了僑民，無論職業等等，此後將和一般外國人相同，而不能享有英國本國人民所享有的自由與便利。這一點，因為南愛爾蘭人民在英國之數目不少，所以多少是一個影響。第二，南愛爾蘭不能再享受「帝國優先」之商務待遇。但是據南愛爾蘭執政者之看法，認為這些一都可以用條約來協議規定。不過無論如何，這必是也在南愛爾蘭政府的重要考慮之列。所以不久以前，南愛爾蘭雖未參加白治領首相會議，但是與各首相還是有所接觸。最近還派代表在巴黎就近與出席聯合國之各自治領人員洽商。根據南愛爾蘭的看法，認為這個對外關係法的取消，不足要减弱與英國及各自治領的關係，而是要加張，只是他們不要這個名義而已。</p>
<p>接着這個問題而來的，其一是可能還有一二自治領也打算不要再有名義上的「王」，其二是南愛爾蘭在取消對外關係法之後，可能又感覺到有南北愛爾蘭合併之必要（目前北愛爾蘭與大不列顧聯合成為聯合王國之一部分），如何以解決這此問題，大約要費些心思。但在目前國際形勢之下，如果說這就是「不列顛國協」之瓦解，未必可信。（本耿十二月六日寄自倫敦）</p>
<h3>英人眼中看中共</h3>
<p>係正統之馬克斯主義者</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十九日電〕英國各方面人士對中共能亞所持意見，極為分歧，英國保守份子，則堅信中共為正統之馬克斯主義者，渠等認為，如我國一旦奉行共產主義，則僅為蘇聯增加一附庸國矣。保守黨議員麥克林，於今日之每日電訊報撰文稱：「如任中國奉行共產主義，則中國將一如外蒙古或羅馬尼亞與波蘭，而淪於蘇聯之統治」。泰晤士報外交記者今日於報端撰文，渠以毛澤東最近在共黨情報局雜誌上所發表之文章，以為其論點根據亦作同樣結論，渠謂：中共絕非變相之馬克斯主義者。</p>

<p>我國桐油，以四川出產最慰，其次是廣西，而廣西又可說得是後起之秀。廣西大量植桐，遠在民二十年的時候，省當局為發展特產，增加輸出，極力提倡植桐，至二十四年，粗計全省油桐而積已有一百二十三萬市畝，出產桐油二十三萬担，僅次於榖米而盧總出口百分之一六·三六，這是廣西桐油增產第一聲·至二十六年，油桐而積已達二百五十六萬餘畝，產出桐油二十八萬九千餘担，占總出口四分之一而躍居首位。自後雖因戰事影響，日見衰落，而始終不失為主要富源。</p>
<p>桐樹生長雖較普遍，然亦需一定環境，性不耐寒，冬溫在零度以上可生長，生長時需多雨，成熟時宜少雨，如多雨則油份不多，六，七，八，九月雨量多而太陽猛烈地區，最適合生長，俗有「六月遇早球小，七月遇旱油少」之句，意卽在此。土質除極高山地外，均適合，垠士與砂質垠土為宜，合有酸性及腐植物更佳，粘性及含石灰太多而帶鹼性士壞，則易得褪色病。廣西地跨溫熱兩帶，氣候溫和，而且雨多，含石灰質之鈣層土往往受雨冲刷為淋餘土，最為適合生長。全省一百縣市中，產桐油者達七十縣以上，可見分佈之廣。產桐中心在中部和東北部灌陽，龍勝，富川，昭平，融縣，田陽，都安，宜山，全縣，賀縣，榴江，三江，雒容，隆山，上林等地，全省平均栽種面積二五三，七二三畝，平均年產量三二八，八一七担，外銷二一一，八八〇担，占百分七十以上。</p>
<p>桐油品質以中部一帶出產者為佳，鬰江流域次之。桐油之出產，向以土法壓榨，故不甚純潔。過去本省曾於梧州桐油出口總處設所，檢騐外銷桐油。本省出產桐油多帶漢黃色，比重（攝氏一五·五度時）最高〇·九四三〇，酸價為入，鹹化價為一九五，折光指數（攝蔣二五度時）為一·五〇〇〇，以華司脫氏試騐結果，七分半鐘凝成固體，割時不黏力</p>
<p>現在桐油增產和品質的提高，都需要急切的努力和改進，省當局的計劃，是自卅六年起，每年增植桐樹一百萬畝，六十萬株，預期於三十九年起遞年增產三十萬担，對良種育成，技術改良，病蟲害防治，均由政府派員督導辦理，榨油法亦擬改用新式機器，並擬利用自己的原料，大規模設廠製造油漆，以資供應省內消贊，同時更推廣外銷，以期造成本省桐油工業的新出路。</p>
<p>省府本年度擇定配有合作貸款貸糧及救濟耕牛之三十四縣市推行植桐造林，計平樂，富川，興安，宜山，武宣，平南，象縣，遷江，鍾山，恭城，蒼梧，靈川，融縣，榴江，臨桂，夾賓，柳江，雒容，百壽，桂林，河池，荔浦，武鳴，永福，修仁，柳城，全縣，上林，義寗，綏淥，資源，蒙山，灌陽，貴縣等，前列二十四縣己辦理完竣，計造林面積共四萬五千六百畝，植樹共一百五十九萬六千六百二十六株，其中油桐五十九萬四千九百九十三株，這數目拿全省荒地來比較，自然還覺得十分渺少，全省荒地面積二〇，七五〇，而積尙不及十分之一，這一點萬不能令人自滿的。</p>
<p>目前，中央對一個占歷年輸出主位的大宗出口物資，極為重視，為刺激產量，推廣輸出，爭取外匯，明令各地收購價格准參照國外價格，减除各項費用，及出口合法利潤為標準，酌予調整，以裕供應，而利外銷，注意避免中間商人剝削，所提價格均以直接有利桐農為原則，同時政府予商人運輸上之便利，繁榮特產，發展對外貿易，這措施顯然很必要。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十日電〕聯合國機構美國某代表今日稱，美國政府感覺荷蘭已對聯合國印尼糾紛調解會「背信」，美國將召回其駐調解會之代表，除非荷軍退至十九日進攻印尼以前之陣地。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕美國國務部官員今日稱，印尼問題業已提交聯合國機構，關於印尼最近發展情形我人不欲加以評論，惟國務部對於印尼局勢正密切關心，雖值星期日亦不停止辦公</p>

<p>〔合衆社海牙廿日電〕荷蘭議會廿日午後將展開為期兩天之印尼局勢辯論，然荷政府之在爪哇及蘇門答臘兩地之軍事行動必可獲致壓倒之擁護。特利士首相將宣讀政府文告而展開辯論，若干共產工會可望於二十日號召罷工，然不致有大規模之勞工抗議。阿姆斯特丹來電稱：荷蘭首都二十日雖有罷工抗議印尼戰事之煽助，然仍安謐如常。阿城人口三分之一為共黨，然旣無罷工，工業及港口活動照常進行。非共產工會十九日呼籲會員不得聽取罷工之言論。</p>

<h3>美衆議員建議　提高總統年俸</h3>

<h3>英閣將改組</h3>
<p>外交國防部長可能辭職</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二十日電〕此間若干報紙今日社論中皆表示艾德禮目相可能在明年初改組其內閣。各報一致同意現任國防部長亞歷山大可能去職，因渠曾批評本黨及反對黨人士，其繼任人選可能為前駐德司令陶格拉斯以及現任糧食部長史特拉契。又稱，貝文亦將因健康不佳，不能久任外長一職，若然，衆信首相將在國務部長麥克尼爾協助之下兼任外長一職。據每日工人報稱，現任蘭開厦公國部長之達爾頓或將脫離新聞。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社亞曼廿二日電〕外約但內閣今日向國王阿勃杜拉提出辭呈，但國王拒絕接受。此次內閣危機，係由巴勒斯坦問題而起，根據外約但憲法，內閣祇向國王負責。</p>
<h3>吉田內閣陷窘境　因盟總新經濟原則　與民自黨政澡枘鑿</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京二十日電〕吉田茂之民主自由黨，今因盟總為穩定日本經濟而作之臨時指令，大為震動。盟總指令對該黨自由經濟之措施大加斥責，吉田之一黨內閣茲已陷入窘境。觀察家稱，極端保守之民主自由黨將被迫改變其經濟政策，否則不能繼續當政，如反對黨皆利用盟總之九點經濟原則以遂行其政治目的。各反對黨今在議會高聲要求吉田辭聯，以便實行盟總之經濟指示。工業界對盟總之九點經濟原則，皆表欣慰，渠等相信此乃美國允於未來數年內，予日本以大量援助之表示。蓋九點經濟原則之宣佈，明示美國有全面援助日本，使其經濟達到自足自給之決心也。工業界預料美國繼續大量援助日本，可加速日本之工業生產</p>
<h3>一片同情印尼聲　尼赫魯指荷為侵略行動　東印尼西爪哇內閣總辭以代抗議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社印度嘉波爾十九日電〕印度總理尼赫魯今日在國大黨會議中稱，，荷蘭之軍事勝利，決不能終止印尼之獨立鬥爭。歐洲國家無權對亞洲實施任何侵略行動，印度脫離之不列顚統治，等於結束一切帝國主義與殖民主義。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴達維亞廿日電〕西爪哇內閣，追隨於東印尼內閣之後，亦於十九日夜提出辭職。據官司方公報稱，內閣各閣員認為印尼最後之情勢發展，係與渠等以前所以接受官職之原則相違反。</p>
<h3>英美坦克及飛機　竟用於進攻印尼</h3>
<p>菲報認為英美不免汗顏</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺二十日電〕菲列賓人民今日對於最近荷蘭政府推翻印尼共和國及攻陷日惹之「警察行動」，深表遺憾，認為係間接協助共黨在東南亞所進行之宣傳計劃，實為不智。美國政府對於殖民地人民自由選擇政府之權利未予承認，亦屬有背大西洋憲章精神不能無咎。據馬尼刺時報今日社論稱，印尼戰火復燃實為表示聯合國工作失敗最悲慘之蹬明。英美之坦克及飛機乃此次進攻中之利器，英美政府如想見進攻之對象，乃係有決心且有能力擊碎共黨威脅之國家，恐不免汗顏。此次行動之最初結果，乃係英美坦克與飛機之勝利，比項武器原為保衛自由而製，不意竟用於進攻。飛機在爪哇與蘇門答臘等地所投下之炸彈不啻為仇恨種子，而七千萬人民及其友人之仇恨影響匪淺，似不能等閒視之也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕今任英國「反帝國主義大會」主席之社會黨耆老勃羅克威，今日致電安理會，請求立卽設法阻止荷軍在印尼之行動，並釋放蘇卡諾博士及其他共和國部長反帝國主義大會包括印度，巴基斯，坦，錫蘭，維明，和比亞蘇且等國之社會黨代表，以及歐洲各國「反帝國主義運動」之代表。</p>
<h3>蘇策劃消耗美國資源　華盛頓謹愼提防　美國輸出管制發現漏洞</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美官方人士十九日稱，美國政策策劃人等對蘇聯欲使美國消耗資源過度而削弱美國之任何企圖，正在小心慎防。當局深信莫斯科在加施或可促成美國資金與其他資源重大損失之壓力，而圖在經濟上削弱美國。彼等稱，蘇聯此種計劃之主要點，在於共產主義將使美國資源枯竭。蘇聯之不願在聯合國內獲致協議，柏林封鎖之堅持，以及努力推行國際共產主義以煽動世界各地之混亂與騷擾，凡此均被認為在支持此一原則</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美參院最高調查委會頃指責美國出口管制有嚴重缺點，要求嚴格執行，以確保外運物資勿流入鐵慕以內。由參議員福開森所領導之該委會提出報告稱，出口計劃之目前管制已較為良好，但仍需許多改良之處。該報“根據長期調查所謂出口假護照黑市之結果，證明稀有物資最後仍能運抵蘇聯及其衛星國境內。</p>
<h3>紐約降大雪　地面積雪深廿吋</h3>

<h3>天女散花　菲島白衣菴奇蹟　姑妄聽之姑妄聽之</h3>
<p>〔聯合社菲律賓里巴城二十日電〕此間白衣尼菴中，昨日發生天雨玫瑰奇蹟，消息傳出，今日數萬信徒均往該庵朝拜。據聞該庵廿一歲女尼德麗西泰報告曾見聖母瑪利顯聖，玫瑰花瓣殆自天而落。冷淸淸之庵門外，今日突然停有汽車數百輛，好奇者爭以一睹天花為快，亦有揣測花瓣自菴頂窗上撒下者。但天主敎徒則虔誠頂禮，因為天雨花奇蹟，法國里西和地方亦曾見之。聖母顯聖事，一九四七年葡萄牙之法蒂瑪城亦有證據。菲天全敎徒正在調查里巴城之奇蹟，以便向羅馬敎廷提出報告。白衣菴門外今日有小阪兜售天花，路人爭購，亦不疑其眞假，菲某官員願出價五十美元購買，謠傳天花能醫奇疾，某小孩患瘋癱症，一嗅花瓣，霍然而愈，健步而出。據衆尼稱，自九月卅日以來已多次落花，菲故總統奎松夫人與最高法院院長莫朗夫婦均曾見之。</p>

<p>待至九時許，遙見一大機帆船，疾駛而來，稱金源利號，奉船主命作義勇之救生，於是羣眾興奮莫名，羣往該帆船與江亞接近處奔跳，一時間數百人得以生矣。然斯時之混亂情况，更甚於前，强者爭先，失足者不知凡幾，老弱被擠入海者亦不計其歡，最後大批旅客，空懸於該帆船之救生索上，為數衆多，索斷而又入海者更不計其數。於此生死關頭，余以舟小人多，不免過重，深恐將遭二次之災，且念一舟去後，必電告他舟來救生，於是靜待救生艇中，再待生機之降臨。</p>
<p>更一時許，復有數舟行經江亞附近，其中另有一大輪，逕駛遠處，亦無絲毫同情與援助。</p>
<p>茂和輪救出　旅客二三百</p>
<p>其後，乃有駛往舟山之茂利一輪，聞聲而來，徘徊數度，似有所躊躇者。時甲板上旅客為數僅二三百，且海水已上漲，浸及甲板大部，遂由某船員遙呼求救，且告以生者約數，茂利輪又以極强之電光數度探照，然後送來小舢板二艘，將船負某接去就商，經以實情相告後，茂利乃允予以小舢板來回救生，往返達數十次，初救婦孺，繼救男子，余亦終於得救。登茂利後，約半小時，遙望海中江亞，僅旗桿及烟囱之一都，尙浮露水面，不禁悚然。茂利所救者為數約二三百人，搭救後，茂利輪又以過重擱淺於沙難，拋錨待他輪援助。午夜後一時許，海津輪駛到，遂以吾等難客用小汽艇接往，始告脫險。當在茂利輪中時，環顧被難羣中，大都衣衫盡沾，泥血不辦，或以同行雖難，或以妻兒盡失，或僅寡婦生還，一時悲痛·慘不成聲·但見面目黝黑，相顧而憐。由海津輪送回第七號招商碼頭，復搭渡輪至第三碼頭，又見千萬家族親友，引頸以待，大都以未見生還而哀號不已，淚如泉湧，實為人間無比慘劇。</p>
<p>船員無公德　僅自顧逃命</p>
<p>生還之餘，追懷江亞慘據，一一猶在目前，請以下列諸點，貢獻於招商局及航業界，以期日後勿遭覆轍也。（一）海輪逾量載客載貨，亟宜避免。（二）海輪上無綫電設備，須有斷電後其他補救之設備，以便總電訊損壞後呼救之用。（三）海輪上海員應有搭救自身及旅客之救生訓練。此次江亞輪慘劇中，大部旅客未得救生圈，以致互相爭奪，救生艇之懸索，亦迄未解下，旅客大聲疾呼，亦竟無人顧問。海員大部僅顧一己逃命，更非公德。（四）登輪之前，宜從事檢查行李，視有無危險品之携帶。（五）輪機各部，於行駛前宜一一審查，確屬無問題後，方可離埠。（六）航運人員道德，宜如何提倡，遇難而不教之自私船只，宜如何懲處。</p>

<h3>耶誕考證</h3>
<p>歲云暮矣，「普天同慶」的聖誕節又快臨了。</p>
<p>聖誕節，無疑的是耶穌基督降生的日子；慶祝聖誕，就是紀念這位人類的救主。但耶穌基督是否在十二月廿五日那一天誕生的呢？始終是歷史上一個謎。</p>
<p>現在流傳關於耶穌誕生的事跡，是根據聖經上的記載的。聖經上說：耶穌的母親馬利亞，是一個未出閣的閨女，因受聖靈的感動而懷孕。她的未婚夫約瑟，知道了這回事，深深地懷疑。正在猶豫的當兒，忽然得了一夢，告訴他的未婚妻所以懷孕的緣故，確是受了聖靈的感動。並且說：這個孩子，是到世上來拯救人民的，解脫他們一切的罪惡，他是世界萬民的救主。約瑟胸中的疑團，因此冰釋，便和馬利亞結了昏。</p>
<p>在耶穌出生的前幾天，忽然有命令下來，要檢查戶口，所有人民，必須回到他們的原籍。約瑟和馬利亞，也從拿塞勒回至伯利恒去報名上册。到了伯利恒，還沒有找到客店，馬利亞要分娩了，就在一處馬房裏，生下了耶穌；馬槽做了耶穌的搖籃。</p>
<p>正是耶穌誕生的一剎那，在伯利恒郊外草原上的牧羊人，看見天空中，照耀着閃閃的光，使他們異常驚駭。那時半空中一隊天兵，擁着一位天使下來，對牧羊人說：「我是來給你們報喜訊的。今天大衛城裏，生下了一位世界上萬民的救主基督。這個嬰兒，用布包着，睡在馬槽裏，你們可以找得到他的。不必害怕。」說完，仍向天空中飛昇而去。在月明星稀的空中，還隱約聽得見頌揚上帝的歌聲。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，牧羊人照着天使所講的話，到伯利恒去，找到了耶穌，又會見了約瑟和馬利亞，天使的話都證實了。這個喜訊，頃刻傳遍了全城；大家都知道救主基督已經降臨。那都是從牧羊人口中傳佈出去的。</p>
<p>在聖經中，雖叙述了基督降生的故事，但沒有載明日期；就是啓示錄，或敎會史，以及別的書上，都找不出這個答案。那末，十二月廿五日是耶誕節，究竟怎樣來的呢？在聖經辭典中，聖誕節一項下載着：「主後三百年，始守此節。西敎會規定在十二月廿五號。東敎會規定在正月六號。然此乃敎會規定之日，並無憑證·而耶穌敎數百年來，亦無人守此節期；漸次進行，始有遵守也。」</p>
<p>在倫理宗敎百科全書中，對於耶穌聖誕的解釋，是：「……四世紀時，敎會乃決定紀念耶穌聖誕，嗣後著為敎會通行之例。福香書上，未曾記載耶穌生於何月何日，而古人則以十二月廿五日為聖誕，不知何所據而云然。或謂猶太敎本於是日有一節期，古人沿用以為耶穌聖誕日耳。</p>
<p>從上面兩節記載中看來，聖誕節是否在十二月廿五日，頗成問題。據說：在五世紀以前，耶穌誕生的日期，有幾種不同的說法。一說是一月六日，另一說是三月廿五日，也有說是十二月廿五日的。有人用希伯來曆法來推算，說是應在四月二十日。也有說是五月二十日，那是用埃及曆法來推算的。</p>
<p>耶穌誕生的日子，有這樣許多的可能，使許多敎徒們茫然不知所從。不過目一千五六百年以來，始終把十二月廿五日作為耶穌誕辰。據說，十二月廿五日，本是羅馬人的沙登節，古代羅馬奉土神為農神。十二月中，農事結束，正是數樂的季節·在十二月廿五日那一天，每年有盛大的慶祝禮。在第四世紀的時候，各地敎會，一天比一天發達，信徒們也驟然增加。許多熱忱的信徒，想找一個適當的方法，來紀念這偉大的救主基督。可是並無歷史可以考證，又無傳統的習俗可以根據，終於供用了羅馬人沙登節的那一天。到了二十世紀，大家已不知道沙登節，但隆重歡樂的耶誕，是不會忘記的。</p>
<p>規定十二月廿五日為耶誕節後，在英國還發生過一段紛爭。英國是基督敎發達的國家，那時淸敎徒和異敎徒分成兩派。歧視得非常利害·淸敎徒說：十二月廿五日耶誕節，是異敎徒規定的，非但不能附和，並且還認為有污辱上帝的罪惡。因此淸敎徒定了一項罰則：凡附和異敎徒的聖誕節，要罰金示衆，或驅逐出境，甚至要處死刑。每年必有很多人，都因這條規則而受罰。到了克林威爾在英倫稱霸的時候，更進一步，對異敎徒所有的節期，一律取消；違者付諸國法重典。</p>
<p>耶穌誕辰，不但日期無法稽考，連出生的年份還有錯誤。耶穌的生年，據厄克斯哥的推算，是羅馬紀元七五三年，就是如今沿用的公歷紀元。但許多學者的研究，認為厄克斯哥的推算，錯了四年，應該在公歷紀元前四年的。但公歷紀元，傳到今年，已是一千九百四十八年了，雖然差了四年，是不容易改正的。</p>
<p>耶穌的生年，旣屬問題，那末誕生在那一天，當然更無法斷定了。</p>
<h3>閒話火鷄</h3>
<p>火鷄，是聖誕節的應時食品。灰色的羽毛，赭色的纓綬，外形是够美麗的。高大的身體，豐滿的肌肉，也表示它有肥嫩鮮美的肉，可以供人們大快朶頣。所以逢着这一年一度的佳节，必需要備這一味最豐美最可口的菜餚。</p>
<p>据说火鷄的故乡是在新大陆。當歐洲的移民初到美國時，那裏並沒有溫暖的氣息，而祗是嚴寒和風雪。種子才種下去，已遮上厚厚地一層白雪。在這凜冽的北國寒冬中，莊稼是稞粒無收，人們紛紛地餓死。幸兒那裏有許多野生的火鷄，可供初來新大陸的移民充饑，才救活了許多人的生命。從此每逢聖誕節，要吃一次火鷄，來紀念祖先們這種苦難的日子。</p>
<p>火鷄的吃法，在西洋食譜中都有記載·最近美國農業部找到了一種新種——培爾雪維白鷄，遂把它做成了美味佳餚，來供給全世界人士的享受。</p>
<p>培爾雪維白鷄，原是火鷄的一種，身上長着不甚淸晰的細毛，婦女們常把它當作一種恩物。它比普通的火鷄早一個月長成。身體大小。雌的重八磅半到九磅，去了毛還有七磅半到八磅；那是說去了毛並沒有减去多少重量。肉質厚而肥嫩，胸部的更美。一餐豐盛的聖誕筵，確少不了這一味美菜。</p>
<p>農業部的食品工廠，把培爾雪維白鷄宰了，淸除了體外的羽毛，和體內的臟腑，封閉在一只塑造的鍋中，加上適量的湯，用蒸氣煮熟。煮熟的鷄，裝籠以後，輸送到歐洲去。它是罐裝家袋中最美的食品，是山姆叔叔送給歐洲人的聖誕節禮，</p>
<p>一個罐子，剛好是一只培爾雪維白鷄；蒸熱之後，放在盆內，旁邊再加上蔬菜，澆上二勺濃濃地湯液，就成一道美菜。假使你是喜歡式樣多的，可以把整只的鷄分成兩半，將半只盛在盆內，仍是聖誕晚具中一道主菜，另外半只，把它切成小塊，用厚的蠟紙包好，放在火上烤着，那是一樣香味並茂的烤鷄</p>
<p>美國家庭中以鈔票裝飾聖誕樹鈔票係援歐之用。</p>
<h3>談聖誕卡</h3>
<p>聖誕節的規定，已經有一千五百年了；但聖誕卡的應用，還只有一百年的歷史。可是在這一百年中，聖誕卡的繪製，印刷，進步得非常地快，已走入了藝術的境地·卡上畫的景物有白皚皚的雪景，有白髮紅衣的聖誕老人不少是出於名家的手筆·它的裝璜，金邊的·燙金的，也有金屬品的，眞是考究萬分。到今天，聖誕卡雖是交際上的一件小禮品其實已成了一張有趣的藝術品了。</p>
<p>有許多畫家，從繪製聖誕卡而成名，像Kate　Greeoaway,Harriett　Bennett,Alice　Havers等都是。Burlington印刷公司，也是靠印製聖誕卡而營業大盛。美國的許多美術團體，每年製成精品聖誕卡，都是極富於藝術價值的美術館·照相館·博物院·手工業的製造商，也製就許多聖誕卡出售，作為他們的副業，雖然他們是以營利為目的，但不失其藝術的意味。</p>
<p>美術展覽會徵集主任霍爾說：「聖誕卡的美化，是為藝術開闢了一塊廣大的新園地，過去的美術作品，都被人珍藏着，祗有少數人有欣賞的機會。現在把美術作品和聖誕卡放在一起，可以供千萬人的欣賞。」的確，聖誕卡的美化，已引起很多人的愛好·現今已出現了聖誕卡的收藏家，他珍藏着形形式式的聖誕卡，洋洋大觀。和書　中的聖誕卡相比，眞是小巫見大巫了</p>

<h3>存兌金銀政策修正後　造幣廠加工鼓鑄　一兩及五錢兩種小條　成色均在九五成以上</h3>
<p>外傳中央造幣廠有停止鎔鑄金條說，至爲不確。頃據該廠廠長韋憲章稱，停鑄之說，純係外面猜測之辭，完全無稽。政府存兌金銀政策業已修正，本廠自本月十三日起，停鑄十兩五兩三兩等三種大額金條，而全數鎔鑄一兩與五錢兩種小金條。現廠方且正擬逐日增加生產，於前日開始並恢復夜工，現每日鎔鑄數量已達一萬條以上。至成色問題，則因現在所用原料，爲以前所兌進者，故成色自難免參差。惟本廠現正力求提高，所鑄成者，成色均在九五成以上。</p>
<h3>貨主喊高價格　麵粉轉趨挺升　雜糧人心堅俏油市平疲</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日市價轉趨上挺，因米價於週六上挺，人心堅昂，貨主喊高價格，老車粉開一百四十元，較假前升六元，兵船粉略挺二元，收市爲一百二十九元，紅峰升八元，建成漲六元，雜牌粉因價格本來較高，故上漲甚微，麩皮挺四五元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>向榮，人心堅俏，黃豆挺升五元，平湖杜豆漲十元，揀青依然呆木，價格平疲，苞米客胃尚濃，挺升十元至十五元。紅糧貨主扳高，微昂五元，芝蔴祗有本街銷路，成交不多，價格堅定，生仁挺二三十元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>平疲，豆油廠方有供，銷祗本街，價疲十元，生榮油廠方不開，出口商吸購，市俏升十元，生油平定，吉桶生油九百三十元，小車蔴油初爲八百元，收市八百四十元，豆餅油帮納吸，挺五元。</p>
<p>生產銳减　出口减少</p>
<p>頃悉：十一月各地麵粉轉口限額，糧部仍擬按過去分配辦法調劑各省市需要，各麵粉廠業已填報十月份生產量，惟麵粉廠因原料關係，產量已見减少，故此次核定限額數量，然亦將隨减云。</p>
<h3>本期麵粉　收購念萬袋</h3>
<p>糧購會仍委農行辦理</p>
<p>糧食緊急購儲會，爲調劑各地麵粉需要，辦理平價配售起見，本期收購麵粉數量，額定二十萬袋，仍委由農行信託部代購。</p>
<p>據悉：農行業已與各麵粉廠簽訂合約，按照各廠產量，由四區公會分別派定分配收購限額，按當時市價計算，自訂約日起，每旬日繳粉一批，分三期繳清。</p>
<h3>食糖漲跌互見</h3>
<p>食糖昨日市况微軟，交易清稀，本街納胃不旺，執戶均因銀錢業結息封關，貨款不能當日抵用，故脫意甚懈，惟因台糖公司三十六次報價核配又將出來，是以人心微軟，散戶頻有吐售，各檔較上週六均見挫跌。</p>
<p>45號車白糖，袋裝與化白，塲上供售較多，納意閒散，喊價步小，各挫一五元。中砂粗砂無甚上落，土糖漳刁青本廠白走勢軟中獨俏，各挺十元至十五元，其餘未見做開。</p>
<h3>滬金管局調查　市塲游資動向</h3>
<p>最近將實施總檢查</p>
<p>當前金管政策，將有若干修正，所修正辦法，財部正着手草擬中，一俟新閣組成後，卽提出討論，完成立法手續。其基本精神，將以銀行法所規定條款爲原則，着重游資之疏導，轉用於生產之途。至滬金管局自畢德林接任後，一切工作，仍照常進行。該局目前之中心工作，係調查游資之動向及行莊存放款之業務情形。聞最近期內將實施全市金融機構之總檢查一次。</p>
<h3>僑資投資國內事業　輸管簡化申請手續</h3>
<p>據輸管會悉：關於僑資投資國內生產事業開辦以來，一般認爲限制太嚴，故申請者並不十分擁躍。輸管會有鑒及此，除將原申請之手續簡化外，關於輸入物資種類，已建議行政院將原辦法附表所規定之種類，予以放寬，今後輸入物資，並可輸入進出口貿易辦法附表（一）——（二）及——（三）甲所列之物資云。</p>
<h3>輸管簡化機構</h3>
<p>出口貿易管理辦法，自行政院核准公佈以來，已有多日。茲悉輸管會方面頃已正式奉到政院核准明令，該會並決定一俟簡化機構，調整人事之工作完成後，卽可正式付諸實施。在改組完成之前，一切輸出入管理，則仍按照過去辦法辦理。</p>
<h3>輸出貿易重心　漸露南移跡象</h3>
<p>據輸管會息：本週（十二月十三日至十八日外）外匯移轉證迭見上揚，本市輸出數量頗稱踴躍，上週申請結匯總值，竟逾七百萬美元，爲歷來所僅見。惟各地到貨則大部停滯，卽目前正值旺季之猪鬃腸衣羽毛皮毛亦甚少，傳西南物資近多改經廣州出口，輸出貿易重心漸露南移跡象。</p>
<p>至於我各主要外銷品之國外行情，則大抵平穩。據週一接獲倫敦電訊，重慶猪鬃廿七號配鬃每磅二一先令，天津五十五號短鬃每磅五〇先令，天津廿六號短鬃每磅四〇先令，此外羽毛行市挺秀，灰鴨毛與白鵝毛每磅FOB價格，分別爲美金〇·三九元與〇·五九元。</p>
<h3>毛紡業陷危境</h3>
<p>毛紡業曾盛極一時，惟目前情况，有一極大之轉變，該業已陷於困難之境况中。據該業中人談稱，該業之成本過高，其生產成品，照市價出售，當虧至百分之二十。且因交通關係，內運甚爲不易，卽運到亦乏人接手，故銷路甚爲疲滯。該業在此各情形下，極爲焦慮，現狀難於維持，已紛紛减工。該業五六兩季之進口限額，多無法籌措，未能結進。</p>
<h3>呢羢交易零星</h3>
<p>呢羢因種種環境關係，兼拆息低於行莊利率，同時由限價開放迄今，與各種物價比較，其上漲倍數爲最微細，大有再跌而跌不落之槪，至於實地生意，躉批則始終無幾，客路相繼停頓，本街門莊帮除少數外，字號家莫不清寂一時，以致祗有零星交易，絕乏大批買賣。目今一般店號，皆抱售出始行補進之方針，如無銷路均不欲添進。</p>
<h3>絲綢平穩</h3>
<p>人絲市况昨日均爲塲外喊價，塲內封關休市，並無交易，惟人心尚穩，交易亦不多見。</p>
<p>120號天橋隔日頭寸喊一五〇〇〇元，東洋一五二〇〇元，其餘喊價略高二三百元，市况明升暗平。</p>
<p>生絲昨日市况冷落，銀錢業封關，洋行帮未開價，外銷貨未聞交易，內銷貨同業對敲略有零星交易。D級78勻度喊隔日頭寸爲一七三〇〇元，優級零担一六八〇〇元，市况無甚榮辱，上落極微。</p>
<p>綢緞市况昨日亦見沉寂，塲外喊價部份散戶略有脫手，市况較上週六小三五百元，美亞被面喊一〇〇〇〇元，華强喊九八〇〇元。</p>
<p>一般絲廠尚可獲利</p>
<p>據繅絲業公會負責人稱：本年蠶絲事業，雖不及去年，但能審慎經營，尚不致虧蝕，且有微利可圖，如果出以投機方法及賴負債週轉，則當虧蝕無疑。因目下之燃料工資，均仍穩定，滬行開價每擔約爲二萬元，如按淨成本核算，尚有一二千元之利潤云。</p>
<h3>茶會做開交易　棉布初堅後疲</h3>
<p>昨日布市，因銀行年終結息，循例休市一天，惟樂園茶會稍有做開，四君子元嘌嘰最初四九六元成交廿件，繼最高升至四九八元，有小額交易，最後賣氣轉盛，喊低至四八三元。龍頭細布喊四八〇元進，成交更少，布號門銷呆疲，人心帶虛，茶會上則民營布廠所出彩條絨布，稍有交易</p>
<p>中紡停配</p>
<p>昨日封關，各市塲宣告停業，中紡公司因交割困難，亦隨之停止配售一日，今日照常</p>
<h3>日用品平庸</h3>
<p>日用品昨受封關影響，交易極平庸，以捲烟價平，欲振乏力，固本收盤價三百〇三元，剪刀皂二九〇元，一百廿支黃祥茂二百四十五元，美麗火柴稍漲，收盤價一千五百五十元，鳳凰火柴一千五百元，雜牌少做開。</p>
<h3>漢口腸衣業衰落</h3>
<p>希望政府貨款扶植並配免稅鹽</p>
<p>〔漢口通訊〕據漢市某腸衣出口商談稱：目前腸衣出口業務，已瀕於最後絕境，倘政府不設法予以挽救，卽將趨於沒落。漢市較大腸廠如德昌，復興，衝林及三合等，目前無一不减少腸衣出口及縮小營業範圍者。僅就德昌一家而論，戰前每月出口腸衣（包括渝廠）在二百桶（每桶平均六百片，共二千五百副）以上，目前已减至二十桶左右。過去腸衣銷路，以德法爲主，英·比·西·葡等國亦能銷售。二次大戰後，英國禁止腸衣進口，其他各國人民生活困苦，銷量銳减。因國際市塲腸價低落，國內腸廠未敢高價收賣，戰前腸衣每副爲法幣三角左右，目前僅能以每副金圓四元收進，價格約低落三倍。腸衣來源，除漢口本市外，大部仰賴於鄉村，目前各地肉商無利可圖，多將腸衣隨猪肉搭售，加以匪區擴大，腸商販運不便，收購不易，腸廠除運輸廠繳以外，精鹽開支實居重要項目，每桶腸衣需用精鹽兩百斤，漢市各大鹽號礙於種種困難，未能以較低價格大批出售，不得已只能以高價求之於零星市塲，增加製腸成本。在已往各腸廠曾盡最大力量，利用國內不重要物資（腸衣）爲政府爭取大量外匯，對平衡國際收支，不無裨益。而今面臨危機，仍堅守崗位，力圖掙扎，希望政府本鼓勵出口業務宗旨，對各腸廠立卽以扶植。一面實行低利貨款，另一面配售免稅鹽，（上海已有先例）並給予運輸上之便利，藉以挽救垂危命運云。</p>
<h3>七八兩季進口限額　可申請在他埠進口</h3>
<p>據輸管會息：第七八兩季輸入限額，早經分配完畢，至工業限額，則因各製造廠商同業尚未協議分配竣事，業呈輸入限額處照配。據悉：以前經限額分配處核定之輸入限額案件，經簽證室發給進口許可證者，已有兩百餘件，但各申請戶均未前去領取，一反以往之情形，聞係觀望之故。惟據負責當局宣稱：各申請戶如不願在上海進口時，可在簽證室辦理轉口手續，在他埠進口云。</p>
<h3>木材到貨仍稀</h3>
<p>木材市勢，在銀行結息封關期間，交易如常。並爲開關後業外各物或可看高，因之同業交易，不願貶價。杉木條子開一元四角及一元三角，銷路頗好。坦戶板以香烟廠復工之傳甚盛，茶會中亦有吸納，餘貨尚稱穩定。惟到貨仍稀，諒係局勢影響，同業不敢向產地多量採購所致。</p>

<h3>閩省木材　面臨危機　尙有一綫希望</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　陳曉風</p>
<p>〔本報廈門十七日航訊〕福建經濟命脈，在閩南的是靠僑匯的收入，在閩北的是靠特產的輸出，這些特產除了茶葉，水仙花，柑，筍，香菰外，木材是為閩省主要輸出特產，多數均以福州為吐納口，它不僅維持間北廣大地區數十萬木工的生活，同時亦支撑了福州市面的繁榮。</p>
<p>好景不常　可是好景不常，目前大半個中國陷於砲火中，而作為閩省木材最大市塲的天津和上海，因戰亂而停止一切建設，因此福建的木材去路斷絕，外銷情况陷入空前窘境，素稱木材集散地之福州，迄目前止，有一百九十餘家之木材行，均被迫不能動彈，其中完全呈着停滯狀態者亦達九十餘家，此外，一百四十餘家的鋸木廠，亦面臨同一危機而歇業，直接影饗了靠着木廠鋸木的數萬工人生活，這確是目前閩省一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>工人生活</p>
<p>據有經濟眼光的人士談：木材銷售之呆滯，是閩省經濟危機之先兆，蓋閩北一帶年產木材甚多，除專營此業的木客木商外，負責淸山，去皮，鋸筒，拖籬，放溪，釘挑等木工不下有數十萬人，木農尙不計算在內。若一旦木材全部停銷，這數十萬的工人生活將如何解決？農村破產，似難倖免，其影響社會經濟尤甚。這時閩北一帶的治安，卽將發生一個不可預測的局勢，這顯然將形成一個社會經濟問題。</p>
<p>外銷停滯</p>
<p>木材的停滯，是受最近北方戰事的影響，往昔閩產木材之外銷，第一對象為上海，次為天津，分銷牛莊，烟台等地，再次為寗波，南通，台灣及閩南等地，外銷最鉅之處除了一般性需用外，開礦使用尤多，可是今“戰亂影饗了北方採礦工作，减少需用，其他更不必言說，誠予閩產木材重大之打擊。</p>
<p>本省採用福州木材地區，多係沿海一帶之福淸，莆田，泉州等地，過去因閩南僑匯暢通，僑區大興土木，銷路頗佳。近因僑匯不繼，因此亦受影響，但銷售數量畢竟有限，致木材在福州價格已一落千丈。依目前現狀言：木材尙不及薪柴之價格，薪柴每担叫價廿餘元，但木材須以每筒十二圓左右價值，重量約一百廿斤，加工鋸成柴片，始可獲得一倍以上的優價。除了工資，木材本身的價格血本無歸，因此，木客們也不願再營此業，紛紛改行，或悄然北返。福州的市塲亦因此而蕭條了。近日南台歌塲菜館，生意淸淡，與今年八九月間木材飛漲之黃金時代迥異，曾幾何時，相去竟如天淵，不堪回首。</p>
<p>開闢市場</p>
<p>今後木材銷路，合灣便是一個主要推銷市塲，過去台灣因為建築日本式房屋，無需福建這種粗大的木材，所以有「好木不去台」之說。但最近，京滬人口大量移台，台灣正在大興土木，處處需用木材，因此福州木材商日前已有一部份赴台尋求銷路，閩省府為解決目前這種嚴重問題，十二日亦派閩省委陳華洲赴台商洽開闢木材市塲，若能成功，這是福建木材面臨危機中的一綫希望，但據經營此業人士稱：本省木材運銷問題，目前所感困難者，尙是交通工具，若這個難題能獲得解決，福建木材在台尙大有可為，危機當可消弭於無形。</p>

<h3>海南寄語　要塞司令聶琦至父老書</h3>
<p>— 奚文</p>
<p>〔本報江陰十九日訊〕前要塞司令部參謀長聶琦，於本年十月間調任海南島要塞司令，於十一月三日抵達榆林，接任視事，日前曾致函本邑父老將談島各方面現况報導甚詳，茲塲要錄次：　海南島為中國之最南端，位置於北緯十九度九分之二十度七，及東經百八度三十六分至百十一度三分之間，集東北贛維羣島及周圍之水島，而成一橢圓形之島嶼，與東京台灣遙遙相對，南控南洋羣島，東與菲律賓相望，北隔雷瓊海峽，與雷州半島對峙，為西南太平洋之戰略樞紐，全島面積約九萬七千一百九十八方里，與相隔六百海里之台灣矚望，不啻為中華民國之兩隻眼睛，相互守衛着國防海疆，在國防經濟上確佔着最重要之一環。</p>
<p>海口港位於本島之北端，為全島</p>
<p>商業總匯</p>
<p>人文哲萃，不亞內地之都市，明代之丘公文莊海公忠介，均先後誕生於此間，尤足為本島生色。榆林港位於本島之極南端，為國防軍事上最重要之海空軍根據地，亦為控制南太平洋之唯一基地。記得抗戰期間，日敵於淪陷本島之始，蔣總統對中外記者發表談話，特別強調稱其為太平洋上之「九一八」，其地位上之重要可想而知。檢林港又為天然之良好軍港，日俄戰爭時，俄國艦隊曾停泊於此，現港內海軍碼頭，經日人數年苦心營建，水深港闊，可停泊一萬噸以上之戰艦，且周圍山環水抱，形勢雄偉，旣無颶風襲擊之虞，尤擅風景優良之勝，洵良港也。</p>
<p>瓊島不但具有</p>
<p>天然海港及空軍大基地，亦為一塊尙待開發之處女地，島內礦山蘊藏至富，瓊西石碌之鐵礦，與瓊南榆林之田獨礦山，尤為全世界礦質最優者。刻海南鐵礦局，已從事新法開採，每日採礦砂不少，象徵中國工業可喜的遠景。漁業水產之蘊藏，亦為華南最大漁業站，刻漁管處廣東分處，設於榆林，從事發展漁業，瓊南榆亞與瓊西昌感，以及英歌海之鹽田，尤為規模最大。日人原企圖開創為世界第二位籃田，以供給其南太平洋及本國之軍需與民食，惟僅完成工程十分之一二，日寇卽告無條件投降。今後層峯果能急起直追，一面以軍事力量掃蕩散匪，一面從事建設工作，則國利民福，前途正未可限量也。　此外并有椰子，璸瑯，波羅蜜等</p>
<p>熱帶產物</p>
<p>為我國內地所無，比亦為我國唯一橡膠產地，故在國防資源上實不失為一重要實庫。過去日人苦心營造，各項開發建設稍具基礎，惜復員以後，匪惠蔓延，開發工作無由展開，然政府仍念念不忘於瓊島建設者，職是之故也。　瓊島氣候屬於亞　帶，雖近赤道，因有太平洋海風之調劑，故并朱十分酷熱，種植物宜於生長，有「四時皆是夏，一雨便成秋」之譽。島民生活敦厚純樸，有刻苦耐勞之習慣，尤富浩然之正義感，腹地黎人，散居深山荒野，尙過着原始生活，此固有待當局積極進行敎化工作。目前島南榆亞一帶，治安尙稱良好。惟以</p>
<p>防區遼闊</p>
<p>兵力單薄，匪　徒仍不時滋擾，而本人當一本革命精神，軍人保國衛民之職責，秉層峯指示，確保治安，鞏固瓊南，把握時機，淸剿匪患，以紓政府南顧之憂，而副人民屬望之殷。</p>
<p>近日漫天烽火，籠罩大地，自調職海南，一去萬里，每閱報章，知淮河之瀕危，感江南之威脅，未嘗不為我</p>
<p>隔江相望</p>
<p>之父老昆仲，感受風雨　搖。古人云：「生於憂患，死於逸樂」，又云：「孤臣孽子，其操心也危，其慮思也深」，是故艱困危疑之秋，正我輩成功立業之大好機會。望我江陰父老，一本過去軍民合作精神，在戴司令領導下，一致奮起，阻敵人於江北，弭匪患於無形，此則本人夙夜期望於我父老昆弟者也。</p>

<h3>給新疆拓荒者　無情的解剖</h3>
<p>— 劉佩衡</p>
<p>〔迪化十六日航訊〕記者初到新疆的時候，對新疆的漢族人這一羣所謂邊疆拓荒者，印象特別深，比初會到有着西洋典型的高鼻子的維族人還要驚奇。有幾種比內地還要腐化幾倍的現象，使我感到痛苦，使我感到悲哀，甚至使我有一種絕望的感覺。在以前投給內地報紙的通訊中，我對新疆漢族同胞的生活情形，也曾間斷的提到一些，不過都提得太少，且雜亂無章，很難給人以深刻的印象，所以現在我特別做一個較有系統的報告，以饗關心邊疆的讀奢。</p>
<p>漢族人數增多</p>
<p>近年來漢族人遷入的日益增多，所以從前的統計數目字都不可靠。據西大敎授陳澄之先生截止三十五年的統計，是二十萬零二千二百三十九人。不過現在恐已接近三十萬大關了。這些漢族人居住的地區，是以迪化為中心，分佈在北疆的奇台，綏來，呼岡壁，鎭西一帶，東疆的哈密也有一小部分。南疆除了幾個大城市有少數外，幾乎看不到漢人的影子。這些漢族同胞，最多的是商人其次是軍政人員，再有一部分是從碟聯回國的華僑。商人中多半是遜淸末年及民國初年移居到新疆來的，有的是從政或戍邊來新而改業的，有的是由天津山東一帶跑到新疆來淘金的商人。他們來到新疆，時間已久，成家立業之後，一方面因交通不便，再一方面新疆是一塊待開發的處女地，各項事業都比內地容易發展，經商更是有利可圖，因此索性落了戶籍，變成准新疆人了。這些漢人的環境，較新疆土著民放要優越得多，且握有左右經濟的勢力，所以他們在新疆常以「優等」民族自居，而變　了新疆的寵兒。不過這些寵兒也曾被敎訓過一次。卅三年伊寗事變，伊·塔·阿三區的漢人曾被殺不少，至和平條款簽訂後，流亡出來的也都破了產。在三十　年事變最危急的時候，迪化及北　一帶的漢人都曾紛紛向內地逃命，直到和平條款簽定後，他們才定住了驚魂，陸續返回新疆。</p>
<p>漢族人經過這番敎訓，按理說對邊疆問題該多一番新的認識，在心理上也應該有一個警惕。其實不然，、尤其是近年來一批批的軍政大員及所謂「邊疆拓荒者」一，絡繹西來，把內地所有的腐化風氣也帶到了新疆。「二漢」合流，凡是內地所有的玩藝，新疆都有了，食污·舞弊·吸毒·走私·吃·喝·嫖·賭·無一樣有遜內地，尤其是在新疆神經中樞的迪化。</p>
<p>不調和的現象</p>
<p>住在內地的人，在感覺上都以為新疆的環境特殊，社會現象一定也有些異樣，其實一點也不然。你在內地所看不慣的事，這裏都有，在內地工作，不是常常發生「副圈子」「鬧派系」的人事問題嗎？這裏並不僅於人事方面，並有「政治」「民族」問題滲雜其內。儘管新疆人才缺乏，但人浮於事的現象並未因之减退。在迪化，記者有一個在某機關裏當中級職員的朋友，我看他一天到晚已已經夠淸閑的了，可是他供職的機關仍在招考工作人員。我問他：「你們還要添人做甚麽？」他表示離編制的人數還差的遠呢。這也就把新疆造成了一種不調和的現象，一種畸形的發展！</p>
<p>社會風氣可怖</p>
<p>在新疆，記者覺得我所遇到的漢族朋友，都比內地的朋友闊綽。那怕一個很小的公務員，或一個起碼的軍官，也會如流水似的花錢，他們那種大方勁，眞使我自慚。我顯得是那樣小氣而未見過世面。「他們那里來的那麼多的錢呢」這始終是個疑問。是貪污來的嗎？其中也許有，不過我敢保險，絕非整個如此，因為我知道有許多人的確很窮，一個窮小子為什麽竟這樣不在乎呢？也許是社會風氣使然吧！不過，最使你看不慣的是那些胖商人及一些高級人士，他們那種腐化的樣子，真会使你驚奇。固然在高級官員中也不乏關心暸解邊疆的明智之士，不過太少了。極普遍的都在打算着怎樣「升官」·「發財」·「找女人」·（尤其是「找二轉子」）在跳舞廳·大飯店一類最容易花錢的地方，都看得見他們的影子。在迪化，一個中級軍官向我表示：如果一個軍官在迪化不會跳舞，那算是最大的缺陷。講賭，新疆漢人賭具比內地還全，闊人們是打麻將或撲克，下層階級的人是蹲城牆跟底下擲殽子或壓宝，連守城的士兵都在城樓下摸紙脾。我曾在一個很小的縣份里住了幾天，看到那裏漢人賭錢的情形，眞是是目怵心驚。商人·軍人·公務員，天天聚在一起睹，他們大部分的日子都消磨在這上面了，其他一切似乎與他們無關的！</p>
<p>希望多多努力</p>
<p>記者未到新疆前，以為新疆的漢人都要比內地的人對「新疆問題」多一層的認識，因為處在這種「民族」「政治」都很複雜的地區內，會由複雜的環境養成一種複雜的頭腦，可是我完全想錯了。新疆的漢族商人和上海的奸商別無二致，「囤積」·「居奇」·「製造黑市」，無一不精，甚至比上海的商人還膽大妄為，因為這裘沒有戰火的刺激，沒有多少輿論的指責。當局有時連蒼蠅也不敢拍一個。這眞是够悲哀的。</p>
<p>我愛新疆，所以我對新　。拓荒者印象特別深，說的話也許過火了一點，但我的心地的純潔，期望的股切，該是不言可喻的，希望新疆有志靑年多多努力！</p>

        <h1>1948.12.21</h1>
<h3>Sun Ke Announces Continuation of Efforts, Until Honorable and Peaceful Resolution is Achieved; New Cabinet to Hold First Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] Following his acceptance of the mandate to form a cabinet, Sun Ke hosted foreign reporters at his official residence in the Mausoleum area at 6:30 PM on the 20th, formally announcing the new cabinet's policies and the names of some of its members. Sun conferred with Wang Chonghui and Wu Tiecheng again on the list of cabinet members before receiving the foreign reporters in his exquisite study. Madame Sun accompanied him. Sun was in good spirits and gave a brief report in fluent English, answering reporters' questions for about five minutes before leaving. Sun stated: "Having been entrusted with the mandate to form a cabinet, I have decided to proceed after consultations with various parties. The future cabinet will incorporate opinions from both within and outside the Party. The Kuomintang will adhere to its consistent principles and hopes for cooperation from all quarters. This cabinet is a combat cabinet and will continue fighting until an honorable peace is achieved." The full list of cabinet members has been finalized and will be reported to the President for release on the 21st. For now, I can inform you that the Vice-President will be Mr. Wu Tiecheng. The position of Foreign Minister was initially offered to Dr. Hu Shih, but he repeatedly declined. It has now been decided that Vice-President Wu will temporarily hold the position concurrently. Those entering the cabinet from within include Weng Wenhao, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Chen Lifu, all as political councilors, to jointly discuss major national policies." A foreign reporter asked, "Will the new cabinet surrender to the Communists?" Sun replied firmly, "Surrender? Absolutely not!" Sun also stated, "We do not intend to surrender to the Communists. Surrendering to the Communists would make China a second Poland or Czechoslovakia." During the Q&amp;A session, Sun hinted that a compromise with the Communists was not impossible. However, he emphasized that both sides must be sincere for a compromise to be reached, implying that the Communists had repeatedly refused to negotiate with the government. With that, the reception concluded. Since Sun began forming the cabinet, he has primarily targeted foreign reporters in Nanjing and Shanghai, leading some to believe that the Sun cabinet places emphasis on international relations and diplomacy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, issued a brief statement at a press conference held at his residence on the evening of the 20th, stating that the selection of new cabinet members after five or six days of discussions, was finally completed on the evening of the 20th. The list will be submitted to the President for review on the evening of the 20th, and will be officially released on the 21st. He originally intended to invite people from all parties inside and outside the Kuomintang to participate in the cabinet as much as possible, but regrettably, some people did not accept the invitation, such as Dr. Hu Shih. He originally intended to invite him to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but it didn’t work out. The post of Foreign Minister will now be temporarily held concurrently by Wu Tiecheng, the proposed Vice-President. Sun then announced that Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Chen Lifu, and Zhang Zhizhong had all agreed to participate in the new cabinet. A foreign reporter asked Sun if the new cabinet would "continue its campaign to suppress the Communists." Sun replied, "The government will continue to fight the bandits until a victorious peace is achieved." Another reporter then asked, "Is there any possibility of the government surrendering to the Communists?" Sun was surprised to hear this, and immediately declared in a solemn tone that this was absolutely impossible, and the repetition of Poland and Czechoslovakia should be taken as a warning. Finally, a foreign reporter asked again, "Then what is the possibility of compromise?" Sun immediately replied emphatically that the government is determined to suppress bandits and will never compromise lightly. After the end of the press conference, Premier Sun drove to the President's residence to submit the new cabinet list.</p>
<h3>New Cabinet List to Be Announced Today; Wu Tiecheng Temporarily Concurrently Foreign Minister; Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Zhang Zhizhong, and Others to Serve as Political Councilors</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] Sun Ke's cabinet, after four days of preparation, was finally formed on the 20th. After formally announcing this matter to foreign reporters at 6:30 PM, Sun took the list of his cabinet members to see the President, requesting approval. It is scheduled to be submitted to the Kuomintang Central Political Committee for approval and announced on the 21st, and then officially take office on a scheduled date. Sun's cabinet formation had gone through several difficulties. The last three days were especially crucial to its success or failure. Sun insisted on establishing a "cabinet of heavyweights," but after he repeatedly invited various heavyweights in Shanghai and Nanjing, and they all declined, he gradually became discouraged. He intended to resign the mandate of forming the cabinet to the President, but the President comforted him and instructed Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and others to fully assist him. On the evening of the 19th, the heavyweights rushed around to discuss separately, and on the morning of the 20th, they also jointly saw the President, and an agreement was reached. This difficult-to-produce Sun Ke cabinet was formed with the invitation of the Kuomintang heavyweights to join the cabinet. Sun's plan to invite the heavyweights to participate has now almost all been fulfilled. In addition to Wu Tiecheng serving as Vice-President and temporarily concurrently holding the position of Foreign Minister, Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Zhang Zhizhong, and Weng Wenhao all serve as political councilors without concurrently holding ministerial positions, fulfilling their responsibility of assistance. According to sources, the other ministers are: Finance Minister Xu Kan will continue to serve, and other possible changes include Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, Minister of National Defense Yu Dawei, Minister of Social Affairs Zhong Tianxin, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chen Ce, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Bai Yunti, Director of the Information Bureau Shen Changhuan. The Ministry of Education and the National Resources Commission may not change. Minister of Interior Peng Zhaoxian and Minister of Justice Xie Guansheng have expressed their firm resignations. The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry may still be a member of the Youth Party and will not be changed. As for the political councilors of the Democratic and Youth Parties, it is not yet known whether there will be any changes. It was previously decided that the Secretary-General would be Wu Shangying, and Zuo Gong would be the Deputy Secretary-General. It is now known that this has changed and it is possible that Li Weiguo will continue to serve, and some say that Duan Benkai may be appointed Secretary-General. The new cabinet list will be announced on the 21st, and the first political affairs meeting will be held on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Sun Ke recently announced the formation of a "wartime cabinet," which may conduct peace talks with the Communists under the conditions of "honorable peace." Sun stated: His cabinet will never surrender to the Communists but will fight the Communists until achieving "honorable peace." Sun was ordered to form a cabinet three weeks ago and formally announced the establishment of his cabinet organization at a press conference on the evening of the 20th. He also made a surprising statement that the National Government is now willing to conduct peace talks with the Communists. When asked, "What are the conditions for a peaceful resolution?" Sun replied, "This point must be discussed and decided later." Sun said that the new cabinet list will be submitted to the President for approval on the night of the 20th and will be announced on the 21st, but he revealed that the list includes Wu Tiecheng as Vice-President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs. Sun also stated: Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Zhang Zhizhong, Weng Wenhao, etc., will all be cabinet members who decide policies without holding ministerial positions. Sun said that the cabinet formation has been in constant consultation with the President and other senior Kuomintang leaders for days, and it was successful after six days of hard work. He continued that he had tried his best to accommodate the opinions of various factions within the party, but it was regrettable that several famous figures had refused his invitation to join the cabinet. On this point, he particularly pointed out that he originally intended to invite Dr. Hu Shih to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Dr. Hu was the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States and is now the President of National Peking University. It is rumored that he has been internally decided to be President Chiang's highest adviser.</p>
<p>Since the breakdown of the KMT-CPC "peace talks" in January of the 36th year of the Republic by the Executive Yuan, this is the first time that the Premier of the Executive Yuan has publicly stated that he is prepared to negotiate "honorable peace" with the Communists.</p>
<p>However, Sun also explained at the press conference that the new cabinet is not surrendering to the Communists immediately, but only willing to consider what he called "honorable peace."</p>
<p>However, Sun's statement clearly conflicts with the policies that Nanjing has always shown, because President Chiang urged the people to continue fighting under his leadership as late as early November of this year when the Northeast fell, just like the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>Sun has obtained the cooperation of Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Lifu, etc., and his so-called "cabinet of heavyweights" has been formed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 20th] Sun Ke formed a new cabinet on Monday evening and declared that he "will continue the war until an honorable peace is achieved." Sun did not deny the possibility of compromise and peace with the Communists. Sun said that the list of cabinet members will be submitted to President Chiang on Monday night and may be announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sun said at a press conference: "I guarantee that we will never surrender to the Communists immediately." Sun said that this kind of surrender would make China "a second Poland or Czechoslovakia." A reporter asked: Will the new cabinet compromise with the Communists? Sun said: "Compromise requires cooperation from both sides. The new cabinet is not a surrender cabinet." According to Sun's secretary, Sun once told President Chiang that he could not organize a "strong cabinet."</p>
<h3>Beiping Pingmin Daily Warns Communists Not to Destroy Cultural Relics</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 20th] The Pingmin Daily here published an editorial today, warning the Communist Party not to allow the ancient relics and cultural relics of the old capital to be destroyed by artillery fire. The article, entitled "Protect the Ancient Relics and Cultural Relics of the Old Capital," first stated: "The ancient relics and cultural relics of the old capital are the only things left to us by our ancestors that are worthy of pride. No matter what the reason, they must be preserved and cared for, and must not be destroyed by artillery fire." It continued: Commander-in-Chief Fu and the National Army under his command are stationed here by order of the Central Government and entrusted by the people. He has only heartache. The outer strongholds concentrate their forces in Beiping to achieve the task of protecting ancient relics and cultural relics. There is absolutely no reason to leave again to protect the old capital. In view of the fact that the National Army has not taken advantage of the convenience of a solid perimeter defense for consecutive days, and has spared no effort to maneuver more than ten miles away, it is enough to see his painstaking efforts to protect cultural relics and monuments. Only the Communist Party is the only one who can destroy the old capital. The article further pointed out: Beiping is by no means a must-contend place. Although Beiping has its political influence, it is not of great significance in terms of military value. If the political influence is reduced for the sake of winning a political stronghold, it is not only unwise, but also outweighs the gains. The article specifically stated that it is standing on the purely people's stand to express a little of the people's opinions to the Chinese people, and the motive for writing this article is not to make any comments on the current war, but to hope that the ancient relics inherited for thousands of years will not be destroyed by artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Candidates for New President of the Legislative Yuan Under Consideration by Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Chen Lifu, Vice-President of the Legislative Yuan, have both joined the Executive Yuan, and their positions in the Legislative Yuan should immediately submit their resignations in accordance with the law, so that the Legislative Yuan can elect a new president. It is known that the resignations of the two Suns and Chen have not been sent out as of midnight on the 20th. The candidates for the new president of the Legislative Yuan were previously rumored to be Wu Tiecheng, but now that Wu has also joined the cabinet, this statement has also become a thing of the past. It is rumored that Yan Huiqing may be elected. Yan is now in Shanghai. It is said that he has said that he is old and may not have the energy to take on the important task of President of the Yuan. The selection of this candidate is being considered by the highest authorities. If it is submitted quickly, it is expected that an additional meeting of the Central Standing Committee will be convened for discussion on the 21st. The second general assembly of the Legislative Yuan is about to end. After the regular meeting on the 21st, there will be three more sessions before the recess at the end of the month. Therefore, the election of the new president will inevitably proceed quickly, so that the national general budget for the next year can be reviewed and completed as scheduled before the end of the session.</p>
<h3>Huai River Entire Line Becomes Quiet; Canal Line Recovers Jieshou</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 20th] The front line in Huaibei is calm, with no fierce battles. The military transportation in Huainan is very busy, and the people here are more at ease than before.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] After the battle of Shuangduiji, Liu Bocheng's and Chen Geng's bandit troops and Huang Wei's corps were exhausted and crippled, and they are now fleeing to the northwest Yellow Flood area to lie dormant and take a short breather. Now the entire Huai River line is very quiet, and only Wuhe and Xuyi on the right wing have been infiltrated by bandits for two weeks, causing the area to be slightly unstable. It is reported that there are about ten incomplete bandit regiments hiding on both sides of the Huai River in this area. However, due to the strict air force blockade of the Huai River with patrolling flights, it is very difficult for them to smuggle and resupply in large numbers. The military has dispatched teams to search for and suppress the small groups of Communist bandits that have infiltrated the Huai River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 20th] Chen Yi's bandit troops, who were facing off against my Wang Yuming's troops between Yongcheng and Suxian, have been counterattacked by our army for several days. Due to heavy casualties, they retreated outside our army's firepower net to build fortifications and stubbornly resist and reorganize, so there have been no fierce battles in that area in recent days. (Another cable) The bandits between the Fei and Xie Rivers in Huaibei have been fleeing to the northwest for several days. There are no traces of bandits on the south bank of the Xie River. Our newly added large army has adjusted its deployment and is advancing towards Guzhen and Mengcheng.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Correspondent, 20th] Confirmed news: The National Army on the canal line, advancing northward from Mapengwan yesterday, continued to attack Jieshou, removing the bandit army's resistance with fierce artillery fire, and recovered Jieshou today. Also, the National Army advancing westward along the Yangtian Highway arrived at Renheji, on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 20th] Strong troops of the National Army are arriving in Zhai in a steady stream. Fanchuan Town, northwest of Taixian, has now been recovered by a certain unit of the National Army. It is learned that the authorities will send senior generals to Taichangchuan to take charge and supervise the suppression of the remaining bandits in Liangtai, so the people in Taicheng are more at ease.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Resurgence of War in Indonesia</h3>
<p>The long-standing Dutch-Indonesian conflict has worsened again due to the Dutch government's insistence on accepting conditions before resuming negotiations, ultimately leading to a breakdown. On the 18th, Dutch forces launched the most intense attack on Yogyakarta, the capital of the Indonesian Republic, with their most elite British and American-equipped troops. According to a war report issued by the Dutch military headquarters: "Dutch troops have crossed the defense lines in Java and Sumatra, and under the cover of naval and air forces, launched an assault on Indonesia. The results are as follows: (1) Dutch paratroopers have occupied the airfield near Yogyakarta; (2) Dutch ground forces are advancing on the capital 60 miles west of Yogyakarta; (3) Dutch marines have landed in east-central Java; (4) Other troops have entered the Sumatra area." At the same time, the Dutch government explained this military action, stating: "The military action in Indonesia is not a combat action aimed at the Indonesian Republican government and the Indonesian people who are willing to cooperate with the Netherlands, but a police action against terrorists who make constructive work impossible."</p>
<p>No matter how grandly the Dutch authorities explain their reasons, from the perspective of us Asian people, the resurgence of war in Indonesia is ultimately a misfortune for Asia. In diplomatic negotiations, the Netherlands maintained such an "overbearing" attitude, constantly threatening Indonesia with force. Finally, taking advantage of its military superiority, it did not hesitate to violate the sacred truce agreement and launch an offensive against Indonesia first. This not only exposed the imperialist face of the Netherlands towards Indonesia but also made it clear to the world who was striving for peace and who was creating war in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. Therefore, we cannot help but express our deep regret for the Dutch authorities' blind belief in force and reckless initiation of war, which caused the flames of war in Indonesia to reignite.</p>
<p>During World War II, Indonesia was also under Japanese occupation. Although subject to strict control by the Japanese army, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the general population did not diminish due to high pressure. In August 1945, when Japan announced its unconditional surrender, the Indonesian people believed that the opportunity for "freedom and independence" had arrived, and their desire for national self-determination reached its peak. Therefore, during the transitional period, disturbances inevitably occurred in various places. Unexpectedly, the British authorities, seeing the weakness of the Dutch garrison, entered the Batavia area in September to maintain local order, which aroused the resentment of the Indonesian people. New and old hatreds erupted at the same time, and the so-called Indonesian movement became uncontrollable, with clashes occurring everywhere with British and Dutch troops. Initially, the Dutch authorities were quite aware of the bigger picture, believing that the Indonesian movement was a world trend and irresistible. On February 10, 1946, they issued an enlightened declaration, allowing the Indonesian people to freely choose their future political system. However, this empty declaration failed to immediately bring peace to Indonesia. There were talks and fights, and fights and talks until a truce agreement was reached in October 1946. Negotiations continued, and another agreement was reached in March 1947, stipulating the establishment of the Federal Republic of Indonesia on January 1, 1949, which, although possessing sovereignty, would still be under the Dutch crown. Therefore, strictly speaking, the Indonesian issue has not yet been thoroughly resolved. Before long, this truce agreement became a scrap of paper. The resumption of war in Indonesia has made the situation in Southeast Asia even more serious. In order to stabilize Asia, the United States mediated, and in January 1948, the Dutch and Indonesian parties reached another agreement,勉使雙方相安於一時. Unexpectedly, within less than a year, the flames of war in Indonesia rekindled, which is an unfortunate event, whether for the benefit of both the Dutch and Indonesian parties or for the peace of Asia.</p>
<p>Now, the cannons of Yogyakarta are resounding in the sky, and the Indonesian people are fighting for freedom and independence and will never yield halfway. The Netherlands, taking advantage of its military superiority, will not give up halfway either. Therefore, the prospect for Indonesia is very bleak. The people of all Asian countries cannot stand idly by and cannot tolerate the Netherlands' approach to Indonesia. In particular, we Chinese, with millions of overseas Chinese who will be affected by the devastation of the war, must oppose the Netherlands' warlike policy. Our representative in the Security Council has strived to advocate that the Dutch and Indonesians should immediately resume negotiations, but it has not been successful due to the stubborn attitude of the Netherlands, which is inevitably disappointing. Now that the war in Indonesia has reignited, the people of all Asian countries can only take united action to protest the Netherlands' actions in Indonesia and demand that the Netherlands immediately and unconditionally cease hostilities, so that the Dutch authorities understand that in today's age of the people, no place in Asia can be a colony of another country again. In addition, we must also ask the Security Council to take swift action to extinguish the resurgence of war in Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Wei Daoming Reports at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly Meeting on Taiwan Currency and Food Policy; 110 Billion Taiwan Dollars Currently in Circulation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei 20th Dispatch] The Provincial Assembly held a general meeting today for the entire day for general reports and inquiries on administration. Chairman Wei and the directors of various departments and bureaus were present. In his general report, Wei elaborated in detail on the Taiwan currency and food policy, intending to explain the misunderstandings that the Taiwan currency is gradually inflating and that the food policy is harming farmers due to low grain prices. Subsequently, various assembly members raised questions, which were explained separately. Key points are as follows: (1) Taiwan's redemption of gold banknotes has been approved by the central government to serve as reserves for the Taiwan currency. (2) The current amount of Taiwan currency in circulation is 110 billion, which may increase to 160 billion in the future due to production needs. (3) The provincial government is considering reasonably revising the purchase price of surplus grain from large households. (4) The food supply is balanced. The cultivated area this year has exceeded the record. The past food shortages were caused by smuggling. (5) Regarding land leasing, the government can consider giving landowners priority. (6) Inter-provincial trade is based on barter trade in principle. Some inquiries focused on how to seek stability and prosperity for Taiwan, but there were no concrete solutions. Regarding public enterprises, there were still criticisms. Wei also admitted that management may be unsatisfactory in some areas. The assembly then made a temporary motion to form a public enterprise investigation committee to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<h3>Question of Compatriots from Other Provinces Moving to Taiwan; Wei Daoming Answers Questions from Assembly Members; Sufficient Food Supply; Apologizes for Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Wei Daoming stated at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly this morning: "At present, we must strengthen provincial defenses on the one hand and prevent the infiltration of traitors into Taiwan on the other hand. Regarding the former, the central government has made full arrangements on both the naval and air force sides in the province, so there is no need to worry. What should be carefully guarded against now is the infiltration of traitors and the spreading of rumors to confuse the public. As long as the people and the government cooperate closely, the security of Taiwan is absolutely guaranteed." During today's meeting, two assembly members believed that an increasing number of compatriots from other provinces are being evacuated to Taiwan, which the Taiwanese people warmly welcome, but because Taiwan's population is too large, this matter should be considered. They also expressed concern about how to use the large sums of money brought in for legitimate purposes, how to maintain Taiwan's tradition of thrift, and how to solve Taiwan's housing and food problems. Wei Daoming replied: "Most of the refugees in the mainland are moving to the southwestern provinces, and only a small number are coming to Taiwan. Among them are naval and air force personnel, or people who have long planned to come to Taiwan to start businesses. This is urgently needed to strengthen Taiwan's defenses and develop productive enterprises. As for those who have no businesses and come to Taiwan to live, they account for only a very small number. There is absolutely enough food to supply in Taiwan. What I am concerned about is the lack of housing, which is the current serious problem. Due to insufficient facilities in Taiwan, there is a housing shortage. I am very sorry to the people from other provinces who have come to Taiwan." Wei also stated: "At this time of tense world affairs, we may encounter typhoons and heavy rains at any time. We must help each other in the same boat. We must know that happiness and hardship are shared and inseparable. Only by jointly maintaining safety can we overcome difficult and dangerous situations."</p>
<h3>Passenger Limit Exceeded on Ship from Shanghai to Taiwan; Zhongxing Wheel to Be Fined Heavily</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Keelung, 20th] The Keelung Port Authority recently fined the Zhongxing Wheel NT$90 million for exceeding the passenger limit by 500 to 600 people on two occasions when it sailed from Shanghai to Keelung on the 8th and 17th of this month. According to Xu Zhikai, the person in charge of the ship, because passengers have been eager to cross the sea recently, many have forced their way onto the ship and order is difficult to maintain. The ship does have an excess of passengers, but it has been approved by the Shanghai Maritime Administration to increase the original limit to 1,600 people. The ship's life-saving equipment has been increased and can meet the needs of 2,000 people, so there is no danger in sailing at sea. The ship has carried as many as 2,200 to 2,500 passengers on its two recent voyages from Shanghai to Taiwan. Although the Shanghai Maritime Administration has approved its increase in the limit, it is still suspected of exceeding the limit.</p>

<h3>English News Items</h3>
<p>Steel Industry Nationalization Bill</p>
<p>The steel industry nationalization bill finally passed its second reading in the British House of Commons after three days of debate. In the cabinet system of Great Britain, when a political party holds a majority of seats in the House of Commons, all debates on bills are merely a form of political education for the people, and in substance, it is not necessarily able to influence whether the bill is passed or not. This steel industry nationalization bill looks set to pass its third reading and complete its statutory procedure in the House of Commons. According to the current system, it must then be sent to the House of Lords, where it is likely to be rejected. Therefore, if the government is determined to implement this policy, it must pass through the continued approval of the House of Commons in three sessions over two years before it can become law. However, the new "Parliament Act" proposed last November seeks to change two years to one year and three sessions to two, but this new Parliament Act itself was rejected by the House of Lords and must be based on the old method. If the new Parliament Act becomes law in the winter of 1949 according to the old law, then this steel industry nationalization bill could also become law before the 1950 general election.</p>
<p>The nationalization of important enterprises is the Labor Party's basic policy for implementing socialism. Since the Labor Party came to power in 1945, the first to be nationalized was the Bank of England, followed by coal mines, gas, electricity, transportation, and other items. The steel industry has probably encountered the greatest resistance to nationalization. Opponents of nationalization can raise many reasons, such as the efficiency of nationalized industries may not be higher than that of private ones, the steel industry is already under government supervision, and it is not appropriate to have such legislation in the country given the current international tensions... etc. However, as far as we can see, most of the arguments against are peripheral. If the Labor Party is determined to implement socialism, then it naturally cannot fail to fulfill its previous promise of nationalizing the steel industry, which can almost be said to be the foundation of all industries. However, its true implementation may still depend on whether the Labor Party wins the 1950 general election.</p>
<p>Southern Ireland and Britain</p>
<p>The Southern Irish government has finally submitted a bill to its parliament to repeal the "External Relations Act." The repeal of this External Relations Act is, in fact, the repeal of the relationship between the British monarch and Southern Ireland, and makes Southern Ireland no longer a member of the "British Commonwealth." In fact, Southern Ireland has long been an independent country, and they even maintained their neutral status in the last World War. Therefore, in theory, it only deprives Southern Ireland of a nominal king. In reality, there are still some effects. First, the people of Southern Ireland will henceforth (after the abolition of the External Relations Act) become foreigners in the United Kingdom. Regardless of occupation, etc., they will henceforth be treated the same as ordinary foreigners and will not be able to enjoy the freedom and convenience enjoyed by the people of the United Kingdom. This is somewhat of an impact because there are many Southern Irish people in the United Kingdom. Second, Southern Ireland can no longer enjoy "Imperial Preference" in business dealings. However, according to the rulers of Southern Ireland, they believe that these can all be agreed upon by treaty. However, in any case, this must also be among the important considerations of the Southern Irish government. Therefore, not long ago, although Southern Ireland did not participate in the Prime Ministers' Conference of White Dominions, it still had contact with the prime ministers. Recently, it also sent representatives to Paris to consult with the personnel of various Dominions attending the United Nations. According to Southern Ireland's view, the repeal of this External Relations Act will not weaken its relationship with the United Kingdom and the various Dominions, but will strengthen it; they just do not want this name.</p>
<p>Following this issue, one possibility is that one or two other Dominions also intend to no longer have a nominal "king." The second is that after Southern Ireland abolishes the External Relations Act, it may feel the need to merge Northern and Southern Ireland (Northern Ireland is currently part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain). It will probably take some thought on how to solve these problems. But in the current international situation, it is not credible to say that this is the disintegration of the "British Commonwealth."

<h3>The CCP as Seen by the British</h3>
<p>Is an Orthodox Marxist</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] British people hold extremely divergent opinions on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). British conservatives firmly believe that the CCP is an orthodox Marxist. They believe that if our country were to embrace communism, it would only add another vassal state to the Soviet Union. Conservative MP McLean wrote in today's Daily Telegraph: "If China is allowed to embrace communism, it will become like Outer Mongolia or Romania and Poland, and fall under the rule of the Soviet Union." The diplomatic correspondent of The Times wrote in the newspaper today that he reached the same conclusion based on Mao Zedong's recent article published in the journal of the Communist Information Bureau. He said: The CCP is by no means a disguised Marxist.</p>

<h3>Tung Oil in Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter, Yushan</p>
<p>In the midst of promoting production and striving to increase foreign exchange earnings, tung oil, as one of China's special products, should be valued! The use of tung oil is not only as an ordinary paint, but in today's advanced chemical industry, tung oil has become an important raw material for all military industries. The manufacture of airplanes, warships, and guns all requires tung oil. Tung oil can also be used in medicine, preservatives, insecticides, and to make electrical insulation paints. In addition, it can also be refined into gasoline substitutes.</p>
<p>Among tung oil production in China, Sichuan has the most, followed by Guangxi, and Guangxi can be said to be a rising star. Guangxi planted tung trees on a large scale. As early as 1931, the provincial authorities vigorously promoted the planting of tung trees in order to develop special products and increase exports. By 1935, it was roughly estimated that the area planted with tung trees in the province had reached 1.23 million mu, producing 230,000 dan of tung oil, second only to grain and accounting for 16.36% of total exports. This was the first sign of increased tung oil production in Guangxi. By 1937, the area planted with tung trees had reached more than 2.56 million mu, producing more than 289,000 dan of tung oil, accounting for one-quarter of total exports and taking the top spot. Although it has declined since then due to the impact of the war, it has always remained a major source of wealth.</p>
<p>Although tung trees grow relatively widely, they also require a certain environment. They are not cold-resistant and can grow if the winter temperature is above zero degrees. They need a lot of rain during growth and little rain during maturity. If there is too much rain, the oil content will not be high. Areas with a lot of rain and strong sunshine in June, July, August, and September are most suitable for growth. There is a saying, "Small fruit in June with drought, little oil in July with drought," which means this. The soil is suitable except for extremely high mountains, with loam and sandy loam being the most suitable. Acidic and humus-rich soil is even better, while sticky soil and soil with too much lime and alkalinity are prone to discoloration. Guangxi spans the temperate and tropical zones, has a mild climate, and has a lot of rain. The calcium-rich soil containing lime is often leached into residual soil by rain, making it most suitable for growth. More than 70 of the province's 100 counties and cities produce tung oil, which shows how widespread its distribution is. The tung oil production centers are in the central and northeastern parts of the province, including Guanyang, Longsheng, Fuchuan, Zhaoping, Rong County, Tianyang, Du'an, Yishan, Quan County, He County, Liujiang, Sanjiang, Luorong, Longshan, Shanglin, and other places. The province's average planting area is 253,723 mu, the average annual output is 328,817 dan, and the export volume is 211,880 dan, accounting for more than 70%.</p>
<p>The quality of tung oil produced in the central region is the best, followed by the Yujiang River basin. Tung oil production has always used traditional pressing methods, so it is not very pure. In the past, the province established a office at the Wuzhou Tung Oil Export Office to inspect tung oil for export. The tung oil produced in this province is mostly yellowish-brown in color, with a specific gravity (at 15.5 degrees Celsius) of up to 0.9430, an acid value of entering, a saponification value of 195, and a refractive index (at 25 degrees Celsius) of 1.5000. According to the Hua Situo test, it solidifies in seven and a half minutes and is not sticky when cut.</p>
<p>Currently, the increase in tung oil production and the improvement of quality require urgent efforts and improvements. The province's plan is to increase the planting of tung trees by 1 million mu and 600,000 trees every year starting in 1947, with the expectation of increasing production by 300,000 dan annually starting in 1950. The government will send personnel to supervise and manage the cultivation of improved varieties, technical improvement, and pest and disease control. The oil extraction method is also planned to be changed to use new machinery, and it is planned to use its own raw materials to build factories on a large scale to manufacture paints in order to supply domestic consumption and promote exports at the same time, in order to create a new outlet for the province's tung oil industry.</p>
<p>The provincial government has selected 34 counties and cities this year that are equipped with cooperative loans, grain loans, and relief plowing cattle to promote tung tree planting and afforestation, including Pingle, Fuchuan, Xing'an, Yishan, Wuxuan, Pingnan, Xiang County, Qianjiang, Zhongshan, Gongcheng, Cangwu, Lingchuan, Rong County, Liujiang, Lingui, Jiabin, Liujiang, Luorong, Baishou, Guilin, Hechi, Lipu, Wuming, Yongfu, Xiuren, Liucheng, Quan County, Shanglin, Yining, Suilu, Ziyuan, Mengshan, Guanyang, and Guixian. The first 24 counties have been completed, with a total afforestation area of 45,600 mu and a total of 1,596,626 trees planted, including 594,993 tung trees. This number is naturally still very small compared to the province's wasteland. The province's wasteland area is 20,750, and the area is less than one-tenth. This cannot be self-satisfying.</p>
<p>At present, the central government attaches great importance to a major export commodity that has historically occupied the main export position. In order to stimulate production, promote exports, and earn foreign exchange, it has clearly ordered that the purchase prices in various places be allowed to refer to international prices, deducting various expenses and legal export profits as the standard, and adjusting them appropriately to ensure supply and facilitate exports. Pay attention to avoiding exploitation by middlemen, and the prices quoted should be directly beneficial to tung farmers. At the same time, the government provides merchants with transportation conveniences to prosper special products and develop foreign trade. This measure is obviously very necessary.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 19th] Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker declared at a press conference today that he hoped that the Dutch military action against the Republic could be ended in a few days.

<h3>US Supreme Court Refuses to Hear Appeals of Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>[News Report] Washington, 21st Broadcast: The United States Supreme Court has refused to hear the appeals of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] MacArthur met with McLean, administrative assistant to Keenan, prosecutor of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, on the evening of the 19th, possibly to discuss the US Supreme Court's action on the appeals of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<h3>US Government Is Very Interested in the Proposal to Arm Japan to Defend Against Communism; It Is Expected to Be Opposed by the USSR in the Far East Commission</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Senior government officials on the 20th expressed keen interest in the proposal to establish a 150,000-man armed security force in Japan to curb communist plots. According to this proposal, advocated by Acheson, former right-hand man of MacArthur in Japan, MacArthur himself also agreed to strengthen Japan's national defense and enhance the status of the democratic government. Some government officials, looking forward to the time when the occupying forces withdraw from Japan, believe that it would be a mistake to have only 18,000 police officers currently equipped with pistols in all of Japan once the US occupying forces withdraw. The Japanese constitution, drafted under Allied supervision, prohibits the creation of any military force and guarantees that Japan will strive for international peace. A security force would not be enough to make Japan a threat to world peace, but on the other hand, it would be a powerful weapon to maintain peace and security. It is pointed out that this army could have rifles, mortars, machine guns and other light weapons, but would not be allowed to equip artillery and a navy, as launching a war requires the cover of the latter two. Diplomats believe that with a total population of 80 million in Japan, Acheson only advocates a security force of 150,000, and the number should not be increased. The United States has not yet decided whether to propose the establishment of a Japanese security force, but if this plan is submitted to the Far East Commission, the decision-making body for occupation, it will be strongly opposed by the Soviet Union. Authorities here said that even without the communist threat, the Japanese government must have a strong security force to guard against extreme right-wing elements, who had controlled Japan's fate before the war.</p>
<h3>Nehru Announces Improved India-Pakistan Relations</h3>

<h3>Yoshida Cabinet in Difficult Situation Due to Allied Headquarters' New Economic Principles Conflicting with the Policies of the Liberal Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Democratic Liberal Party of Shigeru Yoshida is greatly shaken today due to the temporary directive issued by the Allied Headquarters to stabilize the Japanese economy. The Allied Headquarters' directive severely criticized the party's free-market economic measures, and Yoshida's cabinet has now fallen into a difficult situation. Observers say that the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party will be forced to change its economic policies, or it will not be able to remain in power, as the opposition parties are all using the Allied Headquarters' nine-point economic principles to achieve their political goals. Today, the opposition parties loudly demanded Yoshida's resignation in parliament in order to implement the Allied Headquarters' economic instructions. The industrial sector is pleased with the Allied Headquarters' nine-point economic principles, believing that this is an indication that the United States will provide Japan with a large amount of aid in the coming years. The announcement of the nine-point economic principles clearly demonstrates the United States' determination to fully assist Japan in achieving economic self-sufficiency. The industrial sector expects that continued large-scale U.S. aid to Japan will accelerate Japan's industrial production.</p>

European countries have no right to carry out any acts of aggression in Asia. India's departure from British rule is equivalent to the end of all imperialism and colonialism.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Gan Xi Na Jia, 19th] The conference of the two autonomous regions of India and Pakistan passed a motion today stating that Indonesia should be granted full independence so that it can fulfill its tasks in Asian and international affairs, which is of great importance to India, and emphasized that the people of India deeply sympathize with the Indonesian people and the traditional ties between the two nations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 19th] East Indonesian Prime Minister Agung and cabinet members submitted their resignations tonight.

The attitude of the government of West Java, another major unit of the Indonesian Federation, is still unknown.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 20th] Following the East Indonesian cabinet, the West Java cabinet also submitted its resignation on the night of the 19th.

<h3>British and American Tanks and Aircraft Actually Used to Attack Indonesia</h3>
<p>Philippine Newspaper Believes Britain and America Cannot Help but Feel Ashamed</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 20th] The people of the Philippines today deeply regret the recent "police action" of the Dutch government to overthrow the Indonesian Republic and capture Yogyakarta, believing that it is unwise to indirectly assist the Communist Party's propaganda plans in Southeast Asia. The U.S. government's failure to recognize the right of colonial peoples to freely choose their government is also a violation of the spirit of the Atlantic Charter and cannot be blameless. According to an editorial in the Manila Times today, the resumption of war in Indonesia is the most tragic example of the failure of the United Nations' work. British and American tanks and aircraft are the main weapons in this attack. If the British and American governments want to see the object of the attack as a nation determined and capable of crushing the Communist threat, they cannot help but feel ashamed. The initial result of this action is the victory of British and American tanks and aircraft. These weapons were originally made to defend freedom, but they were unexpectedly used for attack. The bombs dropped by aircraft in Java and Sumatra are nothing more than seeds of hatred, and the hatred of 70 million people and their friends has a far-reaching impact and cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Brockway, a veteran socialist who currently serves as the chairman of the British "Anti-Imperialist League," today sent a telegram to the Security Council, requesting it to immediately find a way to stop the Dutch military actions in Indonesia and to release Dr. Sukarno and other ministers of the Republic. The Anti-Imperialist League includes socialist representatives from India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Vietnam, and Byasu, as well as representatives from "anti-imperialist movements" in various European countries.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plots to Deplete U.S. Resources; Washington Cautiously Guards Against It; U.S. Export Controls Find Loopholes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. officials stated on the 19th that U.S. policy planners are carefully guarding against any attempt by the Soviet Union to weaken the United States by excessively depleting its resources. The authorities firmly believe that Moscow may exert pressure to cause a significant loss of U.S. funds and other resources in Cash, thereby weakening the United States economically. They say that the main point of the Soviet Union's plan is that communism will exhaust U.S. resources. The Soviet Union's unwillingness to reach agreements within the United Nations, its insistence on the Berlin blockade, and its efforts to promote international communism in order to incite chaos and harassment around the world are all considered to be in support of this principle.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. Senate's top investigation committee recently criticized serious shortcomings in U.S. export controls, demanding strict enforcement to ensure that goods shipped abroad do not flow into the Iron Curtain. The committee, led by Senator Ferguson, issued a report stating that current controls on export programs are now better, but many improvements are still needed. The report, "based on a long-term investigation into the so-called black market for export fake passports, proves that rare materials can eventually reach the Soviet Union and its satellite countries."</p>

<h3>Heavenly Maiden Scattering Flowers; Miracle at the White-Robed Nunnery in the Philippines; Just Listen to It, Just Listen to It</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Liba City, Philippines, 20th] A miracle of roses falling from the sky occurred yesterday in the White-Robed Nunnery here. News of this event has spread, and tens of thousands of believers are flocking to the nunnery today to worship.

There is also evidence of the Virgin Mary's appearance in Fatima, Portugal in 1947. Philippine Catholics are investigating the miracle in Liba City in order to report it to the Roman Catholic Church. Outside the gate of the White-Robed Nunnery today, there are small vendors selling heavenly flowers, and passersby are rushing to buy them without suspecting their authenticity. A Philippine official is willing to pay US$50 to buy them. Rumor has it that heavenly flowers can cure strange diseases. A child suffering from paralysis was healed immediately after smelling the flower petals and walked out healthy. According to the nuns, flowers have been falling many times since September 30. Mrs. Quezon, the widow of the former Philippine President, and Mr. and Mrs. Moran, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, have all witnessed it.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Public Education Exchange Method; Units Draw Lots to Determine Priority; Representatives Elected Today to Be Held at City Hall</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The improvement method for the exchange of gold and silver for public educators was decided by the city government meeting yesterday: It was decided that at exactly 2:00 PM this afternoon, representatives from various agencies should bring official letters to the first dining hall of the municipal government to draw lots to determine the order of exchange for each unit. This notice has been issued by the Shanghai Public Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee. Agencies that have not received the notice must also elect representatives on time and prepare official letters to participate in the lottery. Those who are absent will have their lots drawn by the municipal government. Yesterday's meeting was held at 5:00 PM in the City Hall conference room, with participants including responsible persons for gold and silver exchange businesses from the National Bank and the City Bank, as well as representatives from various agencies. Mayor Wu served as chairman and passed the following proposals: (1) There are many public education agencies in this city. In order to avoid congestion when exchanging gold, it is proposed to hold a lottery to facilitate the exchange procedures in sequence. Is this acceptable for public decision? Resolution passed. (2) Each unit of the central government and Jiangsu Province stationed in Shanghai, limited to units that have been allocated physical objects by the Shanghai Public Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee, shall send one representative to participate in the lottery. Is this acceptable for public decision? Resolution: A notice has been issued for the lottery to be held at the city government at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 21st). Please prepare official letters for your representatives to participate. Those who have not received the notice must also prepare official letters to participate. Those who are absent will have their lots drawn by the municipal government. (3) The agencies under the jurisdiction of this city, according to their nature, are divided into 15 units, namely the Municipal Council, the Municipal Government, and the eight bureaus of Civil Affairs, Finance, Public Works, Public Utilities, Health, Education, Social Affairs, and Land Administration, as well as the Civil Food Distribution Office, the Literature Committee, and the Mandatory Labor Supervision Group. Each unit shall send one representative to participate in the lottery. However, units under the jurisdiction of each bureau shall, in principle, have the bureau representative draw lots on behalf of the units under its jurisdiction. However, is the lot number drawn by the bureau representative the lot number of the affiliated units? Or will the bureau representative draw lots separately on behalf of the affiliated units to determine their lot numbers? Please make a public decision. Resolution: The municipal government will use the bureau as a unit, and the affiliated agencies will belong to each bureau as a single unit.</p>
<p>Detailed Rules for Exchange Methods Resolved</p>
<p>After detailed consultation, the meeting decided on the following detailed rules for the exchange of gold and silver for public educators: (1) The exchange of gold and silver dollars for public educators shall be handled by the Shanghai City Bank entrusted by the Central Bank. (2) Public educators (including employees such as job technicians and laborers) who exchange gold are limited to those who have been approved by the Shanghai Public Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee (hereinafter referred to as "this committee") to distribute physical objects in December 1948. Each person will be issued an application to exchange gold, permitting the exchange of one tael of gold or 49 silver dollars. (3) Applications for gold exchange permits will be sent by the City Bank to the committee for distribution to the general leaders of each physical object distribution unit, who will then forward them to each employee. (The procedure for each unit to receive the permits is the same as the procedure for receiving the physical object purchase certificate). At the same time, the committee will issue a "List of the Number of People Exchanging Gold," one for each agency. (4) Each employee should fill in the items specified on the permit in detail, and submit it along with their ID card and the price to the original work unit without having to queue up. (5) After collecting the permits and ID cards, each agency should carefully check the ID cards submitted by each employee to ensure that they have not exchanged gold before, and then stamp the permit with the seal of the agency and the name stamp of the person in charge. Prepare an official letter and submit it to the City Bank in total, and fill in the "List of the Number of People Exchanging Gold" (the numbers must be written in school handwriting), and submit it to the committee for review. After verifying that the number of people does not exceed the number of people receiving physical objects, the committee will add a verification stamp and forward the original to the City Bank for verification. (6) After receiving the permits, ID cards, and list of the number of people exchanging gold, the City Bank will process them in the order of the lot numbers drawn by each agency. The bank will notify each agency separately of the date for payment and gold exchange, which must be handled within the notified time limit. Those who fail to do so will be postponed and handled later. (7) Personnel who have already exchanged gold at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank will not be allowed to exchange gold within the prescribed period, as their ID cards have been stamped with an exchange stamp or punched. (8) If there are errors in the procedures for the exchange of gold by each unit, or if they do not comply with the regulations, for example, if a unit has a hundred people exchanging gold, but ten of them have permits but no ID cards, or the ID cards have already been stamped with an exchange stamp or punched, or the name on the permit does not match the name on the ID card, or the price is incomplete, etc., all of them will be temporarily retained. First, handle the ninety people. After all the units that drew lots have finished, then handle the supplement. If there are many units with similar situations, they will also be handled in the order of the original lot numbers when supplementing. Therefore, each unit should handle these procedures with special care to avoid confusion and to be quick. (9) All payments to the City Bank by each agency must be in cash. (10) Each unit should send one staff member to assist the City Bank in handling the various procedures on the day scheduled for the unit to exchange gold. (11) The fineness or weight of each tael of gold exchanged may be insufficient or exceeded. The City Bank may calculate the receipt or refund based on the actual amount, but each deposit slip will still be based on 1,000 yuan, without refund or supplement.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Application Forms Scheduled to Be Issued on the 23rd</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the second batch of applications for the exchange of gold and silver will be issued on the 23rd and will be processed on the same day by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, as well as four newly added units: the China Trust Bureau, the Postal Savings Bureau, the Cooperative Bank, and the City Bank.

<h3>Cigarette Industry Petition; Satisfactory Result; Three Goals Proposed; Ministry of Finance Agrees to Consider</h3>
<p>The Shanghai cigarette factories have been affected by the change in the method of collecting cigarette tax rates, the weakness of market purchasing power, the severing of sales channels in North China, and the excessively low tax rates in South China, which have affected production and sales and made it impossible to maintain production, causing serious situations of factory shutdowns and worker unemployment in this city. Zhou Xuexiang, of the Cigarette Workers Welfare Committee, in view of the long-term shutdowns that endanger workers' lives and social order, accompanied eleven worker representatives, including Cheng Shunxing, Yao Ligen, and Zhu Desheng, to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department in Beijing, focusing on the crux of the problem. The heads of the various ministries personally received them. In addition to stating the workers' suffering and the increasing number of factory shutdowns and worker unemployment, especially female workers, who account for more than 70% of all cigarette industry workers and have not received a penny of wages for three or four weeks, the representatives proposed the following petition goals: (1) Restore the old formula of 75% taxation for cigarette taxes to facilitate factory production and enable workers to have work to do. (2) Cigarette taxes in South China should be levied at the same price and amount as in Shanghai to facilitate external sales and maintain full wage income for pieceworkers. (3) Please ask the government to provide general industrial loans to cigarette factories so that they can quickly resume production and workers can resume work as soon as possible. As a result, they were all sympathetic to the crisis in the Shanghai cigarette industry and the suffering of unemployed workers, and agreed to immediately conduct a thorough investigation and remedy the situation. The Ministry of Finance, in particular, in view of the abnormal state of cigarette factory production, where cigarette taxes are intended to increase but instead decrease within half a month, decided to issue a clear written reply to Shanghai within three days. Zhou told reporters at the end that Shanghai is the economic capital of the country, and its stability and prosperity are of great importance. Therefore, although the petition is ostensibly to maintain factory production, it is actually closely related to the interests of workers. Therefore, the purpose of the petition is satisfactory and far-reaching, and this is expected. However, during this period, it is hoped that all workers can consider the difficulties of the times. With the spirit of sharing weal and woe and solidarity, we will tide over the difficulties, wait patiently for the resumption of work, and never act rashly and overstep the bounds, so that the legitimate motives of the workers will be subject to legal interference, resulting in consequences that are both undesirable and unattainable.</p>

<h3>General Manager of the Great China Hotel; Assaults and Knocks Out Director's Teeth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Dai Buxiang, the general manager of the Great China Hotel on Tibet Road, has been in office for many years. A month ago, Xu Qiuhui, the chairman of the hotel, sent director Yuan Xifan as a representative to discuss the renewal of the contract with Dai. Due to disagreements, a dispute occurred, which escalated into a physical altercation. The two parties went to the Old Gate Police Station. After mediation, it was temporarily settled. At about 8:30 PM the night before, Xu convened a shareholders' meeting on the seventh floor of the hotel, and Dai was also invited to attend. During the discussion, Yuan and Dai again discussed the contracting issue, and another conflict arose. After a disagreement, Dai punched Yuan in the face, knocking out two of Yuan's front teeth and causing his mouth to be filled with blood. Xu then called the Old Gate Police Station, and Section Chief Jiang personally led police officers Xu Guizhu, Li Bochuan, and others to investigate and took both parties to the station for questioning.

<h3>Five Defendants, Including Teachers of Punan Middle School; Sentenced with Probation; Altered Employment Contracts to Add Salaries and Allowances; Jointly Inflicted Bodily Harm</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Land Court announced the verdict yesterday in the case of Ding Bangshou, the director of teaching affairs of Punan Middle School, forging documents and fighting with the principal, Sheng Xiaokang. Ding Bangshou was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for using forged service certificates, causing damage to others, and was fined 30 yuan for jointly inflicting bodily harm, with a three-year probation. Zhou Shuquan, Zhu Zongquan, Sheng Xiaokang, and Zhu Miaotao were each fined 20 yuan for jointly inflicting bodily harm, with a two-year probation. The altered employment contract was confiscated. Ding Bangshou originally served as the director of teaching affairs at the private Punan Middle School. At the end of the summer semester this year, he was dismissed due to disagreements with Sheng Xiaokang, the principal of the school. Ding was unwilling to accept this, so he used a blank employment contract printed by the school, added salaries and allowances, totaling 15 piculs of white rice, and used this as an excuse to demand the payment of 5 piculs of white rice owed. At 10:00 AM on July 26th, he invited teachers Ju Shuquan and Zhu Chongquan to go to the school to demand the owed salary, which led to a conflict with Principal Sheng. Ding injured Sheng's right eye. Sheng's mother tried to mediate from the side and was also injured. The school worker Zhu Miaotao heard the news and rushed to help, kicking Ding in the waist. Zhou and Zhu also participated in the beating. Sheng reported the incident to the police, who transferred them to the Land Inspection Office for investigation and filed a public prosecution.</p>
<h3>Record of Survival from the Jiangya Steamer Disaster</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xueli</p>
<p>On December 3rd, I received orders from the hospital (Note: The author was an internal medicine physician at the First Red Cross Hospital) to return temporarily to the Yangming Hospital in Yuyao for internal medicine work. I boarded the Jiangya Steamer at 3:30 PM and it departed at 4:00 PM. I had dinner in the dining hall at 5:30 PM, and returned to my cabin around 6:00 PM to chat with fellow cabinmates, Mr. Gu and Mr. Qin. I was content and unaware of the impending disaster. In the midst of our conversation, a deafening sound suddenly erupted, shaking the entire ship. Then, the lights went out. The sounds of metal breaking and clashing, objects falling and scattering, cries for help from the lower cabins, and the terrified wails of children filled the air. Realizing something was wrong, I, along with Mr. Qin and Mr. Gu, forced our way out of the cabin in the darkness. We searched for a ladder among the crowd and, with the help of two crew members in white, climbed onto the deck. By this time, the chaos was even worse. The radio had been destroyed, and the steam whistle, intended to send a distress signal, only managed a single, incomplete blast before falling silent.</p>
<p>People on the ship shouted: "The boiler has exploded!"</p>
<p>Then, we heard people on the ship shout: "The boiler has exploded! Remain calm and await rescue!" This only heightened the panic. The glass windows and planks were shattered by the struggling crowds, and people mistakenly fell into the ocean in the darkness. The Jiangya had already begun to sink, and many third- and fourth-class passengers perished instantly. At the same time, countless people surged onto the deck, trampling each other in the process. I fell and struggled to my feet several times. Soon, people were fighting to board lifeboats and grab life preservers, desperately struggling for survival in the darkness. The scene was like something out of the underworld. At that moment, I maintained my composure, looked around, and waited for a ship. Whenever I saw a glimmer of light, we worked together to shout for help, sound whistles, or shine flashlights to try to attract attention. However, a couple of large steamers and several small sailboats that passed by ignored us completely and sailed away. The crowd erupted in angry curses, adding to the anguish.</p>
<p>The Jinyuanli Arrives, Rescuing Hundreds</p>
<p>Around 9:00 PM, we spotted a large motorized sailboat speeding towards us, identified as the Jinyuanli, acting as a volunteer rescuer on the orders of its owner. The crowd was overjoyed and rushed towards the area where the sailboat was approaching the Jiangya. In that instant, hundreds of people were saved. However, the chaos at that time was even greater than before. The strong pushed ahead, and many lost their footing. Countless elderly and weak were pushed into the sea. Finally, a large number of passengers hung suspended from the Jinyuanli's rescue ropes. The ropes broke under the weight, sending countless more into the sea. At this critical moment, I realized that the small boat was overcrowded and feared a secondary disaster. Believing that the first boat would surely radio for help from other vessels, I waited calmly for a lifeboat, hoping for another chance at survival.</p>
<p>After another hour, several more ships passed near the Jiangya, including another large steamer, which sailed away into the distance without showing any compassion or offering any assistance.</p>
<p>The Maohe Rescues Two or Three Hundred Passengers</p>
<p>Later, the Maohe, a ship heading to Zhoushan, heard our cries and came to our aid, hovering hesitantly for some time. At that time, there were only two or three hundred passengers left on the deck, and the rising seawater had already submerged most of it. A crew member shouted to the Maohe for help, informing them of the approximate number of survivors. The Maohe then used a powerful searchlight to scan the area several times before sending two small sampans to bring someone aboard to discuss the situation. After being informed of the facts, the Maohe agreed to use the sampans for rescue trips. They made dozens of round trips, first rescuing women and children, then men. I was finally rescued as well. About half an hour after boarding the Maohe, I looked back at the Jiangya, only to see the flagpole and the top of the smokestack still visible above the water. I couldn't help but shudder. The Maohe rescued approximately two or three hundred people. After the rescue, the Maohe, also overloaded, ran aground on a sandbar and had to drop anchor to await assistance from other vessels. Around 1:00 AM after midnight, the Haijin arrived and used small motorboats to ferry us, the distressed passengers, to safety. While on the Maohe, I looked around at the rescued crowd. Most were covered in mud and blood, their clothes torn. Some had lost loved ones, while others were the sole survivors of their families. A wave of grief washed over everyone, and they wept inconsolably. Their faces were blackened, and they looked at each other with pity. The Haijin took us back to Pier No. 7, then transferred us to a ferry to Pier No. 3. There, we saw thousands of family members and friends craning their necks in anticipation, many wailing in despair at the sight of those who had not survived. It was a truly horrific tragedy.</p>
<p>The Crew Lacked Public Spirit, Only Caring About Their Own Escape</p>
<p>In the aftermath of my survival, the horrific scene of the Jiangya disaster is still vivid in my mind. I would like to offer the following points to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the maritime industry, in the hope of preventing a recurrence of such a tragedy. (1) Overloading ships with passengers and cargo should be strictly avoided. (2) Seagoing vessels should have backup radio equipment in case of a power failure, so that they can still send distress signals even if the main system is damaged. (3) Seagoing crews should be trained in rescue techniques for themselves and passengers. In this Jiangya disaster, most passengers did not receive life preservers, leading to fierce competition. The ropes holding the lifeboats were not even released. Passengers cried out for help, but no one attended to them. Most of the crew only cared about saving themselves, demonstrating a complete lack of public spirit. (4) Baggage should be inspected before boarding to check for dangerous goods. (5) All parts of the engines should be thoroughly checked before departure to ensure that there are no problems. (6) How to promote the ethics of maritime personnel, and how to punish selfish ships that do not offer assistance in times of disaster.</p>
<h3>Sullivan Factory Refrigerator Pipe Explosion Injures Worker</h3>

<h3>Zang Da'erzi Damage Compensation: Court Orders Payment of 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the case of Zang Da'erzi, the father of Zang Genbao, who was killed on September 23, 1946, after being instigated by the Spaniard Lai Lingnai to be assaulted by an American soldier, the plaintiff initially requested damages based on the cost of living at the time, totaling 145,100,400 Legal Tender. However, due to the depreciation of the currency and the currency reform, the above amount, when converted to gold yuan, was extremely small. Therefore, the plaintiff submitted a request to the court to use the rice price at the time of the judgment as the standard for converting to gold yuan, totaling 48,366.80 gold yuan. The court held a hearing the other day. The defendant's lawyer did not appear. The court found that the amount requested by the plaintiff was too large, and after considering the circumstances of both parties, ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff 10,000 gold yuan, and dismissed the remainder of the claim.</p>

<h3>Christmas Research</h3>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, and the "joy to the world" Christmas is coming soon.</p>
<p>Christmas is undoubtedly the day of the birth of Jesus Christ; celebrating Christmas is to commemorate this savior of mankind. But was Jesus Christ born on December 25th? It has always been a mystery in history.</p>
<p>The currently circulating story of Jesus' birth is based on the accounts in the Bible. The Bible says that Jesus' mother, Mary, was an unmarried virgin who became pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Her fiancé, Joseph, learned of this and was deeply skeptical. While he was hesitating, he had a dream telling him the reason for his fiancée's pregnancy, confirming that it was through the Holy Spirit. It also said that this child was coming into the world to save people, to free them from all their sins, and that he was the savior of all the world. Joseph's doubts were thus dispelled, and he married Mary.</p>
<p>A few days before Jesus was born, an order came down to conduct a census, and all people had to return to their place of origin. Joseph and Mary also returned from Nazareth to Bethlehem to register. When they arrived in Bethlehem, they had not yet found an inn. Mary was about to give birth, so she gave birth to Jesus in a stable, and the manger became Jesus' cradle.</p>
<p>At the very moment of Jesus' birth, shepherds in the meadows outside Bethlehem saw a shining light in the sky, which greatly frightened them. At that moment, a host of heavenly soldiers, led by an angel, descended from the sky and said to the shepherds, "I am here to bring you good news. Today, in the city of David, the Savior Christ of all the world is born. You will find this baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Do not be afraid." After saying this, they ascended back into the sky. In the starry sky, the songs of praise to God could still be faintly heard.</p>
<p>The next morning, the shepherds went to Bethlehem according to the angel's words and found Jesus, and also met Joseph and Mary. The angel's words were confirmed. This good news quickly spread throughout the city; everyone knew that the Savior Christ had come. It was all spread from the mouths of the shepherds.</p>
<p>Although the Bible describes the story of Christ's birth, it does not specify the date; even the Book of Revelation, church history, or other books cannot find this answer. So, how did December 25th become Christmas? In the Bible dictionary, the Christmas entry says: "This festival began to be observed in the year 300 AD. The Western Church stipulated it on December 25th. The Eastern Church stipulated it on January 6th. However, this is the date stipulated by the Church and has no basis. And for hundreds of years, no one has observed this festival; it gradually progressed and then began to be observed."</p>
<p>In the Encyclopedia of Ethics and Religion, the explanation for Jesus' birth is: "...In the fourth century, the church decided to commemorate Jesus' birth, and later it became a common practice in the church. The Gospel of Fuchsia does not record in which month or day Jesus was born, but ancient people used December 25th as Christmas. It is not known on what basis they said this. Some say that the Jewish religion had a festival on this day, and the ancients used it as the day of Jesus' birth."</p>
<p>From the above two records, it is questionable whether Christmas is on December 25th. It is said that before the fifth century, there were several different versions of the date of Jesus' birth. One said it was January 6th, another said it was March 25th, and another said it was December 25th. Some people used the Hebrew calendar to calculate it, saying it should be April 20th. Others said it was May 20th, which was calculated using the Egyptian calendar.</p>
<p>The many possibilities of Jesus' birth date have left many Christians at a loss. However, for the past 1,560 years, December 25th has always been regarded as Jesus' birthday. It is said that December 25th was originally the Roman Saturnalia, and ancient Rome worshiped Saturn as the god of agriculture. In December, the agricultural work ended, which was the season of recreation. On December 25th each year, there was a grand celebration. In the fourth century, churches in various places became more and more developed day by day, and the number of believers also increased sharply. Many enthusiastic believers wanted to find a suitable way to commemorate this great savior Christ. However, there was no history to verify, and there were no traditional customs to follow, so they finally used the day of the Roman Saturnalia. In the twentieth century, everyone has forgotten the Saturnalia, but the grand and joyful Christmas will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>After December 25th was designated as Christmas, a dispute also occurred in England. England was a country where Christianity was developed. At that time, Puritans and heathens were divided into two factions. The discrimination was very severe. The Puritans said: December 25th Christmas was designated by heathens, not only could it not be echoed, but it was also considered a sin to insult God. Therefore, the Puritans set a penalty: anyone who echoed the heathen Christmas would be fined and paraded in public, or expelled from the country, or even executed. Every year, many people were punished because of this rule. When Cromwell dominated England, he went a step further and canceled all the festivals of the heathens; violators would be punished by the law.</p>
<p>Not only is the date of Jesus' birth impossible to verify, but there are also errors in the year of birth. Jesus' year of birth, according to Ex-Brother's calculation, is Roman Era 753, which is the Gregorian calendar era currently used. However, many scholars believe that Ex-Brother's calculation is four years wrong, and it should be four years before the Gregorian calendar era. But the Gregorian calendar has passed to this year, which is 1948, although it is four years different, it is not easy to correct.</p>
<p>Since the year of Jesus' birth is a problem, then the day of birth is of course even more impossible to determine.</p>
<h3>Chatting about Turkey</h3>
<p>Turkey is a seasonal food for Christmas. The gray feathers, the ochre tassels, the shape is beautiful enough. The tall body and plump muscles also indicate that it has fat and delicious meat for people to enjoy. Therefore, on this once-a-year festival, you must prepare this most abundant and delicious dish.</p>
<p>It is said that the hometown of turkey is in the New World. When European immigrants first arrived in America, there was no warmth, but only severe cold and snow. As soon as the seeds were planted, they were covered with a thick layer of white snow. In this harsh northern winter, the crops were not harvested, and people died of starvation. Fortunately, there were many wild turkeys there for the immigrants who first came to the New World to fill their stomachs, which saved the lives of many people. From then on, every Christmas, eat turkey once to commemorate this difficult day for our ancestors.</p>
<p>The way to eat turkey is recorded in Western recipes. Recently, the US Department of Agriculture found a new species - the Beltsville White Turkey, and made it into a delicious dish for the enjoyment of people all over the world.</p>
<p>The Beltsville White Turkey is a kind of turkey with barely clear fine hairs on its body, and women often regard it as a gift. It matures a month earlier than ordinary turkeys. The body is large and small. Females weigh 8.5 to 9 pounds, and after plucking, they still weigh 7.5 to 8 pounds; that is to say, after plucking, they have not lost much weight. The meat is thick, fat and tender, and the chest is even more beautiful. A sumptuous Christmas banquet is indeed indispensable to this delicious dish.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture's food factory slaughters the Beltsville White Turkey, clears the feathers and internal organs, seals it in a molded pot, adds an appropriate amount of soup, and cooks it with steam. After the cooked chicken is loaded into cages, it is transported to Europe. It is the most beautiful food in canned household bags, and it is Uncle Sam's Christmas gift to Europeans.</p>
<p>One can is just one Beltsville White Turkey; after steaming, put it in a pot, add vegetables on the side, pour two spoons of thick soup, and it becomes a delicious dish. If you like more styles, you can divide the whole chicken into two halves, put half of it in a pot, which is still a main dish in the Christmas dinner, and cut the other half into small pieces, wrap it in thick wax paper, and roast it over the fire, which is a fragrant and beautiful roast chicken.</p>
<p>American families decorate Christmas trees with banknotes, which are used to aid Europe.</p>
<h3>Talking about Christmas Cards</h3>
<p>The tradition of Christmas has been around for 1,500 years, but the use of Christmas cards is only 100 years old. However, in these 100 years, the drawing and printing of Christmas cards has progressed very quickly and has entered the realm of art. The scenery on the card includes snow-covered landscapes, and Santa Claus in white hair and red clothes. Many are the works of famous artists. Its decoration, gold-edged, gold-stamped, and also metal products, is really very exquisite. Today, although Christmas cards are a small gift for communication, they have actually become an interesting work of art.</p>
<p>Many painters have become famous from drawing Christmas cards, such as Kate Greeoaway, Harriett Bennett, Alice Havers, etc. Burlington Printing Company also relies on printing Christmas cards to make its business prosper. Many art groups in the United States make exquisite Christmas cards every year, which are art museums and photography museums with extremely rich artistic value. Handicraft manufacturers also make and sell many Christmas cards as their sideline. Although they are for profit, they do not lose their artistic meaning.</p>
<p>Hall, the solicitation director of the art exhibition, said: "The beautification of Christmas cards has opened up a vast new field for art. In the past, art works were cherished by people, and only a few people had the opportunity to appreciate them. Now, putting art works and Christmas cards together can be appreciated by thousands of people." Indeed, the beautification of Christmas cards has aroused the love of many people. Now, Christmas card collectors have appeared. They cherish all kinds of Christmas cards, which is a grand sight. Compared with the Christmas cards in the book, it is really a small trick.</p>

<h3>After the Revision of the Gold and Silver Storage and Exchange Policy, the Mint Processes and Casts One-Taël and Five-Qián Small Bars, All with a Fineness of Over Ninety-Five Percent</h3>
<p>Rumors that the Central Mint had stopped casting gold bars are entirely untrue. According to the director of the mint, Wei Xianzhang, the rumors of stopping casting are purely speculation from the outside and are completely groundless. The government's gold and silver storage and exchange policy has been revised. Since the 13th of this month, the mint has stopped casting three types of large-denomination gold bars, including ten-taël, five-taël, and three-taël bars, and has been casting one-taël and five-qián small gold bars in their entirety. The mint is currently planning to increase production daily, and resumed night shifts the day before yesterday. The current daily casting quantity has reached over 10,000 bars. Regarding the fineness issue, because the raw materials currently used are those that were previously exchanged, the fineness is inevitably uneven. However, the mint is currently striving to improve it, and the fineness of the bars being cast is all over ninety-five percent.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Rise as Suppliers Ask for Higher Prices; Grain Market Remains Strong, Oil Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Flour prices on the market rose yesterday due to the increase in rice prices on Saturday, which boosted confidence. Suppliers asked for higher prices. Old Brand flour opened at 140 yuan, an increase of 6 yuan compared to before the weekend. Military Ship flour rose slightly by 2 yuan, closing at 129 yuan. Red Peak flour rose by 8 yuan, and Jiancheng flour rose by 6 yuan. Miscellaneous Brand flour rose only slightly because its price was already relatively high. Bran rose by 4-5 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The market was booming and the mood confident. Soybeans rose by 5 yuan, Pinghu broad beans rose by 10 yuan. Sorted Green beans remained sluggish and the price weak. Corn demand was still high, rising by 10-15 yuan. Red sorghum suppliers raised prices, increasing them slightly by 5 yuan. Sesame only had local sales and few transactions. Prices remained firm. Raw peanuts rose by 20-30 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The market was flat and weak. Soybean oil was supplied by factories, but sales were limited to local areas, and the price weakened by 10 yuan. Rong oil was not offered by factories, but exporters were buying it, boosting the market and rising by 10 yuan. Raw oil was stable. Barrel of raw oil was 930 yuan, and small cart sesame oil started at 800 yuan, closing at 840 yuan. Soybean cake oil was bought by merchants, rising by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Sharp Reduction in Production and Exports</p>
<p>It is reported that for the November flour re-export quota, the Ministry of Food still intends to allocate it according to the previous allocation method to adjust the needs of various provinces and cities. Flour mills have already filled out their October production volume. However, due to raw material issues, flour production has decreased, so the number of quotas approved this time will also be reduced.</p>
<h3>This Period's Flour Procurement Reaches 200,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Food Grain Procurement Council Still Entrusts the Farmers Bank to Handle</p>
<p>The Food Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Council, in order to regulate the flour needs of various regions and carry out flat-price distribution, has set a quota of 200,000 bags of flour to be purchased this period, and still entrusted the trust department of the Farmers Bank to make the purchase.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Farmers Bank has signed contracts with various flour mills. According to the production volume of each mill, the four district associations will separately assign purchase quotas, calculate them based on the current market price, and deliver a batch of flour every ten days from the date of the contract, to be delivered in three phases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday was slightly weak, with sparse transactions. Local demand was not strong. Brokers were all reluctant to sell because banks were closing accounts for the end of the year, and payments could not be used on the same day. However, because the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's 36th quotation and allocation was about to be released, the market sentiment was slightly weak, and retail investors frequently sold off. Various grades fell compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>No. 45 Bagged Granulated White Sugar and Dissolved White Sugar were more readily available on the market, and demand was sluggish. Asking prices were small, and each fell by 1-5 yuan. There was not much change in Medium and Coarse Sand sugar. Local sugar from Zhangzhou and green original factory white sugar were the only ones with strong sales, each rising by 10-15 yuan. There were no transactions in the remaining varieties.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gold Control Bureau Investigates the Flow of Idle Capital in the Market</h3>
<p>A General Inspection Will Be Implemented Soon</p>
<p>The current gold control policy will have some revisions, and the Ministry of Finance is currently drafting the revision methods. Once the new cabinet is formed, it will be submitted for discussion to complete the legislative procedures. Its basic spirit will take the articles stipulated in the Banking Law as the principle, focusing on diverting idle capital and transferring it to productive uses. Since Bi Delin took over the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, all work has continued as usual. The current central task of the bureau is to investigate the flow of idle capital and the lending and borrowing business of banks and financial institutions. It is heard that a general inspection of financial institutions in the entire city will be implemented in the near future.</p>
<h3>Simplified Procedures for Overseas Chinese Investment in Domestic Enterprises</h3>
<p>According to the Export-Import Management Commission, since the commencement of overseas Chinese investment in domestic production enterprises, it has generally been considered that the restrictions are too strict, so applicants are not very enthusiastic. In view of this, the Export-Import Management Commission has not only simplified the original application procedures, but also suggested to the Executive Yuan that the types of imported materials stipulated in the original annex to the regulations be relaxed. In the future, imported materials can also include those listed in Annexes (1), (2), and (3)A of the Export-Import Trade Regulations.</p>
<h3>Simplified Structure of Export-Import Management</h3>
<p>The Export Trade Management Regulations have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan for several days. It is now learned that the Export-Import Management Commission has formally received a clear order of approval from the Executive Yuan, and the Commission has decided that once the work of simplifying the structure and adjusting personnel is completed, it can be formally implemented. Before the reorganization is completed, all import and export management will still be handled in accordance with past methods.</p>
<h3>Export Trade Focus Gradually Reveals Signs of Shifting South</h3>
<p>According to information from the Export Control Board: foreign exchange transfer certificates have been steadily rising this week (excluding December 13th to 18th). The export volume of this city is quite enthusiastic. The total value of foreign exchange settlement applications last week exceeded 7 million US dollars, which is unprecedented. However, goods arriving in various places are mostly stagnant. Even pig bristles, casings, feathers, and fur, which are currently in peak season, are scarce. It is rumored that a large number of materials from the southwest are now exported via Guangzhou, and the focus of export trade is gradually showing signs of shifting south.</p>
<p>As for the overseas market prices of our major export commodities, they are generally stable. According to a telegram received from London on Monday, Chongqing No. 27 Mixed Bristles are priced at 21 shillings per pound, Tianjin No. 55 Short Bristles at 50 shillings per pound, and Tianjin No. 26 Short Bristles at 40 shillings per pound. In addition, the feather market is strong, with grey duck feathers and white goose feathers priced at US$0.39 and US$0.59 per pound FOB, respectively.</p>
<h3>Woolen Textile Industry Faces Crisis</h3>
<p>The woolen textile industry was once extremely prosperous, but the current situation has undergone a major change, and the industry has fallen into a difficult situation. According to people in the industry, the cost of the industry is too high, and selling its products at market prices would result in a loss of 20%. Moreover, due to transportation issues, internal transport is very difficult, and even if it arrives, there are few takers, so sales are very sluggish. Under these circumstances, the industry is extremely anxious, and it is difficult to maintain the current situation, so they have been reducing work. Many of the import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons of the industry cannot be raised and settled.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Transactions Sporadic</h3>
<p>Due to various environmental factors, combined with the discount rate being lower than the interest rate of the exchange, and at the same time, since the price limit was lifted, compared with various commodity prices, the multiple of its increase is the smallest, and there is a high probability of falling again and not falling. As for actual business, there are still few wholesale transactions, and customers have successively stopped. Except for a few of the shops on this street, most of the shops are deserted for a while, resulting in only sporadic transactions and a lack of large-scale trading. At present, most stores adhere to the policy of selling before replenishing, and do not want to add inventory if there are no sales.</p>
<h3>Silk Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of rayon was quoted off-exchange, and the market was closed for the day, with no transactions, but people's minds were still stable, and transactions were rare.</p>
<p>The interbank forward price for 120 grade Tianqiao was quoted at 15,000 yuan, and Dongyang at 15,200 yuan. Other prices were quoted slightly higher by 200 to 300 yuan. The market was ostensibly up but actually flat.</p>
<p>The raw silk market was sluggish yesterday. Silver and money shops were closed, foreign firms did not quote prices, there were no reports of export transactions, and there were only a few sporadic transactions among domestic traders. The interbank forward price for Grade D 78 uniformity was quoted at 17,300 yuan, and premium spot goods at 16,800 yuan. The market was uneventful, with minimal fluctuations.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was also quiet yesterday. Some retail investors sold off-exchange, and the market was slightly lower than on Saturday by 300 to 500 yuan. Meiya bed covers were quoted at 10,000 yuan, and Huaqiang at 9,800 yuan.</p>
<p>Most Silk Factories Still Profitable</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Silk Reeling Industry Association: Although the silk industry this year is not as good as last year, if it is operated prudently, it should not be a loss, and there is still a small profit to be made. If one relies on speculation or debt financing, then there will undoubtedly be a loss. Because the current fuel and wages are still stable, the Shanghai price is about 20,000 yuan per picul. If calculated according to net cost, there is still a profit of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea House Trading Begins, Cotton Cloth Initially Firm then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was closed for the day as usual due to the year-end interest settlement by banks. However, some trading took place at the Paradise Tea House. Four Gentlemen Yuan Piaoji initially traded 20 pieces at 496 yuan, and then rose to a maximum of 498 yuan, with a small amount of trading. Finally, selling pressure increased, and the price fell to 483 yuan. Dragon Head Fine Cloth was offered at 480 yuan, but there were even fewer transactions. The cloth stores' door sales were sluggish, and people's minds were unsettled. At the tea house, the colored corduroy cloth produced by private cloth factories had some transactions.</p>
<p>China Textile Corporation Suspends Allocation</p>
<p>Yesterday, all markets declared closed. The China Textile Corporation also suspended allocation for one day due to difficulties in delivery, and will resume as usual today.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Mediocre</h3>
<p>Daily necessities were greatly affected by the closing of the market yesterday, and transactions were extremely mediocre. Cigarettes were priced flat and lacked the strength to rebound. Gu Ben closed at 303 yuan, scissors soap at 290 yuan, 120 Yellow Xiangmao at 245 yuan, Beautiful Matches rose slightly, closing at 1,550 yuan, Phoenix Matches at 1,500 yuan, and miscellaneous brands had little trading.</p>
<h3>Decline of the Hankou Casing Industry</h3>
<p>Hoping for Government Loans and Tax-Free Salt Allocation</p>
<p>[Hankou Correspondence] According to a casing exporter in Hankou, the current casing export business is on the verge of its final demise. If the government does not take measures to save it, it will soon decline. Major casing factories in Hankou, such as Dechang, Fuxing, Chonglin, and Sanhe, are all reducing casing exports and shrinking their business scope. Taking Dechang as an example, before the war, it exported more than 200 barrels of casings per month (including the Chongqing factory) (an average of 600 pieces per barrel, totaling 2,500 pairs), but now it has been reduced to about 20 barrels. In the past, casing sales were mainly in Germany and France, and could also be sold in the UK, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal. After World War II, the UK banned the import of casings, and the people of other countries suffered hardships, resulting in a sharp decline in sales. Because the international casing market price is low, domestic casing factories dare not buy at high prices. Before the war, each pair of casings was about 3 French francs, but now it can only be bought in at 4 gold yuan per pair, and the price has fallen by about three times. The source of casings, in addition to Hankou itself, mostly relies on the countryside. At present, meat merchants in various places are not profitable, and most sell casings along with pork. In addition, the bandit areas have expanded, making it inconvenient for casing merchants to transport, and it is not easy to purchase. In addition to transportation and factory payments, refined salt expenses are an important item. Each barrel of casings requires 200 jin of refined salt. Major salt shops in Hankou are hampered by various difficulties and cannot sell in large quantities at lower prices. They have no choice but to seek it from the retail market at high prices, which increases the cost of making casings. In the past, each casing factory has done its best to use domestic unimportant materials (casings) to earn a large amount of foreign exchange for the government, which is beneficial to balancing international payments. Now facing a crisis, they still stick to their posts and try to struggle, hoping that the government, in line with the purpose of encouraging export business, will immediately provide support to each casing factory. On the one hand, implement low-interest loans, and on the other hand, allocate tax-free salt (Shanghai has a precedent), and provide convenience in transportation, in order to save the critical fate.</p>
<h3>Import Quotas for the Seventh and Eighth Seasons Can be Applied for in Other Ports</h3>
<p>According to information from the Export Control Board: The import quotas for the seventh and eighth seasons have already been fully allocated. As for the industrial quotas, because the manufacturing industries have not yet agreed on the allocation, they have been submitted to the Import Quota Department for allocation. It is reported that more than 200 import quota cases approved by the quota allocation office have been issued import licenses by the visa office, but all applicants have not gone to collect them, which is the opposite of the past situation. It is said that this is due to waiting and seeing. However, according to the responsible authorities, if the applicants do not want to import in Shanghai, they can go through transit procedures at the visa office and import in other ports.</p>
<h3>Timber Arrivals Still Scarce</h3>
<p>The timber market situation, during the bank closing and interest settlement period, trading was as usual. It is expected that various non-industry items may be seen higher after the opening, so traders are unwilling to depreciate prices. Fir strips are priced at 1.4 yuan and 1.3 yuan, and sales are quite good. The rumor that the cigarette factory is resuming work is rife, and there is also absorption in the tea house. The remaining goods are considered stable. However, arrivals are still scarce, presumably due to the impact of the situation, traders dare not purchase large quantities from the producing areas.</p>

<h3>Fujian Timber Faces Crisis, Still a Glimmer of Hope</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Chen Xiaofeng</p>
<p>[Our Xiamen dispatch, 17th] The economic lifeline of Fujian Province is based on the income from overseas remittances in southern Fujian, and the export of special products in northern Fujian. In addition to tea, daffodils, oranges, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms, timber is the main export product of Fujian Province, most of which are inhaled and exhaled from Fuzhou. It not only maintains the lives of hundreds of thousands of carpenters in the vast area of Jianbei, but also supports the prosperity of the Fuzhou market.</p>
<p>Good Times Don't Last</p>
<p>But good times don't last. Currently, most of China is mired in the flames of war, and Tianjin and Shanghai, which are the largest markets for Fujian timber, have stopped all construction due to the war. Therefore, the route for Fujian timber has been cut off, and the export situation has fallen into an unprecedented predicament. Fuzhou, which has always been known as a timber distribution center, has 190 timber firms to date, all of which have been forced to stop. More than 90 of them are in a state of complete stagnation. In addition, more than 140 sawmills are also facing the same crisis and have closed down, directly affecting the lives of tens of thousands of workers who rely on sawmills for a living. This is indeed a serious problem in Fujian Province at present.</p>
<p>Workers' Lives</p>
<p>According to people with economic vision: The sluggish sales of timber are a harbinger of the economic crisis in Fujian Province. Jianbei produces a lot of timber every year. In addition to timber merchants who specialize in this business, there are no less than hundreds of thousands of carpenters who are responsible for clearing mountains, peeling, sawing barrels, dragging fences, releasing streams, and nailing picks. Timber farmers are not included. Once all timber sales are stopped, how will the lives of these hundreds of thousands of workers be solved? It seems difficult to avoid rural bankruptcy, and its impact on the social economy is even greater. At this time, the public security in Jianbei will face an unpredictable situation, which will obviously form a social and economic problem.</p>
<p>Stagnant Exports</p>
<p>The stagnation of timber is affected by the recent war in the north. In the past, the first target of exports of Fujian timber was Shanghai, followed by Tianjin, and then distributed to Niuzhuang, Yantai and other places, followed by Ningbo, Nantong, Taiwan and southern Fujian. In addition to general needs, mining used the most. However, today, "the war has affected mining work in the north, reducing demand, and it goes without saying for others, which has given Fujian timber a major blow.</p>
<p>Areas in the province that use Fuzhou timber are mostly Fuqing, Putian, Quanzhou and other places along the coast. In the past, because overseas remittances in southern Fujian were smooth, overseas Chinese areas were building on a large scale, and sales were quite good. Recently, due to the lack of overseas remittances, it has also been affected, but the number of sales is limited after all, so the price of timber in Fuzhou has plummeted. According to the current situation: timber is not as good as firewood. Firewood is priced at more than 20 yuan per dan, but timber must be worth about 12 yuan per tube, weighing about 120 jin, and then processed and sawn into firewood pieces to get more than double the price. In addition to wages, the price of the timber itself is completely lost, so timber merchants are unwilling to engage in this business again, and have changed their careers or quietly returned north. The Fuzhou market has also become depressed as a result. Recently, the business of Nantai KTV restaurants has been sluggish, which is very different from the golden age of soaring timber prices in August and September this year. It was only a short time ago, and the difference is like heaven and earth, which is unbearable to look back on.</p>
<p>Opening Up the Market</p>
<p>In the future, Taiwan will be a major sales market for timber. In the past, Taiwan did not need this kind of thick timber from Fujian because it built Japanese-style houses, so there was a saying that "good timber does not go to Taiwan". However, recently, a large number of people from Beijing and Shanghai have moved to Taiwan, and Taiwan is building on a large scale, and needs timber everywhere. Therefore, some Fuzhou timber merchants have gone to Taiwan to seek sales channels. In order to solve this serious problem, the Fujian Provincial Government also sent Chen Huazhou, a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee, to Taiwan on the 12th to discuss opening up the timber market. If successful, this is a glimmer of hope in the face of the crisis in Fujian timber. However, according to people engaged in this business, the current difficulty in the transportation of timber in this province is still the means of transportation. If this problem can be solved, Fujian timber still has great potential in Taiwan, and the crisis can be eliminated.</p>

<h3>Message from Hainan: A Letter from Fortress Commander Nie Qi to the Elders</h3>
<p>— Xi Wen</p>
<p>[Our Jiayin dispatch, 19th] Nie Qi, former chief of staff of the Fortress Command, was transferred to the position of Hainan Island Fortress Commander in October of this year, and arrived in Yulin on November 3 to take over. He recently sent a letter to the elders of this county, reporting in detail on the current situation of the island. Here are the main points: Hainan Island is the southernmost end of China, located between 19 degrees and 9 minutes to 20 degrees and 7 minutes north latitude, and 108 degrees and 36 minutes to 111 degrees and 3 minutes east longitude. It is an oval-shaped island composed of the northeast Ganwei archipelago and the surrounding water islands, facing Tokyo and Taiwan from afar. It controls the Nanyang archipelago to the south, faces the Philippines to the east, and is separated from the Leizhou Peninsula by the Lei-Qiong Strait to the north. It is a strategic hub in the southwest Pacific. The island covers an area of about 97,198 square miles, and looking forward to Taiwan, which is 600 nautical miles away, is no less than the two eyes of the Republic of China, guarding the national defense sea frontier. It is indeed the most important part of the national defense economy.</p>
<p>Haikou Port is located at the northern end of the island and is the</p>
<p>Commercial Center</p>
<p>The humanities and philosophy are no less than those of inland cities. Qiu Gong Wen Zhuang and Hai Gong Zhongjie of the Ming Dynasty were born here, which is enough to add color to the island. Yulin Port is located at the southernmost end of the island and is the most important naval and air force base for national defense and military affairs. It is also the only base for controlling the South Pacific. It is remembered that during the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese enemy began to occupy the island, President Chiang Kai-shek made a statement to Chinese and foreign reporters, specially emphasizing that it was the "September 18 Incident" on the Pacific, and the importance of its position can be imagined. Jinlin Port is also a natural good military port. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian fleet once docked here. The current naval wharf in the port has been painstakingly built by the Japanese for many years. The water is deep and the port is wide, and it can berth battleships of more than 10,000 tons. Moreover, it is surrounded by mountains and water, and the terrain is majestic. There is no fear of hurricane attacks, and it is especially good for its beautiful scenery. It is truly a good port.</p>
<p>Qiong Island not only has</p>
<p>Natural seaports and large air force bases, but also a virgin land yet to be developed. The island is rich in mineral deposits. The Shilu iron ore in western Qiong and the Tiandu mine in Yulin in southern Qiong are the best in the world. The Hainan Iron Mine Bureau is now engaged in new mining methods, and the daily mining of ore sand is considerable, symbolizing the gratifying prospects of Chinese industry. The reserves of fishery and aquatic products are also the largest fishery station in South China. The Guangdong branch of the Fishery Administration is located in Yulin and is engaged in the development of fisheries. The salt pans in Yanya in southern Qiong and Changgan and Yinggehai in western Qiong are the largest in scale. The Japanese originally intended to create the second largest blue field in the world to supply their South Pacific and domestic military and civilian needs, but only completed one-tenth or two-tenths of the project, and the Japanese Kou announced their unconditional surrender. In the future, if the leadership can catch up quickly, on the one hand, use military force to wipe out scattered bandits, and on the other hand, engage in construction work, then the country and the people will benefit, and the future is limitless. In addition, there are coconuts, betel nuts, and jackfruits, etc.</p>
<p>Tropical Products</p>
<p>Which are not available in our inland China. It is also the only rubber producing area in our country, so in terms of national defense resources, it is indeed an important arsenal. In the past, the Japanese painstakingly built and various development and construction projects were somewhat based, but after the restoration, banditry spread, and development work could not be carried out. However, the government still kept the construction of Qiong Island in mind, and that is why. The climate of Qiong Island belongs to the sub-band, although it is close to the equator, it is not very hot due to the regulation of the Pacific sea breeze. Plants are suitable for growth, and it has the reputation of "summer is always summer, and autumn is formed after a rain". The islanders live honestly and simply, have the habit of being hardworking and enduring, and are especially full of awe-inspiring righteousness. The Li people in the hinterland live scattered in the deep mountains and wilderness, still living a primitive life, which is inherently in need of the authorities to actively carry out educational work. At present, the public security in Yanya in southern Qiong is still good. However, due to</p>
<p>Vast Defense Area</p>
<p>And a thin military force, bandits still harass from time to time, and I will uphold the revolutionary spirit, the duty of soldiers to protect the country and the people, and follow the instructions of the leadership to ensure public security, consolidate southern Qiong, seize the opportunity, and quell banditry, in order to relieve the government's southern concerns and to live up to the expectations of the people.</p>
<p>Recently, the flames of war have engulfed the earth. Since being transferred to Hainan, I have been 10,000 miles away. Every time I read the newspaper, I know the danger of the Huai River and feel the threat of the Jiangnan. I have never failed to</p>
<p>Across the River</p>
<p>The elders and brothers feel the wind and rain. The ancients said: "Born in adversity, die in ease and pleasure", and said: "Loyal ministers and illegitimate sons are worried about their hearts and think deeply", so the autumn of hardship and suspicion is a great opportunity for us to succeed and establish our careers. I hope that the elders of Jiangyin will uphold the spirit of cooperation between the military and the civilians in the past, and under the leadership of Commander Dai, rise up together to block the enemy in Jiangbei and eliminate banditry in the invisible. This is what I, the elders and brothers, expect day and night.</p>
<h3>A Shell Falls in Bangbu, Affecting Workers</h3>
<p>[Our Zhazha Prefecture, 16th] A shocking tragedy suddenly occurred on Huada Street in this city. It turned out that at about 4:00 pm on the 16th, a twin-engine transport plane flew over the urban area when the engine suddenly failed, causing a box of bullets loaded for air delivery to fall from the plane and land on Huada Street. It happened that a city party department worker passed by Hongru Bank and was bombed to death. At that time, the flesh and blood were blurred, and the extremity was miserable. When the city party department heard the news, it ordered someone to carry the body to his home for burial. The person in charge of the party department has asked the garrison command to order the air force station to give preferential treatment to the bereaved. The agricultural reclamation office assists in the drainage project</p>
<h3>The Decline of Jiangxi Porcelain Industry: Provincial Government Proposes Establishing a National Kiln</h3>
<p>Agricultural Reclamation Office to Assist with Drainage Projects</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuyuan, 15th of this month] The local porcelain industry is suffering as raw material and labor costs continue to rise each month. Porcelain prices have increased more than tenfold compared to before August 19th, resulting in little difference between production costs and sales prices. Winter sales in various regions have been sluggish for the past month. Currently, only about 20% of porcelain kilns are operating. In light of the decline of Jingdezhen porcelain, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has decided to establish a large-scale, modern kiln factory in Jingdezhen in the near future. It also proposes that the central government establish a national kiln to actively promote overseas trade. At the same time, funds will be allocated to expand the existing porcelain factories in Pingxiang and Jiujiang, enabling the porcelain industries in the three locations to develop together.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Committee recognizes Poyang Lake as the largest lake in central China's Yangtze River region. The lakeside terrain is low-lying, and to prevent floods and droughts and actively promote mechanized reclamation, it has been decided in consultation with the Jiangxi Provincial Government that the office will provide a large number of pumps and other machinery to assist in drainage projects in the lakeside areas.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] This county lacks grain, and in the past, it relied heavily on rice from Jiangxi. Now, the situation is reversed. Large quantities of rice from the southwest of the county are being transported for sale in Jingdezhen and Leping, leading to a depletion of reserves and severe food shortages in the northeast villages. The local authorities are currently taking measures to prevent this, including prohibiting the transportation of grain out of the county.</p>
<p>To prevent scattered bandits from Dexing, Kunshan, and the Wuyuan area from fleeing into the county, the county government has dispatched a self-defense squad to the Jiangwan and Duanshen areas in eastern Wuyuan to assist in the suppression efforts.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Business Corps to Be Established</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 19th of this month] The County Chamber of Commerce has decided to re-establish the Business Corps. It has already recruited 120 members, and the uniforms will be provided by the Chamber of Commerce. The corps will be established soon and will recruit more members to protect businesses and maintain public order.</p>
<h3>A Ruthless Analysis of the Pioneers in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>— Liu Peiheng</p>
<p>[Air Dispatch from Dihua, 16th of this month] When I first arrived in Xinjiang, I was particularly struck by the group of Han Chinese, the so-called pioneers of the frontier, even more so than by the Uyghurs with their typically Western high-bridged noses. Several phenomena, more corrupt than in the interior by several degrees, caused me pain, sorrow, and even a sense of despair. In my previous dispatches to newspapers in the interior, I had occasionally mentioned the living conditions of our Han Chinese compatriots in Xinjiang, but they were too brief and disorganized to leave a lasting impression. Therefore, I am now providing a more systematic report for readers who are concerned about the frontier regions.</p>
<p>Increase in the Han Chinese Population</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of Han Chinese migrating here has increased steadily, making previous statistics unreliable. According to a survey conducted by Professor Chen Chengzhi of Xida University up to 1946, there were 202,239 people. However, the current number is likely approaching 300,000. These Han Chinese live primarily in the areas centered around Dihua, distributed throughout northern Xinjiang in Qitai, Suilai, Hugangbi, and Zhenxi, with a small number also in Hami in eastern Xinjiang. In southern Xinjiang, except for a few major cities, there are hardly any Han Chinese. Among these Han Chinese compatriots, the largest group is merchants, followed by military and government personnel, and then a portion who are overseas Chinese returning from the Soviet Union. Most of the merchants migrated to Xinjiang during the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. Some came to Xinjiang for political or military service and later changed occupations, while others came from Tianjin and Shandong to seek gold. Having lived in Xinjiang for a long time and established families, they have settled down, partly due to the inconvenience of transportation and partly because Xinjiang is a virgin land waiting to be developed, where all kinds of businesses are easier to develop than in the interior, and where doing business is particularly profitable. As a result, they have registered as residents and become quasi-Xinjiang people. These Han Chinese have a much better environment than the native people of Xinjiang and wield economic power, so they often regard themselves as an "elite" ethnicity and become the darlings of Xinjiang. However, these darlings have also been taught a lesson. During the Yining Incident in 1944, many Han Chinese in the Yining, Tacheng, and Altai regions were killed, and those who fled after the peace treaty was signed were all bankrupt. During the most critical moments of the 1941 incident, Han Chinese in Dihua and the northern areas fled to the interior en masse. It was not until the signing of the peace treaty that they calmed their fears and gradually returned to Xinjiang.</p>
<p>After this lesson, one would expect the Han Chinese to have a new understanding of the frontier issues and to be more vigilant psychologically. However, this is not the case. Especially in recent years, waves of high-ranking military and government officials and so-called "pioneers of the frontier" have come west, bringing with them all the corrupt practices of the interior. The convergence of the "two Hans" means that everything found in the interior is now also in Xinjiang. Gluttony, bribery, drug use, smuggling, eating, drinking, prostitution, gambling—nothing is inferior to the interior, especially in Dihua, the nerve center of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Inharmonious Phenomena</p>
<p>People living in the interior generally assume that Xinjiang has a special environment and that social phenomena must also be somewhat different, but this is not the case at all. The things you cannot stand in the interior can all be found here. In the interior, are personnel problems such as "factionalism" and "infighting" not common? Here, it is not limited to personnel matters, but also involves "political" and "ethnic" issues. Despite the lack of talent in Xinjiang, the phenomenon of overstaffing has not diminished. In Dihua, I have a friend who is a mid-level official in a certain agency. I see that he is already idle enough all day long, but the agency he works for is still recruiting staff. I asked him, "Why are you still hiring people?" He said that they are still far from reaching the authorized staffing level. This has created an inharmonious phenomenon in Xinjiang, a kind of deformed development!</p>
<p>Appalling Social Atmosphere</p>
<p>In Xinjiang, I feel that the Han Chinese friends I have met are wealthier than those in the interior. Even a very low-level civil servant or a humble military officer will spend money like water. Their generosity makes me feel ashamed. I seem so stingy and unworldly. "Where do they get so much money?" This remains a question. Is it from corruption? Perhaps some, but I am sure that this is not entirely the case, because I know that many people are indeed very poor. Why is a poor young man so indifferent? Perhaps it is the social atmosphere! However, what you find most unbearable are those fat merchants and some high-ranking officials. Their corrupt appearance will truly surprise you. Of course, there is no shortage of wise people among the high-ranking officials who care about and understand the frontier, but they are too few. The vast majority are focused on how to "get promoted," "get rich," and "find women" (especially "find second wives"). You can see their shadows in dance halls and luxury hotels, places where it is easiest to spend money. In Dihua, a mid-level military officer told me that if a military officer in Dihua does not know how to dance, it is considered the biggest defect. As for gambling, Han Chinese in Xinjiang have more gambling equipment than in the interior. The wealthy play mahjong or poker, while the lower classes squat at the base of the city walls to roll dice or bet on numbers. Even the soldiers guarding the city are playing cards under the city tower. I stayed in a very small county for a few days and saw the way the Han Chinese there gamble, and it was truly shocking. Merchants, soldiers, and civil servants gather together to gamble every day. They spend most of their days on this, and everything else seems to be irrelevant to them!</p>
<p>Hoping for More Effort</p>
<p>Before I came to Xinjiang, I thought that the Han Chinese in Xinjiang would have a deeper understanding of the "Xinjiang problem" than people in the interior, because living in such a complex "ethnic" and "political" region would foster a complex mindset due to the complex environment. However, I was completely wrong. The Han Chinese merchants in Xinjiang are no different from the unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai. They are adept at "hoarding," "profiteering," and "creating black markets," even more daring than the merchants in Shanghai, because there is no stimulation of war here, and little criticism from public opinion. The authorities sometimes do not even dare to swat a fly. This is truly sad.</p>
<p>I love Xinjiang, so I am particularly struck by the pioneers of Xinjiang. Perhaps my words are a bit harsh, but the purity of my heart and the urgency of my expectations should be self-evident. I hope that the young people of Xinjiang will make more efforts!</p>

<h3>Chengyou Wins Main Game of the Morning Friend Cup, 44-37 Reversal</h3>
<p>[News from this Newspaper] In the decisive battle of the Morning Friend Cup Basketball Tournament last night, Chengyou defeated Renyu 44-37, reversing the defeat. In the first half, Renyu led Chengyou by one point, 17-16. There were over a thousand spectators at the Municipal Gymnasium, and the atmosphere was quite lively. In the first half, Chengyou's shooting and free throws were too unreliable, missing many good opportunities. In the second half, they gradually improved. After six ties, Chengyou finally reversed the defeat with a score of 44-37, creating a record of eight wins in eight games. There is still one game left against Jianle, and if they win, the championship will be no problem. In another Group A game, Peier defeated Lehe 50-42, and in Group B, Shanhei defeated Xinxin 49-21.</p>
<p>Renyu Fights Hard, Takes One-Point Lead</p>
<p>In the key game between Chengyou and Renyu, the referees were Liu Hesheng and Zheng Zhifang. Renyu had momentum, but missed two shots. Chengyou countered, with He Zeng and Fu Qixia making free throws, scoring three consecutive points. Renyu's Wu Xinyun and Li Zhaohe followed suit, returning three points. Soon, Xinyun added another basket, and with two consecutive free throws, Renyu gradually took the lead at 7-3. Wang Rongsheng and Liang Rongbiao followed closely, making it 7-6. Chengyou called a timeout. He Zeng tied the score at 7-7, and Wang Huaiding added a point for Renyu. Chengyou called another timeout, with the score at 15-12. Wang Bingfu made a shot. When the opponent's Xinyun scored again, Renyu led by five points, making it 15-10. Chengyou panicked and called a third timeout, with the score at 15-12. He Zeng and Wang Bingfu made two free throws, and Liang Rongbiao scored, making it 16-15. Xinyun scored another basket, and Renyu still led by 17-16, with a narrow one-point lead.</p>
<p>Six Ties, Chengyou Takes the Lead</p>
<p>In the second half, Renyu's Wang Huaiding immediately scored a basket. Wang Rongsheng and He Zeng tied the score at 19-19, and then again at 21-21 and 23-23, for a total of six ties. Bingfu and He Zeng scored three consecutive times, making it 29-23. Rongsheng was ejected for committing five fouls and replaced by Shi Jiuquan. Xinyun and Bingfu competed fiercely, making it 33-26. Chengyou's score continued to rise from there. Shen Pengju replaced Li Zhaohe. Soon, Xinyun committed five fouls, and Zhaohe re-entered. In the last ten minutes, Renyu's momentum was exhausted. The score was 38-27. Sun Moses replaced Liang Rongbiao, making it 40-27. He Zeng committed five fouls, and Ji Youkun entered the game. With only five minutes remaining, the opponent's two strong players left the game one after another, which was a good opportunity for Renyu. However, the score difference was too great to make a difference. Chengyou won against Renyu with a score of 44-37.</p>

<h3>Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Zhongguo Huang and Zhejiang Xing Lead the Pack</h3>
<p>Recent Developments in the Finals</p>
<p>The second Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament has already started the finals. Except for the Chunmao team, which has withdrawn, the six strongest teams, including Zhongguo Huang, Shanghai, Citibank (Silver Group), Zhejiang Xing (Coin Group), Siming, and Jiaotong (Industry Group), will compete in a single round-robin to determine the final rankings. Currently, the Zhongguo Huang and Zhejiang Xing teams are considered the best, each leading the pack with three wins in three matches. Siming, the third-place finisher from the previous tournament, is closely following behind, maintaining an unbeaten record with two wins in two matches. The Shanghai team has emerged as a dark horse in this tournament. Players such as Ling Kecheng, Chen Quan, and Yang Yongkang are physically strong and have plenty of stamina. Under the guidance of coach Mei, they have defeated the strong Citibank team twice, which is an amazing feat. They only have one match left against Jiaotong, and they are likely to win, securing fourth place without any problems. The recent standings of the six strongest teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Team Name | Played | Won | Lost</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Zhongguo Huang | 3 | 3 | 0</p>
<p>Zhejiang Xing | 3 | 3 | 0</p>
<p>Siming | 2 | 2 | 0</p>

<p>The Municipal Sports Association Football Committee announced yesterday the football schedule for this week. There will be a total of nine league matches for Groups A, B, and C on Saturday (25th) and Sunday (26th), as well as a winter relief charity match. The schedule is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>December 25th (Saturday) Qingbai vs. Railway (Group A) 2:30 p.m. Yiyuan</p>
<p>December 26th (Sunday)</p>
<p>Hualian vs. Xilian (Winter) (Charity) 2:30 p.m. Yiyuan</p>
<p>Qunli vs. Zhichao (Group A) 9:00 a.m. Yiyuan</p>
<p>Youji vs. Yong'an (Group C2) 9:00 a.m. Zhongyi</p>
<p>Gongjiao vs. Youai (Group C3) 9:00 a.m. Zhongyi</p>
<p>Hongying vs. Gonghexing (Group C1) 9:00 a.m. Zhongsan</p>
<p>Xin Shenghe vs. Jizhi (Group C1) 10:30 a.m. Zhongyi</p>
<p>Fangjian vs. Zhonghang B (Group C2) 10:30 a.m. Zhonger</p>
<p>Baoxing vs. Pan Team (Group B) 2:30 p.m. Zhongyi</p>
<p>Longtou B vs. Huzhong (Group C3) 2:30 p.m. Zhonger</p>
<p>The Qingbai vs. Railway match on Saturday was originally scheduled for the previous week (5th), but was postponed due to rain. Both teams in Group A have maintained an unbeaten record with six wins in six matches, forming a standoff. This match is the decisive battle of the first round in Group A. Qingbai, the leader of the football scene, cherishes its reputation, while the Railway generals are ambitious to replace it. The meeting of the two winning teams will inevitably lead to a fierce battle, and the outcome of this match will reveal who will ultimately prevail.</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on Sunday, Qunli will face Zhichao, which is the last match of the first round in Group A. The two teams are evenly matched and should be worth watching. At 2:30 p.m., the Winter Relief Charity Match was initiated by Mayor Wu and organized by the Football Committee. Hualian will face Xilian. The lineups of the two teams are currently being selected and organized separately by the Football Committee and the Western Sports Association of the Racecourse. It is hoped that they will be produced and announced soon. A gathering of famous Chinese and Western players in one match, competing for victory, will surely satisfy the eyes of the city's football fans with its excitement and tension.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Sports Association Achieves Unity: New Board Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>[Air Dispatch from Hong Kong] After the Hong Kong Sports Association branch's re-election experienced twists and turns, the first board meeting after unity was held on the evening of the 9th at the Jiasan South China Stadium. Cai Huihong, Zhong Zhiqiang, Ye Jiugao, Pan Yongkai, Zeng Jingkang, Lin Zhonghao, Yang Rong, Hu Zujian, Mo Yinghuai, Shi Puhui, Lai Duanfu, Lai Rurong, He Jingbo, Li Yuda, Liao Yankai, Zhang Jintian, Huang Shaoxiong, and Zhang Hualun attended. Cai Huisheng presided over the meeting. The meeting began with a report by Cai Huihong. Zhong Zhiqiang continued to read out the list of directors that each association had sent to the association and recognized as attending the association. The list is as follows: Xingdao: Cai Huihong, Li Hangan; Nanhua: He Jingbo, Mo Qing (resigned, replacement pending); Guanghua: Zhang Hanwei, Liao Yankai; Zhongsheng: Mo Qingwei, Li Xianliang; Jiezhi: Song Zixian, Zhao Qiwen; Football Association: Zeng Jingkang, Feng Shaokang; Small Ball Club: Lai Rurong, Zhang Hualun; Zhonghua: Ye Jiugao, Li Yuda; Bus: Yang Rong, Lei Jinhua; Taikoo: Lin Zhonghao, Zhang Hanqi; Zhonghua Amusement Club: Li Junjie.</p>
<p>After reading out the list of directors from each association, the first item passed was the approval of the new officers elected on November 10. The following is the full list of key officers of the association:</p>
<p>Chairman Cai Huihong, Vice Chairman Pan Yongkai, Secretary-General Zhong Zhiqiang, Treasurer Mo Qingwei. Football Director Ye Jiugao, Basketball Director Shi Zhenda, Volleyball Director He Jingbo, Baseball Director Li Yuda, Track and Field Director Lin Zhonghao, Swimming Director Huang Shaoxiong, Martial Arts Director Yang Rong, Small Ball Director Zeng Jingkang, Table Tennis Director Lai Rurong, Billiards Director Li Xianliang, Badminton Director Li Junjie, Boxing Director Hu Zujian.</p>
<p>During the ratification, Zhong Zhiqiang firmly offered his resignation, but everyone felt that even if he wanted to resign, he should postpone it until the next board meeting. Zhong Zhiqiang postponed this decision. The second item was the election of standing directors. There are supposed to be seven standing directors, but the chairman, vice chairman, secretary-general, and treasurer are ex officio, so three more were elected to complete the number. The three elected were Ye Jiugao and Lin Zhonghao. The third item raised by someone in attendance was about the previous decision by the association for Cai Huihong, Mo Yinghuai, and He Jingbo to be responsible. It was now decided to expedite this process and these three committee members would work with the directors of the Zhonghua Amusement Club attending the association to handle the matter jointly. Fourth, Mo Yingwei proposed that since the directors of each department had been elected, the responsible persons should organize at least one successful event each year.</p>
<p>Arranging the Lineup for the Governor's Cup</p>
<p>In addition, there are two other issues that need to be resolved. One is the new membership. The Table Tennis Federation wants Yu to join and is leaving it to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors to review and approve. As for the issue of the association's address, Cai Huihong felt that it was not easy to find one at the moment and decided to first seek the consent of the following four associations: Nanhua Association, Liaosheng Society, Youth Association, and Zhonghua Amusement Club, and choose one of them as a temporary address.</p>
<p>Finally, it was decided that the Governor's Cup would begin its first battle this Sunday at the Flower Market. The Western Union team's lineup has already been selected by the General Association. The Association decided to have the standing directors hold an ad hoc meeting to select officials in consultation with people involved in football. Everyone felt that victory was essential in the first battle and decided to select the strongest lineup to play and also decided to send a letter to the General Association requesting 30 tickets for the match that day for the directors to enter the venue.</p>
