<h3 id="c29">新聞自由的道德基礎　聯合國新聞自由會議開幕 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>聯合國新聞自由會議，今天在「世界公國」的日內瓦開幕了，世界各國的名記者政論家暨政府代表五六百人，聚首一堂，將從長討論新聞自由的理論與實際，並將制定國際新聞自由憲章，爲各國報界共同遵循的法典。此一會議，在世界新聞史上，誠爲空前未有之國際會議，且攸關我們新聞工作者本身的　　和續益，自然格外値得我們重視。茲當開幕之際，我們站在報業的立塲，不能不略抒所見，以供與會各國代表的參考。</p>
<p>國際新聞自由運動，係於第二次世界大戰中應遝　生。當大戰方酣之際，世人受了戰爭殘酷的敎訓，莫不希望這一次的大戰是人類最後一次的戰爭，但是要達到此一目的，則非使各國國內民主與國際諒解不可，因此乃右國際新聞自由運動的倡導。所謂「新聞自由」係包括言論自由及新聞採訪傳遞暨發表的自由。是以此一遝動，含有對內對外雙重的意義。質言之，對內要求政府對於言論自由及新聞的採訪傳遞暨發表，勿予千涉，直接使民意得以充分表現，間接使政府的一切施政方針悉視民意爲依蹄，如此即能促成國內和平民主的實現。至於對外，則爲爭取國際間的新聞自由，只要是現任新聞工作者，均可前往任何一國從事新聞的採訪，不受駐在國政府的干涉，傳遞其所採訪的新聞，也不受駐在國政府的檢查。如此即能消除國際間的誤會，增進各國間的諒解，使任何方式的秘密外交，也無從在暗中進行，以致造成國際間的戰爭。所以戰後的國際新聞自田運動，實爲一種思想的弭戰運動。美國故總統羅斯福氏重視「言論及發表的自由」，列爲其所倡導「四大自由」的第一項，其故當亦即在此。</p>
<p>這次聯合國新聞自由會議的召開，遠在一九四六年十二月十四日，聯合國大會早就通過決議，宣佈新聞自由爲基本人權之一，且爲各項自由之試金石，後至一九四七年八月十五日，經濟暨社會理事會第五次會議，始有更具體的決定，並指定人權委員會新聞自由小組委員會，負責硏究新聞自由槪念。本年一二月間，各方更積極進行，討論新聞自由會議所當採取的方議事日程以及宣言鋼要。各方的意見雖不一致，但在原則上決定四項要旨：（一）新聞自由包括思想及言論自由不受干涉之權利，得以一切方法及不願界限。覓取，接受？傳遞新聞。（二）對於科舉及智識之保持增進以及分佈，頗爲重要；並將促進民衆敎育及文化之散佈。（三）新聞工作者赴新聞來源之處，得享有一切可能方法之權利，在旅行上亦不受任何阻撓。（四）新聞自由及發表自由，亦附有義務及責任。</p>
<p>由此可知，所謂新聞自由，並非完全自由，漫無限制。我國俗語有所謂「二言興邦，一言喪邦」者，記者的一枝筆，不論記載新聞或撰述論文，發表意見，實在不可不愼重。據新聞自由小組會議的決議，將下列事件作爲新聞自由的例外；（一）爲國家安全必須保守秘密之事件；（二）唆使他人以暴力變更政府制度之言論；（三）直接唆使他人犯罪之言論；（四）穢麼之言論；（五）對於公正進行訴訟手續有害之言論；（六）侵害文學與藝術財產權利之言論；（七）損害他人名譽或有害他人而無益於公衆之言論。我國代表對於此一問題，特別重視，曾一再喚起各國代表的注意。因爲個人自由，不能妨害他人自由，更不能妨害社會全體國家民族的利益，此一原則，已成爲各國所共同遵守的道理，新聞自由，自亦不能例外。小組會議也擬就了記者所應遵守的四項基本原則：（一）據事實報道，不存偏見；傳佈所知，不懷惡意。（二）自由交換有關世界經濟，社會，及人道問題之新聞，以便利這些問題的解決。（三）尊重人權及基本自由，不分種族，性別，語言，或宗敎，遇有危害及此時，應設法排除之，並應與危害此種自由及權利之任何思想鬥爭。（四）求各民族間之互相了解及合作，以維持世界和平，同時剷除一切好戰及煽動戰爭的潛　力。</p>
<p>這四項基本原則，在理論上，雖極完善，但是按之實際，能具有此四項條件的記者，實在也不容易。以我國目前的實際情形而論，世界各國的新聞記者前來中國採防新聞，不淪在採防上，傳遞上，無不予以高度的自由與便利，以視世界任何一國，絕無遜色。而且還有外　記者辦理的報紙和通訊社，報紙的言論絕對自由，通訊社發電發稿也無限制，新聞自由的理想</p>
<h3 id="c30">上海徵兵抽籖今日舉行 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>一年一度的徵兵，上海市已積極準備開始了。今天下午三時，本市兵役仃政機構和各方民衆團體，假市參議會舉行本年度徵兵間接抽籤典禮。關於抽籤的方法，聞將於全部及齡壯丁中抽出賦配的總額，凡抽中之壯丁，並不立即予以徵集，俟志願兵登記有缺額時，再以抽籤先後的號數，徵集被抽中的壯丁入營。這個辦法是公平合理，旣符合兵役法的精神，又便利上海首創徵兵抽籤的環境。我們希望上海市民，認識役政的重要　，抽籤爲徽兵必要的步驟，不要在心理上觀念上發生絲毫錯覺。</p>
<p>服兵役，是國民應盡的義務，也是國民應享的權利。有責任觀念的人民，應有捍衛國族保護家鄉的觀念，不僅自己應該率先服役，幷且要勸導自己的子弟和鄉鄰服役，以盡國民的責任。現在整個世界已進入非常時期，歐美各國積極準備兵役動員，和國民普遍軍事訓練，我國北方各省感受共匪殘酷的破壞，各平環境被摧毀了，地方安寗秩序受威脅了，人民的幸福和土地的耕種，失去了良好的保障。在此緊急的關頭，爲了捍衛國族，爲了保護家鄉，兵役動員實在非常必要，刻不容緩的。如果沒有兵役動員，便不能樹立國防力量，更不能樹立地方武力。所以有責任觀念的國民，是瞭解兵役動員意義的，愛家鄉愛地方的國民，更必是熱心服役報國或支持兵役推行的。上海市辦理兵役，僅有一年的歷史，多數人對兵役法的認識還不够，多數人對兵役動員與國家安危地方安寗的關係，尤其認識不，在中國可謂已完全實現。但是經驗告訴我們，界籍記者辦的紙——甚至辦的華文報紙，常刋有違背我民族國家的利益之文字，外國通訊社報道新聞，也常不免歪曲事實，發表不正確的新聞，使我國在國際上的信譽蒙受不利影響，或故意挑撥中國與友邦的情感。我們不得不向新聞自由會領陳訴？要求各　代表深切明暸我國代表團的主張，國際新聞自由制度必須建繁於新聞道德國的基礎之上。</p>
<p>够　所以我們要在徵兵抽籤的今天，喚起市民對這件要政，作淸新有力的注意和高度的警覺。</p>
<p>上海市今年度的徵兵，總配額是六千名，以與全人口五百萬人作比例，則僅及千分之一強。這六千名兵員的徵召，以志願兵和徵兵配合運用，尚非一蹴而行正規的徵兵，完全顧及到上海的地方環境。志願兵係依人民志願而自動服役，不需要强迫；徵兵係依兵役法規定徵第及齡男子而服役。所謂及齡男子是指年滿二十歲之男子而言，凡滿二十足歲之男子或廿一歲至廿五歲之男子，均有依法受徵集服役的義務。今天兵役機關主持的抽籤，依去年度辦理的身家調查及免緩役的申請，所整理的及齡壯丁名冊，在各方民衆團體和與論監督之下，用間接方法抽出何人服役，以及他服役的先後次序，以備志願兵召集不足額時，予以徵集入營。這個辦法公平合理，不徇情，不苟且，很符合平等平允平均的三平精神。如果辦理成續良好，必將樹立良好的風氣。</p>
<p>此外，關於上海市六千兵額徵召後的配用，市參議會建議以就地訓練而保衛上海治安爲願則，並且同時通過了一個決議案，成立淞滬警備旅，業已會同地方法團向中央電請以六千兵額撥配該旅服役。這個建議，基於愛護地方觀念出發，基於保獲多數人的安　　　，更基於保衛這個國家財富之源的大都市願呼喚有志靑年，　人志士，奮勇從戎，參加這個捍衛國族保出發，我們不　　　個良好的建議，希望中央予以採納，並護家鄉的運動。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕海軍代總司令桂永淸，廿二日下午二時假新近自美返國之興安號修理艦，舉行記者招待會，由桂氏及艦長徐時輔先後報告該艦接收經過。略謂：該艦之交接，係以去歲十二月八日在京中美兩國政府於依照美國第七十九届議會第五一一號法案，及一九四七年四月廿五日杜魯門總統簽發之第九八四二號執行令（移讓艦艇所訂之協定）爲根據。接艦官兵九十九人（官十六兵八十三），由徐時輔艦長於去歲六月十九日乘美國海軍運輸艦「布瑞肯格瑞支將軍」號離靑赴美，於新阿爾良港中辦理接收事官。該艦原名「阿其爾斯」號（修理艦），於一九四三年元月開始服役於太平洋，逐島戰役中，曾於新幾內亞之布納島與菲律賓之雷以泰島登陸時，兩度重傷，破壞不堪，經我接艦官兵歷蓋困難，歷四閱月之修理，力告修復，航行返國途中，並曾兩度在舊金山與珍珠港修理，本月十九日駛抵首都。按：興安號艦身長三二八呎，寬五十呎，滿載噸位三一九噸，吃水十三呎，時速十浬，原爲戰車登陸艇，後改裝爲修理艦，以修理步兵登陸艦爲主要任務。又桂氏對該艦　兵徘除困難，化腐朽爲神奇，　成接艦使命，至表佩慰。徐艦　對不這之徒屢對中國新海軍惡　中傷，影響團譽一節，深爲憤　。據稱：該艦駛抵首都時，經　代總司令觀察後，方准官兵離　，乃謠言竟稱帶有大批私貨，買爲無的放失。徐氏極力呼籲輿論界秉公報導，予以洗掃。該艦返國後之首次任務爲派赴菲律賓檢修停舶該地等待接收之美艦，　將之拆卸利用，或拖運高雄船塢修理，一俟護照手續辦妥，即將啓程。</p>

<p>（上接一版）李氏繼答覆記者詢問數點大意如下：（一）關於擴大政府基礎，渠主張將來無論中央政府或地方政府，均應無分黨派，充實人才，勵行三民主義。（二）關於渠本人競選副總統提名問題，究由國大代表提名抑由國民黨中執委提名，現在尚未知悉，但如不能獲得提名，亦並不介意。（三）對於美國援華，渠同意麥克阿瑟之主張，即軍事援助較經濟援助更爲迫切需要，至於究竟需要多少美援始能改善現局，則不能具體答覆，主要的還在於我人自力更生。（四）外傳司徒雷登大使支持本人競選副總統，因最近未與大使見面，故不知道，惟大使與本人私交甚篤。</p>
<p>至此，李氏因尚須拜會本市友好，招待會即告結束，旋以渠本人之放大照相分贈到會記者，晚八時，本市地方協會等團體在林森中路一一〇五號設宴洗塵。李氏定於今日中午在國際飯店設宴答謝各界，下午即將飛京。</p>
<p>書面談話　李氏對競選感想之書面談話如下：「本届國民大會即將在首都揭幕，總統副總統將由大會產生，民選的立法委員亦將自行集會，届時依憲法而產生之新政府乃告成立。此眞我國歷史上一劃新時代，惟憲政實施之功效，不在於憲法之條文與形式，而在於具備憲治之精神，憲治精神爲憲政之靈魂，吾人如無爲國家產生眞正憲政之誠意，則一切措施均不免流爲形式，徒糜公帑而已。本届國民大會，當以選舉總統及副總統為其首要任務，總統人選，蔣主席衆望所歸，舉國擁戴，當無疑義。至於本人參加副總統競選之動機，係基於提倡民主風氣，與對於兩家之責任觀念。良以過去一般國民心理，對於政治多不感興趣，即賢能之士，每以高蹈自矜，不屑參與實際政治，因此政治難期革新，且亦有背民主政治之精神。本人此次參加競選，目的即在提倡民主風氣，促進大家參加政治之熱忱，個人得失，無足介意，但如果當選，當本個人數十年從事軍政工作之經驗，輔助元首，促進政治改革，加强軍事力量，尤須推行民生主義的經濟政策，以謀安定社會，收拾人心。此爲今日解救國家危機之唯一途徑，亦爲余多年一貫之主張，縱令競選失敗，亦必爲此主張之實現而繼續努力也。最近國際局勢，日趨危急，當此嚴重關頭，吾人固須多結與國，爭取外援，然人必自助而後人助之，故吾人必須勵精圖治，自强不息，始足以言外援之爭取也。」</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕義大利下月舉行大選，美蘇爭取義人選票之戰門可能於下星期加緊進行，素來消息靈通人士廿一日稱，預料美國繼西國家宣佈交還特里雅斯德港之後，將在聯合國安全理事會中採取行動，使即速表決准許義大利參加聯合國一事。蘇聯至今否決義國參加，蓋美國拒絕巴爾幹前敵國加入聯合國。在四月大選前，蘇聯再度使用否決權，則義大利共產黨將受嚴重之打擊。國務卿馬歇爾辦事處對此項傳聞表示「無可奉告」。然無人否認美法兩國可能舊事重提。同時外交專家同意，近代世界史上，一國內部之選舉引起兩大國間劇烈競爭，未有若此次之甚者。故義人投票時，不啻在選美國或蘇聯。問題之尖銳化已演成如此程度。美國及其西歐盟國星期六自蘇聯手仲奪得「冷戰」之主動權，而宣布贊成將特港及其所屬內地交還義大利。在處置義殖民地方面，則蘇聯早已擊敗西方。數週前蘇聯表示願支持義大利取得前殖民地之託管權。法國贊成蘇建議，英國則因戰時對阿拉伯國家之諾言而不敢苟同。美國仍以爲其歐洲復興計劃乃最好之王牌。馬歇爾曾兩度警告義人，如共黨很勢，則不能　該計劃之利。交還特港一舉顯然爲國際現行巨額賭注撲克戲中又一張牌，蓋西方三國中無人相信義大利有理由獲得特里雅斯特之全部。據悉，西方國家此次行動敏捷，目的在爭取時間，阻遇蘇聯之類似行動，蓋莫斯科傳出密報，表示蘇聯曾計劃類似上述折衷方案之戰術。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿一日電〕美英法三國昨日建議以義大利和約所產生之特里雅斯特自由區仍交還義大利。該三國政府發表聯合佈告，請求蘇聯以對義和約簽字國之地位，同意在和約中另加一草約，授權交還此一領土。聯合聲明內稱：該三國採取此種行動，乃因受托遴選特港自由區總督之聯合國安全理事會，未能完成此項遴選工作，且因南斯拉夫在其所佔領之特里雅斯特地區內，「已採取種種阻碍運用此種法令之措施」。此項聲明之副本，已提交此間南斯拉夫，蘇聯及義大利等大使館。該聲明謂：有鑒於此等情形，將特里雅斯特交還義大利，將爲「滿足人民之民主意願及使該區重建和平與安定成爲可能之最好解決辦法」。在此項宣佈發表不久之後，美國駐聯合國代表奧斯汀在紐約成功湖聯合國總部向賴依秘書長提出此項建議，要求安理會予以核准。英美法聯合建議將特港歸還義大利，國務院發表之聯合宣言之原文如下：美國，聯合王國與法國政府已向蘇聯及義大利政府建議，即上述三國政府已同意一項協議，主張在對義和約中，另附一項議定書，俾使特里雅斯特自由區再度置於義國主權之下。英美法三國政府作此項決定，係因安全理事會中之討論，業已表明選定總督之協定，不可能達成，且彼等已核獲充份之證據，證明南斯拉夫已經完全變更性質而大部業已併入南斯拉夫，其所經過之程序則並非尊重强國擬以獨立及民主地位給予該區之意願者。當外長會議討論義大利和約之時，美，英，法之代表堅持原定之立塲，即特里雅斯特旣有絕大多數之義大利人口，必需繼續成爲一義大利城市。三國政府旣悉實踐此項決定已不可能，遂同意該城市及一小內陸區建立爲一自由區域。並希望該區係置於如此之情勢之下，即藉有關各方之合作，而保證該區人民（包括義大利特里雅期　城市）之獨立。在總督就職以前，該自由區係由英美軍隊之司令管治北區，由南斯拉夫軍隊之之司令管治南區。在英美區內，英美軍事當局，乃將被任命之總督及代表人民之民主機構之代理人。同時南斯拉夫則在其監督下之南區內一，採取步驟，阻障實踐該區地位之可能者。在此等情形下，三國政府已獲得一結論，即目前之解決辦法，不能保證特里雅斯特自由區人民基本權利與利益之保持職是之故，美國，聯合王國與法國政府已決定建議將特里雅斯特自由區之主權交還義大利，而視之爲滿足人民民主意願以及使該區重建和平與穩定成爲可能之最好解決辦法。由於安理會對於特里雅斯特自由區之獨立與領土完整負有責任，故美國，聯合王國與法國政府將以聯合擬定之辦法、提交安理會，要求予以核准。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務部或白宮即將根據馬歇爾國務卿所主張之支援反極權抵抗運動計劃，發表宣言，其中所將述及之一點，將爲將義前殖民地交還義大利之問題。馬歇爾目前似正集中全力以協助願意防止共黨在四”十八日普選中獲勝之義大利人。杜魯門及馬歇爾均已明白表示此一方略，將爲防止蘇聯控制全歐整個戰略中之一部。分析馬歇爾過去十天中發表之演辭，可以獲得四項基本原則：（一）美國不能同意以武力或威脅而非以合理的民主程序，再事變更歐洲的狀態；（二）美國將自動對於任何落入共產黨控制的政府，停止一切經濟援助；（三）國雖認歐洲之發展爲全世界自由與專暴勢力鬥爭的一部，但美國目前將集中其努力於歐洲方面；（四）美國決以其全部資源支持其外交政策。美國一方面將增強其軍事地位，對反壓迫之自由國家給予更大支持。關於美國在歐洲方面軍事上的責任，雖尚無明白的表示，然而美國第一流外交記者均謂美國已準備於必要時，調兵赴歐。</p>

<p>〔合衆肚倫敦廿一日電〕蘇聯今日指斥將特港歸還義大利爲西方盟國，特別爲美國，企圖干涉義大利選舉之措置。莫斯科電台之廣播第一對三國修改義大利和約之要求表示其反鄉稱：英美法三國「在蘇聯背後策劃」。然廣播中極力避免蘇聯是否將加以接受或拒絕之問題。廣播中稱英美法之建議並未能獲得義大利人民衷心之歡迎。廣播中直指英美法建議主要之目的在誘惑義大利選舉民投票　舉美國代理人之反動政黨而非眞爲義大利人民打算也。上述評論後，莫斯科電台即轉播羅馬義共黨領袖陶格萊蒂長篇指斥馬歇爾計劇之演說。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林二十二日電〕美軍總司令克萊將軍評柏林之事件稱：吾人係本於權利而來柏林，吾人決繼續留在柏林，蘇聯意向如何，目前尚不可知，尚須等待數天，始能抓住蘇聯退出盟管會之眞正意義，蘇聯如繼續拒不參加四强活動，余亦不以爲世界歷史將有極惡劣的轉變。一年來柏林盟管會並無多大成就，余殊不解蘇聯之展延會議，如何能較參加會議更能有效地阻止事務。總之無論如何，在對德和約簽字前，美人決不退出柏林，吾人係太權利來此，整個美國之實力將爲吾人之後盾。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林二十二日電〕此間最高級當局相信，蘇聯已在準備正式文件，即將向英美代表提出，要求英美立即退出柏林，文件內殆將聲明「盟管會旣已無定期延期開會，英美代表已無駐在柏林之需要」，（本社按：一個月前首次傳出蘇聯要求盟國退出柏林之謠言時，美軍總司令克萊將軍在記者招待奮上曾表示「吾人無誰出柏林之意，吾人將於視爲需要期間繼續留在柏林」）觀察家相信：如果蘇聯繼續實行蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基元帥退出盟管會議時從事的政策，則英美蘇關係，將發生新的危險危機。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿二日電〕有鑒於捷克境內之最近發展，美國刻正審查捷克願意與美國政府簽訂關稅貿易協定之「含義與責任」。國務院曾於上週初宣佈一點，即捷克業已通知美國，謂該國願意簽署去年十月間二十三國在日內瓦談判之協定。按美國已與若干其他國家簽署此項協定矣。國務院於昨日發表之另一聲明中謂：「捷克政府已通知本政府，內稱該國擬於一九四八年三月二十日簽字於關稅貿易協定臨時實施之議定書上，而使協定於一九四八年四月二十日臨時生效。」「美國刻正根據捷克境內最近之發展，審查此項協定之含義與責任」。</p>

<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>目前，蘇聯在工業上還不足够堅强可以支持一個攻勢戰爭。縱使到一九六〇年的時候，蘇聯的工業實力大致還不遇美國的五分之二，雖然當時已較目前超出許多而遠在英帝國之上了。</p>
<p>根據英美政府所搜集的材料，目前蘇聯的實力乃在她龐大的人口和她幾乎不可侵入的地理地位。她將來的希望，就寄託在這個龐大的人口以及在未來歲月中可以不斷加以開發的富饒資源上。至於蘇聯的弱點，除了她在戰時所蒙受的損失之外，乃是運輸制度不佳，人民的技能比較低下以及晨業一向不能滿足需要。</p>
<p>蘇聯開發的程度如與美國已往和目前的開發情形相比較，最能提供一個明晰的觀念。</p>
<p>在總能力上，蘇聯大約比美國落後四十五年。在一九四〇年時，也就是對德戰爭開始之前，她的經濟實力約等於一九〇二年時的美國。到一九五〇年，也就是現行五年計劃結束之時，她的實力預計將等於一九〇四年時的美國。到一九六〇年時，假如目前的傾向繼續予以保持，她的經濟地位大致將和一九一五年時的美國相仿</p>
<p>在工人的效能上，蘇聯在一九六〇年時還不能接近美國一九一五年時的水準。根據可以獲得的資料，在一九六。年時，蘇聯每人的生產能力約等於一九一五年時美國人的一半。</p>
<p>在鐵道的長度上，蘇聯遠較美國爲落後。在一九四〇年時，她鐵路的長度約等一八七二年時的美國，換言之，就是五萬七千三百廿三英里。現在，美國的鐵路已達廿二萬六千英里以上了。</p>
<p>自一九二八年蘇聯開始重視工業建設起到一九四〇年為止這一段時間中，蘇聯的開發情形，頗與美國在內戰之後工業開始滋長的情形相仿。一九四〇年前，蘇聯工業進展的速度，約等於一九〇二年前美國工業進展速度的一又四分之一。但是今後她能否保持與美國工業生長相同的速度，尚待事實證明。</p>
<p>蘇聯工業計劇的一個重大挫折，是戰爭所造成的。在這次戰爭中，她損失了百分之五十八的車輛，百分之四十五的鋼鐵生產，百分之四十四的電力和百分之五十八的煤斤生產。此外，她還損失了四分之一的家畜以及數百萬的住屋，農塲建築，敎堂，學校，橋樑和各種商業建築物。她的經濟實力從美國的百分之四十二跌落到祗有百分之二十五。現行五年計劃的一個主要目的，就是補足戰時的損失以及恢復物資和糧食的貯藏。這說明了爲什麽到一九五〇年的時候，預料蘇聯祗能達到美國一九〇四年的水準。（譯自「世界報告」週刊）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市政府爲謀繁榮上海市，曾有越江工程之設計，擬發展浦東，以調節本市之擁擠。特於去年春季成立越江工程委員會，縝密探討後，認爲越江方式，大致以高架橋，低架活動橋，及隧道三者爲主體。但究宜採取何種方式最爲合理，一年來始終未有決定。據記者昨向有關方面探悉：越江工理委員會最近商決，灣定越江工程以建造隧道最爲允當，並經工務局提出上週市府市政會議原則通過。越江隧道地點決定在中正東路黃浦江邊，爲避免進出口處擁擴起見，浦西方面，決定兩處入口：一在中正東路，一在中山東路（黃浦江外灘）。</p>
<h3 id="c84">工程經費來源 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>此項工程建築費來源，經有關當局詳加商討後，認爲以取償於地價增値稅之收入，及徵收通行費較爲合理。目前如即將隧道地點決定，則浦東土地擬即行同時整理重劃，旣可收發展之效，並可解決一部份經費來源。並爲預防地價激漲，妨碍土地重劃之進行起見，擬請依據土地法之規定，將浦東洋涇，塘橋兩區內約卅平方公里之土地，擬先向市府公告保留徵用，制止轉移。</p>
<p>又據確悉：前美籍公用專家康威博士及哈博士等一行來滬考察時，工務局長趙祖康曾與洽談越江工程借款事項，據表示：可予磋商。如經費問題解決，則此上海歷史上所未有之偉大工程，當可望順利興建矣。</p>
<p>建築隧道理由</p>
<p>茲摘錄越江工程委員會議決之越江工程以建造隧道爲宜之理由如下：甲，關於國防事項者：（一）進免空襲，减少威脅。（二）軍艦航行，不受限制。乙，關於港埠發展者：（一）橋樑限制港埠發展。（二）保留滬乍溶港計劃。丙，關於水上交通者：（一）活動橋樑，縮小航道。（二）開橋時間必須配合潮汛。（三）橋墩林立，阻碍潮汛。丁，關於陸上交通者：（一）引橋過長，破壞市容。（二）活動橋樑，運量不多。（三）開橋時間，車輛擁擠。戊，關於工程設施者：橋墩基礎，易於沉陷。己，關於建築經費者：以工費言，活動橋最低，隧道次之，高架橋又次之，就運量言，高架橋最大，隧道次之，活動橋又次之，是活動橋建築費雖省，但運量最小，高架橋運量最多，而工程費最大，故以隧道較爲適宜。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長兼本市物價評議會主任委員吳開先，昨又爲外界可檢舉臺糖公司配糖舞弊事發表談話，說明各點：</p>
<p>（二）關於糖價審議問題：本市依據評議物價實施辦法之規定，組織物價評議委員會，下設食糖組，由社會局，市參議會，台糖公司，糖商業同業公會，南貨商業同業公會等指派代表各一人爲評議員，每二星期召開評議會一次，並邀請民政局派員參加，專司台糖配售價格及批發價格之審議事項，所有議價標準不獨對於產地成本與台幣匯率均詳加考慮，即於當地市價及其他物價亦無不參合硏究。近以一般物價變動太劇，糖價不能例外，所以食糖組評議會原定每二星期開會一次似嫌過久。蓋二星期中變動甚多，商人每多利用糖價固定機會爭相競購而造成議價與市價之差額距離過遠之現象，此後當就事態演變，，將食糖組評議會縮短爲每一星期開會一次，以防止前項事實之發生。</p>
<p>（二）關於糖行登記問題：社會局鑒於配售物資常爲一般商民所爭取，曾擬訂「防止商民投機取巧處理準則」，提請第九十九次市政會議通過施行。凡開設糖行在二年以上並經過二家同業及公會之證明，始得准其登記。登記之後又須向臺糖公司由請配售，再經過調查審核等手續始可獲禪配售。前項辦法不獨對於配糖爲然，其他配紗配布配煤等無不皆然。社會局爲防止投機取巧者之蠶動，除盡力管理登記外，並將　同各有關機關嚴密取締。</p>
<p>又據社會局經濟行政處長顧炳元向記者表示：關於檢舉虛設字號一點，市民如有告發，準備抽查，當局並因糖商所以競設商行學取配糖，係因配價與市價相曰過遠，故正考慮提高配價使與市價相差無多，商人見無利可圖，則舞弊情形自可消滅。</p>

<p>上半年度預算　收入十一萬億</p>
<p>該局歷次出售物資，大多採取標售。洽售。代銷等辦法。底價售價，由經濟部工商輔導處，市參議會，市商會，與該局所組設之評價委員會評定。卅六年財政部將該局收入預算，列為國幣一萬一千億元，惟該局經迭次所售各類物資變價收入，總數達國幣部份一萬五千億元，另有外匯收入美金四百餘萬元，超越原預算百分之六十。本年上半年度，該局令收入預算，列爲總數十一萬億元，截至本年三月十四日止，各項物資變價收入，已達國幣五萬二千億元，另有美金外匯約一百一十五萬元，預期不難達到預算數額。</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州十八日航訊〕月十四日夜，闌州的天空被陰暗的雲層包圍着，開始下降第一次的春雨，淅淅瀝瀝地，在久爲旱災侵襲的蘭州農民眼中看起來，已不復是「汕」樣的可貴，簡直像是「黄金」在下落，光屁股的小孩子，禁不住拍手高唱起：「老大老天大大地下，黄糜麥子五十大……」的兒歌來。</p>
<p>就在這漆黑的夜裏，離城西北五公里的徐家　黄河邊，電燈的光芒刺破凄風苦雨，照耀着一羣人在做</p>
<p>汲水試驗工作　晃動的黑影裏，一個五十多歲的外國人，有着和藹的面容和健康的膚色，配上他那一頭皚皚的銀髮，他在凝思，他在紙上寫着些什麼，在指揮工人做他要想做的工作，在和近旁的兩三個人低聲的說些什麼話，已忘記了雨衣已爲雨點濕透了——那個外國老人便是中央衛生部衛生工程顧問毛理爾博士，那幾個年靑人是蘭州市長孫汝楠，工程師周志昌，謝炳南，建設科長王重義。——他們從晚上八鐘點開始，一直工作到深夜十二點鐘，纔拖着疲乏的身影回到城裏來。</p>
<p>十四日是星期日，上午九點鐘，大家都在計劃着如何消磨過這個苦雨的假日的時候，毛理爾博士和孫市長等，又再度到那個地方，繼續昨夜未竟的試驗工作，並視察其他有關工程的進行，一直到下午五點鐘。</p>
<p>毛理爾博士對他這個汲水試驗是頗惑滿意的；汲水井是用鋼骨水泥裝成，利用工程學中的「沉箱法」，藉水并各部的重量埋入土中，使之較最低的水位再降下四公尺，較最高的水位高出一公尺，以便汲水容易；他們所以漏夜工作的原因，是利用夜晚比較充足的電力，作</p>
<p>水位昇降測驗　來計算汲水樣所抽得得水的供應量。</p>
<p>蘭州一般人民對自來水這東西的印象是糢糊的，對毛理爾這種試驗工作是淡漠的他們對毛理爾博士說過「自來水工程完成後，對市民健康裨益實大，至少死亡率可减少百分之十以上」的話，是很難相信的。但毛理爾並不以這種科學的愚昧爲杵，他以能爲這些愚昧無知的，純樸誠實的中國老百姓服務，是引爲無上安慰的。</p>
<p>我們回溯一下毛理爾博士和</p>
<p>中國人的關係　便可作為證實。他生於美國麥薩徹斯州的哈弗里爾城，在麥薩徹斯工學院畢業後，便來到中國天津北洋工學院執教，那時正是民國紀元前宣統三年，他目擊了滿淸皇室的昏瞆，也迎接了中華民國的新生，三年之後，他又重回新大陸，在芝加哥·巴的魔爾等城工作，從那時起，他對中國已有了然切的愛好。民國三十年，再來中國服務於滇緬鐵路；三十四年，再度接受美國國務院文化合作事業委員會的委派，以世界衛生組織的名義，爲我國衛生部担任衛生工程顧問之職·——他在我國停留的期間，綜計起來不過六七年，但他却適逢我國三個新生的時代，從推翻滿清到抗戰正股，從國土重光到積極戡亂，在這許多年日動邊不已的歲月裏，他有他的觀感，他曾對人說：「歷年的動亂，並未毁滅了中國的任何建設，相反地，中國是在動亂裏蛻變着，已有顯著的進步和發展，尤其是在教育方面，中國的智識靑年對祖國服務的精神和愛國的熱忱，是很値得欽佩的。此外婦女解放運動，也有很好的成就，記得我第一次來中國的時候，一般婦女都不識字，整天不敢出門，甚至和我私交極篤的北洋工學院黄院長，他的太太也從來沒有和我碰過面，而三十多年的過程，中國已有了大學女校長，女參政員，女記者了……」</p>
<p>他不但認識一千五六百個中國字，而且還會說一些音調沉重的中國話，略帶北平口音的中　話。近三年來，他對我國各都市的上水和下水的問題解決都有過貢獻，雖然這些貢獻還沒有結出碩大的果實。他曾爲</p>
<p>南京重慶長沙　做過一套下水道和自來水的工程設計，自來水工程方面，曾改進南京的自來水工程供應設施，爲四寗草成初步計劃，爲闌州完成了全部的設計和解決了開工以後的各種困難問題，他定三月十九日，赴西安設計該地的自來水工程，再赴天津擴充該地的自來水工程。假如世界衛生組織在最近結束，他便要向中國暫時告別了。</p>
<p>他對我國衛生建設的觀感是：「衛生建設因爲沒有充裕的經濟基礎，很難達到理想的境地，但所可樂觀的，目前的中國人民，已開始瞭解衛生對於人生的重要性了；他們不僅在注意個人的衛生，同時也開始督促政府建設公共的衛生設施，這是一個國家走入更理想地步的好朕兆。」</p>
<p>他設計中的闌州自來水工程，據他的計劃，以市區中心的人口十二萬五千人作標準，全部經費以六十萬元硬幣作標準，則平均每人負擔不到五元，和美　的自來水工程相比較，要低對十倍之多，他說，一個</p>
<p>優良的工程師　不僅要　設計理想的計劃，更要以當地的經濟力量作爲設計的依據，這便宜是他設計闌州自來水工程力求簡單的原因。</p>
<p>闌州自來水的基金，一共是四十億元多，於上年九月一日正式興工，購地建廠，築水　，添置水表，五金橡皮，馬達抽水機等配件，消耗的已經差不多快完了，（目前結存五億七千四百餘萬元）甘肅省政府准予向農行借貸一百億元，一時還不能確定可否成功，但是裝管等工程必須於洪水期前做好：目前最需解決的水管問題，行總撥給的一百廿七噸，還擱在上海無法啓運，若由此問機器廠鑄製六十三噸水管，最少還要廿二億元，自來水工程處已無力承這一筆費用。現在已採用毛理爾博士的建議，決定用水泥管和木管代替一部份鋼管，最快今年十一月間，便可完成全部的工程，那時毛理爾博士，將再來蘭，目睹他苦心孕育的嬰兒的誔生了。（本報記者宋麟）</p>

<p>〔本報無錫廿日訊〕蘇省各縣糧商，爲免征糧食業營業稅問題，於十六日再度赴省請願，本邑糧商代表趙章吉，張景煒等。返錫後，據稱：此次向財廳請願，董廳長對免征問題，仍認爲難予接受，至於稅額之减輕，及征收之辦法，則表示可以從長計議。財廳張科長對稅　一節，曾提出非正式估計，渠以全省五百萬人口計算，每人每日平詢消耗食米二合，按照百分之一·二稅率計算，則全省每年糧食營業稅，可征起三千億以上。當時省臨參會冷議長，認爲政府對糧食業不能與其他貨物並論，良以糧食之消耗，富人極少，全屬窮人身上，故對此項問題，亦表反對，各縣代表，將堅持力爭。</p>

<p>〔本報福州十八日航訊〕去年七月十二日，曾有一個極盛大的典禮，在僑都厦門揭幕。閩省劉主席華南各地工商界鉅子，暨南洋各處屬僑領，紛紛趕赴參加，那就是胡文虎主持的華僑經建公司成立典禮。該公司的創設，被譽爲「能够容納各屬各階層僑資投集，並能用以大規模發展建設事業的首次創舉」。（劉主席語）如今，該公司成立已經快十個月了。關於這段期間各地僑商投資情況，暨該公司過去及將來業務，該為國內注意工商經濟人士所樂於知道的吧。</p>
<p>「這一個月。是南國春暖花開的季節，也就是一般在工商業上曾是穩紥穩打的人，如今也開始縱橫馳聘的季節。華南在國內經建投資各方面，還是一個富有誘惑性的豐腴處各地，在策事發展集中北方，大量</p>
<p>資金開始南移　的今天，作為華南重要一環的福建，當然不會爲人所忽略。觀於中紡公司榕辦事處的成立，資委會閩勘察團的開始計劃，美商江南建設公司之籌建紙漿廠，央行專員常常往返榕厦，浙江興業銀行經理羅郁銘，專員盛慕傑之來閩，擬設分支機構……等等，均令人對此後閩省資源開發問題逗引起不少興趣。這中間，尤以經建公司的一舉一動最易引人注目，因爲畢竟該公司資本的伸延性太大了，同時對於閩省計劃性規模性開發事業的關係也太大了，該公司副經理何葆仁恰於這期間內由厦來榕，視察業務，由是記者也多得了一個機會，多得到一些關於該公司發展業務的消息。</p>
<p>經建公司成立　的動機，原為鎔鑄各屬僑資於一爐，用以開發鄉梓富源爲主旨，故該公司股東散佈甚廣，胡文虎曁其公子胡好一便是重要股東之一，其餘如在荷印的黄超龍，黄超羣，陳丙丁等，在越南的陳肇基，顏子俊等，在菲律賓的黄其華，馬來亞的李君俠，以及在新加坡，檳榔嶼，霹靂，班貢，香港，厦門，上海…各地有鐘文賢，白成根，陳六使，黃重吉，林樹彥，王振相，黄如水，林雅碩，黃浴沂，何葆仁等，他們所以要採取這一方式，無非想透過彼等在各該屬的社會經濟地位，從而把握吸收到各部分僑資，從事更擴大的投資計劃，可是這一計劃，當時由於荷印緊張，菲律賓，婆羅洲方面是僑匯損失太鉅，兩者均受影響，故原定二百億元資本，届成立之際，僅收到一百億元。</p>
<p>辦理三大部門　（一）工廠部門，設有鐵工廠一所，經辦翻砂，製釘，修理器械各項工作，廠址厦門，（二）貿易部門，設有華僑經建貿易公司，經辦南洋，香港，上海，寗波，無錫，各地貿易，（三）投資部門，經先後投資者有福州市經建公共汽軍公司，厦門市輪渡公司，古田漢水力發電公司，有一時期，還投資過德化的造瓷廠，以及計劃過投資閩北土產運銷公司，其間業務情形，雖因客觀情勢限制未臻理想，然以當事者高瞻遠矚，獲利亦甚可觀。</p>
<p>當然，以上所述，不過是該公司日前試探性質所經辦的一些，關於其此後計劃，尚留有很大餘地。據何副總經理談稱：目前閩省</p>
<p>主要興辦事業　為交通，水力，森林三者，該公司決通力與省當局合作開發，此次劉主席在厦業與商談，渠站在政府立塲，只准公司成功，不准失敗。該公司同人頗表興奮，因之，亦有增資五百億元計劃，關於這，何氏談到未來初步計劃如下：</p>
<p>（一）設立經建銀行：此舉過去因限於政府法令，未能成立，唯爲調劑金融，吸收僑匯，扶助工礦事業計，該行之設，似屬迫不及待，故一俟請准，仍欲設立。</p>
<p>（二）設立工廠：爲配合閩省重要農產品加工，該公司決於最近興辦工廠數所，以加强外銷，挽回利權。</p>
<p>（三）開採煤礦：該公司計劃在閩西某地開採煤礦，時間在最近，確切地點，暫不宣佈。</p>
<p>（四）發展交通：當與煤礦採掘計劃，與土產運銷路段配合進行。</p>
<p>（五）增加分支機構，按目前已有厦門福州兩公司及香港，上海，廣州各辦事處，今後決再增加，尤以台灣最近即欲設一分公司，然後再推及南洋。</p>
<p>記者詢及最近</p>
<p>京滬一帶工廠　大都有南遷計劃，經建公司是否可能與之投資合作，共同經營，何氏稱：目前福建此舉恐尚難實現，主要原因厥爲電力供應及原料運輸二者，前者必俟古　漢水電裝設成功後，方能解決，後者必俟省內數主要幹綫完成後，乃能置議，總之，何氏稱：「經建公司有的是雄厚僑資，但是，它的成長和繁榮，要靠政府切實的保障，尤以進出口結匯，原料採購，工廠開設各方面，需要政府協助的地方最多。不然，有了資本，處這金融波動劇烈的今天，也是無用的。他認爲經建公司的股東都有南洋各屬富有地位的僑領，辦公司的目的服務性質高於贏利目的，增資極爲可能。</p>
<p>何副經理是厦門人，今年五十三歲，與胡文虎是老同事，在南洋馬來屬各地經辦社會救濟事業，已埀三十年。在榕的有旬日勾留，視察汽車公司等業務，隨後還須至合灣各地一行·（本報記者黄埀慶）</p>

<p>〔本報西安十八日航訊〕從二月廿二日起，平靜的西北角，又起了大戰，這次戰爭規模之大，砲火之烈，實在是空前的，國軍劉戡軍長用自己的生命與熟血，在剿匪史上，寫下了最壯烈的一頁。宜（川）洛（川）之間，土山交橫的凹子街成了西北的「孟良崮」。</p>
<p>陜北共匪　上月開高級軍事會議，據事後傳說朱德·彭德懷·趙壽山都親自參加，他們決定了由今年春天起，從宜川開始，吃下　城，再向西竄，截斷延安與西安的交通，赤化謂北，再將咸楡沿綫的國軍據點，分別包圍，個個擊破。他們的野心，是預備以黄龍山區及馬欄等舊日的囊形地帶爲根據，使渭河北岸，成了晋南，使渭水以南的地方成爲豫西的局面。二月廿二日，共匪第一·三·二·等三個縱隊，竄至宜川城郊，激戰展開，匪軍數次猛攻，悉被城內國軍擊破。廿七日，劉戡將軍在洛川實行圍剿。</p>
<p>率部誓師　劉戡將軍對他屬下的官兵們說：「匪軍這一次動員了七八萬人，想在陝北搗亂，我們身爲革命軍人，必須予以嚴重打擊，近十餘月來，我們很羨慕華中東北的國軍能和匪軍痛快的大打，而我們在陝北，一直找不到土匪打，這次機會來了，我們一定要活捉朱毛，以絕後患，我們成功成仁，在此一戰」！語調激昂，正氣滂薄，士氣因之大振，劉氏且令高級幹部各立遺囑，以決其志。</p>
<p>國軍在誓師之後，由洛川向東進發，宜洛之間，山地縱橫，地勢非常複雜。山脈由西北向東南迤去，土質貧瘠，像陝北其他地方一樣，凹子街（距宜　三十華里）在山選之間的講中，所以名子呌凹子街，居民二十餘戶，冷落荒凉。國軍的先頭部隊周由之·李達兩旅，在那附近奧匪軍發生遭遇，當時匪首王震適由　南率來二·八兩個縱隊，有六個旅的番號約二萬餘人，我軍與匪拼命激戰之後，全部光榮殉國。匪軍大部分向南北潰退，一部佯向宜川城郊竄潰。那一仗國軍雖陣亡萬餘，而匪軍在我猛烈砲火之中，亦死亡萬七八千人以上。</p>
<p>陝北的春天是寒冷的，二月尾，天還在落雪，當周·李·兩旅長殉職之訊證實後，劉戡將軍憤火塡胸，乃冒雪親率嚴（明）王（應尊）出擊。</p>
<p>兩師出擊　由嚴師任右質，王師任左冥，因爲十氣特別旺盛，勢如破竹，一路前進，所向無敵。三月一日上午，劉戡將軍部下一參謀人員，向劉氏說，王　匪部，乃才由晉南調來，其勢正說，今窩藏於宜川西南之丹陽東南，我們應該以主力解決此股土匪，然後再北上追剿彭部匪軍，否則進軍於雨者之間，因衆寡縣殊，恐難獲全勝。」劉氏憤慨的說：「王震毛賊，那裏是我的對手，我必須打垮彭匪，方能去心頭大恨，才能報喪師之恨！」於是就向凹子街進發，一日中午，到達該地，即築工事，預備次日再向宜川縣部推進。當天晚上，突遭匪軍襲擊，當時我方工事係東西兩面築有緊强之防衛綫，南北則非主力，匪軍王震部由南來，彭德懷部由西北循山而下，將凹子街固圍，達六層之多。激戰進行了半夜，匪軍尚朱攻入我方陣地，於是匪渤海縱隊之砲兵，密集轟繫彈落如雨，形成一片火海。四週工事，幾成平地。</p>
<p>反覆衝殺　之後，凹子街週　之山頭，失去兩個，嚴明師長乃率同勤務伙伕向山頭衝進，以手溜彈向敵陣地攻擊，以至人亡彈盡，嚴將軍乃以最後一顆手溜彈，自轟殉國。匪軍包圍圈子，更加緊縮，劉戡將車看見部屬全部壯烈犧牲，乃以手槍自戕·那時正是夜半以後，晚風凄厲，天猶未明。</p>
<p>劉戡將軍和他的部屬與士兵，就這樣的寫下了他們壯烈的史詩，他們雖然死去了，而匪軍陝北晋南兩地的精銳在劉將軍的激戰之後，也喪失了戰鬥力，共匪在三月十九日的「收復延安」的「春夢」，也澈底被擊潰了。至於王應尊師長的下落，有的說是中砲身亡，有的說遭匪俘去，現在傳說不一。</p>
<p>生命是不朽的，革命戰士們的生命更是不朽的，他們英勇的戰蹟，壯烈的犧牲，將被寫在戰史上，他們的史詩，將產生更大的鬥志！（本報記者張僊洲）</p>

<p>〔本報成都十八日航訊〕近數十年，在考古界一件空前盛事，是民國卅一年川省立博物館，發掘前蜀王建墓—永陵。在當時，確曾轟動考古學者的非常注意，但由於八年抗戰，繼以戡亂，使國內考古界對於千餘年前典章文物的研究，未能整理，到最近，川博物館爲了引動國內文化界對永陵文物價値的新認識，特舉行「永陵文物公開展覽」，在成都尚是數年來稀有的一件文化界盛事。</p>
<p>古物羅列　雕像簡冊謚寳</p>
<p>這次展覽，主要是一度整理後的墓中殉葬遺物，展覽會塲的舊皇城至公堂，古物羅列，琳琅滿目。有石造王建雕像一尊，高約三尺許，冠服袍帶，高鼻廣額，縷塑精緻，形貌莊嚴。有鐵鑄宰官武將像數尊，高二尺五寸，貌極英武。有玉册數十簡，哀册及謚册各五十三簡，每册長尺許，寬二寸，邊樓金屬花紋，上刻有字，雖垢苔斑剝，猶約略可誦，文作於光天元年（王建年號，當梁貞明四年，公元九一八年），記王衍遷陸經過。册均置於精緻之鐵匣中，匣作深朱色，上鐫雙鳳及彩雀花紋，精工縷刻·外有金質謚寶，刋「高祖神武聖文孝德明惠皇帝謚寶」十四字，已將風化，據傳尚有金佛及金是各一，允稱精品，於發掘後，早爲有力者攫去。</p>
<p>文物制度　代表中華文明</p>
<p>展覽文物，皆是千餘年前的古物。考王建爲五代時前蜀王，「五代史」載：「梁祖朱溫於唐天祐二年，弒昭宣帝纂唐，稱開平元年，四川王建是年稱「大蜀皇帝，改元武成」。又載：「…迄光天元年六月姐」，蜀「檮杌」云：「光天元年戍寅六月，建薨，年七十二，葬永陵」·「成都文類」及陸放翁詩，均指明永陵—王建墓在成都西郊，但明曹學佺「蜀中名勝記」却指爲司馬相如之撫琴台，後人遂以訛傳訛，成爲成都有名勝蹟之一·清宣統二年，一度爲鄉人發掘。民國廿七年，寶成鐵路材料廠於合畔掘防空洞，此墓遂被發現。其後以地方人士牽制反對，卅一年始由川省古物保存會與博物館合作，進行發掘工程。卅三年工程，方告段落，正式展覽，則以這一次為矯矢。</p>
<p>有唐一代，爲中華文物最盛之時，當時全國干戈紛擾，兩川獨得安定，而以繁榮甲天下，是以王（建）孟（知祥）前後蜀時代，爲四川歷史上最繁盛時期，當時的交物制度，也確可代表中華民族極盛時代的大部文明，這一次展覽規模雖小，但記者在參觀後，認爲頗有供國內考古界參考的價値，這在離亂擾攘的今日。將未始不是一件文物盛事。（本報記者周學端）</p>

<p>市社會局以連日米價又見上揚，而本市戶口配米尚稱順利，惟爲徹底澄清市塲利買空氣，加强食米供應起見，特於昨日再行拋售食米，計早稻一一三五有，每石配價爲三六〇萬，蕪秈一〇〇石，配價三二〇萬元。爲迅予出倉起見，並由糧部上海總倉庫公佈另　出米地點，以炎迅速見效。至連日氣候陰雨，客銷難暢，而市塲到貨又夥，達一六〇七三石五斗，故昨日米糧行市疲落。其他食糧亦見帶下，白粳中貨三八五萬元，羊秈中貨三八〇萬，早稻三七〇萬，白元三九〇萬元。</p>
<p>據悉民調會有大批食米存儲介庫中，擬在市塲售川，惟並不按日拋售，而係採取機動方式，視市塲需要情形而定，以免影響食米來源。</p>
<p>麵粉隨米價下跌，晨開即疲，兵船以上週收市價開盤，最高曾至一百六十萬，結果回低至一百五十七萬五千元收市。老車一百五十八萬，建成，紅蜂等各下降二三萬元。麩皮挫五千，小麥二百二十五萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧　一致堅挺，尤以苞米紅糧在靑帮之傾力購吸下，上漲殊力。前者猛升二十餘至三十萬，紅糧則勁升二十餘萬元。揀靑到貨久寂，亦激漲二十萬，黄豆平定，惟平湖杜豆升十萬，特粗高達二百六十三萬元，芝蔴出戶少，挺二十萬，生仁客帮歇手，獨降十餘萬。</p>
<p>食油　開市尚平，旋以出戶不多及本街添納甚多，故即轉挺。油廠鮮有開出，豆油都爲回龍交易，收市均漲五萬。大有豆油叩八百萬大關，生油挺升較力，良以到貨不多也。靑島吉桶生油九百六十五萬，計漲十五萬元。生蔴油，生菜油各砌五萬元，大小車蔴油勁升二十萬，豆餅初洛後秀，結果仍低萬元。</p>

<p>昨日錦布市况，晨開時以美匯又將掛高，流言頗盛，買氣仍濃，各貨俱在硬檔徘徊。龍頭細布曾哄高至四百四十九萬元，旋聞謠傳不實，多頭居高思危，同時銀根仍緊，競相拋售，散戶相繼吐出，客帮袖手觀望，走勢呆鈍，大戶鑒於環境轉變，支持乏力，因此賣氣轉濃，喊價下游。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，回低至四百三十四萬元收市，較之週末回瀉六萬，星期日塲外價會喊高至四百六十五萬，故比較則狂跌二三十萬元左右，餘亦跟踵下挫。四君子等嗶嘰亦以吐售較夥，下挫五六萬元，此外漂布及白坏布染廠逢低有吸，市盤挺秀，色布藍布士林布守因銷令將届，廠盤依然堅挺，故行情步升有四五十萬元之鉅。</p>

<h3 id="c185">希臘哲學誕生的前夕 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>人類生於自然環境之中，與自然界接觸，自然界的東西，如天，地，山，川，風，雨，雷，電，……等等，對於他們，一方面加以生上活上的壓迫，另一方面引起他們的好奇心。他們因受壓迫而驚，因好奇而疑，這雨種心理便是知識的導火綫。</p>
<p>希臘的先民起初解決驚與疑的方法是神話的宗教。他們能力薄弱，受肖然界的壓迫與眩惑，無法奈它何，就想請出若干超自然的神，來抵制自然；並且他們因缺乏探討的一經驗，便圖簡捷的手段，像行魔術似的，來解決他們的問題。况且他們幣與疑的心理雖然同時產生，然而因生活上壓迫的念切，畢竟驚多於疑；所以須要一種　够錄壓自然界之淫威的　，他們驚慌的心理也藉此稍得安慰。這是古希臘神話的宗教之所以產生的原因。</p>
<p>他們神話的宗教是多神的，也是擬人的（Anthropomorphic）。什麼呌做擬人？就是以爲神伺人一樣：有家庭，社會，國家的組織，所以也有君臣，父子，夫婦，兄弟，朋友的關係；有感情上的喜，怒，哀，樂，愛，惡，欲，所以也有酬應賞罰。總而言之，人的美德，神也盡有，人的醜態，神也畢具，只是神的力量遠過於人，甚至自然界的一切，都是他們所創造的，也是他們所管理的。擬人的觀念是初民時代最普遍的，所以希臘有一位哲學家說，假如牛馬會有宗教，它們心目中的上帝一定也是一隻牛，一匹馬。這種觀念固是出於坐井觀天的小見，然而因此又能看出當時人類的另一心理；他們變自然界的壓迫，自己莫可奈何，恨不得把另一批比自己力量大得多的人，即他們所想像的神，抬出來和自然抵抗一下；不但能抵抗，自然界的一切簡直就是他們所創所管，只要把他們敷衍得好，自然的浮威便有，他們主鎭　，自己不必再操心了。</p>
<p>然而這種宗教，雖然能安慰驚恐之念於一時，却不能滿足好奇之心於永久。况且擬人的神，卑汚惡濁旣與人等，再加以無上的權威，其對於人類感情上的壓迫，並不亞於自然界中不如人意的事，那麼，因要抵制自然的淫威，倒換來神權的淫咸，豈不是以暴易暴？於是希臘先民得到一個新的覺悟，就是：要抵制自然的壓迫，不能在自然以外想辦法，必須認識自然本身，在它的範圍以內，求其壓迫的原因，然後執因以御果，人的力量才能奏效。這就是後來培根的「人類知識與權力合一」的看法，也是他所謂「服從自然以駕御自然」之精神的開端。在這種新覺悟的看法與精神之下，便產生了希臘的哲學。</p>
<p>由神話的宗教進到哲學，是西洋文化的一個轉向，從那時起直到今日，總在一條路上發展。這條路是什麼？就是理智。所以希臘哲學的誕生，算是西洋人開始用他們的理智，在自然界做敦掘的工作。</p>
<h3 id="c186">叔本華的自殺論 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 少雄</p>
<p>打開報紙來一看，隨時都可以看見自殺的新聞。今天是張某的自殺，明天是李某的自殺。自殺似乎是有傳染性的。只要報章加以渲染，加以哀憐，加以同情，甚或加以稱美時，自殺可以增加起來。在這個民窮財盡，變亂頻繁的年頭，大家都感覺到生存的不易，自殺也許是解決生活問題的最簡單的方法。目前自殺事件之多，這當然是一種最主要的原因。</p>
<p>自殺是社會的一種病態，無論如何，這決不是社會之福。但自殺的行爲是正當嗎？自殺算不算是一種犯罪行爲呢？換一句話，站在倫理或道德的立塲上，我們有沒有反對自殺的正當理由？十九世紀德哲叔本華（ArthurSchopehhauer）有一套自殺的理論。本文打算介紹他的理論，然後略爲加以批評。</p>
<p>叔本華的理論，表面上是矛盾的。他一方面是同情自殺，另一方面他又反對自殺。站在一種立塲上，他認爲自殺是正當的。自殺決不是一種犯罪行爲。我們要知道自殺是否是犯罪行爲，我們自身的道德情感便可加以決定。當我們聽到某一我們所知道的人，犯了謀殺罪，或盜竊罪，或欺騙罪時，我們的情感是什麼？及當我們聽到某一熟知的人自殺時，我們的情感又是什麼？對於前一事件，我們必定發生道德上憤怒的情感，必非常厭惡這一人，且必要求加以處罰，加以報復。可是對於後一事件，我們的情感便不同。我們的情感是悲哀和同情，兼而有崇拜他的勇氣的思想混合在內。我們可以說，後一事件也和前一事件一樣，都是犯罪行爲嗎？可見自我們的道德情感言，自殺決不是犯罪。自殺之不是犯罪，從古今中外，聖哲英雄的言論和行爲來說，也可獲得充分的證明。聖經上，不論新舊約，都沒有禁止自殺的明文。反對自殺，只是宗教家的私見和偏見。一位古代羅馬的作家普令爾（Pin）嘗謂：「就是上帝也不是一切事件都是可能的；因如他的意志是要死的話，他却不能完成他自已的死，可是在我們世間生命上的一切痛苦中，死却是上帝送給人類的最好的贈品」。至古人之以自殺爲榮的事件，更不知多少。印度人且以自殺爲一種宗敎行爲。劇本作者之謳歌自殺，復是中外常有的事。我們有什麼理田可以反對自殺呢？所以如果法律禁止自殺，這是一種最可笑的事件。因對於死且不懼的人，還有什麼懲罰可加諸於他呢？自殺是人類的權利。每一人除了他自己的生命和身體外，還有什麼是他更有不可侵犯的權利的呢？</p>
<p>但站在另一種立塲上，叔本華却反對自殺。叔氏之反對自殺，不是視自殺爲犯罪行爲而加以反對，却是視自殺不是否定生侖的良好手段而加以反對。根據叔氏的哲學，人類生命是充滿痛苦和罪惡的。而這種生命的來源，却是由於意志，由於生之意志。我們要消滅人類的痛苦和罪惡，我們須得否定生之意志。不過，要否定生之意志，這並不是自殺所能達其目的。自殺不是生之意志的否定，反之，這乃最是生之意志的肯定。蓋生之意志的否定，不是由逃避生命的痛苦而構成，乃是由逃避快樂而構成。當自殺者把他的存在作爲一個體而加以消滅時，他並沒有消滅他的生之意。自殺者的生之意志是很强的。如他有法滿足他自己，如他能肯定他的意志去反抗環境的力量，也是　意生存的。只因爲壞境的力量過强，他抵抗不住時，他才自殺。以故，自殺者深入的意志是要生而不是要死。他雖把軀體摧毁了。這種生之意志仍是存在的。自殺不是生命的解脫，我們要超出生命，要否定生命，當另覓手段，而不當以自殺爲手段。這是叔氏反對自殺的主要理由。而且叔氏認爲自殺也是一種笨拙的實驗。他說：「自殺也可以視爲是一種實驗，是人想對自然提出一個問題，而强迫自然加以回答的實驗。這問題是：死將對於人的存在及人關於自然事物的洞見有什麼變化呢？這乃一種笨拙的實驗，因這是把提出問題及正在等候回答　　　義也消滅了。」</p>
<p>簡單的以上就是以本　的自殺理論。不論他是同情自殺或反對自殺，他的主要錯誤有二：一在視生命爲個人的，二在視生命爲充滿痛苦和罪惡的。視生命爲個人的，個人自有處置之權而自殺便是正當的。可是事實上，生命決不光是個人的。生命必有所自來。自生命的來源說，我們一生下，生命便不是個人的，是有父母和祖宗的血統和功績在內的。及生命的長成，則社會民族的功績，更是不可缺少的因素。沒有社會民族的協助，生命必無法長成。所以一個長成的生命，決不是個人所獨有，而是社會民族所共有。這樣，個人即沒有自由處置之權，而肖殺也就成爲不正當的。次則，視生命爲充滿痛苦和罪惡的，則消滅痛苦和罪惡，自然也是正當。不過，生命雖有痛苦和罪惡，而生命決不光是痛苦和罪惡。謂生命充滿痛苦和罪惡，或謂人生是痛苦多於快樂，罪惡多於良善這不是有什麼科學統計爲根據的結論，而只是個人的偏見，或是以最少事例爲根據的結論。叔氏以個人有限的觀察，及忽視生命的另一面，遂有若是的判斷。假如我們從生命的光明處去看，復擴大我們觀察的範圍，我們也許可以得到和叔氏相反的結論。所以我們決不能視叔氏的結論爲絕對正確，因而我們也不能贊同其自殺的理論。我們要知道，對於自殺者，我們自可以發生哀憐和同情之感，惟哀憐和同情，却不就是道德上的贊許。雖屬萬惡的謀殺犯，當他臨刑的一剎那，我們也可以動哀憐或同情之感，我們能視這種情感爲道德上的贊許嗎？哀憐和同情是一事，而道德上的贊許又是另一事，兩者不能混爲一談。我們可以哀憐自殺者，可以同情自殺者，唯一般而論（這自有例外），我們却不能視自殺者的行爲是正當。這就是作者的結論。</p>

<p>今有恒言，曰「精神文明」，曰「物質文明」。此二名詞，吾國人士耳之熟而知之審，　其語焉能詳者矣。顧若叩以斯二者之性質，其所　於一國一族之存立者如何，輒復茫然　得其指歸。以故十餘年前，一二學界巨子乃有「全盤西化」之論。</p>
<p>夫所謂精神文明者，無亦一國一族之哲學，科學，美術，宗教，論理，政治，也已。而所謂物質文明者，則其民人物質上之製作，所以爲利用厚生者耳。前者，一國　族之所以爲存，之所以別於異國異族；是而墜地，國族斯泯斯後者，富强之俱，　國異族所不必異，而得以假借取資者也。絀於後者，一國一族或且暫屈於他國他族，而不致終凶；細於前者而亡，斯萬刧不回，人道之慘，草是過矣。</p>

<h3 id="c188">匹夫有責之原子能問題 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 李廉太爾原著　陳卓如譯</p>
<p>反應機的基本目標，大衆皆應有機會明白，因爲關於原子能工作的其它重要知識皆可從此推求。一個人如果了解這三點，就可以了解爲什麼花在製造並改良原子彈這一類武器的錢與光陰可以直接帮助工業動力的發展。這已經不止說過一次二次了。製造原子彈與利用原子核的能力爲建設用，兩者的途徑有百分之八十五是相同的。</p>
<p>動力自然是原子能最炫耀的應用，但現在仍不可能，也不是轉一個灣就可能了。兩三年後，我們可能有一個爲表演或試騐用的原子能動力廠——我們可以用它點燈，曳機。有些科學家和工程師說在十年後，我們可能有一個相當實用並且經濟的原子動力機。但就是如此，在十年後，原子動力仍不會便宜的。</p>
<p>反歷機的第三點——即中子的產生——它所產生的好處，就是想像最富的卡通晝家，亦難料到。這個反應機可能因將各種物質經中子撞擊而產生今天所完全不知道性質的物質。這些物質中，有的可使我們利用這種反應機爲動力來源的，也可能對於普通動力機很重要。</p>
<p>原子能發展的副產研究可能有了不得的結果。例如原子能研究工作中有一部分是關於戴的，便在化學中開闢了一個新天地，即氟碳Fluorocarbons。有些人說它將來的希望堪與原子能比擬</p>
<p>爲靑年求新出路，爲病人求新希望，爲科學用諸和平事業的新了解——這是現在與最近將來的議程中幾個節目。</p>
<p>但這些事——和我還可以提及的一些——仍祗是一個發靱。知識之門方才打開一點。沒有一個人能够預料知道物質底細以後會來些什麼變更。我們要記得每一個生物也是原子構成的，我們所說的原子能也在這些原子中。也要記得一切的物質，例如印這些字的紙，你坐上的椅子，山與海，都是原子與原子核造成的。</p>
<p>因此原子能的研究使我們知道我們生存着的世界的性質。要緊的不但是要了解這些基本刀量的知識可能產生如何如何的具體功效，這自然是很赫耀的，而更要知道這些知識會帶來些什麼重要變遷——這些變遷是一定會帶來的。</p>
<p>我們所關懷的不是變遷會來。這在我們今日是看慣了的。我們喜歡變遷。我們所關懷的是這些變遷要能配合我們的生活，它　　不為碍我們一個人自由，我　對　　種　明，關於社會，生活，農業教育，工業與軍事　度各方面　影響，應該操着主動　節制。</p>
<p>原于科學會引起一大羣　共它方面的新發明：這已在開始而且會光大。但是人民不應該使這些技術的發展跳過他們的黨握。若果如此，民主理想便完了。歸根究底，便該如下。</p>
<p>（一）我們要一點不放鬆，直到人類不會利用原子能力於破壞及目私的目的去；</p>
<p>（二）（直接與第一有關的）我們要努力鼓勵原子能現有的發明，及將來可能的新發明，應用到與八類有益並且合乎人道理想的一些方面去。</p>
<p>現實而且不易解決的問題是：我們利用這種日增未已的新知識到那些芳面去？</p>
<p>解決這個重大問題所需要的，不是專家的判斷，因爲這不復是科學的事，而是國家中成百成千社幽中諸先知先覺的人道經驗與良知。除了有識民衆的常識外，再沒有一個更好的方法，可以作這些方面的判斷。</p>
<p>爲什麼每一個公民應該知道原子能的基本事實，原因極多。此中理由之一，就是我們要知道那一種方案才可以使國際對於原子能的統制有效。即馬歇爾國務卿所說可以「消滅那毁滅性戰爭的惡魔」的。或者那一種方案是無效的，不過是：「欺騙世界上的人民」的。</p>
<p>削弱國家的安全並遲延治癌等的研究的，無過於任愚昧與政客的組織成爲一種力量，來擺佈科學與科學家。要防止那些無知淺識，自私在枉的人的禍害，最有效的辦法是一個開明的大衆。人民應該當心他們的公僕。但人民要知道眞的事實，他們的見解才有力量。</p>
<p>美國原子能委員會經法律規定，有供給人民大衆以原子能知識的責任。我們希望對於這種責任能够盡善盡忠。在現狀下，有好多關於技術的消息不得不守秘密，並且也防備得極爲週密。委員會對於這一方面自然要盡指導之責，有時便要將這方面的新智識供給大衆。但是有關大衆的問題所有消息已經儘量開放了。</p>
<p>假若一個人要知道一點此較專門的智識，他可以到附近的大學裏去找找。有關公共的問題，大學與中學應該有人將主要事實收集扼要叙述以供公民團體之用。地方圖書館自然也是一個重要的來原。</p>
<p>我希望全國人民對於這與我們休戚相關的問題能了解其事實與觀念。我想將來有一天，大家會懂Geigen測量器，放射同位素，Baruch計劃，Alpha粒，中子吸收，核子反應機等等好像今日之於引擎，X光，長短波，維他命等一些名詞之家喩戶曉。原子能的學問是新的，但新出的書也日在增加，總會有人在寫爲大學中學用的原子能教科書，使這個學間從實驗室中搬到大家的常識中去。</p>
<p>祇有人民大家熱心這個問題，大家了解它的要旨，我們才能免去禍殃，才能得着眞的進步。祗有人民大家研究，大家當心，這種力量才有善果。民治的力量便存在於大衆的良心與良機中。（續完）（譯自紐約時報雜誌一九四八年一月十一日）</p>
<h3 id="c189">鮑桑克論思想與自由 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 質如</p>
<p>若如鮑桑克之意，把思想看作人心健動之全德，那麼牠便包含人類一切有意識的活動，而表現於「有理性的動物之一切的經驗，或每一個經驗之中了。」自由的行為是能收能放，自覺自主的行爲。僅僅身體對於身體的影響，構不成一個有創迭性的人底行爲。作一個主動者是作一個自由因，而不是作一個自然因；這就是說，他要按照他底性質和蘊蓄改造他自己，擴充他自己，衝破他現前的封畛而與天地相通，萬物爲一；把」切陌生的變爲至親的，把表面上不相千的，變為根本上息息相關的：這樣在非我中肯定自我，或者說這樣超越自我與非我底界限而達到一個自全目足的自我，這時的自我便不是自然秩序中的一環，而是超自然的主體了。但要作這樣一個自由的主體，顯然不能任盲目的意欲橫行亂闖，而必須把你底意志滲入希臘哲學家所謂理性，智慧，或鮑桑克所謂思想，而變爲吾國儒者所謂「明德。」</p>
<p>思想與意志自由表面上的不相容，由於把思想看作一種分離的，與人心其他的才能不相干的才能：僅僅抽象推理的理智。在這樣一個分離的看法下，思想不但不能與意志情感不相容，而且和直接經驗的才能，直觀，也分家了；因此理想成了上不能悟道，下不能感物的死東西了。</p>
<p>然而，以鮑桑克看來，抽象的，思索的判斷和推論的程序不足以盡思想底本性。推繹只是思想底一方面。思想還有直觀的一方面。「思想究極的用意不是抽象的槪括，而是去構造一個世界，」這就是說牠不但分析而且綜合，牠不但了別部分，而且要認識部分之間必然的連接，全體底精神。牠不限於感覺底所與，牠要釐定感覺所與底意義而超越現實：由近以及遠，由小以至大，由暗以至明，由塞以至通，由分以至全，由無意義以至有意義，由枯槁以至生動，由呆滯以至活潑，由虧乏以至圓滿，由動盪以至安定，由矛盾以至和諧。所以「思想眞正的職務是建立，是賦予意義，是鼓舞，是活潑。牠底對象不是衰敗的感覺之遺骸，而是一個活的世界。」但是，眞正的思想，固然不限於感覺底所與，却也不離於感覺底所與；固然不溺於現實，却也不遺棄現實；牠只是創新，只是超越，而不是在虛空中建築樓閣。思想底本性就在其由現實出發的自我超越之過程或理想性中。牠之所以能與自由一概念合一也就在這種變生疏爲親近，由非我以肯定自我的這個超越的或擴充的理想性上。因爲自由的行爲正和思想底活動一樣地表現這同一種超越的精神。牠們都是要超越牠們底出發點，而在這超越的活動中得到安頓。非超越不能與大全合一而盡思想與行爲底主體之本性，所以非超越得不到安頓。超越與安頓相輔而行，正如自由與思想之不可分。黑格爾說：「言自由而排斥思想者，乃不自知其所云。」但此處所謂思想乃指聰明睿智的心靈之盧通無礙的功用，與摭拾一編一曲之知，或泥古或趨新，食而不化，固執不通，遂以陷於無底之深淵，萬刃之壁壘，千載不解之縏縛，而終喪其眞正的生命，至死不悟者完全不同。這一點另當別論。</p>

<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>現代歐美思潮（中）</p>
<p>（三）理想主義西洋近代哲學，就其思想方法而論，可分爲二大派，一曰英國派，開創於洛克。一曰大陸派，開創於法人笛卡兒（Descartes　一五九六至一六五〇）至德人康德（Kant　一七二四至一八〇四）而達於極盛。英國派植基於物質科學，貴經驗，尚歸納，就不同的問題，作個別的研討。大陸派以數學爲根據，數學命題係先大的，非由經驗歸納而來，故重純粹思維而輕知覺。英國派信實驗方法，重效果，尚功利。大陸派持理想主義，重動機而斥功利觀念。以學風觀之，英國派趨於細針密樓，大陸派則趨於崇樓傑閣，面目顯然不伺。十八世紀之時代爲英國經驗派所籠罩，因服爾德（Voltairel一六九四至一七七八）之力而傅人法國，又美國建國諸賢亦皆推崇洛克的學說。至十八世紀之末，康德的旗幟乃風靡於歐洲大陸，但英國哲學受其影響甚少。康德相反相成之說實爲黑格爾辯證法的籃本。康德之政治思想與自由主義同聲相應，康德亦謂人之本性自有其目的，而非他人之工具，大爲人權學說張目。康德學說不見容於納粹政府，其故在此。康德以爲全體應比部分重要，準此而談，則戰後聯合國的組織，應該有其崇高的地位。羅素以爲過分注重民族權利，則國際合作爲不可能·理想主義與自由主義的區別在其倫理學，蓋一派重動機，一派重功利。羅素以爲個人窮理之精神，固爲必要，但不可趨於極端，以至於自以爲是。道德不能專講動機，效果亦應顧到。羅素之意，以爲正其義亦須謀其利，明其道亦須計其功。政治上有種種不同之利益，政治家貴能調和折衷於其間，此爲功利主義之要旨，近代社會科學之研究，實由此發輕。</p>
<p>（四）功利主義十九世紀英國之哲學急進派，爲自由主義流派之一·此派以邊沁（Bentham一六四八至一八三二）為健將。當工業革命以後，因機器生產之故，人口集中於都市，發生各種社會問題。邊沁首創最大多數最大幸福之原則，世人稱之爲功利主義。邊沁想以法律來代替宗教，以爲法律與社會制度，其目的都在於調和私利與公益，無法律即無自由可言。他主張廢止貴族，實行全民政治，包括女子的選舉欋。同時有利嘉圖（Riccarco一七七二至一八二三）謂商品之交換價値由於勞工，爲工人運動之興起作理論的前奏。十九世紀以來，英國之社會立法政策，受此派之影響最大。但此派名爲哲學激進派，實際仍爲溫和的革命家，他們一面爲大多數人謀幸福，一面仍爲私有財產作辯護，與主張絕對廢止私產的馬克思主義迴然不同。現在英國工黨所實行的政策，擁護社會正義，力圖世界安全，而於公民基本權利無所侵犯，對於私產僅加以限制而非完全廢止，於經濟平等與政治自由想雙方兼顧。這種英國式的社會主義實在是洛克邊沁以來傳統思想逐步演進的結果。</p>
<p>（五）共產主義共產主義的理論至馬克斯而確立，故又種馬克思主義·馬克思（KarlMarx一八一八至一八八三）誕生於德國而漢寓於英國，其唯物史觀融合德國黑格爾之辯證法與英國經驗派之學說。馬克思所謂物質，指人與物之關係，即生產方式，或經濟生活。馬氏採用黑格爾請證法的公式，但謂推動宇宙之大力，非爲精神而謂物質。馬克思之歷史唯物論，羅素自稱受其影響，謂此中實有至理，但是趨於極端，即有流弊。因社會包括政治，經濟諸多方面，財產僅具一端，凡愈精徵愈專門之問題，經濟原因之作用愈少。馬克思與自由主義者在哲學上之距離並不大，但在實際政治上則有題著的差別。馬克思主義提倡階級戰爭及無產階級專政，揭共產主義之旗幟，竭力主張土地與資本之國有制度，其後經列寗史太林之紹述而見諸實行。一九一九年蘇聯革命，無產階級首次掌握政權，與一般民治之基於私產者顯然異趣。羅素杜威均曾遊歷蘇俄，杜威不贊成馬克思學說，謂其近於神學，國民之與國家好像天主教徒之與教會。至於暴力革命亦爲杜威所反對，謂將流於獨裁。羅素自稱就此點言，彼與杜威具有同感。羅素的宗旨在於兼重政治人權與經濟人權，其於無產階級取政惡其存有非爲主即爲奴的觀念。共產主義最後目的亦在政治與經濟的和諧，但欲實現此種和諧，恐須待諸遙遠的將來。要之，共產主義與浪漫主義雖起源不同，後乃合流而同調，由於思想的激烈，而趨向於政治上的極權主義。但馬克思主張無產階級專政，而無種族上的優越感，這是與尼采一派的不同點。</p>

<p>這還是受了家醜不可外揚的拘泥，孝子孝孫在落筆之際，如何可以唐突先人呢。富蘭克林說過，「把損害寫在泥砂裏，好處寫在大理石上」。十九世紀的人物也許還在「世風日上」的環境中，推繹其意，無非是隱惡揚善的意思。不過假使要看作一種美德的話，應該有一界限，即隱惡揚善的出發點是對人而不是對己。即使是專制時代，天皇老子還要購出一套矇蔽子民的話，「庶人無罪，罪在朕躬」，換一句今日的習語，乃是「檢討自己」。這倒不是美德什麼了，牽涉的還是在於個八的風度與修養。如其富闌克林以上云云，我的估計不錯，該是承平時代對人的態度。若是今日亂世呢，我想應該掉換一下作爲對己的圭臬，即是把好處寫在泥砂裏，損害寫在大理石上。這塊大理石就是你的良知，常常在心理的大理石上摩娑自己的損害，未始不是退思補過的一法。寫文章要盡情暴露，這是對的，不過暴露了人家的，也要反躬暴露一下自己，不要儘管把自己的損書寫在泥砂裘，則等於孝子孝孫的一篇哀啓一樣，使人中途廢卷，未免枉拋心力耳。</p>
<p>就是把好處寫在大理石上也無用處，一旦來個原子彈，不是大理石一下就成爲蕗粉嗎？自己的好處能够寫在人家的心坎裏，這才是光昭日月，永不磨滅的。不過寫在人家心坎裏，需要一點技巧與藝術，這就要看你是如何落筆了。</p>
<h3 id="c192">北美洲的金字塔 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 曹君</p>
<p>假如我說金字塔在北美洲的話，那麼一定有許多人會瞠目驚訝，或許還有許多人會說我的話是錯誤的。的確，金字塔在非洲的埃及附近這句話是沒有人否認的，而且大家也知道埃及第四朝的契奧潑王時建造了一座巨大的金字塔。但自北美的墨西哥起至加拿大南境一帶有着更多的金字塔，而且有一座比契奧潑時的金字塔大一倍有半，雖然高度是不及的。</p>
<p>在墨西哥潘勃拉州的柯羅拉金字塔，它的體積比世界上任何一座是大，甚至比埃及開羅附近吉薩的契奧潑金字塔大百分之一百五十。</p>
<p>在伊烈請斯的東聖路易斯郊外的開奥克亞金字塔，也佔有極廣表的面積。</p>
<p>這些在北美新發現的金字塔被稱爲新金字塔，原是印第安人用泥土或碎石砌成的，因爲在墨西哥高原地及安地斯的沙漠地缺乏石塊，所以才遍普地用泥磗替代了。</p>
<p>新金字塔和埃及的金字塔在基本上的區別是由它們作用的不同。挨及的金字塔都是陵寢而新金字塔都是廟宇之地，所以新金字塔是平頂而不像埃及金字塔的用角式尖頂。新金字塔的附近都由幾個圓錐形的墳墓所環繞着，這些墓冡像埃及的陵室一樣，很早就引起了一般探實者的注意。墓內有各種重價的陶器，介殻，珍珠寶玉…等東西。</p>
<p>印第安人不像埃及人那麼地能發明保留尸體成木乃伊的方法，他們部落中的習俗是把死人身上的肉割去，僅把骨骼置於墓穴中，因此考古學家覺得這些金字塔的建造者不易考據。</p>
<p>在墨西哥之北，這些原始的金字塔都在密士西比河及其支流附近排列着。</p>
<p>開奧克亞金字塔，有大於十六英畝的面積。它的體積共二千一百六十九萬立方呎，它的長度南邊是七百二十一呎，北邊是九百九十八呎，高是九十九呎，是稱爲新金字塔中的「王」。考古學家稱，這新金字塔大約是公元五百年以前建造的。</p>

<p>假如你要選擇幾個好朋友，這是多麼困難的一件事呢！許多朋友嘴裏講得仁義道德，然而當你一旋過身子後，他却會在你背後說讒言，毁謗你，侮辱你。有許多是所謂「酒肉朋友」今天你請他吃喝什麼，他會道你好朋友，親密得可以「刎頸」，但當你明天錢囊告罄後，他便偷倫地溜跑，你如果要向他籌商些錢的話，他竟否認你是他的朋友。有許多朋友是祗能共　難而不能同富貴的，這八年來的抗戰和近三年來的勝利的現象便是一個絕好的例子，在苦難的風雨中，大家「和衷共濟」，大家相互扶助，愛護和同情，但一到情形轉好時就得要「爭權奪利」，「鈎心鬥角」而不能融洽於一爐了。也有許多朋友是祗能共富貴而不能同患離，在昇平的日子中，大家是朋友，然一到大難臨頭時，你要求你朋友一臂之力時，他不再理睬你，各自「分道揚鑣」而分散了。</p>
<p>然而書籍並不是這樣，牠沒有階級觀念，牠也沒時間和空間性的，牠更沒有一切的虛偽和話詐。牠告訴我們世界上的一切知識，人生的目的和眞諦，眞善美的存在。牠會告訴一個貧苦的人所有富人的罪惡和煩惱，伺樣地牠毫不隱蔽地在一個富翁面前痛罵和揭露富人的罪狀。牠會告訴一個苦兒怎樣成功的秘訣，牠也確告一個富家子弟關於他將在某種奢侈的生活中會有一天傾家蕩產，身名俱敗。你可帶牠到南北極或赤道，牠決不會抱怨天氣的酷熱和奇寒；你可以帶牠到草廬茅舍中，也可以帶牠到繁榮的都市中，牠不會鄙視你的寒酸。牠可以終生伴着你，安慰你，引導你。選擇知友是最難不過的事，因爲俗語所謂；「知人知面不知心」。選擇一本好的書是很容易，祇要你肯去選擇，那眞易如反掌了。</p>

<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>前幾日本談戴有許人先生「論批評」一文，細細地品味再三，覺得有許多話想說，便貿然寫上一點意見·</p>
<p>正如許人先生所言：「人孰無過，一個人在數十寒暑中要沒有一件錯失，他一定是自出生時起已經神化了的。」俗語所謂「聖人也有三分錯」者，即是這個意思。但是過錯雖然是誰也免不掉的，却並不可以因其免不掉而寬恕過錯，甚至以爲天下本無所謂過錯，那就大錯特錯了。人類何以能够進步？我想一定是由於能不斷地改過的綠故，孔子所謂「過勿憚改」「不貳過」，有過而能够改善，過失也就成爲進步的原動力，假使有了過失明知而不改，那就是不能或赦的罪惡了。</p>
<p>當局者迷，旁觀者淸，自己要看到自己的過失，總比較困難，這也許便是批評的來由。人雖然都有過失，但並不是說有了過失便失却批評的資格，因爲批評是對事情的是非而言的，縱然「事實上即是在誹議自己的影子」，也沒有什麼不可以，這樣互相切磋，彼此指川雙方的過失，而雙方能够澈底檢討，虛心請益，過失便可以漸漸减少了。</p>
<p>所以我們應多作彼此間善意的批評，建立批評的風氣。何况現在民主國家，首尚有批評的自由，眞理愈拭愈明，讓大家陳述各人的意見，讓大家指摘各人的錯誤，唯有這樣集衆人的意旨來做事，便容易收事半功倍之効。</p>
<p>批評的立塲如何，當然不能純從個人觀點出發，以免容易流於主觀。但也不必要「以對方之立塲爲立塲」，因爲如果拿對方的立而言，同樣的會陷於主觀，譬如今日官塲貪汚，我們如果以食汚者的立塲來想。那末便得出「人皆貪汚，我淸何爲」或「官之貪汚，還是因爲沒有撈飽」的錯誤結論來。我們應該就事而論事，摒棄因人而異的私見，對於錯的不用姑息，當批評的便批評，如果批評錯了，便有接受對批評的勇氣。我們知道批評者不一定要比被批評的才具高，只要有辨別是非的能力就行。例如吃飯時候我們嫌廚司把湯燒得太鹹，菜燒得太淡，我們雖然不會燒菜，但是却能品朱，決沒有廚司放下菜刀鍋子呌我們去試試看的事。要不然世上也沒有所謂評論家了。報上說政府某事有改善的必要，執政的便呌主筆上台來幹；文藝理論家說某小說主題不好，小說家便呌理論家也寫篇小說來看，天下當然不會有這等道理的事。</p>

<p>第十三章　力圖補救　（一〇六）</p>
<p>绮紈說時，不禁傷感，又道；「第二天我不等他開口，開啓首飾匣，檢出兩只鑽石戒指，交給他，並且告訴他，你外面交遊很廣，拿這點東西出去，不過做個意思，換句話說，本不需要的，你姑且帶走好了。他知道我的意思，不願意把東西借給他，只笑了笑，把兩只戒指套在手指上，對我說：你說的對，本不需要，我現找個朋友，一會就可以把東西還你·他一走，我也出去買船票，便趕到上海來。」椅紈說完，又傷心哭起來。柳如聽了這些話，嘆口氣道：「能回來就好了，你也不用傷心，你的前途很遠大的，只要你肯往前幹，很有出路，我最疑心的是，你去這麼多天，爲什麼不給我一封信呀？」綺紈道：「我一到香港就有電報給您，您沒有收到呀？大槪是島雲從中閙鬼了！」柳如道：「這小子，有天他回來，我跟他算賬！現在你回來了，我打算打電報給北平，把你的行頭都寄來，你再幹舞合生活，一定很吃香的。」且說自綺紈到醫院，渚肅探視，寫信都得不到消息，後來又親到綺紈家打聽幾次，一直等綺紈走了，小王媽才私下告訴他，小老板已經離開北平了。渚齊聽了，很是失望，覺得這一回爲了綺紈一人，弄得家庭不睦，夫婦離婚，甚至和雲卿也都疎遠了，現在綺紈已經走了，要補這遺憾，便須和章雲鄉來往，能和她重修前好，再訂良緣，還可彌補這無聊的歲月。渚齋在宿舍裏想了一夜，覺得雲卿這人，面冷心熱，用心極細，這回和鳳笙離婚，她從中奔走，很是賣力，只可惜當時自己顛倒在綺紈一人身上，對她太冷淡了。她是細心的人，若被看出來，那就不好辦了。又想，她一面對我鍾情，這一點小過節也沒關係，現在綺紈已經走了，我跟绮紈要好，她未必能知道淸楚，現在不必胆怯，還是去試探試探。渚齋一顆心旣非越到雲鄉身上，不由自主，一直趕到章宅，來到樓上，見雲卿一人正在屋裏，坐在書桌前織手綫，書桌上面，玻璃板下仍壓着渚齊那張半身的像片。渚齋一看這情形，心裏晴忖，她的心還沒有變，用手在她肩上，微微一拍道：「老太太又上天津去了？」雲卿把身子橄微一側，點一點頭，也不答言。渚齋便坐在她書桌對面，看着她不施脂粉，微帶黄色的臉蛋，頗形憔悴，說道：「你瘦了！」</p>

<p>— 器重</p>
<p>近來物價飛漲，鈔票不値錢，就以大餅而論，十年之前，每個一分錢，現在一張萬元的大鈔，也僅僅祗能換到兩個大餅，換言之，以大餅作標準，就是一萬元的鈔票，僅値十年前的二分錢而已。</p>
<p>但所謂通貨膨脹，不僅見之於現在的中國和歐洲近代，實在在中國是古已有之的。</p>
<p>講到中國的貨幣，最古是毛皮，貝介，以後是珠，王，金，刀，帛，再以後才是銅和鐵的錢。至於鈔票，還是在宋朝才有的。當時宋朝爲了國庫空虛，所以用紙來代替銅錢，那時的紙幣，稱之爲「大宋通行寶鈔」。這便是中國有紙幣的開始。慶歷以後，蜀人得到了官方的允許，發行定期兌現的紙幣，稱之爲「交子」。這種交子，等於現代的匯票，後來因爲信用不足的綠故，所以價値大跌，這就是我國通貨膨脹的開始。</p>
<p>宋朝滅亡，元人入主中國，當時雖有元寶，然而也發行寶鈔，把錢的數目，印在票面之上，而且還印上「庫足兌」三字。但是，後來也因濫發無度，終於把「庫足兌」弄成了不兌現。</p>
<p>明太祖滅去元朝，定都金陵，也發行紙幣，稱之爲「大明通行寶鈔」。當時每貫値金二錢五分。洪武二十二年，又發行一種小額的寶鈔，最小的僅値十文。但是，爲了前車之鑒，恐怕再有像過去一般通貨膨脹的情形，所以明朝就定下了嚴峻的法律，然而，仍是免不掉物重幣輕的情形。後來，爲了邊省的戰事，鈔價還是暴落，於是，宣德就禁止用銀。當時定下一種法律，就是有誰用銀一分，罰錢千貫。到了英宗時代，再重申前令，凡是有誰敢拒收寶鈔的，除了罰錢一萬貫以外，還要全家流戍到邊地去。可是，這種嚴峻的法律，到底不能和事實相對的，結果，到了憲宗時代，已經每貫祗値一錢，差不多等於廢紙了。</p>
<p>一到淸朝，有臨於明朝幣制紊亂情形，所以決定了廢去鈔法，設局專鑄制錢，到了咸豐二年，爲了軍需孔殷，因此又發行銀票與錢票。又設官銀錢號，作爲收兌的機關。但是，各省濫發，流弊極大，因此又制定錢鈔章程。可是，到了同治以後，錢票的信譽又低落了，加了外國人的銀元輸入國中，因此又仿製銀元，籍以維持了錢幣的信用。</p>
<p>到了民國，官商各銀行發行的紙幣很多，那種什麼假鈔之類我們且不去論，然而，民國三年，爲了政局的問題，交通銀行的鈔票，若欲兌現，還要打折扣。這因爲當時硬幣流行，再加中外各銀行都有鈔票，所以僅僅交通票的問題，當還不致影響了通貨的膨脹。</p>
<p>我不是經濟專家，所以祇能敘述一下歷史的陳蹟，讓有識者來參考而想出較好的方法吧！</p>
<h3 id="c198">人體能受熱幾度？ <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>在酷熱的天氣中，人們會揮汗如雨，但是人體到底能忍受多少熱度呢？假使把一個人放在足够燒熟鷄蛋的爐子中，又會產生怎樣的後果？</p>
<p>這一個問題尤其在航空發展的今日，尤其重要。如果一架每小時飛行六百哩的噴射式飛機，它的冷凝器突然損壞了，那麼空氣的壓縮與磨擦，將使機艙內產生一種難受的悶熱，甚至於可能像一個火爐一樣，因此，空軍必須知道一個機員能忍受多少熱度？在多少時間內，皮膚不致炙傷，或者內臟受損。</p>
<p>爲了護得這個答案，美國洛杉磯的加里福尼亞大學教授泰勒博士，作了一個有趣的實驗：他把他自己關在一個特製的「熱盒」中加熱，在他的座位前安置一個金屬盤，盤中放了一個鷄蛋，就這樣的熱到華氏二百二十度，鷄蛋已自動的煮熟了，然而泰勒竟忍坐到二十五分鐘之久，雖然汗珠頻流，但是除了心臟跳動加速（從每分鐘八十二跳激增至一六二跳）以外，並無其他顯著者的反應發生，當然，經過這樣一個消耗能量的試驗後，像一個激烈的運動比賽一樣，人的疲憊是不可避免的，而體重的减輕若干也是必然的事。</p>
<p>據泰勒傳士的報告，人體能忍受溫度的最高記錄是華氏二六二度，在普通的情形下，水也已沸了，然而人體構造的玄妙，却造成這個奇怪的現象。</p>
<h3 id="c199">西名漢譯 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>西人名姓譯作華式名姓，其例甚多，若論典雅莊嚴，旣耐尋味，又資考證，則以今北美合衆國駐華大使「司徒合登」爲最。</p>
<p>大使姓名的原文是JohnLeighton　Stuart，若照音譯全，則其共名（Surname即姓名Stuart即可譯「司徒華爾脫一或司徒阿院」，其二名之一John例譯「約翰」（此譯音並不甚準確而相沿已久，如「聖約翰書院」St．John＇ｓ　College，約翰孫醫士Dr．Johnson皆是），又一名Leighton即是「雷登」。合共八九音，即八九字之多。删節自是當然。（編者譯：此節凌霄先生恐微有誤，因司使實係複姓Leighton　Stuart也。）惟於姓之四五音中截留二音（司徒），恰合於中國舊有之雙姓，此一妙也。從來西譯姓名，皆只取原姓一字，分爲華文二三字，以合乎中國姓名之格，如邱吉爾原只一姓，而其字全音則非中國一字（一音）所能盡，中國姓一字一音，則邱吉爾便像姓「邱」，名「古爾」，則其名Winston等字，可完全置之不顧矣。又如羅斯福，姓也，非名也，然旣爲漢文，便是有姓有名之三字，而西文原名之Franklin云云用不着矣。「華萊士」三字已够姓名格，則Wallace可留用，而Henry可删矣。史太林已够姓「史」名「太林」的格局，則Josef等名可去矣。凡西名譯華，多是如此，不勝枚舉，隨處可見。惟「司徒雷登」不然。</p>
<p>若照上述及一般的譯法，只用一姓Stuart即是「司徒華脫』，有姓有名。大使則打破常例，獨運匠心，於Stuart一字只取其半，是爲『司徒」，於兩名亦只取其一，是爲「雷登」。合成複姓「司徒」名「雷登」之式，有氣槪有規模，形聲俱美，此又一妙也。中國古代複姓甚多，三國之司馬懿，司馬徽，諸葛亮，夏侯淵，唐之歐陽詢，朱之歐陽修，皆昭昭在人耳目。明淸及今單姓多，雙姓少，「司徒」之姓偶然可見，我在北大時同學中尚有二「司徒」，皆廣東人。現在華北複姓名人，最著者乃上官雲相（剿匪副總司令之一），而「司徒雷登」與「上官雲相」之字面對仗工穩，音調協調，位分相等（一個是中華將軍，一個是北美大使），眞是「巧相逢」的佳話。二公取名時未必預料到此，此又一妙也。（美國名人魏德邁將軍，周以德議員，蒲立德大使，都有很好的華名。）</p>
<p>英國現任首相譯名，原爲「阿特利」，近一年來則改爲「艾德禮」，聞係彼方提出修改，足見西人對於華文之進步的認識，及其對於華式姓名與味之濃厚。蓋此公原名第一個字母是A，其音可以譯「阿」，亦可以譯「艾」。惟「艾德禮」比較冠冕堂皇（艾姓出春秋大夫艾孔，「德禮」則四書上「道之以德，齊之以禮」皆是格言）。</p>
<p>美國現任「杜魯門」總統之名，在兩年以前原譯「特魯受」，若以音論之，前譯較近，因其原文第一字母是T，合「特」字音，其第二第三字母RU合「魯」字音，第四五六字母Man則合「曼」字音。自比「杜魯門」三字爲準。但「杜魯門」儼與中國詩聖杜少陵同宗，而「門」字平聲亦較「曼」字沉著協調。T與RU聯讀協「杜魯」二音，亦頗妥適自然。（阿特利及特魯曼皆似舊時旗人姓名）</p>
<p>西人譯名何以只須取其一姓，即可變爲華式之連姓帶名。舊時旗人之姓何以不著，而慣以其名之第一字作爲姓？皆有一定的自然原則。明乎此原則，一切自可迎刃而解。原則爲何？即Law　of　Meter（音度律），人類語言之頓逗，以二音至三音Syllable爲最自然而舒適，不宜多於三，或少於二。西文字體雖長短不齊，而若以Syllable爲標準，即可發現中西之共同點。</p>
<p>華文一字一音，而一尺度之音程（西文謂之foot）不能多過二，或少過二，故華人之姓名，無論爲兩字（如胡適，孫科之音，皆不少於二），或三字（如潘公展，何敬之音不多於三），皆合自然的音度之原則，所以幾千年的歷史，二十餘省的同胞，幾萬萬億億的中國人，名姓皆是此式，豈古人與今人，有預約之可能乎？非也。豈歷代法律有此規定乎？亦非也。一言以蔽之曰：不約而同的受着自然律之支配而已。</p>
<p>西人譯名，只以其姓作爲連名帶姓，故不用原名。旗人之漢名則以其名作爲連名帶姓，而不用原姓。兩者恰恰相反，而有同一之作用，乃富於研究興味之事，今舉一例，如：僞滿國皇「溥儀」兩字爲一名，其姓爲「愛辛覺羅」，若按規矩，應說姓「愛辛覺羅」名「溥儀」，字「浩然」。但一姓有許多字，太羅瑣不堪，故其居津時登報捐賑，只說「溥浩然」，便是姓「溥名儀字浩然」，何等乾凈，其姓（譯音四字之長姓）置之不提矣。崑曲家紅豆館主溥侗亦只稱溥厚齊，其人善演周瑜，戲塲上例報名「姓周名瑜字公瑾」，故若將來紅豆館主編入戲中報名，亦只是「姓溥名侗字厚齊」，決不用「姓愛立覺羅名溥侗字厚齊」也。又如淸光緒末年之兩江總督「端方」，人稱「端午帥」，其貼告示及行文書亦標姓爲「端」，實則姓「托活絡」，亦是譯音羅瑣無用，故就其名「端方」，取一字「端」爲姓。另一字「方」爲名。字曰「午橋」。（端又字陶齊，據說最早是漢裔陶氏，此爲另一系統，過費考據，今不置論。）</p>
<p>人要姓不要名，旗人要名不要姓。西人　姓即可成功漢式姓名，旗、一名亦可成功漢式姓名，殊途而同歸。可見漢式姓名實爲古今中外之模範，其所以能成爲姓名之公式，決非偶然，原因在合於人類口中天然的音度。</p>

<p>金華豐先生仍本其過去的慷慨風度，獨力捐助了這筆龐大的款項。由於幣値的變遷，和生活程度的不斷高漲，我們可以預料到「貧婦助產」運動的將來，一定是相當艱難和困苦的。但是我們不願看見無數的貧窮產婦遭受到經濟壓迫，和疾病的侵襲，我們只有在報端向熱心讀者，作一個緊急的呼籲。希望大家能够慷慨的捐輸，勿加重金先生一人的負担，而使這個運動永遠的延展下去，爲貧窮的產婦們造福。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Since the government stipulated the methods for remitting funds and transporting cash to Shanghai and Guangzhou from various places, banks and money shops in other cities often open "Type A current accounts" and handle remittances by check.

In the future, any bank or money shop that handles remittances by check with counterparts in other cities must be cracked down on. The issuance of long-term checks by various banks and shops for remittance purposes is also prohibited. The Ministry of Finance issued this order on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Hu Shih Discusses His Views on the Current Situation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Hu Shih, President of Peking University, spoke to reporters yesterday about his views on the current situation. His view is: "Peace is more difficult than war." He elaborated, saying: "Peace requires all kinds of determination, requiring both wisdom, benevolence, and courage, especially requiring mutual tolerance and sacrifice from all sides, so peace is very difficult, while war is easy. Carelessness can lead to war. The large and small wars in history all prove that "peace is more difficult than war," with very few exceptions. General Marshall, as one of the supreme commanders of the Allied forces, defeated Germany and Japan, and can be called a victorious general. He came to China to preside over peace talks, but failed, as expected. This is the best example. Many people do not understand this, and often ask why there is no peace. This is because they do not understand the difficulty of peace."</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Moral Foundation of Freedom of the Press: Opening of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information opened today in Geneva, the "World Country." Five or six hundred famous reporters, political commentators, and government representatives from all over the world gathered together to discuss the theory and practice of freedom of the press at length, and will formulate an international charter of freedom of the press, a code for the press in all countries to follow. This conference is an unprecedented international conference in the history of the world's press, and it is also related to the well-being and continued benefits of our own journalists, so it is naturally worthy of our attention. As it opens, we, standing in the position of the newspaper industry, cannot but express our views slightly for the reference of the representatives of various countries.</p>
<p>The international freedom of the press movement emerged during the Second World War. When the war was in full swing, people all over the world suffered the cruel lessons of the war, and they all hoped that this war would be the last war of mankind, but to achieve this goal, domestic democracy and international understanding in all countries are indispensable, so the international freedom of the press movement was advocated. The so-called "freedom of the press" includes freedom of speech and freedom of news gathering, transmission, and publication. Therefore, this movement has a dual meaning, internal and external. In other words, internally, it requires the government not to interfere with freedom of speech and news gathering, transmission, and publication, so that public opinion can be fully expressed directly, and indirectly so that all government policies are based on public opinion, so as to promote the realization of domestic peace and democracy. As for the external aspect, it is to strive for international freedom of the press. As long as they are current journalists, they can go to any country to engage in news gathering without being interfered with by the government of the host country, and the transmission of the news they gather is also not subject to the inspection of the government of the host country. This will eliminate international misunderstandings, enhance understanding between countries, and prevent any form of secret diplomacy from being carried out in secret, resulting in international wars. Therefore, the international freedom of the press movement after the war is actually a movement to end war through ideas. The late US President Roosevelt attached importance to "freedom of speech and expression" and listed it as the first of the "Four Freedoms" he advocated, and this is also the reason for it.</p>
<p>The convocation of this United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information dates back to December 14, 1946, when the United Nations General Assembly had already passed a resolution declaring freedom of the press as one of the basic human rights and a touchstone for all freedoms. Later, on August 15, 1947, the fifth meeting of the Economic and Social Council made more concrete decisions and designated the Freedom of Information Subcommittee of the Human Rights Commission to be responsible for studying the concept of freedom of the press. In December of this year, all parties actively proceeded to discuss the agenda and declaration outline that the Conference on Freedom of Information should adopt. Although the opinions of all parties were not consistent, they decided on four main points in principle: (1) Freedom of the press includes the right to freedom of thought and speech without interference, and to seek, accept, and transmit news by all means and without boundaries. (2) It is very important to maintain, enhance, and distribute scientific and intellectual knowledge, and to promote public education and cultural dissemination. (3) Journalists have the right to go to the source of news by all possible means, and shall not be obstructed in any way during travel. (4) Freedom of the press and freedom of publication are also attached with obligations and responsibilities.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the so-called freedom of the press is not complete freedom, without limitations. As the Chinese saying goes, "Two words can build a nation, one word can destroy a nation." A reporter's pen, whether recording news or writing articles, expressing opinions, must be cautious. According to the resolution of the Freedom of Information Subcommittee, the following events will be treated as exceptions to freedom of the press: (1) Events that must be kept secret for national security; (2) Speech that incites others to change the government system by violence; (3) Speech that directly incites others to commit crimes; (4) Obscene speech; (5) Speech that is harmful to fair legal proceedings; (6) Speech that infringes on literary and artistic property rights; (7) Speech that damages the reputation of others or is harmful to others and not beneficial to the public. The Chinese delegation attached particular importance to this issue and repeatedly called the attention of the delegates of various countries. Because individual freedom cannot harm the freedom of others, let alone harm the interests of the entire society, country, and nation. This principle has become a common principle observed by all countries, and freedom of the press is no exception. The subcommittee also drafted four basic principles that journalists should abide by: (1) Report based on facts, without prejudice; disseminate what is known, without malice. (2) Freely exchange news about world economic, social, and humanitarian issues to facilitate the solution of these issues. (3) Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, regardless of race, gender, language, or religion, and should try to eliminate any harm to this, and should fight against any ideology that endangers such freedom and rights. (4) Seek mutual understanding and cooperation among all nations to maintain world peace, and at the same time eradicate all war-mongering and potential forces that incite war.</p>
<p>These four basic principles, in theory, are extremely perfect, but in practice, it is not easy to find a reporter who has these four conditions. Taking the current situation in China as an example, foreign journalists who come to China to gather news are given a high degree of freedom and convenience, whether in gathering or transmitting news, which is no less than any country in the world. Moreover, there are also newspapers and news agencies run by foreign journalists, newspapers have absolute freedom of speech, and news agencies have no restrictions on sending telegrams and manuscripts. The ideal of freedom of the press</p>
<h3 id="e30">Shanghai Conscription Lottery to be Held Today <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The annual conscription is about to begin in Shanghai, and the city is actively preparing for it. At 3:00 PM today, the city's military service administrative agencies and various public organizations will hold this year's indirect conscription lottery ceremony at the City Council. Regarding the method of drawing lots, it is said that the total number of conscripts assigned will be drawn from all eligible young men. Those who are drawn will not be immediately conscripted. When there are vacancies in the voluntary soldier registration, the drawn young men will be conscripted into the camp according to the order of the lottery numbers. This method is fair and reasonable, and it complies with the spirit of the Military Service Law, and it also facilitates the environment of Shanghai's first conscription lottery. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai will recognize the importance of military service and that the lottery is a necessary step for conscription, and that there will be no slightest illusion in their minds.</p>
<p>Serving in the military is a duty that citizens should fulfill, and it is also a right that citizens should enjoy. People with a sense of responsibility should have the concept of defending the country and protecting their hometown. Not only should they take the lead in serving in the military, but they should also persuade their children and neighbors to serve in the military, in order to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. Now the entire world has entered an extraordinary period. European and American countries are actively preparing for military mobilization and universal military training for the people. The northern provinces of China are feeling the cruel destruction of the Communist bandits, the peaceful environment has been destroyed, local security and order are threatened, and the people's happiness and the cultivation of the land have lost good protection. At this critical juncture, in order to defend the country and protect our hometown, military mobilization is indeed very necessary and cannot be delayed. If there is no military mobilization, the national defense force cannot be established, and the local armed forces cannot be established. Therefore, citizens with a sense of responsibility understand the significance of military mobilization, and citizens who love their hometown and local area must be enthusiastic about serving the country or supporting the implementation of military service. Shanghai has only been handling military service for one year, and most people do not have enough understanding of the Military Service Law. Most people, especially, do not understand the relationship between military mobilization and national security and local security. It can be said that it has been fully realized in China. But experience tells us that the newspapers run by foreign journalists—even the Chinese-language newspapers they run—often publish words that violate the interests of our nation and country. Foreign news agencies also often distort facts and publish inaccurate news when reporting news, which has an adverse impact on China's international reputation, or deliberately provokes the feelings between China and friendly countries. We have to lodge a complaint with the Freedom of the Press Conference? Ask the delegates of all countries to fully understand the position of our delegation that the international freedom of the press system must be based on the foundation of national press ethics.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to call on the citizens to pay fresh and strong attention and high vigilance to this important matter of government on the day of the conscription lottery.</p>
<p>The total quota for this year's conscription in Shanghai is 6,000, which is only slightly more than one-thousandth of the total population of 5 million. The conscription of these 6,000 soldiers will be carried out in combination with voluntary soldiers and conscription, which is not something that can be done in one go. The formal conscription fully takes into account the local environment of Shanghai. Voluntary soldiers are those who voluntarily serve in the military according to their own wishes and do not need to be forced; conscripts are those who are conscripted and serve in the military according to the provisions of the Military Service Law. The so-called eligible men refer to men who are 20 years old or older. All men who are fully 20 years old or men who are 21 to 25 years old have the obligation to be conscripted for military service according to the law. The lottery presided over by the military service agency today uses the roster of eligible men compiled based on the household survey and exemption applications handled last year, and under the supervision of various public organizations and public opinion, uses indirect methods to draw out who will serve in the military and the order in which they will serve, in order to be conscripted into the camp when the number of voluntary soldiers is insufficient. This method is fair and reasonable, and it is not favoritism or perfunctory. It is very much in line with the three principles of equality, fairness, and average. If the handling of the results is good, it will definitely establish a good atmosphere.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the allocation of Shanghai's 6,000 military quotas after conscription, the City Council suggested that the principle of local training to protect Shanghai's security should be followed, and at the same time, it passed a resolution to establish the Songhu Garrison Brigade, and has already jointly sent a telegram to the Central Government with the local community to allocate the 6,000 military quotas to the brigade for service. This suggestion is based on the concept of protecting the local area, based on protecting the safety of the majority, and even more based on protecting the metropolis that is the source of national wealth. Calling on ambitious youths, talented people, and people with lofty ideals to bravely join the army and participate in this movement to defend the country and protect their hometown, we cannot express our good suggestions and hope that the central government will adopt them.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Press Conference Aboard the Xing'an Ship; Gui Yongqing Reports on the Acquisition Process, Xu Shifu, Ship Captain <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 22nd on the Xing'an, a repair ship recently returned from the United States. Gui and ship captain Xu Shifu successively reported on the acquisition process of the ship. Briefly stated: The transfer of the ship was based on the agreement between the Chinese and American governments in Nanjing on December 8 of last year in accordance with the United States 79th Congress No. 511 Act and the Executive Order No. 9842 issued by President Truman on April 25, 1947 (agreement on the transfer of ships). Ninety-nine officers and soldiers (sixteen officers and eighty-three soldiers) were assigned to the ship. Captain Xu Shifu took the U.S. Navy transport ship "General Breckenridge" from Qingdao to the United States on June 19 of last year, and handled the acquisition matters at the Port of New Orleans. The ship was originally named "Achilles" (repair ship), and began service in the Pacific in January 1943. During the island battles, it was seriously damaged twice during the landings on Buna Island in New Guinea and Leyte Island in the Philippines. After all the difficulties faced by our ship officers and soldiers, it was repaired after four months. During the voyage back home, it was repaired twice in San Francisco and Pearl Harbor, and arrived in the capital on the 19th of this month. According to reports: The Xing'an ship is 328 feet long, 50 feet wide, has a full load displacement of 3,319 tons, a draft of 13 feet, and a speed of 10 knots. It was originally a tank landing craft and was later converted into a repair ship for repairing infantry landing ships. Gui also expressed his admiration to the soldiers for their perseverance in overcoming difficulties, turning decay into magic, and completing the mission of acquiring the ship. Captain Xu expressed his deep indignation at the fact that unscrupulous people repeatedly slandered China's new navy and affected the reputation of the group. According to reports: When the ship arrived in the capital, officers and soldiers were only allowed to leave the ship after being observed by the acting commander-in-chief. However, rumors claimed that it carried a large number of private goods, which was a complete fabrication. Xu strongly appealed to the media to report fairly and clear up the matter. The first task of the ship after returning home is to be sent to the Philippines to repair the American ships moored there waiting to be received, and will be dismantled and utilized, or towed to the Kaohsiung shipyard for repairs. Once the passport procedures are completed, it will set off.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing: On its way back to China, the "Xing'an" received a warm welcome from overseas Chinese in various places, and when passing through Japan, it brought back 477 boxes of zinc plates of Chinese military maps made by the Japanese during the war, which were very valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e32">New York Times Publishes: Zhang Junmai Explains the Status of Minority Parties <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The New York Times today published a long letter from Zhang Junmai, leader of China's National Socialist Party, clarifying the status of minority parties in China's government. He appealed to the American people for sympathetic understanding of China's situation in a moving tone. Zhang emphasized the following points: (1) Transforming a country with a population of 450 million and a long history of political habits into a modern democratic country is indeed an extraordinarily difficult task. (2) The Kuomintang's voluntary abandonment of one-party dictatorship is an extremely important and novel development. No modern dictatorial regime has ever taken this step. (3) The Communist Party should be responsible for the early breakdown of peace talks and the current civil unrest. (4) The reason why minority parties cooperate with the Kuomintang to produce the National Assembly and establish democracy is that although China cannot have peace due to the Communist Party, there is no reason to abandon democracy at the same time. (5) The people responsible for the Nanjing government are no less than their counterparts anywhere in the world in terms of honesty and integrity. (6) As far as the National Socialist Party is concerned (and I believe the Youth Party is the same), we will continue to work hard until the foundations of China's modern democracy are firmly established. (7) The results of this election are gratifying. Many non-party and non-factional people were elected. What is gratifying is that although they belong to the Kuomintang, they were freely elected by the people and not elected under the coercion of organized groups. According to reports, the New York Times published a report by its correspondent in China, Sai Dianan, on March 7, which criticized the minority party members in the Chinese government. Zhang wrote this letter to respond to it.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Group of our mission in Japan plans to repatriate 2,000 unemployed overseas Chinese residents to the country within this year, most of whom are Taiwanese compatriots who were conscripted by the Japanese military during the war to work as laborers. After Japan's surrender, they engaged in the restaurant business. However, due to the food shortage in Japan, all overseas Chinese restaurants were closed down, and they became unemployed. Our mission in Japan originally planned to use ships coming to Japan to transport reparations materials to repatriate them, but the Chinese shipping companies insisted that their ships were for cargo transportation and not for passengers, so this plan could not be implemented. Lin Dingping, the head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Group, told the Central News Agency reporter today that the mission has submitted a request to the domestic government to send a ship here within this year to undertake the repatriation work. He estimates that in addition to the ship's transportation costs, at least 3 billion legal tender will still be needed as living subsidies for this group of repatriated overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>Shandong River Defense Department Prepares for Emergency Repairs</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 22nd] According to a telegram from Heze: The flow of the Yellow River is abusing downstream, heading straight from Houji on the north bank to Jia Village and Lei Village on the south bank, and the collapse is severe, which is quite dangerous. It is found that Jia Village belongs to Heze County and is located eight li downstream from the border of Hebei and Shandong. Before and after the tenth year of the Republic, it was a famous dangerous engineering project. In the past 20 years, due to the upstream raising of the flow, the protection has gradually become sparse. Now the flow has changed abruptly and is directly impacting the area. If there is an accident, not only will western Shandong and northern Jiangsu become a swamp, but the traffic on the Longhai and Jinpu Railways will be interrupted. The Shandong River Defense Department is actively preparing to go to the site for emergency protection, but the local bandits are unpredictable, and construction will not be without difficulties.</p>

<p>(Continued from page one) Mr. Li continued to answer several questions from reporters, with the following main points: (1) Regarding expanding the foundation of the government, he advocated that in the future, whether it is the central government or local governments, they should recruit talents regardless of party affiliation and implement the Three Principles of the People. (2) Regarding his own nomination for the vice-presidential election, it is not yet known whether it will be nominated by the National Assembly delegates or by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, but he does not mind if he cannot obtain the nomination. (3) Regarding American aid to China, he agreed with MacArthur's view that military aid is more urgently needed than economic aid. As for how much American aid is needed to improve the current situation, he could not give a specific answer. The main thing is still our own self-reliance. (4) It is rumored that Ambassador Stuart supports his candidacy for vice president, but because he has not met with the ambassador recently, he does not know. However, the ambassador and he have a very close personal relationship.</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Li had to visit his friends in the city, and the reception ended. He then distributed enlarged photographs of himself to the reporters present. At 8:00 PM, local associations and other groups in the city held a banquet at 1105 Linsen Middle Road. Mr. Li is scheduled to hold a banquet at the International Hotel at noon today to thank all sectors of society, and will fly to Nanjing in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Written Statement Mr. Li's written statement on his feelings about the election is as follows: "The National Assembly of this session will soon open in the capital, and the president and vice president will be elected by the assembly. The popularly elected legislators will also convene on their own, and the new government established in accordance with the Constitution will be established at that time. This is truly a new era in the history of our country. However, the effectiveness of constitutional implementation does not lie in the clauses and forms of the Constitution, but in possessing the spirit of constitutionalism. The spirit of constitutionalism is the soul of constitutional government. If we do not have the sincerity to create a truly constitutional government for the country, then all measures will inevitably become a formality, wasting public funds in vain. The National Assembly of this session should make the election of the president and vice president its primary task. President Chiang is widely expected and supported by the entire country, so there is no doubt about his election. As for my motivation for participating in the vice-presidential election, it is based on promoting a democratic atmosphere and a sense of responsibility to both families. Because in the past, the general public was mostly uninterested in politics, and even virtuous and capable people often prided themselves on being aloof and disdained to participate in actual politics. Therefore, political reform was difficult to achieve and also went against the spirit of democratic politics. The purpose of my participation in this election is to promote a democratic atmosphere and encourage everyone to participate in politics with enthusiasm. Personal gains and losses are insignificant. However, if elected, I will use my decades of experience in military and political work to assist the head of state, promote political reform, strengthen military forces, and especially implement economic policies based on the Principle of People's Livelihood to stabilize society and win people's hearts. This is the only way to resolve the national crisis today and has been my consistent proposition for many years. Even if the election fails, I will continue to work for the realization of this proposition. Recently, the international situation has become increasingly critical. At this critical juncture, we must strengthen ties with friendly countries and strive for foreign aid. However, people must help themselves before others will help them. Therefore, we must work hard to govern the country, strive for self-improvement, and only then can we talk about striving for foreign aid."</p>

Informed sources said on the 21st that it is expected that the US will take action in the United Nations Security Council after the Western countries announced the return of the Port of Trieste, so that the matter of allowing Italy to join the United Nations will be voted on immediately. The Soviet Union has so far vetoed Italy's participation because the US refuses to allow the former Balkan enemy countries to join the United Nations. If the Soviet Union uses its veto again before the April elections, the Italian Communist Party will suffer a serious blow. The office of Secretary of State Marshall said "no comment" on this rumor. However, no one denies that the US and France may raise the matter again. At the same time, diplomatic experts agree that in modern world history, there has never been such a fierce competition between two major countries caused by an internal election in one country as this time. Therefore, when the Italians vote, they are choosing the US or the Soviet Union. The acuteness of the issue has evolved to such an extent. The US and its Western European allies wrested the initiative in the "Cold War" from the Soviet Union on Saturday and announced their support for the return of the port of Trieste and its hinterland to Italy. In terms of the disposal of Italian colonies, the Soviet Union has already defeated the West. Several weeks ago, the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to support Italy in obtaining trusteeship of its former colonies. France agreed to the Soviet proposal, while the UK did not dare to agree due to its wartime promises to Arab countries. The US still believes that its European Recovery Program is the best trump card. Marshall has warned the Italians twice that if the Communist Party is strong, it will not be able to benefit from the program. The return of the port of Trieste is clearly another card in the current high-stakes poker game, as no one in the three Western countries believes that Italy has a reason to obtain the entire Trieste. It is reported that the Western countries acted quickly this time in order to buy time to prevent similar actions by the Soviet Union, as secret reports from Moscow indicate that the Soviet Union had planned similar tactical compromise solutions.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Port of Trieste Returns to Italy; Full Text of Declaration by Britain, America, and France; US Asks Security Council to Approve <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[US News Service Washington 21st] The US, Britain, and France yesterday proposed that the Free Territory of Trieste, which was created by the Italian Peace Treaty, be returned to Italy. The three governments issued a joint statement requesting the Soviet Union, in its capacity as a signatory to the Italian Peace Treaty, to agree to add a draft treaty to the treaty authorizing the return of this territory. The joint statement stated: The three countries are taking this action because the United Nations Security Council, which was entrusted with selecting the Governor of the Free Territory of Trieste, has failed to complete this selection, and because Yugoslavia has taken "various measures hindering the operation of this decree" in the Trieste region it occupies. A copy of this statement has been submitted to the embassies of Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and Italy here. The statement said that in view of these circumstances, returning Trieste to Italy would be "the best solution to satisfy the democratic aspirations of the people and make it possible for the region to rebuild peace and stability." Shortly after the announcement was made, the US Representative to the United Nations, Austin, submitted this proposal to Secretary-General Lai at the United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success in New York, requesting the Security Council to approve it. The joint proposal of Britain, America, and France to return the port of Trieste to Italy, the original text of the joint declaration issued by the State Department is as follows: The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have suggested to the governments of the Soviet Union and Italy that the above-mentioned three governments have agreed on an agreement, advocating that a protocol be attached to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, so that the Free Territory of Trieste will once again be placed under Italian sovereignty. The governments of Britain, America, and France made this decision because discussions in the Security Council have shown that it is impossible to reach an agreement to select a governor, and they have obtained sufficient evidence that Yugoslavia has completely changed its nature and has largely been incorporated into Yugoslavia, and the procedures it has gone through do not respect the wishes of the great powers to grant the region independent and democratic status. When the Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the Italian Peace Treaty, the representatives of the US, Britain, and France insisted on the original position that Trieste, which has a clear majority of Italian population, must continue to be an Italian city. Since the three governments know that it is impossible to realize this decision, they have agreed to establish the city and a small inland area as a free zone. And they hope that the district is placed in such a situation, that through the cooperation of the parties concerned, to ensure the independence of the people of the district (including the city of Italian Trieste). Before the governor took office, the free zone was administered by the commanders of the British and American troops in the north, and by the commanders of the Yugoslav troops in the south. In the British-American zone, the British and American military authorities will appoint the appointed governor and representatives of democratic institutions. At the same time, Yugoslavia, under its supervision in the southern district, took steps to hinder the possibility of implementing the status of the district. Under these circumstances, the three governments have reached a conclusion that the current solution cannot guarantee the maintenance of the basic rights and interests of the people of the Free Territory of Trieste. Therefore, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have decided to recommend the return of the sovereignty of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy, and regard it as the best solution to satisfy the democratic aspirations of the people and make it possible for the region to rebuild peace and stability. Since the Security Council is responsible for the independence and territorial integrity of the Free Territory of Trieste, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will submit the joint plan to the Security Council and request it to approve it.</p>
<h3 id="e57">America to Soon Release Anti-Totalitarian Manifesto, Possible Troop Deployment to Europe <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] The State Department or the White House is about to release a manifesto based on Secretary of State Marshall's proposed plan to support anti-totalitarian resistance movements. One point to be mentioned will be the issue of returning former Italian colonies to Italy. Marshall seems to be concentrating his efforts on assisting Italians who wish to prevent the Communists from winning the general election on April 18th. Truman and Marshall have both made it clear that this strategy will be part of a larger strategy to prevent the Soviet Union from controlling all of Europe. Analyzing Marshall's speeches over the past ten days, four basic principles can be derived: (1) The United States cannot agree to changes in the state of Europe through force or threats, rather than reasonable democratic processes; (2) The United States will automatically cease all economic aid to any government that falls under Communist control; (3) Although the United States recognizes the development of Europe as part of a global struggle between freedom and tyrannical forces, it will currently focus its efforts on Europe; (4) The United States is determined to support its foreign policy with all its resources. The United States will strengthen its military position and provide greater support to free countries resisting oppression. Although there has been no explicit statement regarding the military responsibilities of the United States in Europe, leading American diplomatic journalists have stated that the United States is prepared to deploy troops to Europe if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Soviet Radio Commentary: Criticism of Proposal to Return Trieste Intensified Against the United States <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] The Soviet Union today condemned the return of Trieste to Italy as a measure by Western allies, especially the United States, to interfere in the Italian elections. The Moscow Radio broadcast first expressed its opposition to the three countries' revision of the Italian peace treaty, saying that the British, American, and French countries were "plotting behind the Soviet Union's back." However, the broadcast strongly avoided the question of whether the Soviet Union would accept or reject it. The broadcast stated that the proposals of Britain, the United States, and France had not received the heartfelt welcome of the Italian people. The broadcast directly pointed out that the main purpose of the proposals of Britain, the United States, and France was to induce Italian voters to vote for reactionary parties that are agents of the United States, rather than truly considering the interests of the Italian people. After the above commentary, Moscow Radio broadcast a lengthy speech by the leader of the Italian Communist Party in Rome, Togliatti, denouncing Marshall's plan.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Soviet Union Asks Berlin Control Authority to Stop Allied Control Council Activities, General Clay Says Americans Will Never Leave Berlin <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Soviet control authorities in Berlin have notified Allied representatives today that meetings of the Allied Control Council's subcommittees will be postponed indefinitely. This act is tantamount to declaring the cessation of the Allied Control Council's activities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces, commented on the events in Berlin, saying: "We came to Berlin based on our rights, and we are determined to stay in Berlin. The intentions of the Soviet Union are currently unknown. We must wait a few days to grasp the true meaning of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Allied Control Council. If the Soviet Union continues to refuse to participate in the activities of the Four Powers, I do not believe that world history will undergo a very adverse change. The Berlin Allied Control Council has not achieved much in the past year. I do not understand how the Soviet Union's postponement of meetings can be more effective in preventing affairs than participating in meetings. In any case, the Americans will not withdraw from Berlin before the signing of a peace treaty with Germany. We came here by right, and the entire strength of the United States will be our backing."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Lieutenant General Robertson, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces, recently issued a written statement to the Germans, instructing them not to believe rumors, pointing out that rumors such as the Soviet Union demanding that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin within two weeks are only intended to disrupt the Germans' nerves. Lieutenant General Robertson solemnly assured the Germans that, regardless of any propaganda techniques, Berlin will continue to be a city under the joint administration of the Four Powers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The highest authorities here believe that the Soviet Union is preparing official documents to be submitted to the British and American representatives, demanding that Britain and the United States withdraw from Berlin immediately. The documents will likely state that "since the Allied Control Council has indefinitely postponed meetings, British and American representatives no longer need to reside in Berlin." (Editor's note: When rumors of the Soviet Union demanding the withdrawal of the Allied forces from Berlin first emerged a month ago, General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces, stated at a press conference, "We have no intention of leaving Berlin. We will continue to stay in Berlin for as long as we deem necessary.") Observers believe that if the Soviet Union continues to implement the policies pursued by Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces, when he withdrew from the Allied Control Council meetings, a new and dangerous crisis will occur in Anglo-American-Soviet relations.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] The Finnish delegation that came to the Soviet Union to negotiate a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance arrived in Moscow on the 22nd. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky personally welcomed them at the station.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 21st] Observers here on the night of the 21st believed that there was little doubt that the Finnish delegation, which arrived in Moscow on the 22nd, would conclude a military assistance pact proposed by Premier Stalin. These observers include several people who have close ties to the Finnish government. The notification they received from the Finnish government before departing on the night of the 20th indicated that the Finnish negotiators had been ordered to sign a treaty identical to those recently signed by the Soviet Union with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. It is understood that the delegation was only ordered to request clarification of the content and explanation of the meaning of certain clauses before signing the treaty. However, they believe that this will not become a serious obstacle. Finnish President Paasikivi and Prime Minister Pekkala did not attend the negotiations due to poor health. It is expected that the negotiations on the 21st will not involve serious discussions. The Finnish representatives are expected to stay here for a week.</p>

<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 22nd] In light of recent developments in Czechoslovakia, the United States is currently reviewing the "implications and responsibilities" of Czechoslovakia's willingness to sign a tariff and trade agreement with the US government. The State Department announced earlier last week that Czechoslovakia had notified the United States that it was willing to sign the agreement negotiated by 23 countries in Geneva last October. The United States has already signed this agreement with several other countries. In another statement issued by the State Department yesterday, it was stated: "The Czech government has notified this government that it intends to sign the Protocol on Provisional Application of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on March 20, 1948, so that the agreement will provisionally come into effect on April 20, 1948." "The United States is currently reviewing the implications and responsibilities of this agreement in light of recent developments in Czechoslovakia."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 22nd] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic recently presented notes to the British, American, and French ambassadors in Belgrade, expressing the strongest protest against the manner in which the governments of Britain, the United States, and France proposed to amend the part of the Italian peace treaty concerning Trieste.</p>
<p>The notes stated: "The Yugoslav government solemnly protests the fact that the governments of Britain, the United States, and France deem it necessary to seek the consent of Italy, but do not deem it necessary to obtain the consent of Yugoslavia, the most concerned allied country. Due to this manner, it can be presumed that the purpose of the proposals put forward by Britain, the United States, and France is not to seek the best solution to the Trieste issue and to revive the people of Southern Europe, but to have a propaganda effect and does not contribute to the consolidation of peace. Under these circumstances, the Yugoslav government cannot accept the completeness of this proposal."</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 21st] People close to the Soviet and Yugoslav authorities here stated that if the Italian Communist Party can win in the upcoming elections, the Yugoslav government would be willing to return Trieste to Italy. The Communist Party has made similar statements in its election speeches, stating that if the Communist Party can occupy a dominant position in parliament, Marshal Tito would be willing to return Trieste.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Republicans in the US House of Representatives disregarded the protests of the Senate leaders on the 22nd and independently promoted their all-encompassing foreign aid bill of $6.25 billion. Congressman Vorys listened to opinions at the House Rules Committee. Several committee members opposed the bill, but there is no doubt that it will be submitted to the House for debate starting on the 23rd. Senior House Republicans are confident that the House will pass the bill in its original form and it will become law. However, Senate leaders stand firm and will oppose the military part of it. The Senate's plan is to handle the government's foreign aid requests one by one.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] House Republican leaders are confident that the House can pass the unified foreign aid bill of $6.25 billion without modification. However, Senate leaders continue to insist on opposing the combination of military aid to Greece, Turkey, and China with the European recovery plan. The foreign aid plan passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee includes: (1) $5.3 billion for European recovery; (2) $570 million for economic and military aid to China; (3) $275 million for military aid to Greece and Turkey; (4) $60 million for the International Children's Welfare Fund. This bill will be discussed in the House on the 22nd. House Republican leaders have allowed efforts to be made to pass the bill before April 1st, but because it is of a unified nature, it will still cause disputes with the Senate. Senate leaders hope that the two houses can reach an agreement before April 10th, eight days before the Italian election.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 21st] Official news, Turkey.

Sofia has officially announced that the Turkish military attaché stationed there is no longer welcome because his activities are detrimental to Bulgaria's security. The Turkish military attaché left the Bulgarian capital on the 18th, so Turkey has also requested that the Bulgarian military attaché immediately withdraw from the Turkish capital. The Bulgarian military attaché stationed in Turkey left Ankara last night.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Senior government officials here revealed on the 22nd that Czechoslovakia had attempted to order four-engine jumbo transport planes from the United States, presumably for flights across the Atlantic to Europe, both before and after the Communist coup, but was unsuccessful. American aircraft manufacturers have no indication of selling this type of aircraft, and the government opposes exporting aircraft or parts to countries within the Soviet bloc. Informed sources said: "For months, the United States has been constantly reviewing exports to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries to see if they contribute to their war potential. Transport planes can be included in the above item." There is also a strong indication here that the United States may refuse to implement the tariff and trade agreement signed by 23 countries in Geneva last October with Czechoslovakia. Since the Communist coup, the United States has abandoned plans to negotiate a friendly commercial navigation treaty with Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] US Senator Taylor on the night of the 21st requested that President Truman dismiss Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who opposed the partition of Palestine in order to protect American oil interests in Arab countries. At the same time, Senator Lodge accused third-party presidential candidate Wallace of advocating a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union, causing division across the United States. Taylor, formerly a Democrat and now the third-party vice-presidential candidate, stated in a letter to President Truman that Forrestal is now taking the offensive, attempting to tailor American diplomatic and military policies solely for the benefit of American oil imperialism. The Department of Defense stated that Forrestal would not express any opinion on this until President Truman received the letter.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] According to senior officials of the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the current lack of US dollars in the sterling area and the limited trading market have caused a large accumulation of Japanese cotton textiles after the war. Since August last year, the cloth stored by Japanese textile trading companies has reached 11 million yards. The government official expressed his fear that unless the Japanese government takes steps in the near future to distribute this inventory, this large amount of cotton textiles may rot and be unable to be sold. In view of the lack of US dollars in the sterling area, the official specifically suggested that the government use this batch of surplus cotton textiles as barter to exchange for raw materials from the sterling area, instead of insisting that they purchase goods with US dollars. At the same time, Vice Minister of Commerce and Industry Kiyota Fumin hinted that a portion of this accumulated cotton textile may be used as domestic consumer goods to alleviate Japan's severe shortage of clothing. He also pointed out that 70% of the cotton textiles produced in the country must be withdrawn abroad in order to earn US dollars to purchase the various raw materials needed.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Senior US economic experts held their first meeting with officials of the Allied occupation authorities on the 22nd. At this meeting, MacArthur's views on Japanese compensation were conveyed to the economic survey mission. Reliable sources told the Associated Press that Assistant Secretary of the Army Royall and his team held a meeting on the 22nd with representatives of the Allied Headquarters Compensation Department and officials of the Economic and Scientific Department who directly handle Japanese industry. The meeting began at 9:30 in the morning and was still in a closed-door session in the afternoon. It is recalled that MacArthur expressed his support for a more lenient transfer of compensation from Japan. This view has been specifically expressed in the recently published report of the Strack Committee on Japan, which is even more lenient than MacArthur's view. Reliable sources pointed out that, in view of the US Army Department's statement by Royall advocating "Japanese self-sufficiency," the US economic survey mission may stipulate that the 30% temporary compensation decided by the Far Eastern Commission is the final compensation. The source said that if Japan is to become a communist fortress in the Far East supported by gold, no one can better understand the danger of weakening Japanese industry and its economy than the US economic survey mission. It is noted that the Strack Committee came to Japan on the orders of the Army Department. The committee recommended that everything except major industries should not be moved from Japan as compensation. It is reported that the US economic survey mission came to Japan to collect more local data. The mission intends to conduct a "final review" before submitting a change in Japan's compensation policy to the Far Eastern Commission. It is certain that a formal change in the US's compensation policy towards Japan will encounter opposition in the Far Eastern Commission.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, New York, 21st] The US toy industry is booming. During the last few days of the annual New York Toy Fair, 800 exhibitors made huge profits. The only concern is that if war breaks out again and the United States begins to restrict the use of war materials, toy merchants will be hit. Fallon, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers Association, said that toy sales this year are better than last year, and the shipments of some factories this year have been fully ordered. Steel toys have the best sales. Lionel Corporation, which manufactures electric toy trains, said that its shipments for 1948 have been sold out, setting a record for sales.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Comparing the Strengths of the US and the Soviet Union <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Office</p>
<p>Currently, the Soviet Union is not industrially strong enough to support an offensive war. Even by 1960, the Soviet Union's industrial strength will likely not exceed two-fifths of that of the United States, although it will then be much greater than it is now and far surpass that of the British Empire.</p>
<p>According to materials collected by the British and American governments, the Soviet Union's current strength lies in its large population and its almost impenetrable geographical position. Its future hopes rest on this large population and the abundant resources that can be continuously developed in the coming years. As for the Soviet Union's weaknesses, in addition to the losses it suffered during the war, they are a poor transportation system, relatively low levels of public skills, and agriculture that has consistently failed to meet needs.</p>
<p>A comparison of the Soviet Union's level of development with that of the United States in the past and present provides the clearest understanding.</p>
<p>In overall capacity, the Soviet Union is approximately 45 years behind the United States. In 1940, before the start of the war against Germany, its economic strength was roughly equivalent to that of the United States in 1902. By 1950, at the end of the current Five-Year Plan, its strength is expected to be equivalent to that of the United States in 1904. By 1960, if current trends continue, its economic position will be roughly similar to that of the United States in 1915.</p>
<p>In terms of worker productivity, the Soviet Union will not be able to reach the level of the United States in 1915 by 1960. According to available data, in 1960, the Soviet Union's per capita productivity will be about half that of the United States in 1915.</p>
<p>In terms of railway length, the Soviet Union is far behind the United States. In 1940, its railway length was approximately equal to that of the United States in 1872, or 57,323 miles. Currently, the United States has more than 226,000 miles of railway.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's development from 1928, when it began to emphasize industrial construction, to 1940, is quite similar to the industrial growth that occurred in the United States after the Civil War. Before 1940, the speed of industrial progress in the Soviet Union was approximately one and a quarter times the speed of industrial progress in the United States before 1902. However, whether it can maintain the same rate of industrial growth as the United States in the future remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A major setback to the Soviet Union's industrial plan was caused by the war. During this war, it lost 58 percent of its vehicles, 45 percent of its steel production, 44 percent of its electricity, and 58 percent of its coal production. In addition, it lost a quarter of its livestock and millions of homes, farm buildings, churches, schools, bridges, and various commercial buildings. Its economic strength fell from 42 percent of that of the United States to only 25 percent. A major goal of the current Five-Year Plan is to make up for wartime losses and restore the stockpiles of materials and food. This explains why the Soviet Union is expected to reach only the level of the United States in 1904 by 1950. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Recommendation for UN Trusteeship of the Holy Land: Countries Await US Clarification of Measures; Security Council Scheduled to Hold Debate Tomorrow <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 21st] The United Nations Security Council will resume discussion of the Palestine issue on Wednesday, debating the United States' proposal for temporary UN trusteeship over Palestine.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 21st] Small countries in the United Nations may not immediately support the United States' new plan for trusteeship over Palestine, and will wait for the US authorities to clearly indicate that they have a plan to implement it. It is said that more than ten small countries want to obtain the approval of the major powers first. Last November, these countries voted in favor of the partition plan, because at that time the United States insisted that partition was the only way to resolve the Palestine dispute. According to informed sources in the United Nations, if the small countries are to support the United States' new plan, the State Department must first clearly explain how the trusteeship plan under construction can be implemented. The Jewish people have vowed to oppose the new plan with all their might. The Arab people have welcomed the United States' abandonment of the partition plan, but they are also skeptical of the trusteeship plan. Some in the United Nations believe that the implementation of the trusteeship plan is as difficult as implementing the partition plan, or even more so.</p>
<p>Currently, after the United States announced its new proposal in Austin, the Soviet Union is the only major power insisting that the partition plan should be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Approved by the Municipal Council Upon Proposal by the Public Works Bureau: Decision to Build a Tunnel for the Cross-River Project; Location Selected Along the Riverfront on Zhongzheng East Road; Land in Two Districts Reserved for Expropriation to Prevent Rapid Increase in Land Prices <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In order to promote the prosperity of Shanghai, the municipal government has designed a cross-river project, planning to develop Pudong in order to alleviate congestion in the city. A Cross-River Project Committee was established last spring to conduct in-depth research, which found that the main options for crossing the river were a viaduct, a low-level movable bridge, and a tunnel. However, a decision on the most rational method had not been made for a year. According to information obtained by this reporter yesterday from relevant sources, the Cross-River Project Committee recently decided that building a tunnel is the most appropriate method for the cross-river project, and the Public Works Bureau submitted it to the municipal government's municipal council last week, where it was approved in principle. The location of the cross-river tunnel has been decided to be on the Huangpu River bank on Zhongzheng East Road. To avoid congestion at the entrances and exits, the tunnel will have two entrances on the Puxi side: one on Zhongzheng East Road and one on Zhongshan East Road (the Bund).</p>
<h3 id="e84">Source of Project Funding <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>After detailed discussions by the relevant authorities, it is believed that it would be more reasonable to obtain the construction funds for this project from the increased land value tax revenue and the collection of tolls. If the tunnel location is decided immediately, the Pudong land will be reorganized and replanned at the same time, which can both achieve the effect of development and solve a portion of the funding source. In order to prevent rapid increases in land prices and hinder the progress of land reorganization, it is proposed to request, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law, that approximately 30 square kilometers of land in the Yangjing and Tangqiao districts of Pudong be first announced by the municipal government as reserved for expropriation, to prevent transfer.</p>
<p>It is also confirmed that when the former American public works experts Dr. Conway and Dr. Hall visited Shanghai to investigate, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang discussed the issue of borrowing funds for the cross-river project with them, and they indicated that it could be discussed. If the funding problem is resolved, this great project, unprecedented in Shanghai's history, can be expected to be built smoothly.</p>
<p>Reasons for Building a Tunnel</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from the Cross-River Project Committee's resolution on why building a tunnel is the most appropriate method for the cross-river project: A. Regarding national defense: (1) Avoid air raids and reduce threats. (2) Unrestricted navigation for warships. B. Regarding port development: (1) Bridges restrict port development. (2) Preserve the Shanghai-Zhapu-Hangzhou Bay port plan. C. Regarding water transportation: (1) Movable bridges narrow the waterway. (2) Bridge opening times must coincide with tides. (3) Bridge piers obstruct tides. D. Regarding land transportation: (1) Long approach bridges detract from the city's appearance. (2) Movable bridges have limited capacity. (3) Bridge opening times cause traffic congestion. E. Regarding engineering facilities: Bridge pier foundations are prone to subsidence. F. Regarding construction costs: In terms of construction costs, movable bridges are the cheapest, followed by tunnels, and then viaducts. In terms of capacity, viaducts have the highest capacity, followed by tunnels, and then movable bridges. Therefore, although movable bridges have the lowest construction costs, they have the smallest capacity, while viaducts have the highest capacity but the highest construction costs. Therefore, tunnels are more suitable.</p>

<p>The High Prosecutor's Office yesterday received a national government gazette reprinting a national government order stating that reports of traitor cases would be closed from January 1, 1947. It has been found that in recent years, there have been many cases of people filing lawsuits under false pretenses, causing many abuses. In the future, cases that have not been investigated by a prosecutor will not be accepted, unless they are filed by the victims themselves. Cases that are under investigation or on trial should also be handled expeditiously in accordance with various laws and regulations, based on definitive evidence, in order to bring them to a close. After receiving this gazette, the office has separately instructed all prosecutors to comply. It is reported that the investigation of traitor cases in this city can be completed in the short term.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Due to the recent increase in civil cases, the High Court has established a fourth civil division, as the original three civil divisions are insufficient to handle the caseload. Feng Zhidong, the chief clerk of the High Court, has been promoted to the position of division chief. Hu Zhichao and Zhang Hongfu have been appointed as judges in the division. Han Shuzhi, a judge, has been appointed to fill the vacancy of chief clerk.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Social Bureau to Shorten the Term of the Sugar Price Evaluation Council; Abuse Can Be Eliminated When the Ration Price Approaches the Market Price <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau and Chairman of the Municipal Price Evaluation Council, again gave a speech yesterday on the issue of external accusations of corruption in the distribution of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, explaining the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the sugar price review issue: In accordance with the provisions of the "Measures for Implementing Price Evaluation," the city has organized a Price Evaluation Committee, under which there is a Sugar Group. The Sugar Group consists of one representative each from the Social Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Sugar Business Association, and the South Goods Business Association, and the Civil Affairs Bureau is invited to send a representative to participate. The Sugar Group holds a review meeting every two weeks to specifically review the allocation prices and wholesale prices of Taiwan Sugar. All pricing standards take into account not only the cost of production and the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar, but also the local market price and other commodity prices. Recently, general commodity prices have fluctuated too drastically, and sugar prices are no exception. Therefore, it seems that holding the Sugar Group review meeting every two weeks is too infrequent, because there are many changes in two weeks. Merchants often take advantage of the opportunity of fixed sugar prices to compete to buy, resulting in a gap between the evaluated price and the market price that is too large. In the future, the Sugar Group review meeting will be shortened to once a week, depending on the development of the situation, to prevent the occurrence of the aforementioned situation.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the registration of sugar merchants: The Social Bureau, in view of the fact that allocated materials are often contested by general merchants and civilians, has drafted "Guidelines for Preventing Merchants and Civilians from Speculating and Profiteering," which has been submitted to the 99th Municipal Council meeting for approval and implementation. Only sugar merchants who have been in business for more than two years and have obtained proof from two fellow merchants and the association are allowed to register. After registration, they must apply to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for allocation, and only after investigation and review can they obtain the allocation. The aforementioned measures apply not only to sugar allocation, but also to the allocation of yarn, cloth, and coal. In order to prevent profiteers from infiltrating, the Social Bureau will not only make every effort to manage registration, but also cooperate with relevant agencies to strictly crack down on them.</p>
<p>Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Division of the Social Bureau, told reporters that regarding the accusation of falsely established firms, if citizens report them, the authorities are prepared to conduct spot checks. The authorities also believe that the reason why sugar merchants compete to set up commercial firms to obtain sugar allocation is because the allocation price is too far from the market price. Therefore, they are considering raising the allocation price so that it is not much different from the market price. If merchants see no profit to be made, the situation of abuse can be eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Witnesses Summoned Yesterday in the Tongji University Student Unrest Case <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In the case of the Tongji University student unrest, in which Mayor Wu was assaulted, 11 students, including Huang Kelu, have been prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. Judge Hu Zhichao of the District Court held the first public trial on the 15th of this month, but because important witnesses, such as Zhang Jugong, did not appear in court, the hearing was rescheduled. Yesterday, Mayor Wu's adjutant Zhang Jugong, Tongji University's Dean of Students Jiang Hong, Hu Liping, a female student from Xia Guang Middle School, Zhang Lianyun, a police officer from the security police team, and Song Shiyuan were summoned to testify. However, only Zhang appeared in court. According to Zhang's testimony, when the students were assaulting the mayor, he only saw the defendant Qu Yuping at the scene. He could not remember the other people because it had been too long. If he saw them, he might be able to identify them. He could not identify the person who threw stones at the cavalry because there were too many people at the time. As for someone saying that he saw Wang Gongwei assaulting the mayor, that was not true. However, there was a person with a surgical scar on his nose who did assault the mayor. The court ordered Zhang to appear in court again at the next hearing to identify the person. Judge Hu Zhichao, who was handling the case, has been transferred to the Civil Division of the High Court, and the District Court will appoint another judge to handle the case.</p>
<h3 id="e90">First Meeting of the Human Rights Protection Committee; Scope of Cases to be Handled Determined <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Human Rights Protection Committee, which was established by a resolution of the Fifth General Assembly of the Municipal Council, held its first meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Council's offices on Tanggu Road. Chairman Pan presided over the meeting. As a result of the discussions, the following decisions were made: (1) The committee will be named the "Shanghai Municipal Council Human Rights Protection Committee." (2) Senators Tao Baichuan, Li Wenjie, Jiang Pingfan, and Qu Cheng will be assigned to draft the committee's organization and the scope and procedures for handling human rights protection cases. The scope will be limited to the legal framework, with the principle of protecting cases involving personal freedom, because if all the human rights protection clauses stipulated in the Constitution are accepted, the scope will be too large and impossible to handle thoroughly. At the same time, it would not be appropriate for the committee to exceed its legal authority. (3) The case submitted by the families of the dancers, musicians, and other employees detained from the dance halls, and the families of the workers detained in the Shenxin Textile Factory strike case, who have been detained for many days for allegedly destroying the Social Bureau and Shenxin No. 9 Factory, requesting the committee to uphold justice and protect human rights, was proposed for discussion. Resolution: Regarding the long detention of the personnel involved in the two cases, the municipal government should be requested to transfer them to the court for investigation in accordance with the law as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Conscription Lottery to be Held Today; Propaganda Rally Held at the Queen's Theater Yesterday; Heads of Various Departments Gave Speeches Hoping for Enthusiastic Military Enlistment <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The city's first conscription lottery will be held at 2:00 PM today at the Municipal Council. The Conscription Association, because this is the first time that the city is implementing conscription by lottery and simultaneously implementing the voluntary military service system, and because the general public may not fully understand the significance of this and the methods involved, held a conscription propaganda rally at the Queen's Theater at 9:00 AM yesterday. More than 2,000 people attended, making it a very grand event.</p>
<p>"Troops Can Be Unused for a Hundred Days, But Must Be Prepared for Every Single Day."</p>
<p>Chairman Fang Zhi gave an opening speech, explaining the tyranny of the communists, who are attempting to control all of China and bring it under the control of the Communist International. Once the communists arrive, our lives and property will be destroyed. He called on all eligible young men in the city to rise up and join the military, defend their local areas, serve the national army, shoulder the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion, and complete the mission of national reconstruction. Fang ended his speech with the resounding call, "Troops can be unused for a hundred days, but must be prepared for every single day. This is true in peacetime, and even more so during the suppression of the rebellion."</p>
<p>"Will Certainly Enthusiastically Enlist, Maintain the Traditional Spirit"</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan followed with a speech, reporting on the Conscription Association's assistance to the government in carrying out the voluntary military recruitment last year, and gave a brief report on this year's conscription methods: (1) The city will conscript 6,000 people this year. Because the central government knows that the city is a commercial and industrial area, the proportion is smaller than that of other provinces and cities. (2) The previous conscription meeting decided, and the Municipal Council approved, that in addition to implementing regular conscription by lottery in accordance with the law, the voluntary military service method will also be implemented. (3) The 6,000 new recruits conscripted this year are planned to be assigned to the newly established garrison brigade in the city, to be trained locally, and to be used to strengthen the military force protecting Shanghai. This method has been recommended to the central government, but a reply has not yet been received. Shanghai is the largest city in China, paying half of the country's taxes to the national treasury. We have reason to ask the central government to assign these 6,000 new recruits to the garrison brigade to protect the local area. Pan also mentioned that the Shanghai merchant regiment organization at the end of the Qing Dynasty laid the foundation for the success of the Xinhai Revolution, and that the "August 13th" Shanghai War of Resistance made glorious contributions to the country. Now that conscription is for the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, the citizens of Shanghai will certainly enthusiastically enlist to maintain this glorious traditional spirit. Pan finally called on those who have the ability to contribute their efforts, and those who have money should also have a conscience and contribute more money for the special relief donation. The Chinese nation is facing a serious crisis, so this move is a good test for the future of the nation.</p>
<p>"World Crisis is Deepening, Closely Related to Our Own Interests"</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also elaborated on "those with money should contribute money" and "those with ability should contribute their efforts." He pointed out that the world crisis is deepening and the European situation is turbulent. Today's China is not just a struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but is closely related to the interests of the nation. He hopes that those who have the ability will enthusiastically serve in the military, and those who have money must be made to contribute money. The Shanghai Garrison District Commander Zheng Mo and the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau Zhang Song also gave speeches in succession. Finally, the meeting was adjourned with loud slogans. After the meeting, there were also wonderful entertainment performances, such as the "Sending My Husband to Join the Army" opera by singers Li Jingjie, Li Rong, Liu Ying, and Jing Jing, "Military Music" by Xiao Kuaile, magic by Mo Feixian, and the "Kill the Enemy and Join the Army" drama by the Anti-Rebellion Drama Troupe.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] After the conscription lottery is held in the city today, the conscription tickets will be unsealed and handed over to the district offices for separate processing. The Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday issued the following instructions to the district offices regarding the unsealing of conscription tickets: (1) After the district offices receive the notice from the Civil Affairs Bureau to collect the tickets, they will send the person in charge to collect them with the receipt. (2) After the conscription tickets are collected, the district offices will immediately convene the precinct chiefs and invite representatives from the Municipal Council, district residents, and district party headquarters to unseal them publicly in the district office, and then distribute them to the precinct chiefs on the spot for collection. (3) The precinct chiefs will immediately bring the collected conscription tickets back and quickly forward them to the selected eligible men or their families for inspection and acceptance, without delay. (4) When the precinct chiefs are forwarding the conscription tickets, if they find that the name on the conscription ticket does not match anyone in the precinct, or if the person had previously registered for removal from the household, had been selected for another service, or had returned to their original home to serve in the military, and the conscription ticket cannot be forwarded, they will report to the district office and forward it to the Civil Affairs Bureau for verification. After verification and confirmation, the original conscription ticket will be cancelled and invalidated, and a replacement will be issued in the order of succession.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Finance Bureau Decides to Collect Housing Tax Based on Actual Rent Starting This Summer <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The city's housing tax was originally collected based on the standard of 180 times the rental value in 1937, with a tax rate of 5% for residential households and 10% for commercial households. The Finance Bureau believed that the above standard was no longer in line with the actual situation and proposed it to the municipal council for discussion, and a discretionary adjustment was made. The last general meeting of the Municipal Council discussed and resolved that, starting from March of this year, the housing tax would be changed to be collected based on the actual rent, but the tax rate would remain the same. According to Finance Bureau Director Tian Yongqian, the total number of households in the city is 250,000, and the total amount of housing tax collected last year was 2.7 billion yuan. It is estimated that the amount can be increased by about ten times after collecting based on the actual rent. The new method will be implemented starting this summer. The bureau is currently conducting a survey of the actual rental amount. The survey form has been distributed together with the spring housing tax ticket, asking each household to fill it out truthfully and return it. In order to prevent false reports, a random inspection method will be adopted. If false reports are found, they will be punished. The spring housing tax for this year will still be collected according to the old standard.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The city's Silver Shop License Review Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday at the Social Bureau. After review, it was decided that Fa Qiangxiang and Lao Baotian Yuji would not be issued licenses because their capital did not meet the requirements, and they would have to be issued after corrections were made. Lao Wanhua's application procedures did not comply with the regulations, and a license will not be issued. Bao Kang had been penalized for a gold and currency case, and will be reviewed again after the penalty decision is made. Zhang Jingyun must renovate the storefront before a license can be issued. Lao Eryun, Lao Tianhexingji, Zhu Tianbao, Yongxing Faji, Lao Qingbaorenji, and Tianbao Xingongji will be reviewed again after the Social Bureau sends personnel to investigate. Lao Yonghe Ji, Baocheng Gongji, and Xiang Taihe Ji are approved for the issuance of licenses. In addition, Lao Yunxiang Gu is approved for a provisional license.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since Zhang Renyou took office as the chief of the Water Police Sub-bureau, he has ordered his subordinates to strictly investigate and crack down on waterway smuggling. The other day, Xu Pixian and Wang Ruren, inspectors of the sub-bureau's inspection team, led police officers along the river to the Dadawu Pier and the No. 1 Pier on the Huangpu River, where they saw three vessels arriving from Hankou: the Hongda Wheel, the Puan Wheel, and the Hongxiang Wheel, which were unloading cargo. The police officers stepped forward to inspect and seized two large boxes of smuggled Western medicine, penicillin, and forty-eight tins of White Pagoda Oil. The officers then took the shipping agent Zhang Yongliang back to the bureau for questioning. Zhang confessed that he had transported the goods from Hankou via Aohan Road, intending to sell them in Qingdao. He had done this several times before, and they were all profitable. Continuing on to the No. 1 Pier of Dadawu, they seized more than 200 catties of smuggled sea cucumbers transported on the Longan Wheel, and 480 injections of Western medicine transported on the Hongxiang Wheel.

<h3 id="e100">Representatives from Nine Regions Gathered: The Flour Industry Federation Opens its Second Congress; Amendments to the Constitution and Group Reviews of Proposals <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The second National Congress of the Flour Milling Industry Association opened yesterday morning in the grand auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. More than sixty representatives from 198 flour mills in nine regions across the country, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shaanxi, Pu (possibly referring to Yunnan), Yunnan, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Qingdao, Tianjin, Ba (likely Sichuan), and Lan (likely Gansu), attended, along with over a hundred guests. The congress presidium consisted of Du Yuesheng, Yang Guanbei, Li Jishan, Xi Debing, Yuan Guoliang, Hu Mingxin, Fang Gang, Li Wenshan, Han Juchuan, Tian Juyi, Hua Erying, and ten other individuals. Special envoys from the Central Government were present to provide guidance, and Mayor Wu was also invited to attend. The congress chairman, Du Yuesheng, delivered an opening speech, stating that "With the implementation of the Constitution approaching, it is imperative for our industry to strive for its position and resolve difficulties externally, and safeguard our rights and interests. This cannot be achieved by any single factory alone. It requires the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. Therefore, we have convened this congress, hoping that representatives from various regions will provide as much information as possible about the difficulties and improvement methods of the industry for discussion. We must ensure that the association not only presents a united front in form, but also makes significant contributions in practice, in line with national policies, to fulfill our mission."</p>
<p>Unblocking Sources and Promoting Sales</p>
<p>Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, expressing three hopes: (1) That difficulties in flour sources be addressed by finding new supplies. (2) That prices should avoid a straight upward trend, to avoid stimulating other prices. (3) That those who consume flour are healthier than those who eat rice, and therefore, the sale of flour should be promoted to both increase people's health and expand business. Subsequently, Liu Siying, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, addressed the assembly, stating that there is currently a shortage of flour in the north, and the government is working to resolve it. He hoped that all members of the flour industry would cooperate fully and that the Ministry of Economic Affairs would consider helping if needed.</p>
<p>Continuing the Meeting Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Next, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, represented by Lu Jingshi, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food, represented by Liu Xingji, and guest Wu Yuncho, successively delivered speeches. Then, a temporary motion was passed to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang. The first congress was convened at 11:00 AM to revise the constitution and conduct group reviews of proposals. In the afternoon, a reception was hosted by the municipal Party and government organs. At 2:30 PM, the Gu group separately reviewed the proposals. The second congress will be convened tomorrow morning, with a session of three days, ending on the 24th.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Warehouses Store American Supplies: Covering All Needs from Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation; The Materials Supply Bureau Invited Senators and Others for a Tour Yesterday <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to clarify the bureau's business and storage and transportation conditions to all sectors, the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau specially invited city councilors and journalists to visit five units of the bureau's warehouses and storage yards yesterday. Those attending the tour included City Council Speaker Pan, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, Councilors Tao Baichuan, Chen Baotai, and more than 20 journalists, personally guided by Director Jiang Biao of the bureau. They departed from the bureau at 9:45 AM and concluded the tour at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The types of materials received by the bureau have now increased to as many as nine, among which the post-war surplus materials of the U.S. military in the Pacific Islands and within China transferred by the U.S. government's Foreign Liquidation Commission are the largest, totaling two million tons. Of these, 33% are vehicles, 17% are building materials, 13.5% are aviation equipment, 5% each are communications equipment and industrial equipment, 4% are machinery, 3% are electrical equipment, 5.6% are medical equipment, and other building materials, various tools, transport equipment, and related supplies each account for 1%. Textiles and photographic materials together account for 0.8%, stationery accounts for 0.2%, and other miscellaneous items account for approximately 10%.</p>
<p>Over One Million Tons Arrived in Seventeen Months</p>
<p>The bureau began processing this batch of materials in the autumn of 1946. In the 17 months since then, an estimated 1.3 million tons have been shipped into the country, stored in Shanghai and Qingdao, with Shanghai accounting for 99.5% and Qingdao accounting for 0.5%. In the Mariana Islands, 350,000 tons were received and resold to the Central Bank in November of last year in exchange for foreign currency. It is expected that approximately 300,000 tons can be received from Okinawa soon. Regarding the supply and sale of materials, the bureau follows government regulations and reserves most military, transportation, communications, industrial, mining, vehicle, and health materials and equipment for national defense, transportation, health, and other departments for transfer and use, totaling more than 80% of all shipped materials. The remaining amount is submitted by the bureau for approval for sale.</p>
<p>Materials Piled High, Storage Relatively Complete</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Mitsubishi and Lihe warehouses and the second storage yard on Fuxing Island and the first on Qimei Road were visited. All kinds of materials were seen piled up like mountains. The types of materials almost include the necessities for food, clothing, housing, and transportation, from a small nail or rope to a large car or boat. Most materials are stored relatively completely. Some outer packaging was damaged because it had been stored for many years before being received. Cars, boats and heavy equipment are mostly stored outdoors, inevitably exposed to wind and rain. It is reported that 90% of these materials have been priced and allocated to government agencies. Although withdrawals occur daily, the amount withdrawn is still small due to budget, settlement, urgent needs, customs clearance, transportation, and technical issues, so the amount occupying warehouses is still large.</p>
<p>First Half Budget Revenue of Eleven Trillion</p>
<p>The bureau has mostly adopted methods such as bidding, negotiation, and consignment sales for each sale of materials. The reserve price is determined by the evaluation committee set up by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the bureau. In 1947, the Ministry of Finance listed the bureau's revenue budget as 1.1 trillion national currency units. However, the total value of various materials sold by the bureau reached 1.5 trillion national currency units, plus more than 4 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange, exceeding the original budget by 60%. For the first half of this year, the bureau's revenue budget is listed as a total of 11 trillion units. As of March 14 of this year, the value of various materials sold has reached 5.2 trillion national currency units, plus approximately 1.15 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. It is expected that it will not be difficult to reach the budget amount.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Bank of China employees Liu Shanchang, Zhou Yaojin, Zhang Song, and others were arrested and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office because of a labor strike at four banks and two bureaus. Prosecutor Hu Jie interrogated them and released them on written bail of 500 million yuan each. The District Prosecutor's Office recently sent a letter to the Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance asking whether there are any disciplinary measures for bank employees who go on strike or are negligent in their duties. If so, the District Prosecutor's Office will handle the matter according to those measures. If not, it will be handled according to ordinary criminal law. Liu and others argued at the District Prosecutor's Office that they were holding a meeting within the Bank of China to discuss cooperative affairs and that it was unrelated to the strike on that day.

<h3 id="e107">Lawsuit Against Elected Legislator: Yan Huiqing Presents a Defense <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Issues with Vote Count Should Be a Lawsuit Against Invalidation of the Election; Defendant's Qualifications Meet Requirements and Were Nominated by the Central Government</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Veteran diplomat Yan Huiqing was nominated by the Central Government as a candidate for legislator in this city. Although Yan did not actively campaign, he was elected due to popular support. Subsequently, two people, Hao and Hu Jiafeng, raised objections and filed a lawsuit in the High Court, requesting confirmation that Yan's election was invalid. The case was heard yesterday morning by Gao Qimai, Chief Judge of the Civil Division of the High Court, in the Second Civil Court. The defendant, Yan Huiqing, hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to represent him in court and presented a defense, requesting the court to dismiss the plaintiffs' lawsuit. After the hearing, the court adjourned the case for a later hearing. The defendant's defense yesterday consisted mainly of two points: (1) Regarding the part of the plaintiffs' claim that the vote count was false, regardless of whether it is factual or not, the plaintiffs have not been able to provide any concrete evidence, which makes it difficult to believe. Even if each point is considered, it is purely an accusation of fraud by the election officials. It should fall under the first half of Article 37 of the Legislative Election and Recall Law, which concerns lawsuits for invalidation of the "election," not Article 38 of the same law, which concerns lawsuits for invalidation of "election." According to Interpretation No. 3714 of the Judicial Yuan, lawsuits for invalidation of the election should be filed against the committee members who also serve as chairmen as stipulated in Article 19 of the law. Since the plaintiffs did not file a lawsuit for invalidation of the election against the election officials in accordance with the first half of Article 37 of the law to confirm the existence of fraudulent circumstances, it is impossible to determine that the votes obtained by the defendant are untrue. They directly relied on Article 38 of the law and filed a lawsuit solely against the defendant to confirm that the votes obtained are untrue, which clearly does not distinguish between the types of election lawsuits and is not appropriate. (2) The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, as a member of the Kuomintang, was not nominated to the Central Government through the City Election Guidance Committee and did not comply with the election guidance regulations. He also failed to register as a candidate according to law, which means that he did not meet the qualifications. The investigation found that the defendant is not a member of the Kuomintang. He was directly nominated by the Central Government and handed over to the election headquarters, which then forwarded it to the Shanghai Election Office for registration as a candidate. This is different from the situation where the City Election Committee nominated to the Central Government, and it does not violate the law. The plaintiffs are attacking this fact, which is purely a matter of the procedures for registering a legislative candidate, not a matter of qualification. The so-called qualification of a legislative candidate refers to Article 6 of the Legislative Election and Recall Law, which stipulates that any citizen of the Republic of China who is over the age of twenty-three and does not have any of the following circumstances has the right to be elected. Since the defendant has the qualifications of a person with the right to be elected and has been nominated by the Central Government for registration as a legislative candidate, he is legally entitled to be elected. The plaintiffs are confusing the procedural issues of candidate registration with the issues of qualification, which is clearly wrong.</p>

Detailed measures will be discussed at the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee meeting. The text of Article 12 is "For the rice needed for collective living in factories, schools, etc., the factories, schools, etc. may collect the household rice purchase certificates of the workers and staff and apply to the People's Food Allocation Committee for payment and directly extract the rice from the warehouse."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Labor-Management Adjudication Committee convened a subcommittee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to study two points in the document submitted by the Industrial Association: (1) To increase the original rations of rice, sugar, oil, and coal for workers and add rations of clothing and fabrics to reduce the cost of living index; (2) To request the government to uniformly stipulate that wages be calculated according to the cost of living index of the previous month to facilitate cost calculation. After exchanging views with representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Labor Association, and the Industrial Association, the Adjudication Committee concluded that the municipal authorities have no right to decide on the first request and will suggest that the Central Government adopt it. The second request, because the prosperity of various industries and factories in this city varies, and the industrial downturn is not only a matter of indexes, the uniform rigid regulations cannot be applied and can be resolved through individual agreements in various industries. Therefore, it was decided to follow the provisions of Article 5 of the Shanghai Wage Adjustment Measures: "If the employer's operating conditions are poor after production and it is truly difficult to bear, the wages may be reduced through agreement between the labor and management awards without following Articles 3 to 5 of these measures. If the agreement cannot be reached, it shall be adjudicated by the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee." The above-mentioned research opinions of the subcommittee still need to be discussed at the current General Assembly of the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee for a final decision.</p>

<p>Five Points Expressed</p>
<p>The Association specifically expressed five points yesterday: (1) The residents do not oppose the bidding method, but the current residents should still have the right to continue residing. (2) The Central Trust Bureau's so-called management and usage fees are not legally based and should be regarded as rent. (3) The property is enemy and puppet, but the residents are not enemy and puppet. The authorities should not value wealth over the people. (4) There are still many enemy properties that have not been bid on. It should not repeatedly bid on the lane houses where poor people live. (5) Bidding will only increase the housing shortage and create refugees. The Association stated that most of the current residents are civil servants who worked diligently for the country during the War of Resistance. After the restoration, they were fortunate to have a place to live. If they are forcibly evicted, they will be homeless. Therefore, they appealed to the government to reconsider and formulate appropriate handling methods to solve the housing problems of tens of thousands of residents.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Night Visit to Dr. Maurer: Observing the Water Intake Experiment in Lanzhou <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Lanzhou by Our Newspaper, 18th] On the night of the 14th, the sky over Lanzhou was shrouded in dark clouds, and the first spring rain began to fall. The drizzling rain, to the farmers of Lanzhou who had long suffered from drought, was no longer seen as something "lubricating," but as if "gold" were falling from the sky. Bare-bottomed children couldn't help but clap their hands and sing: "Old sky, big earth, yellow millet, fifty big..." nursery rhymes.</p>
<p>On this dark night, five kilometers northwest of the city, on the banks of the Yellow River in Xujia, the light of electric lamps pierced through the chilling wind and bitter rain, illuminating a group of people doing</p>
<p>water intake experiments. In the swaying shadows, a foreigner in his fifties, with a kind face and healthy complexion, coupled with his snow-white hair, was deep in thought, writing something on paper, directing workers to do what he wanted them to do, and whispering to two or three people nearby, forgetting that his raincoat was already soaked by the rain—that foreign old man was Dr. Maurer, a sanitary engineering consultant of the Central Ministry of Health. The young people were Sun Runan, the mayor of Lanzhou, and engineers Zhou Zhichang, Xie Bingnan, and Wang Chongyi, the construction section chief. They started working at eight o'clock in the evening and didn't return to the city until twelve o'clock in the dead of night, dragging their weary figures.</p>
<p>The 14th was a Sunday. At nine o'clock in the morning, when everyone was planning how to spend this dreary rainy holiday, Dr. Maurer and Mayor Sun, and others, went to that place again to continue the unfinished experiment from last night and to inspect the progress of other related projects, until five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dr. Maurer was quite satisfied with this water intake experiment. The water intake well was made of reinforced concrete and used the "caisson method" from engineering, using water and the weight of each part to bury it in the soil, so that it was four meters lower than the lowest water level and one meter higher than the highest water level, so that it would be easier to draw water. The reason they worked late into the night was to use the relatively abundant electricity at night to conduct</p>
<p>water level rise and fall tests to calculate the amount of water supplied by the pumped water sample.</p>
<p>The general population of Lanzhou has a vague impression of tap water, and they are indifferent to Maurer's experimental work. It is difficult for them to believe what Dr. Maurer said, "After the completion of the tap water project, it will greatly benefit the health of citizens, and at least the mortality rate can be reduced by more than 10%." But Maurer did not regard this scientific ignorance as an obstacle. He considered it a supreme comfort to be able to serve these ignorant and simple Chinese folks.</p>
<p>Let us look back at Dr. Maurer and</p>
<p>the relationship with the Chinese people as proof. He was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA. After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he came to China to teach at the Beiyang Institute of Technology in Tianjin. At that time, it was the third year of Xuantong before the Republic of China. He witnessed the昏瞆 of the Manchu Qing imperial family and also welcomed the birth of the Republic of China. Three years later, he returned to the New World and worked in cities such as Chicago and Baltimore. From then on, he had a clear and deep love for China. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, he came to China again to serve on the Yunnan-Burma Railway. In the 34th year, he was again appointed by the Cultural Cooperation 事業 Committee of the US State Department, in the name of the World Health Organization, to serve as a sanitary engineering consultant to our Ministry of Health. The period he stayed in our country, in total, was no more than six or seven years, but he happened to have experienced three new eras in our country, from the overthrow of the Manchu Qing to the War of Resistance, from the 重光 of the homeland to the active quelling of unrest. In these many years of turmoil, he had his own views. He once said to people: "The years of turmoil have not destroyed any of China's construction. On the contrary, China is transforming in the turmoil, and there has been significant progress and development, especially in education. The spirit of service and patriotic enthusiasm of Chinese intellectual youths are admirable. In addition, the women's liberation movement has also made good achievements. I remember when I first came to China, most women were illiterate and dared not go out all day. Even Huang, the president of Beiyang Institute of Technology, with whom I had a very close personal relationship, his wife never met me. And in the process of more than 30 years, China already has female university presidents, female senators, and female reporters..."</p>
<p>Not only does he know one or two thousand Chinese characters, but he can also speak some Chinese with a heavy tone, with a slight Beijing accent. In the past three years, he has contributed to solving the problems of water supply and sewage in various cities in our country, although these contributions have not yet yielded great results. He has been</p>
<p>Nanjing, Chongqing, and Changsha designed a set of sewer and tap water projects. In terms of tap water projects, he has improved the water supply facilities in Nanjing's tap water project, prepared a preliminary plan for Sining, and completed the entire design for Lanzhou and solved various difficult problems after construction started. He is scheduled to go to Xi'an on March 19 to design the tap water project there, and then go to Tianjin to expand the tap water project there. If the World Health Organization ends recently, he will have to say goodbye to China temporarily.</p>
<p>His view on our country's health construction is: "Health construction is difficult to achieve an ideal state because it lacks a sufficient economic foundation. But what is gratifying is that the current Chinese people have begun to understand the importance of health to life. They are not only paying attention to personal hygiene, but also beginning to urge the government to build public health facilities. This is a good sign that a country is moving towards a more ideal step."</p>
<p>According to his plan, the Lanzhou tap water project he designed uses the population of 125,000 in the city center as the standard. If the total cost is 600,000 yuan in silver coins, then the average cost per person is less than five yuan, which is ten times lower than the tap water project in the United States. He said, a</p>
<p>good engineer should not only design an ideal plan, but also base the design on the local economic strength. This is why he tried to keep the design of the Lanzhou tap water project simple.</p>
<p>The fund for Lanzhou tap water is more than 4 billion yuan, which officially started construction on September 1 last year. The purchase of land to build factories, build water, add water meters, hardware rubber, motor pumps and other accessories, has almost been used up (currently there is a balance of more than 574 million yuan). The Gansu Provincial Government approved a loan of 10 billion yuan from the Agricultural Bank, and it is still uncertain whether it can be successful. However, pipe installation and other projects must be completed before the flood season. At present, the most urgent problem to be solved is the water pipes. The 127 tons allocated by the 总行 are still stranded in Shanghai and cannot be shipped. If 63 tons of water pipes are cast by the local machine factory, it will cost at least 2.2 billion yuan, and the tap water project office is unable to bear this cost. Now, according to Dr. Maurer's suggestion, it has been decided to use cement pipes and wooden pipes to replace some of the steel pipes. At the earliest, the entire project can be completed in November this year. At that time, Dr. Maurer will come to Lanzhou again to witness the birth of the baby he has painstakingly nurtured.

<h3 id="e118">Six Years Ago, the Case of Killing One's Own Child: The Former Teacher Files a Lawsuit: The Jiading District Prosecutor's Office Has Started Investigation <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiading by Our Newspaper, 20th] The case of Qin Jiefang from Qianmentang killing his younger brother Qin Yishu has been brought to light by Xu Diansheng, the victim's former teacher, who filed a secret report to the district prosecutor's office, causing a sensation in the city. To understand the details of the case, this reporter visited all relevant parties and learned the contents of the secret report. A summary is published as follows:</p>
<p>Qin Zanwen is a prominent family in Qianmentang. He had eight sons. The eldest is Jiefang, and Yishu (milk name Xiaoxing) is the youngest. He studied in the local primary school and then worked in business. Because he was not enterprising, he often stole items from home and sold them for money. He was repeatedly unrepentant, and his parents hated him deeply, and had the idea of killing him. In mid-September of the 31st year of the Republic of China (lunar calendar), Zanwen took advantage of Xiaoxing being at home and tied him up with ropes. Then, he struck him hard on the head with an iron bar, and then killed him with a 山笆. After death, he wrapped him in a quilt and buried him next to the ancestral tomb of the sixth 保 in Zhiting River in the village. For six years, all was peaceful. Xu Diansheng, who is over sixty years old, used to be the head of Qianmen Township and the principal of the township central school. He was dismissed from his post for some reason, and he resented Qin Jiefang, which is why he secretly reported Jiefang for killing his younger brother. Another saying is that the Xiaoxing brothers went out during the occupation and have not returned home since.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, after receiving the secret report, the District Prosecutor's Office ordered the police to arrest Jiefang on the 7th, held a court hearing, and released him on bail pending further investigation. On the 9th, the police were ordered to station at the place where Xiaoxing's body was buried in Zhiting River in Qianmentang. On the 13th, Prosecutor Li Yechu personally went to inspect the scene. There were many people present, including the defendant, the informer, the head of the township 保, the patrol officer from the Waigang Police Station, the local self-defense team, and the public. After questioning by Prosecutor Li, excavation began. At that time, only two small bones were found. Whether they are human bones or other animal bones is still under examination. The entire case is awaiting further investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi by Our Newspaper, 20th] Grain merchants in various counties of Jiangsu Province went to the province again on the 16th to petition for exemption from the grain business tax. Zhao Zhangji and Zhang Jingwei, representatives of the grain merchants in this county, returned to Wuxi. According to reports, Director Dong of the Finance Office still believes that it is difficult to accept the exemption issue, but he said that the reduction of the tax amount and the method of collection can be discussed in the long term. Zhang, a section chief of the Finance Office, made an informal estimate of the tax amount, estimating that the annual grain business tax for the entire province can be collected more than 300 billion, calculated based on a population of 5 million in the province, with an average daily consumption of two 合 of rice per person, calculated at a tax rate of 1.2%. At that time, Leng, the speaker of the Provincial Temporary Senate, believed that the government should not equate the grain industry with other goods, because the consumption of grain is very small for the rich, and all of it is on the poor, so he also expressed his opposition to this issue. Representatives from various counties will insist on fighting for it.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Overseas Chinese Leader He Baoren Talks About the Future of the Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company: Melting Overseas Chinese Capital from All Regions into One Furnace <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou by Our Newspaper, 18th] On July 12th last year, there was a very grand ceremony held in Xiamen, the city of overseas Chinese. Chairman Liu of Fujian Province, business giants from various parts of South China, and overseas Chinese leaders from various parts of Southeast Asia rushed to participate. That was the founding ceremony of the Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company hosted by Hu Wenhu. The establishment of the company was hailed as "the first initiative that can accommodate the investment of overseas Chinese capital from all regions and all levels, and can be used to develop construction projects on a large scale" (Chairman Liu's words). Now, the company has been established for almost ten months. The domestic industrial and economic people are happy to know about the investment situation of overseas Chinese businessmen from various regions during this period, and the past and future business of the company.</p>
<p>"This month is the season of spring warmth and flowers in the South, and it is also the season when people who have been steady and steady in industry and commerce are now beginning to gallop across the board. South China, in all aspects of domestic economic construction investment, is still an attractive and fertile place. The situation where various places are planning to develop and concentrate in the north, and large amounts of</p>
<p>capital is starting to move south, as an important part of South China, Fujian will certainly not be ignored. The establishment of the Rong office of China Textile Company, the start of the Fujian exploration team of the 資委會, the planning of a pulp mill by the US businessman Jiangnan Construction Company, the frequent trips of the commissioner of the Central Bank to Rong and Xiamen, and the visits of Luo Yuming, manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Sheng Mujie, commissioner, to Fujian to set up branches... all arouse a lot of interest in the problem of resource development in Fujian Province. Among them, the actions of the Economic Construction Company are the most eye-catching, because after all, the extensibility of the company's capital is too large, and the relationship with the planned and large-scale development undertakings of Fujian Province is too large. He Baoren, the deputy manager of the company, happened to come to Rong from Xiamen during this period to inspect the business. Therefore, the reporter also had an opportunity to get more news about the company's development.</p>
<p>The motivation for the establishment of the Economic Construction Company was originally to melt overseas Chinese capital from all regions into one furnace, with the main purpose of developing the resources of the hometown. Therefore, the shareholders of the company are widely distributed. Hu Wenhu and his son Hu Haoyi are one of the important shareholders. Others include Huang Chaolong, Huang Chaoqun, Chen Bingding, etc. in the Dutch Indies, Chen Zhaoji, Yan Zijun, etc. in Vietnam, Huang Qihua in the Philippines, Li Junxia in Malaya, and Zhong Wenxian, Bai Chenggen, Chen Liushi, Huang Chongji, Lin Shuyan, Wang Zhenxiang, Huang Rushui, Lin Yashuo, Huang Yuyi, He Baoren, etc. in Singapore, Penang, Perak, Bangun, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shanghai... The reason why they want to adopt this method is nothing more than to grasp and absorb the overseas Chinese capital of each part through their social and economic status in each region, and to engage in more expanded investment plans. However, this plan was affected by the tension in the Dutch Indies and the huge losses of overseas remittances in the Philippines and Borneo. Therefore, the originally planned capital of 20 billion yuan only received 10 billion yuan at the time of establishment.</p>
<p>Handling Three Major Departments: (1) Factory Department, equipped with an iron factory, handling sand casting, nail making, and repairing machinery. The factory is located in Xiamen. (2) Trade Department, equipped with Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Trading Company, handling trade in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wuxi, and other places. (3) Investment Department, the investors who have invested successively include Fuzhou Economic Construction Public Military Vehicle Company, Xiamen Ferry Company, Gutian Hanshui Hydroelectric Power Company, and at one time, they also invested in Dehua Porcelain Factory and planned to invest in Minbei Native Products Sales Company. Although the business situation during the period was not ideal due to objective circumstances, the profits were still considerable due to the vision of the people involved.</p>
<p>Of course, what is mentioned above is only some of the exploratory activities carried out by the company so far. There is still a lot of room left for its future plans. According to Deputy General Manager He, the current</p>
<p>major undertakings in Fujian Province are transportation, hydropower, and forests. The company is determined to cooperate fully with the provincial authorities to develop them. During the talks with Chairman Liu in Xiamen, he, standing from the government's position, only allowed the company to succeed and not to fail. The company's colleagues expressed great excitement, and therefore, there is also a plan to increase capital by 50 billion yuan. Regarding this, He talked about the preliminary plan for the future as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establish an Economic Construction Bank: This move failed to be established in the past due to government regulations. However, for the purpose of regulating finance, absorbing overseas remittances, and supporting industrial and mining enterprises, the establishment of the bank seems to be imminent. Therefore, once permission is obtained, it will still be established.</p>
<p>(2) Establish factories: In order to cooperate with the processing of important agricultural products in Fujian Province, the company has decided to build several factories in the near future to strengthen exports and recover profit rights.</p>
<p>(3) Mining coal mines: The company plans to mine coal mines in a certain place in western Fujian, with the time being in the near future. The exact location will not be announced for the time being.</p>
<p>(4) Develop transportation: It will be carried out in coordination with the coal mine mining plan and the route for the sales of local products.</p>
<p>(5) Increase branch organizations: According to the current two companies in Xiamen and Fuzhou and the offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, it has been decided to increase them in the future, especially since a branch company will be set up in Taiwan recently, and then extended to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The reporter asked about the recent</p>
<p>factories in the Beijing-Shanghai area generally have plans to move south. Is it possible for the Economic Construction Company to invest and cooperate with them to operate together? He said: This move in Fujian is probably difficult to achieve at present. The main reasons are the power supply and the transportation of raw materials. The former must wait until the successful installation of the Gu Hanshui power plant before it can be solved. The latter must wait until several major trunk lines in the province are completed before it can be considered. In short, He said: "The Economic Construction Company has abundant overseas Chinese capital, but its growth and prosperity depend on the government's effective guarantee. Especially in terms of import and export settlement, raw material procurement, and factory establishment, there are the most places where the government needs to assist. Otherwise, with capital, it is useless in today's era of drastic financial fluctuations. He believes that the shareholders of the Economic Construction Company are all wealthy overseas Chinese leaders in various parts of Southeast Asia. The purpose of running the company is to serve with a higher nature than to make profits, and it is very possible to increase capital.</p>
<p>Deputy Manager He is from Xiamen and is 53 years old this year. He is an old colleague of Hu Wenhu and has been running social relief undertakings in various parts of Malaya, Southeast Asia for 30 years. He stayed in Rong for ten days to inspect the business of the automobile company, etc., and then he had to go to the bay area. (Our reporter Huang Yi Qing)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou by Our Newspaper, 17th] A robbery and kidnapping case occurred at No. 18 Hutung Daishu inside Zhengzhou City on the night of the fifteenth. The victim was Zhang Liusuo, deputy manager of Yihe Grocery Store at No. 55 Xidajie, from Mixian, 32 years old. Zhang returned home after guarding the store that night, and a plainclothes bandit holding a box cannon broke in. There were four other accomplices, two on the lookout and two guarding the gate. One of the bandits, wearing a military coat inside and a black overcoat outside, held a lantern and first grabbed Zhang and said: "Someone reported that you are taking drugs, you have committed a crime." Zhang asked him: "Which part?" The bandit pointed the gun at Zhang's chest, and the remaining bandits then overturned cabinets, robbing about 30 million in cash and two gold rings weighing six coins. Before leaving, they also took Zhang away. Zhang's wife reported the situation to Zhang Guodong, a shareholder of the store, at his home at 12 o'clock that night. When the shareholder went to Daishu Hutong, the bandits had already gone far away, so he turned to the store, and learned that several bandits had taken Zhang to the counter and wrote an IOU for 50 million yuan, and said that they would come to collect the money the next afternoon. No one went to collect the money the next day, and Zhang's whereabouts were unknown. This bizarre robbery and kidnapping case urgently needs to be solved to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>[Reported by our Wuxi correspondent on the 21st] Gu Ruizhong, a Xinghua native, unable to bear the Communist bandits' depredations, led his wife, Ms. Qian, and their four-year-old daughter on a dilapidated boat to Wuxi around November last year. They moored near his elder brother Rui Ren's residence by the Tongde Bridge in Ximen, downstream from the Geng Yu Cloth Factory, eking out a living by scavenging. However, the embankment there was of simple construction. Furthermore, due to continuous rain, the stone foundations loosened. This morning at 2:00 AM, the bank suddenly collapsed, and the falling stones mostly landed on Gu's boat, instantly sinking it. The family of three was unable to escape and were crushed to death. At daybreak, his elder brother heard the news and rushed to help, but it was too late. He then met with the chief of the neighborhood, Si Gangzheng, reported the incident to the local court, and requested compensation for funeral expenses. Prosecutor Zhu led officials to examine the bodies. Gu and his wife were still in the same quilt, completely naked, a truly tragic sight. It was confirmed that they had been suffocated to death. Because the corpses' relatives were unwilling to claim them, the chief was instructed to temporarily guard them. The aftermath of the deaths has not yet been resolved. The former vice-president of the puppet Legislative Yuan, 穋逆斌, has a Western-style house in the Xidaoyuan Alley in the southern part of the city, which was previously sealed and confiscated. Now, the county court's prosecutor's office, together with the Central Trust Bureau, have commissioned the Construction Industry Association to verify the valuation. After submitting it to the Jiangsu Higher Court for reassessment, it will be put up for auction. However, if prices rise again during the auction, they will be calculated according to the increased price. Furthermore, the traitor Xu Zifan has a house in the Houxixi area of the city, which is also currently being auctioned by the court. The houses of other traitors such as Zhou Afu will also be scheduled for auction.</p>

<h3 id="e129">General Liu Kan's Martyrdom: Before and After <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Aviation dispatch from our correspondent in Xi'an on the 18th] Starting from February 22nd, a great battle broke out again in the previously peaceful northwest. The scale of this war and the intensity of the artillery fire were truly unprecedented. General Liu Kan of the National Army used his life and hot blood to write the most heroic page in the history of bandit suppression. Aozijie, with its crisscrossing earthen hills between Yi (chuan) and Luo (chuan), became the "Menglianggu" of the Northwest.</p>
<p>Last month, the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi held a high-level military conference. According to subsequent rumors, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Zhao Shoushan all personally participated. They decided that starting this spring, they would begin with Yichuan, take the city, then flee westward, cut off the transportation between Yan'an and Xi'an, and communize northern Wei. Then, they would surround the National Army strongholds along the Xianyu line and defeat them one by one. Their ambition was to use the old pocket-shaped areas of the Huanglong Mountains and Malan as bases, making the area north of the Wei River like southern Jin and the area south of the Wei River like western Henan. On February 22nd, the Communist bandits' First, Third, and Second columns sneaked to the outskirts of Yichuan, and fierce fighting broke out. The bandit army launched several fierce attacks, but all were repelled by the National Army within the city. On the 27th, General Liu Kan implemented an encirclement and suppression campaign in Luochuan.</p>
<p>Leading his troops in a pledge, General Liu Kan said to the officers and soldiers under his command: "The bandit army has mobilized 70,000 to 80,000 men this time, intending to cause trouble in northern Shaanxi. As revolutionary soldiers, we must give them a severe blow. For the past ten months or so, we have been very envious of the National Army in central and northeastern China for being able to have a great fight with the bandit army, but we in northern Shaanxi have not been able to find any bandits to fight. This opportunity has come. We must capture Zhu and Mao alive to eliminate future troubles. Whether we succeed or die, this is the battle!" His tone was impassioned and full of righteousness, and the morale was greatly boosted. General Liu also ordered senior cadres to write their wills to show their determination.</p>
<p>After the troops took their oath, they advanced eastward from Luochuan. The mountainous area between Yi and Luo is crisscrossed with mountains and the terrain is very complex. The mountains extend from the northwest to the southeast, and the soil is barren, like other places in northern Shaanxi. Aozijie (thirty li from Yi (chuan)), lies in a ravine between the mountains, hence the name Aozijie. It is a desolate and cold place with only twenty-odd households. The vanguard of the National Army, the Zhou Youzhi and Li Da brigades, encountered the bandit army in that area. At that time, the bandit leader Wang Zhen had just led the Second and Eighth columns, with six brigades numbering about 20,000 men, from the south. After a desperate battle with the bandit army, our army gloriously sacrificed themselves. Most of the bandit army retreated in defeat to the north and south, and a part feigned retreat toward the outskirts of Yichuan. Although the National Army suffered over 10,000 casualties in that battle, the bandit army also suffered over 17,000 to 18,000 deaths under our fierce artillery fire.</p>
<p>Spring in northern Shaanxi is cold. At the end of February, it was still snowing. After the news of the martyrdom of the two brigade commanders, Zhou and Li, was confirmed, General Liu Kan was filled with anger and personally led Yan (Ming) and Wang (Yingzun) in an attack, braving the snow.</p>
<p>The Two Divisions Attack. With the Yan division on the right and the Wang division on the left, their morale was particularly high, and they advanced like a broken bamboo, invincible along the way. On the morning of March 1st, a staff officer under General Liu Kan said to General Liu, "The bandit troops of Wang * were only recently transferred from southern Jin, and their momentum is strong. They are now hiding southeast of Danyang in southwestern Yichuan. We should use our main force to eliminate this group of bandits, and then go north to pursue and suppress Peng's bandit army. Otherwise, advancing between the rainy areas, because of the disparity in numbers, I fear it will be difficult to achieve a complete victory." General Liu said indignantly, "How can Wang Zhen and his bandits be my opponents? I must defeat Peng's bandits to relieve my anger and avenge the defeat of our troops!" So he advanced towards Aozijie. At noon one day, he arrived at the place, built fortifications, and prepared to advance towards the Yichuan county office the next day. That night, they were suddenly attacked by the bandit army. At that time, our fortifications were built with strong defenses on the east and west sides, while the north and south were not the main focus. The bandit army's Wang Zhen's troops came from the south, and Peng Dehuai's troops descended from the northwest along the mountains, surrounding Aozijie in as many as six layers. After a fierce battle for half the night, the bandit army still failed to break into our positions. Then, the artillery of the bandit Bohai Column bombarded intensely, with shells raining down, forming a sea of fire. The surrounding fortifications were almost leveled.</p>
<p>Repeated Attacks and Killings. After that, two of the surrounding hilltops of Aozijie were lost. Division Commander Yan Ming then led his orderlies and cooks to charge towards the hilltops, attacking the enemy positions with hand grenades, until both men and grenades were exhausted. General Yan then used the last hand grenade to kill himself. The bandit army's encirclement tightened further. General Liu Kan saw that all his subordinates had heroically sacrificed themselves and killed himself with a pistol. It was after midnight, the night wind was howling, and the sky was not yet light.</p>
<p>General Liu Kan and his subordinates and soldiers wrote their heroic epic in this way. Although they died, the elite forces of the bandit army in northern Shaanxi and southern Jin also lost their combat effectiveness after the fierce fighting with General Liu. The Communist bandits' "spring dream" of "recovering Yan'an" on March 19th was also completely shattered. As for the whereabouts of Division Commander Wang Yingzun, some say he died in artillery fire, others say he was captured by the bandits. The rumors are currently conflicting.</p>
<p>Life is immortal, and the lives of revolutionary fighters are even more immortal. Their heroic deeds and heroic sacrifices will be written in the history of the war, and their epic will generate even greater fighting spirit! (Our reporter Zhang Xianzhou)</p>

<p>[Reported by our correspondent in Zhenjiang on the 21st] The continuous rain in Zhenjiang has lasted for more than ten days. Although it has cleared today, it is not yet sunny.

<h3 id="e131">Ancient Relics of More Than a Thousand Years Ago: Yongling Cultural Relics <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>[Aviation dispatch from our correspondent in Chengdu on the 18th] In recent decades, an unprecedented event in the archaeological community was the excavation of the tomb of Wang Jian, the former Shu king—Yongling—by the Sichuan Provincial Museum in the 31st year of the Republic (1942). At that time, it indeed caused a stir among archaeologists. However, due to the eight-year War of Resistance and the subsequent suppression of the rebellion, domestic archaeological research on the code of law and cultural relics from more than a thousand years ago could not be sorted out. Recently, in order to stimulate the domestic cultural circles' new understanding of the value of Yongling cultural relics, the Sichuan Museum held a special "Public Exhibition of Yongling Cultural Relics," which is a rare cultural event in Chengdu in recent years.</p>
<p>Ancient Objects on Display: Sculptures, Booklets, and Posthumous Treasures</p>
<p>This exhibition mainly features funerary objects from the tomb after a period of sorting out. The exhibition site is the former imperial city Zhigong Hall, with ancient objects lined up, a dazzling array. There is a stone statue of Wang Jian, about three feet tall, wearing a crown, robe, and belt, with a high nose and wide forehead, intricately sculpted, and with a solemn appearance. There are several iron-cast statues of prime ministers and military generals, two feet five inches tall, with extremely heroic appearances. There are dozens of jade booklets, five-three condolence booklets and posthumous title booklets, each booklet about one foot long and two inches wide, with metal flower patterns on the edges. The upper part is engraved with characters. Although the moss is mottled, it can still be roughly recited. The text was written in the first year of Guangtian (Wang Jian's reign title, corresponding to the fourth year of Liang Zhenming, 918 AD), recording Wang Yan's experience of moving to the land. The booklets are all placed in exquisite iron boxes. The boxes are deep vermilion in color and engraved with double phoenixes and colorful bird patterns. They are exquisitely carved. Outside there is a golden posthumous treasure, which is inscribed with fourteen characters, "Posthumous Treasure of Emperor Gaozu Shenwu Shengwen Xiaode Minghui," which has been weathered. It is said that there is also a gold Buddha and a gold *shi* each, which can be called fine products, which were snatched away by powerful people after the excavation.</p>
<p>Cultural Relics System: Represents Chinese Civilization</p>
<p>The exhibited cultural relics are all ancient objects from more than a thousand years ago. According to research, Wang Jian was the former Shu king of the Five Dynasties. The "History of the Five Dynasties" records: "Zhu Wen, the ancestor of the Liang Dynasty, usurped the throne of the Tang Dynasty by killing Emperor Zhaoxuan in the second year of Tang Tianyou and named the first year of Kai Ping. Wang Jian of Sichuan was proclaimed 'Emperor of Great Shu' in that year and changed his reign title to Wucheng." It also records: "...Until June of the first year of Guangtian," Shu "'Taowu' said: 'In June of the first year of Guangtian, Wang Jian died at the age of seventy-two and was buried in Yongling.'" "Chengdu Wenlei" and Lu Fangweng's poems all indicate that Yongling—Wang Jian's tomb—is in the western suburbs of Chengdu. However, Cao Xuequan's "Records of Famous Places in Sichuan" of the Ming Dynasty pointed out that it was Sima Xiangru's Qin Terrace, which later became a popular scenic spot in Chengdu. In the second year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1910), it was once excavated by villagers. In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Baocheng Railway Materials Factory excavated an air-raid shelter on the banks of the river, and this tomb was discovered. Subsequently, due to the constraints and opposition of local people, the Sichuan Provincial Antiquities Preservation Association and the museum did not cooperate until the 31st year (1942) to carry out the excavation project. The 33rd year (1944) of the project was announced to be completed, and this exhibition was the first to be held formally.</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty was the most prosperous period of Chinese civilization. At that time, the country was in turmoil, but Sichuan was uniquely stable and prosperous in the world. Therefore, the Wang (Jian) and Meng (Zhixiang) era of the Former and Later Shu Dynasties was the most prosperous period in Sichuan's history. The cultural and artifact system at that time can indeed represent most of the civilization of the most prosperous era of the Chinese nation. Although this exhibition is small in scale, after visiting it, the reporter believes that it is valuable for the domestic archaeological community to refer to. In today's turbulent times, it is still a major cultural event. (Our reporter Zhou Xueduan)</p>

<p>[Reported by our Jiayu correspondent on the 21st] Ye, the owner of a incense and candle shop on Zhong'an Bridge in the eastern market of the town of Yeyuan under the county, had a quarrel with his wife a few days ago.

According to the moving government's regulations, the Chinese flag can only be raised on a "special holiday," and even on a "holiday," the Chinese flag must be raised together with the Siamese flag.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from our correspondent in Paris on the 14th] Painter Zhang Ziyu, a graduate of the French National Higher School of Fine Arts, whose works have won many awards, recently plans to return to China and is willing to work in the domestic art world. It is said that the French National Higher School of Fine Arts is the most famous art school in Europe, founded in the fifteenth century. Very few Chinese students have graduated from the school.

<p>[Our dispatch from Nanjing] A gentleman from the Ministry of Education recently received a letter from a friend in Xinjiang describing the real situation of the college's turmoil, briefly recorded as follows: Xinjiang College was reorganized from the Russian-language and political science school founded by Chairman Yang Zengxin, and has a history of more than ten years. Last spring, there were only a dozen students, and the expenses were tight, relying on the support of General Zhang Zhizhong. In April last year, the reorganization resumed classes, and Bauerhan was appointed as the president. At that time, Bauer hired Xia Weihai, Wang Zengyi, Wang Yunzhuang, Gu Zilian, etc. as professors, and the school's affairs were progressing day by day. Later, President Bauer served as a member of the National Government, and school affairs were taken over by Tu Zhi. Tu took advantage of Wang Yunzhuang's trip to Beijing on Bauer's orders to contact the Ministry of Education for official business, and then rehired Hu Zeyi and others as professors, excluding the professors previously hired by Bauer, resulting in disputes between the two parties, which involved litigation in court. Recently, the court punished Hu Zeyi and others according to the provisions of the criminal law for harming the reputation of others, and Hu et al. asked Tu Zhi to post an announcement approving the resignation of Professor Wang Yunzhuang and others, refusing Wang Yunzhuang to return to the school. Wang filed a counter-evidence because he had not resigned. The turmoil of mutual lawsuits has not yet subsided.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Since its establishment, Suzhou Industrial College has been in existence for over forty years, producing numerous talents who are well-known in society. Due to the severe destruction of various constructions during the war, they urgently need to be restored, and there is an increasing demand for engineering talents. The Shanghai Alumni Association of the school, in view of this, has proposed to upgrade it to an institute of technology. In December of last year, it jointly organized dozens of alumni from Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and other places, including Ye Xiufeng, to petition the province and hold a small exhibition of alumni achievements to show the general situation of serving society, which was well received by all sectors. At that time, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Assembly allowed the school to be upgraded to a college as long as it enriched its content and equipment, so as to reserve talents. It is recently learned that more than 20 alumni including, Zeng Shirong, Guo Qiqing, Wu Wenhua, Zhu Wenhuan, and Tong Lanfu have donated equipment worth approximately 20 billion yuan in order for their alma mater to be upgraded to an independent college as soon as possible to cooperate with the restoration project. They have sent separate telegrams to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Provincial Assembly, and the Provincial Department of Education, attaching a list of the equipment donated to their alma mater, and are seeking approval to upgrade the school to an independent institute of technology in the second half of the year to meet the urgent needs and create great achievements. It is heard that the provincial authorities may approve it.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Social Affairs Bureau Resumes Rice Distribution Yesterday, Adjusting the Market with Flexible Methods, North and South Market Prices Return to Small Amounts of 50,000 to 100,000 <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, seeing that rice prices have been rising again in recent days and that rice allocation for households in the city is still smooth, but in order to thoroughly clarify the market's profiteering atmosphere and strengthen the supply of food rice, specially resumed selling food rice yesterday. The total amount of early rice was 1135 you, with a matching price of 3.6 million per stone, and 100 stones of Wuxian rice, with a matching price of 3.2 million yuan. In order to quickly ship out of the warehouse, the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Grain Department announced another location for rice distribution, so as to be effective quickly. Due to the continuous rainy weather in recent days, sales were not smooth, and the market arrival was plentiful, reaching 16,073 stones and 5 dou. Therefore, yesterday's rice market was sluggish. Other grains also showed a downward trend. White japonica medium goods were 3.85 million yuan, sheep xiang medium goods were 3.8 million, early rice was 3.7 million, and white yuan was 3.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>It is reported that the People's Mediation Association has a large amount of food rice stored in the warehouse, intending to sell it in the market, but not selling it on a daily basis, but adopting a flexible method, depending on the needs of the market, so as not to affect the source of food rice.</p>
<p>Flour fell with the price of rice. The morning opening was sluggish. The opening price for warship grade was the closing price of last week, which once reached a high of 1.6 million, but eventually fell back to 1.575 million yuan at the close. Lao Che was 1.58 million, and Jiancheng, Red Bee, etc. each fell by 230,000 yuan. Bran fell by 5,000, and wheat was 2.25 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains were consistently firm, especially corn and red sorghum, which rose sharply under the all-out purchase of the Qing Gang. The former rose sharply by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and the latter rose strongly by 200,000 yuan. Selected Qing goods have been silent for a long time, also causing a surge of 200,000 yuan. Soybeans were stable, but Pinghu Du soybeans rose by 100,000 yuan, and extra-coarse ones were as high as 2.63 million yuan. Sesame seeds were rarely released, and rose by 200,000 yuan. Raw kernels stopped buying, falling by more than 100,000 yuan alone.</p>
<p>Edible oil opened flat, but it immediately turned firm because there were few releases and many additions from the street. Oil mills rarely opened. Soybean oil was all in return transactions, and the closing price rose by 50,000 yuan. Dayou soybean oil knocked on the 8 million yuan mark, and raw oil rose more strongly, because there were not many arrivals. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil was 9.65 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil and raw rapeseed oil were each 50,000 yuan. Large and small car sesame oil rose sharply by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cakes initially fell and then rose, but eventually remained low by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Cotton Allocation for Yarn and Cloth Exchange: Yarn Control Committee Drafts Proposal to Maintain Factory Production <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Before the official announcement of the detailed rules for cotton yarn substitute spinning, the Yarn Control Committee, in order to enable various factories to maintain production, intends to approve individual applications from factories for the allocation of raw cotton. The allocated raw cotton is intended to be exchanged for yarn and cloth produced by the factories. To this end, the committee specifically passed a proposal at a recent extraordinary committee meeting, detailing the review procedures for yarn factories applying for cotton allocation. The main points are as follows: Draft of simplified rules for yarn factories applying for cotton allocation: Any yarn factory in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region with more than 3,000 spindles, whose actual inventory of cotton is insufficient for one month's use, may apply to the committee for cotton allocation in exchange for cotton yarn or cotton cloth produced by the factory. After the committee dispatches personnel to verify the situation, the committee will, with reference to the quality and quantity of raw cotton currently held by the committee, allocate cotton to each factory separately, with the quantity of cotton allocated each time limited to one month's usage. Factories that have previously spun government cotton yarn on behalf of the government and have fully complied with regulations and have excellent creditworthiness will be given priority in the allocation of raw cotton as an incentive. Those who do not comply with government regulations or whose procedures for delivering spun yarn are not clear will not be allocated cotton for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Public Sentiment Weak: Downstream of Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were due to the excessive surge in prices last week, and the market situation in other ports was reversed, so the merchants were generally watching. Also, it was the time for the Textile Construction Company to open yarn, and the industry's capital was tight, and the public sentiment was weak. Many bulls started to sell, and the market price turned sharply downwards.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at 223 million yuan and fell all the way to 210 million yuan at the close, a sharp drop of 17 million yuan compared to last weekend. 40-count and 32-count yarns each fell by 7 million to 12 million yuan.</p>
<p>Although there was a lot of support for 21-count Double Horse single yarn, it still fell sharply by 16 million yuan due to the fact that those in the industry who were short on funds seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, and it ended at a low price of 120 million yuan. Now Double Horse yarn has also plummeted by 17 million yuan. In addition, 10-count, 16-count, and 20-count coarse yarns all fell back by about 10% to 15%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's brocade cloth market conditions were such that, when the market opened in the morning, there were rumors that the US exchange rate would rise again, and the buying interest was still strong, and all goods were hovering at hard prices. Leading fine cloth once surged to 449 million yuan, but then it was heard that the rumors were false, and the bulls were thinking about risks at high positions. At the same time, the capital was still tight, and they competed to sell. Retail investors followed suit and the merchants stood by and watched. The trend was dull. Seeing the changes in the environment, the major players were unable to support it, so the selling sentiment turned stronger and the asking prices went downstream.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was mostly flat and sluggish due to sluggish actual sales. However, spot four-and-a-half white sugar was initially flat and then tight due to shortage.

<p>Opening Price 500,000 Yuan per Catty</p>
<p>Yesterday, new Longjing tea before the Qingming Festival from the Wenzhou production area was brought in by merchants for reporting. The local industry players are very concerned. The cargo owner thinks that it is the first time to see new tea, and the goods are scarce and expensive. He takes the opportunity to hold up the price and the opening price is surprisingly high, shouting 500,000 yuan per catty. This is almost four to five times stronger than in previous years.</p>
<p>It is found that Hangzhou chrysanthemums have been lively in price and out of the ordinary since the recovery of buying interest from Guangdong merchants. As for the tea market situation, the local and foreign merchants still absorb the domestic sales patterns. At the same time, exporters are still interested in export tea, so the process is still good, but the opening transactions are still few due to the scarcity of goods and the lack of supply.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that since the implementation of the measures for the deposit and remittance of public funds of military and government agencies, various national banks have inevitably deposited and remitted public funds of military and government agencies due to practical difficulties. Now, the 359th meeting of the board of directors of the Joint Treasury has resolved that the public funds of military and government agencies should be deposited in the Central Bank uniformly. The public funds currently deposited in various bank branches should be transferred to the Central Bank in full, and all the funds balances that should be transferred to the Central Bank due to the transfer of such deposits, resulting in insufficient cash turnover, can be provided by the Central Bank to various bank branches. As for the funds of state-owned enterprises, they can be deposited by various bank branches in accordance with their professional characteristics, and after consultation with the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and various bank branches, they should be reported to the Joint Treasury for record and decision, and implemented in stages.</p>
<p>The first phase: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other six cities will be completed by the end of March. The second phase: all other cities will be completed before April 15. The third phase: all places without a Central Bank but with other national bank branches acting as treasury agents will be limited to transferring the part of the treasury funds deposited in the agent bank branch before the end of April. The transfer procedures should be discussed with the local bank branches, and the bank branches should submit a list of the deposit balances of all military and government agencies on the deadline, and transfer the seals of the depositors to the Central Bank for special deposit custody. The interest will be handled after the decision is made and notified later. After various bank branches transfer the deposits of military and government agencies to the Central Bank, they can be given the same amount of overdraft. From now on, various bank branches must absolutely not accept the public funds of military and government agencies by any means.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Eve of the Birth of Greek Philosophy <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>Humans are born into a natural environment, and they come into contact with nature. Natural things, such as the sky, the earth, mountains, rivers, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, etc., on the one hand, oppress them in life, and on the other hand, arouse their curiosity. They are startled by oppression and doubtful by curiosity. These two kinds of psychology are the fuse of knowledge.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks initially solved the problems of surprise and doubt through mythical religion. Their abilities were weak, and they were oppressed and dazzled by the natural world. Unable to do anything about it, they wanted to invite some supernatural gods to resist nature; moreover, lacking exploratory experience, they sought simple means, like performing magic, to solve their problems. Besides, although their psychology of awe and doubt arose simultaneously, due to the pressing needs of life, awe ultimately outweighed doubt; therefore, they needed something powerful enough to subdue the wanton power of the natural world, and their panicked minds could find some comfort in it. This is the reason for the emergence of the mythical religion of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>Their mythical religion was polytheistic and anthropomorphic. What is meant by anthropomorphic? It means believing that gods are like humans: they have the organization of families, societies, and countries, so they also have relationships of rulers and subjects, fathers and sons, husbands and wives, brothers and friends; they have emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, hate, and desire, so they also have rewards and punishments. In short, the virtues of humans are all possessed by gods, and the ugliness of humans is also fully present in gods, only that the power of gods far exceeds that of humans, and even everything in nature is created and managed by them. The concept of anthropomorphism was the most common in primitive times, so a Greek philosopher said that if cattle and horses had religions, the God in their minds would definitely be a cow and a horse. This kind of concept certainly comes from a narrow view from the bottom of a well, but it can also reveal another psychology of humans at that time; they were helpless against the oppression of the natural world, and they wished they could bring out another group of people much stronger than themselves, i.e., the gods they imagined, to resist nature. Not only could they resist, but everything in nature was simply created and managed by them. As long as they were properly appeased, the wanton power of nature could be subdued, and they themselves would not have to worry anymore.</p>
<p>However, this kind of religion, although it can comfort the mind of fear for a time, cannot satisfy the heart of curiosity forever. Moreover, anthropomorphic gods, being as base, filthy, and evil as humans, and further endowed with supreme authority, their oppression of human emotions is no less than the unsatisfactory things in nature. So, to resist the wanton power of nature, to exchange it for the wanton power of theocracy, wouldn't that be replacing violence with violence? Thus, the ancient Greeks came to a new realization: to resist the oppression of nature, one cannot seek solutions outside of nature. One must understand nature itself, seek the causes of its oppression within its scope, and then control the cause to govern the effect, so that human power can be effective. This is the view of "human knowledge and power unite" of Bacon later, and it is also the beginning of the spirit of what he called "obeying nature to control nature." Under this new realization of view and spirit, Greek philosophy was born.</p>
<p>The transition from mythical religion to philosophy is a turning point in Western culture, and it has been developing along one path from that time to the present. What is this path? It is reason. Therefore, the birth of Greek philosophy can be regarded as the beginning of Westerners using their reason to do excavation work in the natural world.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Schopenhauer's Theory of Suicide <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Xiong</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, one can see news of suicide at any time. Today it is Mr. Zhang's suicide, tomorrow it is Mr. Li's suicide. Suicide seems to be contagious. As long as newspapers exaggerate, sympathize, or even praise it, suicide can increase. In this year of national poverty and frequent turmoil, everyone feels the difficulty of survival, and suicide may be the simplest way to solve life problems. The high number of suicide cases currently is certainly a major reason for this.</p>
<p>Suicide is a social pathology, and in any case, it is certainly not a blessing for society. But is the act of suicide justified? Is suicide a criminal act? In other words, from an ethical or moral standpoint, do we have legitimate reasons to oppose suicide? The 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer has a theory of suicide. This article intends to introduce his theory and then briefly criticize it.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer's theory is contradictory on the surface. On the one hand, he sympathizes with suicide, and on the other hand, he opposes it. From one point of view, he believes that suicide is justified. Suicide is by no means a criminal act. We want to know whether suicide is a criminal act, and our own moral emotions can determine it. When we hear that someone we know has committed murder, theft, or fraud, what are our emotions? And when we hear that someone we know has committed suicide, what are our emotions? Regarding the former event, we will definitely have feelings of moral anger, and we will definitely hate this person very much, and we will definitely demand punishment and revenge. But regarding the latter event, our emotions are different. Our emotions are sorrow and sympathy, mixed with the thought of admiring his courage. Can we say that the latter event is the same as the former event, and both are criminal acts? It can be seen from our moral emotions that suicide is by no means a crime. The fact that suicide is not a crime can also be fully proven from the statements and actions of sages and heroes, both ancient and modern, in China and abroad. In the Bible, whether the Old Testament or the New Testament, there is no explicit prohibition of suicide. Opposing suicide is only the personal opinion and prejudice of religious figures. An ancient Roman writer, Pliny, once said: "Even God is not possible in all events; for if his will is to die, he cannot accomplish his own death, but in all the sufferings of our life in the world, death is the best gift that God has given to mankind." As for the events of the ancients taking suicide as an honor, there are even more unknown. Indians even regard suicide as a religious act. Playwrights' eulogies of suicide are also common both in China and abroad. What reason do we have to oppose suicide? So, if the law prohibits suicide, this is the most ridiculous event. Because what punishment can be added to a person who is not afraid of death? Suicide is a human right. In addition to his own life and body, what else does each person have that is more inviolable?</p>
<p>But from another point of view, Schopenhauer opposes suicide. Schopenhauer's opposition to suicide is not to oppose it as a criminal act, but to oppose it as not a good means of denying life. According to Schopenhauer's philosophy, human life is full of pain and sin. And the source of this life is due to the will, due to the will to live. We want to eliminate human pain and sin, we must deny the will to live. However, to deny the will to live, this is not what suicide can achieve its purpose. Suicide is not a negation of the will to live, on the contrary, this is the most affirmation of the will to live. The negation of the will to live is not constituted by escaping the pain of life, but by escaping happiness. When a suicide destroys his existence as an individual, he does not destroy his will to live. The suicide's will to live is very strong. If he has the ability to satisfy himself, if he can affirm his will to resist the forces of the environment, he also intends to survive. Only because the power of the environment is too strong, he cannot resist it, then he commits suicide. Therefore, the suicide's deep intention is to live rather than to die. Although he destroyed the body. This will to live still exists. Suicide is not the liberation of life, we must go beyond life, we must deny life, we should find other means, and we should not take suicide as a means. This is Schopenhauer's main reason for opposing suicide. Moreover, Schopenhauer believes that suicide is also a clumsy experiment. He said: "Suicide can also be regarded as an experiment, an experiment in which people want to ask nature a question, and force nature to answer it. The question is: What changes will death bring to human existence and human insight into natural things? This is a clumsy experiment, because it eliminates both the person who asks the question and the person who is waiting for the answer."</p>
<p>The above is simply the theory of suicide of this person. Whether he sympathizes with suicide or opposes suicide, his main errors are two: one is to regard life as personal, and the other is to regard life as full of pain and sin. Regarding life as personal, the individual has the right to dispose of it, and suicide is justified. But in fact, life is definitely not just personal. Life must have a source. From the source of life, from the moment we are born, life is not personal, but contains the blood and achievements of parents and ancestors. And in the growth of life, the achievements of society and the nation are even more indispensable factors. Without the assistance of society and the nation, life cannot grow. Therefore, a grown life is by no means unique to the individual, but is shared by the society and the nation. In this way, the individual does not have the freedom to dispose of it, and suicide becomes unjustified. Secondly, regarding life as full of pain and sin, then eliminating pain and sin is naturally justified. However, although life has pain and sin, life is definitely not just pain and sin. To say that life is full of pain and sin, or to say that life is more painful than happy and sin is more than good, this is not a conclusion based on any scientific statistics, but only a personal prejudice, or a conclusion based on the fewest examples. Schopenhauer had such a judgment based on his personal limited observation and neglecting the other side of life. If we look at life from the bright side and expand the scope of our observation, we may come to the opposite conclusion to Schopenhauer's. So we can never regard Schopenhauer's conclusion as absolutely correct, therefore we cannot agree with his theory of suicide. We must know that for those who commit suicide, we can naturally feel sadness and sympathy, but sadness and sympathy are not moral approval. Even a heinous murderer, at the moment of his execution, we can also feel sadness or sympathy, can we regard this emotion as moral approval? Sadness and sympathy are one thing, and moral approval is another, and the two cannot be confused. We can feel sorry for suicides, we can sympathize with suicides, but generally speaking (there are exceptions), we cannot regard the behavior of suicides as justified. This is the author's conclusion.</p>

<p>— One Finger</p>
<p>Today there are common sayings: "spiritual civilization" and "material civilization." These two terms are familiar to the ears of our countrymen, and they know them well, but those who can explain them in detail are rare. However, if asked about the nature of these two and how they relate to the survival of a country or a nation, they often remain at a loss, unable to find their direction. Therefore, more than ten years ago, one or two giants in academic circles had the theory of "complete Westernization."</p>
<p>What is so-called spiritual civilization but the philosophy, science, art, religion, ethics, and politics of a country or a nation? And what is so-called material civilization but the material productions of its people, which are for utilitarianism and improving people's livelihood. The former is that by which a country and a nation survive, and that by which they are distinguished from other countries and other nations; if it falls to the ground, the country and the nation will perish. The latter, including wealth and power, is something that different countries and different nations do not necessarily differ in, and can be borrowed and used. Being inferior in the latter, a country or a nation may be temporarily subjected to other countries or other nations, but will not lead to ultimate disaster; if it is inferior in the former and perishes, it will be a disaster that cannot be reversed for ten thousand eons, and the tragedy of humanity is worse than this.</p>
<p>If spiritual civilization is profound, and material civilization has not yet reached it, then one can peddle to others and reap the benefits of utilitarianism and improving people's livelihood. Spiritual civilization is not like that, it is not so easy to borrow from others. The material civilization of the Japanese, such as Western clothes and leather shoes, can be worn by those with deep eye sockets and high noses, and can also be worn by our descendants of Yan and Huang. To borrow the spiritual civilization of others, first, one cannot completely abandon what one has in common and only seek from others, and second, one cannot take from others without making compromises. The matter lies in carefully measuring one's own shortcomings, picking up others' strengths to make up for them; and what is picked up for compensation must be compatible with what one already has, and not mutually exclusive. For example, if a body is weak and seeks medical treatment, the doctor will never teach him to discard his old body, but will carefully diagnose where his weakness lies and prescribe tonics; however, there are many tonics, and if they are not something that the person's body can tolerate, even if they are administered, it will be useless, and may even be harmful, so one must be careful. Then, it can be seen that the argument of those who advocate complete Westernization is not relevant to reality.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Everyman's Responsibility on the Issue of Atomic Energy <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Li Lian Tai Er, Translated by Chen Zhuo Ru</p>
<p>The basic goal of the reactor should be understood by the public, because other important knowledge about atomic energy work can be derived from this. If a person understands these three points, he can understand why the money and time spent on manufacturing and improving weapons such as the atomic bomb can directly help the development of industrial power. This has been said more than once or twice. The paths of manufacturing atomic bombs and using the power of the atomic nucleus for construction are 85 percent the same.</p>
<p>Power is naturally the most dazzling application of atomic energy, but it is still impossible now, and it is not possible to turn a corner. In two or three years, we may have an atomic energy power plant for demonstration or experimentation—we can use it to light up lights and tow machines. Some scientists and engineers say that in ten years, we may have a fairly practical and economical atomic power machine. But even so, in ten years, atomic power will still not be cheap.</p>
<p>The third point of the reciprocating machine—that is, the generation of neutrons—the benefits it produces are hard to anticipate even for the most imaginative cartoonists. This reactor may produce substances with properties completely unknown today by bombarding various substances with neutrons. Among these substances, some can enable us to use this reactor as a source of power, and may also be very important for ordinary power machines.</p>
<p>The by-product research of atomic energy development may have remarkable results. For example, part of the atomic energy research work is about [sic] Dai, which has opened up a new world in chemistry, namely Fluorocarbons. Some people say that its future hope can be compared with atomic energy.</p>
<p>Seeking new ways out for young people, seeking new hope for patients, seeking new understanding of science for peaceful undertakings—these are some of the items on the agenda for the present and the near future.</p>
<p>But these things—and some others I could mention—are only a start. The door of knowledge has just been opened a little. No one can predict what changes will come after knowing the details of matter. We must remember that every organism is also made up of atoms, and the atomic energy we are talking about is also in these atoms. We must also remember that all matter, such as the paper on which these words are printed, the chair you are sitting on, the mountains and the sea, are all made up of atoms and atomic nuclei.</p>
<p>Therefore, the study of atomic energy allows us to know the nature of the world in which we live. The important thing is not only to understand how the concrete effects of these basic quantities of knowledge may produce, which is naturally very dazzling, but also to know what important changes these knowledge will bring—these changes are bound to bring.</p>
<p>What we are concerned about is not that change will come. This is what we are used to seeing today. We like change. What we are concerned about is that these changes can be coordinated with our lives, it [sic] does not hinder our personal freedom, we [sic] should take the initiative to control the impact of [sic] this [sic] kind of [sic] Ming on all aspects of society, life, agricultural education, industry and military [sic] degree.</p>
<p>The original science will cause a large group of [sic] new inventions in other aspects: this has already started and will be expanded. But the people should not let these technical developments jump over their party holdings. If so, the democratic ideal is over. In the final analysis, it should be as follows.</p>
<p>(1) We must not relax at all until mankind will not use atomic energy for destructive and private purposes;</p>
<p>(2) (Directly and primarily related) We must strive to encourage the existing inventions of atomic energy, and the new inventions that may come in the future, to be applied to some aspects that are beneficial to the eight categories and in line with humanitarian ideals.</p>
<p>The realistic and difficult problem to solve is: which aromatic surface do we use this ever-increasing new knowledge to?</p>
<p>What is needed to solve this major problem is not the judgment of experts, because this is no longer a scientific matter, but the humanitarian experience and conscience of the prophets and seers in hundreds and thousands of communities in the country. There is no better way to make judgments in these areas than the common sense of an informed public.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why every citizen should know the basic facts of atomic energy. One of the reasons is that we want to know what kind of program can make international control of atomic energy effective. That is, what Secretary of State Marshall said can "eliminate the demons of that destructive war." Or what kind of plan is ineffective, but is: "deceiving the people of the world."</p>
<p>Weakening the security of the country and delaying research on the treatment of cancer, there is nothing more than allowing the ignorant and the politician's organization to become a force to manipulate science and scientists. The most effective way to prevent the harm of those who are ignorant and shallow-minded and selfish in vain is an enlightened public. The people should be careful of their public servants. But the people must know the true facts, then their views will have power.</p>
<p>The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission is legally responsible for providing the public with knowledge of atomic energy. We hope to do our best to fulfill this responsibility. In the current situation, a lot of technical news has to be kept secret and is very well guarded. The Commission naturally has to fulfill its responsibility for guidance in this area, and sometimes it has to provide the public with this new knowledge. But all news about public issues has been opened as much as possible.</p>
<p>If a person wants to know a little more specialized knowledge, he can go to a nearby university to find it. Regarding public issues, universities and middle schools should have people collect and briefly describe the main facts for use by civic groups. Local libraries are naturally also an important source.</p>
<p>I hope that the people of the whole country can understand the facts and concepts of this issue that is closely related to us. I think that one day in the future, everyone will understand Geigen meters, radioactive isotopes, the Baruch plan, Alpha particles, neutron absorption, nuclear reactors, etc., just like engines, X-rays, long and short waves, vitamins, etc. are familiar to everyone today. The knowledge of atomic energy is new, but the new books are also increasing day by day, and there will always be someone writing atomic energy textbooks for universities and middle schools, so that this school will be moved from the laboratory to everyone's common sense.</p>
<p>Only when the people are enthusiastic about this issue and understand its essence, can we avoid disasters and achieve true progress. Only when the people study and are careful, can this force have good results. The power of democracy lies in the conscience and good opportunity of the public.

<h3 id="e192">Bosanquet on Thought and Freedom <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Ru</p>
<p>If, according to Bosanquet's intention, thought is regarded as the complete virtue of the healthy movement of the human heart, then it contains all the conscious activities of mankind, and is expressed in "all the experiences of a rational animal, or in every experience." A free act is an act that can receive and release, and is self-aware and autonomous. The mere influence of body on body does not constitute the behavior of a creative person. To be an active agent is to be a free cause, not a natural cause; that is, he must transform himself according to his nature and accumulation, expand himself, break through his present boundaries and be in communication with heaven and earth, and all things are one; turn "all strangers into the closest relatives, and turn things that are seemingly unrelated into things that are fundamentally closely related: in this way, affirming the self in the non-self, or saying that transcending the boundaries of the self and the non-self to reach a self-sufficient self, at this time the self is not a link in the natural order, but a supernatural subject. But to be such a free subject, one obviously cannot allow blind desires to run rampant, but must infiltrate your will into what the Greek philosophers called reason, wisdom, or what Bosanquet called thought, and turn it into what our Confucian scholars called "manifest virtue."</p>
<p>The apparent incompatibility of thought and freedom of will is due to the view of thought as a separate faculty, unrelated to other faculties of the human heart: merely the intellect of abstract reasoning. Under such a separate view, thought is not only incompatible with will and emotion, but also separated from the talents of direct experience, intuition; therefore, the ideal has become a dead thing that cannot understand the Tao above, and cannot feel things below.</p>
<p>However, in Bosanquet's view, the procedures of abstract, speculative judgment and reasoning are not sufficient to exhaust the nature of thought. Deduction is only one aspect of thought. Thought also has an intuitive aspect. "The ultimate intention of thought is not abstract generalization, but to construct a world," that is to say, it not only analyzes but also synthesizes, it not only distinguishes parts, but also recognizes the necessary connection between parts, the spirit of the whole. It is not limited to the givens of sensation, it must clarify the meaning of the givens of sensation and transcend reality: from near to far, from small to large, from dark to light, from blocked to unblocked, from part to whole, from meaningless to meaningful, from withered to lively, from stagnant to lively, from deficient to complete, from turbulent to stable, from contradictory to harmonious. Therefore, "the true function of thought is to establish, to give meaning, to inspire, to be lively. Its object is not the decaying remains of sensation, but a living world." However, true thought, of course, is not limited to the givens of sensation, but it is not separated from the givens of sensation; although it does not drown in reality, it does not abandon reality; it is only innovation, only transcendence, not building pavilions in the void. The nature of thought lies in its process of self-transcendence or ideality starting from reality. The reason why it can be united with the concept of freedom also lies in this transcendent or expansive ideality of turning the unfamiliar into the familiar, and affirming the self from the non-self. Because free action expresses the same transcendent spirit as the activity of thought. They all want to transcend their starting point and find a settlement in this transcendent activity. It is impossible to unite with the great whole without transcendence and exhaust the nature of the subject of thought and action, so it is impossible to get settled without transcendence. Transcendence and settlement go hand in hand, just as freedom and thought are inseparable. Hegel said: "Those who speak of freedom and reject thought do not know what they are talking about." But what is meant by thought here refers to the unobstructed function of the intelligent and wise mind, which is completely different from picking up a part of knowledge, or clinging to the past or trending to the new, eating without digesting, being stubborn and not understanding, thus being trapped in a bottomless abyss, a wall of ten thousand blades, a bond that cannot be untied for thousands of years, and ultimately losing one's true life, not realizing it until death. This point will be discussed separately.</p>

<p>Modern Western Thoughts (Middle)</p>
<p>(3) Regarding modern Western philosophy of idealism, in terms of its method of thinking, it can be divided into two major schools. One is the British school, founded by Locke. The other is the Continental school, founded by the Frenchman Descartes (1596-1650) and reaching its peak with the German Kant (1724-1804). The British school is rooted in the material sciences, values experience, emphasizes induction, and conducts individual studies on different problems. The Continental school is based on mathematics, mathematical propositions are a priori, not derived from empirical induction, so it emphasizes pure thinking and devalues perception. The British school believes in the experimental method, emphasizes effect, and values utilitarianism. The Continental school holds idealism, emphasizes motivation and rejects utilitarian concepts. In terms of academic style, the British school tends towards meticulous detail, while the Continental school tends towards towering structures, with clearly distinct appearances. The 18th century was dominated by the British empiricist school, which spread to France through the efforts of Voltaire (1694-1778), and the founding fathers of the United States also admired Locke's doctrines. Towards the end of the 18th century, Kant's banner swept across continental Europe, but British philosophy was little influenced by it. Kant's theory of opposites complementing each other is actually the blueprint for Hegel's dialectic. Kant's political thought resonates with liberalism, and Kant also said that human nature has its own purpose, and is not a tool for others, greatly advocating the doctrine of human rights. Kant's theory was not tolerated by the Nazi government for this reason. Kant believed that the whole should be more important than the part, and judging by this, the organization of the United Nations after the war should have a lofty status. Russell believes that excessive emphasis on national rights makes international cooperation impossible. The difference between idealism and liberalism lies in their ethics, with one school emphasizing motivation and the other emphasizing utility. Russell believes that the spirit of individual pursuit of truth is necessary, but it should not be taken to extremes to the point of self-righteousness. Morality cannot only emphasize motivation, and effect should also be considered. Russell's intention is that it is necessary to both rectify the righteous and seek its benefit, and to understand its principles and calculate its merits. There are various different interests in politics, and statesmen should be able to harmonize and compromise among them. This is the essence of utilitarianism, and the study of modern social sciences is actually derived from this.</p>
<p>(4) Utilitarianism. The philosophical radical school in 19th-century Britain was one of the currents of liberalism. This school considered Bentham (1648-1832) as its champion. After the Industrial Revolution, due to machine production, the population concentrated in cities, giving rise to various social problems. Bentham first proposed the principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number, which is known as utilitarianism. Bentham wanted to replace religion with law, believing that the purpose of law and social institutions was to reconcile private and public interests, and that there was no freedom without law. He advocated the abolition of the aristocracy and the implementation of full democracy, including women's suffrage. At the same time, Ricardo (1772-1823) said that the exchange value of commodities was due to labor, creating a theoretical prelude to the rise of the labor movement. Since the 19th century, British social legislation policy has been most influenced by this school. However, this school is nominally a philosophical radical school, but in reality, it is still a moderate revolutionary group. On the one hand, they seek happiness for the majority of people, and on the other hand, they still defend private property, which is completely different from Marxism, which advocates the absolute abolition of private property. The policies implemented by the British Labour Party now uphold social justice, strive for world security, and do not infringe on the basic rights of citizens. They only restrict private property and do not completely abolish it, and they want to balance economic equality and political freedom. This British-style socialism is really the result of the gradual evolution of traditional thought since Locke and Bentham.</p>
<p>(5) Communism. The theory of communism was established by Marx, hence it is also called Marxism. Marx (Karl Marx, 1818-1883) was born in Germany and lived in Britain. His materialist view of history combines the dialectic of the German Hegel and the doctrines of the British empiricist school. What Marx called matter refers to the relationship between people and things, that is, the mode of production, or economic life. Marx adopted Hegel's formula of proof, but said that the great force driving the universe is not spirit but matter. Russell himself claimed to be influenced by Marx's historical materialism, saying that there is indeed great truth in it, but that it has its drawbacks when taken to extremes. Because society includes politics, economy and many other aspects, property is only one aspect, and the more precise and specialized the problem, the less the effect of economic factors. The philosophical distance between Marx and the liberals is not great, but there is a significant difference in practical politics. Marxism advocates class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, raises the banner of communism, and strives to advocate the nationalization of land and capital. Later, it was elaborated by Lenin and Stalin and put into practice. The Soviet revolution in 1919 was the first time that the proletariat seized power, which was obviously different from the general democracy based on private property. Russell and Dewey both traveled to Soviet Russia. Dewey did not approve of Marx's theory, saying that it was close to theology, and that the relationship between the people and the state was like that between Catholics and the church. Dewey also opposed violent revolution, saying that it would lead to dictatorship. Russell claimed that he and Dewey had the same feeling on this point. Russell's aim is to give equal weight to political human rights and economic human rights. He hates the concept of the proletariat taking power and existing either as master or as slave. The ultimate goal of communism is also the harmony of politics and economy, but the realization of this harmony may have to wait for the distant future. In short, although communism and romanticism have different origins, they later converged and resonated with each other. Due to the intensity of thought, they tend towards political totalitarianism. However, Marx advocated the dictatorship of the proletariat, but had no sense of racial superiority, which is different from the Nietzschean school.</p>

<h3 id="e194">On Concealing Evil and Promoting Good <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>Concealing evil and promoting good seems to have become the nature of Chinese people. Therefore, when you open the obituary sent by someone, if it is said to be a eulogy, the deceased must be a perfect person of the generation, piling all the virtues on the parents, as if the end of this person's life is not a family's grief, but a loss to the world in general. In fact, even the great men of the world, their lives are multifaceted, maybe he once stole something, or "climbed over the wall of the eastern neighbor and deflowered his virgin". Therefore, flattering epitaphs and similar writings have long been denied their value. Its content certainly wants to "convey" a person, but it becomes a kind of patterned sculpture, not a vivid and colorful portrayal.</p>
<p>This is still constrained by the reluctance to wash dirty linen in public. When a filial son or grandson writes, how can he offend his ancestors? Franklin said, "Write the injuries in the sand, and the benefits on marble." People in the 19th century may still be in an environment of "improving social customs." Extrapolating its meaning, it is nothing more than concealing evil and promoting good. However, if it is to be regarded as a virtue, there should be a limit, that is, the starting point of concealing evil and promoting good is for others, not for oneself. Even in an autocratic era, the emperor still had to come up with a set of words to deceive the people, "The common people are innocent, the sin lies with me." In today's idiom, it is "self-criticism." This is not a virtue, but involves one's style and cultivation. If what Franklin said above is correct, my estimate is that it is the attitude towards people in a peaceful era. If it is a chaotic world today, I think it should be reversed as the guiding principle for oneself, that is, to write the benefits in the sand and the injuries on the marble. This piece of marble is your conscience. Often rubbing your injuries on the marble of your mind is not a way to reflect on your past mistakes. Writing articles should be exposed to the fullest, that's right, but after exposing other people's, you should also expose yourself in turn. Don't just write your own advantages in the sand, then it is equivalent to a filial son's eulogy, which makes people abandon the scroll halfway, which is a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Even writing the benefits on marble is useless. Once an atomic bomb comes, won't the marble turn into powder? Being able to write your own benefits in people's hearts is what is truly brilliant and never fades. However, writing in people's hearts requires some skill and artistry, which depends on how you write.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Pyramids of North America <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Jun</p>
<p>If I say that the pyramids are in North America, then many people will be surprised, and perhaps many people will say that what I say is wrong. Indeed, the saying that the pyramids are near Egypt in Africa is undeniable, and everyone also knows that King Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt built a huge pyramid. But from Mexico in North America to the southern border of Canada, there are more pyramids, and one is one and a half times larger than the pyramid of Cheops, although the height is not as high.</p>
<p>The Cholula Pyramid in the state of Puebla, Mexico, is larger in volume than any other in the world, even one hundred and fifty percent larger than the Pyramid of Cheops in Giza near Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The Cahokia Pyramid outside East St. Louis in Illinois also occupies a very wide area.</p>
<p>These newly discovered pyramids in North America are called New Pyramids. They were originally built of earth or rubble by Indians. Because the highlands of Mexico and the deserts of the Andes lacked stone, mud bricks were widely used instead.</p>
<p>The basic difference between the New Pyramids and the Egyptian pyramids is due to their different functions. The Egyptian pyramids are all mausoleums, while the New Pyramids are all temple sites. Therefore, the New Pyramids are flat-topped and not like the angled pointed tops of the Egyptian pyramids. The New Pyramids are surrounded by several conical tombs, which, like the Egyptian mausoleums, have long attracted the attention of general explorers. There are various valuable pottery, shells, pearls and gems... etc. in the tomb.</p>
<p>Indians are not as capable as Egyptians in inventing methods to preserve corpses into mummies. The custom of their tribes is to cut off the flesh from the corpses and only place the bones in the tomb. Therefore, archaeologists find it difficult to study the builders of these pyramids.</p>
<p>North of Mexico, these primitive pyramids are arranged near the Mississippi River and its tributaries.</p>
<p>The Cahokia Pyramid has an area of more than sixteen acres. Its volume is a total of 21,690,000 cubic feet. Its length is 721 feet on the south side and 998 feet on the north side. Its height is 99 feet, and it is called the "king" of the New Pyramids. Archaeologists say that this New Pyramid was built around 500 AD.</p>

<p>— Guo Ping</p>
<p>If you want to choose a few good friends, what a difficult thing it is! Many friends talk about benevolence and morality, but when you turn around, he will say slander, slander, and insult you behind your back. There are many so-called "wine and meat friends". Today you treat him to eat and drink something, he will say you are a good friend, and he can be so close that he can "commit suicide for you", but when your purse is empty tomorrow, he will sneak away. If you want to raise some money from him, he will deny that you are his friend. There are many friends who can only share hardships but not wealth. The eight years of the War of Resistance and the nearly three years of victory are an excellent example. In the storms of hardship, everyone "worked together in harmony", and everyone helped, loved, and sympathized with each other, but when the situation improved, they had to "fight for power and profit" and "intrigue" and could not blend into one. There are also many friends who can only share wealth but not adversity. In prosperous days, everyone is a friend, but when disaster strikes, when you ask your friend for a helping hand, he no longer pays attention to you, and everyone "goes their separate ways" and disperses.</p>
<p>However, books are not like this. They have no class concept, they have no time and space, and they have no hypocrisy and deception. They tell us all the knowledge of the world, the purpose and essence of life, and the existence of truth, goodness, and beauty. They will tell a poor person all the sins and troubles of the rich, and they will also scold and expose the crimes of the rich in front of a rich man without concealment. They will tell a miserable child the secrets of success, and they will also warn a rich young master that he will one day lose his family and his reputation in a life of luxury. You can take it to the North and South Poles or the equator, and it will never complain about the extreme heat and cold; you can take it to a thatched cottage, or you can take it to a prosperous city, and it will not despise your poverty. It can accompany you, comfort you, and guide you throughout your life. Choosing a confidant is the most difficult thing, because as the saying goes, "It is easy to know a man's face, but not his heart." Choosing a good book is very easy, as long as you are willing to choose it, it is as easy as turning your hand.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Also on Criticism <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>A few days ago, I talked about Mr. Dai Youxu's article "On Criticism." After carefully savoring it again and again, I felt that I had a lot to say, so I rashly wrote down some opinions.</p>
<p>As Mr. Xuren said: "Who is without fault? If a person does not have a single mistake in decades, he must have been deified since birth." The saying "Even a saint has three points of fault" means this. However, although mistakes are unavoidable by anyone, it is not possible to forgive mistakes because they are unavoidable, or even to think that there is no such thing as mistakes in the world, which would be a big mistake. How can mankind progress? I think it must be due to the ability to constantly correct mistakes. Confucius said, "Do not be afraid to correct your mistakes" and "Do not make the same mistake twice." If you have mistakes and can improve, mistakes will become the driving force for progress. If you know your mistakes but do not correct them, that is an unforgivable sin.</p>
<p>The authorities are confused, and the bystanders are clear. It is always more difficult for oneself to see one's own mistakes, which may be the origin of criticism. Although everyone has faults, it does not mean that having faults disqualifies them from criticism, because criticism is about the right and wrong of things. Even if "in fact it is slandering one's own shadow," there is nothing wrong with it. In this way, mutually learning from each other and pointing out each other's faults, and both parties can thoroughly examine and humbly ask for advice, mistakes can be gradually reduced.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should make more benevolent criticisms of each other and establish a climate of criticism. Moreover, in a democratic country now, freedom of criticism is highly valued. The more truth is wiped, the brighter it becomes. Let everyone state their opinions and let everyone point out each other's mistakes. Only in this way can we gather the will of the people to do things, which will easily achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>How should the standpoint of criticism be? Of course, it cannot be purely based on a personal point of view, so as to avoid easily falling into subjectivity. But it is not necessary to "take the other party's standpoint as the standpoint," because if you take the other party's standpoint, you will similarly fall into subjectivity. For example, today there is corruption in the officialdom. If we think from the standpoint of the corruptors, then we will come to the wrong conclusion that "Everyone is corrupt, why am I clean?" or "The reason why officials are corrupt is because they haven't made enough money." We should discuss things on their own merits, abandon private prejudices that vary from person to person, not condone what is wrong, and criticize what should be criticized. If the criticism is wrong, then we have the courage to accept the criticism. We know that the critic does not necessarily have to be more talented than the person being criticized, as long as he has the ability to distinguish right from wrong. For example, when we eat, we complain that the chef has made the soup too salty and the vegetables too bland. Although we cannot cook, we can taste it. There is absolutely no way that the chef would put down the kitchen knife and the pot and tell us to try it. Otherwise, there would be no such thing as critics in the world. The newspaper says that the government needs to improve something, and the executive will call the editor to the stage to do it; a literary theorist says that the theme of a novel is bad, and the novelist will call the theorist to write a novel to see, there is certainly no such thing in the world.</p>

<p>Chapter 13 Striving to Remedy (106)</p>
<p>Qi Wan said, unable to help feeling sad, and said: "The next day, without waiting for him to speak, I opened the jewelry box, took out two diamond rings, handed them to him, and told him that you have a wide range of social contacts, take these things out, just to show your intention. In other words, it is not needed, you might as well take it away. He knew what I meant, he was unwilling to lend the things to him, he just smiled, put the two rings on his fingers, and said to me: You are right, it is not needed, I will find a friend now, and I will return the things to you in a while. As soon as he left, I also went out to buy a boat ticket, and rushed to Shanghai." Qi Wan finished speaking, and cried sadly again. Liu Ru listened to these words, sighed and said: "It's good to be back, you don't have to be sad, your future is very bright, as long as you are willing to work hard, there is a lot of promise, what I am most worried about is, you have been gone for so many days, why didn't you give me a letter?" Qi Wan said: "As soon as I arrived in Hong Kong, I sent you a telegram, didn't you receive it? It must be that Dao Yun is making trouble in the middle!" Liu Ru said: "This kid, when he comes back one day, I will settle accounts with him! Now that you are back, I plan to send a telegram to Peiping and send all your outfits here. You will definitely be very popular if you do dance hall work again." It is said that since Qi Wan arrived at the hospital, Zhu Su visited her, but could not get any news even by writing letters. Later, he went to Qi Wan's house to inquire several times, and waited until Qi Wan left before Aunt Wang secretly told him that the young boss had left Peiping. Zhu Qi was very disappointed when he heard this. He felt that this time, for the sake of Qi Wan alone, he had caused discord in the family, divorced his wife, and even become estranged from Yun Qing. Now that Qi Wan has left, to make up for this regret, he must associate with Zhang Yunxiang. Being able to repair their former friendship and re-establish a good relationship can still make up for these boring years. Zhu Zhai thought about it all night in the dormitory. He felt that Yun Qing was a person who was cold on the outside but warm on the inside, and very attentive. This time, she worked very hard to help him divorce Feng Sheng. It was a pity that he was so obsessed with Qi Wan at the time that he was too indifferent to her. She is a careful person, and if she is found out, it will be difficult to deal with. He also thought that she was infatuated with me, so this small episode doesn't matter. Now that Qi Wan has left, she may not be able to know clearly about my relationship with Qi Wan, so there is no need to be timid, but to try to find out. Zhu Zhai's heart was not as hesitant as it was towards Yunxiang, and he could not help but hurried to Zhang's residence. When he came upstairs, he saw Yun Qing alone in the room, sitting at the desk weaving hand lines. Under the glass panel on the desk was still the half-length photo of Zhu Qi. Zhu Zhai saw this situation and thought to himself that her heart has not changed. He patted her shoulder lightly and said: "The old lady has gone to Tianjin again?" Yun Qing leaned her body slightly to one side, nodded, and did not answer. Zhu Zhai sat opposite her desk, looking at her face without makeup, slightly yellow, and rather haggard, and said: "You have lost weight!"</p>
<h3 id="e199">Newly Ascending Lingyin Cave <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Among the caves in the southeast, the most famous ones are the Shuanglong Binghu in Jinhua and the Shanjuan Gengsang in Yixing. The ingenious arrangement of nature has its own strangeness, but it is also because of the convenient transportation and easy access by wheels. If it is a remote and secluded place, protected by misty peaks, and the sound is isolated, even if there are immortal caves and divine doors, the hermits will not be able to explore its secrets. Lingyin Cave is located in Longmen Town, which belongs to Xindeng County, about forty-five miles away from the city, and is the hometown of the late poet Luo Yin. In this place, calves do not hit their noses and mosquitoes do not bite people. Folk mythology is still prevalent. The cave is high and chokes the mountainside, and its huge mouth swallows the sky. It is connected in seven places. Its width, depth, strangeness and danger are ten or a hundred times greater than those of the North Mountain Yangxian. However, since ancient times, few tourists have made inscriptions. Therefore, its reputation is not known and it has been closed off for a long time. In September of the thirty-first year, I followed the Fourth Comfort Group of the War Zone to visit the counties along the Yangtze River, and explored the area along the way. I was surprised to find it was a spectacular sight, and wrote a long song to praise it. Now I hear that the Fuyang Highway has been connected to Xindeng, so I describe its beauty to tell those who seek novelty.</p>
<p>What divine hand carved chaos? In what year did the stone break open its mysteries? A secret ancient new city is hidden. The mountain spirit roars angrily every night. In the deep autumn, I sought the strange and pointed to Longmen. The frost grass and sand were daring for a hundred miles. Only when the sun set, the stone was green, and my short hair went through the pine trees and came out steeply. It was surprising to float with the clouds, and the old vines gnawed at my hat even more angrily. There were hundreds of dangerous steps, climbing to the depths of the mountain. A broken temple blocked it in front, and the fallen leaves could not be swept away. Sweat poured into the moss, strengthening the sound of the stream. Lingyun Mountain was a thief and robbed my mountain. Looking up and striving with courage, I experienced the desolation and yin and yang reversed. Outside the cave, the village was full of red. Inside the cave, step by step, I was covered in痴雾. It was two hundred feet high and five feet wide. My head was thrown into the half-sky kiln. Woodcutters cut bamboo for torches, and shouted to illuminate the two walls first. The engraved words were vaguely recognized, and the first guest arrived in the early years of Daoguang. Then I knew that this cave had been desolate for hundreds of millions of years, and the Taoist records, Dan books, maps and local chronicles had suddenly leaked without a name. Stroking it, I shouted and startled the white bats, whose wings drummed like wheels to lead the way. Rising to the sky was even more like entering the earth. I turned left and right and only cried madly! The weapons of war were originally close at hand. This place was a world of its own. The flowing water under my feet was noisy with Guangyue. The stalactites above my head were as big as spring bamboo shoots. Ten thousand kinds of flying creatures could be recruited. The red, white, blue, and yellow were all different paintings. Suddenly, the emptiness answered Hongdi. Suddenly, it was as narrow and folded as a waistband. Sometimes the sand was as wide as a desert, and sometimes the green was burned from ghosts and monsters. The wings of the immortal birds accumulated rain on their shoulders. The deeper I went, the more I felt it was narrow! I only saw the郁瘴 steaming with wind and thunder. The guide shook his hand and the followers warned: If I die in the wilderness, who will worship me for not dying for the country? Moreover, there are seven caves in the cave. Circling up and down, groping and bending over, this is still a shallow taste of one-tenth. When it is dangerous and narrow like a bowl mouth, how can you enter the hole if your body is not a snake? When it is bright and leaks skylight, if you spin the urn like an ant or throw the well like a frog, how can you lead it out with your eyes confused and your heart confused? I want to bravely explore its secrets, but I am afraid that the torches will be extinguished and my clothes will freeze. One step, one look, one regret. I left the cave with frost white and crows scattered. Who is better off igniting a huge explosion, cracking the cliffs, and the sounds of stars and moons flying? Alas! There are thirty-six Langhuan Lingfu, and the ghosts and axes are arranged to be sent sometimes. Old explorations of Shanjuan Gengsang often click their tongues. Shuanglong Binghu is promoted as a wonder in the southeast. Now I see this and feel that the other is insignificant. Alas! The mountains and rivers show the world by means of human culture. How could Zhaojian not see or hear it at that time? Xia Ke is falsely called a good traveler, and he should be angry underground! Laugh at him for being a pedantic scholar who wastes paper and ink and cannot spread out of Xindengmen. Supervise me to write a long song to describe the thirty-seven cave heavens, and no one is like He Yongxin to promote the secluded! After singing, I threw the pen and looked east, thinking of the Hu horses drinking ice waterfalls, and my tears stained my scarf, wanting to wet the clouds of Jinhua.</p>
<h3 id="e200">A Discourse on Inflation in Antiquity <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— A Man of Importance</p>
<p>Recently, prices have skyrocketed, and paper money is worthless. Take the sesame seed cake as an example: ten years ago, each one cost one cent, but now a ten-thousand-yuan note can only buy two cakes. In other words, using the sesame seed cake as a standard, a ten-thousand-yuan note is only worth two cents compared to ten years ago.</p>
<p>However, so-called inflation is not only seen in modern China and Europe but has existed in China since ancient times.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese currency, the oldest forms were furs and shells, followed by pearls, jade, gold, knives, and silk, and then copper and iron coins. As for banknotes, they only appeared in the Song Dynasty. At that time, the Song Dynasty used paper to replace copper coins due to an empty treasury. These banknotes were called "Great Song Circulating Treasure Notes." This was the beginning of paper money in China. After the Qingli era, the people of Shu (Sichuan) received official permission to issue paper money with a fixed redemption period, called "Jiaozi." This type of Jiaozi was equivalent to modern drafts. Later, due to insufficient credit, their value plummeted, marking the beginning of inflation in our country.</p>
<p>The Song Dynasty was destroyed, and the Yuan people ruled China. Although there were silver ingots (Yuanbao) at that time, they also issued treasure notes, with the amount of money printed on the face of the notes, along with the words "Gu Zu Dui" (fully redeemable in the treasury). However, later, due to excessive issuance, the "Gu Zu Dui" eventually became non-redeemable.</p>
<p>Ming Taizu (the Hongwu Emperor) destroyed the Yuan Dynasty and established his capital in Jinling (Nanjing). He also issued paper money, called "Great Ming Circulating Treasure Notes." At that time, each string (guan) was worth two qian and five fen of gold. In the twenty-second year of Hongwu, a small denomination of treasure notes was issued, the smallest being worth only ten wen. However, learning from past mistakes and fearing a recurrence of inflation, the Ming Dynasty established strict laws. Nevertheless, the situation of high prices and worthless currency could not be avoided. Later, due to wars in the border provinces, the value of the banknotes plummeted. Consequently, the Xuande Emperor banned the use of silver. A law was established stating that anyone using one fen of silver would be fined one thousand guan of cash. During the Yingzong era, the previous order was reiterated: anyone who dared to refuse to accept treasure notes would be fined ten thousand guan and their entire family exiled to the frontier. However, such strict laws could not stand against reality. As a result, by the time of the Xianzong Emperor, each string was only worth one qian, almost equivalent to waste paper.</p>
<p>When the Qing Dynasty came to power, they, mindful of the chaotic currency system of the Ming Dynasty, decided to abolish paper money and established a bureau to exclusively mint coins. In the second year of Xianfeng, due to urgent military needs, they issued silver notes and cash notes. Official silver and money shops were also established as redemption agencies. However, excessive issuance by various provinces led to great abuses. Therefore, regulations for money and cash notes were formulated. However, after the Tongzhi era, the credibility of cash notes declined again. With the influx of foreign silver dollars into the country, silver dollars were imitated to maintain the credit of the currency.</p>
<p>During the Republic of China, many banknotes were issued by official and commercial banks. We will not discuss the issue of counterfeit notes. However, in the third year of the Republic, due to political problems, the banknotes of the Bank of Communications could only be redeemed at a discount. This was because hard currency was circulating, and various Chinese and foreign banks had their own banknotes. Therefore, the issue with the Bank of Communications notes did not significantly affect inflation at the time.</p>
<p>I am not an economic expert, so I can only describe historical events and hope that knowledgeable people will refer to them and come up with better solutions!</p>
<h3 id="e201">How Much Heat Can the Human Body Endure? <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>In hot weather, people sweat profusely, but how much heat can the human body actually tolerate? If a person is placed in an oven hot enough to cook an egg, what would be the consequences?</p>
<p>This question is especially important in today's world of aviation development. If a condenser fails suddenly in a jet plane flying at six hundred miles per hour, the compression and friction of the air will create an uncomfortable heat inside the cabin, possibly turning it into an oven. Therefore, the air force must know how much heat a crew member can endure, and for how long, without suffering burns to the skin or damage to internal organs.</p>
<p>To find this answer, Dr. Taylor, a professor at the University of California in Los Angeles, conducted an interesting experiment: he locked himself in a specially made "heat box" and heated it up. He placed a metal plate in front of his seat with an egg on it. He heated the box to 220 degrees Fahrenheit, and the egg cooked automatically. Yet, Taylor sat there for as long as twenty-five minutes. Although sweat flowed profusely, there were no other significant reactions except for an accelerated heartbeat (increasing from 82 to 162 beats per minute). Of course, after such an energy-consuming experiment, like a vigorous athletic competition, fatigue was inevitable, and some weight loss was also certain.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Taylor's report, the highest temperature the human body can tolerate is 262 degrees Fahrenheit. Under normal circumstances, water would already be boiling. However, the mystery of human physiology creates this strange phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sinicized Western Names <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>There are many examples of Western names translated into Chinese names. If we talk about elegance, solemnity, profound meaning, and historical reference, then the most outstanding example is "司徒合登" (Sītú Hédēng), the current U.S. Ambassador to China.</p>
<p>The Ambassador's original name is John Leighton Stuart. If we transliterate the entire name phonetically, the surname Stuart could be translated as "Sītú Huá'ěrtuō" or "Sītú Āyuàn", and the first name John is commonly translated as "Yuēhàn" (although this transliteration is not very accurate, it has been used for a long time, such as St. John's College and Dr. Johnson). The other name, Leighton, would be "Léidēng". Altogether, that's eight or nine syllables, which is eight or nine characters. Abbreviation is, of course, necessary. (Editor's note: Mr. Ling Xiao is probably slightly mistaken here, as the Ambassador's surname is actually a compound surname, Leighton Stuart.) However, extracting two syllables (司徒) from the four or five syllables of the surname perfectly matches the existing Chinese compound surname. This is the first marvel. Traditionally, Western surnames are translated by taking only one character from the original surname and dividing it into two or three Chinese characters to conform to the Chinese naming convention. For example, Churchill is originally just one surname, but the complete phonetic translation cannot be fully expressed by a single Chinese character (one syllable). If the Chinese surname is one character and one syllable, then Churchill would seem to be surnamed "邱" (Qiū), and named "古尔" (Gǔ'ěr), while the name Winston and other words can be completely disregarded. Similarly, Roosevelt is a surname, not a given name. However, once it becomes a Chinese name, it has a three-character name with a surname and a given name, and the original Western name Franklin, etc., is unnecessary. The three characters "华莱士" (Huáláisì) are sufficient for a name format, so Wallace can be retained, and Henry can be omitted. "史太林" (Shǐtàilín) is enough for a name format of surname "史" (Shǐ) and given name "太林" (Tàilín), so the name Josef, etc., can be removed. This is how most Western names are translated into Chinese; there are countless examples, and they can be seen everywhere. However, "司徒雷登" (Sītú Léidēng) is different.</p>
<p>According to the above and common translation methods, only the surname Stuart would be used, which would be "司徒华脱" (Sītú Huátuō), having both a surname and a given name. The Ambassador broke the convention and showed unique ingenuity, taking only half of the character Stuart for "司徒" (Sītú), and taking only one of the two given names for "雷登" (Léidēng). Combining them into a compound surname "司徒" (Sītú) with a given name "雷登" (Léidēng) is grand and well-proportioned, with both form and sound being beautiful. This is another marvel. There were many compound surnames in ancient China, such as Sima Yi, Sima Hui, Zhuge Liang, and Xiahou Yuan in the Three Kingdoms period, and Ouyang Xun in the Tang Dynasty, and Ouyang Xiu in the Song Dynasty, all of which are well-known. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties and today, single surnames are more common, and compound surnames are less common. The surname "司徒" (Sītú) can occasionally be seen. When I was at Peking University, there were still two "司徒" (Sītú) classmates, both from Guangdong. Currently, among the famous people with compound surnames in North China, the most prominent is Shangguan Yunxiang (one of the deputy commanders of the bandit suppression campaign). The characters "司徒雷登" (Sītú Léidēng) and "上官云相" (Shàngguān Yúnxiàng) are perfectly matched in terms of character pairing, harmonious in tone, and equal in status (one is a Chinese general, and the other is the North American ambassador). It's truly a beautiful story of "a fortunate encounter." The two gentlemen may not have foreseen this when they were naming themselves. This is yet another marvel. (American celebrities such as General Wedemeyer, Senator Zhou Yide, and Ambassador Pulitizer all have very good Chinese names.)</p>
<p>The transliteration of the current British Prime Minister's name was originally "阿特利" (Ātèlì), but in the past year, it has been changed to "艾德礼" (Àidélǐ). It is said that the modification was proposed by the British side, which shows the Westerners' increasing understanding of the Chinese language and their strong appreciation for the taste of Chinese names. The first letter of this gentleman's original name is A, and its sound can be translated as "阿" (Ā) or "艾" (Ài). However, "艾德礼" (Àidélǐ) is more dignified (the surname "艾" (Ài) comes from the doctor Ai Kong in the Spring and Autumn period, and "德礼" (Délǐ) comes from the Four Books, "Lead them with virtue and regulate them with ritual").</p>
<p>The name of the current U.S. President "杜鲁门" (Dùlǔmén), was originally translated as "特鲁受" (Tèlǔshòu) two years ago. Phonetically speaking, the former translation is closer, because the first letter of the original name is T, which matches the sound of "特" (Tè). The second and third letters RU match the sound of "鲁" (Lǔ), and the fourth, fifth, and sixth letters Man match the sound of "曼" (Màn). Since "杜鲁门" (Dùlǔmén) is considered the standard. However, "杜鲁门" (Dùlǔmén) seems to share the same lineage with the Chinese poet saint Du Shaoling, and the even tone of the character "门" (mén) is also more composed and harmonious than the character "曼" (màn). The combination of T and RU sounds like the two syllables of "杜鲁" (Dùlǔ), which is also quite appropriate and natural. (Atlee and Truman both resemble the names of old banner people.)</p>
<p>Why do Western names only need to take the surname to be transformed into a Chinese surname and given name? Why do the surnames of the old banner people not appear, but are habitually used the first character of their given name as the surname? There are certain natural principles. Once this principle is understood, everything can be easily resolved. What is the principle? It is the Law of Meter, the pauses in human language are most natural and comfortable with two to three syllables, and should not be more than three or less than two. Although Western fonts are of varying lengths, if we take Syllable as the standard, we can discover the common ground between Chinese and Western languages.</p>
<p>Chinese is one character and one syllable, and the sound range of one measure (what Westerners call a foot) cannot be more than two or less than two. Therefore, Chinese names, whether they are two characters (such as Hu Shi, Sun Ke, the sounds are no less than two), or three characters (such as Pan Gongzhan, He Jingzhi, the sounds are no more than three), all conform to the natural principle of meter, so throughout thousands of years of history, compatriots from more than twenty provinces, hundreds of millions of Chinese people, all have names of this format. Is it possible that the ancients and modern people had a prior agreement? No. Is it that the laws of the past dynasties stipulated this? Also, no. In a word, they are all unconsciously governed by the laws of nature.</p>
<p>When translating Western names, only the surname is used as the surname and given name, so the original name is not used. The Chinese names of the banner people use their given name as the surname and given name, and the original surname is not used. The two are exactly the opposite but have the same effect, which is a matter of great research interest. Now let me give an example: The pseudo-Manchukuo Emperor "溥仪" (Pǔyí) has two characters as his given name, and his surname is "爱辛觉罗" (Àixīnjuéluó). According to the rules, it should be said that his surname is "爱辛觉罗" (Àixīnjuéluó), his given name is "溥仪" (Pǔyí), and his courtesy name is "浩然" (Hàorán). However, the surname has so many characters that it is too cumbersome. Therefore, when he was in Tianjin and made a donation in the newspaper, he only said "溥浩然" (Pǔ Hàorán), which means his surname is "溥" (Pǔ), his given name is "仪" (Yí), and his courtesy name is "浩然" (Hàorán). How neat! His surname (a long surname with four translated characters) is not mentioned. Hongdouguan Master Pu Dong, a Kunqu opera performer, is also only referred to as Pu Houqi. He is good at playing Zhou Yu, and the name reported on the stage is always "Surname Zhou, given name Yu, courtesy name Gongjin," so if Hongdouguan Master is to be added to the opera's cast list, it would just be "Surname Pu, given name Dong, courtesy name Houqi," and it would never be "Surname Aixinjueluo, given name Pu Dong, courtesy name Houqi." Another example is the Governor-General of Liangjiang at the end of the Qing Guangxu period, "端方" (Duānfāng), who was known as "Marshal Duanwu." His notices and official documents also marked his surname as "端" (Duān). In fact, his surname was "托活络" (Tuōhuólúo), which is also a useless, cumbersome transliteration. Therefore, his given name "端方" (Duānfāng) was used, taking one character "端" (Duān) as the surname, and the other character "方" (Fāng) as the given name. His courtesy name was "午桥" (Wǔqiáo). (Duan also had the courtesy name Taoqi, which is said to be of Han ancestry Tao clan. This is another system, which is too expensive to investigate, so I will not discuss it now.)</p>
<p>People want a surname but no given name, and the banner people want a given name but no surname. Westerners' surnames can be successfully transformed into Chinese names, and the banner people's given names can also be successfully transformed into Chinese names. They reach the same destination through different routes. It can be seen that the Chinese name is a model of ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. The reason why it can become a formula for names is by no means accidental. The reason is that it conforms to the natural rhythm of human speech.</p>

We Hope Poor Pregnant Women Will Apply Early and Warm-Hearted Readers Will Generously Donate. <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The poor women's assisted childbirth campaign, sponsored by this newspaper, helped a total of thirty-six poor pregnant women in February. Among them, nineteen were delivered at Renhe Hospital, totaling 29 million yuan; eleven were delivered at Shangxian Hospital, totaling 30.538 million yuan; four were delivered at Baoli Hospital, totaling 6.515 million yuan; and two were delivered at the Red Cross Hospital, totaling 3.752 million yuan. The total delivery cost of the four hospitals was 69.805 million yuan. According to the contract, this newspaper should bear half of the delivery cost of each cooperating hospital, which is 34.9025 million yuan, an increase of slightly less than 50% compared to January.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinhua Feng still maintains his past generosity and has independently donated this huge sum of money. Due to currency fluctuations and the continuous rise in living standards, we can predict that the future of the "Poor Women's Assisted Childbirth" campaign will be quite difficult and challenging. However, we do not want to see countless poor pregnant women suffer from economic pressure and the ravages of disease. We can only make an urgent appeal to warm-hearted readers in the newspaper. We hope everyone can generously donate and not increase the burden on Mr. Jin alone, so that this campaign can continue forever and benefit poor pregnant women.</p>

<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>If you pursue money, people will say you are greedy. If you hide your money, people will say you are a miser. If you spend your money, people will say you are a prodigal. If you can't get money, people will say you are a useless piece of junk. If you don't want to get money, people will say you have no ambition. If you get money without working, people will say you are a parasite relying on others. If you work hard all your life and get money, people will say you have been a horse or cow all your life and simply don't know how to enjoy life. (Translated from "Ao Guan")</p>
