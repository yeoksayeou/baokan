<p>（二）士兵餉項。副秣費及公雜費用的合理調整。目前部隊士氣低落，軍紀不良，主因將士不得溫飽；又以公雜費用不敷，致部隊多以缺空彌補，影響戰力非小。爲應事實需要，且在不過分增加國庫負担原則下，經擬定調整辦法。關於士兵餉項副秣費及公雜費，均可得一合理調整。</p>
<p>何末並報告最近各戰場戰况甚祥。</p>

<h3>報人的責任</h3>
<p>最近立法院數次討論軍事外交及金融財政的秘密，因被京滬若千報紙局部的或全部的洩灑，不僅會引起立法院的軒然大波，而且在輿論界也引起了「新聞自由」有無範圍的爭議。我們站在報人的立塲，對於這個有關本身的問題，自然格外感覺到興趣。</p>
<p>從報紙的內容看來，有報道消息的新聞，有引導與論的評論，有輔助商品交換的廣吿，以及有滿足讀者知識欲望的專欄文字，其與社會生活的關係，實在太密切了。美國第三任總統傑佛生說：「報紙是啓發民智的最好工具，帮助人民理解事情而成為社會的一個完善份子。威爾遜總統也說：「報紙是國民的精神食糧。」美國新聞教育專家威廉博士甚至把報紙視為促進現代文明進步的三大力量之一。我國學者專家對於報紙對於社會的功效，亦莫不張調其責任重大。梁任公論報紙的責任稱：報館者，政本之本，教師之師也。」一代報人張季雙氏對報紙之性質也說：「一面應作商業經營，一面則對於國家社會負有積極的扶助倡導之責任。」</p>
<p>我國報業在形式上雖較歐美爲落後，但在抗戰八年期間，却的確能盡報紙對於國家社會應盡之責任。不論是民間報紙也好，或是黨營報紙也好，都能在一個「民族至上國家至上」共同的信念之下，盡其宣揚國策「抗戰必勝」的能事。我國報人八年來致力於文章報國的結果，不僅深得國人的信賴與尊重，而且也獲得國際上的榮譽。但抗戰勝利以後，我國報業卻面臨兩大危機：一爲外來的危機，因爲國內的戰亂不已，社會不安，民生凋敝，物價高漲，使全國各地的報紙在物質條件上，無不感到貧乏的恐慌，甚至已有許多報紙，因無法生存而自動停刋了。二爲內在的危機，因爲我國報人，受了國際潮流的激盪，無不醉心於「新聞自由」，而同時却每每忽略了「新聞的責任」。因爲在一部分報人看來，滿以爲新聞自由無異可讓我們新聞記者，衝破藩籬，隨心所欲，因此不論在新聞報道方面或在言論方面，不免越出常規，甚至拋棄國家民族的立塲於不顧。三年來報界的糾紛層出不窮，將來報界的問題恐仍將方興未艾，也未始不是這一點內在危機所釀成。</p>
<p>其實新聞自由，並沒有不可理解的奧妙理論。從它開始發動說，是在第二次大戰期間，各國有識之士，認爲戰後如欲締迭世界和平，且希望其能維持久遠，則必須謀得國際新聞的自由，一方面可以促進各國人民的諒解和合作，另一方而使過去那種秘密外交的方式不致重演於來日；同時又認爲若欲保持各國政治的民主制度，則又非取得國內言論自由不可。沒有批評，卽無民主可言。從理論上說，這個新聞自由運動，實爲世界報業的一大革新運動。但是何謂新聞自由？因爲時間的短促，一直沒有加以確切的說明。因此，被一些人濫用，在新聞自由的烟幕下，不知不覺間造了多少罪孽。今年三四月間，國際新聞自由會議在日內瓦舉行，對於新聞自由通過許多決議，其中最重要的一項，就是關於新聞自由有無範圍的問題，已經成功湖聯合國人權委員會採納，訂立爲新聞自由的條款。它規定每一個人有思想和言論的自由，這些自由均屬於人權的一部份，不應受政府的干涉，但是又規定新聞自由必須有其責任與議務，不能逾越下列八項的限制，否則卽應受法律的制裁。這八項限制是：（一）有關國家安全利益必須保守機密的事項；（二）煽動人民以暴力推翻政府組織的言論；（三）煽動人民犯罪的言論（四）敗壞風化的言論；（五）破壞司法公平審判的言論；（六）侵犯著作權或版權；（七）誹謗他人聲譽的言論；（八）中傷國與國，或人與人之友誼的虛僞或歪曲事實的有系統的報道。</p>
<p>這個新聞自由的條款，當爲全世界爭取人權，愛好自由，維護民主的人士一致所能接受。在這裏，我們不僅能明瞭新聞自由的眞諦，而且我們也可相信，我國現行出版法雖有修改的必要，但在原則上仍有若干保持的價値。例如第四章出版品登載事項的限制，除了第二十一條第一項中「意圖破壞中國國民黨」字樣或不適用於行憲的今日而外，其餘條款大體均可適用。聞政府當局亦將修正此一條款。但最近有人主張廢止這個出版法，若不是「別有用心」，則在理論上就不免曲解新聞自由了。</p>
<p>要之，古人所謂「一言興邦，一言喪邦」，現在何嘗不是如此？記者的一枝筆，不但有關於當前國家的榮辱，世界的安危；而且其影響所及，人類的運命亦繫於報人之手。我們回憶我國報人在抗戰期間所以能盡報人應盡的職責除了有一個共同的信念「民族至上，國家至上」而外，國民參政會曾制訂一個戰時新聞政策，以抗戰建國綱領爲標準，確定了新聞報道五項原則，使全國的報人，不論撰述評論或是報道新聞，均有一個共同遵守的規則，故能達到「意志集中力量集中」的目的。現在尚在戡亂建國期間，萬方多難，更有賴我們報人的努力，在新聞自由與新聞責任同時並重的範圍內，盡我報人對於國家社會的責任。本報同人願與全國同業共勉之！</p>
<h3>偉大建設惜被忽視海南電　海南電廠處危境　規模僅次於小豐滿及日月潭　困處匪區亟盼政府速謀救濟</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十二日電〕記者今爲國人報道一爲人忽視之偉大建設，此建設關係我國經濟與國防均至深且鉅，然目前則被棄如敝屣，良可慨嘆。此建般爲何？卽粤省海南電廠是。該廠規模在我國除東北之小豐滿，台灣之日月潭外，各省水力發電，殆無出其右者。廿九年日人佔領海南後，以島上不產燃煤及石汕，工業動力除水力發電外，殆無別法，遂創立東方水力發電廠，三十四年日人投降，由資委會辦理，改稱海南電廠。該廠位於樂東縣東方墟新北大江南岸，江流至此忽成一大灣曲，河岸陡峭，高數十公尺，日人利用地勢，於瀑布上游築堤鑿渠，引水發電，其欄水壩長四二七，六五公尺，高四公尺半，引水渠爲梯形明渠，深三公尺，闊六公尺，長一，一七〇，七七公尺，最大容量爲每秒廿六立方公尺，水槽有效容量爲三，零零零立方公尺，水管係將水槽內之水導入發電廠，引動發電機，管爲軟鋼電桿，內徑二，一公尺，長六二，二四公尺，至電機設備，有七千瓩立軸單輸單流反動式水力機一座，又七千（KWA）一萬一千伏八十週波三相同期交流發電機一座，與水力機直接相聯，該廠發出電壓爲一萬一千伏，經變壓器後，升高爲六萬六千伏，送入輸電綫，由廠直至會水地方，再分爲西南兩路，一路經石碌礦山，一路至北黎八所港，全長八十公里。該廠有變電所二處，一位於白沙縣石碌礦塲，有變壓器四具，每具容量爲一千（KWA），一位於感恩縣八所港，有變壓器四具，每具容量爲六千（KWA）。按照日人設備及計劃，該廠所發電量，除可供礦山農田及各工廠用電外，以之供給全島照明，亦有餘裕。惟至接收後，匪共肆虐，接收員工及工程師死難者多人，長達八十公里之輸電綫路，時遭破壞，至去年九月，該項輸電綫已遭破壞無餘。該廠電機雖依舊晝夜發電，但已無法輸至北黎等地，現該廠已困處匪區核心，四境被圍，自停電後，不獨一切設備及各種物資器材不能他運，卽員（工出入，亦不可能，薪津給養隔半月恃北黎大隊駐軍押解一次，當局苟不急行設法，該廠恐將不保。刻資委會已決定結束此電化海南之原動力，如果實現，則現在所官傳之「開發海南島」簡直是欺人之談，再過數年，恐海南島又將退化如抗戰前之一片荒蕪狀態矣。</p>

<h3>武裝「間諜恐怖團體」　潛入南境全落綱　中共響應共產情報局譴責狄托</h3>
<p>〔聯合社貝爾格勒十一日電〕內政部今日宣稱，政府緝拿已久之第一號戰犯，即法西斯黨魁貝夫里契，去年在國外從事反狄托運動甚甚力，旣派武裝「間諜恐怖團」十九個，共計九十五人潛入南斯拉夫，但經警察偵悉，逐一捕獲，貝氏助手卡夫蘭亦在其內。</p>

<h3>各界領袖分析物價漲因　潘議長表示應有統盤管制計劃　主張設全國性機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近幾月來一連串熾烈漲風，幾使大家透不過氣來。近幾週來物價，天天演着三級跳，實在驚心動魄，弄得大家惶惶不可終日。究竟，此種通貨物價惡性循環，是否尙能設法遏制，物價波灡，是否還可平抑，記者特普遍訪問本市各界首長和各業領袖，把各人之意見歸納在下面，希望能對當前物價狂瀾，能有一確切而有效之診斷。</p>
<p>市參議會潘議長分析目前物價高漲原因有三：（一）通貨膨脹已爲無可諱言之事實，惟如以戰前爲標準，通貨發行數字之增加仍未超過物價之上漲率，故所謂通貨膨脹眞正意義，乃在通貨行使區域縮小，流轉速度加快，因而造成高漲。（二）一般利息增高，亦與物價跳動互爲因果，工商界因受高利影響而致成本加重，最後乃不得不將出品價格提高。（三）生活指數逐月調整，亦足使物價與之前後呼應，互爲循環。潘氏認爲物價問題乃整個經濟問題之一環，中央亟應設一全國性總機構負責管理，而不能僅任令地方政府單獨處置，因管理物價事宜，苟缺乏統盤計劃，而徒從枝節着手，非但不克收抑平之效，反足增加刺激，造成此起彼伏之惡果。渠復引證昨日檢査倉庫檢討會議之結果，說明此種辦法固可有助於物似之暫時抑平，但上海果對各倉庫嚴格檢査，則其他各地貨物根本不敢運來，如最近嘉善·嘉興·松江一帶食米，已有改道囤運無錫之訊，即將來本市存米，亦未嘗無倒流他埠可能，故檢査倉庫辦法表面似甚妥善，實際恐仍無裨於物價之安定。</p>
<p>潘議長認爲政府對抑平物價，亟需定一整個辦法，全面施行，否則限於局部，適足捉襟見肘。如一方面開放省匯，而一方面又禁携兩億以上現鈔入境。市政當局曾有檢査各行莊本票支票存根之說，但始終未見實行。熔售金條曾聞進行澈査，但亦未見公佈眞相。中央曾擬勘査無錫囤米情形，而絲毫未見動靜。參議會由開幕迄閉幕，米價跳動幾何？而始終未見各主管部門有何切實有效辦法。凡此皆足證政府對一切平抑物價之舉措，應先要有辦法，後謀取信人民，始能收上下合作之効。</p>
<h3>證劵交易所　無封閉必要</h3>
<p>潘氏末就最近謠傳政府將封閉證劵交易所之說，復加圍釋謂：政府此種措施，或認爲因游資充塞而採取之緊急手段，但游資過多，係因通貨發行增加後，由於治安交通等關係未能充分導入生產事業所致。渠認爲交易所買賣國家債劵及工商股票，實可爲生產事業間接吸收游資，股票流通市面，擠有游資者可引起投資興趣，從事生產者亦可藉此吸收游資，並無封閉必要。有人以爲經營交易所係屬投機性質，縱使此說正確，但此種投機亦遠較投機於日用品之操縱裨益民生多多。故現可斷言，交易所苟被封閉，則大量游資必轉而囤購日用必需品，物價之高漲，自更　意料中事。潘氏認爲一切應付物價之辦法，知易行難，行難而收拾局面更難，故推行之初，即須顧及該辦法之實際後果，方克有效。</p>
<p>懲治投機　應求澈底</p>
<p>徐副議長寄廎表示，目前抑平物價有效辦法，厥在以全力打擊不法商人，如最近當局即將實行之檢查倉庫，及懲治各業首要投機份子等工作，希望能做得澈底，尤希在執行手續上注意勿長擾正當工商業。渠認爲惟有如此，始能使善良商人起示範作用，而奸商亦知所歛跡。</p>
<p>應改革幣制　扶助工商業</p>
<p>六區棉紡公會常務理事劉靖基談稱：要解決物問題，政府應設法改革幣制，穩定幣値，同時，眞正設法扶助工商業，使游資自然流向生產途徑，否則，物價漫無止境的狂漲，非惟國計民生遭受災害，上海正當的工商業，都要宣吿破產。劉氏又謂：個人看法，要平抑物價，須從增加生產和物資着手。要平穩幣值，須從獎勵出口爭取外匯着手。</p>
<p>交易所業務　範圍應擴大</p>
<p>經紀人公會理事畏王乃徐認爲市面游資過多，沒有適當去處，爲物價上漲最大因素，而交易所却爲收納游資最理想的塲所，若要緩和物價漲勢，必須設法擴大交易所業務範圍。</p>
<p>產區米價　應先抑平</p>
<p>米商業常務理事瞿振華稱：米價局部限價，易使產區與銷區形成倒流，影響來源，似宜從產區抑平，庶幾求得根本解決，而疏導糧源，减低運費和成本，嚴禁投機，清查豪門囤積，亦均為治標之要圖。</p>
<h3>拋售政策值得檢討　保障一般貧民生活　應謀擴大配給種類</h3>
<p>立委奚玉書謂，物價問題爲全國性的問題，且相互關聯，應全面處理。戰前農民一担米可換兩疋布，現在龍頭細布已出四千萬，米價如照限價出售，一祖米只能換半疋布，農民之生計將成問題。以煤價而論，燃管會指出漲價之理中爲運輸成本高，但加價以後，遝輸成本勢必更高。此外如生活指數與物價，亦互爲因果，凡此可見一切經濟因素，均息息相關。今日之物價問題，事實上爲一幣値問題，此則與政府之發行有直接關係。五十天來，日用品及金鈔黑市已漲五倍，不顧社會利益之投機商固可惡，但主管機關亦迄今缺乏一穩定物價之通盤政策。目前中央銀行之規定利率及國庫券之利息，均接近三角，結匯證明書自實行以來，雖有央行之暗中拋出，上漲之倍數亦可觀，凡此均爲物價之指標。同時政府處理掌握之物資，政策亦値得檢討，目前之拋售政策，並不能使此類物資直接到達平民之手，而反使中間商乘機得利，今日米之配給制度已實施有成效，應設法擴大其種類，使物價雖有波動，而貧民生活尙可得最低保障。</p>
<h3>控制物價　必須掌握物資</h3>
<p>總工會理事長水祥雲稱：要穩定物價：第一，應是全國全面化的實施，單在上海一地施壓力是沒有用的。（一）應該用經濟辦法來解決經濟問題，政府本身必須掌握物資，從而配合政治軍事，才能控制物價。（二）如果物價問題中確有人爲因素，政府考慮「借人頭」「開刀」，則必須由上而下，殺幾隻「老虎」看看。此外，政府本身應應以身作則，公務員絕對不能做生意。</p>
<p>凍結發行　收縮通貨</p>
<p>工業協會總幹事田和鄭稱：現在的情形，大家對法幣沒有信心，一到手就立刻用出去，這樣增加通貨的週轉速率，愈促使物價的循環上漲，所以政府應該趕快收拾民心，第一應凍結發行，其次利用美援，拋售物資來收縮通貨。至於查倉庫借人頭都不是根本的辦法。</p>
<h3>潘士浩寄希望於美援</h3>
<p>複製業領袖潘士浩，主張證交恢復遞交，讓游資都到那邊去。又主張對軍需所去的鈔票，統計其回籠換取物資之速率和趨向，以覘物資供求的後景。潘氏復表示：美援快要到來，中原戰局也在好轉，如果公用事業和國營事業能忍耐一下，生活指數和貨品售價的循環刺激能和緩一下，物價的漲風，可以减低的。</p>
<h3>英商領袖意見</h3>
<p>英國商會理事長安諾德談稱：就一般而論，要把國內物價，控制在世界物價水準綫以下，個人認爲是得不到效果的。例如：以配給米價言，照黑市匯率推算，祗合到世界米價水準四分之一，卽以官價匯率而言，也祗合到世界米價水準的一半。忽略了這些事實，一切均屬徒然。配給制度是合理的，但糧食津貼制度並無用處，且將招致弊害，因爲政府無法平衡預算。同時，對甚至毋須結匯的消費品，也禁止輸入，必將迫使本市物價上漲。又外股交易亦不失爲游資合理的去路，但現在考慮欠週，對這種交易也加以禁絕，以致這部份的游資，轉移到商品上去，物價又焉得不漲。</p>
<h3>食米囤戶紛紛遷無錫　市長再電政院請澈查　糧食部已派員分赴鎭錫一帶查察</h3>

<h3>西片僵局解決　影院接受西商條件　新片即將次第公映</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市西片商停供新片糾紛，自各首輪影院於上週六再度調整票價爲五十萬，七十萬，九十萬三級後，業吿正式解決。西片商方面表示對上述票價並不絕對滿意，尤其對廿萬元之限價影票，仍堅決主張須以底數五角乘職員生活指數，隨時機動調整，如目前之限價卽應爲廿八萬元，惟此項要求已爲社會局拒絕考慮。故西片商重又向影院業提出聲明，苟遇有特殊優級新片，開映之影院須根據契約臨時提高售價，以補救限價票之虧蝕。如大華下期新片「水蓮公主」，最高票價可能在一百萬元以上。聞西片商提出之條件，影院業已全部接受，故本市影迷渴待已久之新西片，本週起卽將陸續上映。下期新片首先出現者，爲大光明國泰之「碧雲天一，南京美琪之「單刀赴會」。</p>

<h3>大學生控告親生父　請求共同生活　負擔敎育費用　昨日開審兩造均未到</h3>

<h3>全國獻納鉅額救濟特捐的第一人　陜西耆宿張翔初</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張僊洲</p>
<p>〔本報西安　日航訊〕張翔初先生在陜西，差不多是無人不知的，不論是大人小孩，凡提起這位老先生，都親切有緻，而且有些人在口頭上把他英雄化了。眞的，一個人的生活與事業，如果和大衆能連繫在一起，自然會受人們的尊敬。張先生主要的功績，是把陜西的淸廷地方政權推翻，影饗了武昌起義，把陝西從一個專制與昏庸的鎖鏈中解放出來。作爲一個革命領袖，作爲一個長者和一個紳士，他在這裏一直被人尊敬着。</p>
<p>半生奔波　晚年閒靜</p>
<p>近十數年來，大約是他厭倦了宦海生涯，半生奔波，一身勞累，於是息影家園，安靜的度着晚年歲月。有時也出來常做些官塲應酬，不過這在他的生活當中，算是「閑」事，至於「正」事，他好像永遠不談，用他自己的話說，只做着「啦啦隊長」，這就是說他只在旁邊耆，不參加進去，看到好處或熱閙節目就鼓鼓掌，叫叫好。</p>
<p>風趣的內容，配上幽默的語調，總是令人捧腹。秦腔，皮黃，和陜西的地方曲子，他是樣樣精通。生丑凈旦，他也是門門都成。因此，有人說，只要張翔老在塲，什麼戯都可以開台，差什麽角色，他都可以補。有些人認爲他這些一行爲是一種「苦悶的象徵」，而他自己的解釋是：「我愛這個玩意兒」。</p>
<p>慷慨輸將　獻出家產</p>
<p>兩個月前，當全國救濟特捐發動的時候，張翔初第一個把他祖遺的房屋一所，約値二十億，捐給國家，電呈總統，以表愛國之熱忱。他此舉取得了衆人的喝采。尤其是當那些錢更多的人一毛不拔，都在整天哭窮的時候，這個老人却慷慨輸捐，第一個交出了自己的家產。這種豪爽的精神，的確可以使豪門嗇鬼，愧煞妬殺。記者和他談起閒話時，他說：「我又不好名，不圖利，怕出風顯，把祖產交出來，不過是本份罷了」。</p>
<p>談及時局　妙語如珠</p>
<p>談起了目前局勢，他更是妙語連篇，令人絕倒，他說話的語調，是標準的長安話：「現在是夏天，共匪好像是蠅子，看起來亂哄哄的，其實這是氣數，冬天一來，「失的」一個都尋不見咧，要個看的都沒有。」接着他又說：「咱們現在是保家安鄕，人總是愛着自己的故鄉的，所謂故土難忘。「失的」美國倒好，咱却不愛，咱爲是不給他捐錢，那隔行着呢，咱愛不成，人家也不要咱愛，南京上海，江南天府倒不錯，咱也不留戀，爲啥呢？那和咱沒關係，沒個熟人沒有個人的東西祖墳，人家再好，與咱沒事。你看咱陜西北山裏（即陜北），一片黃土，山窮地壤，可是咱總留連不捨，因爲那是咱的麽！那裏親戚朋友，熟人鄕黨都有關係，你說瞎（壤），那是咱的，你說人家地方再好，那是人家的。所以北山人總說北山好。」</p>
<p>以財發身　是謂仁者</p>
<p>仁者以財發身，不仁者以身發財！」在張先生的眼中，有錢人只有這兩種。「仁者」是常常把錢做些好事，功成名得，錢使他得到了榮譽。「不仁者」以提起發財連命都不要咧，「失的」命都沒咧，要錢做球呢？</p>
<p>所以在這個時候，大家都把錢拿出來，不管是已掙的或是祖先遺下的。自己酌量捐出。金錢和生命是正比例，如果誰能捐出十億，誰的生命價値就値幾個十億，誰能捐獻千億萬億，則他的身價一定超乎千萬億。</p>
<p>「俗話說的好：留得靑山在，不怕沒柴燒，球呢只要有人在，如果過去能掙錢，現在能掙錢，將來還能掙錢。錢是身外物，去了又會來。</p>
<p>開封戰役　感慨萬千</p>
<p>開封之戰，對有錢的人不啻是一個警吿。如果在平時一毛不拔，等到戰火燒到脚跟上，那就遲了，張先生對這事很感慨的說：「開封這一仗，打壤的盤子，碗碟，桌子，樣子，是有數的，如果細細算起，不過若干億。無法估計的是「生命」，因爲死者的生命是不可以數目來計算的，有錢人如果不拿出錢來，那些人眞是自己尋死！」</p>
<p>現在全國各地，救濟特捐的獻納者，還是寥寥無幾，我們記出這個拿得起，放得下的「人的權範」，對於有錢的人，應該是很好的榜樣。</p>

<h3>杭州沒有豪富？</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十一日訊〕杭州，在勝利後的幾年來，始終站在安逸幸福的地位，她受着外來豪富們的滋養，經濟情形也並不顯得凋敗，所以，在舉世戰亂的今天，她實在是名實相符的「天堂」了。</p>
<p>但自從政府發起舉辦救濟特捐以後，這「天堂」裏却也惹起了一些紛擾，有錢的人正籌議如何逃避這豪富的頭銜，於是各奔門路，挽人說項，另有一批人，則把救濟特捐輕輕地擱置在一邊了。</p>
<p>有錢人的口號</p>
<p>杭市報業公會偏偏在這當兒，發動市民對豪富投票選舉運動，郵政管理局同情這一椿義舉，特別免費贈與信箱一隻，於是有錢的人又起了紛擾，叫出了「杭州沒有豪富」的口號。報業公會貫徹初衷，一定要舉辦這一樁選舉，當將臨開票的前一星期，向市參議會商借大禮堂作爲開票的塲所，市參議會在座談會席上，有一位參議員說：「抗州根本沒有豪富。」又有人說：「報業公會眞是小題大做。」他們愈談愈激昂，結果，說報業公會這次要借市參議會的禮堂，與章程不合，他們的章程有一條是要對市民有關係的始能出借。因此，斷然的拒絕了。</p>
<p>參會拒借禮堂</p>
<p>原來在杭市參議員的心目中，這選舉豪富的事情與全市市民無關，甚至比「禁止餛飩担擊柝聲」的提案還要小幾倍，他們認爲選舉豪富沒有什麽作用，也沒有什麽意思。這個拒絕，惹起了杭市報業界的反感，於是一致著評，批駁市參議會不借禮堂的不當。</p>
<p>開票的時候市政府市參議會等機關都派去了代表，大家問市參議會的代表，爲什麽不借禮堂？他說，這不是他的主張！</p>
<p>開出票來，有許多人詳列着某人的財產，有許多人說明着某人成爲豪當的原因，有許多人揭發着某人搖身數變，致成今天的豪富。票子一共有四千多張，許多豪富都被列舉了出來，報業公會就此送給政府做參考。</p>
<p>政府方面對於豪富提名的辦法，就是着各同業公會提名，而各同業公會幾經商討，再加硏究的結果，同復政府却是「沒有豪富」！記者曾經問過政府，這樁「救濟特捐」的懸案如何善後？他們說：「看上海如何？我們再作決定！」</p>
<p>特別捐的對象</p>
<p>從前有「愛國不甘後人」的義士，有「仗義輸財」的好漢，現在，現在政府保護的到底是那些人？而這些人爲什麼不肯一盡義務？</p>
<p>上海市市長吳國禎已行文到杭州，催解特別捐，然而杭州的特別捐，對象還沒有找到，這些特別捐還不知出在什麽人的身上？</p>
<p>這幾天來，杭州市上正在競選某金融機關的X事，款宴嘉賓，分頭活動，眞不知要化多少金錢？如果把這一筆錢來充作救濟特捐，恐怕救濟特捐也可以交帳了。</p>
<p>最近，杭州市的物價又起大波動，豪富們一轉手，一瞬眼，一個電話，一個手勢，進出都在千萬億以上，如果抽出一些利息來，恐怕救濟特捐也不會落空的！</p>

<h3>市長接受米商請求　食米限價昨再放寬　場外喊價已突破三千萬大關</h3>
<p>昨日米市塲交易已有少數做開，但喊價扶搖直上，突破三千萬元大關。昨晨九時，南北兩米市塲代表印福祥·胡文安等，曾至市政府向吳市長請求，將限價放寬，以維正當營業。當經市長用長途電話向行政院翁院長請示，結果得參照產區米價情形，加以決定。市長爲顧念本市米商實際困難情形，准許將南北米市塲白粳限價，放寬至二千八百五十萬。米商則向市長表示，願約束同業，絕不抬高價格交易。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕米價繼上週漲風，續創新高峯。平均較上週每石約高二百萬元至三百萬元，市塲價格，中白粳二千八百五十萬元，塲外喊價已突破三千萬大關，白粳爲三千一百萬元。昨日到貨稀少，南市塲到貨二〇二八石，北市塲到貨四百石，共僅到貨二四二八石。</p>
<p>至漲價原因：（一）由於無錫產地糧價昂騰不已，無錫·常州。等地大戶，吸收上海食米，致來源枯竭。（二）業外各物不斷上升，刺激人心。（三）散戶均有猛力吸進，市價哄抬益烈。</p>
<p>昨晤社會糧食科吉科長，詢渠有無對策，渠頻頻搖首，惟稱：「此非單純之米價問題，從另一角度觀察，此非物價上漲，實乃法幣跌價也。」</p>
<h3>汕糧狂升</h3>
<p>麵粉獨吿下跌，乃因銀根奇緊之故，晨開聞米市疾升，及廠商停止拋售，尙欲掙扎，老軍開九百三十萬，後市退至八百九十萬，反軟十五萬。兵船建成紅蜂各小十萬，麩皮做六八五萬。</p>
<p>雜糧漲勢瘋狂，黃豆議價雖已經提高二成，車豆以不超過一千七百萬，乍豆不超過一千五百萬爲度，結果，車豆以一六八〇萬，乍豆一四九〇萬略有成交。紅糧苞米北帮緊吸不已，前者漲六百萬，後者漲五百萬。芝蔴升五百萬，生仁加七百萬，揀靑揀白提高三四百萬，菉豆砌高三百萬。</p>
<p>食油直綫飛升，已恢復自由買賣，淨生油開七千八百萬，本廠豆油做六千六百萬，升六百萬，生菜油六四〇〇萬，吉桶大車六九〇〇萬，吉桶小軍七四〇〇萬，高四〇〇萬，豆餅客帮去化活躍，自七百五十萬開盤，告升至七百九十萬，而八百十萬，暴升三成。</p>

<p>鎭江　〔本報鎭江十二日電〕鎭物價繼續上竄，高米今售兩千九百萬，豆油售七千萬，麵粉則迫千萬，省警局爲撲滅漲風，特出動幹員，大捕不法商人，僅三數小時，卽査獲不遵議價售賣黑市之店丰十餘人，均經逮捕，解總局訊辦。</p>

<h3>華股高檔盤旋　後市紛告漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨先盤俊俏，晨市由高而回，近午一度虛疲。無如實貨仍具彈力，環境上益以平行綫本票流言，後市漲停後再有貼價。，晨初仍承上週餘威，開高不少</p>
<p>永紗以九二五〇元登塲，自九三〇〇元新高峯起，被賣到八七五〇元，二三號六五號等進至八八八〇元，惟紗布實貨均有回跌，大戶存多塞出，一四號一〇四號等紛紛了結，再跌至八六二〇元低價。近午業中人心好轉，紗布亦稍回上，一二號一五二號等力購，午收升為八八一〇。上泥新股亦吿漲停板，火柴跌停後有回。較上週六計美亞升半成，大通好一成，火柴麗安國貨閘北商務榮豐統益永公跌半成，中絲恒豐一成，餘股升降咸微。</p>
<p>後市永紗上場九二〇〇元，人心興奮，七一號一六九號等進至漲停板，此後十九漲停，熱股再有貼價成交，永紗先加四百元，新光景福一二元，美亞十元，後謠傳國行差進，曾回小到一百元，終以國行交換差出不少，最後約加半板成交。除火柴榮豐聯華商務國貨五和景榆恒豐華新信誼各升半成至成半外，餘均漲停。塲外各未上市股票，除世界大生躍升二成强外，餘者穩健逾恒。</p>

<h3>結匯證明書　售價昨大漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自結匯證明書制度實施後，出口業較過去活躍，六月份出口外匯達五千萬美元左右，創本年內最高之紀錄，預計本月之出口額，不致低於前月。惟目前國內物似迭漲，影響出口物資之成本，間接影響其在海外之銷路，則爲可慮。以僑匯而言，五月份竟少至九億元，六月份實施新制後，已有提高，目前僑匯之折合，得參照市價，特殊優待，預料今後必有起色。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日外匯結匯證明書售價大漲，最高喊至三三〇萬，三百萬時成交最多，較上星期六上漲八十萬元以上。</p>
<h3>廈門銀根奇緊　無法應付僑匯</h3>
<p>〔本報厦門十一日電〕日前鉅額僑匯涌湧至，因市面銀根奇緊，各民信局無法應付，致僑眷憤激，事態嚴重。昨在市府督促下，雖分發一批，但大額款項，仍無法兌現。據民信局負責人稱：六月份抵市僑匯約二萬億，全部付淸。此次三萬億，數額頗鉅，昨雖有游資四千億應市，相差數額尙多，希望政府能予協助，以解目前嚴重局勢。又昨一部份僑匯分發後，物價特漲，尤其美鈔每元售三六〇萬，迭成市塲紛亂，日內若全部發淸，則漲風當更劇烈。</p>
<h3>人心虛軟供過於求　棉紗布均見軋小　當局稱將大量拋售花紗布</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因上週漲風太熾，客銷熟稀，又逢業外物資回降，同業銀根趨緊，買戶相繼競售。開盤後熱門紗仍鮮供應，雜牌貨則充斥於市，喊價盤抬，致去胃呆滯，市盤猛瀉。最後四十二支藍鳳聞喊十四億有賣戶，但乏受戶，結果十四億五，軋小一億五。四十支人鐘價做十三億三千萬。卅二支五彩星十一億四千萬，廿一支雙馬十一億，均隔日出貨，竟無一人問津。將近收時，因股市回低，棉布疾降，價再下挫，結果軋跌一億二千萬，全日成單卅六張，做開一百四十六件</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因傳當局將實行査倉，更以紡建公司週六供售甚夥，銀根趨緊，浮多斬售，塲外能頭細布由三千八百四十萬喊開，北帮傾吐，散戶跟售，市呈供過於求，市盤疾退至三千四百八十萬，卒稍回上至五百萬結束，比週末軋跌一成强。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰在紡建大量配售下，同業轉賣，行盤軋小六百零五萬元，其餘各檔細布回小外，惟士林布粗布漂布元布納夫妥等，均續挺俏自一百萬至一千三五百萬不一。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司標售南洋廠出品之足球細布，及無錫慶豐廠出品之雙魚細布二種，布業目塡價，約在三千三百萬至三千二百五十萬左右。</p>
<h3>鉅額紗布　未見拋出</h3>
<p>又訊：國行劉攻芸昨日上午宣佈，將大量拋售花紗布五萬億元，市塲頗受威脅，紗布紛紛見小，下跌一成左右，市面納胃亦不甚暢。結果行局僅拋出紗布總金額共一億四千五百餘萬，至布疋中紡雖準備出售，然無銷路。中紡代紗管會在市塲拋紗一二九件，總金額爲二〇，一〇九，〇〇〇萬</p>
<h3>市面現鈔缺乏　銀行開發本票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市塲謠傳，中央銀行發行定額本票一節，據該行負責當局稱：絕無其事。惟因籌碼不足，特准市銀行開發大量之五十萬元本票，以供機關發薪之用。又國行當局鑒於日來物價漲勢驚人，決定實行大量拋售物資，希望於未來數日之內，吸收五萬億之頭寸，期以抽緊銀根之途徑，阻止物價之激漲。</p>
<p>本市金融界之意見，則認爲物價漲勢若此，市面籌碼平感不足，大鈔之發行，僅爲時間問題。惟目前人心浮動，發行大鈔，將使國民對法幣之信心更爲動搖，於物價之影響至大；此爲國行當局主要之考慮。</p>
<h3>繳解紗布價款　新辦法今實施</h3>
<p>關於中紡配售各紗號解款新辦法，中紡規定自今（十三）日起實施，規定自是日上午十二時以前繳款者，得以銀行本票或支票解入，逾時應以銀行封簽之現鈔繳付，否則不予收受。幷嚴格規定，凡退票一次者，即取銷承配資格。</p>
<h3>收購原棉工作　逐漸陷於停頓</h3>
<p>關於原棉之收購問題，其購得之數量目前已逐漸减少，甚至已有一部份陷於停頓，據該業業中人談稱：原棉收購减少之原因極多，其最主要者有三：（一）主要產區陜西省等地刻已禁止外運；（二）次要產區如洛陽，襄陽，新城等地交通迭遭破壞，幾無法修復，產棉亦無法運來；（三）其他各產區之棉農，對法幣失信用，非以銀元或銀角子交易，決不售出。事實上花紗布管理委員會，決無法在滬收購大量銀元，前往收購棉花，且亦爲政府法令所嚴　，在此三種困難，原棉收購工作，祗有逐步陷入停頓之境，本市原棉供應前途，實未可樂觀云。</p>
<h3>人絲初疲後堅</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市受當局監視而挫降，終因圈外物價回升而堅挺，結果與上週六價相仿。一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤喊價十九億元，交易靜寂，行情頻降，中午收盤卽期降至十六億五千萬元，隔日期加八千萬元之譜。下午開盤十八億八千萬元，收盤降小二千萬元，最後塲外行情，又升爲十九億三千萬元。</p>
<p>廠經　昨市上午下挫，下午回升，終比上週六價各級均大二三千萬元不等。上午高零担降至十八億五千萬元有交易，下午升至十九億七千萬元有成交，B字等級做開二十億〇五千萬元。干經二八分零担喊價，仍在十五億元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨　昨市降後堅挺，眞絲被面最大隔日期做十億〇五千萬元，最小卽期價降至八億八千萬元，收市卽期九億三千萬元，格子　縐做三百廿五萬元。下午被面行情，塲外又高出十億元關外。</p>
<h3>茶市人心振奪</h3>
<p>自猛烈之漲風，於上週末，直向本市商品市塲，頻頻侵襲後，各物均起波動，茶葉市况，亦見起色。惟昨日市上，晨開尙無變化，旋聞米糧等迭創高峯，故人心爲之更振，執主漸萌扳守之念，喊價急遽向上，漫無止境。價格方面，絢爛非凡，至査交易，則在吐納談判相持中，做開並不盛熾。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>火油昨市喊價紊亂，聞四十六度桶油限價爲一億一千八百萬，貨主則須以一億二三千萬肯吐，聽裝喊價亦哄高至一千六百萬元。</p>
<p>煤球限價每担二百卅萬元，昨以原料及百物上揚，黑市步昂，聞廠盤亦已提高爲每噸五千三百六十萬。</p>
<p>肥皂市面以原料燒碱每桶漲至七億大關，結果黃祥茂喊高至三千二百萬元，固本四千二百萬，箭刀四千一百萬，光華皂三千二三百萬。</p>
<p>木材市况，洋松柳安因結匯證書大漲，市價已穿出百萬元。杉木本貨市價昨平穩。</p>

<h3>如此法治！</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>德國紐侖堡大審案現在早已結束了，戈林以下十餘名納粹元凶，也早經處決了，但這樣一件理應是轟動全世界的大案件，其處決的方式却是事前事後都是嚴守秘密的。雖然審判的方式完全公開，起訴書的內容從法理叙到事實，長達數萬字，且死刑的宣判亦於公開爲之；然而對於死刑的執行，則除參與會審各國的代表和少數記者代表外，絕對保持秘密，而且不許攝影，事後也不許報紙有過份詳細與誇張的記述。據說所以如此，是恐防這一事件會被納粹的餘孽當做一件「殉道」的儀節看待；不過最重要的一點，是西歡的文明精神，早已不容許法律僅爲滿足「大快人心」的一種工具了。因爲要是徒求大快人心，則如戈林之類的戰犯，根本不待審閒，早可以在「遊街示衆」之後「斬首號令」，然後再予「暴屍三日」的。</p>
<p>然而反顧我國的執法者，對於法治精神的理解，似乎仍未脫離「遊街示衆」和「斬首號令」之類的原始文明階段。我沒有研究過法律，不知現在的法律條文中是否有准許遊街示衆的一條。不過記得不久前當局曾因其次槍斃日本戰犯前曾有遊街示衆的行爲，致引起外報批評，譏我野蠻，而通令禁止過。對於已判死刑即待執行的戰犯而尙不許遊街，足證我當局猶能尊重現代法治的文明精神。</p>
<p>可是前天本埠的中外報紙却又出現了兩名嫌疑奸商在解送法院途中的遊街鏡頭。投機奸商之應該嚴懲，固早爲衆口一詞，但我相信除少數「法塲上的觀衆」外，一般人民所要求於法律的，是正義的保障而非僅僅感情上的一時痛快。縱使「遊街示衆」確是法有明文的一種懲罰，然在尙未確定罪狀以前而先予執行，終不是一個在提倡法治聲中國家應有的現象。現在這兩名投機嫌疑犯已在法院交保待審中，則其縱有犯罪嫌疑，推想起來，大槪也不致嚴重到「先斬後奏」的程度。萬一而法院宣告無罪，則彼等之受遊街處分，豈非在保障人權的呼聲中，又多了一頁「寃獄」的紀錄？</p>
<p>遊街示衆方過去，「殺一儆百」和「借頭」的呼聲又來了。而且居然有人執筆爲文，在報章上公然呼號「借個頭來」。我眞不敢相信我們究竟處身在怎樣的一個社會中。這不免使我想起法國大革命時期的羅伯斯比來了；然而這位好以「借頭」來博取羣衆們歡性歡呼的殘忍的政治家，終於自己也上了他手創的斷頭台。我常聽人說亂世應用重刑，但我總懷疑它的效果。</p>
<p>在有智識之士而猶信任感情應駕馭理性的今日，實不得不爲我國的法治前途悲。我們今天的處境也許還遠談不上嚴格實施法治，但除非已經完全失掉對人類文明的進步信心，我們是應該爭取國家的法治精神的。尤其是負有執法重任的國家官吏，更應隨時審愼他的權力的運用，以免侵犯了法律的尊嚴，而招致外人的　　。</p>
<p>然而我們今日所患者，却正在有許多身負執法責任的人，還不能澈底理解法治精神的所在。無論在他們的談話中與公務行爲上，隨時都可發現這種的缺憾。例如不久前曾有某方面發表談話，謂此後如再發見冒充軍人，當予發往前綫當兵。意思無非是說你旣喜歡冒充軍人，那就送你當兵去吧。講痛快，這辦法自然是再痛快也淡有了。然而冒充軍人明明是干法紀的，而當兵在現代國家是一種榮譽。將犯罪與榮譽混爲一談，豈非仍舊是「好鐵不打針，好人不當兵」的謬誤觀念在作怪？於法旣不合，而更無意中損害了軍譽！</p>
<p>再如將剃「和尙頭」作爲一種處罰的手段，亦不免是超鎚了法治的正軌。舞女大班是怎樣一類人物，想來讀者都比我知道得詳細，「掗台子」和剝削舞女，當然有違警章，但「和尙頭」究與犯罪有甚麽關係呢？也許因爲監獄中的男犯都是剃「和尙頭」的，所以就成了罪犯的微象。不過這種解釋究竟勉張。監犯之所以剃「和尙頭」，想來原意僅爲省時省錢；好像新生活運動亦曾提倡過包括頭髮在內的整潔運動，而當今政府要人中，更不乏是剃和尙頭的，軍人尤大半如此。所以和尙頭決不應作是一種懲罰的標誌。而現在居然有人如此設想，如此行動，寗非怪事？</p>
<p>也許有人說法律是死的，人是活的，死的條文應由活人去解釋，然而最大的危險却正就是這種似是而非的曲解。條文固然不會開口，要人去解釋，但白紙黑字，畢竟尙有可循的範圍。如果人人得照自己的幻想與方便隨便化之爲權力，隨便加諸於他人，則我們又何必要有法律，要有層層的法院機關，以及最高法院的判例解釋呢？何况以上所舉的幾個實例，根本是無視法律，更說不上是解釋法律了。要是我的判斷沒有錯，那祇籠說是封建意識在作怪，是「法塲觀衆」心理與「大快人心」之類的意識在作怪罷了。然而這種意識却正是法治精神的阻碍！</p>
<h3>參觀各中學自然科成績展覽</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>卅年以前，我們即已高喊過「賽因斯先生」，但卅年以後，賽光生尙未光臨。今日中國人民所最缺乏的，都是一些文明國家小學生的起碼常識。</p>
<p>因此，這一次上海各中學的自然學科成績展覽會，與其說是對學生的，不如說是對人民的。我在展覽曾揭幕的次日，步入第一會塲（格致中學內），發現那許多有趣的科學表演和科學標本儀器的陳列及說明，吸引了不少老百姓，這不能不使我暗暗稱喜。今日之下，有人在幹科學知識的宣傳，這宣傳實在是世上所有「宣傳」中最乾淨，最可貴的。</p>
<p>這裏陳列了許多學校的展覽品，每一件都包含着無盡的知識。展覽品最完備而又編列最精細最美觀的，要算緝梁中學（即前聶中丞華童公學），一共陳列了三個敎室，動物，植物，礦物及物理化學方面的標本，敎具，以及敎師和學生所製作的，收集的不下數千種，這對於歷史較短的學校是不可能的，因爲收集需時又需錢。我最欣賞他們所編列的那些昆虫生活史，人類取火史，種種害虫的大　隊等，大可令離開學校已久的人，重新複習一下以往的功課。當我吿別緝　展覽室的時候，一位生物敎員正拿了一顆人頭骨，說明爲什麼打人打在太陽穴最容易致命，許多人都睜着眼靜聽。</p>
<p>大德助產學校的展覽品，也令人駐足不去，尤其那活動的受孕模型，吿訴人們不應忽略的常識，但在舊道學的觀念下，這常識有很多人不能甚解。許多怪胎，例如沒有頭蓋骨，腦部暴露的小孩，令人毛骨悚然，此外宣傳舊式接生的危險，要孩及孕婦的疾病的標本，實在都是意義深長的。</p>
<p>再入格致中學的展覽室，裏面正在表演電動車的行駛。火山的爆發，也圍了許多人。尤其無綫電操縱飛機的模型，頗使我戀戀不去。這東西道理本來很簡單，但於常識貧乏的中國，却有許多人覺得「無駕駛負飛機」太神秘了。</p>
<p>這展覽會是成功的，但令我發生懷疑的是：尙沒有發現那一校的教材標本中，有關於原子能及原子彈的東西，即使是簡單的圖解也付缺如，是否中學生的功課中尙未提到這一件廿世紀的一大常識？</p>
<h3>小統計</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>美國郵局宣布，現在尙有價値三千二百萬美元的匯票沒有人去兌現，這些匯票都已存局一年以上，其中最老的一張還是一八六三年開出去的。</p>
<p>據美國柯里安週刋統計，現在美國人財產在百萬美元以上的共八千人，其中倒有四千四百七十五人住在加里福尼亞·伊利諾愛·麻薩諸賽茲·紐約·滬海渥·賓夕爾凡尼亞等六個州。</p>
<h3>集郵</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>從經濟的眼光看來，集郵也是一種投資。據「新聞週報」的統計，某幾種美國郵票在過去十年中每年增値百分之八至十。</p>
<p>以　城的一個布商亨利·包爾頓爲例。他於一九一二年決定每年以一百五十元投資於郵票。詳細的硏究過市價之後，他發現紀念郵票是利之所在，於是，他便專門收集這種郵票。十七年之後，他已投資了兩千五百元，但是，他的郵集的時價却値十萬元了！多厚的利潤啊。</p>
<p>這似乎是痴人說夢，不過，讀者如有懷疑，儘可以歷年的「史各脫郵票目錄」上所標註的價目核對。在一九四六年，有一個集郵家以六千美金的代價售出一百套齊柏林航空郵票。這些郵票是他於一九三一年按票面以四百五十五元從郵局買進的。另外一個集郵家最近賣掉五十套一九三三年發行的福克闌島百週年紀念郵票，票面合計不過七百五十元——這也就是他的成本——可是，他所換得的却是九千大元。</p>
<p>假如你　集　除了嗜好之外還含有投資的成份，那末，便不要太注意圖案的美麗。大多數的美麗的郵票因爲在發行時收藏的人就很多，所以多年之後價格還是漲不了多少——郵票也和其他的貨物一樣受「供求定律」的影響的。英屬幾內亞在一八五六年所發行的一分郵票，圖案之簡陋無以復加，可是，如今一枚却値美金五萬元。年代對郵票的價格也無大影饗。英國在一八四〇年首度發行的一便士黑色郵票，到如今也不過値二十五元，並且限於未用過的。而尼幾亞在一九三八年發行的四便士桔紅色郵票，不過十年工夫，身價就昇到八塊錢，一百年後値多少錢，更無人能預測了。</p>
<p>假如你決定投資於集郵，你應該知道一些有關郵票的常識——它們的歷史，發展，和發行情形。不出數年，你的投資便會付給你令人難以置信的高利。</p>
<h3>生財有道</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>翻開報紙，一方一方的短期存款的廣吿老是炫耀着人們的兩眼。利息天天在加，三個月對本利，眞是很「優厚」的了。今天偶然翻閱一册新借得的原版書，裏面有一則星相家的故事，頗耐人尋味。</p>
<p>紐約的星相家新發明了一個「男女隨意」的方法。即夫婦可隨意選擇嬰兒的性別。付美金五十元，即可學習這個方法。若擇男而生女，擇女而生男，則賠錢五十五元。這個方法粗粗看來，也是很「優厚」的，至少不能算是騙人。但稍加分析，則面目全非。統計學家吿訴我們：世界上男女生產率大凡是相等的。假如紐約年產二十萬嬰孩，則大槪有十萬是男的，十萬是女的。因此只要有一百對夫婦去請益這個星相家，就算他額角低，猜錯了五十對，扣去二千七百五十元賠款，也可以凈賺美金二千二百五十元。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>「進士」即是利名的最高階段，每逢「丑」「辰」「未」「戌」之年（此指正科，照例三年一次，若加恩科則不拘此限），全國各省舉人齊集京師應考，由特簡之大臣主持，內外廉，前後三塲，將一兩萬的「孝廉公」選取二三百人，謂之「會試」。榜上有名者，仍須經過「殿試」（不在闈塲，而在皇宮大殿，且以皇帝的名義，出題策問，隆重無比），乃成「進士」，共分三甲，第一甲例只三人，特別優待，即時授職進翰林院，第一名爲修撰（如南通張謇），第二第三授編修（如現居北平之兪陛　），第二甲及第三甲各若干人，則只給「進士」「周進士」出身，須經「朝考」，再甄別，再榜示，最優者爲「庶吉士」入翰林院學習，次者用主事分發各部，再次者用中書入內閣，再次者用知縣分發各省。故每科進士二三百人中，得入翰林衙門不過數十人，而此數十名庶吉士，仍須入庶常館學習期滿，再經甄別試，優者授職編修及檢討，次者仍分發其他各衙門及各省爲主事爲知縣，謂之「散館」。凡「散館試」而留院授職者，乃爲完全之翰林。其散館改官者，雖已離院，但曾經「庶吉士」一階段，是進過翰林院的人，若稱爲翰林，尙可將就。如熊希齡未及做館，即逢戊戌政變，被革，但他確曾入翰林。所以稱爲「熊老翰林」，亦有些根據</p>
<p>「翰林院」旣是衙門，進翰林院須由許多進士中選取，此是常例。而另有變例；（一）爲淸初之博學鴻詞科，由淸廷諭令內外各大省於文學素優資望崇隆之名流，不論有無科名，保送到京，加以御試，擇優授以翰林官。（讀講編檢庶吉士都有。）（二）是淸末之留學生考試，凡在東西洋學成歸國，在北京註册，定期考試，先按其學資及考試成績，分別賜給進士舉人出身，再行考分等第，授翰林，部曹，小京官，知縣等職。如現在上海之顏惠慶駿人，在南京之吳鼎昌達拴，都是由留學生考試進的翰林院（顏授編修，吳授檢討）。雖然他們沒有經過鄕會試，但旣授職進院，則「金頂朝珠褂紫貂」之榮華，「玉堂金馬」之名貴，便與由舊科塲而進的一律。距今已近四十年矣，足可事受「老翰林」之稱。</p>

<h3>Selection of Grand Justices and Examination Committee Members: The Control Yuan's Heated Review, Voting Possible Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] To exercise its power of consent over the President's nominations for Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and members of the Examination Yuan, the Control Yuan held plenary review committees both in the morning and afternoon of the 12th. Members extensively expressed their opinions, and a decision was made to continue the meeting at 9 AM on the 13th to continue the review. It is rumored that separate reviews may be conducted on the 13th. If all goes smoothly, a vote on consent may be held in the afternoon of the 13th. It has been learned that the focus of the heated discussions at today's meeting, chaired by Zhao Shou-xuan in the morning and Liang Shang-dong in the afternoon, was the uneven distribution by region. For example, no one was selected from frontier provinces such as Ningxia and Qinghai, while there were many from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Most members believed that regional allocation was the most important factor, so the discussion lasted a long time without a conclusion. Furthermore, the Control Yuan Secretariat has completed preparations for the exercise of the power of consent, such as printing the consent ballots.</p>
<p>Presidential Message to the Control Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The President's message to the Control Yuan regarding the Grand Justices and Examination Committee members is as follows:</p>
<p>A.

It is known that Hong Wen-lan and 16 others have either served as judges of the Supreme Court or as legislators for many years, possessing profound knowledge and experience; or have thoroughly studied the Constitution and understand political essentials; or have served as law professors with a good reputation; or have produced legal works that are highly regarded in scholarly circles. All are qualified to be selected as Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan. Therefore, in accordance with Article 79, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, I request your consent for their appointment. Respectfully submitted, President Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>B. Requesting consent for the appointment of Shen Shi-yuan and 18 others as members of the Examination Committee: In accordance with Article 84 of the Constitution, the Examination Yuan shall have a number of members of the Examination Committee, who shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan.

<h3>Control Yuan Members Donate One Day's Income to Comfort Generals and Soldiers in the Central Plains</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The Control Yuan held a general meeting at 9:50 AM on the 12th, chaired by President Yu. He raised the question of whether to resume the session immediately and sought opinions. Some people pointed out that the Organic Law of the Administrative Commissioner's Office had not yet been passed, while the former Control Department of the National Government was still exercising its functions. They questioned whether there would be conflicts and requested that the session be resumed immediately. Cao De-xuan stated that it was not necessary to raise it for discussion and that the session should be resumed immediately. This was passed without dissent. Subsequently, the 17th meeting began at 10:00 AM sharp. In addition to the Secretariat reading the minutes of the 16th meeting and the letters and telegrams of leave requests from members, the Presidential Office's reply regarding the results of convening the presidents of the Legislative, Control, and Judicial Yuans to discuss the legal proposals submitted by the Control Yuan was also read. After the reporting items were completed, President Yu proposed a temporary motion by Cao De-xuan and 56 others: "With the great victory in the Central Plains war, celebrations are being held everywhere. The members of this Yuan should also express our support. In addition to sending a telegram of condolences, we should also donate one or three days' income to present to the generals and soldiers fighting bandits on the front lines to express our respect." The entire committee unanimously agreed to send a telegram of condolences and donate one day's income, which was then passed. Subsequently, two consent items were carried out: A. The President's proposal to appoint Hong Wen-lan and 16 others as Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan, requesting consent. B. The President's proposal to appoint Shen Shi-yuan and 18 others as members of the Examination Committee, requesting consent.

<h3>The President Holds a Tea Party to Host All Control Yuan Members</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The President held a tea party in the auditorium of the Presidential Palace at 6 PM on the 12th to host all Control Yuan members. The President delivered a speech, explaining two points: (1) Regarding the issue of the Control Yuan's right of proposal, if the Legislative Yuan proposes a solution, there would be many obstacles. Therefore, it is better to follow the legal path and have the Grand Justices interpret it. (2) The selection of Grand Justices and Examination Committee members has many practical difficulties regarding regional issues, but efforts will be made to remedy this in the future, and he hopes that all members will understand. After the President's speech, Control Yuan member Liang Shang-dong immediately stood up and gave a speech. Regarding the issue of the President's proposed right of proposal, he believed that it was no longer necessary to discuss it. However, the three fundamental laws of the Control Yuan, namely the Control Law, the Organizational Law of Various Committees, and the Organizational Law of the Control Yuan's Administrative Commissioner's Office, are the basis for the Control Yuan to perform its duties. If these three bills cannot be passed before the Legislative Yuan adjourns, the work of the Control Yuan will inevitably be hindered. Therefore, he hoped that the President could find a way to ask the Legislative Yuan to expedite the legislative process. Finally, the President stated that he could find a way to solve the problem, and the tea party adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee Passes the Commodity Tax Regulations</h3>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] At the meeting of the Health Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 12th, in light of the epidemic raging in Kaifeng after the disaster, the proposal by Wu Zhi-mei, Tang Guo-zhen, Lei Xian, and others was passed.

Each group worked with maximum efficiency to rush to calculate the budget figures. By the evening, except for the fifth group regarding the budgets of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Resources Commission, which still had some details to be decided, the other six groups had largely completed the preliminary review of the budgets of the various government departments under their responsibility as scheduled and were preparing to draft reports. The conveners of the Budget Committee will meet on the 13th to study various technical issues. The fifth group will also reconvene in the afternoon of the 13th to continue its internal review work. If the 19th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 13th cannot be completed before noon, the group will decide to hold a meeting in the evening, ensuring that it completes its unfinished tasks on the same day. This will prevent the overall meeting of the Budget Committee from being delayed on the morning of the 14th and allow the national general budget proposal to smoothly enter the comprehensive review stage.</p>
<h3>Legislators from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to Report and Participate Immediately, Constitutional Government Maintains the Spirit of Cooperation Among the Three Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Legislators from the Democratic Socialist Party have decided to come to the meeting on the 13th to report and participate in the Legislative Yuan, which is a good manifestation of the recent progress in the spirit of cooperation among the three parties. Lei Zhen, who is responsible for maintaining contact with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on behalf of the Kuomintang, told reporters on the 12th: Regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party attending the Legislative Yuan, the Democratic Socialist Party originally requested that the Kuomintang make concessions for five seats recently, so that the legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party who had already been elected could attend the Legislative Yuan meeting before the adjournment. However, the work of persuading them to concede was very difficult. Now, after the Kuomintang persuaded them to concede amidst extreme difficulties, an agreement is gradually being reached, but it has not yet been announced. The legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party, in light of the difficulty of national affairs, have decided not to wait for the announcement of the five seats and will attend the Legislative Yuan on the 13th to fulfill the original intention of sincere cooperation. We deeply admire and welcome the spirit of the legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party who put national affairs first, and sincerely hope that the legislators of the Youth Party can also attend the Legislative Yuan recently.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Legislative Yuan news: Legislative members of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhou Shu-sheng, Zhang Ting-zan, Yu Shao-xian, Tang Ru-mei, Hu De-yuan, Wang Han-sheng, Xiao Jue-tian, Hu Dao-yuan, Chai Chun-lin, Xie Zi-qing, Ji Zu-qian, Wang Shi-xian, Sun Ji-xu, Wang Sheng-ting, Li Tian-lin (female), Wang Xi-bin, Li Yu-hua, Xu Fu-lin, and others, a total of 18 people, are scheduled to take the express train from Shanghai to Nanjing on the night of the 12th and arrive on the morning of the 13th. The Legislative Yuan has sent Hou Zhong-yi, head of the Liaison Section, to the station to meet them. After the legislators get off the train, they will go directly to the Legislative Yuan to report, and then attend the 19th meeting of the Legislative Yuan. The General Affairs Section of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has prepared the badges, manuals, documents, and public funds to be received by each member, so that they can be sent immediately after the reporting procedures are completed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Zhou Zhen recently explained the fact that the Kuomintang has made concessions to legislators in detail and wrote a letter to members of the Democratic Socialist Party. Lei's letter was handed over to Sun Ya-fu of the Democratic Socialist Party on the 12th and sent to Shanghai by special messenger on the night of the 12th. Some people believe that after the legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party report collectively, the legislators of the Youth Party will follow suit, so the government after the implementation of the Constitution will continue to maintain the spirit of cooperation among the three parties without slackening.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The spokesman of the Youth Party stated last night that the party headquarters had notified the elected legislators in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to report to the Legislative Yuan and attend meetings starting today. It is reported that there are a total of five elected legislators from the Youth Party. When Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen negotiated in Shanghai last month, there was a proposal for the Kuomintang to concede five to ten seats to increase the number of legislators from the Youth Party. This matter is currently being seriously negotiated within the Kuomintang. The Youth Party, on the other hand, claimed that it required the original number of 41 seats, which would be made up by the Kuomintang legislators conceding in installments within three months.</p>
<h3>Sweden and Dominican Republic Award Medals to President Chiang</h3>
<p>Presented by the Envoys of the Two Countries to China</p>

<h3>Kuomintang Central Memorial Week, Minister He Reports on Military Affairs, Soldiers' Pay, Subsidiary Fodder Expenses, etc. Will Be Reasonably Adjusted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Minister He Yingqin attended the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week on the 12th and reported on the recent situation of military affairs. In his report, He first put forward several important items that the Ministry of National Defense has recently handled:</p>
<p>(1) Division of Personnel Authority and Responsibility. In order to meet the requirements of suppressing rebellion militarily, the central government has decided to divide the personnel of military officers into three levels: general, colonel, and lieutenant. The personnel of generals are managed by the Ministry of National Defense, the personnel of colonels are managed by the four general headquarters of the army, navy, air force, and logistics, and the personnel of lieutenants are managed by the military (reorganized division) and equivalent units. Each Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Pacification Commissioner's Office, and Military Control Area is responsible for the management of the personnel of colonels in the directly affiliated units, with reference to the general headquarters of each military service. All of the above-mentioned personnel management units are required to have an organization of a personnel evaluation committee. All personnel appointments, removals, transfers, merits, demerits, rewards, and punishments must first be publicly evaluated by the evaluation committee before being submitted to the principal officials of each level of personnel management for review and issuance. Regarding the standards for selection and promotion, it has been stipulated that (1) the front line shall be based on military exploits, (2) the rear shall be based on the results of reorganization and training (including training, management, hygiene, command, and all military administration), and (3) institutions and schools shall be based on service performance.</p>
<p>(2) Reasonable Adjustment of Soldiers' Pay, Subsidiary Fodder Expenses, and Public Miscellaneous Expenses. At present, the morale of the troops is low, and military discipline is poor, mainly because the officers and soldiers cannot be adequately fed and clothed. Moreover, because public miscellaneous expenses are insufficient, the troops often make up for it with shortages, which has a significant impact on combat effectiveness. In order to meet the needs of the facts and under the principle of not excessively increasing the burden on the national treasury, a method of adjustment has been formulated. A reasonable adjustment can be made to soldiers' pay, subsidiary fodder expenses, and public miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p>He also reported that the recent war situation in various battlefields was very auspicious.</p>
<h3>Minister Wang Reports on Prices, Plans to Implement Price Stabilization Plan Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The Ministry of Finance held a monthly meeting in the auditorium of the ministry at 10:00 AM on the 12th. Hundreds of ministry colleagues attended.

Wang first reported on his work since taking office as Minister of Finance, the first of which was to be busy with the preparation of the general budget for the second half of the year, and the second was to deal with the increasingly severe price problem. The general budget has now been prepared and is being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. The price problem has also been worked out by Premier Weng and himself and relevant ministries to formulate practical and effective measures, which will soon be implemented (see separate article). He then encouraged his colleagues to work on time, work hard, and hope that everyone will provide opinions on the current financial problems and related ministry affairs based on their research. He himself decided to carefully review them and start reading the opinions submitted by his colleagues after getting up at 5:30 AM every day. After Wang's report, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, reported on the work of the department. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu reported at the monthly meeting of the ministry on the morning of the 12th that although the current price increase is more worrying, Premier Weng and himself and relevant ministries have formulated a plan to stabilize prices. He believed that after the implementation, the rising trend can be curbed. Wang said in a very firm tone that he believed that there was absolutely a way to solve the price problem. As for the content of the proposed method and when it will begin to be implemented, Wang did not reveal it, but Wang once said that he absolutely believed that "Heaven never seals off all paths for man."</p>

<p>[Local News] Yan Jia-gan, a member of the American Aid Utilization Committee, told reporters on the 12th that whether the 60 million USD special American aid fund for construction will be reduced, and how the funds will be allocated, will be finally decided in mid-August after Stillman and others complete their investigation and submit a report to Washington. Currently, Stillman and others will go to the Huainan Coal Mine and other units to continue their investigation. American aid materials for general economic recovery will be shipped to China in large quantities starting in August. Most of the proceeds from the sale of these materials will be frozen to contract the currency, but a portion will still be allocated for other expenses. The use of these funds is expected to be discussed at a meeting this Thursday. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Journalists</h3>
<p>Recently, the Legislative Yuan held several discussions on military, diplomatic, and financial secrets, which were partially or completely leaked by several newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. This not only caused a great uproar in the Legislative Yuan but also sparked a debate in the public opinion regarding the scope of "freedom of the press." Standing in the position of journalists, we naturally feel particularly interested in this issue that concerns us directly.</p>
<p>Looking at the content of newspapers, there are news reports, opinionated commentary, advertisements that assist commodity exchange, and columns of text that satisfy readers' desire for knowledge. Its relationship with social life is indeed very close. Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, said, "Newspapers are the best tool to enlighten the people, helping them understand things and become a complete member of society." President Wilson also said, "Newspapers are the spiritual food of the nation." William, an American expert in journalism education, even regards newspapers as one of the three major forces promoting the progress of modern civilization. Chinese scholars and experts also emphasize the great responsibility of newspapers to society. Liang Qichao discussed the responsibility of newspapers, saying: "Newspapers are the foundation of politics and the teacher of teachers." Zhang Jiqiang, a journalist of the era, also said about the nature of newspapers: "On one hand, it should be operated as a commercial business, and on the other hand, it should bear the responsibility of actively supporting and advocating for the country and society."</p>
<p>Although China's newspaper industry is formally behind Europe and the United States, it was indeed able to fulfill its responsibility to the country and society during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Whether it was a private newspaper or a party-run newspaper, it was able to do its best to promote national policy and "certain victory in the War of Resistance" under a common belief of "nation first, country first." The result of Chinese journalists devoting themselves to serving the country through writing for eight years has not only gained the trust and respect of the people but also won international honors. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China's newspaper industry faced two major crises: one is an external crisis. Because the domestic war has continued, society is unstable, people's livelihood is declining, and prices are soaring, newspapers across the country are feeling the panic of material poverty. Many newspapers have even automatically ceased publication because they cannot survive. The second is an internal crisis. Because Chinese journalists have been stimulated by international trends, they are all obsessed with "freedom of the press," while often ignoring the "responsibility of the press." Because in the eyes of some journalists, they fully believe that freedom of the press is no different from allowing us journalists to break through barriers and do whatever we want. Therefore, whether in news reporting or in speech, they inevitably step out of the norm, and even abandon the nation's stance. The disputes in the press have emerged endlessly in the past three years, and the problems in the press in the future may still be on the rise, which is not necessarily caused by this internal crisis.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no incomprehensible or mysterious theory about freedom of the press. From its beginning, during World War II, enlightened people in various countries believed that if they wanted to achieve world peace after the war, and hoped it could be maintained for a long time, they must seek international freedom of the press. On one hand, it can promote understanding and cooperation among the people of various countries, and on the other hand, prevent the kind of secret diplomacy in the past from recurring in the future. At the same time, they also believed that if they want to maintain the democratic system in various countries, they must obtain domestic freedom of speech. Without criticism, there is no democracy. Theoretically speaking, this freedom of the press movement is a major innovation movement in the world's newspaper industry. But what is freedom of the press? Because of the short time, there has been no accurate explanation. Therefore, it has been abused by some people, and under the smoke screen of freedom of the press, they have unknowingly committed many sins. In March and April this year, the International Conference on Freedom of the Press was held in Geneva. Many resolutions were passed on freedom of the press. The most important one is the question of whether freedom of the press has a scope. It has been successfully adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission and established as a clause on freedom of the press. It stipulates that everyone has freedom of thought and speech, and these freedoms are part of human rights, and should not be interfered with by the government, but it also stipulates that freedom of the press must have its responsibilities and obligations, and must not exceed the following eight restrictions, otherwise it should be subject to legal sanctions. These eight restrictions are: (1) matters relating to national security interests that must be kept confidential; (2) speech inciting people to overthrow the government organization by violence; (3) speech inciting people to commit crimes; (4) speech corrupting morality; (5) speech undermining the fair trial of justice; (6) infringing copyright or copyright; (7) speech defaming the reputation of others; (8) systematic reports of false or distorted facts that slander friendship between countries or between people.</p>
<p>This clause on freedom of the press should be accepted by all people in the world who strive for human rights, love freedom, and uphold democracy. Here, we can not only understand the true meaning of freedom of the press, but also believe that although our current publishing law needs to be revised, it still has some value to be retained in principle. For example, Chapter 4, Restrictions on matters published, except for the phrase "intention to undermine the Chinese Nationalist Party" in the first item of Article 21, which may not be applicable to today's constitutional rule, the rest of the articles are generally applicable. It is heard that the government authorities will also revise this article. But recently, some people have advocated abolishing this publishing law, which is either "with ulterior motives," or theoretically distorts freedom of the press.</p>
<p>In short, as the ancients said, "One word can make a country prosper, and one word can ruin a country." Isn't it the same now? The reporter's pen is not only related to the honor and disgrace of the country and the safety of the world, but also the fate of mankind is tied to the hands of journalists. We recall that the reason why Chinese journalists were able to fulfill their responsibilities during the War of Resistance Against Japan, in addition to having a common belief of "nation first, country first," the National Political Council also formulated a wartime news policy, taking the program for the War of Resistance and National Construction as the standard, and determining five principles for news reporting, so that journalists across the country, whether writing commentary or reporting news, had a common rule to follow, so that they could achieve the goal of "concentration of will and concentration of strength." Now that we are still in the period of suppression of rebellions and national construction, there are many difficulties, and it is even more important to rely on the efforts of our journalists to fulfill our responsibility to the country and society within the scope of simultaneously emphasizing freedom of the press and responsibility of the press. The staff of this newspaper are willing to encourage each other with colleagues across the country!</p>
<h3>Great Construction Regrettably Overlooked Hainan Electric Power Plant in Critical Condition; Scale Second Only to Xiaofengman and Sun Moon Lake; Trapped in Bandit Areas, Eagerly Awaiting Government Relief</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] Today, I am reporting to the people of the country a great construction that has been overlooked. This construction is deeply and significantly related to our country's economy and national defense. However, it is currently being abandoned like worn-out shoes, which is regrettable. What is this construction? It is the Hainan Electric Power Plant in Guangdong Province. The scale of this plant is unmatched in water power generation in various provinces, except for Xiaofengman in Northeast China and Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan. After the Japanese occupied Hainan in the 29th year, because the island did not produce coal and petroleum, there was almost no other way for industrial power except for water power generation. Therefore, they established the Dongfang Hydroelectric Power Plant. After the Japanese surrendered in the 34th year, it was managed by the National Resources Commission and renamed the Hainan Electric Power Plant. The plant is located on the south bank of the Xinbei Dagang River in Dongfang Market, Ledong County. The river suddenly becomes a large bend at this point, and the river bank is steep, tens of meters high. The Japanese took advantage of the terrain to build dams and dig channels upstream of the waterfall to divert water for power generation. The dam is 427.65 meters long and 4.5 meters high. The diversion channel is a trapezoidal open channel, 3 meters deep, 6 meters wide, and 1,170.77 meters long, with a maximum capacity of 26 cubic meters per second. The effective capacity of the water tank is 3,000 cubic meters. The water pipe introduces water from the water tank into the power plant to drive the generator. The pipe is a soft steel pole with an inner diameter of 2.1 meters and a length of 62.24 meters. As for the motor equipment, there is a 7,000 kW vertical shaft single-input single-flow reaction hydraulic turbine, and a 7,000 (KVA) 11,000 volt 80-cycle three-phase synchronous AC generator directly connected to the hydraulic turbine. The voltage generated by the plant is 11,000 volts, which is increased to 66,000 volts through a transformer and sent into the transmission line, from the plant directly to the Huishui area, and then divided into southwest and north directions. One line passes through the Shilu Mine, and the other goes to Beili Basuo Port, with a total length of 80 kilometers. The plant has two substations, one located in the Shilu Mine in Baisha County, with four transformers, each with a capacity of 1,000 (KVA), and one located in Basuo Port in Ganen County, with four transformers, each with a capacity of 6,000 (KVA). According to the Japanese equipment and plan, the power generated by the plant, in addition to providing electricity for mines, farmland, and factories, is more than enough to supply lighting for the entire island. However, after the takeover, the communist bandits ravaged the area, and many takeover employees and engineers died. The 80-kilometer transmission line was destroyed from time to time. As of September last year, the transmission line had been completely destroyed. Although the plant's motors still generate electricity day and night, they are no longer able to transmit electricity to Beili and other places. The plant is now trapped in the core of the bandit area, surrounded on all sides. Since the power outage, not only all equipment and various materials cannot be transported elsewhere, but also the employees cannot enter or leave. Wages and rations are delivered every half a month by the garrison of the Beili Brigade. If the authorities do not take immediate action, the plant may not be preserved. The National Resources Commission has decided to end this original driving force for the electrification of Hainan. If it is realized, then the "Development of Hainan Island" currently touted by officials is simply deceiving. In a few years, Hainan Island may degenerate to a barren state before the War of Resistance.</p>

So far, the three main production areas along the river in Anhui, the Ma Hua Chang in Susong Wangjiang, the Guangji Dam in Tongcheng Huaining, and the Huangsi Beach in Wuwei, have not shown any dangerous situation. The water conservancy department has allocated materials for flood relief, such as more than 70,000 sacks, which have been distributed early in case of emergency. If the upstream does not rise and the sky has cleared, Anhui will not suffer a disaster. However, due to the rain, the breach of the Wanxingwei dike in Guichi, which was released into the river last winter, has not been opened, resulting in the submergence of 3,000 mu. The mountain flood in Yufengwei in Dongliu submerged 4,000 mu. Sheng will also inspect the Anhui River with the water conservancy department's water survey boat, which will depart from Nanjing immediately.</p>

<h3>Armed "Spy Terrorist Groups" Infiltrate Southern Border, All Captured, CCP Responds to Cominform Condemnation of Tito</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Belgrade, 11th] The Ministry of Internal Affairs announced today that the government has captured the number one war criminal it has been hunting for a long time, the Fascist party leader Bevric, who has been actively engaged in anti-Tito activities abroad in the past year. He sent 19 armed "spy terrorist groups," totaling 95 people, to infiltrate Yugoslavia, but they were detected and captured one by one by the police. Bevric's assistant Kavran was also among them.</p>
<p>They were all carrying small arms and radios and were acting on the orders of the so-called "Croatian National Committee," with the aim of creating terror and spying for foreign intelligence agencies. The official announcement of this matter is a warning to all countries participating in the Cominform who are attempting to send personnel into the country to overthrow the Tito government through conspiracy.</p>
<p>CCP Broadcast</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 11th] According to a broadcast from a CCP radio station in northern Shanxi picked up here on the 11th, Yugoslavia was condemned as a traitor to Marxism, and it was resolved to stand in line with the Cominform. The radio station said that the CCP's resolution "fully agrees" with the Cominform's resolution, rejecting the Tito regime. This is the responsibility that the Communist International should take to defend Marxism-Leninism and is an act of world peace and democracy, protecting the Yugoslav people from the aggression and欺侮humiliation of American capitalism. The resolution assesses Tito's actions as "rebellious and erroneous," which is vastly different from Marxism-Leninism and the difference between socialism and capitalism. The CCP hopes that the internationalists of the Yugoslav Communist Party will rise up and correct the mistakes of the Tito group. The broadcast also said that the international communist movement has also had similar situations within the CCP, such as the purging of Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao.</p>
<h3>South Korean Assembly Approves Constitution, New Government to be Established Next Month, Will Request UN Recognition</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 12th] The South Korean Constituent Assembly has approved the first democratic constitution, and the new government is expected to be established on August 15th, the third anniversary of the liberation of Korea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 12th] The Korean Assembly adjourned today after passing the draft constitution in its third reading by a vote of 162 to 1, and will reconvene on the 14th to discuss the government organization law. The passage of the constitution represents the first step in the establishment of an independent Korean national government, which will accept the authority of the U.S. military government in South Korea.</p>
<p>It is reported that the main points of the constitution are based on the constitution of our country: (1) Korea is named the Republic of Korea, or the Republic of Korea; (2) The Republic considers wars of aggression to be inappropriate actions; (3) The status of foreigners in Korea will be guaranteed within the scope of international treaties; (4) The president has a four-year term and has extensive administrative powers, including the appointment of cabinet members and ministers; (5) The representatives of the unicameral legislature have a five-year term; (6) Judicial independence; (7) Local autonomy; (8) The government or public operates important enterprises and resources; (9) Equality of men and women in marriage; (10) Land to the tiller.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 11th, Associated Press] The South Korean Assembly formally passed the constitution and resolved to begin organizing a democratic government on the 14th. The new government will gradually take over the responsibilities currently borne by the U.S. military occupation authorities in South Korea. The communist puppets in Soviet-occupied North Korea yesterday announced that their Soviet-style constitution had come into effect and that general elections in North Korea would be held on August 25th. The communists claim that this move is aimed at freeing Korea from foreign exploitation. Syngman Rhee, who will be the first president of South Korea, said that the South Korean Assembly would not consider the recent actions of the communists. He said: "We will do our best to cooperate with the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union has any good plans to propose, we are willing to have them go through the U.S. State Department and the United Nations at Lake Success." South Korea will ask the United Nations delegation to Korea to assist the Korean government in taking over the responsibilities of the U.S. occupation authorities. Rhee's wish is for the United Nations General Assembly to be held in Paris in September to unconditionally recognize the South Korean government. The United Nations must choose between the government established by the United States and the government established in North Korea after the elections on August 25th.</p>
<p>Due to space constraints today, the special feature on the Cominform will be continued tomorrow.</p>
<h3>U.S. Democratic Party Platform to be Submitted to the Convention Today, Convention Chairman Denounces Republican Party for Eight Sins</h3>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 12th] The drafters of the Democratic Party platform completed the "Roosevelt-Truman" draft platform on the 12th, emphasizing "our glorious achievements in the past sixteen years." The drafters, led by Senator Meyers, worked all night and did not adjourn until 3:30 AM on the 12th, remaining silent about the specific items in the platform.</p>
<p>Meyers said: "This platform states the purpose of our struggle in the past sixteen years, but I cannot reveal the content because the draft is only a suggestion and the Convention has the right to dissect it." When asked how the drafting committee dealt with the thorny issues of national rights, Pakistan, and the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, Meyers did not answer. These issues are likely to cause fierce debate at the Convention. Although Meyers said that the platform is the "Roosevelt-Truman" platform, the Southern representatives were not satisfied. They wanted to review the human rights portion of it before deciding whether to support Truman or withdraw from the Convention. Meyers said that he would submit the platform to the full committee for approval on the morning of the 13th and then submit it to the full representative convention on the afternoon of the same day.</p>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 12th] Democratic National Convention Chairman McGrath delivered a speech welcoming the Democratic delegates on the 12th, denouncing the Republican Party for eight sins. He called the Republican-controlled 80th Congress "forever memorable, because its harm is far greater than its meager successes, and its record is the most reactionary and regressive in our history." Therefore, to avoid a third world war and seek domestic prosperity, the "experienced" leadership of the Democratic Party is essential.</p>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 12th] The Democratic Party's anti-Truman movement in California has ended. James, son of former President Roosevelt, and 48 other delegates have announced that they will support Truman's nomination, while 13 others have not yet decided.</p>

<h3>Analysis of Price Increase Factors by Leaders from All Sectors: Speaker Pan States There Should be a Comprehensive Control Plan and Advocates for Establishing a National Institution</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The series of fierce price increases in recent months has made it almost impossible for everyone to breathe. In recent weeks, prices have been increasing rapidly every day, which is truly shocking and makes everyone live in constant anxiety. In the end, can this vicious cycle of currency inflation and price increases still be curbed? Can price fluctuations still be stabilized? Our reporter specifically and widely interviewed leaders from all sectors and industry leaders in this city, and summarized their opinions below, hoping to provide an accurate and effective diagnosis of the current price surge.</p>
<p>City Council Speaker Pan analyzed that there are three reasons for the current high prices: (1) Currency inflation is an undeniable fact. However, if we use the pre-war period as a standard, the increase in currency issuance has still not exceeded the rate of price increases. Therefore, the true meaning of so-called currency inflation lies in the shrinking area of currency use and the accelerated circulation speed, which leads to high prices. (2) The general increase in interest rates is also mutually causal with price fluctuations. The business community is affected by high interest rates, which leads to increased costs, and ultimately they have no choice but to increase the prices of their products. (3) Monthly adjustments to the cost of living index also make prices echo each other before and after, creating a mutual cycle. Pan believes that the price problem is a part of the entire economic problem. The central government should urgently establish a national general institution to be responsible for management, and cannot simply allow local governments to handle it alone. Because the management of price matters, if it lacks a comprehensive plan and only starts from trivial matters, it will not only fail to achieve the effect of suppression and stabilization, but will also increase stimulation and create a vicious cycle of one after another. He also cited the results of yesterday's warehouse inspection review meeting, explaining that this method can certainly help to temporarily suppress the price of goods, but if Shanghai strictly inspects warehouses, other goods from other places will not dare to be transported here at all. For example, recently, the news that rice from Jiashan, Jiaxing, and Songjiang areas has been diverted to Wuxi for hoarding. In the future, there is also the possibility that the rice stored in this city will flow to other places. Therefore, the warehouse inspection method seems very appropriate on the surface, but in reality, it may still not be helpful for price stability.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan believes that the government urgently needs to set a complete method to suppress prices and implement it comprehensively, otherwise, limiting it to a local area is just like robbing Peter to pay Paul. For example, on the one hand, it opens up provincial exchange, and on the other hand, it prohibits carrying more than two hundred million in cash into the country. The municipal authorities once talked about inspecting the check stubs of various banks and firms, but it has never been implemented. There was news that the melting and selling of gold bars was being thoroughly investigated, but the truth has not been announced. The central government once planned to investigate the hoarding of rice in Wuxi, but there has been no movement at all. How much did the rice price fluctuate from the opening to the closing of the City Council? But the relevant departments have never been seen to have any practical and effective methods. All of this is enough to prove that the government should first have a method for all measures to stabilize prices, and then seek to gain the trust of the people, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation between superiors and subordinates.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange: No Need to Close</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent rumors that the government will close the Securities Exchange, Pan added that this measure by the government may be considered an emergency measure taken because of the abundance of floating capital, but the excess of floating capital is due to the failure to fully introduce it into the production industry due to security, transportation, and other factors after the increase in currency issuance. He believes that the exchange trading of national bonds and industrial and commercial stocks can indirectly absorb floating capital for the production industry. The circulation of stocks on the market can arouse the investment interest of those with floating capital, and those engaged in production can also use this to absorb floating capital. There is no need to close it. Some people think that operating the exchange is speculative in nature. Even if this statement is correct, this kind of speculation is far more beneficial to people's livelihood than manipulating daily necessities. Therefore, it can be asserted that if the exchange is closed, a large amount of floating capital will inevitably turn to hoarding daily necessities, and the rise in prices will be even more predictable. Pan believes that all methods to deal with prices are easier said than done, it is difficult to implement them, and it is even more difficult to clean up the situation. Therefore, at the beginning of implementation, we must consider the actual consequences of the method in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Punishing Speculation: Should Seek Thoroughness</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing said that the effective way to suppress prices at present is to use all efforts to crack down on illegal merchants. For example, the authorities will soon implement the inspection of warehouses and punish the leading speculators in various industries. It is hoped that this work can be done thoroughly, and special attention should be paid to not disturb legitimate industry and commerce for a long time in the execution procedures. He believes that only in this way can good merchants play an exemplary role, and unscrupulous merchants will know where to restrain themselves.</p>
<p>Should Reform the Monetary System: Support Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Liu Jingji, the Standing Director of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, said: To solve the problem of materials, the government should try to reform the monetary system, stabilize the value of the currency, and at the same time, truly try to support industry and commerce, so that floating capital naturally flows to the production path. Otherwise, the endless surge in prices will not only cause disasters to the national economy and people's livelihood, but also Shanghai's legitimate industry and commerce will declare bankruptcy. Liu also said: In my personal opinion, to stabilize prices, we must start from increasing production and materials. To stabilize the value of the currency, we must start from encouraging exports to earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Exchange Business: Scope Should be Expanded</p>
<p>Wang Naixu, the Director of the Brokerage Association, believes that the excessive amount of floating capital on the market without a suitable place to go is the biggest factor in rising prices, and the exchange is the most ideal place to collect floating capital. If we want to ease the price increase, we must find ways to expand the scope of the exchange business.</p>
<p>Rice Prices in Production Areas: Should be Suppressed First</p>
<p>Qu Zhenhua, the Standing Director of the Rice Business, said: Limiting rice prices locally makes it easy for production areas and sales areas to form a reverse flow, which affects the source. It seems appropriate to suppress prices from the production area to seek a fundamental solution, while dredging the grain source, reducing freight and costs, strictly prohibiting speculation, and investigating the hoarding of wealthy families are all important measures to treat the symptoms.</p>
<h3>Dumping Policy Deserves Review: To Protect the Lives of the General Poor, We Should Seek to Expand the Types of Rationing</h3>
<p>Legislator Xi Yushu said that the price problem is a national problem, and it is interconnected and should be dealt with comprehensively. Before the war, farmers could exchange one dan of rice for two bolts of cloth. Now, high-quality fine cloth has reached 40 million. If rice is sold at the limited price, one dan of rice can only be exchanged for half a bolt of cloth, and the livelihood of farmers will become a problem. Taking coal prices as an example, the Fuel Management Committee pointed out that the reason for the price increase is the high transportation cost, but after the price increase, the transportation cost will inevitably be even higher. In addition, the cost of living index and prices are also mutually causal. All of this shows that all economic factors are closely related. Today's price problem is actually a currency value problem, which is directly related to the government's issuance. In the past 50 days, the black market for daily necessities and gold bills has increased five times. Speculators who disregard social interests are indeed hateful, but the competent authorities still lack a comprehensive policy to stabilize prices. At present, the interest rates stipulated by the Central Bank and the interest on treasury bills are close to 30%. Since the implementation of exchange settlement certificates, although the Central Bank has secretly dumped them, the number of times they have risen is also considerable. All of these are indicators of prices. At the same time, the government's policy of handling and controlling materials is also worth reviewing. The current dumping policy cannot make these materials directly reach the hands of ordinary people, but instead allows middlemen to take advantage of the opportunity. Today's rice rationing system has been implemented effectively, and we should find ways to expand its types so that even if prices fluctuate, the lives of the poor can still be minimally guaranteed.</p>
<h3>To Control Prices: We Must Control Materials</h3>
<p>Shui Xiangyun, the Chairman of the General Labor Union, said: To stabilize prices: First, it should be implemented nationwide across the board. Applying pressure in Shanghai alone is useless. (1) We should use economic methods to solve economic problems. The government itself must control materials, so as to cooperate with politics and military affairs to control prices. (2) If there are indeed man-made factors in the price problem, the government should consider "borrowing heads" and "performing surgery," then it must kill a few "tigers" from top to bottom to see. In addition, the government itself should set an example, and civil servants must not do business.</p>
<p>Freeze Issuance: Contract the Currency</p>
<p>Tian Hezheng, the Secretary-General of the Industrial Association, said: In the current situation, everyone has no confidence in the legal currency. As soon as they get it, they immediately use it up. This increases the turnover rate of the currency and promotes the cyclical rise in prices. Therefore, the government should quickly win back the hearts of the people. First, it should freeze issuance, and second, use US aid to dump materials to contract the currency. As for checking warehouses and borrowing heads, these are not fundamental solutions.</p>
<h3>Pan Shihao Hopes for US Aid</h3>
<p>Pan Shihao, a leader in the copying industry, advocated that the Securities Exchange should resume delivery to allow floating capital to go there. He also advocated that the rate and trend of currency flowing to the military for the war effort be tracked and that the government monitor the velocity and direction of the returning flows of these funds into material goods and to gauge the demand for materials. Pan also said: US aid is coming soon, and the war situation in the Central Plains is also improving. If public utilities and state-owned enterprises can be patient, and the cyclical stimulation of the cost of living index and commodity prices can be eased, the price surge can be reduced.</p>
<h3>Opinions of British Business Leaders</h3>
<p>Arnold, the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, said: Generally speaking, to control domestic prices below the world price level, I personally believe that it is not effective. For example, taking the rationed rice price as an example, calculated according to the black market exchange rate, it is only equivalent to one-quarter of the world rice price level. Even at the official exchange rate, it is only equivalent to half of the world rice price level. Ignoring these facts, everything is in vain. The rationing system is reasonable, but the food subsidy system is useless and will lead to abuses because the government cannot balance the budget. At the same time, prohibiting the import of consumer goods that do not even require exchange settlement will inevitably force prices in this city to rise. In addition, foreign stock trading is also a reasonable way out for floating capital, but now the consideration is not thorough, and this type of transaction is also prohibited, so that this part of the floating capital is transferred to commodities, and how can prices not rise?</p>
<h3>Rice Hoarders Fled to Wuxi: The Mayor Telephoned the Executive Yuan Again to Request a Thorough Investigation: The Ministry of Food has Sent Personnel to Zhenjiang and Wuxi to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Since this city stepped up its crackdown on hoarding rice, hoarders have fled to Wuxi. Even the rice from Jiaxing and Xiashi, which was originally transported to Shanghai, is now being transported directly from there to Wuxi by train, which can be proven by the Railway Bureau. Mayor Wu telegraphed President Weng yesterday to request a thorough investigation. In addition, the rice and grain hoarded in Wuxi are mostly under the name of tax grain. It is hoped that the Ministry of Food will be ordered to send senior officials to Wuxi immediately to supervise the local government, thoroughly investigate warehouses, investigate hoarders, and even if it is tax grain, it can be put up for sale to stabilize grain prices.</p>
<p>[Our Own Report from Zhenjiang, 13th] He Yushu of the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Office said: The Wuxi rice and grain market is sluggish. Before the war, there were often 3 million dan of grain circulating in Wuxi, but now there are only hundreds of thousands of dan. Regarding Mayor Wu of Shanghai's telegram to President Weng proposing to purchase a large amount in Wuxi. President Weng and Minister Guan are very concerned about stabilizing grain prices and have sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi to investigate.</p>
<p>[Our Own Report from Wuxi, 12th] Because of rumors that there were large amounts of rice, paddy, and flour hoarded in this county, the Ministry of Food sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi to conduct investigations with the Grain Storage Association and other industry associations this morning.

<h3>West Railway Station Murder Case: Inspection Caused Misunderstanding: Dispatch Soldier Shot Dead</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] At about 11:40 am yesterday, on the railway platform of the Shanghai West Station on Changning Road in West Shanghai, Li Zhihua, a dispatch soldier from the 169th Brigade Headquarters of the 64th Division in Qingdao, and three logistics soldiers, Hu Yong and Zhu Guangpu, were walking along the road to the northern countryside when Sun Liansheng, the squad leader of the first squadron of the third brigade of the first corps of the traffic police corps, led two team members on patrol and suspected them of being deserters. They ordered them to stop and searched them, but Li refused to be inspected and had an argument on the spot. Li immediately took out a grenade from behind. When Sun Liansheng saw that he intended to throw a grenade, he immediately fired two shots with a carbine, hitting Li in the back, penetrating his chest, and killing him on the spot. Upon hearing the alarm, the Changning Police Branch immediately ordered Zhao Xiruo, a detective from the Criminal Investigation Unit, Xu Zhengting, a police chief, and Zhang Yuner, a police officer, to rush to the scene to investigate. They reported to the Photography Unit of the Criminal Investigation Division of the General Bureau to take photos. Later, Xu Xiaohua, the Captain of the First Garrison Brigade of the Garrison Department, interrogated them at the Traffic Police Headquarters together with the head of the military police. According to Hu Yong and Zhu Guangpu, they arrived in Shanghai by the Huahai ship from Qingdao and landed at the Huangpu Wharf.

According to Sun Liansheng, the traffic police squad leader who caused the incident, I took two brothers to patrol along the railway, from north to south. When I was 60 meters away from the West Station, I found three soldiers walking out from the barbed wire fence next to the station. I suspected them of being deserters. Because they refused to be inspected and intended to throw a grenade, for self-defense, I fired a shot, and so on. As a result of the interrogation, the squad leader who caused the incident and the other two traffic policemen, together with the logistics soldiers Hu Yong and Zhu Guangpu, were taken to the Garrison Department for interrogation and review.</p>

<h3>Western Film Stalemate Resolved: Cinemas Accept Western Merchants' Conditions: New Films Will be Released in Succession Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The dispute over the suspension of new films by Western film merchants in this city has been officially resolved after the first-run cinemas adjusted ticket prices again last Saturday to three levels: 500,000, 700,000, and 900,000. The Western film merchants stated that they are not absolutely satisfied with the above prices, especially the price-limited film tickets of 200,000. They still insist that the base number of five jiao should be multiplied by the cost of living index of employees and adjusted dynamically at any time. For example, the current price-limited should be 280,000, but this request has been rejected by the Social Bureau. Therefore, Western film merchants have issued a statement to the cinema industry again that if there are special high-quality new films, the cinema that screens them must temporarily increase the selling price according to the contract to make up for the losses of price-limited tickets. For example, the highest ticket price for the new film "Water Lotus Princess" in the next period of the Grand China Cinema may be more than 1 million. It is heard that the cinema industry has fully accepted the conditions proposed by the Western film merchants, so the new Western films that film fans in this city have been waiting for for a long time will be released successively starting this week. The first new films to appear in the next period are "The Blue Sky" in the Grand Guangming Cathay, and "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles" in the Nanjing Meiqi.</p>

The following revisions were adopted based on the original text (the full text will be published in this newspaper on the 10th):</p>
<p>Exchange Old Warehouse Receipts Before Mid-August Except for Daily Necessities</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, in order to effectively crack down on hoarding, regulate surpluses and shortages, and thereby stabilize market prices, specifically handles the inspection of daily necessities stored in various warehouses in accordance with Article 16 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the inspection of the warehouses (storage facilities) of members of the Shanghai Warehouse Commercial Guild, the warehouses (storage facilities) affiliated with members of commercial guilds such as banking, trust, and docks, and the warehouses affiliated with various shipping companies and railway bureaus, the method is as follows:</p>
<p>A. Deadline for exchanging customer signature cards and existing warehouse receipts: (1) Warehouses (storage facilities) should notify each customer to exchange the old warehouse receipts issued previously for new warehouse receipts before the end of July. These new warehouse receipts must indicate the name of the stored goods, quantity, name of the depositor, name of the company or firm, business license, commercial registration certificate number, and address, and must retain a signature. When goods are released, in addition to returning the warehouse receipt, the signature must also be verified. Furthermore, the term "allegedly" must not be used on warehouse receipts from now on. Customers should also be notified that new warehouse receipts for daily necessities must be exchanged before the end of July, and new warehouse receipts for other items must be exchanged before mid-August. (2) After the warehouse receipts are exchanged as described above, the warehouse (storage facility) should stamp the returned warehouse receipts with a rubber stamp bearing the words "New receipt exchanged, this document is void" and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. For those who fail to exchange within the deadline, each warehouse (storage facility) should list the warehouse receipt number, name of the stored goods, quantity, storage date, name of the owner, address, and other items, and report them to the Social Affairs Bureau through the Warehouse Commercial Guild or the relevant banking, trust, or dock commercial guild for verification. (3) After the Social Affairs Bureau compiles the reports mentioned above, if they concern daily necessities, the Social Affairs Bureau may report to the Municipal Government to entrust various markets to sell the stored goods and may deposit the proceeds of the sale in a national bank under the original name. Each owner may submit supporting documents to the Municipal Government at any time, and after verification, the deposit will be returned. If the goods are not daily necessities, the Municipal Government will report to the Central Government for handling. (4) After the promulgation of these measures, each warehouse (storage facility) should uniformly stipulate the method for issuing warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>Report the Entry and Exit of Designated Goods to the Guild in Monthly Lists</p>
<p>B. Strictly enforce cargo source registration and dynamic reporting: (1) The total amount of designated goods stored in warehouses (storage facilities) throughout the city should first be compiled and reported by the relevant guild to the Social Affairs Bureau within a specified period. Subsequently, when goods enter the warehouse, each customer should register the source of the designated goods in detail. If the source is unknown or the registration is refused, the warehouse (storage facility) should report to the government immediately after storing the goods. (2) Each warehouse (storage facility) should report the entry and exit of designated goods on a daily basis to the trade association in list form, which will be forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. The format of the aforementioned weekly report will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau. (3) When the ownership of designated goods on a warehouse receipt is transferred and the transfer procedure is carried out, the old and new customers should jointly submit a transfer application to the warehouse (storage facility) for filing. The warehouse should include the transfer information in the aforementioned weekly report for inspection. (4) When a customer withdraws stored designated goods, they should submit a withdrawal application form. The form should state the purpose of the withdrawal, and if the goods are being transferred, it should also state the buyer and their address, and be submitted to the warehouse (storage facility) for filing. Each warehouse (storage facility) should also include the withdrawal information in the aforementioned monthly report for inspection. The aforementioned application form should be stamped with a seal containing a registered signature; otherwise, the warehouse (storage facility) may refuse the withdrawal. The format of the application form will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau. (5) Each warehouse (storage facility) must not store goods for which signature cards have not been registered or registration has not been completed.</p>
<p>C. Unified Investigation and Handling: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau will compile monthly statistics on the total amount of designated goods stored throughout the city based on the monthly reports from each warehouse (storage facility) and forward them to the Municipal Government for verification. Any failure to report within the deadline (within the first ten days of the following month) will be immediately reported to the Municipal Government for sealing. The Social Affairs Bureau will then, together with relevant agencies and trade associations, dispatch personnel to inspect and handle the situation. (2) Any goods found without registered signature cards or unregistered or unrecorded will be considered hoarding and profiteering, and the warehouse (storage facility) will be subject to the appropriate punishment. (3) Merchants engaged in the relevant business, if they store designated goods for more than three months without a special reason, the Social Affairs Bureau may order them to sell them on the market. If this is not feasible, the market may be entrusted to sell them, and the proceeds of the sale will still be handed over to the owner. (4) If non-industry personnel or merchants not engaged in the relevant business hoard designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau will report to the Municipal Government for approval and entrust the market to sell them. In addition to fines, the case will also be sent to the court for handling. (5) When merchants in the relevant industry hoard large quantities of designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau may, based on the needs of the market, order them to sell some or all of them on the market. If they fail to comply, the Social Affairs Bureau may, with the approval of the Municipal Government, sell them on their behalf. The term "large quantity" refers to one-fourth of the annual sales for kerosene, newsprint, and coarse-edged paper, and is otherwise handled in accordance with the Implementation Notes of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times. (The measures are attached separately.)</p>
<p>Warehouse Business Operators Must Join the Guild Before the 20th</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the inspection of warehouses (storage facilities) of various import and export merchants in the city, the method is as follows: A.

B. Each importer should report the quantity of designated goods, import date, and location of the storage warehouse (storage facility) to the relevant trade association in list form on a monthly basis, which will be compiled and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for inspection. C. After receiving the aforementioned notice and report form, the Social Affairs Bureau will carefully verify them against the warehouse monthly reports. If there are any questions, they will be investigated to prevent concealment. D. The format of the aforementioned report form will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the inspection of self-provided warehouses (storage facilities) in the city, the method is as follows: A. The location of the warehouses established by each company, factory, and business, and the quantity and purchase date of the existing designated goods, will be publicly announced by the Social Affairs Bureau. The inventory on July 25th will be used as the standard, and a report must be submitted to the relevant trade association for compilation and verification before the end of July. B. Those who fail to report after the deadline will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering once it is discovered that they have violated Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times and Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures. C. The self-provided warehouses (storage facilities) of companies, factories, and businesses must not store the following items. Violators will be deemed to be hoarding: Goods belonging to others, materials that are not sales products or manufactured products of the business. D. Citizens may report companies, factories, businesses, or individuals who have set up warehouses (storage facilities) to store goods but conceal them. If it is discovered that they have violated Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times and Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, they will be rewarded in accordance with Article 21 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the crackdown on other privately established warehouses (storage facilities), the method is as follows: A. Those engaged in the warehouse (storage facility) business who have not yet complied with the Shanghai Municipal Regulations for the Management of Private Warehouse Businesses and obtained a registration license will be strictly cracked down on. B. Those engaged in the warehouse (storage facility) business who have obtained the aforementioned registration license but have not yet joined the Warehouse Commercial Guild as members in accordance with the law must join the guild before July 20th. Those who still fail to join the guild after the deadline will be subject to a suspension of business and will still be ordered to join the guild. If they continue to resist and fail to join the guild, the Social Affairs Bureau may send a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau to revoke their registration license and order them to cease operations. C. If citizens report that the designated goods stored in the above two types of warehouses (storage facilities) violate Articles 11 and 4 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times and Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, they will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering, and rewards will be given as usual.</p>
<p>(6) (Note): A. When implementing the inspection, the Social Affairs Bureau may invite relevant agencies and trade associations to cooperate in the handling. B. All matters related to the investigation of hoarding and profiteering and the implementation of limited-time sales (entrusting the market to sell) will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times. C. These key points will be implemented after being approved and promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the same applies to revisions.</p>

<h3>District Chief Humiliated While Mediating Dispute</h3>
<p>Residents of Caojiadu, Changning District, Zhu Zishan, Cai Maosheng, and others previously suffered a fire. Afterwards, they made every effort to repair the damage in order to have a place to live. However, the Public Works Bureau learned of this and sent employees to forcibly demolish it on the 12th because they had not obtained a permit.

<h3>College Student Sues Own Father, Requests Joint Living and Payment of Educational Expenses; Trial Opens Yesterday, Both Parties Absent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A student from Great China University, Ming Wanhui, has filed a lawsuit with the District Court against her biological father, requesting a judgment ordering: (1) The defendant should fulfill his educational obligation to the plaintiff, and both parties should live together from now on, and the defendant should bear the plaintiff's two-year educational expenses; the living expenses borrowed and spent by the plaintiff from May of this year until the date of the two parties living together should be reimbursed by the defendant, (2) A declaration of provisional execution, (3) Litigation costs should be borne by the defendant.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Ming Wanhui, is currently a sophomore in the Economics Department of Great China University. Her mother, Zhu, was the legal wife of the defendant's father, Ming Shiting, and bore three children. The eldest sister is married to Chen for many years, and the second sister, Wanhua, is married to Zhu and was married in April of this year. More than ten years ago, the defendant took Zhang as his wife, and she bore a son. Zhang gradually became arrogant. In January of the 23rd year of the Republic, Zhu passed away, and Zhang treated the plaintiff and the second daughter even more harshly and advocated for separation. As a result, the defendant, Zhang, Zhang's son, and Zhang's sister lived separately from the plaintiff, Wanhua, and three maids. The defendant initially provided the necessary living expenses and educational expenses for the plaintiff, but before Wanhua's marriage in April of this year, the defendant invited relatives and friends and allocated 1,000 mu of farmland in the native place as marriage expenses for the plaintiff and Wanhua. Unexpectedly, the defendant then refused to pay living expenses from May onwards, claiming that the land allocated by the defendant was all in the communist area of northern Jiangsu and had no income, and a painted cake could not satisfy hunger. The plaintiff repeatedly pleaded with the defendant, but the defendant, listening to Zhang's slander, ignored her. He also stated that he would no longer bear the plaintiff's college education expenses for the remaining two years. Although relatives and friends were asked to persuade him, the defendant still did not consider it. The plaintiff borrowed money to make ends meet, but it has become difficult to continue. The plaintiff then asked a lawyer to write to the defendant for negotiation, but it was ineffective. The plaintiff believes that parents have an obligation to educate their children, and she is still a minor. Therefore, in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, she asked her sister, Wanhua, to be her legal representative and filed a lawsuit. Judge Huang Wenlan of the District Court opened the court yesterday, but both parties were absent. Judge Huang hopes that the two parties will reconcile outside of court.</p>

<h3>The First Person in the Country to Donate a Huge Sum for National Relief: Zhang Xiangchu, a Respected Elder of Shaanxi</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhang Xianzhou</p>
<p>[Report from Xi'an, Shaanxi by this newspaper's airmail] In Shaanxi, almost everyone knows Mr. Zhang Xiangchu. Whether old or young, when they mention this old gentleman, they are affectionate and respectful, and some even heroize him in their speech. Indeed, a person's life and career, if connected with the public, will naturally be respected by people. Mr. Zhang's main achievement was overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's local government in Shaanxi, which influenced the Wuchang Uprising and liberated Shaanxi from the chains of autocracy and incompetence. As a revolutionary leader, an elder, and a gentleman, he has always been respected here.</p>
<p>Half a Lifetime of Toil, Quiet in Old Age</p>
<p>For the past ten years or so, he seems to have grown tired of his official career, half a lifetime of toil, and a body of fatigue. So, he retired to his hometown, quietly spending his twilight years. Sometimes, he would still come out to attend some official social engagements, but these were considered "idle" affairs in his life. As for "serious" matters, he seemed never to talk about them. In his own words, he only acted as a "cheerleader," meaning he only observed from the sidelines, not participating directly. He would clap and cheer when he saw something good or a lively event.</p>
<p>His humorous content, paired with a humorous tone, always made people laugh. He was proficient in Qinqiang opera, Peking opera, and local Shaanxi tunes. He was also skilled in all roles: male, clown, painted face, and female. Therefore, some people said that as long as Elder Zhang was present, any opera could be staged, and he could fill any missing role. Some people considered his actions a "symbol of frustration," but his own explanation was, "I love this stuff."</p>
<p>Generously Donating Family Property</p>
<p>Two months ago, when the national special relief donation was launched, Zhang Xiangchu was the first to donate his ancestral house, valued at about 2 billion, to the country, telegraphing the President to express his patriotic zeal. This act of his was applauded by everyone. Especially when those with even more money were unwilling to contribute a single cent, constantly lamenting their poverty, this old man generously donated, being the first to hand over his family property. This kind of magnanimous spirit can indeed shame and make jealous those wealthy misers. When the reporter chatted with him casually, he said, "I don't seek fame or profit, and I'm afraid of standing out. Handing over my ancestral property is just my duty."</p>
<p>Discussing the Current Situation, Witty Remarks Like Pearls</p>
<p>When talking about the current situation, he was even more witty, making people burst into laughter. His tone of speech was standard Chang'an dialect: "Now it's summer, and the communists are like flies, buzzing around in a chaotic manner. But this is fate. When winter comes, you won't be able to find a single one of them. There won't even be anyone to see." Then he added, "We are now protecting our homes and villages. People always love their hometowns. As the saying goes, 'It's hard to forget the homeland.' It's fine for the Americans, but we don't love them. We won't donate money to them, because that's a different thing. We can't love them, and they don't want us to love them. Nanjing and Shanghai, the Jiangnan heartland, are not bad either, but we don't miss them. Why? Because they have nothing to do with us. No acquaintances, no personal belongings, no ancestral graves. No matter how good they are, it's none of our business. Look at the northern mountains of Shaanxi (i.e., northern Shaanxi), a piece of yellow earth, with poor mountains and barren land, but we always linger reluctantly, because that's ours! Relatives, friends, and fellow villagers are all connected there. You say it's barren, but it's ours. You say other places are better, but that's other people's. So, people from the northern mountains always say the northern mountains are good."</p>
<p>Using Wealth to Develop Oneself is Called Benevolence</p>
<p>"The benevolent use wealth to develop themselves, while the unbenevolent use themselves to gain wealth!" In Mr. Zhang's eyes, there are only these two kinds of wealthy people. The "benevolent" often use money to do good deeds, achieving success and fame, and money brings them honor. The "unbenevolent" don't even want their lives when it comes to making money. If they lose their lives, what good is the money?</p>
<p>So, at this time, everyone should take out their money, whether earned or inherited from ancestors. Donate according to your means. Money and life are directly proportional. If someone can donate 1 billion, then their life is worth several billions. If someone can donate hundreds of billions or trillions, then their worth must exceed hundreds of billions or trillions.</p>
<p>"As the saying goes, 'As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood.' As long as people are there, if they could make money in the past, can make money now, and will be able to make money in the future. Money is an external thing, it goes away and comes back."</p>
<p>The Battle of Kaifeng, Full of Emotion</p>
<p>The Battle of Kaifeng is nothing less than a warning to the wealthy. If they don't contribute a single cent in peacetime, it will be too late when the flames of war reach their heels. Mr. Zhang said with great emotion about this matter: "In the Battle of Kaifeng, the plates, bowls, tables, and chairs that were destroyed can be counted. If you count them carefully, it's only a few billion. What cannot be estimated is 'life,' because the lives of the dead cannot be calculated. If the wealthy don't take out their money, those people are truly seeking their own death!"</p>
<p>Currently, the number of donors for special relief donations across the country is still very few. We are reporting on this "model of humanity" who can take and let go, which should be a good example for the wealthy.</p>
<h3>A Mother Kills Herself Out of Shame for Her Daughter's Immorality: An Unexpected Twist in a Case in Changshu</h3>
<p>[Report from Changshu by this newspaper on the 11th] Caiying, the 21-year-old daughter of Wang Shenglin, a resident of Shenjia Market, is somewhat pretty and has a romantic nature. She has had ambiguous relationships with Zhu Genbao and Xu Fuxing, among others. Last week, late at night, Xu Fuxing and others gathered a crowd to reason with her. Genbao and Caiying immediately jumped out of the window to escape. Genbao drowned in the river because he couldn't swim. The court is currently investigating the matter. Unexpectedly, Caiying's mother, Wang Yin, felt ashamed because her daughter had disgraced the family and caused a death. Unable to face anyone, she hanged herself in her room on the evening of the 10th. Her husband, Shenglin, discovered her, but she had already died. He reported it to the District Prosecutor's Office, which sent personnel to examine the body.</p>
<h3>The Case of Yang Shijie's Escape: The Original Guarantor, Cao Quanxing, Summoned for Interrogation, Ordered to Deliver the Case Within Three Days</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office Pursues the Fugitive Zhou Jiucheng</p>
<p>[Report from outside Suzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] In the case of Yang Shijie's escape, the former magistrate of the puppet Songjiang County, the Wujiang District Prosecutor's Office today interrogated Cao Gengsheng, a court clerk who misappropriated the High Court's seal.

Furthermore, the Criminal Court of the Jiangsu High Court today suddenly received a guarantee for Yang stating that the Senchang Hotel and Yixiangyuan Confectionery in Suzhou's Gong Lane had submitted a written guarantee, promising that he would be available whenever summoned. Based on the guarantee, the High Court immediately ordered the police to summon Cao Quanxing, the manager of Senchang, for questioning, ordering him to deliver Yang within three days and releasing him on bail. In addition, Zhou Jiucheng, the bailiff who perverted the law in this case, abandoned his post and fled on the 10th. The Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office has dispatched personnel to pursue him.</p>

<h3>Human Dyke to Save a Breach: Zhenjiang Gaoqiao District, Wind Shifts, River Tide Recedes</h3>
<p>[Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper on the 11th] Since the typhoon struck on the 6th of this month, many houses have been destroyed in the Lotus Pond area of Gaoqiao District, Zhenjiang. At that time, a section of the riverbank breached, and the people's cries shook the heavens. People rushed to the scene to save it. District, township, and baojia personnel all rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Since there was no burlap or other equipment along the river, they took wood and door panels from the surrounding area to block the breach, but they were immediately washed away. In this extremely dangerous situation, the district chief Chen Dewu and others were struck by inspiration. They told the masses to weave people into a human dike with long ropes, lining them up at the breach to temporarily replace wooden stakes with their bodies. The people on the bank also used all their strength to hold the ends of the ropes, helping this human dike, until 9 p.m. when the wind direction changed, and the river tide receded, preventing the breach from expanding further. After learning of the above situation, the county government has now allocated 10,000 burlap sacks and 5,000 wooden stakes to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province's This Year's Field Tax Quota: Provincial Assembly Urges Collection of One and a Half Borrowings</h3>
<p>[Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper on the 11th] For the 36th year, Jiangsu Province collected one tax and borrowed half. This year's field tax was approved by the Executive Yuan as one and one, that is, 3.03 million shi of grain should be collected for tax and 3.03 million shi should be borrowed. [Further News]: The Provincial Provisional Assembly believes that Jiangsu Province has suffered eight years of war of resistance and three years of communist banditry, with empty houses and little savings among the people. Furthermore, the autonomous expenses of various county townships, the expenses of security schools, the expenses of local teams, the expenses of conscription, and the supply of garrison troops are all funded by taxing fields. The heavy field tax in Jiangnan is the highest in the country. On the 10th, they sent a special telegram to Grain Minister Guan Jiyu, asking to alleviate the people's difficulties and to set the collection quota for the 37th year at one tax and one and a half borrowings, as in the previous year.</p>

After investigation, this was found to be true, so he was prosecuted according to the law.</p>
<h3>Is There No One Wealthy in Hangzhou?</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper on the 11th] In the years since the victory, Hangzhou has always stood in a position of ease and happiness. Nourished by wealthy outsiders, its economic situation has not appeared to decline. Therefore, in today's world of war and chaos, it is truly a "paradise" in name and reality.</p>
<p>But since the government launched the special relief donation campaign, this "paradise" has stirred up some disturbances. The wealthy are planning how to escape the title of "tycoon," and they are going to great lengths, asking people to intercede. Another group of people has lightly set aside the special relief donation.</p>
<p>The Slogan of the Wealthy</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Press Association happened to launch a public vote to elect wealthy people at this time. The Postal Administration sympathized with this righteous act and specially donated a mailbox for free. The wealthy became even more disturbed and shouted the slogan "There are no wealthy people in Hangzhou." The Press Association carried out its original intention and insisted on holding the election. One week before the vote count was about to begin, they borrowed the auditorium of the City Council as the venue for the vote count. At a symposium, one councilor said, "There is fundamentally no one wealthy in Hangzhou." Someone else said, "The Press Association is making a mountain out of a molehill." The more they talked, the more agitated they became. As a result, they said that the Press Association's borrowing of the City Council's auditorium this time did not comply with the regulations. One of their regulations stated that loans could only be made for matters related to citizens. Therefore, they flatly refused.</p>
<p>The City Council Refuses to Lend the Auditorium</p>
<p>Originally, in the minds of the Hangzhou City Councilors, this matter of electing wealthy people was unrelated to the city's citizens, even smaller than the proposal to "prohibit wonton vendors from striking clappers." They believed that electing wealthy people had no effect and no meaning. This refusal aroused the resentment of the Hangzhou press, and they unanimously wrote commentaries criticizing the City Council's inappropriate refusal to lend the auditorium.</p>
<p>When the votes were counted, representatives from the municipal government, the city council, and other agencies were sent. Everyone asked the representative of the City Council why they didn't lend the auditorium. He said that this was not his idea!</p>
<p>When the votes were counted, many people detailed the assets of certain individuals, many people explained the reasons why certain individuals became wealthy, and many people exposed how certain individuals had transformed themselves to become the wealthy people of today. There were a total of more than 4,000 ballots. Many wealthy people were listed. The Press Association sent this information to the government for reference.</p>
<p>The government's method for nominating wealthy people was to have various trade associations nominate them. After repeated discussions and research, the trade associations replied to the government that "there are no wealthy people!" The reporter once asked the government how to resolve this "special relief donation" stalemate. They said, "See what happens in Shanghai, and then we'll decide!"</p>
<p>The Target of the Special Donation</p>
<p>In the past, there were righteous people who "would not lag behind others in loving the country" and heroes who "generously donated their wealth." Now, who exactly are the people the government is protecting? And why are these people unwilling to fulfill their obligations?</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen has sent a document to Hangzhou urging the remittance of the special donation. However, the targets of the special donation in Hangzhou have not yet been found. Whose pockets will these special donations come from?</p>
<p>In the past few days, there has been a campaign in the city of Hangzhou to elect a director of a certain financial institution, with banquets for guests and separate activities. It is truly unknown how much money will be spent. If this money were used for special relief donations, the special relief donations could probably be paid.</p>
<p>Recently, commodity prices in the city of Hangzhou have fluctuated greatly. With a single turn of the hand, a blink of an eye, a phone call, a gesture, the wealthy deal with tens of millions or billions of dollars. If they were to extract some interest from this, the special relief donations would probably not fall through!</p>
<h3>Miniature News</h3>
<p>Wuxi [Report from this newspaper] During the recent typhoon, a batch of rafts transporting wood from Xidi were scattered by the typhoon at the Dantu Estuary of the Yangtze River. Hundreds of workers were quickly hired to salvage them from the river, resulting in very heavy losses, reaching hundreds of billions. It is said that the losses of wood merchants in Changzhou were also large.</p>
<p>Guangfeng [Report from this newspaper] Bandit forces are rampant in the surrounding villages. The county government has requested and been approved by the Jiangxi Provincial Security Commander to dispatch one platoon each of regular troops from Shangrao, Yiyang, Hengfeng, and Guixi counties to assist in the suppression.

<h3>Mayor Accepts Rice Merchants' Request: Rice Price Limit Further Relaxed Yesterday, Off-Exchange Bids Have Broken the 30 Million Mark</h3>
<p>Rice market transactions began on a small scale yesterday, but bids soared, breaking the 30 million mark. At 9 a.m. yesterday, representatives from the North and South Rice Markets, Yin Fuxiang and Hu Wen'an, went to the City Government to request Mayor Wu to relax the price limit to maintain proper business. The mayor then consulted with Executive Yuan President Weng via long-distance telephone, and as a result, it was decided to make a decision based on the rice prices in the production areas. Considering the actual difficulties of the rice merchants in this city, the mayor approved the relaxation of the white japonica rice price limit in the North and South Rice Markets to 28.5 million. The rice merchants expressed to the mayor their willingness to restrain their colleagues and never raise prices for transactions.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Following last week's price surge, rice prices continued to reach new peaks. The average price per shi was about 2 to 3 million higher than last week. Market prices were 28.5 million for medium white japonica rice, and off-exchange bids had broken the 30 million mark, with white japonica rice at 31 million. Arrivals were scarce yesterday, with 2,028 shi arriving at the South Market and 400 shi arriving at the North Market, for a total of only 2,428 shi.</p>
<p>The reasons for the price increase: (1) Grain prices in the Wuxi production area are soaring, and large households in Wuxi and Changzhou are absorbing Shanghai rice, leading to a depletion of sources. (2) The continuous rise in various non-agricultural commodities is stimulating people's minds. (3) Small investors are aggressively buying in, driving up market prices even more.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met with Director Ji of the Social Food Department and asked him if he had any countermeasures. He shook his head repeatedly, saying, "This is not a simple rice price problem. From another perspective, this is not a rise in prices, but a devaluation of legal currency."</p>
<h3>Shantou Grain Soars</h3>
<p>Flour is the only commodity showing a decline, due to the extremely tight money supply. The morning market opened with rice prices rising rapidly. As manufacturers stopped selling, still wanting to struggle, the opening price for old army rice was 9.3 million, but it fell back to 8.9 million in the aftermarket, a soft decline of 150,000. Bingchuan, Jiancheng, and Hongfeng each fell by a small amount of 100,000, and bran was trading at 6.85 million.</p>
<p>The rise in coarse grains was insane. Although the negotiated price of soybeans had been raised by 20%, the limits were 17 million for carob beans and 15 million for broad beans. In the end, carob beans were slightly transacted at 16.8 million and broad beans at 14.9 million. Northern gangs were aggressively buying red beans and corn, with the former rising by 6 million and the latter by 5 million. Sesame rose by 5 million, raw peanuts increased by 7 million, and selected green and white peanuts were raised by 3 to 4 million. Mung beans were marked up by 3 million.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices soared in a straight line and have returned to free trade. Pure raw oil opened at 78 million, locally produced soybean oil traded at 66 million, up 6 million, raw rapeseed oil at 64 million, Jiton jumbo cans at 69 million, and Jiton mini army cans at 74 million, up 4 million. Bean cake customers were actively disposing of it, rising from an opening price of 7.5 million to 7.9 million, and 8.1 million, a surge of 30%.</p>
<h3>Local Business Conditions</h3>
<p>Wuxi [Report from Wuxi by this newspaper on the 12th] Because the source of rice and grain is small and sales are large, market prices were weak at first but then firm. Flour and wheat have rebounded slightly. White japonica rice is 29.84 million, white yuan rice is 29.94 million, yangxian rice is 29.34 million, wheat is 20.5 million, white wheat is 22 million, and cotton yarn is 1.2 billion on the black market.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] Rice prices in Suzhou continued to rise today. The market is trading at 25 million for coarse japonica rice, 26.8 million for secondary white japonica rice, and the negotiated price for secondary white rice for door sales is 27.4 million, up 2.5 million from the previous day.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang [Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper on the 12th] Prices in Zhenjiang continue to climb. High-quality rice is now selling for 29 million, soybean oil is selling for 70 million, and flour is approaching 10 million. In order to suppress the price surge, the Provincial Police Bureau has dispatched officers to arrest illegal merchants. In just a few hours, they uncovered more than ten shops selling on the black market without complying with the negotiated price, and they have all been arrested and sent to the headquarters for questioning.</p>
<p>Jiangyin [Report from Jiangyin by this newspaper on the 12th] Rice prices rose again on the 12th. The association's limited price for medium white japonica rice is 31 million, and the black market price is 32 million. One dou of rice can be exchanged for 100 jin of watermelon, and each silver dollar is worth 2.75 million.</p>
<p>Xi'an [Report from Xi'an by this newspaper on the 12th] Local banking officials estimate that the inflation rate in Xi'an for the first half of the year averaged 2036 percent, while the inflation rate for Fengxiang wine was 1100 percent.</p>
<p>Chengdu [Report from Chengdu by this newspaper on the 12th] Chengdu has been experiencing continuous rain, and grain prices have soared. Rice is 32 million per double shi on the 12th, and cotton yarn and cloth are soaring. The provincial government has decided to announce the names of large grain hoarders and force them to sell, and to begin controlling daily necessities.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares Revolve at High Levels, Market Foresees Across-the-Board Limit Ups</h3>
<p>Hua shares first showed good looks yesterday. In the morning market, they rose high and then retreated, once appearing weak near noon. However, physical goods still had elasticity. Benefiting from the rumor of parallel line bills, the market later rose to the limit and then had premium transactions. The morning market initially continued the momentum of the previous week, opening considerably higher.</p>
<p>Yong Yarn debuted at 9250 yuan. After reaching a new peak of 9300 yuan, it was sold down to 8750 yuan. Nos. 23 and 65 advanced to 8880 yuan. However, both yarn and cloth physical goods showed declines. Large households closed out many holdings, and Nos. 14 and 104 were closed out, falling further to a low price of 8620 yuan. Near noon, sentiment improved, and yarn and cloth rebounded slightly. Nos. 12 and 152 vigorously bought, and the noon closing rose to 8810. Shanghai Cement's new shares also announced a limit up. Matches fell to the limit and then rebounded. Compared to last Saturday, Meiya rose by half, Datong was good by one-tenth, Matches, Li'an, Guohuo, Zhabei, Commerce, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Yonggong fell by half, Zhongsi and Hengfeng by one-tenth, and the rise and fall of the remaining shares were minimal.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn opened at 9200 yuan. Sentiment was excited. Nos. 71 and 169 advanced to the limit up. After this, nineteen shares were at the limit up, and hot stocks had premium transactions. Yong Yarn first added 400 yuan, Xinguang and Jingfu 12 yuan, and Meiya 10 yuan. Later, there were rumors that the National Bank was stepping in, and there was a small retreat to 100 yuan. Finally, with the National Bank exchanging and stepping in considerably, the final transaction was at about a half-board increase. With the exception of Matches, Rongfeng, Lianhua, Commerce, Guohuo, Wuhe, Jingyu, Hengfeng, Huaxin, and Xinyi, which rose by half to one and a half, the rest all hit the limit up. Among off-market stocks, the World and Dasheng stocks rose strongly by more than 20%, while the rest were steady.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday saw a small retreat. Unified C opened at 1.15 million, retreating from 1.26 million to 1.08 million before rebounding slightly. About 4 million was transacted. Compared to last Saturday, A, B, and D were each down 70,000 yuan, C fell 110,000 yuan, and Unified E fell 80,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Changes Overnight Interest</h3>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Surge in Price Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement certificate system, the export industry has been more active than in the past. Export foreign exchange in June reached about 50 million US dollars, setting a record high for the year. It is expected that this month's export volume will not be lower than the previous month. However, the continuous rise in domestic prices is affecting the cost of export goods, indirectly affecting their sales overseas, which is a concern. In terms of overseas remittances, the amount was as low as 900 million yuan in May. After the implementation of the new system in June, it has increased. Currently, the conversion of overseas remittances is based on market prices, with special preferential treatment, and it is expected that there will be an improvement in the future.</p>
<p>Further news: The price of foreign exchange settlement certificates surged yesterday, with the highest bids reaching 3.3 million. The most transactions took place at 3 million, an increase of more than 800,000 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Tightness of Money in Xiamen; Unable to Meet Remittances from Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Our Xiamen dispatch, 11th] A huge amount of remittances from overseas Chinese have recently poured in, but due to the extraordinary tightness of money in the market, various private remittance agencies are unable to cope, causing resentment among the dependents of overseas Chinese and creating a serious situation. Yesterday, under the urging of the municipal government, a portion of the remittances was distributed, but large amounts still cannot be cashed. According to the person in charge of the remittance agencies, overseas remittances to the city in June were about two trillion, all of which were paid. This time, the amount is quite large at three trillion. Although there was 400 billion in floating capital responding to the market yesterday, the difference is still large, and it is hoped that the government can provide assistance to alleviate the current serious situation. Also, after part of the overseas remittances were distributed yesterday, prices rose sharply, especially the US dollar, which sold for 3.6 million per dollar, repeatedly causing market chaos. If all remittances are distributed within days, the inflationary trend will become even more severe.</p>
<h3>Weak Market Sentiment; Supply Exceeds Demand; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices are Falling; Authorities Announce Large-Scale Sale of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Due to the excessive price increases in the cotton yarn market last week, sales were slow, and prices of non-industry materials decreased; furthermore, the fellow traders’ funds became tighter, sellers competed to sell in succession. After the opening, popular yarns were in scant supply, while miscellaneous brands flooded the market, and calling prices rose, resulting in a dull market and a sharp drop in prices. Finally, 42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was heard to have sellers bidding at 1.4 billion, but lacking buyers, the price finally settled at 1.45 billion, down 150 million. 40-count "Ren Zhong" yarn was priced at 1.33 billion. 32-count "Five Color Star" yarn was 1.14 billion, and 21-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1.1 billion, all for delivery the day after tomorrow, but there were no takers. Near closing, due to the decline in the stock market, cotton cloth prices fell sharply, and the prices further declined, ultimately closing down 120 million, with a total of 36 transactions for the day, amounting to 146 pieces.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market yesterday was affected by rumors that the authorities would implement warehouse inspections. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company supplied a large amount of cloth on Saturday, causing funds to tighten, and many were selling at a loss. Outside the market, fine cloth opened at 38.4 million, but the North Gang started dumping, and retail investors followed suit, resulting in oversupply. The market fell rapidly to 34.8 million, before rebounding slightly to 500 million at the close, down more than 10% from the weekend.</p>
<p>"Four Gentlemen" broadcloth fell by 6.05 million yuan as a result of the Textile Construction Company distributing cloth in bulk and the traders reselling it. Outside of small recoveries across other fine cloth grades, "Shilin" cloth, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, raw cloth, "Nafu Tuo" (a type of fabric) and other fabrics continued to be strong, with gains varying from 1 million to 13.5 million.</p>
<p>Another report says that the Textile Construction Company is tendering for the "Football" fine cloth produced by the Nanyang Factory, and the "Double Fish" fine cloth produced by the Wuxi Qingfeng Factory. The price that traders are considering paying is around 32.5 million to 33 million.</p>
<h3>Large Amounts of Yarn and Cloth Not Yet Sold Off</h3>
<p>Another report: Liu Gongyun of the National Bank announced yesterday morning that a large amount of cotton yarn and cloth worth 5 trillion yuan would be sold off, which greatly threatened the market. Yarn and cloth prices fell by about 10%, and market demand was also not very smooth. In the end, the banks only sold yarn and cloth totaling 145 million yuan, and although the China Textile Company was prepared to sell cloth, there was no sales. The China Textile Company, on behalf of the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, sold 129 pieces of yarn on the market, totaling 20,109,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Cash in the Market; Banks Issue Banker's Drafts</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] Yesterday, rumors circulated in the market that the Central Bank would issue fixed-amount banker's drafts. However, according to the responsible authorities of the bank, this is absolutely not the case. However, due to insufficient funds, the city banks were specially allowed to issue a large number of 500,000-yuan banker's drafts for use by government agencies to pay salaries. Moreover, the authorities of the National Bank, in view of the alarming rise in prices in recent days, have decided to implement large-scale sales of goods, hoping to absorb 5 trillion in funds within the next few days in order to tighten the money supply and prevent the sharp rise in prices.</p>
<p>The opinion of the financial community in this city is that with such a rise in prices, there is a general feeling of insufficient funds in the market, and the issuance of large denominations of currency is only a matter of time. However, at present, the public is restless, and the issuance of large denominations of currency will further shake the public's confidence in the legal tender, which will have a great impact on prices. This is the main consideration of the authorities of the National Bank.</p>
<h3>New Method for Paying for Yarn and Cloth Allocations to be Implemented Today</h3>
<p>Regarding the new method for settling payments for various yarn numbers allocated by the China Textile Company, the China Textile Company stipulates that it will be implemented starting today (the 13th). It stipulates that payments made before 12:00 noon on this day can be settled with a bank draft or check. Payments made after that time must be paid in cash sealed by the bank; otherwise, they will not be accepted. It is also strictly stipulated that anyone who has a check returned once will have their allocation eligibility revoked.</p>
<h3>The Work of Purchasing Raw Cotton is Gradually Coming to a Standstill</h3>
<p>Regarding the purchase of raw cotton, the quantity purchased is currently gradually decreasing, and some have even come to a standstill. According to people in the industry, there are many reasons for the decrease in raw cotton purchases, the most important of which are three: (1) The main producing areas, such as Shaanxi Province, have now prohibited external transportation; (2) Secondary producing areas, such as Luoyang, Xiangyang, and Xincheng, have repeatedly suffered damage to transportation, making it almost impossible to repair, and it is also impossible to transport cotton; (3) Cotton farmers in other producing areas have lost faith in the legal tender and will not sell unless they are traded in silver dollars or silver dimes. In fact, the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee cannot purchase a large amount of silver dollars in Shanghai to purchase cotton, and it is also strictly prohibited by government laws. With these three difficulties, the work of purchasing raw cotton can only gradually come to a standstill, and the future of raw cotton supply in this city is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Initially Weak, Then Strong</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market yesterday fell due to government supervision, but finally became strong due to the rise in prices of non-industry materials, resulting in prices similar to those of last Saturday. 120-count "Golden Three Horses" bright silk opened at 1.9 billion yuan, but trading was quiet and prices fell frequently. The spot price at noon closing fell to 1.65 billion yuan, with a premium of 80 million yuan for deferred settlement. The afternoon opening was at 1.88 billion yuan, and the closing fell by a small 20 million yuan. Finally, the off-market price rose again to 1.93 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Silk: The market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, with each grade ending up higher than last Saturday by 23 million yuan. High-grade silk fell to 1.85 billion yuan in the morning with some transactions, and rose to 1.97 billion yuan in the afternoon with transactions. B-grade opened at 2.05 billion yuan. 28-grade serge was still asking for around 1.5 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics: The market fell and then became strong. The largest deferred settlement price for real silk quilt covers was 1.05 billion yuan, and the smallest spot price fell to 880 million yuan, with the spot price at closing at 930 million yuan. Gingham crepe was priced at 3.25 million yuan. In the afternoon, the price of quilt covers off-market was more than 1 billion yuan outside the customs.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Sentiment is Boosted</h3>
<p>Since the fierce inflationary trend struck the city's commodity market last weekend, all goods have fluctuated, and the tea market has also seen improvement. However, the market yesterday showed no changes in the morning. Then, news that grain and other commodities repeatedly reached new highs boosted market sentiment, and those holding onto goods gradually developed the idea of defending them, and asking prices rose rapidly without limit. Prices were extraordinarily brilliant, but transactions were not very strong, as trading involved negotiations.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Kerosene: Asking prices in the kerosene market yesterday were chaotic. It was heard that the limited price for 46-degree barrel oil was 118 million, but cargo owners insisted on 123 million. The asking price for tinned oil was also raised to 16 million.</p>
<p>Coal balls: The limited price was 2.3 million per dan (a unit of weight). Yesterday, due to the rise in raw materials and all commodities, the black market rose, and it was heard that the factory price had also increased to 53.6 million per ton.</p>
<p>Soap: In the soap market, raw material caustic soda rose to the 700 million mark per barrel, resulting in Huang Xiangmao raising the price to 32 million, Gubben to 42 million, Jian Dao to 41 million, and Guanghua soap to 32.3 million.</p>
<p>Timber market: The market price of foreign pine and Liu'an rose sharply due to the large increase in exchange settlement certificates, and the market price has broken through 1 million. The market price of local fir timber was stable yesterday.</p>
<p>The Transportation Control Committee has formulated concrete plans to encourage the export of local products from the South China region and to support the development of export trade, and has submitted them to the relevant authorities for reference.</p>

<h3>Numerous Personnel Adjustments at Taiwan University; More Than 100 Faculty and Staff Terminated; Association Formed to Appeal for Return Travel Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei dispatch, 12th] There have been many personnel adjustments at Taiwan University this semester, with more than 30 professors, more than 30 associate professors, more than 20 assistant teachers, more than 20 lecturers, and more than 10 staff members being terminated, totaling more than 100 people. Among them, those with academic reputation include Xu Xixuan, Director of the History Department, Li Hanying of the College of Science, Zhang Sihan of the Department of Western History, and Qu Zhenren of the Medical College. They believe that, according to Taiwan University's usual practice, the first and second contracts for professors are for a minimum of three years, and the third contract is for life. Moreover, the usual practice of universities is to notify of termination in mid-June and issue all appointment letters by the end of June. Because Taiwan University's issuance of appointment letters was late this time, and no notification was given before the termination period in July, they believe that it is a destruction of university tradition and an unreasonable measure. Therefore, they formed an association and held a reception for reporters this morning to appeal to the press. They claimed that they have no preconceived notions about whether to stay or leave, but because the school suddenly terminated their contracts, they lost the opportunity to prepare. Therefore, they have requested the school to issue four months' salary as return travel expenses. Zhuang Changgong, the new president, has agreed to issue two months' salary as appropriate, depending on the needs, and is continuing to negotiate. In the past few days, they have visited Chairman Wei, Commander Peng, and the Senate to report the truth and have received much sympathy. If the school has no intention of accepting their request, they will proceed in terms of law, society, and public opinion.</p>

<p>School Introduction</p>
<h3>National Wusong Merchant Marine College</h3>
<p>School History: As early as the late Qing Dynasty, the Ministry of Posts and Communications reorganized Shanghai Public School into the Higher Industrial School and set up specialized departments in Railroad, Mine, Civil Engineering, and Navigation Administration. In the third year of the Xuantong era, Director Tang Weizhi established a specialized school by separating the Navigation Administration Department to cultivate shipping talents, naming it the "Ministry of Posts and Communications Higher Merchant Marine School," with Xia Sunpeng as the Dean of Academic Affairs. After the Republic of China, the Wusong school buildings were completed, and Sa Zhenbing was appointed as the President by the Ministry of Communications. It was suspended once in the fourth year of the Republic of China. It was re-established in the 18th year of the Republic of China with a complete scale. The school buildings were completely destroyed in both the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident. In the 28th year of the Republic of China, it was re-established in Chongqing, renamed the "Chongqing Merchant Marine College," and directly under the Ministry of Education. It was suspended again in the 32nd year of the Republic of China and was taken over by Jiaotong University. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education believed that the school was the only place in the country to cultivate shipping talents and had a long history, and should be re-established as soon as possible. Therefore, in February of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, a re-establishment preparatory committee was formed, with Zhou Junshi as the President. The former Lester School at No. 505, East Changzhi Road was rented as a temporary site. It officially opened on October 14, the 35th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Women's Softball League Championship Battle: Lan Deng and the Catholic Union Meet at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Lan Deng team, the incarnation of the Shanghai Women's Softball National Games team, will face the Catholic Union team at the racecourse at 6:00 PM today to compete for the championship of the first cycle of the Women's Softball Senior League. Both teams have been on a winning streak of five games.

In addition, Cheng Mulan, a female pitcher second only to Ma Lianxiu, and Wu Hanlian, a catcher unparalleled in the country, can be said to be as solid as a rock. The outfielders Guo Zhichang, Zhang Luo Luo, and Tang Xiaoxiao are all agile and steady, leaving no flaws. The Catholic Union, on the other hand, gathers the elite foreigners and has been dominating the Shanghai scene for more than a day. Weighing the offense and defense of the two teams, Lan Deng seems to have a slight advantage, but it is difficult to make a judgment on strengths and weaknesses before the battle.

The top three winners in each of the 22 events in the selection trials were selected as athletes. The biggest upset in this selection trial was the failure of high hurdle master Dillard and shot put general Torrance to be selected, as the two had repeatedly broken world records this year. However, Dillard finished third in the 100 meters, but he will not be able to show his talent in the high hurdles at the World Games, which is a pity. According to head coach Cromwell, the United States is certain to win first place in seven to eight of the 22 track and field events at the World Games. The US World Games team is scheduled to depart for Southampton on Wednesday on the America.</p>

<h3>Such Rule of Law!</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The Nuremberg Trials in Germany have long ended, and more than a dozen Nazi culprits, including Goering, have long been executed. However, the execution of such a major case that should have shocked the world was kept strictly secret before and after. Although the trial process was completely open, the indictment described the facts from the legal principles, spanning tens of thousands of words, and the death sentence was also pronounced publicly; however, the execution of the death sentence was kept absolutely secret except for the representatives of the participating countries and a few journalist representatives, and photography was not allowed, nor was the newspaper allowed to have excessively detailed and exaggerated descriptions afterwards. It is said that the reason for this is to prevent this event from being regarded as a "martyrdom" by the remnants of the Nazis; however, the most important point is that the civilized spirit of the West has long forbidden the law to be merely a tool to satisfy "popular sentiment." Because if one only seeks to satisfy popular sentiment, war criminals like Goering could have been "beheaded and displayed" after "parading through the streets" without waiting for a trial, and then "left to rot for three days."</p>
<p>However, looking back at our country's law enforcers, their understanding of the spirit of the rule of law does not seem to have yet broken away from the primitive civilization stages of "parading through the streets" and "beheading and displaying." I have not studied law, and I do not know whether the current legal provisions allow for parading through the streets. However, I remember that not long ago, the authorities were criticized by foreign newspapers for their barbaric act of parading Japanese war criminals through the streets before they were shot, which caused a ban. It is not allowed to parade war criminals who have been sentenced to death and are awaiting execution, which proves that our authorities are still able to respect the civilized spirit of modern rule of law.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city the day before yesterday published photos of two suspected profiteers being paraded through the streets on their way to court. The fact that speculators and profiteers should be severely punished has long been a unanimous opinion, but I believe that apart from a few "spectators in the courtroom," what the general public demands from the law is the guarantee of justice, not just temporary emotional satisfaction. Even if "parading through the streets" is indeed a punishment explicitly stated in the law, it is ultimately not a phenomenon that should exist in a country that is advocating the rule of law to execute it before the crime has been determined. Now these two suspected speculators are out on bail pending trial in court, so even if they are suspected of committing a crime, it is unlikely to be so serious that it requires "executing first and reporting later." In the unlikely event that the court declares them innocent, wouldn't their suffering the punishment of being paraded through the streets add another page of "wrongful imprisonment" to the record of calls for the protection of human rights?</p>
<p>The parading through the streets has just passed, and the calls for "killing one to warn a hundred" and "borrowing a head" have come again. Moreover, some people have even taken up their pens to openly call for "borrowing a head" in newspapers. I really can't believe what kind of society we are in. This can't help but remind me of Robespierre during the French Revolution; however, this cruel politician, who liked to "borrow heads" to gain the applause of the masses, finally ended up on the guillotine that he had created himself. I often hear people say that heavy penalties should be used in times of chaos, but I always doubt its effectiveness.</p>
<p>In today's world, where intellectuals still believe that emotion should drive reason, one cannot help but feel sad for the future of the rule of law in our country. Our current situation may not yet be strictly implementing the rule of law, but unless we have completely lost faith in the progress of human civilization, we should strive for the spirit of the rule of law in the country. In particular, state officials who bear the important responsibility of law enforcement should always carefully exercise their power to avoid infringing on the dignity of the law and inviting ridicule from outsiders.</p>
<p>However, what we are suffering from today is that many people who are responsible for law enforcement still cannot thoroughly understand the essence of the spirit of the rule of law. Such shortcomings can be found in their conversations and official actions at any time. For example, not long ago, a certain party made a statement saying that if anyone is found impersonating a soldier in the future, they will be sent to the front line to serve as soldiers. The meaning is nothing more than saying that since you like to impersonate a soldier, then I will send you to be a soldier. Speaking frankly, this method is naturally the most enjoyable. However, impersonating a soldier is clearly a violation of discipline, and serving as a soldier is an honor in modern countries. To equate crime with honor, isn't it still the misguided notion of "good iron is not used to make needles, good people do not become soldiers" at work? It is not only illegal, but it also inadvertently damages the reputation of the military!</p>
<p>Furthermore, taking the "monk's haircut" as a means of punishment is also exceeding the bounds of the rule of law. What kind of people are dancing hall managers, I think readers know more details than I do. Of course, "taking advantage" and exploiting dancers violate police regulations, but what does the "monk's haircut" have to do with crime? Perhaps because male prisoners in prison all have "monk's haircuts," it has become a symbol of criminals. However, this explanation is ultimately far-fetched. The reason why prisoners have "monk's haircuts" is probably only to save time and money; it seems that the New Life Movement also advocated cleanliness, including hair, and among the important government officials today, there are many who have monk's haircuts, especially soldiers. Therefore, the monk's haircut should never be used as a symbol of punishment. And now someone actually thinks so, acts so, isn't that a strange thing?</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that the law is dead, and people are alive. The dead provisions should be interpreted by living people, but the greatest danger is precisely this kind of specious misinterpretation. The provisions will not open their mouths and require people to interpret them, but the white paper and black letters still have a scope to follow. If everyone can arbitrarily turn it into power according to their own fantasies and convenience and impose it on others, then why do we need laws, court organs at all levels, and the case law interpretation of the Supreme Court? Moreover, the examples listed above completely ignore the law and cannot be said to be interpreting the law. If my judgment is not wrong, then it can only be said that feudal consciousness is at work, and the psychology of the "courtroom audience" and the consciousness of "satisfying popular sentiment" are at work. However, this kind of consciousness is precisely an obstacle to the spirit of the rule of law!</p>
<h3>Visiting the Science Exhibition of Various Middle Schools</h3>
<p>— Suobei</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, we had already shouted "Mr. Science," but thirty years later, Mr. Science has not yet arrived. What the Chinese people lack most today is the basic common sense of elementary school students in some civilized countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, this science exhibition of various middle schools in Shanghai is more for the people than for the students. On the second day of the opening of the exhibition, I stepped into the first venue (inside Gezhi Middle School) and found that the many interesting science performances and displays and explanations of scientific specimens and instruments attracted many ordinary people, which could not help but make me secretly happy. Today, someone is doing science knowledge publicity, and this publicity is really the cleanest and most valuable of all "publicity" in the world.</p>
<p>Many schools' exhibits are displayed here, each containing endless knowledge. The most complete exhibits and the most exquisite and beautiful arrangement belong to Jiliang Middle School (formerly Nie Zhongcheng Huatong Public School). A total of three classrooms are displayed, with specimens, teaching aids, and collections made by teachers and students in the fields of animals, plants, minerals, and physics and chemistry, numbering no less than thousands. This is impossible for schools with shorter histories, because collection takes time and money. I most appreciate the insect life history, human fire acquisition history, and large contingents of various pests that they have compiled, which can make people who have been away from school for a long time review their past lessons. When I bid farewell to the Jiliang exhibition room, a biology teacher was holding a human skull and explaining why hitting the temples is most likely to be fatal, and many people were listening with their eyes wide open.</p>
<p>The exhibits of the Dade Midwifery School also make people stop and not want to leave, especially the active pregnancy model, which tells people common sense that should not be ignored, but under the concept of old morality, many people cannot understand this common sense very well. Many monsters, such as children without skulls and exposed brains, are creepy. In addition, the publicity of the dangers of old-fashioned midwifery and the specimens of diseases of children and pregnant women are all of profound significance.</p>
<p>Entering the exhibition room of Gezhi Middle School again, an electric car is being demonstrated inside. The eruption of a volcano is also surrounded by many people. Especially the model of a radio-controlled aircraft makes me reluctant to leave. The principle of this thing is very simple, but in China, where common sense is lacking, many people find the "driverless aircraft" too mysterious.</p>
<p>The exhibition is successful, but what makes me doubt is: I have not yet found that any school's teaching material specimens contain anything about atomic energy and atomic bombs, even simple diagrams are lacking. Is it that this major common sense of the 20th century has not yet been mentioned in the homework of middle school students?</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Hams</p>
<p>The US Post Office announced that there are still money orders worth US$32 million that have not been cashed. These money orders have been in the office for more than a year, and the oldest one was issued in 1863.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the American Keli'an Weekly, there are a total of 8,000 people in the United States with assets of more than one million US dollars, of which 4,475 live in six states: California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Shanghai, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h3>Philately</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, stamp collecting is also an investment. According to statistics from "Newsweek," several types of American stamps have increased in value by 8% to 10% per year in the past decade.</p>
<p>Take Henry Boulton, a cloth merchant from 　 city, as an example. In 1912, he decided to invest $150 in stamps every year. After detailed research on market prices, he found that commemorative stamps were profitable, so he specialized in collecting these stamps. Seventeen years later, he had invested $2,500, but the current value of his stamp collection was $100,000! What a huge profit.</p>
<p>This seems like a pipe dream, but if readers have doubts, they can check the prices listed in the "Scott Stamp Catalogue" over the years. In 1946, a stamp collector sold 100 sets of Zeppelin airmail stamps for $6,000. He had purchased these stamps from the post office in 1931 at face value for $455. Another stamp collector recently sold 50 sets of the Falkland Islands Centennial commemorative stamps issued in 1933. The face value totaled only $750—which was also his cost—but he got $9,000 in return.</p>
<p>If your collection 　 contains an investment component in addition to a hobby, then don't pay too much attention to the beauty of the design. Most beautiful stamps do not increase much in price after many years because many people collect them when they are issued—stamps are also affected by the "law of supply and demand" like other goods. The one-cent stamp issued by British Guiana in 1856 has an extremely simple design, but now one is worth US$50,000. Age also has little effect on the price of stamps. The one-penny black stamp first issued by the United Kingdom in 1840 is now worth only $25, and that is limited to unused ones. The four-penny orange-red stamp issued by Nicaragua in 1938, however, has risen to $8 in just ten years. No one can predict how much it will be worth in 100 years.</p>
<p>If you decide to invest in stamp collecting, you should know some common sense about stamps—their history, development, and issuance. In a few years, your investment will pay you unbelievable high profits.</p>
<h3>Earning a Living</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, advertisements for short-term deposits are always dazzling. The interest rate is increasing every day, and the principal and interest are paid in three months, which is really "generous." Today, I happened to browse a newly borrowed original book, which contained a story of an astrologer, which is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>A New York astrologer has invented a "male and female random" method. That is, couples can freely choose the gender of their baby. Pay US$50 to learn this method. If a boy is chosen but a girl is born, or a girl is chosen but a boy is born, then US$55 will be compensated. At first glance, this method is also very "generous," at least it cannot be considered a scam. But with a little analysis, the true colors are revealed. Statisticians tell us that the birth rate of men and women in the world is roughly equal. If New York produces 200,000 babies a year, then roughly 100,000 will be male and 100,000 will be female. Therefore, as long as 100 couples ask this astrologer for advice, even if he has a low forehead and guesses wrong 50 couples, after deducting US$2,750 in compensation, he can still earn a net profit of US$2,250.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>"Jinshi" is the highest stage of fame and wealth. In the years of "Chou," "Chen," "Wei," and "Xu" (this refers to the regular examinations, which are held once every three years. If an additional examination is added, this limit does not apply), the successful candidates of each province throughout the country gathered in the capital for examinations, which were presided over by specially appointed ministers. After three rounds, the "Xiaolian Gong" (successful candidates) numbering one or two ten thousands were selected with 200 to 300 people, called "Hui Shi" (Metropolitan Examination). Those who passed the "Hui Shi" would still have to go through the "Dian Shi" (Palace Examination, not held in the examination hall, but in the Imperial Palace Hall, with the Emperor giving the questions, which was solemn and unparalleled) to become a "Jinshi" (Successful Candidate). Jinshi are divided into three ranks, the first rank being only three people, who were given special treatment and immediately appointed to the Hanlin Academy. The first ranked were appointed as "Xiuzhuan" (Compiler, like Zhang Jian from Nantong), and the second and third ranked were appointed as "Bianxiu" (Editor, like Yu Biqian, who currently resides in Beiping). The second and third ranks, with a certain number of people each, were only given the qualification of "Jinshi," and had to go through "Chao Kao" (Court Examination), then be screened and announced. The best ones were the "Shujishi" (Bachelors), who entered the Hanlin Academy for study, the second best were assigned to various ministries as "Zhushi" (Principal Clerks), the next best were appointed as "Zhongshu" (Secretaries) to the Inner Cabinet, and the next best were appointed as "Zhixian" (County Magistrates) and assigned to various provinces. Therefore, among the two to three hundred Jinshi in each examination, only a few dozen could enter the Hanlin Academy. These few dozen Shujishi still had to study at the "Shuchang Guan" (Hall of Bachelors) until their term expired and then be screened and tested again. The best ones were appointed as "Bianxiu" (Editors) and "Jiantao" (Reviewers), and the next best were still assigned to other departments and provinces as "Zhushi" (Principal Clerks) and "Zhixian" (County Magistrates), which was called "San Guan" (Graduation from the Hall of Bachelors). Those who passed the "San Guan Shi" (Graduation Examination) and remained in the Academy were fully entitled to "Hanlin" (Member of the Hanlin Academy). Those who changed their posts after "San Guan," although they had left the Academy, had gone through the "Shujishi" stage and had entered the Hanlin Academy, so they could still be called "Hanlin" with some justification. For example, Xiong Xiling was dismissed before he could work at the Hall because of the Reform Movement of 1898, but he had indeed entered the Hanlin Academy. Therefore, it is somewhat justified to call him "Old Hanlin Xiong."</p>
<p>Since the "Hanlin Academy" was an official department, entry into the Hanlin Academy had to be selected from among many Jinshi, which was the usual practice. But there were also exceptional cases: (1) The "Boxue Hongci Ke" (Special Examination for Learned Scholars) in the early Qing Dynasty, in which the Qing court ordered the major provinces to recommend well-known figures with outstanding literary talent and high prestige, regardless of whether they had achieved academic fame, to the capital for an imperial examination, and the best ones were awarded Hanlin officials (Readers, Lecturers, Compilers, Reviewers, and Bachelors). (2) The examination for students who had studied abroad at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in which those who had completed their studies in the East and the West and returned to China, registered in Beijing, and took a regular examination were first awarded the qualifications of Jinshi or Juren (Recommended Man), depending on their academic qualifications and examination results. Then they were graded and awarded positions such as Hanlin, Departmental Secretary, Petty Official in the Capital, and County Magistrate. For example, Yan Huiqing Junren in Shanghai and Wu Dingchang Dashuan in Nanjing both entered the Hanlin Academy through the examination for students studying abroad (Yan was appointed as Compiler and Wu was appointed as Reviewer). Although they had not gone through the Rural Examination and the Metropolitan Examination, since they were appointed to a post and entered the Academy, the glory of "golden hat and court beads, purple robes and sable coats," and the prestige of "jade hall and golden horse" were the same as those who entered through the old examination hall. It has been almost forty years since then, which is enough for them to be called "Old Hanlin."</p>
