<p>國務院官員頃發表一聲明，評述最近退休之美西太平洋艦隊司令柯克上將之言論。按柯克上將在接見合衆社記者稱：美國並未在中國所採取之政策中明確其目的，柯克上將并要求成立「堅强的委員會」以指導美國在華之行動。國務院對此一委員會之建議，拒絕作直接評述。</p>
<p>〔合衆社加州索諾馬廿一日電〕曾任西太平洋美海軍司令之柯克上將，廿一日單獨接見合衆社記者時，認爲在西太平洋方面美國正已敗於蘇聯，渠抨擊美國過去在中國之行動幷無效率。</p>
<p>問以渠是否認爲美國如欲恢復昔日地位爲時已遲，柯克答稱：美國首先應對下列二問題予以明確解答，卽「吾人在東方之目的爲何？」又「比等目的之必要生如可，及吾人支持比等目的至何種程度？」柯氏繼稱，美國對華玫策素未明確，有些時期吾人一無所爲，有些時期又曾採取許多行動，但如吾人有肯定及持久之目的，即應一直加以支持。吾人不能在中國採取雙重玫策，一方面企圖在國民政府下重建繁榮以限制共產主義之發展，另一方面則又聽任中共獲得蘇聯之無限制援助而縱兵竄擾，而且蘇聯尚與中國政府訂有友好同盟條約·</p>
<p>關於前者，國會曾於本年春季通過大量撥款援華，其中一部份係軍事援助，但就余最近所悉，（雖然余不知其是否正確）第一艘載運軍火赴華之船艦，尚係一星期前自西雅圖開出者，吾人之行動如此遲緩，當然喪失時效，余敢斷言，如吾人在撥付援華款項及裝運援華物資上繼續如此遲緩，在執行吾人欲達成之目的之行動上繼續如此遲緩，而竟致國民政府失敗，則吾人財富之消耗，均等於白費。</p>
<p>吾人決不能擺脫對中國之道義責任，而認爲吾人在中國內戰中應袖手旁觀，吾人決不能忘却，吾人曾將蘇聯之勢力，引入東北·華北·北韓及千島列島，吾人曾浪費一年半之時間，企圖將中共拉入中國政府，事實上在蘇聯取代吾人而控制西太平洋區之過程中，東北早已斷送於共產主義者之手，吾人曾在中國引狼入室，又如何能轉而指斥中國政府腐敗無能，而不予援功。</p>
<p>記者詢以共產黨在中國之勝利是否即共產黨控制全亞洲之謂，柯克將軍答稱：「無人能答覆此一問題，但共產黨在印尼，馬來亞及荷屬東印度等地之活動，則事實俱在，渠等是否能聯合一致，余尙無從獲悉，不過日本將被迫墮入共產黨勢力圈之危機，則顯然增加」。</p>
<h3 id="c16">蔣夫人對美廣播全文 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕蔣夫人應美國廣播公司之約請，於廿一晚九時對美發表廣播演說，全詞如决，。</p>
<p>美國的朋友們，我此刻是在中國的首都南京向各位講話。</p>
<p>最近有許多國外人士邀請我前往美國，向各位解釋中國的現局，因爲我國目前正與共匪作生死的搏鬥，我雖感謝各方面的盛意，但無法分身，所以今天欣然接受美國廣播公司的約請，借無綫電的傳遞與各位作此一省談話。</p>
<p>中國目前的局勢確乎十分嚴重，我絲毫不想掩飾。冬天即將降臨，我國同胞在可怕的困苦際遇之下，饑寒交迫，憂心如焚。這種情形並不是因爲中國缺乏糧食及燃料，而是因爲接着日本人數年的蹂躪之後，共匪有計劃的破壞交通，使大部分地區的物資無法流通，而在這種封鎖毒計之外，共匪復散佈狡詐狠厲的宣傳，無可否認地削弱了許多人民的勇毅之氣。最近若干軍事上的逆轉，當然也是助長這種宣傳的因素之一，如果你們要明白中國的實際情形，必先知道這個宣傳因素在中國現局中所佔的重要性。</p>
<p>共黨宣傳的陰險毒辣，還需要我向美國聽衆解釋嗎？兩年以來你們早已熟悉共黨如何在美國施展其伎倆了·美國政府有一位忠實的公務員未署眞姓名，在十月廿日的讀者文摘發表了一篇文章，詳述共產黨對於異己者如何用種種方法加以陷害脅迫。共產黨發現了此人的眞名實姓之後，就散佈種種迫害他的謠言，使他同城的居民（我要提醒各位這是在美國的城市）都反對他，甚至反對他的妻子兒女，迫得他祗得遷居他州。我讀到這個消息之後，我驚奇地聲得這和共匪在中國的策略竟毫無二致，方式是相同的。美國對於中國情形的許多誤解，推其原委實在由於共匪反共產國際歪曲事實所造成。</p>
<p>中國共匪和世界其他各地的共產份子一樣，是慣用宣傳　朦世人的專家，他們爲要在國內外損毀政府的威望，更無所不用其極，以侮蔑總統和我，以及我們家庭中的人。當我國抗日之時，因爲抗日恰巧合乎共匪的目的，他們便稱讚我們是英雄，但在今天却把中國一切弊病都歸因在我們身上。國內有些易受欺朦的人士，以及認識應該比較淸楚的其他人士，不知不覺間竟接受了這些共匪的虛妄宣傳。言之令人痛心。後面一種人都是些怯懦者，意志薄弱者與遷就姑息之流。還有那些冀圖討好共匪以備共匪勝利時得倖免災禍的人。大家對於歷來各决戰爭中的投機與動搖份子，諒都知道，不幸現中國也不免有這一類的人，但若共匪滿以爲這些宣傳詭計便已削弱了中國政府的意志，則他們的估計實係完全錯誤。現在我可以向美國友人保證，近來雖曾經有若干令人失望的事情，但總統和我並沒有絲亳氣餒，我們決心繼續從事剿共的正義之戰，以免國家墮入鐵幕的後面去。現在我們的意志與開始剿匪時同樣堅强而未動搖，我們最後勝利的信念也極旺盛。我們覺得人生的日程已過去了泰半，我們謹願上帝保佑，將我們的餘年繼續獻身於建設自由中國的工作上。這是在過去二十五年中我們一貫忠誠致力的工作。總統與我祗要一息尚存，必將堅決作戰，以解除萬惡共匪的威脅，即不幸失敗，除嗟嘆人生短暫，僅此一生以報效國家外，別無遺憾。（未完明日續）</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿一日電〕蔣夫人對美國民衆之廣播，已獲得此間朝野相當之注視。若干廣播站且將蔣夫人演辭之紀錄片，爲未曾聆悉之人士再度播送。同時，此間各晨報亦將蔣夫人演詞之全文刊於顯著地位。前鋒論壞報首頁篇幅，以大字標題謂：蔣夫人籲請美國速予援助，否則共軍將橫行亞洲。紐約時報亦將蔣夫人演詞刊於內頁，其標題稱：蔣夫人請美國在此鬥爭中再予支持，若美國希望遏止亞洲方面之共軍統治，則須急速援華·</p>

<h3 id="c17">封存貨物的處理原則 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>在經管加强時期，凡因倉庫總檢查，存貨聲記，及特別檢舉而對存餉物資，其數量極爲可觀。除陸續淸理，分別決定處分辦法外，其尚未解決的懸案，據聞尚不在少數。封存物賢處理委員會對於此項懸案，爰經商定原則，着手淸結，這自然是大家所熱切盼望的事。</p>
<p>由於物價步漲的結果，這一類被封的物資，也常有因禍得福，以「勒令囤積」之故，而獲得意外利益的，但就一般而論，這些存戶所遭精神上與物質上的損失，究屬莫大之痛苦。據傳有被封存之貨主某，迭經據理申訴，居然得蒙發還，不覺欣喜逾聖。迨開倉啓視時，以爲時太久，貨巳泰半　壞，不堪再行使用，竟將綫單委棄於地，廢然而去，這也可見商人損失之一班。原來各種貨物，其耐久性的程度不一，而執行封存的機關又不止一個，等到東摸西撞，找着堪以處理的機關時，再經過調查·審議·請示·決定等等手續，當然不像封存時那樣簡捷，無怪有許多耐久性較差，和堆存不甚得法的貨物，都要變質變樣了。</p>
<p>現在既巳決定了處理原則，我們當然盼望他們從速辦理，以免加重貨主的損失，其决則如何處理和辦理手續；我們以爲　，仍應當以法律爲最高的原則。</p>
<p>是項法律，除糧食部份另有特別法可資依據外，其餘自以非常時期取締日用重要必需品囤積居奇辦法，農礦工商管理條例，及以後部令頒佈的取締囤積居奇辦法注意事項和補充要點爲最正當的標準。按照這些法令，凡應當罰辦和沒收的，具見於辦法第十七十八兩條，而所謂囤積的條件規定爲（一）中央和地方所依法公佈的日用重要必需物品，其類目凡五：即食用，服用，燃料，日用品，及其他經呈准指定餉物品。換句話設：凡不在上開特別指定的物品以內的，和並未經過依法公告手續的，應不適用上項法律。又（二）構成囤積的要件，爲：（一）非經勞商業之人，或非經營本業之商人，大量購存前述所指定物品者，（二）經營本業之商人購存上述指定之物品而有居有行爲者。其居奇行爲，在本法巳釋明爲不應市銷售，而抬價超過當地主管官署所規定之合法利潤者，則凡巳經應市銷售，而抬價不超過合法利潤，或當地主管官署根本沒有規定過這項合法利潤的。依然自不得指爲居奇。至於大量云云，在注意事項中，經釋明爲（一）屬於直接消費物品，凡超過每人三個月需要量者爲大量，（二）屬於營業需要物品，凡超過全年需要量五分之一至三分之一者爲大量，而在補充要點中，則規定：如屬於本業商人營業需要之物品，不得超過每年需要量四分之一，有季節性者除外。照此補充規定，可知：（一）三個月之限量，只是對人民之自用消費品而言，在營業需要量中並不適用；（二）營業需要量，或稱全年四分之一，或稱五分之一乃至三分之一，顯系自亂其例，在法律上並無明確的解釋；（三）有季節性的物品，得不受上述五分一，四分一，或三分一的限制。所以通常所稱囤積三月以上的貨物應予沒收云云，只可認爲對於囤商的一種警告，在法律上，其實還找不到相當的根據。</p>
<p>至於撿查時或登記時發覺數量不符，或多報，或少報，或種類花色不甚相符的，這類封存的貨物，大部份恐怕還是手績上的錯誤。且在登記以後，報載有關當局曾繩令飭：仍應照常發售，不得藉故拒絕；則在相隔若干日後再行實地調查時，以遵令發售，或隨時補進的關係，其存量不能相符，又是無可避免的事實。如因此而加以沒收處分，於情似覺欠恕；於法亦無依據。須知舉行登記之時，其遵令查報的，固居多數，而延不登記的，爲數恐亦不少；且在公告登記之初，好像只說到爲明瞭產銷情形，或統籌配銷起見，當時並沒有漏報浮報即須沒收充分的預告，所以在事後創辦過嚴，我們很認爲過當，而且抗不遵令登記的，倒一些有關礙，未免太便宜了。</p>
<p>我們設這些話，並沒有替一班奸商曲予迥護的意思，相反地，凡屬情眞罪當的囤戶，我們也同樣地主張，要加以嚴厲的制裁。不過任何制裁，必須依據法律，方好教他們甘服，其威情有可原，或法律並無正條可援引的，仍應准予發還，或從輕發落，以維護正當商人的權益。現在巳蹈入行憲的階段了，而且各種管制的法令，時有變更，張弛不定；在今日所認爲罪大惡極，應予嚴辦的，在明日忽又眞正成了明日黃花，認爲無足重輕了。此類事例，不少概見。古人說得好：如得其情，則哀矜而勿喜；在這上無道揆，下無法守的當兒，似乎還是寗寬無濫，多少可以維繫些人心吧！</p>

<p>茲將潘議長，吳市長，宣司令，及各參議員發表各項意見分誌於後：</p>
<p>首由潘議長致詞，略稱：本會第七次大會於九月十五日休會，那時候正當是本市嚴格實行限價，社會的外表上，似乎比較為近年來最安定的一個時期，可是曾幾何時，由於上海嚴格管理，而各地放鬆，形成限價政策的失敗，初則發生搶購與藏貨不售的風潮，繼之以政府放棄限價，而物價於是像脫　之馬，奔騰直上，而且依然是有價無市。另一方面，則以剿匪軍事的逆轉，東北和豫魯若干名城相繼棄守以後，戰事重心已經轉移到蘇北徐州一帶。在這種經濟現象與軍事形勢相互激攝之下，後方城市，尤其是京滬一帶的人心，不免都浮動起來，兼以共匪潛伏份子乘機故弄玄虛，製浩謠言，使整個社會發生無謂的騷動，失敗主義的氣氛，逐漸瀰漫，甚至於許多知識份子，社會領袖，也都或多或少中了共匪宣傳攻勢的毒素，受了共匪神經戰的壓迫，以為政府力量將難以為繼。不但極少有人去用冷靜的頭腦，考慮一下成敗得失的後果，與夫這次戰爭是一個世界和平國族安危所繫的反侵略反極權的戰爭，然後推己及人，善為領導，以提高一般同胞的警覺，一正國際的視聽，居然還有人會附合「和謠」，這種一連串要不得的妄動，假如不是總統之指揮若定，以堅定不拔之意志，嚴正加以駁斥，現在的局面正不知演變到什麼地步了。公展以為戡亂雜國成敗的關鍵，軍事和人心有着同樣的重要，軍事上一城一池的得失，未必卽足以影響大局，而成敗的關鍵，完全把提在我們自己一念之中，一夫夜呼，存勗覆亡，四面楚歌，垓下敗績，這種摭拾卽是的歷史陳跡，處處都可以說明失敗主義之心理是萬萬要不得的。於此不禁要指出於共匪作亂的三年之中，政府始終不願放棄民主政治之推行，努力於「平時狀態」之維持，這種苦心孤詣，應該值得我們愛戴，司是共匪也恰好利用這種機會，使潛伏份子滲入社會各階層，製造出各種各類的事件，破壞社會秩序，妨害社會安寗，擾亂人心，莫此為甚。前方軍事的動向，固足以影響後方的人心，而後方人心的浮動，尤足以渙散前方的士氣，我們應該痛下針砭，決不可使這種浮動現象，重演下去。假若以上所言為不謬，則本會同仁，在時局艱危社會動盪之今日，應該以協助政府，安定人心為第一要務，使全體上海市民堅強的團結起來目衛，成為維護中國民主政治之偉大堡壘。公展今天還要申述的，現在當局正在研究如何實施一個戰時體制的內閣，各戰區己經在軍事第一剿匪高於一切的共同目標下，逐步加強總體戰的措施。</p>
<p>請吳市長宣司令解釋總體戰體制</p>
<p>京滬區最近已經劃成一個警備區，軍事政治經濟以致於社會的活動，個人的生活，都將要置於總體戰計劃之形態之下，從事改革。總體戰體制之內容如何，本市一般人還不能十分瞭然，今天要請吳市長宣司令即席為我們作一次指示。可是公展相信，我們為了求得剿匪軍事的勝利，為了爭取國家民族的獨立與自由，在這一個撥亂反正的嚴重時期，人民便不能不暫時犧牲一部份個人的自由，放棄某種方面的若干利益，接受若干非常的約束。換言之，在戒嚴法令裏所規定的一切，我們都該充份地去忍受。政府施政方面，也許若干部門，都要與軍事行動相配合，甚至要置於軍事的統一指揮之下，亦為意料所及的。本會參議員同仁，無論為區域為職業團體所選舉，或是黨派所遴選，其為代表全市全體市民則一，於實施總體戰體制之下，我們應該做些什麼工作，如何去完成我們的任務，這都是值得大家深思熟慮一番的。同時，我也希望我們的軍政當局，在這個總體戰計劃還在擬訂的階段，或還未拿到本市來實施的時候，能够體察到上海是中國第一都市，無論就政治經濟社會文化任何方面來講，反應都十分靈敏，而上海的一切動象，尤其足以影響到全國，必要時，為了一切計劃推行順利，出門合轍起見，多少能够予民意代表的本會，在某種限度以內，有斟酌貢獻的機會，俾以我們平時之所見所聞，每一個人智慧與能力，都可以為國家為地方有所盡力。相信這應是需要本會同仁善盡職責的一個起碼條件。</p>
<h3 id="c73">保衛家鄉生命財產籲請市民趕籌的款 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>其次，「財政為庶政之母」，市庫收入，假若不能充裕，一切市政設施的計劃便等於具文。時局艱危，瀕臨絕境，而本市財政的困難，也已到了極端。本會同仁有監督市財政的責任，同時也有帮助市政當局解除財政困難道義上的義務。我們固然希望市政當局减少一些不必要的開支，尤其在今日，不必再有任何粉飾太平的廢費，然而擺在眼前的幾件大事，例如成立警備旅與自衛總隊的開辦費與給養，本市警公激人員的薪津，在在都需要開源來挹注·關於警備旅與自衛總隊，已經是本會久所企望的地方自衛武力，公展記得在本年年初第五次大會開幕時曾經為本市的治安着想，籲請本市市民趕緊籌集的款，編練地方武力，協助國軍保衛家鄉，以地方之餉精款項，養地方之團練民兵，以地方的團練民兵，衛地方之生命財產。今天我們所要求的，正復如是。本市市民，尤其富商大賈，必須警惕「覆巢之下無完卵」的古訓，盡量在「一切為剿匪一切為軍事」之目標下，慷慨輸將，以充份培養本市的地方武力。至於警公教人員的待遇，如何提高，使其能維持是低生活，亦是當前的嚴重問題。蓋希望將士奮勇殺敵，必須兵精糧足，士飽馬騰，而希望警公教人員安心服務，努力於崗位工作，也必須使他們的收入足够仰事俯蓄。軍警是國家的干城公，教人員是社會的中堅，其地位是同等重要。這一點，相信本會同仁都能體會得到的·不過如何開源，確是當前一個重要課題，我們要請吳市長發表意見。但無論如何，照我們的計算，假如市稅之中若干項目，收入能够跟着物價機動調整者，作一番好好的整理，供給警公教人員的薪津，勉可敷用。而對於建立地方武力的支出，開關財源，當不可免。所開財源，不但希望也能跟着物價有機動調整的性能，更盼是根據有錢出錢的原則而來·我們祇有眞正「有錢出錢有力出力」，而後可以剿平共匪，保障這個都市乃至我們國家的安全。</p>
<p>眼前時機切勿坐失</p>
<p>最後要申述，却也是最重要的一點，便是本會召開這次座談會，恰好在徐州會戰勝利結束之時。這一段時間，值得我們欣慰，更值得我們寳貴。何以言之，徐州會戰之大捷，堪稱為我國存亡絕續的轉捩之機，這次大捷在軍事方面所獲的戰果，是擊潰了共匪二十萬人之衆，保衛了江淮數百里山河，而政治經濟以及國際方面所收功效尤大。捷報傳來，不但人心振奮，物價狂瀉，同時使美國朝野改變了對我國政府的看法，足以予援華工作以極大的影響。這種種確是年來不可多得的跡象。目前這一個寳貴的時機，我們應該好好的來利用，應該痛定思痛，追究已往國事敗壞的根源而有所作為，重新樹立起政府失去的威信，謀政洽上的革新，與民更始，然後國家才有希望，然後得道多助，美援亦可不期其來而自來，不期其加強而自加強。本會召集一次全體座談會的動機，原由於本市公共交通公司籌備委員會資產估價一案要待今天大家來審查，不過正當時局艱危，社會動盪之秋，若干重要問題，乃不得不借此難得的聚會彼此交換意見以岡貢獻於國家。公展蒿目時艱，棖觸萬端，以上所述·不免急不擇辭，自多疎略，尙希緒位同仁，多多指教。</p>
<h3 id="c74">浦江天險匪難飛越　吳市長呼籲保衛大上海 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>吳市長致詞：目前上海最嚴重的問題有三：（一）糧食問題：現米糧恐慌業已過去，食米源源而來，且米價業已下潟至四百元左右，預料不致再有大彼動。（二）工資問題：十一月上半月指數之編製絕對芷確，工人所以不能滿意者，因當時米價曾謠傳有每擔二千元者，自不能列為標準。現勞資糾紛由社會局總工會等努力調處，當可逐漸解決。（三）財政問題：此乃目前最難應付的問題，公教人員生活淸苦已極，而市府收支却又無法平衡，市府望參議會協助，如何調整稅收，俾謀收支之平衡。至於總體戰問題，詳細辦法待由宣司令報告。本人覺得逃往香港的人是最愚蠢的，如若共匪襲聲華南，不出兩個月香港必成孤鳥。那時香港人將逃往那裏去？</p>
<p>上海有的是工廠，銀行，外匯，其財富足養大軍十五萬，而且黃浦江又是天然界限，江中設列防衛據點，共匪就攻不進來。只要上海能守住一個月，就可以奠定勝利基破，守住二個月，就可以得到世界各國同情，守住三個月，友邦自然會以大量軍火接濟我們，所以只要上海人有決心，有勇氣，袪除逃避心理，相互合作，共同保衛大上海。</p>
<h3 id="c75">宣司令報告總體戰要旨 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>宣司令致詞：淞滬地區總體戰，由地方黨政軍議會及其他有關機關首長組織委員會共同監督之。其實施辦法之要者為（一）軍事部門：應盡力充實力量，無論警備旅，保安團，保安警，民衆自衛隊等，均須積極訓練，加強地方武力補充部隊及兵源均應加以改良，好在有黃浦江天然險固，可以保衛上海。（二）政治部門：加強區公所鎭公所保辦公處之組織，淸查戶口及浦江船隻，使共匪份子不能潛伏，嚴懲食污，厲行考核，整飭政治風紀，及齡壯丁一概服役，並組織兒童隊婦女隊，人民一致動員起來。（三）經濟部門亦應改善，因共匪是以經濟改革為進攻方策，我們本身應先改好，然後可予打擊。我們要爭取民衆，組訓民衆，運用民衆，以整個民衆力量來消滅共匪。</p>
<h3 id="c76">大員眷屬逃香港參議員紛紛指摘 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>參議員意見：（一）姜豪：人民是絕對擁護政府的，過去種種事實足以證明人民並無對不起政府的地方，唯有政府對不起人民。製造謠言的不僅是共匪，而是政府大員。他們呌人民勿逃，而自己的眷屬却先溜走。國事臨此嚴重關頭，政府本身切不能再有黨派鬥爭，亟應眞誠合作，以挽危局，（二）張志韓；總體戰實施期間，軍隊亟應嚴守紀律，不能到處擾民，然後才能談軍民合作。（三）施宗德：政府大員高唱堅守土地，而自己眷屬先逃，望地方政府檢查赴港旅客時，對是否有政府大員一點嚴密些。（四）費樹聲：市長與宣司令表示，決以黃浦江為界，堅守上海，我們誓必追隨於市長司令之後，共同保衛上海。但對於已逃往香港的政府大員眷屬，我們應呌他們立卽回滬，否則沒收其在滬財產，並革其官職。對於共匪之宣傳報刊應禁其入口，香港方面歪曲廣播，亦應擾亂電波，勿使市民收聽。（五）張中原：王雲五和王世杰的眷屬，不但逃往香港，而且逃到美國，對於這批人，政府應立卽開除其國籍。本市應力求社會安定與糧貪充足。（六）周祥生：其實杳港並非安逸士，是四而環水之孤島，一旦遭逢轟炸，卽無地避難。（七）吳正矱：市長對閻錫山堅守太原極表欽佩，我們希望市長亦能一學問氏有所表示，寗以上海為葬身地，決不離開上海。（八）季灝：大家決不能存逃難的心理。（九）虞舜：政府的政策決不能常常變動，則民心可安定，工商能正常，地方亦可保衛。（十）嚴諤聲：我們應組織一審查會，審查赴港者是否有其必要，對於純然為逃難而去者，每人限捐二千元充作本市難民救濟金。至於營業稅方面，希望减少捐率，以維商艱。（十一）江浩然：中央政治與地方政治亟應配合，一切均以因地制宜因人制宜來做，上海所抽的壯丁，不要送往台灣，就在上海保衛本地。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕管理外匯交易新辦法，昨日起開始實行。央行昨以一第一六〇號通函通知各指定銀行一，卽日起一切外匯交易，概依下列之規定辦理：</p>
<p>（一）因貨物輸出所得之外匯，應全郃經由指定銀行移轉與中央銀行，由指定銀行發給同等價值之外匯移轉證。</p>
<p>（二）國外中國僑民匯回本國之外匯（包括一切由國外匯入之匯款），應全部經由其指定銀行，移交中央銀行，由指定銀行發給同等價值之外匯移轉證，或按照當日外匯移轉證之市價，逕行結售與央行或其指定銀行。</p>
<p>（三）外匯移轉證得向央行或其指定銀行兌換國外電匯或信匯，以作下列用途：（甲）經輸管會核發許可證之進口貨物付款，（乙）由政府核害「非進口貨物」之外匯需要。</p>
<p>（四）外匯移轉證可由指定銀行或外匯經紀人自由買賣，移轉證支付外匯之有效時期為二十天。</p>
<p>（五）到期後之移轉證，必須結售與央行或其指定銀行，其結售之匯率，係以有效期間最後一日之最低市價為標準。</p>
<p>（六）央行前發給各指定銀行之通函中，如其條例有與本通函規定抵觸者，應以後者為準。</p>
<p>指定銀行辦理外匯移轉程序</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於實施「外匯移轉證」辦法，央行昨以第一六一號通函致各指定銀行加以說明，全文共十一點，其要義如次：</p>
<p>（一）指定銀行須於收到外匯後，方得發售外匯移轉證，此證之發給，應以聯號為之。</p>
<p>（二）發出移轉證所收到之外匯，指定銀行須於當日營業時間結束後，移轉興中央銀行，並附以移轉證之第二副張。</p>
<p>（三）將外匯移轉與央行，得在上海廣州天津辦理，但因央行支付移轉證之外匯時，須視當地指定銀行是否在央行存有外匯而定。</p>
<p>（四）指定銀行得應由客戶之申請，將所得外匯分發移轉證一張或數張，但外匯總數不得有所不同，其他要點亦不得有所更改。</p>
<p>（五）外匯移轉證持四聯單制，正本由指定銀行發給與客戶，副本由指定銀行保留作參考，第三張由指定銀行會同外匯移交與央行，第四張與指定銀行交易報告書一併交呈央行。</p>
<p>移轉證之管理較結匯證寬簡</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市指定銀行公會於昨日午後三時假中行舉行臨時會員大會，到會員銀行中，交，農，花旗匯豐等二十八家代表，陳長桐主席，首由邵曾華吳長斌等報告有關外匯管理之160　161　162三通函之內容，逐點予以解釋，遂卽舉行會議，商定要案如次：</p>
<p>（一）外匯交易自今日（二十三）起恢復。</p>
<p>（二）外匯交易手續費仍為1.25％</p>
<p>據某指定銀行負責人表示：外匯移轉證之性質，與改幣前之結匯證明書大同小異，惟其管理辦法較前為寬大簡單，前者期限為七天，後者放寬至兩個月，者前有「普通」「特別」之分，後者則無。故今後外匯移轉證之交易，可不受時間及數量上之控制，而能完全反映市塲之需要，產生自然水準之市價·對於進出口貿易之推進可獲得技術上之方便，對於吸收僑匯亦大有助力。</p>
<p>規定各種外幣對金圓券比率</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於發行金圓劵修正條例及管理外匯新辦法，央行昨日已以通函第一六一號致各指定銀行，規定各種外幣對金圓券之兌換率如下：</p>

<p>羅比一羅比—金圓四元五角</p>
<p>比索一比索—金圓十元</p>
<p>中央銀行規定所有外匯移轉證僅載明美元數額，指定銀行於移轉非美元外匯時，須依照下列比例兌換率，發給外匯移轉證。</p>
<p>一英鎊—美元三元港幣一元—美元〇·一八七五元　叨幣一元—美元〇·三五元羅比一元—美元〇·二二五元</p>
<p>瑞士法郎一法郎—美元〇·二五元</p>

<p>根據綏靖會議決案，沿湘各縣止開始加強構築工事，常德至轄區各縣，尤其八區，被稱為無一寸公路之特殊地帶，將開闢新路。省公路局工程處現派有專人勘察，電訊局亦正配合此空前之交通建設運動，分頭展開建設。十七綏靖部已在當德成立示範區，並設指導委員會，以政工處長謝平兼主委及城防指揮官專責籌劃，第一期工作已開始。轄區各個鄉鎭之戶口，已整理淸楚。示範區內之十三個中學，卅餘個小學同時實施「動員戡亂建國大單元設計教學」。</p>
<p>湘西北祟山峻嶺，地區偏僻，地方情形特殊，仇殺事件時有發生，地方公正人士，目睹政府旣對仇殺案件毫未斷然處理，且不敢作任何道義的呼應，忍令土覇橫行，已非一日。十月十八日，乾城縣黨部副副書記畏秦文權，不幸為人暗殺，率司令官據報，時正當李氏到任之初，綏靖會議進行之時，大為震怒，表示決對唆教秦文權之乾城參議長向世鳳依國法從嚴懲處，為民除害。經再三偵查審訊結果，主犯向世鳳，從犯無業流氓羅興楝邛老三等殺人罪證確實，奉准各判處死刑，已於十五日由該部在常德執行槍決。是為李氏治理湘西北之第一砲。</p>

<p>為使眞相更明白一點，不得不先追述到上月初旬的時候，那時省府在開全省行政會議，會議中對省政問題之討論甚為詳盡，為了解決目前省方財政的困難，省保安司令部召集與會之縣長及其他會員，舉行秘密會議，提出「予賭博解禁以裕財政」之非正式提案。</p>
<p>增稅源</p>
<p>研討問題的時候分爲兩派，當時辯論甚為熟烈。擁護提案方面所持的理由為：「目下財政困難，尤其廣西素稱貧瘠的省份，經濟一向貧乏，加之目前環境的影響，財源更形枯竭，似已到了山窮水盡的境地，為了救濟目前窘急，必須講求開源之道，生財之路固多，惟遠水不救近火，外間頗有人建議本省開放賭博，以裕稅收。」反對派方面「以建設廳長黃榮華反對最力，他慷慨陳詞，謂過去兩年，廣西禁政已具一相當成績，今一日改變過去作風一，豈不前功盡棄，抑且因此招致禍亂，」但爭論結果，仍以擁護派人數衆多，並且說出目前賭博已成風氣，與其陽奉陰違的存在民間，倒不如爽脆的開放了，或者反不至於如此厲害，政府又可從中增加一批稅源，」問題在當時相持不下，議案在形式上予以保留，事實上則待當局抉擇。</p>
<p>特別區</p>
<p>黃主席一向尊重民意，對此事並不置可否，同時則電呈某要人請示，目前雖未獲覆文，而從另一方面觀察，事情縱不獲贊同，至少亦不遭駁斥。近據官方透露：「開放已勢在必行，具體計劃亦已擬就，全省劃出柳州·梧州·龍州·南寗·貴縣·桂平·平樂·鬱林·宜山·百色等十地為「特別區」，各設俱樂部，予以有計劃之開放，形式上採取商包制，各地主持人經已派出，省方總經理內定陳壽筠（桂林市銀行經理）。」</p>
<p>目前經濟窘厄，已無可諱言，大家在山窮水盡的時候，頭腦簡單的，未免會憧憬着柳暗花明的樂境。但是今後的治安問題却值得焦慮。「奸宄何自而起？起於烟賭」。請省當局詳加考慮罷。以後怎樣，遲早總有事實會給以解答的。</p>
<p>餉捐局</p>
<p>今年九月間，省府爲嚴禁鴉片之種運，在南寗設立禁烟督辦公署，另於鬱林·梧州等地設分處，組成一個嚴密的禁烟機構。從過去幾個月中，緝獲運毒的成績看來，太省對禁毒已下了狠大的決心，而偏偏在雷厲風行數月後的今日，傳出了另一種流言，而且已有相當的跡象。據說：「本省禁烟將改變已定之方針，在省內仍一概嚴禁種烟與買賣行為，而於過境到省外去的，暫予放寬」。這又必須談到技術問題。據傳，當局正考慮如何改組禁烟機構與如何顧及大局，於是禁烟處似又將有改為「餉捐局」的跡象了·最傷關筋的該是事情的後果，以後後果究將如何！且待最近的未來印證！</p>

<h3 id="c122">醜惡的三K黨 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 調鸚</p>
<p>「羅斯福是共產黨！」</p>
<p>「羅斯福的目標，是想建立一個共產黨統治的世界帝國！」</p>
<p>「杜魯門政府是一個信奉猶太教的共產主義政府！」</p>
<p>凡是稍有常識的人，聽到了這些荒唐無聊的醜詆，大概至多不過付之一笑罷？然而，現在美國正有人在這樣大叫大鬧，傳單和小冊齊飛，儼然造成了一種如火如荼的運動。而更令人難以置信的，是：居然有不少人把這些話認為信條，紛紛要求加入這個運動。那些瘋狂的人們增強了一個美國有史以來最醜惡的團體——三K黨（The　Ku　Klux　Klan）。</p>
<p>三K黨人一向以虐害有色人種為要務，無辜的黑人們常常被他們以慘不忍覩的手段加以殘殺，這就是有名的Lynching。奇怪的是，卽使司法界也竟會加以寬容，故作痴聾，不予理會，於是美國的南部諸州，三K黨的力量愈來愈大。美國的南北戰爭是為了解放黑奴而起的，然而戰爭結束之後，這些黨人竟然仍舊經常秘密集會。到一九三零年左右，三K黨的領袖們因到處訛詐錢財，名譽狼藉，祗好暫時銷聲匿跡。但是，最近杜魯門總統正式提出了人權法案，重申保障黑人的平等地位之後，南部諸州的三K黨竟然乘機蠢動，公開擴充組織，吸收了不少新的黨人！</p>
<p>三K黨的黨人都以白布蔽體，頭上戴一個尖角形的布罩。蒙住面部，眼部留出兩孔，狀如歐洲十七八世紀的劊子手。一方面見得猙獰可怖，和他們的恐怖手段相符，另一方面却未始不是惟恐在行凶時被人認出了面目。然而那塊蔽體的白布却並不很長，所以黨人的所穿的袴子是露在外面的。最近，一個美國新聞記者去採訪三K黨開會的消息，却看見好幾個黨人穿的都是警察制服！警察的態度都如此，三K黨的無法無天也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>各州三K黨的領袖叫做「大龍」（Grand　Dragon）。阿特侖他州的「大龍」却是一個中年的醫生，名字叫格林。本年八月間，當地新黨人宣誓入黨的一天，那位「大龍」穿了一件綠緞大袍，步上祭台，公然宣稱：「人種的分別原是天意！本黨決定維護白種人的優越地位，本黨決定把南部諸州交還給白種人治理……要是他們北方人竟要輕舉妄動，那就休怪我們不客氣，我們是不怕流血的！」</p>
<p>據那位「大龍」說，喬治亞全州的一百五十九個城市之中，有一百三十個城市裏都已經組織了三K黨。此外，如泰納西，阿拉白瑪，佛祿利大等州，都已有很龐大的組織。他們的任務是反黑人，反猶太人，反天主教徒。如果你曾碰到過一個僑居美國南部的華僑，他一定會告訴你：三K黨對中國人也實在不大客氣。</p>
<p>三K黨不怕流血，也許是眞的。在喬治亞州，一對黑人夫妻在黃昏時候走路，三五個「不怕流血」的三K黨人一擁而上，把這兩個黑人用皮鞭抽得遍體浴血，結果竟一點沒有受到處分。阿拉白瑪州有一個專供黑人女子寄宿的宿舍，在本年六月中的某夜，大批蒙面的三Ｋ黨人衝了進去，幹出了駭人聽聞的獸行—然而當局竟然並未追究！原因是，當地的警察署長設，他部下的警察中三K黨實在太多。</p>
<p>美國的有識之士覺得他們鬧得太不像話，正在用全力來遏止這些蒙面暴徒的活動。報紙和宗教團體不斷抨擊，然而三K黨的活動始終沒有受到眞正的制裁。在一九二五年，曾經有五萬個蒙白布的怪物昂然在華盛頓的大街上游行，而他們的幕後人則乘機要挾，發了幾千萬美元的大財。現在雖然情勢不同，然而鼓動三K黨再起的却也是具有相當力量的政客，他們的目的是威脅黑人，不讓他們投票，來打擊杜魯門。但是，杜魯門終於勝利了！他是不是眞有向地方惡勢力毅然挑戰的勇氣呢？那就要有今後四年中的發展了。</p>

<h3 id="c123">校工阿金 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 莘人</p>
<p>迎着北風到校，有點冷颼颼的，想喝點開水，曖暖身子，但一拿起熱水瓶，便覺輕輕的·再看看辦公室裏，簿籍零亂，桌椅上全有着薄薄的灰塵，一點也不像往常的樣子。</p>
<p>「咦，阿金呢？」</p>
<p>校長先生回答說：</p>
<p>「他病了，今天請假。」</p>
<p>恰恰在這時候，老陳送了客，從車站上回到校裏，便接嘴說：</p>
<p>「誰說的？我親眼看見他，背了六斗米，上車去了。」</p>
<p>於是引得校長也笑起來了·校長是怪和氣的，怎會為了這件事而發怒呢？何况十塊錢一月，不另外找點副業，的確有點強人所難。</p>
<p>阿金是本學期新雇的校工，年紀五十開外，又吃過公家飯的。由他上了手，校中雜務，一切都上了軌道。比了上學期那個十多歲的女孩，連打鈴都要大家當心着的，眞不可同日語了。</p>
<p>在開頭，我們還以為阿金的工作熱忱，是由於十圓金圓鼓起的。因為依照當初的時值，足可買五斗白米，這在鄉人們看來，的確是不可多得的職業。但日子一經久，物價拼命的上漲，他還是照樣工作着·這就可見，他的辛勤，完全出於天性，一點也不作假了。</p>
<p>有好幾天，他崽了惡性的瘧疾，還勉強打起精神，到校裏來。有時，我們看到他，匍匐地坐在陽光裏，抖抖索索地，便問道：</p>
<p>「阿金，你怎麼啦？」</p>
<p>他不回答、趕忙搖着手，鄉人們是最多忌諱的，看了他那副阻人說話的樣子，眞要使人發笑。今天，他居然也染了時習，要做起單帮來了。大概是聽了一石米可換一擔糖，或四疋布的綠故吧？這除了使我們同情他的處境，更不免要深深地嘆息着「百無一用是書生」了。</p>
<p>但阿金的跑單幫，似乎並不及人家來得順利，由於他當天不見回來，大家就已看出了預兆。再聽聽人家說，因為跑的人多，利息也不及往者厚了。三十多塊的白米，到了上海，連三十塊都沒人要。帶回來的糖和香烟，銷路更成問題。但最使阿金傷腦筋的，要算是軋買票，排上了又軋下，有好幾次，幾乎被人的海擠倒在地上。好容易上了車，偏偏又跑錯路，一直趁快車到了杭州，於是罰票啦，住客棧啦，惹來了好多麻煩。今天空身回來，人彷彿老了許多，愁眉苦臉的，在算着怎樣拔還六斗米的本錢。偏偏還有老陳打趣道：</p>
<p>「阿金，杭州的風景可好？」</p>
<p>他苦笑着，不答一句話。又突然瞧了下鐘，動身打上課鈴去了。</p>

<p>我的妻子產了一子，他當然是我父親的內弟，也是我的舅父，因為他是我繼母的弟弟。</p>
<p>我父親的妻子成了我弟弟的母親，而我弟弟也是我的外孫子，因為他是我女兒的兒子</p>
<p>所以，我的妻子是我的外祖母，因為她是我母親的母親—我是我妻子的丈夫，同是也是我妻子的外孫兒—同時，我是我自己的祖父了！</p>

<p>— 葉君</p>
<p>死無葬身之地，是最慘不過的事了。但在上海這都市里，街頭的棄屍，可說已變成一般人「習焉不察」的事。在一年內，凍死的，餓死的，病死的，窮死的，老的，小的，都有。其中尤以幼小者為最多，這就足以證明在這社會里「弱者」是最不適於生存的。</p>
<p>除人屍外，還有鼠，貓，小鷄等的屍體，更是幾乎到處可見。至於像牛，羊，豕之類的死屍，是人們最好的饌饈，自然不會棄之於地了。</p>
<p>動物的屍體，不足以動人惻隱之心，還不足怪；人的屍體，若也不足以動人惻隱之心，則假使孟子所謂：「惻隱之心，人皆有之」可以成立的話，我們便可以補一句：「無惻隱之心，非人也」了。下面就是一件「非人」的事：</p>
<p>今天從找工作室窗外望去，對面牆脚下，有一具撕碎裂開的小屍體。我的學生指給我看，我看不淸，只見紅紅紫紫一串血肉，下面彷彿繫着兩條小腿，上面彷彿黑茸茸一撮毛（大概是頭髪）。學生們說這是一個小孩的屍體。旁邊圍着四五個頑童，拿石子向屍體投擲為戲·這一幕慘縈我不忍看下去，但我又想看下去，我希望能够明白分辨出來那不是人的屍體，而是動物的屍體。然而他們告訴我，的確是一具人的屍體。</p>
<p>我本來不願把這件事寫下來，因為這太慘了！但，後來覺得還是寫出來，讓多一點人知道，使這個不幸者，不致太寂寞。本文的稿酬，請編輯先生代經手捐寄給任一所兒童教養機關吧。</p>

<p>數百年的故都，宮庭苑囿壇廟剎宇一切建築之美，堪稱全國第一，卽比之世界名城，亦可占一優越地位，可惜這幾年被摧娩的不堪言狀了。不毀於抗戰之時、而毀於勝利之後，不毀於砲火，而毀於流寓之人，不毀於盜匪、而毀於「干成之士」及號稱知識界之青年，尤可痛心。</p>
<p>大壇之摧毀略見於上星期本報電訊者，為近數月之情形。在此以前、兩三年中，已經過駐紥隊伍，及另一方向之流亡青年雜居，拆拆燒燒，非一日矣。「天壇」乃以前歷代皇帝祭天之所。皇帝號稱「至尊」，但上帝之尊又在皇帝之上，皇旁爲「天子」，卽上帝的兒子。皇帝「南面」，卽坐北面南，受羣臣之朝賀，所謂「普天之下，莫非王臣」，但皇帝又是上帝之臣，在天壇只能旁坐伴食，伺候上帝，謂之「配饗」。故天壞基宇之闊大，建築之宏偉，壯麗異常，其壇作圓形（古人以為天圓地方），周圍之階級欄干，皆以　玉石雕築雲龍八寳極組。皇帝每歲南郊祭天火典，至此增大門外，卽須下輦步行，先入旁室齋戒沐浴（謂之齋宮），然後整肅衣冠，三跪九叩。堂堂九五之尊，到此亦須卑躬屈節，可知當年之森嚴無比。而今則處處黯淡，件件摧殘，一片汙穢蕭條，不禁為上帝一嘆！</p>
<p>被摧殘之另一大建築為雍和宮，其中高至丈餘之銅佛連銅座，都被抬走或殘毀拆賣，其他可想而知。此宮在舊都極北安定門內，興國子監及孔廟為隣。淸初康熙時，原是皇四子雍親王胤禎的王府·康熙駕崩，雍親王繼登大寶，卽雍正皇帝，移居皇宮，其舊居之王府，卽是「潛邸」，（取「龍潛」之義，凡由潛邸升入大內為皇者，卽是飛龍上天矣。）例不許任何貴族居住。雍正祟佛，尤喜接近喇嘛佾，故卽改為供奉番佛之地，以喇嘛若干人司香火。不曰寺院，而名爲「宮」。大小佛像，牛鬼蛇神，男女人獸，裸體互抱，所謂「歡喜佛」者，民國以來，喇嘛生活漸支絀，「宮」則開放，佛像之下體，有黃幔遮之，觀者出資，彼可揭幕，是為一種收入，亦可憫矣。今則并此亦歸消滅，生活全無依據，雍正地下有知，當作何感想？</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Nationalist Army on the Eastern Front of Xuzhou Advances, Continuing to Capture Strongholds, Ready to Join Forces at Nianzhuang, Two Major Army Groups in Northern Anhui Close in on Suxian <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] According to observers, the first phase of the Xuzhou Campaign has concluded. Currently, both sides are concentrating their main forces for the second decisive battle. The fighting in the eastern suburbs remains at a stalemate. The Huang Botao Army Group, which has been fiercely defending Nianzhuang for over ten days and nights, has not been relieved, but this has not significantly impacted the overall situation of the decisive phase. The northward advance of the two major army groups of Li Yannian and Huang Wei along the Xuzhou-Bengbu section can be seen as the prelude to our counter-encirclement of the Communists.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Qiu-Li Army Group, advancing eastward, continued to attack the Communists facing them on the 22nd. After fierce fighting until noon, they successively captured strongholds such as Dahuo Shenmiao, Xiaohuo Shenmiao, and Daxujia, continuing their eastward advance. They are now only thirty li away from the Huang Army Group and will soon formally join forces.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] On the 22nd, the Nationalist Huang Army Group firmly defended the area north of Dongdayuan, Nianzhuang, and west of Youjia Lake, including Dazhuang, Xiaozhuang, Dasongzhuang, Hehezhuang, Pengzhuangshao, and the arc-shaped area, repeatedly engaging in fierce combat with the remaining Communists.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] Military News: The army group advancing eastward from Xuzhou continued to capture strongholds such as Shaojialou, Songzhuang, and Wuyiao north and south of Daxujia on the 22nd. The fighting lasted until dawn, resulting in significant gains. The Huang Army Group, steadfastly defending Nianzhuang with extraordinary perseverance, repelled the Communists' thirteenth day and night of offensive on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Qiu-Li pursuit army groups on the eastern front are currently advancing eastward side by side along both sides of the Longhai Railway. At 11:00 AM on the 21st, the Li Army Group on the left flank, with the assistance of the air force and tanks, after three days and nights of fierce fighting, finally completely recaptured the stronghold of Maguzi (four li north of Daxujia), which was heavily defended by the Communists' 7th and 10th Columns. The reporter immediately traveled to Maguzi, the front line, by tank for inspection. Upon entering the village at 2:00 PM, it was found that all houses in the village, which had over three hundred households, were destroyed. Only an old woman of over seventy years old was seen in the entire village, and all chickens and dogs were gone. Corpses were scattered everywhere, a truly unbearable sight. The Communist artillery facing us from the Dahuo Shenmiao and Xiaohuo Shenmiao, two li away, were fiercely shelling our positions. The Nationalist artillery were returning fire, so shells were landing both in front and behind. Three shells landed next to the tank I was riding in. Our air force continued to heavily bomb the Communist army positions at Daxujia with 500-pound bombs. The artillery were concentrating their fire on the Communist positions. Black smoke filled the sky, and the noise was deafening. The reporter met General Li Mi in the village, who reported that the Communists had built three layers of fortifications outside Maguzi Village, with trenches as dense as spiderwebs, making it very difficult to capture. On the battlefield, which spanned over one hundred li east-west and seventy li north-south, both sides had fortified every village, so the Nationalist army had to fight for every inch of land and every village. The villages within the war zone were completely uninhabited. The Qiu Qingquan Army Group on the right flank recaptured Liuluji (three kilometers south of Daxujia) on the afternoon of the 21st. On the 22nd, the Nationalist army continued to advance eastward in victory.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] The two strong army groups of Li Yannian and Huang Wei, advancing northward from northern Anhui, have devised thorough countermeasures against the Communists attempting to hinder our actions. Our crack troops advancing towards the Suxian front are advancing towards Longwangmiao, south of Xisipo, on the 22nd. Senior military officials here have stated that it is not difficult to open the Xuzhou-Bengbu section of the northward advance and encirclement, nor will it take a long time. Furthermore, the Liu Communist 3rd and 9th Columns, originally based in Suxian, have since yesterday dispersed to both sides of the Jinpu Railway, with the apparent aim of threatening our army's flanks. One branch that fled eastward contacted our army near Lingbi, and the Communists suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The army groups advancing northward from northern Anhui continued to crush the Liu Communist's stubborn resistance along the way, crossed the Fei River, and entered Nanpingji, 45 li southwest of Suxian on the south bank of the Hui River, at noon on the 22nd. The army groups advancing northward from the Jinpu Line simultaneously closed in on Xisipo, southeast of Suxian. The two major army groups will be able to join forces at Suxian within days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] The two sides are still at a stalemate between Renqiao and Suxian on the Jinpu Line. The Liu Bocheng and Zhang Taisheng units are gathering south of Suxian, intending to contain the northward advance of the Li Yannian Army Group. The Huang Wei Army Group, advancing north across the Wo River, is detouring west of Suxian to strike the Communists in the back. Once the four-sided deployment is complete, a large-scale encirclement and annihilation of the Communists at Suxian will be launched. The Communists who attacked Renqiao earlier were captured over a hundred, and interrogated in Bengbu. According to their confessions, the Communists used two brigades to advance southward in this battle, suffering over a thousand casualties.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] On the southern front, our Qiu Army Group advanced southeast from Liuji, south of the city, yesterday and surrounded the 28th Regiment of the Communist Chen Geng's 4th Column at Xushancun (13 kilometers south of Xuzhou). After fierce fighting until the evening, over 1,200 Communists were killed or wounded, and 136 were captured. The entire regiment was annihilated, and four machine guns and over two hundred rifles were seized.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] On the southern front, the two regiments of the Communist New 11th Column, the 94th and 96th, fiercely attacked our Cuizhuang position last night. One company of the defending army engaged in fierce fighting with the Communists until 1:00 AM on the 22nd. The Communists abandoned over a thousand corpses and fled south. 183 people, including the political commissar of the captured camp, were captured, along with 26 machine guns and over 260 rifles.</p>

Our light cavalry units have been clearing and suppressing the areas along the Grand Canal, including Hewuwu, Matouzhen, and the northern Wangjiabanqiao area east of Tongxian, for several days, with significant results.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The Suppression Headquarters announced that Shangyi in Chabei had been safely evacuated.

They are currently continuing to advance towards Liangcheng and Helin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] At dawn on the 22nd, the Communists who had failed to attack the northwest highlands of Nuoma, east of the city, regrouped after a brief respite and launched another attack on our position in the early morning. The defending army calmly met the attack and engaged in fierce fighting with the Communists until approximately 10:00 AM, inflicting over 500 casualties on the Communists, thwarting their offensive again. After 11:00 AM, the Communists and our forces engaged in intense artillery fire in the eastern mountain area, but there was no infantry contact. All other areas were quiet. Although it was drizzling on the 22nd, the air force continued to conduct air strikes, interwoven with the sounds of artillery fire from the suburbs.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Our wounded soldiers from the Xuzhou surrounding area campaign have been airlifted to Nanjing in batches since the 21st. Over two thousand people have arrived in the past two days. While resting at the airport, they told reporters that the Communists were using human wave tactics to fiercely attack Xuzhou. The number of Communist casualties far exceeded those of the Nationalist army. During the clearing of the battlefield by the Nationalist army, Communist wounded soldiers were often found abandoned on the battlefield. Nationalist wounded soldiers, in addition to receiving rapid treatment at the front, were also airlifted to the rear for treatment, a world of difference compared to the Communist side.</p>

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 21st] A Communist broadcast statement on the evening of the 21st stated: "Any assistance given to the National Government by any foreign government, and any agreement signed between any foreign government and the National Government, cannot save the rule of the National Government or protect the rights and interests of that foreign government. The Communist Party firmly believes that any economic and military assistance given to the National Government by the United States or other governments is a hostile act against China and the Chinese people and should be stopped immediately. If the US government sends armed forces to fully or partially protect the National Government, this act will constitute an armed invasion of China's sacred territory and sovereignty, and all consequences will be borne by the US government." The statement continued: "The Chinese Communist Party, the People's Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are willing to establish equal and friendly relations with all foreign countries, including the United States, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of all foreign people in China, including the rights and interests of Americans, but China's territory and sovereignty must be kept intact and not infringed upon."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] The Chinese Communist Party issued a declaration denouncing President Chiang's request for the United States to militarily intervene in China's civil war. Political circles here regard this as a test to determine the extent of President Chiang's ability to resist and the extent to which the United States intends to aid the Chinese government.</p>

<p>He Discussed the Situation in China with MacArthur</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Major General Badawei, head of the US Joint Military Advisory Group, returned to China from Haneda Airport by army plane at 12:25 PM (Tokyo time) on the 22nd and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 PM (Shanghai time). Badawei came to Japan on the weekend of the 20th for an informal meeting with MacArthur. It is generally believed that the two discussed the situation in China. The content of this meeting is highly confidential, and no official statement has been issued. According to informed sources at the Allied Headquarters, it is logical for MacArthur and Badawei to discuss the situation in China and even exchange opinions on the situation in China. China is outside the scope of MacArthur's authority, so MacArthur often avoids matters related to China. However, on March 3, 1948, MacArthur made an exception when he published his views on China at the request of the Diet.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee convened an extraordinary meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd to discuss the current situation and party affairs. It was decided to elect Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, and more than ten others to form a small group to study and draft a reform plan for the party, government, and military, which will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and then submitted to the President for approval and implementation. The main purpose of the plan is to address the current situation and strengthen the military suppression of the rebellion. In terms of party affairs, new plans will also be formulated to address the current situation, promote the spirit of revolution, and serve as a guide for future work. It is also heard that this plan is related to the policies of the future new cabinet. Once the new plan and new policy are determined, new candidates can be proposed to reorganize the cabinet. Mr. Weng is currently waiting for this. The launch of this reform movement is actually due to the Xuzhou war and the economic situation, and will be a major transformation of the Kuomintang's spirit. When the meeting was held on the 22nd, Tian Kunshan presided over the meeting, and each committee member spoke separately. Regarding the reform plan, they all advocated adopting an active and dynamic approach, using suggestions instead of criticism. The small group is divided into two parts: one is to study party affairs, convened by Yu Youren, Chen Lifu, and others; the other is to study military, political, and economic issues, convened by Ma Chaojun, Xiao Zheng, and others. Li Wenfan, Zhang Qun, Deng Wenyi, Wu Tiecheng, Liu Wendao, and others participated, and it was decided to hold a meeting within a few days to complete the draft in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e15">US State Department Spokesman Declares, "We Will Do Our Best to Support the Chinese Government," Coke Accuses the United States of Having No Clear Policy Towards China <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] A US State Department spokesman on the 21st denied that the United States had never clarified its "purpose" in China. Supporting the Chinese government is our purpose, since World War II. We have done our best in this regard.</p>
<p>A State Department official recently issued a statement commenting on the remarks of Admiral Coke, the recently retired commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet. Admiral Coke told United Press reporters that the United States had not clarified its purpose in the policy it had adopted in China. Admiral Coke also called for the establishment of a "strong committee" to guide US actions in China. The State Department declined to comment directly on this committee's proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Sonoma, California, 21st] Admiral Coke, former commander of the US Navy in the Western Pacific, told United Press reporters in a solo interview on the 21st that the United States was losing to the Soviet Union in the Western Pacific. He criticized the inefficiency of past US actions in China.</p>
<p>When asked if he thought it was too late for the United States to regain its former position, Coke replied that the United States should first answer the following two questions clearly: "What is our purpose in the East?" and "What is the necessity of their purpose, and to what extent do we support their purpose?" Coke continued, The United States has never had a clear policy toward China. At some times we have done nothing, and at other times we have taken many actions, but if we have a definite and lasting purpose, we should always support it. We cannot adopt a dual policy in China, on the one hand attempting to rebuild prosperity under the National Government to limit the development of Communism, and on the other hand allowing the CCP to receive unlimited assistance from the Soviet Union and allowing them to harass the country, and the Soviet Union has a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Regarding the former, Congress approved a large appropriation for aid to China this spring, part of which was military aid, but to the best of my knowledge (although I don't know if it is correct) the first ship carrying munitions to China sailed from Seattle only a week ago. Our actions are so slow that we are losing time, and I dare say that if we continue to be so slow in allocating aid to China and shipping aid materials, and continue to be so slow in implementing the actions we want to achieve, and if the National Government fails as a result, then the consumption of our wealth will be equal to waste.</p>
<p>We can never get rid of our moral responsibility to China and think that we should stand idly by in China's civil war. We must never forget that we introduced Soviet power into the Northeast, North China, North Korea, and the Kuril Islands. We wasted a year and a half trying to pull the CCP into the Chinese government. In fact, in the process of the Soviet Union replacing us and controlling the Western Pacific, the Northeast had already been given to the communists. We once let the wolf into the house in China, so how can we turn around and accuse the Chinese government of being corrupt and incompetent without giving it assistance?</p>
<p>When asked whether the victory of the Communist Party in China meant that the Communist Party would control all of Asia, General Coke replied: "No one can answer this question, but the activities of the Communist Party in Indonesia, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies are all facts. I have no way of knowing whether they can unite, but the risk that Japan will be forced into the Communist sphere of influence has obviously increased."</p>
<h3 id="e16">Full Text of Madam Chiang Kai-shek's Broadcast to America <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Madam Chiang Kai-shek, at the invitation of the American Broadcasting Company, delivered a radio address to the United States at 9 p.m. on the 21st. The entire speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Friends in America, I am speaking to you from Nanjing, the capital of China.</p>
<p>Recently, many foreigners have invited me to visit the United States to explain the current situation in China. Because my country is currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the Communist bandits, I am grateful for the kindness of all parties, but I am unable to spare the time. Therefore, I am pleased to accept the invitation of the American Broadcasting Company today to have this brief talk with you via radio.</p>
<p>The current situation in China is indeed very serious, and I have no desire to conceal it. Winter is approaching, and my compatriots are suffering from hunger and cold in terrible circumstances, filled with anxiety. This situation is not because China lacks food and fuel, but because, following years of devastation by the Japanese, the Communist bandits have systematically destroyed transportation, making it impossible for materials to circulate in most areas. In addition to this blockade plot, the Communist bandits have also spread cunning and ruthless propaganda, which has undeniably weakened the courage of many people. Recent military setbacks have certainly contributed to this propaganda. If you want to understand the actual situation in China, you must first understand the importance of this propaganda factor in the current situation in China.</p>
<p>Does the insidious and vicious nature of Communist propaganda still need to be explained to the American audience? For two years, you have been familiar with how the Communist Party has used its tricks in the United States. A loyal civil servant of the American government, who did not sign his real name, published an article in the October 20th issue of Reader's Digest, detailing how the Communist Party uses various methods to frame and coerce dissidents. After the Communist Party discovered the person's real name, they spread rumors of persecution, turning the residents of his city (I must remind you, this is in an American city) against him, even against his wife and children, forcing him to move to another state. After reading this news, I was surprised to find that this was exactly the same as the tactics of the Communist bandits in China; the methods are the same. Many misunderstandings in the United States about the situation in China are due to the Communist bandits and the Communist International distorting the facts.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist bandits, like Communists in other parts of the world, are experts in using propaganda to deceive the world. In order to damage the prestige of the government at home and abroad, they spare no effort to slander the President, myself, and members of our family. When our country resisted Japan, because resisting Japan happened to suit the Communist bandits' purposes, they praised us as heroes. But today, they attribute all the ills of China to us. Some gullible people in the country, as well as others who should have a clearer understanding, have unknowingly accepted these Communist bandits' false propaganda. It is painful to say. The latter are cowards, weak-willed, and accommodating. There are also those who hope to please the Communist bandits in order to escape disaster when the Communist bandits win. Everyone understands the speculators and wavering elements in previous wars, and unfortunately, China is not exempt from this type of person. But if the Communist bandits think that these propaganda tricks have weakened the will of the Chinese government, then their estimate is completely wrong. Now, I can assure American friends that, despite some disappointing events recently, the President and I have not been discouraged in the slightest. We are determined to continue to engage in the righteous war of suppressing the Communists, lest the country fall behind the Iron Curtain. Our will is now as strong and unwavering as when we began suppressing the Communists, and our belief in final victory is extremely strong. We feel that most of our lives have passed, and we only hope that God will bless us to continue to dedicate our remaining years to the work of building a free China. This is the work to which we have been consistently and faithfully devoted for the past twenty-five years. As long as the President and I have a breath left, we will resolutely fight to eliminate the threat of the evil Communist bandits. Even if we fail, we will have no regrets other than lamenting the brevity of life and dedicating this one life to serve the country. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] Madam Chiang Kai-shek's broadcast to the American people has received considerable attention from both the government and the public here. Some radio stations will rebroadcast the recording of Madam Chiang Kai-shek's speech for those who have not yet heard it. At the same time, the local morning newspapers will also publish the full text of Madam Chiang Kai-shek's speech in a prominent position. The front page of the New York Herald Tribune used a large-font headline to say: Madam Chiang Kai-shek appeals to the United States to provide assistance quickly, otherwise the Communist army will rampage in Asia. The New York Times also published Madam Chiang Kai-shek's speech on an inside page, with the headline: Madam Chiang Kai-shek asks the United States to provide further support in this struggle; if the United States hopes to contain the Communist military rule in Asia, it must rapidly aid China.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Principles for Handling Confiscated Goods <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>During the period of strengthened management, the quantity of materials confiscated due to general warehouse inspections, inventory declarations, and special reports is considerable. In addition to ongoing efforts to sort through and determine disposal methods, there are reportedly still many unresolved pending cases. The Committee for Handling Confiscated Goods has agreed upon principles for these pending cases and is starting to clear them up, which is naturally what everyone is eagerly hoping for.</p>
<p>Due to rising prices, some of these confiscated goods have actually benefited from their misfortune, gaining unexpected profits due to being "ordered to be hoarded." However, in general, the mental and material losses suffered by these depositors are a great source of pain. It is said that a certain owner of confiscated goods repeatedly appealed based on reason and was eventually granted a return. Overjoyed, he opened the warehouse to find that, due to the long time that had passed, most of the goods had spoiled and were no longer usable. He abandoned the list on the ground and left in despair. This illustrates the losses suffered by merchants. Originally, the durability of various goods varies, and there is more than one agency responsible for enforcement. By the time one stumbles around and finds an agency capable of handling the matter, and after going through procedures such as investigation, review, consultation, and decision-making, it is naturally not as simple as when the goods were confiscated. No wonder many goods with poor durability and improper storage conditions deteriorate and change.</p>
<p>Now that the handling principles have been decided, we naturally hope that they will be implemented promptly to avoid aggravating the losses of the owners. As for how to handle the procedures, we believe that the highest principle should still be the law.</p>
<p>In addition to the special laws for food, the most appropriate standards are the "Emergency Measures for Suppressing Hoarding of Daily Necessities During Times of Emergency," the "Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce," and the subsequent regulations and supplementary points issued by the ministry regarding the suppression of hoarding. According to these laws, the penalties and confiscations are specified in Articles 17 and 18 of the measures. The conditions for hoarding are defined as: (1) Daily necessities announced by the central and local governments according to law, categorized into five types: food, clothing, fuel, daily necessities, and other goods designated with approval. In other words, items not specifically designated above and not subject to legal announcement procedures should not be subject to the above laws. (2) The elements constituting hoarding are: (a) A person who is not engaged in commercial activities or a merchant not engaged in the business purchases and stores a large quantity of the aforementioned designated items; (b) A merchant engaged in the business purchases and stores the above-designated items and engages in hoarding behavior. Hoarding behavior is defined in this law as not selling in the market and raising prices above the legal profit stipulated by the local competent authority. Therefore, if the goods have already been sold on the market and the price increase does not exceed the legal profit, or if the local competent authority has not stipulated this legal profit, it should not be considered hoarding. As for the term "large quantity," the notes for attention clarify it as: (a) For direct consumer goods, anything exceeding the needs of each person for three months is considered a large quantity; (b) For business needs, anything exceeding one-fifth to one-third of the annual needs is considered a large quantity. The supplementary points stipulate that: If the goods are needed for the business of the merchant, they should not exceed one-quarter of the annual needs, except for seasonal items. According to this supplementary provision, it can be seen that: (1) The three-month limit only applies to personal consumer goods and does not apply to business needs; (2) The amount for business needs, whether one-quarter, one-fifth, or one-third of the annual needs, is clearly inconsistent and lacks a clear legal interpretation; (3) Seasonal items are not subject to the above one-fifth, one-quarter, or one-third restriction. Therefore, the common saying that goods hoarded for more than three months should be confiscated can only be regarded as a warning to hoarders. In fact, there is no corresponding legal basis for it.</p>
<p>As for goods confiscated because the quantity discovered during inspection or registration does not match, or is over-reported, under-reported, or the types and colors do not match, most of these are probably due to errors in the paperwork. Moreover, after registration, reports stated that the relevant authorities had ordered that sales should continue as usual and should not be refused on any pretext. Therefore, when conducting an on-site inspection after several days, the inventory may not match due to sales in compliance with the order or replenishment at any time, which is an unavoidable fact. If a confiscation penalty is imposed for this reason, it seems unfair and lacks a legal basis. It should be noted that when the registration was carried out, most people complied with the order to report, but a considerable number of people delayed registration. Moreover, at the beginning of the registration announcement, it seemed to only mention that it was for the purpose of understanding production and sales conditions or coordinating distribution. At that time, there was no prior warning that failure to report or over-reporting would result in confiscation. Therefore, we believe that it is excessive to retroactively implement overly strict measures, and those who refuse to comply with the registration are not affected, which is too advantageous for them.</p>
<p>We are not saying these words to defend a group of unscrupulous merchants. On the contrary, for those hoarders who are truly guilty, we also advocate for severe sanctions. However, any sanctions must be based on the law so that they will accept it willingly. If the circumstances are excusable or if the law does not provide a clear article to invoke, the goods should still be allowed to be returned or the punishment should be reduced to protect the rights of legitimate merchants. Now we have entered the constitutional stage, and various control laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertainty. What is considered a heinous crime today and should be severely punished may suddenly become a thing of the past tomorrow and be considered insignificant. There are many examples of this. As the ancients said, "If you understand the situation, be compassionate and do not rejoice." In this era of disorder, it seems that it is better to be lenient than to be excessive, which can maintain some public support!</p>

<p>Workers Vandalize Union Chairman's Residence</p>
<p>[Our Nantong Correspondent, 22nd] A partial labor strike suddenly occurred at the Dasheng No. 1 Factory in Nantong around 7:00 AM on the 22nd. The female workers felt that their indexed wages did not keep up with prices, and they also made informal requests for salary advances. After a week of brewing discontent, some female workers blocked the day shift from entering the factory outside the premises as the night shift was leaving this morning. Subsequently, the group went to the residence of Wang Qin, the chairman of the county's general labor union and concurrently the chairman of the factory's union, and vandalized clothing and furniture. They then dispersed in a rush. Local authorities, upon hearing the news, dispatched representatives to investigate the truth. According to the factory, workers' benefits, including indexed wages and rations, are handled according to Shanghai standards, so this incident must have been a misunderstanding. All those who caused the trouble were female workers. Only two-tenths of the workers came to the factory today, but work continued as usual. Once the truth is clarified, a reasonable resolution will be made.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Marshall Arrives in Washington Yesterday Afternoon; White House Meeting Reviews the Overall Situation; Concerned About the Situation in China and Considering New Policies <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Washington, 22nd Broadcast: Truman and Marshall are scheduled to meet at the White House today at 12:30 PM. An hour before the meeting began, Truman received a report from Harriman, the European Inspector of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stating that the United States' prestige abroad has greatly increased since the US election, and Europeans feel that liberalism is on the rise, enough to overwhelm reactionary forces.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall will meet today to review the development of foreign policy in the first phase after the election. This development will largely determine the fate of China and the future course of the United States' strategy against international communism.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman returned to Washington yesterday on the "Independence" aircraft from Key West, ending his two-week vacation in Florida to prepare to shoulder the heavy burdens of domestic and world affairs. Secretary of State Marshall is expected to fly from Paris to Washington this morning to hold an important meeting with the President to review the global situation. Truman will also meet with Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Harriman, the European Inspector of the Economic Cooperation Administration. The main issues facing the United States are as follows: (1) What form of control should be adopted for the Ruhr region, the industrial heart of Germany? In view of France's strong opposition to any return of the Ruhr to German control, President Truman's early decision on this matter is necessary. (2) Should the United States fully support the Chinese government in its war against the Communist forces? (3) How much military spending should be requested from Congress in the 1949 fiscal year, and how should this military spending be allocated? (4) How much funding should be allocated to the Economic Cooperation Administration in the second year? (5) The issue of the North Atlantic Defense Agreement. (6) Changes in cabinet personnel.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Responsible sources said today that President Truman will retain Marshall as Secretary of State for a considerable period of time during his meeting with Marshall today. Secretary of Defense Forrestal also seems likely to remain in office for several months. If Marshall remains in office, Under Secretary of State Lovett will also remain in his position.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] UN General Assembly President and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt said in a radio address to the United States today that there are now reasonable hopes that the Berlin stalemate can be resolved within the next three weeks (i.e., before the end of the UN General Assembly). The crux of the dispute between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France is a matter of timing, not a matter of principle.</p>
<p>The main issue is to find a timetable acceptable to all parties to lift the Berlin blockade and unify the Berlin currency. The Soviet Union requires both to proceed simultaneously, while the United States and Britain require the blockade to be lifted first before negotiations can begin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] Financial experts from the three Western powers held another meeting today to make final revisions to the three countries' response to the memorandum submitted by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia regarding the Berlin currency issue. Political observers predict that this response may be completed on the 23rd. Bramuglia has already received the Soviet Union's response and will compare it with the three Western powers' response to determine whether the Berlin currency unification issue can proceed simultaneously with the gradual lifting of the Berlin blockade.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Brussels, 21st] Well-informed sources have learned that while Italian Prime Minister Gasperi was stationed here, he had extensive talks with Spaak to discuss Italy's accession to the Brussels Pact. The two politicians also discussed issues relating to Italian-Belgian relations. However, this information has not been officially confirmed.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Belgrade, 21st] The Communist Intelligence Agency's campaign to overthrow Marshal Tito over the past four and a half months has completely failed. Tito and other leaders now have complete and confident control over Yugoslavia. The relationship between Yugoslavia and the Communist Intelligence Agency and Western countries has the following two important aspects: (1) As far as can be seen at present, Yugoslavia intends to move politically closer to the West. (2) Yugoslavia has not suffered any economic crisis threatened by the blockade imposed by Communist Intelligence Agency countries. The above two points are worthy of attention, as representatives from countries other than Britain and the United States have the opposite views and are understood to have reported these views to their respective governments.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 21st] The Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany is promoting a German-style "Stakhanov movement" to increase industrial production. Stakhanov was a Soviet miner who invented a new method of mining coal, producing far more than usual, and thus turned it into a production increase campaign. Germany's fake Stakhanov is a certain miner named Hennels, who looks like a counter-revolutionary. It is rumored that he personally dug out 380% more coal than the daily quota. Although this figure is exaggerated, it has been used by the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Continued Supply Would Cause Trouble</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] A spokesman for the US authorities here told the news media bluntly today that the US authorities no longer take into account the demands of General Eichelberger of the US Eighth Army, who previously supported Japan, and refuse the Japanese government's request to supply Japan with light weapons and ammunition. The US authorities believe that Japan "does not need to increase other armaments in addition to its existing armaments." Eaton, head of the Police Department of US Headquarters, said: The 120,000 Japanese police have 25,000 pistols for their use, and they have ample control over this number. He believes that there is no need to supply Japanese police with rifles and light machine guns again, because this matter may cause endless trouble.</p>

<p>[Our Report] London, 22nd Broadcast Berlin News: US intelligence personnel today confirmed the news reported by German newspapers that Soviet Western Army Commander Marshal Rokossovsky has established headquarters in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. The newspaper said that the headquarters is located in Mecklenburg, and Rokossovsky has moved to Mecklenburg from Insterburg in East Prussia. The newspaper also stated that the Soviet occupation forces in Germany have strengthened their strength, and at the same time, the Soviet Union is concentrating manpower and material resources in the hope of using strong actions to promote its political objectives. The US side does not particularly believe the rumors that the Soviet Union has increased its occupying forces. They also do not believe the rumors that Rokossovsky will replace Sokolovsky, the supreme commander of the Soviet forces in Germany.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] The Soviet Union today in the United Nations Political Committee accused Britain and the United States of doing their best to turn Palestine into a tool for their military policies and "their oil feuds." Soviet representative Tsarapkin rejected the Bernadotte Plan and accused Britain of manipulating Palestine by merging the Arab state in the Holy Land with Transjordan. He claimed that Britain and the United States are using "pressure" to change the United Nations General Assembly's partition plan. Tsarapkin said that the United Nations should order all foreign troops to withdraw from the Holy Land, obviously referring to the Arab armies now in Palestine. He continued, "If there were no Anglo-American conspiracies, there would be two independent countries in Palestine today without bloodshed."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] Britain and the United States agreed on the 21st to try to eliminate their differences on the Palestinian issue in a secret meeting, so that they could adopt a biblically consistent line on Holy Land policy before the UN Political Committee votes on the issue. British and American experts are now preparing to exchange views and find common ground to avoid the continuation of the deadlock in the committee. The United States apparently wants to let the Arab and Jewish representatives negotiate directly, and the United Nations need not give detailed instructions. But Britain supports the recommendations of mediator Bernadotte to revise the Arab-Jewish border in the original partition plan.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] The heads of delegations from the countries of the Far Eastern Commission went to MacArthur's headquarters at 11:35 AM today to discuss the punishment of Japanese war criminals by the International Military Tribunal, which lasted for 30 minutes. After the meeting, MacArthur's headquarters issued a statement stating, "MacArthur met with the Allied Control Council for Japan and the representatives of the countries of the Far Eastern Commission this morning to review the International Tribunal's decisions.

Only the head of the Indian delegation, Kakalavati, supported the opinion of the Indian representative to the International Tribunal, Bal, and expressed dissenting views. Shang said that the representatives of each country expressed their views in one or two brief sentences. However, MacArthur himself did not say a word at today's meeting, so there was no hint in the meeting as to when the Allied Headquarters could complete the review of the court's judgment. Soviet delegation leader and Allied Control Council representative Terlefyanko also attended the meeting today, but remained silent throughout, only saying a few words to express his full support for the court's judgment.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Japanese Diet Decides to Dissolve After Amendment to Civil Service Law Passes; Prime Minister Yoshida Announces at Press Conference <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida, when hosting reporters on the afternoon of the 22nd, stated in strong terms that the cabinet is determined to dissolve the Diet. Yoshida said: "The Diet could have been dissolved originally, but the amendment to the Civil Service Law and other important bills could not be discussed and passed, so we endured it temporarily, hoping that all important bills could be passed during the session. The Liberal Party has absolute confidence in seizing power in the next general election. The next general election may be held within this year.</p>
<p>As for the issue of rectifying discipline, it has nothing to do with whether the Diet is dissolved. The current cabinet is determined to implement it thoroughly and will not allow similar Showa Denko incidents to happen in Japanese political circles again. After Japanese politics establish credibility internationally, foreign investment can naturally be introduced to participate in Japan's economic recovery work. In the future, if the House of Representatives again obstructs discussions on the supplementary budget bill and the amendment to the Civil Service Law, an emergency meeting of the House of Councillors will be convened to discuss the supplementary budget bill based on the new salary standards, so that it will be passed in the House of Councillors first."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Portland, Oregon, 22nd] The 10th Congress of the US Industrial Organizations Federation opened here on the 22nd. General attention is focused on the conflict between the left and right wings. Federation Chairman Murray, a key figure in the right-leaning majority, released a 107-page annual report on the evening of the 21st, predicting the path of the Congress on many issues. From his remarks, the seriousness of the conflict can be seen. He proposed an eight-point economic plan, advocating the restoration of price controls and excessive profit taxes. There is nothing in the report that would provoke opposition from the 700 delegates, as most of it does not mention the issues in dispute between the left and right wings, although the above issues are the most important in the eyes of many delegates. Some radical anti-communist representatives hope to expel left-leaning unions. Other delegates have suggested methods to force left-wing unions to abide by the policies of the majority. Still others advocate removing Vice Chairman Figula, the only left-winger among the nine vice-chairmen and a supporter of Wallace's Progressive Party.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Municipal Council Holds Symposium to Discuss Total War; Speaker Pan Vigorously Condemns Defeatism, Urges Colleagues to Help Stabilize Public Morale; Make All Citizens Unite and Defend Themselves to Become a Bastion of Safeguarding Democratic Politics <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held a symposium at its Tanggu Road headquarters at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss total war and the valuation of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company. The attendees included Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiguang, and 119 councilors. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and more than 30 city government officials attended. Speaker Pan presided over the symposium, delivered the opening remarks. Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan successively reported on the current problems in Shanghai, the issue of total war, and the implementation of the total war program. Subsequently, Councilors Jiang Hao, Zhang Zhihan, Shi Zongde, Fei Duesheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhou Xiangsheng, Wu Zheng, Ji Hao, Yu Shun, Yan Esheng, and Jiang Haoran spoke one after another. The symposium adjourned at 6:30 PM. The meeting passed the following three points: (1) The various opinions on the issue of total war will be recorded by the General Assembly Secretariat and sent to the municipal government and the garrison headquarters for reference. Councilors who did not have the opportunity to speak due to time constraints can submit their opinions in writing to the General Assembly, which will forward them to the municipal government and the garrison headquarters. (2) Regarding the issue of tax collection in the city after the price limits are lifted, the municipal government should consider collecting taxes without changing the tax rate. (3) Regarding the issue of valuation and stock offering of the Public Transportation Company, due to time constraints, it was decided that the municipal government should consider a solution, and the council will organize a subcommittee to review it first.</p>
<p>The various opinions expressed by Speaker Pan, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and the councilors are recorded below:</p>
<p>Speaker Pan delivered the opening remarks, stating in brief: The seventh session of this council adjourned on September 15th. At that time, the city was strictly implementing price controls, and the superficial appearance of society seemed to be the most stable period in recent years. However, in no time, due to strict management in Shanghai and relaxation in other areas, the price control policy failed. Initially, there was a rush to purchase and hoarding of goods that were not sold, followed by the government abandoning price controls, and prices soared like a runaway horse, but there was still no supply at the set prices. On the other hand, due to the reversal of the military situation in the suppression of bandits, after several famous cities in the Northeast and Henan-Shandong were abandoned one after another, the focus of the war has shifted to the Xuzhou area in northern Jiangsu. Under the mutual stimulation of this economic phenomenon and military situation, the morale of the rear cities, especially the Nanjing-Shanghai area, inevitably became volatile. In addition, Communist Party infiltrators seized the opportunity to fabricate rumors, causing unnecessary turmoil in the entire society. An atmosphere of defeatism gradually spread, and even many intellectuals and social leaders were more or less poisoned by the Communist Party's propaganda offensive and were oppressed by the Communist Party's psychological warfare, believing that the government's power would be difficult to sustain. Not only did very few people use a calm mind to consider the consequences of success or failure, or that this war is an anti-aggression and anti-totalitarian war related to world peace and national security, and then lead by example to raise the awareness of the general public, to correct international perspectives, but some people even echoed "peace rumors." If it were not for the President's decisive command, with unwavering will, to sternly refute them, the current situation would be difficult to imagine. Gongzhan believes that the key to the success or failure of suppressing the rebellion is that military affairs and popular morale are equally important. The gain or loss of a city or a pool in military affairs may not be enough to affect the overall situation, and the key to success or failure is entirely in our own minds. A single cry at night, the preservation of the desire for destruction, the song of Chu on all sides, and the defeat at Gaixia, such historical traces that can be picked up at any time, everywhere can illustrate that the psychology of defeatism is absolutely unacceptable. Here, I cannot help but point out that in the three years of the Communist Party's rebellion, the government has always been unwilling to abandon the promotion of democratic politics and has strived to maintain the "normal state." This painstaking effort should be worthy of our love, but the Communist Party has taken advantage of this opportunity to allow infiltrators to penetrate into all levels of society, creating all kinds of incidents, disrupting social order, hindering social stability, and disturbing people's minds to the extreme. The military movements on the front lines are certainly sufficient to affect the morale of the rear, and the volatility of the morale of the rear is even more sufficient to dissipate the morale of the front lines. We should resolutely stop this floating phenomenon from recurring. If what I have said above is not wrong, then my colleagues in this council, in today's difficult situation and social turmoil, should take assisting the government and stabilizing people's hearts as the first priority, so that all Shanghai citizens can unite strongly and defend themselves, and become a great fortress for safeguarding China's democratic politics. What Gongzhan wants to reiterate today is that the authorities are studying how to implement a wartime cabinet, and each war zone has gradually strengthened the total war measures under the common goal of military first and bandit suppression above all else.</p>
<p>Please Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan Explain the Total War System</p>
<p>The Nanjing-Shanghai area has recently been designated as a garrison area, and military, political, economic, and even social activities and personal lives will be placed under the form of a total war plan for reform. The general public in this city is still not fully aware of the content of the total war system. Today, I would like to ask Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan to give us instructions on the spot. However, Gongzhan believes that in order to achieve the victory of bandit suppression and military affairs, and to strive for the independence and freedom of the nation and nation, in this serious period of correcting chaos and returning to normal, the people cannot but temporarily sacrifice a part of their personal freedom, abandon certain aspects of certain interests, and accept certain extraordinary constraints. In other words, we should fully endure everything stipulated in the martial law. In terms of government administration, perhaps some departments must be coordinated with military operations, and even placed under the unified command of the military, which is also expected. Whether councilors of this council are elected by regional or professional groups, or selected by parties, they are all representatives of all citizens of the city. Under the implementation of the total war system, what work should we do and how should we complete our tasks? These are all things that are worth our deep consideration. At the same time, I also hope that our military and political authorities can appreciate that Shanghai is China's premier city, and that its reactions are very sensitive in terms of politics, economy, society, and culture. All movements in Shanghai are especially sufficient to affect the whole country. When necessary, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of all plans and to ensure that they are in line with the public opinion, they should be able to give the public opinion representatives of this council, within certain limits, the opportunity to deliberate and contribute, so that our usual insights and knowledge, and the wisdom and ability of each person, can be used to do something for the country and the local area. I believe this should be a basic condition for my colleagues in this council to fulfill their duties.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Appeal to Citizens to Rush to Raise Funds to Protect Their Hometowns, Lives, and Property <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, "Finance is the mother of all administrations." If the city's treasury income cannot be sufficient, all plans for municipal facilities will be equivalent to empty words. The current situation is difficult and close to desperation, and the financial difficulties of the city have reached an extreme. My colleagues in this council have the responsibility to supervise the city's finances, and at the same time have a moral obligation to help the municipal authorities solve their financial difficulties. We certainly hope that the municipal authorities will reduce some unnecessary expenses, especially today, there should be no more wasteful expenses to beautify the situation. However, several major events in front of us, such as the start-up costs and provisions for the establishment of the Garrison Brigade and the Self-Defense Corps, and the salaries of the city's police officers, teachers, and staff, all require financial resources to be injected. Regarding the Garrison Brigade and the Self-Defense Corps, they are the local self-defense forces that this council has long hoped for. Gongzhan remembers that at the opening of the fifth session of this council at the beginning of this year, he called on the citizens of the city to rush to raise funds and train local forces to assist the national army in defending their hometowns, to use local salaries and funds to support local militias, and to use local militias to protect local lives and property for the sake of the city's security. Today, what we are asking for is exactly the same. The citizens of the city, especially wealthy merchants and big businessmen, must be vigilant about the ancient训"Under a toppled nest, there are no intact eggs," and generously donate as much as possible under the goal of "everything for bandit suppression and everything for military affairs" to fully cultivate the local forces in the city. As for how to improve the treatment of police officers, teachers, and staff so that they can maintain a low standard of living, it is also a serious issue at present. To hope that the soldiers will bravely kill the enemy, they must have elite troops and sufficient food, and their horses must be full and well-fed. To hope that the police officers, teachers, and staff can serve with peace of mind and work hard in their posts, their income must be sufficient to support their families. The military and police are the pillars of the country, and the teachers and staff are the backbone of society, and their positions are equally important. This point, I believe, all my colleagues in this council can understand. However, how to find new sources of income is indeed an important topic at present. We would like to ask Mayor Wu to express his views. But in any case, according to our calculations, if several items in the city's taxes can be properly adjusted in accordance with the dynamic adjustment of prices, the salaries of police officers, teachers, and staff can be barely covered. And for the expenditure on the establishment of local forces, opening up financial resources is unavoidable. The financial resources that are opened up should not only be able to be dynamically adjusted in accordance with prices, but also hope that they will come from the principle of having money to contribute. Only when we truly "have money to contribute and effort to contribute" can we suppress the Communist bandits and protect the security of this city and even our country.</p>
<p>Do Not Miss the Current Opportunity</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to reiterate, but it is also the most important point, is that this symposium of this council is being held at the time when the Battle of Xuzhou has just ended victoriously. This period of time is worthy of our rejoicing and even more worthy of our treasure. Why do I say this? The great victory of the Battle of Xuzhou can be called a turning point in our country's survival. The military results of this great victory were to defeat 200,000 Communist bandits and protect hundreds of miles of mountains and rivers in Jianghuai. The political, economic, and international benefits were even greater. When the good news came, not only did people's hearts cheer up and prices plummet, but it also changed the views of the US government and the public towards our government, which is sufficient to have a great impact on the work of aiding China. These are indeed rare signs in recent years. We should make good use of this precious opportunity, learn from the pain, investigate the root causes of the past failures of the country, and make some efforts to re-establish the government's lost prestige, seek reforms in political affairs, and start anew with the people. Only then will the country have hope, and only then will we gain more support, and US aid will come without being expected, and it will be strengthened without being expected. The motivation for this council to convene this plenary symposium was originally due to the case of the asset valuation of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company, which had to wait for everyone to review it today. However, at a time of difficult situations and social turmoil, several important issues have to take advantage of this rare gathering to exchange opinions with each other in order to contribute to the country. Gongzhan is worried about the difficult times and is deeply moved. The above is inevitable, and I am not careful in my words. I hope that my colleagues will give me more advice.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Yangtze River is a Natural Barrier That Bandits Cannot Easily Cross; Mayor Wu Calls on People to Defend Greater Shanghai <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech: The most serious problems in Shanghai at present are three: (1) The food problem: The current rice panic has passed, rice is coming in steadily, and the price of rice has fallen to about 400 yuan, and it is expected that there will be no more major fluctuations. (2) Wage problem: The compilation of the index for the first half of November is absolutely correct. The reason why workers are not satisfied is that at that time, it was rumored that the price of rice was 2,000 yuan per dan, so it could not be listed as a standard. The current labor-capital disputes are being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, etc., and can be gradually resolved. (3) Financial problem: This is the most difficult problem to deal with at present. The lives of public school teachers and staff are extremely difficult, but the city government's income and expenditure cannot be balanced. The city government hopes that the council will assist in how to adjust taxes to seek a balance of income and expenditure. As for the total war problem, the detailed measures will be reported by Commander Xuan. I personally think that the people who flee to Hong Kong are the most foolish. If the Communist bandits attack southern China, Hong Kong will inevitably become an isolated bird in two months. Where will the people of Hong Kong flee to then?</p>
<p>Shanghai has factories, banks, and foreign exchange, and its wealth is enough to support an army of 150,000. Moreover, the Huangpu River is a natural boundary. Defense strongholds are set up in the river, and the Communist bandits cannot attack. As long as Shanghai can hold on for a month, it can lay the foundation for victory. If it can hold on for two months, it can gain the sympathy of countries around the world. If it can hold on for three months, friendly countries will naturally provide us with a large amount of military supplies. Therefore, as long as the people of Shanghai have the determination, the courage, eliminate the mentality of fleeing, cooperate with each other, and jointly defend Greater Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Commander Xuan Reports on the Main Points of Total War <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Commander Xuan said in his speech: The total war in the Songhu area will be jointly supervised by the heads of local party, government, military, council, and other relevant agencies to organize a committee. The main points of its implementation are (1) Military Department: Efforts should be made to enrich the forces. Whether it is the Garrison Brigade, the Security Regiment, the Security Police, or the People's Self-Defense Force, they must be actively trained to strengthen local forces. The replenishment of troops and sources of soldiers should be improved. Fortunately, there is the natural and solid Huangpu River, which can protect Shanghai. (2) Political Department: Strengthen the organization of district offices, town offices, and security offices, investigate households and ships on the Huangpu River, so that Communist Party members cannot infiltrate, severely punish corruption, strictly implement assessments, rectify political discipline, and all eligible young men must serve, and organize children's teams and women's teams to mobilize the people as a whole. (3) The economic department should also be improved, because the Communist bandits are using economic reform as an offensive strategy. We should improve ourselves first, and then we can attack them. We must win over the people, train the people, and use the people, and use the entire strength of the people to eliminate the Communist bandits.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Senior Officials' Families Flee to Hong Kong; Councilors Criticize One After Another <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Councilors' Opinions: (1) Jiang Hao: The people absolutely support the government. The various facts in the past are enough to prove that the people have not let the government down. It is only the government that has let the people down. It is not only the Communist bandits who are creating rumors, but also senior government officials. They tell the people not to flee, but their own families slip away first. At this critical juncture, the government itself must not have factional struggles, and should sincerely cooperate to save the critical situation. (2) Zhang Zhihan: During the implementation of total war, the army must strictly abide by discipline and must not disturb the people everywhere, and then we can talk about military-civilian cooperation. (3) Shi Zongde: Senior government officials sing the praises of defending the land, while their own families flee first. We hope that the local government will be stricter in checking whether there are any senior government officials among the travelers to Hong Kong. (4) Fei Shusheng: The mayor and Commander Xuan said that they are determined to defend Shanghai with the Huangpu River as the boundary. We are determined to follow the mayor and commander to jointly defend Shanghai. However, for the families of senior government officials who have fled to Hong Kong, we should tell them to return to Shanghai immediately, otherwise their property in Shanghai will be confiscated and their official positions will be revoked. The Communist bandits' propaganda newspapers and periodicals should be banned from entering the country, and the distorted broadcasts from Hong Kong should also be interfered with by radio waves so that the citizens cannot listen to them. (5) Zhang Zhongyuan: The families of Wang Yunwu and Wang Shijie not only fled to Hong Kong, but also fled to the United States. For this group of people, the government should immediately expel them from their nationality. The city should strive for social stability and sufficient food. (6) Zhou Xiangsheng: In fact, Hong Kong is not a comfortable place. It is an isolated island surrounded by water. Once it is bombed, there is no place to take refuge. (7) Wu Zheng: The mayor expressed his admiration for Yan Xishan's defense of Taiyuan. We hope that the mayor can also learn from him and express his views, and would rather make Shanghai his burial place and never leave Shanghai. (8) Ji Hao: Everyone must not have the mentality of fleeing. (9) Yu Shun: The government's policies must not change frequently, so that the people's hearts can be stabilized, industry and commerce can be normal, and the local area can be defended. (10) Yan Esheng: We should organize a review committee to review whether those who go to Hong Kong have the necessity to do so. For those who go purely to flee, each person should be limited to donating 2,000 yuan to be used as a refugee relief fund in the city. As for the business tax, we hope to reduce the donation rate to maintain the difficulties of the merchants. (11) Jiang Haoran: Central politics and local politics should be coordinated, and everything should be done according to local conditions and according to people. The young men drafted in Shanghai should not be sent to Taiwan, but should defend the local area in Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The matter of private schools increasing tuition fees has caused resentment among parents due to the rigid requirements and threats regarding enrollment. Many parents have refused to pay, and some schools have even suspended classes. It is reported that private elementary school teachers have held meetings to discuss the increased tuition fees.

The attitude of private middle school teachers has not yet been decided, and the authorities are currently mediating.</p>

<p>Municipal elementary school teachers and staff have also decided to resume work today after taking leave. The Municipal Elementary School Teachers' Association held a meeting of directors, supervisors, and representatives from various schools at 3:00 PM yesterday in the fifth district's first center, with over 200 people attending. Director Li of the Education Bureau went to persuade them, claiming that the China Textile Company had responded to the issue of allocating woolen cloth and asked them to register immediately and determine the required quantity. Two-thirds of the teachers and staff can be allocated serge, while the remaining one-third can be allocated uniform woolen cloth. School workers can be allocated Four Gentlemen Drill, three yards per person, with the price calculated according to the listed price, which is about one-third cheaper than the market price. The Education Bureau is currently negotiating, hoping that the allocated price can be even cheaper. Approximately 9,000 pounds of woolen yarn can be allocated to municipal elementary and middle school teachers and staff, averaging one pound per person, priced at 9.60 yuan. Schools can submit payments to the Education Bureau before the 25th. The municipal government is also planning a method for distributing confiscated coal and cigarettes. Rice rations for December can be distributed early. Regarding the treatment of public school teachers and staff, if the Executive Yuan decides to increase it fivefold, the municipal government will supplement it as soon as the official documents arrive. It is hoped that all teachers and staff will understand the difficulties of the times and resume work immediately. The teachers and staff then expressed their opinions, with some advocating for resuming classes and others advocating for continuing the collective leave. Finally, it was voted to resume work across the board from today. In addition to sending a telegram to the central government to quickly seek a fundamental solution, it is hoped that the municipal government will expedite the allocation of supplies.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister of Education Zhu Jia-hua, accompanied by Secretary Fang Zhimou, arrived in Shanghai on the 21st and returned to Beijing by night train last night.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Minister Zhu convened a meeting at the Academia Sinica with the presidents of public and private universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools in the city. More than 40 people attended, including Zhang Yi, Wang Zhijiu, Xia Jianbai, Zhu Guozhang, Zhu Hengbi, Sheng Zhenwei, Ou Yuanhuai, Hu Dunfu, Gu Yuqi, Liao Shicheng, Wang Yukai, and Chu Fengyi. The meeting refused to allow reporters to attend. After the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, Minister Zhu also refused to speak with reporters. It is reported that during the meeting, Minister Zhu provided a detailed analysis of the overall situation, explaining that the suppression of the rebellion is related to the survival of the nation and the individual. The government is determined to quell the banditry and will see it through to the end. He hoped that people in the education sector would work together to support national policies. Minister Zhu expressed his appreciation for the hard work of colleagues in various schools who continued to work diligently and proceeded as usual despite the recent turbulent situation and public anxiety. Minister Zhu expressed his concern about the impact of recent price fluctuations and the living conditions and financial situation of teachers and staff in various schools. Minister Zhu believes that the funding for national institutions can be improved after being readjusted, and the procedures for transferring funds will be expedited as much as possible to meet urgent needs. Minister Zhu stated that the ministry has always been very concerned about subsidies for private institutions. However, due to budget limitations, the allocated subsidies can only express the central government's encouragement and concern. Private institutions are currently facing more financial difficulties than before, and special funds will be allocated for subsidies.</p>
<p>Presidents Zhang Yi, Wang Zhizhuo, Xia Jianbai, Zhou Junshi, and Li Xinyang spoke successively at the meeting, reporting on the situation of various schools in detail, and expressed that colleagues in the education sector are determined to adhere to their original intentions and remain steadfast in their positions so that school affairs can become more stable. As for the allocation of education funds, it is hoped that the national treasury can make emergency payments so that urgent needs can be met at any time, avoiding the impact of currency devaluation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Various private colleges and universities in the city previously decided to increase tuition and miscellaneous fees or take an early vacation due to drastic price fluctuations and economic difficulties. Yesterday afternoon, the presidents of various private colleges and universities raised this issue for discussion at Minister Zhu's tea party. It was generally believed that increasing tuition fees would impose too much burden on students, and taking an early vacation would affect students' studies. The presidents of various schools then proposed two requests: (1) Please allow the Central Bank to overdraft 5 million gold yuan, to be distributed evenly among the schools. The schools will mortgage school property, guaranteed by the Ministry of Education, and repay it at the beginning of the next semester. (2) Private school teachers and staff should enjoy the same in-kind distribution rights as public school teachers and staff to stabilize their lives. In addition to expressing that he had requested the central government to allocate special funds for subsidies, Minister Zhu promised to work hard to implement the two requests. After the tea party, the presidents of various schools exchanged opinions on this matter. Since the early vacation period is not far away, the principle will still be that each school decides based on its own situation.</p>
<p>[Another Report] President Ou of Daxia University told reporters that the second tuition fee increase will not be implemented, and the school decided to maintain operations until the end of December, taking a two-week early vacation compared to the original school calendar. In addition, St. John's University does not adopt mandatory regulations for the second tuition fee increase. Vice President Bu Qiji informed the parents of each student to voluntarily donate, with the goal of raising a total of 200,000 gold yuan for maintenance expenses, to be paid before December 20.</p>

Fortunately, he was discovered and rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The military tribunal has scheduled the re-trial of Japanese war criminal General Okamura Yasuji, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese dispatched army to China, for 10:00 AM on the 30th of this month. To save expenses, the trial will be held at the original location of the tribunal at the end of North Sichuan Road. All sectors are welcome to attend. On August 23, Okamura Yasuji was publicly tried by the military tribunal at the Municipal Council Hall. The prosecutor and the defense attorney engaged in fierce debate.

The evidence has now been investigated, and the debate will resume on the 30th, possibly concluding in one session.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the price increases in the barber, hotel, and bathhouse industries are too high. A few days ago, it strictly ordered the three industries to automatically reduce prices to an index standard of eight times one. Yesterday, representatives from the Hotel Industry Association went to the Social Affairs Bureau to meet with Director Wu Kaixian, stating the heavy business expenses and the difficulty of not increasing room rates, requesting permission to maintain the status quo. It is reported that Director Wu did not consider the industry's request and has instructed the relevant department to draft measures for banning and enforcement.</p>

<h3 id="e97">China Textile Plans to Move Spindles to Taiwan and Guangdong; First Batch Set at 50,000 to 70,000 <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Regarding China Textile's decision to move some spindles to Taiwan and Guangdong, our reporter learned that the reason for the move is that there is a strong need for yarn and cloth in these two places. However, the yarn factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai are facing a large number of spindles that have stopped operating due to a shortage of raw cotton and power. Rather than abandoning them, they would be better utilized by moving them elsewhere. Therefore, in principle, it has been decided to list a portion of the 75,000 spindles that have stopped operating in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai as the first batch to be moved to Taiwan. However, there is also a shortage of power in Taiwan, and efforts are being made to improve it. Before the power problem is resolved, only 30,000 to 40,000 spindles will be moved temporarily. 20,000 to 30,000 spindles will be moved to Guangdong.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Tailoring Industry Dispute; Directors and Supervisors Petition <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>All the directors and supervisors of the Tailoring Industry Association went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to petition. During the price-controlled period, the wage per suit was 13 yuan. The employers, thinking of the workers' livelihoods, provided an additional subsidy of 5 yuan per suit. However, after the index was announced this time, the workers still demanded that the 5 yuan subsidy be calculated according to the cost-of-living index, which the employers refused to do. The workers are now skimping on the work for the suits they make. They brought suits as evidence when petitioning yesterday, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that this lacks work ethic and has decided to convene a meeting of labor and management for mediation this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Trial Opens for the Case of Impersonating a Garrison Department Official and Raping a Dance Hostess; Cai Meizhen Narrates the Details of the Harm While Weeping <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Feng, who impersonated a staff member of the Garrison Headquarters and raped dance hostess Cai Meizhen with a gun, was brought to trial by Judge Wang Kanghou of the District Court at 4:00 PM yesterday. In addition to the victim, Cai Meizhen, a dance hostess at the Xinhua Dance Hall, Shi Weiren, a staff member of the Xinhua Dance Hall, Zhu Shunjia, a foreman, Yuan Shishan, a foreman at the Venus Dance Hall, and Ding Dasheng, a bookkeeper at the Nanjing Hotel, were also summoned to court to testify. The victim, Cai Meizhen, is only seventeen years old, and was dressed plainly. She narrated the details of the harm she suffered while weeping. According to her, she met the defendant before September 4. He called himself a staff member of the Garrison Headquarters and often brought a handgun into the venue. She was afraid to speak out because of his power and did not dare to say anything. On the evening of September 4, the defendant invited her out to dinner. After dinner, he insisted that she go with him to the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road to dance. Three others, including a friend of the defendant and a dance hostess from a famous dance hall in Shanghai, were already there. They danced until 1:00 AM. The defendant initially wanted her to row a sampan on the Huangpu River on the Bund, and then forced her and the other three to rest briefly at Room 30 of the Nanjing Hotel. Soon, his friend and the dance hostess from Shanghai left. The defendant locked the door and raped her three times with a gun. About two hours later, his two friends came again, as well as the tea server on the third floor of the hotel, and persuaded her not to cry. She was heartbroken and left in anger. Witnesses Shi Weiren, Zhu Shunjia, and Yuan Shishan successively testified that the defendant often went to the dance hall to dance, claimed to work at the Garrison Headquarters, and did not pay for tea or dance tickets. Ding Dasheng, the bookkeeper at the Nanjing Hotel, said that the defendant had often used the name "Liu Zhong" to book rooms at the hotel for three or four months before the incident, and each time he brought a woman to stay with him. The rest of his testimony matched the victim's account. When questioned, the defendant Yan Feng flatly denied the rape. The court ordered the police to escort the victim to identify and summon the dance hostess from the famous dance hall in Shanghai, whom she only knew by sight but did not know her name, as she was crucial to the case. The court then adjourned the trial to a later date, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Central Bank Implements New Foreign Exchange Transaction Management Measures Yesterday; Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Issued by Designated Banks Can be Exchanged for Foreign Telegraphic or Mail Transfers <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] New measures for managing foreign exchange transactions began to be implemented yesterday. The Central Bank yesterday notified all designated banks with a circular numbered One One Six Zero that all foreign exchange transactions should be handled in accordance with the following regulations starting immediately:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign exchange earned from the export of goods should be transferred to the Central Bank through designated banks, and the designated banks will issue foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign exchange remitted to the country by Chinese expatriates abroad (including all remittances from abroad) should be transferred to the Central Bank through their designated banks, and the designated banks will issue foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value, or directly sold to the Central Bank or its designated banks at the market price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate on that day.</p>
<p>(3) Foreign exchange transfer certificates can be exchanged for foreign telegraphic or mail transfers at the Central Bank or its designated banks for the following purposes: (A) Payment for imported goods for which import permits have been issued by the Import Management Committee, (B) Foreign exchange needs for "non-imported goods" approved by the government.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign exchange transfer certificates can be freely bought and sold by designated banks or foreign exchange brokers. The validity period for foreign exchange payment with the transfer certificate is 20 days.</p>
<p>(5) Expired transfer certificates must be sold to the Central Bank or its designated banks. The exchange rate for the sale will be based on the lowest market price on the last day of the validity period.</p>
<p>(6) In the circulars previously issued by the Central Bank to various designated banks, if the clauses contradict the provisions of this circular, the latter shall prevail.</p>
<p>Procedure for Designated Banks to Handle Foreign Exchange Transfers</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the implementation of the "Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate" method, the Central Bank issued Circular No. 161 to designated banks yesterday to provide explanations. The full text consists of eleven points, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Designated banks must issue foreign exchange transfer certificates only after receiving foreign exchange. The issuance of this certificate should be done with linked numbers.</p>
<p>(2) The foreign exchange received from issuing transfer certificates must be transferred to the Central Bank after the end of business hours on the same day, together with the second copy of the transfer certificate.</p>
<p>(3) Foreign exchange may be transferred to the Central Bank in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. However, the Central Bank's payment of foreign exchange for the transfer certificate will depend on whether the local designated bank has foreign exchange deposited with the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(4) Designated banks may, at the request of the customer, issue one or more transfer certificates for the foreign exchange received, but the total amount of foreign exchange may not be different, and other key points may not be changed.</p>
<p>(5) The foreign exchange transfer certificate is a four-part form. The original is issued to the customer by the designated bank, the copy is retained by the designated bank for reference, the third copy is handed over to the Central Bank together with the foreign exchange, and the fourth copy is submitted to the Central Bank together with the designated bank's transaction report.</p>
<p>Management of Transfer Certificates is More Flexible and Simple than Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Designated Banks Association held a temporary member meeting at the Bank of China at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Representatives from 28 member banks, including the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, Citibank, and HSBC, attended. Chairman Chen Changtong first reported the contents of the three circulars of 160, 161, and 162 related to foreign exchange management by Shao Zenghua, Wu Changbin, etc., and explained them point by point. Then, a meeting was held immediately to discuss and decide on the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign exchange transactions will resume from today (23rd).</p>
<p>(2) The foreign exchange transaction fee remains at 1.25%.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of a designated bank, the nature of the foreign exchange transfer certificate is very similar to the foreign exchange settlement certificate before the currency change. However, the management method is more flexible and simple than before. The former had a term of seven days, while the latter is extended to two months. The former had a distinction between "ordinary" and "special," while the latter does not. Therefore, the transaction of foreign exchange transfer certificates in the future will not be subject to time and quantity controls, and can fully reflect the needs of the market, resulting in a natural level of market price. It can technically facilitate the promotion of import and export trade, and it is also very helpful for attracting remittances from overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Regulations on the Ratio of Various Foreign Currencies to Gold Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issuance of the Gold Yuan Amendment Regulations and the new measures for managing foreign exchange, the Central Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 161 to various designated banks, stipulating the exchange rate of various foreign currencies to Gold Yuan as follows:</p>
<p>US Dollar 1 = Gold Yuan 20</p>
<p>British Pound 1 = Gold Yuan 60</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dollar 1 = Gold Yuan 3.75</p>
<p>Rupee 1 = Gold Yuan 4.50</p>
<p>Peso 1 = Gold Yuan 10</p>
<p>The Central Bank stipulates that all foreign exchange transfer certificates should only state the US dollar amount. When transferring non-US dollar foreign exchange, designated banks must issue foreign exchange transfer certificates according to the following exchange rates:</p>
<p>British Pound 1 = US Dollar 3</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dollar 1 = US Dollar 0.1875</p>
<p>叨 Dollar 1 = US Dollar 0.35</p>
<p>Rupee 1 = US Dollar 0.225</p>
<p>Swiss Franc 1 = US Dollar 0.25</p>
<p>Peso 1 = US Dollar 0.50</p>
<p>The Central Bank may change the above ratios at any time by notifying them through circulars when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Nearly 10,000 Stones of Rice Arrive on the Market; Rice Prices Fall Again <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was an enthusiastic arrival of rice, and the registered arrival volume in the two markets reached a new high. 2,952 stones, 7 dou, and 5 sheng arrived in the Nanshi market, and 6,752 stones arrived in the Beishi market, totaling 9,709 stones, 7 dou, and 5 sheng.</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, the surge in rice in the city is actually because the rice price in other ports is much lower than in the city. Along the Beijing-Shanghai line, the rice price in each county does not exceed 300 yuan, while the rice price in the city is close to 500 yuan for white japonica rice. Grain merchants are going to the production areas to sell rice in Shanghai due to the profit to be made, resulting in the largest arrival volume in three months.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market situation showed that prices continued to weaken. Market quotations were 450 yuan for white japonica rice in Nanshi, 480 yuan in Beishi, 456 yuan for thin indica rice in Nanshi, 470 yuan in Beishi, 450 yuan for early rice in Nanshi, 430 yuan in Beishi, and 450 yuan for Yangxian rice in both markets. However, actual transactions were around 420-430 yuan for white japonica rice, a further drop of 60-80 yuan compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Affected by the drop in rice prices, the market atmosphere also turned sluggish. The opening and closing price of the "Warship" brand flour was 150 yuan, and the transaction was not active. Old Che flour was 160 yuan, down 5 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour uniformly turned weak, down 6-7 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Continued to decline. The opening price of the local factory's soybean oil was 730 yuan, and the closing price fell to 720 yuan, a drop of 60 yuan compared to yesterday's market. The local factory's rapeseed oil was 600 yuan, and the Zhongzhi factory's rapeseed oil was 580 yuan, a significant drop.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Arrival volume surged, and customers were eager to sell for cash. Immediate transactions were generally sluggish. Qidong corn was 140 yuan, Hankou green beans were 175 yuan, white sesame seeds were stable, and raw peanuts were down 30-40 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Southern Transportation Ban Lifted, Buying Interest Strong, Yarn Prices Rise Across the Board <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market experienced a surge in prices due to positive news such as increased consolidated taxes and the lifting of the southern transportation ban. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn once soared to 11,500 yuan before retracting to 11,200 yuan at close, marking a further increase of 1,000 yuan compared to the weekend. 21-count Double Horse yarn also saw good sales, closing at 8,000 yuan, up 800 yuan. Other counts of both coarse and fine yarns also rose by 400 to 500 yuan, up to around 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was robust. Due to the lifting of the southern transportation ban on cotton yarn, yarn prices were reported to have risen across the board. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted as high as 395 yuan, eventually falling back to 370 yuan at close, a rebound of 40 yuan compared to the weekend. Four Gentlemen Yuan drill closed at 365 yuan, up 35 yuan. 190 high-end Shilin cloth prices rose to a high of 670-680 to 700 yuan, with the market also showing strength.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Great Demand for Subsidiary Currency, Nation Prepared <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[This Month's News] The deadline for the redemption of legal tender expired on the 20th of this month and has been decided by the Executive Yuan not to be extended. It has been noted that during the period when legal tender was in circulation, a portion of it was used for small change. Now that its use has been ordered to cease, the market's need for small change in gold yuan and subsidiary notes will be more pressing. The Issuing Department of the Central Bank, aware of this, has made full preparations. If businesses and industries have a need for small change and require subsidiary currency notes, they can directly exchange them at the department located at 24 Wai Street.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Situation in Northwestern Hunan <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Ke Yiren</p>
<p>[Our Changde Dispatch, 16th] Since the Provincial Training Corps moved to Changde last month, its 23rd class has begun on the 15th in Changde, divided into three major groups: one for military administration, including county self-defense captains, military section chiefs, and township heads; one for youth work, recruited and recommended by various counties; and one for national reconstruction, composed of outstanding youths from various counties, totaling over a thousand people. At the opening ceremony, Commander Li Mo'an emphasized that the purpose of this training is to implement total war and alleviate the people's suffering. Militarily, to prevent external bandits from entering and internal bandits from arising; politically, to ensure clean and capable governance, build a solid grassroots administration, and strengthen public organization and training; economically, to strive for "equality" and "abundance"; and in party affairs, to achieve sincere unity and consistency in action. Mr. Li also encouraged the integration of teaching and doing, focusing on practical work, emphasizing the research of work methods, going deep among the people, and gaining their support and trust. Mr. Li further emphatically called on the revolutionary youth of northwestern Hunan to unite and march towards the construction of northwestern Hunan, calling on 100,000 youths and 100,000 cadres to defend Greater Hunan. Youth work brigades and national reconstruction brigades have now been universally established in the counties under its jurisdiction, and they will be trained in Changde in stages and then distributed to various levels to carry out their work.</p>
<p>According to the resolutions of the Pacification Conference, the counties along the Xiang River have begun to strengthen the construction of fortifications. The area from Changde to the counties under its jurisdiction, especially the Eighth District, which is known as a special area without a single inch of highway, will open up new roads. The Engineering Department of the Provincial Highway Bureau has now sent specialists to survey the area, and the Telecommunications Bureau is also cooperating with this unprecedented transportation construction movement to carry out construction separately. The Seventeenth Pacification Headquarters has established a demonstration zone in Dangde and established a guidance committee, with Xie Ping, the director of the political work department, concurrently serving as chairman and the city defense commander being responsible for planning. The first phase of work has begun. The household registration of each township in the jurisdiction has been thoroughly cleaned up. The thirteen middle schools and more than thirty elementary schools in the demonstration zone are simultaneously implementing "mobilization for national reconstruction unified unit design teaching."</p>
<p>Northwestern Hunan is characterized by high mountains and remote areas, and the local situation is unique. Feuds occur from time to time. Local impartial individuals have witnessed that the government has not decisively handled feud cases and dares not make any moral response, allowing local tyrants to run rampant, which has been the case for more than a day. On October 18, Qin Wenquan, the deputy secretary of the Qiancheng County Party Department, was unfortunately assassinated. Upon receiving the report, the commander was furious, as it was just when Mr. Li had taken office and the Pacification Conference was in progress. He expressed his determination to severely punish Xiang Shifeng, the speaker of the Qiancheng County Council, who instigated the assassination of Qin Wenquan, according to national law, in order to eliminate harm for the people. After repeated investigations and trials, the evidence of the main perpetrator Xiang Shifeng and accomplices Luo Xinglian and Qiong Laosan, unemployed vagrants, was conclusive. They were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in Changde by the headquarters on the 15th. This was the first salvo of Mr. Li's governance of northwestern Hunan.</p>

<p>[Another Dispatch] This year, overseas Chinese in Indonesia can receive 103 guilders per parent for remittances to support their families. If they specify that the remittance is to be sent to the motherland, they can remit more than 110 gold yuan. If they specify that the remittance is to be sent in Hong Kong dollars, they can remit approximately 140 Hong Kong dollars. According to the current black market exchange rate, six Dutch guilders can be used to remit one gold yuan. However, the official exchange rate of the Dutch Indies government is still nine guilders and one and a half cents to remit one gold yuan. Such losses are excessive for overseas Chinese dependents. It is hoped that the government will quickly notify the Dutch Indies government to lower the exchange rate to benefit the lives of overseas Chinese dependents in the motherland.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Mystery of Gambling Opening in Guangxi <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Liang Yushan</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 18th] More than a month ago, there was a rumor here: "Guangxi will lift the ban on gambling." Considering the past achievements of Guangxi's ban on gambling, this statement was simply unbelievable. As events progressed, the rumor gradually turned into a thought-provoking mystery. Although the answer has not yet been revealed, clues are emerging, and the matter is no longer just a rumor.</p>
<p>To make the truth clearer, it is necessary to first trace back to the beginning of last month, when the provincial government held a provincial administrative conference. The discussion of provincial issues at the meeting was very detailed. In order to solve the current financial difficulties of the province, the Provincial Security Command summoned the county magistrates and other members attending the meeting to hold a secret meeting, and put forward an informal proposal to "lift the ban on gambling to enrich the finances."</p>
<p>Increasing Tax Revenue</p>
<p>During the discussion of the issue, there were two factions, and the debate was very intense at the time. The reasons held by those who supported the proposal were: "The current financial situation is difficult, especially in Guangxi, a province known for its poverty. The economy has always been poor, and coupled with the impact of the current environment, financial resources have become even more depleted, seemingly reaching a dead end. In order to alleviate the current predicament, it is necessary to find ways to increase revenue. There are many ways to generate wealth, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. Some people have suggested that the province open up gambling to enrich tax revenue." The opposition faction, "led by Huang Ronghua, the director of the Construction Department, strongly opposed it. He eloquently stated that Guangxi's ban on gambling has achieved considerable results in the past two years. If we change our past approach one day, wouldn't we be abandoning all our previous efforts, and even cause chaos?" However, as a result of the debate, the supporters were still in the majority, and they said that gambling has already become prevalent, and it is better to simply open it up than to have it exist in the private sector in a hypocritical manner. Perhaps it won't be as severe, and the government can also increase a batch of tax revenue from it." The issue was deadlocked at the time, and the proposal was formally reserved, but in fact, it was awaiting the authorities' decision.</p>
<p>Special Zones</p>
<p>Chairman Huang has always respected public opinion and did not express any views on this matter. At the same time, he telegraphed a certain important person for instructions. Although he has not yet received a reply, from another perspective, even if the matter is not approved, it will at least not be rejected. According to recent official disclosures: "Opening up is inevitable, and concrete plans have also been drawn up. The entire province will designate Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Longzhou, Nanning, Guixian, Guiping, Pingle, Yulin, Yishan, and Baise as ten 'special zones.' Clubs will be established in each zone, and they will be opened up in a planned manner. Formally, a commercial contracting system will be adopted, and the heads of each zone have already been dispatched. Chen Shouyun (manager of the Guilin City Bank) has been internally appointed as the general manager of the province."</p>
<p>The current economic predicament is undeniable. When everyone is at their wit's end, those with simple minds may inevitably yearn for a bright future. However, the issue of public security in the future is worth worrying about. "Where do evildoers come from? They come from opium and gambling." Please give the provincial authorities careful consideration. Sooner or later, the facts will provide an answer as to what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>Revenue Collection Bureau</p>
<p>In September of this year, in order to strictly prohibit the planting and transportation of opium, the provincial government established the Opium Suppression Supervision Office in Nanning, and also established branch offices in Yulin, Wuzhou, and other places, forming a strict opium suppression mechanism. Judging from the results of seizing drugs in the past few months, the province has made a strong determination to suppress opium. However, just a few months after the vigorous campaign, another rumor has emerged, and there are already considerable signs of it. It is said that "the province's opium suppression will change its established policy. The planting and trading of opium will still be strictly prohibited in the province, but the passage of opium to provinces outside the province will be temporarily relaxed." This requires discussing technical issues. It is rumored that the authorities are considering how to reorganize the opium suppression agency and how to take the overall situation into consideration. Therefore, the Opium Suppression Office seems to be about to be changed into a "Revenue Collection Bureau." The most concerning thing is the consequences of the matter. What will the consequences be in the future? Let's wait for the near future to verify!</p>

<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch, 19th] Lu Meiying, the 21-year-old leader of the Bandit Jinsha Women's Resistance Association, committed numerous evils and murdered many people. The Nantong Garrison Command, with approval, executed her by firing squad on the afternoon of the 18th. This female bandit was captured during our suppression campaign in early summer. After interrogation, she confessed without reservation and was sentenced to death. However, because the female criminal was six months pregnant at the time, the execution was not carried out immediately. She gave birth last month and delivered a son, who has now been sent to the local nursery for care.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Ugly Ku Klux Klan <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Diao Ying</p>
<p>"Roosevelt was a communist!"</p>
<p>"Roosevelt's goal was to establish a communist-ruled world empire!"</p>
<p>"The Truman administration is a Jewish communist government!"</p>
<p>Anyone with a little common sense who hears these absurd and ridiculous slanders will probably just laugh them off? However, there are people in America who are shouting and making a fuss like this, with leaflets and pamphlets flying everywhere, seemingly creating a raging movement. And what's even more unbelievable is that there are quite a few people who consider these words to be creeds and are clamoring to join this movement. Those madmen have strengthened one of the ugliest groups in American history—the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>The Ku Klux Klan has always made it its primary task to abuse people of color. Innocent black people are often brutally murdered by them using unspeakable means. This is the famous lynching. What is strange is that even the judiciary is tolerant, feigning deafness and ignoring it. As a result, the power of the Ku Klux Klan is growing in the southern states of the United States. The American Civil War was fought to liberate slaves, but even after the war ended, these Klansmen still often held secret meetings. Around 1930, the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan were notorious for extorting money everywhere and had to temporarily disappear. However, recently, after President Truman formally proposed a bill of human rights, reiterating the protection of black people's equal status, the Ku Klux Klan in the southern states took the opportunity to stir up trouble, publicly expanding its organization and absorbing many new Klansmen!</p>
<p>Klansmen always cover themselves with white cloths and wear a pointed cloth hood on their heads. They cover their faces, leaving two holes for their eyes, like European executioners from the 17th and 18th centuries. On the one hand, they look hideous and terrifying, which is in line with their terrorist methods, but on the other hand, it is not because they are afraid of being recognized when they commit crimes. However, the white cloth covering the body is not very long, so the trousers worn by the Klansmen are exposed. Recently, an American journalist went to interview the Ku Klux Klan meeting and saw several Klansmen wearing police uniforms! With the police attitude like this, the lawlessness of the Ku Klux Klan can be imagined.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Ku Klux Klan in each state are called "Grand Dragon." The "Grand Dragon" of Atlanta is a middle-aged doctor named Green. On the day in August of this year when new Klansmen were sworn in, that "Grand Dragon" stepped onto the altar in a green satin robe and publicly declared: "The separation of races was originally the will of God! This party is determined to maintain the superior position of white people, and this party is determined to return the southern states to the rule of white people... If those northerners dare to act rashly, then don't blame us for being impolite, we are not afraid of bloodshed!"</p>
<p>According to that "Grand Dragon," out of the 159 cities in the state of Georgia, 130 cities have organized the Ku Klux Klan. In addition, states such as Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida all have very large organizations. Their mission is to be anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-Catholic. If you have ever met a Chinese living in the southern United States, he will definitely tell you that the Ku Klux Klan is really not very polite to the Chinese.</p>
<p>The Ku Klux Klan is not afraid of bloodshed, which may be true. In Georgia, a black couple was walking at dusk when three or five "not afraid of bloodshed" Klansmen rushed up and whipped the two black people all over with blood, and as a result, they were not punished at all. There is a dormitory in Alabama that is exclusively for black women. One night in mid-June of this year, a large number of masked Klansmen broke in and committed heinous acts—but the authorities did not investigate! The reason is that the local police chief said that there are too many Klansmen among his police officers.</p>
<p>Enlightened people in the United States feel that they are making too much trouble and are doing their best to curb the activities of these masked thugs. Newspapers and religious groups have constantly criticized them, but the activities of the Ku Klux Klan have never been truly sanctioned. In 1925, 50,000 white-robed monsters marched proudly down the streets of Washington, and their behind-the-scenes people took the opportunity to coerce and make tens of millions of dollars. Although the situation is different now, the politicians who are promoting the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan are also quite powerful. Their purpose is to threaten black people, prevent them from voting, and attack Truman. But Truman finally won! Does he really have the courage to resolutely challenge the local forces of evil? That will depend on the development in the next four years.</p>

<h3 id="e123">School Janitor Ah Jin <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>Arriving at school against the north wind, it felt a bit chilly. I wanted to drink some boiled water to warm up, but when I picked up the thermos, it felt surprisingly light. Looking around the office, the books and records were scattered, and the desks and chairs were covered in a thin layer of dust, not at all like usual.</p>
<p>"Hey, where's Ah Jin?"</p>
<p>The headmaster replied:</p>
<p>"He's sick and took the day off."</p>
<p>Just then, Old Chen, who had seen off a guest and returned from the station, chimed in:</p>
<p>"Who said that? I saw him with my own eyes, carrying six dou of rice, getting on the bus."</p>
<p>This made the headmaster laugh. The headmaster was usually very amiable; how could he get angry about this? Besides, with only ten dollars a month, it was indeed a bit demanding to not find some extra work.</p>
<p>Ah Jin was a new school janitor hired this semester. He was over fifty years old and had worked for the government before. Once he took over, the school's miscellaneous tasks were all on track. Compared to the teenage girl from last semester, who even needed reminders to ring the bell, there was simply no comparison.</p>
<p>At first, we thought Ah Jin's enthusiasm for work was motivated by the ten silver dollars he received. Because according to the initial value, it could buy five dou of white rice, which was indeed a rare opportunity in the eyes of the villagers. But as time went on, prices rose sharply, and he still worked the same. This showed that his diligence was entirely natural and not at all fake.</p>
<p>For several days, he suffered from a severe case of malaria but still forced himself to come to school. Sometimes, we saw him sitting weakly in the sun, shivering, and asked:</p>
<p>"Ah Jin, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer, hurriedly shaking his head. Villagers have many taboos, and seeing him trying to stop people from speaking was truly amusing. Today, he had surprisingly caught up with the trend and started working as a "dan bang" (small-scale independent trader). Perhaps he heard that a stone of rice could be exchanged for a dan of sugar or four bolts of cloth? This, besides making us sympathize with his situation, also made us sigh deeply, "The scholar is useless for practical matters."</p>
<p>But Ah Jin's independent trading didn't seem to go as smoothly as others. Because he didn't return that day, everyone already saw the premonition. Hearing others say that because there were many people running, the profits were not as high as before. Over thirty dollars of white rice, when brought to Shanghai, no one wanted to pay even thirty dollars. The sugar and cigarettes he brought back were even more difficult to sell. But what troubled Ah Jin the most was trying to squeeze onto the train. After lining up, he was pushed off several times, and almost got knocked to the ground by the crowd. Finally getting on the train, he unfortunately got on the wrong route, going all the way to Hangzhou on an express train, resulting in fines and lodging costs, causing a lot of trouble. Returning empty-handed today, he seemed much older, with a worried face, calculating how to repay the capital of six dou of rice. Then Old Chen jokingly said:</p>
<p>"Ah Jin, how was the scenery in Hangzhou?"</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly, not saying a word. Then he suddenly looked at the clock and went to ring the class bell.</p>

<p>One day, the humorous master Mark Twain told a strange story:</p>
<p>I married a widow, who had a grown daughter. My father fell in love with my stepdaughter, and ended up marrying her – therefore, my father became my stepson-in-law, while my stepdaughter became my mother, because she is my father's wife.</p>
<p>My wife gave birth to a son, who is naturally my father's brother-in-law, and also my uncle, because he is my stepmother's brother.</p>
<p>My father's wife became my brother's mother, and my brother is also my grandson, because he is my daughter's son.</p>
<p>Therefore, my wife is my grandmother, because she is my mother's mother – I am my wife's husband, and also my wife's grandson – at the same time, I am my own grandfather!</p>

<p>Passing He Xiansheng's Yangzhou Former Residence, Lamenting for a Long Time</p>
<p>In dangerous times, his arm protected the mountains and rivers (he once reviewed troops and fell off his horse, breaking his left arm). After his death, he surprisingly had no acres of land. His former officials and students were all over the world. Green moss and yellow leaves fill the hall. The inscription was made on the eighth day of the seventh month (last year on this day, I drafted the epitaph for the master). Tears fall in the autumn wind in the second year. The slanting sun outside the curtain, the swallows chatter in confusion. Returning, I still say the master is sleeping.</p>
<p>My friend Lu Mengjiao built a thatched building on the foothills of Ziyang Mountain, drawing clouds from the sparse peaks, and is engaged in decorating it. Thinking of you turning from Eight Fujian to Suzhou, and soon again going through Guangzhou's campaign, the road has not been rested, why are you so busy? The building site was the palace forbidden area of the Southern Song Dynasty, which has been destroyed and erased for a long time.</p>
<p>The rustling leaves become autumn by themselves. A thatched roof, the lamps are clear, ancient sorrows. Leave it to future generations to point out again: Zhao's Grand Palace, Lu's building.</p>
<p>Post road, mountain journey, then the edge of the water, Qinhuai willows, Wuyi tea, temporarily living here and then hurriedly departing, tomorrow's journey clothes are wet with waves.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Abandoned Corpse <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jun</p>
<p>To die without a burial place is the most tragic thing. But in the city of Shanghai, abandoned corpses on the streets have become a "common sight" for most people. Throughout the year, there are deaths from freezing, starvation, disease, poverty, the old, the young, all kinds. Among them, the young are the most numerous, which is enough to prove that in this society, the "weak" are the least fit to survive.</p>
<p>In addition to human corpses, there are also corpses of rats, cats, chicks, etc., which are almost everywhere. As for corpses of cattle, sheep, and pigs, they are people's best delicacies, and naturally they will not be abandoned on the ground.</p>
<p>Animal corpses are not enough to move people's sympathy, which is not surprising; if human corpses are also not enough to move people's sympathy, then if Mencius's saying: "Everyone has a heart of compassion" can be established, we can add a sentence: "Those without a heart of compassion are not human." The following is an example of a "non-human" matter:</p>
<p>Today, looking out from the window of my studio, there is a torn and ripped small corpse at the foot of the opposite wall. My students pointed it out to me, I couldn't see it clearly, I only saw a string of red and purple flesh and blood, with what seemed to be two small legs attached below, and what seemed to be a tuft of black fuzz above (probably hair). The students said it was the corpse of a child. Four or five naughty children were surrounding it, throwing stones at the corpse for fun. This scene was too tragic for me to bear watching, but I also wanted to keep watching, I hoped to be able to clearly distinguish that it was not a human corpse, but an animal corpse. However, they told me that it was indeed a human corpse.</p>
<p>I originally didn't want to write this down, because it was too tragic! But, later I felt that I should still write it out, so that more people know, so that this unfortunate person does not become too lonely. Please, Mr. Editor, donate the fee for this article to any children's education and care institution.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Thunder Learning <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>For hundreds of years, the former capital, the beauty of all the architecture of the palace gardens, altars, temples, and monasteries, can be called the best in the country, even compared with the famous cities in the world, it can also occupy a superior position, it is a pity that these few years have been destroyed beyond recognition. Not destroyed during the War of Resistance, but destroyed after victory, not destroyed by artillery fire, but destroyed by people who have fled to reside there, not destroyed by bandits, but destroyed by "capable people" and so-called intellectual youths, which is especially heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Great Altar was briefly seen in last week's telegraphic dispatch of this newspaper, which is the situation in recent months. Before this, in the past two or three years, it had already been occupied by stationed troops, and other displaced youths had lived together, tearing down and burning, which did not happen in a day. The "Temple of Heaven" was the place where emperors of previous dynasties worshipped heaven. The emperor was known as the "Supreme," but the honor of God was above the emperor, next to the emperor was the "Son of Heaven," that is, the son of God. The emperor "faced south," that is, sat facing north and facing south, receiving the congratulations of the ministers, so-called "Under the whole world, there is no land that is not the king's land, and no subject who is not the king's subject," but the emperor was also God's subject, and could only sit beside God in the Temple of Heaven, waiting on God, called "accompanying the sacrifice." Therefore, the vastness of the base of the Temple of Heaven, the magnificence of the architecture, were extraordinarily magnificent, the altar was circular (the ancients thought that heaven was round and the earth was square), and the steps and railings around it were all carved with jade stone in the shape of clouds, dragons, and the eight treasures. Every year the emperor held a grand fire ceremony to worship heaven in the southern suburbs, arriving here outside the main gate, he had to get out of the carriage and walk, first entering the side room to fast and bathe (called the fasting palace), and then dress solemnly, bowing three times and kowtowing nine times. The dignified ninth-five sovereign, had to humble himself here, it can be known that it was incomparably solemn in those days. And now it is dim everywhere, everything is destroyed, a scene of filth and desolation, one cannot help but sigh for God!</p>
<p>Another major building that was destroyed was the Yonghe Temple, where even the bronze Buddha, which was more than ten feet high including the bronze base, was carried away or destroyed and sold. One can imagine the rest. This palace is located inside Andingmen, the northernmost part of the old capital, next to the Guozijian (Imperial Academy) and the Confucius Temple. In the early Qing Dynasty, during the Kangxi period, it was originally the mansion of the fourth prince, Prince Yong, Yinzhen. When Kangxi died, Prince Yong succeeded to the throne, that is, Emperor Yongzheng, moved to the imperial palace, and his former residence, the prince's mansion, was the "Potential Residence" (taking the meaning of "dragon's potential," whoever rises from the potential residence to the inner palace to become emperor, is the flying dragon ascending to heaven). It was not allowed for any nobles to live there. Yongzheng revered Buddha, and especially liked to approach Lama Yili, so he changed it into a place to enshrine foreign Buddhas, with several lamas in charge of incense. It was not called a temple, but a "palace." Large and small Buddha statues, ox-headed gods and snake-bodied gods, men, women, animals, naked embracing, the so-called "joyful Buddha," since the Republic of China, the lamas' lives have gradually become stretched, and the "palace" has been opened, with a yellow curtain covering the lower bodies of the Buddha statues. Viewers would pay money, and the curtain could be lifted, which was a kind of income, which was also pitiful. Now even this is gone, and there is no basis for life at all. If Yongzheng knew in the ground, what would he think?</p>
