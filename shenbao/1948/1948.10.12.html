<h3>總統於國慶日發表感言　闡明當前建國途徑　勗勉全全民完成戡亂責任</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕中華民國卅七年國慶紀念，總統府十日晨隆重舉行慶祝典禮，蔣總統親臨主持，李副總統曁中樞文武官員孫科·于右任·王寵惠·張伯苓·邵力子·陳布雷·何應欽等四百餘人均參加·總統府禮堂內外掛燈結彩，燦然一新，總統佩大綬彩玉勳章，於十時正蒞臨，並卽席致詞，首述國父曁諸先烈締造民國之艱難及今日建國責任之艱鉅，總統對建國前途表示樂觀，並强調建國途徑，必須遵循國父遺敎，實行三民主義，總統指陳共匪爲民族主義之敵人，其目的在消滅中國民族，當此國家民族成敗存亡關鍵之際，政府同人應特加警惕，一致奮勉，認淸剿匪戡亂卽爲實行民族主義，不畏險阻，不顧困難，在軍事上·政治上·一致努力，完成戡亂建國之責任。總統致詞全文如次；</p>
<h3>目前迫切任務完成民族主義</h3>
<p>今天是我們中華民國三十七年的國慶紀念日，回想三十七年前，我們國父領導革命先烈和全國同胞，共同一致艱苦奮鬥，推翻了滿淸二百六十餘年的統治，廢除了幾千年來的專制政體，創立了中華民國，這我們中華民族歷史上最輝煌最偉的史蹟，今天我們臨到這個光榮的紀念日，追念我們國父和先烈犧牲奮鬥的精神，回到我們本身應盡的責任，格外覺得負荷的重大，惟有同心一德，繼續努力，來完成國父未竟的志事，乃能安慰國父和先烈在天之靈。</p>
<p>中華民國是國父所手創的，國父的三民主義，爲我們的建國的原則，五十餘年來，一般革命先烈的犧牲奮鬥，完全是為了實現三民主義。今年三月我們召開國民大會，根據憲法，成立憲政政府，民權主義的實行，於此始獲得初步的成功，中華民國從此始成爲名實相符的民國。國父曾經說過，十三年以前的中華民國，因爲軍閥官僚盜竊政權，徒有民國之名，而無民國之實，從十三年到現在，已經二十四年了這二十四年中間，我們國家雖然遭遇了任何國家建國期中所未有的艱難困苦，然而我們政府和人民，始終一致，為實現三民主義而奮鬥　，終於建立了了一個名實相符的中華民國。這種堅苦卓絕的而就，值得我們大家的慶幸，更可以加強我們對於建國前途的信心。民權主義既然可以獲得成功，則民生主義的實現，自然也沒有困難，只要我們政府與人民能夠遵照國父遺教，共同一致，努力推行，自然可以進入民生康樂的境地。</p>
<p>本人今天要提醒我們政府同仁和全國同胞的，就是我們目前迫切的任務，莫過於完成民族主義，大家都知道，民族主義的完成，是實現民權主義和民生主義的前提，惟有民族獨立，生存有了保障，民權和民生纔有著落，如果民族主義不能實現，則民權就不能發展，民生就無從策進，整個國家民族都要淪為異族的奴隸牛馬。辛亥年我們推倒滿清，大家以為這是民族主義的成功，後來有日本帝國主義者的侵略，抗戰勝利之後，大家以為國父的民族主義已經可以完全實現，但到了今天，證明這不是過部份的成功。今天我們民族的敵人，仍然存在，而且是很險毒，很頑強，這個敵人的剷除，較之推翻滿清和擊敗日本的工作尤為艱鉅，因為滿清和日本都是外來的敵人，目標顯明，易於認識，全國同胞受盡他蹂躪壓迫的痛苦，自然是同仇敵愾，起而反抗，絕不會受他的欺騙和愚弄，而今天我們民族的敵人，則是陰毒險狠的共匪，共匪是戴了中國人的假面具，作國際組織的第五縱隊，來殘殺本國的同胞。他表面上高唱民主自由的口號，實際上他所作所爲，無不是破壞中國的民主自由，因爲他同是中國人，所以他爲虎作倀的罪惡難於辦認，因爲他工於欺騙的宣傳，故其陰謀詭計，不僅一般普通的國民不易辦識，就是知識份子亦往往受其愚弄，隨聲附和，而政府戡亂的工作，反而遭遇重大的障礙，所以我認爲自從國父領導國民革命以來，到今天纔遭遇了最後的敵人，民族主義纔遭遇了最後的試騐。我們全國同胞，在這國家民族生死成敗的最後關頭，要免於做奴隸牛馬的悲慘命運，惟有提高警覺，認淸共匪的眞面目，發揮我們愛國家，愛民族的良知，同仇敵愾，犧牲奮鬥，來消滅這個最後的敵人，保障我國國家的統一和獨立，然後纔能眞正實現國父的三民主義。</p>
<h3>今後的剿匪局勢　戡亂軍事非數月一兩年可完成　大家應加輕紡團結努力消滅敵人</h3>
<p>我在今年上半年憲政政府成立之時，曾經預計在十一月以前，要肅淸黃河以南的股匪，可是現在已經是十月，不但黄河以南的股匪沒有肅淸，而且最近濟南又被匪軍攻陷，這是國家最大的不幸，也是個人感覺最愧疚的事情。我當時何以作此預計呢，就是我想像行憲以後，全國同胞都要祖負政治的責任，必可統一意志，集中力量，以增强戡亂剿匪的工作，但後來事實與理想完全相反，此其原因乃是由於一般沒有受過匪禍的人，爲共匪虛偽宣傳所迷惑，以爲共匪也是中國人，他們也在實行民主自由，因此覺得共匪的叛變，不過是普通的內一亂，決不致像日本帝國主義者那一樣兇殘可怖，由於大家心理上有一了這種錯覺，於是意志不能集中，精神趨於散漫，力量便無從發揮，以致半年以來我們剿匪軍事不能收到軍民一致協同配合的效果，受到不少的挫折，這是我們失敗的主要原因。我們今天如果再不反省，再不糾正過去這種因循僥倖的心理，不認識共匪是我們整個民族的敵人，不覺悟到亡國滅種的危險，從而同心一德，同仇敵愾，作生死存亡的決鬥，則以後的剿匪局勢，將要比現在更困難，更嚴重。國父常說「精神童於物質」，今天戡亂建國的成敗利鈍，只在大家一轉念之間一，我們如果能反省失敗的原因，一記取過去的敎訓，從此團結　神，集中力量，努力奮鬥，那我們革命環境愈危險，工作愈艱苦，成功也就愈迅速。證以過去卅餘年來的革命歷史不爽，無論在怎樣困苦艱難的時候，只要我們能照着主義和革命的責任，不顧一切犧牲，冒險犯難，百折不回，最後沒有不得到成功的。反之，共匪之所以必歸失敗，就是因爲他只是口喊革命，而事實上絲毫沒有革命精神，只是投機取巧，損人利己，最後終必害人害己，自趨消滅，我們因爲有這種冒險犯難刻苦奮鬥的精神，所以遭遇的困難愈多，成功的機會也就愈大。這半年以來，我們誠然顯露了許多的弱點和缺點，發現了許多的錯誤，遭遇了許多意想不到的困難，但這無寗說是一種有利的現象，弱點的顯露，正是我們反省的資料，錯誤的發現，正是我們改進的開始，暫時的頓挫，正是我們轉敗爲勝的基礎。只要我們能不斷改革，不斷進步，最後一定可以達到成功的目的。今後戡平共匪的軍事，當然不是幾個月或一兩年短期間所能完成，但是古　人說：「生於憂患，死於安樂」，愈是憂患重疊的時候，就愈是振奮志氣，培養新生力量一的時候，只要我們政府全體同人，以及全國同胞能多反省覺悟，革除因循懈怠，散漫浮冗的積習，團結精神，通力合作，自立自强，則匪的弱點，必然逐漸暴露，而終歸失敗，共匪過去曾經誇大宣傳，說是今年一年，就可以把我們政府推翻，但到了現在，又打算延長叛變到五年了。大家要知道，時間就是我們勝利的因素，時間愈久，共匪的弱點暴露愈多，民衆對他的眞相認識愈深，而他失敗的時機也就愈近。現在匪區的民衆，對於奸匪的統治，無不深惡痛絕，無論那一地點，只要他在軍事上不能控制，民衆就立刻起而反抗，這就證明了共匪是我們整個國家民族不分地區職業的公敵，在我們强固深厚的民族意識之下，必然歸於消滅，我們政府同人和全國同胞，必須認淸時局艱難和自身責任的重大，今後無論政府的那一部門，社會的任何階層，都要集中全力，來加强我們剿匪軍事，對工作要精勤惕厲，對生活要刻苦節約，對政洽經濟要和諧協作，彼此配合，緊密團結，在同一目標之下，加緊努力，來消滅我們民族的敵人，貫澈國父的民族主義，民族主義完全實現，然後民權主義和民生主義的推行，乃有保障，乃能成功。這是本人今天對於國慶紀念的感想，用來勉勵自己，和各位同仁與全國同胞，希望大家同心協力，共同奮鬥，來完成我們戡亂建國的使命。（完）</p>
<h3>魯社會處長抵京報告　王耀武突圍戰死　屍體被民眾掩埋被俘說絕對不確</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕「王耀武將軍確在濟南戰役中突圍時戰死，所傳被俘消息絕對不確」。此係山東省社會處處長王平一十日在山東旅京同鄕會大會中所報吿者。王氏係於濟南陷落後第四天之九月廿九日始化裝逃出濟南，歷盡艱險，於十日晨抵達南京。據王氏稱：「王耀武將軍係廿一日下午三時在濟南城頭巡視陣地時，誤墜於偽裝之機關槍掩體內，而將右膝蓋骨跌傷，傷勢甚重，行動須人扶持，廿三日下午，本入與王主席在省府內共進晚餐時，王氏態度尙非常鎭靜，所屬官兵，亦戰意旺盛；廿四日下午，巷戰十分激烈，王主席乃至城內北極閣高地指揮作戰，本人始與其失掉聯絡。至二十九日，本人逃至濟南城東之黄台車站花園莊時，曾遇社會處粥廠之職員某君面吿本人，王主席於二十七日上午八時，率領少數部隊，突圍至黄台橋以西，與匪遭遇，當塲戰死，隨行衛士，亦經犧牲，王主席遺體，已被當地民衆掩埋」。王氏繼稱：「二十六日共匪在濟南城中卽盛傳捉到四個王耀武，而濟南附近之土共，亦有三處報吿捉到王耀武，蓋當時身體矮胖面目黝黑之中年人均有被目爲王耀武之可能。在壽光縣境，被土匪所扣留之「王耀武」實爲一卸任之老縣長，因不堪共匪拷打而自承爲王耀武，匪方曾大肆宣傳，及解至濟南，始知非是，截至太人離濟時，共匪仍在搜索王主席之下落」。</p>

<p>一般人以爲，當前國家的局勢已達從來未有的危險，本人亦承認目前政治，經濟和軍事的情形相當嚴重，但決不如一般所想像者之甚。大家必須知道，目前是一個非（常的革命時期，我們對於一切問題，都必須從革命的立塲，和革命歷史來觀察，只要大家不忘却自己革命立塲和責任，都能保持傳統的革命精神和信心，那我們對目前的時局，就決不至於悲觀。總理說：「革命力量，精神能力，居十分之九，物資能力，僅居十分之一，」可見革命的成敗，完全決於我們精神的心理，只要我們心理堅強，精神振奮，則任何危險，皆可克服，任何困難，皆可打破，我國自「九一八」以來，國家多難，經十七年之久，民眾心理，當然不能正常，一般神經陷於脆弱，本黨同志，有領導社會的責任，必須奮發大無畏精神，以安定人心，安定時局。</p>
<p>新聞界勿報道刺激人心新聞</p>
<p>對於時局所想像的危險，實際超過事實遠甚，而輾轉傳述，又往往過甚其詞，絕非眞相。本人此次出巡，經過平，津，瀋陽，上海各地，在平津時，報紙天天登戲京，滬各地如何發生搶購風潮，人民心理如何恐慌，社會秩序幾乎不能維持。後來回到上海，纔知上海方面雖曾發生搶購的現象，但兩天之後，早已恢復常態，而北方報紙却加以過分的渲染，同樣的，上海報紙又說平津一帶搶購風潮如何嚴重，事實上北平方面除了天橋曾經發生一次擠購糧食的事件之外，其他市塲都很平靜。舉此一端，就可以知道現社會上有許多事情，實際上並不嚴重，祗是渲染過甚，轉相驚擾，這一點我盼望新聞界人士特別注意，切不可報道剌激人心的新聞，作爲增加發行的手段，應該在國家民族的前提之下負起領導輿論的責任，共謀社會的安定和進步。</p>
<p>軍事當局主動切不可牽制</p>
<p>軍事方面，最近三個月以來，國軍幾乎處處立於不利的地位，其所以致此的原因，乃是由於軍事當局顧慮太多的緣故。軍事最要的在主動，古人說「運用之妙，存乎一心』，軍事當局必須不受任何方面的牽制和干涉，乃能從心所欲，指揮如意，爲補救這個缺點，大家必須信賴統帥，付以指揮的全權，然後攻守遲速，乃能統籌全局，適應戰略，也纔能集中力量，爭取主動，切不可使軍事受政治的牽制，以致陷於被動或失敗。</p>
<p>至於國際方面，當前局勢確甚緊張，但我們對於聯合國，仍具堅强的信心，我們要自主自强，以不變應萬變。因此，更覺得有完成國家統一的必要。</p>
<p>行政立監三院必須打成一片</p>
<p>總之，我認為目前的時局的確危險，但絕不悲觀，只要各部門負責同志瞭然於成敗相同，生死一致的關係，大家團結意志，共同努力，則時局之轉危爲安，軍事之轉敗爲勝，可以立待。尤其是行政，立法，監察三院，以後必須打成一片，在整個國策之下，密切配合，協調一致，俾憲政政府發揮其對其國家的功能，戡亂建國，得以增强力量。立·監兩院的決議和意見，行政院必須切實採納，而立。監兩院對於一切議案的提出和決定，亦必須考慮國家事實上的可能，和行政院實際的困難，如此互助合作，乃能相輔相成，希望共體時艱，集中力量，齊一步驟，來完成我們戡亂建國共同的使命。</p>

<p>代論</p>
<h3>論衛生展覽的重要</h3>
<p>— 潘公義</p>
<p>我們不要單望生活舒適，先要問問自己可有一束衛生的習慣？我們不要儘喊　國成功，先要問問自己向有一個健康的身體？因爲享福舒適須靠健康的身體，建國興國更須靠健康的身體。身體不健康，一切都是落空。</p>
<p>强國先　身，國民具有頭等的身體，才能造成頭等的國家。現在我們要躋於五强之一，要求國際平等，自己的身體先要與人平等，先要强。生活舒適與建國成功是賴高度的文化：一個文化的黄金時代，三十年前，必須有一個身體的黄金時代。</p>
<p>中國全國的文化生活，本是變化很多，何以秦漢以後，變化便少？五代以後，更越來越淸一色，創造力何以越來越逼窄？一千年前秦，豫·魯·晋和今日的秦··豫·魯·晋枳較，在文化的創造址·何以會有天壞之別？北宋到明初的江西·和現在的江西相較，又是怎樣？太平天國時代的蘇州和目前的蘇州，何以也判若兩地？除普通一些經濟與政治的解釋外，難道絲毫不引起人才品質的問題？</p>
<p>我們開國祖先征自然，，闢錦繡河山，何一非恃堅强的身體？神農黄帝都親嘗百草，他們本身卽是醫學衛生家。國父孫中山先生自己是醫師而絕對提倡國民保育。我國古時帝王聖賢都高大而長壽，湯高九尺，文王十尺，孔子九尺六寸，其儀表各魁梧威嚴。詩經上的美男子是公叔段，美女子是莊姜，都是碩大健美，黄帝自己活到二四〇歲，他設：「人生上壽一二〇，中壽一〇〇，下壽八〇，不然皆夭折耳。」</p>
<p>嵇叔夜於論養生，亦曰「導養得理，以盡性命，上獲千餘歲，下可數百年，可有之耳。」瞪之今日科學，生物之壽命以成長所需年歲乘七，我們腿臂兩根長骨相遇時卽爲成長年齡，這時剛剛卅歲，若以七倍計，則可得二百十歲。然而我們平均壽命祗三十歲，較諸文明國家相差一倍以上，此何故？正如叔夜所謂：</p>
<p>「世人不察，惟五穀是見，聲色是耽，目感元黄，耳務淫噎，滋味煎其府藏，醴醪鬻其胃腸，香芳腐其骨髓，喜怒悖其正氣，思慮銷其精神，哀樂殃其平粹，夫以　爾之驅，改之者非，塗，易竭之身，而內外受敵，身非木石，其能入乎？其自用甚者，飲食不節，以生百病，好色不倦，以致乏絕，風寒所災，百毒所傷，中這天於衆難。」</p>
<p>我國尙書洪範篇的「五福」：日壽，二曰康寗，三日富，四曰好攸德，五日考終命，那一件事不在提倡衛生與健康？財富與道德是健康的產物，考終命是無疾而終，當然是衛生的效果。尙書是我們古時政治哲學的最高理論，不論這部書是眞是偽，但此種大道理總是古時已著。就講一部禮記吧，差不多半部是說衛生之道，而旦特別重視心　衛生。胎養，大戴禮記保傳篇便說得很詳。兒童營養，在易經上十分注意。孔子講易經周易序卦：「物生必蒙，故受之以蒙，蒙者蒙也：物之穉也，物穉不可不養也，故受之以需，需者飲食之道也」。近世所倡的安全教育，孟子老早就教導我們了：「君子不立乎嚴牆之下」。孔子敎我們乘車之道：「升車，必正立，執綏。車中不內顧，不疾言，不親指」。我國自來習俗上許多迷信和季節，皆有衛生教育的深意。例如：立夏稱人，便寓有健康檢査之意；那月廿四日「謝灶」，含有淸潔的意味：原是防疫，並　公共衛生。此種例子，不勝枚舉，都足以證明衛生是立國之本</p>
<p>十九世紀第二個二十年，英法製造家將二種異樣的玻璃混合一起，遂有近代複雜的顯微鏡出世，因此巴士脫發現了發酵的現象，繼又知道蠶病的原因，到底證明了疾病是以細菌　傳染，衛生學上起了大革命。一八七六年，德醫郭霍發表炭疽熟桿狀細菌生命史六年後發現癆病的傳染</p>
<p>七九六年，英醫動納發明種生痘，「八七三年美醫杜倫登以衛生生活打敗了癆病，從此衛生學和衛生機關應運重要，公共衛生遂得長足的進步，疾病率和死亡率銳减，戰前，各國公共衛生還停留於控制疾病上用功夫，今日則大改作風，用大力量來辦預防工作，同時注意醫療了，預防工作中，衛生敎育是頂頂有效的事業。我們這次上海的衛生展覽，卽是民衆衛生敎育的重要部門，希望這個展覽，適合國情，能夠扼要的有系統的積極的培養市民衛生習慣，灌輸衛生賞識，造成衛　觀念，使大家認識不衛生是恥辱，是野蠻；這是有　生活，有關國運，而且有關全人類的幸福。同時盼望上海市民接受這個衛生的洗禮並傳佈到全國</p>
<h3>王財長返抵首都　今謁總統翁院長報告赴美經過　對引導　游資將制定方案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕財長王雲五十一日晚八時四十分返抵京。將於十二日晋謁總統及翁院長。王氏在車站語記者，此次赴美參加兩項國際金融會議，經過情形均甚良好，會中最大之成就，卽在原則上有兩項重要確定，（一）過去國際復興開發銀行多注重復興工作，今後將同時注意開發（二）過去多注重歐洲，今後對遠東及南美均將同等重視。上述兩項原則與會各國均一致同意，其執行之技術將交由執行委會負責。關於執行委會之組織，委員共十四人，其中有當然委員五人，由中·美·英·法·印度之代表充任，另有委員九人，已由會員國已分別選定。關於中國參加國際貨幣基金會議股金之繳納問題，王氏稱現尙未繳納，因中國改革幣制後之對外匯率迄尙未確定，中國應繳納之股金數，依照規定數額應爲參加國際貨幣基金會議時所保有外匯之十分之一，當時中國共有外匯五億餘美元，故我國應繳股金五千餘萬元，中國對外之匯率，將於適當時期內提出，至先繳股金抑先提出匯率，則由我國自由決定。王氏並稱，此次出席會議與美·英等國財長晤談時，渠等對於我國幣制之改革均認爲係適時之舉，對我國幣制改革後之情况亦均認爲甚爲良好，且認爲幣制改革爲我國實施自助計劃之開端。記者會詢其此次歸來帶來何等新希望，貸款問題是否曾向國際復興開發銀行提出，王氏稱此次並非爲貸款而往，目貸款亦須俟執行委員會成立及繳納股金後，始可提出。王氏抵京時，財次徐柏園李儻及各級負責人均赴車站歡迎。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長王雲五十日夜十時一刻目美抵滬，據談：外援問題，本人認爲與自助可並行不悖，現階段軍事援華特別重要，故本人於華府時，曾公開宣稱中國每年需要五億美元之軍事援助，此項觀點，美方贊同者亦不乏其人。記者與王氏論及通貨之發行問題，王財長謂此次匆匆趕回，處理游資爲一重要原因，目前發行雖近十億，但其中三分之二之道，實為當務之急，今後將制定方案，統籌辦理，關於立院主</p>

<h3>國慶日不幸事件　美兵三人棒打小學生</h3>
<p>十餘小學生負傷</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕首都國慶日發生美兵棒打小學生之不幸事件，受傷者十餘人，經各方調停此事可望順利解決。緣十日晨天主敎會所辦新生小學（在林森路）童軍集隊，準備參加公務員運動會時，被美兵數人奪去彼等所持木棍亂打，致學生王寳訓·劉家錚·孫子文·胡渭等十餘人負傷，立法委員徐公遂之子涂鯨亦在內。旋美憲兵乖車趕到，將三美兵帶走，肇事美兵與耶穌會聖心堂有關，該堂郝神父經東區警察局局長之勸解已向新生校長徐哲人道歉，並允賠償受傷學生之醫藥費，據徐校長稱，郝神父確曾到校，表示「如是我們的錯，我向你道歉」，但所云賠償醫藥費事，尙未見諸事實。</p>

<h3>宋子文談話</h3>
<p>謂已再電中央派調査</p>

<h3>處理美剩餘物資物供局答覆抨擊　西報之評論與事實不符</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕近日西文報章，　載我政府處理美國剩餘物資之評論，物資供應局爰就事實予以答覆如下：</p>
<p>「滬地西文報紙，近來迭有抨擊我國處理美剩餘物資之文字，關於此種因報導錯誤而ｕ　生之言論，殊與事實不符。</p>
<p>茲先就我政府處理剩餘物資機構之工作成績而言，行政院物資供應局已將太平洋各島接收器材約一百萬噸陸續運回國内，或已就島出售，所有島上工作，數月内可望結束，其已運滬物資，迄今處理已達四十五萬噸，約當全部接收物資之半舞，其他如登陸艇，小型船，通訊器材，及食品等之處理，亦均達到預期速率，其餘少數未及處理之物資，亦正積極整理運售中。</p>
<p>觀於上項處理實際情形使吾人對於上項西文報紙未經考査眞相，僅憑不正確之報道，遽肆評論，殊表遣憾，該項評論中，有謂我政府忽略剩餘物資之保管，聽其　置露塲，腐蝕銹損，並謂若修建庫房，則此種損耗，胥可避免云云，凡此均屬漢視實情，蓋所有應存入庫物資，吾人早經妥爲處置。其堆放露天者，多爲龐大笨重及不易受潮之機械等物品，或有因物資數量巨大，交換時間短促，一時不及進庫，必須利用露塲者，猶之美方持有物資機關，雖有完善之技術設備，及島上儘多足供建浩庫房之廣大空間，仍將器材堆置露塲。卽因此故，各項外國記老所見到之「銹損腐蝕」物資，遠在未經撥售與我國以前，卽以擱置各島海灘上，爲期兩年，日受泥土封埋，風雨侵蝕，早經銹爛，今竟謂爲完奸物資交來我國後始成廢壤，寗非荒謬。</p>
<p>在一般人想像中，剩餘物資縱然全新，至少當爲仍屬可用狀况，實則美方讓售與我之物資，實質遠不若理想之璀璨，我國於訂約時所希望取得可用或有銷路之物品，至接收後方知所獲僅爲大部份廢料，尤以美方持有機關近數月來所宣佈剩餘之物資，均係保管粗劣，長期露置，或遭偷竊拆毀之廢品，例如最近我物資供應局曾委托上海一美國法律事務所派員赴冲繩島調査，其報吿書中略謂：數百輛機動車，均無引擎及車輪，起重機，牽引機，及平路機等重要機件均遭拆毁，此類廢品，仍悉照完整之機車及建築器材，宣佈剩餘移交我方云云，由此可知破損之剩餘物資，顯非我政府及經手處理機構所能負責，彼不能瞭解我國處理該項物資之艱困，輕率加以指摘，謂爲未能盡保管之責，豈非有失公允。」</p>

<h3>柏林解圍再開外長會議　三強堅持基本原則　中立國調解仍努力進行中　英發表白皮書指責蘇聯在柏林行動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十一日廣播：美發言人謂，美國從未考慮同時解除柏林封鎖及召開四强外長會議之原則。但續稱，美國未嘗採取足以屛除此種解決希望之任何態度。但此不必係美國贊成或有意贊成同時進行之原則。該發言人謂，「三强皆堅持三國對於柏林危機之立塲及進行方法，意見並無二致。企圖調解東西兩方對柏林問題爭議之阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞擬再度會晤維辛斯基，希望能獲得蘇聯對妥協建議之答覆。」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十一日廣播：英美發言人稱，英，法致阿根廷外長之照會，係重申西方列强希望安理會解決柏林僵局之基本原則，該照會明白表示西方列强並不準備與蘇聯直接談判柏林問題，如克林姆宮所希望者。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十一日電〕西方發言人十一日稱，三西方國家對柏林危機之立塲已趨於强硬，並堅持蘇聯須先解除柏林封鎖，彼等始願與蘇商談德國問題。按前時據表示。西方準備接受折表方案，一方面柏林解圍，一方面召集外長會議，硏討德國和約。聯合國對柏林問題　躇不前時，西方乃發表其新發展。消息靈通人士稱，安理會已展期至本週中或週末再續行會議，以待蘇代表維辛斯基對折衷方案之答覆。西方之新行動似已將美代表傑賽普上週三在安理會中所提之折衷建議一筆勾銷。按傑氏之結句爲。「封鎖解除之時，美國卽願立卽出席外長會議，與蘇聯共商有關德國之任何問題」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：英政府十一日發表四萬字長之白皮書。報告柏林危機談判判之經過情形，並聲明英國政府之態度。聲明内指責蘇聯企圖將西方列强逐出柏林，將數千德人拘禁於集中營內，並企圖破壞歐洲之經濟復興。該項聲明與天國九月廿七日發表者大同小異，但内容更爲詳盡，要點如下：（一）蘇聯政府除依據其條件外，並無獲致協議之意向。（二）柏林之蘇當局縱容少數集團，企圖推翻合法之柏林市政府。（三）蘇聯企圖强迫西方佔領國家在壓力下放棄其在柏林之權利。（四）接受蘇聯之條件，無異異將柏林之西方佔區立卽併入蘇聯之經濟體系，並剝除西方佔領國家之權利義務，置柏林全市於蘇聯控制之下。</p>

<h3>高坑礦情</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌六日航訊〕煤礦在萍鄉，已有四十餘年的歷史，但是，煤礦與萍民之間，隔着一條「鴻溝」，迄未消釋，現在仍然有許多不必要的困難，加在礦方，譬如：最近贛西煤礦局的一座一千瓩電機，由城門外搬上火車站時，須要經過一座小橋，那位當地的保長，竟向礦方索取六十億的過橋費，否則，就不准通行。礦方當時允以如小橋被壓燬，可以代建新橋，亦不獲允，迄今數月，此一懸案仍未解決。礦方乃不得已繞道而行，多費了半月的時間和一筆大的搬運費，還沒運到火車站，這是影響煤礦建設的一例。王家源煉焦廠吹出來的煤烟，飛到什麼地方，那些山野草地的主人，竟又提出這些地方被煤烟落下，不能「耕種」要求礦方出價收買這些無用的土地，泉江堰電廠栽植輸供到高坑礦廠去的電桿木，挖一個不到一公尺寬的窟窿，地主亦要求每一桿木的用地，要幾斗穀子。</p>
<p>這些類似的要求，不可勝計，礦方是百般的設法，盡量維持雙方的情感，藉以推進自己的業務。但是，萍人表示，　認爲礦人的待遇優厚，刺激了當地人民的生活。</p>
<p>礦工病例　安源，高坑，從事礦工的負工，有四千人，（除了私人土并在外）目前一個嚴重問題，是醫藥設備與礦工的健康。礦方在高坑設有一個醫療所，由劉展泰醫師主持，內部的设備，因爲房金與經費所限，諸多簡陋，他們每日不分晝夜，應付這些員工的醫療，實是一分難事，每日平均的門診達四百人，他們還得應付礦區週圍四十華里内的出診與當地老百姓的義務代診，劉醫生有時要到半夜才可從礦工住所出診歸來。有一天，泉江堰電廠一位職員眷屬小產，因爲沒有助產土，而劉醫生又是男人，不便進屋，祗好站在窗子外面，隔着窗帘，指揮他的太太代辦手術，胎孩產出，已吿閉氣，幸經施以人工呼吸後，始獲安全，現在是長得又肥又　的小寳寳了。</p>
<p>礦區一般的病例，是痢疾與瘧疾，主要的原因，爲飲水，蚊虫，和吃糙米。據診療所的診斷統計，痢，瘧，要佔患者百分之八十，並且有因由　疾而喪命者。最近亦曾發生一次礦工中煤毒的事件，宰診治及時，總算未釀成慘劇。</p>
<p>改善飲食礦工的生活，是終日勤勞，所獲僅能維持一個單身漢的粗飽。現在高坑與安源從事採礦的地下工作者，大半是湖南人，萍鄉的土著，都是在農暇時當着副業來幹。</p>
<p>他們現在吃的粗糙米，害的是腸胃與痢瘧，所以診療所劉醫師强調改善礦工的飲食，寗願在礦工福利上多化幾文錢，免得支出一筆相當可觀的醫　費，祗要是福利事業能够加强，使這些終日埋身在地下的工作者，能可得到正當的娛樂，精神有適當的寄託，亦可以减少些「賭光吃光」的惡習。</p>
<p>一般的礦工，他們除了在煤窟的工作外，現在尙無適當的組織與娛樂，所以每月發放薪金後，就是盡量的賭吃，祗要自己錢袋裏還剩到一包香烟錢，亦得化光，纔會下窟去工作。現在，一個普通礦工每月的收入，大約是廿元金圓，僅僅能够維持一個人的生活，何况這些苦力之上，還有所謂「包工」，「合作包工」的領工者，一方面須要在礦工身上得一份工資，還要在礦局方面領一份薪資。</p>
<p>礦區是在深山叢林的荒野，那裏除了有幾幢辦公的磚牆，西式洋樓與電廠的烟筒不斷在吐縷縷的烟雲之外，依然保持着中國的農村原始形態，至於文化敎育的建設，还待加倍的努力。</p>
<p>高工遷萍　現在，高坑有一所敎育部撥款，由敎育廳　辦的「高工」，內分採礦與機械兩科，就是因爲適應造就礦冶人才的訓練，乃將「高工」設在高坑，但是房舍的簡陋，使這僅有一年厥史的礦地最高學府，沒法發展，本學期已商得萍鄕縣參議會的同意，將該校遷往萍鄕，暫以縣參會爲校址，繼續招收二班新生。</p>
<p>礦工子弟　煤礦工的員工子弟學校亦設在高坑，現在有三百多學生。礦方的子弟，僅佔三分之一，大多數是，收容附近的失學兒童。他們僅收一點自備的書籍費，其他均由擴方供給，原先當地有二個保學，現已停辦，完全由員工子弟學校接收了這二個學校的學生。</p>
<p>現在礦局的每個職員，最大的苦惱，是公餘之暇，除了上述的缺乏適當娛樂而外，連一張好的報紙亦不易看到。這裏看長沙的新聞紙，最快要四天，上海報紙到這裏，要一星期。在浙贛路沒有通車到株州以前，那就更慢了。最快亦得十天。雜誌一類的刊物，那就須要到萍鄕才能买到。有時，連一枝度骨，一塊香皂，在高坑亦不易買到。</p>
<p>萍鄉文化　然而，記者必須提出：萍鄕是江西文化水準較高的一縣，現在擁有二個省立中等學校和七個縣立與私立中學，縣小的規模，在江西其他縣份，是不易看到，擁有學生一千餘人，敎育經費完全以公產稻穀爲基礎，現在縣中和敖中的一個敎員，每年的待遇，是二百市石白米，若是以現價去折合，可以比上一個特任官，但是，在這些敎師中，有幾位是在大學當過系主任，或是專門敎授，因爲多係萍鄕籍，他們照例要爲桑梓服務，而且可以於敎課之餘，從事個人的進修與著作。</p>
<p>國民敎育的發達，不但完成一保一校的標準，甚至一個保，辦有國民學校四五所之多，而國敎基金，亦完全出諸公產，他們並不要舉辦田賦附加學穀來維持。敎師的水準，大多是高中或是師範出身，在萍鄕不感到國敎師資的缺乏，相反的有許多中學生畢業後的出路，倒成了問題。現在他們大多向鄕鎭工作上找出路，有許多保長，都由中學生來担任一國爲少，故倘謂三國有改變基對希政策之可能時，當以南國之可能性爲較大而亦較平，此則可澯信而無皆者也。（全文完）</p>

<h3>希臘邊亂之國際背景　（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐特約記者</p>
<p>南斯拉夫最近動向</p>
<p>〔上文接本報九日第五版〕當去年聯合國調査希臘邊亂時，認爲南·保·阿三國之中，以南斯拉夫接濟希匪之程度最多。此次巴爾幹委員會巡査結果，在三月間亦認定所謂「以馬柯斯爲首之「希臘民主臨時政府」之我綫電台，卽設於南國境内，故在國際處理希臘問題之時，最爲注意南斯拉夫之態度。加以南國地理形勢之所處，介於阿保二國之間，舉足輕重，牽一髮可動全局。惟自本年六月南國首領狄托與國際共產情報局發生磨擦以後，大有風雨欲來面目全非之概。據最近報吿，南斯拉夫對希匪之救濟，較前已爲减少，所謂「希臘民主臨時政府」之無綫電台亦似已由南國移出。惟表面上南國對希臘之態度，仍以往未見改善，其與巴爾幹委員會之不合作，亦依然如故。惟一般看法，南斯拉夫承此次大戰以後，民主凋敝，經濟至爲脆薄，尤以焦煤與汽油二項，各年需三十萬噸，必須仰給於阿爾巴尼亞及羅馬尼亞，現二國已拒絕供給，故南斯拉夫除非與莫斯科破鏡重圓，方能恢復來源外，勢非在經濟上另謀出路不可。惟以往破裂已深，能否重拾舊歡，殊爲疑問。加以南國对希臘之不和原因原爲馬其頓地區而起。南國希望馬其頓區，成爲傀儡式的自治政權，以便相機併入南斯拉夫聯邦服圖之內，而希匪軍首領馬柯斯則希望以馬其頓爲根據地，樹立赤色政權。保加利亞以地理歷史人種關係，對馬其頓素不忘情，染指之心，與時俱增。故三者敵視希政府之態度雖一而同床異夢，暗礁實深。此次狄托與莫斯科之破綻，雖由於狄托之國家思想置於國際共產主義之上而發生，要亦由於其本國利益，不能與其盟邦協調所致，此在希臘方面，尤爲顯著。最近盛傳，南國與希北邊境之情况，已見好轉，雙方戌兵，互相交談，狀極歡洽。惟以南國與希臘芥蒂之深，及南國目前處境之動盪不定，如謂南國卽能放下屠刀，立地成佛，似尙時機渦早，不能測定。但證以南國旣爲聯合國之會員國，而與希臘又有外交關係，目前援助希匪之程度，亦較其他</p>

<p>自財政經濟緊急處分令頒行以來，穩定一個多月的上海市塲，上週在搶購風潮下，爭先恐後，風起議湧，打破了這沉寂已久的狀態。政府出售物資及若干大商店的貨物，淸晨開門，卽有大批顧客在外等候，一擁而入，二三小時内卽將貨物搶購一空，在這些顧客內，當然單帮客也有，自己消費的也有，此種現象，對於金圓券的信用，實是一大諷刺。我們不應僅僅咒駡這些搶　物資的人，應當要分析風潮發生的原因，從而在根本上消滅它。</p>
<p>第一，搶購風潮發生最根本的原因，當然仍推游資過度鬆濫，始終得不到一條正當的歸宿之路。據金圓劵發行準備監理委員會第二次公吿，截至九月三十日止，共發行金圓券九五六，七五二，四九四·四〇元。另據國行透露，九億餘圓發行額内，收兌金銀外幣支出者，折合美金約一億五千萬元，合六億金圓，收兌法幣及東北劵約五千萬金圓，進出口結匯及僑匯凈收入約美金二千萬元，合八千萬金圓。其餘二億二千萬金圓，則爲改革幣制後之國庫及其他業務支出，當局雖然有意指出，在這鉅大的發行額中，由於財政支出者較少。但游資在市塲上爲害則地，固不問其來源如何。</p>
<p>第二，政府爲增加稅收，平衡預算，經公布整理財政補充辦法，規定對於貨物稅，國產烟酒類稅，及礦產稅之徵收，得加以調整。行政院經濟管制委員會議決，先將捲烟，薰菸烟·錫箔·洋啤酒·國產酒·洋菸葉·土菸絲。於十月一日實施改徵，此項增加稅款，准商人加人貨價發售。滬市自三日起、根據中央提高捲烟及菸葉稅率成數比例調整，計捲烟價格提高百分之一百至一百十一，酒類亦隨同調整。人民因身受多年來高物價的痛苦，心理極度脆弱，於是在意識中，認爲烟酒稅旣可調整，其他稅率以至國營事業售價，均有調整可能，遂形成搶購風潮。　第三，自實施限價以來，滬市管制嚴格，守住八一九限價，外埠管制鬆懈，超過八一九限價，滬市物資早有向外逃避企圖，惟格於管制法令，無法大量移動，在此種情形下，黄牛單帮，遂應運而生，積少成多，對於檢購風潮的形成，亦有甚大影響。</p>
<p>第四，據一般的論斷，自實施限價以來，滬市物價，在金圓已處於一種偏低的狀態中，以致外埠原料土產，畏縮不前。就滬市而言，又有原料高於成品，廠盤高於零售的現象，於是生產萎縮，供應短絀，這不，是形成目前搶購的原因之一·尤其是對於今後新經濟方案的推行·是一個必須克服的障礙。　上週商品市塲方面·由於搶購風潮與來源稀少的關係，多稀商品，均吿停止。紗布市塲早於前週末奉經管決議·暫停交易並商討紗布配售辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）爲防止紗布市價上漲起見，卽日起經管當局命令棉紗及棉布兩市塲停止交易，並嚴厲取締居間商。</p>
<p>（二）准上海每一市民，從十月份起，憑國民身份證購買棉布一丈五尺，身份證上蓋印購買日期，以資識別。三個月內，不能再行購買。</p>
<p>紗布市塲遂自上週一起，全部停頓無市。糧食市塲方面，食米因到貨稀少，北市塲曾停市數日，南市塲陷於半停頓狀態中，計週二南市塲僅到米四四一·五石，週三到四三石，週四到四五三·五石，週五週末南北兩市塲均略到貨，但交易仍可做關。麵粉市塲仍全停，食油亦奉令停市，雜糧雖木全停，但極少做開。日用品方面，捲烟已核准漲價，肥皂火柴僅有零星交易，在限價內，絕少大批成交。絨綫火油則繼捲烟之後，有上漲五成之議，但經管處迄未核准，市勢在僵持中</p>
<p>當局在上週瘋狂的搶購風潮下，最迫切的辦法，當然從限制購買着手，但實施全面的定呈分配制度，雖然高唱已久，却不是一蹴可就，不得已只有退而枝枝節節的應付，計：</p>
<p>（一）實行憑身份證購買布匹，呢絨，絨綫等物品，每人每三個月限購布一丈五尺，每年限購呢絨衣料一套，每年限購粗絨綫一磅半或細絨綫一磅，購後由店家在國民身份證上蓋印，限期内不得再購。社會局業已通知有關各公會，此項憑身份證限購辦法，以後將擴展至綢緞，襯衫，襪子，肥皂等日用物品。</p>
<p>（二）爲限制消費起見，規定實行每星期五不吃肉運動，强制執行。</p>
<p>（三）紙業公會呈准社會局限制購紙，規定已有配紙額者如書商業，彩印業等，不得在紙店購紙。外埠需紙暫時不予供應，個人購紙以五令爲限。</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按用途分類者如次</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如次：</p>
<p>上海區經濟督導員辦公處，自前奉政院令擴大管轄地區後，於七日在京舉行經濟管制會議，通過：（一）加强本區經濟管制　　及聯繫辦法，（二）調節本區重要物資供應辦法，（三）加强本區經濟管理辦法。其中關於詞節物資供應一項，主要於各省市普遍實施民生日用品之定量配售制度，嚴格檢査及登記物資數量，並對產區價格，將予壓低至八一九標準，消　市塲價格太抵者，則根據成本和合法利潤，可由各地方政府之核准，予以合理之調整，同時由政府與商民合作，向產區收購，以充裕物資之來源。同時傳中樞當局，亦正在硏議實施全面配給辦法，該項辦法將仿照英國戰時配售制度，將消費市塲及產區之物資普遍予以檢査登記，然後按實際人數及消費量，予以定量定價憑證配售。</p>
<h3>貸幣·金融　物資早競購，銀根仍鬆濫　頭寸供源盛，暗息續下落</h3>
<p>上週本市銀根，鬆濫的情形，不但未見稍斂，而且更有變本加厲。自烟酒價格提高一倍以後，市塲上卽普遍發生競購物資的現象，週初，單子的搜求，因之一度轉殷，而業內行莊的存戶，亦紛紛提存，以轉購物資。但行莊方面，一邊是消費者存款的急劃减少，一邊却是店舖存款的大量增加。例如太市六十號以後行莊交換結果，週一雖差出四十五萬元，但週二却又吿差進一百萬元，可見業内頭寸供源旺盛之一般。週三以後，各業買賣成交稀落，需單又轉衰，於是市間頭寸之供給又遠遠超過了頭寸的需求，游資在轉輾無出路的情况下，又安得不泛濫。</p>
<p>據估計蝟集於太市的游資已經在六億元以上了，因此當局也着了慌，週二起，命令國家行局停止公佈交換差額，以鎭壓浮動的人心，同時，據悉嗣後市塲暗息，亦將勒令禁刊；然而一方面儘管停止公佈交換差額，一方面據報載，國家行局仍每天平均維持數百萬元的差出，銀根所以鬆濫如故，這也是主因之一。</p>
<p>物資搶購或逃避的結果，好多商舖的存貨變得零零落落了，但就整調市塲看，由於物價籌碼的未見掛高，游資不過從一些人的手裏，轉移到另外一些人的手裏，所以搶購物資不但不足以减少游資，而且竟由於物資的進一步接近消費領域，而增加了銀根鬆濫的威脅。至於可以使銀根抽緊一時的短期庫劵，及國營事業股票的銷售等等，一週來的銷售量不過千萬元光景，自然對銀根的抽緊，不會發生什麼作用。據報載，這種局面乃是游資收縮無方，政府控制莫能的表示，的確，一次極嚴竣的考騐，已經擺在新幣制的前面了。</p>
<p>上週暗息，週初雖因頭寸需求轉設而一度升至月息六分與九分之間，（前週末爲四分半至五分四之間），但週三起又見盤降至五分左右。至於銀錢業掛牌利息，週二再見下落，計存息自一分五降至一分三厘五，欠息自四分八降至三分九，同業拆息自三分降至二分四。貨方貼息，每元日拆在二三元左右，合月息爲六分至九分之間。　國家行局交換結果，據報載，週一爲四百廿八萬元，週二亦有四五百萬元，週三降至百萬左右，週四仍維持數百萬元的出數。</p>
<p>外商銀行交換結果，週一差進一百十七萬元，週二約進八十萬元，週三週四仍見差進。商業行莊頭寸仍一致鬆裕，六十號以後行莊交換結果，除週一實出一百餘萬元以外，嗣後至週四均吿差進，頭寸供源之旺盛，可以槪見</p>
<p>上週商業行莊內匯匯率，頗見穩定，廣州匯水爲廿四元，厦匯匯水二元，電慶，昆明等地匯水爲十二元，漢口十元，平津五元。外匯行市，官價無變動，本市銀樓業因飾金來源無着，已自動停止金飾之買賣。</p>
<p>香港行市，黄金每華兩前週週末爲三百〇九港元又五角，上週週一升至三百十六元五角，週三再昂見三百十九元。香港美鈔市價，前週週末爲五港元又二角一分，上週週一升至五元二角半，至週三再升爲五元三角三分。</p>
<h3>工商動態　限價下的工商業</h3>
<p>行政院經濟管制委員會，最近通過全國各地捲烟·薰烟葉。洋啤酒·錫箔·國產酒·菸絲·菸葉。等七種貨物稅稅率，自十月二日起，平均提高百分之七十至一百。據蔣督導員表示，如此則政府每月可增加收入三千四百萬金圓，可見稅率之調整，政府勢在必行。一週來本市搶購物資的風起雲湧，烟酒價格的調整，當爲近因之一。於此亦不難看出政府的收入雖增加了，工商界却再一次的受到了驚濤駭浪的襲擊。除此以外，財部爲了增加政府的收入，棉花的進口稅與紗布出口稅亦提高了，紡織品外銷委員會，認爲此足以打擊紡織工業，而呈請工商部及財政部予以减免；顯而易見，稅率减少令影響政府的收入，故减稅申請的能否成功，也是難以樂觀的。</p>
<p>政府爲增加其收入，國營事業於上週又醞釀漲價了；某立法委員說得好，國營事業如不加價，則政府將活不了，顯然，國營事業自非漲價不可了。</p>
<p>除此而外，太市公用事業，也已發生困難，據報載：自公用事業售價凍結後，各公司因汽油配價提高，成本加重而發生極大之困難。再如公用事業所需燃煤而論，十月份配煤雖已由供應上海部份撥給，但今後煤源，據說　皇島煤已無法運輸，開灤煤礦雖有存煤五十萬噸，但因交通阻碍，本月僅能運來二萬噸，其他如淮南·塘沽新港之煤亦祇腦溢血數運和，而此間存量尙不到四五萬噸，爲此公用事業方而特電呈中央請求恢復貼補，但貼補能否核准，恐怕也有問題，不幸如此，則公用事業繼國營事業之後，作價格上之調整，也是勢在必行了</p>
<p>要限價政策貫澈不變，原料的充裕供應，自然是主要的條件之一，經濟督導處在這方面也盡了最大的努力，如限制物資出境，舉行倉庫總檢査，以及文字的宣傳等等；但當局對物資的掌握，又是非常急切的，例如中國農民銀行代理糧食部收購麵粉，前後已辦理過六次，共計收購三百六十二萬包，另如中信局已會同榨油廠，展開了收購菜籽的工作。據中央社消息：該局已派員分赴江浙皖生產區，預計在一個月內，可收足六萬五千擔菜籽。這許多當局所收購的物資，工商界方面是否能配給到一部份，固然是一個問題，而其他生產所需的原料，據悉目前除燃料部份，柴油已經輸管會汽柴油分配委員會，決定對工業界所需作全部供應外，採購均甚困難。別的不說，如毛紡業原料，據現經社訊，本市毛紡工業所屬會員七十七家所存之原料，僅够用一個多月。再如植物油之生產，據中植油廠當局表示，九月份產量雖以原料存底尙豐，而與八月產量相近，但十月份因原料無着，產量就有問題了。</p>
<p>雖然，此次競購物資的大風浪，其遠因固然是金圓券的源源流出，其近因則爲一部份貨物稅率的增加，與生產原料供應的匱乏；工商界前途顯然是困難重重，因爲縱然工業原料的存量，確如經管辦公處發言人所說，可敷數月之用，但假如金圓券的發行與稅率的調整，尙無一適當的限度，那末所謂搶購物資的「心理因素」，恐怕仍是一種難予醫治的沉疴。</p>

<h3>姑蘇小游</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>半年沒有到蘇州去，情形有點兩樣。火車站畔的人力車夫少極，恐怕是早已被　湧而來的旅客一掃而空了的；勉强呌到一輛馬車，從車站呌到　門公共汽車站，索價兩元。到了公共汽車站，候車的人已經擠得滿滿一大堆，車一到，大家湧上去，門口狹小，一下子難以擠進，幾個兵老爺就從車窗口爬，這形勢非常險惡，我雖然在上海積了十餘年擠電車的經騐，也難與頡頏。倒是方才乘坐的那輛馬車來兜生意，說·「還是坐馬車去吧。」結果當然是跳上了馬車……</p>
<p>從　門到胥門一段路中間，這輛馬車有免費搭乘特殊人物的義務，一會兒跳上來，一會兒又跳下去；如其不讓他搭，就要怒目相向。可是一過盤門，車行到公路上，搭車人就絕跡了。</p>
<p>蘇州的蒼蠅特別多，嗡嗡嗡，老是繞着馬車，從蘇州乘白車一直到木瀆，揮之不去，飛了又來。深秋了，蒼蠅在蘇州的潛勢力還是很厲害，一到木瀆飯館裏，全是蒼蠅，圍繞着桌子飛來飛去，和游客的營營擾擾一般。</p>
<p>上靈嚴，風物依舊，在山上看到一個大胖子游山，一肩竹輿，由四名粗壯鄕婦扛抬，大胖子受竹輿的簸動，還是羿得氣喘咻咻。同伴說，這不是大胖游山，乃是我們看到城隍出巡，此情此景，確有七分神似。</p>
<p>山頂有買可口可樂者，索似三角五分，問他可照限價出售否？回答是這裏沒有限價。好一個逍遙法外的黑市交易地！</p>
<p>到半山，才可以望到遠處一片湖光，隱隱有風帆沙鳥，只是太遠一點，僅有遼闊之感而缺乏親切情調，此所以靈嚴終不及而頭渚也。</p>
<p>從靈岩到虎邱，又是一段長長的馬車路程，車上人喊寂寞，馬夫說，這幾年都是你們上海人不好，「要快，要快！」弄得馬車的生意都沒有了。其實呢，蹄聲得得中在秋深的公路上馳驅，情景也正復不惡。蒼蠅仍舊躱在馬夫背上和旅客身旁；馬車像如來佛的掌心，蒼蠅飛不出去。後來我用游山竹杖痛剿，經過十餘分鐘在空中揮動，居然蒼蠅全面潰退，不再在周圍騷擾。</p>
<p>虎邱塔的傾斜度，差可與比薩媲美，整個風景區已入於遲暮之境，缺少人工的栽培與維護，風景也會老的。倒是山塘街的小河，使我們想起了民間故事三笑姻緣的流風餘韻，同伴中正有六如居士的後裔，頗以其豐神俊朗，得之於「老祖母」的遺傳而沾沾自喜。</p>
<p>馬車進城，在觀前街口又跳上了一個小兵。馬夫說到玄妙觀就要停下來，他回答：只要搭車到玄妙觀而已。他講的一口四川話，T便以四川鄉音和他攀談，據說當了十年小兵，窮得想回鄕一次的盤費都沒有。坐車者固然討厭搭車人，但他們除了搭車以外，實在也沒有餘資當車錢用。而且他們視搭車如娛樂，從察院塲到正山門短短一段路之間，他們也以一「搭」為樂。</p>
<p>商店在六時紛紛打烊，使我回想到昔年戰時蘇州的陰沉氣象。松鶴樓的客人愈來愈擠，幸虧跑堂的爐火純靑，對於心急的食客肯低聲下氣地對答，使顧客無從和他們火冒。晚飯後上火車還早，溜到北局大光明，看了一小時「水蓮公主」，完全是Dilling　time也。</p>
<p>九時正離影院，回到觀前街上，只見松鶴樓門前警衛森嚴，圍觀的人一大堆，據說是有人來吃飯，因不能供應而大閙一塲，遠傷了幾個人。我們幸虧早一點吃晚飯，沒有作為池魚，亂世風光，如此而已。</p>
<h3>記趙堯生</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>前幾天·太報成都專電，報導「川耆宿趙熙病逝」，老成凋謝，不禁憮然。</p>
<p>趙堯生（熙），別署香宋，詩詞書畫，享盛名數十年。他在宣統末年，由翰林院編修轉江西道監察御史，那時恰値郵傳部尙書盛宣懷奏准借了外款，主張鐵路收歸國有。淸酋接納盛的條陳，宣布鐵路政策，幹路均歸國有，支路准商民量力興築。以前批准鐵路各案，一概取銷，如抗卽以違旨論罪。因此，惹起四川的鐵路風潮。趙氏便和歐家廉站在御史的本位，提出彈劾盛宣懷。由此，趙的直聲，傳遍全國。不久，滿淸傾覆，他到杭州住了些時，仙回四川榮縣故鄉去，借着吟詩塡詞，寫字作畫，來消遣歲月。對於川劇的改良，也很努力，常把舊劇改編，劇情詞句，重新刪訂，如「活捉王魁」改做「情探」之類，就是一例。</p>
<p>川中有幾位耆宿，如顏楷，方旭·宋育仁·尹昌衡·廖平·徐子休等·社會呌他們為五老七賢·他也是其中之一。十多年前·他們對於省政和地方事業，常常聯名發表意見，來盡地方父老的責任。在軍閥割據期間，此起彼落，各踞一方，無惡不作，但對他們幾位老頭子，却很恭敬。有一次，四川發生內戰，在榮縣開火，但是雙方的軍事長官相約不在東門附近巷戰，因為趙氏是住在東門的。趙覆友人費君的信有說：「敝縣山區，此次兩軍將近三十萬人，卽食粟亦愁竭澤。……一鐘輒死七八百人（兩軍傷亡約五萬人）。不佞幸為兩軍上將維護，門以內書硯秩然，不知有事。然坐砲海中，彈聲如雨，頭上如餓鴟之鳴，機關槍，劈擊砲，城中巷戰，山搖地動矣。避難者時集寒家，有時官兵亦爾。當時可榜心太平齋，事後追思，魂悸魄栗也。」</p>
<p>趙氏詩功湛深，蒼秀密栗，做的很快。不知的多以為他的詩是苦吟而成，其實是脫口而出，不加錘鍊的。楊增犖調職四川，趙做竹枝詞三十首送行，描寫自湖北而至成都的入蜀山水。陳衍請趙寫入橫幅，趙再加頭尾四首贈陳。第二天，陳訪趙，趙的送行詩，又擴增成了六十首。陳和楊見着都深深的拜服。</p>
<p>十多年前，我和他通訊中，提到程白袈近况，他們以前本極相好，後來音書隔絕，雙方都很懷念。趙氏接讀我的信後，卽寫七絕兩首給我。詩云：「老去流光到夕陽，舊年紅樹幾經霜；雲頭靑雀無消息，腸斷斑　系陸郞。一札因風省白袈，故人漂泊尙夫涯；楓橋小泊瀟瀟雨，休向吳娘探藕花！」</p>
<p>梁啟超生平工於論文，不大作詩，後來做詩，最佩服的是趙氏。因之，每有寫詩，必寄請訂正。從梁的遺著中有幾首五霄長句寄趙堯生的，便知梁對趙的推崇備至了。</p>
<h3>解連環　金陵懷古</h3>
<p>— 內紹竑</p>
<p>秣陵秋晚，正銀河瀉影，月痕淸淺；溯舊迹，歷劫紅羊，　蕪殿明宮，草平山遠·寂寞長空，浄映下素心一片·論百年過了，石頭知否，歲時冷煖？秦淮夜殘漏轉，聽後庭商女，載歌成怨·怨只怨肉食帷謀，便淮上防空，橫江練斷；故轍當前，莫又是一番錯算！待將這扇底桃花，敎誰重演？</p>
<h3>木蘭花慢</h3>
<p>暝陰凝不解，又秋雨撲連宵。便客袖吟寒，稠情欲寄，萬縷千條·滿瀟，吹沉瀛嶼，忍餘香，浪抹萍飄。眼睇珠傾華蓋，待停聽雨蘭橈。明朝，望斷湖橋。長亭柳漾遙遙。料別留離誰綰，空留別夢，夢也無聊。笙簫，漫傳幽怨，怕催歸聲裏暗魂銷！剩有餘醒未買，再來酒暖旗招。</p>
<h3>美國點滴</h3>
<p>— 仲堅</p>
<p>今日美國職員婦女已不復是專為針綫錢而工作，百分之八十四都是為了養活自己或家人而工作了。這是勞工部長席威倫巴克的報吿。</p>
<p>美國陸軍皮鞋已改變了樣式，在鞋頭小趾側加寬了八分之一吋，其目的在「增進足的衛生」。這是一九一二年以來的第一次改樣。</p>
<p>聯邦安全處的報吿：美國生育率連年上升，一九四七年生育嬰兒三百九十一萬名，比已往的最高紀錄一九四六年多出四十四萬名。</p>
<p>美國通貨膨脹未已，私立大學收支不能平衡，紛紛提高學費。雅魯大學每年學費從四百五十元漲為六百元；哥倫比亞大學的學費提高三分之一，宿舍費提高百分之十七；科爾介特大學學費提高百分之二十。</p>
<p>勞工統計局發表：今年五月份美國生活費用上漲千分之七，比一九三五至一九三九年間的平均數上漲百分之七十點五。</p>
<h3>偽指紋</h3>
<p>— 南無</p>
<p>近代偵緝人員對指紋都極予重視，手槍柄上一個指紋往往能够强有力的指出誰是凶犯，那個被指為怨犯的人卽使極口呼寃，司法當局也往往不加理睬——誰呌他留下了那個指紋呢？</p>
<p>但是，近幾年來，美國的警探們對指紋的觀念已經頗有改變，原因是：（一）指紋竟然可以偽造；（二）有時還可以利用別人的指紋來為非作惡，而有那指紋的本人竟可以完全矇在鼓裏，毫不知曉。換言之，就是：以前有「栽贓」，現在有「栽指紋」。</p>
<p>不久之前，支加哥有一個珠寳商，對偽造指紋極感興趣，暇時常常假造幾套指紋作為消遣。後來他以妨害社會安寗罪入獄，和監獄的典獄官倒相處得很好。他就吿訴那個典獄官說，他能够偽造指紋，希望典獄官能　讓他把這件絕技公開表演讓可法界和硏究犯罪學的專家們作為參考。那個典獄官聽了他的話，認為完全是荒唐無稽之談，倒把他譏諷了一陣。那個珠寳商祗好於失望之餘，安心的繼續坐牢了。</p>
<p>幾天之後，他又去找那位典獄官了。走進典獄官的辦公室時，却見空無一人，原來那位典獄官正巡監未回。辦公室裏有一只保險箱。那個珠寳商靈機一動，開了保險箱，拿出了一點錢，悄然走開。到了明天，典獄官發現保險箱裏少了鈔票，不禁大驚，馬上呌來了警察，警探們用顯微鏡一看，竊賊在保險箱的門上留下了淸淸楚楚的指紋——仔細一查，却是典獄官的兒子的指紋！</p>
<p>那個典獄官正在又羞又氣哭笑不得的時候，那個珠寳商走了進來，他把錢還了典獄官，特別聲明他做這件事的目的就是　讓　探們知道：指紋是可以偽造，而且可以「移植」的。那位典獄官聽了這番話自然是如釋重負，而精明幹練的美國警探們却從此對指紋又有了一個新的認識。</p>
<h3>讀者</h3>
<p>讀本報六日所報上海市社會一般生活情形，三輪車夫每日可獲金圓十元！月計則三百元，比簡任官優越多多。（六百元俸者纔一百二十餘元。）北平亦有「拉車的關過坐車的」之風謠。平市之兩輪車（俗呼洋車，又曰膠皮，上海所謂黃包車）已淘汰殆盡，遍地「三輪」，業此者曰「登三輪」，但對雇車者仍說「拉到何處？」一因習慣，二則「登到何處」不成一語也。</p>
<p>北平雇車討價，向來有其特別之單位。民國初年，都講多少「子兒」，近者三五個「子兒」，遠者一二十個「子兒」，所謂「子兒」，即銅元，南方謂之「銅板」，「銅角子，」北方謂之「銅子兒」，省言「子兒」，以此為計數之單位。惟東交民巷之洋車，開口論「毛」，上車起碼一毛，即小洋一角。一因拉洋人特別貴族氣，坐車掏「毛」錢，不在乎。二則交民巷之洋車比較乾凈華麗，車夫亦較為精神快捷，大概是承應洋主顧之故。中國人在交民巷雇車，自然亦循洋例，以「毛」計價，故彼時有「毛」與「子兒」兩單位。直到抗戰以前亦還是這兩單位，中間雖因生活程度漸高，價亦漸漲，不過幾個「子兒」漲到幾十「子兒」，一兩毛者漲到三四毛，總不離乎「毛」與「子兒」。雖然銀行或貨店計賬有幾毛幾分乃至幾釐，但洋車夫則無說「分」之習慣，「子兒」之外，就是「毛」。</p>
<p>現在情形，有些相仇，因為張口不是「幾毛」（金元也），就是「幾十萬」（法幣也）。兩個單位，「萬」與「毛」，向來沒有幾分幾分的說法，豫計十一月底，舊法幣兌盡之後，只「毛」為單位無疑。</p>
<p>現在雇「三輪」，最短的路，至少一毛。若宣武門到西單牌樓，則須兩毛。昨見一雇車趣事，討價只「兩毛」，還價却是「五十萬元」。其他買物討價「一元」，還價一百二十萬元（卽四角），是常有的事，令人解頤。</p>
<p>平市之公共汽車，因賠累不堪而停辦，其汽車亦拍賣而還債了。電車勉强維持，而多破舊欠修，奄奄一息·「行」的問題，惟自己的兩腿可恃。</p>
<p>三輪車更成為可居之「奇」。北城到南城，一元或八毛。每人日進十餘金，不足為奇。三輪不似兩輪拉車之費力如牛馬，故日巡南北十餘遍亦不至過累也。</p>

<h3>President's Address on National Day: Elucidating the Current Path to National Reconstruction and Encouraging All Citizens to Fulfill Their Responsibility in Suppressing the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Republic of China's 37th National Day commemoration was solemnly held in the Presidential Palace on the morning of the 10th. President Chiang personally presided over the ceremony, with Vice President Li, as well as more than 400 central civil and military officials, including Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Boling, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, and He Yingqin, participating. The interior and exterior of the Presidential Palace's auditorium were decorated with lanterns and colored ribbons, creating a brilliant and renewed atmosphere. The President, wearing the Grand Cordon of the Colored Jade Medal, arrived at precisely 10:00 AM and delivered an impromptu speech. He first recounted the difficulties faced by the Founding Father and the martyrs in creating the Republic and the arduousness of the current task of national reconstruction. The President expressed optimism about the future of national reconstruction and emphasized that the path to national reconstruction must follow the teachings of the Founding Father and implement the Three Principles of the People. The President pointed out that the Communist bandits are enemies of nationalism, and their goal is to eliminate the Chinese nation. At this critical juncture when the fate of the nation is at stake, all members of the government should be especially vigilant, strive together, and recognize that suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion is the implementation of nationalism. They should not fear dangers or difficulties, and should work together in military and political affairs to fulfill the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. The full text of the President's speech is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Urgent Task is to Complete Nationalism</h3>
<p>Today is the 37th National Day of our Republic of China. Reflecting on thirty-seven years ago, our Founding Father led the revolutionary martyrs and the compatriots of the whole country to fight arduously and unitedly, overthrowing the rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty for more than two hundred and sixty years, abolishing the autocratic political system of thousands of years, and establishing the Republic of China. This is the most glorious and greatest historical achievement in the history of our Chinese nation. Today, as we approach this glorious anniversary, recalling the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of our Founding Father and the martyrs, and returning to the responsibilities we should fulfill, we feel an even greater burden. Only by being of one heart and one mind, and continuing to work hard to complete the unfinished cause of the Founding Father, can we comfort the spirits of the Founding Father and the martyrs in heaven.</p>
<p>The Republic of China was founded by the Founding Father himself. The Founding Father's Three Principles of the People are the principles of our national reconstruction. For more than fifty years, the sacrifice and struggle of the revolutionary martyrs have been entirely for the realization of the Three Principles of the People. This March, we convened the National Assembly and, according to the Constitution, established a constitutional government. The implementation of the Principle of Democracy has thus achieved initial success. From then on, the Republic of China began to be a republic that lived up to its name. The Founding Father once said that the Republic of China before the thirteenth year (of the Republic) was only a Republic in name, without the substance of a Republic, because warlords and bureaucrats stole political power. From the thirteenth year to the present, twenty-four years have passed. During these twenty-four years, although our country has encountered difficulties and hardships unprecedented in the national reconstruction period of any country, our government and people have always been united in striving to realize the Three Principles of the People, and finally established a Republic of China that lives up to its name. This arduous and outstanding achievement deserves our celebration and can further strengthen our confidence in the future of national reconstruction. Since the Principle of Democracy can achieve success, the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood will naturally not be difficult. As long as our government and people can follow the teachings of the Founding Father, work together in unity, and strive to promote it, we can naturally enter a state of people's livelihood, prosperity, and happiness.</p>
<p>What I want to remind our government colleagues and compatriots across the country today is that our most pressing task at present is to complete nationalism. Everyone knows that the completion of nationalism is the prerequisite for realizing the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood. Only with national independence and the guarantee of survival can democracy and people's livelihood be realized. If nationalism cannot be realized, then democracy cannot develop, and people's livelihood cannot be promoted. The entire country and nation will be reduced to slaves and beasts of burden for foreign races. In the Xinhai Revolution, we overthrew the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and everyone thought that this was the success of nationalism. Later, there was the invasion of Japanese imperialists. After the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone thought that the Founding Father's nationalism could be fully realized, but today it proves that this is not entirely true. Today, the enemies of our nation still exist, and they are very insidious and stubborn. Eliminating this enemy is more difficult than overthrowing the Manchu Qing Dynasty and defeating Japan, because the Manchu Qing Dynasty and Japan were foreign enemies, their targets were clear, and they were easy to recognize. The compatriots of the whole country suffered the pain of their trampling and oppression, and naturally rose up to resist with the same hatred and indignation, and would never be deceived or fooled by them. Today, the enemies of our nation are the insidious and vicious Communist bandits. The Communist bandits wear the false mask of Chinese people and act as the Fifth Column of international organizations to kill their compatriots. On the surface, they chant slogans of democracy and freedom, but in reality, everything they do is to destroy China's democracy and freedom. Because they are also Chinese, their crimes of acting as accomplices for tigers are difficult to identify. Because they are skilled in deceptive propaganda, their conspiracies and tricks are not only difficult for ordinary citizens to identify, but even intellectuals are often fooled by them and echo them, and the government's work of suppressing the rebellion encounters significant obstacles. Therefore, I believe that since the Founding Father led the National Revolution, we have only encountered the final enemy today, and nationalism has only encountered the final test. At this final juncture when the fate of our country and nation hangs in the balance, to avoid the tragic fate of becoming slaves and beasts of burden, we must raise our vigilance, recognize the true face of the Communist bandits, and give full play to our conscience of loving our country and our nation, fight with the same hatred and indignation, and sacrifice and struggle to eliminate this final enemy, ensure the unity and independence of our country, and then can we truly realize the Founding Father's Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3>The Future Situation of Suppressing the Bandits: Military Suppression of the Rebellion Cannot be Completed in a Few Months or a Year or Two; Everyone Should Strengthen Solidarity and Strive to Eliminate the Enemy</h3>
<p>When the constitutional government was established in the first half of this year, I estimated that the banditry south of the Yellow River would be cleared up before November. However, it is now October, and not only has the banditry south of the Yellow River not been cleared up, but recently Jinan was also captured by the bandit army. This is the greatest misfortune for the country and the thing I personally feel most ashamed of. Why did I make this estimate at the time? It was because I imagined that after the implementation of the Constitution, the compatriots of the whole country would all assume political responsibility and would surely unify their will and concentrate their strength to enhance the work of suppressing the rebellion and banditry. However, later facts were completely contrary to the ideal. The reason for this is that people who have not suffered from the banditry are misled by the Communist bandits' false propaganda, thinking that the Communist bandits are also Chinese and that they are also implementing democracy and freedom. Therefore, they feel that the Communist bandits' rebellion is just an ordinary civil strife and will not be as cruel and terrifying as the Japanese imperialists. Because everyone has this misconception in their minds, their will cannot be concentrated, their spirits tend to be lax, and their strength cannot be brought into play, so that in the past six months, our military suppression of the bandits has not achieved the effect of military and civilian cooperation and has suffered many setbacks. This is the main reason for our failure. If we do not reflect on this today, if we do not correct this mentality of following the old ways and hoping for luck in the past, if we do not recognize that the Communist bandits are the enemy of our entire nation, and if we do not realize the danger of national subjugation and racial extinction, and thus unite our hearts and minds, fight with the same hatred and indignation, and make a life-and-death決鬥 (jue dou, duel), then the future situation of suppressing the bandits will be even more difficult and serious than it is now. The Founding Father often said, "Spirit is superior to matter." Today, the success or failure of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation depends only on a change of mind. If we can reflect on the reasons for failure, remember the lessons of the past, and from now on unite our spirits, concentrate our strength, and strive to fight, then the more dangerous our revolutionary environment, the more arduous our work, and the more rapid our success. This is evidenced by the revolutionary history of the past thirty years. No matter how difficult and arduous the times, as long as we can follow the principles and the responsibilities of the revolution, regardless of all sacrifices, taking risks and overcoming difficulties, and never giving up, we will eventually succeed. On the contrary, the reason why the Communist bandits are bound to fail is because they only shout slogans of revolution, but in fact have no revolutionary spirit at all, only engage in opportunism and seek personal gain at the expense of others, and will eventually harm themselves and others and move towards self-destruction. Because we have this spirit of taking risks, overcoming difficulties, and working hard, the more difficulties we encounter, the greater the chance of success. In the past six months, we have indeed revealed many weaknesses and shortcomings, discovered many mistakes, and encountered many unexpected difficulties, but this is undoubtedly a favorable phenomenon. The exposure of weaknesses is the data for our reflection, the discovery of mistakes is the beginning of our improvement, and temporary setbacks are the foundation for our turning defeat into victory. As long as we can continue to reform and continue to progress, we will eventually achieve the goal of success. Of course, the military suppression of the Communist bandits in the future cannot be completed in a short period of a few months or a year or two. However, the ancients said, "Born in sorrow, die in ease." The more overlapping the sorrows, the more we should invigorate our aspirations and cultivate new forces. As long as all members of our government and compatriots across the country can reflect and awaken, eliminate the accumulated bad habits of following the old ways, being slack, and being disorganized and extravagant, unite our spirits, cooperate fully, be self-reliant and self-strengthening, then the weaknesses of the bandits will inevitably be gradually exposed, and they will eventually fail. In the past, the Communist bandits exaggerated and claimed that they could overthrow our government this year, but now they plan to extend the rebellion to five years. Everyone must know that time is the factor of our victory. The longer the time, the more the weaknesses of the Communist bandits are exposed, the deeper the people's understanding of their true nature, and the closer the time of their failure. Now the people in the bandit areas have a deep hatred for the rule of the treacherous bandits. Wherever they cannot control it militarily, the people will immediately rise up to resist. This proves that the Communist bandits are the common enemy of our entire country and nation, regardless of region or occupation. Under our strong and deep national consciousness, they will inevitably be eliminated. All members of our government and compatriots across the country must recognize the difficulty of the situation and the magnitude of our own responsibilities. From now on, no matter which department of the government or any sector of society, we must concentrate our efforts to strengthen our military suppression of the bandits, be diligent and vigilant in our work, be thrifty and frugal in our lives, and be harmonious and cooperative in political and economic affairs, cooperate with each other, unite closely, and intensify our efforts under the same goal to eliminate the enemies of our nation and implement the Founding Father's nationalism. Only when nationalism is fully realized can the implementation of democracy and the principle of people's livelihood be guaranteed and successful. These are my thoughts on today's National Day commemoration, which I use to encourage myself, my colleagues, and my compatriots across the country. I hope that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind to complete our mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. (The End)</p>
<h3>Director of the Shandong Social Affairs Department Arrives in Nanjing to Report: Wang Yaowu Dies in a Breakout Attempt; His Body is Buried by the People; Claims of Capture Are Absolutely Incorrect</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] "General Wang Yaowu indeed died in a breakout attempt during the Jinan campaign, and the reported news of his capture is absolutely incorrect." This was the report given by Wang Pingyi, director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Social Affairs, at the Shandong Provincial Association in Nanjing on the 10th. Wang disguised himself and escaped from Jinan on September 29th, four days after Jinan fell, and arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 10th after experiencing many hardships. According to Wang, "General Wang Yaowu accidentally fell into a camouflaged machine gun bunker while inspecting the positions on the city wall of Jinan at 3:00 PM on the 21st, and injured his right kneecap. The injury was very serious, and he needed to be supported to move. In the afternoon of the 23rd, when I had dinner with Chairman Wang in the provincial government, Wang's attitude was still very calm, and the officers and soldiers under his command were also in high spirits. In the afternoon of the 24th, the street fighting was very fierce, and Chairman Wang went to the Beijige heights in the city to command the battle, and I lost contact with him. On the 29th, when I escaped to the Huangtai Railway Station Huayuanzhuang in the east of Jinan city, I met a staff member of the Social Affairs Department's porridge factory who told me that Chairman Wang led a small number of troops and broke out of the city at 8:00 AM on the 27th, encountered bandits west of Huangtai Bridge, and died in battle on the spot. The accompanying guards were also sacrificed, and Chairman Wang's body has been buried by the local people." Wang continued, "On the 26th, the Communist bandits in Jinan city widely rumored that they had captured four Wang Yaowus, and three places in the local Communist bandits near Jinan also reported that they had captured Wang Yaowu. At that time, any middle-aged person with a short, stout body and a dark complexion could be mistaken for Wang Yaowu. In Shouguang County, the 'Wang Yaowu' detained by the bandits was actually a retired old county magistrate, who confessed to being Wang Yaowu because he could not bear the torture of the Communist bandits. The bandits publicized this widely, but when he was taken to Jinan, they realized he was not the one. As of the time I left Jinan, the Communist bandits were still searching for Chairman Wang's whereabouts."</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Opens Its Tenth Meeting Today: Continuing to Discuss Financial and Economic Proposals; Li Yu and Others Propose to Quickly Improve Food Rationing</h3>

<h3>President Chiang Presides Over KMT Memorial Week, Explains General Situation of Politics, Economy, and Military; Current Situation Indeed Perilous But Absolutely Not Pessimistic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Central Headquarters of the Kuomintang held an enlarged memorial week for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 11th. In addition to Central Committee members and heads of various Yuan and ministries, KMT members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans were also invited to participate. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting and explained the current general situation of politics, economy, and military. A summary of his remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>Do Not Forget Our Position and Responsibility During the Extraordinary Revolutionary Period</p>
<p>Some people believe that the current national situation has reached an unprecedented level of danger. I also acknowledge that the current political, economic, and military situations are quite serious, but they are by no means as severe as some people imagine. Everyone must understand that the present is an extraordinary revolutionary period. We must observe all issues from a revolutionary standpoint and with a revolutionary historical perspective. As long as everyone does not forget their revolutionary position and responsibility and can maintain the traditional revolutionary spirit and confidence, we will never be pessimistic about the current situation. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen said: "Revolutionary power, spiritual ability, accounts for nine-tenths, while material ability accounts for only one-tenth." It is evident that the success or failure of the revolution depends entirely on our mental fortitude. As long as our minds are strong and our spirits are high, any danger can be overcome, and any difficulty can be broken. Since the "September 18th Incident," our nation has faced many hardships for seventeen years. It is natural that the public's mental state cannot be normal, and their nerves have become fragile. Party comrades have the responsibility to lead society and must demonstrate a spirit of great courage to stabilize the people's minds and the current situation.</p>
<p>The Press Should Not Report News That Stimulates Public Anxiety</p>
<p>The perceived danger of the current situation far exceeds the actual facts, and the rumors that are spread are often exaggerated and do not reflect the truth. During my recent inspection tour, I passed through Peiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Shanghai. In Peiping and Tianjin, newspapers daily reported on the panic buying in Peking, Shanghai, and other places, how the people were panicked, and how social order was almost impossible to maintain. Later, upon returning to Shanghai, I learned that although there had been panic buying in Shanghai, the situation had returned to normal after only two days. However, the northern newspapers exaggerated the situation. Similarly, the Shanghai newspapers reported on how serious the panic buying was in Peiping and Tianjin. In fact, in Peiping, except for one incident of people scrambling to buy grain at Tianqiao, the other markets were very calm. This example shows that many things in society today are not actually serious; they are merely exaggerated, causing mutual anxiety. I hope that the press will pay special attention to this and not report news that stimulates public anxiety as a means of increasing circulation. Instead, they should assume the responsibility of leading public opinion under the premise of national and ethnic interests, and jointly seek social stability and progress.</p>
<p>Military Authorities Should Act Proactively and Not Be Constrained</p>
<p>In military affairs, for the past three months, the national army has been at a disadvantage almost everywhere. The reason for this is that the military authorities are too concerned. The most important thing in military affairs is to be proactive. As the ancients said, "The key to successful deployment lies in the mind." The military authorities must not be constrained or interfered with by any party, so that they can act as they wish and command freely. To remedy this deficiency, everyone must trust the commander-in-chief and grant them full command authority. Only then can they comprehensively plan for attack and defense, speed and delay, adapt to strategies, concentrate forces, and seize the initiative. Military affairs must not be constrained by politics, which would lead to passivity or failure.</p>
<p>As for the international situation, the current situation is indeed very tense, but we still have strong confidence in the United Nations. We must be self-reliant and strong, and respond to changes with constancy. Therefore, we feel even more the need to complete national unification.</p>
<p>The Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans Must Work Together as a Whole</p>
<p>In summary, I believe that the current situation is indeed dangerous, but I am absolutely not pessimistic. As long as responsible comrades in all departments understand the shared relationship of success and failure, life and death, and everyone unites in will and works together, the situation can be turned from danger to safety, and the military can turn defeat into victory. In particular, the Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans must work together as a whole in the future, closely cooperating and coordinating under the overall national policy, so that the constitutional government can fulfill its function for the country and strengthen its ability to quell the rebellion and build the nation. The resolutions and opinions of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans must be earnestly adopted by the Executive Yuan. The Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, for all motions proposed and decided, must also consider the actual possibilities for the nation and the actual difficulties of the Executive Yuan. Only through such mutual assistance and cooperation can we complement each other. I hope everyone will share the difficulties, concentrate our efforts, and take concerted steps to complete our common mission of quelling the rebellion and building the nation.</p>

<h3>On the Importance of Hygiene Exhibitions</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongyi</p>
<p>Before we hope for a comfortable life, let us first ask ourselves if we have any healthy habits. Before we shout for national success, let us first ask ourselves if we have a healthy body. Because enjoying comfort relies on a healthy body, and building and prospering the nation relies even more on a healthy body. Without a healthy body, everything is in vain.</p>
<p>Strengthening the nation begins with strengthening the body. Citizens with first-class bodies can create a first-class nation. Now, if we want to join the ranks of the top five powers and demand international equality, our own bodies must first be equal to others, must first be strong. A comfortable life and national success rely on a high degree of culture: a golden age of culture must be preceded thirty years earlier by a golden age of health.</p>
<p>The cultural life of the entire Chinese nation is inherently highly variable. Why has the variability decreased since the Qin and Han dynasties? Why has it become even more uniform since the Five Dynasties, and why has creativity become increasingly narrow? Comparing Qin, Yu, Lu, and Jin a thousand years ago with today's Qin, Yu, Lu, and Jin, why is there such a vast difference in cultural creativity? How does Jiangxi from the Northern Song Dynasty to the early Ming Dynasty compare to today's Jiangxi? Why are Suzhou in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era and present-day Suzhou as different as two places? Aside from some common economic and political explanations, does it not at all raise the issue of the quality of talent?</p>
<p>Did our nation's ancestors who opened up the magnificent rivers and mountains not rely on strong bodies? Shennong and the Yellow Emperor personally tasted hundreds of herbs; they themselves were medical and hygiene experts. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, was himself a physician and absolutely advocated national conservation. In ancient times, our nation's emperors and sages were tall and long-lived. Tang was nine feet tall, King Wen was ten feet tall, and Confucius was nine feet six inches tall, each with a dignified and imposing appearance. The handsome men in the Book of Songs are Gongshuduan, and the beautiful women are Zhuang Jiang, both being large, strong, and beautiful. The Yellow Emperor himself lived to be 240 years old, and he said: "The upper lifespan of a person is 120, the middle lifespan is 100, and the lower lifespan is 80, otherwise all are premature deaths."</p>
<p>Ji Shuye in his Discourse on Nourishing Life, also said: "If guidance and nourishment are properly managed to fulfill one's nature and life, one can obtain over a thousand years at best, and several hundred years at worst, which is attainable." According to today's science, the lifespan of an organism is calculated by multiplying the years required for growth by seven. The age of growth is when our leg and arm bones meet, which is just 30 years old. Multiplying this by seven gives 210 years. However, our average lifespan is only 30 years, which is more than half that of civilized countries. Why is this? As Shuye said:</p>
<p>"The world does not observe, only sees grains, indulges in sights and sounds, eyes perceive black and yellow, ears seek lewd tunes, flavors sear their internal organs, sweet wines damage their stomach and intestines, fragrances rot their bones and marrow, joy and anger contradict their righteous qi, thoughts and worries consume their spirit, sorrow and happiness harm their plain essence. To drive such a frail body, those who alter it are wrong. Easy to exhaust is the body, and internally and externally it receives enemies. The body is not wood or stone, how can it enter? Those who indulge themselves to the extreme, do not regulate their diet, causing a hundred diseases; are not tired of lust, leading to exhaustion; are afflicted by wind and cold, and harmed by a hundred poisons, encountering these disasters."</p>
<p>In the Hong Fan chapter of the Book of Documents, what about the "Five Blessings": first, longevity; second, health and tranquility; third, wealth; fourth, love of virtue; and fifth, a good end. Which of these does not promote hygiene and health? Wealth and morality are products of health, and a good end means dying without illness, which is naturally an effect of hygiene. The Book of Documents is the highest theory of political philosophy in ancient times. Whether this book is true or false, these great principles have always been written in ancient times. Just take the Book of Rites, almost half of it discusses the way of hygiene, and it particularly emphasizes mental hygiene. Fetal care is discussed in great detail in the Baobao chapter of the Da Dai Li Ji. The I Ching pays close attention to children's nutrition. Confucius discussed the I Ching in the Zhouyi Xugua: "Things are born inevitably in ignorance, so they are followed by ignorance. Ignorance means young. Things that are young must be nourished, so they are followed by nourishment. Nourishment is the way of food and drink." Mencius taught us about safety education long ago: "A gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall." Confucius taught us the way to ride in a carriage: "When boarding a carriage, be sure to stand upright and hold the reins. Do not look back in the carriage, do not speak quickly, and do not point with the fingers." Many superstitions and seasons in our customs have deep meanings of health education. For example, weighing people on the Beginning of Summer embodies the meaning of a health check; the "Thanking the Kitchen God" on the 24th of the twelfth month contains the meaning of cleaning: originally it was for epidemic prevention, and also for public health. Such examples are countless, all of which are sufficient to prove that hygiene is the foundation of the nation.</p>
<p>In the second twenty years of the nineteenth century, English and French manufacturers mixed two different types of glass together, resulting in the birth of the modern complex microscope. As a result, Pasteur discovered the phenomenon of fermentation, and then learned the cause of silkworm disease, finally proving that disease is transmitted by bacteria. Hygiene ushered in a great revolution. In 1876, the German doctor Koch announced the life history of Bacillus anthracis, and six years later discovered the transmission of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In 1796, the English doctor Jenner invented vaccination. In 1873, the American doctor Trudeau defeated tuberculosis with a healthy lifestyle. Since then, hygiene and hygiene organizations have become important, and public health has made great progress. Disease and mortality rates have sharply reduced. Before the war, public health in various countries still focused on controlling diseases. Today, however, the style has greatly changed, with great effort being put into prevention work, while also paying attention to medical treatment. Among the prevention work, health education is the most effective undertaking. Our hygiene exhibition in Shanghai this time is an important part of public health education. It is hoped that this exhibition will be suitable for the national conditions, be able to concisely and systematically cultivate citizens' hygiene habits, instill hygiene appreciation, and create a hygiene concept, so that everyone recognizes that unhygienic is shameful, is barbaric; this is related to life, related to national destiny, and related to the happiness of all mankind. At the same time, it is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will receive this baptism of hygiene and spread it to the whole country.</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Wang Returns to the Capital, Reports to the President and Premier Weng Today on His Trip to the United States, Will Formulate a Plan to Guide Floating Capital</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu returned to Nanjing at 8:40 PM on the 11th. He will meet with the President and Premier Weng on the 12th. At the station, Wang told reporters that his trip to the United States to attend two international financial conferences went very well. The greatest achievement of the meetings was the confirmation in principle of two important points: (1) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has focused on reconstruction work in the past, but will pay equal attention to development in the future. (2) In the past, more attention was paid to Europe, but the Far East and South America will be given equal attention in the future. All countries attending the conference unanimously agreed to the above two principles, and the technical details of implementation will be the responsibility of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will consist of 14 members, including five ex officio members appointed by representatives from China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and India, and nine other members already selected by the member states. Regarding the issue of China's payment of its share of the International Monetary Fund, Wang said that it has not yet been paid because the foreign exchange rate after China's currency reform has not yet been determined. According to regulations, the amount of shares China should pay should be one-tenth of the foreign exchange held by China when it joined the International Monetary Fund. At that time, China had more than US$500 million in foreign exchange, so China should pay more than US$50 million in shares. China's exchange rate will be proposed at an appropriate time, and whether to pay the shares first or propose the exchange rate first will be decided freely by China. Wang also said that when he met with the finance ministers of the United States and the United Kingdom during the conference, they all believed that China's currency reform was a timely move, and they all believed that the situation after China's currency reform was very good, and they believed that currency reform was the beginning of China's implementation of a self-help plan. When reporters asked him what new hopes he brought back this time and whether he had raised the issue of loans with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Wang said that he did not go for loans this time, and loans could only be requested after the Executive Committee was established and the shares were paid. When Wang arrived in Nanjing, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, Li Tang, and responsible persons at all levels went to the station to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Finance Wang Yun arrived in Shanghai from the United States at 10:15 PM on the 10th. According to his remarks: Regarding the issue of foreign aid, I believe that it can go hand in hand with self-help. At this stage, military aid to China is particularly important, so when I was in Washington, I publicly declared that China needs US$500 million in military aid each year. There are also many people in the United States who agree with this view. When reporters discussed the issue of currency issuance with Wang, the Minister of Finance said that his hasty return was mainly to deal with floating capital. Although the current issuance is close to one billion, two-thirds of it is in urgent need of circulation. In the future, a plan will be formulated for overall management. Regarding the Legislative Yuan,</p>

<h3>Unfortunate Incident on National Day; Three American Soldiers Beat Elementary School Students with Sticks</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Elementary School Students Injured</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] An unfortunate incident occurred in the capital on National Day in which American soldiers beat elementary school students with sticks, injuring more than ten people. After mediation by all parties, the matter is expected to be resolved smoothly. On the morning of the 10th, the boy scouts of the Xinsheng Elementary School (on Linsen Road), which is run by the Catholic Church, were gathering to participate in the civil servants' sports meet when they were attacked by several American soldiers who seized their wooden sticks and beat them randomly, injuring more than ten students including Wang Baoxun, Liu Jiazheng, Sun Ziwen, and Hu Wei. Tu Jing, the son of Legislative Yuan member Xu Gongshui, was also among them. Subsequently, American military police arrived in a car and took the three American soldiers away. The American soldiers involved in the incident were related to the Sacred Heart Church of the Jesuit Society. Father Hao of the church, after being persuaded by the director of the East District Police Department, has apologized to Xu Zheren, the principal of Xinsheng Elementary School, and promised to compensate the injured students for their medical expenses. According to Principal Xu, Father Hao did come to the school and said, "If it is our fault, I apologize to you," but the matter of compensating for medical expenses has not yet been realized.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Gives Concrete Answers to Various Issues Raised in the Petition of the Money Industry; The Determined Minimum Capital Amount Will Not Be Changed</h3>
<p>[Three newspapers, Nanjing, 11th] Zhu Yuan, Assistant Officer of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, upon the order of Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, met with Qin Runqing, Shen Rixin, Wang Yizhai, and other representatives of the National Money Industry Petition Group, who requested the government to relax the capital amount and deadline for increasing the capital of banks. (A) Regarding the increase in capital, it can be divided into four points: (1) The minimum capital amount will remain unchanged in accordance with the "Regulations on Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks." (2) The deadline for increasing capital will remain at two months, but will be calculated in accordance with the "Regulations on the Effective Date of Laws." (3) The provision that the cash portion of the increased capital must be deposited in the Central Bank for three months will remain unchanged. If various banks have legitimate uses in the future and request to use the funds, the applicable method for using them will be followed. For those whose cash increase exceeds 50%, the Ministry of Finance will approve the use of the excess on a case-by-case basis. The funds deposited in the Central Bank will be paid interest by analogy with the deposit reserve. For places where there is no Central Bank, the Ministry will negotiate with the Central Bank separately. (4) Regarding the asset appreciation portion, for assets purchased after the 27th year, the original calculation formula stipulated that the national wholesale price index for June of the 37th year should be used. Now, with reference to item C of the fourth clause of the Supplementary Measures for Financial Consolidation, it has been changed to calculate up to the first half of August of the 37th year, that is, when assets appreciate, it will be allowed to calculate according to the price index in the first half of August of the 37th year. The original request to allow shareholders to use assets other than cash to offset the payment of shares is not approved. (B) Regarding the exchange margin portion, the exchange margin will still be paid according to the regulations of the Central Bank, but during the capital adjustment period, it may be deducted from the amount of cash deposited in the Central Bank for the increase in capital. However, after the three-month period for the cash increase deposited in the Central Bank expires, the exchange margin portion will not be returned. (C) Regarding the interest rate portion, a temporary reply will be given. After receiving the reply from the Ministry of Finance, the representatives of the Money Industry Association proposed that the situation in the pacification area and the areas close to the bandit areas was special, and requested a flexible approach. Assistant Zhu promised to convey this.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] After receiving the reply from the Ministry of Finance, the representatives of the National Money Industry Association left Beijing in batches. Qin Runqing and Shen Rixin left for Shanghai by car on the afternoon of the 11th.</p>
<h3>Peiping Prison Has No Food for Prisoners; Sixty Prisoners Released on Bail</h3>

<h3>Meat Vendors in the Capital Punished for Raising Prices</h3>

<h3>Prices Fall in Peiping and Chengdu</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 11th] Prices in Peiping have been falling yesterday and today, with gradually increasing supply and panic buying gradually becoming a thing of the past. Only a very small number of grain stores still have to sell a small amount of stock at the limit price daily, due to the competition for purchases by special elements, which has repeatedly created dangerous situations. With the understanding of the authorities, merchants can make a fortune again, but it is only the few public utilities and small civil servants such as the trolley company who are suffering, as they are not allowed to raise prices and cannot create a black market, while the latter have used up the whole month's expenses in ten days.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Chengdu, 11th] Prices in Chengdu began to fall on the 11th due to the permission to release materials transported from Shanghai. Cloth and department stores fell, while grain prices remained stable. The Chengdu Youth Army specially organized a meeting to support the new economic policy, mobilizing the people to fight against unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province's Purchase of Hong Kong Exchange Case; The Guangzhou National Assembly Representatives Association Passes a Resolution; Sends a Telegram to the President Requesting a Thorough Investigation, Saying the Amount and Whether It Is Illegal Are in Doubt</h3>

Chen also attended the meeting. As a result, an amendment was passed on the spot to telegram the President, the original text of which is roughly as follows: According to reports, the province's bank actually withdrew 5 trillion yuan from the Central Bank on that day.

Please send personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth to dispel doubts.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Remarks</h3>
<p>Said That He Has Telegraphed the Central Government Again to Send an Investigation Team</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th] Regarding the rumors that Chairman Song Ziwen of Guangdong Province used his position to purchase Hong Kong dollars for personal gain on the eve of the currency reform, this reporter specifically visited Song today and received the following statement: When I went to Beijing in early August, I obtained a loan of 5 trillion legal currency from the Central Bank for Guangdong Province, worth about 1.6 million gold yuan, which was specifically for purchasing rice for distribution needed by the province. On that day, I also obtained 20,000 tons from the 100,000 tons of Siamese rice purchased by the Ministry of Food to allocate to various provinces. However, Minister Guan specifically stated on that day that the Central Bank would not be able to provide foreign exchange for the purchase of the above Siamese rice, so the Guangdong Provincial Government should find its own foreign exchange funds. Moreover, the batch of Siamese rice should be purchased before the end of October. All of these matters were specifically instructed in a telegram from the Ministry of Food afterward. When I returned to Guangzhou from Beijing on August 16th, the Guangdong Provincial Bank had already started using part of the Central Bank's loan on behalf of the Guangdong Rice Procurement Committee to purchase foreign exchange to pay for the Siamese rice purchase. Until August 19th, when the Central Government suddenly announced the currency reform, the province's bank had only purchased a total of 592,335 Hong Kong dollars in foreign exchange in Hong Kong. The province's bank also stopped purchasing Hong Kong dollars from that day on. Afterward, rumors spread, saying that people in the provincial government had used the provincial bank to purchase Hong Kong dollars for personal gain. I immediately telegraphed the actual situation to Premier Weng and requested a thorough investigation. I then received a reply from Premier Weng saying: "It is not inappropriate to seek public benefit with public funds. The Executive Yuan fully understands the nature of this purchase of Hong Kong dollars, so it believes that a thorough investigation is not necessary." Previously, at the press conference on the first anniversary of my inauguration on the 2nd of this month, the General Manager of the Provincial Bank also reported the process of purchasing Hong Kong dollars orally and in writing. Although this matter has been explained and clarified above, there are still many rumors, making me embarrassed. Therefore, I have telegraphed the Central Government again, requesting them to send fair investigators to Guangdong to investigate. If it is found that any civil servant has used their position to seek personal gain, they should be severely punished. However, if it is found that the allegations are unfounded, those responsible for the accusations should also be severely punished as a warning.</p>

<h3>Material Supply Bureau Responds to Criticism of Handling U.S. Surplus Materials: Western Newspaper Comments are Inconsistent with Facts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] In response to recent commentaries in Western newspapers regarding the government's handling of U.S. surplus materials, the Material Supply Bureau provides the following clarification based on facts:</p>
<p>"Recently, Western newspapers in Shanghai have repeatedly criticized our country's handling of U.S. surplus materials. These comments, arising from inaccurate reporting, are inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>Regarding the achievements of our government's surplus material handling organization, the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau has successively shipped approximately one million tons of equipment back to the country from Pacific islands, or has already sold it on the islands. All island operations are expected to be completed within a few months. Of the materials already shipped to Shanghai, 450,000 tons have been processed to date, approximately half of the total received. The handling of other items such as landing craft, small ships, communication equipment, and food has also reached the expected rate. The remaining few materials that have not yet been processed are being actively sorted, transported, and sold.</p>
<p>Considering the actual situation of the above-mentioned handling, we express regret that the above-mentioned Western newspapers have made hasty comments without investigating the truth and relying solely on inaccurate reports. Some comments state that our government has neglected the storage of surplus materials, allowing them to be exposed outdoors, corroded, and rusted, and that such losses could have been avoided if warehouses had been built. All of this is a disregard of the actual situation. All materials that should be stored in warehouses have been properly handled by us. Those stored in the open air are mostly large, bulky, and non-perishable machinery and equipment, or there are cases where the quantity of materials is enormous, the exchange time is short, and it is necessary to use open spaces. Even the U.S. agencies holding the materials, despite having perfect technical equipment and ample space on the islands to build huge warehouses, still piled up equipment in the open air. For this reason, the 'rusted and corroded' materials seen by foreign reporters had already been rusted long before they were transferred and sold to our country, because they had been left on the beaches of various islands for two years, buried in mud and eroded by wind and rain. Now it is said that these perfect materials became waste after being delivered to our country, which is absurd.</p>
<p>In most people's minds, surplus materials, even if new, should at least be in usable condition. In fact, the materials sold to us by the U.S. were far less impressive than imagined. When we signed the contract, we hoped to obtain usable or salable items, but after receiving them, we realized that we had only obtained mostly waste. In particular, the materials declared as surplus by the U.S. holding agencies in recent months are all poorly stored, exposed for a long time, or stolen and dismantled waste products. For example, the Shanghai office of the U.S. law firm hired by the Material Supply Bureau recently sent people to investigate Okinawa Island. Their report stated: 'Hundreds of motor vehicles have no engines or wheels, and important parts of cranes, tractors, and road graders have been dismantled.' These wastes are still declared as complete locomotives and construction equipment, and transferred to our side. From this, it can be seen that the damaged surplus materials are obviously not the responsibility of our government and handling agencies. They cannot understand the difficulty of our country in handling these materials and rashly criticize us for failing to fulfill our responsibility for storage, which is unfair."</p>

<h3>Berlin Blockade Lifted, Foreign Ministers' Conference Reconvened: Three Powers Insist on Basic Principles, Neutral Countries' Mediation Still Underway, Britain Releases White Paper Accusing Soviet Union of Actions in Berlin</h3>
<p>[News Report] Paris, November 11 (Broadcast): A U.S. spokesperson stated that the United States has never considered abandoning the principle of simultaneously lifting the Berlin blockade and convening a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, he continued, the United States has not taken any position that would preclude such a resolution. This does not necessarily mean that the U.S. supports or intends to support the principle of simultaneous actions. The spokesperson stated, "The three powers are united in their views regarding the position and approach to the Berlin crisis. Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, who is attempting to mediate the dispute between East and West on the Berlin issue, plans to meet with Vyshinsky again, hoping to obtain the Soviet Union's response to the compromise proposal."</p>
<p>[News Report] Paris, November 11 (Broadcast): British and American spokespersons stated that the notes from Britain and France to the Argentine Foreign Minister reiterate the basic principles of the Western powers' hope that the Security Council will resolve the Berlin stalemate. The notes clearly indicate that the Western powers are not prepared to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue, as the Kremlin wishes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, November 11] A Western spokesperson stated on the 11th that the three Western countries have hardened their position on the Berlin crisis and insist that the Soviet Union must first lift the Berlin blockade before they are willing to negotiate with it on the German issue. Previously, it was reported that the West was prepared to accept a compromise plan, lifting the Berlin blockade on one hand and convening a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German peace treaty on the other. The West has announced its new developments while the United Nations is hesitating to act on the Berlin issue. Informed sources said that the Security Council has extended its meeting until the middle or end of this week to await a response from Soviet Representative Vyshinsky to the compromise proposal. The West's new actions appear to have nullified the compromise proposal put forward by U.S. Representative Jessup in the Security Council last Wednesday. Jessup concluded: "When the blockade is lifted, the United States will immediately attend a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss any issues related to Germany with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>[News Report] London, November 11 (Broadcast): The British government released a 40,000-word White Paper on the 11th, reporting on the negotiations of the Berlin crisis and stating the British government's position. The statement accuses the Soviet Union of attempting to drive the Western powers out of Berlin, imprisoning thousands of Germans in concentration camps, and attempting to undermine Europe's economic recovery. The statement is largely the same as the one issued by the United Kingdom on September 27, but is more detailed. The main points are as follows: (1) The Soviet government has no intention of reaching an agreement except on its own terms. (2) The Soviet authorities in Berlin are condoning a small group's attempt to overthrow the legitimate Berlin city government. (3) The Soviet Union is attempting to force the Western occupying powers to abandon their rights in Berlin under pressure. (4) Accepting the Soviet Union's terms would be tantamount to immediately incorporating the Western occupation zones of Berlin into the Soviet economic system, stripping the Western occupying powers of their rights and obligations, and placing the entire city of Berlin under Soviet control.</p>
<h3>Marshall Flies Back to Paris, President Truman Accepts Secretary Marshall's Advice, Announces Cancellation of Plan to Send Special Envoy to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[News Report] Washington, November 11 (Broadcast): Marshall flew back to Paris on the 11th to attend the United Nations General Assembly, hoping to mend the rift in Western unity caused by Truman's plan to send a special envoy to Moscow. Truman is scheduled to fly from the National Airport at 1:00 PM on the 11th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, November 10] U.S. Representative to the United Nations Jessup met with British Representative Cadogan and French Representative Parodi on the 10th. American representatives in Paris are still extremely concerned about Truman's consideration of sending Justice Vinson to the Soviet Union. They are eager for Marshall to return to Paris to assure Western European countries that the United States is no longer considering actions outside the scope of the Security Council. The general mood indicates that there will be a nervous attitude toward possible actions by the United States until after the U.S. election.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, November 10] President Truman revealed after an emergency meeting with Secretary of State Marshall on the 9th that he had abandoned his plan to send a peace envoy to Moscow. Truman stated that he proposed sending Justice Vinson to the Kremlin because "I still have a great desire to establish peace in the world, and I am particularly concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the atomic energy issue." He asked Marshall whether it would be useful to send Vinson on a peace mission "to make the Soviet leaders understand the seriousness and sincerity of the American people's feelings about this matter." Truman stated, "Secretary of State Marshall has described in detail to me the situation he faces in Paris. Due to his report and the possibility that any unilateral action, no matter how good, may be misunderstood at present, it has been decided not to take this step." Marshall later told a press conference, "If the Berlin blockade can be lifted first, we are very willing to hold a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the Berlin issue and the German issue." Marshall continued that he had discussed with the President the "danger of misunderstanding" among Western countries if the United States took any unilateral action to resolve the Berlin issue. This danger is currently most important because it could hinder the "strong cooperation" and "absolute unity" that Western countries currently maintain in Paris. Asked if the President fully supported his position, Marshall replied, "Full support." Marshall revealed that the plan to send Vinson to the Soviet Union had been abandoned during the transatlantic conversation between Truman and Marshall on the 5th. He further stated that he believed that the international control of atomic energy plan would not be established unless the Soviet Union had a desire for peace.</p>
<h3>Southern Country Representative Supports Soviet Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, November 11] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj, who was purged by the Cominform together with Marshal Tito, warned Western countries on the 11th that they should not try to defend the Southern country "from Soviet control." This is the first time that the Cominform infighting has been raised in the UN General Assembly. Kardelj firmly defended Soviet foreign policy, praising it as a policy of peace, and denouncing Western foreign policy as aggressive, aimed at dominating the world.</p>
<h3>Increase in Ground Strength Obtained Through U.S. Equipment</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, November 10] Recent large-scale exercises by the Turkish army have ended and were reviewed by President Inönü today, with the participation of the U.S. military delegation and foreign military committees. Observers here say that the exercises prove that the Turkish army has made great progress after obtaining equipment from the United States.</p>
<h3>Political Committee Debates Disarmament Issue, Our Representative Clarifies Stance: Any Plan Difficult to Accept Without Guaranteed Security</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, November 11] At this morning's meeting of the UN General Assembly Political Committee, Chinese Representative Chiang Ting-fu expressed his views on the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal, stating that the Chinese delegation does not believe that a plan that deviates from the spirit of the Charter can effectively enhance peace and security. He continued, "I would like to solemnly point out that any disarmament plan will not succeed unless an international army is established at the same time." He also stated that the work of the Committee on Conventional Armaments would have made more progress if the Soviet Union had not resolutely obstructed the work plan of the Committee at every stage of the discussion. Chiang Ting-fu then cited domestic events in China as an example, stating that before the end of this war, the Chinese government, despite the obvious threat from the Chinese Communists, tried to maintain domestic unity and implemented disarmament immediately after the end of the war. After the victory over Japan, the government immediately demobilized, intending to reduce wartime forces by one-fifth. Without the Communist rebellion, China would have been able to allocate a portion of its manpower and financial resources to rebuild its war-torn economy. Chiang concluded that China's armed forces are not related to aggression against any country and are used solely for domestic security. However, any disarmament plan is difficult to accept without proper consideration of domestic security conditions. The debate on disarmament will continue this afternoon.</p>
<h3>North Korea Requests UN General Assembly Permission to Attend Meetings</h3>
<p>North Korean Police Shoot U.S. Soldiers</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, November 11] According to Pyongyang Radio: Pak Hon-yong, Chairman of the North Korean People's Assembly, has submitted a request to the Chairman of the UN General Assembly to send official representatives to attend and participate in the discussions at the UN General Assembly when the Korean issue is discussed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, November 11] The U.S. military here announced that an incident occurred on the 9th in Kaesong, 45 miles from the 38th parallel boundary, in which four members of the North Korean police force shot at U.S. military personnel.</p>
<h3>British Commonwealth Conference Opens: Dominions to Express Views on Western European Union, Nehru Advocates Forming Southeast Asian Federation</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, November 11] The British Commonwealth Conference, chaired by British Prime Minister Attlee, opened at 11:30 AM on the 11th at No. 10 Downing Street. The first item was to welcome the arrival of the Commonwealth politicians in London. Attlee said: Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King could not attend and expressed "deep regret." He emphasized that the participants are "equal" in status and especially welcomed the Prime Ministers of the three Asian countries "that have become independent countries within the Commonwealth since 1946" - Nehru of India, Ali Khan of Pakistan, and Senanayake of Ceylon. The conference will hold a closed-door meeting in the afternoon, where British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will explain the long-term impact of the European Recovery Program on the development of the Commonwealth in the eyes of the British government. Officials from the Commonwealth Relations Office said: Although the Dominions do not oppose the Marshall Plan and the Western European Union, their representatives have been instructed by their respective governments to request certain guarantees on economic and defense plans, so "there will undoubtedly be very frank remarks during the meeting", but military issues will not be discussed. British Defense Minister Alexander, Air Force Marshal Tedder, and War Minister Shinwell all attended to welcome the dignitaries from the Dominions. It is generally recognized that the attendance of former Chancellor Dalton at the conference is very important, as Dalton has always advocated organizing an African alliance in imitation of the Western European Union to block loopholes in the anti-Soviet Union front. It is reported that Cripps will explain that it is a mistake to think that Britain must choose one between Western Europe and the Commonwealth and abandon the other. The British government argues that the Commonwealth needs the Western European Union, because if Britain is isolated, it will become a burden on the Dominions. The organization of the Western European Union joint defense group itself is not a new plan, but part of the original plan for regional groups set by the United Nations. Each member of the Commonwealth must take a share of the responsibility. The British government has stated that there is currently a general plan for Commonwealth defense. At the same time, London officials said: It is a mistake to speculate that Nehru intends to announce that the Indian government is preparing to withdraw from the Commonwealth. Nehru will declare to the conference that India and Ceylon require the establishment of independent republics, and their mission is to study whether this constitutional difference can be applied to the Commonwealth. Nehru will also propose "organizing a Southeast Asian Federation" as a group in the world's economic and strategic integration. Personnel from the Commonwealth Relations Office said that the position of South Africa is also the same, as it is still unclear whether the new Prime Minister Malan intends to remain a Dominion and maintain Commonwealth relations.</p>
<h3>New Cuban President Inaugurated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, November 10] New Cuban President Zayas took the oath of office today. He succeeds Martín as President. After winning the election in May, Zayas told reporters that he was determined to eliminate the Communist forces in the labor world.</p>
<h3>Frog Heart Transplant Experiment Successful</h3>
<p>New Achievements by Soviet Professor Sinitzin</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, November 10, United Press] Moscow Radio reported that Soviet professor Sinitzin has succeeded in experiments on transplanting hearts between cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals at the Gorky Medical Research Institute. According to the broadcast, Professor Sinitzin's new book "Heart Transplantation" states that he transplanted the heart of a frog into another frog, and another heart was placed in the recipient frog's body. Both frogs are currently unharmed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Threatens Berlin Airlift, Continues Air Combat Exercises, Disregarding Repeated Protests from the West</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, November 11] The Soviet Union announced on the 11th that it would repeat air combat exercises near Berlin, and its dive bombers will practice in the Hamburg-Berlin air corridor that British air transport groups must pass through. The Soviet announcement has been posted at the Four-Power Aviation Safety Center. The announcement also stated that Soviet aircraft will practice firing at the ground in addition to air combat. U.S. officials said that they do not plan to file a protest, as the Soviet Union has been constantly practicing since last week, and the U.S. has made repeated protests without reply.</p>
<h3>French Strike Wave Ordered by Cominform</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, November 11] French Interior Minister Moch told a meeting of the Socialist Party on the evening of the 10th that the strike of 350,000 miners, which has entered its second week, is a plan of the Cominform. As Moch's words were still echoing, the General Confederation of Labor, commanded by the Communist Party, held its annual meeting in the strike wave on the 11th. Moch said, "A few days before Zhdanov's death, an order was issued instructing the General Confederation of Labor to start action in September. A few days later, the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor replied to the Cominform that everything was ready and that they were only waiting to launch at the end of September. The French Communist Party was ordered to cause a straight line decline in production while the UN General Assembly was in session, creating a situation similar to the Prague coup in February."</p>
<h3>Chaotic Political Situation, Heavy Atmosphere in the Country: Special Japanese Diet Opens, Scheduled to Vote for New Prime Minister Today</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, November 11] The Third Extraordinary Diet of Japan, as scheduled, convened on the 11th, and due to the confusion of the political situation and the relationship with the Showa Denko Incident, the atmosphere in the Diet inevitably feels heavy. On the side of the House of Representatives, the attendance of members was not very enthusiastic, and only 20 people attended by 9:30 AM, and most of them were members of the Democratic Liberal Party who sang "Our Party Dominates the World." Only three members of the Socialist Party attended. At 10:30 AM, the bell rang to open the House of Councilors, and it adjourned after only designating seats. The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 11:50 AM, and groups of people could be seen gathering and talking in secret everywhere in the corridor. The session was closed immediately after it opened.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, November 11] The agenda and session period of the Japanese Extraordinary Diet are still temporarily set at 30 days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, November 11] Shigeru Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party plans to form a new cabinet on the 11th, but it is not yet known whether the new cabinet will be another coalition government, or whether the party will form a one-party government, setting a precedent since the Japanese surrender. The Democratic Liberal Party has formally requested the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives to vote for a new Prime Minister at the special session of the Diet on the 12th. Party leaders are busy dealing with various parties to gain their cooperation. However, well-informed sources expressed doubt as to whether the election would be held on the 12th. They said: Shigeru Yoshida is trying to win the support of the three main political parties, including the Democratic Party of former Prime Minister Ashida, the Socialist Party of Tetsu Katayama, and the Cooperative Party. However, the three parties have already reached a general agreement that the Democratic Liberal Party must announce the general policy of the new cabinet before the Diet votes for a new Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>Dewey's Campaign Speech Advocates Strengthening Aid to China</h3>
<p>What Actions Will Be Taken Is Not Explained</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, November 10] U.S. Republican presidential candidate Dewey, recently in a campaign across the United States, advocated increasing U.S. aid to China, but has not yet indicated what concrete plans the Republican government will have in Washington in January. In four important speeches, Dewey expressed deep dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s limited aid policy toward China, and demanded that the U.S. provide full economic and military aid to make China a bastion against world communism in Asia. Dewey has repeatedly criticized the current aid to China as being too small and insufficient, and is very dissatisfied with the U.S.'s "cold" treatment of friendly countries and allies. Dewey said that if he is elected president, he will remedy this situation, but he did not explain what actions he will take.</p>

<h3>United States Utilizing Waste to Research Straw Pulp Manufacturing</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The American agricultural and chemical industries in Illinois are currently researching the manufacturing of white paper using straw. It is generally believed that the success of this research has great economic importance, as the United States currently has 40 million tons of straw each year that is left to rot in the sun and rain, and it could transform huge amounts of waste into useful materials.</p>
<h3>U.S. Commander-in-Chief of Alaska Holds Secret Meeting with MacArthur</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] The U.S. Commander-in-Chief of the Alaska Defense Command, Lieutenant General Deininger, held a secret meeting with General MacArthur on the 11th. This is the first in a series of high-level meetings to coordinate the U.S. northern Pacific and Far East strategies. High-ranking military officers are unwilling to hint at the focus of the discussions at this meeting. Lieutenant General Deininger arrived here on the 10th with his staff. He will also meet with Lieutenant General Whitehead, commander of the U.S. Far East Air Forces, and Major General Wright, Chief of Staff of MacArthur's Far East Command. The troops led by MacArthur and Deininger are located on the shortest route to intercept the Soviet Union to the United States. The United States, through the joint defense of Alaska, Japan, and Okinawa, can sweep the sea and air routes between eastern Siberia and the American west coast, and can threaten bases launching attacks on the Pacific.</p>

<h3>Promoting Productivity While Maintaining Price Limits - Important Speech by Spokesperson of the Supervisory Office - Mutual Adjustment and Supply of Materials within the Circulation Area - Manufacturers Should Supply Goods to the Market as Much as Possible - Distribution of Daily Necessities for Public Servants and Teachers Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A spokesperson for the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisory Office received reporters at 6:00 PM on the 10th and made the following statement:</p>
<p>(1) In order to implement comprehensive economic controls, the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisory Office has sent letters to all provinces and cities to abolish all local measures prohibiting the export of goods, so that materials in this area can circulate as much as possible and adjust to each other, so as to avoid the phenomenon of each acting on its own. Shanghai will give priority to supplying manufactured products to the provinces and cities under its jurisdiction, and the provinces and cities under its jurisdiction will also supply Shanghai with raw materials as much as possible. The quantity of daily necessities required by each province and city should be listed by the local trade associations and reported to the Supervisory Office for overall planning and reasonable allocation. The prices in various places should be based on Shanghai's "August 19th" price limit. If there are unreasonable prices, they can be adjusted appropriately according to local conditions. (2) The first phase of the general registration and inspection of essential goods in Shanghai has been completed. The measures for the export of goods have also been promulgated. All daily necessities needed in various places, such as yarn, cloth, sugar, soap, tobacco, and paper, can be ordered from the relevant trade associations in Shanghai, and transported out of the country after approval by the Economic Supervisory Office. However, in order to avoid raising prices, merchants, whether near or far, shall not freely compete to purchase in Shanghai. Except for materials legally allowed to be exported, no goods shall be smuggled. The inspection work at each transportation station has been strengthened to prevent leakage.</p>
<p>Assisting Factories in Purchasing Raw Materials</p>
<p>(3) The Supervisory Office attaches great importance to the production of each factory. The government has specific measures for the domestic and foreign raw materials needed by each factory, and will assist in purchasing them as much as possible, so as not to reduce factory production, and guarantee its legal profits. This measure will be planned and implemented within this week. (4) The manufacturers of daily necessities registered in this general registration should supply the market as much as possible. If it is found that there are goods in short supply on the market that are hoarded and not sold, they should be punished as hoarding. The name and quantity of products manufactured by each factory should be registered with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and wholesale them as much as possible, and must not be hidden, otherwise they will also be punished as hoarding.</p>
<p>Strictly Investigate and Punish Black Market Transactions</p>
<p>(5) The work of price control in Shanghai had initially achieved success, but since last week, there have been villains stirring up trouble, spreading rumors to undermine the credit of the gold yuan, and even some people have used large amounts of funds to purchase materials, disrupting people's minds and causing instability in the market. The Supervisory Office firmly stated that this phenomenon will never be allowed to exist, and the "August 19th" price limit policy will continue to be strictly enforced, and special efforts will be made to eliminate the black market. In the future, anyone found to be engaged in black market transactions of gold, silver, and foreign currency shall be immediately sent to the local Special Criminal Court, and shall be severely punished in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Gold and Foreign Currency Transactions, in addition to confiscating the gold, silver, and foreign currency. The informant will receive 40% of the total amount as a reward after the case is solved. Anyone engaged in black market transactions of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rice, flour, sugar, oil, and other daily necessities and other industrial raw materials, in addition to confiscating all their goods, shall be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. If the circumstances are serious and it is found that there is suspicion of disrupting finance, they will also be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for strict handling. The informant of the above-mentioned black market for daily necessities and industrial raw materials will receive 40% of the total value of the goods as a reward after the case is solved.</p>
<p>A Small Amount of Wool Yarn Will Be Rationed Appropriately</p>
<p>(6) Goods such as wool, cloth, cotton yarn, and edible oil should be purchased according to the quantity stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, with an identity card or household registration card, and must not be destroyed. No store shall raise prices under any pretext. From November 1st, workers, students, and public servants and teachers will be rationed daily necessities in accordance with the "August 19th" price limit. The price of wool yarn will not be adjusted for the time being, but it has been found that the stock of wool yarn in the city is not abundant, and it has been decided to distribute it to schools and cooperative societies of various agencies first, and priority should be given to elementary school students. Detailed measures are being drafted. (7) The amount of cotton yarn allocated to the cotton yarn re-weaving industry has been increased to 30,000 pieces this month to maintain production. (8) The source of wheat for each flour mill in this city is scarce, and the Central Farmers Bank is now assisting each factory to purchase in large quantities. If the supply of flour required in this city is insufficient, it will be supplied by the Central Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>Confiscated Materials Begin to Be Sold</p>
<p>(9) Since the start of the inspection work, all confiscated materials will be sold in succession starting this week. Most of the proceeds from the sale will be allocated to the local government for the purpose of relieving refugees and rewarding poor students. (10) Recently, there have been villains spreading rumors on the market to undermine the credit of the gold yuan. In addition to strictly ordering the military police to investigate at any time, it is hoped that all citizens will not be deceived by them, and will unanimously assist the government so that social life can be stabilized.</p>

<h3>Residents Who Have Not Received Household Registration Plates Can Purchase Oil with Their Identity Cards</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously stipulated that citizens must purchase edible oil with a household registration card, limited to one catty per person per month, in order to prevent edible oil from being purchased for hoarding and smuggling. However, because some residents have not yet received household registration cards, it is inevitable that difficulties will arise when purchasing oil. In view of this, the Social Affairs Bureau has made appropriate changes to the oil purchase method. Those who have not received a household registration card may purchase edible oil with their national identity card, and the oil dealer will stamp it for record. The limited purchase quantity is still one catty per person per month. However, those who have already purchased oil with a household registration card this month must not purchase it with a national identity card again. The oil store shall check and register at any time during the sale to prevent malpractice. The Social Affairs Bureau has issued a notice to the Oil, Sauce Garden, and Sauce Wine Trade Association to instruct all edible oil retail stores to implement it from today.</p>

<h3>Special Tribunal Indicts 182 Defendants for Endangering National Security; Allegedly Conspired with Bandit Leader Ding Xishan's Forces to Disrupt Order</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Special Criminal Tribunal yesterday indicted 182 defendants in a national security case, marking a new record for the number of defendants in a single case before the court. The defendants, including Wang Zhongyi and others, are all related to the bandit leader Ding Xishan, who has already been killed. The composition of the 182 individuals is extremely complex, with the majority being workers from companies and factories such as the British and French Power Companies, the Shanghai Telephone Company, China Textiles, China Silk, Eizhong Tobacco Company, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, Mayar Silk Factory, Pathé Company, Tiangong Chemical Factory, and Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory. In addition, there are Wang Zhongyi, the owner of Gongji Xincheng Tobacco Paper Shop, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhu Pinliang, Fang Shenghong, the director of the record department at Pathé Company, Zhou Hongyuan, the chairman of the Zhanghua Factory Trade Union, and Tao Yunshan, the chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union. Among them, 31 are women.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, "The defendant Wang Zhongyi participated in a Communist bandit organization, went into hiding in Shanghai, and attempted to collaborate with the bandit forces to disrupt order, with the aim of undermining the national system and overthrowing the government. After Ding Xishan led his troops to raid Jiangnan in March of this year and was surrounded and killed, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department persuaded Hong Guankang, a key figure who escaped the encirclement, to surrender and allowed him to atone for his crimes.</p>
<p>Roundup in One Sweep</p>
<p>Through Hong's investigation, it was discovered that the defendant Wang Zhongyi was the person who introduced the bandit leader Ding to the Communist underground in Shanghai. His address was initially unknown, but then they encountered the defendant Wei Zhongmou, who was also a cadre of Ding's forces and had a kinship with Wang. Wei was deceived into believing that after Ding's death, the connection had been severed, and Wei was asked to seek contact with Wang. The bureau then devised a plan to have Wei lead undercover officers to Wang's Gongji Xincheng Tobacco Paper Shop, where they found a list of Communist bandits on the upper floor. Personnel were dispatched to track them down, and Zhou Yunlong and 130 other defendants were arrested. The other 54 defendants, including Tao Yunshan, fled out of fear of punishment after the case was exposed and later surrendered themselves. The bureau transferred them to the court for interrogation. Except for Xu Rongren, who died, and Zhuang Jianan, whose crimes were deemed insufficient for prosecution, the Special Criminal Tribunal, after investigation, determined that the evidence against the 182 defendants was conclusive. Wang Zhongyi was charged with violating Article 2, Section 3 of the Emergency Decree for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Security During the Suppression of Rebellion, and the remaining 181 defendants, including Zhou Yunlong, were charged with violating Article 3 of the same decree. Public prosecution was initiated in accordance with Article 8, Section 1 of the same decree, Article 2 of the Special Criminal Tribunal Trial Regulations, and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>

<h3>Gao Keng Mine Situation</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 6th by Air] Coal mines in Pingxiang have a history of more than 40 years, but a "gulf" exists between the coal mines and the people of Pingxiang, which has not yet been eliminated. There are still many unnecessary difficulties imposed on the mining company. For example, recently, when a 1,000-kilowatt generator belonging to the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau was being moved from outside the city gate to the train station, it had to cross a small bridge. The local head of the baojia demanded an exorbitant bridge toll of 6 billion from the mining company, threatening to prohibit passage otherwise. The mining company offered to rebuild the bridge if it was damaged, but the offer was rejected. The issue has remained unresolved for months. The mining company had no choice but to take a detour, spending an extra half-month and a large amount of transportation fees, and it still hasn't reached the train station. This is one example of how it affects coal mine construction. The coal smoke emitted by the Wang Jiayuan Coking Plant flies everywhere. The owners of the mountain and wilderness grasslands have even demanded that the mining company purchase these useless lands because the coal smoke has fallen on them and made them unsuitable for "cultivation." When the Quanjiangyan Power Plant planted electric poles to supply electricity to the Gao Keng mine, they dug holes less than one meter wide, and the landowners demanded several dou of grain for each pole's usage.</p>
<p>There are countless similar demands. The mining company tries every possible means to maintain good relations with both parties in order to promote its own business. However, the people of Pingxiang believe that the mining company's employees are treated generously, which has stimulated the lives of the local people.</p>
<p>Miner's Illnesses: There are 4,000 people engaged in mining in Anyuan and Gao Keng (excluding private local mines). A serious problem currently is the medical equipment and the health of the miners. The mining company has established a clinic in Gao Keng, which is headed by Dr. Liu Zhantai. The internal facilities are rudimentary due to limited funding and housing. It is really difficult for them to cope with the medical needs of these employees day and night. On average, there are 400 outpatient visits every day. They also have to cope with home visits within 40 li of the mining area and free consultations for the local people. Sometimes, Dr. Liu has to return from visiting miners' homes late at night. One day, a family member of an employee of the Quanjiangyan Power Plant had a miscarriage. Because there was no midwife available, and Dr. Liu was a man, he could not enter the house. He had to stand outside the window and instruct his wife to perform the operation through the curtain. The baby was born, but it had stopped breathing. Fortunately, it was resuscitated with artificial respiration. Now it is a chubby little baby.</p>
<p>The common illnesses in the mining area are dysentery and malaria, mainly caused by drinking water, mosquitoes, and eating coarse rice. According to the clinic's diagnosis statistics, dysentery and malaria account for 80% of the patients, and some have died from malaria. Recently, there was also an incident of coal poisoning among the miners. Fortunately, it was diagnosed and treated in time, and no tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>Improving Diet: The miners' lives are laborious, and they can only afford a rough meal for a single person with their earnings. Now, most of the underground workers in Gao Keng and Anyuan are from Hunan. The natives of Pingxiang only work as a sideline during the agricultural off-season.</p>
<p>They are now eating coarse rice, which is harmful to their stomachs and causes dysentery and malaria. Therefore, Dr. Liu of the clinic emphasizes improving the miners' diet. He would rather spend a few more coins on the miners' welfare to avoid incurring considerable medical expenses. As long as the welfare undertakings can be strengthened, so that these workers who are buried underground all day long can get proper entertainment and their spirits can be properly entrusted, it can also reduce the bad habit of "gambling and eating everything."</p>
<p>The average miner has no proper organization or entertainment outside of their work in the coal mine. Therefore, after the monthly salary is paid, they gamble and eat as much as possible. As long as they have enough money left for a pack of cigarettes, they will spend it all before going down to the mine to work. Currently, the average income of an ordinary miner is about 20 yuan in gold coins, which is only enough to maintain a single person's life. What's more, there are so-called "contractors" and "cooperative contractors" above these coolies, who not only have to get a share of the wages from the miners, but also receive a salary from the mining bureau.</p>
<p>The mining area is in a wilderness of deep mountains and forests. There are only a few brick office buildings, Western-style houses, and the chimneys of the power plant constantly spewing out wisps of smoke, still maintaining the original form of the Chinese countryside. As for the construction of culture and education, it still needs to be redoubled.</p>
<p>Gao Gong Moves to Pingxiang: Currently, Gao Keng has a "Gao Gong" school, funded by the Ministry of Education and managed by the Department of Education, with mining and mechanical engineering departments. It was established in Gao Keng to train mining and metallurgical talents. However, the rudimentary housing has prevented this highest institution of learning in the mining area, which has only one year of history, from developing. This semester, it has been agreed with the Pingxiang County Council to move the school to Pingxiang, temporarily using the County Council as the school site to continue recruiting two new classes of students.</p>
<p>Miner's Children: The coal mine workers' children's school is also located in Gao Keng, and currently has more than 300 students. The children of the mining company's employees only account for one-third of the students, and the majority are students who have dropped out of school nearby. They only charge a small fee for the books they bring themselves, and everything else is provided by the mining company. There were originally two bao schools in the area, but they have been closed and all the students have been taken over by the employees' children's school.</p>
<p>Currently, the biggest trouble for every employee of the mining bureau is that, in their spare time, in addition to the above-mentioned lack of proper entertainment, it is not easy to see even a good newspaper. The fastest it takes to see a Changsha newspaper here is four days, and a Shanghai newspaper takes a week to arrive. Before the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was open to Zhuzhou, it was even slower. The fastest it would take would be ten days. Magazines and other publications have to be bought in Pingxiang. Sometimes, even a toothpick or a bar of soap is not easy to buy in Gao Keng.</p>
<p>Pingxiang Culture: However, the reporter must point out that Pingxiang is a county with a higher level of culture in Jiangxi. It now has two provincial secondary schools and seven county and private middle schools. The scale of the county elementary school is not easy to see in other counties in Jiangxi, with more than 1,000 students. The educational expenses are entirely based on public grain. Currently, a teacher in the county middle school and the Ao Middle School receives 200 shi of white rice per year. If converted at the current price, it can be compared to a specially appointed official. However, among these teachers, there are some who have served as department heads or professors in universities. Because they are mostly from Pingxiang, they are required to serve their hometown as usual, and can also engage in personal further studies and writing in their spare time from teaching.</p>
<p>The development of national education has not only met the standard of one school per bao, but even one bao has as many as four or five national schools, and the national education fund is entirely derived from public assets. They do not need to hold field tax additional school grain to maintain it. The quality of teachers is mostly from high school or normal school graduates. There is no lack of national education teachers in Pingxiang. On the contrary, the future of many middle school graduates has become a problem. Now, they mostly find a way out in township work. Many bao chiefs are appointed by middle school students. Therefore, if it is said that the three countries have the possibility of changing their pro-Greek policies, then the possibility of the southern country is greater and more peaceful. This is credible and without any objections. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Tragic Incident in Fengtai; Mole Crickets Ground into Flour; Four Die from Poisoning; Fourteen Others Hospitalized and Still in Danger</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] A shocking poisoning tragedy occurred in Fengtai Town, southeast of Beiping. Zhang Zhan'ao, a 66-year-old resident of Machang Village, had a family of ten, including his wife, sons, daughters-in-law, relatives, and hired laborers. Due to the harvesting of peanuts and corn, they hired eight new laborers, making them very busy every day. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang were in charge of cooking at home. On the 7th, while making pancakes at noon, they mistakenly used mole cricket powder, an insecticide, as white flour and kneaded it into the pancakes. After the sixteen people finished their work and had lunch, Zhang's youngest grandson began to show signs of poisoning, vomiting and diarrhea. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang and the relatives and hired laborers working in the fields returned one after another, and there was chaos with shouts, vomiting, and diarrhea. At this time, Mr. Zhang realized that they had been poisoned and shouted for help, alarming many neighbors. The Zhang family was sent to the railway hospital for treatment, but it was too late. Four people who had been severely poisoned died, and the remaining fourteen are still in danger.</p>
<h3>International Background of the Greek Border Conflict (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in Europe for This Newspaper</p>
<p>Recent Developments in Yugoslavia</p>
<p>[Continued from page 5 of this newspaper on the 9th] When the United Nations investigated the Greek border conflict last year, it concluded that Yugoslavia provided the most aid to the Greek rebels among the three countries of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. The Balkan Committee's inspection in March also confirmed that the so-called "Greek Democratic Provisional Government" led by Markos had its radio station located within Yugoslavia. Therefore, in the international handling of the Greek issue, Yugoslavia's attitude is of utmost concern. Moreover, Yugoslavia's geographical location between Albania and Bulgaria makes its position crucial, as even a slight move can affect the entire situation. However, since the friction between Yugoslav leader Tito and the Cominform (Communist Information Bureau) in June of this year, there has been a sense of impending crisis and complete transformation. Recent reports indicate that Yugoslavia's aid to the Greek rebels has decreased compared to the past, and the so-called "Greek Democratic Provisional Government" radio station seems to have been moved out of Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, on the surface, Yugoslavia's attitude towards Greece has not improved, and its non-cooperation with the Balkan Committee remains unchanged. However, it is generally believed that Yugoslavia's democracy has declined and its economy is extremely fragile after the war, especially in terms of coking coal and gasoline, which require 300,000 tons annually and must be supplied by Albania and Romania. Now that these two countries have refused to supply them, Yugoslavia must find alternative economic solutions unless it reconciles with Moscow. However, the past rift is deep, and it is doubtful whether they can restore their old friendship. Furthermore, the discord between Yugoslavia and Greece originally stemmed from the issue of the Macedonian region. Yugoslavia hopes to turn the Macedonian region into a puppet autonomous regime in order to annex it into the Yugoslav Federation at an opportune moment, while the Greek rebel leader Markos hopes to establish a communist regime based in Macedonia. Bulgaria, due to geographical, historical, and ethnic ties, has always been interested in Macedonia, and its desire to intervene has been growing. Therefore, although the three parties share a common attitude of hostility towards the Greek government, their dreams differ, and hidden problems are deep-seated. Although Tito's break with Moscow stemmed from placing national ideology above international communism, it was also due to the inability to coordinate his country's interests with those of his allies, which is particularly evident in the case of Greece. Recently, there have been widespread reports that the situation on the northern border between Yugoslavia and Greece has improved, with soldiers on both sides talking to each other in a very friendly manner. However, given the deep-seated animosity between Yugoslavia and Greece, and the current unstable situation in Yugoslavia, it seems premature to say that Yugoslavia can immediately lay down its weapons and become a saint. Nevertheless, considering that Yugoslavia is a member of the United Nations and maintains diplomatic relations with Greece, the level of its assistance to the Greek rebels is still lower than that of other nations.</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices - A Frenzied Buying Spree Sweeps Across Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Finance and Economy, the Shanghai market, which had been stable for more than a month, has seen a frenzied buying spree in the past week, with people rushing to buy goods, breaking the long-standing calm. Government-sold goods and goods from some large stores were opened early in the morning, and large numbers of customers were waiting outside, rushing in and buying up the goods within two to three hours. Among these customers, there were of course peddlers, but there were also those who were buying for their own consumption. This phenomenon is a great irony to the credibility of the Gold Yuan. We should not only scold those who are snapping up goods, but also analyze the reasons for the buying spree in order to eliminate it at its root.</p>
<p>First, the most fundamental reason for the buying spree is of course the excessive and loose amount of speculative capital, which has never found a proper outlet. According to the second announcement of the Supervisory Committee for the Preparation and Issuance of Gold Yuan, as of September 30th, a total of 956,752,494.40 Gold Yuan had been issued. According to the National Bank, out of the issuance of over 900 million Gold Yuan, the expenditure for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies amounted to approximately US$150 million, equivalent to 600 million Gold Yuan; the exchange of Legal Tender and Northeast Coupons amounted to approximately 50 million Gold Yuan; and the net income from import and export settlements and remittances from overseas Chinese amounted to approximately US$20 million, equivalent to 80 million Gold Yuan. The remaining 220 million Gold Yuan was used for treasury and other business expenditures after the currency reform. Although the authorities have intentionally pointed out that financial expenditures accounted for a smaller portion of this huge issuance, the harm caused by speculative capital in the market is indiscriminate regardless of its source.</p>
<p>Second, in order to increase tax revenue and balance the budget, the government has announced supplementary measures for reorganizing finances, stipulating that the collection of commodity tax, domestic tobacco and alcohol tax, and mineral tax may be adjusted. The Economic Control Commission of the Executive Yuan decided to first implement changes in the collection of taxes on cigarettes, flue-cured tobacco, tinfoil, imported beer, domestic alcohol, imported tobacco leaves, and domestic tobacco shreds on October 1st. The increase in these taxes was allowed to be added to the price of goods by merchants. Since the 3rd of the month, Shanghai has adjusted prices based on the central government's increase in cigarette and tobacco leaf tax rates, with cigarette prices increasing by 100% to 111%, and alcohol prices also being adjusted accordingly. Having suffered from high prices for many years, the people's psychology is extremely fragile. Therefore, they believe that since tobacco and alcohol taxes can be adjusted, other tax rates and even the prices of state-owned enterprises may also be adjusted, leading to a buying spree. Third, since the implementation of price controls, Shanghai's control has been strict, adhering to the 819 price limits, while the control in other areas has been lax, exceeding the 819 price limits. Goods in Shanghai have long been seeking to escape to other areas, but due to control regulations, they cannot be moved in large quantities. Under these circumstances, scalpers have emerged, accumulating small amounts into large quantities, which has also had a significant impact on the formation of the buying spree.</p>
<p>Fourth, according to general judgment, since the implementation of price controls, prices in Shanghai have been at a relatively low level in terms of Gold Yuan, causing raw materials and local products from other areas to be hesitant to come in. Within Shanghai, raw material prices are higher than finished product prices, and factory prices are higher than retail prices, leading to a shrinking of production and a shortage of supply. This is one of the reasons for the current buying spree and is a barrier that must be overcome for the implementation of the new economic plan in the future. In terms of the commodity market last week, due to the buying spree and the scarcity of supply, many goods were suspended. The cotton yarn and cloth market had already decided at the end of the previous week to suspend trading and discuss cotton yarn and cloth allocation methods as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to prevent the rise in cotton yarn and cloth prices, the authorities ordered the cotton yarn and cloth markets to suspend trading from today and strictly cracked down on intermediaries.</p>
<p>(2) Every citizen of Shanghai will be allowed to purchase 1.5 zhang (unit of length) of cotton cloth from October onwards, with the purchase date stamped on their national identity card for identification. They will not be allowed to purchase again within three months.</p>
<p>As a result, the cotton yarn and cloth market was completely shut down and without trade from the beginning of last week. In terms of the grain market, rice arrivals were scarce, and the northern market was suspended for several days, while the southern market was in a semi-suspended state. On Tuesday, only 441.5 shi of rice arrived in the southern market, 43 shi on Wednesday, and 453.5 shi on Thursday. On Friday, both the northern and southern markets had slightly more arrivals, but transactions could still be done. The flour market remained completely suspended, and edible oil was also ordered to be suspended. Although miscellaneous grains were not completely suspended, very little trading took place. In terms of daily necessities, cigarette prices have been approved to increase, while soap and matches only had sporadic transactions. Under price controls, very few large-scale transactions were made. Following cigarettes, there are discussions to increase the price of woolen yarn and kerosene by 50%, but the management office has not yet approved it, and the market is in a stalemate.</p>
<p>In the face of last week's frenzied buying spree, the most pressing measure for the authorities is of course to start with restricting purchases. However, the implementation of a comprehensive fixed allocation system, although advocated for a long time, cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, they have no choice but to retreat and deal with it piecemeal, including:</p>
<p>(1) Implementing the purchase of cloth, wool, and woolen yarn with identity cards. Each person is limited to purchasing 1.5 zhang of cloth every three months, one set of woolen clothing material per year, and 1.5 pounds of coarse woolen yarn or 1 pound of fine woolen yarn per year. After the purchase, the store will stamp the national identity card, and no further purchase is allowed within the specified period. The Social Bureau has already notified relevant guilds that this method of limiting purchases with identity cards will be extended to silk, shirts, socks, soap, and other daily necessities in the future.</p>
<p>(2) In order to limit consumption, it is stipulated that a "no meat on Friday" campaign will be enforced.</p>
<p>(3) The Paper Industry Association has obtained approval from the Social Bureau to restrict paper purchases. Those who already have paper allocation quotas, such as bookstores and printing industries, are not allowed to purchase paper from paper stores. Paper will not be supplied to other areas for the time being, and individual paper purchases are limited to 5 reams.</p>
<p>The wholesale price index classified by usage last week is as follows:</p>
<p>The wholesale price index classified by processing degree last week is as follows:</p>
<p>The wholesale price index classified by country of production and sales last week is as follows:</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Economic Supervisory Office expanded its jurisdiction area under the order of the Executive Yuan, it held an economic control meeting in Beijing on the 7th and passed: (1) Measures to strengthen economic control and liaison in this area, (2) Measures to regulate the supply of important materials in this area, (3) Measures to strengthen economic management in this area. Among them, the main point of regulating the supply of materials is to universally implement a fixed quantity allocation system for daily necessities in all provinces and cities, strictly inspect and register the quantity of materials, and lower the prices in production areas to the 819 standard. For market prices that are too high, reasonable adjustments can be made with the approval of local governments based on costs and legitimate profits. At the same time, the government and merchants will cooperate to purchase from production areas to replenish the source of materials. It is also reported that the central authorities are discussing the implementation of a comprehensive allocation method, which will imitate the British wartime allocation system, universally inspect and register materials in consumer markets and production areas, and then allocate them at fixed quantities and prices based on the actual number of people and consumption volume.</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance - Goods Are Being Rushed to Purchase, but Credit Remains Loose - Capital Supply Is Abundant, and Underground Interest Rates Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Last week, the loose credit situation in the city not only did not ease but even intensified. After the price of tobacco and alcohol doubled, there was a widespread phenomenon of rushing to purchase goods in the market. At the beginning of the week, the demand for bills of exchange increased for a time, and depositors in the industry's firms also withdrew their deposits to purchase goods. However, on the one hand, the deposits of consumers in the firms decreased sharply, while on the other hand, the deposits of stores increased significantly. For example, after the settlement of accounts of firms after No. 60 Taishifu, although there was a shortfall of 450,000 yuan on Monday, there was a surplus of 1 million yuan on Tuesday, which shows that the capital supply within the industry is generally abundant. After Wednesday, transactions in various industries were sparse, and the demand for bills of exchange declined again. As a result, the supply of capital in the market far exceeded the demand, and speculative capital had no way out and had to flood the market.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the speculative capital gathered in Taishifu has exceeded 600 million yuan. Therefore, the authorities also panicked and ordered national banks to stop announcing exchange surpluses from Tuesday in order to suppress the floating public sentiment. At the same time, it is reported that the publication of underground interest rates in the market will also be banned; however, on the one hand, the announcement of exchange surpluses is stopped, and on the other hand, it is reported that national banks still maintain an average daily deficit of several million yuan, which is also one of the main reasons why credit remains so loose.</p>
<p>As a result of the rush to purchase or escape goods, the inventory of many stores has become scattered, but as far as the entire market is concerned, since the price benchmarks have not been raised, speculative capital has only been transferred from the hands of some people to the hands of others. Therefore, rushing to purchase goods not only does not reduce speculative capital, but also increases the threat of loose credit due to the further approach of goods to the consumption field. As for the sales of short-term treasury bonds and shares of state-owned enterprises, which can tighten credit temporarily, the sales volume in a week was only about 10 million yuan, so it will naturally not have any effect on tightening credit. It is reported that this situation is a manifestation of the inability of speculative capital to contract and the inability of the government to control it. Indeed, an extremely severe test has been placed in front of the new currency system.</p>
<p>The underground interest rate last week, although it once rose to between 6% and 9% per month due to the increased demand for capital at the beginning of the week (it was between 4.5% and 5.4% at the end of the previous week), it then fell back to around 5% from Wednesday. As for the interest rates posted by the silver and money industry, they fell again on Tuesday, with deposit interest rates falling from 1.5% to 1.35%, overdraft interest rates falling from 4.8% to 3.9%, and interbank lending rates falling from 3% to 2.4%. The discount rate for cash was around 2-3 yuan per yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6-9%. According to reports, the results of the exchange of national banks were 4.28 million yuan on Monday, and 4-5 million yuan on Tuesday, falling to about 1 million on Wednesday, and still maintaining a deficit of several million yuan on Thursday.</p>
<p>The results of the exchange of foreign banks showed a surplus of 1.17 million yuan on Monday, about 800,000 yuan on Tuesday, and still a surplus on Wednesday and Thursday. The capital of commercial firms remained consistently loose. The settlement of accounts of firms after No. 60 Taishifu showed a surplus from Wednesday to Thursday, except for a deficit of over 1 million yuan on Monday, which shows that the capital supply is abundant.</p>
<p>Last week, the domestic remittance rates of commercial firms were relatively stable. The remittance rate to Guangzhou was 24 yuan, to Xiamen 2 yuan, to Chongqing and Kunming 12 yuan, to Hankou 10 yuan, and to Beijing and Tianjin 5 yuan. There was no change in the official exchange rate. Due to the lack of sources of ornamental gold, the gold shops in the city have voluntarily stopped buying and selling gold jewelry.</p>
<p>The market price in Hong Kong was HK$309.5 per tael of gold at the end of the previous week. It rose to HK$316.5 on Monday of last week and then rose to HK$319 on Wednesday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was HK$5.21 at the end of the previous week, rising to HK$5.25 on Monday of last week and then rising to HK$5.33 on Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Trends - Industry and Commerce Under Price Controls</h3>
<p>The Economic Control Commission of the Executive Yuan recently approved the tax rates for seven types of goods, including cigarettes, flue-cured tobacco, imported beer, tinfoil, domestic alcohol, tobacco shreds, and tobacco leaves, in various parts of the country, which will be increased by an average of 70% to 100% from October 2nd. According to Supervisor Jiang, this will increase the government's revenue by 34 million Gold Yuan per month, which shows that the adjustment of tax rates is imperative for the government. The recent surge in the purchase of goods in the city, and the adjustment of tobacco and alcohol prices, should be one of the immediate causes. From this, it is not difficult to see that although the government's income has increased, the industrial and commercial sectors have once again been hit by turbulent waves. In addition to this, in order to increase the government's income, the Ministry of Finance has also increased the import tax on cotton and the export tax on cotton cloth. The Textile Export Committee believes that this will strike a blow to the textile industry and has requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance to reduce or exempt the taxes; it is obvious that reducing tax rates will affect the government's income, so the success of the tax reduction application is also difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>In order to increase its income, the government's state-owned enterprises were also brewing price increases last week; as a certain legislator said, if state-owned enterprises do not raise prices, the government will not be able to survive, obviously, state-owned enterprises have no choice but to raise prices.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the public utilities in Taishifu have also encountered difficulties. According to reports, since the prices of public utilities were frozen, various companies have experienced great difficulties due to the increased cost of gasoline allocation. Furthermore, as far as the coal needed for public utilities is concerned, although the coal allocated for October has been allocated from the Shanghai supply, the future source of coal is said to be that the coal from Qinhuangdao can no longer be transported. Although there are 500,000 tons of coal in stock at the Kailuan Coal Mine, only 20,000 tons can be transported this month due to traffic obstacles. Other coals, such as those from Huainan and Tanggu New Port, are also transported in small quantities, and the amount of coal stored here is less than 40,000 to 50,000 tons. For this reason, the public utilities have sent a telegram to the central government requesting the restoration of subsidies, but it is feared that there will also be problems with whether the subsidies can be approved. If this is the case, then public utilities will also be forced to adjust prices following state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>To ensure that the price control policy is consistently unchanged, a sufficient supply of raw materials is naturally one of the main conditions. The Economic Supervisory Office has also made its best efforts in this regard, such as restricting the export of materials, conducting general warehouse inspections, and textual propaganda, etc.; but the authorities' control over materials is also very urgent. For example, the Chinese Farmers Bank has acted as an agent for the Ministry of Food to purchase flour for six times, purchasing a total of 3.62 million bags. Also, the China Trust Bureau has joined forces with oil mills to start purchasing rapeseed. According to a report from the Central News Agency, the Bureau has sent personnel to production areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and expects to collect 65,000 dan (unit of weight) of rapeseed within a month. Whether the industrial and commercial sectors can be allocated a portion of the materials purchased by these many authorities is, of course, a problem, and as for other raw materials needed for production, it is said that currently, apart from the fuel part, where the Diesel and Gasoline Allocation Committee of the Transportation Management Commission has decided to supply all the needs of the industrial sector, procurement is very difficult. Not to mention other things, such as the raw materials for the wool textile industry, according to the current Economic and Social News, the raw materials stored by the 77 member companies of the wool textile industry in the city are only enough for more than a month. Furthermore, as for the production of vegetable oil, according to the authorities of the Central Vegetable Oil Factory, although the output in September was similar to that in August due to the sufficient inventory of raw materials, there will be problems with the output in October due to the lack of raw materials.</p>
<p>Although the far cause of this large wave of purchasing materials is of course the continuous outflow of Gold Yuan, the immediate causes are the increase in tax rates on some goods and the scarcity of supply of production raw materials; the future of the industrial and commercial sectors is obviously full of difficulties, because even if the inventory of industrial raw materials is indeed as the spokesperson of the Economic Management Office said, sufficient for several months of use, if there is no appropriate limit to the issuance of Gold Yuan and the adjustment of tax rates, then the so-called "psychological factors" of purchasing materials may still be a difficult to cure chronic disease.</p>

<h3>Fuxing Cup Mini-Football Tournament Concludes: Samsung Wins Championship</h3>
<p>The Samsung mini-football team defeated Central Aviation with a score of 1-0 on Double Tenth Festival, winning the Fuxing Cup. Because it was National Day, the audience was enthusiastic, so both sides played especially well. Although Central Aviation lost, their strong offense and excellent performance were praised by the audience, and success or failure should not be the only measure of their quality. Referee Fang Rongfu enforced the rules impartially, earning high praise. Zang Wenbin and Zhu Yishi assisted on the sidelines and were also deemed competent. After the match, Samsung immediately carried away the silver cup amidst the sound of firecrackers. The second Fuxing Cup League, which lasted for three months at the Municipal Sports Ground, has now concluded.</p>

Xiao Ziwen took the penalty, and the ball was fast and powerful. Dong Jincai calmly blocked it, winning enthusiastic applause. Afterwards, Central Aviation used the tailwind to put pressure on Samsung, but to no avail. After changing positions, the competition became more intense, but both sides moved very clearly and played beautifully. Although there were many close calls on both sides, due to the strict defenses, the outcome did not change until the end of the match. Samsung returned in triumph with a score of 1-0.</p>

<h3>A Little Trip to Gusu</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>It's been half a year since I went to Suzhou, and things are a little different. There are very few rickshaw pullers by the train station, probably because they have long been swept away by the throngs of incoming passengers. I barely managed to hire a horse-drawn carriage, which charged two yuan to go from the station to the Guanqian Street bus stop. When I arrived at the bus stop, the people waiting for the bus were already packed together in a large crowd. As soon as the bus arrived, everyone rushed up. The entrance was narrow, making it difficult to squeeze in at once. Several soldiers climbed in through the bus windows. The situation was very dangerous. Although I had accumulated more than ten years of experience squeezing onto trams in Shanghai, it was difficult to compete with them. Just then, the horse-drawn carriage I had taken earlier came back to solicit business, saying, "Why don't you just take the horse-drawn carriage?" As a result, I jumped into the carriage, of course...</p>
<p>On the section of road between Guanqian Street and Xumen, the horse-drawn carriage had an obligation to give free rides to special figures. They would jump on for a while and then jump off. If you didn't let them ride, they would glare at you angrily. But once past Panmen, when the carriage was on the highway, the hitchhikers disappeared.</p>
<p>There are particularly many flies in Suzhou. Buzzing, they constantly circled the horse-drawn carriage. From Suzhou all the way to Mudu by bus, they wouldn't leave, flying away and then coming back. It's late autumn, but the potential power of flies in Suzhou is still very strong. As soon as you get to a restaurant in Mudu, it's full of flies, flying around the tables, just like the commotion of the tourists.</p>
<p>Up on Lingyan Mountain, things were still the same. On the mountain, I saw a large fat man touring the mountain, with a bamboo sedan chair carried on the shoulders of four strong country women. The large fat man was still panting for breath from the bouncing of the bamboo sedan chair. My companion said that this wasn't a large fat man touring the mountain, but rather we were seeing the City God making an inspection tour. The scene was indeed about seven parts similar.</p>
<p>At the top of the mountain, there were people selling Coca-Cola, asking for three jiao five fen. I asked them if they could sell it at the price limit. The reply was that there was no price limit here. What a place for black market transactions beyond the law!</p>
<p>Only halfway up the mountain could you see a distant view of the lake, with faint sails and sandpipers. It was just a bit too far away, giving only a sense of vastness and lacking a sense of intimacy. This is why Lingyan Mountain is ultimately not as good as Yuantouzhu.</p>
<p>From Lingyan Mountain to Tiger Hill was another long horse-drawn carriage ride. The people in the carriage shouted about being lonely. The coachman said that it was all the fault of you Shanghai people these past few years, "Wanting to be fast, fast!" That's why there's no more business for horse-drawn carriages. Actually, the scene of galloping along the deep autumn highway to the sound of hooves isn't bad. The flies were still hiding on the coachman's back and next to the passengers. The horse-drawn carriage was like the palm of the Tathagata Buddha, and the flies couldn't fly out. Later, I used a bamboo hiking stick to fiercely eliminate them, and after more than ten minutes of waving it in the air, the flies actually retreated completely and no longer harassed the surroundings.</p>
<p>The degree of inclination of the Tiger Hill Pagoda is almost comparable to that of Pisa. The entire scenic area has entered a state of decline, lacking artificial cultivation and maintenance. Even scenery gets old. On the other hand, the small river on Shantang Street reminded us of the lingering charm of the folk tale "Three Smiles Romance." One of my companions, a descendant of the recluse Tang Yin, was quite proud of his handsome appearance, which he attributed to the inheritance from his "grandmother."</p>
<p>The horse-drawn carriage entered the city, and a young soldier jumped on again at the entrance of Guanqian Street. The coachman said that he would stop at the Xuanmiao Temple, but the soldier replied, "I only need a ride to the Xuanmiao Temple." He spoke with a Sichuan accent, so I started chatting with him in the Sichuan dialect. He said that he had been a soldier for ten years and was too poor to afford the expenses to return to his hometown even once. Those who ride the carriage are certainly annoyed by the hitchhikers, but other than hitchhiking, they really don't have the money to pay for the carriage. And they regard hitchhiking as entertainment. Even on the short stretch of road from Chayuanchang to Zhengshanmen, they enjoy "hitching" as a form of entertainment.</p>
<p>The shops closed one after another at six o'clock, which reminded me of the gloomy atmosphere of Suzhou during the war years. The guests at Songhe Lou were getting more and more crowded. Fortunately, the waiters were skillful and would answer impatient diners politely, so the customers had no reason to get angry with them. It was still early to go to the train station after dinner, so I slipped to the Daguangming Theater in Beiju to watch an hour of "Princess Shui Lian," which was just a way to kill time.</p>
<p>I left the theater at exactly nine o'clock and returned to Guanqian Street. I saw that the front of Songhe Lou was heavily guarded, with a large crowd of onlookers. It was said that someone had come to eat but couldn't be served, causing a big scene, and several people were injured from a distance. Fortunately, we had eaten dinner earlier and were not caught in the crossfire. Such is the scenery of troubled times.</p>
<h3>Remembering Zhao Yaosheng</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Ta Kung Pao Chengdu special dispatch reported "Sichuan Elder Zhao Xi Passed Away." The passing away of an established man could not help but make one sad.</p>
<p>Zhao Yaosheng (Xi), whose pen name was Xiang Song, enjoyed great fame for his poetry, calligraphy, and painting for several decades. In the late Xuantong period, he was transferred from compiler of the Hanlin Academy to Supervisory Censor of Jiangxi Province. At that time, it happened that Sheng Xuanhuai, the Minister of Posts and Communications, had requested and was approved to borrow foreign funds and advocated that the railways be nationalized. The Qing chiefs accepted Sheng's memorial and announced the railway policy, stipulating that trunk lines should be nationalized and branch lines should be built by merchants according to their capabilities. All previously approved railway cases were cancelled, and resistance would be treated as a crime of violating imperial orders. Therefore, the railway turmoil in Sichuan was provoked. Mr. Zhao and Ou Jialian, standing in their position as censors, filed an impeachment against Sheng Xuanhuai. As a result, Zhao's honest reputation spread throughout the country. Not long after, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was overthrown. He lived in Hangzhou for some time, then returned to his hometown of Rong County, Sichuan, using composing poetry, writing lyrics, writing calligraphy, and painting to pass the time. He also worked hard to improve Sichuan Opera, often adapting old plays, re-editing the plot and lyrics, such as changing "Capturing Wang Kui Alive" to "Love Investigation" and the like, is one example.</p>
<p>There were several elders in Sichuan, such as Yan Kai, Fang Xu, Song Yuren, Yin Changheng, Liao Ping, and Xu Zixiu, etc. Society called them the Five Old Men and Seven Sages. He was also one of them. More than ten years ago, they often jointly expressed their opinions on provincial administration and local undertakings to fulfill the responsibilities of local elders. During the period of warlord separatism, rising and falling one after another, each occupying one side, doing all kinds of evil, but they were very respectful to these old men. Once, civil war broke out in Sichuan and fighting broke out in Rong County, but the military commanders on both sides agreed not to fight in the alleys near the East Gate, because Mr. Zhao lived in the East Gate. Zhao wrote in a letter to his friend Fei Jun, "My county is in the mountainous area. This time, nearly 300,000 soldiers on both sides will be exhausted even to eat millet. ... Seven or eight hundred people die at once (about 50,000 casualties on both sides). I was fortunate to be protected by the generals on both sides. The books and inkstones inside the door were still neatly arranged, unaware of the events. However, sitting in the sea of artillery fire, the sound of bullets was like rain, and the sound above my head was like the cry of a hungry kite. Machine guns and mortar shells were fired, and the alley battles in the city shook the mountains and the ground. Refugees often gathered in the cold house, and sometimes soldiers also did. At that time, it could be called Xin Taiping Zhai, and after thinking about it afterwards, my soul was terrified."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's poetic skills were profound, vigorous, and concise, and he wrote very quickly. Those who don't know him think that his poems are the result of hard work, but in fact they are spoken offhand without any refinement. When Yang Zengluo was transferred to Sichuan, Zhao wrote thirty bamboo branch poems to see him off, describing the scenery from Hubei to Chengdu when entering Sichuan. Chen Yan asked Zhao to write them on a horizontal scroll, and Zhao added four more poems at the beginning and end to give to Chen. The next day, Chen visited Zhao, and Zhao's farewell poems had expanded to sixty. Chen and Yang were deeply impressed when they saw them.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, in my correspondence with him, I mentioned Cheng Baijia's recent situation. They used to be extremely good friends, but later lost contact, and both missed each other very much. After reading my letter, Mr. Zhao immediately wrote two seven-character quatrains for me. The poems said: "As time passes, the setting sun approaches, and the red trees of the old year have undergone several frosts; the green bird from the cloud has no news, and the intestines are broken as the mottled turtle ties to the Land Wolf. A letter tells of Baijia due to the wind, and the old friend is still drifting on the shore; at Maple Bridge, there is a little rain, and don't ask Wu Niang for lotus flowers!"</p>
<p>Liang Qichao devoted his life to writing essays and did not write much poetry. Later, when he wrote poetry, he most admired Mr. Zhao. Therefore, whenever he wrote poetry, he would definitely send it to him for revision. From Liang's posthumous works, there are several five-character long lines sent to Zhao Yaosheng, which shows Liang's great respect for Zhao.</p>
<h3>Jie Lian Huan - Remembering the Past in Jinling</h3>
<p>— Nei Shaohong</p>
<p>It's late autumn in Moling, and the Milky Way casts its shadow, with a faint moon trace; tracing the old traces, after calamities, the desolate palaces and temples are far away on the mountains, covered with grass. A clear heart reflects under the silent sky. Considering hundreds of years have passed, does the Stone know whether the times are cold or warm? The night in Qinhuai turns with the sound of the leak, listening to the singing of the businesswomen, singing in resentment. They only resent the meat-eaters scheming, so they defend the Huai River and block the river; the old path is in front of us, don't make another miscalculation! Who will I teach this peach blossom at the bottom of the fan to re-enact?</p>
<h3>Mulanhuajian</h3>
<p>The dark clouds are not resolved, and the autumn rain beats all night long. The guest sleeves are cold, and the thick feelings want to be sent, ten thousand strands and thousands of lines. Full of Xiao, blowing and sinking the islands, can't bear the remaining fragrance, the waves wipe out the duckweed. Looking at the Hua Gai of pearls, I'm waiting to listen to the rain. Tomorrow, I'll break the lake bridge. The long pavilion willow is far away. I guess who can tie up the goodbye, and only leave a goodbye dream, the dream is also boring. The sound of Sheng Xiao, passes on the hidden complaints, I'm afraid to urge the return to the dark soul! There is still some awakening that has not been bought, and then the wine warms the flag.</p>
<h3>American Snippets</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jian</p>
<p>Today, women employees in the United States no longer work solely for needle and thread money, 84 percent work to support themselves or their families. This is a report by Secretary of Labor Schweilenbach.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army shoe has changed its style, with an added eighth of an inch to the small toe side of the toe, the purpose of which is to "improve foot hygiene." This is the first style change since 1912.</p>
<p>A report by the Federal Security Agency: The U.S. birth rate has been rising year after year, with 3.91 million babies born in 1947, 440,000 more than the previous high of 1946.</p>
<p>Inflation in the United States has not yet ended. Private universities cannot balance their income and expenses, and have raised tuition fees. Yale University's annual tuition has risen from $450 to $600. Tuition at Columbia University has increased by one-third, and dormitory fees have increased by 17 percent.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced: U.S. living expenses rose seven-tenths of a percent in May of this year, up 70.5 percent from the 1935-1939 average.</p>
<h3>Fake Fingerprints</h3>
<p>— Nanwu</p>
<p>Modern detectives attach great importance to fingerprints. A fingerprint on the handle of a pistol can often strongly indicate who the murderer is. Even if the person identified as the suspect vehemently protests their innocence, the judicial authorities often pay no attention—who told them to leave that fingerprint?</p>
<p>However, in recent years, American detectives' views on fingerprints have changed considerably. The reasons are: (1) fingerprints can actually be faked; (2) sometimes other people's fingerprints can be used to commit crimes, while the person whose fingerprints are used remains completely in the dark, without any knowledge. In other words, it used to be "planting evidence," and now there is "planting fingerprints."</p>
<p>Not long ago, a jeweler in Chicago was very interested in faking fingerprints and often created several sets of fake fingerprints as a pastime in his spare time. Later, he was imprisoned for endangering public safety and got along very well with the prison warden. He told the warden that he could fake fingerprints and hoped the warden would allow him to publicly demonstrate this unique skill for legal circles and criminology experts to use as a reference. The warden, after hearing this, thought it was complete nonsense and ridiculed him for a while. The jeweler had no choice but to resign himself to his fate and continue serving his sentence.</p>
<p>A few days later, he went to see the warden again. When he entered the warden's office, he found it empty. It turned out that the warden was still on his inspection round and had not returned. There was a safe in the office. The jeweler had a sudden idea, opened the safe, took out some money, and quietly walked away. The next day, the warden discovered that some banknotes were missing from the safe and was shocked. He immediately called the police. The detectives looked through a microscope and found clear fingerprints left by the thief on the safe door—upon closer inspection, they turned out to be the fingerprints of the warden's son!</p>
<p>Just as the warden was feeling ashamed, angry, and not knowing whether to laugh or cry, the jeweler walked in. He returned the money to the warden and specifically stated that his purpose in doing this was to let the detectives know that fingerprints can be faked and can be "transferred." The warden naturally felt relieved after hearing this, and the shrewd and capable American detectives gained a new understanding of fingerprints from then on.</p>
<h3>Reader</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Social General Living Conditions reported in this newspaper on the 6th, rickshaw drivers can earn ten gold yuan per day! That is 300 yuan per month, which is much better than a senior official (those with a salary of 600 yuan only get a little over 120 yuan). There is also a saying in Peiping that "those who pull rickshaws have a better life than those who ride in them." Two-wheeled rickshaws (commonly called "foreign cars," also known as "rubber tires," what Shanghai calls "yellow package cars") in Peiping have been almost completely eliminated, and "three-wheelers" are everywhere. Those who work in this profession are called "stepping on three-wheelers," but they still ask those who hire them, "Where to?" This is partly due to habit, and partly because "stepping to where" is not a proper phrase.</p>
<p>Bargaining for rickshaws in Peiping has always had its own special unit of currency. In the early years of the Republic of China, people always spoke of so many "zi'er." More recently, it was three or five "zi'er" for short distances and ten or twenty "zi'er" for long distances. The so-called "zi'er" refers to copper coins, which are called "copper plates" or "copper jiaozi" in the south and "copper zi'er" in the north. The abbreviation is "zi'er," and this is used as the unit of measurement. However, the rickshaws in Dongjiaomin Lane quote prices in "mao." The minimum fare is one "mao," which is one jiao of silver. This is because pulling foreigners is particularly aristocratic, and passengers who pay with "mao" don't care about the price. Secondly, the rickshaws in Dongjiaomin Lane are relatively clean and luxurious, and the rickshaw drivers are also more energetic and efficient, probably because they cater to foreign customers. Chinese people who hire rickshaws in Dongjiaomin Lane naturally follow the foreign practice of pricing in "mao," so there were two units of currency at that time: "mao" and "zi'er." This remained the case until before the Anti-Japanese War. Although the cost of living gradually increased and prices rose, from several "zi'er" to several dozen "zi'er," and from one or two "mao" to three or four "mao," it never deviated from "mao" and "zi'er." Although banks or stores may account for a few "mao" and a few "fen" or even "li," rickshaw drivers never used the term "fen." Beyond "zi'er," it was "mao."</p>
<p>The current situation is somewhat different, because the asking price is either "several mao" (gold yuan) or "several tens of thousands" (legal tender). These two units, "wan" and "mao," never have denominations of a few "fen." It is expected that after the old legal tender is completely phased out by the end of November, only "mao" will be used as the unit of currency.</p>
<p>Currently, hiring a "three-wheeler" for the shortest distance costs at least one "mao." From Xuanwumen to Xidan Archway, it costs two "mao." Yesterday, I saw an interesting incident of hiring a rickshaw. The asking price was only "two mao," but the counter-offer was "fifty million yuan." Other cases of bargaining for goods with an asking price of "one yuan" and a counter-offer of one hundred and twenty million yuan (i.e., four jiao) are common, which is amusing.</p>
<p>The public buses in Peiping have been suspended due to unsustainable losses, and the buses have been auctioned off to pay off debts. The trams are barely maintained, but are mostly dilapidated and in need of repair, on the verge of collapse. When it comes to "getting around," one can only rely on one's own two legs.</p>
<p>Three-wheelers have become a scarce "commodity." From the North City to the South City, it costs one yuan or eight "mao." It is not surprising that each person earns more than ten gold yuan per day. Three-wheelers are not as physically demanding as two-wheeled rickshaws, so it is not too tiring to travel north and south more than ten times a day.</p>
