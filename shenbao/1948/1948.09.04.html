<h3 id="c1">中蘇十年航空協定　我已通知無意續約　明年九月滿斯後即失效 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕政院新開局長　顯光二日宣布，一九三九年簽訂之中蘇航空協定，將於明年九月滿期，我交通當局已依照協定條文規定，通知蘇方無意續約，該協定屆期即將失效。至於外國政府或私人飛機有在中國境內飛行者，不論飛行何地或爲何國飛機，事先均須取得中國有關當局之許可。記者按：中蘇航空協定，係民國廿八年九月九日簽訂，爲期十年，但協定第十六條規定：「在期滿前一年，任何一方未表示廢除，則繼續右效五年」。協定簽字之始，在迪化成立之中蘇航空總公司及伊寗·哈密兩航空站，對我抗戰初期物資之批運及西北貿易之發展頗多貢獻，乃其後新　政局熒生變化，且該公司業務向操蘇方人員之手，協定簽立之初衷已失，迨伊寗事變，北塔山戰役先後發生，協定之在在對我更毫無利益可言，然條文規定中蘇航空總公司之虧損均由雙方平均負担。據悉：去歲我方負担之虧損達一五〇萬美元，至該公司爲我方訓練航空人員之責任則竟未予履行，新疆人民對該協定早視爲「事實上之不平等條約」，第一屆國大第一次會議中，曾通過楊永頤等所提之「請即宣布廢除中蘇航空條約案」，決議送請政府注意，政府果取斷然措施，中蘇雙方自將開始商談結束中蘇航空公司之一切事宜。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京三日電〕此間三日一般許論，中國希望結束中蘇航空協定，係義示政府對蘇態度之強硬化，在遇運三年間，中國政府之對蘇態度，一向被評擊為過於軟弱。接近外外部方面並稱：結束照會，必將廓淸一切疑慮。認爲政府將允許大量擴展蘇聯在西北之航空權，以滿足蘇聯之慾望。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕外交部時昭瀛司長，二日在新聞局答復記者詢問稱：王外長將經由曼谷及新德里飛往巴黎，在上述二地時，將與印暹政府當局會晤，他沒有訪問莫斯科的計劃。</p>

<p>〔中央社京都三日電〕張羣今在此向「關西區」日本工業界領袖發表談話稱：惟有保證日本「澈底民主化，及完全拒絕軍國主義」，中國始願協助日本之經濟復原。張氏並促日人注意，在簽訂和約之前，日本與外界之大規模貿易及健全之經濟關係，並無希望，目前中日關係在佔領制度下，乃屬「間接」者。張氏認為一俟和約簽訂後，中日兩國即可恢復「正常及良好」之關係，戰後的兩國關係，將與戰前完全不同。必須以「公允嶄新之基礎」建立之。氏又吿「關西區」日本工業界代表稱：渠來日之眞正任務，乃在觀察日本是否眞正走上民主之途，一如三年前日本投降後我蔣總統在廣播演說中所昭示者，戰後我國對日政策，決不採報復態度，論及戰前日本對華經濟政策時，張氏稱：此爲日本軍閥財閥及一部份主張侵略之議員所共同厘訂之計劃，日本經濟家及工業家雖非此一政策之厘訂人，但彼等曾協助推行此一政策，終致造成對華之侵略戰爭。就此點言，日本經濟家與工業家應與日本軍閥負相同責任。</p>
<p>〔又電〕張羣商震二氐三日午前出席我僑民之歡迎大會。張氏向六百餘華僑致詞時，强調華僑敎育之重要，並籲請僑民中受有良好敎育者，尤其台灣籍僑民中之智識份子，起而領導各僑團，建立良好之聲譽與道德，張氏對若干台籍者在日本之成功，甚表稱許。按預定日程，張氏一行將於午後往遊京都　宮，暨其他名勝。晚間則將赴此間美軍參謀長之歡宴。</p>

<p>偵杳經過甚曲折陶妻妻弟均拘傳</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕各方矚目之洩　改革幣制秘書，及於改革幣制前夕在滬大量拋售永紗股票空頭投機牟利一案之主角，業已查明爲財政部秘秘書陶啓明，，渠於十八日晚獲得改革幣制之秘密，即當晚由京乘快事來滬，於十九日長命其妻李國蘭在證券第二三七號經紀人杜維屏所主持之鴻與證券號內，拋出大批永紗股票，陶即於十九日晚車匆匆返京。澈查該案當局，於二日下午將陶妻李國蘭逮捕後，即電京財政部王部長雲五，於當晚十二時將陶扣押，送首都警察廳覊押，並將於日內解送來滬併案辦理。</p>
<p>此案之偵查經過，至爲曲折，負責偵查工作者，爲監察委員唐鴻烈·孫玉琳·監察院參事范體仁。財政部參事周德偉·上海區經濟督導員蔣紹國。金管局長林崇墉·市警局副局長兼特刑處長張師，經濟警察大隊長程義寬等。先是蔣督導員接獲密報，於日前飭令市警局經濟　達大隊拘獲與此案有關參與拋空達一千六百萬股之某證券巨商由是而獲得破案之鑰，揚破此一謎案，辦案局根據談證券巨商供給之綫索，於二日上午傳詢證券二三七號經紀人鴻興　券號負責人杜維屏，及巨商盛頻臣（即盛老七）·由唐鴻烈、孫玉琳。一范豐仁。周德偉。張師·程義寬·及金管局副局長畢德林等，在警局七樓會同偵詢，歷五小時吿一段落。</p>

<p>〔本報南京三日電〕內長彭昭賢三日晚接見本報記者談：渠對於被捕之陶啓明，主張嚴懲，此種敗類，應送特種刑庭審判，並處以死刑，因陶身爲公務人員，又係財部秘書，竟利用其職務上之便利，乘機圖利，實屬罪不可這。記者詢其此案是否尙有其他牽涉？彭稱：現尙在偵查中，惟如涉及其他人員時，亦應同樣嚴懲，此可爲政府是否有決心實施財政經濟緊急處分令之考驗，政府決認眞辦理。</p>

<h3 id="c17">大家趕快緊縮節約！ <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>行政院經濟管制委員會，爲配合經濟緊急處分令各項規定普遍推行節約運動起見，特建議行政院組設節約指導委員會，不久即可開始工作；至於節約具體辦法，聞已由中宣部　擬中。凡是熱悉我國經濟情形的人，無不認爲經濟改革必須厲行緊縮節約，所以這次中樞提倡節約運動，如能提出切實易行的辦法，將爲這次經濟改革獲致成功的有力因素。</p>
<p>政府以絕大的決心，頒佈財政經濟緊急處分命令，澈底改革中國經濟，企圖從崩潰的邊緣挽救過來，其所採取的四項辦法，最重要的一項，莫過於「整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法」。翁院長曾經說過：這一次的改革是「以改革幣制爲中心，以嚴格控制預算，平衡國庫收支，加强經濟管制，穩定市場物價爲方法，以達到安定經濟，安定民生爲目的。」從翁院長這段談話中看來，也可以知這政府當局對於這次經濟改革的實施方法，完全集中在這項辦法。所以這次經濟改革的成敗，完全要看這第四項辦法能否澈底執行而定。</p>
<p>從政府頒佈這個財經緊急處分令之後，迄今將近兩星期，在這兩星期內，我們曾看到善良人民擁護政府改革幣制熱忱的，一般持有黃金白銀與外幣的人，都爭先恐後向國家行局爭兌金圓券；同時我們也看到政府陸續頒佈了許多補充條款，對於管制物價，取締國積投機，以及穩定市塲，也都有了更嚴密的辦法，表示政府對於這次經濟改革「只許成功，不許失敗」，確實具有絕大的決心。在人民和政府通力合作的條件之下，我們看兩星期來的情形，不能不承認這次經濟改革，已獲良好的開始，對於我國經濟好轉的前途，似乎大可樂觀。但從另一方面來觀察，例如游資的鬆濫尙未能疏導入生產的正途，工商界對於硬性限價的不平，各種物價的漲達限度，以及投機商人的蠢蠢欲動，使我們對於這些潛伏着的危機，不能不特別提高警覺。防微杜漸，應早作未雨綢繆之計。</p>
<p>我們認爲目前的要圖，首在緊縮與節約。在國家言，如何控制預算，如何平衡收支，必須大刀鬧斧，先從緊縮入手。由人民而論，如何安定經濟，如何安定民生，也要先從節約做起。關於這一點，政府當局在第四項辦法中，也已有許多規定，例如第四條規定：「各種國營事業，應極力節省浪費，栽汰冗員」；第六條規定：「文武機關員工士兵名額應嚴格嚴實，不得浮濫」；第九條規定：「凡可輸出之物資，應獎勵其增加生　，並得限制國內消費」；第十二條也規定：「凡物賢須由國外繪入者，應厲行節約」。但這些規定，都祗是原則的規定，還需要具體細密的實施辦法。政府對這方面的指施，尙嫌不足，而需要積極實施，已是刻不容緩的了。</p>
<p>關於國家預算，據王財長談稱：「今後總歲出預算，如能力從撙節，控制得宜，每年實際支出當能减至九億美元之等鑪，即金圓卅六億圓。至於歲入方面，可達二十四億六千萬圓，收支相抵，所短之數爲十一億四千萬圓」由此可知，政府在極力緊縮之下，收支尙難平衡。如果政府把這些規定還觀爲官樣文軍，不欲付諸實行，則歲出歲入如何可望平衡？此着如果失敗，全局必爲牽動！同時，在人民消費方面，我國經過八年抗戰之後，又遭共匪叛亂，元氣大傷，確已到了民窮財盡的地步，物資的缺少，是不可否認的事實。人民如不能做到「勒緊褲帶」，不浪費一絲一毫，不糟塌一分一釐，則欲安定經濟安定民生，也將變成不切實際的空話。</p>
<p>要之，戰時的英國和戰後的英國，如何節衣縮食，克服經濟上的困難，實在是我國經濟改革的最好榜樣。政府有沒有厲行緊縮的決心？人民有沒有實行節約的自覺？將爲這次經濟改革成敗之所繫！</p>

<p>〔本報南京三日電〕立院財金委會臨時財產稅施行條例草案初步審查小組，二·三兩日上午均開會討論，臨時財產稅條例草案中，因政府於八月十九日頒布財經緊急處分令後，有應行修改之處，決定重要修改兩點：（一）臨時財產稅起征點，原草案爲戰前幣値五萬元，經修改爲金圓券廿萬元，財產滿此價額者一律課稅百分之五，以上仍採超額累進稅率，至最高財產價額超過二千萬元者，就其超過額課稅百分之六十。（二）納稅之財產列舉之項目中，刪除黃金·白銀及外幣，因依據「人民所有金·銀·外幣處理辦法」第二條已明白禁止其流通，買賣或持有，政府於兌換期限屆滿後，當可予以沒收，自不應再列爲課稅對象。此兩項修改之決定，將由小組建議財金委會，經全體委員會議討論通過後，方提報於院會，至施行條例草案本身，小組將繼續根據國稅署及該委會專門委員所之兩初稿審查修訂，俾復交全體委員會議討論，</p>

<p>該庭判決理由，認爲林王公司王眷哲故違政府法令，大事經營黃金，美鈔，港幣之黑市買賣，並利用電信經營各種外匯，爲避免政府檢查，另備賬冊，使用階號，以爲交易通信之用，交易地區遠及紐約，舊金山，倫敦，香港及汕頭等地，自卅六年十二月以後，至卅七年三·四月，其買賣黃金，美鈔，港幣，私套外匯，數目驚人，實足以影響全國經濟，釀成社會不安，斷非普通商人希圖蠅頭小利者可比，亦非一·二個人財力所及，顯係暗中另有組織，意圖妨害戡亂，故處以極刑以昭烱戒。至共犯鄭嘉裕候另案通緝。林同識，鄭禮恭尙不能證明有共犯罪嫌，故判處無罪。又大中華公司張延盛之私營港匯業務，雖自卅六年五月份起，但在彼時中央銀行管理外匯條例，尙無處罰私人經營外匯之明文規定，應不爲罪，祗於卅七年二·三月部份之套匯應予處罰，其罰與林王公司不同，故判處有期徒刑五年。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自經濟緊急措施令頒行以來，本市一般反應尙屬良好，惟仍有一部份商人意存觀望，囤積居奇，更有？人甘胃不韙，繼續經營黑市金鈔外匯及股票塲外交易。上海區經濟督導員辦公處對此早予密切注意，前日該處正式成立檢查委員會，開始以鐵腕展開驚人行動，予此輩以嚴重打擊。迄昨日爲止，遭逮捕者已有由新紡織總公司總經理榮鴻元，紙業公會理事長詹沛霖，永泰和烟行經理黃以聰，吳錫記棉布號經理吳錫麟，金鈔黑市巨犯韋伯祥，證券交易所經紀人杜維屏，股票商林樂畊等七人，經傳訊警吿者有永安紗廠副經理郭棣活，油業公會理事長張超，米業公會理事長萬墨林等三人。</p>

<p>囤積之貨物沒收或收買</p>
<p>上述各被捕人犯，均將由警察局解送司法機關嚴辦，其囤積居奇之貨或予沒收，或由政府收買。高氏繼稱：經濟督導員辦公處取締此輩不法份子，乃爲維持正常市面，故對於正當商人將儘量保護，惟囤貨觀望者決無好處，因我人此項政策絕對執行到底也。</p>
<p>蔣經國氏於招待會將完畢時，應記者之邀，出席作兩分鐘之談話。渠希望商人勿存觀望，並稱，管制政策係自生產至消費全部管制，包括產區貨源在內。關於棉紗決責令民營紗廠直接售與生產事業，不使落入掮客囤積之手。記者詢以八一九前夕某巨頭拋空永紗案是否已查出，蔣氏稱一二日內全案明瞭後即吿公佈云。</p>

<p>忍受少許犧牲·並非毫無價值</p>
<p>關由蔣經國　致詞；一中國遭八年抗戰，三年戡亂戰爭，現在國家在風雨飄搖，民不聊生之時，經濟已至非革不可地步，故此次幣制改革，爲國家民族生死存亡關頭，只許成功，不能失敗。幣制改革成功，則中國尙有復興之望，如不幸失敗，則大家同歸於盡，現在希望各位擁護改革幣制政策，最主要一點爲恪遵八一九之限價買賣，不得任意提高物價，過去物價在漲，有如洪水氾濫，如不築堤防範，必至淹沒一切，故八一九限價政策，爲防止洪水泛濫，此後爲設法疏導，使游資納於正軌，中國現在最需要者爲安定，欲求秩序安定，必先造成安定環境。抑平物價爲安定環境的方法，在八一九限價下，各位也許要忍受少許犧牲，個人吃虧，求大衆生存，使大家有飯吃，此種犧牲，幷非毫無代價。</p>
<p>只要能遵法令·不願多找麻煩</p>
<p>余亦知八一九限價非十全十美之辦法，惟在今日不失爲救急之一法，余在上海，知道有許多人討厭，惟余作事，素主合法，合情，合理，只要大家能遵守政府法令，不陽奉陰違，余亦不願多找麻煩。在今日中國如仍敷衍，不肯切實力行，則一切良好政策均不能實現。至於各工廠之困難，政府將設法解決，絕不願見工廠關閉。關於原料問題，另有物資調節委員會處理，希望本市各工業團體恪遵，協助政府，亦即救自己。上海爲全國經濟中心，一舉一動影響全國者甚大，如能率先將物價抑平，必能爲全國各地模範，各位如有困難，請儘量發表意見。」　帆布業，造船業，製針業，紡織用品業，塘瓷業，橡膠業，造紙業，鋼鐵煉製業，印刷業，內衣業，毛紡業等代表，一」申述各該業困難，綜其大要兩點：（一）原料困難，工廠製成品照限價批發出售，但原料無法補進。（二）希望政府勿增加稅率，致有領導漲價嫌疑。</p>
<p>大家不肯檢舉·訴苦無濟於事</p>
<p>末有蔣氏答覆。。「聽到各位發表意見之後，知道上海物價有這許多問題，剛纔我講過管制物價分（一）防止泛濫，（二）疏導兩種。限價，檢查倉庫等，均係防止泛濫辦法，是補助辦法，將來工作重心尙在疏導方面，即運用物資調節委員會，務使生產事業供求不處匱乏，如需要花紗原料，可開畢至物資調節會，實成紗布公會拋紗，直接拋與紗廠，另再將倉庫中囤積之花紗沒收拍賣，紗廠原料決無問題。適纔印刷業申述困難，謂缺乏白報紙，爲何對囤積白報紙之紙商不于檢舉，此次紙商詹沛霖扣押，查出該商囤積白報紙甚多，有勝利以後國積至今者，大家皆不肯出頭檢舉，光知訴苦缺乏原料，無濟於事，只要你們知道何處有囤積貨物原料，我想辦法爲你們查出來應用，希望大家能不顧情面，檢舉囤積抬價奸商，愛護扶植正當工商業，在合法，合理，合情之辨法下，使本市工商業能一天天發達起來，緊榮起來」</p>

<p>市政建設捐部份，原經市參會通過，亦係根據前項房捐基數，採用超額累進計算方法，分甲乙丙丁戊五等，分別加成四〇，五〇，六〇，七〇，八〇倍計數。現幣制改革，此項倍數自亦消滅。惟爲遵照參議會之決議案起見，仍採超額累進計算方法，分等按率徵收，以示公允，而平稅負　辦法：一，房捐以重行估定之房屋總値，仍照向例以其一成爲徵捐基數，其捐率營榮用房屋徵百分之十，住家用房屋徵百分之五。二，市政建設捐採超額累進計算辦法，以前項房捐基數爲徵捐基數，其等級捐率如下表：戊等，一—三〇〇元，捐率百分之六。丁等三〇一—五〇〇元，百分之八。丙導五〇一—七〇〇元，百分之十·乙等七〇一—九〇〇元，百分之十二。甲等九〇一元以上，百分之十四。市長以該案亟待執行，昨特備文連同徵收細則修正條文，，提請市參會公決。</p>
<p>戰前各種金屬輔幣　張一渠建議准流通</p>
<p>張一渠提，爲建立人民對於幣制改革之基層信心，應迅電中央建議，在各種金屬輔幣鑄造未完竣以前，暫准民間通用戰前之各種舊金屬輔幣案。辦法：援照舊銀元與金圓券之法定比例。規定如下：舊銀幣及舊鎳幣一角者，准各抵金圓券二角。二角者准各抵金圓券四角。舊當十銅幣，亦准以一分流通使用。</p>

<h3 id="c90">胡適談新聞工作　歷史考證與報道任務 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>北平校長胡適博士此次應邀出席平市記者節慶祝，，以歷史考據家親身經歷，闡述新聞工作之困難，並以「勤·謹·和·緩」四字相勉勵，本報已有北平一日專電刊出，惟語焉不詳，茲節錄全文（中央社記錄）要點如次：</p>
<p>博士以記者自許</p>
<p>胡先生發言時，出示其一九四一年在美被請爲美新聞記者兄弟會（Sigma　deltwchi）名譽會員之紀念章，以記者自許。渠稱：「我從事歷史考證，亦是記錄報道工作，偶而亦寫些時論，希望包括在記者羣內」。繼以幽默而動人之語調講述其對新聞工作之認識謂：渠於偶然中從事考證「水經注」，希望三個”完成，但由三個月而半年，一年，以至今五年，參考書已堆滿畫齊，然仍不敢下結論，此一百五十年前之「水經注」，經過王國維·孟森·劉器之等學者考證，對兩本百分之九十相同的書的作者戴東原，趙一淸兩先生，褒貶不一。我發覺他們都動了火氣，以致於不能冷靜的去完成考證，從此可知考證一件事實的困難，亦就是說新聞工作報追事實之不易翔，但做歷史老證與新聞報道相同，必力求眞實。胡先生繼舉出西安事變與七五事件爲例稱：一我沒有聽到兩個人叙述任何一件事有相同內容」，並引用赫胥黎名言：「說出我相信如此」，是一種審愼任務，在「不能相信如此」時，須愼下結論，因爲新聞記者的文字就是將來歷史家的村料。</p>
<p>朱熹的一句名言</p>
<p>胡先生又引用理學大師朱熹名言：「勤·謹·和·緩」四字，勉酈新聞記者稱：「這在朱夫子收集在小學裏一個關於劉器之進士的故事中。我自己亦以此四字處世」。胡先生解釋此四字謂：「勤是不偸懶，謹是不苟且，縱一字之微，都不放過。這兩點是記者的必然條件，不如此，不足以成功。和是心平氣和，做記者而不能淸除成見，則記戴必偏倚，毀掉一個人很容易。臂如「列子」裏尊盜斧的故事，就是例子。新聞報道一要摒棄政治的成見，黨派的成一見。</p>
<p>多方面收集事實</p>
<p>緩慢，記者要求適得其反，但我認爲寗可多收集一點事實，晚幾分鐘送到編輯部，不要在搶快中草率從事，因爲記者筆下可超生，亦可以殺人。我前幾天讀聯合社百年紀念一本冊十，對於他們發展機械與電訊的應用深爲欽佩。我並不反對在傳遞上力求迅速，而反對撰寫稿件的快速，須要從多方面尋求事實，雖則比別人慢，但眞實而正確。胡先生旋叙述其考證「醒世姻緣」一書之緩慢情形稱：這部怕老娑的書，是一等名著，但作者是假名字，東亞書局重印時，打紙版後請我作序，我請他們等一等，等考證出作者。當時我已假定是「聊齋」作者蒲松齡，但不敢下筆，五年之後，我才找到一點資料，證明是蒲公，作了五萬字的長序，書才出版。故新聞必須發出時，證據不足，寗可懸而不刊。」胡先生作結語稱：「希望在可能範圍內緩一點，刀下留情」。</p>

<h3 id="c99">新幣之力在香港 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港卅一日航訊〕在香港商塲一片淸淡，四大百貨公司聯合作戰後第一遭减價聲中，新幣制呱呱墮地，這是一個喜訊，給半絕望的人們帶來了熱望。</p>
<p>這一週來，「濕柴」—法幣的別號—已不再掛上人們的嘴角。若干人已用不着爲了嫌惡「濕柴」而奔來香港了。過去帶着關金來港換取港元的人，現正紛紛挾着港幣奔回廣州去。這幾天廣州中央銀行收兌港幣的成績（已達一千餘萬元），略可想見這個趨勢是如何的蓬勃。</p>
<p>另一方面，國家銀行和郵匯局在港也做着一筆很好的生意，行局內平時「門可羅雀」的匯兌部，近來已給匯款回鄉的僑胞弄得熱烘烘的。記者親到郵匯局去調查，得見若干城市的匯款之多，如厦門·汕頭·寗波，已非當地郵匯局所能付出，局方迫於無奈宣佈「額滿見遺」，通知匯款人到國家銀行那邊想辦法。這是戰後的罕有的好現象，吸收僑匯這句話，今天才首次發見實際的效用。</p>
<p>國內米價和香港米價（每担六七十元）比較，前者僅及後者三分之一，香港小市民間近來普遍的談着：「廣州的伙食每月僅費十多金圓，我們回去討生活吧。」根據低至無可再低的港府勞工處報吿：港中工人每月生活費也在四十元以上。這兩個數字的差別，將成今後香港人口增减的決定因素。</p>
<p>新幣制的出現，確掀起香港的一個新的轉機，一部份人士雖還帶着陳舊的觀望和懷疑，但他們也不得不脫下有色的眼鏡去正視現實了。</p>

<p>〔中央社香港一日電〕港政府昨（卅一日）午夜，在此間西南海岸緝獲一艘滿載走私品之美製魚雷艇，艇上人員並有機槍步槍及手槍等武器，艇長凡六十英尺，滿載私貨如次：計四十七箱紙烟，七桶汽油，二六〇箱火油，二百袋食　，茲已經稅務司全部充公。該艇原泊於本島西南隅一人跡少至之碼頭近處，在準備就緒即將他駛之午夜，爲緝私艇所獲，艇上雖備有武器，但未及用作抵抗。該艇速率每小時逾卅浬，料係經常走私港澳穗間，因其速率特高，常令中國海關及港政府緝私船無法趕上，故此尙係緝獲此項速率特快走私艇之首次。</p>

<p>自經濟緊急處分令頒佈後，對於物價實施全面管制，旬餘以來，已有良好之表現，惟因金銀外幣之　換，市塲遊資汎濫，物價波動堪虞。據經濟督導員蔣經國氏昨晨語聯合徵信所記者，疏導游資，政院正研究辦法，一面管制物價，一面疏導游資，雙管齊下，經濟自可安定。疏導之道，如拋售物資，出售國營事業及敵僞產業，與發行公債，均屬上策。目前政府已有若千配合管制之措施，拋售物資，筆已開始，國營事業即可出售‘至發行公價，最近亦將有辦法公佈。</p>
<p>又訊：工商部中國紡織建設公司，定今（四）日下午三時，召開第三屆第一次臨時董監聯席會議，討論該公司發行股票等事宜。陳兼董事長啓天，將親自來滬生持。據悉：紡建股票，預定於本月十日發行，股票金額每股爲金圓一百元，計分一股，十股，五十股，一百股，一千股，等五種，刻正由十餘家印刷公司趕印中，限本月八日以前，將應繳部份，送達發行金圓基金監理委員會後，即辦理發行手續。</p>
<p>又據最近負責估計紡建資產之某權威人士稱：紡建目前全國所有資產，總値約爲金圓拾二億元，已佔金圓發行總額十分之六，他如招商局等國營事業，亦將相繼出售，故金圓發行基金之準備，至爲充沛云。</p>

<p>米市漲抵限度，因產地價堅，來貨甚少，致供應不多，高貨米因限價之故，已吿絕跡，中次貨品充高貨成交，經濟警察監視交易，有若干行家，竟不做交易，米店納胃甚暢，因戶口米未發售，故門銷頗活。薄稻二十一元六角，特高粳二十二元六角，均抵限價。昨日到貨南北二市二九九〇石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>再見上挺，一度抵達限度，因原料價高，廠方連日不開，且吸收老棧單，兼因外埠價格上升，人心一致看高。老車·兵船·一開即抵限價，臨收因傳出貨期限不寬放，略見轉疲。老車軋升五分，兵船漲一角四分，建成升二角，餘皆加一角五分。麩皮挺至限價。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>按限價略有做開，交易不多，良以供應稀少，到貨寥寥。漢口乍豆供應本街略有成交，苞米烟台帮納取，交易最多，價格平定。元麥交少價定，紅糧開九元原價，蠶豆。茶豆·均爲零星交易。芝蔴開出七十包，由本街按限價分購，每戶二包。生仁廣帮成交近子包。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>上漲，已抵限度，因黃豆等原料無貨可購，油廠無開出，且其價格本屬較低，實銷見低納取。豆油大致抵五十二元限價，生菜油四十七元，各漲二元五角。吉桶生油按限開出三十桶，吉桶小車未開，舊桶小車蔴油五十二元五角，成交三桶。豆餅義記餅以四元六角開出三千多片，其他各牌無出戶。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕頃據茶業界透露消息：目前國外華茶價格，漸見抬頭，且前途迭露燦爛景象，原因爲我國政府防止輸出商貶價競銷，妨碍華茶在國際間之攸久信譽，同時爲爭取多量外匯，故對於各項花色，均有規定價格。例如本年屯溪珍眉，依照出口限價，C.IF.至少每磅須美金三角，他若本年祁門紅茶及平水綠茶，每磅最低爲二角。綜觀此種情形，外銷茶遂現起色。</p>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，仍因產價俏秀，複製成本依然　站，賣戶喊價迂迴上揚，是以趨勢振奮異常，行情一致帶挺。惟查交易，則在吐納談判相持中，續猶零星做開，至於內銷茶，進出互有，盤旋如故。</p>

<p>李世橋　李震中</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sino-Soviet Ten-Year Aviation Agreement: We Have Notified Our Intention Not to Renew; Will Expire After September of Next Year <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Chief Executive Yuan's Newly Appointed Director, Mr. Xian Guang, announced on the 2nd that the Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement, signed in 1939, will expire next September. Our transportation authorities have, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, notified the Soviet side of our intention not to renew. The agreement will thus expire when the term is up. As for foreign government or private aircraft flying within Chinese territory, regardless of where they fly or what country they are from, they must obtain permission from the relevant Chinese authorities in advance. Reporter's Note: The Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement was signed on September 9th of the 28th year of the Republic [1939] for a term of ten years. However, Article 16 of the agreement stipulates: "If neither party expresses its intention to terminate the agreement one year before its expiration, it shall continue in effect for another five years." At the beginning of the agreement, the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation established in Dihua [Ürümqi] and the aviation stations in Yining [Ghulja] and Hami contributed significantly to the transport of materials and the development of trade in the Northwest during the early stages of our war of resistance. However, subsequent political changes in Xinjiang and the fact that the company's operations were controlled by Soviet personnel meant that the original intention of the agreement was lost. After the Yining Incident and the Beitashan Incident occurred one after another, the agreement offered us no benefits whatsoever. Yet, the agreement stipulated that losses of the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation would be borne equally by both parties. It is understood that our side bore a loss of US$1.5 million last year, while the company failed to fulfill its responsibility to train aviation personnel for us. The people of Xinjiang have long regarded the agreement as an "unequal treaty in reality." During the First Session of the First National Assembly, the "Proposal to Immediately Declare the Abolition of the Sino-Soviet Aviation Treaty" submitted by Yang Yongyi and others was passed, with a resolution to request the government to pay attention. The government has taken decisive measures, and both China and the Soviet Union will begin negotiations to end all matters related to the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] It is generally believed here on the 3rd that China's hope to end the Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement signifies the government's hardening attitude towards the Soviet Union. During the past three years, the Chinese government's attitude towards the Soviet Union has been criticized as being too weak. Sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that the termination notice will clear up all doubts, dispelling the notion that the government would allow a large-scale expansion of Soviet aviation rights in the Northwest to satisfy Soviet desires.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated on the 2nd in response to reporters' inquiries at the Information Bureau that Foreign Minister Wang will fly to Paris via Bangkok and New Delhi. He will meet with government authorities in India and Siam [Thailand] during stopovers in those two places, and he has no plans to visit Moscow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Moscow Dispatch, 2nd] Bu Daoming, Director of the Department of Asian Affairs of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived here at 6 PM on the 2nd from Almaty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Moscow Dispatch, 3rd] Bu Daoming stated that he will travel to Paris to attend the United Nations General Assembly and only intends to stay here for a few days. He denied that he has any mission in Moscow.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Meeting with Industrial Leaders from the Kansai Region of Japan: Zhang Qun Discusses Sino-Japanese Relations, Saying Normalcy Can Be Restored After the Peace Treaty is Signed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kyoto Dispatch, 3rd] Zhang Qun, speaking here today to leaders of the Japanese industrial community in the "Kansai Region," stated that China is only willing to assist in Japan's economic recovery if Japan "thoroughly guarantees democratization and completely rejects militarism." Mr. Zhang also urged the Japanese to note that before the signing of a peace treaty, there is no hope for large-scale trade and sound economic relations between Japan and the outside world. Currently, Sino-Japanese relations are "indirect" under the occupation system. Mr. Zhang believes that once the peace treaty is signed, the two countries can restore "normal and good" relations, and the postwar relations between the two countries will be completely different from those before the war. It must be established on a "fair and new foundation." He also told representatives of the Japanese industrial community in the "Kansai Region" that the real purpose of his visit to Japan is to observe whether Japan is truly on the path to democracy, as President Chiang Kai-shek proclaimed in his radio address three years ago after Japan's surrender. China's postwar policy towards Japan will never adopt a retaliatory attitude. Speaking of Japan's economic policy towards China before the war, Mr. Zhang said that this was a plan jointly formulated by Japanese warlords, financial magnates, and some pro-aggression legislators. Although Japanese economists and industrialists were not the formulators of this policy, they assisted in its implementation, ultimately leading to the war of aggression against China. In this regard, Japanese economists and industrialists should bear the same responsibility as Japanese warlords.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhang Qun and Shang Zhen attended a welcome meeting for our overseas Chinese here on the 3rd.

According to the scheduled itinerary, Mr. Zhang and his entourage will visit Kyoto Imperial Palace and other scenic spots in the afternoon. In the evening, they will attend a banquet hosted by the Chief of Staff of the U.S. military here.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] Following reports of people selling large amounts of stocks before the currency reform, the President ordered a thorough investigation and severe punishment. The main suspect, Tao Qiming, has been arrested and confirmed to be the person selling the stocks. Weng Wenhao reported the details of the Tao case to the President on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] The "reclusive figure" who attracted national attention for leaking the secrets of the currency reform and profiting from it, has been identified by the government as Tao Qiming, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, after days of investigation by relevant government departments. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Finance personally sent a letter to the Capital Police Department, and he was arrested on the night of the 2nd. After capturing Tao Qiming, the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department conducted a secret interrogation on the night of the 2nd and the morning of the 2nd. Once the interrogation is complete, he will be sent to the judicial authorities for trial within a very short period of time in accordance with the law. As the case is significant, it will be sent to the Special Criminal Court for strict handling.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu Speaks</p>
<p>According to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Finance's statement on the 2nd, the Ministry of Finance learned that someone took the opportunity on August 19th to sell a large number of Yong An Textile stocks at the Shanghai Stock Exchange for profit. At that time, he secretly ordered the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau and the Stock Exchange supervisor to conduct a secret investigation. Later, he personally sent a letter to the Shanghai Economic Supervisor to conduct a thorough investigation, and then sent Counselor Zhou Dewei to Shanghai to assist in the investigation. At 6:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 2nd, he received a phone call from Director Lin of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, reporting that the case had obtained concrete leads. According to the broker who handled the sale, the person who sold a large number of Yong An Textile stocks on August 19th was Li Guolan, the wife of Tao Qiming, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. Tao's wife confessed that her husband arrived in Shanghai by train on the night of the 18th and ordered her to sell the stocks. After learning of this, the Ministry of Finance not only ordered Director Lin to take custody of Tao's wife, but also detained Tao Qiming around 12:00 p.m. on the 2nd and temporarily detained him in the police station for interrogation. As a government official, he engaged in such illegal activities, which is truly hateful. The government will certainly deal with it strictly in accordance with the law and will not tolerate it.</p>
<p>Details of the Arrest</p>
<p>According to reporters' investigation, when Tao Qiming was arrested on the night of the 2nd, Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu and Police Chief Huang Zhenwu personally took action. After receiving the phone call from Shanghai, Wang first met with Wu Xingzhou, Director of the Personnel Department of the Ministry of Finance, to request personnel reports and instructed him to find a way to detain Tao. Around 8:00 p.m., Wu Xingzhou, together with Huang Zhenwu, Director of the Police Department, and Zheng Haoming, Captain of the Criminal Police Team, discussed the matter of arresting Tao Qiming with Minister Wang Yunwu at the Ministry of Finance. Wang gave Huang the photo of Tao, and ordered Wu to rush to Xiaguan Railway Station with many staff members to prevent Tao from fleeing upon hearing the news. Wang, Huang, Zheng, and others led police officers to search the Ministry of Finance dormitory. Tao happened to be out watching a movie. He was brought back around 11:00 p.m. After entering the dormitory, he was about to undress and go to sleep when a plainclothes police officer came to his room and said that he had just come to Nanjing from Shanghai and that a friend in Shanghai had asked him to see Tao and had something to tell him, but it was inconvenient to talk in the room, so he asked him to talk outside. Tao Qiming did not pay any attention and went out with the police officer, and was immediately arrested. To prevent him from escaping, he was handcuffed at the time and taken to the Ministry of Finance Minister's office building first. Around 12:00 p.m., he was transferred to the Criminal Police Team headquarters.</p>
<p>Tao's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Tao is from Jiangsu Province, about 30 years old. He used to be a judge at the Kaohsiung District Court in Taiwan. After Wang Yunwu took charge of the Ministry of Finance, he was introduced to the ministry as a secretary by Xu Baiqi, the Chief Secretary. He took office in mid-July and has been in office for less than two months. He also served as the Deputy Director of the Information Office while in the ministry. Tao and Xu are both graduates of Soochow University.</p>
<p>The Investigation Process is Very Twisty; Tao's Wife and Wife's Younger Brother Were Both Detained and Summoned</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The protagonist of the case that attracted attention from all parties, involving leaking the secret of the currency reform and speculating by short selling Yong An Textile stocks in large quantities in Shanghai on the eve of the currency reform, has been identified as Tao Qiming, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. He obtained the secret of the currency reform on the night of the 18th, and that night he took a fast train to Shanghai. On the 19th, he ordered his wife, Li Guolan, to sell a large number of Yong An Textile stocks at the Hongxing Securities firm, which was run by Du Weiping, a broker at Securities No. 237. Tao took a train back to Beijing on the evening of the 19th. The authorities investigating the case arrested Tao's wife, Li Guolan, on the afternoon of the 2nd, and then wired Minister Wang Yunwu of the Ministry of Finance in Beijing, who detained Tao at 12:00 p.m. that night and sent him to the Capital Police Department for detention, and will send him to Shanghai in the coming days to handle the case together.</p>
<p>The investigation process of this case was very twisty. The people responsible for the investigation were Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, Counselor Fan Tiren of the Control Yuan, Counselor Zhou Dewei of the Ministry of Finance, Shanghai Economic Supervisor Jiang Shaoguo, Director Lin Chongyong of the Financial Management Bureau, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Department and Director of the Special Criminal Division Zhang Shi, and Captain Cheng Yikuan of the Economic Police Brigade. Earlier, Supervisor Jiang received a tip and ordered the Economic Task Force of the Municipal Police Department to detain a securities tycoon who was involved in the case and participated in short selling 16 million shares. From this, they obtained the key to solving the case and solved the mystery. Based on the clues provided by the securities tycoon, the investigation bureau summoned Du Weiping, the person in charge of Hongxing Securities firm, Securities No. 237, and the tycoon Sheng Pinzhen (Sheng Laoqi) for questioning on the morning of the 2nd. Tang Honglie, Sun Yulin, Fan Fengren, Zhou Dewei, Zhang Shi, Cheng Yikuan, and Deputy Director Bi Delin of the Financial Management Bureau, etc., jointly interrogated them at the police station on the seventh floor, which lasted for five hours.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, Du Weiping was summoned again. As the case was difficult and required further details, he was detained. It is said that Du was related to Lin Legeng, a stock trader who was also detained. It is said that Du had asked Lin to sell a large number of Yong An Textile stocks. After Du was detained yesterday, he requested to confront Lin once. The two were temporarily detained at the Huangpu Police Station that night and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. According to the Central News Agency, Tao's wife also provided some clues. Based on the clues provided by Tao's wife, Li Guolan's younger brother, Li Boqin, and several people named Xu were also detained and summoned. By this point, the case was largely clear, although it involved a wide range of people and still required further investigation. The main goal of the major investigation was to find out where Qi Ming obtained the secret of the currency reform. (Please see page 4)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, who were ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the leak of the currency reform secrets and the anonymous sale of Yong An Textile stocks, hurriedly left for Beijing last night because the main suspect, Tao Qiming, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, had been arrested in Beijing, in order to clarify the truth of the entire case. According to the two before their departure, after Tao Qiming was detained, he will be transferred to the court within 24 hours, so they urgently needed to rush there that night to obtain important confessions before he was transferred to the court and conduct a deeper investigation to clarify the truth of the entire case. They also said that once their mission in Beijing is completed, they will still come to Shanghai to continue the unfinished work.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] Zhou Dewei, Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, who went to Shanghai to assist in the investigation of the sale of Yong An Textile stocks, returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 3rd and immediately met with Wang Yunwu to report. It is reported that in addition to Li Guolan, there were two other people who sold Yong An Textile stocks in Shanghai. Also, a certain young master had sold 16 million shares from August 11th to 16th, and 12 million shares on the 19th alone.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Chief Secretary Xu Baiqi Reportedly Under House Arrest</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] New involvement found in the Tao Qiming case. Xu Baiqi, the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, who introduced Tao to work at the Ministry of Finance and is also Tao's superior, is reportedly under house arrest. After Tao was arrested, the Criminal Police Team interrogated him overnight. On the morning of the 3rd, the interrogation continued, and Chief Zheng Haoming personally conducted the interrogation. The interrogation room was equipped with the latest scientific instruments such as recorders and lie detectors to test Tao's heartbeat during the interrogation and search for evidence of his crime. It is reported that Tao has admitted to selling Yong An Textile stocks, but only admitted to selling 2 million shares and making a profit of only more than 1 billion yuan, but he firmly denied responsibility for leaking the news. Tao was wearing a gray Prince of Wales suit during the interrogation on the 3rd, with medium-length hair, wearing glasses. On the morning of the 3rd, Wang Yunwu and Xu Baiqi, Tao's introducer, talked in the upstairs office for a long time. At 12:00, Director Huang Zhenwu also came to participate, which lasted for about an hour before Huang left. Wang Yunwu also left, but Xu Baiqi did not come downstairs and is reportedly under temporary surveillance by the authorities.</p>
<p>[Another Wire] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu told a reporter at 3:00 that he had never allowed Tao Qiming to participate in the relevant plans for this currency reform, but when the reporter asked if other people were involved, Wang said that he did not want to express his opinion during the investigation.</p>
<p>Peng Zhaoxian Advocates Severely Punishing Those Involved in the Same Way</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] Minister of Interior Peng Zhaoxian met with our newspaper's reporter on the evening of the 3rd and said that he advocated severely punishing the arrested Tao Qiming. Such scoundrels should be sent to the Special Criminal Court for trial and sentenced to death, because Tao is a civil servant and the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, and he actually used his position to seek personal gain, which is extremely sinful. When the reporter asked if there were any other people involved in this case, Peng said that it was still under investigation, but if other personnel were involved, they should also be severely punished in the same way. This can be a test of whether the government is determined to implement the emergency decree on financial and economic matters. The government is determined to handle it seriously.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Everyone Hurry Up and Tighten Your Belts and Save! <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan, in order to universally promote the austerity movement in line with the various provisions of the Economic Emergency Measures, specifically recommended that the Executive Yuan set up an Austerity Guidance Committee, which will start work soon; as for the specific measures for austerity, it is reported that the Central Propaganda Department is drafting them. Everyone who is familiar with the economic situation in our country believes that economic reform must strictly implement austerity and saving, so this time the central government's promotion of the austerity movement, if it can put forward practical and easy-to-implement measures, will be a powerful factor for the success of this economic reform.</p>
<p>The government, with great determination, promulgated the financial and economic emergency decree to thoroughly reform the Chinese economy, attempting to save it from the brink of collapse. The most important of the four measures it adopted was "the method of reorganizing finance and strengthening economic control." Premier Weng once said: This reform is "centered on currency reform, and uses strict control of the budget, balancing of national treasury revenue and expenditure, strengthening of economic control, and stabilizing market prices as methods, in order to achieve the goals of stabilizing the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods." Judging from Premier Weng's remarks, we can also know that the government's implementation methods for this economic reform are completely concentrated on this measure. Therefore, the success or failure of this economic reform completely depends on whether this fourth measure can be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>Since the government promulgated this financial and economic emergency decree, it has been nearly two weeks. In these two weeks, we have seen the enthusiasm of good people in supporting the government's currency reform. People who hold gold, silver, and foreign currencies are rushing to exchange them for gold yuan at national banks; at the same time, we have also seen the government successively promulgate many supplementary clauses, which also have more stringent measures for controlling prices, cracking down on national hoarding and speculation, and stabilizing the market, indicating that the government is determined that this economic reform "can only succeed and cannot fail." Under the condition of cooperation between the people and the government, we cannot but admit that this economic reform has gotten off to a good start and seems to be optimistic about the future improvement of China's economy, based on what we've seen in the past two weeks. But from another perspective, for example, the loose flow of funds has not yet been channeled into the right path of production, the dissatisfaction of the industrial and commercial sectors with the rigid price limits, the limited rise in various prices, and the restless movement of speculators make us have to raise our vigilance about these latent crises. We should prevent problems before they arise and make preparations in advance.</p>
<p>We believe that the current important plans are first and foremost to tighten and save. In the state, how to control the budget and how to balance revenue and expenditure must be a major reform, starting with tightening. As for the people, how to stabilize the economy and how to stabilize people's livelihoods must also start with saving. Regarding this point, the government authorities have already made many provisions in the fourth measure, such as Article 4 stipulating: "Various state-owned enterprises should strive to save waste and eliminate redundant personnel"; Article 6 stipulates: "The number of employees and soldiers in civilian and military agencies should be strictly regulated and not be inflated"; Article 9 stipulates: "For all exportable materials, their increased production should be encouraged, and domestic consumption may be restricted"; Article 12 also stipulates: "For all goods that must be imported from abroad, austerity should be strictly enforced." But these provisions are only principled provisions, and more specific and detailed implementation measures are needed. The government's guidance in this area is still insufficient and needs to be actively implemented, and it is already urgent.</p>
<p>Regarding the national budget, according to Finance Minister Wang, "If the total budget for future years can be reduced through economizing and proper control, the actual expenditure can be reduced to the equivalent of 900 million US dollars per year, which is 3.6 billion gold yuan. As for the revenue side, it can reach 2.46 billion yuan, and the deficit after offsetting revenue and expenditure is 1.14 billion yuan." From this, we can see that even under extreme austerity, it is difficult for the government to balance revenue and expenditure. If the government still regards these provisions as official paperwork and is unwilling to implement them, how can revenue and expenditure be expected to balance? If this move fails, the whole situation will be affected! At the same time, in terms of people's consumption, after eight years of war, China has suffered greatly from the communist rebellion, and it has indeed reached the point where the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, and the lack of materials is an undeniable fact. If the people cannot "tighten their belts", do not waste a single bit, and do not squander a single cent, then stabilizing the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods will also become impractical empty talk.</p>
<p>In short, how wartime Britain and post-war Britain tightened their belts and overcame economic difficulties is indeed the best example of economic reform in our country. Will the government have the determination to strictly implement austerity? Will the people have the awareness to implement saving? This will be the key to the success or failure of this economic reform!</p>
<h3 id="e18">The Temporary Property Tax Threshold is Changed to 200,000 Gold Yuan; Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies are Removed from the Taxable Items; The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee Review Panel Passes the Recommendation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] The preliminary review panel of the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee on the draft temporary property tax implementation regulations held meetings on the mornings of the 2nd and 3rd. Because the government promulgated the financial and economic emergency decree on August 19th, there were some items in the draft temporary property tax regulations that needed to be amended. It was decided to make two important amendments: (1) The temporary property tax threshold, which was originally 50,000 yuan in pre-war currency value in the original draft, was revised to 200,000 gold yuan. Property that meets this amount will be taxed at a flat rate of 5%. The above will still adopt progressive tax rates, and the highest property amount exceeding 20 million yuan will be taxed at 60% on the excess. (2) Gold, silver, and foreign currencies were removed from the listed items of taxable property, because according to Article 2 of the "Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Owned by the People," their circulation, sale, or possession has been clearly prohibited. After the expiration of the exchange period, the government may confiscate them, so they should no longer be listed as taxable objects. These two amendments will be recommended by the panel to the Finance and Economics Committee, and will be submitted to the plenary meeting of the Yuan after being discussed and passed by the entire committee. As for the draft implementation regulations itself, the panel will continue to review and revise the two initial drafts based on the National Taxation Administration and the committee's experts, so that they can be submitted to the plenary meeting of the committee for discussion.</p>

<p>[Our Taipei Bureau, 3rd] The problem of food smuggling is becoming increasingly serious. Since mid-August, at each small station between Changhua and Chiayi along the railway line, when the military train passes and stops at night, there are more than a hundred thugs, each carrying a cloth bag containing fifty or sixty pounds of rice, holding wooden sticks, and controlling the entrances and exits of the station, placing the rice bags on the military train, leaving more than a dozen people to guard it, and then dispersing after the train leaves. When the military train arrives at Douliu and Dounan stations near Chiayi, there are also more than a hundred thugs, also holding wooden sticks, controlling the entrances and exits of the station, moving the rice bags down and transferring them to Beigang in Tainan County for smuggling out. The total number is about 20,000 pounds each time. These thugs do not buy train tickets and echo each other at the upper and lower stations, which is obviously an organized smuggling group. They speak sharply to the station personnel and military police. Because they are numerous and hold wooden sticks, no one dares to confront them. The Taiwan Garrison Command, the Food Bureau, and the Railway Bureau are consulting on ways to stop it.</p>

<p>Severe Disasters in Qinghai, Provincial Transportation and Economy Disrupted, Provincial Government Requests 5 Million Yuan in Emergency Relief from Central Government</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch from Lanzhou, 3rd] The rain disaster in Qinghai is unprecedented in decades. According to preliminary disaster surveys, more than 2 million trees have been washed away, and 70% of the roadbeds of the Ganqing, Qingxin, and Qingzang national highways have been destroyed. None of the major bridges and culverts have been spared. 90% of the large-scale water conservancy projects under construction in Ping'an, Yingkai, Changsheng, and Gegong have been destroyed. In Xining alone, 44 people drowned. Although the losses of public and private property in other areas are still being investigated, the figures must be enormous. Currently, transportation throughout the province is cut off, people are panicking, and famine is imminent. The Qinghai Provincial Government telegraphed the President and relevant ministries of the central government and the Northwest Military and Administrative Office on the 2nd, requesting an emergency allocation of 5 million gold yuan, with 3 million yuan to repair the roadbeds and bridges of various national highways and quickly restore transportation, and 2 million yuan to provide relief to disaster victims.</p>

<p>Henan Refugee Students in Wuhan Clash with Police, Three Students Shot, Two Missing, Wuhan Police Department of the Huazhong Suppression Headquarters Dispatches Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch from Hankou, 3rd] At 11:00 PM on the 2nd, Henan refugee students in Wuhan clashed with police officers from the 61st Branch Bureau. Three students were shot, and one student went missing. Forty-one Henan refugee students went to the Zhonghui Photo Studio at 10:00 PM last night to claim their expired photos. Because the studio could not provide the photos, a verbal dispute broke out. After the students were wronged, they gathered dozens of people to reason with the studio. At this time, a member of the Protection Corps, Mr. Shi, came forward to protect the photo studio and was taken by the students to their residence. The 6th Branch Bureau learned of this and took two students to the bureau for questioning and shooting, resulting in three students being injured and two missing. Among them, Zhao Zhenjie was shot in the leg and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. Upon hearing the news, Director Ren of the Police Headquarters was furious. In addition to ordering the detention of Chen Ziang, the Director of the 6th Branch Bureau, and five related police officers, he personally went to the hospital to comfort the injured students. The Huazhong Suppression Headquarters and the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters have also dispatched personnel to investigate, and convened the students to speak, advising them to restrain their emotions and await a fair resolution. At the moment, the students' emotions are still calm. In addition to making a written request to punish the perpetrators, treat the injured, and return the missing classmates and guarantee the students' safety, there are no other actions. It is widely believed that this unfortunate incident can be resolved immediately if it is handled reasonably. However, among the more than 3,000 refugee students, only 1,000 have been approved to be placed in temporary positions, and the remaining 2,000 have no food or clothing. It is urgently hoped that the authorities will quickly find a solution to avoid emergencies.</p>

Wang Zhifu, the president of the college, has been impeached for corruption and dereliction of duty by Supervisory Committee members He Younian, Hu Wenhui, and Cai Xiaoyi. The impeachment has been reviewed and established by the Control Yuan and transferred to the Executive Yuan for punishment. In addition to detailing Wang Zhifu's dereliction of duty, the original impeachment document also exposed Wang Wenjun, Director of the Hubei Education Department, for favoritism, assisting Wang Zhifu in deceiving the Ministry of Education and harming students. It also criticized the Ministry of Education for dissolving Hubei Normal College solely on the basis of Wang's one-sided statement.</p>

<p>Agence France-Presse: All Parties Refuse to Support, Schuman Fails to Form Cabinet Again, President Favors Meyer as Prime Minister, General Expectation that Parliament Will Be Dissolved</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] After four days of struggling to form a cabinet, French Prime Minister Schuman finally failed and resigned on the 3rd. Radical Socialist Party member Meyer (Minister of the Armed Forces in the Marie Cabinet), who was reportedly favored by President Auriol, may be the next candidate. Schuman submitted his resignation to Auriol shortly before 2:00 PM. The immediate cause of his failure was that no one was willing to take the position of Minister of Interior at a time when labor strikes were raging and the French Communist Party and the Gaullists were on the verge of confrontation. Schuman initially favored Mitterrand, but Mitterrand's Democratic Socialist Resistance Union demanded that Schuman promise to hold a general election in October, otherwise Mitterrand would refuse to join the cabinet, which Schuman rejected. The Democratic Socialist Resistance Union's proposal could open a way out for de Gaulle. Twenty members of the Independent Republican Party have petitioned the National Assembly to amend the electoral law and dissolve parliament for a new election. When Schuman left the palace, he told the press: "I have said that a strong government is needed to ensure security, but I have not been able to form one." He strongly criticized the "unconditional attitude" of the middle parties, and said: The Socialist Party refused to join the cabinet on the 2nd because Schuman did not agree to the workers' demand for a pay raise, thus the foundation of the Schuman cabinet was overthrown. According to official announcements, Auriol immediately began talks to find a new prime minister. The first person summoned was National Assembly President Herriot. The fact is that Auriol's options are almost exhausted. Only one person has publicly declared that he is willing to take on the difficult task, and that is General de Gaulle, but he has no hope of being ordered to form a cabinet. However, as the situation deteriorates, de Gaulle says he will make a comeback after the re-election.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd] The French cabinet crisis has intensified tonight after Schuman, who was ordered to form a cabinet, reported to President Auriol that he could not form a new cabinet. Observers expect that no one will take over the formation of a new cabinet, and the National Assembly will inevitably be dissolved. If this happens, the strength of each party in the new parliament may undergo major changes. The Gaullists have long demanded a new general election because they believe they can win an overwhelming majority in the new parliament. Political observers here point out that after three candidates in the National Assembly have failed to win confidence, the parliament can be dissolved according to the constitution.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The strike wave continues to spread in France. Miners, dock workers, metallurgical workers, and railway workers, especially workers in northern France, have expressed dissatisfaction with working conditions and demanded wage increases. Unions affiliated with the left-wing French General Confederation of Labor and the anti-communist "Labor Force" have participated in the strike. This morning, workers from the two factions jointly held a half-hour demonstration strike at Arsenale, but the Christian Railway Workers' Union has decided not to participate in the strike. They believe that "the time for a strike is not yet ripe." Currently, most of the strikes in France are short-term demonstrations.</p>

<p>Four-Power Governors Continue Meeting, Berlin Blockade May Be Lifted, Three Major Committees Have Completed Reports</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 2nd] The four-power military commanders in Germany are holding a series of meetings. According to reliable sources, these meetings may lead to the lifting of the Soviet blockade of Berlin on the 5th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 2nd] The four-power resident General Governors in Germany will hold their third meeting at 5:00 PM on the 3rd to discuss the lifting of the Berlin blockade. At the same time, railway workers in the Soviet-occupied zone are seen to be busy. Reliable sources say that the three major committees of the four governors—transportation, finance, and trade—have drafted new reports for the four commanders. It is reported that due to the time required for technical considerations, the crux of the Berlin issue has not yet been discussed. However, the Soviet side's optimism has been expressed by the Soviet district newspapers, while the Western district newspapers are still reserved, as the Western authorities believe that it is not yet time to be optimistic or pessimistic. Other meetings are being held at the same time as the governors' meeting, which may indicate the trend of the talks. The chairman of the Soviet District Railway Executive Committee, Bismouth, has begun to discuss with the inter-district railway executive committee the method of lifting the blockade. It is reported that the railway supplying Berlin "has almost been repaired." According to the Soviet Union's excuse for blockading Berlin for 76 days, it was only repairing the railway. The German side said that as long as the Soviet Union agrees, the train can start to drive to Berlin in a few hours. German political circles have once again applied for the right to speak at the governors' meeting, but they have been ignored by the four powers. A telegram from West Germany stated that two freight cars carrying a total of 8,000 tons of coal are concentrating on the border waiting for orders. As soon as the blockade is lifted, they will drive into Berlin. "Daily Review" and other Soviet newspapers predict that the Western-issued Mark will be abolished in Berlin immediately, and all of Berlin will accept the currency supported by the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>日簽降紀念日對記者宣布</p>
<p>Announced to Reporters on the Anniversary of the Japanese Surrender</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] President Truman declared at a press conference during a weekly reception for news reporters on the third anniversary of the victory over Japan that he firmly believed that the world would soon achieve lasting peace. The US government is still trying to restore this lasting peace, but he cannot explain the reasons for this optimism today. He could not make any criticism of the talks in Moscow. Truman continued in a firm tone, stating that during the war, the Soviet Union was the US's ally, so there were no Russian spies in the United States. What was found were Germans and Japanese. He also stated that the current congressional investigation into the so-called communist conspiracy in the US government is aimed at making the American people pay attention to this issue and not to other issues. He said that the Democratic government protected the Communist Party, which is a declaration. When asked about Dewey's statement that the Republican Party will eliminate the Communist Party from the government once elected, Truman replied: His opposition party is not as willing to eliminate the Communist Party as the Democratic Party. There are very few Communists in the government, and the Democratic Party has already eliminated them itself.</p>

<p>Third Anniversary of the Japanese Surrender, America's View of Japan Has Changed Greatly, America Is Rebuilding Japan to Make It a Fortress in the Far East</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] Today is the third anniversary of Japan's formal surrender on the US battleship Missouri, and the American people's view of Japan has undergone major changes. Most of the trauma has naturally healed over time. Today, very few Americans express hatred for the entire Japanese nation and its people. American businessmen returning from Japan generally praise the Japanese reconstruction work and MacArthur's administration. There is even discussion of investing private American capital in Japan. Behind the scenes, the US official opinion on Japan has also undergone significant changes. This situation is largely due to the tension in US-Soviet relations. The general impression is that US national policy is mainly influenced by strategic considerations, so it is stepping up the reconstruction of Japan as a fortress of the American Far East defense line and as an "Asian factory".</p>

<p>US Secretary of the Army Agrees with MacArthur's Labor Law for Japan, Does Not Conflict with Far Eastern Commission Policy</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] US Secretary of the Army Royal today endorsed the views expressed by General MacArthur in his letter to Japanese Prime Minister Ashida. In the letter, MacArthur considered the strike of public officials to be "unimaginable and intolerable." At the same time, Royal released a statement recently issued by Sebald, the American member of the Allied Council for Japan and the Supreme Commander's representative, accusing certain leaders of the Japanese government's staff groups of attempting to obtain "personal power". Royal said: "The suggestions made in MacArthur's letter, as far as we know, do not prejudice or conflict with any labor policy passed by the Far Eastern Commission, or any instructions issued by the US government." After receiving MacArthur's letter, the Japanese government passed a temporary law, intending to submit to the next session of the Diet a major law on the rights of workers, whether these workers are directly employed by the government or working in Japanese government enterprises.</p>

<p>[Our News] London Radio on the 3rd Czech officials announced on the 3rd: Former Czech President Beneš died of illness at 6:10 PM (Czech time, equivalent to 4:10 PM World Standard Time) at his country residence, at the age of 64. His wife was by his side.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 2nd] According to a probing inquiry on the 2nd: Beneš accepted the communist dictatorship cabinet in February purely to avoid civil war. At the same time, he warned the Communist Party that they would destroy democracy. Absolutely reliable sources said that the first action of the Communist regime was to withhold Beneš's speech to the then Prime Minister Gottwald (now President). The contents of his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>"Not all Czech people want to destroy democracy, but you and the party you lead want to do so. After I sign, it will be tantamount to destroying Czech democracy and betraying a promise, which is contained in 'President Liberator - we will remain loyal'. Not only I, but the entire country has paid too expensive a price. I did this entirely to prevent civil war. You have threatened me with this, and you do have the ability to provoke a war. But I believe that the Czech people understand my actions, and most people will be able to prove the methods you use. For them, it is transplanted from foreign countries, and most people will also be able to prove that you have underestimated the maturity of the Czech people's moral personality, their loyalty, and their efforts towards democracy." Sources said that this passage was removed from the newsreel recording and also deleted from the newspaper.</p>

<p>[United Press New York, 2nd] Former Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister Masaryk's personal physician, Klinger, recently wrote an article for the "Saturday Evening Post" stating that he believed Masaryk's death was not a suicide. Klinger and Masaryk had planned to escape to England by plane on the day of Masaryk's death. Klinger also revealed that three days before his death, Masaryk had sent the American woman he deeply loved and intended to marry out of Czechoslovakia. Masaryk told the woman that he would meet her in London as soon as possible. Klinger had previously told London "Sunday Times" diplomatic correspondent, Burghardt, his personal opinion on Masaryk's suicide. According to Burghardt, a long-time friend of former Czech President Beneš, Jan Masaryk Jr., and Klinger, Burghardt, based on his conversation with Klinger, wrote an explanation of Masaryk's suicide as follows: "Masaryk's plan to escape from Czechoslovakia was discovered by the Czech security police. Therefore, they arrested or killed Masaryk on March 10th of this year. Masaryk first defended himself with a handgun, possibly killing four people. However, Masaryk's handgun had no bullets left for suicide. The remaining security police continued to advance, forcing Masaryk close to the window. Masaryk's death was due to resisting at the time, or being thrown out of the window by them, or refusing to be arrested. Masaryk jumped out of the building out of excessive fear, a reaction, and not of his own volition."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Batavia, 2nd] The rapid leftward shift in the political development within the Republic of Indonesia has stunned neutral observers here. Personnel from the British and American consulates general have contacted important figures in the Republic of Indonesia, requesting them to provide information regarding the merger of the Indonesian Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The Dutch Attorney General has also requested a complete list of all socialist party members residing in Dutch-controlled territory. At the same time, Chinese observers are deeply concerned that the future of overseas Chinese residing in the territory of the Indonesian Republican Party will become even more precarious. The number of overseas Chinese who have recently escaped to Dutch-controlled areas through bribery is increasing daily. It is understood that more than 3,000 overseas Chinese have registered with the Chinese General Association in Yogyakarta, all expressing their willingness to move to what they call "peaceful areas." All those residing within the territory of the Indonesian Republican Party feel that the further their residence is from Yogyakarta, the less safe they are.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Wang Da Zhonghua Private Black Market Gold and Currency Exchange Case Announced: Wang Chunzhe Sentenced to Death; Zhang Yansheng Sentenced to Five Years; Lin Tongshi and Zheng Ligong Acquitted; Investigation of Sanwei Still Pending <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The case of Lin Wang, Da Zhonghua, and Sanwei three companies, which once caused a sensation for disrupting the financial market through private black market gold, currency, and exchange dealings, has reached a verdict. After the principal offenders, Wang Chunzhe, Zhang Yansheng, Huang Yuanjue, etc., were arrested by the police and, along with the evidence, transferred to the Special Criminal Court of this city, the case was investigated, prosecuted, and publicly tried several times. Among them, apart from the Sanwei company, which is still awaiting investigation of evidence, the remaining two companies have been concluded. The sentence was announced yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Wang Chunzhe of Lin Wang Company was found guilty of "jointly intending to disrupt the financial market to hinder the suppression of rebellion" and sentenced to death. Lin Tongshi and Zheng Ligong were acquitted. Zhang Yansheng of Da Zhonghua Company was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for private exchange dealings. It is reported that this case should be sent to the Central Special Criminal Court for review before it can be executed.</p>
<p>The court's reasoning for the judgment was that Wang Chunzhe of Lin Wang Company deliberately violated government laws and engaged in large-scale black market trading of gold, U.S. dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, and used telegrams to conduct various foreign exchange transactions. To avoid government inspection, he prepared separate accounts and used code names for trading communications. The trading areas extended as far as New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, and Shantou. From December of the 36th year to March/April of the 37th year, the amount of gold, U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and private foreign exchange he traded was staggering, enough to affect the national economy and cause social unrest. This was by no means comparable to ordinary merchants seeking petty profits, nor could it be achieved with the financial resources of one or two individuals alone. It was clearly a secretly organized attempt to hinder the suppression of rebellion, so the death penalty was imposed to serve as a stern warning. As for the accomplice Zheng Jiayu, a separate warrant has been issued for his arrest. Lin Tongshi and Zheng Ligong could not be proven to have committed the crime, so they were acquitted. Also, Zhang Yansheng of Da Zhonghua Company's private Hong Kong exchange business started in May of the 36th year, but at that time, the Central Bank's foreign exchange control regulations did not have explicit provisions for punishing private foreign exchange operations, so it should not be considered a crime. Only the exchange dealings in February/March of the 37th year should be punished. The punishment is different from that of Lin Wang Company, so he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Managing Authorities Launch Startling Action: Seven Major Merchants Including Rong Hongyuan Detained; Heads of Oil and Rice Industries and Wing On Textile Factory Warned <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Since the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Order, the general response in this city has been good, but some merchants still have a wait-and-see attitude, hoarding goods for speculation. Even more, some people dare to violate the law and continue to operate black market gold, currency, foreign exchange, and over-the-counter stock transactions. The Shanghai District Economic Supervision Office has been paying close attention to this. The office formally established an inspection committee the day before yesterday and began to take startling action with an iron fist, giving these people a severe blow. As of yesterday, those arrested included Rong Hongyuan, general manager of New Textile General Company; Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Paper Industry Association; Huang Yicong, manager of Yongtaihe Tobacco Company; Wu Xilin, manager of Wu Xiji Cotton Cloth Store; Wei Boxiang, a major black market gold and currency dealer; Du Weiping, a broker at the stock exchange; and Lin Legeng, a stockbroker. Those who were summoned and warned included Guo Dihuo, deputy manager of Wing On Textile Factory; Zhang Chao, chairman of the Oil Industry Association; and Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Industry Association.</p>
<p>The Economic Supervision Office held its first press conference at 11:00 AM yesterday morning on the third floor of the Central Bank. Secretary Gao Lijiao announced this startling news, stating that some unscrupulous merchants are currently hoarding large quantities of daily necessities and refusing to sell them, especially cotton yarn, paper, and cigarettes, which are most lacking in the market. Based on reports and confidential information from various sources, the Supervision Office, after detailed investigation, discovered that (1) Wing On and Shenxin textile factories have the largest amount of cotton yarn stockpiled in their warehouses, which they have not released to the market. Guo Dihuo, deputy general manager of Wing On, and Rong Hongyuan, general manager of Shenxin, were summoned the day before yesterday. Rong had previously been summoned for a private Hong Kong exchange case and released on bail. He had left Shanghai for Hong Kong, so his guarantor, Rong Yixin, was brought in. They were given severe warnings and ordered to sell the stockpiled yarn. Guo Dihuo and Rong Yixin both expressed their willingness to comply and were released on bail. (According to the latest news, Rong Hongyuan returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday and has been arrested by the police. See separate article for details.) (2) Oil and rice prices have risen sharply recently, and there is also hoarding and speculation. Zhang Chao, chairman of the Oil Industry Association, and Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, were summoned. Zhang signed a guarantee to sell. Chiang, the Supervisor, gave Wan Molin a severe warning, instructing him that he must be responsible for the rice market, that the rice price must not be higher than the market price on August 19, and that he must not use the excuse of having no rice to sell, or he would be arrested. Wan repeatedly assented and withdrew.</p>

<p>(3) Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Paper Industry Association, was arrested, and more than 3,000 pieces of various types of paper were seized in the warehouses at his locations on Guangdong Road and Sijing Road. Zhan did not deny the hoarding point at the police station and was detained. Huang Yicong, general manager of Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, is suspected of manipulating the city's cigarette prices and hoarding large quantities of cigarettes. On the 2nd, more than 13,000 boxes of stockpiled cigarettes were seized from Yongtaihe's DGHN four warehouses at No. 107 to 112 Huangpu Road. Huang was arrested at his residence at No. 11, Lane 147, Beijing West Road, and detained after interrogation. Wu Xilin, the person in charge of Wu Xiji Cotton Cloth Store, is a tycoon in the city's cotton cloth industry and is suspected of hoarding a large amount of cotton cloth. He was also arrested and detained after interrogation on the afternoon of the 2nd. Zhan, Huang, and Wu will all be transferred to the Special Criminal Court within days to be severely dealt with according to the law. (4) Wei Boxiang, a black market gold and currency dealer, continued to operate large-scale black market gold and currency trading after the currency reform and was also arrested. (5) Securities brokers Du Weiping and Lin Legeng were arrested for operating over-the-counter transactions after the stock market was closed, and their licenses were revoked.</p>
<p>Stockpiled Goods Confiscated or Purchased</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned arrested persons will be sent to the judicial authorities by the police for strict handling. Their stockpiled goods will be confiscated or purchased by the government. Gao continued: The Economic Supervision Office is cracking down on these illegal elements to maintain normal market conditions. Therefore, legitimate merchants will be protected as much as possible, but there is no benefit in hoarding and waiting, because our policy will be absolutely enforced to the end.</p>
<p>Chiang Ching-kuo, at the invitation of reporters, attended a two-minute talk at the end of the reception. He hoped that merchants would not have a wait-and-see attitude, and said that the control policy is a complete control from production to consumption, including the source of goods in the producing area. Regarding cotton yarn, he is determined to order private yarn factories to sell directly to production enterprises, so as not to fall into the hands of brokers for hoarding. When a reporter asked whether the case of a certain tycoon dumping Yong On shares on the eve of August 19 had been found out, Chiang said that the entire case would be clear within one or two days and would be announced.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the City Government and the Economic Control Supervisor's Office yesterday regarding Zhan Peilin's being summoned for questioning, requesting that he be released on bail pending a thorough investigation in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] It is confirmed that Qi Zaiyu, the former captain of the Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters, was sentenced to death by the military law office of the headquarters for corruption and dereliction of duty, and the sentence has been approved by the Ministry of National Defense. Zhang Yamin, the chief of the Economic Section of the Inspection Office of the headquarters, was sentenced to death by the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense for taking advantage of his position to speculate and engage in corruption.

<h3 id="e64">Suspected of Private Hong Kong Exchange Dealings: Rong Hongyuan Sheds Tears at the Police Station; Detained Immediately After Returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] According to sources: The reason for the arrest of Rong Hongyuan, general manager of Shenxin Textile General Company, this time is not for hoarding yarn and refusing to sell it, but for private dealings in a large amount of Hong Kong exchange. It is reported that after Rong learned of the crimes he had committed from the authorities at the police station yesterday, he felt that the case was serious and shed tears, lowering his head and remaining silent. Before arresting Rong, the authorities had thoroughly investigated all the evidence of Rong's private Hong Kong exchange dealings, so after Rong was taken to the police station yesterday, he was detained after a brief interrogation.</p>
<p>In addition, the process of arresting Rong Hongyuan by the police squad of the City Police Bureau was also somewhat tortuous. The police squad was ordered to arrest Rong some days ago, but when they arrived at the Shenxin General Company, Rong Hongyuan had left for Hong Kong and had not returned. They summoned Rong Yixin, manager of Shenxin Third Factory, to the police station for questioning and released him on bail pending further investigation. Later, the police squad learned that Rong had returned to Shanghai yesterday, so they went to the company again at 11:00 AM to summon him. Rong went to the police station with the police squad members after having a meal.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the Zhenru District checkpoint of the managing authorities intercepted a truck, Nanhu Transportation Company No. 03-3563, carrying 20 pieces of cotton from Taifeng Yarn Factory to Taicang.

They immediately took the truck back to Shanghai, and the goods were temporarily sealed and stored in the Four Banks Warehouse. The person involved, Yan Yunshao, was taken to the police station for questioning. Also, the checkpoint intercepted a truck smuggling three large barrels of diesel oil out of the city at the same location yesterday afternoon and detained it pending instructions. It was found that the goods belonged to the Innovation Leather Factory in this city and are now under interrogation.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Third Factory of Xinyu Yarn Factory at No. 30 Changshou Road, Huxi, employs more than 2,000 male and female workers and has an industrial labor union. Since the spring of this year, Wu Huixian, the chairman of the labor union, has gone into hiding due to his alleged membership of the communist party, and the union's affairs have almost come to a standstill. Currently, the union has been ordered by the Bureau of Social Affairs to assign instructors to conduct a re-election. However, the entire female workforce opposed this and went on strike unanimously at 9:30 PM on the 1st, and clashed with the re-election preparatory committee designated by the Bureau of Social Affairs and some of the male workers, resulting in a brawl and a tense situation. Fortunately, Shen Deheng, director of the Putuo Road Police Sub-bureau, Deputy Director Huang Chaobin, and Zhu Dingkun, chief of the judicial section, personally led the entire police force of the political group and dispatched riot police to suppress the situation. After many persuasions, the entire workforce resumed work at 3:30 AM the next morning.

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a discussion meeting with leaders of various industrial trade associations in this city at the Chamber of Commerce. Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo encouraged all industries to strictly comply with the August 19th price limits to overcome the current economic difficulties. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Those in attendance included Du Yuesheng, Xu , Liu Hongsheng, Wu Yun Chu, Luo Xuelian, and more than 300 representatives from various industrial trade associations. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau delivered a speech to introduce the purpose of the meeting, stating: "In order for the currency reform to be successful, it requires national support and thorough implementation. Today, we have convened representatives from various industrial trade associations in this city to exchange ideas with Supervisor Jiang and discuss how to implement the central government's economic reform plan. I hope everyone will express their opinions as much as possible."</p>
<p>Enduring Minor Sacrifices is Not Without Value</p>
<p>Jiang Jingguo then delivered a speech, stating: "China has suffered through eight years of the War of Resistance and three years of the War of Rebellion. Now, the country is in a state of turmoil, and the people are living in poverty. The economy has reached a point where reform is inevitable. Therefore, this currency reform is a matter of life and death for the nation. It can only succeed and cannot fail. If the currency reform succeeds, China still has hope for revival. If it fails, everyone will perish together. Now, I hope everyone will support the currency reform policy. The most important point is to strictly comply with the August 19th price limits for buying and selling and not arbitrarily increase prices. In the past, prices were rising like a flood. If we do not build a dike to prevent it, everything will be submerged. Therefore, the August 19th price limit policy is to prevent flooding. Afterwards, we will find ways to dredge the floodwaters and bring the floating capital back to the right track. What China needs most now is stability. To achieve order and stability, we must first create a stable environment. Suppressing prices is a way to stabilize the environment. Under the August 19th price limits, everyone may have to endure some sacrifices. Individual losses are for the survival of the public so that everyone has food to eat. This kind of sacrifice is not without value."</p>
<p>As Long as You Can Obey the Law, We Don't Want to Cause More Trouble</p>
<p>"I also know that the August 19th price limits are not a perfect solution. However, it is still an emergency measure for today. I know that many people in Shanghai are annoyed, but I always adhere to legality, reason, and rationality in my work. As long as everyone can abide by the government's laws and not act one way in public and another in private, I don't want to cause more trouble. In China today, if we continue to be perfunctory and unwilling to earnestly implement policies, then all good policies will not be realized. As for the difficulties of various factories, the government will find ways to solve them and absolutely does not want to see factories close down. Regarding the issue of raw materials, there is a separate Material Adjustment Committee to handle it. I hope that various industrial groups in this city will strictly comply with regulations, assist the government, and also help themselves. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and its every move has a great impact on the whole country. If it can take the lead in suppressing prices, it will surely become a model for all parts of the country. If you have any difficulties, please express your opinions as much as possible." Representatives from the canvas industry, shipbuilding industry, needle manufacturing industry, textile supplies industry, enamelware industry, rubber industry, paper industry, steel refining industry, printing industry, underwear industry, wool textile industry, and other industries stated the difficulties of their respective industries. The main points were: (1) Difficulties in obtaining raw materials. The factory's finished products are wholesaled and sold according to the price limit, but raw materials cannot be replenished. (2) They hope that the government will not increase tax rates, lest it be suspected of leading price increases.</p>
<p>Everyone is Unwilling to Report; Complaining is Useless</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. Jiang replied: "After hearing everyone's opinions, I know that there are so many problems with prices in Shanghai. Just now I said that controlling prices is divided into (1) preventing flooding and (2) dredging two types. Price limits, checking warehouses, etc., are all methods to prevent flooding. Subsidies will be used. The focus of future work is still on dredging, that is, the Material Adjustment Committee will be used to ensure that the supply and demand of production industries are not in short supply. If raw cotton and yarn materials are needed, you can make an application to the Material Adjustment Committee, and the Cotton and Yarn Association will sell the yarn directly to the yarn factories. In addition, the raw cotton and yarn materials hoarded in the warehouses will be confiscated and auctioned. There will definitely be no problem with the raw materials for the yarn factories. The printing industry stated that it is difficult to find white printing paper. Why is it that no one reports the paper merchants who hoard white printing paper? This time, the paper merchant Zhan Peilin was detained, and it was found that the merchant was hoarding a large amount of white printing paper, some of which had been hoarded since after the victory of the war. Everyone is unwilling to come forward to report and only knows how to complain about the lack of raw materials, which is useless. As long as you know where there are hoarded goods and raw materials, I will find a way to investigate them for you to use. I hope everyone can disregard personal relationships and report hoarding and price-gouging merchants, and protect and support legitimate industries and businesses, so that under legal, reasonable, and rational methods, the city's industries and businesses can develop and prosper day by day."</p>
<h3 id="e84">House Tax and Municipal Construction Surtax: Formulation of Collection Methods; Mayor Submits to the Seventh Plenary Session of the City Council for Decision <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The seventh plenary session of the first Municipal Council is approaching. Yesterday, the council received a proposal from the mayor and a proposal from Councilor Zhang Yiqu. The mayor's proposal stated: The original collection methods for the city's house tax and municipal construction surtax are no longer applicable since the currency reform. There is a need to re-formulate them. Therefore, in accordance with Article 185 of the Land Law, the House Tax Ordinance, and Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Collection of House Tax in this city passed by the Municipal Council, the total value of houses, which has been re-estimated, will still be used as the base for tax collection, as in the past, with 10% of the value serving as the surtax base. As for the surtax rate, in order to reduce the burden on all citizens, the original surtax rate determined by the Municipal Council will still be levied without any changes.</p>
<p>The municipal construction surtax, which was originally passed by the Municipal Council, was also based on the aforementioned house tax base and used a progressive calculation method, divided into five grades: A, B, C, D, and E, with additional percentages of 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. With the currency reform, these percentages have naturally disappeared. However, in order to comply with the Municipal Council's resolution, the progressive calculation method will still be adopted, and taxes will be levied according to rates for each grade to ensure fairness and equalize the tax burden. Method: 1. The house tax will be based on the re-estimated total value of the houses, with 10% of the value still being used as the surtax base, as in the past. The tax rate for commercial houses will be 10%, and the tax rate for residential houses will be 5%. 2. The municipal construction surtax will adopt a progressive calculation method, with the aforementioned house tax base serving as the surtax base. The grades and tax rates are shown in the following table: Grade E, 1-300 yuan, tax rate of 6%; Grade D, 301-500 yuan, 8%; Grade C, 501-700 yuan, 10%; Grade B, 701-900 yuan, 12%; Grade A, 901 yuan and above, 14%. The mayor believed that the case urgently needed to be implemented, so yesterday, he specially prepared a document along with the revised articles of the collection rules and submitted them to the Municipal Council for decision.</p>
<p>Pre-War Metallic Subsidiary Coins: Zhang Yiqu Proposes Permission for Circulation</p>
<p>Zhang Yiqu proposed: In order to establish the people's basic confidence in the currency reform, the central government should be immediately advised to temporarily allow the public to use various old metallic subsidiary coins from the pre-war period before the various metallic subsidiary coins are completely minted. Method: Refer to the legal ratio between the old silver dollars and the gold yuan coupons, and stipulate the following: Old silver coins and old nickel coins worth one dime should each be allowed to be equivalent to two dimes of gold yuan coupons; those worth two dimes should each be allowed to be equivalent to four dimes of gold yuan coupons. Old copper coins worth ten cash should also be allowed to be used at one fen.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Hu Shi Discusses News Work: Historical Research and Reporting Missions <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Hu Shi, president of Peiping University, was invited to attend the Peiping City Journalist Day celebrations. Drawing on his personal experience as a historical researcher, he elaborated on the difficulties of news work and encouraged everyone with the four words "Diligent, Careful, Harmonious, and Slow." This newspaper has already published a special dispatch from Peiping on the 1st, but it was not detailed enough. Here is an excerpt of the main points of the full text (recorded by the Central News Agency):</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Considers Himself a Journalist</p>
<p>When Mr. Hu spoke, he showed his commemorative badge as an honorary member of the American Journalism Fraternity (Sigma deltwchi), which he was invited to join in the United States in 1941, considering himself a journalist. He said, "I am engaged in historical research, which is also a record of reporting work. I also occasionally write some current affairs commentaries. I hope to be included in the journalist group." He then spoke in a humorous and moving tone about his understanding of news work, saying: He was engaged in the textual research of "Shui Jing Zhu" by chance, hoping to complete three "s"s, but from three months to half a year, one year, and now five years, the reference books have been piled up and completed, but he still does not dare to draw conclusions. This "Shui Jing Zhu" of 150 years ago has been studied by Wang Guowei, Meng Sen, Liu Qi, and other scholars. They have different opinions on Dai Dongyuan and Zhao Yiqing, the authors of two books that are 90% identical. I found that they all got angry, so they could not calmly complete the textual research. From this, we can know the difficulty of textual research of a fact, that is, the difficulty of news work reporting the truth. However, doing historical textual research and news reporting are the same. We must strive for truth. Mr. Hu then cited the Xi'an Incident and the 75 Incident as examples, saying: "I have not heard two people describe any event with the same content," and quoted Huxley's famous saying: "Saying what I believe to be true" is a prudent task. When "I cannot believe it to be true," I must carefully draw conclusions, because the words of news reporters are the materials for future historians.</p>
<p>Zhu Xi's Famous Saying</p>
<p>Mr. Hu also quoted the famous saying of Neo-Confucian master Zhu Xi: "Diligent, Careful, Harmonious, and Slow" to encourage news reporters, saying: "This is collected by Zhu Fuzi in a story about Liu Qi's jinshi in elementary school. I myself use these four words to conduct myself in the world." Mr. Hu explained these four words, saying: "Diligence is not being lazy, and carefulness is not being sloppy. Even the slightest word is not let go. These two points are the necessary conditions for a reporter. Without this, it is not enough to succeed. Harmony is being calm and peaceful. If a reporter cannot eliminate prejudices, the record will be biased, and it is easy to ruin a person. For example, the story of the lost axe in 'Liezi' is an example. News reporting must abandon political prejudices and partisan views."</p>
<p>Collect Facts from Multiple Sources</p>
<p>"Slow, reporters demand the opposite, but I think it is better to collect more facts and send them to the editorial department a few minutes later than to be hasty in a rush, because reporters can create life or kill people with their pens. I read a book commemorating the 100th anniversary of the United Press the other day, and I deeply admired their development of mechanical and telecommunications applications. I am not opposed to striving for speed in transmission, but I am opposed to the speed of writing manuscripts. You need to seek facts from multiple sources. Although it is slower than others, it is true and accurate." Mr. Hu then described the slow situation of his textual research on the book "Xingshi Yinyuan," saying: "This book is a first-class masterpiece, but the author is a pseudonym. When Dongya Bookstore reprinted it, after hitting the paper plate, they asked me to write a preface. I asked them to wait until the author was identified. At that time, I had assumed that it was Pu Songling, the author of 'Liaozhai,' but I did not dare to write it down. Five years later, I found some information to prove that it was Pu Gong and wrote a 50,000-word long preface before the book was published. Therefore, when news must be sent out, if the evidence is insufficient, it is better to suspend it." Mr. Hu concluded, "I hope to be a little slower within the scope of possibility and show mercy."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 2nd] Although the sudden death case of Shen Pang Guiying, a woman from Huangdu Township, Qingpu, has been inspected twice, it has been said that she died by hanging herself. After the Second District Supervision Group came to Qingpu to find out, they immediately detained Luo, the squad leader of the Self-Defense Standing Team, and Wang, an employee, who had restricted Shen's freedom. They also sent a letter to the Suzhou Higher Procuratorate to specially send forensic doctor Xuan Fang to Qingpu to open the coffin for re-examination. After the forensic doctor Xuan returned to Suzhou, it is now reported: The result of the Shen woman's bone steaming shows that there were injuries on her neck, waist, abdomen, and ribs, and there were traces of seminal fluid on her genitals. It was determined that she was forced to have sexual intercourse before her death. Due to shame, she committed suicide by hanging herself. The judge Liao who handled the case has been dismissed, the examiner is missing, and the inspection clerk Chen Guangchong has suddenly resigned. The case is clear, the grievance can be redressed, and the perpetrators should be punished according to law.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper, Jurong, 1st] Recently, a situation of demanding tolls has occurred on the Zhenjiang-Jurong Highway. Between Longgang and Qilidian, the road surface is being repaired. A certain engineering office places a road roller in the middle of the road, while the side of the road is piled with gravel on the right and a muddy area on the left. Generally, when transporting rice seedlings, cars often get stuck in the mud when passing through this section of the road in a single line. If you want to ask the road repair engineering office to tow it with their ten-wheel truck, you need to ask for five gallons of gasoline, or at least four gallons of gasoline as the price.</p>

<p>[Report from our Hefei Office on the 2nd] The local court here recently received an order to investigate a case from ten years ago where individuals were labeled as traitors and immediately executed, which is now being reinvestigated. In the winter of the 26th year, Yang Xiaochun, Li Weitang, Wu Zhongying, and Wu Zhongliu were arrested in Liujiafan, Hefei, on the grounds of being traitors. At the time, many important central figures sent telegrams to prove that they were definitely not traitors, but they had already been executed in Fei. Friends of the four felt that they must be vindicated and published a notice in Hankou in the 27th year to clear their names, held a memorial service in Chongqing, and requested the central government to grant compensation. After the victory, several important government officials again submitted requests to reinvestigate the case. With the approval of the highest authorities, the case was handed over to the Judicial Administration Department for thorough investigation, which in turn transferred it to the Anhui High Prosecutor's Office, who delivered it to the Hefei District Court for investigation. After receiving the order, the District Court summoned a Mr. Song, who was ordered to carry out the arrest at the time. The investigation is ongoing, and it is rumored that many people are involved in this case, including prominent figures.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Power of the New Currency in Hong Kong <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this newspaper, Zi Jian</p>
<p>[Airmail from our Hong Kong Office on the 31st] Amidst a generally sluggish business environment in Hong Kong, and in the wake of the first joint price reduction effort by the four major department stores, the birth of the new currency system is indeed a welcome sign, bringing fervent hope to those who were nearly despondent.</p>
<p>Over the past week, the nickname "wet firewood"—referring to the legal tender—has vanished from people's lips. Some no longer need to rush to Hong Kong just to avoid using "wet firewood." Those who used to bring customs gold units to Hong Kong to exchange for Hong Kong dollars are now eagerly taking Hong Kong dollars back to Guangzhou. The success of the Central Bank of Guangzhou in redeeming Hong Kong dollars (which has reached over 10 million) in these few days suggests the vigorousness of this trend.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the National Bank and Postal Remittance Bureau in Hong Kong are also doing good business. The remittance departments, which are usually "as deserted as a bird's nest," have recently become bustling with overseas Chinese sending money back home. This reporter personally went to the Postal Remittance Bureau to investigate and found that the amount of remittances to some cities, such as Xiamen, Shantou, and Ningbo, has exceeded what the local Postal Remittance Bureaus can pay out. Forced by the situation, the bureau announced "full quota reached" and advised remitters to find a solution at the National Bank. This is a rare positive phenomenon after the war. Only today is the actual utility of "absorbing overseas remittances" first being realized.</p>
<p>Comparing domestic rice prices with Hong Kong rice prices (60 or 70 dollars per picul), the former is only one-third of the latter. Ordinary Hong Kong citizens are now commonly talking about, "The cost of food in Guangzhou is only a little more than ten gold yuan per month. Let's go back to make a living." According to the Hong Kong government's Labour Department report, which is as low as it can be, the cost of living for a worker in Hong Kong is over 40 dollars per month. The difference between these two figures will be the determining factor for the increase or decrease of Hong Kong's population in the future.</p>
<p>The emergence of the new currency system has indeed initiated a new turning point for Hong Kong. Although some people still hold onto outdated observations and doubts, they also have no choice but to take off their tinted glasses and face reality.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Hong Kong Island Seizes Smuggling Boat - All Confiscated Goods Become Public Property <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 1st] Yesterday (the 31st) at midnight, the Hong Kong government seized an American-made torpedo boat fully loaded with smuggled goods off the southwest coast of Hong Kong. The boat also had weapons such as machine guns, rifles, and pistols. The boat, which was sixty feet long, was fully loaded with the following smuggled goods: forty-seven cases of cigarettes, seven barrels of gasoline, two hundred and sixty cases of kerosene, and two hundred bags of sugar. All of these goods have been confiscated by the Customs Department. The boat was originally docked near a rarely visited pier in the southwest corner of the island, and it was seized by a customs patrol boat at midnight as it was preparing to set sail. Although the boat was equipped with weapons, they were not used for resistance. The boat has a speed of over 30 knots per hour, and it is believed to be regularly engaged in smuggling between Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou. Because of its high speed, Chinese customs and Hong Kong government patrol boats are often unable to catch up with it. Therefore, this is the first time that a smuggling boat with such a high speed has been seized.</p>

<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures, a comprehensive control of prices has been implemented. For more than ten days, there have been good results. However, due to the conversion of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, the market is flooded with idle capital, and price fluctuations are concerning. According to Mr. Jiang Jingguo, Economic Supervisor, to the Joint Credit Reporting Agency yesterday morning, the Executive Yuan is studying ways to divert idle capital. By controlling prices on the one hand and diverting idle capital on the other, the economy can be stabilized. The best ways to divert idle capital are to sell materials, sell state-owned enterprises and enemy and puppet industries, and issue public bonds. Currently, the government has several measures to coordinate the control. The sale of materials has already begun. State-owned enterprises can be sold. As for the issuance of public bonds, a method will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Also, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's China Textile Construction Company will hold its third first temporary joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 PM this afternoon (the 4th) to discuss matters such as the company's issuance of shares. Chairman Chen Qitian will personally come to Shanghai to preside over the meeting. It is reported that the shares of Textile Construction Company are scheduled to be issued on the 10th of this month. The denominations of the shares are 100 gold yuan per share, divided into five types: one share, ten shares, fifty shares, one hundred shares, and one thousand shares. More than ten printing companies are rushing to print them, and the portions to be paid must be delivered to the Gold Yuan Fund Supervision Committee before the 8th of this month before issuance procedures can be processed.</p>
<p>Also, according to an authoritative person recently responsible for estimating the assets of Textile Construction, the total value of all assets of Textile Construction in the country is approximately 1.2 billion gold yuan, accounting for six-tenths of the total amount of gold yuan issued. Other state-owned enterprises such as China Merchants Bureau will also be sold successively. Therefore, the preparation of the gold yuan issuance fund is very sufficient.</p>

<p>The rice market has reached the price limit. Because prices at the origin are firm and shipments are very scarce, the supply is not large. High-quality rice has disappeared due to the price limit, and medium-quality goods are sold as high-quality goods. Economic police are monitoring transactions. Some dealers simply do not trade. Rice shops are selling very well. Because household rice has not been released for sale, retail sales are very active. Bo Dao is 21.6 yuan and Te Gao Geng is 22.6 yuan, both reaching the price limit. Yesterday's arrivals at the North and South markets were 2990 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Saw a further increase, once reaching the limit. Because the price of raw materials is high, factories have not opened for days and are also absorbing old bank orders. In addition, prices in other ports have risen, and everyone is bullish. Lao Che and Bing Chuan immediately reached the price limit upon opening. The market slightly weakened upon closing due to reports that the delivery period would not be extended. Lao Che rose by five cents, Bing Chuan rose by one corner and four cents, Jian Cheng rose by two corners, and the rest rose by one corner and five cents. Wheat bran rose to the limit.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Transactions were slightly active at the price limit, but there were not many transactions. The supply was scarce, and arrivals were few. Hankou Zha Dou had some transactions with supplies from the street. Corn, from the Yantai gang, had the most transactions, and the price was stable. Yuan Mai had few transactions, and the price was fixed. Red Sorghum opened at the original price of nine yuan. Broad beans and tea beans were all retail transactions. Seventy packages of sesame seeds were offered and were purchased by the street at the price limit, two packages per household. Guangbang raw peanuts had nearly half a package of transactions.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Increased and has reached the limit. Because there is no supply of raw materials such as soybeans to purchase, oil factories have not opened, and its price was originally lower, actual sales were seen to be low. Soybean oil roughly reached the price limit of 52 yuan, and raw vegetable oil was 47 yuan, each rising by 2.5 yuan. Thirty barrels of Jiton raw oil were opened at the limit, and Jiton Xiao Che did not open. Old barrel Xiao Che sesame oil was 52.5 yuan, with three barrels of transactions.

<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to recent reports from the tea industry, the prices of Chinese tea abroad are gradually rising, and the future looks promising. The reason is that the Chinese government is preventing exporters from undercutting prices and harming the long-standing reputation of Chinese tea internationally. At the same time, in order to earn more foreign exchange, there are regulations on the prices of various grades. For example, this year's Tunxi Zhenmei, according to the export price limit, CIF must be at least 30 cents per pound in US dollars. This year's Qimen black tea and Ping Shui green tea have a minimum of 20 cents per pound. Judging from this situation, the export tea has shown improvement.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market was still strong due to the high production costs, the selling price of merchants rose with an upward trend, and the market was unusually excited. However, transactions were still sporadic due to resistance during negotiations. As for the domestic tea, there was a mutual balance, and the market remained the same.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Association of Inland Yarn Factories' Representatives recently stated that the upcoming allocation of US aid cotton, based on the eight allocation principles, favors yarn factories on the coastal ports, while other regions inevitably feel dry. They made five points to the US Aid Utilization Committee and the US Economic Cooperation Administration.</p>
<p>Recently, the Association made 13 more recommendations: (1) US cotton delivery should give all factories equal opportunities and increase the number of delivery ports as much as possible. In addition to Shanghai, add Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and other ports. (2) Yarn factories in non-delivery ports shall pick up cotton from the designated ports themselves, and all freight shall be borne by the delivery agency, so as to be fair. (3) Export yarn and cloth should be designated to be supplied by factories in and near the ports, and domestic yarn and cloth should be designated to be supplied by factories further away from the ports. This can avoid unnecessary transportation and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. The representative has submitted the above opinions in writing to all relevant parties, requesting them to be considered.</p>

<p>Private yarn factories have a very rich inventory of yarn. The Office of the Economic Supervisor of the Executive Yuan decided to order all private yarn factories to sell as much as possible. Regarding the selling price, Mr. Jiang Jingguo specially discussed the principles with Director Lin Chongyong of the Gold Management Bureau, etc., and it was still to be sold by private manufacturers, limited to selling directly to end users, so as to avoid middlemen raising prices and hoarding, and the price was lower than the market price, ordering each private factory to comply. Regarding the control of cotton yarn, Supervisor Jiang said that it was extremely thorough, and raw materials, production, transportation, consumption, and exports must all be controlled.</p>
<p>Also, the Cotton Spinning Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, in order to support the government's intentions and cooperate with economic policies, private yarn factories will hold a temporary joint yarn allocation in the Cotton Weaving Association from the 4th of this month. According to the limit price, 20-count cotton yarn will be sold on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, temporarily targeting dye, knitting, underwear, towel, bed sheet, sail, ribbon, and handkerchief trade associations. The chairmen of each association have been sent an invitation to the Cotton Spinning Association this morning at 11:00 to discuss allocation matters. However, each yarn factory stated that the current limit price is far from enough to cover the costs, and they have repeatedly stated the actual situation to the authorities, requesting the authorities to consider and approve a reasonable price so that the business can continue to be maintained and both national and people's livelihood will benefit.</p>
<p>Also, it is known that on the previous two days, private yarn factories reported to the Association that they had sold cotton yarn and cloth, totaling 813 pieces of various types of cotton yarn converted to 20 counts, and 13,145 pieces of cotton cloth.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Color Film of the World Games Completed <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 3rd] The British-produced color film documentary of the World Games has now been fully completed within three weeks of the Games' closing. By the end of next week, copies in sixteen different languages will be airlifted to countries around the world for screening. The film is titled "The 14th World Games—Glory of Sport," produced by Knights for the Rank Organisation. Knights is also the producer of the documentaries of the Victory Parade and the Princess's wedding. The World Games film is the longest documentary ever made, requiring more than two hours to screen. The entire film is a moving record of extraordinary achievements in sports, capturing the tense and beautiful moments of all aspects of this year's Games. The film begins with several scenes shot in Greece, then transitions to the Winter World Games in Switzerland, lasting about forty minutes. This is followed by the opening ceremony at the Wembley Stadium, after which the camera captures the competition of male and female athletes in various sports activities and swimming events, lasting about an hour. The camera then moves from Wembley to Torquay to film the yachting competitions, and then to other locations to capture rowing competitions, cycling competitions, and equestrian competitions. Another highlight of the film is the marathon, with almost the entire race captured.</p>
<p>The total cost of filming was approximately £250,000, using 400,000 feet of film. Since the end of the competition program, various experts have been working day and night on editing, with the aim of distributing it to all parts of the world within the scheduled time.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Reflections on the World Games Basketball Tournament: Li Zhenzhong Discusses the Successes and Failures of Our Team <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhenzhong, the captain of our World Games basketball team, spoke to a reporter from the Guoguang News Agency yesterday about the general situation of our team's performance in Britain, stating: The strength of the various European countries was overestimated beforehand. Countries such as France, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Hungary, and Italy were all exceptionally fierce. France's runner-up finish, although somewhat fortunate, also demonstrated its strong fighting spirit. Hungary's ability to defeat the second-seeded team, Canada, was particularly remarkable. Our team's defeat to Italy was primarily due to a loss of morale, but Italy had defeated Egypt, and Egypt had defeated our country in a friendly match, so Italy's victory was not an upset. Of the 23 countries participating, approximately 14 were beyond our team's reach. Therefore, in reality, we should be ranked 15th. As for the defeat to the Philippines, Da Li (presumably referring to Li Shiqiao) suggested the following lineup before the game:</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao Li Zhenzhong</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua Huang Tianxi</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang Bao Songyuan</p>
<p>The Philippine players were generally not very tall, and international rules favor taller players, hence the suggestion. Qian Xucang seemed to agree at the time. It is a pity that it was not adopted by the team leader and coach, which is regrettable. Otherwise, even if it could not have turned the tide, we might not have fallen so far behind and suffered such a crushing defeat.</p>
