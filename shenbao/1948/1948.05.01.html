<h3>國大末次會　討論情形</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大第十六次大會，於卅日晨九時四十分舉行，主席團第二組輪值、由潘公展主席。主席團報告國大通電全國總動員戡亂電文及五月一日閉幕典禮儀式等後，即進行討論第一審查委會之第七號報吿，關於會後設立機構問題，原審查意見爲設立憲政考核委員會及憲法研討委員會，由全體代表參加。其後主席團收到　樹仁等一三八人動議，對審查報吿提出修正案，主張設立憲政督導委員會，總會設首都，各省市及海外得酌設支會，委員均爲無給職。主席團將審查報告及修正案研究結果，亦提出兩點意見：（一）組織憲法研究委員會，依照國民經濟研究委會辦法，由各代表產生單位各推一人，及主席團就對於憲法素有研究之代表推出五十人組織。（二）憲法研究委會及國民經濟研究委會委員均爲無給職。以上三項意見，合併討論。</p>

<h3>某權威人士談話　立院應及早集會　使新政府順利推選政務　總統就職日期至遲在廿日以前</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大閉幕後，總統·副總統將於何日就職，現尙未確定。記者卅日往訪某政治權威人士，就法理與事實兩方面提出詢問，承答稱：「依照總統·副總統選罷法第七條規定「首届總統·副總統於當選後廿日內就任」，此「當選」之解釋有二：（一）依同法第四條第三款所定「以得代表總額過半數之票數者爲當選」。總統選出爲四月十九日，其就職期最遲爲五月入日，副總統則應隨總統同時就職；（二）總統係四月十九日選出，副總統係四月廿九日選出，而當選人確知本人當選應爲收到當選證書之時，而大會則定五月一日致送當選證書，如依此解釋，則就職期最遲爲五月廿日，然不論如何解釋，總統·副總統就職期，早則在八日以前，　亦在廿日以前，始能符合選罷法之親定，故就職前之準備工作，必須加緊辦理。總統就職後行憲政府即吿成立，得發布命令，推行政務。依照憲法第卅七條規定「總統依法公布法律，發布命令，須經行政院長之副署，或行政院院長及有關部會首長之副署」，故總統就任後必須立即依法組織行政院，俾有合法副署之推行政務，此爲憲法中最重要之問題。依憲法所規定之行政院長，必須經立法院同意，始能任命，是以在行政院組織以前，立院須先行集會。依照憲政實施準備程序第六條規定，首屆立院於國大閉幕後之第七日自行集會，現國大於一日閉幕，立院應於八日前集會，然立委選舉尙有問題，當選名單迄未公布，當選立委無由報到集會。此項問題政府應特別注意，然此非極端困難之問題，因立法院組織法第八條規定「立法院會議非有立法　員總數三分之一出席，不得開　」，似甚易通知召集會議也。就目前形勢觀之，立委問題不宜再事拖延不決，政府應從速依法公吿當選立委名單，使依法定三分之」以上之立委及早集會，同意行政院長人選，俾新政院迅速成立，總統就職後可順利推行政務。</p>
<p>李宗仁當選副總統後，廿九日偕夫人晉揭蔣主席及夫人談話情形。（行政院新聞局攝）</p>
<h3>府委會準備移交　張院長可能蟬聯</h3>
<p>〔又電〕國府委會定四日舉行最後一次國務會議，處理全部積案，並作事務方面之結束，傳移交總統府，至新政院人選，聞將仍以張　出任，以期駕輕就熟，惟尚須經新立院之同意。張氏現已奉命籌備，日來正與各方洽商，政院定一日及三日舉行臨時會，討論各項要案，準備交代。據某權威人士稱，新政院成立後第一件事，將為美貸之使用，四億七千餘億美元之美援中，除用於軍事部份外，餘將以生產為使用中心。</p>
<h3>行政院通過　追加軍費案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕行政院卅日晨舉行第五十三次會議，張羣主席，軍事，外交報吿後，討論有關軍事要案：（一）本年上半年度各項軍事費追加案共十四萬億元，通過。（二）軍額以外五十萬人軍糧案，決交國防，糧食兩部商量後再議。（三）新兵服裝費追加案，決議；除已追加四十萬套外，再增製卅萬套。（四）本年度第二期征兵經費追加案，共二百三十六億元，通過。（五）交部第一交警總局卅六年度招募新兵費追加案，決議通過，追加十四億餘，改作卅七年支出追加特別預算。（六）國防部情報　追加案，共一千五百億元追加特別預算，（七）國防部精解決台匯差額並核定去年十月份駐台官兵給與案，決議台匯差額補撥五百廿億元，（八）東北營房修建費追加案，決議：擬准實塾數追加五百五十億元。</p>

<p>早晨九點鐘不到代表們紛紛來臨，大會堂門前熙來攘往，攝影記者都守在門口抬　頭。李宗仁夫人郭德　代表笑吟吟的和每一位代表熟烈的握手，用她那辛苦得已暗啞了的聲音勉力道謝連聲，感激着每一位代表對李宗仁競選的支特，門廊裏一反速日來選舉大會舉行前的繁張與熱鬧，宣傳品和報紙不再有人四處分送·會塲裏的人羣是匆匆進去，可還沒坐穩便又跑開去。休息室裏的牆上掛滿了攝影組的照片樣張，代表們在讚賞着按號碼選擇準備加印。休息室裏辦着發還富選證書的工作，三三五五的代表們在品茗話別。眞個是分離前的景象，忙亂裏夾雜着幾分凄凉。</p>
<p>會塲裏在開着會討論常設機構問題，大多數的代表都如此主張；當設機稱必須設立，要大家來負責督導　政，研究憲法。有的說：「常設機構是盡義務，戡亂委員是官吏，我們不要作官要代表人民作事情，行使政權」。有的說：「我們要設立常設　稱，考察研究的結果不但要提供下成臨時大會參考，還要隨時提交政府注意」。有人對主席團報吿主張常設機構的組織有人數限制的研究意見，大事抨擊：「主席團的意見是迎合政府的運用，忘記了替民衆說話」。</p>
<p>有人大聲疾呼：「各位代表們呀！這最後一次會的時機是稍縱即逝的，我們受人民重託，人民不要我們作六年間毫無所事的代表，沒有常設機構，散會後憑甚麽代表人民，我們有何面目見江東父老？我們有何面目見江東父老！」</p>
<p>會塲里全是主張設立常設機構的言論，大家標榜的是代表人民行使政權，做工作，負責任，不享權利，不要錢，更有强調這機構要設在會內，而且由全體代表參加的。目的是很明顯的大家在覬視着立法院的職權，可是沒有人敢說出反面的理論，祗有張且平提出一個書面的意見，說國民大會的職權依照憲法是不應該設立甚麽常設機構的，行憲的國民大會萬不能在一開端使即遠憲，但這個反對的意見經秘書長讀過去後了無反響，接下去的仍然是「設立」，「設立」，「必須設立」一個高見接一個高見，直到十一點五十三分，贊成的人們自己也聽的不耐其煩，東一聲西一聲的鼓噪起來，高呼：「主席！表決！」於是潘主席公展把審查報吿修正案的修正意見歸納成三點：第一個是賈國恩的要加參照憲政實施促進會的字樣，第二個是顧毓琇主張爲免別人覺得「督導」兩字可怕，機構名稱擬改作「研討」，第三個是戴天球提出的常設機構由代表自由參加；可是在表決前又有人提出了人數問題，從開會的兩千餘人，中途走剩了不過九百多，幸虧照議則規定這並不影響法定人數，由潘主席鎭定的維持住會塲秩序，進行表決，代表們撳最後一次電鈕，表決器顯現了最後一次光明，除了不怕人怕的「督導」兩字外，都依修正意見通過。</p>
<p>散會聲里，多少人發生了勝利的笑聲，國大有了常設機構。（四月三十日於甫京）</p>

<h3>紀念勞動節</h3>
<p>今天是「五一」勞動節，自一八八六年以後的第六十三次勞動紀念日。我國人民是具有勸勞精神的，我國民族精神是以動勞立國的，所以勞動節紀念日，在我國的意義是特別重大。</p>
<p>紀念勞動節用「五一」，乃產業革命後，歐美勞工以流血鬥爭那天來紀念不忘的意思。後來，國際勞工以這個紀念日作目標，要求全世界勞動人們團結起來，組織起來，爲生存競爭而奮鬥，負荷了社會進化的使命。社會進化爲人類所要求，社會進化運動爲人類生活奮鬥的運動，這個運動的本質是聖潔的，應該發揚光大的。惟有共產黨對於社會進化的觀念，與一般社會運動者的觀念扞格不同，共產黨認爲社會進化必須經過　級鬥爭和流血，所以半世紀以來，國際共產黨利用莊嚴的「五一」，塗上了鮮血的血跡。共產黨以勞工的鮮血，勞工的頭顱，試騐其錯誤的理論，而自己却不願流血，甚且半途犧牲或拋棄了勞工陣綫。半世紀以來的史事吿訴人們：國際勞動是一種平和進化的社會運動，不是用階級鬥爭，流血反叛作手段的暴力運動。輓近以來，國際勞工會議許多的成就，以及英國工黨勞工政策光輝燦爛的表現，證明了國際共產黨的錯覺，階級鬥爭的理論已爲時代揚棄了。</p>
<p>今天的時代思想，馬克斯主義時代過去了，民主的自由的社會主義已來到。我國人民是信奉三民主義的·三民主義的時代精神，是建立民有民治民享之民主自由的國家；三民主義的民生主義，是新時代的社會主義，適合我國立國精神的一種時代思想。民生主義的經濟學，以養生爲主，使老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所育，人人有工作，人人有飯吃。因爲人人有工作，所以人人要勞動；人人勞動，便無生活之匱乏；人人勞動，便有生存權利之保障。這是人類平和生活最高的準則，不需要流血去獲取，不需要暴力去鬥爭。一個進步的社會主義者，是反對階級鬥爭的，一個進步的社會運動，是否定流血鬥爭破壞幸福康樂的；一個進步的勞動政策是避免使用暴力方法的。屬克斯王義阻碍了社會進化，必爲時代所棄，國際共產黨所走的錯誤路綫，已成歷史廢墟，同受時代楊棄。全世界的人類，全世界的勞動者，今天莊嚴的紀念此一偉大節日，必須明白訊職這一點。</p>
<p>我國民族是世界最勸苦的民族，日出而作，日入而息，是數千年來勤勞精神的表現。由于我國社會經濟的貧乏，勤勞大衆仍多陷於飢餓的邊綠，所以我國的社會政策，必須與養民爲主的經濟政策組合起來，創造一個進步的幸福的康樂的社會；這個幸福康樂的社會，不僅要獲取了生活小康，而且要走向大同的境界。國父的最高理想，和三民主義的政策，便是以此爲鵠的。去年元且公佈的新筆法，其第十三章基本國策，規定「人民具有工作能力者，國家應予以適當之工作機會。」（第一五二條）說明人人有工作權利，人人得以勞動爲國家服務·人人獲得勞動後，「國家爲改良勞工及農民之生活，增進其生產技能，應制定保護勞工及農民之法律，實施保護勞工及農民之政策」。（第一五三條）這是規定以法律力量推行保護勞動的政策，使人人獲取勞動以後不感匱乏，不虞動搖，並特別注意婦女兒童勞動之健康安全，所以第一五三條第二規定：「婦女兒意從事勞動者，應按其年齡及身體狀態，予以特別之保護」。對於勞動生活的改良與勞資雙方關係，復規定「勞資雙方應本協調合作原則，發展生產事業。勞資料紛之調解與仲裁，以法律定之」。（第一五四條）這是一種進步的社會政策，以勞資合作來發展生產，以調解仲裁的民主妥協來消弭勞資任何的糾紛。此種平和的社會政策，其最高的成就是：不殺戮，不流血，無災書，無恐怖，及人類生活至上至善的準則。新憲法的精神是偉大的，希望行憲後的政府，根據這崇高的準則，釐定各項法律，推行各項政策。今天我們紀念勞動節，唯一希望政府實踐新憲法的規定。而逐漸步入進步的幸福的康樂的社會。</p>
<p>總之，「五一」勞動如，是人類平和的社會運動紀念日，它的莊嚴和偉大，隨社會進化而日新，它的使命隨和平幸福康樂的要求而增進。「五一」勞動節，永遠是新的，永遠是具有時代意義的，希望我國勤勞大衆在萬方歡呼接迎此偉大節日之時，而要緊密的記取它的時代意義！</p>
<h3>全國總工會發表　勞動節告工友書　強調堅持團結要求進步</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕全國總工會爲五一勞動節特發表吿全國工友書，指出要求團結與要求進步之重要意義。總工會之成立爲團結之證明，該會希望以不斷努力密切聯合，使總工會成爲代表全國工人之團體，在總工會組織之下，全國工友邁步前進，人人以三民主義實行者及經濟建設幹部自命，成爲進步力量前鋒，對不明潮流之少數企業家，資本家，應予說服，對最陰險毒辣的共黨則應檢舉其陰謀，俾永享和平，繁榮安定。</p>

<h3>日設海上保安廳　乃重建武裝警號</h3>
<p>滬各界對之均極重視</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕此間各方對日政府設置海上保安廳一事咸表重視。記者昨曾徵詢日本問題專家多人之意見，彼等一致認爲此係日本重建武裝之嚴重警號。據邵毓麟氏稱：「嚴禁日本再武裝，爲盟國對日管制政策之重要事項，盟國當局亟應特別愼重處理」。孟憲章氏認此爲日本俟時機成熟時，恢復海軍省之準備，並爲美國武裝日本政策之進一步發展。方秋葦氏要求太平洋各國反對美國支持日本海軍復活的行爲。宋越倫氏指出日本投降未及三年，舊有機構屹然存在，不特日本經濟即將全面復興，即整個軍事體系亦有隨時恢復舊觀之可能。潘世憲氏認爲日本現在所擬組織的以龐大艦艇隊爲骨幹的海上武力，實有蛻變爲海軍的可能。張光亞氏對中蘇以外其他各國對此事默無表示，深感奇怪，渠主張管制日本海岸走私及其他不法事件，應由盟國軍隊負責，如英美反對其他各國爲保障安全，可另組管制日本委會，組織管制軍隊以防日本重建武裝力量。</p>
<h3>杜魯門將咨請國會　實行撥款援華　華府期待我國提出約定書</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日電〕中央社記者今日獲悉，杜魯門總統將於未來兩週內，正式咨請國會，撥款四億六千三百萬美元，以施行已通過之援華計劃。美國會旣已通過以三億三千八百萬美元作中國經濟復原上之用，另以一億二千四百萬美元贈予中國作軍事或其他方面之用，則今應核准撥給所需要之款項矣。白宮現除忙於應付衆院撥款委員會審查歐洲復原計劃外，而其在要求國會撥款前，尙須解決主管一億二千五百萬美元贈予部份之一項重要問題。撥款委員會對四億六千三百萬美元之援華款項，可望不致削减，即予通過。物資援華方面，關於物資之種類與敷　，中美兩國已獲得廣泛協議。經濟合作局將向撥款委員會提出撥付款項之理由，而復興銀公司則早已墊付五千萬美元，作爲開始進行之用。一俟中國將約定書交還美國，表示願與簽訂雙邊協定後，援華物資之裝運即可開始。負責經濟援華之官員稱，短期內可望接獲中國方面之約定書。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕關於美援人員近致函我國表示簽訂雙邊協定以執行援助計劃之意願一事，頃據外交部息，中美雙方現正準備先行交換意見，將來再行議訂雙邊協定。</p>

<h3>美朝野人士　重視我經液復興</h3>
<p>美籍名律師阿樂門談</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬上美籍名律師阿樂門，前因事返國，曾出席參衆兩院，發表援華意見。阿氏已於前日（廿九日）飛返上海，昨接見記者時稱：大部份美國人，均希望中國之經濟能早日復元，美國對此願盡力協助。美國相信此次國會中通過之美援，將使中國開始其經濟復興之工作，彼等期望此項援助能用於工礦業之建設，而勿消耗於消極性之救濟。以中國復興工作之艱巨，無人謂目前之美貸爲數已足，相反的此僅爲開端而已。至於今後美國是否能每年貸款與中國，全視中國運用此次美援之情形而定，用於經濟復興途徑者愈多，則未來僅得貸款之可能性愈大。</p>

<h3>美現正考慮以限量武器裝　供給西歐聯盟國　白宮對此傅說加以否認</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三十日廣播：華盛頓訊，白宮新聞秘書羅斯稱，外傅美國將以有限制數量之軍火運赴西歐聯盟各國，此說絕對不確。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕此間靈通方面談稱：杜魯門總統將於下週以特別咨文一件提交國會，要求以限額之美國軍械，坦克，及飛機，供應馬歇爾計劃下之歐洲十六國，其中包括西歐聯防公約之五國在內·據本社所悉，杜魯門總統將要求國會對英，法，比，荷，羅森　等閱之武裝部隊，採取有限之租借法案援助方式。該咨文現仍爲嚴密保守之政府秘密，其內容僅有少數最高官員得知。除非發生最後變故，該咨交將於三日或四日提交國會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務卿馬歇爾曾於記者招待會中聲稱，運送美軍備援助西歐聯盟之計劃，正在積極究研中，各軍部首長亦謂彼等正在研究此項計劃。白宮方面加速進行此項計劃者，顯因國會爲全國政治大會之舉行而擬於六月十五日左右休會，並非由於國際方面有任何新發展。如果國會依期休會，則僅有六星期之時間以決定杜魯門之要求，傳政府方面深信如果發生任何延滯，則本年內採取行動之希望幾已吿絕。先前曾傳美國將囑令歐洲集團準備其所需要物資之「淸單」，此事與馬歇爾計劃中各國提出淸單事極相類似。此項軍械援助計劃，將實行杜魯門於白魯賽爾公約簽署之日所提供之保證，即杜氏在國會中所謂美國支持西歐聯盟之語。國會方面對於和平時期限額租借法案計劃之反響若何，現尙不得而知，若午外交政策領袖如參議員羅琪等，曾主張美國之租借援助之實施，必須成立一歐洲　謀部，並任命西方最高司令官一人·衆院外委會主席伊頓昨日披露，該委會最近曾要求國務院準備爲非共產政府擬成軍事租借法案。參院撥款委會主席勃里奇曾籲請增加中國國民政府之軍事援助，而參議員鮑爾亦曾一再警吿，歐洲復興計劃不足援救西歐於世界共產主義之外。</p>

<p>凱氏認爲外匯平準基金會之成績確屬優異，設該會能繼續其原來政策，隨時頒佈均合現實之匯率，不受政治之牽掣，而政府亦能經由中央銀行統制各國營機構之信用政策，則中國之出口業尙可及時挽救，但當注意自由企業必須策勵而不加以阻撓。對於匯款，葛氏表示，最使人失望者，為關於商號盈利，家屬用款，人壽保險，以及其他重要款項如國外所得之佣金等，在過去一年中仍無法匯寄，此種情形自不足鼓勵外資來華。　凱氏又稱，輸入商現時所最感困難者，爲許可證發給及限期分配之遲延。然此二者實不能歸罪於輸管會。蓋遲延之原因，乃由　政策及規例之全部更襲及輸管會之遲遲未能獲得外匯故也。本人對於政府獎勵製造輸出品原料進口之新政策，極爲歡迎，此爲解放國際貿易種種束縛之重要趨向。本會亦曾因事迭向輸管會有所交涉，覺該會對吾人極有禮貌，對於吾人之建議，亦能虛懷採納。</p>

<h3>限制匯款及運現辦法　金管局建議解限　滬穗漢津四局已商得共同意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合徵信所訊〕金管局漢口局長林崇墉，廣州局長高方，均於日前先後來滬，原定廿九日偕此間金管局李立俠局長連袂晋京，天津局長施奎齡，亦於昨日趕到，特改於昨晚同車晋京。頃悉：各局長對於各地業務情形，曾作非正式檢討·關於管制方面，決定向財部及中央銀行當局建議改善，限制滬穗兩地匯歡運現辦法，目前已失意　，確有解限必要。聞四局長對此，已取得共同意見。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據天津區金融管理局長施奎齡氏稱：四局長之是項意見，純係依照數月來實際工作之經驗。彼認爲限制匯兌辦法實施以來，收效果甚微，且引起一不良之後果。華北一般華商行莊，因受此限制，業務已見衰落。而外商銀行，則因不受約束，業務反見好轉。施氏認爲廢止限制辦法，並不致影響內匯之管制。蓋認爲行局儘可利用匯兌率，予適當之調濟也。氏並對東北資金內流之處理問題，表示意見稱：根據過去經驗，證明欲根絕東北資金之入關，係馬不可能之事。故認爲當局應從疏導入手，使之能分散至各地，投入生產途徑，則其對物價之刺激，當可减少。因此彼主張政府對東北內匯地區，除目前開放之北平天津兩地外，亟應擴充至京滬渝蓉蘭陝穗及西安等區城云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自全經會決議自第七季起，將禁止火柴原料磷及氯酸鉀進口，茲據火柴業方面表示，目下上海，江蘇，浙江等區每年需用磷及氯酸鉀原料，約一千二百四十餘公噸，如全國併合計算，恐需較此數增加四·五倍。但我國製造此項原料之工廠，寥寥無幾。長壽中國火柴原料廠雖有生產，然僅敷四川一省之用。至台灣工廠，現每月亦僅能生產十五公噸左右。一年後或許可增至每月四十公噸，然距離需用數字，實仍甚遠。故進口驟然停止，勢必影響火柴生產。該業近已呈請當局對此項決議，加以撤消云。</p>
<h3>六季現額　今日開始</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會方面消息，第五季限額，已於昨（卅）日截止，第六季限額，自五月一日起至七月底止，已與上季一併公佈，祗須俟霍主任委員核定後，即可決定分配辦法云。</p>

<h3>李清泉　夫人談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨天率領菲律賓第一批選乎到滬的李淸泉夫人，已屆五十四歲的高齡，可是望上去，仍給人以中年人的印象。紅潤的臉，壯健的體魄，經過了七八小時的連續　　後，未見倦容。記者去訪　　時，她依然侃侃而談。他說；這次已是第三次來滬了，踏上祖國的地土，使她非常感奮。她表示：這次除了率領菲島華僑女選手回國觀摩一番外，還有些私人的事務待處理，所以全運　閉幕後，她也許還要在上海勾留一會兒。她現在担任菲島華僑婦女慰勞會會長，這會在蘆溝橋事變發生時，宣吿成立。抗戰時對祖國捐獻殊鉅。外子李淸泉先生是非島十華僑抗敵會主席，不幸已在一九三八年時積勞逝世，這對她雖是個重大的打擊，可是她已把整個的精力，重獻於菲島華僑社　公益事業，目前已子孫滿堂，計子六，女三，孫十四，大家說：她是位有福份兒的太太菲島代表團女子副領隊李淸泉夫人（本報攝）</p>

<h3>短跑女健將　錢行素　看本屆全運　談上海選手</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕曾經運第五屆第六屆全運　大出　頭的短跑女健將錢行素，如今已是四個孩子的母親了。可是她對　運動的興趣，始終不减於當年，十餘年來，未　離崗位，現任　南大學女生體育指導及東亞體專教練。這次全運　滬召開，錢女士被　爲上海市代表隊　　　員。</p>
<p>記者昨午走訪這逞雄一時　運　　將，鉍女士對出席本屆　運　本市選手，表示不敢太拘樂　，她搖搖頭說：一訓練的時間太短了，自四月十一日起選出到現在，一共不滿半個月，只能練習三四次。况且平時又不加汴重，本市各　對田　的興趣，似乎已經漸漸减退轉向球類去了，所以本屆　運本市得標的希望實在很少。</p>
<p>此番參加競賽的本市選手共計五十五名，內女子佔十九名，每項田徑賽項目都有參加，據　女士觀察，其中比較有希望的當推聖約　大學代表陳嬴震的跳高，練習時成績不壞，已跳到一味三四。此外市一女中石宗蘭的低欄，也着實有成續，現錢女士正訓練她自五步一攔進人三步，上次練習時三步一欄，已可跳越五欄，假總能過八攔時，可望得分。據錢女士的觀察，石小姐是個極有天才的運　家，身材高大，體力超人，而且籃球排球都好，假如加上充分時間的訓練，深信必可爲本市爭光。　此外，參加百公尺短跑的粵東女中馬申妹，培明女中奚永娟，都是比較有希望的。這兩天，她們正在起勁地練苦功，今天原定是最後一次練習，不渦爲了充分保養選手們的體格，準備加以取消。</p>
<p>第五屆全運會時，錢女士曾獲得個人得分第一名，第六屆時的八十公尺低欄成績，迄未打破，而曾經轟動一時的一百公尺短跑冠亞軍李森與錢行素，更沒有在關心運動者的心靈上褪色，但日遷時移，李森已於五六年前，因難產問題在成都與世長逝，錢女士呢，因格於全運會的規章，任體育指導者不得常選手，因此錢女士這次並未親自參予比賽。她歉虛地對記者說：「現在不行了，事隔于幾年，體力上和年齡上都够不到了。「</p>
<p>根據錢女士的看法，本屆全運中，女田徑最有希望的單位是福建，台灣，和廣東。但據她的觀察：雖然平時練習成績平平，臨塲時由於興奮和刺激，往往會有奇蹟產生。她說：「假如本屆全運中，上海市儌僥能有意外的收獲，那只能說是全憑了一天才」，沒有訓練可言。」大家相信，本市是不乏「天才」的，讓我們等候「奇蹟」的出現吧！</p>
<h3>出席全運警察隊　代表八十人到滬　海軍第二批選手昨同日抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第二批警察隊出席全遝代表八十人，由鄂總領隊　坤率領，於昨日下午四時零五分，乘京滬車自首都到達本市北站，市警局局長俞叔平，特派人事室主任周洪本及科長陸大公，代表前往歡迎，並招待全體人員往榆林路警訓所休息。據周洪本氏稱：警察隊足球，網球，排球，舉重，都有問鼎希望。籃球和壘球，實力均甚堅强，黃桂蘭跳高成續頗佳，達一米八四。茲將該隊全部名單，探錄如下：</p>

<h3>萬米鉛球標槍　海軍擁有好手</h3>

<h3>全運花絮　擅山制服充滿着誘惑性　菲律賓團旗着一頭猛獅</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕如果把這次各地參加全運選手所穿的制服，所　的團徵，作一比較，眞是形形色色，美不勝收·一般地設起來，海外僑胞和南　的選乎，大多豪華氣魄，設計繁複，內地來的選手，大多趨向樸實單純。</p>
<p>就已見的服飾中，該推檀香山三位華僑代表的制服最別緻了·他們穿的是奶油色薄呢的運動上裝，無翻領，兩粒上鈕，貼袋，說是美國　下最流行的運動外套，裏面襯着花色繁複的夏威夷衫。最逗人注目的，是胸口小袋上所綴的圓型團徽，外圈　了Aloha　Honolulu字樣，兩旁有棕櫚樹岡案，正中一個少女，穿了草裙，正在大跳火拉火拉舞。那條草裙，居然還可活動揭開來，眞是充滿了熱帶風味的誘惑性！</p>
<p>菲律賓第一批選手昨天到了，一下飛機，就撒開兩面光彩奪目的緞旗，一面是國旗，一面是團旗。團旗的設計，白色的旗底除了菲島華僑代表幽等字樣外，中間有一盾型團徵，橙黃色底鑲鮮紅邊，中間還鑲上一頭張牙舞爪的猛獅，看樣十菲島華僑代表，是決心以猛獅般的毅力來攫取大會錦標的。</p>
<p>菲島華僑代表們的服裝，都是全套深炒米色胖嗶嘰西裝，此外，男選手們，一律白色襯衫，炒米色羊毛領帶。女選手們，一律白色圓領襯衫，下身不是西裝褲，而代以裙子一條，長可齊膝，跣足，高跟鞋，看上去姿態婀娜，全部西洋少女風味。</p>
<p>大會游泳池的對號座，設在正門八口的一面看台上，地方雖不見大，却說要排七百隻座位，分配下來，每座闊度，僅十四英吋，肥胖些的人坐下去，就有溢出界限的危險。</p>
<p>這次最難能可貴的，是有許多海外華僑單位，在全選會有史以來，還是第一次選拔代表來參加的。已到的有西實，檀香山、今天聽設暹羅華僑代表也可到。他們或她們，對祖國全運會的期望，是如何的殷切熱烈，所以，冷水是澆不得的。這一澆，不僅是减低大會運動的旨趣，嚴重地說，海外僑胞對祖國的關懷，也許從此將日益冲淡。</p>
<p>有一位僑胞代表說：口口聲聲說經費支絀，致使大會　備期間，處處表現不够週到，其實，這是似是而非之論，經費不够，乾脆暫緩舉辦好了，又何苦在大吹大　，使海外人士與　吸引到高潮之後，接着又給人面對失　的現實，難免使僑胞對祖國，感到冷心。</p>
<p>暹親華僑代表團的男女團員，潮汕籍的同鄉，却佔了三分之二，所以說他是潮油代表團，亦不爲過。先頭部隊　繼岳君，早已來滬籌劃一切，業已與潮油旅滬領袖鄭子良洽妥，今天選于抵埠後·將暫住洋行街潮州會館。</p>
<h3>世運足球隊飛菲　南華遠征軍再遭敗續</h3>

<h3>紅樓夢中的幾齣冷戲與南府劇本</h3>
<p>— 唐長孺</p>
<p>紅樓夢書中所演的與所談到的戲幾乎全部都是崑曲。這部書的著作年代據胡適之先生的考證，說是在乾隆十八九年之前。書中所述之事大概在雍正初年。乾隆初年北方人已經不大歡迎崑曲。譬如乾隆十五年刊行的張堅所撰夢中緣傳奇序已說：</p>
<p>長安（北京）梨園稱雄……而所好惟秦聲，　弋，厭聽吳騷，聞歌崑曲，輒鬨然散去。以後乾隆五十年刊行的燕關小譜又說</p>
<p>崑曲非北人所</p>
<p>喜，故無豪客。這裏所指的北方人只是說廣大的觀衆，至於士大夫所欣賞的恐怕還是以崑曲爲主。何况曹家祖孫兄弟在江南共做了五十年的官，曹寅還刻過錄鬼簿，還會作曲，這樣一個受到地域熏染和家世遺傳的家庭仍然愛好崑曲是當然的事</p>
<p>書中所記的崑曲，大都至今流行於曲壇歌塲之間，十年前仙霓崑劇社沒有解散時便能演唱。</p>
<p>但是買府並非只演崑曲，當時流行的弋腔居然也侵入這樣一個詩禮之家（用書中語）來了。第十九回買珍請寳玉看戲，所演的是：</p>
<p>丁郎認父　黃伯央（陽）大擺陰魂陣孫行者大鬧天宮姜子牙斬將封神有正書局八十回本這一段下有夾批云：「弋陽腔能事畢矣。」這個本子的夾批年代相當早，些還可能有是曹雪芹的原批，旣說是弋陽腔自可相信。二十二回賈母爲寳釵祝生辰，云：</p>
<p>二十一日在賈母內院中搭了家常小巧戲　，定了一班新出小戲，崑弋兩腔都有。更明說是弋腔。並且還可藉以推知此時已有崑弋合班的小戲。弋腔與崑腔只是唱的方面音節之異，曲文無大出入，所以天咫偶聞說：「後乃盛行弋腔，俗呼高腔，仍崑曲之辭，變其音節耳。」但是所演的戲却大爲不同，崑曲經過土大夫的眼光洗練沙汰，所演的大抵都是才子佳人與富於情感的節目。弋腔却偏於熱鬧，滑稽方面。賈母愛熱鬧與挿科打　，鳳姐迎合老祖宗的意思，求之崑曲而不可得，就只有求之於弋腔了。我們看十九回中寳玉眼中的弋腔是怎麼一會事。書上說：</p>
<p>條爾神鬼亂出，忽又妖魔畢媒，甚至於揚施過會，號佛迎香，　鼓喊呌之聲遠聞巷外。滿街之人個個都贊好熱鬧戲別人家斷不能有的。便可知其一班。</p>
<p>弋腔旣然承用崑曲舊文，那慶上述幾齣戲在崑曲劇本中能不能找到呢？丁郎認父這齣獻的情節我不知道。孫行者大鬧天宮就是安天會，本是崑曲，無待贅述。黃伯陽大擺陰魂陣的故事在坊間流行的後東周列國志中偶而提到一下，說是前傳的事，但是這部前傳並不是現行的列國志，無從查考。但知黃伯陽爲樂毅師叔，擺陰魂陣與孫臏鬥法結果孫臏把掌教師尊南極子請下山，用拘仙牌制伏了黃伯陽。雜劇，傳奇演孫臏故事的有馬陵道。董康刊行的黃文暘曲海總目卷九有李元玉撰七國記，提要云：「採元劇增飾成之」都並沒有黃伯陽的事，揚州畫舫錄載黃氏曲目還有一種翻七國，不曉得是否與此有關，封神榜在畫舫錄所載曲目中也有此一種，和翻七國都列在一百零五種曲文鄙陋的中類中。今據王著昇平署志略第四章分區，朔望承應項下，記有：</p>
<p>昇平寳筏按嘯亭雜錄云，乾隆初張得天所製演唐元奘西域取經事。</p>
<p>封神天榜原注，即封神演義事。</p>
<p>劍鋒春秋原注說部名同此，演後七國孫臏父子事。</p>
<p>平齡會原注略同前作。王氏又云：今檢昇平署秘藏文物，除板行之勸善金科外，其餘大獻悉屬南府精鈔本，後移歸昇平署者，定其爲乾隆舊物，可無疑也。</p>
<p>根據嘯亭雜錄南府各種大戲都是乾隆時或以後所編，其中一部分爲新製，一部分爲就舊本改編。如上述四本，昇平寳筏之出於西遊記，封神天榜之出於封神榜，劍鋒春秋和平齡會之出於馬陵道，七國記，翻七國，黃伯陽大擺陰魂陣之類是很顯然的。趙雲淞簷曝雜記述乾隆二十一年萬壽節熟河方面的盛况云：上秋獮至熱河，蒙古渚王皆觀。中秋前二日爲萬壽聖節，是以月之六日，即濱大戲，至十五日止。所演率用西遊記，封神傳中神仙鬼怪之類，　其荒誕不經，無所觸忌，且可憑空點綴，離奇變詭，誠大觀也。戲臺闊九筵，凡三層，所扮妖魅有自上而下者，自下突出者，…有時神鬼畢集，面具千百無一相肖者（下略）所述熱鬧之狀與寳玉所見者符合。我想大概也是用弋腔演唱的</p>
<p>紅樓夢二十九回賈母清虛觀拈香，所</p>
<p>白蛇記　滿床笏</p>
<p>南柯夢。這是三本整本戲，分三天演完，第二十八回上說：製人又道：「昨日貴妃打發夏太監出來，送了一百二十兩銀子，叫在淸虛觀初一到初三打三天平安醮，唱戲獻供」。</p>
<p>可知要分三天演，否則決演不完的。這一本白蛇記也頗冷，書上說：</p>
<p>賈珍一時來回：「神前拈了戲，頭一本白蛇記。賈</p>
<p>母問：「白蛇記是</p>
<p>什麼故事？」賈珍</p>
<p>這：「是漢高祖斬</p>
<p>蛇起首的故事。』曲海總“卷五有白蛇記，提要云：</p>
<p>浙江人　國軒編，係明初舊本，後改爲鸞釵記。此劇以劉漢卿救白蛇放生，因致貴顯，故名白蛇記也。命名雖同，情節却異。幸而賈母有此一間，否則一定會把它當作雷峯塔或覽釵記了。然而連賈母看了幾十年戲的老人家也竟不知道是什麼故事，足見其冷。昇平署志略中有楚漢傳。注云：「與西漢演義略同。」白蛇記大概就是楚漢傳的第一本。二十年前上海丹桂第一臺和共舞臺都曾排演過連臺本戯漢高祖。那些述臺本戲除掉時事劇外大半根據舊本改編的。這木漢高祖恐怕就是昇平署志所載的楚漢傳，我記得第一本正是斬白蛇的故事。假使這個推測不錯，那麼應該先有白蛇記，後來南府據以改編，並加上若干演述高祖故事的雜劇傳奇連在一起而成楚漢傳，最後又改成皮簧而在外邊演唱。</p>
<p>五十三回買母慶元宵有云：</p>
<p>麝月等問：一手裏拿的是什麼？」媳婦們道：「是老太太賞金花一一位姑娘吃的東西。」秋紋笑這；「外顧唱的是八義，沒唱混元盒，那裏又跑出金花娘娘來了。」</p>
<p>曲海總目卷四十有混元盒。提要云：</p>
<p>近時人作·荒誕不經，大約倣封神演義，西遊　等書，憑空結撰，以悅一時之耳目也。所謂近時大概也指乾隆以前。在揚州畫舫錄一百零五種曲文鄙陋一類中也戲有混元盒。昇平志略第四章端五承應項下云：</p>
<p>連臺大戲則有</p>
<p>闡道除邪，混元盒據此則此戲亦是由民間流入宮廷。淸稗類鈔三十七册頤和園演戲條注云：</p>
<p>俞潤仙初次排</p>
<p>演混元盒，其一切</p>
<p>裝具多借之內府。本條不知錄自何書，其中大部分抄襲簷曝雜記乾隆二十一年萬壽條，以乾隆年事說頤和園演戲之熱鬧，殊爲可笑，但在淸末混元盒又自宮廷流入民間，正與白蛇記同例。此外如雁門關，五彩與也是如此。</p>
<p>綜上所述，我們可以知道雍乾之聞弋腔流行，像賈府亦即曹家這種人家也常演出，乾隆以後便絡續進入宮廷，所以紅樓夢中的幾齣冷戲差不多在昇平署所保存的南府大戲中都能找到。我對於戲曲史毫無研究，只是提出一些材料藉供談助，其實連這些材料也是人所熟知的。</p>
<h3>論石鼓文用〔〕不用〔朕〕</h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>再答童書業先生</p>
<p>石鼓文用「余」，『　』，『我』，而不用『朕』字，我以爲應在秦公鐘秦公　之後，和詛楚文時代相近。最近，童書業先生在『論石鼓文的時代再質唐蘭先生」一文（見上海中央日報文物周刊七十七期）提出了一個新穎的意見，說是：</p>
<p>石鼓文的文法，近於東方系統，故用『吾』字，它與其他金文用字不盡同，只能證明它是東方的方言，不能證明它時代的遲晚。</p>
<p>這是狠値得注意的。我狠同意於『虞』字本是東方語言的一點，因爲它和『也』字的情形是一樣的。現在童先生的新說，和我的說法總算有一個相同的論點了。可是秦國的石刻，怎麼用東方的方言，而又寫做『吾』呢？童先生以爲『秦民族本出於淮夷，也是東方民族，所以其文字也近於東方系績』，却恐怕未必然。戰國時六國用古文是東土文字，秦用　文小篆是西土文字，這種分別，不是突然發生的。由語言來看，『吾』等於『虞』，「毆」近於『也』，但從文字來看，秦國始終是承繼西方系統的。</p>
<p>我在這裏不想討論到秦民族問題，即使秦國是由東方選去的，但她究竟始終住在西北的土地上，由秦　起一直到秦政未併六國以前，總是西方的國家。如其說秦國在早期還保存東方語言而把「虞」寫做『　』，何以到秦景公時的鐘和　用了『朕』字，何以到戰國後期的詛楚文又忽然想起這』吾』字而不用『朕』，這恐怕是永遠解釋不出來的。</p>
<p>自然，童先生可以說東方民族也用『朕』字，他舉薛氏款識的齊侯鎛鐘爲證。但我在這裏要指明，齊侯鎛，鏡用了『朕』字，可就沒有用『　』字，它所用的第一人稱，只有『余』，『朕』，『辝』三個字，和齊姜鼎相同。可是，同樣是齊國銅器的　鎛，有了『　』字，却便沒有『朕』字，它就只有『余』，『　』，『　』三字了。這個現象和秦國的金石刻辭完全一樣，不知童先生又該如何解釋？『　』字的出現，『朕』字的消失，到底由於方言呢？由於時代呢？還是變一個巧妙的戲法，說前二器恰巧用不着『　』字，後一器又恰巧沒有應用『朕」字呢？</p>
<p>在我們看來，只有用時代先後才可以解釋。用『朕』字的齊侯鎛鐘是齊靈公時代的銅器，（西元前五八一——五五四）而用「　」字的　　在其後。這是事實，不在堅持。有『朕』沒『習』，有『吾』便沒「朕」，鄙人宗旨在此，童先生却去侈言『吾』『我』可以互用，豈非隔靴搔癢。</p>
<p>總之，不論東方西方，由卜辭到金文，沒有用過『吾』字來做代名詞。這無疑地是一個新語言。春秋時，徐國的沈兒鐘似乎是最先用「　」字的。齊國在靈公時，還用『朕』字，（齊靈公的死，在秦景一公二十九年，孔子生一前兩年。）那未，『　』字的採用，總該到春秋末期了。杕氏　無疑地是北方的銅器，也用「　」字，它的時期，恐怕要到春秋戰國之際了。再看西方的秦國，至少在秦景公時還只用『朕』字，這是和齊靈公同時的。等到這個新語言，由東方傳播到西方，秦國人用從『吾』聲的字來代表它，才有了戰國初期石鼓文的『　』和戰國後期的詛楚文的『梧』，到了這個時候，代名詞裘的『朕』字，已是死語言了。所以，古語日用『朕『，新報言用『吾』，在原則上，這兩個代名詞是不碰頭的。我們根據『朕』字在齊靈秦景之際還在應用，而論語以後『吾』字這樣盛行，就可以推想到『朕』字的消失以及『吾』字的流行，應該在春秋戰國之際。</p>
<p>戰國以後，除了引古書，或後編的古書有『朕』字，一般早已不用了。但在楚辭裏有例外，離騷和招魂都有『朕』字，招魂只一見，而且像是摹仿離騷的關係，可以不論。離騷的用法最布特，在『余』，『吾』，『我』三字之外，不但加上了『朕』，還加上了『予』，一共有了五個第一人稱代名詞。我疑心是這位文學家的手法，例如：</p>
<p>帝高陽之苗裔兮，朕皇考曰伯庸。攝提貞于孟陬兮，惟庚寅吾以降。皇覽揆余于初度兮，肇錫余以嘉名，名余日正則兮，字余日靈均。</p>
<p>前面是一個朕字，一個吾字，後面是四個余字。又如：</p>
<p>悔相道之不察兮，延佇乎吾將反。迴朕車以復路兮，及行迷之未遠。步余馬於蘭臯兮，馳椒丘且焉止息，進不入以離尤兮，退將復修吾初服。「朕車」和『余馬』的文法一樣，却用了『朕』字，後面說『屯余車其千乘兮』，又只用「余』字，可見他只是爲文章的美而在掉換着用，如其認爲那時方言裏還保存着這個古語言的『朕』，那就上了他的大當了。</p>
<p>在古代雅言裏，『余』和『女』，相當於現在『我』和『你』，『朕』和『乃』相當於『我的』『你的』，『我』和『爾』相當於『我們』「你們」，或『我們的』『你們的』。例外總是有的，現在人說『我們』，有時也只代表『我』。上次我說：</p>
<p>第一人稱代名詞和童先生所說差不多，不過我字似乎取用在多數。</p>
<p>也只粗舉原則，未作討論。因爲多數少數的問題，原是題外章扯，意只在表明我還不致於不知道『我」字用在多數而已。文法弄淸楚與否，止是節外生枝，豈關榮辱。『專用』可改爲『多用』，『似乎』亦本非定論，童先生所斤而振振者，縱出有因，漫無鵠的，原文具在，可覆按也。</p>
<p>至於童先生不明白我爲什麼不反駁他所提出的石鼓文爲東周前期作品的證據，我其實已經明白說過，我的『　』，『殹』，『迂』三條證據，如其完全不能成立，就得承認我把石鼓移到戰國時代的結論是錯的，假使有一條成立，石鼓在景公以前的說法也一定是錯的。壁壘分明，在別的枝葉上，還浪費什麼筆墨？即如童先生說『秦國在戰國初年，與周天子並不發生什麼關涉，那時的秦器銘文就根本不需要周天子來做點綴』。他似乎沒有去翻一下秦本紀，獻公二十一年，天子賀以　　。孝公二年，天子致胙。十九年，天子致伯。二十年，朝天子。惠文君二年，天子賀。四年，天子致文武昨。這些事實，可以證明秦國從靈公時算起，更後九十年還需要周天子來做點綴，已到了戰國中葉，不久，秦國也自稱爲王了。</p>
<p>童先生說石鼓文用『　』字十五處，我上次只感謝他校正做十四處，是因爲有一處不從午而從支，又決不是代名詞。我旣無意於乘　抵隙，吹毛索疵，就偕改爲十四處了。旣非筆誤，也非排印之誤，今因提及，附此聲明。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>還鄉瑣記</h3>
<p>— 文介</p>
<p>錢江大橋於抗戰前二三年即已開始動工。記　戰前有一次筆者渡錢江時，見橋基已粗具輪廓，可是回程再　　江時，見大塊基石已爲江水冲去。其工程之艱巨，於此可見。聽說民廿六年抗戰開始前後，工程方始完成，曾行駛過幾次軍車，未曾供應民用過。抗戰後不久，即這遭敵人炸毀，勝利後修復通車。橋長一百三十餘公尺，分上下二層，上層行駛汽軍，下層爲接通浙贛路的鐵道。看去整潔漂亮，着實偉大·筆者看了這條大橋，心里不禁感動，覺得中國大有希望。只是橋兩旁的欄干，除首尾二端外，中段尙未修復。行人道亦嫌稍狄，據說不久援予放寬，那時行人欲達彼岸，當不必搭汽車或擺義　了。</p>
<p>筆者過錢塘江後，即換乘簫山到曹娥的長途汽車。這條公路戰前早已存在，惟至今仍然不大平服，尤其是江邊至紹興那一段。汽車每逢過橋時，必大大的跳躍一次，一如物價週期性的在跳然。只是記得於抗戰期中，筆者聽說桂林的公路，其不平的程度尤有過於此者；據說汽車於路面不平處跳躍時，乘客往往會被震離座，高達尺許，頭碰車頂；有的旅客竟會牙齒也被震掉的。簫曹段公路汽車雖也會使乘客被震離座，但尙不致使旅客的頭觸及車頂。總之，路面雖不平，我們能擁有這　幾條公路，總不失爲交通方面的進步，我們也不必多事苛求了。公路汽車與火車一樣，也分對號與不對號二種，愚意這點却須改良，有一律實行對號入座的必要。</p>
<p>無論是火車或汽車，凡是駛過之處，我們總可以看到墳山櫐櫐；極目所至，幾乎沒有一處沒有墳墩，我們直可以說沒有一片乾凈土。心里不免思量：大好土地給死人佔去這麼許多，未免可惜。我國素稱以農立國，而全國各地的糧食恐怕倒是不敷需要量的居多，故而經常需要外國食糧的輸入。如果政府勒令人民把墳山遷掉，利用這些土地去種植食糧，我們雖無一精確的統計，然於糧食的增產不無小補，却是可以斷言的。我國人民素來看重死人的屍體，並且還注重所謂「風水」，以致形成各地墳山遍野的怪現象。墳墓之制，始於何時，筆者未曾考據過，只是據孟子說：「古者棺槨無度，中古棺七寸，綁稱之。」足見「槨」這樣東西在孟子稱之爲「古者」的時候是已經有了的。當初自然是：「非直爲觀美也」，無非是生者「盡心」的那一點作用。可是時間經過了這麼幾千百年，這其間死掉的人是那麼多，一墳一墎所佔的土地總是只能以平方計算，不能把死人集中起來使之像都市摩天樓那樣成爲立方體。你想幾千百年來死人佔去活人的土地要多少？而且活人是在繼續的增多着，依照人口學者馬爾薩斯的說法，人口是依照幾何級數增加的，準之，即使沒有死人，活人本身總也有擠滿地球的一天。何况活人者，死人之對，活人總有一天要變死人。活人旣是依照幾何級數在增多，死人數目的增加自然也是依照幾何級數的。據此推論，活人若不設法改良埋葬方法，總有一天死人會使活人活時無立錐之地，死了無葬身之地。不過我國有敬重祖先的傳統，若政府下令限期命人民移去農田裘的墳墓，輿論之必將嘩然，乃可預卜。但是我們至少可以做到這點，就是不許官民此後再以農田爲墳墓之基地。只是國人素以聰明過人見稱，我料此令一下，人民在農田上新建墳墓，墓碑上必有倒塡年月，名之爲壽域者矣。記得戰前築造公路時，爲了公路與墳墓衝突，勢必不能兩全，墓主乃有化錢使公路轉彎者；亦有公路與墳墓本不衝突，而築路者故意揚言將毀墓築路而詐取錢財者。以這樣的態度辦公家的事，不免令人氣沮</p>
<p>汽車駛過紹興城時，屢見公路二邊缸　堆積如山，看來也是紹興的一種重要工業。這種大大小小的缸與　，外表雖然不如江西瓷器的那麼小巧，樣式雖不如江西瓷器的那麼漂亮，然其爲土質所製，並爲盛物之用，則是二者之所同。以我個人言，倒是喜愛缸瓷過於瓷器的。蓋其精緻固不及瓷器，其古樸則過之，恰如某類小說中的粗綫條作風，看去另有一種韻味。</p>
<p>紹興的酒眞好。其味之醇厚可口，非親嚐不能道其詳。筆者在通商大邑的上海居住了這多幾年，從未喝到過如此好酒各地釀酒的方法想來總是一樣，別無秘訣，我猜大半還是米質的不同所致。我鄉的米也實在好，煮了飯，嗅之有香味，嚼之有甜味，不像本市米店出售的所謂「杜米」或是什麼「薄稻」「厚粳」，吃在嘴裏淡而無味倒還在其次，咀嚼起來，好像還有渣似的。想想實在不如賦歸去。</p>
<h3>哲人懼內</h3>
<p>— 享文</p>
<p>希臘大哲人蘇格拉底，是一個非常和藹可親的人，但他的　子才底普，非但脾氣很壞，而且一點也不能了解他，當然是更談不上安慰與帮助了。所以他每天的時間，都消磨在外面，找些年靑的朋友談談笑笑，來解除在家的苦悶。</p>
<p>一日他在外玩了一天，回來時他的妻子正在洗衣，見他每天都在外面玩，氣得破口大罵，還不能消氣，又提起洗衣的水桶，從他的頭上澆下來，　得他滿身濕淋淋的活像個落湯鷄。但他導是毫不動氣，而且還笑着很幽默的說這：「我知在怒雷之後，必有暴雨。」</p>
<h3>吃在成都</h3>
<p>— 牟敦珮</p>
<p>「穿在重慶，吃在成都」。這兩句話在四川很容易聽見。「空在重慶」先不去談它，談一下在成都的吃。</p>
<p>凡是在成都住過的人，都會知道這些稍具名望吃食，尤其是小吃，種類之多，聲望之高，從建築宏麗，設備具全的大餐廳裏的美肴，而至取簡單最經濟的担担麵，各有各的特別風味。</p>
<p>春照北路近處，有家「鷄油賴湯圓」。也許有人奇怪，爲甚麼用「頓」字作湯圓的招牌呢？實在是在很多年前，有個姓賴的，開了個湯圓店，因爲他具有特殊的技巧，而引起了顧客的好評，一傳十，十傳百，居然身價百倍，來欣賞者絡繹不絕。老板死後，他的後代仍繼續這個職業，掛起了「賴」湯圓的招牌。</p>
<p>賴湯圓的確具有特別的風味，筆者曾數度嘗試，那門面並不大，正面僅有方桌四張，在弄旁另有桌子兩三張。湯圓外表與他處並不怎麼兩樣，領是黑芝蔴，鷄油，糖等，另有一小盆的芝蔴醬蘸着吃。吃起來却是非常可口，與衆不同。每天總是門庭若市，特別是在早晨，吃客像買戶口米一樣的排成長蛇陣，等候座位。更有許多的人趕來吃它的「名」的。我曾問店夥：「爲甚麼別人用問樣的料作，而遠不如你的好吃？」回答是：「祖傳秘方！」</p>
<p>「吳抄手」—抄手即餛飩，是一位姓吳的傳下來的，味道奇美，皮子製造精巧，煮熱後可淸楚看見皮內的肉，而皮子不會破。因爲生意興隆，開了好幾個支店，可是據有經騐的人設，已沒有吳抄手好了</p>
<p>「麻婆豆腐」—一看就知道是個麻面婦人作的豆腐。她不用石膏作，大概是用　。據說她的享名遠在三國時代，諸葛亮派大軍赴川北一帶防曹兵進犯，當隊伍經成都北門休息時，很多的兵去找東西吃，才發現了她的實　　於他人，一掃而光。其時天公作美，忽然大雨滂沱，阻止行軍，兵卒們三天內大事宣傳，於是無人不知，因爲老板娘是麻子，就這樣題了一個名字。麻婆紅的發紫，風頭十足，一脈相傳至今，那豆腐店還是在北門附近開着。</p>

<p>十里垂楊映擊鈿，江南昔昔好春天，暖風睛日橫塘路，繫遍吳孃看戲船。</p>
<p>白紵春衫玉一圍，東鄰女伴踏靑歸，小園粉蝶應相憶，曾傍楊花掠鬢飛。</p>
<p>記否金　葉暖時，紅鐙茜袖按春詞？今宵夢雨嘉陵驛，一樹垂楊一子規。</p>
<p>萬慮櫻心强自持，客中有淚夢中知，斷魂已怯楊枝影，細雨無端又一絲。</p>
<p>落花攪夢未分明，隱隱紅樓雨一桁，最是天涯堪惆悵，東牆柳葉北牆　。</p>
<p>自惹東風自不知，杏梁紫燕愆歸期，垂楊綠遍江南路，一道相思特持與誰？</p>
<p>幾見春風上柳梢，白門烟雨忍相拋！遙憐燕子歸來日，不識新泥是舊巢。</p>
<h3>徐文長論偽裝</h3>
<p>現今戰術中多講究僞裝，在靑綠色原野中作戰，則必穿草綠色服裝，不料明代徐文長也有僞裝偷襲的建議。他在擬上督府書內云：「分爲伏兵者，宜徹頭足裏綠衣，混草木色、惟竅耳目，使見聞，而銜枚夜匿，不使有聲。」又在擬上府書內云：「能乘夜遣壯士二十人，銜枚徹首足裹綠色，混草本色，　　出深苗，渡狹水。」</p>
<p>可見僞裝戰術，並非抄襲西洋，眞正是古已有之了。（弘賢）</p>

<p>— 靜濤</p>
<p>人生恰像一顆流星，牠來自偶然，而去得也忽想，雖然在牠過程中會經飛越了太空，穿過了羣星，而有時凑巧的還能掠過了明月，可是當牠降臨到大地的盡頭時，牠祇是一顆隕石，一粒灰塵，對於大地固然沒直反應，同時對於廣大遼遠的太空，又會發生什麼作用呢？也許只有在他降落的一剎那，會引起少數的驚奇，贊嘆，但這少數的贊嘆是對流星本身抑是爲了這太空的奇觀？這就是人生之謎。</p>
<h3>食油羼雜桐油之害</h3>
<p>— 瘦竹</p>
<p>連日報載滬商陳子展舉齊事於蘇州，親朋之參與者均因素食而中毒，據某醫生稱爲食油中羼雜桐油所致云云。予於此事，可爲證明其說如后：</p>
<p>抗戰後予旅居民明時，曾數度製印泥，初用草蔴子油，後因不易購置，且據舊籍記載，菜油較草蔴子油爲佳，故改用菜油。初無他異，其後交通日艱，生活日高，食油價格因以漲無止境。顧食油雖爲日用之必需品，然以其不便　運　故經營者殊少，凡利亦不甚厚，於是賈者異想天開，以桐油滲入其中，蓋當時桐油不能外銷，價格驟低，用以羼雜食油，其利可獲倍蓰，若所滲之數量不多，但覺油較混滯，食後尙無反應，如多滲則點燈且不光明，食後每易中毒，其病狀爲頭昏腹痛，劇者吐瀉，一二日夜始癒。惟如油在鍋中多熬，或做菜能予多燒，或可倖免其害。故人多不以爲疑也。</p>
<p>某晚，予酬應返寓，時已昏黃，將就榻，家人大小四口均稱頭暈腹痛，不能入睡，予疑食品不潔，或未能爛熟，然細詰所食，均無可致病之由·一女條因食量較大，腹痛而吐，疑爲油中有毒，怒責婢以購油不愼，致大起口角，而予以謂斷無食油中毒之理，力斥其妄。乃女傭竟於翌日腹　後始能起床，餘則越宿而痊，蓋該時該地慣例，於購油時應先說明是吃的油，否則將以燈油應之也。無何，予所製印泥之一部份逐漸變硬，表面結一薄膜，蓋予製泥之菜油，乃分次所購鍊者，頓念前事，始疑食油中恐係　入桐油，然猶未敢全信以誣人也。閱數月，友人有邀予共做食油生意者，予辭曰，是物購運不便，而獲利有幾。友人笑日，汝誠獃子，此中若羼以桐油，利重於任何經營也。予始愕然，亟吿以前事，並勸莫爲利惑，置道德於不顧，友始惕然作罷。</p>
<p>按桐油爲乾性油，只可作油漆之用，有毒性，不可食，方今食油價昂，商人惟利是圖，喪盡良心，　　桐油，以估善價，其罪誠不異盜匪，然物價若長此高漲，則以後　雜圖厚利者，恐正未有已也。</p>
<h3>省電</h3>
<p>— 何島</p>
<p>甲：「老兄何以悶悶不樂？」</p>
<p>乙：「唉，我的內人到鄉下去了六個禮拜，今天回來了。」</p>
<p>甲：「嫂夫人回府，豈非一件極好的事情，老兄何必急得如此呢？」</p>
<p>乙：「老實吿訴了老兄罷：內人在鄉下時，常來信問我是否安分守己，規行矩步；我就寫回信吿訴她說，這六星期中，我天天足不出戶，每夜讀醫看報，消磨時光—不想今天就在她進門的時候，電燈公司送來了上月份的賬單，說是我家上月份全月之中，電燈總共祗用了一度。」</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>民初之幾次大選，以及制憲大權，皆屬於國會。雖有特別組織之選舉會，憲法會，而此特組之會員，皆由兩院議員中舉出，則國會之權威無限，立法　關成了「太上政府」，與三權鼎足之法意太背謬矣。彼時老朽正忙於新聞記者的生活，天天與議院，議員打交道，某日與一議員友人閒談，你們幾百位「羅漢尊者」法力無邊，無事不管，任何機關都受監督，究竟你們該受誰的監督？抑或只管旁人，不受人管，如「天王明聖」「神聖不可侵犯」之流乎？此友笑曰：監督議員的，只有新閒記者，批評笑罵，比議員之糾彈官吏還目由，離員開官員的玩笑，記者又開議員的玩笑。其言亦是實情，但玩笑究竟不是正經，國權應均衡，不應歸一方面獨占·所以我雖不是法家，而不免懷疑。現在選舉與制憲以根本大組織之國代行之，與立法院分開，糾彈另有監察院，則淸楚明白，比昔年之混做一團，進步多矣。</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>記憶像一幅幅的畫，淸楚的是色彩鮮明的西洋油繒，模糊的好比輕描淡寫的中國山水。</p>
<p>一個什麼都不要的人，是一個什麼都不怕的人；因爲什麼都不怕，所以他有了一份兒驕傲，可憐的凄凉的驕傲。</p>
<h3>生活的藝術</h3>
<p>— 歐陽明</p>
<p>生活在十里不見一點綠的「洋塲」中，欲談以自然爲本，以性靈僞歸的精神生活及其藝術，眞難似衙門裏修善，幾有百索而不得之慨。置身碧野幽邃的森林之畔的巴比仲派大師們的手法，就顯然不同於巴黎鬧市中的商品。果庚遠離組織嚴密的社會，跑到南洋荒島上去度他的被人認爲發瘋的生涯，主要理由也在於厭惡這種毀滅方寸一點明的生活環境。</p>
<p>照上所云，是否旣經活囚於都市裏的人就無從　致　神活動的權利了？如果肯定現代生活的眞正基礎，應該建立在較前更廣泛和深入的精神活動上，那末十里不見一點綠的洋塲倒非一定是窒息的地獄。祗要善於利用——精擅生活的藝術，創造藝衛的生活——什麼地方沒有值得你驚嘆的美呢？</p>
<p>什麼是生活的藝術呢？那便是努力逍求藝術的生活。前者是方法，後者是寳踐，但本質上是一件劃分不開的整體。每天，當你獲得一點餘暇時，聽一曲好音樂，看一幅好畫或讀一篇好詩文，在五支光的電燈下，一盃苦茶，一支賤價的烟捲，都足以使你志懷困惱，　對八生回味無窮。第二天，你又很勞碌奔波，爲衣食而工作，但你一定能加倍的勝任愉快。因爲你的生活不祇是出賣時間與勞力，實在是無窮盡的玩着天下最不易厭倦的，最不會惹禍的，最甘美的一種遊戲。</p>
<h3>悼葉秋原先生（上）</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>三月二日的淸晨，我睡在床上看申報，突然發現葉秋原先生逝世的新聞，幾乎不相信是事實，我還以爲在做夢。因爲我昨晚還接到葉太太的電話，吿訴我：「葉先生病愈出院已有三四天，因爲上午在家接見客人，談話過多，頗感疲倦，體溫忽又增加，爲了謹愼起見，已送葉先生到公濟醫院再住幾天。」電話掛斷後，潘公展先生到館披閱明天發表的社論，陳訓　先生因事來訪潘先生，走過言論部，都向我問起葉先生的病狀，我就把葉太太的話轉吿一番，大家都不以爲意，萬萬料不到在短短的一二小時之後，葉先生就撒手與世長逝了。</p>
<p>我和葉先生相識的歷史並不算長，但因最近二一年來天天在申報館主筆室內相見，除了討論社論的題材而外，上下，古今，中外，無所不談，所以也可說我們是够認識的了。葉先生生前自稱：「性好平淡」，我們從他的談吐和風度看來，的確是一位「性好平淡」的學者，不僅與世無爭，而且處處謙讓。例如去年立委競選，我幾次問葉先生是否參加，他總是搖搖頭，並說：「做立委已有六七年，也應該休息休息，讓別人去當吧！」後來經過孫院長的鼓勵，才勉强去報名，當經政黨提名，但獲悉京滬區加倍名額自由競選之後，葉先生就決定放棄，在他寫信去聲明放棄之前，我常常勸他和潘公展先生商量，或者他能帮忙；可是他見了潘先生的面，始終沒有談及此事，而放棄競選的信却已送去了。後來葉先生的缺額，由鄭毓秀女士遞補，外界不明內幕的人，造了許多不堪入耳的謠言，甚至××報的南京通訊，也說葉先生如何如何，我看了報非常憤慨，覺得目前所謂「內幕新聞」也者，還不是一些「揣測之辭」。當晚遇見了葉先生，就把××報指給他看，並勸他去函更正。但是葉先生看完却哈哈大笑，他說：「不管它說什麼？我只要沒有接受別人的賄賂就好了，何必去更正呢？」這種光明磊落的態度，實在太動人了。寫這爲南京通訊的作者，看了我這篇文字，不知作何感想呢？</p>
<p>不問識與不識，凡是路知葉先生文章道德的人，無不認爲葉先生的逝世，不僅是申報的損失，而且也是中國社會的一大損失。葉先生不僅是一個名記者，政論家，而且也是一個宗教家，教育家。葉先生於光緒三十二年生於杭州，十七歲即遠渡重洋，負笈美國；十六年得印第安那大學政治學碩士返國，除担任申報記者外，並兼任復旦大學教授；他所担任的功課，是社會學和人類學，和他的年齡，似乎大不調和了。那時年僅二十一歲，爲復旦大學最年輕的教授，混在學生的一羣裏，幾乎分別不出誰是學生　是教授。葉先生是一個一早出　」的靑年，他之未能享受天年，或許就因爲他出道得太早吧！</p>
<p>葉先生早就有宗教的熱情，與靑年學生相處，最容易取得學生的愛戴，他一生最得意的事情，據　先生親口吿訴我，是在民國二十一年，中國公學發生學潮，學生羣起反對羅隆基教授，使他不得不辭去政經系主任，當時副校長潘公展先生對於繼任人選，頗不易決定，　後還是聘請葉先生繼任。葉先生時僅二十七歲，但至到校視事後，　一次的學潮也就平息了。去年上海學潮　到昏天黑地時，葉先生當常說起他在中公時如何應付學生的辦法。雖然學生今非昔比，但是他應付學生，確能超人一等。故在他逝世的前夕，還有人主張請葉先生到北方去担任某大學的校長呢。</p>

<h3>National Assembly Cables the Entire Country: Unanimous Mobilization to Intensify Suppression of the Rebellion; Passes the Establishment of a Constitutional Supervision Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The First Session of the First National Assembly, on the 30th, cabled the entire country on the total mobilization to suppress the rebellion. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>To all compatriots across the nation and those residing overseas: The Communist Party disregards the nation and betrays the people, raising arms in rebellion with no intention of repentance. They embody the worst of roving bandits and excel in murder and looting. The people are plunged into misery, living in fire and water. Their crimes are too numerous to count. To swiftly eliminate the rebellious flames and save the country and its people, the government should strengthen the front lines and intensify suppression. Our compatriots at home and abroad should strive to rise, overcome the difficulties together, and promote the spirit of military-civilian cooperation, with mobilization to suppress the rebellion as the top priority. We, by the unanimous resolution of the entire assembly, wish that our compatriots at home and abroad remember the difficulty in creating the nation and the immense suffering of the people. Let us pool our wisdom and efforts and mobilize together to remove obstacles to democracy and establish a permanent foundation for the nation. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. National Assembly, April 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The First Session of the First National Assembly, after five weeks of meetings and the election of the President and Vice President, is approaching its conclusion. The sixteenth session was held on the morning of the 30th, which was also the final session of this meeting. It passed a resolution to establish a Constitutional Supervision Committee, following the precedent of establishing a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee after the Constituent National Assembly. Representatives can freely participate in this committee, which will study the Constitution, supervise its implementation, and serve as a regular liaison. With this, all the agenda items of this meeting have been completed and will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion on the morning of May 1st.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Representatives of this National Assembly will serve as members of the Mobilization Committee for Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction after the meeting. Secretary-General of the Assembly, Hong Lanyou, has sent letters to all representatives. The original letter stated: "Respectfully informing you: We have recently received a letter from Wu Wenguan, Secretary-General of the National Government (dated the 29th), stating that he was instructed by the Chairman: 'After the closing of the First Session of the National Assembly, the government plans to initially invite representatives to serve as members of the Mobilization Committee for Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction.' We are hereby conveying this message for your information."</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Youren Presides Over the National Assembly Closing Ceremony</h3>

<h3>Discussion Situation of the Last Session of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The sixteenth session of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 AM on the 30th, chaired by Pan Gongzhan from the second group of the presidium. After the presidium reported on the National Assembly's cable to the entire country on the general mobilization to suppress the rebellion and the closing ceremony on May 1st, it proceeded to discuss the seventh report of the First Review Committee regarding the establishment of institutions after the meeting. The original review opinion was to establish a Constitutional Assessment Committee and a Constitutional Research Committee, with the participation of all representatives. Subsequently, the presidium received a motion from Yuan Shuren and 138 others, proposing an amendment to the review report, advocating the establishment of a Constitutional Supervision Committee, with the headquarters in the capital and branches optionally established in various provinces and cities. The committee members would be unpaid. The presidium also presented two opinions on the results of the study of the review report and the amendment: (1) Organize a Constitutional Research Committee, following the procedures of the National Economic Research Committee, with each representative-producing unit recommending one person, and the presidium recommending 50 representatives who have a deep understanding of the Constitution. (2) Members of the Constitutional Research Committee and the National Economic Research Committee are all unpaid. The above three opinions were combined for discussion.</p>
<p>As a result, Chairman Pan Gongzhan announced the cessation of discussion and summarized the opinions of the representatives into two points, which were put to a vote: (1) Establish an institution following the precedent of establishing a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee after the Constituent National Assembly, with the free participation of all representatives. (2) The name should be either the Constitutional Research Committee or the Constitutional Supervision Committee. At that time, there were only 980 representatives present. After using the voting machine three times, it was passed to establish a Constitutional Supervision Committee after this meeting, following the precedent of establishing a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee after the Constituent National Assembly, with the free participation of all representatives. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the Thirtieth] The National Assembly Presidium held its forty-second meeting at 8:00 PM on the 30th, chaired by Qian Dajun, to discuss the method of nominating members of the National Economic Research Committee.</p>
<h3>Military Institutions to be Reformed</h3>
<p>The Pacification Headquarters May Be Renamed the Presidential Northern Headquarters</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 30th] The reform of the central military institutions is under discussion. According to qualified sources, establishing a new institution to unify the command of the army, navy, and air force, and to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion, has become a unanimous hope. However, the name of the new institution under discussion may not be "Military Commission."</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 30th] China News Agency reports: Wu Qiwai, Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters, said that the Pacification Headquarters would not be abolished after the implementation of the Constitution, and its powers would be expanded and its ranks strengthened. As for the name, it may be changed to the Presidential Northern Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Establishes the National Reconstruction Association; Officially Established in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dispatch of the 30th] In order to unite progressive elements in the country to assist in the great cause of national reconstruction, Vice Chairman Sun initiated the establishment of the National Reconstruction Association. The inaugural meeting was held at 6:00 PM on the 30th at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, attended by more than a thousand National Assembly representatives and like-minded individuals. Mr. Sun announced the purpose of initiating the organization of the association. The National Assembly representatives present unanimously and enthusiastically approved it. In addition to passing the association's constitution item by item, they unanimously elected Mr. Sun as the president. Due to the urgency of time, the selection of the association's interim directors, supervisors, and councilors was scheduled to be done by each unit separately on the 1st, and then formal establishment of branches in various provinces and cities would be conducted. After the organization of branches in various regions is completed, a representative meeting will be held to elect formal directors, supervisors, and councilors. The purpose of the National Reconstruction Association is roughly stated as follows: With the opening of the National Assembly and the commencement of constitutional government, Chinese politics has entered a new era. This is truly the pivotal moment for the nation's fortunes and the people's livelihoods. We, after the hardships of the past, cannot but grasp this once-in-a-millennium opportunity with the utmost seriousness to achieve the completion of the great cause of constitutional government and the realization of the Three Principles of the People. In this critical situation, we believe that the current political tasks are still nothing more than suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Without suppressing the rebellion, it is impossible to guarantee the completion of national reconstruction, and without national reconstruction, it is impossible to strengthen the power to suppress the rebellion. Among the two, national reconstruction is the key to solving national affairs. To ensure the smooth progress of national reconstruction, political reform is essential. Recently, throughout the country, the calls for political reform have been surging like a storm. All the resolutions of the National Assembly and the appeals of public opinion everywhere take this as their goal. To achieve this goal, empty words alone cannot be effective, and collective power must be transformed into organized action. Cognizant of the difficulties of the times and feeling the weight of responsibility, we have specially gathered insightful people from all over the country to initiate the organization of the National Reconstruction Association in the capital and plan to establish branches in various places at home and abroad, in order to summon the people of the country to pool their wisdom and efforts and move towards the overall goal of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. However, the great cause of national reconstruction involves myriad aspects, and innovation is not the task of a single individual. Fortunately, we have received the support of domestic talents who agree with this purpose and enthusiastically participate, which will not only be the good fortune of our colleagues, but also the benefit of the nation.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Decides to Send Representatives to Present Certificates of Election to the President and Vice President; Wu Jingheng Chosen to Administer the Oath at the Inauguration Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Regarding the presentation of the certificates of election to the President and Vice President, the National Assembly Presidium made a new decision on the 30th, deciding not to hold a presentation ceremony. Instead, the Presidium will appoint Zhou Zhongyue and the Secretary-General of the Assembly to represent the Assembly and deliver the certificate of election to the President's official residence at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. Yu Bin and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Assembly will simultaneously deliver the certificate of election to the Vice President's official residence. The presentation ceremony planned by the Presidium on the evening of the 29th was presented to the Assembly for reporting on the morning of the 30th. Chairman Pan Gongzhan immediately announced that the Presidium intended to conduct further research on this presentation ceremony based on the general practice of various countries and would not make a decision for the time being. During the recess, the Presidium held a meeting and decided not to hold a ceremony. Hong Lanyou then made a report before the adjournment, stating that the Presidium had made a new decision regarding the method of presenting the certificates of election to the President and Vice President on the spot. According to the general practice of various countries, they are all sent by representatives without holding a separate ceremony. Chairman Pan Gongzhan sought the Assembly's opinion, and with no objections, it was passed. As for the President and Vice President's inauguration ceremony, Wu Jingheng was chosen to administer the oath, and this was also presented to the Assembly for reporting on the 30th and passed without objection.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the certificates of election for the President and Vice President were signed and sealed by the National Assembly Presidium on the evening of the 30th. The cover and back of the certificate of election are both made of brocade, the front cover is red satin stamped with gold, and the signature page is ivory-colored rice paper, totaling six pages, each page is one foot four inches long and eight inches wide. The first two pages are the main text, written in regular script by Ye Yi, Secretary of the Assembly, which is extremely beautiful.</p>
<h3>Remarks by an Authoritative Source: The Legislative Yuan Should Convene as Soon as Possible to Allow the New Government to Smoothly Implement Political Affairs; The Date of the President's Inauguration is No Later Than the 20th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] After the closing of the National Assembly, the date on which the President and Vice President will take office has not yet been determined. On the 30th, the reporter visited an authoritative political figure and asked about both legal and factual aspects. The response was: "According to Article 7 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, 'The first President and Vice President shall take office within 20 days after being elected.' There are two interpretations of 'elected': (1) According to Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the same law, 'Those who receive more than half of the total number of votes of the representatives shall be elected.' The President was elected on April 19th, and the latest date for his inauguration is May 9th. The Vice President should take office at the same time as the President; (2) The President was elected on April 19th, and the Vice President was elected on April 29th, and the time when the elected person actually knows that he has been elected should be when he receives the certificate of election, and the Assembly has scheduled to send the certificate of election on May 1st. If this interpretation is followed, then the latest date for the inauguration is May 20th. However, regardless of how it is interpreted, the President and Vice President's inauguration period, as early as before the 8th, and no later than the 20th, can comply with the specific provisions of the Election and Recall Law. Therefore, the preparatory work before the inauguration must be accelerated. After the President takes office, the constitutional government will be established, and orders can be issued to implement political affairs. According to Article 37 of the Constitution, 'The President shall promulgate laws and issue orders in accordance with the law, and must be countersigned by the Premier of the Executive Yuan or the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of relevant ministries,' so after the President takes office, the Executive Yuan must be organized immediately in accordance with the law so that there is legal countersignature to implement political affairs. This is the most important issue in the Constitution. According to the Constitution, the Premier of the Executive Yuan must be appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan, so the Legislative Yuan must convene before the Executive Yuan is organized. According to Article 6 of the Preparatory Procedures for Constitutional Implementation, the first Legislative Yuan shall convene itself on the seventh day after the closing of the National Assembly. Now that the National Assembly will close on the 1st, the Legislative Yuan should convene before the 8th. However, there are still problems with the election of legislators, and the list of those elected has not yet been announced, so the elected legislators have no way to report and convene. The government should pay special attention to this issue, but this is not an extremely difficult problem, because Article 8 of the Legislative Yuan Organic Law stipulates that 'Meetings of the Legislative Yuan may not be convened without the attendance of one-third of the total number of legislators,' so it seems very easy to notify and convene a meeting. From the current situation, the issue of legislators should not be delayed any longer. The government should promptly announce the list of elected legislators in accordance with the law, so that one-third or more of the legislators convene as soon as possible to agree on the candidate for the Premier of the Executive Yuan, so that the new Executive Yuan can be established quickly, and the President can smoothly implement political affairs after taking office.</p>

<h3>Government Committee Prepares for Handover; Premier Zhang May Be Re-elected</h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Government Committee is scheduled to hold its last State Council meeting on the 4th to handle all pending cases, complete all administrative matters, and transfer them to the Presidential Palace. As for the candidate for the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, it is rumored that Zhang Chun will still be appointed in order to ensure familiarity with the job. However, this still requires the approval of the new Legislative Yuan. Mr. Zhang has now been ordered to prepare and has been consulting with various parties in recent days. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold temporary meetings on the 1st and 3rd to discuss various important cases in preparation for the handover. According to an authoritative source, the first thing the new Executive Yuan will do after its establishment will be the use of American loans. Of the more than 4.7 billion US dollars of US aid, apart from the portion used for military affairs, the remainder will be used primarily for production.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Passes Supplementary Military Expenditure Bill</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The Executive Yuan held its 53rd meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Zhang Qun. After military and diplomatic reports, the following important military cases were discussed: (1) A total of 14 trillion yuan in supplementary expenses for various military expenses in the first half of this year was approved. (2) The case of military rations for 500,000 troops outside the quota was decided to be discussed further after consultation between the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Food. (3) A supplementary bill for new recruits' clothing expenses was resolved; in addition to the 400,000 sets already added, another 300,000 sets will be produced. (4) A supplementary bill for the second phase of conscription expenses for this year, totaling 23.6 billion yuan, was approved. (5) The supplementary bill for the first traffic police headquarters of the Ministry of Communications for recruiting new recruits in the 36th year was resolved and approved, with an additional 1.4 billion yuan, which was changed to a special budget for supplementary expenditures in the 37th year. (6) A supplementary budget of 150 billion yuan for the Ministry of National Defense's intelligence agency was a special supplementary budget. (7) The Ministry of National Defense decided to resolve the Taiwan exchange rate difference and approve the salaries of officers and soldiers stationed in Taiwan in October of last year, resolving to allocate 52 billion yuan to supplement the Taiwan exchange rate difference. (8) The supplementary bill for the construction of barracks in Northeast China was resolved: it is proposed to approve an additional 55 billion yuan for the actual number of households.</p>
<h3>Qingshuihe County Town Recovered</h3>
<p>[Our Gui Sui Dispatch of the 30th] Qingshuihe County Town in southern Sui was recovered yesterday. County Magistrate Yang Xinghan entered the city on the same day to reassure the people.</p>
<h3>Over 20,000 Bandits Heavily Besieged in the Area Between Yidu and Linzi in Lu; National Army in Northern Jiangsu Launches Extensive Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch of the 30th] The center of gravity of the battle in central Shandong has shifted to Yidu. Over 20,000 bandits in the area between Yidu and Linzi have been heavily besieged by the National Army. The National Army, with the coordination of land artillery and air force, is gradually shrinking the encirclement in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Although ChangLe has been besieged by bandits for 29 days and nights, the city walls still stand firm. In Wei County, the core position of the East City customs is still stubbornly defended by the National Army. Although the bandits shelled the area a dozen times on the morning of the 30th, the fortifications are strong, and the National Army is still able to defend stubbornly, waiting for the National Army advancing from the east to relieve the siege.</p>

<h3>Major Battle North of the Wei River Nears Its End; National Army Recovers Lin You Yesterday; Several Senior Officers of the Peng Bandit Army Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The four columns of bandit troops dispatched from northern Shaanxi were personally led by Peng Dehuai. Because of the famine in northern Shaanxi this spring, they went out to wander around. It is recently learned that several senior officers of Peng's troops have been captured by the National Army and will be escorted to Nanjing within days.</p>
<p>[Our Intense Xi'an Dispatch of the 30th] The National Army recovered Lin You at 6:00 PM on the 30th. A military spokesman said: The major battle north of the Wei River is nearing its end. The county towns between the Jing and Wei Rivers have now all been recovered. The reasons for the victory are: (1) A change in strategy, not stubbornly defending Yan'an and Baoji, striving for the initiative. (2) High morale, retaliating for the Battle of Yichuan. (3) The various units and services cooperated in combat and worked together.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch of the 30th] The Political Affairs Department of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a battle report at 1:00 PM on the 30th, stating that the National Army had won an even greater victory in Changning Town (east of Yongshou) and Cuimu Town, completely annihilating the pseudo-cavalry Sixth Division. The pseudo-commander Wu Jingduo (i.e., Hu Jingyi's younger brother) was seriously injured and his life is in danger. The battle began on the 28th and ended completely at 8:00 PM on the evening of the 29th. The bandits suffered over 20,000 casualties, and the seized spoils are being inventoried in detail. These bandits attempted to cross the Jing River eastward to escape towards Chunhua and Yiyi on the afternoon of the 29th, but were decisively attacked and annihilated by our 82nd Cavalry Division stationed in Bin County and our troops stationed in Yongshou.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch of the Thirtieth] A senior spokesman for the relevant parties told our reporter at noon on the 30th in the most optimistic words: The great annihilation battle near Eryang is underway.

It was also stated that the bandits crossed the Jing River south from Bin County last week and briefly occupied a corner of Changwu, Bin County, Yongshou, and Qian County on the West (Xi'an) Guan (Zhou) Highway, then fled to Lin You and a corner of Fengxiang, Qishan, Fufeng, and Wugong at the western end of the Longhai Railway. The Baoji garrison once made a strategic retreat to the south bank of the Wei River, shattering the bandits' plan to cross south. Reinforcements arrived in time from the Luo River area and the east side of the railway, joining forces with the southward troops from eastern Longdong, first defeating the bandits' Sixth Column on the Xilan Highway, and then joining forces with the Baoji garrison crossing the Wei River north to capture the counties along the railway line. The remnants fled to Xianyang and were surrounded by our troops and are being annihilated. In addition, a large army of ours is gathered south of Baoji, so the bandits will definitely have difficulty fleeing south into Sichuan.</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch of the 30th] Over 20,000 bandits were annihilated in the Binzhou victory. There are no bandits north of the western section of the Longhai Railway. They are still being pursued and suppressed by separate routes.

<h3>Record of the National Assembly: Singing the Third Verse of Yangguan</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The first session of the first National Assembly under the Constitution occupied the entire spring in the capital. From the opening day, the preparatory meeting was handled, followed by the revision of laws, the election of the president, and the discussion of proposals. One event after another, like spring flowers, bloomed and faded. Until today, the issue of permanent institutions, like a late-blooming crabapple, is causing leaves and branches to wither as news of summer approaches. The sixteenth session on the 30th was the last session, with discussions on the final proposal. The performance was constantly filled with a hesitant desire to speak, and a lingering attachment to passing the proposal. But no matter how reluctant people were emotionally, the third verse of Yangguan has already been sung. After tomorrow's closing ceremony, those who came from the people will return to the people.</p>
<p>Before nine o'clock in the morning, the delegates arrived one after another, and the area in front of the assembly hall was bustling with activity. The photographers guarded the entrance, looking up. Ms. Guo Dejie, wife of Li Zongren, smiled and warmly shook hands with each delegate, using her strained and hoarse voice to express her gratitude repeatedly, thanking each delegate for their support of Li Zongren's candidacy. The corridor lacked the tension and excitement of previous election meetings. Publicity materials and newspapers were no longer distributed everywhere. The crowd hurried into the meeting hall, but had barely sat down before they ran off again. The walls of the lounge were covered with sample photos from the photography team, and the delegates admired them, choosing numbers to prepare for additional prints. The work of returning the election certificates was being carried out in the lounge, and groups of delegates were chatting and saying goodbye while sipping tea. It was truly a scene of farewell, with a hint of sadness mixed in with the hustle and bustle.</p>
<p>The meeting hall was holding a meeting to discuss the issue of permanent institutions. The majority of delegates advocated for the establishment of a necessary institution, calling for everyone to be responsible for supervising the government and researching the Constitution. Some said: "Permanent institutions are for fulfilling obligations, while members of the Suppression of Communist Rebellion Committee are officials. We don't want to be officials, we want to represent the people and do things, exercising political power." Some said: "We want to establish permanent institutions. The results of our investigation and research should not only be provided to the next temporary congress for reference, but also submitted to the government for attention at any time." Someone reported to the presidium about research opinions on limiting the number of people in the organization of permanent institutions, and strongly criticized: "The presidium's opinion is to cater to the government's use, forgetting to speak for the people."</p>
<p>Someone shouted loudly: "Delegates! The opportunity for this final meeting is fleeting. We are entrusted by the people. The people don't want us to be delegates who do nothing for six years. Without permanent institutions, what will we rely on to represent the people after the meeting adjourns? How can we face our elders and fellow villagers? How can we face our elders and fellow villagers!"</p>
<p>The meeting hall was full of speeches advocating the establishment of permanent institutions. Everyone emphasized representing the people in exercising political power, doing work, taking responsibility, not enjoying rights, and not wanting money. Even more emphasized that this institution should be located within the assembly hall and participated in by all delegates. The purpose was very obvious: everyone was coveting the powers of the Legislative Yuan, but no one dared to express opposing theories. Only Zhang Qiping submitted a written opinion, saying that the powers of the National Assembly, according to the Constitution, should not establish any permanent institutions. The National Assembly under the Constitution must not violate the Constitution at the very beginning. However, this opposing opinion received no response after being read by the Secretary-General. What followed was still "establishment," "establishment," "must establish," one insightful opinion after another, until 11:53, when the people who supported it became impatient with listening. They clamored from all directions, shouting: "Chairman! Vote!" So Chairman Pan publicly displayed the revised opinions of the review report, summarized into three points: the first was Jia Guoen's proposal to add the words "refer to the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association;" the second was Gu Yuxiu's proposal to change the name of the institution to "Research and Discussion" to avoid others feeling that the word "supervision" was terrible; and the third was Dai Tianqiu's proposal that delegates freely participate in the permanent institutions. However, before the vote, someone raised the issue of numbers. From the more than two thousand people at the beginning of the meeting, only a little more than nine hundred remained midway. Fortunately, according to the rules of procedure, this did not affect the quorum. Chairman Pan calmly maintained order in the meeting hall and proceeded with the vote. The delegates pressed the last button, and the voting machine displayed the last light. Except for the word "supervision," which people were afraid of, everything was passed according to the revised opinions.</p>
<p>In the sound of adjournment, many people laughed victoriously. The National Assembly has a permanent institution. (April 30, in Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Commemorating Labor Day</h3>
<p>Today is "May 1" Labor Day, the 63rd Labor Day commemoration since 1886. The Chinese people have a spirit of diligence, and the Chinese national spirit is based on hard work as the foundation of the country. Therefore, Labor Day is of particular significance in our country.</p>
<p>The use of "May 1" to commemorate Labor Day is to remember the day of bloody struggle by European and American workers after the Industrial Revolution. Later, international workers used this day as a goal, demanding that all workers around the world unite, organize, and strive for survival, bearing the mission of social evolution. Social evolution is what humanity demands, and the social evolution movement is a movement to strive for human life. The essence of this movement is sacred and should be promoted and developed. However, the Communist Party's concept of social evolution is different from the concept of general social activists. The Communist Party believes that social evolution must go through class struggle and bloodshed. Therefore, for half a century, the international Communist Party has used the solemn "May 1" to paint the blood of the working class. The Communist Party uses the blood and heads of workers to test its erroneous theories, while it is unwilling to shed blood itself, and even sacrifices or abandons the labor front halfway. The history of the past half century tells people: international labor is a peaceful and evolving social movement, not a violent movement that uses class struggle and bloody rebellion as its means. In recent times, the many achievements of the International Labor Conference, as well as the brilliant performance of the British Labour Party's labor policies, have proven the misperceptions of the international Communist Party. The theory of class struggle has been abandoned by the times.</p>
<p>Today's ideology is that the era of Marxism has passed, and democratic and free socialism has arrived. The Chinese people believe in the Three Principles of the People. The spirit of the era of the Three Principles of the People is to establish a democratic and free country of the people, by the people, and for the people. The Principle of People's Livelihood of the Three Principles of the People is a socialism of the new era, a kind of era ideology that is suitable for the national spirit of our country. The economics of the Principle of People's Livelihood focuses on nourishing life, so that the elderly are provided for, the strong are employed, the young are educated, everyone has a job, and everyone has food to eat. Because everyone has a job, everyone must work. Everyone works, so there is no shortage of life. Everyone works, so there is a guarantee of the right to survival. This is the highest standard of peaceful human life, which does not require bloodshed to obtain, nor violence to struggle. A progressive socialist opposes class struggle, a progressive social movement denies bloody struggle and the destruction of happiness and well-being, and a progressive labor policy avoids the use of violent methods. Marxism has hindered social evolution and will inevitably be abandoned by the times. The erroneous path taken by the international Communist Party has become a historical ruin, and is also abandoned by the times. All of humanity in the world, all the workers in the world, today solemnly commemorate this great holiday, and must clearly recognize this point.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is the most hardworking nation in the world. Working at sunrise and resting at sunset is a manifestation of the spirit of diligence for thousands of years. Due to the poverty of China's social economy, the hardworking masses are still mostly trapped on the verge of starvation. Therefore, China's social policy must be combined with an economic policy that focuses on nourishing the people, to create a progressive, happy, and prosperous society. This happy and prosperous society should not only achieve a comfortable life, but also move towards the realm of great harmony. The highest ideal of the Father of the Nation and the policies of the Three Principles of the People are aimed at this goal. The newly promulgated Constitution last year stipulates in Chapter 13, Basic National Policies, that "The State shall provide appropriate job opportunities to those who are capable of working" (Article 152). This explains that everyone has the right to work and everyone can serve the country through labor. After everyone obtains labor, "The State, in order to improve the lives of workers and farmers and enhance their productive skills, shall enact laws to protect workers and farmers and implement policies to protect workers and farmers" (Article 153). This stipulates that the policy of protecting labor should be promoted with the force of law, so that everyone does not feel deficient or insecure after obtaining labor, and special attention should be paid to the health and safety of women and children in labor. Therefore, Article 153, paragraph 2, stipulates: "Women and children who are willing to engage in labor shall be given special protection according to their age and physical condition." Regarding the improvement of labor life and the relationship between labor and capital, it is further stipulated that "Labor and capital shall develop production enterprises based on the principle of coordination and cooperation. The mediation and arbitration of labor disputes shall be determined by law" (Article 154). This is a progressive social policy, using labor-capital cooperation to develop production, and using democratic compromise through mediation and arbitration to eliminate any labor-capital disputes. The highest achievement of this peaceful social policy is: no killing, no bloodshed, no disasters, no terror, and the supreme and best standard of human life. The spirit of the new Constitution is great. It is hoped that the government after the implementation of the Constitution will formulate various laws and promote various policies based on this noble standard. Today, as we commemorate Labor Day, we only hope that the government will implement the provisions of the new Constitution and gradually move towards a progressive, happy, and prosperous society.</p>
<p>In short, "May 1" Labor Day is a day to commemorate the peaceful social movement of mankind. Its solemnity and greatness are renewed with social evolution, and its mission increases with the demands of peace, happiness, and prosperity. "May 1" Labor Day is always new and always has significance for the times. It is hoped that the hardworking masses of our country will closely remember its significance for the times while cheering and welcoming this great holiday!</p>
<h3>National Federation of Trade Unions Issues Letter to Workers on Labor Day, Emphasizing Adherence to Unity and Demanding Progress</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper on the 30th] The National Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to workers across the country for May Day, pointing out the importance of demanding unity and demanding progress. The establishment of the Federation is proof of unity. The Federation hopes to work continuously to closely unite, so that the Federation becomes a group representing workers across the country. Under the organization of the Federation, workers across the country will move forward, each with the aim of being a practitioner of the Three Principles of the People and a cadre of economic construction, becoming the vanguard of progressive forces. Those few entrepreneurs and capitalists who do not understand the trend should be persuaded. The most insidious and vicious Communists should be reported for their conspiracies, so that we can forever enjoy peace, prosperity, and stability.</p>

<h3>Japan's Establishment of a Maritime Security Agency is a Warning Sign of Rebuilding Armed Forces</h3>
<p>All Sectors in Shanghai Attach Great Importance to It</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in This City] All parties here attach great importance to the Japanese government's establishment of a Maritime Security Agency. The reporter consulted several experts on Japanese affairs yesterday, and they unanimously believed that this is a serious warning sign of Japan rebuilding its armed forces. According to Shao Yulin, "Strictly prohibiting Japan from rearming is an important aspect of the Allied control policy over Japan, and the Allied authorities should handle it with special care." Meng Xianzhang believes that this is Japan's preparation for restoring the Ministry of the Navy when the time is ripe, and a further development of the American policy of arming Japan. Fang Qiuwei demanded that countries in the Pacific oppose the American support for the revival of the Japanese navy. Song Yuelun pointed out that less than three years after Japan's surrender, the old institutions still exist. Not only is the Japanese economy about to fully recover, but the entire military system also has the potential to restore its former appearance at any time. Pan Shixian believes that the maritime force that Japan is now planning to organize, with a large fleet of ships as its backbone, has the possibility of transforming into a navy. Zhang Guangya felt strange that countries other than China and the Soviet Union remained silent on this matter. He advocated that the Allied forces should be responsible for controlling smuggling and other illegal activities off the coast of Japan. If the UK and the US object to other countries safeguarding security, another committee to control Japan can be formed, and a control army can be organized to prevent Japan from rebuilding its armed forces.</p>
<h3>Truman to Consult Congress to Implement Aid to China: Washington Expects China to Submit Letter of Agreement</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Washington on the 29th] This reporter from the Central News Agency learned today that President Truman will formally consult Congress within the next two weeks to allocate 463 million US dollars to implement the already approved Aid to China program. The US Congress has already approved 338 million US dollars for China's economic recovery, and another 124 million US dollars to be given to China for military or other purposes. Now, it should approve the allocation of the required funds. The White House is currently busy dealing with the House Appropriations Committee's review of the European Recovery Program. Before requesting Congress to allocate funds, it still needs to resolve an important issue of the 125 million US dollar grant portion. The Appropriations Committee is expected to approve the 463 million US dollar Aid to China funds without reduction. Regarding the types and supply of materials for Aid to China, China and the United States have reached a broad agreement. The Economic Cooperation Administration will submit the reasons for allocating funds to the Appropriations Committee, and the Reconstruction Bank has already advanced 50 million US dollars as a start. Once China returns the letter of agreement to the United States, indicating its willingness to sign a bilateral agreement, the shipment of Aid to China materials can begin. Officials in charge of economic aid to China said that it is expected to receive the letter of agreement from China in the short term.</p>
<p>[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper on the 30th] Regarding the recent letter from American aid personnel to our country expressing their willingness to sign a bilateral agreement to implement the aid plan, it is reported from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that China and the United States are currently preparing to exchange views first, and then negotiate and conclude a bilateral agreement.</p>

<h3>American Government and Private Figures Attach Importance to China's Economic Recovery</h3>
<p>Remarks by American Lawyer Alexander Arelman</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Alexander Arelman, a famous American lawyer in Shanghai, returned to the United States for a matter and attended both the Senate and the House of Representatives to express his views on Aid to China. Arelman flew back to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 29th). When he met with reporters yesterday, he said: Most Americans hope that China's economy can recover as soon as possible, and the United States is willing to do its best to help. The United States believes that the Aid to China passed in this Congress will enable China to begin its economic recovery work. They hope that this aid can be used for the construction of industry and mining, and not be wasted on passive relief. Given the arduousness of China's recovery work, no one said that the current amount of US loans is sufficient. On the contrary, this is only the beginning. As for whether the United States can lend to China every year in the future, it all depends on how China uses this aid. The more it is used for economic recovery, the greater the possibility of obtaining loans in the future.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Is Currently Considering Supplying Western European Alliance Countries with Limited Quantities of Weapons; The White House Denies This Rumor</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York, 30th Broadcast: Washington News: White House Press Secretary Ross stated that the rumor that the United States will ship a limited number of munitions to the Western European alliance countries is absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Well-informed sources here stated that President Truman will submit a special message to Congress next week, requesting that limited quantities of American military equipment, tanks, and aircraft be supplied to the sixteen European countries under the Marshall Plan, including the five countries of the Western European Defense Treaty. According to our agency, President Truman will ask Congress to adopt a limited Lend-Lease Act assistance approach to the armed forces of England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and [Blank] Luxembourg. The message is still a closely guarded government secret, and its contents are known only to a few top officials. Unless there is a final change, the message will be submitted to Congress on the 3rd or 4th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference that the plan to transport American military equipment to aid the Western European alliance is under active study, and the heads of the various military departments also stated that they are studying the plan. The White House is accelerating the implementation of this plan, apparently because Congress intends to adjourn around June 15th for the National Political Convention, and not because of any new developments in the international situation. If Congress adjourns on schedule, there will be only six weeks to decide on Truman's request. The government deeply believes that if any delay occurs, the hope of taking action this year will be almost extinguished. It was previously reported that the United States would instruct the European group to prepare a "list" of the materials they need, which is very similar to the submission of lists by various countries in the Marshall Plan. This military equipment aid plan will implement the guarantee provided by Truman on the day the Brussels Pact was signed, that is, Truman's words in Congress that the United States supports the Western European alliance. How Congress will react to the peacetime limited Lend-Lease Act plan is not yet known. Some foreign policy leaders, such as Senator Lodge, have advocated that the implementation of American Lend-Lease aid must establish a European [Blank] Headquarters and appoint a supreme commander for the West. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton disclosed yesterday that the committee recently requested the State Department to prepare a military Lend-Lease Act for non-communist governments. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges has called for increased military aid to the Chinese National Government, and Senator Ball has repeatedly warned that the European Recovery Program is not enough to save Western Europe from world communism.</p>

It is understood that the questions include: (1) the extent of military cooperation that Western European countries can organize among themselves; (2) to ensure the security of Western Europe and resist possible aggression from the East, what level of military assistance do Western European countries need from the United States, including weapons and equipment? The chiefs of the three armed forces of the five Western European countries also participated in today's meeting.</p>

The meeting started at 3:10 pm and ended at 8:10 pm. It resumed at 10:30 pm, hoping that their opinions could be reconciled.

<h3>Next Session of the Security Council to be Held in Paris</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Opposes Investigating the Czech Coup</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The Soviet Union was originally prepared to use its double veto to thwart the United Nations investigation into the Czech coup last night, but the Security Council adjourned after four hours of heated debate without putting it to a vote, and reconvened this afternoon.</p>
<h3>German Constitutional Assembly</h3>
<p>May be Established on September 1st</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Observers here believe that the meeting of the six countries of England, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to discuss the German issue will soon reach an agreement stipulating that a German Constitutional Assembly be established before September 1st. Under this plan, the German Constitutional Assembly, based on the instructions of the occupying powers, will draft the constitution for the three zones of West Germany. It is expected that a government under the new West German constitution will be established in early next year. The Constitutional Assembly will be elected by the states of West Germany, with one representative elected for every 750,000 people. After the draft constitution is approved by the military governors of the three zones of West Germany, it will be submitted to a referendum. If approved by a two-thirds majority of the citizens, the constitution can be finally passed. Since the opening of this London meeting, spokespersons for the various delegations have always kept the meeting situation strictly secret, so they have all refused to comment on the aforementioned report. It is generally believed that the plan to establish a West German Constitutional Assembly is a compromise solution to the plan proposed by England and the United States to establish a military government for the three merged zones of England, the United States, and France. However, the extent to which the details of this matter have been agreed upon, or the extent to which it can be accepted by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, cannot be answered for the time being.</p>

<h3>This Month's Per Capita Rationing of Oil and Rice: Prices Set, Sales Begin Today; Social Affairs Bureau to Discuss Increasing Coal Ball Prices for Rationing to Workers Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The May per capita rationing of rice and oil in this city will commence sales today and end on the 25th. The quantities and prices for rationing were jointly signed and agreed upon yesterday afternoon at the City Hall during a meeting of three individuals: Ren Xianqun, Director of the Municipal Food Allocation Committee; Pan Guangjiong, representative of the Executive Yuan's American Relief Material Distribution Committee; and Ye Shifu, representative of the Food Department. The decisions are as follows: (1) The types of rice for this month's per capita rationing include eight varieties: American yellow rice, white rice, brown rice, and domestic white japonica, thin indica, indica rice, as well as Burmese and Siamese rice purchased by the government. The rationed quantity has been restored to fifteen *shi jin* (approximately 7.5 kg) per person, a decrease of four percent compared to last month. The rationing price is 350,000 yuan regardless of the rice quality. Citizens can freely choose which type of rice to purchase, and rice retailers are not allowed to mix the varieties. (2) The per capita oil ration is twelve *liang* (approximately 600 g). The price for soybean oil, sesame oil, and vegetable oil is 63,000 yuan, and the price for raw tung oil is 73,000 yuan, including a 3,000 yuan security donation.</p>
<p>[Further News] Regarding the general rationing of coal balls, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau specially invited Ren Xianqun, Director of the Municipal Food Allocation Committee, yesterday to discuss the matter. Director Wu believes that it is difficult to assess the quality standards of coal balls, which could easily lead to abuses. He suggested changing to coal lumps instead, but from the perspective of citizens' usage habits, coal lumps are not as convenient as coal balls. However, Director Wu also stated that whether rationing will occur is still undecided. As for the price of coal balls rationed to industrial workers, the previous period's price was 60,000 yuan per *dan* (approximately 50 kg), with the government subsidizing 200 billion yuan each period. Therefore, it is proposed to raise the price to 150,000 yuan per *dan*. However, the Social Affairs Bureau believes that 150,000 yuan is too high, and Director Wu will convene all parties again today to discuss and determine a reasonable price.</p>
<h3>Principle Agreement on Distributing Cloth to Workers</h3>
<p>Regarding increasing the cloth ration for workers, Director Wu stated yesterday that due to a backlog of accumulated cases, he had not yet been able to address it.

As for the distribution principles, he does not express opposition.</p>

<h3>Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting: Praise for Our Foreign Exchange Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce held its 29th annual meeting yesterday. During the meeting, Chairman Ke Xuan delivered a speech, recounting the trade and investment situation of British businesses in China over the past year, and expressing his thoughts on our country's foreign exchange and import/export controls.</p>
<p>Ke believed that the achievements of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund were indeed excellent. If the fund could continue its original policies, regularly publishing exchange rates that are in line with reality, unaffected by political interference, and if the government could control the credit policies of state-owned institutions through the Central Bank, then China's export industry could still be saved in time. However, it should be noted that free enterprise must be encouraged and not obstructed. Regarding remittances, Ke expressed that the most disappointing thing was that remittances for business profits, family expenses, life insurance, and other important items such as commissions on foreign income have still been impossible to remit in the past year. This situation is certainly not enough to encourage foreign investment in China. Ke also stated that the most difficult thing for importers now is the delay in issuing permits and allocating deadlines. However, these two things cannot be blamed on the Import/Export Control Commission (IECC). The reason for the delay is the complete reorganization of policies and regulations and the IECC's slow access to foreign exchange. He welcomed the government's new policy of encouraging the import of raw materials for the manufacture of export products, which is an important trend in liberating international trade from various restrictions. The Chamber has also repeatedly contacted the IECC on various matters and felt that the IECC was very polite to them and receptive to their suggestions.</p>

<h3>April Cost of Living Index for Workers Released: Workers: 262,000 Times; Clerks: 211,000 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee held its twelfth meeting in the City Hall conference room at 9:00 AM yesterday.

The total cost of living index for clerks was 211,000 times, also an increase of 45,000 times compared to last month. The price increase in public utilities this month had a greater impact on clerks, so the clerk index was slightly higher than the worker index. The rice ration was calculated at five *dou* (approximately 50 kg) per person, based on 310,000 per *dou*. All committee members present carefully reviewed the chairman's report and deemed it satisfactory, signing the index sheet before adjourning at 10:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Special Criminal Court Tries Dancing Hall Case: Defendants Argue No Political Motivation; Sun Hongyuan and Others to Be Questioned Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the Police Bureau transferred the dancing hall case to the Special Criminal Court for trial, the court secretly tried the case at the end of last month. After a misunderstanding arose on February 1st when dancing hall workers and dancers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau was vandalized, and the Police Bureau arrested more than 30 people, including Tang Zongjie, Chairman of the Dancing Hall Workers' Union, directors Hu Yunyuan, and dancers Hong Xiaoping, Tan Pei'e, and Feng Aina, who are currently detained at the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau. On the 28th and 29th of last month, judges of the Special Criminal Court issued summonses and brought Tang Zongjie and the other 30 people from the Huangpu Sub-bureau for interrogation. The interrogation was extremely secretive, and defense lawyers were not notified. The judges questioned them one by one, investigating the details of the vandalism of the Social Affairs Bureau in great detail, especially regarding whether there were any treacherous bandits instigating them behind the scenes. All suspects in court claimed that at the time, the Social Affairs Bureau had broken its promise and held the lottery in the morning, causing the workers and dancers to face the risk of unemployment after the closure. Driven by the need to make a living, everyone was agitated after hearing the news, and due to the large number of people, a shout to attack became uncontrollable. However, they all claimed not to have laid a hand on anything. Moreover, the Special Criminal Court specializes in handling bandit cases, and the Police Bureau's investigation of them for three months could not prove that there were Communist bandits instigating them behind the scenes. They were all acting on momentary emotional impulses and had no political motivation. At most, they constituted the crimes of "disturbing order," "obstructing official duties," and "damage," which all fall under the scope of ordinary criminal cases. They requested that the case be transferred to an ordinary court for handling. The judges did not consider this and ordered them to be returned to the Huangpu Sub-bureau for continued trial at a later date. It is reported that the investigation of some of the detained suspects has been completed, and Sun Hongyuan, Chairman of the Dancing Hall Industry Association, and others who are out on bail will be summoned for questioning soon. After the collegial panel concludes the debate, the defendants' lawyers will be allowed to appear in court to defend them, and the trial will be open to the public.</p>
<h3>Appraisal and Safekeeping of Enemy Assets: Diamond Jewelry; Various Agencies and Groups Recommend Representatives to Form Two Committees Respectively</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan, in order to dispose of diamond jewelry and jade from enemy assets, previously promulgated measures for issuing and selling charity lottery tickets, ordering the Ministry of Finance to transfer the matter to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. It is now known that the Bureau has recently obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to appoint relevant agencies and experts to organize a "Diamond Jewelry Value Appraisal Committee" and a "Diamond Jewelry Safekeeping Committee" in accordance with the original measures of the Executive Yuan, in order to accurately estimate the value of the diamond jewelry and ensure its proper safekeeping. In addition to deciding that the Director of the Central Trust Bureau, the Manager of the Central Savings Society, and the head of the Enemy Property Liquidation Office's Enemy Assets Group should be ex officio members, the "Appraisal Committee" also appointed one deputy head of the group, one supervisor, and one legal advisor of the Bureau as members, and also invited one representative each from the Shanghai Audit Office of the Auditing Department, the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Envoy's Office, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, and three representatives from the Shanghai Jewelry and Jade Merchants' Association, to jointly form the committee. The Ministry of Finance has separately notified and designated the representatives of the above agencies and will be appointed by the Central Trust Bureau. As for the one chairman and two vice-chairmen, they will be designated by the Ministry of Finance from among the members. If the committee needs to evaluate the value of diamond jewelry, it may also consult with the Shanghai Jewelry and Jade Merchants' Association to recommend several experts to be appointed as members. [Further News] The diamond jewelry charity lottery tickets are tentatively scheduled to be issued in six phases, one phase every two months, with a total amount of 1,000 German dollars per phase, divided into 500,000 tickets, each ticket selling for 200,000 yuan.

<p>Director of the Telecommunications Bureau Expresses Thoughts</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, recently expressed his thoughts on telecommunications, stating that since the Second World War, technological advancements have completely transformed telecommunications technology. The holding of the Telecommunications Exhibition can increase people's scientific knowledge. Secondly, the knowledge required to use telecommunications today and the complexity of telecommunications operations make it impossible for the general public to understand. The holding of the exhibition can enable people to understand the breadth of the telecommunications industry today and understand that completing telecommunications construction requires mobilizing enormous human and material resources. At the same time, the future development of the telecommunications industry relies heavily on the cooperation and assistance of the people. Small things such as etiquette when using the telephone and sending telegrams, and large things such as cherishing telecommunications equipment and developing telecommunications manufacturing, are all related to the construction of the telecommunications industry in the future.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Shanghai to Upgrade to New Machines</p>
<p>According to Yu Bingjian, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, in view of the fact that thousands of telegrams are exchanged daily on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Shanghai circuits, and the original teletype machines transmit 60 words per minute, in order to improve the efficiency of telecommunications work, it is now planned to adopt the latest six-unit Radiotype teletype machine from the Global Telegraph Company. The machine is equipped with 42 fonts, has only one shift, and has a speed of 160 words per minute, making it extremely convenient to use, saving time and reducing errors. The Bureau has tested it and is satisfied. After the machine is sent to the Telecommunications Exhibition for public display, it will be upgraded on the aforementioned circuits to meet practical needs.</p>

<h3>Aftermath of the "Foreign Nanny" Case: Shen's Wife Sues to Recover Jewelry</h3>

<h3>"House of Horrors at Number Thirteen" Lawsuit: Film Production Association to Express Its Views</h3>
<p>Regarding the legal dispute over the film "House of Horrors at Number Thirteen," produced by Pinghua Film Company and filmed by Zhongdian Third Factory, it was reported that a settlement was reached after the public trial on April 28th. To this end, a reporter visited a person in charge of the Shanghai Film Production Association to inquire about their opinion on the case. According to them, since the case occurred, the national film industry has expressed deep sympathy for Lihua Film Company and believes that the characters and stories depicted in the film, including the loyal, treacherous, good, and evil, cannot be divorced from the various strata of society today. If one film is said to be an allegory for a certain person, then every film or every script has the potential to be an allegory. In the past, unfortunate incidents have occurred with films such as "Fake Phoenix and False Wind," "Where is the King?" and "Su Fengji." If the law believes that this constitutes a possible crime, and therefore cannot make a fair judgment on such unwarranted accusations, then drama and film will be forced to disappear from the world. The spokesperson continued that the progress of the case has not only aroused public outrage from people in the drama and film industries across the country, but also caused international film industry professionals to express shock. For this reason, the Association will make a serious statement.</p>

<h3>Refugees and Unemployed Workers Invite Reporters to Appeal</h3>

Although the Municipal Council passed a resolution at its third meeting requesting the municipal government to approve it, there has been no result. Later, the fifth general meeting of the Municipal Council again resolved that driving in the suburbs would not hinder traffic in the urban area and again requested the municipal government to approve it, but more than a month has passed and the authorities still ignored it, causing the refugees to have no way to survive. Therefore, they are making another appeal.</p>
<h3>Road Bureau to Repair and Expand Wuxi Station</h3>

<h3>Restrictions on Remittances and Cash Transportation, the Gold Control Bureau Recommends Lifting Restrictions, the Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Tianjin Bureaus Have Reached a Consensus</h3>
<p>[United Credit Bureau News] Lin Chongyong, Director of the Hankou Gold Control Bureau, and Gao Fang, Director of the Guangzhou Bureau, came to Shanghai one after another a few days ago. They were originally scheduled to go to Beijing together with Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, on the 29th. Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Bureau, also rushed here yesterday. They changed their plans and went to Beijing together by car last night. It is learned that the directors have made informal reviews of the business situation in various places. Regarding control aspects, it was decided to recommend improvements to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank authorities. The current restrictions on remittance and cash transportation between Shanghai and Guangzhou have lost their meaning, and it is indeed necessary to lift the restrictions. It is reported that the four directors have reached a consensus on this.</p>
<p>[Also News] According to Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Financial Administration Bureau, the four directors' opinions are purely based on the experience of actual work in recent months. He believes that since the implementation of the restrictions on remittances, the effect has been very small, and it has caused a bad consequence. The business of general Chinese merchants and banks in North China has declined due to this restriction. However, foreign banks are not restricted, and their business has improved. Shi believes that abolishing the restrictions will not affect the control of internal remittances, as banks can use the exchange rate to make appropriate adjustments. He also expressed his views on the handling of the inflow of funds from Northeast China, saying that based on past experience, it has been proven impossible to completely eliminate the entry of funds from Northeast China. Therefore, it is believed that the authorities should start from channeling and disperse it to various places and invest it in production, which can reduce its stimulation to prices. Therefore, he advocates that the government should expand the areas for internal remittances from Northeast China beyond the current open areas of Beiping and Tianjin to areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Shaanxi, Guangzhou, and Xi'an.</p>

In particular, the local market is more welcoming of Qimen tea powder and floral fragrance. Prices were consistently stable. However, this year's new goods are gradually aging due to the arrival of goods from the source. The bottom plate is extremely weak. As for the foreign tea market, exporters were still inactive, but the principals felt that the new tea had not yet arrived and the inventory of old tea was about to be exhausted, so their intention to remain conservative was firm. However, the market remained quiet with little activity, resulting in a calm and unchanged situation.</p>

<h3>Match Industry Asks for Cancellation of Restrictions on Raw Material Imports</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the match industry is requesting the authorities to cancel the decision made by the National Economic Conference to prohibit the import of phosphorus and potassium chlorate, raw materials for matches, starting from the seventh quarter. According to the match industry, the current annual demand for phosphorus and potassium chlorate raw materials in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang regions is approximately 1,240 metric tons. If combined with the national calculation, it is feared that this number would increase by four to five times. However, there are very few factories in China that manufacture these raw materials. Although the Changshou China Match Raw Material Factory has production, it is only sufficient for Sichuan Province. As for the Taiwan factory, it can currently only produce about 15 metric tons per month. After one year, it may be possible to increase it to 40 metric tons per month, but it is still far from the required number. Therefore, a sudden stop of imports will inevitably affect match production. The industry has recently submitted a request to the authorities to cancel this decision.</p>

<h3>Female Sprint Athlete Qian Hangsu Discusses the Current National Games and Shanghai Athletes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] Qian Hangsu, a female sprint athlete who made a big splash in the 5th and 6th National Games, is now the mother of four children. However, her interest in sports has not diminished from those years. For more than ten years, she has never left her post and is currently a sports instructor for female students at Jinan University and a coach at the East Asia Institute of Physical Education. This time, the National Games are being held in Shanghai, and Ms. Qian has been appointed as a member of the Shanghai team's selection committee.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited this athlete who once dominated the sports scene yesterday afternoon, Ms. Qian said that she did not dare to be too optimistic about the Shanghai athletes participating in this National Games. She shook her head and said: "The training time is too short. It has been less than half a month from the selection on April 11th to the present, and they can only practice three or four times. Moreover, they usually don't pay attention to it. The interest of various schools in the city in track and field seems to have gradually decreased and turned to ball games, so the hope of winning a medal in this National Games is really very small."</p>
<p>A total of 55 athletes from the city will participate in the competition, including 19 women. All track and field events will be participated in. According to Ms. Qian's observation, the most promising one is Chen Yingzhen from St. John's University in the high jump. The results are not bad during practice and she has jumped to 1.34 meters. In addition, Shi Zonglan of Shanghai No. 1 Girls' High School is also making progress in the low hurdles. Ms. Qian is currently training her to move from five steps to one hurdle to three steps. Last time she practiced, she was able to jump over five hurdles with three steps. If she can pass eight hurdles, she can be expected to score points. According to Ms. Qian's observation, Miss Shi is a very talented athlete, tall, with superhuman strength, and good at both basketball and volleyball. If she is given sufficient training time, it is believed that she will definitely win glory for the city. In addition, Ma Shenmei of Guangdong East Girls' High School and Xi Yongjuan of Peiming Girls' High School, who are participating in the 100-meter sprint, are relatively promising. These two days, they are working hard to practice. Today was originally scheduled to be the last practice, but in order to fully maintain the athletes' physique, it is planned to be cancelled.</p>
<p>At the 5th National Games, Ms. Qian won the first place in individual scoring. The 80-meter low hurdle result from the 6th National Games has not been broken yet. The 100-meter sprint championship and runner-up, Li Sen and Qian Hangsu, have not faded from the minds of sports enthusiasts. However, as time goes by, Li Sen passed away due to childbirth problems in Chengdu five or six years ago. As for Ms. Qian, because of the regulations of the National Games, sports instructors are not allowed to be athletes, so Ms. Qian did not participate in the competition this time. She said apologetically to the reporter: "It's not possible now. After so many years, my physical strength and age are not enough."</p>
<p>According to Ms. Qian's opinion, the most promising units in women's track and field in this National Games are Fujian, Taiwan, and Guangdong. But according to her observation: although the practice results are mediocre, miracles often occur due to excitement and stimulation on the field. She said: "If Shanghai can have unexpected gains in this National Games, it can only be said that it is entirely due to talent, without any training to speak of."

<h3>Navy Has Good Athletes in 10,000 Meters, Shot Put, and Javelin</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Navy participated in the National Games, and the second batch of 46 representatives, led by General Team Leader Jia Lianhong, arrived at the city's North Station at 4:05 pm this afternoon on the Beijing-Shanghai train. All personnel are staying at the Navy First Hospital on Sichuan North Road. Various naval units stationed in Shanghai sent representatives to welcome them at the North Station, and a welcoming banquet was held at the Navy Social Center at 6:30 pm last night. The names of all 81 Navy team representatives were seen in the April 28th edition. Currently, only four people, including Li Yongnian and Kou Hongfei, are still staying in the capital due to official business, and the rest have all arrived in the city. The team's athletes, Liu Jingkun's 10,000 meters and 5,000 meters, have quite good results. Wu Zhenwu's shot put can throw 12.30 meters, Wang Xuewu's javelin is often around 50 meters, and Zhang Zhiqing's 400-meter hurdles are 62 seconds. All of them are promising athletes to be selected.</p>

<h3>National Games Tidbits, Honolulu Uniforms are Full of Temptation, Philippine Team Flag Features a Fierce Lion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] If we compare the uniforms and team emblems worn by athletes from various places participating in the National Games this time, they are truly colorful and beautiful. Generally speaking, overseas Chinese and South Pacific athletes are mostly luxurious and elaborately designed, while athletes from the mainland tend to be simple and unadorned.</p>
<p>Among the costumes that have been seen, the uniforms of the three Hawaiian overseas Chinese representatives are the most unique. They wear cream-colored thin wool sports tops, no lapels, two top buttons, patch pockets, said to be the most popular sports jackets in the United States, lined with Hawaiian shirts with complex floral patterns. The most eye-catching thing is the circular team emblem attached to the small pocket on the chest. The outer circle reads "Aloha Honolulu", with palm tree patterns on both sides, and in the center is a girl wearing a grass skirt, dancing the hula hula. The grass skirt can even be opened and moved, which is truly full of the temptation of tropical flavors!</p>
<p>The first batch of Philippine athletes arrived yesterday. As soon as they got off the plane, they unfurled two dazzling satin flags, one was the national flag and the other was the team flag. The design of the team flag is a white flag bottom, in addition to the words Philippine Overseas Chinese Delegation, etc., there is a shield-shaped team emblem in the middle, with an orange-yellow bottom bordered with bright red, and in the middle is also inlaid with a fierce lion with its teeth and claws bared. It seems that the Philippine Overseas Chinese representatives are determined to seize the Games championship with the perseverance of a fierce lion.</p>
<p>The costumes of the Philippine overseas Chinese representatives are all full sets of dark beige poplin suits. In addition, the male athletes all wear white shirts and beige wool ties. The female athletes all wear white round-neck shirts, and instead of suit pants, they wear skirts that reach the knees, with bare feet and high heels, looking graceful and full of Western girl style.</p>
<p>The numbered seats in the Games swimming pool are located on a stand facing the main entrance, and although the place is not large, it is said that 700 seats will be arranged. When allocated, the width of each seat is only 14 inches. If a fatter person sits down, there is a risk of overflowing the boundaries.</p>
<p>What is most commendable this time is that many overseas Chinese units are participating for the first time in the history of the National Games. Those who have arrived include West Samoa and Honolulu. It is said that the Siamese overseas Chinese representatives will also arrive today. How eager and enthusiastic their expectations for the motherland's National Games are, so cold water must not be poured. This pouring will not only reduce the purpose of the Games, but seriously speaking, the concern of overseas Chinese for the motherland may gradually fade away from now on.</p>
<p>One overseas Chinese representative said: "They repeatedly say that the funds are insufficient, which makes the preparations for the Games seem inadequate everywhere. In fact, this is a specious argument. If the funds are not enough, it is better to postpone the event. Why bother making a big show and attracting overseas people to a climax, and then giving people the reality of facing disappointment, it is inevitable that overseas Chinese will feel cold-hearted towards the motherland."</p>
<p>Among the male and female team members of the Siamese overseas Chinese delegation, those from the Chaozhou and Shantou region account for two-thirds, so it is no exaggeration to say that it is the Chaozhou delegation. The advance unit, Ji Yuejun, had already come to Shanghai to plan everything, and had already negotiated with Zheng Ziliang, the leader of the Chaozhou community in Shanghai. After the team arrives today, they will temporarily stay at the Chaozhou Guild Hall on Yangxing Street.</p>
<h3>World Games Football Team Flies to the Philippines, South China Expeditionary Force Suffers Another Defeat</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 30th] The Chinese World Games football team took a plane to Manila at 1:00 pm today.

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 30th] In the third battle of the South China football expeditionary force in the Philippines, they were defeated by the Overseas Chinese University United Team 1-3 on the evening of the 29th. The match was still held at the Rizal Stadium. South China captain Liang Rongzhao and starting goalkeeper Li Huihe did not play.</p>
<h3>Preferential Measures for Student Visits</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Municipal Private Primary and Secondary School Federation, Jiang Jizhou, Tong Hangbai, Yu Chuanding, Shen Xibin, Mao Jiaju, and Cui Jianwu, etc., visited Mr. Hao, the general director of the National Games, yesterday to discuss preferential measures for school group visits and transportation issues for students in the Games gymnastics. The following agreements were reached: (1) The track and field stadium will reserve 2,000 seats every day to accommodate student visits. The concessionary tickets will be sold at 10,000 yuan per ticket, but the school must apply with a letter. (2) Students participating in the Games gymnastics rehearsal and formal performance will be subsidized for transportation expenses.</p>
<h3>Malay-Cantonese-Guangzhou Athletes: Second Batch Arrived Yesterday by Plane</h3>

Some standards exceed the national records, such as the 60-meter dash for women, which was set at 7.8 seconds, causing Wang Xuefang, who won the 50-meter, 100-meter, and long jump championships at the last National Games and who now runs the 60-meter in 8 seconds, to be unable to participate in the National Games.

<h3>Several Obscure Operas in *Dream of the Red Chamber* and the Scripts of the Southern Troupe</h3>
<p>— Tang Changru</p>
<p>Almost all the operas performed or mentioned in *Dream of the Red Chamber* are *Kunqu*. According to Mr. Hu Shih's research, this book was written before the 18th or 19th year of the Qianlong era. The events described in the book probably took place in the early years of the Yongzheng reign. By the early Qianlong era, northerners were no longer very fond of *Kunqu*. For example, the preface to *Mengzhong Yuan Zhuanqi*, written by Zhang Jian and published in the 15th year of Qianlong, already stated:</p>
<p>The Liyuan troupe in Chang'an (Beijing) reigns supreme... but they only like Qin tunes and *Yiyangqiang*, and hate to hear the Wu sounds. Whenever they hear *Kunqu* songs, they scatter in an uproar. Later, *Yan Guan Xiao Pu*, published in the 50th year of Qianlong, said:</p>
<p>*Kunqu* is not liked by northerners, so there are no generous patrons. Here, the term "northerners" refers only to the general audience, but the literati probably still mainly appreciated *Kunqu*. Moreover, the Cao family, grandfather, grandson, and brothers, served as officials in Jiangnan for a total of fifty years. Cao Yin even engraved the *Lü Gui Bu* and could compose music. It is only natural that a family so influenced by regional culture and heredity would still love *Kunqu*.</p>
<p>Most of the *Kunqu* operas recorded in the book are still popular on the operatic stage today. When the Xian Ni Kunqu Opera Troupe was not disbanded ten years ago, they could perform them.</p>
<p>However, the Jia household did not only perform *Kunqu*. *Yiyangqiang*, which was popular at the time, even infiltrated this scholarly family (to use the words of the book). In the 19th chapter, Jia Zhen invites Baoyu to watch an opera. What is performed is:</p>
<p>*Ding Lang Recognizes His Father*, *Huang Boyang Sets Up the Yin Soul Array*, *Sun Wukong Raises Havoc in Heaven*, *Jiang Ziya Executes Generals and Consecrates Gods*. The 80-chapter edition of the Youzheng Bookstore has a marginal note under this section that reads: "The talents of *Yiyangqiang* are exhausted." The marginal notes in this edition are quite early, and some may even be original notes by Cao Xueqin. Since it says *Yiyangqiang*, it is believable. In the 22nd chapter, the Old Dowager celebrates Baocai's birthday, saying:</p>
<p>On the 21st, a small, simple opera stage was set up in the Old Dowager's inner courtyard, and a troupe of newly emerging opera performers was hired, with both *Kunqu* and *Yiyangqiang* operas. This clearly states that it is *Yiyangqiang*. Furthermore, it can be inferred that at this time, there were already small opera troupes that performed both *Kunqu* and *Yiyangqiang*. The only difference between *Yiyangqiang* and *Kunqu* is the tone and rhythm of the singing; the lyrics are not very different. Therefore, *Tian Zhi Ou Wen* says: "Later, *Yiyangqiang* became popular, commonly known as *Gaoqiang*, which still uses the lyrics of *Kunqu* but changes its tone and rhythm." However, the operas performed are very different. *Kunqu*, after being refined and sifted through by literati, mostly performs stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies and programs rich in emotion. *Yiyangqiang*, however, tends to favor lively and humorous aspects. The Old Dowager loves excitement and interludes of humor. What Fengjie seeks to cater to the Old Dowager's preferences cannot be found in *Kunqu*, so she can only seek it in *Yiyangqiang*. Let us see what *Yiyangqiang* looked like in Baoyu's eyes in the 19th chapter. The book says:</p>
<p>Ghosts and gods appeared in a chaotic mess, and then demons swarmed out. There were even processions and incense-welcoming ceremonies, and the sounds of drums and shouts could be heard far outside the alley. Everyone in the street praised the liveliness of the opera, which could not be found in other people's homes. This gives an idea of what it was like.</p>
<p>Since *Yiyangqiang* used the old texts of *Kunqu*, can we find these operas mentioned above in *Kunqu* scripts? I do not know the plot of the opera *Ding Lang Recognizes His Father*. *Sun Wukong Raises Havoc in Heaven* is *An Tian Hui*, which is originally a *Kunqu* opera and needs no further explanation. The story of *Huang Boyang Sets Up the Yin Soul Array* is occasionally mentioned in the popular *Later Eastern Zhou Kingdoms*, saying that it is a matter of the prequel, but this prequel is not the current *Annals of the Eastern Kingdoms*, so there is no way to check. However, it is known that Huang Boyang was Yue Yi's teacher. In order to battle the Yin Soul Array against Sun Bin, Sun Bin invited the head teacher, the Antarctic Immortal, down the mountain and subdued Huang Boyang with the Immortal Binding Talisman. There are *Ma Ling Dao* dramas and legends that tell the story of Sun Bin. Volume 9 of the *Qu Hai Zong Mu* compiled by Dong Kang has *Qi Guo Ji* written by Li Yuanyu. The summary says: "Selected Yuan dramas and embellished them into it." There is no mention of Huang Boyang. The *Yangzhou Hua Fang Lu* records that Huang's repertoire also has a *Fan Qi Guo*. I don't know if it has anything to do with this. There is also a kind of *Feng Shen Bang* in the repertoire recorded in the *Hua Fang Lu*, both of which are listed in the mediocre category of one hundred and five kinds of opera lyrics. According to Wang's *Sheng Ping Shu Zhi Lüe*, Chapter 4, Partitioning, the section on performing for the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, records:</p>
<p>*Sheng Ping Bao Fa*. According to *Xiao Ting Za Lu*, it was made by Zhang Detian in the early Qianlong period to perform the story of Tang Xuanzang's journey to the West.</p>
<p>*Feng Shen Tian Bang*. The original note says that it is the same as *Feng Shen Yan Yi*.</p>
<p>*Jian Feng Chun Qiu*. The original note says the name of the novel is the same, and it tells the story of Sun Bin and his son in the Later Seven Kingdoms.</p>
<p>*Ping Ling Hui*. The original note says it is slightly the same as the previous work. Wang also said: Now, examining the secret collections of cultural relics of the Sheng Ping Shu, apart from the printed edition of *Quan Shan Jin Ke*, the rest of the major operas are all finely copied Southern Troupe versions. Those that were later moved to the Sheng Ping Shu can be determined to be old objects from the Qianlong period without a doubt.</p>
<p>According to *Xiao Ting Za Lu*, various major operas of the Southern Troupe were all compiled during or after the Qianlong period. Some of them were newly made, and some were adapted from old versions. For example, *Sheng Ping Bao Fa* came from *Journey to the West*, *Feng Shen Tian Bang* came from *Feng Shen Bang*, and *Jian Feng Chun Qiu* and *Ping Ling Hui* came from *Ma Ling Dao*, *Qi Guo Ji*, *Fan Qi Guo*, *Huang Boyang Sets Up the Yin Soul Array* and the like. Zhao Yuncong's *Yan Pu Za Ji* describes the grand occasion of the Qianlong 21st year of the Longevity Festival at Rehe: The autumn hunt went to Rehe, and all the Mongolian princes watched. The Longevity Holy Festival was two days before Mid-Autumn Festival, so on the sixth day of the month, a grand opera was performed until the fifteenth day. The operas performed mostly used gods and monsters from *Journey to the West* and *Feng Shen Chuan*. Its absurdity and unreliability were unrestricted, and it could be embellished out of thin air, bizarre and strange, truly a grand sight. The opera stage was nine *yan* wide and had three layers. The demons played sometimes came from above and sometimes protruded from below... Sometimes gods and ghosts gathered together, with hundreds of masks and no two alike (omitted below). The liveliness described matches what Baoyu saw. I think it was probably also sung in *Yiyangqiang*.</p>
<p>In the 29th chapter of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the Old Dowager offers incense at Qingxu Monastery, and what they perform is</p>
<p>*Legend of the White Snake*, *A Bed Full of Tablets*,</p>
<p>*A Dream of Nanke*. These are three complete operas, performed over three days. The 28th chapter says: The people in charge said again: "Yesterday, the Imperial Concubine sent Eunuch Xia out to deliver one hundred and twenty taels of silver, asking to hold a three-day peace-seeking Taoist ceremony at Qingxu Monastery from the first to the third day of the month, performing operas and offering sacrifices."</p>
<p>It can be known that it had to be performed for three days, otherwise it could not be finished. This *Legend of the White Snake* is also quite obscure. The book says:</p>
<p>Jia Zhen came back for a while and said, "An opera has been chosen before the gods. The first opera is *Legend of the White Snake*." The Old Dowager asked, "What is the story of *Legend of the White Snake*?" Jia Zhen said: "It is the story that starts with Emperor Gaozu of Han slaying the snake." Volume 5 of *Qu Hai Zong Mu* has *Bai She Ji*, and the summary says:</p>
<p>Compiled by Guo Xuan, a native of Zhejiang. It is an old version from the early Ming Dynasty, later changed to *Luan Chai Ji*. This play is named *Legend of the White Snake* because Liu Hanqing saved the white snake and released it, which led to his nobility and prominence. Although the name is the same, the plot is different. Fortunately, the Old Dowager asked, otherwise they would have definitely regarded it as *Lei Feng Pagoda* or *Lan Chai Ji*. However, even the Old Dowager, who had watched operas for decades, did not know what the story was, which shows how obscure it was. The *Sheng Ping Shu Zhi Lüe* has *Chu Han Zhuan*. The note says: "Slightly the same as *Western Han Romance*." *Legend of the White Snake* is probably the first volume of *Chu Han Zhuan*. Twenty years ago, the Dan Gui First Stage and the Gong Wu Stage in Shanghai both rehearsed the serial opera *Emperor Gaozu of Han*. Most of those table operas, apart from current affairs dramas, were adapted from old versions. This *Emperor Gaozu of Han* is probably the *Chu Han Zhuan* recorded in *Sheng Ping Shu Zhi*. I remember that the first volume was precisely the story of slaying the white snake. If this guess is correct, then there should have been *Legend of the White Snake* first, and later the Southern Troupe adapted it based on it and added some miscellaneous dramas and legends telling the story of Emperor Gaozu to form *Chu Han Zhuan*, and finally it was changed to *pihuang* and performed outside.</p>
<p>In the 53rd chapter, the Old Dowager celebrates the Lantern Festival, saying:</p>
<p>Musk Moon and others asked, "What is she holding in her hand?" The daughter-in-laws said, "It is the food that the Old Dowager is rewarding with golden flowers to each young lady." Autumn Grain laughed and said: "The opera outside is singing *Eight Virtues*, but not *Hun Yuan He*. Where did the Golden Flower Goddess come from?"</p>
<p>Volume 40 of *Qu Hai Zong Mu* has *Hun Yuan He*. The summary says:</p>
<p>Made by recent people, absurd and unreliable, roughly imitating books such as *Feng Shen Yan Yi* and *Journey to the West*, concocted out of thin air to please the eyes and ears of the moment. The so-called "recent times" probably also refers to before Qianlong. *Hun Yuan He* also appeared in the mediocre category of one hundred and five kinds of opera lyrics in *Yangzhou Hua Fang Lu*. Chapter 4 of *Sheng Ping Zhi Lüe*, Section on Duanwu Performances, says:</p>
<p>For large-scale serial operas, there are</p>
<p>*Elucidating the Tao and Eliminating Evil* and *Hun Yuan He*. According to this, this opera also flowed from the folk into the imperial court. Item 37 of *Qing Bai Lei Chao*, Notes on Opera Performances in the Summer Palace, says:</p>
<p>Yu Runxian first arranged</p>
<p>and performed *Hun Yuan He*. All its</p>
<p>equipment was mostly borrowed from the Imperial Household. This item is unknown from which book it was recorded. Most of it plagiarized the Longevity section of *Yan Pu Za Ji* in the 21st year of Qianlong, using the events of the Qianlong years to talk about the liveliness of opera performances in the Summer Palace, which is ridiculous. However, at the end of the Qing Dynasty, *Hun Yuan He* flowed from the imperial court to the folk again, just like *Legend of the White Snake*. Other operas such as *Yan Men Guan* and *Wu Cai Yun* are also like this.</p>
<p>In summary, we can know that during the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods, *Yiyangqiang* was popular, and even families like the Jia household, that is, the Cao family, often performed it. After the Qianlong period, it successively entered the imperial court. Therefore, almost all the obscure operas in *Dream of the Red Chamber* can be found in the major Southern Troupe operas preserved by the Sheng Ping Shu. I have no research on the history of opera. I am only presenting some materials for conversation, but even these materials are well-known to everyone.</p>
<h3>On the Use of "余" in Stone Drum Inscriptions Instead of "朕"</h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Tong Shuye Again</p>
<p>The Stone Drum Inscriptions use "余" (I), '[　]' , and "我" (I), but not the character "朕" (royal I). I believe they should be dated after the Qin Gong Bell and Qin Gong Gui and close to the era of the Cursing Chu Texts. Recently, Mr. Tong Shuye, in his article "Another Question for Mr. Tang Lan on the Era of the Stone Drum Inscriptions" (see the Shanghai Central Daily News Cultural Relics Weekly, issue 77), put forward a novel opinion, saying:</p>
<p>The grammar of the Stone Drum Inscriptions is closer to the Eastern system, so it uses the character "吾" (I). It is not entirely the same as the characters used in other bronze inscriptions and can only prove that it is an Eastern dialect; it cannot prove that its era is late.</p>
<p>This is very worthy of attention. I very much agree that the character '[虞]' (I) is originally an Eastern language element, because it is the same as the situation with the character "也" (also). Now, Mr. Tong's new theory and my theory have finally found a common point. However, how could the Qin state's stone inscriptions use an Eastern dialect and also write it as "吾" (I)? Mr. Tong believes that "the Qin ethnicity originally came from the Huaiyi, also an Eastern ethnicity, so its script is also close to the Eastern system," but this is probably not necessarily the case. During the Warring States period, the six states used the ancient script, which was Eastern script. The Qin state used the Da Zhuan script and the Small Seal script, which were Western scripts. This kind of distinction did not happen suddenly. From the perspective of language, "吾" (I) is equivalent to '[虞]' (I), and "毆" is close to "也" (also), but from the perspective of script, the Qin state has always inherited the Western system.</p>
<p>I don't want to discuss the Qin ethnicity issue here. Even if the Qin state was selected from the East, it ultimately always resided in the northwestern land. From Qin Fei onwards until before Qin Zheng merged the six states, it was always a Western state. If it is said that the Qin state still preserved the Eastern language in its early days and wrote "虞" as '[　]' (I), then why did the bell and Gui of the time of Duke Jing of Qin use the character "朕" (royal I)? Why did the Cursing Chu Texts of the late Warring States period suddenly think of this "吾" (I) and not use "朕" (royal I)? This is probably impossible to explain forever.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Tong can say that the Eastern ethnicities also used the character "朕" (royal I). He cites the Qi Hou Bo bell with the Xue clan inscription as evidence. But I want to point out here that while the Qi Hou Bo bell and mirror used the character "朕" (royal I), they did not use the character '[　]' (I). The first-person pronouns they used were only the three characters "余" (I), "朕" (royal I), and "辝" (I), which is the same as the Qi Jiang Ding. However, the Qi Bo bell, which is also a bronze artifact from the Qi state, has the character '[　]' (I), but it does not have the character "朕" (royal I). It only has the three characters "余" (I), '[　]' (I), and '[　]' (I). This phenomenon is exactly the same as the Qin state's bronze and stone inscriptions. I wonder how Mr. Tong will explain it? Does the appearance of the character '[　]' (I) and the disappearance of the character "朕" (royal I) stem from dialect? From the era? Or is it a clever trick to say that the first two artifacts just happened not to need the character '[　]' (I), and the latter artifact just happened not to use the character "朕" (royal I)?</p>
<p>In our view, only the order of eras can explain it. The Qi Hou Bo bell, which uses the character "朕" (royal I), is a bronze artifact from the era of Duke Ling of Qi (581-554 BC), while the [　][　] which uses the character "　" (I), is later. This is a fact, and there is no need to insist. Having "朕" (royal I) but not '[習]' (I), having "吾" (I) then not having "朕" (royal I), this is my humble opinion. Mr. Tong is lavishly talking about "吾" (I) and "我" (I) being interchangeable. Isn't this missing the point entirely?</p>
<p>In short, whether in the East or West, from divination inscriptions to bronze inscriptions, the character "吾" (I) has never been used as a pronoun. This is undoubtedly a new language. During the Spring and Autumn period, the Shen Er Bell of the Xu state seems to be the first to use the character "　" (I). The Qi state still used the character "朕" (royal I) during the time of Duke Ling (the death of Duke Ling of Qi was in the 29th year of Duke Jing of Qin, two years before Confucius was born). Then, the adoption of the character "　" (I) should generally be dated to the late Spring and Autumn period. The 杕氏 Gui is undoubtedly a northern bronze artifact and also uses the character "　" (I). Its period is probably around the transition from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period. Looking again at the Qin state in the West, at least during the time of Duke Jing of Qin, it still only used the character "朕" (royal I), which was contemporary with Duke Ling of Qi. When this new language spread from the East to the West, the Qin people used a character derived from the sound of "吾" (I) to represent it, and that is how the "　" (I) of the Stone Drum Inscriptions of the early Warring States period and the "梧" (I) of the Cursing Chu Texts of the late Warring States period came about. By this time, the pronoun "朕" (royal I) was already a dead language. Therefore, the ancient saying used "朕" (royal I), and the new language used "吾" (I). In principle, these two pronouns do not overlap. We can infer that the disappearance of the character "朕" (royal I) and the popularity of the character "吾" (I) should have been around the transition from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period, based on the fact that the character "朕" (royal I) was still in use during the time of Duke Ling of Qi and Duke Jing of Qin, and that the character "吾" (I) was so prevalent after the Analects.</p>
<p>After the Warring States period, except for quotations from ancient books or ancient books compiled later that contain the character "朕" (royal I), it was generally no longer used. However, there are exceptions in the Chu Ci, where both "Li Sao" and "Zhao Hun" have the character "朕" (royal I). "Zhao Hun" only appears once, and it seems to be imitating "Li Sao," so it can be disregarded. The usage in "Li Sao" is the most peculiar. In addition to the three characters "余" (I), "吾" (I), and "我" (I), it not only adds "朕" (royal I) but also adds "予" (I), making a total of five first-person pronouns. I suspect this is the technique of the writer, for example:</p>
<p>"I am a descendant of the Emperor Gaoyang; My late father was called Boyong. When the conjunction of Sheti was in the first month, On the day of Gengyin I was born. He considered my destiny at the beginning, And bestowed upon me a fine name, Called me Zhengze, And styled me Lingjun."</p>
<p>There is a "朕" (royal I) in the front, an "吾" (I) character, and then four "余" (I) characters at the end. Again, such as:</p>
<p>"I regret that I did not carefully examine the road, I will delay and wait for a long time, I will return. Turn my chariot to return to the road, Before I go astray. I walk my horse on the orchid bank, And stop in the pepper hill. I will not enter and leave evil, And I will return to repair my old clothes." The grammar of "朕 chariot" and "余 horse" is the same, but the character "朕" (royal I) is used. Later, it says "屯 余 車 其 千 乘 兮," and only the character "余" (I) is used, which shows that he was just switching them around for the beauty of the writing. If it is believed that the ancient language still preserved this ancient language "朕" (royal I) at that time, then one would be greatly deceived by him.</p>
<p>In ancient standard speech, "余" (I) and "女" (you) are equivalent to the current "我" (I) and "你" (you), "朕" (royal I) and "乃" (your) are equivalent to "我的" (my) and "你的" (your), and "我" (we) and "爾" (you) are equivalent to "我們" (we/us) and "你們" (you), or "我們的" (our) and "你們的" (your). There are always exceptions. People today say "我們" (we/us), and sometimes it only represents "我" (I). Last time I said:</p>
<p>The first-person pronoun is almost the same as what Mr. Tong said, but the character "我" (I/we) seems to be used more often.</p>
<p>It was only a rough outline of the principle, not a discussion. Because the question of the majority or minority is originally outside the topic. The intention was only to indicate that I did not necessarily not know that the character "我" (I/we) is used in the plural. Whether the grammar is clearly understood or not is just a digression and has nothing to do with honor or disgrace. "Exclusively used" can be changed to "used more often," and "seems" was originally not a definitive conclusion. Mr. Tong's persistent arguing, even if there is a reason, is aimless. The original text is there and can be reviewed.</p>
<p>As for why Mr. Tong doesn't understand why I don't refute his proposed evidence that the Stone Drum Inscriptions are works from the early Eastern Zhou period, I have actually clearly stated that if my three pieces of evidence '[　]' (I), '[殹]' (end), and '[迂]' (bend) are completely untenable, then I must admit that my conclusion of moving the Stone Drum Inscriptions to the Warring States period is wrong. If one of them is tenable, then the claim that the Stone Drum Inscriptions are before Duke Jing is definitely wrong. The battle lines are clearly drawn. Why waste ink on other side issues? For example, Mr. Tong says that "the Qin state in the early Warring States period did not have any involvement with the Zhou Son of Heaven, so the inscriptions on Qin artifacts at that time would not need the Zhou Son of Heaven to embellish them at all." He does not seem to have flipped through the "Annals of Qin." In the twenty-first year of Duke Xian, the Son of Heaven congratulated him with [　][　]. In the second year of Duke Xiao, the Son of Heaven presented sacrificial meat. In the nineteenth year, the Son of Heaven presented the title of Earl. In the twentieth year, he paid homage to the Son of Heaven. In the second year of Lord Huiwen, the Son of Heaven congratulated him. In the fourth year, the Son of Heaven presented civilian and military rewards. These facts can prove that from the time of Duke Ling, the Qin state still needed the Zhou Son of Heaven to embellish them for another ninety years. It had already reached the mid-Warring States period. Soon, the Qin state itself claimed to be a kingdom.</p>
<p>Mr. Tong says that the character '[　]' (I) is used in the Stone Drum Inscriptions in fifteen places. I only thanked him last time for correcting it to fourteen places because one place does not follow "午" (noon) but follows "支" (branch) and is definitely not a pronoun. Since I had no intention of taking advantage of a gap or nitpicking, I changed it to fourteen places. It was neither a clerical error nor a printing error. I hereby declare this because it was mentioned.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>The Qianjiang Bridge began construction two or three years before the War of Resistance. I remember that when I crossed the Qianjiang River once before the war, I saw that the bridge foundations had a rough outline, but when I crossed the river again on the return trip, I saw that large foundation stones had been washed away by the river. The difficulty of the project can be seen from this. I heard that the project was only completed around the start of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, and it had been used by military vehicles a few times. It had never been open to civilian use. Not long after the War of Resistance, it was destroyed by enemy bombing. It was repaired and opened to traffic after the victory. The bridge is over 130 meters long and has two levels: the upper level is for cars and military vehicles, and the lower level is for the railway connecting the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. It looks neat and beautiful and is truly magnificent. I couldn't help but feel moved when I saw this bridge, and I felt that China had great hope. However, the railings on both sides of the bridge, except for the two ends, had not yet been repaired in the middle section. The pedestrian walkways were also a bit narrow. It is said that they will be widened soon. At that time, pedestrians will not have to take cars or ferries to reach the other side.</p>
<p>After crossing the Qiantang River, I transferred to a long-distance bus from Xiaoshan to Cao'e. This highway existed before the war, but it is still not very smooth, especially the section from the riverside to Shaoxing. Every time the bus crosses a bridge, it jumps greatly, just like the cyclical jumps in commodity prices. I just remember that during the War of Resistance, I heard that the highways in Guilin were even more uneven than this. It is said that when the car jumps on the uneven road surface, passengers are often jolted off their seats, up to a foot high, and their heads hit the roof of the car. Some passengers even have their teeth knocked out. Although the Xiaoshan-Cao'e highway can also cause passengers to be jolted off their seats, it does not cause passengers' heads to hit the roof of the car. In short, although the road surface is uneven, we can still consider it progress in transportation that we have these few highways, and we don't have to be overly demanding. Highway buses, like trains, also have reserved and unreserved seats. I think this point needs to be improved. It is necessary to implement reserved seating across the board.</p>
<p>Whether it is a train or a bus, wherever it goes, we can always see grave mounds. As far as the eye can see, there is almost no place without grave mounds. We can directly say that there is no clean land. I can't help but think: It's a pity that so much good land is occupied by dead people. Our country is known as an agricultural country, but the national food supply is probably mostly insufficient, so we often need to import food from foreign countries. If the government orders people to move the grave mounds and use this land to grow food, although we don't have precise statistics, it can be asserted that it would be of some help in increasing food production. Our people have always valued the corpses of the dead and also pay attention to so-called "feng shui," resulting in the strange phenomenon of grave mounds all over the country. I have not researched when the system of tombs began. However, according to Mencius, "In ancient times, coffins and outer coffins had no limits. In the middle ages, coffins were seven inches thick, and they were bound accordingly." This shows that things like "outer coffins" already existed when Mencius referred to "ancient times." Of course, at first it was "not just for beauty," but it was just a point for the living to "do their best." However, so many hundreds of thousands of years have passed, and so many people have died during that time. The land occupied by one grave and one outer coffin can only be calculated in square feet. It is not possible to concentrate the dead like skyscrapers in a city to form a cube. How much land do you think the dead have occupied from the living over the past thousands of years? Moreover, the living are continuing to increase. According to the population scholar Malthus, the population increases according to a geometric progression. If this is accurate, even without the dead, the living themselves will eventually fill the earth. Moreover, the living are the opposite of the dead, and the living will eventually become the dead. Since the living are increasing according to a geometric progression, the increase in the number of dead people is also naturally increasing according to a geometric progression. Based on this reasoning, if the living do not find ways to improve burial methods, one day the dead will make it so that the living have no place to stand when they are alive and no place to be buried when they are dead. However, our country has a tradition of respecting ancestors. If the government orders the people to move the graves in agricultural fields within a certain period of time, the public opinion will surely be in an uproar. But at least we can do this: we will not allow officials or commoners to use agricultural fields as burial grounds in the future. However, the people of our country are known for being exceptionally clever. I expect that when this order is issued, people will build new graves on agricultural fields, and the tombstones will definitely have inverted dates, calling them longevity fields. I remember that when the highway was being built before the war, there was a conflict between the highway and the graves, and it was impossible to have both. The tomb owners would spend money to make the highway turn; there were also cases where the highway and the graves did not conflict at all, but the road builders deliberately claimed that they would destroy the graves and build the road in order to extort money. Dealing with public affairs with this kind of attitude is discouraging.</p>
<p>When the bus passed through Shaoxing city, I repeatedly saw jar [　] piled up like mountains on both sides of the highway. It seems that this is also an important industry in Shaoxing. Although these large and small jars and [　] are not as delicate as Jiangxi porcelain in appearance, and their styles are not as beautiful as Jiangxi porcelain, they are both made of earth and used to hold things, which is what the two have in common. Personally, I like jars and porcelain more than porcelain. Although its exquisiteness is not as good as porcelain, its simplicity and rusticity surpass it, just like the rough-line style in certain novels. It has a different charm when you look at it.</p>
<p>Shaoxing wine is really good. The mellow and delicious taste cannot be described in detail without tasting it yourself. I have lived in Shanghai, a large commercial city, for so many years, and I have never drunk such good wine. The methods of brewing wine in various places must be the same, with no secrets. I guess it is mostly due to the different quality of rice. The rice in my hometown is really good. When cooked, it smells fragrant and tastes sweet, unlike the so-called "Du rice" or "thin rice" or "thick japonica" sold in rice shops in this city. It is already secondary that it tastes bland in the mouth. When chewing it, it seems that there is residue. Thinking about it, it is really better to return home.</p>
<h3>A Philosopher Afraid of His Wife</h3>
<p>— Xiang Wen</p>
<p>The great Greek philosopher Socrates was a very amiable person, but his wife, Xanthippe, was not only bad-tempered but also unable to understand him at all. Of course, there was even less talk of comfort and help. Therefore, he spent his time outside every day, talking and laughing with some young friends to relieve the depression at home.</p>
<p>One day, he played outside all day. When he came back, his wife was doing laundry. Seeing that he was playing outside every day, she was so angry that she cursed him. Still unable to calm down, she picked up the bucket of laundry water and poured it over his head, soaking him all over like a drowned chicken. But he was not angry at all and even smiled humorously, saying: "I know that after angry thunder, there must be a heavy rain."</p>
<h3>Eating in Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Mou Dunpei</p>
<p>"Dress in Chongqing, eat in Chengdu." These two sentences are easy to hear in Sichuan. Let's not talk about "Air in Chongqing" for now and talk about eating in Chengdu.</p>
<p>Anyone who has lived in Chengdu will know these slightly famous foods, especially the snacks. The variety is large and the reputation is high. From the beautiful dishes in grand restaurants with complete facilities to the simplest and most economical dandan noodles, each has its own special flavor.</p>
<p>Near Chunzhao North Road, there is a "Chicken Oil Lai Tangyuan." Perhaps some people are wondering why the character "赖" (Lai) is used as the brand name for tangyuan (sweet dumplings). In fact, many years ago, there was a person named Lai who opened a tangyuan shop. Because he had special skills, he attracted customer praise. It spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred. He actually became worth a hundred times as much, and admirers came in an endless stream. After the boss died, his descendants continued this profession and hung up the "Lai" Tangyuan sign.</p>
<p>Lai Tangyuan indeed has a special flavor. I have tried it several times. The storefront is not very large. There are only four square tables on the front, and there are two or three other tables next to the alley. The appearance of the tangyuan is not much different from other places. It is filled with black sesame, chicken oil, sugar, etc., and there is also a small bowl of sesame sauce to dip it in. However, it tastes very delicious and different from others. Every day, the place is always crowded. Especially in the morning, eaters line up in long queues like buying household rice, waiting for a seat. Even more people rush to eat its "name." I once asked a shop assistant: "Why do other people use the same ingredients, but it is not as delicious as yours?" The answer was: "Family secret recipe!"</p>
<p>"Wu Chaoshou"—Chaoshou is wonton, which was passed down by a person named Wu. The taste is wonderful, and the skin is made exquisitely. After being cooked, the meat inside the skin can be clearly seen, and the skin will not break. Because the business is booming, several branches have been opened, but according to experienced people, it is not as good as Wu Chaoshou.</p>
<p>"Mapo Tofu"—It can be seen at a glance that it is tofu made by a pockmarked woman. She doesn't use gypsum to make it, probably she uses [　]. It is said that her reputation dates back to the Three Kingdoms period, when Zhuge Liang sent a large army to northern Sichuan to defend against Cao Bing's invasion. When the team rested at the north gate of Chengdu, many soldiers went to find something to eat and discovered her [　][　] and swept it away. At that time, the weather was beautiful, and suddenly there was a heavy rain, preventing the march. The soldiers advertised it greatly for three days, so everyone knew about it. Because the proprietress was pockmarked, they named it that way. Mapo became very popular, and its fame continues to this day. The tofu shop is still open near the north gate.</p>
<h3>Willow Branch Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Bi [𧮯]</p>
<p>Ten miles of weeping willows reflect the hairpins, the southern regions have had good springs throughout history. On the warm-wind-sunny-day causeway, Wu girls tie up boats to watch plays.</p>
<p>White silk spring dress, jade bracelet around, eastern neighbor girls return from spring outing, small garden butterflies should remember, they once flew past willow catkins to brush against sideburns.</p>
<p>Do you remember when the golden [　] leaves were warm, red lanterns and crimson sleeves, dancing to spring words? Tonight, dream rains at Jialing Station, a tree of weeping willows, a cuckoo.</p>
<p>A thousand worries in the heart, forcing self-control, tears in the guest's eyes, known in dreams, the soul has already feared the shadow of the willow branches, a drizzle again for no reason.</p>
<p>Fallen flowers stir dreams indistinctly, faint red buildings in a line of rain, the most heart-wrenching is the end of the world, eastern wall willow leaves, northern wall [　].</p>
<p>Self-attracting the east wind without knowing it, apricot beam purple swallow delays the return date, weeping willows green all over the southern regions' road, a line of lovesickness, especially to give to whom?</p>
<p>How many times have I seen the spring breeze on the tips of the willows, Bai Men misty rain, how can I bear to throw it away! Pity the swallows returning, not recognizing the new mud as the old nest.</p>
<h3>Xu Wenchang on Disguise</h3>
<p>Nowadays, many tactics emphasize disguise. When fighting in green fields, one must wear grass-green clothing. Unexpectedly, Xu Wenchang of the Ming Dynasty also had a suggestion for disguise and surprise attack. In his draft of a letter to the Inspectorate, he said: "For those who are divided into ambush soldiers, they should be dressed in green clothes from head to toe, blending with the color of grass and trees, with only the eyes and ears exposed to see and hear, and with their mouths stuffed with gags to hide at night, so as not to make any noise." Also, in his draft of a letter to the Provincial Governor, he said: "One can send twenty strong men at night, with their mouths stuffed with gags, their heads and feet wrapped in green, blending with the color of the grass and plants, [　][　] come out of the deep seedlings, and cross the narrow waters."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the tactic of disguise is not copied from the West. It really existed in ancient times. (Hong Xian)</p>
<h3>Meteor</h3>
<p>— Jing Tao</p>
<p>Life is just like a meteor. It comes from chance and goes suddenly. Although it has flown across space, through the stars, and sometimes even happened to skim past the bright moon, when it descends to the end of the earth, it is just a meteorite, a speck of dust. It has no direct reaction to the earth, and what effect will it have on the vast and distant space? Perhaps only in the moment of its fall will it cause a few surprises and praises, but are these few praises for the meteor itself or for this spectacle of space? This is the mystery of life.</p>
<h3>The Harm of Adulterating Tung Oil in Cooking Oil</h3>
<p>— Shou Zhu</p>
<p>For several days, the newspapers have reported that Chen Zizhan, a Shanghai merchant, was holding a memorial service in Suzhou. The relatives and friends who participated were all poisoned because they ate vegetarian food. According to a doctor, this was caused by the adulteration of tung oil in cooking oil. Regarding this matter, I can prove the truth of his statement as follows:</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, I lived in Minhou. I made ink paste several times. At first, I used sesame oil, but later, because it was not easy to purchase, and according to old books, rapeseed oil was better than sesame oil, I changed to using rapeseed oil. At first, there was nothing unusual. Later, as transportation became more difficult and life became more expensive, the price of cooking oil rose endlessly. Although cooking oil is a daily necessity, there were very few operators due to its inconvenience [　]transport[　], and the profit was not very high. So, merchants came up with a strange idea: to mix tung oil into it. At that time, tung oil could not be exported, and the price dropped sharply. Using it to adulterate cooking oil could double the profit. If the amount of adulteration was not large, one would only feel that the oil was more viscous, and there would be no reaction after eating it. If it was adulterated more, it would not even be bright when used for lighting. After eating it, one would easily be poisoned, with symptoms such as dizziness and abdominal pain. Severe cases would involve vomiting and diarrhea, and it would take one or two days and nights to recover. However, if the oil was boiled a lot in the pot, or if the dishes were cooked a lot, one might be spared the harm. Therefore, people mostly did not suspect it.</p>
<p>One evening, I returned home from a social event. It was already dusk. As I was about to go to bed, all four members of my family complained of dizziness and abdominal pain and could not fall asleep. I suspected that the food was unclean or not cooked thoroughly, but after questioning them in detail about what they had eaten, there was no reason to cause illness. One daughter, because she ate a larger amount, vomited due to abdominal pain. Suspecting that there was poison in the oil, I angrily blamed the maid for not buying the oil carefully, which led to a big quarrel. But I said that there was absolutely no reason to be poisoned by cooking oil and strongly refuted their nonsense. The maid was only able to get out of bed the next day after having diarrhea. The others recovered overnight. In that place at that time, it was customary to specify that you were buying oil for eating when you bought oil, otherwise they would respond with lamp oil. Before long, a portion of the ink paste I made gradually hardened, and a thin film formed on the surface. The rapeseed oil I used to make the paste was purchased and refined in several batches. Thinking back to the previous incident, I began to suspect that tung oil might have been mixed into the cooking oil. However, I still did not dare to fully believe it and accuse people falsely. After several months, a friend invited me to do cooking oil business together. I declined, saying that this item was inconvenient to purchase and transport, and there was little profit to be made. The friend laughed and said, "You are really a fool. If you mix tung oil into it, the profit is greater than any other business." I was shocked and quickly told him about the previous incident and advised him not to be blinded by profit and disregard morality. The friend became wary and gave up.</p>
<p>Tung oil is a drying oil that can only be used for paint. It is toxic and cannot be eaten. Today, the price of cooking oil is high, and merchants are only interested in making profits, losing all conscience, [　][　] tung oil to ask for a good price. Their crime is no different from bandits. However, if prices continue to rise like this, then in the future [　] those who mix for the sake of high profits, I am afraid, will never cease.</p>
<h3>Saving Electricity</h3>
<p>— He Dao</p>
<p>A: "Why are you so depressed, my friend?"</p>
<p>B: "Alas, my wife went to the countryside for six weeks and came back today."</p>
<p>A: "Your wife returning home is a great thing, why are you so anxious?"</p>
<p>B: "Let me tell you the truth: When my wife was in the countryside, she often wrote to ask me if I was being honest and obedient, and following the rules. I wrote back to tell her that during these six weeks, I stayed at home every day and spent my time reading medicine and newspapers—but just as she entered the door today, the electricity company sent the bill for last month, saying that our household used a total of only one kilowatt-hour of electricity for the entire month."</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The several major elections and the power to draft the constitution in the early Republic belonged to the National Assembly. Although there were special election committees and constitutional drafting committees, the members of these special bodies were all elected from members of the two houses of the National Assembly. Thus, the authority of the National Assembly was limitless, and legislation virtually turned into a "supreme government," which was greatly contrary to the legal concept of the three branches of government standing on equal footing. At that time, this old fellow was busy with the life of a news reporter, dealing with the parliament and parliamentarians every day. One day, while chatting with a parliamentarian friend, I said, "You hundreds of 'Arhats' have boundless powers, managing everything, and supervising every organization. Who should supervise you? Or do you only manage others and not be managed by anyone, like 'Heavenly Kings and Enlightened Sages,' 'sacred and inviolable'?" This friend laughed and said, "Those who supervise the parliamentarians are only the news reporters. Their criticisms and scoldings are more free than the impeachment of officials by the parliamentarians. Reporters make fun of officials, and reporters also make fun of parliamentarians." His words were also true, but joking is not serious after all. National power should be balanced and not monopolized by one side. Therefore, although I am not a legalist, I cannot help but be skeptical. Now, elections and constitution-making are carried out by the National Assembly, a fundamental organization, which is separated from the Legislative Yuan. Impeachment is handled by the Control Yuan separately, which is clear and understandable, and much more progressive than the chaos of the past.</p>
<h3>Small Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Memories are like paintings, the clear ones are Western oil paintings with bright colors, and the vague ones are like lightly sketched Chinese landscapes.</p>
<p>A person who wants nothing is a person who fears nothing; because he fears nothing, he has a sense of pride, a pitiful, desolate pride.</p>
<h3>The Art of Living</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Ming</p>
<p>Living in a "foreign concession" where one cannot see a single bit of green for miles, it is truly difficult to talk about a spiritual life and its art that takes nature as its foundation and the return of the spirit as its goal, much like trying to do good in a yamen (government office), almost like searching with a hundred ropes and finding nothing. The techniques of the Barbizon school masters, who lived beside the secluded forests of green fields, are obviously different from the commodities in the bustling streets of Paris. Gauguin's main reason for leaving the tightly organized society and going to a desolate island in the South Seas to live his life, which was considered crazy, was also his aversion to this kind of living environment that destroyed the inch of clear light in his heart.</p>
<p>According to the above, does it mean that people who are imprisoned in cities have no right to engage in spiritual activities? If we affirm the true foundation of modern life, which should be built on a more extensive and in-depth spiritual activity than before, then the foreign concession where one cannot see a single bit of green for miles is not necessarily a suffocating hell. As long as you are good at utilizing it - proficient in the art of living, creating an artistic life - where can't you find beauty that deserves your amazement?</p>
<p>What is the art of living? It is to strive to pursue an artistic life. The former is the method, and the latter is the practice, but in essence, it is an inseparable whole. Every day, when you get a little free time, listen to a good piece of music, look at a good painting, or read a good poem or prose. Under the light of a five-candlepower electric lamp, a cup of bitter tea, and a cheap cigarette are enough to make you forget your troubles and enjoy the aftertaste of life. The next day, you will be very busy and work hard for food and clothing, but you will definitely be able to do it with twice the efficiency and pleasure. Because your life is not just selling time and labor, it is actually playing the most inexhaustible, the least troublesome, and the sweetest game in the world.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Ye Qiuyuan (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>On the morning of March 2nd, I was lying in bed reading the Shen Bao when I suddenly saw the news of Mr. Ye Qiuyuan's death. I almost didn't believe it was true, and I thought I was dreaming. Because I had received a phone call from Mrs. Ye last night, telling me: "Mr. Ye has recovered and been discharged from the hospital for three or four days. Because he received guests at home in the morning and talked too much, he felt quite tired, and his temperature suddenly increased again. To be cautious, he has been sent to the Gōngjì Hospital to stay for a few more days." After the phone hung up, Mr. Pan Gongzhan came to the office to read the editorial to be published tomorrow, and Mr. Chen Xunyou came to visit Mr. Pan for some matters. Walking past the editorial department, they both asked me about Mr. Ye's condition, and I repeated Mrs. Ye's words to them. Everyone didn't take it to heart. No one expected that in a short one or two hours, Mr. Ye would pass away.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Mr. Ye was not very long, but because I had been seeing him in the editorial office of the Shen Bao every day for the past two years, in addition to discussing the topics of editorials, we talked about everything, from top to bottom, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, so it can be said that we knew each other well enough. Mr. Ye claimed to be "naturally fond of plainness" during his lifetime. From his speech and demeanor, we can see that he was indeed a scholar who was "naturally fond of plainness." Not only did he not compete with the world, but he was also humble in everything. For example, last year, when the Legislative Yuan was being elected, I asked Mr. Ye several times whether he would participate. He always shook his head and said, "I have been a member of the Legislative Yuan for six or seven years, and I should also take a rest and let others be it!" Later, after encouragement from President Sun, he reluctantly registered. After being nominated by the political party, but after learning that the Beijing-Shanghai area had doubled the number of free elections, Mr. Ye decided to give up. Before he wrote a letter to declare his abandonment, I often advised him to discuss it with Mr. Pan Gongzhan, or he could help. However, when he met Mr. Pan, he never mentioned this matter, and the letter of abandonment of the election had already been sent. Later, Mr. Ye's vacancy was filled by Ms. Zheng Yuxiu. Outsiders who did not know the inside story made many unpleasant rumors, and even the Nanjing correspondent of ×× newspaper also said how Mr. Ye was, how he was. I was very angry when I read the newspaper, and I felt that the so-called "inside news" at the moment was nothing more than some "speculative words." That night, I met Mr. Ye and pointed out the ×× newspaper to him and advised him to write a letter to correct it. But Mr. Ye laughed after reading it. He said, "No matter what it says? As long as I haven't accepted bribes from others, why bother to correct it?" This kind of open and upright attitude was really touching. I wonder what the author who wrote this Nanjing correspondence will think after reading my text?</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they knew him or not, all those who knew Mr. Ye's articles and morality believed that Mr. Ye's death was not only a loss to the Shen Bao, but also a major loss to Chinese society. Mr. Ye was not only a famous reporter and political commentator, but also a religious figure and educator. Mr. Ye was born in Hangzhou in the thirty-second year of Guangxu (1906), and at the age of seventeen, he traveled across the ocean to study in the United States. After sixteen years, he obtained a Master of Arts in Political Science from Indiana University and returned to China. In addition to working as a reporter for the Shen Bao, he also served as a professor at Fudan University. The subjects he taught were sociology and anthropology, which seemed very inconsistent with his age. At that time, he was only twenty-one years old and was the youngest professor at Fudan University. Mixed in with a group of students, it was almost impossible to tell who was a student and who was a professor. Mr. Ye was a young man who "came out early," and perhaps the reason why he failed to enjoy his old age was because he made his debut too early!</p>
<p>Mr. Ye had a religious enthusiasm early on, and he was most likely to gain the love of students when he was with young students. According to Mr. Ye himself, the most gratifying thing in his life was in the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), when there was a student movement at China Public School, and the students rose up against Professor Luo Longji, forcing him to resign as the director of the Department of Political Economy. At that time, the vice president, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, found it difficult to decide on a successor, and finally hired Mr. Ye to succeed him. Mr. Ye was only twenty-seven years old at the time, but after he arrived at the school, the student movement subsided. Last year, when the Shanghai student movement was in a state of chaos, Mr. Ye often talked about how he dealt with students when he was in China Public School. Although students are different now than they were in the past, he was indeed able to deal with students in a way that was superior to others. Therefore, on the eve of his death, some people still advocated inviting Mr. Ye to go to the north to serve as the president of a certain university.</p>
