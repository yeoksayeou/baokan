<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：杜威頃宣佈放棄競選，將總統一職，讓與杜魯門當選。是時，杜魯門獲選　人票三〇四票，在廿六州中佔先；杜威僅獲一八九票，在十六州中領前。</p>
<p>杜威放棄競選之消息傳至坎薩斯城後，杜魯門面露笑容，並吻其弟。杜魯門此次勝利，造成二十世紀政治之奇蹟，完全出乎意外，卽杜威及其週圍人物亦未料及。又，此次不特杜魯門獲得勝利，民主黨且已控制國會，因此，美國對外政策之擬訂，社魯門將有更多之權力。</p>
<p>又訊：杜威頃致電杜魯門，向其道賀，電云：「閣下連任總統，可喜可賀，謹祝前途成功。余並籲請所有美國人民，團繪一致，支持閣下維護美國之自由與强大，並建立仳界和平。」（請參閱第三版）</p>

<p>哈雷·杜魯門一八八四年五月八日生於密蘇里州的拉瑪城，他少年時代在農塲上消磨了不少年月，所以他這次在競選時，很得農民的好感。</p>
<p>靑年時代的杜魯門曾經做過各種行業，第一次大戰中，他從軍担任砲隊上尉，在戰塲出死入生，使他了解「中產階級」的態度與需要。</p>
<p>杜魯鬥的第一次政治生涯是在一九二二年十一月，那日他當選爲康州席克遜領法官。一九三四年當選參議員，一九四〇年再度當選，在第二次大戰期內，他主張成立「調查全國防衛計劃委員會。」建議當卽通過，他當仁不讓出任主席，博得了全國盛譽，和羅斯福的靑睞。後來羅斯福蟬聯第六屆總統，杜魯門亦躍登副總統寳座</p>
<p>一九四四年四月十二日下午羅斯福突然中風逝世，杜魯門維任總統。</p>
<p>在白宮第一年中杜魯門深得民心，聯合國憲章在舊金山通過了，戰爭勝利了，戰後的復興事業開始了。</p>
<p>一九四六年杜魯門遇到許多新困難，國會兩議院入於共和黨的掌握。</p>
<p>民主黨全國大會卒於今年六月十五日早晨在費城提名杜魯門做本屆總統候選人。</p>

<h3 id="c24">注意東京裁判的宣判 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>歷時二十三個又半月的東京裁判，自審理終結以後，舉世輿論期待日本戰犯罪行的宣吿，準備作最後的公正的評價。近據盟國消息：遠東國際軍事法庭的宣判書業已草竣，一俟翻譯工作完成，卽行宣判，時間約在本月中旬。又據東京「朝日新聞」華府電訊的預測：大概會被宣吿死刑的，爲東條英機，武藤章，鈴木貞一，島田繁太郎，板垣征四郎，土肥原及其他六名，共計十二名；被宣告無罪的，爲重光葵，梅津美治郎，賀屋興宣三名；畑俊六則在死刑與無罪之間，大槪被判拘役，南次郎和松井石根則大約被處禁錮。如果這個推測不錯，則日本戰犯的處決，仍未充分達到公平的合理的標準。</p>
<p>懲罰戰犯，是二次世界大戰結束後的一件大事；遠東國際軍事法庭的設立，是繼紐倫堡國際軍事法庭之後，審理甲級戰犯的負責機構，通稱東京裁判。遠東法庭於一九四六年四月廿九日對東條廣田等廿八名（現只有廿五名）甲級戰犯提起公訴，歷時二年餘，到本年四月十六日始吿審理完結，直到現在還沒有宣判，這完全說明二年餘來一貫的遲緩和鬆懈，是深爲遺憾的事。誠如我國法官梅汝璈所說：「余確已覺察鑒於過去二年來世界情勢之急劇變化，東京栽判，巳失去其政治上之大部意義，但余深望不致失去其在法律上及歷史上意義。」這是很有卓見的一種預知，比之紐倫堡的審判納粹，不可忽略的東京裁判在法律上政治上的意義已經削弱了，僅留下若干歷史陳跡供後世憑弔吧了。</p>
<p>從法律上說，遠東國際軍事法庭採用的審理制度，是非常周密而合乎理想的，但刑罪的最後決定及其執行，須由最高統帥（指麥克阿瑟）以命令行之，是不合理的。依照規定：最高統帥對於法庭所宣判的刑罰，得隨時予以减輕，或加以其他的變更，但不得加重；這無異是說法庭的判決，尙非最後的判決卽執行，而須經最高統帥的核准才能執行。現在的甲級戰犯有廿五名，預測中將判處死刑的，僅有東條等十二名，將被禁錮的有南次郎松井，其他均在有罪與無罪之間，彈性甚大。以目前麥帥對裁判一事的冷淡態度來看，卽使法庭宣判死刑或禁鋼的，將來是否會减輕其刑罰，或延緩其執行，頗有疑問。所以說，東京裁判的形式是周密而理想，合乎學理價値，實則東京栽判的本質，是採取軍事獨裁的裁決制，意識可以變更法律，命令可以變更法律。不僅戰犯等的死亡，卽法律的尊嚴神聖，也都寄託在麥帥最後的一轉念間。因此，我們對於東京裁判卽將宣判的結果，尙不便作過早的樂觀。</p>
<p>從政治上說，戰爭罪犯的懲罰，是要巷人間後世建立一個原則，即「侵略戰爭是犯罪，它不單是對於戰犯加予死刑的懲罰，而且具有預防戰爭的警惕意義。從甲級戰犯廿五名的身份和地位股，以及彼鹽在織爭中廣負的政治寶任設，毫無疑義的，彼　都是戰爭的侵略者，即免訴中的大川周明，也逃脫不了侵略罪實。預測中將被宣吿無罪的重光　，乃侵略的外交家縱橫家，曾任「大東亞省」大臣，策劃侵略事宜，他的罪行同廣田弘毅一樣，應受死刑的宣告。梅津美治郎乃侵略中國的戰犯，他於關東軍司令官任內，逼迫中國簽訂區域協定，蠶食冀東，侵略華北，他的罪行同土肥原一樣，應受死刑的宣告·貿墨興宣乃侵略內閣的財相，侵略戰爭的計劃者，他幷且是財閥與軍閥的橋樑，他任「華北關發公司」總裁，夷中國於奴隸地位，他的罪行同鈴木貞一一樣，應受死刑的宣吿。畑俊六曾任侵略內閣的睦相，及華中派遣軍最高指揮官，他領率大軍侵略華北及西南，他的罪行同坂垣征四郎一樣，應受死刑的宣吿。南次郎總管朝鮮，曾任關東軍司令部，侵略東北；松井石根在華中軍最高指揮官任內，屠殺南京，造成侵略戰爭人間最犬的悲劇，無論如何是應受死刑的宣吿。彼輩的罪行，不僅在法律上應受死刑的宣吿，幷且在政治上不能减輕或緩刑，否則東京裁判的政治意義完全喪失了。</p>
<p>總之，東京裁判已至最後關頭，舉世輿論寄深切的注意，特別是中國人民，受日本軍閥侵略的逼害最深，故對審判的結果，愈感無限的關切與注意。今天盟總對於東京裁判的冷淡態度，是萬分可憂的；我們希望盟國政府與盟國人士，一致爲公理正義而主張，迅速將這一干戰犯的罪行，早日宣吿世界，從嚴懲處，爲世界樹立祥和，爲人類伸張正義，這是我們對東京裁判的願望。</p>

<p>〔本報紐約十月廿七日航訊〕紐約寓公孔祥熙氏，曾對紐約總領事張平羣表示：渠以至誠擁護中央幣制改革新方案，如果紐約方面，機構組織就緒，辦法擬訂週密，則孔氏願首先登記在美資產，爲僑界倡。惟孔氏拒絕接受張總領事之聘請，担任資產登記之指導委員。</p>
<p>據張總領事對記者談：指導委員會原計劃由五人組織之。除總領事外，張平羣曾邀請孔祥熙及李國欽兩氏，惟兩氏均堅決拒絕，故『委員會』迄今尙未能成立。張氏認爲登記海外存款之最大困難，爲紐約州法律之限制，（按美國法律，各州不同），紐約州法律規定，任何外國銀行，一槪不得收受存款及經營存款業務，紐約中國銀行多年以來，祗管匯兌，不收存款，卽爲是故。而張平羣氏認爲：政府辦理海外資產登記，目的原在增强政府之外匯準備，並備必要時之徵借調度之用，若紐約中行不能收受存款，所有紐約國人資產，仍存放於美國銀行手中，則「縱令一紙公文，登記數字，又有何用？」是以張總領事認爲今日最急要之步驟，爲透過中央政府與華盛頓之交涉，或透過大使館與美國國務院之交涉，使美國能開放紐約中國銀行收受存款之限制。</p>
<p>張總領事尙談及：李國欽氏對政府資產登記法令亦一再表示擁護，惟李氏亦有其事實上之困難，蓋李爲紐約鉅商，其資產經常在調度週轉之中，李本人固有存款，但同時亦有欠款，是卽會計學上所謂『資產」「負債」是也，李國欽氏一再明白表示，若政府欲渠登記資產，渠亦必同時登記負債。張總領事認爲此種情形，除李國欽外，同樣者不乏其人，當爲執行政令時之又一困難。</p>
<p>第三困難，張總領事認爲係「華僑」一字之解釋，對於雙重國籍之美國華喬公民　如何辦理？此項困難，月前王雲五部長過紐約時，曾於記者招待會上討論及之，王部長認爲尙須審愼硏究。至於前兩項困難，張總領事曾詳吿王部長，並請政府再事研究。</p>
<p>張平羣對本報記者稱：渠對政令，決認眞奉行，決無推諉怠忽之處。惟美國爲一極端自由主義之國家，政府無特別之治外法權，可以干涉或管理國人之行動，尤不能千涉任何私人之經濟生活，此種環境，國內大部份人士早甚明瞭，張氏希望能假以時日，愼妥辦理，當能有所成就。</p>

<p>食米到貨寥寥，昨日南北二市共到一千〇四十六石，內以米號自辦自銷者居多，行家到貨甚少，故市塲無貨供應，米號需股，市勢極俏，現貨未開出，聞十天交貨，路貨粳米做開價九十五元，市勢上挺。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>正式議價未定，廠方未有應市，故交易無貨做開。聞雜牌粉喊價四十元，麩皮鄕需孔急，價再上漲，大包麩挺六元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>交易，日見興旺，黃豆到少，頗感缺貨，漢口乍豆六十元，鄱陽黃豆六十五元，計漲十元。苞米北帮反進爲出，價格下降三元，紅糧削四五元，元麥缸豆均見疲落，芝蔴交易轉活，生仁價格彷彿。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>供不應求，熟菜油漲五元至十元，但尙不敷分配，後由廠商聯合開售，豆油及生菜油約三千担，價一律一九〇元，江北凈生油亦開出，價二三八元，中植廠不領導開售，殊使油源不足。蔴油未開。豆餅貨稀，餘記餅二十五元，計挺二元五角。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕南北米市塲昨到貨共千餘石，無正式交易做開。南市塲於交易時間內，有山西路一〇二號丁義昌米號，以一百十圓價拋售江西秈米七十石，由大興街六號源昌買進二十石，露香園路智安里五號祥茂買進五十石。社會局駐塲人員以其有抬價嫌疑，報局請示後，當將丁義昌米號經理丁祥麟扣押，移送警局，後經元大號保釋隨傳隨到。</p>
<p>據社會局吳局長表示：依米市塲規則，米號係向市塲買進轉售市民，今丁義昌米號反於市塲拋售，且喊價至一百十圓，較上日驟增二十圓，顯有故意抬價嫌疑。食糧雖已准自由買賣，但操縱居奇行爲仍將取締，該案如何處置，將報請吳市長核辦。</p>

<p>小提琴聖手　馬思聰　在杭州  本報特派員　儲裕生　　〔本報杭州三日訊〕思聰兄是民國廿五年和太太來過杭州遊覽，沒有舉行演奏，算來已是十二個年頭了。闊別的湖山，闊別的友情，該是分外的親切與興奮，尤其他們是在上海十餘演奏下來以後，正可在這秋高氣爽的西子湖畔休憇休憇。但是爲了鼓動杭州市的音樂氣氛，爲了杭州市愛好音樂者得着聆賞的機會，在相互傾吐離裏中，我又有在杭市演奏數塲的請求，他倆也終於答應了下來。　　閒話杭州北平　　他對於杭州的湖山很喜愛，他說與自然多多接近是好的，與人民多多接近是必要的。他也同意，像杭州這樣美麗的山湖，應該成爲文化城的，思聰兄嫌她太柔媚，但到六和塔一看，他又改變了他的口氣。不過，他還覺得杭州的一切建築氣魄要比北平差，因爲北平顯得很偉大雄壯，我說北平之成爲文化城，多多少少因襲着封建的遺蔭，我說我們要建立一個眞正人民所有的文化城。於是我們傾談到中國的文化，唐以前，差不多中國的一切藝術文化被普及於民間的，唐以後，尤其是宋以後，文化爲帝皇所有，子民百姓不能亨受文化所賜予的幸福，所以我們自唐以後，着着退步，而歐美各國都有了顯著的進步了。　　出席文藝晚會　　十月廿五日，思聰兄和他的太太出席了我們所主持的歡迎文藝晚會，這已是我們所舉行的第五次文藝晚會了。思聰兄沒有說話，是以提琴的聲音來代替他的說話，當他奏動琴絃，一聲聲緊扣聽衆的心絃，使聽衆爲他的聲音所引動感情，繼而悠然神往。當他鳴奏完畢，聽衆們回復了常態，追溯已經神往的意境，不禁叫好不絕，要求「再來一個」！　　茶會熱烈招待　　廿六日是出席老畫家林風眠先生熱烈招待的茶會，林先生約的盡是許多藝士畫人。多謝林先生的親戚奧人卡馬先生，他把他收藏的名樂曲演奏家的唱片一再鳴唱，使我們面對今天我們中國的小提琴家作着無窮的期望。廿七日是空校的演奏會，『西藏音詩』，祖國的聲音吿訴祖國的空中勇士們，您們應該熱愛這廣闊的家園。廿八日是藝專的歡迎演奏會，在這個集會上，竺可楨校長談到以音樂來感化戰亂的氣氛。　　自己的演奏會　　廿九，卅，卅一，這三天是他自己的着　會，地點在外西湖的藝專，那裏需要通過白堤，如果從下城到藝專要三公里的路程，但是成千成百的愛好音樂者，莫不瘋狂一般的前往聆樂，那深秋夜晚靜寂的白堤上，驟然變得活潑熱鬧。　　眞是攪動了杭州荒蕪的樂壇，各個學校團體紛紛請求演奏。十一月一日到浙大，二日到之大，三日到浙贛路局，總計這次思聰兄在杭州獲得了萬餘聽衆的擁護。　　思聰兄不但是演奏家，而且是作曲者，他吿訴我，不久他做的「春天大合唱」要出版了。我祝福他永遠地努力，因爲音樂是自然的歌唱，是詩，是最眞實的聲音，是人民的謳歌。馬思聰夫婦任靈隱大殿前留影　（虞士揮攝·右第一人爲本報特派員儲裕生）京槍殺豫流亡學生案　主犯王慶蘭被提公訴　　〔本報南京三日電〕京建康路雜貨店老闆王慶蘭槍傷河南流亡學生致死案，主犯王慶蘭地檢處已依殺人及公共危險罪提起公訴，起訴檢察官要求刑庭依刑法廿三條之規定請處，因王之行爲頗接近爲正當防衛之意義，因而檢察官論及之。各地食米議價　　〔本報崑山三日電〕自經濟改革補充辦法公佈後，當局已決定食米自由賣買，其議價標準，不得高於錫常等縣，城鄉檢查站，已全部撤銷。本（三）日米市有成交，白粳每石七十五元。又訊：本年度田賦，已於一日全面啓征，每賦元連捐獻在內，共征稻穀三斗六升。　　〔本報嘉與二日訊〕限價開放，各業商均於一日，由各業公會按照成本，加以利潤，議定新價，二日起米油等重要物品，經縣長答應照新價發售，門售食米白粳，冬雙，壬尖每石各七十八元，河南尖，糯米各七十五元，菜油每斤一元九角，其餘部份因未得滬杭各地同業之價目，致未議價目，定二日議定後呈報縣府核備實行。　　〔本報松江二日訊〕據商會消息：各項日用必需品價格，巳請由徐縣長面諭，依照八一九限價連本三倍，俟評價會決定再行調整。其他各種物品，得由各業自由合理調整，報縣備查·現在各業物價，漲風瀰漫，紛亂之狀，達於極點。袖珍新聞　　鎭江　　〔本報訊〕鎭江經檢組前舉行全市總檢查時封存之江蘇農民銀行所購米稻一千七百餘石，上海振興公司購存米稻一千五百五十石，山東齊魯公司所購小麥二千零六十二包，經省物資調節委員會第二次會議議決不予發還，米稻交由鎭江物資調節處辦理配售，小麥交鎭江麵粉廠製麵配售，以濟民食，以上物資均於二日由物調處及麵粉廠分別接管。　　無錫　　〔本報訊〕鄕區五十九鄕鎭，於一日起，舉行戶口總檢查，將未發之國民身份證，一律限十天內發竣。　　南通　　〔本報訊〕第一綏區南通指揮所爲配合經管政策，並便利軍人眷屬購買日用品，在全面戶口配給未實施前，特訂軍人眷屬購買日用品臨時管理辦法，計分：大米，炊草，食油及肉等四種，由軍民合作站洽同公會指定地點配售，同時並嚴禁軍人擅自搶購，以維市上秩序。　　金華　　〔本報訊〕浙省八區保安司令部頃決定具體辦法，獎勵殺匪及毛匪自新投誠，凡活擒或格殺匪首者，賞稻穀二百担，毛匪自動携械投誠者，統予優待，携歸輕機槍一支，獎五百金圓，步槍一百金圓，木壳槍二百金圓，聞該項辦法公佈後，匪徒頗多覺悟，現正接洽中。蘇南報聯會　定六日在錫開會　　〔本報無錫二日訊〕蘇南報業聯誼會，定六日下午一時起，假西鄉梅園開年會，由邑中日報業公會，招待遊覽名勝，並由縣政府，參議會，縣商會等設宴招待各出席代表。黃橋警分局長　朱象賢已拘案　　〔本報泰興三日電〕黃橋警察分局長朱象賢，前被該局員警控訴有會汚凟職等罪行，已於二日拘案送縣。揚駐軍槍決強姦犯　　〔本報江都三日電〕駐揚第某軍軍部，二日晨槍決便衣分隊長張德隆一名。緣張犯曾於本年八月十二日在寳應防地，勾結地痞徐大龍，對被查獲無身份證之婦女共同强姦，經訊明屬實，呈奉國防部核准後執行。遠東橱窗　新擺設  謝銘新　　〔香港一日航訊〕如果拿第二次世界大戰中的歐洲，來比擬今天內戰烽火中的中國，那末，香港的地位與處境，恰如當時國際間諜們鈎心鬥角的葡萄牙京城里斯本。　　這大英帝國在遠東的櫥窗，目前已變爲走私的大本營，政治犯的收容所了。　　以貪污嫌疑被捕的前郵匯局長徐繼莊，迄今尙未引渡給中國政府，原因是徐的供詞，巳把重心移轉到「反對政府」去了。這種搪塞香港法庭質詢的遁辭，無非是假借『政治犯』的名目，讓號稱民主政治的英國來保護他，不將他交給中國政府，以免一死而已。　　最近此間盛傳蔡廷鍇章伯鈞等赴赤都哈爾濱，參加中共主持的「新政協會議」。次日，左翼機關報華商報，對此隻字不提，新華通訊社也毫無報導。蔡的老上司李濟琛將軍，拒絕接見各報社的新聞記者，若無其事的樣子。實際上，章伯鈞，蔡廷鍇輩早就潛赴澳門，設法領取出生證，以葡萄牙人的身份，由蘇聯領事館簽署，來搭乘蘇聯控制下的商輪，先赴北韓，再轉道入東北境界，現已抵達哈爾濱。聽說這會議並非正式的「新政協會議」，而是「新政協籌備會議」。　　留港左翼文人，除茅盾，夏衍等能以寫稿安排生活外，大抵無法解決職業與生活兩大問題，因爲香港雖然號稱小型政治中心，文化堡壘，但香港的實權握在英國人手裏，香港的經濟力量又祗在工商界方面。對文化人的容納與消化量，是極有限的。香港銷路最好的報紙是成報，一張典型的黃色小報，最適合香港小市民們的口味，在茶後酒餘最合適的消遣讀物。其次，才捱着歷史悠久的華僑日報，它在香港的地位是同上海的申新兩報相仿，以商人爲主要對象，廣吿多，篇幅多，張數最多。政學系主辦的大公報，新近遷港復刊的文匯報以及胡文虎財團的星島日報，在銷數上數字比較接近。　　香港眞正的重點，決不是政治和文化，而是它在商業上的地位。它對中國國際貿易的影響，它對中國金融市塲的關聯，都是非常密切而有極大關係的。香港的金融黑市，能擾動整個的中國金融市塲，儘管你官方禁止黑市港幣金圓劵的套匯，而事實上經營的，依舊大有人在。十月份起，申匯交易，又復猖獗，這當然與濟南戰局和上海搶購潮有關，而上海當局不開放進口，使有充份物資存底，造成有市無貨的僵局，也是失策。　　雖然香港號稱「自由貿易港」，可是，這東方的商埠，又給若干大英法律條例重重束縛住了。舉例言之：帶黃金外幣入口，必須事先申報，否則沒收，許多華僑因不明此種硬性規定，便吃了很大的虧。又如貨物出口，亦須申請結匯，這也給正當商人招致麻煩不少。貨物進口，也得申請許可。此外，苛細的條文判例，又多得呌老香港人，甚至法官都摸不着頭腦，這就是香港的「法治」。　　香港目前人數，快近一百萬了，房荒，食糧必需靠廣州等地的供給，生活費用可算全世界最高的了，但香港的居民，倒是頂會找玩意，頂會消遣，卽使家中三餐不飽，女人的漂亮旗袍和美國化妝品，一定是要的，男人還得穿上畢挺的西裝，電影或聽粵劇也得享受一番，一切都要撑門面，尙虛偽，香港人，可算得上最喜歡面子的人民。　　桃色案件，强姦案件，自殺案件，走私案件，欺詐案件，成爲當地法院的每日例行公事，這正象徵香港社會的畸形繁榮及其沒落的必然性。社會服務請投書讀者注意　　在最近的讀者諮詢函中，我們發現二種現象：　　（一）一部份讀者在來函中，不願將自己的眞實姓名和地址寫出來，而往往用「一讀者」，「一市民」或其他筆名。這樣一來，使我們的服務工作遭受到不少的妨碍。　　（二）一部份的「意見」和「呼籲」函件，都沒有確切的負責人簽名蓋章，甚或沒有具體事實。對於這些函件，我們實在無法辦理。　　今後我們希望來函請詢的讀者，能够將他們的眞實姓名和詳細地址吿訴我們，使我們减少處理「無頭案」的麻煩。同時，也可使終日辛勞的綠衣人不因『該處並無此人一的「迷途信件」而多跑寃枉路。我們竭誠爲讀者服務，在這裏希望讀者多多協助。徵求人才　　中華職業教育社上海職業指導所，近受各方委託，物色下列各項人才，凡願應徵者，卽請往雁蕩路八十號該所面洽。　　（一）某處主任秘書一人，以具有新舊文學根底之男性爲合格。　　（二）某廠職員一人，以高級機械科畢業並有經騐者爲合格。　　（三）某事務所女打字員一人，以擅長萬能式華文打字者爲合格。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch] New York, 3rd (Radio): Dewey has just announced his withdrawal from the election, conceding the presidency to Truman. At that time, Truman had secured 304 electoral votes, leading in 26 states; Dewey had only 189 votes, leading in 16 states.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news of Dewey's withdrawal in Kansas City, Truman smiled and kissed his brother. Truman's victory this time is a political miracle of the 20th century, completely unexpected; even Dewey and those around him did not anticipate it. Moreover, not only did Truman win, but the Democratic Party has also gained control of Congress. Therefore, Truman will have more power in formulating U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: Dewey has just sent a telegram to Truman congratulating him. The telegram reads: "Congratulations on your re-election as President. I wish you every success in the future. I also urge all American people to unite and support you in safeguarding America's freedom and strength, and in establishing world peace." (Please see Page 3)</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Brief Biography of Truman <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Harry Truman was born in Lamar, Missouri, on May 8, 1884. He spent many years of his youth on farms, which is why he gained the favor of farmers during his campaign.</p>
<p>In his youth, Truman worked in various industries. During World War I, he served as a captain in an artillery unit, experiencing life and death on the battlefield, which helped him understand the attitudes and needs of the "middle class."</p>
<p>Truman's first political career began in November 1922 when he was elected judge of the Jackson County Court. In 1934, he was elected senator, and again in 1940. During World War II, he advocated for the establishment of a "Committee Investigating the National Defense Program." The proposal was immediately passed, and he took office as chairman, earning national acclaim and the favor of Roosevelt. Later, when Roosevelt was re-elected for his sixth term, Truman also ascended to the vice presidency.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 12, 1945, Roosevelt suddenly died of a stroke, and Truman became president.</p>
<p>In his first year in the White House, Truman won popular support. The United Nations Charter was passed in San Francisco, the war was won, and the post-war reconstruction began.</p>
<p>In 1946, Truman encountered many new difficulties, and both houses of Congress fell under the control of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The Democratic National Convention finally nominated Truman as the presidential candidate for this term on the morning of June 15 of this year in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Barkley's Brief History <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Alben W. Barkley, the newly elected Vice President of the United States, is a veteran politician in the Democratic Party, born in Graves County, Kentucky, in 1877. Before being elected, he was a senator from Kentucky. Barkley graduated from the law school of the University of Virginia. In 1901, he became a lawyer. From 1905 to 1909, he served as the county attorney for McCracken County, Kentucky, and later was appointed as a county judge until he was elected as a member of the 63rd Congress, at which point he resigned. In 1927, he was elected as a senator from Kentucky, and has been re-elected ever since. Since 1937, Barkley has served as the majority leader in the Senate. In the 1932 and 1936 elections, he served as the temporary chairman of the Democratic National Convention; in the 1940 convention, he served as the permanent chairman.</p>
<p>Although Barkley is 70 years old this year, he is energetic and humorous, and is highly respected in the Senate. His wife is named Dorothy Brower, and they have three children.</p>

The content vaguely states "In view of the difficulties of the current situation, having accomplished nothing, we request to resign and give way to more capable individuals," etc. This decision was discussed and approved at the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd. Weng Wenhao and Wang Yunwu were both extremely firm in their intention to resign. Weng originally intended for it to be his personal resignation, but all the political members believed that the responsibility of the cabinet should be shared, so it was decided to resign en masse. Wang Yunwu did not even attend the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] It has been decided that the remuneration for military and civil service personnel will be adjusted starting from November, with the adjustment being an increase of 150% based on the October standard.

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The adjusted prices for postal and telecommunications and railway passenger and freight rates, based on the Supplementary Measures for Economic Reform, were passed at the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd. Except for postal and telecommunications, which will be implemented on a scheduled basis after being passed by the Legislative Yuan, the new electricity rates and railway passenger and freight rates will all be implemented on the 6th. The prices passed on the 3rd are as follows: Postal: First-class mail, 10 cents, and so on. Telecommunications: 40 cents per word, and so on. Railway passenger transport will be increased by five times the current price, while freight transport will be less. In particular, the freight rates for daily necessities such as food, sugar, coal, salt, and oil will be calculated at 80%.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already drafted the electricity rate adjustment measures. The adjustment of electricity rates in various parts of the country will be implemented from November 1st. The standard will still be based on the past electricity rate increase calculation formula, adjusting based on fuel costs and operating expenses. The country will be divided into two parts: in areas that have not implemented economic controls in the past, the adjustment will be based on the coal prices and commodity prices in each area, according to the calculation formula. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has now telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments to provide price data. In areas that have implemented economic controls in the past, the coal price must be approved by the government. The number of electricity rate adjustments will be determined after the Bituminous Coal Adjustment Committee approves the coal price.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from this City] John Leighton Stuart, the Director of the ECA China Mission, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States tonight (the 4th). Stuart left China on October 10, and he has consulted with President Truman and ECA Administrator Hoffman in the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] The New York Times published a report from its San Francisco correspondent on the front page today under a two-line headline regarding Stuart's remarks on November 1st: "ECA China Mission Director Urges Us to Fully Assist China." Stuart also suggested revising the U.S. policy towards China today, saying, "Our middle-ground policy is not achieving any success." He then advocated that we should provide definite assistance, control the aid funds, and assume full responsibility for the use of the funds in economic and military aspects. He continued, "The situation is increasingly unfavorable for the Chinese government. Since June, the overall situation has deteriorated." Stuart also said that actively assisting China so that it does not fall into the hands of the Communists is in America's interest. "I do not believe that abandoning China is in America's best interest. China (especially North China) is the most important part of Asia. We are currently blocking the Iron Curtain in Korea, so it is logical to allocate a considerable amount of ECA funds to resist the Iron Curtain throughout the Pacific, just as in the Atlantic." Stuart also said that the best opportunity to avoid a hot war is to spend money on the "Cold War" to help people who are willing to resist totalitarianism. He concluded, "I am not saying that every Chinese Communist soldier is a follower of Marx, but the leadership of the CCP is in step with Moscow."</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Cleveland, the Director of the ECA China Aid Program, is expected to return to ECA headquarters within the week. He will report on his investigation of the ECA's work in China.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. Representative and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Walter Judd declared on the 3rd that the fall of the Northeast is a replay of the Pearl Harbor incident and has become "the most serious danger" to U.S. security. The failure of the Chinese government also threatens the security of anti-communist countries in the Pacific and Europe. He predicted that if the Soviet Union controls the entire China through the Communists, the United States must increase its expenditures by billions of dollars to "defend Alaska," maintain the independence of the Philippines, and protect the freedom of Japan. Judd said that if the Communists continue to be rampant in the East, the Soviet Union will be able to concentrate its efforts on a major offensive. He severely criticized Marshall and the State Department's policies for China's perilous situation.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] According to General David Barr, commander of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, there are 575 dependents of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Nanjing and 321 in Shanghai. Difficulties seem inevitable this winter. One hundred people will return to the United States in the near future. More people will also leave China when regularly scheduled military transport ships are available, but there is no need to send special ships. All those returning home, except for those whose terms have expired, are doing so voluntarily and are not being evacuated. Due to the current turbulent situation, there is a shortage of housing, fuel, and other necessities. No more dependents of the Advisory Group will come to China in the future.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a plenary meeting on the 3rd to broadly discuss the Sino-U.S. relations issue within the "Review of Diplomatic Policy" case. Rong Xi chaired the meeting, and the committee members spoke enthusiastically. It was generally believed that Sino-U.S. relations urgently needed to be strengthened. It was pointed out that diplomatic policy should be determined based on national interests, and many condemned the diplomatic authorities for their mediocrity, which led to ambiguous and fence-sitting diplomacy in the past, seriously misleading the country. China has fought the Communists for twenty years, serving as an anti-communist vanguard, yet it has not been able to obtain the full cooperation and assistance of the United States, which holds the same anti-communist policy. This is all due to errors in diplomatic operations. In the future, China's direction should be clearly declared. The enhancement of Sino-U.S. relations cannot rely solely on traditional friendship. We must actively form an anti-communist group in Asia. The U.S. government and public will give Europe and the Far East equal importance.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Note on the Tokyo Tribunal's Sentencing <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Tokyo Tribunal, lasting twenty-three and a half months since its conclusion, has the world's public opinion anticipating the pronouncement of the Japanese war crimes, preparing for a final fair evaluation. According to recent Allied sources: the judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East has been drafted and will be pronounced as soon as the translation work is completed, around the middle of this month. Furthermore, according to the Washington dispatch prediction of the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun": those likely to be sentenced to death are Hideki Tojo, Akira Muto, Teiichi Suzuki, Shigeru Shimada, Seishiro Itagaki, Kenji Doihara, and six others, totaling twelve; those likely to be acquitted are Mamoru Shigemitsu, Yoshijiro Umezu, and Koki Kaya, three in total; Shunroku Hata is between a death sentence and acquittal, likely sentenced to detention; Jiro Minami and Iwane Matsui are likely to be sentenced to imprisonment. If this prediction is correct, the punishment of Japanese war criminals will still not have fully met the standards of fairness and rationality.</p>
<p>Punishing war criminals is a major event after the end of World War II. The establishment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is the responsible organization for trying Class A war criminals, following the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, commonly known as the Tokyo Tribunal. The Far East Tribunal filed indictments against twenty-eight (now only twenty-five) Class A war criminals, including Tojo and Hirota, on April 29, 1946, which lasted for over two years. The trial only concluded on April 16 this year, and there has been no sentence until now, which fully illustrates the consistent delays and laxity over the past two years, which is deeply regrettable. As the Chinese judge Mei Ru'ao said: "I have indeed noticed that, given the rapid changes in the world situation over the past two years, the Tokyo Tribunal has lost most of its political significance, but I deeply hope that it will not lose its legal and historical significance." This is a very insightful prediction. Compared with the Nuremberg trials of the Nazis, the legal and political significance of the Tokyo Tribunal, which cannot be ignored, has been weakened, leaving only some historical traces for future generations to mourn.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, the trial system adopted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is very thorough and ideal. However, the final decision on criminal punishment and its execution must be carried out by the Supreme Commander (referring to MacArthur) by order, which is unreasonable. According to regulations: the Supreme Commander may reduce or otherwise alter the penalties pronounced by the court at any time, but may not increase them; this is tantamount to saying that the court's judgment is not the final judgment for execution, and must be approved by the Supreme Commander before it can be executed. There are currently twenty-five Class A war criminals, and it is predicted that only twelve, including Tojo, will be sentenced to death, and Minami and Matsui will be imprisoned, while the others have great flexibility between guilty and not guilty. Given MacArthur's current indifferent attitude towards the tribunal, it is doubtful whether the sentences of death or imprisonment pronounced by the court will be reduced or delayed in the future. Therefore, it is said that the form of the Tokyo Tribunal is thorough and ideal, and in line with academic value, but in fact, the essence of the Tokyo Tribunal is to adopt a military dictatorship's adjudication system, where consciousness can change the law, and orders can change the law. Not only the deaths of war criminals, but also the dignity and sanctity of the law, are entrusted to MacArthur's final change of mind. Therefore, we are not comfortable being too optimistic about the upcoming results of the Tokyo Tribunal.</p>
<p>Politically speaking, the punishment of war criminals is to establish a principle for future generations, that "aggressive war is a crime," and it is not just a punishment for war criminals with the death penalty, but also has a warning significance for preventing war. Considering the identities and positions of the twenty-five Class A war criminals, as well as the broad political responsibilities they bore in the war, there is no doubt that they are all aggressors in the war. Even Shumei Okawa, who is exempt from prosecution, cannot escape the fact of the crime of aggression. Mamoru Shigemitsu, who is predicted to be acquitted, is an aggressive diplomat and strategist who served as Minister of the "Greater East Asia Ministry" and planned aggressive affairs. His crimes are the same as those of Koki Hirota and should be sentenced to death. Yoshijiro Umezu is a war criminal who invaded China. During his tenure as Commander of the Kwantung Army, he forced China to sign regional agreements, nibbled away at eastern Hebei, and invaded North China. His crimes are the same as those of Kenji Doihara and should be sentenced to death. Koki Kaya is the Finance Minister of the aggressive cabinet and a planner of aggressive war. He is also a bridge between the financial groups and the warlords. He served as the president of the "North China Development Company," turning China into a slave state. His crimes are the same as those of Teiichi Suzuki and should be sentenced to death. Shunroku Hata served as the Army Minister of the aggressive cabinet and the Supreme Commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army. He led a large army to invade North China and the Southwest. His crimes are the same as those of Seishiro Itagaki and should be sentenced to death. Jiro Minami was in charge of Korea and served as the Commander of the Kwantung Army, invading the Northeast; Iwane Matsui, during his tenure as the Supreme Commander of the Central China Army, massacred Nanjing, creating the greatest tragedy in the history of aggressive war. In any case, he should be sentenced to death. Their crimes should not only be sentenced to death legally, but also cannot be reduced or suspended politically, otherwise the political significance of the Tokyo Tribunal will be completely lost.</p>
<p>In short, the Tokyo Tribunal has reached its final moment, and world public opinion is paying close attention to it. In particular, the Chinese people have suffered the deepest oppression from the invasion of Japanese warlords, so they feel infinite concern and attention to the outcome of the trial. Today, the Allied headquarters' indifferent attitude towards the Tokyo Tribunal is extremely worrying; we hope that the Allied governments and Allied personnel will unanimously advocate for public justice, promptly announce the crimes of this group of war criminals to the world as soon as possible, and severely punish them, establish peace for the world, and uphold justice for mankind. This is our wish for the Tokyo Tribunal.</p>

<p>Wuxi [Report from our newspaper on the 3rd] The shops in this area are all closed and suspended sales as they wait to negotiate prices. The rice market was quite lively on the morning of the 3rd. The negotiated price for white japonica rice was originally 88 yuan, and for indica rice, 84 yuan. Later, due to the rush buying by the Shanghai group, the market became frenzied, surging to 105 yuan. The market immediately ordered the cancellation of the transaction. The final closing price was 95 yuan. Wheat has not been sold yet, and flour is still being negotiated. Off-market transactions reached 33 yuan. Soybean oil inventory is thin, and there is a lack of opening within the market. Off-market transactions are slightly more active. Yellow beans, which were 65 yuan yesterday, rose to 80 yuan today. Because license holders are pushing up the price, the oil price reached 237 yuan. County Magistrate Zhou confronted the market, and retail sales are temporarily priced at 2 yuan and 1 jiao per catty. It is said that Suzhou, Wuxing, and other places have already been out of stock for a long time. Furthermore, although the Price Evaluation Council was established today, it was postponed to 9:00 AM on the 4th for the evaluation meeting because the registration of various industries was not timely.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Report from our newspaper on the 3rd] Today, the market in Suzhou opened with white japonica rice at 76 yuan and 5 jiao per dan, and white indica at 73 yuan and 5 jiao. Retail sales are 78 yuan for white japonica and 75 yuan for white indica. There are very few transactions.</p>
<p>Hangzhou [Report from our newspaper on the 3rd] After the price limit was lifted, the prices of most commodities in various counties and cities in Zhejiang Province rose unreasonably. The Provincial Review Committee takes the principle of goods being sold in the market and profits being in accordance with the law as a guideline, and hopes that the news media will strictly supervise. The provincial government also instructed various counties and cities to set prices based on cost and severely punish violators, tighten market controls, and strictly crack down on speculation and hoarding. The Hangzhou Price Review initially approved a general threefold increase for seven industries, and retroactively recognized the price increases for fourteen industries that had already increased prices, with the principle of not exceeding Shanghai prices. However, the market price increases have become chaotic. Furthermore, the Zhejiang Province food control measures have recently been ordered to be abolished, allowing various places to restore free transport and sales.</p>

Except for fresh fruits, there are no other goods to buy.</p>
<p>Yangzhou [Report from our newspaper on the 3rd] The county government held an emergency management meeting on the morning of the 2nd.

However, during the transition period, it was decided to temporarily implement the allocation and purchase of rice, oil, and salt at the old allocation prices, and the price difference would be subsidized by various associations. Various industries continued to suspend operations for one day on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Chongqing [Report from our newspaper on the 3rd] The joint distribution office for cotton yarn failed to establish a price after the Machine Textile Industry Association requested an adjustment to 2,500 yuan for a bale of 20-count yarn priced at 992 yuan. The native cloth industry union hopes to verify and approve 1,500 yuan. Before a decision is made, a deposit of 2,000 yuan per bale will be temporarily paid first, and any overpayment will be refunded and any underpayment will be made up later.</p>

If the goals are not achieved, they will go on strike in solidarity. Although government leaders Jian Tingzhang Qian Zhenrong, Provincial Police Bureau Chief Fu Zhaoren, and County Magistrate Xie Mi came forward to mediate, bowing and scraping to the merchants, asking them to prioritize the local area, there was still no result until night.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Registering Chinese Nationals' Assets in the United States: Kong Xiangxi Expresses Sincere Support, Zhang Pingqun Discusses Three Difficulties in Implementation <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our New York, October 27th Dispatch] Mr. Kong Xiangxi, a resident of New York, stated to Zhang Pingqun, the Consul-General in New York, that he sincerely supports the central government's new monetary reform plan. If the relevant institutions and organizations in New York are ready and the procedures are well-planned, Mr. Kong is willing to be the first to register his assets in the United States, setting an example for the overseas Chinese community. However, Mr. Kong declined Consul-General Zhang's invitation to serve as a guiding committee member for asset registration.</p>
<p>According to Consul-General Zhang's conversation with reporters, the guiding committee was originally planned to be composed of five people. In addition to the Consul-General, Zhang Pingqun had invited Kong Xiangxi and Li Guoqin, but both firmly declined, so the "committee" has not been established to date. Mr. Zhang believes that the greatest difficulty in registering overseas deposits is the restrictions of New York State law (according to US law, different states have different regulations). New York State law stipulates that no foreign bank may accept deposits or conduct deposit business. The Bank of China in New York has only handled remittances for many years, not accepting deposits, and this is the reason. Zhang Pingqun believes that the government's purpose in registering overseas assets is to increase the government's foreign exchange reserves and prepare for borrowing and allocation when necessary. If the Bank of China in New York cannot accept deposits, all the assets of Chinese nationals in New York will still be held by American banks. Then, "what is the use of even a formal document registering numbers?" Therefore, Consul-General Zhang believes that the most urgent step today is to negotiate with Washington through the central government, or with the US State Department through the embassy, to allow the United States to lift the restrictions on the Bank of China in New York to accept deposits.</p>
<p>Consul-General Zhang also mentioned that Li Guoqin has repeatedly expressed his support for the government's asset registration decree, but Mr. Li also has practical difficulties. As a major businessman in New York, his assets are constantly being transferred and turned over. Li himself has deposits, but also has debts. This is what is called "assets" and "liabilities" in accounting. Li Guoqin has repeatedly stated clearly that if the government wants him to register his assets, he must also register his liabilities at the same time. Consul-General Zhang believes that in addition to Li Guoqin, there are many others in the same situation, which is another difficulty in implementing the order.</p>
<p>The third difficulty, Consul-General Zhang believes, is the interpretation of the term "overseas Chinese." How to handle the case of American Chinese citizens with dual nationality? This difficulty was discussed by Minister Wang Yunwu at a press conference when he passed through New York a month ago. Minister Wang believes that it still needs careful study. As for the first two difficulties, Consul-General Zhang had informed Minister Wang in detail and asked the government to study the matter further.</p>
<p>Zhang Pingqun told our reporter that he is determined to implement the government order seriously and will not shirk or neglect his duties. However, the United States is an extremely liberal country, and the government does not have special extraterritorial rights to interfere with or manage the actions of its citizens, especially not to interfere with any private economic life. Most people in the country are well aware of this situation. Zhang hopes that given time and careful handling, something can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Democratic Party Wins Unexpectedly Big Victory, Controls Both Houses of US Congress, Also Holds Absolute Advantage in Gubernatorial Elections <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] In this election, the Democratic Party not only obtained a very large number of votes nationwide, but has also gained control of the Senate, and seems certain to regain a majority in the House of Representatives. This is truly an unexpected major change. The various predictions made in advance by those conducting public opinion polls and political commentators have all been overturned. They are now rushing to explain the reasons for the Democratic Party's sudden victory: (1) The labor vote is more powerful than before; (2) The number of votes supporting the Progressive Party or the Socialist Party is less than expected; (3) Strong local Democratic senatorial or gubernatorial candidates have helped the national election vote; (4) Farmers voting for the Republican Party are not as numerous as expected. The biggest impression we have is that the late President Roosevelt's New Deal still has a major effect on American voters. It is generally believed that Truman's repeated statements that the Democratic Party adheres to Roosevelt's New Deal measures have had an effect and gained the support of many neutral voters. As for the Republican Party's low vote count in this election, it may reflect a lot. American voters still do not trust the party's domestic performance. Truman's constant attacks on the Republican-controlled 80th Congress may have had an effect. Regardless of whether Truman is elected, the unusually large number of votes he received has given the Democratic Party new life.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Democratic National Committee announced on the 3rd that the Democratic Party has controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the next Congress.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The Democratic Party today broke the 48-48 deadlock in the Senate and has firmly grasped control. In the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party has also won a majority of 218 seats. After all the ballots are counted, an ample majority can be used.

US military circles said that the Taegu district war began at 1:00 p.m. on the 2nd, because a sergeant refused to be arrested because the charges were not determined, and shot at the military police with a gun.

<h3 id="e61">Four Major Companies Resume Business Yesterday, Prices of All Goods Increase Twofold, Hotel Prices Increase Twofold, Cotton Cloth Follows Approved Wholesale Price Plus 30%, New Prices for Public Utilities to Be Announced This Weekend <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] With the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau, the prices of all goods in the four major companies, including Wing On and Sincere on Nanjing Road, have been adjusted to increase by 200%, and business resumed yesterday afternoon. Also, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday approved the hotel industry to increase prices by 200% from today, and the cotton cloth industry to increase prices by 30% based on the government-approved wholesale price, including operating expenses, taxes, and profits. As for the items that should be negotiated in price, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the respective trade associations to conduct preliminary reviews and report for approval. The Social Affairs Bureau needs to wait for the central government to announce the price of rationed rice per capita in November before making a decision on the price of budget meals.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the reporter asked Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, about the adjustment multiple of public utility prices. According to him, the cost prices of public utilities are being calculated separately by the respective companies, and the borrowing number of the increase cannot be predicted at present. Because the price of rationed coal and the new salaries and wages of employees are all undetermined, it is impossible to estimate. However, today's public utility prices are frozen according to the 819 limited price, and its costs are based on the July prices as the base, which is very far from the current prices. Therefore, it is generally estimated that the increase multiple of public utility prices may be quite alarming. The current price negotiations in various industries are regarded as assumptions, and adjustments will be made after the new prices for public utilities are announced. According to Director Zhao, the new prices for public utilities are expected to be announced this weekend.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The supplementary measures stipulate that yarn and cloth are priced by the central competent authority and regulated in a coordinated manner, but black market situations have been found in this city where various industries have raised prices for sale. The Social Affairs Bureau will strictly crack down on this. The bureau has recently ordered the three trade associations of the cotton textile industry, the machine dyeing and weaving industry, and the cotton cloth business to comply with two points: (1) They should be sold in accordance with the approved price and must not exceed it. If there is any intentional violation, it will be severely dealt with in accordance with the regulations on violating limited prices and negotiated prices. (2) Retail cloth stores have depleted their inventory due to the rush buying spree. In the future, retail merchants should be given priority in the distribution of goods to meet market sales, and wholesale merchants should be temporarily suspended from distribution. The remaining quota should be distributed to retail merchants together. Once the market returns to normal, wholesale will be reopened.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Rice Business Association held a general meeting of all members yesterday afternoon and resolved two points: (1) Rice shops are running out of funds. An electric administrative agency is requested to provide relief and organize interest-free loans. (2) The handling fee for rice shops to handle the per capita distribution of rice is 5%, which cannot be maintained. The Civil Food Allocation Committee is requested to increase it. After the meeting, representatives such as Wan Molin and Qu Zhenhua were dispatched to petition the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Retailers of rice, oil, sundries, and cotton cloth have been petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau for days, stating that the inventories of their respective industries have been depleted after the rush buying spree, while wholesalers have suffered no losses. They requested that wholesalers share the losses and provide relief to retailers. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, there is no legal basis for this matter, and the government's handling method has not yet been determined. He will first persuade retailers and wholesalers in various industries to negotiate their own solutions.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Sundries Stores Cannot Open, Supply of Goods Is a Problem, Prices Are Even More Impossible to Discuss <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The nature of the sundries industry in this city is that of retailers, and all goods are supplied by the seafood, northern goods, and longan wholesale industries. In order to calculate costs, the Sundries Industry Association invited the Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan Wholesale Industry Associations to hold a joint meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss prices. In the past, the members of the Sundries Industry Association followed the price limit policy and queued up for residents to rush to buy them every day, resulting in the depletion of nine out of ten of their inventories. Since the implementation of the price limit, the seafood, northern goods, and longan industries have failed to fully supply goods. They are currently in urgent need of price negotiations in order to open for business. However, by about 11:00 a.m., only the representatives of the seafood industry provided price indications. The other representatives of the northern goods industry attended the meeting but did not express anything, and no representatives from the longan industry attended. As a result, price negotiations could not proceed, and all sundries stores in the city were still unable to open for business due to the unresolved issue of goods supply.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The shipping industry has felt that the current passenger and freight rates are no longer sustainable and has repeatedly submitted adjustments to the Ministry of Communications, but there has been no reasonable solution to date. According to the Shipping Association yesterday, representatives were recently sent to Beijing again to request adjustments from the Ministry of Communications. As a result, only a twofold increase was allowed. However, the price of oil and coal fuel is about to rise, and the cost of living index will also be restored. The shipping industry is heavily burdened and still feels unable to sustain it. Therefore, it is difficult to implement the 100% approved by the Ministry of Communications. It can only wait for the oil and coal prices to be adjusted before reporting to the Ministry for reasonable adjustments. Also, the Shipping Association announced on the 2nd that from the 2nd of this month, the freight for registered goods will be charged at the current freight rate for the time being, but after the adjustment, the new price must be paid retroactively. As for passenger ticket prices, from the 2nd, a meal fee of 50% will be temporarily added. It is reported that train passenger fares will also increase fivefold, and the postage for regular letters will increase from 5 cents to 10 cents.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The whereabouts of the 20,000 bolts of cloth allocated by the Management Office to rice merchants has become the subject of social attention. According to a report in a local newspaper in this city yesterday, Director Wu Kaixian said that the 20,000 bolts of cloth had been handed over to the Rice Industry Association, and the rice had been exchanged and sold in Shanghai. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter from a person in charge of the Management Office, who said: The rice merchants supplied rice first in the matter of exchanging cloth for rice, starting after receiving the order on the 10th of last month. It is also a fact that the purchase price of rice merchants when purchasing from the producing area was higher than the limited price. The allocation of cotton cloth to rice merchants was on the eve of the lifting of the price limit. As for the transaction situation, Wan Molin has been ordered to provide detailed receipts and account books for review. The Management Office will strictly investigate and verify with a consistent responsible attitude. If any malfeasance is found, it will be given the most severe punishment.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to yesterday's report, the Supervision and Guidance Office of the Management Office summoned Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, etc., to inquire about the whereabouts of the 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth allocated for rice exchange, and there was a saying that they were ordered to return them all. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday: "There is no such thing. I have inquired with Supervisor Jiang, and Supervisor Jiang also said that there is no such fact." Director Wu also said: "The matter of exchanging cloth for rice was approved by Supervisor Jiang, and it has been ordered since October 10 that rice can be exchanged for cloth. The Rice Industry Association has been instructed to comply with the implementation. It has been many days now, and there should be no more changes. Rice merchants can go to the Rice Industry Association to collect cloth in accordance with the original method. This Bureau has also notified the Association to report in detail the amount of rice transported and the number of rice shops distributed and the amount of cloth exchanged since that day, so that it can be forwarded."</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 3rd), the tightness of the money supply in the three cities intensified, becoming increasingly severe.

However, interest rates continued to climb, reaching over 60% in some cases, with the general rate exceeding 54%. The availability of cash was also quite limited, and banks continued to restrict withdrawals.</p>
<p>Merchants Unwilling to Sell Lightly, Tea Market Transactions Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday, tea merchants remained firm in their intention to sell, quoting prices at a high point, resulting in a lack of transactions. According to a prominent figure in the tea industry, there is currently significant international interest in Chinese tea. However, since the authorities permitted the relaxation of price controls and implemented negotiated pricing based on costs, prices of all goods have risen sharply. The future cost of producing tea for export, including labor and all related supplies, will increase by 150%, while overseas tea prices remain stable. Considering this situation, exports may face difficulties in the short term.</p>

<p>Refugee Students Temporarily Residing in Jiangwan: No Confirmed Location for Yantai Temporary Middle School</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Zhao Lanting, Ma Wenyuan, and other principals of middle schools evacuated from Yantai to Shanghai, received reporters at the Shandong Fellow-Villagers Association at 2:00 PM yesterday. Li Ximou, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, Gao Guoliang, of the Youth Counseling Committee, and Zhang Qinxu, of the Shandong Provincial Department of Education, also attended. The principals of the middle schools expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the care and enthusiastic assistance provided by all sectors of Shanghai for the evacuation of Yantai students to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Relocation to Jiangwan</p>
<p>The refugee students have now been relocated to the transit troops reception center in Jiangwan. The Ministry of Education has remitted 30,000 yuan to maintain their meals, and counselors from various middle schools in the city are taking turns to be responsible for guidance. The Comforting Association is planning to perform movies and Chinese opera there and open the library and reading room to provide spiritual comfort. Fang Zhi and Li Ximou are scheduled to give speeches there at 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Educational Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the students' educational issues, it has been decided to establish the Shandong Provincial Yantai Temporary Middle School. The location was originally set in Dinghai Ning, but because a large number of Xuzhou students have already moved there, another location will be selected. Zhao Lanting is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to discuss with the Ministry of Education, and it is expected that the location can be determined and moved away from Shanghai within two weeks. Currently, the students are staying in Jiangwan, and due to insufficient cooking equipment, they have been eating bread for the past two days, consuming 2,400 pounds per meal. The Ministry of Education has approved a subsidy of 4.2 yuan per person per month for non-staple foods and 2.3 sheng of rice, which is not enough to maintain them.</p>
<p>Northeast Wind's Fourth Battle: Today Meeting Zichao</p>
<p>Still at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Northeast Wind football team's fourth match in Shanghai will be against the mixed Chinese-Western Zichao team at Yiyuan on Shaanxi South Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. In the guest team's past three matches, they have met Railway, Qingbai, and China Aviation, resulting in a draw in each case, which can be described as a coincidence. The team's instructor, Jiang Lu, once said, "If you think Northeast Wind is not bad, they have never won; if you think they are not good, they have never lost," which is a fair assessment. The team is energetic and determined, and the players are tall and strong. Today, they are facing a strong enemy and will definitely fight with all their strength. Zichao has emerged as a dark horse this year, with a combination of Chinese and Western stars. Captain Wu Qixiang has also added foreign players such as "Yellow Hair" Robert Stoffs, "Pockmarked Face" Nogolov, and Grinas Schilz, promising a fierce battle with the guest team. The referee is Wang Chongye, the linesmen are Jiang Yinseng and Zhang Le, and tickets are available for 1 yuan and 60 cents.</p>

<p>Violin Virtuoso Ma Sicong in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Hangzhou 3rd Dispatch] Brother Sicong and his wife came to Hangzhou for sightseeing in 1936, without giving a performance. It has been twelve years. The long-separated lakes and mountains, the long-separated friendship, must be exceptionally cordial and exciting. Especially after more than ten performances in Shanghai, they can take a break on the refreshing shores of West Lake. However, in order to stimulate the musical atmosphere of Hangzhou and provide music lovers in Hangzhou with the opportunity to listen, I again requested a few performances in Hangzhou during our intimate conversation, and they finally agreed.</p>
<p>Chatting about Hangzhou and Beiping</p>
<p>He loves the lakes and mountains of Hangzhou very much. He said that it is good to be close to nature and necessary to be close to the people. He also agreed that such a beautiful mountain lake as Hangzhou should become a cultural city. Brother Sicong thought she was too gentle, but after seeing the Liuhe Pagoda, he changed his tone. However, he still felt that the architectural style of Hangzhou was inferior to that of Beiping, because Beiping appeared very grand and majestic. I said that Beiping's status as a cultural city was largely inherited from feudalism. I said that we must build a truly people-owned cultural city. So we talked about Chinese culture. Before the Tang Dynasty, almost all of China's art and culture were popularized among the people. After the Tang Dynasty, especially after the Song Dynasty, culture was owned by the emperors, and the people could not enjoy the happiness bestowed by culture. Therefore, we have regressed step by step since the Tang Dynasty, while European and American countries have made significant progress.</p>
<p>Attending Literary and Art Evening Party</p>
<p>On October 25th, Brother Sicong and his wife attended the welcoming literary and art evening party we hosted. This was the fifth literary and art evening party we have held. Brother Sicong did not speak, but used the sound of his violin to replace his words. When he played the strings, each sound closely touched the heartstrings of the audience, moving their emotions and then leading them into a leisurely and yearning realm. When he finished playing, the audience returned to normal and, recalling the already longed-for artistic conception, could not help but cheer and ask for "one more!"</p>
<p>Warm Tea Party Reception</p>
<p>The 26th was a warm tea party hosted by the old painter Mr. Lin Fengmian. Mr. Lin invited many artists and painters. Thanks to Mr. Lin's relative, Mr. Kama, who repeatedly played records of famous musicians from his collection, giving us endless expectations in the face of our Chinese violinist today. The 27th was a concert at the Air Force School, "Tibetan Tone Poem," the voice of the motherland told the air warriors of the motherland that they should love this vast homeland. The 28th was a welcome concert at the Art College. At this gathering, Principal Zhu Kezhen talked about using music to influence the atmosphere of war.</p>
<p>His Own Concerts</p>
<p>The 29th, 30th, and 31st were the three days of his own concerts, held at the Art College on the Outer West Lake. It was necessary to pass through Bai Causeway to get there. If you traveled from the Lower City to the Art College, it was a three-kilometer journey, but thousands of music lovers went there madly to listen to the music. The quiet Bai Causeway on that late autumn night suddenly became lively.</p>
<p>It really stirred up the barren music scene in Hangzhou, and various schools and organizations requested performances one after another. November 1st to Zhejiang University, 2nd to Zhejiang University, and 3rd to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau. In total, Brother Sicong won the support of over 10,000 listeners in Hangzhou this time.</p>
<p>Brother Sicong is not only a performer but also a composer. He told me that his "Spring Cantata" will be published soon. I wish him continued efforts forever, because music is the song of nature, is poetry, is the truest sound, and is the ode of the people.</p>

<p>Principal Offender Wang Qinglan Indicted in the Case of the Shooting of Henan Refugee Students in Beijing</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] In the case of Wang Qinglan, the owner of a grocery store on Jiankang Road in Beijing, shooting and killing Henan refugee students, the principal offender Wang Qinglan has been indicted by the District Prosecutor's Office on charges of murder and endangering public safety. The prosecuting prosecutor requested the criminal court to apply Article 23 of the Criminal Law because Wang's behavior was quite close to the meaning of self-defense, hence the prosecutor's discussion of it.</p>
<p>Negotiated Rice Prices in Various Places</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Kunshan 3rd Dispatch] Since the announcement of the supplementary measures for economic reform, the authorities have decided to allow free buying and selling of rice. The standard for negotiated prices must not be higher than that of Xichang and other counties. All urban and rural checkpoints have been abolished. There were transactions in the rice market today (the 3rd), with white japonica rice at 75 yuan per shi. Furthermore, this year's field tax began to be levied across the board on the 1st, with a total of 3.6 dou of rice collected for each tax yuan, including donations.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Jiaxing 2nd Dispatch] With the lifting of price controls, businesses in various industries negotiated new prices based on costs plus profits on the 1st through their respective trade associations. From the 2nd, important items such as rice and oil were sold at the new prices after the county magistrate agreed. The retail price of white japonica rice, Dongshuang, and Renjian was 78 yuan per shi, Henanjian and glutinous rice were 75 yuan, and vegetable oil was 1.9 yuan per catty. The prices of other items have not yet been negotiated because the prices of the same industries in Shanghai and Hangzhou have not been obtained. It is scheduled to be negotiated on the 2nd and reported to the county government for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Songjiang 2nd Dispatch] According to the Chamber of Commerce, the prices of various daily necessities have been instructed by County Magistrate Xu to be three times the cost of the 819 price controls, and will be adjusted after the evaluation committee decides. Other items can be reasonably adjusted freely by each industry and reported to the county for record. Currently, the prices of various goods are rising sharply, and the chaos has reached its peak.</p>

The second meeting of the Provincial Materials Regulation Committee decided not to return them. The rice and paddy were handed over to the Zhenjiang Materials Regulation Office for allocation and sale, and the wheat was handed over to the Zhenjiang Flour Mill for processing into noodles for distribution to alleviate the people's food shortage. The above materials were taken over by the Materials Regulation Office and the Flour Mill respectively on the 2nd.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Jiangdu 3rd Dispatch] The military headquarters of a certain army stationed in Yangzhou executed Zhang Delong, the leader of a plainclothes detachment, on the morning of the 2nd.

<p>Far East Showcase: New Display</p>
<p>Xie Mingxin</p>
<p>[Hong Kong 1st Air Dispatch] If we compare Europe during World War II to China today, which is in the midst of a civil war, then the position and situation of Hong Kong are just like Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, where international spies were plotting against each other at that time.</p>
<p>This showcase of the British Empire in the Far East has now become a base for smuggling and a haven for political prisoners.</p>
<p>Xu Jizhuang, the former director of the Postal Remittance Bureau, who was arrested on suspicion of corruption, has not yet been extradited to the Chinese government. The reason is that Xu's confession has shifted its focus to "opposing the government." This excuse for dodging inquiries from the Hong Kong court is nothing more than using the name of "political prisoner" to allow Britain, which claims to be a democratic polity, to protect him and not hand him over to the Chinese government to avoid death.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been widely rumored here that Cai Tingkai, Zhang Bojun, and others have gone to the Red Capital of Harbin to participate in the "New Political Consultative Conference" hosted by the CCP. The next day, the left-wing newspaper Huashang Bao made no mention of this, and the Xinhua News Agency also had no reports. General Li Jishen, Cai's old superior, refused to meet with newspaper reporters, acting as if nothing had happened. In fact, Zhang Bojun, Cai Tingkai, and others had long ago secretly gone to Macau to obtain birth certificates, used their Portuguese status to have the Soviet consulate sign them, and boarded Soviet-controlled merchant ships to go to North Korea first and then to the Northeast border, and have now arrived in Harbin. It is said that this meeting is not a formal "New Political Consultative Conference," but rather a "New Political Consultative Preparatory Meeting."</p>
<p>Left-wing intellectuals staying in Hong Kong, except for Mao Dun, Xia Yan, and others who can arrange their lives by writing, generally cannot solve the two major problems of career and livelihood, because although Hong Kong claims to be a small political center and a cultural fortress, the real power in Hong Kong is in the hands of the British, and Hong Kong's economic power is only in the industrial and commercial sectors. The capacity for accommodating and digesting cultural figures is extremely limited. The best-selling newspaper in Hong Kong is Cheng Bao, a typical yellow tabloid that is best suited to the tastes of Hong Kong's petty bourgeoisie and is the most suitable reading material for leisure after tea and wine. Secondly, there is the long-established Overseas Chinese Daily, which is similar to the Shen and Xin newspapers in Shanghai in its position in Hong Kong, targeting businessmen, with many advertisements, many pages, and the most issues. The Dagong Bao, sponsored by the Department of Political Science, the recently relocated and republished Wenhui Bao, and the Sing Tao Daily of the Hu Wenhu Foundation have relatively close numbers in terms of sales.</p>
<p>The real focus of Hong Kong is definitely not politics and culture, but its commercial position. Its impact on China's international trade and its connection with China's financial market are very close and have a very large relationship. Hong Kong's financial black market can disrupt the entire Chinese financial market. Despite your official prohibition of foreign exchange arbitrage between black market Hong Kong dollars and gold yuan coupons, there are still many people operating in reality. Since October, Shenhui transactions have become rampant again. This is certainly related to the Battle of Jinan and the Shanghai buying spree. The Shanghai authorities' failure to open up imports, which led to a situation of ample inventory but no goods on the market, was also a miscalculation.</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong claims to be a "free trade port," this oriental commercial port is heavily bound by some British laws and regulations. For example, you must declare the import of gold and foreign currency in advance, otherwise it will be confiscated. Many overseas Chinese have suffered a great loss because they do not understand this rigid rule. Also, goods must be applied for foreign exchange settlement for export, which also causes a lot of trouble for legitimate merchants. A permit must also be applied for the import of goods. In addition, the harsh and detailed clauses and precedents are so numerous that even old Hong Kong people and even judges are confused. This is Hong Kong's "rule of law."</p>
<p>Hong Kong currently has close to one million people, and the housing shortage and food supply depend on Guangzhou and other places. The cost of living can be said to be the highest in the world, but the residents of Hong Kong are very good at finding fun and entertaining themselves. Even if they are not full at three meals a day, women must have beautiful cheongsams and American cosmetics, and men must wear well-tailored suits and enjoy movies or Cantonese opera. Everything must be maintained on the surface and is very hypocritical. Hong Kong people can be said to be the people who like face the most.</p>
<p>Moral cases, rape cases, suicide cases, smuggling cases, and fraud cases have become the daily routine of the local courts, which symbolizes the abnormal prosperity of Hong Kong society and its inevitable decline.</p>
<p>Social Services: Please Note for Readers</p>
<p>In recent reader consultation letters, we have discovered two phenomena:</p>
<p>(1) Some readers are unwilling to write their real names and addresses in their letters, and often use "A Reader," "A Citizen," or other pseudonyms. This has caused a lot of obstacles to our service work.</p>
<p>(2) Some "opinions" and "appeals" letters do not have the signature and seal of a definite person in charge, or even have no specific facts. We really cannot handle these letters.</p>
<p>In the future, we hope that readers who write letters to inquire will be able to tell us their real names and detailed addresses so that we can reduce the trouble of dealing with "headless cases." At the same time, it can also prevent the hard-working green-clad messengers from running extra wrong roads due to "misplaced letters" stating "there is no such person at this address." We are wholeheartedly serving our readers and hope that readers will assist us more in this regard.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Meeting of the General Labor Union's Executive and Supervisory Committee Discussing Important Wage and Livelihood Issues; Before the Publication of This Month's Index, Wages Will Temporarily Be Increased by Three Times the Original Salary; Requesting the Government to Abolish Basic Salary Discounts <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Municipal General Labor Union convened an emergency meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members to discuss important issues such as wages after the lifting of economic controls.  Zhou Xuexiang, Shui Xiangyun, Ye Xianggao, Fang Rusheng, Liang Yongzhang, and many other executive and supervisory committee members and heads of various industry unions attended.  Chairman Shui Xiangyun passed the following resolutions: (1) Regarding wage issues: A, a request will be submitted to the government to abolish all existing discounts on basic wages; B, wages should be issued uniformly based on the Fuqi index; C, wages should be issued within five days after the index is published. (2) Regarding the issue of daily necessities rations for workers: A, if the worker's rationed goods are used to calculate the index based on rationed prices, the government should be requested to provide them on schedule; otherwise, the difference in price should be compensated at market prices; B, the quality of rationed goods should not be lower than the quality of items stipulated in the cost-of-living index. (3) Regarding the October rice purchase certificates for workers, any unions that have submitted certificates but have not yet received rice should vigorously argue with the Civil Affairs Commission, and Chairman Shui and the executive directors should be authorized to request the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Affairs Commission to approve and issue the rice at 10:00 AM tomorrow. (4) In October, black market prices soared. Apart from public utilities, cotton spinning, cigarette, and silk weaving unions, where factories have already advanced one month's salary, other industrial and professional workers who have not received advances should be informed to request advances from their employers as an example, to supplement the insufficient living expenses of workers in October. (5) For fluid workers without a fixed employer (such as plasterers, carpenters, plumbers, etc.), whose wages are settled on a temporary basis, the government is requested to approve the temporary calculation of wages at three times the original salary before the November cost-of-living index is published. (6) All unions that have not reported their representatives should submit their reports to the union before October 15; failure to report by the deadline will be considered a waiver. (7) Preparations for the sixth session of the representative assembly for re-election have been completed and it has been decided to hold it at the Four Sisters Restaurant at 9:00 AM on November 21.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Exchange of one-cent copper coins resumed yesterday. The authorities stipulate that each bank or shop is limited to exchanging 50 to 100 yuan per unit, and a written application must first be made.  A maximum of two exchanges are allowed per month. The Central Mint sent eighty boxes of copper coins to the Central Bank yesterday. If there are no restrictions on the exchange, the supply will inevitably fall short of demand, hence the above regulations. The minting of fifty-cent silver coins has also begun, but the issuance date awaits a decision from the ministry, and it is rumored that it may be in early next month.</p>

However, according to the stock exchange authorities, the exchange was ordered to close, so its reopening also awaits new instructions. As of now, no relevant instructions have been received, and the exchange has not held any meetings or planned to send anyone to the capital to seek instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e88">At the Most Severe Coal Shortage, the Power Company's Reserves Are Only Enough for Six Days; The Public Utilities Bureau Requests Expedited Allocation <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The coal shortage in this city has reached its most severe stage. According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, the Shanghai Electric Power Company's coal reserves are only sufficient to supply until the 9th of this month. If no coal is received within the next five days, the company will be forced to reduce power generation from the 10th, and will try its best to replace it with fuel oil. For this reason, the Public Utilities Bureau has repeatedly consulted with the Fuel Management Committee, requesting that coal be allocated before the 9th to alleviate the urgent need. It is now known that the Lingyun ship was sailing to Taiwan to load coal but unfortunately ran aground. It has now been rescued and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within a few days. The ship is carrying 7,500 tons of coal, and if there is no loss, it can temporarily alleviate the emergency.</p>
<p>According to Director Zhao: The coal shortage should be a major problem for this city this winter. Coal-producing areas have abundant coal reserves. Currently, Kailuan has 700,000 tons of coal, and Huainan has 140,000 tons, but they are suffering from a lack of transportation. According to statistics, the monthly coal demand of various public utilities in this city is 46,900 tons. If the coal supply is cut off, it will be a major threat to people's livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities are now planning to suggest to the central government to allocate troops to protect coal transportation and speed up the transportation of coal stored in Huainan to Shanghai. It is also known that 70,000 tons of foreign coal ordered by the China Trust Bureau from abroad is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month or early next month.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Very Few Goods Arriving from Traders, Rice Market Is Strong; Flour Is Not Open for Business, Edible Oil Cannot Meet Demand <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Very little rice is arriving, with a total of 1,046 shi arriving in the North and South markets yesterday, mostly from rice shops doing their own business. Very few goods are arriving from traders, so the market has no goods to supply. The market is very strong, and no spot prices have been quoted. It is reported that ten-day delivery of road cargo japonica rice is being quoted at 95 yuan, and the market is rising.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Formal negotiated prices have not been set, and factories have not yet supplied the market, so there is no trading. It is reported that miscellaneous brand flour is being quoted at 40 yuan. Bran is in urgent demand in the countryside, and the price has risen again. Large bags of bran are up to 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Trading is becoming more prosperous every day. Few soybeans are arriving, and there is a shortage. Hankou Zhadou is 60 yuan, Poyang soybeans are 65 yuan, up 10 yuan. Corn from the North is being imported instead of exported, and the price has decreased by 3 yuan. Red sorghum is down 4 to 5 yuan. Buckwheat and cowpeas are both weak. Sesame trading has become more active, and peanut prices are similar.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Supply cannot meet demand. Cooked vegetable oil is up 5 to 10 yuan, but it is still not enough to distribute. The manufacturers jointly opened sales, with about 3,000 dan of soybean oil and rapeseed oil, all priced at 190 yuan. Jiangbei net raw oil has also been quoted, priced at 238 yuan. The Zhongzhi Factory did not lead the opening of sales, resulting in insufficient oil supply. Sesame oil has not been quoted. Soybean cake is scarce, with Yu Ji cake at 25 yuan, up 2.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Rice Shop Suspected of Raising Prices, Manager Detained <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] More than 1,000 shi of goods arrived in the North and South rice markets yesterday, but no formal trading took place. During trading hours in the South market, Ding Yichang Rice Shop at No. 102 Shanxi Road sold 70 shi of Jiangxi indica rice at a price of 110 yuan, which was purchased by Yuanchang at No. 6 Daxing Street (20 shi) and Xiangmao at No. 5 Zhi'an Lane, Luxiangyuan Road (50 shi). Social Affairs Bureau personnel stationed at the market suspected that it was raising prices and, after reporting to the bureau for instructions, detained Ding Xianglin, the manager of Ding Yichang Rice Shop, and transferred him to the police station. Later, he was released on bail by Yuanda Shop and ordered to be available for questioning at any time.</p>
<p>According to Wu, director of the Social Affairs Bureau: According to the rules of the rice market, rice shops purchase from the market and resell to citizens. However, Ding Yichang Rice Shop sold in the market and quoted a price of 110 yuan, which was a sudden increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous day, which obviously suspected of deliberately raising prices. Although food has been approved for free trade, manipulative behavior will still be prohibited. The disposal of the case will be reported to Mayor Wu for approval.</p>
