<h3>全國經委會討論決定　外匯政策不予改訂　收購出口物資辦法通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕關於外匯政策之改訂與否問題，廿二日全國經濟委會例會中曾有所討論。王雲五認爲現行外匯政策，有可修改之點，或予以開放。潘序倫則認爲可參考英國外匯政策，以收購出口外匯之一部份，現行外匯政策應予改革。張羣當即發言稱：改訂外匯政策關係甚大，其影響之後果，可能引起不可挽救之危機。旋經討論，當經一致主張，進出口聯鎖仍以現行辦法爲宜，不予擬訂。</p>
<p>收購出口物資辦法，前經全經會十七日小組會審査後，廿二日提出全經會討論，當經修正通過。全文如次：（甲）收購原則：出口物資由商人依據政府規定之輸出入結匯辦法，以自由運轍爲主，但遇商人輸出困難時，輸出入管理委會得決定收購辦法。（乙）收購種類：桐油·大豆·生絲·蛋品·豬　·茶葉·羊毛七種，並以其他特產工業品爲收購對象。（丙）收購機關：由中信局辦理，並得委托其他業務機關承辦。（丁）收購價格：由財政部，經濟部，審計部，農林部，四聯總處，輸管會，中央銀行，中央信託局派員組織收購審價委員會，由輸管會召集，其所訂價格，以顧及生產者利潤爲原則。（戊）收購品質：出口物資品質，必須標準化，由經濟部商品檢驗局嚴格檢査，已出口物資盈虧，由國庫負担。</p>
<p>又悉：關於工貸一事，四聯總處或將擬定一具體辦法，呈請主席核示。</p>
<h3>經濟方案商業及交通部份　實施辦法修正通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕全國經濟會廿二日下午三時舉行第卅一次例會，張羣主席，副秘書長顧毓線報告卅六年度之國內經濟狀况及四度物價漲風與政府對物價漲風措施之成效，作詳盡之比較及分析，並指出上漲原因，同時宣讀第八次物價會議決議案。旋由張羣宣佈臨時改變議事日程，討論　收購出口物資辦法修正通過；　經濟改革方案商業部份實施辦法修正通過；　經濟改革方案交通部份實施辦法修正通過。討論時，對於商業部份中原方案二，實施辦法第四項中規定「禁止奢侈品及其他不需要物品進口，並限期禁止在市面出售」。曾有委員提議删除，主張奢侈品仍准入口，惟必須加重其關稅或提高印花稅後，准在市面出售，但爲大部委員所反對，認爲禁止奢侈品進口及限期禁止出售，其目的乃在節省外匯，並非在求稅收之增加。各委員發言熱烈，激辯甚久，結果仍照原規定通過。商業部份之主要修正如次：　原方案三，其第五項推行進出口聯營辦法所列舉之五個項目删除；原方案四，關於合作社業務之充實及改進，以及與國際合作之聯繫，其實施辦法另行擬訂（實施辦法全文見十日本報第一版）。關於交通部份主要之修正爲：原方案四，其甲項「港口之經營」予以保留，對港口經營管理，另訂辦法，由中央或市主管機關分別經營取管理，丙項「增加民營航業船舶噸位」中所訂「鼓勵民營步驟」之五項辦法全部删除（實施辦法全文見十大·十七兩日本報第五版）。會中並曾討論經濟改革方案國水利部份實施辦法，因原擬辦法份量與體例多有未合，將交由水利部另行擬訂辦法。</p>

<h3>中墨兩國政府　停止白銀談判　盼由美貸欵穩定貨幣</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕消息靈通外交界稱：中國政府已決定停止與墨西縣政府談判鑄造新銀幣事，渠等稱：代之而起者，係將其希望置於貨幣安定計劃上。此項計劃，係由中國披術代表團團長貝　詒携來華府，企圖獲得美國之讃同與援助者，　氏尙未有機　呈遞之計劃，要求美國供給三億美元，作爲「穩定基金」，以爲發行中　新幣之準備金。該方面稱：　氏在與美國官員討論時，將要求美方對　定基金一事，予以優先考慮，其他種類之援助，則屬次要，美方現正企圖以商品及復興機器，作爲長期援助中之大部分。但中國人相信：如能同時實施議定基金措施，則此事將更有效果。該方面又稱：中國與墨西哥之白銀談判於去秋開始，其後　　　續，曾經中國財政部加以否稱，因國民黨不十分相信購買白銀即能有滿意結果也。渠等稱：該項談判，可能係關於中墨西哥政府爲中國鑄造約値二億五千萬至三億美元之銀幣，以代替中國價値幾等於零之紙幣，而由中國以商品償還墨西哥政府。惟該方面又稱：國民黨財政專家認爲：任令中國貨幣受白銀市塲之波動操縱，實非聰頴之舉，因此，對於現墨西哥談判，從未十分注意。渠等稱：此項談判，目前實際上已告停止。</p>
<p>貝祖詒之任務　同時據中美可靠方面之消息稱：　美國宜員與貝　詒所率領之代表團之問，對於彼等來此之眞正任務，意見極爲紛歧，據渠等稱：中國人相信：就美國在十五個月內以三億餘美元貸與中國問題而言，貝氏具有若干直接發言權，但美人認爲：貝氏代表團，僅如外間揣測者，係一從事純粹技術討論之代表團。渠，等稱：美人曾指示，渠等深盼貝氏及其僚屬對於實施美國計劃之詳細問題能供給諮詢，但美人並未考慮—中國人士能在政策會商上有何發言權。渠等指出，貝氏代表團迄今爲止，祇在十九日午餐席上，與國務部官員有一度接觸，下午繼之在助理國務卿索普之公署中，有一度開會而已，廿日及廿一日，中美官員並無會晤，貝氏代表團祇與職任較低之技術官員會晤。據參加十九日會談人士之消息稱：該次所討論者，僅爲中國經濟情形一般性之討論，但雙方皆未建議何種特別指施，同時，聞貝氏代表團之團員，希望美國於四月開始十五個月援華計劃，可提高至五億美元。惟美人一致認爲：中國人士所作對於渠等有利之數字解釋，可能係錯誤者。</p>
<p>中美意見有異　此間若干中國官司員仍希望，在國外援助之外，中國政府亦可能使美國進出口銀行批准其以前所提出，與五億貸款有關計劃下之貸款。中美官員雙方，對於如何促成經濟復興一點，意見相距極遠，此項歧見對於美限計劃之最後形式究有何種影響，本週以內尚不能明瞭。但貝氏代表團仍在希望，渠等能影響美國最後之決定至若干程度，迄今爲止，貝氏旣非與國務卿馬歇爾，又非與副國務　洛維特會晤。渠對任何計劃尙無能爲力，同時，若干國會議員現向國務院使用壓力，力主援　之衆議員周以德稱：除非國務部不久以後即將計劃送交國會，否則渠即公開要求政府宣佈對華援助計劃。</p>
<h3>我技術代表會晤美官員　秘密討論援華計劃　胡佛建議援外案包括中國</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿一日電〕關係方面稱：美國援華計劃，現正由我技衛代表團與美國務院以「秘密方式」在此進行討論。廿一日晨十時三十分，我代表團由貝祖詒與李　率領，在美國務院與美方官員舉行會議時，對援華計劃曾作初步之「技衛討論」。國務院方面解釋稱：中美雙方之會談，不能即嚴格稱之爲談判，因不時須在國務院以外進行非正式之討論。又據稱：因過去美方官員與外國代表間凡涉及財政援助計劃之討論，皆以秘密方式進行，故此次援華討論亦不能例外。國務院方面又堅稱：在初步會談中，國務院官員僅聽取中國代表團關於中國財政情形，以及中國政府已採取何種步驟，以改善此種情形之報告。傳我代表自十五日抵此後，尚未向美方提出任何計劃或要求，我政府是否擬有一項計劃提交美國務院，則尚不悉。又據稱：雙方之討論，尙未達到美國務院即以其援華計劃預示中國代表之階段。消息靈通方面稱：在國務院向國會提出最後要求前，中國代表團自可獲得機會一睹國務院計劃之藍本，其所列舉之款項，將超出三億美元。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕前總統胡佛廿一日在參院外委會要求國會擴大馬歇爾計劃範圍，俾及於中國·日本·朝鮮與德國，並將最初十五個月援歐復興經費六十八億美元再予核减。胡氏稱：此舉不致削弱美國經濟與破壞世界復興，援歐之糧食·煤斤·肥料及棉花三十億元，應悉數作為贈款，蓋無保證之貸款殆難償還。四年援歐計劃附帶精神上之約束，實屬不智，吾人不能以任何觀念强迫獨立自主民族接受。此外，官民雙方必須設立民主，共和兩黨聯合委員會，以管理歐洲十六國·中國·日本·朝鮮及德國等援助事宜。</p>

<h3>斥英國的四項要求</h3>
<p>本報廿一日南京電，英國駐華大使館於　獲倫敦　令之後，　　　大使即以　會一件送達我國外交部，對於廣州沙面不幸事件，提出四項要求：　中國政府應對沙面事件負其責任，　澈底調査此一不幸事件之起因，並須嚴懲兇犯；　　償損失並　恤受損害之英僑；　保證以後不發生類似事件。同時又據路透社二十日倫敦電，英國國務大臣　克尼爾在下院答覆　員問話時，亦言涉及廣州沙面事件，並表示英國政府已向中國當局提出賠償，澈査，懲兇及保證等四項要求；足以證明本報報這的準確　眞實。沙面不幸事件是因九龍事件而發生，我國外交當局對於九龍事件，一再向英國政府交涉，倫敎方面始終保持緘默，而今忽對沙而事件，竟先提出四項要求，企圖移轉交涉重點於沙面事件，使我們不能不認爲英方有「倒果　因」的企圖。英國外交，素有辣毒之稱，我國外交當局不可不提高　覺，千萬不能將此有因果關係之九龍事件與沙面事件　　處理。</p>
<p>我們平心靜氣，就事論事，　面事件的發生，完全是港　暴行所致，沒右九能事件，就不會右沙面事件發生，理由至爲明顯，故不特中國政府不負任何責任，而且其全部責任應由英國政府負之。就法理而言，九龍城的等轄權屬於中國政府，是英國政府不能否認的事實，香港當局要拆除九龍舊城內之房屋，旣屬非法，且侵犯我國對於九龍城之主權；港警對於手無寸鐵的居民，開槍射擊，更是一稱不可饒恕的暴行。即使舍法理而言人情，戰後中英兩國，均在艱難困苦的時期，在經濟上莫不提倡節約，而求民生的安定；香港當局罔　中國人民生活的困苦，竟以「衛生」「防火」爲名，而欲拆除九龍舊城內的房屋，改爲公園；其不切實際，不合時宜，是顯而易見的。港力或謂，曾指定其他地區准原右居民另建房屋，已右補救辦法，九　　　似不應再堅持不走；但在物質　件靑　貧困的今日，　地另　房屋，也不是一件容易的事情，　方對此，不僅不能體　中國人民的痛苦，反而用暴力　　，這種行為，不論從那一角度去觀察，不能不認爲，這是英國帝國主義者面目的再　露。</p>
<p>港方對待九龍居民，充分暴露出帝國主義對待殖民地的作風；對於戰後力求獨立自主的中國人民，自難容忍，尤其是一般知識份子，對於港九的特殊地位，早已要求政府收回，而使中國在領土完整上，不再有任何缺陷。所以粵滬曁各地相繼發生反英示威運動，咎在英方侵我主權及港　的暴行，英國政府實不能責　任何方面；絕不能將一切責任諉諸中國政府。而且沙面英國領事館的被焚，是共匪利用羣衆運動而作的越軌行動，當局已獲有充分的證據，上海英商字林西報十九日社論「共匪的鼓動」，也承認這是共匪之所爲，且謂共匪的用意，不僅在搗亂地方秩序，而且含右挑撥離間的陰謀，企圖推波助瀾，擴大中英間的不幸事件。在此戡亂期間，防範共匪的亂舉，固爲中國谷地方政府的責任，但是港方造成事端，激起中國人民的憤怒，發生羣衆運動，奸人乘機作亂，臨時措手不及，自難防範。何况在沙面事件發生之後，中國政府即通令全國各地政府，加緊防範共匪搗亂，並嚴密保護英僑生命財產；京·滬··平·津學生，雖然也舉行反英示威運動，但均未發生類似沙而的不幸事件，由此可見，中國政府實無責任可言，而研究其亂源之由來，乃在港警察的暴行所促成，港方無論如何强辯，對於沙面不幸事件的發生，終不能辭其咎。</p>
<p>至於講到懲凶賠償，共匪的乘機搗亂，不但妨害地方秩序，而且破壞中英邦交，其所犯的罪行，當可依照我國刑法治罪，好在縱火焚燒英國領事館的凶手，均已逮捕；自可移交法院，依法處理。但是我們要聲明：懲治縱火的共匪，是我國的內政，不容外人　　，英國自不能且不應要求我國加以嚴懲。準此而論，英國提出此項要求，實在是一種不友好的舉動，我國萬難　變，其次是賠償英僑損失，英僑是無事的，　到意外的損害，殊屬不幸，我們站在人道的立塲，應予以同情，對其損　，自可酌量予以賠償，但須　　國際慣例處理，我國外交部情　司長時　　已表示我國外交黨局將循此途徑辦理，　為一　明的　置。</p>
<p>英國外交當局拋開九龍問題不談，而對沙面事件提出四項要求，實爲不　的舉動，不　舍本逐末，不僅不能解決中英兩國間的懸案，而且徒使中英交涉發生波折，對於中英邦交的前途恐將發生不利的影響。吾人對此，不能不表示遺憾。　後英團政府，在工黨的主持之下，不論在內政外交方面所採取的開明措置，無一不爲世人所喝彩。尤其是英國的遠東政策，不僅能因勢利導，而且具有遠大的眼光，其允許印度緬甸獨立，均爲以前英國歷屆政府所不敢爲者，但工黨竟爲之，這不能不欽佩艾德禮首相的賢明決策；香港九龍理應歸還　國，不僅美國野朝承認此爲當然之理，就是英國開明人士，亦以爲然。但是工黨政府遲遲未能履行其君子協定應盡之義務，將港九交還中國，而在中英邦交上保留此一汚點，實使吾人大感不解。英人或謂中國內亂未已，交還港九須待來日，這種說法，實無理由可言，老實說，英國交還港九與中國內政何涉？顯然是一種掩飾之詞。所以我們要求英國外交當局，應該放大眼光，高瞻遠矚，一方面要看淸目前的遠東局勢，另一方面也要有自知之明，戰後的英國在遠東應不應再採取帝國主義的政策？配不配再保留其戰前的殖民地？我們因爲珍惜英國在戰時給我們的溫暖，所以特別願意與英國保持友好關係，不願九龍事擴大；此在英國，也應該爲中英雙方想想；百年交惡的舊嫌豈可容其存在？平等新約的精神豈能不予尊重？率直地說，英國對於沙面事件，更應抱息事寗人的態度，使大事化小事，使小事化無事，常此中國人民情緒高緊之際，豈可再提要求激動中國人民的情緒？要之，英國外交常局對於此二事件，尙有重加考慮之必要</p>

<h3>勃里奇致馬歇爾函</h3>
<p>（上接一版）勃里奇函中聲稱：「惟有立即向國會提出一項保護美國人民對於中國獨立之重大關切之計劃，始能造成人民對於當局遠東政策之良好信心，並使吾人獲得充份之機會，以仔細研究援助計劃」。</p>
<p>勃里奇回憶稱：馬歇爾在去年十一月世日參。衆兩院外交委員會之聯合報告曾中曾稱：確切之援華計劃，正在準備之中，並將及早提出國會。氏讀謂：助理國務卿塞普曾於十二月十七日出席參院撥款委員會報告稱：國務院準備於國會常會開始之際，提出一項中國方案。氏之兩件稱：「自國會之常會開幕以來，業已兩週，而國務院迄未向國會提出援華方案。參院撥款委員會委員由於信賴閣下及塞普先生之聲明，其對於臨時援助方案之行動，業已受到影響」。</p>
<p>勃里奇提醒馬歇爾謂：在撥款　員會聽取報告時，代表總統特別調査中國局勢之魏德邁將軍，曾作證稱：渠不以爲美國在此數年間已實踐對華所作之諾言，並稱：渠認爲美國應以軍用物資及　濟援助給予中國，此時巳屬急不容　。勃里奇稱：國務院遠東事務司長白長華所作之答覆，語多「規避」，有令人覺得「政府對委員會實欠坦白」之感想。勃里奇之函中續稱：「政府對付中國及在中國問題中對付國會之誠意，目下在懷疑中。抑有進者，美國人民之重要利益，巳因我政府對遠東戰後局勢之判斷不準，而受到危害。政府似乎對蘇聯認作「愛好和平之民主國家」，對中共認作僅屬農田改革者，並對軍火與子彈運送中國政府一事，拒絕出口許可證一年，凡此種種，均足以危害吾人對日勝利之成果。今日蘇維埃政府利用中共爲工具，有統治全部中國之威脅。中國國內之戰爭，現已成爲一種流血，饑餓與破壞之戰爭。」</p>

<h3>英法向荷比盧建議　組西歐安全同盟　英外相抨擊蘇擴張政策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿二日廣播：英外相貝文今日向下院提出警告，認爲仳界已臨「嚴重危險」。渠謂蘇聯對希臘所作之種種言論，純屬謬論，至指責蘇聯刻正全副力量擴張勢力。蘇聯以前之目的尙以共產黨控制　　爲限，今已向西歐方面擴大矣。蘇聯　指　英國之外交政策日益接近美國，其用意亦即在此。貝文謂英國外交政策有三項原則：　任何一國不得控制歐洲；　舊式之均勢觀念應予打破；　歐洲各國實行合作致力復興。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕貝文外相於廿二日下午下院開始兩日外交辯論之初，發表兩小時之、演說，要點將如下述：　西歐：就英美之弗蘭　福協議有所稱明；　歐洲同盟：貝文將宣布英法向荷比盧建議締結同盟，以廢止關稅　　，建立西歐安全制度；　英國在巴勒斯坦則將採取之重要行動；　答覆蘇聯對英國政策之批評；　馬歇爾計劃。</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿二日電〕戰時首相邱吉爾出席下院時，曾引起全院注意。反劉黨領袖邱吉爾健康極佳，於詢問時問進入下院，當時發問議員與卞答人均皆對彼致詞歡迎。預料邱氏將在外交辯論中發表重要言論，蓋氏一向主張歐洲各國應右密切聯繫也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕此間外交界人士相信，英·　業巳決定向荷蘭·比利時·盧森堡三國政府建議擴大英·法於一九四七年三月四日在鄧扣克所訂之英法防守同盟五十年公約。至於荷·比·盧三國，官方雖不能證實此項建議已正式向荷·比·盧政府提出，然消息靈通方而均相信，前一報告之可靠。査貝文及皮杜爾均將於廿二日在本國國會由發表軍要外交政策演說，屆時即將提及擴大防守同盟公約之事。官方人七之對前說持緘默態度，其故殆即在此。</p>
<h3>西歐防守公約　遙對東歐同盟</h3>
<p>消息靈通方面並信五國政府，且已從事非正式的準備談判，以爲擴次同盟公約之部署。貝文於去年三月在鄧扣克簽畢英法同盟公約，赴莫斯科出席四强外長會議，途經布魯塞爾時，已曾與比政府談及締結類似盟約之可能性，其後荷·比·盧三國訂立關稅同盟，關係益臻緊密，因此同盟之擴大至於三國，已形成一當然的發展。外交界人士，於研究此舉之重耍性時，認爲五國如成立防守同盟，將藉長期防守條約，而加強西歐被德侵略國之安全，法國及其北鄰較小國家之安全需要，因此可以獲得滿足，就另一方面言，同盟之擴大至於五國，即等於基於軍事條約美務，而成立「西歐集團」，此固蘇聯之所最忌者。就實際上言，西歐防守公約之締結，雖以防止德國再侵略爲其正式宣布的目標，然其成立適緊接東歐同盟網擴大建立之後。而後者之正式宣佈的目標，固亦爲防止德國之再侵略，再査一九四二年之英蘇明約及一九四四年之英法明約均有聯擊東西條約系統的規定，惟在德國問題未獲協議前，此項聯繫殊元實現之望耳。</p>
<h3>馬卿談援歐計劃　認為美陸軍部曾予充分合作　拉丁美洲仍將獲得援助</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞華盛頓廿一日電〕國務卿馬歇爾本日在記者招待會中討諭目前世界局勢之若干方面，包括英國關於德境英美佔領區內糧食缺乏之照會，法國對英美佔區經濟合作之態度，巴勒斯坦情形，拉丁美洲在歐洲復興計劃中所扮演之角色及其他關於歐洲復興計劃之問題。</p>
<p>此次記者招待會適為馬歇爾就任國務卿之一週紀念，渠稱渠至此方憶及此事。渠又以取笑之口　稱：渠担任現職，似已有一年半，而非僅一年。關於德國：馬卿允許提早考慮英外交大臣貝文所提關於德國西部糧食缺乏之照會。該照會之內容並未在華盛頓透露，但據非正式之消息稱：照曾中對於德國工人對糧食减少情形之不安，表示關念。馬歇爾稱：該照會仍在硏究中，如何答覆，尚未起稿，但美政府對於糧食缺乏之嚴重性，與貝文之意見相同。渠稱：渠對於貝文所提之建議，甚感興趣，貝文之意見爲向斯干底那維亞國家獲取魚類，以補充德國之　譜。杜勒斯星期二在參院外交委員會席上提出質詢時，曾涉及美國陣軍佔領常局未能爲西歐經濟復興而實行合作之說法，馬歇爾頃加以答覆謂：依渠觀之，華盛頓之陸軍部與德國之美國軍政府從未有妨碍歐洲復興之行動。按杜氏曾向參院委會建議一點，即苟其行政權由陸軍移交予國務院管理，德國西部之歸入歐洲復興計劃將更易於實現。馬歇爾向新聞記者保證，謂陸軍部深知歐洲復興計劃意義，並取完全合作態度。渠指出草擬歐洲復興計劃之各委會中，均有陸軍部代表參加。馬歇爾業已表示國務院有於七月間担任行政責任之可能。渠稱：渠已與法國大使龐納獲得關於英美兩國對於英美佔領區經濟管制協定定諒解，並拒絕作更多之說明。渠並拒絕對巴勒斯坦之叙黎亞軍　事有所評　，渠答覆關於巴魯　星期一在參院委員會報告會中提出修正歐洲復興方案之建議稱：渠尙未獲得時間予以硏究。雖然渠認爲此項建議係屬自然之事，惟渠稱拉丁美洲未能包括於歐洲復興方案而表示不滿事，實屬不當，因按照歐洲復興計劃，將有數十億金元用於拉丁美洲，而此事無疑將有良好效果也。</p>
<p>胡佛領導共和黨　將攻擊援歐計劃</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕在前總統胡佛之呼籲下，塔虎脫等廿名共和黨領袖，廿二日集議討論大事，修改馬歇爾計劃：胡佛曾向參院外交委員會提出一對馬歇爾計劃尖刻之批評書，渠對政府之援歐計劃逐條駁斥，渠建議杜魯門第一期馬歇爾計劃六十八億之要求削减四十億。僉信馬歇爾計劃之敵人立即將結集於「胡佛計劃」之周圍對政府提出攻擊。塔虎脫告合衆社記者稱：「胡佛之意見甚對，與余以前之主張相吻合。」</p>
<p>胡佛對援歐建議　杜魯門表示反對</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿二日廣播：華盛頓訊，杜魯門總統對前總統胡佛就歐洲復與計劃所提之建議，堅法表示反對。總統不願舉出理由，惟告記者請此等建議之不能適用，至爲明顯。但杜氏對政治家前輩巴魯福於本週初所提供之意見，則表贊同，此即美國應與參加馬歇爾計劃各國成立防衛聯盟是也。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿二日廣播：華盛頓訊，美國前戰時戰略服務局局長杜諾文今日在參議外交要員會席上作證，認爲蘇聯已發動世界性之「挑撥性戰爭」，必須加强馬歇爾計劃予以對付。蘇聯藉意工者，賣國者與潛伏性敵人之助，並利用苦難與餓荒，業已獲得重大成功。美蘇之正式開火並非不可避免，但目前已在進行另一種戰爭，此項戰爭非由紅軍担任，而由蘇聯共產黨與世界各地之第五縱隊所從事者也。</p>
<h3>馬卿告希駐美大使　美重視希臘局勢　正注意希陸軍供應問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿一日電〕可靠方面息，馬歇爾國務卿答覆希臘駐美大使最近向美國提出之備忘錄時，謂美國政府正在硏究每一措施，以面臨希臘局勢之發展。馬卿告希臘大使謂，渠對於希臘陸軍之供應問題，親自加以密切注意。渠當盡力使希陸軍得以有效應付「馬柯斯」之叛亂。</p>
<h3>伊拉克政府宣布　不批准英伊新約　巴勒斯坦分治案執行有困難</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴格達廿二日電〕伊拉克攝政會同議會正副議長與國王舉行一小時緊急會議後，即向全國廣播稱，伊拉克將不批准新英伊條約，蓋其不能保證國家之權利。</p>
<p>另據路透社電稱，伊攝政並已電召赴英簽訂英伊新約之伊總理加布爾即返倫敦。伊拉克人民日來已迭有反對該條約之示威，報紙對該約亦多抨擊，國民民主黨，自由黨，獨立黨，亦莫不反對該約。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴格達廿二日電〕伊拉克內閣預料將提出辭呈。</p>
<p>〔社成功湖廿一日電〕英帝國廿一日通知聯合國稱，英國爲安全計，必須綱續限制猶太人移住巴勒斯坦，幷拒絕聯合國大會所請求開放移民港口。此項英國計劃係由英代表賈德幹提出者。賈氏强調稱，英國將繼讀限制猶太人每月一千五百人移入聖地，直至英國統治結束，故英國在調解終止前，必須防止難民船隻在泰利阿芙靠岸。</p>
<p>另據聯合社常稱，聯合國巴勒斯坦委會以巴勒斯坦分治案之執行，第一步即遇難關，故不得不向安全理事會提出報告。該委員會將於下星期初向安理會報告其目前所遭遇之種種困難。</p>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷廿一日電〕六百至七百名阿刺伯人襲擊推漢姆猶人區已歷二天，廿一日與英國激戰數小時後，己被驅回黎巴嫩邊境。此次爲阿人反對聖地分治以還第一次大規模及有組織之襲擊。</p>
<h3>美國務院奉令發表　德秘密檔案內容　蘇德曾討論瓜分英帝國</h3>
<p>〔聯合盛頓廿一日電〕國務院今日率國務卿馬歇爾令，公布英美軍抄獲之納粹德國全部機密檔案共二百六十件，長三百六十二頁，將蘇聯常局與希特勒平分東歐之詳情暴露無遺。</p>
<p>其中並有希特勒，德外長星賓特洛甫與日本外長松岡洋右之談話錄，希特勒與里賓特洛甫曾勸松岡不與蘇聯談判日蘇條約，慫恿日本派兵南下進攻新加坡。談話錄中記載里資　　甫之言曰：「羅斯福深知對日攻擊之不可能，故不致因日軍進攻新加坡而對日宣戰；日本可乘機佔領菲律賓，如此即可對羅斯福之威望予以嚴重打擊。」希特勒則允於美國萬一宣戰時，德國與日共同作戰。關於蘇聯部份之秘密案卷，可歸納爲如下數種事實：　蘇聯曾大量支援德國對西方作戰，接濟之物資達數十萬噸，自始至終博取德國「友誼」，並助德國設法使土耳其保守中立。　蘇聯與希特勒商定將美國以及英國排斥於歐洲，亞洲及非洲之外。　蘇聯要求在博斯波洛斯及韃靼海峽範圍之內取得軍事基地，並須承認巴統及巴庫南至波斯港之油田爲蘇聯利益所在，因此德蘇分手，並暗伏德國日後進攻蘇聯之起因。此種秘密案卷第一件即爲蘇聯初次謀與納粹樹立更密切關係之正式報告，紐倫堡國際軍事法庭審訊德國戰爭犯時，蘇聯曾阻止其發表；其中並有蘇聯外長莫洛托夫與里賓特洛甫簽訂之瓜分彼蘭密約，劃分德蘇兩國在東歐之勢力範圍，最後一件涉及希特勒　　　　　　　　·國務院謂，　　　　　　　　　　此攻入柏　　　　　　分交中抄張，茲予　　　　　　　　。此舉　與美　　　　　　　　　，便　然予以公布，實　外交上一要　；其中一件標明「萬分緊急，萬分　密」字樣，領　國駐蘇大使舒倫僅於一九四〇年十一月廿六日之機要報告，謂　洛托夫同意簽訂四國（德·　·　·日）政治經濟合作條約，惟須接受其四項條件，其中一項要求日本放棄其對於北庫頁烏煤曠油田權利，另一文件係希特勒　舒倫堡於一九四一年四月廿八　之談話紀錄，內稱：「元首　　岡訪莫斯科時，余已在該處，　　俄人對於日蘇協定之意見；余答稱俄人甚爲欣　，即使不得不　步亦無關。史達林曾面告松岡日，渠已與納粹有約，未　與英法合作」云。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕德秘密檔案中透露莫洛托夫與希特勒兩人，貧討論分裂世界爲德蘇義日勢力圖並瓜分英帝國之計劃。</p>
<p>據番國務院發表此項文件後，英法美所獲其他德外部秘密文件，就將洛續發表，正由英·美·法編輯各一人加以整理中，英國外交部發言人於宣布英·美·法三國政府此項意向時，特聲明此舉僅在顯示該種文件之歷史重要性，不具任何政治作用。渠並表示歡迎蘇聯政府亦能參加此種工作。</p>
<h3>朝鮮自由選舉後　佔領軍全部撤退　聯合國代表團提出保證</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿一日電〕聯合國赴漢代表國主席梅農，今晚對全韓廣播時稱：即將舉行之選舉中，全體朝鮮人民均可獲有完全之選舉權，否則聯合國赴韓代表團即整裝離韓。渠謂：吾人寗可歸去，而不願成爲欺騙性選舉之無聊。</p>
<p>旁觀者並謂，此原則必須適用於南韓及北韓，本代表國不祗認北韓　入度吾人僉月之為一必須消除之政治畸形現象，自吾人視之，朝鮮乃係不可分割之一個整體，渠向朝鮮人民保證自由選舉後，將　之以韓境內全部佔領軍之撤退。渠謂：外國軍隊在最好之情况下，仍爲刺激之因素，在惡劣之情況下，更為一種威脅。渠稱：聯合國赴韓代表團，已完成對其職務之　本準備，刻已準備開始處理朝鮮問題。</p>
<h3>蘇如推出北韓美有應付計劃　朝鮮美軍總司令宣布</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿一日電〕朝鮮美佔領區司令霍奇，今對記者稱，朝鮮南部業巳光復兩載有半，美國對此新生而分裂之國家，雖曾一再予以援助，然在經濟上仍有賴於日本。霍奇將軍本日承認單在朝鮮南部一區，無法促成經濟之獨立，霍氏對於蘇軍萬一撤出北部，將採取何種　施一節，拒絕發表意見。頃漢　一　·人言　　，認為　軍有不先通知驟然撤出模樣，惟霍氏表示，美軍已有隨時應付任何情勢之計劃。</p>
<h3>美財長主張　穩定西歐幣值</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕美財長史奈德今日出席正在審査援歐復興方案之衆議院外交委員會陳述對該方案之意見，主張由參加方案之歐洲國家採取穩定幣値的迅速而强有力的措施，俟歐洲國家完成此等適當的步驟後，美國除將擬給予歐洲的援助外，並將給予貸款，以購買歐洲復興方案下的物資。渠主張在美關與每一歐洲受援國所訂之協定中，規定穩定該國幣值，及維持適當外匯率的措施。渠承認調整匯率為極複雜的問題，預料在歐洲復興的過程中可望實現。</p>

<p>〔路透社科隆廿二日電〕二十一日實行罷工一天以抗議糧食缺乏之科隆工人八萬名，已於二十二日復工，惟於週一起即行罷工之軍車工人，尙不知能否全部復工，彼等係爲要求獲得重力工人之糧食配給量而實行罷工，在罷工期問科隆區並未發生動亂。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京廿二日專電〕據時事新報載稱：美國商人一批一百二十人，定下月來日，調査投資於日本工商業之可能性，該報並未透露上述消息之來源。又據記者獲悉，盟總之官員正在廣泛調查以前外商之投資，俾供即將來日之外國商人之參考。日政府現正從事種種準備，以款等此批美商，希望彼等在日本投資，協助日本之工業復原。</p>
<h3>片山施政方針　內容極為空泛</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕日參議院定今（二十二日）午後三時舉行全體會議，片山首相之施政演說後，由大野幹事長發表談話稱：「今日之片山首相之施政演說，雖涉及產業，通貨膨脹，行政整理等廣泛之範圍，然皆與現狀遊離，始終爲說敎演說；雖云增加生產，復興產業，而無任何具體之施策。此爲其演說之致命傷，而違反國民對政治，經濟等所預期之希望。」</p>
<h3>松岡洋右信口雌黃　黃顯光氏予以駁斥</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕新聞局長董顯光談，華盛頓所透露之秘密納粹文件中，謂日本前外相松岡洋右在一九四一年曾與蔣主席有「私人接觸」之事稱，自一九二七年國民政府定都於南京之後，蔣主席即未晤松岡洋右。董氏稱，自一九三七年日本侵略中國後，蔣主席即從未接見任何日本人，松岡之言妄也。</p>

<h3>法閣緊急會議　商法郎貶值　英反對法郎貶值措施</h3>

<h3>聯合國情報及新聞自由會議</h3>
<p>— 本報料室</p>
<p>聯合國情報及新聞自由會議，定於本年三月二十三日在瑞士日內瓦舉行。會期約需四五星期，長短須視商討情形而定。每聯合國會員國得派正代表五人，副代表五人，專家顧問若干人。代表將包括「報紙，無綫電廣播，電影，及他種傳佈情報的媒介物之實際從事或富右經驗人員」。聯合國現有會員國五十餘，每國各派正副代表十人，巳有五百數十人，非會員國亦可派員參加，不過無權投票。就出席人員之職業而言，會議塲中，自必人才濟濟，盛極一時。</p>
<p>我國出席聯合國經濟曁社會理事會代表張彭春博士，鑒於此會議之重要，除向政府報告請示外，曾於去年十月間，乘中航機首次開航中美綫，我國新聞界前往美國時，特召開座談會一次，陳述此會議之性質，俾彼等將此會議之使命等消息，帶回國內，以喚起新聞界之注意。</p>
<p>聯合國大會在一九四六年十二月十四日曾有決議案，召集國際情報自由會議。經濟曁社會理事會第五屆會議在一九四七年八月十五日，亦有決議案，進行召開此會。此二決議案即爲聯合國情報自由會議之根據。我國代表所應有之準備工作，亦當以此二決議案主文為南針。第一決議案中有情報自由之定　，實現情報自　之條件，各國代表國中應有之人員等。第二決議案中有此會議之組織方法，臨時議事日程，人權委員會情報自由小組委員會開會日期，及向經濟曁社會理事會致送報告，幷商討處理新聞紙張缺乏問題等。臨時議事日程，內容非常充實，列舉之原則與問題，皆經前述情報自由小組委員會中各國專家詳細考訂。將來舉行會議時，此日程即爲商討辯論之對象。就目前言，我國代表團應準備者，亦即在此二決議案及議事日程中所載之一切。</p>
<p>前述情報自由小組委員會，乃計劃此會議之機構。一月十九日，小組委員會開會，討論之主題爲情報自由之槪念，此乃不易獲得各方同意之難題。二丹二日，經濟曁社會理事會將舉行第六屆會議，至時有何決議，現在尙難預料。若小組委員會有關於情報自由概念之新報告，提供理事會商討，則理事會當有相當決議案產生，而決議案之內容，或足爲各國新聞界硏究與準備之對象。在會議尚朱舉行前，我人當然不能作肯定之推論，然而食議之結果，値得我人注意，則可斷言。</p>
<p>聯合國情報自由會議舉行時，依據去年聯合國經濟曁社會理事會第五屆會議之決議案，在全體會議之下，須設立五個委員會，處理會務。一爲總務委員會。此委員會之組織，由會議主席，副主席，及各委員會主席構成之，其主要任務則爲向全體會議提出右關議事臼程之建議，將各種議決草案發交各主要委員會，並調整各委員會問之工作。除總務委員會外，另有四主要委員會，專管會務之技術方面問題。第一委員會討論關於新聞及其他情報機關之基本任務，情報自由之原則，以及其他各主要委員會所共有之一般問題。此委員會負責審議臨時議事日程中第一項（關於情報自由原則之一般討論），第二項（關於情報機關在採集，傳遞，廣播情報脫去束縛時所應重視之基本原則），及第六項（審議草擬情報機關權利義務之憲章）。第二委員會討論關於採集情報與國際傳遞問題，其主要工作爲審議臨時議事日程中第三項（便利採集情報之措施）及第四項（便利國際傳遞情報之措施）。第三委員會討論關於自由出版及接收情報問題，審議臨時議事日程中第五項（關於自由版及接收情報之措施），及第八項（關於設立官方或半官方情報處後如何使他國接獲情報問題）。第四委員會討論法律問題與機構繼續問題，其工作爲臨時譏事日程中第六項（審議草擬情報機關權利義務之憲章），第七項（審議能否設立永久機構以促進正確情報之自由流通），及第九項（審議採用何種行動方式，偵會議之建議案最能生效，是否可用大會決議案，國際公約，雙邊協定，抑由國家自定適當法律，或用其他方式），此外並須解決其他委員會所交議之法律問題。</p>
<p>我國代表在未出國前，　好先擬提案，在會議尚未開始時，分發各國代表。他國提案，亦可事先取得，方易　商對付。</p>
<p>茲將此會之由來，性質，舉行日期及過去商討經過，與將來開會之議事日程，分別介紹於次：</p>
<p>會議由來　按聯合國憲章，其主要機構爲大會，安全理事會，經濟及社會理事會，託管理事會，國際法院及秘書處。聯合國情報及新聞自由會議，係於一九四六年十二月十四日，在大會中議決核准，飭經濟曁社會理事會進行召開者。</p>
<p>會議性質及舉行日期　情報及新聞自由，乃基本人機之一，亦爲促成世界和平與進步之主要因素，但同時又常避免濫用，探求事實，不存偏私，以造成健全之世界與論，謀取國際間之諒解與合作。故大會議決召開情報及新聞自由會議，　目的在就情報自由之槪念中，擬定其權利，義務，及慣例等問題之意見；　出席代表，應爲報紙，廣播，電影及其他傳佈情報的媒介物之實際從事或富有經驗人員；　日期定於一九四七年年底以前，在經濟曁社會理事會所擇定之地點舉行，俾該理事會得在大會下屆常會中提出報告。</p>

<h3>建國復興開始　希望善為運用</h3>
<p>典　於爆竹　及奏樂聲中開始，主席秦汾目先致詞稱：以往戰敗國對於戰勝國之賠償，皆用金錢方式，但第一次世界大戰以後之經驗，證明此種方式，徒然使戰敗國無力負擔而引起另一次戰爭，故此次聯合國決定改用合理辦法，賠償以不妨碍戰敗國人民生活必需爲原則。日本方面，首先將某兵工設備取出一部份賠償，其中我國分得一半，另一半則由菲列濱，荷蘭，英國等攤分。今日我人接收第一批運到之機器，可謂乃建國復興之開始，希望政府與人民通力合作，好好利用來從事建設工作。關於分配方式，有人主張應全部賠償與後方工廠，但政府認爲在抗戰期間全國人民均受到損失，故均應有亨受賠償之權。因此將一部份分配給國家機關，其中四分之一則交由經濟部轉售與民營工廠，民間損失將來常俟機器作價以後，再予分攤。</p>
<p>正義終於戰勝強權</p>
<p>由来賓　學遂，徐學禹相繼致詞，均認為賠償物資獲取非易，希望各接收機關切勿浪費，應好好利用於復興建設事業。</p>

<p>徵收優待金製定報告書</p>
<p>至兵役協會前會同上海國管區派員，分往各區保督促征收免緩役征召壯丁及無出征壯丁住戶優待金之工作，已各一段落，頃並就各區保征收情形及征收成績，製定詳細報告到會，該會將據以轉報市政府，按征收成績優劣，分別予以獎懲。</p>
<h3>墨綠皮包羞掩面　鮮紅指甲染油污　洋囡囡恢復自由　沈鞏藏搶押究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紅舞女「洋囡囡」李珍，與沈鞏偉二人桃色糾紛，層出不窮。頃又被沈妻毛秀珍以通　罪嫌，扭送靜安寺路警察分局。昨日上午十一時許解送地檢處偵查。　沈娶妻毛秀珍，已有兩孩，一已兩歲，一尚在襁褓中。惟沈不事生產，性好遊蕩，與李　姘居於愚園路一一一二弄四號，雙方雖時起勃谿，但旋即言歸於好。本月二十日深夜十一時許，沈李二人舞罷後，沈邀李進點，李飲酒過量，沈乃　李同車回陜西北路五四九號沈寓，入沈父臥室睡眠。事被毛氏發覺，投報靜安寺路警察分局司法股調查，以沈李二人有通　嫌疑，昨臼解送地檢處。李着　青底白圓點綢旗袍，外罩豹皮鑲海虎絨邊大衣，尼龍絲襪，咖啡色　皮鞋，因　為記者攝影，以墨綠色　皮皮包遮面。沈　深藍色麥爾登呢長衫，西裝褲，黑皮鞋。二人解至地檢處後，即禁入「小牢監」內。此待已有　三竊盜二十餘人踞坐其中，見此一對摩登男女蒞臨，莫不表示驚異。旋又提出　印指紋，紅指甲上染滿油汚·李因受刺激太深，嚶嚶啜泣·沈鞏偉則神色自若，川抹布將手上油墨拭去，將抹布交李揩拭。下午三時方正檢察官開庭，據李供稱：與沈曾一度發生關係，並否認同居。二十臼晚被沈用酒灌醉，云赴俱樂部，不料將伊送至沈萬。伊因沉醉，神智不清，惟有聽其擺佈，故此次責任應由沈鞏偉負責。做舞女職業，對客人不得不敷衍，幷無妨害沈之家庭意思·沈供稱：與李相識已有數載，同居一年，平素頗爲恩愛，因與妻子性情不　，時起爭吵，故毛氏藉此　　　。庭上因據警局調查，曾於沈家中抄出無照三號左輪手槍一　，子彈九粒，問沈藏此槍是何用意？沈答是買來弄白相的，別無用意。庭上因沈私藏火，情節重大，降　敢押，飭率交現金保二千萬元，改至本月廿四日開庭偵查。</p>

<h3>美國浮來一座海上行宮　克利扶蘭號巡禮　溫暖如春佈置富麗美觀　一頓晚餐菜六十餘種</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕美國太平洋航錢上最大·最富麗的郵船「克利扶蘭總統」號，昨晨處女航到達上海。這「海上大飯店」所以吸引了數百位中外仕女去參觀而使他們樂不忘返，實在有其値得流連的原因。</p>
<p>當你一進乳白色的「克利扶蘭」，立刻就給你一個印象，是「一所漂亮富麗的大飯店」，溫暖如春。右邊是電梯，兩旁是金色鐵攔桿的樓梯，左邊是問訊處·事務處。靠牆排着沙發。牆壁玻璃橱內，陳設着花草·古玩。非常美觀。上樓就是飯廳·臥艙·休息室等等</p>
<h3>魚蝦牡蠣閹雞　來自世界各地</h3>
<p>該輸共可載客五百五十二位，頭等艙三百三十位，三等艙二百二十二位。並沒有二等。頭等艙乘客的亨受，可說在中國甚至遠東最大的旅館由也不容　得到的。飯廳有二大間，一日「加利福尼亞」廳，一名「馬哥博　」　。他們的菜，稱得上山珍海味，祗一張菜單就即刷精　，五彩對面，而且每頓都調換，在船上印刷。看看昨天晚餐的菜單，包括冷盆·湯·　素菜·甜點，一共有六十多種，任你挑選，即全部點也可以，祇要你吃得下。其中有的是阿拉斯加魚，香港　　，加利福尼亞　　，美國東部牡　等。應時鮮葉儘你大吃，都是包括在船費內的。另有一間呌「海面瞭望室」的，裏面可以吃點心·跳舞·看電影等。這類娛樂在三等艙也有設　的。</p>
<h3>水神廳上宴客　兒童另有樂園</h3>
<p>頭等艙另有一間呌「水神廳」，是專給乘客私人設宴請客用的，小小的一間房間，佈置極精雅，還有酒吧·此外還有休息室·起居室·及酒吧間好幾處·至於內部的設備，都是美國量新式最大方美觀的傢具，柔美的燈光，配上雅　的壁畫，厚絨的地　·大　的　拉斯的克玻璃門有一　厚·桌子儘面都是不怕火燙酒　，香烟頭放在上面，毫無痕跡。臥室雖然小了些，不過設備一應俱全。套間特別考究，包括臥室（內有三隻　床），浴室，和一間清靜的小起居室，可以望見海面。而床褥是橡皮胎一般的非彈　墊。</p>
<p>船上還有健身房，游泳池。另有「兒童樂園」，裏面有有無綫電，小輪船，小木屋各種玩具，甚至有小型的盥洗室。孩子們在早上八點至晚上八點之間，都可去玩。</p>
<p>船上雷達，無綫電以及安全設備，都儘其所能裝了上去。尤其特別的是到處裝有自動防火門，如果遇到一處起火，那扇門上有一機鈕，遇熱立即關起來隔絕，平時是關不上的。此外乘各可在船上甲板上到處通行，成一圓圈，而不如某他船隻兩邊關斷。</p>
<h3>船票空前昂貴　三千七百美金</h3>
<p>「一分價錢一分貨」，克利扶蘭的船票的昂貴是可想而知的。道次頭等環遊（來回票）票價爲美金三千七百五十元，三等來回是一千二百五十元。二月份起，（即下次）要漲百分之二十五，三等由上海至舊金山就要六百三十元了。票價不算，船上小帳也是很可觀的，照普通情形，飲些酒也要給百分之廿五小帳。</p>
<p>「克利扶蘭」號爲加利福尼亞伯利恒船公司所建造，費了美金二千一百五十萬元，歷時三年又半始告完成。船身長六〇九呎五又四分之三　，月底層至最高處共有八層之高，載黨二萬三千五百另七噸，本身　一萬另五百四十八噸。平時每小時走十九運，最高速度每小時行二十一　。船上除乘客五五二人外，尚有船員三五〇人，其中也有少數　國人，但都入美國籍的，因爲美海運規章規定美國船必須　用美國籍船員。</p>
<p>該輸每次來回須三十九天，每次路綫按向時針方向及背壁針方向相間而行。如此次由舊金山出發，經　香山，橫濱，上海，香港，馬尼刺，檀香山，返舊金山。下次由舊金山出發經檀香山，橫濱，上海，香港，馬尼刺，檀香山返舊金山</p>

<h3>立委選舉投票　今為最後一天　競爭宣傳漸趨平靜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲立委選舉第二日，午後雖有微雨，但選民投票較之前日爲踴躍。據佔計：昨日投票人數，在三十萬以上，今日爲最後一日，將更見踴躍。預計此次立委選舉之　數，將在一百萬票左右，與國大選舉相彷彿</p>
<p>昨日本市立委選舉，已進入短兵相接階段，宣傳之需要已减少，故街頭之宣傳車，已不如第一日之活躍。以投票之實際情勢而論，顏惠慶本身甚少做競選活動，其票數分散於各區，均佔有相當之比例。上海市政府之職員，亦全體票選顏氏。方志超王新衡之票，亦分散於各區，均頗佔優勢。馬樹禮與馬君碩，得蘇北同胞之助亦多。馬在各區得票頗夥。嵩山區爲本市人口集中之區，朱文德票數居於主體地位。女候選人中，鄭毓秀之公開及秘密競選活動，均不遺餘力。舉一實例言，渠在國際飯店門首所縣之自布橫額及紫色大燈籠，廣告費之代價開即達二千萬元，其他可想而知。因各主要候選人勢均力敵，故據右資格人士觀察，將來各中選者之間，得票數相差不過五千至一萬票之間而已。</p>
<p>北區票所糾紛打手扭送警局</p>
<p>作日區域選舉各投票所，大體秩序甚佳。惟昨日午後三時許北站中心國民學校投票所內，謝仁劍與曹使之選民發生嚴重糾紛。某部職員張鈞，毛平紹被人毆傷，即送海寗路醫院，打手則當塲被扭送警局，於身畔搜出無照會之手槍。謝仁　聞訊後即往謁吳市長，要求將打手扣留法辦。又徐家匯區虹橋小學內，昨日午後三時許亦有料紛，惟性質不嚴東，經處理調解後，尋即平息。謝仁釗於午復五時許，再往選舉事務所訪張曉崧，詳述北站毆打之事，並對記者談及對此次立委選舉之感想。據稱：「警察常干涉投票，使選舉之民主精神不能貫澈。以競選之宣傳費用而言，除顏惠慶周一志兩氏外，一般均渦於浪費，本人即已用去五六億，他人不必說。」</p>
<p>未領身份證者已有變通辦法</p>

<p>技　投票將延長大部都選會　甫</p>
<p>職業團體立委選舉各投票所投票情形，較前益見熱烈。技師團體之選票，昨晨始由京頒發到滬，選舉即於下午三時起在中正公園開始。本市京滬路局，濬浦局，工務，公用兩局等機關技師，昨均投曾養甫之票。名技師庾宗淮，過泰默昨亦投票選舉曾氏。該團體選舉截止日期，預定至今日下午六時止，如時間不够，將由選舉事務所呈請總監督酌予延長·公用局長趙曾珏及工務局長趙　康將於今日以技師資格往投票所投票，　其投票對象亦爲曾養甫。除技師團體外，其他職團選舉均將於今日中午正式截止。</p>

<p>看護小姐說笑話接生的手來選舉</p>
<p>商業團體及工會團體投票，截至昨日止，已超過半數以上。由醫師此次係與醫藥團體分開單獨舉行，且候選人祇有一人，故情况較爲平靜。會計師公會以奚王　得票最多，該處投票大致已將竣事。助產　昨集隊領取選舉　證時，多未備圖章，致全以手印代替。一小姐笑稱：「剛接生的手，又用來選舉了！」</p>

<h3>貴陽學府食鹽　舞弊風波　校長設計套購劣蹟全部敗露職員不允辭職情願大家落水</h3>
<p>〔本報貴陽十九日航訊〕國立貴陽師範學院，爲貴州全省僅有三個高等學府之一，最近發生一　套購食鹽，營私舞弊，率運學院當局之貨汚案件。自經該院敎授會曁學生自治會査覺後，即一方面組織「全體學生淸査食鹽舞弊案委員會」，一方面派還代表赴貴州　務局調閱院局兩方來往函件，經査明套購屬實後，即在筑市各報遍登緊急公告，報告澈査眞象，殊爲該院院長曾景函請各報「毋予刋登」，激越學生反感，遂轉向省參議會平議長剛，留筑監察委員何朝宗，呈遞請願文件，事態醞　甚劇，茲將該案發生經過詳情報導如次：</p>
<p>該院垷有敎職員學生工役及眷屬，連同所屬附中附小合計，不過千人。</p>
<p>學生食鹽向由院方按月備函交由每屆膳食委員會負責採購學生逕往貴州鹽務局價領，迄無問題。唯近兩月來，忽爾傳聞院方有人造册套購食鹽情事，膳食委員會每次採購食鹽，反致發生碍難，當由敎授會曁學生自治會代表暗中進行調查，毫無結果。該院學生自治會爲期早日破案，特聯合院內教育，國文，史地，英語，理化，數學，體童各學會，組織「全體學生淸査食鹽舞弊案委員會」在學院內外分別偵査，並推派代表前往貴州鹽務局査詢，據學生自治會曁各學會共同署名蓋章送往各報刋登緊急公告稱：「本會等受全體同學之托，特於本月十七日下午二時前往貴州鹽務局査詢此事，據某負責人金石泉股長談：關於此事，本局曾接貴院三十六年十一月二十日總字第七五二號來函，略謂本院員生眷屬共計三千一百五十八名，請購食鹽一千担，經張前局長德祥核閱，認爲此項請購食鹽數字，過於鉅大，乃减爲</p>
<p>二十四担已由貴院所派職員朱斌先生親自領回。言畢，復將此項有關來往函件及請領名册檢出資證，經本會各代表詳細査閱核對與金石泉股長所談各節，無一不合」。套購眞象，至此遂告大白。該院敎職員生及筑市新聞界，無不認爲此種惡劣現象，出諸貪汚之官府或惟利是圖之奸商，巳成見慣不驚，而培植中等敎育師資人扌之高等學府，竟發生此種醜惡行爲，實屬令人齒冷，各報記者經多方之調査，已得全案綫索。該院院長曾景，江西人，現年三十八歲，去年上期接任之後，以不孚衆望，曾迭次發生風潮，遂盡量任用江西同鄉，以圖驅使方便，種種劣蹟，早經學生向敎育部檢舉，並先後派有部督學來此作過專案調査此次套購食鹽，經查係由文書組組員李格，</p>
<p>化名朱斌，親携造有全院教職員生工役及眷　三千一百五十八名，請領食鹽一千担之名册，前往貴州鹽務局照官價每担四萬餘元價購，鹽務局以蓋右該院關防及院長公章，未予懷疑，僅認爲數字太大，减爲每月廿四担，每担一百市斤，十一月份市價已售至十四萬餘，即每祖可獲十萬餘元，如果請購一千担之事得諧，其所獲利益，寗不驚人！該朱斌領得食鹽之後，即將所領全部食鹽轉售與院長曾景同鄕所開設之建業商行。聞所獲利益，由李格繳送與院長之內戚文書組長左之瀛分股攤送。刻旣調査實在，眞象大白，曾院長遂採緊急措施，轉文書組左之瀛組長記</p>
<p>大過一次，並示意李格，迅即辭職他往。惟李格以本非自身一人所爲，如今旣是落水，堅特要落水大家落主張，對人表示，決不自動辭職，寗肯到法院吃官司，亦不願與人獨背罪惡。該院全體學生以新聞旣不能見刋於筑市各報，乃改登廣告，而廣告又遭院方函請各報請勿刋登，只好改向省參議會及留筑監察委員備文請願。聞將於臼內檢送各項有關證件向法院檢舉，並俟敎育部所派之督學唐惜芬來筑時，作切實之呈述，期能得公平之處理，院方日來正四處請人從中轉聞，將來是否平靜無波，當不可下。（特約記者劉孟痴）</p>

<h3>南昌屍　喉頭被扼指痕斑斑</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌十九日航訊〕本市環湖路墩子塘附近瑞園竹籬圍牆昨（十八）日發生一樁艷屍案。死者的身份是一個孤苦零仃的小婦，在她的幼年，戰時逃難到吉安，因母親病死，無依無靠，乃由王某收養，入班習唱歌曲，乃於去年六月間，得識一皮匠，趙裕祥，七月間趙以五十萬身價，娶爲已婦，但趙乃一個靠手頭謀生的工匠，家境當然不甚寬裕，何况値此米珠薪桂之季趙並好酒嗜賭，所以趙母右意願以加倍重價出賣。此一艷屍案之死者王菊英，事爲死者所聞，乃商之其義父王某，託爲籌款一百廿萬元脫身，奈以生活所困，繼入娼門，在朱萬雲家搭班爲妓，得識中央銀行一職員蕭理壁，但其前夫趙裕祥與死者斷絕關係後，每於路頭與死者遇見扭纏不淸，但又不敢重入其門，在昨日下午九時許，死者尚在書寓與其姊妹竹戰時，忽有一穿破衣者來找，死者問間胖子（指蕭理壁）在那裏，來者答云：在外面。死者遂隨而外出，澈夜未歸，年方十九的一個蕩婦，就在此深夜人靜時，被人謀殺於曠野的圍墻下，死者致命的重傷，是在喉部，指痕斑斑，似係扼塞而死，小腹　有寸許疤痕，背部全呈紫色，　屍身五六步處，有血跡二點，新屋撑柱染情形似男子染血掌印，據一般判斷，死者與兇手，　有仇隙，兇手　意用刀刺殺，因與掙扎，乃川手將其扼死，移屍於此，並將其身穿一襲皮大衣脫去，亦云慘矣。</p>
<h3>吳縣全部賦榖　征足半數以上</h3>

<h3>風雨八仙山</h3>
<p>〔本報台北十八日航訊〕拿女人來喻台灣林業，阿里山可說是「佳人選暮」，而八仙山還祇「風信年華」。阿里山砍伐了三十七年，如果不積極進行楠梓仙溪的二十年開發計劃，將僅剩兩三的壽命，八仙山雖也有了三十二年的歷史，但因爲包括大田溪左右岸及大安溪上流，北　溪上流事區城的廣裏，預定還可以繼續約二十三年，將來進而開發大小雪山蘊藏近三千五百萬石木材的大原始林，則更能延續七十年。滔滔的大田溪水曾爲日本人計劃過一個位居世界第三的達見發電所；也肥沃過這一流域的米穀成爲全台灣最優良的品種；現在它更孕育着使那位三十年來足跡遍全球的　總林　專家藍高梓（George　Naun）驚嘆爲世界首屈一指的大森林，這次他曾與林產管理局長唐振緒等，巡視了全省阿里山，八仙山，太平山三個林塲，記者一路上聽到他們不少寳貴意見。</p>
<p>紐約旅館華麗屏風</p>
<p>台灣有世界上最高貴的材木，但藍高梓說，在台灣却被糟塌了，紐約最華麗旅館裏的屛風，在這裏却做了枕木，鋼琴，梵　林以至Row　Boat上的長槳的原料，到處發現在這裏的門窗上，甚至木欄干上，四塊美金一尺的木材，這裏這樣暴殄，他奇怪為什麼不拿到他的國家去—澳洲，只要少數針葉樹，可以換到他們大量的硬枕木，基於此，他感到整個台灣的林木不合理利用，等於沒有砍伐，省政府的禁止木材出口，在他看是一個量大的失策。他希望有一個五年計劃，有一個專爲台灣林業而訂定的「林業法」，用五年的埋頭經營，可增益十倍以上的收入，一面每年提出十分之六的迭林金與採伐相配合，靠每年預算來迭林，永不會成功的，林管局本年預算二十四億元的造林金，只批准了八億。他有十分信心，只要兩個字—Good　Selling</p>
<p>鋼索懸車直昇巓峯</p>
<p>八仙山有兩種值得一看的建設，一是斜面鐵道（Incline）長達一千八百餘公尺，是遠東第一斜軌，分成三段，各以三十度左右的斜度，上昇千一百多公尺，用電力曳引鋼索運材，使用了二十四年，一切多破舊了，因爲曲綫多，運材較難，一天平均僅八五立方公尺。在目前說，這已經是落伍的工具了其次就是索道，我們從佳保合車站出發，八個人裝了一箱，藉着山上放下的巨材力量，縣索上昇，直達巓峯，情緒上是飄飄欲仙，然而俯目下望，離地有一千多公尺，萬一鋼索一斷，這後果眞不堪設想。用了十三年的鋼索，到處有從新啣接的痕跡。每一個林塲多在　請器材的補充。在狂風暴雨襲，我們從索道的終點新八仙山，再乘木炭車冒了絕大危險更上一層去看集材機，永遠生活在這二千多尺高山的林塲工人，穿著沒有一塊好布的短衫褲，然而還是賣力。這些人在風雨裏，器材也在風雨裏，整個台灣的林業又何嘗不在風雨　？</p>
<p>一比一的陡險山坡</p>
<p>高梓　報告　說，願意提供台　的森業　為聯總齣事業之一，他詳密調査器材的匱乏情形，更注意到全省鋸木工廠的數量。他具體指出，今後台灣可以儘量建設木材加工工廠包括三夾板，工具把柄，高等傢具，和木材蒸　成品等等，多足以供應世界市塲，增裕整個的台灣甚至中國的經濟。　登了阿里山與八仙山以後，他提出湖北，福建和西部　國，應當派人到這裏來學習，訓練將來整例中國林業開　　　幹，我問他爲什麽特別指出鄂，閩兩省，他笑着說，這裏多曾組織過公司，請求到很多器材，結果却不懂開發技術。在台灣學習，有兩點方便：一，工程完全，從砍伐，集材，運輸全部完整，二，山坡陡險，在澳洲山坡大多爲高與底一比四構成的斜面，而台灣是一比一，能克服這種困難，就能克服任何困難，他不住讚佩那些工人熟練的技術。唐局長說，藍高梓的看法有其獨到之處，這種意見不妨攤向每一個關心台灣林業的人們。（記者楊文育）</p>

<h3>流亡靑年在淮陰　集中職訓班受訓</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿一日訊」「靑年輔導」爲了配合動員戡亂國策前進的方向，緊跟着建國洪流奔向了綏靖區，展開集救靑年的搶救工作，蘇北綏靖區成千成萬的靑年，雖然已一批批的渡江南來，各自找到了安身之所取得了溫暖，可是，陷在泥汚深坑的匪區裏，還有好多靑年，在渴望救濟輔導，而淮陰是蘇北的重鎭，扼運兩淮地當蘇皖要隘，溝通江南北的樞紐，准陰淮安漣水泗陽　城阜寗述陽灌雲的靑年，大都集散在此，對那裏的靑年，又怎能漢視，因此，敎育部江蘇靑年輔導處，正視當前的現實情况，順應地方的請求，在上年四月便決定設置一個輔導機構，准陰職業訓練班，收容淮陰一帶的脫險靑年，予以物質的救濟，給以職業的訓練，蘇活其精神上的疲勞，這是淮陰職業訓練班誕生的由來及其歷史的根源，淮陰職業訓練班的成長，雖然祗有短短八九個月的時間，但已辦了兩次登記，收容了近千的靑年，第一期收訓靑年爲四八二人，現都紛紛就業，有的服務敎育，肩起文化担子，有的作行政基幹，在推行地方自治有的辦理合作，分担經濟建設的責任，這樣的因材輔導，對社會，對國家，對靑年，實已盡了部份的責任，多少作了些貢獻，可是經辦的人們，他們認爲距離理想尚遠，還不以此自滿，故今後應該怎樣努力，作進一步的打算，正是他們引爲最重要的課題，第二次登記的靑年，剛剛辦理完竣，計劃正按着預定的程序在實施訓練中，這一次收容　人數，共三百多人，我們從被收容靑年的談片中，知道過去他們徬徨失望的身心，已得了無限的慰藉！</p>
<p>總之，淮陰職訓班是在成長中，雖然有多種困難，使他們的搶救輔導工作，不能如理想的盡量展開，可是在那裘工作的人，確已盡了最大的努力我們可以看到放在眼前的成果，我們可以看到他們一直邁進的方向。（本報記者和香林）</p>
<h3>老婦第六胎　產下猴形怪嬰</h3>
<p>〔本報海南島十六日航訊〕海口市彰興街李奇芳醫務所，十四日下午二時，有秀英鄉水頭村陳某之婦陳周氏留產，突生一女怪胎，頗肖猴形，頭大顎小，鼻及上唇均缺，喉嚨直通頭頂，頭部毛黑長如茸，無蓋骨，右耳大，左耳小，手足與常嬰無異，身體頗壯。據李醫師稱：該胎　母體時，頻頻動彈，惟默不作聲，直至入夜八時，該小生命始告氣絕。現其母則安全無恙。該所認爲此胎有研究價値，時以福美林藥水藏於玻璃瓶內。市民開訊，紛紛前往觀看，自晨至夜，絡繹不絕，並紛紛議論，以該產婦現年已五十三歲，已超過生育年齡，一般婦女，超過四十九歲，其「天癸」已絕，大半停止生育，而該婦以五十三歲之高齡，竟產一怪嬰，誠屬怪事。據記者調查該婦前後，共生男女六胎，產後或三四月，或二三歲，即告夭折，現迄無一長成者。此胎為第六胎，已孕至十一足月之久，怪孕期間，生活正常。十四日上午十一時許，其夫偕同到該所留產，醫生檢査時，發現該胎臀部先露，非正常生產，乃請其夫簽字，遂施用手術取出。</p>

<h3>南民主第一課　選舉教育運動大展開</h3>
<p>〔本報周浦廿二日訊〕二十一日起，南匯民衆開始接受民主的第一課，事先，因為有南匯縣選舉教育運動促進會的宣傳，所以民衆們對於這件事也慢慢感覺到興趣，至少已經提起他們的注意。沒有拿到選舉權證的，知道向保甲長去催索，已經拿到選舉權證的都在　備着一顯身手，來試用一下這從未眞正使用過的權力了。</p>
<p>當然，這究竟是第一課，不能每一件事情都如我們的理想。同時，各鄉保之問，由於主持者努力程度的不同，也不免有相異的結果，記者願意以第一天目擊情形，略作報告：</p>
<p>投票所　每保一所　爲了應付普遍投票的需要，南匯縣選舉事務所呈准省方增設投票所。標準是每保一所，全縣共計四百九十九所，周浦鎭計有二十一保，所以也有二十一個投票所。上午九時，各投票所的管理員和監察員都紛紛到齊，開始投票。選民也流水一樣的不斷湧進去，成績都很美滿。整個的南匯縣，只有少數的幾保，或是保長懈怠，手續還沒辦齊，或是保長爲私事牽制，不能如期開始選舉，但這是極少數的現象，一般情形却都非常良好。</p>
<p>王艮仲　選舉狄膺　王艮仲是南匯各界所擁戴的候選選舉狄膺人，也是這一次選舉敎育運動的發動者，這一次，他差不多不注意自己得票和當選的問題，一心一意的用全力來推動選舉敎育運動。二十一日晨九時，他以選民的身份，親自到周浦鎭第五保去投票，他投的是狄膺的票。</p>
<p>至於其他的選民，投票絕對自由，選舉的對象也相常普遍。不過據一般的估計，王艮仲得票佔絕對多數。</p>
<p>宣傳車　巡廻出發</p>
<p>投票開始以後，選舉敎育宣傳工作更積極進行。選敎促進會的宣傳列車，昨天出發到遠北，北蔡，張江，古鶴諸鄕。屬浦小組的化裝宣傳隊，昨天到杜行，　匯，今天繼續到宣橋鄕去。另外，大江中學的宣傳隊也出動到周浦一帶來。他們無論任何一隊，任何一個隊員，都興高采烈的參加工作。因爲他們知道：他們不是爲任何一個人在作競選活動，他們是在推動民主敎育，是最實際最合時的社會敎育。</p>
<p>到二十一日晚問爲止，各地投票的情形平均在六成以上，其中魯匯鄕的第一，第九，第十各保，六灶鄕的第一保全部投票完畢。新塲鎭第八保，坦直鄉第十保也都達到百分之九十八。再有二天的努力，成績一定可觀。所以選舉敎育運動促進會的幾位先生鬆了一口氣說：「這一次選敎運動，總算不失敗，我們的努力，總算有了收穫了」！</p>

<h3>同濟學潮僵持</h3>
<p>丁校長希望學生明日復課　傳朱家驊將由台返滬調解</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕同濟大學學生抗議校方任意開除同學，罷課迄已一週。雙方意見僵持，愈見尖銳。被開除之學生，在滬多無觀屬，均住校中，刻與在校學生仍保持密切接觸。學生方面爲集中力量，討論對付校方處置問題，文醫兩學院學生，昨日移入該校其美路工學院內食宿，新生院及法學院學生亦定今明兩日相繼遷入工學院內，以示堅持到底之決心。校方自丁文淵校長以下各部門負責人，日內均不在校內辦公，各院系敎授雖欲到校上課，而敎室內靜寂無人，部份願意上課者，亦因情緒不定，相率聞去。據丁校長昨晚在電話中告稱：希望學生於明日全部復課，否則，第四批開除學生名單，即予公佈。並定今日下午三時召開行政會議，提出討論。丁氏不否認該校罷課問題日內難護圓滿解決，蓋渠認爲執行國家敎育政策，雜持學校行政尊嚴，對於學生堅持非法要求，決不讓步。記者昨日會訪該校敎授多人，渠等均以「說話難」，拒絕發表意見，亦不願出面調解，僅希望由同濟校友出面調解，較爲適當。</p>
<p>〔又訊」該校昨日盛傳，同濟得力校友唐哲等多人正進行調解，並傳已電請朱家驊部長由台飛滬，以該校校友資格，參加調解。又：同濟復員靑年軍聯誼會，昨派代表數人，以第三者立塲謁見丁校長，請求變相承認新選出之自治會，以打破此久持之僵局，而便早臼復課。丁校長未允所請，矚勸同學復課後，可按照部頒新自治會會章，籌備自治會。</p>

<h3>三等分任何一角　仍為難題</h3>
<p>根據歐氏幾何作圖的公設</p>
<p>本報讀者蕭成基。孔繁淸二君來函，批評西安一讀者對「三等分任何一角，並非難題」一點，認爲未合。茲將　函照誌如次：</p>
<p>茲見十三日貴報載有西安一讀者所述以直尺三等分任意角之法，中云：「以直尺通過B點，在此角內移動作BE錢，交DG綫於F及交DP錢於E，使EF爲BD之兩倍長。」按此種作法，實已違背歐氏幾何作岡之公設（Postulate），蓋所謂初等幾何之學作圖，除限用圓規及直尺外，對此二器之用法，歐氏幾何原本中亦右規定：　過二點可引一直綫。　以定點爲中心，定長爲半徑，可作一圓。三等分一角之所以不可能，蓋即由於此種限制。今觀上法，其直尺之應用，業已踰越歐氏之公設，故不能視爲正當之作法。至於對此問題，鄙人完全贊同長大敎務長張德馨博士之意見，其理論根據亦早爲數學界所公認。申報讀者簫成基</p>
<p>「頃閱十三日貴報載西安一讀者投函申述：「三等分任何一角並非難題」，且舉有只用直尺之分法，但其忽視了歐氏幾何所限制的條件——一支圓規與一支無刻度的直尺（三角板都不能用），在歐氏幾何作圖的限制下，繪一平行錢（或垂綫），都要用到圓規，而此讀者在北洋大學所得之只用直尺法，不知怎樣作出垂錢DG，與平行綫DE？但此法的BE綫，始終無法用圓規與萬尺作成，故此法不能爲一己成立的解法。最近傳聞一時的楊君作法，尚不失爲一近似法，然也不是歐氏幾何之目的，不過楊君尚知先聲明「沒有學過高等數學」，也就是楊君還知其所學不足（楊君之法，並不需要高等數學就可證明其錯誤，此點我們暫不細談）。而此讀者引用什麼「北洋大學×××敎授言……。」等語，以爲舉證，直有些使人啼笑皆非。這是本人的愚見，尚希登載，以正視聽。申報讀者孔繁淸。」</p>
<p>〔中央社廣漢通訊〕交通部公路局第五區公路工程管理局工務第八總段第三十工務段工程司袁成林，前見報載「長大敎務長張德馨博士對楊嘉如發明「三等分任何一角」，認爲不可能，表示懷疑，因該問題及「作一圓相等於正方形」或「作一正方形相等於一圓」，曾在諾貝爾獎金學會提出，可見爲必可解之事，唯至今尚無人獲致正確解答，袁君深感興趣，經研究後，對「三等分任何一角」，「作一圓相等於一正方形」，「作一正方形相等於一圓」三題，均得一解答，方法簡單，證明不誤。現已由袁君分函全國敎學專家討論，且將解答方法列式，以供全國人士之研究，任何人均可照其方法作圖，函索可寄廣漢南京路九十七號云。　〔附告〕頃承本報讀者紛紛來函討論一三等分任何一角」問題，佩感交深，惟限於篇幅，未克逐一披露，諸希原宥。編者</p>

<p>晨友勝美空軍</p>
<p>第二幕甲一組，晨友對美空軍，裁判鄭志芳吳效堤，晨友由王蓉生何增傳其俠史久全季有崑臨陣，雙方旗鼓相當，迭有建樹，屢造各五各七各九平手，空軍嗣後二度領先，十七對十九時，晨友王炳福入塲，調出史久全，小王上塲，即大施猛射，獲分甚多，晨友始告超出，上半時終了，晨友三十一，美空軍廿一。再鬥聲中，拉奎斯脫先中，晨友炳福榮生與何增，三元及第，頓添六分，空軍李蒙五次犯規畢業，培干入替，三十五比四十四時，空軍再呼停，密議對策，但晨友緊迫不捨，難以得逞，不久時間完畢，晨友以五十八比三十七挫美</p>

<h3>浮多紛紛了結　棉紗行情續挫　布疋實銷不動人心虛怯</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨初開盤平庸，後聞各地物價下游，客帮絕少活動，織廠稍意亦懈，同業受銀根抽緊之壓迫，斬殺仍夥，浮多紛紛了結，市上出多進少，行情再見下瀉。四十二支藍鳳細紗曾小至五千六百二十萬，收時浮空獲利抵補，回上至五千六百五十萬元，卒比上日再挫卅萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，亦均步降二·三十萬至五。六十萬不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况初開交易閑散，喊價平穩，本街實銷不動，各商號均在準備總結束，銀根軋緊，同業了結甚多，漢口帮亦有吐出。同時更傳震盛布號以折款關係　頭寸短絀，週轉不靈，市塲人心更形虛怯，買戶觀望，價乃不振。迨至最後，十二磅各細布價微回秀，跳鯉漂布軌升萬五千元，其餘嗶嘰直貢及色布等，則見下降。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司照例開布，掛牌五福B字細布便爲一百十九萬五千元，玩傘漂布一百八十四萬元，四君子印花嗶嘰一百四十七萬，印花色丁一百廿七萬元，申購者甚稀。　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共售四〇三〇疋，被單八〇條，申購單八五張，內除廠商三張，購布六百疋外，餘悉屬布號所購。</p>
<h3>外銷紗布　調整價格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司辦理紗布外銷頗著成績。最近紗布外銷價格，略有調整。茲探誌該公同外銷紗布之上海碼頭交貨價格棉紗：廿支藍鳳三百美元，或一百英鎊。廿支立馬二九〇美元，或九八英鎊。卅二支三三〇美元，或一一八英鎊。四十支四百美元，或一三〇英鎊。六十支六二〇美元，或二〇六英鎊。八十支八百美元，或二六五英鎊。</p>

<h3>人造絲平穏　綢貨步步挫跌</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市平穩，因黑市行情已降至配售價相仿，人心較堅，結果與上日軋平。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤六百五十萬元，有二箱成交。中午收盤，復升至七百五十萬元即期價，午後隔日期，曾喊至九百萬元賣出價，最後行情，又降爲七百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經　昨日賣戶充斥，行情一致挫降，各級五担頭仍乏成交，喊價比上日短一百萬元之譜，高級零担，成交價爲九千萬元，中級零担較次者，亦有二担交易，價做八千五百萬元。干經普通零担，降至七千五百萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨　昨市續挫，華強眞絲被面，上午開市在九百六十萬元左右，旋因供求失衡，步步下降，收市即期做九百萬元，隔日期爲四十萬元，其他綢貨，均徘徊在疲途之中。　呢絨穩固　毛織品呢羢，昨棋盤街及長樂茶會上趨勢，依然穩固，標準行情始終堅易。大衣呢類則多下降，夾色花呢遠較染色花呢爲佔優勢，因染色花呢小廠家出品頗多。銷路方面，本客帮均見呆鈍，蓋其實銷相繼落令，連日上漲至高峯，吃本加重，拆息有關也。</p>
<h3>食米銷路仍呆　油市依然平疲</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧八千九百餘石，店方門銷淸懈，市塲銷路仍呆，依然供過於求，形勢節節下游。粳稻米續見挫跌三四萬元，白陰元步削一二萬元。麵粉內地轉堅，零銷右動，回升三五千元。麩皮實銷不動，苦無問津，繼續猛跌萬元。</p>
<p>豆餅初開平平，午時汕頭吸胃突然轉濃，臨收疾升，挺漲萬元，杜黃則零化清淡，疲而不醒。東北大豆汕頭搜購，形勢俏利，，未許樂觀。赤豆交易稀少，續削萬元，蠶豆消化轉呆，挫落二三萬元。豇豆買賣兩少，價形平　紅糧交淡少神，續小萬元，苞米北洋納胃不爽，疲由徘徊。芝蔴成交亦稀，高定次疲。生仁廣帮本街互有進取，市勢活絡，盤漲二三萬元。</p>
<p>油市仍趨平疲之格，豆油略挫萬元，菜油亦低萬元。生油則到湧銷細，猛跌六七萬元，惟蔴油到銷兩敵，依然站立，配油即日開始。</p>
<h3>台糖公司　開售四期配糖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台糖公司昨循例開售本年第四期配糖，計共開出特號砂白約三一〇〇噸，配價以台幣比率，甫於廿一日起調整爲一對九六，故各擋食糖，每市担均普加三萬元，冰糖加五萬元。昨日配出之特砂，每市担爲一五〇萬元。</p>
<p>又該公司本年第二三兩期配糖額，爲調劑廢曆年關供需計，特照平時加配百分之五十。本期以供需已趨正常，故恢復照平常配量開售。</p>
<p>昨台糖第四期照常配售，僅供給特砂一種，價格加起三萬元，而配額减照三十七期原數。公會劃盤，趨勢平疲，現貨二四粗白爲一百七十二萬元至七十萬元，小二三萬元。二〇中砂白一百六十五萬元，期貸棧單無甚軒輊。</p>
<p>土糖情勢更弱，有供過於求之概。汕提靑開一百四十五萬元至四十三萬元，小二三萬元。棉赤一百五十二萬元，興化白袋裝高貨一百七十三萬元，興赤一百五十七萬元至五十四五萬元。刁靑一百四十五萬元至三十九萬元，小四五萬元。</p>
<p>茶市活躍</p>
<p>內銷茶仍在本街　客帮去化絡織中，過程活躍異常。他若外銷花色，出口商之胃納依然呆頓，情勢遂猶沉寂，惟查趨勢，則各再帶堅，揆以市上存底，迄未遞增，故執主態度一意扳售，市面乃得能緊站。價格方面，賡續稱秀，脚地亦無搖動可危之象。</p>
<h3>捲烟肥皂續疲</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，　開平穩，旋以華成派貨，價續下游。午收時聞頤中烟廠盤再度調整，「老刀哈德門」每　加一百萬元，人心轉堅，行情回俏。午後因間業頭寸軋緊，止進轉吐，故結果十支大英老刀兩烟再見下挫廿五萬至十五萬元，此外惟紅人三貓兩牌，以去化較活，獨好一·二千元，其餘中外各烟及聽裝烟依然軋降。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市况交易閑散，固本皂小至一百七　萬元，稱有成交，比上日軋跌三萬五千元。午後以銀根關係，了吐者多，箭刀祥茂光華等皂亦均下游萬餘元至三萬元。火柴美麗鳳凰二牌軋小十五萬元，雜牌回上四五萬，火油做開不多，市氣帶虛，回小二萬，美孚每聽做價七十八萬元。</p>
<h3>新買不感興趣　華股沉淪疲境</h3>
<p>華股昨恍惚不定，中途之買風爲時至暫，人心雖存慾望，但新買興趣毫無，漲風一　即逝，終　度境。</p>
<p>晨開永紗以六九〇元及七三五元之價登塲，步降至六七八元及七一七元低價。塲外息價略低，爲三角及三角四分半，升至六九四元及七三二元，雖有趁高了結，但大戶進意仍股，近午漲到七〇四元及七四二元高價。午收爲六九九元及七三四元，較前收計即交股華新跌一成，華豐中泥五和中法跌半成，閘北榮鹽大通永公內衣均平，餘者升降俱微。遞交股美亞升半成，除均微漲。</p>
<p>午後上塲聲勢甚盛，惜爲時至暫，自七〇七元及七三五元起，直售至六七三元及七〇〇元低價。國行交換差出，人心一振，曾兩度回好到六九〇元及七二〇元外，掙扎之下，以六八五元及七一八元之價收市。結果較晨收計即交股美亞華豐永公跌半成，餘股升降俱微。遞交股華豐景福美亞勤興跌半成，餘咸微降。場外各未上市股票，榮辱俱見。</p>
<p>現遞套利交易，昨甚平穩。永紗貼價開盤三七元，自三九元退至三六元，而以三七元半收市。信和自二〇元降至一七元，收市一八元。美亞自五五元升至六〇元結束，新光介乎五元內外，貼進者可獲息二角至二角半。</p>
<h3>統債外股平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨平穩之局，統丙晨開七萬七，低價曾見六萬七，而後回升至七萬三結果。成交約四百萬。較前收計甲乙尚平，丙了戊各升一千元。</p>
<p>外股昨中途亦有回升，但終難持久，不脫平幫局面。廣帮有貨，洋行帮及證券帮先進後出，怡紗晨開五四萬，自五三萬回漲至五六萬外，而後轉平。午後更乏建樹，結果較前收計怡紗英聯微升，會德豐怡啤墾植平平，紙版航業各跌半成，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>山羊皮包裝材料　輸管會准先進口</h3>
<p>出口包裝材料進口辦法，自政院核定後，輸管會即遵照舉辦登記。本市業經登記竣事，外埠各區，亦巳陸續報來。截至目前爲止，該會已收到三百三十一件，計本市一九七件，靑島廿四件，天津一〇四件，重慶三件，漢口三件，僅台灣·廣州·瀋陽三區辦事處，尚未彙送。該會輸出推廣處，巳就季節性之需要者，先行審核。以實際情形而論，山羊皮需要之包裝材料如鐵皮，　腦等，最爲迫切，故己着手審核。山羊皮每一百萬張，需樟腦三十噸，需鐵皮十五噸，樟腦，國外價格每噸値八十英鎊至八十五英鎊，鐵皮每一百磅値六元金。此項外匯頭寸，該會已函請中央銀行准備撥付。據出口業權威表示：本年可輸出山羊皮六百萬張，每張平均價爲美金一元，可換同外匯六百萬美金，惟目前交通不暢，恐難如理想。</p>

<h3>凍結投機票　金管決不放鬆</h3>
<p>關於銀行本票被凍結事，市銀行公會，昨曾具文金管局要求解凍。理由係銀行未經宣告清理，本票不應予以凍結處分。但據金管局某負責人稱：按照當局管制金融業務辦法第九條規定，如發現有助長投機囤積之情事時，得為緊急之措施，勸令停業清理，取將其經理人移送法院懲辦。又根據財部卅六年七月十七日財錢庚二字第二九九八三號代電，即關於票據未兌收前，即准抵現支用情事，非僅足以擴張信用，抑且足使行莊自身頭寸匡計難周，弊端滋大，風險堪虛，曾經財部分別糾正有案。茲查此種情事，目前仍屬盛行，該局爲執行政府法令，於撿査時，凡屬有涉經營金鈔罪嫌及發現有投機行爲者，不論本票支票，除依法嚴辦外，一律先予凍結處分，決不稍予寬貸。</p>
<h3>去年十一月進出口貿易　逆差已較前好轉　出口增進口減為以前稀有之事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據海關總稅務司署發表去年十一月份我國進出口貿易統計，進出口逆差已較前好轉，出口更較十月份激增約達三倍之鉅，進口亦較十月份爲减少，實爲去年十一月份前僅見之跡象，茲探誌各項數字如次：</p>
<p>十一月份進口淨値爲一，六七八，七七〇，三九七，〇〇〇元，出口凈値爲一，五六〇，五二四，〇八二，〇〇〇元，入超總額爲一一八，二四六，三一五，〇〇〇元。與十月份相較十月份之進口淨値爲一，七四六，七六六，二七八，〇〇〇元，十一月份進口淨値計减少六七，九九五，八八一，〇〇〇元。十月份之出口淨値爲五三〇，〇四〇，四二九，〇〇〇元，十一月份出口淨値計激增一，〇三〇，四八三，六五三，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>激增之出口貨中以疋頭佔首，計共四〇九一億元。其他爲猪鬃及動物產品，計共二六一九億元。桐油脂臘二一八五億元。五金一礦砂一四一九億元。大豆花生等一六三八億元。榖物二四七億元。茶葉四八六億元。</p>
<p>十一月份我國主要之出口國家」，仍以美國佔首，計向我輸入四八〇〇億元，香港三三五〇億元，印度九九七億元。我國主要之進口國家，亦以美國佔首，計對我輸入七八六四億元。印度二二九〇億元。英國一二三四億元。</p>
<h3>中信局擬恢復　以鹽對日易貨</h3>
<p>中央信託局自去年度停止以鹽對日易貨後，對日易貨工作，迄今仍無法展開。日本運來我國之易貨物資，全係採用記帳方式，目前我國尚未確定以其他物資抵償日貨。但我國食鹽之產量，確有剩餘，我國本身尚無法盡量運用。故現該局向鹽政總局及其他有關機關商洽，計劃於最近恢復以鹽對日易貨。一方面易換我國所需之原料，一方面償還去年度之欠價云。</p>
<h3>業中人士分析　華茶外銷困難</h3>
<p>關於最近華茶外銷情形及其內在困難，前途展望各點，茲據茶葉界有資格人士分析，其概况如次。國際市塲，仍以美國爲主要對象。我政府爲鼓勵外銷，自外匯新辦法公佈實施後，斟酌實際情形，採取機動式之調整價格，在出口商固可稍獲裨益，但在美方承銷者，感覺外匯不能穩定，爲防止虧耗計，不敢貿然大批採購，改為零星成交，即賣出多少，補進若干，致躉批銷路，常陷呆滯。法國貿易不以美元爲單位，須先以法郎折合金鎊或美鈔計算，其輸出入管制，亦如我國之嚴格，且其出口貨中，幷非盡能獲得我國之進口允許，再如法之可能輸入貨物中，更非全為華茶，是以零碎銷路减少。其錄茶大宗成交方法，已另闢有新途徑。去年運出貨品，均由法國經使節團委託駐滬法商永興洋行統籌辦理。去年度運往法國者，已有數起，最後一批，約爲三萬餘箱，每箱約重六十市斤，總計約一萬八千擔。其每市擔之扯價，計屯綠二四〇萬元至二八〇萬元，平綠一七〇萬元至一八〇萬元，內中以永興佔最多數。餘如華茶公司汪裕泰午昌等，均有託代運往者。戰前英國紅茶銷路甚佳，戰後英國節約風氣全國一致，對高級華茶不願嘗　，寗可降低而求諸粗劣者。蘇聯茶磚銷路，過去亦旺，以易貨手續未了，暫時無從推銷，然將來仍爲理想市塲。</p>
<p>至茶葉內在困難原因　前途展望两點，該方面人士認爲茶葉咸以食米計算，規定每三担米折合茶葉一担，內由茶葉成本，合米一担半，其餘包括加工·運輸·包裝　費。回憶前　度茶葉價每担卅萬元，　集十億元資金，可購茶三千餘担。去年茶價則升至每担一五〇萬元，原右資金，僅可購茶六百六十餘担，依照現時米價，又僅二百餘担可購。假使靑黃不接，米價再起渡動時，其比量更减。基此原因，茶商脅於資金數字之龐大，其利潤亦屬渺茫。茶葉前途籠罩不景氣氛圍，此乃危機之績結所在。欲求改善，祇有籲請政府協助。其原則第一，為委託茶商「代製」，予以合法利潤，以提高品質，减低成本，推廣輸出，爭取外匯。第二爲「收購」，由政府速舉辦大量貸款，由茶商製迭成品後，按照實際成本收購，其差額由政府津貼，以鼓勵外銷。</p>
<h3>推廣絲織品外銷</h3>
<p>中蠶託新光織絹絲襯衫</p>
<p>中蠶公司爲謀推廣絲織品外銷計，特將該公司所產之絹絲，織成合於外銷內衣用之絹絲綢。並與新光內衣公司合作，託將上項絹絲綢，製成襯衫內衣等，推銷歐美及南洋各地。聞國外同等品質之襯衫，運至國內，每件售價，約合國幣一百四十萬元。上項絹絲綢織製之襯衫，每件僅合國幣七十萬元。現已製成各色樣品襯衫十餘種，色澤鮮艷，價廉物美，外銷前途，定可樂觀。同時並供國內人士需要，藉以减少外貨之輸入，旣輕用戶負担，又减外匯漏巵云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中國蠶絲公司統計去年蠶絲外銷美國佔二，一五〇包，印度一，二四〇包，緬甸一，六〇〇包，英國一，一六五包，安南四〇包，法國七三包，蘇聯六〇〇包。前正欲運出者，計美國八〇〇包，緬甸一，三〇〇包，其運銷方式，美國爲寄售，蘇聯易貨，其餘均簽訂合約，直接交易。外銷價每磅三元，美國寄售，照市塲價格決定，但美國市價現跌至二元六角，各國均蒙受影響。至加工絲織品，如織成睡衣晚服等，每磅可値四元至五元，此生絲獲利為多。又據絲織業公會方面稱，去年五月至年底，僅印度一地，即銷售我絲織品九萬九千疋，雖受印度內亂影響，而銷路仍無問題。去年運印之絲議品，可換外匯五百萬美金，政府若能盡量協助出口，僅印度一地，每年即可換取外匯一千萬美金云。</p>
<h3>外貨紗管進口　班院核准限制</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕爲保護我國幼稚工業，外貨紗管之進口，已由政院核准限制。至日貨紗管，則於對日貿易開放後禁止進口。此事係應紗管業同業公會之請，由全經會分函輸管會限制進口，並請經濟部轉飭中央工業試驗所督促改進國產紗管之改進。</p>

<h3>醫匠</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>我們如不健忘，總該還記得「假鳳虛風」的糾紛三十六年上海十大新聞之一—，「乖乖弄的東」，「那塊」同鄕爲了一「匠」之爭，脈憤筋張，摩拳擦掌。小子雖然無知，何至菲薄如此，甘冒不韙，好好的四平八穩的字眼不用，難道不怕自討沒趣嗎？可是，別忙——</p>
<p>原來這「醫匠」兩個字，並非筆者信口胡謅；漢刺史游做的急就篇裏有一句：「篤　衰廢迎醫匠」，是「醫匠」二字，古人已先我用之。假如用字不當有罪，則罪在史游。</p>
<p>「匠」，凡工役皆稱之，所以銅匠，鐵匠，木匠，泥水匠，……（恕我唐突）等等，不一而足。勞動最是神聖，做一個「匠」，並沒有什麼微賤之處。上海由「匠」起家的，不乏其人，只有書生，才是百無一用。「匠」又作計劃制作解，名園記：「皆出其目營心匠」，計劃制作，常要大傷腦筋，是爲勞心；好了，勞力勞心，集於一「匠」，「匠」，又是何等崇高—</p>
<p>善哉史游！——「篤　衰廢」，是說人困頓於沉疴之中；人生起病來，本來和一架行動的機器一時「拋錨」一樣，機器出了毛病，只有請工匠來修理，把醫生看做一個修理血肉機器的工匠，去迎接他來，繩之古義，準諸今理，均無不合。史游用字，眞是：巧妙當恰，無以復加，我輩臨床醫人，捫心自問，對於生病的人體，是不是勉盡修理之責？自然，一副機器壞透，大家都沒法修理；可是，敢說大家都曾爲之「鞠躬盡瘁」過了。惟有「醫匠」兩個字，才能表示我輩職業的性能，及高尚的品格。所以我有別於一些人的見解，並不憎惡這個「匠」字，反而覺得牠雋雅可愛。許多不順眼的事物，理路弄淸楚之後，可能心靜氣平，情緒不至緊張。「愚拙生亂氣，皆因理不通」，回想「假鳳虛凰」的風波，不無此感，大乖心理衛生之道，藉「醫匠」說，以示其凡。</p>
<h3>醫術與智力之改造</h3>
<p>— 瞿滇宏</p>
<p>原子時代的醫學，畢竟也趨向原子化了。雖然，進展的階段，還不能使你隨心所欲的買到一瓶一智慧丸」用來改進你的工作能力和理解力，可是別急呀！這個可能性不再是一個空虛的幻想了。</p>
<p>在過去，醫學對於一個思想遲鈍的孩子，簡直是束手無策，科學的進展只能使我們用種種的方法證明某一個人的智力不够水準，至於如何去改進他齣智力，那可就要等待未來的發明了。幸遝得很，世界上還有着一羣醫學界的先驅者，他們不惜工本的埋頭苦幹，結果他們用一種物質呌Glutamic給一個智力不能與臼俱進的孩子服用，六個月後，竟獲得一個驚人的結論——孩子的智力在這幾個月內竟以超越的速度突然猛進！</p>
<p>Glutamic　Acid究竟有點什麽秘密呢？這個，即使是發明Gutamic　Acid的醫師們也不能給你一個確切詳細的回答。可是他們却知道這東西與具有高効能的化學物品Acetylcholine有著密切的連繋。根據科學家　研究試騐，我們已經相信Acetylcholin。能够促進神經系統內信息與命令的傳導。換句話說，Acetylcholine的存在，是神經系統維持常態的要素。由於以上兩點信心，我們就不難推測Glutamic　Acid的服用，可以直接增進Acetyicholine的產量，問接促進神經系統的活動力。</p>
<p>讓我們來想像我們的腦子，是個成千累萬不可勝數的種經細胞錯綜夾雜的結晶，假使你的腦子是正常的話，那麼細胞的數目不管多到如何的驚人，牠們彼此之間，必定有著密切的聯繫。科學家還不能澈底的解釋牠們是用什麼方法來取得這個奧妙的聯繫，他們只能推測這或許是由於電波的與化學的作用。假使你能想出一個方法來加强神經系統的衝動，那麼你就可以改進你的智力了。現在我們要試用的方法就是利用GlutamicAcid來增加Acetylcholine產量。</p>
<p>Glutamic　Acid已經發明很久了，只是近十年來人們才察覺到牠蘊藏着的力量。哥倫比亞大學神經學院裏的著名敎授Frederick　Zimmerman和他的朋友Sharmann　Ross曾經用老鼠做過考騐。他們定做了一只迷園似的大箱，在箱的盡頭，放置着食物；然後把事前選擇好的一羣正常的健壯的老鼠關進去。（其中半數喂了一日量的Glutamic　Acid）.結果一半老鼠就像熱鍋裏的螞蟻，東衝西撞的瞎抓瞎跑，另一半吃過Glutamic　Acid的一羣，却不同了。牠們很快的跑出了迷宮，到達了箱子的盡頭。後來K.E.Alder和C.J.Warden也用老鼠做過相似的試騐；他們定製了一只木箱，箱子裏橫擺着四塊木板，在箱的盡頭放着食物；老鼠要吃到這食物就必須越過那四塊木板。根據記錄老鼠能毫無困難的越過兩塊木板；倘使發點時間費點氣力的話，可以越過三塊木板，可是無論牠餓到怎樣的程度，三塊木板是最高的極限了。後來他們喂給牠吃Glutamic　Acid，結果Glutamic　Acid發生了驚人的力量。老鼠終終越過了四塊木板而獲得了食物。由於這Glutamic　Acid的試驗，使我們連想到一個疑問——Glutamic　Acil對於老鼠能如此，那麽對於人類呢？旣想到這個疑問，就曾有人埋頭硏究。結果三位醫學研究家J.C.Pricej　H.Wcalch和Tracy　Puteam發現Glutamic　Acid可以醫治小發作的顛癇，牠能减少發作的次數和患者齣痛苦。舉個例來說吧，一個二十五歲的靑年，在童年時腦子受了傷，患上了Petitmal　Epileptic。結果每天十二Gm的Gfutamic　Acid不但停止了顛癇的發作，並且一變以前的呆滯。七個月後停止服用Glutamic　Acid，就在停止服用的期間，他又回復了以前，病態。再舉個例，一個發育渦晚的孩子，實足兩歲了，旣不會說話，又不會走路；別說說話和走路了，連玩耍的勁兒都沒有。Dr.Zimmerman也試用Glutamic　Acid,一個月後，孩子竟興高采烈的塔起積木來了。後來因爲食慾受到了影響Glutamic　Acid暫時停服，天啊！孩子對積木又不發生興趣了，他又回復了以前的呆滯狀態！無法可想，只得再給他吃Glutamic　Acid（最初微量，以後逐增，）說也奇怪孩子又高高興興的搭起積木，六個月後，孩子竟會走路了。</p>
<p>Glutamic　Acid對於智力　的關係也先後做了不少的試驗。結論是Glutamic　Acid確能增加智力商八——十一，說得再遍「點，智力的進展率可以增大二倍</p>
<p>Glutamic　Acid不但能增進智力，它還能改良人類的個性。一個十六歲的女孩子，表面上看起來，似乎很正常，沒有一點毛病，可是却整天的愁眉不展，不愛交朋友，更怕出外交際，對於學校的各種功課，也感不到絲毫興趣。後來每天給她吃12gm的Glutamic　Acid五個月後，個性大變，她竟整天的笑容滿面，自動去參加各種的活動，學校的成績也大大的進步了。還有一個十二歲的男孩子，照例該是一個無憂無慮活活潑潑的防子，可是事實不然；他舉動遲鈍，思想不能集中，有時還會失去他的自制力，連話都咯咯的說不淸楚。Glutamic　Acid又被開始試用了，起先每日三次，每次　　結果不見起色；於是增加劑量，每日三次每次　　這次Glutamic　Acid的效力來了，孩子變得活潑好動，以前的神經質完全消失了。</p>
<p>雖然Glutamic　Acid的試驗已經達到了相當的成功，可是我們還不能滿足；因為試驗的結果，又告訴我們它的功效不能持久，連續服了一年以後即使再繼續吃下去，智力進展的增加率也會逐漸的减低，並且多吃了，還曾引起失眠與煩惱的副作用（劑量雖無一定的標準，可是一日量不得超過24gm）所以我們還得做更多的試驗來研究，來改善；我們要增强我們的智力，就得先充分利用我們原有的智力！（節譯自一九四七年十一月份皇冠雜誌</p>
<h3>先天性青春早熟</h3>
<p>— 汪美先</p>
<p>「女嬰出世五日　竟有少女情態」</p>
<p>幾個星期以前，申報上曾經有這樣一個哄動福州城的電訊：「廈門石獅巷居民王文成之妻，前日產一女孩，產後一切平常，惟昨接產護士檢查嬰體時，發現該女嬰乳部高聳，乳汁外溢，且有月經現象，出世五日之嬰孩，竟有少女情態，一時哄傳遐邇」。正常的女孩總要到十四五歲的時候，才會兩乳高聳，發現月經等等的靑春期成熟現象，怎麼剛生產五天的女嬰，竟會有少女的情態？</p>
<p>根據上面的報道，絕像是醫學上呌做「先天性女性靑春早熟」的病例，除染色體或遺傳因子的理由外，沒有方法可以解釋它的原因；所以只好冠以「先天性」來代表。這一類的女性靑春期早熟實在比較顆粒性細胞瘤引起的爲多，但是一般婦科專家常常容易最先想起這個病原，以致剖開腹腔，切取活組織片檢査。先天性早熟與顆粒性細胞瘤引起的不同，不但有月經現象，而且可以排卵，就是說年輕輕的小女孩遇機會還可以受姙分娩。曾在一九四〇年秘魯里馬城就發現一個只有五歲另八個月的女孩，生產一個滿月的嬰兒，自己還要別人照料的女孩竟亦做起母親來了，據Novak氏報告中其有九個先天性靑春早熟病例，年齡有十五個月，二歲，二歲八個月，四歲，四歲半，六歲半，七歲及七歲半等（見Amer.J.Obs.&amp;Gyp47.20.1944），只是在我們中國沒有人統計報告，僅當作新聞報導罷了。</p>
<p>遇到這種先天性靑春早熟病例怎麼辦呢？最好是用生理的處置方法，避免小女孩發生一種不自在，自卑或異常的心理，同時在適當年齡以前嚴格避免與異性交接，以免發生受精分娩等意外，這常然是做父母親應該注意的了。</p>
<h3>生物學　製品槪說</h3>
<p>— 汪美先</p>
<p>由於磺酸胺類藥物，靑微菌素，鏈黴菌素的發現與普遍應用，對於革蘭氏染色陰性的淋球菌，腦膜炎球菌，革蘭氏陽性的葡萄狀球菌，鏈鎖狀球菌，肺炎球菌等已經有預防及治療的辦法，所以近年來關於這一類的疫苗血淸已經不再製造與應用了；我們非常希望能有製造簡便，成本低廉，效價準確，而且能大量生產的化學或抗生物製品來代替生物學製品，但就目前來說，許多病原細菌（傷寒，結核，百日咳，白喉，破傷風等桿蓖及霍亂孤菌），列克次體（斑疹傷寒戰壕熱），以及病毒（天花，狂犬病，流行性感冒等），尚無適當的有效化學或抗生物藥品發明以前，生物學製品仍是唯一對症的預防及治療的良法，並且細菌虎疫學方面仍不斷的在發現與改進中，所以望能雙管齊下，兩路並進，以殲滅病原，確保人類的健康。</p>
<p>要想生物學製品保持良好的效價，那麼對於保存的方法一定要切實注意，一般都應該保藏於冷暗的地方，各種製品上都註明有效日期，這些都是按照保存合理的說法，如果保存不得法遇熱遇光的話，就會迅速失效，例如牛痘苗保存　攝氏零度時，有效期間可以保持六個月，如果放置室溫二三個月以後就曾失效，各種細菌疫苗保存於攝氏五至十度　效期間能維持九至十二個月，各種血淸抗毒素保存於攔氏零度可保存有效期間二年，目前我國藥房醫院以及開業醫師多無適當水箱的設備，以及運輸遞寄等，的確都應該注意製品效價與保存的問題。</p>
<p>生物學製品國內可以完全製造，無需仰給外國貨，一般國人素來以為「洋貨總比國貨強」，別的貨不敢武斷，生物學製品應用國貨此洋貨强，因為外國所製各種製品，都用外國流行的菌種製成，未必適合我國流行的菌種，我們用本國流行而最富免疫力的菌種製成，性質比較接近，注射後比較可以發揮免疫力量；所以這一類的製品應該禁止進口，以資節省外匯，就是援助或救濟物品，亦寗願掉換國內不能製迭的機器或原料來，比較實際一點</p>
<p>生物學製品不論用作治療或用作預防，都是注射之劑，直接關係人類生命匪淺，所以製品是否純良，效價是否準確，以及在物理學的，化學的方面是否合格，事先都應該經過妥愼精密的檢定，而後用於人體方之安全；關佈有「細菌學免疫學製品管理規則「，對於國內設廠自製，及國外轍入的製品都有法規管理，可惜沒有嚴格執行，未曾登記許可的製品充斥市塲，暢銷各省市縣鎭，傳聞中的把健康馬血清當作破傷風抗毒素發賣，鼠疫疫苗用無病毒性（Avirulent）的鼠疫桿菌殺死後製造，牛痘苗根本不檢定，高倍稀釋後發售等等，希望這些僅是誤傳而不是事實，組製亂造，偸工减料，在關係人類生命的生物學製品應該沒有這種事，關於私人的製造廠家果然要嚴格依照法令規定執行，公家製　機關亦必須有抽査檢定的規定，由衛生部執行或互相檢定；關於各種生物學製品的製造，檢定，應用等方法，亦應該有一標準的合理的規定，切實的施行那麽民族的健康才有保障。（續完）</p>
<h3>什麼是一般常識？　什麼是醫藥業賞識？</h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>「常識」，這樣一個通俗的名稱，或該說，這樣一句普遍的口頭禪，到底牠的內容是什麼東西呢？要是說：「某人連常識都沒有」，眞好像有點盡侮辱之能事了。然而到底常識的內容是什麼東西呢？</p>
<p>照得現代的社會複雜情形，「馬浪蕩」的三百六十行早已不能包括一切。何况每一行都有特殊發展，因此，行中人的ABC，就是說，每一行的起碼常識，已經不是行外人所能澈底了解。試問「十三點」是什麼？「吃豆腐」是什麼？老在北平的京油子能知道嗎？試問「臘月裏的　蔔是什麼？老在洋塲上的公子哥兒能知道嗎？要說他們連這一點常識都沒有，眞够寃！</p>
<p>從前武則天皇帝。親屬武三思有一句—或該說兩句—至理名言：「同我要好的是好人，同我不要好的不是好人」；我想，在這個主義分歧，爾處我詐的局勢下面，要來他一個「好」與「不好」的定義，恐怕武三思先生的話是最痛快不過的了。列位，我不是在大兜圈子瞎聊天，我是想借重這個例子，來試作一個常識的定義：「對於我有用處的起碼知識是常識，對於我沒有用處的起碼知識不是常識」。這樣一來，那些「司機發材」與「五金魁首」的驕子，何必知道孔夫子呢，孔夫子三個字決不該列入他們的常識。然而他們都知道孔夫子，這是白費。爲什麼會有這樣的白費？爲了點綴塲面！許多當識都是爲了點綴塲面，都是白發，嚴格的說，眞要不得。我很懊悔我也知道孔聖人，我更懊悔我且知道董聖人，康聖人，董康聖人，而不知道搶帽子，吃盤子，以至於潦倒如此。這是關於一般常識。</p>
<p>醫藥常識，常然是一般常識裏邊的另一部份。我們應該知道一些什麼呢？仍舊是那一句話，而且不該說「我們」，只能說「我」或「你」：「什麼是對於你有用處的」。耍是你是一個老頭子，也許你會注意到「蓋世維雄」，耍是你是一個運動家，也許你會注意到維生素B。然而現在的「常識份子」，不必是老頭子，不必是運動家，也都汴意到這些法寳了。結果呢，幾乎每人每天都得吞下一丸「多種維他命」。無疑的，這裏邊有不少的白費，然而好像這也成了一種「常識的塲面」。</p>
<p>列位，在節約期間，不妨迎常識也節約一下；减少一點塲面，减少一點白費。然而什麽是對於我眞正有用的，什麽是對於你眞正有用的，委實難以硬性規定。就是客觀規定下來，也許主觀仍通不過。譬如我，根本不必知道「鈾二百三十五」那一類話，因爲對於我的生活毫無補助，可說無用之至，然而我偏記得。譬如你，假定有開放性肺癆的話，絕對要選免傳及旁人，然而能做到百分之幾呢？烟酒有害是常識，對，酒烟商生意興隆，財源茂盛。閉戶圍火盆有中煤毒之可能，也是常識，對，某一位地質學家却偏在醫院裏邊中了煤毒。這是關於醫藥常識。——嗚呼常識！</p>

<h3>論舊詩的翻譯</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>翻譯這件工作，實在是吃力而難以討好的事。對忠實於原著的翻譯，讀者往往先要有一個外國語文頭腦，才可以讀之而不感頭痛。若是把譯文適合中國語文的格調，難免又要以辭害意，失掉了原作的精神。嚴復所提出翻課的最高目標：信達雅，眞是難以達到的一個理想目標，嚴復自己就沒有能够完全做到這地步。</p>
<p>以一個從事翻譯工作的人來說，現在所能做到的只是從直譯與意譯的界限中求其與原作之近似，而無法把這原作造成另一種文字的拷貝。魯迅譯文學名著，嚴格地主張直譯法，但我得承認他的「死魂靈」譯本是失敗的，如其不用十二分的耐心去唸，往往要中途掩卷。羅稷南譯的「雙城記」，雖然是採用的直譯法，似乎比較順口得多了，但有一個朋友告訴我，他讀譯本時感到非常困難，結果沒有終卷。據我讀過的撥本譯本之中，茅盾所譯弱小民族短篇小說集「桃園」，是一本非常流利的譯本。或許因爲茅盾所根據的是英譯本轉譯，因此用字已轉洗鍊，沒有轉灣抹角的辭藻，譯起中文來也順利得多。</p>
<p>近人中有以文言譯成白話，把唐詩三百首譯過來，改成語體詩，我覺得這是翻譯齣浪費了。唐詩三百首是各家的代表作，句法嚴正，乾淨簡潔，有的時候簡直述註解都不要，何必再把它譯成白話？而且相對之下，這白話詩便顯得脆弱，只懂白話文的人決不能欣賞到它的精華，而今日的一般智識份子，大都對於舊詩有一點認識，看了白話詩更其有東施效顰之感。會寫白話詩，就乾脆寫白話詩，浪費了自己的精神與人家的白報紙去翻譯出這種不知所云的東西，難道眞要努力迭成一個空頭文學家嗎？</p>
<h3>日本太子的女敎師</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>日本皇太子的敎育由一個女子——美國費城敎友派的敎徒伊莉莎白·葛雷·維寗夫人——承担，速是歷史上破題兒第一遭的創舉</p>
<p>裕仁的長子明仁在十二歲以前一直彼堅强的庇護着免受一切的女性的影橱，就是他的母后的影嚮也在防免之例。他生活在一個男性的世界中。</p>
<p>自從美軍佔領三島之後，形勢改變了。隨風轉舵的裕仁對朝廷提出聘請一位有良好的敎育根基的基督敎信徒的美國女子爲他的兒子「師傳」的建議。經過在日本放察敎育的紐約洲的敎育委員喬治·斯滔達博士的推荐，維寗夫人便被提名而中選了。維寗大人認爲她的被選中是由於她的敎友派的訓練和由於她的兩本得　獎的寫給兒童看的著作。</p>
<p>維寗夫人於一九四六年十月在橫演上岸。她的年薪是兩千元美金，外加供給食宿和暖汽。她的翻譯兼秘書是一個由宮內省所選擇的年靑的日本女子，曾在美國留學五年。</p>
<p>日本皇室對維寗夫人的第一年的工作成績極感滿意，所以就將她的聘約續訂了一年。她的影嚮的範圍在逐漸的增加之中。她現在還在敎育明仁的三個姊妹，他的弟弟們和日本皇后。</p>
<p>維寗夫人敎任何功課都操英語。她最初做的事情之一是教明仁拍網球。她畫了一張球塲的岡表，放好球，再敎他「準備」，「分數多少」等這類的英語·這數字是容易移用到其他的事物上去的。</p>
<p>日本皇太子所讀的書着重於合作的重要性。這些書都是講述男孩子和女孩子協力合作齣故事。</p>
<p>維寗夫人一度會由宮內省授權主持訓練日本的未來的領袖的「貴族學校」，敎育七十八個男學生。這個學校如今已大開方便之門，各階層的子弟祗要通過攷試便能入學。明仁除了受維寗夫人的私人課程以外，他也是這個學校的學生之一，這在日本是首遭的皇太子與共他的男孩子一問受基本敎育。維寗夫人說明仁在那裏是快活的，而且不受拘束才在宮中與他的雙親在一起。平時他與他的侍從一同吃住於離東京中心西約二十哩的一所日本式一的所在地。明仁的大部份的時間都是和他的同學們一起在他們的宿舍中消磨掉的。</p>
<p>除此之外，維寗夫人還在「貴婦學校」敎書。日本皇家學校從前一直是男女分校的，現在則掃除日本兩性之間的尖銳的不平等的計劃的一部份。</p>
<p>當維寗夫人的工作完了的時候，明仁也許將放洋到美國去留學。而一個美國女子的工作，對七千八百萬日本人的將來，可能發生了難言的影響。</p>
<h3>名將的簽字</h3>
<p>史蒂威爾將軍在舊金山時，有一個華僑兒童請他簽名留念，史蒂威爾爲表示和他好感起見，用中文簽下了自己的名字。他認爲這是對於巾國兒童應有的禮貌。</p>
<p>「天曉得！」孩子等史蒂威爾離開後咕嚕着說「算算是四星上將，我看不出他寫的是什麼啊！」　（駝）</p>
<h3>小統計</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>

<p>美國的人口佔全世界百分之六，但美國人所有的汽車，佔全世界四分之三，無綫電佔二分之一，冰箱二分之一以上。美國所消耗的羊毛佔全世界三分之一，棉花四分之一，肥皂三分之一，橡皮二分之一以上。</p>

<h3>印第安哲學</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>一個熟心的傳敎士被派至印第安人的部落裘。他眼看着許多年靑的小伙子，整月的坐在草屋前空想人生，有意將他們「心理治療」一下，苦口婆心的勸他們到城市　夫找個工作：</p>
<p>印人（A）：假如我工作，於我何益？</p>
<p>敎士（B）：你可以有錢！你可以買很多的東西！</p>
<p>A：就這樣嗎？</p>
<p>B：你可以做一個益工的，並且有更多的錢。</p>
<p>A：就這樣嗎？</p>
<p>B：啊！你可以做一個經理，假如你工作得勤　！</p>
<p>A：做了經理，於我何益？</p>
<p>B：做了經理，你就有數不完的錢，你就可以不再工作了！</p>
<p>A：天曉得！白面孔（Pale　face，印人稱白種人之謂）!難道我現在已在工作嗎？幹嗎要那麼麻煩去求我已有的呢？</p>
<p>美國人在大西洋裏撐船，印第安人在想像裏撑船。方法雖然不問，道理還是一樣。美國人看着天上的月亮，躍躍欲飛；印第安人看着天上的月亮，沉沉欲睡。從月亮想起了織女，從織女想起了一切的女人，一天就這樣的過去。第二天看着天上的月亮，又有另一套想法，一年就這樣的過去。第二年看着天上的月亮，又有一套更新的想法，一生也就這樣的過去。</p>
<p>印第安人無疑是世界上最聰明的民族，只右他們才最經濟最有效地亨受了人生。你化了四萬五千元錢，肉痛地踏進電影院，是爲了亨受。但他們只要不名一文的在草屋前神往一番，即可得到同樣的亨受。你是看了，他們是想了。看過完了，想過也是完了。而享受則一。因此印第安人的哲學：假如你要做大衣，不必東借西挪的徒費精力，想着穿大衣就是了；假使你要享口福，不必到大飯店去遭侍者白眼，想着吃全席就是了。你只要默坐斗室，想着你正在過那些沒右戰爭，沒有欺騙的「好的舊日子」，吃八元錢一担的大米，啃三個銅元一個的大餅，你就不覺莞爾了。假如你天天這樣想，年年這樣想，你就眞的在過太平日子了！</p>
<p>「空」中自有黃金屋。「空」巾自有千鍾栗。「空」中自有顏如玉。並不是我鼓勵你生神經官能病，是時代逼你這樣做了。</p>
<h3>想起嚴高</h3>
<p>— 周冷</p>
<p>嚴高這一家族的貪汚，是史有定論了的，他們巧取豪奪的事跡，這裏且不去談它，單據天水冰山錄記載遭籍沒時所抄出的財產，起碼就有五千餘件，重要的有：淨金連金製器皿首飾三萬二千九百多雨，凈銀連銀製器皿首飾二百零二萬七千多兩，珍珠寳王琥珀珊瑚等珍品三千八百多兩，段絹紗裘萬一萬四千多匹，第宅樓舖房莊五十七座，田地二十七萬七千多畝，而放債，糧食，家蓄，用具等還不算在內。</p>
<p>無疑，這筆財產就是貪汚的證據，而數字的鉅大，也足驚人，可是，我對這些却一點也不感到奇怪，因爲他們執政當權達二十年，二十年的積累，當然應該有這個「成績」。反過來我奇怪的倒是：爲什麼宋朝在他當權的任何一個時候不去及早裁制他們，而要在嚴高罷官以後，起房買屋才來計算舊賬？我更奇怪的是：當局處理這事，明知這些財產是榨取民間，而不拿來發還被害的家屬，何以竟然一道聖旨，「盡數收沒，入官送部，不許親識人等，侵匿受寄？」</p>
<p>要是由此而更深一層察看，有宋一代，籍沒貪官汚吏家產的案件，較任何一個朝代都多。而從劉瑾，錢寗，江彬，以至嚴高，和珅，所有憑藉官勢而發大財者，結果都如出一轍，而當局的處理辦法，也差不多一樣的是「財產送官」。官者，在家天下的朝代，自然就屬於皇帝私人。而天眞的老百姓，當然是不了解此中微妙的。</p>
<p>這道理大槪嚴嵩是看到了的，因爲據天水冰山錄序南邨老叟說：「翁（嵩）罷相歸，檢其私藏，見黃金三十萬，白金二百萬，驚日：「此將來禍胎歟，可亟進之，或望免患。」會世蕃率家人環泣而止。」可惜在最後關頭不下決心，結果仍上了別人的大當！</p>
<p>我並不是替嚴嵩這類貪官汚吏辯護，我僅是指出：嚴嵩雖然可憎，但嚴嵩乃至其他貪官的落得如此收塲，也還是中了「皇帝老子」的錦囊妙計而已。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第八章　功敗垂成　（五〇）</p>
<p>鳳笙堅起食指道：「第二條件，我們離婚不必公布，祗和你私下簽約了事，我不高興要取消時，就得取消，你可沒裡取消，你敢辦嗎？」渚齊把頭點一點道：「這個也可以。」鳳笙再豎起中指道：「第三條件，我們離婚後，你不得再娶，我也不得再嫁。」渚齊不由噗哧一笑道：「要照這條件，我們又何必離婚呢？」鳳笙氣忿忿道：「那末你是要再娶一個了！」渚齊默然不語。鳳笙氣極，伸著食指向渚齊額上一戮道：「你這沒良心東西，我早知道你的心意，那末，你就再娶吧，可是你要當心，我有權力取消離婚合約，我是正太太，你取個偏房，我有權力管她。」渚齊道：「我娶不娶，現在還談不到，你有沒有權力管，更談不到。我祗問你，還有別的條件沒有？如僅僅這兩條條件，我便答應。」鳳笙道：「你敢答應就把約字寫來。」渚齊肚子裏，早打好稿子，一聽呌他寫字，立時找好紙，拿著自來水筆　　寫下，不消十幾分鐘，兩紙離婚書，便寫就了，把自來水筆，遞給鳳笙道：「請你簽字吧！」鳳笙把自來水筆接過來，盡了花押，不由一陣心酸，眼淚滾滾流下，把筆向桌上一丟，緊走兩步伏在床上哭了。渚齊看了，心裏也有些不忍，一手扶著頭，斜倚桌前，心裏祗是躊躇，覺得如此耍弄她，於道德上說不過去，於是走到床前，在鳳笙背上輕輕一拍道：「你不要難過，我們感情仍要維持，我仍是不斷來看你，你有什麼事，我仍可努力帮忙。」鳳笙把渚齊一推，哭道：「去你的吧，我不會說假話，旣然離婚，還有什麼感情！你不要再騙我，我也不再受你的騙了，去！去！不用再花言巧語，你的心，我早看透了！」渚齊要給她一拒絕，不便再說什麼，隨由衣袋裏，拿出五百萬元鈔票，　在鳳笙枕旁道：「這一點款子先交給你，不夠時可由電話通知我，我會再來看你。」說着，又在她肩背上輕輕拍了兩下道：「你要保重身體，我們各有前途的。」鳳笙這時已哭成淚人一般，渚齊輕輕離開屋內，走到房門口，遇見使喚的張媽吩咐道：「少奶奶生氣，你好好伺候。」隨走到外面，開起衣櫃，把隨身衣服，裝了一小提箱，拿了出去，張媽送他到門口，問什麼時候回來，渚齋道：「我還要到天津去，最近這幾天不能回來的。」隨僱一輛三輪車到銀行宿舍，把一切東西安頓好了，隨發一急電通知綺紈。（本章完）</p>
<h3>受辱記</h3>
<p>— 賈儀</p>
<p>電車站上擠滿了人，我深悔今天出門太遲，往常七點半以前到車站，總不會遇見這許多人擠着候車的；此刻已是七點三刻，離上課祗有二十五分鐘了。一輛，二輛疾馳而來的電車，滿載了乘客，到站都不停留地開了過去，我焦憤地喊出一聲：「他」—「媽」字剛要出口，眼前一亮，瞥見一位嬌美的女郎正走近我身前；我趕忙改了一句：「豈有此理！到站怎麼不停車？</p>
<p>第三輛車總算到站就停下了，而且車上的鐵門正對着我身前的女郎，照理說祇等一開門，她便可一步跨上車去；但是頃刻間後面和兩旁的羣衆擁前來，左邊的人攀住右邊的握手，檔住了右面齣人；右邊的人也偏是左脚先跨向前，攔住了左面的人；一時軋住了，誰也上不了車。我身後有一股偉大的力量在推着我，平時，我也許會不耐煩地轉身咒駡一二句，此刻，我正好乘勢向前去把這位女客推了上去，我當然也就緊緊的跟了上去。她倒始終未曾轉過臉來，我想她擠車子，這種待遇大概是受慣了的。於是我想到，以後妻要出去，悄願多化些錢雇一輛三輸車，別讓人家「捧」上電車去。</p>
<p>車廂裘是擠不進了，祗好挨在開車的身旁，開車的發脾氣說擠得他車也不能開，我正好責問他爲什麼前面一輛車到了站都不停車？開車的向我看了一眼，沒有回什麼話。</p>
<p>時間已經八點過了五分，今天到學校準要遲到，可恨這開車的一面自已發脾氣說人擠，一面可又是逢站必停，總　人家硬擠上一二個，我看看面前的女郎委實被擠得窘苦，就向開車的說：「車上已經這麽擠，到站要沒有人下去，你就別伴，一直往前開好了。」</p>
<p>「嗨！你剛才怎麼說的？你罵前面二輛車子到站不停。你在底下是一樣說法，到了車上又是一樣說法！看看你先生倒是滿有知識的，怎麼—怎麽—？唉！中國人就是這個脾氣。」</p>
<p>偶是那女郎又轉臉來向我譏嘲地一笑，美是美的，可是此刻我眞受不了，臉上刺刺的發熱，轉眼看車上幸虧沒有我的學生在，否則。心裏祇想到一句話：「禮失求諸野」確是不錯。</p>
<h3>奇談雜綴</h3>

<p>律師爲被告辯稱：「請庭上注意，被告根本沒有破入那個屋子里去。他只是見窗開着，把右手伸了進去，拿了幾件無足輕重的東西。須知被告的手並不即等於被告本身，為了被告的一只手臂所做的事，怎麼可以處罰被告本人呢？」</p>
<p>推事說：「你的辯詞眞是有理得很。我現在就依照你的理論判被告的手臂徒刑一年。被告是否隨了手臂一同進獄，可以悉聽被告的便。」</p>
<p>被告聆判，便欣然移下了他的軟手臂，走出了法庭。</p>
<p>敎師對幼童講完了一個關於一隻小羊擅自離開了羊羣而被狼吃掉的故事對幼童說：「你看，如果小羊能够服從，不離開羊羣，牠便不會被狼吃掉了，是不是？」</p>

<h3>留額金</h3>
<p>— 言平</p>
<p>寒假已近在目前，雖然還沒放假，而各家長對於子女的敎育問題，莫不又感到嚴重的苦悶和成脅。而本學期的學業報告單，尚未見到，却先惠陽了一紙徵收「留額金」的通知信。</p>
<p>留額金，似乎是已成「名正言順」的名目。校方托詞學額有限，爲了優待舊生起見，付了留額金，便可保留名額，否則競招收新生補充，以免損及收入。其實，我看無非是借「留額金」的名義派一注用塲。尤其是在這農曆的歲尾年頭。</p>
<p>好在家長們但求子女有書讀，區區的留額金不致於斤斤計較，何况通知書上該着「逾期不繳者，作新生論」的校令呢？</p>
<p>記得不久以前，當局頒布在過，不准收「留額金」的命令。然而命令祗是命令而已，事實則又是事實！有人說，這項命令僅指公立學校而言，私立學校可以不受此限，那麼「敎育不分公私」的原則，豈不又遭了打擊和壞？</p>
<p>若是「留額」是求學的必需手續，何必一定要收保證「金」？而它的金額何必又須在學費的十分之一以上？</p>
<p>依筆者的管見，何不將「金」字改作「瞪」字或「書」字，在放假時，由家長出具申請書之類，保證其子女下學期決不轉學，請校方留額登記。這樣，校方便可以根埤留額的人數，作支配，預算，招生…………等工作，「雙方兼顧，公私兩便」，不知敎育當局以爲如何？</p>
<p>「我最愛喬治的一點，就　　　情形之下總是那樣的不慌不忙。」</p>

<h3>National Economic Commission Discusses and Decides: Foreign Exchange Policy Will Not Be Revised; Measures for Purchasing Export Goods Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The issue of whether or not to revise the foreign exchange policy was discussed at the routine meeting of the National Economic Commission on the 22nd. Wang Yunwu believed that the current foreign exchange policy had points that could be modified, or even opened up. Pan Xulun, on the other hand, believed that the British foreign exchange policy could be used as a reference, to purchase a portion of export foreign exchange, and that the current foreign exchange policy should be reformed. Zhang Qun immediately stated that revising the foreign exchange policy was a major issue, and its impact could lead to an irreparable crisis. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the import-export linkage should remain in place with the current methods, and no revisions should be drafted.</p>
<p>The measures for purchasing export goods were examined by the subcommittee of the National Economic Commission on the 17th, and then presented to the full commission for discussion on the 22nd, where they were amended and approved. The full text is as follows: (A) Purchase principles: Export goods shall be handled by merchants in accordance with the government's regulations on import and export exchange settlement, mainly through free transport. However, when merchants encounter difficulties in exporting, the Export-Import Management Committee may decide on purchase measures. (B) Types of goods to be purchased: Tung oil, soybeans, raw silk, egg products, pork, tea, and wool, totaling seven types. Other special local industrial products will also be considered for purchase. (C) Purchasing agencies: The Central Trust of China shall handle the purchases, and may entrust other business agencies to undertake the work. (D) Purchase prices: The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Auditing Department, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Joint Office of the Four Banks, the Export-Import Management Committee, the Central Bank, and the Central Trust of China shall each send representatives to form a purchase price review committee, which shall be convened by the Export-Import Management Committee. The prices set shall take into consideration the profits of producers as a principle. (E) Purchase quality: The quality of export goods must be standardized, and the Bureau of Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall conduct strict inspections. Profits and losses from exported goods shall be borne by the national treasury.</p>
<p>It is also learned that regarding industrial loans, the Joint Office of the Four Banks may draft specific measures and submit them to the Chairman for approval.</p>
<h3>Implementation Measures for the Commercial and Transportation Sections of the Economic Program Amended and Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Economic Commission held its 31st routine meeting at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Chairman Zhang Qun and Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuxian reported on the domestic economic situation in the 36th year and the effects of the government's measures to address the four waves of price increases, making detailed comparisons and analyses, and pointing out the reasons for the increases. They also read out the resolutions of the eighth price conference. Zhang Qun then announced a temporary change to the agenda to discuss: Amended and approved measures for purchasing export goods; Amended and approved implementation measures for the commercial section of the economic reform program; Amended and approved implementation measures for the transportation section of the economic reform program. During the discussion, regarding the original proposal 2 in the commercial section, item 4 of the implementation measures stipulated "Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and set a deadline for prohibiting their sale in the market." Some committee members proposed deleting this, arguing that luxury goods should still be allowed to be imported, but only after increasing their tariffs or raising stamp taxes could they be sold in the market. However, this was opposed by the majority of committee members, who believed that the purpose of prohibiting the import of luxury goods and setting a deadline for prohibiting their sale was to save foreign exchange, not to increase tax revenue. The committee members spoke enthusiastically and debated for a long time. In the end, the original regulations were approved. The main revisions to the commercial section are as follows: The five items listed in the original proposal 3, item 5, on promoting import-export joint operations, were deleted; the implementation measures for the original proposal 4, regarding the enrichment and improvement of cooperative business and its connection with international cooperation, will be drafted separately (see the full text of the implementation measures on the first page of this newspaper on the 10th). The main revisions to the transportation section are as follows: In the original proposal 4, item A, "Port management," was retained, and separate measures will be formulated for port management, to be operated and managed separately by the central or municipal competent authorities; all five measures stipulated in item C, "Increase the tonnage of private shipping vessels," regarding "Encouraging private steps," were deleted (see the full text of the implementation measures on the fifth page of this newspaper on the 10th and 17th). The meeting also discussed the implementation measures for the national water conservancy section of the economic reform program. Because the original draft measures had many discrepancies in content and style, they will be handed over to the Ministry of Water Conservancy to draft separate measures.</p>
<h3>Second Day of Legislative Yuan Elections: Chairman and Wife Personally Vote; Each Circles Liu Baimin and Liu Hengjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] Chairman Jiang and his wife went to the Daxing Palace polling station together at 4:40 PM on the 22nd to vote in their capacity as citizens and elect members of the Legislative Yuan. It was raining heavily at the time, but the voting time was extremely short, and the procedures were quick. They left in just two minutes. Chairman Jiang circled Liu Baimin as a member of the Legislative Yuan, while his wife circled Liu Hengjing. When the Chairman and his wife stepped out of the polling station, dozens of students stood by the roadside to see them off, shouting "Long live the Chairman!" - The Chairman smiled and nodded before getting into the car and leaving.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Vice Chairman Sun Ke, President of the Examination Yuan Dai Chuanxian, and Minister Wang Shijie went to various polling stations on the 22nd to vote and elect members of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The 22nd was the second day of voting in the Legislative Yuan elections. Various campaign activities did not cool down due to the rain. The news reporters' groups voted at the Jieshou Hall. Various campaign slogans were unique. Some sought voters with historical experience, while others sought voters with political views. Among the reporters campaigning in Nanjing, in addition to Chen Bosheng and Huang Shaogu, who were originally in Nanjing, Chang Tuichen and Cheng Cangbo were the most active. A total of 858 members of the Reporters Association voted, and 781 votes were cast by the end of the voting. The remaining 77 people abstained. The voters accounted for more than 90% of the total number of votes, which was higher than the proportion in the previous election of National Assembly representatives. Observers speculate that Huang Shaogu and Chen Bosheng received the most votes from reporters in Nanjing, followed by Chen and Cheng Cangbo. (Election results from various places are published in the left corner of the second page)</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou Has Violent Wind and Heavy Snow; Legislative Yuan Elections Postponed</h3>

Among those elected as representatives of the National Assembly and members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, whether there are those who have been subject to legal punishment or disciplinary action, and whose punishment has not yet ended. If there are the above circumstances, they should be listed separately to investigate whether those who participated in the election or were elected have engaged in bribery.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] Representatives of the signatories of the Elected National Assembly Representatives Association, Ma Wenche and others, visited Wu Tiecheng at the Central Party Headquarters at 9:30 AM on the 22nd at Wu's invitation. Ma and others stated that the source of election disputes was the failure to respect public opinion in accordance with the Constitution, which prevented elected candidates from being regularly elected. Wu stated that this time, the nomination of candidates in various places fully demonstrated the prestige of Zhu Neng and the candidates, and that the candidates nominated by the political parties did not seek the support of voters, resulting in their failure to win a majority of votes and be elected. Wu also promised to convey their opinions to the Standing Committee of the Central Committee for a reasonable decision.</p>

<h3>Fujian Province Asks the Central Government to Continue Subsidizing Provincial Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Correspondent, 22nd] Since the central government decided to adjust the salaries of civil servants, change to issuing salaries based on the index, and transfer the funding of provincial-level departments to local responsibility, the financial situation in Fujian Province has become increasingly strained. It is reported that in the past, 90% of the salaries and stipends of civil servants in Fujian Province relied on central government subsidies. Now that the expenses are huge and the subsidies have been suddenly cut off, the provincial treasury cannot cope. The Fujian provincial authorities, in addition to consulting with Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces to jointly telegraph the central government requesting continued subsidies, Finance Director Fang Dong also flew to Nanjing yesterday to plead for assistance.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender Issuance Amount: 28 Trillion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The report that the amount of government banknote issuance has reached 28 trillion yuan has been confirmed by official sources today.

<h3>Baoding's Periphery Trending Toward Calm; Southern Tianjin Stable as National Army Continues Sweeping; National Army in Shanxi Recovers Pucheng and Yishi</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 22nd] In the triangle area of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding, a major battle is brewing. The 8th and 9th Brigades of Nie Rongzhen's troops, at 6:00 PM, fled north from Xiong County to He, Gaozhuang, Xiliucun, Yangjiafang, and other places, engaging in fierce battles with the National Army under Wang Fenggang. The Beiping military has dispatched a large army to reinforce the sweeping operation. The situation in southern Tianjin has stabilized. On the afternoon of the 20th, the National Army advanced to Jinghai Dongfu to conduct a sweeping operation. The Communist bandits' southern Tianjin detachment suffered dozens of casualties, and the Xiaozhan forces also collapsed southward.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Correspondent, 22nd] Communist bandits around Baoding continued to retreat last night. Official intelligence: The 2nd Column crossed the Daqing River at Dong'anzhen, 30 li east of Baoding, on the night of the 20th and fled to Gaoyang.

<h3>No Progress in Sino-British Negotiations on the Kowloon Walled City and Shamian Incidents; Taikoo Guangzhou Liner Service Resumes Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] There was no progress in the Sino-British negotiations in Nanjing on the 22nd regarding the Kowloon Walled City and Guangzhou Shamian incidents. This seems to be due to the British side's presentation of compensation demands and our Foreign Ministry's reiteration of its position, which has reduced the number of contacts. The British Embassy is still awaiting instructions from London on the negotiations regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident. Our side is currently considering the note delivered by the British side on the 21st, and hopes that appropriate solutions can be negotiated for both incidents one after the other, and resolved simultaneously.</p>

<h3>To Improve the Political and Economic Situation in North China, Premier Zhang Invites Petitioning Groups Today to Discuss Concrete Plans; Supervisory Yuan Actively Investigates Malpractices in the Transportation of Grain from the South to the North</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] Zhang Qun has scheduled a meeting at 6:30 PM on the 23rd to invite representatives from the North China Petitioning Groups and the heads of relevant ministries and commissions to discuss concrete and feasible plans to improve the political, social, and economic conditions in the North. A banquet will be held after the meeting. Zhang Jia'ao will also rush from Shanghai to attend. The petitioning groups received urgent news from the North on the 23rd that various difficulties must be resolved before the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Supervisory Committee members Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting went to the Ministry of Grain and the Ministry of Finance on the 22nd to investigate the request of the North China petitioning groups to improve the economic situation. At 10:00 AM, they first went to the Ministry of Grain to inquire about the grain quota allocation and permit fees. They discovered that the Ministry of Grain had entrusted the power to decide on the grain quota allocation to corrupt grain merchants, which caused many malpractices, and that the permit fee of 150,000 yuan was also derived from this. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, they went to the Ministry of Finance. Because various related businesses had been assigned to the Central Bank, the Joint Office of the Four Banks, and the Export-Import Management Committee, there were no results. They will conduct investigations at the relevant agencies in the coming days, and if necessary, the Shanghai Supervisory Envoy Office will conduct investigations in Shanghai, or they will personally go to Shanghai.

<p>Sheng Zhenwei Speaks in the United States: Our Greatest Difficulty is Inflation</p>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 21st] Sheng Zhenwei, Dean of the Law School of Soochow University and a member of the Legislative Yuan, returned to China after inspecting European and American legal systems. He stated here today that the United Nations should establish a security force to prevent any country from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The Chinese limitation problem is part of the world problem. The greatest difficulty is inflation. How can inflation be stopped when the war continues? How can the war be stopped? China has been at war for ten years, and we cannot deal with another enemy alone, such as the terrible inflation. Sheng said of his mission, "The Chinese government has decided to make the judiciary acceptable to both Chinese and foreigners alike. This does not mean that we want our laws to imitate your laws, but we hope that our judges and lawyers are familiar with the principles of Anglo-American law, so that Chinese courts can have more understanding when handling cases involving foreigners."</p>

The US Congress and the people have always been concerned about the Chinese people, and this move will make them even more convinced that the Chinese government is using US aid effectively and properly. Due to the global food shortage, the Chinese people may only be able to hope to obtain the minimum amount of supplies from abroad, but as a result of fair distribution, the Chinese people will surely benefit equally.</p>

<h3>Canadian Ship Carries Military Supplies to China; Includes Four Mosquito Aircraft</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Halifax, Canada, 21st] The Canadian cargo ship "Island Courier" sailed from Halifax on the 21st to China, carrying aircraft and military supplies to aid the Chinese National Government.

<h3>Negotiations Between China and Mexico on Silver Halt; Hope for US Loan to Stabilize Currency</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Well-informed diplomatic sources claim that the Chinese government has decided to halt negotiations with the Mexican government regarding the minting of new silver coins. They state that instead, their hopes are placed on a currency stabilization plan. This plan was brought to Washington by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi, head of the Chinese technical delegation, seeking the endorsement and assistance of the United States. Mr. Pei has not yet had the opportunity to present the plan, which requests the United States to provide $300 million as a "stabilization fund" to serve as reserves for issuing new Chinese currency. Sources say that during discussions with US officials, Mr. Pei will request that the US prioritize the stabilization fund, with other forms of assistance being secondary. The US is currently attempting to provide a large portion of long-term assistance in the form of goods and reconstruction machinery. However, the Chinese believe that implementing the agreed-upon fund measures simultaneously would be more effective. Sources also state that silver negotiations between China and Mexico began last autumn but were later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Finance because the Kuomintang did not fully believe that purchasing silver would yield satisfactory results. They claim that the negotiations may have involved the Mexican government minting silver coins worth approximately $250 million to $300 million for China to replace nearly worthless Chinese paper currency, with China repaying Mexico with goods. However, these sources also state that Kuomintang financial experts believe it is unwise to allow Chinese currency to be manipulated by fluctuations in the silver market; therefore, the current negotiations with Mexico have never been given much attention. They claim that these negotiations have now effectively halted.</p>
<p>**Pei Tsu-yi's Mission**</p>
<p>Concurrently, reliable Chinese and American sources claim that opinions differ greatly between US officials and the delegation led by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi regarding their true mission here. According to these sources, the Chinese believe that Mr. Pei has some direct authority regarding the issue of the US lending China over $300 million within 15 months, but the Americans believe that Mr. Pei's delegation is merely a delegation engaged in purely technical discussions, as speculated externally. They state that the Americans have indicated that they deeply hope Mr. Pei and his colleagues can provide advice on the detailed issues of implementing the American plan, but the Americans have not considered whether the Chinese side has any say in policy consultations. They point out that Mr. Pei's delegation has only had one contact with State Department officials at a luncheon on the 19th, followed by a meeting in Assistant Secretary of State Thorp's office in the afternoon. There were no meetings between Chinese and American officials on the 20th and 21st; Mr. Pei's delegation only met with lower-ranking technical officials. According to sources who participated in the meeting on the 19th, the discussion was only a general discussion of the Chinese economic situation, but neither side suggested any specific measures. At the same time, it is said that members of Mr. Pei's delegation hope that the American aid-to-China plan, which is scheduled to begin in April for 15 months, can be increased to $500 million. However, Americans unanimously believe that the Chinese people's interpretation of figures that is beneficial to them may be wrong.</p>
<p>**Differing Opinions Between China and the US**</p>
<p>Some Chinese officials here still hope that, in addition to foreign aid, the Chinese government may also be able to persuade the Export-Import Bank of the United States to approve loans under its previous plan related to the $500 million loan. Chinese and American officials hold extremely different views on how to promote economic recovery. It is not yet clear this week what impact this difference of opinion will have on the final form of the US-limited plan. However, Mr. Pei's delegation still hopes that they can influence the final decision of the United States to some extent. So far, Mr. Pei has not met with Secretary of State Marshall or Undersecretary Lovett. He has no power over any plan. At the same time, some members of Congress are now using pressure on the State Department to advocate for aid to China. Congressman Judd claimed that unless the State Department submits the plan to Congress soon, he will publicly demand that the government announce the aid-to-China plan.</p>
<h3>Our Technical Representatives Meet with US Officials; Secret Discussions on Aid-to-China Plan; Hoover Suggests Including China in Foreign Aid Bill</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Relevant sources state that the US aid-to-China plan is currently being discussed here "secretly" by our technical representatives and the US State Department. At 10:30 a.m. on the 21st, our delegation, led by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi and Mr. Li, held a meeting with US officials at the US State Department, during which a preliminary "technical discussion" of the aid-to-China plan was conducted. The State Department explained that the talks between China and the United States cannot be strictly referred to as negotiations, as informal discussions must be conducted outside the State Department from time to time. It is also said that because discussions between US officials and foreign representatives involving financial assistance plans in the past have all been conducted in secret, the discussion on aid to China this time is no exception. The State Department also insisted that in the preliminary talks, State Department officials only listened to the Chinese delegation's report on China's financial situation and what steps the Chinese government has taken to improve this situation. It is rumored that since arriving here on the 15th, our representatives have not submitted any plans or requests to the US side. It is not yet known whether our government intends to submit a plan to the US State Department. It is also said that the discussions have not yet reached the stage where the US State Department will show the Chinese representatives a draft of its aid-to-China plan. Well-informed sources say that before the State Department submits a final request to Congress, the Chinese delegation will be given the opportunity to see a blueprint of the State Department's plan, which will list an amount exceeding $300 million.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Former President Hoover, on the 21st, asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to expand the scope of the Marshall Plan to include China, Japan, Korea, and Germany, and to further reduce the initial $6.8 billion in European recovery funds for the first 15 months. Mr. Hoover claimed that this would not weaken the US economy or undermine world recovery. All $3 billion in aid to Europe for food, coal, fertilizer, and cotton should be provided as grants, as unsecured loans are unlikely to be repaid. It is unwise for the four-year aid-to-Europe plan to be accompanied by spiritual constraints; we cannot force independent and autonomous nations to accept any ideology. In addition, a joint committee of Democrats and Republicans must be established by both government and civilians to manage aid affairs in 16 European countries, China, Japan, Korea, and Germany.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, publicly released a letter to Secretary of State Marshall on the 21st, which called for the immediate submission of the aid-to-China plan to Congress. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Denouncing Britain's Four Demands</h3>
<p>Our newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch, after receiving instructions from London, the British Embassy in China sent a document to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs containing four demands regarding the unfortunate incident in Shamian, Guangzhou: 1. The Chinese government should take responsibility for the Shamian incident; 2. Thoroughly investigate the cause of this unfortunate incident and severely punish the perpetrators; 3. Compensate for the losses and provide relief to the British nationals who suffered damage; 4. Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th, British Minister of State McNeil also mentioned the Shamian incident when answering questions from members of the House of Commons, and stated that the British government had made four demands to the Chinese authorities: compensation, investigation, punishment of the perpetrators, and guarantees; enough to prove the accuracy and authenticity of this newspaper's report. The Shamian incident occurred as a result of the Kowloon incident. Our diplomatic authorities have repeatedly negotiated with the British government regarding the Kowloon incident, but London has remained silent. Now, suddenly presenting four demands regarding the Shamian incident first, attempting to shift the focus of negotiations to the Shamian incident, we cannot help but think that the British side has an attempt to "put the cart before the horse." British diplomacy has always been known for its ruthlessness. Our diplomatic authorities must raise their awareness and must not handle the Kowloon incident and the Shamian incident, which have a causal relationship, separately.</p>
<p>We calmly and objectively discuss the matter as it stands. The occurrence of the Shamian incident was entirely due to the atrocities of the Hong Kong police. Without the Kowloon incident, the Shamian incident would not have occurred. The reason is very clear. Therefore, not only is the Chinese government not responsible, but the entire responsibility should be borne by the British government. In terms of legal principles, the jurisdiction of Kowloon City belongs to the Chinese government, which is a fact that the British government cannot deny. The Hong Kong authorities' demolition of houses in the old city of Kowloon is not only illegal but also infringes upon our country's sovereignty over Kowloon City. The Hong Kong police's shooting at unarmed residents is an unforgivable atrocity. Even if we disregard legal principles and consider human feelings, after the war, both China and Britain are in difficult and arduous periods, and both are advocating thrift in the economy and seeking the stability of people's livelihoods. The Hong Kong authorities, ignoring the suffering of the Chinese people, intend to demolish the houses in the old city of Kowloon in the name of "hygiene" and "fire prevention" and turn them into parks. Its impracticality and inappropriateness are obvious. The Hong Kong side may say that it has designated other areas to allow the original residents to build houses, and there is a remedial measure. However, it seems that we should no longer insist on not moving. But in today's material conditions and widespread poverty, building houses elsewhere is not an easy task. The Hong Kong side, not only failing to empathize with the suffering of the Chinese people but also using violence to drive them away, is an act that, no matter from which angle we observe it, cannot but be considered a re-exposure of the face of British imperialists.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong side's treatment of the residents of Kowloon fully exposes the imperialist style of dealing with colonies. It is difficult for the Chinese people, who are striving for independence and autonomy after the war, to tolerate it, especially the general intellectuals, who have long demanded that the government recover the special status of Hong Kong and Kowloon so that China will no longer have any defects in its territorial integrity. Therefore, anti-British demonstrations have occurred one after another in Guangdong, Shanghai, and other places. The blame lies in the British side's infringement of our sovereignty and the Hong Kong police's atrocities. The British government cannot blame any party. And the burning of the British Consulate in Shamian was an excessive action taken by the communists using mass movements. The authorities have obtained sufficient evidence. The Shanghai British-owned newspaper North China Daily News's editorial on the 19th, "Communist Agitation," also admitted that this was done by the communists and said that the communists' intention was not only to disrupt local order but also to contain a conspiracy to provoke and expand the unfortunate incident between China and Britain. During this period of suppressing the rebellion, preventing the communists' disruptive actions is indeed the responsibility of the Chinese local governments, but the Hong Kong side created the incident, aroused the anger of the Chinese people, and caused mass movements, and villains took the opportunity to cause chaos. Temporary measures were difficult to prevent. Moreover, after the Shamian incident occurred, the Chinese government immediately ordered all local governments across the country to step up prevention of communist sabotage and to strictly protect the lives and property of British nationals. Although students in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places also held anti-British demonstrations, no similar unfortunate incidents occurred in Shamian. It can be seen from this that the Chinese government is not responsible in reality, and a study of the origin of the chaos lies in the atrocities of the Hong Kong police, which has led to the occurrence of the Shamian incident. No matter how strongly the Hong Kong side argues, it cannot shirk its responsibility for the occurrence of the Shamian incident in the end.</p>
<p>As for punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation, the communists' taking the opportunity to cause trouble not only hinders local order but also undermines Sino-British relations. The crimes they have committed can be punished in accordance with our country's criminal law. Fortunately, the perpetrators who set fire to the British Consulate have all been arrested and can be handed over to the court for handling in accordance with the law. However, we must state that punishing the communists who committed arson is our country's internal affair and does not allow outside interference. Britain cannot and should not demand that our country severely punish them. Based on this, Britain's proposal of this demand is indeed an unfriendly move, and our country cannot possibly change it. Secondly, there is the compensation for the losses of British nationals. British nationals are fine. It is unfortunate that they have suffered accidental damage. Standing from a humanitarian position, we should sympathize with them, and we can consider providing compensation for their losses, but it must be handled in accordance with international practices. Mr. Shi, Director of the Information Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has already stated that our foreign party authorities will handle this matter in this way, which is a clear arrangement.</p>
<p>The British diplomatic authorities' abandoning the Kowloon issue and proposing four demands regarding the Shamian incident are truly inappropriate actions. Not only is it putting the cart before the horse, but it not only cannot resolve the outstanding issues between China and Britain but also makes Sino-British negotiations take a turn for the worse, which may have an adverse impact on the future of Sino-British relations. We cannot but express our regret over this. Since then, under the leadership of the Labour Party, the British government's enlightened measures in both domestic and foreign affairs have been applauded by the world. In particular, Britain's Far East policy is not only able to adapt to the situation but also has a long-term vision. Its allowing India and Burma to become independent has been something that previous British governments did not dare to do, but the Labour Party has done it. We cannot but admire Prime Minister Attlee's wise decision. Hong Kong and Kowloon should be returned to China. Not only does the United States recognize this as a matter of course, but even enlightened British people also believe so. However, the Labour government has been slow to fulfill its gentleman's agreement to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, and retaining this stain in Sino-British relations has left us greatly puzzled. Some British people may say that China's internal unrest has not yet ended, and the return of Hong Kong and Kowloon must wait for the future. This statement is truly unreasonable. Frankly speaking, what does Britain's return of Hong Kong and Kowloon have to do with China's internal affairs? It is clearly a disguise. Therefore, we ask the British diplomatic authorities to broaden their horizons and look far ahead. On the one hand, they must see the current situation in the Far East clearly. On the other hand, they must also have self-awareness. Should Britain continue to adopt imperialist policies in the Far East after the war? Is it worthy of retaining its pre-war colonies? Because we cherish the warmth that Britain gave us during the war, we are especially willing to maintain friendly relations with Britain and do not want the Kowloon incident to escalate. Britain should also think about it for both China and Britain. How can the old hatred of a century of hostility be allowed to exist? How can the spirit of the equal new treaty not be respected? To put it bluntly, Britain should adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Shamian incident, turning major issues into minor issues, and minor issues into no issues. How can it raise demands to agitate the emotions of the Chinese people at a time when Chinese people's emotions are running high? In short, the British diplomatic authorities need to reconsider these two incidents.</p>

<h3>Bridges' Letter to Marshall</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Bridges stated in his letter: "Only by immediately submitting to Congress a plan to protect the significant concerns of the American people for China's independence can we create good public confidence in the authorities' Far East policy and enable us to have ample opportunity to carefully study the aid plan."</p>
<p>Bridges recalled that Marshall, in his joint report to the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees in November last year, had said that a definite aid-to-China plan was being prepared and would be submitted to Congress as soon as possible. Bridges said that Assistant Secretary of State Sepp had reported to the Senate Appropriations Committee on December 17 that the State Department was prepared to submit a China plan at the beginning of the Congress' regular session. Bridges claimed in his two letters: "It has been two weeks since the regular session of Congress opened, and the State Department has not yet submitted an aid-to-China plan to Congress. Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, relying on the statements of Your Excellency and Mr. Sepp, have had their actions affected by the temporary aid plan."</p>
<p>Bridges reminded Marshall that General Wedemeyer, representing the President's special investigation of the situation in China, testified during the Appropriations Committee hearing that he did not believe that the United States had fulfilled its promises to China in recent years, and said that he believed that the United States should provide China with military supplies and economic assistance, which was now a matter of urgency. Bridges claimed that the replies made by White House, Director of the State Department's Far Eastern Affairs, were full of "evasions", giving people the feeling that "the government is not being frank with the committee". Bridges continued in his letter: "The government's sincerity in dealing with China and in dealing with Congress on the China issue is now in doubt. Moreover, the important interests of the American people have been harmed by our government's inaccurate assessment of the post-war situation in the Far East. The government seems to regard the Soviet Union as a 'peace-loving democracy' and the Chinese Communists as merely agrarian reformers, and it has refused to grant export licenses for the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Chinese government for a year, all of which are sufficient to undermine the results of our victory over Japan. Today, the Soviet government is using the Chinese Communists as a tool, threatening to dominate all of China. The war within China has now become a war of bloodshed, starvation, and destruction."</p>
<h3>North China Petition Delegation Continues to Visit Various Ministries; Reports to the Resident Committee of the Senate (Continued from page 1)</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The North China Petition Delegation, a group of five people, continued to negotiate with various agencies on the 22nd. In the morning, they attended the temporary meeting of the Resident Committee of the Senate. Chairman Mo Dehui and the representatives spoke and reported one after another. All the senators expressed deep sympathy and decided to formulate a proposal to be submitted to the central government for careful consideration to improve the social and economic situation in the north. At around 3 p.m., they went to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Because Minister Zuo was in Shanghai, Deputy Minister Zhou Chang presided over the meeting and broadly exchanged views on issues such as northern land reclamation, agricultural and fishing implements, and agricultural loans. It was agreed that large-scale machinery such as tractors and well-drilling machines suitable for the North China Plain should be supplied to the north as much as possible, and the ministry should hand this over to the Land Reclamation Office for handling. As for the agricultural loan issue, it was agreed to discuss with the petition delegation towards the Agricultural Bank and the Four Joint Offices. They visited the Ministry of Social Affairs and were received by Deputy Minister Huang Bodu. Huang said that the Ministry of Social Affairs has always been extremely concerned about the situation in the north. The rice previously handed over by the Executive Headquarters has been decided to distribute 2,000 tons to the north. It has now arrived in Shanghai. It has been decided that Hebei Province will be allocated 700 tons, Tianjin and Beiping 350 tons each, and Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan a total of 600 tons, which are being shipped north in batches. They then visited the Ministry of Water Resources, National Defense, and Health. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by General Manager Shou of the Cooperative Bank. At around 8 p.m., they had a two-hour meeting with Mr. Miao Jiaming and Mr. Bao Shu to discuss in detail the food distribution plan of the UNRRA. The flour among the American grain that has now arrived in Shanghai will be transferred to the north for distribution in Tianjin and Beiping. However, the conversion rate is quite a problem. The Ministry of Food has set the rate at 49 pounds of flour per bag, equivalent to 4 dou of rice. The northern representatives believe that the supply of a small bag of flour is only about 2 dou. The conversion rate is unfair. Mr. Miao and Mr. Bao said they had no preconceived notions and will negotiate with the Ministry of Food again on the 23rd. As for the import and export issue, Committee Member Huo Zhongwei said that since he had just taken office, he would do his best to alleviate the difficulties in the north after he was familiar with the business. The representatives asked him to pay attention to the social and economic background of the north. If exports are not smooth, the countryside will face the danger of being strangled. If the government handles the unified purchase and sale, the price must be reasonable. Otherwise, the tragedy of the people of Hubei and Ezhou in the 33rd year of the Republic of China cutting down tung trees and selling them as firewood may be repeated. On the morning of the 23rd, they will visit the Ministry of Finance. If there are no gains, they will have a lunch hosted by Chief Secretary Wu Tiecheng.</p>

<h3>The First Ambassador to Burma, Tu Yuntan, Arrives in Shanghai; Talks about Promoting Sino-Burmese Relations</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Dr. Tu Yuntan, our country's first ambassador to Burma, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd after paying his respects to Chairman Chiang and asking for instructions.

He said that Burma's independence is undoubtedly the most exciting news for Eastern countries. This move will make the world more deeply understand the trend of Eastern nations striving for independence. Regarding how to promote Sino-Burmese relations, he said that based on our country's consistent good-neighborly and friendly policy, we will first devote ourselves to connecting emotions and increasing understanding so that we can both see each other sincerely. Secondly, we will sign a Sino-Burmese friendship and trade agreement and resolve boundary disputes. He also explained that the biggest purpose of signing a friendship and trade treaty is to protect the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese in operating industry and commerce and to fight for equal treatment for overseas Chinese. Regarding the two pending cases of boundary disputes and the return of overseas Chinese, Mr. Tu said that boundary disputes will be resolved fairly and reasonably through consultation based on treaties and international practices, and the return of overseas Chinese has been largely resolved. Regarding the promotion of overseas Chinese affairs in Burma, he believes that we should promote the unity of overseas Chinese, improve the level of education, and make overseas Chinese abide by Burmese law, give Burmese people a good impression, and fully cooperate with Burmese people economically. He said that our country currently only has a consulate general in Yangon. In order to respond to the needs of the situation, the government is now considering adding a consulate in northern Burma. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Tu suffered from a severe cold and has been delayed for medical treatment. As soon as he recovers, he will leave Shanghai to take up his new post in Burma.</p>

<h3>Britain and France Suggest to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg: Form a West European Security Alliance; British Foreign Secretary Criticizes Soviet Expansionist Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcasting: British Foreign Secretary Bevin warned the House of Commons today that the world is facing "serious danger." He said that the Soviet Union's various statements about Greece are purely fallacious, and accused the Soviet Union of using all its strength to expand its power. The Soviet Union's previous goal was limited to controlling the Communist Party, but now it has expanded to Western Europe. The Soviet Union pointed out that British foreign policy is increasingly close to the United States, and its intention is to do so. Bevin said that British foreign policy has three principles: 1. No country should control Europe; 2. The old concept of balance of power should be broken; 3. European countries should cooperate to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>[Reuters] London, 22nd: Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a two-hour speech at the beginning of the two-day foreign policy debate in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 22nd. The main points are as follows: 1. Western Europe: clarification on the Anglo-American Frankfurt Agreement; 2. European Alliance: Bevin will announce that Britain and France have suggested to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to conclude an alliance to abolish tariff barriers and establish a Western European security system; 3. Important actions that Britain will take in Palestine; 4. Answer to the Soviet Union's criticism of British policy; 5. The Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[British Information Service] London, 22nd: Wartime Prime Minister Churchill attracted the attention of the entire House of Commons when he attended the House of Commons. Anti-Liu Party leader Churchill is in excellent health. When he entered the House of Commons during an inquiry, the questioning member and the respondent both welcomed him. It is expected that Churchill will make an important statement in the foreign policy debate, because he has always advocated that European countries should have close ties.</p>
<p>[Reuters] London, 21st: Diplomatic sources here believe that Britain and France have decided to suggest to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to expand the 50-year treaty of the Anglo-French defensive alliance signed by Britain and France in Dunkirk on March 4, 1947. As for the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, although officials cannot confirm that this proposal has been formally submitted to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, well-informed sources believe that the previous report is reliable. It is reported that Bevin and Pideau will both make important foreign policy speeches in their respective parliaments on the 22nd, when they will mention the expansion of the defensive alliance treaty. The reason why the officials are silent on the previous statement is probably because of this.</p>
<h3>West European Defensive Pact Confronts East European Alliance</h3>
<p>Well-informed sources also believe that the governments of the five countries have already engaged in informal preparatory negotiations to prepare for the expansion of the alliance treaty. When Bevin signed the Anglo-French alliance treaty in Dunkirk last March, he traveled to Moscow to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. When passing through Brussels, he had already discussed the possibility of concluding a similar alliance with the Belgian government. Later, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg established a customs union, and their relationship became closer. Therefore, the expansion of the alliance to the three countries has become a natural development. When studying the importance of this move, diplomats believe that if the five countries establish a defensive alliance, they will strengthen the security of Western European countries that have been invaded by Germany through a long-term defensive treaty. The security needs of France and its smaller northern neighbors can therefore be met. On the other hand, the expansion of the alliance to the five countries is equivalent to the establishment of a "Western European Group" based on military treaty obligations, which is what the Soviet Union fears most. In fact, although the conclusion of the West European defensive pact is officially announced to prevent German aggression, its establishment closely follows the expansion and establishment of the East European alliance network. The latter's officially announced goal is also to prevent German aggression. Furthermore, the Anglo-Soviet Agreement of 1942 and the Anglo-French Agreement of 1944 both have provisions for linking the eastern and western treaty systems, but before the German issue is resolved, the hope of realizing this connection is slim.</p>
<h3>Marshall Discusses Aid to Europe Plan, Believes U.S. Army Department Has Provided Full Cooperation, Latin America Will Still Receive Aid</h3>
<p>[U.S. News] Washington, 21st: Secretary of State Marshall discussed several aspects of the current world situation at a press conference today, including Britain's note on food shortages in the British and American occupation zones of Germany, France's attitude towards economic cooperation in the British and American zones, the situation in Palestine, the role of Latin America in the European recovery plan, and other issues related to the European recovery plan.</p>
<p>This press conference coincided with the one-week anniversary of Marshall's inauguration as Secretary of State. He said that he had only remembered this matter so far. He also jokingly said that he seemed to have been in his current position for a year and a half, rather than just one year. Regarding Germany: Secretary Marshall allowed early consideration of the note from British Foreign Secretary Bevin regarding food shortages in western Germany. The content of the note was not revealed in Washington, but according to unofficial sources, the note expressed concern about the unrest among German workers due to food shortages. Marshall said that the note was still under study and that how to respond had not yet been drafted, but the U.S. government agreed with Bevin's opinion on the seriousness of the food shortage. He said that he was very interested in the suggestions made by Bevin, which were to obtain fish from Scandinavian countries to supplement Germany's diet. When Dulles raised questions on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, he mentioned that the American military occupation authorities had failed to cooperate in the economic recovery of Western Europe. Marshall replied that in his view, the Army Department in Washington and the American military government in Germany had never taken any action that hindered the recovery of Europe. According to Dulles, he suggested to the Senate Committee that if the administrative power was transferred from the Army to the State Department, it would be easier to include western Germany in the European recovery plan. Marshall assured reporters that the Army Department was well aware of the significance of the European recovery plan and had taken a completely cooperative attitude. He pointed out that representatives from the Army Department had participated in the various committees drafting the European recovery plan. Marshall has indicated that the State Department may assume administrative responsibility in July. He said that he had reached an understanding with French Ambassador Bonnet regarding the agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States on the economic control of the British and American occupation zones, and refused to provide further explanation. He also refused to comment on the Syrian military operations in Palestine. He replied to a suggestion made by Palu at the Senate Committee report meeting on Monday to amend the European recovery plan, saying that he had not had time to study it. Although he believed that this suggestion was a natural matter, he said that it was inappropriate to express dissatisfaction that Latin America was not included in the European recovery plan, because according to the European recovery plan, billions of dollars would be used in Latin America, and this would undoubtedly have a good effect.</p>
<p>Hoover Leads Republicans, Will Attack Aid to Europe Plan</p>
<p>[Associated Press] Washington, 22nd: At the urging of former President Hoover, Taft and 20 other Republican leaders met on the 22nd to discuss major issues and amend the Marshall Plan. Hoover had submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a scathing critique of the Marshall Plan. He refuted the government's aid to Europe plan point by point. He suggested that Truman's first-phase Marshall Plan request of 6.8 billion be reduced by 4 billion. It is generally believed that the enemies of the Marshall Plan will immediately gather around the "Hoover Plan" to launch an attack on the government. Taft told an Associated Press reporter: "Hoover's opinion is very correct and coincides with my previous views."</p>
<p>Hoover Opposes Aid to Europe Suggestions, Truman Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 22nd Broadcasting: Washington News, President Truman firmly opposes the suggestions made by former President Hoover on the European recovery plan. The president was unwilling to give reasons, but told reporters that it was very clear that these suggestions could not be applied. However, Mr. Du agreed with the opinions offered by his political senior, Balufu, earlier this week, that the United States should form a defensive alliance with the countries participating in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 22nd Broadcasting: Washington News, Donovan, the former director of the U.S. wartime Strategic Services Bureau, testified on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Soviet Union has launched a global "provocative war" and that the Marshall Plan must be strengthened to deal with it. The Soviet Union has achieved significant success with the help of intentional workers, traitors, and latent enemies, and by exploiting suffering and famine. A formal outbreak of war between the United States and the Soviet Union is not inevitable, but another kind of war is already underway. This war is not being waged by the Red Army, but by the Soviet Communist Party and the fifth column in various parts of the world.</p>

<h3>The Iraqi Government Announces: Non-Ratification of the New Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; Difficulties in Implementing the Palestine Partition Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Baghdad, 22nd] After an hour-long emergency meeting between the Iraqi Regency Council, the speakers and deputy speakers of parliament, and the King, a nationwide broadcast announced that Iraq would not ratify the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty, as it failed to guarantee the country's rights.</p>
<p>Reuters also reports that the Iraqi Regent has telegraphed Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr, who went to Britain to sign the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty, to return to London immediately.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Chenggong Lake, 21st] The British Empire notified the United Nations on the 21st that, for security reasons, Britain must continue to restrict Jewish immigration to Palestine and refuses the United Nations General Assembly's request to open immigration ports. This British plan was proposed by the British representative, Sir Alexander Cadogan. Cadogan stressed that Britain would continue to limit Jewish immigration to the Holy Land to 1,500 people per month until the end of British rule. Therefore, Britain must prevent refugee ships from docking at Tel Aviv before a settlement is reached.</p>
<p>According to a United Press International report, the United Nations Palestine Committee has encountered difficulties from the outset in implementing the Palestine partition plan and has had to report to the Security Council. The committee will report to the Security Council early next week on the various difficulties it is currently facing.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Jerusalem, 21st] Six hundred to seven hundred Arabs attacked the Jewish quarter of Tuham for two days.

<h3>The US State Department Is Ordered to Release the Contents of German Secret Archives: The Soviet Union and Germany Once Discussed Dividing the British Empire</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Today, the State Department, under the order of Secretary of State Marshall, released 260 secret files of Nazi Germany, totaling 362 pages, which were seized by British and American forces. The details of the Soviet Union's constant attempts to collude with Hitler to divide Eastern Europe were completely exposed.</p>
<p>Among them were records of conversations between Hitler, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke. Hitler and Ribbentrop had advised Matsuoka not to negotiate a Soviet-Japanese treaty with the Soviet Union, encouraging Japan to send troops south to attack Singapore. The conversation records contain Ribbentrop's words: "Roosevelt knows that attacking Japan is impossible, so he will not declare war on Japan because the Japanese army attacks Singapore. Japan can take the opportunity to occupy the Philippines, which will severely damage Roosevelt's prestige." Hitler promised that Germany would fight alongside Japan if the United States declared war. The secret files regarding the Soviet Union can be summarized into the following facts: The Soviet Union provided a large amount of support to Germany in its war against the West, providing hundreds of thousands of tons of supplies, constantly seeking Germany's "friendship," and helping Germany to keep Turkey neutral. The Soviet Union and Hitler agreed to exclude the United States and Britain from Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Soviet Union demanded military bases within the Bosporus and the Tatar Strait and that the oil fields from Batumi and Baku south to the Persian Gulf be recognized as Soviet interests. This led to the split between Germany and the Soviet Union and foreshadowed Germany's subsequent invasion of the Soviet Union. The first of these secret files is the official report of the Soviet Union's initial attempt to establish a closer relationship with the Nazis. The Soviet Union prevented its release during the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal's trial of German war criminals. Among them was also the secret pact signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Ribbentrop to divide Poland and delineate the spheres of influence of Germany and the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. The last item relates to Hitler… The State Department said that this attack on Berlin… parts have been copied and presented… This action… with the United States… and made public, is indeed an important diplomatic… One of them, marked "Extremely Urgent, Extremely Secret," was a confidential report from the German ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, dated November 26, 1940, stating that Molotov agreed to sign a four-power (Germany, Italy, Japan) political and economic cooperation treaty, but only if his four conditions were accepted, one of which required Japan to relinquish its rights to the coal and oil fields in northern Sakhalin. Another document is a record of Hitler's conversation with Schulenburg on April 28, 1941, stating: "When Minister Matsuoka visited Moscow, I was there, and I asked the Russians for their opinion on the Soviet-Japanese agreement. I replied that the Russians were very happy, even if they had to take a step back. Stalin told Matsuoka that he had an agreement with the Nazis and had not planned to cooperate with Britain and France."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] German secret archives reveal that Molotov and Hitler discussed dividing the world into German, Soviet, and Japanese spheres of influence and dividing the British Empire.</p>
<p>After the US State Department released these documents, other secret documents of the German Foreign Office obtained by Britain, France, and the United States will be released successively. They are being compiled by one person each from Britain, the United States, and France. When announcing this intention of the British, American, and French governments, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office specifically stated that this action was only to show the historical importance of these documents and had no political implications. He also welcomed the Soviet government to participate in this work.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The chairman of the United Nations delegation to Korea, Menon, stated in a broadcast to all of Korea tonight: "In the upcoming elections, all Korean people will have complete electoral rights, otherwise, the United Nations delegation to Korea will pack up and leave Korea." He said, "We would rather leave than become part of a meaningless, deceptive election."</p>
<p>Observers also said that this principle must apply to both South and North Korea. This delegation does not merely recognize North Korea's intrusion as a political deformity that must be eliminated. From our perspective, Korea is an indivisible whole. He assured the Korean people that after free elections, there would be a withdrawal of all occupation forces within Korea. He said, "Foreign troops, in the best of circumstances, are still a stimulating factor; in the worst of circumstances, they are a threat." He said that the United Nations delegation to Korea has completed its basic preparations for its duties and is now ready to begin dealing with the Korean problem.</p>
<h3>If the Soviet Union Withdraws from North Korea, the United States Has Plans to Respond: Commander of US Forces in Korea Announces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The commander of the US occupation zone in Korea, Hodge, told reporters today that South Korea has been liberated for two and a half years, and although the United States has repeatedly provided assistance to this new and divided country, it is still economically dependent on Japan. General Hodge admitted today that it is impossible to promote economic independence in the southern Korean region alone. Hodge refused to comment on what measures would be taken if Soviet troops withdrew from the north. Recently, people in Seoul said that the US military has no intention of withdrawing abruptly without prior notice, but Hodge stated that the US military has plans to respond to any situation at any time.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Advocates for Stabilizing Western European Currencies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] US Treasury Secretary Snyder, while attending the House Foreign Affairs Committee's review of the European Recovery Program today, presented his views on the program, advocating that European countries participating in the program take swift and vigorous measures to stabilize their currencies. After the European countries have completed these appropriate steps, the United States will provide loans in addition to the aid it intends to give to Europe, to purchase materials under the European Recovery Program. He advocated that the agreement between the United States and each European recipient country stipulate measures to stabilize that country's currency and maintain appropriate exchange rates. He acknowledged that adjusting exchange rates is an extremely complex issue and expects it to be achieved in the process of European recovery.</p>

In addition, it will request $350 million for civilian relief and the prevention of "disease and unrest" in the two regions. The source declined to reveal the exact amount allocated to Japan and Korea but said that 75 percent of it may be transferred to Japan's recovery needs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd, Special Dispatch] According to the Jiji Shinpo, a group of 120 American businessmen is scheduled to come to Japan next month to investigate the possibility of investing in Japanese industry and commerce. The newspaper did not disclose the source of the information. It was also learned from reporters that officials of the Allied General Headquarters are conducting a broad survey of previous foreign investments to provide information for foreign businessmen who will be coming to Japan. The Japanese government is currently making various preparations to receive this group of American businessmen, hoping that they will invest in Japan and assist in Japan's industrial recovery.</p>
<h3>Katayama's Policy Address Is Extremely Vague</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese House of Councillors is scheduled to hold a plenary session at 3:00 PM today (the 22nd). After Prime Minister Katayama's policy speech, Secretary-General Ohno issued a statement saying: "Today's policy speech by Prime Minister Katayama, although covering a wide range of areas such as industry, inflation, and administrative reorganization, is divorced from the current situation and is merely a sermon. Although he spoke of increasing production and revitalizing industry, there were no concrete measures. This is the fatal flaw of his speech, which violates the hopes that the people have for politics and the economy."</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Yosuke Makes False Statements, Huang Xianqian Refutes</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 22nd] Director of the Information Bureau, Dong Xianqian, commenting on the Washington-revealed secret Nazi documents stating that former Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke had "private contact" with President Chiang in 1941, said that President Chiang had not met with Matsuoka Yosuke since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927. Dong said that since the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, President Chiang has never received any Japanese, and Matsuoka's words are false.</p>
<h3>Freedom of the Press Clause Drafted by UN Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 21st] The United Nations Subcommittee on Freedom of the Press today completed drafting the freedom of the press clause to be included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which stated: "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression; this includes freedom from interference in holding opinions and freedom to seek, receive and impart information by any means, regardless of frontiers."</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Franc Devaluation; Britain Opposes Franc Devaluation Measures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Key members of the French cabinet and financial experts convened an emergency meeting tonight. The Governor of the Bank of France, Monick, and experts from the Ministry of Finance attended to discuss the status of the franc. Although no communiqué was issued after the meeting, it is understood that the French government's plan for an indirect devaluation of the franc has been shelved due to the British government's statement that a public market price for the pound and other foreign currencies in Paris would hinder the position of the pound.</p>
<h3>United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information and the Press</h3>
<p>— From Our Newsroom</p>
<p>The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information and the Press is scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on March 23 of this year. The conference is expected to last four or five weeks, depending on the progress of discussions. Each United Nations member state may send five regular representatives, five alternate representatives, and several expert advisors. Representatives will include "persons actually engaged or having extensive experience in newspapers, radio broadcasting, films, and other media for the dissemination of information." The United Nations currently has more than fifty member states, each sending ten regular and alternate representatives, totaling over five hundred people. Non-member states may also send representatives to participate, but they will not have the right to vote. In terms of the professions of the attendees, the conference will undoubtedly be full of talent and very grand.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Pengchun, the representative of our country to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, recognizing the importance of this conference, in addition to reporting to the government for instructions, also convened a symposium in October last year while traveling on the first China National Aviation Corporation flight between China and the United States to the United States, to explain the nature of this conference so that they could bring the message of the conference's mission back to the country and arouse the attention of the press.</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution on December 14, 1946, to convene an international conference on freedom of information. The Economic and Social Council also passed a resolution at its fifth session on August 15, 1947, to proceed with convening the conference. These two resolutions are the basis for the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information. The preparatory work that our country's representatives should do should also take the main text of these two resolutions as a guide. The first resolution contains provisions for freedom of information, conditions for achieving freedom of information, and the personnel that should be present among the representatives of each country. The second resolution contains the organizational methods of the conference, the provisional agenda, the date of the meeting of the Subcommittee on Freedom of Information of the Human Rights Commission, and the submission of a report to the Economic and Social Council, as well as discussions on dealing with the shortage of newsprint. The provisional agenda is very comprehensive, and the principles and issues listed have been carefully reviewed by experts from various countries in the aforementioned Subcommittee on Freedom of Information. When the conference is held in the future, this agenda will be the subject of discussion and debate. At present, what our country's delegation should prepare is everything contained in these two resolutions and the agenda.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Subcommittee on Freedom of Information is the body that planned this conference. On January 19, the subcommittee met to discuss the concept of freedom of information, which is a difficult problem to obtain the agreement of all parties. On February 22, the Economic and Social Council will hold its sixth session. It is still difficult to predict what resolutions will be made at that time. If the Subcommittee has a new report on the concept of freedom of information to offer the Council for discussion, then the Council will have a corresponding resolution, and the content of the resolution may be a subject for research and preparation by the press of various countries. Before the conference is held, we cannot, of course, make affirmative inferences, but it can be asserted that the results of the conference are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>When the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information is held, in accordance with the resolution of the fifth session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council last year, five committees must be established under the plenary session to handle the affairs of the conference. One is the General Committee. The organization of this committee consists of the chairman of the conference, the vice-chairman, and the chairmen of the various committees, and its main task is to submit recommendations on the agenda to the plenary session, issue various draft resolutions to the main committees, and coordinate the work between the committees. In addition to the General Committee, there are four main committees that specialize in the technical aspects of conference affairs. The first committee will discuss the basic tasks of news and other information agencies, the principles of freedom of information, and other general issues shared by the main committees. This committee is responsible for reviewing item 1 of the provisional agenda (general discussion on the principles of freedom of information), item 2 (basic principles that information agencies should pay attention to when collecting, transmitting, and broadcasting information without restrictions), and item 6 (reviewing the drafting of the charter of the rights and obligations of information agencies). The second committee will discuss issues related to the collection of information and international transmission, and its main task is to review item 3 of the provisional agenda (measures to facilitate the collection of information) and item 4 (measures to facilitate the international transmission of information). The third committee will discuss issues related to the free publication and reception of information, review item 5 of the provisional agenda (measures on free publication and reception of information), and item 8 (how to enable other countries to receive information after the establishment of official or semi-official information offices). The fourth committee will discuss legal issues and continuing institutions, and its work is item 6 of the provisional agenda (reviewing the drafting of the charter of the rights and obligations of information agencies), item 7 (reviewing whether a permanent institution can be established to promote the free flow of accurate information), and item 9 (reviewing what action should be taken to make the conference's recommendations most effective, whether to use General Assembly resolutions, international conventions, bilateral agreements, or for countries to formulate appropriate laws themselves, or use other methods), and must also resolve the legal issues submitted by other committees.</p>
<p>Before the representatives of our country leave the country, it is best to prepare a proposal in advance and distribute it to the representatives of various countries before the conference begins. Proposals from other countries can also be obtained in advance, which will facilitate discussions and responses.</p>
<p>The origin, nature, date of the meeting, past discussions, and the agenda for future meetings are introduced below:</p>
<p>Origin of the Conference: According to the Charter of the United Nations, its main organs are the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat. The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information and the Press was decided and approved by the General Assembly on December 14, 1946, and instructed the Economic and Social Council to proceed with convening it.</p>
<p>Nature and Date of the Conference: Freedom of information and the press is one of the basic human rights and is also a major factor in promoting world peace and progress, but at the same time, it is often necessary to avoid abuse, seek facts, and avoid bias in order to create a sound world opinion and seek international understanding and cooperation. Therefore, the purpose of the General Assembly's decision to convene a conference on freedom of information and the press is to formulate opinions on the rights, obligations, and customary practices of the concept of freedom of information; the representatives should be persons actually engaged or having extensive experience in newspapers, broadcasting, films, and other media for the dissemination of information; the date is set for before the end of 1947 and held at a location selected by the Economic and Social Council so that the Council can submit a report to the next regular session of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Subcommittee: Under the Economic and Social Council, there is originally a Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights Commission decided to establish a Subcommittee on Freedom of Information and the Press at its meeting on January 20, 1947. The Subcommittee held its first meeting in Chenggong Lake, New York, from May 19 to June 4 of the same year.</p>
<p>The Process and Recommendations of the First Meeting of the Subcommittee: Zhang Pengchun represented our country at the meeting. The important issues discussed by the committee were: the date of the meeting, it was proposed to postpone it to March and April 1948; the location was proposed to be in Europe, or Prague, Czechoslovakia, or Geneva, Switzerland, or Paris, France, to be chosen by the Council; the number of representatives in each delegation was limited to five regular representatives each. In the organizational meeting, a General Committee and four main committees were set up. At that time, the draft agenda was discussed for the longest time, and the reason was that the governments managed the collection, transmission, and publication of information differently in different countries, and opinions were therefore divergent, causing great debate. The Soviet representative criticized the wording used in the agenda, believing that it violated the tendency of the Charter to protect the internal sovereignty of various countries. At the same time, representatives of other countries also criticized it, believing that the wording was too bland, and that the cancellation or relaxation of information restrictions, as well as the reduction of national interference in individual freedom, could not fully meet the instructions of the Council. Therefore, when the agenda was put to a vote, the request for reservation was made more than once. Second, the concept of so-called freedom of information was reviewed, and representatives from the United States, Norway, Britain, and Czechoslovakia all gave explanations, but there was no discussion. Next, the relationship with the International Telecommunication Union was proposed, and it was proposed that the Secretary-General of the Council be prepared to contact and invite it to participate. Later, the shortage of newsprint was discussed.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Council: The Economic and Social Council, based on the report of the Subcommittee, met on August 15, 1947, to discuss and amend its recommendations and established the following resolutions:</p>
<p>Date and Location of the Meeting: Changed to March 23, 1948, in Geneva.</p>
<p>Provisions for Voting Rights: The exercise of voting rights is limited to member states of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Non-Member States Invited to Participate: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, Transjordan, Yemen. (Note: This is a resolution from August 15 of last year. Some of them may have joined as members now.)</p>
<p>Specialized Agencies, Intergovernmental Organizations, and Non-Governmental Organizations Invited to Attend:</p>
<p>Specialized agencies that have concluded agreements with the United Nations are: the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the International Civil Aviation Organization.</p>
<p>Intergovernmental organizations that will conclude agreements with the United Nations are: The International Bank for Reconstruction, and the Development of the International Monetary Fund, the International Refugee Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the International Trade Organization, the Universal Postal Union, and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Category A Non-Governmental Organizations are: The American Federation of Labor, the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Cooperative Alliance, the International Federation of Agricultural Producers, the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and the World Federation of Trade Unions.

<h3>First Batch of Reparations Materials Arrives: Grand Reception Ceremony Held; Zhang Huabang Wharf Decorated with County Flags and Colorful Ribbons; Excitement and Enthusiasm; More Than Four Hundred Pieces Are Machine Tools and Other Machinery</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Hae Kang, transporting 453 pieces of Japanese reparations machinery back to the country, entered the Wusongkou at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday and docked at Zhang Huabang Wharf at 8:30 AM. A reception ceremony was held at the wharf at 10:30 AM. Attendees included Qin Fen and Hu Shiyuan from the Supervisory Committee for Reparations Materials, Ouyang Lun from the Ministry of Economic Affairs representing the receiving agency, Jiang Yijun from the Resources Committee, Li Weicheng from the Ministry of National Defense, Zhang Yuanlun from the Ministry of Communications, Wang Zhiche from the Ministry of Education, and guests Xu Xueyu, Zhang Xuesui, and Chen Yuzhen, totaling several hundred people. Zhang Huabang Wharf was decorated with flags and colorful ribbons, and several red and green arches were built, creating an atmosphere of excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Commencement of National Reconstruction and Revival: Hopes for Wise Utilization</h3>
<p>The ceremony commenced amidst firecrackers and music. Chairman Qin Fen began with a speech, stating: In the past, defeated nations compensated victorious nations with money. However, the experience of the First World War proved that this method only made it impossible for defeated nations to bear the burden, leading to another war. Therefore, the United Nations decided to adopt a more reasonable approach, compensating in a way that does not hinder the basic living needs of the defeated nation's people. Japan first extracted a portion of its military industrial equipment for reparations, half of which was allocated to our country, while the other half was divided among the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Today, as we receive the first batch of machinery, it marks the beginning of our national reconstruction and revival. It is hoped that the government and the people will work together to utilize it well for construction. Regarding the distribution method, some advocated that it should all be compensated to factories in the rear areas. However, the government believes that the entire nation suffered losses during the war of resistance, so everyone should have the right to enjoy compensation. Therefore, a portion will be allocated to state institutions, and a quarter will be transferred to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for resale to private factories. Compensation for civilian losses will be distributed after the machinery is appraised.</p>
<p>Justice Finally Triumphs over Might</p>
<p>Guests Xue Sui and Xu Xueyu delivered speeches one after another, both believing that obtaining compensation in materials was not easy. They hoped that all receiving agencies would avoid waste and properly utilize it for reconstruction and revival.</p>
<p>Yu Runsheng, Director of the Ministry of National Defense, representing the receiving agencies, expressed his delight and gratitude for the cooperation of all sectors. He also believed that our country's acquisition of Japanese reparations demonstrated that justice would inevitably triumph over might. After the speeches, the entire group took a commemorative photo and toured the Shanghai Wheel. This historic ceremony was successfully completed.</p>
<p>Two Ships Participate in Loading Materials</p>
<p>According to reports, our country received over nine thousand seven hundred pieces of reparations materials. Yesterday, the Haikang transported four hundred and fifty-three pieces, all of which were lathes, drilling machines, iron beds, and other machinery. Each piece varied in size, weighing between two and eight tons. The Haikang completed loading in Yokosuka in three days and nights. At the same time, the ship brought to Shanghai three overseas Chinese and one family member of a member of the delegation stationed in Japan. It is expected that all the materials will be unloaded by the afternoon of the 23rd.</p>
<p>It is reported that in the future, in addition to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Xingshu Shipping Company and the Yixiang Shipping Company will also dispatch ships to Japan to transport reparations materials. The Yongxing of the Zhongxing Company is scheduled to depart for Yokosuka on February 3rd, with a capacity of four thousand cubic feet. The Limin of the Yixiang Company is scheduled to depart for Sendai on February 4th, with a capacity of three thousand cubic feet.</p>

Laborers from other trucking companies in Hongkou believed that adjustments could only be made after Changxing increased wages, so they gathered over a hundred people at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to petition. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that without a representative from the employer, mediation was impossible and scheduled a meeting for negotiations. The petitioning laborers left at around 7 p.m.</p>

<h3>Mees Speer Case Opens for Third Trial; American and Dutch Diplomats Attend Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The case of Mees Speer, a Dutchman and manager of Ebbes Company, for illegally operating in the black market for foreign exchange, was previously sentenced to one year in prison by the High Court in the second instance. Mees appealed, and the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial. The third trial began yesterday, and was heard by President Yi Dingzhi of the High Court at around 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Mees Speer appeared in court to be questioned. Mees's defenders, lawyers Chen Tingrui and Cai Runian, Deputy Consul Tuole of the US Consulate General in Shanghai, Dutch Consul General Midobur, and Zhang Tianyin, legal advisor to the US Consulate, attended the hearing. Witnesses Shi Jiusen, Shao Shunqing, Babotes Taissitai, Baotana, Kang Paike, and accountant Xie Chunpu, all employees of Ebbes Company, testified. The Supreme Court sent back the case for retrial because it was necessary to investigate whether the US$40,000 and HK$20,000 in the account books were foreign exchange margin or black market foreign exchange. The US dollars seized were US$2,110 more than recorded in the account books. Xie, the accountant, testified that the US$40,000 and HK$20,000 were indeed margin. As for the US$2,110, it was impossible to examine because it was not entered in the account books. Mees Speer stated that the money was loose change from the US$300,000 in inventory, kept outside for use, and was not for sale. The court found that in the accountant's examination of the accounts, US$57,860 had been sold by Ebbes Company, which accountant Xie confirmed. Mees Speer also admitted this without hesitation. After the witnesses testified, lawyers Chen and Cai stood up to defend him. The hearing concluded at around 5 p.m., and Mees was released on bail, with a retrial scheduled.</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus Dispute at Dayouyu Leads to Arrests, Arousing Public Outrage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Five or sixty workers at the Dayouyu Oil Pressing Factory at No. 2, Lane 50, Yichang Road, had a dispute over year-end bonuses. Sun Meisheng, chairman of the labor union, negotiated with the employer for many days without any progress. The night before, Sun was questioned by four workers who mistakenly thought he was colluding with the factory, and they beat him. Afterwards, Sun reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Sub-bureau, and pointed out the surnames of the four assailants. The police dispatched officers to arrest the suspects, Liu Meiyuan and Zhang Demei. Zhu Shubing and Fa Kun fled. Unexpectedly, this aroused the public outrage of all the workers. At around 11 a.m. yesterday, about sixty people gathered to storm the sub-bureau to inquire about the reason for the arrest. Fortunately, the bureau had received a report, and quickly escorted Liu and others to the District Prosecutor's Office, and telephoned the General Bureau to dispatch red police vehicles for suppression, preventing any incidents from occurring.</p>
<h3>Post Office to Hold Daily Broadcasts</h3>

New Postal Facilities, 2. Postal Delivery Daily Report, 3. Postal Knowledge, and 4. Postal News.

<h3>City Allotted 6,000 Conscription Quota for 1948; Conscription Methods to Be Changed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] A responsible military service authority revealed yesterday that the Ministry of National Defense has allocated a conscription quota of 6,000 for the city in 1948. Military service authorities at all levels in the city will convene a military service conference to discuss conscription methods. He also said: It is currently unknown whether volunteers will be recruited this year, but for various reasons, it is believed that the conscription method this year will be different from last year, at least the conscription method will be changed.</p>
<h3>Price Increase for Two Railway Tickets Imminent; Yu Dawei Says It Will Be Implemented in Short Term</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Regarding rumors of a price increase for tickets on the two railways, the reporter asked Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei on the evening of the 22nd. He said that since the adjustment of wages and the increase in coal prices, the expenses of the two railway bureaus have increased by 60 billion yuan per month, so adjusting prices is inevitable. Yu did not reveal the percentage and proportion of the price increase, but only said that it would be implemented in the short term.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Convenes Meeting of Power Plants; Power Generation Not to Be Reduced; Install Capacitors for Neon Lights</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Public Utilities Bureau convened a meeting of representatives of various power companies yesterday, and passed three important resolutions: 1. The coal shortage is serious. Starting next month, the amount of coal allocated to each power company will be allocated according to the limit. However, the power generation of each company must not be reduced. 2. The electricity saving measures passed by the Senate have only saved more than 10,000 kilowatts since implementation, which is far from the expected target of saving 20,000 kilowatts, so the electricity saving measures should be strengthened. 3. Users of fluorescent lamps and neon lights will be forced to install capacitors, because installing capacitors can reduce power consumption by half.</p>
<p>Family Settlement Fees Borrowed and Not Yet Returned</p>
<p>He believed that the results of handling the preferential treatment funds for strong young men last year were unsatisfactory. As of now, less than 10 billion yuan has been received for preferential treatment funds for strong young men exempted from conscription, because two-thirds of the strong young men who applied for exemption have been approved, and 8 billion yuan still needs to be returned. Only 1 billion yuan has been received for preferential treatment funds for households without strong young men going to war. As for the originally planned donation of 20 billion yuan from wealthy merchants, only 2 billion yuan has been received so far, which is far from the target. As a result, more than 10 billion yuan in settlement fees borrowed from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus by the Military Service Association has not yet been repaid, and the amount of interest payable is also considerable.</p>
<p>Compiling Report on Collecting Preferential Treatment Funds</p>
<p>The Military Service Association previously dispatched personnel to various districts to urge the collection of preferential treatment funds for strong young men exempted from conscription and for households without strong young men going to war, together with the Shanghai National Guard District. Each stage of the work has been completed, and detailed reports on the collection situation and achievements in each district have been prepared and sent to the Association. The Association will forward them to the Municipal Government, and award or punish them separately according to the merits of the collection.</p>
<h3>Green Handbag Hides Face; Bright Red Nails Stained with Oil; "Foreign Girl" Regains Freedom; Shen Gongzang Detained for Robbery</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The scandals between "Foreign Girl" Li Zhen, a red dancer, and Shen Gongwei have been endless. Recently, Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, twisted her to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Sub-bureau on charges of adultery. They were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation at around 11 a.m. yesterday. Shen is married to Mao Xiuzhen and has two children, one two years old and one still in swaddling clothes. However, Shen does not work and likes to wander around. He lives with Li at No. 4, Lane 1112, Yuyuan Road. Although the two often quarrel, they soon reconcile. At around 11 p.m. on the 20th of this month, after Shen and Li finished dancing, Shen invited Li to a drinking establishment. Li drank too much, so Shen took Li back to Shen's residence at No. 549, North Shaanxi Road in the same car, and went to sleep in Shen's father's bedroom. The matter was discovered by Mao, who reported it to the Judicial Section of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Sub-bureau for investigation. On the suspicion that Shen and Li were committing adultery, they were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. Li was wearing a blue silk cheongsam with white polka dots, a leopard-skin fur-lined coat, nylon stockings, and brown leather shoes. Because the reporter was taking pictures, she covered her face with a dark green leather handbag. Shen was wearing a navy blue melton overcoat, suit pants, and black leather shoes. After the two were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office, they were immediately locked in a "small prison." More than twenty thieves already occupying the area were surprised to see this modern couple arrive. Then, they were taken out to fingerprint. Her red fingernails were covered with oil stains. Li was deeply affected and sobbed. Shen Gongwei remained calm and wiped the ink off his hands with a rag and handed the rag to Li to wipe herself. Fang Zheng, the prosecutor, opened the court at 3 p.m. According to Li, she once had a relationship with Shen and denied cohabitation. On the night of the 20th, Shen got her drunk with wine, saying they were going to a club, but unexpectedly sent her to Shen's home. Because she was drunk, she was not conscious, and had no choice but to let him do as he pleased, so the responsibility should be borne by Shen Gongwei. As a dancer, she has to be perfunctory to guests, and she does not intend to harm Shen's family. Shen said that he has known Li for several years, and they have been living together for a year. They are usually very affectionate, but he often quarrels with his wife because they have different personalities, so Mao took the opportunity to frame him. The court investigated and found an unlicensed No. 3 revolver and nine bullets at Shen's house. When asked why he kept the gun, Shen replied that he bought it for fun, with no other purpose. The court believed that Shen's possession of firearms was a serious matter, and ordered that he be detained. He was ordered to pay 20 million yuan in cash bail, and the court will be held on the 24th of this month for investigation.</p>

<h3>Floating Palace Arrives from America: A Tour of the President Cleveland; Warm and Spring-Like Decoration is Luxurious and Beautiful; Over Sixty Kinds of Dishes for One Dinner</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] The largest and most luxurious passenger ship on the American Pacific route, the President Cleveland, arrived in Shanghai on her maiden voyage yesterday. This "floating grand hotel" attracted hundreds of Chinese and foreign women to visit and made them reluctant to leave. There are indeed reasons why it is worth lingering.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the milky-white Cleveland, you immediately get the impression of "a beautiful and luxurious grand hotel," warm and spring-like. To the right is an elevator, and on both sides are staircases with gold iron railings. To the left is the information desk and the business office. Sofas line the walls. Flowers and antiques are displayed in glass cabinets on the walls. It is very beautiful. Upstairs are the dining room, cabins, lounges, etc.</p>
<h3>Fish, Shrimp, Oysters, and Capons from All Over the World</h3>
<p>The ship can carry a total of 552 passengers, 330 in first class and 222 in third class. There is no second class. The enjoyment of first-class passengers can be said to be unsurpassed even by the largest hotels in China or even the Far East. The dining room has two large rooms, one called the "California" Hall and the other the "Marco Polo" Hall. Their dishes can be described as delicacies from land and sea. Just the menu is exquisite and colorful, and it is changed every meal, printed on board. Looking at yesterday's dinner menu, including cold dishes, soups, meats, vegetables, and desserts, there are more than sixty kinds in total. You can choose whatever you want, or even order everything, as long as you can eat it. Among them are Alaskan fish, Hong Kong shrimp, Californian vegetables, and eastern American oysters. You can eat as much seasonal fresh fruit as you want, all included in the fare. There is also a "Seascape Observation Room" where you can eat snacks, dance, and watch movies. These kinds of entertainment are also available in third class.</p>
<h3>Banquets in Neptune's Hall; Children Have Their Own Paradise</h3>
<p>There is another room in first class called "Neptune's Hall," which is specially for passengers to host private banquets. The small room is very elegantly decorated and has a bar. There are also several lounges, living rooms, and bars. As for the interior equipment, it is all American latest-style, largest, most beautiful and generous furniture. The soft lighting is matched with elegant murals, thick velvet carpets, and large, thick, and clear glass doors. The tables are all heatproof and waterproof, and cigarette butts leave no marks on them. Although the bedrooms are smaller, they are fully equipped. The suites are particularly elegant, including a bedroom (with three beds), a bathroom, and a quiet little living room with a sea view. The mattresses are foam rubber, not spring mattresses.</p>
<p>The ship also has a gym and a swimming pool. There is also a "Children's Paradise," with radios, small ships, small wooden houses and various toys, and even small washrooms. Children can play there from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The ship has radar, radio, and safety equipment installed to the best of its ability. Especially special is that automatic fire doors are installed everywhere. If a fire breaks out, a button on the door will close immediately upon heating, isolating the fire. Otherwise, it cannot be closed. In addition, passengers can walk around everywhere on the ship's deck, forming a circle, unlike some other ships where the two sides are cut off.</p>
<h3>Unprecedentedly Expensive Tickets; Three Thousand Seven Hundred US Dollars</h3>
<p>"You get what you pay for." It is conceivable that the Cleveland's tickets are expensive. The round-trip first-class ticket costs US$3,750, and the third-class round-trip is US$1,250. Starting in February (i.e., next time), it will increase by 25%. The third class fare from Shanghai to San Francisco will be US$630. Not counting the fare, the ship's expenses are also considerable. Under normal circumstances, drinking wine also requires a 25% tip.</p>
<p>The Cleveland was built by the California Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, costing US$21.5 million and taking three and a half years to complete. The ship is 609 feet 5 and three-quarters inches long. From the bottom deck to the highest point, there are eight decks high. The gross tonnage is 23,507 tons, and the net tonnage is 10,548 tons. Normally, it travels 19 knots per hour, and the maximum speed is 21 knots per hour. In addition to 552 passengers, there are 350 crew members, including a small number of Chinese, but they are all naturalized American citizens, because American maritime regulations require American ships to use American crew members.</p>
<p>Each round trip takes 39 days. Each route goes alternately clockwise and counterclockwise. This time, it departed from San Francisco, passing through Hong Kong, Yokohama, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, Honolulu, and returning to San Francisco. Next time, it will depart from San Francisco, passing through Honolulu, Yokohama, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, and Honolulu, returning to San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and Others Appreciated It</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Wu and his wife, Vice President Sun and his wife, Director Chen Guolian of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, and foreign guests who came to visit and attend the cocktail party all praised the ship. Mayor Wu and his wife were particularly interested and were accompanied by the ship's person in charge to visit everywhere. This afternoon from 3 to 6 p.m., the ship will again invite people from all walks of life in China to board the ship for a tour.</p>
<p>(Also reported) Following the Cleveland, another similar sister ship of the British President Lines, the President Wilson, will set sail to China on April 15.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Election Voting: Today is the Last Day; Competition and Promotion Gradually Calm Down</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the second day of the Legislative Yuan election. Although there was light rain in the afternoon, voter turnout was more enthusiastic than the previous day. It is estimated that the number of voters yesterday exceeded 300,000, and today, as the last day, will see even more enthusiasm. It is predicted that the total number of votes cast in this Legislative Yuan election will be around one million, similar to the National Assembly election.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local Legislative Yuan election entered the final, intense stage. The need for promotion has decreased, so the promotional vehicles on the streets were not as active as on the first day. In terms of the actual voting situation, Yan Huiqing himself did very little campaigning, and his votes were scattered across all districts, each accounting for a considerable proportion. All staff members of the Shanghai Municipal Government also voted for Yan. The votes for Fang Zhichao and Wang Xinheng were also scattered across all districts, each holding a significant advantage. Ma Shuli and Ma Junshuo also received a lot of help from fellow Jiangsu northerners. Ma received quite a few votes in each district. Songshan District is the most densely populated area of the city, and Zhu Wende's votes occupied the dominant position. Among the female candidates, Zheng Yuxiu spared no effort in both public and secret campaigning. To give a concrete example, the cloth banner and purple lanterns she hung at the entrance of the International Hotel cost as much as 20 million yuan in advertising fees, and other expenses can be imagined. Because the main candidates were evenly matched, according to observations by qualified individuals, the difference in votes between the winners will be no more than 5,000 to 10,000 votes.</p>
<p>North District Polling Station Dispute: Thugs Handed Over to the Police Station</p>
<p>Yesterday, the order at each polling station in the district election was generally good. However, at around 3:00 PM yesterday at the polling station in the North Railway Station Central National School, a serious dispute occurred between voters Xie Renjian and Cao Shi. Zhang Jun and Mao Pingshao, staff members of a certain department, were beaten and sent to Haining Road Hospital. The thugs were apprehended on the spot and handed over to the police station, and an unlicensed pistol was found on them. Upon hearing the news, Xie Renjian immediately went to see Mayor Wu, requesting that the thugs be detained and prosecuted. Also, at Hongqiao Elementary School in Xujiahui District, there was a minor dispute at around 3:00 PM yesterday, but it was not serious in nature and was resolved after mediation. At around 5:00 PM, Xie Renjian visited Zhang Xiaosong at the election office again, detailing the beating at the North Railway Station, and shared his thoughts on the Legislative Yuan election with reporters. He stated: "The police often interfere with voting, preventing the spirit of democracy from being fully implemented. In terms of campaign expenses, apart from Yan Huiqing and Zhou Yizhi, most people are wasting money. I have already spent 500 to 600 million, not to mention others."</p>
<p>Alternative Measures for Those Who Have Not Received Identification Cards</p>
<p>The election office has decided on alternative measures for voters who have not received their national identification cards. Voters can bring the receipt for their application for an identification card to the polling station to receive a ballot. After receiving the ballot, the polling station manager will stamp the original receipt to indicate that it has been used.</p>
<p>Technician Voting to be Extended: Most Capital Election Commissions to Act</p>
<p>Voting at the polling stations for the Legislative Yuan election by professional groups was even more enthusiastic than before. The ballots for the technician group were only issued from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning, and the election began at 3:00 PM in the afternoon at the Central Park. Technicians from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau in the city all voted for Zeng Yangfu yesterday. Renowned technicians Yu Zonghuai and Guo Taimo also voted for Zeng. The deadline for the group's election is scheduled for 6:00 PM today. If there is not enough time, the election office will submit a request to the chief supervisor for an extension. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Zhao Kang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, will vote at the polling station today as technicians. Their voting target is also Zeng Yangfu. In addition to the technician group, all other professional group elections will officially end at noon today.</p>
<p>The medical and pharmaceutical group election was held at the Zhongde Hospital this time, combining the physicians, dentists, pharmacists, pharmacy assistants, and midwives associations. The venue was decorated grandly and cleanly, making it the best of all the polling stations in the city. A large-scale information desk was set up at the entrance. The voting area was newly equipped with twelve train-style single seats, each separated from the other, and each with a wall lamp and white cloth, complementing the fragrant flowers and plants, creating a quiet and solemn atmosphere. This arrangement was designed by Dr. Wang Jinrong of the Physicians Association and cost a significant amount of money. The directors of major hospitals in the city went to the venue to vote yesterday, and the number of votes for Yu Songyun, Pang Jingzhou, and Su Zengxiang (female) was relatively high.</p>
<p>Police Officer at Union Polling Station Disarmed by Workers</p>
<p>At the No. 1 polling station of the Dakang Workshop in Yangshupu, when a large group of workers went to vote yesterday, a conflict arose because the guarding police officer asked to see their election certificates. The workers believed that the police were interfering with their right to vote. The police officer fired a shot into the air, arousing public anger. The workers surrounded and disarmed the officer. The police officer was beaten and injured. The relevant authorities were notified by telephone from the polling station to send personnel to the scene to suppress the situation, and order was quickly restored.</p>
<p>Midwife Jokes: Hands That Deliver Babies Now Vote</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the voter turnout for commercial and labor union groups has exceeded more than half. Because the physicians association held its election separately from the medical and pharmaceutical groups this time, and there was only one candidate, the situation was relatively calm. Xi Wangshi received the most votes in the accountants association, and voting there is almost complete. When the midwives collected their election certificates yesterday, most did not have seals, so they all used fingerprints instead. One lady joked: "Hands that just delivered babies are now being used to vote!"</p>
<h3>Journalism Industry Asks to Investigate the Identity of National Assembly Candidate Yang Junming</h3>
<p>Reporters' Voting Completed Smoothly</p>
<p>The election for the journalism industry group was held at the Lake Society yesterday. Staff from various newspapers in the city rushed to the venue to vote from 8:00 AM, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also visited the venue yesterday. All voting was completed by 3:00 PM, and Chen Xun and Cheng Cangbo received the most votes.</p>
<p>The list of elected National Assembly representatives will be announced by the central government after the Legislative Yuan election is completed. More than 100 members of the city's reporters association, including Yan Fuzhou and Hu Ruchu, stated that the candidates for the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan elections from the reporters group were all well-known figures in the journalism industry, engaged in journalistic work for more than ten years and deeply supported by their peers. However, the election regulations stipulate that voters and candidates from professional groups must be basic members of their respective groups, and the membership roster must be submitted 60 days before the election. The question arises regarding National Assembly candidate Yang Junming: Which reporters association is he a member of, and what kind of news work is he currently engaged in? Since he has no contact with his colleagues, it is difficult to understand. There are fears that if he is elected, Article 39 of the Dismissal Law, which deals with qualification, might be violated, causing multiple disputes. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the National Professional Women's Election Office, requesting an investigation into Yang Junming's identity as a reporter to determine whether he meets the qualifications for a candidate. They hope for an early announcement to dispel doubts. It is also said that colleagues from Jiangsu and Zhejiang gathered in Shanghai yesterday to discuss expanding this investigation.</p>

<h3>Corruption Scandal at Guiyang School Over Food Salt: Principal's Scheme to Purchase Inferior Goods Exposed; Staff Refuse to Resign, Preferring Collective Downfall</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guiyang, 19th] National Guiyang Normal College is one of only three higher education institutions in Guizhou Province. Recently, a case of illegally purchasing food salt for private gain and defiling the reputation of the college authorities has come to light. After being discovered by the college's professors' association and student union, they organized a "Committee to Investigate the Food Salt Corruption Case by All Students" and sent representatives to the Guizhou Salt Bureau to review correspondence between the college and the bureau. After confirming the illicit purchase, they widely published emergency notices in Guiyang newspapers to report on the thorough investigation and reveal the truth. This action greatly angered Principal Zeng Jinghan, who asked the newspapers "not to publish" the information, leading the students to petition the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Gang, and the Supervising Commissioner stationed in Guiyang, He Chaozong. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. A detailed report on the incident is as follows:</p>
<p>The college currently has a total of no more than 1,000 teachers, staff, students, workers, and their families, including those at the affiliated middle and elementary schools.</p>
<p>The students' food salt has always been purchased monthly by the college sending a letter to each session's dining committee, which was responsible for purchasing the salt directly from the Guizhou Salt Bureau at the official price, without any problems. However, in the past two months, rumors suddenly spread that someone at the college was creating a roster to purchase food salt illicitly, causing difficulties for the dining committee each time they tried to purchase salt. Representatives from the professors' association and the student union secretly conducted an investigation but found no results. To solve the case as soon as possible, the college's student union joined with the education, Chinese, history and geography, English, physics and chemistry, mathematics, and physical education societies to organize a "Committee to Investigate the Food Salt Corruption Case by All Students." They conducted separate investigations inside and outside the college and sent representatives to the Guizhou Salt Bureau for inquiries. According to an emergency notice sent to various newspapers jointly signed and sealed by the student union and various societies: "Entrusted by all students, our committee went to the Guizhou Salt Bureau at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month for inquiries. According to Mr. Jin Shiquan, a section chief in charge, the bureau received a letter from your college dated November 20, 1947, with serial number 752, stating that the college had a total of 3,158 faculty, staff, students, and their families, and requested to purchase 1,000 dan of food salt. Former Director Zhang Dexiang reviewed the request and considered the number of food salt requested to be too large, so he reduced it to 24 dan, which was personally collected by Mr. Zhu Bin, an employee sent by your college. After speaking, he also produced relevant correspondence and the application roster for verification. After detailed review and comparison by the representatives of our committee, all the details matched what Section Chief Jin Shiquan said." The truth about the illicit purchase was thus revealed. All the faculty, staff, and students of the college, as well as the Guiyang press, believe that while such bad phenomena are common and unsurprising when they involve corrupt officials or unscrupulous merchants, it is appalling that such scandalous behavior should occur in a higher education institution that cultivates teachers for secondary education. Reporters from various newspapers, after extensive investigation, have obtained clues about the entire case. Zeng Jinghan, the college principal, is from Jiangxi and is 38 years old this year. After taking office in the first half of last year, he repeatedly encountered disturbances due to not meeting public expectations. Therefore, he has been hiring fellow Jiangxi natives as much as possible to facilitate his operations. His various misdeeds have long been reported to the Ministry of Education by students, and the ministry has sent inspectors to conduct special investigations. This time, the illicit purchase of food salt was carried out by Li Ge, a member of the document section, under the alias Zhu Bin.</p>
<p>He personally carried a roster listing 3,158 faculty, staff, students, and their families, requesting to purchase 1,000 dan of food salt. He went to the Guizhou Salt Bureau and purchased the salt at the official price of over 40,000 yuan per dan. The Salt Bureau, seeing the college's official seal and the principal's official stamp, did not suspect anything and only thought the number was too large, reducing it to 24 dan per month, each dan being 100 jin. In November, the market price had risen to over 140,000 yuan, meaning each dan could generate over 100,000 yuan in profit. If the request to purchase 1,000 dan had been approved, the profit would have been staggering! After Li Ge obtained the food salt, he sold all of it to the Jianye Trading Company, which was opened by Principal Zeng Jing's fellow villagers. It is said that the profits were submitted by Li Ge to Zuo Zhiying, the head of the document section and a relative of the principal, for distribution. Now that the investigation is complete and the truth is revealed, Principal Zeng has taken emergency measures, recording</p>
<p>a major demerit against Zuo Zhiying, the head of the document section, and hinting to Li Ge to resign and leave as soon as possible. However, Li Ge insists that this was not his own doing and, now that everyone is in the water, insists on dragging everyone down together. He told people that he would not resign voluntarily and would rather go to court and face a lawsuit than take the blame alone. Since the news could not be published in Guiyang newspapers, the students changed their approach and posted advertisements, but the college sent a letter to the newspapers asking them not to publish the advertisements. They had no choice but to submit a written petition to the Provincial Assembly and the Supervising Commissioner stationed in Guiyang. It is said that they will submit all relevant documents to the court for prosecution within days and will make a full presentation when Tang Xifen, the inspector sent by the Ministry of Education, arrives in Guiyang, hoping for fair treatment. The college has been trying to find intermediaries to mediate the situation. It remains to be seen whether things will be peaceful in the future. (Special Correspondent Liu Mengchi)</p>

<h3>Nanchang Corpse: Throat Strangled, Fingerprints Visible</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanchang, 19th] A case of a beautiful corpse was discovered yesterday (18th) near the Dunzitang area on Huanhu Road, near the bamboo fence of Rui Garden. The identity of the deceased is that of a lonely young woman. In her childhood, she fled to Ji'an during the war. After her mother died of illness, she was taken in by Wang, who enrolled her in singing classes. In June of last year, she met a leather craftsman, Zhao Yuxiang. In July, Zhao married her for 500,000 yuan. However, Zhao was a craftsman who made a living with his hands, so his family circumstances were naturally not very wealthy. Moreover, at a time when rice was expensive, Zhao also liked to drink and gamble. Therefore, Zhao's mother was willing to sell her for double the price. The deceased, Wang Juying, learned of this and discussed it with her foster father, Wang, asking him to raise 1.2 million yuan to escape. However, due to financial difficulties, she entered the world of prostitution and worked as a prostitute in Zhu Wanyun's establishment. She met Xiao Libi, an employee of the Central Bank. However, her ex-husband, Zhao Yuxiang, after breaking off relations with the deceased, would encounter her on the street and become entangled, but he did not dare to re-enter her life. At about 9:00 PM yesterday, the deceased was still playing mahjong with her sisters in the brothel when a man wearing ragged clothes came to find her. The deceased asked where Fatty (referring to Xiao Libi) was. The man replied, "Outside." The deceased then went out with him and did not return all night. A woman of only nineteen years old was murdered in the wilderness under the fence in the quiet of the night. The fatal injury to the deceased was in her throat, with visible fingerprints, indicating strangulation. There was a one-inch scar on her lower abdomen, and her back was completely purple. Five or six steps away from the corpse, there were two spots of blood. The blood stains on the support of a new house resembled a man's bloody palm print. According to general judgment, the deceased and the murderer had a grudge. The murderer intended to stab her with a knife, but during the struggle, he strangled her to death, moved the body here, and took off the leather coat she was wearing. It was truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Wu County Collects More Than Half of All Grain Taxes</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 22nd] As of today, Wu County has collected over 282,000 dan of field tax for 1947, accounting for approximately 54% of the total tax amount. County Magistrate Wang Jiefu stated that he would continue his efforts and would be able to collect 80% by the end of the lunar year, making the future of tax administration still optimistic.</p>
<h3>Fierce Tigers Disrupt Security in Fujian: Senators Call for Encirclement and Suppression</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 18th] In Yong'an, Datian, Youxi, and Shunchang counties of Fujian Province, tiger attacks are occurring frequently, and residents being devoured by tigers are common. According to reports, in the areas bordering Yong'an and Youxi alone, hundreds of people were taken away by tigers last year. The villagers lack sophisticated weapons and are helpless. During the Provincial Assembly session, when the police and security departments responded to inquiries, Senators Zheng Ziming, You Xingrong, and Jiang Chao loudly exclaimed, "Have the police and security departments seen that fierce tigers are disrupting security?" They added, "Where the tiger plagues exist, not only are the people's bodies unsafe, but the local forests are also damaged." They suggested, "The Army University does not have a tiger hunting course. The Fujian Provincial Police and Security Department should specially study how to train their subordinates to hunt tigers in the future." Yan Yuanyuan, the director of the department, nodded in response, saying that he could ask the local authorities to find capable individuals to organize group suppressions, and the department would provide firearms and ammunition as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Mount Baxian in the Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taipei, 18th] To use women as a metaphor for Taiwan's forestry, Mount Ali can be said to be a "beauty nearing twilight," while Mount Baxian is still in its "prime of youth." Mount Ali has been logged for thirty-seven years, and if the twenty-year development plan for the Nanzi Xian River is not actively implemented, it will only have two or three years left. Mount Baxian, although it also has a thirty-two-year history, can continue for about twenty-three years due to its vast area, including the left and right banks of the Datian River and the upper reaches of the Da'an River and the Beixiao River. In the future, further development of the Greater and Lesser Snow Mountains, which contain nearly 35 million stone of timber, will extend the logging for another seventy years. The surging Datian River was once planned by the Japanese for a Dajian power plant that would have been the third largest in the world; it also fertilized the rice in this basin, making it the best variety in Taiwan; now, it is nurturing a vast forest that George Naun, a forestry expert who has traveled the world for thirty years, marveled at as the best in the world. This time, he and Tang Zhenxu, Director of the Forest Products Administration, inspected the three forest areas of Mount Ali, Mount Baxian, and Mount Taiping throughout the province, and reporters heard many valuable opinions from them along the way.</p>
<p>Luxurious Screens in New York Hotels</p>
<p>Taiwan has the most precious timber in the world, but according to George Naun, it is being wasted in Taiwan. The screens in the most luxurious hotels in New York are being used here as railroad ties, piano frames, Buddha statues, and even oars for rowboats. It is found everywhere in windows and doors, and even in wooden railings. He wonders why they don't take the timber, which costs four U.S. dollars per foot, to his country—Australia—where they can exchange a small number of conifers for a large number of hardwood railroad ties. Based on this, he feels that the irrational use of timber in Taiwan is equivalent to not logging at all, and he believes that the provincial government's ban on timber exports is a major mistake. He hopes for a five-year plan, a "Forestry Law" specifically for Taiwan's forestry. With five years of dedicated management, the income can be increased more than tenfold, with six-tenths of the logging revenue being reinvested in reforestation. Relying on annual budget appropriations for reforestation will never succeed. The Forest Management Bureau's budget for reforestation this year was 2.4 billion yuan, but only 800 million yuan was approved. He is very confident that with just two words—Good Selling—</p>
<p>Cable Cars and Straight Ascension to the Peak</p>
<p>Mount Baxian has two noteworthy constructions: one is an inclined railway (Incline) that is over 1,800 meters long, the longest inclined railway in the Far East. It is divided into three sections, each ascending over 1,100 meters at an angle of about 30 degrees. It uses electric-powered cables to transport timber and has been in use for twenty-four years. Everything is dilapidated. Because there are many curves, timber transport is more difficult, averaging only 85 cubic meters per day. In today's terms, this is already an outdated tool. The second is the cableway. We departed from Jiabaohe Station, eight people packed into a box, and ascended via the cables, using the weight of the timber lowered from the mountain to climb straight to the peak. The feeling was ethereal, but looking down, we were more than 1,000 meters above the ground. If the cable were to break, the consequences would be unimaginable. The cable had been used for thirteen years and had many visible splices. Each logging area is requesting equipment replenishment. In the face of violent winds and rain, we traveled from the terminus of the cableway, New Mount Baxian, and then took a charcoal-powered vehicle, risking great danger, to see the timber collection machine. The workers in the logging area, who live permanently on this mountain over 2,000 feet high, wore tattered short shirts and trousers, but they still worked hard. These people are in the wind and rain, and the equipment is also in the wind and rain. Isn't the entire forestry industry of Taiwan also in the wind and rain?</p>
<p>Steep Slopes with a 1:1 Ratio</p>
<p>Professor Kao reports that he is willing to offer Taiwan's forestry as one of the joint undertakings of the United Nations. He conducted a detailed survey of the equipment shortages and also noted the number of sawmills throughout the province. He specifically pointed out that Taiwan can build as many timber processing plants as possible in the future, including plywood, tool handles, high-end furniture, and steam-treated wood products, all of which can be supplied to the world market, increasing the economy of Taiwan and even China as a whole. After boarding Mount Ali and Mount Baxian, he suggested that Hubei, Fujian, and the western powers should send people here to study and train the future backbone of China's forestry development. When I asked him why he specifically mentioned Hubei and Fujian provinces, he smiled and said that companies have been organized here before and have requested a lot of equipment, but they did not understand the development technology. Studying in Taiwan has two advantages: first, the projects are complete, covering the entire process from logging, timber collection, and transportation; second, the slopes are steep. In Australia, most slopes have an incline with a ratio of 1:4, while Taiwan has a ratio of 1:1. Being able to overcome this difficulty means being able to overcome any difficulty. He repeatedly praised the workers' skilled techniques. Director Tang said that Professor Kao's views have their unique insights, and these opinions may be shared with everyone who cares about Taiwan's forestry. (Reporter Yang Wenyu)</p>

<h3>Refugee Youths in Huaiyin Concentrated in Vocational Training Classes</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 21st] In order to align with the national policy of mobilizing for the suppression of rebellion, the "Youth Guidance" program closely follows the tide of national reconstruction and rushes towards the pacified areas, launching a rescue effort to save youths. Although thousands upon thousands of youths from northern Jiangsu have crossed the Yangtze River in batches, each finding a place to settle and warmth, there are still many youths trapped in the deep mire of the bandit areas, longing for relief and guidance. Huaiyin is an important town in northern Jiangsu, controlling the intersection of the Huai River and the Grand Canal, serving as a crucial passage between Jiangsu and Anhui, and as a hub connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River. Youths from Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Siyang, Chenfu, Ningshu, Shuyang, and Guanyun mostly gather and disperse here. How can we ignore the youths there? Therefore, the Jiangsu Youth Guidance Office of the Ministry of Education, facing the current reality and responding to local requests, decided to set up a guidance institution in April of last year, the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class, to take in the escaped youths from the Huaiyin area, provide them with material relief, give them vocational training, and revive their mental fatigue. This is the origin of the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class and its historical roots. Although the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class has only been growing for a short eight or nine months, it has already conducted two registrations, taking in nearly a thousand youths. The first term enrolled 482 youths, who have now all found employment. Some serve in education, shouldering cultural responsibilities; some work as administrative cadres, promoting local autonomy; and some handle cooperation, sharing the responsibility of economic construction. Such individualized guidance has fulfilled part of the responsibility to society, the country, and the youths, making some contributions. However, those in charge believe that it is still far from ideal and are not complacent. Therefore, how to work hard and make further plans in the future is the most important issue for them. The second registration of youths has just been completed, and the training plan is being implemented according to the scheduled procedures. This time, the number of people admitted is more than 300. From the conversations with the admitted youths, we know that their previously wandering and disappointed minds and bodies have received infinite comfort!</p>
<p>In short, the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class is growing. Although there are various difficulties that prevent their rescue and guidance work from being fully developed as ideally as possible, those working there have indeed made the greatest efforts. We can see the results before our eyes, and we can see the direction they are constantly moving in. (Our reporter He Xianglin)</p>
<h3>Old Woman's Sixth Pregnancy Results in Monkey-Like Monster Baby</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Hainan Island Office, 16th] At 2:00 PM on the 14th, at the Li Qifang Clinic on Zhangxing Street, Haikou City, Chen Zhou, a woman from Shuitou Village, Xiuying Township, gave birth to a strange stillborn baby resembling a monkey. It had a large head and small jaw, lacking a nose and upper lip. Its throat was directly connected to the top of its head. The hair on its head was black and long like down, and it had no cranial bone. The right ear was large, and the left ear was small. Its hands and feet were no different from a normal infant, and its body was quite strong. According to Dr. Li, the fetus moved frequently in the mother's womb but remained silent. This small life breathed its last at 8:00 PM. The mother is now safe and sound. The clinic believes that this fetus has research value and is now preserved in a glass bottle with formalin solution. Upon hearing the news, citizens flocked to see it from morning till night and discussed it, saying that the woman was already 53 years old, exceeding the age of fertility. Generally, women over 49 years old experience menopause and stop childbearing, but this woman, at the advanced age of 53, gave birth to a strange infant, which is truly a strange occurrence. According to the reporter's investigation, the woman had previously given birth to six children, both male and female, who died shortly after birth, either after three or four months or two or three years. None of them lived to adulthood. This fetus was her sixth pregnancy, and she had been pregnant for eleven full months. During the abnormal pregnancy, she lived a normal life. At around 11:00 AM on the 14th, her husband accompanied her to the clinic for delivery. The doctor found that the fetus's buttocks were presenting first, which was not a normal delivery. He asked her husband to sign the consent form and then performed a surgery to extract the fetus.</p>

<h3>The First Lesson of Southern Democracy: A Large-Scale Election Education Movement Unfolds</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhoupu Office, 22nd] On the 21st, the people of Nanhui began to receive the first lesson in democracy. Because of the promotion by the Nanhui County Election Education Movement Promotion Association, the people were slowly starting to feel interested in this matter, or at least it had caught their attention. Those who had not received their voting cards knew to urge the Baojia heads to get them, and those who had already received their voting cards were preparing to show their skills and try out this power that they had never truly used before.</p>
<p>Of course, this is, after all, the first lesson, and not everything can go as we wish. At the same time, due to the different levels of effort of those in charge, there are bound to be different results among the various villages and Baos. The reporter is willing to briefly report on the situation witnessed on the first day:</p>
<p>Polling Stations: One Per Bao. To meet the needs of universal voting, the Nanhui County Election Office presented a request to the provincial government to set up more polling stations. The standard is one per Bao, for a total of 499 in the county. Zhoupu Town has 21 Baos, so there are also 21 polling stations. At 9:00 AM, the administrators and supervisors of each polling station arrived one after another, and voting began. Voters also poured in like a flowing stream, and the results were very satisfactory. Throughout Nanhui County, only a few Baos, either because the Bao head was negligent and the procedures had not been completed, or because the Bao head was tied up with private matters and could not start the election as scheduled, but these were very few phenomena. The general situation was very good.</p>
<p>Wang Genzhong Campaigns for Di Ying. Wang Genzhong is a candidate for election to Di Ying, supported by all sectors of Nanhui, and is also the initiator of this election education movement. This time, he almost ignored the issue of his own votes and election, and single-mindedly used all his strength to promote the election education movement. At 9:00 AM on the 21st, he personally went to the fifth Bao of Zhoupu Town to vote as a voter, and he voted for Di Ying.</p>
<p>As for the other voters, voting was absolutely free, and the targets of the election were also quite widespread. However, according to general estimates, Wang Genzhong received an absolute majority of the votes.</p>
<p>Propaganda Vehicles Set Off on Patrol</p>
<p>After the voting began, the election education propaganda work was carried out even more actively. The propaganda train of the Election Education Promotion Association set off yesterday to the distant northern areas of Beicai, Zhangjiang, and Guhe. The costumed propaganda team of the Shupu group went to Duxing and Luohui yesterday and continued to Xuanqiao Township today. In addition, the propaganda team of Dajiang Middle School also went to the Zhoupu area. No matter which team or which team member, they all participated in the work with great enthusiasm. Because they know that they are not campaigning for any one person; they are promoting democratic education, which is the most practical and timely social education.</p>
<p>As of the evening of the 21st, the voting rate in various places averaged over 60%. Among them, the first, ninth, and tenth Baos of Luhui Township and the first Bao of Liuzao Township completed all voting. The eighth Bao of Xinchang Town and the tenth Bao of Tanzhi Township also reached 98%. With two more days of effort, the results will be considerable. Therefore, several gentlemen from the Election Education Movement Promotion Association breathed a sigh of relief and said, "This election education movement can be considered a success, and our efforts have finally paid off!"</p>

<h3>Tongji University Student Strike at a Standstill</h3>
<p>President Ding Hopes Students Will Return to Class Tomorrow; Rumors That Zhu Jiahua Will Return to Shanghai from Taiwan to Mediate</p>
<p>[Report from our office] Tongji University students have been on strike for a week to protest the school's arbitrary expulsion of classmates. The opinions of both sides are deadlocked and becoming increasingly sharp. The expelled students have no relatives in Shanghai and are all living on campus, maintaining close contact with the students still in school. In order to concentrate their forces and discuss how to deal with the school's actions, the students of the liberal arts and medical colleges moved into the engineering college on Qimei Road yesterday for food and lodging. The students of the freshman college and the law college are also scheduled to move into the engineering college in the next two days to show their determination to persevere to the end. Since President Ding Wenyuan, all department heads have not been working on campus these days. Although the professors of each college department want to go to school to teach, the classrooms are quiet and empty. Some of those willing to teach are also emotionally unsettled and have left one after another. According to President Ding in a telephone call last night, he hopes that the students will all return to class tomorrow, otherwise, the fourth list of expelled students will be announced immediately. He also scheduled an administrative meeting for 3:00 PM today to discuss the matter. Ding did not deny that the school's strike problem would be difficult to resolve satisfactorily in the short term, because he believes that in implementing the national education policy and maintaining the dignity of school administration, he will never compromise on the students' insistence on illegal demands. Yesterday, the reporter visited several professors at the school. They all refused to express their opinions, saying that "it is difficult to speak," and were unwilling to come forward to mediate, only hoping that Tongji alumni would come forward to mediate, which would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] It was widely rumored at the school yesterday that many influential Tongji alumni, such as Tang Zhe, were mediating and had telegraphed Minister Zhu Jiahua to fly from Taiwan to Shanghai to participate in the mediation as a Tongji alumnus. Also, the Tongji Veterans Youth Friendship Association sent several representatives yesterday to meet with President Ding in a third-party capacity, requesting a disguised recognition of the newly elected student union in order to break the long-term stalemate and facilitate an early return to class. President Ding did not grant their request and urged the students to return to class, after which they could prepare for the student union in accordance with the new student union charter promulgated by the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University President Advocates Work-Study Program</h3>

<h3>Professors from the Social Education College Went to Beijing Yesterday to Petition</h3>
<p>Requesting Treatment to be Reclassified as Third Zone [Report from our Suzhou office] All professors of the National Social Education College believe that Suzhou is close to Shanghai, and the general price level is not lower than Shanghai but higher than Nanjing. In the past, the treatment of public education personnel was one level lower than that of Beijing and Shanghai, but national schools still had a special subsidy allowance. The recent salary adjustment method canceled the special subsidy allowance, and Suzhou was classified as the fourth zone. This time, schools in Beijing and Shanghai increased by 120%, while Suzhou only increased by 50% and had no in-kind rations. They expressed extreme dissatisfaction with this. On the 22nd, four professors were specially sent as representatives to Beijing to appeal to the central government, requesting that the treatment of public education personnel in Suzhou be reclassified as the third zone.</p>

<h3>Tuition Fees for Private Schools Next Semester Will Not Be Restricted As a Principle</h3>
<p>Li Ximou Told Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>[Report from our office] Li Ximou, acting director of the Municipal Education Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools next semester will not be restricted as a principle. However, if the bureau believes that the number stipulated by each school is unreasonable, it will convene a council to submit it for discussion. Director Li also hopes that each school will increase the number of free places as much as possible to accommodate poor students and avoid dropping out of school. Regarding the matter of the teachers and staff of municipal middle schools borrowing one month's salary for February, Director Li agreed to lend it as well, since municipal primary school teachers and staff should be treated equally.</p>
<p>[Report from our office] Jiang Jiju, chairman of the Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city, visited Li, the acting director of the Education Bureau, yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of private school teachers and staff requesting in-kind rations. According to Jiang, Director Li expressed great sympathy for this request, but because the decision-making power rests with the central government, he will express his views to the central government immediately. If it is approved, according to the current price calculation, the school's expenditure on teachers' and staff's treatment can be reduced by one-third, and tuition fees can also be reduced by one-third as a result.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of private school fees for the next semester, Jiang said that it is still early before the start of school, and a regular discussion has not yet been scheduled.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Issue Purchase Certificates to Prevent Fraudulent Claims</h3>

<h3>Interest on Private School Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees Will Be Used to Fund Teacher Training</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Instructed the Education Bureau to Comply [Dahua News Agency] Regarding the requests of private school teachers and staff in this city to be provided with in-kind rations, to be issued teacher training fees, and to have in-kind rations provided to the heads and workers of national education classes in private schools, the Municipal Government has recently instructed the Education Bureau to review and issue three points: In-kind rations for private schools will be handled after receiving the order from the Executive Yuan. Teacher training fees for private schools will be funded by interest on tuition and miscellaneous fees. The request for in-kind rations for the heads and workers of national education classes in private schools does not comply with the regulations and is difficult to approve.</p>
<h3>Trisecting Any Angle is Still a Difficult Problem</h3>
<p>Based on Euclid's Geometric Construction Postulates</p>
<p>Our readers Xiao Chengji and Kong Fanqing sent letters criticizing a reader in Xi'an for saying that "trisecting any angle is not a difficult problem," believing that it was not correct. The contents of the letters are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"I saw in your newspaper on the 13th that a reader from Xi'an stated a method for trisecting an arbitrary angle with a straightedge, saying: 'Pass the straightedge through point B, move it within this angle to make the BE line, intersecting the DG line at F and the DP line at E, such that EF is twice the length of BD.' This method actually violates Euclid's geometric construction postulates, because the so-called elementary geometry construction, in addition to limiting the use of compasses and straightedges, the Euclid's Elements also has regulations on the use of these two tools: A straight line can be drawn through two points. A circle can be drawn with a fixed point as the center and a fixed length as the radius. The reason why trisecting an angle is impossible is due to this kind of restriction. Now, the application of the straightedge in the above method has exceeded Euclid's postulates, so it cannot be regarded as a legitimate method. As for this problem, I completely agree with the opinion of Dr. Zhang Dexin, Dean of Academic Affairs of Changda, and its theoretical basis has long been recognized by the mathematical community. Shen Bao reader Xiao Chengji"</p>
<p>"I recently read in your newspaper on the 13th that a reader from Xi'an submitted a letter stating: 'Trisecting any angle is not a difficult problem,' and also gave a method of division using only a straightedge, but he neglected the conditions limited by Euclidean geometry—a compass and a non-graduated straightedge (even triangles cannot be used). Under the restrictions of Euclidean geometric construction, drawing a parallel line (or perpendicular line) requires the use of a compass, but how did this reader, who learned the method of using only a straightedge at Beiyang University, make the perpendicular line DG and the parallel line DE? But this BE line can never be made with a compass and a straightedge, so this method cannot be regarded as a solution. The Yang method that was rumored for a while is still an approximate method, but it is not the purpose of Euclidean geometry. However, Mr. Yang still knew to state in advance that he 'had not studied higher mathematics,' that is, Mr. Yang still knew that his learning was insufficient (Mr. Yang's method does not require higher mathematics to prove its error, we will not discuss this in detail for the time being). And this reader quoted what 'Professor ××× of Beiyang University said…' as proof, which is a bit laughable. This is my humble opinion, and I hope it will be published to set things straight. Shen Bao reader Kong Fanqing."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guanghan News] Yuan Chenglin, an engineer from the 30th Engineering Section of the 8th General Engineering Section of the 5th District Highway Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications Highway Administration, saw in the newspaper that Dr. Zhang Dexin, Dean of Academic Affairs of Changda, expressed doubt about Yang Jiaru's invention of "trisecting any angle," believing that it was impossible. He said that the problem of "making a circle equal to a square" or "making a square equal to a circle" had been raised at the Nobel Prize Society, indicating that it was necessarily solvable, but no one had yet obtained the correct answer. Mr. Yuan was deeply interested and, after research, obtained a solution to the three questions of "trisecting any angle," "making a circle equal to a square," and "making a square equal to a circle." The method is simple and the proof is correct. Mr. Yuan has now sent letters to teaching experts across the country for discussion and has listed the solution method for research by people across the country. Anyone can make a drawing according to his method. Letters can be sent to 97 Nanjing Road, Guanghan, Yun. [Announcement] Recently, our newspaper readers have sent letters to discuss the issue of "trisecting any angle." We are deeply grateful, but due to space limitations, we cannot disclose them one by one. We hope for your forgiveness. Editor</p>

<h3>China Trust Bureau Hong Kong Branch Sets Up Measures to Advance Funds for Purchasing Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>To Assist Domestic Manufacturers in Increasing Production.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau has established measures to advance funds for purchasing industrial raw materials in order to encourage domestic industry, increase production, support manufacturers, and promote people's livelihood. Any domestic manufacturer who has been granted an import quota for industrial raw materials by the Export-Import Management Committee may entrust the Central Trust Bureau to advance funds for purchasing and transporting the quota of raw materials. Domestic manufacturers who intend to entrust the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau to advance funds for purchasing raw materials should request a price quote from the local Central Trust Bureau or directly from the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau, and should request that the Central Trust Bureau be listed as the consignor and recipient in the import permit. In order to meet the deadline of the import permit, the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau will only accept the entrusted purchase of raw materials that can be purchased in Hong Kong for the time being. The measures for purchasing from Europe and the United States will be discussed separately. If a manufacturer can provide evidence of having the seasonal quota and pay a 30% deposit, the Bureau may pre-order the materials. If an import permit has already been obtained and the permit is handed over to the Bureau to handle the import procedures, no deposit is required, but a guarantor approved by the Central Trust Bureau must be obtained before the entrustment can be accepted. The Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau will advance all expenses for the price of the raw materials, warehouse rent, insurance, and freight, and will transport the materials to China for import and hand them over to the local Central Trust Bureau warehouse for safekeeping, notifying the manufacturer to pick up the goods. After the entrusted raw materials are imported, foreign exchange settlement procedures will be carried out. When the foreign exchange is obtained, the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau must be reimbursed for the advance funds, interest, and handling fees. The deadline for the advance funds for the entrusted purchase of raw materials shall not exceed the date stipulated in the import permit. The interest rate on the advance funds shall be calculated at a weekly rate of 7%, plus a handling fee of 0.1%. After the entrusted manufacturer is notified by the local Central Trust Bureau that the raw materials have been imported, it must settle the foreign exchange and pick up the goods within 14 days. If the deadline is exceeded, the local Central Trust Bureau will handle the foreign exchange settlement and dispose of the goods freely, unless otherwise agreed with the local Central Trust Bureau in advance.</p>

As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yisha and British Union rose slightly, Jardine Matheson, Jardine Brewery, and Ken Zhi were flat, Paper Edition and Navigation each fell 5%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Export-Import Management Committee Approves Advance Import of Goatskin Packaging Materials</h3>
<p>After the export packaging materials import measures were approved by the Executive Yuan, the Export-Import Management Committee immediately followed up with registration. The registration in this city has been completed, and various districts outside the city have also been reporting one after another. As of now, the committee has received 331 applications, including 197 from this city, 24 from Qingdao, 104 from Tianjin, 3 from Chongqing, and 3 from Hankou. Only the offices in Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Shenyang have not yet submitted their reports. The committee's Export Promotion Division has begun to review those that are needed seasonally. In practical terms, packaging materials such as tinplate and camphor for goatskin are the most urgent. Therefore, the review has begun. For every million goatskins, 30 tons of camphor and 15 tons of tinplate are needed. Camphor costs 80 to 85 pounds per ton internationally, and tinplate costs 6 yuan in gold per 100 pounds. The committee has sent a letter to the Central Bank to prepare to allocate this foreign exchange quota. According to export industry authorities: 6 million goatskins can be exported this year, with an average price of 1 US dollar per skin, which can be exchanged for 6 million US dollars in foreign exchange. However, due to poor transportation, it may be difficult to achieve this goal.</p>
<h3>National Bank of China Adjusts Operations and Implements Regional Bank System</h3>
<p>Wang Zhong is appointed as the director of the Northeast Regional Bank. In order to adjust its operations, the National Bank of China abolished 14 sub-branches last year and established new branches in Yan'an, Yantai, and other places. In addition to the Yan'an branch, which has already opened, the Yantai branch is also actively preparing to open. The establishment of the Northeast Regional Bank has been prepared, and recently Wang Zhong, the special commissioner for the Northeast region, has been reassigned as the director of the Northeast Regional Bank, marking the beginning of the bank's pilot regional bank system.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine Declines: The market for Chinese medicine has once again entered a state of difficulty. The foreign and Guangdong traders' pepper and black Sichuan increased to a peak price of 260,000, but because the Shandong traders stopped operating and sales in other places were stagnant, coupled with the extremely tight credit situation among traders and the continuous arrival of goods, prices have been falling frequently. Yesterday the price fell to 160,000, but there were still few takers. The price difference per catty was 100,000 yuan in one week. However, Da He Xiang's firm reputation is stable. Sichuan Han, Xi Huai, Guan Bei, and other goods are still considered firm.</p>
<p>Buddha's Hand Slices: There are few arrivals and smooth sales. The market price is 140,000 yuan, but there is no stock. The Hong Kong market quotation, plus foreign fees, shows that the cost of new arrivals is more than 217,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Longkou Noodles Loosen: Longkou thread noodles and dried noodles, which had risen too sharply before, have also fallen with the general decline in prices, falling by 10% to 20% from before. Yesterday, the market price for good genuine goods was 9 million yuan, and 8.5 million yuan for the next best.</p>
<h3>The Financial Management Bureau Will Not Loosen Its Freeze on Speculative Bank Notes</h3>
<p>Regarding the freezing of bank notes, the City Bank Association submitted a document to the Financial Management Bureau yesterday requesting the unfreezing. The reason is that since the bank has not been declared for liquidation, the bank notes should not be frozen. However, according to a person in charge of the Financial Management Bureau: According to Article 9 of the authorities' measures for controlling financial operations, if it is found that there is any situation that promotes speculation and hoarding, emergency measures may be taken to advise the bank to suspend operations and liquidate, and to transfer its managers to the court for punishment. Moreover, according to the Ministry of Finance's telegram No. 29983 of July 17, 1947 (Financial Money Gen), the practice of allowing bills to be used as cash before they are collected is not only sufficient to expand credit, but also makes it difficult for the banks themselves to manage their funds, creating major drawbacks and posing a considerable risk, and has been corrected by the Ministry of Finance in the past. After investigation, this kind of situation is still prevalent. In order to implement government decrees, the bureau will strictly deal with any speculative behavior and any suspected gold and silver business violations found during inspections. In addition to handling them according to law, all bills and checks will be frozen first, and no leniency will be granted.</p>
<h3>Last November's Import and Export Trade: Trade Deficit Improved, Increased Exports and Decreased Imports Were Rare Occurrences in the Past</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the import and export trade statistics for China in November of last year released by the Inspectorate General of Customs, the trade deficit improved compared to previous months. Exports sharply increased, nearly tripling compared to October, while imports also decreased compared to October. This was a rare occurrence before November of last year. The relevant figures are detailed below:</p>
<p>The net value of imports in November was 1,678,770,397,000 yuan, and the net value of exports was 1,560,524,082,000 yuan, resulting in a total trade deficit of 118,246,315,000 yuan. Compared to October, the net value of imports in October was 1,746,766,278,000 yuan, meaning the net value of imports in November decreased by 67,995,881,000 yuan. The net value of exports in October was 530,040,429,000 yuan, meaning the net value of exports in November sharply increased by 1,030,483,653,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Among the sharply increased exports, textiles (疋頭) accounted for the largest share, totaling 409.1 billion yuan. Other significant exports included pig bristles and animal products, totaling 261.9 billion yuan; tung oil and wax, 218.5 billion yuan; metals and mineral ores, 141.9 billion yuan; soybeans, peanuts, etc., 163.8 billion yuan; grains, 24.7 billion yuan; and tea, 48.6 billion yuan.</p>
<p>In November, the main export destination for China was still the United States, importing 480 billion yuan worth of goods. Hong Kong followed with 335 billion yuan, and India with 99.7 billion yuan. The main import source for China was also the United States, exporting 786.4 billion yuan worth of goods to China. India followed with 229 billion yuan, and the United Kingdom with 123.4 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Plans to Resume Bartering Salt for Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>After the Central Trust Bureau stopped bartering salt for Japanese goods last year, the bartering trade with Japan has not been able to resume. The goods Japan shipped to China for bartering have all been done on account, and China has not yet determined what other goods to use to offset the value of the Japanese goods. However, China does have a surplus in salt production, which China itself cannot fully utilize. Therefore, the Bureau is currently consulting with the Salt Administration and other relevant agencies, planning to resume bartering salt for Japanese goods in the near future. This will serve to exchange for raw materials needed by China and to repay the debts from last year.</p>
<h3>Industry Insiders Analyze Difficulties in Chinese Tea Exports</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent situation of Chinese tea exports, its inherent difficulties, and future prospects, here is an analysis from qualified individuals in the tea industry, outlining the general situation: The international market still primarily targets the United States. To encourage exports, after the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, the government adjusted prices dynamically based on actual conditions. While this provided some benefits to exporters, buyers in the United States felt that the foreign exchange rate was unstable and, to avoid losses, dared not purchase in large quantities, instead opting for small transactions: selling a certain amount and then replenishing that amount, resulting in stagnant wholesale sales. Trade with France is not conducted in US dollars; it must first be converted from francs to gold pounds or US dollars. Import and export controls are as strict as those in China, and not all of its exports can be approved for import into China. Furthermore, among the goods that France might import, not all are Chinese tea, resulting in reduced fragmented sales. For large-scale transactions of green tea, a new avenue has been opened. Last year's shipments were managed by the French Yongxing Trading Company in Shanghai, entrusted by the French delegation. There were several shipments to France last year, with the last batch consisting of about 30,000 cases, each weighing about 60 catties, totaling about 18,000 dan. The price per dan was 2.4 million to 2.8 million yuan for Chunmee green tea, and 1.7 million to 1.8 million yuan for Ping green tea, with Yongxing accounting for the majority. Other companies, such as China Tea Company, Wang Yutai, and Wuchang, also entrusted Yongxing to transport their goods. Before the war, British black tea sold very well. After the war, a nationwide culture of frugality in Britain led to a reluctance to taste high-quality Chinese tea, preferring to lower standards and opt for inferior teas. Sales of Soviet tea bricks were also strong in the past, but due to unresolved bartering procedures, it is temporarily impossible to promote sales, although it remains an ideal market in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the internal difficulties of tea and its future prospects, the individuals believe that tea is generally calculated based on rice, with each three dan of rice equated to one dan of tea. The cost of tea itself accounts for one and a half dan of rice, with the rest covering processing, transportation, and packaging costs. Recalling that the price of tea was 300,000 yuan per dan in the previous year, a fund of 1 billion yuan could purchase over 3,000 dan of tea. Last year, the price of tea rose to 1.5 million yuan per dan, so the original fund could only purchase about 660 dan of tea. According to the current price of rice, only about 200 dan can be purchased. If there is a shortage of grain and the price of rice fluctuates again, the amount will be even smaller. Due to this reason, tea merchants are intimidated by the large amount of capital required, and their profits are minimal. The future of tea is shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere, which is the source of the crisis. To improve this situation, the government must be called upon to assist. The first principle is to entrust tea merchants with "processing on behalf," granting them legitimate profits to improve quality, reduce costs, promote exports, and earn foreign exchange. The second is "procurement," with the government quickly providing large loans for tea merchants to produce finished products, which are then purchased at actual cost, with the government subsidizing the difference to encourage exports.</p>
<h3>Promoting Exports of Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>China Sericulture Trust and Xinguang Weaving produce Silk Shirts</p>
<p>To promote the export of silk fabrics, the China Sericulture Company has had its silk woven into silk fabric suitable for export underwear. It is cooperating with Xinguang Underwear Company to have the silk fabric made into shirts and underwear for sale in Europe, the Americas, and Southeast Asia. It is reported that shirts of the same quality from abroad cost about 1.4 million yuan each when imported into China. The shirts made from this silk fabric cost only 700,000 yuan each. More than a dozen styles of sample shirts in various colors have been produced. They are colorful, inexpensive, and of high quality, making the prospects for export optimistic. At the same time, they also meet the needs of domestic people, reducing the import of foreign goods, easing the burden on consumers, and reducing the outflow of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to statistics from the China Sericulture Company, last year's silk exports to the United States accounted for 2,150 bales, India 1,240 bales, Burma 1,600 bales, the United Kingdom 1,165 bales, Annam 40 bales, France 73 bales, and the Soviet Union 600 bales. The shipments currently being prepared include 800 bales to the United States and 1,300 bales to Burma. The method of shipment is consignment to the United States, bartering to the Soviet Union, and direct trade with signed contracts to the rest. The export price is 3 yuan per pound. The price for US consignment is determined by market prices, but the US market price has now fallen to 2.6 yuan, affecting all countries. Value-added silk fabrics, such as those woven into pajamas and evening gowns, can be worth 4 to 5 yuan per pound, which is more profitable than raw silk. According to the Silk Weaving Industry Association, last year from May to the end of the year, India alone sold 99,000 pieces of our silk fabrics. Although affected by the internal turmoil in India, sales are still not a problem. The silk fabrics shipped to India last year can be exchanged for 5 million US dollars in foreign exchange. If the government can provide maximum assistance to exports, India alone can generate 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange each year.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Restrictions on Imported Foreign Yarn Tubes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] To protect China's nascent industries, the import of foreign yarn tubes has been approved by the Executive Yuan for restriction. The import of Japanese yarn tubes will be prohibited after the opening of trade with Japan. This matter was at the request of the Yarn Tube Industry Association, and the National Economic Council sent a letter to the Transport Control Committee to restrict imports and requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to instruct the Central Industrial Experiment Institute to urge the improvement of domestically produced yarn tubes.</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>The Medical Artisan</h3>
<p>— Yao Xingshu</p>
<p>If our memories serve us correctly, we should still remember the "Fake Phoenix, False Emperor" dispute—one of Shanghai's top ten news stories in 1936—, "What a mess!", compatriots flared up and geared up over a feud over a "artisan". Even though I am ignorant, I'm not belittling this to the extent of ignoring common sense, and daring to use words that are not well-balanced, am I not afraid of making a fool of myself? But wait—</p>
<p>Originally, these two words "medical artisan" were not something I blurted out; in the Urgent Chapters written by Han Dynasty historian You, there is a sentence: "Support the declining and welcome the medical artisan". The ancient people used the words "medical artisan" before me. If there is a crime in using words improperly, then the crime lies with Shi You.</p>
<p>"Artisan" is a general term for all laborers, so coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, plasterers, ... (excuse my bluntness) and so on, are endless. Labor is the most sacred thing, and there is nothing lowly about being an "artisan." There is no shortage of people in Shanghai who started as "artisans," only scholars are useless. "Artisan" is also interpreted as planning and production, Garden Notes: "All come from their planning and crafting." Planning and production often require a lot of brainpower, which is mental labor; okay, physical labor and mental labor are all gathered in one "artisan," "artisan" is such a noble profession—</p>
<p>Well said, Shi You!—"Support the declining," means that people are troubled by chronic illnesses; when people get sick, it's like a moving machine temporarily "breaking down." When a machine breaks down, you can only ask an artisan to repair it. Seeing a doctor as an artisan who repairs machines of flesh and blood and welcome them, the ancient meaning and today's principles are all consistent. Shi You's use of words is: clever and appropriate, nothing more can be added. We clinical medical people ask ourselves, are we doing our best to repair the sick human body? Naturally, a machine that is completely broken cannot be repaired by anyone; but, dare to say that everyone has "devoted their best" to it? Only the two words "medical artisan" can express the nature of our profession and the noble character. Therefore, I differ from some people's views and do not hate the word "artisan," but find it refined and lovely. Many things that are not pleasing to the eye may calm your mind and ease your emotions after understanding the reason. "Foolishness causes trouble, all because of lack of understanding," recalling the "Fake Phoenix, False Emperor" storm, I can't help but feel this way, which greatly deviates from the way of mental hygiene, using "medical artisan" to show its commonness.</p>
<h3>The Remodeling of Medical Skills and Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Qu Dianhong</p>
<p>The medicine of the atomic age is, after all, trending towards atomization. Although the current stage of development doesn't yet allow you to buy a bottle of "intelligence pills" at will to improve your work ability and comprehension, don't worry! This possibility is no longer an empty fantasy.</p>
<p>In the past, medicine was simply helpless when dealing with a child with slow thinking. Scientific progress could only allow us to prove in various ways that a person's intelligence was not up to standard. As for how to improve their intelligence, we had to wait for future inventions. Fortunately, there is a group of pioneers in the medical field who are working hard regardless of cost. As a result, they gave a substance called Glutamic Acid to a child whose intelligence could not keep up with the norm. After six months, they obtained a surprising conclusion: the child's intelligence suddenly progressed rapidly at an exceeding rate within these few months!</p>
<p>What secrets does Glutamic Acid have? Even the doctors who invented Glutamic Acid cannot give you a precise and detailed answer. However, they do know that this substance is closely related to the highly effective chemical substance Acetylcholine. According to scientists' research and experiments, we already believe that Acetylcholine can promote the transmission of information and commands within the nervous system. In other words, the existence of Acetylcholine is an essential element for maintaining the normal state of the nervous system. Based on the above two points of confidence, it is not difficult for us to speculate that taking Glutamic Acid can directly increase the production of Acetylcholine and indirectly promote the activity of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Let us imagine that our brain is a crystal of countless intricately mixed nerve cells. If your brain is normal, then no matter how astonishingly large the number of cells is, there must be a close connection between them. Scientists cannot completely explain how they achieve this mysterious connection. They can only speculate that this may be due to the effects of electrical waves and chemistry. If you can come up with a way to strengthen the impulses of the nervous system, then you can improve your intelligence. The method we are going to try is to use Glutamic Acid to increase Acetylcholine production.</p>
<p>Glutamic Acid has been around for a long time, but only in the last decade have people realized its hidden power. Frederick Zimmerman, a famous professor at the Columbia University Institute of Neurology, and his friend Sharmann Ross once used rats to conduct experiments. They made a large maze-like box and placed food at the end of the box. Then, they put a group of normal, healthy rats that had been selected beforehand into the box (half of which were fed a daily dose of Glutamic Acid). As a result, half of the rats were like ants in a hot pot, rushing around blindly, while the other half of the rats that had eaten Glutamic Acid were different. They quickly ran out of the maze and reached the end of the box. Later, K.E. Alder and C.J. Warden also used rats to conduct similar experiments. They made a wooden box with four wooden boards placed horizontally in the box, and food was placed at the end of the box. According to the records, rats can cross two wooden boards without any difficulty; if they take some time and effort, they can cross three wooden boards, but no matter how hungry they are, three wooden boards is the highest limit. Later, they fed them Glutamic Acid, and as a result, Glutamic Acid had an amazing effect. The rats eventually crossed all four wooden boards and obtained the food. This Glutamic Acid experiment made us think of a question: if Glutamic Acid can do this for rats, then what about humans? As soon as this question came to mind, someone buried themselves in research. As a result, three medical researchers, J.C. Pricej, H.W. Calch, and Tracy Puteam, discovered that Glutamic Acid can treat petit mal epilepsy, reducing the frequency of seizures and the suffering of patients. For example, a twenty-five-year-old young man injured his brain as a child and suffered from Petitmal Epileptic. As a result, 12 grams of Glutamic Acid per day not only stopped the epileptic seizures, but also changed his previous sluggishness. Seven months later, he stopped taking Glutamic Acid, and during the period of discontinuation, he returned to his previous condition. For example, a child with delayed development, actually two years old, could not speak or walk; not to mention speaking and walking, he didn't even have the energy to play. Dr. Zimmerman also tried Glutamic Acid. After a month, the child was happily building blocks. Later, because his appetite was affected, Glutamic Acid was temporarily discontinued. Heavens! The child lost interest in building blocks again, and he returned to his previous sluggish state! There was no other way but to give him Glutamic Acid again (initially in small amounts, then gradually increasing). Strangely, the child happily built blocks again, and after six months, the child could walk!</p>
<p>Many experiments have also been done on the relationship between Glutamic Acid and intelligence. The conclusion is that Glutamic Acid can indeed increase the intelligence quotient by eight to eleven. To put it more clearly, the rate of intelligence progress can be increased by two times.</p>
<p>Glutamic Acid can not only improve intelligence, but it can also improve human personality. A sixteen-year-old girl, on the surface, seemed very normal, with no problems at all, but she frowned all day long, didn't like making friends, and was even more afraid of socializing. She didn't feel the slightest interest in the various subjects at school. Later, after giving her 12 grams of Glutamic Acid every day for five months, her personality changed drastically. She smiled all day long, automatically participated in various activities, and her school grades improved greatly. There was also a twelve-year-old boy, who should have been a carefree and lively child, but that was not the case. He moved slowly, couldn't concentrate his thoughts, and sometimes lost his self-control, even speaking incoherently. Glutamic Acid was tried again, first three times a day, each time. Result: no improvement was seen; so, the dose was increased, three times a day, each time. This time, Glutamic Acid's power came. The child became active and the previous nervousness completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Although the Glutamic Acid experiment has achieved considerable success, we cannot be satisfied; because the results of the experiment also tell us that its effectiveness is not sustainable. After taking it continuously for a year, even if you continue to take it, the rate of increase in intelligence progress will gradually decrease, and taking too much has also caused side effects of insomnia and anxiety (although there is no fixed standard for the dose, the daily amount should not exceed 24 grams). So, we still have to do more experiments to study and improve. We want to enhance our intelligence, so we must first make full use of our existing intelligence!

<h3>Precocious Puberty</h3>
<p>— Wang Meixian</p>
<p>"Five-Day-Old Baby Girl Exhibits Signs of Puberty"</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Shen Bao had a news dispatch that sensationalized Fuzhou City: "The wife of Wang Wencheng, a resident of Shishi Lane in Xiamen, gave birth to a baby girl the day before yesterday. Everything was normal after the birth, but yesterday, the nurse who delivered the baby found that the baby girl's breasts were high and protruding, and breast milk was overflowing. She also had menstrual phenomenon. A five-day-old baby has signs of puberty, and the news has spread far and wide." Normal girls will not have high and protruding breasts and menstrual periods, which are signs of puberty, until they are fourteen or fifteen years old. How could a five-day-old baby girl have signs of puberty?</p>
<p>According to the above report, it looks just like a case of "congenital female precocious puberty" in medicine. Apart from reasons of chromosomes or genetic factors, there is no way to explain its cause; so, it can only be given the title "congenital" to represent it. This type of congenital precocious puberty in women is actually more common than that caused by granular cell tumors, but general gynecologists often tend to think of this etiology first, leading to opening the abdominal cavity and taking a biopsy for examination. The difference between congenital precocious puberty and that caused by granular cell tumors is that not only are there menstrual periods, but ovulation can also occur, which means that young girls can also become pregnant and give birth if they have the opportunity. In 1940, a girl in Lima, Peru, who was only five years and eight months old, gave birth to a full-term baby, a girl who still needed to be taken care of by others, actually became a mother. According to Novak's report, there are nine cases of congenital precocious puberty, with ages ranging from fifteen months, two years, two years and eight months, four years, four and a half years, six and a half years, seven years, and seven and a half years, etc. (see Amer.J.Obs.&amp;Gyp47.20.1944). It's just that no one in China has compiled reports, but only treats it as news reports.</p>
<p>What should you do if you encounter such a case of congenital precocious puberty? It is best to use physiological treatment methods to avoid the little girl developing a kind of awkward, inferior, or abnormal psychology. At the same time, strictly avoid contact with the opposite sex before the appropriate age, so as to avoid accidents such as fertilization and childbirth. This, of course, is what parents should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Biological Products</h3>
<p>— Wang Meixian</p>
<p>Due to the discovery and widespread application of sulfonamide drugs, penicillin, and streptomycin, there are already methods for preventing and treating Gram-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, and Gram-positive Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore, the production and application of this type of vaccine serum has been discontinued in recent years. We very much hope to have chemical or antibiotic products that are easy to manufacture, low in cost, accurate in potency, and can be mass-produced to replace biological products, but as of now, many pathogenic bacteria (typhoid fever, tuberculosis, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, etc. bacilli and cholera vibrio), rickettsiae (typhus, trench fever), and viruses (smallpox, rabies, influenza, etc.), have no appropriate and effective chemical or antibiotic drugs invented yet. Biological products are still the only good method for targeted prevention and treatment, and bacterial immunology is still constantly discovering and improving. Therefore, we hope to take a two-pronged approach, advancing on both fronts, to annihilate pathogens and ensure human health.</p>
<p>If you want biological products to maintain good potency, then you must pay close attention to the preservation methods. Generally, they should all be stored in a cool, dark place. The expiration dates are marked on all products. These are all based on reasonable storage methods. If the preservation is not appropriate and they are exposed to heat and light, they will quickly lose their efficacy. For example, if smallpox vaccine is stored at 0 degrees Celsius, it can remain effective for six months. If it is placed at room temperature for two or three months, it will lose its efficacy. Various bacterial vaccines stored at 5 to 10 degrees Celsius can maintain their effectiveness for 9 to 12 months. Various serum antitoxins stored at zero degrees Celsius can be stored effectively for two years. At present, pharmacies, hospitals, and practicing physicians in our country mostly do not have appropriate water tank equipment, as well as transportation and delivery, and they should indeed pay attention to the potency and preservation of the products.</p>
<p>Biological products can be completely manufactured domestically, without relying on foreign goods. Generally, Chinese people have always thought that "foreign goods are always better than domestic goods." I dare not judge other goods arbitrarily, but domestic biological products are stronger than foreign goods. Because the various products made abroad are all made with foreign strains, which may not be suitable for the strains prevalent in our country. We use the strains prevalent in our country that are the most immune-rich to make the products, which are closer in nature, and can exert their immune power more after injection. Therefore, the import of this type of product should be prohibited to save foreign exchange. Even if they are aid or relief items, it is better to exchange them for domestic machines or raw materials that cannot be made, which is more practical.</p>
<p>Biological products, whether used for treatment or prevention, are injections, and are directly related to human life. Therefore, whether the products are pure and good, whether the potency is accurate, and whether they are qualified in terms of physics and chemistry, should all be carefully and precisely tested in advance before they are used in the human body. Guansi has the "Bacteriology and Immunology Products Management Regulations," which have regulations for managing domestically manufactured and foreign-introduced products, but unfortunately they are not strictly enforced. Unregistered and unlicensed products flood the market and sell well in various provinces, cities, counties, and towns. There are rumors that healthy horse serum is being sold as tetanus antitoxin, that plague vaccine is manufactured by killing avirulent plague bacilli, and that smallpox vaccine is not tested at all, but is highly diluted and sold. It is hoped that these are just rumors and not facts. It should not happen that products related to human life, biological products, are manufactured乱造, and the work is stolen. Private manufacturers must strictly comply with the laws and regulations, and public manufacturing organizations must also have regulations for random inspection and testing, executed or tested by the Ministry of Health. There should also be a standard and reasonable regulation on the manufacturing, testing, and application methods of various biological products, and if they are implemented conscientiously, the health of the nation will be guaranteed.

<h3>What is Common Sense? What is Esteemed by the Medical Profession?</h3>
<p>— Bridge Dweller</p>
<p>"Common sense," such a popular term, or rather, such a widespread buzzword, what exactly does it contain? To say, "So-and-so doesn't even have common sense," is as insulting as it gets. But what exactly is the content of common sense?</p>
<p>Given the complex state of modern society, the "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink" of the three hundred and sixty professions can no longer encompass everything. Moreover, each profession has its own specific developments, so the ABCs of those within the profession, that is, the basic common sense of each profession, is no longer something outsiders can fully understand. May I ask, what is "thirteen points"? What is "taking advantage of someone"? Would a "Beijing slicker" who always stays in Beijing know? May I ask, what is "radish in the twelfth lunar month"? Would a young master who always hangs out in foreign establishments know? To say that they don't even have this bit of common sense would be truly unjust!</p>
<p>In the past, Empress Wu Zetian's relative, Wu Sansi, had a—or rather, two—profound saying: "Those who are good to me are good people, and those who are not good to me are not good people." I think, in this situation of ideological divergence and mutual deception, to come up with a definition of "good" and "not good," perhaps Mr. Wu Sansi's words are the most straightforward. Everyone, I'm not just rambling in circles; I want to use this example to try to define common sense: "Basic knowledge that is useful to me is common sense, and basic knowledge that is not useful to me is not common sense." In that case, why should those proud sons of "drivers getting rich" and "hardware kings" know Confucius? The three words "Confucius" should definitely not be included in their common sense. Yet they all know Confucius; this is a waste. Why is there such a waste? For the sake of appearances! Much knowledge is for the sake of appearances, all wasted effort, strictly speaking, truly unnecessary. I regret that I know Confucius, and I regret even more that I know both Elder Dong and Elder Kang, the Dong-Kang Elders, but I don't know how to grab hats or eat plates, to the point of being so down and out. This is about general common sense.</p>
<p>Medical common sense is naturally another part within general common sense. What should we know? It's still that same phrase, and we shouldn't say "we," but only "I" or "you": "What is useful to you." If you are an old man, perhaps you will pay attention to "unparalleled virility"; if you are an athlete, perhaps you will pay attention to Vitamin B. However, nowadays, "people with common sense" don't have to be old men or athletes to pay attention to these magic weapons. As a result, almost everyone has to swallow a "multivitamin" pill every day. Undoubtedly, there is a lot of waste in this, but it seems this has also become a kind of "common sense facade."</p>
<p>Everyone, during times of frugality, it wouldn't hurt to be frugal with common sense as well; reduce a little facade, reduce a little waste. However, what is truly useful to me, what is truly useful to you, is indeed difficult to rigidly define. Even if it is objectively defined, it may still not pass subjectively. For example, I don't necessarily need to know things like "Uranium-235" at all, because it doesn't help my life at all, it can be said to be extremely useless, yet I remember it. For example, you, if you have open tuberculosis, you absolutely must avoid spreading it to others, but what percentage can do that? Smoking and alcohol are harmful, that's common sense, right, but the liquor and tobacco merchants' businesses are thriving and their wealth is abundant. Closing the door and surrounding a fire basin has the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning, also common sense, right, but a certain geologist still got carbon monoxide poisoning in the hospital. This is about medical common sense. Alas, common sense!</p>

<h3>On the Translation of Old Poetry</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>Translation is truly a laborious and thankless task. For translations that are faithful to the original work, readers often need to have a foreign language brain in order to read them without feeling a headache. If the translation is adapted to the style of Chinese language, it is inevitable that the meaning will be sacrificed for the sake of words, losing the spirit of the original work. Yan Fu's proposed highest goal of translation: faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance, is truly a difficult ideal goal to achieve; Yan Fu himself was unable to fully achieve this.</p>
<p>As someone who engages in translation work, all that can be done now is to seek an approximation to the original work within the boundaries of literal and free translation, and it is impossible to create a copy of this original work in another language. Lu Xun translated literary masterpieces, strictly advocating the method of literal translation, but I must admit that his translation of "Dead Souls" was a failure; if one doesn't read it with extreme patience, one often has to close the book halfway through. Luo Jinnan's translation of "A Tale of Two Cities," although using literal translation, seems to be much more fluent, but a friend told me that he found it very difficult to read the translation and did not finish the book. Among the translated works I have read, Mao Dun's translation of the collection of short stories of weak nations, "The Peach Garden," is a very fluent translation. Perhaps because Mao Dun's translation was based on an English translation, the wording has been refined and there are no roundabout phrases, making it easier to translate into Chinese.</p>
<p>In recent times, some have translated classical Chinese into vernacular, translating the Three Hundred Tang Poems and turning them into vernacular poems. I feel this is a waste of translation. The Three Hundred Tang Poems are representative works of various poets, with strict syntax, clean and concise, sometimes requiring no annotations at all. Why translate them into vernacular? Moreover, in contrast, these vernacular poems appear weak; those who only understand vernacular Chinese cannot appreciate their essence. And today's general intellectuals mostly have some understanding of old poetry; reading vernacular poems makes them feel like the ugly woman of Dongshi imitating the beautiful woman of Xishi. If you can write vernacular poems, just write vernacular poems. Wasting your own energy and other people's newsprint to translate such incomprehensible things, do you really want to strive to become an empty literary figure?</p>
<h3>The Japanese Crown Prince's Female Teacher</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>The education of the Japanese Crown Prince is undertaken by a woman—Elizabeth Gray Vining, a Quaker from Philadelphia—which is a first in history.</p>
<p>Before the age of twelve, Akihito, the eldest son of Hirohito, was always strongly protected from all female influences, even the influence of his own mother. He lived in a male world.</p>
<p>Since the American forces occupied the Japanese archipelago, the situation has changed. Hirohito, who changes with the wind, proposed to the court to hire an American woman with a good educational foundation and a Christian faith as his son's "tutor." After the recommendation of Dr. George Stoddard, a New York State education commissioner who inspected education in Japan, Mrs. Vining was nominated and selected. Mrs. Vining believes that her selection was due to her Quaker training and her two award-winning books for children.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vining landed in Yokohama in October 1946. Her annual salary is two thousand US dollars, plus room and board and heating. Her translator and secretary is a young Japanese woman chosen by the Imperial Household Ministry who studied in the United States for five years.</p>
<p>The Japanese Imperial Family is extremely satisfied with Mrs. Vining's performance in her first year, so they renewed her contract for another year. The scope of her influence is gradually increasing. She is now also educating Akihito's three sisters, his younger brothers, and the Japanese Empress.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vining teaches all subjects in English. One of the first things she did was teach Akihito to play tennis. She drew a diagram of the court, placed the ball, and taught him English words like "ready" and "score." These numbers are easily transferable to other things.</p>
<p>The books read by the Japanese Crown Prince emphasize the importance of cooperation. These books all tell stories of boys and girls working together.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vining was once authorized by the Imperial Household Ministry to preside over the "Peer's School," which trains Japan's future leaders, educating seventy-eight male students. This school is now wide open, and children from all walks of life can enroll as long as they pass the exam. In addition to private lessons with Mrs. Vining, Akihito is also a student at this school, which is the first time in Japan that the Crown Prince receives basic education with other boys. Mrs. Vining explained that Akihito is happy and unconstrained there, just like when he is with his parents in the palace. He usually lives and eats with his attendants at a Japanese-style location about twenty miles west of the center of Tokyo. Akihito spends most of his time with his classmates in their dormitories.</p>
<p>In addition, Mrs. Vining also teaches at the "Ladies' School." Japanese royal schools used to be segregated by gender, but now it is part of a plan to eliminate the sharp inequalities between the sexes in Japan.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Vining's work is completed, Akihito may go to the United States to study abroad. And the work of an American woman may have an unspeakable impact on the future of seventy-eight million Japanese people.</p>
<h3>The Signature of a Famous General</h3>
<p>When General Stilwell was in San Francisco, a Chinese child asked him to sign for remembrance. To show his goodwill, Stilwell signed his name in Chinese. He thought this was the proper courtesy to a Chinese child.</p>
<p>"Heaven knows!" The child grumbled after Stilwell left, "Counting it as a four-star general, I can't see what he wrote!" (Camel)</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Dao Xian</p>
<p>Hawaii is the sweetest place in the world, with 73% of its arable land planted with sugarcane. The yield per acre is as high as one hundred tons. The harvest in 1947 reached 100 million US dollars. 90% of the world's pineapples are supplied by Hawaii.</p>
<p>The population of the United States accounts for 6% of the world's population, but Americans own three-quarters of the world's cars, one-half of the radios, and more than one-half of the refrigerators. The United States consumes one-third of the world's wool, one-quarter of the cotton, one-third of the soap, and more than one-half of the rubber.</p>
<p>Fort Knox in the United States holds 892,000 gold bricks, each weighing 27 pounds, with a total value of approximately 12.5 billion US dollars.</p>
<h3>Indian Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>An experienced missionary was sent to an Indian tribe. Seeing many young men sitting in front of their huts all day, contemplating life, he intended to "therapize" them and earnestly advised them to go to the city to find work:</p>
<p>Indian (A): If I work, what good is it to me?</p>
<p>Missionary (B): You can have money! You can buy a lot of things!</p>
<p>A: Is that it?</p>
<p>B: You can be a foreman and have more money.</p>
<p>A: Is that it?</p>
<p>B: Ah! You can be a manager, if you work diligently!</p>
<p>A: If I'm a manager, what good is it to me?</p>
<p>B: If you're a manager, you'll have countless money, and you won't have to work anymore!</p>
<p>A: Heaven knows! Pale face (the Indian term for white people)! Am I not already working now? Why go to so much trouble to seek what I already have?</p>
<p>Americans row boats in the Atlantic Ocean, Indians row boats in their imaginations. Although the methods are different, the principle is the same. Americans look at the moon in the sky, eager to fly; Indians look at the moon in the sky, falling into deep sleep. From the moon, they think of the Weaver Girl, from the Weaver Girl, they think of all women, and the day passes like this. The next day, looking at the moon in the sky, they have another set of thoughts, and the year passes like this. The second year, looking at the moon in the sky, they have a set of even newer thoughts, and their whole life passes like this.</p>
<p>The Indians are undoubtedly the smartest people in the world; only they enjoy life most economically and effectively. You spent 45,000 yuan, painfully stepping into the cinema, for the sake of enjoyment. But they only need to daydream in front of their huts for free to get the same enjoyment. You watched, they thought. After watching, it's over; after thinking, it's also over. But the enjoyment is the same. Therefore, the Indians' philosophy is: if you want to make a coat, don't waste your energy borrowing from east and west; just think about wearing a coat. If you want to enjoy delicacies, don't go to a big hotel and get glared at by the waiters; just think about eating a full banquet. You only need to sit silently in a small room, thinking that you are living in those "good old days" without war or deception, eating eight yuan per dan of rice, gnawing on three copper coins for a big pancake, and you can't help but smile. If you think like this every day, think like this every year, then you are truly living in peaceful times!</p>
<p>In "emptiness" there is a golden house. In "emptiness" there are a thousand zhong of grain. In "emptiness" there is a beautiful woman. It's not that I'm encouraging you to have neurotic diseases, it's that the times are forcing you to do so.</p>
<h3>Remembering Yan Gao</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leng</p>
<p>The corruption of the Yan Gao family has been historically determined. The stories of their clever plundering and extortion will not be discussed here. According to the Tianshui Bingshan Record, when their property was confiscated, there were at least more than 5,000 items. The important ones included: more than 32,900 taels of pure gold connected to gold utensils and jewelry, more than 2,027,000 taels of pure silver connected to silver utensils and jewelry, more than 3,800 taels of pearls, precious stones, amber, coral, and other treasures, more than 14,000 bolts of damask, silk, gauze, and fur, 57 houses, mansions, shops, and estates, more than 277,000 mu of fields, and that doesn't include loans, food, livestock, utensils, etc.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this wealth is evidence of corruption, and the enormity of the numbers is astonishing. However, I am not at all surprised by this, because they held power for twenty years. Twenty years of accumulation should of course result in this "achievement." Conversely, what surprises me is: why didn't the Song Dynasty restrain them earlier at any time during their tenure, and only start calculating the old debts after Yan Gao was dismissed and bought and sold houses? What surprises me even more is: the authorities dealt with this matter, knowing that this wealth was squeezed from the people, but did not use it to return it to the victimized families. Why did they issue an imperial edict, "confiscating everything and sending it to the ministry, not allowing relatives and acquaintances to embezzle or accept it on consignment?"</p>
<p>From this deeper layer, it can be observed that the Song Dynasty had more cases of confiscating the property of corrupt officials than any other dynasty. And from Liu Jin, Qian Ning, Jiang Bin, to Yan Gao, and He Shen, all those who made great fortunes by relying on their official power ended up in the same way, and the authorities' handling methods were almost the same: "Property to the government." In the home-ruled dynasty, the government naturally belonged to the emperor personally. And the naive common people, of course, do not understand the subtleties of this.</p>
<p>Yan Song probably saw this principle, because according to the preface of the Tianshui Bingshan Record, the Old Man of Nancun said: "When Weng (Song) was dismissed from the prime ministership and returned home, he examined his private collection and saw 300,000 gold and 2 million silver, and exclaimed: "This is a disaster waiting to happen! It should be offered immediately, or hoping to avoid the trouble." But Shi Fan led the family to cry around and stopped him." It's a pity that he didn't make up his mind at the last moment, and still fell for someone else's trick!</p>
<p>I am not defending Yan Song and other corrupt officials. I am only pointing out that although Yan Song is detestable, Yan Song, and even other corrupt officials, ended up in such a situation because they fell for the "Emperor's" secret plan.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Success Falls Short (50)</p>
<p>Feng Sheng held up her index finger and said: "Second condition, we don't have to announce the divorce, just sign a private agreement with you. When I'm unhappy and want to cancel it, it must be canceled, you can't cancel it, dare you do it?" Zhu Qi nodded repeatedly and said: "This is also possible." Feng Sheng raised her middle finger again and said: "Third condition, after our divorce, you must not remarry, and I must not remarry." Zhu Qi couldn't help but chuckle and said: "According to these conditions, why do we need to divorce?" Feng Sheng said angrily: "Then you want to marry another one!" Zhu Qi was silent. Feng Sheng was extremely angry, stretched out her index finger and poked Zhu Qi on the forehead, saying: "You ungrateful thing, I knew your intentions long ago, so, you can remarry, but you have to be careful, I have the power to cancel the divorce agreement, I am the legal wife, you marry a concubine, I have the power to control her." Zhu Qi said: "Whether I marry or not is still not up for discussion, whether you have the power to control is even less up for discussion. I only ask you, are there any other conditions? If there are only these two conditions, I will agree." Feng Sheng said: "If you dare to agree, write the agreement." Zhu Qi had already prepared a draft in his stomach, and as soon as he heard her tell him to write, he immediately found paper, took out a fountain pen, and wrote it down. In less than ten minutes, two divorce agreements were written. He handed the fountain pen to Feng Sheng and said: "Please sign it!" Feng Sheng took the fountain pen, completed the signature, couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, tears rolled down, threw the pen on the table, took two quick steps and lay on the bed crying. Zhu Qi looked at her, feeling a little unbearable in his heart. He supported his head with one hand, leaned diagonally in front of the table, and hesitated in his heart, feeling that it was morally wrong to play with her like this. So he walked to the bed, gently patted Feng Sheng on the back and said: "Don't be sad, we must still maintain our feelings, I will still come to see you constantly, if you have anything, I can still try my best to help." Feng Sheng pushed Zhu Qi away and cried: "Get out of here, I won't lie, since we are divorced, what feelings are there! Don't deceive me anymore, I won't be deceived by you anymore, go! go! No need to use sweet words anymore, I have seen through your heart!" Zhu Qi was rejected by her, so he didn't say anything else. He took out five million yuan in banknotes from his pocket and placed them next to Feng Sheng's pillow, saying: "I'll give you this little money first, if it's not enough, you can notify me by phone, I'll come to see you again." Saying that, he gently patted her on the shoulder and back twice and said: "You must take care of your health, we all have our own futures." Feng Sheng was already crying like a weeping woman. Zhu Qi quietly left the room. He walked to the door and met the Zhang Ma who was serving him and instructed: "The young mistress is angry, you serve her well." Then he went outside, opened the wardrobe, packed a small suitcase with his clothes, and took it out. Zhang Ma sent him to the door and asked when he would come back. Zhu Qi said: "I'm going to Tianjin, I can't come back in the next few days." Then he hired a tricycle to the bank dormitory, settled everything, and sent an urgent telegram to Qi Wan.

<h3>Record of Humiliation</h3>
<p>— Jia Yi</p>
<p>The tram station was crowded with people, and I deeply regretted being late today. Usually, if I arrived at the station before 7:30, I would never encounter so many people squeezing to wait for the bus; it was already 7:45, and there were only 25 minutes left before class. One, two trams sped by, fully loaded with passengers, and drove past the station without stopping. I anxiously shouted, "Damn"—the word "Mom" was just about to come out, when my eyes lit up, and I caught sight of a beautiful young woman walking up to me; I quickly changed my sentence to: "This is outrageous! Why doesn't the bus stop at the station?"</p>
<p>The third bus finally stopped at the station, and the iron door of the bus was right in front of the young woman in front of me. Logically speaking, as soon as the door opened, she could step onto the bus; but in an instant, the crowd behind and on both sides rushed forward. The people on the left grabbed the hands of those on the right, blocking the people on the right; the people on the right also insisted on stepping forward with their left feet, blocking the people on the left; for a moment, they were all squeezed together, and no one could get on the bus. A great force behind me was pushing me. Normally, I might impatiently turn around and curse a few times, but at this moment, I took the opportunity to push the female passenger in front of me up. Of course, I also closely followed. She never turned her face around, and I think she was probably used to this kind of treatment when squeezing onto the bus. So I thought that in the future, if my wife wants to go out, I would rather spend more money to hire a tricycle than let her be "pushed" onto the tram.</p>
<p>The inside of the carriage was impossible to squeeze into, so I had to stay next to the driver. The driver was complaining that he couldn't drive because he was squeezed so tightly. I took the opportunity to ask him why the previous bus didn't stop at the station? The driver glanced at me and didn't say anything back.</p>
<p>It was already five minutes past eight. I would be late for school today, and it was hateful that the driver, while complaining that people were squeezing him, still stopped at every station, always allowing one or two more people to squeeze on. I saw that the young woman in front of me was really squeezed uncomfortably, so I said to the driver: "The bus is already so crowded, if no one is getting off at the station, don't stop, just drive straight ahead."</p>
<p>"Hey! What did you say just now? You cursed the first two buses for not stopping at the station. You said one thing when you were down there, and you say another thing when you're on the bus! Look at your gentleman, he seems to be knowledgeable, how—how—? Alas! This is just the temper of the Chinese."</p>
<p>The young woman turned her face to me again and smiled mockingly. She was beautiful, but at this moment I really couldn't stand it. My face was tingling and hot. I turned my eyes to look at the bus, and fortunately none of my students were on it, otherwise. I could only think of one sentence: "If rituals are lost, seek them among the barbarians" is indeed correct.</p>
<h3>Strange Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>The lawyer defended the defendant: "Please note, Your Honor, the defendant did not break into the house at all. He simply saw that the window was open, reached his right hand in, and took a few insignificant things. It must be known that the defendant's hand is not equal to the defendant himself. How can the defendant be punished for what one of the defendant's arms did?"</p>
<p>The judge said: "Your argument is very reasonable. I will now, according to your theory, sentence the defendant's arm to one year of imprisonment. Whether the defendant goes to jail with the arm can be decided at the defendant's convenience."</p>
<p>After hearing the verdict, the defendant happily removed his soft arm and walked out of the courtroom.</p>
<p>After telling a story about a little sheep who left the flock without permission and was eaten by a wolf, the teacher said to the children: "You see, if the little sheep could obey and not leave the flock, it would not have been eaten by the wolf, right?"</p>
<p>The child replied: "Teacher, that's right, then it would have been eaten by us."</p>
<p>A female salesperson walked into the home of a taciturn person and asked, "Is the wife at home?" The owner replied that she was not at home.</p>
<p>The female salesperson asked, "Can I wait for her for a while?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, please sit for a while."</p>
<p>The female salesperson waited for a full hour and couldn't help but ask, "Where did your wife go?"</p>
<p>"She went to the cemetery."</p>
<p>"May I ask when she will be back?"</p>
<p>The owner answered cautiously, "I don't know. She's been gone for eleven years."</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Tang Dingzhi</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Returning after the calamity, I threw away the pen and talked, with a hundred things on my mind and my mouth closed, yet the writing was clear and strong as before, perhaps it was still possible to extend life with illness.</p>
<p>Day after day I idled and did not move forward, I could not see him again in illness, and now I see him again weeping by the coffin, but I went to Song City to weep for Hui Lian.</p>
<p>In broad daylight I could glimpse the monsters passing, when I saw Cao Xiang, what could you do! Not knowing the difference between yesterday and today, the living and the dead are separated, which place has more ghosts!</p>
<p>Sages and sages all die after a hundred years, and Xin Qing is gone, and Tao Yi is also gone, but you and I were born in the same year, what sorrow is there for short and long lives! The misery of the masses has not yet dissipated, of life and death it is all boring! Cherish the writings of the good son, and do not scatter and burn the remaining scraps.</p>
<h3>Retention Fee</h3>
<p>— Yan Ping</p>
<p>The winter vacation is almost upon us. Although the holiday has not yet started, parents are already feeling serious distress and worry about their children's education. The semester's academic report cards have not yet been seen, but they are first greeted with a notice demanding a "retention fee."</p>
<p>The retention fee seems to have become a "legitimate and justified" item. The school uses the excuse that the number of places is limited, and in order to favor existing students, those who pay the retention fee can keep their place; otherwise, new students will be recruited to make up the difference, so as not to reduce income. In reality, I think it's nothing more than using the name of "retention fee" to send out a batch for expenses. Especially at the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, parents only want their children to have an education, and they won't quibble over a small retention fee, especially since the notice states that "those who fail to pay by the deadline will be treated as new students"?</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, the authorities issued an order prohibiting the collection of "retention fees." However, orders are just orders, and reality is reality! Some say that this order only applies to public schools, and private schools are not bound by it. In that case, doesn't the principle of "education regardless of public or private" suffer a blow?</p>
<p>If "retention" is a necessary procedure for studying, why must a "fee" be collected? And why does its amount have to be more than one-tenth of the tuition fee?</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, why not change the word "fee" to "note" or "letter," and at the start of the vacation, have parents issue an application form or the like, guaranteeing that their children will definitely not transfer schools next semester, and ask the school to register their place. In this way, the school can use the number of people retaining their place as a basis for management, budgeting, enrollment, etc., "benefiting both sides, public and private." I wonder what the education authorities think?</p>
<p>"The thing I love most about George is that he is always so calm and unhurried under pressure."</p>
