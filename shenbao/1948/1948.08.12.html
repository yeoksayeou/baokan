<h3>美權威方面預料　共和黨明年如執政　將加強軍事援華　美陸長對我國軍事表示樂觀</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕權威方面十日預料，中國將於明年正月間充分運用一億二千五百萬美元之美國軍事援助。屆時如由共和黨執政，中國將提出增加援助款項，以打擊共黨之新要求。彼等幷認為，如果由共和黨執政，極可能將較民主黨政府撥付更多援華基金。果爾，則新計劃將依照援助土耳其與希臘之計劃，派遣「指導員」在戰場指導軍隊，此事頗有希望。觀察家相信，現雖有跡象表示杜魯門政府在若干時日之拖延後，已加速援華，但為切合實際起見，對華仍須於二項政策中擇取其一。一為全方援助中國國民政府，此項政策係為國會在參議員勃里奇及衆議員員以德領導下所贊成者。另一為杜魯門政府之政策，即予以援助而規定此項援助不為國民政府之政策負責。據勃里奇所稱：「現政府在過去數年內所採取之對華政策，無論如何不能稱為兩黨政策」。勃氏復謂，渠希望政府已開始進行一新政策，此事如果屬實，則杜魯門政府已為國會行動所督促。杜魯門方面則稱，軍事援華計劃「不應視作美政府有負責於巾國之政策·行動·任務，或甲國任何時期所發生之情形等之假定」。杜氏此言為靈通人士所認為殊屬重要，蓋此語表示美政府對中國國政仍有保留，使勃里奇及國會其他人士深信援華計劃可有價值者，乃數月前魏德邁中將向參議院及衆議院秘密會議中所提出之報吿。魏氏之「方案」包括美國更積極訓練中國軍隊。傳陸長罷雅爾對中國政府軍可獲勝利之希望現日益樂觀。自七月廿三日以來，中國曾購買九百萬美元之美國武裝部隊之軍事物資。但靈通方面指出巾國在獲取其所需之飛機汽油方面，現仍有困難。據云阻礙乃在商務部之出口執照管理處。蓋商務部至今尚朱發表七·八·九三月之中國分配數量。但本年度一·二·三月內給中國之航空用汽油數量為六萬桶，四·五·六三月內增為十六萬桶。</p>
<p>雖則此援華計劃為特別立法會議所製定，然航空汽油及其他石油產品之運輸，皆歸商務部出口管理處辦理。商務部對七，八，九月之分配數量不能及時發表一點，聲明其理由為美國國內之需要也日見增加。據稱：各國之需要日益增加，汽油出口如何分配，須由政府最高當局決定。</p>

<h3>港幣貶值的徵兆</h3>
<p>最近英國政府限制香港的貿易，曾先後採取兩項措置：一項是自七月二十日起，倫敦與香港之間的英鎊滙款，均以五百鎊為限：另一項是自八月三日起，凡因出口貨物而獲得的外滙利益，均應以官價折合，讓與香港政府；但出口至美國，菲律濱，澳門，朝鮮，日本，中國以及英鎊區域者，不在此限·因此，香港的遠東經濟評論報撰論，預料香港可能退出英鎊區域。其所根據的理由是；「香港退出英鎊區域之後，不論對目前或將來，都是有利的：多數經濟觀察家認為香港在事實上，僅為一大海港，不應該包括在英鎊區城之內。而且現在香港的貿易已逐漸减少，為維持香港的繁榮計，實不應該於此時加以任何限制。」</p>
<p>英國政府限制香港貿易的措置是否合理？香港退出英鎊區域是否可能？我們對這些問題姑置勿論，但無論如何，我國國內若干視香港為樂國的豪富們總可以從迷夢中覺醒過來了吧！戰後香港的繁榮，完全是一種畸形的發展，港幣的偏高，更是我國內少數投機商人所一手造成的。華南各地的情形不必說，卽以上海一地而論，不法商號私套港滙的，眞是多如過江之鯽，雖經警局經濟警察大隊迭次破獲，但仍是「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」，前天又破獲七家商號，套滙總額竟達十萬億以上，駭人聽聞·雖被捕的二十七人，均將移交特種刑庭處理，而那些視香港為樂土的商人，恐還未必因此而有所警覺·我們眞不明白，那些財迷商人會糊塗到此地步，卽使不為國家着想，也得為本身利益打算打算，為什麼要以身試法私套英國政府所不取的港幣？請問資金逃避到香港就能保持幣值了嗎？利令智昏，竟昏到這種地步，不僅忘了國家利益，而且連自己的利益也不知打算，真使我們大惑不解！</p>
<p>有人說：「香港政府發行紙幣，也有十足的英鎊率備金，目前香港的貿易卽使尚嫌不足，但香港對外國的收支仍能保持平衡。」這種說法，在頭腦單純的商人總來，也許以為言之成理：但由我們看來，對於港幣的行將貶值。無異於不打自招。</p>
<p>第一，港幣發行的總額，港政府從未公佈，我們自然不得而知：但有各種跡象，足資徵信，港幣的膨脹也已到了相當的程度，僅以外流在華南各地的港幣而論，為數已經可觀。假如港幣的發行確有十足的英鎊準備金，試問英國政府為什麼要限制倫敦與香港之間的滙款呢？英國政府深恐港幣的膨脹連累到英鎊，不是顯而易見的了嗎？</p>
<p>第二，我國工商界人士，因為看到國內戰亂的擴大與持久，紛紛作其所謂「自保之計」，擁有資金的，固然不惜以身試法，私套港滙，將資金逃避到香港，就是開有工廠或商店的，也千方百計，準備南遷至港，頓使香港人口激增，工廠林文，造成空前的畸形繁榮，對於港幣籌碼的需要旣已大增，港幣當也不免增加發行。但是香港是一個轟爾小島，市民所需的糧食，工廠所需的原料，無一不須仰給於港外，故欲長久保持對外收支的平衡，自然不是一件輕而易舉的事情·假如港府確能保持對外收支的平衡，試問英國政府為何要香港的出口商將其所得外滙照官價折合讓與香港政府呢？</p>
<p>基於上述的分析，以乎可以斷定香港潛伏在內層的危機，也非常嚴重。有遠見的英國人士對於此種危機，早已有所戚覺：將來香港不論仍在英鎊區域內或是退出英鎊集團，港幣的貶值，總是不可避免的了。凡是有資金逃避在香港的豪富，或是已將工廠南遷至港的廠商，過去或能徉洋得意，自以為手法高人一等，但現在應該可以恍然大悟了吧！資金逃避或工廠南遷，不僅已損害及我國經濟的健康，而且最終的結果，連自身的利益恐亦將不保。你們還能說香港是你們的桃花源嗎？</p>
<h3>改革幣制須慎重　急務在監督發行　潘公展在時事座談會中發表意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕時事評論社昨假市銀行四樓召開時事座談會。潘公展，何西亞，祝百英，李宗文，魏友棐，莊智煥，方秋韋等均參加。由主編潘世傑，衛一萍主持。座談會於晚間八時開始，至九時牛結束，論題以挽救法幣危機為中心，潘公展對幣制改革力主愼重，認為在財政收支不平衡狀熊下，改革必為失敗，徒然引起紛擾。當務之急為嚴格監督發行，財政上之赤字決不再以發行手段彌補，如此經濟情勢方有轉機，財政部之發行權，必須予以收回。抵補赤字之道有三：（一）增加國營事業收入，（二）改善稅收方法，在目前之制度，稅收之眞正入國庫者，尚不足牛數，為適應我國實情起見，不妨開倒車，採用包稅制度，反見實惠。（三）出售賠償物資，剩餘物資，敵偽產業及國營事業。潘氏並認為今日任財長官，首應有不增發通貨，而能應符財政支出之把握，否則大可不必戀棧。祝百英，李宗文等相繼發言，均主張今後發行必須獨立，即使財政收支上尚有有限之赤字，亦須經過法定之手續，向中央銀行借貸，一切按銀行原則辦事，方可納入正軌。又目前之各種經濟改革方案，在政府考盧中者，為數甚多，外界亦對之作種種推測，謠言孔多，其實大原則及方案之決定，如能採公開討論之方式遠較秘密議定為有益。</p>

<h3>日應賠償數量　遠在美援之上　某專家促國人勿忽視</h3>

<h3>小史達林的幕後生活（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯　（原文載八月十七日出版的美國〔觀察雜誌〕）</p>
<p>戀女色放浪形骸</p>
<p>伐雪萊留在前綫幾個月以後，一定要變得憂悶，暴躁，脾氣惡劣。於是他往往托詞赴莫斯科作短期旅行。在那裏他有一羣導演，優伶和電影攝影師，隨時準備跟他胡鬧廝混，酗酒酣歌和其他撤野的尋樂。他在莫斯科有一位知交，叫做卡門，是一位電影攝影師，又是一位風雅的人物。他懂得調製中國菜餚，雞尾酒，和其他特種飲料。伐雪萊對於這些東西大為賞識。然而，當卡門娶一年輕美貌女郎姐尼亞時，找雪萊立刻愛上了她，把她帶到前綫去。</p>
<p>這一小事件却是伐雪萊的許多桃色新聞中時間最長的一件。被他蹂躪的女子簡直不勝枚舉：有波爾曉劇塲裏的舞孃，電影女明星和舞台坤伶，漂亮的女書記和許多偶爾邂逅的美貌姑娘。他把她們帶到郊外的別墅裏，在那裏他們可以放浪形骸，盡情取樂，而不受八們的干擾。</p>
<p>伐雪萊在莫斯科時常有惟我獨尊之概。有一天他挾了一個紅舞星坐汽車進城，那汽車在牛路上拋了錨。他不慌不忙把第一輛駛來的汽車攔戰下來，湊巧這汽車的主人是一位副部長，他不管一切，聲明他是伐雪萊，史達林，把汽車裏的乘客一齊逐出，載着他的情婦揚長而去了。</p>
<p>又有一次，他在另一女子的房聞裏，想打電話給一個朋友，恰巧還位朋友正和另一人在講話。他搖了兩次還是接不通，就命令那女接綫生把他們的話綫切斷，竟遭她拒絕了。激怒了的伐雪萊便大聲咆哮道：「你知道誰在和你講話嗎？我是史達林。明天準停你生意。」他的恐嚇眞的兌了現，那女接綫生終於被辭退了。</p>
<p>受父責本性難移</p>
<p>關於他兒子的種種胡鬧，在酒鐘菜館裏的醜行，被他悔辱的女子以及其他種種奇聞逸事，自有特務人貧隨時報告史達林，這是毫無疑問的。但是要制止他的撒野行為。却是非常困難的。甚至在伐雪莢娶妻以後，還是不能使他安靜下來。雖然生男育女，再加上他父親的嚴厲的訓戒，他却本性難改，胡鬧如故。他的父親也知道他有時醉了不免滔滔不絕，發出不平之嗚，如云：「四周圍的情形委實太悽慘了……究竟到什麼時候我們能使每個人足衣足食呢？」</p>
<p>史達林明知他兒子的荒唐，但始終很關心他的幸福和他的前途。到了一九四六年初，年邁的大元帥終於簽署了那道擢升伐雪萊為將軍的命令，俾使伐雪萊即使在他父親死後，仍得保持特殊的地位。</p>
<p>無產階級出浪子</p>
<p>史達林的女兒斯維蘭娜，現在二十四歲，嫁給一個溫文有禮的工程師，他在計劃委員會裏做事，沒有資格担任政府要職的。這樣可使她更加安全些，過着平靜的生活。史達林愛她甚於其他孩子。他不但以汽車和充斥於克里姆林商店和伙食房裏的種種吃的和用的好東西無限制供給她，而且偶爾也答應她涉及政治問題的請求。</p>
<p>斯維蘭娜早年喪母（一九三二年），性格比她哥哥伐雪萊敏感，是在孤獨中畏大起來。她潛心研究音樂，她最心愛的鋼琴名曲大都抒寫憂鬱和孤獨的。</p>
<p>史達林的長子雅谷勃生下時，史達林還很年輕，其妻斯凡妮子死於一九〇七年。史達林續娶以後因熟愛繼室亞麗呂伐並全神貫注於新家庭，漸忘懷於長子雅谷勃。因此雅谷勃異當妒忌，憤然回到故鄉喬治亞，担任一個不重要的職位。</p>
<p>史達林的三個子女證明了那條老的眞理，即「非常人物難得有非常兒女。」但是伐雪萊部證明了一條新的眞理，即「無產階級的獨裁者也會出浪子。」（完）</p>

<h3>胡信義經營金鈔案　澈查證據出人意料　巨型保險箱　啓視無一物</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黑市金鈔巨魁胡信義，自經特刑庭檢察官提起公訴後，日內即將開庭審訊。惟該案中有一神秘之保險箱，迄今尚未開啓，根據六月廿九日警局從江西中路三三一號胡信義所設之吉泰紗號密室中抄擭之當日成交草帳，載朋已成交之金條數字計八十餘條，當時承辦員警見該號內有一巨型保險箱，咸推測其中必藏有大批金條，即擬將該箱加以開啓，但胡稱此箱係某機關負賣人所有，未便擅開，承辦員警為鄭重起見，當即加貼封條於箱上。胡被捕後，警局徇某金融界巨頭之請，當夜准予交保釋放，惟翌日仍遭傳案扣押，此後移解特刑庭偵查起訴，迄今為止，此神秘之保險箱始終未予開啓。該案發生後，與胡案有關係之案件亦陸續揭發，警局為澈底明瞭案情起見，商准特刑庭後，昨日下午四時，警局會同某機關代表，胡之辯護律師李晋芳，田長李伯鈞，曁吉泰紗號負賣人賴聲起等，前往該號共同啓視此神秘保險箱，詎封條揭處，箱門啓開，內中竟空空如也，衆信此一巨型精緻之保險箱，決非為裝飾品之用，其中必藏有貴重物品，今其中竟空無所有，愈益可疑。據事後警局經警大隊長程義寬表示：渠有充分證據，可以證明胡之經營黑市金鈔種種事實，保險箱中雖空無一物，但不能掩飾其罪行云。</p>

<h3>公用事業價漲　生活指數隨昇　工業界受雙重打擊　無法維持焦頭爛額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕八月份各公用事業售價空前猛漲，本月上半月生活指數將大受影饗，工業界經此聲重打擊，均感無法維持。記者昨走訪本市某工業家，據其談稱：公用事業及戶口配給米漲價數倍，致使生活指數跟蹤上昇，是為必然之理。其直接與間接對工廠之威脅甚為嚴重，在目前惡性通貨膨服之大循環中，工業製成品之漲價速率已日漸追不上原料開支等增加之速度，於是資力餃薄弱之工廠，為維持其生存，不得不將製成品貶值傾銷，此舉無異飮鴆止渴，作慢性自殺，同時較有資力之工廠，亦因此蒙受不少損害。渠認為生活指數對物價之上漲，幷非本要因素，蓋指數係根據物價而產生。對公用事業之高倍數漲價，彼認為政府措施失當。幷謂：即使公司確實虧累，亦態徐徐調整，而不應突然由「虧累」而漲達「盈餘」，因公用事業之漲價，直援刺激整個市塲與全市市民生活，彼對此次參議會之主張，極表擁護，且希望有良好成就。</p>

<h3>英商電車人員互毆　審結定十八日宣判　雙方證人各執一詞　焦點集中衣上血跡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市英商電車公司預備班售票員舒貴鄕，於六月二十日晨，不服車務處派班吳理君之調派，以鋁製票箱對吳擲攀，致吳之左眼角受傷，經吳報吿代理車務總管理麥特生（英籍），當將舒開除。翌日舒率多人前往麥之辦公室理論，與麥發生言語衝突，途致動武，結果互有傷跡。事後引起電車職工，一罷工，旋麥·舒兩人，同時具狀地檢處互控傷害，經檢察官一併依傷害罪，提起公訴。該案昨在地院刑八庭，由謝志英推事開審。並傳雙方證人劉學賽·王金生·楊鵬生·孫榮生·王距福·王繼平·糜文良·孫根生·周貴遜·劉松岐·章踢圭·胡鏡蓉·樹廷和·軋而斯登·及電車工會理事長仇長江等十餘人到庭應訊，其他職工到庭旁聽者甚多。首傳舒貴鄉供稱：「派班與我有隙，不依次序輪派。我不願，派班即疾言厲色，駡我是「吃糞的」，是「猪　」，我在氣憤之下，寗願不做生意，乃將票箱擲去，不意將其誤傷」。麥特生供稱：「舒不遵守公司規則，我奉侖開除他，可是還叫他到辦公室申訴，但舒不到，才開除他的。翌日舒一人先到我辦公室，另有多人在壓外相候，舒進屋後，即對我破口大罵，橫加悔辱，我知其來意不善，擬走出暫避其鋒，舒即將我褲帶拉住，對我胸部毆擊，至電梯口，舒復毆我頭部」。舒繼供：「我進屋申訴時，麥特生恃英人勢力，氣勢汹汹，我無說話餘地，他先打我一拳，我拉他褲帶，因他已把我頭部打破想逃，我的號衣全是血跡，同時，軋爾斯登助他擲我雙手。當時僅軋爾斯登一個證人在塲，今天到庭之其他資方證人，全係受指使而來」。工會理事長仇長江陳述：此事發生後，工會認是勞勞糾紛，有權調解，吳理君與研貫鄉兩人，均已接受調解，惟麥仍堅持將舒開除，實違反公司數十年來之往例。庭上繼詢麥特生方面之證人孫榮生，王亞福，軋而斯登等十一人，均以堅決口吻答稱，舒確曾打麥耳光，至於舒身上之血跡，從何而來，則不得而知。舒貴卿方面之證人劉學　等數人，亦以同樣口吻答稱：確見軋而斯登曾抓住舒手，並看見舒衣上，染有血跡。黃浦分局便衣警石學珊稱：「打是打的，當特因不在塲，誰打誰查不出來」。至此庭七審訊焦點，集中於舒衣上之血跡，對雙方翻覆詢問，已見端倪。旋由蒞庭檢查官起立陳述起訴意旨，律師辯讓一過後，庭上宣吿辯論終結，定本月十八日宣判。</p>

<h3>醞釀期的浙江土地改革</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>〔本報杭州九日訊〕陳公治氏來也浙政已一月，陳氏下車伊始，就對記者談施政方針，說是確保治安和增加生產。一個月來，在陳氏的新政巾，除了公文改革巳見諸事實外，對於所謂二大施政方針，還滯留在「只聞樓梯響」的地步。其實，這兩項基本方針，也正是前任主席沈成章氏想做，曾做，而沒有做好的。陳氏對浙江的新猷，眞正對浙江人民的新　，倒是祝在醞釀巾的土地改革運動。</p>
<p>今日浙江全雀所以造成藜　遍野，鄉村囂擾不安的現象，我們固然不能否認有極大的政治因素，但若客觀地分析起來，則農村經濟的衰落，（或甚至近於崩潰）和　農生活的不得保障，實是主要的關鍵。這，陳主席也是看得很明白的，他所以主張經濟建設，增加生產，就是想用繁榮地方經濟，安定人民生活來遏止亂源，這不消說是治本的辦法。但是單靠那些有計劃無經費的經濟建設，是遠水救不得近火的，最根本的辦法，還是國父所揭　的「平均地權一。浙江是農衆省，農民問題（亦即土地問題），應該得到它合理的解決。</p>
<p>方案內容　迄未透露</p>
<p>其實，浙江省政府對於農民問題是一向很注意的，對於如何施用土地，合理分配佃農與地主的利益，較諸他省有更大的努力。「二五」减租，就是浙江第一個實施的，經過二十年來的努力，全省巳普遍實施二五减租了。（這也是今日浙江治安較鄰近各省為優的重要原因之一。）但是在今日的局面下，想單靠二五减租來安定農村是不够的，所以陳主席在七月十六日晚上的第一次記者招待會上談到農村經濟問題的時候，他就表示將試辦溫和的土地改革，實施是項改革的方案，已交由地政局擬定，但是到令日還沒有批定，，而且省政府對此項方案內容，始終保守秘密。這，外界有二種看法：一是陳主席辦事謹愼，一是恐怕得罪地主，引起地方勢力的反對。</p>
<p>四大原則　保持溫和</p>
<p>陳氏的土地改革究竟將溫和到怎樣的程度呢？雖然可由該方案的四大原則則去看取：（一）辦理土地的契約登記，根據登記，澈底實施二五减租，保障佃農利益。（二）限定個人與團體土地所有之最高頭，逾額土地，概由政府征購，轉手售讓佃農。（三）不在地主之土地，荒地等其他土地，或因佃農申請代購者，或因不遵照政府規則合法施用土地者，由政府依法征購，轉議佃農。（四）由政府利由大量荒地，海塗，舉辦自耕合作農塲，招貧農和佃農前往墾植。而此項原則的前提條件為：（一）合法的進行改革，（二）不損害業主權益。</p>
<p>整理地籍　趕辦登記</p>
<p>我們且不談其程度的够不够，祗要政府肯下決心做，而且迅速地切實地做，這就很好了。談到做，首先遇到的難題是政府手里並沒有全省土地所有權的名單，不知道究竟誰有多少田。這是地籍整理問題。中央核撥浙江整理地籍的測量經費，每年祗能供五十畝之用，而全省有田一萬五千萬畝，換句話說，要三百年才能辦好土地測量。因此，祗能地方自籌，而中央又禁止田賦附加帶征，在這樣雙重的鉗制中，辦理地籍確實困難。幸而浙江的地政局長洪季川氏，是一個有遠見，有魄力的能幹的人，他從民意機關想辦法，經過省·縣·參議會的同意，在賦谷上帶征地籍整理費，（這經過去年全國地政會議的討論，中央已允為各省地方的單行法了。）三年來，總算已辦了二十一縣，加上戰前戰時已辦的二十縣，共達四十一縣。比起各省來，雖已是輝惶的成績，但與需要的程度，相去猶遠。因此怎樣在測量完竣，土地登記未辦的縣份趕辦登記，在地籍未整理的各縣，趕速完成土地登記，乃是地政局當前的新課題。而這，關鍵在乎和地方人士切實合作，與基所政治的健全。祇要基層政治健全，那些身為地主的或有產的鄉鎭保甲長，能目光放遠，協力推行，則很容勿辦。不過中國政治上的人事牽制，往往是這類事的致命傷。</p>
<p>深入民間　宣導調查</p>
<p>最近陳主席決定在各縣市設置宣導員，深入民衆，宣導政令。我覺得如果陳主席有土地改革勢在必行的決心現勇氣的話，正可以趁這些宣導人員深入農村的每一角落，直接向種田人（主要的是佃農）調查土地所有者。土地改革旣是為扶助佃農，替佃農想辦法的，那麼調查必可順利進行，迅速收效了。至於最高限額的擬定，固應視土質之豐饒與貧疥決定之，所以問題倒不在硬性的規定十畝二十畝，而在乎先有一種正確的調查。否則，地主還是可用以豐報療的手段，來自私地保存其地產的。</p>
<p>其次，是基金問題。政府徵購地主的產業，必須預備一筆龐大的基金，而且事實上佃農無力一次購取土地，必須讓他們可以分期付款的方式來購置地產。又：舉辦自耕合作農塲，亦需要龐大的經費，因此這一筆基金是相當龐大的，必須用發行土地公債或其他方式來籌措。</p>
<p>吳興等縣　先行試辦</p>
<p>最後，關於土地改革的實施，省府已決定先在一區的吳興·長興·德淸·祟德·桐鄉·嘉與·嘉善·平湖·海寗·海鹽及其他治安情形良妤，而地籍整理辦理較為完善的縣份先行試辦。據記者個人觀察：土地改革的目的，旣在扶助佃農，消滅貧農，使其成為自耕農，以遏止亂源，而最大的亂源却在治安較差，匪患最烈的山區貧瘡縣份。因此，要遏止亂源，要安定農村，似乎應該先從治安情形堪慮的縣份和貧農個農較多的縣份做起才好。</p>
<p>總之，陳主席的溫和的土地改革計劃，是他底新政由對浙江人民的一件大貢獻，全浙江的種田的農民們正翹首　望着這一可喜的遠景。</p>

<h3>央行運到大量現鈔　限制提現辦法取消　銀根走勢微緊行局有差進</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行前以本市現鈔奇缺，持　定同業提現，槪以存款總額十分之一為限，此項辦法，曾於九日試行一日，結果證明事實上困難甚多，行莊對客戶之提現，尤為苦於願付。頃悉：央行已運到大量現鈔，故此項限制提現之辦法，已吿取消。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日銀根走勢微緊，四行二局一庫於銀錢業票據交換中，雖大都差出，然因中央銀行有三六五七二億之差進，故平均仍吿差進一四九〇三億。中國銀行差出五七九四億，交通銀行差出七九七九億，農民銀行差出二四四三億，中信局差出五九八一億，郵匯局差出一五九〇億，中央合作金庫差進二一一八億，商業行莊大交換差出一九七五億，小交換差出五四六四億，外商銀行共計差進一〇卅二〇億。</p>
<h3>食米漲勢加劇　白粳重叩五千萬高價</h3>
<p>食米續見挺升，且漲勢較前為力，因迎日其他物價之上漲，遠較食米為多，人心本已極為堅昂，加以錫市勁升，貨主極力扳特，早市曾見挺升四五百萬元，白粳重叩五千萬，薄稻達五千三百萬，浦東新粳亦高達五千萬。臨收因業外各物下疲，人心轉虛，去路亦呆，收市回跌二百萬元。昨日甫北二市登記到貨有六四一八石。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>初升後回，晨開繼隔日漲勢之餘風，市仍堅倘不已，貨主繼續扳抬，老車晨市曾開一千九百萬元，嗣因業外谷物下降，納戶轉稀，收市退低至一千八百十萬元。兵船收市一千七百八十萬，較上日挺升五六十萬元。麩皮勁升百十萬，小包麩皮下午廠盤達一千萬，小麥廠盤二千四百萬開出。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>挺升，因客帮納胃仍濃，貨主繼續扳俏，以早市人心較堅，收市乃亦轉軟。黃豆受客帮光顧者，加二百萬，新黃豆祗銷本街，市乏榮象，苞米加升百萬，元麥汕帮已止進，北帮仍不停手，仍挺一百萬元。菉豆·蠶豆各在貨主之扳高下，升二百萬，芝蔴底薄，白蔴升四五百萬，元蔴挺近千萬元，生仁廣帮化懈，略砌二百萬元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>轉入平途，早開雖仍見續昂，但以價高本街縮手，更以業外各物俱見回平，散戶心虛吐售，豆油由一四〇〇〇萬，退至一三四〇〇萬收市，微修百萬元，生菜油平平之象，生油交易平淡，略加百萬，小車蔴油無榮辱。豆餅交易蘭珊，去路淸淡，反挫二三十萬。</p>
<h3>外銷茶買氣濃</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，繼承上日之倘風，又以輸出商買氣依然濃郁，執主贓價漫無止境，是以潛勢迭露秀態，行情續再光芒四射。惟查交易，則因各貨產存兩稀，遂仍缺乏豐采。惟悉：本年度祁門紅茶，自安徽茶葉公司及震和茶棧積極向產區搬運以來，聞不久即將重行蒞滬。他若婺屯大帮等，本市茶商亦擬向產地趕運，以屬實需云。</p>
<h3>結滙證明書　售價又高漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕結匯匯證明書昨日售價又漲，自六〇五萬開盤後，即直綫上昇而過七百萬大關，後以商人逢高拋出，復回至六八〇萬左右。</p>
<p>官方表示結匯證之漲價，由於進口商之需求大，而與官方無關。又邇來結匯證明書之漲價，對僑匯亦有相當刺激作用，據祁匯總局方面消息，七月份僑匯之收入，較六月份幾增一倍。</p>
<h3>內滙率調整</h3>
<p>四行兩局一庫內匯率十二日起，調整如次二廈門四〇〇元，福州三〇〇元，泉州四〇〇元，廣州四〇〇元，柳州梧州南寗各二五〇元，連雲港七〇元，叙府萬縣各四五〇元，南昌一八〇元，九江一八〇元，吉安贛州各二五〇元，海門臨海各一〇〇元，雲南四〇〇元。</p>

<h3>棉價漲運費貴　紗廠無力採購</h3>
<p>陝棉豐收富戶囤存量尤夥</p>
<p>據悉：陝棉七月一日為徵作軍用，禁止外運後，當由政府指定中紡公司及棉統會，供給三萬六千担，農民銀行供給四千担，共計四萬担，於半個月內即全部收齊，故目前陝棉已重行開放外運，迄今已絡續運出一千五百餘噸，惟在陝棉再度開放外運後，遭遇之困難刦較以往為多。</p>
<p>（一）陝棉在六月底之售價，每担為九千三百萬元，開放後每拒突暴漲至二億一千萬元，此外由寳雞運至重慶，其運費每噸為三億八千萬，由重慶運來上海，其運費亦甚鉅，如此陝棉運來上海後，其售償將較滬市之棉花價格為昂，致刺激滬市花價，各紗廠現均無力量售進。</p>
<p>（二）最近運出之一千五百餘噸，運至重慶後，突被重慶市政府下令扣留，其理由為重慶缺乏棉花，本市棉花業公會以重慶市政府此種舉動，實屬違法，頃已向當地提出嚴重抗議，交涉發還，並盼以後不再有類似之情事發生。</p>
<p>（三）陝西之富戶國存之棉花極多，約有二十萬祖左右，不願出售，需保存至十月間收購新棉後，再行出售。陝省當局對此等囤戶，亦無適當處置。綜合以上種種實際困難，陝棉運滬，前途尚難樂觀。</p>
<p>又陝棉今年確為豐年，總產量可達一百廿萬担，較去年為多，若能大量採運來滬，各紗廠可無棉荒之虞云。</p>
<h3>棉紗市氣回軟　布疋籌碼充斥交易轉懈</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因運朝飛揚，客商均嫌價格太貴，納胃轉呆，更以業內頭寸軋緊，浮多相繼脫售，致市氣回軟，人心亦虛。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開時聞龍頭細布價續挺秀，人心堅昂，喊價仍俏。開後以圈外各物回降，塲內賣戶較多，終以廿八億五千萬現出，八千萬明日出結束，比上日·回跌一億餘萬元。其他各支粗細紗，亦均回低二三千萬至一成左右，成交一百二十件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因市上銀根轉緊，兼聞民營廠家開出頗多，籌碼頓覺充沛，場內經警密佈，交易轉稀。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，晨時承隔日之餘威，上竄二百餘萬，並以銀根仍鬆，交易鼎盛，中途市盤再高至七千九百五十萬有成交，迨至十點鐘後，聞股票及紗市疾退，北帮突來轉賣，大戶及浮多獲利吐售，場內費氣頓濃，市勢驟吿疲軟，卒以七千七百五十萬元收盤，但較上日仍步挺二百七十萬元，（比上日塲外軋降一百五十萬。）</p>
<p>又訊：午後漲勢又强，業外物資亦升，龍頭細布喊價重出八千萬大關，再創八千一百萬之新高峰，較上午軋升三百五十萬元，四君子元嗶嘰比午收亦倘三百五十萬元。</p>
<p>此外五福喇叭童等中檔細布，價亦步挺一百五六十萬至二百五十萬，色布及士林布受染料上漲之刺激，高檔貨提升達一千五百萬之鉅，其餘各布市亦堅俏。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡昨代紗管會干棉紗市場拋售棉紗七種，准購三十一戶，拋售一二四件，價值二一，五四七，〇〇〇萬。又中紡昨發出准購證四〇五張，售棉紗六〇二件，合廿支紗一三七七又半件，價值一五，一〇八億元。</p>
<h3>本月份貨物稅激增　全月可達十萬餘億</h3>
<p>據貨物稅局負責人稱：自本市財政局加强稅收以來，貨物稅收大有進步，即八月份截至昨日止，已達八萬四千餘億，較上月份全部所收增四萬餘億。其中捲烟稅一項，所收約達三萬餘億，幾佔全部稅額三分之一，預料月終可達十萬餘億，對本市財政不無補益，又因物價之不斷上升，九月份貨物稅之數字，將更形龐大</p>
<p>又訊：央行國庫局息：直接貨物兩稅局，業經合併為國稅局，茲經財部規定，所有原撥各區直貨兩稅局之本年七至九月之經補各費，准由各該局將已撥而尚未提用各款，開具公庫支票，移交同一區域之國稅局接收，概以國稅局名義立戶，繼續支用。</p>
<h3>棉布公會召開　會員代表大會</h3>
<p>本市棉布商業同業公會經理監事聯席會議議決，定於本月二十八日下午，假座福州路中央菜社，召集第三次會員代表大會，改選半數理監事，討論該業重要議案。並遵照上海市社曾團體，召開代表大會暨選舉辦法之規定，先行分區召開預備會，推選出席代表。並定於本月十六日起至二十三日止，每日下午假座同一地點，就該會原劃定之地域分區舉行，聞該會全體會員代表為二千五百餘人，照社會局頒行辦法之規定，可產生出席代表一百二十餘人，席次不多，競選者頗不乏人云。</p>
<h3>放寬僑資輸入尺度　輸管會建議兩點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會息：自獎勵僑資輸入辦法公佈後，官方曾徵求工商界之意見，頃悉輸管會已依據工業界之申請，提出兩點修祝辦法，呈請政院核准。</p>
<p>修正辦法為：（一）准許僑資輸入之原料，必須與國內廠家之需求相配合，即國內生產機構得直接與國外僑資訂立合同，經主管機關之許可，直接運交國內生產事業，使供需相應。</p>
<p>（二）僑資所輸入之國幣資金原料，用以建立新廠者，為顧及事實起見，將限期自六個丹延長至一年。以上僑資回國尺度之放寬，可增加國內物資之供應，並可達成鼓勵生產之目的。</p>
<h3>國藥上揚</h3>
<p>近因港匯關係，成本頗受影饗，市價一致上揚，荳蔻各檔高升，貢蔻一千四百萬元，一號揀蔻一千萬元，二號揀蔻九百萬元，頂紫蔻七百五十萬元，原荳蔻六百萬元。金印硃竭四千二百萬，三頂三千八百萬元，雙頂二千四百萬元，頂血竭一千六百萬元，上血竭六百萬元。淸甲片四百八十萬，東芍王一千萬至六百萬，玄胡四百萬至一百六十萬，京河車市開卅萬，均創空前新高價。</p>

<h3>中途一度疲軟　華股臨收復高</h3>
<p>華股昨初疲後俏，顧慮之處較多，紗布晨市回瀉，近午跌勢悽慘，小股更見不利。港電報新低價，面目一新，臨收復高，華豐等漲停。</p>
<p>晨初旣承前收餘風，復有鉅鈔之傳，上塲尚平，永紗以一五六五〇元上場，小股則開低居多，抵用辦法不能通融，美貸加緊談判，一五二號一七九號一七六號二二號一〇二號七六號賣到一五三五〇元，一四一號二二〇號四五號一二號六五號二〇五號二二四號六〇號五四號二〇七號尚具買胃，抬高到一五九五〇元新高價。紗布開來平常，一五四號二二六號七一號一五三號一七六號一三七號一五二號一二九號二〇七號七六號等了結，逐漸下游。二〇六號一五六號二二四號一四號一〇二號一一六號一五二號賣至一五一五〇元，一五一號五四號七六號九五號補進，升至一五四〇〇元。紗布下跌不少，存多恐慌，預計國行將有更多之差進，一五二號二三號六一號九八號八九號一一九號二〇三號六〇號二二六號再賣到一四九七〇號，一四三號一七九號一六〇號維持。傳港電報縮，結匯證亦升，午收為一五一二〇元，景福有二二〇號興業之力售而更疲，小股則不免更呈脆弱。結果統益獨吿漲停，五和火柴華新小升，商務尚平，新光動興閘北跌一成，餘者小挫迄跌半成不等。</p>
<p>後市永紗上塲一五四五〇元，一一四號一八五號一三一號雖出，但以港電報小至五分新低價，一六號一三七號六五號二二四號一九二號一二九號九七號四號一一七號二二五號二〇六號二二〇號二〇七號一九〇號三號一六九號都進，中途雖有小回風，國行縱然差進，惟業外刺激陡起，一六九號一九〇號力抬之下，永紗升至一六三二〇元收市。華曁由一〇七號奮購，附和者衆，躍高至漲停板。餘股亦有造就，統益聯地漲停，較晨收除三種漲停者，信誼大通五和未做開，梅林永公小升，榮豐中法漲成半外，餘咸好起半成至一成。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨入盤局，晨開統丙一八三萬，高升至一八六萬而回低至一七五萬，臨收稍見盤升，惟上落甚狹，成交數甚少。五〇〇室及承德賣出，五五二室五〇三室則進，結果較前收計甲乙丁均平，丙戊小一萬元。</p>
<p>證交</p>
<p>昨在市塲揭示，即日起市塲交易上午目九時半至十一時半，下午自二時半至三時半，週六後市照停。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>綢市挺後復軟，初因絲價暴升，乃承隔夜漲勢，續見前挺。大誠被面曾出十八億關，終以一七七五〇〇萬收市，軋漲一一〇〇〇萬，場外喊價續小。</p>
<p>糖市升後稍降，初聞台幣又高，人心振奮，乃承前晚優勢，繼續上挺。後因北市貨價報跌，出戶轉繁，市遂回降。章白情及組砂棧單，明日期均做七三八〇萬，土糖仍漲。</p>
<p>礦物油價格，已轉穩定，大盤市面已較行盤為低。如美孚馬達油行盤售五億餘，而市塲開出僅四億二千萬。汽油桶子貨每加侖三百五十萬可購得，惟鋪面另售仍有喊四百萬者。</p>
<p>柏油因產價與滬市差額甚短，客貨到源不多，本市皂廠及燭淘，屢有問津，去化以皂廠較大。燭淘西陰歷七月間本來亦屬旺季，但近以購買力旣弱，墊頭亦大，故銷量不如上年之大。禾本高喊二億二，平油蘭油，高檔貨亦須二億至二億一千。</p>
<p>星洲椰油，以到貨成本，（依港價加稅）旣高於市價，而皂廠吸胃頻仍，市况至堅，昨市仍喊二億八，同業做二億七，牛油到少，交易未能暢旺。</p>
<p>日光燈鋒俏，因黑市金鈔高昂，人心看好。48吋奇異靑光管每支升至二七五〇萬。又沙而文，亦高至二二〇〇萬，一致上漲一成至二成。</p>
<p>捲烟因永泰和派貨未有確期，門銷尚佳，各廠成本不數，再加檯面幫之哄抬，市價再度上揚，計十支大英八八〇萬。</p>
<p>肥皂因捲烟飛騰，亦被帶秀，再加原料上揚，各廠成本不數，計固本皂七六〇〇萬有成交，亨利皂六一〇〇萬有買戶。</p>
<p>建築材料，雖實銷依然平淡，惟人心已漸轉堅，大號靑磚開價仍站五億二千萬，須自加車力。水泥市塲做價，亦吿硬紮，每袋九百萬加四十萬車力有成交。牛毛毡有喊一億者，惟實際市面在八千五至九千萬之間。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：中國籃球隊，頃在第三部落選賽中以五十四對廿五擊敗英國隊，將於星期四與戰勝埃及之義火利決賽爭第十七名。</p>
<p>中國始終以包松圓，黃天錫，葬文華，李世僑，吳成章正選五虎將出場。英將體格魁梧，但球藝平平，中國隊控制全塲，着着佔先，上半時於輕描淡寫中，以廿三比十四勝九分。易籃後，中國原陣不動，英國頻易守將，企圖稍殺中國鋒鋩，但文華之中距離投射，成章之角邊翻身，松圓籃下托入，俱非英將所能制止。卅六比十七時一，英隊罰球未中，松圓籃下劫球，急傳文華，文華讓與世僑，世僑作投射狀，英將跳起攔阻，世僑妙傳文華，空檔裏一射中的，精彩聯絡，博得滿塲掌聲。英隊中鋒托入時，堂聲尚未絕。世僑還敬，英隊全力進攻，但投籃欠準，屢失良機，反予松圓在籃下大顯身手之機會。此後成章三投三中，文華，松圓亦有所獲，英國僅二投二擲，獲得六分，終場中國以五十四比廿五大勝。</p>

<p>瑞典足球隊自參加世運比賽以來，得以晋入決賽週，尚屬初次。瑞典隊純熟之聯絡與閃電式之進攻法，使在足球發源地英國之職業球隊，亦自嘆弗如。丹麥隊雖遭挫折，但鋒綫亦犀利可畏，瑞典防守力極强，在此次比賽前，先後二戰，未失一球。惟此役開賽後二分鐘，即被丹麥左翼史巴治攻陷一城，瑞典於第十五分鐘平反敗同，繼又再中三球，上半時以四比一佔先。下半時瑞典攻勢仍盛，但丹麥鐵門尼爾遜表演出色，力挽狂瀾，未有再失。第三十一分，丹麥左鋒哈爾遜於廿碼處舉左足力叩，球如彈發，擦楣入網，追成二比四。此後瑞典兩輔回師保衛，丹麥力攻無效，遂被瑞典海汰。</p>

<h3>詩歌讚美　號角齊鳴　奧林匹克大會開幕記　偉大熱烈展開空前盛况</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鐘震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕七月廿九日—在倫敦人的眼光中看來，確是一個不平凡的日子，因為自從經過第二次大戰破壞後，倫敦元氣大傷，始終處於消沉的氣氛中，而此次轟動全球和平後首屆世界運動會，能在倫敦舉行，無疑的是給這個行將沒落的大都市一個欣欣向榮的機會。</p>
<p>歐洲今年自六月底以來，天氣極不正常，夏行冬令，連日陰雨，為一九一九年從未有的記錄。因此許多人都担心它會影響到千載難逢的世運會進行。但自本月廿四日起，低氣壓似乎也被市民熱烈的情緒驅走，水銀柱疾升至九十餘度，晴空烈日，顯出夏天的原來面目。</p>
<p>萬頭攢動</p>
<p>這喧嚷已久的第十四屆奧林匹克運動會，終於在今天（二十九日）下午在英王主持下，於英國倫敦南部溫布萊皇家體育塲隆重啓幕。自中午十二時以後，由市中心到溫布萊公園的地下車和公共汽軍，都加添了班次，可是在比例上，仍追不上觀衆的人數。據報上登載，在開幕前三日售出門票的統計，超過六萬四千張，而整個體育塲最多祇能容納八萬二千人。午後一時，自溫布萊公國地下車站到體育場的公路上，都已擠滿人，停車的廣塲，也宣吿客滿，觀衆都集在體育場·帝國遊泳池·工程宮·和BBC廣播公司的門前，等候入塲。典型的倫敦警士，驕了高大的駿馬，全體出動來維持秩序。記者在設於民衆會塲中的新聞處下望人羣，如百節長蛇在蠕動，數萬觀衆在烈日下擁擠着，興緻殊濃，沿途飄揚着五環奧林匹克的標幟，出售節目單和紀念品的小販，拚命高喊着，以兜銷手中的貨物。　二小時後，會塲四週的看台上，已擠得滿坑滿谷，萬頭攢動。參加國的旗幟，在看台的四週，迎風飄蕩。在會場中間的一巨幅記分牌上，寫着：「在奧林匹克運動會中，最重要的並不是在取得勝利，而是尋求人才，並非是在能戰勝旁人，而是在努力角逐。」面對着皇家包廂—司令台—的看臺上，是一隊數百穿着白衣服的唱詩班，和百餘身穿鮮紅制服·黑褲黑帽的皇家守衛音樂大隊。攝取電影的開麥拉，是放置在高處，八萬餘的覜衆，都凝神地等待着開幕禮的舉行。</p>
<p>英皇蒞臨</p>
<p>二時二十五分，一隊英國侍從騎兵音樂隊，進入會場，站在皇家包廂前，吹出雄壯的號聲。數十位身穿大禮服的國際奧林匹克體育會和第十四屆奧林西克委員會的全體委員，魚貫入場，列隊站在皇家包廂前，靜候着英國皇屬的蒞臨，二時半在樂聲鏗鏘中，英皇喬治六世，穿着天藍色的海軍上將制服，偕同島后和瑪格麗公主，趨往委員的隊列前，看台上傳來一遍高呼「萬歲聲」。旋即奧林匹克委員會會長將所有之委員介紹給英皇，在國際奧林匹克委員會會長瑞典艾德斯托姆，及本屆大會會長卜爾托爵土引導之下，進入皇家包廂座。全體觀衆肅立，奏英國國歌。</p>
<p>選手遊行</p>
<p>此後樂隊高奏進行曲，在抑揚頓挫的樂聲中，五十九國的六千選手，進入會塲。由希臘隊領先，前面是一童子軍，手持木牌，上書國家各字，後面為手執國旗的選手。希臘隊全體選手，穿着灰色制服白鞋，因為是第一隊故倍受觀衆之注意。以後按着英文併音字母次序而排列，故隨後即為穿着深綠色制服，頭戴土耳其帽之阿富汗選手們。各國代表整隊繞塲一週，在面對着司令台的一塊草地上排列着。選手們之制服，最受人注目，是丹麥選手們的紅衣白褲，女選手更頭戴白色法蘭西帽，與隊伍前之紅底白十字的丹麥國旗，互相輝映下，更覺鮮艷異常。吾國代表有五十餘人，藍制服白長褲白襯衫，紫紅領帶，黑皮鞋，精神煥發，博得掌聲不少。</p>
<p>宣佈開幕</p>
<p>漫長六千人的大隊列，歷一小時零五分剛完畢。大會主席即致開幕辭，內容是：報吿此次大會議決在倫敦舉行之經過，並希望參加的五十餘國，從世界每一個角落裏趕來的靑年，互建起友愛的精神。並謂：在四十年前一九〇八年第四屆奧林匹克會也在此地舉行，當時主持者為國父喬洽五世，而今則由英皇六世來主持典禮等語。致詞後英皇在擴播機前，宣讀開幕詞並慶祝此屆大會能加期舉行。高呼萬歲之聲，又復四起。樂聲號角聲中，彩色五環的奧林匹克會旗，徐徐上升，跑道旁童子軍的籐箱，頓時啓高，七千信鴿振翅翱翔，一時空中滿佈白鴿·唱詩班高唱奧林匹克讚美詩。飛機數架，盤旋會場低空。鳴砲二十一響。四時七分正炎炬來臨，由年方廿三的約翰馬克，手持已燃燒達十二日，由希臘奧林匹克古廟中携來的火炬，迎面衝大。在陽光照射下，美麗極頂，繞場一週後，即跑上大門頂端，在白色大理石柱中點燃着，茲後由美代表團領導各國選手宣稱：「余等宣誓，予等忠實參加奧林匹克之競賽，遵守一切大會之規律，重視體育道德及精神，為體育爭光」。此時唱詩班歌聲又起，觀衆歡呼鼓掌，聲徹雲霄，人潮達于瘋狂。最後在進行曲演奏中，各選手隊引退，開幕禮吿完成。此後十四天中，將在倫敦哈林蓋鼓賽場，杜爾威治，紀斯威公園等廿一處，進行如火如荼動人心魄之角逐，廿萬來倫敦的觀衆，都熱烈地等候着輝煌的成績記錄。</p>
<h3>東北遷平院校　部準各自辦理　校址確定即可分別開課　私校學生須待編級試驗</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕敎部九日已明令東北各國立院校遷平，並准各自辦理。東北高等敎育可入軌道，各方之要求，獲得如此結果，咸表滿意。敎部致各院校負賣人電稱：「東北遷平四國立院校，東大，瀋醫，長白，長火，仍由各院校負責人自行辦理。臨時大學之任務，為協助各院校選校手續事宣，並將巳到平學生分別登記，或帮同分發借讀。如原校認為遷至北平，一切有人負賣，立即分別移交原校單獨辦理。」關於未立案學校學生，教部另電指示稱：「到平後尚未取得學籍者，一律回補習班收容登記審核，在補習期內，由四院校會同該班辦理入學及編級試驗，及格者得編入相當年級，並將其過去在私立學校學籍與成績特別予以承認。」根據此令，東大，長白師院，因師生已到齊，俟校址分配竣事，即可自臨大分出，九月底可正式開踝。</p>
<h3>關於豫魯流亡來京學生救濟工作　教部昨發表談話　希本其堅苦心志嚴守秩序　就學問題已妥籌安置辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕敎部發言人十一日就豫會流亡學生救濟工作發表談話如次：「自豫魯共匪擴大叛變，戡亂戰事益趨激烈，匪區學生不甘受匪裏脅，紛紛南下，其心志與經歷良足憫念；本部早於汴垣陷匪時，即開始辦理救濟工作，輔導就學。惟以來京學生之學籍身份，各不相同，臨時救濟，固可同一辦理，輔導就學則不能不分別情節，設法安置。二月來，本部各司處主管經常籌議救濟輔導辦法，隨時舉辦；並會同首都有關機關，普遍辦理臨時救濟工作，無日間歇。本部輔導會工作隊，亦於各地隨時照料收容，計到京·豫·魯·蘇中學生一萬三千餘人，其先期到京，確有學籍學生，已登記進臨中及夏令營者三千五百餘人；其學籍不明，及後來者，有九千餘人，已分借京市中小學二十餘所收容救濟，並正妥議設法復學中。到京學生多能嚴守秩序，自愛自重；惟仍有少數學生，要求越理，聚衆要脅，如七月八口，本年應屆中學畢業生二百餘人，要求無條件分發國立大學就讀。八月一日，卅六年度以前巾學畢業生二百餘人，要求保送大學。九日未經立案私立中原工學院學生一百餘人，要求免試轉讀大學。十日抵京未久之中學生一千餘人，要求即入學校，增發伙食費等，皆其著者。且動輒封鎖交通，盤踞公署，行動越軌，愈演愈烈，至堪痛惜！本部顧念學生盧境，故迭次請願，各主管無不反復說明，苦口開導，幸未輩生事端；惟時局動盪，共匪正伺機乘隙，戕害靑年，稍一不愼，後果堪處。至盼來京學生，本其堅苦心志，發揮理智，嚴守秩序，不可率意行動，自暴自棄。至就學問題，本部已分別情節，妥議安價辦法，幷召集魯·豫兩廳廳長，　西南，豫東各中學校長來京會商，籌議學校復員」。</p>
<h3>電邀綏區各廳長　到京商教育問題</h3>
<p>敎部訂方案將開會商討</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕敎部為討論綏靖區敎育月上許多亟待解決之問題，已擬訂整個敎育方案，電邀有關各省之敎育應長來京開會。聞魯敎廳長李泰華已到京，鄂·熱·豫等省敎育廳長亦將來京參加會議。</p>
<h3>教局訂後日舉行學費座談會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局定於本週星期六（十四日）下午三時，假座山海關路育才中學舉行本市弒立大中小學下學期學費問題座談會，邀請朱經農，顧樹森與市參議員，大學敎授，本市公私立中小學校長敎員代表與各校家長會主席等出席，共同商討下學期學費以何種方式征收及合理之數字俾使學校開支得以維持，並能顧及家長負担，以作市府統一標準時之根據與參考。</p>

<h3>南昌和上海</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>吳市長是一個好官，有魄力，有熱情，而最難能可貴的，却是詞令之佳，堪稱全國數一數二。</p>
<p>這次公用事業價格空前狂漲，當然吳市長不能不說幾句話。</p>
<p>但是，吳市長在昨天（八月九日）除掉再說了一次一公用事業之狂漲，實非市府力所能制」的老話以外，却舉了一個不大平凡的例子。他表示，據他所知道，「南昌公用事業價格已五億於上海，而人民竟無怨言。」</p>
<p>為養麼南昌的市民竟有「鏡花綠」小說裏的君子國之風，能够那樣深明　夢之這呢？據吳市長解釋說：「蓋以南昌公用事業公司曾因不能維持而被迫停電停水，致人民不勝困苦，不得已願出高價請其繼續供應。」</p>
<p>吳市長舉出這個例子來，用意是很明顯的：（一）上海的公甩事業值格還是便宜的，你們不要嘩啦嘩啦；（二）公用事業的權格是眞不二價的，你要用水電就祇得硬着頭皮「項」，否則就要不客氣停電停水了，何必等到了「不勝困苦」的時候，才「不得已願出高價請其繼續供應」，弄得「請酒不吃吃罰酒」呢？</p>
<p>吳市長所舉的例十當然是事實。天下的烏鴉一般黑，公用事業在無能的官吏管理之下，隨便以停水停電來威脅人民，强迫人民付出高價，也當然是事實。人民旣不能得到地方政府的支援，　水電又為人生所必需，在這種情形下無法堅持，祗好忍痛屈服，當然更是事實。</p>
<p>與市長的話中，祗有「人民竟無怨言」和後文「不得已」三個字稍有冲碰—大概是一種「毫無怨言」的「不得已」罷，不過聽聽總覺得有些特別。然而此係小節，不必多說。</p>
<p>不過，吳市長在發表上一段談話的時候，不知道有沒有看見當天（八月九日）的本報。在那天本報的第二版上有一個花邊新聞，是短短的一條本報藩陽七日專電，電云：「長春市長尚傳道電此間稱：長春高梁米每斤售價達法幣千萬元，市民購米以兩計，史無前例，市面流行五億元本票。」</p>
<p>萬一過了幾天上海米價又趨波動時，不知道吳市長也要比一比，說。「長春米價已××倍於上海，而老百姓論兩買米，竟仍能活命」否？</p>
<p>若說長春是長春，上海是上海，不能相比；那麼，南昌難道就是上海麼？</p>
<p>我至今還淸淸楚楚地記得吳市長在淸華同學會席上發表的就任後第一次演說。他說，為了壓平物價，他下了決心要取締奸商，「不惜得罪多數人」。他又勸工人要和資方開誠布公，相互合作，切不可殺雞取蛋。然而，公用事業開支旣與生活指數有密切關係，那麼這次漲價刺激指數，指數再刺激物價，工商業如何避免得了遲早成為「被殺之雞」的命運？吳市長實在應該拿出「不惜得罪人」的勇氣來，救救這些奄奄一息的瘦谿病雞了。</p>
<p>南昌的例十是可怕的；然而可怕的倒還不是唯利是圖的南昌公用事業公司，而是不顧老百姓死活的南昌地方當局——那樣的無能，那樣的懦弱，那樣的冷酷！</p>
<h3>遐庵近作</h3>
<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>秋將至矣萬籟皆鳴賦示睹友</p>
<p>靜觀入悟浮靈態，倦旅寗期惡太陰。豈有鵷　歆腐鼠，却憐孔雀是家萬。居貞巳分成長恨，杆尺何　得　尋！惆悵魚龍空曼衍，好傾東海洗余心。</p>
<p>病中憶廣州軍政府時事念組安仲愷梯雲</p>
<p>少白諸君均已謝人世漫成一律以示哲</p>
<p>生海濱鐵城子文禺生諸君</p>
<p>濫觴疇復循前迹，支廈曾經竭衆心。永念艱處今孰共？更憐衰謝日相尋。神傷燕雀附堂室，夢冷雞　在洠林。誰信雞鳴風雨際，五陵佳氣日蕭森。</p>
<h3>恐懼</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>憂慮造成恐懼，恐懼造成不幸。你懸空的在一條狹窄的木板上走着，愈是恐懼，愈易跌倒；愈不恐懼，則反可安然走過。人生如此。實用的政治也是如此。</p>
<p>千句併一句來說：當局「預吿五百萬大鈔的出世，是一種恐懼；說大鈔影響物價，乃人民「心理錯覺」所形成，也是一種恐懼。蕭伯納說：「捕鼠機可以捕捉老鼠。但捕鼠機追逐老鼠，便有點難以想像了！」大鈔與物價的關係，並不以越野賽跑更較複雜。因此最好大鈔偷偷的出了，却又未能如此，於是索興將更「大」的鈔也預吿了，藉以减少「刺激」。這個「刺激」已非對物價的刺激，而是對人民惑官的刺激。因為實際上，當「大」鈔正式問世時，物價還是會跟上的。</p>
<p>因此當局是在怛然四顧的情形下發行大鈔的。一個極端恐懼的人一「想」在冬天學游泳，夏天學滑冰，却又未能如願以償，殊可憫憐。恐懼的由來，說得原始一點，是動物在危險時所以保擭其生命之用。副腎腺分泌增加，心跳迅速，血液流動頻繁，肌肉抖動。許多動物就在這樣的情形下拘擊起來。往往為了保護其部份的危險，而置整體於不顧。老應就常常利用小谿拘擊性的恐怖而攫取之。蛇也是這個樣子。</p>
<p>恐懼並非傷寒，却是可以傳染的。華德狄斯耐常常在他的卡通片裏，告訴我們這樣的故事：一鹿恐懼，率先奔逃，羣鹿隨之；若領頭的跌落山谷而死，羣鹿也就跌落山谷而死。一宅失火，長者奔逃，闔家沒有不奔逃的。社會心理學家說服從命令基於恐懼。若發佈命令也是基於恐懼，那就大可悲哀了。徒然使恐懼的觀念日益擴大，因而造成惶惶的今日。</p>
<p>據說理想的政治基於一愛情」。這個「愛情」在現狀下說來，也許要指Romantic　Love了！即是要將被愛的對象看作很難佔有的，十分珍貴的，於是費盡心機去博得這個對象的愛情。無論用詩篇也好，歌曲也好，即用Spanish　Guitar，也無不可，只要你在挑動琴弦時熱誠而有自信。但你若哆嗦着去求愛，你就休想討得姑娘們的歡心。</p>
<p>我並不是經濟學家。但我相信沒有一個經濟學家能將目下的經濟情形全部改造，正如外科聲生不能重造人生的組織一樣。但假如當局能踏着自信的步伐穩重的撥動着三舷，也許對整個經濟的穩定不無裨益。</p>
<p>披塞斜塔十八世紀即已開始傾斜，假如人人恐懼其倒塌，也許早已重建了。心理對於「人體」的影響就常常是這樣的驚人的。</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>一九四七年中，美國生產的香烟達三千五百十萬萬支之多，其中三百萬萬支是輸出國外的，國內消耗平均每人每年二千二百九十三支，即每星期每人消耗二十支裝的香烟二包，包括老祖母及剛落地的嬰孩在內。</p>
<p>紡織業近來又有一種新發明叫「美龍」（Malon）的人造樹脂，抹在棉布上可以給它加上一種綢光，洗不退，磨不掉。這樣加過工的被單可以加一倍的壽命。</p>
<p>美國各地公路上，本年內都已裝置一種安全設備。這種設備包括兩面四方的大鏡子，用鐵架支撑起來，安放在上坡下坡急轉彎或與鐵道交通點的公路兩旁。</p>
<p>英國至今還在發掘大戰時陷入地下而未曾爆發的炸彈。這些炸彈有的深入六十英尺以下，有的却歪斜到遠及三十英尺之處。</p>
<p>風行於全球的派克五十一型筆，它須經過二百三十八種製造與裝配的程序，每枝製造時間共計三十三分鐘，其中零件製造達二十六分鐘，完成裝配須七分鐘。</p>
<p>史達林每次乘火車出巡時，專車的司機總是一位女子名叫茜奈特·達賴玆洛亞。史氏信任她的程度超過於任何男司機。</p>
<h3>談選擇</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>天賦人以選擇的本領，倘能善自運用，左右逢源，受惠無窮。孔子主張「母友不如己者」，而美國當代作家約翰杜柏索氏（據最近消息傅來，此公不久前乘車失事，其妻喪命，本人已眇一目）寫一個交際花，初上好萊塢去的時候，老是跟臨時演員和起碼角色混在一起，認為沒有什麼意思。美國名人某公亦謂，足下如欲發財，須跟有錢的人厮混。這雖是鑒於世態炎凉的過激之談，但是於此可見個人如欲建功立業，於交友上不可不慎加選擇。</p>
<p>事實上，吾人的日常生活中，如能多費此選擇工夫，必司多得若干收穫。購買任何用品，徜能事先審擇，則買來的咖啡，不致發霉，襯衫的袖子十不致太大，衣料上不致有經過織補的小孔。甚至以坐黃包車而論，倘能揀選一個年輕力壯的車夫，拉了一部墊子雪白，扶手整潔，有毯子墊脚的事子，則不但他拉起來健步如飛，而且足下夏季所穿的白色上衣或襯衫，擱在車槓上，也可無沾上灰塵或鐵銹之慮。</p>
<p>達爾文天演論的要旨云物競天擇，適者生存。所謂天擇，究竟是很抽象的東西，實際上在選擇的，還是同一社會間的個人而已。如果選　愈嚴，則淘汰愈多，而社會進步也愈速，雖然從感情的觀點看來，對於時代落伍者的力竭而蹶，不免稍嫌殘酷一些。</p>
<h3>馬黎的美術品黑市</h3>
<p>— 如是</p>
<p>歐洲目前正碰到了一次新的「交藝復興」，藝術品的價格天天猛漲—可是收藏這些藝術品的人們却不再是以前的巨紳大買了。今天，買畫的顧客們確是出了空前的高價，一擲千金，毫無音色；但他們那些錢的來源，却是靠了囤積居奇，經營黑市，或者大規模的走私。</p>
<p>他們倒並非附庸風雅，他們祗是想低進昂出，從這些美術品上再做一筆賺錢的生意。美術品本身也已造成了黑市，馬賽和那波里斯等城都是黑市美術品的集散地。不過，最重要的活動中心當然是巴黎。</p>
<p>巴黎着實有不少發「國難財」和「勝利財」的人，他們資產的來源大都不可究詰，但他們為了便於私相授受起見，所藏的鈔票大都是票面五千法郎的大票。最近法國國家銀行為了要打擊這批奸商，突然宣稱，凡持有票而五千法郎大票的人民統須于七十二小時內向該行掉換小票，過了這時候，這種大票就作廢了。這一下當然使那些暴發的奸商大吃一驚，可是他們腦筋一動，就想出了一條妙計：買畫。</p>
<p>他們以極高的價格收進了許多名畫，付款時全部是票面五千法郎的大票。賣書的人拿了這些大票去兌小票自然不成問題，他們的大票是由正當的交易得來的，而那些暴發的奸商們却巳經心滿意足的出淸了這些大票。賣畫的人當然也不是傻子，就乘此機會大敲竹槓，有一個人在限期前二十四小時內費出了一批書，拿到了共值一千萬法郎的大票，而這一千萬法郎中，他凈賺的數目倒在七百萬法郎以上。</p>
<p>有一個人，戰前是當裁縫的，碰到一位專門收藏名畫的顧客，欠了他的賬，那位顧客就送了他幾張畫作為補償，不料這位裁縫做生意的門壏極精，就從這幾張書開手做起，一路順風，現在巳經特建了一座巴黎第一流的畫廊。</p>
<p>德軍佔領法國時，許多法國的畫家都逃到了釆被德軍佔領的維希區中，那時國外匯兌巳斷，他們的作品簡直毫無出路，為了衣食，他們就祇好把這些作品賤賣。那時有幾位目光遠大的畫商乘便機源源買進，今日他們便成為巴黎畫市中紅極一時的大戶。</p>
<p>活躍於巴黎一美術黑市」中的人物，倒也不一定都是心狠手辣祇曉得發財的傢伙。有一個以前幹銀行的人說，「你看看歐洲的局面罷，誰都不知道倒底會發生些什麼事情。如果打起仗來，法郎不值錢，怎麼樣？當然應該多買一些有價實價值的東西。買畫最好，一有什麼風聲，祇要拿出畫框，一捲就可以帶了跑。」</p>
<p>在這種交易中，美國兵倒居然也並不後人。一個駐柏林的美國兵以三條香烟換到了一張好畫，一到巴黎，賣到了三十萬法郎，但是他不知道這張畫一轉眼就漲到七十萬法郎了。</p>
<p>「美術品黑市」中最吃香的貨色是新派畫家的作品，最時髦的畫家是莫迪格里雅尼，比卡索，瑪諦斯，烏德利洛，白拉格等。但遭些畫家現在大都不大熟心作畫，如比卡索雖已畫了不少，却就難得肯拿出來賣。他知道物以希為貴的道理，在此賓價飛漲的時候，實在不願出品太多，以免造成了跌價的局面。</p>

<h3>President Visits Olive Mountain in Gu Ling; Invites Li Zongren to Discuss Matters; Weng Wenhao and Yu Hongjun to Visit Lu Mountain in Coming Days</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Gu Ling, 11th] This morning, the President, for the first time, went for a solitary outing in Gu Ling. He went to Songguang Ridge on Olive Mountain in northern Gu Ling to enjoy the view. The First Lady remained at the official residence. At 9:15 AM, the President walked out of the official residence, accompanied by more than ten attendants. He walked along Hedong Road, Zheng Street, Xijie Street and Xuan Yuan Road before climbing Olive Mountain. Few people knew about this at the time. When passers-by saw the President, they bowed in respect. The President took off his hat and nodded in return, a happy smile on his face. The President wore a dark grayish-blue silk long gown, green socks, cloth shoes, and a gray cork hat, looking very elegant as he walked down the street. The stone steps on Olive Mountain were quite steep. After the President reached the top, he felt slightly hot, so he sat on a stone bench halfway up the mountain to rest, also taking off his long gown and wearing only a white cloth shirt and trousers. Upon hearing the news, Gan Province Chairman Hu Jiafeng and Administration Director Wang Zuomin rushed to the scene, accompanying the President after climbing the mountain. The President then went to Songguang Ridge, looking out for about ten minutes before descending the mountain. By this time, the residents all knew that the President was out and about, and waited on the side of the road. The President appeared relaxed as he descended the mountain, still not riding in a vehicle. There were the most people gathered in front of the Hu Jinfang Inn.

<h3>US Authorities Predict; If the Republican Party Takes Office Next Year; Military Aid to China Will Be Strengthened; US Army Chief Expresses Optimism About China's Military</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] Authorities predicted on the 10th that China will fully utilize 125 million US dollars of US military aid by January next year. If the Republican Party is in power by then, China will make new requests for increased aid to combat the communists. They also believe that if the Republican Party is in power, it is highly likely that it will allocate more aid funds to China than the Democratic government. If so, the new plan will follow the plan to aid Turkey and Greece, sending "instructors" to guide the army on the battlefield, which is promising. Observers believe that although there are now signs that the Truman administration has accelerated aid to China after some delay, for practical purposes, China must choose one of two policies. One is full aid to the Chinese National Government, a policy favored by Congress under the leadership of Senator Bridges and Representative Eder. The other is the Truman administration's policy of providing aid while stipulating that this aid is not responsible for the policies of the National Government. According to Bridges, "The China policy adopted by the current government in the past few years cannot be called a bipartisan policy in any way." Bridges added that he hopes the government has begun a new policy, and if this is the case, the Truman administration has been urged by congressional action. The Truman administration said that the military aid plan "should not be regarded as an assumption that the US government is responsible for the policies, actions, missions of China, or any situation that occurs in China at any time." Truman's remarks are considered particularly important by well-informed people, because this remark indicates that the US government still has reservations about China's domestic politics, which convinces Bridges and other members of Congress that the aid plan is valuable, is the report submitted by Lieutenant General Weidmeier to the Senate and House of Representatives in a closed-door meeting a few months ago. Weidmeier's "plan" includes more active US training of the Chinese army. It is rumored that Secretary of the Army Beyer is increasingly optimistic about the hope that the Chinese government army can win. Since July 23, China has purchased 9 million US dollars of military materials from the US armed forces. However, well-informed sources pointed out that China is still having difficulties in obtaining the aircraft fuel it needs. It is said that the obstacle lies in the Export Licensing Administration of the Department of Commerce. Because the Department of Commerce has not yet announced the Chinese distribution quantities for July, August, and September. However, the amount of aviation gasoline given to China in January, February, and March of this year was 60,000 barrels, and increased to 160,000 barrels in April, May, and June.</p>
<p>Although this aid to China plan was formulated by a special legislative conference, the transportation of aviation gasoline and other petroleum products is handled by the Export Administration Office of the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce cannot promptly announce the distribution quantities for July, August, and September, claiming that the reason is that the domestic needs of the United States are also increasing. It is said that the needs of various countries are increasing, and the government's highest authorities must decide how to distribute gasoline exports.</p>
<h3>Southern Anhui Will Establish a Pacification Department; Li Jue Will Be Appointed as Commander; Legislators and Supervisors from Anhui Province Request the Government to Recover Northern Anhui</h3>

It is internally decided that Li Jue, the former commander of the Fourteenth Pacification District stationed in Fuyang, will be appointed as the commander of the Southern Anhui Pacification District.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 11th] After the National Army actively abandoned Cheyang, an important town in northern Anhui, the vast area of the northern Anhui Plain is now completely controlled by the bandits.

<h3>Central Government Agencies and Schools' Regular Expenses Increased Twofold Based on Original Budget; Subsidy Plan for Provinces and Cities Also Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The principle of additional funding for the regular expenses of central government agencies and schools for the second half of the 37th year has been discussed and approved during the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 11th. According to this principle, the national treasury will bear an additional 158.4 billion yuan. This will be implemented from July and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The two principles are as follows: (1) All central government agencies and schools, regardless of their level, will have their original budget for the second half of the year increased twofold. However, second-level supervisory agencies may make overall adjustments to the total additional amount for their subordinate agencies, taking into account the complexity of their affairs. (2) The regular expenses of the Ministry of National Defense and its affiliated agencies, schools, and troops will be increased twofold based on the original budget of 319.88 billion yuan for June of this year, with no further additions to the increased portion.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of office expenses and travel allowances for various agencies, it was also brought up at the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 11th and approved, with the following two decisions: (1) For central government agencies' office expenses, four times the original budget will be allocated first in July. Subsequently, adjustments will be made monthly based on the price index of office supplies. For agencies affiliated with ministries and commissions, two times the original budget will still be added based on the opinion of the budget review committee, with their supervisory agencies taking into account the complexity of affairs and local price conditions to make overall adjustments. (2) For travel allowances, the original standard set in the 24th year of the Republic of China was divided into six levels based on official rank, with daily rates of 18, 12, 8, 6, 4, and 2 yuan respectively. The revised standard will be six levels with daily rates of 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2 yuan. This standard will be multiplied by the cost of living index for civil servants in the Beijing-Shanghai area for the month of travel to determine the actual amount of travel expenses.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The subsidy plan for various provinces and cities for the second half of the 37th year has been approved at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 11th. Regarding the preparation of budgets for various provinces and cities for the second half of the 37th year, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Finance had previously jointly formulated guidelines, which were circulated by the Executive Yuan to the governments of various provinces and cities for compliance. The second provision stipulates that central subsidy income should be budgeted according to the approved plan for the first half of the year. Now, according to the detailed list of subsidies for various provinces and cities for the second half of the year submitted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, totaling 319,821,323,000 yuan, the Budget Review Committee reported that the construction subsidies for the first half of the year for the ten provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Beijing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou were adjusted within the budgets of those provinces and cities and reclassified from the central general subsidy amount, and have all been allocated. They should still be listed in the second half of the year to comply with the regulations. Errors in the calculation of living subsidies for Anhui Province and supplementary food expenses for Jiangxi and Fujian Provinces should be corrected and distributed. The central subsidies for thirty-two provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic of China, totaling 325,421,356,300 yuan, will be drawn from the general and special budget subsidy funds for provinces and cities, and all provinces and cities will be instructed to comply with the preparation of the general budget for revenues and expenditures.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has recently issued instructions to various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments, stating: "As we approach the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional rule, all agencies with outstanding expense accounting reports that have not yet been submitted for review should promptly prepare and submit them in accordance with the law."</p>

<h3>Signs of Hong Kong Dollar Depreciation</h3>
<p>Recently, the British government has taken two measures to restrict Hong Kong's trade: one is that, starting from July 20, the remittance of British pounds between London and Hong Kong is limited to 500 pounds; the other is that, starting from August 3, all foreign exchange profits obtained from the export of goods should be converted at the official rate and transferred to the Hong Kong government. However, exports to the United States, the Philippines, Macau, Korea, Japan, China, and the British pound area are not subject to this restriction. Therefore, the Far Eastern Economic Review of Hong Kong has published an article predicting that Hong Kong may withdraw from the British pound area. The reasons are as follows: "It is beneficial for Hong Kong to withdraw from the British pound area, both now and in the future. Most economic observers believe that Hong Kong is in fact just a large seaport and should not be included in the British pound area. Moreover, Hong Kong's trade is gradually decreasing, and in order to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity, no restrictions should be imposed at this time."</p>
<p>Are the British government's measures to restrict Hong Kong's trade reasonable? Is it possible for Hong Kong to withdraw from the British pound area? We will not discuss these issues for the time being, but in any case, some of the wealthy people in our country who regard Hong Kong as a paradise can wake up from their dreams! The prosperity of Hong Kong after the war is entirely a kind of deformed development, and the high value of the Hong Kong dollar is entirely created by a small number of speculative merchants in our country. Not to mention the situation in various parts of South China, even in Shanghai alone, illegal businesses privately converting Hong Kong currency are as numerous as carp crossing the river. Although the Economic Police Brigade of the police station has repeatedly cracked down on them, they are still "wildfires that cannot be extinguished, and spring breezes that bring them back to life." The day before yesterday, seven businesses were cracked down on, and the total amount of currency conversion reached more than 10 trillion, which is shocking. Although the 27 people arrested will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for processing, those merchants who regard Hong Kong as a paradise may not necessarily be alerted by this. We really don't understand how those money-grubbing merchants can be so confused. Even if they don't think about the country, they have to think about their own interests. Why should they risk breaking the law by privately converting the Hong Kong dollar that the British government does not take? May I ask, can the value of capital be maintained by escaping to Hong Kong? Greed overwhelms reason, to the point that they not only forget the interests of the country, but also don't even know how to plan for their own interests, which really makes us puzzled!</p>
<p>Some people say: "The Hong Kong government issues banknotes and also has a full reserve of British pounds. Even if Hong Kong's trade is still insufficient at present, Hong Kong can still maintain a balance of payments with foreign countries." This statement may seem reasonable to simple-minded merchants, but from our point of view, it is tantamount to admitting without being beaten that the Hong Kong dollar is about to depreciate.</p>
<p>First, the total amount of Hong Kong dollars issued has never been announced by the Hong Kong government, so we naturally cannot know. However, there are various signs that are sufficient to prove that the expansion of the Hong Kong dollar has also reached a considerable level. Just in terms of the Hong Kong dollars flowing out in various parts of South China, the number is already considerable. If the issuance of Hong Kong dollars does have a full reserve of British pounds, why should the British government restrict remittances between London and Hong Kong? Isn't it obvious that the British government is deeply afraid that the expansion of the Hong Kong dollar will affect the British pound?</p>
<p>Second, people in our country's industrial and commercial circles, because they have seen the expansion and persistence of domestic wars, have taken what they call "self-preservation measures." Those who have capital are naturally willing to risk breaking the law by privately converting Hong Kong currency and escaping to Hong Kong. Even those who have factories or shops are trying their best to prepare to move south to Hong Kong, which has suddenly increased the population of Hong Kong and created an unprecedented deformed prosperity. Since the need for Hong Kong dollar chips has greatly increased, the Hong Kong dollar will inevitably increase its issuance. However, Hong Kong is a small island, and the food needed by the citizens and the raw materials needed by the factories all need to be supplied from outside Hong Kong. Therefore, it is naturally not an easy task to maintain a balance of payments with foreign countries for a long time. If the Hong Kong government can indeed maintain a balance of payments with foreign countries, why should the British government require Hong Kong's exporters to convert their foreign exchange earnings at the official rate and transfer them to the Hong Kong government?</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, it seems that we can conclude that the internal crisis lurking in Hong Kong is also very serious. Far-sighted British people have already felt this crisis. In the future, whether Hong Kong remains in the British pound area or withdraws from the British pound group, the depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar is always inevitable. Those wealthy people who have escaped to Hong Kong with capital, or those manufacturers who have moved their factories south to Hong Kong, may have been complacent in the past, thinking that their methods are superior to others, but now they should be able to suddenly realize it! Escaping with capital or moving factories south has not only damaged the health of our country's economy, but also, in the end, even their own interests may not be guaranteed. Can you still say that Hong Kong is your Shangri-La?</p>
<h3>Reforming the Monetary System Requires Caution; The Urgent Task is to Supervise Issuance; Pan Gongzhan Expresses His Views at a Current Affairs Symposium</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Current Affairs Commentary Society held a current affairs symposium at the City Bank on the fourth floor yesterday. Pan Gongzhan, He Xiya, Zhu Baiying, Li Zongwen, Wei Youfei, Zhuang Zhihuan, Fang Qiuwei, and others participated. The symposium was hosted by chief editors Pan Shijie and Wei Yiping. The symposium started at 8 p.m. and ended at 9:30 p.m. The topic was centered on rescuing the legal tender crisis. Pan Gongzhan advocated caution in reforming the monetary system, believing that reform would inevitably fail and only cause disturbances in the state of unbalanced fiscal revenue and expenditure. The urgent task is to strictly supervise the issuance, and the fiscal deficit should never be made up for by means of issuance. Only in this way can the economic situation turn around, and the Ministry of Finance's right to issue currency must be taken back. There are three ways to offset the deficit: (1) Increase the income of state-owned enterprises, (2) Improve tax collection methods. Under the current system, the amount of tax revenue that actually enters the national treasury is less than half. In order to adapt to the actual situation of our country, it may be advisable to go backward and adopt a tax farming system, which would be more beneficial. (3) Sell compensation materials, surplus materials, enemy and puppet property, and state-owned enterprises. Pan also believes that today, the minister of finance should first have the confidence to meet fiscal expenditures without increasing currency issuance, otherwise, there is no need to cling to the position. Zhu Baiying, Li Zongwen, and others spoke successively, all advocating that future issuance must be independent. Even if there is still a limited deficit in fiscal revenue and expenditure, it must go through legal procedures and borrow from the central bank, and everything must be handled according to banking principles in order to get on the right track. In addition, there are many economic reform plans currently under consideration by the government, and the outside world has made various speculations about them, with many rumors. In fact, it is more beneficial to adopt a public discussion method for the determination of major principles and plans than to make secret decisions.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Direct Goods Tax Agency Only Lays Off Over 700 People</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] This time, the merger and reorganization of the various levels of the direct and goods tax agencies of the Ministry of Finance into national tax agencies led to rumors that more than 3,000 employees in the Jiangsu region were laid off. The person in charge of the National Taxation Administration said: The total number of personnel in the original direct tax agencies at all levels in the Jiangsu region was 1,280, and the total number of personnel in the goods tax agencies at all levels was 1,452, totaling 2,732. The total number of personnel used in the National Taxation Bureau and the various levels of the Inspection and Collection Bureau after this merger and reorganization is 1,957, which is only a reduction of 775 people compared with the total number of personnel in the original direct and goods tax agencies. The laid-off personnel this time have a set of layoff standards, which are very fair, and so on. The previous rumors do not match the facts.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Resolve Boundary Issue Between Gansu Province and Alxa Banner</h3>

<h3>Second District Supervision Group of Jiangsu Province Discusses Treatment of Public School Teachers</h3>
<p>Decided to Implement Partial Salary in Kind (Rice) System</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 11th Dispatch] Shen Peng, Zhang Da, and other members of the Supervision Group for Suppression of Rebellion and Implementation of Administration in the Second District of Jiangsu Province, today discussed mass training and financial affairs in Suzhou in groups. As a result, it was deemed that the budget expenditure of 240 billion yuan for the second half of the year was too large, and the additional item of land tax in the income accounted for 80%, which placed too heavy a burden on farmers, and it was decided to revise it to be fair. Regarding the treatment of public school teachers, it was decided to implement a partial salary in kind (rice) system, that is, each person will be issued one dan of rice to offset 10 yuan of base salary, and the remainder will be issued in accordance with the index promulgated by the central government, without discount or delay. If the above resolution can be put into practice, it will be good news for public school teachers in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Pacification Headquarters Cables Yunnan, Sichuan, Kangding, and Guizhou Provinces to Organize Joint Opium Production Agency</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 11th Dispatch] The Chongqing Pacification Headquarters stated that residents in the four provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, Kangding, and Guizhou mostly engage in opium cultivation and smuggle it for sale, which is a deeply hidden danger. It specially cabled the chairmen of the four provinces to promptly organize a joint opium production agency. It is heard that armed suppression will be carried out to eliminate opium. In addition, Song Jiuxin, the former special commissioner for opium suppression, has been found to be corrupt and derelict in his duties, extorting money from various counties, and has been sent to the local court for legal action.</p>
<h3>Northeast Industrial and Mining Technical Talents' Study Abroad Examination to Be Held in September</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th Dispatch] The issue of sending Northeast industrial and mining technical talents to the United States and Canada for further study has not been resolved due to foreign exchange difficulties. The Northeast Political Affairs Committee has now decided to export a large amount of pig bristles and horse tails to exchange for foreign exchange, which has been negotiated to be transported by air to Tianjin for transit and will be realized in the near future. The budget for the study abroad program requires US$500,000, which is equivalent to 20 billion in circulating currency at the exchange rate. The examination is scheduled for September. Technical talents for overseas internships may go abroad in October.</p>
<h3>The Amount of Japan's Compensation is Far Above US Aid, A Certain Expert Urges the Chinese People Not to Ignore It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A certain expert on Japanese affairs recently said that the Chinese people are currently paying too much attention to US aid and ignoring the issue of Japanese compensation, which is not correct, because Japanese compensation is the right that our country should have obtained after eight years of resistance, and the amount is far above US aid. As of this time, our country has only obtained US$60 million in compensation materials. Officials of the delegation stationed in Japan, who usually do not want to offend the Allied Headquarters, are also unable to bear it at this time and have made public criticisms. It is hoped that the Chinese people and the government can promptly and firmly demand from the US side that the compensation issue be resolved smoothly before the conclusion of the peace treaty. The expert also pointed out that according to the principle of damages, Japan should compensate our country US$65 billion. If calculated according to the principle of ability to compensate under the temporary demolition item, our country should receive US$2 billion, of which US$600 million should be obtained from the distribution of materials from 17 factories. However, due to the US partiality towards Japan, only 10% of this has been obtained so far. In terms of the return of materials, after repeated negotiations, the return of 4,000 tons of copper-nickel coins was finally agreed, but there is still gold worth US$104 million that was looted by the Japanese army during the war that has not yet been agreed to be returned.</p>

If the trip is successful, it will only be a private inspection and he will absolutely not be responsible for any mission. All kinds of rumors circulating outside are rumors.</p>

<h3>Reuters News is Inaccurate; Zhuan Jiaojin States in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Did Not Suggest That the Government Send Troops to Western Yunnan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Zhuan Jiaojin, captain of the Border Survey Team of the Ministry of Interior, responded to reporters on the 11th regarding the news related to the team and the Sino-Myanmar border as reported in Reuters' Nanjing 10th dispatch, saying that the Reuters reporter did not come to interview any news that day. The team was dispatched to Western Yunnan this time, and its mission was purely to technically establish boundary markers, and everything else was not within the team's mission. The Reuters report's so-called suggestion that the government send troops to the Western Yunnan border is inaccurate, and the claim of discovering a silver mine is even more absurd. The only silver mine currently developed on the Sino-Myanmar border is the Lufang Silver Mine. This was jointly developed by China and Britain in the past, and China and Britain signed a contract in 1937. Now Reuters has suddenly released this news, which is indeed detrimental to Sino-Myanmar relations.</p>

<h3>Major Subsidizing Banditry Case Cracked in Baoding; The Main Culprit is Said to Be the Deputy Commander of the Eighth District Security Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 10th Dispatch] Baoding is located on the front line, and smuggling is becoming increasingly rampant. A major smuggling case of subsidizing banditry was uncovered here on the 8th. Four rubber-wheeled carts fully loaded with five large bags of cement were being transported out of the city. When passing through the Shigou checkpoint, they were able to pass smoothly because the company commander of the County Security Regiment stationed there had prior orders from the regimental commander to release them. When they reached Beida Ran Village south of the city, they were intercepted by the People's Service Team of the Qingyuan County Party Committee, and the people and goods were escorted back to the city. It is heard that the main culprit in this case is Li, the deputy commander of the Eighth District Security Forces here, and Tian, the staff officer of the department.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>In your newspaper on the 11th of this month, there was a news item about a major brawl at the Wuxi Railway Station. The content does not entirely align with the actual events. After investigation, it was found that the freight station porters from Wuxi signed a contract in the spring of the 35th year of the Republic to undertake the loading and unloading work at the station. The contract was renewed last year. This year, as all major stations are still in the planning and reorganization phase, a new contract has not yet been signed. The Wuxi porters, seeking to participate in this work, have had disputes with the out-of-town porters for a long time, and numerous attempts at mediation have been unsuccessful. Recently, the Business Section of this office telegraphed both sides' foremen to come to Shanghai on July 31st to discuss the matter at the section. At that time, both sides were still urged to resolve the matter themselves amicably. There were no statements such as "implementing the mediated settlement, cooperating together, and personally instructing the Wuxi porters to resume work soon." Because the mediation case was never established in the first place, how could it be implemented? There was also no way to personally instruct them to resume work soon. This is indeed an inaccurate rumor. Correspondingly, we request a correction. The Transportation Department of the Jinghu District Railway Administration.</p>
<h3>Xu Prefecture's All-Night Storm and Rain, Old Yellow River Floods, Approximately 5,000 Households Homeless</h3>
<p>[Our Xu Prefecture Dispatch on the 11th] The city experienced an all-night storm and thunderstorm on the 10th, which stopped this morning. The Old Yellow River, which runs through the city, suddenly rose and flooded, overflowing its banks. As a result, many prosperous streets in the city were knee-deep in water, and boats could navigate the streets. The thatched huts and mat sheds built by residents along the Yellow River embankment and outside the South Gate were mostly submerged underwater. Approximately 5,000 households are now homeless, making it the biggest flood disaster in over 30 years. The disaster situation is extremely severe. Furthermore, the walls of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters were also submerged by a foot, showing the scale of the flooding. The victims are sleeping in the open air by the water's edge, in a truly miserable state.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Level Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 11th] Although the water level in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been dropping in recent days, the water level in the lower reaches is decreasing very slowly.

Prominent figures from the Northeast also spoke extensively, expressing their opinions on various points. Finally, Mayor Liu Yao-zhang replied, hoping for three things: (1) That the Ministry of Education will promptly resolve the funding and student quotas for the Northeastern Provisional University and Northeastern Provisional Middle School. (2) That the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters will find a way to resolve the issue of school buildings for the Northeastern Provisional University and Northeastern Provisional Middle School as soon as possible. (3) Regarding other sporadic problems of Northeastern students, such as damaging public property and occupying private residences, it is hoped that the Northeastern gentry present will do more to persuade the students.</p>

<h3>Three Envoys Meet with Molotov Again, Negotiations Approaching Decisive Stage, West German Government Formation Plan Delayed, Attitudes of Britain, America, and France Not Unified</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 11th broadcast from Moscow: American Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, along with the British and French envoys, has received new instructions from their governments. They began discussions at the American Embassy at 7 p.m. on the 11th, preparing to meet with Molotov again on the night of the 11th or the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 11th broadcast: Western powers have different views on the four-power talks in the Kremlin. France is slightly optimistic, Britain is pessimistic, and the United States remains tight-lipped, maintaining silence. Some diplomats intend to conflate France's attitude with reports that the Western powers' plans for the West German government have reached a deadlock. Although France has expressed agreement with the London resolutions regarding West Germany, it is quite reluctant and hopes to delay this decisive measure. However, if Britain and the United States want to delay the West German government plan as the price for convening a four-power conference, they will inevitably encounter great difficulties. Almost all British and American newspapers insist that the West must "stand firm" on its plans for West Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th Dispatch] After receiving the latest report on the Kremlin talks, the British Foreign Office continued its usual diplomatic activities today. The American and French ambassadors to Britain held separate talks with Bevin and his chief advisor on German affairs, Strachi, but the three representatives of the so-called "Crisis Committee" did not meet simultaneously. Officials here remain silent on the progress of the negotiations to date, but they have reiterated that Britain does not want to abandon its demand to lift the Berlin blockade, nor does it want to terminate its plans to organize a West German government. Britain and the United States are currently preparing plans to continue the airlift to Berlin this winter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] French Foreign Minister Schumann expressed cautious optimism that the talks between the three-nation representatives and the Moscow authorities have reached a decisive stage. He believes that after Svetlin makes concrete proposals to the three-nation representatives, the Western powers will propose other suggestions and a draft agreement in reply, and he believes that if this draft agreement is satisfactory to both parties, a four-power conference may be held in Paris before the United Nations meeting convenes.

<h3>Little Stalin's Behind-the-Scenes Life (3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by this newspaper's translation department (Originally published in the August 17th issue of the American [Observer Magazine])</p>
<p>Lust for Women, Dissolute Behavior</p>
<p>After being on the front lines for a few months, Vasili had to become depressed, irritable, and bad-tempered. So he often used the excuse of taking short trips to Moscow. There he had a group of directors, actors, and cinematographers ready to fool around with him, drinking, singing, and other wild pleasures. In Moscow, he had a confidant named Carmen, a cinematographer and a man of elegance. He knew how to prepare Chinese dishes, cocktails, and other special drinks. Vasili greatly appreciated these things. However, when Carmen married a young and beautiful woman named Xenia, Vasili immediately fell in love with her and took her to the front lines.</p>
<p>This small incident was the longest-lasting of Vasili's many love affairs. The women he ravaged were simply countless: dancers from the Bolshoi Theatre, movie stars, stage actresses, beautiful female secretaries, and many beautiful girls he met by chance. He took them to villas outside the city, where they could indulge in debauchery and pleasure without being disturbed by others.</p>
<p>Vasili often acted with an air of absolute authority in Moscow. One day, he took a red ballerina into the city in a car, which broke down on the road. He calmly stopped the first car that came along, which happened to belong to a deputy minister. Regardless of everything, he declared that he was Vasili Stalin, kicked all the passengers out of the car, and drove away with his mistress.</p>
<p>On another occasion, in a woman's room, he wanted to call a friend, but it happened that his friend was already talking to someone else. He tried to connect twice but failed, so he ordered the female switchboard operator to cut off their line, which she refused. Angered, Vasili roared, "Do you know who's talking to you? I am Stalin. I'll have you fired tomorrow." His threat came true, and the female switchboard operator was eventually dismissed.</p>
<p>Reprimanded by His Father, His Nature is Hard to Change</p>
<p>There is no doubt that special agents reported Stalin's son's mischief, the scandals in the wine shops, the women he humiliated, and other anecdotes to Stalin at any time. But it was very difficult to stop his wild behavior. Even after Vasili married, he could not be calmed down. Although he had children and his father gave him strict admonitions, he could not change his nature and continued to fool around as before. His father also knew that he sometimes got drunk and couldn't help but express his grievances, such as, "The situation all around is really too miserable... When will we be able to make sure everyone has enough food and clothing?"</p>
<p>Stalin knew about his son's absurdity, but he always cared about his happiness and future. In early 1946, the aging Marshal finally signed the order promoting Vasili to general, so that Vasili could maintain a special position even after his father's death.</p>
<p>The Proletariat Produces a Prodigal Son</p>
<p>Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, is now twenty-four years old and married to a gentle and polite engineer who works in the Planning Commission and is not qualified to hold important government positions. This can make her safer and live a peaceful life. Stalin loved her more than his other children. He not only provided her with unlimited access to cars and all kinds of good food and supplies in the Kremlin stores and commissaries, but also occasionally granted her requests involving political issues.</p>
<p>Svetlana lost her mother early (1932) and was more sensitive than her brother Vasili, growing up in solitude. She devoted herself to studying music, and her favorite piano pieces mostly expressed melancholy and loneliness.</p>
<p>Stalin's eldest son, Yakov, was born when Stalin was very young, and his wife, Svanidze, died in 1907. After Stalin remarried, he gradually forgot about his eldest son, Yakov, because he loved his stepmother, Alyosha, and focused all his attention on the new family. Therefore, Yakov became jealous and angrily returned to his hometown of Georgia, taking up an unimportant position.</p>
<p>Stalin's three children proved the old truth that "extraordinary people rarely have extraordinary children." But Vasili proved a new truth: "The proletariat dictator can also produce a prodigal son." (The End)</p>

<h3>Hu Xinyi's Gold and Banknote Case: Thorough Investigation Reveals Unexpected Evidence; Huge Safe Opened, Nothing Inside</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The black market gold and banknote kingpin, Hu Xinyi, will soon be brought to trial after being prosecuted by the Special Criminal Tribunal's prosecutor. However, a mysterious safe in the case has not yet been opened. According to the rough draft of the day's transactions seized by the police on June 29 from the secret room of Jintai Yarn Company, which was set up by Hu Xinyi at 331 Jiangxi Middle Road, the number of gold bars that had been transacted was recorded to be more than 80. At that time, the police officers in charge saw a huge safe in the shop and speculated that it must contain a large number of gold bars, so they intended to open the safe. However, Hu claimed that the safe belonged to the person in charge of a certain organization and could not be opened without authorization. To be cautious, the police officers immediately placed seals on the safe. After Hu was arrested, the police department, at the request of a financial tycoon, allowed him to be released on bail that night, but he was still summoned and detained the next day. Since then, he has been transferred to the Special Criminal Tribunal for investigation and prosecution. Up to now, this mysterious safe has not been opened. After the case occurred, cases related to the Hu case were also revealed one after another. In order to thoroughly understand the case, the police department, with the approval of the Special Criminal Tribunal, yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the police department, together with a representative of a certain organization, Hu's defense lawyers Li Jinfang and Tian Chang, Li Bojun, and Lai Shengqi, the person in charge of Jintai Yarn Company, went to the shop to jointly open this mysterious safe. Unexpectedly, when the seals were removed and the safe door was opened, it was empty. Everyone believed that this huge and exquisite safe was definitely not for decoration, and it must contain valuable items. Now that it was empty, it was even more suspicious. According to Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the police force, after the incident, he said that he had sufficient evidence to prove Hu's various facts of operating black market gold and banknotes, and although the safe was empty, it could not cover up his crimes.</p>

Some workers died next to the sewing machines, some with clothing materials in their hands as if they were sewing, and some with irons in their hands as if they were ironing. There were also some workers lined up in a long snake formation, leaning against the wall and dying. It must have been because when the fire broke out, they were eager to escape, but the sewing machines in the green room were arranged in rows, blocking the way out. The escapees walked along the machines, but unexpectedly, the flames were approaching and the smoke was thick. The road was narrow and there were many people, making it difficult to escape.

After receiving the alarm, the West District Fire Brigade immediately dispatched a leather belt truck to the scene. The fire was brought under control in about half an hour. As a result, three houses, including Nos. 57, 55, and 53, were completely destroyed, and the other two houses were only scorched on the facade. The losses were heavy. Sun Guohua, the person responsible for the fire, was arrested by the police on duty and taken to the Penglai Police Branch for interrogation.</p>
<h3>National Treasury Bureau Controls Treasury Funds; Giant Sums Withdrawn At One Time; Supporting Documents Required</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently sent a letter to the National Bank's National Treasury Bureau, stating that in order to control treasury funds, each treasury authorized by the National Treasury's competent department to be managed by the National Bank, when there are doubts about the one-time withdrawal of huge sums of money for the purchase of construction materials, food, and other business expenses, supporting documents may be requested from the recipient to verify the authenticity. This restriction should not be applied to fixed regular expenses, employee living subsidies, judicial prisoner food, and student meal fees in national schools, in order to simplify the matter. The National Bank's National Treasury Bureau has sent a circular to its branches to comply with this.</p>

<h3>Facilitating Quick Cargo Pickup for Merchants: Railway Bureau Introduces Delivery of Freight Bills, Scheduled for Implementation in Late June</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, to enhance service and facilitate quick cargo pickup for merchants, has formulated a "Delivery of Freight Bills" method, scheduled for implementation in late June. Sixteen points for attention have been established, and key aspects are outlined below: (1) Restrictions on Delivery of Freight Bills: When consignors entrust the railway to transport goods, except for those requesting issuance of "Pickup Slips" or dispatching escorts, to avoid delays in delivering "Freight Bill" receipt copies and hindering pickup, requests to have the originating station deliver them to the destination station free of charge may be accommodated. However, no letters or other items may be included. (2) Registration of Consignees for Delivered Freight Bills: Consignees who regularly receive delivered "Freight Bills" at a certain station may request registration at the destination station to prevent disputes arising from unauthorized pickup of "Freight Bills" and goods. During registration, the consignee's name or business name, detailed address, and telephone number should be filled in on the "Registration Card for Consignees of Delivered Freight Bills," and the consignee should affix their seal for verification. (3) Requesting Delivery of Freight Bills: When originating stations encounter consignors requesting delivery of freight bill receipt copies, they must have them fill in the "Please Deliver Freight Bill" wording in the special instructions column of the "Consignment Note." The consignee's name or business name and detailed address should be filled in precisely. (4) Freight bills entrusted to this railway for delivery should be sent in the railway's freight bill envelope. (5) Consignors should deliver the freight bill to the station within 20 minutes of receiving it. The station is not responsible for any delays. (6) Arrival notifications are limited to one attempt. The notification slip is divided into two copies, with the first copy given to the consignee as proof of pickup at the station, and the second copy returned to the station for record-keeping. (7) For freight bills delivered by station-dispatched messengers, the standard for calculating storage fees or vehicle demurrage fees is calculated from the time of station notification, after deducting the prescribed free storage or free demurrage time. However, (1) if the consignor causes the delay or (2) if the consignee's address is unclear and notification is impossible, the calculation should begin from the time the goods arrive, deducting the prescribed free time.</p>
<h3>Rising Utility Prices Drive Up Cost of Living: Industrial Sector Hit Twice, Unable to Cope</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] August saw unprecedented surges in utility prices, significantly impacting the cost of living in the first half of this month. The industrial sector, severely affected, finds it unsustainable. Yesterday, a reporter visited a local industrialist who stated: The prices of utilities and rationed rice have increased several times, inevitably driving up the cost of living. The direct and indirect threats to factories are severe. In the current vicious cycle of inflation, the rate of price increases for industrial products is falling behind the increasing costs of raw materials and other expenses. Consequently, factories with weak capital, to survive, have no choice but to devalue and dump their products, a move akin to drinking poison to quench thirst, a form of slow suicide. At the same time, factories with more capital are also suffering significant losses. He believes that the cost of living index is not a primary factor in price increases, as the index is based on prices. He considers the high-percentage increases in utility prices to be a misguided government measure, stating that even if companies are indeed losing money, adjustments should be gradual, rather than suddenly jumping from "loss" to "profit." Utility price hikes directly stimulate the entire market and the lives of all city residents. He strongly supports the city council's position on this matter and hopes for positive outcomes.</p>
<h3>Insurance Industry Seeks to Avert Crisis: Price Index-Linked Dynamic Value Insurance Under Discussion by Association for Imminent Implementation</h3>
<p>The insurance industry is currently facing a severe crisis. Due to soaring prices, the valuation of premiums and compensation is increasingly disconnected, leading to sluggish business for insurance companies, many on the verge of collapse. To maintain value, some policyholders are increasingly purchasing foreign currency-denominated insurance from foreign companies, representing a significant foreign exchange leakage. According to Mr. Luo Beichen, Chairman of the Municipal Insurance Association, the association is considering the introduction of price index-linked insurance and dynamic value insurance to allow policyholders to maintain value in line with prices, benefiting both policyholders and companies. He states that this new insurance system is under discussion by the association and will be implemented in the near future.</p>

<h3>British Tramway Employees Brawl: Trial Concluded, Sentence Set for the 18th: Witnesses on Both Sides Offer Conflicting Accounts, Focus on Bloodstains on Clothing</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the morning of June 20th, Shu Guixiang, a ticket seller from the preparation team of the British Tramway Company, disobeyed the dispatch assignment of Wu Lijun from the Traffic Department and threw an aluminum ticket box at Wu, injuring Wu's left eye. Wu reported this to Mr. Matteson (British), the acting general traffic manager, who dismissed Shu. The next day, Shu led several people to Matteson's office to argue, leading to a verbal confrontation and then a physical fight, resulting in injuries on both sides. Afterward, this triggered a strike by tramway workers. Subsequently, Matteson and Shu filed lawsuits against each other at the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing each other of assault. The prosecutor jointly filed public charges of assault. The case was tried yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Xie Zhiying. Over ten witnesses from both sides, including Liu Xuesai, Wang Jinsheng, Yang Pengsheng, Sun Rongsheng, Wang Jufu, Wang Jiping, Mi Wenliang, Sun Gensheng, Zhou Guisun, Liu Songqi, Zhang Tiegui, Hu Jingrong, Shu Tinghe, and Garth Stone, as well as Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the Tramway Workers' Union, were summoned to court for questioning. Many other workers were present in the courtroom to observe. First, Shu Guixiang testified: "The dispatcher had a grudge against me and did not assign shifts in order. I refused, and the dispatcher became abusive, calling me a 'dung-eater' and a 'pig.' In anger, I preferred not to do business and threw the ticket box, unintentionally injuring him." Matteson testified: "Shu did not follow company rules, and I dismissed him on orders. However, I still told him to appeal at the office, but Shu did not come, so I dismissed him. The next day, Shu came to my office alone, with several other people waiting outside. After Shu entered the room, he started cursing and insulting me. Knowing his intentions were not good, I tried to leave to avoid confrontation. Shu then grabbed my belt and punched me in the chest. At the elevator entrance, Shu again punched me in the head." Shu continued: "When I entered the room to appeal, Matteson, relying on his British power, was aggressive. I had no chance to speak. He punched me first. I grabbed his belt because he had broken my head and wanted to escape. My uniform was covered in blood. At the same time, Garth Stone helped him grab my hands. Only Garth Stone was present as a witness at the time. The other capitalist witnesses present today were all instructed to come." Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the Union, stated: "After this incident, the Union considered it a labor dispute and had the right to mediate. Wu Lijun and Shu Guixiang had both accepted mediation, but Matteson still insisted on dismissing Shu, which violated decades of company practice." The court then questioned Matteson's witnesses Sun Rongsheng, Wang Yafu, Garth Stone, and eleven others, who all stated firmly that Shu had indeed slapped Matteson. However, they did not know where the bloodstains on Shu's clothing came from. Shu Guixiang's witnesses, including Liu Xuesai and several others, also stated in the same tone that they had indeed seen Garth Stone grab Shu's hand and had seen Shu's clothes stained with blood. Shi Xueshan, a plainclothes police officer from the Huangpu Branch, said: "There was a fight, but I was not present at the time, so I couldn't determine who hit whom." At this point, the focus of the court's interrogation was concentrated on the bloodstains on Shu's clothing. After repeated questioning of both sides, the trial seemed to have some clues. The prosecutor then stood up and stated the intent of the indictment. After the lawyers made their arguments, the court announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Swallows Corrosive Liquid in Front of Bank, Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11:00 AM, in front of the Bank of China on the Bund at Number 17, a 66-year-old woman swallowed nitric acid and collapsed. She was discovered and rushed to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. Whether she can survive the ordeal is uncertain. It is reported that the old woman lives in the kitchen of Number 6, Lane 1, Xinzha Road. The reason for her suicide attempt is unknown.</p>
<h3>Entrusted House: Cuckoo Occupies Nest: Xing Weide Sued for Forgery</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Guo Congshan, a local resident who formerly served in the Third War Zone, was transferred to Shanghai with the army in October of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945) when the war of resistance was won. In October of the same year, the Japanese Military Supplies Receiving Committee allocated a house at 18C Huangdu Road to Guo for residence. In March of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), Guo was transferred to Guam by the Materials Supply Bureau, and he entrusted the house to his friend Xing Weide for safekeeping and residence. After Xing moved into the house, he forged a letter purportedly written by Guo Congshan himself on April 30 of the same year to the China Trust Bureau, stating: "I previously used a house at 18C Huangdu Road rented by your bureau. Because I am about to leave Shanghai and no longer need it, I am willing to unconditionally offer it for use by the China Economic Research Institute, and please be responsible for its safekeeping. Please collect the required fees directly from the institute, and I am not involved." After the transfer procedure was completed, Xing then occupied the nest like a cuckoo. When Guo returned to Shanghai and found out, negotiations were ineffective, so he filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing Xing of trespassing, obstructing his rights, and forgery. The office has concluded its investigation, dismissing the charges of trespassing and obstructing rights because the plaintiff had not yet obtained proper lease rights to the house, which should be resolved in civil court. However, Xing was indicted on charges of forgery.</p>

<h3>Municipal Primary School Staff Request Collection of Advanced Study Fees: Director Li Promises to Consider</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Primary School Staff Association, to request the continued collection of teacher advanced study fees for the next semester, sent representatives Li Zhanren, Tu Shiling, Qian Shenzhi, Huang Zhuyu, and Cao Junshi to the Bureau of Education yesterday morning to meet with Director Li. Director Li stated that he has always believed that the collection of advanced study fees from municipal schools increases the burden on parents and hopes they will not make this request. The representatives repeatedly stated the reasons for the collection, believing that although the collection of advanced study fees from municipal schools seems to increase the burden on parents, its importance lies in stabilizing the lives of teachers and increasing educational efficiency. If teacher salaries can indeed maintain their pre-position standards, there would be no need to make this request. Although salaries are currently based on the cost of living index, the base salary is too low, and monthly income is not even enough for two shi of white rice. If the bureau insists on not collecting advanced study fees, how can teachers' lives be stabilized and how can education in this city be advanced? After more than half an hour of explanation, Director Li said that he would consider it. It is reported that the Bureau of Education will invite representatives from all sectors of the city and the principals and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools to seriously discuss whether to continue collecting advanced study fees for the next semester within the next few days.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Land Reform in the Brewing Stage</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou, 9th] Chen Gongzhi has been in charge of Zhejiang's government for a month. Chen, upon taking office, spoke to reporters about his policy guidelines, stating that they would ensure security and increase production. In Chen's new policies over the past month, apart from the document reform that has materialized, the so-called two major policy guidelines remain at the stage of "hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs." In fact, these two basic guidelines were what the previous chairman, Shen Chengzhang, wanted to do, tried to do, but failed to do well. Chen's new approach to Zhejiang, the real new hope for the people of Zhejiang, lies in the land reform movement that is in the brewing stage.</p>
<p>The reason for Zhejiang's current widespread poverty and unrest in the countryside cannot be denied as having significant political factors. However, objectively analyzing, the decline (or even near collapse) of the rural economy and the lack of security for tenant farmers are the main keys. Chairman Chen also understands this very well. His advocacy of economic construction and increased production aims to curb the source of unrest by boosting the local economy and stabilizing people's lives, which is undoubtedly a fundamental solution. However, relying solely on economic construction with plans but without funding is like trying to put out a fire with water from afar. The most fundamental solution is still Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposed "equalization of land ownership." Zhejiang is a province of farmers, and the farmer problem (i.e., the land problem) should be rationally resolved.</p>
<p>Content of the Plan Not Yet Revealed</p>
<p>In fact, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has always paid close attention to the farmer problem and has made greater efforts than other provinces in how to use land and rationally allocate the interests of tenant farmers and landlords. "25% Rent Reduction" was first implemented in Zhejiang. After twenty years of effort, the 25% rent reduction has been widely implemented throughout the province. (This is also one of the important reasons why Zhejiang's security is better than that of neighboring provinces today.) However, in today's situation, relying solely on 25% rent reduction is not enough to stabilize the countryside. Therefore, when Chairman Chen spoke about the rural economic problem at his first press conference on the evening of July 16, he stated that he would pilot a moderate land reform. The plan for implementing this reform has been handed over to the Land Administration Bureau for drafting, but it has not yet been approved, and the provincial government has always kept the content of this plan a secret. There are two views on this from the outside: one is that Chairman Chen is cautious in his work, and the other is that he is afraid of offending landlords and causing opposition from local forces.</p>
<p>Four Principles to Maintain Moderation</p>
<p>How moderate will Chen's land reform be? Although it can be understood from the four principles of the plan: (1) Handling the contract registration of land, implementing the 25% rent reduction thoroughly based on the registration, and protecting the interests of tenant farmers. (2) Limiting the maximum amount of land owned by individuals and groups. Excess land will be purchased by the government and resold to tenant farmers. (3) Land not owned by landlords, wasteland, and other land, or land whose purchase is applied for by tenant farmers, or land that is not legally used in accordance with government regulations, will be purchased by the government in accordance with the law and transferred to tenant farmers. (4) The government will use large areas of wasteland and tidal flats to establish self-cultivation cooperative farms, recruiting poor farmers and tenant farmers to cultivate them. The prerequisites for this principle are: (1) Carrying out the reform legally, and (2) Not harming the rights and interests of the owners.</p>
<p>Sorting Out Land Registry: Expediting Registration</p>
<p>Let's not talk about whether the degree is enough. As long as the government is determined to do it, and does it quickly and effectively, then that's very good. Speaking of doing it, the first difficulty encountered is that the government does not have a list of land ownership in the whole province and does not know who owns how much land. This is the problem of land registry sorting. The central government allocates Zhejiang's measurement funds for sorting out land registry, only enough for fifty mu per year, while the province has 150 million mu of land. In other words, it will take three hundred years to complete the land survey. Therefore, only local funds can be raised, and the central government prohibits the additional collection of land taxes, making it difficult to handle the land registry under such dual constraints. Fortunately, Hong Jichuan, the director of Zhejiang's Land Administration Bureau, is a visionary and capable person with the courage to act. He sought help from the public opinion organs, and with the consent of the provincial and county councils, he collected land registry sorting fees on the grain tax (which was approved by the central government as a separate local law for each province after discussions at last year's National Land Administration Conference.) In the past three years, twenty-one counties have been completed, plus the twenty counties that were completed before and during the war, totaling forty-one counties. Compared with other provinces, it is already a brilliant achievement, but it is still far from the degree needed. Therefore, how to expedite registration in counties where surveying has been completed but land registration has not been done, and how to quickly complete land registration in counties where land registry has not been sorted out, is the current new issue for the Land Administration Bureau. The key to this lies in effectively cooperating with local people and in the soundness of grassroots politics. As long as the grassroots politics are sound, those township and village heads who are landlords or property owners can have a long-term vision and cooperate to promote it, and it will be easy to do. However, the personnel constraints in Chinese politics are often the fatal injuries of such things.</p>
<p>Going Deep into the People: Propaganda and Investigation</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chen decided to set up propagandists in various counties and cities to go deep into the people and promote government orders. I think that if Chairman Chen has the determination and courage to carry out land reform, he can take advantage of these propagandists to go deep into every corner of the countryside and directly investigate land owners from the farmers (mainly tenant farmers). Since land reform is to help tenant farmers and find ways for tenant farmers, the investigation will be carried out smoothly and quickly. As for the formulation of the maximum limit, it should be determined based on the abundance and poverty of the soil, so the problem is not in the rigid stipulation of ten mu or twenty mu, but in having a correct investigation first. Otherwise, landlords can still use means of concealing the truth to privately preserve their land.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the problem of funds. The government must prepare a huge fund to purchase the property of landlords, and in fact, tenant farmers are unable to purchase land in one go, so they must be allowed to purchase land in installments. In addition, the establishment of self-cultivation cooperative farms also requires huge funds, so this fund is quite large and must be raised by issuing land bonds or other means.</p>
<p>Pilot Projects in Wuxing and Other Counties</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the implementation of land reform, the provincial government has decided to pilot it first in Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Chongde, Tongxiang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haining, Haiyan, and other counties in one district where security is good and land registry has been sorted out. According to my personal observation, the purpose of land reform is to help tenant farmers, eliminate poor farmers, and make them self-cultivating farmers, so as to curb the source of unrest, and the biggest source of unrest is precisely in the mountainous and poor counties where security is poor and banditry is rampant. Therefore, to curb the source of unrest and stabilize the countryside, it seems that it should be started from the counties where security is worrying and the counties with more poor farmers.</p>
<p>In short, Chairman Chen's moderate land reform plan is a great contribution of his new policies to the people of Zhejiang, and the farmers who cultivate the land in Zhejiang are looking forward to this promising prospect.</p>
<h3>Tragedy at Hangzhou Zhenxing Iron Shop: Erroneously Hammering a Grenade Leads to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou, 11th] An explosion tragedy occurred in Hangzhou's Baoyou Bridge . The Zhenxing Iron Shop erroneously hammered a hand grenade, killing four members of the family and seriously injuring five others.</p>
<h3>Prohibition and Trafficking of Opium: A Sole Monopoly</h3>
<p>Yao Yinglong Detained in Chongqing</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 11th] The Chongqing security authorities on the 11th detained Yao Yinglong, a Major General High Staff Officer of the active Xichang Police Department, who is involved in a widespread case. Yao formerly served as the Special Commissioner for Opium Prohibition in Xikang under the Ministry of Interior. He arrived in Chongqing from Kangding and Ya'an. According to a report from the current Special Commissioner for Opium Prohibition in Xikang, Song Shuofu, Yao is suspected of serious crimes involving the protection and trafficking of narcotics. He was about to flee from Chongqing when security personnel, acting on this lead, arrested Yao at a certain hotel. Sources close to Song Shuofu stated that Song left Chongqing for Chengdu on the 11th to investigate and collect relevant evidence in this case.</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Sixty Counties of Jiangxi; Particularly Disastrous Along the Shores of Poyang Lake; Special Commissioner Song Xunxin on Disaster Relief States that Water Recession and Resumption of Farming Are Unlikely in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch on the 11th] Song Xunxin, the Special Commissioner for Disaster Relief from the Ministry of Social Affairs, recently accompanied Xue Qiuquan, Director of the Social Affairs Office, and others to inspect the disaster situation in Nanchang and counties along the shores of Poyang Lake, such as Yugan and Jinxian. He returned to the province from Yingtan on the evening of the 9th. According to Song, there are now reports of flooding in sixty counties of Jiangxi Province, with the disaster being truly severe, particularly along the shores of Poyang Lake, and slightly less severe in southern Jiangxi. In the disaster areas, many people's fields and houses are still submerged. Seventy to eighty percent of the early rice harvest was lost due to flooding, and autumn crops cannot be planted as the floodwaters have not receded. Although a very small number of upland fields have been cultivated for autumn crops, they have recently withered due to severe heat and lack of rain. Judging from the current water levels, it is unlikely that the counties along the shores of Poyang Lake will see water recession and resumption of farming in the short term, as the Changjiang River's water level has not significantly decreased, preventing Poyang Lake from draining. Xue Qiuquan also deeply felt that this year's agricultural production in the Poyang Basin is almost hopeless, affecting the province's overall grain production and people's livelihoods. They both believe that issues such as epidemic prevention, medical care, dike restoration, and resumption of farming after this great disaster should be addressed with countermeasures to save the nearly ten million disaster victims. Song concluded by saying that it is strange that the Jiangxi disaster, despite its severity, has not attracted attention from people in society. For example, even though the Jiangxi floods have been ongoing, the provincial government did not report the disaster to the central government before [officials] left Beijing. The Ministry of Social Affairs' initial allocation of 35 billion [currency units] was made on its own initiative. Even the recent disaster reports submitted have not been prepared in accordance with the central government's regulations, failing to provide a factual record of the disaster and statistical figures, making it difficult for the central government to provide relief. Song and others are scheduled to go to Jiujiang and Hukou on the 12th for further disaster assessment.</p>

(2) Jia Ronglan, an obstetrician, committed negligent homicide during delivery, causing the placenta of the parturient Jin Shi to retract, resulting in death. (3) The renowned doctor Gao Enpei killed Han Qing, the director of a barber shop, with a single injection. The news spread, causing public outcry. It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Health Authorities, the Provincial and County Medical Associations, and the Midwives Association are paying close attention to this and are jointly dispatching personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter and make it public after the incident is clarified.</p>
<h3>The Corpse of a Glamorous Woman Found on Hui Mountain in Wuxi; Tour Guide Li Meiyu Was Disfigured and Strangled</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch on the 10th] Li Meiyu, a tour guide from the "Good Friends" guiding agency at No. 4 Youhui Lane, Tongyun Road, went to Hui Mountain with two clients on the afternoon of the 7th. Late at night, on the summit of Ermao Peak, the murderer strangled Meiyu and stole her jewelry. The body was discovered by a woodcutter on the morning of the 8th. Yesterday, the deceased's husband, Yu Baoyi, rushed to Wuxi from Suzhou after hearing the news, and identified the corpse as his wife at Hui Mountain. He reported the matter to the local prosecutor's office for investigation. It was confirmed that she had been disfigured and strangled. Li Meiyu was 24 years old, originally from Suzhou, and had received elementary school education. She married Yu five years ago. Due to poverty, she was forced to come to Wuxi as a tour guide. However, the couple's relationship was very close, and Meiyu was frugal, saving a small amount of money, which led to the covetousness of criminals. On the morning of the incident, Meiyu and her husband had a private conversation at the Jinan Hotel. When her husband returned to Suzhou that afternoon, Meiyu had already left, dressed up, and never returned. At the scene where Meiyu was killed, there were two large stones, and the feet of the corpse were in a shallow mud puddle. The surrounding grass was sparse, and the footprints were chaotic, indicating that the deceased had struggled desperately when she was attacked. According to her husband, Yu Baoyi, the deceased was wearing two gold bracelets, two gold rings, a watch, and a full gold lock pendant chain, all of which were stolen. The court has issued an order to the military and police agencies to cooperate in arresting the murderer and bringing him to justice.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Ships Large Amounts of Cash; Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals Lifted; Money Supply Trends Slightly Tight, Bank Branches Show Varied Performances</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Previously, the Central Bank, due to a severe shortage of cash in the city, stipulated that withdrawals by financial institutions were limited to one-tenth of their total deposits. This measure was implemented on a trial basis for one day on the 9th, and the results proved to be very difficult in practice. Bank branches found it especially difficult to pay customers. It is now learned that the Central Bank has shipped large amounts of cash, so the restriction on cash withdrawals has been lifted.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the money supply trend was slightly tight yesterday. Although the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury were mostly net debit in the interbank clearing of bills, the Central Bank had a net credit of 365.72 billion, so the average net credit was still 149.03 billion. The Bank of China had a net debit of 57.94 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net debit of 79.79 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net debit of 24.43 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a net debit of 59.81 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a net debit of 15.90 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net credit of 21.18 billion, the commercial banks had a large clearing net debit of 19.75 billion, the small clearing net debit of 54.64 billion, and foreign banks had a total net credit of 103.20 billion.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Top Grade White Rice Again Hits a High Price of 50 Million</h3>
<p>Rice prices continued to rise, and the increase was stronger than before. As the prices of other commodities had risen far more than rice, public sentiment was already very bullish. Coupled with the strong rise in the tin market, merchants tried hard to increase prices. The morning market saw an increase of 4 to 5 million. Top-grade white rice again hit 50 million, thin paddy rice reached 53 million, and new rice from Pudong also reached as high as 50 million. At the close, as the prices of various external commodities weakened and sentiment turned weaker, the outbound movement was also stagnant. The closing price dropped back by 2 million. Yesterday, the registered arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 6,418 piculs.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>After an initial rise, prices retreated. The morning opening continued the momentum of the previous day's rise, and the market remained firm. Merchants continued to increase prices. The old stock opened at 19 million in the morning market. Later, due to the decline in external grains, the number of deliveries decreased, and the closing price retreated to 18.1 million. The closing price of the "Warship" brand was 17.8 million, an increase of 5 to 6 million compared to the previous day. Bran rose sharply by 1 million. Small bags of bran reached 10 million in the afternoon market. The factory price of wheat opened at 24 million.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<p>Prices rose. As the demand from out-of-town buyers remained strong, merchants continued to raise prices. The morning market was firmer, but the closing price also turned softer. Soybeans, favored by out-of-town buyers, increased by 2 million. New soybeans were only sold locally, and the market lacked prosperity. Corn increased by 1 million. Buyers from Shantou have stopped buying Yuanmai, but buyers from the North have not stopped, and prices are still increasing by 1 million. Mung beans and broad beans each increased by 2 million as merchants pushed up prices. Sesame was in short supply. White sesame increased by 4 to 5 million, and Yuanmai increased by nearly 10 million. Raw peanuts were losing momentum among buyers from Guangdong, and prices slightly decreased by 2 million.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Prices returned to a stable path. Although the opening price in the morning still saw a continued increase, the local market reduced purchases due to high prices. Furthermore, as external commodities generally retreated, individual investors turned bearish and sold off. Soybean oil retreated from 140 million to close at 134 million, a slight decrease of 1 million. Vegetable oil was stable, and sesame oil transactions were dull, with a slight increase of 1 million. Soybean cake transactions were lackluster, and the outbound movement was dull, with a setback of 200,000 to 300,000.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest in Export Tea</h3>
<p>The foreign tea market inherited the upward momentum of the previous day. In addition, due to the continued strong buying interest from exporters, the price control was unchecked, and the trend continued to show vitality. Quotations continued to shine brilliantly. However, trading lacked luster due to the scarcity of various goods in stock. It is reported that the Keemun black tea of this year, since the Anhui Tea Company and Zhenhe Tea Firm actively transported it from the production area, will soon arrive in Shanghai. Local tea merchants in this city are also planning to rush the shipment of tea from Wutun and other major brands from the production areas, which is indeed a genuine need.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Increase Again in Price</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The selling price of foreign exchange settlement certificates rose again yesterday. After opening at 6.05 million, it rose in a straight line and exceeded the 7 million mark. Later, as merchants sold off at high prices, it returned to around 6.8 million.</p>
<p>Officials stated that the increase in the price of foreign exchange settlement certificates was due to the large demand from importers and was unrelated to the government. In addition, the recent increase in the price of foreign exchange settlement certificates has also had a considerable stimulating effect on overseas remittances. According to news from the Overseas Chinese Remittance Bureau, the income from overseas remittances in July nearly doubled compared to June.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Domestic Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The domestic exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be adjusted from the 12th as follows: Xiamen 400 yuan, Fuzhou 300 yuan, Quanzhou 400 yuan, Guangzhou 400 yuan, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning each 250 yuan, Lianyungang 70 yuan, Xufu and Wanxian each 450 yuan, Nanchang 180 yuan, Jiujiang 180 yuan, Ji'an and Ganzhou each 250 yuan, Haimen and Linhai each 100 yuan, and Yunnan 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Discounted Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee Held Its 18th Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee of the Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 18th meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. More than ten people, including Zhang Zimin, attended the meeting. They discussed three transportation projects, eight public utility projects, three mining projects, six industrial projects, and two temporary proposals. They were rejected or transferred for discounting separately. The Discount Committee will make the final decision next Monday.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Rise and Freight Rates Are Expensive; Textile Mills Lack Purchasing Power</h3>
<p>It is learned that after Shaanxi cotton was banned from being transported out of the province on July 1 for military use, the government designated the China Textile Corporation and the Cotton Monopoly Council to supply 36,000 dan, and the Farmers Bank to supply 4,000 dan, totaling 40,000 dan. All of these were collected within half a month, so Shaanxi cotton has now been reopened for outward transportation. To date, more than 1,500 tons have been successively shipped out. However, the difficulties encountered after Shaanxi cotton was reopened for outward transportation were more than before.</p>
<p>(1) The selling price of Shaanxi cotton at the end of June was 93 million per dan. After the reopening, the price suddenly soared to 210 million. In addition, the freight from Baoji to Chongqing is 380 million per ton, and the freight from Chongqing to Shanghai is also very high. Thus, after Shaanxi cotton is shipped to Shanghai, its selling price will be more expensive than the price of cotton in Shanghai, which will stimulate the price of cotton in Shanghai. Each textile mill now has no power to sell in.</p>
<p>(2) More than 1,500 tons that were recently shipped to Chongqing were suddenly ordered to be detained by the Chongqing Municipal Government on the grounds that Chongqing lacks cotton. The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association believes that this action by the Chongqing Municipal Government is illegal and has lodged a serious protest with the local government, demanding its return, and hoping that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The wealthy households in Shaanxi have a large amount of cotton stored, about 200,000 "zu" (a unit of weight, likely local usage) or so, and are unwilling to sell, wanting to save it until the new cotton is purchased in October before selling it. The Shaanxi Provincial Government has no appropriate way to deal with these hoarders. Combining the above practical difficulties, the prospects for Shaanxi cotton being shipped to Shanghai are not optimistic.</p>
<p>In addition, Shaanxi cotton is indeed a bumper year this year, with a total output of up to 1.2 million dan, more than last year. If it can be transported to Shanghai in large quantities, the textile mills will not have to worry about a cotton shortage.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Yarn Market Weakens; Textile Fabrics Are Abundant, and Transactions Turn Lackluster</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was weak. Because the shipping costs were soaring, merchants felt that the prices were too expensive, and demand turned dull. Furthermore, as the financial situation within the industry tightened, speculative longs successively sold off, causing the market to weaken, and sentiment also turned weak.</p>
<p>When the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened, it was said that the price of Longtou fine cloth continued to be outstanding, and sentiment was firm, so the asking price was still high. After the opening, as external commodities fell back, there were more sellers in the market. It finally appeared at 2.85 billion for immediate sale, with 80 million left for delivery tomorrow. The closing price was more than 100 million lower than the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also declined by 20 to 30 million, or about 10%. One hundred and twenty lots were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was slack due to the tightening of credit in the market and the news that private factories were producing a considerable amount. The supply of goods felt abundant, and police were stationed in the market, so transactions turned scarce.</p>
<p>The 12-pound Longtou fine cloth, in the morning, continued the momentum of the previous day, rising by more than 2 million. As credit was still loose, transactions were booming. The market price rose again to 79.5 million, with transactions. At 10 o'clock, hearing that the stock and yarn markets had fallen sharply, northern merchants suddenly switched to selling, and large investors and speculative longs sold off to take profits. The atmosphere in the market suddenly became thicker. The market abruptly turned weak, closing at 77.5 million, but still increasing by 2.7 million compared to the previous day (1.5 million lower than the external settlement price of the previous day).</p>
<p>It is also reported that the upward momentum strengthened again in the afternoon, and external materials also rose. The asking price for Longtou fine cloth reappeared at the 80 million mark, and again reached a new high of 81 million, 3.5 million higher than the morning settlement price. The Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji also rose by 3.5 million compared to the afternoon closing price.</p>
<p>In addition, the prices of medium-grade fine cloths such as the Five Blessings Loudspeaker were also up by 1.56 million to 2.5 million. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth, stimulated by the increase in dyes, saw an increase of up to 15 million for high-end goods. The market for other cloths was also firm.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the China Textile Corporation yesterday sold seven types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee in the cotton yarn market, allowing 31 households to purchase. 124 lots were sold, worth 21,547,000,000. The China Textile Corporation also issued 405 purchase permits yesterday, selling 602 lots of cotton yarn, equivalent to 1377.5 lots of 20-count yarn, worth 151.08 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>This Month's Commodity Tax Increases Sharply; The Total for the Month Could Reach More Than 10 Trillion</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Commodity Tax Bureau, commodity tax revenue has greatly improved since the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau strengthened tax collection. The revenue for August, as of yesterday, has reached over 8.4 trillion, an increase of more than 4 trillion compared to the total revenue for the previous month. The cigarette tax alone accounted for approximately 3 trillion, nearly one-third of the total tax revenue. It is expected that the total by the end of the month will reach more than 10 trillion, which will benefit Shanghai's finances. Furthermore, due to the continuous rise in prices, the commodity tax figures for September will be even larger.</p>
<p>It is also reported that according to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, the Direct Commodity and Business Tax Bureau has been merged into the National Tax Bureau. It has now been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance that all expenses and subsidies originally allocated to the Direct Commodity and Business Tax Bureau in each district from July to September of this year may be transferred by each bureau from the amounts that have been allocated but not yet used, by issuing public treasury checks, to the National Tax Bureau in the same area for receipt. The accounts will be established in the name of the National Tax Bureau and continue to be used.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Association Convenes Members' Representative Meeting</h3>
<p>The joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Commercial Association resolved to convene the Third Members' Representative Meeting at the Central Vegetable Society on Fuzhou Road on the afternoon of the 28th of this month, to re-elect half of the directors and supervisors and discuss important proposals for the industry. In accordance with the regulations of the Shanghai Social Groups, the preparatory meeting will be convened in advance by district to elect attending representatives. It is scheduled to be held from the 16th to the 23rd of this month, every afternoon at the same location, in the designated geographical districts. It is heard that the total number of member representatives of the association is more than 2,500. According to the regulations promulgated by the Social Bureau, more than 120 attending representatives can be produced. The number of seats is small, and there is no shortage of candidates competing.</p>
<h3>Relaxing the Scale of Overseas Chinese Investment; The Import-Export Management Committee Suggests Two Points</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the Import-Export Management Committee, since the promulgation of the Measures to Encourage Overseas Chinese Investment, the government has solicited opinions from the industrial and commercial sectors. It is now learned that the Import-Export Management Committee has submitted two proposed revisions based on the application of the industrial sector and requested approval from the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>The revised measures are: (1) The raw materials allowed to be imported by overseas Chinese investment must be coordinated with the needs of domestic manufacturers, that is, domestic production institutions may directly enter into contracts with overseas Chinese investors, and with the permission of the competent authorities, directly transport the raw materials to domestic production enterprises so that supply and demand are coordinated.</p>
<p>(2) For cases where the raw materials and national currency funds imported by overseas Chinese investment are used to establish new factories, in consideration of the actual situation, the time limit will be extended from six months to one year. The relaxation of the scale of returning overseas Chinese investment can increase the supply of domestic materials and achieve the goal of encouraging production.</p>
<h3>National Medicines Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, due to exchange rate issues, costs have been significantly affected. Market prices have uniformly risen. Cardamom of various grades has risen sharply. Superior grade cardamom is 14 million, Grade 1 selected cardamom is 10 million, Grade 2 selected cardamom is 9 million, top purple cardamom is 7.5 million, and raw cardamom is 6 million. Golden seal Zhuye is 42 million, three-top is 38 million, double-top is 24 million, top-grade blood amber is 16 million, and upper blood amber is 6 million. Qingjiapian is 4.8 million, Dongshaoyao king is 10 million to 6 million, Xuanhu is 4 million to 1.6 million, and Jingheche (likely referring to placenta) is opening at 300,000, all creating unprecedented new highs.</p>
<h3>Local Business Conditions</h3>

<h3>Weakness Mid-Course, Chinese Stocks Recovered at Close</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were initially weak but later strong yesterday. Concerns were widespread, causing yarn and cloth to decline in the morning market. The drop intensified near noon, especially affecting smaller stocks. Hong Kong Telecom shares reached new lows, completely changing the outlook. However, they recovered at the close, with stocks like China Flour Mill (華豐) hitting the upper limit.</p>
<p>In the morning, inheriting the previous day's momentum and fueled by rumors of large-scale capital inflows, the market opened relatively flat. Wing On Textiles (永紗) started at $156,50 yuan, while most smaller stocks opened lower. As flexible deposit measures failed to materialize and negotiations for U.S. loans intensified, shares of stocks like No. 152, No. 179, No. 176, No. 22, No. 102, and No. 76 were sold down to $153,50 yuan. Stocks like No. 141, No. 220, No. 45, No. 12, No. 65, No. 205, No. 224, No. 60, No. 54, and No. 207 still attracted buyers, pushing the price to a new high of $159,50 yuan. Trading in yarn and cloth started normally, with stocks like No. 154, No. 226, No. 71, No. 153, No. 176, No. 137, No. 152, No. 129, No. 207, and No. 76 being settled, gradually declining. Stocks like No. 206, No. 156, No. 224, No. 14, No. 102, No. 116, and No. 152 were sold down to $151,50 yuan, with No. 151, No. 54, No. 76, and No. 95 being bought back, rising to $154,00 yuan. The price of yarn and cloth fell significantly, causing widespread panic due to large inventories. It was anticipated that the National Bank would intervene further. Stocks like No. 152, No. 23, No. 61, No. 98, No. 89, No. 119, No. 203, No. 60, and No. 226 were sold down to $149,70 yuan, while No. 143, No. 179, and No. 160 were maintained. Rumors spread of Hong Kong Telecom shrinking and exchange settlement certificates rising. The midday close was $151,20 yuan. King Fook (景福) struggled to sell stock No. 220 due to the power of Hing Yip (興業), further weakening the market. Smaller stocks inevitably became more fragile. Ultimately, Tung Yih (統益) was the only one to close at the upper limit. Wu Foo (五和) Match and China United Chemical Industries (華新) rose slightly, while Commercial Press (商務) remained flat. New Kwong (新光), Tung Hing (動興), and Chapei (閘北) fell by 10%, while others suffered smaller declines ranging up to 5%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Wing On Textiles opened at $154,50 yuan. Although stocks like No. 114, No. 185, and No. 131 were offered, Hong Kong Telecom shares reached a new low of $0.05. Stocks like No. 16, No. 137, No. 65, No. 224, No. 192, No. 129, No. 97, No. 4, No. 117, No. 225, No. 206, No. 220, No. 207, No. 190, No. 3, and No. 169 were actively bought. Despite a slight retracement mid-course and the National Bank's intervention, external stimulus suddenly arose. With the strong buying of No. 169 and No. 190, Wing On Textiles rose to close at $163,20 yuan. China Corporation (華曁) was aggressively purchased from No. 107, attracting many followers and soaring to the upper limit. Other stocks also saw gains, with Tung Yih and Union Land (聯地) closing at the upper limit. Compared to the morning close, besides the three stocks closing at the upper limit, Sin Yih (信誼), Dah Chong (大通), and Wu Foo did not open. Mei Lin (梅林) and Wing Kung (永公) rose slightly, while Wing Feng (榮豐) and Banque Franco-Chinoise (中法) rose by 5%. The remaining stocks generally increased by 0.5% to 1%.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading was in a stalemate. The morning opening for Unified C (統丙) was 1.83 million, rising to 1.86 million before falling back to 1.75 million. A slight rise was seen near the close, but the fluctuations were narrow, and trading volume was very low. Room 500 and Cheng Teh (承德) sold, while Room 552 and Room 503 bought. As a result, compared to the previous close, A, B, and D grades were flat, while C and E grades were slightly down by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange</p>
<p>The stock exchange announced yesterday that, effective immediately, market trading hours would be from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM and from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM. There would be no afternoon session on Saturdays.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The silk market initially rose but then softened. Initially, due to the sharp rise in silk prices, the market continued the overnight gains and saw further upward momentum. Ta Cheng (大誠) crepe once reached 1.8 billion yuan, but ultimately closed at 1,775 million yuan, a gain of 11 million yuan. Over-the-counter bidding remained small.</p>
<p>The sugar market rose and then slightly declined. Initially, news of the Taiwan dollar rising again boosted confidence, and the market continued the previous night's gains, rising further. Later, due to reports of falling prices in the North Market, selling increased, and the market declined. Chang Paiqing (章白情) and the sugar guild formed a combined position, with both doing 73.8 million yuan tomorrow. Native sugar prices continued to rise.</p>
<p>Mineral oil prices have stabilized, with the overall market price lower than the bank price. For example, Mobil motor oil is sold by banks for over 500 million yuan, while the market price is only 420 million yuan. Gasoline in drums can be purchased for 3.5 million yuan per gallon, but some retailers still ask for 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>As the price difference between the production price and the Shanghai market for asphalt is very small, not many goods are arriving from the source. Local soap factories and candle manufacturers are repeatedly making inquiries, with soap factories accounting for the larger demand. The seventh lunar month is usually the peak season for candle manufacturing, but due to weak purchasing power and high surcharges, sales are not as high as last year. Ho Pen (禾本) is asking for 220 million yuan, while plain oil (平油) and orchid oil (蘭油), the high-end goods, also require 200 million to 210 million yuan.</p>
<p>Singapore coconut oil, with its cost of arrival (based on Hong Kong prices plus tax) higher than the market price, and the constant demand from soap factories, the market conditions are firm. Yesterday's market was still asking for 280 million yuan, with traders doing 270 million yuan. Butter arrivals were few, and transactions were not active.</p>
<p>Fluorescent lamps are in high demand due to the high prices of gold and banknotes on the black market, leading to bullish sentiment. A 48-inch General Electric blue fluorescent tube has risen to 27.5 million yuan per tube. Similarly, Sylvania has risen to 22 million yuan, with a general increase of 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty regarding the delivery schedule of Wing Tai Wo (永泰和) cigarettes, retail sales are good. Various factories are not calculating costs, and with the hype from racketeers, market prices have risen again. Ten Great Britain cigarettes are now priced at 8.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Soap prices have also been boosted by the soaring cigarette prices. In addition, rising raw material costs mean that various factories are not calculating costs. A transaction for Gu Ben (固本) soap was made at 76 million yuan, and there were buyers for Henry soap at 61 million yuan.</p>
<p>Although sales of building materials remain weak, sentiment has gradually turned firm. Large blue bricks are still priced at 520 million yuan, requiring extra cartage fees. Cement prices in the market have also firmed up, with transactions at 9 million yuan per bag plus 400,000 yuan cartage fees. Some are asking 100 million yuan for felt, but the actual market price is between 85 million and 90 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Our Basketball Team Defeats Great Britain by a Landslide, Today's Final Against Italy, Wonderful Coordination with Constant Applause</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 11th Broadcasting: The Chinese basketball team recently defeated the British team 54-25 in the third-tier qualifying round, and will compete with the Italian team, which defeated Egypt, in the final on Thursday for 17th place.</p>
<p>China consistently fielded its starting five of Bao Songyuan (包松圓), Huang Tianxi (黃天錫), Zang Wenhua (葬文華), Li Shiqiao (李世僑), and Wu Chengzhang (吳成章). The British players were physically imposing, but their skills were mediocre. The Chinese team controlled the entire game, consistently taking the lead. In the first half, they won by nine points with a score of 23-14 with a light touch. After switching sides, the Chinese team remained unchanged, while the British frequently substituted players, attempting to curb the Chinese team's momentum. However, Wenhua's mid-range shooting, Chengzhang's corner turnaround shots, and Songyuan's layups were unstoppable by the British players. At 36-17, the British team missed a free throw. Songyuan intercepted the ball under the basket and quickly passed it to Wenhua. Wenhua passed it to Shiqiao, who feinted a shot. The British player jumped to block, and Shiqiao cleverly passed it back to Wenhua, who made an open shot. The wonderful coordination earned a full house of applause. The cheering had not yet stopped when the British center scored a layup. Shiqiao returned the favor. The British team launched a full-scale attack, but their shooting was inaccurate and repeatedly missed good opportunities, giving Songyuan the opportunity to shine under the basket. Afterwards, Chengzhang made three out of three shots, and Wenhua and Songyuan also scored. The British team only made two out of two throws, scoring six points. At the end of the game, China won by a landslide with a score of 54-25.</p>

<p>This is the first time the Swedish football team has reached the final week since participating in the World Games. The Swedish team's skillful coordination and lightning-fast attack methods are unmatched by professional football teams in Great Britain, the birthplace of football. Although the Danish team suffered a setback, their front line is also formidable. The Swedish defense is extremely strong. Before this game, they had not conceded a goal in two consecutive matches. However, two minutes into the game, the Danish left winger Spacchi (史巴治) scored a goal. Sweden equalized the score in the 15th minute and then scored three more goals, taking a 4-1 lead in the first half. In the second half, Sweden's attack was still strong, but Danish goalkeeper Nielsen (尼爾遜) performed brilliantly, saving the situation and preventing any further losses. In the 31st minute, Danish left forward Halzen (哈爾遜) powerfully kicked the ball from 20 yards out, hitting the crossbar and going into the net, making the score 2-4. After that, the two Swedish fullbacks returned to defend, and Denmark's strong attack was ineffective, and they were eliminated by Sweden.</p>

<h3>Poems and Praises, Horns Sound Together, A Record of the Opening of the Olympic Games, Great and Warm Opening with Unprecedented Grandeur</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhong Zhen (鐘震)</p>
<p>[Airlifted Dispatch from London, for This Newspaper] July 29th—In the eyes of Londoners, it is indeed an extraordinary day, because since the destruction of the Second World War, London has been greatly damaged and has always been in a state of depression. The World Games, the first global peace event, can be held in London, undoubtedly giving this declining metropolis an opportunity to prosper.</p>
<p>Since the end of June, the weather in Europe has been extremely abnormal, with summer behaving like winter, and continuous cloudy and rainy days, a record not seen since 1919. Therefore, many people worry that it will affect the once-in-a-millennium World Games. However, since the 24th of this month, the low pressure seems to have been driven away by the enthusiastic emotions of the citizens. The mercury column has risen sharply to more than 90 degrees, and the clear sky and hot sun show the original appearance of summer.</p>
<p>Thousands of Heads Moving</p>
<p>The long-awaited 14th Olympic Games finally opened grandly at the Wembley Royal Stadium in southern London, England, this afternoon (July 29) under the auspices of the King of England. Since 12:00 noon, the subway and public buses from the city center to Wembley Park have added shifts, but proportionally, they still cannot catch up with the number of spectators. According to reports, the statistics of tickets sold three days before the opening exceeded 64,000, and the entire stadium can only accommodate a maximum of 82,000 people. After 1:00 PM, the roads from the Wembley Public Underground Station to the stadium were already crowded with people, and the parking lot announced that it was full. Spectators gathered in front of the stadium, the Imperial Swimming Pool, the Engineering Palace, and the BBC Broadcasting Company, waiting to enter the venue. The typical London police officers, riding tall horses, were dispatched to maintain order. The reporter looked down at the crowd from the press office in the community meeting place, like a hundred-section long snake wriggling. Tens of thousands of spectators crowded in the hot sun, and were very excited. The five-ring Olympic flag was flying along the way, and vendors selling program sheets and souvenirs shouted desperately to sell the goods in their hands. Two hours later, the stands around the venue were already full of people. The flags of the participating countries fluttered in the wind around the stands. On a huge scoreboard in the middle of the venue, it was written: "In the Olympic Games, the most important thing is not to achieve victory, but to seek talent, not to be able to defeat others, but to strive for the competition." Facing the royal box—the command platform—on the stands, was a choir of hundreds of people in white clothes, and a royal guard band of more than a hundred people in bright red uniforms, black pants, and black hats. The movie camera was placed at a high place, and more than 80,000 spectators were waiting intently for the opening ceremony to be held.</p>
<p>The Emperor Arrives</p>
<p>At 2:25 PM, a British Cavalry Music Team entered the venue and stood in front of the royal box, blowing a majestic horn sound. Dozens of members of the International Olympic Committee and the entire 14th Olympic Committee, wearing formal clothes, entered in an orderly manner and stood in a line in front of the royal box, quietly waiting for the arrival of the British royal family. At 2:30 PM, with the resounding sound of music, King George VI of England, wearing a sky-blue admiral's uniform, accompanied by the Queen and Princess Margaret, went to the ranks of the committee members, and a cry of "Long live" came from the stands. Immediately, the president of the Olympic Committee introduced all the members to the King of England. Under the guidance of Edstrom (艾德斯托姆), president of the International Olympic Committee, and Sir Burt (卜爾托), president of this conference, he entered the royal box seat. All the spectators stood up and played the British national anthem.</p>
<p>Athletes Parade</p>
<p>After that, the band played marches. In the cadence of the music, 6,000 athletes from 59 countries entered the venue. The Greek team took the lead, followed by a Boy Scout holding a wooden sign with the words of each country written on it, followed by athletes holding the national flag. All the Greek athletes were wearing gray uniforms and white shoes. Because they were the first team, they attracted the attention of the audience. Then, they were arranged in alphabetical order according to the English spelling, so the next were the Afghan athletes wearing dark green uniforms and Turkish hats. The uniforms of the athletes of various countries were the most noticeable. The red shirts and white pants of the Danish athletes, and the white French hats worn by the female athletes, echoed the red bottom and white cross of the Danish flag in front of the team, making them even more colorful and extraordinary. There were more than 50 representatives from our country, wearing blue uniforms, white trousers, white shirts, purple-red ties, and black leather shoes, looking energetic and earning a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Announcing the Opening</p>
<p>The long procession of 6,000 people was completed in one hour and five minutes. The chairman of the conference then gave the opening speech, the content of which was: reporting the process of deciding to hold this conference in London, and hoping that the young people who came from every corner of the world from the 50+ participating countries would build up a spirit of friendship with each other. He also said: The 4th Olympic Games in 1908 were also held here forty years ago. At that time, the host was the father of the country, George V, and now the ceremony is hosted by King George VI, etc. After the speech, the Emperor read the opening remarks in front of the broadcasting machine and celebrated the conference's ability to be held on schedule. The sound of "Long live" rose again. In the sound of music and horns, the colorful five-ring Olympic flag slowly rose. The wicker baskets of the Boy Scouts next to the runway were suddenly opened high. 7,000 pigeons flapped their wings and soared. For a time, the sky was full of white pigeons, and the choir sang the Olympic hymn. Several planes circled in the low air above the venue. A 21-gun salute was fired. At 4:07 PM, the torch arrived. John Mack (約翰馬克), who was only 23 years old, carried the torch, which had been burning for 12 days, and brought it from the ancient Olympic temple in Greece, and rushed in. Under the sunlight, it was extremely beautiful. After circling the venue, he ran to the top of the gate and lit it in the white marble pillar. After that, the leaders of the US delegation and athletes from all countries declared: "We swear that we will faithfully participate in the Olympic competition, abide by all the rules of the conference, value sportsmanship and spirit, and win glory for sports." At this time, the choir's singing began again, and the audience cheered and applauded, with a sound that reached the sky, and the crowds reached a frenzy. Finally, with the march being played, each athlete team retired, and the opening ceremony was completed. In the next fourteen days, a heart-pounding competition will be held in 21 places such as the Haringey Drum Competition Venue, Dulwich, and Chiswick Park in London. 200,000 spectators who came to London are eagerly awaiting the brilliant record.</p>
<h3>Northeast Universities Relocating to Beiping: Ministry Approves Independent Operations; Classes to Commence Separately Upon Confirmation of School Sites; Private School Students Must Await Placement Exams</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] The Ministry of Education issued a clear order on the 9th for all national universities in the Northeast to relocate to Beiping, and approved their independent operations. This outcome has satisfied various parties, bringing higher education in the Northeast back on track. The Ministry’s telegram to those in charge of the universities stated: “The four national universities relocating to Beiping—Dongbei University, Shenyang Medical College, Changbai Normal College, and Changchun Institute of Technology—will remain under the responsibility of their respective leadership. The task of the Provisional University is to assist with school site selection and to register and assist in distributing the students who have already arrived in Beiping for temporary study. If the original universities decide to relocate to Beiping, and have personnel responsible for all matters, they should immediately be transferred to the original universities for independent operation.” Regarding students from unaccredited schools, the Ministry further instructed: "Those who have arrived in Beiping but have not yet obtained student status should be placed in supplementary classes for registration and review. During the supplementary period, the four universities, in conjunction with the supplementary classes, will conduct entrance and placement exams. Students who pass will be assigned to the appropriate grade, and their past academic records and grades from private schools will be given special recognition.” According to this order, Dongbei University and Changbai Normal College, having already assembled their faculty and students, can separate from the Provisional University as soon as school sites are allocated, and formally commence classes by the end of September.</p>
<h3>On Relief Efforts for Students Fleeing Henan and Shandong to Beijing: Ministry of Education Issues Statement; Hopes They Maintain Resolve, Uphold Order; Educational Placement Problem Being Properly Planned and Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The Ministry of Education spokesman issued the following statement on the 11th regarding the relief efforts for students fleeing Henan and Shandong: “Since the communist bandits in Henan and Shandong have expanded their rebellion, the suppression of the insurgency has intensified. Students in the bandit-controlled areas, unwilling to be coerced, have fled south in droves. Their resolve and experiences are truly pitiable. The Ministry began relief efforts and educational guidance as early as when Bianyuan fell to the bandits. However, the academic qualifications and status of the students arriving in Beijing vary. While temporary relief can be provided uniformly, educational placement must be handled based on individual circumstances. Since February, relevant departments within the Ministry have been constantly deliberating on relief and guidance measures, and implementing them promptly. In conjunction with relevant agencies in the capital, temporary relief efforts have been widely conducted without interruption. The Ministry's Guidance Committee work teams are also providing care and accommodation in various locations. It is estimated that over 13,000 students from Henan, Shandong, and central Jiangsu have arrived in Beijing. Among those who arrived earlier and have verified student status, over 3,500 have been registered into Provisional Middle Schools and Summer Camps. Over 9,000 with unclear student status, and those who arrived later, have been accommodated in over 20 elementary and secondary schools in Beijing for relief, and efforts are underway to facilitate their resumption of studies. Most students arriving in Beijing have been able to maintain order, self-respect, and self-discipline. However, a small number of students have made unreasonable demands, gathered crowds to pressure authorities, such as the 200-plus graduating middle school students demanding unconditional placement in national universities on July 8. On August 1, over 200 middle school graduates from before 1947 demanded guaranteed admission to universities. On August 9, over 100 students from the unaccredited private Zhongyuan Institute of Technology demanded exemption from entrance exams for transfer to universities. On August 10, over 1,000 middle school students who recently arrived in Beijing demanded immediate admission to schools and increased food allowances, all of which are noteworthy. They have even blocked traffic and occupied public offices, escalating their actions to an unacceptable level, which is deeply regrettable! The Ministry is mindful of the students' plight and has repeatedly listened to their petitions. Relevant officials have explained the situation repeatedly and patiently. Fortunately, no major incidents have occurred. However, the situation is volatile, and the communist bandits are seizing opportunities to harm young people. A slight misstep could have dire consequences. It is hoped that students arriving in Beijing will maintain their firm resolve, exercise reason, uphold order, and avoid acting rashly or giving up on themselves. Regarding the issue of education, the Ministry has devised appropriate placement methods based on individual circumstances and has convened the heads of the Shandong and Henan education departments, and the principals of middle schools in the Southwest and eastern Henan in Beijing to discuss school restoration."</p>
<h3>Education Ministry Invites Governors of Suiyuan Districts to Beijing to Discuss Educational Issues</h3>
<p>The Ministry has formulated a plan for discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] In order to discuss the many pressing educational issues in the pacification zones, the Ministry of Education has drafted a comprehensive educational plan and has telegraphed the education commissioners of relevant provinces to come to Beijing for a meeting. It is reported that Li Taihua, the education commissioner of Shandong, has already arrived in Beijing, and the education commissioners of Hubei, Rehe, and Henan provinces will also attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Schedules Tuition Fee Discussion Meeting for the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau is scheduled to hold a symposium on the issue of tuition fees for all municipal public and private universities, middle, and elementary schools for the upcoming semester this Saturday (the 14th) at 3:00 PM at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road. Zhu Jingnong, Gu Shusen, municipal councilors, university professors, representatives of public and private middle and elementary school principals and teachers, and chairpersons of parent-teacher associations from various schools will be invited to attend and jointly discuss the method of collecting tuition fees for the next semester and a reasonable amount to enable schools to maintain their expenditures while considering the burden on parents. This will serve as a basis and reference for the municipal government to set a unified standard.</p>

<h3>Nanchang and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Mayor Wu is a good official. He has the courage, the passion, and, most admirably, the gift of eloquence, making him one of the best in the country.</p>
<p>With this unprecedented surge in public utility prices, Mayor Wu naturally had to say a few words.</p>
<p>However, Mayor Wu, in addition to reiterating yesterday (August 9) the old refrain that "the surge in public utility prices is beyond the control of the municipal government," cited a rather unusual example. He stated that, to his knowledge, "public utility prices in Nanchang are 500 million times higher than in Shanghai, yet the people do not complain."</p>
<p>Why do the citizens of Nanchang possess the manners of the Gentleman's Country in the novel "Flowers in the Mirror," able to understand and embrace difficulties so deeply? According to Mayor Wu's explanation, "Because the Nanchang public utility company was forced to shut down electricity and water due to financial difficulties, causing immense hardship to the people, they were left with no choice but to pay exorbitant prices to have the services continue."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's intention in citing this example is clear: (1) Public utility prices in Shanghai are still cheap, so don't make a fuss; (2) Public utility prices are non-negotiable. If you want water and electricity, you'll just have to bite the bullet and "bear" it, or else be prepared for an abrupt shutdown of services. Why wait until you are in "immense hardship" before "reluctantly paying exorbitant prices to have the services continue," ending up "being forced to eat a fine when you refuse a treat?"</p>
<p>The example cited by Mayor Wu is, of course, factual. Crows of the world are all black. Under the management of incompetent officials, it is also factual that public utility companies readily threaten the people with water and electricity shutdowns to force them to pay exorbitant prices. The people, unable to obtain support from the local government and with water and electricity being essential for life, have no choice but to endure and submit under these circumstances. This is also, of course, factual.</p>
<p>In Mayor Wu's words, only the phrases "the people do not complain" and the subsequent "reluctantly" seem somewhat contradictory—perhaps a kind of "reluctant" "without complaint"—but it sounds a bit odd. However, this is a minor detail and need not be dwelt upon.</p>
<p>However, when Mayor Wu made the above statement, I wonder if he had seen that day's (August 9) edition of this newspaper. On page 2 of that day's paper, there was a filler news item, a brief special dispatch from Fanyang dated the 7th, stating: "Changchun Mayor Shang Chuandao telegraphed here, saying that the price of sorghum rice in Changchun has reached 10 million legal tender per catty. Citizens are buying rice by the ounce. This is unprecedented. 500 million yuan banknotes are circulating in the market."</p>
<p>If, in a few days, the price of rice in Shanghai fluctuates again, I wonder if Mayor Wu will also compare it and say, "The price of rice in Changchun is ×× times higher than in Shanghai, yet the people can still survive buying rice by the ounce"?</p>
<p>If you say that Changchun is Changchun, and Shanghai is Shanghai, and they cannot be compared, then is Nanchang Shanghai?</p>
<p>I still clearly remember Mayor Wu's inaugural speech at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. He said that to stabilize prices, he was determined to crack down on unscrupulous merchants, "even if it means offending many people." He also urged workers to be open and cooperative with employers, and not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. However, since public utility expenses are closely related to the cost of living index, how can industry and commerce avoid becoming the "goose to be killed" sooner or later when this price increase stimulates the index, and the index then stimulates prices? Mayor Wu should really summon the courage to "offend people" and save these sickly, emaciated geese gasping for breath.</p>
<p>The example of Nanchang is frightening; however, what is frightening is not so much the profit-seeking Nanchang public utility company, but the Nanchang local authorities who disregard the people's survival—so incompetent, so cowardly, so callous!</p>

<p>Born by the sea, iron city, Ziwen, Yuyu, and other gentlemen,</p>
<p>How can we trace the beginnings? Supporting the edifice once exhausted many hearts. Forever remembering the difficult times, who shares them now? I pity the decline that approaches day by day. My spirit grieves for sparrows attached to the hall, my dream is cold of chickens in the 洠林. Who believes that when the rooster crows in wind and rain, the auspicious air of the Five Tombs becomes desolate day by day?</p>
<h3>Fear</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>Worry creates fear, and fear creates misfortune. Walking on a narrow wooden plank suspended in the air, the more fearful you are, the easier it is to fall; the less fearful you are, the safer you can cross. Such is life. Such is practical politics.</p>
<p>To put it in a nutshell: the authorities' "announcement of the birth of 5 million dollar notes" is a sign of fear; saying that the large notes affect prices is a "psychological illusion" of the people is also a sign of fear. As Shaw said: "A mousetrap can catch mice. But it is a bit hard to imagine a mousetrap chasing mice!" The relationship between large notes and prices is not more complex than cross-country running. Therefore, it is best if large notes are issued secretly, but this could not be done, so even "larger" notes were announced in advance to reduce "stimulation." This "stimulation" is no longer a stimulation of prices, but a stimulation of people's senses. Because in reality, when "large" notes are officially issued, prices will still catch up.</p>
<p>Therefore, the authorities are issuing large notes in a state of anxious glances. Someone who is extremely afraid "thinks" of learning to swim in winter and ice skating in summer, but cannot get his wish, which is quite pitiful. The origin of fear, to put it more primitively, is the animal's use of it to protect its life in danger. The adrenal glands increase secretion, the heart beats rapidly, blood flow is frequent, and muscles twitch. Many animals attack in this state. Often, to protect a part of the danger, the whole is neglected. Old eagles often use the attack-like terror of small streams to capture it. Snakes are also like this.</p>
<p>Fear is not typhoid, but it is contagious. Walt Disney often tells us in his cartoons stories like this: One deer is afraid and runs away first, and the herd of deer follows. If the leader falls into a valley and dies, the herd of deer will also fall into the valley and die. If a house catches fire, the elder runs away, and the whole family runs away. Social psychologists say that obedience to orders is based on fear. If the issuance of orders is also based on fear, then it is very sad. It only makes the concept of fear expand day by day, thus creating the panic of today.</p>
<p>It is said that ideal politics is based on "love." This "love," in the current situation, may have to refer to Romantic Love! That is, the object of love must be regarded as very difficult to possess and very precious, so one must do everything possible to win the love of this object. Whether using poems or songs, or even a Spanish Guitar, is perfectly fine, as long as you are sincere and confident when you strum the strings. But if you tremble to ask for love, you can forget about winning the hearts of girls.</p>
<p>I am not an economist. But I believe that no economist can completely transform the current economic situation, just as a surgeon cannot reconstruct the organization of a person's life. But if the authorities can take stable strides with confidence, perhaps it will be beneficial to the stability of the entire economy.</p>
<p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa began to tilt in the eighteenth century. If everyone was afraid of its collapse, perhaps it would have been rebuilt long ago. The influence of psychology on the "human body" is often so amazing.</p>
<h3>Eastern Scales and Western Claws</h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>In 1947, the United States produced as many as 3.51 trillion cigarettes, of which 300 billion were exported. Domestic consumption averaged 2,293 cigarettes per person per year, or two packs of 20 cigarettes per person per week, including grandmothers and newborns.</p>
<p>There is a new invention in the textile industry called "Malon," a man-made resin that can be applied to cotton cloth to give it a silk sheen that will not fade or wear off. Bed sheets treated in this way can last twice as long.</p>
<p>This year, a safety device has been installed on highways throughout the United States. This device includes two large square mirrors supported by iron frames and placed on both sides of highways at uphill, downhill, sharp turns, or railroad crossings.</p>
<p>The UK is still excavating bombs that sank underground during the war and have not yet exploded. Some of these bombs are more than sixty feet deep, while others are skewed as far as thirty feet away.</p>
<p>The globally popular Parker 51 pen requires 238 manufacturing and assembly procedures. Each pen takes a total of 33 minutes to manufacture, including 26 minutes for parts manufacturing and 7 minutes for final assembly.</p>
<p>Every time Stalin travels by train, the chauffeur of the special train is always a woman named Xenette Dalai-Zroya. Stalin trusts her more than any male driver.</p>
<h3>Talking about Choice</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>Heaven endows people with the ability to choose. If they can use it well, they will be blessed on all sides and benefit immensely. Confucius advocated "do not befriend those who are not as good as yourself," while the contemporary American writer John Dos Passos (according to recent news, this gentleman was in a car accident some time ago, his wife died, and he himself lost an eye) wrote about a courtesan who, when she first went to Hollywood, always hung out with extras and minor characters, thinking that it was meaningless. An American celebrity also said that if you want to get rich, you must hang out with rich people. Although this is an extreme statement based on the vicissitudes of the world, it can be seen that if an individual wants to achieve success, he must be careful in choosing friends.</p>
<p>In fact, in our daily lives, if we can spend more time choosing, we will surely reap more rewards. When purchasing any supplies, if we can carefully choose in advance, the coffee we buy will not be moldy, the sleeves of the shirt will not be too large, and there will be no small holes in the fabric that have been repaired. Even when taking a rickshaw, if you can choose a young and strong rickshaw puller, pulling a rickshaw with a snow-white cushion, clean armrests, and a blanket to pad your feet, he will not only run like the wind, but your white shirt or blouse worn in summer, when placed on the rickshaw bar, will also be free from dust or rust.</p>
<p>The essence of Darwin's theory of evolution is that things compete and nature selects, and the fittest survive. The so-called natural selection is, after all, a very abstract thing. In reality, it is the individuals in the same society who are choosing. If the selection is stricter, there will be more elimination, and the progress of society will be faster, although from an emotional point of view, it is inevitably a little cruel for those who are outdated to be exhausted and fail.</p>
<h3>The Art Black Market in Paris</h3>
<p>— Ru Shi</p>
<p>Europe is currently experiencing a new "art renaissance." The prices of works of art are soaring day by day—but the people who collect these works of art are no longer the wealthy gentlemen of the past. Today, the customers who buy paintings are indeed paying unprecedentedly high prices, spending a fortune without hesitation; but the source of their money is hoarding, black market operations, or large-scale smuggling.</p>
<p>They are not just being cultured; they just want to buy low and sell high, and make another profitable business from these works of art. Works of art themselves have also created a black market. Cities such as Marseille and Naples are distribution centers for black market works of art. However, the most important activity center is of course Paris.</p>
<p>There are indeed many people in Paris who have made a fortune from "national disaster" and "victory." The source of their assets is mostly inscrutable, but in order to facilitate private transactions, most of the banknotes they hold are large notes with a face value of 5,000 francs. Recently, in order to crack down on these profiteers, the National Bank of France suddenly announced that all people holding large notes with a face value of 5,000 francs must exchange them for small notes at the bank within 72 hours. After this time, these large notes would be invalid. This, of course, shocked those nouveau riche profiteers, but they thought of a clever plan: buy paintings.</p>
<p>They bought many famous paintings at extremely high prices, paying entirely with large notes with a face value of 5,000 francs. It is naturally no problem for the people who sold the paintings to take these large notes to exchange for small notes. Their large notes came from legitimate transactions, and those nouveau riche profiteers had already happily cleared out these large notes. The people who sold the paintings were certainly not fools, and they took this opportunity to reap a huge profit. One person sold a batch of paintings within 24 hours of the deadline, receiving large notes worth a total of 10 million francs, and the amount he earned purely from this 10 million francs was more than 7 million francs.</p>
<p>One person, who was a tailor before the war, met a customer who specialized in collecting famous paintings, who owed him money. That customer sent him a few paintings as compensation. Unexpectedly, this tailor was very good at doing business, and he started from these few paintings, and things went smoothly. Now he has built a first-class gallery in Paris.</p>
<p>When the German army occupied France, many French painters fled to the Vichy region, which was not occupied by the German army. At that time, foreign exchange was cut off, and there was simply no way out for their works. In order to eat and clothe themselves, they had to sell these works cheaply. At that time, several far-sighted art dealers took the opportunity to buy them in large quantities, and today they have become extremely popular dealers in the Paris art market.</p>
<p>The people who are active in the "art black market" in Paris are not necessarily all ruthless guys who only know how to make money. One person who used to work in a bank said, "Look at the situation in Europe, no one knows what will happen in the end. If a war breaks out, what if the franc is worthless? Of course, you should buy more things with real value. Buying paintings is best. If there is any sign of trouble, you can just take out the painting frame, roll it up, and run away."</p>
<p>In this kind of transaction, American soldiers are also not lagging behind. An American soldier stationed in Berlin exchanged three cartons of cigarettes for a good painting. When he got to Paris, he sold it for 300,000 francs, but he didn't know that the painting had risen to 700,000 francs in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The most popular items in the "art black market" are the works of new painters. The most fashionable painters are Modigliani, Picasso, Matisse, Utrillo, and Braque. However, these painters are now not very enthusiastic about painting. Although Picasso has painted a lot, he rarely sells them. He knows the principle that scarcity makes things valuable. At this time of soaring prices, he really does not want to produce too much, so as not to cause a price drop.</p>
