<h3>海關進口稅及貨物稅立法院修正通過　鹽稅不增加麥粉稅免徵</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕立法院廿日全日舉行第三次秘密會議，孫科主席，出席委員四百餘人。上午先討論財金委會報吿審査修正海關進口稅則草案案，結果照審査意見修正通過。繼討論財金委會曾同海事委會報告審查行政院咨請審議鹽稅稅率條例草案案，該草案原訂依照戰前幣値，每担食鹽徵稅四元，依躉發物價指數昇算，審查意見，決議保留。乃二十日會中，陳克文，鄒樹文等，復倡通過原案，以每人極輕之負担，充裕國庫收入，當遭陳明仙，岳樹猷，許蟠雲，謝澄宇等强烈反對，以爲增加鹽稅，普遍加重一般人民負祖，無異徵收人頭稅。國家增闢財源，應　使富人多出錢着手。辯論終結後，付諸表決，贊成政院咨提原案者僅九十四人（在塲委員三一四人），審査意見　得成立，鹽稅仍依現行稅率征課，不予修改，至午十二時半散會。下午三時許，繼續開會，仍由孫院長主席，討論財金委會之報吿審査修正貨物稅條例第三條，第四條，第五條，曁國產菸酒類稅條例第四條條文案，結果照審査意見修正通過。原列之麥粉稅，予以取消，不再徵稅。繼處理政院提請審議之戡亂建國動員委會預算案，及國大代表要求公費歲費案，至晚六時半散會。</p>

<h3>經濟管制機構的存廢</h3>
<p>經濟管制機構，名目繁多，極一時之盛。其中有屬於全國性的，也有局於一隅的，有係永久性質的，也有臨時設立的，而名稱與人事之變更，組織與範圍之推移，尤爲日新月異，目不暇接。推其結果，究竟於國於民，有多大益處，於當前的經濟情形，更有多大補救，事實擺在面前，似乎用不着多所推論。試拿金融管理局來說吧，滬。漢。穗等處，原來主持其事的人，也多紛紛　冠，掉首不顧，其原因何在，値得深思。</p>
<p>戰亂時期，軍事與經濟並重，題目太大，有許多抱着懷疑態度的人，也不得不故持鄭重，靜待推移。然而勝利以還，經濟情勢，江河日下，大有愈管愈壞之象，與抗戰時期「愈平愈貴」的佳話，幾可後先輝映。而一部份的不肖官吏，假借公務上之便利，營私瀆職，肆意敲詐，更予人以不良的印像，其尤爲可異的，乃是本非主管而也夾凑熟鬧，自命爲經濟管制的機構，紛紛行使其職權，於是所謂管制機構更覺紛紜複雜，不可究詰，而撤消這類管制機構的呼聲和提議，也終於在立法院中怒吼而出了。</p>
<p>平心而論，在這非常時期，放任主義是否可以完全採用，確還値得硏究。尤其是外匯政策，與對外貿易政策，大多數的意見，總以爲實施管理，在目前還是必要的。不過經濟管制，不論對內對外，無非為截長補短，求取最高的效益，其手段或類似消極，而其用意却總是積極的。就管制的意義言，對於某都份或某時期的經濟行爲，或不得不出於相當的限制，而就整個的事業看來，到底重在扶助，推進，與有計劃地加以發展，而不是一味故予箝制，壓抑，存心與工商企業爲敵，而卒使國與民交受其弊。所以管制經濟，亦稱計劃經濟，顯與盲目的或惡意的摧殘工商企業不同，更與那些　端漁利，另有作用的搜括自肥手段大有差別！</p>
<p>基於上述理由，這一類管制機構之應否裁撤，其要點在於過去與現存的事實是否可以證明其於國家有益；就是說，這些機關，對於經濟方面，究竟是在盲目地成　意　加以摧殘呢？抑或在有計劃地加以推進？假如說是在有計劃地加以推進，其言行是否相符？有沒有成績可以拿出來與人共賞？有沒有人尤其是一部分執行的人，從中利用，只實現了他們的副作用？</p>
<p>單從表面上看，任何機構，皆有其可以存在的理由；單從書面上看，任何機構，亦皆有其門面話可資粉飾。然而門面話畢竟是門面話，實際上牠們已把國家經濟，搞得如此地一團轉了！不看見外匯的管制嗎？自備外匯，不問其所準備用以輸入的是機器或必需品還是奢侈品，却統通盲目地關在國外；華僑資金，更因匯率的不切實際，一齊　向香港去了。管貿易吧，出口推不動，外洋原料又以外匯缺乏而無法進口，却反坐視許多國產走私出去，大批純消耗品和奢侈品走私進來。管紗布吧，儘管喊着代紡代識，統購統銷的口號，而廠家怵於原料不繼，紛紛準備减工，一部份定好的機器和錠子，已迫於情勢而變更在香港卸貨，就在香港平添了二十萬錠子的紗廠。管物價，管通貨吧，遊資越管越多，利息越管越大，物價和工資也越管越高了。管動力，管燃料吧，公用事業，一月數漲，煤斤黑市日形猖獗，而產區存煤山積，却又扼於管制，無法自動運銷，更談不到調劑與疏導。諸如此類，不勝枚舉，自前年以來，行政院三易其人，而管制效果，愈趨愈下。我們實在不知道他們的管制效力究竟安在？我們更不忍說：他們在高唱管制的漂亮口號掩護之下，究竟要把國家經濟國民生活，搞到甚麼地步，方算功德圓滿！</p>
<p>最奇怪的是：每逢確定了一個管制的對象，就照例要另設一個管制的機構，而且在各地方必須要中央部　自己派員來設立，尤其在上海是更顯然爲他們的注目點。我們不知道國家設官，究竟要那些一地方政府何用？但撇開了地方政府，我們也不知道他們這些中央機關是否眞能單獨執行其任務？如衆所周知，凡屬經濟管制，必須是全國性，即是要全面施行的。倘甲地管制，乙地不管，彼此不相聯緊，彼此牴觸矛盾；必至弊病百出，造成了許多紛亂！最近上海一市嚴査倉庫，好似雷厲風行，便有許多食米，紛紛運往無錫，即是一個顯著的例子。但是中央機構，縱使儘量推廣，又何能在各地普徧設立？不能警　設立，又何從推行全國，達到全面施行的目的？再拿管制金融來做個例吧，各地銀樓皆照常營業，獨上海一市居然尙在盲目管制之中，硬是不許營業。又買賣金鈔，據說是犯法的，但厦門·廣州等埠公開營業，不知那邊有沒有金管局？內地許多省分，公然行使銀元，銅幣，鄕村地方，更拿食米來作工資，房租，和物價標準的，尤其普　，似此公開違反國家貨幣條例，金管局因何不管？財政部有沒有知道？明知之而故縱之，眞所謂眼開眼閉，那又何必　在上海起勁，而硬派上海一埠有萬　奸商，罪在不赦？</p>
<p>總而言之，要管制經濟，必須先要樹立明確的政策，必須實行統盤籌劃，酌孜劑　，以求全盤的推進，這管制機有意義。萬不可忽作忽輟，隨興所之，亦不宜掛一漏百，聯資點綴。尤其不可一面要想抑平物價，一面却又提高拆息，政策矛盾，無以自圓其說。凡一切人事上與挹注性質的作用，更須汰除凈盡，不夾雜任何私意，然後可以談計劃，談發展。至於執行機構，自應備先利用地方政府，非必不得已，不宜巧立名目，多設冗員，致加　國庫之負担。尤其是執行管制的人員，非有純潔品性，萬不宜侈談管制！立法院裁撤這一類機構的提議，通過與否尙未可知，奉勸主管部曾倒不必因此着慌。而且現行管制，如果眞是値得網續辦理下去的話，也不一定以一律維持原有腐敗無能的機構爲必要條件的！</p>
<h3>開發海南島計劃　粵九區專署已擬具完竣　榆林將建為現代化軍港</h3>
<p>〔本報海口二十日電〕據悉：開發瓊島富源，勢在必行。政府要員及美籍專家曾先後來瓊，作初步調査，除將重要資料整理研究外，並命九區專署就地詳査各種特產資斜，並擬具開發計劃。現此項計劃書已編印完竣，呈美援專家參考，內容包括鐵礦·水利·漁·鑒·糖·農各業，如按照實施成功，即整個廣東經建問題亦將獲益不鮮。據此間某要員表示·瓊島建設資金，可能佔全部美援建設專款之五分一，島南楡林建爲現代化軍港計劃，聞亦將同時實行。該港除可泊萬噸　幢大艦外，其週邊復爲鐵礦·漁·鹽·蘊藏極豐地帶，其所在地之縣份，崖縣恒被譽爲天南寳庫，除建有機塲外，並爲瓊島唯一有鐵路之地方，惜本國力量尙未能迅速達成，此項偉大而艱巨萬分之計劃，端賴美國促成，近傳旅港瓊商發表宣言，抗議美國使用海南島事，當係指此而言。據有地位之人士聲稱，瓊島急需開發，該項抗議實不足代表民意云。</p>

<p>加强執行必有成效</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕地政部政次湯惠蓀赴華北視察，並分訪　主任，傅總司令，交換土地改革意見，頃對記者談：此次赴華北視察，所到各地，對土地改革均熱忱推行，山西實行兵農合一，其目標爲「耕者有田種」，所有耕地均由政府劃爲「份地」，分配與國民兵耕種，地主仍保持所有權，政府則控制分配權，而使耕農取得使用權。此種政策在山西確已澈底實行，頗著成效，値得各省仿效。華北剿總轄區，對於土地改革之實施，傳總司令已草擬辦法，大體仍依照中央所頒綏靖區土地處理辦法之規定，其更進一步者，爲征收地價捐，視被征土地面積之多少，按其應受補償地價累進征捐。該項實施辦法，本人已與傳總司令詳加研討，希望最近即能施行。至河北第十區王專員鳳崗所採辦法，主要在保護佃農，加重地主負担，使其放棄土地。根據在華北各地觀察，實施土地改革確有迫切需要，地方當局倘認眞負責加强執行，成效必有可觀，</p>

<h3>社會黨反對增國防經費　法國許曼內閣垮臺　總統召各黨領袖洽商組閣</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二十日電〕國民議會以二九七對二一四票通過社會黨所提削减國防預算一百二十億法郞之修正案，而對許曼內閣投不信任票後，許曼內閣乃於昨午夜辭職。歐禮和總統已開始與各黨領袖商談，以覓取新總理。歐禮和根據成例，首先接見議會最大政黨共黨領袖陶萊土及共黨議員組領袖杜格洛，各方認此一洽談，乃組閣前之一種手續，並不予以重視，相信共黨當不致受命組閣，甚至重入內閣。歐禮和總統對於社會黨之於國際緊張局勢之下，迫使政府垮台，深爲不滿。當國防預算案由國民議會表決之前，社會黨閣員七人拒絕就削减國防預算費修正案讓步，已先向許曼總理提出辭呈。一般相信新閣之組織必甚困難，在新聞中勢必仍容納社會黨員，但組織中間偏右內閣而不容納社會黨之內閣，亦並非絕對不可能。可能出任總理者爲急進黨閣員馬利。人民共和黨外畏皮杜爾·及社會黨之內長莫林·國民議會副議長勒特洛蓋。前總理賴瑪迪等。歐禮和在星期三以前當不致覓得適得的總理人選命其組閣，而新總理在組閣前，亦必須獲得國民議會之信任票，故新閣之成立當在一週之後，在成立以前許曼內閣當暫時繼續供職。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二十日電〕法國之內閣危機，因歐禮和總統之不獲覓取適當的總理人選而陷入僵局。歐氏今晨接見各黨領袖後，承認距可望覓得適當總理人選之期尙遠。觀察家預料在今後廿四小時內，歐禮和總統如仍不獲組閣之人，則恐不得不使用舉行普選之機構。僵局形成之主要原因，在於國會主要各黨實力大致相當，未有一黨願作適當讓步，俾得合作以組織新的中間路綫政府。同時戴高樂將軍又發表演說，指出過去政府之治國不當，不容再讓無能的政府秉政。渠又曰法蘭西人民團結運動願獲秉政之欋，當必須由人民授予此等權力。戴氏之意即爲要求舉行普選，使其人民團結運動有勝利之機會。若干人士相信戴高樂之出現，或可反而迫使社會黨及急進黨同意讓步，組織新聯合內閣以避免普選之舉行。</p>
<h3>西歐五國外長決定　對蘇採延宕政策　皮杜爾提前自海牙歸國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社海牙二十日電〕西歐聯盟五國外長會議今日認爲德國局勢極端嚴重，決對蘇聯採取延宕政策。</p>
<p>〔合衆社海牙二十日電〕法國許曼政府之垮台，不帝爲西歐聯盟會議當頭棒喝。法外長皮杜爾定今晚回國，其他外長咸同意取消午後之最後正式會議。英法比荷盧五國外長今晨屛却顧問密商法政潮所引起之問題，。法國危機影響此問所討論主要問題之根基，即西歐之防衛問題，然西歐一主要國家竟因議會反對增加國防軍備，政府宣吿下口。</p>
<p>據報，美國曾警吿西歐五國稱，美國軍事援助計劃之成立，恐尙須數年之久。西歐會議二十日晚閉幕公報中恐僅對德國問題及美國軍援兩重要議題，有輕描淡寫之提起。關於柏林問題，英外相貝文聽取其他四外長反對與蘇聯攤牌之呼籲，皮杜爾及荷比盧三國尤其反對以武力打開對鎖之大膽嘗試，彼等力言應以全力恢復四强談判。</p>
<p>〔路透社海牙二十日電〕西歐聯盟五國外長二十日繼續在荷蘭外交節內舉行西歐聯盟諮詢委員會之第二日，亦即最後一日之會議，貝文外相事先並與皮杜爾外長舉行三小時之個別會談，殆曾檢討一般國際局勢。據咨詢委會會議之發言人稱，本屆會議結束後，即將發表公報。此次會議開始以來雖嚴守秘密，但接近五國代表團之人士則謂，會塲空氣殊爲融洽。關於德國問題之討論獲有良好進展，可望就所應採取之下一行動獲得協議。若干觀察家並預料新的照會，不久可向莫斯科提出。荷蘭政府昨夜曾在荷蘭國會之特里凡薩爾廳，宴請五國代表團。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社海牙二十日電〕此間五國外長會議不顧法閣倒潰，今晨仍繼續硏究各項政治問題。經濟及社會問題將交付特委會硏究，由委員會草成議案，送交隨議之全體大會通過。皮社爾擬於今日根據聯邦之理想草成一項歐洲協約方案，該方案將包括下列兩點：（一）設立一委員會研究白魯塞爾公約國之關稅同盟問題；（二）成立一由各國之國會組成之歐洲國會。</p>
<h3>史達林派遣醫師　探望陶格里亞蒂</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬十九日電〕據悉史達林已派遣蘇聯醫師兩名，來此探望陶格里亞蒂之傷勢，義共對史達林之關切甚表重視。刺陶氏兇手之審訊已宣佈延期，蓋陶氏本人目前不能出庭作證。</p>
<h3>英議員建議　促開五強會議　政府表示拒絕</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十九日電〕英政府今日在下院拒絕一項建議，即設法與中蘇美法舉行五强會議，以處理緊急國際局勢與保障和平之建議。工黨議員華倍要求英國「站於代表聯合國機構聯合行動之立塲，爲維持國際和平與安全」，而提議召開五强會議。華氏稱，此舉符合聯合國憲章第一〇六款。該條款規定如列强不能依據憲章第四十三款建立國際警衛軍，五强得進行諮商，外次梅修答稱，「否，先生。」繼稱，「吾人現無表示吾人對和平願望之必要，吾人亦未忘懷憲章第一〇六條，但如吾人在第四十三條憲章不能獲致合作，則引用第一〇六條亦　多餘之舉。」</p>
<h3>蘇牛式戰鬥機作威脅性表演　英佔領軍當局提抗掋</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林二十日電〕蘇聯雅克戰鬥機一架，昨在柏林英區蓋多機塲上空低空飛行，英方以此舉有遠航空規則，已於今日正式向蘇抗議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十九日電〕蘇聯「犂牛」式戰鬥機一隊，今日自蘇佔區飛機此間，並在蓋多機塲上作花巧表演。據英軍當局稱，蘇司令部事前曾以蘇機飛來柏林通知四國航空管制站，但並宋干涉西方各國空運工作。關於蘇機在英軍基地上空之行動，現有兩種報吿。據美軍當局稱，該隊蘇機共計士二架，其中兩架　掠而下，旋即　速上升，從「腹下穿過」飛往該處之美軍C54型運輪機。按蘇英機塲相距僅約六哩。英方則謂，蘇機八架至十架在蓋多機塲上空「打圈」先是，另一架單獨飛至美軍運輸機身旁，但未作個想攻擊之狀。</p>
<h3>蘇聯發動雙重攻勢　願供應柏林食糧　英美揭穿此舉用意決置不理</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林二十日電〕蘇聯今日宣布將以糧食供給柏林各區居民一舉，乃對西方各國之雙重攻勢，因其不但自稱能够供給柏林全部糧食，且擬使西方各國發行之新馬克成爲廢紙，無法用於購糧。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二十日電〕蘇聯於今日採用使西方盟國處於窘態，以迫英退出柏材的新措施。索柯一洛夫斯基總部頃正式宣布，將立即撥出向捷克及波蘭訂購之糧食燃料十萬噸，供給柏林全市各區，各區居民祗須以東德馬克付價，均可購取此等配給物品。</p>
<p>政界人士謂蘇聯此舉，係因對柏林居民恫嚇無效以後，改以糧食燃料爲餌，誘使柏林人民接受蘇聯之政策。西方盟國今已面臨一項難題，被等對於蘇方援助柏林人民此一善舉，勢難加以拒絕，但若予以接受，即不啻默認柏林乃蘇聯區之一部，不復爲四强共同之責任。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二十日電〕英官方發表聲明，指蘇聯當局之願以糧食燃料供給柏林全市，爲純粹的宣傳作用，英美　其將置之不理，而將繼續設法以物品接濟柏林西區。聲明並曰，柏林西區並不缺糧，空運開始後，運來之糧食已足敷應用，如蘇方不切斷柏林之交通，則西區糧食供應並不困難。</p>
<h3>英美法軍事長官　與西德總理會談</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十九日電〕美軍政府長官克萊，英軍政府長官羅勃森，及法軍政府長官寇尼汗，今日在柏林英軍總部開會四小時，討論西德十一邦總理對倫敦會議關於西德憲政之雞議，提出反建議後西德之一般局勢。事後據克萊宣布，柏林危機在會中絕未談及。三長官定二十日在佛朗克福與西德十一邦總理會談。</p>
<h3>捷整粛陸軍　三高級將領逃德</h3>
<p>〔合衆社佛朗克福十九日電〕消息靈通之觀察家十九日預料，最近逃至德境之三名捷克高級將領，將透露蘇聯在歐戰略之重要部門，一般僉信此三人並　有關於蘇聯之情報，包括捷克在內。此三人爲第二次大戰中在西綫捷軍總司令李斯加上將，曾任國防部長范聶克上將，及副參謀總長赫賽爾上將。據隨同此三將軍來德之軍官員稱，捷克自接獲莫斯科之加速「蘇維埃化」命令後，捷克陸軍中正在進行肅淸。此外（一）捷陸總參謀長鮑科克已被免職並遭監視。（二）薩伐波達已成有名無實之人物。（三）　伐波達之職位由莫斯科訓練之史朗斯基（捷共書記長）繼任。（四）爲肅淸「不可　」之軍官，業已使軍官集團拆散，在嚴重之區域內並出動憲兵，各村鎭中已在組織共黨民團。（五）十二個旅之警察已在　境戒備，尙有四萬五千名軍隊已調往担任邊防。</p>
<h3>美名將潘興長眼亞林頓　葬儀隆重肅穆</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕此間亞林　公基今日舉行潘興元帥國葬典禮，杜魯門總統親率陸海空軍各級將領士兵到塲致敬，儀式嚴肅隆重，第一次世界大戰美軍統帥　茲長眼地下。墓地濃蔭掩覆，佳城環繞，由其　昔統帶之菲律賓與歐洲諸役部屬永伴左右。陸軍牧師米勒致誄詞稱，「又一軍人之行程結束，潘氏生前戰無不勝，今則瞑目安息，等待號曾。」靈柩在大雨中由灰色馬六匹拖曳自國會至公幕時，市民五十萬夾道爭覩，執紼行列長達一哩。</p>
<h3>南韓國民義會舉行選舉　李承晚當選總統　李始榮被選為副總統</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城廿日電〕南韓國民會議今日最舉行第卅三次會議，選舉目任總統，出席議員共一百九十七人，缺席者僅一人，外賓席及旁聽席上人滿爲息。李承晚氏仍居議長席，宣佈開會後，曾請聯合國朝鮮臨時委員會代表報吿其工作狀況。十一時開始投票，李承晚計得一百八十票，以絕對多數</p>
<p>其餘金九得十三票，安在鴻得二票，廢票一張乃投徐載弼博士者，因徐係美國國籍，故認爲廢票。下午繼續開會，選舉副總統，計第一次投票李始榮得一百一十三票，金九得六十五票，趙晚植十一票，因李始榮所得票數未超過三分之二，再舉行第二次投票，在第二次投票中，李得一百卅三票，當選爲副總統。李承晚氏於當選後即對記者發表談話稱：「關於組織內閣事，須與副總統商議後決定之。將首先決定國務總理，然後由國務總理選任國務員」。</p>
<h3>美軍在北韓邊界</h3>
<p>美軍五人中死傷各一人</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿日電〕美軍五人十九日在開桑城附近之美蘇佔領區分界綫南約四百碼之地，遭一隊韓人埋伏偸襲，死傷各一人。佔領軍總部稱：該隊韓人係在美境，偸襲後即撒入蘇方佔領區，可能即係自北韓巡入美國佔領區之暴動集團之一。此次美軍之被襲事件，在佔領後尙屬首次，雖然過去在分界處有若干韓人被擊殺。某高級美國當局稱，措詞非常嚴厲之抗議書，將向平壤之蘇佔領軍當局提出，雖然，過去屢次關於邊界事件之抗議，蘇方迄未作覆。</p>
<h3>日前進步黨領袖　犬養健整肅取消</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京二十日電〕據某權威人十吿中央社記者稱，日本進步黨前領袖犬養健，前會一度被整肅，現將宣吿無罪。犬養健之復位正式聲明，可望於今日發表。犬養健之重返政壇，對日本政治將有甚好之影響。一般人士皆認爲犬養健爲日本眞正自由政治家之一。</p>
<h3>港政府頒布財政新措施　防止英鎊逃避</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港二十日電〕香港政府財長頃通知各核准銀行，自即日起香港與英國間之匯劃，在英金五百鎊等値以上者，必須得香港匯兌管制局之許可。各銀行如査得款項來源，確係可靠的進口及出口·保險費債款·合理旅行費用·紅利及利息等項款項，可予代辦，毌庸呈請政府當局審核。此等限制辦法，在防止利用香港之自由美元市塲賤價套購英鎊，或使英鎊資金逃往美國。</p>

<h3>日共領袖德田被刺　九州島宣布總罷工　日共衆議員向政府提抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿日電〕日共領袖野阪及細川衆議員廿日訪內閣書記長苫米地，爲謀刺德田事件，正式對政府提出抗議，力稱：此項行動，表示日本國內之　武反動份子，依然存在。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿日電〕日共黨領袖野阪參二（岡野進）今日吿法國新開社稱：在昨日投擲炸彈圖刺共黨領袖德田以後，九州島之各地方工會，業已宣佈總罷工。東京大阪區之大工廠，亦已舉行抗議之集會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿日電〕日本及盟總當局苛政　日正採取各種戒備，防止因日共領袖德田之被刺，引起如義大利發生之全國騷動情形。但消息靈通方面則預測一般之騷動及反響必將發生，日本共產黨已狂呼「蘆田內閣辭職」。正在本州南部作旅行演講之蘆田首相，則僅對報界稱：『當左右極端派存在時，日本之復興「極度困難」」，以簡接答覆日共之指斥。渠顯然將支持其保守政府。日共之文吿中稱：「站在勞工大衆的立塲上，吾人宣佈對一切反動之地下組織，展開堅決之鬥爭」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社佐賀廿日電〕謀刺日共領袖德田之廿七歲礦工古賀在警局稱：「余未能刺死德田，殊感遺憾」。渠並稱：「並無人命令余執行此項任務，余實自動爲之，蓋余深信共黨阻礙日本之眞民主化，此亦余所以加入反共大同盟之理由」。</p>
<h3>傳蘇坦克戰術專家　魯柯索夫斯基抵德　索帥索夫斯基抵德</h3>

<h3>美南間關係微妙　兩國簽訂協定解決財政懸案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕南斯拉夫今日和陸空氣中，與美國解決長期懸案一件，此乃狄托與共產國際情報局分裂之結果。南斯拉夫財次自該國京城趕來，與馬歇爾簽訂協定，規定南斯拉夫於四十五日內賠償美戰時與戰後之損失一千七百萬元，包括兩年前在南國境內被擊落之兩架美機之損失在內。美國方面則允將一九四二年以來扣留之南斯拉夫在美存金解凍，南斯拉夫私人產業一千萬元亦同時解凍。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕根據兩個會議不久將在貝爾格勒召集之事，此舉更富有意義。南共大會將於廿一日在南國京城開冪，多瑙河航行自由會議廿九日在南國京城召開，屆時美·法·英代表將注意狄托如何依靠莫斯科陣綫。此美用間之經濟解決，乃緊接於狄托面臨蘇聯集團國家在經濟阻撓日盛之際。</p>
<h3>原子彈失蹤說　美海部否認</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿日電〕美海軍人士頃否認退役前海軍諜報官員　卡里斯海軍少將昨在電台節目中所稱，太平洋戰爭將結束時，載運原子彈一枚之美艦一艘在中途失踪之說。聲明從未有載運原子彈之海軍船舶曾經失踪。薩氏謂該艦係於駛赴馬里亞納海軍基地鐵寗島途中失踪。</p>

<h3>鐵索郎當翁仲去矣　焚香拜送愚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕愚民尊爲神靈之跑馬廳對面一對石翁仲，已於昨日由工務局會同警察局拆除，暫時棄置閘北宋公園。拆遷工作於上午八時許開始，工務同派營造處建築科長葛德銘率技工十八人執行，警察局派新成分局及保安總隊　士二十餘人荷槍實彈警戒，並於近旁地上置輕機關槍一架，以防止愚民阻　。靠東之翁仲首遭厄運，其下部且斜裂一大塊，因其　體係劣質靑石所製，以四五十年之歷史，經日夜香火之熏炙，遂不堪震動而吿碎裂。東翁仲於上午十時半吊離　座，西翁仲至下午始拆畢。</p>
<p>吊懸空中尊嚴盡失</p>
<p>拆除方法，係由技工先將座脚　鬆，然後在　牆與電　間架起一根橫木，裝置起重齒輸（技工稱之爲「神仙軸轤」），綱將　練套住翁仲頭頸，又用粗索縛住翁仲腰部，一端則套於起重齒輪之鐵鈎上，在齒輪轉動之下，重達三噸餘之翁仲開始動搖，繼即懸空吊起後平放於地面。當此鐵索可噹之龐然大物曳蕩於空中之際，雖形容依舊，而昔日尊嚴，似已消失殆盡矣。拆除之際，隔馬路跑馬廳前人行道上觀者如堵，往來車輛中之乘客亦爭相探首外望，交通受相當影響。時尙有若干善男信女携香燭錫箔等前來，爲警士阻斥，此輩愚民竟轉入新昌路上向牆壁叩首膜拜。圍觀之人　中則議論紛紛，有謂「罪過罪過」者，有謂「石菩薩如有靈，拆的人應該馬上肚皮痛」者。</p>
<p>有人要求保管未果</p>
<p>兩翁仲拆下後，忽有市參議員張中原及銀幕「壞蛋」洪警鈴前來，聲稱已得物主米高梅公司委託組織保管委員會，要求將拆下之翁仲搬往西寶興路嚴家　路復興普渡善堂。但工務局人員以未奉上峯命令，不允所請，仍將兩石人車往宋公園。洪等力爭無效，聲稱決向市政府交涉以達到目的。故翁仲今後遭遇如何，尙在未定之數。而昨晚翁仲原址前竟仍有不少愚夫愚婦認爲「神　　去，神靈尙在」，故仍前來向空　膜拜，香火且更盛於往日。　上尙有黑字「給許多太平予親愛的中國，賜快樂繁榮予上海的人民」，然觀乎翁仲愚人魔力之深，則其賜予中國者，　爲市政當局之一通串麻煩也。</p>

<h3>移花接木借屍還魂　川教界一重公案　冒名頂替做校長</h3>
<p>〔本報成都十八日航訊〕川敎育界怪現象層出不窮，頃發生省立達縣中學校長，冒名頂替大怪劇。事實經過數年，情節曲折離奇，實爲敎育界空前未有之怪現狀。</p>
<p>緣現任川省立達縣中學校長蘇集（本名蘇培元），係去年底敎廳長任覺五新委。蘇培元原籍四川涪陵，曾在涪陵縣高中肆業，抗戰時，在陪都某機關任辦事員，適有川灌縣籍之蘇集，曾留學法國，時任職某部，兩機關比隣辦公，宿舍後衡宇相望時敵機肆虐，警報頻繁，蘇集與其夫人經常至附近防空洞躱避，遂常與蘇培元晤面，彼此漸通款曲。某次，敵機大炸市區，彈中該防空洞，蘇集不幸中彈重傷，遂殉國難，適在混亂中，蘇培元無意拾得皮包一隻，檢視知爲蘇集所遣，內貯彼學歷經歷全部證明文件，乃珍藏留用。其後，蘇集夫人後常與蘇培元在防空洞相晤，形影相吊，日久戀生，由戀愛而同居，培元始吿以拾得證件經過，於是遂互爲設計，由培元　蘇集之名，時蘇集夫人老父某正任某部要職，乃由伊宛轉詳陳老父，從權諒解，爲介紹另一較高職務。</p>
<p>勝利後，蘇集藉丈人峯之介，任敎部督學，並飛赴錦州·瀋陽等地視察，去年底返川，携朱家驛部長介紹函，晤川敎廳長任覺五，因此資歷背景，且與任氏同鄕（任亦灌縣籍）遂被任省立達縣中學校長。蘇對涪陵同鄉，自稱涪陵籍，對灌縣稱灌縣籍，而此一重公案亦深爲敎育界所熟知。最近川省參會大會中，已有人提出檢舉，敎廳正澈査眞象。</p>

<h3>川陜鄂邊境　真空地帶填補問題</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員歐陽醇</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十八日航訊〕自國防部宣佈成立「川陜甘邊區」，由重慶綏靖公署直轄指揮以來，陜南的防務已由西安綏靖公署轉移至重慶綏署的職掌中了，這在防範共匪由陝鄂邊境入川的戰略上，是有着極大的意義的。</p>
<p>記者在「川陜鄂邊境，大巴山防務」的一簾通訊（刋四月十八日本報）上，曾經詳述共匪侵川，勢必經由下列三道路綫：（一）由陜南鎭巴竄滾龍坡進萬源，（二）由紫陽經大竹河入川，（三）由鄂西竄鷄心嶺進巫溪。孔從周匪部自從在四月間佔據了陝南白河，洵陽後，（按：洵腸現在國軍手中）始終沒有放棄竄擾安康的企圖。如果安康不守，國軍要在大巴山邊緣抵禦共匪的侵入，確非易事。鄧錫侯主任即曾對本報記者一再强調：「大巴山設防，不足以阻檔共匪。加强陜南安康與漢中的防務，才是禦匪於川外唯一的途徑」。他認爲如果共匪沿大巴山岡攻萬源，城口，巫溪，僅祗是竄擾的性質，主力一定圖攻漢中，企佔廣元，因爲共匪侵川的主要目的，在於爭兵源，奪糧食。</p>
<p>針對這個事實，防守大巴山的勁旅「益陽」部已由原駐地開拔至陝南某地，雖然「益陽」部在孔匪的廣播中說是「沒有作過戰的部隊」，但熟悉軍情的人士多知道：盤踞鄂北鄖西，鄖縣的孔匪，白河的譚道鵬匪，已在開始徬徨寒悚了。因爲「益陽」部是抗戰勝利後，國軍中惟一未曾消耗過的有力部隊，數年來駐紮川康邊境。川南，川中，川東北，是安定西南的砥柱。</p>
<p>川陜邊境國軍的指揮機構已經統一了，但川陝鄂邊境，據悉還是一片眞空。數月來，由白河卡十街南竄鄂西竹山，竹谿的匪股，始終未有澈底的肅淸，控制兩竹的據點得勝舖，國軍就失而復得過幾次。竹山最緊張的時期，是共匪竄抵了離縣城僅數十里的北星河塘，十五綏靖區才感覺情勢嚴重，派了第八區保安副司令陳雲率領指揮人員前往竹山縣城坐鎭。孔匪如果在陜南及鄂北一帶遭受國軍的壓力，一定會竄向鄂西這塊眞空地帶。如何部署鄂西的防務，防堵共匪竄擾川東，則是目前重慶綏署與第十五綏靖區面臨的重要課題。</p>

<h3>當局抽緊銀根拋售物資　物價昨全面下降　大鈔發行後市場反映轉好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲大鈔發行之第二日，因有關當局有計劃拋售物資，致銀根緊俏，暗息高昂，物價普遍回跌。華股部門，如永紗美亞新光等十三種熱門股，因多方傾吐，行市傾瀉，均告跌停，米粉油糧，亦因銀根緊俏，買氣不旺，約回跌一成左右。自粳跌至三千六百萬，特粳回至三千九百萬。紗市因受紡建臨時配售影響，下跌尤烈，市價較前日約回跌二成。日用品除少數商品如肥皂香烟外，行市亦稍稍軋跌。目前央行爲穩定市塲抵銷大鈔發行之影響起見，對米糖紗布等日用物品，決有計劃大規模配售，以抽緊銀根，抑止漲風。昨日國家行局差入之頭寸，即在一萬二千億以上。央行方面且表示：目下該行掌握之棉紗達十六萬包，食糖足數全市兩月之需。昨日紡建五千包紗之配售即可吸收現鈔八萬億。同時中信局前以每箱一百入十萬元之代價向義大利購進之人絲二千箱，亦已於本月十八日抵埠，下週起即可恢復人絲配售。目前金融當局之政策，顯欲　拋售物資之手段，防止物價之激漲，便在一個半月之後，得與美援之運用相啣接。</p>
<h3>銀根緊勢加厲　傾股仁九傾跌</h3>
<p>華股昨在國行有計劃之壓力下，銀根奇緊，九角個洋，尙難拆到。各物咸回，難逃例外，除梅林聯地漲停外，慘跌者十之九。</p>
<p>晨初仍難振作，永紗以一〇八五〇元登塲，二一三號七六號等及廣帮二〇二號紛售，陸績慘瀉，中途縱有小回，無濟於事。復由六〇號一六號等賣到一〇二五〇元一九三號一三一號等雖進至一〇四〇〇元，一八〇號一二一號等賣到一〇一二五元跌停限度。銀根涓滴未能拆到，五四號一三四號等再賣到跌限以下九九〇〇元內結束，跌至限度者有閘北華豐新光勤興美亞景綸中絲等，除梅林聯地漲停，統益平平外，餘均跌半成至一成强不等。</p>
<p>後市得過且過，永紗開高爲一〇三〇〇元，一二號一八七號等進至一〇六五〇元一三七號一六儿號五四號進後有售，預料國行差進將逾三萬億，即起回風。更由一四五號及銀行帮二二〇號五六號二〇七號等賣到一〇二五〇元始轉盤局。國行差進一萬餘億，形勢不定，永紗以一〇四〇〇元收市，收後喊價低至一〇三五〇元以下。較晨收計梅林仍站漲限，統益尙平，永紗美亞信和勤興麗安中絲商務新華微升，恒豐景福新光榮豐內衣景綸永公麗安國貨中法漲半成，塲外各未上市股票，以文化紡織股回小半成較疲，餘尙平庸。</p>
<p>公債昨亦告回頭，統丙晨開一一二萬，低至一〇〇萬，而後稍穩。成交四百餘萬。較前收計甲乙降六萬元，丙跌九萬元，丁挫七萬元，戊種跌十萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市產價報升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲據茶業界對記者談稱：自大鈔發行，本市茶葉市况，一度曾起蠢動，但在銀根緊俏中，旋轉平和，而目前則已波及產區茶商，聞喊價迭吿扶搖直上，幾與本市茶價並駕齊驅，如再加運費及一切繳用等，恐須超過滬地行情，因此到源漸趨滯狄。综觀此種情形，本市同業互做價，勢將跟蹤達價而步升云。</p>
<p>昨日茶市：賣戶雖圖高扳，但在各物下游中，故買方心思亦抱看跌，是以觀望不前，過程欲昂無力，臨收結果，終呈盤局，交易不多。</p>
<h3>人絲劇跌</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市跌風甚厲，較上日短去四億元强，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤念一億六千萬元有一箱交易，旋因供多求少，節節降跌。即期最小降至十八億元，收盤時稍吿好轉，喊十九億元賣出價，一天套利，因銀根緊俏，最大做至一億八千萬，後首做一億六千萬元，下午開盤二十億元賣出價，一度升至念億〇五千萬元，收盤降爲十九億元。最後塲外又降至十八億六千萬元，結果比上日跌去四億五千萬元。</p>
<p>廠經　昨市劇降，且交易極稀少，因銀根甚緊，買戶供吿束手，高零担念一億元有成交，不過貸款有三四天期頭，其餘各級均乏成交，喊價比上日約短三億元之　。干經行情，昨亦跟隨低落。</p>
<h3>義大利人絲兩千箱到滬</h3>
<p>中信局前向義大利購進之人造絲約計兩千箱，業已裝運來滬，現正辦理結關卸貨手續中。下月初即可開始配售。據悉：該項人造絲經中信局向義大利購進者甚多，將分批裝運來氾。</p>
<h3>輸管華南分會　院令輸結束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會頃奉行政院令，着即裁撤華南分會，該會奉令後已積極辦理結束。又　管會華南分會副主委兼廣州區辦事處長田定庵辭職曰照准，　缺由輸管會簽證室主任許振南繼任，許氏不日即赴穗履新，簽證室事務則由該室副主任施德潛暫行代理。</p>

<h3>多頭競吐人心虛怯　棉紗布一致挫跌</h3>

<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初喊十六億五千萬元，即瀉一億七千萬，中途曾回上至十七億。詎至十一點半紡建公司又突然懸牌，拋售廿支金城等五種，價亦低廉，市呈供過於求，卒以現出十五億五千萬結束，比上日再瀉二億七千萬元。其餘各支組細紗布，亦因多頭忍痛斬售，賣氣濃厚，行情頻降，大都軋小一·二億至三·四億不一，全日成交七十二件。</p>
<p>棉布市况，因大票發行後，當局即大量拋售物資，以期收縮通貨，防杜投機，昨又逢紡建公司標售五福細布，及嗶嘰坯布等十二種，花管會亦再度特配雙魚及足球細布，業中人遭受銀根緊逼，被迫而吐售者甚夥，人心因此頓呈虛怯，塲內賣氣奇濃。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開市盤即吿下瀉四百萬元，嗣在供多求少下，終以四千四百萬元收市，比上日猛瀉九百萬元。收後再降一百萬有成交，塲外軋小六百萬元。其他嗶嘰細斜粗布等，亦一致勁挫。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡代紗管會昨拋紗六八一件，計金額七，〇二〇億。又中紡牌售棉布一三九〇〇疋，被單四二〇條，計金額六四，五六四，〇〇〇萬。再第十九次棉花標售，共得法幣三〇，五八六，六〇〇萬。</p>
<h3>食米市況下游　粉糧食油均見下降</h3>

<p>麺粉急遽下降，由於銀根之緊迫，貨主不惜低價求脫，市乃急轉直下。老車開市爲一一七〇萬，後步小至一〇五〇萬收市，兵船收市一〇〇〇萬，紅蜂·建成·致跌進千萬大關，各較上日猛跌三百萬元。麩皮退至八百萬邊，小包麩下午六百二十五萬。</p>
<p>雜糧反動回跌，因銀根大緊，執貨者急於求現，紛紛求脫，供應驟增，價格一致疾退。漢口乍豆收市一五一〇萬，勁跌達三百九十萬。苞米元麥上日多屬退交，昨乃激落五六百萬，蠶豆及菉豆齊跌三百萬，芝蔴降三百萬，生仁上日扒盤甚多，猛降八百萬。</p>

<p>該校常年經費係由中法大學按月撥付，並由各行廠捐助儀器標本。戰前敎育部對該校有硏究費補助，廣西省政府亦曾以公費委託該校訓練藥劑師，政府對藥典之編纂，藥法之修正檢討，藥事人員之考試，藥科課程之編制等，亦多委託該校敎授代辦。該校亦曾出版藥物分析法，藥劑學實驗法，毒物學分析法等書籍。</p>
<p>招生</p>
<p>該校本屆招收新生約四十名，考生須注重英文·生物·及化學。因該校最近調査在校學生成績中以化學最差，生物及英文亦未臻理想。故在入學考試時將對該數科水準，略予提高。</p>

<h3>千五百米權威　世界紀錄保持人　瑞典史特蘭成功史　世運會中冠軍呼聲最高的一位</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦通訊〕假使瑞典神速的一哩賽跑家史特蘭，從未做到「與野兎同跑，與獵犬同獵」的不可能境地，他確已從最初「野兎」的地位，進至追逐者的身份了。由其跟哈格和安特遜陪跑所表演的成績，瑞典和全世界第一次認識了他的可能造就。</p>
<p>他在瑪爾　加入體育會的時候，年已二十，並已以榮手聞名。</p>
<p>史特蘭原在瑪爾摩一家報館裏祖任排字的工作，他還彈得一手好鋼琴，一年前曾在瑞典京城開過一個現代音樂演奏會。那家報館後來把他調到體育部去，現在他在報上，有他自己的體育專欄。</p>
<p>史特蘭初出的時候專胞半哩，但是一般專家，不久就看出這個脆弱的鋼琴家，以跑一千五百米爲宜。哈格其時已遷至瑪爾摩，加人了體育會，他和史特蘭一起在城外的樹林中練習，知道內情的人，便開始說這個新進者，有一天可以成爲大賽跑家。</p>
<p>哈格訓練着他的「野兎」。另一個著名瑞典一英哩賽跑家安特遜，也有他的份兒，這兩個人好幾次由史特蘭同跑，造成世界紀錄，他們跟「理想哩」（四分鐘）祗差一秒鐘了，史特蘭在一九四四年最佳的成績，是一千五百米三分五十五秒。</p>
<p>在一季之內，他已一躍而入世界選手之林，下一年第一次的比賽，便以三分四十七秒跑畢一千五百米，他打破了洛芙洛克的世界紀錄，但是屈居第二位，尙在安特遜之下。</p>
<p>哈格和史特萊正繼續共同練習，準備將一哩紀錄破進四分關時，這個從前的「野兎」，突然發現自己孤獨無伴了，哈格和安特遜都被暫禁比賽，不久且被宣吿爲非業餘家了。</p>
<p>哈格在幾年前曾赴美國比賽，現在史特蘭也去了，於是成爲美國的冠軍，他回到歐洲後，一九四六年又在奧斯羅囊括了歐洲錦標。</p>
<p>去年七月十八日，他以三分四十三秒跑畢一千五百米，恰巧平等哈格的世界紀錄，他和第二名的艾立克遜都不知道自己跑的怎快。史特　在賽後自作評語說：「我們該很容易的在四分鐘內跑完一哩呀。」史特蘭旣奪得瑞典錦標，正擬小休，却又接受了巴黎的邀請前去比賽，不料竟遭逢到二年中的第一次敗北，優勝的是漢森，史特蘭屈居第五。</p>
<p>在史特蘭和世運會的金牌之間，祗有一樣障礙，這就是他的神經過敏，他在任何一次比賽之前，即使他的敵手，是第二流的選手，總極其心神不寗像第一次登台的演員一般。有一次他曾不穿背心便去上塲比賽，他的朋友們担心他或許有一天會一絲不掛的上塲去呢。（按史特關爲于五百米三分四十三秒世界紀錄保持者，今年世運曾冠軍呼聲最高之一人。）</p>

<h3>煞車要緊</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>在上海，人們每見黄包車夫跌交，乘客也跌了出來的時候，向例是大家團在四週哈哈大笑，決不上前攙扶；有時還要稱之日「釣魚」。若跌交的乘客是靑年女子，瞧熱鬧的看客們便格外高興，一定要高聲加上幾句下作的說話，以見自己的俏皮。</p>
<p>若跌交的不是黄包車而是三輪車呢，也有一種「俏皮」的稅法，呌做「倒垃圾」。仔細想想，倒也要佩服想出這些話來的人們—佩服他們永遠這樣輕輕易易地保持着全世界最無聊最卑怯的最高紀錄！</p>
<p>平心而論，上海的馬路總算是平坦的。雖然在交通極擁擠的時候，後面的三輪車紫常會撞到前一輛車子的後身去，呌坐在前面車上的人感到像是背心中央挨到一拳，蛤車子翻身亦卽所謂「倒垃圾」者，實在並不多見。然而「不多見」並不等於「不可能」，如果你常常坐三輪車從虹口過橋到中區去，你就會感覺到這個「可能性」的存在。</p>
<p>坐三輪車過橋的時候，車夫一到橋堍就先跳了下來，個　着身體拖三輪車上橋，那種沉着氣一步步慢慢走着的樣子，簡直就像江南水鄕常見的拉縴的人。如果剛剛碰着下雨，橋堍上一片濕淋淋的水光，更是非常難走，萬一他脚下一滑，乘車的人就難免要在衆人譁笑之下，嘗一嘗「垃圾」的味道了。好不容易辛辛苦苦到了橋的中央，那位三輪車夫才似乎鬆了一口氣。</p>
<p>不過，那位三輪車夫雖已「如釋重負」，坐車的人却還是絕對不能「釋然於懷」。下橋實在比上橋更危險。上橋時，有的時候還有那些襤褸的小孩子們推你一下，省掉了車夫不少力氣；而且，惟其是慢慢的一步一步的走，遇險卽止，倒不容易出什麼大毛病。下車時却大不相同：但覓車夫飛身上車，以閃電姿態直向橋下衝去，嘴裏雖然不斷地發出整吿性的吆喝，可是驚心動魄的鏡頭却實在不一而足。衝得太快，固然容易和迎面而來的汽車三輪車撞個滿懷，而前面踽踽而行的老虎車橡皮車若不及相讓，尤其容易惹出滔天大禍。衝得太慢呢，後面又有如飛而下的三輪車緊接而來，你慢他快，結果還是一撞。</p>
<p>在這種時候，轉危爲安的關鍵一半是在三輪車夫的本領，一半就要看三輪車的「煞車」靈不靈。「煞車」如果靈活，則懸崖之馬可勒，乘客的安全可期；否則——也就不必再說了。</p>
<p>說到此地，要入正文了，坐三輪車不過是一個譬喻。</p>
<p>大鈔出來了。大鈔是需要的，前幾天我的內人要爲孩子準備一點冬衣，結果是手裏提了一大包的鈔票上街，旣添麻煩，尤不雅觀，買好了東西要等店夥點鈔票，看他一疊一疊地點得不耐煩，蛤爲道義起見，還是一定要他點完了才走。一件羊毛衫的體積祗及買它時用掉的鈔票體積的十分之一，回來時雖覺輕鬆，却不免又頗發思古之幽情，想起了不知多少年前米祗賣十塊錢一担的日子。這思古之幽情一來，便自然而然的又想到會不會「後之視今，亦猶今之視昔」了。做官的老爺們坐的是新汽車，當然不見得會知道三輪車何以會「倒垃圾」的道理，但汽車的「煞車」亦頗重要，「煞車」不靈，也許滿腹經天緯地之才的老爺們就不免受驚，弄得不巧還要使我們這個多難的國家失掉一位好不容易才蒙「同意」的大官，豈不麻煩？故曰：煞車實在要緊——</p>
<p>一張鈔票五百萬元，「五」字後面已經拖了六個圈了！再不煞車，留心「垃圾」！</p>
<h3>太陽眼鏡</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>美國最近舉行了一次「泛美眼科會議」，當有一位德克撒斯州的馬太博士發表了一篇關於太陽眼鏡的論文。他說，常戴深色的太陽眼鏡，可能養成一種非戴不可的習慣，每逢光綫太亮時，不戴太陽眼鏡就會覺得受不往。但如果選擇顏色較淡的太陽眼鏡，就沒有什麽害處。他特別說明，任何人如果以爲戴了太陽眼鏡就不妨眼對太陽，那就非吃虧不可。即使是最好的太陽眼鏡，你如果戴了牠就對太陽看，你的眼睛一定受傷，而且有時這傷勢是很嚴重的。科學家若要觀察太陽，必須另備一種特製的眼鏡，萬萬不可用太陽眼鏡代替，</p>
<h3>紀念矗耳忌辰的音樂會</h3>
<p>— 知微</p>
<p>七月十七日是已故音樂家聶耳先生的忌辰，在音樂界凋零的今日，雖是人才比較集中的上海，也聽不到什麼音樂界有紀念會的消息，只有八仙橋靑年會在十六日下午舉行了一場音樂舞踊大曾，算是一代樂人忌日的點綴。</p>
<p>那天，天氣相當熱，靑年會大禮堂的四百多隻位子不到七時早已滿座，可是愛好音樂舞踊的朋友，還是絡續地擁進去，許多聽衆只得站着，總計觀衆不下一千二百餘人。</p>
<p>第一個節目是該會第一學生歌詠團的合唱，有田爾編的綏遠民謠「城上跑馬」等曲，歌聲悠揚，有置身邊境荒鄉僻壤之感，不脫民歌本色。第二個節目是王福康男中音獨唱「思鄕曲」，「把一朶花放在窗前」等。其他如音專王之湘，楊安眞之女高昔獨唱，也很精彩。三節舞蹈節目都經化裝，穿邊疆民服，中以「山上荒地」最熱鬧，艷裝奇舞，深博觀衆好評，舞後掌聲不絕，欲罷不能。最後節目是百人大合唱，塲面偉大，且因合小不敷容納，一直排至台下。計唱聶耳先生之遺作「大路歌」，「義勇軍進行曲」，及抗戰時後方流行之「幹一塲」，「抗戰勝利八年到」等，歌聲響亮雄壯，而以鼓·羅·鈸等爲伴奏，更是特色，極令人奮發振作。</p>
<p>散會時已十點鐘，筆者深深感到，在電影限價票高漲至四十萬，靡靡之音籠罩全上海的今日，兩袖淸風的公敎人員和一般不甘隨俗浮沈的純正靑年，實在缺乏調劑精神的正當娛樂。像這樣的音樂舞踊會眞是値得提倡的。</p>
<h3>畫家的奇癖</h3>
<p>— 睡禪</p>
<p>大凡是什麼家之流，多少有點奇癖，尤其是書畫家。舉一個例，如臨桂　又韓—維琦—先生，便有奇癖。又韓在海上賣　已有好多年了，凡是見過他的人，都覺得他和藹可親，那準是不會錯的。可是在他寫畫的時候，便不然了。他寫了那麽許多的畫，據他自己說，沒有一張布局相同的。眞的，我從沒有見過他兩張同樣的畫。這固然顯出他胸中的丘壑萬千，但他不到靈感勃發的時候，却決不肯下筆。因此你看他一天到晚，談天，抽烟，悠然自得，好像無所事事似的。一到靈感忽來的時候，便拋下了一切，正襟危坐，運筆如飛。凡是「識相」一點的朋友，最好靜靜地退出，不要攪亂他的詩情盡意，否則便有「面斥莫怪」的危險。好在他寫畫總在夜深人靜的時候，還不至於開罪「貴客」；幾個老朋友，模熟了他的脾氣，早就跑了。無論如何，他總是認眞寫畫的，下筆已有千秋之想。</p>
<p>他的潤華並不太貴，然而在他高興的時候，一下子就是幾紙，不高興的時候，却又一筆不肯輕下。生平最怕理髮。他說一理了髮，便得生病三天，不管百事。請他寫書而剛在他理髮之後，那便是該「倒楣」。幸而他理髮一年不過三四次，而且說也奇怪，頭髮也不會長的太長。請他寫畫，最好看一看他的頭髮長短，越長便越有精神，實得也越好。還有一點，要他畫得快，畫得好，非由他夫人督促不可。說起他的夫人，恰是大名鼎鼎的醫家，錢太希—罕—的千金，博學而又多才。在他口中，常聽到他念着柳屯田的一句詞，叫做「況有狂朋怪侶。」「況」字作實字用，指他的姓，「怪侶」便是指他的夫人，狂朋」也是一位大書家，陳蒙　—運彰。原來又韓的尊人是況　風先生—淸季四大詞人之一—這句柳詞，想來他從小就聽慣了的，所以引用得恰到好處。大槪沒有這兩位「狂朋怪侶」，他的畫興便提不起來了。有「次，我想請他畫個扇面，又要快，又要好，於是改變策略，先詣他的「狂朋」，寫上一通小褚字，趁他不在家的時候送去，他那「怪侶」便收下了。果然一到晚上，他把畫好的扇面，巴巴地親自送了來，不消說是旣快且好，那位「狂朋」，便替他下了八個字的評語：證是「能標新意，不離正則」。</p>
<p>馬克吐溫的幽默　牟敦珮</p>
<p>一次，幽默大師馬克·吐溫，在火車上發現與他同房的有兩人，一個是副牧師，另一個是貨物推銷員。這時，馬克·吐溫感覺異常疲倦，很想打個瞌睡，可是那個推銷員，却反覆的對那頗有忍耐心的牧師高聲談天，悠然自得，毫無倦意。</p>
<p>馬克·吐溫急的沒法，便走過對他們說：「讓我來問你們一個問題。你們可知道，在一個蠢笨的人與一個副牧師之間，有何不同？」</p>
<p>「不知道」，副牧師順口答出。</p>
<p>「我知道」，推銷負得意洋洋地說：「一個牧師把他的十字架戴在他的胸前，而蠢笨的人，卻把他的十字架戴在他背上。」</p>
<p>馬克·吐溫突然起立，很嚴厲的注視着他道：「你可知道，一儸驢子與一個旅行推銷員，有何區別？」</p>
<p>「不知道。」推銷員回答。</p>
<p>「我也不知道！」馬克·吐溫莊嚴地說完之後，就迅速的走回去睡覺。</p>
<p>這時，這一個副牧師與推銷員，却因各人的問題而納悶，再也不高談闊論了。馬克·吐溫安然入睡。</p>
<h3>招待不週</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>某甲上芝加哥一家生意興隆的餐館去吃早餐。女侍應生將咖啡和土司遞給他以後，隔了十分鐘，才將他所點的橘子汁送去，某甲頗表不滿。</p>
<p>女侍應生問：「你結過婚沒有？」某甲說：「結過了—與你何干？」女侍應生說：「嗯，那末你爲什麼不在家中吃早飯？」</p>
<p>某次，電影演員維克多·麥克勞倫，在從寓所赴好萊塢途中，上路旁所設的一家專售鷄肉的舖子內進食。他等了三刻鐘，侍者姗姗來遲的將他點的半　童子鷄放在他面前。麥克勞倫質問他爲什麼要躭擱這許多時候。他答道：「我們要等另一位顧客同樣點半只童子鷄時，才能將雞殺掉，然後一起　製。</p>
<p>某顧客在美國聖太摩尼加城內一家點心店內吃汕前餅，他祗咬了兩口，女侍應生已將他的盆子取去，用布抹拭糧台。此人說：「喂，我只吃了兩口呢！」</p>
<p>那個女人眼睛也不　，另取出元整的油煎餅一枚，咬去兩口，把吃剩的放在顧客的盆子內。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>前者因一般了無意識之一選皇后」（如校后，市后，國大后之類）而略談「后」與Queen之異解，及幼稚的模仿歐風之誤，今復聯想及於伶界有所謂「老生大王」，「旦角大王」者，此蓋起於「譚迷家」之標榜譚　培氏（即狄楚老庚子　事許「國自興亡誰管得，滿城爭說呌天兒」之「叫天兒」，又日「小呌天」者是）。前淸時稱之曰「譚貝勒」，以其時淸室未亡，滿淸貴爵名詞爲一般腐化者所樂道，「貝勒」即淸語，亦王爵之一種也。至民國譚鑫培有上海之行時，則滿式已失運背時，洋派洋味之名詞代之而興，「煤油大王」「汽車大王」「馬戯大王」「橡膠大王」之徵號觸目皆是，於是「貝勒」又換「大王」之新　，由旗味而洋味焉。此「大王」雖中國字，然非其舊義，而實慕自　來物之King，正如校后市后之后，乃慕西式之Queen，而與舊時宮中之后，殊無關係。</p>
<p>「大王」雖舊有此稱，惟周代列國戰國之時爲最盛，其時固無皇帝，即周天子亦只是王位。「天下歸往謂之王」，孟子所謂「王天下」（王字去聲，乃動詞非名詞），能爲「王」，即至尊無上，天下共主矣。及周室浸衰，所封建各國，互相侵伐，又各自稱雄，自加王號，又稱「大王」。如此風氣，以戰國七雄爲最高潮。及泰併六國，混一區宇，稱「始皇帝」，漢代從之，以後天子爲皇帝，而以「王」爲高級封爵，或稱瀋列土，或在朝享　。至於滿淸親工郡王等，皆只封　而不封建。官員士民稱之日「王爺」，並無「大王」之說。惟小說中如西游記之山棈水怪，則稱「大王」，說岳中牛　爲寇，稱「公道大王」。其他大盜　稱「山大王」，則「大王」者，妖怪也，盜寇也。</p>
<p>歐風東漸，凡以商工業稱雄，或以一技獨佔優勢，輒曰King，譯之日「某某大王」，而「大王」之名復活，然與　時同名而異實。譚　培之「大王」，是「海洋派」，是「時髦」，並非「京朝派」，不可不知。</p>

<h3>Bloody Battles to Defend Taiyuan's Suburbs; Outlying Stronghold Garrisons Break Through to Concentrate; Weather Improves, Air Transport of Reinforcements Continues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th Dispatch] A source related: Battles are occurring in areas within ten li of Taiyuan's outskirts. Communist bandits' main forces have also been discovered in the Lancun and Huangtuzhai areas north of the city. Yan Xishan has again telegraphed the President, requesting Hu Zongnan to send troops to southern Shanxi to exert a restraining effect. Furthermore, the Beiping Telegraph Bureau will, starting today, refuse to accept commercial telegrams destined for Taiyuan; only official and military telegrams will be transmitted between Beiping and Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th Dispatch] (1) Pei Changhui's army corps, under the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, has been successively flying to Taiyuan for reinforcement since the 17th. The vanguard, the 30th Division, had completely arrived the day before yesterday. The last batch of this division suffered some losses when landing, due to bombardment by bandit artillery fire. (2) Fierce fighting has broken out along the west bank of the Fen River southwest of Taiyuan, in the areas of Daxiaojingyu, Xiaowangcun, Shagouxincun, Yijing, and Nanyan. Wang Jingguo led a strong army corps and at one point recovered Daxiaojingyu and Xiaowangcun, annihilating over a thousand bandits, but they fell again after the bandits reinforced.</p>

<h3>Customs Import Tax and Commodity Tax Amended and Passed by the Legislative Yuan; Salt Tax Not Increased, Flour Tax Exempted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Legislative Yuan held its third secret meeting all day on the 20th, chaired by Sun Ke, with over 400 members in attendance. In the morning, the report from the Finance and Economic Committee on the revised draft of the customs import tariff was discussed, and it was passed with the proposed revisions. Subsequently, the Finance and Economic Committee, together with the Maritime Affairs Committee, reported on the review of the Executive Yuan's request for deliberation on the Salt Tax Rate Ordinance. The original draft stipulated a tax of four yuan per dan of edible salt based on pre-war currency value, adjusted according to the wholesale price index. The review opinion resolved to retain the current rate. However, during the meeting on the 20th, Chen Kewen, Zou Shuwen, and others advocated for the passage of the original proposal, arguing that it would provide ample revenue for the national treasury with a minimal burden on each person. This was met with strong opposition from Chen Mingxian, Yue Shuyou, Xu Pan'yun, Xie Chengyu, and others, who believed that increasing the salt tax would universally increase the burden on the general public, amounting to a poll tax. They argued that the state should increase revenue by focusing on wealthier individuals. After the debate, it was put to a vote, and only 94 members (out of 314 present) supported the Executive Yuan's original proposal. The review opinion was upheld, and the salt tax will continue to be levied at the current rate, without modification. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The customs import tariff will be thoroughly revised and implemented by the Ministry of Finance as soon as legislative procedures are completed. Except for the tariff rates stipulated in the Geneva Agreement passed by the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference and the reduction rates agreed to by our country, all of which will be observed, the tariff rates on essential items for economic construction and daily necessities for the people will not be increased. In addition, most of the tariff item numbers (672 items) have been revised. For luxury goods, non-essential items for the general public, or those that can already be produced in large quantities domestically, and for the sake of protecting industry, import tariff rates will be increased based on their use, degree of processing, and relationship with domestic goods (whether they are competing products), with an average increase of one to three times the current tariff rates. The highest rates are for alcohol and tobacco, at 200 percent. For steamships, however, a tax exemption was decided upon as an incentive due to insufficient domestic tonnage. Diesel fuel, being a necessary commodity for domestic use, will maintain the current tax rate of 18 percent.</p>

<h3>The Survival of Economic Control Agencies</h3>
<p>Economic control agencies, under various names, have flourished for a time. Some are national in scope, while others are limited to a corner; some are permanent in nature, while others are temporarily established. Changes in names and personnel, and shifts in organization and scope, are especially rapid and overwhelming. What is the ultimate benefit to the country and the people, and what is the extent of the remedy for the current economic situation? The facts are right in front of us, and it seems there is no need for much inference. Take the Financial Management Bureau as an example. In Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, many of the people originally in charge have also resigned one after another, turning their heads and ignoring the situation. What is the reason? It is worth pondering.</p>
<p>During wartime, military and economic matters were equally important. The topic was too broad, and many people who held doubts had to maintain a solemn attitude and wait for developments. However, since the victory, the economic situation has deteriorated rapidly, to the point where the more it is controlled, the worse it becomes, almost mirroring the "the more suppressed, the more expensive" phenomenon during the Anti-Japanese War. Moreover, some unscrupulous officials, taking advantage of their positions, engaged in corruption and extortion, further creating a negative impression. What is even more peculiar is that even institutions that are not primarily responsible are joining in the excitement and claiming to be economic control agencies, exercising their powers. As a result, the so-called control agencies have become even more complex and incomprehensible, and calls and proposals to abolish these types of control agencies have finally erupted in the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>In all fairness, it is worth exploring whether a laissez-faire policy can be fully adopted during this extraordinary period. In particular, most opinions believe that implementing management is still necessary for exchange rate policy and foreign trade policy. However, economic control, whether domestic or foreign, is nothing more than to shorten the long and make up for the short, and to seek the highest efficiency. The means may be similar to negative ones, but the intention is always positive. In terms of the meaning of control, it may be necessary to impose considerable restrictions on the economic behavior of a certain part or a certain period, but in terms of the entire business, the focus is ultimately on supporting, promoting, and developing in a planned manner, rather than simply restricting, suppressing, and deliberately antagonizing industrial and commercial enterprises, ultimately causing harm to the country and the people. Therefore, economic control, also known as planned economy, is obviously different from blindly or maliciously destroying industrial and commercial enterprises, and even more different from those means of profiteering and self-enrichment that have other effects!</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, whether or not this type of control agency should be abolished, the key is whether past and existing facts can prove that it is beneficial to the country; that is to say, whether these agencies are blindly or deliberately destroying the economy, or whether they are promoting it in a planned manner. If it is said that they are promoting it in a planned manner, do their words and deeds match? Are there any achievements that can be shared with others? Is there anyone, especially some executors, who is taking advantage of it and only realizing their side effects?</p>
<p>Superficially, any institution has its reasons for existence; superficially, any institution also has its window dressing to cover up. However, window dressing is, after all, window dressing. In reality, they have made the national economy so chaotic! Don't you see the control of foreign exchange? Those who have their own foreign exchange, regardless of whether they are prepared to import machines or necessities or luxuries, are blindly shut out of the country; overseas Chinese funds are all flowing to Hong Kong because of the unrealistic exchange rate. In terms of trade control, exports cannot be promoted, and foreign raw materials cannot be imported due to the lack of foreign exchange, but they turn a blind eye to the smuggling of many domestic products and the smuggling of a large number of purely consumable goods and luxury goods. As for the control of yarn and cloth, despite shouting the slogans of consignment spinning and weaving, unified purchase and unified sales, the factories are afraid of the shortage of raw materials and are preparing to reduce work. Some of the ordered machines and spindles have been forced to change their unloading in Hong Kong, adding 200,000 spindles to the yarn factory in Hong Kong. In terms of controlling prices and currency, the more you control floating capital, the more it increases, the more you control interest rates, the higher they become, and the more you control prices and wages, the higher they become. In terms of controlling power and fuel, public utilities increase several times a month, the black market for coal is rampant, and coal stocks are piling up in the production areas, but they are restricted by control and cannot be automatically transported and sold, let alone regulated and channeled. There are countless such examples. Since the beginning of last year, the Executive Yuan has changed hands three times, but the control effect is getting worse and worse. We really don't know where their control effectiveness lies? We can't bear to say: under the cover of chanting beautiful slogans of control, to what extent do they want to mess up the national economy and people's lives before they can be considered successful!</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that whenever a control target is identified, a control agency must be set up, and the central department must send its own personnel to set it up in various places, especially in Shanghai, which is more obviously their focus. We don't know what the use of local governments is for the state to set up officials? But leaving aside the local government, we don't know whether these central agencies can really perform their tasks independently? As everyone knows, economic control must be national in scope, that is, it must be implemented across the board. If one place is controlled and another place is not, if they are not closely linked to each other, and if they contradict each other, there will inevitably be many drawbacks and many confusions! Recently, Shanghai strictly inspected warehouses, which seemed to be thunderous, and many food rice were transported to Wuxi, which is a prominent example. However, even if the central agency tries its best to promote it, how can it be established everywhere? If it cannot be set up in a timely manner, how can it promote the whole country and achieve the goal of comprehensive implementation? Let's take the control of finance as an example. Gold and silver shops in various places are operating as usual, but Shanghai is still blindly controlled, and it is not allowed to operate. Also, buying and selling gold notes is said to be illegal, but Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other ports are openly operating. I don't know if there is a Gold Management Bureau there? In many provinces in the interior, silver dollars and copper coins are openly used. In rural areas, food rice is used as wages, rent, and price standards, especially popular in the countryside. Why doesn't the Gold Management Bureau care about such open violations of the state's monetary regulations? Does the Ministry of Finance know? Knowing it and deliberately condoning it, it is really a case of opening one's eyes and closing one's eyes. Then why bother to get energetic in Shanghai and insist that Shanghai have 10,000 or so cunning merchants who are guilty of unforgivable crimes?</p>
<p>In short, to control the economy, we must first establish clear policies, implement overall planning, and carefully adjust the dosage in order to achieve overall promotion. This is the meaning of control. We must never stop and start suddenly, or do things according to our whims, nor should we be incomplete or superficial. In particular, we must not want to suppress and stabilize prices on the one hand, and raise discount rates on the other. The policy is contradictory and cannot be justified. All personnel and appropriation-related actions must be completely eliminated without any personal opinions, and then we can talk about planning and development. As for the implementing agency, the local government should be utilized in advance. If it is not absolutely necessary, it is not appropriate to create new names and set up redundant staff, which will increase the burden on the national treasury. In particular, personnel who enforce control should not talk about control without pure character! It is not yet known whether the Legislative Yuan's proposal to abolish this type of agency will be passed, and it is recommended that the department in charge does not need to panic because of this. Moreover, if the current control is really worthy of being continued, it is not necessarily a necessary condition to maintain the original corrupt and incompetent agency across the board!</p>
<h3>Hainan Island Development Plan; Guangdong's Nine District Commissioner's Offices Have Completed the Draft; Yulin Will Be Built into a Modern Military Port</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Haikou, 20th] It is reported that the development of Hainan Island's resources is imperative. Government officials and American experts have come to Hainan one after another to conduct preliminary investigations. In addition to organizing and studying important data, they have also ordered the nine district commissioner's offices to conduct detailed investigations of various local specialties and draft development plans. The draft plan has now been compiled and printed, and submitted to American aid experts for reference. The content includes iron ore, water conservancy, fishing, salt, sugar, and agriculture. If successful implementation is achieved, the entire Guangdong economic construction problem will also benefit significantly. According to a certain official here, the construction funds for Hainan Island may account for one-fifth of the total U.S. aid construction funds. The plan to build Yulin in the south of the island into a modern military port is also said to be implemented simultaneously. In addition to being able to berth 10,000-ton large warships, its surrounding area is also extremely rich in iron ore, fishing, and salt. The county where it is located, Yaxian, has always been praised as the treasure trove of southern China. In addition to having an airport, it is also the only place on Hainan Island with a railway. Unfortunately, our country's strength has not been able to achieve this quickly. This great and extremely difficult plan depends on the United States to promote it. Recently, it has been rumored that Hainanese merchants in Hong Kong have issued a declaration protesting the United States' use of Hainan Island, which refers to this. According to well-placed sources, Hainan Island urgently needs to be developed, and the protest does not represent public opinion.</p>

After Lang explained in detail that Taiwan's increased production depends entirely on transportation, it was approved that US aid for transportation would focus on the Guangdong-Hankou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Taiwan Railway lines, with the allocation amount determined according to the proportion of the length of the lines. Lang reported to Chairman Wei at 10 o'clock, and Wei expressed his gratification.</p>

<h3>Xiamen Uncovers Arms Case; Appears to be Someone Harboring Leaks</h3>

The three suspects are from Jinjiang and Tongan. The case has now been reported to higher authorities for processing.</p>
<h3>Tang Huisun Returns to Beijing to Discuss Land Reform in North China</h3>
<p>Strengthening Implementation Will Be Effective</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Tang Huisun, Political Deputy of the Ministry of Land Affairs, went to North China for inspection and interviewed Director, General Commander Fu, and exchanged views on land reform. He told reporters: During this inspection in North China, all localities enthusiastically promoted land reform. Shanxi implemented the integration of soldiers and farmers. The goal is "Those who cultivate the land have land to plant." All cultivated land is divided into "portions" by the government and distributed to national soldiers for cultivation. Landlords still retain ownership, but the government controls the distribution rights, so that farmers can obtain the right to use the land. This policy has indeed been thoroughly implemented in Shanxi and has been quite effective. It is worth emulating in other provinces. For the implementation of land reform in the jurisdiction of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, General Commander Chuan has drafted measures, which generally follow the provisions of the Regulations on the Disposal of Land in the Pacification Zone promulgated by the Central Government. A further step is to levy a land price donation, which is levied progressively according to the amount of compensation that should be received based on the area of land requisitioned. I have discussed the implementation measures with General Commander Chuan in detail, and I hope that they can be implemented soon. As for the measures adopted by Commissioner Wang Fenghan of the Tenth District of Hebei, the main purpose is to protect tenant farmers and increase the burden on landlords, so that they give up the land. According to observations in various parts of North China, there is an urgent need to implement land reform. If the local authorities are truly responsible and strengthen implementation, the results will be considerable.</p>

<h3>Temporary School Buildings for Northeastern Universities Have Been Found in Beiping and Tianjin, "July 5th" Investigation Committee to be Established Today</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] The North China剿匪總司令部 (剿匪總司令部 was a military organization tasked with suppressing Communist insurgents) convened a meeting today with the persons in charge of temporary schools for Northeastern universities, with Qin Fengchuan, chairman of the Cultural and Educational Committee, presiding. They discussed issues such as school buildings, student registration, the temporary middle school and temporary university system, and the "July 5th" incident.

The resolved cases are: the temporary middle school in Beiping will be located at Huang Temple, and the temporary middle school in Tianjin will be located at the Yamato School. The cram school will be located at the Tianjin Racecourse. There is still no site for the temporary university. (2) Determine the student status of unregistered schools so that they can be assigned to schools after cram school. The specific instructions from the Ministry of Education are still pending. There are great hidden worries about this issue, as many are demanding unconditional admission. (3) The temporary university system still needs to be considered. Most support the old recommendations of Mr. 維特. (4) The "July 5th" incident should be resolved quickly. (5) National universities do not agree with the Ministry of Education's directive to admit unqualified students. (6) The quota for temporary middle schools is 1,000 people, which is too far from the actual number of 5,000. It should be relaxed. (7) Please transmit a telegram from Fu Zuoyi to the Ministry of Education to help resolve the problem.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Assembly Requests Central Government to Demand Return of "Green Tiger Flag" from Japan, Japanese Officials Say It Was Destroyed by Fire</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] It is reported that the "Green Tiger Flag", which was looted from Taiwan by Japan fifty-three years ago, was destroyed by fire while being stored in the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry. The flag was once the national flag of the Republic of Taiwan, established in 1895 by Chinese patriots who opposed the annexation of Taiwan by the Japanese Empire. They resisted the Japanese invaders for six months before being defeated. The Taiwan Provincial Assembly recently requested the central government to demand the return of the "Green Tiger Flag," which has historical value to Taiwan. However, officials at the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry here doubt that the flag still exists. They believe that the flag was destroyed by fire after Japan surrendered.</p>
<h3>Ships Transporting Grain Leaving Chongqing Must First Report to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Chongqing Pacification Commissioner's Office Formulates Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 20th] The Pacification Commissioner's Office issued measures on the 20th regarding the waterway export of grain: (1) All departing ships, in addition to the necessary food carried by crew members and passengers for a one-way trip from the departure point to the destination, the purser of each ship must strictly restrain all crew members from carrying grain. (2) Each shipping company should submit a list of the food carried by departing ships and the name and quantity of food items carried on behalf of others to the Joint Office of the Sichuan-Yangtze River Shipping Companies in advance, which will then be reported to the Pacification Commissioner's Office for verification and inspection by inspection personnel. If grain is found without a shipping permit or exceeds the quantity listed, the inspection personnel will order it to be unloaded and sold at a low price by the local bureau. The remaining tonnage will be converted to transport military supplies. Also, it is reported that Chongqing has an abundant grain supply, and the people are not lacking in food. The Pacification Commissioner's Office ordered on the 20th that the rice and yellow grain stored in Chongqing by the Grain Department's transportation team be allowed to be shipped out to avoid affecting the military supply.</p>

<h3>Socialist Party Opposes Increasing National Defense Expenditures, French Schuman Cabinet Falls, President Summons Leaders of Various Parties to Discuss Cabinet Formation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The National Assembly passed an amendment proposed by the Socialist Party to reduce the national defense budget by 12 billion francs by a vote of 297 to 214. After a vote of no confidence in the Schuman cabinet, the Schuman cabinet resigned at midnight last night. President Auriol has begun consultations with the leaders of various parties to find a new prime minister. Auriol, according to precedent, first met with Thorez, the leader of the Communist Party, the largest party in the Assembly, and Duclos, the leader of the Communist Party members' group. It is generally believed that this consultation is a formality before forming a cabinet and is not given much importance. It is believed that the Communist Party will not be mandated to form a cabinet, or even re-enter the cabinet. President Auriol is deeply dissatisfied with the Socialist Party's forcing the government to collapse amid international tensions. Before the national defense budget bill was voted on by the National Assembly, seven Socialist cabinet members had already submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Schuman, refusing to compromise on the amendment to reduce national defense spending. It is generally believed that the organization of a new cabinet will be very difficult. The newspaper believes that it will still accommodate members of the Socialist Party, but it is not absolutely impossible to organize a center-right cabinet without accommodating the Socialist Party. Possible candidates for prime minister are Radical Party member Marie, People's Republican Party member Bidault, Minister of Interior Mollet of the Socialist Party, Vice President of the National Assembly Lettrgues, and former Prime Minister Ramadier. Auriol is unlikely to find a suitable prime minister candidate and mandate them to form a cabinet before Wednesday, and the new prime minister must also obtain a vote of confidence from the National Assembly before forming a cabinet, so the formation of the new cabinet will be a week later. Before its establishment, the Schuman cabinet will continue to serve temporarily.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The French cabinet crisis has reached an impasse because President Auriol has failed to find a suitable prime minister candidate. After meeting with the leaders of various parties this morning, Auriol admitted that the prospect of finding a suitable prime minister candidate is still far away. Observers predict that if President Auriol still fails to find someone to form a cabinet within the next 24 hours, he may have to use the mechanism of holding a general election. The main reason for the impasse is that the major parties in parliament have roughly equal strengths, and no party is willing to make appropriate concessions to cooperate in organizing a new middle-of-the-road government. At the same time, General de Gaulle also gave a speech, pointing out that the past government's mismanagement of the country cannot allow incompetent governments to govern again. He also said that the French People's Movement is willing to obtain the power to govern, and such power must be granted by the people. De Gaulle's intention is to demand a general election so that his People's Movement has a chance to win. Some people believe that the appearance of de Gaulle may force the Socialist Party and the Radical Party to agree to make concessions and organize a new coalition cabinet to avoid holding a general election.</p>
<h3>Western European Five-Nation Foreign Ministers Decide to Adopt Delaying Tactics Towards the Soviet Union, Bidault Returns Home Early from The Hague</h3>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 20th] The Western European Union's five-nation foreign ministers meeting today believed that the situation in Germany was extremely serious and decided to adopt delaying tactics towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, The Hague, 20th] The collapse of the French Schuman government was like a wake-up call to the Western European Union meeting. French Foreign Minister Bidault is scheduled to return home tonight, and other foreign ministers agreed to cancel the final formal meeting in the afternoon. The five foreign ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg privately discussed the problems caused by the French political crisis this morning. The French crisis affected the foundation of the main issues discussed, namely the defense of Western Europe. However, a major Western European country actually announced the dissolution of the government because parliament opposed increasing national defense equipment.</p>
<p>It is reported that the United States has warned the five Western European countries that the establishment of the US military aid plan may take several years. The communique of the Western European meeting closing on the 20th will only lightly mention the two important issues of the German issue and US military aid. Regarding the Berlin issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin listened to the other four foreign ministers' calls against a showdown with the Soviet Union. Bidault and the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg especially opposed the bold attempt to use force to open the blockade. They strongly advocated restoring four-power negotiations with all efforts.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 20th] The five foreign ministers of the Western European Union continued the second day, also the last day, of the Western European Union Advisory Committee meeting at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 20th. Foreign Secretary Bevin also held a separate three-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Bidault in advance, which almost reviewed the general international situation. According to the spokesperson of the Advisory Committee meeting, a communique will be issued after the end of this meeting. Although secrecy has been strictly maintained since the start of this meeting, people close to the five-nation delegations said that the atmosphere at the meeting was very harmonious. Good progress has been made in the discussion of the German issue, and an agreement is expected to be reached on the next action to be taken. Some observers also predict that a new note may be submitted to Moscow soon. The Dutch government hosted a banquet for the five-nation delegations in the Trêveszaal Hall of the Dutch Parliament last night.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 20th] Regardless of the collapse of the French cabinet, the five-nation foreign ministers meeting here continued to study various political issues this morning. Economic and social issues will be handed over to a special committee for study, and the committee will draft a bill to be submitted to the plenary session for approval. Bidault plans to draft a European covenant based on the ideal of federalism today, which will include the following two points: (1) Establishing a committee to study the customs union issue of the Brussels Treaty countries; (2) Establishing a European Parliament composed of the parliaments of various countries.</p>
<h3>Stalin Dispatches Doctors to Visit Togliatti</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 19th] It is reported that Stalin has dispatched two Soviet doctors to visit Togliatti's injuries. The Italian Communist Party attaches great importance to Stalin's concern. The trial of the assassin who attacked Togliatti has been announced postponed because Togliatti himself is currently unable to appear in court to testify.</p>
<h3>British MP Suggests Promoting Five-Power Conference, Government Refuses</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] The British government today rejected a suggestion in the House of Commons to seek a five-power conference with China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France to address the urgent international situation and ensure peace. Labor MP Warbey called on Britain to "stand in a position to represent the joint actions of the United Nations organization to maintain international peace and security" and proposed convening a five-power conference. Warbey said that this move is in line with Article 106 of the United Nations Charter. That article stipulates that if the major powers cannot establish an international peacekeeping force in accordance with Article 43 of the Charter, the five powers may conduct consultations. Deputy Foreign Secretary Mayhew replied, "No, sir." He continued, "We do not now need to express our desire for peace, we have not forgotten Article 106 of the Charter, but if we cannot achieve cooperation in Article 43 of the Charter, then invoking Article 106 is superfluous."</p>
<h3>Soviet Bull-Type Fighter Performs Threateningly, British Occupation Authorities File Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] A Soviet Yak fighter plane flew at low altitude over the Gatow airport in the British sector of Berlin yesterday. The British side has formally protested to the Soviets today that this action violates aviation rules.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 19th] A squadron of Soviet "Plow Bull" fighter planes flew here from the Soviet-occupied area today and performed fancy maneuvers at Gatow Airport. According to the British military authorities, the Soviet Command had notified the four-power aviation control station in advance that Soviet planes would fly to Berlin, but did not interfere with the Western countries' airlift operations. There are two reports about the actions of Soviet planes over the British military base. According to the US military authorities, the squadron of Soviet planes totaled twelve, two of which swooped down and quickly rose up, passing "under the belly" of a US C54 transport plane flying there. The Soviet and British airports are only about six miles apart. The British side said that eight to ten Soviet planes "circled" over Gatow Airport first, and then another flew alone next to the US transport plane, but did not make any attacking gestures.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Launches Dual Offensive: Willing to Supply Berlin with Food, U.S. and Britain Expose the Intention and Resolve to Ignore It</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 20th] The Soviet Union today announced that it would supply food to residents of all districts of Berlin, which is a dual offensive against Western countries. Not only does it claim that it can supply all the food for Berlin, but it also intends to make the new Deutsche Mark issued by Western countries worthless and unusable for purchasing food.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 20th] The Soviet Union today adopted new measures to embarrass the Western Allies and force Britain to withdraw from Berlin. The Sokolovsky headquarters has officially announced that it will immediately allocate 100,000 tons of food and fuel ordered from Czechoslovakia and Poland to supply all districts of Berlin. Residents of all districts only need to pay with East German Marks to purchase these rations.</p>
<p>Political figures said that the Soviet Union's move was due to the ineffectiveness of intimidating Berlin residents, so it changed its tactics to lure the people of Berlin to accept Soviet policies with food and fuel as bait. The Western Allies are now facing a difficult problem. It is difficult for them to refuse the Soviet Union's benevolent act of helping the people of Berlin. However, if they accept it, it is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging that Berlin is part of the Soviet Union and is no longer the joint responsibility of the four powers.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 20th] The British government issued a statement stating that the Soviet authorities' willingness to supply food and fuel to the entire city of Berlin is purely for propaganda purposes. The United States and Britain will ignore it and continue to find ways to provide supplies to West Berlin. The statement also said that West Berlin does not lack food. Since the start of the airlift, the food transported has been sufficient for application. If the Soviet Union does not cut off Berlin's transportation, the food supply to the western district is not difficult.</p>
<h3>British, American, and French Military Governors Hold Talks with West German Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 19th] U.S. Military Governor Clay, British Military Governor Robertson, and French Military Governor Koenig held a four-hour meeting at the British Military Headquarters in Berlin today to discuss the general situation in West Germany after the prime ministers of the eleven West German states submitted counter-proposals to the London Conference on West German constitutional politics. Afterwards, Clay announced that the Berlin crisis was never mentioned in the meeting. The three governors are scheduled to meet with the prime ministers of the eleven West German states in Frankfurt on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia Purges Army, Three Senior Generals Flee to Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press Frankfurt, 19th] Well-informed observers predicted on the 19th that the three senior Czech generals who recently fled to Germany will reveal important aspects of the Soviet Union's European strategy. It is generally believed that these three people possess intelligence about the Soviet Union, including Czechoslovakia. These three are General Li Ska, commander-in-chief of the Czech army on the Western Front during World War II, General Van Nieck, former Minister of Defense, and General Hessel, Deputy Chief of Staff. According to military officers who accompanied the three generals to Germany, the Czech army is undergoing a purge since receiving orders from Moscow to accelerate "Sovietization." In addition, (1) Czech Army Chief of Staff Bokok has been dismissed and is under surveillance. (2) Savopolda has become a figurehead. (3) Savopolda's position is succeeded by Slansky (Secretary-General of the Czech Communist Party), who was trained in Moscow. (4) In order to purge "unreliable" officers, officer groups have been disbanded, and military police have been dispatched in serious areas. Communist militias have been organized in various villages and towns. (5) Twelve brigades of police have been stationed on the border, and another 45,000 troops have been transferred to border defense duties.</p>
<h3>American General Pershing Laid to Rest in Arlington with Solemn Ceremony</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 19th] Marshal Pershing's state funeral was held today at Arlington National Cemetery. President Truman personally led generals and soldiers of all ranks from the Army, Navy, and Air Force to the venue to pay their respects. The ceremony was solemn and grand. The commander of the U.S. Army in World War I was laid to rest. The cemetery was covered with lush foliage and surrounded by beautiful tombs, accompanied by his former subordinates from the Philippine and European campaigns. Army chaplain Miller delivered a eulogy, saying, "Another soldier's journey has ended. Pershing was victorious in all battles during his lifetime, and now he rests in peace, awaiting the call." As the coffin was drawn by six gray horses from the Capitol to the cemetery in heavy rain, 500,000 citizens lined the streets to watch, and the procession of pallbearers stretched for a mile.</p>
<h3>South Korean National Assembly Holds Election: Syngman Rhee Elected President, Yi Si-yeong Elected Vice President</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 20th] The South Korean National Assembly held its 33rd meeting today to elect the incumbent president. A total of 197 members attended, with only one absentee. The guest seats and spectator seats were full. Syngman Rhee remained in the speaker's seat and, after announcing the start of the meeting, invited representatives from the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea to report on their work. Voting began at 11 o'clock. Syngman Rhee received 180 votes, an absolute majority.</p>
<p>Kim Gu received 13 votes, Ahn Jae-hong received 2 votes, and one invalid ballot was cast for Dr. Philip Jaisohn because he is an American citizen and therefore considered an invalid ballot. The meeting continued in the afternoon to elect the vice president. In the first round of voting, Yi Si-yeong received 113 votes, Kim Gu received 65 votes, and Cho Man-sik received 11 votes. Because Yi Si-yeong's vote count did not exceed two-thirds, a second round of voting was held. In the second round of voting, Yi received 133 votes and was elected vice president. After being elected, Syngman Rhee told reporters: "Regarding the formation of the cabinet, it must be decided after consultation with the vice president. The prime minister will be decided first, and then the prime minister will appoint the cabinet members."</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops on the North Korean Border</h3>
<p>One U.S. Soldier Killed and One Wounded Among Five</p>
<p>[United Press Seoul, 20th] Five U.S. soldiers were ambushed by a group of Koreans about 400 yards south of the demarcation line between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones near Kaesong on the 19th, resulting in one death and one injury. Occupation headquarters said that the group of Koreans was in U.S. territory and fled into the Soviet occupation zone after the attack, possibly one of the riot groups patrolling into the U.S. occupation zone from North Korea. This attack on U.S. troops is the first since the occupation, although several Koreans have been killed in the past at the demarcation line. A senior U.S. official said that a strongly worded protest would be lodged with the Soviet occupation authorities in Pyongyang, although the Soviet Union has not responded to previous protests regarding border incidents.</p>
<h3>Former Leader of Japan Progressive Party, Ken Inukai, De-Purged</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 20th] An authoritative source told a Central News Agency reporter that Ken Inukai, former leader of the Japan Progressive Party, who was once purged, will now be declared innocent.

<h3>Hong Kong Government Announces New Financial Measures to Prevent Escape of British Pounds</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 20th] The Hong Kong government's Financial Secretary recently notified all approved banks that, effective immediately, remittances between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom exceeding 500 British pounds or its equivalent must obtain the permission of the Hong Kong Exchange Control Bureau. Banks may handle transactions without submitting them to the government for review if they find that the source of funds is indeed reliable for imports and exports, insurance premiums, reasonable travel expenses, bonuses, and interest. These restrictions are intended to prevent the use of Hong Kong's free dollar market to cheaply purchase British pounds or to allow British pound funds to escape to the United States.</p>
<h3>Siam's National Name Still Called Thailand</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Siamese Constitutional Assembly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Bangkok, 20th] The Siamese Constitutional Assembly finally decided to use the word "Thailand" as the national name of Siam.</p>
<h3>Japanese Communist Leader Tokuda Assassinated, Kyushu Island Declares General Strike, Japanese Communist Assemblymen Protest to Government</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 20th] Japanese Communist leaders Nosaka and Hosokawa visited Cabinet Secretary General Tomibechi on the 20th to formally protest to the government regarding the assassination attempt on Tokuda, strongly stating that this action shows that domestic armed reactionaries in Japan still exist.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 20th] Japanese Communist Party leader Sanji Nosaka (Susumu Okano) told Agence France-Presse today that after the bombing attempt on Communist leader Tokuda yesterday, local unions on Kyushu Island have already declared a general strike. Large factories in the Tokyo and Osaka areas have also held protest gatherings.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 20th] Japanese and Allied authorities are taking various precautions to prevent a nationwide disturbance like that in Italy from occurring due to the assassination attempt on Japanese Communist leader Tokuda. However, well-informed sources predict that a general disturbance and reaction will inevitably occur. The Japanese Communist Party has狂呼 "Ashida Cabinet Resign!" Prime Minister Ashida, who is currently traveling and lecturing in southern Honshu, only told the press that "Japan's recovery is 'extremely difficult' when extreme factions exist on both the left and right," indirectly responding to the Japanese Communist Party's accusations. He will obviously support his conservative government. A statement from the Japanese Communist Party stated: "Standing on the side of the laboring masses, we declare a resolute struggle against all reactionary underground organizations."</p>
<p>[United Press Saga, 20th] Koga, a 27-year-old miner who attempted to assassinate Japanese Communist leader Tokuda, told police, "I regret that I failed to kill Tokuda." He also said, "No one ordered me to carry out this task. I did it voluntarily because I firmly believe that the Communist Party is hindering Japan's true democratization. This is also why I joined the Anti-Communist Grand Alliance."</p>
<h3>Rumor that Soviet Tank Tactics Expert Rokossovsky Arrives in Germany, Marshal Sokolovsky Arrives in Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 19th] It is rumored here that Rokossovsky, the youngest marshal-level general in the Soviet Union who is considered the most capable strategist and tank tactics expert, has arrived in Berlin. It is rumored that he will succeed Sokolovsky as the Soviet military commander in Germany or as the commander of the Soviet Western Army. Rokossovsky was released from a Siberian concentration camp and joined the war when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. He is a courageous military strategist but not skilled in political or administrative affairs. His appointment to an important position in Germany indicates that his mission will focus on military affairs. Soviet officials have not yet confirmed the arrival of Rokossovsky in Germany or the rumor that Marshal Sokolovsky will leave office.</p>
<h3>Subtle Relationship Between the United States and Yugoslavia: Two Countries Sign Agreement to Resolve Financial Issues</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 19th] Yugoslavia today resolved a long-standing issue with the United States in the air and on land, as a result of Tito's split with the Cominform. The Yugoslav Minister of Finance rushed from the country's capital to sign an agreement with Marshall stipulating that Yugoslavia will compensate the United States 17 million U.S. dollars for wartime and post-war losses within 45 days, including the losses of two U.S. aircraft shot down in Yugoslav territory two years ago. The United States, on the other hand, agreed to unfreeze Yugoslav gold reserves in the United States that have been frozen since 1942, and 10 million U.S. dollars of Yugoslav private property will also be unfrozen at the same time.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 19th] This move is even more meaningful as it is based on the fact that two conferences will soon be convened in Belgrade. The Yugoslav Communist Congress will be held in the Yugoslav capital on the 21st, and the Danube River Navigation Freedom Conference will be convened in the Yugoslav capital on the 29th, at which time representatives from the United States, France, and Britain will pay attention to how Tito relies on the Moscow front.

<h3>Syria and Iraq Refuse Ceasefire: Fighting Rekindled in North and South of Holy Land, Bernadotte Arrives on Rhodes</h3>

<h3>Shanghai No. 9 Factory 37 Workers Indicted by Special Criminal Court: Yang Guangming and Others Strike and Riot in Violation of the National Mobilization Law, Constituting Crimes Endangering the State</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yang Guangming and 37 other workers from Shanghai No. 9 Factory on Macau Road in this city, on the grounds of demanding salary advances, rations, preferential treatment, etc., without legal mediation by the competent authorities and disregarding government bans, gathered crowds to strike on February 2 this year, committing violence and assaults, attempting to escalate the situation and disrupt public order. After being arrested and interrogated by the Shanghai Police Department, they were sent to the Special Criminal Court for investigation. The court has now completed its investigation and has filed a public prosecution against the detained defendants Yang Guangming, Yang Changmin (Yang Genbao, aka Xiao Genbao), Wang Zhongliang, Mao Helin, Qi Huaiqiong, Wu Baoliang, Shen Shixing, Xu Xingsheng, Peng Zhigong, Miao Xinggen, Wang Xiaodi, Fei Gaogen, Fan Jinnan, Li Dongmei, Song Heming, Deng Zhiyin, Leng Tonggen, Ma Lianzhong, Sun Hanzhao, Wu Shizhen, Zhang Fuda, Gao Baozhu, Xu Diefen, Wu Xiaoma, Chen Qingquan, Wu Achang, Wang Jinsheng, Zhang Xiuying (aka Guan Miaofu), Jiang Yaochen, Xie Shengbao, Tang Chansheng, Wang Meihua, Yin Weijun, Huang Huailian, Xiao Yaqian, Xu Quanfu, and Ding Huijin, on charges of endangering the state.</p>
<p>The indictment states the following facts of the crime: The defendants are all workers at Shanghai No. 9 Factory, No. 140 Macau Road in this city. At a time when suppression of the rebellion is being mobilized, they did not closely cooperate with the factory management. Instead, on January 30 this year, on the grounds of demanding salary advances, rations, preferential treatment, etc., without legal mediation by the competent authorities and disregarding government bans, they openly gathered crowds to strike. Each defendant assumed important positions. In particular, the defendant Yang Guangming secretly joined a Communist Party group with the aim of causing internal strife through the introduction of Guo Chuhuai in 1935, and worked undercover among the factory's coppersmiths.</p>
<p>Inciting the Masses, Declaring a Strike</p>
<p>In January of this year, he introduced the defendant Wu Baoliang to join the Communist Party. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he secretly manipulated the situation. On the one hand, he volunteered, claiming to be the general representative, and went on stage to give speeches, inciting the masses and declaring a strike. The workers then stationed people to guard the four factory gates, preventing any factory employees from entering or leaving. Factory Director Wu Shihua was also detained inside. The defendants Yang Guangming, Wang Zhongliang, Mao Helin, Yang Changmin, Qi Huaiqiong, etc., were elected to present seven conditions to the factory management on February 1: (1) Each person should be given two months' salary as an advance. (2) The salary deducted on November 12 should be reissued according to this month's cost of living index. (3) The annual bonus should be 60% of the previous year's amount, calculated according to the previous year's December index, and the remaining 40% should be issued this year, calculated according to the January index. (4) There should be no restrictions on the number of days of leave for production (wages calculated for seven days, and all welfare rights should be granted). (5) Rations should be reissued as usual. (6) The monthly ration of two斗 of rice and four斗 of rice for office work should be issued as four斗 as usual. (7) In the future, any regulations issued by the factory management to control workers must be agreed upon by both labor and management. The above seven conditions were not submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. When personnel from various agencies went to persuade them to come closer to an agreement, they suddenly added two more conditions: (1) If one day of leave is taken within a week, one day of wages should be compensated. (2) Workers dismissed without cause after January of the previous year should be reinstated. Together with the previous seven conditions, there were a total of nine conditions, making it difficult for the factory management to accept, so as to continue the strike and attempt to expand the scope, affecting various factories, in order to achieve their goal of disrupting local public order.</p>
<p>Holding Good Workers Hostage, Not Allowing Them to Open the Iron Gates</p>
<p>On the one hand, they organized teams for discipline, propaganda, and liaison. The defendant Yang Changmin was appointed as the general commander of the discipline brigade, ordering workers to take on discipline duties, blocking all the factory's main roads, controlling communication equipment, and stopping traffic. Subsequently, they posted slogans attacking the capitalists and insisting on the strike, restricting entry and exit. They controlled more than 6,000 workers, using economics as a slogan to implement a political struggle. The situation was serious and became increasingly intense. In the afternoon of the same day, the factory management reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau, which sent two officials, Zhu, etc., to the factory to persuade them, but they were also detained by the workers and not allowed to leave the factory. When the military police authorities of this city heard about the situation, they believed that the situation was escalating, and on the morning of February 2, they successively selected representatives to come to the factory to seek a solution, but the defendants ordered the workers to tightly close the factory gates, refusing entry. Although they broadcast through loudspeakers, ordering representatives to negotiate, they ignored them. The stalemate continued until around 5 p.m. Some good workers inside the factory requested to leave the factory, but they were also held hostage by the defendants, who did not allow them to open the iron gates. The defendant Qi Huaiqiong composed songs, advocating unity. The defendants Leng Tonggen, Ma Lianzhong, and Sun Hanzhao used performing dramas to incite persistence in the strike. Moreover, on the roof of the dining hall to the left of the factory's third iron gate, workers who were there to support the situation filled the roof with bricks and ironware to resist the military police.</p>

<h3>Cinema Business Depressed: Guild Considers Voluntary Price Reduction</h3>

In order to avoid the consequence of raising ticket prices and causing losses, the guild has decided to investigate and study the actual situation of each cinema to determine whether the audience's purchasing power has decreased or whether the films themselves are not up to standard recently.

<h3>Postponement of Train Schedule Adjustment: Passengers Demand Compensation for Missed Trains</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the Beijing-Shanghai express train has been fully equipped and has undergone short-distance test runs with satisfactory results, the Railway Bureau, as a matter of prudence, plans to conduct another full Beijing-Shanghai test run within the next day or two before deciding on the official launch date. Because the launch date of the express train has been delayed, the new train schedule, which was originally scheduled by the Transportation Department to take effect yesterday (the 20th), has also been postponed. However, since Xie Zhen, who also serves as the Director of the Transportation Department, announced the schedule and its implementation date on the 14th of this month, there has been no news of a postponement. Therefore, yesterday, a passenger named Zhang Zupei sent a letter to the Railway Bureau protesting, attaching clippings from the 15th of this newspaper and two "Victory" train tickets. He stated that after reading the news in this newspaper and confirming with the North Station information desk by telephone, he purchased "Victory" train tickets at the China Travel Service yesterday and went to the North Station to board the train according to the new schedule. Unexpectedly, the "Victory" train still departed according to the old schedule, which was one hour earlier (the old schedule was 7:00 AM, the new schedule was 8:00 AM). Therefore, he demanded compensation for his losses.</p>
<p>Another report: On the day the express train begins service, the prices of sleeping berth tickets on the Beijing-Shanghai night express are also expected to be adjusted on the same day, with upper berths rising to 2.5 million yuan and lower berths to 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in Suzhou Request Express Train to Stop</h3>

In response, various circles in Suzhou jointly sent a letter to the County Council today, requesting that they immediately cable the two Railway Administrations to revise the regulations and have the train stop in Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Relying on Numbers to Commit Violent Assaults Exceeds the Norm of Strikes</h3>
<p>The representatives of the on-site authorities believed that it was difficult to reason with the strikers and decided to cut the iron gate chain to enter and dissuade the workers, and to allow law-abiding workers to escape from the dangerous situation. While the area was being opened, the defendants Shen Shixing, Xu Xingsheng, Peng Zhigong, Miao Xinggen, Fan Jinan, Wang Xiaodi, Fei Gaogen, Li Dongmei, Song Heming, Deng Ziyin, etc., threw iron tools and bricks from high places, used fire hoses to spray water, dragged security officers and police officers standing at the iron gate into the crowd and beat them, preventing them from taking action. Many police officers were injured, the situation deteriorated, and the order was extremely chaotic. The Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters personally witnessed this situation at the factory and believed that the workers were recklessly committing violent assaults, which exceeded the norm of strikes and could not be resolved through reasoning. He had no choice but to order security vehicles to risk entering and suppress the situation, and the workers' arrogance was finally quelled. In the chaos, several police officers and workers were injured or killed. The perpetrators were identified and arrested and transferred to the Shanghai Police Bureau for interrogation before being transferred to the court.</p>
<h3>Legal Articles Constituting Crimes</h3>
<p>The legal articles cited in the indictment for the defendants' crimes: Although the defendants had labor disputes, they did not apply for mediation in accordance with the law and instead openly gathered in crowds to strike.

<h3>Boatman Arrested and Handed Over for Failing to Report Finding Drugs</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Port Management Committee's Investigation and Security Team received a report that a boatman, Wang Youfa, found a coffee-colored iron can on the river surface near Donggou on the afternoon of the 27th of last month. After opening and inspecting it, he discovered that it was top-quality Indian opium, weighing a total of twelve taels and five maces. Wang then concealed the matter without reporting it. It was later learned that the drugs had been thrown from a foreign ship that had sailed from Calcutta to Shanghai on the same day. Before the ship entered port, customs had received intelligence that the ship's crew was smuggling large quantities of opium, so the anti-smuggling unit dispatched a speedboat to monitor the ship, causing the drug smugglers to become nervous and throw the drugs into the river. The Port Management Committee transferred the case to the Municipal Police Bureau for handling. Director Yu approved the case to be thoroughly investigated by Chen Jinsheng, the section chief of the Criminal Investigation Section. Wang Youfa and other suspects, including Zhang Zhenrong, Xia Maomao, Sun Zonghua, and Chen Kouzi, were arrested and interrogated. According to Wang Youfa's confession, he did indeed find twelve taels and five maces of opium on that day, but he recently handed it over to the 3rd Brigade of the Garrison Command, where it was received by Squad Leader Zhao. At the same time, the confessions of the various suspects were also largely consistent. After sending officers to the 3rd Brigade to investigate and confirm that this was indeed the case, Wang, who was charged with concealing the drugs, was transferred to the court for trial, while the other suspects were released on bail.</p>
<h3>Three Police Officers Accused of Bribery in Drug Case</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Shaohua, Wang Pei, and Song Siyan, three plainclothes police officers from the Longhua Sub-Bureau of the Police Bureau, were ordered by the section chief to search the home of Shen Fengkun, the dance hostess manager at the Xianle Ballroom, for drugs. They found a set of drug paraphernalia and a small amount of ash and arrested Shen Fengkun and Shen's wife, Zhong Feifei. Shen then asked Wu Songshan, a friend of Wang Pei, to intercede with the police, and they agreed on a bribe of 1.5 billion yuan to release Shen's wife and conceal the ash. Shen did not have the cash and used four diamond rings as collateral, agreeing to redeem them at Wu Songshan's home at 9 Wangting Road between 8:00 and 9:00 PM on the 13th of this month. On the 12th, Shen redeemed three diamond rings with a gold bracelet and three gold rings, weighing a total of one tael and nine qian and two fen. She was unable to redeem the remaining ring and, feeling resentful, reported the police to the Songshan Sub-Bureau for extortion. The Police Bureau sent officers to wait at Wu's home, and at 5:00 PM on the 15th, the three police officers arrived and were arrested. After investigation, it was determined that Xiang Shaohua and the other two had engaged in extortion, and Wu Songshan's attempt to bribe them had failed. They were transferred to the District Court yesterday for detention and investigation on the charge of corruption under special criminal law.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Rice Ration Coupons Tried and Exposed; Two Rice Shops Not Deceived; Evidence Found in a Shed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Yulin Road Police Sub-Bureau cracked a case of counterfeiting rice ration coupons yesterday, arresting two perpetrators on the spot and seizing 2,000 printed counterfeit coupons. They will be handed over to the district procuratorate along with the evidence after interrogation. The Yulin Rice Shop at No. 492 Yulin Road and the Fu'an Rice Shop at No. 207 Liaoyang Road in the district both reported at around 11 a.m. yesterday that two citizens, Lu A'gen and Zhang Jin'yue, had presented counterfeit rice ration coupons to purchase rice. The shop assistants immediately noticed that the coupons were different from those issued by the Civil Mediation Committee, so they pretended to comply while reporting to the Yulin Police Sub-Bureau. Zhou Weiting, the director of the sub-bureau, sent section chief Rong Yongshao and section member Cheng Wenkuan, along with investigators from the Civil Mediation Committee, to the rice shops, where they arrested Lu and Zhang and seized many unused counterfeit coupons from them. After strict questioning at the sub-bureau, they confessed that the printing press was located in a shed at a certain number in Jiangjia Bang and that their accomplices were Huang Tianyou and Huang You.

<h3>The Iron-Chained Stone Figures are Gone; Incense Burned to See Off the Ignorant</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The pair of stone figures opposite the Racecourse, which were worshiped as deities by the ignorant people, were dismantled yesterday by the Public Works Bureau in conjunction with the Police Bureau and temporarily discarded in Song Park in Zhabei. The dismantling work began at around 8 a.m. The Public Works Bureau sent Ge Deming, the chief of the construction section of the construction office, and eighteen technicians to carry out the work. The Police Bureau sent more than twenty soldiers armed with live ammunition from the New City Sub-Bureau and the Security General Team to guard the area, placing a light machine gun nearby to prevent the ignorant people from interfering. The stone figure on the east side suffered the first misfortune, with a large crack in its lower part. Because its body was made of inferior bluestone, it could not withstand the vibration after being exposed to incense smoke day and night for four or five decades, and it broke apart. The eastern stone figure was lifted off its base at 10:30 a.m., and the western stone figure was not completely dismantled until the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dignity Lost When Suspended in the Air</p>
<p>The dismantling method was as follows: technicians first loosened the base feet, and then erected a horizontal wooden beam between the walls and telephone poles, installing a lifting gear (referred to by technicians as a "celestial winch"). A steel cable was looped around the stone figure's head and neck, and a thick rope was tied around the stone figure's waist, with one end attached to the iron hook of the lifting gear. As the gear turned, the stone figure, weighing more than three tons, began to shake, then was lifted into the air and laid flat on the ground. As this huge object, clangoring with iron chains, swayed in the air, although its form remained the same, its former dignity seemed to have vanished. During the dismantling, the sidewalk in front of the racecourse across the street was crowded with onlookers, and passengers in passing vehicles also craned their necks to look out, significantly affecting traffic. There were still some pious men and women carrying incense, candles, tin foil, and other offerings, but they were stopped by the police. These ignorant people then turned to Xinchang Road and kowtowed and worshiped the wall. Among the onlookers, there was much discussion, with some saying "What a sin!" and others saying "If the stone bodhisattva is effective, the people who dismantle it should immediately get a stomachache!"</p>
<p>Some People Requested Custody, But Were Unsuccessful</p>
<p>After the two stone figures were dismantled, City Councilman Zhang Zhongyuan and the movie "Bad Guy" Hong Jingling suddenly arrived, claiming to have been entrusted by the owner, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to organize a custody committee, requesting that the dismantled stone figures be moved to the Fuxing Pudu Shantang on Yanjiazhai Road, Xibaoxing Road. However, the Public Works Bureau personnel refused the request, stating that they had not received orders from their superiors, and still transported the two stone figures to Song Park. Hong and others argued in vain, claiming that they would negotiate with the municipal government to achieve their goal. Therefore, the future fate of the stone figures is still uncertain. However, last night, in front of the original site of the stone figures, there were still many ignorant men and women who believed that "although the statues are gone, the deities are still there," so they still came to worship the empty space, and the incense was even more abundant than before. Above, there were black characters "Give much peace to beloved China, and grant happiness and prosperity to the people of Shanghai." However, judging from the depth of the stone figures' power over the ignorant, what it grants to China is just a string of troubles for the municipal authorities.</p>

<h3>Grafting and Resurrecting a Corpse: A Major Case in Sichuan's Education Circle; Impersonating a Principal</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 18th via airmail] Strange phenomena are constantly emerging in Sichuan's education circle. Recently, a bizarre drama of a provincial Daxian middle school principal impersonating someone else occurred. The facts have unfolded over several years, with bizarre twists and turns, truly an unprecedented strange situation in the education circle.</p>
<p>The current principal of Daxian Middle School in Sichuan Province, Su Ji (real name Su Peiyuan), was newly appointed by the Director of Education, Ren Juewu, at the end of last year. Su Peiyuan is originally from Fuling, Sichuan, and studied at Fuling County High School. During the War of Resistance, he worked as a clerk in a certain organization in the wartime capital. It so happened that Su Ji, from Guan County, Sichuan, who had studied in France, was working in a neighboring department. Their dormitories were located in adjacent houses. When enemy planes wreaked havoc and air raid alarms were frequent, Su Ji and his wife often went to nearby air raid shelters to hide, and thus often met Su Peiyuan, and they gradually became friendly. On one occasion, enemy planes heavily bombed the city, and a bomb hit the air raid shelter. Su Ji was unfortunately seriously wounded and died for his country. In the chaos, Su Peiyuan unintentionally picked up a leather bag. Upon inspection, he realized it belonged to Su Ji and contained all of his academic and professional credentials, which he cherished and kept for his own use. Later, Su Ji's wife often met Su Peiyuan in the air raid shelter, feeling lonely and lost. Over time, love developed, and they began living together. Peiyuan then told her about picking up the credentials. So, they plotted together for Peiyuan to use Su Ji's name. At the time, Su Ji's wife's father was holding an important position in a certain department. She delicately explained the situation to her father, who reluctantly understood and introduced her to another higher position.</p>
<p>After the victory, Su Ji, through his father-in-law's introduction, became a supervisor in the Ministry of Education and flew to Jinzhou, Shenyang, and other places to inspect. At the end of last year, he returned to Sichuan, carrying a letter of introduction from Minister Zhu Jiayi, and met with Ren Juewu, the Director of Education of Sichuan Province. Due to his qualifications and background, and the fact that he was from the same hometown as Ren (Ren was also from Guan County), he was appointed as the principal of Daxian Middle School in Sichuan Province by Ren. Su claimed to be from Fuling to his fellow townsmen from Fuling, and from Guan County to those from Guan County. This major case is well-known in the education circle. Recently, someone raised the issue during the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, and the Department of Education is thoroughly investigating the truth.</p>

<h3>Wu Jiang's Lake Fields Submerged; Motorboats Rented for Drainage</h3>
<p>Hopes for Saving Rice</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Wuxi, 19th] The Wai Nan Ku of Wujiang, located in Taihu Lake, has been surrounded by more than 9,000 acres of lake fields in recent years. A farm has been established by the Anti-Japanese War Orphans School, and people have been recruited to cultivate it, with Zhao Anmin as the farm manager. During the recent storms, the lake fields were completely submerged, with three to four feet of water accumulated in the fields. More than a thousand farmers are currently raising the dikes. Manager Zhao sent his brother, Anbang, to Wuxi to contact the Wuxi Drainage Industry Association and arrange for it to rent 29 drainage motorboats from Wuxi, Chengxiang, Wujiang, and Yushan counties to carry out rescue operations, specifying that drainage for one hour would cost 2.4 liters of white rice per inch of pipe. In recent days, progress has been seen, and if the weather remains sunny for an extended period, there is still hope for saving the rice.</p>
<h3>Clearing Accumulated Grain in Changzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Wujin, 19th] A total of more than 34,400 stone of accumulated grain were levied from the 35th year in our county, and more than 13,060 stone of accumulated grain were levied from the 36th year, totaling more than 47,000 stone. Except for more than 10,800 stone retained in various rural areas for safekeeping, the Accumulated Grain Storage Association only had more than 500 stone in actual storage, and the remaining approximately 30,000 stone were all in the County Land and Grain Office. The Accumulated Grain Storage Association repeatedly urged for allocation for safekeeping, but during Weng's tenure, there was no response. The County Council specially formed a clearing committee, which has now designated members to conduct thorough investigations. Furthermore, there were many instances of corruption among the officials in charge of land and grain during Weng's tenure. In addition to the major offenders Lu Pinzhen, Shou Xuefan, and Wu Bangxing fleeing, Deputy Director Ding Jun has also absconded, leaving the Land and Grain Office without anyone responsible for handling the handover.</p>
<h3>Jiyuan Theater in Jiaxing Destroyed; Two Soldiers Involved in the Incident Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jiaxing, 19th] At 11:30 p.m. on the 17th, the Jiyuan Yue Opera Theater in our county was destroyed by more than twenty members of the township defense team, who destroyed all of the tickets, scenery, lighting, and other equipment, resulting in a loss of 700 million yuan. The cause was that after the performance began that evening, four members of the Buyun National Guard team purchased three tickets to enter the theater. The ticket collector stopped them because they had purchased one less ticket. A conflict immediately broke out between the two sides. During the fight, there were minor injuries. Yang, the chief inspector of the police bureau, came out to mediate, but to no avail. After the performance ended and the audience dispersed, they proceeded to destroy the theater and fled in all directions. Upon hearing the news, the county magistrate immediately dispatched a platoon of security police to maintain order. The authorities detained two soldiers from the National Guard team responsible for the incident on the 19th. As for the theater's losses, the commander of the regimental district, Commander Lü, and the deputy chief of the National Guard team, Luo, mediated and settled the matter with a compensation of 50 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Strange Insects Discovered in Qianwei; Rice and Wheat All Eaten</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 17th] The Chongshan Forest, covering more than 400 li in the Huangchang and Wangchang towns of Qianwei County, Sichuan, has recently been discovered to have a type of strange yellow-black insect resembling a caterpillar, numbering in the thousands. When first discovered, it ate all the pine needles and bark of the pine forest, spanning more than 200 li, in just a few days. It then began to devour the rice and wheat in several thousand acres of rice paddies in the area. It could not be driven away, and anyone who touched it would immediately develop redness and swelling all over their body. Those severely affected would die overnight. Currently, all the rice and wheat in the area have been eaten. Residents have moved elsewhere to avoid them. The county government has sent a letter to scientific institutions here to study and eliminate them.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Association Urges Prompt Allocation of Cotton to Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin, 19th] The Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Association held its second general membership meeting in Chengxiang on the 12th, stating that since the establishment of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, it had issued an order that each factory's cotton reserves should not exceed three months and that they were not allowed to freely purchase cotton. All raw materials needed by the factories were to be allocated by the committee. Since the factories complied, their cotton reserves were about to be depleted, but the committee did not provide any raw materials. Although the association has a foreign sales committee that exchanges cotton for cloth exported abroad and supplies it to the factories, it is far from meeting the actual needs. At a time when the factories lack raw materials and will be forced to shut down, in addition to applying to the Cotton Yarn Management Committee for prompt allocation of cotton to each factory to maintain operations, if the committee cannot allocate raw materials, the factories will be forced to shut down.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox: Arranging a Marriage Leads to a Great Mistake; Has Been Gone for Thirty Years, Why Still Not Returning?</h3>
<p>Mr. Recipient,</p>
<p>My late brother, Xu Jie, styled Chengjie, dissatisfied with the marriage arranged by his parents, enrolled in the Fine Arts Department of Aurora University around 1920 or 1921. After that, he never returned home. Later, correspondence gradually thinned, and after graduation, his whereabouts became uncertain. My family lives in a remote mountainous area of Guixi, Jiangxi Province, where transportation is difficult, the atmosphere is backward, and banditry is rampant. Years of fleeing made it impossible to actively search for him. Now, my elderly parents are sick with longing for him. I, Chengqiu, have come to Shanghai again, inquiring everywhere. Besides asking Aurora University, his alma mater, to investigate his whereabouts, I respectfully request your esteemed newspaper, the mouthpiece of the people, which provides extensive services to society and benefits the people, and has a good reputation, to publish this letter, so that my elder brother may see the news and return home, or that friends who know him may inform him of his whereabouts and convey the message on my behalf. If my family can be reunited because of this, this kindness and virtue will be engraved in our hearts forever and never forgotten! I respectfully wish you peace.</p>

<h3>The Border Area of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei: The Problem of Filling the Vacuum Zone</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, April 18th] Since the Ministry of National Defense announced the establishment of the "Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu Border Region," under the direct command of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, the defense of southern Shaanxi has been transferred from the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters to the jurisdiction of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters. This is of great significance in preventing Communist bandits from entering Sichuan via the Shaanxi-Hubei border.</p>
<p>In a previous report, "The Border Area of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, the Defense of Dabashan Mountains" (published in this newspaper on April 18th), I detailed the three possible routes the Communist bandits would take to invade Sichuan: (1) from Zhenba in southern Shaanxi, through Gunlongpo, to Wanyuan; (2) from Ziyang, through Dazhu River, to Sichuan; and (3) from western Hubei, through Jixinling, to Wuxi. Since occupying Baihe and Xunyang in southern Shaanxi in April, (Note: Xunyang is now in the hands of the National Army) the bandit troops under Kong Congzhou have never abandoned their attempts to harass Ankang. If Ankang is not defended, it will be difficult for the National Army to resist the invasion of Communist bandits on the edge of Dabashan Mountains. Director Deng Xihou has repeatedly emphasized to this newspaper's reporter: "Defending Dabashan Mountains is not enough to stop the Communist bandits. Strengthening the defenses of Ankang and Hanzhong in southern Shaanxi is the only way to defend against bandits outside Sichuan." He believes that if the Communist bandits attack Wanyuan, Chengkou, and Wuxi along Dabashan Mountains, it will only be harassment. Their main force will definitely try to attack Hanzhong and occupy Guangyuan, because the main purpose of the Communist bandits' invasion of Sichuan is to seize soldiers and grain.</p>
<p>In response to this fact, the "Yiyang" troops, a strong force defending Dabashan Mountains, has departed from its original station to a certain place in southern Shaanxi. Although the "Yiyang" troops are described as "a force that has never fought a war" in the broadcast by Kong Bandit, those familiar with the military situation know that the Kong bandits entrenched in Yunxi and Yun County in northern Hubei, and the Tan Daopeng bandits in Baihe, have already begun to panic. Because the "Yiyang" troops are the only powerful force in the National Army that has not been depleted since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. For years, they have been stationed on the border of Sichuan and Kangding. Southern Sichuan, central Sichuan, and northeastern Sichuan are the pillars of stabilizing the southwest.</p>
<p>The command structure of the National Army on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border has been unified, but the border area of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei is reportedly still a vacuum. For several months, the bandit gangs that fled south from Baihe Ka Shijie to Zhushan and Zhuxi in western Hubei have not been thoroughly suppressed. The stronghold of Deshengpu, which controls Liangzhu (Zhushan and Zhuxi), has been lost and regained several times by the National Army. The most tense period in Zhushan was when the Communist bandits reached Beixing Hetang, only a few tens of miles from the county seat. The 15th Pacification Zone felt the seriousness of the situation and sent Chen Yun, deputy commander of the 8th Security District, to sit in Zhushan County. If the Kong bandits are under pressure from the National Army in the Shaanxi and Hubei area, they will definitely flee to this vacuum zone in western Hubei. How to deploy the defenses of western Hubei and prevent Communist bandits from harassing eastern Sichuan is an important issue facing the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters and the 15th Pacification Zone.</p>

<h3>Authorities Tighten Credit and Sell Off Goods; Prices Decline Across the Board Yesterday; Market Reaction to Large Denomination Notes Improves</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was the second day of the issuance of large denomination notes. Because the relevant authorities were planning to sell off goods, resulting in tight credit and high black market interest rates, prices generally fell back. In the Chinese stock sector, popular stocks such as Yong Yarn, Meyer, and Xinguang, a total of thirteen varieties, plummeted due to widespread selling, all reaching their price limits. Rice, flour, oil, and grains also fell back by about 10% due to tight credit and weak buying interest. Superior rice fell to 36 million, and special superior rice fell back to 39 million. The yarn market was particularly affected by the temporary allocation of resources for the textile industry, with market prices falling by about 20% compared to the previous day. Except for a few commodities such as soap and cigarettes, the prices of daily necessities also slightly decreased. Currently, in order to stabilize the market and offset the impact of the issuance of large denomination notes, the Central Bank has decided to plan a large-scale allocation of daily necessities such as rice, sugar, and yarn to tighten credit and suppress rising prices. Yesterday, the capital inflow of national banks and bureaus exceeded 1.2 trillion. The Central Bank also stated that it currently holds 160,000 bales of cotton yarn, enough sugar for the city's needs for two months. The allocation of 5,000 bales of yarn by the textile industry yesterday could absorb 8 trillion in cash. At the same time, 2,000 boxes of rayon purchased from Italy by the China Industrial and Mining Corporation (Zhongxinju) at a cost of 1.1 million per box arrived on the 18th of this month, and rayon allocation can be resumed next week. Currently, the policy of the financial authorities seems to be to prevent a sharp rise in prices by means of selling off goods, so that it can be connected with the use of US aid in a month and a half.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Intensifies; Massive Stock Sales Lead to Sharp Declines</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday were under planned pressure from national banks, and credit was extremely tight. Even ninety-cent foreign exchange was difficult to obtain. All goods declined, with no exceptions, except for Meilin Liandi, which rose to its limit. Nine out of ten stocks suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>The market still struggled to rally in the morning. Yong Yarn opened at 10,850 yuan, and stocks such as 213, 76, and Guangbang 202 were sold off, resulting in a massive slump. Although there was a slight rebound in the middle, it was of no avail. Stocks such as 60 and 16 were sold down to 10,250 yuan, and stocks such as 193 and 131 rose to 10,400 yuan, but stocks such as 180 and 121 were sold down to the limit of 10,125 yuan. No credit could be obtained. Stocks such as 54 and 134 were sold down to 9,900 yuan, below the limit, and closed. Stocks that fell to their limits included Zhabei, Huafeng, Xinguang, Qinxing, Meyer, Jinglun, and Zhongsi. Except for Meilin Liandi, which rose to its limit, and Tongyi, which remained flat, the rest fell by anywhere from half a percentage point to a strong percentage point.</p>
<p>The afternoon market continued to struggle. Yong Yarn opened high at 10,300 yuan, and stocks such as 12 and 187 rose to 10,650 yuan. After stocks such as 137, 16 and 54 rose, there was selling pressure. It was expected that the capital inflow of national banks would exceed 3 trillion, which would reverse the trend. However, stocks such as 145 and bank stocks 220, 56, and 207 were sold down to 10,250 yuan before the market stabilized. With the capital inflow of national banks exceeding 1 trillion, the situation was uncertain. Yong Yarn closed at 10,400 yuan, with the after-hours bid dropping to 10,350 yuan or lower. Compared to the morning close, Meilin still stood at the limit, Tongyi was still flat, Yong Yarn, Meyer, Xinhe, Qinxing, Lianan, Zhongsi, Commercial Press, Xinhua, all rose slightly. Hengfeng, Jingfu, Xinguang, Rongfeng, Underwear, Jinglun, Yonggong, Lianan, Guohuo, and Zhongfa all rose by half a percentage point. The unlisted stocks outside the market were more sluggish, with cultural textile stocks falling slightly by half a percentage point. The rest remained mediocre.</p>
<p>Government bonds also turned down yesterday. Unification C opened at 1.12 million in the morning and fell to 1 million before stabilizing slightly. Over 4 million were traded. Compared to the previous close, A and B bonds fell by 60,000 yuan, C bonds fell by 90,000 yuan, D bonds fell by 70,000 yuan, and E bonds fell by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Product Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to tea industry insiders, since the issuance of large denomination notes, the tea market in this city has once been stirred up, but it has turned peaceful due to tight credit. Currently, it has affected tea merchants in the producing areas. The asking prices are reported to be soaring, almost on par with tea prices in this city. If freight and all other fees are added, it is feared that it will exceed the market conditions in Shanghai. Therefore, the sources are gradually becoming sluggish. Looking at this situation, the industry in this city will likely follow suit and gradually increase prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: Although sellers tried to push prices higher, buyers were also bearish due to the downturn in various commodities. Therefore, they watched and waited, and the process was powerless to rise. In the end, the market remained stable, and trading was not active.</p>
<h3>Rayon Plummets</h3>
<p>The rayon market experienced a severe downturn yesterday, with a loss of over 400 million yuan compared to the previous day. No. 120, Jin Sanma, and Youguang had a transaction of 1.16 billion yuan per box at the opening in the morning. However, due to oversupply, prices fell steadily. The minimum spot price fell to 1.8 billion yuan. It improved slightly at the close, with an asking price of 1.9 billion yuan. Due to tight credit, the maximum profit for the day was 180 million yuan, and the initial profit was 160 million yuan. The asking price opened at 2 billion yuan in the afternoon, once rising to 2.05 billion yuan, but falling to 1.9 billion yuan at the close. Finally, the after-hours price fell to 1.86 billion yuan, resulting in a decrease of 450 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory-made yarn prices also plummeted yesterday, and trading was extremely scarce. Due to very tight credit, buyers were unable to purchase. A small amount of high-grade zero-waste was sold at 1.1 billion yuan, but the loan had a term of three or four days. There were no transactions at other levels. The asking price was about 300 million yuan lower than the previous day. The market for dried silk also declined accordingly yesterday.</p>
<h3>2,000 Boxes of Italian Rayon Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Approximately 2,000 boxes of rayon purchased by the China Industrial and Mining Corporation (Zhongxinju) from Italy have been shipped to Shanghai and are currently undergoing customs clearance and unloading procedures. Allocation will begin in early next month. It is reported that the China Industrial and Mining Corporation purchased a large quantity of rayon from Italy and will ship it to Shanghai in batches.</p>
<h3>China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) South China Branch Ordered to Close</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The CNRRA recently received an order from the Executive Yuan to immediately abolish the South China Branch. The branch has actively handled the closure after receiving the order. In addition, Tian Ding'an, deputy director of the CNRRA South China Branch and director of the Guangzhou Office, resigned and was approved. The vacancy was filled by Xu Zhennan, director of the CNRRA Visa Office. Xu will go to Guangzhou to take office soon, and the Visa Office affairs will be temporarily handled by Shi Deqian, deputy director of the office.</p>
<h3>Coal Slurry Exchanged for Pit Props</h3>
<p>China Industrial and Mining Corporation (Zhongxinju) Implements Barter Trade with Japan</p>
<p>The China Industrial and Mining Corporation previously responded to the request of various coal mines to exchange coal slurry for Japanese pit props. It is now known that all of the bureau's 361,000 pit props were transported to the Kai Lu Coal Mine a few days ago. The first batch, 73,500 props, was shipped on July 11 by the Zhongyuan Company's Liangxin, and has arrived in Qinhuangdao. The second batch, approximately 82,000 props, was also shipped on the 19th of this month by the Zhongyuan Company's Huali. The remaining number can also be shipped one after another, in order to increase the mine's coal production.</p>
<h3>Long Positions Eager to Sell, Market Sentiment Fearful; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market: Due to the large-scale sell-off by the Yarn Control Committee the previous day, the market felt the pressure of tight credit as soon as it opened. Long positions were eager to sell, and the market was full of supply. The buying interest was sluggish. The market atmosphere was further weakened by the sharp decline in cloth prices and stock prices.</p>
<p>42-count blue phoenix fine yarn was initially quoted at 1.65 billion yuan, but immediately fell by 170 million yuan. It once rebounded to 1.7 billion yuan in the middle. However, at 11:30, the Textile Building Company suddenly announced the sale of five types, including 20-count Jincheng, at low prices. The market was oversupplied and ended at 1.55 billion, a further decline of 270 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of fine yarn and cloth also declined frequently due to long positions selling at a loss, with a strong selling atmosphere. The prices mostly fell by 120 million to 340 million yuan. A total of 72 transactions were made throughout the day.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth market: After the issuance of large denomination notes, the authorities immediately sold off a large amount of materials in order to tighten the currency and prevent speculation. Yesterday, the Textile Building Company tendered for 12 types, including Wufu fine cloth and drill blanks. The Flower Control Committee also made special allocations of Shuangyu and Football fine cloth again. Industry insiders suffered from tight credit and were forced to sell. Market sentiment was therefore fearful, and there was a strong selling atmosphere in the market.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell by 4 million yuan as soon as the market opened. Due to oversupply, it finally closed at 44 million yuan, a sharp decline of 9 million yuan compared to the previous day. There were transactions at 1 million yuan lower after the close, and the after-hours price fell by 6 million yuan. Other drill fine twill and coarse cloth also declined sharply.</p>
<p>In addition: Zhongfang sold 681 pieces of yarn on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee yesterday, totaling 702 billion yuan. Zhongfang also sold 13,900 pieces of cotton cloth and 420 quilts, totaling 64,564 million yuan. The 19th cotton tender totaled 30,586,600 million yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Market Downstream; Flour, Grains, and Cooking Oil See Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was downstream due to the impact of tightening credit. In addition, with the decline in various commodities outside the industry, market sentiment was naturally weak, and buying interest was weak. The morning market fell by 1 million, and the afternoon market fell by another 1 million, for a total decrease of 2 million yuan. White short-grain rice went from 37 million to 36 million, and special high-grade short-grain rice was quoted at 39 million. Baiyuan also opened at 36 million. Coarse short-grain rice for factory use was traded at 34 million. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 4,464 shi in the north and south markets.</p>
<p>Flour declined rapidly. Due to the tight credit, holders were willing to sell at low prices, and the market turned sharply downward. The old car opened at 11.7 million and gradually declined to 10.5 million at the close. Bingchuan closed at 10 million. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and all fell below the 10 million mark, each falling sharply by 3 million yuan compared to the previous day. Bran retreated to the 8 million mark, and small bags of bran were 6.25 million in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains rebounded and fell back. Due to tight credit, holders were eager to liquidate, and the supply suddenly increased. Prices declined across the board. Hankou Mung Beans closed at 15.1 million, a sharp decline of 3.9 million. Corn and Yuan Wheat mostly had returned transactions the previous day and fell sharply by 5 to 6 million yesterday. Broad beans and green beans fell by 3 million together. Sesame fell by 3 million. Raw peanut kernels had many plate auctions the previous day and fell sharply by 8 million.</p>
<p>Cooking oil retreated sharply. Due to tight credit, retail investors returned to the market to sell, and oil factories continued to sell, resulting in an ample supply. Dayou soybean oil initially opened at 75 million and closed at 73 million. Minsheng vegetable oil was at 66 million, each declining by 7 to 8 million to 10 million yuan. Jittong raw oil retreated by 5 million and was traded at 100 million yuan. Only Xiaoche Sesame oil stood firm at the original price due to Tianjin merchants' procurement.

The middle school part uses a three-three system, with special emphasis on skills training, such as music, art, manual labor, physical education, etc., to facilitate employment. For higher education, in addition to talented students entering five-year vocational schools, a national special education normal school will be established under the Ministry of Education, and a special education department will be established in universities. This special normal school may be attached to schools for the blind and deaf-mute as demonstrations for various regions. The number of students per class in blind schools shall be six to twelve.</p>

<h3>Approval to Open Private Schools: Request for Rice Allocation Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The special price rice allocation for employees of private primary and secondary schools in this city is limited to private schools that have been formally registered, according to Article 37 of the "Shanghai Municipal Rice Allocation Implementation Rules". However, when private primary schools were first allocated rice, the Civil Food Allocation Office and the Education Bureau, in order to show consideration for the low salaries and difficult lives of private school teachers, relaxed the standards and allowed all schools that had been "approved to open" to be allocated rice. This principle was followed in May and June. Now, the Education Bureau has again submitted it to Mayor Wu for approval, and the rice allocation for July will still be handled according to the methods and number of people in May and June.</p>

<h3>Dunhuang Painters are Busy Copying: The Thousand Buddha Caves Exhibition Hall Will Be Completed Soon; Chang Shuhong Returns to Beijing to Discuss Public Exhibition</h3>
<p>[Our Yumen Reporter Song Lin, 19th] Today, the Thousand Buddha Caves, after several years of renovation by the National Dunhuang Research Institute, is no longer as desolate as it used to be. New caves have been discovered one after another, reaching 470 caves. In front of the caves, green willows are sprouting, and clear streams are gurgling. The "Lingyin Road" has a "Exhibition Hall" built this spring, which will be completed soon. The hall plaque is inlaid with elegant Tang brick relief patterns. The interior is Western-style, spacious and bright. Each cave is marked with a heavy number indicating the cave entrance (P, C, old numbers are listed side by side). For days, sweeping the quicksand, more than ten men and women from the research institute have been lurking in the black caves, copying murals. From the ancient grottoes, English and French songs fly out from time to time. The reporter and Duan Tiren, an assistant researcher at the institute, chatted about the art of the Mogao Grottoes. According to Yuan, "The institute has copied more than 3,000 murals from various dynasties. Director Chang Shuhong flew to Beijing the week before to discuss with the Ministry of Education the public exhibition at home and abroad, and plans to collect famous Chinese paintings from ancient and modern times to bring back for display, so as to make a comparative study with Dunhuang art. Chang's daughter, Sana, flew to Beijing with her father and is about to go to the United States to study painting. The institute has compiled the "Mogao Grottoes Atlas" and intends to print it in the United States due to difficulties in color printing. The institute now donates 50 copies of rubbings of Mogao Grottoes inscriptions every month to Dunhuang County Middle School, worth 25 million yuan, all as educational funds.</p>

<h3>Four Private Medical and Pharmaceutical Vocational Schools: Tongde Medical College</h3>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The college was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China and renamed to its current name in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the school buildings were built on Xiangyin Road (now called Weidemei Road). During the war, part of the school buildings were destroyed, so classes were held in the affiliated hospital on North Zhongzheng 1st Road. Currently, it is trying to recover the original school buildings in Jiangwan for future resumption.</p>
<p>The college's trustees are Mr. Shao Lizi, Mr. Wu Zhihui, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai. The principal is Gu Yuqi, and there are a total of 67 faculty and staff members and 506 students. In terms of equipment, it has been relatively enriched by the receipt of post-war relief materials and the self-funded additions in recent years.</p>
<p>Enrollment</p>
<p>The college's first enrollment date is July 24th, and registration starts immediately and ends on the 22nd. The number of students to be enrolled is 50 freshmen in the first grade and transfer students in the second grade.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Dental Vocational School</h3>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The school is located at No. 40 Fuxing West Road (ie Bai Xiangzhong Road) and was opened by dentist Situ Bo after being approved by the Ministry of Education in July of the 35th year. There are currently 37 students in the first grade and 18 students in the second grade. The current school address is originally Principal Situ's private residence. Because the houses are not enough for use, it is planned to build a new school building on the base of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College in Jiangwan. In addition, the honorary trustees of the school are Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, and other nine people, the chairman of the board is Pan Gongzhan, and the trustees are Wu Yun, Chu, Diao Xinde, Li Handuo, and other nine people.</p>
<p>Enrollment</p>
<p>The school's study period is four years (including one year of clinical practice). This year, 50 freshmen will be enrolled in the first grade, and 10 backup students will be enrolled. Both men and women are accepted. Those with a high school diploma are eligible to apply. Registration dates are July 15th to 24th for the first time, and August 6th to 15th for the second time. The exam dates will be notified at the time of registration.</p>
<h3>Sino-French Pharmaceutical Vocational School</h3>
<p>In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, and Song Wusheng, in order to promote pharmaceutical education and provide talents for China's pharmaceutical industry, obtained the sponsorship of the pharmaceutical industry and the new pharmaceutical industry in Shanghai, and then established a school of pharmacy affiliated to Sino-French University. The French ambassador to China designated No. 410 South Shaanxi Road as the school address. In that year, the application was approved and enrollment began. Later, due to the restrictions of the Ministry's regulations, the school of pharmacy was renamed "Sino-French University Pharmaceutical Vocational School", and the registration procedures were formally completed in the 21st year.</p>
<p>The school's teaching has always been known for its strictness. Up to now, there have been 14 graduates, but the total number is only 204, which shows the seriousness of its teaching. Among these 14 graduates, 74 are working in pharmaceutical factories, 40 are engaged in pharmaceutical administration, and the rest are distributed in major hospitals, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical education institutions, and none of them are unemployed. The school's study period is four years, and all courses are required courses. In addition to pharmaceutical law, materia medica, and English, there are also experiments, and experiments must be tested, so the actual curriculum is more burdensome than ordinary schools.</p>
<p>The school's annual expenses are paid monthly by Sino-French University, and instruments and specimens are donated by various factories. Before the war, the Ministry of Education subsidized the school with research funds, and the Guangxi Provincial Government also entrusted the school to train pharmacists at public expense. The government has also entrusted the school's professors to handle the compilation of the pharmacopoeia, the revision and review of pharmaceutical laws, the examination of pharmaceutical personnel, and the compilation of pharmaceutical curricula. The school has also published books such as Pharmaceutical Analysis Methods, Pharmaceutical Experiment Methods, and Toxicology Analysis Methods.</p>
<p>Enrollment</p>
<p>The school will enroll about 40 new students this year. Candidates must pay attention to English, biology, and chemistry. Because the school recently investigated that the students' grades in chemistry were the worst, and biology and English were not ideal, the standards of these subjects will be slightly raised in the entrance examination.</p>
<h3>Southeast Medical College</h3>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The school was founded in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The original school address was in Zhenru. It was damaged during the Anti-Japanese War and moved to Sapo Sai Road.

The school is a six-year system, and there are currently more than 400 students in grades one to six.</p>

<h3>The Authority on 1500 Meters: World Record Holder, Sweden's Gunder Hägg's Success Story, One of the Highest Ranked Champions in the World Games</h3>
<p>[London Correspondence from the British News Agency] Even if Sweden's lightning-fast miler Gunder Hägg never achieves the impossible feat of "running with the hare and hunting with the hounds," he has certainly progressed from being the "hare" to becoming the pursuer. His performance while pacing with Arne Andersson showcased his potential to Sweden and the world for the first time.</p>
<p>He joined the athletic club in Malmö at the age of twenty, already renowned for his dexterity.</p>
<p>Hägg originally worked as a typesetter at a newspaper in Malmö. He was also a skilled pianist and had given a modern music concert in the Swedish capital a year prior. The newspaper later transferred him to the sports department, where he now has his own sports column.</p>
<p>Hägg initially focused on the half-mile, but experts soon recognized that this slender pianist was better suited for the 1500 meters. Hägg had moved to Malmö and joined the athletic club at that time. As he and Hägg practiced together in the woods outside the city, those in the know began to say that this newcomer could one day become a great racer.</p>
<p>Hägg trained his "hare." Another famous Swedish one-mile runner, Arne Andersson, also played a part. These two men paced with Hägg several times, resulting in world records, missing the "dream mile" (four minutes) by only one second. Hägg's best time in 1944 was three minutes and fifty-five seconds for 1500 meters.</p>
<p>Within a season, he had leaped into the ranks of world-class athletes. In his first race of the following year, he ran the 1500 meters in three minutes and forty-seven seconds, breaking Jack Lovelock's world record but finishing second to Andersson.</p>
<p>While Hägg and Hägg continued to train together, preparing to break the four-minute mile record, the former "hare" suddenly found himself alone and without companions. Hägg and Andersson were both temporarily banned from competition and soon declared non-amateurs.</p>
<p>Hägg had gone to the United States to compete a few years earlier, and now Hägg also went, becoming the American champion. After returning to Europe, he won the European Championship in Oslo in 1946.</p>
<p>On July 18 of last year, he ran the 1500 meters in three minutes and forty-three seconds, precisely tying Hägg's world record. Neither he nor the second-place finisher, Lennart Strand, knew how they had run so fast. Hägg himself commented after the race: "We should be able to run a mile in under four minutes easily." After winning the Swedish Championship, Hägg was planning to take a short break but accepted an invitation to compete in Paris. Unexpectedly, he suffered his first defeat in two years, with Marcel Hansenne winning and Hägg finishing fifth.</p>
<p>Between Hägg and a gold medal at the World Games, there is only one obstacle: his nervousness. Before any race, even if his opponents are second-rate athletes, he is extremely anxious, like an actor making his debut. Once, he went to the starting line without wearing his vest. His friends worry that he might one day go to the starting line completely naked. (Note: Hägg holds the world record for the 1500 meters at three minutes and forty-three seconds and is one of the highest ranked champions in this year's World Games.)</p>

<h3>Brakes are Essential</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>In Shanghai, whenever people see rickshaw pullers fall, causing passengers to fall out, it is customary for everyone to gather around and laugh, never offering a helping hand. Sometimes, they even call it "fishing." If the passenger who falls is a young woman, the onlookers are especially delighted and will shout out vulgar remarks to show their wit.</p>
<p>If it is not a rickshaw but a pedicab that falls, there is also a kind of "witty" remark, called "dumping garbage." Thinking carefully about it, one has to admire the people who come up with these phrases—admiring them for always maintaining the world's most boring and cowardly record with such ease!</p>
<p>In all fairness, the roads in Shanghai are generally smooth. Although pedicabs often bump into the back of the vehicle in front of them when traffic is extremely congested, causing the person sitting in the front vehicle to feel as if they have been punched in the middle of their back, the flipping over of the vehicle, which is called "dumping garbage," is actually not very common. However, "not very common" does not mean "impossible." If you often take a pedicab from Hongkou across the bridge to the central district, you will feel the existence of this "possibility."</p>
<p>When taking a pedicab across the bridge, the puller jumps down as soon as he reaches the bridgehead, leaning his body and pulling the pedicab up the bridge. The way he takes each step slowly and steadily is just like the boat trackers commonly seen in the water towns of Jiangnan. If it has just rained, the bridgehead is covered in wet, shimmering water, making it even more difficult to walk. If he slips, the passenger will inevitably taste "garbage" amid the laughter of the crowd. After much hard work, the pedicab puller seems to breathe a sigh of relief when he finally reaches the middle of the bridge.</p>
<p>However, although the pedicab puller has "relieved his burden," the passenger absolutely cannot "feel at ease." Going down the bridge is actually more dangerous than going up. When going up the bridge, there are sometimes ragged children who give you a push, saving the puller a lot of effort. Moreover, because it is slow and steady, any danger can be stopped in time, so it is not easy to have any major problems. Going down the bridge is quite different: the puller leaps onto the vehicle and rushes straight down the bridge with lightning speed. Although he constantly makes warning shouts, the thrilling scenes are truly endless. Rushing down too fast can easily result in a head-on collision with an oncoming car or pedicab. If the handcart or rubber-wheeled cart walking slowly in front does not yield, it is especially easy to cause a terrible disaster. If you go too slowly, the pedicab rushing down behind you will follow closely. If you are slow and he is fast, the result will still be a collision.</p>
<p>At this time, the key to turning danger into safety depends half on the skill of the pedicab puller and half on whether the pedicab's "brakes" are effective. If the "brakes" are effective, the horse on the precipice can be reined in, and the safety of the passenger can be ensured; otherwise—there is no need to say any more.</p>
<p>Having said this, it is time to get to the main point. Riding a pedicab is just a metaphor.</p>
<p>Large banknotes have been issued. Large banknotes are needed. A few days ago, my wife wanted to prepare some winter clothes for the children, and as a result, she went to the street with a large bag of banknotes. It was both troublesome and unsightly. After buying the goods, she had to wait for the shop assistant to count the banknotes, watching him count stack after stack with impatience. For the sake of morality, she still insisted that he finish counting before leaving. The volume of a wool sweater is only one-tenth of the volume of the banknotes used to buy it. Although she felt relaxed when she came back, she could not help but feel a sense of nostalgia, thinking of the days when rice was sold for only ten yuan per dan (unit of dry measure). With this sense of nostalgia, I naturally thought of whether "future generations will look at the present as we look at the past." The government officials ride in new cars, so they certainly do not know why pedicabs "dump garbage," but the "brakes" of cars are also very important. If the "brakes" are not effective, perhaps the officials with full bellies of knowledge will be frightened. If things go wrong, our troubled country may lose an important official who was finally "approved," which would be troublesome, wouldn't it? Therefore, I say: Brakes are essential—</p>
<p>One banknote is five million yuan, with six zeros after the "five"! If you don't brake, watch out for "garbage"!</p>
<h3>Sunglasses</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The United States recently held a "Pan-American Ophthalmology Conference." Dr. Matthew from Texas presented a paper on sunglasses. He said that constantly wearing dark sunglasses can lead to a habit of needing to wear them. Whenever the light is too bright, you will feel uncomfortable without sunglasses. However, if you choose sunglasses with lighter colors, there is no harm. He specifically stated that anyone who thinks that wearing sunglasses allows them to look directly at the sun is sure to suffer. Even the best sunglasses will cause eye damage if you wear them and look at the sun, and sometimes this damage is very serious. Scientists must use specially made glasses to observe the sun and must never use sunglasses as a substitute.</p>
<h3>Concert in Memory of Nie Er's Death Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Zhiwei</p>
<p>July 17th is the death anniversary of the late musician Nie Er. In today's music scene, which is gradually fading, even in Shanghai, where talent is relatively concentrated, there is no news of any memorial concert. Only the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association held a large-scale music and dance performance on the afternoon of the 16th, which can be considered an embellishment for the death anniversary of a generation of musicians.</p>
<p>That day, the weather was quite hot. The more than four hundred seats in the Youth Association's auditorium were already full before seven o'clock, but friends who loved music and dance continued to pour in. Many audience members had to stand, totaling no less than one thousand two hundred people.</p>
<p>The first performance was a choir performance by the association's first student choir, featuring songs such as the Suiyuan folk song "Horse Racing on the City Wall" arranged by Tian Er. The singing was melodious, giving people a sense of being in a remote and desolate border area, without losing the essence of folk songs. The second performance was Wang Fukang's baritone solo, "Homesickness Song," "Putting a Flower in Front of the Window," etc. Other performances, such as the soprano solos by Wang Zhixiang and Yang Anzhen's daughter, were also wonderful. All three dance performances were costumed, wearing frontier folk costumes. "Mountain Wasteland" was the most lively, with colorful costumes and exotic dances, winning the audience's praise. After the dance, the applause was endless, and they wanted to continue. The final performance was a one-hundred-person chorus, with a grand scene, and because the stage was not big enough to accommodate everyone, they were lined up to the bottom of the stage. They sang Nie Er's posthumous works, "The Big Road Song," "March of the Volunteers," and "Work Hard," which was popular in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War, and "Eight Years Since the Victory of the Anti-Japanese War." The singing was loud and majestic, and the accompaniment with drums, gongs, and cymbals was even more unique, inspiring and uplifting.</p>
<p>The meeting ended at ten o'clock. I deeply felt that in today's Shanghai, where movie ticket prices have soared to 400,000 and decadent music pervades the entire city, public school teachers with clean sleeves and pure young people who are unwilling to drift along with the tide really lack proper entertainment to regulate their spirits. Music and dance performances like this are really worth promoting.</p>
<h3>The Painter's Eccentricities</h3>
<p>— Shuichan</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all kinds of "masters" have some eccentricities, especially calligraphers and painters. For example, Mr. You Han of Lingui—Wei Qi—has eccentricities. You Han has been selling paintings in Shanghai for many years, and everyone who has met him finds him amiable and approachable, which is definitely true. But when he is painting, it is not the same. He has painted so many paintings, and according to him, no two layouts are the same. Indeed, I have never seen two of his paintings that are the same. This certainly shows that he has boundless ideas in his mind, but he never picks up his brush unless he is inspired. Therefore, you see him chatting, smoking, and relaxing all day long, as if he has nothing to do. When inspiration suddenly comes, he puts everything down, sits upright, and wields his brush like lightning. Any friends who are "sensible" should quietly withdraw and not disturb his poetic mood, otherwise, there is a risk of being "scolded to your face." Fortunately, he always paints when it is late at night and quiet, so he will not offend "honored guests." A few old friends who know his temper well have already run away. In any case, he always paints seriously, with the idea of enduring for a thousand years.</p>
<p>His fees are not too expensive, but when he is happy, he will paint several pieces at once, and when he is not happy, he will not lightly put down a single stroke. He is most afraid of getting a haircut. He says that he will get sick for three days after getting a haircut, and nothing will go well. If you ask him to write calligraphy right after he gets a haircut, then you are "out of luck." Fortunately, he only gets a haircut three or four times a year, and strangely enough, his hair does not grow too long. If you want him to paint, it is best to look at the length of his hair. The longer it is, the more energetic he is, and the better he paints. One more thing, if you want him to paint quickly and well, you must have his wife urge him. Speaking of his wife, she is the famous doctor, Qian Taixi's daughter, Bo Xue and versatile. He often recites a line from Liu Yongtian's poem, called "Besides, there are crazy friends and strange companions." The word "besides" is used as a verb, referring to his surname, "strange companions" refers to his wife, and "crazy friends" is also a great calligrapher, Chen Mengjie—Yun Zhang. Originally, You Han's father was Mr. Kuang Zhoufeng—one of the four great lyricists of the late Qing Dynasty—he must have heard this line from Liu's poem since he was a child, so he quoted it appropriately. Probably without these two "crazy friends and strange companions," he would not be able to get his painting mood up. Once, I wanted to ask him to paint a fan surface, and I wanted it to be quick and good, so I changed my strategy, first visited his "crazy friend," wrote a passage of small regular script, and sent it over when he was not at home. His "strange companion" accepted it. Sure enough, in the evening, he personally brought the painted fan surface, needless to say, it was quick and good. The "crazy friend" gave him an eight-character evaluation: "It is able to create new ideas without deviating from the correct principles."</p>
<p>Mark Twain's Humor -- Mou Dunpei</p>
<p>Once, the master of humor, Mark Twain, found that there were two other people in his room on the train, one was a vice-pastor, and the other was a goods salesman. At this time, Mark Twain felt extremely tired and wanted to take a nap, but the salesman repeatedly talked loudly to the patient pastor, leisurely and contentedly, without any fatigue.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was so anxious that he had no choice but to walk over and say to them: "Let me ask you a question. Do you know what is the difference between a stupid person and a vice-pastor?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," the vice-pastor blurted out.</p>
<p>"I know," the salesman said triumphantly: "A pastor wears his cross on his chest, while a stupid person wears his cross on his back."</p>
<p>Mark Twain suddenly stood up and stared at him very sternly and said: "Do you know what is the difference between a donkey and a traveling salesman?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," the salesman replied.</p>
<p>"I don't know either!" After Mark Twain solemnly finished speaking, he quickly went back to sleep.</p>
<p>At this time, the vice-pastor and the salesman were puzzled by each other's questions, and they never talked loudly again. Mark Twain fell asleep peacefully.</p>
<h3>Poor Service</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>A man went to a thriving restaurant in Chicago for breakfast. After the waitress handed him coffee and toast, she did not bring him the orange juice he ordered until ten minutes later. The man expressed considerable dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The waitress asked: "Are you married?" The man said: "Yes—what's it to you?" The waitress said: "Well, why don't you eat breakfast at home?"</p>
<p>Once, the movie actor Victor McLaglen, on his way from his residence to Hollywood, stopped at a chicken shop set up by the roadside to eat. He waited for three-quarters of an hour before the waiter slowly placed the half spring chicken he ordered in front of him. McLaglen questioned him as to why it had taken so long. He replied: "We have to wait for another customer to order the same half spring chicken before we can kill the chicken and then prepare it together."</p>
<p>A customer was eating scallion pancakes in a snack shop in Santa Monica, California. He only took two bites before the waitress took his plate away and wiped the counter with a cloth. This person said: "Hey, I only ate two bites!"</p>
<p>The woman didn't even bat an eye, took out another whole scallion pancake, took two bites, and put the leftovers in the customer's plate.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Because of the general lack of awareness of the "election of queens" (such as school queens, city queens, national university queens, etc.), I briefly discussed the different interpretations of "queen" and Queen, and the errors of childish imitation of European customs. Now I associate it with the so-called "senior male actor king" and "female role king" in the acting world. This probably originated from the "Tan fans" praising Tan Xinpei (that is, Di Chu Lao Gengzi, who said "Who cares about the country's rise and fall, the whole city is fighting to say the calling of heaven," and also said "Little Calling Heaven"). During the late Qing Dynasty, he was called "Tan Baylor" because the Qing Dynasty had not yet fallen at that time, and the Manchu noble titles were talked about by the general corrupt people. "Baylor" is a Qing word, also a kind of royal title. When Tan Xinpei went to Shanghai during the Republic of China, the Manchu style had lost its luck and was out of date, and the foreign style names replaced it. The signs of "Kerosene King", "Car King", "Circus King", and "Rubber King" were all over the place, so "Baylor" was replaced by the new "King", from the banner flavor to the foreign flavor. Although this "King" is a Chinese word, it is not its old meaning, but it actually admires the King of foreign goods, just like the queen of school queens and city queens, it admires the Western Queen, and has nothing to do with the queen in the old palace.</p>
<p>Although "King" has this title in the past, it was most prosperous during the Zhou Dynasty and the Warring States period. At that time, there was no emperor, and even the Emperor of Zhou was just a king. "The world returns to the king," Mencius said, "King the world" (the word king is a verb, not a noun), being able to be "king" means being the supreme and the common master of the world. As the Zhou Dynasty declined, the countries that were enfeoffed invaded each other and called themselves heroes and added the title of king. This trend reached its climax with the Seven Heroes of the Warring States. When Qin annexed the six kingdoms and unified the world, he called himself "First Emperor", and the Han Dynasty followed suit. Since then, the emperor was the emperor, and "king" was a high-level title, or said to be sealed soil, or to enjoy salary in the court. As for the Manchu Qing princes and so on, they were all sealed titles but not feudalized. Officials and civilians called them "Lord King", but there was no saying of "Great King". Only in novels such as Journey to the West, the mountain elves and water monsters are called "Great King", and in Yue Fei, Niu Gao is a bandit and is called "Fair King". Other big thieves are called "Mountain King", then "Great King" is a monster, a bandit.</p>
<p>As European customs spread eastward, anyone who dominates in commerce and industry, or monopolizes an advantage with a unique skill, is said to be King, translated as "So-and-so King", and the name of "King" is revived, but it is different from the past. Tan Xinpei's "King" is "Ocean-style", it is "fashion", not "Beijing-style", you must know.</p>
