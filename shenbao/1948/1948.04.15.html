<h3>主席蒞臨國大會堂　聽取全部外交報告　王世杰說明局勢極嚴重</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕蔣主席十四日晨曾蒞臨國大會堂小坐一小時許。主席着軍便服，於開會前五分鐘蒞臨，坐長官席，於聽取外交報告及一部份內政報告後，由側門出。時為十時卅五分，在會場時間共一小時又一刻鐘。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國民大會第八次大會，十四日晨九時廿五分舉行，出席代表一五八七人，主席團第三組輪值，由陳　光主席，宣布開會。秘書處宣　報告後，開始本日議程，進行政治報告，分由外交·內政·教育·社會四部部長先後報告施政概況，十二時廿分散會。</p>
<p>王世杰部長首先報告外交，特舉五點，分別說明：</p>
<p>第一，世界和平與我國之態度：王氏稱：當前局勢極為嚴重，第二次世界大戰結束已二載餘，但戰勝國至今未成立一對德·對日之共同政策，因而對德·對日和約至今未能成立。因之，中國必須繼續努力，以促成一切加強聯合國力量之計劃之實現。吾人主張：（一）限制否決權之濫用，（二）迅速依照聯合國憲章立一國際武力。</p>
<p>第二，中美關係：對日戰爭結束後，美與我兩重大援助，即協助我政府將二三百萬之日俘，日僑遣送返日，協助運送大量國軍至東北，華北執行接收工作。至我政府對美政策，仍在維持並增進兩國間傳統友誼與合作，美最近通過之援華貸款，目的在協助我經濟走上安定之路，我將用以彌補國際收支之不敖及收回法幣，減少發行，協助生產。</p>
<p>第三，中蘇關係及其他：中國因基於中蘇兩國邊境接壤達數千公里，必須能維持永遠和平友好關係，而訂立中蘇友好同盟條約。如能嚴格實行，中蘇必然可友好和平相處。</p>
<p>第四，日本問題：我國主張在軍事方面求嚴厲，在經濟方面可使日人求得自足自給，以扶助一新生的民主之日本。在和約訂立之時，中國將堅決主張設置一管制機構。</p>
<p>第五，保僑問題：最基本工作在向各國交涉訂立新的，使華僑在新約之下，得到與他國橋民平等待遇。</p>
<p>張厲生報告內政　今後將特別注意地方自治事業</p>
<p>張厲生部長報吿內政，略分三點說明：一為地方自治工作槪况，一為辦理各種選舉情况，一為人民基本權利之保障。張氏首稱：自制憲國大閉幕後，內政工作即以準備行憲為中心。關於地方自治問題，因各地遭遇八年抗戰，損失均甚重，而若干地區復限於剿匪軍事，未能普遍推行。惟計地方民意機構之成立，各縣鄕鎭已達全額百分之八十，而由於民意機構之監督，地方政務史治亦有相當成就。今後對敎育，衛生，戶籍及土地登記等地方自治事業，均將特別注意。張氏次述辦理選舉之經過，就監委及國代之選舉經過報吿後，特別向大會申述渠不能辭卸之責。渠强調稱：此次辦理選務，個人曾犯最大錯誤，即過份重視當前黨派合作關係，因而發生若干困難及意外之麻煩，個人應負此責，且不盼詣位之原諒。張氏報告此點時，曾獲得若干熱烈之掌聲。第三為人民基本權利之保障，根據憲法之規定，出版法業已修改，新聞檢查已取消，至人身自由問題，屬於警察總署，目前警政尙不能盡如理想之辦理完善，惟將來必按憲法之規定，人民獲得應得之權利，並盼代表返鄉後，指導國民貫澈中央政策政令，合力戡亂，期建國必成。</p>
<p>教育報告</p>
<p>朱家驊報吿敎育時，首述戰時敎育若干措施，勝利後以不合環境需要而有所改變，敎育復員工作，根據敎育復員會議決定，至卅五年底完成，惟復員費過少，辦理頗為困難。朱氏繼就數重要問題報吿：（一）學校及學生數量，戰後較戰前已有顯著增加，惟初等敎育因共匪盤踞叛亂，學生數减少，然質的方面，未見進步，反因師資缺乏而低落。（二）基本敎育，力謀普及，本年上半年以八千億補助各省市辦理基敎，正愼重分配，使公平合理，以收成效。（三）敎育經費拮据，今年上半年佔預算百分之十二，其中半數以上用作學生膳費及敎職員待遇，敎職員待遇，因與公務員並列，敎部僅能關懷而已。（四）救濟失學失業靑年，仍由失學失業靑年輔導委會續辦，希望以後由各省市自辦，由中央統籌經費。（五）近來學風不振，原因甚多，固不可避免，然最大問題為共黨之煽動，敎部對此極注意，絕不姑息，亦盼各代表及社會力量協助，轉移頹風。</p>
<p>社會報告</p>
<p>谷正綱之社會報吿，共分三項：（一）難民救濟，谷氏於報吿方針方式及實施情形後，指出政府所撥振款，尙不能謂盃水車薪，而是千里鵝毛。今後改進，　着重增加振款來源，除希望友邦協助外，特別注重於救濟特捐之勸募。（二）勞工情形，谷氏謂社部係就改進勞工生活，消滅勞資糾紛，扶植勞工參政三點實施領導，現有組織之勞工達五百萬人，彼等為打擊共黨之最大力量。（三）扶助職業團體發展，肚部根據憲法上自由民主精神，修訂各項法規，健全各團體基層組織，指導成立全國性組織並充實之。近年已有進步現象，以數字言之，全國現有職業團體七一七二一個，團體會員一一六三〇九個，會員二八三七八〇〇四人，其領導人均為本業人士。</p>
<h3>主席團會議</h3>
<p>今日議程提大會硏究</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國大主席團十四日晚八時開會，潘公展主席，潘氏報告接見大中學皖籍學生請願經過後，決定送國府辦理，旋開始討論，決定十五日第九次大會主席上午為何成濬，下午為朱家驊。七組審查委會召集人亦由主席團指定，每組五人至九人，提請大會決定。關於十五日大會議程，以若干代表要求繼續政治，經濟檢討，會中討論頗久，未作定論，因十五日政院開會，如續作政治，經濟檢討，政院各部會首長勢難出席大會旁聽，如依原定議程討論憲法修改案，又恐各代表反對，最後決提出十五日大會研究，如上午不繼續檢討，即討論憲法修正案，檢討則改於下午舉行。</p>
<h3>政府準備授權治安機關　採制止暴亂措施　確保社會秩序及人民生命財產</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕軍聞社訊：據國防部發言人稱：共匪以嚴刑峻法，統制其佔領區，用恐怖屠殺，以脅迫人民參加叛亂，而反利用政府區之自由環境，組織地下工作，從事間諜活動，並以罷課，罷工，遊行，示威等手段，發展各種暴動行為，響應其流竄，擴大其叛亂行為，政府根據匪方自首份子有關上述情况之報告，為確保社會秩序及人民之生命財產，於必要時將依法授權各地衛戍，警備，保安等治安機關，採取制止暴亂之措施。</p>
<h3>檢討政治經濟　多數發言批評政府施政不當　新疆蒙古代表要求重視邊政</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國大第八次大會，十四日下午三時四十分繼續舉行，出席代表一五四一人，主席團第四組輪値由陳聯芬主席，宣布開會後，進行政治與經濟之檢討，主席首先提出因要求發言之人數甚多，可否以每單位推出一二代表發言，以求會議進行迅速，惟經代表提出異議後，當仍按照發言條先後個別發言，至六時止，計發言者達十五人，除台省代表一人發言外，餘均北方代表，新疆·蒙古代表發言者四人。尤為今日之特點者，即山西一農民代表亦曾發言，大會至晚六時法定散會時間止，要求發言者尙有三百餘人，雖經主席宣布本日撿討未畢之議程，改定十八日上午繼續舉行，但以北方代表情緒激昂，不願議程中斷，致使會塲有所紛擾。</p>
<p>今日代表之發言，多數批評當前政府施政之不當，尤以邊疆代表一再批評政府對邊疆之忽視，蒙古篤多博稱：連日聽取政府施政報吿中，無一言及蒙古，而蒙古自治方案已擬定，政府竟違反憲法規定，不完成立法手續。扎奇斯欽稱：政府把門打開，蒙古人一定會進來的，政府對不補助蒙古經費，政權不開放，實為極不合理之事。新疆穆提義稱：吾新省同胞，均以已身為中華民國國民為榮，但政府對邊疆如此忽視，以人為政，換一人換一辦法，如此則新疆問題自不能解決，盼中央制定永久性的邊疆民族政策，對權利·義務一一規定，政府人民成予遵守。涂樂幹希望政府能成立邊疆部，專司管理邊疆敎育·文化等各項問題。東北代表咸對經濟問題即流通券問題大肆抨擊，諷張嘉激在東北經濟委會主委任内之措施為「德政」，要求張嘉璈出席會議報吿，並答覆詢問。並稱：東北人不希望特殊，我們全是中國人，遼北楊之屛則希望政府歡迎民間批評，承認批評及勇於改正錯誤，至六時散會。</p>
<h3>晉農民代表　首次發言　會場熱烈鼓掌</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕以農民出身當選代表之山西代表賀敏，十四午後在國大第八次會中發言，此為農民在會中發言之第一人，渠衣着樸素，對襟褂褲一套，發言時亦極撲實，據稱：「我是農民代表，我不會說話，沒有人說過我們農民的話，沒有人知道我們農民的痛苦，我只知道我們種田通種籽都沒有了，我實在受不了。」語畢，鞠躬下台，賀於登發言台前後，各代表均報以極長久之熱烈掌聲。</p>
<h3>曾琦發表比較表　認憲法不宜修改</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕國大主席團已將修改憲法問題列入十五日議事日程，此為國大開幕以來最重要議題之一，中國靑年黨領袖曾琦頃發表其手撰之「維持憲法與修改憲法之利害比較表」，原表如次：（甲）維持憲法之利；（一）可示行憲之決心，（二）可昭大信於天下，（三）可保三黨之立場，（四）可杜共黨之口　。（乙）修改憲法之害：（一）未行而改，無以自解，（二）條文複雜，易啓糾紛，（三）過去苦心，轉遭誤解，（四）由原吿變為被吿，貽共匪以口實，啓中外之疑惑。</p>
<h3>台代表提議　收回琉球</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕全體台灣代表廿九人，已向國大提議，請政府收回琉球，提案內容將於日內招待記者發表。</p>
<p>國大八次會議主席陳　光</p>

<h3>莫德惠等提議　請制定臨時條疑　付總統緊急權限　俾於戡亂期間適應時機　有關修憲提案昨午已截止收受</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕戡亂期間政府一切措施，期能切實負責，以適應時機起見，國代莫德惠等七二一人，特提請「制定動員戡亂時期臨時條款」，其草擬之條款內容如次：</p>
<p>茲依照憲法第一七四條第一款程序，制定動員戡亂時期臨時條款如左：</p>
<p>總統在動員戡亂時期，為避免國家或人民遭遇緊急危難或應付財政·經濟上重大變故，得經政院會議之決議，為緊急處分，不受憲法第三十九條或第四十三條所規定程序之限制。前項緊急處分，立院得依憲法第五十七條第二款規定之程序變更或撇銷之。動員戡亂時期之終止，由總統宣告或由立院咨請總統宣吿之。又國代張知本等因鑒於我憲法上對總統發布緊急命令之權限，僅規定天然災害癘疫或國家緊急事變等因，如遇內亂事變發生，雖因戡亂動員，須為急速處分時，亦不得發布此項命令，殊不足以應國家緊急之需，特提「請大會決議，總統因戡亂動員，得發布緊急命令，以應國家需要案」，其內容並說明，該項命令發布後，得於二個月內提交立院追認。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國大有關修改憲法之提案，十四日午截止收受，已提出者有十七案。</p>

<h3>主席致美總統函　麥克納特已在白宮呈遞　杜魯門向國會報告我配糧情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕最近自中國返美之美援華聯合會理事會主席麥克納特，今覲見杜魯門總統，並呈遞將主席及菲總統羅哈斯之函件，守於白宮之記者，曾詢麥氏與總統會談何事及該兩函之內容，麥氏均拒作答。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統本日向國會提出報吿稱：中國第一次完備之糧食配給計劃，現正由美國救濟物資在中美官員聯合主持之計劃下予以支持。該項計劃，於三月一日在京，滬，平，津，廣州等五大都市中心實行，事前擬就具體計劃，將美國救濟供應品妥為儲藏，然後按月照限價分配，使各級人民均沾其惠。在四月三日杜魯門總統所簽署之援外法案下，對華追加基金之核准，可望保證對華之救濟物資繼讀流通。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統十三日致國會報吿書一份，報吿迄一九四七年年底止之援外經過稱：根據去年五月聯總結束後之救濟法案及去年十二月之臨時救濟法案，為中國而購買之一切物資，將於一九四八年夏初全數抵華。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　且從國代聽民情</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「主席！主席！緊急動　，政治·經濟檢討要延長時問，在明天繼續。」</p>
<p>「主席，我的發言單是昨大早晨送到主席台的，為何還不準我講話？」</p>
<p>「主席，主席！」十四日午後會議是在混亂裏散去的，但一小部代表又蜂擁上了主席台，因為他們根本沒有注意到十三日會議裏已通過把經濟檢討併到十四日與政治檢討同時舉行，倘時問不够，在十八日（星期日）早晨再繼續進行。主席合緊張萬分，秘書長洪蘭友拿着會議紀錄和議事規則，有理說不通。主席陳聯芬，看看不對，溜得不見踪影。</p>
<p>連日來政府的官樣報吿，似乎並沒引起多大注意，人人都是以檢討為自己發言的機會。可是檢討者儘管檢討，每到下午的檢討時間，會塲中總是疏疏落落，今天休息後，出席人數至多不過千人。</p>
<p>對經濟政治施政報吿，要檢討的靠近兩百人。就十四日午後十五個人的言論，我們已可看出部份民情。認為被忽視了的邊疆代表們，提出了呼籲；經濟被扼死的東北代表們，提出了抗議：光復區的代表，痛心疾首指責接收大員。普遍的意見，要懲辦貪官汚吏，更有人提出要動用在美逃資，以助戡亂。山西農民代表賀敏是道地莊稼漢，他說：種田沒有種籽。山東趙庸夫則對誤盡國事的派　傾軋，大肆抨擊。除了第一位生活特殊的代表，砌詞造句，不知所云，被噓下來以外，其餘十四位的快語，都令　在會塲里的代表，得意的鼓掌，政府長官席上，則仍是默無一言。</p>
<p>蒙古代表篤多博和扎奇斯欽都是傑出的演說家。篤多博指責中央對蒙古各盟旗自治的決議諾言，至今沒有兌現，說行政院對蒙藏委會所擬盟旗地方自治法草案的立法程序的拖延，是欺騙，是建憲，扎奇斯欽質問：為何沒有邊政報尙？為何不給蒙藏委會實權？質問國家對於邊疆建設，教育救濟花了幾個錢？</p>
<p>新疆代表穆提義和涂樂幹，都强調團結，他們說，在政府部長們的報吿裏，述「邊疆」這個名詞也沒聽到。穆提義先問長城外面是不是中國領土？接着指責吳忠信忽視新疆政治社會的民族因素，幸有張治中的開明政策，和皎皎治績，才把人心收復。他說：「新疆同胞們都在疑懼張將軍不能總在新疆主政，他一旦離開了，換個人又怎麼樣？我們要求中央有一個永久的邊疆民族政策，給大家信心與安慰」。</p>
<p>西康夷族代表傳正達說：「西南夷胞武力有卅萬人槍，政府為何不予以組訓重用保衛西南」？</p>
<p>合灣代表謝掙强高呼「政府要不要合灣？要不要台灣！」他說：台灣的秩序都被破壞完了，他抗議內地人的特殊，使台胞覺得仍像殖民地，白部長宣慰時的諾言，全沒成事實，但台胞決不會要求獨立，更不會要求託管。「台灣永遠是中國的，合胞的心是向着祖國的！」</p>
<p>東北代表林　山和楊之屏，强調東北經濟比軍事要嚴重十倍。林　山說：杜韋明蓋章的法幣和紀軍票，張嘉璈不肯兌換，流通券發行額超過了五萬億（照官價折合，將近法幣六十萬億），形同冥鈔廢紙。他說：「這都是張嘉激先生的德政，我們唯一要求是流通券照官價十一點五比一進關流通。東北人民在吃豆餅，吃豬食，我們也是中國人，為什麼用這種特殊辦法把我們關在關外，急死餓死！請張嘉璈先生饒了我們東北四十萬人民的性命吧！我們眞是感恩不盡。」楊之屛指責東北行轅處置失當，去年民間的存糧和百多萬噸可出口的大豆，都被匪掠走。崔榮主張打老虎，也主張取消不必要的東北特殊行政機構。</p>
<p>河北代表李維周道出政治無能，在於制度不分權責，政治腐敗在於幹部沒有新陳代謝。于華峯質問經濟部燃管會，南運煤每月十萬噸，賣給上海廠家，每噸要賺六百萬，這錢並未繳國軍，那里去了？</p>
<p>興安代表富德淳，要求動用在美存款，由國大派代表去美交涉提用，由我們組織「豪門權門資木使用委員會。」用於加强戡亂。</p>
<p>這是十四日檢討政治經濟發言的這十四位代表的意見所表達的民意，在不同裏顯示着一致，在訴苦中透露着積極。（四月十四日於南京）</p>

<h3>社論　美洲冷戰的第一回合</h3>
<p>當泛美會議正在波哥大進行重要討論.時候，哥倫比亞國內突然發生了「赤色政變」，不僅哥國政局今後的發展，惹起世人的注意；而且馬歇爾國務卿的安全及泛美會議的賡續，也引起了世人深刻的關切。這幾天來，「赤色政變」的計劃巳歸失敗，自由與保守兩黨所組織的聯合新政府，也巳正式成立；同時泛美會議仍在那裏繼續舉行，從表面上看來，這一次的風潮可以就此平息了；但是從另一個角度去觀察，美蘇兩國所從事的冷戰，巳經從歐亞兩洲蔓延到南美洲了。這次哥國發生政變，不過是美蘇在南美洲發生冷戰的第一回合而巳。</p>
<p>緣在哥國發生政變之後，美哥兩國的朝野就一致認為：這是共產黨企圖破壞泛美會議的陰謀。所以哥國新政府一經宣吿成立，立即就以共產黨參與暴動為理由，宣佈與蘇聯斷絕外交關係；同時馬歇爾國務卿也向各國代表，公然譴責共產黨企圖煽動世界革命，他說：「哥國政變，實與鼓動法義等國罷工曁企圖妨害義大利選舉之事件，同出一型。吾人在此間採取行動時，務須明瞭，此一事變實為世界事件，不僅僅限於哥國或拉丁美洲。此次共黨故意策動政變，其用意乃在破壤泛美會議，以因窘西半球，從而影響義大利的四月選舉。』從馬卿簡短的談話裏，也可以看出美蘇兩國間的冷戰，巳從歐亞兩洲蔓延到南美洲，哥國的政變，不過是對方向南美洲發動冷戰的第一步而巳；智利和玻利維亞以及其他國家，都有發生類似政變的可能，日來智利　城巳充滿了謠言，謂共產黨將於五月一日發動政變，大有風聲鶴唳之勢，使智利當局也不得不採取緊急國防措置，以預防共產黨發動政變。</p>
<p>這次泛美會議　　開，美國當局始終甚為重視，馬歇爾國務卿親自前往參加，就抱着「攘外必先安內」的動機，要求西半球各國加强團結，實行聯防，一致對外，所以這次會議的主要議題：一為設立美洲永久防務委員會，以實施去年成立的泛美聯防公約；二為簽訂泛美經濟合作協定；三為建立泛美和平制度。由此可知，這次泛美會議的任務，實在非常重大，不啻是美國在歡洲對蘇聯從事冷戰的基點。所以在蘇聯眼中看來，認為美國企圖通過泛美會議，加强其對於南美洲各國在政治上，經濟上，軍事上的控制，因此不免有破壞泛美會議的陰謀，策動哥國發生政變，自為蘇聯對美國的一種有力還擊。我們在泛美會議開幕之際，早就指出美洲廿一國的代表，懾於共產勢力潛入世界各處的危機，益惑西半球有通力合作加强聯繫的必要；並預料到這次會議必能擭得圓滿結果。現在受了哥國政變的影響，以致會議一度停頓，能不能如期結東，確然也成為問題了。但是從另一角度去觀察：這次哥國的政變，使廿一國代表對於赤色的恐怖，個個身歷其境，人人親身目睹，無不驚心動魄，深感共產勢力的威脅，更加促成他們的團結，也是必然的後果。</p>
<p>但是哥國這次發生政變最大的意義，乃在給予馬歇爾國務卿一個當頭棒喝。使他恍然大悟，兩個世界的對立，並沒有地域上的楚河漢界，把兩個世界劃分得淸淸楚楚。如在歡洲有東歡與西歐之分；而共產勢力有如水銀瀉地無孔不入，在今日世界的任何一角落，都有共產勢力潛伏着，隨時可以出現，隨時可以發生鬥爭。歐洲是如此，亞洲是如此，甚至在美洲，也是如此。馬歇爾國務　只看到歐洲的危機，而忽親了其他地方所受到共產勢力的威脅，固執着他的「歡洲第一」的政策，不肯稍加變更，我們相信美國政府遲早必將再鑄成歷史上的錯誤。我們深望馬卿能接受這次哥國政變的敎訓，對於現行外交政策，澈底重新加以檢討。放大眼光，統　全局，早作明智的決策，以挽回世界的狂瀾於未倒！</p>
<p>其次，我們站在第三者的立塲，以冷眼來看美蘇變方所進行的冷戰，我們只看到蘇聯行動迅速，手法高明，處處先發制人，步步着先鞕，不論在歐洲或亞洲，均已處於不可動搖的地位了；而且蘇聯並不以此為滿足，在歐洲，蘇聯企圖將其　幕移向大西洋及地中海，對於義大利四月選舉及法國五月選舉，均將有驚人的舉動；對於德國，更有利用德人不滿意英美的心理，在東德西德以及柏林，發動反英美運動。此在亞洲更不必說了，蘇聯對於朝鮮早有準備，對於中國共黨不斷的予以接濟，東南亞洲也巳有共產國際的組織。但是回過頭來看看美國，只聽到一片反共的吶喊，而沒有看到實際有效的行動。在一年以前，我們早已聽到杜魯門主義的鼓吹，馬歇爾計劃的倡導，但是一年以來，美國已幹了些什麼？誰也不能不表示懷疑；杜魯門總統受了捷克政變的刺激，才表示其對於世界和平的信心巳開始動搖，才主張美國應該實行徵兵及普遍軍訓，美國當局對於戰後的世界缺乏遠見和先知，已是不可否認的事實。時至今曰，連美國所在的「世外桃源」西半球，也感受到共產勢力的威脅了，哥倫比亞這次發生政變，雖巳敗露，但是誰能保證南美各國不發生同樣的政變呢！所以哥倫比亞這次政變，是美蘇在美洲發生冷戰的第一回合，不啻給美國朝野一個嚴重的警吿，使他們再也不能粉飭天下太平，對於目前的國際危機，更不能不特別提高警覺了·</p>

<h3>卓陽解圍記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派華中戰地記者　卜眠</p>
<p>〔本報阜陽十一日訊〕阜陽舊為潁州府，位於潁商兩河之交，豫皖交通要道，皖北之第一大城。在歷史上，它早已寫下了一頁光榮的詩篇。此次劉陳二匪集結八萬之衆，揚言三日內攻入阜陽，結果，不但沒有進城，反被國軍打得一敗塗地，潰不成軍，如果我們對歷史不過分健忘的話，當可記得宋高宗時，劉錡於此曾以四萬兵力，擊敗金兀朮十數萬之犯兵，今日阜陽大捷，也有些相像。</p>
<p>能劉伯誠部一，二，三，六，十一，及陳毅部之十縱隊，金少山獨立旅四個團，及魏鳳樓獨立旅，共約八萬餘人，携帶三日糧，由劉匪親任指報官，統率大軍進犯阜陽，於廿九日夜十二時發動全面圍城攻勢，向阜陽之東南西郊圍攻，我守城部隊在李司令官指揮之下，沉着應戰，奮勇迎擊。卅日拂曉，金匪之獨立旅主力，單獨向西郊進攻，其主力仍攻東南及北郊，我空軍機羣出動，凌空助戰，匪負重傷，攻勢頓挫，士氣沮喪，當即停止猛力之攻勢，作兵力之調整，重行部署，一方面陸續增援，準備再度反撲。</p>
<p>卅日十一時，阜蒙公路利現舖。馬家店。插花廟一帶，發現匪之援軍，我邱師之西進部隊，當即予以截擊。入晚，匪先以兩連之兵力，向城郊猛撲，作試探之進攻，經我軍微薄之抵抗，即行吿退。旋發動大規模攻勢，集中兵力於一點，鏖戰東關，我邱維達師之有利一部，雖衆寡懸殊，仍堅守陣地，誓死抵抗。東關三失三得，匪傷亡殆盡，此為戰事進展之最高潮。</p>
<p>匪經此打擊后，對圍攻卓陽之企圖巳無形動搖，劉匪為顧全「面子」及揚言三日攻入阜陽計，仍岡孤注一擲，卅一日拂曉，匪以山砲向我城垣猛轟，並以重兵器熾盛火力之制壓，作為掩護，向東北關各據點繼續攻擊，我軍亦以濃密火網，使匪軍無法前進，雙方乃呈膠着狀態。匪以攻勢受阻，進退維谷，即不惜重大之犧牲，施行「人海戰術」，方突破東北之據點，但天明後，我空軍飛凌上空，投彈十數枚，該據點遂又吿收復。迄晚十時，匪軍再發動第三次攻堅，城郊西北及北關，西關，東岳廟，三里園等處砲兵之陣地（山砲十餘門），向我不斷轟擊，掩護前進，匪向北關猛犯，未幾，東關外之關帝廟文風塔，及西關外之打蛋廠之匪，以信號彈及俄製指揮槍之誘導，並以烟幕及重火器之掩護，反覆猛撲，我守軍仍堅守崗位，作殊死之抵抗。東關外及東南角，文風塔，北關，及東北角四處，激戰尤烈，經澈夜之鏖戰，東關外堤工事被匪砲火破壤，我軍盡最大之努力，勇猛爭奪數次，終以寡不敵衆，迄一日六時，我軍自動掃淸射界，轉移東關之陣地，縱續堵擊。匪利用强大砲火之解障，接近我陣地，幷用地雷爆炸，破壤我陣地之障礙物，守軍浴血搏鬥，在獲得重大代價下，放棄文風塔，但其餘各陣地，迄在我手。</p>
<p>當阜陽序幕戰揭開時，我豫南張司令官之精銳兵團，於大雨傾盆下，北上馳援。卅一日阜陽圍城，大戰萬分緊張之時，張將軍以迅雷不及掩耳之動作，由方家集·趙集·馬李店，渡過洪河，匪軍聞風披靡，勢如破竹。次日進抵公立橋，謝集，匪之後路及側背咸受重大威脅，若再繼續圍攻阜陽，則將全部被殲滅於阜陽近郊。同時，匪之三六縱隊亦遭張部之奇襲，死傷慘重，率陽之圍遂解。是役匪死傷萬餘人以上，俘千餘名，戰利品鹵獲甚夥。</p>
<p>阜陽解圍了，雖然經過了四天的緊張生活，但依舊又回復它那寗靜與和平了。</p>

<h3>特港歸還義大利　蘇覆文予以拒絕　英艦駛抵特港防止動亂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：特　埃斯特訊，蘇聯宣佈拒絕英美所提將特港交還義大利之建議後，此間形勢甚為緊張。共產黨控制之勞工聯合會舉行特別會議，預料對於親義大利之示威遊行將加以阻撓。昨日午夜所發出之特別跟工呼籲巳發生影響，除軍事據關·醫院及慈善機關外，大多數店舖及麵包店等業巳停閉。特港之義國報紙則以「目前吾人當知義國之敵人何在」為標題，登載蘇聯拒絕英美建議之消息。警察為預防衝突起見，巳採取警戒措置。此外，英國航空母艦「勝利」號在驅逐艦「契維沃」號護送下，自威尼斯開抵特港。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十三日電〕莫斯科電台今夜廣播稱：蘇聯巳向英美法三國提出照會，拒絕三國建議召開四國會議討論特里埃斯特交還義大利問題。蘇聯認為特港之劃為自由區，係義大利和約所規定，此項和約則係四國外長會議擬訂而經二十一國簽字。今欲利用通信或召開私人會議的方式加以修改，不但碍難接受，抑且違背民主原則。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬十四日電〕蘇聯拒絕考慮將特港交還義國之建議後，引起此間政界之惶恐，義政府並不掩飾其重大之不滿，特別係對於外界謠傳謂在義大利大選時蘇聯將採取行動「援助義大利人民陣綫」一事。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕一般觀察蘇聯拒絕三月廿日美·英·法三國之建議，乃為對四月十八日義普選中對共黨之嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>〔聯合肚特里埃斯特十四日電〕此間親義大利派今日聆悉蘇聯拒絕討論將特港交還義大利後，甚為沮喪。民衆五萬人明夜原擬在聯合廣塲開會，屆時所發表之宣言語氣或將因此改觀。一部份人士認為可能演成反蘇示威運動。其他人士則稱，蘇聯此舉無異巳承認義大利共產黨在十八日普選將吿失敗。</p>
<h3>義競選運動熱烈　美機結隊將作示威飛行　義總理揭露共黨阻歐復興陰謀</h3>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十四日電〕距義大利二十五年來之第一次普選，已僅餘四天，各政黨之競選運動亦隨之愈見熱烈。道路行人道上及牆端屋際，出現形形色色之標語及便利文盲識別之奇幻標記。</p>
<p>基督民主黨之標記為一十字軍之盾牌，上書「自由」字樣。共黨領導之人民陣綫則採用以紅星為背景，上印義大利先賢加里波的肖像之圖案為標記。選民祗須在標記上劃一十字，即作為選舉何黨。競選運動預定於四月十六日開始投票前之四十八小時停止。加斯貝利總理及共黨領袖托格里亞蒂，正在全國巡迴演講。且大多在同一城市演說，有時先後相距時間不過一小時，加斯貝利昨在米蘭演說後，今日又至南部西西里之巴萊莫演說，渠之最後一次競選演說將在那不勒斯發表。托格里亞蒂亦決定在加斯貝利在那不勒斯演說後之一小時，在同一處所發表其最後一篇競選演說。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十三日電〕義總理加斯貝利十三日在米蘭大敎堂前廣塲向大批民衆致辭，透露渠已擭有秘密文件，證明共黨具有對抗馬歇爾方案之秘密計劃，擬在各受惠國家普遍製造動亂，該一文件詳載義共領袖龍谷與蘇共黨領袖史丹諾夫在波籣畢亞利斯托克開會之經過，關於對抗馬歇爾方案之計劃，在會中已有詳細之指示，包括在法義等國製造普遍動亂，使美援不得不撤回等。文件內並指明義共為執行此項計劃起見，將不致缺乏執行的方法。加斯貝利在號稱義共基地的米蘭重申其在前數次競選演說中之要求，囑共黨領袖命令共黨放下武器，此語博得全塲之掌聲。義共黨領袖托格里亞蒂亦於十三日夜向全國廣播，强調聲明人民陣綫堅決拒絕參加足以引義國進入新戰爭的任何集團或同盟，以拯救義人民的利益。</p>

<p>〔路透社肚柏林十四日電〕柏林四强聯合司令部昨夜舉行會議前，蘇聯曾圖結束四强對柏林警察制度之共同控制及否認柏林運輸處長魯埃特之職權。</p>
<p>蘇聯指責美國實際上已使柏林美軍區內之警察，不受中央警局之節制，美方且復使用警察以壓制區內居民中之民主份子，因此美軍區內盜賊　起。按四强共管警察制如果結束，將使蘇聯得有籍口，在柏林各區交界處之實施邊界邊查，而否認柏林市運輸處長魯埃特之職權，殆亦為加緊管制對柏林區供應來源之先聲。</p>

<h3>制止公用事業漲價　價格計算公式不合理　請政院恢復貼補政策　參議會公用事業調查會決議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會公用事業調查委員會，於昨日下午三時，在塘沽路該會舉行首次會議，出席參議員唐世昌·朱亞揆·襲夏·朱扶九·李開第·高叔安等卅人；列席公用局長趙曾珏。主席姜豪。討論事項：（一）關於中央核定公用事業價格調整公式如何請求中央變更案，決議：自本年一月中央頒行公用事業價格計算公式以後，本市各公用事業價格巳調整四次，逐次增加甚多，查公敎人員及工商界職工之待遇，實際上絕未能比照物價之增漲，作合理之調整，中央對於公用事業之價格，首先定於方式，承認其能依照生活指數及物價指數之增漲，每月調整一次，比較生活指數之增漲尤多，超出一般人民之負担能力，顯失公平，為此決議，應由本會電請行政院，考慮停止公用事業價格計算公式之繼續適用，及恢復貼補政策，制止公用事業之漲價，以免領導一般物價上漲，並請在中央未決定適當辦法以前，五月份起，此項公式應即停止適用，以免造成社會不安之嚴重後果。（二）調查工作，應如何進行案，決議：關於計算公式，頗有不妥之處，請公用局研究修正。至於公司盈虧人事配備，以及其他使用燃料及原物料之實際情况，由本會分三組進行調查，並請先行搜集供給充份材料，各組人選，由議長指定之。分組辦法如下：甲·第一組—自來水·電氣·煤氣。乙·第二組—電話。丙·第三組—電車，公共汽車，輪渡，小型鐵路·至六時許始告散會。</p>
<p>出席委員發言抨擊　希望負責當局注意　謀取緊急合理措施</p>
<p>昨日會議中，各委員對於四月來公用事業之接連劇烈上漲，先後發言抨擊，電話，電力，自來水各項，尤為各方抨擊之目標。嚴諤聲特別提出北平市參議會最近發動之公用事業漲價抗繳運動，希望負責當局正視高價公用事業之嚴重性，謀取緊急合理措施。李文杰繼作更激烈之發言，對金經會決定之公用事業價格計算公式，不斷抨擊，渠指出該項計算公式中，包含上漲最劇之五金指數，生活指數及外匯，該項計算公式，原則上即使合理，但在最大多數市民工作待遇均不合理之今日，單獨合理，反而成為不合理，渠並表示，各公用事業均為民營事業，地方議會依法有限制之權，如有必要，參議會不妨召開臨時大會，要求中央重行考慮，不必拘於少數未明實際情形專家所擬定之公式，使市民負能力不勝之負担，此項意見，獲得席間熱烈響應，復經詳加硏討後，遂作上列之兩項決議。</p>
<p>趙局長表示　恢復貼補　不易辦到</p>
<p>記者於會後復探詢趙局長對於上項二決議案之意見。據趙局長稱，參議會之意見，乃代表民意，政府自當尊重，但關於第一點請中央於五月起停止公用事業價格計算公式之繼續適用及恢復貼補政策，在事實上有困難，短時期內不易辦到，中央是否能照准，頗成問題。又據趙局長吿稱，渠對於公用事業之原料價格，正在積極與央行張總裁商討，儘量設法以免高漲，最近方與張總裁商洽，對於公用事業用油外匯請准予先結一個半月或二月，如經中央許可，則間接即可使公用事業便格稍為穩定。</p>
<p>至於第二項關於參議會調查工作，公用局決搜集充分材料，供給參議會參考審查，如審查後有疑問，儘可向各該公司直接詢問或調查。</p>

<h3>世界最高峯之謎　三日內即可分曉　央航專機飛積石山　運用雷達測量高度</h3>
<p>陳文寬認為難超過額非爾士峯</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕積石山探險工作，自電諾虎頭蛇尾，臨陣脫逃之後，巳正式宣吿中止。而積石山高度之謎，乃為萬衆矚目。「自力探險」之計劃，業由國立中央硏究院積極推進中，惟因科學儀器一時籌備不及，最早須俟秋節始克實現。中央航空公司，為謀「謎」之早日揭曉，特派C47型XTT62專機一架，招待本市中外新聞記者，偕飛積石山作初步之測量。</p>
<p>專機定今晨七時正自龍華機塲起飛，當天可抵蘭州，在蘭勾留一夜，翌日晨即飛積石山探測，如天氣良好，飛航順利，當日獲得成果，則後日即可返歸上海矣。</p>
<p>專機由央行副總經理陳文寬親自駕駛。陳氏於抗戰期間，曾飛越喜馬拉雅山駝峯百餘次。據悉：陳氏亦嘗數度飛越積石山，根據渠之經騐，認為積石山高度超過世界最高額非爾士峯之說，實不可能。現陳氏決利用專機上之「雷達」設備，測量飛機與積石山巓之距離，然後根據座機之高度表，以計算積石山之準確高度。據悉，以「雷達」測量山高，雖準確而不精密。惟據陳氏表示，渠對於證明積石山不超過額非爾士高峯一點，似甚有把握，則積石山是否可登世界最高峯之皇座，兩三日後即可望分曉矣。</p>
<p>此番隨機同往之新聞記者計十二人，名單如下：中央通訊社呂乃綱，宣文傑。合衆社袁倫仁，聯合社約翰·羅特立克，大美晚報蓋世克會勃，生活雜誌傑克·朋斯，紐約時報喬奇·亞歷山特生，中央攝影塲朱人駿戴勝潮，新聞報魏志剛，本報洪絮才。</p>

<p>上海市總工會，為促使參加匪黨組織之工人速即反省自首起見，昨特發出通吿，分致各產職業工會，囑請切實勸吿，並加意檢舉潛伏匪黨。原文如下：「查上（三）月間本市軍警當局在滬破獲共匪陰謀重要機關，當根據所獲文件，逮捕大批奸匪份子，本會於明瞭內幕後，即有嚴正之表示，絕對擁護政府肅淸共匪，對於善良工人，則當負責保障，經於四月五日發表告本市軍政當局及勞資雙方意見書，並要求政府提早依法審理被捕工人及保障善良工友，並予盲從者許以自新之路，復要求各廠資方，本勞資合作之精神，避免乘此時機壓迫工友，或留難工會之行為，更勸吿各工友努力自肅安心工作。茲政府已明白表示，凡被誘脅參與共匪工作者，如迅向政府自首，決可給予自新之機會，並可保障其職業及身體之安全。邇來經向政府自首者為數甚多，均已獲得切實之保障與自由，均係事實，惟本市工友人數頗衆，本會深恐不免仍有誤入歧途或前曾參加共匪工作現已悔悟而有所畏懼不敢自首者，亦有其人，務希貴會切實勸吿速向政府自首，本會當予保證，定可獲得政府之保障，並盼加意檢舉潛伏匪黨份子，以淸亂源，似此則可符合國家戡亂建國之大計，且能安定社會之秩序」云。</p>
<h3>陶雲山談　參加經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕曾參加匪黨而於上月間向警局自首，甫於前日保釋之前三區絲織業產業工會理事長陶雲山，昨日下午在社會局，應記者之請，談參加匪黨經過，赴匪區受訓，調派來滬活動及最近自首等前後經過甚詳。陶為紹興人，肄業於紹興初級中學，曾任小學敎師。民國廿七年來滬，入美亞綢廠學藝，在敵人槍刺下到處展開愛國運動，美亞工人由陳某領導，組織「節約救國會」，募款匯重慶中央銀行，及組織反偽工會等工作，陶亦參加活動，並當選工人代表，與陳某朝夕相共，思想上頗受其影響，而陳實係共匪幹部。民國卅年陳離滬赴內地，臨行將所有工作移交於陶，並介紹陶加入共黨。及至同年十二月八日美日開戰，日軍進佔租界，「節約救國會」解散。卅二年二月間美亞擬在天津設立新廠，陶被派赴天津工作，因未於事前徵得共黨同意，故在此時期內與共黨斷絕關係。卅四年初回申，脫離美亞，與友人合資在蘇州自行創設絲廠，然因動力發生問題，該廠未經生產即行結束，虧累不少，陶亦由是失業。卅四年春在蘇州偶遇共匪之「交通公司」（護送淪陷區黨員赴「解放區」之組織）人員，邀其往「解放區」受訓，陶欣然就道，遂被送至安徽六合附近新舖鎭，入「建設大學」受訓。同年八月十一日日本投降，即被派潛行來滬工作，領導三區絲織工會發動工潮，至前年夏季歡送馬叙倫晋京請願大遊行後，共匪高級認為陶表現過於露骨恐有危險，指令暫行隱匿，等候機會潛回「解放區」，再行訓練，惟陶認為無此需要，不予服從，因此共匪對之甚為不滿，陶之思想亦因朝夕與政府機關接觸，對國民黨日漸發生好感；並於去年正式加入國民黨，迨此次治安當局破獲共匪秘密機關，根據名册擬加拘捕，陶得訊後即避居新閘路樂羣中學友人處凡四日，經一再考慮，乃決定自首。最後陶對政府之寬大表示感謝，今後願為國民黨效忠云。</p>

<h3>撥發棉商收花週轉金　紗管會簡化手續</h3>
<p>購進棉花頗旺前途表示樂觀</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於花紗布管委會委託棉商收花工作進展情形，記者昨特再訪棉商業公會理事長劉屏蓀，據稱前向紗管會建議後，連日紗管會硏商簡化手續，業有相當滿意之結果。緣以往各棉商所感困難，祗在於領取週轉金耗費時間一項。實因紗管會事業繁鉅，內部部門較多，撥款事務，旣須力求審愼，必須透渦各關係部門，層層校核，難免費時。現經該會各主管部門集合協議，為鼓勵棉商踴躍承購起見，經議定嗣後由撥發週轉金必須通過之財務會計稽核三處室各派經辦員一人，常川在採運處工作，以期審核給照手續，可在同地同時迅速辦竣。惟各承辦棉商至遲須於每日午後二時以前到會，以免時間渦晚，不及辦結。此後凡在下午二時後到會者，均延至次日辦理。經此改革以後，各棉商所感困難，當可順利解決，有裨於未來收購工作，當非淺鮮。又紗管會連日購進棉花頗見暢吒，該會對收花前途頗表樂觀云。</p>
<h3>外埠依然倒懸　棉紗市况萎靡　客幫去化呆布疋起伏狹窄</h3>

<h3>人絲綢市續疲</h3>
<p>昨人絲市况續疲，錄業外各物均見疲軟，又遇綢市再小，因此人心更形虛軟。一二〇號天橋新貸開盤尙站二億三千萬關，業外人逢高有售，曾低見二億二千七百萬。迨至午收稍見回升，終以二億二千九百萬收市，續跌四百萬。東洋及金三馬亦挫四百萬左右。</p>
<p>昨晨綢市，續露疲態。大誠被面，開盤尙做一四〇二〇萬元，旋即步退至一三八四〇萬元，終為二三九二〇萬元，又跌一八〇萬元。璧縐喊少五千元，成交不多。　絲市以市塲配絲消息，紛傳於市，人心轉虛，價遂下挫。晨開CD兩級三四五〇〇萬元，午收成交五祖，開口貨做開七祖，價三四〇〇〇萬元。輯里干經，亦隨回軟五百萬元，外銷方面，聞中蠶公司將有一批緬甸交易，業正洽商中。</p>

<h3>食米初堅後平　麺粉止跌回漲油市下挫</h3>
<p>米市早開繼上日收市之堅勢，貨主繼續喊高，故初價格曾見提升五萬至十萬元，南市塲白粳曾高至三百七十萬，惟云路仍呆滯。後市回平，與上日價相彷彿。白粳仍站三百六十五萬，北市塲除早稻及白元稍昂五萬外，餘均平定。二市到貨甚少，共三千〇八十二石。</p>
<p>麺粉　昨稍回甦，實銷逢低有吸，止跌回漲。老車粉初開即升為一百三十八萬五千，後更以一百三十九萬元收市，略挺一萬五千元。兵船粉漲二萬元，雜牌粉微昂五千至萬元，惟交易尙不見爽朗。麩皮再跌四萬元，小麥小五萬。</p>

<p>後市無特殊進展，除將代辦費拉平而開高少許外，並無建樹。永紗自一八〇〇元起，被進至一八二〇元，但了結者甚多，成交更無起色，滿塲無聊狀態。國行差進雖少，仍退至一七九〇元。收市由一〇四號一六〇號維持，升為一八〇〇元。結果較晨收計國貨麗安尙平，恒豐跌半成，中絲閘北微挫，永紗信和勤興新華永公統益大通榮豐景綸商務火柴均吿小升。塲外各未上市股票仍見平疲。</p>

<h3>英國議會的目的</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>（The　Purpose　of　Parliament，by　Quintin　Hogg，Blandford　Press．一九八頁，十先令半。）</p>
<p>英國是現代民主政治的發源地，目前雖然還保持着君主立憲的政體，但是不論中央或地方的政制，不倫內政或外交的決策，均須取決於議會，議會是國家的最高機關，在積極方面，決定國家的重大政策，提交政府去執行；在消極方面則監督政府，不得妨害人民的基本權利，不得增加人民的痛苦。所以在英國議會的權力，超過一切，以視美國的國會，尤有過之。</p>
<p>當今我國國民大會在首都開會，立法院也將舉行首次會議，中英文化協會赫特萊先生送來「議會的目的」與「下議院」「人民與政府」三書，請我向讀者推薦，我覺得中國的政治剛剛跨開走上民主審政的第一步，尙在入民主幼稚園學習的階段，除了努力學習而外，其他的一切都是廢話，去年我認為中國行憲最重要的工作，首推使人民明瞭憲快的內容與精神，特地寫了一本「中國憲法大綱」交中華書局出版，作為大學敎本，但不適合一般人閱讀。我看了「議會的目的「與「下議院」兩譽後，深深地感覺到：我國出版界對於國民大會和立法院，也應該出版幾本通俗的小册子，使一般人民都能明瞭我國民意機關的如何運用。如果有人採取我的意見，那末這三本小册子，是値得介紹的。</p>
<p>「議會的目的」一書不滿二百頁，但其內容，卻分廿四章。第一章議會的起源，將英國議會發展的過程分為五個階段，演化而成為今日的議會，從這襄也可以看出今日英國的議會是自然發展的結果，也是人民爭取民主的所得的代價。第二章議會的會址，英國議會會所從十三世紀以來，已遭到四次大火，最後一次是一九四一年五月遭德機轟炸而引起大火，下議院的會塲已完全毀壞，現有重造的必要，上議院會塲安然無恙，目前下議院開會，總是假上戰院的會塲。第三章國王，第四章上議院，第五章下議院，把國家元首與議會的關係，說得淸淸楚楚。</p>
<p>第七章議會的特權，第八章議會的權限，第九章內閣。這三章將英國的實際政治的運用，分析詳盡，從這裏我們可以看出英國是採取的賣任內閣制，內閣對於議會負有連帶責任，內閣須獲得議會的信任，否則內閣只有兩條路好走，不是解散議會，就是自動辭職。與英國的總統制是完全不同的。</p>
<p>第十章政黨，第十一章反對黨，把政黨的起源，工黨的崛起，政黨的紀律和政策暨政府黨與反對黨間的關係，無不加以說明並指出容許反對黨的批評，是促進政治進步的勤力，最値得我們的注意。</p>
<p>第十二章文官制，第十三章議會消息的發佈，第十四章議員選舉，第十五章基本程序，第十七章法案的通過，第十八章議會的開慕與休會，第廿章議會的今昔觀，均限於篇幅，不克詳細介紹。</p>
<p>最後一章為世界議會乎？作者提出道個問題，是値得我們重視的，他認為聯合國憲章不足以構成一個自由的世界政府，他說：「一個政府必須有制定法律的立法機關，有執行法律的行政機關，有實施法律的司法機關。而聯合國機構不過是一個永久性質的和平會而已，而且每一個强國均有行使否決權的權力。」（見第一八八頁）作者提出這個意見，値得吾人研究的。</p>

<p>最近大維書同出版的「永恒的追思」是一本散文集，列入「大雄文叢」，收豐子愷，葉聖陶，施蟄存，楊同芳，傅彬然，仁綸，鍾吉宇，勤生諸家所寫的紀念弘一快師（即藝術家李叔同）逝世五周年的文字數篇。</p>
<p>弘一法師未出家前即以書畫詩文見重，早年留學日本，參預革命，回國後致力藝事及敎學，是一個志行高潔不隨流俗的學者。出家後精修梵行，更被人尊為一代高僧。</p>
<p>讀了這書，使我們對弘一法師發生一稱情不自禁的嚮往，那並非由於宗敎的力量，因為作者都沒有把弘一法師純粹看做是一位高僧，也沒有把他看做超人，正如序文中說，他很平凡，「紀念他的平凡，不是紀念他的煊爛。」我想他的充滿了人性的平凡的生涯，正顯示出他的偉大。</p>
<p>豐子愷的「為靑年說弘一法師」一篇，情文並茂，看上去樸實無華，細玩之下卻很耐人尋味。作者為弘一法師未出家時的高足，故於弘師生活知之極深，因而言之亦切。文中述當日弘師敎學情形甚詳，他那種誠懇和認眞的態度眞令人敬佩，末了盛讚他不朽的人格和德業。</p>
<p>葉聖陶的「談弘一法師臨終偈語」，立意深長，他說：「弘一法師臨終作偈兩首，第二首的後兩句是華枝春滿天心月圓，依我的看法，這是描繪他的生活，說明他的生活的體騐；他入世一塲，經歷種種，修習種種，到他臨命終時，正當春滿月圓的時候。這自然是好好的死，但是好好的死，源於好好的活」。這番話無非申述一個人最要緊的是自己的生活態度。</p>
<p>楊同芳的「學習弘一法師的敎育精紳」和傅彬然的「從弘一快師圓寂五週年紀念會歸來」兩文都推重弘一快師在俗時的敎育精神。他的敎學態度是何等誠摯而親切，和易而周密。的確，弘一法師眞不愧為一位偉大的「人師」！</p>
<p>施藝存的「弘一法師贊」，文辭典雅，稱揚弘一法師的勇毅和智慧，這是眞正了解他的心情和抱負而發出來的。</p>
<p>其他幾篇如鍾吉宇的「回憶」，勤生的「精神和實踐的感召」，讀了會使我們進一步認識弘一法師救世的熱忱和躬行踐履的精神。仁綸的「如果弘一法師還活着」，充滿了無限的感喂和憤慨。是的，目前的社會風氣和此壤，國運如此衰微，假如悲天憫人的弘一法師還健在，他能够不痛哭流涕嗎？</p>
<p>在到處滿是機巧，欺詐，殘害，仇恨，冷漠，陰險的現社會裏，我們需要看見一點光，熱，愛，正義和同情。從這位希有的哲人的生活中，我們應該得到很大的感慨吧！</p>
<h3>音樂全書</h3>
<p>— 榮菊珍</p>
<p>（B．Cyclopedia　of　Music　&amp;　Musicians一九四六年第四版）</p>
<p>近年來由於無綫電收音機的普遍，使國人欣賞西洋音樂的機會增加了不少。現代靑年不但知道著名的舞曲「籃色的多瑙河」「濟，女人，歌」之類；即使比較古典的作品如「未完成交響曲」「匈牙利狂想曲」等，也得到熱烈的歡迎。這實在是音樂界的好現象。西洋的月亮當然不會比中國的更圓一些，然而西洋音樂的優越，卻是個不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>音樂的了解固然大部分須要依靠聽覺的鍛練，決不能全憑書本的知識而獲得完全的啓示。但眞正的音樂研究者城欣賞者，似乎還不能不靠書本的帮助。假使我們不在書本上獲得卡門的知識，不知道卡門怎樣的與人相戀，不知道卡門怎樣的被人殺害，而冒然的去聽聆樂劇卡門，這樣，我們對該曲的了解程度，最少要打個折扣。上面的例子，即可證明書本知識的重要。</p>
<p>某於上述的理解，我在這裏提供一本相當完善的音樂參考書，也就是這篇文章的題目—「音樂全書」。此書由美國音樂家湯姆遜祖任主綸，其中撰稿的人，除去美國音樂界的名家學者之外，更包括英國以及歐陸上德，法，意諸國的作曲家，音樂敎育家，指揮者，音樂評論家等等。編輯者就各方的來稿中，選出最精粹而適用稿子，編在這本册子裘，所以每個項目都由一個最適當的人來担任寫出最精粹的稿子，於是本書就成為音樂界獨步的作品。</p>
<p>音樂全書的性質和內容，當然屬於辭書一類，關於音樂方面的知識可以說是無所不包，非常完備。大體而論，我們可將它的內容分為三類（一）理論（二）歷史（三）傳記。關於理論及歷史方面，是比較呆板的材料，其叙述的流暢，說明的正確，當然是値得稱頌的。但我的着重點卻不是這些，而是關於最後一個項目，那就是音樂家的傳記。音樂作品和其他藝術一樣是作者思想輿感情的表現，他把精純的思想和感情灌注於樂曲之中使他的作品成為作者本人和聽衆之間的橋標。因此，音樂家的所思所惑會得到聽衆的共鳴要想眞正了解音樂作品的人，對於音樂家的傳記的確不可忽略，否則我們無從知道音樂家的個人生活，社會環境，思想背景等，這此是完成樂曲的決定因素。我們在這些傳記中更能獲悉音樂家創作樂曲時之心境，智慧，方法；他的作品是有獨創的風格呢還是模仿的；他的作品在當時的地位如何對於後代的影響又如何。以上種種知識對於音樂作品的了解和鏗賞，應有莫大的帮助。在這本音樂全書內的幾十篇傳記中，我們就可以看到上面所說的幾個要點，申說得簡潔而透澈，無論是音樂家音樂敎師或是普通聽衆只要對音樂眞有興趣的人，關讀這些傳記時，一定會得到精神的滿足。這些傳記的後面還附有簡單年譜和作品目錄，使讀者翻閱時感到格外的方便。還有一點値得提及的是：在傳記中有時用幾個字來標明音樂家的特點。例如，對於莫扎爾脫（Mozart）的作品，就用光明Brightness愉悅Gaity莊嚴Serenity三詞表明。這是何等中肯的斷語，任何一種莫氏的作品不綸是交響曲竸奏曲或是絃樂四重奏，我們不聽便罷，如有機緣聽得，光明愉悅莊嚴的曲風，立刻就會感到。—音樂全書之成為有價値的出版物，的確不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>假使國內的音樂敎育家能抽出一部份的時間，集體地來譯出這部名貴的書，對於不通革語的讀者（或聽者）當是一個極大的貢獻。</p>

<h3>幾何三大問題</h3>
<p>— 李沐孫</p>
<p>（克萊因著　余介石譯　商務版）</p>
<p>前些時盛傳着一個本市商店會計員楊嘉如君發明了幾何三大問題之一，三等分任意角之解法。確實令人驚異不已，許多報紙都引為中國數學之光。可是事實上高等數學已經告訴我們，這是不可能的，况且楊君的解法漏洞實在很多，譬如他說三等分點的軌跡竟是一個圓弧，然而我們都知道三等分點的軌跡就是三等分角綫，是直綫而不是其他的曲綫。</p>
<p>這一本「幾何三大問題」很詳細地討論幾何三大難題——即倍立方問題又稱德里問題（Delian　Rroblem日），三等分任意角問題，圓積問題——同時很淸楚地證明這三個問題的不可能解，而不是難解。他告訴我們用幾何方法作圖（即只許用圓規及直尺）所能解決的都是二次式，而這三個問題都是三次式，所以無論如何着手，是不可能的。除非是特別角，如平角，直角等。其實幾何難題何止三個，千萬個三次式的問題都不可解，都是難題。除了三大問題之外本書還討論到許多旁的有趣問題的解快如正十七邊形之作法，π之求快，e之超越性等。我敢說只要把本畫仔細讀一遍，定能對幾何發生極大的興趣。</p>
<p>本書作者克莢因敎授（Felix　Clein）是德國有名的數部敎授，他寫這本書的目的，不僅是討論幾何三大難題而已，他告訴我敬學無分代數，幾何，是息息相關的，因為這三個幾何問題，有幾千年不得解決，直到近世，由於解析方法的助力，才能證明牠們的不可能解決。</p>
<p>最後我告訴諸位讀者，本書是相當的高深，因為單憑初等數學的知識是絕對不够的，本書曾經引用高等代數，以及解析幾何等深奧的數學所以要讀這本書：第一，要有好的數學根基；第二，宜於精讀，而不宜於略讀，這樣才能收到「開卷有益」之效。</p>
<h3>醫師懺悔録</h3>
<p>— 微遠</p>
<p>魏列沙益夫著　枕江譯　開明版</p>
<p>有人曾經說過，醫師的對象是「病人」。是「病」和「人」，並不單就是「病」而已。那末，我說，「醫師懺悔錄」對這一些道理有非常深入，明確，而又爽朗的說明</p>
<p>道醫的內容，在卷頭譯者的「介紹著者的人格興作品」中有這樣一個間要的刻劃：「內容敍述他在醫科大學時代以及由大學而到社會上去做醫師的幾年生活間的觀察與體騐。由他的筆下可以窺知現代醫學的能力如何，醫師的程度如何，病人對於醫師的心理如何，社會對於醫師的能度如何，而醫師對於病的個人與社會又如何。他對於所有的事無不以慧眼靈心去觀察透澈考慮淸楚，而後對於病的社會，病的個人以及醫師以「所言公，公言之；所言私，王者無所私」的態度來把一面一面的黑幕一絲不掛地盡量揭聞，以使誰都能知道醫師，病人，社會間的複雜關係」。</p>
<p>大致說來，書的前半部份是寫作者怎樣跨入新醫學之門，怎樣在新醫學之門內接受了新醫學的洗體，怎樣認職了新醫學，怎樣努力從血與屍體中了解了新醫學等等。這些，我們祗要看「學生生活與醫科學生所見的社會」，「各種表病的痛苦」以及「對於醫學的褒獎與失望」與「醫學敎育的不完全」等章，就可知道作者正用了怎樣輕鬆而又經銳的筆調寫出了他在新醫學之門里所遭遇到的一切以及他的深入的觀察與思維所觸覺到，所看淸的不平凡的事。</p>
<p>在道里面作者到處流露着至情。有時我們會看得笑出來，一會兒我們的情感卻又跌倒在痛苦的氛開中了；有時候我們像迷失了津途，立刻我們卻又會找到了解答與去路</p>
<p>後半部份是寫作者在校門外的人羣里拿了他在學校星學到的一切去硬碰的一切了。這部份我以為還較前面部份値得看，看上去更能令人得到許多領悟：</p>
<p>別的不說，我們可先有這里面的「文明與人體」一章。作者除了舉了許多實例說明「人類當以享受文明的利益而不至破壞自然的結合為妙題」的這一事實外，附帶曾描寫過他自己的健康保特之道。他說他「一直到大學畢業那年為止，我每夏均營粗笨的勞動者生活，或耕或刈，或入山中伐木。深知由肌肉疲勞而來的幸福是什麼，狼吞虎噬是什麼，熟睡是怎樣的甘甜，風氣怎樣不足畏。就是今日，如果有往田野去的機會，我還是要帶着斧斤而去，非到了手皮硬化，體力强健，深感人生眞眞的快樂，作者巳寫出了醫師應對他以外的人寫的，或應付他周身的社會寫的一切中的主題了。雖然有的人可能不曾經騐到過那樣的事，但他不能不親自去體騐這一些。因為這些該是大家——不祗是大家的事。</p>
<p>另外的，我以為「婦女的羞恥與醫師」一童也寫得極好，這是其他地方很少看見的文字。對於「婦女的羞恥與女醫師」，作者正指給後行人一條待闢的路，一條重要的路。</p>
<p>末了是作者寫醫師與錢的幾章，這幾章我以為誰都應該一看。尤其是其中「醫師與病人間金錢的響聲」及「苛刻的醫師的義務」這幾章，我覺得正寫出了無數人的誤解，無數人的心聲，作者並不為醫師辯護，相反地，他正以超然的態度為窮人們辯獲，祗有對於食婪而又吝裔的權貴者才給了無情的滿斥。</p>
<p>這本書，作者的確別具隻眼的寫出了許多人們所常接觸而不曾想到過的事的深處，而他的筆調又如此微妙，不會令人感到自己正在看一本科學氣味極濃的書本。讀者祝枕江先生也正是道方面的巨子，所以這譯本能有這樣的完美，當然祝先生也是有莫大的關係的。</p>
<p>我敢推鷹這本書給：不曾看過它的醫師們，預備騐醫的未來醫師們。當然我更該推薦它給：任何一位在醫學圈外的人。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論新聞自由</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>此次國際新聞會議在日內瓦的迭次集會中，不使討論新聞本身的自由問題，且廣泛論及思想及思想與意思表示的自由，這誠是一個使全世界關懷自由之士感到興趣的問題。</p>
<p>記得巳故的美國羅斯福總統，曾將新聞自由列入人類四大自由之一，這確是羅斯福作為一個政治家的偉大處。因為時至今日，新聞事業對於人類生活的重要，巳為普遍公認的事賞，其對人世文明的影響，可說是在任何文化事業以上，所謂報紙是大衆的精神糧食，確非虛語。</p>
<p>但新聞事業對人類生活雖然其有重大的影響力，然其為功為罪，則至今仍為一個未決的問題，例如在此次日內瓦的新聞會議中，美國與蘇聯對於新聞事業的方針，均有提案。蘇聯主張凡一切屬於法西斯主義思想與鼓勵戰爭思想的新聞應予制止，絕對不得發表，而美國的提案則要求「制止凡足以增加仇恨或促成對國家個人或不同種族語言崇敎或哲學信仰團體，發生偏見之虛妄或歪曲報導之繼續官傳」。這兩個乍見似同而實則不同的提案，明眼人當知自各有其政治背景。但一般說來，都不外說明世界新聞事業迄今為止，猶無眞正的健全基礎。</p>
<p>所謂新聞自由，自然槪括思想的表現自由在內，因為新聞雖必須有事實為根據，而新聞的報導，則必須通過思想與意思的表現。關於人類思想與意思的表現，原不限於新聞工作，凡詩歌，文學，哲學，以及圖畫雕刻等造型藝術，都是人類思想與意思表現的工具或結晶。然而因為新聞事業的技術關係，與新聞事業有關的思想表現自由，才是今日一切思想表現自由的代表問題。</p>
<p>新聞旣是不能離開一定事實的根據，所謂新聞的思想表現自由，自亦有一定限度。思想自由云云，原不過是一種相對性的概念，思想自由的領域，祗能隨人的知性擴大而擴大。譬如愛因斯坦繼其相對論之後，最近對引力學興電子的關係又有新的發見。據一般科學家的意見，此項新學識對於未來世界將發生較原子能更重要的影響。可是迄日前為止，能懂得這種新學識的人，就是在高級的科學專家間亦不多。所以當愛因斯坦的思想領域雖已到達幾乎與宇雷本身相並駕的境界，一般人卻仍膛乎其後。這就是思想自由與知性閒相對關係的一個實證。</p>
<p>不過對於新聞的思想表現自由問題，當不能引此為搪詞。因為就現代人的知性言，雖不能說已高到如何，但如無外鑠條件的限制，人的思想與意思表現，是可能獲得自由發展的。現在所成問題者，就是怎樣能使新聞思想的表現自由，獲得合理的基礎。美國聯合社社長許貝烈氏於本月三日在日內瓦所致廣播詞中，曾謂此次國際新開會，正在爭取一關於新聞自由的大憲章，以作世界新聞事業的基礎。鄙人雖非新聞從業員，但頗希望此舉得獲成功。</p>
<p>新聞與思想表現的自由，目前雖有種種外在的阻力，不過最重要的還是在新聞從業員能提高其職業的道義與社會責任感。因為所謂思想表現自由云云，如已經說過的，其意義是相對的。表現兩字的本身就不是單純的技巧問題而是思想問題，一個知道怎樣在知性的進修中去拓展其思想境界的人，即不會認為外在的條件可能阻碍其思想的表現自由。因此爭取新聞與思想表現的自由，除了開拓外在的條件外，更重要的還是在拓展新聞從業員本身的知性境界。</p>
<p>我國代表張彭春博士在其向大會提出的建議中，有一條即是要求提高新聞職業的道義與社會責任，排斥商業主義與煽情主義，免除種族與宗敎的偏見，而從事正確，客觀與明瞭的報導工作，這些主張是無人能反對的，然而要做到此，則必須從加强新聞從業者的知性修養做起。</p>
<h3>杭州人看上海遊客</h3>
<p>— 耘耕</p>
<p>這幾天，上海遊客正像潮一般的一批又一批的湧進天堂裏，據警察局非正式的統計，每天至少有四萬以上的遊客逗留在這狹小的市區中心。對於這些遊客們，杭州的政府官吏與商阪苦力是無不竭誠表示歡迎之至的，因為上海遊客多數是偉大的消費者，他們不但直接使商販苦力增加收入，而且間接使政府稅收激增，從而解決了財政上的困難。所以有人說：上海遊客是幸福的，他們在杭州，除了置身於西子湖中，享受着薰薰湖風的陶醉外，還能博得杭州人士普遍的歡迎與羨慕。</p>
<p>但也並不完全如此，在杭州至少有二種人對上海遊客是表示着深痛而惡絕的；有一種人對上海遊客的到來則表示漠然無感，不知可否？</p>
<p>對上海遊客深表惡感的二種人裏，第一首推家庭主婦。這幾天物價還算平靜，但小菜塲裏的感覺卻似乎特別靈敏，不但魚蝦須要搶奪，而且平日售價尙穩的猪肉也大跳了一步，主婦們負賣廚房裏的進貨，這幾天小菜大漲，頗使她們進貨時感到棘手，因此遂把這種罪惡歸咎於這批臨時消費者—上海遊客的身上去。第二是一般薪水階級的公教人員，他們雖然則身於西子湖畔，但平日遊一次湖，上一次山的機會刦很少，大部份是困於經濟的關係。這一類人對上海客人並非不表歡迎，實際上是妒忌使他們發生了惡感。</p>
<p>另一類人，大槪屬於一般小小有產者階級的男人們，他們在生活上旣不直接受到因消費大量增加而小菜漲價的影響，因為這是妻子們的事情；同時也並不對上海遊客那種豪闊的神情表示妒忌，可是也不一定表示歡迎，大概的態度是：來也好，不來也好。</p>
<p>不過杭州人對上海遊客的態度雖有異別，而其中有一點看法是完全相同的，那就是有錢，豪關。幾乎任何一個杭州人都認為上海遊客是有錢的，而且錢多得可以使人驚嘆！至於豪闊，是因為有錢的關係，有錢的自然豪關，所以豪關表現在上海遊客身上似乎就不足為怪。</p>
<p>但也有不少人認為上海遊客的豪闊有點過份，所謂「過份」，意思就是做「洋盤」，其實有錢的暫時做洋盤原無所謂，正像撐划子的類：「先生，三冬靠一春，難得的」，因為難得，就暫時做一下「黃瓜」也好。不過一般杭州人都認為有時候大做黃瓜完全是不必要的，所謂入境問俗，杭州的民心究竟不惡，假使遊客們事先能對行·住·吃·遊預為打算，我們可以保證，某些地方決不會做「黃瓜」。</p>
<p>還有一點，上海人一定要在春天來遊西湖，似乎也沒有必要，雖然春天有種種理由足以誘惑遊客，但這時期遊山玩景必須擁擠在人海裏，吃的住的又都未必舒服。同時秋天裏的西湖景色如滿覺壠的桂花與西溪的蔗花也別具一番風趣，又何嘗不能陶醉遊客們的心襟。所以在杭人想來，上海遊客中何不分出一半俟秋凉後再來遊玩，豈不是使各一種分配上都可以得到平均。</p>

<p>保留對於一切事物慘疑的自由，切不要陷於任何「敎條」的圈套。—屠格涅夫</p>

<h3>偷天妙手</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>許多失踪了的財寳，不一定被埋在海底或者地下。也許它們就放在早已被人忘了的擱樓上的箱子中；也許它們就在眼前，不過隔了一重板罷了。看看有「美國寳藏偵探大王」之譽的福蘭見·夏雷德的經驗，便知「得來全不費功夫」之不虛。</p>
<p>有一個七十歲的老婦死在紐約的一幢公寓中，她的親戚們知道她有一筆可觀的遺產，可惜不知道藏在那裏。他們在小小的兩間公寓房子中翻箱倒籠的找了兩個月，還是毫無所獲。夏雷德被請來了，他祗花五分鐘功夫就發現了一隻破舊的衣箱中有一個秘密的抽屜，裏面藏着近五十萬元的現鈔。</p>
<p>夏雷德專門設計，製造，出售和修理箱子，積有三十多年的經騐。他也專精於尋覓傢具中的隱藏的抽屜和老房子中的秘密夾層。不久之前，有一個人想起他的家中有一盒華盛頓寫給他的祖先的信件，可是卻找不到藏在何處。夏雷德進了房子一打量之後，他覺得牆上所掛的畫有些蹊蹺，其中有一幀華盛頓像最為可疑。他將畫摘了下來，發現珍貴的信正藏在畫布與畫框之間。收藏家認為這紥信値兩萬五千元美金。</p>
<p>在戰爭時期，夏雷德做過一件特殊的事情。一位美國駐其中立國的大使於赴任途中曾下榻於紐約公園街某旅館。一個間諜跟蹤而至，他不但搜索過大使的房間，並且將行李間中其他旅客所寄放的一百五十多件行李的鎖都給撬開了。雖然他未曾偷竊甚麼東西，不過，旅館當局不願旅客知道逍件事，他們秘密的聘請夏雷德來擔任配鎖的工作。憑着一手高超的技藝，夏雷德居然使旅客一個人也不知道他們的鎖已被換新，眞可算是「愉天換日」的能手了。</p>

<h3>春遊</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>淸明節與散木游南翔，陌上烟冷，大異戰前。嗣訪古漪圍，垣舍皆燬，石亦剝蝕，如楠木廳及董香光「華嚴墨海」手蹟，徒供後人之憑弔而已。雖新建二亭，終不掩滿園荒落之氣象。余舊紀有句：「樹亦吁風多感慨，鴉如為客說滄桑。」今則春草不錄，何有於樹？</p>
<p>伶仃犢藝板橋旁，桃謝柳摧世已忘，三兩邱墳紙灰冷，六州面色菜花黃。誰能銷鐵化春雨？我亦無家依遠方。薦酒蒸豚前代事，如今人鬼各凄惶。</p>
<p>漫看花草避蒼生，布襪還宜短短程，一水全枯非秀野，此園雖小即蕪城；定知石墮三朝淚，無復鴉棲萬木聲！轉綠何年空結想，江南哀賦過蘭成。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十四章　逍遙海上（一二六）</p>
<p>潛齊倚在鐵欄杆上，靜看一回，忽聽背後有人呼嘯的聲音，回頭看時，有兩三個老頭子，手中拿着手杖，一面走一面張着嘴呼嘯，渚齋知道這般人都是衛生家，在公園迎日光，鍜鍊身體的，經他們一來，淸靜的境地，給不斷呼嘯的聲浪攪亂，渚齋便不願在此逗留，穿出古柏，一直走到集士林咖啡館門前，一望對面紅牆，花光照眼，沿牆下幾百株桃花，都巳開遍。精神不由為之一振，急步至桃花林下，細細賞玩，見樹上的桃花，含葩初放，嬌艷絕備，想起當日遇見綺紈，即在此地，綺紈臉上，那一雙酒渦，笑時的嬌媚，何異這桃花的嬌艷，現在花開仍舊，玉人巳去，一面想着，一面走到紅牆角，想當日自已在這裏吊嗓，遇見肖柏，由肖柏介紹綺紈，這一年來，心心相印，形影相依，不想今天南地北，人各一方，對此桃花，對此紅牆，大有人面不知何處去，桃花依舊笑東風之感，不勝惆悵，在桃林下，徘徊了好一會，心裏很想離開這傷心地，但是對此陳跡。又想重溫起心頭舊夢，徘徊依戀，只在桃林下，走來走去，不想走開，一時想到綺紈的小妹妹，一時又想到綺紈的小王媽，逍些都是當日結識綺紈的媒介，最後又想到當日我在這裏吊嗓，唱了一段玉堂春，現在好久沒有吊嗓了，不知嗓子怎麼樣，何不趁此早上，游人稀少，試一試嗓子，想着走進林中，仍找當日吊嗓的地點面對紅牆，引吭高歌，剛剛一段王堂春唱完，回過頭來，見有人在桃樹下對他哈哈大笑，渚齋一看，不是別人，正是肖柏姑丈，出於意外，肖柏一面笑着，一面向他招手，渚齋急走過去。肖柏笑道：「難得你又出來吊嗓了，我本想找你父親去，現在遇見你，我可省得走一趟，我告訴你一個好消息，綺紈在上海露演很順利的，她給我一封信，給你老太爺一封信，我本想把信親送過去，現在就交給你好了。」說着便取出兩封信，遞給渚齋，涔齊一聽綺紈有信，心裏早已突突跳動，也顧不了再和肖柏招呼，接過信急把牠展開一看。</p>
<h3>談陸徵祥（上）</h3>
<p>— 清雪學園</p>
<p>旣已記述山林氣之武人薩老將軍，更不可盃懸念外交界之奇人，蜚聲國際擔當多少大事，與中華國運最有關係之陸徵祥，子興（亦號子欣）先生。</p>
<p>他是「忠」之魁首，又是「奸」的班頭；國務總理，外交總長，特使公使折衝撙俎，民國十邵以前，全球知名的人物。近二十餘年無聲無臭，無影無踪；平巳投身比利時一價道院裏做了苦行的僧侶，世外閒人。眞吃苦眞隱遯，比其他一般的官僚軍閣之燒番念佛股汝耕，王揖廣，孫傳芳輩，誠偽之分，豈可以道理計哉？古語「神龍見首不見尾」，又說「絇爛之極歸於平淡」，這些話都不够形容他的獨特的品格與性行。</p>
<p>何以謂之「忠」之魁首乎？吾人須記憶一九一八年，巴黎和約日本要把接受總國山東權利，正式訂入約文，欺我國太甚，國內則有歷史性的「五四運動」，當時北京的舊官僚因怕日本，主張遷就的，固然很多；即國際形勢；因為日本在戰時早巳鬼鬼崇崇，與歐洲各國成立協定，同意她的繼承德國權利。以致美故威爾遜總統，都嘆惜，愛莫能助。但中國若俯首簽字立時成了一八九四年日俄戰後的期鮮（被日本包辦的國家），實是危險萬分。最後驚雷一聲，中國代表不簽字，不出席了！創「革命外交」之新紀元，使世界列强一新耳目，以後乃有華府會議，限令日本交還青島；及九國公約，打破日本包辦東方之迷夢，中國之國際地位，由此改觀。陸先生是歷史的偉人，毫無疑議。有人說內外多方面的努力，豈能歸功一人，這固然不錯，但須想想，陸氏所處是何等地位？本國代表國的領袖，特別外交大事之第一負責人，並非傀儡，更非「因人成事」。即使不是他的主張，而能察衆情，從羣議，其識量沉遠，意志堅定，亦是實至名歸。故曰「忠」之魁首。</p>
<p>何以謂之「奸」之班頭乎？一九一五（民國四年）日本提出的二十一條，是在佔領靑島，及山東路礦各種權利之後，進一步的壟斷全面中國利權，包辦東亞的嚴重要求。陸氏身為外交總畏，與倭使日置益談判數十次，卒因彼方提出哀的美敦書，而俯言簽約。全國憤激，定五月九日為空前之「國恥紀念日」，比二十一條為賣身契。證以倭人以後發動種種事變，則戰後巴黎和會席上顧維鈞博士演說二十一條是日本有意把中國當做高麗第二，確是實情。則親筆簽此條約的陸氏，在賣任上當然無可旁貸。或者又有人說當時上有袁世凱，下有曹陸等人，示意的示意，奔走的奔走。這些固然亦是事實，然而導是上面那句話，外交職權上正當的負實人，決不能看作傀儡，或無實任的君主之類。</p>
<h3>標題拾趣</h3>
<p>— 孫鴻</p>
<p>檢讀光結果三十六七年間之申報，細看其新聞題，饒有趣味。新聞題目多為固定的，以每一地名編成「詩意之句」為一總題，如「金台小誌」係京師通訊，「禹穴探奇」為紹興通訊，「鳩水文麟」為蕪湖通訊，「江淮放權」為安慶，「秦淮櫓唱」為南京，「鹿城客述」為溫州通信等等。蓋其時讀報人，與編報人同有試帖詩之經驗，故題目不妨如此錘鍊。最趣者，則某次揚州通訊忽標一新題日「騎鶴淸遊」，竟如送人帵幛矣。</p>

<h3>Chairman Visits National Assembly Hall, Listens to Entire Foreign Affairs Report, Wang Shijie Explains the Situation is Extremely Grave</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] Chairman Chiang visited the National Assembly Hall this morning for a short period of about one hour. The Chairman, dressed in military fatigues, arrived five minutes before the meeting started, sat in the presiding officer's seat, and left through a side door after listening to the foreign affairs report and a portion of the domestic affairs report. The time was 10:35 AM, and he was in the meeting hall for a total of one hour and fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The eighth session of the National Assembly was held at 9:25 AM on the fourteenth morning. 1587 representatives attended. The third group of the presidium was on duty, presided over by Chairman Chen Guang, who announced the opening of the meeting. After the secretariat presented a report, the day's agenda began with political reports. The ministers of foreign affairs, domestic affairs, education, and social affairs successively reported on the general situation of their administration. The meeting adjourned at 12:20 PM.</p>
<p>Minister Wang Shijie first reported on foreign affairs, specifically citing five points, which he explained separately:</p>
<p>First, World Peace and Our Country's Attitude: Wang stated, "The current situation is extremely grave. More than two years have passed since the end of World War II, but the victorious nations have yet to establish a common policy toward Germany and Japan, and thus a peace treaty with Germany and Japan has not been established. Therefore, China must continue to strive to promote the realization of all plans to strengthen the United Nations' power. Our position is: (1) to restrict the abuse of the veto power, (2) to promptly establish an international armed force in accordance with the United Nations Charter."</p>
<p>Second, Sino-American Relations: After the end of the war against Japan, the United States provided us with two major forms of assistance, namely assisting our government in sending two to three million Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents back to Japan, and assisting in transporting a large number of National Army troops to the Northeast and North China to carry out the reception work. As for our government's policy toward the United States, it is still to maintain and enhance the traditional friendship and cooperation between the two countries. The recent US loan to China aims to help our economy get on the road to stability. I will use it to offset the insufficiency of international payments and recover the legal tender, reduce issuance and help production.</p>
<p>Third, Sino-Soviet Relations and Others: China, based on the fact that the Sino-Soviet border is adjacent for thousands of kilometers, must be able to maintain a permanent peaceful and friendly relationship, and therefore concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. If it can be strictly implemented, China and the Soviet Union will surely be able to coexist in a friendly and peaceful manner.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Japan issue: Our country advocates severity in military matters and allowing the Japanese to achieve self-sufficiency in economic matters, in order to support a new, democratic Japan. At the time of the conclusion of the peace treaty, China will firmly advocate the establishment of a control mechanism.</p>
<p>Fifth, Protection of Overseas Chinese: The most basic task is to negotiate with various countries to conclude new treaties, so that overseas Chinese can receive equal treatment with other foreign residents under the new treaties.</p>
<p>Zhang Lisheng Reports on Domestic Affairs, Will Pay Special Attention to Local Autonomy Affairs in the Future</p>
<p>Minister Zhang Lisheng reported on domestic affairs, briefly explaining three points: one is the general situation of local autonomy work, one is the handling of various elections, and one is the protection of the basic rights of the people. Zhang first stated: "Since the closing of the National Assembly, the focus of domestic affairs work has been on preparing for constitutional governance. Regarding the issue of local autonomy, because all regions suffered greatly during the eight-year war of resistance, and some areas were limited by military suppression of bandits, it was not possible to promote it universally. However, it is estimated that the establishment of local public opinion organizations in various counties, townships, and towns has reached 80% of the total, and due to the supervision of public opinion organizations, considerable achievements have also been made in the governance of local affairs. In the future, special attention will be paid to local autonomy undertakings such as education, health, household registration, and land registration." Zhang then described the process of handling the election, and after reporting on the election process of supervisors and national representatives, he specially declared to the assembly his inescapable responsibility. He emphasized that "the biggest mistake I made in handling election affairs this time was overemphasizing the current cooperative relationship between parties, which caused some difficulties and unexpected troubles. I should bear this responsibility and do not expect forgiveness." When Zhang reported this point, he received some warm applause. The third is the protection of the basic rights of the people. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the Publication Law has been revised, and censorship of newspapers has been abolished. As for the issue of personal freedom, it belongs to the Police Headquarters. At present, police administration cannot be handled as perfectly as ideal, but in the future, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the people will obtain the rights they deserve, and it is hoped that representatives will return to their hometowns to guide the people in implementing the central government's policies and orders, work together to suppress the rebellion, and expect nation-building to be successful.</p>
<p>Education Report</p>
<p>When Zhu Jiahua reported on education, he first described some measures taken during the war, which were changed after the victory because they did not meet the needs of the environment. The education rehabilitation work was completed by the end of the 35th year according to the decision of the Education Rehabilitation Conference, but the rehabilitation fee was too small, and the handling was quite difficult. Zhu then reported on several important issues: (1) The number of schools and students has increased significantly after the war compared to before the war, but the number of students in elementary education has decreased due to the occupation and rebellion of the communist bandits. However, in terms of quality, there has been no progress, but it has declined due to the lack of teachers. (2) Basic education should be popularized as much as possible. In the first half of this year, 800 billion yuan was used to subsidize provinces and cities to handle basic education, which is being carefully allocated to make it fair and reasonable in order to achieve results. (3) Educational funding is tight. In the first half of this year, it accounted for 12% of the budget, more than half of which was used for student meals and teachers' salaries. Teachers' salaries are listed alongside civil servants, and the Ministry of Education can only care about them. (4) The Relief Committee for Unemployed and Out-of-School Youth will continue to handle the relief of unemployed and out-of-school youth, and it is hoped that the provinces and cities will handle it themselves in the future, with the central government coordinating funding. (5) Recently, the academic atmosphere has been sluggish for many reasons, which is unavoidable. However, the biggest problem is the incitement of the Communist Party. The Ministry of Education pays close attention to this and will never condone it. It is also hoped that representatives and social forces will assist in reversing the decline.</p>
<p>Social Report</p>
<p>Gu Zhenggang's social report is divided into three sections: (1) Refugee Relief: After Gu reported on the guiding principles, methods, and implementation situation, he pointed out that the relief funds allocated by the government could not be described as a drop in the bucket, but rather as a goose feather from a thousand miles away. In the future, improvements will focus on increasing sources of relief funds. In addition to hoping for assistance from friendly countries, special attention will be paid to soliciting donations for special relief. (2) Labor Situation: Gu stated that the Ministry of Social Affairs is implementing leadership in three areas: improving the lives of workers, eliminating labor-management disputes, and supporting workers' participation in politics. There are currently 5 million organized workers, and they are the greatest force in combating the Communist Party. (3) Supporting the development of vocational groups: Based on the spirit of freedom and democracy in the Constitution, the Ministry of Social Affairs has revised various laws and regulations, strengthened the grassroots organizations of various groups, and guided the establishment of national organizations and enriched them. There has been progress in recent years. In terms of numbers, there are currently 7,171 vocational groups nationwide, with 11,6309 group members and 28,378,004 individual members, and their leaders are all professionals in their respective fields.</p>
<h3>Presidium Meeting</h3>
<p>Today's Agenda Submitted to the Assembly for Research</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The National Assembly Presidium held a meeting at 8 PM on the fourteenth. Chairman Pan Gongzhan reported on the process of receiving petitioners from Anhui students of major and secondary schools, and decided to send it to the National Government for handling. Then, they began discussions and decided that the chairman of the ninth session of the assembly on the fifteenth would be He Chengjun in the morning and Zhu Jiahua in the afternoon. The conveners of the seven review committees were also designated by the presidium, with five to nine people in each group, and submitted to the assembly for decision. Regarding the agenda of the assembly on the fifteenth, because some representatives requested to continue the political and economic review, the meeting discussed it for a long time and did not reach a conclusion. Because the Executive Yuan will hold a meeting on the fifteenth, if the political and economic review continues, it will be difficult for the heads of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan to attend the assembly to listen. If the constitutional amendment is discussed according to the original agenda, it is feared that the representatives will oppose it. Finally, it was decided to submit it to the assembly for research on the fifteenth. If the review is not continued in the morning, the constitutional amendment will be discussed, and the review will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Government Prepares to Authorize Security Agencies to Adopt Measures to Stop Riots to Ensure Social Order and the People's Lives and Property</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] Military News Agency Dispatch: According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense: The Communist bandits control their occupied areas with severe punishments, using terror and massacre to coerce the people to participate in the rebellion, while taking advantage of the free environment in the government area to organize underground work, engage in espionage activities, and develop various riotous behaviors through strikes, work stoppages, parades, and demonstrations, responding to their wandering and expanding their rebellious behavior. Based on the reports of surrendered bandits regarding the above situation, the government, in order to ensure social order and the lives and property of the people, will, when necessary, authorize local garrison, police, security, and other security agencies to adopt measures to stop riots in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Review of Politics and Economy, Most Speakers Criticize the Government's Improper Administration, Xinjiang and Mongolian Representatives Demand Attention to Border Administration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The eighth session of the National Assembly continued at 3:40 PM on the fourteenth. 1541 representatives attended. The fourth group of the presidium was on duty, presided over by Chairman Chen Lianfen, who announced the opening of the meeting. After the announcement, a review of politics and economy was conducted. The chairman first proposed that because there were so many people requesting to speak, could each unit send one or two representatives to speak in order to expedite the meeting? However, after representatives raised objections, speeches were still given individually in the order of the speech slips. By 6 PM, a total of 15 people had spoken. Except for one representative from Taiwan Province, the rest were all representatives from the north, and four representatives from Xinjiang and Mongolia spoke. What was particularly notable today was that a farmer representative from Shanxi also spoke. By the statutory adjournment time of 6 PM, there were still more than 300 people requesting to speak. Although the chairman announced that the unfinished agenda for today's review would be continued on the morning of the 18th, the representatives from the north were emotionally agitated and did not want the agenda to be interrupted, which caused some commotion in the meeting hall.</p>
<p>In today's speeches, most representatives criticized the current government's improper administration, especially the border representatives who repeatedly criticized the government's neglect of the border. Mongolian representative Duoduo Bo stated: "In the government's administrative reports heard in recent days, not a single word was mentioned about Mongolia, and the Mongolian autonomy plan has been drafted, but the government has violated the provisions of the Constitution and has not completed the legislative procedures." Zaqisqin said: "The government has opened the door, and the Mongolians will definitely come in. The government's failure to subsidize Mongolian funding and the lack of political openness are extremely unreasonable." Xinjiang representative Mutiyi said: "Our compatriots in Xinjiang are all proud to be citizens of the Republic of China, but the government neglects the border so much, and the government is based on people, and changes one person and changes one method. In this way, the Xinjiang problem cannot be solved. I hope the central government will formulate a permanent border ethnic policy, with rights and obligations stipulated one by one, and the government and the people will abide by it." Tu Legan hoped that the government could establish a border ministry to specifically manage various issues such as border education and culture. Representatives from the Northeast unanimously criticized the economic problems, namely the circulation voucher problem, satirizing Zhang Jiaao's measures during his tenure as chairman of the Northeast Economic Commission as "virtuous governance", and demanding that Zhang Jiaao attend the meeting to report and answer questions. They also stated that "the people of the Northeast do not want anything special. We are all Chinese." Yang Zhiping from Liaobei hoped that the government would welcome public criticism, acknowledge criticism, and be brave in correcting mistakes. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Farmer Representative Speaks for the First Time, Meeting Hall Applauds Warmly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] He Min, the Shanxi representative elected as a farmer, spoke at the eighth session of the National Assembly on the afternoon of the fourteenth. This was the first time a farmer had spoken at the meeting. He was dressed simply, wearing a set of Chinese-style jacket and trousers. His speech was also extremely simple. He said, "I am a farmer representative. I don't know how to speak. No one has ever spoken for us farmers. No one knows our farmers' pain. I only know that we farmers don't even have seeds for planting. I really can't take it anymore." After speaking, he bowed and stepped down from the stage. Before and after He Min stepped onto the stage, all the representatives gave him long and enthusiastic applause.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi Publishes Comparative Table, Believes the Constitution Should Not Be Amended</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The National Assembly Presidium has included the issue of amending the Constitution on the agenda for the fifteenth, which is one of the most important issues since the opening of the National Assembly. Zeng Qi, the leader of the Chinese Youth Party, recently published his handwritten "Comparative Table of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Maintaining the Constitution and Amending the Constitution." The original table is as follows: (A) Advantages of Maintaining the Constitution: (1) It can show the determination to implement constitutional governance, (2) It can demonstrate great credibility to the world, (3) It can protect the positions of the three parties, (4) It can block the mouths of the Communist Party. (B) Disadvantages of Amending the Constitution: (1) Amending it before it is implemented is inexplicable, (2) The articles are complicated and easily lead to disputes, (3) Past efforts will be misunderstood, (4) Changing from plaintiff to defendant gives the Communist bandits an excuse and causes doubts at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Representatives Propose Recalling Ryukyu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] All 29 representatives from Taiwan have submitted a proposal to the National Assembly requesting the government to recall Ryukyu. The contents of the proposal will be released to reporters in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Mo Dehui et al. Propose the Enactment of Provisional Regulations, Giving the President Emergency Powers, So That He Can Adapt to the Times During the Period of Rebellion Suppression. Proposals Related to Constitutional Amendments Were Closed Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] During the period of rebellion suppression, in order to ensure that all government measures are effectively responsible in order to adapt to the times, National Representative Mo Dehui and 721 others specifically proposed the "Enactment of Provisional Regulations During the Period of Mobilization for Rebellion Suppression." The content of the draft regulations is as follows:</p>
<p>Now, in accordance with the procedures of Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, the Provisional Regulations During the Period of Mobilization for Rebellion Suppression are hereby enacted as follows:</p>
<p>During the period of mobilization for rebellion suppression, the President, in order to avoid national or people's emergency distress or to cope with major financial and economic changes, may, after the resolution of the Executive Yuan, take emergency measures, without being restricted by the procedures stipulated in Article 39 or Article 43 of the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan may change or cancel the aforementioned emergency measures in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution. The termination of the period of mobilization for rebellion suppression shall be announced by the President or by the Legislative Yuan requesting the President to announce it. In addition, National Representative Zhang Zhiben and others, in view of the fact that the Constitution only stipulates the President's authority to issue emergency orders in the event of natural disasters, epidemics, or national emergencies, if internal disturbances occur, even if there is a need for rapid disposition due to the mobilization for rebellion suppression, this order may not be issued, which is not sufficient to meet the country's emergency needs. They specifically proposed that "the assembly resolve that the President may issue emergency orders due to mobilization for rebellion suppression in order to meet the needs of the country." The content also stated that the order must be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within two months after its issuance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] The deadline for receiving proposals related to constitutional amendments in the National Assembly was noon on the fourteenth. Seventeen proposals have been submitted.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Anhui Students Petition the National Assembly, Demanding the Replacement of Li Pinxian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] Hundreds of Anhui students from major and secondary schools in Nanjing demanded that the government replace Anhui Chairman Li Pinxian. This afternoon, they went to the National Assembly to petition. The presidium appointed representatives Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuxiu, and Sun Yafu to receive them. Pan stated that he would convey the students' opinions to the presidium and send the opinion letter to the representatives. The students began to leave in formation at about 6 PM, still chanting slogans along the way to overthrow Li Pinxian.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Letter to the US President, McNutt Has Presented it to the White House, Truman Reports to Congress on Our Food Rationing Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] McNutt, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the United China Relief Association, who recently returned to the United States from China, met with President Truman today and presented letters from Chairman Chiang and Philippine President Roxas. Reporters waiting at the White House asked McNutt what he discussed with the President and the contents of the two letters. McNutt declined to answer.</p>
<p>[US Information Service Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] President Truman stated in a report to Congress today: China's first complete food rationing plan is now being supported by American relief supplies under a plan jointly managed by Chinese and American officials. The plan was implemented on March 1 in five major metropolitan centers including Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Specific plans were drawn up in advance to properly store American relief supplies and then distribute them monthly at fixed prices, so that people at all levels could benefit. The approval of additional funding for China under the Foreign Aid Act signed by President Truman on April 3 is expected to guarantee the continued flow of relief supplies to China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] President Truman submitted a report to Congress on the thirteenth, reporting on the progress of foreign aid up to the end of 1947, stating that all supplies purchased for China under the Relief Act after the UNRRA concluded in May last year and the Interim Relief Act in December last year will arrive in China in the early summer of 1948.</p>
<h3>Luo Zhuoying, Zhao Jiaxiang, and Others Report to the National Assembly One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] After Luo Zhuoying, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, arrived in Nanjing, he reported to the National Assembly. Luo also visited Bai Chongxi at 8:30 PM on the fourteenth to report on the situation in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>New Jiangxi Provincial Chairman Hu Jiafeng Takes Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang Fourteenth Dispatch] Hu Jiafeng took office as the chairman of Jiangxi Province today. Song Xiangcheng, the former Secretary-General, handled the handover for the former chairman Wang Lingji. Hu then convened his subordinates, expressing his governing principles for Jiangxi, and urged them to jointly abide by the three major creeds of (1) establishing political ethics, (2) being cautious in selecting personnel, and (3) respecting laws and disciplines.</p>
<h3>National Army in Zhengzhou Launches Full-Scale Offensive, Sweeping the Periphery Horizontally and Vertically. Order in the City is Quickly Restored. Communist Bandits on the Pinghan Railway Continue to Flee Westward</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaifeng Fourteenth Dispatch] The elite National Army and rapid units in Zhengzhou launched a full-scale offensive today, sweeping away the remaining bandits in the periphery horizontally and vertically. Order in the city has been quickly restored. There are no more traces of bandits in the entire territory of Guangwu. There are also only a few scattered bandits active between Rongyang and Fanshui and in Meishan and Qinshan, 40 miles southwest of Zhengzhou, and they will be cleared up within days. The main force of the bandit army is currently gathered west of the Guodian-Xinzheng highway and in Mi County, and it is reported that it has begun to move southwest.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A part of the bandit army east of Luoyang recently fled westward through the Heishiguan Bridge west of Gong County, inquiring along the way about the distance from Luoyang to Hengshui and from Hengshui to the south bank of the Yellow River, seemingly intending to cross north.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Fourteenth Dispatch] Liu's bandit brigades 1, 2, 3, 6, and 11 were intercepted into two groups in eastern Henan by the National Army's courageous pursuit and fierce annihilation. Liu's bandit brigades 2, 3, and 6 have fled west across the Pinghan Railway. A part fled to Wuyang yesterday, and a part fled to Shahedian from Yifengdian, seemingly continuing to flee northwest. Liu's bandit brigades 1 and 11 were intercepted by the National Army's Qiu Qingquan unit near Qixian and Suixian. After days of heavy blows, casualties were quite heavy. Yesterday, they fled north across the Longhai Railway from the Yejigang area of Neihuang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Fourteenth Dispatch] Liu's bandits brigades 2, 3, and 6 and the remnants of Chen's bandit brigade 10, who had fled to the Sui Ping, Xiping, and Yancheng areas on the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province, were unable to stand their ground due to the pincer attack from the north and south by the National Army. Yesterday, they began to flee westward to the Funiu Mountains. The National Army is pursuing fiercely between Chuanyang and Biyang. (There are more suppression and annihilation battle reports on page two)</p>
<h3>Henan National Representatives Submit Letter to the Chairman, Demanding the Dispatch of Troops for Clearing Operations Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] All Henan National Representatives, Zhang Fang and more than 100 others, drafted a letter to Chairman Chiang, which will be presented to the Chairman within one or two days, requesting three things: (1) There are too few troops stationed in Henan Province now, which is insufficient for guarding points and powerless for chasing and suppressing, only allowing the treacherous bandits to grow stronger. Please dispatch five reorganized National Army corps to do their best to pursue and eliminate them within a time limit, and unify command and strictly enforce military discipline. (2) The Henan Provincial Security Forces had previously requested and been approved by your office for five brigades, and approved for the allocation of 80% of weapons and ammunition. Half a year has passed, but they have not yet been received. Please order them to be allocated quickly according to the approved number. (3) The civilian armed forces in Henan Province have suffered great losses due to the attacks of bandit field armies one after another. Please allocate 10 million rounds of ammunition to supplement the civilian teams.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Proceedings: Listening to the People's Voices Through National Representatives</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] "Chairman! Chairman! An emergency motion! The political and economic review needs to be extended and continued tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Chairman, my request to speak was submitted to the podium early yesterday morning. Why am I still not allowed to speak?"</p>
<p>"Chairman! Chairman!" The afternoon session on the 14th ended in chaos, but a small group of representatives swarmed the podium again because they hadn't noticed that the meeting on the 13th had already passed a motion to combine the economic review with the political review on the 14th, and if time was insufficient, it would continue on the morning of the 18th (Sunday). The Chairman was extremely nervous, and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou held the meeting minutes and rules of procedure, but couldn't reason with them. Chairman Chen Lianfen saw that the situation was not right and slipped away, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>In recent days, the government's boilerplate reports didn't seem to attract much attention. Everyone was using the review as an opportunity to speak for themselves. But despite the reviews, the meeting hall was always sparsely populated during the afternoon review sessions. After today's recess, the number of attendees was at most only about a thousand.</p>
<p>Nearly two hundred people wanted to review the economic and political policy reports. From the speeches of fifteen people on the afternoon of the 14th, we can already see some of the sentiments of the people. Representatives from the neglected border regions made appeals. Representatives from the economically strangled Northeast lodged protests. Representatives from the recovered areas painfully accused the corrupt officials in charge of the takeover. The general consensus was to punish corrupt officials, and some even proposed using the funds that had fled to the United States to help suppress the rebellion. He Min, a farmer representative from Shanxi, was a genuine peasant. He said, "There are no seeds to plant." Zhao Yongfu from Shandong severely criticized the factional infighting that was ruining the country. Except for the first representative, whose life was special and who spoke incoherently and was booed off, the quick-witted remarks of the other fourteen representatives were greeted with enthusiastic applause from the representatives in the hall, while the government officials in the audience remained silent.</p>
<p>The Mongolian representatives Duo Duobo and Zaqisqin were both outstanding speakers. Duo Duobo accused the central government of failing to fulfill its promises regarding the autonomy of the leagues and banners of Mongolia, saying that the Executive Yuan's delay in the legislative process for the draft law on local autonomy of leagues and banners prepared by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was deception and a breach of the constitution. Zaqisqin questioned why there was no border administration report? Why wasn't the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission given real power? He questioned how much money the state had spent on border construction, education, and relief.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang representatives Mutiyi and Tu Legan both emphasized unity. They said that in the reports of the government ministers, they didn't even hear the term "border region." Mutiyi first asked if the area outside the Great Wall was Chinese territory. Then he accused Wu Zhongxin of neglecting the ethnic factors of Xinjiang's politics and society. Fortunately, Zhang Zhizhong's enlightened policies and outstanding achievements had won back the hearts of the people. He said, "The people of Xinjiang are worried that General Zhang will not always be in charge of Xinjiang. Once he leaves, what will happen when someone else takes over? We ask the central government to have a permanent border ethnic policy to give everyone confidence and comfort."</p>
<p>Chuan Zhengda, the Yi representative from Xikang, said, "The Yi people in the southwest have 300,000 rifles. Why doesn't the government organize, train, and reuse them to defend the southwest?"</p>
<p>Xie Zhengqiang, a representative from Taiwan, shouted, "Does the government want Taiwan or not? Does it want Taiwan or not!" He said that the order in Taiwan had been completely destroyed. He protested against the special treatment of people from the mainland, which made the people of Taiwan feel like they were still in a colony. The promises made by Minister Bai during his visit to comfort them had not come true, but the people of Taiwan would never demand independence, nor would they demand trusteeship. "Taiwan will always be China's, and the hearts of the people of Taiwan are with the motherland!"</p>
<p>Lin Naishan and Yang Zhiping, representatives from the Northeast, emphasized that the economy of the Northeast was ten times more serious than the military situation. Lin Naishan said that the legal tender and Ji military notes stamped by Du Weiming were not being exchanged by Zhang Jiaao. The amount of currency in circulation exceeded 5 trillion (equivalent to nearly 60 trillion legal tender at the official rate), making it akin to ghost money and waste paper. He said, "This is all thanks to Mr. Zhang Jiaao's virtuous governance. Our only request is that the currency in circulation be allowed to enter the customs at the official rate of 11.5 to 1. The people of the Northeast are eating soybean cakes and pig food. We are also Chinese people. Why are you using this special method to trap us outside the customs, starving us to death!

<h3>Editorial: The First Round of the Cold War in the Americas</h3>
<p>While the Pan-American Conference is holding important discussions in Bogotá, a "red coup" suddenly occurred in Colombia, which not only aroused the world's attention to the future development of the Colombian political situation, but also aroused deep concern about the safety of Secretary of State Marshall and the continuation of the Pan-American Conference. In the past few days, the "red coup" plan has failed, and the joint new government organized by the Liberal and Conservative parties has been formally established; at the same time, the Pan-American Conference is still continuing there. On the surface, this turmoil can be quelled here; but from another perspective, the Cold War engaged in by the United States and the Soviet Union has spread from Europe and Asia to South America. The coup in Colombia was just the first round of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in South America.</p>
<p>The reason is that after the coup in Colombia, the government and the public of the United States and Colombia unanimously believed that this was a conspiracy by the Communist Party to undermine the Pan-American Conference. Therefore, as soon as the new Colombian government was proclaimed, it immediately announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union on the grounds that the Communist Party participated in the riots; at the same time, Secretary of State Marshall also openly condemned the Communist Party's attempt to incite world revolution to representatives of various countries. He said, "The Colombian coup is actually the same type of event as inciting strikes in countries such as France and Italy and attempting to hinder the Italian elections. When we take action here, we must understand that this event is a world event, not just limited to Colombia or Latin America. The Communist Party deliberately instigated the coup in order to undermine the Pan-American Conference, so as to embarrass the Western Hemisphere and thus affect the Italian elections in April." From Secretary Marshall's brief remarks, it can also be seen that the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union has spread from Europe and Asia to South America. The coup in Colombia is just the first step in the other side's launch of the Cold War in South America; Chile and Bolivia and other countries have the possibility of similar coups. Recently, rumors have filled the city of Chile, saying that the Communist Party will launch a coup on May 1, with a great atmosphere of panic, so that the Chilean authorities have to take emergency national defense measures to prevent the Communist Party from launching a coup.</p>
<p>The US authorities have always attached great importance to this Pan-American Conference. Secretary of State Marshall personally went to participate, holding the motivation of "we must first settle the domestic affairs before resisting foreign aggression," requesting the countries of the Western Hemisphere to strengthen unity, implement joint defense, and unanimously resist foreign aggression. Therefore, the main agenda of this conference is: one is to establish a Permanent American Defense Committee to implement the Pan-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance established last year; the second is to sign a Pan-American Economic Cooperation Agreement; and the third is to establish a Pan-American Peace System. From this, we can know that the task of this Pan-American Conference is actually very important, no less than the basis for the United States to engage in the Cold War with the Soviet Union in Europe. Therefore, from the Soviet Union's point of view, it believes that the United States is attempting to strengthen its political, economic, and military control over the countries of South America through the Pan-American Conference, so it cannot avoid having a conspiracy to undermine the Pan-American Conference, and instigating a coup in Colombia is naturally a powerful counterattack by the Soviet Union against the United States. At the opening of the Pan-American Conference, we had already pointed out that the representatives of the 21 countries in the Americas were frightened by the crisis of the Communist forces infiltrating all parts of the world, and they were even more convinced that the Western Hemisphere needed to cooperate closely to strengthen ties; and we predicted that this conference would definitely achieve satisfactory results. Now, affected by the coup in Colombia, the conference was once suspended, and whether it can be concluded as scheduled has indeed become a problem. But from another perspective: the coup in Colombia made the representatives of the 21 countries feel the terror of the red color, everyone personally witnessed it, and everyone was shocked, deeply feeling the threat of the Communist forces, which is bound to further promote their unity.</p>
<p>But the greatest significance of the coup in Colombia is to give Secretary of State Marshall a blow to the head, making him realize that the opposition of the two worlds does not have a geographical demarcation line, dividing the two worlds clearly. As in Europe, there is a distinction between Eastern Europe and Western Europe; and the Communist forces are like mercury leaking to the ground, infiltrating everywhere. In any corner of today's world, there are Communist forces lurking, which can appear at any time and struggle at any time. Europe is like this, Asia is like this, and even in the Americas, it is like this. Secretary of State Marshall only saw the crisis in Europe, and neglected the threat of Communist forces in other places, stubbornly adhering to his "Europe First" policy, unwilling to change it slightly. We believe that the US government will sooner or later recast historical mistakes. We deeply hope that Secretary Marshall can accept the lesson of the coup in Colombia, thoroughly review the current diplomatic policy, broaden his horizons, take charge of the overall situation, and make wise decisions early to save the world from collapse!</p>
<p>Secondly, we stand in the position of a third party, looking at the Cold War being waged by the United States and the Soviet Union with a cold eye. We only see that the Soviet Union acts quickly, has clever methods, takes the initiative everywhere, and takes every step first. Whether in Europe or Asia, it has already been in an unshakable position; moreover, the Soviet Union is not satisfied with this. In Europe, the Soviet Union is trying to move its curtain towards the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, and there will be amazing actions for the Italian elections in April and the French elections in May; for Germany, it will use the German people's dissatisfaction with the British and Americans to launch an anti-British and anti-American movement in East Germany, West Germany, and Berlin. Not to mention this in Asia, the Soviet Union has long been prepared for Korea, and it is constantly providing assistance to the Chinese Communist Party. Southeast Asia already has the organization of the Communist International. But looking back at the United States, we only hear a cry of anti-communism, but we do not see actual and effective actions. A year ago, we had already heard the advocacy of the Truman Doctrine and the promotion of the Marshall Plan, but what has the United States done in the past year? No one can help but express doubts; President Truman was stimulated by the Czech coup, and only then did he express that his confidence in world peace had begun to waver, and only then did he advocate that the United States should implement conscription and universal military training. It is an undeniable fact that the US authorities lack foresight and foresight for the post-war world. Even today, the "utopia" Western Hemisphere where the United States is located has felt the threat of Communist forces. Although the coup in Colombia has been exposed, who can guarantee that the same coup will not occur in other South American countries! Therefore, the coup in Colombia is the first round of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Americas, no less than a serious warning to the US government and the public, so that they can no longer decorate the world in peace, and they must pay special attention to the current international crisis.</p>

So far, the judgment has been returned for retrial.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin, 13th] Wang Caiqing, a villager in Nanxiang Township, over fifty years old, obtained a river oyster in the early years of the Republic of China, as large as a human palm. When it was dissected for food, red blood overflowed, which was quite strange. When it was opened, five Buddha statues were found on each of the two shell walls, protruding like relief sculptures, with extremely clear eyebrows, eyes, hands, and feet. Wang was surprised and treasured it, treating it like a priceless treasure, and kept it a secret from others. Recently, it was learned by his relative, Director Pan of the Household Affairs Section of the County Government, who strongly urged him to hold a public exhibition in the People's Education Museum of the park, and to use all the ticket income to aid refugees. In recent days, it has caused a sensation in the city, and visitors have flocked to see it.

<h3>The Story of the Relief of Zhuoyang</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent on the Central China Battlefield, Bu Mian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Fuyang, 11th] Fuyang, formerly Yingzhou Prefecture, is located at the intersection of the Ying and Shang rivers, a major transportation route in Henan and Anhui, and the largest city in northern Anhui. In history, it has already written a glorious chapter. This time, the two bandits Liu and Chen gathered a crowd of 80,000, claiming that they would capture Fuyang within three days. As a result, they not only failed to enter the city, but were defeated by the National Army and routed. If our memory of history is not too bad, we should remember that during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty, Liu Qi once used 40,000 troops to defeat the invading army of Jin Wuzhu, which numbered hundreds of thousands. Today's victory in Fuyang is somewhat similar.</p>
<p>Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 11th divisions, and Chen Yi's 10th Column, the four regiments of Jin Shaoshan's Independent Brigade, and Wei Fenglou's Independent Brigade, totaling more than 80,000 men, carrying three days' worth of rations, were led by Liu Fei himself as the chief commander to invade Fuyang. They launched a full-scale siege offensive at 12:00 midnight on the 29th, besieging the eastern, southern, and western suburbs of Fuyang. Our defending troops, under the command of Commander Li, calmly responded to the battle and bravely fought back. At dawn on the 30th, the main force of Jin Fei's Independent Brigade attacked the western suburbs alone, while its main force still attacked the eastern, southern, and northern suburbs. Our air force squadrons dispatched and assisted in the battle from the air. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was frustrated. Their morale was depressed, and they immediately stopped their fierce offensive to adjust their forces and redeploy. On the one hand, they continued to reinforce and prepare to counterattack again.</p>
<p>At 11:00 a.m. on the 30th, the bandit reinforcements were discovered in the Lixianpu, Majiadian, and Chahuamiao areas of the Fuyang-Mengcheng Highway. Our westward advancing troops of the Qiu Division immediately intercepted them. In the evening, the bandits first used two companies to launch a fierce attack on the suburbs of the city as a probing attack. After a slight resistance from our army, they retreated. They then launched a large-scale offensive, concentrating their forces on one point, and fiercely battled in the Dongguan area. One of the most advantageous units of our Qiu Weida Division, despite being outnumbered, still firmly defended its position and vowed to resist to the death. Dongguan was lost and regained three times, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties. This was the highest point of the battle's progress.</p>
<p>After suffering this blow, the bandits' attempt to besiege Zhuoyang was invisibly shaken. In order to save "face" and fulfill his promise to capture Fuyang in three days, Liu Fei still made a desperate gamble. At dawn on the 31st, the bandits bombarded our city walls with mountain artillery and used the firepower of heavy weapons as cover to continue attacking the strongholds in the northeast pass. Our army also used a dense network of fire to prevent the bandit army from advancing. The two sides were in a stalemate. The bandits, whose offensive was blocked and who were in a dilemma whether to advance or retreat, did not hesitate to make major sacrifices and implemented "human wave tactics" to break through the strongholds in the northeast. However, after dawn, our air force flew over the area and dropped dozens of bombs, and the strongholds were recovered again. Until 10:00 p.m., the bandit army launched a third assault. The artillery positions (more than a dozen mountain guns) in the suburbs northwest and north pass, west pass, Dongyue Temple, Sanliyuan, and other places continuously bombarded us to cover their advance. The bandits attacked the north pass fiercely. Before long, the bandits at the Guandi Temple and the Wenfeng Pagoda outside the east pass and the Dandanchang outside the west pass used signal flares and Russian-made command guns as guidance, and used smoke screens and heavy fire to cover their repeated attacks. Our defending troops still firmly defended their positions and made a desperate resistance. The fighting was particularly fierce outside the east pass and the southeast corner, the Wenfeng Pagoda, the north pass, and the northeast corner. After a night of fierce fighting, the embankment outside the east pass was destroyed by bandit artillery fire. Our army made its best efforts and bravely fought for it several times, but it was ultimately outnumbered. By 6:00 a.m. on the 1st, our army automatically cleared the firing range and moved the position in the east pass to continue blocking. The bandits used the cover of powerful artillery fire to approach our position and used landmine explosions to destroy the obstacles in our position. The defending troops fought bloody battles and, at a great price, abandoned the Wenfeng Pagoda, but all the other positions were still in our hands.</p>
<p>When the opening battle of Fuyang was unveiled, the elite corps of our Yu Nan Commander Zhang rushed to the north for reinforcements in heavy rain. At the height of the siege of Fuyang on the 31st, General Zhang, with lightning speed, crossed the Hong River from Fangjiaji, Zhao Ji, and Ma Lidian. The bandit army was overwhelmed by the wind and fled like a broken bamboo. The next day, it advanced to Gongliqiao and Xieji. The bandits' rear and flanks were under serious threat. If they continued to besiege Fuyang, they would all be annihilated in the suburbs of Fuyang. At the same time, the bandit's 36th Column was also ambushed by Zhang's troops, suffering heavy casualties. The siege of Fuyang was lifted. In this battle, the bandits suffered more than 10,000 casualties, more than 1,000 were captured, and a large number of spoils were seized.</p>
<p>The siege of Fuyang has been lifted. Although it has gone through four days of tension, it has returned to its tranquility and peace.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Rejects the Return of Trieste to Italy; British Warships Arrive in Trieste to Prevent Disturbances</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 14th Broadcast: Trieste message, the situation here is very tense after the Soviet Union announced its rejection of the Anglo-American proposal to return Trieste to Italy. The Communist-controlled Labor Union held a special meeting, which is expected to obstruct pro-Italian demonstrations. The special work call issued at midnight yesterday has had an impact. Most shops and bakeries have been closed, except for military bases, hospitals, and charitable institutions. Italian newspapers in Trieste published the news of the Soviet Union's rejection of the Anglo-American proposal with the headline "Now We Must Know Who Italy's Enemies Are." Police have taken alert measures to prevent conflicts. In addition, the British aircraft carrier "Victorious" arrived in Trieste escorted by the destroyer "Cheviot" from Venice.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 13th] Moscow Radio broadcast tonight that the Soviet Union has submitted a note to the United States, Britain, and France, rejecting the three countries' proposal to convene a four-nation conference to discuss the issue of returning Trieste to Italy. The Soviet Union believes that the designation of Trieste as a free zone is stipulated in the Italian Peace Treaty, which was drafted by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and signed by 21 countries. It is not only difficult to accept the modification of this treaty by means of communication or the convening of private meetings, but also contrary to democratic principles.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Rome, 14th] The Soviet Union's rejection of the proposal to return Trieste to Italy has caused panic in political circles here. The Italian government does not conceal its significant dissatisfaction, especially with the rumors that the Soviet Union will take action during the Italian general election to "assist the Italian People's Front."</p>
<p>[Associated Press London, 13th] It is generally observed that the Soviet Union's rejection of the US, British, and French proposal of March 20 is a response to the serious blow to the Communist Party in the Italian general election on April 18.</p>
<p>[United Press Trieste, 14th] Pro-Italian factions here are very frustrated to learn that the Soviet Union has refused to discuss the return of Trieste to Italy. 50,000 people were originally scheduled to meet in United Square tomorrow night, and the tone of the declaration issued at that time may be changed as a result. Some people believe that it may develop into an anti-Soviet demonstration. Others said that the Soviet Union's move is tantamount to admitting that the Italian Communist Party will fail in the general election on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Italian Election Campaign Heats Up; US Planes Will Fly in Formation as a Show of Force; Italian Prime Minister Reveals Communist Conspiracy to Obstruct European Recovery</h3>
<p>[Reuters New York, 13th] Denver Post reporter Carysen from "B-29 Aircraft in the Atlantic" telegraphed the newspaper that several US Superfortress aircraft will fly in the Italian sky before the Italian general election on Sunday "to show the strength of Western powers," and then the aircraft will fly to Saudi Arabia.

<p>[Reuters Rome, 14th] With only four days left before Italy's first general election in 25 years, the election campaigns of various political parties are becoming increasingly heated. All kinds of slogans and magical marks convenient for illiterate people to identify appear on roads, sidewalks, walls, and eaves.</p>
<p>The symbol of the Christian Democratic Party is a Crusader shield with the word "Freedom" written on it. The People's Front led by the Communist Party uses a pattern with a red star as the background and the portrait of the Italian sage Garibaldi printed on it as a symbol. Voters only need to draw a cross on the symbol to vote for which party. The election campaign is scheduled to stop 48 hours before voting begins on April 16. Prime Minister Gasperi and Communist leader Togliatti are touring the country to give speeches. Most of them speak in the same city, sometimes only an hour apart. After Gasperi gave a speech in Milan yesterday, he went to Palermo in southern Sicily today. His last election speech will be delivered in Naples. Togliatti also decided to deliver his last election speech at the same venue an hour after Gasperi's speech in Naples.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 13th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi addressed a large crowd in the square in front of the Milan Cathedral on the 13th, revealing that he had obtained secret documents proving that the Communist Party has a secret plan to oppose the Marshall Plan, intending to create widespread unrest in various beneficiary countries. The document details the meeting between Italian Communist leader Longo and Soviet Communist Party leader Stanov in Bialystok, Poland. Detailed instructions were given at the meeting regarding the plan to oppose the Marshall Plan, including creating widespread unrest in countries such as France and Italy, so that US aid would have to be withdrawn. The document also stated that the Italian Communist Party would not lack the means to implement this plan in order to carry out this plan. Gasperi reiterated his request in previous election speeches in Milan, which is known as the base of the Italian Communist Party, urging the Communist leader to order the Communist Party to lay down their weapons. This remark won applause from the entire venue. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti also broadcast to the country on the night of the 13th, emphatically stating that the People's Front resolutely refuses to participate in any group or alliance that could lead Italy into a new war in order to save the interests of the Italian people.</p>

<h3>Berlin Plane Crash Investigation Encounters Obstacles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] The Anglo-Soviet joint committee investigating the mid-air collision of British and Soviet aircraft met on the 14th, but the Soviet representative did not attend, and the investigation was conducted solely by the British representative. The Soviet side had previously stated that this was a joint Anglo-Soviet investigation and could only hear testimony from British and Soviet witnesses, not from American or German witnesses. The British side believes that although the investigation is a joint Anglo-Soviet effort, the hearing of testimony cannot be limited to witnesses from the two countries. The British side also stated that regardless of whether the Soviet Union continues to participate in or withdraws from the investigation, the British side will continue with the investigation.</p>
<h3>Control of Japan Conference Adjourns as Usual Without Discussion</h3>

<h3>Soviets Tighten Control Over Berlin, Attempting to Abolish Four-Power Joint Police System, Mongolian Troops Arrive in Northern Suburbs of Berlin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 13th] The "Post Courier", registered here with the French authorities, reported that new Soviet troops, mainly composed of Mongolian soldiers, have arrived in the northern suburbs of Berlin, stationed near the village of Schwanebeck, 15 miles north of Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Before the meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command last night, the Soviet Union attempted to end the four-power joint control of the Berlin police system and deny the authority of the Berlin transport director, Rühe.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union accused the United States of effectively removing the police in the American sector of Berlin from the control of the central police station and of using the police to suppress democratic elements among the residents of the sector. As a result, theft is rampant in the American sector. If the four-power joint police system is terminated, it will provide the Soviet Union with an excuse to implement border checks at the junctions of various districts in Berlin. Denying the authority of the Berlin transport director, Rühe, is also likely a prelude to tightening control over the supply sources to the Berlin area.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 13th] According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union will demand that the Allies stop air passenger flights between the western zones of Germany and Berlin in the coming days.</p>

The proceeds from barter should be entirely consumed in Japan or the United States. The meeting also agreed that the United States could continue its current textile export volume, and the United Kingdom could increase its exports.</p>

<h3>Order Gradually Restored in Colombia, Pan-American Conference Reopened Yesterday, Aiming to Complete the Pan-American Convention Quickly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The State Department received a report from the Foreign Correspondents Association in Bogota stating that the Pan-American Conference, which was interrupted by the outbreak of the Colombian revolution, will resume on the 14th. The United States has agreed to airlift military food supplies from Panama to Bogota to support the participating delegates. To ensure that the conference can be concluded quickly, the delegates have agreed to temporarily shelve the economic issues on the agenda, including the issue of US aid to Latin America, and leave them for discussion at a special Pan-American economic conference to be held in Buenos Aires in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bogota, 13th] The first major attempt made by the international communists in the Western Hemisphere after the war has failed, according to Secretary of State Marshall's assessment of the current revolutionary movement in Colombia. Only one or two gunshots were occasionally heard in Bogota on the 12th night. After a storm, Bogota has become quiet, and although the city has not yet recovered, the situation is under the control of the authorities. Delegates from the Pan-American Conference are protected by armed teams dispatched by the Colombian authorities. The Colombian government has assured the delegations of all countries of safety and order, and it is determined that it can be fully restored by next Sunday. Sources revealed that the meetings of the Pan-American Conference will be held in the residences of the delegates in the suburbs, and most of the issues will be directly handled by a comprehensive committee composed of the chief delegates, without intending to submit them to the working committee for review and research. Therefore, it is necessary to complete the Pan-American Organization Convention within a few days and pass a stern anti-communist resolution. It was also revealed that Marshall's personal safety was once threatened last Friday when a rebel radio station accused Marshall of being involved in the murder of Colombian Liberal leader Gaitán, intending to incite the masses to attack Marshall. Fortunately, the Colombian government dispatched a price team to protect Marshall's residence within an hour of the outbreak of the riots, and no major disaster occurred. Marshall has frankly expressed his belief that the unrest in Colombia is closely related to the world crisis and the general election in Italy.</p>

<h3>Curbing Public Utility Price Hikes, Unreasonable Price Calculation Formula, Requesting the Executive Yuan to Restore Subsidy Policy, Resolution of the Public Utility Investigation Committee of the Senate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Public Utility Investigation Committee of the Municipal Senate held its first meeting at the Committee's office on Tanggu Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attending senators included Tang Shichang, Zhu Yakui, Xi Xia, Zhu Fuju, Li Kaidi, Gao Shu'an, and 30 others. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, was present. The items discussed were: (1) How to request the central government to change the central government's approved price adjustment formula for public utilities. Resolution: Since the central government promulgated the price calculation formula for public utilities in January of this year, the prices of various public utilities in the city have been adjusted four times, with each increase being significant. However, the treatment of public teachers, staff of industrial and commercial circles has not been able to be reasonably adjusted in comparison with the increase in prices. The central government first set the method for the prices of public utilities, acknowledging that they can be adjusted monthly according to the increase in the cost of living index and the price index, which is even more than the increase in the cost of living index, exceeding the affordability of the general public, which is obviously unfair. For this reason, it is resolved that the Executive Yuan should be telegraphed to consider stopping the continued application of the price calculation formula for public utilities and restoring the subsidy policy to curb the price increases of public utilities, so as to avoid leading the general price increases, and to request that before the central government decides on appropriate measures, this formula should be suspended from application from May onwards, so as to avoid causing serious consequences of social unrest. (2) How should the investigation work be carried out. Resolution: There are many improprieties in the calculation formula. Please ask the Public Utility Bureau to study and revise it. As for the actual situation of the company's profits and losses, personnel allocation, and other uses of fuel and raw materials, the committee will conduct investigations in three groups, and please first collect and supply sufficient materials. The personnel of each group will be designated by the speaker. The grouping methods are as follows: A. Group 1 - Tap water, electricity, gas. B. Group 2 - Telephone. C.

<p>At yesterday's meeting, various committee members spoke out one after another criticizing the continuous and drastic increase in public utility prices in April. Telephone, electricity, and tap water were the targets of criticism from all parties. Yan Esheng especially raised the public utility price payment strike movement recently launched by the Beijing Municipal Senate, hoping that the responsible authorities would face the seriousness of high-priced public utilities and seek emergency and reasonable measures. Li Wenjie continued with an even more intense speech, constantly criticizing the public utility price calculation formula decided by the Economic and Financial Council. He pointed out that the calculation formula contains the most drastically rising metal index, cost of living index, and foreign exchange. Even if the calculation formula is reasonable in principle, it becomes unreasonable alone today when the work treatment of the vast majority of citizens is unreasonable. He also stated that the municipal utilities are all private enterprises, and the local council has the power to restrict them according to law. If necessary, the Senate may convene a temporary general meeting to request the central government to reconsider, without having to stick to the formula formulated by a few experts who do not understand the actual situation, making it impossible for citizens to bear the burden. This opinion was warmly responded to in the meeting, and after detailed discussion, the above two resolutions were made.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Indicated That Restoring Subsidies is Not Easy</p>
<p>After the meeting, the reporter further inquired about Director Zhao's opinion on the above two resolutions. According to Director Zhao, the Senate's opinion represents public opinion, and the government should respect it. However, regarding the first point, requesting the central government to stop the continued application of the price calculation formula for public utilities from May onwards and restoring the subsidy policy is difficult in fact and not easy to do in a short period of time. Whether the central government can approve it is quite questionable. According to Director Zhao, he is actively discussing the raw material prices of public utilities with President Zhang of the Central Bank, trying to find ways to avoid high prices as much as possible. Recently, he discussed with President Zhang to request approval for the foreign exchange for oil used by public utilities to be settled one and a half or two months in advance. If permitted by the central government, this can indirectly stabilize the prices of public utilities slightly.</p>
<p>As for the second item regarding the Senate's investigation work, the Public Utility Bureau is determined to collect sufficient materials and supply them to the Senate for reference and review. If there are any questions after the review, they can directly inquire or investigate the relevant companies.</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster in Pixian, Northern Jiangsu, Various Groups Organize Emergency Relief</h3>

<h3>The Mystery of the World's Highest Peak: Decisive Outcome Expected Within Three Days - China National Aviation Corporation Special Plane Flies to Jishi Mountain, Employing Radar to Measure Altitude</h3>
<p>Chen Wen-kuan Believes It Unlikely to Exceed Mount Everest</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jishi Mountain exploration project has been officially declared terminated since the failure of the Dianuo expedition, which started strong but ended disappointingly. The mystery of Jishi Mountain's height has become the focus of widespread attention. The "Self-Reliance Exploration" plan is being actively promoted by the National Central Research Institute. However, due to the temporary lack of scientific equipment, it will not be possible to implement it until the Mid-Autumn Festival at the earliest. In order to reveal the "mystery" as soon as possible, the China National Aviation Corporation has specially dispatched a C47 type XTT62 special plane, inviting Chinese and foreign journalists from the city to fly to Jishi Mountain for a preliminary measurement.</p>
<p>The special plane is scheduled to take off from Longhua Airport at 7:00 AM this morning, arriving in Lanzhou on the same day. After staying overnight in Lanzhou, it will fly to Jishi Mountain for exploration the next morning. If the weather is good and the flight goes smoothly, results will be obtained on the same day, and the return to Shanghai can be expected the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>The special plane will be piloted by Chen Wen-kuan, Deputy General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Chen flew over the "Hump" of the Himalayas more than a hundred times. It is reported that Mr. Chen has also flown over Jishi Mountain several times. Based on his experience, he believes that the claim that Jishi Mountain's height exceeds the world's highest Mount Everest is impossible. Now, Mr. Chen has decided to use the "radar" equipment on the special plane to measure the distance between the plane and the summit of Jishi Mountain, and then calculate the accurate height of Jishi Mountain based on the aircraft's altimeter. It is reported that using "radar" to measure mountain height is accurate but not precise. However, according to Mr. Chen, he seems quite confident in proving that Jishi Mountain does not exceed the height of Mount Everest. Therefore, whether Jishi Mountain can ascend to the throne of the world's highest peak is expected to be revealed in two or three days.</p>
<p>A total of twelve journalists are accompanying the plane, and the list is as follows: Lu Naigang and Xuan Wenjie from the Central News Agency; Yuan Lunren from the Associated Press; John Lauterbach from the United Press; Casick Hubbell from the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury; Jack Burns from Life Magazine; George Alexander from the New York Times; Zhu Renjun and Dai Shengchao from the Central Photography Studio; Wei Zhigang from the Xinwen Bao; and Hong Xucai from this newspaper.</p>

<p>A confidential report was recently received by the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, stating that the Shanghai Mortgage Credit Cooperative at No. 260 Tianjin Road was suspected of illegally dealing in gold and foreign currency on the black market.

<h3>The General Labor Union Urges Industry Unions to Persuade Communist Party Members to Surrender, Promising to Guarantee Safety and Freedom</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union issued a notice to all industry unions yesterday in order to urge workers who have participated in the Communist Party organization to quickly reflect and surrender. It urged them to earnestly persuade them and to carefully report any lurking Communist Party members. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that in March, the military and police authorities in this city cracked down on important secret organs of the Communist bandits in Shanghai. Based on the documents obtained, a large number of traitorous Communist Party members were arrested. After understanding the inside story, this union made a solemn statement, absolutely supporting the government's elimination of the Communist bandits. As for good workers, we should be responsible for their protection. On April 5, we published a letter to the military and political authorities and labor and management parties in this city, requesting the government to try the arrested workers as soon as possible according to law, to protect good workers, to allow those who blindly followed to have a way to reform, and to request the factory owners to uphold the spirit of labor-management cooperation, avoid taking this opportunity to oppress workers, or make things difficult for the union. We also advise all workers to work hard to maintain self-discipline and peace of mind. Now the government has made it clear that those who have been induced to participate in the work of the Communist bandits, if they quickly surrender to the government, will definitely be given the opportunity to reform, and their jobs and physical safety can be guaranteed. In recent times, many people have surrendered to the government, and they have all received practical protection and freedom. These are all facts. However, the number of workers in this city is quite large. This union is deeply afraid that there may still be people who have gone astray or who have previously participated in the work of the Communist bandits and now regret it but are afraid to surrender. We hope that your union will earnestly persuade them to quickly surrender to the government. This union will guarantee that they will be protected by the government, and we hope that you will carefully report any lurking Communist Party members in order to eliminate the source of the chaos. This will be in line with the great plan of the country to suppress chaos and build the nation, and it will be able to stabilize social order."</p>
<h3>Tao Yunshan Talks About His Experience of Participating in the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tao Yunshan, chairman of the Silk Weaving Industry Union in the former Third District, who had participated in the Communist Party and surrendered to the police station last month, and was recently released on bail the day before yesterday, talked about his experience of participating in the Communist Party at the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon at the request of reporters. He detailed his experience of going to the bandit area for training, being assigned to Shanghai to carry out activities, and his recent surrender. Tao is from Shaoxing and studied at Shaoxing Junior High School. He once worked as a primary school teacher. He came to Shanghai in 1938 and entered the Maya Silk Factory to learn the craft. Under the bayonets of the enemy, he launched patriotic movements everywhere. The Maya workers, led by a certain Chen, organized the "Thrift and Save the Nation Association," raising funds to remit to the Chongqing Central Bank, and organizing anti-puppet unions. Tao also participated in the activities and was elected as a worker representative. He was greatly influenced by Chen's thoughts, and Chen was actually a Communist Party cadre. In 1941, Chen left Shanghai for the mainland, handing over all the work to Tao before leaving, and introducing Tao to join the Communist Party. By December 8 of the same year, when the United States and Japan went to war, the Japanese army occupied the concession, and the "Thrift and Save the Nation Association" was dissolved. In February 1943, Maya planned to establish a new factory in Tianjin, and Tao was sent to work in Tianjin. Because he had not obtained the consent of the Communist Party in advance, he broke off relations with the Communist Party during this period. At the beginning of 1945, he returned to Shanghai, left Maya, and invested with friends to set up a silk factory in Suzhou. However, due to problems with power, the factory was closed without production, causing a lot of losses, and Tao also lost his job as a result. In the spring of 1945, he met personnel from the Communist Party's "Transportation Company" (an organization that escorted party members from the occupied areas to the "Liberated Areas") in Suzhou, who invited him to go to the "Liberated Areas" for training. Tao happily agreed and was sent to Xinpu Town near Liuhe, Anhui, to receive training at the "Construction University." On August 11 of the same year, Japan surrendered, and he was sent to sneak into Shanghai to work, leading the Third District Silk Weaving Union to launch labor strikes. After the grand parade to send Ma Xulun to Beijing to petition in the summer of the year before last, the senior Communist Party leaders believed that Tao's performance was too blatant and dangerous, and ordered him to temporarily hide and wait for the opportunity to sneak back to the "Liberated Area" for further training. However, Tao believed that there was no need for this and refused to obey. Therefore, the Communist Party was very dissatisfied with him. Tao's thinking also gradually developed a good impression of the Kuomintang because he was in contact with government agencies every day. He officially joined the Kuomintang last year. When the security authorities cracked down on the secret organs of the Communist Party this time, they planned to arrest him based on the roster. After receiving the news, Tao hid in the home of a friend at Lequn Middle School, Xinzha Road, for four days. After repeated consideration, he decided to surrender. Finally, Tao expressed his gratitude to the government for its leniency and said that he would be loyal to the Kuomintang in the future.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Silversmiths Gathered to Cause Trouble: Factory Owner of Utensils Seriously Injured</h3>

<h3>Adulterer Coerces Loan: Husband Commits Assault Out of Jealousy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiang Zhaoshun, a rickshaw puller, 28 years old, from Jiangbei, lives at No. 106, Mei Jiaqiao, Dong Zhuanbang, Jiangsu Road. Seven years ago, he married Liu Ying (24 years old), a woman from his hometown, and came to Shanghai together, raising two sons. Four or five years ago, due to the war, Jiang worked as a casual laborer and often left home to work. Wang Yian, a 32-year-old barber from Funing, who worked at No. 50 nearby, seduced Liu Ying when he came to her house, and they had an affair. Jiang soon found out about it and advised Liu to break up with Wang, but Wang kept harassing her and asked Jiang's wife for a loan, threatening to announce the affair. At about 4:00 PM on the 12th, Wang went to Jiang's wife again to force her to borrow 2 million yuan, but was refused. Soon after, he came again and was caught by Jiang, who became jealous and drove him away, and scolded his wife for being shameless. Liu was furious and went to her lover to question him. Jiang chased after her with a kitchen knife, intending to intimidate Liu into returning home. When Jiang also arrived at Wang's place, he saw Liu grabbing Wang's collar. Jiang was furious and slashed Wang's head four times with the knife, causing heavy bleeding. He was detained by his neighbor Wang Xiaodi and others who came by, and the police were called to take him and the murder weapon to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau. The sub-bureau charged Jiang with attempted murder and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The injured person was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Allocation of Working Capital Loans to Cotton Merchants for Cotton Purchasing, Simplified Procedures by the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee</h3>
<p>Optimistic Outlook on Cotton Purchases</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the progress of the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee's entrusted cotton purchasing work by cotton merchants, our reporter paid another visit to Liu Pingsun, Chairman of the Cotton Merchants Association, yesterday. According to him, following previous suggestions to the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, the committee has been discussing simplifying procedures for days, and satisfactory results have been achieved. The difficulty previously felt by cotton merchants lay in the time spent on receiving working capital loans. This was due to the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee's vast operations and numerous internal departments. Loan allocation matters required careful consideration and had to go through various relevant departments for layer-by-layer verification, which inevitably took time. Now, after consultation among the relevant departments, to encourage cotton merchants to actively purchase cotton, it has been decided that each of the three offices responsible for allocating working capital loans—Finance, Accounting, and Auditing—will send one staff member to work permanently in the Procurement and Transportation Department. This aims to expedite the review and approval procedures in the same location and at the same time. However, cotton merchants handling these matters must arrive at the committee no later than 2:00 PM each day to avoid delays. Those arriving after 2:00 PM will have to wait until the next day. With this reform, the difficulties faced by cotton merchants should be resolved smoothly, which will greatly benefit future purchasing efforts. Furthermore, the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee's cotton purchases have been quite robust in recent days, and the committee is optimistic about the future of cotton purchasing.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions Still Precarious in Other Areas, Cotton Yarn Market Listless, Outside Merchants Reduce Inventory, Narrow Fluctuations in Grey Cloth</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market remained sluggish. Due to precarious yarn prices in other areas, outside merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and all stalls opened at lower prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 228 million, briefly falling to 227 million during the session. As closing approached, weaving mills slightly increased demand, gradually strengthening, and ultimately closing at 230 million, a decline of 3 million. Bao Guang and Yue Shui also dropped by around 2 million. 40-count Blue Phoenix and 32-count Silver Moon, which were selling well locally, generally rose by 1 million to 2 million. 12-count Double Horse only saw slight interest from front-row merchants, with a very stable trend and narrow fluctuations, opening at 141 million and closing at 143 million, a further decrease of 2 million. 20-count, except for Duo Bao, Da Fa, and Cai Wu Zi, which marginally increased, all others fell by 1 million to 3 million.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth saw narrow fluctuations yesterday. Shirting and colored twill fabrics were being supplied and sold smoothly by dyeing factories, but sales to outside merchants on this street remained stagnant, and prices were weak. Northern and Guangdong merchants were trading with each other. Hankou merchants stationed in Shanghai were buying bleached cloth, and prices remained firm. Gray broadcloth from umbrella factories saw brisk business. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company's purchase permits for small printed cotton cloth were selling at a loss of 20,000, with few buyers.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Yarn Sales</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Construction Company sold 13 types of cotton yarn as usual yesterday (the 14th). There were a total of 400 purchase applications, and 1,103 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 1,780 pieces of 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>The opening prices for each yarn were as follows: 20-count Golden Rooster, 125 million; 6-count Deputy Sunlight, 66 million; 8-count Sunlight, 69 million; 10-count Li Ma, 71 million; 16-count Red Moon, 95 million; 32-count Yang He, 154 million; 32-count Double-Strand Immortal Peach, 178 million.</p>
<p>40-count Blue Phoenix, 180 million; 40-count TK Color Ball, 233 million; 42-count Double-Strand Blue Phoenix, 225 million; 60-count Sunlight, 235 million; 60-count Double-Strand Sunlight Singed, 310 million; 100-count Double-Strand Sunlight Singed, 400 million.</p>
<h3>Rayon Silk Market Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon silk market continued to weaken. Besides weaving, all other goods were weak. Furthermore, with the silk market shrinking again, sentiment became even more fragile. 120-count Tian Qiao New Loan initially stood at 230 million, but outside merchants sold at high prices, falling as low as 227 million. As the midday session approached, there was a slight rebound, ultimately closing at 229 million, a further decrease of 4 million. Dong Yang and Jin San Ma also dropped by around 4 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the silk market continued to show weakness. Da Cheng bedspreads opened at 140.2 million, then gradually declined to 138.4 million, ultimately closing at 239.2 million, another decrease of 1.8 million. Bi Crepe saw few offers, with limited transactions. Rumors of silk allocation in the market led to a downturn in sentiment and a price decline. The morning opening price for CD level was 345 million, with five bundles traded at the midday close, with the initial offer price at seven bundles, priced at 340 million. Hand-spun silk also softened by 5 million. Regarding exports, it is rumored that the China Silk Company will have a batch of transactions with Myanmar, which is currently under negotiation.</p>
<h3>Implementing Barter Trade with Japan, Executive Yuan to Establish a Task Force</h3>

<h3>Rice Prices Initially Firm, Then Flat, Flour Prices Stop Falling and Rebound, Edible Oil Prices Decline</h3>

<h3>Bears Take Advantage of the Opportunity, Chinese Stocks Fall into a Slump</h3>

<p>The morning opening was flat and sluggish. The expected foreign exchange adjustment failed to materialize. Yong Yarn opened low at 1,820 yuan, rose to a high price of 1,885 yuan, and gradually declined. There were very few transactions in the middle of the session, and outside stimulation greatly reduced. Near noon, it retreated to a low price of 1,790 yuan, and the closing price was 1,795 yuan. As a result, Huaxin fell by 10% compared to the previous close, Qinxing Xinhua Business fell by 5%, Zhabei was still flat, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>There was no special progress in the afternoon market. Except for the commission fee being leveled off and opening slightly higher, there was no achievement. Yong Yarn started from 1,800 yuan, was driven up to 1,820 yuan, but there were many settlements, and transactions did not improve. The market was boring. Although the National Bank's difference was small, it still retreated to 1,790 yuan. The closing was maintained by Nos. 104 and 160, rising to 1,800 yuan. As a result, Guohuo Lilian was still flat compared to the morning close, Hengfeng fell by 5%, Zhongsij Zhabei fell slightly, Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Qinxing, Xinhua, Yonggong, Tongyi, Datong, Rongfeng, Jinglun, Business, and Matches all rose slightly.

Only British United had the favorable news of issuing a dividend of HK$0.7, which was particularly strong, with buying bids seen at a high of 3.03 million after the opening. Yi Yarn opened in the morning at 2.45 million, with a high price of 2.47 million, and closed at 2.41 million.

<h3>Hangzhou New Longjing Weakens, Pingshui Pearl Tea Prices Firm and Brisk</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou New Longjing, which had just opened recently, saw its prices soften yesterday due to continuous arrivals and the quality not being as fresh as the first batch. The market atmosphere was difficult to support, and the foundation was somewhat shaky. As for the various old teas, they continued to be sold as inventories dwindled. Domestic sales to local and outside merchants remained sluggish. Export grades were more active due to some exporters replenishing stocks, and prices continued to firm up. Among them, the 1947 Pingshui Pearl Tea was particularly outstanding, rising by 13 million per dan, an increase of 1 million.</p>

<h3>Wang Lingji Hosts Reporters to Discuss Handling of the Chengdu Student Protests, Determined to Rectify Academic Morale</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 13th] Sichuan Chairman Wang Lingji hosted reporters for the first time this afternoon at 3 PM, detailing the provincial government's handling of the recent student protests. Acting Secretary-General Ren Wangnan, Director of Construction He Beiheng, President of Huada University Fang Shuxuan, and Chief Secretary of the Education Department Qiao Cheng all attended. More than fifty members of the press were present. Wang stated in his address that the student petition incident was not purely a matter of affordable rice prices but was in fact a response to student protests elsewhere, serving as a prelude to what the communists call the "May Uprising." This is evident from the slogans of the student marches, such as "Oppose Hunger, Oppose Civil War, Oppose Conscription and Grain Levy." Such undesirable elements must be eliminated. He also expressed his determination to rectify academic morale. He Beiheng refuted the rumors vigorously spread by bad elements that a female student at Sichuan University had died from injuries sustained while swimming, clarifying that the student was injured when she was pushed to the ground by the crowd while attempting to enter the provincial government, and is currently receiving medical treatment at the New Sports Institute.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of Parliament</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>(The Purpose of Parliament, by Quintin Hogg, Blandford Press. 198 pages, ten shillings and sixpence.)</p>
<p>Britain is the birthplace of modern democracy. Although it still maintains a constitutional monarchy, all political systems, whether central or local, and all domestic and foreign policy decisions must be decided by Parliament. Parliament is the highest organ of the state. On the positive side, it determines major national policies and submits them to the government for execution. On the negative side, it supervises the government to ensure that it does not infringe on the basic rights of the people and does not increase their suffering. Therefore, the power of the British Parliament surpasses everything, even more so than that of the United States Congress.</p>
<p>Today, the National Assembly of our country is meeting in the capital, and the Legislative Yuan will also hold its first meeting. Mr. Hertley of the Sino-British Cultural Association sent me three books, "The Purpose of Parliament," "The House of Commons," and "The People and the Government," asking me to recommend them to readers. I feel that China's politics has just taken the first step towards democratic governance and is still in the kindergarten stage of learning democracy. Apart from working hard to learn, everything else is nonsense. Last year, I believed that the most important task for China's constitutionalism was to make the people understand the content and spirit of the Constitution. I specially wrote a "Outline of the Chinese Constitution" and published it by the Zhonghua Book Company as a university textbook, but it is not suitable for the general public to read. After reading "The Purpose of Parliament" and "The House of Commons," I deeply feel that our publishing industry should also publish some popular booklets on the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, so that the general public can understand how our national public opinion organs operate. If someone adopts my suggestion, then these three booklets are worth introducing.</p>
<p>"The Purpose of Parliament" is less than two hundred pages long, but its content is divided into twenty-four chapters. The first chapter, "The Origin of Parliament," divides the development of the British Parliament into five stages, evolving into today's Parliament. From this, it can be seen that today's British Parliament is the result of natural development and also the price paid by the people for fighting for democracy. The second chapter, "The Seat of Parliament," states that the British Parliament building has been destroyed by fire four times since the 13th century. The last time was in May 1941, when it was bombed by German planes, causing a major fire. The House of Commons chamber was completely destroyed and needs to be rebuilt. The House of Lords chamber was unharmed, and the House of Commons always holds meetings in the House of Lords chamber. The third chapter, "The King," the fourth chapter, "The House of Lords," and the fifth chapter, "The House of Commons," clearly explain the relationship between the head of state and the Parliament.</p>
<p>The seventh chapter, "The Privileges of Parliament," the eighth chapter, "The Powers of Parliament," and the ninth chapter, "The Cabinet," analyze the actual operation of British politics in detail. From this, we can see that Britain adopts a responsible cabinet system, in which the cabinet has joint responsibility to the Parliament. The cabinet must obtain the trust of the Parliament; otherwise, the cabinet has only two options: either dissolve the Parliament or resign voluntarily. This is completely different from the presidential system in the United States.</p>
<p>The tenth chapter, "Political Parties," and the eleventh chapter, "The Opposition Party," explain the origin of political parties, the rise of the Labour Party, party discipline and policies, and the relationship between the ruling party and the opposition party, pointing out that allowing criticism from the opposition party is a driving force for promoting political progress, which deserves our attention the most.</p>
<p>Chapter 12, "The Civil Service," Chapter 13, "The Publication of Parliamentary News," Chapter 14, "Elections of Members of Parliament," Chapter 15, "Basic Procedures," Chapter 17, "The Passage of Bills," Chapter 18, "The Opening and Recess of Parliament," and Chapter 20, "Past and Present Views of Parliament," are all limited by space and cannot be introduced in detail.</p>
<p>The last chapter, "A World Parliament?" raises a question that deserves our attention. The author believes that the United Nations Charter is not enough to constitute a free world government. He says, "A government must have a legislative body to make laws, an executive body to enforce laws, and a judicial body to implement laws. And the United Nations is just a permanent peace conference, and every strong country has the power to exercise veto power." (See page 188) The author's opinion is worthy of our study.</p>
<h3>Eternal Remembrance</h3>
<p>— Sun Panshou</p>
<p>(Written by Feng Zikai, et al. Dahong Bookstore, first edition, February 1937)</p>
<p>The recently published "Eternal Remembrance" by Dawie Books is a collection of essays, included in the "Dahong Literature Series," collecting several articles written by Feng Zikai, Ye Shengtao, Shi Zhicun, Yang Tongfang, Fu Binran, Ren Lun, Zhong Jiyu, Qin Sheng, and others to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the death of Master Hongyi (the artist Li Shutong).</p>
<p>Before becoming a monk, Master Hongyi was highly regarded for his calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose. He studied in Japan in his early years, participated in the revolution, and devoted himself to art and teaching after returning to China. He was a scholar with lofty ideals and did not follow the crowd. After becoming a monk, he devoted himself to practicing the Brahma way, and was even more respected as a great monk of his generation.</p>
<p>Reading this book makes us have an irresistible longing for Master Hongyi. It is not due to the power of religion, because none of the authors purely regarded Master Hongyi as a great monk, nor did they regard him as a superhuman. As the preface says, he was very ordinary, "commemorating his ordinariness, not commemorating his brilliance." I think his ordinary life, which was full of humanity, showed his greatness.</p>
<p>Feng Zikai's "Speaking of Master Hongyi for Young People" is both sentimental and well-written. It looks simple and unadorned, but it is very thought-provoking when studied carefully. The author was a senior student of Master Hongyi before he became a monk, so he knew a lot about Master Hongyi's life, so he spoke very sincerely. The article describes the teaching situation of Master Hongyi in detail, and his sincere and serious attitude is really admirable. In the end, he praised his immortal personality and moral achievements.</p>
<p>Ye Shengtao's "Talking about Master Hongyi's Death Verses" has a profound intention. He said, "Master Hongyi wrote two verses before his death. The last two sentences of the second verse are 'The branches are full of spring and the sky is full of moon'. In my opinion, this is a description of his life and an explanation of his life experience; he entered the world once, experienced all kinds of things, and studied all kinds of things. When he was about to die, it was when the spring was full and the moon was round. This is naturally a good death, but a good death comes from a good life." These words are nothing more than stating that the most important thing for a person is his own attitude towards life.</p>
<p>Yang Tongfang's "Learning the Educational Spirit of Master Hongyi" and Fu Binran's "Returning from the Fifth Anniversary Memorial Meeting of Master Hongyi's Passing" both praise Master Hongyi's educational spirit when he was a layman. His teaching attitude was so sincere and kind, easy-going and meticulous. Indeed, Master Hongyi is truly worthy of being a great "teacher"!</p>
<p>Shi Yicun's "Praise of Master Hongyi" is elegant in diction, praising Master Hongyi's courage and wisdom, which is expressed from truly understanding his mood and ambition.</p>
<p>Other articles such as Zhong Jiyu's "Reminiscence" and Qin Sheng's "Inspiration of Spirit and Practice" will make us further understand Master Hongyi's enthusiasm for saving the world and his spirit of practicing what he preached. Ren Lun's "If Master Hongyi Were Still Alive" is full of infinite emotion and indignation. Yes, the current social atmosphere and this land, the national fortune is so declining, if the compassionate Master Hongyi is still alive, can he not cry bitterly?</p>
<p>In a society full of tricks, fraud, harm, hatred, indifference, and insidiousness, we need to see a little light, heat, love, justice, and sympathy. From the life of this rare philosopher, we should get a great feeling!</p>
<h3>The Complete Book of Music</h3>
<p>— Rong Juzhen</p>
<p>(B. Cyclopedia of Music &amp; Musicians, Fourth Edition, 1946)</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the popularity of radio receivers, the opportunities for Chinese people to appreciate Western music have increased a lot. Modern young people not only know famous dance music such as "The Blue Danube" and "Wine, Women, and Song," but even more classical works such as "Unfinished Symphony" and "Hungarian Rhapsody" are also warmly welcomed. This is really a good phenomenon in the music world. The moon in the West is certainly not rounder than the moon in China, but the superiority of Western music is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The understanding of music, of course, mostly relies on the training of hearing, and cannot be fully inspired by the knowledge in books. But true music researchers and appreciators seem to have to rely on the help of books. If we do not acquire the knowledge of Carmen from books, do not know how Carmen falls in love with people, and do not know how Carmen is killed, and rashly go to listen to the musical drama Carmen, then our understanding of the music will be discounted at least. The above example can prove the importance of book knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on the above understanding, I am providing a rather complete music reference book here, which is also the topic of this article—"The Complete Book of Music." This book is edited by the American musician Thompson Zuren, and the contributors include not only famous musicians and scholars in the American music world, but also composers, music educators, conductors, and music critics from Germany, France, Italy, and other European countries. The editors selected the most essential and applicable manuscripts from the submissions from all parties and compiled them into this booklet. Therefore, each item is written by the most appropriate person to write the most essential manuscript, so this book has become a unique work in the music world.</p>
<p>The nature and content of the Complete Book of Music, of course, belong to the category of dictionaries. The knowledge about music can be said to be all-inclusive and very complete. Generally speaking, we can divide its content into three categories: (1) theory, (2) history, and (3) biography. The theoretical and historical aspects are relatively dull materials, and the fluency of the narrative and the correctness of the explanation are certainly worthy of praise. But my focus is not on these, but on the last item, which is the biographies of musicians. Musical works, like other arts, are the expression of the author's thoughts and feelings. He pours pure thoughts and feelings into the music, making his work a bridge between the author and the audience. Therefore, the thoughts and feelings of musicians will resonate with the audience. For people who want to truly understand musical works, the biographies of musicians cannot be ignored. Otherwise, we will have no way of knowing the musician's personal life, social environment, ideological background, etc., which are the decisive factors in completing the music. In these biographies, we can also learn about the musician's state of mind, wisdom, and methods when creating the music; whether his work has an original style or is imitated; what the status of his work was at the time, and what the impact on future generations. The above-mentioned knowledge should be of great help to the understanding and appreciation of musical works. In the dozens of biographies in this Complete Book of Music, we can see the above-mentioned points, which are explained concisely and thoroughly. Whether it is a musician, music teacher, or ordinary audience, as long as they are truly interested in music, they will definitely get spiritual satisfaction when reading these biographies. A simple chronology and catalog of works are also attached to the end of these biographies, making it extra convenient for readers to browse. One more thing worth mentioning is that the characteristics of the musician are sometimes indicated by a few words in the biography. For example, for Mozart's works, the three words Brightness, Gaity, and Serenity are used. What an appropriate judgment! We should not listen to any of Mozart's works, whether it is a symphony, concerto, or string quartet. If we have the opportunity to listen to it, we will immediately feel the bright, joyful, and solemn musical style. —The Complete Book of Music is indeed a valuable publication, and there is a reason for it.</p>
<p>If domestic music educators can take some time to collectively translate this valuable book, it will be a great contribution to readers (or listeners) who do not understand foreign languages.</p>

<h3>The Three Great Problems of Geometry</h3>
<p>— Li Musun</p>
<p>(Written by Klein, translated by Yu Jieshi, Commercial Press)</p>
<p>Some time ago, it was rumored that Mr. Yang Jiaru, an accountant at a local store, had invented a solution to one of the three great problems of geometry, the trisection of an arbitrary angle. It was really amazing, and many newspapers cited it as the light of Chinese mathematics. But in fact, higher mathematics has already told us that this is impossible, and besides, Mr. Yang's solution has many loopholes. For example, he said that the locus of the trisection point is actually an arc, but we all know that the locus of the trisection point is the trisector line, which is a straight line rather than other curves.</p>
<p>This "Three Great Problems of Geometry" discusses the three great problems of geometry in detail—namely, the duplication of the cube, also known as the Delian Problem, the trisection of an arbitrary angle, and the squaring of the circle—and at the same time clearly proves that these three problems are impossible to solve, not difficult to solve. It tells us that what can be solved by geometric methods (that is, only using a compass and a straightedge) are quadratic equations, and these three problems are cubic equations, so no matter how you start, it is impossible. Unless it is a special angle, such as a straight angle, a right angle, etc. In fact, there are more than three geometric problems, and thousands of cubic equation problems are unsolvable, and they are all difficult problems. In addition to the three major problems, this book also discusses the solutions to many other interesting problems, such as the construction of a regular heptadecagon, the approximation of π, and the transcendence of e. I dare say that as long as you read this book carefully, you will definitely have a great interest in geometry.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Professor Felix Clein, is a famous professor of mathematics in Germany. The purpose of writing this book is not only to discuss the three great problems of geometry. He tells me that learning mathematics is inseparable from algebra and geometry, because these three geometric problems could not be solved for thousands of years until modern times, thanks to the help of analytical methods, that it was possible to prove that they are impossible to solve.</p>
<p>Finally, I tell you readers that this book is quite advanced, because the knowledge of elementary mathematics alone is definitely not enough. This book has cited advanced algebra and analytical geometry and other profound mathematics, so to read this book: First, you must have a good mathematical foundation; second, you should read it carefully rather than skim it, so that you can achieve the effect of "opening a book and benefiting."</p>
<h3>A Doctor's Confession</h3>
<p>— Wei Yuan</p>
<p>Written by V. Veresaev, Translated by Zhen Jiang, Published by Kaiming</p>
<p>Someone once said that a doctor's subject is "the patient." It's "disease" and "person," not just "disease" alone. Well, I say that "A Doctor's Confession" provides a very profound, clear, and straightforward explanation of these principles.</p>
<p>The core of the book is succinctly portrayed in the translator's "Introduction to the Author's Personality and Works" at the beginning: "The content narrates his observations and experiences during his time at medical university and the years following graduation as a practicing doctor. Through his pen, one can glimpse the capabilities of modern medicine, the level of doctors, the psychology of patients towards doctors, the attitude of society towards doctors, and the attitude of doctors towards the patient and society. He observes everything with keen eyes and a sensitive heart, considering everything thoroughly. Then, with the attitude of 'speaking publicly about public matters; speaking privately about matters without personal bias,' he exposes every aspect of the dark side to the best of his ability, allowing everyone to understand the complex relationships between doctors, patients, and society."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the first part of the book describes how the author entered the door of new medicine, how he was cleansed by new medicine within its walls, how he recognized new medicine, and how he strived to understand new medicine from blood and corpses. To understand this, we only need to read chapters like "Student Life and the Society Seen by Medical Students," "The Pain of Various Illnesses," "Praise and Disappointment Regarding Medicine," and "The Imperfection of Medical Education." We can then know how the author uses a light yet incisive tone to write about everything he encountered within the doors of new medicine, as well as the extraordinary things he touched upon, saw clearly, through his in-depth observations and thoughts.</p>
<p>Throughout, the author reveals genuine emotion. Sometimes we laugh while reading, and then our emotions plunge into an atmosphere of pain; sometimes we seem lost on our journey, but immediately we find answers and a way forward.</p>
<p>The second part describes how the author, outside the school gates among the masses, used everything he learned at school to confront everything. I think this part is more worth reading than the first, and it is more likely to inspire many insights:</p>
<p>Without mentioning anything else, we can first look at the chapter "Civilization and the Human Body." In addition to citing many examples to illustrate the fact that "humanity should enjoy the benefits of civilization without destroying the harmony of nature," the author also describes his own methods of maintaining health. He said, "Until the year I graduated from university, I spent every summer living as a manual laborer, plowing, harvesting, or felling trees in the mountains. I know what happiness comes from muscle fatigue, what it is like to eat like a wolf, how sweet deep sleep is, and how little the wind and weather are to be feared. Even today, if I have the opportunity to go to the fields, I will still bring an axe. Only when my hands are calloused, my body is strong, and I deeply feel the true joy of life," The author has written out the theme that a doctor should write to those outside of his profession, or all that he should write to the society around him. Although some people may not have experienced such things, they must personally experience them. Because these should be everyone's concern — not just doctors.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the chapter "Women's Shame and Doctors" is also extremely well-written. This is a type of writing rarely seen elsewhere. Regarding "Women's Shame and Female Doctors," the author is pointing out a path to be developed for future generations, an important path.</p>
<p>Finally, the author writes several chapters on doctors and money, which I think everyone should read. In particular, I feel that the chapters "The Sound of Money Between Doctors and Patients" and "The Obligations of Stringent Doctors" accurately portray the misunderstandings of countless people and the voices of countless hearts. The author does not defend doctors; on the contrary, he defends the poor with a detached attitude, reserving his merciless condemnation only for greedy and stingy dignitaries.</p>
<p>In this book, the author indeed uniquely reveals the depths of many things that people often encounter but never think about, and his writing style is so subtle that it does not make people feel like they are reading a book with a strong scientific flavor. Reader Zhu Zhenjiang is also a giant in this field, so this translation can be so perfect. Of course, Mr. Zhu also has a great relationship.</p>
<p>I dare to recommend this book to: doctors who have not read it, future doctors preparing to practice medicine. Of course, I should recommend it even more to: anyone outside the medical circle.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Freedom of the Press</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>In the successive meetings of the International Press Conference in Geneva this time, not only the issue of freedom of the press itself was discussed, but also the freedom of thought and expression of thought and meaning were widely discussed. This is indeed an issue that interests all freedom-loving people around the world.</p>
<p>I remember that the late US President Franklin D. Roosevelt once included freedom of the press as one of the four freedoms of mankind. This is indeed the greatness of Roosevelt as a politician. Because to this day, the importance of the press to human life has been universally recognized. Its impact on human civilization can be said to be above any cultural undertaking. The so-called newspaper is the spiritual food of the masses, which is certainly no empty word.</p>
<p>However, although the press has a significant impact on human life, whether it is meritorious or criminal is still an unresolved issue. For example, at this Geneva press conference, the United States and the Soviet Union both had proposals regarding the policy of the press. The Soviet Union advocated that all news belonging to fascist ideology and encouraging war ideology should be stopped and absolutely not published, while the US proposal requested "the cessation of the continued official propagation of false or distorted reports sufficient to increase hatred or promote prejudice against countries, individuals, or groups of different races, languages, religions, or philosophical beliefs." These two proposals, which seem the same at first glance but are actually different, are known to informed people as having their own political backgrounds. But generally speaking, they all illustrate that the world's press still lacks a truly sound foundation to date.</p>
<p>So-called freedom of the press naturally includes freedom of expression of thought, because although news must be based on facts, the reporting of news must pass through the expression of thought and meaning. Regarding the expression of human thought and meaning, it is not limited to journalistic work. All poetry, literature, philosophy, and plastic arts such as painting and sculpture are tools or crystallization of human thought and meaning. However, because of the technical relationship of the press, the freedom of expression of thought related to the press is the representative issue of all freedom of expression of thought today.</p>
<p>Since news cannot be separated from the basis of certain facts, the so-called freedom of expression of thought in news also has certain limits. Freedom of thought is only a relative concept. The realm of freedom of thought can only expand with the expansion of human intellect. For example, after his theory of relativity, Einstein recently made new discoveries about the relationship between gravitation and electrons. According to the opinions of general scientists, this new knowledge will have a more important impact on the future world than atomic energy. However, to date, there are not many people who can understand this new knowledge, even among high-level scientific experts. Therefore, although Einstein's realm of thought has reached almost the level of paralleling the universe itself, most people are still lagging behind. This is an empirical evidence of the relative relationship between freedom of thought and intellect.</p>
<p>However, this cannot be used as an excuse for the issue of freedom of expression of thought in news. Because in terms of the intellect of modern people, although it cannot be said to be high to what extent, if there are no external constraints, human thought and expression of meaning can obtain free development. The problem now is how to enable the freedom of expression of thought in news to obtain a reasonable foundation. Mr. Hugh Baillie, President of United Press, said in a broadcast address in Geneva on the 3rd of this month that this international conference is striving for a Magna Carta on freedom of the press to serve as the foundation for the world's press. Although I am not a member of the press, I sincerely hope that this move will be successful.</p>
<p>Although there are various external obstacles to the freedom of news and expression of thought at present, the most important thing is that members of the press can improve their professional morality and sense of social responsibility. Because the meaning of the so-called freedom of expression of thought is relative, as already said. The word "expression" itself is not a simple technical issue but a thought issue. A person who knows how to expand their realm of thought in the cultivation of intellect will not think that external conditions may hinder the freedom of expression of their thought. Therefore, in addition to opening up external conditions, the more important thing in striving for the freedom of news and expression of thought is to expand the intellectual realm of members of the press themselves.</p>
<p>In the proposal submitted to the conference by my country's representative, Dr. Zhang Pengchun, there is a clause that requires improving the morality and social responsibility of the journalistic profession, rejecting commercialism and sensationalism, eliminating racial and religious prejudice, and engaging in accurate, objective, and clear reporting work. No one can oppose these propositions, but to achieve this, it is necessary to start by strengthening the intellectual cultivation of journalists.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou People's View of Shanghai Tourists</h3>
<p>— Yun Geng</p>
<p>In these few days, Shanghai tourists are pouring into paradise like a tide, batch after batch. According to informal statistics from the police station, at least 40,000 tourists stay in this small city center every day. The government officials, merchants, and coolies of Hangzhou are sincerely welcoming these tourists, because most Shanghai tourists are great consumers. They not only directly increase the income of merchants and coolies, but also indirectly increase government tax revenue, thereby solving financial difficulties. Therefore, some people say: Shanghai tourists are happy, because in Hangzhou, in addition to being in West Lake and enjoying the intoxication of the fragrant lake breeze, they can also win the general welcome and envy of Hangzhou people.</p>
<p>But it is not entirely like this. In Hangzhou, there are at least two types of people who deeply resent and hate Shanghai tourists; and there is a type of people who are indifferent to the arrival of Shanghai tourists, and do not know whether it is good or bad.</p>
<p>Among the two types of people who deeply resent Shanghai tourists, the first is housewives. Prices have been relatively stable in the past few days, but the feeling in the vegetable market seems to be particularly sensitive. Not only fish and shrimp need to be snatched, but also pork, which has a stable price on weekdays, has also jumped greatly. Housewives are responsible for purchasing goods in the kitchen, and the sharp rise in vegetables in the past few days has made them feel tricky when purchasing goods, so they blame this evil on this temporary consumer group — Shanghai tourists. The second is the general salaried public school staff, although they are on West Lake, but they rarely have the opportunity to visit the lake or climb the mountain on weekdays, most of which are due to economic reasons. This type of people does not dislike Shanghai tourists, but in fact jealousy makes them resentful.</p>
<p>Another type of people, probably belonging to the general small property owners class of men, are not directly affected by the rise in vegetable prices due to the large increase in consumption in life, because this is a matter for their wives; at the same time, they are not jealous of the extravagance of Shanghai tourists, but they do not necessarily welcome them. The general attitude is: it is good to come, it is good not to come.</p>
<p>However, although Hangzhou people's attitudes towards Shanghai tourists are different, there is one point of view that is completely the same, that is, they are rich and extravagant. Almost every Hangzhou person thinks that Shanghai tourists are rich, and the amount of money is so much that it is amazing! As for extravagance, it is because they have money. Those who have money are naturally extravagant, so it seems not surprising that extravagance is reflected in Shanghai tourists.</p>
<p>But there are also many people who think that the extravagance of Shanghai tourists is a bit too much. The so-called "too much" means acting like a "fool". In fact, it does not matter if the rich temporarily act like a fool, just like the boatmen said: "Sir, three winters rely on one spring, it is rare". Because it is rare, it is okay to temporarily act like a "cucumber". However, most Hangzhou people think that it is completely unnecessary to act like a cucumber sometimes. The so-called "when you enter the country, ask about customs", the hearts of the people in Hangzhou are not bad after all. If tourists can plan ahead for travel, accommodation, food, and play, we can guarantee that certain places will never act like a "cucumber".</p>
<p>Another point is that it seems unnecessary for Shanghai people to visit West Lake in the spring. Although there are various reasons to lure tourists in the spring, during this period, sightseeing must be crowded in the sea of people, and eating and accommodation may not be comfortable. At the same time, the scenery of West Lake in the autumn, such as the osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong and the sugarcane flowers in Xixi, also has a unique charm, and why can't it intoxicate the hearts of tourists? Therefore, in the view of Hangzhou people, why not divide half of the Shanghai tourists to come and play again after the autumn is cool? Wouldn't it make the various distributions more average?</p>

<h3>The Ingenious Thief</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Many missing treasures are not necessarily buried at the bottom of the sea or underground. Maybe they are placed in a box on the attic that has long been forgotten; maybe they are right in front of you, but separated by a board. Look at the experience of Franklin Schradle, known as the "Treasure Detective King of America," and you will know that "getting it without any effort" is not false.</p>
<p>A seventy-year-old woman died in an apartment in New York. Her relatives knew that she had a considerable inheritance, but unfortunately they didn't know where it was hidden. They searched through the small two-room apartment for two months, but still found nothing. Schradle was invited, and it only took him five minutes to find a secret drawer in an old trunk, which contained nearly $500,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Schradle specializes in designing, manufacturing, selling, and repairing boxes, accumulating more than 30 years of experience. He also specializes in finding hidden drawers in furniture and secret compartments in old houses. Not long ago, a man remembered that his family had a box of letters written to his ancestors by Washington, but he couldn't find where it was hidden. After Schradle entered the house and took a look, he felt that the paintings hanging on the wall were a bit strange, among which a portrait of Washington was the most suspicious. He took the painting down and found the precious letters hidden between the canvas and the frame. Collectors believe that this bundle of letters is worth 25,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>During the war, Schradle did something special. An American ambassador to a neutral country stayed at a hotel on Park Street in New York on his way to his post. A spy followed and searched not only the ambassador's room, but also pried open the locks of more than 150 pieces of luggage deposited by other travelers in the luggage room. Although he did not steal anything, the hotel authorities did not want the travelers to know about this matter. They secretly hired Schradle to be responsible for the work of fitting the locks. With his superb skills, Schradle actually made the travelers not know that their locks had been replaced, which can be regarded as an expert who "steals the sky and replaces the sun".</p>
<h3>Small Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Old people scold young people for "not listening to the words of the old", but young people say that the lessons of the old are equal to lies, because they have never frankly guided the later generations with some precious experience; — they are afraid that someone will be smarter than themselves because of this.</p>
<p>The green mountains remain unchanged because they are indifferent.</p>
<p>The green water flows for a long time because it never looks back.</p>
<h3>Spring Outing</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>On Qingming Festival, I traveled with Sanmu to Nanxiang. The smoke on the road was cold, very different from before the war. Later, I visited Guyi Garden, where the walls and houses were destroyed, and the stones were also eroded. The handwritings of Nanmu Hall and Dong Qichang's "Huayan Ink Sea" are only for future generations to remember. Although two new pavilions have been built, they still cannot hide the desolate atmosphere of the entire garden. I have an old sentence: "The trees also sigh with the wind and are full of emotions, and the crows seem to be telling the vicissitudes of life as guests." Now the spring grass is not recorded, what about the trees?</p>
<p>Lonely calf art bridge side, peach blossoms fade and willows wither, the world has forgotten, three or two mounds of paper ashes are cold, six states of complexion are rapeseed yellow. Who can melt iron into spring rain? I also have no home to rely on in the distance. The ancient affairs of recommending wine and steamed pigs, now people and ghosts are all in a state of anxiety.</p>
<p>Casually looking at the flowers and plants to avoid the common people, cloth socks are still suitable for short trips. A river is completely dry and is not a beautiful field. Although this garden is small, it is a barren city. It must be known that the stone fell with the tears of the three dynasties, and there is no sound of crows perched on ten thousand trees! I look forward to the year when the green is turned again, and the Jiangnan mourning ode passes through Lan Cheng.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Carefree on the Sea (126)</p>
<p>Qian Qi leaned on the iron railing, quietly watching for a while, suddenly heard someone whistling behind him. Looking back, there were two or three old men, holding canes in their hands, walking and opening their mouths to whistle. Zhu Zhai knew that these people were all health enthusiasts, welcoming the sunlight in the park and exercising their bodies. After they came, the quiet environment was disturbed by the constant whistling sound, so Zhu Zhai was unwilling to stay here. He passed through the ancient cypresses and walked straight to the door of the Jesuits Coffee Shop. Looking at the red wall opposite, the flowers were shining. Hundreds of peach trees along the wall were all in full bloom. His spirit could not help but be refreshed, and he hurried to the peach forest to admire it carefully. He saw the peach blossoms on the trees, with the buds just opening, delicate and beautiful. He remembered that he had met Qi Wan on that day, right here. Qi Wan's face, that pair of dimples, her charming smile, was no different from the delicate beauty of these peach blossoms. Now the flowers are still in bloom, but the beauty has gone. While thinking about it, he walked to the corner of the red wall, thinking that he had practiced his voice here that day, met Xiao Bai, and Qi Wan was introduced by Xiao Bai. In this year, they had been in love with each other, inseparable. He never thought that today they would be separated in the south and the north, each in his own place. Facing these peach blossoms and this red wall, he felt a sense of "the face is unknown where to go, the peach blossoms still smile in the east wind." He couldn't help but feel melancholy. He wandered in the peach forest for a long time, and he really wanted to leave this sad place, but to this trace, he also wanted to relive the old dream in his heart. He wandered and lingered, only walking back and forth in the peach forest, unwilling to leave. He thought of Qi Wan's little sister for a while, and then he thought of Qi Wan's little Wang's mother. These were all mediums for meeting Qi Wan that day. Finally, he thought of the fact that he had practiced his voice here that day and sang a section of "Yu Tang Chun". He hadn't practiced his voice for a long time now. He didn't know how his voice was, so why not take advantage of this morning, when there were few tourists, and try his voice? Thinking of this, he walked into the forest and still found the place where he had practiced his voice that day, facing the red wall, and sang at the top of his voice. Just after singing a section of "Wang Tang Chun", he turned around and saw someone laughing at him under the peach tree. When Zhu Zhai looked at it, it was none other than Xiao Bai's uncle. Unexpectedly, Xiao Bai smiled and waved to him. Zhu Zhai hurried over. Xiao Bai smiled and said, "It's rare that you came out to practice your voice again. I originally wanted to find your father, but now that I've met you, I can save myself a trip. I'll tell you good news. Qi Wan's performance in Shanghai is very smooth. She gave me a letter and a letter to your grandfather. I originally wanted to send the letter in person, but now I'll give it to you." Saying that, he took out two letters and handed them to Zhu Zhai. When Qian Qi heard that Qi Wan had a letter, his heart had already been pounding. He couldn't care about greeting Xiao Bai anymore. He took the letter and quickly unfolded it to read it.</p>
<h3>Talking about Lu Zhengxiang (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qingxue Academy</p>
<p>Having described the martial artist General Sa, who has the temperament of the mountains and forests, it is even more impossible to neglect Lu Zhengxiang, the extraordinary figure in the diplomatic world who is famous internationally, has shouldered many major events, and is most closely related to the fate of China.</p>
<p>He is the leader of "loyalty" and the leader of "treachery". He has served as the Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and special envoy and minister. Before the 1920s, he was a globally renowned figure. For the past 20 years, he has been silent and traceless. He has devoted himself to a Belgian monastery and become an ascetic monk, a recluse from the world. He is truly suffering and truly reclusive, compared to the other bureaucratic warlords who burned incense and recited Buddha, such as Zhu Rengeng, Wang Yitang, and Sun Chuanfang, the distinction between sincerity and hypocrisy cannot be measured by reason? The ancient saying "the divine dragon sees its head but not its tail" and "extreme brilliance returns to plainness" are not enough to describe his unique character and nature.</p>
<p>Why is he called the leader of "loyalty"? We must remember that in 1918, at the Paris Peace Conference, Japan wanted to formally include the acceptance of Shandong's rights into the treaty, bullying our country too much. Domestically, there was the historic "May Fourth Movement". At that time, many old bureaucrats in Beijing advocated accommodation out of fear of Japan; that is, the international situation, because Japan had already established agreements with European countries during the war, agreeing to her inheritance of German rights. As a result, President Wilson sighed that he could do nothing to help. But if China bowed its head and signed the treaty, it would immediately become Korea after the Russo-Japanese War in 1894 (a country handled by Japan), which was extremely dangerous. Finally, with a thunderous sound, the Chinese representatives did not sign the treaty and did not attend! Creating a new era of "revolutionary diplomacy" made the world powers look at it with new eyes. Afterwards, there was the Washington Conference, which limited Japan to return Qingdao; and the Nine-Power Treaty, which broke Japan's dream of monopolizing the East, and China's international status changed as a result. Mr. Lu is undoubtedly a historical great man. Some people say that the efforts of many parties at home and abroad cannot be attributed to one person. This is of course true, but we must think about what position Lu was in? He was the leader of the country's representatives, the first person responsible for special diplomatic events, not a puppet, let alone "making things happen because of others". Even if it was not his proposal, but he was able to observe public sentiment and follow group opinions, his knowledge and measure were deep and far-reaching, and his will was firm, he deserved his reputation. Therefore, he is called the leader of "loyalty".</p>
<p>Why is he called the leader of "treachery"? In 1915 (the fourth year of the Republic of China), Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands, which were aimed at further monopolizing all Chinese interests and handling East Asia, after occupying Qingdao and various road and mineral rights in Shandong. Lu, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, negotiated with the Japanese envoy Hioki Eki dozens of times, and finally agreed to sign the treaty because the other party put forward the ultimatum. The whole country was indignant and designated May 9 as the unprecedented "National Humiliation Day", comparing the Twenty-One Demands to a bill of sale. As evidenced by the various incidents launched by the Japanese afterwards, Dr. Gu Weijun's speech at the Paris Peace Conference that the Twenty-One Demands were Japan's intention to treat China as a second Korea was indeed the truth. Then, Lu, who personally signed this treaty, was of course undeniable in his role. Perhaps some people will say that at that time, there was Yuan Shikai at the top and Cao Ruilin and others at the bottom, hinting at what to hint, and running around. These are of course also facts, however, leading to the above sentence, the proper person in charge in diplomatic authority must not be regarded as a puppet, or a monarch without real power.</p>
<h3>Interesting Headline Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Sun Hong</p>
<p>Examining the *Shen Bao* newspapers from the Guangxu years thirty-six and thirty-seven, carefully looking at their news titles, they are quite interesting. Most news titles were fixed, with each place name compiled into a "poetic phrase" as a general title. For example, "Jin Tai Xiao Zhi" (Minor Records of the Golden Terrace) was the Beijing correspondence, "Yu Xue Tan Qi" (Exploring Wonders of Yu's Cave) was the Shaoxing correspondence, "Jiu Shui Wen Lin" (Literary Unicorn of Jiu River) was the Wuhu correspondence, "Jiang Huai Fang Quan" (Jiang Huai Delegation of Power) was Anqing, "Qin Huai Lu Chang" (Oar Songs of the Qin River) was Nanjing, "Lu Cheng Ke Shu" (Visitor's Account from Deer City) was the Wenzhou correspondence, and so on. It seems that at that time, newspaper readers and newspaper editors alike had experience with examination poetry, so the titles could be refined in this way. The most interesting one was when a Yangzhou correspondence suddenly bore a new title, "Riding a Crane for a Leisurely Tour," which was like presenting someone with a funeral banner.</p>
