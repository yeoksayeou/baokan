<h3>程李孫接納中常會公意　競選風波已告平息　王寵惠等晉謁總裁報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕蔣主席關心副總統選舉問題，廿六日晨九時在官邸召見白崇禧，除垂詢陝省戰事外，並就副總統選舉事有所指示。十二時半復召　陳在雷，張　，白崇禧，王寵惠，張厲生，等六人，詢問勸促三候選人撤銷放棄競選情形，下午五時主席曾赴湯山遊暨，九時在官邸召見候選人之一李宗仁，商談甚久。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電）中國國民黨中央常會所推派之代表王寵惠·張羣·白崇禧張知本·陳布醫·張厲生等廿六日午晋謁蔣總裁，報告與副總統競選人程潛·李宗仁·孫科三委員洽談經過，·程·李·孫三人均已接納中常會之公意，對副總統競問題，聽國民大民會決定，不再堅持放充，蔣總裁聞之，至表欣慰，認為如此則大會選舉可望順利進行，並表示甚　本黨籍之國大會代表亦一致體會本人在中常會中歸納眾所宣示，點日早日完成副總統之選舉。按蔣總裁在廿五日中常會之指示，即謂：中常會仍遵四月六日臨時全會之決議，對本屆副總統本黨不決定候選人，本黨同志，在國民大會中，得依法參加競選。（二）本黨同志選舉時，均可秉其自意志，選擇所認為最適宜之候選人。（三）本黨同志參加助選或選舉者，自可表示其言論之自由，但絕不可有相互攻訐對方之宣傳，換言之即積極的可以鼓吹選舉某一候選，而不隱消極的指摘任何候選華人，幷應相互尊重，相互信任，庶可為目屆行憲之理選舉樹立良好規範</p>
<p>孫李程三氏談話　願聴從國大決定</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕孫科廿六日晚八時在龍門酒家招待國大代表時，起立發言稱：渠此次表示放棄競選，係為顧全黨內之團結，但現為尊重中常會之決議及國大主席團胡適·于斌·陳啓天等五人之勸促，已決定聴從國民大會之決定，如大會不允許本人放棄競選，本人亦只有尊重國民大會意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日鴛〕李宗仁廿六日晚八時在安樂應招待助選國國大代表五百餘人，發表演說，說明四點：（一）此次放棄競選，係為顧全團結，乃不得已之舉。（二）現為顧全國大主席團之決議及勤促及中常會之決議，已表示願意聽從大會之決定，競選不競選，為本人之權利，代表選可人，則為代表之權利，本人此次競選，實並不希望成功，因不成功始可以超然地位向元首提出建議。（三）競選者過去均為共患難之朋友，此次因競選而致不快，本人實引以為憾。（四）過去淸黨即本人建議，現對共黨仍深惡痛絕。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕程潛二十六日晚發表書面談話稱：「本人放棄競選，乃為使大會順利完成，只要大會能順利進行，本人是否參加競選，無關重要。」程氏晨間曾吿記者稱：本人放棄競選之聲明，已送達主席團，自無撤回必要，但一切均當尊重國民大會之決定」。</p>
<h3>民社青年兩黨　發表聯合聲明　對副總統選舉昐遵守自原則</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕民社·靑年兩黨廿六日對劃總統選舉紛擾發表聯合聲明如次：</p>
<p>「關於副總統選舉，已於本月廿三廿四兩日繼續舉行兩次，選者與被選者均依法進行，情况大體良好，乃廿五日正準備進行第三次投票，而法定候選人程潛·李宗仁·孫科忽先後以放棄競選聞，三氏果無必須放秦之原因，吾人不能不認為其舉措似欠考慮，若以環境關係，勢非相率放棄不可，則吾人不能不為憲政前途抱莫大之隱憂。</p>
<p>過去關於制憲原則，曾經各黨派及社會賢達長期協商，去歲制憲國大，吾人亦曾參與致力，但本屆國大法定名額為三千零四十五名，我民·靑兩黨合計不足總額九分之一，維護憲法之尊嚴，吾人雖引為無可旁貸之天職，但會塲自由和協空氣之維持，則仍有賴於國民黨之努力，現旣釀成如此之紛擾，吾人不能不引為遺憾。</p>
<p>今大會已因此次不幸事件，不得已休會兩日，而時局嚴重，中外觀瞻均期待大會圓滿結束，副總統依法生產，事實昭然，不容發生任何枝節，顯而易見，因此，我民靑兩黨不能不本以往維護憲法之初衷，團結禦侮之宗旨，內有以平抑國人鬱凝之怨望，外有以正友邦之觀感，凡有損憲法精神之任何舉措，吾人決無法苟同。至選舉進行，必嚴格遵守自由之原則，謹此奉吿大會同仁，敬希亮察」。</p>
<h3>張君勱談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕民社黨主席張君勵，廿六日對副總統選舉問題發表談話：「自民國以還，歷次總統選舉，皆有風潮，此次選舉總統，總算順利產生，詎意副總統競選至決定階段，候選人相牽聲明放棄，掀起軒然大波，此乃對於法治與民主認識不足之故。</p>
<p>所謂法律猶匠人之規矩，憑之以成方圓，不能絲亳挾雜情感與意氣，要有以法律「懸之國門不能易一字」之精神，若憑一己好惡，任意高下其手，不足以言法治，民主政治之要義，須承認公平競爭，一切問題須公開討論，以理由服衆，問題自易解決。英·美政治之可貴，在舉國上下具有一絲不茍之莊嚴守法精神，此種莊嚴守法精神，為立國之本，値得效法。</p>
<p>副總統之人選，本黨原冀國民黨提出一人應選，前會明白宣言，後國民黨以自由競選方式出之一，旣定自由競選，即當尊重代表自由意志之投票，以樹立民主政治之規模，本黨甚盼勿以副總統競選之故引起不良後果，有負國人殷殷之望。</p>
<p>民主國家選舉以前意見紛歧，司空見慣，一經選舉確定，過去種種渙然水釋，吾國行憲伊始，深望養成民主風度，對懸而未決之副總統問題，能本憲法自由競選精神，速得圓滿解決，以免騰一笑中外。</p>

<h3>會椅談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕國大一選舉副總統，因候選人程潛·李宗仁·孫科相繼放棄競選，連日一休會停選，引起中外注目。中國靑年黨主席曾琦，頃發表談話云：此次選舉，余自始即主張兼採「西方民主精神」與「東方禮讓一精神」，故對總統·副總統均不願出而競選，誠以國民黨當國廿年，人才衆多，地位優越，少數黨理宜讓其當選，俾負較多且重的責任，現大總統旣經選出，副總統選舉，忽生彼折，此誠大會之不幸，尤為憲政之危機，余實不勝憂慮，所望競選者，皆能本政治家之風度，以民意為從遠，不因波折而退却，不以失敗而灰心。余嘗謂，政治家宜具三風，曰風度，進退出處，磊落光明，榮辱得失，處之泰然，此風度也。二日風骨，富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈，此風骨也。三曰風誼，揚人之善，成人之美，、急人之急，憂人之憂，此風誼也。能以三風昭示全國，則競選無論成敗，均必為國人所敬仰，如近日三原于髯翁之風範，即可為一實例，昔張江際嘗謂：「得失毀譽，成敗關頤打不破，天下事無可為者，」諸葛武侯自君：「吾心如秤，不能為人作輕重。」余信當國者必均有此雅量，現値戡亂建國之際，宜懍「師克在和」之旨，勿為親者所痛，仇者所快，庶免共產黨竊笑於旁，須知紛爭務宜避免，和諧乃克團結，競選之孫·李·程三君，皆屬同一黨籍，諒無不可和諧之理，余甚盼其能以西人賽球之道德，示國人以憲政之模範，俾大會仍將順利閉幕也。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>不能再使人民失望！</h3>
<p>全國矚目的副總統選舉，兩次投票均因無人獲得過半數票，結果朱能產生副總統；正當國大要舉行第三次投票的時候，三位候選人忽又聲明放棄競選，幾乎引起政治上的軒然大波，不僅使第三次投票無法進行，而且使國大也不得不用休會的方式來鎭壓這一塲的處驚。經過各方面二天的奔走和斡旋，終算冲淡了首都的忿戾之氣，三位候選人均已表示願總候大會之決定，如大會不接受放棄競選之聲明，則仍將繼鐵競選。這一塲的風波雖漸趨於平息，但是首都的戾氣能否完全化為祥和，明天（廿八日）國大能否照常依法舉行第三次投票，實為一大關鍵。所以我們不得不在此向國大代表諸公大聲疾呼，請求你們明天大出席國大投票，都要本着個人的良心行事，不要忘了「一念與邦，一念喪邦」的古訓。代表諸公，千萬不能再使人民失望了！</p>
<p>第一，國人對於國大這次選舉副總統，雖都目為國大最精彩的一齣壓軸戲，萬目睽睽地看着一次二次投票的進行，但並非特別重視副總統之謂。所以在候選人競爭到白熱化的時候，首都雖然充滿了緊張的空氣，但是其他各地始終保持着樂觀的態度；而且莫不認為，不論依照我國憲法的規定，或看民主先進國家的先例，副總統在國家的地位，並不十分重要，在六位候選人之中，不論那一位當選，都能勝任而有餘，並沒有兩樣·所以副總統候選人不諭發表什麼高論卓見，都沒有引起我們老百姓的重視；只是為了國家從此能走上民主憲政的常動，故願這次國大早日完成其合法的程序，如此而己。</p>
<p>第二，　都不否認，民主政治在我國，尙在開始學習的階段，這次國大開會情形的紊亂，固在意料之中，但是代表動亂以「噓」來抵制反對者發言，甚至一言不合，繼之以太打出手，這種專斷變不講理的情形，變在已越出我們黨料之中的限度，自國大開幕之日起，至今將近一月，會塲中幾乎沒有一天不發生吵鬧，我們在各　所載會場花絮中，可以充作笑料的，也幾乎無日無之。這種沒有秩序的國民大會長此開下去，不僅是勞民傷財，徒勞無益；而且對於民主黨政的前途，也是有百審而無一利的。所謂萬事慎於始謀，在跨開大步路上民主憲政的時候，若不能樹立一個良好的規模，則我國民主憲政必無前途可言。所以我們希望國大代表均能反躬自省，出席國大務須尊重法律，嚴守秩序，俾使國大順利進行，早日完成其基本任務。廿五日上午若干代表，因受候選人放棄兌選的刺戟，在會場中恣意呌囂，頓使國大變為人言鼎沸的塲所，這種破壞大會進行討論的行為，縱能獲主席團的寬恕，但是在我們老百姓的眼中，總是無可原諒的。明天國大舉行第三次投蔡，可謂已至最後的關頭，如若再有代表無端取鬧，恣意叫囂，破壞第三次投票的進行，則必為國人所共棄，選民固可依法罷免之，就是在與論界，也應盡其口誅筆伐的能事。</p>
<p>第三，據晚報載稱，某某兩競選團，已成立兩個永久性的組織，一曰「民主憲政運動委員會」，另則定名為「憲政促進會」。據我們自己宣布的宗旨，乃在監督政府推行憲政。我們不問這些國大代表發起組織的動機何在？但是我們不能不指出，自國大開幕以來，這些國大代表的建法掌憲的行動，到處可見，而今不求　己，反而苛責他人，另外成立觀鐵，即使沒有政治陰謀和其他作用，但其結果必造成國大內部的分裂，徒使親者痛仇者快而已。因此我們不得不掬誠為代表諸公吿者，此種使國大分裂的行為，決不是我們老百姓的願望，如果諸公不願民意的向背，一意孤行，勞必激起全國人民的　憤。</p>
<p>第四，這次副總統選舉發生意外的風潮，其起因實由於會內外的流言蜚語，在競選人之間引起　會，有以致之。但副總統候選人，都是黨國元勛，人民領袖，自不致不擇手段，互相攻擊；我們相信這些中傷對方的傳單，必　其助選團之所為，殆無疑　。我們不願苛責這些助選者的過分熱心，但不能不希望候選人能以政洽家寬大的風度來澄淸謠言的來源，使某滅於無形。李孫程三公的從善如洗，接受國大主席團的勸吿，表示願聽候大會決定，仍不失政治家的風度。但願早你李直明朗的表示。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要指出，目前局勢的嚴重，已超過歷史上任何一個時期，共產黨滅亡中國的陰謀，正是先毀滅國民黨，而我們透視國民黨的內層，不可否認的，已瀕於分崩離柏的邊緣，這次競選副總統風潮的發生，就是國民黨內在弱點的暴露，使我們不能不發生無限的憂慮；國大代表諸公縱使不願為國民黨黨員，但亦不願為亡國的奴隸，所以我們不能不要求國大代表，大家提高警覺，加強團結，為推行民主憲政與完成戡亂建國而努力。唯有大家站在一起，精誠團結，民度憲政才會走上正軌。代表諸公，千萬不能再使人民失望了。</p>

<h3>從石柱到重慶的　活仙姑　少女楊妹　九年不食</h3>
<p>這是一　哄勸山城的奇事，同時是一個値得研討的生理現象。記者　　珍先生所報道的只是一個不吃東西的證物，可並不是編造什麽騙人的謊話。其中所揭出的問題，必須讓生理學家·醫學家·或科學家展開他們的研究。（編者）</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿二日訊〕糧伸不步高漲，許多人正在饑餓綫上掙扎，感覺着生活威協的時候，突然　　一個九年不食的石柱少女來渝，這個奇聞該是如何地使人驚奇？為了好奇心的驅使，記者該是到九龍坡國立女子師範學院去訪問，據說「這位　柱少女，當她幼年時代，父母親便早死了，被寄養在伯父家裏·因為伯父家窮，她不能受學校敎育，至今她還沒有名字，人家都稱她「楊味」。</p>
<p>一場怪病　據說楊妹在九年前，一天同一夥鄉間小孩到山坡上挖掘「慈菰」吃，她挖得一個很大的吃了，於是肚痛腹瀉，臥床不起，後來服藥病態後，她就一直不吃食物，到現在已經整整九年了！如果强迫她吃下去，一定立刻發生嘔吐，所以她不會排泄大便，就連小便也很少有。她雖然不進飲食，健康上卻絲亳沒有妨害，她的身體並不瘦削，手和脚的肌肉都十分發雜，面讓紅潤。</p>
<p>來渝之後　最近參議員陪同楊妹來重慶，想找醫藥界檢查她所以不吃食物的道理，他便把她留住在女師學院總務處庶務主任卓松岱家。卓同佘是親戚關係，所以照料她很是周到。卓松岱主任曾經寫下二十個字敎她，不久她便認識了，百試不爽。由此可以證明她的天實並不低劣。可是請問她今年妙齡幾何？她却不知道。從她面貌上估計，大約是廿餘歲。</p>
<p>檢查報告　卓主任的岳母張老太太說：楊妹從來沒有來過月經，她偶爾喝過茶，但立即小解。她吃過生水，却不曾得病。她的牙齒天然潔白，不是刷過的。她確是不吃東西的一件　物，這並不是騙人的謊話。</p>
<p>女師學院衛生組主任徐琴書小姐檢査結果，說楊：妹赤身裸體，讓我檢査，並沒有與常人相異的地方，脈膊，心臟跳動都很正常，肺部也合健康標準，乳房雖不十分發達，但不是變態。只是腹部不大，用聽筒按腹部時，只有水被擠的聲音，大概就是肚子裏沒有裝食物之故。</p>
<p>不願娶她　楊妹九年不吃一物，在饑餓綫上掙扎的人聽來該是一個值得羨慕的福音，可是她的未婚夫因了這唯一的緣故　和她解除了婚約。後來她伯父再替她訂娼，結　也還一樣，這未婚夫照例不願娶不進飲食的女人，於是她只得孤苦伶仃地生活着。人們高高興興地談論着九龍坡上的活仙姑，然而她自己並沒有找尋到或者享受到人生的幸福哩。（魏雪珍）</p>

<h3>大阪神戶韓橋騷動示威　美軍宣布緊急戒嚴　日文部省稱不撤回封閉韓僑學校命令　被檢舉韓日人達九百餘名</h3>
<p>〔合衆社神廿廿六日電〕美軍總部廿六日下令全面兜捕上週末暴動之日本共產黨與朝鮮人。按此為宣佈臨時成嚴令後之第一道正式命令。中國憲兵現正巡邏神戶地區，以預防新事件之爆發。日本警察於臨時緊急戒嚴時期內，由神戶基地美憲兵司令米諾赫指揮。</p>

<p>〔合衆社大坂坂六日電〕此間朝鮮人一萬名，廿六日獲得官方允許，遊行示威，綁去日本警察兩人，二小時後始加以安然釋放，同時各方跡象表示，共產黨正煽動是項騷動，以便在南韓五月十日大選一事上，使美國難堪，示威韓人在大坂市政府前集合，而韓人領袖則入內與日本官員商討韓僑學校引起之糾紛。東京日本全國警察總署稱獲悉共黨已奉令在日本全境策動韓人示威，而於五月十日在東京舉行巨大之遊行。又稱五月節，日本各要城　均將有示威，朝鮮人之參加者將被置於顯著地位，本州西部山口縣於五月六日亦將有遊行。報紙稱：朝鮮人之示威乃共產黨綱領之一部份，以騷擾美國而勸韓人抵制大選。第八軍報吿，神戶暴動案中被捕為首肇事者七人乃日本共產黨員。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕今晨朝鮮羣衆之增援者，自京都奈良神戶區前趨大阪。該地有韓僑一千五百餘人，手執木棍及辣椒粉，鏖集於縣府前。今晨十一時，自京都通大阪之公路上，約有韓僑一千三百人。自奈良區前來之韓僑約一千人，自兵庫繞神戶前來者，約八百人。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕日文部省次官有光次郎今晨稱，過去數日內大阪神戶方面有情勢嚴重之韓僑暴動，但日政府將不撤回其所頒佈之關閉日境韓僑學校之命令。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕被譴責支持韓人在日暴動之日共黨，本日發表正式聲明，支持韓人之行動。</p>
<p>〔社合社神戶廿六日電〕神戶情形已見平靜，憲兵車每輛兵四人，武裝巡邏。大阪仍大</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿六日電〕麥帥總部發表美第八軍司令官艾契培格中將就大阪神戶韓僑與日警衝突事件所發表之特別聲明稱：「四月廿四日韓人約千名包圍縣政府，故意割斷電綫，搗毀器具，並監禁縣知事，警察署長市長等。此項事件美軍方面決定之解決辦法為：（一）過去所枸禁之韓人一律釋放；（二）最近封閉之韓僑學校一律恢復；（三）參加不法事件之韓人應即依法起訴；（四）處罰此次事件之參加者。」又據美軍方面稱：「此次事件中已被檢舉之有關韓人及日本共產黨份子，至廿六日止，已達九百四十三名之多。」</p>
<h3>大阪神戶韓僑暴動主因係不滿日本帝國　韓僑協會對美記者談話</h3>
<p>〔聯合社神廿六日電〕韓僑協會宣傳組今日向聯合社記者稱，大改與神戶韓僑暴動，並非共產黨煽動，實乃大衆不滿日本帝國主義之發作。本會有會員六十萬人，在日韓僑總數約六十一萬人。另有一萬韓僑與本會及靑年協會聯繫，促進韓國獨立。本會與其他各團體雖有一部份共產黨人，但並非政治團體。</p>
<p>此次起事並非如東京軍政府所謂受少數人煽動，軍政府曾命韓僑服從韓僑學校中之日本敎育制度。韓僑之敎育，人人至為關切，甚至韓國本國之人亦然，若輩對於日人干涉其敎育，憤慨殊甚。韓人正與東京敎育當局綱續談判地方學校問題，但尙未獲圓滿答復。余望此間不致發生紛擾，但端視日人之態度為定。按東京市敎育局曾命韓人服從日人敎育制度否則封閉學校。選舉前夕朝鮮各地不靖</p>

<p>〔合衆社漢城廿六日電〕美軍廿六日宣稱，通往大邱美軍營之電話綫，廿五日晚業已為人割斷，但所有電話綫已於廿六日修復。大邱附近有暴徒十人襲擊當地瞥年協會之主席，該主席亦係當地選舉委員會會員。此項憲章各國不受約束</p>

<h3>提前結購油外匯預配一個月用煤　調整售價公式是否廢棄待商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業間接貼補問題，市府連日向中央銀行接洽公用事業所需燃料油及汽油先結匯一個月，經不斷商談，已獲成就。全部共計約國幣二千五百億，其中上海電力公司佔二千億。款由其自行設法，其他各公用事業公司佔五百億，所需款項經吳市長特准，暫在節約用電罰款項下撥偕，依銀行利息計算。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕關於公用事業間接貼補問題，經市府與中央銀行燃料管理會洽商後，對提前結匯及預購煤觔兩項，原則業已談妥，對公用事業各公司購買燃料油，汽油所需外匯，設法予以提前結匯一個月，即如四月份結取五月份外匯。所需煤觔，亦予以預先配與一個月煤量，約五萬噸。惟燃管會目前煤觔存底過少，故現需搶運秦皇島煤觔來滬，以資供應。據公用局負責人談稱：各項間接貼補，希望能於本月份實現，公用事業售價始得穩定，惟生活指數及五金指數二項，頗成問題，電話成本以生活指數及五金指數為主，電車，公共汽車等成本中，亦以生活指數為主，目前無法法抑低。如八大公用事業成本中各項元素（外匯燃料五金指數生活指數等）皆能照前一月份計算，則其價當不再調整矣。又公用事業自動調整公式，於五月份中是否暫停應用，公用局刻正待行政院之指示，據悉政院並將於日內召開會議，加以商討，必要時公用局長趙曾珏當晋京列席報吿。</p>

<h3>文光廷控訴案地檢處昨偵訊　覓保時法警索賄　檢察官表示懷疑　警察分局對文宣告無罪不服</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近自思南路看守所保釋之胡興華翻砂廠工人文光廷，前曾具函向參議會控訴警員非刑逼供，法警索賄等情，地檢處昨日偵訊該案，由梁慶舜檢察官傳文光廷·田阿炳·田良泉·徐敬寬等人訊問，未均予飭回。　文昨到庭時，着藍布工裝上衣，灰布長褲，膠底球鞋，文係湖南人，年約二十餘歲。昨日檢察官訊間範圍，僅係法警有無索賄情形一部份。至文之被控盜匪與竊盜，以及警察局有無刑求情形，因屬於審判範圍，昨未涉及。據文供稱：法警徐敬寬向其紫賄五百萬元，係在請合興翻砂廠作保時，因老閻田阿炳不在廠中，廠中無人負責在保單上蓋章，於返地院途中，徐向文所提出之要求。檢察官對此供詞表示懷疑，因無保必然　押，斷無於交保不成之後，再向文索賄之理。繼詰以曾給錢與法警否？答：「沒有」。幷稱：「我自己袋中一個錢都沒有，交保時乘車往返車資八萬元，尙係向合　翻砂廠借來。』嗣傳田阿炳訊問，田稱文來覓保之日，適因事外出，至晚方歸，因渠不在家，其他人不敢負責，惟渠稱對文願意作保。田良泉稱，曾將保單送至地院，其他情形不知。</p>
<p>徐警寬否認需索　謂且曾貼去狀紙</p>
<p>末傳法警徐敬寬，徐係法警中年齡最輕者，曾在曉光中學初中肄業，對被控事至為沮喪，據稱不獨未向文需索一文，且貼去狀紙一份，因交保無着，仍押回交與推事，渠之責任　　，至推事如何處理，則不得而知，今忽遭如此橫誣，心中異常難受云云。</p>
<p>據從可靠方面探得該案內幕，文光廷後來補交保單被擱置，及判決書送達被吿較　，使文光廷多羈押若干時日，法院方面亦有處置事務遲綏之嫌。</p>
<p>傳係訟師播弄</p>
<p>文無罪被押，心中懷恨，適有胡姓「訟師」，亦因案被押，且亦由曹祖慰推事審理，文談及該案情形，胡遂代文撰密吿函送參議會控吿，一方而代文洩憤，一方面亦打擊曹推事，又因其中情節平淡，遂揑造法警代推事索賄五百萬元之消息，以聳動視聽　　新市街警察分局方面，以文之盜匪案被法院宣判無罪，表示不服，昨具狀法院聲請覆判。</p>

<h3>南運解禁人心與奮　棉紗買氣旺盛　四干支監鳳較週末漲四百萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因南運禁令取銷，激動買方人心，外路港粵漢口等帮採辦不寂，塲內買氣頓濃，漲風趨烈。四十二支藍鳯細紗，初開即躍升四百萬，為二億三千五百萬元。嗣本客兩帮扒吸，又加檯面帮之拉抬，市價扶搖直上，再創二億三千七百萬元之新高峯。迨至近收，浮空獲利了吐，回低至二億三千六百萬元結束。比上週末績漲四百萬。　四十二支寳光及金城等亦升四五百萬元，廿一支雙馬紗客帮以市氣轉俏，吸納甚勒，本街亦有進取，軋升達六百萬。其餘二十支及十六支十支卅二支等粗細紗，亦均再挺六七百萬至半成左右</p>
<p>棉布略升　昨日棉布市况，以紗布南運解禁，人心頓告興奮，散戶不斷哄抬，龍頭細布初開即躍高至五百零八萬元，旋以客帮有納，價再挺高至五百十三萬元，後以吐售者多，疾退至四百九十七萬元有成交。迨至近收，因紗價堅昂，浮空抵補，市價再見回挺至五百零二萬元結束。比上週末續漲十二萬元，其餘各細布及白坯布色布士林布等，亦都見挺秀。</p>
<p>紡建售紗　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司，昨（廿六日）循例開售棉紗十二種，售價如下：二十支天女一三九〇〇萬元，十支豐年八四〇〇萬元，十支立馬八〇〇〇萬元，十六支紅月一〇三〇〇萬元，卅二支五彩星一七三〇〇萬元，卅二支雙股仙桃一八〇〇〇萬元，四十二支豐鳥一八三〇〇萬元，四十二支雙股立馬二二二〇〇萬元，四十支TK彩球二二二〇〇萬元，六十支日光二三五〇〇萬元，六十支雙股燒毛口光三〇九〇〇萬元，一百支雙股燒毛日光十三億元。申購單合計四七六張，售出棉紗九六〇件，合廿支紗一五二三·五件。</p>
<p>現棉帶堅　昨日現棉市况，因紗布南運解禁，棉紗收盤砌高，業中人心激昂，市况帶堅。尤以同業銀根鬆弛，塲上供售甚少，喊價哄抬甚高。終以官方開盤收價仍未提高，執生不售，交易中途擱淺，成交寥寥。靈寳做開送公庫價為二五三〇萬，啓東二二五〇萬，周浦籽花四八五萬</p>
<h3>汽油配量減少將以酒精代替</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近本市汽油分配量已日見減少。工業運輸業以需用遭受影響，均感業務無法擴展。茲據記者探悉，現該兩業正設法以酒精代替汽油。蓋目下台灣各糖廠酒精生產量極多，而國內粵，閩，渝，贛等省製造糖蜜時亦均能生產大量酒精，同時上海，重慶兩地之酒精廠亦可因酒精用途增廣而恢復開工。本市工商輔導處有鑒及此，刻已擬具詳細代用辦法，呈請經濟部審核中云</p>
<h3>錢莊小額貸款提高放款限額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市錢莊合組小額信用貸款銀團辦理小工商業貸款，將近三月。據統計：放出貸款，小工業以針織襪廠最多，小商業則以烟紙雜貨店居首。他如大餅，豆腐，雜糧等店，均有貸出。茲該幽以邇來物價劇漲甚巨，為適應小工商業實際需要計，已將貸額提高至每戶以國幣一千二百萬元為限，仍可分三個日拔還云。</p>

<p>中信局於廿六日下午，曾召集有關方面會議。決定將桐油收購價改訂，滬梧兩地，每擔為九五〇萬元。穗地為一〇五〇萬元。</p>
<h3>猪鬃出口情形　今年已見好轉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近我國猪鬃出口情形，已漸趨好轉。統計過去三月中之輸出量，已較去年下半年增加甚多。據悉主要原因係因美國戰時發明之尼龍，並不足以代替猪鬃。故戰後一般毛刷工廠，仍逐漸改用猪鬃。至我國猪鬃之主要出口地點，仍為美國·其次則因淸償債務關係，有一部份輸往蘇聯。歐洲方面，則因缺乏美元關係，故輸出極少。</p>
<h3>庫券發行折扣並無硬性規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕短期庫券之發行日期，迄未決定，外界雖多推測之辭，但國行人員始終不肯證實。劉副總裁上星期六由京返滬後，亦僅表示發行技術問題，尙待研討。昨日此間其金融當局表示：庫券發行目的，在安定市塲，穩定金融，不致影響一般行莊業務，至於發行折扣則將由國行決定，財部事前並無八五折之硬性規定。</p>
<h3>受港電縮刺激　永紗創新高價</h3>
<p>華股昨港電之刺激圈外之推動，仍能邁步前晋，但中途以證券帮力有未逮，頗為吃力。永紗雖創高峯，但小股反有不進而退者。晨初即受種種利買因素，若港電等刺激而見秀。永紗開高至二一〇〇元，開後新華勤興仰高而回，外匯牌價未更，永紗亦退至二〇三五元，二〇五號等來維持，升為二〇五五元。一八〇號等尙有了結，低至二〇三八元。外股飛升，港電頻縮，人心被激，交易雖少，以進取者多，近午漲達二一〇五元，雜牌疲草莫能興。午收為二〇八七元。較上週六計商務中法平平，勤與國貨永業跌半成，餘均微升。一</p>
<p>後市上塲永紗即升為二一一五元，雖經進至二一二〇元，但以了結者多，復退至二〇九〇元。一八三號等來進，三時後，國行雖有大量差進，但買風反在銀行帮及證券帮掀動下而見盛，永紗升至二一四〇元收市，已屬新高價。統益忽遭二二〇號等狂吸，上升不少，中絲亦有漲停表演。結果較晨收計華新統益中絲國貨升半成，信誼尙平，勤興小挫，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票，除公用股平疲外，餘均平定。</p>
<h3>統債穩健　外股邁進</h3>
<p>公債昨仍見穩健，統丙自一〇萬八開　後，遂漸盤升至一一萬五結束。較上週六計甲乙丁各升四千元，丙漲六千五，戊種好起三千元，成交不過四百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨受港電之加强刺激，突飛猛晋，怡紗晨開即升為二九五萬，扶搖直上昂至三二〇萬新價結束。證券帮了結，洋行帮廣幫買進，結果較上週六計會德豐業廣怡　各漲成半，怡紗藍格志好一成，餘股一致漲起半成强。存底涸竭，一起買風，羅掘為難，漲勢强烈，仍有新紀錄可能。</p>

<p>廠絲昨市再升，C字等級同行做開四億〇五百萬元，有二檔成交。高另担做三億九千萬元，雙虎做九千五百萬元，比上週六俱大二千萬元之譜。收繭貸款自墊二成中，可以廠絲抵押一成，故市上現貨勢必缺少，人心於是看好。千經交易殊稀，行情穩定。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市先昇後略降，眞絲被面終比上週六大起八百萬元之左，華强貨開市哄至一億六千萬元，旋即退至五千九百萬元左右盤旋，收市又降至五千六百八十萬元。大誠格子壁縐收市喊五十六萬元，其他各貨，亦均提升百分之五至十不等。</p>
<h3>食米晨開喊高　後市終告回平</h3>
<p>米市跟錫價之報升而欲挺上，貨主喊高價格，力圖提升，晨市挺升十萬元，惟屬勉强拉上，蓋實銷依然不振，即使提高價格，亦屬徒然。後市仍見回平，結果較上週六升五萬至十萬元，獨白元因値暢銷之令，致上漲二十萬元，為四百三十萬。北市亦早挺後　，軋升十萬之譜。特高粳重抵四百十五萬，升十五萬元，到貨四千三百八十石。</p>
<p>麺粉　開市後，在北帮之納取下，一度微漲，惟以納胃不多，後市即以去路不活而回落。兵船粉最高一百四十二萬，收市一百四十萬，與上週六同價。老車略升五千，紅蜂升七千元，雜牌粉中市開出，價都上挺。麩皮降萬元，小包麩後市六十三萬，小麥價不動。</p>

<h3>懷黑德論：大學的任務</h3>
<p>— 佐禹</p>
<p>大學的任務或使命是什麽？我們為什麽要花許多錢來設大學？這問題，教育家或政治家，自有各種不同的答案。最近逝世的英哲懷黑德教授（Prof．A．N．Whitehead），曾寫過一篇「大學及其職能」(Universities　and　Their　Fuuction）一文，其中有幾段話，涉及大學的任務，很值得我們注意。以下就打算介紹他這幾段話。</p>
<p>懷氏認為大學固是教育的學校，及是研究的學校。但大學存在的主要的理由却不是光把知識灌輸給學生，也不是光為教授們供給研究的機會。自這兩種機能來說，這可以用很低的代價獲得，不必要這種很花錢的機構。因為書籍是便宜的，而學徒制度也是周知的。大學的任務若只在灌輸知識，則自十五世紀印刷普遍以後，大學便沒有存在的理由。可是大學的風起雲湧却在十五世紀以後，最近尤為熱鬧。這證明了大學的任務自不在純然知識的灌輸。</p>
<p>大學存在的理由，依懷氏意，乃在保持知識和生侖精華間的聯繫，在結合靑年人和老年人對於學問共作想像的探討。大學是灌輸知識的，然這是想像的灌輸知識。至低限度，想像的灌輸知識是大學應該替社會做到的任務。一間大學若不執行這種任務，這大學即沒有存在的理由。蓋由想像的探討而產生的一種興奮的空氣是可以改變知識的。有了想像，一個事實便復不是純然的事實。這事實便加進了一切牠的可能性。這事實對於我們的記憶即不復是一種負担。這事實即努力工作者，像我們夢中的詩人，像我們目的的建築師一樣。</p>
<p>懷氏所謂「想像」（Imagination）,他認為是不能和事實分離的。想像乃是照耀事實的一種方式。想像的工作在提出那些過用於存在的事實的普遍原理，然後再用一種理知的　觀去提出和這些原理一致的其他可能性。想像使人們構造出一個新世界的一種理知遠景，復由滿足目的的啟示保存了生命的精華。</p>
<p>青年人是想像的。如靑年人的想像能由紀律的訓練而增強，則這種想像能力是大部分可終身保持的。世界的悲劇是，那些富有想像的人卻缺少經驗，而富有經驗的人卻想像力弱。愚者無知識而只依想像而行，遷者無想像而只依知識而行。一間大學的任務即在把想像和經驗結合為一。、</p>
<p>以上懷氏這幾段話，自想像力弱的人看來，也許認為過於抽象，過於空泛。可是在這些頗為抽象的言說裏，懷氏是把促進文化，創造文化的任務交給了大學。創造或發明，不能缺少知識或經驗，尤不能缺少想像或玄想。老年人有經驗或知識，卻缺少想像。青年人有想像，卻缺少知識經驗。大學集合靑年人和老年人在一起，即志在把想像和經驗治為一爐。以靑年的想像補充老年，而以老年的經驗傳給青年。這就是大學的任務。</p>
<h3>亞里士多德哲學的分類</h3>
<p>— 一指</p>
<p>關於哲學的分類，亞里自己的意見不大一致，並且他的書並不同他的分類完全相符。有時他把全部哲學分兩部分，就是理論的（Theoretocal）和實踐的（Practical；有時他還加上第三部分，呌做創造的（Prlductive）。此外，他在另一地方把一切問題分為三種：（一）邏輯上的，（二）物理上的，（三）倫理上的，第一種問題包含兩部分，即眞正邏輯問題與形而上學的問題；—這種分法幾乎和柏拉關的相同，（參閱拙著柏拉圖，世界書局哲學業書）大概他當時就是受了柏氏的影響才這樣分。</p>
<p>案前一個分法，則埋論部分包括地理學，數學，形而上學（亞氏呌做第一哲學）或神學；實踐部分包括倫理學，政治學，創造部分，他所發揮的（或所流傳的）只是詩學和修詞學兩門。此處所謂物理學，除物理學本門以外，還包括生物學，心理學等，—總而言之，包括全部關於自然界的學問。至於邏輯與修詞學，則二者都始工具，不是哲學的本門，邏輯是全部哲學—或整個學問—的工具、修詞學是政治學的工具。他所以把修詞學看作政治學的工具，大概還是因襲當時一般社會的見解，以為這門學問是政治舞臺上的利器，政治家操此術可以折衝一切。而得政治上的勝利。當時所謂辯士們（The　sophists），就是專門傳授此術的人。</p>
<p>亞氏所以把哲學分為理論，實踐，創造，三部分，是因為各部分之所趣向目的不同。廣義上說，一切學問都離不開知識。但是狹義上語，鉀論部分目的在認識（Copnitoin），純粹的知識是它的對象；實踐部分目的在動作，人類的行為是它的對象；創造部分目的在造作，有川或美麗的作品是它的對象。實踐部分是倫理學與政治學的範圍，創造部分是藝術的範圍；可是它們卻有相同之點，就是它們的對象同是能變的，—事方面的行為能變，物方面的作品也能變。且聽亞氏自已的話：</p>
<p>「人性有兩部分：理性部分與非理性部分。理性部分還可以分，就說也分兩部分：（一）和不變的事物發生關係的。（二）和變的事物發生關係的；因為外面的世界旣有不同的對象，內面的人性也有不同的部分和它們相應，本來知識之所以可能，就因為人性中有和它們相應的部分。我們且把前者呌做思想的部分，後者呌做籌劃的部分。「（Nicomaichean　Ethics，BK．-　VI　」　　　　　，514）</p>
<p>「變的事物包括造成的物和行出的事。造與行不同，所以造的本能與行的本能也不同，二者的範圍不相侵犯。……一切藝術都和「生成」之事有關，換句話說，藝術的職志在於考究如何使可有可無的東西成有；同時這種東西的來源不在它本身，而在造成它的作者。藝術和那些必然存在，成自然存在而來源在其本身的事物無干。「（Nicomacgean　Ethics，BK．VI．1140a-16）</p>
<p>根據亞氏自己的話，可見他所以把哲學分成這三部分，乃是因為人性有這三種本能。據他看，人性可分兩大部分，即理性的與非理性的。非理性的不論，只就理性的說，又有兩部分：（一）思想部分（Contemplative　part）。（二）籌劃部分（Calculative　part），——前者和不變的事物發生關係，後者和變的事物發生關係。變的事物有兩種，一種是人所行的事，一種是人所造的物，因此在人性方面也有兩個不同的本能和這兩種不同的對象相符應，就是。由籌劃部分再分出來的行的本能與造的本能。</p>
<p>實踐部分分倫理學與政治學，其實亞氏把倫理學看作政洽學的一部分。他的政治學有兩部分：（一）論個人行為的，（二）論國家行為的，前者是倫理學，後者是眞正的政治學；此外，他還把經濟，戰術，修詞，等歸入政治學的附庸。柏拉圖把政治學現為倫理學的一部分，他的倫理學分個人倫理與社會倫理，其實前者是倫理學，後者是政治學。表面上，好像亞氏的看法恰恰和柏氏的相反，實際上正是相同；——柏氏以倫理為網，把個人與社曾聯貫起來，亞氏以政治為綱，把個人與國家籠絡起來，這樣也好，那樣也好，反正個人與社會國家離不開，國家社曾的行為能左右個人的行為。</p>
<h3>老子論聖人與衆人</h3>
<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>道德經第二十章曰：「絕學無憂：唯之與阿，相去幾何？善之與惡，相去若何？人之所長，不可不畏，—荒分其未央哉—衆人熙熙，如事太牢，如登春　；我獨泊分其未兆，如嬰兒之未孩，儡儡若無所歸。衆人皆有餘，而我獨若遺。—我，愚人之心也哉，沌沌兮。俗人昭昭，我獨昏昏；俗人察察，我獨悶悶。澹兮其若海，　兮若無止。衆人皆有以，而我獨頑且鄙。我獨異於常人，而貴食母。」此章蓋論聖人與衆人之別，茲詮釋之，以質學者。</p>
<p>「絕學無憂，」開下兩句。「唯」與「阿，」雖有差，皆應聲耳；「善」與「惑，」雖有別，猶相對也。此皆凡人之學之所辨者。凡人為學，囿於凝同之概念，拘於一貫之思律（Law　of　the　Consistencyof　Thought），唯則不阿，善則非惑；苟通之以「道，」則互異者可至於同，相反者有以相及；—是凡人之學，見異而不見同，不能泯相對於絕對之中也。今茲所絕，此等學耳，以其徒勞心志，而益滋昏迷；若夫為道之學，奚可絕也？人之所畏？常在異同·相對·之間，若唯與阿·若善與惡·之倫；人畏而我不可畏者，猶「時中」之義，迎人之權耳，若夫其實，則荒兮其去道遠矣。「央」者，中也；「未央，」猶言未中道也。蓋世亂俗迷，得道之士，溷迹其中，明哲保身，以俟其變，逮其勢（謂相反相及之勢）至，則助之反，挽而復之於道，而有以致於太平郅冶焉。顧聖人外雖溷迹以保身，中實皦然守道，其所操常異乎衆人之撰，故下文輒有「衆人……」云云·「我獨……」云云。之辨，以見聖人之終異乎衆人也。「熙熙，」應作擾攘解，太牢之享，春臺之登，人所競趨，—此喻衆人孜孜矻矻於唯阿善惑之末學，荒兮其未中夫「道」也。「泊」，舟附岸之謂；「兆」，形象也。「泊兮其未兆，」喻守道無適，泯跡象於渾淪之中，不若用智於末學者之圭角畢露，—有如嬰兒之未能笑，好惡宋萌，　　然無可無不可，故「若無所歸」也。「家人皆有餘，」謂衆人「為學日益」；「我獨若遺」，謂聖人守道於中，於形下之末學有所未邊，是以「若遺」；雖然，聖人之潰夫形下之學，非眞遺也，聖人志在道而不在器，常守「道紀」，時焉執古以御今，輒無往而不通，故能「不行而知，不見面名，不為而成」焉。「愚人」者，聖人以視衆人，輒若愚人；聖人之智內斂，不逐物以為智，純純然無識無知，自衆人觀之，其愚不可及，—此大智之所以若愚也。「昭昭」「察察」，衆人小智之外溢；「昏昏」「悶悶」，聖人大智之內斂。衆人用智於物，故有昭昭察察之效，聖人用智於道，道無形象，是以昏昏悶悶。顧聖人之昏昏悶悶，非如衆人以下之昏昏悶悶也，聖人用智而超智，唯道是從，不役於物，故能昏昏悶悶。蓋唯用智而超智者，乃有昏昏悶悶之效；世臻昏昏悶悶之境，然後太平有日。目今西人之理智文明，非所謂昭昭察察者耶？唯其用智而不能超智，斯為智役，寖致於攘奪殘殺，而人道苦矣。「海」者，完整之象，無所不容之象。漚波之起伏，海水之表耳。漚彼之起伏增减，無有於海水之完整。聖人之言語行動，道體之用也，言語行助因時制宜，隨境取適，而守道不渝，是以「若海」；且唯其匪所不容，乃無偏好偏惡，所以澹也。「颼兮」猶漂兮。聖人守道，道，懸虛者也，應物而不著物，故能役物而下役於物，是以「無止」，—「無止」，猶云無所繫繋也。「衆人皆有以」，承上「有餘」而言，謂衆人以末學為智，厥智不能懸虛，執著乎形下之器物，其效顯而易見，輒若有所把握也者。「我獨頑且鄙」，承上昏昏悶悶而言，昏昏悶悶，衆人視之，誠若頑且鄙焉。「母」者，道也；道，萬物所自生，道與物，猶母子然。「食母」，猶言「守母」，即守道也。人皆逐物，我獨守道，此聖人之所以異於衆人也。</p>
<h3>謠言心理（三）</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>華盛頓的謠言在上午發生，下午便傳遍舊金山了。原因是個個人都想先將這一個消息告訴另一個人。你祇要看一個傳播謠言者，當他問你：「你知道這一個消息麽？……」你回答不知道時，那時候他的眉飛色舞的得意情形，你便可以看出來，說出一個你不知道的消息或謠言，是多麽令人滿意與興奮的事！因此，每一個保持着一種謠言者，便都用極大的速度來傳播它。謠言的傳播便等於一種比賽，你傳播得慢一步，別人會捷一足先登，你便沒有機一會得着那打陂消息的勝利感了。這種競賽一般的心情，便如風吹野火似的，使它急速地掠過廣大的原野。</p>
<p>軍隊與稠密的城市是謠言的理想傳播地區，原因便在其接觸的繁密。要謠言發生作用，便要謠言傳播得快，要謠言傳播快，自然要在人與人接觸多的所軍在。隊與城市便最理想了。他們不但距離近，而且興趣也相似，利害多相同。這樣，謠言從一個人的嘴邊極快傳到另一個人的耳中了。要是沒有共司的興趣與利害，則「言者諄諄，聽者藐藐」，謠言是不會一風行」的。有時候，甚至祗是因為要找一點談話的材料——動聽的材料——一個人不難製造一些謠言來講講。為要使其動聽，他或者不得神秘其事，裝着十分秘密似的。這種「耳語」，常常是一些最危險的謠言——最沒有事實根據，但最動聽的。</p>
<p>謠言在一個人的嘴邊是沒有多大力量的。因為一個人旣然不能相信官方的消息，他自然也難得輕信一個人嘴邊的話語。但一個謠言由一人傳十，十人傳百，以後整個社會都在傳播這種謠言時，即使你是一個最謹愼的人，你也會被謠言所撼動的。在「四面楚歌」的局面下，鐵心漢亦會投降的，沒有一個人能够抵抗住全面的暗示。相信自已的兒子如曾母的，但當她聽見全城的人都說她的兒子殺人時，她也不得不為所動了。所以有些謠言，雖然明明是自已傳出去的，自已明明知道其來源完全不可能的，但經一傳再傳，直到全社會都如此傳說時，他自己亦不敢不相信其眞實性了。羣衆的力量是如此偉大！你或者不相信，可是事實確如此：謠言不但欺騙聽謠言的，它常常也迷惑着造謠者的本人。　（續完）十九</p>
<h3>學林樷語　（十九）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>政界風氣</p>
<p>梁任公家書中有論及民國初年政界風氣的話，現在已經隔了二三十年，依然值得我們反省和深念。地述民初北平政象有云，「兩月以來，在西河沿一帶運動　　缺者七萬餘人。人人皆搶　分之想，中國之大患在此」。他曾說中國靑盲之疾，乃在舉國聰明才智之士，悉輻集於政治之一途。任公非反對作官者，特謂非轉移風氣，則政治無淸明之望。而欲轉移風氣，挽救時弊，語其大要，亦不外乎曾文正公所倡忠誠與拙誠二者而已。</p>
<p>任公以為凡言政黨，首宜重義利之辨。彼見利忘義之徒何足稱為黨人？「權利二字一　，則爭盜並出，或陰或陽，其來無方。入其中者，必狡險辣毒與之相敵而後可。今乃知孟千不言利之深　著明也。又論造黨非嚴守紀律接近民衆心鉀不可。其語均不廢。</p>
<p>任公嘗持「人才經濟」之說，謂凡人欲自效於國家或社會，最宜用其所長。又謂天下事無所謂大小，只要在自己責任內盡自已力量做去，便是第一等人物。任公自稱向來辦事在求好副手，為領袖者當勞于用人而逸于治事。其論團體行動之重要，有日，「我之代人受過，總是免不了的，但因此頗感覺沒有團體的苦痛。朋友中有能力的人確不少，道德學問和宗旨都是對的，但沒有團體的一致行動，不惟不能發揮其勢力，而且往往因不一致之故，取消勢力，眞是可痛」。（五十五歲時語）又謂欲因人以成事，必屈己以徇人，此乃絕有心得之語。</p>
<p>任公又謂「今日欲成大事，萬不可存一同門不同門之界。辦天下之大事，非盡收天下之豪傑不可」。「我同門之一弊，必其人之才力受我節制，然後納而受之，此必不得豪傑也。其人為易受節制者，才必不如，我得之何益。蓋必出盡方法以收羅難駕駛難節制之人然後可也。然欲收羅之，非恃小小術數，亦曰關達大度開誠布公而已」。此語可謂針對我國政治上之病原。任公嘗曰，「吾閱事多滋懼」。又日「疇昔旁觀批評，謂天下事一二語可了，今乃眞不敢輕于責人也」。此寥寥數語，寶含有不少之隱痛。</p>
<p>政治之根本在教育，且非僅為　義之學校教育，而為廣義之社會教育。任公在淸季有言曰，「西哲言代議士為國民心理上之影像，現代諮議局議員旣略寫此影僚與我輩以共見矣」。民國二年，任公憤欲與政治絕綠。五年會與同志約，俟軍事稍平，決當獻身於社會教育，孔子所謂是亦為政也。他以為中國之大患在學問不昌，道德淪廢，非從社會教育痛下功夫，國勢殆不可救。欲謀政治之根本改革，須從國民心理入手，欲改造國民心理，須從社會教育入手，社會教育主要之工具為與論，與論之靈魂為思想，故思想乃創造新時代之原動力。此一貫之理論實為不刋之眞理。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>爝火</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>火的發明是人類一件大事，所以神話裏才有被幽囚的普米修士，希臘學者把他演為垂名永久的大戲劇。雖然乃是寓言，但我們可以想像原始人在能够利用火之前，必有許多人犧牲於此，小孩子無知識。因玩火而灼傷皮廣。是其例證。老子所云「兵猶火也·不　將自焚」，看起來平常·其實却包含了若干慘痛。神話裏祝融氏作大火戰勝榆罔（？），直到明代陸西星作封神傳，還保留着火德眞君羅宜的故事，若不是龍吉公主的凈水瓶，西岐城險些做了灰燼。以此，兒時每逢到火神廟，，對於那位比醉漢面孔還要紅，額部又生了一隻「電眼」的偶像，不免有莫名的恐怖。</p>
<p>也許我所見到的太偏於使人神經衰弱的一面，水蒸氣和電都是火發出來的，沒有他人類會有現代的幸福嗎？話是很對，灼傷人毀屋宇的火可以給我們拖車開機器　，使整個世界改了面目，唯物論者把歷史進展的中心置於工具之使用，其實何妨即放在火上。不但近代資本主義生產的底子—機器是靠火發動，就是古時冶鐵冶銅，那一種不靠火？原始人用石器，正是尚未知道火的時代。不過，這樣偉大的火也就闖了莫大的禍，社會的躍進使生產的火燄變成了戰火，人們所受的苦難與所享的樂利幾乎不能平衡。激進的人從此更加不能忍耐，而這一星未被壓滅的火種，也往往總有一天會烈燄騰空，演成了燎原之勢。</p>
<p>推想普羅米修士偷火給人間，當然是天上羣仙，飽享火的光明與幸福—神仙不火食，這話是胡說，若是眞有神仙，而神又是正直聰明的話，他們一定先懂得用火燒東西。—而人間尚在蒙昧檮元之中，食血寢皮的階段，所以才有這樣大胆而慷慨的贈予。然則使火延燒，當非普羅氏之初恉。這裏當然得憎恨那些管理火種的執事，為什麼不能因勢利導使他給大多數人作工，燒飯，偏偏製造機會，甚至　火積薪之上。前車雖覆，後轍不遷，人類之愚，蓋亦可以嘆觀止矣。</p>
<p>焚毀，火災，無論怎樣也是不幸。然而黑暗也實在難以禁受。因之想到古人所常說的「爝火之光」，何嘗不是一點光明。電燈誠然很亮，可是對於一個甫自黑暗中出現的人，反而要刺得眼睛睜不開。也許一盞豆油燈或臘燭會更可使人明白見物。慢慢的再把光明擴大。生理學所說的瞳孔漲縮作用，我們總應該知曉。大抵這一綫光明果然能够領導大多數人走路，或如我們的傳說中所　稱的，車武子囊螢而讀，也許就不至於放野火了。那麼，功德也就很不在小。</p>
<p>所謂光明者，正是積爝火而成。古人說得好，江之始流，不過濫觸。孟子便用了這個理由，主張人當發展善端。譬如「火之始然，泉之始達」，火之始燃，大約全是一綫微光，不能如火柴似的，轟然而起。天下事不由一點一滴做成者，往往是禁不住試探與熬鍊，辛亥革命豈非金鑑，古人也曾說：「飄風不終朝，疾雨不終日」，一面是極盛者難乎為繼，一面也是人心對這種東西有些厭煩，所以才說出這種有些忿忿的話。我們該當看做人情，不可呆執為物理。有人對於中國傳統的中庸之道表示澈頭澈尾的反感，不錯，中庸有時會成為頑固的盾牌，然而對於生活之道則是人類一致的要求。寒帶與熱帶都不適於定居，唯溫帶是文化的中心，古時居住亞寒帶的蠻族總是想南下遷徙，中國的匈奴，鮮卑，西洋的諾曼人皆是也。這顯見在生理上有天然趨向中庸的要求，衣食住行，全是以舒適為極度，飛機火車雖是極力發展速率，却也有一限度，若超過了，便不是生理上所能支持，即使有人造養氣可以呼吸也還是不行。中國人在生活上不能說不懂得這些，在哲學上也說得很完滿，一張一弛，一剛一柔，都不差，所差乃是言行不相顧。吾蜚平凡人以及多數百姓所要求的，事實上不是燒灼的野火或冷酷，乃是溫度均匀合適，無奈文化的積累雖多，人民的個體雖衆，這種冷熱不常的長期瘧疾，也足以使之毀滅而有餘。言念及此，殆不能不廢管三嘆，覺得自己欲跳出火坑而無由也。</p>
<h3>梁鴻志之命與相</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>自由談上　雲先生的一篇「相人術」，言及從人的相上，可以看到人的「壽夭」「窮通」「忠奸」「善惡」。在今天，命相之術，一班人都視為迷信，但請教過算命看相先生的人，恐怕還是佔多數的吧？我一向對於算侖看相，不過隨人之後玩玩，並不相信，而梁鴻志的命與相，的確有令人驚異處，茲一述之。</p>
<p>民廿七年，梁承日人之命組織「維新政府」，在上合之前，行踪詭秘，有人言其住在偉達飯店內。一日余在霞飛路遇到友人史文甫·史善相人，兩人同入一咖啡店閒談，史談及最近曾為梁看相，此次如果出來，結果恐不好，余問其故，史言：「梁的兩眼角下垂，其形如豬，豬養肥了，不是總要捱一刀嗎？」此一異也。</p>
<p>梁與黃溶皆有詩名，人稱為黃梁，梁在大學堂讀書，黃在譯學館畢業，在我後一班，余因黃而識梁。民國初年，故都有茹子文者，山東蓬萊縣人，住在西河沿一旅館內，為人算命，極有名。一日余與郭則　及梁同往算命，各人報八字，茹以算盤推算，言：「梁的命最好，但六十歲後，必須歸隱，方可保全。」梁時在京漢路局任一小事，聞此言，頗自喜。後數日，余與黃蘭生在同福樓吃燒鴨，泗後再同到茹處，問梁的命將來好到什麽程度？最後壞到什么程度？茹言：「照我的八卦術推算，樂將來可以做到國務總理的地位，但六十歲後，如不聽我言，急流湧退，，恐有殺身之禍。」此二異也。</p>
<p>日本投降時，南京汪政府人自殺者，只有陳羣一人，陳在自殺前，有　　一短札，言：「當　　立之時，公告我，言敗則　之以死，我今行矣，顧公自愛。」梁得信遲疑不決，卒被槍決，梁之詩文，驚才絕艷，確為一代之才，一念之差，令人有　本佳人之歡，悲夫！</p>
<h3>徐文長論捉刀</h3>
<p>代人作文，已成了近世的習俗，似乎在古代極少此事。偶閱徐文長抄代集小序，其論代人作文極有風趣，特抄於下：</p>
<p>「古人為文章，鮮有代人者，蓋能文者　　則　：顯者貴，求之不得，况令其代；　者高，得之無由，亦安能　之代？渭於文，不幸若馬耕耳，面處於不顯不隱之間，故人得而代之，而渭亦不能　其代。又今制用時義，以故業舉得官者，類不為古文詞，即有為之者，而其所送贈賀啓之禮，乃百倍於古，其勢不得不取諸代，而代者，必士之微，而非隱者也。故於代可以觀人，可以考世。」</p>
<p>由此觀之，代者可悲，世風亦可悲，不知今世名人閱之感想如何？（弘賢）</p>
<h3>決鬥在義大利</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>決鬥在戰後的義大利很是盛行，不過，却也很安全，因決鬥而死的寃鬼，可說沒有。</p>
<p>武器是手鎗和劍聽憑挑選。以手鎗為武器的決鬥佔多數，因為在義大利人的記憶中，沒有一個決鬥者被鎗彈擊中過，雖然曾有幾個助手遭過池魚之殃，被火藥燒燬了褲子。雙方所發射的鎗彈中的火藥的理想的成份，該是緩和的「嗤」的一聲射出來，使子彈一離鎗口就掉下來，沿着地面溫和的向前滾。在決鬥前幾天，武器就先在決鬥塲中試騐過，兩端的距離有三四十碼——就是射擊能手，在這麼遠的距離也會嫌靶子太小。在塲中的兩端各擺兩個紙紮的人型，然後用鎗射擊。假如子彈射及紙靶子，它就不合格；如果穿過紙，火藥的份量就亟應减少。總之，必須試騐出最合理想的火藥份量，然後才能以眞正的人為靶子。</p>
<p>另外一種是用劍決鬥。定劍，聘指導，選擇塲地等費錢的初步工作完成之後，正式的決鬥開始了。決鬥者都脫去了上衣，執着劍，站得遠遠的。指導兼裁判才是決鬥中的眞好漢。他拿了劍，站在雙方的中間，注意他們不要鬥得太近。兩方的劍剛一碰，他就叫；「止步」！然後用自己的劍把他們分開。以後每次兩人走進可能刺到的距離，他都如此做，假如有一方眞想結束對方的生命—不過這是罕有的—他更是急忙用劍擋開。</p>
<p>到最後，兩個人難免筋疲　　的倒了下來，或者指導被刺傷了，或者雙方有一人乎臂受了微傷，或者雙方乾脆的因疲倦而歇手，然後大家吻一下子，一塲烏雲密佈的決鬥就風消雲散了—各自歸家，回去誇口一番。</p>
<h3>是非</h3>
<p>— 少云</p>
<p>物質功利的狂流橫溢，攻訐詭詐的變幻錯綜，已經關得社會昏黑得像一團陳漆，使世界紛亂得比亂麻還難理得一個頭緒來了。因而所謂是非善惡種種倫押標準，好像都動搖了根基。</p>
<p>記得有這麽一個笑話：甲乙二人，同吃一頓筍拌豬肉的小菜，另一位先生看見，因為甲同他好而乙和他有隙，他便大發其「月旦」說：某甲眞節儉，猪肉裏頭還要拌雜些筍片；某乙眞奢華，連筍裏邊也要放猪肉。</p>
<p>這，大概就是今日之所謂「是非」了罷？津津</p>
<h3>寫文章的習慣</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>寫文章的時候，各人有各人的習慣，有人歡喜窗明几净，從容揮毫，每一個字都寫得很工整，手稿便是一本絕妙的字帖。也有人在打牌聲，談話聲聒耳欲聾下，我行我素，一管方在手，專心於有關千古的文章事業。</p>
<p>我在十餘年前，曾替某周刋從大西洋雜誌上譯過一篇談作家的小文，裏面就提起西洋作家寫文章時不同的習慣，有人歡喜喝咖啡，有人歡喜用一個黑人替他搔頭皮，更有人要在房間中安排一股香蕉味，嗅到鼻子中，方才文思如湧，這却近於怪癖了。</p>
<p>就我而論，我也有一些特殊的習慣，我常常歡喜兩三篇文章同時下筆。這一篇文章，寫到文思枯渴時，就丟在一旁，另擇一個題目再寫，寫到差不多的字數後，忽有所悟，再在最先的一篇文章中續下去。如此間隔的在二三篇文章中分段撰寫，有時續寫一二節即可完卷，有時要分五六次寫完，有時甚至就不再寫下去。</p>
<p>其次，有人愛在不同的報章雜誌上，同時發表文章，即所謂「多產作家」是。我却歡喜一篇篇的寫，依次發表，不願意一起送出去。</p>
<p>在漫畫家的筆下，作家的書室，往往凌亂不堪，書報圖畫，堆得滿坑滿谷，紙墨筆硯，更隨處亂放，於此似可反映作者只知寫文掌而不知收拾　愛美觀念的一般。大概作家中十之八九均有道種習慣，如果燙金皮脊的巨著，整整齊齊的放在書架上，大理石筆座上挿着講究的鋼筆，也許反而不易着一字了。</p>
<p>最後，我對於寫文章的工具之一—鋼筆或毛筆，認為各有它的長處。如用鋼筆寫，書寫流暢，可以將一縱即逝的思緒，像賽跑式的把它記下來。假使用毛筆寫，吮筆磨墨，一面寫一面儘可有構思的餘地。總之，就我一得之愚看來，寫記事文須秉筆直書時似以鋼筆較宜，寫深奧的理論文字，則以毛筆為佳，不致於等你想到下文時，筆尖上的墨水却早已滯住了。一</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>人孩子怎樣說話；小孩子長成了靑年，再教他說怎樣的話；好不容易才學會了這一課—說話。一下子年紀老了。人們又娥他嚕　，巴望他頂好別說話。</p>
<p>舞台上最好的演員，在不同的戲裏，扮演不同的角色，也許很少—甚至是沒有扮演過他自已。</p>
<p>在人生的舞台上上：你也許是你父親的好兒子，妻子的好丈夫，孩子的好爸爸，同胞的好兄弟，佣人的好主人，同事的好上司，丈母娘的好女婿，……可曾想到：你是不是你自己的最好的自己？</p>
<p>假使葡萄不酸，檸樣也不甜，沒準兒世上的爭鬥還要多些。</p>

<p>— 高君賓</p>
<p>「山廬好，生意盎然長，雞撫羣雛爭護母，貓生一子宛如娘，物類亦慈祥。」</p>
<p>右望江南詞一闋，為家君（編者按：本文作者為高吹萬先生之公子。）年前所作，悵念家山，追懷舊夢，全稿共有六十四鬨，風花雪月，動植飛潛，山廬景物，描寫如畫。姚虞琴先生讀之，因以宛如名其家貓。豐子愷先生讀之，即取上闋詞意繪畫見貺。昨歲家君七秩，堅辭不許稱觴，僅借東坡誔辰，舉行消寒雅集，遂以此畫，製成詩箋，分贈親友，家君名其箋日「雞貓箋」，得者皆稱妙云。（豐先生畫見圖）</p>
<h3>獄中寫作</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>美國某州監獄畏會經發表渦關於獄中囚犯寫作的意見，他說：</p>
<p>「每個監獄裏的囚犯，幾乎都願意終身從事寫作，所以監獄學校允許因犯有寫作的自由，雖然眞正成功的很少，可是許多著名的作家曾在獄中究成過傑作，那已是無可否認的事了。」</p>
<p>翻間歷史，正有　　多實例可以證明：像歷史上最著名的花花公子，所謂鞋上奘寶石耳上飾珍珠的瓦爾特勞雷——會把新大衣鋪在地上讓英國伊麗莎伯女皇踏過的風流謟媚者，也曾在獄中寫作。他為了政治上的原因，　過十四年的鐵窗風味。——他在簡陋又穢又狹的獄室中，眼睜睜睨視着牆壁上儘是流不盡的泥水，他的手足終於因風濕太重面致僵硬，但他忍受着一切的苦痛，在獄中完成了許多很美麗的詩篇，到現在還被許多大學與專門學校選選為教材呢！（編者按：　雷後被斬首。）</p>
<p>銷行六百萬册之多的著作家——美國短篇小說聖手歐亭利，會經含寃被捕入獄，被判五年徒刑；雖然下獄是羞恥的事，但對於歐亭利，要是他不做囚犯，他怎能安心寫作，以致於他的大名永垂不朽呢！</p>
<p>約翰本揚曾因傳教遭忌，而被逮捕入獄，連坐了十二年的牢，起初他為了顧全獄外的妻利四個可憐孩子的生活，不得不十指忙碌地編製着花邊，以便換錢貼補家用。但後來他腦中的偉大思想靈感突然開始湧起，使他再也忍耐不住，不得不在又冷又濕又黑的土牢中進行寫作了。誰知他就此完成了一本驚人的鉅著，那就是「天路歷程」，現在世界各國皆有譯本，除了聖經以外，它是第一本世界上銷行最廣的書。</p>
<p>賽凡鐵斯的不朽作品吉訶德先生傳，也是在獄中寫成的。此外弗爾泰，王爾德，以及安金尼博斯諸人，皆在獄中有過著作；就是銷行已經二百萬部的希特勒自傳「我的奮鬥」，其中半部也是希特勒在獄中寫成的。</p>
<p>二百六十年前的李却羅維雷斯，也曾被捕進過英國的監獄，結果使在獄中寫出了一首不朽的名詩，連監獄也因之事名。這是一首寄給愛人的情詩，它的標題是「獄中寄給雅蒂碧」詩云：石牆豈能算是監獄？鐵柵未必就是樊籠；天眞無邪的人們，應該來此隱居片刻；只要我仍有愛的自由，誰也不能拘束我的靈魂！歌頌吧，僅有崇高的　天使，才配享受這樣的自由！</p>

<h3>Cheng, Li, and Sun Accept the Public Opinion of the Central Executive Committee; Election Turmoil Has Subsided; Wang Chonghui and Others Pay Respects to the President and Report</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] President Chiang is concerned about the Vice Presidential election. At 9:00 AM on the 26th, he summoned Bai Chongxi at his official residence. In addition to inquiring about the war situation in Shaanxi Province, he also gave instructions on the Vice Presidential election. At 12:30 PM, he summoned Chen Zai Lei, Zhang , Bai Chongxi, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Lisheng, and six others to inquire about the situation of persuading the three candidates to withdraw from the election. At 5:00 PM, the President visited Tangshan. At 9:00 PM, he summoned Li Zongren, one of the candidates, at his official residence for a long discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The representatives Wang Chonghui, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhiben, Chen Bulei, and Zhang Lisheng, dispatched by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, paid respects to President Chiang on the 26th at noon to report on the progress of discussions with the Vice Presidential candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke. Cheng, Li, and Sun have all accepted the public opinion of the Central Executive Committee. On the Vice Presidential election issue, they will listen to the decision of the National Assembly and no longer insist on giving up. President Chiang was very pleased to hear this, believing that the election could proceed smoothly and expressed hope that the National Assembly representatives of the party would also understand the consensus declared by him in the Central Executive Committee and complete the Vice Presidential election as soon as possible. According to President Chiang's instructions at the Central Executive Committee on the 25th: The Central Executive Committee still follows the resolution of the Provisional Plenary Session on April 6th. The party will not determine a candidate for the Vice President in this term. Party comrades can participate in the election according to law in the National Assembly. (2) When party comrades vote, they can follow their own will and choose the candidate they consider most suitable. (3) Party comrades participating in campaigning or elections can express their freedom of speech, but must not engage in mutual attacks on each other. In other words, they can actively promote the election of a certain candidate, but must not negatively criticize any candidate. They should respect each other and trust each other, so as to establish good norms for the constitutional election.</p>
<p>Sun, Li, and Cheng Talk; Willing to Listen to the National Assembly's Decision</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Sun Ke, at 8:00 PM on the 26th, hosted a banquet for National Assembly representatives at the Longmen Restaurant. He stood up and said: His previous expression of giving up the election was to take into account the unity within the party, but now, in order to respect the resolution of the Central Executive Committee and the persuasion of Hu Shi, Yu Bin, Chen Qitian, and the other five members of the presidium of the National Assembly, he has decided to listen to the decision of the National Assembly. If the Assembly does not allow him to give up the election, he will only respect the opinion of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Li Zongren, at 8:00 PM on the 26th, hosted more than 500 National Assembly representatives who were campaigning for him at Anle Ying. He gave a speech, explaining four points: (1) Giving up the election this time was an unavoidable move to take into account unity. (2) Now, in order to take into account the resolution and persuasion of the presidium of the National Assembly and the resolution of the Central Executive Committee, he has expressed his willingness to listen to the decision of the Assembly. Whether or not to run for election is his right, and the representatives' right to choose a candidate is the representatives' right. His participation in this election does not really hope for success, because only without success can he make suggestions to the head of state from a detached position. (3) Those who are running for election have all been friends who have gone through thick and thin together. He is really saddened by the unpleasantness caused by this election. (4) The party purge in the past was his suggestion, and he still deeply hates the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Cheng Qian issued a written statement on the evening of the 26th, saying: "My giving up the election is to make the Assembly proceed smoothly. As long as the Assembly can proceed smoothly, whether or not I participate in the election is not important." Cheng told reporters in the morning: "My statement of giving up the election has been sent to the presidium, and there is no need to withdraw it, but everything should respect the decision of the National Assembly."</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Issue a Joint Statement, Hoping to Adhere to the Principle of Freedom in the Vice Presidential Election</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties issued a joint statement on the disturbance of the Presidential election on the 26th as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the Vice Presidential election, two sessions have been held on the 23rd and 24th of this month. The voters and candidates are proceeding according to law, and the situation is generally good. However, on the 25th, just as the third vote was about to begin, the legal candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke suddenly announced that they would give up the election. If the three have no reason to give up, we cannot but think that their actions seem ill-considered. If it is because of environmental factors that they have to give up, then we cannot but feel great concern for the future of constitutional government.</p>
<p>In the past, the principles of constitutional drafting were discussed by various parties and social elites for a long time. In last year's constitutional National Assembly, we also participated in the effort. However, the legal quota for this National Assembly is 3,045, and our Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties account for less than one-ninth of the total. Maintaining the dignity of the constitution is our inescapable duty, but the maintenance of a free and harmonious atmosphere in the venue still depends on the efforts of the Kuomintang. Now that such a disturbance has occurred, we cannot but feel regret.</p>
<p>Now the Assembly has been forced to adjourn for two days due to this unfortunate incident. The situation is serious, and both domestic and foreign observers expect the Assembly to conclude successfully. The Vice President is produced according to law, and the facts are obvious, and no details can be allowed to occur. It is obvious that our Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties cannot but adhere to the original intention of maintaining the constitution and the purpose of uniting against foreign aggression, and internally, to alleviate the resentment of the Chinese people, and externally, to correct the perceptions of friendly countries. We will never condone any measures that damage the spirit of the constitution. As for the election process, we must strictly abide by the principle of freedom. We hereby inform our colleagues in the Assembly, and we hope that they will understand."</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai's Talk</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, commented on the Vice Presidential election issue on the 26th: "Since the Republic of China, there have been trends in every presidential election. This presidential election was successfully produced, but unexpectedly, in the final stage of the Vice Presidential election, the candidates announced that they would give up, causing a great uproar. This is due to insufficient understanding of the rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p>The so-called law is like the rules of a craftsman, which can be used to make things square and round. It cannot be mixed with emotions and intentions. It is necessary to have the spirit of "hanging the law on the gate of the country and not changing a word." If you rely on your own preferences and arbitrarily make judgments, it is not enough to talk about the rule of law. The essence of democratic politics is to admit fair competition. All issues must be discussed openly, and the reasons must be convincing to the public, so the problems will be easily solved. The value of British and American politics lies in the solemn spirit of abiding by the law without any omissions throughout the country. This solemn spirit of abiding by the law is the foundation of the country and is worth emulating.</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of the Vice President, our party originally hoped that the Kuomintang would nominate one person to be elected. The previous meeting clearly declared that the Kuomintang would use the method of free election. Since a free election has been decided, the free will of the representatives to vote should be respected in order to establish a model of democratic politics. Our party hopes very much that no bad consequences will be caused by the Vice Presidential election, and that it will not fail the earnest expectations of the people of the country.</p>
<p>In democratic countries, divergent opinions before elections are common. Once the election is determined, all the past things will be forgotten. At the beginning of our country's constitutional government, we deeply hope to cultivate a democratic demeanor and that the Vice Presidential issue, which is still pending, can be resolved satisfactorily in accordance with the spirit of free election in the constitution, so as not to be laughed at by people at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau Employees Donate a Presidential Special Train</h3>
<p>Construction Begins Immediately, Completion Expected at the End of the Month</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th dispatch] President Chiang was elected as the first president, and the whole country cheered. All employees of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau specially donated money to build a special train for the first president, which is currently being built in Puzhen Airport and is expected to be completed by the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi's Talk</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The National Assembly elected the Vice President, and because the candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke successively gave up the election, the meeting was adjourned and the election was suspended for several days, which attracted attention at home and abroad. Zeng Qi, chairman of the China Youth Party, recently made a speech saying: In this election, I have always advocated adopting both the "Western democratic spirit" and the "Eastern spirit of concession." Therefore, I am unwilling to run for both president and vice president. It is true that the Kuomintang has been in power for 20 years, has many talents, and has a superior position. The minority party should let them be elected so that they can shoulder more and heavier responsibilities. Now that the president has been elected, the Vice Presidential election has suddenly taken a turn for the worse. This is really unfortunate for the Assembly and a crisis for the constitutional government. I am really worried. I hope that the candidates can all have the demeanor of statesmen, follow public opinion, not retreat due to setbacks, and not be discouraged by failure. I once said that politicians should have three styles: one is demeanor, advance and retreat, open and aboveboard, honor and disgrace, and be calm. This is demeanor. The second is integrity, wealth cannot be licentious, poverty cannot be moved, and power cannot be subdued. This is integrity. The third is friendship, promoting the good of others, helping others achieve their beauty, being urgent for others' needs, and worrying about others' worries. This is friendship. If these three styles can be shown to the whole country, then whether the election is successful or not, it will be respected by the people of the country. For example, the demeanor of Yu Ranweng in Sanyuan in recent days can be used as an example. Zhang Jiangji once said: "If gains and losses, slander and praise, success and failure cannot be broken through, then there is nothing that can be done in the world." Zhuge Wuhou said himself: "My heart is like a scale, and I cannot make light or heavy for others." I believe that those in power must have this magnanimity. Now is the time to suppress chaos and build the country. We should be in awe of the meaning of "success in war lies in harmony" and not let our loved ones feel pain and our enemies feel happy, so as to avoid the Communist Party from laughing secretly beside us. We must know that disputes should be avoided and harmony can unite. The three gentlemen, Sun, Li, and Cheng, who are running for election, all belong to the same party. Presumably, there is no reason why they cannot be harmonious. I very much hope that they can show the people of the country the ethics of Westerners playing ball and the model of constitutional government, so that the Assembly will still close smoothly.</p>
<h3>Li Zongren's Campaign Committee Sends a Letter Inquiring to the Transportation Service Agency</h3>
<p>Questioning the Source of the Advertisement on the 23rd</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The advertisement published by the Nanjing Transportation Service Agency in the Xinmin Daily on the 23rd, which caused a turn in the Vice Presidential election (the main idea was reported yesterday), has raised the issue of investigating responsibility. Li Zongren's Vice Presidential campaign committee sent a letter to the agency on the afternoon of the 26th to investigate the matter. The letter said: "Our office has checked the advertisement of your agency published in the Xinmin Daily on the 23rd of this month, which has been criticized by the extra edition of the Central Daily News on the 25th, which not only considers it childish and ridiculous, but also considers that it has caused rumors among the representatives of the National Assembly and the general public. This is related to the reputation of Director Li's campaign committee. Who instructed this kind of advertisement, or is it your agency's autonomous behavior in order to solicit business through advertisements? We hope that you will reply clearly in writing within half a day of receiving the letter, and hope that you will still publish the truth in the Xinmin Daily on the 27th. If you delay the reply, our committee will immediately file a lawsuit according to law." Zhu Guangzheng, general manager of the Transportation Service Agency, replied: "I have received your letter and learned that the advertisement of our agency has had an impact on your reputation, and I express my deep regret. I hereby reply." Zhu hosted reporters at 8:00 PM on the 26th for this matter, explaining that after reading the extra edition of the Central Daily News on the 26th, he drafted an advertisement that evening and sent it to the Xinmin, Dagang, and Heping newspapers, but it was not published. Zhu also made a defense against the criticism of the Central Daily News, and said that he is a member of the Kuomintang, and his advertisement and free supply of cars for representatives who elected Li were done as a civilian. Zhu also insisted that he had never met Li.</p>
<h3>Date of the First Legislative Yuan Meeting to be Decided After the List of Names is Announced; The Meeting Preparatory Office Announced its Abolition Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The "Preparatory Office for the First Legislative Yuan Meeting under the Constitution," which was attached to the current Legislative Yuan Secretariat and presided over by the current Secretary-General Lou Tongsun, was abolished on the 26th. According to the regulations on the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution, the first Legislative Yuan will hold a meeting on its own on the seventh day after the closing of the National Assembly. The establishment of the preparatory office and the registration of the Legislative Yuan members are not necessary and have no legal basis. The registration encountered difficulties from the beginning. Some Legislative Yuan members without election certificates rushed to register, making the preparatory office unable to cope. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, more than 20 Legislative Yuan members who claimed to be nominated by the Kuomintang went to the Legislative Yuan to register. Because the preparatory office had been abolished and registration was stopped, they could not register. It is reported that the list of elected Legislative Yuan members will not be announced until a few days later. The date and method of the meeting will be decided after the list is announced.</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Will Continue to Adjourn Today; The Decision on the Vice Presidential Election Issue Will Be Discussed and Decided at the General Assembly Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The National Assembly Presidium held its 37th meeting at 4:00 PM on the 26th. Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Hu Shi, Yu Bin, and others reported on the presidium's persuasion of Li, Sun, and Cheng to withdraw from the Vice Presidential election this morning. It is said that the three have all expressed their willingness to listen to the decision of the Assembly. The meeting discussed the continuation of the election for a long time and decided to adjourn for another day on the 27th. The general assembly will be held again at 9:00 AM on the 28th, and the presidium will report on the issue of Li, Sun, and Cheng giving up the Vice Presidential election and ask the Assembly to make a decision. The presidium also decided to hold the 38th meeting at 4:00 PM on the 27th to discuss the agenda of the 28th general assembly.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] The deadlock in the Vice Presidential election, after the persuasion of Hu Yishi, Yu Bin, Zeng Baosun, Chen Qitian, Sun Yafu and other representatives of the National Assembly Presidium and the efforts of Wang Chonghui, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Yiqun, Chen Bulei, Zhang Zhiben, Zhang Lisheng and other representatives of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang on the evening of the 25th, was completely opened on the evening of the 26th. In the morning of the 26th, Hu Gan and others visited Li Yizongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian, representing the presidium to persuade them to continue to run for Vice President. They first arrived at Li's residence at 9:30 AM and talked for half an hour. At 10:00 AM, they visited Sun Ke, and at 10:30 AM, they visited Cheng Qian. The persuasion was completed at 11:00 AM. Hu Shi told reporters after persuading Li, Sun, and Cheng: "The attitudes of the three gentlemen are very good, and they have all expressed their willingness to listen to the decision of the Assembly. If the Assembly does not accept the statements of the three gentlemen to give up the election, then the three gentlemen will continue to run for election."</p>
<h3>The President Summons Li Zongren and Decides to Stop Flying to Peiping and Still Participate in the Election</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Li Zongren's intention to give up the Vice Presidential election was very firm, and he was scheduled to leave Beijing for Peiping on the morning of the 27th to show his determination. At 9:30 PM on the 26th, President Chiang summoned Li and gave him a lot of encouragement. He reiterated the party's position to Li and decided to implement a free election for the Vice President. He hoped that Li would withdraw his original intention to give up. Li was deeply moved when he heard this and decided to accept the President's intention to stop flying to Peiping and still run for election as before.</p>
<h3>He Qian Makes Three Suggestions</h3>
<p>The National Assembly Presidium Conducts Research and Discussion</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th dispatch] Cheng Qian made three important suggestions to the National Assembly Presidium on the 26th: (1) All proposals of the Assembly are the result of careful consideration by the representatives and are also valuable contributions to the government. How to make them effective should be studied. (3) Some representatives from the Northeast and North China should be given the opportunity to participate in the work of suppressing the rebellion and to relieve the refugees in the Northeast and North China.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>We Can No Longer Disappoint the People!</h3>
<p>The whole country is watching the Vice Presidential election. Both ballots failed to produce a winner with over half of the votes, so there was no Vice President. When the National Assembly was about to hold the third ballot, the three candidates suddenly declared that they would withdraw from the election, which almost caused a political uproar. Not only did it make the third ballot impossible, but it also forced the National Assembly to use adjournment to quell this shocking situation. After two days of running around and mediation by various parties, the anger in the capital was finally diluted. The three candidates have all expressed their willingness to follow the decision of the General Assembly. If the General Assembly does not accept the declaration of withdrawal from the election, they will continue to run. Although this storm is gradually subsiding, whether the anger in the capital can be completely transformed into peace and harmony, and whether the National Assembly can hold the third ballot according to law tomorrow (the 28th), is a major key. Therefore, we have to appeal to the members of the National Assembly and ask you to attend the National Assembly to vote tomorrow. You must act according to your personal conscience and not forget the ancient teaching of "one thought for the country, one thought against the country." Representatives, you must not disappoint the people again!</p>
<p>First, although the people of the country regard the National Assembly's election of the Vice President as the most exciting finale of the National Assembly, and watch the first and second ballots with all eyes, they do not particularly value the Vice President. Therefore, when the competition among the candidates reached a fever pitch, although the capital was filled with tension, other parts of the country maintained an optimistic attitude. Moreover, everyone believes that, whether in accordance with the provisions of our country's constitution, or looking at the precedents of advanced democratic countries, the Vice President's position in the country is not very important. Among the six candidates, no matter which one is elected, they can be competent and more than capable, and there is no difference. Therefore, no matter what high-sounding views the Vice Presidential candidates expressed, they did not attract the attention of our ordinary people. It is only because the country can embark on the normal operation of democratic constitutionalism from now on, so they hope that this National Assembly will complete its legal procedures as soon as possible, that's all.</p>
<p>Second, everyone does not deny that democratic politics in our country is still in the stage of learning. The chaos in the National Assembly's meeting this time was indeed expected. However, the representatives' use of "booing" to resist the speeches of opponents, and even resorting to physical violence at the slightest disagreement, this kind of arbitrary and unreasonable behavior has exceeded the limits we expected. Since the opening of the National Assembly, almost every day there has been a quarrel in the venue. We can find almost daily in the news about the venue happenings that can be used as jokes. If this kind of disorderly National Assembly continues, it will not only waste money and manpower, but also be futile. Moreover, it is all harmful and not beneficial to the future of the democratic party politics. The so-called everything is cautious in the beginning. When taking a big step towards democratic constitutionalism, if a good model cannot be established, then our country's democratic constitutionalism will have no future. Therefore, we hope that the members of the National Assembly can reflect on themselves, and that attendance at the National Assembly must respect the law and abide by order, so that the National Assembly can proceed smoothly and complete its basic tasks as soon as possible. On the morning of the 25th, some representatives, because they were stimulated by the candidates' withdrawal from the election, arbitrarily shouted in the venue, which turned the National Assembly into a noisy place. This kind of behavior that undermines the progress of the Assembly's discussions, even if it can be forgiven by the presidium, is always unforgivable in the eyes of our ordinary people. Tomorrow's National Assembly will hold the third vote, which can be said to have reached the final moment. If there are any representatives who make trouble for no reason, arbitrarily shout, and undermine the progress of the third vote, they will be abandoned by the people of the country. The voters can dismiss them according to law, and even in the opinion circles, they should do their best to condemn them.</p>
<p>Third, according to the evening newspapers, two campaign teams have established two permanent organizations, one called the "Democratic Constitutional Movement Committee" and the other named the "Constitutional Promotion Association." According to our own declared purpose, it is to supervise the government's implementation of constitutionalism. We do not ask what the motives of these National Assembly representatives are in initiating the organization? However, we cannot but point out that since the opening of the National Assembly, these National Assembly representatives' actions to establish laws and protect the constitution have been seen everywhere. Now, instead of seeking oneself, they are harshly criticizing others and establishing other iron rules. Even if there is no political conspiracy or other effects, the result will inevitably create a split within the National Assembly, only making relatives sad and enemies happy. Therefore, we have to sincerely tell the representatives that this kind of behavior that splits the National Assembly is definitely not the wish of our ordinary people. If you are unwilling to consider the support or opposition of public opinion and insist on your own way, it will inevitably arouse the anger of the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Fourth, the accidental storm in this Vice Presidential election was caused by rumors inside and outside the meeting, which caused misunderstandings among the candidates. However, the Vice Presidential candidates are all veterans of the party and the country, and leaders of the people, so they will not resort to unscrupulous means to attack each other. We believe that these leaflets that slander the other party must have been done by their campaign teams, there is no doubt. We are unwilling to harshly criticize the excessive enthusiasm of these campaign workers, but we cannot but hope that the candidates can use the magnanimous demeanor of politicians to clarify the source of the rumors and make them disappear. The three gentlemen, Li, Sun, and Cheng, are willing to listen to advice, accept the advice of the presidium of the National Assembly, and express their willingness to listen to the decision of the General Assembly, still showing the demeanor of statesmen. We hope that Li will express his opinion clearly as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also point out that the current situation is more serious than any period in history. The Communist Party's conspiracy to destroy China is to destroy the Kuomintang first. When we see through the inner layer of the Kuomintang, it is undeniable that it is on the verge of disintegration. The occurrence of this Vice Presidential election storm is an exposure of the Kuomintang's internal weaknesses, which cannot but cause us infinite worries. Even if the members of the National Assembly are unwilling to be members of the Kuomintang, they are also unwilling to be slaves of a subjugated country. Therefore, we must ask the members of the National Assembly to raise their vigilance, strengthen unity, and strive to promote democratic constitutionalism and complete the suppression of the rebellion and national construction. Only when everyone stands together and unites sincerely can democratic constitutionalism embark on the right track. Representatives, you must not disappoint the people again.</p>

<h3>Two Million Acres of Fertile Land Discovered in the Yellow Flood Area of Northern Anhui; Formed by Drained Flood Deposits; Excellent Results in Trial Cultivation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Bengbu on the 24th] The Yellow Flood Area includes the areas flooded by the Hong wash in the three provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui. The disaster situation is extremely serious. Unexpectedly, after the water drained, many alluvial fertile lands have been discovered recently. According to the investigation by the staff in the Yellow Flood Area, the yellow water stagnating in Henan Province is mostly coarse sand that erodes farmland. Except for Shouxian and Fengtai counties, which have been slightly damaged by coarse sand, most of the silt deposited in Anhui Province is a kind of fine sand. The former inferior fields have now been transformed into fertile ones. For example, the Chengxi Lake between the Huai River and Fengshou, the Jingshan Lake in Huaiyuan, the Gaojia Lake and Longtan Lake in Wuhe, and the Shuanggou area in Sixian have all been discovered. It is estimated that as of now, more than two million acres of fertile land have been discovered in the Yellow Flood Area of Northern Anhui. This newly silted arable land has been used by the Anhui Reclamation Team for trial cultivation with tractors. The results are very good. The soil is fertile and the crops are unusually lush and the grains are very strong. The yield is twice as high as that of ordinary farmland. The leader is Father Hayden</p>

<h3>The "Living Immortal" From Shizhu to Chongqing; Teenage Girl Yang Mei; Has Not Eaten for Nine Years</h3>
<p>This is a strange event that has stirred the mountain city, and it is also a physiological phenomenon worthy of study. The reporter, Mr. Zhen, only reported a piece of evidence that someone does not eat, but did not fabricate any deceptive lies. The questions raised in it must be studied by physiologists, physicians, or scientists. (Editor)</p>
<p>[Chongqing dispatch from our newspaper on the 22nd] When the price of grain is rising sharply, and many people are struggling on the verge of starvation, feeling the threat of life, suddenly, a teenage girl from Shizhu who has not eaten for nine years comes to Chongqing. How amazing is this news? Driven by curiosity, the reporter went to the National Women's Normal College in Jiulongpo to visit. It is said that "this Shizhu girl lost her parents early in her childhood and was raised in her uncle's house. Because her uncle's family was poor, she could not receive school education. So far, she does not have a name. People call her 'Yang Mei.'"</p>
<p>A Strange Disease According to legend, nine years ago, Yang Mei and a group of rural children went to the hillside to dig "Cigu" (arrowhead) to eat. She dug up a very large one and ate it, then suffered from abdominal pain and diarrhea, and was bedridden. After taking medicine and recovering, she has never eaten food, and it has been nine years now! If she is forced to eat, she will vomit immediately. Therefore, she does not excrete feces, and even urination is rare. Although she does not eat or drink, her health has not been affected at all. Her body is not thin, and the muscles of her hands and feet are very developed, and her face is ruddy.</p>
<p>After Coming to Chongqing Recently, a senator accompanied Yang Mei to Chongqing, wanting to find the medical community to examine the reason why she does not eat food. He left her at the home of Zhuo Songdai, the director of general affairs at the Women's Normal College. Zhuo and She are relatives, so they take good care of her. Director Zhuo Songdai once wrote twenty words to teach her, and she learned them soon, without fail. This proves that her intelligence is not low. But when asked how old she is this year, she does not know. Judging from her appearance, she is about twenty years old.</p>
<p>Inspection Report Zhuo's mother-in-law, Mrs. Zhang, said: Yang Mei has never had her period. She occasionally drinks tea, but urinates immediately. She has drunk raw water, but has never gotten sick. Her teeth are naturally white and not brushed. She is indeed a piece of evidence that does not eat, and this is not a deceptive lie.</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Qinshu, director of the health team at the Women's Normal College, said after the examination: Yang Mei was naked and allowed me to examine her. There was nothing different from ordinary people. The pulse and heartbeat were normal, and the lungs also met health standards. Although the breasts were not very developed, they were not abnormal. Only the abdomen was not large. When the stethoscope was pressed on the abdomen, there was only the sound of water being squeezed, probably because there was no food in the stomach.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Marry Her Yang Mei has not eaten anything for nine years, which should be an enviable gospel to those who are struggling on the verge of starvation. However, her fiancé broke off the engagement with her for this sole reason. Later, her uncle re-arranged a marriage for her, but the result was still the same. This fiancé, as usual, was unwilling to marry a woman who did not eat. So she had to live alone. People happily talk about the living immortal on Jiulongpo, but she herself has not found or enjoyed the happiness of life. (Wei Xuezhen)</p>

<h3>Disturbances and Demonstrations in Korean Bridge in Osaka and Kobe; US Military Declares Emergency Martial Law; Japanese Ministry of Education Says It Will Not Withdraw the Order to Close Korean Schools; More Than 900 Koreans and Japanese People Reported</h3>
<p>[United Press, Kobe, 26th] The US military headquarters ordered a full-scale round-up of the Japanese Communist Party and Koreans who rioted last weekend on the 26th. This is the first official order after the declaration of temporary martial law. Chinese military police are now patrolling the Kobe area to prevent the outbreak of new incidents. Japanese police are commanded by Minoch, commander of the US military police at Kobe base, during the temporary emergency martial law period.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] According to Japanese sources, General Acheson has ordered that all Koreans found near the Kobe Prefectural Government, regardless of their purpose or occupation, be arrested. According to Osaka Police Chief Suzuki, Japanese police have been ordered to shoot and kill any Korean rioters who threaten public order.</p>
<p>[United Press, Osaka, 26th] Ten thousand Koreans in the area were officially allowed to march and demonstrate on the 26th, kidnapping two Japanese police officers, who were safely released two hours later. At the same time, all indications are that the Communist Party is inciting the disturbance in order to embarrass the United States in the South Korean election on May 10th. The demonstrating Koreans gathered in front of the Osaka City Hall, while the Korean leaders went inside to discuss the dispute caused by the Korean schools. The Tokyo National Police Agency of Japan stated that it had learned that the Communist Party had been ordered to instigate Korean demonstrations throughout Japan, and to hold a huge march in Tokyo on May 10th. It also stated that on May Day, demonstrations will be held in major cities in Japan, with Koreans participating in a prominent position. A march will also be held in Yamaguchi Prefecture, western Honshu, on May 6th. Newspapers claimed that the Korean demonstration was part of the Communist Party's agenda to harass the United States and persuade Koreans to boycott the election. The Eighth Army reported that seven of the arrested ringleaders in the Kobe riot were members of the Japanese Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Reinforcements for the Korean masses arrived this morning from the Kyoto, Nara, and Kobe areas to Osaka. There were more than 1,500 Koreans in the area, armed with wooden sticks and chili powder, gathered in front of the prefectural government. At 11:00 am this morning, there were about 1,300 Koreans on the highway from Kyoto to Osaka. About 1,000 Koreans came from the Nara area, and about 800 came from Hyogo via Kobe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] General Acheson, Commander of the US Eighth Army, flew to Kobe this morning to inspect the disturbance in person.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese Vice Minister of Education Arimitsu Jiro stated this morning that there have been serious Korean riots in Osaka and Kobe in the past few days, but the Japanese government will not withdraw its order to close Korean schools in Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Kobe, 26th] Lieutenant General Acheson, commander of the US Eighth Army in Japan, bluntly attacked the Japanese Communist Party at a press conference here on the 26th as "obviously the instigator of several riots over the weekend in the Kobe-Osaka area." Acheson also said that 30 Koreans had been arrested for participating in the march and imprisoning the mayor, and eight Japanese people arrested on the same charges had been proven to be members of the Japanese Communist Party, one of whom was a Kobe city councilor.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Japanese Communist Party, which was condemned for supporting Korean riots in Japan, issued a formal statement today supporting the actions of the Koreans.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Kobe, 26th] The situation in Kobe has calmed down. Military police vehicles with four soldiers each are patrolling, armed. Osaka is still large</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur's headquarters issued a special statement by Lieutenant General Acheson, commander of the US Eighth Army, on the clashes between Korean residents and Japanese police in Osaka and Kobe, stating: "On April 24, about 1,000 Koreans surrounded the prefectural government, deliberately cut power lines, destroyed equipment, and imprisoned the prefectural governor, police chief, mayor, etc. The US military's decision on how to resolve this incident is: (1) All Koreans detained in the past will be released; (2) All Korean schools recently closed will be reopened; (3) Koreans participating in illegal incidents should be prosecuted immediately in accordance with the law; (4) Punish the participants in this incident." According to the US military, "as of the 26th, the number of Koreans and Japanese Communist Party members who have been reported in this incident has reached as many as 943."</p>
<h3>The Main Reason for the Korean Riots in Osaka and Kobe is Dissatisfaction with the Japanese Empire; Korean Residents Association Talks to US Reporters</h3>
<p>[United Press, Kobe, 26th] The Korean Residents Association propaganda team told United Press reporters today that the riots in Osaka and Kobe were not incited by the Communist Party, but an outbreak of public dissatisfaction with Japanese imperialism. The association has 600,000 members, and the total number of Koreans in Japan is about 610,000. Another 10,000 Koreans are in contact with the association and youth associations to promote Korean independence. Although some of the association and other groups are communists, they are not political groups.</p>
<p>The uprising was not incited by a small number of people, as the military government in Tokyo claimed. The military government had ordered Korean residents to abide by the Japanese education system in Korean schools. The education of Korean residents is of great concern to everyone, even to people in Korea itself. These people are extremely angry at the Japanese interference in their education. The Koreans are negotiating with the Tokyo education authorities on the issue of local schools, but have not yet received a satisfactory response. I hope there will be no disturbances here, but it depends on the attitude of the Japanese. The Tokyo Education Bureau had ordered Korean residents to abide by the Japanese education system, otherwise the schools would be closed. Unrest in various parts of Korea on the eve of the election</p>
<h3>The Korean Communist Party Instigated the Sniping of an American Plane Taking Off from Jeju Island</h3>

<h3>Finnish Newspaper Accuses Communist Party of Attempting to Overthrow Government</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Union Suddenly Participates in the Trusteeship Council; Appoints the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in the United States as Representative; It is Believed that the Soviet Union Will Participate in the Discussion of the Holy Land Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 25th] The Soviet Union notified the United Nations Secretariat today by letter that it had appointed Tsalapkin, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy, as its representative to the Trusteeship Council. The Soviet Union refused to participate in the Trusteeship Council from its inception two years ago, believing that the organization was improperly organized. This sudden change of heart is probably intended to ensure full speaking rights in the discussion of the Palestine issue. Tsalapkin participated in the drafting of the UN Special Committee on Palestine, which strongly advocated partition, last autumn.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 25th, United Press] According to authoritative sources, the Soviet Union's participation in the Trusteeship Council was prompted by recent negotiations on Palestine. If the United Nations passes the U.S. proposal to place Palestine under the Trusteeship Council, the Soviet representative on the Trusteeship Council can express opinions, participate in debates, and participate in some important future consultations. The other eleven countries participating in the Trusteeship Council include the United States, Britain, China, and other countries. Even if the U.S. trusteeship plan is adopted, the Soviet Union's participation in the Trusteeship Council cannot prevent the control of Palestine by the two powers, because the veto power of the great powers cannot be applied to the Trusteeship Council.</p>

<h3>Early Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Fuel Oil; Pre-Allocation of Coal for One Month; Whether to Abolish the Adjusted Price Formula Awaits Discussion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of indirect subsidies for public utilities in this city, the Municipal Government has been in contact with the Central Bank for several days regarding the early settlement of foreign exchange for fuel oil and gasoline needed by public utilities for one month. After continuous negotiations, an agreement has been reached. The total is approximately 250 billion national currency, of which the Shanghai Electric Power Company accounts for 200 billion. The company will find the funds on its own. Other public utility companies account for 50 billion. With the special approval of Mayor Wu, the funds needed will be temporarily allocated from the fines for saving electricity, calculated according to bank interest rates.</p>
<p>[Another report] Regarding the issue of indirect subsidies for public utilities, after consultations between the Municipal Government and the Fuel Management Committee of the Central Bank, a principle agreement has been reached on the two items of early settlement of foreign exchange and advance purchase of coal. Efforts will be made to advance the settlement of foreign exchange for fuel oil and gasoline purchased by public utility companies by one month, that is, to settle the foreign exchange for May in April. The coal needed will also be pre-allocated with one month's coal volume, approximately 50,000 tons. However, the Fuel Management Committee currently has too little coal reserves, so it is now necessary to rush coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai for supply. According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, it is hoped that various indirect subsidies can be realized this month, so that the price of public utilities can be stabilized. However, the cost of living index and the hardware index are quite problematic. The cost of telephone is mainly based on the cost of living index and the hardware index. The cost of trams and buses is also mainly based on the cost of living index. It is currently impossible to reduce it. If various elements (foreign exchange, fuel, hardware index, cost of living index, etc.) in the costs of the eight major public utilities can be calculated according to the previous month, then their prices will no longer be adjusted. Whether the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities will be temporarily suspended in May is currently awaiting instructions from the Executive Yuan. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will convene a meeting within the next few days to discuss it. If necessary, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, will go to the capital to report.</p>
<h3>The Fuel Management Committee Notifies Shipping Industry to Transport Coal from Qinhuangdao</h3>

After the implementation of this measure, all coal in Qinhuangdao is expected to be transported to Shanghai within one month, and the city's coal reserves should be even thicker.</p>

It is now learned that the Lis and others returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday, quite satisfied with the results of their petition, and told reporters that after presenting the matter to Minister Yu of the Food Department, Minister Yu stated that the decision to collect 100,000 bags of tax grain from Fujian could not be cancelled, because the military needed grain urgently during this period of national suppression of the rebellion, and all provinces had to pay, so Fujian could not be treated differently. However, in order to remedy the shortage of food in Fujian itself and to avoid a sharp rise in food prices, it was decided to allow the province to pay the 100,000 bags of tax grain in two installments: 50,000 bags would be paid now, and another 50,000 bags would be paid in the second half of the year. At the same time, the Four Banks Joint Treasury was requested to approve a loan of 160 billion yuan, and to designate the purchase of grain (approximately 50,000 bags) in Anhui, Jiangxi, and Taiwan provinces to offset the amount due at present. As for the 50,000 bags due in the second half of the year, Li said that other methods would be sought, and if the spring harvest this year was good, it could be paid as ordered.</p>

<h3>District Procuratorate Interrogates Wen Guangting's Lawsuit Yesterday; Court Police Suspected of Soliciting Bribes During Bail; Prosecutor Expresses Doubt; Police Precinct Dissatisfied with Wen's Declaration of Innocence</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wen Guangting, a worker at the Hufan Sand Casting Factory who was recently released on bail from the Sinan Road Detention Center, previously sent a letter to the Senate accusing police officers of illegally extorting confessions and court police of soliciting bribes. The District Procuratorate interrogated the case yesterday, with Prosecutor Liang Qingshun summoning Wen Guangting, Tian Abing, Tian Liangquan, and Xu Jingkuan for questioning, and all were ordered to return. When Wen arrived in court yesterday, he was wearing a blue cloth worker's jacket, gray cloth trousers, and rubber-soled sneakers. Wen is from Hunan and is about twenty years old. Yesterday, the prosecutor's interrogation was limited to the part about whether the court police had solicited bribes. The accusations against Wen of robbery and theft, and whether the police bureau had used torture, were not involved yesterday because they were within the scope of the trial. According to Wen, the court policeman Xu Jingkuan asked him for a bribe of 5 million yuan when he asked Hufan Sand Casting Factory to provide bail, because the old landlord Tian Abing was not in the factory, and no one in the factory was responsible for stamping the bail form. The demand was made by Xu to Wen on the way back to the district court. The prosecutor expressed doubt about this testimony, because without bail, there would inevitably be ____ detention, and there was no reason to ask Wen for a bribe after the bail was unsuccessful. He then asked whether he had given money to the court policeman. He replied, "No." He also said, "I didn't have a penny in my pocket. The 80,000 yuan for the round-trip fare when I was released on bail was borrowed from the Hufan Sand Casting Factory." Tian Abing was subsequently summoned for questioning. Tian said that on the day Wen came to seek bail, he happened to be out on business and did not return until late at night. Because he was not at home, no one else dared to take responsibility, but he said that he was willing to vouch for Wen. Tian Liangquan said that he had sent the bail form to the district court, but he did not know the other details.</p>
<p>Xu Jingkuan Denies Solicitation, Says He Even Paid for the Petition</p>
<p>Finally, court policeman Xu Jingkuan was summoned. Xu is the youngest of the court police and had studied at Xiaoguang Middle School. He was very upset about the accusation, saying that he not only did not solicit a penny from Wen, but even paid for a copy of the petition. Because the bail was not found, he was still escorted back and handed over to the judge. He fulfilled his responsibilities ____, as for how the judge handled it, he did not know, and now he has been falsely accused in this way, and he is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the later submission of Wen Guangting's supplementary bail form was put aside, and the delivery of the judgment to the defendant was ____, causing Wen Guangting to be detained for several more days. There is also suspicion that the court side was slow in handling the matter.</p>
<p>Rumored to be Manipulated by a Lawyer</p>
<p>Wen was detained even though he was innocent, and he held a grudge in his heart. It happened that a "lawyer" named Hu was also detained because of a case, and was also tried by Judge Cao Zuwei. Wen talked about the circumstances of the case, and Hu then wrote a secret letter to the Senate on Wen's behalf to accuse him. On the one hand, he vented his anger for Wen, and on the other hand, he also attacked Judge Cao. Also, because the details were flat, he fabricated the news that the court police solicited a bribe of 5 million yuan on behalf of the judge in order to sensationalize ____. The Xinshijie Police Precinct expressed dissatisfaction with the court's declaration of Wen's innocence in the robbery case, and yesterday submitted a statement to the court requesting a retrial.</p>

<h3>The Establishment of the Rediscount Committee Today: Banks and the Joint Treasury Being the Direct Targets</h3>

President Zhang will personally preside. Committee members Xu Baiyuan and Zhao Dixian have already arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing to attend.</p>
<p>[Report from the Joint Credit Information Office] Preparations for the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee are complete. The three national committees for industry, mining, trade, and agriculture have also been established one after another. The rediscount rules for each committee have been discussed and drafted. The Rediscount Committee has entered the practical implementation stage. According to the person in charge of the committee, speaking to a reporter from the Joint Credit Information Office, the Central Bank's rediscount work will not involve ordinary commercial institutions. Its direct targets are banks and the Joint Treasury. Those seeking national policy loans can apply to the Joint Treasury. After approval by the Joint Treasury, the National Bank Consortium will handle the loan. The Central Bank will then rediscount and re-mortgage. General manufacturers needing short-term capital should apply for loans from banks. When lending banks lack working capital, they can apply to the Central Bank for rediscounting. After the Rediscount Committee verifies the application, it can proceed with rediscounting or re-mortgaging. In this way, the Central Bank can fulfill its role as "the bank of banks." As for the rediscount rate, the Rediscount Committee will determine it based on the actual situation.</p>

Subsequently, due to increased selling, the price fell rapidly to 4.97 million.

<p>Spot Cotton Firm Yesterday, the spot cotton market remained firm due to the lifting of the ban on shipping yarn and cloth to the south, and the closing prices of cotton yarn were high, boosting morale among traders. In particular, credit conditions among traders eased, and the supply of goods on the market was very limited, leading to aggressive bidding. However, as the official opening purchase prices had not yet increased, sellers were reluctant to sell, and transactions were minimal.

<h3>Reduction in Gasoline Allocation to be Replaced by Alcohol</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the allocation of gasoline in this city has been decreasing daily.

<h3>Pig Bristle Export Situation Improves This Year</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the export situation of pig bristles in our country has gradually improved. According to statistics, the export volume in the past three months has increased significantly compared to the second half of last year. It is understood that the main reason is that nylon, invented by the United States during the war, is not sufficient to replace pig bristles. Therefore, general brush factories are gradually switching back to using pig bristles after the war. The main export destination for pig bristles in our country is still the United States, followed by the Soviet Union due to debt repayment relations. Exports to Europe are very limited due to the lack of US dollars.</p>

<p>Taiwan Sugar Shipped to Shanghai [Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu ship returned to Shanghai from Taiwan the day before yesterday (Sunday), bringing 8,709 tons of sugar, totaling 99,576 bags, which are being unloaded at buoys No. 2 and No. 3.</p>
<p>The Haichen ship returned to Shanghai from Saipan Island yesterday, bringing supplies from the Materials Supply Bureau, over eleven box containers of food, which are being unloaded at the Qiujiang Wharf.</p>
<p>The Cai E ship loaded more than 5,000 pieces of cotton and more than 24,000 bags of flour yesterday to be transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabric Firm Prices for standard woolen fabrics have been rising daily. Light-colored thin woolens and worsteds, which are in season, are particularly sought after, with strong demand from local and Nanjing merchants. However, there are concerns about the high prices of women's woolen fabrics. The rate of price increase for these fabrics is higher than that of other woolens. Yesterday, the asking price for first-grade women's woolen fabric was around 4 million yuan, second-grade was 3.2 to 3.3 million yuan, third-grade was 2.4 to 2.5 million yuan, and fourth-grade was 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Fabrics All Rise</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market was bullish yesterday as factory silk rapidly rose, boosting morale. 120-count Asahi brand glossy silk traded in the morning from 237 million yuan to 240 million yuan for spot price, with immediate closing. Next-day delivery for the afternoon will be 242 million yuan. Stable in the afternoon, closing price of 243 million.</p>
<p>The factory silk market rose again yesterday. C-grade traded for 405 million yuan, with two transactions. Another lot was sold for 390 million yuan, and Double Tiger for 95 million yuan, a increase of 20 million yuan compared to last Saturday. Due to restrictions on cocoon loans requiring a 20% self-funded deposit and only allowing factory silk to be mortgaged for 10%, spot goods are bound to be scarce, leading to a bullish outlook. Transactional sales were very scarce, and the market sentiment was stable.</p>
<p>The silk goods market rose first and then fell slightly yesterday. Silk quilt covers finally rose by 8 million yuan over last Saturday. Huaxin goods opened high at 160 million yuan, then retreated to around 159 million yuan, and finally fell to 156.8 million yuan at the close. Dachang check crepe closed at 560,000 yuan. Other goods also increased by 5% to 10%.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Opens High, Then Closes Flat</h3>
<p>The rice market followed the rise in tin prices and tried to increase, with owners asking for higher prices. The morning market rose by 100,000 yuan, but this was a forced increase as actual sales remained sluggish. Even if the price was raised, it would be in vain. The market returned to flat in the afternoon. The result was an increase of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, with only Baiyuan rising by 200,000 yuan to 4.3 million due to brisk sales. The Beishi market also rose early and then fell, rising by 100,000 yuan. Special high-grade japonica rice was heavily resisted at 4.15 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan, with 4,380 shi arriving.</p>
<p>Flour After the opening, under the buying of Beibang, it rose slightly, but since there were not many buyers, the market fell back due to weak demand. Bingchuan powder peaked at 1.42 million, closing at 1.4 million, the same price as last Saturday. Lao Che rose slightly by 5,000, Hongfeng rose by 7,000 yuan, and the price of miscellaneous brands of powder increased when they opened. Wheat bran fell by 10,000 yuan. Small bags of bran closed at 630,000 yuan. The price of wheat remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Steady and strong. Yellow soybeans rose early and then slackened, ultimately remaining flat. Pinghu Dou beans were active due to their small size, rising by 50,000 yuan. Selected green beans were in short supply, rising by 100,000 yuan. Corn was patronized by Beibang, rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Red sorghum was firm, green beans were flat, sesame rose slightly by 50,000 or 100,000 yuan, and the peanut market was firm. The opening was very firm. Soy oil factories opened at a high price of 8.8 million yuan, but due to the high price, buyers did not step forward, leading to a return of goods for profitable sales. The market fell back to 8.7 million yuan, rising slightly by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. The raw oil market was also ordinary. Qingdao goods rose by 100,000 yuan, Jiangbei goods rose by 50,000 yuan, and small car sesame oil rose by 50,000 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil opened at 8.6 million yuan. Soybean cake wanted to rise but lacked momentum. There were no real sales, and the price was flat.</p>

<h3>Whitehead on: The Mission of the University</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yu</p>
<p>What is the mission or purpose of a university? Why do we spend so much money to establish universities? Educators or politicians have various answers to this question. The late British philosopher Professor A. N. Whitehead wrote an article entitled "Universities and Their Function," which contains several passages concerning the mission of the university that are worthy of our attention. The following is an introduction to these passages.</p>
<p>Whitehead believes that universities are indeed schools of education and research. However, the main reason for the existence of universities is not merely to instill knowledge into students, nor is it merely to provide research opportunities for professors. These two functions can be obtained at a very low cost, without the need for such expensive institutions. Books are cheap, and the apprenticeship system is well-known. If the mission of the university is only to instill knowledge, then since the widespread use of printing in the fifteenth century, there has been no reason for the existence of the university. However, the rise and flourishing of universities occurred after the fifteenth century, and have been particularly vibrant recently. This proves that the mission of the university is not simply the instilling of knowledge.</p>
<p>According to Whitehead, the reason for the existence of the university is to maintain the connection between knowledge and the essence of life, and to combine young people and old people in a common imaginative exploration of learning. The university is for instilling knowledge, but this is the imaginative instilling of knowledge. At the very least, the imaginative instilling of knowledge is the mission that the university should accomplish for society. If a university does not perform this mission, then this university has no reason to exist. The air of excitement generated by imaginative exploration can transform knowledge. With imagination, a fact is no longer merely a fact. It adds all its possibilities to this fact. This fact is no longer a burden on our memory. This fact is a diligent worker, like the poet in our dreams, like the architect of our purposes.</p>
<p>Whitehead's so-called "Imagination," he believes, cannot be separated from facts. Imagination is a way of illuminating facts. The work of imagination is to propose those universal principles that are most useful for existing facts, and then to propose other possibilities consistent with these principles using an intellectual view. Imagination enables people to construct an intellectual vision of a new world and preserves the essence of life through the inspiration of fulfilling purposes.</p>
<p>Young people are imaginative. If the imagination of young people can be enhanced by disciplined training, then this imaginative ability can be largely retained for life. The tragedy of the world is that those who are rich in imagination lack experience, while those who are rich in experience have weak imagination. The foolish have no knowledge and act only according to imagination, while the timid have no imagination and act only according to knowledge. The mission of a university is to combine imagination and experience into one.</p>
<p>The above passages from Whitehead may seem too abstract and too vague to those with weak imagination. However, in these rather abstract words, Whitehead entrusts the university with the mission of promoting culture and creating culture. Creation or invention cannot lack knowledge or experience, and especially cannot lack imagination or reverie. Old people have experience or knowledge, but lack imagination. Young people have imagination, but lack knowledge and experience. The university brings young people and old people together, aiming to combine imagination and experience into one furnace. To supplement the old age with the imagination of youth, and to pass on the experience of the old age to the youth. This is the mission of the university.</p>
<h3>Aristotle's Classification of Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Regarding the classification of philosophy, Aristotle's own views are not very consistent, and his books do not completely match his classification. Sometimes he divides all philosophy into two parts, namely theoretical and practical; sometimes he adds a third part, called productive. In addition, he divides all questions into three types in another place: (1) logical, (2) physical, and (3) ethical. The first type of question includes two parts, namely true logical questions and metaphysical questions; - this division is almost the same as Plato's (see my book Plato, Philosophical Industry Book of World Bookstore), probably he was influenced by Plato at that time before dividing it in this way.</p>
<p>According to the previous division, the theoretical part includes geography, mathematics, metaphysics (Aristotle called it first philosophy) or theology; the practical part includes ethics and politics; in the creative part, what he expounded (or what was handed down) was only poetics and rhetoric. The physics here includes not only physics itself, but also biology, psychology, etc.—in short, it includes all knowledge about the natural world. As for logic and rhetoric, both are just tools, not the main part of philosophy. Logic is the tool of all philosophy—or the entire knowledge—rhetoric is the tool of politics. The reason why he regarded rhetoric as a tool of politics was probably because he inherited the general social view at the time, thinking that this discipline was a powerful weapon on the political stage, and politicians could use this technique to overcome everything and gain political victory. The so-called sophists at the time were people who specialized in teaching this technique.</p>
<p>The reason why Aristotle divides philosophy into theoretical, practical, and creative parts is because the purposes of each part are different. In a broad sense, all knowledge is inseparable from knowledge. But in a narrow sense, the purpose of the metal theory part is recognition (Copnitoin), pure knowledge is its object; the purpose of the practical part is action, and human behavior is its object; the purpose of the creative part is making, and the works with Chuan or beauty are its objects. The practical part is the scope of ethics and politics, and the creative part is the scope of art; but they have the same point, that is, their objects are both changeable,—behavior in matters can change, and works of objects can also change. Let's listen to Aristotle himself:</p>
<p>"Human nature has two parts: the rational part and the irrational part. The rational part can also be divided, that is, it can also be divided into two parts: (1) that which has a relationship with unchanging things. (2) That which has a relationship with changing things; because the external world has different objects, the inner human nature also has different parts corresponding to them. Originally, the reason why knowledge is possible is because there are corresponding parts in human nature. Let us call the former the part of thought, and the latter the part of planning." (Nicomaichean Ethics, BK.-VI, 514)</p>
<p>"Changing things include things that are made and things that are done. Making is different from acting, so the instinct of making is also different from the instinct of acting, and the scope of the two does not infringe on each other. … All art is related to the matter of "generation", in other words, the vocation of art lies in studying how to make something that may or may not exist into something that exists; at the same time, the source of this thing is not in itself, but in the author who created it. Art has nothing to do with those things that necessarily exist and naturally exist and whose source is in themselves. " (Nicomacgean Ethics, BK. VI. 1140a-16)</p>
<p>According to Aristotle's own words, it can be seen that the reason why he divides philosophy into these three parts is because human nature has these three instincts. In his view, human nature can be divided into two main parts, namely the rational and the irrational. Regardless of the irrational, only speaking of the rational, there are two parts: (1) the Contemplative part. (2) The Calculative part—the former has a relationship with unchanging things, and the latter has a relationship with changing things. There are two kinds of changing things, one is the things that people do, and the other is the things that people make. Therefore, in terms of human nature, there are also two different instincts that correspond to these two different objects, which are: the instinct of acting and the instinct of making which are separated from the planning part.</p>
<p>The practical part is divided into ethics and politics. In fact, Aristotle regards ethics as a part of politics. His politics has two parts: (1) on individual behavior, (2) on national behavior. The former is ethics, and the latter is true politics; in addition, he also includes economics, tactics, rhetoric, etc. into the vassals of politics. Plato presents politics as a part of ethics. His ethics is divided into personal ethics and social ethics. In fact, the former is ethics and the latter is politics. Superficially, it seems that Aristotle's view is exactly the opposite of Plato's, but in fact it is the same; ——Plato uses ethics as the net to connect individuals and society, and Aristotle uses politics as the outline to encircle individuals and countries. This is also good, that is also good, anyway, individuals cannot be separated from society and the country, and the behavior of the national society can influence the behavior of individuals.</p>
<h3>Lao Tzu on Sages and Common People</h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>Chapter 20 of the Tao Te Ching says: "Abandon learning, and you will have no worries. 'Wei' and 'A', how much difference is there between them? Good and evil, how far apart are they? What others cherish, you cannot but fear—how boundless and yet unfinished! The masses are joyous, as if feasting on a great sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace; I alone am tranquil and show no sign, like an infant who has not yet smiled, listless as if without a home. All men have more than enough, while I alone seem to have lost everything.—I have the mind of a fool, so simple! Common people are bright and clever, I alone am dull and confused; common people are sharp and discerning, I alone am muddled and ignorant. Vast am I, like the sea; aimless am I, like the ceaseless wind. All men have their uses, while I alone am stubborn and base. I alone am different from other men, and value drawing sustenance from the Mother." This chapter discusses the difference between sages and common people. I will interpret it to consult with scholars.</p>
<p>"Abandon learning, and you will have no worries," opens the following two sentences. "Wei" and "A," though different, are both responses; "good" and "evil," though distinct, are still relative. These are what ordinary people discern through learning. Ordinary people, in their studies, are confined to fixed concepts and bound by the principle of consistency of thought (Law of the Consistency of Thought), accepting 'Wei' and rejecting 'A', embracing 'good' and rejecting 'evil'. If they could understand it through the "Tao," then differences could lead to similarities, and opposites could become interconnected—but ordinary people's learning sees differences without seeing similarities, unable to eliminate relativity into the absolute. What is now to be abandoned is this kind of learning, because it only exhausts the mind and increases confusion; as for the study of the Tao, how can it be abandoned? What people fear lies in the differences, relativity and relationships, like 'Wei' and 'A', like 'good' and 'evil'. What people fear, but I should not fear, is like the meaning of "holding to the middle," adapting to the authority of others. But in reality, it is far from the Tao. "央" (Yang) means center; "未央" (Wei Yang) means not centering the Tao. In times of chaos and popular delusion, those who have attained the Tao conceal their traces within, wisely preserving themselves while awaiting change, until the moment when the tendency (the tendency of opposites becoming interconnected) arrives, then they assist its reversal, leading it back to the Tao, thereby achieving great peace and supreme order. Though the sage outwardly conceals himself to preserve himself, inwardly he clearly holds fast to the Tao. What he adheres to is always different from what the masses choose, hence the following text often contrasts "the masses..." with "I alone..." to show that the sage is ultimately different from the masses. "熙熙" (Xi Xi) should be interpreted as bustling and agitated. The enjoyment of a great sacrifice and ascending a spring terrace are what people rush to compete for—this is a metaphor for the masses busily and diligently pursuing the superficial learning of 'Wei A' and 'Good Evil,' far from centering on the "Tao." "泊" (Bo) means a boat mooring to the shore; "兆" (Zhao) means an image. "泊兮其未兆" (Bo Xi Qi Wei Zhao) is a metaphor for abiding by the Tao without attachment, dissolving traces and images into the wholeness of chaos, not revealing the sharpness and edges of using intellect in superficial learning—like an infant who has not yet smiled, whose likes and dislikes are just budding, and who neither accepts nor rejects anything, hence "as if without a home." "家人皆有餘" (Jia Ren Jie You Yu) means the masses "increase daily in learning"; "我獨若遺" (Wo Du Ruo Yi) means the sage abides by the Tao in the center, is unfamiliar with the superficial learning of the realm of form, and therefore "seems to have lost everything." However, the sage's abandonment of the learning of the realm of form is not a real loss. The sage's aim is in the Tao and not in the instrument; he constantly adheres to the "discipline of the Tao," at times holding on to the past to govern the present, and never fails to be enlightened, so he can "know without going out, name without seeing, and accomplish without doing." "愚人" (Yu Ren), the fool, is how the sage views the masses, always like fools. The sage's wisdom is inwardly contained, not pursuing things as intelligence, pure and without knowledge. From the view of the masses, their foolishness is beyond reach—this is why great wisdom seems like foolishness. "昭昭" (Zhao Zhao) and "察察" (Cha Cha) are the outward overflow of the masses' small wisdom; "昏昏" (Hun Hun) and "悶悶" (Men Men) are the inward containment of the sage's great wisdom. The masses use their intelligence on things, so they have the effects of "昭昭" and "察察" ; the sage uses his intelligence on the Tao, and the Tao has no image, so he is "昏昏" and "悶悶". But the sage's "昏昏" and "悶悶" are not like the "昏昏" and "悶悶" of the masses. The sage uses intelligence and transcends intelligence, only following the Tao, not being enslaved by things, so he can be "昏昏" and "悶悶". Only those who use intelligence and transcend intelligence can have the effect of "昏昏" and "悶悶"; when the world reaches the state of "昏昏" and "悶悶", then there will be a day of peace. Isn't the Westerners' intellectual civilization what is called "昭昭" and "察察"? Because they use intelligence but cannot transcend intelligence, they are enslaved by intelligence, leading to plunder and slaughter, and humanity suffers. "海" (Hai), the sea, is a symbol of completeness, a symbol of all-encompassing. The rise and fall of bubbles are just the surface of the sea. The rise and fall of bubbles do not affect the completeness of the sea. The sage's words and actions are the application of the Tao body. Words and actions are adapted to the times and adjusted to the circumstances, while adhering to the Tao without change, therefore "like the sea." Because it is all-encompassing, there are no biases or strong likes or dislikes, so it is detached. "颼兮" (Sou Xi) is like drifting. The sage abides by the Tao, and the Tao is emptiness. It responds to things without clinging to them, so it can use things without being used by them, therefore "no end"—"no end" means not being tied down. "衆人皆有以" (Zhong Ren Jie You Yi) picks up from the above "有餘" (You Yu), meaning that the masses take superficial learning as intelligence, and their intelligence cannot be suspended in emptiness, clinging to physical objects in the realm of form. Its effect is obvious and easily seen, and it seems as if there is something to grasp. "我獨頑且鄙" (Wo Du Wan Qie Bi) picks up from the above "昏昏悶悶" (Hun Hun Men Men). "昏昏悶悶", to the masses, truly seems stupid and base. "母" (Mu), the mother, is the Tao; the Tao is where all things come from. The Tao and things are like mother and child. "食母" (Shi Mu) means "guarding the mother," which is guarding the Tao. All people pursue things, I alone guard the Tao. This is why the sage is different from the masses.</p>
<h3>The Psychology of Rumors (3)</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>The rumor in Washington occurred in the morning and spread throughout San Francisco in the afternoon. The reason is that everyone wants to be the first to tell the news to another person. You only need to look at a spreader of rumors. When he asks you, "Do you know this news?" ... When you answer that you don't know, you can see from his beaming and triumphant expression how satisfying and exciting it is to tell a piece of news or rumor that you don't know! Therefore, everyone who holds onto a rumor spreads it with great speed. The spread of rumors is like a competition. If you spread it one step slower, others will be one step ahead, and you will not have the chance to get that victory feeling of breaking the news. This competitive mood is like a wildfire blown by the wind, causing it to rapidly sweep across the vast plains.</p>
<p>Armies and densely populated cities are ideal areas for the spread of rumors, because of the density of contact. For a rumor to be effective, it must spread quickly. For a rumor to spread quickly, it must naturally be in a place where there is a lot of contact between people. Armies and cities are the most ideal. They are not only close in distance, but also have similar interests and many of the same benefits and harms. In this way, rumors spread very quickly from one person's mouth to another person's ear. If there are no common interests and harms, then "the speaker is earnest, but the listener is indifferent," and the rumor will not "sweep through like the wind." Sometimes, it is even just to find some conversation material—attractive material—that a person can easily fabricate some rumors to talk about. To make it sound attractive, he may have to be secretive and pretend to be very confidential. These "whispers" are often some of the most dangerous rumors—the most unfounded, but the most attractive.</p>
<p>Rumors have little power at one person's mouth. Because a person cannot believe official news, it is naturally difficult for him to easily believe the words from one person's mouth. But when a rumor is spread from one person to ten, and ten people to a hundred, and then the whole society is spreading this rumor, even if you are the most cautious person, you will be shaken by the rumor. In a situation of "surrounded by the songs of Chu on all sides," even a man of iron will surrender. No one can resist the overall suggestion. Believing in her son like Zeng's mother, but when she heard everyone in the city saying that her son had killed someone, she couldn't help but be moved. So some rumors, although they were clearly spread by oneself, and one clearly knows that their source is completely impossible, but after being spread again and again, until the whole society is saying so, he himself does not dare to disbelieve its authenticity. The power of the masses is so great! You may not believe it, but the fact is that rumors not only deceive those who listen to rumors, they often also confuse the rumor-monger himself. (To be continued) 19</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Academic World (19)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Political Atmosphere</p>
<p>Liang Rengong's family letters contain words about the political atmosphere in the early years of the Republic of China, which are still worth reflecting on and deeply considering even after twenty or thirty years. He described the political situation in Beiping in the early Republic: "In the past two months, more than 70,000 people have been active in the Xiheyan area to seek positions. Everyone is vying for a piece of the pie. This is China's greatest affliction." He once said that China's ailment is that all the intelligent and talented people in the country flock to politics. Rengong was not against officials, but he believed that without changing the atmosphere, there would be no hope for a clean and bright government. To change the atmosphere and remedy the current evils, the main points are nothing more than the loyalty and sincerity advocated by Zeng Wenzheng.</p>
<p>Rengong believed that when discussing political parties, one should first emphasize the distinction between righteousness and profit. How can those who see profit and forget righteousness be called party members? "Once the two words 'power' and 'profit' are uttered, then contention and theft will emerge, either secretly or openly, and their origin will be elusive. Those who enter it must be cunning, treacherous, and ruthless to compete with each other. Now I know why Mencius did not speak of profit, which is profound and enlightening." He also argued that building a party requires strict discipline and closeness to the hearts of the people. His words are not in vain.</p>
<p>Rengong once held the view of "talent economy," saying that if a person wants to serve the country or society, he should make the most of his strengths. He also said that there is no such thing as a small or big matter in the world. As long as you do your best within your responsibilities, you are a first-class person. Rengong claimed that he always sought good assistants when handling affairs, and that a leader should be diligent in using people and leisurely in managing affairs. Regarding the importance of group action, he said, "I always inevitably take the blame for others, but because of this, I feel the pain of not having a group. There are indeed many capable people among my friends, with correct morals, knowledge, and principles, but without the unified action of a group, not only can they not exert their influence, but they often negate their influence due to inconsistency, which is truly painful." (Said at the age of 55) He also said that to accomplish things through people, one must humble oneself to accommodate others, which is a very insightful statement.</p>
<p>Rengong also said, "To accomplish great things today, one must not maintain the boundaries of the same school or different schools. To handle the great affairs of the world, one must gather all the heroes of the world." "One of the drawbacks of my own school is that I must only accept and employ those whose talents and abilities are subject to my control. This will inevitably not lead to heroes. Those who are easy to control must be less talented, so what benefit do I gain from them? Therefore, one must exhaust all methods to recruit those who are difficult to drive and difficult to control. However, to recruit them, one cannot rely on small tricks, but must rely on openness, generosity, sincerity, and impartiality." This statement can be said to be aimed at the root cause of China's political problems. Rengong once said, "I grow more fearful as I experience more." He also said, "In the past, as an onlooker, I criticized, thinking that the affairs of the world could be understood in one or two sentences, but now I truly dare not lightly blame others." These few words contain many hidden pains.</p>
<p>The foundation of politics lies in education, and not only in narrow school education, but also in broad social education. Rengong said in the late Qing Dynasty, "Western philosophers say that representatives are the image of the national psychology. The members of the modern consultative bureau have roughly sketched this image for us to see together." In the second year of the Republic of China, Rengong was so angry that he wanted to cut ties with politics. In the fifth year, he agreed with his comrades that when the military situation was slightly calmer, he would devote himself to social education, as Confucius said, "This is also governing." He believed that China's greatest affliction was the lack of flourishing scholarship and the decline of morality. Without making great efforts in social education, the national situation could hardly be saved. To seek fundamental political reform, one must start with the national psychology. To transform the national psychology, one must start with social education. The main tool of social education is public opinion, and the soul of public opinion is thought, so thought is the driving force for creating a new era. This consistent theory is truly an unchanging truth.</p>

<h3>A Dim Light</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>The invention of fire was a major event for mankind, so myths include the imprisoned Prometheus, whom Greek scholars turned into a lasting dramatic play. Although it is a fable, we can imagine that before primitive humans could use fire, many people must have sacrificed to it, for example, children with no knowledge got burned while playing with fire. As Lao Tzu said, "Arms are like fire; those who do not know how to handle them will burn themselves," which looks ordinary but contains some pain. In mythology, Zhurong氏 won the battle against Yu Wang (榆罔) with great fire, and even in the Ming Dynasty, Lu Xixing's story of the Investiture of the Gods still retained the story of the Fire Virtue True Lord Luo Yi. If it weren't for Princess Longji's purifying water bottle, Xiqi City would have almost been reduced to ashes. Therefore, whenever I went to the Fire God Temple as a child, I couldn't help but feel a sense of inexplicable terror towards the idol who had a redder face than a drunkard and an "electric eye" on his forehead.</p>
<p>Perhaps what I have seen is too biased towards the side that makes people nervous. Steam and electricity are both generated by fire. Without it, would mankind have modern happiness? That's right. The fire that burns people and destroys houses can give us tow trucks and machines to drive, changing the face of the entire world. Materialists place the center of historical progress on the use of tools, but why not put it on fire? Not only is the foundation of modern capitalist production—machines—powered by fire, but also the smelting of iron and copper in ancient times. Which one did not rely on fire? Primitive people used stone tools precisely because they did not yet know the age of fire. However, this great fire also caused a great disaster. The leap forward in society has turned the flame of production into the flames of war, and the suffering and happiness people have suffered are almost unbalanced. Radicals are even more unable to endure this, and this spark that has not been extinguished often one day will turn into a blazing flame and evolve into a prairie fire.</p>
<p>Presumably, Prometheus stealing fire for mankind meant that the immortals in the heavens were enjoying the light and happiness of fire—it is nonsense to say that gods do not eat cooked food. If there really are gods, and the gods are righteous and intelligent, they must first know how to burn things with fire—while mankind was still in the stage of ignorance, eating blood and sleeping on skins, so they had such a bold and generous gift. However, causing the fire to spread was not Prometheus's original intention. Here, of course, one must hate those in charge of the fire, why they could not guide it to work and cook for most people, but instead created opportunities, even piling wood on the fire. The lessons of the past have been overturned, but the mistakes are not corrected. The foolishness of mankind can indeed be admired.</p>
<p>Burning, fire, and disasters are unfortunate no matter what. However, darkness is really hard to endure. This makes me think of the "light of a dim fire" that the ancients often spoke of, which is not a little light. Electric lights are indeed very bright, but for someone who has just emerged from the darkness, it is too blinding. Perhaps a bean oil lamp or a candle would be more likely to make people see things clearly. Gradually expand the light again. We should always know about the pupil dilation and contraction that physiology talks about. Generally, this line of light can indeed lead most people to walk, or as our legend says, Che Wuzi reading by collecting fireflies, perhaps he would not let the wildfire run wild. Then, the merit would not be small.</p>
<p>The so-called light is precisely accumulated from dim flames. The ancients said it well, the beginning of the river flow is just a trickle. Mencius used this reason to advocate that people should develop the beginnings of goodness. For example, "the beginning of a fire burning, the beginning of a spring reaching," the beginning of a fire burning is probably all a faint light, not like a match, starting with a bang. Everything in the world that is not made up of small things often cannot withstand temptation and tempering. Isn't the Xinhai Revolution a golden lesson? The ancients also said, "A gust of wind does not last all morning, and a heavy rain does not last all day." On the one hand, extreme prosperity is difficult to sustain, and on the other hand, people are a little tired of this kind of thing, so they say these somewhat resentful words. We should treat it as human nature and not stubbornly stick to physics. Some people express complete aversion to the Chinese traditional doctrine of the mean. It is true that the mean may sometimes become a shield of stubbornness, but for the way of life, it is a consistent requirement of mankind. The frigid zone and the tropical zone are not suitable for settlement. Only the temperate zone is the center of culture. In ancient times, the barbarians who lived in the subarctic zone always wanted to migrate south. The Xiongnu and Xianbei in China and the Normans in the West are all examples of this. This clearly shows that there is a natural tendency towards the mean in physiology. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all aimed at comfort to the extreme, and although airplanes and trains are developing speed as much as possible, there is also a limit. If it is exceeded, it is not something that physiology can support, even if there is artificial oxygen to breathe. The Chinese cannot say that they do not understand these things in life. They also talk about it completely in philosophy. One tight, one loose, one rigid, one soft, are all good, the difference is that words and actions do not correspond. What ordinary people and the majority of the people want is not a burning wildfire or coldness, but a uniform and suitable temperature. Unfortunately, although there is a lot of cultural accumulation and a large population, this long-term malaria with irregular cold and heat is enough to destroy it. Thinking of this, I cannot help but sigh three times and feel that I want to jump out of the fire pit but have no way to do it.</p>
<h3>Liang Hongzhi's Fate and Physiognomy</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>In Mr. Yun's article "The Art of Judging People" in Free Talk, it is mentioned that one can see a person's "lifespan," "poverty and success," "loyalty and treachery," and "good and evil" from their physiognomy. Today, the art of fate and physiognomy is regarded as superstition by most people, but I am afraid that the number of people who have consulted fortune-tellers and physiognomists still accounts for the majority, right? I have always just played along with others when it comes to fortune-telling and physiognomy, and I don't believe it, but Liang Hongzhi's fate and physiognomy do have some surprising aspects. I will now describe them one by one.</p>
<p>In the 27th year of the Republic of China, Liang organized the "Renovation Government" under the orders of the Japanese. Before the meeting, his whereabouts were secretive. Some people said that he lived in the Weida Hotel. One day, I met my friend Shi Wenfu on Avenue Joffre. Shi was good at judging people's physiognomy. The two of us went into a coffee shop to chat. Shi talked about how he had recently judged Liang's physiognomy. If he came out this time, the result would probably not be good. I asked him why. Shi said: "Liang's eyes droop at the corners, and his shape is like a pig. When a pig is fattened, doesn't it always have to be slaughtered?" This is the first oddity.</p>
<p>Liang and Huang Rong both had reputations as poets, and people called them Huang Liang. Liang studied at the university, and Huang graduated from the Translation College. He was one class behind me. I knew Liang because of Huang. In the early years of the Republic of China, there was a person named Ru Ziwen in the old capital, from Penglai County, Shandong Province, who lived in a hotel in Xiheyan and was very famous for fortune-telling. One day, I went with Guo Zize and Liang to have our fortunes told. Each of us reported our birthdates. Ru used an abacus to calculate and said: "Liang's fate is the best, but after the age of sixty, he must retire to seclusion to preserve himself." Liang was working on a small matter at the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau at the time. Hearing this, he was quite pleased with himself. A few days later, I ate roast duck with Huang Lansheng at Tongfulou. After that, we went to Ru's place together and asked how good Liang's fate would be in the future and how bad it would be in the end. Ru said: "According to my Bagua calculations, Le will be able to reach the position of Prime Minister of the State in the future, but after the age of sixty, if he does not listen to my words and withdraw quickly, I am afraid that he will be killed." This is the second oddity.</p>
<p>When Japan surrendered, Chen Qun was the only one in the Nanjing Wang government who committed suicide. Before committing suicide, Chen left a short note, saying: "When the founding of the country was announced, I was told that if it failed, I would die for it. I am going now. Please take care of yourself." Liang hesitated and could not make up his mind, and was eventually executed by firing squad. Liang's poetry and prose were amazingly talented and truly a talent of his generation. One wrong thought caused people to lament the beautiful woman's misfortune. Alas!</p>
<h3>Xu Wenchang on Ghostwriting</h3>
<p>Ghostwriting for others has become a custom in modern times. It seems that this was rare in ancient times. I recently read Xu Wenchang's small preface to the Collection of Drafts, and his discussion of writing for others is very interesting. I am copying it below:</p>
<p>"In ancient times, there were few people who wrote articles for others, because those who could write were either eminent or impoverished: the eminent were noble, and it was impossible to ask them to ghostwrite; the impoverished were of high moral character, and there was no way to obtain them, so how could they ghostwrite? Wei Yuwen was unfortunately like a horse for plowing, situated between the non-eminent and the non-hidden, so people could ghostwrite for him, and Wei could not forbid it. Moreover, the current system uses timely meanings, and those who obtain official positions through the old profession do not write ancient prose, or even if they do, the gifts they send are a hundred times greater than in ancient times, so they have no choice but to resort to ghostwriting, and those who ghostwrite must be scholars of low status, not recluses. Therefore, one can observe people and examine the world through ghostwriting."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that those who are ghostwritten for are sad, and the social atmosphere is also sad. I wonder what the famous people of today think of this? (Hongxian)</p>
<h3>Dueling in Italy</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>Dueling is very popular in post-war Italy, but it is also very safe. It can be said that no one has died unjustly in a duel.</p>
<p>The weapons are pistols and swords, which can be chosen at will. Most duels are fought with pistols, because in the memory of Italians, no duelist has ever been hit by a bullet, although a few assistants have suffered collateral damage and had their pants burned by gunpowder. The ideal component of the gunpowder in the bullets fired by both sides is to shoot out with a gentle "psst" sound, so that the bullet falls to the ground as soon as it leaves the muzzle and rolls forward gently along the ground. A few days before the duel, the weapons are first tested in the dueling arena. The distance between the two ends is thirty or forty yards—even a skilled shooter would find the target too small at this distance. Two paper mannequins are placed at each end of the arena, and then they are shot with guns. If the bullet hits the paper target, it is not qualified; if it passes through the paper, the amount of gunpowder should be drastically reduced. In short, the most ideal amount of gunpowder must be tested before real people can be used as targets.</p>
<p>Another type of duel is with swords. After the expensive preliminary work of booking a sword, hiring an instructor, and selecting a venue is completed, the formal duel begins. The duelists take off their shirts, hold their swords, and stand far apart. The instructor and referee is the real hero in the duel. He takes the sword and stands between the two sides, watching them not to fight too close. As soon as the two sides' swords touch, he calls out: "Stop!" Then he separates them with his own sword. After that, every time the two people get within striking distance, he does so. If one side really wants to end the other side's life—but this is rare—he hurriedly uses his sword to block it.</p>
<p>In the end, the two people inevitably fall down exhausted, or the instructor is stabbed, or one or both sides suffer minor injuries to their arms, or both sides simply stop out of exhaustion, and then everyone kisses each other, and a duel full of dark clouds disappears—they each go home and brag about it.</p>
<h3>Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>— Shao Yun</p>
<p>The torrent of material and utilitarian interests is overflowing, and the changes of attack, slander, and deceit are intricate, which has made society as dark as a pile of old paint, and made the world as chaotic as tangled hemp, which is difficult to sort out. Therefore, the various ethical standards of right and wrong, good and evil seem to have shaken their foundations.</p>
<p>I remember there was such a joke: two people, A and B, ate a side dish of bamboo shoots mixed with pork. Another gentleman saw it, and because A was good to him and B had a gap with him, he made his "monthly criticism": Mr. A is really thrifty, he even mixes some bamboo shoots in the pork; Mr. B is really extravagant, he even puts pork in the bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>This is probably what is called "right and wrong" today, right?</p>
<h3>The Habit of Writing Articles</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>When writing articles, everyone has their own habits. Some like a bright and clean window, calmly wielding the pen, writing each character meticulously, so that the manuscript becomes a wonderful calligraphy model. Others, amidst the deafening noise of mahjong and conversations, go their own way, focusing on the eternal cause of writing with a pen in hand.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, I translated an article about writers from the Atlantic Monthly for a weekly magazine, which mentioned the different habits of Western writers when writing. Some like to drink coffee, some like to have a black person scratch their scalp, and some even need to arrange a banana scent in the room, so that their thoughts flow when they smell it, which is close to a quirk.</p>
<p>As for me, I also have some special habits. I often like to start writing two or three articles at the same time. When I run out of inspiration for one article, I put it aside and choose another topic to write. After writing a considerable number of words, I suddenly have an epiphany and continue with the first article. I write in segments in two or three articles in this way. Sometimes, I can finish the article after writing one or two more sections, sometimes I have to write it in five or six times, and sometimes I don't even write it anymore.</p>
<p>Secondly, some people like to publish articles in different newspapers and magazines at the same time, that is, the so-called "prolific writer." But I like to write articles one by one and publish them in order, and I don't want to send them all out at once.</p>
<p>In the cartoonist's pen, the writer's study is often messy, with books, newspapers, and pictures piled up everywhere, and paper, ink, brushes, and inkstones are randomly placed. This seems to reflect the author's general lack of knowledge of tidying up and aesthetic concepts, only knowing how to write. Perhaps eight or nine out of ten writers have this habit. If gold-lettered, leather-bound masterpieces are neatly placed on the bookshelf, and fancy fountain pens are inserted into the marble pen holder, it may be difficult to write a single word.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that the writing tool - fountain pen or brush - has its own advantages. If you use a fountain pen, the writing is smooth, and you can record fleeting thoughts like a race. If you use a brush, you can have room for ideas while dipping the brush and grinding the ink. In short, in my humble opinion, it is better to use a fountain pen when writing factual articles, and a brush is better for writing profound theoretical texts, so that the ink on the pen tip will not stagnate by the time you think of the next sentence.</p>
<h3>Small Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Teach children how to speak; when children grow into youth, teach them how to speak again; it is not easy to learn this lesson—speaking. Suddenly, they are old. People again want him to be silent, hoping he better not speak.</p>
<p>The best actor on stage plays different roles in different plays, perhaps rarely—or even never—playing himself.</p>
<p>On the stage of life: you may be your father's good son, your wife's good husband, your children's good father, your compatriots' good brother, your servants' good master, your colleagues' good boss, your mother-in-law's good son-in-law... Have you ever thought about: are you your own best self?</p>
<p>If grapes weren't sour and lemons weren't sweet, there might be more strife in the world.</p>
<p>The dolls in the shop window are all beautiful, but the most beautiful is the one that is bought by someone.</p>
<h3>Chicken and Cat</h3>
<p>— Gao Junbin</p>
<p>"The mountain house is good, full of life and growing, chickens protect their chicks and compete to protect their mother, cats give birth to one kitten, just like their mother, creatures are also kind."</p>
<p>The above is a quatrain of Wangjiangnan, written by my father (Editor's note: The author of this article is Mr. Gao Chuiwan's son.) a few years ago, longing for his hometown and reminiscing about old dreams. The entire draft has sixty-four sections, describing the scenery of the mountain house such as wind, flowers, snow, moon, moving plants, flying and diving creatures, vividly. Mr. Yao Yuqin read it and named his domestic cat "Wanyu" after it. When Mr. Feng Zikai read it, he took the meaning of the above quatrain and drew a picture to present it. Last year was my father's seventieth birthday. He firmly declined the celebration, only celebrating Dongpo's birthday and holding an elegant winter gathering. He then made this painting into poetry stationery and distributed it to relatives and friends. My father named the stationery "Chicken and Cat Stationery," and those who received it praised it as wonderful. (Mr. Feng's painting is shown in the picture)</p>
<h3>Writing in Prison</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>An American state prison committee once expressed its opinion on writing by inmates in prison, saying:</p>
<p>"Almost every inmate in prison is willing to engage in writing for life, so prison schools allow inmates to have the freedom to write. Although few are truly successful, many famous writers have completed masterpieces in prison, which is undeniable."</p>
<p>Looking back at history, there are many examples to prove it: like the most famous playboy in history, the so-called Walter Raleigh who wore jewels on his shoes and pearls in his ears - the suave flatterer who once laid a new coat on the ground for Queen Elizabeth of England to step on, also wrote in prison. For political reasons, he spent fourteen years in prison. - In his simple, dirty and narrow prison cell, he stared at the walls covered with endless mud. His hands and feet eventually became stiff due to severe rheumatism, but he endured all the pain and completed many beautiful poems in prison, which are still selected as teaching materials by many universities and specialized schools! (Editor's note: Raleigh was later beheaded.)</p>
<p>The writer who sold more than six million copies - O. Henry, the master of American short stories, was once unjustly arrested and imprisoned, and sentenced to five years in prison; although being imprisoned is a shame, for O. Henry, if he had not been a prisoner, how could he have been able to write with peace of mind, so that his name would be immortal!</p>
<p>John Bunyan was arrested and imprisoned for preaching, and served twelve years in prison. At first, in order to take care of the lives of his wife and four poor children outside the prison, he had to busy himself making lace with his ten fingers in order to exchange money to supplement his family. But later, the great thoughts and inspirations in his mind suddenly began to surge, making him unable to bear it any longer, and he had to write in the cold, damp, and dark dungeon. Who knew that he would complete an amazing masterpiece, which is "The Pilgrim's Progress." Now there are translations in all countries of the world. Except for the Bible, it is the first book in the world to be sold most widely.</p>
<p>Cervantes' immortal work, Don Quixote, was also written in prison. In addition, Voltaire, Oscar Wilde, and Anthony Burgess all had writings in prison; even Hitler's autobiography, "Mein Kampf," which has sold two million copies, was also half-written by Hitler in prison.</p>
<p>Two hundred and sixty years ago, Richard Lovelace was also arrested and imprisoned in an English prison, which resulted in him writing an immortal poem in prison, and even the prison became famous for it. This is a love poem sent to his lover, and its title is "To Althea, from Prison." The poem says: Stone walls do not a prison make, Nor iron bars a cage; Minds innocent and quiet take That for an hermitage; If I have freedom in my love, And in my soul am free, Angels alone, that soar above, Enjoy such liberty.</p>
