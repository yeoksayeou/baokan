<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務院以備忘錄一件，提交衆院外委會，通知國會稱：美國之軍事援助，已首途接濟中國之反共軍隊。備忘錄透露，合同數份已被批准，將美國剩餘戰具以最低價格售與中國政府，戰具中包括飛機及軍火。外交人士稱：中國借款技術團亦已接獲保證，悉美國陸軍將在太平洋區遍搜剩餘飛機，以供援華。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕衆院已接到報吿，證明美國已同意折價以彈藥及空軍配備售予中國，但未發表總數。僅悉其中包括：（一）一月七日簽訂之合同，規定以馬里亞那島之剩餘彈藥，以原價百分之一售於中國。（二）一月三十日簽訂之合同，規定每元折價一角七分半，出售美國境內所有剩餘物資，僅某種飛機除外。（三）去年十二月八日簽訂之合同，規定以軍備租借法項下艦船九十六艘讓與中國，並不取費，原價爲六千七百萬元。去年度曾售於中國彈藥一億三千萬發，每元折價一角，另有C—46型運輸機一百五十架出售，原價每架廿七萬六千元，實售每架五千元</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕國務卿馬歇爾廿日警吿國會稱：若無美國之援助，中國有崩潰之可能性。若此事果眞發生，將「使吾人在日本之處境極爲嚴重」，並且「美國在朝鮮之地位將難以保持」。同時，馬氏承認國會應儘速進行援歐計劃之立法案，將援華擱置一邊，直至援歐計劃獲得通過。馬氏稱：由於中國「第三黨」不致出現接管政府，故一旦政府崩潰，長江以北將完全淪入共軍之手。關於中國軍事局勢之「惡化」情形，馬氏稱：國民政府軍隊「無得勝之望，除非有健全之底層及優良之領袖」，此項條件非目前所能解決。中國軍事機構之致命傷，乃爲「愚昧之農村壯丁抽徵後，未經訓練即直接派入部隊作戰」。渠在中國時，曾勸吿中國政府，此種壯了在入伍前應先行訓練，並向中國政府之耍員再三言之，惟彼等雖極表贊同，而仍一無所爲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕共和黨議員周以德，不顧國務部長馬歇爾之意見，再接再厲要求軍事援華，昨夜建議請陳納德飛回華盛頓，向衆院外交委員會陳述意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕共和黨議員施密斯，廿日在衆議院外委會宣布，將要求麥克阿瑟元帥平日由東京返美，指導援華及其他遠東問題。民主黨議員亞兩門稱：援外計劃對於美國及全世界均異常重要，現雖無人提及麥帥爲共和黨總統候選人一事曾經廣泛討論，但予深恨利用援外方案以遂其政治目的。議長伊克斯登亦稱，此項動議，定由於政治原因。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿一日電〕麥克阿瑟元帥廿一日發表文吿稱：「美國人士主張本人歸國向衆議院外委會申述本人對援華計劃之意見，足見相愛之深，本人無任感激，然竊以爲該委員會不必堅持前議，日本目前之政治局勢動盪不已，政府在交替過程中，本人爲職務所覊，實無法在現時稍離職守」。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕隱存於綏南托克托縣竹拉沁村之「西北政府」頃已爲國軍綏南指糧官劉萬春所剿滅，主席韓國良（綽號砲台玉）亦被俘，押解歸綏，其禁衛軍五名，亦繳械投誠。據悉，竹村位於歸綏·薩拉齊·托克托三縣交界，民性强悍；韓原爲一地主，曾肄業太原法政學校，回鄉後即自編保甲，組織鄕勇，並在村築有高四丈，厚五尺之三車碉堡一座，附近七八保人民俱聽其號令，日寇侵歸綏包頭時，韓於抵抗二年後始南逃沙漠，勝利後韓亦復員回鄕，重過其「砲合王」生涯，所轄區內，向不向政府納糧，區內學校不用國定本敎科書，而以其自著「治國平天下書」代之，去歲托縣派警察廿餘名前往探察該「王國」眞相，被韓治下民衆數千予以毆擊；舊歷年前，伊盟準旗吿急，綏南指揮官劉萬春恐韓與共匪聯結一氣，乃派隊進剿，一舉剿滅。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿日〕國務卿馬歇爾在衆議院外交委員會發表證詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>「當討論對華援助之時，應予認淸者，乃中國問題之解決，大部份係爲中國人民本身之問題，決定援助方案之基礎及程序，其巨大困難，在於中國之軍事及經濟情勢。　迄今止，中國經濟問題解決之主要阻力，乃係內戰，此內戰已使中國政府之國內及國外匯兌財源乾涸，財產繼續受損毁，經濟生活，經常遭困亂，而復興亦復受陷。共產黨軍隊業已造成可怖之破壞，而傷害中國經濟，此乃彼等所宣稱之目的——强迫造成一次經濟之崩潰。</p>
<p>中國政府在其目前之嚴重經濟困難中之正　極需要援助，惟中國政治，經濟及財政情况係如此之不穩與不安，以致不可能製訂實際，有效與長期之整個經濟復典方案。雖然如此，美國政府對於中國目前之嚴重局勢，必須予以援助，以協助延緩其目前經濟之迅速敗壞，從而使其獲得喘息機會，而令中國政府可以發動重要步驟，以求達成比較穩定之經濟。</p>
<p>當考慮此一方案之際，其中牽涉有多種因素，而下列因素則似具最大重要性者。</p>
<p>中國爲一地大人衆之國家，長江以北之交通，除沿海航行外，幾不復存在。地方政府往往腐敗不堪，對於救濟措施之管理，不能賴其協助，根深蒂固集團之政治控制，實在恢復中國經濟穩定所需克服之重大困難。政病目下所進行之內戰，特別由於地理上之不利（交通之暴露及　長與應付游擊戰事之困難）在總部各階層中需要一種高明之積極領袖才能，但事實上則缺乏此種領袖才能。內戰使國家預算負担增加百分之七十以上，目下財政措施，全賴發行紙幣，工業生產低落，運輸設備竄劣，運輸之缺乏，尤其影響糧食之運送，結果造成瘋在之通貨膨脹及不可避免之投機與囤積。</p>
<p>在考處美國所採取援華之措施時，余以爲必須注意一點，即援華不能與援歐並論，目前尙不能預言援助何時可吿終止，至於穩定幣制之基金，據我國貨幣專家之意見，需要甚大之數量，而此種基金，在目前內戰　在進行之時，大半將為浪費。　於此種情形，援華計劃不應包括實際担保中國經濟之前途。美國之行動，對於中國政府之行爲及其政治·經濟與軍事各方面，不應負直接責任。</p>
<p>建議中之援華計劃，將對華提供五億七千萬美元之經濟協助，至一九四九年六月卅日爲止。其中五億一千萬美元將包括民用物資大半如糧食與原料之教低限度輸入，其餘六千萬美元，則作爲主要建設計劃之用。援華計劃集中於各種物資，確信其對於中國平民經濟，能有最高限度之幫助，並保證每一美元，能發生最大援助之作用。</p>
<p>中國輸入需要之總額，鑒於生產與貿易情形之普遍不安定，以及在若干地區之混亂情形，不能加以準確估計，因此，吾人覺得計劃中所列舉之各項商品，能相當合理地加以確定，所以該項計劃將滿足最需要之商品要求，當然中國尙需其他輸入品，包括並不納入計劃之內之民用商品及軍用供應品，此外，中國尙有若干國際金融負担。</p>
<p>爲滿足此等外匯上之額外需求起見，中國可使用其本身之若干金融資源。此等資源包括從輸出方面之收入，自僑匯出售剩餘財產以及外國政府與慈善機關在中國所作費用等方面之零星收入，最後，茍屬需要，尙有中國之黄金與外匯準備，此項準備，截止一九四八年一月一日，估計總額等於二億七千四百萬元。此一數額，能因中國方面改善外匯方面之純收入而予以增加。在另一方面，此一數額，能因別無其他資金可以羅致，必須動用準備金以應付一九四八年一月一日後必須付出之款項而見减少。</p>
<p>在提出之計劃中，建議此項計劃山根據法律而成立之機關辦理，良以此一機關之成立，即以處理對外各項援助計劃爲目的，或則在此項機關成立之前，暫時由國務院與政府中直接有關之其他機關會同辦理。給於此項援助之種種條件，應在與中國政府簽訂之協定中加以規定，此等條件，將與給予歐洲國家援助之條件同樣考慮，惟須依中國情形之不同而予以調整。</p>
<p>馬卿提出一項文件　概述經濟援華計劃</p>
<p>馬歇爾在作證時除對各委員答覆質詢外，並提出一文件：概述「經濟援華之計劃」。該文件中除分析援華計劃下建議遝送之物資外，並詳細討論該計劃之行政及其他條款，中國經濟地位之事實，美國以前之經濟援助及中國自助之諾言。</p>
<p>所列之物資，除棉花·五穀·及煤油產物外，爲肥料·烟草·金屬物·藥料·煤斤及主要配備之零件。</p>
<p>該綱要內稱：自一九三七年以來，美政府對華之援助共計廿九億零五百八十萬美元，其中十四億三千六百九千萬美元係在對日勝利日以後，並包括租借，剩餘物資之出售，聯總之救濟（美國部份），美國援外計劃基金及進出口銀行之貸款。</p>
<p>論及可能之建設計劃，該綱要並說明中國曾另外申請進出口銀行之貸款約三億美元，但稱：「此等申請，在中國目前情况之下，恐進出口銀行不致予以通過，但將來若干計劃可能適合進出口銀行貸款之資格」。綱要內稱：「進出口銀行拒絕以前各次申請之主要理由爲：「該銀行不能覓得償還之合理保證」。</p>
<p>執行援華計劃之雙方協定，將授權美方管理人，決定在六千萬美元項下所負起之個別建設計劃，管理人並有權修改運送物資數量之列表。（美衆院質詢情形刋二版左角）</p>

<h3 id="c21">東京裁判的最後階段 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>東京遠東國際軍事法庭審訊日本戰犯，已到了最後階段；本月九日復開的『最終辯論庭』，檢察官及被吿雙方，各自宣讀辯狀，並就開審廿個月以來法庭所接受之一切證件及全部法庭紀錄，加以分析檢討，各作論斷。被吿說戰爭行爲基於自衛，向法庭要求予以無罪的裁決，首席檢察官季楠代表檢察官團，向法庭激烈攻擊被吿的自衛謬論，大聲疾呼予東條等戰犯以極刑處分。檢察官的總控訴書，於十九日宣讀完竣，季楠已返華府，數星期後再返東京聽判。現在，檢察官與被吿的駁辯階段終了，論理不能再發表任何意見，今後的七星期內，將是各法官工作的緊張階段，各戰犯罪行的衡量，生死的決定，均繫於法官的投票，和判決書的編製。東京裁判的重要性，大於紐倫堡審判；舉世注視東京裁判的結果，過於紐倫堡審判。我們中國受日本軍閥侵略，荼毒最久，災害最大，我們關心這一重大事件的結束，自應在此最後關鍵，表示意見，以供遠東法庭的參考。</p>
<p>第一·起訴一級戰犯定讞問題根據聯合國檢察官「日本一級戰犯公訴書」，被指控的戰犯，計有東條英機，土肥原等廿八名，除松岡洋右，永野修身二名死亡及大川周明因神經病被免訴，而倖免於波茨坦宣言第十條之「嚴厲之處罰」以外，現尙有廿五名。自一九四六年五月三日開始密判起，迄最後辯論階段終了，歷時廿一個月，疲勞辯論，反對質詢，個別辯證，時問的拖延，給予被吿若千有利的機會。彼輩安坐東京巢鴨監獄內，過着平靜的生活，辯護律師替他們製造「無罪的證據』，最近東京栽判研究會出版「東條英機宣誓供述書」，洋洋廿餘萬言，風行日本民間，尙意圖爭取最後的民意。儘管她們强詞奪理，製造僞證，發表謬論，消滅不了血臘的事實，和　班可考的罪證，她們曾欠世人的血債，必須要獲得償還，必須要在公理之前被淸算。季楠檢察官二月十一日向法庭指控這干戰犯，發動侵略戰爭，爲國際最大罪行，爲違反和平之陰謀。彼輩在侵略爭中之殺戮，爲對人類之謀殺，　此等罪行，在此次審判中朱獲處罰，波茨坦宣言勢將變爲無用之具文。我們敬佩季楠正義的呼聲，我們要求法庭各法官，接受檢察官的控訴，和一切的罪證，並重視聯合國輿論的趨勢，迅將一級戰犯定讞！若　的罪狀，第一是破壞和平，第二是發動侵略戰爭；第三是違背人道，並有違反戰爭法規及慣例的罪行。按法理依先例，這一干人犯應一律處以極刑，毫不寬恕。如果這干侵略元凶，罪行有輕重之分，多數或少數逍遙法外，不受神聖之法被破壞，人類所信守的最高道德標準將陷分離，這必爲世局人心帶來更大的不幸和災難。因之我們認爲：爲維護法理的莊嚴，爲貫澈「侵略戰爭是罪犯」的原則，我們有權利要求早日將這干人犯判處極刑！</p>
<p>第二·未起訴戰罪嫌疑的處置日本侵略戰爭包括「滿洲事變」，中日事變，太平洋事變等階段，參加備戰陰謀屠殺行動的，包括軍閥，財閥，官僚，外交，思想文化等人物，麥克阿瑟元帥降臨東京時，曾五次拘捕戰罪嫌疑犯百餘人，著名戰犯大多落網。誰知兩年以來，檢察官提出公訴的，僅東條等廿八名，其他各犯均未起訴，有的是釋放了，有的是免訴了，最近季楠氏又向華府建議釋放戰犯廿名，內有罪惡昭彰之軍閥，以及曾在侵略中國陰謀中具有積極作用之官僚多名，如岸信介（東條內國之商相，「滿洲」五統治者之一），安　紀三郞（羅　　司令），西尾　造（駐華日軍統帥），多田　（陸軍副　　　　　　　　勇（兒玉財關上海首領），谷正之（駐汪僞　　大使　，　　　吉郞（侵華時務首腦）等，據二月十六日奮訊，華府已採納季楠建議，對西尾等不加審訊。不審訊即爲「無罪」，「無罪」特蒙受開釋之恩。我們認爲這片面行動是達　　，我檢察官向哲濬已提出反對，並希望我國政府速採　當步驟。我們認爲時機緊急，謹向遠東法庭和我國政府要求：第一，在一級戰犯審判結束的階段，應檢討未起訴戰犯的罪行，立即繼續提出公訴，不使罪惡昭彰的戰犯，脫離法網；第三，應抗議片面釋放戰犯的行動，凡在中國犯有違反和平與人這罪之任何罪犯，要求引渡中國，依法審判。我們向遠東法庭呼籲，並　　遠東委員會力爭。</p>
<p>第三。日　應否視為戰犯日　裕仁應否列爲戰事罪犯，聯合國意見頗不一致。依波茨坦宣言：「欺騙和錯誤領導日本人民，使其從事於征服世界者的權威和勢力，必須永久予以排除。」這明明是指日本「天皇」而言。後來日本投降，要求不予「天皇』以損害，美國是允許了。日政府應否採用「天皇制」，依波茨坦宣言解釋，要讓日本人民自由決定，可是波茨坦精神，幷不能解釋「天皇無罪」，而且許多長略文獻，表徵「天皇」曾參預侵略計劃的。遠東法庭總控訴書，說明日皇將不負戰罪，是值得懷疑的。我們對日皇毫無報復心理，當世人鰓　過濾此問題時，盟國與論不得不將是非作明確的研究。甘地曾說：「事實是法律的四分之三」，甘地饒恕他的敵人和反對者，但他要求是非大白，眞理凈化。</p>
<p>總之，東京裁判已近最後階段，我們靜待日本櫻花怒放之前，遠東法庭完成戰犯的宣判程序，對此　掀動使節大戰　害人類的禍首，予以懲處，爲世界樹立祥和，爲人類伸展公道，這是我們的願望。</p>
<p>東北華北地區　發電廠被匪破壞　主要電力設備損失慘重</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕據行政院新聞局公佈，勝利後，我國電力事業經資委會悉力整理修復，發電量突飛猛晋，前途殊可樂觀，惜主要電力設備分佈於東北華北等區，備受共匪摧殘，損失綦重，據統計，自共匪倡亂以來，截至卅七年一月底爲止，該愈各廠遭匪破壞情形如次：</p>
<p>石微電廠</p>
<p>該廠所屬微水及石門兩發電所，先後於卅六年四月十二日及十一月十日爲共匪佔據，石門發電所裝有二千瓩機一套，微水發電所裝有五千瓩機一套，微水石門間之輸電綫路及兩地之配電用戶設備全部損失，至詳細遭受破壞情形，現在設法探査中。</p>
<p>青島電廠</p>
<p>該廠張博供電區管理處博山發電所，卅六年二月失陷後，共匪本有破壞發電設備之意，經留廠之本地員工哀求，始免破壞，現已收復材料一部份，被刧掠電綫路亦有破壞。</p>
<p>東北電力廠</p>
<p>（一）松撫輸電綫路，該局豐滿水力發電廠，現有設備可發電十三萬五千瓩，占東北全部發電量約百分之六十五，其中大部份原由松撫廿二萬伏輸電綫路送至撫順，供應東北南部谷地之需要，三十六年五月，該綫被共匪破壞，損失情形甚重，且所經區域現仍多被匪佔據，無法進行修理工作，目下豐滿電力不能輸出，而南部需用電力至切，供求不能相濟，影響國計民生至鉅。</p>
<p>（二）西安支局及發電所，卅六年五月共匪發動第五次攻勢，西安至四平及西安至開原間之輸電綫路先後被匪破壞，至六月二日，城郊激戰，發電所中彈七八十枚，水塔及三部鍋爐與一座汽輪發電機之調速器均受彈傷，六千伏安變壓器亦被毁三台，六月三日發電所及支局被陷，尙未收復。</p>
<p>（三）安東支局，安東於卅五年底共匪退去後，由該局派員前往接辦該處電力事業，共　潰退時，安東一次變電所三七。五〇〇千伏安主要變壓器三具及其他設備與房屋等，均遭澈底破壞，不能修復。又四道溝六及道溝之二次變電所之變壓器設節及房屋等，所受破壞情形亦極嚴重，該支局接收後，即予整理，並積極進行恢復，迄至三十六年六月初，又再度撤退。</p>
<p>（四）四平支局，三十六年六月廿一日被共匪侵據，於同年八月爲國軍收復，該支局廠舍全部被毁；材料亦大部被刦，配電綫路損失十分之七，員工殉職一名，傷二名，失踪二十一名。</p>
<p>北票發電所，該所於三十六年六月卅日被共匪佔據，該所警衛隊及員工一部均曾參加保衛戰，有工人三名殉職，至爲壯烈，綫路等亦有損壞，三十六年十一月收復，今年一月又吿失陷。</p>
<p>冀北電力公司</p>
<p>該公司津唐輸電綫路，自三十六年二月廿日起至十二月十二日，先後被共匪破壞六次，共損失電桿六百四十四檔，綫路總長達廿八公里七百公尺。</p>
<p>又變電站方面有（一）漢沽變電站，六月十七日夜被匪軍攻入，變壓器一合被毀，二臺損傷，九月廿九日晨該站又被匪軍攻陷，變壓器一合被擊毀，另一合變壓器磁頭玻璃被擊碎。（二）昌黎變電站，五月十八日被匪軍全部焚燬。</p>
<p>海南電廠　海南電廠東方水力發電所，原有發電容量五千瓩，輸電綫路長約九十餘公里，以該所與感恩縣北黎市尙距四十里之遙，地位偏僻，交通不便，致共匪出沒無常，員工時遭擄刦，設備屢受破壞，自卅五年八月後，計該所對外輸電綫路遭受破壞盜賣，屢豐屢修者，不下廿餘次，各次合計被毀綫路共達五十餘公里，電桿四百餘株，損失綦重，修復爲難，卅六年度所以所存綫路器材業已川罄，無力添購，且共匪破壞鐵路更形變本加厲，對外供電已無法繼續維持，經已部份拆卸保管，此項不得已之措施，對於海南工業之發展，影響甚鉅。</p>

<p>（上接一版）該文件中稱：在貨物需要之差額上中國可自諸如加拿大與英　集團地區方而獲得。美國務院認爲，中國經濟之迅速退化，係由於內戰而致在物資，幣制及財政方面發生影響，物資方面之影響，包括交通運輸與工業設備之破壞與脫節、原料糧食及燃料來源之斷絕。財政與幣制方面之影響則爲通貨膨脹，致使一九四六年每月鈔票發行率自百分之十增至目前之百分之廿五，面致政府預算需要中國法幣四小萬億元，而其供軍事用途者，達百分之七十，致使中國輸出與正式收人之繼續續低落，以及外匯來源之益形低落，此項方案如吿實施，將可給予中國外匯收入方面之稍微剩餘，預期此將作爲改進貨幣準備金以及作爲採購重要軍事供應品之用（一如馬歇爾今日所報吿者），據國務院估計，自一九四八年四月一日至一九四九年六月三上日止，除援華方案下所供應者外，中國在獲得重要輸入品方面，將化費之美元外匯爲五千五百萬美元（爲輸入化學品，染料，紙類，木漿，木材，橡皮及橡皮物品等等），另加政府所化費之美元外匯七千五百萬美元（貸款之付息，駐外使節人員之用費等），總數一億三千萬美元。另一方面，中國政府之美元外匯收入，據估計在一億二千五百萬至一億八千五百萬美元之間（來自輸出僑匯外國政府及慈善機關之開支以及剩餘財產之出售），據該項文件宣布，本年一月一日中國政府所握有之外匯，計有美國通貨或黄金二億三千四百萬美元，英鎊通貨四千萬美元，共計二億七千四百萬美元，此外，中國尙握有價値三千萬美元之白銀，據估計，私人所握有之黄金。外匯及長期資產，至少爲五億美元。據國務院統計，美國在對日本勝利日以前，在各種形式下攢助中國者，計達十四億六于九百四十萬美元，自對日本勝利日以來，援助中國者，達十四億零九百萬美元。另一方面，自對日本勝利日以來，經中國政府所化費之外匯，計達七億餘美元。按我行政院長張羣一月廿八日所發表之財政，經濟十點改革方案，亦爲該文件中附錄之一。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿日電〕廿日美衆院外委會中，大部份之質詢時間，係用於討論中國之軍事需要。衆議員周以德（明尼蘇　州共和黨議員）救促擴大對中國之軍事援助，並派一軍事顧問代表團赴華。馬歇爾指出，在渠以杜魯門總統特使資格逗留於中國之時期中，曾不斷向中國政府提供意見，即如何改善其作戰兵力。渠力言，在將此等軍隊編入作戰師國之前，應予充份訓練之重要性。</p>
<p>國務卿宣稱：「關於意見之提供並未缺少，而曾不斷並努力加以提出者—惟被忽視」。</p>
<p>或間援華計劃是否爲歐洲復興計劃之修正案，馬歇爾稱：「否，此爲美國必須面臨之重要情形，而同時歡洲復興計劃則本身爲一整個之單位。當考慮歐洲復興計劃之時，吾人係對付一種情形，當考慮援華計劃時，吾人係對付另一完全不同之情形」。</p>
<p>馬歇爾稱：歐洲各國有一健全之基礎，可資建議，但中國之情形則混亂不堪，甚至無人能預言將來之情形。</p>
<p>共和黨衆議員門特稱：國務院應有一「堅强」之外交，以配合援華與援歐問題，國務卿支持此一主張，並稱：國務院之主要目標爲「個人之若干自由」。</p>
<p>渠繼稱：「余不以爲吾人靜立不動，余以爲吾人正向前邁進」。</p>
<p>史密斯問：國務卿是否以為委員會應硏究魏德邁之援華報吿，國務卿答稱，「否」。渠對於有人提議由東京召回盟國駐日統帥麥克阿瑟元帥，以便出席委員會作證一事，不願表示意見若干委員則似乎贊成此項主張。或問：渠以爲中國國民政府應制定何稱改革，馬歇爾答稱：渠相信中國政府之基礎必須加以擴大，而不應以一小集團爲限。尤其余以爲國民政府對於土地情形，農民問題，應採取行動，在下層階級中展開一種感想，以爲政府對於彼等或彼等之問題，置之不顧」。</p>
<p>渠稱：中國之軍事材料，對於軍事組織遠不及領袖才能素質與民氣之　要。</p>
<p>共和黨衆議員洛奇問：關於日本賠償問題，是否宜舉行一次新會議，國務卿稱：目下之協議因可能妨碍整個問題之解決，故應予以重新考慮。</p>
<p>國務卿指出，中國之情形，在若于時候曾引起關切，一九四六年八月　，渠曾建議美國進出口銀行硏對華建設貸款之可能性。馬歇爾又稱：一但當時中國之情形如此，致使該行認爲不能貸款」。</p>
<p>衆議員基氏（西浮琴尼亞州民主黨議員）詢問，目前考慮中之援助能否「達到中國人民良以此項援助係給予中國人民者」。國務卿答稱：「渠以爲可以達到，吾人能在合理之程度希望計劃獲得實施，商品可以達到所擬給予之人民」。</p>
<p>國務卿稱：過去對中國政府供給武器方面之種種遷延，其中許多次係由於中國當局遲遲未　作種種安排。</p>
<p>衆議員伏里斯（俄亥俄州共和黨議員）指出，國會現有一種感覺，即對華有所作爲，或屬過早或已過遲。</p>
<p>馬歇爾答稱：「依余所見，在我國之援助能成爲有效前，該方面有若千基本工作必須做到。就此一意義言之，援助尙屬過早。另一方面，該方面之情形在迅速衰落中，吾人必須考慮如不浪費資金吾人不能有所成就之可能性』。國務卿稱：有許多事情中國政府可以做到，而未曾做到，此即在政治方而滿足人民，在軍事方面不僅響應吾國高級軍略家之意見，抑且響應彼等自己之高級長官之意見。　伏甲斯詢問希臘與中國局勢之間是否可等量齊觀，馬歇爾答稱；局勢甚爲不同。渠說明，在中國，「吾有一已與政府作戰相當時間之軍隊，在希臘，吾人有一正由鄰邦支持之侵略勢力，共產黨軍隊自中國之外獲得援助一點，並無證據」。</p>
<p>國務卿對衆議員史密斯（威斯康辛州共和黨議員）所稱中國局勢可以危害美國之國家安全一點，意見相符。馬歇爾稱：國務院希望一穩定之中國能吿建立，但此點牽涉尙須加以形成之軍事，政治與經濟因素。</p>
<p>馬歇爾對史密斯所稱中國東北已爲共產黨所獲得之意見，不表同意，渠稱：渠不希望造成一種印象，即國民政府軍隊將突然轉變對共產黨軍隊之局勢，但表示渠並不相信東北之局勢有如某些人所描寫之危急。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京廿一日電〕日本保守派民主黨總裁蘆田均，廿一日下午當選日本戰後第五位首相。蘆田頃稱：擬於廿三日組織中問性聯合內閣，蘆田今年六十歲，原任片山內閣外相，預料麥齣將贊成其執政。衆院席次共有四百廿一席，蘆田二百十六票當選。缺任首相片山誓宣佈無意競選，其社會民主黨最後乃轉而擁護蘆田。蘆田政敵自由黨魁前首相吉田茂得一百八十票。片山得八票，共黨德田三票，另有廢票十四票。參院投票兩次吉田均佔優勢，然未達必需之半數，惟衆院之表法具有決定性，故預料參院將於廿一日晚或廿二日採取一致之行動。蘆田事後發表聲明稱：將於廿三日邀集各黨領袖，以共商政策協定，在內閣組織就緒前，渠不擬謁日皇舉行授職禮。由於蘆田對社民黨依賴頗深，故預料新內閣與上屆內閣無甚差異。政治觀察家業已預料經濟要職，已內定由社民黨出任，由於社民黨左翼份子出乎意料之外支持置田，故傳左翼社民黨員加藤將出任勞工部長。誠若是，則新內閣幾與上屆內閣全然雷同，均由社民黨操縱大權，所不同者，首相為民主黨人而已。蘆田在帝國法政大學求學時，與片山有同窗之誼，戰前曾任英文「日本履知時報」社長，英法語流利可聽，而片山則自愧不如。蘆田又曾任京都區議員，又曾奉命駐土耳其及比利時，傳盟總對渠印象甚佳。置田任外相時，會因宣佈希望召開和會時冲繩鳥及隣近日本諸島能由日本收回而引起軒然大波。然其後渠辯稱：此乃傳聞之誤。蘆田最近大受政敵指摘，謂渠在戰前爲日本廣知時報撰文爲侵略張，故應受整肅。僉以爲新內閣前途艱苦，蓋通貨膨脹，物資缺乏，兼以其他經濟問題，片山因之去職，蘆田必將大感躊躇。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿一日電〕民主黨總裁蘆田於衆議院被指名爲下屆首相後，與新開記者團首次會見，談稱；「余不肖於本日之衆議院全體會議中得被選爲內閣首相，實不勝感激。余雖力微，然將以塲誠爲國家服務，現擬於下週拜訪各黨黨首，請求協力，並就政策加以協議，至其日期果在下週何日，則尙未決定，現暫不願多述余之意見，惟願在國民之協力風援助下，突破目前之危機。」</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿一日電〕衆議院議長松岡及參議院副議長本日夜代表國會入宮報告日皇，業經指名蘆田爲下屆內閣首相，並以文書通知衆參兩院。因此蘆田業已確定爲總理大臣，惟蘆田之日皇親任式，預定俟各大臣決定後與認證式同時行之。蘆田首相自下星期一起，以民主然本部爲組閣本部，預定以四黨聯合爲根本方針，召開自由。社會。囀協三黨首與政策協定會議，先求政策之一致，而後銓衡閣僚之人選。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕美國重建日本經濟，拯救該國免於破產之計劃，已使盟國在太平洋方面之戰後共同陣綫發生緊張。美國希望日本商業恢復並自給自足，其他盟國不以爲然，若干國認爲日本倘在世界市塲重行强盛，將威脅太平洋其他各國之經濟，亦有認爲日本重行工業化之後，又將踏上黷武之路，危害世界和平，菲律濱與澳洲均抱此見解，中國亦被認爲抱此意見。</p>
<p>及至本月中旬，王外長始發表聲明，意見更與美國接近。但中國朝野其他方面則拒絕接受此種新立塲，西南太平洋方而，以美國袒護日本，亦表示不安。馬來聯邦。新加坡與荷印對日軍鐵蹄之創痛，尙未忘却。新近獨立之緬甸與英國自治領巴基斯坦與印度，可謂見解從同。凡此各國之意見，與美國之財政援日，愈來愈甚。東京所傳美國擬在四年內實行十億元援助日本計劃，此間尙未完全證實，但可能有此發展。美國佔領日本以來，每年化費在三億元以上，商業貸款亦正開始，美國陸軍部正爲日本另闢財源。國會正考慮一億五千萬元之美棉運日法案。聯邦供應局本年度將在日本化去二億八千五百萬元，下年度似將化三億六千萬元，陸軍部並希望訂立物物交換辦法。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿一日電〕據悉，根據目前在草擬中之政策，日本政府需要外國之借款及投資，但希望無「投機」之金錢。關於處理此事之基本政策，已由日本經濟穩定局勢之貿易及外國借款委員會硏究中。現在日本之盟國商人及可能投資者，正在密切注視此事之最後發展，據日本方面消息稱：「具體化政策」即將予以採取，其中要點如下：（一）投機性之投資應拒絕之；（二）投資應佐以原料之進口；（三）進口之原料無關經濟復興應予以限制；（四）宗敎，文化及遊歷之事業及硏究所應儘量鼓勵。日本政府官員相信，外匯之匯兌將暫時予以管制，蓋商業及借款仍在管制中，僉信關於此事於對日和約簽訂後將改變。按目前之管制事實乃由盟軍盺規定者。日本人現正在硏究如何管制外匯，若日本政府命令可如此爲之。</p>

<p>— 本報駐歐記者中西</p>
<p>自去冬倫敦四外長會議毫無結果不歡而散後，美國務卿馬歇爾返抵華府即積極敦促國會，希望不折不扣的從速通過其援歐計劃。英國外相貝文一月間表示決放棄工黨一向主張的構通美蘇的橋樑外交，毅然提出西歡聯盟計劃。法外長皮杜爾返國後，帮助政府整飭內部，把　動法國大罷工的外國嫌疑份子，一律勒令押解出境。莫洛托夫返蘇聯後，除提出减少對奧賠償要求，似欲與美英法三國重開談判外，近又訓令蘇司令長官在柏林盟管委會議席上，公開斥責美方苛待蘇軍士兵，同時復向美國務院提出連珠砲式之抗議書。第一個說美國不應利用的黎彼里的曼拉哈機塲；第二個說美海軍不應逗留義大利海港，指此舉爲違反對義和約；第三個說美空軍不應在日本海與黄海的蘇艦上空盤旋翱翔，偵察窺探；第四個說美國電事人員不應該協助伊朗政府建築北部邊防·美方對蘇所有抗議，已一一予以駁斥，否認有任何不當行爲。</p>
<p>以上種種，吿訴我們，東方與西方國家間鴻溝日深。分界益顯。</p>
<p>據記者的觀察，蘇聯的策略，在力求不戰而勝，運用釜底抽薪與單刀直入等方法雙管齊下，其目的當然在與美國爭取覇權。蘇聯的抗議，現實的作用在先聲奪人，表示蘇聯並不畏懼美國，但究其實際，其眞正的作用乃在造就蘇聯本國人民對美國的同仇敵愾心理，培植日後為蘇軍行動　後盾。從　駡美國抗議美國這）點上　，可言蘇美間的和平，仍還可以暫安一時，不過情勢不能否認雙方均在備，而從此又更接近於戰爭一步了。</p>
<p>說到西歐聯盟，首創在議者乃英前任首相邱吉爾。英工黨秉政後，原不願採行邱吉爾政策，即至今英國工黨仍反對由邱吉爾領導之西歐聯邦運動。但去冬四外長會議失敗後，迫于現實，英工黨外相亦因勢之所趨，不得不採用此策。最近並中英國務大臣麥克尼爾親赴比京，遊說比利時荷蘭及盧森堡三國外相，希望各國自動犧牲利權，參加此一聯盟，以免再爲任何極權國家所奴役。聞比荷盧對於貝文建議雖表贊同，但仍持保留態度，要求英法先示計劃詳細內容，同時並希望對英法管制之西德部份，三國能有過問地位。北覆方面，瑞典已正式表示不能加入，但願繼續保持中立。丹麥亦想追隨瑞典立塲，表示超然。瑞士無所表示，或仍保守中立。義大利如其國內共黨不能　勢，大半可望加入，一切仍將以英法間合作之程度如何爲成功前提。目前進行西歐聯盟之國家與　接受馬歇爾援歐計劃之國家，其數量爲一與三之比例，照擬加入西歐聯盟者現僅五六國，而　接受馬歇爾援歐計劃者則已有十六國。默察之勢，西歐各國間之政治組合，將較其抓濟合作難十百倍，且貝文外相之西歐聯盟計劃，縱能推行，其進度必極遲緩，能否眞正達到至阻止蘇聯西進之目的，仍屬疑問，因西歐各國語文互異，傳統不同，欲其立即水乳交融，自非易之事。惟觀其過去歷史，彼此雖不易於共安樂，然每多能共患難，且獨立自主之精神極爲堅强，故强國縱能遽予兼併，但亦甚難予以消化也。（卅七年二月七日）</p>

<p>稱我總司令不要稱我總統</p>
<p>在戰爭發生之後，我國的武裝部隊在總統以總司令資格指揮之下，開到前綫去，但是外交工作也成爲戰爭中的一個重要因素。對敵國的關係固然已經停止了，但是對盟國和中立國的關係，却愈形複雜，使我們的工作大爲繁重。</p>
<p>在和平時代，國務院是負責處理國際關係的，此外並就我國國外軍隊的調動問題，提供意見，例如我國駐華軍隊應予增加或减少等。當戰爭來臨之時，國務院不再和國外的軍事行動發生關係，因爲它已僅屬於適當軍事當局指揮的範圍之內了。</p>
<p>幾乎在珍珠港事件一變生之後，我就對我的同事說，從今以後，國務院的任務乃在對戰爭努力有所貢獻，表希望國務院中每一個人和陸軍部海軍部和一切與戰爭有關機關充份合作，並給予一切便利。</p>
<p>我不准國務院中的官員到我那裏來說陸軍部或者海軍部的某一官員做錯了事，已經成爲慣例。我對他們說，「記着，他們是負責戰略和執行戰爭的人。他們有權獲得我們最充份的合作。」</p>
<p>在珍珠港事件之前，我是軍事會議中一員，其中包括總統，國務卿，陸軍部長，海軍部長，參謀總長和海軍作戰部長，我參與各次會議。在珍珠港事件之後，我不再出席有關軍事問題的會議了。這是因爲總統並未邀我出席這些會議之故。我好幾次向他提出這個問題。在我看來，在許多重要方面，國務卿應該出席總統的軍事會議，特別是有關軍事外交聯合性質的會議，理由頗爲明顯，因爲極少大規模的軍事行動不牽涉到外交方面的。</p>
<p>我覺得國務卿不出席重要的軍事會議，乃是一種重大的錯誤。我時常有機會向總統指出一點，就是無疑在這些會鑽中決定的某種軍事性質發展，亦有其重大的外交關係，當時我應該獲得通知。</p>
<p>總統沒有帶我去出席卡薩勃朗加，開羅，或者德黑蘭會議，這些會議主要是屬於軍事性質的。我也沒有參加他和邱吉爾首相在華盛頓舉行的軍事討論，其中一部份對於外交方而曾有廣泛的影響。我對他說：「我並不是想增加自己的責任，但是我相信國務卿是應該出席這些會議的。」我提起英國的辦法，就是艾登外相是參加一切軍事會議的。　總統的答覆乃是我們這裏有一種不同的制度　這點我同意是事實英國的內閣形成政府，艾登在他們的制度之下應較我在我們的制度之下具有更强的理由去參加軍事會議，縱使外交的各方面也是値得考慮的重要因素。</p>
<p>我從總統以外的其他方面獲悉卡薩勃朗加，開羅和德黑蘭會議中所發生的事情。我沒有特殊的機會可以向羅斯福先生詢問有關這些會議的發展，但是假如我詢問他有關他所討論的問題，那麽除了少數例外之外，他總是馬上會坦白地吿訴我最機密的事情的。</p>
<p>有一個軍事性質的問題我曾和總統及其軍事方面的助手討論過，那就是關於第二戰綫的地點。我同意我們主要的努力應該是横渡英吉利海峽到法國去。至於軍隊將在何處登陸以及在征服希特勒的大軍事行動中眾除將由什麼路綫横越大陸的問題，我却從來沒有和總統或者其他高級軍事官員中的任何人討論過，雖然我早就獲悉業已獲致的決定。　關於原子炸彈，並沒有人吿訴過我。偶然，某一個人給我一個隱約的暗示，但是我並不迫着提出問）題。我並不眞正知道它，直到它投了下來並且加以宣佈之後。在它在準備之中的最後幾個月中以及在投下的時候，我已不再是國務卿，所以我是不會知道什麽的了。羅斯福先生高瞻遠矚，決定費去二十億美元來發展原子炸彈，的確値得讚揚。</p>
<p>總統繼續不請我去參加他的軍事會議。他愛好大局軍事的一面，歡喜把它掌握在自己的手小。在珍珠港事件之後，他喜歡被人家稱爲總司令，比總統的名稱爲甚。他樂於用這個銜頭。他可能覺得這個極重要的地位現在是比總統都更屬必要。</p>
<p>在一次內閣的宴會上，大約在一九四二年，我準備舉觴致意。在我起立發言之前，總統要求我：</p>
<p>「請你稱呼我總司令，不要稱呼我總統。」</p>
<p>在我和各國大使，尤其是我們主要盟國代表談話的時候，不提及若干軍事題目當然是不可能的。一九四一年十二月，當我和蘇聯新大使李維諾夫作第一次談話時，我提出一個問題，要求蘇聯准許我們使用蘇聯領土上的空軍根據地，以便轟炸日本　區。我們也討論到用蘇聯船隻載運供應品到海參崴去的問題，丙爲日本顯然是不會准許美國船隻載運它們到蘇聯去的。</p>
<p>李維諾夫是蘇聯前外長，以前我曾和仙進行過初步的談判，結果在一九三三年建立了美蘇外交關係。　三天之後，當李維諾夫徇我之請來看我時，他說他的政府已通知他認爲它在當時不能和我們合作反抗日本。他說蘇聯正在進行反抗德國的大規模戰爭，不能冒　進攻日本。</p>
<p>我回答說我能够理解蘇聯的立塲。我向他提起在這一年之初我們曾供給蘇聯有關德國即將向它進攻的警吿，並且說我現在有同樣可靠的情形，那就是日本不管日蘇中立條約的規定，對德國負有最嚴格的義務，在希特勒要求的時候，它就會進攻蘇聯以及對德作戰的任何其他國家。我還說，辦法彷彿是如此的：日本將先攻擊美國，由德國和義大利參加，其後，當德國要求的時候，日本將侵犯蘇聯。</p>
<p>雖然史達林早在那時候決定暫不參加我們反抗日本，我還是把這個間題放在他的面前有相當時候。</p>
<p>在戰爭爆發之後，國務院的工作在許多方而發生了變化或者加緊了。</p>
<p>爲了和軸心國交換外交人員和平民，我們也在從事談判，消費了好幾個月的時間。在珍珠港事件之後幾天，當國務院就此一問題正在舉行會議的時候，我們從一個極可靠方面得到一個消息，說日本大使野村和他的海軍參贊已經接到命令，應該在大使館中實行切腹，因此日本政府可以說我們暗殺他們的。</p>
<p>假如這個計劃實現了，我們在日本　官吏究竟將怎樣使我們非常担心。我們　請瑞士公使立即到日本大使館去，把我們已經接到的消息通知野村，並且要斷定他的意向。他們談了很久，但是並不能使我們　恐懼完全消釋，因爲野村說決定並不在他，而在高級當局。</p>

<p>於國防技術員工緩召問題，各業工人大都認爲持有社會部勞動局所頒之技術員工登記證，即可緩召。國防部認爲對象範圍，過於廣泛，近發表關於緩召之限制四點，由社會部令本市社會局飭總工會轉各業工會，遵照辦理。其四條件爲：（一）本身資格是否與關國防工業專門技術員工緩召適用範圍第一項第一二兩款所定者符合。（二）現在所從事之工作，是否在同範圍第三項至第十一項所列舉之部門內，或經本部特准，比照上項規定辦理者。（三）所服務之廠或處所，是否合於同範圍第十二至十四項之規定，經設權註册核准有案，以及動力設施員工人數，均符法定者。（四）其主管機關，是否依照申請審査辦法第九條之規定，除發給服任技術職務證書或技工檢定書外，並造具名册，於當地團管區司令部予以證明者。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據某有資格之人士談：本市今年征兵，可能依法抽籤征召。此由中央對於本市今年配額六千人較去年增加一倍，可以預測。該氏未說明此項預測之理由，僅謂國民有服兵役之義務，中央現在各地積極推進役政，成績尙稱滿意，上海雖爲工商區域，以四百萬之人口，配額六千名，爲數無多，依法征召，必可輕易從事。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市定於廿九日舉行之兵役會議，有關方面將於日內電請國防部兵役局長徐思平來滬指導。</p>

<h3 id="c72">對縣市財政監督辦法案　參議會電立院籲請廢止　根據政院覆函列述理由 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>市參議會前准市府公函，轉奉行政院令頭「縣市參議會在地方自治未完成前，對縣市財政監督辦法」一案，認爲是項辦法與（一）現行參議會組織條例牴觸，（二）係以命令變更法律，（三）削减地方民意機關職權，（四）有違憲法精神，經電呈行政院請予收回成命，明令廢止，並分電各省市參議會一致響應。茲已陸續接到雲南，湖北，湖南，廣西，河南，江西，察哈爾等省參議會來電表示贊同，一致主張廢止。並接准行政院秘書處公函轉復，惟行政院復函僅就原電第一點作抽象之答復，對於第二·三·四點，則避不答示，該會仍認爲未能滿意，難以接受。</p>
<p>爲維護憲法情神以崇法治起見，爰經根據函復各節，衡以法理，列述理由，由議長交本次大會公決，以便再電行政院並通電全國省市參議會一致主張，同時另電立法院請予重視立法程序，不容行政機構任意以命令變更法律，務期籲請中樞收回成命明令廢止是項辦法而後已。茲探錄該案所述理由要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）政院引用「縣各級組織綱要」，而該綱要係遠在民國廿八年九月頒布，於卅四年一月復有現行市參議會組織條例之公佈，依後方優於前法之法理，自應遵循現行組織條例賦予之權利而無疑。（二）根據現行組織條例第二·三·廿二條等條文之規定，如能切付實施，對於地方行政機關與民意機構之職權劃分詳縝，儘可妥善運用，復函所稱「於過渡時期作適當之規定」一節，實無必要。（三）復函末引用「訓政結束程序法」第五條，該條文明定現有民意機構行使原有之法定職權，應於依憲法選舉或改組完成之日即行停止，是則所設「法定職權」，自係指經正式立法程序訂定之現行組織條例賦予之職權，而決非指以命令變更法律之政院之監督辦法而言，此理更爲明顯云。</p>
<p>上海市選舉委員會，於昨日下午四時在市府會議室舉行結束會議，出席吳國楨·陳寳泰·王嵐僧等委員，及選舉事務所各高級職員。由吳主委國楨主持，經作三項決議如下：（一）上海市選舉事務所定於二月廿八日結束，三月一日起正式撤銷。（二）選所中調用之職員一律歸回原處辦公。（二）選所中之雇員，成績優良者，分別由各局處繼續延任。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紅舞女「洋囡囡李珍與沈鞏偉之桃色糾紛，被沈妻毛秀珍控吿妨害家庭罪，又因沈身中私藏無照手槍一枝，經檢察官依通姦罪與公共危險罪提起公訴，案送地院刑庭審理。昨晨上午九時許，周世泰推事在地院刑三庭首度開庭訊問，市民震於李珍之艷名，爭欲一覩此紅舞女之廬山眞面目，旁聽席上遂有人滿之患。</p>
<p>妨害家庭　附帶民訴</p>
<p>李到庭時艷裝濃抹，着紅錄小圈相間之綢旗袍，外翠灰背大衣，圍淡綠羊毛圍巾，玻璃絲襪，玄色麂皮高跟鞋。沈妻毛秀珍着花綢旗袍，外罩黄狼皮大衣，圍粉紅羊毛圍巾，足登紫紅麂皮高跟鞋。沈鞏偉着藏靑色麥爾登呢長衫，髮作鬈狀。毛除控吿妨害家庭罪外，幷附帶民訴，請判令兩被吿返還前被脅迫詐欺取去之首飾，計赤金十兩，五兩重赤金鐲二副，三兩重鎖片及金鏈一副，三克拉鑽戒一枚，四克拉翡翠鑽戒一枚，兩克拉半紅寳鑽圈一副，美鈔二十元四張，十元四張，至十時半訊畢，庭諭改期續審。沈偉鞏稱病要求交保，庭上未准，仍予還押。</p>
<p>態度大變　通宵不歸</p>
<p>毛秀珍供：與沈結婚已有三年，初尙融洽，迨沈與李珍相識後，態度大變，甚至通宵不歸，嗣經友人密報，始知彼與李珍相暱，大晚報刊有合攝照片，獲有通姦證據。上月二十日晚，得悉兩被吿竟大胆宿於家中，乃即報警捉姦，叩房門時，由沈開門，李珍仍臥於牀上，李珍當時幷無酒醉狀態。至於沈與李珍同居於愚園路，則不知道。</p>
<p>結為姊妹　看牢一人</p>
<p>李珍供：職業舞女，與沈鞏偉相識二年，由毛秀珍之弟毛宗書介紹，我倆感情甚好，沈常來我處叙談，幷未周居，愚園路一一一二弄四號之屋，係我所租。去年七月間某夜，與沈·毛同在雪園吃夜飯時，毛曾對我稱，與其夫相愛，本無問題，祗要我倆結爲姊妹，兩人看牢一人，不許其再荒唐即成。此後，我即與沈發生關係，沈亦常到我處宿夜，此事經過係獲毛之同意，沈鞏偉幷無首飾錢鈔交給我，我倆出去白相，均由我付錢。一月二十日晚因酒醉被沈邀往渠家中住宿，經過情形，已不能記憶。</p>
<p>無照手槍　友人所贈</p>
<p>沈鞏偉供稱：自去年八月二日起即與李珍同居，迄未返家，對家庭尙無不滿意之處，與李珍相暱，毛秀珍是知道的，且於去年大約六月半，在雪園同桌吃過飯，一月二十日我與李珍均已酒醉，相偕返寓後，並無他事，僅等候姆媽回來。無照手槍係友人所贈，因去年曾遇盜刦，適友人以手搶相贈，乃收下佩用，正欲設法領照，不圖即被警抄獲。</p>
<p>至此，周推事訊問毛秀珍有無在雪園同桌吃飯之事，毛立即否認，被吿延請之辯護律師請求州傳訊雪園侍者到庭作證。</p>

<h3 id="c99">世界茶產供不應求　我去年輸出量增加　壽景偉勉茶商把握時機 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>我國茶業向佔出口貿易重要地位，惟戰後因物價動盪，成本日增，出口價格，又礙於外匯市價與黑市相距過遠，出口異常困難。但國內茶業界處此艱困異常之環境中，爲協助政府發展外銷，爭取外匯起見，仍在努力支撑中。中央社記者爲明瞭卅六年度我國茶業外銷情形起見，特訪中國茶業協會理事長壽景偉氏，承其縷述去年一年來茶葉出口貿易，世界茶葉市况，與本年度我國茶業瞻望如次：</p>
<p>一年來的出口貿易：我國茶葉出口量，在一九一五年廿世紀初，全盛時期達一百萬公担之多，一九三四—三八年間尙達四十萬公祖，而一九四六年出口量僅六萬九千公担，短短卅餘年間，其衰减程度至足驚人。</p>
<p>輸出數量：根據去年海關總稅務署，統計科出版之中國進出口貿易統計月刋十一月號，統計一至十一月爲止，計輸出紅茶四三·七七四公担，綠茶七九·二四〇公担，磚茶六八七公担，其他茶九二三六公担，總計出口一三二·九三七公祖。與卅五年同期輸出五二·六二七公担，已增加百分之六十，似乎稍有起色。</p>
<p>（甲）輸出港別：三十五年一—十一月，出口總量五二，六二七公担小，上海輸出三七，三七〇公担，福州一〇，〇三七公祖，廣州一，一七八公担，台灣出口僅一七五公担，其他三八六七公担。而三十六年上海輸出計七〇，一〇六公担，福州七，七八四公担，廣州六，五四六公担，台灣出口量則激增至四〇，八六三公担。其他港口爲七，六三八公担。由上列數字，可知我國內地茶葉出口量，除台灣外，三十五年一—十一月，計五二，四五二公担，三十六年同期則爲九二，〇七四公担，增加四萬公担。其中大部均爲陳茶，新茶因受匯率影響，碍於國外市價，成倒掛之勢，仍難順利出口。合灣茶葉因過去有良好產製基礎，產量恢復較速，國際聲譽久著，品質劃一標準化，合乎市塲需要。故去年出口量，如連十二月份計算在內，司達一千萬磅，已恢復戰前盛時百分之五十。</p>
<p>（乙）出口茶類：出口茶葉中，紅茶佔四三，七七四公担。綠茶七九，二四〇公担，綠茶中除台灣包種錄茶一二，六六六公担，珠茶五，一七三公担，熙春一，一六六公担，雨前一，一八〇公担，毛茶三，八四六公担外，其餘五五，二〇九公担中，屯綠眉茶爲大部，佔總出口量百分之四十一，均較祁紅平錄爲多，所以今後屯綠大有發展擴大輸出之希望。</p>
<p>（丙）戰往國別：戰前我國茶葉年銷蘇聯，紅綠磚茶及其他茶葉十五萬公担，北菲摩洛哥阿爾及爾年銷綠茶（平綠爲主）十萬公担，其他銷英美歐洲各國紅綠茶，亦在十萬公担以上。去年一—十一月輸出數字中，香港佔首位，計三七，七七六公祖，美國次之，一五，五六九公担，英國第三，爲六，六四〇公祖。其次伊朋，埃及各銷五六千公担，最次爲加拿大及法國，各一千七八百公祖，而蘇聯僅八公担。上列數字中，香港雖佔首位，但大部均轉口運銷他國，北菲摩洛哥阿爾及爾等地，海關統計月報並未列舉，諒併入其他各國項內。至於蘇聯三十五年因政府以美金償債未採易貨辦法，大部茶葉經印度轉口輸蘇，三十六年十二月中央信託局，以三十五年度收購茶葉辦理對蘇易貨，業已成交三〇，九六一箱，計二百餘萬磅，合九千七百餘公祖，內紅茶二，四四〇公祖，綠茶七，二六〇公担，將於日內運蘇。</p>
<p>世界茶產概况：第二次世界大戰後，主要茶產國如日本·荷印·合灣·中國。等地，因受戰爭影響，茶廠被毁，茶園荒蕪，或改種食糧作物，產量大减，尤以荷印爲甚，根據當地通訊，目前雖有少數茶廠正作復興活動，但因機械人員缺乏，產量極微，商業上受荷蘭政府管制，僅若千荷商在政府監督下做少量賣買，而茶葉品質低券，遠不如戰前水準。日本茶業，根據美國「茶與咖啡』葉誌九十　號報導，日本茶葉在戰時確受極大打擊，產量較戰前幾减少百分之九十，但日政府在美軍總部管轄之下，設立國外貿易部，處理茶葉出口事宜，一九四六年輸美七百萬磅，且自一九四七年起實施五年計劃，每年增闢茶國七三五二畝，產量可達五七，八七〇，四〇〇磅，及戰前產量一一四，四〇七百萬磅的百分之五十，由此可見生產恢復之神速。</p>
<p>預計日本五年計劃實施之後，茶產至少可增兩倍，台灣茶葉目前經政府獎助，又因基礎良好，在一九四七年產量已較一九四六年有顯者增加，如政府於輸出方面能予茶商以便利，出口量及產量均不難恢復戰前數量，</p>
<p>此外，印度錫蘭及英屬東菲，因戰時政府實行收購政策，不但毫無缺少，反而增加。如印度一九三五—三九年，四二四百萬磅增至五六二百萬磅，錫蘭約增五千萬磅，東菲增七百萬磅，但估計一九四七—四八年茶產總量，約在九〇二—九〇六百萬磅之間，尙不及戰前九八三百萬磅之多。</p>
<p>提高品質　獎勵外銷</p>
<p>我國茶葉瞻望：本年吾人應切實把握世界茶產供不應求不可多得之機緣。同時商品檢驗所對於茶葉之嚴格檢驗，以及茶商同業對於茶葉品質之提高，應特加注意。至於劣質茶葉　入高價茶葉，尤應痛誡。除在台灣作進一步積極獎勵土產與國內茶葉相互配合，對外推銷，及繼續舉辦茶貸外，對於外匯調整及進口連鎖應作有建設性的新措施。茶葉協會諸理監事日前開會商討今年茶貸辦法，擬請援照去年絲繭貸款方案，規定每担茶葉平均價格以交換食米兩担半至三担爲標準，貸款墊頭擬以一成爲度，至貸款總額現在亦甚難確定，如能仍由中國農民銀行負責經放，並員保證責任，庶幾推動全國茶業可自更進一步之發展云。</p>

<p>〔本報西安十七日航訊〕「敦煌」這地名對我們不會生疏，其試　四十里莫高窟的佛經佛像，我們亦久仰其名，惜乎不容易看到眞跡。遠走河西跨過沙漠地帶去實地巡瞪當然不易，甚至複製品模寫品印刷品和照片之類的欣賞機會，也不會多有。在其先，我們看過斯坦因，伯希和，張大千，鄭振鐸……等輩介紹和傳播的一些敦煌藝術品，而今年新春，國立西北大學的西北文物硏究室在西安首次展出了「敦煌文物展覽會」，會期一共十二天，儘管天陰下雪，泥深路爛，參觀的人天天還是那末多，一般參觀者對於展覽品，大半都能接受，其効果，遠勝於一般的個人美術展覽會。</p>
<p>鑿洞塑佛　千五百年</p>
<p>這次的展覽品類別相當週全，點數雖不多而精，閱後可使人有整個的概念。入門處的河西走廊地圖，莫高窟全景照片和王子雲（該展覽會的主持）寫生的千佛寺全景長軸，顯示了莫高窟的輪廓和規模，使觀衆先有個鳥瞰的印象。這個一千五百年前開擊的佛洞而保存至今，比大同雲崗佛窟，洛陽龍門佛窟或麥積山佛窟都老百年以上的歷史。</p>
<p>敦煌的佛經，本來保存極爲豐富，但經過外籍的考古家捷足先登的搜刧偸運，重要的差不多已蕩然無存，但在這展覽會中仍能僥倖地看到唐代左右的寫經刻經，一鱗半爪，彌足珍貴。</p>
<p>至於文字部份尙有　刻的拓片，除了藝術上的價値外，並且幫助我們了解該洞的史實。</p>
<p>雕像塑像　鬼斧神工</p>
<p>敦煌石刻和塑像，其精美處我們實在不能用文字來形容。無論體型的整體，或面顏，肌肉，衣褶的局部，我們拿現代人的眼光和水準去衡量評價，比諸希臘羅馬的古代刻像塑像，無不及或甚過之。</p>
<p>會塲中尙有四點小泥塑佛像，每像高不及十公分，佛的顏面最小者不過半公分，然五官神氣活現，精緻處堪稱「神工鬼斧！」</p>
<p>最大壁畫　高達數丈</p>
<p>壁畫有原作照片和摹模品兩種，從前者我們看到整幅的佈置和構成，從後者看到近似的原作色彩。欣賞上兩者都不能或缺。最大的一幀「經變圖」，原作高度達七公尺，圖中人物數以百計。　壁畫的題材可粗分爲這麽幾種，一種是佛像供養像，五彩設色和單色勾勒綫條的都有；一種是佛經的故事畫，圖案畫亦有相當多。</p>
<p>兩種作風　各有千秋</p>
<p>無論壁畫及石刻，其作風顯然分爲兩種：分別以北魏及唐代爲中心。前者包括東西魏，北周，北齊諸代，後渚爲隋唐五代而至宋元以後。據專家王子雲氏的解釋：」魏唐兩者之形式技巧及內容，均截然不同。前者多爲佛故事湼槃圖等，手法僅無渲染，不重勾綫，筆調豪放，大氣磅磚。鮮卑族之豪邁風格，流露無遺，雕塑則保有「　陀羅」作風，所受希臘波斯之影響，至爲濃厚。</p>
<p>「唐代作品則將外來之佛敎藝術蛻變爲東方固有之形式，而形成中國民族氣質的產物，壁畫由渲染一變爲勾綫，色彩由單純變爲富麗，內容由簡單進爲繁複，佛賓題材，更趨豐富。……」</p>
<p>天花藻井　嫓美花磚</p>
<p>屬於純圖案的以花磚及天花藻井圖案爲主。花磚是唐代建築佛洞用，莫高窟一共有廿多種花紋，每個磚的大小有三〇——三五公分正方，圖案多作輻射狀，花紋凸出磚面。　天花藻井圖案繪描於佛洞內的天花頂上，五彩富麗，爲硏究圖案者的最好材料。從作風上看，似乎受到波斯·阿拉伯的影響。</p>
<p>此外尙有若干圖案畫，具有近代作風。</p>
<p>南無觀音　卻有鬍子</p>
<p>敦煌文物，除了藝術上有無上的價値外，對於宗敎，語文，風俗，考古，服飾史，音樂史，建築史……亦有相等的重要。會塲中展出一幀觀世音菩薩像，爲一男子，具有「八」字兩撇鬍鬚，和「了」字形下頷美髯！觀衆嘖嘖稱奇，然考諸佛經記載，實屬如此。</p>
<p>東方音樂史權威之田邊尙雄，常引敦煌　賽作業器史的證據。在這展覽會的出品中，我們看到各式各樣的樂器及其演奏和合奏情况。上述「經變圖』的一角，就描繪了三十多個演奏者手持各式樂器合奏的情形，其中無論吹的，彈的，打的，拉的，和邊跳邊彈的……一一俱備，由此可想見唐代當年的樂風。此外，壁畫中的女人，髮型和衣飾，有許多和現代的不謀而合，誠不可思議。誰料一九四八年『摩登伽」之玻璃皮包和「道士髪髻」，在千年前的敦煌壁上，早已繪有圖樣？（本報記者麥葉）</p>

<p>〔中央社蘇州廿一日電〕因唐詩「姑蘇城　寒山寺，夜半鐘聲到客船」而得傳名後世之蘇州寒山寺唐代古鐘，於淸季被人竊去，運往日本。現該寺大雄寳殿與「大覺」鐘樓所懸之兩鐘，一爲日本賠償之騰物，一爲光緒卅年所鑄造之新鐘，皆非原物。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，寒山寺住持培元，根據歷年證明文件，呈請政府，向日本交涉追回原鐘，俾此歷史性之古物得以保存。該案已由盟總命令日政府，調査藏匿所在，歸還我國，寺僧正搜集有關該鐘形式重量之照片記載，以供參考。國際軍事法庭　問桂裕，與留日僧演如，亦協助徵集證據，當不難返璧還珠，使姑蘇人士重聞寒山古鐘之聲。</p>
<p>記者今特往訪該寺，由知客師覺心接談，據吿：本寺原爲「大音本寺」，額名「寒山」，建始普明（古僧名），外傳古鐘被竊，係在民國初年日人大隈伯串同竊賊，迷往日本，實則淸季光緒年間即巳被竊運日，證以日人伊藤博文所撰鐘銘云：「唐鐘轉入我邦，今失所在，山田寒山搜索甚力，而遂不能得焉，乃將新鑄一鐘，賣往懸之，明治卅八年四月，（即光緒卅一年，西歷一九零五年），」可見原鍊被竊，至遲在一九零五年以前。現日人所賠償之銅鐘，縣於寒山寺大雄寳殿內。至「大覺」鐘樓所懸之鐘，鐵質，爲光緒卅二年（一九〇六年）陳筱石制帥撫吳時所鑄，藩臬以下皆勒名其上，詳見兪曲園先生記載。關於原鐘之形式重量，「誌鐘」上記述甚明。文中有云：『　鐘，鍊冶超精，　奇古，波磔飛動，捫之有稜，鐘聲似云：『懊惱來」」，大概日本賠償之新鐘，係仿眞鑄造。寒又盟軍總部命令日本政府調査　山古鐘踪跡，係根據我國政府交涉。茲誌寒山寺住持培元於卅六年十一月具呈吳縣縣府原文如下：</p>
<p>「爰僧寺向有唐時古鐘，早年被日本人大隈伯陰謀串竊，運往日本，嗣經交涉，由大隈伯鑄鐘認賠，其用心在狡匿古鐘，當時爲理所屈，凂伊藤博文出面轉圖，鑄鐘認賠，並於新鐘上鐫明認竊，當時僧寺深虞牽動國際，影響邦交，不得不含糊了事，半以日本朝野人士多以鐘失所在，搜索不得等語搪塞·迄康有爲先生遊寺題詩，證明原鐘尙在日本，又以島夷勢燄鴟張，容忍未發，而返璧還珠之心，未嘗一日去懷。抗戰勝利而後，日本在我國劫取物資，議得報請政府交涉追回，則僧寺古鐘，當不例外，特將新鐘攝影，並抄鐘上鐫文與康有爲先生題詩刻石拓本，連同備呈，報由佛敎會層級轉呈層峯，先行向日本交涉外，理合分呈鈞府鑒核，賜予援助，呈請層峯加緊交涉，以期達到追回原鐘之目的，不惟佾寺能增不少光榮，亦即鈞府同造無量功德，謹陳蟻見，仰候鴻裁，僧寺不勝懇禱翹瞻之至』。</p>

<p>— 李漢魂</p>
<p>崎嶇大道</p>
<p>如今工黨在英國施行之政策，即爲此種方案之遺留與修改。英國之傳統精神，爲自己發生毛病之後，再由自己醫治。有自尊心之民族，皆應如是。</p>
<p>英國目前所循之路爲一崎嶇大道。蓋其一方面承襲舊文明之成果，一方面正培育新文明之嫰芽。歷史，地理之傳統，使英國不偏不倚屹立中間，向崎嶇大道邁進。</p>
<p>在英國工業革命開始之時，其他各國仍停滯於小規模農業生產或農業文明已發生破綻，而正需求變革之階段。工業文明固使英國文明向前躍進一步，同時亦使世界文明爲之丕變。此種程序與成果爲　英國及全世界人民所熟知。但英國及全世界人民又洞悉工業又明有其不可避免之弊病，而醫治此種弊病之良方，在受優越地理，歷史條件，注重實際之英國民族觀之，在乎改良而不在乎突變；在乎漸進，而不在乎跳躍。換言之，不流血之革命，在八百年來之英國歷史上，已經收穫宏大顯明之果實，何以不能繼續運用此種方法，以解決當前一切問題？此英國人憧憬，亦英國人之信念也。</p>
<p>工業文明所產生最大之弊病爲獨佔不均，失業等；而此種弊病，在現在英國工黨，已在力求改革中。以滿足各個人基本需要爲出發點而規定分配制度，比如食物定量分配，每星期規定一個或且不及一個之鷄蛋，每餐有塲即無麵包等，富有之人固無法　餮揮霍，普通平民亦可果腹療饑。</p>
<p>由此可見英國現行政策爲經濟均等政策。大企業劃歸國家經營，可無資本家獨佔之病。實行各種社會保險法，使全國人民獲得安全與保陣，减少全國的失業以至於無。增加生產效率而不須延長工作時間，並且還要限制工資，凡此均爲否定舊文明而啓示新文明之路。從往哲「謀最大多數之最大幸福」之理論，到如今食物定量分配，與大企業歸國家經營等政策，均使英國社會不流血而逐漸走入新階段。大道雖然不免崎嶇，但其前途甚光明，明眼人皆能預測之。</p>
<p>英國工黨現在推行之經濟政策，與中國國民黨民生主義之經濟政策極爲近似。蓋中英兩國在歷史文化上共通相似之處頗多，故其適用於人民生活之基本理論與方案亦多相似。問題是在彼能澈底執行，而我未完全實現。孫總理曾指出三民主義即社會主義，所不同者方法。倘有不須經過流血而能達到社會革命之途徑，志士仁人，當無不樂爲悉力以赴者也。中英兩國有共同之目標，對於世界均衡俱負重要之責任，倘能比肩並進，必能並爲世界安定之柱石，可爲斷言。</p>

<p>〔本報金華十九日訊〕來到金華的人，却忘不了火腿的美味，也忘不了北山的幽勝，更急急乎要看一看「鬥牛」的玩意兒。</p>
<p>鬥牛之風，不僅金華獨有，金華鄰縣之義烏，浦江，蘭谿，武義等縣也有，不過在金華更常見罷了。以金華說，則東北鄉比西南鄉更盛；東北鄕如曹宅，岑下，山口馮，鞋塘，中紫岩，後壠等地，差不多十天一鬥甚少間斷。此種風習，起於何時，已無法考究，但是已由來悠久，久而成習了。正因爲是舊金屬一帶之民間習俗，所以沒有人可以出而干預，過去的州官，知府，知縣等父母官也多爲順應民情，不敢加以禁止。相沿成習，至今風行。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，因農村勞力不够，農村經濟衰竭，鬥牛之風一度稍减。及至三十一年，金蘭相繼淪敵，農民四散逃亡，鬥牛之舉，一度絕跡。及抗戰軍興，金蘭一帶農民爲歡欣大難不死，因而生活由儉僕趨向奢逸，於是鬥牛之盛舉，又在鄕村間流行。</p>
<p>也許有讀者想急於知道鬥牛是怎麼件玩意兒吧？因爲許多讀者都已在電影裏看到過西班牙鬥牛那種驚人心魄的嚇人塲面；但是金華的鬥牛却是另一種式樣。金華鬬牛是牛與牛角鬥。選擇一坵廣闊平坦而四周又有淺山隆起的水田作爲鬥牛塲。這種鬥牛塲大槪屬於廟產，或由地主撥捐的田產，常終年用作鬥牛之用武地，大多任令荒廢不事種植。在鬥牛開始之前，水田犂平，灌入適量之水；田之四角，各以二支靑竹弓成旌門，懸燈結綵。在禮砲高鳴聲中，相鬥的一對鬥牛就由牛親家（相鬥之一對牛的主人，因鬥牛而成親熱之交）牽引，自對角的二座旌門緩步上塲，大模大樣，不可一世地各自鬥牛塲之一角緩緩趨近，當兩牛接近，雙方的主人即把自己的牛之牛繩抽出，這時兩牛便死命角鬥起來，互不相讓。也有「掛」，『撞』，「抽」……等戰術，每一頭牛有侮一頭牛的戰略戰術，均欲出奇制勝，鬥敗對方，看鬥牛的人，也就看這些戰略與戰術。在二頭牛進行之際，旁邊佇候着數十位拆這種拆牛者都是年靑力壯的農民，多具有勇決的胆識與熟練的技巧，這種人是世襲的，上代祖先拆牛，下代子孫亦不得推諉；除在鬥牛之日，由寺廟供給酒肉大嚼之外，並無另外報酬。但是工作却相當艱危，侮當兩牛鬥至勝敗初露之際，即須一擁向前，把兩頭牛分開，不使繼續角鬥。因此常有「拆牛者」在拆牛之際爲蠻性的牛撞翻在田中，甚有被角重傷致死者。</p>
<p>有的時候，也有來不及使兩牛相鬥初露勝負之際即行拆開的，於是敗牛向鬥塲外狼狽逃命，勝牛狼奔逐北，死命緊追，不肯稍讓。於是拆牛者也緊跟牛後設計拖回。在勝負分明之後，敗牛主人偸偸地拖自己的牛帶回去買了作耕牛或宰殺出售。戰勝的牛主人，則把鬥牛洗刷乾凈，加鳳冠紅綵於牛身，耀武揚威地在鼓鑼喧天聲中浩浩蕩蕩的乘興歸去。</p>
<p>普通的鬥牛塲合，參加角鬥的牛，總在五六十對以上，也有在一二百對以上。這種角鬥的牛，多由鄰村趕來，但在大規模的鬥牛，就有遠在百里外的鄰近縣份趕來。爲了赴塲相鬥的鬥牛都有用武的機會起見，往往在同一水田里，同時有三對四對牛相鬥。這時水田四週的淺山上，便成了觀鬥台，人山人海地坐上站着成千成萬的紅男綠女。</p>
<p>這種參與角鬥的牛，多不必與其他耕牛一樣下田操作，「鬥牛」成爲牠唯一任務。平日養尊處優其享受常超過一般人的生活，主人每天餵飼白糯米飯，酒糟，黄豆等，在參戰前夕，更飼以參湯及頂好老酒，使之興奪神經。冬日牛檻墊得格外暖。夏日，有雇牧童爲其打扇，亦有爲其張掛蚊帳，使不受蚊擾而染疾。總之，一般富農對待一頭百戰百勝的鬥牛是近乎用着款待上賓之禮的。普通鬥牛的牛多由富農侗養，若在盛行鬥牛之區，村里有不飼鬥牛的富農，常會受地方輿論的制裁。</p>
<p>一般鬥牛，大概從夏季開始，除去氣候過劣或農忙期間外，多每隔十天「一角」鬥，至次年夏季方才休止。因此，週而復始，差不多整年不停；連年累月依例而行，甚少間斷。這種習俗所以能例行不輟，主要的原因：（一）農村缺少正當娛樂，借鬥牛作爲一種娛樂。（二）農村缺乏敎育，迷信「鬥牛」可以免除獸疫，想借此驅除疫癘，保護他們唯一的重要勞動工具。（三）農民信佛，藉此酬神縣政當局以此種習俗荒時廢業，勞民傷財，曾三令五申嚴禁鬥牛之舉，曾經實施三種取締辦法：（一）將利用爲鬥牛塲而不事耕種的田畝，撥充學校基金；（二）參與角鬥的牛一律强迫宰殺；（三）將爲首倡「鬥牛」之舉者加以逮捕懲辦。但是，辦法雖佳，還是敵不過地方固有之習俗，鬥牛之風水盛行於金華及與金華相隣的各縣鄕間，與「鬥牛」宣戰的政府也軟了下來而採取「聽之」的態度了。（本報記者蔣風）</p>

<h3 id="c155">女人與服裝 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>愛美和愛新奇，是人的天性，尤其是太太小姐們，照「女爲悅已者容」的說法，愛打扮和愛漂亮，更可說是她們份內之事。說句實話，那一個先生不樂意見自己的太太打扮得漂漂亮亮，那一個有千金的父親，不願見自己的女兒像花枝兒一般？這種心理才是眞的人情，才是常態心理。</p>
<p>好像法朗克·哈里斯魯這樣說過：世界上要是沒有了女人，就像花園中祗有樹木一樣，雖見蒼鬱，總不免是太寂寞了，太單調了。所以聖神如耶和華，在常初創造了亞當之後，還從他身上抽了骨肉，創造了一個夏娃，給他做伴。</p>
<p>不過上帝雖能創造女人，但恐怕神聖如他，當初也未見得懂得女人的心理。他以爲女人僅是供男人的需要而設，所以最初不願使他們知進這個世界可能有服飾之美，祗令他倆赤裸裸的在伊甸園中過活。</p>
<p>可是夏娃畢竟是一個女人，在她尙未有女性美的自覺之前，她終於先受了那雙鮮紅的蘋果的誘惑，雖有耶和華的事先嚴重警吿，她還是喫了。她這一喫不打緊，却世世代代便宜了時裝店的老板，而苦了先生們的口袋。爲甚麽？因爲自從她喫了蘋果之後，就有了羞恥觀念，就要求穿衣服了。</p>
<p>服裝問題在一部份人看來也許無所謂，可是對於女人却是第二生命，這決不是誇大，不久前英美的女子不是爲了裙子的長短問題曾舉行過示威運動嗎？我非道學之士，我甚至認爲一國的婦女肯爲區區服裝問題而作示威運動，恰是證明了這個國家社會多麽的富於生氣。反之，人人一律靑布長衫，樸素固然是樸素了，然而也無非證明這一國家的窮酸而已。</p>
<p>要知美的問題，並非即是奢侈的問題。試看有些珠光寳氣逼人的太太小姐們，豪華是豪華了，然而除了滿身俗氣外，就絲毫也不能找出美。美的觀念是從一個人的精神陶冶中培養出來的。如果太太小姐們肯從她們的服裝上注意到美的情調，確乎能使社會增色不少。不過必須注意到敎養的美才不致流於庸俗。否則翻短翻長，徒求形式的新奇，這才是浪費而不是求美觀</p>
<h3 id="c156">相等與相似 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑織英</p>
<p>相等和相似在幾何學上有着絕不相同的定義，但是，有計多人却把這二個名詞混爲一談，舉個例來說，歷史的重演只包拈了兩件或者數件史實的相似的意義，然而有很多人，甚至於學者和敎授們，都以爲歷史的重演是前後相等的。</p>
<p>一個極大的等邊三角形和一個極小的等邊三角形，雖然它們的三內角都是「相等」於六十度，不過，從這兩個整個的正三角形來看，僅僅是屬於幾何學上的「相似」；同樣的，歷史無論如何總是過去的事實，嚴格的說起米，歷史決不會重演，至多有」部分的環境似乎有些相像，或者　某些因素相同而已，第一次世界大戰後的德國和第二次世界大戰後的日本，其處境固然非常相　，其遭遇也十分酷似，但是，我們總不能說德國就「相等」於日本呀！</p>
<p>有人銳，歷史像一條正絃曲綫Sine　curve，從函數爲零起，經過正，零，負一而回到零，再按這樣的次序週而復始的演進着，驟視起來，這學說似乎有些像我們三國演義　明義　第一句：「話說天下大勢，分久必合，合久必分。」如果仔細分析一下，我們就知道前者是代表週期性　「相當」，侮隔三百六十度所得到的函數値是絕對相同的；但是後者却部然，這句老調充分表現了我們中國人說話的藝術和圓滑，它只說明了「相似」的意義，外表上似乎很肯定，實際上，等於說：「晴天了多時以後，天一定會下雨的；下了雨以後，天一定爲轉晴的。」雖然斬釘截鐵的說了兩次「一定」，可是「久」與「以後」都沒有時間的限制，因此，我認爲這僅是代表「相似」三角形中的部分「相等」。</p>
<p>再舉一個例子來說，在某種環境之下，尤其是在溫馨的氣氛中，諸如燈下靜讀，埋首凝思，樹下小休等情形，常會使人泛起一極熟悉的感覺，其實，也許你的確經驗過這種鏡頭，因爲這環境能够使你精神　感到愉快輕鬆，所以很容易產生一種印象，一遇相似的情形就聯想起過去的鏡頭，可是，事實上環境多少有些變遷，不可能完全相同，除非年華倒流。</p>
<p>春夏秋冬四季，終年循環不息，可是每年季候不同，儘管它天氣溫暖寒冷，平均氣溫相等的能有多次？</p>
<p>所以，愛因斯坦就說過：世界上沒有一件事可以說　　對「相等一的。</p>
<h3 id="c157">北平的白雲觀 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 劉雁聲</p>
<p>每遇年節，一般人士多喜出遊。加以年節名勝地方，文都約期開放，猶之乎天津的娘娘宮，上海　邑廟，前往遊覽　人，在信佛道塲摩　禮拜的固然不在少數，屬於以遊　　　的，與二于三朋友以快耳目的，更是不少。北平年節開放地方，又以在城外郊野者居多，所以我們在新年期間裏看見了不少絡繹於道的人們，都是去遊覽春節名勝的。</p>
<p>杜工部麗人行云：「三月三日天氣新，長安水邊多麗人」，這還『以說是氣候暖和，藉機出遊。以現在說，這些人不怕春寒料峭，冬意還未退去的滋味，前往一遊，可以說是典致不淺了。</p>
<p>北平西郊的白雲觀，就是新歲中開放日子最多的。其他如東嶽廟大鐘寺廠甸等處，都差不多以開放到上一元節爲止，獨白雲觀是以舊歷正月十九日爲收廟之日，而前一日又有居士們放堂施捨，晚　又有「會神仙」之舉，雖說涉及逃信，但是這種流風遺俗，遞傳許久，並沒有衰落的徵象，在大家歡呼愉快渡過春節之頃，有這許多點綴，也增加了不少繁華景象。</p>
<p>白雲觀是北平近郊道敎一大寺院，是元邱處機的行宮，領導道敎的力量很大．由於淸末白　觀方丈參　了宮庭行事以後，　力驟增，許多富買都願意前去隨喜。　年舊歷年節開放的時候，招商　設貨攤，觀裏的老道也全體出動，辦理春節開放事情。一般遊人，　在年簡總覺非到白雲觀去遊覽不可。過去在民國元二年一直到十幾年，白雲觀後有跑車跑馬之舉，兩旁搭起茶樓，當中是很寬的跑道，一般公子哥兒，因爲自己家裏有車有馬，就到這個地方，大出風頭，彼此比賽。雖然沒有花紅綵獎，但是以車馬漂亮，跑街第一，是最露臉最出風頭的事情。跑過的時候，茶樓　面品茶人們，呼喊喝彩，很像現在賽球的拉拉隊似的。然而這已隨着生活高漲，時代變遷，不僅興致毫無，在當年的富厚之家，如今也感覺力量不足，所以在無形中廢止了。現在跑道猶存，但當年叱咤比賽的人們，不知道現在到什麽地方去了！</p>
<p>白雲觀離北平城不很遠，遊人代步，除各種車輛以外，還有一種每逢年節常見之景，就是大家騎驢前往。在拂面春風中，平曠沙原上，騎着小驢，也是北平春節中一幅行樂畫圖』現在，騎一趟驢的代價，在當年是頗可多買幾頭長耳公了。李雨文在一個宴會上，名提琴家海斐滋（Joshua　Heifetz）被介紹給一位得過錦標的拳擊家。爲了禮　，海氏只得和他應酬應　。</p>
<p>倆是同行」，海氏說，「我們都是靠手吃飯的，哈哈。』</p>
<p>這位拳擊家　細的打量打量他，說：</p>
<p>「嚇，你倒還好，臉上倒還沒有什麽記號哩！」</p>
<h3 id="c158">談忍 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 惕齋</p>
<p>頗有人稱道杜牧之的詩句：「忍過事堪喜」。其實這無非「小不忍則亂大謀』的消極說法罷了，本亦沒有若何稀奇。若是細細推敲，倒是那能忍的工夫，是進德之士不易達到的一種境界，大約所謂「堪喜」者，其對象不是那所忍的事，而是自家的修持耳。佛家亦有忍辱精進之說，所阿Q不同，彼尙有一虛懸之勝利感以慰藉其空洞的心情，失敗的情緒，此則非眞的「無無明」「亦無無無明盡」「無眼耳鼻舌身意，無色聲香味觸法」不可也。若不是把諸相都看做空的，則「無明業火」，無有不起者。耶穌勸人，有人打你左頰，把右頰也給他，此非純粹的忍，乃更有犧牲的作用在內，吾所謂忍者，狹義的不動聲色之謂。在我個人，這個德目，是着實做不到的。</p>
<p>忍的反面就是爭，爭是古今聖賢所反對的。只有好疑古的崔東壁先生主張過爭，作了一篇皇皇大文，名曰「爭論」，其中有不少妙論，恕我不能一一抄之。我只是覺得忍是一種生理上，精神上絕大負荷，這忍的來源，一定是有怒字在內，按照西洋科學家說法，飢·懼·痛·怒這些一事，是會影響到神經的劇烈變化的，盛怒的犬，用×光照之，其胃部立即停止蠕動，而消化可以停息兩小時以上。人雖在位置上高於犬，怒與生理感應當無二致，所以我說忍辱，亦即含怒是生理上的負荷。至於精神上，那不待我說，人人可以明了。我這裏又提一意見，即忍辱與殘忍未嘗不可納入一源是也。忍辱是對已的，殘忍是對人的，但其基本趨向是一個，曰：「不近人情」。張獻忠黄巢殺人爲樂，麻叔謀以吃人肉爲樂，固然是萬惡不赦的殘忍祖師，日本人點着白紙燈籠，於暗　剖腹，而又命其好朋友砍下頭來，（日人稱之爲「介錯」）何嘗不是殘忍？不能說對人殘忍是惡，對已殘忍就是善，固然，我們不能把一切忍都比作切腹，然其忍受一種不願意承受的負荷，實與忍受挨殺之基本情調無殊。所以我猜想，一個能够忍他人之所不忍者，大率便是殘忍的傢伙，歷史上例子多得數不淸，越王勾踐給吳王嘗糞，臥薪嚐膽，到後來也便殺文種而疏范大夫了；漢王分食老父之羹，到後來便殺韓信，　彭越了，范增的話眞有意思：「君王爲人不忍』，這不忍兩個字，就活畫出一個老實忠厚的項王，而其不能成大功，作大事，固已命定矣。</p>
<p>孟子講得更好，便是「人皆有不忍人之心」，亦即惻隱之心，而是「仁之端也」。此心好像應該很易發揮的，但是自古至今，眞能處處行起不忍來的人到底有幾何，全部中國史沒有戰爭的年代連幾十年都沒有，你就可以知這人類之所謂文化，文明，究竟是個什麽東西！戰爭不過是忍的最具體之一面，整個社會始終是剝削者與被剝削者兩個階層，你若不是剝削者，勢必成爲被剝削者，其生存都是站在忍字上的；被剝削者要忍受苦楚，以換得溫飽，剝削者要閉眼不看偌多可憐蟲，才能喂飽自己的荷包。我因之常常感覺到伊索寓　是非常無理的，爲什麽要拿狐狸獅子狗和驢子形容人，老實說，獸類的社會，實在比人類要「人化」得多，至少像上述兩種關係是不存在的，賣淫，花柳病，訴訟，僞君子，……是不存在的，雖然英人Hobbes說「人與人相遇如遇狼」，然狼到底比人好對付得多了。這個歸根結蒂，無非因爲獸類沒有「忍」的美德與　念。不信請你再看，慈愛了一生的甘地，夙主不抵抗，他的性命又如何？</p>

<p>「你是塔夫脫法官，可是？」替塔夫脫修面的理髮師問這。</p>
<p>「不錯，我是的」塔夫脫回答說，把他的龐大的身軀舒服的安置着。</p>
<p>「記得」個呌斯達賓士的人嗎？你判了他二十年的徒刑。」理髮師異常細心的磨着一把剃刀。他是一個身材高大的黑漢子。塔夫脫注意到他臉上的一條從　骨　　到　部的醜陋的疤痕。</p>
<p>「是的，我記得斯達賓士，」塔付脫回答說，『一個壞蛋。」</p>
<p>「他是我的兄弟，」理髪師說。他正把剃刀放在法官的　子上。在以後的幾分鐘之中，這個小理髪店的唯一的聲響祗是剃刀的刮擦聲。當銳利的刀鋒在塔夫脫的下顎與喉嚨之間上下刮剃的時候，他覺得他自己開始流汗了。他閉上了眼睛，默想着生命的結束，和等等待。</p>
<p>最後，理髪師走到背從，拍的一聲關上了他爲剃刀。「好，法官，」他說。「你做很對。我的兄弟不是一個好人。他這種人是活該坐牢　的。」</p>

<p>法國的貢但親王有心要試試他的兒子理財的才能，就在自己離開巴黎之前交給那個孩子五十個金路易（法國以前的一種金幣—譯名），任他自由化用。</p>
<p>親王回家的時候，那個孩子很高興的跑到他的面前說：「父親，錢在這兒，我一點也沒有用掉。」</p>
<p>親王一不響，把他的兒子引到窗口，默然把五十個金路易全部丢到窗外的街道上。</p>
<p>然後，他說：「孩子，如果你是有「德』的，你一定已把這些錢送給別人；如果你是有「能力」的，你就會把這些錢非常適當地用掉。如果你無德無能，那麼你在將來應當常常照我現在這樣的做法—至少讓窮苦的人們也有一點得到你的錢的機會。」</p>

<p>— 余信華</p>
<p>陶潛不肯爲五斗米折腰，解印歸田，晚年曾有乞食詩這：「　來　我去，不知竟何之：行行至斯里，即門拙會詞。」他的　困，可想而知。唐代名詩人王維，寫給魏居士的信，有一段曾經這樣講：「近有陶潛，不肯把版屈腰見督郵，解印綬棄官去，後貧乞食，詩云：『即門拙言詞』，是屢乞而多慚也。苟一見督郵，安食公田數頃，一慚之不忍，而終身慚乎？」</p>
<p>如果站在實利主義者的立塲，王維說的倒是老實話；與其窮而討飯，還不如拚着受氣，去做縣長快活，可是「餓死事小，失節事大」，陶潛的不肯見督郵，老早就被一班人看作道是他「不事二姓」的飾辭，所以道學家們，對王維的一審話，都是表示深惡痛絕的。</p>
<p>據說王維會唱鬱輪袍曲，深爲常時某公主所賞識，因而得成進士，而後來又投降過安祿山，受過偽署，所以明末淸初的張爾岐，便着實的數落了王維一頓，他說：「摩詰見解乃爾，據此而推，鬱輪袍非誣也。當其把鄭虔手，灑涕詠凝碧池頭之句，與央因首聽處分時，迴想柴桑老人，曳杖訪親知風味，孰慚孰不慚？」駡得頗爲毒辣，這也難怪，張爾岐原是顧亭林一流人物，明亡以後，都隱居著書，對於王維，自然要大加嘲　了。</p>
<p>杜甫有一首奉贈　去丞丈詩云：「騎驢三十敝，旅食京華春，朝扣富兒門，暮隨肥馬塵，殘杯與冷炙，到處潛悲辛。」一副搖尾乞憐之狀，實在可厭，龔定庵曾有詩嘲笑杜甫道：「陶潛磊落性情溫，冥報因他一飯恩，頗覺少陵詩吻薄，但言朝叩富兒門。」同一乞食，但一個是棄官不爲，一個是熟中功名，二者相較，實不可以道里計了。</p>

<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>大學者，高等學術機關也，顧名思義，理應如何的具有濃厚的學術空氣。今日的大學，其內幕如何，非我所知；我在大學念書時，別的大學之內幕如何，亦非我所知。我雖非孟母，却也會三易大學。就我個人的經驗母，可略述印象如下。</p>
<p>學過於重視考試。入學一有大學考試，學期中有規定的數次所謂「小考」，隨時又有教師「與到為之」的臨時考試，學期終了自然又有所謂「大考」。學生所選科自非只一門，敎師又不止一人，於是你考我考，今日考，明日考，三日一小考，五日一大考，考得頭昏腦漲，心頭之　　哀無可言喩，横考堅考，其意何在，至今莫名。記得最可笑者，有一位美國先生，　教的是英文，所探的課本史希文森的金銀島，有一次舉行考試，他出的題目頗爲新奇，他間：金銀島醫中所記共有幾個强盜，到某章止，還剩幾名？吁！這種問題豈與英文成續之優劣有什麽關係哉？學生化了大好的光陰與金錢，本該着力於於如何傾其全副精力學取其所欲得的學識，而今竟耗費於無聊的考試中，寗非大可惋惜之事？</p>
<p>大學也與我國別的機關一樣，已只剩了一個形式。師生但知打鈴相應上課，打鈴等因下課。一聞鈴聲，學生便如一羣羔羊般的魚　而入課堂，又聞鈴聲，便如釋重負地魚貫而出敎室。敎師之中，博學鴻儒固也間或有之，可是志只在吃敎育飯者，其數亦不在少。此輩授課時，或信口雌黄或言語支吾，總之是隨口胡為，鮮中覈要，於是敎師自顧自的念念有詞，學生大平自顧自的竊竊私議。少數心地忠厚智力較　之士則振筆疾書，把敎師的念念有詞摘爲筆記。更有少數才智之士，惜時間之浪費，乃或作書，或自顧自的埋頭讀他所愛讀之書，</p>
<p>大學之最令人不解的一點，莫過於所謂「學分」制度·你必須修滿「歷史」共五學分，「國文」六學分，「銀行學」。四學分，「貨幣學」三學分……如果你對「銀行學」毫無興趣，或自知於「銀行學」知，識己頗高明，初無再修四學分之必要，却欲以「貨幣學」另增四學分代替之，而把此意吿知敎務處，敎務處除目你爲怪異之餘，必英聲曰：「烏乎可！」良以學校當局所備「貨色』，關於所謂銀行學者，只此四分，關於貨幣者，只此三學分，無可增損，學生自亦無從掉換。此無異按住了馬的頭飲水。馬如甘願任你按扭，此馬也必非駿馬了。不過這也難怪，校方伯樂無多，只好把學生一律視作劣馬了事。而學生修滿了欽定的若干科目若干學分，經所謂「考試及格」後，便算「畢業」，得稱所謂「學士」，或別的什麽士；這簡直是一件神秘莫測，不可思議的事。</p>
<p>在這種師資貧乏，徒尙形式的情形之下，學術空氣喪失殆盡——或者可以說根本沒有學術空氣存在過。學生進入這種大學去求學，直不啻是「緣木求魚」。其勞民傷財，廢時失業，莫此爲甚。</p>
<p>嘗細思之：學子入大學，必須經過「入學考試」，其理何在？比方一個商人，忽覺對於「考據」頗感興趣，而胡適博士於「　據」之學最有硏究，名聞國內國外，這位商人便亟欲一聆胡適博士的宏論，假定這位商人事務相當的忙，對於入學必考的科目如英文代數等等並不諳熟，或雖從前知道，而今已全忘了，而所感興趣的只是胡適博士所授的考據學一科。在入學必經考試的這個限制之下，這位商人便不易達到他的目的，只好放棄他求學的志願了。大學敎育固非義務敎育，但這位商人，他有餘錢足以繳納學費，他有求學的志趣，我們有什麽理由摒他於大學門外呢？爲了要硏究考據，如果這位商人放棄了他的業務，重新硏讀了英文代數等等科目去應試，即使幸蒙錄取了，這個代價豈不是太大呢？此其一。其次：大學規定四年制，其理又何在？若是把「學年」視作囚犯的「苦役」，或是和尙的「坐關』，那麽人生幾何？二年尙嫌其多。如果其把「敎育」當作「敎育」看，則四十年尙嫌太少；我們所要學習之事物，　是口年之中所能學得了？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Remaining Ammunition and Air Force Equipment: US Agrees to Sell to China at Discount; MacArthur Declares He Cannot Leave Japan to Return to Country <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The State Department submitted a memorandum to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, notifying Congress that US military aid has already begun its journey to assist China's anti-communist forces. The memorandum revealed that several contracts have been approved to sell surplus American war materials to the Chinese government at the lowest prices, including aircraft and ammunition. Diplomatic sources said that the Chinese loan technology delegation has also received assurances that the US Army will search for surplus aircraft throughout the Pacific region to provide aid to China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The House has received a report proving that the United States has agreed to sell ammunition and air force equipment to China at a discount, but the total amount has not been disclosed. It is only known that it includes: (1) a contract signed on January 7, stipulating that surplus ammunition on the Mariana Islands will be sold to China at one percent of the original price; (2) a contract signed on January 30, stipulating that all surplus materials within the United States will be sold at a discount of 17.5 cents per dollar, with the exception of certain aircraft; (3) a contract signed on December 8 of last year, stipulating that 96 naval vessels under the Lend-Lease Act will be transferred to China free of charge, with an original value of $67 million. Last year, 130 million rounds of ammunition were sold to China at a discount of 10 cents per dollar, and 150 C-46 transport aircraft were sold at an actual price of $5,000 per aircraft, with an original price of $276,000 per aircraft.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Marshall warned Congress on the 20th that China has the possibility of collapsing without US assistance. If this were to happen, it would "make our situation in Japan extremely serious" and "the US position in Korea would be difficult to maintain." At the same time, Marshall acknowledged that Congress should expedite the legislation on the European aid plan and set aside aid to China until the European aid plan is passed. Marshall said that since China's "Third Party" is unlikely to take over the government, once the government collapses, everything north of the Yangtze River will fall entirely into the hands of the Communist forces. Regarding the "deterioration" of the Chinese military situation, Marshall said that the National Government's army "has no hope of victory unless there is a sound foundation and excellent leadership," conditions that cannot be resolved at present. The fatal wound of the Chinese military organization is "the drafting of ignorant rural youths who are directly sent to units for combat without training." When he was in China, he advised the Chinese government that these youths should be trained before enlisting, and he repeatedly told the Chinese government's officials, but although they expressed great agreement, they did nothing.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Judd, disregarding Secretary of State Marshall's opinion, repeatedly demanded military aid to China, and last night suggested inviting Chennault to fly back to Washington to present his views to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Republican Senator Smith announced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 20th that he would request General MacArthur to return to the United States from Tokyo to guide aid to China and other Far Eastern issues. Democratic Senator Arrington said that foreign aid programs are extremely important to the United States and the world, and although no one has mentioned the widespread discussion of MacArthur as a Republican presidential candidate, he deeply resents using foreign aid programs to achieve his political goals. Speaker Eakins also said that this motion must be for political reasons.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 21st] General MacArthur issued a statement on the 21st: "American people advocate that I return to the country to state my opinion on the aid to China plan to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which shows deep love, and I am very grateful. However, I believe that the committee does not need to insist on the previous proposal. The current political situation in Japan is turbulent, and the government is in the process of transition. I am bound by my duties and cannot leave my post at this time."</p>
<h3 id="e2">$570 Million in Aid to China Funds: US Releases Detailed Program; Shanghai Power Company to Receive Assistance <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The US State Department released the full detailed program of the $570 million aid to China plan on the 20th. This document is divided into eight sections, plus eight appendices, totaling 73 pages. The amount of aid to China calculated in US dollars in the document is as follows: (1) Up to June 30, 1949, a total of $510 million will be used to subsidize important inputs, including 225,000 tons of wheat worth $130 million and 451,300 tons of rice, 750,000 bales of cotton worth $150 million, and petroleum products worth $110 million (China's total needs, according to estimates, are petroleum worth $134,969,000, 25,000,199 barrels, but the aid to China plan stipulates $110 million). Fertilizer worth $30 million, tobacco worth $28 million (84.5 million pounds), non-ferrous products worth $24 million (17,588 tons) and steel products (115,373 tons), medicines worth $5 million, and spare parts worth $30 million for existing machinery and equipment. (2) $60 million will be used to subsidize various construction projects of the Shanghai Power Company, the Austrian-Hankow Railway, and the Ganxi and Hunan Xiangtan coal mines, possibly including the restoration of Taiwan sugar factories, Taiwan South China fertilizer plants, cement plants, and wharf facilities.

<h3 id="e3">Ambassador Stuart's Remarks: Explaining Motives for Writing to Chinese People <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 21st] US Ambassador to China Dr. John Leighton Stuart met with a United Press International reporter alone on the 21st to explain the motives for publishing the "Letter to the Chinese People" two days ago, saying that he believed that the "best" solution to the China problem was to reopen negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Ambassador Stuart emphasized that this was his personal opinion and not necessarily the official attitude of the US State Department. Ambassador Stuart said that one of the motives for his decision to publish the letter to the Chinese people was that he believed that negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party might resume, but the ambassador also said: "Not the main motive." Ambassador Stuart explained his "main motive": "The reason why this statement was published is that I believe that the only hope for China and other countries to achieve democracy is that their people can recognize their rights and obligations. China is not short of selfless people. If they can effectively unite and promote the will of the people, then they can help the government benefit the country." The US ambassador said that his statement "was published on my own initiative, but with the full agreement of the State Department." Ambassador Stuart admitted that it is unusual for a foreign envoy to directly appeal to the people of the host country, but the ambassador continued: "In view of the seriousness of the situation in China, I believe that I have a friendly relationship with the Chinese people, so I went beyond my authority to point out that if the government, all sectors of the country, especially politically conscious non-partisans, can voluntarily unite, abandon internal strife, and seek solutions, then there is still a completely hopeful solution." Asked whether "various sectors" included communists, Ambassador Stuart replied: "I have always believed that the best solution is for the government and the Communist Party to reopen negotiations to reach a peaceful solution." Asked whether his "Letter to the Chinese People" should be interpreted as a criticism of the National Government, Ambassador Stuart declared: "I absolutely do not need to declare that this statement is not against the Chinese government. On the contrary, this statement is enough to help the government complete its goals. I have always believed that the leaders of the Chinese government are pursuing their goals without ever stopping."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS report on the night of the 20th, stating that the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty signed in 1937 had a term of five years, and the term was extended for two years in 1942, 1944, and 1946. Now that both China and the Soviet Union have not announced their cancellation six months before the expiration date, the "extension" will be "extended to 1950.</p>

<p>[United Press International, this city] Two US cruisers and twelve destroyers rushed out to sea on the 21st to participate in large-scale simulated war exercises. The Western Pacific Fleet stationed in Qingdao and the Thirty-Eighth Task Force originally in Pearl Harbor both participated. The Western Pacific Fleet under the direction of Rear Admiral Kirk, including the cruisers Topeka and Duluth and eight destroyers, will meet between Okinawa and Hong Kong with the task force carrier Valley Forge and four destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Martin. The exercise was originally scheduled to be held in mid-January, but was postponed until now because the task force visited the east coast of Australia before coming to China. The Valley Forge and its affiliated destroyers sailed from Hong Kong on the morning of the 21st, and the Topeka and Duluth left Shanghai on February 18 and will meet with the destroyer fleet sailing from Qingdao at sea. The exercise includes strategic maneuvers and simulated warfare. After the exercise, the task force may return to Pearl Harbor, and the Western Pacific Force will be divided into two groups, with one cruiser and 1-2 destroyers coming to Shanghai, and the rest returning to Qingdao, so that Rear Admiral Badger can take over Kirk's post on February 14.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Qingdao, 20th] The new commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, Rear Admiral Badger, met with an Associated Press reporter alone here today and expressed his feelings on taking office: "The United States is fortunate to have a well-trained reserve fleet that is not afraid to deal with any naval contingency in the near future. The US Navy Reserve has a total of 900,000 members, and the training is very good and constantly improving."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] The British Trade Mission to China published a report today stating: "It is difficult to expect an expansion of trade between China and Britain in the near future. The reason for this pessimism lies in the fact that China is still unstable. However, a deeply rooted nation will eventually overcome its difficulties. At that time, the development of trade between China and Britain will be unlimited." The mission was led by the Financial Secretary Cripps (then Minister of Trade) and led by Boss, Chairman and General Manager of the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. They inspected China from October 8 to December 14, 1946, traveling about 8,000 miles. The report, which was drafted after returning to the country, is 50,000 words long and is now published. The report put forward suggestions to develop trade between China and Britain, the most important of which are: to open Dalian to facilitate international trade and to develop resources in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The report also stated that for many years to come, Hong Kong may still be the main port for trade with China, and the British government should send a trade representative to Hong Kong as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Central Committee of the Kuomintang held a subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 21st to discuss and resolve the issue of party members in the National Assembly delegates conceding.

It was decided at the meeting to handle the matter according to law, and a legal interpretation will be announced within a few days to facilitate the handling. At the same time, many opinions were also raised on the issue of concessions to friendly parties. It is generally believed that the government is determined to fulfill its past promises in order to implement the ideal of party politics, and especially hopes that the lists submitted by friendly parties can be selected as much as possible. Therefore, it is currently seeking a reasonable path. (Continued on page 2, column 3)</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The representatives of Tianjin and Beijing attending the grain allocation meeting of the five cities have reached a satisfactory solution to the problem of negotiating loans for purchasing grain, and plan to visit Nanjing and Shanghai to observe the actual situation of allocation and sales before returning to their posts to prepare for the allocation and sales.

It is now known that the decision today is to allocate funds as needed, without rigid specifications on the amount.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Southwestern Sui "Northwest Government": Thoroughly Suppressed by National Army; Puppet Chairman Han Guoliang Captured and Sent to Province <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The "Northwest Government" hidden in Zhulaxin Village, Tuoketuo County, Southwestern Sui, has recently been suppressed by the National Army's Sui South Command, Liu Wanchun. The chairman, Han Guoliang (nicknamed "Fortress Jade"), was also captured and escorted to Gui Sui. His five bodyguards also surrendered their weapons. It is reported that Zhu Village is located at the junction of Guisui, Salachi, and Tuoketuo counties, and the people are fierce. Han was originally a landlord who studied at Taiyuan School of Law and Politics. After returning to his hometown, he compiled his own Baojia and organized local militia. He also built a three-car bunker with a height of four Zhang and a thickness of five feet in the village. The people in the nearby seven or eight Bao all listened to his orders. When the Japanese invaded Guisui and Baotou, Han resisted for two years before fleeing south to the desert. After the victory, Han also returned to his hometown to resume his "Fortress King" life. He never paid grain to the government in his jurisdiction. The schools in the district did not use the national textbooks, but replaced them with his own "Book of Governing the Country and Pacifying the World." Last year, Tuo County sent more than 20 police officers to investigate the truth of the "Kingdom", and thousands of people under Han's rule beat them. Before the Lunar New Year, Yimeng Zhunqi was in distress. Liu Wanchun, commander of Southwestern Sui, fearing that Han would unite with the Communists, sent a team to suppress them and wiped them out in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] President Zhang gave instructions on loan policy at the meeting of the Joint Board on the 21st, which lasted for half an hour. Zhang first said that the business policy of each bank and bureau this year should be carefully planned based on the instructions of the chairman, and special attention should be paid to agricultural loans to meet President Chiang's intention to develop the rural economy. For general industrial and mining loans, the principle of grasping production or avoiding increasing currency issue should also be followed. Zhang especially emphasized that the loan policy should be coordinated with the ten self-help plans related to financial and economic reform proposed by himself, and should also be coordinated with the implementation methods in the economic reform plan. Regarding the raising of funds, Zhang advocated that in order to avoid increasing issuance, it is best for each bank and bureau to raise funds on their own. The Central Bank will no longer provide rediscount and re-mortgage in the future. In this way, loans and issuance are separated, and the issuance will not be increased due to national loans, causing the disadvantages of inflation. Because the above principles are still awaiting final approval by Chairman Chiang, no affirmative decision was made at the meeting on the 21st. Regarding the deposit of funds from various military and political agencies, President Zhang emphasized that the "Measures for the Deposit and Remittance of Funds for Military Agencies" promulgated by the National Treasury Department in October last year should be strictly implemented, and all funds should be deposited in the Central Bank. Because at present, various agencies are unable to do this, especially after public funds are withdrawn and remitted to other regions, the National Treasury Bureau often cannot control them, which has a negative impact. Therefore, it should be corrected.</p>

<p>New Development Expected in North China Situation</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 21st] A new development is expected in the stagnant situation in North China. The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters convened a unit commander conference in the western suburbs on the 21st. Senior unit commanders stationed in various places came to Beiping to participate. Commander Fan Hanjie and Hebei Province Chairman Chu Xichun also attended the meeting. From 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, in addition to reviewing the past, decisions were made on the development of military internal and external joint defense. Politics will follow the military to the countryside and take root in the newly opened areas. Retaliation is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Tianjin, 21st] In order to strengthen bandit suppression, the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters is planning to establish a new organizational structure in various levels of units. The main spirit of the new system is to give each unit two functions: one is a rapid force and the other is a garrison force. The two cooperate and are used flexibly.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 21st] Chen's 6th Column bandits, who invaded Lanfeng in eastern Henan, continued to attack the east, west, and north gates yesterday. The garrison resisted bravely, and the fierce battle is still in progress. In addition, Teng, the 10th Column bandit unit of Chen Yi's bandits, who fled south across the Longhai Railway, was strongly blocked by the National Army in Niuwangdui, north of Xiayi City, and Dahouji, west of the city, yesterday. The bandits suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and corpses were scattered everywhere. The remnants of the bandits fled south in a panic.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 21st] The remnants of Chen's bandit units, who fled back to southwestern Shandong, now total more than 50,000 people. Because of the National Army's fierce pursuit, more than 3,000 fled north across the Yellow River, and the rest are being encircled and suppressed by the National Army. The morale of the Communist bandits is declining, and they have no power to launch a major war.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] The number of accidents and the amount of losses on the Yuehan Railway after the restoration is worthy of attention. At about 6:00 pm on the 19th, the 15th passenger-freight mixed train from Shaozhou to Guangzhou derailed south of Shakou, damaging more than 200 meters of track, the roadbed collapsed, and several people were injured, but fortunately no one died. Six trains were damaged. The Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau has personally gone to the scene of the accident to investigate. Scheduled trains on the afternoon of the 20th were blocked.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] After the Battle of Anshan, there was great concern and regret here. The only thing that boosted the morale and spirit of the people here was the military's announcement: The naval fleet has entered Yingkou Port, where the river ice is just thawing. The garrison in Yingkou has been attacking and sweeping the surrounding bandits for days. The Benxi area, southeast of Shenyang, which is an important industrial and mining area, has recently been attacked by bandits. The bandits seem to have new plans. The bandits used a large force to cut off the railway traffic between Shenyang and Benxi. The Waitoushan Station between Sujiatun and Benxi is being attacked by the bandit army. The garrison there is a powerful team. As of the 21st, they have held out for 13 days. The air force flew to investigate and saw that the Waitoushan Station building and civilian houses were mostly in ruins, which shows the intensity of the battle. This battle fully demonstrates the fighting spirit of the defenders.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Pan Yang, 21st] The Battle of Anshan has caused the greatest damage to the steel industry in the Northeast. The national steel production plan will be changed, and the focus will be shifted to Central China, according to industrial sources. According to Shao Yizhou, General Manager of Angang Steel, Anshan is one of the few steel industries in the Far East. After the takeover, it actively resumed work, and the hope was great. If it is destroyed by bandits, the restoration project will be arduous and unimaginable, and it may not be allowed by the country's financial resources. More than 500 specialized technical personnel are trapped in the encirclement. They are loyal to their duties and are all rare talents. Shao regrets this endlessly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 21st] The National Army defending the iron capital Anshan has transferred to a new position after nine days and nights of hard fighting. After the bandits broke into the urban area on the 19th, they concentrated their artillery fire to attack our steel company. The northeastern highlands of the urban area and the Shahe Iron Bridge, Caowang Mountain and other positions were also violently attacked by the bandits. The defenders were in high spirits, charging back and forth, killing a large number of bandits. After obtaining a heavy price, they transferred to a new position according to the plan and continued fighting.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 21st] A major battle in western Liaoning is brewing. The Communist bandits gathered in Goubangzi and plan to cross the Daling River after the ice melts to threaten Jinzhou. It is reported that after the fierce battle near Shishan, it has become a vacuum zone. Powerful national troops are still based on the Daling River. Fan Hanjie's corps is still waiting for orders in the Jin-Yu section. If they cross the Daling River and advance to the east, they still need to increase their forces, because Li Yunchang's 9th Column of Communist bandits is also active in the Jin-Yu section to contain them.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Marshall's Testimony on Aid to China Before the House Foreign Affairs Committee - Full Text <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"When discussing aid to China, it should be clearly understood that the resolution of the China problem largely rests with the Chinese people themselves. The fundamental difficulty in determining the basis and procedures of an aid program lies in the military and economic situation in China. To date, the main obstacle to resolving China's economic problems has been the civil war. This civil war has depleted the Chinese government's domestic and foreign exchange resources, continuously damaged property, frequently disrupted economic life, and hindered recovery. The Communist forces have caused terrible destruction and harmed the Chinese economy, which is their declared aim—to force an economic collapse.</p>
<p>The Chinese government is currently in dire need of assistance amidst its severe economic difficulties. However, China's political, economic, and financial situation is so unstable and precarious that it is impossible to devise a practical, effective, and long-term overall economic recovery plan. Nevertheless, the United States government must provide assistance to China in its current dire situation to help delay the rapid deterioration of its economy, thereby giving it a breathing space and allowing the Chinese government to initiate important steps to achieve a more stable economy.</p>
<p>When considering this plan, there are multiple factors involved, and the following factors appear to be of greatest importance.</p>
<p>China is a vast country with a large population. North of the Yangtze River, transportation is almost non-existent, except for coastal navigation. Local governments are often deeply corrupt, and their assistance cannot be relied upon for administering relief measures. The political control of deeply entrenched groups poses a significant difficulty in restoring China's economic stability. The current civil war being waged, especially due to geographical disadvantages (exposed transportation and the length and difficulty of dealing with guerrilla warfare), requires a high level of proactive leadership at all levels of command, but in reality, such leadership is lacking. The civil war increases the national budget burden by more than 70%. Current financial measures rely entirely on issuing paper currency. Industrial production is low, and transportation equipment is deteriorating. The lack of transportation especially affects the delivery of food, resulting in rampant inflation and inevitable speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>In considering the measures the United States should take to aid China, I believe it is essential to note that aid to China cannot be compared to aid to Europe. It is not yet possible to predict when aid can be terminated. As for a fund to stabilize the currency, according to our currency experts, a very large amount is needed, and such a fund would be largely wasted while the current civil war is ongoing. In this situation, the aid plan to China should not include an actual guarantee of China's economic future. The United States' actions should not assume direct responsibility for the behavior of the Chinese government in its political, economic, and military affairs.</p>
<p>The proposed aid plan to China will provide $570 million in economic assistance until June 30, 1949. Of this, $510 million will include the minimum necessary import of civilian goods, mostly food and raw materials, and the remaining $60 million will be used for major construction projects. The aid plan focuses on various materials, which are believed to provide the maximum possible assistance to the Chinese civilian economy and ensure that every dollar has the greatest impact.</p>
<p>The total amount of China's import needs cannot be accurately estimated given the general instability of production and trade, as well as the chaotic conditions in some areas. Therefore, we believe that the items listed in the plan can be determined reasonably well. The plan will meet the requirements for the most needed commodities. Of course, China still needs other imports, including civilian goods and military supplies not included in the plan. In addition, China has some international financial burdens.</p>
<p>To meet these additional foreign exchange needs, China can use some of its own financial resources. These resources include income from exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, the sale of surplus property, and miscellaneous income from expenses incurred by foreign governments and charitable organizations in China. Finally, if necessary, there are China's gold and foreign exchange reserves, which were estimated to total $274 million as of January 1, 1948. This amount can be increased if China improves its net income in foreign exchange. On the other hand, this amount may be reduced if there are no other funds to be raised and the reserves must be used to cover payments due after January 1, 1948.</p>
<p>In the proposed plan, it is recommended that the plan be handled by an organization established according to law, as the establishment of such an organization is aimed at handling various foreign aid plans, or, before the establishment of such an organization, temporarily handled jointly by the State Department and other relevant government agencies. The various conditions for granting this assistance should be stipulated in an agreement signed with the Chinese government. These conditions will be considered in the same way as the conditions for granting assistance to European countries, but adjusted according to the different circumstances in China.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State Presents a Document Outlining the Economic Aid to China Plan</p>
<p>In addition to answering questions from the committee members during his testimony, Marshall presented a document outlining the "Economic Aid to China Plan." In addition to analyzing the materials recommended for delivery under the aid plan, the document discusses in detail the plan's administration and other terms, the facts of China's economic position, previous U.S. economic assistance, and China's promises of self-help.</p>
<p>The listed materials, in addition to cotton, grains, and kerosene products, include fertilizers, tobacco, metals, medicines, coal, and essential spare parts.</p>
<p>The outline states that since 1937, the U.S. government's aid to China has totaled $2.9058 billion, of which $1.4369 billion was after the victory over Japan, including Lend-Lease, the sale of surplus materials, UNRRA relief (the U.S. portion), U.S. foreign aid program funds, and loans from the Export-Import Bank.</p>
<p>Regarding possible construction projects, the outline also states that China has separately applied for loans of approximately $300 million from the Export-Import Bank, but notes: "Under China's current circumstances, the Export-Import Bank is unlikely to approve these applications, but some projects may be eligible for Export-Import Bank loans in the future." The outline states that "the main reason the Export-Import Bank has rejected previous applications is that the bank cannot find reasonable guarantees of repayment."</p>
<p>The bilateral agreement implementing the aid plan will authorize U.S. administrators to determine individual construction projects under the $60 million item. The administrators will also have the right to modify the list of quantities of materials to be delivered.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Final Stage of the Tokyo Tribunal <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Tokyo International Military Tribunal for the Far East's trial of Japanese war criminals has reached its final stage. At the 'final argument session' reopened on the ninth of this month, prosecutors and defendants each read their arguments and analyzed and reviewed all the evidence accepted by the court and the entire court record since the trial began 20 months ago, making their respective judgments. The defendants argued that the acts of war were based on self-defense and asked the court to acquit them. Chief Prosecutor Keenan, representing the prosecution team, vehemently attacked the defendants' fallacy of self-defense and loudly called for the death penalty for war criminals such as Tojo. The prosecutor's general indictment was completed on the 19th, and Keenan has returned to Washington, D.C., to return to Tokyo in a few weeks to hear the verdict. Now that the rebuttal stage between the prosecutors and defendants has ended, no more opinions can be expressed on the merits of the case. The next seven weeks will be a tense period for the judges' work. The weighing of each war crime and the decision of life and death are tied to the judges' votes and the drafting of the judgment. The importance of the Tokyo Tribunal is greater than the Nuremberg trials. The world is watching the outcome of the Tokyo Tribunal more closely than the Nuremberg trials. Our China has suffered the longest and greatest disaster from the invasion of Japanese warlords. We are concerned about the end of this major event and should express our opinions at this final crucial moment for the reference of the Far East Tribunal.</p>
<p>First, the issue of convicting Class A war criminals is based on the "Indictment of Japanese Class A War Criminals" by the United Nations prosecutors. The accused war criminals include 28 people, including Hideki Tojo and Doihara. Except for Yosuke Matsuoka and Osami Nagano, who died, and Shumei Okawa, who was exempted from prosecution due to mental illness, and escaped the "severe punishment" of Article 10 of the Potsdam Declaration, there are still 25 people. Since the secret trial began on May 3, 1946, until the end of the final argument stage, 21 months have passed. Exhaustive debates, cross-examinations, and individual justifications have given the defendants some favorable opportunities. They sit peacefully in Tokyo's Sugamo Prison, living a quiet life. Defense lawyers are creating "evidence of innocence" for them. Recently, the Tokyo Tribunal Research Association published "Hideki Tojo's Sworn Statement," a voluminous work of more than 200,000 words, which is popular among the Japanese people and still intends to win the final public opinion. Despite their sophistry, fabricating false evidence, and publishing fallacies, they cannot eliminate the facts of the blood debt and the verifiable evidence of crimes. The blood debts they owe to the world must be repaid and must be liquidated before justice. On February 11, Prosecutor Keenan accused these war criminals of launching wars of aggression, the greatest crime in the world, and conspiracy to violate peace. Their killings in the war of aggression are murder against humanity. If these crimes are not punished in this trial, the Potsdam Declaration will become a useless scrap of paper. We admire Keenan's righteous voice. We ask the judges of the court to accept the prosecutors' indictment and all the evidence of the crimes, and to pay attention to the trend of United Nations public opinion and quickly convict the Class A war criminals! Their crimes, first, are to undermine peace; second, to launch wars of aggression; and third, to violate humanity and have crimes of violating the laws and customs of war. According to jurisprudence and precedents, this group of criminals should be sentenced to death without mercy. If the crimes of these chief aggressors are of varying degrees of severity, and the majority or a minority go unpunished, the sacred law will be destroyed, and the highest moral standards that humanity adheres to will be separated, which will inevitably bring greater misfortune and disaster to the world situation and people's hearts. Therefore, we believe that in order to maintain the solemnity of the law and to implement the principle that "wars of aggression are crimes," we have the right to demand that this group of criminals be sentenced to death as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Second, the handling of unindicted war crime suspects. The Japanese war of aggression includes the "Mukden Incident," the Sino-Japanese War, and the Pacific War. Those who participated in the war preparation conspiracy and massacres include warlords, financial groups, bureaucrats, diplomats, and people involved in ideological culture. When General MacArthur landed in Tokyo, he arrested more than 100 war crime suspects in five batches. Most of the famous war criminals were arrested. Who knew that in the past two years, the prosecutors only filed public prosecutions against 28 people, including Tojo. The other criminals were not prosecuted. Some were released, and some were exempted from prosecution. Recently, Keenan again suggested to Washington, D.C. to release 20 war criminals, including many warlords with obvious crimes and bureaucrats who played an active role in the conspiracy to invade China, such as Nobusuke Kishi (Tojo's Minister of Commerce and Industry, one of the five rulers of "Manchukuo"), Kiichiro Higuchi (Commander of Rabaul), Shiro Nishio (Commander of the Japanese Army in China), Tada Hayao (Deputy Chief of the Army Staff), Yoshio Kodama (leader of the Kodama Zaibatsu in Shanghai), Tadasu Tani (Ambassador to the Wang puppet regime), and Teiichi Yoshimura (chief of the invading Chinese affairs). According to the February 16th news, Washington, D.C. has adopted Keenan's suggestion and will not interrogate Nishio and others. Not interrogating means "innocent," and "innocent" people are especially graced with release. We believe that this unilateral action is D'Artagnan. Our prosecutor Xiang Zhejun has objected and hopes that our government will take appropriate steps. We believe that the situation is urgent and request the Far East Tribunal and our government: first, at the end of the trial of Class A war criminals, the crimes of unindicted war criminals should be reviewed, and public prosecutions should be immediately continued so that war criminals with obvious crimes cannot escape the law; third, the unilateral release of war criminals should be protested, and any criminals who have committed crimes against peace and humanity in China should be requested to be extradited to China for trial according to law. We appeal to the Far East Tribunal and strive for the Far East Commission.</p>
<p>Third. Whether the Japanese Emperor should be regarded as a war criminal. The United Nations has very different opinions on whether Emperor Hirohito should be listed as a war criminal. According to the Potsdam Declaration: "The authority and power of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated." This clearly refers to the Japanese "Emperor." Later, when Japan surrendered, it requested that the "Emperor" not be harmed, and the United States agreed. Whether the Japanese government should adopt the "Emperor system," according to the interpretation of the Potsdam Declaration, should be decided freely by the Japanese people, but the spirit of Potsdam cannot explain that "the Emperor is innocent," and many long documents show that the "Emperor" participated in the invasion plan. The Far East Tribunal's general indictment says that the Emperor will not be held responsible for war crimes, which is doubtful. We have no retaliatory psychology towards the Emperor. When the world carefully filters this issue, the Allied countries must conduct a clear study of right and wrong. Gandhi said: "Facts are three-quarters of the law." Gandhi forgave his enemies and opponents, but he demanded that right and wrong be clarified and the truth be purified.</p>
<p>In short, the Tokyo Tribunal is nearing its final stage. We are waiting for the Far East Tribunal to complete the sentencing procedure for war criminals before the Japanese cherry blossoms bloom, punish the main culprits who incited the war and harmed humanity, establish peace for the world, and extend justice for humanity. This is our wish.</p>
<p>Power Plants in Northeast and North China Destroyed by Bandits - Heavy Losses of Major Electrical Equipment</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] According to the announcement of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, after the victory, the Power Industry Commission of our country made every effort to reorganize and repair the power industry, and the power generation has made rapid progress, and the future can be optimistic. Unfortunately, the main power equipment is distributed in the Northeast and North China regions, which have been devastated by the Communist bandits, resulting in heavy losses. According to statistics, since the Communist bandits initiated the rebellion, as of the end of January 1948, the situation of the factories being destroyed by the bandits is as follows:</p>
<p>Shimowei Power Plant</p>
<p>The two power plants of Weishui and Shimen, which belong to the plant, were occupied by the Communist bandits on April 12 and November 10, 1937, respectively. The Shimen Power Plant is equipped with a 2,000 kW unit, and the Weishui Power Plant is equipped with a 5,000 kW unit. All the transmission lines between Weishui and Shimen and the distribution user equipment in the two places were lost. The details of the damage are now being investigated.</p>
<p>Qingdao Power Plant</p>
<p>After the Boshan Power Plant of the Zhangbo Power Supply Area Management Office of the plant fell into the hands of the bandits in February 1937, the Communist bandits intended to destroy the power generation equipment. After the local employees in the plant begged, they were spared from destruction. Some materials have now been recovered, and the looted power lines have also been damaged.</p>
<p>Northeast Power Plant</p>
<p>(1) Songfu Transmission Line. The Fengman Hydropower Plant of the Bureau currently has equipment that can generate 135,000 kW, accounting for about 65% of the total power generation in the Northeast. Most of it was originally sent to Fushun through the Songfu 220,000-volt transmission line to supply the needs of the southern valley of the Northeast. In May 1937, the line was destroyed by the Communist bandits, and the losses were very heavy. Moreover, most of the areas through which it passes are still occupied by the bandits, and repair work cannot be carried out. At present, Fengman's electricity cannot be exported, and the southern part urgently needs electricity. The supply and demand cannot be met, which has a great impact on the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>(2) Xi'an Branch and Power Plant. In May 1937, the Communist bandits launched their fifth offensive. The transmission lines between Xi'an and Siping and Xi'an and Kaiyuan were destroyed by the bandits one after another. On June 2, fierce battles in the suburbs of the city resulted in 70 or 80 bullets hitting the power plant. The water tower and the speed regulators of three boilers and one steam turbine generator were damaged by bullets. Three 6,000 kVA transformers were also destroyed. On June 3, the power plant and branch were captured and have not been recovered.</p>
<p>(3) Andong Branch. After the Communist bandits retreated from Andong at the end of 1936, the Bureau sent personnel to take over the local power business. When the Communist bandits collapsed, the three 37.500 kVA main transformers and other equipment and houses in the Andong First Substation were completely destroyed and could not be repaired. In addition, the transformers, equipment and houses of the Second Substations of Sidaogou 6 and Daogou were also severely damaged. After the branch took over, it was reorganized and actively restored until it retreated again in early June 1937.</p>
<p>(4) Siping Branch was occupied by the Communist bandits on June 21, 1937, and was recovered by the National Army in August of the same year. All the factory buildings of the branch were destroyed; most of the materials were also looted; 70% of the distribution lines were lost; one employee was killed, two were injured, and 21 were missing.</p>
<p>Beipiao Power Plant was occupied by the Communist bandits on June 30, 1937. The guard team and some employees of the plant participated in the defense war. Three workers were killed heroically. The lines were also damaged. It was recovered in November 1937, and lost again in January this year.</p>
<p>Jibei Power Company</p>
<p>The Tianjin-Tangshan transmission line of the company was destroyed by the Communist bandits six times from February 20 to December 12, 1937, with a total loss of 644 power poles and a total line length of 28 kilometers and 700 meters.</p>
<p>In terms of substations, there are (1) Hangu Substation, which was attacked by the bandit army on the night of June 17. One transformer was destroyed and two were damaged. On the morning of September 29, the station was captured by the bandit army again. One transformer was destroyed, and the magnetic head glass of another transformer was shattered. (2) Changli Substation was completely burned by the bandit army on May 18.</p>
<p>Hainan Power Plant. The Dongfang Hydropower Plant of Hainan Power Plant has an original power generation capacity of 5,000 kW and a transmission line length of more than 90 kilometers. Because the plant is located 40 miles away from Beili City, Ganen County, its location is remote and transportation is inconvenient, resulting in the erratic appearance of Communist bandits. Employees are often looted, and equipment is often damaged. Since August 1936, the external transmission lines of the plant have been damaged and sold repeatedly, with more than 20 repairs. A total of more than 50 kilometers of lines and more than 400 poles have been destroyed, resulting in heavy losses and difficulty in repair. The remaining line materials in 1937 have been exhausted, and there is no ability to purchase more. Moreover, the Communist bandits have intensified the destruction of railways, and external power supply cannot continue to be maintained. It has been partially dismantled and stored. This unavoidable measure has a great impact on the development of Hainan's industry.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Detailed Program of US Aid to China <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) The document states that China can obtain the difference in commodity needs from regions such as Canada and the British Commonwealth. The US State Department believes that the rapid deterioration of China's economy is due to the impact of the civil war on materials, currency, and finance. The impact on materials includes the destruction and disconnection of transportation and industrial equipment, and the interruption of sources of raw materials, food, and fuel. The impact on finance and currency is inflation, which has caused the monthly banknote issuance rate to increase from 10% in 1946 to the current 25%, and the government budget requires 40 trillion Chinese legal tender yuan, of which 70% is for military purposes, resulting in the continued decline of China's exports and formal income, and the increasingly declining source of foreign exchange. The implementation of this plan will give China a slight surplus in foreign exchange income, which is expected to be used to improve currency reserves and purchase important military supplies (as Marshall reported today). According to the State Department's estimate, from April 1, 1948, to June 30, 1949, in addition to those supplied under the Aid to China plan, China will spend US$55 million in foreign exchange to obtain important imports (for importing chemicals, dyes, paper, wood pulp, wood, rubber, and rubber products, etc.), plus US$75 million in foreign exchange spent by the government (interest payments on loans, expenses for overseas diplomatic personnel, etc.), totaling US$130 million. On the other hand, the Chinese government's US dollar foreign exchange income is estimated to be between US$125 million and US$185 million (from exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, expenses of foreign governments and charitable organizations, and the sale of surplus property). According to the document, as of January 1 this year, the Chinese government held US$234 million in US currency or gold and US$40 million in British pounds, totaling US$274 million. In addition, China also holds silver worth US$30 million. It is estimated that private holdings of gold, foreign exchange, and long-term assets are at least US$500 million. According to statistics from the State Department, the United States has assisted China in various forms before the victory over Japan, totaling US$1.469.4 billion. Since the victory over Japan, aid to China has reached US$1.409 billion. On the other hand, since the victory over Japan, the Chinese government has spent more than US$700 million in foreign exchange. According to the ten-point reform plan for finance and economy announced by our Prime Minister Zhang Qun on January 28, it is also one of the appendices to the document.</p>
<h3 id="e23">US Further Reduces Gasoline Exports <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] US Secretary of Commerce Harriman has reduced the total amount of gasoline product exports for January, February and March of this year for the second time by 559,000 barrels. The previous reduction was on January 30, which reduced the originally scheduled total of 11.85 million barrels by 24%. In the revised list of amounts to be exported to the Far East (including China), the amount to be exported to China is 60,000 barrels of aviation motor fuel, 50,000 barrels of other motor fuel, 85,000 barrels of kerosene, and 100,000 barrels of gasoline and fuel oil.</p>
<h3 id="e24">The National Assembly's Concession Issue <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from Page One) The current issue has reached its final stage. The Minshe (Democratic Socialist) and Youth parties have issued statements expressing their attitudes. The Youth Party spokesman made three points: A, it is not a request for concessions, but a request to enforce national laws and party discipline; B, national laws should support party discipline, otherwise political parties will become ineffective; C, the Youth Party is not particularly interested in whether or not it is elected, but this is to fulfill its responsibility to the country. At the appropriate time, the Youth Party will issue a solemn statement to express its attitude. Yang Junming, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, said that it was regrettable that the Kuomintang could not truly implement cooperation. If the Kuomintang does not consider changing its methods, the Democratic Socialist Party will not participate in the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the constitution. Its formal written document will be announced after being approved by the party's Central Standing Committee. According to Hong Lanyou, the government is very willing to fulfill its political promises and implement concessions, but concessions should be based on a legal basis.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang dispatch dated 21st] The Kuomintang-nominated and regularly-elected National Assembly representatives from Jiangxi Province, who should make concessions to friendly parties, include nine counties: Jiujiang, Ganxian, Yichun, Dingnan, Xinyu, Linchuan, Jishui, Yiyang, and Yihuang. The issues in Dingnan and Xinyu have been resolved, and negotiations are underway for the others.</p>

<p>"Public Grain" Has Been Collected Up to September</p>
<p>[Our Jinan dispatch dated 21st] In the past two weeks, bandits in Jiaodong have been actively and forcibly collecting civilian grain. Whenever they obtain it, they load it onto sailboats in the southeast of Penglai and the northwest of Fushan, and secretly transport it to the Northeast to exchange for military supplies from a certain party. According to people from the bandit area, the bandits have already pre-collected this year's public grain up to September. The bandits feel very difficult about manpower and food, so they do not hesitate to drain the pond to catch all the fish, and search for the remaining grain among the people to exchange for military supplies.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Various Groups in Beiping Launch Blood Donation for the Wounded and Sick, Sending Shoes to Soldiers <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams to the Nation to Participate in the Grand Event</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping dispatch dated 21st] Various popular groups in Beiping recently decided to launch a widespread blood donation and shoe-sending campaign under the slogan "Everything for the National Army, Everything for the Front, Donate Blood to the Wounded Soldiers, Send Shoes to the Soldiers," in order to encourage and comfort the loyal and brave troops who are suppressing the rebellion to complete their task. It has been decided that the city will aim for 100,000 CC of blood and 100,000 pairs of military shoes, and will immediately mobilize citizens to take the lead in donating, and will send telegrams to the whole country, urging participation in the grand event. The telegram stated: After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, we have once again suffered a full-scale rebellion by traitors and bandits. The rehabilitation work cannot be advanced, and the national security is once again threatened. The government is mobilizing to suppress the rebellion and is rising up again to engage in a war to defend the country and safeguard the nation. Since the war zone is vast, there will be many casualties. During the Spring Festival this year, all sectors of Beiping went to the front line and various hospitals to comfort the troops, and personally witnessed the morale, deeply believing that victory can be grasped. However, the wounded soldiers need blood transfusions, and the front line lacks cloth shoes. Considering that the soldiers suppressing the rebellion are truly national revolutionary soldiers who are protecting the country's territorial sovereignty, it is not only our compatriots in the rear's inescapable duty to provide money and effort to supply the front, but also our unswerving duty. After deliberation by all sectors of the city, we will transfuse 100,000 CC of blood to the wounded soldiers in Beiping and donate 100,000 pairs of military shoes to the soldiers on the front line. The compatriots in this city should take the lead in practicing this, and immediately formulate a plan to effectively promote it. We hope that all sectors of the country, regardless of age or location, will rise up together and launch two major campaigns of blood donation and shoe donation in their respective localities, so that the wounded and sick officers and soldiers can fulfill their wish to return to the front line, and the soldiers on the front line can increase their courage. With the cooperation of the military and civilians, we can complete the task of suppressing the rebellion.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou dispatch dated 21st] After the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the security along the line has become increasingly serious. Communist bandits are lurking, not only harassing the local area, but also attempting to destroy traffic. Chairman Shen made a special trip to Jiahu, and after completing the key tasks of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, he went to Qu County via Jinhua this morning with Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Zhu Mingtao, Director of the Police and Security Department, and Staff Officer Wang of the Military Officer District.

<h3 id="e34">Minister Li Weiguo Speaks on International Issues, the International Outstanding Issues Are the Treaty of Peace with Germany, and the Treaty with Japan is Relatively Simple <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing dispatch dated 21st] Minister Li Weiguo of the Central Propaganda Department gave a lecture on "International Issues" at the invitation of the Cold Holiday Lecture Meeting for faculty and staff of secondary and higher schools, jointly organized by the Chinese Education Society and the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau, in the auditorium of Jinling University on the morning of the 21st. Li believes that the outstanding issues that need to be resolved urgently in the current international community are the peace treaty with Germany, and the opinions of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have not yet been consistent. In terms of compensation, Britain, the United States, and France all advocate preserving a portion of Germany's remaining means of production, so as to maintain the German people's minimum standard of living and gradually increase production to compensate the Allied countries, while the Soviet Union has not considered the consequences of this matter, and insists that the remaining means of production must be completely transferred for compensation. France has been invaded by Germany three times in seventy years and does not want to see Germany have a dictatorial centralized government again, while the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to fully support the establishment of a centralized German government. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union has cultivated the German Communist Party into the most powerful political party in the past few years. Once Germany is out of Allied control, the Communist Party will be able to control the entire Germany. In addition, the border issue is also an obstacle to the signing of the peace treaty. After the Soviet Union seized the swampy area in eastern Poland, it allocated the area east of the Oder River in Germany to Poland as compensation. Of course, the latter has rich forest resources and an industrial base, but the residents are all Germans, and their living habits, traditional culture are completely different from those of the Poles, while the residents of the swampy area are all Poles, so they have lost their motherland. As for the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, Li believes that it is simpler than the German peace treaty, but the voting method has become a major dispute. The Soviet Union advocates that the discussion should be held by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, while Britain says that the discussion should be held by the Far East Commission, which is composed of eleven countries, and a two-thirds majority would have the right to vote. We must know that the Philippines, Canada, Australia, and other countries among these eleven countries are actually the same as Britain and the United States, so it is difficult to expect the opinions of China and the Soviet Union to be valued, because they can only occupy two votes.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Li also commented on international economic issues and international cultural issues, and emphasized that communist culture violates human nature, and that building the ideological foundation of Marx on the philosophy of hatred is too unwise.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou dispatch dated 21st] He Yushu, director of the Suzhou Provincial Department of Field Grain, arrived in Suzhou this afternoon to inspect grain administration, and met with County Magistrate Wang to instruct him on how to deal with the grain issue. When the reporter visited and asked about measures to suppress grain prices, he said: The current rise in grain prices is mostly due to human factors, so the county government has been ordered to persuade grain merchants to sell their stored grain. If the stocks are insufficient, the government can sell the grain allocated for tax purposes. At the same time, it is also planned to ask the Ministry of Food to allocate a large batch of rice for distribution and sale, so that grain prices will no longer rise, in order to reassure the people.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou dispatch dated 21st] It is rumored that the recent rise in Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou was caused by private schools using all their tuition fees to purchase Hong Kong dollars, which stimulated the market and led to a crazy rise. The principals of various private schools have issued a statement stating that the private schools only have 20,000 students, and the total tuition revenue is only 100 billion. Even if foreign currency is purchased, the amount is not large enough to stimulate the market. In addition, the private schools have rejected the Guangzhou Education Bureau's suggestion to deposit the fees into the bank, believing that this move is also difficult in practice.</p>

<p>[Washington, D.C., U.S. Information Service, 20th] On the 20th, the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee devoted most of its interrogation time to discussing China's military needs. Representative Judd (Republican from Minnesota) urged expanding military aid to China and sending a military advisory delegation to China. Marshall pointed out that during his time in China as President Truman's special envoy, he constantly provided advice to the Chinese government on how to improve its combat forces. He emphasized the importance of providing thorough training before incorporating these troops into combat divisions.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State declared: "There has been no shortage of advice, and it has been constantly and diligently offered—but it has been ignored."</p>
<p>When asked if the aid to China plan was an amendment to the European Recovery Program, Marshall said: "No, this is an important situation that the United States must face, while the European Recovery Program is a complete entity in itself. When considering the European Recovery Program, we are dealing with one situation; when considering aid to China, we are dealing with an entirely different situation."</p>
<p>Marshall stated: European countries have a solid foundation to build upon, but the situation in China is extremely chaotic, and no one can predict the future.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Mente stated: The State Department should have a "strong" foreign policy to complement aid to China and aid to Europe. The Secretary of State supported this view, stating: The primary goal of the State Department is "certain individual freedoms."</p>
<p>He continued: "I do not think we are standing still; I think we are moving forward."</p>
<p>Smith asked: Does the Secretary of State believe that the committee should study Wedemeyer's report on aid to China? The Secretary of State answered, "No." He did not wish to express an opinion on the suggestion that Allied Supreme Commander in Japan, General MacArthur, be recalled from Tokyo to testify before the committee. Some committee members seemed to support this proposal. When asked what reforms he thought the Chinese National Government should implement, Marshall answered: He believed that the foundation of the Chinese government must be broadened and not limited to a small group. "In particular, I believe the National Government should take action on the land situation and the farmers' problems, creating a feeling among the lower classes that the government is not neglecting them or their problems."</p>
<p>He stated: China's military hardware is far less important than the quality of leadership and the morale of the people.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Lodge asked: Should a new conference be held regarding the issue of Japanese reparations? The Secretary of State stated: The current agreement should be reconsidered because it may hinder the resolution of the entire issue.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State pointed out that the situation in China had caused concern at various times. In August 1946, he suggested that the U.S. Export-Import Bank study the possibility of development loans to China. Marshall added: "But at that time, the situation in China was such that the bank felt it could not provide loans."</p>
<p>Representative Kee (Democrat from West Virginia) inquired whether the aid currently under consideration could "reach the Chinese people, given that this aid is intended for the Chinese people." The Secretary of State replied: "He believes it can be achieved; we can reasonably hope that the plan will be implemented and that the goods can reach the people for whom they are intended."</p>
<p>The Secretary of State stated: Many of the past delays in supplying weapons to the Chinese government were due to the Chinese authorities' delay in making various arrangements.</p>
<p>Representative Vorys (Republican from Ohio) pointed out that Congress has a feeling that any action on China may be either too early or too late.</p>
<p>Marshall replied: "In my view, certain fundamental work must be done before our aid can be effective. In this sense, aid is still too early. On the other hand, the situation there is rapidly deteriorating, and we must consider the possibility that we cannot achieve anything without wasting funds." The Secretary of State stated: There are many things the Chinese government could do that it has not done, namely, politically satisfying the people, and militarily not only responding to the advice of our senior military strategists but also responding to the advice of their own senior officers. Vorys asked whether the situations in Greece and China could be equated. Marshall replied: The situations are very different. He explained that in China, "we have an army that has been fighting the government for quite some time. In Greece, we have an aggressive force supported by neighboring countries. There is no evidence that the communist army is receiving aid from outside China."</p>
<p>The Secretary of State agreed with Representative Smith (Republican from Wisconsin) that the situation in China could endanger U.S. national security. Marshall stated: The State Department hopes that a stable China can be established, but this involves military, political, and economic factors that still need to be formed.</p>
<p>Marshall disagreed with Smith's opinion that the Chinese Northeast had been acquired by the Communists. He stated: He did not want to create the impression that the National Government forces would suddenly reverse the situation against the Communist forces, but he indicated that he did not believe the situation in the Northeast was as critical as some people portrayed.</p>

<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 21st] Hitoshi Ashida, President of the conservative Democratic Party of Japan, was elected Japan's fifth Prime Minister since the war on the afternoon of the 21st. Ashida stated that he plans to form a center-left coalition cabinet on the 23rd. Ashida, 60 years old, previously served as Foreign Minister in the Katayama cabinet. It is expected that MacArthur will approve of his leadership. Ashida was elected with 216 votes in the 421-seat House of Representatives. Outgoing Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama announced that he would not run, and his Social Democratic Party ultimately switched to supporting Ashida. Ashida's political rival, former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida of the Liberal Party, received 180 votes. Katayama received eight votes, Communist Party leader Tokuda received three votes, and there were 14 invalid votes. In two rounds of voting in the House of Councillors, Yoshida held an advantage, but did not reach the required majority. However, the vote in the House of Representatives is decisive, so it is expected that the House of Councillors will take unified action on the evening of the 21st or the 22nd. Ashida issued a statement afterward, saying that he would invite leaders of various parties on the 23rd to discuss policy agreements. He does not intend to visit the Emperor for the investiture ceremony until the cabinet is organized. Because Ashida is heavily dependent on the Social Democratic Party, the new cabinet is expected to be largely the same as the previous cabinet. Political observers have already predicted that key economic positions have been decided to be filled by the Social Democratic Party. Because the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party unexpectedly supported Ashida, it is rumored that left-wing Social Democrat Kato will be appointed Minister of Labor. If this is the case, then the new cabinet will be almost entirely the same as the previous cabinet, with the Social Democratic Party holding significant power, the only difference being that the Prime Minister is a member of the Democratic Party. Ashida was a classmate of Katayama's when he studied at the Imperial Hosei University. Before the war, he was the president of the English-language "Japan Times and Mail." He is fluent in English and French, which Katayama himself admits he cannot match. Ashida also served as a Kyoto district councilor and was stationed in Turkey and Belgium. It is said that the Allied Headquarters has a very good impression of him. When Ashida was Foreign Minister, he caused a great uproar when he announced that he hoped Okinawa and neighboring Japanese islands could be returned to Japan when the peace conference was convened. However, he later claimed that this was a misunderstanding of the reports. Ashida has recently been criticized by political opponents, who say that he wrote articles for the Japan Times and Mail before the war advocating aggression, and should therefore be purged. It is generally believed that the new cabinet will face a difficult future. Because of inflation, lack of resources, and other economic problems, Katayama resigned, and Ashida will be very hesitant.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, New Asia News Agency, 21st] After Democratic Party President Ashida was nominated as the next Prime Minister in the House of Representatives, he met with the press for the first time and said: "I am very grateful to have been elected Prime Minister of the Cabinet at today's plenary session of the House of Representatives, despite my limited abilities. I will serve the country with utmost sincerity. I plan to visit the leaders of various parties next week to ask for their cooperation and discuss policies. As for the specific date next week, it has not yet been decided. I am not willing to say much about my opinions for the time being, but I hope to overcome the current crisis with the cooperation and assistance of the people."</p>
<p>[Tokyo, New Asia News Agency, 21st] House of Representatives Speaker Matsuoka and House of Councillors Vice-Speaker entered the Imperial Palace tonight on behalf of the Diet to report to the Emperor that Ashida had been nominated as the next Prime Minister of the Cabinet and notified both houses of the Diet in writing. Therefore, Ashida has been confirmed as Prime Minister. However, Ashida's investiture ceremony with the Emperor is scheduled to be held at the same time as the certification ceremony after the ministers have been decided. Starting next week, Prime Minister Ashida will use the Democratic Party headquarters as the cabinet formation headquarters. It is expected that the four-party coalition will be the fundamental policy. A policy agreement meeting will be held with the leaders of the Liberal, Socialist, and Cooperative parties to first seek policy consensus and then select cabinet members.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Pacific Allies Unanimously Oppose U.S. Rebuilding Japanese Economy, Deeply Fear Japan's Resurgent Aggression Threatening Peace <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 20th] The U.S. plan to rebuild the Japanese economy and save the country from bankruptcy has strained the postwar common front of the Allied countries in the Pacific. The United States hopes that Japanese commerce will recover and become self-sufficient. Other Allied countries do not agree. Some countries believe that if Japan becomes strong again in the world market, it will threaten the economies of other countries in the Pacific. Others believe that after Japan re-industrializes, it will embark on a path of militarism again, endangering world peace. The Philippines and Australia hold this view, and China is also believed to hold this view.</p>
<p>By mid-month, Foreign Minister Wang had issued a statement with views closer to those of the United States. But other sectors of the Chinese government and public refused to accept this new stance. In the Southwest Pacific, there is also unease about the United States protecting Japan. The Malayan Federation, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies have not forgotten the pain of the Japanese military's iron heel. The newly independent Burma and the British dominions of Pakistan and India can be said to share the same views. The opinions of all these countries are increasingly at odds with the U.S. financial aid to Japan. The report from Tokyo that the United States plans to implement a one billion dollar aid to Japan plan within four years has not been fully confirmed here, but it is possible. Since the United States occupied Japan, it has spent more than 300 million dollars each year, and commercial loans are just beginning. The U.S. Department of the Army is opening up other sources of funding for Japan. Congress is considering a 150 million dollar U.S. cotton shipping bill to Japan. The Federal Supply Bureau will spend 285 million dollars in Japan this year, and it seems that it will spend 360 million dollars next year. The Department of the Army also hopes to establish barter arrangements.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 21st] It is reported that, according to the policy currently being drafted, the Japanese government needs foreign loans and investment, but hopes to avoid "speculative" money. The basic policy for dealing with this matter is being studied by the Trade and Foreign Loan Committee of the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board. Allied businessmen and potential investors in Japan are closely watching the final development of this matter. According to Japanese sources, a "concrete policy" will be adopted soon, with the following key points: (1) Speculative investment should be rejected; (2) Investment should be accompanied by the import of raw materials; (3) The import of raw materials unrelated to economic recovery should be restricted; (4) Religious, cultural, tourism, and research projects should be encouraged as much as possible. Japanese government officials believe that foreign exchange transactions will be temporarily controlled, as commerce and loans are still under control. It is believed that this matter will change after the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The current controls are in fact stipulated by the Allied forces. The Japanese are now studying how to control foreign exchange if the Japanese government orders it to do so.</p>

<p>[Paris, Agence France-Presse, 20th] The French government sent a response today to the Soviet Union's protest against the meeting of France, the United States, and the United Kingdom in London, stating that France did not sign the Potsdam Agreement and is therefore not bound by this agreement. The only document France has signed is to urge countries related to the German problem to consult. The French government's consistent position is that the four governments should maintain a consistent attitude. Now that the London Conference has failed, the French government has no choice but to consult with the United Kingdom and the United States to find a solution to this major problem of European recovery.</p>

<p>[Berlin, Reuters, 20th] The U.S. military government announced that experts from the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have reached an agreement in Berlin on the three major issues of the Saar's integration into the French economic system, namely coal, France's share of reparations, and trade between the Saar and the British and American zones. The agreement stipulates that from April 1, trade between the Saar and West Germany will be regarded as foreign trade, but the Saar's supply of coal to Germany will still be paid in Marks as in the past.</p>
<p>Business relations between the French occupation zone and the British and American zones have been reviewed, and the current trade agreement will be revised in accordance with the new situation. Trade in 1948 will still be based on the Mark, but a joint committee will be established to constantly monitor the development of trade. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that France, in view of the new deployment regarding the Saar, has agreed to reduce France's reparations demands from Germany, which were originally set at 70 million Marks based on the 1938 Mark exchange rate. When asked whether the Saar Agreement established in Berlin was a precursor to the French zone joining the British-American merger zone, the spokesman said that he did not believe that the three zones would be merged as a result.</p>

<p>[Berlin, United Press, 20th] General Clay told the Allied Control Council for Germany that he had heard many rumors indicating that the Soviet Union was still maintaining much of Germany's war potential. He said: "I dare not say that the rumors we have heard are indeed facts. It is said that there are still shipyards in Rostock and other places building warships, Saxony is mining uranium, and there are orders requiring factories in the U.S. zone to manufacture precision instruments for the Soviet zone. Although this is only a rumor, this rumor is also sufficient to hinder the harmony of the four countries on the demilitarization of Germany."</p>

<p>[The Hague, Reuters, 20th] The Dutch news agency said: According to well-informed sources, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have jointly submitted a memorandum to the United Kingdom and France on the Bevin Western European alliance plan, suggesting the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty against aggression. The memorandum was personally delivered by Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak to the British chargé d'affaires and the French ambassador to Belgium. In the memorandum, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also rejected the British and French proposal to extend the Dunkirk Treaty between the United Kingdom and France to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, pointing out that this action is not sufficient to guarantee full protection. The anti-aggression mutual assistance treaty proposed by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is similar in nature to the Pan-American Mutual Assistance Treaty signed in Brazil last year. The treaty stipulates that if one or more of the signatory countries is subjected to aggression, the other signatory countries must provide each other with military, political, and economic assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e57">International Diplomatic War in Europe <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— By Our European Correspondent Zhongxi</p>
<p>Since the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in London last winter ended in discord without any results, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall returned to Washington and immediately urged Congress to promptly pass his European Recovery Program without any reduction. British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in January that he would abandon the Labour Party's long-standing foreign policy of bridging the gap between the United States and the Soviet Union and resolutely proposed the Western European alliance plan. After French Foreign Minister Bidault returned to France, he helped the government rectify its internal affairs and ordered all foreign suspects who incited the French general strike to be deported. After Molotov returned to the Soviet Union, in addition to proposing a reduction in reparations demands from Austria, seemingly intending to reopen negotiations with the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, he recently instructed the Soviet Commander to publicly criticize the U.S. for mistreating Soviet soldiers at the meeting of the Allied Control Council in Berlin. At the same time, he also submitted a barrage of protest letters to the U.S. Department of State. The first said that the United States should not use the Mellaha Air Base in Libya; the second said that the U.S. Navy should not stay in Italian ports, pointing out that this act violated the treaty with Italy; the third said that the U.S. Air Force should not hover over Soviet ships in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea to conduct reconnaissance; and the fourth said that U.S. telecommunications personnel should not assist the Iranian government in building the northern border defense. The U.S. has refuted all Soviet protests one by one, denying any improper behavior.</p>
<p>All of the above tells us that the gap between Eastern and Western countries is widening, and the division is becoming more apparent.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's observation, the Soviet Union's strategy is to strive for victory without war, using methods such as undermining from below and direct attack in tandem. Its purpose is of course to compete with the United States for hegemony. The Soviet Union's protest has the realistic effect of preemptively striking, indicating that the Soviet Union is not afraid of the United States, but in reality, its true effect is to create a sense of shared hatred of the United States among the Soviet people, cultivating a future backing for the Soviet military's actions. From the point of cursing America and protesting America, it can be said that peace between the United States and the Soviet Union can still be temporarily secured, but it cannot be denied that both sides are preparing for war, and are therefore one step closer to war.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Western European alliance, it was first proposed by former British Prime Minister Churchill. After the British Labour Party came to power, it was unwilling to adopt Churchill's policy. Even now, the British Labour Party still opposes the Western European federal movement led by Churchill. But after the failure of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference last winter, forced by reality, the British Labour Party Foreign Minister had no choice but to adopt this strategy due to the trend of the times. Recently, British Minister of State McNeil personally went to Brussels to lobby the foreign ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, hoping that all countries would voluntarily sacrifice their rights and interests to join this alliance, so as not to be enslaved by any totalitarian country again. It is heard that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have expressed their support for Bevin's proposal, but still hold a reserved attitude, requesting that the United Kingdom and France first show the detailed content of the plan, and at the same time hope that the three countries can have a say in the British and French-controlled parts of West Germany. On the northern front, Sweden has formally stated that it cannot join, but is willing to continue to maintain neutrality. Denmark also wants to follow Sweden's position, expressing detachment. Switzerland has not expressed anything, and may still maintain neutrality. If the Communist Party in Italy cannot gain momentum, it is mostly hoped that it will join. Everything will still depend on the degree of cooperation between the United Kingdom and France as a prerequisite for success. The number of countries currently conducting the Western European alliance and those accepting the Marshall European Recovery Program is in a ratio of one to three. It is estimated that only five or six countries will join the Western European alliance, while sixteen countries have accepted the Marshall European Recovery Program. It is obvious that the political combination among Western European countries will be ten to a hundred times more difficult than their economic cooperation, and even if Foreign Minister Bevin's Western European alliance plan can be promoted, its progress will inevitably be extremely slow. It is still doubtful whether it can truly achieve the goal of preventing the Soviet Union from advancing westward, because the languages and traditions of Western European countries are different from each other. It is not easy to integrate them immediately. However, judging from their past history, although it is not easy for them to share happiness, they are often able to share difficulties, and their spirit of independence is extremely strong, so even if a strong country can quickly annex them, it is also very difficult to digest them.

<p>[Prague, Reuters, 20th] Eight non-Communist cabinet members of the Czech coalition government resigned tonight, and the dissolution of the Czech Constituent Assembly and the re-election of a new parliament are expected. Prime Minister Gottwald (Communist) today visited President Beneš and submitted the resignation of the entire cabinet. However, Beneš instructed them to continue in office until the general election. Beneš also received non-party Defense Minister Svoboda, Communist Interior Minister Nosek, and People's Party cabinet member Hala.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party Executive Committee today passed a resolution demanding the continuation of the coalition cabinet, opposing a non-party government or a majority cabinet of the Communist Party and Social Democratic Party. The Communist Party's declaration regarding the political turmoil stated that the National Socialist Party, the Czech Socialist Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party formed an anti-socialist bloc within the People's Front organization, determined to undermine the cabinet's plans and achievements, hoping that the socialist parties would support the People's Front, save the Gottwald cabinet, and maintain friendship with other Slavic countries. The first to resign today were Czech Socialist Party cabinet members Deputy Prime Minister Dinger, Justice Minister Tedina, and another cabinet member, Stransky. The three People's Party cabinet members, Deputy Prime Minister Slameček, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Hala, and Minister of Health Prochazka, followed suit. Then, the two Slovak Democratic Party cabinet members, Deputy Prime Minister Kožala and Minister of Transportation Bido, also submitted their resignations to Gottwald. The cause of this cabinet crisis is that the Czech Socialist Party, National Socialist Party, and People's Party accused Communist Interior Minister Nosek of defying cabinet decisions and "reddening" the Ministry of Interior, especially key positions in the police department.</p>
<p>Czech Mass Rally Endorses Communist Prime Minister</p>
<p>[Prague, Agence France-Presse, 21st] Czech Prime Minister Gottwald declared today at a Communist Party-led mass rally, "Reactionary elements at home and abroad are plotting to turn our country into a base for foreign secret agents to carry out conspiracies harmful to the republic and against the Soviet Union." Gottwald continued, "We are determined never to hand over police power to reactionary elements," and called on Czechs and Slavs to "exercise strict vigilance to curb any conspiracy by reactionary elements." Subsequently, the mass rally enthusiastically passed a resolution stating, "We strongly demand that President Beneš accept the resignations of the three-party cabinet members. We only need a cabinet led by Gottwald and do not need cabinet members from the reactionary faction." According to members of parliament, according to constitutional provisions, the president has the right to refuse the resignation of cabinet members, order the cabinet to continue to exercise its powers, and may order a general election of members of parliament within six weeks without the need for an election campaign. It is not yet known what President Beneš will decide.</p>
<p>Communist Interior Minister Announces Discovery of Reactionary Conspiracy</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 20th] Prague Radio reported that Czech Interior Minister Nosek and Defense Minister Svoboda issued a joint announcement, announcing the discovery of a conspiracy for an armed coup. This conspiracy was uncovered last week during an investigation into Czech Socialist Party newspaper allegations that anti-state elements were serving in the government. The leader was a former subordinate of General Prgucela, who was dismissed from military service in 1945. Their leader, Rielia, had contact with former Polish Expeditionary Force General Anders' subordinates. They colluded with Ukrainians to collect Czech military intelligence and supply it to a foreign country, and distributed reactionary propaganda, preparing for an armed coup. Because this case concerns the safety of important Czech figures and is related to a certain allied country, it is being kept strictly secret.</p>

<p>[London, Reuters, 20th] A British Foreign Office spokesman announced that when the four-power foreign ministers' representatives met here today to discuss the Austrian peace treaty, the representatives had a significant consensus on the principles of the Austrian peace treaty. Today's meeting was chaired by the British representative, who welcomed the new Soviet proposals regarding German assets in Austria and believed that these Soviet and French proposals could be the basis for a satisfactory solution. He also solemnly stated, "If an agreement is not reached this time, Austria will not obtain a peace treaty for many years. Our goal is to establish an independent Austria. We must not ignore other points in the treaty, such as borders, reparations, and military clauses." French representative Cherrière stated that the French government's goals are the same as those of Britain and the United States, namely to rebuild a free and independent Austria capable of self-reliance. Soviet representative Koktomov also stated that the Soviet Union agreed with the opinions of other delegations and recognized the importance of reaching a solution to the Austrian problem. Koktomov also said that the new Soviet proposals are more advanced than the Soviet Union's original position on German assets in Austria. The foreign ministers' meeting has agreed that the German assets issue is the main problem to be addressed and should be reviewed before other issues. The meeting then discussed the first two chapters of the Soviet proposal. The first chapter stipulates that the Soviet Union should acquire 25% of the Austrian Danube Shipping Company's property rights and all property rights in countries south of Austria; the second chapter stipulates that Austria must pay the Soviet Union freely convertible currency worth US$200 million within two years.</p>

<p>Call Me Commander-in-Chief, Not President</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war, our armed forces went to the front lines under the command of the President as Commander-in-Chief, but diplomatic work also became an important factor in the war. Relations with enemy countries had certainly ceased, but relations with allies and neutral countries became more and more complicated, making our work much more burdensome.</p>
<p>In peacetime, the State Department is responsible for handling international relations and also provides advice on the deployment of our country's overseas troops, such as whether our troops stationed in China should be increased or decreased. When the war came, the State Department no longer had any involvement in overseas military operations, as it was now solely under the command of the appropriate military authorities.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after the Pearl Harbor incident, I told my colleagues that from now on, the State Department's task was to contribute to the war effort, expressing the hope that everyone in the State Department would fully cooperate and provide all conveniences to the Army Department, the Navy Department, and all war-related agencies.</p>
<p>It became a habit for me not to allow State Department officials to come to me and say that a certain official in the Army Department or Navy Department had done something wrong. I told them, "Remember, they are responsible for strategy and executing the war. They have the right to our fullest cooperation."</p>
<p>Before the Pearl Harbor incident, I was a member of the military conference, which included the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Naval Operations. I participated in every meeting. After the Pearl Harbor incident, I no longer attended meetings related to military matters. This was because the President did not invite me to attend these meetings. I raised this issue with him several times. In my opinion, in many important aspects, the Secretary of State should attend the President's military meetings, especially meetings of a combined military-diplomatic nature, for obvious reasons, because very few large-scale military operations do not involve diplomatic aspects.</p>
<p>I felt that it was a major mistake for the Secretary of State not to attend important military meetings. I often had the opportunity to point out to the President that a certain military development undoubtedly decided in these meetings also had its major diplomatic relations, and I should have been informed at the time.</p>
<p>The President did not take me to the Casablanca, Cairo, or Tehran conferences, which were mainly of a military nature. I also did not participate in the military discussions he held with Prime Minister Churchill in Washington, some of which had a broad impact on the diplomatic side. I said to him, "I am not trying to increase my responsibilities, but I believe the Secretary of State should attend these meetings." I mentioned the British method, which is that Foreign Secretary Eden attends all military meetings. The President's reply was that we have a different system here. I agreed that this was the case. The British cabinet forms the government, and Eden has stronger reasons to attend military meetings under their system than I do under our system, even though the various aspects of diplomacy are also important factors worth considering.</p>
<p>I learned about what happened in the Casablanca, Cairo, and Tehran conferences from sources other than the President. I did not have a special opportunity to ask Mr. Roosevelt about the developments of these meetings, but if I asked him about the issues he discussed, then, with a few exceptions, he would always frankly tell me the most confidential things.</p>
<p>One military matter that I had discussed with the President and his military aides was the location of the second front. I agreed that our main effort should be to cross the English Channel to France. As for where the troops would land and what route the Allied forces would take across the continent in the major military operation to conquer Hitler, I never discussed it with the President or any other senior military officials, although I had learned of the decision that had already been reached. Regarding the atomic bomb, no one told me. Occasionally, someone would give me a vague hint, but I did not press for an answer. I didn't really know about it until it was dropped and announced. In the last few months of its preparation and at the time of its dropping, I was no longer the Secretary of State, so I wouldn't have known anything. Mr. Roosevelt's foresight in deciding to spend two billion dollars to develop the atomic bomb is indeed worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The President continued not to invite me to his military meetings. He loved the military side of the big picture and liked to keep it in his own hands. After the Pearl Harbor incident, he liked to be called Commander-in-Chief more than the title of President. He was happy to use this title. He may have felt that this extremely important position was now more necessary than the President.</p>
<p>At a cabinet dinner, around 1942, I prepared to raise my glass in a toast. Before I stood up to speak, the President asked me:</p>
<p>"Please call me Commander-in-Chief, not President."</p>
<p>When I talked to ambassadors from various countries, especially representatives of our major allies, it was of course impossible not to mention certain military topics. In December 1941, when I had my first conversation with the new Soviet ambassador, Litvinov, I raised a question asking the Soviet Union to allow us to use air bases on Soviet territory in order to bomb Japanese areas. We also discussed the issue of using Soviet ships to transport supplies to Vladivostok, because Japan would obviously not allow American ships to transport them to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Litvinov was the former Soviet Foreign Minister, and I had previously conducted preliminary negotiations with him, resulting in the establishment of US-Soviet diplomatic relations in 1933. Three days later, when Litvinov came to see me at my request, he said that his government had informed him that it did not believe it could cooperate with us against Japan at that time. He said that the Soviet Union was engaged in a large-scale war against Germany and could not risk attacking Japan.</p>
<p>I replied that I could understand the Soviet Union's position. I mentioned to him that at the beginning of this year, we had provided the Soviet Union with warnings about Germany's impending attack, and said that I now had the same reliable information, namely that Japan, regardless of the provisions of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, had the strictest obligations to Germany, and would attack the Soviet Union and any other country at war with Germany when Hitler requested it. I also said that the plan seemed to be that Japan would attack the United States first, with Germany and Italy joining in, and then, when Germany requested it, Japan would invade the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Although Stalin had decided not to join us against Japan at that time, I still kept this issue before him for quite some time.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war, the work of the State Department changed or intensified in many ways.</p>
<p>In order to exchange diplomatic personnel and civilians with the Axis powers, we were also engaged in negotiations, which consumed several months. A few days after the Pearl Harbor incident, while the State Department was holding a meeting on this issue, we received information from a very reliable source that Japanese Ambassador Nomura and his naval attaché had received orders to commit seppuku in the embassy so that the Japanese government could say that we had assassinated them.</p>
<p>If this plan had been realized, we were very worried about how the Japanese officials would treat us. We asked the Swiss minister to immediately go to the Japanese embassy, inform Nomura of the information we had received, and determine his intentions. They talked for a long time, but they could not completely dispel our fears, because Nomura said that the decision was not up to him, but to higher authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Regulations on Deferred Conscription for National Defense Technical Workers; Cannot Rely Solely on Registration Certificates Issued by the Labor Bureau; City's Conscription of 6,000 May Adopt Lottery System <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of deferred conscription for national defense technical workers, most industry workers believe that holding a technical worker registration certificate issued by the Labor Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs is sufficient for deferred conscription. The Ministry of National Defense believes that the scope of eligibility is too broad, and recently issued four restrictions on deferred conscription, which the Ministry of Social Affairs ordered the city's Bureau of Social Affairs to instruct the General Federation of Trade Unions to follow. The four conditions are: (1) Whether the individual's qualifications meet the provisions of Items 1 and 2 of the first article of the scope of application for deferred conscription for specialized technical workers in the national defense industry. (2) Whether the work currently engaged in is within the departments listed in Items 3 to 11 of the same scope, or approved by the Ministry for handling in accordance with the above provisions. (3) Whether the factory or workplace served meets the provisions of Items 12 to 14 of the same scope, has been registered and approved by the authorities, and the number of power facility employees meets the legal requirements. (4) Whether its competent authority, in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the application and review methods, has issued a certificate of technical duty or a technician qualification certificate in addition to issuing a list of names to the local regimental district headquarters for certification.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] According to a qualified person, this year's conscription in the city may be carried out by lottery in accordance with the law. This can be predicted from the fact that the central government's quota for the city this year is 6,000 people, which is double the number of last year. The person did not explain the reasons for this prediction, only said that citizens have the obligation to serve in the military, and the central government is now actively promoting military service in various places, and the results are satisfactory. Although Shanghai is an industrial and commercial area, with a population of four million, a quota of 6,000 is not a large number, and it can be easily carried out in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>[Another report] The military service meeting scheduled to be held in the city on the 29th will be held by relevant parties who will telegraph to the Director of the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Xu Siping, to come to Shanghai for guidance.</p>

<p>This time, the Military Service Association held Spring Festival condolences for the families of soldiers enlisted in the city, sending condolence money of 500,000 yuan to each family. Chairman Pan and others personally wrote a couplet, which greatly inspired all the families. However, a portion of the families could not be sent due to relocation of address. There are eight families in the original Jiangwan District, the Gao Lin family, the Xinshi District, the Huang Wang family, the Xincheng District, the Zhang Huang family, the Beizhan District, Qian Yuegao, the Jing'an District, Ruan Shuying, Ma Cuizhi, the North Sichuan Road District, Lu Xunqing, and the Yimiao District, Li Peng. They are currently retained by the Military Service Association, and it is hoped that the families will go to collect them.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Motion on Measures for Supervising County and City Finances; City Council Sends Telegram to Legislative Yuan Urging Repeal; Lists Reasons Based on Executive Yuan's Reply <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The City Council previously received a letter from the City Government, forwarding the Executive Yuan's order regarding the "Measures for County and City Councils to Supervise County and City Finances Before the Completion of Local Autonomy." It believes that these measures conflict with (1) the current City Council Organization Regulations, (2) change the law by order, (3) reduce the powers of local public opinion organs, and (4) violate the spirit of the Constitution. It has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request that it withdraw its order and explicitly abolish it, and has telegraphed the provincial and municipal councils to respond unanimously. It has successively received telegrams from the Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Henan, Jiangxi, and Chahar provincial councils expressing their approval and unanimously advocating for its abolition. It has also received a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan in reply. However, the Executive Yuan's reply only makes an abstract response to the first point in the original telegram, and avoids responding to the second, third, and fourth points. The council still believes that it is not satisfactory and difficult to accept.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the spirit of the Constitution and promote the rule of law, the council has, based on the replies from the various departments, weighed the legal principles, listed the reasons, and submitted them to the General Assembly for a public decision, so that the Executive Yuan can be telegraphed again and the national provincial and municipal councils can be telegraphed to unanimously advocate, and at the same time, the Legislative Yuan can be telegraphed separately to pay attention to the legislative procedures, not allowing the administrative institutions to arbitrarily change the law by order, and to urge the central government to withdraw its order and explicitly abolish these measures. The key points of the reasons stated in the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Executive Yuan cited the "Outline of County-Level Organizations," but the outline was promulgated as far back as September 1939, and the current City Council Organization Regulations were promulgated in January 1945. According to the legal principle that later laws take precedence over earlier laws, it should undoubtedly follow the rights granted by the current organization regulations. (2) According to the provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 22 of the current organization regulations, such as if they can be implemented effectively, the division of powers between local administrative organs and public opinion organs is detailed and rigorous, and they can be properly used. The section in the reply stating "making appropriate provisions during the transitional period" is really unnecessary. (3) The reply at the end cited Article 5 of the "Program for Ending the Period of Political Tutelage." This article clearly stipulates that the existing public opinion organs shall exercise their original statutory powers, and shall cease to do so on the date of completion of the election or reorganization in accordance with the Constitution. The "statutory powers" set up therein refer to the powers granted by the current organization regulations, which have been formally legislated, and by no means refer to the supervisory measures of the Executive Yuan, which change the law by order. This is even more obvious.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Election Commission held a closing meeting in the City Government Conference Room at 4:00 PM yesterday. Commissioners Wu Guozhen, Chen Baotai, Wang Lanseng, and other commissioners, and senior officials of the Election Office attended. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wu Guozhen, and the following three resolutions were made: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Election Office will close on February 28 and will be formally revoked from March 1. (2) All employees transferred from the Election Office will return to their original offices. (3) Employees in the Election Office who have excellent performance will be continued to be employed by the various bureaus and offices.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Global Tea Supply Fails to Meet Demand; My Country's Export Volume Increased Last Year; Shou Jingwei Encourages Tea Merchants to Seize the Opportunity <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>My country's tea industry has always occupied an important position in export trade. However, after the war, due to price fluctuations and increasing costs, export prices were hampered by the vast difference between the official exchange rate and the black market, making exports extremely difficult. Nevertheless, the domestic tea industry, in this exceptionally difficult environment, is still striving to support the government's development of foreign sales and earn foreign exchange. In order to understand the situation of my country's tea exports in the 36th year, the Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed Shou Jingwei, chairman of the China Tea Industry Association, who explained the tea export trade of the past year, the world tea market situation, and the prospects for my country's tea industry this year as follows:</p>
<p>Export Trade in the Past Year: The export volume of tea in my country reached as much as 1 million metric tons during its peak period in 1915, at the beginning of the 20th century. It still reached 400,000 metric tons between 1934 and 1938, but in 1946, the export volume was only 69,000 metric tons. The degree of decline in just over 30 years is quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Export Volume: According to the "Monthly Statistics of China's Import and Export Trade" published by the Statistics Section of the General Customs Administration last year, the November issue shows that from January to November, 43,774 metric tons of black tea, 79,240 metric tons of green tea, 687 metric tons of brick tea, and 9,236 metric tons of other teas were exported, totaling 132,937 metric tons. Compared with the 52,627 metric tons exported during the same period in the 35th year, this is an increase of 60 percent, which seems to be a slight improvement.</p>
<p>(A) Export Ports: From January to November of the 35th year, the total export volume was 52,627 metric tons, with Shanghai exporting 37,370 metric tons, Fuzhou 10,037 metric tons, Guangzhou 1,178 metric tons, Taiwan exporting only 175 metric tons, and other ports 3,867 metric tons. In the 36th year, Shanghai's exports totaled 70,106 metric tons, Fuzhou 7,784 metric tons, Guangzhou 6,546 metric tons, and Taiwan's exports increased sharply to 40,863 metric tons. Other ports accounted for 7,638 metric tons. From the above figures, it can be seen that the export volume of inland tea in my country, excluding Taiwan, was 52,452 metric tons from January to November of the 35th year, and 92,074 metric tons in the same period of the 36th year, an increase of 40,000 metric tons. Most of this was old tea, as the exchange rate affected the price of new tea, creating a situation where domestic prices were higher than international market prices, making it difficult to export smoothly. Due to its good production foundation in the past, Taiwan tea has recovered its production more quickly, enjoys a long-standing international reputation, and its quality is standardized and meets market needs. Therefore, last year's export volume, including December, reached 10 million pounds, recovering 50 percent of its pre-war peak.</p>
<p>(B) Export Tea Types: Among the exported teas, black tea accounted for 43,774 metric tons, and green tea 79,240 metric tons. Among green teas, in addition to 12,666 metric tons of Taiwanese Pouchong green tea, 5,173 metric tons of Pearl tea, 1,166 metric tons of Xichun, 1,180 metric tons of Yuqian, and 3,846 metric tons of Mao tea, the remaining 55,209 metric tons consisted mostly of Tunlu eyebrow tea, accounting for 41 percent of the total export volume, which is more than Qihong and Pinglu. Therefore, Tunlu has great potential for development and expansion of exports in the future.</p>
<p>(C) Export Countries: Before the war, my country's annual tea sales to the Soviet Union were 150,000 metric tons of red, green, and brick teas and other teas. North Africa, Morocco, and Algeria annually sold 100,000 metric tons of green tea (mainly Pinglu), and other countries in Europe and America sold more than 100,000 metric tons of red and green teas. In last year's January-November export figures, Hong Kong ranked first with 37,776 metric tons, followed by the United States with 15,569 metric tons, and the United Kingdom third with 6,640 metric tons. Next were Iben and Egypt, each selling 5-6,000 metric tons, and finally Canada and France, each with 1,7-800 metric tons, while the Soviet Union had only 8 metric tons. Although Hong Kong ranked first in the above figures, most of the tea was re-exported to other countries. North Africa, Morocco, and Algeria are not listed in the customs statistics monthly report, presumably included in the "other countries" category. As for the Soviet Union, due to the government repaying debts in US dollars in the 35th year, no barter trade was adopted, and most of the tea was transshipped through India to the Soviet Union. In December of the 36th year, the Central Trust Bureau used tea purchased in the 35th year for barter trade with the Soviet Union, and 30,961 cases have already been traded, totaling more than 2 million pounds, equivalent to more than 9,700 metric tons, including 2,440 metric tons of black tea and 7,260 metric tons of green tea, which will be shipped to the Soviet Union in the coming days.</p>
<p>Overview of World Tea Production: After World War II, major tea-producing countries such as Japan, the Dutch East Indies, Taiwan, and China were affected by the war, with tea factories destroyed, tea gardens abandoned, or converted to grow food crops, resulting in a sharp decline in production, especially in the Dutch East Indies. According to local communications, although a small number of tea factories are currently engaged in restoration activities, production is very low due to a lack of machinery and personnel. Commercially, the Dutch government controls it, with only a few Dutch merchants doing small amounts of buying and selling under government supervision, and the quality of the tea is much lower than pre-war levels. According to the American magazine "Tea &amp; Coffee" No. 90, the Japanese tea industry was indeed severely hit during the war, with production decreasing by nearly 90 percent compared to pre-war levels. However, under the administration of the US military headquarters, the Japanese government established a foreign trade department to handle tea exports. In 1946, 7 million pounds were exported to the United States, and a five-year plan was implemented starting in 1947, adding 7,352 acres of tea gardens each year, with a production capacity of 57,870,400 pounds, which is 50 percent of the pre-war production of 114.407 million pounds, showing a rapid recovery in production.</p>
<p>It is estimated that after the implementation of Japan's five-year plan, tea production can be increased by at least two times. With government assistance and a good foundation, Taiwan's tea production in 1947 has significantly increased compared to 1946. If the government can provide tea merchants with convenience in terms of exports, both export volume and production will not be difficult to restore to pre-war levels.</p>
<p>In addition, India, Ceylon, and British East Africa not only did not decrease but increased due to the government's implementation of procurement policies during the war. For example, India increased from 4.24 million pounds in 1935-39 to 5.62 million pounds, Ceylon increased by about 50 million pounds, and East Africa increased by 7 million pounds. However, it is estimated that the total tea production in 1947-48 will be between 902-906 million pounds, still less than the pre-war 983 million pounds.</p>
<p>Improve Quality, Encourage Exports</p>
<p>Prospects for My Country's Tea: This year, we should earnestly seize the rare opportunity of global tea supply failing to meet demand. At the same time, the Commodity Inspection Bureau should pay special attention to the strict inspection of tea, and tea merchants should also pay special attention to improving the quality of tea. It is especially important to denounce the mixing of inferior tea with high-priced tea. In addition to further actively encouraging local production in Taiwan and coordinating domestic tea for foreign sales, and continuing to provide tea loans, constructive new measures should be taken for foreign exchange adjustments and import linkages. The directors and supervisors of the Tea Association recently held a meeting to discuss this year's tea loan methods, and it is proposed to follow last year's silkworm cocoon loan plan, stipulating that the average price of each metric ton of tea should be based on the standard of exchanging 2.5 to 3 metric tons of rice, and the loan advance should be set at 10 percent. The total loan amount is currently difficult to determine. If the China Farmers Bank can continue to be responsible for the release and guarantee responsibility, the promotion of the national tea industry can be further developed.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Dunhuang Cultural Relics on Display for the First Time in Xi'an <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an by this Newspaper on the 17th] The name "Dunhuang" is not unfamiliar to us. We have long admired the Buddhist scriptures and statues in the Mogao Grottoes, forty miles away, but it is a pity that it is not easy to see the original works. It is of course not easy to travel far to the Hexi Corridor and cross the desert to make an on-site inspection, and there are not many opportunities to appreciate even reproductions, copies, prints, and photographs. In the past, we have seen some Dunhuang artworks introduced and disseminated by Stein, Pelliot, Zhang Daqian, Zheng Zhenduo, and others. This New Year, the Northwest Cultural Relics Research Office of the National Northwest University in Xi'an held the "Dunhuang Cultural Relics Exhibition" for the first time. The exhibition lasted for twelve days. Despite the overcast skies, snow, deep mud, and bad roads, the number of visitors every day was still so large. Most of the general visitors were able to accept the exhibits, and the effect was far better than that of ordinary personal art exhibitions.</p>
<p>Excavating Caves and Sculpting Buddhas for 1,500 Years</p>
<p>The types of exhibits in this exhibition are quite comprehensive. Although the number of exhibits is not large, they are exquisite, and after reading them, one can have a complete concept. The map of the Hexi Corridor, the panoramic photo of the Mogao Grottoes, and the long scroll of the panoramic view of the Thousand Buddha Temple sketched by Wang Ziyun (the host of the exhibition) at the entrance show the outline and scale of the Mogao Grottoes, giving the audience a bird's-eye view impression first. This Buddhist cave, which was opened 1,500 years ago and preserved to this day, has a history of more than a hundred years older than the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, or the Maijishan Grottoes.</p>
<p>The Buddhist scriptures of Dunhuang were originally extremely rich, but after foreign archaeologists took the lead in searching, looting, and stealing them, the important ones have almost disappeared. However, in this exhibition, we can still fortunately see the handwritten and engraved scriptures from around the Tang Dynasty, which are precious even though they are just fragments.</p>
<p>As for the text part, there are also rubbings of engravings, which, in addition to their artistic value, also help us understand the historical facts of the cave.</p>
<p>Sculptures and Statues of Superb Craftsmanship</p>
<p>We really cannot use words to describe the exquisiteness of the Dunhuang stone carvings and statues. Whether it is the overall shape or the details of the face, muscles, and folds of clothing, we use the eyes and standards of modern people to measure and evaluate them, and they are no less than or even surpass the ancient carvings and statues of Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>There are also four small clay Buddhist statues in the exhibition hall, each statue is less than ten centimeters high, and the faces of the Buddhas are no more than half a centimeter at the smallest, but the facial features are lifelike and exquisite, worthy of the title "divine craftsmanship!"</p>
<p>The Largest Murals Are Several Zhang High</p>
<p>There are two types of murals: original photos and reproductions. From the former, we can see the overall arrangement and composition, and from the latter, we can see the approximate original colors. Both are indispensable for appreciation. The largest "Sutra Transformation Picture" is seven meters high in its original size, with hundreds of figures in the picture. The themes of the murals can be roughly divided into several types: one is Buddhist statues and offering statues, both with colorful coloring and monochrome line drawing; one is the story painting of Buddhist scriptures, and there are also quite a few pattern paintings.</p>
<p>Two Styles, Each with Its Own Merits</p>
<p>Whether it is murals or stone carvings, their styles are clearly divided into two types: centered on the Northern Wei and Tang Dynasties respectively. The former includes the Eastern and Western Wei, Northern Zhou, and Northern Qi dynasties, and the latter includes the Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, and even later Song and Yuan dynasties. According to the explanation of expert Wang Ziyun: "The forms, techniques, and contents of the Wei and Tang dynasties are completely different. The former mostly depicts Buddhist stories, Nirvana pictures, etc. The techniques are only rendering, not emphasizing outlines, the brushstrokes are bold, and the atmosphere is grand. The bold style of the Xianbei people is revealed without reservation, and the sculptures retain the "Gandhara" style, with the influence of Greece and Persia being extremely strong.</p>
<p>"Tang Dynasty works transformed foreign Buddhist art into the inherent form of the East, forming a product of Chinese national temperament. Murals changed from rendering to outlining, colors changed from simple to gorgeous, content changed from simple to complex, and the themes of Buddhas and guests became richer..."</p>
<p>Ceiling Coffers Comparable to Flower Bricks</p>
<p>The pure patterns are mainly flower bricks and ceiling coffer patterns. Flower bricks were used in Tang Dynasty architecture and Buddhist caves. There are more than 20 kinds of patterns in the Mogao Grottoes. Each brick is 30-35 cm square, and the patterns are mostly radial, with the patterns protruding from the brick surface. The ceiling coffer patterns are painted on the ceilings inside the Buddhist caves, with colorful and rich colors, and are the best materials for researchers of patterns. From the style, it seems to be influenced by Persia and Arabia.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some pattern paintings with modern styles.</p>
<p>Namo Avalokitesvara Has a Beard</p>
<p>In addition to its supreme artistic value, Dunhuang cultural relics are also equally important for religion, language, customs, archaeology, costume history, and music history. An image of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva is exhibited in the exhibition hall. It is a man with an "eight"-shaped mustache and a "了"-shaped beautiful beard under his chin! The audience was amazed, but according to the records in the Buddhist scriptures, it is indeed so.</p>
<p>Tanabe Hisao, an authority on Eastern music history, often cites evidence from Dunhuang's musical instrument history. In the products of this exhibition, we saw various musical instruments and their performance and ensemble situations. One corner of the aforementioned "Sutra Transformation Picture" depicts more than thirty performers holding various musical instruments for ensemble. Whether they are blowing, plucking, beating, pulling, or dancing and plucking, they are all available. From this, we can imagine the musical style of the Tang Dynasty. In addition, many of the hairstyles and clothing of women in the murals coincide with modern ones, which is truly incredible. Who would have thought that the glass handbag of "Mademoiselle Modern" and the "Taoist hair bun" of 1948 had already been painted on the walls of Dunhuang a thousand years ago?

<h3 id="e77">Allied Headquarters and the Government Jointly Seek the Ancient Bell of Hanshan Temple Today <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 21st] The ancient Tang Dynasty bell of Hanshan Temple in Suzhou, which became famous in later generations due to the Tang poem "Gusu City, Hanshan Temple, the midnight bell rings to the passenger ship," was stolen and transported to Japan during the late Qing Dynasty. Currently, the two bells hanging in the Great Hero Hall and the "Dajue" Bell Tower of the temple are one from Japan as compensation and one newly cast in the 30th year of Guangxu, neither of which are the original.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Pei Yuan, the abbot of Hanshan Temple, submitted a request to the government based on years of documentary evidence to negotiate with Japan to recover the original bell so that this historical relic could be preserved. The case has been ordered by the Allied Headquarters to the Japanese government to investigate its whereabouts and return it to our country. The monks of the temple are collecting relevant photos and records of the bell's shape and weight for reference. Gui Yu, a defendant in the International Military Tribunal, and Yan Ru, a monk studying in Japan, are also assisting in collecting evidence, and it should not be difficult to return the treasure and allow the people of Gusu to hear the sound of the ancient bell of Hanshan Temple again.</p>
<p>The reporter specially visited the temple today and was received by Jue Xin, a guest monk, who said: This temple was originally "Dayin Temple," with the name "Hanshan." It was founded by Pu Ming (an ancient monk). It is rumored that the ancient bell was stolen by Japanese person Ōkuma Shigenobu in collusion with thieves in the early years of the Republic of China and transported to Japan. In fact, it had already been stolen and transported to Japan during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. This is evidenced by the bell inscription written by Ito Hirobumi, a Japanese person, which states: "The Tang bell was transferred to our country, but now its whereabouts are unknown. Yamada Hanshan searched very hard, but could not find it. Therefore, a new bell was cast and sold to be hung. April of the 38th year of Meiji (i.e., the 31st year of Guangxu, 1905 in the Western calendar)," which shows that the original bell was stolen no later than 1905. The bronze bell currently compensated by the Japanese is hung in the Great Hero Hall of Hanshan Temple. As for the bell hanging in the "Dajue" Bell Tower, it is made of iron and was cast by Chen Xiaoshi, the governor of Jiangsu, in the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906). All officials below the governor are inscribed on it, as detailed in Mr. Yu Quyuan's records. The shape and weight of the original bell are clearly recorded in the "Zhi Zhong." The text states: "The bell is smelted with extremely fine and exquisite craftsmanship, and it is uniquely ancient. The strokes are lively and dynamic, and when touched, it has edges. The sound of the bell seems to say: 'Annoyance is coming,'" presumably the new bell compensated by Japan was cast in imitation. Furthermore, the Allied Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to investigate the whereabouts of the ancient bell of Hanshan Temple based on negotiations by our government. The original text of the report submitted by Pei Yuan, the abbot of Hanshan Temple, to the Wuxian County Government in November of the 36th year is as follows:</p>
<p>"This temple originally had an ancient bell from the Tang Dynasty, which was secretly stolen and transported to Japan by Japanese person Ōkuma Shigenobu in the early years. Subsequently, negotiations were conducted, and Ōkuma Shigenobu cast a bell as compensation. His intention was to conceal the ancient bell. At the time, we were forced to accept it, and Ito Hirobumi came forward to help. The new bell was cast and engraved with the admission of theft. At the time, the monks of the temple were deeply concerned about involving international relations and affecting national relations, so they had to vaguely settle the matter. However, many Japanese officials and people excused themselves by saying that the bell was lost and could not be found. Until Mr. Kang Youwei visited the temple and wrote a poem, proving that the original bell was still in Japan. Furthermore, due to the arrogance of the island barbarians, we tolerated it without speaking out, but the desire to return the treasure has never left our hearts for a day. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was agreed to request the government to negotiate and recover the materials looted by Japan in our country. Therefore, the ancient bell of the temple should not be an exception. We have specially photographed the new bell and copied the inscription on the bell and the rubbings of Mr. Kang Youwei's poem carved in stone, and submitted them together. We reported to the Buddhist Association at all levels and forwarded them to the higher authorities, first negotiating with Japan. It is appropriate to submit a separate report to your government for review and assistance, requesting your government to intensify negotiations in order to achieve the goal of recovering the original bell. Not only will the temple gain a lot of glory, but your government will also create immeasurable merit. We humbly express our opinion, and look forward to your decision. The monks of the temple are extremely sincere and hopeful."</p>

<p>— Li Hanhun</p>
<p>Rugged Road</p>
<p>The policies currently implemented by the Labor Party in Britain are the legacy and modification of this program. The traditional spirit of Britain is to cure itself after problems arise. All nations with self-respect should be like this.</p>
<p>The path currently followed by Britain is a rugged road, as it inherits the fruits of the old civilization on the one hand and cultivates the tender shoots of the new civilization on the other. The traditions of history and geography make Britain stand firm in the middle, moving forward on a rugged road.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, other countries were still stagnating in small-scale agricultural production or the agricultural civilization had already broken down and was in the stage of demanding change. Industrial civilization certainly took British civilization a step forward, and at the same time changed the world civilization. This process and results are well known to the people of Britain and the world. But the people of Britain and the world also understand that industrialization has its inevitable drawbacks, and the best way to cure these drawbacks, in the view of the British nation, which has superior geographical and historical conditions and emphasizes practicality, lies in improvement rather than sudden change; in gradual progress rather than leaps. In other words, the bloodless revolution has already reaped great and obvious fruits in the 800 years of British history. Why can't this method be continued to solve all current problems? This is the aspiration of the British and the belief of the British.</p>
<p>The greatest ills produced by industrial civilization are monopoly, inequality, and unemployment. These ills are now being reformed by the British Labor Party. Starting from meeting the basic needs of each individual, a distribution system is stipulated. For example, food is rationed, with one or less than one egg per week, and bread is absent from every meal with a venue, so that the rich cannot indulge in wasteful spending, and ordinary people can also fill their stomachs and alleviate hunger.</p>
<p>This shows that the current British policy is an economic equalization policy. Large enterprises are nationalized, which can eliminate the ills of capitalist monopoly. Various social insurance laws are implemented to provide security and protection for the people of the country, and to reduce and even eliminate unemployment in the country. Increasing production efficiency without extending working hours, and restricting wages, all of these are to negate the old civilization and enlighten the way to the new civilization. From the theory of the past philosophers "seeking the greatest happiness of the greatest number" to the current policy of food rationing and nationalization of large enterprises, the British society is gradually moving into a new stage without bloodshed. Although the road is inevitably rugged, its future is very bright, and people with insight can predict it.</p>
<p>The economic policies currently promoted by the British Labor Party are very similar to the economic policies of Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood in the Chinese Kuomintang. There are many common similarities between China and Britain in terms of history and culture, so the basic theories and programs applicable to the lives of the people are also similar. The problem is that they can thoroughly implement it, while we have not fully realized it. Sun Yat-sen once pointed out that the Three Principles of the People is socialism, the only difference being the method. If there is a path to social revolution that does not require bloodshed, people of lofty ideals and benevolence will be happy to do their best to achieve it. China and Britain have a common goal and bear important responsibility for world balance. If they can move forward side by side, they will surely become the cornerstone of world stability, which can be asserted.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Cockfighting Flourishes in Jinhua; Outsmarting the Opponent, Living in Comfort; County Government Attempts to Suppress the Trend Weakening <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinhua, This Newspaper, 19th] Visitors to Jinhua cannot forget the delicious ham, the scenic beauty of North Mountain, and are eager to see the "cockfighting" entertainment.</p>
<p>Cockfighting is not unique to Jinhua; it also exists in the neighboring counties of Yiwu, Pujiang, Lanxi, and Wuyi. However, it is more commonly seen in Jinhua. Within Jinhua, the northeastern villages are more active than the southwestern ones. In northeastern villages such as Caozhai, Cenxia, Shankoufeng, Xietang, Zhongziyan, and Houlong, cockfights are held almost every ten days, with very few breaks. The origins of this custom are impossible to trace, but it has been around for a long time and has become a tradition. Because it is a folk custom in the old Jinhua area, no one can interfere. In the past, state officials, prefects, and county magistrates would often comply with public sentiment and not dare to prohibit it. Over time, it became a common practice and remains popular to this day.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance against Japan, the cockfighting trend decreased slightly due to the shortage of rural labor and the collapse of the rural economy. By 1942, Jinlan fell to the enemy one after another, and farmers fled in all directions. Cockfighting once disappeared. After the War of Resistance, farmers in the Jinlan area were happy to have survived the disaster, and their lives became more extravagant, so cockfighting became popular again in the countryside.</p>
<p>Perhaps some readers are eager to know what cockfighting is all about? Many readers have seen the terrifying scenes of Spanish bullfighting in movies, but cockfighting in Jinhua is a different style. Cockfighting in Jinhua is a battle between bulls. A wide, flat paddy field surrounded by low mountains is chosen as the cockfighting ground. These cockfighting grounds mostly belong to temple properties or land donated by landlords and are often used for cockfighting all year round, mostly left barren and uncultivated. Before the cockfight begins, the paddy field is plowed and flooded with a suitable amount of water. At each corner of the field, two green bamboos are used to form a decorative gate, hung with lanterns and ribbons. Amidst the sound of ceremonial cannons, the pair of bulls to be fought are led by the bull's "relatives" (the owners of the pair of bulls to be fought become close friends because of the cockfight) from the two gates on opposite corners, slowly approaching the center of the field in a grand manner, each corner of the cockfighting ground slowly approaching, behaving as if they were invincible. When the two bulls get close, the owners release the ropes of their bulls, and the two bulls begin to fight desperately, refusing to give in to each other. There are also tactics such as "hooking," "ramming," and "pulling." Each bull has its own strategy and tactics to insult the other, all wanting to outsmart the opponent and defeat them. The people watching the cockfight are watching these strategies and tactics. While the two bulls are fighting, dozens of bull separators stand by. These bull separators are all young and strong farmers, mostly with courage and skillful techniques. This occupation is hereditary. If the ancestors of the past separated bulls, the descendants of the next generation must not refuse; except for the days of the cockfight, the temples provide them with wine and meat to eat, and there is no other compensation. But the work is quite dangerous. Whenever the two bulls are fighting to the point where victory or defeat is revealed, they must rush forward and separate the two bulls to prevent them from continuing to fight. Therefore, bull separators are often knocked over into the field by the wild bulls when separating the bulls, and some are even seriously injured and killed by the horns.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is not enough time to separate the two bulls until the initial victory or defeat is revealed. Then the defeated bull flees in embarrassment from the cockfighting ground, and the victorious bull chases after the fleeing bull, refusing to give up. The bull separators also follow closely behind the bull to find a way to drag it back. After the victory or defeat is clear, the owner of the defeated bull secretly drags his bull away and buys it as a working bull or slaughters it for sale. The owner of the victorious bull washes the bull clean, adds a phoenix crown and red ribbons to the bull's body, and triumphantly returns in a grand manner amidst the sound of drums and gongs.</p>
<p>In ordinary cockfighting grounds, the bulls participating in the fights usually number more than fifty or sixty pairs, and some even have more than one or two hundred pairs. These fighting bulls are mostly driven in from neighboring villages, but in large-scale cockfights, they are driven in from neighboring counties hundreds of miles away. In order to give the fighting bulls that come to the competition a chance to use their skills, there are often three or four pairs of bulls fighting in the same paddy field at the same time. At this time, the low mountains around the paddy field become viewing platforms, with thousands upon thousands of men and women sitting and standing.</p>
<p>These bulls participating in the fights do not have to work in the fields like other working cattle. "Cockfighting" is their only task. They usually live in comfort, and their enjoyment often exceeds the lives of ordinary people. The owner feeds them white glutinous rice, wine lees, soybeans, etc. every day. On the eve of the competition, they are fed ginseng soup and the best old wine to excite their nerves. In winter, the cattle pens are extra warm. In summer, there are hired herders to fan them, and mosquito nets are hung up to prevent them from being disturbed by mosquitoes and getting sick. In short, wealthy farmers generally treat a hundred-battled, hundred-victorious bull with the courtesy of a distinguished guest. Ordinary fighting bulls are mostly raised by wealthy farmers. In areas where cockfighting is popular, wealthy farmers who do not raise fighting bulls are often subject to sanctions from local public opinion.</p>
<p>Generally, cockfighting begins in the summer. Except during excessively bad weather or busy farming periods, they are mostly fought every ten days until the following summer, when they stop. Therefore, it repeats itself, almost non-stop all year round; it is carried out as usual year after year, with very few breaks. The main reasons why this custom can be carried out without interruption are: (1) The countryside lacks proper entertainment, and cockfighting is used as a form of entertainment. (2) The countryside lacks education, and they superstitiously believe that "cockfighting" can eliminate animal plagues, and want to use it to drive away epidemics and protect their only important means of labor. (3) Farmers believe in Buddhism and use this to thank the gods. The county government believes that this custom wastes time and money and wastes labor, and has repeatedly issued orders prohibiting cockfighting, and has implemented three methods of suppression: (1) The fields used as cockfighting grounds that are not used for farming will be allocated to school funds; (2) The bulls participating in the fights will be forced to be slaughtered; (3) Those who take the lead in advocating "cockfighting" will be arrested and punished. However, although the methods are good, they cannot defeat the inherent customs of the local area. The cockfighting trend is popular in Jinhua and the villages and towns of the counties adjacent to Jinhua, and the government that declared war on "cockfighting" has softened and adopted a "let it be" attitude.

<p>[This Newspaper] The Student Union of St. John's University yesterday afternoon invited reporters to the Fanhuangdu Tea Room to report on the current situation of the school. It was stated that the spring semester of the school has not yet been scheduled and the tuition has not been determined.

<h3 id="e98">Catholic Education Conference; Successfully Concluded Yesterday; Tian Gengxin Emphasizes the Importance of the Position of School Education <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The National Catholic Education Conference was held at Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Shanghai from the 15th of this month for a continuous week and successfully concluded at 4:30 pm on the 21st. The Catholic Church's educational activities in China will be further promoted due to the convening of this conference. Cardinal Tian Gengxin, when giving a closing speech to the conference, strongly stated that school education must occupy a primary position in religious service plans. Archbishop Yu Bin, chairman of the conference, summarized the recommendations of this conference and specifically proposed the establishment of more technical schools, the establishment of a teacher introduction agency, and the reduction of teachers' financial difficulties. Other recommendations made at the conference included the establishment of a Catholic university in Central China, the organization of a National Catholic Alumni Association, and a request to the government to allow the establishment of normal schools. Some representatives also advocated promoting the importance of family education to assist schools in training children. Vice Archbishop Gao Siqian, Secretary-General of the Conference, spoke about the need for unity and cooperation among Catholic schools nationwide at the meeting on the morning of the 21st. Vice Archbishop Gao first explained the importance of unity to generate strength, and pointed out that the twentieth century is the century of collectivism, so unity is also to adapt to the trend of the times. In terms of the benefits of unity and cooperation, it can internally allow mutual observation and learning, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and externally facilitate requests to the government to improve inappropriate laws and regulations. Group organizations can also represent Catholic schools and participate in domestic and foreign educational and cultural group activities. Vice Archbishop Gao finally suggested that each diocese implement the educational programs voted on at this conference as much as possible within its possible scope, and hoped that Catholic schools across the country would fully cooperate with the School Education Group of the National Diocesan Association. Yuan Chengbin then discussed the plan for each diocese to hire consultants to regularly inspect Catholic schools together with the School Education Group of the National Diocesan Association. Ma Xiushi, principal of Shanghai Sino-French Middle School, advocated publishing Catholic education magazines in China.</p>
<p>Vatican Ambassador to China Li Peili congratulated the representatives on the successful completion of this education conference and especially praised Vice Archbishop Gao, who organized this conference, and Archbishop Yu Bin, Chairman of the Conference. In the evening, female students of Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences performed religious entertainment at the college's auditorium to entertain all the attending representatives.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from the US Information Service in This City] The US Information Service Library is preparing to hold a storytelling event for children during the first Saturday of March this year.

<h3 id="e100">Normal School Students Exempted From Tuition, Renovation, and Miscellaneous Fees; Municipal Education Bureau Submits Request for Approval to the Mayor <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The fee amounts for municipal secondary schools this semester have been stipulated by the Municipal Government. It is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau believes that the families of normal school students are mostly poor, and their service after graduation is particularly arduous. According to ministerial regulations, not only should they not be charged any fees, but they should also be given various subsidies as encouragement. The situation of students in midwifery and nursing schools is similar. This city has always been financially strained, and normal school students are only provided with room and board, without subsidies for uniforms, pocket money, and books. As for nursing and midwifery students, they even have to pay for their own meals, which is already a heavier burden compared to national schools. If they are further required to pay various fees, it would seem contrary to the government's intention of preferential treatment. After careful consideration by the Municipal Education Bureau and Director Li, a special request was submitted to Mayor Wu, proposing that starting from this semester, all fees collected by secondary schools should be waived for students in normal schools and midwifery/nursing schools. Apart from the teacher training fee, which will be supplemented from the original budget, the other two items, renovation and miscellaneous fees (480,000 yuan per student for renovation and 300,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees, totaling 780,000 yuan), calculated based on a total of 1,200 students, will result in a shortfall of 936 million yuan. The daily expenses of these schools depend on this fund, making it difficult to find a way to offset the loss. Therefore, a request is submitted to Mayor Wu for approval to add a budget to be paid by the municipal treasury in one lump sum for relief.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch] The Seventh National Games are scheduled to be held at the Jiangwan Stadium on May 5th. At that time, the attendees will be extremely crowded. The Transportation Committee of the Games held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at the Public Works Bureau, chaired by Zhao Zengjue, who is also the director of the committee, to discuss transportation issues. According to general estimates, there will be 100,000 attendees on the opening day, and an average of 60,000 attendees per day. The transportation arrangements must be planned in advance. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Citizens from Pudong and the southern part of the city will use ferries. The Municipal Ferry Company will operate special ferries from Dongmen Road to Qiu Jiang Wharf, and then use motor vehicles to transport them to the stadium. (2) Citizens from the western districts of Shanghai will use the railway. The Railway Bureau will operate temporary special trains. (3) Residents of the city proper are encouraged to use public transportation as much as possible, and private transportation companies are requested to assist in transportation. According to Director Zhao yesterday, although transportation can be resolved, the difficulty lies in the roads in the area, which have not been repaired, making it extremely difficult for motor vehicles to travel. The roads urgently needing repair include Huangxing Road, Qimei Road, and Yinxiang Road Bridge. The Public Works Bureau is requested to first estimate the budget and then submit it to the Municipal Affairs Conference for discussion and decision.</p>

After the initial contact, Hualian was taken advantage of by Qiantang due to unfamiliarity with the field. The home team took the lead, but the score was very close. Later, Hualian gradually became accustomed to the field and took a 34 to 20 lead in the first half. After switching sides, Hualian launched a fierce attack. Although Qiantang tried to fight back, they were ultimately outmatched in skill and suffered a complete defeat. Hualian was unstoppable. By the time the game ended, Hualian had won by a large margin of 81 to 38.</p>
<p>After the match, Kui Zhenzhong, the main player of the Hualian team, told a Guoguang News Agency reporter that, given the meager income from this exhibition match, all of Hualian's expenses in Hangzhou, including round-trip transportation, were borne by team leader Zhong Yuting, and no relief funds would be used to increase revenue.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch] Mr. Shen Zhennan, General Manager of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM from Taiwan. He told reporters that the purpose of his trip was to inspect the business situation of the Shanghai branch. The company held its third board of directors meeting in Taipei on February 12th of this year, and approved an improved sugar distribution method, changing to two methods: cash purchase or sugar distribution. As for the cash required for purchase, President Zhang of the National Bank stated during his visit to Taiwan that he would do his best to assist, so there should be no problem in raising funds. The exact production volume of Taiwan Sugar for this year will not be clear until March. However, due to the unexpected typhoon that hit Taiwan Island in November and December last year, sugar production will be affected. Therefore, it is estimated that the planned production volume of 300,000 tons will be reduced by about 10%. However, this number is still much higher than last year's production volume.</p>

<p>Since the base exchange rate was readjusted by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee a few days ago, the foreign trade tea market, which had been dormant for many days, showed a glimmer of hope yesterday. However, the number of transactions was still not large, and the selling price was pushed up strongly across the board. As for domestic sales tea, because many people from this street and foreign traders inquired, the market sentiment was still strong. Holders were holding firm to their asking prices, so the potential continued to show its advantages, and the market was standing strong and powerfully.</p>
<p>It was recently heard from colleagues that after the inventory of various products tended to shrink, although the buying trend in the market was still strong, it was like climbing a tree to catch a fish. Looking at this situation, the future is likely to be easy to rise and difficult to fall.</p>

<p>This year, various banks, money shops, and trust companies in this city have been absorbing idle funds and organizing group arbitrage, a trend that has emerged rapidly. Attracted by high interest rates, many citizens have invested in arbitrage through these banks, shops, and companies. Although these institutions' arbitrage activities are intended to encourage investment, the use of public funds to trade securities poses a risk. Should mismanagement occur, the public is bound to suffer. To prevent such malpractices and protect the property rights of the people, the financial authorities have dispatched personnel to conduct strict inspections of these institutions' group arbitrage businesses.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a surge in prices due to exceptionally loose liquidity among traders and reports of continued high prices in other ports. Both carters and customers showed strong appetite, with sellers stopping sales and turning to buying, and the market saw wild jumps again. Although the Textile and Construction Company repeatedly listed prices high, the consistently strong sentiment drove new high prices one after another.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately hit the 80 million mark at the opening.

<p>[Our Reporter] To encourage overseas remittances, the Bank of China has recently implemented a method of delivering remittances directly to recipients in areas near Guangzhou where families of overseas Chinese are concentrated, and also assists their families in writing letters. Concerned individuals have stated that the decline in overseas remittances is mainly due to the large difference between official and black market exchange rates, and subsidies are not a thorough solution. Based on the current situation, it is estimated that overseas remittances can reach 100 million US dollars this year, but this may not be as expected. The overseas remittance figures for January were slightly higher due to the New Year.</p>
<p>[Another News] The preparatory work for the Bank of China's Tokyo branch is progressing actively. Manager Chiang Wu-i is waiting for his passport to be issued and will fly directly to Tokyo. However, business is difficult to develop before the peace treaty is established. Mr. Zhang recently stated: "The branch's business is aimed at private trade. It will do its best to assist with the deposit and remittance of private trade, and overseas remittances are also among the operations. The opening date will be decided after arrival." Only two accompanying personnel have been approved by MacArthur's headquarters.</p>
<p>Also, it was recently learned from the Overseas Remittance Group of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau that the total amount of overseas remittances received by the Bureau last month has increased slightly compared to the past, totaling 5.4 billion yuan.

<p>[Our Reporter] The China Commercial Arbitration Association held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the China Merchants Bureau Building, with more than 50 members and 30 guests attending. The meeting was chaired by Wang Xiaolai, the head of the association's preparatory committee. Mr. Wang gave an opening speech, stating that the history of commercial arbitration in China is the longest and most praised by countries in the world. The establishment of the China Commercial Arbitration Association was initiated in October of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) at the suggestion of the US government and was endorsed by the Chinese government and business community. Due to the extremely close trade relations between China and the United States, commercial disputes are inevitable. To meet the needs of modern commercial conditions, arbitration institutions in various countries are vying to establish themselves. However, China's commercial arbitration institutions have not yet had a complete organization. In order to unite the business community and other professional groups, adopt methods of reconciliation, mediation, and arbitration to resolve commercial disputes, sign agreements with the American Arbitration Association, and establish joint arbitration, the government decided to invite the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the National Industrial Association, together with national business and professional groups, to be responsible for preparatory work.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Shou Jingwei then reported on the preparation process. Guests delivered speeches separately. Finally, the articles of association were amended, and directors and supervisors were elected. The elected directors are Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, Wu Yun Chu, Chen Tingrui, Zhuang Zhihuan, Jiang Yiping, Shou Jingwei, Xu Xueyu, Li Ming, Luo Beichen, Dong Yunzhang, Shen Rixin, and 25 others. The supervisors are Xu Jiyi, Du Yuesheng, Qiu Liangrong, and 7 others. It was also decided to hold the first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors tomorrow to elect the chairman and executive directors. The association's address is temporarily located at China Tea Joint Venture Company, No. 5 Tumingyuan Road, this city.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Women and Fashion <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The love of beauty and novelty is human nature, especially for ladies. According to the saying, "Women adorn themselves for those who appreciate them," dressing up and being beautiful can be said to be their duty. To tell the truth, what gentleman doesn't like to see his wife dressed beautifully, and what father with a daughter doesn't want to see his daughter like a beautiful flower? This psychology is true human nature, and it is the normal state of mind.</p>
<p>As Frank Harris once said: If there were no women in the world, it would be like a garden with only trees, although lush, it would inevitably be too lonely and too monotonous. So, even a sacred being like Jehovah, after initially creating Adam, also took bone and flesh from him to create Eve, to accompany him.</p>
<p>However, although God can create women, it is likely that even as holy as He is, He did not understand women's psychology. He thought that women were only created for the needs of men, so initially He did not want them to know that this world might have the beauty of clothing, and only made them live naked in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>But Eve was, after all, a woman. Before she had a self-awareness of feminine beauty, she was finally tempted by that pair of bright red apples. Despite Jehovah's serious warning in advance, she still ate them. This one bite of hers was not a big deal, but it has benefited fashion store owners for generations and distressed gentlemen's pockets. Why? Because since she ate the apple, she had a sense of shame and demanded to wear clothes.</p>
<p>The problem of clothing may not matter to some people, but for women it is a second life. This is by no means an exaggeration. Not long ago, didn't women in Britain and the United States hold demonstrations over the length of skirts? I am not a moralist. I even think that a country whose women are willing to demonstrate for the trivial matter of clothing proves how vibrant the society of this country is. On the contrary, everyone in uniform blue long gowns, simplicity is certainly simple, but it also only proves the poverty of this country.</p>
<p>Know that the problem of beauty is not the same as the problem of extravagance. Look at some bejeweled ladies. Luxury is luxury, but other than being vulgar, there is no beauty to be found. The concept of beauty is cultivated from a person's spiritual refinement. If ladies are willing to pay attention to the beauty of their clothes, they can indeed add a lot of color to society. However, it must be noted that the beauty of education will not become vulgar. Otherwise, shortening and lengthening, merely seeking formal novelty, is waste rather than seeking beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Equality and Similarity <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhiying</p>
<p>Equality and similarity have absolutely different definitions in geometry, but many people confuse these two terms. For example, the repetition of history only includes the meaning of the similarity of two or several historical facts, but many people, even scholars and professors, think that the repetition of history is equality between the past and future.</p>
<p>A very large equilateral triangle and a very small equilateral triangle, although their three interior angles are all "equal" to sixty degrees, however, looking at these two entire equilateral triangles, they only belong to "similarity" in geometry; similarly, history is always a thing of the past, strictly speaking, history will never repeat itself, at most a few parts of the environment seem to be similar, or some factors are the same. The situation of Germany after the First World War and Japan after the Second World War is certainly very similar, and their encounters are very similar, but we cannot say that Germany is "equal" to Japan!</p>
<p>Someone said that history is like a sine curve, starting from zero function, going through positive, zero, negative one and returning to zero, and then progressing cyclically in this order. At first glance, this theory seems to be somewhat like the first sentence of Romance of the Three Kingdoms: "It is said that the general trend of the world, after a long period of division, must unite, and after a long period of union, must divide." If we analyze it carefully, we will know that the former represents periodic "equality", and the function value obtained every three hundred and sixty degrees is absolutely the same; but the latter is not. This old tune fully expresses the art and smoothness of Chinese people's speech. It only explains the meaning of "similarity". On the surface, it seems very affirmative, but in reality, it is equal to saying: "After many sunny days, it will definitely rain; after it rains, the sky will definitely turn sunny." Although the word "definitely" is said twice in a decisive tone, there is no time limit for "long" and "after", so I think this only represents some "equality" in the "similar" triangle.</p>
<p>To give another example, under certain circumstances, especially in a warm atmosphere, such as reading quietly under a lamp, burying one's head in meditation, resting under a tree, etc., people often feel a very familiar feeling. In fact, maybe you have indeed experienced this scene, because this environment can make you feel happy and relaxed, so it is easy to produce an impression, and you will associate the past scene with similar situations, but in fact, the environment has changed somewhat, and it cannot be exactly the same, unless time flows backwards.</p>
<p>Spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the four seasons cycle endlessly, but the seasons are different every year. How many times can the average temperature be equal, despite the warm and cold weather?</p>
<p>Therefore, Einstein said: There is nothing in the world that can be said to be "equal".</p>
<h3 id="e133">The White Cloud Temple of Beiping <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yansheng</p>
<p>During the New Year, most people like to go out and travel. In addition, famous places are open by agreement during the New Year, just like the Niangniang Temple in Tianjin and the City God Temple in Shanghai. There are many people who go to visit and worship in the Buddhist and Taoist fields. There are even more people who go to travel and enjoy themselves with friends. There are also many places open during the New Year in Beiping, mostly in the suburbs outside the city. Therefore, we have seen many people traveling to visit the famous places for the Spring Festival during the New Year.</p>
<p>Du Gongbu's poem "Beautiful Lady's Walk" says: "On the third day of the third month, the weather is new, and there are many beautiful ladies by the waterside in Chang'an." This can be said to be taking the opportunity to travel because the weather is warm. Now, these people are not afraid of the chilling spring, and the taste of winter has not yet faded, and they are going to visit, which can be said to be a not shallow.</p>
<p>The White Cloud Temple in the western suburbs of Beiping has the most days open during the New Year. Other places such as the Dongyue Temple, the Great Bell Temple, and Changdian are almost all open until the Lantern Festival. Only the White Cloud Temple closes on the 19th day of the first lunar month, and the day before there are laymen giving alms, and there is a "meeting of immortals" in the evening. Although it involves superstition, this custom has been passed down for a long time and shows no sign of declining. As everyone celebrates the Spring Festival, these embellishments add a lot of prosperity.</p>
<p>The White Cloud Temple is a large Taoist temple in the near suburbs of Beiping. It is the temporary residence of Qiu Chuji of the Yuan Dynasty, and it has a great influence in leading Taoism. Because the abbot of the White Cloud Temple participated in court affairs at the end of the Qing Dynasty, his influence increased sharply, and many wealthy merchants were willing to go there to give alms. When it was open during the lunar New Year, merchants were invited to set up stalls, and all the old Taoists in the temple were mobilized to handle the Spring Festival opening. In general, tourists always feel that they must go to the White Cloud Temple during the New Year. In the past, from the early years of the Republic of China (1911-1912) until the teens, there were car and horse races behind the White Cloud Temple. Teahouses were built on both sides, and there was a very wide track in the middle. Gentlemen, because they had cars and horses at home, went to this place to show off and compete with each other. Although there were no prizes, it was most glamorous to have a beautiful car and horse and be the first in the race. When they passed, people drinking tea in the teahouses shouted and cheered, very much like the cheerleaders in today's ball games. However, this has disappeared with the rise in the cost of living and the changes of the times. Not only is there no interest in it, but even the wealthy families of that year now feel that their strength is insufficient, so it has been abolished invisibly. The track still exists now, but the people who used to compete don't know where they are now!</p>
<p>The White Cloud Temple is not very far from the city of Beiping. In addition to various vehicles, there is also a common sight during the New Year, which is that everyone rides donkeys. Riding a small donkey in the face of the spring breeze on the flat sandy plains is also a picture of enjoyment in the Spring Festival of Beiping. Now, the cost of riding a donkey is quite enough to buy several long-eared male donkeys in those days. Li Yuwen introduced the famous violinist Joshua Heifetz to a boxing champion at a banquet. Out of politeness, Mr. Heifetz had to talk to him politely.</p>
<p>"We are in the same business," said Mr. Heifetz, "We all make a living with our hands, haha."</p>
<p>The boxer looked him up and down and said:</p>
<p>"Gosh, it's good for you that there are no marks on your face!"</p>
<h3 id="e134">On Forbearance <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Ti Zhai</p>
<p>Many people praise Du Mu's line of poetry: "Forbearance brings joy in the aftermath." But in reality, this is nothing more than a negative way of saying "A small act of impatience ruins great plans," and there is nothing particularly unusual about it. If one ponders it carefully, the ability to endure is a state that is not easily attained by those who strive for virtue. Perhaps what is meant by "joy in the aftermath" is not the thing endured, but one's own self-cultivation. Buddhists also speak of endurance, humility, diligence, and progress, which are different from what Ah Q did. Ah Q still had a fabricated sense of victory to comfort his empty feelings and emotions of failure, while this [Buddhism] requires genuine "no ignorance" and "also no end to no ignorance," "no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma." If one does not regard all phenomena as empty, then the "fire of ignorance" will inevitably arise. Jesus advised people that if someone strikes your left cheek, offer them the right one as well. This is not pure forbearance, but also has an element of sacrifice. What I mean by forbearance, in the narrow sense, is not changing one's expression. Personally, I am truly unable to achieve this virtue.</p>
<p>The opposite of forbearance is contention, which has been opposed by sages and worthies throughout history. Only Cui Dongbi, who liked to be skeptical of antiquity, advocated contention, and wrote a grand article called "Debate," which contained many brilliant arguments, but I cannot quote them all here. I just feel that forbearance is a tremendous burden, both physically and mentally. The source of this forbearance must contain the word "anger." According to Western scientists, hunger, fear, pain, and anger can cause drastic changes in the nerves. When an angry dog is X-rayed, its stomach immediately stops moving, and digestion can cease for more than two hours. Although humans are higher in position than dogs, the physiological response to anger should be no different, so I say that enduring humiliation, which means containing anger, is a physical burden. As for the mental burden, I need not say more, everyone can understand it. Here, I offer another opinion: that forbearance and cruelty may well originate from the same source. Forbearance is directed towards oneself, while cruelty is directed towards others, but their basic inclination is the same: "inhumanity." Zhang Xianzhong and Huang Chao killed people for pleasure, and Ma Shumou ate human flesh for pleasure, and are indeed the abominable ancestors of cruelty. But are the Japanese, who light white paper lanterns and commit ritual suicide in the dark, and then have their good friends cut off their heads (which the Japanese call "kaishaku"), not also cruel? We cannot say that being cruel to others is evil, but being cruel to oneself is good. Of course, we cannot compare all forbearance to ritual suicide, but enduring a burden that one does not want to bear is essentially the same as enduring being killed. So I suspect that someone who can endure what others cannot endure is probably a cruel fellow. There are countless examples in history. Goujian, the King of Yue, tasted the feces for the King of Wu, and endured hardship and planned revenge, but later he killed Wen Zhong and alienated the doctor Fan Li. The King of Han shared the soup of his father, but later he killed Han Xin and Peng Yue. Fan Zeng's words were truly meaningful: "The King is not forbearing." These two words, "not forbearing," vividly portray an honest and loyal Xiang Yu, and it was already destined that he would not achieve great success.</p>
<p>Mencius put it even better: "Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others," which is a sense of compassion, and is "the beginning of benevolence." This heart seems like it should be easy to develop, but from ancient times to the present, how many people have truly been able to practice forbearance everywhere? There has not even been a decade without war in all of Chinese history, so you can know what this so-called culture and civilization of mankind really is! War is just the most concrete aspect of forbearance. Society as a whole has always consisted of two classes: the exploiters and the exploited. If you are not an exploiter, you will inevitably become an exploited one, and their survival is based on the word "endure." The exploited must endure hardship in exchange for food and warmth, and the exploiters must close their eyes to the many pitiful creatures in order to fill their own pockets. Because of this, I often feel that Aesop's Fables are very unreasonable. Why use foxes, lions, dogs, and donkeys to describe people? Frankly speaking, the animal society is actually much more "humanized" than human society. At least the two relationships mentioned above do not exist. Prostitution, venereal disease, lawsuits, and hypocrites... do not exist. Although the Englishman Hobbes said that "man meets man as a wolf," wolves are ultimately much easier to deal with than people. Ultimately, this is because beasts do not have the virtues and concepts of "forbearance." If you don't believe me, look again: what happened to Gandhi, who showed love throughout his life and always advocated non-resistance?</p>

<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>·Haverford·Taft· An American federal judge from Ohio. One morning, he went to a barbershop for a shave.</p>
<p>"Are you Judge Taft, sir?" the barber asked as he prepared to shave Taft.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," Taft replied, settling his massive frame comfortably.</p>
<p>"Do you remember a man named Stabbins? You sentenced him to twenty years in prison." The barber was carefully honing a razor. He was a tall black man. Taft noticed an ugly scar on his face that ran from his cheekbone to his chin.</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember Stabbins," Taft replied, "a bad egg."</p>
<p>"He was my brother," the barber said. He placed the razor against the judge's throat. For the next few minutes, the only sound in the small barbershop was the scraping of the razor. As the sharp blade moved up and down between Taft's jaw and throat, he felt himself begin to sweat. He closed his eyes, contemplating the end of his life and what awaited him.</p>
<p>Finally, the barber stepped back and snapped the razor shut. "Alright, Judge," he said. "You did the right thing. My brother was not a good man. He deserved to go to jail."</p>

<p>— Ru Yi</p>
<p>Prince Condé of France wanted to test his son's financial management skills, so before leaving Paris, he gave the boy fifty gold Louis (a type of French gold coin in the past—translator's note) to spend as he pleased.</p>
<p>When the Prince returned home, the boy happily ran up to him and said, "Father, the money is here, I haven't spent a single coin."</p>
<p>Without a word, the Prince led his son to the window and silently threw all fifty gold Louis onto the street outside.</p>
<p>Then he said, "Son, if you had 'virtue,' you would have already given this money to others; if you had 'ability,' you would have spent this money very appropriately. If you have neither virtue nor ability, then in the future you should often do as I have just done—at least give the poor a chance to receive some of your money."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Tao Qian Begging for Food <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xinhua</p>
<p>Tao Qian refused to bow down for five pecks of rice, resigned his post and returned to his farm. In his later years, he wrote a poem about begging for food: "I come and go, not knowing where I am going. I walk and walk until I reach this village, where I stand at the door, clumsy in my words." One can imagine his poverty. Wang Wei, a famous poet of the Tang Dynasty, wrote a letter to Layman Wei, in which he said: "Recently there was Tao Qian, who refused to bend his waist to see the inspector because of his post and resigned his official position. Later, he was poor and begged for food, and wrote in a poem: 'I stand at the door, clumsy in my words,' which means he was often ashamed from begging. If he had just seen the inspector, he could have eaten from the public fields for several acres. He could not bear one instance of shame, and ended up being ashamed for the rest of his life?"</p>
<p>If one stands from the position of a pragmatist, what Wang Wei said is the truth; rather than being poor and begging for food, it is better to endure being bullied and be a happy magistrate. However, "starving to death is a small matter, losing integrity is a big matter." Tao Qian's refusal to see the inspector was long seen by a group of people as a disguise for "not serving two surnames." Therefore, the moralists expressed strong disgust for Wang Wei's remarks.</p>
<p>It is said that Wang Wei could sing the "Yu Lun Pao" song and was deeply appreciated by a certain princess of the time, so he was able to become a Jinshi. Later, he surrendered to An Lushan and accepted a false appointment, so Zhang Erqi of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties severely criticized Wang Wei. He said: "Mo Jie's views are thus. Based on this, 'Yu Lun Pao' is not a false accusation. When he held Zheng Qian's hand and shed tears while chanting the lines about the Ningbi Pool, and when he heard the disposal order for the first time, and thought back to the old man of Chaisang, dragging his staff to visit relatives and friends, who should be ashamed and who should not be ashamed?" He scolded him quite viciously, which is not surprising, as Zhang Erqi was originally a figure of Gu Tinglin's school. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, they all lived in seclusion and wrote books, so they naturally ridiculed Wang Wei.</p>
<p>Du Fu has a poem dedicated to Censor Zhao Jian, saying: "Riding a donkey for thirty years, I lived in the capital in the spring. In the morning, I knock on the doors of the rich, and in the evening, I follow the dust of fat horses. Leftover wine and cold food, everywhere I secretly feel sad and bitter." His appearance of wagging his tail and begging for mercy is really disgusting. Gong Ding'an once wrote a poem ridiculing Du Fu, saying: "Tao Qian's nature is straightforward and gentle, and he is secretly rewarded for the kindness of a meal. I feel that Shao Ling's poetry is thin, only saying that he knocks on the doors of the rich in the morning." The same is begging for food, but one is abandoning his official position, and the other is pursuing fame and success. The two cannot be compared.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Socialization of Universities (Part 1) <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>A university is a higher academic institution. As the name suggests, it should have a strong academic atmosphere. I do not know the inner workings of today's universities; when I was studying at university, I also did not know the inner workings of other universities. Although I am not Mencius' mother, I have also changed universities three times. Based on my personal experience, I can briefly describe my impressions as follows.</p>
<p>Universities overly emphasize exams. Upon entering university, there is a university entrance exam. During the semester, there are a prescribed number of so-called "small tests," and teachers also give impromptu tests "as they feel like it." At the end of the semester, there is naturally the so-called "big exam." Students do not choose just one subject, and there is more than one teacher, so you test me, I test you, test today, test tomorrow, a small test every three days, a big test every five days, tested until one's head is dizzy and one's heart is filled with unspeakable sorrow. Cross-examination and firm-examination, what is the meaning of it? I still don't understand it. I remember the most ridiculous thing was that there was an American teacher who taught English and used Stevenson's "Treasure Island" as the textbook. Once, during an exam, he asked a rather bizarre question: How many robbers were mentioned in "Treasure Island," and how many were left by a certain chapter? Alas! What relationship does this kind of question have with one's English performance? Students spend precious time and money, and should be focusing on how to devote all their energy to learning the knowledge they want to acquire, but now they are wasting it on boring exams. Is this not a very regrettable thing?</p>
<p>Universities, like other institutions in our country, have become mere formalities. Teachers and students only know to respond to the bell to go to class, and to wait for the bell to dismiss class. Upon hearing the bell, students swarm into the classroom like a flock of sheep, and upon hearing the bell again, they file out of the classroom as if relieved of a heavy burden. Among the teachers, there are indeed occasional erudite scholars, but there are also not a few whose ambition is only to earn a living as educators. When these people teach, they either speak nonsense or stammer, in short, they say whatever comes to mind, rarely hitting the essence of the matter. Thus, the teachers mumble to themselves, and the students gossip among themselves. A few kind-hearted and intelligent people diligently write, transcribing the teacher's mumbles into notes. Even fewer talented people, regretting the waste of time, either write books or bury themselves in reading what they love to read.</p>
<p>The most incomprehensible thing about universities is the so-called "credit" system. You must complete a total of five credits in "History," six credits in "Chinese," four credits in "Banking," three credits in "Currency"... If you have no interest in "Banking" or know that you already have a good understanding of "Banking" and see no need to take another four credits, but want to replace it with another four credits in "Currency" and tell this to the registrar's office, the registrar's office will not only look at you strangely, but will certainly say sternly: "How can this be!" Because the school authorities have prepared "goods" that are only four credits for banking, and only three credits for currency, and there is no way to increase or decrease them, and students have no way to exchange them. This is like holding a horse's head down to drink water. If the horse is willing to let you do as you please, then this horse must not be a fine horse. But this is not surprising, as there are not many "Bo Les" (excellent horse trainers) on campus, so they simply treat all students as inferior horses. And students who have completed the prescribed number of subjects and credits and have passed the so-called "exams" are then considered "graduated" and are called "bachelors" or some other type of scholar; this is simply a mysterious and unfathomable thing.</p>
<p>Under this situation of poor teachers and excessive emphasis on formalities, the academic atmosphere has been completely lost—or perhaps it can be said that there has never been an academic atmosphere in the first place. Students entering such a university to study is like "climbing a tree to catch fish." The waste of manpower and money, and the loss of time and career are at their worst.</p>
<p>I have often thought about it: Why must students go through an "entrance exam" to enter university? For example, a businessman suddenly feels interested in "textual research," and Dr. Hu Shih is the most renowned expert in the study of "textual research" in China and abroad. This businessman urgently wants to hear Dr. Hu Shih's grand theories. Suppose this businessman is very busy and is not familiar with the subjects required for the entrance exam, such as English and algebra, or although he knew them before, he has now completely forgotten them, and he is only interested in the textual research class taught by Dr. Hu Shih. Under the restriction of the entrance exam, this businessman cannot easily achieve his purpose and has to give up his aspiration to study. University education is not compulsory education, but this businessman has enough money to pay tuition and he has a desire to study. What reason do we have to exclude him from the university? In order to study textual research, if this businessman gives up his business and re-studies English, algebra, and other subjects to take the exam, even if he is lucky enough to be admitted, would this price not be too high? This is one reason. Second: Why does the university stipulate a four-year system? If you regard the "school year" as the "hard labor" of a prisoner, or the "seclusion" of a monk, then how much is a person's life? Two years is too much. If you treat "education" as "education," then forty years is too little; what we want to learn is not something that can be learned in four years?</p>
