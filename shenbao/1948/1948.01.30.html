<h3>我提財經改革計劃　美國政府將予考慮　馬卿晤貝顧係商討全局</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕國務卿馬歇爾宣稱：美政府對於中國政府聲明中所提之十點改革計劃，將予以考慮。渠稱：援華之建議已由國際財政顧問委員會完全通渦，現已提交預算局，一經預算局審查完畢後，即將提交國會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美財長史奈特證實渠任主席之全國財政顧問委員會業已接獲援助中國計劃，並在硏究中，惟渠拒絕作更詳細之評述。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日電〕馬歇爾廿八日與我技術代表團團長貝祖詒舉行會議，對美國援華計畫　一般性之商討。我駐美大使顧維鈞亦會參加廿八日下午在國務院舉行之五十分鐘會議，會後向記者宣布上項消息。又據貝氏稱：代表團與國務院官員之聞，迄已舉行三次會議，均為純粹技術性質者。記者詢顧氏，除技術援助外，中國已否提出軍事援助之要求，顧氏答稱：中國歡迎任何種類之援助，中國並未向國務院提出任何確定之數字，但將提出其他關於中國善後及建設之計畫，貝祖治與馬卿會晤後，又與國務院遠東司長白德華有所商談。</p>
<p>〔央社華盛頓廿八日合衆電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞與美國務卿馬歇爾晤談後，吿報界稱：美援華計劃三億美元，當可使中國在建設方面獲一開端，但全盤建設工作，將需更長時間及更多金錢。顧氏今偕同中國技術代表團團長貝祖詰至國務院，與馬歇爾進行會談，事後聲稱：渠等留與馬卿　中國全盤局勞作一般性之商討，技術代表團業已與美方官員舉行三次會談。顧氏末稱：中國　展　子江水　之計劃，因等待要求美國援助之結果，故迄在擱置中。　　〔本報訊〕在美請學之張君勱，近有信致民社黨黨員，謂在華府曾與爲歇爾。魏德邁晤談，經濟援華爲談話主題，美援之全數將在三億美元以上。　　　　〔聯合社　約廿八日電〕世界電報廿八日社論稱：中國東九省之危局，中·美兩國政府應同負其責，但交責之時期現已過去，此際待看杜魯門總統與蔣主席之行動·華盛頓與南京應迅速團結，遺忘相互之責難，趕運必耍之美國供應品並派遣顧問，以代替不能產生同　援所效果之任何中國文官與武將。</p>
<h3>巴大維在京發表談慶　稱讚我民族偉大　今日起巡視顧問團內部</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕新任美陸軍顧問團團長巴大維中將，廿九日晨八時許在渠之辦公室中舉行記者招待會首中對外聯絡官凱特介紹記者一一與巴氏相識寒喧後，八時半巴氏發表談話，渠首讚中國民旅之偉火，尤以用人工完成艱鉅之史迪威公路工程一事，使其永感欽仰，渠極樂於了解中國且樂與中國人士爲友，此次奉命來華担任職務，希望能爲蔣主席之助手，爲中美軍事合作服務，對顧問團之組織暫不擬大更動，俟事實需要慢慢改變。渠在　府曾晤魯克斯將軍，相談獲得助益不少，魯氏現已赴巴拿馬，　任臨時職務。巴氏廿九日晨起曾至勵志社所辦餐廳參觀其僚屬進　餐情形，招待記者後，將與　屬分別晤談，午後二時許訪我國防部代理參總謀長林蔚，六時　席司徒大使酒會，被介紹與我以軍首長多人相識。渠定卅日全　與僚屬接觸，並巡視顧問團內部，晚間將赴軍官俱樂部與僚屬　　等親眷見而。卅一日晨與顧問團官兵談話後，續巡視顧問團內部，午後訪　山參觀砲兵訓練中心，下月一日（星期）休息，二日拜訪中國國防部，晚赴司徒大使宴，三日飛滬視察，其後並將赴漢口，北平等地檢閱顧問團在各該地區之工作。巴氏此行係單身來華，渠擬令其現在美就讀大學之兩女公子來華度木年暑假。　　　〔中央社南京廿九日電〕美大使司徒雷登廿九日晚六時半在曾邸特爲巴大維中將舉行鷄尾酒會，招待我政府軍政首長及駐華外交使團，到有張羣，王世杰，葉公超，甘乃光，林蔚，秦德純，郭懺，周至柔，桂永淸及駐華外交使團武官多人。</p>
<p>改進稅收工作　稅署三項決定　　　　〔本　南京廿九日電〕直接稅署連日舉行業務檢討會議，對今後工作已獲得三項重要決定，改進所得稅之征收：　營利事業所得稅稽征辦法，改用佔征方式，利息所得稅之稽征，則參加金管局共同檢查銀錢行莊之往來帳簿，並與海關貨物稅局，金管局加强聯擊。　　產稅得以實物抵繳　　，加　　產登記限制本名之使用，配合戶籍訪查，使遺產稅稽征得順利推行。　特種營業稅款實行彙繳，同時力求控制稅源及稅收，此次會議，該局各地分局主管人員均出席，由王撫洲主持，廿九日爲最後一日，將討論稅務機構之調整人事之配合，以及會計等問題。下午即行閉幕。　　花紗布管制委會　將在全國設辦事處　　　〔本報南京廿九日電〕花紗布全面管制之六項實施細則，不久即將公佈。聞花紗布管委會爲欲貫澈管制花紗布之原來目的，將在全國設立辦事處十七個，並在各工廠派設駐廠員，督促辦理。</p>
<h3>國代當選名單　公布期尙有待</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國代當選人名單公布尙有待，因其中友然人士提名而落選者甚多，雖經國民黨在退讓友黨辦法下盡量退讓，但仍有因碍於社會賢達以及得票過少不足候補候選人資格者，計民社有五十餘人，靑年有卅餘人，國民黨已於廿八，九兩日分別將此項名單抄送兩黨，請設法解決，現正由兩黨各自研討中。</p>
<h3>九龍城及沙面兩事件　癓結點仍為主權　外部完成任何交涉準備</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕中·英交涉廿九日無發展，雙方對九龍城問題歧見之僵持，使我政府常局更重視談問題之基本原因，外部方面刻已完成必要準備，隨時可從事任何程序之交涉。英使館發言人坦白承認，當前談判之撤結在於三事：　九龍城之管轄權問題，　被捕居民釋放問題，　賠償問題，然據明白九龍城交涉詳情者稱，癓結雖有不同表現，基因仍爲主權問題，即以第二點論，中國之立塲原認港政府無權在九龍城逮捕居民，港法庭亦無權管轄此案，故王外長曾於本月中訓示鄭天錫大使，對英政府嚴重交涉，請求立即釋放被捕二居民，以爲談判之第一步，然英方對此絕不同意，照舊維持港府尊嚴，不予置理，由此以觀，英方廿四日致找照會中，希望對九龍城事件之解決能使管轄權與勒遷事分別處置一點，實極困難。同時，我外部官員廿九日亦不否認談判涉及基本原則，急切難獲完全協議。某高級官方人士曾與記者討論九龍城乃至全部九龍種界地之前途問題，渠亦承認若干推理，　自民國冊二年元月中·英新約簽字後，中·英間一切關係，包括糊利與義務，均應以中·英新約之平等互惠精神重新估計。關於九龍租借地，我方雖爲戰時盟邦設想，未同時收回，但亦經聲明保留權利，在法律本身言，新約勝於舊約，九龍租借地之存在，無疑違反條約精神，而爲不平等條約之最後殘餘，故如吾人於適當時機提出此一問題，我人之盟國必無軍絕考慮之理由，更如在任何　機不能避免涉及此一問題，吾人自不擬規避，是以今日九龍城事件之交涉將伸延至何種程度，實不敢預料限定，胥視雙方妥協可能之尺度而定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據民社黨某負責人談：外傳本黨將競選總統及副總統，絕無其事。國代當選名單，因有種種困難，將與立委當選之名單同時公告。受政黨提名補充辦法影響之國大代表候選人二百餘人，政府擬設立一半官性之機構加以容納，民社黨府委徐傅霖對此主張甚力。</p>
<h3>北煤加强南運　可望大量供</h3>
<p>張希爲赴平商運輸　　〔本報天津廿九日電〕關於加强北煤南運，解決江南煤荒，經滬燃管會主委張希爲北來奔走，已有大量供應希望，開　煤斤總積存達八十萬噸，正亟待外運，困難僅在運輸，張氏及開　　暨津燃管曾負實人已聯袂赴平，謁李宗仁·傳作義，請確保北寗路，並將訪平津路局長石志仁，請大量運輸。近剿匪總部對護路展開新措施，北煤南運情形可改善。</p>
<h3>厦海關連續破獲　黃金走私案兩起</h3>

<h3>走私大本營　自港移澳門</h3>
<p>商人逃稅多將貨物運澳　　〔本報廣州廿九日電〕中港緝私協定技術問題，經丁貴堂抵港治商後，已吿解決，日內即可實施，我將在港方若干地段設立關卡，並派員與港海關共同施行檢查。頃悉：港方商人爲逃稅計，又多將貨物運往澳門，刻再由澳門私運內地，此舉已使澳門取香港「走私大木營」之地位而代之，邇來自港運澳貨物之多，爲復員來所未見，除烟酒外，均可免稅，故走私日盛，澳門當局苟不協助緝私　　港協定仍將難奏實效。</p>
<h3>救濟特捐督委會　定下月一日成立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕院救濟特捐督導委會，定二月一日成立，各區募隻委會，則限於二月十五日以前成立。政院督導委會設主任秘書一人，推梁定由頴交担任。</p>
<h3>主席接见林崇墉　對漢口金融管事有重要指示　林報告引導游資從事生產計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕蔣主席廿九日下午四時半接見漢口市金融管理局長林崇墉，埀詢漢市金融概况及管理情形，對林氏過去在漢執行政府法令，取締非法錢莊，種稱努力，表示慰勉，並希其回漢從繼續努力，仍本旣定方針，執行金融管制。蔣主席並提出重要指示，謂金管局之任務，在於穩定金融，使游資不致作祟，以達到物價穩定，盼林能達成此目標。林氏並報吿其擬具之引導游資從事牛產之計劃，主席頗爲嘉納。林氏廿九日上午並曾謁張羣及兪部長鴻鈞等，報吿在漢執行管制金融經過，常晚夜車赴滬，將謁張嘉璈，有所請示與商談，二三日內來京即轉返漢。</p>

<h3>慰問市長痛惜敎育！</h3>
<p>日昨本市醞釀已久的同濟大學風潮終於擴大，亂且擴大的情勢，筒直非常理所可測度。吳市長昨晨爲應同濟學生之請求，親赴該校設法調解，不料反被學生羣衆兇毆；幸而市長極度忍耐，雖在被學生擬毆仆地之　，猶復大聲疾呼，力阻在塲軍警不得開槍，使蓄意製造羣衆慘案的陰謀份子，無所施其技。吳市長這種氣度，這種精神，實在可佩。他從上午走進了同濟，下午被毆以後，一直到深夜，還　終在學校附近，堅持學風必須整飭，午飯晚餐　沒有下嚥。爲地方，爲敎育，市長這樣苦幹，我們尤其要敬致深摯的慰問。</p>
<p>同濟大學學生組織自治會，旣不遵照敎育部頒發的章則，丁校長不予承認，這是應該的。學生縱有　由，儘可　情陳述，乃動輒罷課，少數學生甚且將舖蓋搬入敎室，盤據不去，阻撓其餘有心讀書的同學，也只好聽他們擺佈，這已非尋常學生應有的行動。學校當局擇其首要，分別予以開除學籍或留校察看之處分，也是職分以內無可非　之舉。而况就是這些處分，學生如果要懇求學校從寬，則有敎授在，有老校友在，他們　可排解，何以學生竟要堅持大隊入京請願？尤可怪者，此僅爲同濟之事，與他校無涉，乃昨天先後竟有若干大學中學的學生，結隊前往，聲言歡送，自稱「打氣」·試問：各校學生當初入校，究抱何種　的？迨大隊集結同　以後，紛呶喧囂之不足，最後竟出於動手行兇，毆辱市長，以堂堂學府的靑年，行動乖張至於如此，當復成何體統？數十年來，國家興辦敎育，不知耗費若干金錢，社會重視靑年，不知寄予何等原望，而今落得這般現象，我們不但爲靑年子弟惜，尤不禁爲民族前途痛哭！</p>
<p>同濟風潮，今旣鬧到如此，舉一反三，我們以爲敎育當局必須下一番大決心，澈底整頓學風；否則因循敷衍，但求粉飾一時，將來必更無可收拾。無論　育長官或學校師長，如再不把學校的頹風糾正過來，那不但害了靑年，抑且愧對學牛家長，愧對國家民族。毆辱市長的暴行學生，必須依法餒予懲戒；其他已受開除的分子更宜勒令離校。至於他校學生，自應由各校校長分別領回，予以管束或處分，而冒充學生混入搗亂的陰謀份子，和懷挾共匪傳單小冊在塲散播的盲從份子，在此動員　亂期問，尤常繩之以法，勿使共異圖得逞。須知今天情勢，業已顯然，同濟風潮，實在已非單純的學校內部問題，而爲潛伏滬市的陰謀份子爲共匪製造騷動的一環。前天宣司令和吳市長旣經聯合發表談話，重視冬防，嚴維治安，則對於此類想假薪學校風潮，利用靑年來做他們騷動資本的陰謀，自宜竭其全力預爲防範，以遏止動亂的萌芽。</p>
<p>古人說：「履霜堅冰至」。又說：「一葉落而知天下秋。」我們從同　這次風潮，可以看出兩點：</p>
<p>第一，學風之敗壞，不自今日始，而今日如果還不痛加整頓，力矯頹風，則由秋而冬，肅殺氣象更將不堪設想。學生去年打過局長，今年打了市長，這樣下去，學生變了打手，打風遍地，國家社會爲什麼還要培養這些打手？我們明知這不過少數橫暴之徒的行爲，決非多數善良學生所願見，然而多數善良學生一盤散沙，沒有組織，只讓那些少數「職業的學生」結合了橫衝直撞，眞成了害羣之馬。師嚴而後道尊，我們今天要呼籲整頓學風·尤其要請求政府和社會十二萬分的尊師重道，使品學兼優的敎師負起領導學生的責任，同時盡一切可能的力量，安定學校的環境，維護一般善良學生求學的權利。</p>
<p>第二，年來辦敎育，忽略了一個根本之點，就是做人的道理。一般學校，不論大學中學，不論文科實科，敎師先生能够在傳授知識而外，隨時隨地，身體力行，敎靑年學生以如何做人之道的，目下已如鳳毛麟角。甚至敎師們究竟能够認議幾個受敎的學生，還成問題。師生之間，旣無情感，更談小到人格的感召：不但一出校門，便成陌路，就述講堂課室，也早視同茶館酒樓。在這樣的環境裏，優良敎師只有在暗地裏歏氣，無可作為。而粗製濫造出來的一批青年學子，又往往自視甚高，不可一世，禮貌不講，處心全無，將來怎麼能希望他們担當大任，目前又怎麼能希望他們認識時代？自然，百步之內，必有芳草，十室之邑，必有忠信。青年學生中當然有眞正愛國求學的人才，國家社會對他們的期望永久是殷切的。然而頹風所及　橫流待挽。假使我們主持敎育的當局還要諱疾忌醫，假使負社會物望的人士還只知媚羣阿衆，不肯指止迷途，改弦易轍，那在五年十年之後，其毒害之貽於國家者，眞不知要到什麼地步？昨天同濟學生的暴行，還不過是小焉者耳！</p>

<h3>積極失去西德改革計劃英美法進行協商法堅持反對中央集權制</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕西方強國關於西德問題之洽商，已有積極的進展。繼英法美三國專家成立　電煤氣逐步完全併入法國經濟之協議後，英外部發言人複聲明，對於法國向英美所擬　弗闌克福英美合併區改革決議所提之建議案，正給予最鄭重的考慮。弗闌克福決議案因此將有修改，並非不可能。由此可見英美當局不待英美法一，強於二月中旬在倫敦舉行關於德國未來地位之會議，即將依據法國意見略事修正後新決議，付諸施行。此舉不啻以既成事實，向英美法三強之會議提出。在此等情形下，法國之再度提出抗議，殆在意料之中。關於三強會議之會　官方雖尚未有透露，但若西德未來的經濟地位，在會中獲得詳細之討論，則荷比盧三國勢必要求充分參加意見。荷比盧最後果能會同英美法參加魯爾區之國際管制政權，則法國之恐懼德國之再起，以及弗闌克福之可能成立集權的德國中央政府當可爲之大減。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕據悉：法國就德境英美合併區當局建議的改革計劃而向倫敦華盛頓提出之照會，建議於合併區設立扣，給與德國諸邦及邦議會以若幹集中的權力，以加強德國之聯邦性質。法國之建議包含五點，係以問題方式提出，計有㈠邦議會之權力，何以羅弗闌克福執行委員會之權力爲小；㈡征稅權何以給與中央行政機構而不給予邦政府；㈢何以不使咨詢委員會任命執行委員會之主席，而由經濟委員會任命；㈣何以不使各省總長與其等級官員在弗闌克福合併辦事，而須由兩國獨立當局在不同水凖之下行使職權；㈤關於合併區中央法院之議，何不允每邦得有司法長一人，由該邦總理任命。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕法外部發言人評述最近德境英美合併區行政改革之新決議時，認爲英美業已步入走向行政無能，或重建集權德國之道路。法政府已恰如爲會英美，就前項決議提出具體意見，並法國何以採取保留態度之理由。法車認爲對付德國各邦之態度，非爲向各邦呼　合作，即爲使用壓力以　願各邦代表之權力，後者必致引起德國中央政府之重建，卒至再有極權制度的出現。</p>
<h3>義法組經濟聯盟　兩國向美提出計劃綱要英義經濟談判已告結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕義法駐美大使已向國務部提出初步報告，其中包括法義兩國成立經濟同盟之可能性。此一維持提出此項報告後，表示法義經濟同盟不僅包括關稅同盟，且包括聯合兩國農業及工業，使物資勞工有更妥當的分配。龐氏並曰，渠與義大使泰契亞尼曾與洛維特討論如何使此一經濟同盟擴大至於他國，若荷比盧集團等。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿八日電〕英義在倫敦舉行之經濟商談，歷時十五日，今宣告結束，並發表聲明稱，商談範圍，包羅廣泛之經濟及財政方面諸項目，例如兩國間貨物之大宗交換，就英鎊之一般地位，在義國兌換市場中訂定英鎊與美元之比值，以及兩國間之貿易。聲明中並未提及對任何重要問題已否獲致協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬廿八日電〕義外相史福薩在一短報告中述及交國外交政策，謂義政府對英國所提出組織西歐各國聯盟之建議，現取密切觀察之態度。</p>
<h3>荷比盧三國　舉行聯席會議</h3>
<p>商討經濟進一步合作</p>
<p>〔路透社盧森堡廿八日電〕消息靈通方面稱，荷蘭比利時盧森堡之三國內閣聯合會議，定明日在此舉行，將起草共同宣言，以答椱覆英法之締結五國同盟建議，及貝文外相建立西歐聯盟之主張。該會原僅屬技術性的傳言，以討論統一三國關稅以及其他貿易問題爲目的。惟自貝文之學說發表後。西歐局勢産生新的發展遂使引會成爲具有重大意義的政治性會議。再者荷比盧之關稅統一，於一月一日實現後，經濟舍併之第一階段已告完成，其第二階段滿好玩　此次會議後展開。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社白魯塞爾廿九日電〕比總理史巴克昨晚在全國婦女協會中發表學說，宣稱，蘇聯現在進行一防衛計劃。彼必需獲得一最後勝利，以防衛其本身，目前之行動即欲造成此戰略上之防衛區域，此爲蘇聯反對馬歇爾計劃之主要原因。蓋蘇聯不希望歐洲各國之複興以威脅其安全也。史氏繼稱，共産主義誠有一國際性之威脅，但不信蘇聯正進行帝國主義。</p>
<h3>馬卿贊同法郎貶值</h3>
<p>認爲有助歐洲複興</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿八日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日宣稱：法國欲在援歐計劃之規範內　行其任務，則貶值實屬必需。但此次貶值已形成一種誤解，馬氏堅認貶值之舉，對於法國在援歐計劃中應盡之任務，決無任何不利之後果，且謂法郎貶值乃與十六國在巴黎會議中擬定之文件相附合。馬氏謂在此文件中，每一與會之國家皆會保證穩定本國之傾向及預算。馬氏繼稱，援歐計劃中曾提出穩定幣制之需要，故法郎之貶值乃爲接近援歐計劃建議之一步驟。渠謂英國及國際貨幣基金與法國之意見分歧，對貶值並無影響，而僅影響於實行之方法。最後馬宣稱，法郎貶值並不影響美洲輸歐之援助總額，蓋一切原料及物品皆以差不多償付。</p>
<h3>收回法郎大票</h3>

<p>全國各銀行休業兩日</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：巴黎訊，法國民議會財政委會拒絕接受政府所提收回全部五千法郎票面之紙幣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿八日電〕今夜據悉，許曼總理已與社會黨史對於政府所提黃金自由買賣案成立協議，仙閣危機漸見緩和，該案可　以數票之差，通過議會，但社會黨閣員是否繼續供職，尚屬疑問。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕法政府今日下令法國各銀行一律休　兩日，以免議會　　黃金自由買賣案時發生投機。法政府並下令暫時禁止以五千法郎券作交易媒介。</p>
<h3>三頭會議事　馬卿不表示意見</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾頃於本日接見新聞記者，有詢以　蘇英三國將否舉行三強會議，以詩集當前世界重要問題一事，但馬卿拒不加以答覆，僅謂，此事在與杜魯門總統加以研究之前，目前尚未能置答。</p>
<h3>對六十八億元援歐數額馬歇爾反對削減　惟於管理方面可作讓步</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕馬歇爾國務卿聞悉國會內支持馬歇爾議案之人士，擬提折衷建議，以削減援歐總額，藉以避免更鉅額的削減後，即表示渠之堅決反對對最初十五個月內之援歐費用六十八億元，作任何之削減。但渠　明凖備接受關於議案其他部份之妥協建議主，包括范登堡所主張不予國務部以否決權，僅予國務卿以對方案管理人提出有關外交問閒建議之權之議。　接近范登堡之人稱，參院外委會已暫定減少最初十五個月內援助費至五十五億元，藉以避免更　額之削減。</p>
<h3>兩院外交委會聆取各方意見</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕前　國務卿艾克遜告衆院外委會，認爲歐洲複興方案，乃美國安全的第一道防線。指出蘇聯正盡其力量，以阻止歐洲之複興，西歐如能恢複自立的能力，美蘇間之關係亦可隨之改善。艾氏促國會批准最初十五個月內之援歐費用六十八億元，力主不可減少。實力雄厚控制全國大部份主要工業及銀行之「全國製造商協會」向衆院外委會提出書面意見；主張不予實行社會主義的車營政策之國家以援助，並主張設立無黨派委員會，不受國務部之干涉，管理馬歇爾議案。前參議員被認有出任馬歇爾方案總管理之拉福來德，在參院外委會陳辭，力主馬歇爾方案應由國務部管理。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕法外部發言人被詢及薩爾經濟之併入法國，尚有何項步驟須待完成時，答曰，待完成者已不多，祇薩爾區與外界尤其是德國之一般商務關係，尚待部署而已，關於此事談判正在進展中。</p>

<h3>日決定得勝外資　擬定方針防止外商操縱僅接受貸欵不歡迎投資</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿九日電〕今日日內閣會議決定運用外資方針時對重興戰後日本工業之舉有一驚人之決議，其議決各點爲：㈠在各主要工業方面接受貸款，但不歡迎外商投資；㈡°數種亟需外資之工業上，政府將允許外商加入　　事之職；㈢國外投資必須與國外之原料同時進口，如是始能獲得日本之准許，至於此種原料之等級與輸入之辦法，則另訂之；㈣宗教性，文化性及旅行性之事業，歡迎外國投資，但與日本有至要關係之工業，則不歡迎之。對於此數項決議，外籍觀察家認爲日本在此接受外資以振興工業之際，已在擬定其將來之經濟政策，此政策之趨勢與戰前之政策相類似，今後對外資將極度審慎處理，以防止他國掌握其工業。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿八日電〕據生絲業管理局　告稱，日本目前之生絲産量約爲戰前産量最高年一九三〇年之六分之一，每月産量一萬包左右，目前將維持此標凖。</p>

<p>〔合衆社報達廿九日電〕新近辭職之加比總理，懼爲人所逮捕，已乘飛機逃往外約但首府安曼。新內稅似將全部採取反英立場，雖英國在伊擁有巨大之石油特權及英空軍根據地兩處，亦在所不計。廿七日伊人萬名舉行反英大示威，發生糾紛，二十人殞命，另有二百卅五人受傷，攝政乃宣佈英伊新約無效。理由爲該約允許英國在伊續用機場兩處，受有戰爭威脅時，且可遣軍入伊境。該約被認爲有損伊拉克主權。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕外約但已要求修改整個一九四六年之英外條約，並不僅以檢討該約之軍事附約爲限。此項檢討固此次英外會談原定之目標。然悉外約但代表團已提出英外條約之新草案，由於此項發展，於今日舉行會談之後，已決定展期兩天後續開會議。外約但引舉雖出英方意料，然英國目前正力謀與阿拉伯世界成立新條約系統，故料貝文對於外約但之要求修改整個條約，不致率真予以拒絕。</p>
<h3>美貓「援歐」</h3>

<h3>建立巴爾幹聯邦計劃東歐共産黨意見紛歧　英倫人士重視蘇報論調</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕此間外交界人士對於蘇聯共黨機關報趔報廿八日所刊載之評論，公然表示不贊成由巴爾幹諸國會同波捷合組巴爾幹聯邦，若保總理狄米特洛夫可建議者，感覺極度興起。東歐共黨史政見之分歧，於此已爲之顯示，莫斯科之反對在蘇聯以外組織包括波捷等國之斯拉夫聯盟，已以最明顯的方式爲之聲明。</p>
<p>狄米特洛夫之脫離去年十月九共産國際情報局成立宣言由規定之國家獨立政策，已由莫斯科公然促起其汴意，消息靈通方面相信，趔報之拒不支持狄米特洛夫之變動蘇聯以外的斯拉夫聯邦，係基於下列原因：㈠蘇聯決保持　其在泛斯拉夫運動中之領導地位。㈡保加利亞希望使工業比較先進的波蘭及捷克參加斯拉夫聯邦，以扶助工業比較後進的巴爾幹南方諸國，並不爲蘇聯所造成。㈢莫斯科認爲共産國家之政策，祇能由莫斯科決定，蘇聯願意捷波之貿易在莫斯科監督之下發展，而不願其在未有管制的巴爾幹工業化計劃下獲得發展。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕美國務院今日主宰已接獲蘇聯對美國在利比亞重設空軍基地之抗議書。僉信國務院尚未提出答覆。其他方面稱，當美國與黃曆進行談判時，完全遵守對義和約。對義和約第廿三條規定所有義殖民地，包括利比亞在內，「最後之處理」當由四強在簽訂和約後一年內共同決定。然附件中規定如四強不能獲得協議，引總量當提交聯合國。四強在巴黎各會中對此既未得協議，乃同意在作最後決定前，各殖民地仍由英國管理也。</p>

<p>莫萊－－「控制總統的人物」</p>
<p>倫敦經濟會議固然令人失望，但也有幾個比較輕快的場面。赫爾夫人和我曾出席進英王喬治的宴會。事前，我們已經計劃好作一次郊外的閒遊，需要我們離開宴會到離城幾項裏的鄉間去。我設法想使會議有所成就，苦無充分條件，當時的緊張情緒，使我疲乏異常，處境如此，我覺得無論如何應該休息一下。出席英王宴會的貴賓雲集，包括六十六國的代表，備形熱鬧。我等待了相當時間之後，覺得再等下去要使我們的旅行不可能了。於是我就建議，主張我的同伴和我應該悄然離開，不給任何人注意。我無法獲得一條捷徑十目所視英王。後來我得悉當我剛離開的時候，英王就派人來召我，但真曉得我已經不在場了，於是我就通知適當的英國官吏，說明假如英王同意，我希望雲晉謁他。我立即接到答覆，表示贊同。我發覺英王極民主，他誠懇地接見我，並且對美國人民深致贊揚。繼而我們就倫敦會議及其目標約談三十分鍾，空氣和諧友好。我們同意議程上所列各項題目的重要性，以及每一題目必須獲致適當解決的必要。英王表示在會議的較後階段，希望再遇見我一次；不幸此一時機終未到來。</p>
<p>會議的一籌莫展，已經呈露明顯的徵象。就在那時候，我得到消息，說總統正派莫萊到倫敦來，作爲聯絡人員，以便將華盛頓方面最近的發展通知我們。關於莫萊乘坐飛機到羅斯福先生的游艇上去見總統的戲劇性演出以及關於莫萊離開華盛頓　和紐約　的種種喧鬧和猜測，開始在報紙上紛傳，彷彿在使各地民衆獲得一種印象，就是說他到倫敦來，是帶有總統的新訓令或者一種新意見的，甚至可能接管美國代表團。從那時候起的以後七天裏，他正在海上，會議也在等待時機。倫敦報紙以大號頭條標題刊登消息，說莫萊－－「這個控制總統的人物」－－正在到倫敦來照顧美國在那裏的利益。巴黎報紙渲染得更厲害，對我極爲魯莽無禮，指出我夫能替我的政府處理當前的局勢。</p>
<p>方面對莫萊的招待空前熱烈，其程度僅次於招待帝王。高級官吏的代表團。新聞記者和其他人物。感情衝動，急忙到普裏穆斯去迎接他，爭相致敬。他到倫敦之後，就到辦事處來訪問我，和我握手，向我致意，並且和代表團會晤。報界希望他招待記者，我就伴他前往，但是甘自退縮在後，而在新聞記者的眼中，莫萊彷彿是美國人中唯一值得見一見的人物。其後，我就極少遇見莫萊，下至最後的危機到臨。我決定把一切他所需要的工具放在他手裏，看他在倫敦這種局勢之下，能夠維持多久。</p>
<p>他到倫敦不久之後，莫萊就傳言給我，要我向代表團傳達一項消息，說他想集中注意力於穩定通貨問題。他立即開始和財政大臣張伯倫（Ncville　Chamberlain）以及英國財部經濟顧問李滋　斯（Frekcrick　Leith　Ross）進行談話。據說第一次會議是在美國大使館舉行的，莫萊就躭擱在那裏。</p>
<p>在其後向天裏，各國政府的首相，總理和其他最高級官員，爭欲與莫萊會晤，好比他是一個「具有魔力的吹簫者」。我繼續退縮在後，彷彿我是最不重要的人物，猶如會議的一個累贅。</p>
<p>有一次　唐納首相問我：「你能不能呌莫萊來見我？我想同他談話。」其後他轉了一個念頭，加上一句說，「假如你高興，也可以來。」</p>
<p>幾天之後，麥詔納呌我進去，對我說話的神氣，彷彿是先生對一個小學生講書。他說，「在這樣一個會議中，習慣上是不宜向報界發表聲明的（我發表了一兩個），你知道嗎？簡直不行。」</p>
<p>我反駁說，「另一個代表團的領袖，越過了我，跟著和我的一個屬員直接商談，習慣上也不見得更通常。」</p>
<p>但是從各方面說，麥唐納是一個可敬愛的人物，能力極佳，談吐流暢。在任何團體之中，不久就能引人注意。他是一個博覽群書的學者，一般常識，驚人豐富，特別是有關政府的常識。</p>
<p>若幹主要外交代表和若幹外國報紙隨便在講莫萊到倫敦來，不僅是以聯絡人員的身份，而是以總統代表身份來的，賦有充份力量，其程度猶在代表團之上。莫萊對比，早有所知，當這種消息迅速在英倫傳佈，歐洲大陸的態度對代表團尤其是對我顯　不利時，莫萊在各國首相，總理以及高級權貴角逐之下，在行動上彷彿他是完全代表美國政府的；雖然他表面上對一邞佔有這促地位的說素，屢表抗議和否認。</p>
<p>莫萊談判好了穩定通貨的一個協定，並且用電報報告總統，請他批准。他自們甚強，以爲總統一定會接受他的意見，所以他竟通知英國和其他政府的高級官吏，說他將在六月三十日正午某時在詔甯街十號和他們會晤。不久，他就打電話到我旅館來，極懇切地要求我到唐寗街十號去，以便簽字於他認爲即將成立的協定。我迅速而直率地拒絕前往，並且堅決地說明，以我倫敦會議代表的身份，對於穩定通貨問題　不相干。他不斷懇請，但是我打斷了他再作談話的嘗試。</p>
<p>這種離奇的情形不能長久，勢必要來一次攤牌而告結束。這種演出，隨著總統的一個電報回來，他拒絕了莫萊所建議的協定。那時候，我正凖備出發到　裏維登去，當我走出門來到旅館的石級附近時，莫萊匆匆地趕下來見我，並且說：「華盛頓來了一個電報，對穩定通貨是不利的。我們必須設法才是。」</p>
<p>於是我就看他怒目而視。我知道他已經　黔驢技窮，一切都完了。我開始同他講話。我開頭說：「你還是以回去爲宜。第一，你在這裏沒有應該幹的事情」。我在這幾方面翻覆說明。於是我走到我的汽車上去，到鄉間去度周末，因爲在友好　經敦促之後，我已經答應赴約了。</p>
<p>當我回到倫敦的時候，總統有名的「炸彈演說」已經　傳到，其由對莫萊的穩定通貨建議力予拒絕，並且用堅強的口吻向倫敦會議申述意見。總統說，假如會議任令自己把注意力從更廣泛的問題轉移到一種純粹是人爲的，臨時試驗性質的，僅足以吳市吹簫少數國家傾向轉換的建議，他認爲「這將是一種災禍，不啻世界的悲劇」。這個消息，使會議中羣情喧騰。</p>
<p>在這個演說到達幾小時之後，我國代表團副署長柯克斯（James　M.Cox）州長趕到我的辦公室來；他的工作的一部份，就是我規定好的他每天應該會見麥詔納。他來時感情極爲激動，說：「英國和其他國家爲了總統的演說，憤慨到如此程度，決定在今日正午召開指導委員會會議，再由該委會於明日召開全體大會，然後在大會中宣佈會議無限期休會。在決議中，它們將以破壞會議的全部責任，完全套在總統的頭上」。</p>
<p>我集中全力去阻止這種發展，以謀在尚未到不可收拾的程度之前，合形勢恢複寗靜。</p>
<p>我去見麥唐納；我陽懇切地勸他修正態度，並且說和句贊成會議常會繼續召開的說話。他極銳利地說他無意出此。他普通勞動者不堪地訴說總統的演說在破壞會議之，也使他的－－麥唐納的－－政治地位摧毀殆盡。在他，本來想靠會議的成功而使他的地位增強的。我已經得到消息，就是麥唐納在私人談話之中，曾經說過現在或許不得不辭去首相的職位了。</p>
<p>當指導委員會重開之時，縱使略有好轉，希望依然極爲渺茫。</p>
<p>我設法獲得發言的機會，致開會詞約二十分鍾。我離持我原來的立志，力當世界六十六國對於召開此次會議以及由會議採取行動解決或亟等改善的許多個融財政問題，已一致同意其絕對必要，除非任令整個國際繼續　接近完令　饋的　度。</p>
<p>各國代表繼起演說，有支持麥唐納的，有支持我的。加拿大首相貝納特（Bennett）日本的石井，和瑞典代表，堅決支持我的立場。張伯倫也贊成我的意見。</p>
<p>我們反對休會的論據，相當動人，頗有擊破英法計劃的力量，所獲結果，使我覺得很突兀，猶如使我覺得驚奇一樣。甚至麥唐納首相也游離了他原來的立場，和我們一起向反對方向行動。經過二小時的辯論之後，大會同意會議應繼續開下去。</p>
<p>其後的三星期中，都是紙上談兵，當時我們蒐尋可以討論的零星題材。</p>
<p>莫萊回國去了。事前，他發一個電報給總統，就性質上講，是對代表團作一嚴厲檢討的報告。他聲言整個代表團未能在會議中代表總統，僅畢德曼爲例外。事實上，畢德曼是貢獻最少的一個人。他對於白銀問題的決議案雖屬例外，但是極少數人對它發生興趣。莫萊很天真地把這個電報用國務院的密碼發出，內容被美國代表團所獲悉。除了畢德曼之外，每一個代表對之不勝憎恨。</p>
<p>七月二十七日夜，我乘「哈定總統」號返國。在離開倫敦之前，我接到總統一個電報：「在你啓程之前，我希望你再曉得一次我對你的敬愛和信任。你應付了重大的困難。精神可嘉，並且經由你自己的勇氣和誠意，挽救了國際繼續討論世界複難問題的原則，免於瓦解，未使更進一步的考慮成爲不可能。當你下星期抵達紐約之時，我將在海德公園，極希望你和赫樂夫人當夜就來。」</p>
<p>我應該說明，從那時候起，總統決定他不擬再以任何特權給予莫萊，至於管轄美國代表團的權力，更不必說了。這是出諸總統自己的意志。他說他的意思，祇不過呌莫萊以聯絡人員的身份到倫敦來一趟，把代表團可能希望獲得的消息帶來，並在幾天之後返美，把總統可能希望從分工負責愛國者　那裏獲得的消息帶回。他告訴我說，各界對莫萊到倫敦的消息大吹大擂，以及莫萊對外界傳說加以鼓勵或予以默認，或者兩種心理兼而有之，用心昭然若揭，此點合極爲震驚。總統派給莫萊一些將要的工作，不多幾星期之內，把他調出國務院。</p>

<h3>市長橫遭歐擊忍辱調停同濟學潮解決今可複課抄出共匪宣傳品被捕諸生候訊究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕同濟大學學生一千餘人，昨長因欲晉京請願，吳市長應校方之邀，生産秩序勸阻，不意橫遭歐辱，致引起軒然大波。其美路上自最至暮，軍警密佈，戒備森嚴，整日陷於紛擾與緊張之狀態中。尚幸軍警雖在學生　擊之下，始終忍耐不加抵抗，得未發生流血事件。市長對此事件始終保持冷靜之態度，便聲明此事幕後顯有共匪從中煽動，企圖藉此贊成流血事件，而旭罪於政府。</p>
<p>學生與當局相持直至今晨二時，始告解決，商談結果，由各級級長具結負責勸導學生於今日下午全體複課。市長與宜司令離開其美路時，已爲今晨二時零五分。總計市長爲調解此事而駐留同濟校外，前後達十五小時之久。同時同濟附近之康隴酒坊竟形成黨政軍臨時聯合辦事處，一時冠蓋雲集，亦豈始料所及哉。</p>
<h3>學生開始行動軍警嚴密戒備</h3>
<p>此事之起因，係月前因學生要求修改部頒新自治會會章未獲允准，及學生兩名被開除後，要求收回成命未果，始有昨日之一幕紛擾髮生。</p>
<p>當學生計劃晉京請願之前夕，當局爲避免事態擴大，曾由警察局長俞叔平於深夜二時親往校內勸阻，但直談至三時，學生方面仍堅持原議。</p>
<p>至昨晨一時許，同濟各學院學生遂開始行動，陸續同其美路同濟工學院集合，校內人數逐漸增至一千餘人。彼等計劃於八時前往北站購票，搭車晉京請願。是時複有複旦大學，同濟附職，暨附中一意中人學生組織「歡送團」，前往歡送，軍警當局已於事前在校院四周來回戒備，斷絕交通，於是「歡送者」與「請願者」僅能隔牆呌喊，引呼彼應，情形漸見緊張，但這；警方和滿佈哨崗外，未有所動。</p>
<p>如是相持至十時三十五分，校內學生忽自一未加戒備之邊門中，奮鬥而出，一時情形益見緊張，軍警當即迅速列隊阻止，馬隊在前，軍警殿後，轉瞬間，仍將校外工道團團圍住，故學生雖衝出校門，但仍未能突圍而出也。</p>
<h3>市長到場勸阻</h3>
<p>此時學校方面即電知市長，請往調解。迨市長應邀前往，到達其美路，時已十時三刻。市長下車後，即與學生談話，但學生方面因人多嘴雜，意見不一，擒秩序頗爲混亂。市長謂對此次事件，甚表關心，但請願之舉，依法祇准代表十人，如學生方面能依法推出代表晉京，本人當極願加保護與協助。嗣有學生代表二人要求市長出面調解，並要求市長下令撤退軍警。至此，情形原已由緊張而轉趨和緩，不料正在繼續談判之際，適又有法學院，光華，大夏，聖約翰，紹興中學，南通學院，不吳，同德，中國女中，愛羣女中，在同附中等校學生千餘人，亦組織「歡送團」相繼到達，手持旗幟，高唱口號，聲勢浩大，因而同濟學生受此激動，情絡又轉趨囂張，呌喊之聲於是重複四起。</p>
<h3>徵得學生同意組織五人委會</h3>
<p>時有筣具政治系學生張渝明者，適於此際爲驚馬所踢傷，於是學生藉此事故，呌囂益厲，情形混亂，軍警方面即將傷者擡至同濟附近之「康隴酒坊」內，市長聞訊，遂亦前往探視，並即令遂陸軍醫院療治，時學生責問者有之，漫罵者有之市長當即出外解釋：謂此事過失不在警察，實由於學生騷動，致馬受驚。正談話間，學生大隊一度向前猛衝，市長罅不理，隨即向衆提出警告：「如大隊再往前行，發生不幸事件時，責任應由自治會代表負責」。學生聞語，始稍和緩。市長繼又加以勸慰，一面並答應出面調解，絕對主持公道，判明是非。同時並建議組織一「五人委員會」，正式進行調解。其五人之組織，即由學生方面推出教授一人，校友一人，學校方面推出教授一人，校友一人，會同市長本人共同進行調解。當時學生方面隨即提出教授楊烈及校友黃伯樵兩人。時同濟校長丁文淵適正在公訓同學會招待校友新聞界報告此次事件經過，市長遂派人前往通知，請其迅速推出代表參加「五人委員會」。</p>
<p>事件演變至此，似又轉趨明朗，學生亦稍見安靜。市長以時過中午，尚滴水未進，乃與在場之新聞記者羣同往附近之「康隴酒坊」略進面食，同時又如今學生代表，詳詢此次學潮之近果與遠因。</p>
<p>如是相持至下午三時半，學生方面之教授代表楊烈首先報到，但推舉之校友代表黃伯樵，則稱因病未能前來。惟校方代表則迄未報到，僅悉是時之同濟校長丁文淵，已趕往市府，靜候各代表前往商談。</p>
<h3>大混亂序幕揭開　扭住吳市長全身遭踢打呢帽眼鏡煙鬥一齊失落</h3>
<p>正當此際前面隊伍中忽見騷動，傳來同濟法學院二年級學生趙仁保被捕之消息。市長當即步出酒坊，前往調查，大混亂之序幕，於焉開始。當市長到達學生之先烈前，即聞學生羣由紛紛呌喊不已，或稱被捕二人，或稱被捕五六人，經市長詢問警察結果，承認捕獲學生一人，已解送派出所內，市長當飭令釋放，但因派出所與校址間有相當距離，往返費時，故稍等不至，學生又起騷動，大隊忽又向前猛衝，進埋伏路旁田內之學生，早已集有多最碎石，但聞一聲呼喊之後，即見滿天飛石，紛紛投落軍警隊伍與馬隊之中，一時形勢大亂，馬騎受驚，警士當場即有八人受傷。更有一意中人學生就近又將市長包圍，首先搶走其頭戴之呢帽，繼用竹棍棒紛擊其頭部，當時市長尚擬趨避，但旋爲學生將其領帶拉住，複扼其頸部，　至泥地上在其級腰腿部，拳足交加，市長此時猶恐警士不能忍耐，尚高聲命令警士不准開槍。正在此危急之承，始由少數警員衝入人羣中，將市長搶救而出。但此時市長已搶劫其終日不能離身之眼鏡與煙鬥，且滿身泥跡，頭髮蓬亂。</p>
<h3>學生肇禍退入院內</h3>
<p>市長雖遭歐辱，但態度始終保持冷靜，重複回至酒坊內，是時學生知已肇禍，遂亦紛紛退入工學院內，惟在混亂中，捕獲一擔任「交通糾察」之同濟機械系新生龔紹熊，渠爲一年僅二十歲之湖南湘潭人，在其袋內搜獲反動宣傳文件兩件，當即解送警備部查訊。</p>
<h3>吳市長在酒坊內對記者發表談話</h3>
<p>市長在酒坊內，曾對記者發表談話，迫述其被歐辱之經過稱：「先是學生羣由於稽延不耐，開始高喊「打，打」旋即衝向警察，企圖將其逐退。其中二人將餘按下，並以竹杖歐擊。餘敵戴帽，致被拉去，眼鏡亦遭拆碎。餘力言將張令防止警察開槍，但彼等高喊「勿讓他起來」。俟起立，餘即下令不准暴動，若非親自在場，必將此起流血。此舉無疑係受共匪從中主使，蓋欲藉此製造流血事件，而歸罪政府。一意中人學生身上曾抄獲共産黨之宣傳品，可爲明證。」記者詢以能否指認凶手，市長答稱：「否，餘無眼鏡，不能看清一切也。」</p>
<p>旋有校友舒震東，　九紹，蔣益生三人到場，有所報告，市長乃再度召集學生代表談話，痛斥學生有意造成流血事件，企圖擴大變亂，此呈殊屬顯明，有共匪在幕後主使，　澈底查究，加以嚴辦。至此宜司令亦聞訊趕到，向衆宣布：「此次學生對地方行政首長竟敢公然侮辱，實爲中外所未聞，餘當嚴令交出禍首名單，否則決將加以逮捕，不稍寬貸。」</p>
<h3>軍警開入學校拘捕開除諸生</h3>
<p>時市長複提出條件三項：　限令即日複課，　交出禍首名單，　交出已被開除之學生名單。由學生代表返校開會商討答覆。少頃，又見學生代表一人帶領自稱複旦.聖約翰.及交大學生代表三人，面竭市長，但查問其學生證及在何系讀書時，則又多支吾不能答，繼卒爲在旁之學生認出其爲假冒，乃一一加以扣押。</p>
<p>迨至六時許，業已夜色深沉，同濟校長丁文淵始見其初度露面於其美路上，各大學校長亦相繼趕到，均集中酒坊內，商談善後問題。同時李熙謀.方治.曹俊.陳保泰等亦紛紛趕到，是時停放於路旁之汽車不下二三百輛之多。</p>
<p>此後，由校長方面人士往返於學校與酒坊間，傳達雙方意見，但學生始終無具體答覆，宜司令用乃下令軍警進入校內。而各大學校長及各校友此時尚多次往返勸告，但仍毫無效果，學生中一部份高呼口號，一部份則報以噓聲，遷延半小時，仍無結果。宜司令乃下令將全體學生驅出大禮堂，詎全體學生互相携手，不願離開，軍警見無法可施，遂逐一檢查其學籍證，就各學校單位強迫分開。在同濟之一組中，軍警即照該校已開除學籍之名單，即領導此次事件之學生十一人，加以逮捕，嗣查悉名單有有女生朱文秀，原在同濟三年級讀書，後忽自動降至一年級，在搜捕前已爲其家長領去，此外尚有男生黃克魯，曾停學一年，此次忽又參加，吳市長命併予逮捕。其時陶百川.謝仁劍.胡健中等亦趕到慰問市長，並共在康隴酒坊等候消息。</p>
<h3>歐辱首長凶犯發現</h3>
<p>同濟草場方面，經詳細檢查結果，發現有某某工廠工人一名，冒充學生，據稱亦爲參加此次事件而來；同時又在一假冒複旦學生之張姓青年身畔，抄出不完全之稿紙一張，上頁似已毀棄，下頁有鋼筆書：「……增強黨性，討論土地法大綱。㈡工作：（甲）萊斯社加強領導，堅決發展，在火炬社中核心工作。（乙）火炬社加強教育，作爲一個牢固基礎。」另又據調查報告，滬江及暨大並未有學生參加，但出事時滬江暨大歐市長之瞿宇平（本報攝）之校旗竟在隊列中。十一時許，軍警在同德醫學院隊伍中發現一名瞿宇平之學生，經大多數人指認即係歐辱市長四學生中之一，複經帶往市長處略加訊結，即暫加看押，市長頻囑須另善視，不可施以報複。</p>
<h3>出力軍警一律嘉獎</h3>
<p>十二時後，市長偕宜司令，俞局長等一行由酒坊移往同濟教室內，請丁校長召集同濟各級級長訓話。同時召見警局保安總隊第二部隊長王銳含及分隊長杜凱勳，杜在出事時因見市長被學生歐辱，義憤填膺，欲親率隊員出槍援救，經王棠摑斥阻，幸免流血，市長對渠等興深明大義及忠勇之沈，備致嘉慰，並表示對遵守紀律，佈置周密之全體出力人員，市府決予特別獎勵。同時此次事件中頗多中學生參加，市長極表震怒，聞將調查各約束無方之中學校，對校長予以嚴厲懲處。</p>
<p>今晨一時十分，同濟各級級長齊集聆訓，茵由市長對此次事件並不憤怒，祇　感痛心，在學生中竟查到有遠自北平清華派來參加者（該生名陳明康），足證幕後笄者陰謀造成流血，昭然若揭，善良同學受其利用，盲目衝動，違背信義。市長複反覆解釋愛國必先讀書，不糾衆鬧事爲能，最後表示除應逮捕者將來依法審訊外，其餘同學如能出具悔過書接受勸告，即日複課，當不　既往，絕對保障其學業與安全。嗣又由宜司令勸告和緩長轉告全體同學以學業爲重，即日安心複課，政府當盡力愛護。最後　由教部中等教育司長吳兆棠與丁校長說明，教部已派杭次長夜車來滬，並携有解散令，當局決不姑息，立即同濟大學。</p>
<h3>今晨二時圓滿解決</h3>
<p>經勸導多時，各級級長遂表示願負責勸導複課，並書就一筆據，交丁校長，原文：「我們對於今天所發生的事件表示遺憾，並願以級長地位盡力傳達並勸導各原級同學複課。」末並由各級長簽名，爲黃維德，週光祺，黃汝霖，張友禎，尹士傑，和根五，鄭康年，陶定國，陳印淇，薛薛，林世高，張萊，張煦，馬任標等十四人。</p>
<p>丁校長持筆據往報市長，吳認爲應加一日期，親來向各級長指示，初尚推諉，不願負此責任，終乃在原文後加一括號，誩明「盡可能於卅日下午起複課」。此一遷延多時幾經波折之學潮，遂得解決。吳市長宜司令等相繼離校返邸，時已今晨二時0五分矣。至各校學生分別由各校校點名領回。</p>
<h3>同濟約翰複旦被捕十四學生</h3>
<p>當場抄出共黨刊物</p>
<p>又昨日逮捕被認禍首學生，其在日間捕獲者有同濟虞紹羅，陳文健，張敬兒，吳虹，孫任遠，黃景純，汪紹基，章則之，蘇　我‘衡，趙仁保，張鴻年，聖約翰王振和，湯興伯，複旦賓克宏等十四名。內裴紹熊一名，湖南湘潭人，現年二十歲，同濟機械系新生。在其躺在身上搜獲共産黨在香港發行之四十九期「迎接新年」，及五十期「歐遊漫記」雜誌兩冊，當送警備司令部候究，餘均解交警察總局收押。</p>
<h3>各界今午慰問市長</h3>

<h3>訪勁旅第五軍</h3>
<p>〔本報開封廿二日訊〕這一次匪首陳毅爲解救被國軍圍困在大別山中岌岌可危的劉伯誠起見，乃　豫中國軍兵力單薄之際，親率十萬之衆，於上月間一舉而由民權以北杞縣以東地區竄至通許，陳留，尉氏，朱仙鎭，構成包圍開封的扇面形勢，欲不費吹灰之力，而奪取國軍所必不放棄的汴鄭兩軍要據點，即令不能成功，而大別山之壓力亦可减輕。如僥倖達到目的，則中原大局將完全變色。這陰謀正像一陣狂風暴雨，自十二月十二日下午就向這個沙城開始侵襲了，當時汴垣確實非常空虛，兵力單薄到可怕的程度，因之風聲鶴唳，一夕數驚，接着汴東之蘭封，羅王，興隆，汴西之山牟，邵崗，杏花營，均陷匪手，對外一切交通電訊完全斷　，雖然自十三日下午國軍有力部除進駐城垣後，已增强了城防力量，然而奸鼴已竄至大堤外，砲聲隆隆，　勢　極危殆，當此之時，汴垣數十萬市民在一個共同死的恐怖下，一面動員協助國軍加强城防，一面則默禱追剿部隊　夜到來，「安定中原的新五軍，正由柘城向西挺進」</p>
<p>這消息像一陣春風，盪漾在冰天雪地的沙城，盪漾在數十萬市民顫慄的心裏，然而「只聽樓梯饗，不見人下來！」一天兩天過去了，這陣春風仍然被寒流凍結了，數十萬紳民仍然沉浸在恐怖的深淵裏，新五軍，這枝强有力馳名國際間而共匪最恐懼的機械化部隊，却一點消息也沒有了。沙城變成了死城，恐怖的雲也艙罩着這沙城的天空。</p>
<p>突然自十七號下午起，開封外團的共匪竟偃旗息鼓，紛紛南竄了，這個歷史名城落得個「有驚無傷」，這到底是怎麼一回事呢？有的人說這是由於城防部隊的聲威造成了「姜太公在此諸神退位」的結果，有的人說匪是聲東擊西，見汴鄭難圖，已竄往平漢路各據點，且已獲得相當便宜，所以就棄汴鄭而向東南竄了，以上這兩種說法，都不爲無因，然而最重要的，還是由於第五軍在他們背後以雷霆萬鈞之力壓迫而來，挖去了他的心肺，（西進途中在睢杞一帶解決了他們最精銳的第六第八兩個縱隊）使他們聞風喪胆，不敢在汴鄭許三角地帶戀棧，而狼狽的收兵南竄了。</p>
<h3>寂寞曠野　戰車奔馳</h3>
<p>溫暖的陽光又普照着這個風沙之城，緊壓在每個市民心上那塊沉重的恐怖之雲也消散了，歡笑重新又掛在每個市民的面龐上，勞軍之聲響遍了全市，守城將士在冰天雪地中以堅苦卓終的防　，換來了市民衷心的欽敬與感激，大家殺豬宰牛慰勞他們，他們的確當之不愧。</p>
<p>直接解開封之圍的第五軍，遠在百里之外的匪區，汴垣各界正急着沒法前往　勞，正好第五軍的劉副官長於二十日率領一批戰車及百餘輛大卡車，來汴領給養，常面邀請我同去看看，我也樂得去訪問這一個久已聞名的勁旅。於是劉副官長走後，劉主席就電邀省黨部蕪主委，省參會劉議長，並電省府齊委員請他代表劉主席一同到省府集齊去慰勞新五軍。十二點半鐘我和燕主委，齊委員，劉議長代表孔參議員，保安處袁處長茂矩等五個人，帶蒲三億鈔票，分乘兩部吉普車，由劉副官長派一部大型戰車在前邊開路，另由四部武裝大卡車在後邊掩護，離開了沙城，向陳留通許以東杞縣西北的某地出發。</p>
<p>沿途在前一天還有共鼴流竄，我們雖然有戒心，但並不猶豫，然而看見遍地的野戰工事，仍不免有點觸目驚心，大小村落，多無人烟，破房茅屋，皆無門窗，戰後蕭條的景色，非身臨其境者，不能形容，戰車在落日中猛虎似的奔馳在寂寞的曠野上，更現着戰爭氣氛仍然籠罩着這塊大地。遍地都是　溝，都是障礙物，但戰車不顧一切都把它衝平了，眼看着已無路可走了，但戰車過處就自然成道，橫衝直撞，左奔右馳，逢山開路，遇水成橋，我們就這樣被戰車領導着奔過了荒村曠野，深入到昨日共匪的老巢，下午五點半鐘光景，我們跳下了車，拂去了滿身塵土，肩負着數十萬人民的熱情，進人了我們要到的那個村莊。</p>
<h3>荒村茅屋識英雄</h3>
<p>這是一個很小而且極荒凉的村落，而這個小村中就住着馳名遐邇的第五軍軍部·住着我們欽仰已久而無緣拜識的邱淸泉將軍，說起第五軍，（普通又稱新五軍）這是國際間有名的部隊，他有一都最輝煌的歷史，抗戰期問它是第二百師，裝備最好，訓練最好，戰鬥力址也最好，那時他們被派為遠征軍，印細屢次戰役他們都和盟軍並肩作戰，他們的英名從這時就震動天下了，印緬戰塲上，到處都留有他們光榮的戰蹟。光復後他們從西南被調到首都，不久他們又被調到此東剿　，那時共鼴氣熖萬丈，根本沒把他們看在眼里，可是共鼴這種　空一切的態度就在這一次給第五軍敎訓好了，他們對第五軍再不敢輕視，甚至內心里已經有點恐懼了，從此之後，第五軍就指戈北上，一直在冀。魯·豫·皖·鄂·蘇邊區進剿共匪，在他們的戰史上永遠沒有過敗奔的記載，到如今共匪已經在每個小組討論會上公開討論「如何消滅恐懼第五軍的脆弱心理」這個題目了。領導第五軍的邱清泉將軍，這更是一位　　　名將，　　二期的高材生，德國陸軍大學畢業，文能工詩詞歌賦，武能却敵千里，上馬殺賊，下馬草露布，邱將軍在現代軍人中確是一位不可多得的將才。這一枝滿身都是光榮的部隊，和這一位燦爛奪目的常勝將軍就住在這個荒凉　漠的小村莊里，而且我們馬上就可以把投，這的確是一件極快慰的事情。</p>
<p>村莊　到處都是戰車和彈藥，無數大卡車的發動機像大風一樣滿處嚮，戰馬也不停的亂呌，這里感不到恐怖，只感到緊張和興奮。我們被劉副官長引進了一個殘　骯髒的小院里，這院里只有三座矮小的茅屋，門上沒有門板，各掛着一條軍氈，窗戶上都是川蘆席堵着，在人聲鼎沸中。東屋的門簾打了開，里邊也撲出了一股燒柴的濃烟，接着又走出來了一位身材不魁偉，儀表不堂皇，四十來歲，穿着一身黃布棉軍裝的軍官，經劉副官長的介紹，我們才知道他就是我們所仰望已久的邱軍長，這位將軍，這位國際問的名將，胸膛上不但沒有滿掛勲章，而且和大兵一樣的誠樸可親，對於我們的熱情，他是萬分的感激，他像鄉下人遇到嘉賓那樣熱誠的款待我們，顯然的他是很手忙脚亂的，滿屋里都是濃烟，幾塊磚頭砌成一個火爐，幾片劈柴在燃燒着，沒有坐位，沒有桌子，他抱歉着這地方非常對不起客人，而我們看到這位爲國宣勞的名將，在這嚴寒中過着這樣艱苦的生活，反而更覺得他的可敬可愛。大家以最誠墊的態度，代表着汴垣各界的熱情，向他及全體將士表示了慰勞與惑謝之意，他萬分的感激，讓烟，讓茶，忙的不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>他在感　中向大家報吿這一次由豫東西進途中大捷的經過：他說「本軍這次本來是遵照最高當局的命令要走沈邱項城新蔡一帶去完成另一任務的，可是奉令之後，即偵知陳毅匪部有進犯汴鄭企圖，乃一面電報上峯陳述新情况，一面即斷然行動，直接由永城經亳縣鹿邑柘城西進，蓋因汴鄭兩地爲中原政治軍事重心，萬不能失，且共鼴對本軍一向避戰，此次西進不但可解汴鄭之圍，且可找到其卞力打一個痛快仗，恰好陳毅發覺了我們正兼程西進，乃派其最精銳的第入第六和第一等縱隊來更番阻止，當本軍一部進行至前縣南之白廟，河堤岑一帶時，和他們的第六縱隊接觸了，經兩日夜的激戰，第六縱隊被整個擊潰，僅少數殘餘向東南逃竄，第六縱隊慘敗後，第八縱隊上來了，這更是一塲空前慘烈的戰爭，結果這個第八縱隊也在同一地區和第六縱隊遭了同樣命運，殘餘向民權以北逃竄，最後他們連不堪一擊的十一縱隊也拿了上來，只一夜功夫，他們就完全垮了，總計他們這次死傷了兩萬多人，他們的第十八師師長也被擊斃了，被俘了兩千多，武器和馬匹近在清查中，我們也死傷了五百多人，連長和戰車排長也有死傷，但算總賬，我們是太便宜了。日前最高常局已來了命令，認爲我們這次變更計劃，已迅速解汴鄭之圍，處置甚當，現在附近幾十里內已無匪踪，我們是昨天進駐到這里的，汴鄭間之匪雖因感受脅威而他竄，但我們仍不能放鬆他，只要無孔可入，我們一定把這羣老鼠一齊打死。」邱將軍眉飛色舞，氣勢雄壯的報吿完了這次戰役之後，天色已晚了，主人雖有留客之意，而客人確知主人有難言之隱，大家站起來吿辭，我實在有點依依之感，邱將軍見到這種情形，一則還想再和我談談，再則也許覺得留一個客人睡覺或許不成問題，所以堅留我住一宿，同行的四個人也希望我住一夜，把大家未盡的意思多談一談，把他們可歌可泣的戰蹟多搜集一點，我也樂得這樣，於是在暮色蒼茫中他們又被戰車保護着，一溜烟的走了。（記者王廋梅）</p>

<h3>西方夜谭　甘肃和政縣發现新桃源</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州廿四日航訊〕甘肅和政縣，發現世外桃源。緣該縣城關鎭境內，原有「舊租」，係自遜淸時封韓土司所轄。自政府改土歸流，該地即屬靑海省管轄，（因遜淸時韓土司歸靑海循化管轄，故改土歸流後亦應屬靑海省）後因靑海省政府爲劃整地界，同甘肅省政府以臨夏之西鄉對調，臨夏西鄉即歸靑海省管轄，而和政「舊租」，甘省當局並未加以管理。抗勝迄今，全國各地納糧當兵，獨該地人民，從不盡絲毫國民義務，儼然世外桃源。</p>

<p>道士李星悟，三十七歲，甘肅武威人，在蘭市以揣骨論相爲業，上年十二月間，有本市民程萬鍾之妻柴君玉，前往李老道處揣骨，柴固水性楊花，李亦風流老手，一拍即合，乃於上年十二月七日，在左公西路廿四號幽會，適被警局派出所拿獲，將追帽，腰帶，褲子等沒收，李老道則具結開釋。程獲悉此情後，即與柴君王離異，李老道竟金屋藏嬌，樂而忘返。事爲西北日報記者探得，當予記載，李以此項消息乃柴之前夫程萬鍾供給，顯欲破壞彼之名譽，遂自訴於臯闌地方法院，地院於本月十九日公開審理，旁聽者水洩不通，此案定廿三日宜判。</p>
<p>甘肅民樂縣，今冬氣候酷寒，爲全省各地之冠。然自本年元旦後，氣候突然轉暖，大有春日景象。縣府附近向陽之處，草色靑靑，約有寸許，深冬發現綠草，誠屬奇事，爲數十年來所僅見。（記者宋麟）</p>

<p>首先，他吿訴本報記者：「當然，法國人最關心成渝鐵路，因爲一切建設投資，完全建築在交通方便　先　條件下。　是，成渝鐵路的遲遲不簽約，並不能影鄉其他方面的進行。</p>
<p>據本報記者獲悉：法經濟學對自　井的鹽業，極表關懷，賈善納曾赴自法井　察數次，與四川　業公司簽訂了之步合同。去年二月，法國政府　意聘請了清爾蒂尼敎授（Prof.Porlni）來川調查。瀟爾蒂尼是法國有名的地質。石油專家，五丫多歲，現在瑞士洛桑大學任敎，聞報吿書迄在整理中。</p>
<p>當記者問他：「賈善納先生，你既然是川·康·兩省的工程顧問，能否吿聞　對鄧·劉兩主席的建議？」</p>
<p>他非常坦白的回答：距離灌縣上行六十公里遠。興萬坪，據渠考察數月經過，適宜建築一十萬馬力的發電廠。渠已著有厚達三寸的報吿書，送皇鄧錫侯參閱。聞川省府正在趕譯，一俟譯妥，即將寄送資源委員會洽商。</p>
<p>賈善　足跡遍踏川·康兩省，他又是位旅行家。他唯一感覺安　的便是：他向劉文輝主席建議　康定河電力廠，現在已經稍有頭緒了。</p>
<p>康定河共長二十五公里，水流自高岩冲至水底，計有一千公尺，確是建築發電廠最理想的地方。劉文煇已經接受了賈善納　全　意見：沿康定河建造三廠，每廠五萬馬力，相隔三百公尺距離。據談：劉已派省府秘書長赴京請示，洽商不成，劉決私人　資辦理。</p>
<p>遠東經濟代表團團長穆氏由菲返滬後，日前赴京曾與經濟部部長陳啓天商談，內容秘而不宜。本報記者於賈善納的閑話中得到一點綫索。賈善　說：中·法兩國政府均未存有大量美鈔，與其以美鈔　計算中·法　國的一國外料款」，不如直接以貨易貨，來得方便。設若此次穆·陳商談圓滿，成渝鐵路的簽約，又有一綫希望了。（特派員歐陽醇）</p>
<h3>寗夏隴東近貌</h3>
<p>〔本報闌州十三日航訊〕甘寗靑監察使鄧春膏先生，在最近半年來，先後到靑海·河西·寗夏·隴東一帶視察，風塵僕僕，席不睱煖，回蘭州後，和記者會面，在很短促的時間裏，記者請他發表一點視察寗夏·隴東的觀感。</p>
<p>他先從寗夏的省政談起，認爲寗夏的省政確有相當的進步，譬如戶政，是最難辦好的，但在寗夏，戶口的調查，登記和異動，再配合上完善的警政，所以地方治安很是寗靜，沒有「身份證」的人，可以說是寸步難行，共匪更無隙可以活動了。寗夏的雖然比不上甘·青兩省，但也一天天走上理想的境地。一般人民的知識水準也逐漸的提高，各縣都已設立縣中心小學，阿拉善旗定遠營的蒙古兒童，都受着强迫的敎育。眞的，這些蒙古同胞除了虔誠的祟拜宗敎，把孩子送入寺院做喇嘛之外，很少願意送子弟去讀漢文書的，非强迫不可，達王（即達理札雅）對敎育的普及是盡過很大的努力的。</p>
<p>寗夏的水渠縱橫，水利工程在西北各省中，不亞於陝西。年來收成很好，可以達到「足食」的理想，只有兩縣因水旱關係歉收，當局也早把服濟的事辦好了。寗夏已普遍的植樹，其成績也是一日千里。關於隴東的綏靖區，他說月前已是</p>
<p>平靖無事　只有環縣還有少數的共匪潛伏着，國軍八十二師駐紥在這一帶，軍力充實，紀律嚴明，坐鎭西峯鎭的馬　援師長，除了軍事上的戒備外，還注意協助地方的敎育·建設·和撫輯流亡，所以受到地方人民的熱烈擁戴。寗夏銀川市的後方醫院，平凉西峯鎭的後方醫院都比較完善，近來因戰况順利，各院　傷兵都不多。關於隴東綏靖區的</p>
<p>救濟工作　除中央撥給慶陽·合水等六縣急賑款三億元外，甘省府也自籌了一億多，另外黄糜（　糧）八十餘石，辦理急賑。最近舉辦的各縣工賑，是利用難民中有工作能力者，以工賑方式修整慶（陽）環（縣），慶（陽），合（水）等公路，以期軍運便利，而無形的减輕民衆負担。甘省府擬訂的隴東綏靖區復興計劃，如能按步就班的推進，地方的希望很大。</p>
<p>鄧氏談完了這兩個地方的情况之後，綜合的說出他近半年的</p>
<p>出巡感想　來了。他認為目前我國的吏治還未達到完全澄清的階段，監察使的任務還相當重要，監察的使命除了消極的撲滅貪汚，舞弊以外，更應努力，於提高公務人員的服務精神和道德，以求行政效率的增加。</p>
<p>鄧監察使是青海循化人，</p>
<p>服務鄉梓　是他的抱負。中等身材，肌肉堅實，不苟言笑，望之令人生畏。他過去曾一度掌西北最高星府——甘肅學院的校務，桃李滿佈西北。他常常對人說：「肅淸貪汚，使地方人的血汗少被吸收，而用之於大西北的建設，是我平生的願望」。（記者炳林）</p>

<h3>遊台觀感　各級學校設備　都夠得上水準</h3>
<p>近幾月來，報紙上關於合灣的文字，如新聞報導，旅行參觀等等，屢有所見；因爲大家對於這光復後重入祖國懷抱的寳島，都寄予着熟烈　情懷和遠大的期望。台灣疆城畢竟是神州的領土，人民還是炎黃的子孫，可是過去受制於日寇，達半世紀之久，一切都與祖國脫節。光復後要使他完全恢復到祖國化，也就等於經過一次大革命，最主要的而第一步所應該做的，就是敎育制度的澈底改革，這在現在台省最高行政當局，已是苦心孤詣地施其全力於此了。而外省人之入台地參觀者，多半也着意在敎育。所以上海敎育界人士組織的「合灣敎育參觀團」，一而再，再而三，大有接踵而起的　勢，而人數較多，參觀時間較長，所到區域較廣，並且比較的受台地人士熱烈歡迎及盛情招待的，要算首次的上海市敎育局國敎處長朱君惕所領導的國民學校校長參觀團了！</p>
<p>筆者也是這首次參觀團團員之一。我們去台灣的行程，是去年十二月三日至十八日。到台灣第一個登岸的地方是基隆；一路南下到台北·台中·台南；從合南再向南行，是高雄·屏東·以至最南端的鵝鑾鼻燈塔，面對太平洋。台灣的行政區域，分九個市和八個縣：就是基隆市·台北市·新竹市·台中市·嘉義市·彰化市·合南市·高雄市·屏東市，以及合北縣·新竹縣·台中縣·台南縣·高雄縣·台東縣·花述縣·澎湖縣。市以台北和高雄爲最大，其他的市，在行政方面都小於縣。</p>
<p>我們沿途參觀，不稍憇息，日期雖不過短，而所經旅途太長，所以像行軍一般的緊張。綜計先後參觀了台省的三個最高學府——台灣大學·台北工學院·和台南工學院·以及各市縣的中學·師範·國民學校·幼稚園等。參觀國民學校，是我們的本行，所以我們參觀的數量也最多。各級學校的設備，都够得上水準。但是這都是日人的遺產，　產雖則受之無愧，可是日人統制時代的風氣，優良的應該保存，諸如悖乎情理的却已漸漸淘汰了。</p>
<p>除參觀以外，我們還遊覽了好幾　名勝。關於名勝的各個　點，過去早已有人在報上發表渦，茲不　述。現在我所能知道的，關於台省的人事問題，或者比較能引起讀者一點興趣，特略述一下：台灣前在日人統治時代，有一部份台灣人僥倖進入內地，未受日人壓迫，他們諱言自已的省籍，而多以閩人自居，本來台灣在鄭成功死後歸入淸朝版　的時候，會隸入福建行省，福建與台灣是一衣帶水而語音相仿，所以台人和閩人可說是一家的了。台省光復後，設置行政長官公署，下設各處，以辦理全有行政，至「二二八」事變以後，白崇禧將軍親到台灣靖亂，纔把台灣改爲行省，並應台人之要求，各廳處長人選儘先任用台灣人，因此向在內地政學各界稍貝資歷與地位的台灣籍人，平時本以閩人自居者，都恢復了原來省籍，而得榮歸故里，服務桑梓。</p>

<h3>霍主委首次招待記者　說明輸管努力途經　合理分配簡捷手續並提高工作效率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會主委霍寳樹，昨日午後三時半　中國銀行舉行就任後之首次記者招待會，出席　外記　在三十人以上。霍主委即席致辭，說明我國由於經濟能力及經濟環境關係，對進出口貿易之管理，採取量入爲出之原則，即輸入不能超過輸出。復員之初期，因朝野過於樂觀，對進出口之管理不免懈怠，致吃虧甚大，如無意外之外來阻力，恐亦需如今日之吃苦五年，方能恢復平衡。英國於一九四二年大戰勝敗未決之際，即着手研究戰後貿易管理方案，並爲爲戰時之管制辦法，戰後需保留一部份，今日實施管理，果收效甚宏，其卓識與力行，値得我人之欽佩與效法。霍氏並指出今日進口全盤決定於外匯，在朱獲開源辦法之前，只能學「沙漠　喝水」之方式，不方　在所難免。至於進口外匯之分配，將取決於需求之重要性。例如生產所必需之原料，當然比奢侈品優先。公用事業動力專業，因其能影響其他工業，故其優先在其他工業之上。煤碳與金屬礦之問，前者亦居優先。管理會將來擬對此作一整個之研究，希望各業內部亦作類似之研究。至於輸出，今日出口商常以成本不够運費太高爲苦，此事牽涉幣制匯率，不僅爲貿易上之問題，本會將配合各方面盡力協助，使本國商品能銷至海外市塲。在華之外商，因我國管理貿易，不便在所難免，希望能發揮合作精神，共渡此苦難時期，一切問題可公開商討，相互諒解。最後霍主委並說明今後輸管會努力之途徑，要點爲：　擬定各種優先程序，使分配合理。　規定各項原則，使申請之能否接受，片言即可決定，不致因各部門相互推諉而曠日持久。爲此將設立一諮詢組，以便利申請之商人。　將以執行機構之地位，以實際資料提供政府並作切實之建議，使政府決定管理進出口政策時，能顧到事實而不致流於太理想。　過去訂立之章則太多，商人莫知所從，將加以簡單化。　提高輸管會之工你效率，使成爲一服務之機構。</p>
<p>霍氏報吿畢，記者即提出問題多起，當時均未作具體答覆，僅透露第五期限額現正在編製之中；火油之一再漲價，實由於外匯關稅之提高及一般物價之上揚。</p>
<h3>收購廠商一部份成品　國行即日接受申請</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕花紗布管委會棉紗登記辦法公吿施行後，聞紗廠方面，認爲此項登記，無異將棉紗凍結，舊曆年關，各廠資金週轉，不免感覺困難。</p>
<p>茲據該會負責人稱：棉紗登記，實爲管理棉紗初步重要措施，可以防杜棉紗國積走私及投機買賣，紗廠所產棉紗，無證不能出廠，複製業配得棉紗，不能再行轉售牟利，布商染廠配得白坯布後，亦不能以之回籠套紗，惟棉紗領證登記後，即可憑證運銷，過去其他運銷限制，如南運限制等，幷已撤銷，不特並不凍結，而正當廠商祇有較前更加便利，外間所云，實屬誤會。</p>
<p>又棉紗登記證之作用，正如市民之應有身份證，如謂對市民發給身份證，即係將市民凍結，自屬可笑。過去對於棉紗如何方爲囤積，頗費解釋，以是檢查處理均感困難。今後則可得一明確之界說，凡無證之棉紗，或登記證過期之棉紗，均爲囤積，一經查獲，即可處理。正當廠商，所存棉紗，反可因此獲得合法之保障云。</p>

<h3>漫談風濕症及其療法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>關於風濕症之發生及其經過情形，實在非常複業，亦非本文所能盡述。本文所談者乃在風濕症對於人生影響之重大及其最近之療治方法而已。</p>
<p>近年以來，世界各國之醫學家對於爲害人體之各種病症均已殫心竭處研究其發生原因及其治療方法，例於對於結核症，癌症，麻瘋症，腦脊髓灰白質炎等症早已募集鉅金成立各種研究院，延聘專門人材加以研究。惟獨對於風濕症方面，則似乎爲人遺忘，不加注意。其實風濕一症，爲害於人至大，豈可忽視。吾人根據支加哥大學第三病院A.E.Luckhardt氏報吿，知在六百萬年前之爬蟲類骨骼中已有慢性風濕關節炎之痕跡。此在支加哥古物陳列所內已有充份之證明物可供考證。又在生活於二百萬年前之人猿骨骼內亦有患慢性風濕關節炎之遺跡。而五十萬年以前之爪哇人北京人以及八千年以前之埃及金字塔所藏木乃伊骨骼內亦有慢性風濕關節炎遺跡。可見風濕症深襲性之强大也。其實，吾人若將殘廢病人加以統計，則其中之風濕症患者亦非少數。據上述陸卡德氏之估計，美國之患風濕病者共有一千萬人。此一千萬人之數額實超過於全國患結核症，癌症，糖尿病以及心臟病等之合併總數。此一千萬風濕症患者巾有七百萬人患關節風濕症，，而其中則有十五萬人完全殘廢不能工作，又其中之一百萬人則於一年中有五個月不能工作。可見風濕症侵襲範圍之廣及其影嚮於人生者之大。我國之新醫事業尙未發達，醫政當局目前又無暇顧及，誠憾事也。</p>
<p>關於風濕症之治療方法當然以有正確之診斷爲前提。而風濕症之正確診斷則往往不易獲得，蓋其類似之病症甚多，倘或稍爲忽視，則靡有不被誤診者。例如尿酸關節炎，甲狀腺分泌過多症，外傷後之關節滑液膜炎，腱膜炎，關節　維素炎，關節粘液囊炎，關節轉捩關簡脫臼等症，倘或不爲詳細查驗則極易誤診爲慢性風濕關節炎症。又如白濁性之關節炎，結核性關節炎梅毒性關節炎以及肺炎球菌性關節炎等亦極易誤診爲風濕性關節炎症。此外如骨膜炎性關節炎，癌性病症，神經炎性病症，脊髓癆症以及發炎性脊髓空洞症，希斯脫里症血友病性關節炎症等均有類似症象，必須詳細區別診斷以及有錯誤發生。吾人醫師以及病家倘或遇有骨節酸痛肌肉峻療等情，即不假思索，認爲患有風濕症而服以風濕藥物，結果當然不會痊愈，遂致疑惑藥物不靈。其實　不對症與　物何尤。</p>
<p>關於治療方而之種種理論問題（例如患有風濕症之婦人可以在妊娠期中忽然痊愈。又如患有風濕症之病症可以因兼患黃疸症而忽然痊愈等等）因篇幅關係暫且從略。吾人目前所知之風濕症治療方法甚多，如水浴療法，電氣療法，理學療法，以及藥物療法等等。在藥物療法中以前盛行使用水楊酸製劑，阿米諾酸劑，金質製劑，維他命製劑，內分泌製劑以及蛋白質製劑等等。惟皆不能令人滿意。近年來美國曾經大量使用金質製劑及維他命製劑惟試驗之後結果並不佳良。又如蜂毒療法亦早已爲人所倡用，但共功效亦不見佳良。近據陸卡德氏報吿，彼自十八年以來即已使用前維也納國立血淸試驗所所長Dr.Gu　tav　Paul氏，於一九廿七年所倡用之Cutivaccih　Paul法。此法甚佳，功效可靠。陸氏本人亦曾患風濕關節炎症，用盡方法而久治不愈。後得支加哥大學細菌學敎授Prof.Dr.E.Pribram氏勸告，試用上述方法，一試之後馬上見效。今據十八年來之經臉已可證明此法爲絕對可靠矣。此種皮肉注射之鮑氏漿苗係自一種細菌名Saprophyten（腐化菌）所提鍊出之漿苗，加人相常份量之結核菌蛋白質新陳代謝物（Tubermucin）再加以一比千份之濾過性消毒天花病菌漿苗，並滲以少量之老杜勃苦林（即舊時所倡之結核菌漿苗)四種漿苗所合成。對於慢性關節風濕，慢性肌肉風濕，坐骨神經痛，以及其他神經痛筋骨痛等均有奇效。用特爲文誌之，以資介紹云。</p>
<h3>淋病</h3>
<p>— 花新人譯</p>
<p>病，很多人都曾感染過。牠是一種歡喜病，也是一碰一拍即得的毛病（Clap.　Gleet）。牠是由一種很細小的雙球菌，呌做淋病雙球菌，所致的高度傳染病。淋病是由不潔的性交時所染上的；牠像傷風那樣的普遍流行。淋病與梅毒是兩種不同的毛病；可是牠能在同一地方傳染給同一個人。淋病，不能轉成梅毒，而梅毒也同樣的不易變成淋病。　次感染全愈後，可以再度的感染。</p>
<p>淋病對於男子</p>
<p>在不潔的性交後，淋病菌侵入生殖器部的尿管，在尿管的內壁附着繁殖，再至性器官，習見的，淋菌還可以通過到我們的血管，然後，再由血循環帶至身體其他部位，牠可以侵入心臟，關節，形成風濕病，關節炎。</p>
<p>淋病的第一個症狀Sign是小便時感刺痛灼熱。在尿管內的病理變化多半是發紅，刺激。像這樣的症狀　現，多在性交後一至三天，膿液排泄物　着由陰痙口部流出，細小成片的膿阻塞着尿道。初期的膿液是白色，以後，却變成了很厚帶黃色的膿液。在每一滴膿中，藏有千餘的細菌，很容易接觸傳染。如果有一小滴膿液侵入眼部，很容易成爲瞎子。在腹股溝，鼠蹊部的淋巴腺，開始腫疼，這時，患者體溫隨而增高。醫師應用玻片塗抹標本在顯微鏡下很容易找着淋菌，這就是很科學的診斷。在這時，若果有適宜的治療，淋病可能停止深入。反之，若果不予治療，這時淋菌就會長驅直入的侵至前列腺及睪丸，萬一睪丸發炎，淋病治療就較困難。這種情形，重以構成你不生育及絕後　後果。</p>
<p>淋病對於女性</p>
<p>第一個症狀，淋病染及婦女們，同樣的也是小便時刺痛，在尿管及陰道部都發紅腫。繼後，多量的白黃色膿液排溢出來。祇要是陰道有液溢流出，不管是白色或黃色，都暗示了你染到了淋病，應當立刻去看醫師；因爲，淋菌有可能性經陰道跑入子宮內。當牠侵至輸卵管及卵巢時，淋病即可一直遷延到與她生命相終始。淋病，就是最好的理由，證明你一生爲什麼不會有孩子。</p>
<p>怎樣處理淋病</p>
<p>當你發現了有淋病現象時，趕速去請敎醫師，遵守並信任醫師的指導。要記　，早期的治療，　　　　　治療是危險的事。</p>
<p>不要去請敎江湖朗　，　店的老板。尤其是不要自作主張服成藥。這樣，對你的經濟及健康，都有損害。因爲淋病是很難治療的病，也只有正式的科學醫師，明瞭治療的方法，所以你要信任他們。</p>
<p>避免性慾的激動，戒忌性交，尤其是在治療時要絕對停止·否則，對你不利，也易傳染他人。</p>
<p>禁忌飲酒：因爲任何酒類，均能增加分泌排溢，同時，使發炎加劇。最好飲大量的水。</p>
<p>柔軟體操可以舉行，大便要通暢。</p>
<p>不要換藥包紥，蓋住陰莖或陰道。因爲這樣，膿就不易排出，發炎日漸加劇。</p>
<p>接觸陰部後，必須用肥皂與水洗手，以免使淋菌散佈他人，包括自己的孩子，有時，淋菌可由手傳及眼睛，故此，一切毛巾，杯碗，及其他個人用物，均須消毒，冲洗。灌腸用具，絕對禁再用他人，否則，受染的機會更多。</p>
<p>若睪丸腫大，一切的治療必須暫停，安靜的睡在床上，用冰袋或熟水袋敷於腫處。</p>
<p>消毒藥水冲洗，對於女性淋病較有效，不過，必須要經醫師的指導。</p>
<p>病有全愈的希望，尤其是用盤尼西林及磺胺類化　類Sulfadizine。可是，這種藥的價値雖高，但危險性亦大。若服用不得法，也會失去療效。所以你不必自己去服用，必定要接受正式醫師的指導，祇有他們明悉淋病的變化。</p>
<p>全愈的現象</p>
<p>不要以爲沒有膿液流出，就認為淋病痊愈了。在延誤治療時間，及治療不合法時，膿液也會停止排出。不過要考慮的問題就是，淋菌是否已深入身體內部？若果淋菌轉移了陣線，那發炎是不曾停止的。醫師們可以有很多的方式去試驗，可以證實是否完全的痊愈。醫師們可用下列方法去檢驗你：A檢驗小便，B微鏡尋找是否有淋菌發現，C按　前列腺，可以確定現在是否有膿液，D細心的檢驗陰道。</p>
<p>經過上述的檢查手續程序，若果證明沒有淋菌發現，那，我們可以說是好了。也可以保蹬是痊愈了。但，爲了預防起見，患者爲了保全自己的配偶計，在痊愈後數月中，仍應該停止性交。（譯自美國共公衛生服務處刊印　小册子名Gororrttea　the　crippler)</p>
<h3>肺結核病的防禦（三）</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>肺結　病率與　所之關係人口密度若大，感染肺結核病愈容易。如城市學校則易感染肺結核病。英國愛下堡一九一〇—一九一二年曾就結核病死亡率與住所關係統計：</p>
<p>可見住屋面積愈大，光綫，空氣，溫度等條件均佳良，罹病因素方可减少。故Rnbunt主張每人應有二十立方公尺之空氣。關於採光，通氣不良的房屋，則甚易罹病。</p>
<p>肺結核罹病率　戰爭的關係　在對外作戰時，生活動盪，物價高漲，營養不良。兼之精神上遭受嚴　打擊，故在戰爭期末，結核罹病率自趨增加。德國在第一次世界大戰前，肺結核死亡率是百分之一·三六，常戰爭時是百分之二·三。可知戰爭能使肺結核病患者激增。</p>
<p>三糖尿病：糖尿病已被認爲增進肺結核流行的因素。羅體（Root）一一二一糖尿病屍體解剖的報告中，有如期望的二，三例發現。在麻省高級中學發現十五到二十歲的靑年有糖尿病發生，而肺核結則在十六歲時發展。事實上，結核病的　犯，跟隨着糖尿病的發生。</p>
<p>四姙娠：普通認爲姙娠使對結核病抗力降低，僅注意母體流產的保護。新近較多的研究，說明產後的護理，同家庭照顧，對於潛伏性結核尤應切實注意爲宜。實際上孕婦對孕期護理是滿意，而妨害姙娠較少，但對產後護理，即多感有危險。因爲不能意想到　後對結核病抗力降低，結核在此時間最易發展，為害亦至大。</p>
<p>五免疫性：人類無先天免疫性，每人均可感患結核病。在我國幾乎每人均生過結核病。小孩子感受結核桿菌者，有百分之九十發生粟粒性結核死亡。亦有發生局部（肺淋巴）結核者。在局部方面有由身體抗力减弱而死亡者，亦有由抗力增强而將結核病灶包圍。若其病灶中依然有生活的結核桿菌，其包圍結果有二種：一爲抗力降低，營養不良，則可再發。一爲抗力增强，終至石灰化。此可謂結核全愈。若在幼兒時期，未感受結核病，則至成人時，亦易感染。此則多爲全身性粟粒結核。由此可知免疫性，要有生活的結核桿菌在體內，方可發生免疫性，即在生活的結核桿菌被包圍時，身體才有特殊抵抗力。因此有傳染方有免疫力。故結核病為傳染性免疫。經傳染免疫後，對結核桿菌之侵襲，始有相當抵抗力。但吾人對於結核病之免疫學原理，所知極少，所明暸者，即豐富營養，充分休息，新鮮空氣，以及其他優良之衛生環境，足以增進吾人抵抗力，以預防傳染耳。</p>
<p>結核菌侵襲人體的來源，以結核病病人身上排出的人型結核桿菌爲最多。亦有牛型結核桿菌爲病在體者。其肺結核傳染病方式與途徑，可分列如後：</p>
<p>食品傳染：此多經消化道傳染，多見於小兒。常由於曾飲含有結核桿菌之牛乳而傳染，或人乳及人工乳而感染。又與患者共用飲食品具，能將結核桿菌帶入腸內。根據實驗證明，結核桿菌能穿過健康動物之腸膜以入於淋巴及血液，逕達肺部。因肺中毛細血管之過滬作用，而附於肺泡。更因肺部感受性特高，乃產生肺結核。他如淋巴結核，及腸結核等，亦多由此而發現。</p>
<p>接觸傳染：肺結核病人的痰液，膿液等，可以使健康者發生結核病。如小孩在地上玩，遇有結核菌痰液，則極易傳染。故兒童匍伏在地，實屬不妥。普通生活習慣，如同睡一室，接吻等，如其中之一爲肺結核病人，則其他諸人極易感患肺結核病。其他如肺結核病人所遺留的大便，尿，膿等排泄物，汚染器械，飲水，食品等物，亦可以發生傳染。致患腸結核，泌尿生殖系結核，及皮膚結核等。（未完）</p>
<h3>保溫禦寒的衛生談</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>這兩天，西伯利亞的寒流，到上海光臨了一下，把上海的市面，變成滴水成冰，朔風砭骨的局勢。各人碰頭時，不是開口：「哪能格冷」！就是說：「這兩日，實在冷得吃勿消」！</p>
<p>於是乎，「保溫禦寒」便無形中成了我們每位市民的重要工作了。</p>
<p>現在，就順便來談談這「保溫禦寒」的衛生方法吧。</p>
<p>保溫禦寒這一件事，是多方面的：利用電爐，火爐，水汀，（最近還有美貨的電氣水汀應市）以增高室內環境的溫度，這是消極方面的一種；多穿着點衣服，這也是消極方面的一種；多進一些生暖的食物，——如脂肪一類的食物，這是積極方面的一種；從事全力運動，如跑路，拍球，在室內，則可作各種的徒手運動，這亦是能使身體生溫的一種積極的禦寒方法，其次，洗澡一事，也是一種生暖禦寒的衛生工作哩。</p>
<p>電爐，火爐，水汀，以及電氣水汀，的確是消極的禦寒法子，但，這是要有經濟條件，不合大衆的口胃；四百餘萬的上海市民中，我想，大多數人，是沒有這個經濟條件的。也便沒有享受這個優越的禦寒設備的份兒。煤球爐——不裝烟囱的煤球爐，在經濟條件的一點說，好像是比較的合乎一般大衆的口胃了，但在衛生條件上說，却是一種最違反衛生原則的取暖辦法。每屆冬令，總有成批的煤氣中毒的病人死人，載在報端，和讀者們相見的。所以，這種不裝烟囱的煤球爐，是種最違反衛生，有危及生命的保溫工具，絕對採用不得。</p>
<p>不過，最近因煤球飛漲，價格高得驚人，就連不裝烟肉的煤球爐，一般的平民，也因經濟關係，無力應用了。</p>
<p>如其經濟不成問題，那末，電爐也好，火爐也好，水汀更好，悉聽尊便。不過，要請閣下注意的是：進房脫衣，出房穿衣，務使保持體溫平均；否則，傷風咳嗽，又作成了醫生藥房的生意經。</p>
<p>穿着衣服，除了沒有經濟能力，無法穿着得暖和的貧民苦兒，與有了經濟能力而不願穿着暖和的「摩登小姐」之外，普通人，誰都曉得，天氣一冷，多穿點衣服，即能達保暖禦寒的目的的。應加注意的，也有一點：亦不要穿過了度，以致阻礙人體的行動；因爲動能生暖，其禦寒之效，正不在衣能保溫之下哩。</p>
<p>多進脂肪，能够生暖的理由，亦甚簡單；大塊頭的胖子，比較的不怕冷，爲什麼？就是因爲他的體肉，比人家多了幾多磅的脂肪呀。但這也有經濟性的條件的；如其連三四等的糙秈米，還裝不飽一個空肚子的窮朋友，當然還談得上今朝吃油，明天嚼肉嗎？不過一部份有口福的朋友，樂得可以多進一些這類富於脂肪的食品。同時，也得注意：亦不宜勉强多進，否則，吃壞肚子，弄成消化不良，鄙人聲明在前，概不負責！</p>
<p>運動之有益於人體健康，是誰都曉得的。在冬季行之，不但能鍛鍊身體，裨益健康，更能使體肉生溫增暖，眞是一椿最富於積極性的禦寒良法。無暇拍球，無機會踢球，跑跑馬路，總是有機會的。這，不但比出入摩托卡，往還三輪車，來得經濟，而且也更合乎衛生，更加裨益體康。</p>
<p>勞工階級，往往就利用着他們的終日勞動，來補償了他們的單衣粗食的保溫禦寒的缺點。</p>
<p>洗澡，除了淸潔皮膚的功用之外，更要有促進體膚的新陳代謝的功能。即因其有促進體膚的新陳代謝的功能之故，也就有增溫禦寒的作用了。</p>

<h3>一個奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>據組約時報最近消息，二十年來始終居於蘇聯經濟學權威地位的代爾加氏，最近已被蘇聯當局　棄了。伐氏是蘇聯科學院世界政治經濟講座系的主任。但現在不僅伐氏本人被解去職務，他所主持的世界政治經濟學系亦遭廢止了，並且另外有二十餘名一起和他工作的經濟學者，亦一起被當局所開除。</p>
<p>蘇聯政治上曾有過好幾次的大淸然事件，像淸算托洛斯基派，以及後來淸算拉狄克，蒲哈林諸人。不過歷次的大淸黨都是起因政治問題，但這次的淸算伐爾加却並無直接政治問題關係，而是爲了伐氏堅持其經濟理論。</p>
<p>據紐約時報的報告，不久前伐爾加出版了一册經濟著作（書名不詳），根據他對世界經濟現狀硏究所得的結論，伐氏認爲西方資本主義各國在戰後十年間不致發生經濟恐慌，資本主義國家的工人生活戰時會見改善，許多殖民地方式的經濟掠奪現在亦廢棄了，他更指出戰爭並沒有增加了資本主義國家的財富。</p>
<p>伐氏更進而承認他的客觀的經濟分析，使他不得不到達與蘇聯黨方立論恰好相反的結論。因爲蘇聯黨方對戰後世界的經濟估計，是認爲資本主義各國戰後必然發生經濟大恐慌，各國的工人生活必將惡化，因此將造成「有利」於革節的「客觀形勢」。而現在這位無產階級的經濟權成，竟全部推翻了這種「估計」！</p>
<p>我沒有硏究過經濟學，伐爾加的著作亦從未有機曾拜讀過，從而對於伐氏個人絕無愛憎的觀念。他過去與現在的理論孰爲正　，更無從判斷。不過像伐氏這樣一個有二十年歷史聲譽的經濟學者，他這一次下的經濟分析，想來　不致於全無根據；而他現在還身居莫斯科，所以也不致於公開叛變其祖國。</p>
<p>然而伐氏現在終於「失寵」了，但却並不是出於他個人的任何過失，而是爲了他忠於他的學問，忠於他作爲一個經濟學者的身份——即忠於他的追求的學術眞理。</p>
<p>據說在蘇聯當局發現伐氏理論的「錯誤」之後，即組織了一個法庭審判他，要他承認他的錯誤。但伐氏僅答說他可以略略修改他的理論，甚至願意提供任何的政治解釋，惟對於根據事實所下的結論，他拒絕變更。</p>
<p>這是多麼表現了一個學者的殉道精神！更難能可貴的是，伐爾加並不是一個生長在民主自由國家空氣中的公民，他也許是蘇聯的一個黨員，也許曾獲得過紅星或列寗獎章，但這一切在他埋首於學術硏究之前，都不足成爲他追求傎理的障碍，而且反給了他勇氣。</p>
<p>當然，伐爾加過去與現在的經濟理論，也許都不是傎理，不過他的不肯附和人云亦云的能度，他的勇於觀察事實，證實了他確是一個有價値的學者。我們儘可以反對他的經濟理論，但對於他作爲一個學者的傲骨，是不得不表示佩服的。</p>
<p>當今之世，所謂學術空氣云云，原已衰落到不能再衰落了，一般所謂學者，不是戴了眼鏡說話，便有所謂背景。而沽名釣譽者流，更觸目皆是。更奇怪的是，學者也有甚麼派別，宗派思想往往替代了眞理。因此，意氣用事亦每代替了學術與傎理的探討。像伐爾加那　的人可說是少數中的少數，而更有意義的，這樣的事件竟出在「鐵幕」後面的國家中，這不能不說是一個令人注意的奇蹟。</p>
<h3>台灣行</h3>
<p>— 唐乃炘</p>
<p>曩　黃公度所著「人境廬詩草」中有「台灣行」，當我初讀這詩的時間，距今已約二十五載，童年吟詩，不求　解，僅覺共琅琅上口可誦而已。迨抗　興，避難入蜀，在四川女中擔任國文，曾經敎着「台灣行」，現在隱約記得這篇是在開明活葉文選上的。</p>
<p>最近台遊歸來，憶及該詩，向坊問覓購一人境　詩草」，找遇了大小新老書店，均無是書，　開明　活葉文選，亦已絕版，冷　書館也偕不出，嗣因台灣大學文學院圖書館有友人，乃去函　其覓得抄寄，目的是在這　「台灣行」。近接覆函，謂圖書館中僅有卡片而無原書，蓋在光復時期已遭散失，惟在私人方面藏書中抄來云云，遠道來鴻，彌覺可珍，處今日情况而讀「台灣行」，更覺親切有味，爰錄之以投自由談。</p>
<p>「城頭蓬蓬雷大鼓，蒼天蒼天淚如爾，倭人竟割台灣去。當初版圖入天府，天威遠及日出處，我高我曾我祖父，艾殺蓬蒿來此土，糖霜茗雪千億樹，歲課金錢無萬數，天胡緊我天何怒，取我脂膏供仇　，眈眈無厭彼碩鼠，民則何辜罹此苦，亡秦者誰三戶楚，何况閩粵百萬戶。成敗利鈍非所覩，人人效死誓死拒，萬衆一心誰敢侮。一聲拔劍起擊柱，今日之事無他語，有不從者手刃汝，學堂藍旗立黃虎，傾城擁觀空巷舞，黃金斗大印緊組，直將總統呼巡撫；「今日之政民爲主，台南台北固吾圉，不　雷池越一步！」海城五月風怒號，飛來金翅三百艘，追逐巨艦來如潮，前者上岸雄虎彪，後者奪關飛猿猱，村田之銃備前刀，當輒披靡血杵漂，神焦鬼爛城門燒，誰與戰守誰能逃，一輪紅日當空高。千家白旗隨風飄，撍紳耆老相招邀，夾跪道旁俯折腰，紅纓竹冠盤錦絛，靑絲辮髮埀雲　，跪捧銀盤茶與糕，絲沈之瓜紫蒲桃。「將軍遠來無乃勞，降民敬爲將軍導。」將軍曰「來，呼汝曹，汝我黃種原同胞，延乎郡王人中豪，實開此土來分茅，今日還我天所敎，國家仁聖如唐堯，撫汝育汝殊黎苗，安汝家室母曉曉。」將軍徐行塵不囂，萬馬入城風蕭蕭，嗚呼將軍非天驕，王師威德無不包，我輩生死將軍操，敢不歸依明聖朝，噫　吁悲乎哉，汝全台！昨何忠勇今何怯，萬事反覆隨轉睫，平時戰守無豫備，曰「忠」曰「義」何所恃。」</p>
<h3>助學譚</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>寒假一開始，橫在學生面前最大的問題就是下學期的學費怎麼辦？</p>
<p>讀書是下一代青年們的權利，讓靑年們自己為失學問題而奔走呼籲，實在是這一代中年人們的慚愧和羞恥，學生們在大冷大熱天沿門托鉢，半工半讀，用自己的手溫暖自己，雖道這樣廣大的社會就旁若無　地看他們自生自滅而不予以援助？「靑年是社會的柱石，國家的基礎。」這句話從小學裏記週記時候就知道應川，傎是濫調中之濫調，可是儘管嘴裏喊得吐沫乾，耳朶聽得生老繭，我們的「柱石」和「基礎」却愈來愈脆弱，受不住無情的摧殘，已經走到了毀滅的邊緣！</p>
<p>助學巳經有上好幾年的歷史，然而一年比一年窘困，一學期比一學期糟糕，需要愈迫切廣大，供應反比例地愈稀少艱難。原因很簡單：「自顧不暇，愛莫能助。」八個大字而已。普天之下，莫非貧民，有良心肯帮人忙的全成了窮光蛋，「天下好人一般窮」，零加零加零，加上幾千萬次，結果的答數依然是個圈圈。這個社會倒並不缺少熱心人士，可惜的是熟心人士都除了一顆熱心外，身無長物，幼吾幼以及人之幼，自己兒子留額金還籌不齋，更無論他人子弟的學費了。也許有人會說：「請有錢人慷慨解囊呀！上海不是多的是有錢人麼？」但是這問題可以倒過來看，假使他有慷慨解囊的話，那麼他也不能成爲有錢人了。請穿着二件單衣的人脫下一件單衣捐助易，請重裘裏得像這大肉綜的卸却一條圍巾難，這絕非過甚其辭，而是經臉之談！兩廣水災，冬令救濟，一次次都是幾百億幾百億的鉅數，接下去又是工程浩大的助學，百業凋疲市面不景氣的年關前，上帝才知道有多少把握！</p>
<p>助學之外，和助學有着密切關係的問題是學生們受了這一筆助金後有沒有獲到最大的成果？把錢用到不知所云的地方去是件最不値得的事，如果辛辛苦苦的給凑足了學費，而半年之後，學生得到的除了加深幾度近視眼外，什麼都不切實用，助學豈不成爲一件極大的浪費？誰都知道學費貴到這個地步，並不是敎師們的責任，可是敎師們雖不能枵腹從公，總可以分外努力，多啓發一步學生的智慧，多培養一分學生的能力，使得之匪易的助學金增加幾分效率。聰明如爲人師者，總能够知道這也是助學的另一種方式吧！</p>
<h3>編劇</h3>
<p>— 毅</p>
<p>一個女歌手正在與一位名劇作家合寫一個劇本，消息傳來，兩個與她相識的同行便對這件事情議論起來。</p>

<p>「這不容易嗎？」另一個不屑地回答說，「她大概是寫幕與幕之間的「休息」的」</p>

<h3>第九章　洩漏機密（五七）</h3>
<p>章老太太見他一力推諉，知道　卿所猜的不錯，當時也不便揭破，祇點點頭道：「我們是親戚，什麼事都好商量，雲卿的心緒，你是知道的，你不要害了她。」渚齊含糊答應兩聲，藉詞上班鐘點已到，急忙忙辭了出去。弄得章老太氣忿忿地來告訴雲卿，說要找渚齊的父親說去，把渚幣在外面胡鬧玩戲子的情形，會告訴他老子。雲　忙阻住道：「這個萬使不得，果然如此，會迫得渚齊和綺紈，雙雙逃走到外面去結婚。我另有辦法，母親且不用生氣。」說後急急梳洗完畢，趕到鳳　家裏，見她照常操作，沒有一點頽喪的神氣，間渚齋這幾天來了沒有？鳳笙道：「我也不希望他來，來了也沒用處，見面徒然呌我心煩，我希望他永遠不來。」雲卿萬不料鳳笙曾說出這稱決絕話來，問道：「你的生活費，他按目照付嗎？」鳳笙道：「這個很守約，到期總送，上次我要多用一點錢，寫個字條給他，立刻撥送三千萬過來，我一時又用不完。」雲卿詫異道：「他送三千萬元給你，他一月薪水才有多少，那來許冬錢？」鳳笙道：「這個我才不管，就便是作賊偸來，與我也不相干，我錢花完了，祇問他要。」雲卿把嘴　一咬，遲疑一會這：「事情不是這樣簡單，我今天得了一個消息，特來告訴你，現在又聽說渚齊給你許多錢，益發證明渚齋的行爲了。你猜他這筆款子，由那裏來的？」雲卿說時，一雙含有決斷性的眼光，看在鳳笙臉上。鳳笙臉上毫無表情的應道：「我那知道！隨他由那裏拿來的，都不成問題，和我也都不相干。」雲卿搖搖頭，微微一笑，鄭軍說道：「不能這樣說，你要知道：近來渚齋和唱戲的顯綺紈，打得火熱，有娶她的可能。」雲卿以爲這幾句話，鳳笙聽了，一定很受打繫，不想她仍木木地，祇把眼睛一翻道：「我料他沒有這膽量！他敢娶女戲子進門，不怕他老子生氣！這他自有他老子治他，用不着我操心。」雲卿道：「你不能如此看法，比方他得了他父親同意，那你就吃虧了！」鳳笙道：「絕對不會的，他沒有還膽量。」雲卿道：「他和你離婚，未嘗不是要娶綺紈，你怎麼這樣糊塗！此時你不出來制止，將來木已成舟，你可怎麼辦？你的前途太危險了！」</p>
<h3>宋江平方臘</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜</p>
<p>小說謂方臘為宋江所破，然宋史但載侯蒙欲招安宋江以討方臘，僅有此言，實未嘗有其事也。且宋江降張叔夜後，名字亦不再見於史籍。至方臘被擒，乃韓世忠之功，（見韓　王神道碑及宋史韓世忠列傳）尤於宋江無與，似若小說之言爲無稽矣。然吾閱中興姓氏奸邪錄云：「宣和二年，方臘反睦州，陷溫，台，婺，處，杭，秀等州，東南震動。以童貫爲江浙宜撫使，領劉延慶，劉光世，辛企宗，宋江等軍二十餘萬往討之。……貫至浙，率諾將擒臘，蘇於京師。」此雖未明言宋江有何戰績，然方臘之平，宋江實與其役，固斑斑可考。而特書宋江以與劉延慶劉光世辛企宗等諸將並列，度其時江之位亦不甚卑矣。是小說所述，亦略有依據，不盡出於架空揑造也。惟宋江雖嘗縱橫河朔，而史籍載之，不若方臘之詳，其披猖殆遠出方臘下，顧今人津津樂道宋江梁山泊事，而無以方臘方張之勢掛齒頰者，是則小說宣和遺事及水清傳爲宋江緣飾渲染之力也。</p>
<h3>職業的負擔</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>一天，我上辦公室附近的一家小餐館去進食，看見一個西服簇新的二十來歲的年輕人，他的衣服的剪裁，並不時式，一望而知，出於內地西服店內之手。以後我遇見他好幾次，日子一久，漸漸跟他斯熟了，只知道他在一家經營進出口業的公司內，當一份小差使。</p>
<p>另一天，下着罪罪的小雪，我公畢出來，無目的地走近這家小餐館去小坐，因爲它是兼售牛奶咖啡等飲料，凑巧那一個年輕人也在應。這裏爲行文方便計，就稱他爲K君吧。</p>
<p>我跟他東拉西扯的談了一陣，後來K君談到了他自己的簡單的履歷和職業。原來他的原籍是我國一處偏遠的省分，父親是一個大地主，可是並沒有多少現款。他在當地大學畢業後，因爲不甘於小城市的生活，就由他的家中變賣一部份產業資送他到上海來，找一件職業，同時也可以多學習一些處世的經臉。</p>
<p>他父親在上海的世交很多，有些是有地位的名流，因此，不久他便被安挿在一家進出口公司內，開始他的寫字間生活。</p>
<p>他感到不方便的是：他在上海孑然一身，住在相熟的父執家中，一則因爲路途太遠，二則因爲與父執輩相處，起居生活，不免受到拘束，所以他不得不在寫字間附近，另外找了一處旅館。這樣一來，他每月開支很大。據說他自故鄉到上海來包括旅費及零用在內，已用去約七千萬元，目前他的家中還須按月寄一千五百萬元給他，因爲據他很坦白的告訴，每月的薪水，只有三百萬元，連付旅館的租金都不够。</p>
<p>我替他代爲打算道：「你可不可以去找一處比較便宜的旅館呢？」</p>
<p>他說：「上海的旅館很貴，我初來上海的時候，XX飯店租金每天要二三十萬元，現在總要一百多萬元吧。我住的旅館已經算便宜了。」</p>
<p>我說：「你如果到上海來做一筆大生意，按月有一至二億元的收入，不妨去住XX旅館，可是你的收入只有三百萬元，去住六七萬元的旅館，還須支出晚餐的費用，似乎有些不相稱吧。」</p>
<p>他說：「我多花一些錢，倒不在乎，只希望多得一些經驗。」說時他對我笑了一笑。</p>
<p>我替他想了一想，如果他沒有這份差使，他就無須這筆開支。以前我只知道有「生活的負擔」這一句成語，現在却發現還有「職業的負擔」這一會事，因此我對他說，「假使你志在學習的話，人家工作八小時，你該工作十小時才是。你所下的本錢方才不致虛擲呢。」</p>
<p>的確，在這萬花筒似的大都市生活中，隨着人事的錯綜複雜，環境變化的層出不窮，不停的使你新事新物與保持多方面的接觸，只要你有準確的判斷，充分的吸收，可以像一個乾涸的海綿，吸滿了智識的水分。那末，像K君那樣的例子，一時雖覺得他的工作是一種職業的负擔，終有一天會從他的職業中得到收穫的。</p>
<h3>隆冬話貂裘</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>一入冬季，女性的最時髦的衣着要算皮大衣了，而皮大衣之中又以貂皮爲上品。雖然一襲上好的海豹，水獺或者波斯羊的毛皮所製的大衣比次等的貂裘價格爲高，但是，許多人都認爲後者是一種「高貴」的象徵。</p>
<p>貂是鼬鼠的同族，據說，貂是「各種的鼬鼠之中的量殘忍和最兇暴者，精力充沛，具有不惑疲倦的活動力。」從愛慕虛榮的女子對貂裘的祟拜狂中看起來，令人懷疑這種貂的特性不知是否已經轉移給她們？</p>
<p>柔軟細膩的品質和光彩晶潔的毛頭是優美的貂皮的特色；顏色從淡棕轉變到深棕。野貂剝製而成的大衣量賣得起錢，在美國，一襲上好的貂裘標價昂達七千塊錢。就是馴養的「家貂」也値錢，做成一件大衣亦能賣到兩千五百塊錢以上。</p>
<p>最最時式的是「變化貂」或稱銀藍貂。用這種貂所做的大衣，其價値之高，幾乎令人難以置信。一件普通的皮大衣祇賣到兩百美金左右，可是，一件銀藍貂裘的定價却在一萬三千美金與一萬六千美金之間。</p>
<p>可是，「貂裘狂」者能够到舊貨家裏去發掘她們的崇拜物。那裏，舊的貂皮大衣祇賣四百美金到六百美金，並且外觀亦很新</p>
<p>縫製一襲上乘的貂裘要經過許多的工程。一個優良的皮貨商具有比巧匠更大的才能；他必須也是一個藝術家。最初，將許多張皮放在一起，比較色澤，然後，將整張的皮切成小塊，細心的配合在一起，再按照大衣的樣子舖張和扣在硬紙板上。次一步，把它們用一萬枚左右的釘子釘在牆上，放在那裏兩三天，以便吹乾。一件通常的皮大衣與一件漂亮的皮大衣之間的區別，就在於這種釘與切的技巧。</p>
<p>乾燥之後，便把各部份　合起來，接下來是試樣，加光，熨燙，梳理和細察，總之，務必使它成爲一件絕對完美的皮大衣！也就是一件價格最貴的奢侈品。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統的捉刀人</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>杜魯門總統，以一國元首之尊，日理萬幾，在大半情形之下，自然抽不出從容揮毫的工夫。而今年四十初度的克拉克·克里富特氏，便是杜總統的傳聲筒，打字機，和捉刀人。</p>
<p>克里富特先生，方面大耳，相貌堂堂，頭髮　曲，身材魁梧，乍視之下，頗與英國電影明星羅勃　高茂萊有虎　中郞之似。凡是杜魯門總統署名的文告，發表的演說，泰半出於他的手筆。不久前美國通過的减稅法案，亦由克氏負責起草。</p>
<p>事實上，克里富特忠於職守，辦事認傎。總統手上任何未了事宜，均由他逐一理楚，他不但是總統的親信，又是一位不同尋常的機要秘書，往往業握代拆代行的全權。</p>
<p>按白宮中總統官邸內，每天電話的鈴聲不斷，公文像雪片般飛來。克里當特須躬親處理，儘量由他批覆，務使轉遞總統辦理的事務，减低至最小限度。</p>
<p>這一位大總統的捉刀人，曾任羅斯福總統幕僚薩繆爾。魯士枚推事的下屬，惟歷時頗短，後者却就是羅斯福總統的捉刀者。</p>
<p>逢到克里富特案命擬稿時，他須蒐集資料，剔出一部，留用若干，口述初稿，由秘書逐句錄下。之後，他將原稿仔細修正，斟酌一字一句的意義與份量，有時須修改至十次之多，他的擬稿竣事後，十九僅由杜總統略爲改　數字。最後脫稿的演說辭，雖然沒有細斯福及魯士枚合撰文字的那樣鋒鋩畢露，咄咄逼人，或者辭意蘊藉，但是往往言簡意賅，內容完整，琅琅可讀。</p>
<p>先是，克里富特跨進白宮之前，早年在聖路易攻習法律，後任該城律師，　　鵲起，二次大戰期間，在海軍中服役，頭角嶄露，由少尉積功晋陞至上校，復得老友萬達曼的奧援，入總統府任海軍參贊之職，深得杜魯門總統的賞識，他的前途，正不可限量呢。</p>
<h3>新「鑄情」</h3>
<p>— 稼南</p>
<p>更德，渥弗同他美麗的女友露慧絲，像羅米歐和朱麗葉那樣地殉情了。</p>
<p>更　，十九歲，生前是攻讀柏米的醫科大學生，同他母親住在柏林的法國區內一所小平房中，他父親是仍留居在蘇聯的戰俘。讀大學時，更德加入了反共社會民主黨，可是他不演說，也不參加集會，只是在家裏帮帮忙，在學校裏做功課，之外便常去看他的女友——露慧絲。</p>
<p>露慧絲的父親，一個共產社會聯合黨的官員，他對一切反共份子，痛恨之極；當他發覺更德是入了社會民主黨的，馬上下了逐客令，不准更德再進他家的門。</p>
<p>兩星期前，他得了一個朋友的電話，他答應去訪問那朋友，於是他走向柏林的蘇聯區去，剛一踏出地下道車站，便被幾個秘密警察抓上監禁車，凑巧的是那車子在半路上翻了，更德逃了命。</p>
<p>第二天，他把自已的遭遇報告社會民主黨的區然部，隨後他被送至該黨總黨部，因爲在那裏有解決與更總類似問題的特別部門。向總部說明後，更德接了一封來自蘇區的恐嚇信，還有一封，又來一封，他恐懼，他沮喪，他跑回他的總黨部作更詳盡的申訴。總部告訴他處境危險，願意送他離開柏林。</p>
<p>最初，他覺得能離開柏林而高興，旣而他想到露慧絲——想到自己的前途——想到了集中營。他拿定了主意，把毒藥放在衣袋裏，去會見被禁的情人。夜色蒼茫的時候，在斯賓得勒司費近郊的樹林裏，警察找到更德和露慧絲，交相擁抱着，與世長辭了。（譯自「時代」雜誌）</p>

<h3>My Proposal for Financial and Economic Reforms to be Considered by the US Government; Secretary of State Marshall Meets with Bei and Koo to Discuss the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[Washington, DC, United States Information Service, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall declared that the US government would consider the ten-point reform plan proposed in the statement by the Chinese government. He stated that the aid to China proposal had been fully approved by the International Financial Advisory Committee and had been submitted to the Budget Bureau. Once the Budget Bureau has completed its review, it will be submitted to Congress.</p>
<p>[Washington, DC, United Press, 28th] Treasury Secretary Snyder confirmed that the National Financial Advisory Committee, of which he is the chairman, has received the aid to China plan and is studying it. However, he declined to comment in more detail.</p>
<p>[Washington, DC, Central News Agency, 28th] Marshall held a meeting on the 28th with Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese technical delegation, for a general discussion on the US aid to China plan. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin also attended the fifty-minute meeting held at the State Department on the afternoon of the 28th and announced the above news to reporters afterward. According to Bei, the delegation has held three meetings with State Department officials, all of which were of a purely technical nature. When asked by reporters whether China had requested military assistance in addition to technical assistance, Koo replied that China would welcome any kind of assistance. China had not proposed any specific figures to the State Department, but would propose other plans for China's post-war recovery and reconstruction. After meeting with Secretary Marshall, Bei Zuyi also had discussions with Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Bureau of the State Department.</p>
<p>[Washington, DC, Central News Agency, United Press, 28th] After meeting with US Secretary of State Marshall, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin told the press that the $300 million US aid to China plan would enable China to get a start in construction, but the overall construction work would require more time and more money. Today, Koo, accompanied by Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese technical delegation, went to the State Department for a meeting with Marshall, after which he stated that they had a general discussion with Marshall on the overall situation in China. The technical delegation has held three meetings with US officials. Koo concluded by saying that China's plan for developing the Yangtze River has been put on hold pending the outcome of the request for US assistance. [This newspaper's report] Zhang Junmai, who is studying in the United States, recently sent a letter to members of the Democratic Socialist Party, saying that he had met with Marshall and Wedemeyer in Washington. Economic aid to China was the theme of the conversation, and the total amount of US aid would be more than $300 million. [United Press, approx. 28th] A World Telegram editorial on the 28th stated that both the Chinese and American governments should be held responsible for the crisis in the nine eastern provinces of China, but the time for assigning blame has now passed. What remains to be seen is the actions of President Truman and President Chiang. Washington and Nanjing should quickly unite, forget mutual recriminations, rush necessary American supplies and dispatch advisors to replace any Chinese civil and military officials who cannot produce the same aid effect.</p>
<h3>Major General Barr Speaks in Nanjing Praising the Greatness of Our Nation; Commences Internal Inspection of the Advisory Group Today</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The newly appointed head of the US Army Advisory Group, Major General Barr, held a press conference in his office at around 8:00 a.m. on the 29th. The chief of external liaison, Keith, introduced the reporters to Barr one by one, and after exchanging pleasantries, Barr gave a speech at 8:30. He began by praising the greatness of the Chinese nation, especially the completion of the arduous Stilwell Road project by manual labor, which made him feel eternally admired. He was extremely happy to learn about China and to be friends with Chinese people. This time, he was ordered to come to China to take up his duties, hoping to be an assistant to President Chiang and serve Sino-US military cooperation. He did not intend to make any major changes to the organization of the advisory group for the time being, but would slowly change it as needed. He had met with General Rooks in the government and the conversation had been very helpful. Rooks has now gone to Panama to take up a temporary position. Barr visited the restaurant run by the Lixingshe on the morning of the 29th to see his subordinates having meals. After hosting the reporters, he will meet with his subordinates separately. In the afternoon, around 2:00 p.m., he will visit Lin Wei, acting chief of the general staff of our Ministry of National Defense, and at 6:00 p.m., he will attend Ambassador Stuart's cocktail party and be introduced to many of our military leaders. He is scheduled to be in full contact with his subordinates on the 30th, and inspect the inside of the advisory group. In the evening, he will go to the Officers' Club to meet with his subordinates and their families. On the morning of the 31st, after talking to the officers and soldiers of the advisory group, he will continue to inspect the inside of the advisory group. In the afternoon, he will visit Qixia Mountain to visit the artillery training center. He will rest on the 1st of next month (Sunday), visit the Chinese Ministry of National Defense on the 2nd, attend Ambassador Stuart's banquet in the evening, and fly to Shanghai on the 3rd for inspection. After that, he will go to Hankou, Beiping and other places to inspect the work of the advisory group in those areas. Barr came to China alone on this trip. He plans to have his two daughters, who are currently studying at university in the United States, come to China for the summer vacation this year. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] US Ambassador Stuart Leighton Stuart held a cocktail party for Major General Barr at his residence on the evening of the 29th to entertain the heads of our government and military and diplomatic missions in China. Those present included Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Ye Gongchao, Gan Naiguang, Lin Wei, Qin Dechun, Guo Chan, Zhou Zhirou, Gui Yongqing and many military attachés of diplomatic missions in China.</p>
<p>Improving Tax Revenue; Three Decisions by the Tax Bureau [This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Direct Taxation Administration has held business review meetings for several days, and has obtained three important decisions for future work, improving the collection of income tax: For the collection method of profit-seeking enterprise income tax, an apportionment method will be used. For the collection of interest income tax, the Monetary Management Bureau will jointly inspect the transaction ledgers of silver houses and banks, and strengthen the cooperation with the Customs Goods Tax Bureau and the Monetary Management Bureau. Property tax can be paid in kind, and restrictions on the use of the registered name will be added to property registration. Combined with household registration visits, the inheritance tax collection can be successfully promoted. Special business tax will be collected in a consolidated manner, while striving to control tax sources and tax revenue. The heads of the local branch offices of the bureau attended the meeting, which was presided over by Wang Fuzhou. The 29th was the last day, and the adjustment of tax agencies, personnel coordination, and accounting issues will be discussed. It will close in the afternoon. The Cotton Yarn Control Committee Will Establish Offices Throughout the Country [This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The six detailed implementation rules for the overall control of cotton yarn will be announced soon. It is heard that in order to implement the original purpose of controlling cotton yarn, the Cotton Yarn Control Committee will establish 17 offices throughout the country, and station resident factory staff in various factories to supervise the handling.</p>
<h3>The List of Elected National Assembly Delegates Still Awaits Announcement</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The announcement of the list of elected National Assembly delegates is still pending, because many non-Kuomintang people who were nominated were not elected. Although the Kuomintang tried its best to concede under the method of concession to friendly parties, there are still those who are hindered by social elites and those who have too few votes to qualify as substitute candidates. It is estimated that there are more than 50 people from the Democratic Socialist Party and more than 30 people from the Youth Party. The Kuomintang has copied this list and sent it to the two parties on the 28th and 29th respectively, asking them to find a solution. The two parties are currently discussing it separately.</p>
<h3>The Key to the Kowloon Walled City and Shamian Incidents Remains Sovereignty; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Completes All Negotiation Preparations</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] There was no development in the Sino-British negotiations on the 29th. The stalemate in the disagreement between the two sides on the Kowloon Walled City issue has made our government's standing committee pay more attention to the basic reasons for discussing the issue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has completed the necessary preparations and is ready to engage in any procedure of negotiation at any time. A spokesperson for the British Embassy frankly admitted that the current deadlock in the negotiations lies in three matters: The issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon Walled City, the issue of the release of arrested residents, and the issue of compensation. However, according to those who understand the details of the Kowloon Walled City negotiations, although the deadlocks have different manifestations, the underlying cause is still the issue of sovereignty. Taking the second point as an example, China's position originally recognized that the Hong Kong government had no right to arrest residents in Kowloon Walled City, and the Hong Kong court had no right to govern this case. Therefore, Foreign Minister Wang had instructed Ambassador Zheng Tianxi in the middle of this month to engage in serious negotiations with the British government, requesting the immediate release of the two arrested residents as the first step in the negotiations. However, the British side completely disagreed with this, maintaining the dignity of the Hong Kong government as before and ignoring it. From this point of view, it is extremely difficult for the British side to hope in its note of the 24th that the issue of jurisdiction and the issue of eviction can be handled separately in resolving the Kowloon Walled City incident. At the same time, officials of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs also did not deny on the 29th that the negotiations involved basic principles and that it was difficult to reach a complete agreement quickly. A senior official discussed the future of Kowloon Walled City and even the entire Kowloon leased territory with reporters. He also acknowledged some reasoning: Since the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty in January of the second year of the Republic of China, all relations between China and Britain, including rights and obligations, should be re-evaluated in the spirit of equality and reciprocity in the Sino-British New Treaty. Regarding the Kowloon leased territory, our side considered our wartime allies and did not take it back at the same time, but we also declared that we reserved our rights. In terms of the law itself, the new treaty is superior to the old treaty, and the existence of the Kowloon leased territory undoubtedly violates the spirit of the treaty and is the last remnant of unequal treaties. Therefore, if we raise this issue at an appropriate time, our allies will have no reason to refuse to consider it. Moreover, if this issue cannot be avoided at any opportunity, we do not intend to evade it. Therefore, it is impossible to predict or limit the extent to which the negotiations on the Kowloon Walled City incident today will extend, and it depends on the extent to which both sides can compromise.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] According to a person in charge of the Democratic Socialist Party, the rumors that our party will run for president and vice president are completely untrue. The list of elected National Assembly delegates will be announced at the same time as the list of elected legislators due to various difficulties. The government plans to establish a semi-official institution to accommodate more than 200 National Assembly delegate candidates who have been affected by the supplementary measures for political party nominations. Xu Fulin, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party's Fu Committee, strongly advocated this.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Transportation of Coal from the North to the South; A Large Supply is Expected</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiwei Goes to Peiping to Discuss Transportation [This newspaper, Tianjin, 29th] Regarding strengthening the transportation of coal from the north to the south and solving the coal shortage in Jiangnan, after Zhang Xiwei, chairman of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, came north to seek a solution, there is hope for a large supply. The total stock of coal in Kaiyuan Coal Mine has reached 800,000 tons, which is urgently waiting to be transported out. The difficulty lies only in transportation. Zhang and the persons in charge of Kaiyuan Coal Mine and Tianjin Fuel Management have jointly visited Li Zongren and Fu Zuoyi, requesting them to ensure the security of the Beining Railway, and will also visit Shi Zhiren, director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, requesting a large amount of transportation. Recently, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters has launched new measures to protect the railway, and the situation of coal transportation from the north to the south can be improved.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Customs Continuously Cracks Down on Two Gold Smuggling Cases</h3>
<p>A Total of More Than 1,300 Taels Seized [This newspaper, Fuzhou, 29th] Smuggling is rampant in South China.

<h3>The Main Smuggling Base Has Moved From Hong Kong to Macau</h3>
<p>Merchants Evade Taxes by Shipping Goods to Macau [This newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] The technical issues of the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement have been resolved after Ding Guitang arrived in Hong Kong to negotiate, and it will be implemented soon. We will set up checkpoints in certain sections of Hong Kong and send personnel to jointly conduct inspections with Hong Kong Customs. It is recently learned that in order to evade taxes, Hong Kong merchants are mostly shipping goods to Macau, and then smuggling them into the mainland from Macau. This move has replaced Hong Kong's position as the "smuggling base camp". The amount of goods shipped from Hong Kong to Macau has been unprecedented since the restoration, and all goods except tobacco and alcohol are tax-free, so smuggling is increasing. If the Macau authorities do not assist in anti-smuggling, the Hong Kong agreement will still be difficult to achieve.</p>

<h3>Adjustment Measures for Employees of China Textile Company and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Determined; China Fisheries Company to Be Sold by Issuing Half of Its Shares; Important Cases Approved by National Economic Council</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The National Economic Council (全經會) held its 32nd meeting on the afternoon of the 29th. Zhang Qun and Wang Yunwu were absent, and Chen Lifu chaired the meeting. First, Gu Yuzhen, Deputy Secretary-General, reported on the price fluctuations in the past week, stating that the price fluctuations in the week were minimal and the situation was good. Then, the discussion of the proposals began, and the following was approved: A. The salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Company (中紡公司) and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) should be gradually reduced to comply with the "Measures for Adjusting the Salaries of Employees of State-Owned Enterprises" passed by the State Council. The measures are as follows: Except for the ship employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company who join the Maritime Workers' Union, and the original adjustment method will still be used (i.e., adjusted monthly according to the index), all others will be adjusted according to the new method starting from January of this year. The adjustment period should be the same as the adjustment period for public school teachers, that is, once every three months, and should not be adjusted monthly. The adjustment percentage should be 70% of the adjustment increase percentage for civil servants (because the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises are three times higher than those of civil servants). For example, if the salaries of public school teachers increase by 100%, the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises can only increase by 70%. Each adjustment should be reduced by 10% until it meets the "Measures for Adjusting the Salaries of Employees of State-Owned Enterprises" (that is, the salaries can only be 30% higher than the salaries of civil servants). Each adjustment must be approved by the competent department. Expenses should be reduced and expenditures should be reduced. All surpluses should be handed over to the national treasury and cannot be used or hidden at will. If adjusted according to this method, the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises can meet the regulations after one year. B. The sale of the China Fisheries Company (中華水產公司) will be based on the price assessment of the Ministry of Agriculture, using 1937 as the standard, with a remaining value of 2.81 million yuan. It is now revalued according to the price index in October 1937, which is about 160 to 70 billion yuan. Half will be temporarily retained as government shares, and half will be sold by issuing shares. C. The method of selling the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company (中國紡織機製造公司) is that the 40% government shares of the company should be transferred to commercial shares two years after the company was established in accordance with the original contract. February of this year has reached the transfer period, so it is decided to transfer commercial shares. The price assessment work will be handled by the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises. D. Foreign companies apply to establish companies in China. 5. Chen Butong, Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Hongjun, etc., will conduct preliminary secret investigations.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] At the regular meeting of the National Economic Council (全經會) on the 29th, the implementation measures for the commercial part of the economic reform plan were discussed. The original plan (4) "Trial barter trade" was cancelled at the last regular meeting. Chen Lifu requested to restore it on the 29th, believing that the reason for canceling the provision in the original plan that the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office should try out barter trade with international cooperative organizations was because some people doubted the ability of Chinese cooperatives. In fact, Chinese cooperatives may not necessarily be unable to bear this responsibility. After discussion, the original plan (4) was restored in principle to try out barter trade, but the content was revised. The issue of the import and export linkage system for international trade was also raised again on the 29th. Tong Jiling advocated that international trade should adopt an import and export linkage system. Some people opposed it at the meeting, and the discussion lasted for a long time. However, it was generally believed that American aid was more promising, and the import and export linkage system for international trade was a general trend, which needed to be considered. Finally, it was passed in principle, but this is only one of the provisions of the implementation measures for the commercial part of the economic reform plan, and it is still difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Condolences to the Mayor and Regret for Education!</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the long-brewing storm at Tongji University in this city finally escalated. The chaotic and expanding situation is simply beyond reasonable prediction. Mayor Wu personally went to the university yesterday morning to mediate at the request of the students, but unexpectedly, he was violently beaten by the student mob. Fortunately, the mayor was extremely patient. Even when he was about to be beaten to the ground by the students, he shouted loudly to prevent the military police from firing, so that the conspirators who deliberately created a mass tragedy could not carry out their scheme. Mayor Wu's magnanimity and spirit are truly admirable. From the time he entered Tongji in the morning to the time he was beaten in the afternoon until late at night, he still insisted on staying near the school, insisting that the academic atmosphere must be rectified, and he did not eat lunch or dinner. The mayor is working so hard for the local area and for education, and we especially want to express our sincere condolences.</p>
<p>The Tongji University student organization's self-government association does not comply with the regulations issued by the Ministry of Education, and President Ding's refusal to recognize it is justified. Even if the students have reasons, they can make a statement. However, they often go on strike, and a few students even move their bedding into the classrooms, occupy them, and prevent other students who are willing to study from being able to do so. They can only be manipulated by them. This is no longer the action that ordinary students should take. The school authorities chose the most important ones and gave them the punishment of expulsion or probation, which is also within the scope of their duties. Moreover, even with these punishments, if the students want to ask the school to be lenient, there are professors and alumni who can mediate. Why do the students insist on petitioning in Nanjing? Even more strangely, this is only a matter for Tongji and has nothing to do with other schools. However, yesterday, some university and middle school students went in groups to say goodbye and cheer them on. May we ask: What kind of original intention did the students of each school have when they first entered the school? After the teams gathered at Tongji, they were not satisfied with the noise and commotion, and finally resorted to violence, assaulting and insulting the mayor. The actions of the young people in the dignified academic institution are so perverse. What kind of system will be established? For decades, the country has spent countless money on education, and society has placed countless expectations on young people. But now it has come to this. We not only feel sorry for the young people, but also cannot help but cry for the future of the nation!</p>
<p>Now that the Tongji storm has escalated to this point, we believe that the education authorities must make a great determination and thoroughly rectify the academic atmosphere; otherwise, if they continue to muddle along and only seek to whitewash for a while, it will be even more difficult to clean up in the future. Whether it is the education minister or the school teachers, if they do not correct the decadent atmosphere of the school, they will not only harm the young people, but also be ashamed of the students' parents and the nation. The students who assaulted and insulted the mayor must be punished according to the law; other expelled members should be ordered to leave the school. As for the students of other schools, the principals of each school should lead them back separately and give them supervision or punishment. Conspirators who pretend to be students and mix in to cause trouble, and blind followers who carry leaflets and pamphlets of the Communist Party and spread them on the spot during this period of mobilization, should be brought to justice and prevented from succeeding in their evil plans. It must be understood that the situation today is already clear. The Tongji storm is not a simple internal school problem, but a link in the conspiracy of the hidden conspirators in Shanghai to create unrest for the Communist Party. Since Commander Xuan and Mayor Wu have jointly issued a statement the day before yesterday, emphasizing winter defense and maintaining security, they should do their best to prevent this kind of conspiracy that wants to use the school storm and young people as their capital for unrest, so as to curb the budding of turmoil.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "By treading on hoarfrost, one knows that solid ice is coming." It also said, "When one leaf falls, one knows that autumn is coming." From this storm at Tongji, we can see two points:</p>
<p>First, the decline of the academic atmosphere did not start today. If we still do not thoroughly rectify it today and try to correct the decadent atmosphere, then from autumn to winter, the bleak atmosphere will be even more unimaginable. Students beat the bureau chief last year, and beat the mayor this year. If this continues, the students will become thugs, and the violence will spread everywhere. Why should the country and society train these thugs? We know that this is only the behavior of a few tyrannical people, and it is definitely not what the majority of good students want to see. However, the majority of good students are a heap of loose sand, without organization, and only allow those few "professional students" to combine and charge around, and they have really become a bad influence. Teachers must be strict and then the truth can be respected. Today, we want to call for the rectification of the academic atmosphere. In particular, we want to ask the government and society to respect teachers and value the Tao with twelve points, so that teachers with both good character and learning can take on the responsibility of leading students. At the same time, they should do everything possible to stabilize the school environment and protect the right of general good students to study.</p>
<p>Second, in recent years, education has neglected a fundamental point, which is the principle of being a human being. In general schools, whether universities or middle schools, whether liberal arts or science, teachers who can teach young students how to be human beings through their own words and deeds are now as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. It is even questionable whether teachers can recognize a few of the students they teach. There is no emotional connection between teachers and students, and even less is there an appeal to personality. Not only do they become strangers as soon as they leave the school gate, but they also regard the lecture halls and classrooms as teahouses and taverns. In such an environment, good teachers can only sigh secretly and cannot do anything. And a group of young students who are roughly made are often very self-righteous and arrogant, do not pay attention to politeness, and have no consideration at all. How can we hope that they will take on great responsibilities in the future, and how can we hope that they will understand the times? Naturally, there must be fragrant grass within a hundred steps, and there must be loyalty and trustworthiness in ten households. There are of course truly patriotic and studious talents among young students, and the expectations of the country and society for them are forever earnest. However, the decadent atmosphere has spread and is waiting to be salvaged. If the authorities in charge of education still want to avoid treatment and hide their illness, and if those who bear the expectations of society only know how to cater to the crowd and refuse to point out the lost way and change course, then the harm to the country in five or ten years will be unimaginable. Yesterday's violent actions of Tongji students are only a small matter!</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Executes Three Corrupt Military Officers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense executed three corrupt military officers, Su Boyun, Liang Xianbang, and Qin Zhong, on the 29th. Su Boyun was a 54-year-old male from Chaoan County, Guangdong Province, and a colonel specialist of the Navy in the Hainan Island area. Liang Xianbang was a 37-year-old male and a former lieutenant colonel commander of the Yuehai Patrol Fleet. Qin Zhong was a 38-year-old male from Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, and a former colonel director of the Hong Kong Receiving Group of the Guangzhou Naval Commissioner's Office. In September 1946, Su Boyun transported supplies on the Dazhen ship to the Dongsha Islands, and met Liang Xianbang in Hong Kong. Liang requested him to provide documents certifying the naval vessels in the area to cover merchant ships to avoid customs inspection and smuggling. Su agreed to his request, issued the assigned documents, and accepted a bribe of 3,000 Hong Kong dollars from Liang. On November 11 of the same year, the merchant ships were changed to Hainan Boat Nos. 467 and 468, and smuggled goods were loaded and transported from Hong Kong to Guangdong. The smuggled goods were seized by the naval fleet at sea in Guangzhou and handed over to the navy for legal processing. Su and Liang were detained. Qin Zhong accepted bribes and committed fraud in Hong Kong when receiving ships and renting them to merchants for repair and use. The Naval Headquarters sent the offenders to the Ministry of National Defense for interrogation. After investigation by the Ministry, it was confirmed that Su Boyun was guilty of accepting bribes, and Liang Xianbang and Qin Zhong were directly profiting from the matters in charge. They were sentenced to death and deprived of their civil rights for life. After being submitted for approval, the three offenders were bound to the execution ground at 9:00 a.m. today and executed by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Actively Losing West Germany Reform Plan, Britain, America and France Consult, France Insists on Opposing Centralized System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] There has been positive progress in the negotiations among Western powers on the West German issue. Following the agreement between experts from Britain, France, and the United States to gradually and completely incorporate electricity, coal, and gas into the French economy, a British Foreign Office spokesman reiterated that the proposals submitted by France to Britain and the United States regarding the reform resolution of the Frankfurt Anglo-American merged zone are being given the most serious consideration. It is therefore not impossible that the Frankfurt resolution will be amended. It can be seen from this that the British and American authorities, before the Anglo-American-French meeting on the future status of Germany is held in London in mid-February, will slightly revise the new resolution based on French opinions and put it into effect. This is tantamount to submitting it to the meeting of the three powers of Britain, America, and France as an accomplished fact. Under these circumstances, it is expected that France will lodge another protest. Although official details about the meeting of the three powers have not yet been revealed, if the future economic status of West Germany is discussed in detail at the meeting, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will inevitably demand full participation in the discussion. If the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg can eventually join the international control regime in the Ruhr area together with Britain, America, and France, France's fear of Germany's resurgence and the possible establishment of a centralized German central government in Frankfurt can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] It is reported that France has submitted notes to London and Washington regarding the reform plan proposed by the authorities of the Anglo-American merged zone in Germany, suggesting the establishment of deductions in the merged zone and giving German states and state parliaments some centralized powers to strengthen the federal nature of Germany. France's suggestions include five points, which are presented in the form of questions, including: (1) Why is the power of the state parliaments smaller than the power of the Frankfurt Executive Committee? (2) Why is the power to levy taxes given to the central administrative机构而不是给予邦政府机构？机构？邦政府？(3) Why is the chairman of the Executive Committee not appointed by the Advisory Committee, but by the Economic Committee? (4) Why should the governors of the provinces and their officials work together in Frankfurt, but the independent authorities of the two countries must exercise their powers at different levels? (5) Regarding the议关于合并区中央法院，为什么不允每邦得有司法长一人，由该邦总理任命？</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] Commenting on the new resolutions on administrative reform in the Anglo-American merged zone in Germany, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry認為英美業已步入走向行政無能，或重建集權德國之路。 The French government已恰如会为会合英美，就前项决议提出具体意见，并法国何以采取保留态度之理由。 法车认为对待德国各邦的态度，非为向各邦呼唤合作，即为使用压力以胁迫各邦代表之权力，后者必致引起德国中央政府之重建，卒至再有极权制度的出现。</p>

Because the Soviet Union does not want the复兴欧洲复兴以威胁威胁安全也。史氏继称，共产主义诚有一国际性之威胁，但不信苏联正进行帝国主义。</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall Agrees to Franc Devaluation</h3>
<p>Believes it Will Help European Reconstruction</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall declared today that France must devalue its currency in order to fulfill its mission within the framework of the European Recovery Program. However, this devaluation has formed a misunderstanding. Mr. Marshall firmly believes that the devaluation will have no adverse consequences for France's mission in the European Recovery Program, and said that the franc devaluation is in line with the documents drawn up by the sixteen countries at the Paris meeting. Mr. Marshall said that in this document, every participating country will guarantee the stability of its tendency and budget. Mr. Marshall went on to say that the need to stabilize the monetary system was raised in the European Recovery Program, so the devaluation of the franc is a step closer to the recommendations of the European Recovery Program. He said that the differences in opinion between Britain, the International Monetary Fund, and France have no impact on the devaluation, but only on the implementation method. Finally, Marshall declared that the franc devaluation does not affect the total amount of US aid to Europe, because all raw materials and goods are paid for at about the same price.</p>
<h3>Recalling Large Denomination Franc Notes</h3>
<p>Parliamentary Finance Committee Opposes</p>
<p>All Banks Closed for Two Days</p>
<p>[Report] London, 29th Radio: Paris dispatch, the French National Assembly Finance Committee refused to accept the government's proposal to recall all 5,000 franc denomination banknotes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] It was learned tonight that Prime Minister Schumann has reached an agreement with the Socialist Party on the government's proposed free gold trading bill, and the cabinet crisis is gradually easing. The bill may pass parliament by a few votes, but whether the Socialist Party cabinet members will continue to serve is still in doubt.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] The French government today ordered all French banks to close for two days to prevent speculation when parliament debates the free gold trading bill. The French government also ordered a temporary ban on the use of 5,000 franc notes as a medium of exchange.</p>
<h3>Three-Power Conference Secretary Marshall Does Not Express Opinion</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] US Secretary of State Marshall was recently asked by reporters today whether the three powers of the Soviet Union and Britain will hold a three-power conference to collect important current world issues, but Secretary Marshall refused to answer, only saying that this matter has not yet been answered until it is studied with President Truman.</p>
<h3>Marshall Opposes Reduction in 6.8 Billion Yuan European Aid Amount Only Concessions Can Be Made in Management</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall, hearing that supporters of the Marshall Plan in Congress intend to propose a compromise to reduce the total amount of aid to Europe in order to avoid a larger reduction, stated that he firmly opposes any reduction in the 6.8 billion yuan cost of European aid in the first fifteen months. But he stated that he is prepared to accept compromise suggestions on other parts of the bill, including the proposal of Vandenberg, who advocates not giving the State Department a veto power, but only giving the Secretary of State the power to make recommendations on diplomatic issues to the program administrator. Those close to Vandenberg said that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has tentatively decided to reduce the aid expenditure in the first fifteen months to 5.5 billion yuan to avoid a larger reduction.</p>
<h3>Two Congressional Foreign Affairs Committees Listen to Opinions from All Parties</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Former Secretary of State Acheson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the European Recovery Program is the first line of defense for US security. He pointed out that the Soviet Union is doing its best to prevent Europe's recovery, and if Western Europe can restore its ability to be self-reliant, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can also be improved. Mr. Acheson urged Congress to approve the 6.8 billion yuan cost of European aid in the first fifteen months and insisted that it should not be reduced. The "National Association of Manufacturers", which is powerful and controls most of the major industries and banks in the country, submitted written opinions to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, advocating that aid should not be given to countries that implement socialist car management policies, and advocating the establishment of a non-partisan committee, not subject to the interference of the State Department, to manage the Marshall Plan. Former Senator Lafollette, who is believed to be taking office as the general manager of the Marshall Plan, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, arguing that the Marshall Plan should be managed by the State Department.</p>
<h3>Saar Coal Production Agreement Three Countries Have Signed</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 28th] According to official claims, Britain, America, and France have signed an agreement on the Saar coal mines, stipulating that 30% of the coal produced by the Saar coal mines in 1948 will be given to France as a priority. From April 1, 1949, the total annual coal production of the Saar security zone can reach 12 million tons.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] When asked what steps still need to be completed when the Saar economy is integrated into France, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry replied that not much needs to be completed. Only the general business relations between the Saar region and the outside world, especially Germany, still need to be arranged. Negotiations on this matter are in progress.</p>
<h3>Lebanon Proposes Establishment of Nine-Nation Committee</h3>
<p>Assist the United Nations in Peacefully Resolving Various Disputes Among Organizations</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 28th] Lebanon has proposed the establishment of a permanent nine-nation conciliation committee, appointed by the UN Small General Assembly, so that the committee can study any dispute before it is submitted to the Security Council or the General Assembly, and offer suggestions for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<h3>Japan Decides on Foreign Capital Acquisition: Formulates Policy to Prevent Foreign Manipulation, Only Accepts Loans, Does Not Welcome Investment</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Today's cabinet meeting decided on a surprising resolution regarding the policy of using foreign capital to revitalize Japan's post-war industry. The points of the resolution are as follows: 1) Accepting loans in major industrial sectors, but not welcoming foreign investment; 2) In several industries urgently needing foreign capital, the government will allow foreigners to participate in managerial positions; 3) Foreign investment must be accompanied by the import of foreign raw materials; only then will it be approved by Japan. The grade and import methods of these raw materials will be determined separately; 4) Religious, cultural, and tourism-related businesses are welcome for foreign investment, but industries of critical importance to Japan are not welcomed. Foreign observers believe that Japan, while accepting foreign capital to revive its industry, is already formulating its future economic policy. The trend of this policy is similar to that of the pre-war era, and foreign capital will be handled with extreme caution in the future to prevent other countries from controlling its industry.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] According to the Silk Industry Management Bureau, Japan's current raw silk production is about one-sixth of the highest production year before the war, 1930, with a monthly output of about 10,000 bales. The current standard will be maintained.</p>
<h3>Iraqi Anti-British Cabinet Established: Former Prime Minister Jabr Flees to Amman; Difficulties Arise in Renegotiating Anglo-Jordanian Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Baghdad, 29th] The new Iraqi cabinet has been established, with independent party member and former Senate Speaker Al-Sayed Muhammad al-Sadr as Prime Minister. The new cabinet includes many former ministers. The full list is as follows:</p>
<p>Minister of Interior: Matfi, Minister of Foreign Affairs: Bagji, Minister of Supplies: Hedar, Minister of Finance: Bassan, Minister of Public Works: Baban, Minister of Education: Moctar, Minister of Social Affairs: Lavee, Minister of Economy: Koba, Minister of Justice: Nasmi, Minister of Defense: Omari (named Mostafa). In addition, there are two ministers without portfolio: Omari (named Elmanat) and Farisi.</p>
<p>[United Press, Baghdad, 29th] Newly resigned Prime Minister Jabr, fearing arrest, has fled by plane to Amman, the capital of Transjordan. The new cabinet seems to be adopting an entirely anti-British stance, regardless of the significant oil concessions and two British air force bases that Britain possesses in Iraq. On the 27th, ten thousand Iraqis held a large anti-British demonstration, resulting in clashes, with twenty deaths and another two hundred thirty-five injuries. The Regent then declared the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty invalid, on the grounds that the treaty allowed Britain to continue using two airports in Iraq and to send troops into Iraqi territory in the event of a threat of war. The treaty was considered detrimental to Iraqi sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Transjordan has requested the revision of the entire 1946 Anglo-Transjordanian treaty, not just the review of the military annex to the treaty, which was the original goal of the current Anglo-Transjordanian talks. It is understood that the Transjordanian delegation has submitted a new draft of the Anglo-Transjordanian treaty. Due to this development, after a meeting held today, it has been decided to postpone the meeting for two days. Although Transjordan's move was unexpected by the British side, Britain is currently trying to establish a new treaty system with the Arab world, so it is expected that Bevin will not reject Transjordan's request to revise the entire treaty outright.</p>
<h3>American Cats "Aid Europe":</h3>
<p>European Rats Compete with Starving People for Food.</p>
<p>50,000 Cats to Be Sent to Exterminate Them.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] The American Cat Society is preparing to seek 50,000 cats in thirty-nine states and Canada, as well as Costa Rica, to be shipped to Europe.</p>
<p>This plan was formulated because the London Daily Mirror emphasized in a front-page editorial that Europe needs millions of cats to catch the rats that are competing with the starving people of Europe for food.</p>
<p>The president of the Cat Society, Condan, emphatically stated: "We don't need noble cats, just ordinary cats, and so far we haven't received any generous donations from cat owners." He said that this plan must first seek the approval of the State Department's foreign distribution.</p>
<h3>Plans to Establish a Balkan Federation: Disagreements Among Eastern European Communist Parties; London Circles Pay Attention to Soviet Newspaper's Tone</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Diplomatic circles here openly expressed their disapproval of the commentary published in the Soviet Communist Party's organ, "Pravda," on the 28th, which opposed the formation of a Balkan federation by the Balkan countries together with Poland and Czechoslovakia. The excitement felt by Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, who could be advised, was extremely great. The divisions in the historical views of Eastern European Communist Parties have been demonstrated by this. Moscow's opposition to the organization of a Slavic alliance including Poland and Czechoslovakia outside the Soviet Union has been declared in the most explicit way.</p>
<p>Dimitrov's deviation from the state independence policy stipulated in the declaration of the establishment of the Cominform on October 9th of last year has been openly prompted by Moscow to change his mind. Well-informed sources believe that Pravda's refusal to support Dimitrov's alteration of the Slavic federation outside the Soviet Union is based on the following reasons: 1) The Soviet Union is determined to maintain its leading position in the Pan-Slavic movement. 2) Bulgaria's hope to have the more industrially advanced Poland and Czechoslovakia participate in the Slavic Federation in order to assist the more backward southern Balkan countries is not created by the Soviet Union. 3) Moscow believes that the policies of communist countries can only be decided by Moscow. The Soviet Union is willing for the trade between Czechoslovakia and Poland to develop under Moscow's supervision, and does not want it to develop under an uncontrolled Balkan industrialization plan.</p>
<h3>US Establishes Air Force Base in Libya: Soviet Union Protests to Britain and the US, Accusing This Action of Violating the Italian Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Moscow Radio broadcast that the Soviet Union has formally protested to US Secretary of State Marshall, believing that the US's re-establishment of the Manla Air Force Base in Libya violates the treaty with Italy. The broadcast quoted a New York dispatch from TASS saying that the above protest was made on the 21st by the newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin. The protest pointed out that the establishment of an air force base by the United States in a former Italian territory temporarily controlled by Britain violates the treaty. The broadcast also said that the same protest has also been made to Britain.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] The US State Department stated today that it had received the Soviet Union's protest against the US's re-establishment of an air force base in Libya. It is believed that the State Department has not yet issued a response. Others said that when the United States negotiated with Italy, it fully complied with the treaty with Italy. Article 23 of the treaty with Italy stipulates that the "final disposition" of all Italian colonies, including Libya, should be jointly decided by the four powers within one year after the signing of the treaty. However, the annex stipulates that if the four powers cannot reach an agreement, the issue should be submitted to the United Nations. Since the four powers did not reach an agreement on this at the Paris conferences, they agreed that each colony should remain under British administration before a final decision is made.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Polish Trade Agreement Has No Political Conditions</h3>
<p>Polish Foreign Ministry Issues Statement</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 28th] A spokesman for the Polish Foreign Ministry said that the credit loan granted to Poland by the Soviet Union under the Soviet-Polish four-year trade agreement signed in Moscow on Monday does not have any political conditions attached. Some of the goods supplied by the Soviet Union to Poland may include military supplies, but there were no Polish military representatives present during the trade agreement negotiations. The Foreign Ministry spokesman also denied reports in foreign newspapers that the Red Army is setting up defenses on the Polish border.</p>
<h3>Indian Old Woman Dies at the Age of 125</h3>

<h3>India-Pakistan Negotiations Stalled: Security Council Continues Discussion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 28th] After the President of the Security Council, Belgian representative Yichenhoff, continued secret consultations with representatives from India and Pakistan, he reported to the Security Council today on the progress of the negotiations so far and suggested that the issue of a plebiscite in Kashmir be immediately discussed on the Security Council's agenda. The Belgian proposal was made after India and Pakistan reached an agreement on holding a plebiscite to determine whether the people of Kashmir would like to become part of India or Pakistan; today, the Indian representative argued that the Security Council's consideration of the plebiscite issue should not precede the immediate action to end the conflict, thus causing a procedural obstacle. The Security Council is scheduled to continue discussing this issue at noon tomorrow.</p>

<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 28th] Dr. Nguyen Gia Da, Deputy Prime Minister of the Viet Minh government, told United Press on the 28th that the Viet Minh army is currently stronger than it was a year ago when it began fighting with the French army.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guilin, 29th] Longzhou News: At 1:00 PM on the 20th, four Vietnamese planes dropped more than 20 bombs on the sugarcane village at Nakok near the No. 1 boundary marker on the Guizhou-Vietnam border east road, and flew towards Liangshan at around 4:00 PM.</p>

Its temporary headquarters are in Sydney.</p>

<p>US Evaluates Roxas as Pardoning Himself</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 28th] President Roxas today signed a decree pardoning about 30 percent of the 5,000 Filipino traitors who collaborated with Japan. Those accused of espionage are not included, but this move still requires parliamentary approval.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former Secretary of the Interior Ickes today criticized Philippine President Roxas' pardon of Filipino traitors, saying: "I have always believed that Roxas collaborated with Japan during the occupation period and has therefore lost his qualification. This pardon of Filipino traitors is like pardoning himself, so there is nothing strange about this pardon when viewed in this light."</p>
<h3>Japanese Law and Order Gone, Train Robbed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Since the beginning of the new year, Japan has continued the massacre of one hundred and two babies and the robbery of all bank employees. Recently, a train robbery occurred, causing the law and order of Japan to deteriorate daily. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, a train from Tokyo to Aomori was robbed by 150 bandits yesterday. They looted all the money and jewelry from the 2,000 passengers on board, including 200,000 yen in cash and countless gold jewelry.

<h3>Memoirs of Hull (5)</h3>
<p>North American Newspaper Alliance Copyright</p>
<p>Translated by this newspaper's translation office</p>
<p>Moray -- "The Man Who Controls the President"</p>
<p>The London Economic Conference was certainly disappointing, but there were also a few lighter moments. Mrs. Hull and I attended a banquet given by King George of England. Beforehand, we had planned an excursion into the countryside, requiring us to leave the banquet to go several miles outside the city. I tried to make the conference successful, but I didn't have the sufficient conditions. The tension at the time made me exceptionally tired. Given the circumstances, I felt that I should rest no matter what. The banquet hosted by the King of England was attended by distinguished guests from sixty-six countries, and it was very lively. After waiting for a considerable amount of time, I felt that waiting any longer would make our trip impossible. So I suggested that my companion and I should leave quietly, without attracting anyone's attention. I could not obtain a shortcut to where the King could see me. Later, I learned that just as I left, the King sent someone to summon me, but when he learned that I was no longer there, I notified the appropriate British officials, stating that if the King agreed, I hoped to have an audience with him. I immediately received a reply expressing approval. I found the King to be very democratic. He received me sincerely and expressed his deep admiration for the American people. Then we talked about the London Conference and its objectives for about thirty minutes in a harmonious and friendly atmosphere. We agreed on the importance of the items listed on the agenda and the need to achieve appropriate resolutions for each item. The King said that he hoped to meet me again at a later stage of the conference; unfortunately, this opportunity never came.</p>
<p>The impasse of the conference was already showing obvious signs. It was at that time that I received news that the President was sending Moray to London as a liaison officer to inform us of the latest developments in Washington. The dramatic performance of Moray flying to President Roosevelt's yacht to see the President, as well as the various noises and speculations about Moray leaving Washington and New York, began to spread in the newspapers, as if to give people everywhere the impression that he had come to London with new instructions or a new opinion from the President, and might even take over the American delegation. For the next seven days, he was at sea, and the conference was waiting for the right moment. London newspapers published the news in large headlines, saying that Moray -- "the man who controls the President" -- was coming to London to take care of American interests there. Parisian newspapers exaggerated even more, and were extremely reckless and disrespectful to me, pointing out that I was not capable of handling the current situation for my government.</p>
<p>The reception for Moray was unprecedented, second only to the reception of an emperor. A delegation of senior officials, journalists, and other figures rushed impulsively to Plymouth to greet him, vying to pay their respects. After he arrived in London, he came to my office to visit me, shook hands with me, greeted me, and met with the delegation. The press hoped that he would receive reporters, so I accompanied him, but I retreated behind, and in the eyes of the journalists, Moray seemed to be the only American worth seeing. Thereafter, I rarely saw Moray, until the final crisis arrived. I decided to put all the tools he needed in his hands to see how long he could last in this situation in London.</p>
<p>Not long after his arrival in London, Moray conveyed a message to me, asking me to convey to the delegation that he wanted to focus on the issue of currency stabilization. He immediately began talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain and Frederick Leith-Ross, Economic Advisor to the British Treasury. It is said that the first meeting was held at the American Embassy, and Moray lingered there.</p>
<p>In the following days, the prime ministers, premiers, and other top officials of various countries vied to meet with Moray, as if he were a "magical piper." I continued to retreat behind, as if I were the least important person, like a burden to the conference.</p>
<p>One time, Prime Minister MacDonald asked me, "Can you call Moray to see me? I want to talk to him." Then he changed his mind and added, "If you like, you can come too."</p>
<p>A few days later, MacDonald called me in and spoke to me as if a teacher were lecturing a schoolboy. He said, "In a conference like this, it is not customary to issue statements to the press (I had issued one or two), you know? It's simply not done."</p>
<p>I retorted, "It's also not usually more customary for the leader of another delegation to bypass me and negotiate directly with one of my staff."</p>
<p>But in all respects, MacDonald was a respectable figure, extremely capable, and eloquent. He could attract attention in any group within a short time. He was a well-read scholar with an astonishing amount of general knowledge, especially concerning government.</p>
<p>Some major diplomatic representatives and some foreign newspapers were casually saying that Moray had come to London not only as a liaison officer but as the President's representative, endowed with full powers, to an extent even above the delegation. Moray was aware of this early on. As this news spread rapidly in England and the attitude of the European continent was distinctly unfavorable to the delegation, especially to me, Moray acted as if he fully represented the American government under the competition of various prime ministers, premiers, and high-ranking dignitaries; although he outwardly repeatedly protested and denied these factors that occupied this position.</p>
<p>Moray negotiated an agreement to stabilize the currency and telegraphed the President, asking him to approve it. He was so confident that the President would accept his opinion that he even notified senior officials in the British and other governments that he would meet with them at 10 Downing Street at noon on June 30. Soon, he called my hotel, earnestly requesting me to go to 10 Downing Street to sign the agreement that he believed was about to be established. I quickly and frankly refused to go, and firmly stated that as the representative of the London Conference, I was irrelevant to the issue of currency stabilization. He continued to plead, but I cut off his attempts to talk further.</p>
<p>This bizarre situation could not last long and was bound to end with a showdown. This performance ended with the return of a telegram from the President, in which he rejected the agreement proposed by Moray. At that time, I was preparing to leave for Revedon, and as I walked out of the door near the steps of the hotel, Moray hurried down to see me and said, "A telegram has come from Washington, which is unfavorable to currency stabilization. We must find a way."</p>
<p>So I glared at him. I knew that he had exhausted his skills and that everything was over. I started talking to him. I began by saying, "You should go back. First, there's nothing you should be doing here." I explained this in several aspects. Then I went to my car and went to the countryside for the weekend, because after friendly urging, I had agreed to go.</p>
<p>When I returned to London, the President's famous "bomb speech" had already arrived, in which he forcefully rejected Moray's currency stabilization proposal and expressed his views to the London Conference in a strong tone. The President said that if the conference allowed itself to divert its attention from broader issues to a purely artificial, temporary, experimental suggestion that would only appeal to a few countries inclined to convert, he believed that "it would be a disaster, nothing less than a world tragedy." This news caused an uproar at the conference.</p>
<p>Within hours of this speech arriving, Governor James M. Cox, Deputy Head of our delegation, rushed to my office; part of his job, which I had stipulated, was that he should meet with MacDonald every day. He came in a state of great excitement and said, "The British and other countries are so outraged by the President's speech that they have decided to convene a meeting of the Steering Committee at noon today, and then the Committee will convene a plenary session tomorrow, and then announce the indefinite adjournment of the conference at the plenary session. In the resolution, they will place the entire responsibility for destroying the conference entirely on the President's head."</p>
<p>I concentrated all my efforts on preventing this development, in order to restore calm before it reached a point of no return.</p>
<p>I went to see MacDonald; I sincerely urged him to revise his attitude and said something in favor of the conference continuing to be convened regularly. He said very sharply that he had no intention of doing so. He complained that the President's speech had destroyed the conference and had also destroyed his -- MacDonald's -- political position. He had originally wanted to strengthen his position through the success of the conference. I had received news that MacDonald had said in private that he might now have to resign as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>When the Steering Committee reopened, even if there was a slight improvement, hope was still extremely slim.</p>
<p>I managed to get the opportunity to speak, giving an opening speech of about twenty minutes. I held fast to my original ambition, arguing that the world's sixty-six nations had unanimously agreed on the absolute necessity of convening this conference and taking action by the conference to resolve the many financial problems that urgently needed improvement, unless the entire international community was allowed to continue to approach complete collapse.</p>
<p>Representatives of various countries took turns speaking, some supporting MacDonald and some supporting me. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett, Japan's Ishii, and the Swedish representative firmly supported my position. Chamberlain also agreed with my opinion.</p>
<p>Our arguments against adjournment were quite moving and had the power to break the Anglo-French plan. The result was so sudden that I felt as surprised as I was amazed. Even Prime Minister MacDonald deviated from his original position and acted with us in the opposite direction. After two hours of debate, the conference agreed that the conference should continue.</p>
<p>The following three weeks were all talk on paper, as we searched for occasional topics to discuss.</p>
<p>Moray returned home. Beforehand, he sent a telegram to the President, which in nature was a harsh review of the delegation. He claimed that the entire delegation had failed to represent the President at the conference, with the exception of Pittman. In fact, Pittman was one of the least contributing members. His resolution on the silver issue was an exception, but very few people were interested in it. Moray naively sent this telegram using the State Department's code, and the contents were learned by the American delegation. Every representative except Pittman hated it.</p>
<p>On the night of July 27, I boarded the "President Harding" to return home. Before leaving London, I received a telegram from the President: "Before you depart, I want you to know once again my love and trust for you. You have coped with great difficulties. Your spirit is commendable, and through your own courage and sincerity, you have saved the principle of continued international discussion of complex world problems from disintegration, preventing further consideration from becoming impossible. When you arrive in New York next week, I will be at Hyde Park, and I very much hope that you and Mrs. Hull will come that night."</p>
<p>I should state that from that time on, the President decided that he would no longer give Moray any privileges, let alone the power to govern the American delegation. This came from the President's own will. He said that his intention was only to call Moray to London as a liaison officer to bring the news that the delegation might want to obtain, and return to the United States after a few days to bring back the news that the President might want to obtain from a dedicated patriot. He told me that he was extremely shocked by the hype surrounding the news of Moray's arrival in London, and by Moray's encouragement or tacit approval of external rumors, or both, the intentions of which were obvious. The President assigned Moray some upcoming work, and within a few weeks, transferred him out of the State Department.</p>

<h3>Mayor Was Assaulted But Tolerantly Mediated the Tongji University Student Unrest Resolved Classes Can Resume Today Copies of Communist Propaganda Were Seized Arrested Students Await Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] More than a thousand students from Tongji University yesterday wanted to go to Beijing to petition. Mayor Wu was invited by the school to mediate the situation and dissuade the students from disrupting production order. Unexpectedly, he was assaulted and humiliated, causing a great disturbance. From morning to dusk, the area around Kiangse Road was heavily guarded by police and military, and remained in a state of chaos and tension throughout the day. Fortunately, despite being attacked by the students, the police and military remained patient and did not resist, preventing any bloodshed. The Mayor maintained a calm attitude throughout the incident and stated that there were obvious signs that the Communist bandits were inciting the students behind the scenes, attempting to create a bloody incident and blame the government.</p>
<p>The standoff between the students and the authorities lasted until 2 AM this morning before it was resolved. As a result of the negotiations, the leaders of each class pledged to persuade the students to resume classes in full this afternoon. Mayor Wu and Commander Yi left Kiangse Road at 2:05 AM this morning. In total, the Mayor remained outside Tongji University for fifteen hours to mediate the situation. At the same time, the Kanglong Winery near Tongji actually became a temporary joint office for the party, government, and military, and officials gathered there, which was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Students Begin to Act Military and Police Heavily Guarded</h3>
<p>The cause of this incident was that the students' request to amend the new charter of the student union promulgated by the Ministry was not approved a month ago, and their request to withdraw the order to expel two students failed, which led to yesterday's disturbance.</p>
<p>On the eve of the students' plan to go to Beijing to petition, the authorities, in order to avoid the expansion of the situation, sent Police Chief Yu Shuping to the school at 2 AM in the middle of the night to dissuade them, but after talking until 3 AM, the students still insisted on their original proposal.</p>
<p>At about 1 AM yesterday morning, students from various colleges of Tongji began to act, and successively gathered at the Tongji Institute of Technology on Kiangse Road, and the number of people in the school gradually increased to more than 1,000. They planned to go to the North Station at 8 AM to buy tickets and take a train to Beijing to petition. At this time, students from Fudan University, Tongji Affiliated Vocational School, and the Affiliated High School also organized a "farewell group" to send them off. The military and police authorities had already patrolled and guarded the school in advance, cutting off traffic. As a result, the "farewellers" and the "petitioners" could only shout and call out to each other across the wall, and the situation gradually became tense, but the police, in addition to being stationed with sentry posts, did not move.</p>
<p>As the standoff continued until 10:35 AM, the students suddenly fought their way out of an unguarded side door, and the situation became more tense. The military and police immediately formed a line to stop them, with the cavalry in the front and the military and police in the rear. In an instant, they still surrounded the workers outside the school, so although the students rushed out of the school gate, they still failed to break through.</p>
<h3>Mayor Arrives to Persuade</h3>
<p>At this time, the school notified the Mayor by telegram, asking him to mediate. When the Mayor arrived at Kiangse Road in response to the invitation, it was already 10:45 AM. After the Mayor got out of the car, he talked to the students, but the students were noisy and their opinions were different, and the discipline was quite chaotic. The Mayor said that he was very concerned about this incident, but according to the law, only ten representatives were allowed to petition. If the students could legally elect representatives to go to Beijing, he would be very willing to provide protection and assistance. Later, two student representatives asked the Mayor to mediate and order the withdrawal of the military and police. At this point, the situation had originally turned from tense to moderate, but unexpectedly, in the midst of continued negotiations, more than a thousand students from the law school, Guanghua, Daxia, St. John's, Shaoxing High School, Nantong College, Bu Wu, Tongde, China Women's High School, Ai Qun Women's High School, and the Affiliated High School also arrived in succession, holding flags and chanting slogans, with great momentum, which aroused the students of Tongji, and the situation became more arrogant, and shouts rang out again.</p>
<h3>Obtained Student Approval to Form a Five-Person Committee</h3>
<p>At this time, Zhang Yuming, a student from the Department of Political Science, was kicked by a frightened horse. As a result, the students took advantage of this accident and shouted even more fiercely. In the chaotic situation, the military and police took the injured person to the "Kanglong Winery" near Tongji. The Mayor heard the news and went to visit him, and immediately ordered the Army Hospital to treat him. At that time, some students questioned him, and some insulted him. The Mayor immediately went outside to explain: saying that the mistake was not with the police, but because the students were rioting, causing the horse to be frightened. While talking, a large group of students suddenly rushed forward. The Mayor ignored them and immediately issued a warning to the crowd: "If the large group continues to move forward, the representatives of the student union should be responsible for any unfortunate incidents." Upon hearing this, the students eased up slightly. The Mayor continued to comfort them, and promised to mediate and absolutely uphold justice and determine right and wrong. At the same time, he also suggested forming a "five-person committee" to formally conduct mediation. The organization of the five people was that the students would elect one professor and one alumnus, the school would elect one professor and one alumnus, and the Mayor himself would jointly conduct mediation. At that time, the students immediately proposed Professor Yang Lie and alumnus Huang Boqiao. At that time, Tongji President Ding Wenyuan was hosting a reception for alumni and journalists at the Public Training Association to report on the incident. The Mayor sent someone to notify him, asking him to quickly send representatives to participate in the "five-person committee."</p>
<p>As the incident evolved to this point, it seemed to become clearer, and the students were also slightly quieter. The Mayor, seeing that it was past noon and he had not eaten a drop of water, went with the group of journalists present to the nearby "Kanglong Winery" to eat some noodles, and at the same time, he asked the student representatives in detail about the recent results and long-term causes of the student unrest.</p>
<p>As the standoff continued until 3:30 PM, Professor Yang Lie, the professor representative on the student side, reported first, but Huang Boqiao, the alumnus representative who was elected, said that he could not come due to illness. However, the school representative did not report until now. Only President Ding Wenyuan of Tongji had rushed to the City Hall to wait for the representatives to come to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>The Prelude to a Big Chaos Begins Mayor Wu Was Twisted and Kicked The Mayor's Hat, Glasses, and Pipe All Lost</h3>
<p>Just at this moment, there was a commotion in the front team, and the news came that Zhao Renbao, a sophomore from the Law School of Tongji, had been arrested. The Mayor immediately walked out of the winery to investigate, and the prelude to a big chaos began. When the Mayor arrived in front of the students, he heard the students shouting incessantly, some saying that two people had been arrested, and some saying that five or six people had been arrested. After the Mayor questioned the police, they admitted that they had captured one student, who had been sent to the police station. The Mayor immediately ordered his release, but because there was a considerable distance between the police station and the school site, it took time to go back and forth, so after waiting for a while, the students rioted again, and the large group suddenly rushed forward. The students who had been ambushed in the field next to the road had already gathered a lot of broken stones, but after hearing a shout, they saw stones flying all over the sky, falling into the military and police teams and the cavalry. The situation was chaotic for a while, the horses were frightened, and eight police officers were injured on the spot. Even a student surrounded the Mayor, first snatched the hat on his head, and then beat his head with bamboo sticks. At that time, the Mayor still planned to avoid it, but was then pulled by the students with his tie, and then strangled his neck. He fell to the ground and was kicked in the waist and legs. At this time, the Mayor was still afraid that the police officers would not be able to endure it, and still ordered the police officers not to shoot. At this critical moment, a few police officers rushed into the crowd and rescued the Mayor. But at this time, the Mayor had been robbed of his glasses and pipe, which he could not leave his body all day long, and was covered in mud and his hair was disheveled.</p>
<h3>Students Cause Trouble and Retreat to the School</h3>
<p>Although the Mayor was assaulted and humiliated, he maintained a calm attitude throughout, and returned to the winery. At this time, the students knew that they had caused trouble, so they also retreated to the Institute of Technology. However, in the chaos, Gong Shaoxiong, a freshman from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tongji who was serving as a "traffic warden," was captured. He was a 20-year-old from Xiangtan, Hunan. Two reactionary propaganda documents were found in his bag, and he was immediately sent to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Makes a Speech to Reporters in the Winery</h3>
<p>The Mayor made a speech to reporters in the winery, describing his experience of being assaulted and humiliated: "First, the students became impatient and began to shout 'Fight, fight' and then rushed to the police, trying to drive them away. Two of them pressed me down and beat me with bamboo sticks. I was wearing a hat, which was pulled off, and my glasses were also broken. I tried my best to prevent the police from shooting, but they shouted 'Don't let him get up.' After standing up, I immediately ordered them not to riot. If I had not been there in person, there would have been bloodshed. This move was undoubtedly instigated by the Communist bandits, who wanted to use this to create a bloody incident and blame the government. Communist propaganda was found on a student, which can be used as evidence." When asked by reporters if he could identify the murderer, the Mayor replied, "No, I don't have my glasses, I can't see everything clearly."</p>
<p>Soon, alumni Shu Zhendong, Qi Shao, and Jiang Yisheng arrived and reported something. The Mayor then summoned the student representatives again to talk, severely criticizing the students for intentionally creating a bloody incident and attempting to expand the chaos. It was very clear that the Communist bandits were instigating behind the scenes, and they should be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. At this time, Commander Yi also heard the news and rushed to the scene and announced to the crowd: "The students' public insult to the local administrative chief is unprecedented both at home and abroad. I will strictly order them to hand over the list of culprits, otherwise they will be arrested without leniency."</p>
<h3>Military Police Enter Schools, Arrest and Expel Students</h3>
<p>At that time, the mayor reiterated three conditions: 1. Resume classes immediately; 2. Hand over a list of ringleaders; 3. Hand over a list of expelled students. Student representatives returned to the school to convene a meeting to discuss a reply. After a short while, another student representative was seen leading three students claiming to be representatives from Fudan, St. John's, and Jiaotong Universities to meet the mayor, but when asked for their student IDs and what departments they were studying in, they hesitated and were unable to answer. They were then recognized by nearby students as imposters and were detained one by one.</p>
<p>By around 6 o'clock, the night was already dark, and Tongji University President Ding Wenyuan finally made his first appearance on Route Amoy. Presidents of various other universities also arrived one after another, all gathering in the liquor store to discuss solutions. At the same time, Li Ximou, Fang Zhi, Cao Jun, Chen Baotai, and others also rushed to the scene. At that time, no fewer than two or three hundred cars were parked along the roadside.</p>
<p>Thereafter, school officials shuttled between the schools and the liquor store, conveying opinions from both sides, but the students consistently provided no concrete response. Commander Yi then ordered military police to enter the school. Even at this time, university presidents and alumni repeatedly went back and forth to persuade, but with no effect. Some students shouted slogans, while others booed. After half an hour of delay, there were still no results. Commander Yi then ordered all students to be expelled from the auditorium. Unexpectedly, the students all held hands, unwilling to leave. Seeing that there was nothing they could do, the military police began to check student IDs one by one and forcibly separated them by school. In the Tongji group, the military police immediately arrested eleven students on the school's list of expelled students who were identified as leaders of this incident. It was later discovered that the list included a female student, Zhu Wenxiu, who was originally in her third year at Tongji but had suddenly voluntarily dropped back to first year. Her parents had already taken her away before the arrest. In addition, there was a male student, Huang Kelu, who had taken a year off but had suddenly participated again. Mayor Wu ordered that he be arrested as well. At that time, Tao Baichuan, Xie Renjian, Hu Jianzhong, and others also arrived to comfort the mayor and waited for news together at the Kang Long liquor store.</p>
<h3>Perpetrator of the Assault on the Mayor Discovered</h3>
<p>A worker from a certain factory was discovered on the Tongji campus masquerading as a student. It was said that he was also there to participate in this incident. At the same time, a partially incomplete sheet of paper was found near a young man named Zhang who was posing as a Fudan student. The top part of the page seemed to have been torn off, and the bottom part had the following written in pen: "... Strengthen party spirit, discuss the Outline of the Land Law. (2) Work: (A) Strengthen leadership of the Rice Society, resolutely develop it, and make it the core work within the Torch Society. (B) Strengthen education in the Torch Society as a solid foundation." According to investigation reports, no students from Hujiang or Jinda Universities participated, but surprisingly, the school flags of Hujiang and Jinda Universities, as well as the flag of Mayor Ou's Qu Yuping (photographed by this newspaper) were in the procession when the incident occurred. At around 11 o'clock, military police discovered a student named Qu Yuping in the column of Tongde Medical College. He was identified by most people as one of the four students who assaulted Mayor Ou. After being briefly interrogated by the mayor, he was temporarily detained. The mayor repeatedly instructed that he be treated well and not be subjected to retaliation.</p>
<h3>Military Police Who Worked Hard Will Be Commended</h3>
<p>After 12 o'clock, Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, Director Yu, and others moved from the liquor store to a classroom in Tongji University, where they asked President Ding to summon all the class representatives of Tongji University for a lecture. At the same time, Wang Ruihan, commander of the Second Unit of the Police Bureau's Security Corps, and Du Kaixun, squad leader, were summoned. Du, upon seeing the mayor being assaulted by students, was filled with righteous indignation and wanted to personally lead his men to rescue the mayor with guns, but was stopped by Wang Tang's scolding, narrowly averting bloodshed. The mayor expressed his deep gratitude for their sense of justice and loyalty, and indicated that the municipal government would provide special rewards to all personnel who observed discipline and made thorough arrangements. At the same time, the mayor expressed great anger that many middle school students had participated in this incident, and it was heard that he would investigate the middle schools that failed to provide adequate supervision and would impose severe penalties on the principals.</p>
<p>At 1:10 AM this morning, all the class representatives of Tongji University gathered to listen to instructions. The mayor indicated that he was not angry about the incident, but deeply saddened. It was discovered that some students were sent from Tsinghua University in Peiping to participate (the student's name was Chen Mingkang), which proves that the conspiracy behind the scenes to cause bloodshed was obvious. The good students were used by them and blindly acted impulsively, violating faith and justice. The mayor repeatedly explained that to love the country, one must first study and not cause trouble by gathering crowds. Finally, he stated that, apart from those who should be arrested and interrogated according to law in the future, if the other students could provide letters of repentance and accept persuasion, they could resume classes immediately and he would absolutely guarantee their studies and safety. Subsequently, Commander Yi offered conciliatory advice and conveyed to all students that their studies were the most important thing, and that they should peacefully resume classes immediately, and the government would do its best to protect them. Finally, Wu Zhaotang, Director of Secondary Education of the Ministry of Education, and President Ding explained that the Ministry of Education had sent Vice Minister Hang by night train to Shanghai, bringing with him a disbandment order. The authorities would not tolerate any further delay and would immediately dismiss Tongji University.</p>
<h3>Resolved Satisfactorily at 2 AM This Morning</h3>
<p>After much persuasion, the class representatives expressed their willingness to take responsibility for persuading the students to resume classes, and wrote a promissory note for President Ding, which read: "We express our regret for the incident that occurred today and are willing to use our positions as class representatives to do our best to convey and persuade the students in each class to resume classes." It was signed by the class representatives: Huang Weide, Zhou Guangqi, Huang Rulin, Zhang Youzhen, Yin Shijie, He Genwu, Zheng Kangnian, Tao Dingguo, Chen Yinqi, Xue Xue, Lin Shigao, Zhang Lai, Zhang Xu, Ma Renbiao, and others.</p>
<p>President Ding took the promissory note to report to the mayor. Wu believed that a date should be added and personally instructed the class representatives. Initially, they hesitated and were unwilling to take this responsibility, but finally added a parenthetical note after the original text, stating "Resume classes as much as possible starting on the afternoon of the 30th." This student disturbance, which had been delayed for a long time with many twists and turns, was thus resolved. Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, and others left the school and returned to their residences, at 2:05 AM this morning. Students from each school were checked by the schools and led back.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Students from Tongji, St. John's, and Fudan Arrested</h3>
<p>Communist Publications Confiscated on the Spot</p>
<p>In addition, the students arrested yesterday who were identified as ringleaders included: Yu Shaoluo, Chen Wenjian, Zhang Jing'er, Wu Hong, Sun Renyuan, Huang Jingchun, Wang Shaoji, Zhang Zezhi, Su Wo’heng, Zhao Renbao, Zhang Hongnian from Tongji; Wang Zhenhe and Tang Xingbo from St. John's; and Bin Kehong from Fudan, totaling fourteen students.

Two magazines issued by the Communist Party in Hong Kong, "Welcoming the New Year" (Issue 49) and "European Travel Notes" (Issue 50), were found on his person. He was sent to the Garrison Headquarters for further investigation, and the rest were handed over to the Police Headquarters for detention.</p>

<h3>Second Round of Rationed Cooking Oil for Each District, Unsold from Previous Years, Expected to Be Available Soon; 12 Liang for 15,000 Yuan Regardless of Type</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee held its tenth meeting yesterday morning. The agenda items were as follows: 1. The second round of comprehensive cooking oil rationing will be sold at a price of 15,000 yuan for 12 liang, regardless of the type of oil. The deficit will be submitted to the central government for subsidies. Oil purchase certificates will be distributed to each district starting today, and it is expected that the oil will be rationed before the end of the old year. 2. The remaining 1,403 dan and 76 jin of oil from the first round of rationing, which are currently stored in various retail stores, will be included in the second round of ration quotas.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Ration Price to Be Adjusted</h3>
<p>3.  Due to insufficient supply of coal balls for workers in the second round of rationing, it was temporarily impossible to begin. Now, 100,000 dan have been produced and delivered to the meeting. All labor unions that have applied for wage calculation based on the cost of living index within the specified period will begin to be verified and allocated. 4. The price of food rice allocated by the Allocation Committee has not been changed since it was approved in June of last year. It was originally calculated at 60% of the market price at the time of issuance, with Burmese rice at 240,000 yuan per shi and broken rice at 168,000 yuan per shi. The current allocation price differs too much from the market price and will be adjusted starting this January, calculated at 60% of the market price for that month.</p>

<h3>Extradition of Xu Jizhuang Problematic; Hong Kong Authorities Allow Bail Release; Our Lawyer Strives Without Success, Continued Hearing Scheduled for Next Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by our Hong Kong correspondent on the 29th] Regarding the extradition of former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, Xu Jizhuang, after his arrest, the Hong Kong Central Court heard opinions from all parties this morning. The judge allowed Xu Jizhuang to be released on bail after paying a cash deposit of HK$1 million, and a continued hearing will be held in one week. The amount of the bail deposit has broken records. The lawyer representing our government, Xian Bingxi, strongly opposed it in court, arguing that Xu might flee to Saigon or Macau, but to no avail. Xu was ultimately released on bail and smiled. Xu's concubine, Wang Baimei, looked troubled upon hearing that the bail was HK$1 million and is currently raising the funds. She carried an English novel, "A Tale of Two Cities," intending to give it to Xu, but was unsuccessful. Xu wore a gray suit today and looked haggard. The hearing lasted approximately 20 minutes, and Xu's defense lawyer, Marcus Da Silva, argued fiercely with our lawyer, Xian. It is rumored that Xue will receive HK$20,000 in public funds this time. After the adjournment, Xue Erwa stated that it was still questionable whether Xu Jizhuang could raise the huge sum of bail money.</p>

<h3>Accused of Election Fraud, Old Zhabei District Head Defends Against False Accusations and Denies Claims of Lard-Mixed Paste</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Guozhang, an assistant in the Old Zhabei District Office, witnessed instances of fraud during the recent Legislative Yuan election and yesterday filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against the district head of the district, Li Ruchun, and the head of the civil affairs department, Yu Qingjia, for election fraud. The District Prosecutor's Office opened a court investigation yesterday morning, with plaintiff Chen Guozhang, defendants Li Ruchun and Yu Qingjia, and related parties Deputy District Head Wang Chenghiong and election supervisor Ren Bozhang present.</p>
<p>According to Chen, the Old Zhabei District had a voting population of just over 10,000 people, but more than 50,000 ballots were cast. He also claimed that lard-mixed paste was used to reduce the stickiness of the seals on the ballot boxes, which were then sent to the district office where the seals were removed and ballots were inserted. The next morning, the seals were re-sealed, resulting in a surge in ballots. Li and others vehemently denied the accusations, stating that the district had more than 80,000 residents and only 50,000 people voted, which was far from the actual numbers. The claim of lard-mixed paste was completely false. After the interrogation, the court ruled that Li Ruchun should be released on bail, which was paid on the spot by Deputy District Head Wang Chenghiong, while the others were ordered to return.</p>

<h3>Tenants Discuss Effective Countermeasures as Rent Is Calculated Based on Index</h3>
<p>Recently, some companies and stores on Nanjing Road who continue to lease properties from the British company, Hardoon Limited, have received notices indicating that starting from the month of contract signing, monthly rent must use the monthly rent in the 26th year as a base and increase monthly according to one-fifth (for those without subletting) or one-quarter (for those with subletting) of the workers' cost of living index. Upon receiving these notices, the first month's rent was found to have increased by a staggering 13,640 to 17,050 times the previous monthly rent, causing alarm. After investigation, the Civil Code regarding leasing, Chapter 3 of the Land Law regarding housing and land rental, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Provisional Measures for Housing Rental Management, and the Housing Rental Regulations promulgated by the National Government on December 1, 1936, all have strict regulations regarding the increase or decrease of rent, and landlords must not arbitrarily exceed the scope of the law. It is reported that the companies and stores believe that Hardoon Limited's demand disregards our country's laws and is inconsistent with the general practice of adjusting rent.

<h3>Coal Briquette Retail Price at 300,000 per Load: Social Affairs Bureau Decides to Adopt Negotiated Price System for Market Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau believes it is inappropriate for coal briquette merchants to arbitrarily adjust market prices, turning defeat into victory.  It has decided to adopt a negotiated price system. The Social Affairs Bureau will provide a program to automatically calculate coal briquette price lists. If the prices of raw materials and labor listed therein change, coal merchants can adjust the price according to the program and implement it after reporting to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval.</p>
<p>The Price Evaluation Committee's Fuel Subcommittee held its 18th evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. It initially reviewed the selling price of coal briquettes and decided that the coal briquette factory price for self-pickup is 5.2 million per ton, and the retail price is 300,000 per load, effective immediately.</p>
<p>The meeting also approved the automatic adjustment calculation program for coal briquette price lists provided by the Social Affairs Bureau. The base price of coal briquettes for factory pickup will be discussed at the next meeting. In addition, regarding the third phase of industrial worker coal briquette production and distribution, it was decided to hold a meeting to design and implement the plan after the Fuel Management Committee's raw materials arrive.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Elite Fifth Army</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Kaifeng, 22nd] This time, in order to relieve Liu Bocheng, who was besieged by the National Army in the Dabie Mountains and was in imminent danger, the bandit leader Chen Yi, taking advantage of the National Army's weak forces in Henan, personally led a force of 100,000 to infiltrate Tongxu, Chenliu, Weishi, and Zhuxianzhen from the area north of Minquan and east of Qixian last month, forming a fan-shaped encirclement around Kaifeng. He attempted to seize the key military strongholds of Bian and Zheng, which the National Army would never abandon, without any effort. Even if he could not succeed, the pressure on the Dabie Mountains could be reduced. If he succeeded by chance, the overall situation in the Central Plains would be completely changed. This conspiracy, like a violent storm, began to attack this sandy city on the afternoon of December 12th. At that time, Bian was indeed very empty, and the military strength was frighteningly weak. As a result, there were rumors and alarms, and several scares in one night. Then, Lanfeng, Luowang, and Xinglong in eastern Bian, and Shanmou, Shaogang, and Xinghuaying in western Bian, all fell into the hands of the bandits. All external transportation and communications were completely cut off. Although the National Army's strong forces had been stationed in the city walls since the afternoon of the 13th, strengthening the city's defenses, the spies had already infiltrated outside the embankment, and the sound of cannons was deafening, and the situation was extremely critical. At this time, hundreds of thousands of citizens of Bian, under the common fear of death, mobilized to assist the National Army in strengthening the city's defenses, while silently praying for the arrival of the chasing troops day and night. "The new Fifth Army, which is stabilizing the Central Plains, is advancing westward from Zhecheng."</p>
<p>This news, like a spring breeze, rippled through the frozen sandy city, rippling in the trembling hearts of hundreds of thousands of citizens. However, "only the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one coming down!" One day, two days passed, and this spring breeze was still frozen by the cold current. Hundreds of thousands of gentry and people were still immersed in the abyss of terror. The new Fifth Army, this powerful mechanized unit, famous internationally and most feared by the Communists, had no news at all. The sandy city became a dead city, and a cloud of terror shrouded the sky above this sandy city.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the afternoon of the 17th, the Communists outside Kaifeng stopped their attacks and fled south in droves. This historic city had a "scare but no injury." What was going on? Some said that this was due to the prestige of the city defense forces, resulting in the "Jiang Taigong is here, all gods retreat" effect. Some said that the bandits were feinting to the east and attacking the west, and seeing that Bian and Zheng were difficult to capture, they had fled to various strongholds along the Pinghan Railway and had already gained considerable advantages, so they abandoned Bian and Zheng and fled southeast. Both of the above statements are not without reason, but the most important thing is that the Fifth Army was pressing down on their backs with the force of a thunderbolt, digging out their heart and lungs (eliminating their most elite Sixth and Eighth Columns in the Suiqi area during the westward advance), making them panic-stricken and afraid to linger in the Bian-Zheng-Xu triangle area, and hastily retreating south.</p>
<h3>Lonely Wilderness, Tanks Galloping</h3>
<p>The warm sunshine shone again on this windy and sandy city, and the heavy cloud of terror that was pressing on the hearts of every citizen also dissipated. Laughter was once again on the faces of every citizen, and the sound of comforting the troops resounded throughout the city. The soldiers defending the city, with their firm and persistent defense in the frozen wilderness, earned the heartfelt respect and gratitude of the citizens. Everyone slaughtered pigs and cattle to慰勞 them, and they deserved it.</p>
<p>The Fifth Army, which directly relieved the siege of Kaifeng, was far away in the bandit area, hundreds of miles away. All sectors of Bian were anxiously unable to go to 　勞. Fortunately, Deputy Adjutant Liu of the Fifth Army led a batch of tanks and more than a hundred trucks to Bian on the 20th to collect supplies. He often invited me to go and see them together. I was also happy to visit this elite army that I had long heard of. So, after Deputy Adjutant Liu left, Chairman Liu telegraphed Director Wu of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Speaker Liu of the Provincial Assembly, and telegraphed Commissioner Qi of the Provincial Government to ask him to represent Chairman Liu to go to the Provincial Government to gather and comfort the new Fifth Army. At 12:30, I, Director Yan, Commissioner Qi, Speaker Liu representing Councilor Kong, and Director Yuan Maoju of the Security Department, etc., five people, carrying three hundred million banknotes, took two jeeps, led by a large tank sent by Deputy Adjutant Liu in front, and four armed trucks in the rear, left the sandy city and set off for a certain place northwest of Qixian, east of Chenliu and Tongxu.</p>
<p>Along the way, there were still Communists wandering around the day before. Although we were wary, we did not hesitate. However, seeing the field fortifications everywhere, we could not help but be shocked. Most of the villages, large and small, were deserted, and the broken houses and thatched huts had no doors or windows. The desolate scene after the war cannot be described by those who have not experienced it personally. The tanks, like fierce tigers, galloped across the lonely wilderness in the setting sun, further showing that the atmosphere of war still shrouded this land. There were trenches and obstacles everywhere, but the tanks ignored everything and flattened them all. Seeing that there was no way to go, the tanks naturally made a road wherever they went, charging left and right, opening roads through mountains and making bridges over water. In this way, we were led by the tanks through deserted villages and wilderness, deep into the old nest of the Communists yesterday. At about 5:30 in the afternoon, we jumped out of the car, brushed off the dust, and shouldered the enthusiasm of hundreds of thousands of people, and entered the village we were going to.</p>
<h3>Recognizing Heroes in Desolate Village Huts</h3>
<p>This is a very small and extremely desolate village, and in this small village lives the headquarters of the famous Fifth Army, and General Qiu Qingquan, whom we have long admired and have no chance to meet. Speaking of the Fifth Army (commonly known as the New Fifth Army), this is an internationally famous unit with a glorious history. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was the 200th Division, with the best equipment, the best training, and the best combat effectiveness. At that time, they were sent as the Expeditionary Force. In the Indian-Burmese theater, they fought alongside the Allies many times, and their fame shook the world from then on. Their glorious achievements are everywhere on the battlefields of India and Burma. After the restoration, they were transferred from the southwest to the capital. Soon, they were transferred to the east to suppress the　. At that time, the Communists were arrogant and did not take them seriously at all. However, the Communists' attitude of　 contempt for everything was well taught by the Fifth Army this time. They no longer dared to underestimate the Fifth Army, and even felt a little fear in their hearts. From then on, the Fifth Army pointed its spears north and has been suppressing the Communists in the border areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu. There has never been a record of defeat in their battle history. Now, the Communists have openly discussed the topic of "how to eliminate the fragile psychology of fearing the Fifth Army" in every small group discussion. General Qiu Qingquan, who leads the Fifth Army, is even more of a　　　famous general, a top student of the　　second term of the military academy, and a graduate of the German Army University. He can write poetry, songs, and fu, and he can repel enemies thousands of miles away. He can kill bandits on horseback and write memorials when he dismounts. General Qiu is indeed a rare talent among modern soldiers. This unit, full of glory, and this dazzling victorious general live in this desolate 　deserted little village, and we can immediately put it in, which is indeed a very happy thing.</p>
<p>The village　 everywhere are tanks and ammunition. The engines of countless trucks are roaring like a great wind. The war horses are also constantly neighing. There is no sense of terror here, only a sense of tension and excitement. Deputy Adjutant Liu led us into a dilapidated and dirty small courtyard. There are only three small thatched huts in this courtyard. There are no doors on the doors, and each hangs a military blanket. The windows are blocked with cattail mats. In the midst of the noise, the door curtain of the east room was opened, and a thick smoke of burning firewood poured out, followed by a military officer who was not tall, not handsome, in his forties, wearing a yellow cotton uniform. Through Deputy Adjutant Liu's introduction, we learned that he was Commander Qiu, whom we had long admired. This general, this internationally renowned general, not only did not have a chest full of medals, but was as sincere and approachable as a common soldier. He was very grateful for our enthusiasm. He treated us as warmly as a countryman would treat distinguished guests. He was obviously very flustered. The room was full of thick smoke, and a few bricks formed a stove, with a few pieces of firewood burning. There were no seats and no tables. He apologized that the place was very sorry for the guests. But when we saw this famous general, who was working hard for the country, living such a hard life in this severe cold, we felt that he was more respectable and lovable. With the most sincere attitude, everyone represented the enthusiasm of all sectors of Bian, expressing their condolences and gratitude to him and all the soldiers. He was very grateful, offering smoke and tea, and was busy with joy.</p>
<p>In gratitude, he reported to everyone the course of the great victory on the way west from Henan: He said, "This army was originally ordered by the highest authorities to go to the Shenqiu-Xiangcheng-Xincai area to complete another task. However, after receiving the order, we immediately detected that Chen Yi's bandit troops had an attempt to invade Bian and Zheng. We immediately telegraphed the superiors to report the new situation and resolutely took action, directly advancing westward from Yongcheng via Bozhou, Luyi, and Zhecheng. This is because Bian and Zheng are the political and military centers of the Central Plains and must not be lost. Moreover, the Communists have always avoided fighting this army. This westward advance will not only relieve the siege of Bian and Zheng, but also find their main force and fight a happy battle. Chen Yi happened to discover that we were advancing westward at full speed, so he sent his most elite Sixth and Eighth and First-Class Columns to stop us in turn. When a part of our army advanced to Baimiao, Hedi, and Cen, south of Qian County, we came into contact with their Sixth Column. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Sixth Column was completely defeated, and only a few remnants fled southeast. After the Sixth Column suffered a disastrous defeat, the Eighth Column came up. This was an unprecedentedly tragic war. As a result, the Eighth Column also suffered the same fate as the Sixth Column in the same area, and the remnants fled north of Minquan. Finally, they even brought up the Eleventh Column, which was vulnerable to a single blow. In just one night, they completely collapsed. In total, they suffered more than 20,000 casualties this time. Their 18th Division Commander was also killed, and more than 2,000 were captured. The weapons and horses are still being inventoried. We also suffered more than 500 casualties, and even company commanders and tank platoon leaders were killed or wounded. But in the final analysis, we got too much cheap. A few days ago, the highest standing committee issued an order, believing that our change of plan this time had quickly relieved the siege of Bian and Zheng and that the disposal was very appropriate. There are no bandit traces within dozens of miles nearby. We moved into this place yesterday. Although the bandits between Bian and Zheng fled because they felt threatened, we still cannot relax our guard. As long as there is no loophole to exploit, we will definitely kill all these mice." General Qiu reported the course of the battle with a flourish of gestures and a majestic momentum. After the report, it was already late. Although the host had the intention of keeping guests, the guests knew that the host had unspeakable difficulties. Everyone stood up to say goodbye, and I really felt a little reluctant. Seeing this situation, General Qiu wanted to talk to me again, and perhaps felt that keeping one guest to sleep over might not be a problem, so he insisted on keeping me for one night. The four people who came with me also hoped that I would stay overnight to discuss the unfulfilled intentions of everyone, and to collect more of their heroic and moving deeds. I was also happy to do so. So, in the twilight, they were protected by tanks and left in a puff of smoke. (Reporter Wang Shoumei)</p>

<h3>Li Xuelu's Tragic Case Opens Trial Yesterday, Accusers Kowtow to Seek Justice</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Jintan, 29th] In the case of the murder of Vice Speaker Li Xuelu of Jintan, the District Court ordered bailiff Hu Yuanqing to take the defendant Yuan Wenbin's wife, Yuan Wu, to the Zhixi Bridge Tianliang Office and Yuan's father-in-law Wu Kun's home on the 22nd to search for 23 important letters related to the case. At 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, Judge Fang Xianjie still served as the presiding judge and opened the court to investigate and try the case. The audience was very crowded. All the original defendants appeared in court on time to answer questions. The accuser, Li Zhirui, was the deceased's great-uncle and grandfather, and he cried bitterly and kowtowed in court, begging for justice for the deceased. Defendant Yuan Wenbin submitted to the court a letter from Yuan from the detention center to his wife, asking her to collude and frame the others. After reading it, Yuan admitted that he had written it himself. Next, defendants Luo Jiannong, Yuan Xiping, Chang Guoying, and Jing Demao were brought up for interrogation one by one, and the letters between each person and Yuan were reviewed separately. Because the language in the letters was secretive and contained many secret codes, the defendants still stubbornly denied and argued that they had nothing to do with the case. The trial of the entire case lasted for four hours, and the facts of the case have gradually become clear. The court ordered a retrial at a later date. The defendants' request for bail was denied and they were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Western Night Tales: A New Utopia Discovered in Hezhou County, Gansu</h3>
<p>[Airmail from Lanzhou, 24th] A Utopia discovered in Hezhou County, Gansu. It turns out that there was an "Old Rent" in the Chengguan Town of the county, which was under the jurisdiction of the Han Tusi during the Qing Dynasty. Since the government changed the indigenous leadership and appointed Han Chinese officials, the area has been under the jurisdiction of Qinghai Province (because the Han Tusi was under the jurisdiction of Xunhua, Qinghai during the Qing Dynasty, so it should also be under the jurisdiction of Qinghai Province after the change of leadership). Later, in order to delineate the boundaries, the Qinghai Provincial Government exchanged it with the Xixiang of Linxia with the Gansu Provincial Government. Xixiang of Linxia was under the jurisdiction of Qinghai Province, but the authorities in Gansu Province did not manage the "Old Rent" of Hezhou. From the victory of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, the people in this area have never fulfilled any national obligations such as paying taxes or serving in the military, just like living in a Utopia.</p>
<p>Yongchang County, Gansu, suffered a severe drought and freezing disaster in the summer and autumn of last year, and the crops failed to produce any harvest. Most farmers sold their family property to make a living. After the severe winter arrived, they had nothing left to sell. The old and young went out together to flee to Ningxia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places. Ten days ago, two families of more than ten people each from Wulong Township wanted to cross the Qiyun Mountains to Qinghai to find food. When they reached a place called Xuetaiban, they encountered heavy snow and biting north winds. These more than twenty people all died on the way due to hunger and cold. Later, they were discovered by travelers. Dozens of bodies were hugging each other, stiff and pressed under the accumulated snow, a very tragic sight. It is also heard that the county government of the county believes that the disaster is too severe and it is difficult to collect public food taxes. It only collected about half of the taxes. In order to achieve the assessment of the superiors, the person in charge of the Tianliang Office of the county recently 　大此員　, so-called "Sweeping Collection Team," to go to various townships to collect taxes. Farmers who cannot pay taxes are also included in the collection of cattle, sheep, and horses.</p>
<p>Taoist Li Xingwu, 37 years old, from Wuwei, Gansu, is engaged in bone reading and fortune-telling in Lanzhou. In December last year, Chai Junyu, the wife of a citizen of the city, Cheng Wanzhong, went to Li Laodao's place for bone reading. Chai was naturally frivolous and Li was also an experienced philanderer. They hit it off immediately and had a secret meeting at No. 24 Zuogong West Road on December 7 last year. They were caught by the police station, who confiscated their hats, belts, and pants. Li Laodao was released on bail. After Cheng learned of this, he divorced Chai Junwang. Li Laodao actually kept her in a golden house and forgot to return. The matter was discovered by a reporter from the Northwest Daily and recorded. Li believed that this news was provided by Chai's ex-husband Cheng Wanzhong, obviously wanting to damage his reputation, so he sued the Gaolan Local Court. The local court held a public trial on the 19th of this month, and the audience was packed. This case is scheduled to be sentenced on the 23rd.</p>
<p>The climate in Minle County, Gansu, is extremely cold this winter, the most severe in the entire province. However, since New Year's Day this year, the climate has suddenly turned warm, with a spring-like scene. The grass in the sunny places near the county government is green, about an inch long. It is a truly rare thing to find green grass in the depths of winter, something that has not been seen in decades. (Reporter Song Lin)</p>
<h3>Taiwan Exposition Under Preparation</h3>
<p>[Airmail from Taipei, 26th] The various industrial, mining, agricultural, and forestry production institutions here have been working hard to prepare for the "Taiwan Exposition" to be held in Nanjing on April 1st. The association will display all the production exhibits of this province and is limited to concentrating them in Keelung before March 1st and transporting them to Shanghai for transfer to Beijing. The exposition venue has also been decided to be built by an engineering company. It is said that they are prefabricated houses, which may be sold in separate buildings in the future to solve the housing shortage for civil servants in the capital.</p>
<h3>Completing the Transportation Network in Eastern Sichuan, Sichuan Provincial Government Rushes to Repair Roads</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Chengdu, 24th] The Sichuan Provincial Government is urgently implementing an emergency telegram from the Central Government. In order to defend Sichuan and prevent the Communists from fleeing west, the eight counties near Bamian Mountain, including Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang, Pengshui, Zhongxian, Fengdu, Fuling, and Shizhu, are designated as defense areas. According to Dai Xubai, Director of the Sichuan Highway Bureau, told reporters: The Provincial Government has decided to rush to repair the transportation network in the area. This month, three lines will be completed: the ring road connecting Wulong, Fuling, Dianjiang, and Liangshan to the Sichuan-Hunan Highway; a new road will be built from Fengdu to Shizhu; and the You-Xiu-Qian-Peng highway network will be reorganized. The funds will be transferred from the first batch of grain funds returned to Sichuan by the Central Government, amounting to 100 billion. The Daba Mountain National Defense Highway Engineering Team has arrived in the county and has officially started work.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Robbers Arrested in Xihu Bridge, Changsha</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Changsha, 29th] On the evening of the 27th, more than 100 robbers committed robbery at Xihu Bridge. All of them have been arrested, with no one escaping. On the 28th, more than 100 merchants in Hexi Street, Daxi Gate, held basins and wooden buckets and forcibly sold government-priced rice to various rice shops. The rice shops could not sell government-priced rice, and the situation was tense for a while. The military police arrived to suppress the situation, and each person was allowed to buy one or two pints before the matter subsided.</p>
<h3>Mr. Cazanave, Consultant of Sichuan-Xikang Project, Talks about Construction</h3>
<p>[Airmail from Chongqing, 26th] The French have always been interested in Sichuan's economic construction. Although Mr. Feyeux, the representative of the Far East Economic Delegation stationed in Chongqing and the engineer of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, was recalled to his country because the signing of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was far away, Mr. Cazanave, who has been living in Chengdu for more than two years, still talks about the Sino-French cooperation in developing Sichuan's resources with great interest and without any discouragement.</p>
<p>Mr. Cazanave is the representative of the Far East Economic Delegation stationed in Chengdu. After Mr. Feyeux left Chongqing, he took over all the work and often traveled between Chengdu and Chongqing. This short Parisian is a water conservancy and irrigation expert and has a deep friendship with Sichuan Chairman Deng Xihou and Xikang Chairman Liu Wenhui. Therefore, his Chinese business card has a line that he considers to be quite honorable: Engineering Consultant of the Sichuan and Xikang Provincial Governments.</p>
<p>First, he told our reporter: "Of course, the French are most concerned about the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, because all construction investments are completely based on the 　 先　condition of convenient transportation.　 Yes, the delay in signing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway cannot affect other aspects of the project.</p>
<p>According to our reporter, French economists are very concerned about the salt industry in Zigong. Mr. Cazanave has visited Zigong 　察 several times and signed a 　之步 contract with Sichuan Salt Company. In February last year, the French government 　意 hired Professor Porlni to come to Sichuan for investigation. Professor Porlni is a famous geologist and petroleum expert in France, in his fifties, and currently teaches at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. It is reported that the report is still being compiled.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked him: "Mr. Cazanave, since you are the engineering consultant of Sichuan and Xikang provinces, can you tell us what suggestions you have for Chairmen Deng and Liu?"</p>
<p>He replied very frankly: Sixty kilometers upstream from Guanxian County is Xingwanping. According to his months of investigation, it is suitable for building a 100,000-horsepower power plant. He has written a report as thick as three inches and sent it to Deng Xihou for reference. It is reported that the Sichuan Provincial Government is rushing to translate it, and it will be sent to the Resources Committee for consultation as soon as it is translated.</p>
<p>Mr. Cazanave's 　足跡遍踏 Sichuan and Xikang provinces. He is also a traveler. The only thing he feels at 　安　 is: his suggestion to Chairman Liu Wenhui to build a power plant on the Kangding River is now beginning to take shape.</p>
<p>The Kangding River is twenty-five kilometers long, and the water flows from Gaoyan 충 to the bottom, totaling one thousand meters, which is indeed the most ideal place to build a power plant. Liu Wenhui has accepted Mr. Cazanave's　 whole 　 opinion: building three plants along the Kangding River, each with 50,000 horsepower, 300 meters apart. According to reports, Liu has sent the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government to Beijing to ask for instructions. If the negotiation fails, Liu will decide to invest privately.</p>
<p>After Mr. Mu, the head of the Far East Economic Delegation, returned to Shanghai from the Philippines, he went to Beijing a few days ago to discuss with Chen Qitian, Minister of Economic Affairs. The content is confidential. Our reporter got a clue from Mr. Cazanave's casual conversation. Mr. Cazanave 　 said: Both the Chinese and French governments do not have a large amount of US dollars. Instead of using US dollars to 　calculate Sino-French　's foreign raw material loans, it is more convenient to exchange goods directly. If the Mu-Chen talks are successful this time, there is a glimmer of hope for the signing of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. (Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Ningxia and Eastern Gansu</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Lanzhou 13th Dispatch] Mr. Deng Chungao, the Supervising Commissioner of Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai, has recently inspected Qinghai, Hexi, Ningxia, and eastern Gansu in the past six months. He traveled tirelessly and without rest. After returning to Lanzhou, he met with reporters. In a very short time, the reporter asked him to express his observations on Ningxia and eastern Gansu.</p>
<p>He first talked about the provincial administration of Ningxia, believing that Ningxia's provincial administration has indeed made considerable progress. For example, household registration is the most difficult to manage well, but in Ningxia, the investigation, registration, and changes of the population, combined with a sound police system, have made the local public security very peaceful. Without an "identification card," it can be said that it is difficult to move an inch, and the communists have no opportunity to operate. Although Ningxia cannot compare with Gansu and Qinghai provinces, it is moving towards an ideal state day by day. The general public's knowledge level is also gradually improving. All counties have established county central elementary schools. Mongolian children in Alxa League's Dingyuanying are receiving compulsory education. In fact, these Mongolian compatriots, in addition to devoutly worshiping religion and sending their children to temples to become lamas, are rarely willing to send their children to study Chinese books. It is necessary to force them. Darhan Wang (i.e., Darizhaya) has made great efforts in popularizing education.</p>
<p>Ningxia's canals are crisscrossed, and its water conservancy projects are no less than those of Shaanxi in the northwest provinces. The harvest has been very good in recent years, and it can achieve the ideal of "sufficient food." Only two counties have suffered poor harvests due to waterlogging and drought, but the authorities have already handled relief matters. Ningxia has widely planted trees, and its achievements are also improving rapidly. Regarding the pacification zone in eastern Gansu, he said that a month ago it was already</p>
<p>Peaceful and Quiet: Only Huanxian still has a small number of communists lurking. The 82nd Division of the National Army is stationed in this area, with sufficient military strength and strict discipline. Commander Ma Yuan, who is stationed in Xifengzhen, in addition to military preparedness, also pays attention to assisting local education, construction, and comforting refugees, so he is enthusiastically supported by the local people. The rear hospitals in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, and the rear hospitals in Pingliang's Xifengzhen are relatively well-equipped. Recently, due to the smooth progress of the war, there are not many wounded soldiers in each hospital. Regarding the</p>
<p>Relief Work in Eastern Gansu: In addition to the central government allocating 300 million yuan in emergency relief funds to Qingyang, Heshui, and other six counties, the Gansu Provincial Government also raised more than 100 million yuan, plus more than 80 shi of yellow millet (grain) to handle emergency relief. The recent work relief projects in various counties utilize those among the refugees who have the ability to work, using work relief methods to repair the Qing (yang) Huan (xian), Qing (yang), and He (shui) highways in order to facilitate military transportation and reduce the burden on the people invisibly. The Gansu Provincial Government's proposed reconstruction plan for the Eastern Gansu Pacification Zone has great hope for the region if it can be promoted step by step.</p>
<p>After Deng finished talking about the situation in these two places, he comprehensively expressed his</p>
<p>Inspection Feelings: He believes that the official governance of our country has not yet reached a completely clear stage, and the task of the supervising commissioner is still quite important. The mission of supervision, in addition to passively eliminating corruption and malfeasance, should also strive to improve the service spirit and morality of public officials in order to increase administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Supervising Commissioner Deng is from Xunhua, Qinghai, and</p>
<p>Serving His Hometown is his ambition. He is of medium build, with solid muscles, does not smile easily, and is awe-inspiring. In the past, he once headed the highest academic institution in the Northwest—Gansu College—and his students are all over the Northwest. He often said to people: "To eliminate corruption and reduce the absorption of local people's blood and sweat, and use it for the construction of the Great Northwest, is my lifelong wish."

<h3>Impressions of a Trip to Taiwan: The Equipment of All Levels of Schools Meets Standards</h3>
<p>In recent months, articles about Taiwan have appeared frequently in newspapers, such as news reports and travelogues, because everyone has high hopes and ardent feelings for this precious island that has rejoined the motherland after its recovery. After all, Taiwan is a territory of China, and its people are descendants of the Yellow Emperor. However, it was controlled by Japanese invaders for half a century, and everything was disconnected from the motherland. After the recovery, to fully restore it to its Chinese identity is equivalent to undergoing a major revolution. The most important and first step that should be taken is a thorough reform of the education system. The highest administrative authorities in Taiwan Province are now painstakingly exerting their full efforts in this regard. Many people from other provinces who visit Taiwan also focus on education. Therefore, the "Taiwan Education Visit Group" organized by Shanghai education circles has emerged one after another, and the National Elementary School Principals' Visit Group led by Director Zhu Junti of the National Education Department of the Shanghai Education Bureau was the first, with a larger number of people, a longer visit time, a wider range of areas visited, and a more enthusiastic welcome and hospitality from the people of Taiwan.</p>
<p>I am also a member of this first visit group. Our trip to Taiwan was from December 3rd to 18th last year. The first place we landed in Taiwan was Keelung; we went south to Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan; from Tainan we continued south to Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and even the southernmost point, Eluanbi Lighthouse, facing the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan's administrative divisions are divided into nine cities and eight counties: Keelung City, Taipei City, Hsinchu City, Taichung City, Chiayi City, Changhua City, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung City, and Taipei County, Hsinchu County, Taichung County, Tainan County, Kaohsiung County, Taitung County, Hualien County, and Penghu County. Taipei and Kaohsiung are the largest cities, while the other cities are smaller than the counties in terms of administration.</p>
<p>We visited along the way without resting. Although the days were short, the journey was too long, so it was as tense as a military march. In total, we visited Taiwan's three highest institutions of learning—Taiwan University, Taipei Institute of Technology, and Tainan Institute of Technology—as well as middle schools, normal schools, national schools, and kindergartens in various cities and counties. Visiting national schools was our profession, so we visited the most of them. The equipment of schools at all levels meets standards. But these are all legacies of the Japanese. Although we are entitled to this legacy, the atmosphere of the Japanese colonial era, the good ones should be preserved, while those that violate reason have gradually been eliminated.</p>
<p>In addition to visiting, we also toured several scenic spots. Regarding the various spots of scenic interest, someone has already published articles in the newspaper in the past, so I will not repeat them. What I know now, regarding the personnel issues in Taiwan Province, or may be of more interest to readers, so I will briefly describe it: During the Japanese rule in Taiwan, some Taiwanese were fortunate enough to enter the mainland and were not oppressed by the Japanese. They avoided mentioning their provincial origin and mostly claimed to be Fujianese. Originally, when Taiwan was incorporated into the Qing Dynasty after Zheng Chenggong's death, it belonged to Fujian Province. Fujian and Taiwan are separated by a strip of water and have similar pronunciations, so Taiwanese and Fujianese can be said to be one family. After the recovery of Taiwan Province, the Administrative Governor's Office was established, with various departments under it, to handle all administrative affairs. After the "February 28th Incident," General Bai Chongxi personally went to Taiwan to quell the chaos, and then Taiwan was changed to a province. In response to the demands of the Taiwanese people, Taiwanese were given priority in the selection of department heads. Therefore, Taiwanese who had some qualifications and status in political and academic circles in the mainland, who usually claimed to be Fujianese, all restored their original provincial origin and were able to return to their hometowns and serve their communities.</p>

<h3>In Surging Waves and Terrifying Tides: Ta Kung Over YMCA</h3>
<p>52 to 47, Hualian Significantly Defeats American Military Police</p>
<p>[Our News] Hualian and Ta Kung, two basketball powerhouses in the A-League, both played last night, creating a rare grand event. The city's gymnasium was packed, sweeping away the cold atmosphere of the past few days. As a result, Hualian's army thoroughly defeated the American military police, 105 to 40. In the first half, the score was 50 to 15, and the American military police were no match. Ta Kung, against the YMCA, went through a bitter battle. In an extremely tense situation, they defeated the YMCA by a score of 52 to 47. In the first half, Ta Kung led by four baskets, 30 to 22. In another A-League 2 game, Tongren defeated Dahua, 44 to 34. In the first half, Dahua led by one point, 17 to 16. The situation of each game is as follows:</p>
<p>The Tense Battle Was Unexpected</p>
<p>The final game between Ta Kung and YMCA was the most eye-catching. The tension of the battle was unexpected. In the first half, the YMCA took an 8-5 lead, then tied at 10 points and 20 points each. The score fluctuated, and Ta Kung led by eight points in the first half, 30 to 22. In the second half, Ta Kung led all the way, consistently leading by three, four, six or seven points. The YMCA chased closely, and the situation was quite dangerous. Ta Kung finally overcame the crisis and won 52 to 47. The YMCA used man-to-man defense, and the defense was very tight, making it impossible for Ta Kung to perform. As a result, both sides committed a large number of fouls, totaling 46 times. Five players were fouled out, namely Cai Wenzhang, Cai Wenhua, Tu Wenlong, Ma Han, and V. Kailoski, which shows the intensity of the competition. Ta Kung was trapped in a bitter battle in this tight situation, and it was difficult to break through. This is a sign that the connection is not yet fully skilled. The team's offense was not smooth enough, which was a major reason for the dangerous situation last night. With the first decisive battle against Hualian coming soon, Ta Kung should be prepared.</p>
<p>Five Players Were Fouled Out</p>
<p>The referees were Zheng Zhifang and Xuan Hegao. Cai Zhongqiang scored the first point, and Wenhua scored a point from a free throw. Wenzhang scored, and Ta Kung led 5-0. The YMCA counterattacked and took an 8-5 lead. Wenzhang and Wenhua worked hard, and then tied at 10 each. The difference between the two sides was often between one or two points. At 20-18, Ta Kung substituted players. Huang Bailing shot into the air, and the score was tied again at 20 each. At the end of the first half, Ta Kung led by four baskets, 30 to 22. After the break, the YMCA's counterattack was fierce, 31-34, with a difference of only one and a half baskets. After 39-33, Wenzhang and V. Kailoski were eliminated one after another. The situation was extremely tense. After 44-39, Wenlong and Ma Han were also dismissed for five fouls. Before the end of the game, Wenhua also said goodbye. When time ran out, Ta Kung forcefully defeated YMCA 52 to 47.</p>
<p>Hualian Scored a Total of 105 Points</p>
<p>In the A-League 1 game between Hualian and the American military police, Chen Xuechong shot accurately, and Wu Chengzhang dribbled in. The Da Li Company, Lian Jin, took the lead with 8-0 in an instant. Adi and Xuechong broke through the basket one after another, all using one hand, with beautiful posture. They led remotely with 16-2. The American soldiers called a timeout for help, but it was of little effect. The situation was completely controlled by Hualian. In the first half, Hualian took an absolute advantage with 50-15. After the break, the American military police lineup was greatly adjusted. Liu Fushan retired from Hualian, and Ren Xiangcheng entered the field. The American military police felt even more depressed, and their behavior gradually became abnormal. When it was over, Hualian defeated the American military police with an unprecedented record of 105 to 40.</p>

<h3>Chairman Huo Hosts First Reception for Reporters, Explains Efforts in Import Management, Rational Allocation, Simple Procedures, and Improved Work Efficiency</h3>
<p>[Our News] Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Import Management Committee, held his first press conference at the Bank of China yesterday afternoon at 3:30. More than 30 domestic and foreign reporters attended. Chairman Huo delivered a speech, explaining that due to China's economic capabilities and economic environment, the management of import and export trade adopts the principle of living within our means, that is, imports cannot exceed exports. In the early days of recovery, due to excessive optimism among the government and the public, the management of imports and exports was inevitably lax, resulting in great losses. Without unexpected external resistance, it may take five years of hardship like today to restore balance. In 1942, when the outcome of World War II was still undecided, the United Kingdom began to study the post-war trade management plan, and wartime control measures needed to retain some parts after the war. The implementation of management today has indeed achieved great results, and its vision and vigorous implementation are worthy of our admiration and emulation. Huo also pointed out that today's imports are entirely determined by foreign exchange. Before obtaining methods of increasing revenue, we can only learn the method of "drinking water in the desert," and inconvenience is inevitable. As for the allocation of import foreign exchange, it will depend on the importance of demand. For example, raw materials necessary for production naturally take precedence over luxury goods. Public utility power professions, because they can affect other industries, take precedence over other industries. Among coal and metal mines, the former also takes precedence. The Management Committee plans to conduct a comprehensive study on this in the future, and hopes that each industry will also conduct similar studies internally. As for exports, today's exporters often complain about insufficient costs and high freight rates. This matter involves the currency system and exchange rate, and is not only a trade problem. The committee will cooperate with all parties to do its best to assist so that domestic goods can be sold to overseas markets. Foreign businessmen in China will inevitably find it inconvenient due to our country's trade management. It is hoped that they can demonstrate a spirit of cooperation and overcome this difficult period together. All problems can be openly discussed and mutually understood. Finally, Chairman Huo also explained the future direction of the Import Management Committee's efforts, the main points of which are: Formulating various priority procedures to make the allocation rational. Stipulating various principles so that the acceptance of applications can be decided with one sentence, so as not to cause delays due to mutual evasion between various departments. To this end, an advisory group will be established to facilitate business applications. Using the status of an executive agency, to provide the government with practical information and make practical suggestions so that the government can consider the facts and not be too idealistic when deciding on import and export management policies. There were too many rules and regulations established in the past, and businessmen did not know what to follow, which will be simplified. Improving the work efficiency of the Import Management Committee to make it a service agency.</p>
<p>After Huo's report, reporters raised many questions, but no concrete answers were given at the time. It was only revealed that the fifth period quota is currently being compiled; the repeated price increase of kerosene is actually due to the increase in foreign exchange tariffs and the rise in general prices.</p>
<h3>National Bank to Accept Applications Immediately for Purchasing Part of Manufacturers' Finished Products</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Four Joint Treasury is studying the issue of future loans. Responsible parties have stated: The National Bank will definitely not resume lending before Lunar New Year's Eve. During the period of suspension of lending, in order to alleviate the difficulties of Shanghai manufacturers due to sluggish sales of finished products and inflexible turnover, the government has decided to appropriately purchase their finished products, and the Four Joint Treasury has formulated eight temporary measures for Shanghai National Bank to purchase manufacturers' finished products on behalf of the government, entrusting the National Bank to handle it. Regarding the starting time of the purchase, according to the National Bank spokesperson, the bank has received a notice from the Four Joint Treasury and is consulting with the Three Banks and Two Bureaus on the technical issues of the purchase. From now on, the bank can accept manufacturers' applications.</p>
<p>In addition, there was an outside rumor that the National Bank recently allocated 50 billion to lend to five commercial banks in the city in order to maintain finance during the Spring Festival. The National Bank spokesperson said that this was absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Weakens, Cloth is Flat and Listless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened slightly firm in the morning. Later, due to dyeing and weaving factories processing fine yarn, and a few merchant groups also buying in, prices gradually rose. Towards the close, as concerns about the implementation of registration spread and confidence waned, sales from various parties increased, causing prices to weaken. Consequently, fine yarns such as 42-count "Blue Silk" rose by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, due to the replication factory's absorption, reaching 58.4 million yuan. Coarse yarns like 16-count "Guangming" and "Sanming" remained firm in price due to active purchasing by local and external merchant groups. Other counts of fine yarn all continued to fall, ranging from 100,000 to 5-600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw continued price increases due to Hankou merchant groups still coming to Shanghai with cash to purchase. However, upon hearing news of yarn price declines and potential export restrictions, confidence turned weak again. Chinese dyeing factories sold a large amount of grey cloth, and small manufacturers successively emerged to purchase cotton yarn. Transactions among dealers were also sluggish, and there was a lack of momentum. Consequently, the prices of various 12-pound fine cloths all fell by 5,000 to 13,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The overall trend was that, except for "Zhigong" and raw cloth which remained relatively firm, other cloths showed a flat and listless trend.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 11,300 bolts, or 40 strips per application. There were 253 applications, and excluding four applications from manufacturers who purchased 720 bolts, the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton is Firm and Attractive</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw cotton market saw slightly improved sales. Yarn factories from other ports began to replenish their stocks, and transactions became more active. Local yarn factories also had demand, and the market was slightly firm. In the afternoon, due to the weakening of cotton yarn prices, the ground became slightly soft. Later, as dealers still had ample funds, and retail investors covered their positions, the trend rebounded, with 1,020 bales traded. Factory delivery prices were 4.415 million yuan for "Kaihan Fine," 4.753 million yuan for "Yao Hua," and 5.787 million yuan for "Tuolisi," with 570 bales traded. Warehouse delivery prices were 5.704 million yuan for "Tuolisi," and 5.291 million to 5.373 million yuan for "Kaihan Fine," with 450 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was 1.22 million to 1.23 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Stagnant</h3>

Consolidated Class C bonds opened at 65,000 in the morning, with a high of 67,500, a low of 64,000, and then turned flat. In the end, Classes A, B, D, and E were flat compared to the previous close, while Consolidated Class C rose slightly by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw a stagnant situation yesterday. Ewo Cotton Mill opened at 580,000, and retreated from 595,000 to around 560,000.

The process was quite sluggish.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Industrial Crisis</h3>
<p>Industrial Association Qingdao Branch Representatives Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Industrial Association Qingdao Branch members, facing unprecedented difficulties in the local industrial environment, specially organized a petition group consisting of representatives Yin Zhizhong, Zhang Mingting, Yu Putian, Sun Xiangpu, Jiang Hequan, Yu Lianbi, etc., who arrived in Shanghai successively a few days ago, and jointly went to Beijing last night. They plan to separately petition the relevant ministries and departments of the central government, requesting assistance. It is claimed that the serious problems facing the industrial sector in Qingdao are sixfold: 1. Heavy and numerous taxes. 2. Lack of fuel, resulting in work stagnation. 3. The ban on transporting southern wheat to the north, causing the flour industry to halt. 4. Suspension of production loans, leading to factory funding shortages and forced shutdowns. 5. Insufficient foreign exchange quotas, resulting in high material procurement costs. 6. Political parties manipulating labor unrest, threatening safe production. Therefore, they plan to propose six suggestions to the central government: 1. Regarding profit tax, please follow the example of Jinan City and exempt business tax. For industries that meet national defense and people's livelihood needs, reduce it by half. All other proposed levies should be waived. 2. Instruct the Fuel Management Committee to supply 20,000 tons of coal per month for industrial use in Qingdao. 3. Instruct the Ministry of Food to cancel the transportation of southern wheat to the north and allocate as much imported wheat as possible. 4. Quickly open mortgage production loans, and issue 150 billion yuan in emergency production loans before the lunar new year. 5. Request the Shipping Management Committee to increase Qingdao's foreign exchange quota to US$2 million. 6. Strictly prohibit political parties from interfering in labor movements.</p>

Regarding the increased capital requirement, as the capacity of brokers varies, they hoped that there would be no rigid requirement to increase capital to 500 million yuan across the board. Later, they submitted a written petition. The Securities Exchange authorities agreed to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for flexible handling.</p>
<p>[Also News] The Ministry of Finance and Economics' instructions on the method of transferring listed company stocks, with six measures, were issued to the Securities Exchange yesterday. The Securities Exchange immediately instructed 32 listed companies to take note. However, in item 3 of the reported measures yesterday, after the characters "one, two, four," the words "If the application documents are not provided by the deadline, listing should be temporarily suspended" were omitted.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth for Coal Issue is Ripe</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to solve the coal shortage problem, the China Textile Construction Company is currently negotiating with India, the Philippines, and other places to exchange yarn and cloth for coal. It has now reached a mature stage. Once the shipping procedures with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are settled, a formal contract can be signed with India and the Philippines. It is heard that the first batch is scheduled to exchange for 20,000 tons of Indian coal and Philippine coal each. The price of yarn and cloth exported by the Textile Construction Company will be based on the US dollar pricing of the Textile Export Commission. The US dollar price of Indian and Philippine coal will also be determined, and then the barter ratio will be mutually agreed upon.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association General Meeting Discusses Response to Control Measures, Elects Representatives to State Opinions to Director Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a temporary general meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Regarding matters of concern for the survival of the industry, many members attended. Tang Xinghai presided over the meeting. The topic of discussion was the implementation details of the Yarn Management Committee. Since industry members had not been given the opportunity to participate in the research and contribute opinions, and the announcement had been made hastily, there were many difficult and impossible aspects. The members were very anxious. The members were quite critical of the Board of Directors for failing to pay attention to and neglecting the interests of the industry in the past. After a discussion of four small groups, the following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>*   Agency spinning and weaving should be carried out through contracts. Any measures that exceed the scope of agency spinning and weaving are difficult to accept.</p>
<p>*   Wu Shuying, Zhu Shangyi, Han Zhiming, Wang Zhuyi, and Tang Huanru were elected to form a declaration drafting committee to issue a declaration outlining the current situation and crisis of the industry.</p>
<p>*   Rong Hongyuan, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, and Wang Zhuyi were elected as six representatives to state their opinions to Director Yuan, requesting that: 1. The registration of cotton yarn be temporarily suspended until each factory has received cotton for agency spinning. 2. The six points previously proposed by the association should be implemented. 3. There is no need to establish resident factory personnel to avoid wasting national funds and creating abuses. 4. All implementation details should be postponed until the association has had the opportunity to research and contribute opinions.</p>
<p>*   If the representatives are unable to obtain satisfactory results from Director Yuan, all members will petition in Beijing.</p>
<p>*   The mills are running low on raw cotton supplies and need to replenish them urgently. If the Yarn Management Committee cannot supply them in time, leading to forced shutdowns, the Yarn Management Committee should be fully responsible for the serious consequences.</p>
<p>*   Send a letter to the National Yarn Factory Federation to convene a meeting and advocate for a unified position.</p>
<p>*   Yuan Guoliang, Zhu Fuju, Rong Guangliang, Xue Zuheng, Zhang Wenkui, Nuo Shangyi, Han Zhiming, Wang Weiyin, Zhang Wenqian, Wu Kunsheng, Liu Piji, Tang Huanru, Shao Baohu, and Tang Junyuan were elected as fourteen representatives to present the serious situation of the industry to the Municipal Government, Garrison Headquarters, and Social Affairs Bureau, requesting attention. They will also appeal to the Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and relevant parties.</p>
<p>*   Finally, as a temporary motion, it was requested that the association notify its member factories to await the handling of negotiations between Muzeng and the Yarn Management Committee regarding all measures, in order to achieve consistency.</p>
<p>Responsible Person of the Yarn Management Committee Discusses the Meaning of Cotton Yarn Registration</p>
<p>[Our Report] After the announcement and implementation of the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Committee's cotton yarn registration measures, it is heard that yarn factories believe that this registration is tantamount to freezing cotton yarn, and the factories will inevitably feel difficulties in their capital turnover during the upcoming Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>According to the responsible person of the committee, cotton yarn registration is an important preliminary measure for managing cotton yarn. It can prevent hoarding, smuggling, and speculative trading of cotton yarn. Cotton yarn produced by yarn factories cannot leave the factory without a permit. Replication industries that are allocated cotton yarn cannot resell it for profit. Cloth merchants and dyeing factories that are allocated grey cloth cannot use it to loop back and acquire yarn. However, once the cotton yarn registration certificate is obtained, it can be transported and sold with the certificate. Previous transportation and sales restrictions, such as the southern transportation restriction, have already been lifted. Not only is it not frozen, but legitimate manufacturers will only find it more convenient than before. The claims from outside are actually misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the function of the cotton yarn registration certificate is just like a citizen's identity card. It would be ridiculous to say that issuing identity cards to citizens freezes them. In the past, it was difficult to define how cotton yarn constituted hoarding, and inspection and handling were difficult. In the future, a clear definition will be obtained. Any cotton yarn without a certificate or with an expired registration certificate will be considered hoarding. Once discovered, it can be dealt with. Legitimate manufacturers can thus obtain legal protection for their existing cotton yarn.</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion of Rheumatism and its Treatments</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>The occurrence and progression of rheumatism are indeed very complex and cannot be fully described in this article. What this article discusses is the significant impact of rheumatism on life and its latest treatments.</p>
<p>In recent years, medical scientists from various countries around the world have exhausted their efforts to study the causes and treatments of various diseases that harm the human body. For example, for tuberculosis, cancer, leprosy, poliomyelitis, and other diseases, large sums of money have been raised to establish various research institutes, and specialized personnel have been hired to conduct research. However, rheumatism seems to be forgotten and not paid attention to. In fact, rheumatism is a very harmful disease to humans and should not be ignored. According to the report of A.E. Luckhardt of the Third Hospital of the University of Chicago, traces of chronic rheumatic arthritis have been found in the skeletons of reptiles from six million years ago. This has been fully proven by exhibits in the Chicago Museum of Antiquities for verification. Also, there are traces of chronic rheumatic arthritis in the skeletons of ape-men who lived two million years ago. Moreover, the skeletons of the Java man, Peking man, and mummies buried in Egyptian pyramids from 500,000 to 8,000 years ago also have traces of chronic rheumatic arthritis. It can be seen that rheumatism is a powerful and deeply penetrating disease. In fact, if we statistically analyze disabled patients, the number of rheumatic patients among them is also not small. According to the estimate of the aforementioned Luckhardt, there are a total of ten million rheumatic patients in the United States. This number exceeds the combined total number of patients with tuberculosis, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease nationwide. Among these ten million rheumatic patients, seven million suffer from articular rheumatism, of which 150,000 are completely disabled and unable to work, and another one million are unable to work for five months out of the year. It can be seen the wide range of rheumatisms' attack and its impact on life. Our country's new medical undertakings are not yet developed, and medical authorities are currently too busy to take care of it, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of rheumatism, of course, a correct diagnosis is the prerequisite. However, a correct diagnosis of rheumatism is often not easy to obtain, because there are many similar diseases, and if one is slightly negligent, there is no way to avoid being misdiagnosed. For example, uric acid arthritis, hyperthyroidism, post-traumatic joint synovitis, tendinitis, articular fibrous tissue inflammation, joint mucous bursitis, joint reversal joint dislocation, etc., can be easily misdiagnosed as chronic rheumatic arthritis if not carefully examined. Also, suppurative arthritis, tuberculous arthritis, syphilitic arthritis, and pneumococcal arthritis, etc., are also very easy to misdiagnose as rheumatic arthritis. In addition, diseases such as periostitis arthritis, cancerous diseases, neuritis diseases, spinal cord wasting diseases, inflammatory syringomyelia, histiocytosis, and hemophilic arthritis all have similar symptoms and must be carefully differentiated to avoid errors in diagnosis. If our doctors and patients encounter bone and joint pain, severe muscle therapy, etc., without thinking, they believe that they are suffering from rheumatism and take rheumatism drugs, and the result will certainly not be cured, leading to suspicion that the drugs are ineffective. In fact, what is the harm of drugs that are not prescribed correctly?</p>
<p>Regarding the various theoretical issues in treatment (for example, women with rheumatism can suddenly recover during pregnancy. Also, patients with rheumatism can suddenly recover due to suffering from jaundice, etc.) I will temporarily omit them due to space limitations. There are many treatments for rheumatism that we currently know, such as hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, physical therapy, and drug therapy, etc. In drug therapy, salicylic acid preparations, amino acid agents, gold preparations, vitamin preparations, endocrine preparations, and protein preparations, etc., were previously popular. However, none of them are satisfactory. In recent years, the United States has used large amounts of gold preparations and vitamin preparations, but the results after testing were not good. Also, bee venom therapy has long been advocated, but its effects are also not good. According to the report of Luckhardt, since the past eighteen years, he has been using the Cutivaccih Paul method advocated by Dr. Gustav Paul, former director of the Vienna National Serum Laboratory, in 1927. This method is very good and reliable in efficacy. Luckhardt himself also suffered from rheumatic arthritis, tried all methods, and was not cured for a long time. Later, he was advised by Prof. Dr. E. Pribram, professor of bacteriology at the University of Chicago, to try the aforementioned method, and it was immediately effective after one try. According to the experience of the past eighteen years, it can be proven that this method is absolutely reliable. This type of subcutaneous injection of Paul's serum is a serum extracted from a bacterium called Saprophyten (腐化菌), with a corresponding amount of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein metabolite (Tubermucin) added, plus a one-to-one thousandth portion of filtered and sterilized smallpox bacterial serum, and infiltrated with a small amount of old Tuberculin (that is, the previously advocated tuberculosis bacterial serum). It has miraculous effects on chronic articular rheumatism, chronic muscular rheumatism, sciatica, and other neuralgia and muscle pain, etc. It is specially written to introduce it.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Translated by Hua Xiren</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a disease that many people have contracted. It is a disease of pleasure, and also a disease easily caught (Clap. Gleet). It is a highly infectious disease caused by a very small diplococcus called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea is contracted through unclean sexual intercourse; it is as prevalent as a cold. Gonorrhea and syphilis are two different diseases; however, they can be transmitted to the same person in the same place. Gonorrhea cannot turn into syphilis, and similarly, syphilis does not easily turn into gonorrhea. After a first infection is completely cured, one can be infected again.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea in Men</p>
<p>After unclean sexual intercourse, gonorrheal bacteria invade the urethra in the genital area, attach to and multiply on the inner wall of the urethra, and then reach the sexual organs. Commonly, gonococci can also pass into our blood vessels, and then be carried by the blood circulation to other parts of the body. They can invade the heart, joints, and form rheumatism and arthritis.</p>
<p>The first symptom Sign of gonorrhea is a stinging and burning sensation when urinating. The pathological changes in the urethra are mostly redness and irritation. Such symptoms often appear one to three days after sexual intercourse. Purulent discharge then flows out of the penile opening, with small patches of pus blocking the urethra. The initial pus is white, but later it becomes a thick, yellowish pus. Each drop of pus contains thousands of bacteria, which are easily transmitted through contact. If a small drop of pus enters the eye, it can easily cause blindness. In the groin, the lymph nodes in the inguinal region begin to swell and ache, and the patient's body temperature then increases. Doctors can easily find gonococci under a microscope by applying a smear specimen to a glass slide, which is a very scientific diagnosis. At this time, if appropriate treatment is given, gonorrhea may stop from penetrating further. Conversely, if left untreated, the gonococci will advance directly into the prostate and testicles. If the testicles become inflamed, gonorrhea treatment becomes more difficult. This situation is likely to cause you to be infertile and lead to the consequence of having no descendants.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea in Women</p>
<p>The first symptom of gonorrhea in women is also a stinging sensation when urinating, with redness and swelling in the urethra and vaginal area. Subsequently, a large amount of whitish-yellow pus is discharged. As long as there is fluid flowing from the vagina, whether it is white or yellow, it suggests that you have contracted gonorrhea and should see a doctor immediately; because gonococci have the potential to run into the uterus through the vagina. When it invades the fallopian tubes and ovaries, gonorrhea can persist until the end of her life. Gonorrhea is the best reason to prove why you will never have children.</p>
<p>How to Treat Gonorrhea</p>
<p>When you find signs of gonorrhea, go to a doctor for advice as soon as possible, and follow and trust the doctor's guidance. Remember that early treatment is essential. Self-treatment is dangerous.</p>
<p>Do not consult quacks or shopkeepers. In particular, do not self-medicate with over-the-counter drugs. This will harm both your finances and your health. Because gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat, only qualified scientific doctors understand the treatment methods, so you must trust them.</p>
<p>Avoid sexual arousal and abstain from sexual intercourse, especially during treatment, which must be absolutely stopped; otherwise, it will be detrimental to you and easily transmit the disease to others.</p>
<p>Avoid drinking alcohol: because any kind of alcohol can increase secretion and discharge, and at the same time, aggravate inflammation. It is best to drink plenty of water.</p>
<p>Gentle exercises can be done, and bowel movements should be smooth.</p>
<p>Do not change the dressing to cover the penis or vagina. Because this makes it difficult for the pus to be discharged, and the inflammation gradually worsens.</p>
<p>After touching the genital area, you must wash your hands with soap and water to prevent the spread of gonococci to others, including your own children. Sometimes, gonococci can be transmitted to the eyes by hand, so all towels, cups, bowls, and other personal items must be disinfected and rinsed. Enema equipment must never be reused by others, otherwise the chance of infection will be even greater.</p>
<p>If the testicles are swollen, all treatment must be suspended, and you should rest quietly in bed, applying an ice pack or a warm water bag to the swollen area.</p>
<p>Disinfectant washes are more effective for female gonorrhea, but they must be done under the guidance of a doctor.</p>
<p>There is hope for a full recovery, especially with penicillin and sulfonamide chemicals like Sulfadiazine. However, although these drugs are valuable, they are also very dangerous. If taken improperly, they can also lose their effectiveness. So you don't have to take them yourself, you must accept the guidance of a qualified doctor, only they know the changes in gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Signs of a Full Recovery</p>
<p>Do not assume that gonorrhea is cured just because there is no pus discharge. Pus discharge may also stop when treatment is delayed or improperly done. But the question to consider is whether the gonococci have penetrated deep into the body? If the gonococci have shifted their line of attack, then the inflammation has not stopped. Doctors can use many ways to test and confirm whether you are completely cured. Doctors can use the following methods to examine you: A. Examine the urine, B. Use a microscope to look for gonococci, C. Massage the prostate to determine if there is pus now, D. Carefully examine the vagina.</p>
<p>After the above examination procedures, if it is proven that no gonococci are found, then we can say that it is cured. We can also guarantee that it is cured. However, as a precaution, the patient, for the sake of protecting their spouse, should still abstain from sexual intercourse for several months after recovery. (Translated from a booklet published by the U.S. Public Health Service, titled Gororrttea the crippler)</p>
<h3>Defense Against Pulmonary Tuberculosis (3)</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Pulmonary Tuberculosis Incidence and Residence: The greater the population density, the easier it is to contract pulmonary tuberculosis. For example, it is easier to contract pulmonary tuberculosis in urban schools. A statistical study of the relationship between tuberculosis mortality and residence in Edinburgh, England, from 1910 to 1912:</p>
<p>It can be seen that the larger the living area, the better the conditions such as light, air, and temperature, and the factors that cause disease can be reduced. Therefore, Rnbunt advocates that each person should have twenty cubic meters of air. Houses with poor lighting and ventilation are very susceptible to disease.</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Pulmonary Tuberculosis Incidence and War: During foreign operations, life is turbulent, prices are high, and nutrition is poor. In addition, the spirit suffers severe blows, so at the end of the war, the tuberculosis incidence tends to increase. In Germany, before the First World War, the mortality rate from pulmonary tuberculosis was 1.36 percent, and during the war it was 2.3 percent. It can be seen that war can cause a sharp increase in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Three Diabetes: Diabetes has been recognized as a factor in promoting the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis. In Root's report of autopsies on 1121 diabetic cadavers, the expected two or three cases were found. Diabetes was found to occur in young people aged fifteen to twenty in a high school in Massachusetts, while pulmonary tuberculosis developed at the age of sixteen. In fact, the onset of tuberculosis follows the occurrence of diabetes.</p>
<p>Four Pregnancy: It is generally believed that pregnancy reduces resistance to tuberculosis, and only attention is paid to the protection of maternal abortion. Recent studies have shown that postpartum care and family care should be given special attention to latent tuberculosis. In fact, pregnant women are satisfied with prenatal care and there are fewer hindrances to pregnancy, but they are more likely to feel at risk during postpartum care. Because it is not anticipated that resistance to tuberculosis will be reduced after childbirth, tuberculosis is most likely to develop and cause great harm during this time.</p>
<p>Five Immunity: Humans have no innate immunity, and everyone can contract tuberculosis. In our country, almost everyone has had tuberculosis. Ninety percent of children who contract tubercle bacilli develop miliary tuberculosis and die. Some also develop local (pulmonary lymph) tuberculosis. In the local aspect, some die due to weakened physical resistance, and some surround the tuberculosis lesions due to increased resistance. If there are still living tubercle bacilli in the lesions, the result of the surrounding is twofold: one is that resistance decreases and nutrition is poor, so it can recur. The other is that resistance increases and eventually calcifies. This can be said to be a complete cure for tuberculosis. If a person has not contracted tuberculosis in childhood, they are also prone to infection when they reach adulthood. This is mostly systemic miliary tuberculosis. It can be seen from this that immunity can only occur when there are living tubercle bacilli in the body, that is, the body has special resistance only when the living tubercle bacilli are surrounded. Therefore, there is immunity only through infection. Therefore, tuberculosis is an infectious immunity. After infection immunity, there is considerable resistance to the invasion of tubercle bacilli. However, we know very little about the immunological principles of tuberculosis, and what we understand is that rich nutrition, adequate rest, fresh air, and other good sanitary environments are sufficient to increase our resistance to prevent infection.</p>
<p>The source of tubercle bacilli invading the human body is mostly the human-type tubercle bacilli excreted from the bodies of tuberculosis patients. There are also bovine-type tubercle bacilli that cause disease in the body. The modes and routes of transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>Foodborne Transmission: This is mostly transmitted through the digestive tract and is more common in children. It is often transmitted due to drinking milk containing tubercle bacilli, or infected by human milk or artificial milk. Also, sharing food utensils with patients can bring tubercle bacilli into the intestines. According to experimental evidence, tubercle bacilli can penetrate the intestinal membrane of healthy animals and enter the lymph and blood, reaching the lungs directly. Due to the filtration effect of capillaries in the lungs, they attach to the alveoli. Furthermore, because the lungs are particularly susceptible, pulmonary tuberculosis is produced. Other diseases such as lymph tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis are also mostly discovered in this way.</p>
<p>Contact Transmission: The sputum, pus, etc. of pulmonary tuberculosis patients can cause tuberculosis in healthy people. For example, children playing on the ground are very susceptible to infection if they encounter sputum with tubercle bacilli. Therefore, it is inappropriate for children to crawl on the ground. Common living habits, such as sleeping in the same room, kissing, etc., if one of them is a pulmonary tuberculosis patient, then the other people are very likely to contract pulmonary tuberculosis. Other excrement such as feces, urine, and pus left by pulmonary tuberculosis patients, as well as contaminated equipment, drinking water, food, etc., can also cause transmission, leading to intestinal tuberculosis, urinary and reproductive system tuberculosis, and skin tuberculosis, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Sanitary Discussion on Keeping Warm and Cold</h3>
<p>— Baiding</p>
<p>In the past two days, the cold wave from Siberia visited Shanghai, turning the city into a situation where water drips into ice and the north wind is piercingly cold. When people meet, they either say, "How can it be so cold!" or "It's really unbearable these days!"</p>
<p>Therefore, "keeping warm and resisting the cold" has imperceptibly become an important task for every citizen.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the opportunity to talk about the sanitary methods of "keeping warm and resisting the cold".</p>
<p>Keeping warm and resisting the cold is a multi-faceted thing: using electric stoves, fireplaces, radiators (recently, there are also American-made electric radiators on the market) to increase the temperature of the indoor environment, which is a passive method; wearing more clothes, which is also a passive method; eating more warming foods, such as fatty foods, which is an active method; engaging in full-force exercise, such as running and playing ball, or doing various freehand exercises indoors, which is also an active method of keeping the body warm. Secondly, bathing is also a sanitary activity that warms and resists the cold.</p>
<p>Electric stoves, fireplaces, radiators, and electric radiators are indeed passive methods of resisting the cold, but they require economic conditions and are not suitable for the public. Among the four million Shanghai citizens, I think most people do not have these economic conditions and therefore do not have the privilege of enjoying these superior cold-resistant equipment. Coal stoves—coal stoves without chimneys—seem to be more suitable for the general public in terms of economic conditions, but in terms of hygiene, they are the most unhygienic heating method. Every winter, batches of people are poisoned by coal gas and die, which is reported in the newspapers and seen by readers. Therefore, this kind of coal stove without a chimney is the most unhygienic and life-threatening warming tool and should never be used.</p>
<p>However, recently, due to the soaring price of coal briquettes, even coal stoves without chimneys are unaffordable for the average commoner due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>If economics is not a problem, then electric stoves, fireplaces, or radiators are all fine, as you please. However, please note: take off your clothes when entering the room and put on your clothes when leaving the room, so as to keep your body temperature constant; otherwise, catching a cold and coughing will create business for doctors and pharmacies again.</p>
<p>As for wearing clothes, apart from the poor and miserable children who have no economic means to wear warm clothes, and the "modern ladies" who have the economic means but are unwilling to wear warm clothes, ordinary people all know that wearing more clothes when the weather is cold can achieve the purpose of keeping warm and resisting the cold. One thing that should be noted is: do not wear too much to the point of hindering the body's movement; because movement can generate heat, and its cold-resistant effect is no less than that of clothing to keep warm.</p>
<p>The reason why eating more fat can generate heat is also very simple; why are big fat people less afraid of the cold? It's because their body has several pounds more fat than others. But this also has economic conditions; if even the third or fourth-class coarse indica rice cannot fill the empty stomach of a poor friend, how can we talk about eating oil today and chewing meat tomorrow? However, some fortunate friends are happy to eat more of these fatty foods. At the same time, it should also be noted: it is also not advisable to force yourself to eat too much, otherwise, you will upset your stomach and cause indigestion, and I will not be responsible!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that exercise is beneficial to human health. In winter, it can not only exercise the body and benefit health, but also warm the body and increase warmth, which is truly the most active and effective method of resisting the cold. If you don't have time to play ball or the opportunity to kick a ball, there is always an opportunity to run on the road. This is not only more economical than taking a motorcycle card or a rickshaw, but also more hygienic and more beneficial to health.</p>
<p>The working class often uses their all-day labor to compensate for the shortcomings of their single clothes and coarse food in keeping warm and resisting the cold.</p>
<p>In addition to the function of cleaning the skin, bathing also has the function of promoting the metabolism of the skin. Precisely because it has the function of promoting the metabolism of the skin, it also has the effect of warming and resisting the cold.</p>

<h3>A Miracle</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>According to recent news from the New York Times, Mr. Varga, who has consistently held the position of authority in Soviet economics for twenty years, has recently been abandoned by the Soviet authorities. Mr. Varga was the director of the World Political Economy Lecture Series at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. But now, not only has Mr. Varga himself been removed from his post, but the World Political Economy Department he presided over has also been abolished, and more than twenty economists who worked with him have also been expelled by the authorities.</p>
<p>There have been several major cleansing events in Soviet politics, such as the cleansing of the Trotskyists, and later the cleansing of Radek, Bukharin, and others. However, the previous major purges were all caused by political issues, but this time the cleansing of Varga has no direct political connection, but is because Varga insisted on his economic theory.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times report, Varga published an economic work (title unknown) not long ago. Based on the conclusions he reached after studying the current state of the world economy, Varga believed that Western capitalist countries would not experience economic panic in the ten years after the war, the lives of workers in capitalist countries would improve during the war, and many colonial economic plunders have now been abandoned. He further pointed out that the war did not increase the wealth of capitalist countries.</p>
<p>Varga further admitted that his objective economic analysis forced him to reach conclusions that were exactly the opposite of the Soviet Party's position. Because the Soviet Party's economic estimate of the post-war world was that capitalist countries would inevitably experience a major economic panic after the war, and the lives of workers in various countries would inevitably deteriorate, thus creating an "objective situation" "favorable" to the revolution. And now this economic authority of the proletariat has completely overthrown this "estimate"!</p>
<p>I have not studied economics, and I have never had the opportunity to read Varga's works, so I have absolutely no feelings of love or hatred for Varga personally. I have no way of judging which of his past and present theories is correct. However, an economist with a reputation of twenty years like Varga would probably not be completely baseless in this economic analysis he made this time; and he is still living in Moscow, so he would not publicly betray his country.</p>
<p>However, Varga has now finally "fallen out of favor," but it is not due to any personal fault of his, but because he is loyal to his scholarship, loyal to his identity as an economist—that is, loyal to the academic truth he pursues.</p>
<p>It is said that after the Soviet authorities discovered the "error" in Varga's theory, they organized a court to try him and asked him to admit his mistake. But Varga only replied that he could slightly modify his theory, and even willing to provide any political explanation, but he refused to change the conclusions he made based on the facts.</p>
<p>How much this shows the martyrdom of a scholar! What is even more commendable is that Varga is not a citizen growing up in the atmosphere of a democratic and free country. He may be a member of the Soviet Union, and may have received the Red Star or Lenin Medal, but all of this did not become an obstacle to his pursuit of truth before he buried himself in academic research, and instead gave him courage.</p>
<p>Of course, Varga's past and present economic theories may not be truth, but his willingness not to echo what others say and his courage to observe facts prove that he is indeed a valuable scholar. We can certainly oppose his economic theories, but we cannot help but admire his arrogance as a scholar.</p>
<p>In today's world, the so-called academic atmosphere has declined to the point where it can no longer decline. Generally speaking, scholars either speak with glasses on or have a so-called background. And those who sell their reputation and fish for fame are everywhere. What is even stranger is that scholars also have factions, and sectarian ideology often replaces truth. Therefore, emotional impulses often replace academic and truth exploration. People like Varga are said to be a minority among minorities, and even more meaningfully, such an event actually occurred in a country behind the "Iron Curtain," which cannot be said to be a remarkable miracle.</p>
<h3>Traveling in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Tang Naixin</p>
<p>In the past, Huang Gongdu's "Renjinglu Poems" contained "Traveling in Taiwan". When I first read this poem, it was about twenty-five years ago. As a child, I recited poems without seeking profound understanding, only feeling that they were easy to read aloud and recite. During the Anti-Japanese War, I took refuge in Sichuan and taught Chinese at Sichuan Women's High School. I once taught "Traveling in Taiwan", and I vaguely remember that this article was on the Kaiming Loose-Leaf Literary Selections.</p>
<p>Recently, after returning from a trip to Taiwan, I remembered this poem. I searched for a copy of "Renjinglu Poems" in bookstores, both large and small, new and old, but there was no such book. Even the "Kaiming Loose-Leaf Literary Selections" has been out of print. I also failed to find it at the Cold Library. Later, because a friend was in the library of the College of Liberal Arts of National Taiwan University, I wrote to him to find a copy and send it to me. The purpose was to find this "Traveling in Taiwan". Recently, I received a reply stating that the library only had a card and no original book, because it had been lost during the restoration period. However, they had copied it from a private collection of books, etc. Receiving a letter from afar makes it seem even more precious. Reading "Traveling in Taiwan" in today's situation makes it feel even more intimate and meaningful. Therefore, I am recording it to contribute to Free Talk.</p>
<p>"The drums on the city head boom like thunder, Heavens, heavens, tears fall like you, The Japanese have unexpectedly cut Taiwan away. Originally, the territory was included in the celestial palace, Heavenly might reached far to the land of the rising sun, My ancestors, generations ago, Cleared weeds and came to this land, Sugar, frost, tea, snow, trillions of trees, Annual taxes of countless gold coins, Why do you tighten me so, heavens, why the anger, Taking my fat to supply the enemy, Greedy and insatiable, these big rats, What crime have the people committed to suffer this, Who destroyed Qin, three households of Chu, Not to mention millions of households in Fujian and Guangdong. Success or failure, benefit or disadvantage, are not what we see, Everyone swears to die and refuses to surrender, All hearts are one, who dares to insult. A sound of drawing swords and striking pillars, There is nothing else to say today, Those who do not follow, I will kill you with my own hands, The blue flag of the school stands with a yellow tiger, The whole city crowds to watch the empty streets dance, A gold seal as big as a dou is tightly held, Directly calling the president the governor; 'Today's government is for the people, Tainan and Taipei are firmly our territory, Do not cross the forbidden zone by even one step!' In the fifth month, the sea city winds howls, Three hundred golden-winged ships fly in, Chasing giant ships like a tide, The former climbs ashore, a brave tiger, The latter seizes the pass, a flying monkey, The village field's guns, Bizen swords, Fall when they are cut, blood pestles float, Gods burn and ghosts rot, city gates burn, Who can fight and defend, who can escape, A round of red sun is high in the sky. Thousands of white flags flutter in the wind, The elders and gentry invite each other, Kneeling on both sides of the road, bowing deeply, Red-tasseled bamboo caps, brocade ribbons, Blue silk braids hanging like clouds, Kneeling and holding silver plates of tea and cakes, Silk-soaked melons, purple grapes. 'General has come from afar, no doubt tired, Surrendered people respectfully guide the general.' The general said, 'Come, call your people, You and I are yellow-skinned compatriots originally, Extending from Prince Yan, a hero among men, Actually opening this land to divide the thatch, Today, return to me what Heaven has taught, The country is benevolent and wise like Tang Yao, Nurturing you and educating you, different from the Li people, Pacify your families, mother knows.' The general walks slowly, the dust does not stir, Ten thousand horses enter the city, the wind sighs, Alas, the general is not a god, The imperial army's might and virtue encompass all, Our lives are in the general's hands, How dare we not return to the enlightened and holy dynasty, Alas, alas, woe is you, the whole of Taiwan! Yesterday, how loyal and brave, today, how timid, All things reversed with a blink of an eye, Usually unprepared for war and defense, What do you rely on, calling yourselves 'loyal' and 'righteous'?"</p>
<h3>A Word on Helping Students</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>With the winter vacation just beginning, the biggest problem facing students is how to manage tuition for the next semester.</p>
<p>Studying is the right of the next generation of young people. It is truly shameful and disgraceful for this generation of middle-aged people to allow young people to struggle and appeal for the issue of dropping out of school. Students beg for money from door to door and work part-time in the cold and heat, warming themselves with their own hands. Can such a large society stand by and watch them live and die without providing assistance? "Youth are the pillars of society and the foundation of the country." This sentence has been known since writing weekly reports in elementary school. It is the most overused cliché, but despite the dry mouths and calloused ears from hearing it, our "pillars" and "foundations" are becoming more and more fragile, unable to withstand ruthless destruction, and have reached the brink of ruin!</p>
<p>Student aid has been around for several years, but it gets more and more difficult each year, and worse each semester. The need becomes more urgent and widespread, while the supply decreases proportionally and becomes more difficult to obtain. The reason is simple: "Too busy to care for oneself, unable to help others." Only eight big words. Under the heavens, everyone is poor. Those with a conscience who are willing to help others have all become paupers. "Good people in the world are generally poor." Adding zero plus zero plus zero, even tens of millions of times, the result is still a zero. This society does not lack enthusiastic people, but unfortunately, enthusiastic people have nothing but a warm heart. They cannot even raise enough money for their own children's tuition, let alone the tuition for other people's children. Perhaps some people will say, "Ask the rich to donate generously! Isn't Shanghai full of rich people?" But this question can be turned around. If they were to donate generously, then they would not become rich. It is easy to ask someone wearing two thin layers of clothing to take off one layer to donate, but difficult to ask someone wrapped in thick furs like a big meat dumpling to take off a scarf. This is by no means an exaggeration, but a firsthand experience! The floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, winter relief, each time involve hundreds of billions of dollars. Following that is the massive project of student aid. Before the end of the year when all industries are depressed and the market is sluggish, only God knows how much certainty there is!</p>
<p>Apart from student aid, a closely related issue is whether students have achieved the greatest results after receiving this aid. It is most unworthy to spend money on things that are unclear. If tuition is painstakingly raised, and after half a year, all the student gains is worsened eyesight, with nothing else practical, wouldn't student aid become a huge waste? Everyone knows that tuition is so expensive, but it is not the responsibility of the teachers. However, even if teachers cannot work on an empty stomach, they can still work extra hard to inspire students' wisdom and cultivate their abilities, thereby increasing the efficiency of the hard-earned student aid. Wise teachers will surely understand that this is also another form of student aid!</p>
<h3>Playwriting</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>A female singer is co-writing a script with a famous playwright. When the news spread, two of her acquaintances began discussing the matter.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised," one said, "how can she write a script?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it easy?" the other replied disdainfully, "She probably writes the 'breaks' between scenes."</p>

<h3>Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (57)</h3>
<p>When Madame Zhang saw that he was strongly denying everything, she knew that Yunqing's guess was correct. She did not expose him at the time, but simply nodded and said, "We are relatives, and everything can be discussed. You know Yunqing's feelings, so don't harm her." Zhu Qi vaguely agreed a couple of times, then hastily excused himself, saying that it was time for work and rushed out. This made Madame Zhang angrily tell Yunqing, saying that she would find Zhu Qi's father to tell him about Zhu Qi's reckless behavior outside with the actress. Yunqing hurriedly stopped her, saying, "That would never do. If that happens, Zhu Qi and Qiyun will be forced to run away together and get married. I have another plan, so don't be angry, Mother." After saying this, she quickly washed up and went to Fengsheng's house. She saw that Fengsheng was working as usual, without any signs of depression. She asked if Zhu Qi had come in the past few days. Fengsheng said, "I don't want him to come either. It's useless for him to come. Meeting him only makes me upset. I hope he never comes." Yunqing never expected Fengsheng to say such a decisive thing. She asked, "Does he pay your living expenses on time?" Fengsheng said, "He's very punctual about that, always sending it on time. Last time I needed to use a little more money, I wrote him a note, and he immediately sent 30 million over. I can't even use it all up at once." Yunqing was surprised and said, "He sent you 30 million! How much is his monthly salary? Where did he get so much money?" Fengsheng said, "I don't care about that. It doesn't matter to me if he stole it. I'll just ask him for money when I run out." Yunqing bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Things aren't that simple. I got some news today and came to tell you. Now that I hear Zhu Qi is giving you so much money, it further proves Zhu Qi's behavior. Can you guess where he got this money from?" As Yunqing spoke, her pair of decisive eyes looked at Fengsheng's face. Fengsheng replied with a blank expression, "How would I know! It doesn't matter to me where he got it from. It's none of my business." Yunqing shook her head, smiled slightly, and seriously said, "You can't say that. You need to know that recently, Zhu Qi has been very hot and heavy with the actress Xian Qiyun and may marry her." Yunqing thought that Fengsheng would be very affected by these words, but she remained wooden and simply rolled her eyes, saying, "I don't think he has the guts! He wouldn't dare marry an actress, wouldn't he be afraid of angering his father! His father will take care of him, so I don't need to worry." Yunqing said, "You can't look at it that way. What if he gets his father's permission? Then you'll be at a disadvantage!" Fengsheng said, "That will never happen. He doesn't have the guts." Yunqing said, "His divorcing you might be to marry Qiyun. How can you be so muddled! If you don't come out and stop it now, it will be a fait accompli in the future. What will you do then? Your future is too dangerous!"</p>
<h3>Song Jiang Subdues Fang La</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>The novel claims that Fang La was defeated by Song Jiang. However, the "History of the Song Dynasty" only records that Hou Meng wanted to recruit Song Jiang to suppress Fang La, and nothing more. In fact, it never happened. Moreover, after Song Jiang surrendered to Zhang Shuye, his name no longer appeared in historical records. Fang La was captured by Han Shizhong (see the memorial stele of Prince Han and the biography of Han Shizhong in the "History of the Song Dynasty"), which had nothing to do with Song Jiang. It seems that the novel's claim is unfounded. However, I read in the "Record of Treacherous Officials in the Restoration Era": "In the second year of Xuanhe, Fang La rebelled in Muzhou, capturing the prefectures of Wen, Tai, Wu, Chu, Hang, and Xiu, shaking the southeast. Tong Guan was appointed as the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangzhe, leading Liu Yanqing, Liu Guangshi, Xin Qizong, Song Jiang, and over 200,000 troops to suppress him... When Guan arrived in Zhejiang, he led the generals to capture La and sent him to the capital." Although it does not explicitly state Song Jiang's battle achievements, it is evident that Song Jiang participated in the suppression of Fang La. Moreover, Song Jiang is specifically listed alongside generals such as Liu Yanqing, Liu Guangshi, and Xin Qizong, indicating that Jiang's position at that time was not very low. Therefore, the novel's description has some basis and is not entirely fabricated. However, although Song Jiang once roamed Hebei, the historical records about him are not as detailed as those about Fang La. His rampant behavior was far less than that of Fang La. However, people today talk about Song Jiang and Liangshanbo, but do not mention Fang La and Zhang's influence, which is due to the embellishment and exaggeration of Song Jiang in the novel "Remnants of Xuanhe" and "Water Margin."</p>
<h3>The Burden of a Job</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>One day, I went to a small restaurant near my office to eat. I saw a young man in his twenties wearing a brand new Western suit. The tailoring of his clothes was not fashionable, and one could tell at a glance that it was made by a Western suit shop in the interior. Later, I met him several times. As time went on, I gradually became acquainted with him. I only knew that he worked as a small clerk in a company engaged in import and export business.</p>
<p>Another day, as the fine snow fell, I came out of the office and aimlessly walked into this small restaurant to sit for a while, because it also sold drinks such as milk and coffee. For convenience of writing, let's call him Mr. K.</p>
<p>I chatted with him for a while, and later Mr. K talked about his simple resume and occupation. It turned out that his ancestral home was in a remote province of China. His father was a big landlord, but he did not have much cash. After graduating from a local university, because he was unwilling to live in a small city, his family sold part of their property to send him to Shanghai to find a job and also to learn more about the world.</p>
<p>His father had many long-time friends in Shanghai, some of whom were influential figures. Therefore, he was soon placed in an import and export company and started his office life.</p>
<p>What he found inconvenient was that he was alone in Shanghai and lived in the home of a family friend. Firstly, because the journey was too far, and secondly, because living with elders inevitably restricted his daily life, so he had to find another hotel near the office. As a result, his monthly expenses were very high. It is said that he had spent about 70 million yuan, including travel expenses and pocket money, from his hometown to Shanghai. Currently, his family still had to send him 15 million yuan per month because, according to his frank admission, his monthly salary was only 3 million yuan, which was not even enough to pay for the hotel rent.</p>
<p>I suggested for him, "Could you find a cheaper hotel?"</p>
<p>He said, "Hotels in Shanghai are very expensive. When I first came to Shanghai, the rent for XX Hotel was 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per day, but now it must be more than 1 million yuan. The hotel I live in is already considered cheap."</p>
<p>I said, "If you come to Shanghai to do a big business and have a monthly income of 100 to 200 million yuan, you might as well stay at XX Hotel, but your income is only 3 million yuan, and staying at a hotel that costs 60,000 to 70,000 yuan and also having to pay for dinner seems a bit inappropriate."</p>
<p>He said, "I don't mind spending more money. I just hope to gain more experience." As he spoke, he smiled at me.</p>
<p>I thought about it for him. If he didn't have this job, he wouldn't need this expense. I used to only know the idiom "the burden of life," but now I found that there is also such a thing as "the burden of a job." So I said to him, "If you are determined to learn, you should work ten hours instead of eight. Only then will your investment not be wasted."</p>
<p>Indeed, in this kaleidoscopic metropolis, with the complexity of personnel and the constant changes in the environment, you are constantly exposed to new things. As long as you have accurate judgment and fully absorb them, you can be like a dried sponge, filled with the water of knowledge. Then, like Mr. K's example, although he may temporarily feel that his job is a burden, he will eventually reap rewards from his job one day.</p>
<h3>Talking about Sable Coats in the Cold Winter</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>As soon as winter arrives, the most fashionable clothing for women is fur coats, and sable fur is the best among fur coats. Although a coat made of high-quality seal, otter, or Persian lamb fur is more expensive than a second-rate sable coat, many people consider the latter a symbol of "nobility."</p>
<p>The sable is related to the weasel. It is said that the sable is "the most cruel and ferocious of all weasels, full of energy, and has tireless activity." Judging from the worship of sable coats by vain women, one wonders if these characteristics of the sable have been transferred to them?</p>
<p>The soft and delicate quality and the bright and clean fur are the characteristics of excellent sable fur. The color ranges from light brown to dark brown. Coats made from wild sables are sold for a lot of money. In the United States, a good sable coat is priced as high as seven thousand dollars. Even domesticated "domestic sables" are valuable, and a coat made from them can be sold for more than two thousand five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>The most fashionable is the "mutation sable" or silver-blue sable. The value of a coat made from this kind of sable is almost unbelievable. An ordinary fur coat only sells for about two hundred US dollars, but the price of a silver-blue sable coat is between thirteen thousand and sixteen thousand US dollars.</p>
<p>However, "sable coat fanatics" can go to second-hand shops to dig up their objects of worship. There, old sable coats only sell for four hundred to six hundred US dollars, and they look very new.</p>
<p>Sewing a high-quality sable coat requires many processes. An excellent fur merchant has greater talent than a craftsman; he must also be an artist. First, many pieces of fur are put together to compare the colors. Then, the whole piece of fur is cut into small pieces, carefully matched together, and then spread and fastened on a cardboard according to the shape of the coat. The next step is to nail them to the wall with about ten thousand nails and leave them there for two or three days to dry. The difference between an ordinary fur coat and a beautiful fur coat lies in this nailing and cutting technique.</p>
<p>After drying, the parts are sewn together. The next step is sampling, polishing, ironing, combing, and careful inspection. In short, it must be made into a perfect fur coat! That is, the most expensive luxury item.</p>
<h3>President Truman's Ghostwriter</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>President Truman, as the head of a country, deals with a myriad of affairs every day. In most cases, he naturally cannot spare the time to write leisurely. And Mr. Clark Clifford, who is only in his early forties this year, is President Truman's mouthpiece, typewriter, and ghostwriter.</p>
<p>Mr. Clifford has a square face, dignified appearance, curly hair, and a robust figure. At first glance, he looks quite like the British movie star Robert Montgomery. Most of the documents signed by President Truman and the speeches he delivers are written by him. The tax reduction bill passed by the United States not long ago was also drafted by Mr. Clifford.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Clifford is loyal to his duty and conscientious in his work. He handles any unfinished business in the President's hands one by one. He is not only the President's confidant but also an extraordinary confidential secretary, often holding full power to handle matters on his behalf.</p>
<p>According to the White House, the President's residence is constantly ringing with telephones every day, and official documents fly in like snowflakes. Clifford must handle them personally, replying as much as possible, so as to minimize the amount of affairs transferred to the President for handling.</p>
<p>This ghostwriter of the great President once worked under Samuel Rosenman, an aide to President Roosevelt. However, the time was quite short, and the latter was also President Roosevelt's ghostwriter.</p>
<p>When Clifford is assigned to draft a document, he must collect information, select some, and keep some for use. He dictates the first draft, and the secretary records it sentence by sentence. After that, he carefully revises the original manuscript, considering the meaning and weight of each word. Sometimes, it needs to be revised as many as ten times. After he finishes drafting, nineteen out of ten times President Truman only slightly changes the figures. Although the final draft of the speech does not have the sharpness, aggressiveness, or implicit meaning of the texts co-authored by Roosevelt and Rosenman, it is often concise, comprehensive, and easy to read.</p>
<p>Before Clifford stepped into the White House, he studied law in St. Louis in his early years and later became a lawyer in that city, quickly rising to prominence. During World War II, he served in the Navy, showing his talent and rising from lieutenant to captain. He was also supported by his old friend Wunderman, entered the Presidential Palace as a naval counselor, and was deeply appreciated by President Truman. His future is unlimited.</p>
<h3>New "Casting Love"</h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>Gunter Wulff and his beautiful girlfriend Louise took their lives like Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>Gunter, nineteen, was a pre-med student at the University of Berlin, and lived with his mother in a small apartment in the French sector of Berlin. His father was a prisoner of war remaining in the Soviet Union. While attending the university, Gunter joined the anti-Communist Social Democratic Party, but he did not give speeches or attend meetings, only helping out at home, doing schoolwork, and often seeing his girlfriend Louise.</p>
<p>Louise's father, an official of the Communist Socialist Unity Party, hated all anti-Communists. When he discovered that Gunter was a member of the Social Democratic Party, he immediately kicked him out and forbade Gunter from entering his house again.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, he received a call from a friend, and he agreed to visit that friend. So he walked to the Soviet sector of Berlin. As soon as he stepped out of the subway station, he was arrested by several secret police and put in a prison van. Coincidentally, the van overturned on the way, and Gunter escaped.</p>
<p>The next day, he reported his experience to the district branch of the Social Democratic Party. Subsequently, he was sent to the party headquarters, because there was a special department there to solve problems similar to Gunter's. After explaining to the headquarters, Gunter received a threatening letter from the Soviet sector, and then another letter, and another letter. He was afraid, he was depressed, and he ran back to his party headquarters to make a more detailed complaint. The headquarters told him that his situation was dangerous and offered to send him out of Berlin.</p>
<p>At first, he was happy to be able to leave Berlin, but then he thought of Louise—thought of his future—thought of the concentration camp. He made up his mind, put the poison in his pocket, and went to meet his forbidden lover. In the twilight hours, in the forest near Spindlersfeld, the police found Gunter and Louise, embracing each other, passing away from the world. (Translated from "Time" magazine)</p>

<p>Reply to "Shen Bao Reader"</p>
<p>As instructed, according to the Ministry of Education, it is claimed that:</p>
<p>Night schools do not have formal student status and are only considered supplementary learning.</p>
<p>The college's registration procedures have not yet been completed, and students' academic status has not been reported to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has not yet approved the college's registration, and since students' academic status has not been approved, it is even more difficult for accelerated students to have their academic status recognized by the Ministry.</p>
