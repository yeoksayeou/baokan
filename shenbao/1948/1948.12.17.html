<p>〔本報蚌埠十六日電〕蚌宿戰塲今日有重要發展，堅守雙堆集已有二十日之黃維兵團，昨夜開始突圍，一路由胡璉率領，作正面向東南方突擊，黃維則率領另部在其左側向同一方向行動。據今晚消息：突圍部隊於午後五時與此間剿總取得聯繫，兩路大軍均已抵達安全地帶，胡璉將軍乘坐坦克車內，指揮作戰，爲匪軍砲擊負傷，刻抵蚌治療。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十六日電〕據匪俘供稱：劉伯承於本月七日會飭士兵準備七天之補給，其企圖係欲於十四日以前，擊潰黃兵團；由於我健兒之奮勇喋血，黃兵團之陣地雖已縮小，但並未動搖。黃兵團能支持至十五日，實際上已粉碎匪軍之夢想，而軍事當局於此時決定黃兵團之突圍，在頑匪疲憊之餘，自屬一絕好機會。關於該部突圍之戰况，據空軍偵察報告：今日午後三時以前，空軍於澮澥兩河之間，尙未發現任何跡象，雙堆集附近甚沉寂，亦無對空軍聯絡信號，則又證明部隊之已經離開，故其時此間軍方，甚表焦慮。黃兵團突圍完成之消息，係今晚傅出者；據記者探悉，該部在雙堆集作戰二十日，其傷亡僅有二分之一，且尙包括反叛之一部，在突園過程中，損失亦微，並不影響其原有之堅强戰鬥力。</p>

<h3 id="c11">國防部發表一週戰况 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕國防部頃發表九日至十五日一週戰况於次：</p>
<p>（一）華東戰塲</p>
<p>蚌宿地區，匪我主力會戰，現在三個地區進行，一在永城以東宿縣以西地區，我方主力爲杜聿明副總司令所率領自徐州南下之兵團，該地區之匪爲陳毅所屬第一·二·三·四·八·十·十一·十三·兩廣·魯中南及快速等縱隊，我軍自十三日起，在陸空戰車密切配合下，由永城東北地區向南進擊，當將盤踞魏樓，孫閣一帶之匪三·八縱隊擊潰，十五日向困守李樓，郭樓兩大據點之匪痛擊，業已攻克，繼續南進。增援該地區匪軍爲蘇北，魯中，膠東，豫東等地軍區部隊及補充團等，大都爲新近强迫參軍之新兵，且均疲憊不堪，先後被國軍猛擊，受創奇重，數日來經宿縣北運之匪傷兵過七萬餘人，其主力刻均竄集漲溪口，苗橋，丁集（宿縣西北）一帶，喘息整補，我南下兵團正着着向南，對匪不斷進攻。</p>
<p>另一戰堪，以宿縣西南之變堆集，太營集一帶爲中心，爲國軍之黃維兵團，當面之匪，爲劉伯承匪部第一·三·四·六·十一·及陳匪第七等縱隊，總數約十萬人，以迭被我軍陸空重大打擊，損折甚重，刻劉匪攻勢已形頓挫，而圓以層層工事，阻止國軍前進，日來雙方互以大砲轟擊，我黃兵團堅强英勇，愈戰愈奮，連日出擊，已攻克週邊村莊十數處，與北上兵團之距離日益接近。</p>
<p>其次，在固鎭西南新集，包家集一帶地區，我北上大軍，正配合新銳戰車部隊，於十日越何集火神廟之綫，於十五日攻佔包家集，高家集，而造成南綫一重大進展。當面之匪，爲陳毅六縱隊，及劉伯承第二，第九縱隊之三個旅，均受創深重，潰不成軍，近自濟南以東星夜調來渤海縱隊之十一師，及蘇魯豫軍獨立團等增援，仍在節節抵抗，國軍爲把握殲匪良機，生力軍正源源加入戰塲，宿蚌地區匪軍以憲法逃脫，勢將遭受一空前慘重之打擊。</p>
<p>宿蚌會戰，自十一月廿六日開始，迄今已廿日，共斃傷俘匪十二萬餘人，向我投誠及被俘之匪亦逾四千，我鹵獲步槍四千餘支，輕重機槍二百餘挺，馬二百餘匹，國軍傷亡約四萬五千餘人，與匪成一與三之比。</p>
<p>據匪俘供稱：各綫匪軍，日來糧彈極感缺乏，後方担架民伕均已被强迫編入匪軍，輸運糧彈之馬牛車，大部被我空軍炸毀，匪軍老兵已損失二分之一以上，故士氣極消沉，目前所賴以接濟者，祗有由宿遷及洪澤湖畔及豫東地區向老百姓沒收之糧食，每日僅以少數雜糧豆類充飢，不數甚巨，故匪軍在疲乏及飢餓交織下，遇有機會，卽自願向我投誠，而國軍則空運車運補給至爲便捷，士氣亦極爲旺盛，故宿蚌地區會戰自將日趨有利。</p>
<p>（二）華北戰場</p>
<p>張垣方面，自聶榮臻匪部偷襲張垣被我軍擊退後，張垣出擊國軍十日起乘勝擴大戰果，張垣東南老虎山及張垣西北烏拉哈附近殘匪已大部南竄，竄犯新保安附近之匪，正受强大國軍猛擊，現國軍順應察省民衆要求，仍留一部駐守張垣，張垣外圍連日甚爲安謐。</p>
<p>冀東方面，國軍已完成新部署，唐出於十二日主動撤離，現已增强保衛平津塘沽三角地區，相機予匪以打擊。刻林彪入關匪部一·二·六等縱隊，竄唐山西北豐潤附近地區，三縱隊竄擾平津鐵路北段廊房地區，四·五·七·八·九·十·十一各縱隊，及獨七師各部，竄北平西北部密雲，順義及長城一帶，各該匪部現疋就地抽拉壯丁，補充兵額，登記糧食物資，尙未發生大戰，平市西郊清河·萬壽山·石景山附近，十四日起發生前哨戰，爲匪的試探擾亂，駐守各該地國軍堅强部隊，已擊退匪之流竄擾亂，平市秩序安定如恒。</p>
<p>太原方面，本週無重大戰鬥，東南綫國軍於十三日出擊，在千家墳西北擊潰匪一股，斬獲甚豐，西南綫國軍，於十四日向白家莊西南地區搜剿，匪卅八旅一部被我斃傷三百餘，此外，匪新四旅·六十九旅，及太行獨立旅等，以傷亡慘重，竄往淸源等地整補，我空軍更番飛匪後猛烈炸射，效果極佳。</p>

<h3 id="c12">社論　緊急工貸的開放 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>緊急工貸開放了，央行貼放委員會於十三日起，開始辦理各廠商工資申請手續的審查。這次工貸的開放，據貼放委員會宣佈說，「爲適應生產及出口事業之迫切需要」，其貸款方式分爲「收購成品」及「質押放軟」兩種，並以收購爲主。關於收購成品之詳細辦法，貼放委員會十三日已開會訂定公佈，詳誌十四日本報。其關於質押放軟辦法，據說仍須透過國家行局或商業行莊，向貼放會申請，但對廠商之經營狀况及需要貸助情形，應由承做之銀行錢莊作詳細調查，最後核定貸款數額及貸出後之用途，如用於非生產途徑或其他不正當情形，概不予貸借。此項工貸貸款利率，規定比照商業行莊核定利率八折計算，央行九折轉押，轉押利率照貸款利率减低三分；至貸款期限，規定爲三十日，必要者得予展期。這個嚴密的貸款辦法，意在防止廠商套用廉價頭寸，而眞正做到救濟廠商的目的。</p>
<p>多災多難的上海工業界，數月以來遭遇到不知多少新的困難。先是在限價期內，由於政府的嚴格檢查倉庫，限止存貨及市民的爭相搶購，各廠的存底已達十分空虛的地步。就在這搶購風潮之下，上海的物資滾滾外流，而各廠商所需的原料物料，却因限價的關係而無法源源取得。爲了應付這個困局，不是停工减產，即便收縮營業，但工廠的管理費用及薪工開支，並不因此而大見减削。工資不僅未能减削，且因民生日用品物價的陡漲，生活指數不斷上升，工資也隨之遞升。另一方面，由於戰局的演變，資金大量南流，利率高昂，產品成本依然不斷增加。在此種情形下，上海工業困難重重，幾乎已面臨絕境。故如何解救上海工業這種困難問題，保全民族元氣，乃至逐步增加生產，不僅是工業界應該努力掙扎的事，而且也是政府當局不可推諉的責任。</p>
<p>上海工業會向財政部陳述這種困難，並請求當局即日先行核放緊急工貸，以挽救工業危機。工業會要求二點。（一）各廠請貸數量，准以各廠二個月之工資爲標準，總數爲十億元；（二）請以各廠房屋機器爲貸款擔保品，而不以原料及成品爲抵押。從工商業資全活潑運用上說，工業會這兩點請求，是有其聽明打算的；但政府當局爲了遏阻市塲游資的充斥與物價的騰升，自以運用『收購成品』及「質押放戲」兩種方式爲穩妥，且可以利用貸款達到促進生產的目的。工業界對於收購成品和高額利率，並不表示滿意，因爲這兩種方式對於工業活動的控制性太大了，所得的工貸祇够喘一口氣，並不能眞正促進生產。事實上，政府這次開放工貸的辦法，乃迫於工業界的呼籲，它是萬不得已的一種救濟措施，而非眞正實行一種扶助民族工業的政策。像這種類似救濟性質的工貸，正如三十四年政府在重慶所辦的緊急工貸，三十五年底的生產貸款，以及去年底陰曆年關所舉辦的收購廠商成品辦法，其精神和內容幾乎完全一致，概是一種臨時救濟性的借貸。</p>
<p>由上所述，這種臨時救濟性的工貸，祇够垂危中的廠商喘口氣，——能否喘息尙不可知，並不能眞正促進工業生產。我們覺得爲了保存在烽火中的民族工業，政府當局應有一套保全和穩定工業的辦法，製訂較爲久遠的貸款政策，藉以達到眞正促進生產的目的。誠然，開放工貸是有助長通貨膨脹作用的，但如「收購成品」的辦法運用合理，是可以防止貸軟囤積及遏止游資充斥市塲的弊端。技術上的運用，辦法尙多，克服困難亦非難事，這祗要政府當局有決心，不太重視小範團內的打算，自然會創造」條扶助民族工業的道路來。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕新聞局息：關於開放工業貸款，聞中央業已同意，惟貸款範圍將僅爲訂貨貸款，茲由財部負責方面獲悉，國家行局工業貸款，本部已決定酌予開放，其具體詳細辦法，本部正督同央行擬訂，對貸款方式并不僅限於訂貨貸款，貸款對象應從嚴釐定，貸款利率擬比照市塲利率酌予降低，貸款手續應力求簡便。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕代理國務卿羅維特本日舉行記者招待會，有就印尼局勢提出問題者，羅氏指出美國為聯合國調解委會之一負，該委會從朱停止使荷蘭與印尼共和國言歸於好之努力。有以印荷談判是否業已恢復相詢者，羅氏稱：渠並無所知，惟謂海牙來訊稱，最近印尼總理哈泰所發之照會，已使有關印尼聯邦政府之一項命令暫緩發表。（星期六，荷蘭已宣佈在調解委會之下繼續進行談判將屬「無益」，並謂荷蘭將在共和國所佔有之地區以外，成立一印尼臨時聯邦政府，惟共和國以後加入此一聯邦政府之門依然開放。）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市自衛特捐籌募委員會，業於昨日正式成立。吳國楨，杜月笙，潘公朕，徐寄廎，陳大慶等，為推動展開自衛特捐，特於昨午四時，假國際飯店十四樓舉行茶會，邀請各界人士，到劉攻芸，王曉籟，錢新之，顧竹軒，馬少荃，注竹一，謝仁釗，秦潤卿，胡西園，田禮謙等數十人。茶會由吳市長主持，主席報吿後，由潘公展，杜月笙，徐寄廎，王曉籟，馬少荃等分別致詞，卽席通過具體籌募辦法三項：（一）自明年元旦起，本市地價稅一律增收千分之五，估計可得一億二千萬圓左右。（二）工商界產品徵募勞軍損辦法，決改為徵募自衛特捐，繼續徵收。（三）限價期間本市封存物資，一律徵收其十分之一充作自衛特捐。在塲各業人士均表示願意認捐，茲錄吳市長，潘議長等於茶俞中致詞如下：</p>
<p>吳市長稱：保衛上海是整個上海市民的問題，這兩天謠言特別多，表示大家都希望安定，因此自衛是必需的。謠言的來源有二：一是人心不安，容易引起謠言，另一是匪黨故意散佈以搖撼人心。昨經本人及潘議長與中央連絡後，證實一切謠傳均屬無待，現黃李兵團業已會師，前方士氣極為旺盛，必勝信念必須樹立，則上海必可保衛。長江古稱天塹，况海空軍均在握，共匪從何而來？目今急務在於如何保衛上海，望市民以逃難資金充作自衛特捐，因保衛首需龐大經費，以目前物價估計，至少約需經費三億元左右，上海為財富之地，深信必無問題，如上海市民各盡其能，則相信不但今年舊歷年可安然度過，且明年後年及整個大局均可吿無虞。現本人提出具體意見三項：（一）土地是黃金，保衛上海亦卽保護土地，建議地價稅增收千分之五，充作救濟特捐。（二）鞏固上海，工商業才能繁榮，故望工商界能分予負担，以勞軍捐充作自衛特捐。（三）限價期間封存物資，依法而言，如無犯法行為者應予發還，但目前物價已吿上漲十餘倍，是則等於政府已代其囤積，故擬以其十分之一充作自衛特捐，俾對地方有所貢獻，亦屬合情合理，希各界人士踴躍推進。</p>
<p>潘公展對安定上海　認應加強訓練警察</p>
<p>潘議長公展致辭稱：上海是個極重要的地方，如果上海市民肯出力與政府合作，共謀自救救國之道，則不但上海能保安定，整個國家大局亦可望因此而扭轉。希望市民切勿錯過這個對國家對自己盡其責任的機會，而成為全國各地的模範。保衛上海需要經費，市長估計約需三億，惟事實上或將超出此數。昨日本人曾與各方商談如何使上海安定問題，認為首須加强訓練上海市之警察。（一）使用武器，須充分熟練；（二）保安警察人數必須充實；（三）警察待遇必須提高，使彼等生活安定，始能盡其保衛之責。本人以為，上海警政在吳市長兪局長領導之下，甚有進步，但更希望上海能樹立新風氣，以取得友邦人才之協助，例如訓練警察，必要時不妨聘請外國專家任顧問。吾國人往往有錯誤之自大觀念，認為聘請客卿卽屬妨碍主權，其實並不如是，蘇聯在幾次五年計劃實行時，均曾借才於他國，凡事總宜虛心學習才是正道。只要上海人眞能同心協力，以實際行動來表現我們自助的成績，則國際觀感必將改觀；要知欲得人助必先自助，此乃天經地義，如上海自衛工作成績斐然，則友邦日後亦必來相助。回憶一二八及八一三抗戰時期，上海人曾紛紛獻金救國，獻物勞軍，而今日反只見因擠兌金銀而阻碍交通，影響秩序，相差懸殊，深為驚歎。故本人以為兌取金銀者，亦不妨考慮附徵自衛特捐，只要收來之捐款，眞正用之於保衛人民，保衛地方，保衛國家，一切徵收辦法，都可合理推行。</p>

<p>繼杜月笙稱：要保衛地方，須加强地方武力，要建樹地方武力，地方人士有錢者當出錢，有力者出力，俟地方安定後，才能繁榮上海，若現在不願出錢，將來想求人保護，自然亦不可能，故希　各界人士合力協助，完成此舉。旋徐寄廎，王曉籟等相繼致辭，馬少荃並代表房地產業應允在地價稅中加增千分之五，其他各業亦均自願認捐，遂決定成立自衛特捐籌募委員會，今後一切有關事務，均由該會辦理之。至六時許始散。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於無證自備外匯到埠及起運貨品由政府收購應給予原進進口商作為收購代價之特種外幣存單，依照原規定須准其一律抵付進口貨款外匯，或照市價匯率兌換國幣，但其施行細則內復有原進口商優先承購之規定，因是政府收購之無證貨品，有仍由原進口商優先購回者，有商人原擬優先購回，而政府必須强制收購者，有商人中請放棄優先　回必須由政府收購處理者，條件各有不問，損益程度互異，就商業觀點言、自非採用差別待遇，不足以昭公允，經財部約集央行中信局擬定辦法，呈請政院核定，內容如次：</p>
<p>（一）强制收購或由原進口商優先承購後，已由政府指定機關向其價購者，其進口之目的旣未達到應准其以持有之外幣存單，抵付進口貨款外匯，俾仍予以進進口之機會，並齊依照施行細則，規定特種外幣存單，自上年十一月份起，得分六季抵用，茲歷時一年尙未開始抵用，原規定期限過長故其特種外幣存單，准自第八季起，分三季抵用。</p>
<p>（二）原進口商放棄優先永購，由政府收購者，其進口之目的雖未達到，但必因不利情形而放棄者，政府之收購並非强制，故雖准其以外幣存單抵付進口貨款外匯，但期限仍依原規定，自第八季起，分六季抵用。</p>
<p>（三）原進口商優先承購者，卽為變相之准許口，政府徒有收購之名，商人仍獲進口之利，故其外幣存單無須再予抵用，惟為公正起見，規定：（一）在本年六月一日以後原照牌價國幣四七四，〇〇〇元匯率繳付者，其特種外幣存單，仍按五月卅一日牌價匯率，每美金一元折合金圓一角五分八厘之五倍，一次發給金圓券，（二）在本年五月卅一日以前，照指定銀行牌價繳付價款者（尙未使用結匯證明書），其特種外幣存單，全部照現行匯率（一比二十）發給金圓公債。</p>
<p>（四）商人應繳貨在十一月十一日以前繳交及進口商之利潤，在是日以前經中信局付訖，或中信局已發付款通知，而商人故意不領者，均仍按照八一九掛牌匯率，折合國幣再折合金圓計算，其在十一月十二日以後收付者，均照上項匯率，提高五倍計算。</p>

<p>米市傾跌未已，到貨仍湧，積集不能銷盡，去路仍呆，供過於求。加之業外各物下降，人心殊疲，價降頗力。北市白粳及早薄稻各勁跌四十元，高白粳退至三百三十元，中關早稻跌至三百元邊，秈米一致降三十元。南市塲白粳挫二十元，薄稻跌二十五元，早稻亦小二十五元，陰元降二十元，二市到貨共計一萬二千一百五十六石。</p>

<p>雜糧</p>
<p>繼續下挫，米價下跌，人心不振，客胃呆木，各貨供過於求。黃豆客帮及油廠均不納，挫落十元。苞米去化呆木，下降五元至十元，紅糧酒坊不納，內地銷呆，勁跌十五至二十元。揀靑再降十元，菉豆，赤豆，一致下降，芝蔴，生仁各略疲三十元。</p>

<p>一日所得，救濟難民。</p>
<p>這次共匪圍攻徐州時，徐屬各縣市中學員生，為避免無謂犧牲，也紛紛逃來鎭江，總共有三四千人。當他們離開徐州的時候，正是烽火滿天，行李及一切衣物都倉皇丟棄，所以這一批流亡員生的情形就非常狼狽，看上去和難民們差不多。江蘇童子軍理事會的主持人，抱着一顆同情的心，卽慨然借給大屋及廚房辦公炊飯器具等盡量供應，後來看見學生人數增多，旋撐搭帳棚，解決了住的問題，該會更發動全鎭童子軍募捐，各校男女童子軍有的抬着食米，有的担着靑菜山芋，還有的提着水菓餅乾。</p>
<p>紛紛饋贈</p>
<p>他們還唱歌表演舞蹈，給這些學生聽看，流亡學生於飢寒交迫顚沛流離之餘，忽然得此同情的安慰和物質帮助，冷透的心，獲得了無限的溫暖，每個人却感激得流下淚來。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕杭市大小商民二千餘千餘人，十四日齊集市參議會前呼嘯請願，反對市府提高營業稅收及淸査營業稅辦法，情形甚為混亂，據熟悉此舉內慕之市民客觀談述事實經過構：杭市為平均市民負担，防止漏稅起見，市府擬提高營業稅約照限價期間有彈性的最高至二十倍之譜，並調查市區地價使不低於農田地價，商人營業稅使不低於公敎人員所得稅等，自係一種公正合理之揹施，詎杭市商人橫加反對，殊川意外。</p>
<p>如衆所週知，巳往杭市納稅不合情理之處甚多，如杭市棉花蛋業理事長沈志榮所設之之沈長興記，八月份僅繳五角錢，九月份繳一元五角，綢絲業理事長兼參議員程心錦所設之德太和綢莊，八月份僅繳七元五角，九月份廿二元五角，十月份四十五元，而公敎人員所繳所得稅每月竟繳五六元之多。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Important Developments in the Bengbu-Suxian Battle Situation: Huang-Li Army Corps Complete Convergence; National Army in Xiao-Yong Area Captures Gengzhuang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] When answering inquiries at a press conference on the 16th, Deng Wenyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, stated: (1) Du Yuming's troops, leading approximately 180,000 men from Xuzhou southward, and Huang Wei's army corps, still numbering 80,000 men, are still separated by 35 to 40 kilometers. Huang's forces are approximately 20 kilometers away from the Li army corps, which is advancing northward from Bengbu. (Note: According to a special dispatch from our Bengbu office, Huang's army corps broke through and reached the designated location at 5:00 PM on the 16th.) Du Yuming's southward-advancing troops are progressing at a rate of 3 to 5 kilometers per day due to enemy resistance. (2) Lin Biao's bandit troops north of Beiping number approximately seven columns, while Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops south of Beiping number approximately eight columns. Lin's bandits have another three columns near Tangshan.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] Important developments occurred in the Bengbu-Suxian battlefield today. Huang Wei's army corps, which had been defending Shuangduiji for 20 days, began to break through last night. One route was led by Hu Lian, making a frontal assault towards the southeast, while Huang Wei led another unit on his left flank in the same direction. According to tonight's news, the breakout troops made contact with the Suppression Headquarters here at 5:00 PM this afternoon, and both major forces have reached safe areas. General Hu Lian, commanding the battle from inside a tank, was wounded by enemy artillery fire and is currently receiving treatment in Bengbu.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] According to prisoner of war confessions, Liu Bocheng ordered his soldiers on the 7th of this month to prepare seven days' worth of supplies, with the intention of crushing Huang's army corps before the 14th. Due to the valiant and bloody fighting of our brave soldiers, although the Huang army corps' position has shrunk, it has not wavered. Huang's army corps' ability to hold out until the 15th has effectively shattered the enemy's dreams, and the military authorities' decision to have Huang's army corps break through at this time, after exhausting the stubborn bandits, is naturally an excellent opportunity. Regarding the battle situation of the breakout, according to air force reconnaissance reports, before 3:00 PM today, the air force had not discovered any signs between the Hui and Xie rivers. The vicinity of Shuangduiji was very quiet, and there were no air-to-air communication signals, which further proves that the troops had already left. Therefore, the military here was very anxious at that time. The news of the Huang army corps' completed breakthrough was released tonight. According to reporters, the unit suffered only one-half casualties during the 20 days of fighting in Shuangduiji, and this also includes a portion of the rebels. Losses during the breakout process were also minimal, and did not affect its original strong combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] Since Liu Zhi flew to Nanjing on the 13th to seek instructions, returned to Bengbu on the evening of the 14th, and went to the front line for inspection on the 15th, Liu's actions have shown us that there will be decisive changes in the current battle situation. According to military sources, after Yang Gancai's army joined the battlefield in front of Li Yannian, a full-scale attack was launched today. The bandits between Baojiaji and Xinji have retreated to the northwest, but Huang's army corps has already broken through. The fighting on the southern front has obviously decreased, and its importance, according to observations by military authorities, is that the National Army may henceforth hold the natural barrier of the river and defend Huainan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] On the 16th, Li Yannian's army corps fired on the bandit troops in Cui Zhuang from Gaowangji, and captured Cui Zhuang by evening. Approximately 20,000 bandits are facing Li's army corps, moving in groups of 1,000 or 2,000 towards the northwest. This was discovered by air force groups led by Deputy Commander Wang Shuming, who strafed and bombed them, inflicting heavy casualties. Also: On the morning of the 16th, 3,000 bandit troops moved from Zhao Ji towards Banqiao Ji (north of Yingshang County on the west side of the Fei River), and were heavily damaged by the discovery of the Shenying.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 16th] There will be important changes in the current battle situation. The situation here tonight is still very stable; however, there are still many people leaving for the south. Military vehicles are speeding through the streets, giving a slight sense of tension.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Military news: Huang Wei and Li Yannian's army corps converged on the afternoon of the 16th. Li's army corps attacked the bandits in front of them after capturing Baojiaji, then entered Fangdianzi and met with Huang Wei's army corps, which had launched an attack from Shuangduiji. Since the beginning of the Suxian-Bengbu battle, Huang Wei's army corps has used Shuangduiji and Dayingji as bases between the Bei Fei and Hui rivers, absorbing more than 100,000 enemy troops from Liu's 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 10th Columns, as well as Chen Geng's 7th Column, preventing them from disengaging from the battlefield. Under the intense fire and continuous bombing by our infantry, artillery, and air force, the bandits have suffered heavy losses. After being attacked by Li Yannian's army corps advancing northward, the bandits in front could no longer resist and collapsed towards Suxian in a panic.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of National Defense announced tonight that Huang Wei's 12th Army Corps has broken through the encirclement and converged with Li Yannian's 6th Army Corps northwest of Bengbu.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] From morning to evening on the 16th, air force squadrons, commanded by Deputy Commander Wang Shuming in a B-25 aircraft, carried out bombing in the Xiao-Yong area. By evening, Du Yuming's troops took the opportunity during the air raids to shell Gengzhuang, setting it on fire, and captured it.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th, 7:00 PM] There has been no major fighting on the outskirts of Beiping. Although a large number of enemy troops have gathered in the suburbs, they have only engaged in small-scale harassment. The National Army is concentrated on defending the city. Last night, a portion of the enemy troops harassed the Luodaozhuang area in the new urban district again. The National Army launched an attack overnight and cleared the area by this morning.

<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th, 8:01 PM] At 7:00 AM this morning, National Army troops on the outskirts of Beiping launched a proactive attack, launching a fierce offensive along the line from Haidian in the northwest to Luozhuang in the west of Fengtai in the southeast. Infantry and artillery coordinated with the military, engaging in fierce fighting with the enemy in the Tiancun, Babaozhuang, Yamenkou, Dongran, and Xiran areas west of Beiping. By 11:00 AM, the enemy had suffered heavy losses. The fighting subsided in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th, 9:00 PM] Military news: Lin Biao's main force has been discovered near Majuqiao in the southeast and Mentougou in the southwest of Beiping. Officials have hinted that major battles may occur in the suburbs of Beiping in the near future.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th, 8:01 PM] Small groups of enemy troops harassed the area between Tongxian and Shuangqiao east of Beiping last night and this morning, resulting in sporadic fighting with National Army outposts. The situation has now returned to calm.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 15th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: On the morning of the 15th, the National Army in Beiping, with the coordination of infantry, artillery, and air force, launched a fierce attack in two routes against Lin Biao's 5th Column in the western suburbs. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. By 1:00 PM, the enemy had retreated to the northwest. There are no traces of the enemy in Tiancun, Banbidian, Luodaozhuang, Shifangyuan, and other places within 30 li outside Fuxingmen.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 15th] On the night of the 15th, electricity and running water were partially restored in Beiping.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 16th] As the fighting approaches the city of Beiping, the Yuanhe Garden and Yenching University, Tsinghua University and other places in the northwest suburbs have been abandoned. Last night, it was heard that the Communist army was only 2,000 yards from Xizhimen, and clear gunfire could be heard in the city. At the same time, it was heard that Fengtai and Mentougou had also been abandoned. Senior personnel from the Shijingshan power plant have evacuated to the city, and there is no electricity in the city at night. Candles and kerosene lamps are used for lighting. Although Beiping is within artillery range, the Communist army has not fired a single shell into the city. Famous scenic spots in the western suburbs, such as the Wanshengyuan and Biyun Temple, have been occupied by the Communist army. The Lugou Bridge and Wanping County have also fallen into the hands of the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 16th, 8:01 PM] Lin Biao's troops launched an attack on the Beicang Railway Station east of Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 16th. The defending troops fiercely resisted. By 11:00 AM, more than 300 enemy troops had broken into the station. The National Army fought back bravely, engaging in close-quarters combat, annihilating most of the invading enemy troops in two hours of fighting. Fighting is still ongoing in Beicangzhen.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 16th] The situation in Tianjin and Tanggu remains very stable. Small groups of enemy troops were discovered in Ninghe, Panzhuang, northeast of Tianjin, at noon on the 16th. The National Army attacked them, and after a brief engagement, the enemy was repelled. Trains north of Tianjin passed Yangcun and arrived at the Douzhangzhuang Bridge on the 16th.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, discussed the "attitude of the US government towards the situation in China" with the US Acting Secretary of State, Lovett, for half an hour this afternoon. It is reported that Ambassador Gu inquired of the US Acting Secretary of State about the report that the United States and other major powers would discuss the situation in China. During the half-hour meeting, the ambassador inquired again about the attitude of the United States towards future American assistance to China. Ambassador Gu told reporters after the meeting that he had asked Lovett to clarify the US attitude towards China. Regarding the report that the United States had consulted with other major powers, the British Ambassador Franks had discussed the emergency situation in China with Lovett for about an hour on November 16th. Ambassador Gu apparently asked to clarify the statement made by Hoffman in Shanghai. However, when asked whether Hoffman's statement had been discussed, Ambassador Gu replied, "Mentioned occasionally." He said: His meeting with Lovett was very satisfactory, and the discussion was thorough. Asked whether he had requested further assistance to China when the funds allocated for current needs were used up, he said that half of this allocation had been used, and that they were now working to make all those who purchased materials from the American purchasing agencies into actual suppliers of materials to China.

(2) Mr. Gu indicated that his forwarding to the United States Congress the Chinese Control Yuan's appeal for aid to China was a "routine" matter. (3) He is working to make funds under the $125 million military aid plan for China become "actual supplies." (4) He does not know when Madame Chiang will return to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Madame Chiang is still staying at Marshall's villa. Her future plans in the United States are unknown to both the Chinese Embassy officials and the State Department. Therefore, it has aroused various speculations.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Ministry of National Defense Releases Weekly War Report <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of National Defense has recently released the weekly war report from the 9th to the 15th as follows:</p>
<p>(1) East China Theater</p>
<p>In the Bengbu-Suxian area, our main forces and the communist bandits are engaged in a major battle, currently taking place in three areas. One is in the area east of Yongcheng and west of Suxian, where our main force is the army corps led by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming, moving south from Xuzhou. The communist bandits in this area are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, Liangguang, Luzhongnan, and Rapid Columns belonging to Chen Yi. Starting from the 13th, our troops, in close coordination with land, air, and tanks, launched a southward attack from the northeast area of Yongcheng, and routed the 3rd and 8th Columns of bandits entrenched in the Weiliu and Sunge areas. On the 15th, they fiercely attacked the bandits stubbornly defending the two major strongholds of Lilou and Guolou, and have already captured them, continuing their southward advance. Reinforcements for the bandit forces in this area are military region troops and supplementary regiments from northern Jiangsu, central Shandong, Jiaodong, eastern Henan, and other places, most of whom are newly conscripted soldiers recently coerced into service, and are all exhausted. They have been fiercely attacked by the National Army one after another and suffered heavy casualties. In the past few days, more than 70,000 wounded bandits have been transported north through Suxian. Their main force is currently concentrated in Zhangxikou, Miaoqiao, and Dingji (northwest of Suxian), catching their breath and reorganizing. Our southward army corps is steadily advancing south, constantly attacking the bandits.</p>
<p>Another battle area, centered around the Bianduiji and Taiyingji areas southwest of Suxian, is the Yellow We Corps of the National Army. The bandits facing them are the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 11th Columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit force, and Chen's 7th Column, totaling about 100,000 men. Due to repeated heavy blows from our army's land and air forces, they have suffered heavy losses. Currently, Liu's offensive has been thwarted, and they are building layers of fortifications to prevent the National Army from advancing. In recent days, both sides have been shelling each other with heavy artillery. Our Yellow Corps is strong and brave, fighting more and more fiercely, and has launched attacks for several consecutive days, capturing more than a dozen surrounding villages, and the distance from the northward army corps is getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in the area around XInji and Baojiaji southwest of Guzhen, our northward army, in coordination with newly-equipped tank units, crossed the Heji Huoshenmiao line on the 10th and captured Baojiaji and Gaojiaji on the 15th, creating a major breakthrough on the southern front. The bandits facing them are the 6th Column of Chen Yi and three brigades of Liu Bocheng's 2nd and 9th Columns, all of whom have suffered heavy losses and have been routed. Recently, the 11th Division of the Bohai Column and independent regiments of the Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan Army, etc., have been urgently transferred from east of Jinan to reinforce them, and they are still resisting step by step. In order to seize the good opportunity to annihilate the bandits, fresh troops are constantly joining the battlefield. The communist bandit forces in the Suxian-Bengbu area are trying to escape, and will inevitably suffer an unprecedentedly heavy blow.</p>
<p>The Bengbu-Suxian campaign began on November 26th and has lasted for 20 days. A total of more than 120,000 bandits have been killed, wounded, or captured. More than 4,000 bandits have surrendered to us or been captured. We have seized more than 4,000 rifles, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 200 horses. The National Army has suffered approximately 45,000 casualties, a ratio of one to three with the bandits.</p>
<p>According to the confessions of captured bandits, the bandit forces on all fronts have been experiencing a severe shortage of food and ammunition in recent days. The stretcher bearers and civilian laborers in the rear have all been forcibly incorporated into the bandit army. Most of the horse and ox carts transporting food and ammunition have been destroyed by our air force. More than half of the veteran soldiers of the bandit army have been lost, so morale is extremely low. Currently, the only supplies they rely on are the grain confiscated from the people in Suqian, the Hongze Lake area, and eastern Henan. They only eat a small amount of miscellaneous grains and beans every day, which is not a large amount, so the bandit army is suffering from fatigue and hunger. Given the opportunity, they will voluntarily surrender to us. The National Army, on the other hand, has convenient air and vehicle transportation for supplies, and morale is very high, so the battle in the Suxian-Bengbu area will become more and more favorable.</p>
<p>(2) North China Theater</p>
<p>In the Zhangjiakou area, after Nie Rongzhen's bandit forces launched a surprise attack on Zhangjiakou and were repelled by our army, the National Army launched an attack from Zhangjiakou on the 10th to expand the results of the victory. The remnants of the bandit forces near Laohushan in the southeast of Zhangjiakou and Wulaha in the northwest of Zhangjiakou have mostly fled south. The bandits who fled to the vicinity of Xinbaoan are being fiercely attacked by the powerful National Army. Now, the National Army, in response to the demands of the people of Chahar Province, is still leaving a unit to garrison Zhangjiakou. The periphery of Zhangjiakou has been very peaceful in recent days.</p>
<p>In the eastern Hebei area, the National Army has completed a new deployment. Tang was actively evacuated on the 12th and has now strengthened the defense of the Pingjin-Tanggu triangular area, waiting for an opportunity to strike the bandits. Currently, the 1st, 2nd, and 6th Columns of Lin Biao's bandit forces that entered the pass are scurrying near Fengrun in northwestern Tangshan. The 3rd Column is harassing the Langfang area in the northern section of the Pingjin Railway. The 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Columns, and the 7th Independent Division, are scurrying in the Miyun, Shunyi, and Great Wall areas in the northwest of Beiping. Each of these bandit units is now drafting men on the spot to replenish their numbers and registering grain and supplies. No major battles have occurred yet. From the 14th, skirmishes have occurred in the vicinity of Qinghe, Wanshoushan, and Shijingshan in the western suburbs of Peiping, as the bandits are probing and disrupting. The strong National Army units stationed in these areas have repelled the bandit's disruptive raids. The order of Peiping is as stable as ever.</p>
<p>In the Taiyuan area, there have been no major battles this week. The National Army on the southeastern front launched an attack on the 13th and routed a bandit force northwest of Qianjiafen, with a great harvest. The National Army on the southwestern front searched and suppressed the area southwest of Baijiazhuang on the 14th. A part of the 38th Brigade of bandits was killed or wounded by us, totaling more than 300 men. In addition, the 4th New Brigade, 69th Brigade, and Taihang Independent Brigade, etc., have suffered heavy casualties and have fled to Qingyuan and other places for reorganization. Our air force has repeatedly flown over the bandit's rear and carried out fierce bombing and strafing, with excellent results.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Editorial: Opening of Emergency Industrial Loans <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Emergency industrial loans have been opened, and the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee began reviewing the applications of various manufacturers for wage loans on the 13th. The Rediscount Committee announced that the opening of this industrial loan is "to meet the urgent needs of production and export business." The loan method is divided into two types: "purchasing finished products" and "pledging and releasing soft loans," with purchasing as the main method. The detailed method of purchasing finished products has been formulated and announced by the Rediscount Committee on the 13th, as detailed in this newspaper on the 14th. Regarding the method of pledging and releasing soft loans, it is said that it still needs to be applied to the Rediscount Committee through national banks or commercial banks and money houses, but the operating conditions of the manufacturers and the need for assistance should be thoroughly investigated by the undertaking bank or money house. Finally, the amount of the loan and its use after the loan are approved. If it is used for non-productive purposes or other improper circumstances, no loan will be granted. The interest rate of this industrial loan is stipulated to be calculated at 80% of the interest rate approved by commercial banks and money houses, and the Central Bank will rediscount it at 90%, with the rediscount rate reduced by three points from the loan interest rate; the loan term is stipulated to be 30 days, which may be extended if necessary. This strict loan method is intended to prevent manufacturers from using cheap funds and truly achieve the purpose of rescuing manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai industrial community, which has suffered many disasters, has encountered many new difficulties in recent months. First, during the price control period, due to the government's strict inspection of warehouses, restrictions on inventory, and the public's scramble to purchase goods, the reserves of various factories have reached a very empty state. Under this buying frenzy, Shanghai's materials flowed out in torrents, but the raw materials needed by various manufacturers could not be obtained steadily due to the price controls. In order to cope with this dilemma, they either stopped work and reduced production, or even reduced operations, but the factory's management expenses and salary expenses were not greatly reduced as a result. Not only were wages not reduced, but also because of the sharp rise in the prices of daily necessities, the cost of living index continued to rise, and wages also increased accordingly. On the other hand, due to the evolution of the war situation, a large amount of funds flowed south, interest rates were high, and product costs continued to increase. Under these circumstances, Shanghai industry faced many difficulties and was almost facing a desperate situation. Therefore, how to solve this difficult problem of Shanghai industry, preserve national vitality, and even gradually increase production, is not only something that the industrial community should strive to do, but also a responsibility that the government authorities cannot shirk.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Association stated this difficulty to the Ministry of Finance and requested the authorities to immediately approve emergency industrial loans to save the industrial crisis. The Industrial Association requested two points. (1) The amount of loans requested by each factory should be based on the wages of each factory for two months, with a total amount of 1 billion yuan; (2) Please use the factory's houses and machines as collateral for the loan, instead of raw materials and finished products. From the perspective of active use of industrial and commercial capital, these two requests from the Industrial Association have their clear intentions; however, in order to curb the abundance of speculative funds in the market and the rise in prices, the government authorities should use the two methods of "purchasing finished products" and "pledging and releasing soft loans" as a prudent measure, and can use loans to achieve the purpose of promoting production. The industrial community did not express satisfaction with the purchase of finished products and high interest rates, because these two methods have too much control over industrial activities, and the industrial loans obtained are only enough to take a breath, and cannot truly promote production. In fact, the government's opening of industrial loans this time was forced by the appeals of the industrial community. It is a kind of rescue measure that is a last resort, rather than truly implementing a policy to support national industry. This kind of industrial loan similar to rescue is just like the emergency industrial loan that the government handled in Chongqing in 1945, the production loan at the end of 1946, and the method of purchasing finished products from manufacturers at the end of last year's lunar New Year. Its spirit and content are almost completely consistent, and they are all temporary rescue loans.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this kind of temporary rescue industrial loan is only enough for manufacturers in critical condition to take a breath—whether they can breathe is still unknown—and cannot truly promote industrial production. We believe that in order to preserve the national industry in the flames of war, the government authorities should have a set of methods to preserve and stabilize industry, formulate a longer-term loan policy, so as to achieve the purpose of truly promoting production. It is true that the opening of industrial loans has the effect of fueling inflation, but if the method of "purchasing finished products" is used reasonably, it can prevent the drawbacks of hoarding with loans and curbing the abundance of speculative funds in the market. There are still many methods for technical application, and overcoming difficulties is not difficult. As long as the government authorities are determined and do not pay too much attention to small-scale plans, they will naturally create a path to support national industry.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] News Bureau news: Regarding the opening of industrial loans, it is reported that the central government has already agreed, but the scope of the loans will be limited to order loans. It is learned from the responsible department of the Ministry of Finance that the Ministry has decided to appropriately open the industrial loans of national banks and bureaus. The specific detailed methods are being formulated by the Ministry in conjunction with the Central Bank. The loan methods are not limited to order loans, the loan targets should be strictly defined, the loan interest rate is proposed to be appropriately reduced compared to the market interest rate, and the loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 16th] The 17th is the anniversary of Peking University. Before leaving Peiping, Hu Shih hastily wrote a commemorative speech, which roughly stated: Peking University is 50 years old. Peking University is the formal successor to the Imperial College of past dynasties, but Peking University is unwilling to admit that it is the successor to the Imperial College since Emperor Wu of Han.

Hu Shih finally said: Now we are again in a very dangerous and difficult environment, celebrating the 50th birthday of Peking University. I use a very heavy heart to describe its eventful history, and bless it with long life and health.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 6:35 PM on the 16th] Peking University started its anniversary program today amidst the sound of cannons.

<p>[News Report] Washington Broadcasting: US Deputy Attorney General Pullman formally notified the Supreme Court today, stating: US courts have no right to accept appeals from Japanese war criminals already judged by international tribunals. Mr. Pullman, from the standpoint of the government's executive branch, expressed the US government's deep concern about this matter, believing that if the Supreme Court rashly accepts appeals from Japanese war criminals, it will inevitably lead to international disputes and extremely unpleasant consequences. Even the activities of the United Nations organization will be adversely affected, because the various activities of the United Nations organization require harmonious cooperation among countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] The US government today earnestly requested the Supreme Court not to interfere with the Far East Tribunal's judgment on seven Japanese war criminals, on the grounds that if the Supreme Court interferes, it will be overstepping the Far East Tribunal's privileges, and the result will be to undermine any peaceful and reasonable resolution of international disputes and damage the activities of the United Nations organization. Deputy Attorney General Pullman was ordered to appear in court today to argue, requesting the court to reject the appeals of the Japanese war criminals. The court heard arguments for three hours today and scheduled a continued hearing on the 18th, or may pronounce judgment. If no judgment is pronounced, it will be held again on January 3 next year.</p>

The Far East Commission convened a special meeting to discuss the matter after receiving inquiries from the US Department of Justice, and unanimously voted to express the above attitude.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to a United Press report regarding the Japanese war criminals' appeal, after the US Supreme Court's hearing on the 16th (Shanghai time 2:00 AM on the 17th), according to the usual practice for hearing cases, the verdict will not be announced until the 20th. Therefore, the final decision will be known in Tokyo on the morning of the 21st.</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 15th] At a press conference on the 15th, US Military Commander in Germany General Clay was asked if the US Supreme Court's self-proclaimed right to accept appeals from criminals sentenced by the Far East International War Crimes Tribunal would have any impact on the recent judgments of the Nuremberg US Military Tribunal.

<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] A spokesman for the US delegation said today that the United States may call on the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Indonesian issue. There is a good opportunity to discuss this case when the Security Council meets on the 17th.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 16th] The Dutch government today denied that Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta's recent note could serve as the basis for resuming Dutch-Indonesian negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 15th] It is heard that the Dutch government has received a new note from the US State Department regarding the Indonesian issue, the content of which believes that the Dutch-Indonesian dispute can still be resolved through negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Mediation Group. The US Embassy has not yet confirmed this news. The Dutch cabinet has been discussing the Indonesian issue for three days, but no decision has been made yet.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 15th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett held a press conference today. When asked about the Indonesian situation, Lovett pointed out that the United States is one of the members of the United Nations Mediation Committee and is making efforts to stop the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia from becoming friends again. When asked whether Dutch-Indonesian negotiations have been resumed, Lovett said: He did not know, but said that news from The Hague said that the recent note issued by Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta has temporarily suspended the issuance of an order related to the Indonesian Federal Government. (On Saturday, the Netherlands announced that continuing negotiations under the Mediation Committee would be "useless" and said that the Netherlands would establish a temporary Indonesian Federal Government outside the areas occupied by the Republic, but the door for the Republic to join this Federal Government would remain open.)</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Yogyakarta, 16th] The Republic of Indonesia issued a communique today, emphasizing that a peaceful resolution of the dispute between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia is the only way, because the United Nations Mediation Committee has failed to complete its desired hopes, which is now obvious. The communique also stated that the Netherlands, which decided to establish a temporary Indonesian Federal Government, did not comply with the Renville Agreement, took actions contrary to the Security Council resolution of August 1, 1947, and has been unwilling to work with the Mediation Committee since October. The communique refuted the Netherlands' attacks at length.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Soviet Spies Steal Secret Documents, Second Batch Announced, Soviet Spies Pay Attention to US Foreign Policy <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] The House Un-American Activities Committee released the second batch of 26 State Department documents stolen by Soviet spies on the 16th. The documents revealed that State Department officials secretly concealed US trade negotiations with Hitler before the 1938 election to alleviate the Democratic administration's political unease. It is said that one of the documents was personally transcribed by Hiss. This is equivalent to the fact that the State Department archives were stolen by a Red spy ring ten years ago. In addition to the above-mentioned secret, it also shows (1) that the spy ring's interest was concentrated on the US's foreign policy towards the two major continents of Europe and Asia; (2) that six months before the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, the State Department obtained the secret of Hitler's plan to conquer Czechoslovakia; and (3) that French officials believed in early 1938 that the US and Japan would inevitably go to war. These documents were all submitted to the Non-American Activities Committee by Chambers, a defector communist writer. Chambers said that this is part of the two hundred documents that Hiss stole while working in the State Department and handed over to him. The State Department has not elaborated on the trade negotiations with Germany in 1938. However, according to diplomatic sources, these secret negotiations did take place in mid-1938. According to reports, when Germany insisted on placing the trade agreement on a barter system, then Secretary of State Hull decided to suspend the negotiations. In the 21 documents that have already been released, it is known that two of them have been confirmed to be handwritten by Hiss.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] Alger Hiss, a former State Department policy planner, was sentenced to perjury by a federal judge on the 15th. He was accused of handing over secret State Department documents to Chambers for delivery to the Soviet Union. Due to legal regulations, the federal judge's 18-month investigation of pre-war Communist spy cases should end today. The judge ruled six hours before the end of the period that Hiss was guilty of two counts of perjury. Because of the legal limitations of a three-year term, the federal judge could not sentence Hiss for espionage. The verdict stated that Hiss was lying when he testified that he had not handed over government documents to Chambers and that he had not seen Chambers since January 1, 1937. Prosecutor McGohey said: "We can prove that Hiss was lying when he said that he had never handed over these documents to Chambers. All we need to prove is that he was lying, not that he handed over secret documents." The maximum penalty for the above two counts of perjury is five years in prison and a fine of US$2,000 each. The House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington said that this verdict "ends one stage of our investigation into Communist spy cases."</p>

<h3 id="e57">Defending Shanghai Requires 300 Million in Funds; Agreement on Three Measures for Raising Self-Defense Special Tax; All Sectors Generously Pledge Donations at Tea Party <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Self-Defense Special Tax Fundraising Committee was formally established yesterday. Wu Guozhen, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiluan, Chen Daqing, and others, in order to promote the launch of the self-defense special tax, held a tea party at 4 PM yesterday on the 14th floor of the International Hotel, inviting people from all walks of life, including Liu Gongyun, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Gu Zhuxuan, Ma Shaoquan, Zhu Zhuyi, Xie Renzhao, Qin Runqing, Hu Xiyuan, Tian Liqian, and dozens of others. Mayor Wu presided over the tea party. After the chairman's report, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiluan, Wang Xiaolai, Ma Shaoquan, and others delivered speeches respectively. Three specific fundraising measures were immediately passed: (1) Starting from New Year's Day next year, the city's land value tax will be increased by 0.5%, estimated to yield around 120 million yuan. (2) The method of collecting donations from the industrial and commercial sectors to support the troops will be changed to collecting self-defense special tax, and the collection will continue. (3) Goods sealed during the price control period in this city will be subject to a 10% levy as a self-defense special tax. People from all sectors present at the scene expressed their willingness to donate. The speeches of Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and others at the tea party are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mayor Wu stated: Defending Shanghai is a matter for all Shanghai citizens. There have been many rumors these past two days, indicating that everyone hopes for stability, so self-defense is essential. There are two sources of rumors: one is the anxiety of the people, which easily leads to rumors, and the other is the intentional spreading of rumors by the communist bandits to shake people's hearts. After I and Speaker Pan contacted the central government yesterday, it was confirmed that all rumors were unfounded. The Huang-Li corps has already joined forces, and the morale of the troops at the front is extremely high. A belief in victory must be established, and then Shanghai can be defended. The Yangtze River has long been known as a natural barrier, and with the navy and air force in our hands, how will the communist bandits come? The urgent task now is how to defend Shanghai. I hope citizens will use their escape funds as self-defense special taxes, because defense requires huge funds. Based on current prices, it is estimated that at least 300 million yuan will be needed. Shanghai is a land of wealth, and I believe there will be no problem. If all Shanghai citizens do their best, I believe that not only can we safely get through this Lunar New Year, but also next year, the year after, and the entire situation can be without worry. I now propose three specific suggestions: (1) Land is gold, and defending Shanghai is also protecting land. I suggest increasing the land value tax by 0.5% to be used as a special relief tax. (2) Consolidating Shanghai will allow industry and commerce to prosper, so I hope that the industrial and commercial sectors can share the burden and use the troop support donations as self-defense special taxes. (3) Goods sealed during the price control period, according to the law, should be returned if there is no illegal activity, but current prices have risen more than tenfold, which is equivalent to the government hoarding them on their behalf. Therefore, I propose that 10% of them be used as a self-defense special tax to contribute to the local area, which is also reasonable. I hope people from all walks of life will actively promote this.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan Believes Strengthening Police Training is Necessary to Stabilize Shanghai</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Gongzhan said in his speech: Shanghai is a very important place. If the citizens of Shanghai are willing to work together with the government to seek self-rescue and national salvation, not only can Shanghai maintain stability, but the entire national situation can also be turned around. I hope citizens will not miss this opportunity to fulfill their responsibility to the country and to themselves, and become a model for the rest of the country. Defending Shanghai requires funds. The mayor estimates that it will require about 300 million, but in fact, it may exceed this amount. Yesterday, I discussed with various parties how to stabilize Shanghai and believe that it is first necessary to strengthen the training of the Shanghai police. (1) The use of weapons must be fully proficient; (2) The number of security police must be increased; (3) Police salaries must be raised so that they can live in stability and fulfill their duties to defend. I believe that under the leadership of Mayor Wu and Director Yu, the Shanghai police administration has made great progress, but I also hope that Shanghai can establish a new atmosphere to obtain the assistance of talent from friendly countries. For example, in training police, it may be necessary to hire foreign experts as consultants. We Chinese often have a misguided sense of arrogance, believing that hiring foreign advisors hinders sovereignty, but this is not the case. When the Soviet Union implemented its five-year plans, it borrowed talent from other countries. It is always right to learn with an open mind. As long as the people of Shanghai can truly work together and show our self-help achievements with practical actions, international perceptions will change. We must know that to get help from others, we must first help ourselves. This is a matter of course. If Shanghai's self-defense work is outstanding, friendly countries will definitely come to help in the future. Recalling the January 28th and August 13th wars of resistance, the people of Shanghai donated money to save the country and donated goods to support the troops. Today, we only see people rushing to withdraw gold and silver, obstructing traffic, and affecting order. The difference is vast, which is alarming. Therefore, I believe that those who withdraw gold and silver may also consider levying a self-defense special tax. As long as the collected donations are truly used to defend the people, defend the local area, and defend the country, all collection methods can be reasonably implemented.</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng Hopes People from All Sectors Will Work Together to Help Defend the Area</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng continued: To defend the area, we must strengthen local forces. To build local forces, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. Only after the area is stabilized can Shanghai prosper. If you are unwilling to contribute money now, it will naturally be impossible to ask for protection in the future. Therefore, I hope people from all sectors will work together to complete this task. Subsequently, Xu Jiluan, Wang Xiaolai, and others delivered speeches one after another. Ma Shaoquan, on behalf of the real estate industry, promised to increase the land value tax by 0.5%. Other industries also volunteered to donate. It was decided to establish a Self-Defense Special Tax Fundraising Committee, and all future related matters will be handled by the committee. The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM.</p>

Li Baixian and others, representatives of the families of the Jiangya Steamer disaster passengers, yesterday entrusted lawyer Xiao Zhenkai to send a letter to various aftermath relief agencies and fellow associations, suggesting four points: (1) Regarding the thorough investigation of the cause of the disaster, it is advocated to invite famous maritime experts, shipbuilding engineers, ship surveyors, marine engineers, responsible officials of the maritime administration, local impartial gentry, representatives of the China Merchants Bureau, and representatives of the families of the victims to form a committee to conduct an on-site inspection and impartially determine the responsibility for this destruction and sinking. However, the number of representatives of the deceased families shall not be less than 40% of the total number of attendees. (2) Corpses should not be claimed unless the family members provide conclusive evidence to prevent villains from fraudulently claiming them for profit. (3) Valuables found on the corpses should be properly preserved, but if the family members identify the physical evidence as correct, they may be allowed to find a guarantor to take them back and should not be made difficult in order to maintain property rights. (4) Before damage compensation and maritime disaster condolences are paid according to law, those victims' families who are poor, miserable, and helpless, or whose widows, orphans, and elderly are abandoned, should have their actual situation verified and receive a temporary emergency relief fund to extend their lives.</p>

<p>Zhang Hanting's motor sailboat "Jinyuanli," which risked its life to rescue more than 450 passengers from the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangya Steamer disaster, performed another righteous rescue yesterday. The ship's bow was damaged when it rescued the distressed passengers of the Jiangya Steamer a few days ago and was sent to Haimen for repairs. It set sail for Shanghai after the work was completed on the 15th. When passing through the waters of Yushan (homophone) Yangmian Wuqishan Wujiaoyu, it discovered six fishermen who had encountered a boat crash and were calling for help on Wujiaoyu. Upon seeing this, the motor sailboat ordered five strong men to drive a small boat to rescue them, and they safely arrived in Shanghai together. The six fishermen, who were in danger of being swallowed by the giant waves, were rescued. The names of the six people are recorded as follows: Yan Yuande, Hu Deren, Hu Yuede, Yu Agen, Li Shijiu, Chen Asi. According to reports, they set sail from Yangshan on the "Jinjixiang" fishing boat on the 11th of last month with fresh beltfish and went to sell them in Yiyao Yingshengxiao. Three days later, they encountered wind and waves in the waters of Yushan, the rudder broke, and the boat crashed into Wuqishan and was shattered. Of the seven crew members, the accountant Yu Ruiyue, a native of Ningbo, died. The remaining six people drifted to Wujiaoyu with the waves, climbed to the top when the tide receded, and were rescued by the "Jinyuanli" motor sailboat, allowing them to celebrate their rebirth. They are deeply grateful, it is said.</p>

Soldiers will be received upon arrival and assigned to supplementary brigades or division districts for transfer. (2) A joint army, navy, air force, logistics, police, and military police inspection brigade will be organized to be responsible for rectifying military discipline, suppressing stray soldiers, and maintaining order in public places. The brigade will be headed by Xia Lian, the commander of the Garrison Brigade, and will consist of five district teams in the east, south, west, north, and central areas, and fifteen sub-teams. Each sub-team will consist of ten people, with two members from each of the five units of the army, navy, air force, police, and military police.

The main purpose of this is to avoid troops occupying civilian housing. Commander Chen expressed close attention to the various rumors circulating in the city recently.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating Zhao Heming, the Chief of the Audit Section of the Finance Bureau, and Yang Haoran, an auditor, wearing expensive Western suits, and using documents typed on a typewriter to arbitrarily extort money from businesses under the guise of auditing.

<h3 id="e94">Ministry of Finance Plans to Formulate Handling Measures for Goods Imported Without a License and Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, Adopting Differential Treatment to Achieve Average Profit and Loss <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the special foreign currency deposit certificates that the government should give to the original importers as the price for purchasing goods arriving at the port and shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a license, according to the original regulations, they should be allowed to offset foreign exchange for import payments or exchange for national currency at the market exchange rate. However, the implementing rules also stipulated that the original importers have the right of first refusal to purchase. As a result, some of the unlicensed goods purchased by the government are still preferentially purchased back by the original importers, some merchants originally intended to preferentially purchase back, but the government must forcibly purchase them, and some merchants requested to waive the right of first refusal and must be handled by the government for purchase. The conditions are different, and the degree of profit and loss varies. From a commercial point of view, it is not fair without adopting differential treatment. The Ministry of Finance convened the Central Bank and China Trust Bureau to formulate measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For those who have been forcibly purchased or purchased by the government-designated agency after the original importer has preferentially purchased them, and the purpose of their import has not been achieved, they should be allowed to use the foreign currency deposit certificates they hold to offset foreign exchange for import payments, so as to still give them the opportunity to import. According to the implementing rules, special foreign currency deposit certificates should be used for six seasons starting from November of last year. Now that a year has passed and they have not yet started to be used, the original prescribed time limit is too long. Therefore, the special foreign currency deposit certificates will be allowed to be used in three seasons starting from the eighth season.</p>
<p>(2) For those who waive the right of first refusal to purchase by the original importer and are purchased by the government, although the purpose of their import has not been achieved, it must be due to unfavorable circumstances that they waived it. The government's purchase is not forced. Therefore, although they are allowed to use foreign currency deposit certificates to offset foreign exchange for import payments, the time limit will still be in accordance with the original regulations, and will be used in six seasons starting from the eighth season.</p>
<p>(3) Those who are preferentially purchased by the original importer are equivalent to allowing import in disguise. The government only has the name of purchase, and the merchant still obtains the profit of import. Therefore, there is no need to reuse their foreign currency deposit certificates. However, for the sake of fairness, it is stipulated: (1) Those who paid the price at the exchange rate of 474,000 yuan in national currency according to the original published price after June 1 of this year, their special foreign currency deposit certificates will still be issued gold yuan certificates at five times the exchange rate of the published price on May 31, at 1 jiao 5 fen 8 li per U.S. dollar in gold yuan, in one lump sum. (2) Those who paid the price at the designated bank's published price before May 31 of this year (without using the foreign exchange settlement certificate), all of their special foreign currency deposit certificates will be issued gold yuan bonds at the current exchange rate (one to twenty).</p>
<p>(4) For merchants who should pay for the goods delivered before November 11, and the profits of the importers were paid by the China Trust Bureau before that day, or the China Trust Bureau has issued a payment notice but the merchant deliberately does not collect it, they will still be calculated according to the August 19 published exchange rate, converted into national currency and then converted into gold yuan. Those who receive or pay after November 12 will be calculated at five times the above exchange rate.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Various Non-Grain Items Decline, Rice Prices Plummet, High-Quality White Rice Retreats to 330 Yuan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The rice market is still declining. Goods continue to pour in, accumulating and unable to be sold out. The path out remains sluggish, with supply exceeding demand. In addition, various non-grain items have declined, and people's hearts are exhausted, so the price has dropped sharply. White rice and early thin rice in the North City have each fallen sharply by 40 yuan, with high-quality white rice retreating to 330 yuan, and early rice in Zhongguan falling to the edge of 300 yuan. Indica rice has consistently dropped by 30 yuan. White rice in the South City market has fallen by 20 yuan, thin rice has fallen by 25 yuan, early rice has also fallen slightly by 25 yuan, and Yin Yuan has fallen by 20 yuan. The total goods arriving in the two cities totaled 12,156 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>There were both rises and falls. Initially, rice prices were reported to have fallen, and various non-grain items were also slightly down, and people's hearts were weak, so the opening price continued to be low. The opening price of Lao Che flour was 134 yuan, but then scattered households suddenly came to absorb it at a low price, and it turned strong and rose again. The closing price was 142 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than yesterday. The opening price of Bingchuan flour was 128 yuan, and the closing price was 130 yuan, which was still 7 yuan lower. Hongfeng was reduced by 3 yuan, Jiancheng was reduced by 6 yuan, and miscellaneous brands of flour were reduced by 2 to 6 yuan, depending on whether they were opened earlier or later. Wheat bran was reduced by 3 to 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<p>Continued to decline. Rice prices fell, people's hearts were not invigorated, customer demand was sluggish, and the supply of various goods exceeded demand. Yellow beans were not accepted by either the customer gang or the oil mills, and fell by 10 yuan. Corn was sluggish in sales, falling by 5 to 10 yuan. Red sorghum was not accepted by distilleries and sales in the interior were sluggish, falling sharply by 15 to 20 yuan. Picked Qing fell by another 10 yuan. Mung beans and adzuki beans consistently fell. Sesame seeds and raw peanuts were each slightly exhausted by 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Turned to circling, with narrow fluctuations. Oil mills rarely opened. Soybean oil opened at a maximum of 960 yuan and closed at 940 yuan.

<p>Raw silk for export was slightly firmer due to the rise in foreign exchange transfer certificates. People's hearts were slightly firmer, and foreign merchants reopened their inventories.

D-grade 7878 evenness was opened at 17,000 yuan, rising by 1,000 yuan. Premium spot and ordinary spot both saw currency appreciation. The asking price fell back slightly in the afternoon, but buyers were watching, and some scattered households were very eager to sell, so the market situation was chaotic.</p>

The market was not smooth, and the table first advanced and then regressed. The price then stepped down. Meiya opened in the morning with an asking price of 9,500 yuan and 9,600 yuan. Floating scattered households constantly offset, and the dealers pushed up the price, raising the asking price to 10,200 yuan. In the middle, people's hearts suddenly softened, and all parties turned away after inventorying. The market atmosphere was soft, and it instantly fell back by 500 yuan. By the close of the market, the market outside the market fell again by 300-500 yuan. The asking price was very chaotic, and the trend was weak.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Refugees in Zhenjiang Facing a Life-and-Death Crisis: Hoping for Understanding and Compassion <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by our Zhenjiang correspondent on the 13th] There are two "many" things in Zhenjiang right now: The first is many refugees, and the second is many displaced students. First, let's talk about the refugees, most of whom come from the various counties of Xuzhou, as well as Funing, Lianshui, Pi County, Shiying, Suqian, Xinghua, Huaiyin, Huaian, Dongtai, Ganyu, and Quyu, all of whom have fled in batches to this poor and desolate Zhenjiang. Zhenjiang is the transshipment point for Jiangnan and Jiangbei. As a result, Zhenjiang has suddenly increased its population so much, which is really suffering.</p>
<p>The fellow townsmen associations of various counties in northern Jiangsu in Zhenjiang jointly sent a telegram to President Sun of the Executive Yuan and Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs on the 11th.</p>
<p>Detailing the Situation</p>
<p>Appealing to everyone to do what they can to provide reclamation, work relief, and introduce occupations, etc., to effectively help the refugees. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Since arriving in the provincial capital, we have no food when hungry and no clothes when cold. We live in dilapidated temples and abandoned shrines, experiencing all the pain in the world, and are on the verge of death, with little concern. Even intermittent and sporadic</p>
<p>Partial Relief</p>
<p>Is like a timely rain in a long drought, which can't help much. Even begging for alms, rice is like pearls and firewood is like cinnamon. Everyone is unwilling to give to others, so where is there any leftover to give? We have no hope of returning to our hometown, and no way to beg for mercy. What chance do we have for survival? Rather than enduring hunger, cold, and pain, it would be better to die sooner! Human nature loves life and hates death, but now the refugees wish to die sooner, the depth of their hidden pain is clearly visible. Although the disaster area is wide, the number of people returning is still small. If everyone does what they can to provide reclamation, work relief, and introduce occupations, to disperse and support the refugees, and actively rescue them, it is not difficult. It is a pity that it has not been gradually realized to this day, causing our enthusiastic and loyal thousands of refugees to suffer unprecedented pain, and how can we not regret the desire to die quickly? It is not a pity that our refugee compatriots die, but it is related to the direction of people's hearts, which will not only make those who come feel discouraged, but also make those who have not yet come hesitant. The impact is unimaginable!"</p>
<p>The Provincial Winter Relief Committee previously launched a one-yuan donation campaign to help refugees, soliciting donations from all walks of life. Because the amount was very small, the propaganda was expanded to encourage citizens of the provincial capital to donate enthusiastically. Starting from today, six local newspapers were requested to publish promotional texts in the news section and collect donations on their behalf, which will be published daily. At the same time, five</p>
<p>Movie Theaters Donated</p>
<p>One day's income to help refugees.</p>
<p>When the 共匪 (Communist bandits) besieged Xuzhou this time, students from middle schools in various counties and cities in Xuzhou also fled to Zhenjiang to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, totaling three or four thousand people. When they left Xuzhou, the flames of war were everywhere, and they abandoned their luggage and all their clothes in a hurry, so the situation of these displaced students was very miserable, looking almost like refugees. The head of the Jiangsu Boy Scouts Council, with a sympathetic heart, generously lent large houses and kitchen equipment, providing as much as possible. Later, seeing the number of students increasing, they erected tents to solve the housing problem. The association also mobilized the Boy Scouts of the whole town to raise donations. Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts from various schools carried rice, vegetables, yams, fruits, and biscuits.</p>
<p>Gifts were given one after another</p>
<p>They also sang, performed, and danced for these students to listen to and watch. After being hungry, cold, exhausted, and displaced, the refugee students suddenly received this sympathetic comfort and material assistance, and their cold hearts gained infinite warmth. Everyone was moved to tears.</p>
<p>Later, after the Education Department and the Jiangsu Provincial Youth Guidance Office continuously requested instructions from the Ministry of Education, it was decided to establish</p>
<p>Temporary Middle Schools</p>
<p>And find ways to resume schooling in Danyang, Wuxi, Jurong and other places. As of today, the two temporary middle schools in Danyang and Wuxi have taken in more than 1,000 people, and the temporary middle school in Jurong is still starting to take in people. It is said that these students are very able to get along with all walks of life in the local area wherever they go. Events such as fighting, bloodshed, etc. will never happen, and they can set an example for all displaced schools.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Merchants and Citizens of Hangzhou Petition for Tax Reduction: A Citizen Talks About What Happened <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] On the 14th, more than 2,000 merchants and citizens in Hangzhou gathered in front of the City Council to petition against the city government's increase in business tax revenue and its business tax investigation methods. The situation was very chaotic. According to an objective account of the facts by a citizen familiar with the inside story: In order to evenly distribute the burden on citizens and prevent tax evasion, the city government plans to increase business tax by about 20 times the price limit with flexibility, and investigate the land prices in the urban area so that they are not lower than the farmland prices. The business tax of merchants should not be lower than the income tax of public school teachers. This is a fair and reasonable measure, but unexpectedly, merchants in Hangzhou have strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>As is well known, there were many unreasonable things in the past in Hangzhou in terms of tax payment. For example, Shen Changxing Ji, established by Shen Zhirong, the chairman of the cotton and egg industry council in Hangzhou, only paid five cents in August and 1.5 yuan in September. De Taihe Silk Shop, established by Cheng Xinjin, the chairman of the silk industry council and a councilor, only paid 7.5 yuan in August, 22.5 yuan in September, and 45 yuan in October, while public school teachers paid as much as five or six yuan per month in income tax.</p>
<p>This citizen familiar with the inside story added: The city government's measures to reorganize tax revenue and equalize the burden on citizens are very reasonable. In this turbulent era, the government should be able to work for the interests of the majority of people and break all inherited traditions. The people should support it. The petitioning drama in Hangzhou this time, the order of which was almost disrupted, suggests that there are others behind the scenes instigating this petitioning group, attempting to maintain their special interests and status.</p>
<p>Mayor Ren encountered this unpleasant incident at the beginning of his tenure. With Mayor Ren's youth, decisiveness, and courage to act, this petition incident will probably be the first test of Ren's democratic administration in Hangzhou.</p>
