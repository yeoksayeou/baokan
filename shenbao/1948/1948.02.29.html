<h3 id="c1">上半年國家總預算　立院會議審查通過　歲出總計九十六萬億強 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立法院廿八日晨九時半開第三四七次會議，通過「三十七年上半年度國家總預算案」，並決定將法制·外交·財政·經濟·軍事五委會聯席會之審査報吿，依會中新提意見修訂補充後，正式復行政院，會議由副院長吳鐵城主席，除總預算案外，並討論處理「懲治走私條例案」照審査修正通過。「國防部測量標設置保護條例案」，照審査修正通過。「國立蘭州圖書館組織條例案」，修正通過。「修正戡亂時期危亂國家緊急治罪條例第八條條文及特種刑事法庭組織條例草案案」，重付審査。最後通過委員鍾天心臨時動議，下次會議時請關係當局報吿勝利兩年餘全部美援數額及運用經過，十二時半宣吿散會。「公營事業工會法草案案」，移下次會討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立法院今審査通過之卅七年上半年度國家總預算，共分普通與特別兩部門，總計國幣九十六萬二千七百餘億元。</p>
<p>歲出普通部門計廿六萬六千餘億元，其所佔百分比如次：（一）國防經費，約百分之卅九。（二）普通政務經費，約百分之廿七。（三）敎育科學文化經費，約百分之十三。（四）經濟交通經費，約百分之二。（五）債劵支出，約百分之十四。（六）其他，約百分之二（以上數字之小數均未列入）。</p>
<p>歲出特別部門計六十九萬六千六百餘億元，其中：（一）調整生活補助費及副秓費準備金佔百分之四十五。（二）國防經費佔百分之卅一，（三）交通經費佔百分之五（以上數字之小數均未列入）。</p>
<p>設特刑法庭案決議重付審查</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立法院廿八日會中討論「修正戡亂時期危書國家緊急治罪條例第八條條文及特種刑事法庭組織條例章案」時，各委員紛紛發言，堅決反對特刑法庭獨立設立，使行憲伊始之完整司法制度又遭此種特殊機構破壞。該案首由法制委員會委長劉克備報吿審査經過及特刑法庭組織條例草案修正要點，並謂：初步審査意見本擬將特刑法庭附設於必要地區高院之下，然以顧及軍法機構，乃更決定維特獨立設立之原則。旋林彬發言，主張與審判程序法同時審査，並請注意司法權於行憲後應使盡屬司法院。孫九錄認爲，立院抗戰期間取消特刑條例曾費大力，不可使此畸型制度更形復活。漢奸案旣由普通法院管轄，內亂罪並不重於外患罪，何須特殊，渠並指出戡亂乃爲弭亂，如苛刑擾民，反足滋亂，主張在各必要地區高院中附設臨時性質之特刑法庭，受理叛匪案件。盛振爲引用英相艾德禮對中國施行新刑法看法，謂「若千國家法律文字優美，然才要者爲充分執行」。以爲特邢法庭由司法行政部及國防部軍法局會同設立，非驢非馬，破壞司法統一，主張依初步審查意見通過，至少人事方面應由司法方面單獨任用。劉不同說明特刑制度源於法西斯之義大利，違反民主潮流，主張該案重付審査。陳茹玄亦反對行憲開端有此倒退措施，尤以原草案中以司法行政部爲最高裁定機關更屬不當。陳海澄亦謂：應以附設各地高院爲原則，必要時可獨立設置，然亦必單純隸屬司法系統。至此，劉克僑復說明依「戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例，特刑法庭之設立應無問題，然對其組織及審判程序，應召集關係機關人員詳愼硏究，亦贊同重付審査」。主席吳鐵城亦以茲事於行憲司法大康則有關，應加考慮。最後全體一致通過，該案重付審査，決維司法獨立與完整。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕數達九十六萬餘億元三十七年上半年度國家總預算案，已於廿八日立法院會議中通過成立，茲誌該院審査意見報吿全文如次：</p>
<p>「行政當局歷年編造預算送院審査時間，已屆會計年度開始，或在會訂年度開始以後，　待執行，均無充分時間詳細審核，其執行結果，又未能依照法定期間編送決算，以爲審核次年度預算之參考，是以本院歷年對於預算之審査，俱不無奉行故事未能善盡職責之感，此本院同人當引爲深咎者。卅七年度上半年度預算書送院審査時間，亦巳在本年會計年度開始將及一月之後，其內容係根據各機關上年度原則預算數及追加預算數伸算數繼列，與事實需要不相符合，至爲明顯，姑就本預算所列收支數目言之，本年度上半年度預算所列支出數額龐大，收支相抵不敷甚鉅，衡以近年物價上漲趨勢及歷年預算執行結果，將來預算上之亦字，較今日所列者更不知增多若干倍，如專賴發行或借外債以資維持，前途危難寗堪設想，我國承大戰之後，繼以剿匪軍事，民困旣深，財源日涸，行政當局對於國用之籌措，固已煞費苦心，而囿於環境數衍因循，無根本改革之計劃，亦爲不可諱言之事實，本院同人深體國家當前困難，對於本美除國民參政會駐會委員會已提有意見外，茲將收支各方面應行興革及注意事項，舉例臚列如次：</p>
<p>甲：關於收入方面者：</p>
<p>（一）財政部字管各國家銀行及參右官股之中國國貨銀行，中國通商銀行，中國實業銀行，四明銀行所列盈餘收入，均應分別再予酌增。</p>
<p>（二）各攔關主管收入，其中有列數太少，甚至實際上有較上年度少列若干倍者，例如歲入歲出總預算歲入分表經常收入第十一款國有財產學息收入農林部主管中央畜牧實驗所，鄂·豫。皖區及華東區各推廣繁殖站，洮河流域及秦嶺國有林區管理處，第一經濟林塲，本年度各僅列收入一萬元，華西區，華北區，西北區，華南區及西南區等推廣繁殖站各僅列二萬元，菸產改進處僅列三萬元，又同款農林部主管華中區推廣繁殖站上年度收入爲六百萬元，本預算僅列一萬元，西北獸疫防治處上年度收入爲十萬元，本預算僅列二萬元，北平農事試驗場上年度收入爲三千萬元，本預算僅列五萬元，一年以來物價上漲若干倍，所列收入反較上年度爲少。又同款糧食部主管中國糧食工業公司僅列收入十五萬元，該公司規模廣大，何以財產孳息收入如此其少，均應分別檢討，核實增列。</p>
<p>（三）財政部主管各項稅收，尤以關稅，貨物稅及直接稅亟應澈底整頓，涓滴歸公，以裕庫收。</p>
<p>（四）本預算赤字龐大彌補之方法，應由政府從速舉辦財產登記，切實設法，使有錢者出錢，以符依照負担能力課稅之旨。</p>
<p>（五）關於美軍剩餘物資及租借物資，接收敵僞財產及物資，日本賠償物資等各處理機關，應統一合併組織，减少濫費，袪除弊端，藉增收入。所有各項售價，應核實增列，並應嚴飭主管機關，將處理情形按期公吿。</p>
<p>乙：關於歲出卞面者：</p>
<p>（一）未經立法程序設置之機關及駢枝機關，應由行政院分別檢討，予以裁撤，以節糜費。</p>
<p>（二）財政部所屬之稅務機構，組織複雜，應依照上年度本院調整簡化擬訂辦）法，送院審議。</p>
<p>（三）國防部之組織龐大複雜，應依照本阮上年度之建議，再予調整簡化。</p>
<p>（四）敎育經費依照憲法規定，不得少於百分之十五，本預算所列之敎育經着，實際上尙不及上年度之數額，應請注意設法增列。又敎育部主管歲出臨時費內第十項訓練費，半年度列一千四百零八億四千九百一十萬元，較之上年度全年所列一百九十六億三千七百零六萬元，實屬過於龐大，應請注意調整。</p>
<p>丙：關於其他者：</p>
<p>（一）據行政當局報告，物價上漲倍數遠較法幣發行數量爲大，關於發行制度亟應公開，按期公吿，解除人民心理上之疑懼，以助幣値之穩定。</p>
<p>（二）各國營事業應由行政院聘請專家詳細査核各該事業之資產及業務經營實際情况，計其盈虧，抉剔隱匿，以資整頓，而裕庫收。」</p>
<p>會中討論時，陳海澄强調政府應以最大決心征收財產稅，陳茹玄則指出，通貨膨脹結果，此應大預算僅當廿五年預算三分之二，且幾全部用於公務人員餬口，經濟方面毫無政策，公營工業成績可憐，私家廠商受限太多，全然自殺政策，如此下去，絕難　成過渡政府戡亂行憲之重大任務。鍾天心以外電報道勝利來各種方式美援總數達廿八億美金，是否確實，用途如何，均應加以審査，以為以後美援運用之借鑑。衛挺生復痛陳勝利來因政策錯誤，　費外匯，損失外匯之種切，認爲自力更生，應自政府重新樹立信用作起，僅靠外援貸款，赤　萬難彌補，此等意見亦經決定整理後，補行列入意見書中，咨請行政當局注意。</p>
<h3 id="c23">協助我國建立空軍　美機千餘架售華　華府官員透露秘密協定 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕美政府官員廿七日透露一甚長之秘密協定。根據該協定，美國以一千〇七十一架飛機供給中國，其中包括重轟炸機及戰鬥機。渠等透露，九百卅六架飛機業已交與中國國民政府，其餘一百卅五架飛機已指定於稍後之日期交與中國，其中包括B十七型三十七架，P四十七型閃電式戰鬥機四十二架，P五十一型野馬式戰鬥機五十三架，及C四十七型運輸機三架。此外尙有有價値一億七千八百萬美元之空軍器材待運往中國，其中包括配備零件。此批準備交與中國之飛機，其成本約爲美元一億三千一百萬，但售與中國之價値僅爲七百二十萬美元。此項秘密計劃，將使中國政府空軍關有重轟炸機一隊，中型轟炸機一隊，單擊戰鬥機四隊，空中運兵隊兩隊，及空中攝影偵察一隊。此項協定，係在此次大戰結束之前提出，兩國視為極秘密，須待美國保證協助中國保持及建立空軍後，始行發表。根據該協定，中國空軍約等於歐洲國家如西班牙，南斯拉夫，或土耳其空軍之實力。此批將交與中國之飛機種類，乃美國空軍曾在二次大戰中所使用者，但由於超轟炸機及噴射式飛機之發展，此類飛機，多少巳嫌陳舊。美國務院官員透露此項秘密計劃，乃在答覆共和黨議員主强以更多之軍事援助中國之要求，藍美參衆兩院共和黨議員批評國務院上週建議之五億七千萬援華計劃中僅有經濟援助。國務卿馬敬爾雖則力促國會對經濟計劃迅速採取行動，惟對美國負責以全力支持中國軍事政治或經濟一萬，却小心避免。渠廿六日吿國會委員會稱，美國軍事援華，業已較一般所知之數量遠大遠大。此語顯然係暗指秘密空軍協定而言。根據此次協定，美國除供給飛機外，並擔任訓練在美及在華之中國飛行員及技術人員。該計劃包括括訓練一千五百四十六名驚駛機師及三百六十名轟炸員一百九十二名，航海員及三千〇三十四名技衛人員。該協定於去年十二月卅一日滿期，共費去八百七十五萬美元。在該計劃滿期以後，交與中國飛機之所以延期，其一部份原因，係由於自一九四六年夏至去夏，政府曾頒布以軍火運華之命令所致。</p>
<p>又悉二美國務卿馬歇爾及軍界官員對於中國空軍之數量問題，並不十分重視。渠等僉信：最需要者厥爲改組中國之陸軍。渠等指出，軍事運輸機較之其他類型之飛機，或對中國更爲重要。因共軍夜間調動，不能成爲其掃射轟炸之活動目標。此事衹能在野戰中收效也。</p>

<h3 id="c24">凱寧的東行與對日政策　八 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>據中央社華盛頓二十六日電稱：美國政府刻正重行檢討其遠東政策，馬歇爾國務卿並已派遣政略家，即國務院政策委員會主席凱寗前往日本，調査該國的實際情證。凱氏的行程如何？其所負的任務又如何？馬帥均未透露，但是凱氏此行任務的重大，是不言可知的。據合衆社華盛頓二十六日來電稱：美國高級官員對於凱氏東京之行曾加以評論云：馬歇爾國務卿之努力促進“本復興，實由於其所得結論，認爲中國國民政府在亞洲抵抗共產主義，永不能處於具有決定性之地位；是以凱氏作日本之行，殆爲美國意欲劇烈改變其對日政策而將侵力建設日本成爲阻止蘇聯在遠東擴張勢力的堡壘之先聲。這雖是衆社外交記者的臆測之詞，未必完全可信，尤其是合衆社所稱：「美國已決定放棄其在波茨坦會議中所持主張嚴懲日本之立塲，而設法恢復日本經濟繁榮，俾能成爲在亞洲抵制共產主義的堡壘」，更不可信。但是凱氏業已啓程赴日，將與麥帥會晤，美國對日政策將發生重大的變動，是絕無疑義的。所以這些消息的傳來，我們雖然並不完全相信，但是使我們不能不引爲遠來的隱憂。</p>
<p>自日本屈膝投降以來，將近兩年有半；麥帥管制日本的政策，不能不說已獲得相當成就；但是盟軍總部對待日本，不論是對於解除日本的武裝，或是抑低日本工業水準，或是根本消除其侵略思想，終不免太寬大，太姑息，尤其是麥帥本人，對於日本的一切，不僅不稍懷疑，而且絕對相信。本報最近一年來的社論，也一再提醒麥帥，不要太信任日本；並一再勸吿美國朝野，對日應提高警覺，姑息足以養奸，在月前的情形之下日本這部侵略的列車，不久又將開動了。但是兩年半來，英國一直向着這個方向邁步，從未有所改變；自然不免令人發生美國在那裏扶助日本復興反共的印象。所以思想最穩健的政論家屬硬生敎授也要說這樣的話：「在西方民主社會有些人士心目中，今日關於對德對日和約問題之根本，巳不在如何防制德日兩國的復興，而在如何扶持而利用戰時這兩個强敵以抵制其他一個戰勝的盟國。這種思想和政策的反動，現在雖然尙沒有表現於具體的方案或公表的文件，可是從各方面已經可以看出這個傾向」。周氏這種看法，後經北大校長胡適曾加以駁斥，胡氏並率直指出：「我觀察西方民主國家的負責言論與行動，可以作三個判斷：（一）西方民主國家並沒有放棄防制德日侵略勢力復興的根本政策；（二）因爲根本不許德日兩國重行武裝，所以西方國家決不要扶持德日兩國來抵制蘇聯；（三）所謂防制德日的復興，應該解釋作盡力防制這兩國的武裝與侵略勢力的復活』。但是在一般人的腦海裏，依舊保留美國扶持日本以反對蘇聯的觀念。美國駐滬總領事卡寶德一到上海，就發表演說，糾正一般人對於美國的誤會，並鄭重聲明美國決無扶助日本成爲亞洲防共堡壘的意向。我們對於卡氏所列舉的理由，當然也深信不　，但是我們現在看到了凱氏東京之行的消息以及美國將改變謝日政策的猜測，內心的惶惑與疑懼，又復油然而起，使我們不得不向美國朝應說句話：</p>
<p>中國對日抗議，是第二次大戰的序幕，中國可反侵略戰戰的急先鋒；迨至普及全球的大戰爆發，也就是到了默亞兩地的戰爭合流之後，中國又簽字參加莫斯科三國外長會議宣言，成為世界四強之一，當時凡是有世界限光的政治外交隊，芭不認爲遠東至暴日打倒之後，就要靠戰勝的中國來做一個安定的勢力。後來到了勝利之後，美國朝野也一致希望中國成為一強大統一和平的民主國家，做遠東唯一的安定勢力，但是勝利後兩年半以來，中國因爲有共匪的弄兵作風，不謹國內未能和平統一，而且國勢日益削弱，使友邦人士大失所望，因此乃一變原來的態度，而要想扶助日本。這種看法，不僅是絕大銷詄，而且帶有非常的危險性。中國目前的情形，可以說是共匪弄兵作亂所贊成的暫時現象，現在春國朝野下在戰力同心戡亂剿匪，當不難於最短期間敉平戰亂，建立和平民主的新中國，負起對於遠東和平所負的特別責任。所以美國要扶持日本，不僅忽視中國在遠東的重要性，而且他們的眼光也不免汰近視了。</p>
<p>即使人們再退一步說，假定中國不可救藥，美國的扶持日本的政策，也是不會得成功的。我們不必說述理由，就是在馬帥本人，也知之接諗。前週美國國會討論援華法案時，馬帥也承認，中國東北戰局的惡化，足以影響美國在日本及朝鮮的地位。要之美國不欲維持遠東和平則已，否則除了援助中國復興建國成為遠東的一大安定勢力面外，蠅無其他途徑可循，美國若要扶助日本，則無異於放棄康莊大道而偏要走羊腸小徑。其結果必致自討苦吃！</p>

<p>〔聯合社芬京廿八日電〕今日確悉，巴西基維總統巳請國會各黨對於史達林要求締結聯防條約一節，在下星期二以前表明態度。各黨現已開始討論史氏建議之談判程序。蘇聯致芬蘭之照會可望於星期一左右作為外交問題列入國會議程。</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基廿八日電〕芬蘭總統巴西基維及芬蘭內閣今日開會討論蘇聯於本週四向芬政府提出照會，要求芬蘭與蘇聯締結軍事互助協定之事。據本社期德哥爾摩電稱，該地政界人士認蘇聯之要求芬蘭採取一切可能的措施以締結此一條約，不管為對芬蘭國會所頒之指令，藍芬蘭憲法規定，芬總統或政府未經國會充分辯論後特許，不得與外國締結軍事條約。芬國會諸黨中雖僅有佔有四十九席計全部席數五分之一之人民民主同盟，（按即共然與左翼社民黨之同盟）贊成與蘇聯締結軍事協定，然其他各黨莫不一致認為維　對蘇良好關係計，有接受蘇聯要求之必要。故料國會之批准授機政府與蘇締結軍事互助協定，殆爲必然之事。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社海爾辛基廿八日電〕蘇聯政府致　芬蘭政府請締結兩國友好互助協定，消息靈通方面皆信芬政府必予贊同，芬代表團不日將前往莫斯科開始談判。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敎廿七日電〕倫敦觀察家認爲蘇聯要求芬蘭與其締結軍事互助條約，不僅爲外交上的接治，以謀締結同盟條約，實爲其機密設計的軍事計劃之一部。蘇聯素視芬蘭爲要塞，苟不能由蘇控制，即將爲他人進攻蘇聯之跳板。蘇聯提出要求並未使此間人士感覺驚奇，蓋去年十一月芬政府代表團之赴莫斯科，即已爲蘇芬間將有新發展之先聲，而蘇駐芬新大使薩伏尼柯夫中將之於上月抵芬，益足使人相信戰後蘇芬關係之新階段業已開始。芬蘭雖爲蘇聯勢力圈內之國，然迄至目前爲止，尙能享受莫斯科對其鄰邦中比較最自由的待遇，其故乃在蘇聯之不欲過於驚愕，斯坎的那維亞諸國，驅之入西方團家懷抱故也。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英外部發言人稱英國對捷克斯拉夫的政策，已由英政府在全盤檢討中。發言人並向記者宣讀一九二〇年第二共產國際大會中共黨之宣言，其中有云，共產主義固定的目標，在破壤議會政府。共黨之參加議會，不在從事建設性任務，乃在使其得自內部摧毁布爾喬亞國家的議會制度。發言人指出英政府認爲此項宣言，乃共黨在捷克所取戰略極準確的分析。</p>
<p>〔中央社弗朗克福廿七日合衆電〕捷克政界流亡人士稱，捷克之秘密軍隊業已動員，與祖國之共產主義作戰。據稱，捷克人民將使用在戰時納粹佔領下所學習之地下戰術。渠等稱，反共捷克中央委員會或將在國外成立。</p>

<p>〔路透社普拉格廿八日電〕捷克國家安全警察隊及勞工自衛團，今在普拉格舊市府廣塲舉行大遊行，由共黨總理戈德華親自蒞塲檢閱。又捷克全國農民將於廿九日趕來捷京，參加農民大會，以設立「全國農民民主會」。貝奈斯總統偕夫人已於昨夜離捷京總統府，赴波希米亞南部之費齊諾夫渡週末。</p>
<p>貝奈斯戰時逃亡倫敦時之政治秘書後復任司法部長之達蒂那，在捷京郊外寓所被人發現頭部受有重傷。據警察發表達蒂那係自殺未遂，現已送醫院治療。同時「整肅運動」繼續積極展開，新聞記者大學講師·政治領袖·工廠職員不乏因「思想與國家陣綫不符」而被免職者。</p>

<p>〔路透社普拉格廿七日電〕據克新聞社今日發表捷克答　英美法三國聯合宣言之聲明，指三國無權干涉捷克之內政。並日此等國家常以民主應適用於國際關係爲標榜，而其最主要之原則，即爲不干涉他國之內政。聲明復日，此次政潮係因人民黨，捷克社會黨。斯洛伐克民主黨閣員之辭職而引起，而其解決辦法亦並不影響捷克之議會制度。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎二十七日電〕法外長皮杜爾在國民議會中報吿捷克事件，以之喩慕尼黑危機後明顯易見的危險信號。共黨議員聞言，高呼呌囂不已。當皮杜爾述及「法國業已愈加認識內部團結之必要，凡以國家利益爲重者，務必團結一致」等語時，全塲除共黨議員外，一律報以熱烈掌聲。</p>
<p>國民議會今日係舉行外交辯論，皮杜爾首先發言稱，「法國政府認爲捷克之最近發展，具有無從估計的重大意義，有悖和平原則，與廢除全歐專暴之諾言背道而馳。此次捷克之發展，乃有系統的多種類似發展之一，愈近法國，其危險性亦愈增。捷克無論在地理上政治上及道義上，具有特殊的敏感，歷史上的事實，久已充分顯示普拉格地位之重要。一不久以前，吾人尙記得捷克斯拉夫爲整個世界危險的信號」。至此共黨議員高呼呌囂。皮杜爾略事停頓，又高聲繼續說：一今彼希米亞的天空又再趨黑暗，愛好和平者的內心，又再度爲恐怖听籠罩。現在搬演的戲劇，顯然具有新的性質，國家的獨立今已成爲攻擊的目標，捷克之局勢，勢將變更國際狀態。此等手段不斷施行，終將引起極危險的發展。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕昨日此間成立一新政治集團，由左翼社會主義者及法國實體學派領袖薩爾特萊所觀成。該團體發表宣言，號召民主人士與無產階級團結一致，爭取共和國共同綱領之實。此黨自稱爲革命政黨，但亦反對史達林主綫及社會民主主義，宗旨係反對資本主義，但亦反對一以暴力抗暴力」主義。目標係國際主義，但又反對史達林及所謂「新法西斯主義」。準上所述，乃有若干報紙評述此黨爲「技術家與智職份子之幻夢」，決難置此黨於政治舞台。又有人謂此黨成立後將使社曾黨分裂，法國內共黨與戴高樂派之裂痕亦更將加深。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖廿八日電〕聯合國朝鮮臨時委員會主席，　印度代表梅農博士，今日於聯合國無綫電臺發表演說，京董保證計劃中在朝鮮南部舉行之選舉，將不致犧牲獨立昌　一，梅農向聽衆保證：所定之計劃爲在國民大會中保留　　北部合法選出代表之席位，渠希望此等代表將利用該項協議。渠稱：「即使彼等一時不能出席，但國民大會中之席位，仍將虛留以待。」</p>
<p>梅農表示希望選舉「最遲於五月份之第一星期內」即能開始。渠稱：聯合國大會已盡其所能促進及加速朝鮮之獨立，其餘任務有賴朝解各領袖本身之政治才能。渠稱：「政府之最後體制，必須由朝鮮人民自行決定，委員會與大會均將樂於協助朝鮮各領袖促進朝鮮統一獨立之企圖。」</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕參院撥款委員會今日發表國務卿馬歇爾在該委會中檢討美蘇關係之聲明。馬歇爾稱，在平時正常之對蘇關係中，蘇聯政府對吾人觀點之反應甚爲遲緩，與之協商殊非易事，且對吾人之企圖亦猜疑特甚。吾人遭遇種種困難，即因蘇聯猜忌之故。此種猜忌並非完全基於觀念之不同，吾人之所言所爲，幾無一不可猜疑。蘇聯之有此種猜忌，並非虛僞，但如能袪除猜忌，則兩國間之關係必可改善不少。然縱令袪除猜忌，吾人對於世界進化之意見，仍與蘇聯不能契合也。</p>

<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>「聯合國」的名稱從此誕生</p>
<p>在珍珠港事件之後，我幾乎立即開始考慮反抗希特勒和日本各國，究克應該採取什麼方式團結起來。到現在爲止，把和我們一起參加反抗軸心的拉丁美洲共和國包括在內，反抗軸心國家排算起來已近三十國之多了。</p>
<p>我對於盟國團結的第一個觀念，是以有關西半球事務的里瑪和哈伐耶會議爲根據的。這就是說，當危險發展開來的時候，聯合的抵抗必須組織起來。在我的思想中，我想把這種政策擴充到全世界去，因爲自從蒙吉維多會議以來，我時常在講我們的泛美政策是可以適用到全世界去的。</p>
<p>我要求我的同事從一九三八年起追溯我們對拉丁美洲的關係，檢討總統就反抗軸心各國間團結問題所說過的話，以及審查第一次世界大戰後所採取的各項步驟，包括統一指揮和軍事聯盟在內。</p>
<p>於是在一九四一年十二月十三日，星期六，我就要求遠東事務司司長漢密爾登（Maxwell　M．Hamilton）起草一個由反抗軸心各國發表的宣言，這將使它們團結一致，直到勝利，並且應該恪守我們所維護的基本原則。翌晨，星期日，也就是珍珠港事件之後剛剛一星期，我和我一輩同事會晤，討論這一個宣言以及另一個有關成立最高軍事會議的宣言。</p>
<p>漢密爾頓爲這個盟國宣言起草了兩份草稿，以待採用。這兩個草稿衹有一點不同，就是一個是把所有盟國都包括在內的，另一個是把宣言分開爲兩個，第一個是由所有盟國簽字，惟蘇聯不在其內，因爲它並不在對日作戰，第二個是蘇聯也簽字的。我們很快地決定把第二個草稿放棄，因爲我們相信把蘇聯包括在其他明國一起，要更有效力得多。在更進一步交換意見之後，我就請助理國務卿貝爾，經濟顧問范斯和漢密爾頓到另一個房間去，把建議中的修正包括入草稿之內，並且帶回到會議的地方來。他們就去照辦，而在半小時之內回來。</p>
<p>我們現在同意了後來變成聯合國宣言的要點。序文中首先重申羅斯福總統和邱吉爾首相在大西洋憲章中所同意的原則，繼即說明反抗軸心各國「深信它們在全世界的完全勝利，對於保衛和保存生命，自由和獨立以及保存人類自由和正義是必要的，不但是他們自己的國家中是如此，而在其他每一個地方都是一樣，它們現在從事的鬥爭，乃是反抗野蠻横暴勢力的共同保衛戰，因爲這種勢力正岡征服世界。」</p>
<p>其下是協定的要點，共計三點。每一個政府必須保證：第一，「運用其全部資源反抗會簽字於一九四〇年九月二十七日德日義三國協定的一個政府或幾個政府，對於這些政府它是正在作戰或者可能要作戰的，並且要繼續如此運出其力量，直到這個政府或者這些政府最後已被擊潰。」</p>
<p>第二，「與其他國家在各方面儘量合作，在軍事努力和資源的運用上充份協調，以反抗共同敵人或者他們中間的任何一個。」</p>
<p>第三，「對共同敵人或者他們中間的任何一個決不停止作戰或者簽訂單獨停戰協定，除非是經由共同協議的。」</p>
<p>這裏，覺得我們正從第一次世界大戰期間的立塲向前走上兩大有益的步驟。第一，我們設法使所有和軸心作戰的國家聯合一起，接受在大西洋憲章中業已聲明的若干原則。這些就是各國人民有選擇他們自己政府形式的權利；沒有擴張，沒有爲有關人民所反對的領土變更；貿易和獲致原料的便利；改善勞工標準，經濟進步和社會安全；國際安全；海上的自由；和解除軍備。</p>
<p>我國政府在參加第一次世界大戰的時候，並不曾努力使協約國受任何戰爭目標的約束。各種秘密協定早已由協約國政府所同意，根據這種協定，在戰爭獲勝之後可以作領土的變更。結果，　爾遜政府因爲未曾設法使協約國就戰爭目標獲致共同協定而受嚴厲批評。就爲了沒有這種協定存在之故，他在和會中所遭遇的問題因此大爲複雜。</p>
<p>這一次，我覺得明國應該事前約定若干原則，讓疆界調整的詳細辦法以及其他類似問題留待以後解決。假如這些原則能堅決加以闡明並予以恪守，那麽到解決細則的時候，就更容易獲得解決辦法的。</p>
<p>當然我們必須知道現在在明國之間是否又有什麼秘密協定存在。當我們向它們提出這個問題的時候，它們保證我們並沒有這類協定。</p>
<p>第二，這一次我們願意和反抗軸心的其他國家充份聯繫。在第一次世界大戰期間，我們自認爲和自稱爲「參與國家」，不是協約國。現在我們準備的宣言是屬於聯盟性質的，其中包括一般的軍事聯盟的兩個要點，就是保證在進行反抗共同敵人的戰爭中充份支持和合作，並且保證不停止反抗共同敵人的戰爭，除非是互相同意的。</p>
<p>從十二月十五日到十二月十九日我的同事和我費了相當時間去修節這個文件的草稿，這個文件後來就成爲聯合國宣言。我們並且討論另一個文件，以謀成立一個最高軍事會議，由聯合王國，美國，中國和蘇聯政府的首長或代表組成。</p>
<p>邱吉爾首相到華盛頓來了。在其後幾天中，總統和首相檢討建議中的聯合宣言的內容以及成立最高軍事會議的建議。邱吉爾首相或者哈里法克斯大使把它們通知倫敦，請戰時內閣表示意見。</p>
<p>十二月二十七日，總統送給我對於這兩個文稿的書面意見。邱吉爾已經接到戰時內閣對聯合宣言的建議，總統說他已把它們考慮在內了。</p>
<p>他說，「以爲應該作一切努力把宗敎自由包括在這個文件之內。我相信可以導使（蘇聯大使）李維諾夫同意此點的」。</p>
<p>他以爲保證繼續反抗軸心戰爭的字句，對於蘇聯人是難接受的。這是因爲他們並不在和日本作戰。他建議在字句方面稍爲改變一下，籍使這種保證適用於反抗正在實行征服的軸心武力，而和這種武力，簽字國是正在作戰的。</p>
<p>總統說他正在設想一種方法，使聯合宣言和最高軍事會議分爲兩個不同文件這一點，成爲無此需要。</p>
<p>他建議在聯合宣言開頭一節中所提出的各國名單，應該列舉和軸心作戰的全體國家，包括拉丁美洲共和國在內。他說，「在宣言中把小國儘量列入，在我看來顯然是有好處的」。</p>
<p>總統認爲中國和蘇聯應該從按照字母的排列法中提出來，和美國與英國置於名單之首。他表示意見說，「我有一種感覺，就是把蘇聯的名字放在若干在實際上貢獻較少的國家之後，蘇聯是不會高興的」。</p>
<p>他總結說；「我切盼對於宣言的文字應該予以最審懈的考慮，特別是有關我們作戰的眞正目的的這一部份，因爲它是要補充大西洋聲明的。</p>
<p>一，一俟你和哈里法克斯對聯合宣言意見接近之後，我以爲你，哈里法克斯，首相和我應該迅速舉行一次會議」。</p>
<p>其後，總統就在那天晚上六點鐘在白宮召集了一次會議，由這四個人參加。</p>
<p>在會議期間，總統和邱吉爾先生對於設立最高軍事會議的問題顯然還沒有獲致協議。大部份的討論都集中於這個題目。所以我們就同意採用聯合宣言的新草案，單獨成爲一個文件，將最高軍事會議的草案，劊待繼續討論。</p>
<p>在會讓之後，總統就請蘇聯大使李維諾夫進米，交結他一份稿本，請他立即轉呈政府表示意見。</p>
<p>兩天之後，李維諾夫到我的辦公室來，帶來了他政府所提的三項修疋。</p>
<p>總統同意把蘇聯的修正容納在內。於是我就送給他一個新草案，後者他于十二月三十日送回我，在邊沿上寫了幾句話：</p>
<p>「ＣＨ·ＯＫ·現在蘇聯和ＷＳＣ（邱吉爾）是核准了，中國還沒有核准。ＦＤＲ·讓它在一月一日出來。意思就是要迅速。ＦＤＲ。</p>
<p>我們，立即把聯合國宣言向名單中各國政府發出。按照總統的要求，我請有關各國政府立即表示響應，以便這個文件可以一月一日公佈。我請中國大使胡適博士進來，親自交給他一份稿本，以便轉呈政府。</p>
<p>翌日，十二月三十一日，我把聯合宣言的最後形式送呈總統，要他自己和首相簽字。我建議總統可以請李維諾夫大使和剛才被任爲中國外交部長的宋子文也到白宮來簽字其上。</p>
<p>十二月三十一日晨，當邱吉爾首相在白宮沐浴的時候，總統到他那裏去，建議聯合宣言應名之爲「聯合國宣言」。這位顯要的沐浴者表示同意，於是「聯合國」這個名稱從此誕生。總統把我們最後的草案在白宮重新抄了一篇，因此可用這個新名稱。</p>
<p>新年的第一天，羅斯福，邱吉爾，李維諾夫和宋子文簽署了這個歷史性的文件。</p>

<p>越獄日戰犯中野久勇押上法庭（中國社攝）</p>
<h3 id="c96">越獄潛逃日戰犯　中野久勇判死刑　對殺人暴行在軍庭仍圖狡賴 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕越獄潛逃兩月餘，終於被捕獲的日本戰犯前崇明憲兵隊特高科長中野久勇，已於昨日由本市軍事法庭審問後判處死刑。判決書主次是「中野久勇在作戰期間共同連續屠殺俘虜，處死刑。」</p>
<p>昨日上午八時，軍事法庭派副官郭薪夫·陳耀靑率領憲兵一班到警察總局拘留所將中野提解到江灣軍事法庭。中野要求大便進餐，軍事法庭派人替他買了大餅五枚充飢。十時三十分首先由戰犯監獄新任典獄長孫家軍副典獄長王成茶等審問，十一時一刻，軍事法庭審判長石美瑜，審判官葉在增·張體坤。檢察官王家楣，通譯官王仁明，書記官宋定亞等升庭，中野久勇穿黑灰長衫，着運動鞋，鬍髭滿面，供詞很爲狡猾。庭上首先問他越獄潛逃的動機及經過情形，中野供稱是他自己主動逃走，前任典獄長絕無帮忙之事。逃走原因是因本案與他「無關」，爲「避免無謂犧性，」所以才逃走。</p>
<p>越獄經過</p>
<p>越獄後把本來穿的一套西裝出賣，另到九江路以四十萬元買了現在穿的長衫。第一天晚上宿在北火車站附近，十六日定到嘉定，被城門口的警察檢査無身份證，且因帶有阿司匹靈粉兩包，被懷疑是白粉，遂被拘到當地警局，後又解送到本市警備司令部。在拘留所內，關了十八天，審過一次，問他帶的是否白粉，法官用中國話間，他也用中國話答。一月五日由警備部解到地方法院，又關了二十多天，兩包藥粉經化騐後並非白粉，遂於本月二日放出，即在乍浦路橋推三輪車。被捕前一天有一商人模樣的客人坐三輪車給他五千元要他找三千元，他因物價高漲不願意找，因此吵起來，第二天就被捕了。</p>
<p>一味狡辯</p>
<p>審判長就問他在崇明時將季學狗等九人用石塊綑縛擲到海中之事，並將軍法庭實地調査時在海邊拍到的枯骨照片給他看。中野竟說這些尸體可能是海中其他溺斃的死尸，被往來船隻的鐵錨冲激到海邊的。庭上又問他崇明當地居民常見他與大庭早志（已判死刑）兩人在晚上押帶中國人三五個或七八個到海邊去，一去不返，這些中國人到那裏去了？中野狡辯說：「當時常有大批警備隊出發討伐，但不能誤會，那是寃枉的」</p>
<p>庭上以本案前已幾次審訊，並已辯論終結，乃由檢察官起立宣吿：本案經被害人家屬黄上達等到庭作證，且經派員調査，攝有照片，證據十分確鑿，被吿雖尙否認，已罪無可這。至於逃亡之罪依刑事訴訟法二三三條不予起訴。至此審判長等退庭評議，約五分鐘後，重行登庭宣判，中野神情較爲緊張，聞判死刑後，口稱「謝謝公平判決。」語氣似帶議刺。</p>
<p>中野的上海口音中國話講得很不差，在營警察局看到軍事法庭派人去提解時，自知不免，曾說「希望早些死。」有記者問他究竟潛逃的目的如何？他說想到東北加入共產黨去。昨天宣判後軍事法庭將他押到提籃橋監獄收押。判決書將呈報國防部轉呈主席核准後即可執行。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶廿六日航訊〕重慶行轅副主任　毅肅自兼任重慶經備司令後，即有個宏大志願，轄區：江北，巴縣，合川，綦江，璧山，銅梁，永川，江津，榮昌，大足，南川，長壽，涪陵，武隆等十四縣的民衆糾訓，必須迅　完成。朱紹良主任在警備部召集的組訓曾議上，開首就說明：「如果在今年六月底以前，各縣民衆組訓有了把握，即使共匪竄擾川境，也不難使匪就地殲滅。」</p>
<p>共匪究竟有否竄川能力？朱紹良曾以</p>
<p>堅定口吻</p>
<p>在大會上宣稱：一鄂西北匪僅有兩個縱隊，而川陜，川鄂邊境增防的國軍，却較去年加倍。依據目前兵力展望，共匪幷無主力竄川，可是，匪絕對不會放棄竄援川境的企圖。」</p>
<p>然則，共匪可能由那條道路竄人川境？本報記者推測：（一）盤踞鄂北恥，鄭西的孔從周匪部第三十八縱隊，圖竄越陜境白河循洵陽，安康，紫陽擾川，據軍息：白河週圍羊尾寺，鮑家店，甲河關一帶已有孔匪踪跡。另匪一股三百餘人，亦竄抵鄖西，洵陽交界之關防舖，董家　，竹園河附近。（上列各地均在漢水以北）</p>
<p>孔匪動向</p>
<p>早有周密部署，擔任大巴山防初的方靖將軍，饒勇善戰，爲陳　總長早年統率之十八軍老幹部，刻前進指揮所設於達縣。</p>
<p>（二）羅　福匪部主力仍在馬良坪，一度曾西竄至歇馬河，因氣候寒冷，凍斃無數，目前不敢西進除了防止外匪侵入外，重慶行轅目前最重要的課題，即是消滅</p>
<p>川省潛匪</p>
<p>據本報記者已獲確訊：一月八日於川東巫溪，奉節，雲陽暴動的陳泰炎匪股，及最近竄擾大竹，隣水，墊江的陳堯階匪股，均經證實與匪勾結。陳泰炎匪公然標誌××支隊，而陳堯階匪的「政治指導員」則是塾江楊通鄉第二保保長徐永志，可見隱藏川境的共匪勢力已至不可輕視的地步，所以廿日召開，廿一日結束的重慶轄區各縣民衆組訓會議，意義至大。</p>
<p>蕭毅肅在大會中提出討論的「民衆自衛組訓實施方案」，是現階段</p>
<p>保甲人員</p>
<p>必讀的譯本。　再三聲明：如果轄縣實施有效，即呈請行轅轉令川令康·滇·黔四省辦理。大會第一日，他介紹了宛西民團的成功，及遼西·山東·山西民團組織情况。第二日，戰時曾在延安當過六年的國軍聯絡　謀，現任巴縣團管區司令陳宏模，則分析共匪的民衆組訓，最後才通過着毅肅</p>
<p>親自　訂</p>
<p>的方案。這本一萬八千餘字的方案，共分十章，計：（一）總綱。（二）組織。（甲。登記民槍及製備梆鑼信號。乙。成立鄉·區·鎭自衛會議，丙。編組不脫離生產之各種任務隊。丁·脫隊生產之常備隊班。）（三）裝備與旗幟臂章，（甲。武器彈藥。乙。各種工具。丙·被服。丁。旗幟臂章。）（四）訓練。（甲·各級警察隊及保警大隊。乙·不脫離生產之各種任務隊。）（五）平時行動。（六）戰時行動。（七）經費。（八）檢閱。（九）獎懲。（十）附則。每一個小節目，都有通俗的詳細說明。方案最主要精神，　爲鄉·區·鎭</p>
<p>自衛會議</p>
<p>，大會通過的全文是：一各縣（市）應以鄉·區。鎭爲單位，由縣（市）長徵詢各方意見，推鄉。區。鎭代表大會主席及該會推選之代表二至三人，當地領袖人士，優秀在鄉軍官組織鄉。區·鎭自衛會談。以鄉·區·鎭長爲主席，各保長必須參加，會議中最多不超過十一人，爲縣（市）以下辦理民衆自衛之最高權力機關。」</p>
<p>蕭毅肅素以言行一致聞名，在他的鐵腕下，轄區一定可以辦到：「內匪無法容身，外匪無從侵入。」（本報特派員歐陽醇）</p>

<p>昨日棉布市况，晨閒時各方人心仍虛，又爲月杪關係，銀根帶緊，同業套賣甚多，散戶吐售亦夥，喊價均吿下降。嗣至十點一刻許，北帮乘低吸納，染廠亦來進取，結果十二磅龍頭細布爲二百七十萬元，比上日軋升二萬元。又藍鷄及喇叭童細布，因有廠家搜吸，軋漲三四萬元。民營廠土布色布士林布等，以生活指數提高百分之五十，廠盤均予調整，市氣獨見挺秀。</p>
<p>棉花登記今日截止</p>
<p>本市棉花公會代紗管會收購國棉登記，原定昨日截止，惟尙有少數商行，未向該公會登記。該會決再延期至今日下午四時截止，星期照常辦公云。</p>

<p>人造絲昨市續吿挫降，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤即低至四千四百萬元，一度高至七百萬元，午收卒降爲六百萬元賣出價。下午人心更軟，行情續疲，最後挫爲三百萬元賣出價。　廠經昨市亦呈徵挫，‘午成交C字等級價做六千五百萬元，貨款只二三天期頭，高零損五百萬及四百萬元，均有幾担做開。昨逢週六，故交易甚寂。其餘各級，俱乏成交，喊價亦隨之而短。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市先降後堅，華强眞絲被面開市在七百萬元左右盤放，中間一度高叩七千萬元關口，收市終降爲八百五十萬元。大誠格子　縐開市在八萬五千元左右，收市爲九萬元，民生競芳呢，廠盤三十八萬元，本街納胄甚殷，其餘各貨，昨市均吿堅穩。</p>

<p>茶市自晨迄收，終在原途盤旋。良以各項花色，賣戶雖　擬高扳，但在連日在升後，漸達飽和點，且乏刺激消息，故過程頗有再好無力之象。至於交易方面，外銷茶因出口商尙嫌價昻，無意活動。內銷茶則以本街與蘇錫一帶之走銷仍佳，故買氣尙未消戢，成交數量不弱。</p>

<p>昨日燃料類之烟白煤，因來源不繼，而市銷異常活潑，存底見减，行情迭漲不已。做開焦作塊煤每噸昂至一千二百萬元，奉節白煤一千萬元，萍薌烟煤亦漲至九百五十萬元，大同烟煤一千〇六十萬元，辰谿烟屑八百三十萬元，徐州洗焦炭每噸又升五十萬，售八百五十萬元，較之上日步騰一成至成半之譜。</p>

<p>— 許人</p>
<p>墊居鬧市十有餘年，最近有機會到故鄉去了一次。上海一地，筆者素來不大喜歡，厭其太擁攘，太煩誰，厭其謠言特別多．一旦發生什堅事故，總是誇大了好幾倍互相傳播着。有的論貿明明全然無稽，只以為了大家信其必有，時殊階級便推波助瀾，有時也竟會使謠言成為事實。上海的環境對於此等特殊階級很是適宜，對於安份守己之輩，似乎是不大合適的。我的不喜歡上海，其故在此。然而　管不喜歡，而竟居留了十餘年，眞是出　　料之外的。所以－有返鄉的機會，便欣然而往了。</p>
<p>多年沒有乘火車，只是聽得人們傳說火車是如何如何的擠，如何如何的不便。所以事前會托擬設法預先購赴　州的車。可是到了車站，連去買票，覺很並不如想像的那麽不便；待上了車，覺得旅客也並不如想像的那麼　擠。這或許是火車的班次關係，或許是季節關係吧。</p>
<p>好儂她從去年起，鐵路當局增設了對號入座的列車，雖說車資較一般的列車為貴，可是倒底座位比較的舒適，行駛也比較的迅速。這個辦法，在戰前好像是沒有的，這是－種進步。只是有一點我頗為不解；何以其他的列車不也採取對號入座的辦法呢？當然，我也知道「對號車」是為了與別的列車有所區別，正如－般的列車分頭二三等－樣。可是等級儘可分為頭二三等，正如列車可以分做特快，普通，慢車一樣，然此倆無妨於車票的對號入座。購票的派客一律予以座位，這在我國交通工具成問題的時候，自然是難以做到的。我的辦法是：凡列車座位，不論與為「遊覽車」，或頭二三等車，只要尚有餘座，未會「客滿」，鐵路當局一律予旅客以對號車票，待座位巳無虛額，始售普通不對號的車票。這樣必可免去無謂的爭先恐後之弊，是其一；其次，這個辨法可以防止旅客的越級乘車。爭先登車的最大原因，是為了搶座位；待實行了對號的辦法，則有座無座，各人事前早已知道；沒有買到對號票的，自知總歸沒法佔得座位，便無所用其搶先；自知有座位的，自更不必爭前了。火車上還有一們弊病是：依照車站售票處的估計，明明頭等或二等車廂裏是有空位的，只為了二等或三等車的旅各過擠，見頭等或二等有空座，三等車的誠客便擁到二等或頭等去，二等車的旅客見無空座自然也擁到頭等去。如此，購了頭二等票的旅客反而沒有座位了。說得嚴格些，此即是不守法，只是此種情形，總為了「僧多粥少」之故，自然話也就然須說得如此嚴重。不過購了頭二等票，本來可以佔有座位，為了別的旅客越級之故，致無餘座，其不大合理，却也是眞的。採取對號辦法，便可免去此弊。票價方面，對號的與不對號的，自然也不妨予以差別。記得上海早年戲院，亦不採用對號辦法；及稍後，價較高的座位始行對號入座；到了如今，則是戲院一律對號入座了。小小的一件關於戲票的事，也頗可看出循步演進之跡。火車座位一律對號的辨法將來一定會採用，此可預言，不過似也並無不可立即實行之理由，不知鐵路常局願予考慮否？</p>
<p>却說車開後一路里野景色，看了胸懷不禁為之一暢，這且一筆表過不題。且說到了杭州城站下車，改乘杭市公用局客車，過錢江大橋。杭市公用局客軍以對江為終站，若赴紹興，須換乘蕭山到會娥的長途汽車。這麼短短的一段路程——自城站到六江，車行約四十五分鐘——旅客上車下車，自感不便。蕭會段的長途汽車，戰前早巳開駛，其以江邊為終點的原因，常時是因為錢江大橋尚未完成的緣故。今日錢江大橋旣已通車，為何不改以杭州城站為終點呢？考其原因，諒是蕭曹段的汽車與杭州公用局的汽車各有其　　機　　緣故。實則讓蕭曹段汽車以城站為終點，也不致予杭市公用局汽車以多大不利影響，因為只有赴寗紹的旅客才會去擠蕭曹段的長途汽車，目的地只在江邊的人們自然仍是去搭乘杭市公用　車子的。竊思為旅客便利計，這種分段的缺點似也有改革的的必要。這點雖是行旅方面的一件小事，可是筆者深信社會的改進是累進的，是積點點滴滴的而促成的；改進這個分段的小缺點即是大改進中的一點一滴。目前我國的交通，為了戰禍，斷斷續續的也分裂得足夠了，只是那還可以說是不得已，然而我們又何必對於殊可不必要的場合也予以分裂呢？</p>
<p>駛江邊的杭市公用局汽車好像駛過西湖邊的茅家埠，是不是不能克定；並可望見湖中長長的一條堤，不知是蘇堤還是白堤？又望見湖邊一個莊子，不知是否汪莊？函湖景色，筆者素以為茅家埠一角最為實樸可喜，可惜時間匆促，只是　鴻一暼耳。杭市這段公路好像另有支路通五雲山，因為車上曾暼見一個路亭，這個路亭余在十五年前赴五雲途中候車　曾躱過雨的，而今居然未毀。車過西湖一角後約五分鐘，　到達錢江大橋了。</p>
<h3 id="c142">懸 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>有一位寄居在人家做家庭敎師的親戚，這天跑來，送了兩瓶法國香水，兩盒美國製的補藥給我，使我摸不淸頭腦。這親戚到上海來原是想投考大學的，只因證件尚未濟備，不得其門而考，於是退而求其次，當一名備　秋季再　上進。當然　家庭敎師的束修，維持一已的生活，中夠淸苦，要不是食宿均在學生家中，享受「有酒食，先生饌」的特權，說不定選要貼錢。然則這份送來的禮物，對於我不禁大惑不解，就是說年節餽遺吧，也無需這樣隆重的禮物。像送來的這種法國香水，我知道市價當在二百萬元以上一瓶，而兩瓶補藥的代價，也非百萬金不辦。難道我這位窮親戚，敎書之餘，兼做進出口生意，因之利潤浩大，把這種貴重的東西隨便人不成？我的懷疑，也許對於這小一輩的新戚過份關切，終於用下列問句打開了胸中的疑團：</p>
<p>我：你近來除了敎書以外，還做一點副業的吧？</p>
<p>戚：不，除了敎書以外的時間，我只是看一些書，預備入學考試。</p>
<p>我：（望一望桌上的禮物）那你未免太浪費了，買了這樣貴重的——</p>
<p>戚：（不等我說完就接下來）我這些東西是現成的。</p>
<p>我：現成的？唉，你還是放着當囤貨吧，要積下錢來買一點東西，也不容易。</p>
<p>戚：我沒有多餘的錢來囤貨。</p>
<p>我：那末你何苦要這樣浪費地去買香水，補品？</p>
<p>戚：在老叔面前我不用隱瞞，這些都是敎書人家送給，自己沒有用，就轉送給老叔。</p>
<p>我：那末這敎書人家倒是挺慷慨的。</p>
<p>戚：說慷慨眞不錯。他家平時買進的零零碎碎的東西，包括日用品，藥品，罐頭食物等，多得不可勝數。前天為了整理起見，費了兩個大半天還沒有整理好。有些東西，如香烟和罐頭食物之類，已經發霉，生銹，不能食用，就委諸垃圾。一部份魚肝油已經變質，也這樣隨便丟掉。主人家因此覺得為趕快出淸陳年宿貨起見，非大景贈送不可，以免暴殄天物。不但全家傭僕都得賞贈，居然惠及區區業師。像這類香水，貯存者堆滿了兩層櫥窗，各式各樣都有。至於外國補品，西藥，更是滿箱滿箧，事實上他家孩子生病，從來不取成藥，總是到藥房裏去配方的。</p>
<p>我：（沒有作答，使我的想像牽到了一個幻奇的境蜀……）</p>
<p>戚：主人說，這許多東西使他煩惱，出淸了才感痛快，否則以後不能再買東西回家。</p>
<p>對話於此告一段落。我覺得主人所說的煩惱，頗可玩味，旣然因「有餘」而煩惱，還是貧而樂的好。當每次寒流來襲的時候，總是十幾個或數十個「路有凍死骨」，無怪朱門要感酒肉臭。血這種臭味，便是朱門所最感討厭與煩惱的一件事。今日的世界，便是這樣懸殊的一幅圖畫。</p>
<h3 id="c143">還有四萬元呢？ <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 金有豫</p>
<p>有七個朋友一回到酒店裏去喝酒，臨走時接到一張七十萬元的帳單，於是每個人把十萬元交給侍者。當坐者將款子交到賬台上去的螩，賬房先生忽然發現自己的錯誤，只要六十萬就夠了，於是他退了十萬元給侍者。侍者想十萬元七個人分，沒有小票子是難以分配的，反正他們也不知道正確的賬款，找給他們每人一萬元得了，還剩三萬元就算是自己的外快。於是就找給他們每人一萬元，所以實際他們每人只出九萬元。試算一下：七乘九萬是六十三萬元，連侍者袋中藏了三萬元，共計六十六萬元，而他們七個人共付了七十萬元，那麼還有四萬元那裏去了？</p>
<h3 id="c144">人心如鏡 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 許津津</p>
<p>美國紐約各雜誌闢有專欄，專事　集五花八門的「小新聞」，酌加按語，其意義明顯者，則不再加註，如某期載有一條云：</p>
<p>底德律性犯罪已見抑止—見底德律新聞報標題</p>
<p>底德律性犯罪「浪」迄未戰止—見同日底德律自由報標題</p>
<p>粗粗一看，頗　令人發生一種矛盾的感覺，仔細一想，也許由於記者的立場與看法不同所致。我常覺人心似一面鏡子，有係凸光鏡者，有以四光鏡者，光度各各不同，其所反映的事物，自亦逈異。筆者嘗在某次宴會中聽到張趙二君為了一張影片而作沒有目的爭執。</p>
<p>張：「這張片子，男主角年齡已嫌太高，不配演風流小生的角色，而且情節簞單，一點沒有意思。」</p>
<p>趙：「不然，片子中歌舞場而偉大，色彩絢爛，單是菩蒂赫登跳幾支舞，喝幾支歌，就值得一看。」</p>
<p>其實張說張有理，趙說趙有理，張愛看情節片，趙愛看歌舞片，片子本身也許有好歹，但大半却因為觀者所　的標準不同故耳。</p>
<p>在一個特殊的例子中，有人因為　到路上有救火車駛過而掩掩不住心中的喜悅，蓋北公專以代保險公司拍賣盡餘的衣裝為業，從中有一筆佣金到手也。</p>
<p>再者，同一件事物，在各色人等的心中，映出的景象，大相逕庭。茹素戒殺的人不時買牛羊等放生，印度人則將牛奉為神明，儘有牛隻在街上大搖大擺的走，行人反避在路側的奇事。而在　　家這來，他首先想到的也許是炸牛排，或者是一碗烹調入味的五香牛肉吧。</p>
<p>又如大家對顏色的看法，亦頗有趣。年輕女人，愛穿紅色，年齡較長者，則多穿深顏色。已故英國作家G．K．吉斯特頓在「談襯衫」一文中，對於淡藍色，並無間言，說它望天空一色。而對於紅色則大為不滿，稱它為「玫瑰的褪色與火的減色」，又說淡紅色的社會主義者做不成大事，言外之意，似在抨擊騎牆派與投機份子。而吉氏聯想力的豐富，似於此可見一二。</p>

<p>第十一章　滿腹疑雲　（八三）</p>
<p>在鳳笙方面，她認為和她沒緣分，在雲卿方面，他還認為我和原笙離婚是為她而起，現在她也許正在作好夢呢，至小王媽所疑我和雲卿在一起，給綺執看見，生了反感，未嘗不是一個理由，可是我最近並沒和雲卿在一起。至於家庭中，更沒人知道我有這些事。渚齋前後想了一想，覺小王媽所說的話，沒什麼注意價值。但是綺執何以會和繆處長接近，為什麼對自己變態，這一惆悶葫蘆，眞教人難受。渚齋用種種揣測，總務不出道理來。最後決定，見綺執時，別的事都不必提，祗勸她不要接近這般武人，祇要她能覺悟，或是她能說出所以結交姓繆的理由，一切問題就都可解決。渚齋抱定這觀念，鄰晚回到宿舍之後，運打數次電話詢問，綺執都還沒有唱碟，第二日再打電話查問，綺執仍沒回來，這次渚齋心理，便不似上次那樣恐慌，只是增加妬念，知道綺執在外停眠整宿，總是為挪姓繆的所牽絆。如此一來，將來枓紛事情很多，以她個性倔強，是管束不了的，處己又沒有相當財力，將來一切一切，反要仰她的鼻息，果然如此，豈不遠背當日和她結識的本意！經了這三天工夫，渚齋對綺執，而是愛護，惟恐她出了什麼意外，繼而是憐憫，實在難得人諒解。所以自第二日打過電話詢問之後，便不　先前那樣熱烈關切她。在第三日，第四日，第早打過一次電話，一聽綺紈還沒回來，不再通電話。一直到五日，渚齋見報上載有新聞，略謂「新來某要員，到平後迷戀某名優，名譽狼藉，近為某外國記者，以畫面向當局揭發，聞當局大為震怒，決澈查嚴辦，聞有關機關已奉到此項電令，某處長着先記大過一次，並將其經辦事宜，澈查具報……」渚齋看了這條新聞，覺得「某名優」三字，很是刺目。</p>

Vice President Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting. In addition to the general budget, the meeting also discussed and processed the "Regulations on Punishing Smuggling," which was passed with revisions as reviewed. The "Regulations on the Protection of Survey Markers of the Ministry of National Defense" were passed with revisions as reviewed.

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The National General Budget for the first half of the 37th year, passed by the Legislative Yuan today, is divided into ordinary and special sections, totaling over 962.7 trillion national currency.</p>
<p>The ordinary expenditure section amounts to over 266 trillion yuan, with the following percentages: (1) National defense expenditure, approximately 39%; (2) Ordinary administrative expenditure, approximately 27%; (3) Education, science, and culture expenditure, approximately 13%; (4) Economic and transportation expenditure, approximately 2%; (5) Bond expenditure, approximately 14%; (6) Other, approximately 2% (decimal points for the above figures are not included).</p>
<p>The special expenditure section amounts to over 696.6 trillion yuan, of which: (1) Adjustment of living allowance and non-staple food subsidy reserve accounts for 45%; (2) National defense expenditure accounts for 31%; (3) Transportation expenditure accounts for 5% (decimal points for the above figures are not included).</p>
<p>Decision to Re-examine the Establishment of Special Criminal Courts</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] During the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th, when discussing the "Amendment to Article 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitorous Activities During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion and the Draft Regulations on the Organization of Special Criminal Courts," committee members spoke one after another, firmly opposing the independent establishment of special criminal courts, which would damage the complete judicial system at the beginning of constitutional governance by creating such a special institution. The case was first reported by Liu Kebei, Chairman of the Legal Committee, regarding the review process and the main points of the revision of the draft regulations on the organization of special criminal courts. He stated that the initial review opinion intended to attach special criminal courts to the high courts in necessary areas, but considering military judicial institutions, it was decided to maintain the principle of independent establishment. Subsequently, Lin Bin spoke, advocating for simultaneous review with the trial procedure law and urging attention to the fact that judicial power should be entirely under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the constitution. Sun Jiulu believed that the Legislative Yuan had made great efforts to abolish special criminal regulations during the War of Resistance, and this deformed system should not be revived. Since cases of treason are under the jurisdiction of ordinary courts, crimes of internal disorder are not more serious than crimes of foreign invasion, so why the need for special treatment? He also pointed out that suppressing rebellion is to quell chaos, and harsh penalties that disturb the people will only lead to more chaos. He advocated for the establishment of temporary special criminal courts attached to the high courts in necessary areas to handle bandit cases. Sheng Zhenwei cited British Prime Minister Attlee's view on China's implementation of new criminal law, saying, "The legal texts of many countries are beautifully written, but the most important thing is full implementation." He believed that the Special Criminal Court, jointly established by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, is neither fish nor fowl, destroying judicial unity. He advocated for passing the initial review opinion, and at least the personnel should be solely appointed by the judicial side. Liu Butong explained that the special criminal system originated in fascist Italy, violating the democratic trend, and advocated that the case be returned for review. Chen Ruxuan also opposed such regressive measures at the beginning of constitutional governance, especially the original draft's provision that the Ministry of Judicial Administration is the highest adjudicating body. Chen Haicheng also stated that the principle should be attachment to local high courts, and independent establishment should be possible when necessary, but it must be purely subordinate to the judicial system. At this point, Liu Keqiao further explained that according to the "Regulations on Punishing Acts Endangering the State During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion," the establishment of a Special Criminal Court should not be a problem, but its organization and trial procedures should be carefully studied by relevant agencies. He also agreed to return the case for review. Chairman Wu Tiecheng also believed that this matter is related to the overall health of the constitutional judiciary and should be carefully considered. Finally, the entire body unanimously passed that the case be returned for review, determined to maintain judicial independence and integrity.</p>

The rationale for the case stated that the defense of the Northeast is extremely important for world peace and the success of suppressing the rebellion, and it should be supported as much as possible. Furthermore, the current situation in the Northeast is extremely precarious and fleeting. The entire nation must raise its awareness, concentrate manpower and resources to gain time, boost morale, and reverse the military decline. The measures include: (1) Rapidly dispatching heavy troops for reinforcement; (2) Establishing local armed forces using effective methods; (3) Seriously promoting defection work; (4) Actively promoting the general mobilization to suppress the rebellion; (5) Expanding food airlift; (6) Rapidly restoring the traffic on the Yupan Railway; (7) Organizing and training refugees to prepare for returning home.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Government Information Office issued the following statement on the 28th regarding grain rationing in the five major cities: The implementation of the rationing plan is based on Article II(f) of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, which states, "In major Chinese cities where circumstances permit, a system of distribution and price control should be established to ensure that people of all strata, regardless of their purchasing power, obtain a fair share of relief supplies imported from abroad or produced locally." China's constructive food control is being implemented for the first time, and the government will strive to make this system a permanent way to conserve food sources.

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Traitor Zhou Fohai died of illness at 2 PM on the 28th at the Capital Prison on Tiger Bridge in Nanjing. After being sentenced to death by the Capital High Court on November 7th, 36th year, Zhou tried in many ways to seek amnesty and had his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Zhou then lived comfortably in cell No. 4, enjoying himself, and even planned to lead a group of traitors to organize a Peking opera troupe. Last September, his old heart disease recurred, soon turning into angina. On February 9th of this year, he contracted dry gangrene, which then spread to his liver and stomach, almost stopping his heartbeat. However, after Dr. Qi Shounan's best efforts, he survived until today. In the past six months, Zhou repeatedly sought bail for medical treatment, but the Ministry of Judicial Administration did not approve it. From the 28th, his condition suddenly worsened, and he sweated profusely all morning. By noon, he was unconscious. After treatment by the prison doctor was ineffective, he died just as external doctors and family members arrived at 3 PM. Zhou was from Xiangtan, Hunan, and was 51 years old. His son, Zhou Youhai, and daughter, Zhou Xihai, are both in Shanghai and are expected to arrive on the 29th. Zhou was dressed in a white cotton undershirt, and a pair of glasses were placed on the spring bed. His bones were as thin as firewood, and the arrogant face of the infamous traitor was no more.</p>

<h3 id="e22">National General Budget for the First Half of the Year: Legislative Yuan Review Opinion Report <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing 28th Dispatch] The National General Budget案 for the first half of the 37th year, amounting to over 96 trillion yuan, has been approved in the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th. The full text of the review opinion report of the Yuan is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"The administrative authorities have always submitted the budget to the Yuan for review around or after the start of the fiscal year.  Without sufficient time for detailed review, and without providing a final account within the statutory period for reference in reviewing the next year's budget, the Yuan has always felt that its budget review has been merely a formality, failing to fulfill its duty. This is something that all members of the Yuan should deeply reflect upon. The budget for the first half of the 37th year was also submitted to the Yuan for review nearly one month after the start of the fiscal year. Its content is based on the estimated numbers derived from the previous year's principal budget and supplementary budget of various agencies, which is clearly inconsistent with actual needs.  Just considering the revenue and expenditure figures listed in this budget, the expenditure listed in the budget for the first half of this year is enormous, and the deficit is significant. Considering the recent trend of rising prices and the results of budget implementation in recent years, the deficit in the future budget will be many times greater than what is listed today. If we rely solely on issuing currency or borrowing foreign debt to maintain it, the perilous future is simply unimaginable. After the Great War, our country continued with military operations to suppress bandits. The people are deeply impoverished, and financial resources are drying up. The administrative authorities have indeed made painstaking efforts to raise funds for national use, but being constrained by the environment and following old habits without fundamental reforms is an undeniable fact. The members of this Yuan deeply understand the current difficulties of the country. In addition to the opinions already put forward by the Resident Committee of the National Political Council, we now list the following examples of reforms and points of attention in various aspects of revenue and expenditure:</p>
<p>A: Regarding the revenue side:</p>
<p>(1) The surplus revenue listed by various national banks under the management of the Ministry of Finance and the China National Goods Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, and Sze Ming Bank with government and private shares should all be appropriately increased after further consideration.</p>
<p>(2) For the revenue under the management of various customs authorities, some of the listed amounts are too small, and some are even several times less than the actual amount in the previous year. For example, in the general budget revenue and expenditure, the regular revenue section, item 11, "Income from Academic Interests of National Property," under the management of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Station, the promotion and breeding stations in the Hubei, Henan, Anhui area and East China area, the Tao River Basin and Qinling National Forest Area Administration, and the First Economic Forestry Farm, only list an income of 10,000 yuan for this year. The promotion and breeding stations in the West China area, North China area, Northwest China area, South China area, and Southwest China area only list 20,000 yuan each. The Tobacco Production Improvement Office only lists 30,000 yuan. Furthermore, the income of the promotion and breeding station in the Central China area under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was 6 million yuan last year, but only 10,000 yuan is listed in this budget. The income of the Northwest Animal Disease Prevention Office was 100,000 yuan last year, but only 20,000 yuan is listed in this budget. The income of the Peiping Agricultural Experiment Station was 30 million yuan last year, but only 50,000 yuan is listed in this budget. Considering that prices have risen several times in the past year, the listed income is actually less than the income in the previous year. Also, the China Grain Industry Company, under the management of the Ministry of Food, only lists an income of 150,000 yuan. Given the large scale of this company, why is the income from property interests so low? All of these should be reviewed separately and appropriately increased after verification.</p>
<p>(3) Various tax revenues under the management of the Ministry of Finance, especially customs duties, commodity taxes, and direct taxes, should be thoroughly rectified, with every penny going to the public treasury to enrich the national coffers.</p>
<p>(4) To address the huge budget deficit, the government should promptly conduct property registration and take practical measures to ensure that those who have money contribute, in accordance with the principle of taxation based on ability to pay.</p>
<p>(5) The various processing agencies for surplus U.S. military materials and Lend-Lease materials, seized enemy and puppet property and materials, and Japanese reparations materials should be unified and merged to reduce waste and eliminate corruption, thereby increasing revenue. All sales prices should be appropriately increased after verification, and the responsible authorities should be strictly ordered to publicly announce the processing status on a regular basis.</p>
<p>B: Regarding the expenditure side:</p>
<p>(1) Agencies established without legislative procedures and redundant agencies should be reviewed and abolished by the Executive Yuan to save money.</p>
<p>(2) The tax authorities under the Ministry of Finance have complex structures. The (methods) for adjusting and simplifying them should be drafted according to the Yuan's previous year's procedures and submitted to the Yuan for review.</p>
<p>(3) The organization of the Ministry of National Defense is large and complex. It should be adjusted and simplified further according to the Yuan's recommendations from the previous year.</p>
<p>(4) According to the Constitution, education funding should not be less than 15 percent. The education funding listed in this budget is actually less than the amount in the previous year, so attention should be paid to finding ways to increase it. Furthermore, in the Ministry of Education's budgeted temporary expenses, item 10, training expenses, lists 140.8491 billion yuan for half a year, which is far greater than the 19.63706 billion yuan listed for the entire previous year. Attention should be paid to adjusting this.</p>
<p>C: Regarding other matters:</p>
<p>(1) According to the report of the administrative authorities, the increase in prices is far greater than the amount of currency issued. The issuance system should be made public and announced regularly to alleviate the public's psychological fears and help stabilize the currency value.</p>
<p>(2) The Executive Yuan should hire experts to thoroughly investigate the assets and actual business operations of various state-owned enterprises, calculate their profits and losses, and expose any concealment in order to rectify them and enrich the national treasury."</p>
<p>During the discussion, Chen Haicheng emphasized that the government should levy property taxes with the greatest determination. Chen Ruxuan pointed out that, as a result of inflation, this large budget is only two-thirds of the budget for the 25th year and is almost entirely used to support public officials. There is no economic policy, the performance of public industries is pitiful, and private manufacturers are too restricted, which is a completely suicidal policy. If this continues, it will be extremely difficult to complete the important tasks of the transitional government to suppress the rebellion and implement constitutional governance. Zhong Tianxin pointed out that foreign news reports that U.S. aid in various forms since the victory totaled $2.8 billion. Whether this is accurate and how it is used should be reviewed as a lesson for the future use of U.S. aid. Wei Tingsheng further lamented that due to policy errors since the victory, foreign exchange has been wasted and lost in various ways. He believes that self-reliance should start with the government re-establishing its credibility, and relying solely on foreign aid and loans is absolutely impossible to make up for the deficit. These opinions were also decided to be compiled and included in the opinion letter to request the attention of the administrative authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Assisting Our Country in Establishing an Air Force: More Than 1,000 U.S. Aircraft Sold to China: Washington Officials Reveal Secret Agreement <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 27th Dispatch] U.S. government officials revealed a very lengthy secret agreement on the 27th. According to the agreement, the United States is supplying China with 1,071 aircraft, including heavy bombers and fighter planes. They revealed that 936 aircraft have already been delivered to the Chinese National Government, and the remaining 135 aircraft have been designated to be delivered to China at a later date, including 37 B-17s, 42 P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, 53 P-51 Mustang fighters, and 3 C-47 transport aircraft. In addition, there is also air force equipment worth $178 million to be shipped to China, including spare parts. The cost of this batch of aircraft prepared for delivery to China is approximately $131 million, but the value sold to China is only $7.2 million. This secret plan will enable the Chinese government air force to have a heavy bomber squadron, a medium bomber squadron, four single-engine fighter squadrons, two airborne troop squadrons, and an aerial photography reconnaissance squadron. This agreement was proposed before the end of the Great War and was considered extremely secret by both countries. It was not to be announced until the United States guaranteed to assist China in maintaining and establishing an air force. According to the agreement, the Chinese air force is approximately equal to the strength of European countries such as Spain, Yugoslavia, or Turkey. The types of aircraft to be delivered to China are those used by the U.S. Air Force in World War II, but due to the development of super-bombers and jet aircraft, these types of aircraft are somewhat outdated. U.S. State Department officials revealed this secret plan in response to the demand of Republican lawmakers to strengthen military aid to China. Republican lawmakers in both houses of Congress criticized the State Department's proposed $570 million aid plan for China last week for including only economic aid. Secretary of State Marshall, while urging Congress to take swift action on the economic plan, carefully avoided committing the United States to fully support China's military, political, or economic aspects. He told a congressional committee on the 26th that U.S. military aid to China is already far greater than generally known. This statement clearly alludes to the secret air force agreement. According to this agreement, in addition to supplying aircraft, the United States is also responsible for training Chinese pilots and technicians in the United States and China. The plan includes training 1,546 flight pilots, 360 bombers, 192 navigators, and 3,034 technical personnel. The agreement expired on December 31 of last year, costing a total of $8.75 million. The delay in delivering aircraft to China after the expiration of the plan is partly due to the government's ban on arms shipments to China from the summer of 1946 to last summer.</p>
<p>It is also learned that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and military officials do not attach great importance to the quantity of the Chinese air force. They all believe that what is most needed is the reorganization of the Chinese army. They point out that military transport aircraft are more important to China than other types of aircraft. Because the Communist army's night maneuvers cannot become the target of its strafing and bombing activities. This can only be effective in field battles.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Kennan's Trip to the East and Japan Policy Eight <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 26th: The U.S. government is currently re-evaluating its Far East policy, and Secretary of State Marshall has dispatched strategist George Kennan, chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, to Japan to investigate the country's actual situation. How will Kennan's itinerary unfold? What mission does he bear? Secretary Marshall has not revealed this, but the significance of Kennan's trip is self-evident. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 26th: A senior U.S. official commented on Kennan's trip to Tokyo, saying: Secretary of State Marshall's efforts to promote the "restoration of Japan" are due to his conclusion that the Chinese National Government can never be in a decisive position to resist communism in Asia; therefore, Kennan's trip to Japan is a prelude to the United States' intention to drastically change its Japan policy and build Japan into a fortress to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding its influence in the Far East. Although these are speculations from UPI diplomatic correspondents and may not be entirely credible, especially the UPI's claim that "the United States has decided to abandon its position of severely punishing Japan, which it held at the Potsdam Conference, and is trying to restore Japan's economic prosperity so that it can become a fortress to resist communism in Asia," is even more unbelievable. However, Kennan has already departed for Japan and will meet with MacArthur. It is beyond doubt that a major change in U.S. policy toward Japan will occur. Therefore, although we do not completely believe these messages, they cannot but cause us distant concerns.</p>
<p>Nearly two and a half years have passed since Japan's surrender. It cannot be said that MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan has achieved considerable success. However, the Allied Headquarters' treatment of Japan, whether in disarming Japan, lowering Japan's industrial level, or fundamentally eliminating its aggressive ideology, is inevitably too lenient and too tolerant. Especially MacArthur himself, not only does not doubt anything about Japan, but also absolutely believes in it. The editorials of this newspaper in the past year have repeatedly reminded MacArthur not to trust Japan too much; and repeatedly advised the U.S. government and public to be more vigilant toward Japan, as tolerance breeds evil. Under the circumstances a month ago, this aggressive train of Japan would soon start again. However, for two and a half years, the United Kingdom has been moving in this direction and has never changed. Naturally, it cannot but give the impression that the United States is supporting Japan's revival and anti-communism there. Therefore, Professor Hu Sheng, a political commentator with the most stable ideas, also had to say this: "In the minds of some people in Western democratic societies, the fundamental issue regarding the peace treaties with Germany and Japan today is no longer how to prevent the revival of Germany and Japan, but how to support and utilize these two wartime strong enemies to resist another victorious ally. Although this ideological and policy reversal has not yet been expressed in concrete plans or public documents, this trend can already be seen from all sides." Zhou's view was later refuted by Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, who bluntly pointed out: "I observe the responsible statements and actions of Western democratic countries and can make three judgments: (1) Western democratic countries have not abandoned the fundamental policy of preventing the revival of the aggressive forces of Germany and Japan; (2) because the two countries are fundamentally not allowed to rearm, Western countries will never support the two countries to resist the Soviet Union; (3) the so-called prevention of the revival of Germany and Japan should be interpreted as doing everything possible to prevent the revival of the armed and aggressive forces of these two countries." However, in the minds of the general public, the notion that the United States is supporting Japan to oppose the Soviet Union still remains. When Cabot, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai, he made a speech to correct the general public's misunderstanding of the United States, and solemnly declared that the United States had no intention of supporting Japan to become an anti-communist fortress in Asia. We naturally deeply believe in the reasons listed by Cabot, but now that we see the news of Kennan's trip to Tokyo and the speculation that the United States will change its Japan policy, the anxiety and fear in our hearts rise again, making us have to say something to the U.S. government:</p>
<p>China's protest against Japan was the prelude to World War II, and China was the vanguard of the anti-aggression war. By the time the global war broke out, that is, after the war in the two continents of Europe and Asia merged, China signed the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference Declaration and became one of the four major powers in the world. At that time, all political and diplomatic teams with a global vision believed that after the downfall of the violent Japanese in the Far East, a stable force would be needed, and it would be the victorious China. Later, after the victory, the U.S. government and public also unanimously hoped that China would become a strong, unified, peaceful, and democratic country, and be the only stable force in the Far East. However, for two and a half years after the victory, because of the Chinese Communists' playing with weapons, not only was the country unable to achieve peace and unification, but also the national strength became increasingly weakened, which greatly disappointed friendly countries. Therefore, they changed their original attitude and wanted to support Japan. This view is not only extremely wrong, but also carries great danger. The current situation in China can be said to be a temporary phenomenon encouraged by the Chinese Communists' playing with weapons. Now the Chinese government and public are united in fighting the rebellion and suppressing the bandits. It should not be difficult to quell the war in the shortest possible time, establish a new, peaceful, and democratic China, and assume the special responsibility for peace in the Far East. Therefore, the United States' support for Japan not only ignores China's importance in the Far East, but also their vision is inevitably too short-sighted.</p>
<p>Even if people take a step back and assume that China is beyond redemption, the United States' policy of supporting Japan will not succeed. We don't have to state the reasons, but even Secretary Marshall himself knows this very well. When the U.S. Congress discussed the aid to China bill last week, Secretary Marshall also admitted that the deterioration of the war situation in Northeast China is sufficient to affect the U.S. position in Japan and Korea. In short, the United States either does not want to maintain peace in the Far East, or it has no other way to go except to help China revive and build the country and become a major stabilizing force in the Far East. If the United States wants to support Japan, it is tantamount to abandoning the broad road and insisting on taking a narrow path. The result will inevitably be self-defeating!</p>

<p>Rare in the World and Deserves Continued Development</p>
<p>[Our Beiping 28th Dispatch] The iron produced in the Shuangtashan Iron Mine in Luanping, Rehe Province, contains a large amount of vanadium, making it a special iron ore that is rare in the world and deserves continued development. According to Wang Zhiyun, Speaker of the Rehe Provincial Assembly, vanadium and titanium are important raw materials for heavy industry. The manufacture of aircraft engines, gun barrels, and warship decks all require vanadium and titanium, and the worldwide production is extremely scarce. According to experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the United States, there are only five places in the world, including Shuangtashan, Hungary, and Switzerland. After inspecting the mine, they were all extremely envious. Since the September 18th Incident, after Rehe was successively occupied, the Japanese fell in love with the mine at first sight. They started mining in August of the 30th year with a capital of 360 million yuan, producing 4,500 tons of iron powder per month. Among them, 50% was iron powder, 25/1000 was a mixture of steel essence and platinum, and 12% was raw material for electrical sources. There were more than 5,000 employees and technicians. However, since the victory, it has been suspended due to the war. Most of the machinery in the mine is still there, with little loss. Officials and civilians in Rehe Province all hope that the central government will restore it as soon as possible, and foreign investment may be introduced if necessary. It is reported that the relevant authorities here have planned to send personnel to investigate after receiving the report.</p>

A hydroelectric power plant is being opened 60 miles north of Guangzhou. Canadian Ambassador Davis recently visited Guangzhou and urged Canadian businessmen to participate in this project. The power generation equipment alone requires US$7 million, and the entire project requires US$20 million. Once completed, the power generated will be sufficient for the entire province of Guangdong and surrounding areas. It is anticipated that a portion of the factories in North China may relocate to Guangzhou and other places in Guangdong, and this kind of electricity is essential.</p>

<p>Execution Awaits Delivery of the Judgment</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 28th] The death sentence for international female spy Jin Bihui (Kawashima Yoshiko) has been approved by the Supreme Court. The judgment was delivered the night before last, and the execution of the traitor Jin is still pending. Recently, there have been rumors that the traitor Wang Yitang will be executed soon, which is a mistake referring to the traitor Jin. The Higher Court of Hebei Province today released the Supreme Court's judgment, the reasoning of which is largely the same as that of the Higher Court of Hebei, holding that the traitor Jin had premeditated for ten years to bring about the demise of her country. The crime of collusion with foreign enemies committed earlier and the crime of treason committed later are of the same nature and should be considered as one crime of conspiring with the enemy to plot resistance against the country. The evidence of the crime is obvious, and she cannot be spared death. There are rumors in Beiping that the execution will be carried out today, and some reporters have been waiting all day at the First Prison. However, according to court officials, the traitor Jin still has the opportunity to file for retrial or appeal, and even if executed, it is still pending. It is reported that Jin seemed quite surprised after receiving the judgment. Therefore, she reversed her previous indifferent attitude and felt fear, suffering from insomnia and loss of appetite, and is still trying to file for retrial.</p>

<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 28th] According to the most reliable sources, the remnants of bandits in northern Shaanxi have not given up their attempts to peek at Yan'an and Yulin, but it is estimated that they do not have much strength. Regarding the joint defense of Sichuan and Shaanxi, the authorities of this province believe that the matter is of utmost importance, because Shaanxi and Sichuan are not only adjacent to each other, but Shaanxi is also a shield for Sichuan. To seek stability in Sichuan, it must start from Shaanxi first. The reporter also learned that the joint defense headquarters to be set up in the near future will include a part of Gansu Province in addition to Sichuan and Shaanxi, covering 27 counties including Hanzhong, Baocheng, Wudu, and Bazhong. The relevant parties believe that the detailed organization and personnel selection have not yet reached the stage of formal announcement. In addition, the joint defense on the border between Shaanxi and Hubei has been implemented, with Laohekou as the core. It is heard that it is not planned to set up a separate new institution.</p>

<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 28th] Wang Yaowu, Chairman of Shandong Province, in view of the serious spring famine in the province, has specially issued three measures to launch a campaign to relieve the spring famine in the province. The measures are as follows: (1) Request agricultural loans, including appealing to the central government for large-scale agricultural loans to handle emergency loans for spring plowing, such as plowing cattle, seeds, and farm tools; requesting the Ministry of Social Affairs to unfreeze food; and requesting assistance from fellow villagers in various places to relieve the spring famine.

<h3 id="e48">Foreign Minister Wang Reports at the Senate Standing Committee on Preventing Japan from Rearming; Prohibition of Restoring Military Institutions in Any Form <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a written report to the Senate Standing Committee on the 28th, providing a detailed report on preventing Japan from rearming, the Korean issue, and the Kowloon incident. The contents are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A. Preventing Japan from Rearming</p>
<p>The plan to prevent Japan from rearming has been passed by the Far Eastern Commission on February 13. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Except for pistols and rifles and hunting rifles permitted by the Allied Headquarters for police use, Japanese people are prohibited from possessing weapons, ammunition, and war supplies.</p>
<p>(2) Except for imports for police use and hunting rifles, Japanese people are prohibited from manufacturing, importing, and exporting weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment.</p>
<p>(3) The manufacture of all kinds of aircraft is prohibited.</p>
<p>(4) The construction of naval vessels and the conversion of merchant ships for military use are prohibited.</p>
<p>(5) Military equipment confiscated from Japanese armed forces or civilians should be destroyed, except for those that can be used for the needs of the occupation forces and Japanese people, can be used for compensation, or can be converted for peacetime economic purposes.</p>
<p>(6) Naval vessels, machinery, and equipment of the United Nations that were obtained by Japan during the war should be preserved and returned to their original countries as soon as possible at locations designated by the Allied Headquarters.</p>
<p>(7) Japanese naval vessels that have been disarmed can be used to send back overseas Chinese or for other measures related to the implementation of surrender clauses.</p>
<p>(8) All military registration documents of demobilized army and navy officers, military police, and secret police should be confiscated and sent to the Allied Headquarters for destruction; Japanese people shall not compile or possess such documents in the future.</p>
<p>(9) Original Japanese military institutions such as the Army and Navy Ministry, the Marshal's Office, the General Headquarters, the Army Education General, the Navy Military Command, the Army General Staff Headquarters, other military and paramilitary organizations, and military schools and military science research institutions shall not be reestablished; the original Japanese demobilization institutions should be abolished immediately; newly established demobilization institutions should be civilian in nature and abolished immediately after the demobilization work is completed.</p>

<p>(12) Except for repatriation and demobilization agencies, Japanese government agencies, public utilities agencies, or educational organizations shall not employ senior military officers and responsible personnel of veterans' organizations, as well as other personnel whose employment would undermine the achievement of establishing peace and security; if such personnel have proven to have anti-aggression behavior in the past and have been approved for employment by the Allied Headquarters, this restriction does not apply.</p>
<p>(13) Implement all necessary measures to prevent the revival of the Japanese army, navy, military police, and secret police.</p>
<p>B. Korean Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the Korean issue, since the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to establish the Korean Commission in November last year, we have sent Consul General Liu stationed in Seoul as our representative. Later, because the Soviet Union refused the commission to enter North Korea, the commission's member and secretary-general went to New York to request the United Nations Small General Assembly. Our government advocates that elections should still be held first in the election area (South Korea) to establish a government. This case has been supported by a majority of countries such as the United States and the Philippines and has been passed by the United Nations Small General Assembly.</p>
<p>C. Recent Developments in the Kowloon Incident</p>
<p>The Kowloon incident is still being discussed for a solution. We have sent Pan Hankui and Diao Zuqian to investigate the Shameen incident. We are now collecting and comparing their reports in detail as the basis for handling this case.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Soviet Union Requests a Military Alliance; Finnish Government Submits to Parliament for Discussion; Preparing to Send Personnel to Moscow for Negotiations <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Helsinki Dispatch on the 28th] It is now confirmed that President Paasikivi has asked all parties in Parliament to state their attitude toward Stalin's request for a mutual defense treaty before next Tuesday. The parties have now begun to discuss the negotiation process for Stalin's proposal. The Soviet note to Finland is expected to be included on the parliamentary agenda as a diplomatic issue around Monday.</p>
<p>[Reuters Helsinki Dispatch on the 28th] Finnish President Paasikivi and the Finnish cabinet met today to discuss the Soviet Union's note to the Finnish government on Thursday of this week, requesting Finland to conclude a treaty of mutual military assistance with the Soviet Union. According to a dispatch from Stockholm, political figures there believe that the Soviet Union's request for Finland to take all possible measures to conclude this treaty, regardless of the instructions issued to the Finnish Parliament, and the Finnish Constitution stipulate that the Finnish President or government shall not conclude military treaties with foreign countries without the full debate and authorization of the Parliament. Among the parties in the Finnish Parliament, only the People's Democratic League, which occupies 49 seats, one-fifth of all seats (i.e., the alliance between the Communists and the left-wing Social Democrats), supports concluding a military agreement with the Soviet Union. However, all other parties unanimously believe that in order to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union, it is necessary to accept the Soviet Union's request. Therefore, it is almost certain that the Parliament will approve the government to conclude a military mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Helsinki Dispatch on the 28th] The Soviet government sent a note to the Finnish government requesting the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries. Well-informed sources believe that the Finnish government will certainly approve it, and a Finnish delegation will soon go to Moscow to begin negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters London Dispatch on the 27th] The London Observer believes that the Soviet Union's request for Finland to conclude a treaty of military mutual assistance with it is not only a diplomatic maneuver to conclude an alliance treaty but also part of its secret military plan. The Soviet Union has always regarded Finland as a fortress, and if it cannot be controlled by the Soviet Union, it will be a springboard for others to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's request did not surprise people here, because the Finnish government delegation's visit to Moscow last November was a prelude to new developments between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador to Finland, Lieutenant General Savonikov, last month further convinced people that a new stage in Soviet-Finnish relations after the war has begun. Although Finland is a country within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, it has so far been able to enjoy the most free treatment from Moscow among its neighbors. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union does not want to be too shocking and drive the Scandinavian countries into the arms of Western countries.</p>
<h3 id="e50">British Government's Policy Toward Czechoslovakia Is Being Thoroughly Reviewed; Czech Exiles Form Anti-Communist Central Committee <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London Dispatch on the 27th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government is conducting a comprehensive review of British policy toward Czechoslovakia. The spokesman also read to reporters a declaration of the Communist Party at the Second Communist International Congress in 1920, which stated that the fixed goal of communism is to destroy parliamentary government. The Communist Party's participation in parliament is not to engage in constructive tasks, but to destroy the parliamentary system of the bourgeoisie from within. The spokesman pointed out that the British government believes that this declaration is a very accurate analysis of the strategy taken by the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Frankfurt Dispatch on the 27th] Czech political exiles said that the Czech secret army has been mobilized to fight communism in the homeland. It is said that the Czech people will use the underground tactics learned during the Nazi occupation during the war. They said that an anti-Communist Czech Central Committee may be established abroad.</p>

<p>[Reuters Prague Dispatch on the 28th] The Czech National Security Police and Labor Self-Defense Corps held a grand parade in the Old Town Square of Prague today, which was personally inspected by Communist Premier Gottwald. In addition, farmers from all over the Czech Republic will rush to Prague on the 29th to participate in the Farmers' Congress to establish the "National Farmers' Democratic Association."

<p>Datina, Benes's political secretary when he fled to London during the war and later Minister of Justice, was found with serious head injuries at his residence outside Prague. According to the police, Datina attempted suicide and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, the "purge movement" continues to unfold actively.

<p>[Reuters London Dispatch on the 27th] Czech Education Minister Nijili ordered today that all schools in the Czech Republic should hang portraits of Stalin from now on. The Ministry of Education will also issue new textbooks on political education.

<p>Saying the Three Countries Have No Right to Interfere in Czech Internal Affairs</p>
<p>[Reuters Prague Dispatch on the 27th] According to a statement issued today by the Czech News Agency in response to the joint declaration of Britain, the United States, and France, the three countries have no right to interfere in the internal affairs of the Czech Republic. The statement also said that these countries often claim that democracy should be applied to international relations, and the most important principle is non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The statement also said that the current political crisis was caused by the resignation of cabinet members from the People's Party, the Czech Socialist Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party, and the solution does not affect the Czech parliamentary system.</p>

<p>[Reuters Paris Dispatch on the 27th] French Foreign Minister Bidault reported on the Czech incident in the National Assembly, using it as an ominous signal after the Munich crisis. Communist deputies shouted and screamed when they heard this. When Bidault said, "France has become increasingly aware of the need for internal unity, and all those who prioritize national interests must unite," the entire audience except for the Communist deputies responded with enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>The National Assembly held a foreign policy debate today. Bidault spoke first, saying, "The French government believes that the recent developments in the Czech Republic have immeasurable significance, run counter to the principles of peace, and contradict the promise to abolish autocracy in Europe. The development of the Czech Republic is one of many similar developments in a systematic way. The closer it is to France, the more dangerous it becomes. The Czech Republic is particularly sensitive geographically, politically, and morally. Historical facts have long fully demonstrated the importance of Prague's position. Not long ago, we still remember that Czechoslovakia was a dangerous signal to the whole world." At this point, Communist deputies shouted and screamed. Bidault paused briefly and continued loudly, "Now the sky over Bohemia is darkening again, and the hearts of peace-loving people are once again shrouded in terror. The drama being played now clearly has new characteristics. National independence has now become the target of attack, and the situation in the Czech Republic will change the international situation. The continuous implementation of these means will eventually lead to extremely dangerous developments.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] A new political group was formed here yesterday, conceived by left-wing socialists and the leader of the French existentialist school, Sartre. The group issued a declaration calling on democrats and the proletariat to unite and strive for the realization of the common program of the Republic. The party calls itself a revolutionary party, but also opposes the Stalinist line and social democracy. Its aim is to oppose capitalism, but also to oppose the "violence against violence" doctrine. The goal is internationalism, but it also opposes Stalinism and so-called "neo-fascism." Based on the above, some newspapers commented that this party is a "fantasy of technicians and intellectuals," and it is difficult to place this party on the political stage. Others say that the establishment of this party will split the Socialist Party, and the rift between the French Communist Party and the Gaullist faction will deepen further.</p>

He said, "Even if they cannot attend for a time, seats in the National Assembly will remain vacant for them."</p>
<p>Menon expressed hope that the election "will begin no later than the first week of May." He said that the United Nations General Assembly has done its best to promote and accelerate the independence of Korea, and the remaining task depends on the political talents of the Korean leaders themselves. He said, "The final form of government must be decided by the Korean people themselves, and the Commission and the General Assembly will be happy to assist Korean leaders in promoting the unification and independence of Korea."</p>

<p>[United Press, Belize, 28th] Amidst rumors that Guatemala will invade British Honduras, British Royal Marines, fully armed, deployed on the western border on the 28th to defend this rich territory. The Royal Marines landed from the flagship "Sheffield" and paraded through Belize before heading west. Hundreds of citizens watched the parade. The general feeling among the onlookers was that Britain did not need to demonstrate its strength, and there were no signs of invasion. However, the British authorities said that the cruiser "Devonshire" may arrive here on the 28th, carrying the elite Gloucestershire Regiment from Jamaica, and its aid will permanently reside in Honduras. Britain and Guatemala have been fighting for Honduras for a hundred years, and this British demonstration has given local residents a sense of impending storm. However, Guatemalan officials denied all rumors, saying that they were spread by agitators from Mexico.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guatemala City, 27th] The Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed to Latin American countries, United Nations agencies, and the Pan American Union last night, continuing to investigate Britain's provocative armed behavior in British Honduras, and asked brother countries to implement solidarity and resist aggression.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The Senate Appropriations Committee today released Secretary of State Marshall's statement to the committee reviewing US-Soviet relations. Marshall said that in normal peacetime relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet government's response to our views is very slow, it is very difficult to consult with them, and they are very suspicious of our intentions. We encounter all kinds of difficulties because of Soviet suspicion. This suspicion is not entirely based on differences in ideology. There is almost nothing we say or do that cannot be suspected. The Soviet Union's suspicion is not false, but if suspicion can be eliminated, the relationship between the two countries will definitely improve a lot. However, even if suspicion is eliminated, our opinions on the evolution of the world will still not coincide with those of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>— North American Newspaper Alliance Copyright All Rights Reserved, Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>The Name "United Nations" Was Born From This</p>
<p>After the Pearl Harbor incident, I almost immediately began to consider how the various countries resisting Hitler and Japan should unite. By now, counting in the Latin American republics that are participating with us in resisting the Axis, there are nearly thirty countries resisting the Axis powers.</p>
<p>My first idea about the unity of the Allies was based on the Lima and Havana conferences on Western Hemisphere affairs. That is to say, when danger develops, united resistance must be organized. In my mind, I wanted to extend this policy to the whole world, because since the Montevideo Conference, I have often said that our Pan-American policy is applicable to the whole world.</p>
<p>I asked my colleagues to trace our relations with Latin America from 1938, review what the President had said about unity among the countries resisting the Axis, and examine the various steps taken after World War I, including unified command and military alliances.</p>
<p>So on Saturday, December 13, 1941, I asked Hamilton (Maxwell M. Hamilton), the director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department, to draft a declaration to be issued by the countries resisting the Axis, which would unite them until victory and should adhere to the basic principles we uphold. The next morning, Sunday, just one week after the Pearl Harbor incident, I met with my colleagues to discuss this declaration and another declaration on the establishment of a Supreme Military Council.</p>
<p>Hamilton drafted two drafts of this Allied declaration, pending adoption. The only difference between the two drafts is that one includes all the Allies, and the other separates the declaration into two. The first is signed by all the Allies except the Soviet Union because it is not at war with Japan, and the second is signed by the Soviet Union as well. We quickly decided to abandon the second draft because we believed that including the Soviet Union with the other Allied countries would be much more effective. After further exchange of views, I asked Assistant Secretary of State Welles, Economic Advisor Vance, and Hamilton to go to another room, include the proposed amendments in the draft, and bring it back to the meeting place. They did so and returned within half an hour.</p>
<p>We now agreed on the main points of what later became the United Nations Declaration. The preamble first reaffirmed the principles agreed upon by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in the Atlantic Charter, and then stated that the countries resisting the Axis "are convinced that their complete victory in the world is necessary for the defense and preservation of life, liberty, and independence, as well as for the preservation of human freedom and justice, not only in their own countries but everywhere else. The struggle they are now engaged in is a common defense against the forces of barbarous tyranny, because these forces are attempting to conquer the world."</p>
<p>Below are the main points of the agreement, totaling three points. Each government must guarantee: First, "to employ its full resources against a government or governments that signed the German-Japanese-Italian Tripartite Pact on September 27, 1940, with which it is at war or may be at war, and to continue to exert its strength in this way until this government or these governments have been finally defeated."</p>
<p>Second, "to cooperate to the fullest extent in all respects with other countries, and to coordinate fully in military efforts and in the use of resources in resisting the common enemy or any one of them."</p>
<p>Third, "never to cease fighting against the common enemy or any one of them, or to sign a separate armistice agreement, unless it is done by mutual agreement."</p>
<p>Here, I feel that we are taking two major beneficial steps forward from the position we took during World War I. First, we are trying to unite all the countries fighting the Axis powers and accept certain principles that have already been stated in the Atlantic Charter. These are the right of all peoples to choose their own form of government; no expansion, no territorial changes opposed by the people concerned; trade and access to raw materials; improved labor standards, economic progress, and social security; international security; freedom of the seas; and disarmament.</p>
<p>When our government participated in World War I, it did not try to bind the Allies to any war goals. Various secret agreements had already been agreed upon by the Allied governments, according to which territorial changes could be made after winning the war. As a result, the Wilson government was severely criticized for failing to seek a common agreement on war goals among the Allies. The problems he encountered at the peace conference were greatly complicated because of the absence of such an agreement.</p>
<p>This time, I felt that the Allied countries should agree on certain principles in advance, leaving the detailed methods of boundary adjustments and other similar issues to be resolved later. If these principles can be firmly clarified and adhered to, then it will be easier to obtain solutions when resolving the details.</p>
<p>Of course, we must know whether there are any secret agreements existing among the Allied countries now. When we raised this question with them, they assured us that there were no such agreements.</p>
<p>Second, this time we are willing to fully connect with other countries resisting the Axis. During World War I, we considered ourselves and called ourselves "participating countries," not Allied countries. The declaration we are preparing now is of an alliance nature, which includes two main points of a general military alliance, namely, to guarantee full support and cooperation in carrying out the war against the common enemy, and to guarantee not to cease the war against the common enemy unless it is mutually agreed.</p>
<p>From December 15th to December 19th, my colleagues and I spent a considerable amount of time revising the draft of this document, which later became the United Nations Declaration. We also discussed another document to establish a Supreme Military Council, composed of heads or representatives of the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Churchill came to Washington. In the following days, the President and the Prime Minister reviewed the contents of the proposed joint declaration and the proposal to establish a Supreme Military Council. Prime Minister Churchill or Ambassador Halifax notified London and asked the War Cabinet to express its views.</p>
<p>On December 27th, the President sent me his written comments on these two documents. Churchill had received the War Cabinet's recommendations on the Joint Declaration, and the President said he had taken them into consideration.</p>
<p>He said, "I think every effort should be made to include religious freedom in this document. I believe it is possible to lead (Soviet Ambassador) Litvinov to agree to this point."</p>
<p>He believed that the wording of the guarantee to continue the war against the Axis would be difficult for the Soviets to accept. This is because they are not at war with Japan. He suggested that the wording be changed slightly so that this guarantee applies to the Axis forces that are carrying out conquest, and with which the signatory country is at war.</p>
<p>The President said he was envisioning a way to make the point that the joint declaration and the Supreme Military Council are two different documents unnecessary.</p>
<p>He suggested that the list of countries presented in the opening section of the joint declaration should list all the countries at war with the Axis, including the Latin American republics. He said, "It seems clear to me that it is beneficial to include as many small countries as possible in the declaration."</p>
<p>The President believed that China and the Soviet Union should be taken out of the alphabetical arrangement and placed at the top of the list with the United States and the United Kingdom. He expressed the opinion that "I have a feeling that the Soviet Union would not be happy to have its name placed after some countries that actually contribute less."</p>
<p>He concluded: "I hope that the wording of the declaration should be given the most careful consideration, especially that part concerning the true purpose of our war, because it is to supplement the Atlantic Declaration.</p>
<p>As soon as you and Halifax are close on the Joint Declaration, I think you, Halifax, the Prime Minister, and I should hold a meeting quickly."</p>
<p>Subsequently, the President convened a meeting at the White House that night at six o'clock, attended by these four people.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the President and Mr. Churchill clearly had not yet reached an agreement on the establishment of the Supreme Military Council. Most of the discussion focused on this topic. So we agreed to adopt the new draft of the joint declaration as a single document, and the draft of the Supreme Military Council would be discussed further.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the President invited Soviet Ambassador Litvinov to come in, gave him a copy, and asked him to forward it to the government for comments immediately.</p>
<p>Two days later, Litvinov came to my office, bringing with him three amendments proposed by his government.</p>
<p>The President agreed to include the Soviet amendments. So I gave him a new draft, which he sent back to me on December 30, with a few words written on the edge:</p>
<p>"CH·OK· Now the Soviet Union and WSC (Churchill) have approved, China has not yet approved. FDR· Let it come out on January 1st. Means to be quick. FDR.</p>
<p>We immediately sent the United Nations Declaration to the governments on the list. At the President's request, I asked the governments concerned to respond immediately so that the document could be published on January 1st. I invited Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi to come in and personally gave him a copy so that he could forward it to the government.</p>
<p>The next day, December 31st, I sent the final form of the United Nations Declaration to the President, asking him and the Prime Minister to sign it themselves. I suggested that the President also invite Ambassador Litvinov and Song Ziwen, who had just been appointed as the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, to come to the White House to sign it.</p>
<p>On the morning of December 31st, when Prime Minister Churchill was bathing at the White House, the President went to him and suggested that the United Nations Declaration should be named the "Declaration of the United Nations." The prominent bather agreed, and the name "United Nations" was born from this. The President re-copied our final draft at the White House, so this new name could be used.</p>
<p>On the first day of the New Year, Roosevelt, Churchill, Litvinov, and Song Ziwen signed this historic document.</p>

<p>Regarding the prices of public utilities in the city, the municipal authorities had planned to adjust them once every two months starting in February. However, since yesterday's announcement of the employee living index suddenly increased to 151,000 times, the sharp increase in various costs has made this plan difficult to implement. The Price Review Committee has scheduled a meeting to be held soon to approve the new prices. It is estimated that this price increase will average around 40%.</p>

In addition, the accumulated surplus goods purchased from March of last year to January of this year will be destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Crackdown on Drug Trafficking Organizations by Korean and Taiwanese Gangs; Police Bureau Completes Half-Month Investigation; Over 3,000 Taels of Drugs Seized; 32 Principals and Accomplices Arrested <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau recently cracked down on a major national drug trafficking case, seizing a total of over 7,000 taels of drugs and arresting 32 Korean and Taiwanese principals and accomplices, male and female. The case took half a month to investigate and was completed yesterday. It is scheduled to be transferred to the District Court for interrogation tomorrow. On the 7th of this month, Division Chief Li Junhou of the Investigation Division received a tip that Lin Huanming from Korea, Xie Jiangrong from Taiwan, and others had established a large-scale drug trafficking organization in Shanghai, which was heavily guarded. It used the name of an import and export trading company as a front. After consulting with Director Sun, he immediately dispatched section chief Feng Qishan, officer Qin Boliang, and other officers to conduct a secret investigation. It was not until 4:00 p.m. on the 15th that they learned that the organization would sell 200 taels of opium, with the contact address being Room 706 of the East Asia Hotel. As the market price at that time was 780 million yuan in legal tender, Director Yu was asked for and approved a portion of public funds to be used for the negotiation. After waiting for four hours at the meeting place, Lin Huanming, accompanied by Bai Bingxian, Zhang Juchu, Qin Beiru, and three others, arrived with a briefcase. After they verified that the legal tender was correct and were about to hand over the goods, the police officers who had been lying in ambush in the rooms on the left and right rushed in, immediately arrested the four, along with the drugs, and brought them back to the bureau for strict interrogation. They confessed that the headquarters was located in a building at No. 1286 Yangshupu Road, and a large number of police officers, accompanied by flying bastions (armored vehicles), were immediately dispatched to search the premises.</p>
<p>Drugs Hidden in Food Cans</p>
<p>At the scene, four Taiwanese individuals, Xie Jiangrong, Jian Zhixun, Jian KuanYu, and Lin Rongsheng, were arrested, and four cans of opium hidden in American food cans, weighing 183 taels and 9 qian, as well as 75 taels in paper packaging and 20 taels of morphine, were seized. Later, based on the confession of Lin Rongsheng, Wang Jinming, a Taiwanese national, was arrested at No. 4, Lane 49, Middle Xizang Road, and 96 taels and 6 qian of canned opium were seized. At this point, Division Chief Li determined that the case was not ordinary and immediately established an investigation team at night, assigning personnel from various sections to fully investigate. On the 17th, it was learned that Lin Huanming and Xie Jiangrong, among the arrested drug dealers, were actually well-known leaders of the Taiwanese and Korean gangs, and that the contact point for the Southern gang was located at Room 316 of the Jinmen (Golden Gate) Hotel, which was managed by Taiwanese national Li Zhuxing. They immediately went there without making a sound. In addition to Li himself, there was also a singer named Ji Jingliang. The two were taken to the bureau, and four letters in Japanese were seized from Li's person and belongings, addressed to the drug distribution points of the organization in Tianjin, Taiwan, Bengbu, and Nanjing. The general meaning of the letters was that the situation in Shanghai had been compromised and that communication should be stopped immediately. When Ji Jingliang was interrogated, she said that she only had a friendly relationship with Li and was unaware of the drug trafficking. Subsequently, Li Zhuxing's residence at No. 7, Lane 674, Tangshan Road was searched, and a secret mechanism for hiding drugs was found under the floor in the attic, seizing 293 taels and 5 qian of canned opium, 36 packets of morphine weighing 381 taels and 9 qian, and a large package of raw materials for manufacturing morphine. In the following days, dozens of perpetrators and suspects were successively arrested. On the 24th, new clues were obtained, and a member of the gang named Tang Shengxuan was arrested at No. 94, North Zhejiang Road, Tiantong Road, seizing 17 packets of morphine weighing 335 taels and 7 qian, 620 taels of coffee essence, and a box of raw materials and various tools for making red pills, 63 million yuan in cash from drug sales, 375 silver dollars, two 10-tael gold bars, two 1-tael gold bars, and gold rings and other items. The next day, another accomplice, Jiang Yulin, was arrested at No. 7, Lane 161, Fengyang Road, seizing 39 taels and 8 qian of morphine and 51 million yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Arrests of Perpetrators in Nanjing and Other Places</p>
<p>At this time, Section Chief Li, based on the letters seized from Li Zhuxing, dispatched officers Boliang and others to Wuxi, Nanjing, Bengbu, and other places to continue arresting relevant perpetrators. Zhang Jingjuan, the wife of Zhang Juchu, was arrested in Wuxi, and 15 taels and 7 qian of opium were seized. Xie Jiangkun, the brother of Xie Jiangrong, was arrested near the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, and 40 million yuan in cash from drug sales was seized. In Shanghai, the officials in charge continued to seize 69 million yuan in cash from drug sales at Xie Jiangrong's house and 41 million yuan in drug money at Wang Jinming's house. Another 7 million yuan was seized from the home of sales perpetrator Yang Yu. At this point, the case has come to an end, except for a few accomplices who are still being pursued by local medical authorities, and is scheduled to be transferred to the District Court for interrogation tomorrow.</p>
<p>Commendations for Officers Involved</p>
<p>The participating officers in this case include Criminal Division Chief Sun Yifang, Investigation Division Chief E Junhou, Section Chiefs Feng Qishan and Feng Xiushan, Officers Qin Boliang, Qian Daxin, Liu Zhaolong, Shao Guanrong, Lu Yixin, Zhang Jingyu, Guo Yuping, Chen Yingming, Ma Bingzhang, Zhang Jianyun, Guo Ruimin, Zhang Yunming, Gao Fuhai, Ding Wenjiang, Ding Zhaogan, Li Yiren, Li Bin, and Chen Xieshou, will be recommended by Director Yu to the authorities for commendation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Military Service Association will propose at the military service conference to be held at the Municipal Council this morning that the central government approve on-site training for the 6,000 recruits enlisted this year in the city. It is generally expected that this proposal will be approved smoothly. The main reasons for this proposal are: (1) The city has military barracks, but new barracks would need to be built if they were trained elsewhere. (2) The quality of recruits in Shanghai is quite high, and they can be used if trained. (3) If the National Army stationed in Shanghai is transferred, the security force will not be reduced. (4) The city is a hub of land and water transportation, with convenient supplies and easy mobilization. (5) On-site training can reduce the recruits' fear. (6) It can serve as a model for new recruit training and facilitate the implementation of military service.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Japanese War Criminal Zhongye Jiuyong, Who Escaped from Prison, Sentenced to Death for Trying to Evade Responsibility for Murderous Atrocities in Military Court <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhongye Jiuyong, the former Chief of the Special High Section of the Chongming Gendarmerie of the Japanese military, who escaped from prison for more than two months and was finally captured, was sentenced to death yesterday after being interrogated by the military court of this city. The main points of the judgment are: "Zhongye Jiuyong is sentenced to death for jointly and continuously massacring prisoners during the war."</p>
<p>At eight o'clock yesterday morning, the military court sent Adjutants Guo Xinfu and Chen Yaoqing, leading a squad of military police, to the police headquarters detention center to bring Zhongye to the Jiangwan Military Court. Zhongye requested to defecate and have a meal, and the military court sent someone to buy him five large pancakes to satisfy his hunger. At 10:30, he was first interrogated by the new warden of the war criminal prison, Sun Jiajun, and Deputy Warden Wang Chengcha. At 11:15, the president of the military court, Shi Meiyu, judges Ye Zaizeng and Zhang Tikun, prosecutor Wang Jiamui, interpreter Wang Renming, and clerk Song Dingya, took their seats. Zhongye Jiuyong, wearing a black and gray long gown and sneakers, with a full beard, gave a very cunning confession. The court first asked him about the motive and process of his escape from prison. Zhongye claimed that he had escaped on his own initiative and that the former warden had absolutely no involvement. The reason for his escape was that the case was "unrelated" to him, and he escaped to "avoid unnecessary sacrifice."</p>
<p>The Escape Process</p>
<p>After escaping from prison, he sold the suit he was originally wearing and bought the long gown he is now wearing on Jiujiang Road for 400,000 yuan. He spent the first night near the North Railway Station. On the 16th, he intended to go to Jiading, but he was inspected by the police at the city gate, who found that he had no identification card and suspected him of carrying heroin because he had two packets of aspirin powder. He was arrested and taken to the local police station, and then transferred to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He was detained in the detention center for eighteen days and interrogated once. When the judge asked him in Chinese if he was carrying heroin, he answered in Chinese. On January 5, he was transferred from the Garrison Headquarters to the local court and detained for more than twenty days. After testing, the two packets of medicinal powder were not found to be heroin, so he was released on the 2nd of this month and started pulling a rickshaw on Zha Pu Road Bridge. The day before his arrest, a merchant-like customer gave him 5,000 yuan for a rickshaw ride and asked him to return 3,000 yuan. He was unwilling to return the money because prices had risen, so they argued. He was arrested the next day.</p>
<p>Persistent Evasions</p>
<p>The presiding judge then asked him about the incident in Chongming when he tied Ji Xuego and nine others with rocks and threw them into the sea, and showed him photos of the skeletons taken at the seaside during the military court's on-site investigation. Zhongye even said that these corpses might be other drowned corpses from the sea that were washed ashore by the anchors of passing ships. The court also asked him that the residents of Chongming often saw him and Datin Zaozhi (already sentenced to death) escorting three to five or seven to eight Chinese people to the seaside at night, never to return. Where did these Chinese people go? Zhongye evasively said, "At that time, a large number of garrison troops often set out to suppress, but there should be no misunderstanding, that is a miscarriage of justice."</p>
<p>The court stated that the case had been tried several times before and the debate had concluded, so the prosecutor stood up and announced: "The case has been testified to by the family members of the victims, Huang Shangda, etc., and an investigation has been conducted with photographs taken, and the evidence is very conclusive. Although the defendant still denies it, there is no denying his guilt. As for the crime of escape, he will not be prosecuted in accordance with Article 233 of the Criminal Procedure Law." At this point, the presiding judge and others retired to deliberate. About five minutes later, they re-entered the court to pronounce the verdict. Zhongye looked nervous. After hearing the death sentence, he said, "Thank you for the fair judgment," with a hint of sarcasm in his tone.</p>
<p>Zhongye speaks very good Chinese with a Shanghai accent. When he saw people from the military court come to escort him at the police station, he knew that he could not escape and said, "I hope to die sooner." A reporter asked him what the purpose of his escape was. He said that he wanted to go to the Northeast to join the Communist Party. After the verdict was announced yesterday, the military court escorted him to Tilanqiao Prison for detention. The judgment will be reported to the Ministry of National Defense and submitted to the Chairman for approval before it can be executed.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Asheng and others were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday for using counterfeit money. According to the indictment, the defendant Zhang Asheng received 50 million yuan in counterfeit money from his cousin Zhou Zhongda on the afternoon of January 30 of this year. He used 1 million yuan to repay the cloth payment to the Deda Cloth Store on Changshou Road. Xu Binnian, an employee of the store, noticed this and sent him to the Putuo Road Police Station for questioning. It was found that the counterfeit money was delivered by Zhou Zhongda. Zhou confessed that he bought it from Lu Huanrong. Lu confessed that he was selling it on behalf of his master, Fang Qiaoxun. Lu Huanrong had a brother-in-law, Ju Tongfa, who was very close to Lu and lived in the same place, but did not report the crime. Lu also deposited 6 million yuan in counterfeit money with Fang Qiaoxun's man, Xu Bao Huang. After the incident, Xu threw the counterfeit money into the garbage dump in an attempt to destroy the evidence. It was all found by the police. Except for Fang Ji Xun, who fled upon hearing the news, the rest were in custody. The defendants Zhang Asheng and Zhou Zhongda were charged with Article 196 of the Criminal Law. Lu Huanrong and Fang Qiaoxun were charged with Article 195 and Article 196 of the Criminal Law. Ju Tongfa was charged with Article 164 of the Criminal Law. Xu Bao Huang was charged with Article 65 of the Criminal Law. They were all prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Chongqing Telegraph Dispatch on the 26th] Since Xiao Yisu, Deputy Director of the Chongqing Headquarters, concurrently serves as the Chongqing Garrison Commander, he has a grand aspiration: the public organization and training in the fourteen counties under its jurisdiction, including Jiangbei, Ba County, Hechuan, Qijiang, Bishan, Tongliang, Yongchuan, Jiangjin, Rongchang, Dazu, Nanchuan, Changshou, Fuling, and Wulong, must be completed quickly. At the organization and training conference convened by the garrison headquarters, Director Zhu Shaoliang began by explaining: "If the public organization and training in each county is secured by the end of June this year, even if the Communist bandits intrude into Sichuan, it will not be difficult to annihilate them on the spot."</p>
<p>Do the Communist bandits actually have the ability to intrude into Sichuan? Zhu Shaoliang once declared in a</p>
<p>Firm Tone</p>
<p>at the conference: "The bandits in Northwest Hubei only have two columns, while the National Army defending the borders of Sichuan-Shaanxi and Sichuan-Hubei has doubled compared to last year. Based on the current troop strength outlook, the Communist bandits have no main force to intrude into Sichuan, but the bandits will definitely not give up their attempt to intrude into Sichuan for support."</p>
<p>Then, which route might the Communist bandits take to intrude into Sichuan? Our newspaper reporter speculates: (1) The 38th Column of Kong Congzhou's bandit troops, entrenched in Northwest Hubei, Zhengxi, attempts to cross the Shaanxi border, Baihe, and follow Xunyang, Ankang, and Ziyang to disturb Sichuan. According to military intelligence: traces of Kong's bandits have been found around Yangweisi, Baojiadian, and Jiaheguan in Baihe. Another group of more than 300 bandits has also intruded into Guanfangpu, Dongjiawan, and Zhuyuanhe near the border of Yunxi and Xunyang. (The above-mentioned places are all north of the Han River)</p>
<p>Kong's Bandit Movements</p>
<p>have been carefully planned. General Fang Jing, who is responsible for the defense of the Daba Mountains, is brave and good at fighting. He is an old cadre of the 18th Army, which was commanded by Chief Chen Cheng in his early years. Currently, the forward command post is located in Daxian.</p>
<p>(2) The main force of Luo Liufu's bandit troops is still in Maliangping. They once advanced west to Xiema River, but countless people died from the cold weather. Currently, they dare not advance west. In addition to preventing foreign bandit intrusions, the most important task of the Chongqing Headquarters at present is to eliminate the</p>
<p>Hidden Bandits in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>According to confirmed information obtained by our newspaper reporter: The bandit forces of Chen Taiyan, who rioted in Wuxi, Fengjie, and Yunyang in eastern Sichuan on January 8, and the bandit forces of Chen Yaojie, who recently disturbed Dazhu, Linshui, and Dianjiang, have been confirmed to have colluded with the bandits. Chen Taiyan's bandits openly marked their X branch, while the "political instructor" of Chen Yaojie's bandits was Xu Yongzhi, the Bao chief of the second Bao in Yangtong Township, Gujiang. It can be seen that the Communist bandit forces hidden in Sichuan Province have reached a point that cannot be underestimated. Therefore, the Chongqing jurisdiction's county-level public organization and training conference, which convened on the 20th and ended on the 21st, is of great significance.</p>
<p>The "Implementation Plan for Public Self-Defense Organization and Training" proposed by Xiao Yisu at the conference is a translation that</p>
<p>Baojia Personnel</p>
<p>must read at this stage. He repeatedly stated: If the counties under his jurisdiction implement it effectively, he will request the headquarters to forward it to the four provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Dian, and Qian for implementation. On the first day of the conference, he introduced the success of the Wanxi Civil Corps and the organizational situation of the Civil Corps in Western Liaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi. On the second day, Chen Hongmo, a former liaison officer of the National Army in Yan'an during the war who has been there for six years and is now the commander of the Ba County Garrison District, analyzed the Communist bandits' public organization and training. Finally, he adopted the</p>
<p>Personally Drafted</p>
<p>plan by Xiao Yisu. This plan, which consists of more than 18,000 words, is divided into ten chapters, including: (1) General Principles. (2) Organization. (A. Registering civilian guns and preparing clappers and gong signals. B. Establishing township, district, and town self-defense conferences. C. Organizing various task forces that do not separate from production. D. Standing squad of forces seperate from production) (3) Equipment, flags, and armbands (A. Weapons and ammunition. B. Various tools. C. Clothing. D. Flags and armbands.) (4) Training. (A. Police squads and security police brigades at all levels. B. Various task forces that do not separate from production.) (5) Peacetime actions. (6) Wartime actions. (7) Expenses. (8) Review. (9) Rewards and punishments. (10) Supplementary provisions. Each small section has a detailed explanation. The most important spirit of the plan is the</p>
<p>Self-Defense Conference</p>
<p>of townships, districts, and towns. The full text adopted by the conference is: 1. Each county (city) shall use townships, districts, and towns as units. The county (city) mayor shall solicit opinions from all parties and elect the chairman of the township, district, and town representative assembly and two to three representatives elected by the assembly. Local leaders and outstanding military officers in the countryside shall organize the township, district, and town self-defense talks. The township, district, and town chiefs shall be the chairmen, and the chiefs of each Bao must participate. The conference shall not exceed eleven people and shall be the highest authority for handling public self-defense below the county (city) level.</p>
<p>Xiao Yisu is known for being consistent in word and deed. Under his iron fist, the jurisdiction will definitely be able to achieve: "Internal bandits have no place to hide, and foreign bandits have no way to invade." (Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou Telegraph Dispatch on the 27th] The Fujian Provincial Government hosted reporters this afternoon to elaborate on the issue of setting up a roving lecture and assessment group for the mobilization to suppress the rebellion. Regarding the former, all counties in the province have decided to universally build pillboxes in order to save troop strength and strengthen defense.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dongtai Telegraph Dispatch on the 25th] Since the National Army dispatched troops to clear the remaining bandits on the coast a few days ago, the bandit army has been defeated.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Ningbo Telegraph Dispatch on the 26th] The spring fishing season has arrived. Except for large pairs of boats that have already gone to sea, other large net boats will soon start fishing. Coastal fishermen, due to rising prices recently, have seen the cost of fishing gear and wages increase accordingly. One top of a fishing net requires 30 million yuan. Boat crews are paid in rice, and monthly wages for three months require about ten stones of rice per person. Each boat with five people needs fifty stones of rice, so the salary alone requires more than 100 million yuan. Adding in various fishing gear, the capital required is 450 million yuan. Government fishing loans and fishing bank loans are limited and cannot solve the problem. This year's spring fishing season, fishermen are unable to go to sea for fishing due to lack of funds, and a large number of fishing boats on the coast of Zhejiang Province will inevitably be reduced, and the lives of fishermen are very worrying.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Wuxi Telegraph Dispatch on the 27th] Regarding the case of auditing and collecting business tax, the County Tax Collection Office suddenly sent personnel to inspect the account books of shops a few days ago, causing dissatisfaction and difficulties among the general merchants and people.

At this morning's general assembly of the County Council, there were four proposals on the case, which were merged and discussed and decided: (1) Tax collection through account inspection should be handled by the government in accordance with the actual situation of each industry, so as not to impose excessive burden, because the current tax rate is unreasonable. (2) Business tax is one of the county's finances, and the government should try its best to cooperate with the county's budget in its collection amount, and it is hoped that the number can be reduced to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. (3) The Legislative Yuan's Ministry of Finance should be telegraphed to amend the current business tax law, which is not practical. (4) Since the business tax has been approved by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference and all of it has been listed as county-level tax revenue, the Executive Yuan should be telegraphed to issue a notice to implement it as soon as possible to avoid disputes. Also, whether half of the tax revenue for this year from January onwards still needs to be transferred to the province should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions. (5) The work of sampling account books that is currently underway should be temporarily suspended by the county by letter.</p>

<p>[News from the China News Agency] The National Education Experimental Zone of this city, in order to reveal the historical evolution of basic education and to review teaching methods, has jointly organized the "Preparatory Committee for the Basic Education Exhibition" with famous figures from the education circles of Beijing and Shanghai. Zhu Jingnong was appointed as the chairman, and Chen Heqin, Du Zuozhou, Wu Yan Yin, Ying Qianli, and more than fifty others were appointed as committee members. It was originally planned to hold the Basic Education Exhibition on April 4th, Children's Day, but due to insufficient preparation, it was scheduled for May 5th. Now, with the coordinated support of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs, as well as the enthusiastic cooperation of UNESCO and the British and American embassies in China, they have agreed to collect relevant basic education materials from abroad and transport them to China to participate in the exhibition. In addition, about a hundred units, including cultural institutions, schools, and social organizations in Beijing and Shanghai, have been invited to form working groups and cooperate in a comprehensive and extensive manner. The Preparatory Committee has held several meetings and believes that the scope of the exhibition has expanded to an international nature, and its purpose is not only to promote basic education but also to strengthen sincere cultural cooperation between countries through educational methods and promote the world citizenship movement based on basic education principles. All facilities are not being carried out carelessly, and it has been finally decided that the Basic Education Exhibition will officially open on October 10th, National Day. The entire school building of the Municipal Women's Normal School on Yuanyuan Road will be used as the venue. According to Chen Heqin, the general manager of the Preparatory Committee, the scope and far-reaching significance of this Basic Education Exhibition are unprecedented in the history of Chinese education. Therefore, all measures must be taken carefully. The specific exhibition methods are roughly divided into (1) static object exhibitions (walls, desktops, three-dimensional objects, real objects, models, charts, teaching materials, etc.) and (2) active educational performances (teaching demonstrations, children's activities, music and drama performances, adult activities, etc.). The exhibition hall is divided into five parts: (1) primary school education, (2) kindergarten education, (3) adult education, (4) special children's education, and frontier education, with special attention to basic education facilities in various countries, comparisons, and performances of some representative basic education special facilities. Chen Heqin said that the preparatory work is still in its initial stage, and he hopes that the social and educational circles will fully assist in making this a grand event.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The attached elementary school of the New Land Normal School plans to implement three improvements this semester. (1) Kindergartens and grades 1 and 2 will make full use of time and space and change to a full-day system, breaking the tradition of five and a half days of classes per week and having six full days of classes per week. (2) Because there are not enough classrooms, three of the elementary school's eighteen classes will have a holiday every day, adopting a system of alternating holidays for children and teachers, abolishing the weekly holidays. According to the person in charge of the school, if this system proves effective, it can be promoted to the whole city. If all national schools in the city adopt this system, without increasing school buildings and classrooms, the number of enrolled children can be increased by 50,000, which is indeed a good way to rescue out-of-school children in this city. (3) The Teaching Affairs and Moral Education Departments will be merged into the Teaching Guidance Department in order to achieve the goal of integrating moral education and teaching, and department heads will be added at each stage to be responsible for the moral education and teaching affairs of each stage.

<p>After the rice price in the Nanshi Market fell back on the previous day, it was lower than that in the Beishi Market. The owners started to raise the price, and the asking price was generally higher. The morning market was the most popular, and the price outside the market once increased by more than 100,000 yuan. At the close, it was heard that the Beishi Market was weak, so it also softened. Bai Geng once again hit the 3 million yuan mark, Zhongdao was 2.95 million yuan, and Zaodao was 2.9 million yuan, each rising by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Because the price in the Beishi Market was higher than that in the Nanshi Market on the previous day, the price fell back slightly. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell Wuhu Xian, allocating it to 2,218 rice shops, distributing 13,655 shi, the same as the previous day. Also, yesterday, the price increase in the Nanshi Market was more severe for Xian rice. Wuhu Xian and Cao Xian each rose by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour Rapidly Declines</p>
<p>The quotation in Wuxi fell sharply, and the Shanghai market was also affected. People's confidence was low, and the owners rushed to sell. At the opening, Hongfeng flour immediately fell to the limit of 1.292 million yuan, once as low as 1.28 million yuan below the limit. Although it still rose back to 1.3 million yuan, it finally retreated to the limit of 1.292 million yuan. Jiancheng flour also fell to the limit of 1.282 million yuan. Although Lao Che and Bingshan did not fall to the limit, they also fell slightly by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Bran fell sharply by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Only wheat remained at its original high price.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Fluctuates</p>
<p>Yesterday, people's confidence was still stable, but because the rice price rose, the owners took the opportunity to raise the price. Also, because it was Saturday, the street collected more goods, and sales were still active. Soybean oil was all in the form of return trading. Da You soybean oil opened at 6.25 million yuan, but the market was slightly weak later, at 6.2 million yuan. Other soybean oils such as Shunyu and Changde were all priced at 6.15 million yuan, each rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was weaker later. Sheng oil opened early, rising by 100,000 yuan. Qingdao Jitong Sheng oil opened at 7.1 million yuan, and Taian Jitong Sheng oil was priced at 7 million yuan. However, the market turned weak later, and it could not be sold. Shengcai oil and other oils rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Jitong Xiaoche sesame oil stood at 7 million yuan. Soybean cake price was low and sales were active, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Vary</p>
<p>Because oil factories saw soybean cake rising, they rushed to collect yellow beans. Hankou Zha beans rose from 1.6 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan. Other types of yellow beans rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Shengren supply and demand were equal. Qinhuangdao Shengren opened at 4 million yuan, rising slightly by 50,000 yuan. Jinbang sesame still had no intention of buying. The owners raised the price to sell, and the two sides held their ground. Finally, due to sluggish sales, it fell by 150,000 yuan to get rid of stale inventory. Jiujiang NaiDou opened at 2.8 million yuan, and there were not many transactions. The market for corn was unpredictable. It jumped wildly in the morning and then fell sharply yesterday. No guest helped with the purchase. Qidong corn opened at 1.95 million yuan, a decrease of 250,000 yuan compared to the previous market. Hongliang followed with a decrease of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Tanqing decreased by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Lüdou rose by 150,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Yarn Management Committee held its fourth committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th), with Chairman Yuan presiding. After each department reported on its business, the proposals were discussed. The main resolutions included ratifying the "Temporary Suspension of Yarn and Cloth Forwarding Measures to Stabilize Yarn and Cloth Price Increases" and the "Contract to Entrust Cotton Merchants to Purchase Cotton," and decided to expand the implementation area for the unified purchase of cotton from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou to all regions where the committee has offices. It also strengthened the committee's control over raw cotton.</p>
<p>[Another report] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 29,620 bolts of cloth and 110 bed sheets, with 859 purchase orders. Except for the 30 bolts purchased by manufacturers, the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.</p>
<p>The Yarn Market Was Initially Weak but Turned Strong at the Close</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was characterized by a large amount of supply due to the continued distribution of goods by the Textile Construction Company, resulting in abundant chips on the market. Moreover, due to the end of the month, many bulls closed their positions, and the market sentiment suddenly declined. However, the chips for 41s and 32s were relatively scarce, and the market sentiment was firm. Towards the close, practical manufacturers from both local and foreign areas took advantage of the low prices to replenish their stocks, and the market slightly improved. As a result, 42s Jianfeng fine yarn rose by 2 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 123 million yuan. In addition, most of the 40s intermediate grade continued to weaken. 21s Shuangma, both spot and warehouse receipts, rose by 500,000 yuan. 20s middle grade, only Jincheng was firm, and the rest weakened by 800,000 to 900,000 yuan to 2 million to 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was characterized by general weakness in the morning, and due to the end of the month, the money supply was tight. Many industry players sold short, and retail investors also sold a lot, resulting in a decline in asking prices. However, at around 10:15, the northern gangs absorbed the low prices, and dye factories also came to purchase. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 2.7 million yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Also, Blue Chicken and Trumpet Boy fine cloth rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan due to factory searches. Private factory native cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth, etc., were adjusted by the factory due to the 50% increase in the cost of living, and the market sentiment was firm.</p>
<p>Cotton Registration Deadline Today</p>
<p>The registration for the purchase of national cotton by the Shanghai Cotton Association on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but there are still a few trading houses that have not registered with the association. The association decided to extend the deadline to 4:00 PM today, and will be open as usual on Sunday.</p>

<p>The rayon market continued to decline yesterday. At the opening in the morning, 120s Xu Zi Youguang was as low as 44 million yuan, once reaching 7 million yuan, but the closing price fell to 6 million yuan for the selling price. In the afternoon, the sentiment was softer and the market continued to weaken, finally falling to 3 million yuan for the selling price. The factory market also showed a slight decline yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the transaction price for C-grade was 65 million yuan. The payment terms were only two to three days, and there were several dan sold at 5 million and 4 million yuan higher than the zero-loss price. Because yesterday was Saturday, the transaction was very quiet. There were no transactions for other grades, and the asking price was also shortened accordingly.</p>
<p>The silk market was firm after declining yesterday. Huajiang Zhensi Beimian opened at around 7 million yuan, once hitting the 70 million yuan mark in the middle, but the closing price finally fell to 8.5 million yuan. Dacheng Gezi Chou opened at around 85,000 yuan, and the closing price was 90,000 yuan. Minsheng Jingfang Ni, the factory price was 380,000 yuan, and the street's purchasing was very active. The market for other goods was firm yesterday.</p>

<p>The sugar market continued to soften yesterday due to the wait-and-see attitude of actual sales. The current price of No. 24 crude white sugar was lowered by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan by the association, the same decrease for No. 45 medium sand white, and 150,000 to 250,000 yuan for No. 20 medium sand white. Native sugar also loosened accordingly, with the cost of production already becoming inverted. Xinghua white sugar was priced at 3.5 million yuan, Xing Chi at 2.52 million to 450,000 yuan, and Diao Qing at 2.4 million yuan, a decrease of 400,000 yuan from the highest peak. Hainan Chi was 2.5 million to 450,000 yuan. The transaction of warehouse receipts was still not deserted, with the price decreasing by 150,000 yuan in the middle, but it still recovered later. As a result, the August contract rose by 50,000 yuan, and the September contract was similar. The Taiwan dollar was long by five yuan, at 142 yuan.</p>

<p>The tea market fluctuated on the original path from morning to close. Although sellers of various varieties intended to raise the price, they gradually reached a saturation point after rising for several days in a row, and there was a lack of stimulating news. Therefore, the process seemed to be unable to improve. As for transactions, export tea was still unwilling to move because exporters felt the price was too high. Internal sales, however, were still good in the street and the Suzhou-Wuxi area, so the buying interest had not subsided, and the transaction volume was not weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of Yanbai coal in the fuel category continued to rise due to the lack of supply and the unusually active market, with stocks decreasing.

<p>Also, in the firewood and charcoal market, chestnut firewood and pine firewood were stable. Charcoal prices increased due to the increase in the cost of living and labor costs, and because residents were eager to buy, Qing charcoal rose sharply by 100,000 yuan per dan, to 680,000 yuan, white charcoal to 600,000 yuan, and black charcoal to 480,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 10%.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stocks were still in a clearing-out phase. Yong Yarn was sold off due to large inventories, and there was no beneficial buying to support it. It was getting worse and worse, and it was at its lowest point at the close. Only Lian Di rose to the limit. Guohuo was stable, and Jinglun also began to rebound after rising. It is difficult to have any prospects for development for the time being. The morning opened weakly due to the unease of industry insiders the day before. Yong Yarn debuted at prices of 1,050 yuan and 1,080 yuan, and then rose to high prices of 1,080 yuan and 1,095 yuan. The market price outside the venue still opened at the original price. The money supply was slightly tight, and it fell to 1,037 yuan and 1,065 yuan. Lian Di was listed as rising to the limit at No. 162, and Yong Yarn was advanced to 1,045 yuan and 1,080 yuan. There were still inspections outside the venue, and it fell again to 1,020 and 1,050 yuan. Although there was support at low prices, the afternoon closed at low prices of 1,018 yuan and 1,047 yuan.

<p>[Our Report] Regarding the matter of merchants delaying payment of taxes on declared imported goods, and the implementation of a new method for collecting late payment fees, it has been approved by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented on a trial basis for six months, effective immediately. The details of the method were announced yesterday by the Jianghai Customs as follows: (1) Customs import duties (including surcharges) and the commodity tax collected on behalf of the government must be paid within ten days from the date the Customs issues the tax payment certificate. (2) For overdue payments, a late payment fee equal to one percent of the import duty (including surcharges) and commodity tax shall be charged for each day of delay. (For delays exceeding thirty days, a late payment fee equal to two percent of the import duty (including surcharges) and commodity tax shall be charged for each day from the thirty-first day onwards, until the original tax is paid.) (3) The extension fee for extending the tax payment deadline, currently the responsibility of the import shipping agent, will continue to be collected according to regulations. However, for goods removed from the Customs warehouse that have not been taxed within fifteen days from the date the tax payment certificate is issued, the extension fee for extending the tax payment deadline will be levied. This extension fee will be abolished from the date of implementation of the late payment fee method. (4) For tax payment certificates issued before the announcement of the above method, the payment period shall be limited to ten days from the date of announcement of this method. Overdue payments will be subject to late payment fees.</p>

<p>— Xu Ren</p>
<p>I have lived in the city for more than ten years, and recently had the opportunity to go back to my hometown. I have never been particularly fond of Shanghai, disliking its congestion and annoyance, disliking its particularly numerous rumors. Once an accident occurs, it is always exaggerated several times and spread around. Some arguments are obviously completely unfounded, but everyone believes they are true, and special classes push the wave, sometimes even making the rumors become a reality. The environment of Shanghai is very suitable for these special classes, but it does not seem to be very suitable for those who are content with their lot. This is why I do not like Shanghai. However, although I do not like it, I have lived here for more than ten years, which is really unexpected. Therefore, when there was an opportunity to return home, I went happily.</p>
<p>I had not taken a train for many years, and had only heard people say how crowded and inconvenient trains were. So, I tried to arrange in advance to buy a ticket to Hangzhou. But when I got to the station to buy the ticket, I found that it was not as inconvenient as I had imagined; when I got on the train, I felt that the passengers were not as crowded as I had imagined. Perhaps this was due to the train schedule, or perhaps it was due to the season.</p>
<p>Since last year, the railway authorities have added reserved seating trains. Although the fares are more expensive than ordinary trains, the seats are more comfortable and the journey is faster. This method did not seem to exist before the war, so it is an improvement. However, there is one thing I do not quite understand: why do not other trains also adopt the reserved seating method? Of course, I also know that "reserved seating trains" are intended to be different from other trains, just as ordinary trains are divided into first, second, and third class. But the classes can be divided into first, second, and third class, just as trains can be divided into express, ordinary, and slow trains, and this does not prevent reserved seating on tickets. It is naturally difficult to provide all passengers with seats when transportation is a problem in our country. My method is: for all train seats, whether they are "tourist cars" or first, second, or third class cars, as long as there are still vacant seats, and they are not "full", the railway authorities should issue reserved seating tickets to all passengers. Only when there are no more vacant seats should ordinary non-reserved tickets be sold. This will definitely avoid the disadvantages of unnecessary scrambling, which is one benefit; secondly, this method can prevent passengers from traveling in higher classes than they have paid for. The biggest reason for scrambling to board the train is to grab a seat; once the reserved seating method is implemented, everyone will know in advance whether they have a seat or not; those who have not bought a reserved seating ticket will naturally know that they will not be able to occupy a seat, so there is no need to rush; those who know they have a seat will naturally not have to rush. Another problem on trains is that, according to the estimates of the ticket offices at the stations, there are obviously empty seats in the first or second class carriages, but because the second or third class passengers are too crowded, they see that there are empty seats in the first or second class, and the third class passengers crowd into the second or first class carriages, and the second class passengers naturally crowd into the first class carriages when they see that there are no empty seats. In this way, the passengers who bought first or second class tickets do not have seats. Strictly speaking, this is a violation of the law, but this situation is always due to the "scarcity of resources", so the words must be said so seriously. However, it is true that those who bought first or second class tickets should have been able to occupy a seat, but they have no seats due to other passengers traveling in a higher class than they have paid for, which is quite unreasonable. Adopting the reserved seating method can avoid this drawback. In terms of ticket prices, there is naturally no harm in differentiating between reserved and non-reserved seating. I remember that theaters in Shanghai did not adopt the reserved seating method in the early years; later, reserved seating was only available for more expensive seats; now, theaters all have reserved seating. This small matter of theater tickets shows the traces of gradual progress. The method of reserving all train seats will definitely be adopted in the future, this can be predicted, but there seems to be no reason why it cannot be implemented immediately, I wonder if the railway authorities are willing to consider it?</p>
<p>But after the train started, the scenery along the way was pleasant, and my heart was relaxed. I will not dwell on this. I will just say that I got off the train at Hangzhou City Station and changed to a bus of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to cross the Qiantang River Bridge. The Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus has the opposite bank as its terminal. If you want to go to Shaoxing, you must transfer to a long-distance bus from Xiaoshan to Hui'e. Such a short distance - from the city station to the river, the journey takes about 45 minutes - is inconvenient for passengers getting on and off the bus. The long-distance bus of the Xiaohui section had already started before the war. The reason why the end point was at the riverside at that time was because the Qiantang River Bridge had not yet been completed. Now that the Qiantang River Bridge has been opened to traffic, why not change the terminal to Hangzhou City Station? The reason for this is probably that the Xiaohui section of the bus and the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus each have their own considerations. In fact, allowing the Xiaohui section bus to take the city station as the terminal would not have much adverse impact on the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus, because only passengers going to Ningbo and Shaoxing would squeeze onto the Xiaohui section long-distance bus. People whose destination is only at the riverside will naturally still take the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus. I think that for the convenience of passengers, it seems necessary to reform this segmented defect. Although this is a small matter in terms of travel, I firmly believe that social improvement is cumulative and is brought about by accumulating bit by bit; improving this small defect of segmentation is a bit by bit in a big improvement. At present, due to the ravages of war, our country's transportation has been fragmented enough, but that can be said to be unavoidable, but why should we divide it in cases where it is not necessary?</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus to the riverside seems to pass Maojiabu on the shore of West Lake, I am not sure; you can also see a long embankment in the lake, I do not know if it is the Su Causeway or the Bai Causeway? You can also see a village on the shore of the lake, I do not know if it is Wang Village? In my opinion, the scenery of West Lake is most simple and pleasing in the corner of Maojiabu, but unfortunately the time is short, so I only caught a glimpse. This section of the road in Hangzhou seems to have another branch road leading to Wuyun Mountain, because I saw a road pavilion on the bus. I waited for the bus and sheltered from the rain in this road pavilion on my way to Wuyun fifteen years ago, and it is still intact. About five minutes after the bus passed the corner of West Lake, it arrived at the Qiantang River Bridge.</p>

<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>A relative who lives with someone as a tutor came to me this day and sent me two bottles of French perfume and two boxes of American-made tonics, which made me confused. This relative came to Shanghai originally to take the university entrance examination, but because the documents were not yet complete, he could not take the examination, so he took the next best thing and became a tutor in preparation for taking the examination in the autumn. Of course, the tuition of a tutor is enough to maintain his own life, but it is quite poor. If the food and lodging were not in the student's home, enjoying the privilege of "having wine and food, the teacher's meal", he might have to pay for it himself. However, I was very puzzled by the gift he sent, even if it was a gift for the New Year, there was no need for such a grand gift. I know that the market price of this kind of French perfume is more than 2 million yuan per bottle, and the cost of the two bottles of tonics is also more than a million gold. Could it be that my poor relative, in addition to tutoring, is also doing import and export business, and therefore the profits are huge, and he gives away such valuable things casually? My suspicion may be an excessive concern for this younger generation of relatives, and finally I opened the doubt in my heart with the following question:</p>
<p>Me: Have you been doing a side business besides tutoring recently?</p>
<p>Relative: No, I just read some books and prepare for the entrance exam when I'm not tutoring.</p>
<p>Me: (Looking at the gifts on the table) Then you're too wasteful, buying such valuable things -</p>
<p>Relative: (Interrupting me before I finished) These things are readily available.</p>
<p>Me: Readily available? Alas, you should put them away as hoarding goods, it's not easy to save money to buy something.</p>
<p>Relative: I don't have extra money to hoard goods.</p>
<p>Me: Then why are you so wasteful to buy perfume and tonics?</p>
<p>Relative: I don't need to hide anything in front of you, these were given by the family I tutor, and I don't use them myself, so I give them to you.</p>
<p>Me: Then this family you tutor is pretty generous.</p>
<p>Relative: It's true that they are generous. They usually buy countless odds and ends, including daily necessities, medicines, canned food, etc. The day before yesterday, they spent two and a half days trying to sort them out, but they still didn't finish. Some things, such as cigarettes and canned food, were already moldy, rusty, and inedible, so they were thrown away as garbage. Some cod liver oil had already deteriorated, so they were also thrown away casually. Therefore, the head of the family felt that in order to quickly clear out the old stock, it was necessary to give them away in large quantities, so as not to waste things. Not only did all the servants in the family receive gifts, but even the lowly tutor was benefited. Like this kind of perfume, the storeroom was filled with two layers of display windows, with all kinds of varieties. As for foreign tonics and Western medicine, they were even more full of boxes and chests. In fact, when the family's children are sick, they never take ready-made medicine, they always go to the pharmacy to get a prescription.</p>
<p>Me: (I didn't answer, which led my imagination to a fantastical realm...)</p>
<p>Relative: The head of the family said that these many things made him annoyed, and he would feel happy after clearing them out, otherwise he would not be able to buy anything to bring home in the future.</p>
<p>The conversation ended here. I think the annoyance that the head of the family said is worth pondering. Since he is annoyed by "having too much", it is better to be poor and happy. Whenever the cold current strikes, there are always dozens or hundreds of "frozen bodies on the road", no wonder the rich are annoyed by the stink of wine and meat. This kind of stink is the thing that the rich find the most annoying and troublesome. The world today is such a disparate picture.</p>

<p>— Jin Youyu</p>
<p>Seven friends went back to the hotel to drink, and when they were about to leave, they received a bill for 700,000 yuan, so each person gave the waiter 100,000 yuan. When the waiter went to the cashier to pay the bill, the cashier suddenly realized his mistake, only 600,000 yuan was enough, so he returned 100,000 yuan to the waiter. The waiter thought that it was difficult to divide 100,000 yuan among seven people without small bills. Anyway, they didn't know the correct amount, so he would give them each 10,000 yuan, and the remaining 30,000 yuan would be his extra income. So he gave each of them 10,000 yuan, so in reality each of them only paid 90,000 yuan. Let's calculate: seven times 90,000 is 630,000 yuan, plus the 30,000 yuan hidden in the waiter's pocket, totaling 660,000 yuan, and the seven people paid a total of 700,000 yuan, so where did the other 40,000 yuan go?</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Human Heart is Like a Mirror <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jinjin</p>
<p>American New York magazines have a special column dedicated to collecting all kinds of "small news", adding annotations as appropriate. Those with obvious meaning are no longer annotated. For example, one issue contained a piece saying:</p>
<p>"Decatur Sex Crimes Now Held in Check"—See Decatur News headline</p>
<p>"Decatur Sex Crime Wave Not Yet Checked"—See Same-Day Decatur Free Press Headline</p>
<p>At first glance, it seems to create a sense of contradiction. On closer inspection, it may be due to different perspectives and viewpoints of the reporters. I often feel that the human heart is like a mirror, some are convex lenses, some are concave lenses, the light intensity is different, and the things reflected are naturally very different. I once heard Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhao argue aimlessly about a film at a banquet.</p>
<p>Zhang: "In this film, the male lead is too old, not worthy of playing the role of a romantic young man, and the plot is simple and boring."</p>
<p>Zhao: "No, the song and dance scenes in the film are great, and the colors are gorgeous. It's worth seeing just for Bodil Hedegaard's dances and songs."</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang has his reasons, and Zhao has his reasons. Zhang likes to watch plot-driven movies, and Zhao likes to watch song and dance movies. The film itself may be good or bad, but mostly because the standards of the viewers are different.</p>
<p>In a special example, someone can't help but be happy when they see a fire truck passing by on the road, because they specialize in selling the remaining clothes for insurance companies, from which they get a commission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the same thing elicits different images in the hearts of different people. People who are vegetarians and abstain from killing often buy cattle and sheep to release them, while Indians regard cows as sacred, and it is not uncommon for cows to swagger down the street while pedestrians avoid them on the side of the road. But to a foodie, the first thing they think of may be steak, or a bowl of well-seasoned spiced beef.</p>
<p>Also, everyone's views on colors are quite interesting. Young women like to wear red, while older people tend to wear dark colors. The late British writer G.K. Chesterton had no complaints about light blue in his essay "Talking About Shirts," saying it was the color of the sky. But he was very dissatisfied with red, calling it "the fading of roses and the reduction of fire," and saying that light red socialists cannot achieve great things, implying that he was criticizing fence-sitters and opportunists. Chesterton's richness of association seems to be evident here.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven Full of Doubts (83)</p>
<p>As for Feng Sheng, she thinks that she has no fate with me. As for Yun Qing, he still thinks that my divorce from Yuan Sheng was for her sake, and now she may be having a good dream. As for Aunt Wang's suspicion that I am with Yun Qing, which Qi Zhi saw and caused aversion, it is not unreasonable, but I have not been with Yun Qing recently. As for the family, no one knows about these things. Zhu Zhai thought about it back and forth and felt that what Aunt Wang said was not worth paying attention to. But why did Qi Zhi get close to Director Miao, and why did she change towards herself? This melancholy gourd really made people feel uncomfortable. Zhu Zhai used all kinds of speculation, but could not find a reason. In the end, he decided that when he saw Qi Zhi, he did not need to mention anything else, just persuade her not to get close to these military men. As long as she could realize it, or she could say why she was associating with the Miao surname, all the problems could be solved. Zhu Zhai held this idea and returned to the dormitory next door in the evening. He called several times to inquire, but Qi Zhi had not yet finished her record. The next day, he called again to inquire, but Qi Zhi still had not returned. This time, Zhu Zhai's mood was not as panicked as last time, but only increased jealousy, knowing that Qi Zhi was staying out all night, always restrained by the Miao surname. In this way, there will be many messy things in the future. With her stubborn personality, she cannot be disciplined, and she does not have the corresponding financial resources herself. In the future, everything will have to depend on her. If this is the case, will it not be far from the original intention of getting to know her that day! After these three days of work, Zhu Zhai was only loving and caring for Qi Zhi, fearing that something might happen to her, and then pitying her, it was really difficult to be understood. Therefore, after calling to inquire on the second day, he was no longer as enthusiastically concerned about her as before. On the third day and the fourth day, he called once in the morning. When he heard that Qi Wan had not returned, he no longer made the phone call. It was not until the fifth day that Zhu Zhai saw the news in the newspaper, which said, "A newly arrived important official, after arriving in Ping, became infatuated with a famous actor, and his reputation was tarnished. Recently, a foreign reporter revealed the matter to the authorities with pictures, and the authorities were greatly angered and decided to investigate and deal with the matter seriously. It is heard that the relevant authorities have received this order, and Director Miao was first given a major demerit and ordered to thoroughly investigate and report the matters he handled..." When Zhu Zhai saw this news, he felt that the three words "a famous actor" were very glaring.</p>
