<h3>立法院長　五選辦法對過　首次選票印全體立委名單　篇幅之大將為世界選票冠</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立法委員互選院長，副院長，定十七日晨第六次預備會議舉行。吳鐵城十五日下午在第五次預備會議中提出報吿，並徵詢各委員意見，會中有人主張因議事規則尙未訂定，互選應向後順延，江一平謂：總統·副總統已定廿日就職，爲使行政工作可迅即推進，立法院長·副院長，應如期於十七日互選，當經全塲無異議通過。至議事規則能否於十七日前通過，尙不影響互選之進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立委互選院長·副院長辦法，十五日第四次預備會中已全部通過，立院秘書處刻正趕印選舉票。據悉：依照互選辦法規定，第一次選票應印列全體立委七七三人之名單，立委姓名係以四號鉛字排印，選票篇幅之大，將爲全世界任何選票之冠。其大小較對開　紙張　小，而較四開報紙　張爲大。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立委互選院長·副院長投票及開票辦法，十五日下午亦經第五次預備會議順利通過，僅在文字上作極微之修正。第五次會議於下午三時半開會，出席委長一七四人，吳鐵城主席，當即逐條討論投票·開票辦法，僅將第三條中「票匭四個」之「四個」二字，改爲「八個」。孔庚主張　五條憑當選證書領取選票改爲憑出席證書領票，但遭否決，其餘各項均無異議通過，僅四十分鐘即宣吿散會，投票·開票時之監察員，亦經各單位於會後分別推定。</p>
<h3>第四次預備會　討論情形</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立法委員互選院長，副院長辦法，經四日之討論，始於十五日晨由第四次預備會議通過。十五日晨討論時，各委員對草案所提修正意見極多，然表決結果，僅對原條文作兩處修正。第四次預備會議仍由吳鐵城主席，宣吿討論互選辦法，多數委員主張逐條討論表決通過，衆無異議，起草委會召集人胡庶華說明修正案增列改選條文之要旨後，開始逐條討論。討論標題時，即有李伯申，陳達晨，陳顧遠，鄒樹文，郭天乙，張子揚等提出意見、有主張改辦法爲規則者，有主張改互選辦法爲互選改選辦法者，然經表決後，仍照原題通過。討論條文時，於第二條，第四條，第五條，第八條，均展開激烈辯論。第二條規定選舉須有立委總數五分之一以上出席方得舉行，吳尚　指出立院組織法無「以上」二字，應予删去，此項修正獲得通過。張匯文主張出席者須有二分之一以上，趙憲議主張三分之一以上，但彼等意見均遭否決。第四·五兩條規定選舉票第一次列全體委負名單，第二次列第一次得票較多之首二名，第一次選舉須獲過半數之票數爲當選，第二次則以得票較多者當選。四·五兩條合併討論，楊不平，劉先雲，苗啓平，黃肅方等咸主張第二次選舉時，選票仍應印列全體委員名單，以符互選之旨，有人且認爲第二次僅列兩名爲變相提名。許蟠雲謂，選票印七七三人，不僅選票碩大無期，且有若干單位因未選出而留空白，均欠妥當，渠建議另行寫票，而於選票外另附全體名單，邊疆委員之技術困難則另謀解決，然此數項修正意見均遭否決，仍按原案通過。第八條規定改選辦法，爭執最久，原定須經全體委員五分之一以上之提議，出席委員過半數之通過得予以改選，若干委員認爲提讓人數名額規定過多。邱昌渭首先發難，謂爲保持一貫精神，只須卅人提議即可，朱惠淸、，劉士篤等主張詳細規定應改選之情况，武誓彭，田雨時主張改選至少須在選出六個月以後，黃哲眞主張同一會期不得爲兩次改選，意見紛紜，反復辯論，最後主席歸納各委員意見後，遂一表決，僅通過五分之一以上之提議修改爲十分之一以上之提議，其餘均遭否決。除上述四條外、其餘五條則均無異議，互選辦法至是始吿全部通過，至十二時五十分散會。</p>
<h3>立院議事規則草案　提預備會議取決　起草會工作經激辯後吿一段落</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立院議事規則起草委會十五日晚八時三刻舉行第四次會議，召集人雷殷主席，首由十三人小組召集人陳顧遠報吿該小組於下午三時開會經三小時半對起草委會三次會交付重行審査修訂之各事項之研討結果，旋即據以再予討論。關於第五章「讀會」中之三讀會問題，以旣經二讀會通過之法案，除非三讀會出席委員過少，決無再遭否決之理，故仍以使各委員能儘量出席三讀會參與表決之方式，加以補救，因增加一條，「第三讀會應於第二讀會之翌日或一次會議行之，但主席經徵詢出席委員同意後得於第二讀會同日行之。」第十章「聽取報吿與質詢」中關於規定質詢之條文，經訂正爲「質詢之提出以說明其所質詢之主旨爲限，質詢之答覆不得超出質詢範圍之外，前項質詢不得作爲討論之議題」。第十二章「秩序」一出席委員先行退席者不影響法定人數之計算」一條，除於法定人數之前加「開會」兩字外，並在第七章「表決」中增加一條，限定於會議進行中經發現在塲委員不足法定人數時，不得將議案揭付表決。最後討論至第八章「同意權之行使」，第二三兩次會議及十三人小組中屢屢爭論之塲面又復重演，結果小組提出之修訂文及其他删改意見均未通過，決定不再開會討論而將四種不同意見並提全院預備會議取決。（一）甲案爲小組綜合日昨會中各方意見提出之原修訂文計四條：（一）「依憲法第五十五條行使同條權時應由全院委員會議審査後提出本院會議投票，前項全院委員會議出田委員互推一人爲主席」；（二）「前條全院委員會如認爲必要，得咨請總統通知所提人提出施政及用人意見」；（三）「依憲法第一百零四條行使同意權時適用第五十二條之規定」，（按第五十二條即即（一）（四）「同意權之行使其議決應採用無記名投票方法）。（二）乙案爲陳海澄等提議將甲案（二）之末「及用人」三字删除。（三）丙案爲陳顧遠等提議，將甲案（二）全條删除。（四）丁案為陳博生等提議，將甲案（一）（二）（三）條槪予删除，代以「總統依憲法第五十五條第一百另四條之規定提出人選於本院時，院長應逕提本院會議表決之」。甲案（四）條仍予保留。關於「同意權之行使」之辯論，經三日長時激辯，終無結果，然經包華國，杜光塤兩氏舉憲法精神說服後，現已無人對行使同意權時應先獲悉被提行政院長人選之施政與用人　見一點，再提「遠憲」之論，此問題於預備會議提出時勢必引起更劇烈爭執。至葉溯中一再提出之委員資格審委會組織及院長副院長選舉辦法兩部分併行列入議則之主張，則以可另外規定僉認毋庸訂入議則。會議至十時三刻始畢。議則起草委會之工作方於戰　認眞之四日研討　論後，吿一段落。</p>
<h3>孫科首次出席　產院預備會議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕孫科十五日晨首次出席立院預備會議，坐於委員席次以後之九八七席次，閱其所携來之世界電訊（Warldgram）雜誌及英文報紙。渠對互選院長副院長辦法之討論情形似不甚注意，閱讀迄未間斷，十一時半休息時，孫氏即徐步出塲。</p>
<h3>赴大連美領過境護照　蘇外部突予簽準　僱商輪專駛大連計劃臨時取消</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處本市訊〕美國國務院原擬使特約之商船一艘專駛大連一次，以便將美國領事館人負與供應品載往大連，但今晨在該船準備開出之數小時前，忽接到莫斯科蘇聯外交部之正式通知，准許簽准美國領事館全部人員之護照，通過海參崴，而再由海參　前往目的地，職是之故，特約商船一艘專駛大連一行之計劃，已予取消。按柏督克領事與克雷斯丁副領事在上海等待蘇方簽准護照及運輪工具，　前在海參崴然後再往大連，業已數月。經長時期之遷延而猶未獲得必須具備之蘇聯護照及旅行權之後，國務院核准特約船隻一艘，駛往大連，俾將美國領事館人員以及當地領事館所需之充份供應品運往，並將柏契副領事及其家屬載回。爲此，曾徵得中國政府之特別准許，使埃　萊德輪船公司之「沿海優勝者」號得駛往大連一次。按該輪原係經常駛行於朝鮮與上海之問者，特約該輪專駛大連一行之計劃係於昨日完成，而原定於今日開出。</p>

<h3>國敎經費問題</h3>
<p>— 邱</p>
<p>敎育最高當局於四月十四日出席國大報吿敎育情况時，　宣稱敎育部今後擬全力推行國民敎育，所以在本年度中央敎育總預算中列入基本教育補助費八千億。同時行政院通過國敎　費整理及增籌辦法：如將國民學校經費列入縣以下特別預算，舉辦學榖捐，發動臨時樂捐，整理學款學產等。足見政府已決心寬　國敎經費以推行大衆需要的基本敎靑。我國新敎育一向是運反大衆利益的敎育，是一使　人出錢，給　人子　　　，富人子弟畢業後，再回去剝削窮人和窮人子弟的一種敎育」。近十年來這種反民主的情形是加倍嚴重的了，少數富人子弟所獨享的高等中等敎育呈露空前膨脹現象，但最大多數納稅人的子弟所需要的國民敎育則痿縮到極可憐地步，從社會正義上說，這是極不公平的。所以政府普及義敎和寬　國敎經費的政策是値得擁護的。但過去幾次普及義敎運動的失敗都由於有計畫而無經費或有經費而不善保管。存計書而無經費，則計劃等於具文；有經費而不善保管，則經費多爲不肖官吏所中飽。所以如何增闢財源和如何妥善保管是國敎經費上兩個重要問題。</p>
<p>過去寬籌國敎經費的辦法，都是支支節節的，今後似應採用統一而有效的增關財源之方策。第一，我們希望政府實行憲法第一六四條「敎育，科學，文化之經費，在中央不得少於總預算百分之十五，在省不得少於百分之二十五，在縣市不得少於百分之三十五」的規定。只要能實行這條，則中央和地方敎育總預算將大量增加，國敎經費亦跟着增加了。第二，我們希望政府在中央和地方敎育總預算中規定國教經費應佔的比數。根據美國一九三四年　敎育經費統計，在每個十七分錢　敎育經費中，有十二分錢用　小學敎育上，三分錢川中　敎育上，二分錢用在大學敎育上。換句話說，在美國全部敎育預算中，國敎經費佔百分之七十，這是頗合理的比數。根據這個標準，我國似可暫時作如下規定；中央對各省的　敎補助費不得少於其敎育總預算的百分之三十，各省對各縣的國敎補助費不得少於其敎育總預算的百分之四十，各縣市對各鄕　　　敎補助費不得少於其敎育總預算的百分之五十，各　　　　　　費則不得少於其敎育總預算的百分之九十。第三，我們希望政府仿照法國支給小學敎師　金辦法，規定各級政府應負祖小學敎師薪津的比數。每一小學敎帥的薪津似可由中央補助十分之一，省補助十分之二，縣補助十分之三，鄉鎭担負十分之四，都照物價指數隨時調整。最後，行政院所規定的舉辦學榖捐，樂捐，整理學產等方法亦可採用，但最根本辦法是舉辦敎育稅，由敎育參義會規定稅率並獨立徽收之。</p>
<p>國敎經費來源旣已充沛，則次一問題即爲如何保管它的問題。保管目的，在消極方面，爲防止舞弊中飽；在積極方面，爲指導正當用途。過去中央和各省國敎補助費差不多全被不肖官吏中飽了。省敎育行政人員常將這兩項補助費的大部分移作別用，如編印敎科書，開設書店，統購機器，實驗新敎法等，甚或用以經營商業，其他漁利辦法極多，不勝枚舉。但是最大弊端為國民學校數目的浮報，因爲省縣都可藉此領得上級政府更多的國敎補助費。例加東南某省於十年前已呈報有二萬餘保學，但據專家估計，目前實有保學數尙不到其呈報數的十分之三。筆者於數年前視察該省某縣行政時，縣政府呈交國民學校表格一厚册，其「模範鄕」一表中載有十五個國民學校的名稱，地址，校舍佔地畝數　各校長和敎師姓名，學歷，薪額，兒童班男女生數目，成人班男女生數目，經臨各費數目等，應有盡有。但實際調査結果，該模　鄕僅有一個國民學校，其餘十四個學校的名稱，校長和敎員姓名，學生數目，經臨各費等全是捏造的，但這些學校每月應領經費則已爲縣政府用許多假圖章具領無誤。笨者少見多怪，曾在會議席上報吿實情，並請予該縣縣長以申斥處分，但大家認爲各縣情形都是如此，專罰該縣長一人似欠公允，於是筆者恍然大悟，亦啞。無言了。其實中國烏鴉一般黑，某省並非例外。過去十幾年來中央和省國敎補助費經層層剝削，其能流到國民學校敎師手中的款便微乎其微了。至於鄕鎭保的國敎經費則多爲土劣所把持，其舞　花樣比較其縣太爺並無遜色。</p>
<p>防止中飽與指導用途的有效辦法，當然是敎育行政的民主化。從敎育經濟的觀點來說，所謂教育行政的民主化，就是讓人民參預教育經費的微收，保管與支配，使大衆出的錢，在辦理爲大衆謀幸福的敎育上，能生產最大效能。爲實現此理想起見，中國敎育學會曾建議政府，成立各級敎日參議會，由人民票選各界領袖和敎育專家若干人組織之，其有關敎育經費的職權爲決定敎育政策，審査敎育預算，規定敎育稅率，微收敎育稅，保管敎育專款，審核決算，接受控訴，彈劾或罷免敎育官吏等。省縣敎育參議會的成立可防止國敎經費的中飽與浪費，因爲各級政府國敎補助費及其他專款都由該會收領，保管並分發於各單位，銀錢不經過敎育行政人員手中，他們似無法作弊，即使有舞弊情形，該會可於審核決算時發見其　洞，人民亦可向該會控訴，不肖官吏是要受處分的。敎育參議會的成立，不僅能防止中飽，而且能指示正當用途。因爲它在決定敎育政策和審査敎育預算時，已將國敎經費的用途確定了。若敎育參議會一時尙難成立，則省縣參議會中，似可設置敎育經費管理委員會，由該會選聘若干參議員，社會賢達，與敎育專家組織之，國敎補助費可由該委員會保管，分發並隨時公布其收支情况。各保亦可設置敎育委員會，由人民票選若千人組織之，保管國民學校校產和經費並每月公布其帳目。所以敎育行政的民主化是保管國敎經費之最有效的辦法。我們要能增關財源和妥善保管，國敎經費問題才能解決，普及國敎的計劃才能實現。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統宣布　承認以色列新國　仍願努力促成阿猶休戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十五日廣播：華盛頓訊，白宮消息靈通人士稱，杜魯門總統刻正考慮，必要時撤消對巴勒斯坦軍火禁令，並考慮與以色列國臨時政府談判建立外交關係。白宮新聞秘書羅斯吿記者招待會稱，政府承認以色列臨時政府，各方反應極為良好。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統今日正式宣布美國在事實上承認巴勒斯坦猶太國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統十四日宣佈，美國承認巴勒斯坦之新猶太國。在巴勒斯坦之猶太國宣佈成立，於十四日東方日光節約時間下午六時零一分生效後數分鐘，杜魯門即發表聲明稱：「美政府曾接獲通知，猶太國已在巴勒斯坦宣佈成立，該臨時政府並要求加以承認。美國承認此臨時政府爲以色列新國事實上之政府」。美國之予以承認正在英國之巴勒斯坦委任統治正式終止之時。白宮新聞秘書羅斯談稱，新猶太國之誕生及美國之加以承認，並不减低美國促成阿猶休戰之努力。「美國促成巴勒斯坦伏戰之願望，絕不因猶太國宣佈成立而减低。吾人希望猶太新國將會同安理會之休戰委員會加倍努力於促成戰爭之終止。戰爭之終止，爲美國在聯合國討論巴勒斯坦問題整個階段中之主要目的」。杜魯門之決定在兩日來曾嚴守秘密。國務院內階級較低人員對此項聲明均感詫異。一般之迅速反應爲美國已採取快速行動較蘇聯佔先一着。此間官員曾認爲蘇聯或將於英國委任統治終止及猶人宣佈成立新獨立國之時，爭先承認「事實」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕白宮宣佈承認以色列事，使杜魯門總統自就職以來即感煩惱之問題達於頂點。最近數月來，此爲杜魯門在選舉年內，內政與外交政策方感覺麻煩之原因，本日之承認猶太國實際上即承認分治計劃爲已成專實。杜魯門此舉顯使許多國會人士感覺驚奇。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕關係方面相信美國政府之承認猶太以色列國，係以國內之政洽原因爲其背景，杜魯門總統此舉意在彌補杜魯門政府放棄支持巴勒斯坦分治計劃後，民主黨在今秋大選中獲勝機會所受的打擊。紐約州固擁有數百萬之猶太選民，承認以色列國，用意殆在博取此等猶太選民之歡心。</p>

<h3>潛伏共匪續有捕獲　多數為交大畢業生　陶龍等五人已供認　市長招待記者報吿經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午五時在市府招待各報記者，報吿本市逮捕共匪事件稱：最近二月來，向治安當局自首之共匪，已有卅五人，大部皆因已對共黨失去信心，感覺沒有前途，心理發生動搖、故乃紛紛自首。政府對潛伏本市共匪之處置方法爲：（一）鼓勵自首，保障彼等自新之路。（二）如仍執迷不悟，定予設法捕獲，按戡亂時期違害民國緊急條例移送特種刑事法庭處理。最近數日內，治安當局即根據此一原則，捕獲一潛伏之共匪張良彩（女，廿四歲，吳興人，交大畢業，現任啓明女中理化敎員）。又根據其口供綫索，繼續即獲五人，其姓名爲陶龍（男，廿五歲，紹興人，交大畢業，現任中國農業機械公司實習工程師），陶堯（男，廿五歲，無錫人，交大畢業，中國農業機械公司實習工程師），劉繼明（男，廿六歲，　海八，交大畢業，中國農業機械公司實習員），陳玉（女，交大畢業），蔡英（女，非交大畢業）。吳市長稱：此數人現均已離校，並非在校學生，非在校中逮捕，且皆有切實證據。其中除陳五尚在訊問外，其餘均已承認。</p>
<h3>交大學生推代表探詢　市長出示口供自白書</h3>
<p>交通大學學生爲此事曾於今日（十五日）推裘維裕。黄舒培二敎授及校友會代表李開第，來市府詢問經過情形，當吿以此事與學生無關，政府對學生及學校當局原無解釋之必要，但爲表明政府光明態度，仍以張良彩等之口供自白書出示三人。三代表閱後，返吿學生，認爲此事與現在交大學生並無關係。</p>
<h3>供詞自白書摘要</h3>
<p>張良彩·陶龍·陶堯·劉繼明等人之自白書供詞摘錄如下：陶龍供稱，三十六年十一月·十二月間，我已在公司內做事，陶堯問我願意參加共產黨嗎？這因爲我們在校時都是級代表，開會時常常見面，彼此意見都甚統一，畢業後都至公司任職，他介紹一本書給我看，那是新人生觀，我看後說出感想，他便問我對共黨的看法，我的答覆他很滿意，但進一步和我談家庭狀况，於是問我願意人黨嗎，我說願意，他叫我寫</p>
<p>一篇報告，包括家庭狀況，個人經歴等，約三個月後才正式參加。宣誓完後，便正式入黨，開會。我們支部內共有三個人，陶堯。劉繼明和我。我們經常談共黨理論問題，陶堯有時帶赤色書籍來給我看，或看了書名叫我們買了看。我們開會約一二週一次，在劉繼明家次數多，在劉繼明自已房間內。</p>
<p>陶堯供稱，數日後有人找我，是姓張，他呌我數日後拿一本紅的書在提籃橋匯山戯院門口等他，那天有人踏了自行車來，他到我家內談話，問我家庭及學校情形，我都講了。後來又來一次，隨使談談，二週後換了一個人</p>
<p>姓林名英以後終是他來看我。他說：我們是參加技術部，叫我把畢業的同學團結起來，我便找劉繼明·陶龍，（中央銀行俱樂部聚餐之後），他們也同意了。</p>
<p>張良彩自白書摘錄：最後他說有一個十分政治性的團體，經常嚴　計劃和檢討工作，互相帮忙，共同學習，你願否參加，我說願意的，他就說這團體是中國共產黨。我並不怎樣驚異，因爲從前已有人叫我加入過。於是他呌我寫一篇自我介紹的報吿，報吿寫了幾個星期，到十一月中才寫完。十一月廿九日陶來，說我的加人業經上級通過，拿出一張紙，上書：（一）革命利益高於一切，（二）我願終身爲共產主義事業奮鬥，（三）堅決執行決議，（四）嚴守黨的紀律，（五）終身爲羣衆模範。</p>
<p>夜校快結束時，才和黨內敎，部門接上關係。在這次前我很想到解放區去，因爲（一）啓明工作好像沒有前途，而陶却說這是我的中心工作。（二）搞冬靑的活動自感不適宜。（三）對女工夜校有興趣，但陶說這不是中心工作，是附帶做做的。</p>
<p>M和我聯緊了幾次，談過</p>
<p>兩個指示一個是關於時局的「反劉航琛和平大同盟」，一個是關於學運的，檢討過去學運，指示今後原則（主要是在生活性民族性問題上堅決發動羣　運動，打破羣衆對國民黨的幻恕，使　衆把生活痛苦和美國的侵略與國民黨的統治，結合起來）。有一次是介糾我自己，有一次是介紹啓明，對於我的工作，M說重心　敎　部門的學生工作，以後就談啓明工作而夜校。有一次是談一個指示（主要是：一九四八年是暴動年，如年初的申九事件，同濟學潮，和自發性的舞潮。五月是高漲而非高潮，渡江也並不是勝利的到來，配合五月高漲，我們要加緊組織　衆，在落後羣衆中爲勝利準備一個後備軍等等）。</p>
<p>劉繼明供詞摘錄：我因與陶堯</p>
<p>私交甚密便相信他的話，去年十二月初，他與我談入共黨問題，我答應入黨，他呌我寫一篇報吿，述明家庭狀况，個人經歷等，我也答應了，但因生病，很久才寫好，給他後，他說上面　許參加，便陶與龍一起在　家　宣誓。</p>

<p>昨日男女游泳決賽，又有新紀錄產生，男子二百公尺接力賽，馬華隊以一分五十七秒一之成績，破廣東隊所保持之二分一秒一全國紀錄。男子一百公尺游泳決賽，馬業馮朝玉則以一分十六秒九，破劉寶希所保持之一分廿三秒三大會紀錄。游泳紀錄，迭被擊破，共計破全國紀錄有五項，破大會紀錄者一項，平大會紀錄者一頂，可謂收穫豐滿。男女總分，男子組香港以七十三分　冠軍，馬華五十四分獲亞軍，女子組香港亦以七十分得冠軍，亞軍則為臺灣，得二十五分。昨日為游泳賽及各項球類比賽最後決賽之一日，觀衆人山人海，如潮擁至，各塲均滿坑滿谷，尤以體育館及游泳池為最，情況之熱烈，為全運會揭幕以來所未有。</p>
<h3>籃球大會戰　最後幸運之星　屬於上海男女　臨了五分鐘中　雙雙躍登王座　男：五四比四九勝菲　女：四八比三九勝菲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕萬目睽睽之男女籃球錦標循環賽，十五日在體育館共舉行三塲。下午二時開始，第一塲爲女子籃球上海對菲律濱，上海隊求勝心切，登塲即呈慌張，遂使菲隊獲分累累，至第三節尙居下風，末節追成平局，乃乘菲隊力竭心慌，始能排除頹勢，卒獲勝利。結果上海以四十八比三十九，擊敗菲律濱，獲得女子籃球冠軍。　隊雖敗，表演不弱，萬餘觀衆深留良好印象。</p>
<p>次爲男籃賽，以情勢緊張，球迷爭先恐後，均欲一覩健兒身手，比賽時間爲下午三時起，而有於十時前即在體育館門前等待者，十一時啓門，觀衆蜂擁而入，警衛雖多，亦被突破數次。一時未到，館內即告滿座，計約萬餘人，館外尙有球迷萬餘，未得其門而入。</p>
<p>男籃首塲爲聯勤對警察，結果五十八比四十六，警察敗北。</p>
<p>第二塲爲上海對菲華，有甚多球迷均作賭注，聞某君竟以十億元代價博菲華必勝。此役本報事前會一再預示，如上海　結合作，則可獲勝；如菲華心理緊張，則菲華終將敗北。昨戰上海隊有出乎理想之合作表演，菲華初頗鎭定，旋即緊張，平局後延長五分鐘時，心理緊張尤甚，故以五十四比四十九，上海終吿勝利。</p>
<h3>女籃緊張局面</h3>
<p>女籃兩軍接觸，石宗　遝球入敵方籃下，隻手投中，明媛隨後擲入，秀枝帶球撞入，明媛兩罰俱未鵠中，如蘭擲入、宗蘭又投中，滬隊六比二佔先。宗蘭與劉佩珍互撞，球證判雙方犯規，各無所獲。中圈跳球，淑瓊打手犯親，慰玲未罰中，明媛，錦雲，先後犯規，如蘭秀枝共罰取三分，迫成六比五。滬隊後衛爲菲隊擋人戰術所窘，王珊面紅耳熱，三個後衛累得團團轉，連傳交前鋒的球亦失却準則，幾次擲到界外。如　雙于瞄射，玉潤依樣葫蘆，明媛奮不顧身穿入籃底，投入一球，第一節滬隊以八比九落後一分。</p>
<p>菲隊領前　第二節　玲擲中，貽情犯規，宗國兩罰中的，一度以十二比九超出，菲前鋒擋人戰術運用巧妙，逐步迫近籃下，秀枝，玉潤，接連擲入，滬隊僅由宗闌，明媛，各獲一球，此一節結束，十九比十六，仍菲隊領前。</p>
<p>玉潤於三節開始不久即投入，滬隊王維珍傷足，王務醴入代，石宗蘭擲入，　玲兩次失却籃下絕佳之投入機會，秀枝射入，成二十五比十九。宗　投中，明媛再增二分，追成二十三比二十五。玉潤得心應手，近投遠射，俱皆中的，滬隊遂又落後。維珍再入塲，務醴下野，明媛一擲，慧玲罰中，第三節完，三十一比二十六，上海仍落後五分。</p>
<p>上海卒勝　未一節，王珊犯規，玉潤兩罰皆中，宗闌罰球亦得兩分，秀枝射入，三十五比二十八，形勢危急，幸宗蘭獲中，此時菲隊劉佩珍五次犯規出塲，惡玲明媛先後近籃投入，追成三十四比三十五。菲隊施愛珠入塲未向裁判報吿，判處罰球，明媛一擲而入，竟成各三十五平手，四座黨聲如雷，如蘭遠射中的，宗蘭兩次投入，反以三十九比三十七超出，王珊亦以四次侵人犯規被判離塲，務醴入代，宗蘭再增兩分，菲隊頻頻換人，無濟於事。明媛如猛虎出柙，直　敵陣，菲隊陷入慌亂，投籃屢次偏失，四十七比三十七，時間無幾，上海隊勝算在握，動作從容不迫，　瓊犯規出塲，施曼珠入替，明媛罰中，秀枝擲入，隨即完場。滬隊卒以四十八比三十九，奪得錦標歸。</p>

<p>聯勤對警察之戰　先於下午三時揭幕。王士選帶錄入陣，盤旋敵營良久，　與賈志軍，跳起擺入。警察傳其俠力奪一球，遙射亦中。　勤五人快攻抵警察籃下，球爲警察與新運所奪，運入敵營，聯勤竟是「空城計」，新運遂怡然獲得兩分，四比二警察佔先。移時王蓉生犯規，賈志軍罰中，傅其俠又犯規，士選罰中，聯勤閃電式攻勢，又聞觀衆呌好廖滌航跳起未開花，警察何增犯規，曹志吉罰中，其俠志軍雙犯規，志軍罰中，成六比四。鄭大光啣球疾進，警察後衛衝出防禦，鄭雙手端起球又落綱。傳其俠拼力反攻獲兩分，廖滌航跳起仍未開花，聯勤三鋒勇猛殺入，作直綫堅强傳遞，觀衆鼓掌呌好不絕。警察王伯文入替吳新運，何增即中兩分，曹志吉還他一球，王士選犯規，王伯文罰中，成九比十，相差一分，是後雙方各有進展，二十四比十九，聯動佔先上半時。</p>

<h3>上海菲華之戰　局勢千鈞一髪</h3>

<p>觀衆狂喊　余進犯規，震中罰入，乃成平手，觀衆狂喊狂呌，歷時一分鐘。但菲方余進偸營刧奪一城，吳慷慨擋球撞入，成章罰中，金德又犯規，震中過度用力未罰中，菲隊　停。蔡文華雙手托進，十比九，滬隊反佔先。菲隊情　，五人均殺奔上海陣營，球爲忠强截得，運往敵陣，不愼絆跌，失一良機，球迷大喊「啊喲」！蔡文華遙射落荒，包松圓亦兩射未中，陳金德跳起射獲兩分，十一比十菲又佔先一分。文華再投未中，陳金置又得兩分，十三比十，球迷振奮異常，吳成章截得籃下球，送與震中，震中遙傳與成章，成章於邊綫　進。</p>
<p>球迷屏息　斯時戰事緊張，球迷屏息注視，包松圓假門牙被打落，就地滾躍　起，掙扎托入一球，滿座稱淤。胡秉坤人替慷慨，包松圓反手射入；李震山彈與吳成章，吳躍起雙手送人籃筐，十八比十三，上海超出五分。　德犯規，文華罰中，金置隻手奪一城，成章雙手遙射入筐，二十一比十五，上海佔先六分。李世僑入代余進　　聲大作。李震中易出，　以蔡演雄，栽判以上海故意拖延時間，罰技術犯規未中。吳成章帶進一球，李世僑穿入命中，蔡忠强竄獲兩分，二十五比十七，上海仍佔先。包松　犯規，胡秉坤罰中，十八比二十五，李世僑拉手，成章未罰中，二十五比十八，上海佔先上半時。</p>
<p>拼命反攻　下半時開始，球迷大鼓掌，大叫菲華加油，是時上海祭連科易蔡演雄，文龍易成章，臨戰前，菲隊五人互抱互祝努力獲取勝利。忠强獲球作蛙跳射入一球，　座鼓掌不絕。陳金置亦奪得一城。金德打入，文華未罰中。菲華再度求停，雙方聚首籌議戰略，菲余進易蔡金與，余上塲即立一功，金德又中，二十四比二十七，相差三分。菲華拼力反攻，李世僑衝入重圍，突破一城，包松圓救球犯規，陳金置兩罰俱中，乃成各廿七平局。文華獲球急射獲中的斯時緊張萬狀。震中，成章復上，易出屠文能與包松圓世僑犯親，文華罰中，三〇比二十七，相差三分。文華雙手舉起，球又入筐，余進還以顏色。文華又中，菲金典易出秉坤，金德犯規，忠强罰中，三十五比二十九，金置單手托入，再添兩分，又成各卅五。包松圓易出連料，陳金德又進一球，余進錦上添花，三十七比三十五，菲華反佔先。</p>

<h3>國際田徑對抗賽　中華健兒大獲全勝　齊沛林擲鐵餅更上一層樓　以四二·一五公尺破全國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全運大會錦上添花，國際田徑對抗友誼賽，昨日在大會田徑塲舉行，由此次全運田徑優勝選手，與本市西僑選手作對抗賽，節目共計十五項。除二百公尺及擲鏈球二項，被西僑代表獲勝外，其餘各項，中華隊代表大顯身手，獲得全勝。</p>
<p>選手齊沛林（全運會註册時誤「林」爲「霖」）及董飛星兩人，復創造全國新紀錄者一項，全遝大會新紀錄者二項。齊沛林擲鐵餅以四二·一五公尺，擊破其本人在本屆全運會中所創之四一·五五公尺全國新紀錄；推鉛球復以十二·九一公尺之成績，擊破其本人此次所創之十二·七二公尺全運大會新紀錄。跳高選手董飛星，亦以一·八二公尺之優異成績，破大會跳高紀錄，皆屬難能可貴之收穫。</p>
<p>昨日項目中四百公尺臨時因西僑人選不足取消，另增加二百公尺低欄一項。新項目則有擲鏈球比賽，此項在我國全運會中未曾列入，亦我國從不練習之比賽。昨日含有提倡及表演性質，我國代表吳振武居然創有四三·四七公尺之成績，洵屬不易。</p>
<p>本市西僑遝動選手，人才　洛，參加者不多。接力跑隊伍皆爲　凑成軍，故昨日比賽，並不計分，每項錄取四名，僅記錄個人之優勝而已。</p>
<h3>田賽收穫最珍貴　標槍殺出程咬金</h3>
<p>田賽項目共七項，分上下午順利比賽究畢。其過程如次：標槍決賽於十時半起舉行，與賽者共十餘人。碧眼兒中不乏彪形大瑛，惟擲來格格不入，僅美童公學享迪克遜，於數擲後，始勉强入四十米關，其餘盡屬中華健兒之天下。海軍王學武，腿傷未愈，試擲數次，亦得四六·九四公尺之成績。惟王君放棄計算名次及成績，故不列矣。台灣張星賢，本以四七·六五公尺佔先，孰料空軍黄任遠，半路裏殺出程咬金，一　得四七·九二公尺，壓倒　雄，且勝過全運標槍冠軍陳濟川之成績。陳君昨以赴京，朱及代表參加，黄君被臨時拉夫代表，居然不辱使命，可賀可賀。名次如下：（一）黄任遠（二）張星賢（三）徐天德（四）王瑞。</p>
<p>鐵餅決賽　與賽者共六人，中二外四。齊沛林聲勢煊赫，首擲即得四二·一五公尺、較渠本人在本屆全運會時所創造之四一·五　全國新紀錄。再　　·六〇公尺；碧　兒們個個　　　　。空軍王瑞，鐵餅脫手時，總是「嗯」的一聲，成績倒也不弱，得第二。美海軍史密斯，金剛似的幹兒，好看不中用，與西靑鮑來分佔了三四位。</p>
<p>鉛球決賽　下午二時起舉行，共七人參加角逐，天津齊沛林隨手擲來，即得一二·九一公尺，較其在本屆大會所創造之一二·七二公尺大會紀錄，更進步，一九公尺，老齊眞可人兒。合灣兵名傳、殺氣　騰，拼力擲來，亦得一二·六五公尺。美海軍史密斯，祗得一二·三〇公尺，退居第三；第四名爲吳振武（海軍）。</p>
<p>跳高決賽　與鉛球決賽同時舉行，共六人起跳。其中陸軍劉夢九，祗試跳個人成績，不計名次，故實僅五人，自一·六〇公尺起跳，個個跳過。加到一·六五公尺，西靑赫斯，傑脫列士兩人，三跳未過，碧眼兒全遭淘汰，淸一色中華健兒比跳成績。横竿高至一·七八公尺時，僅董飛星一人揩油過去，張立人楊基榮三跳未過，亦吿敗下陳來。再加至一·八二公尺，飛星一次未過，二次如鷂子翻身，輕易過得竿去，淸晣美觀。飛星野心勃勃，一加即至一·八五公尺，二跳均吿敗績，終以一·八二公尺之紀錄，鳴金收兵。名次爲：（一）董飛星（台）（二）張立人（台）（三）楊丕華（台）（四）赫斯（西靑）。</p>
<p>鏈球決賽　爲昨日田賽中晨後一個項目。此種玩意見，在我國正式提出公開比賽者，尙屬首次。我國健兒參加者，僅海軍與振武一人，其餘四人，盡屬碧眼兒。這中間除美在鄕軍人會密勒，對此道稍有造詣外，共餘大多外行，吳振武對此　却　有硏究。昨　　來頭頭是道，幾個轉身姿勢，尤爲美觀，博得四座黨聲不少，幾次威脅密勒，密勒恐遭吃　，使足狠動，結果把左臂也擲傷了。鏈球成績，因祗有密吳兩人够上水準，所以祗取了兩名。密勒的成績爲四三·四七公尺，吳振武則爲四二·六五公尺。</p>
<p>跳遠決賽　跳遠參加者中外選手共十人，中華隊代表三人，張立人以六·六四公尺獲冠軍，第二黄建，成績六·六二公尺，相差些微而已。第三李芬六·三五公尺，第四蘇聯諾伏高洛夫六·三一五公尺。其餘六人，俱未出六米之關。張立人直至第六跳，才得六米六四，黄建於第二跳即得六米六二，其後四次，皆不再進步。李芬成績，亦於第六次才跳得。昨日跳遠成績，平平而已，惟較之全運會之六米四七，略有進步。</p>
<p>三級跳遠　三級跳遠，中華隊亦有三人參加，結果包辦前三名，黄建以十四·一〇公尺冠軍，亞軍張立郞，第三張立人，西僑入選者僅一人，西靑史篤克列第四。黄建成績，較之全運會之十四·〇一，稍有進步。</p>
<h3>西僑實力太單薄　徑賽七戰竟六敗</h3>
<p>徑賽亦舉行七項，比賽過程略如下述：</p>
<p>一百公尺　徐天德與王松濤分獲第一·二·兩名，未見吃力。惟在二百公尺中，許通與徐天通遭遇勁敵，竟爲西靑A伊凡洛夫所挫敗，成績爲廿三秒正，是爲昨日西人隊參加各項徑賽中唯一之勝利。</p>
<p>四百公尺　因西僑無人參加，臨時取消。</p>
<p>八百公尺　中華隊由于希渭李令龍出席，勝來易易，于李兩人曾有激烈競爭，至七百公尺時李一度超出，但最後于希渭衝刺得力，卒以三公尺之差首着先　，西僑三選手則被拋落不下五十公尺。</p>
<p>一千五百公尺　西僑實力懸殊，仍成一面倒局勢，于希渭戰勝楊連陞，約有二十公尺。</p>
<p>一百十公尺高欄　黄兩正因小病初愈，雖獲第一成績未稱滿意，渠於跳第一·二·兩欄時，俱吿倒欄，致略形落後，迨越過三欄後，始漸復常態，徐寳臣棋差一着，獲得第二。西人拔藝不精，乏善可述。</p>
<p>二百公尺低欄　臨時復應西人之要求，加添此一項節目，容承彪張之靑加入客串，獲一·二·兩名，徐寳臣獲第四名，第三名則為美軍喬治所得。</p>
<p>四百公尺接力　僅中華，蘇僑，美童公學及西靑四隊加入，中華隊由台灣四選手代表，計第一棒徐天德，第二棒林秋江，第三棒陳新輝，第四棒許通，贏來亦極輕易。</p>
<p>一千六百公尺接力　僅中華與西靑兩隊，中華隊一路領先，相差有五十公尺之遙。中華隊代表第一棒爲陳文炎，第二棒趙學鴻，第三棒周之雄，第四棒彭開佐。</p>

<h3>綱球壇上傳佳話　葉觀雄楊渭濱賢伉儷　分踞王·后寶座　男女雙打錦標猶待今日揭曉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕男子網球單打冠軍，已於昨日產生，廣州葉觀雄及其夫人楊渭漬分別　得男女單打錦標。最初奪標呼聲最高之陶冠球，於昨日對　觀雄之決戰，慘遭敗績，退居亞軍，香港徐煒培第三，警察王文正第四。楊渭濱日前一戰，擊敗印尼陳金石，已奠定冠軍賽座之基石。此爪哇名手，被迫退列第二，上海朱芝英爲季軍，馬來陸元春壓後陣。</p>
<p>男女雙打錦標，亦將於今日上午決定，就前昨兩日戰况而言，男子雙打以香港徐氏昆仲希望最濃，女子雙打則已爲印尼之囊中物。</p>
<p>女子單打落選賽冠軍，爲貴州王　淑所得，此係不斷棄權之結果。女單打落選賽，實際舉行者僅兩塲，其餘各塲皆爲一方棄權，昨日落選決賽，福建周淑安亦吿棄權。</p>
<p>男子單打落選賽，今日上午九時舉行複賽，優勝者即於十時半舉行決賽。</p>
<p>至於男女雙打落選賽，因會期已滿，決定不再舉行。其餘各塲綱球比賽，均定於今日上午賽畢。</p>
<p>昨日男子單打決賽，葉觀雄對陶冠球之戰，昨日打來，特別沉着，上網　擊，屢次建功，終得擊敗冠球。王文正和徐煒培大戰四盤，平分秋色，但因體力不支，第五盤乃吿棄權。女子單打楊　濱擊敗朱芝英，並不費力，奪得冠軍。昨日結果列後：</p>

<p>王謹淑（黔）勝周淑安（閩）周棄權</p>
<p>棄陶大戰　二小時半　陶冠球棄觀雄之決賽　昨日大戰二小時半，才分高下。陶冠球之穩健抽擊，終被葉之猛烈高壓　殺所擊破。陶葉各得一盤後，第三盤成膠着狀態，葉觀雄忍得住氣，以八比六勝。第四盤，陶冠球已不能支持。總結三比一，失去寶座。</p>
<p>雙打決賽　陶王棄權　昨日下午雙打決賽，警察陶冠球王文正棄權，馬華謝羅華林喜振獲得二分，徐氏昆仲以直落三擊敗陳立超李文宣，昨日陳李表演，遠不及前日對陶王一塲精彩，失球極多，徐氏昆仲則合作純熱。</p>
<p>女子雙打　馬印得勝　女子雙打，上海原可勝馬來，但因求勝心切，不免慌張，竟以二對一失風。印尼陳金石張美珊合作較佳，廣州　巧見較爲軟弱，屢次失誤，楊　　獨木難支，不得不屈居下風。</p>

<h3>裁判徐紹武　傷勢將痊愈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月九日上海對大連足球比賽，大連隊以三對一負於上海後，遷怒裁判員徐紹武，加以毆打，事後由審判委員會嚴加懲處，詳情業誌本報。茲悉：徐君傷勢已將痊愈，惟大會方面將田法律顧問提起控訴，至徐君失落掛錶一只，已由大會津貼國幣一千萬元，聊以彌補其損失。</p>
<h3>足球奪標結束最後一幕　警港陸並列冠軍　昨賽結果警陸各二平局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲足球循環賽最後一日，因上海隊資格取消，香港隊輪空，戰局僅警察對陸軍一塲。最近因足球糾紛迭起，大會爲防止意外，特加强警衛，禁止一切閒人入塲，甚至各報採訪攝影記者雖有大會規定准予入塲者，亦皆摒之塲外。宣　吾·　叔平·郝更生等並高踞藤椅，親自坐鎭塲邊，全塲觀衆爲之側目。因游泳池體育館客滿而轉入田徑塲之觀衆，面對此塲內嚴肅而又緊張之空氣，均屛息靜觀，警陸兩隊　兒即在此特殊之環境下，完成　標　最後一幕決戰。昨兩隊上半時踢來鬆懈異常，下半時戰况較緊，陸軍隊戰術有長足之進步，而警察隊除前鋒之短傳外，別無多大表現，故終塲　以二對　　　。</p>
<p>在戰局展開之同時，陸電隊　港陸一役港隊犯規事，又補辦手　向大會重提抗議，經大會召集會議商討，結果認爲港隊隊員劉福全確屬二次人塲，裁判員未察，致　足球規則，本應重行比賽，因大會閉幕在即，無法舉行，故判定十三日下午四時香港對陸軍一塲爲和局各得一分。紛擾數日之足球糾紛，經大會兩次重要決定並公吿後，遂成下列局面：</p>
<p>陳金石張美珊（印）　二　〇　四</p>
<p>楊　濱羅巧兒（穗）　一　一　二</p>
<p>陸元春陳君玉（馬）　一　一　二</p>
<p>朱芝英阮麗（滬）　〇　二　〇</p>
<p>綜結此次足球循環賽結果，警察·香港·陸軍三隊得分相同，勝球數目亦復無異·故大會業決定並列冠軍，三隊同得　標。足球　標　環賽於此遂吿順利結束。</p>
<h3>裁判員辭職　組長親自出馬　比賽過程並不緊張</h3>
<p>昨日之賽·因裁判員辭職，無人担任，最後由裁判組組長江良規親自出馬，並由上海足球裁判會會長樂秀榮，南開大學體育主任伏洛句分任巡邊員，比賽得以順利進行。</p>
<p>比賽於下午四時四十五分起開始，　隊攻勢並未如想像中之緊張、陸軍前鋒進取較爲迅捷，警察似不及前兩日勇猛沉着，攻防均疲軟異常。致爲羅壽　張金海所乘，兩次挑傳、高秀淸趕上一頂，球出並不峻急，然竟吿入網，此後警隊中鋒趙富領導全師反擊，數分鐘內即帶球直　敵門，在左角反身拉射中的，此球因頗能表現技巧與功力，故博得不少彩聲，上半時紀錄各一。</p>
<p>下半時開球後，陸軍中堅孟義良首犯手球謝錦河主罰兩次未進，　虞片刻，孟中鋒又在禁區撞人判罰十二碼仍由謝錦河主　脚頭起處，球遂擦地而入。警隊紀錄增加，十氣較振，前鋒短傳尤見熟練，陸軍以吳祺祥傷脚未愈，改由姜聞淸塡補，因深恐後衛不堪應銳，故特別加强中衛　孟薛一綫、對警鋒百計遏阻，在警隊無法施展攻勢之情形下，張金海得球疾進，猛射一脚，爲余耀德騰空撲出，余尙在驚慌未定之際又爲金海補上，一蹴中的。二比二平分秋色以後，雙方俱仍思得機再起，因此金錄生謝錦河等屢有佳妙技術表現，惟以時間迅即終結，兩隊終吿和解。</p>
<p>警察隊：</p>
<p>金耀德　曾仲雲　鄭英權　莫錦松　游華興　劉廣才　　振輝　劉天申　　富　李炳照　謝錦河</p>

<h3>足球賽紛擾事件　鄂隊陳述三項意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕湖北選手隊爲該隊與南京舉行足球落選賽糾紛事件，特於昨午四時招待記者，由該總領隊湖北省政府敎育　科長余勁松及足球指導曾子忱，報吿事實經過，表示該隊並未毆打，並云此點可由在塲觀衆及新聞記者作證，認大會之裁判實欠公允。現湖北隊特發表三點意見如下：（一）爲維護湖北名譽起見，大會所稱，旣與　實不符，對其處罰亦決無法接受。（二）請求大會提出歐打之具體證據，則鄂方即可立刻認錯，亦責負把人交出來。（三）大會對本事件之處置絕對不公允，此次大會對湖北之處罰，反較毆打裁判員有據之單位爲嚴峻，殊屬奇事。現湖北方面，業已將上述意見，書面送呈大會，希望於最短期間，獲得合理解決。</p>
<h3>滬足球隊　亦提責詢</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕上海足球隊爲與警察一役棄權，被審判委會判處停止比賽後，亦於昨日向大會提出黃間，認爲網球賽中王文正·徐煒培·亦會棄權，惟下午仍出塲比賽，但未聞大會有何徵處，故要求調査，一律公平處理。據記者自有關方面探悉，大會今日即行閉幕，此兩項料紛，恐將不了了之。</p>
<h3>禁止記者入塲　各報提出抗議</h3>
<p>本市各報採訪及攝影記者爲昨日未能入場採訪攝取陸軍對警察足球賽新聞事，特向全運會提出抗議。抗議書內容如下：</p>
<p>「逕啓者昨日下午四時，在大會田徑塲舉行之陸軍對警察足球錦標循環賽，本報等新聞記者攝影記者均被禁止人塲採訪攝影，依照大會宣傳組規定之「全運新聞及攝影記者採訪辦法」第八條及第九條，新聞記者及攝影記者均可進人田徑競賽塲採訪及攝取新聞，　在人數上有如下之限制：A現時有體育版之報紙每家一人，B其他特殊情形者由審核委員會決定。是並未禁止記者一律不准入塲彰彰明甚。且當時塲內有若干非規定在塲內之人物，聲稱「我是常務委員」者，高踞藤沙發，頤指氣使，形成特殊階級，大會此種措施，顯屬違反其規定，茲特鄭重提出抗議，尙祈即日賜予答復爲荷」。</p>
<h3>解決球賽糾紛　審判委會決議　積分相等　名次並列</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全運　審判委負會，昨日下午七時，假游泳池二樓市體專校長室，舉行第五次委員會。主席王正廷，出席委員吳邦偉，宋君復，高梓，劉化鵾，錢旭滄。列席郝更生，邵汝幹，等共計十餘人。決議事項有二：</p>
<p>（一）十三日下午四時，香港對陸軍足球比賽，陸軍提出抗議，請討論案。決議：香港對陸軍足球比賽，香港隊隊員劉福銓二次入塲，裁判員當時未曾立刻査明，致運反足球規則，本應重行比賽，惟大會閉幕在即，無法舉行，應作和局論，各得一分。</p>
<p>（二）關於各項球類比賽積分相等者，應如何處理案。決議：一，女子排球，上海，湖南，合灣，得分相等，並列冠軍，第四名廣州。二，男子排球，警察，香港，廣州，得分相等，並列冠軍，第四名上海。三，女子籃球，冠軍上海，印華，福建，菲華，得分相等，並列亞軍。四，男子壘球，冠軍台灣，上海，廣州，警察，得分相等，並列亞軍。五，足球警察，香港，陸軍，得分相等，並列冠軍。</p>
<h3>浪花四濺　馬華水球·光芒萬丈</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　洪絮才</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕馬華水球隊，擁有十餘年的歷史，成立迄今，百戰百勝，所向無敵，在馬來亞擁有「常勝隊」的盛譽。</p>
<p>一九三六年，世界運動會在柏林召開時，日本得了游泳冠軍。世運閉幕後，日本選手從柏林回國時，道經星加坡，和馬華水球隊作了一次友誼賽，馬華竟以九比五勝日本。從此，日本對馬華水球隊，不得不另眼相看，而世人對於它的實力，也就不得不重新佔價了。</p>
<p>馬華水球隊，有着極洸榮的戰績：一九四〇年香港游泳隊遠征馬來亞，會有過水球比賽，馬華以十比零獲勝。未來上海以前，又和軍聯足球隊賽過，結果以九比二獲勝。這次爲出席全運員，又曾和該地聞名之檳城水球隊舉行比賽，以八比零勝檳城。</p>
<p>馬華水隊隊的隊員，每人都有十五年及二十年的歷史，對於打水球，那是絕對有把　的他們希望能够找　會出席七月在倫敦召開的世運　，一切準備手續，正由星加　世界運動會籌備會商洽中。</p>
<h3>何魯添回馬　第一件事吃官司</h3>
<p>水　隊員共七人，山何魯　擔　敎　　何氏說起馬華水球隊。　　　去，似不勝傲然的氣　．何教　　自星加坡起程來上海　　心意忙忙地　在街上撞死了一個人，車身翻了，他滿身都受了皮傷，這件事現在還未了，所以他說：「回馬來亞的第一椿事情是吃官司」。</p>
<h3>仰泳冠軍黃碧霞　水上奪鬥達十年</h3>

<h3>排球決賽臨去秋波　男女各出冷門　總結果　男：香港廣州警察　女：臺灣湖南上海　同列冠軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕男女排球循環決賽，昨晨出了兩塲冷門，一爲上海　子軍以零比二負於湖南，一爲香港男排隊亦以零比三負於警察，因此男女排循　賽結果，各有三隊均各得四分，（男排爲香港，廣州，警察；女排爲台灣，湖南，上海，）同列冠軍。另一塲男排奪標賽爲廣州戰上海，廣州勝，三比一。茲列男子排球奪標循環賽各隊得分表如下：</p>

<p>等！裁判爲何不來</p>
<p>滬湘女排球決賽，自於上次在市體育館不歡而散後，經大會裁判委會決定，於昨晨重新賽起。兩隊球員均於九時到塲，但等待良久，裁判未到，塲中人咸謂恐無人願作此一球賽之執法人，蓋上次體育館呼打之一幕，已給人極壞之印象；，然越半小時後，裁判許民輝終於姗姗而來，比賽遂即開始。</p>
<p>奇！上海　得費解</p>
<p>上海娘子排球隊，於此次循環賽中，連勝台灣·廣州、每塲表演均屬上乘，尤以擁有沙塲名將陳梅貞·黄明媛·王維珍·等，此次穩得冠軍，毫無異議上次在市體館，亦曾以二十一比四戰勝對湘比賽之第一局；不料昨日各名將均演出失常，陳梅貞等幾乎毫無貢獻，尤其在第二局尾聲，愈輸愈亂，完全陷入挨打態勢，敗得令人費解！</p>
<p>怪！前後判若兩人</p>
<p>在第一回合中，滬軍即出師不利，連續失分。湘方鄭培坤不斷以猛扣進擊，而上海之殺手陳稱貞，則旣不能鎖網，又未獲殺球好機會，即使殺去，亦平淡無奇，不足建功。黄明媛更是未見有新建樹，與往日比，前後判若兩人。於是相差最遠之分，竟爲十比廿，最後梅貞等雖扳回數球，但終以十四比廿一敗了。</p>
<p>唉！斷　整個江山</p>
<p>休息軍戰，滬方極想反攻，一度成四分平排，後來梅貞等又施其故技，專攻湘隊最弱之第三排，獲以七比四之數領前，旋復籍十五比十二佔得優勢。大家滿以爲上海已可挽回大局，豈知十五平手以後，上海小姐們即幾乎一蹶不振。湘隊發球，滬軍不能應接，未幾上海隊便以十六比甘一陷落了整個大好江山。</p>
<p>湖南　鄭培基　劉興珩　鄭培坤　秦本澤　曾育媛　劉蘊珊　陳純秀　廖志強　劉竹蘭</p>
<p>上海　朱錦雲　陳梅貞　王珊　陳榴珍　王維珍　黃明媛　項毓琳　陳揭書　陸兆珊</p>
<p>慘！香港敗　好苦</p>
<p>男排香港對警察之戰、港以原來陣容仰戰警察，以銷網之術爲警方所破，（按警方昨所採取之快殺速扣角度頗佳，頓使港方硏究有數之鎖網術失效），同時守多於攻，遂使警方「以全力爲攻勢」之策略克奏奇功，打得香港空前慘敗。</p>
<p>！總算收回失地</p>
<p>使人對香港寄有厚望者，蓋由於前在市體育館之港穗之役，那一天，港旅的確精練非凡。及至港滬之戰，香港即稍見退步，昨日尤其不及。昨日第一局中，開頭屢成平分，港方一度連絡頗好，三排供球助扣亦有成績。然在第四分以次，香港即已感受警察頭排左翼扣擊之威脅，甚至好手鍾士元亦失了球，幸有余啓恩還以猛扣，收回失地。曾在九分十分時，與警方並肩逐鹿，其後，港軍之扣球即反被對方彈了回來。如是，警察　戰而以廿一比十四獲第一局。</p>
<p>好！警察面上有光第二局，警隊先聲奪人，香港頭排左數度以手過網而失分，寃枉了許多好球，警察第一排左　之殺扣，專攻港旅弱點（三排右），得分不少，香港全隊幾平均失常態。連絡方面，供球遞球不行，余啓恩又被對方關然，因此香港入於苦守狀態，　知這守勢傳造成了類勢，所以，警察竞能獲得廿一比四之大勝。</p>
<p>惜！港隊　盤皆錯</p>
<p>最後一盤，警隊因已勝兩局，　本充裕，進攻愈見有勁，頭排以假動作　　擊頗見成效，香港雖沉着　戰，曾獲七分平手，而大勢仍無好轉。易地而戰時，港方以三排右趙仕澗失球大多，換以邵　榮，然仍無補於大局，自此以後，香港錯誤愈多，終於以十三比廿一又輸去第三局而致全軍覆沒，出乎衆料。</p>
<p>警察　譯瑞堅　任羨湛　黃永棟　倪沛霖　陳祥華　黃育民　　均樂　李如就　伍權均</p>
<p>香港　林潤明　陳昌永　歐陽兆棠　陳樹德　王耀民　余啓恩　趙仕潤　鐘士元　李　明</p>
<p>（第三局後半局李麗明易邵顯榮）</p>
<p>幸！人馬調得不壞</p>
<p>上海對廣州之男排賽，滬隊於最近循環賽中，雖然一般早料　獲殿軍，但迎戰三次，的確每次均見進步，此不能謂與陣容之調整　關。例如原陣容以詹琛打頭排右，表現得很不稱職，而換以汪均炳後，全隊實力大為改觀，蓋汪之猛扣，頗有獨到之功也。昨日汪均炳亦建樹頗多，同時，鄭亦泉與翁誠光昨再互調後，於攻擊方面，建功不少。黄　華打三排左也似乎比打三排中更見適宜。昨日上海獲勝第一局。實全賴汪，鄭，翁，　將之進攻，及黄　華，程世寗，等之供球。</p>
<p>弱！上海料到難贏</p>
<p>但論攻擊之力量，及實力之平均，以及作掩飾性之進擊，滬隊自然不及廣州。例如廣州前　中之黎連澤，後排中之陳榮寬，都較滬方之　家　與程世寗高明。昨日滬隊於贏得首局後，復失三局，亦意料中事。</p>
<p>數！此非戰之罪也</p>
<p>昨日第一局中，滬隊全取攻勢，得力於頭排中右兩將，及二排左右兩翼者不少；其後三局，滬隊仍照原有戰鬥力發展。惟廣州之三排左右翼扣得結棍，上海多不能　救。不過，上海隊亦已盡量發揮其戰鬥力，故後三局雖均喪失，而比數相差並不太遠。四局之比數爲：十四比廿一，廿一比十五，廿一比十七，廿一比十一。</p>

<h3>銀根緊·米價疲　民調會昨未拋售　麵粉初疲後昂雜糧油餅再跌</h3>
<p>米市跌風轉甚，價格已跌入拋米之內，故民調會昨未拋出。因產地無錫價格報降甚鉅，人心極虛，加以銀根緊勢益厲，本街去路殊呆，價乃直落，高貨米售樣亦多，北市塲白粳做五百四十五萬，南市塲白粳，薄稻各開五百四十萬元。高貨無秈連袋退入五百萬內，爲四百九十萬元，各較上日猛跌三四十萬元。昨日到貨二市共計四千一百六十三石。</p>

<h3>新買不動浮多爭吐　紗布繼續回跌</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因業內外銀根異常緊縮，又加　建公司數度懸牌，大量配售後，市上籌碼益充，同業中頭寸軋緊者，不絕陳賣，客路不動，新買亦少，市在供過於求下，四十二支監鳳細紗晨開即步低至三億元大關，近收時浮空稍有補進，終以三億零二百萬元收盤，比上日再跌二千五百萬元。二十一支雙馬紗亦慘跌至一億八千二百萬元，降二千六百萬元。其餘各支粗細紗較週四行情普挫一二成之譜。</p>

<h3>尊官論</h3>
<p>— 玄玄</p>
<p>際此民主時代，人民世紀，不作「賤官論」，而作「尊官論」，其人頭腦之落伍也可以知矣。但我的意思是官也是民，不過官是治民的專家，而這「治」却是人民委託他來治的，因此官是種一按術人才，中國最缺少的便是　術人了，豈可不尊官？</p>
<p>國人常把英文裏的＂Public　servant＂譯作「公僕」。實在大有問題。把獻身於人羣的技術人才當封建時代的家奴看待，豈是民主時代應有的現象？這個字理應譯作「服務　公衆的人」，這樣才可顯出官的眞正的性格來。</p>
<p>前天參加一個小小的筵席，席上大都是一些上海中等的所謂「民族工業家」，其中有一位却是剛從南京來的，說起這次競選，某人拿出二萬億，某人拿出八千億之類，於是「民族工業家」某甲便顧頭　腦地喟然嘆曰：「這都是民脂民　呀，還不是我們老百姓的錢嗎？一「民族工業家」某乙不絕地點頭稱善。我一看他們這副神氣，倒頗有點正義感似的。但繼而一想，他們自己又何嘗不是刮民脂民膏，要老百姓錢的？投機取巧的是誰？狂抬物價的又是誰？做官的要了老百姓的錢，叫「貪汚」，罪該萬死。做生意的搶了老百姓的錢，叫「著於經商」，不但不犯法，倒是老百姓的錢活該被他們榨去似的。今日之法律，　非厚商而薄官？想起封建時代官兒出來時的那一副排塲和今天官兒都得拍商人馬屁一比，實在做官只是抱有經世之術者的末路。爲何不經商，　要做官？</p>
<p>中國對於官吏待遇的苛刻也是首屈一指的，一個特任官的收人萬萬不及弄堂裏開一爿小烟紙店的。這還有什麽話可說？當貪汚變成一個人求生存的工具時，我們還能苛求什麼？「皇帝不差餓兵」，我們老百姓連普通的生活費用都不能給他們，我們還有面孔罵人貪汚嗎？不貪汚，難道叫人　着肚子替你出力？戎馬半生的陳誠將軍自承鶴俸所入，不敷所出，還得靠太太的粧　來補貼生活。如果這是事實實在是老百姓太混帳了。</p>
<p>以戰前的生活水準來說，一個市長每月韋兩千塊錢官俸決不爲過，約合今天的情形，那末每月至少該領十二億，但一位市長眞的拿了十二億的月俸，便會有人出來說閒話，以爲這來免太浪費國幣。如果是一個商人，每月賺上百億千億，一點也不稀奇。其實市長　十二億，是替市民工作的應有報酬，商人賺上百億千億，却無非是刮衆人頭上的錢。可是一般人的觀察，竞有如此不同，豈不奇哉怪也？</p>
<p>旣然今日之官，其不可爲者有如此，那末爲何還有這許多官在無棧，甚至鑽營呢？這便不能不怪我國「官才」之衆。任何貨色，一過剩，便跌價，「官才」自亦不能例外。與念及此，不禁爲官三嘆！亦爲此中國無出路的一羣知識者和技術人才淚落！</p>
<p>好在筆者生平不曾有過一官半職，說了這一番話自問不算文過飾　，而是眞正的同情他人也。</p>
<h3>談「打」</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>「打」在二十世紀，是個風行而又刺激的字眼，除了「打」過兩次世界大戰不算外，平時在世界各地——尤其我們中國，自古已然，於今爲烈！隨時聽得到「打」的聲音，處處看得見「打」的塲面，一言不合，便擦堂　拳，大打出手。在中外　目堂而　之的國大開會期間，有渦打的事件，而近日全國運動會中又時以「打」聞。夷考我國對於「打」字的濫用，不自今日，可謂古已有之的國粹也。</p>
<p>按歸田錄載：「今世俗言語之訛，而舉世君子小人皆同其謬者，惟「打」字爾。其義本謂考擊，故人相毆，以物相擊，皆謂之打。而工造金銀器亦謂之『打』可矣，蓋有　擊之義也。至於造舟軍者曰打船打車，網魚曰打魚，汲水曰打水，役夫餉飯曰打飯，兵士給衣糧曰打衣糧，從者執傘曰打傘，以糊黏紙曰打黏，以丈尺量地曰打量，舉手拭眼之昏曰打拭，至於名儒碩學語皆如此，觸事皆謂之打，而遍檢字書，了無此字（丁雅反者），其義主考擊之『打』，自音「謫耿」，以字學言之，打字從手從丁，丁有擊物之聲，故音『謫耿』爲是，不知因何轉入」丁雅』也。」</p>
<p>於此，我們獲知此一「打」字，「君子小人皆同其謬」。但「打」字雖於文理欠通，口頭說說，究無大礙。而人與八間眞材實料的幹起來，却朱免有點那個！無論如何應該檢討一番，改正一下才是。</p>
<h3>記余叔岩</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>去年杜壽的義務戲，南北名角中，最出風頭的，要算孟小冬了。第一天登台，花籃折現，其數目之巨打破了上海的紀錄。一　搜孤救孤，唱了三天，風魔了上海的整個戲迷。那時走到舞場，酒館，或是咖啡座，常常可以聽到「娘子不必太烈性」的戲詞。在今天，老生一角，能够如此吃香，真可以壓倒梅博士了。</p>
<p>孟小冬這齣戲，是從余叔岩學的，尙有捉放等戲，都是余大賢（叔岩的別名）親口傳授。可惜小冬拜師時，叔岩已不唱戲，不然的話，小冬要是能從台上將叔岩手足　眉動態，與聲音高下疾徐輕重自然神合之處，一一簡練而揣摩之，則以小冬的聰明，必可以爲叔岩之傳人矣。</p>
<p>李少春也是叔岩的弟子，自命不凡的，是一齣戰太平，我看過少春這戲，覺得離叔岩尙遠。在七七戰事發生之前　每年學校放暑假，我總到北平去住些時，叔岩的椿樹下二條住宅，是必到的地方，每隔三四天，常與二三友人於夜深時，往叔岩處　天，在十二點　前後，叔岩烟已吃飽，正是精神　　之時，雖然久已不露，每夜總要唱一二齣吊嗓，眞是呌人過足戲癮。聽完戲，約在一兩點鐘，吃解兒餅消夜，又是一種口福。彼時叔岩已有病在身，從其談話中，知道彼成名在問樵鬧府，打棍出箱一戲，其受病致命在戰太平一戲，茲略述之。</p>
<p>叔岩第一次唱問　　府，打棍出箱，余友張四爺（季馥）知之最詳，玆引其言如下：「民國初年，叔岩在糧食店中和園尙小雲的班中唱壓軸，一日小雲有天津堂會，爲期三天，叔岩想獨挑大樑，又躊躇不敢，余慫恿其唱問樵鬧府，打棍出箱。戲報貼出，是日余先到園中，見聽客寥寥，心中頗爲不安，問一老看座的，『你看今晚座兒怎樣？』看座的答：「拿不准。這年頭是花衫靑衣的世界，譯老板來都不成。」我聽此話，更爲難過，要是眞不呌座，豈不害了叔岩。　到叔岩家中，叔岩正在吊嗓，問我園子裏座兒怎樣？我答以很好，飯後我又到中和園，從旁邊一長弄進去，在弄中聽見園中　　之聲，進園見人頭擠擠，已賣滿座，心中大樂。不久見台上門　旁露叔岩臉，手中拿一京八寸，想必十分得意。是日叔岩嗓子特　，身段淡式已極，拴子（下長林）與配樵夫，錢金福與配煞神，兩人亦極賣力，　好之聲，不絕於耳。叔岩　　這齣　唱紅了，尙小雲從天津回來，大爲驚異，從此對叔岩另眼看待了。」以上是張四爺的話，足見一代藝人，成名也很不容易。</p>
<p>叔岩的拿手戯，除問樵　府，打棍出　外，要算戰太平了。叔岩最後一次唱此戯，裝扮齊全，正要上塲，忽覺要小便，此戯札靠，穿脫費時，叔岩恃强，不願誤塲，在　鼓緊張聲中，仍舊出來，以後一塲緊一塲，直至一點多　完戯，始得小解，已經漲得要命，從此受了傷。以後發病最利害時，須西醫施行手術。爲之放尿。七七後，余未能北游，故都友人來信言叔岩之病愈深，每次小便，必須在馬桶上坐許多分鐘，一滴一點的解出，痛苦異常，有時甚至要用一種管子。及日人發動太平洋戰爭，美國藥械斷貨，叔岩用完最後「隻管子，竟死於此病，眞眞可惜。</p>
<p>叔岩最後一次登　，是在民廿四年，前門外第一舞事有賑災義務戯，特煩叔岩演問樵鬧府，打棍出箱，恰巧我在故都，得觀其盛。余在池子中，見馬運良，譯小培寓英父子，者在看戲，大約是有所揣摩吧？叔岩以問樵鬧府，打棍出箱一戲成名，仍以此一戯爲其最後絕作，眞是再巧也沒有了。</p>
<h3>時間寶貴</h3>
<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>時閒即金錢，這是一個極普通的格言了。</p>
<p>在目前，我感到一日的價値大有不可思議之慨。</p>
<p>例如郵電車票水電吧，相差一日，便在金錢上有了相差倍蓰的分別，假定某人好容易籌劃了一筆錢，準備明天出門，豈知一覺醒來，市面大不相同，眞令人哭笑不得。</p>
<p>記得以往的公用事業業漲價，往往是討論再三，才加了一些價，後來乃成爲週期性的漲價，但照例是月初開始，因此人們再到一月過完，都不免有些提心吊阻，然而到底還有個準備的工夫。如今可不然了，往往今日議定，明日便漲，直使人有猝不及防的感覺。從此以後，要在每日終了之後就提心吊胆了。</p>
<p>希望時間的價値到一日」爲止，可不要弄到寸陰是寶的程度。萬一弄到這小時議定下小時便漲價的時候，恐怕多數人祗有準備去自殺了，</p>
<h3>金花記</h3>
<p>— 明齋</p>
<p>一九四七年，墨西哥總統阿勒門訪問美國，受到了朝野一致的熱烈歡迎，踪跡所至，歡呼隨之，眞是　極一時。杜魯門總統先在白宮大張筵席，歡宴這位貴賓；過了幾天，阿勒門總統就在墨西哥駐美大使館中選席，杜魯門也欣然命篤，充份表現了美墨兄弟之邦的交誼。</p>
<p>然而，就在這一次宴會中，却穿挿了一齣小小的悲喜劇！</p>
<p>這　悲喜劇的佈景，當然就是上文說起的墨西哥駐美大使館的大餐廳。那一天，餐廳中佈置得宣麗堂皇。到處都是香氣馥郁的鮮花，廳的中央安設了一隻馬蹄形的長桌，兩旁的座椅都漆成金色，應邀作陪的一百多位紳士淑女都盛裝蒞臨，但見一片珠光寶氣，令人羨慕不止。</p>
<p>宴席中途，杜魯門總統立起來向主人敬酒，並致了一　短短的演詞。昭規矩，大家都應當立起來乾杯……</p>
<p>悲喜劇在　時候發生了！</p>
<p>那此　　　致　　軟的夜禮服的太太小姐們利　着筆挺的大禮服的紳士們正想立起來的時候，忽然全餐　中充滿了一陣粗野的「嘶嘶」之聲！若干拘謹的男賓仍舊嚴守交際塲中的　儀　照樣彬彬有禮的立着乾杯，更是一小部份好奇心比較重的客人却不免偸偸地回過身去，　　自己的褲子；那些太太小姐們却早已發覺出事情不對，急得花容失色！</p>
<p>而墨西哥大使館裏的幾位參事却驚惶失措的呆看着國際上大名鼎鼎的美國參議員康納利。原來那位奠定「兩黨外交政策」的老參議員雖然也已起立如儀，却立得非常尷尬——他坐的那雙荷子竟已和他的「後方」緊緊地合而爲一，康納利竟和他的椅子一同站起來了！</p>
<p>幾秒鐘後，眞相即已大白。原來墨西哥大使館雇用的漆匠竟然特別道地，椅十上一次一次的「鍍金」，固然成績優異，可是時間匆促，大宴時雖非「油漆未乾」，却至多祗能說是「油漆剛乾」，正好大宴的那一夜天氣奇熱，外加　非常潮濕，這許多原因湊在一起，結果是每一張椅十都黏黏地像是剛剛　過一層膠水！</p>
<p>那天，不論是男是女，每一個人的「後方」都印上了一朵略似蝴　形的「金花」。　　兩位大總統的坐位上都有　　　子，總算是　免於難，使墨西哥大使館的侍從們在大驚失色之餘，總算　爲安一安心。</p>
<h3>北城篇</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>斯　余謝客天台古城角時所作，　面　塲，義士盡散，白杜鵑謝，逮人未歸，將欲　西幕之召，而小兒女又無可託付，天痛地　，人更何堪？畢生最難遣釋之境，無逾此際！故另有句云：「危牀那有翻身夢？雙手難開絕命關。」「枉然日月星霜換，死得其當願亦惶。　祗今事過如　，禁得回想！</p>
<p>栖選北門人，有官而無　，數口活流　，頗藉　　　，生涯寗躭此？徵尙裨規復！俯仰俄經年，　白齒紛落。新春兵氣揚，堂燈檄海角，尹勞吾何辭？鎭心更漬足。（與孟叔堅縣長山行六百里，向紹令鄭重爲兄，借得械餉，）山荆村媂耳，亦以王事屬，風　傳密命，焦土期重綠！搏沙方成型，松間已換局，萬思斂手宜，好惡嚴十目。荒荒北城　，麥黃人影獨，雖有兩兒女，一炊一上藝，稚女最堪　，事事代僕役，身短汲桶高，舉手纔及　，　煤常　面　飯多半生緊。幼兒亦不嬌，劈柴分勢作，有時貪嬉戲，終怨阿姊惡，兩小那知讓？難免啼又哭。對此不忍呵，自味苦中樂，嗟哉荒唐境，實是銷魂窟！揚鞕厲頹志，門外征車輪。</p>

<h3>Election Method for Legislative Yuan President Voted on; First Ballot Prints the Names of All Legislators; The Size of the Ballot Will Be the Largest in the World</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Legislative Yuan will hold the sixth preparatory meeting on the morning of the 17th for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Yuan. Wu Tiecheng submitted a report at the fifth preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 15th and solicited the opinions of the committee members. Some people in the meeting advocated that the mutual election should be postponed since the rules of procedure had not yet been established. Jiang Yiping said that the President and Vice President would be inaugurated on the 20th, and in order to promote the administrative work as soon as possible, the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan should be mutually elected as scheduled on the 17th, which was passed by the whole venue without objection. Whether the rules of procedure can be passed before the 17th will not affect the mutual election.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The method for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan was all passed at the fourth preparatory meeting on the 15th. The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan is currently rushing to print the ballots. It is reported that according to the mutual election method, the first ballot should list the names of all 773 legislators. The names of the legislators are printed in No. 4 lead type. The size of the ballot will be the largest of any ballot in the world. Its size is smaller than two opened newspaper sheets but larger than four opened newspaper sheets.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The method for voting and counting votes for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan was also smoothly passed at the fifth preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 15th, with only minor revisions in the text. The fifth meeting was held at 3:30 PM, attended by 174 members, with Wu Tiecheng as chairman. The voting and counting methods were discussed item by item. Only the "four" boxes in the third clause were changed to "eight." Kong Geng advocated changing Article 5, which stipulates that ballots should be received with the certificate of election, to receiving ballots with the certificate of attendance, but this was rejected. All other items were passed without objection, and the meeting was adjourned in only forty minutes. The supervisors for voting and counting were also nominated by each unit after the meeting.</p>
<h3>Discussion Situation of the Fourth Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The method for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan was passed by the fourth preparatory meeting on the morning of the 15th after four days of discussion. During the discussion on the morning of the 15th, the members put forward many revised opinions on the draft, but as a result of the vote, only two amendments were made to the original text. The fourth preparatory meeting was still chaired by Wu Tiecheng, who announced the discussion of the mutual election method. The majority of the members advocated passing the discussion and voting item by item, and there was no objection. Hu Shuhua, convener of the Drafting Committee, explained the main points of the amendment adding the re-election clause, and then began to discuss item by item. When discussing the title, Li Boshen, Chen Dacheng, Chen Guyuan, Zou Shuwen, Guo Tianyi, Zhang Ziyang and others put forward their opinions, some advocated changing the method to rules, and some advocated changing the mutual election method to the mutual election and re-election method, but after the vote, it was still passed according to the original title. During the discussion of the clauses, fierce debates unfolded on Articles 2, 4, 5, and 8. Article 2 stipulates that the election must be held with the attendance of more than one-fifth of the total number of legislators. Wu Shangying pointed out that there were no "more than" words in the Legislative Yuan Organization Law and should be deleted, and this amendment was passed. Zhang Huiwen advocated that more than one-half of those present should be present, and Zhao Xianyi advocated more than one-third, but their opinions were rejected. Articles 4 and 5 stipulate that the first ballot lists the names of all members, and the second ballot lists the top two names with the most votes in the first election. The first election must obtain more than half of the votes to be elected, and the second election will be elected by the person with the most votes. Articles 4 and 5 were discussed together. Yang Buping, Liu Xianyun, Miao Qiping, Huang Su Fang and others advocated that the second ballot should still list the names of all members to conform to the purpose of mutual election. Some people also believed that listing only two names in the second election was a disguised nomination. Xu Pan Yun said that printing 773 people on the ballot was not only indefinitely large, but also some units were left blank because they were not elected, which was inappropriate. He suggested writing the votes separately and attaching the list of all members outside the ballot. The technical difficulties of the frontier members will be solved separately, but these amendments were rejected and passed according to the original plan. Article 8 stipulates the re-election method, which was the most contentious. It was originally stipulated that the re-election could be carried out with the proposal of more than one-fifth of the total number of members and the approval of more than half of the members present. Some members believed that the number of proposers was too large. Qiu Changwei took the lead and said that in order to maintain a consistent spirit, only 30 people need to propose. Zhu Huiqing, Liu Shidu and others advocated detailed regulations on the circumstances under which re-election should be carried out. Wu Shipeng and Tian Yushi advocated that re-election should be at least six months after the election. Huang Zhezhen advocated that there should be no two re-elections in the same session. Opinions were divided and debated repeatedly. Finally, after the chairman summarized the opinions of the members, he voted one by one and only passed the proposal to modify the proposal of more than one-fifth to more than one-tenth. The rest were rejected. In addition to the above four articles, the remaining five articles were passed without objection. The mutual election method was thus fully passed, and the meeting adjourned at 12:50.</p>
<h3>Draft Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan Submitted to the Preparatory Meeting for Decision; The Work of the Drafting Committee Comes to an End After Fierce Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan's Rules of Procedure held its fourth meeting at 8:45 PM on the 15th. The convener Lei Yin chaired the meeting. First, Chen Guyuan, convener of the 13-member group, reported on the group's meeting at 3 PM, which lasted for three and a half hours, to study the results of the re-examination and revision of the various matters delivered by the Drafting Committee's three meetings, and then discussed them again accordingly. Regarding the three readings in Chapter 5 "Readings," since the bills passed by the second reading will never be rejected again unless there are too few members present at the third reading, the method of enabling members to attend the third reading as much as possible to participate in the vote is still used to remedy this, so an additional article was added: "The third reading shall be conducted on the day after the second reading or at a meeting, but the chairman may conduct it on the same day as the second reading after consulting the members present." The provisions on questioning in Chapter 10 "Listening to Reports and Questioning" were revised as "The submission of questions is limited to stating the gist of the questions, and the answers to the questions shall not exceed the scope of the questions. The aforementioned questions shall not be used as a topic for discussion." In Chapter 12 "Order," the clause "Members who leave the meeting first do not affect the calculation of the quorum" was amended by adding the words "meeting" before "quorum," and an article was added to Chapter 7 "Voting" to limit the submission of proposals for voting when it is discovered during the meeting that the number of members present is less than the quorum. Finally, during the discussion of Chapter 8 "Exercise of Consent Rights," the scene of repeated debates in the second and third meetings and the 13-member group was repeated again. As a result, the revised text proposed by the group and other deletions and revisions were not passed. It was decided not to hold another meeting for discussion and to submit the four different opinions to the preparatory meeting of the whole Yuan for decision. (1) The proposed amendment A is a composite of the opinions of all parties in the meeting held yesterday, consisting of four articles: (1) "When exercising the same right under Article 55 of the Constitution, it shall be reviewed by the Committee of the Whole Yuan and then submitted to the meeting of the Yuan for voting. The Committee of the Whole Yuan mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall elect one person from the members to be the chairman."; (2) "If the Committee of the Whole Yuan deems it necessary, it may request the President to notify the nominee to submit his opinions on administration and personnel."; (3) "When exercising the right of consent under Article 104 of the Constitution, the provisions of Article 52 shall apply." (Note: Article 52 is (1)(4) "The decision to exercise the right of consent shall be made by secret ballot."). (2) Proposed amendment B is proposed by Chen Haicheng and others to delete the three words "and personnel" at the end of (2) of amendment A. (3) Proposed amendment C is proposed by Chen Guyuan and others to delete the entire article (2) of amendment A. (4) Proposed amendment D is proposed by Chen Bosheng and others to delete all articles (1), (2), and (3) of amendment A and replace them with "When the President submits a candidate to the Yuan in accordance with the provisions of Articles 55 and 104 of the Constitution, the President of the Yuan shall directly submit it to the meeting of the Yuan for a vote." Article (4) of amendment A shall still be retained. The debate on the "Exercise of Consent Rights" has been debated fiercely for three days, but no result has been achieved. However, after Bao Huaguo and Du Guangxun explained the spirit of the Constitution, no one now believes in the "Yuan Xian" theory that they should first learn about the administrative and personnel opinions of the candidate for President of the Executive Yuan when exercising the right of consent before submitting it. This issue will inevitably cause more intense disputes when it is submitted to the preparatory meeting. As for Ye Suochong's repeated proposal to include the two parts of the organization of the Committee for the Review of Member Qualifications and the election method of the President and Vice President of the Yuan in the rules, it is generally believed that it is not necessary to include them in the rules as they can be stipulated separately. The meeting ended at 10:45 PM. The work of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee came to an end after four days of earnest discussion.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Attends the Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Sun Ke attended the preparatory meeting of the Legislative Yuan for the first time on the morning of the 15th and sat in seat number 987 after the member seats, reading the Worldgram magazine and English newspapers he brought with him. He did not seem to pay much attention to the discussion of the method for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Yuan, and continued reading without interruption. Sun stepped out of the venue slowly when the meeting paused at 11:30.</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Ministry Suddenly Approves Transit Visas for US Consulate Staff to Dalian; Plan to Charter a Merchant Ship to Sail to Dalian Temporarily Canceled</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, This City] The US State Department originally intended to charter a merchant ship to sail directly to Dalian once to transport the US Consulate staff and supplies to Dalian. However, this morning, hours before the ship was scheduled to depart, it suddenly received formal notification from the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow approving visas for all US Consulate staff to pass through Vladivostok and then travel from Vladivostok to their destination. As a result, the plan to charter a merchant ship to sail directly to Dalian has been canceled. Consul Brock and Vice Consul Creston have been waiting in Shanghai for Soviet approval of their visas and transportation to go to Vladivostok and then to Dalian for months. After a long period of delay and still failing to obtain the necessary Soviet visas and travel rights, the State Department approved chartering a ship to sail to Dalian to transport US Consulate staff and sufficient supplies needed by the local consulate and to carry Vice Consul Barker and his family back. For this reason, special permission was obtained from the Chinese government to allow the Everett Lines' Coastal Winner to sail to Dalian once. The ship, which originally operated regularly between Korea and Shanghai, was scheduled to sail to Dalian yesterday, and was originally scheduled to depart today.</p>

<h3>The Problem of National Education Funding</h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>When the highest education authority attended the National Assembly on April 14th to report on the education situation, it declared that the Ministry of Education intends to fully promote national education in the future. Therefore, 800 billion was included in the central education budget for basic education subsidies this year. At the same time, the Executive Yuan passed the measures for consolidating and increasing national education funds, such as including national school expenses in the special budgets below the county level, holding "study grain" donations, launching temporary donations, and consolidating school funds and school properties. This shows that the government has decided to broaden national education funding to promote the basic education needed by the masses. "Our country's new education has always been an education that goes against the interests of the masses. It is an education that makes people pay money and give their children to become officials, and the children of the rich, after graduation, go back to exploit the poor and the children of the poor." In the past ten years, this anti-democratic situation has become doubly serious. The higher and secondary education exclusively enjoyed by a small number of children of the rich has shown unprecedented expansion, but the national education needed by the vast majority of taxpayers' children has shrunk to a pitiful level. From the perspective of social justice, this is extremely unfair. Therefore, the government's policy of popularizing compulsory education and broadening national education funding is worthy of support. However, the failures of the past few compulsory education popularization movements have been due to having plans without funds or having funds without proper management. Having plans without funds means the plans are just empty words; having funds without proper management means the funds are mostly embezzled by unscrupulous officials. Therefore, how to increase financial resources and how to properly manage them are two important issues in national education funding.</p>
<p>In the past, the methods for broadening national education funding have been piecemeal. In the future, unified and effective strategies for increasing financial resources should be adopted. First, we hope that the government will implement Article 164 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "the expenditure on education, science, and culture shall not be less than 15% of the total budget at the central level, not less than 25% at the provincial level, and not less than 35% at the county and city level." As long as this article can be implemented, the total education budget at the central and local levels will increase significantly, and national education funding will also increase accordingly. Second, we hope that the government will stipulate the proportion of national education funding in the central and local education budgets. According to the 1934 US education funding statistics, out of every 17 cents of education funding, 12 cents are used for primary school education, 3 cents are used for secondary school education, and 2 cents are used for university education. In other words, national education funding accounts for 70% of the total education budget in the United States, which is a quite reasonable ratio. Based on this standard, our country can tentatively make the following provisions: the central government's subsidies to various provinces shall not be less than 30% of their total education budget, the provinces' subsidies to various counties shall not be less than 40% of their total education budget, the counties' and cities' subsidies to various townships shall not be less than 50% of their total education budget, and the townships' subsidies shall not be less than 90% of their total education budget. Third, we hope that the government will follow the French method of paying teachers' salaries and stipulate the proportion of primary school teachers' salaries to be borne by governments at all levels. The salary of each primary school teacher can be subsidized by one-tenth by the central government, two-tenths by the province, three-tenths by the county, and four-tenths by the townships, all adjusted at any time according to the price index. Finally, the methods prescribed by the Executive Yuan, such as holding "study grain" donations, launching voluntary donations, and consolidating school properties, can also be adopted, but the most fundamental method is to hold education tax, which is stipulated by the Education Council and collected independently.</p>
<p>Now that the source of national education funding is abundant, the next question is how to manage it. The purpose of management, in a negative sense, is to prevent corruption and embezzlement; in a positive sense, it is to guide proper use. In the past, almost all the national education subsidies from the central government and various provinces were embezzled by unscrupulous officials. Provincial education administrators often diverted most of these subsidies to other purposes, such as compiling and printing textbooks, opening bookstores, purchasing machines, and experimenting with new teaching methods, or even using them to engage in commerce. There are many other ways to seek profit, too numerous to mention. However, the biggest drawback is the inflated number of national schools, because provinces and counties can use this to receive more national education subsidies from the higher-level government. For example, a certain province in Southeast China reported having more than 20,000 "Bao Xue" ten years ago, but according to experts' estimates, the actual number of "Bao Xue" currently is less than three-tenths of the reported number. A few years ago, when the author inspected the administration of a certain county in that province, the county government submitted a thick booklet of national school forms. The "Model Township" table contained the names, addresses, school land area, names, qualifications, and salaries of the principals and teachers of fifteen national schools, the number of male and female students in the children's classes, the number of male and female students in the adult classes, and the amount of various expenses, etc., everything was available. However, the actual investigation revealed that the "Model Township" only had one national school. The names of the other fourteen schools, the names of the principals and teachers, the number of students, and the various expenses were all fabricated, but the expenses that these schools should have received each month had been claimed without error by the county government using many fake seals. The author, with limited experience, reported the truth at a meeting and requested that the county magistrate be given a reprimand, but everyone believed that the situation was the same in all counties, and it seemed unfair to only punish the county magistrate, so the author suddenly realized and remained silent. In fact, all crows in China are black, and a certain province is no exception. In the past ten years, after the central government and provincial national education subsidies were exploited layer by layer, the amount that could flow into the hands of national school teachers was very little. As for the national education funding of townships and "Bao", it was mostly controlled by local tyrants, and their tricks were no less than those of the county magistrates.</p>
<p>The effective way to prevent embezzlement and guide proper use is of course the democratization of education administration. From the perspective of education economics, the so-called democratization of education administration is to allow the people to participate in the collection, management, and distribution of education funds, so that the money spent by the masses can produce the greatest efficiency in running education that seeks the happiness of the masses. In order to realize this ideal, the Chinese Education Society has suggested that the government establish education councils at all levels, organized by a certain number of leaders from all walks of life and education experts elected by the people. Their powers related to education funding are to determine education policies, review education budgets, stipulate education tax rates, collect education taxes, manage special education funds, review final accounts, accept complaints, impeach or dismiss education officials, etc. The establishment of provincial and county education councils can prevent the embezzlement and waste of national education funding, because the national education subsidies and other special funds from all levels of government are received, managed, and distributed to various units by the council. Money does not pass through the hands of education administrators, so they seem unable to commit fraud. Even if there is fraud, the council can discover the loopholes when reviewing the final accounts, and the people can also file complaints with the council, and unscrupulous officials will be punished. The establishment of education councils can not only prevent embezzlement but also indicate proper uses. Because it has determined the uses of national education funding when deciding education policies and reviewing education budgets. If it is difficult to establish education councils temporarily, an education funding management committee can be set up in the provincial and county councils, organized by a certain number of council members, social dignitaries, and education experts elected by the council. National education subsidies can be managed and distributed by the committee, and its income and expenditure can be announced at any time. Education committees can also be established in each "Bao", organized by a certain number of people elected by the people to manage the property and funding of national schools and publish their accounts monthly. Therefore, the democratization of education administration is the most effective way to manage national education funding. Only by increasing financial resources and managing them properly can the problem of national education funding be solved, and the plan to popularize national education can be realized.</p>
<h3>The US Continues to Purchase Siamese and Burmese Rice and Wheat for Shipment to China to Help Stabilize Our Grain Prices; Rationing of Grain in Cities Such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou Has Been Effective</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 15th] According to the Ministry of Food: Regarding the US purchase of rice in Siam to provide relief to our country, according to the report of Liang Changpei, the representative of the Ministry stationed in Siam, as of March 25, the US had purchased a total of 27,800 tons of rice with a relief fund of US$5 million. It has now been shipped to be used for grain rationing in cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In addition, the new aid-to-China bill includes a grain purchase fund of 85 million US dollars, but it is still in the discussion stage. The first phase of the US loan can be paid immediately, of which 16 million US dollars will be used for grain purchase, and 11.4 million US dollars will be designated for purchasing rice in Siam and Burma. According to the current market price, it is estimated that about 63,000 tons of Burmese rice can be purchased, and the remaining 4.6 million US dollars can purchase about 30,000 tons of foreign wheat. As for grain prices in various places, since the implementation of civil food rationing in cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai, they have gradually become stable. Recently, due to the sharp rise in general prices and the season of famine, grain prices have inevitably risen, but the rate of increase is still more moderate than general prices.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Replies to the Taiwan National Assembly Delegates Friendship Association; Talk of Replacing the Governor of Taiwan Province is Groundless; The Central Government's Reliance on Chairman Wei is Deep</h3>
<p>[Report from our Taipei office, 15th] The Taiwan National Assembly Delegates Friendship Association, due to repeated rumors from the outside world that the governor of Taiwan Province would be replaced, sent a letter to the Executive Yuan suggesting that local leaders should not be easily replaced. Now, a reply has been received from Zhang Qun, stating that the Central Government's reliance on Chairman Wei is deep, and the rumors are all false.</p>
<p>[Report from our Taipei office, 15th] The Taiwan National Assembly Delegates Friendship Association held a press conference today, reporting on their impressions of attending the National Assembly and the content of their proposals. Lin Zhong explained the content of the proposal to allow Taiwan Province to implement local autonomy in accordance with the Constitution first, saying that the proposal is attached with six measures: (1) Please ask the Legislative Yuan to formulate general rules for provincial and county autonomy before the end of June; (2) The central government designates Taiwan as a national autonomous demonstration zone; (3) Within two months after the promulgation of the general rules, convene a provincial people's congress to formulate provincial autonomy laws; (4) Within two months after the promulgation of the provincial autonomy laws, hold popular elections for county and city mayors; (5) After the popular election of more than half of the county and city mayors, hold a popular election for the provincial governor; (6) All mainlanders who have obtained citizenship and have a good reputation can be candidates for provincial and county mayors. Lin criticized the outside world for misinterpreting the autonomy demanded by Taiwan Province, saying: "Looking at the attached measures, one can understand that the autonomy eagerly hoped for by the Taiwanese compatriots is based on the Constitution." Subsequently, Yang Jinhu, Chen Fan, and others expressed their impressions, deeply admiring the magnificent buildings and commercial prosperity of the mainland, and praised the democratic style of the National Assembly, but also expressed surprise at the disparity between the rich and the poor in society. It is also learned that the Taiwan National Assembly delegates also proposed that the government recover the Ryukyu Islands and incorporate them into Taiwan Province.</p>

<h3>President Truman Announces Recognition of the New State of Israel; Still Willing to Strive for an Arab-Jewish Truce</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcasting, 15th: Washington News, White House sources said that President Truman is considering, if necessary, lifting the arms embargo on Palestine and considering negotiating the establishment of diplomatic relations with the provisional government of the State of Israel. White House Press Secretary Ross told a press conference that the government's recognition of the Israeli provisional government has been met with very positive reactions from all parties.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] President Truman formally announced today that the United States recognizes the Jewish State of Palestine de facto.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 14th] President Truman announced on the 14th that the United States recognizes the new Jewish state of Palestine. Minutes after the Jewish state in Palestine declared its establishment, which came into effect at 6:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time on the 14th, Truman issued a statement saying: "The U.S. government has been notified that a Jewish state has been proclaimed in Palestine and that the provisional government has requested recognition. The United States recognizes this provisional government as the de facto government of the new state of Israel." The US recognition comes at the time of the formal end of the British Mandate in Palestine. White House Press Secretary Ross said that the birth of the new Jewish state and the US recognition of it do not diminish US efforts to achieve an Arab-Jewish truce. "The United States' desire to facilitate a truce in Palestine is in no way diminished by the proclamation of a Jewish state. We hope that the new Jewish state will join the Armistice Commission of the Security Council in redoubling its efforts to bring an end to the war. The termination of the war is the main purpose of the United States throughout the entire stage of the United Nations' discussion of the Palestine issue." Truman's decision had been kept secret for two days. Lower-ranking personnel within the State Department were surprised by the statement. The general reaction was that the US had taken swift action ahead of the Soviet Union. Officials here had believed that the Soviet Union might be the first to recognize the "fact" when the British Mandate ended and the Jews declared a new independent state.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 14th] The White House's announcement of recognition of Israel has brought to a head a problem that has vexed President Truman since taking office. In recent months, this has been the cause of Truman's trouble with domestic and foreign policy in an election year. Today's recognition of the Jewish state is in effect recognition of the partition plan as a fait accompli. Truman's move clearly surprised many members of Congress.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 15th] Relevant parties believe that the US government's recognition of the Jewish state of Israel is motivated by domestic political reasons. President Truman's move is intended to make up for the damage done to the Democratic Party's chances of winning this autumn's election after the Truman administration abandoned its support for the Palestine partition plan. New York State has millions of Jewish voters, and the recognition of Israel is intended to win the favor of these Jewish voters.</p>
<h3>Britain's Inconsistent Policy on the Holy Land Greatly Alarms the United Nations; Britain and France Do Not Intend to Recognize Israel at Present</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Lake Success, 14th] The United Nations was in an uproar on the 14th, with rumors circulating that the US Chief Representative Austin intends to resign due to the White House's inconsistent policy on the Palestine issue. The surprising move by the United States has shocked both those who support and those who oppose the Jewish state.</p>
<p>When the news of the White House's recognition of the Jewish state reached him, Austin and the US representatives were also surprised. A spokesman admitted that the delegation had no prior knowledge of it. Diplomats from countries traditionally friendly to the United States, like the Soviet bloc, mocked the US delegation's ignorance. Some senior diplomats believe that Austin will react strongly and submit his resignation in protest.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 14th] President Truman's sudden announcement of recognition of the Jewish state of Palestine has thrown the United Nations General Assembly into chaos. The meeting has effectively stalled. Many representatives rushed out of the hall upon hearing the news, initially saying that such a development was unbelievable. The Arab representatives were thunderstruck upon hearing the news and then looked worried.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Flushing, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly unexpectedly rejected on the 14th the US plan to establish a special United Nations administration in Palestine. The Arab and Soviet sides cast a total of 15 votes against the plan, and 18 abstained.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 14th] The Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly adjourned today. The session, which opened on April 16th to discuss the Palestine issue, adjourned after four weeks without any results.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 14th] The British Foreign Office did not immediately comment on President Truman's sudden announcement of recognition of Israel, but a qualified government spokesman said that Britain would generally have to wait until the new state was able to govern before it could formally grant recognition. Moreover, Truman only announced de facto recognition, which is still far from de jure recognition. Only after de jure recognition can ambassadors be mutually appointed.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 14th] A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that France does not intend to recognize the Jewish state until the French government is certain that the Jewish state has good intentions and has not crossed the borders designated by the United Nations Committee.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Lake Success, 14th] Guatemalan representative Granados announced that Guatemala formally recognizes the new Jewish state of Israel.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Stockholm, 14th] Political circles here hinted on the 14th that Sweden may follow the United States in recognizing Israel. President Truman's recognition of Israel has surprised the Swedish Foreign Ministry.</p>

<p>Egypt was the first to launch the offensive of the Arab countries, attempting to land 21 miles south of Tel Aviv, while also trying to break into Palestine at two points in the south. A few hours after midnight, large Syrian and Lebanese armies, traveling in 150 armored trucks, crossed the border from the north to fight. The King of Transjordan sent his foreign troops and regular Iraqi troops directly from the east to Palestine. Jewish troops are fighting for a foothold in the Holy Land on all sides, acting quickly and occupying the city of Acre in one fell swoop. They took over Jaffa, Haifa, and captured most of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tel Aviv, 15th] The Haganah headquarters has just officially announced that at least one of the enemy Spitfire aircraft that attacked Tel Aviv this morning has been shot down by Haganah forces, and one Egyptian pilot inside the aircraft has been captured.</p>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem, 15th] At the same time, the Haganah headquarters announced that Jewish troops have launched a large-scale offensive along the Palestinian coast north of Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>[United Press Tel Aviv, 15th] After the Egyptian army invaded Palestine this morning, they used artillery to destroy the Jewish settlement of Sirtun Valley, while another army advanced towards Gaza. Jewish troops have been rushing to the borders to block the enemy's advance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Amman, 14th] According to authoritative sources in the capital of Transjordan on the 14th, the entire Arab Legion has in fact crossed into Palestinian territory in preparation for battle.

<h3>US Labor Party Member Suggests a Three-Power Meeting to Break the Deadlock on the Control of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 14th] Labor Party member Black proposed in the House of Commons that Truman, Stalin, and Attlee hold a summit meeting to break the deadlock on the control of atomic energy. Marshall, Churchill, and Vandenberg should also attend the meeting. Black believes that Stalin has been surrounded and cannot obtain accurate information on the views held by the people of the United States and Britain. Therefore, the leaders of Britain and the United States should talk to Stalin face-to-face.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Mayhew replied that if there is hope for progress, Britain will not want to lose it, but if there is no hope for agreement, negotiations would not only be useless but also harmful. Regarding the issue of atomic energy control, an agreement cannot be reached without sacrificing part of sovereignty. Since the Soviet Union is firmly unwilling to take this major step, no control system can succeed.</p>

<h3>More Hidden Communists Arrested; Most are Jiaotong University Graduates; Tao Long and Four Others Have Confessed; Mayor Reports on the Process During a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu held a press conference at the City Hall yesterday at 5 PM to report on the arrest of communists in the city, stating that in the past two months, 35 communists have surrendered to the security authorities. Most of them have lost confidence in the Communist Party, feel that there is no future, and their mentality has wavered, so they have surrendered one after another. The government's handling methods for communists hiding in the city are: (1) Encourage surrender and guarantee their path to reform. (2) If they remain unrepentant, they will be arrested and transferred to the Special Criminal Court in accordance with the Emergency Regulations for Harming the Republic of China During the Period of Suppressing the Rebellion. In the past few days, the security authorities have acted on this principle and arrested a hidden communist, Zhang Liangcai (female, 24 years old, from Wuxing, Jiaotong University graduate, currently a physics and chemistry teacher at Qiming Girls' High School). Based on her confession, five more people were subsequently arrested. Their names are Tao Long (male, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, Jiaotong University graduate, currently an intern engineer at China Agricultural Machinery Company), Tao Yao (male, 25 years old, from Wuxi, Jiaotong University graduate, intern engineer at China Agricultural Machinery Company), Liu Jiming (male, 26 years old, Jiaotong University graduate, intern at China Agricultural Machinery Company), Chen Yu (female, Jiaotong University graduate), and Cai Ying (female, not a Jiaotong University graduate). Mayor Wu stated that these people have all left school and are not current students. They were not arrested on campus, and there is solid evidence against them. Except for Chen Yu, who is still being interrogated, the others have confessed.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Students Send Representatives to Inquire; Mayor Shows Confessions and Self-Incrimination Statements</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University students sent Professors Qiu Weiyu and Huang Shupei and alumnus representative Li Kaidi to the City Hall today (15th) to inquire about the situation. They were told that this matter was unrelated to the students, and the government originally had no need to explain to the students and school authorities. However, to show the government's open attitude, the confessions and self-incrimination statements of Zhang Liangcai and others were shown to the three representatives. After reading them, the three representatives returned to inform the students that this matter had nothing to do with the current Jiaotong University students.</p>
<h3>Abstract of Confessions</h3>
<p>The following are excerpts from the confessions of Zhang Liangcai, Tao Long, Tao Yao, Liu Jiming, and others: Tao Long confessed that he had been working in the company since November and December of the thirty-sixth year (of the Republic). Tao Yao asked me if I was willing to join the Communist Party. This was because we were both class representatives in school and often met during meetings. Our opinions were very unified. After graduation, we both took jobs at the company. He introduced me to a book called "A New Outlook on Life." After reading it, I shared my thoughts, and he asked me about my views on the Communist Party. He was very satisfied with my answers. He then further discussed my family situation with me and asked if I was willing to join the Party. I said I was. He asked me to write</p>
<p>a report, including my family situation, personal experiences, etc. It was about three months before I officially joined. After the oath, I officially joined the Party and attended meetings. There were three people in our branch: Tao Yao, Liu Jiming, and me. We often discussed Communist theories. Tao Yao sometimes brought red books for me to read or told us to buy books after he had read them. We met about once every one or two weeks, mostly at Liu Jiming's house, in his own room.</p>
<p>Tao Yao confessed that a few days later, someone found me. His surname was Zhang. He told me to wait for him in a few days with a red book at the entrance of the Huishan Theater in Tilanqiao. That day, someone came on a bicycle. He came to my house to talk and asked me about my family and school situation, which I told him. Later, he came again for another chat. Two weeks later, the person who came was changed to someone</p>
<p>surnamed Lin, named Lin Ying. From then on, he was the one who came to see me. He said: We are participating in the technical department and asked me to unite the graduated classmates. So I found Liu Jiming and Tao Long (after a dinner at the Central Bank Club), and they agreed.</p>
<p>Excerpt from Zhang Liangcai's confession: Finally, he said there was a very political group that regularly plans and reviews work, helps each other, and studies together. He asked if I was willing to join. I said I was. He then said that this group was the Chinese Communist Party. I wasn't that surprised because someone had asked me to join before. Then he asked me to write a self-introduction report. The report took several weeks to write and was completed in mid-November. On November 29th, Tao came and said that my joining had been approved by higher authorities. He took out a piece of paper with the following written on it: (1) Revolutionary interests are above all else; (2) I am willing to fight for the cause of communism for life; (3) Resolutely implement resolutions; (4) Strictly abide by Party discipline; (5) Be a lifelong model for the masses.</p>
<p>It was only when the night school was about to end that I connected with the Party's Education Department. Before this, I really wanted to go to the Liberated Areas because (1) it seemed like Qiming's work had no future, but Tao said that this was my central work; (2) I felt unsuitable for the activities of Dongqing; (3) I was interested in the night school for female workers, but Tao said that this was not the central work, but a side activity.</p>
<p>M contacted me several times and talked about</p>
<p>Two instructions: one was about the current situation, the "Anti-Liu Hangchen Peace Grand Alliance," and the other was about the student movement, reviewing the past student movement, and instructing on future principles (mainly to resolutely launch mass movements on issues of livelihood and national identity, break the illusions of the masses towards the Kuomintang, and combine the suffering of the masses with American aggression and the rule of the Kuomintang). One time was to introduce myself, and another time was to introduce Qiming. Regarding my work, M said to focus on the student work of the Education Department, then talked about Qiming's work and the night school. One time was to talk about an instruction (mainly: 1948 is the year of riots, such as the Shen Jiu incident at the beginning of the year, the Tongji student unrest, and the spontaneous dance craze. May is a surge, not a climax. Crossing the river is not the arrival of victory. To cooperate with the May surge, we must step up the organization of the masses and prepare a reserve army for victory among the backward masses, etc.).</p>
<p>Excerpt from Liu Jiming's confession: Because of my close personal relationship with Tao Yao,</p>
<p>I believed what he said. At the beginning of December last year, he talked to me about joining the Communist Party. I agreed to join the Party. He asked me to write a report stating my family situation, personal experiences, etc. I also agreed, but because I was sick, it took a long time to write. After giving it to him, he said that it had been approved for participation by higher authority. Then Tao and Long took me to</p>
<p>[missing character]'s house for an oath.</p>

In the men's 100m backstroke, Malayan Chinese Feng Chao-yu broke the Games record with a time of 1 minute 16.9 seconds.

After the formal program was completed, due to the early hour, a men's and women's 150m medley relay exhibition was added to satisfy the audience. The details of yesterday's events are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's 1500m Freestyle Final</p>
<p>There were eight competitors. Zhuang Meidao of the Philippines entered the water fastest, followed closely by Chen Zhennan and Liu Dibing of Hong Kong. At 350 meters, Chen Zhennan stood out and reached the finish line first. Liu Dibing also chased Zhuang Meidao by about ten meters and finished second. Zhong Yaobo of Malayan Chinese suffered a cramp in his foot after 100 meters and was rescued ashore by the medical team, failing to complete the entire course.</p>
<p>Men's 200m Relay Final The Air Force withdrew, leaving only seven teams participating: Malayan Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Navy, Philippines, Shanghai, and Shanghai. Shanghai was selected. After the start, Hua Jingren of Malayan Chinese took the lead, followed closely by Cai Liheng of Hong Kong. From the third leg onwards, the Navy gradually fell behind. In the fourth leg, Feng Chao-yu, the "flying leg" of Malayan Chinese, went straight ahead, as fast as a submarine, reaching the finish line about 30 meters ahead of the others, setting a time of 1 minute 57.1 seconds, breaking the national record.</p>
<p>Women's 150m Medley Relay Only Hong Kong and Taiwan teams performed, with the first leg being backstroke, the second leg being breaststroke, and the third leg being freestyle. Hong Kong won.</p>
<p>Women's 100m Backstroke Final Luo Dezhen of Hong Kong and Yan Xiuyu of Taiwan withdrew. The remaining six all had the ability to score points, and the only question was the order of finish. Huang Bixia of Malayan Chinese led from start to finish. Zhang Yuntai of Taiwan was unwilling to fall behind. Zeng Fengzhen of Hong Kong and Zheng Yanying of Guangzhou competed fiercely. In the end, the little sister Zheng Yanying took a breath and, encouraged by the applause of the audience, won third place by the margin of an arm.</p>
<p>Men's 100m Backstroke Final Feng Chao-yu of Malayan Chinese was unmatched, breaking the Games record with a time of 1 minute 16.9 seconds. The results of the semi-finals the day before were even better.</p>

<h3>Water Polo Competition Malayan Chinese Has Amazing Stamina Hong Kong's Defense is Weak</h3>
<p>Water Polo Exhibition Match The match was between Malayan Chinese and Hong Kong. The players of Malayan Chinese had amazing stamina, and their offense and defense were seamless. In contrast, Hong Kong's coordination was scattered and their defense was weak. The ball was often in the hands of Malayan Chinese. As a result, Malayan Chinese won a big victory with a score of 14-5.</p>

<h3>International Track and Field Match Chinese Athletes Achieve Great Victory Qi Peilin Throws Discus to a New Level Breaking the National Record with 42.15 Meters</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] To add icing to the cake of the National Games, the International Track and Field Friendship Match was held yesterday at the Games' track and field stadium, with the winning athletes from this National Games competing against Western expatriate athletes from the city. There were a total of fifteen events. Except for the 200-meter and hammer throw, which were won by Western expatriate representatives, the Chinese team representatives showed their skills and achieved a complete victory in all other events.</p>
<p>Athletes Qi Peilin (misregistered as "霖" when registering for the National Games) and Dong Feixing both created one new national record and two new Games records. Qi Peilin broke his own national record of 41.55 meters set in this National Games with a discus throw of 42.15 meters; he also broke his own Games record of 12.72 meters set this time with a shot put of 12.91 meters. High jumper Dong Feixing also broke the Games high jump record with an excellent result of 1.82 meters, all of which are valuable achievements.</p>
<p>In yesterday's events, the 400-meter was temporarily canceled due to insufficient Western expatriate participants, and a 200-meter low hurdles event was added. A hammer throw competition was also a new event, which has never been included in our country's National Games, and is a competition that our country has never practiced. Yesterday's competition had a promotional and performance nature. Wu Zhenwu, a representative of our country, created a result of 43.47 meters, which is truly remarkable.</p>
<p>The Western expatriate sports athletes in this city are lacking in talent, and there were not many participants. The relay teams were all hastily assembled, so yesterday's competition was not scored. Only the top four finishers in each event were recorded.</p>
<h3>The Most Valuable Gains in Track and Field: Javelin Throws Out A Dark Horse</h3>
<p>The track and field events consisted of seven disciplines, which were completed smoothly in the morning and afternoon. The process was as follows: The javelin final began at 10:30 a.m., with more than ten participants. Among the foreigners, there were many burly figures, but their throws were awkward. Only Dixon of the American School managed to barely reach the 40-meter mark after several throws. The rest were dominated by Chinese athletes. Wang Xuewu of the Navy, whose leg injury had not yet healed, also achieved a result of 46.94 meters after several trial throws. However, Mr. Wang gave up calculating his ranking and score, so he was not listed. Zhang Xingxian from Taiwan originally took the lead with 47.65 meters, but unexpectedly, Huang Renyuan of the Air Force emerged as a dark horse, achieving 47.92 meters, surpassing all competitors and even exceeding the score of Chen Jichuan, the national javelin champion. Mr. Chen went to Beijing yesterday, and Zhu and others participated as representatives. Mr. Huang was temporarily drafted as a representative and surprisingly fulfilled his mission. Congratulations! The rankings are as follows: (1) Huang Renyuan (2) Zhang Xingxian (3) Xu Tiande (4) Wang Rui.</p>
<p>Discus Final: There were six participants, two Chinese and four foreigners. Qi Peilin's reputation was illustrious. His first throw reached 42.15 meters, surpassing his own national record of 41.5 meters set at this National Games. Another throw reached * * *.60 meters. The foreigners were all * * *. Wang Rui of the Air Force always made a "hmm" sound when releasing the discus, but his score was not weak, taking second place. Smith of the U.S. Navy, with a physique like King Kong, looked good but was useless, sharing third and fourth place with Bao Lai from the YMCA.</p>
<p>Shot Put Final: Began at 2 p.m. with seven participants. Qi Peilin from Tianjin threw casually and achieved 12.91 meters, further improving his大会record of 12.72 meters set at this competition by .19 meters. Old Qi is truly adorable. Bing Mingchuan from Taiwan displayed a fierce spirit, and his powerful throw reached 12.65 meters. Smith of the U.S. Navy only managed 12.30 meters, falling to third place. The fourth place went to Wu Zhenwu (Navy).</p>
<p>High Jump Final: Held concurrently with the shot put final, with six participants. Among them, Liu Mengjiu of the Army only tried jumping for his personal score and did not count his ranking, so there were actually only five people. Starting from 1.60 meters, everyone cleared it. When the bar was raised to 1.65 meters, Hess and Jeter of the YMCA failed three times each, and all the foreigners were eliminated. It became a pure competition among Chinese athletes. When the bar was raised to 1.78 meters, only Dong Feixing cleared it effortlessly. Zhang Liren and Yang Jirong failed three times each and were also defeated. When it was raised to 1.82 meters again, Feixing failed once, but cleared the bar easily on the second attempt, as graceful and beautiful as a kite turning over. Feixing was ambitious and immediately raised it to 1.85 meters, but failed both times, ultimately ending the competition with a record of 1.82 meters. The rankings are: (1) Dong Feixing (Taiwan) (2) Zhang Liren (Taiwan) (3) Yang Pihua (Taiwan) (4) Hess (YMCA).</p>
<p>Hammer Throw Final: Was the last event in yesterday's track and field events in the morning. This type of sport is still being officially introduced for public competition in our country for the first time. Only Wu Zhenwu from the Navy participated in this sport, while the other four were foreigners. Among them, only Miller of the American Legion had some skill in this sport, while the rest were mostly amateurs. Wu Zhenwu, however, had some research on this * *. Yesterday * * * was methodical, and several turning postures were especially beautiful, winning much applause from the audience. He threatened Miller several times, and Miller, fearing being * *, used all his strength, resulting in an injury to his left arm. The hammer throw results were only considered for Miller and Wu because only they were good enough. Miller's score was 43.47 meters, and Wu Zhenwu's was 42.65 meters.</p>
<p>Long Jump Final: There were ten participants in the long jump, Chinese and foreign athletes. Zhang Liren won the championship with 6.64 meters. Huang Jian was second with 6.62 meters, only slightly different. Li Fen was third with 6.35 meters, and Soviet Novo-Golov was fourth with 6.315 meters. The remaining six all failed to surpass the 6-meter mark. Zhang Liren only achieved 6.64 meters on his sixth jump, while Huang Jian achieved 6.62 meters on his second jump, but did not improve in the subsequent four attempts. Li Fen's score was also achieved on his sixth jump. Yesterday's long jump scores were mediocre, but slightly better than the 6.47 meters at the National Games.</p>
<p>Triple Jump: In the triple jump, there were also three Chinese athletes participating, and they swept the top three spots. Huang Jian won the championship with 14.10 meters, Zhang Liren was second, and Zhang Liren was third. Only one foreigner, Stucker of the YMCA, was selected, placing fourth. Huang Jian's score was slightly better than the 14.01 meters at the National Games.</p>
<h3>Westerners' Strength Too Weak: Six Defeats in Seven Track Events</h3>
<p>Seven track events were also held. The competition process is briefly described below:</p>
<p>100 Meters: Xu Tiande and Wang Songtao won first and second place respectively, without much effort. However, in the 200 meters, Xu Tong and Xu Tiantong encountered a strong opponent and were defeated by A. Ivanov of the YMCA. The score was 23 seconds flat, which was the only victory for the Western team in all track events yesterday.</p>
<p>400 Meters: Was temporarily cancelled because no foreigners participated.</p>
<p>800 Meters: With Yu Xiwei and Li Linglong representing the Chinese team, it was easy to win. Yu and Li had a fierce competition, and Li briefly surpassed at 700 meters, but Yu Xiwei's final sprint was effective, taking first place by about three meters. The three Western athletes were left behind by at least fifty meters.</p>
<p>1500 Meters: The strength of the Westerners was too disparate, and it was still a one-sided situation. Yu Xiwei defeated Yang Liansheng by about twenty meters.</p>
<p>110-Meter Hurdles: Huang Liangzheng had just recovered from a minor illness. Although he won first place, he was not satisfied. He knocked down the first and second hurdles, causing him to fall slightly behind, but gradually returned to normal after clearing the third hurdle. Xu Baochen was slightly weaker, finishing second. The Westerners' skills were not refined and there was little to describe.</p>
<p>200-Meter Low Hurdles: This event was temporarily added at the request of the Westerners. Rong Chengbi and Zhang Zhiqing joined as guest participants, winning first and second place respectively. Xu Baochen finished fourth, and American soldier George took third place.</p>
<p>400-Meter Relay: Only the Chinese, Soviet, American School, and YMCA teams participated. The Chinese team, represented by four athletes from Taiwan, namely Xu Tiande in the first leg, Lin Qiujiang in the second leg, Chen Xinhui in the third leg, and Xu Tong in the fourth leg, won very easily.</p>
<p>1600-Meter Relay: Only the Chinese and YMCA teams participated. The Chinese team led all the way, with a difference of fifty meters. The Chinese team representatives were Chen Wenyan in the first leg, Zhao Xuehong in the second leg, Zhou Zhixiong in the third leg, and Peng Kaizuo in the fourth leg.</p>

<h3>A Fine Tale on the Tennis Courts: Ye Guanxiong and Yang Weibin, a Virtuous Couple, Reside Separately on the King and Queen Thrones. The Men's and Women's Doubles Championships Await Unveiling Today.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The men's tennis singles championship was produced yesterday. Ye Guanxiong from Guangzhou and his wife, Yang Weibin, each won the men's and women's singles championships respectively. Tao Guanqiu, who was initially the most highly touted to win the title, suffered a defeat in yesterday's final against Ye Guanxiong, falling to second place. Xu Weipei from Hong Kong was third, and Wang Wenzheng from the police was fourth. Yang Weibin's victory over Chen Jinshi from Indonesia a few days ago laid the foundation for her championship seat. This Javanese expert was forced to be ranked second. Zhu Zhiying from Shanghai was third, and Lu Yuanchun from Malaysia brought up the rear.</p>
<p>The men's and women's doubles championships will also be decided this morning. Judging from the battles of the past two days, the Xu brothers from Hong Kong have the highest hopes for the men's doubles, while the women's doubles is already in the bag for Indonesia.</p>
<p>The women's singles consolation tournament champion was Wang Jinshu from Guizhou. This is the result of continuous forfeits. The women's singles consolation tournament only had two matches actually played, with forfeits on one side in the remaining matches. Zhou Shuan from Fujian also forfeited in yesterday's consolation final.</p>
<p>The men's singles consolation tournament will hold the semi-finals at 9 a.m. today, and the winners will hold the final at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>As for the men's and women's doubles consolation tournament, due to the expiration of the competition period, it was decided not to hold it. All other tennis matches will be completed this morning.</p>
<p>In yesterday's men's singles final, Ye Guanxiong's match against Tao Guanqiu was particularly calm yesterday. His net attacks were repeatedly successful, and he finally defeated Guanqiu. Wang Wenzheng and Xu Weipei battled fiercely for four sets, with evenly matched results, but Wang Wenzheng forfeited in the fifth set due to physical exhaustion. Yang Weibin defeated Zhu Zhiying easily in the women's singles, winning the championship. The results are listed below:</p>

<p>The Tao-Ye Battle: Two and a Half Hours: Tao Guanqiu's decision in the final against Guanxiong The final yesterday lasted two and a half hours before a winner was decided. Tao Guanqiu's steady strokes were eventually broken by Ye's fierce high-pressure shots. After Tao and Ye each won one set, the third set became a stalemate. Ye Guanxiong managed to hold his breath and won 8-6. In the fourth set, Tao Guanqiu was unable to continue. Summarizing, he lost the throne 3-1.</p>
<p>Doubles Final: Tao and Wang Forfeit In yesterday afternoon's doubles final, policemen Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng forfeited. Ma Hua's Xie Luohua and Lin Xizhen scored two points. The Xu brothers defeated Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan in straight sets. Yesterday, Chen and Li's performance was far less exciting than their match against Tao and Wang the day before, with many errors. The Xu brothers, on the other hand, cooperated well.</p>
<p>Women's Doubles: Ma and Yin Win In the women's doubles, Shanghai originally could have defeated Malaysia, but they were too eager to win and became flustered, eventually losing 2-1. Chen Jinshi and Zhang Meishan from Indonesia cooperated better. Luo Qiaoer from Guangzhou was weaker and made many mistakes. Yang * * * could not support the team alone and had to succumb.</p>

<h3>Referee Xu Shaowu's Injury Will Recover</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] During the Shanghai vs. Dalian football match on the 9th of this month, after Dalian lost 3-1 to Shanghai, they took their anger out on referee Xu Shaowu and beat him. The referee committee severely punished them afterward, details of which have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Mr. Xu's injury is recovering, but the organizing committee will file a lawsuit with their legal advisor. As for Mr. Xu's lost watch, the organizing committee has subsidized him 10 million national currency as compensation for his loss.</p>
<h3>The Last Act of the Football Championship Ends: Police, Hong Kong, and Army Share the Championship. Yesterday's Match Resulted in Two Draws for Police and Army.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday was the last day of the football round robin. Because Shanghai's qualification was cancelled and Hong Kong had a bye, the only match was between Police and Army. Recently, due to frequent football disputes, the organizing committee strengthened security to prevent accidents, prohibiting all idlers from entering the field. Even newspaper reporters and photographers who were allowed to enter the field according to the organizing committee's regulations were kept out. Xuan * , * Shuping, Hao Gengsheng, and others sat high on rattan chairs, personally taking charge at the edge of the field, which attracted the attention of the entire audience. Spectators who had turned to the track and field field because the swimming pool and stadium were full, facing the solemn and tense atmosphere in the field, held their breath and watched quietly. The players of the Police and Army teams completed the final decisive battle for the championship in this special environment. Yesterday, the two teams played extremely loosely in the first half, and the situation was tighter in the second half. The Army team's tactics had made great progress, while the Police team had little performance other than short passes from the forwards. Therefore, the final * ended in a two-to-two draw.</p>
<p>At the same time as the battle unfolded, the Army Telecom team * protested again to the organizing committee regarding the Hong Kong team's foul in the Hong Kong vs. Army match. After the organizing committee convened a meeting to discuss the matter, they concluded that Hong Kong team member Liu Fuquan did indeed enter the field twice, and the referee did not notice, which * violated the football rules. The match should have been replayed, but because the organizing committee's closing ceremony was imminent and could not be held, it was decided that the Hong Kong vs. Army match at 4 p.m. on the 13th would be a draw, with each team receiving one point. After two important decisions and announcements by the organizing committee, the football disputes that had been disturbing for several days resulted in the following situation:</p>
<p>Chen Jinshi and Zhang Meishan (Indonesia) 2 0 4</p>
<p>Yang Weibin and Luo Qiaoer (Guangzhou) 1 1 2</p>
<p>Lu Yuanchun and Chen Junyu (Malaysia) 1 1 2</p>
<p>Zhu Zhiying and Ruan Li (Shanghai) 0 2 0</p>
<p>In summary, the results of this football round robin were that the Police, Hong Kong, and Army teams had the same score, and the number of goals scored was also the same. Therefore, the organizing committee decided to share the championship, and the three teams received the championship. The football championship round robin thus came to a successful end.</p>
<h3>Referee Resigns: Group Leader Takes the Field Personally The Competition Process Was Not Tense</h3>
<p>Yesterday's match was held because the referee resigned and no one was willing to take the position. The head of the referee group, Jiang Lianggui, finally took the field personally, and Le Xiurong, chairman of the Shanghai Football Referee Association, and Fu Luoju, director of athletics at Nankai University, served as linesmen, allowing the match to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>The match started at 4:45 p.m. The attack of the * team was not as tense as imagined. The Army forwards were more agile, and the Police seemed less brave and calm than in the previous two days. Both offense and defense were unusually weak. As a result, Luo Shou * and Zhang Jinhai took advantage, and after two passes, Gao Xiuqing caught up and headed the ball. The ball was not swift, but it went into the net. After that, Police center Zhao Fu led the team to counterattack. Within a few minutes, he dribbled the ball straight to the enemy's goal and shot from the left corner, scoring. This goal showed skill and power, so it won a lot of applause. The first half ended with a score of one to one.</p>
<p>After the start of the second half, Army defender Meng Yiliang first committed a handball. Xie Jinhe missed both penalty kicks. After a brief * , center Meng bumped into a player in the penalty area and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Xie Jinhe took the kick and hit the ground, increasing the Police's score and boosting their morale. The short passes of the forwards were even more skilled. Wu Qixiang of the Army had not recovered from his foot injury and was replaced by Jiang Wenqing. Because he was very afraid that the defense would not be able to withstand the sharpness, he especially strengthened the Meng Xue line in the center, suppressing the Police forwards in every possible way. In a situation where the Police could not launch an attack, Zhang Jinhai got the ball and advanced quickly, taking a fierce shot that was blocked by Yu Yaode. While Yu was still in shock, Jinhai supplemented the shot and succeeded. After the score was tied at two to two, both sides were still thinking about finding an opportunity to rise again. As a result, Jin Lusheng and Xie Jinhe repeatedly showed excellent technical performances, but because time quickly ended, the two teams finally drew.</p>
<p>Police Team:</p>
<p>Jin Yaode Zeng Zhongyun Zheng Yingquan Mo Jinsong You Huaxing Liu Guangcai * Zhenhui Liu Tianshen * Fu Li Bingzhao Xie Jinhe</p>
<p>Army Team:</p>

<h3>Sichuan Defeats Navy in Consolation Match</h3>
<p>In another football consolation match, Sichuan faced the Navy at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the 15th. As a result, Sichuan won 3-2.</p>
<h3>Football Match Dispute Incident: Hubei Team Presents Three Opinions</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Hubei athletes team, regarding the dispute over the football elimination match between their team and Nanjing, specially hosted reporters yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Yu Jinsong, Chief of the Education Department of the Hubei Provincial Government and head of the team, along with football instructor Zeng Zichen, reported the facts of the incident, stating that their team did not engage in any physical assault. They claimed that this could be verified by the audience and journalists present at the scene, and acknowledged the unfairness of the refereeing at the event. Currently, the Hubei team has issued the following three points of opinion: (1) For the sake of protecting Hubei's reputation, the claims made by the organizing committee are inconsistent with the facts, and therefore, they cannot accept the punishment imposed upon them. (2) They request that the organizing committee provide concrete evidence of the assault, and the Hubei side will immediately admit wrongdoing and take responsibility for handing over the individuals involved. (3) The organizing committee's handling of this incident is absolutely unfair. The punishment given to Hubei in this event is more severe than that given to other units with evidence of assaulting referees, which is quite strange. The Hubei side has already submitted the above opinions in writing to the organizing committee, hoping for a reasonable resolution in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Football Team Also Raises Questions</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The Shanghai football team, after forfeiting their match against the police and being penalized with a suspension from competition by the Judging Committee, also submitted questions to the organizing committee yesterday. They believe that Wang Wenzheng and Xu Weipei also forfeited a tennis match, but still appeared for the afternoon match without any penalties from the organizing committee. Therefore, they request an investigation and equal treatment for all. According to inquiries made by our reporter with relevant parties, the congress is scheduled to conclude today, and these two disputes may likely remain unresolved.</p>
<h3>Ban on Reporters Entering the Venue: Newspapers Lodge Protests</h3>
<p>The interviewing and photography reporters from various newspapers in the city have lodged a protest with the National Games due to their inability to enter the venue yesterday to cover the news of the army vs. police football match. The content of the protest letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, during the army vs. police football championship round-robin match held at the National Games athletics field, news reporters and photography reporters from our newspapers and others were all prohibited from entering the venue for interviewing and photography. According to Articles 8 and 9 of the 'National Games News and Photography Reporter Interview Regulations' stipulated by the organizing committee's publicity team, news reporters and photography reporters may enter the athletics competition venue for interviewing and news gathering, with the following limitations on the number of people allowed: A. Each newspaper with a sports section is allowed one person. B. Other special circumstances will be decided by the review committee. It is clear that there was no blanket ban on reporters entering the venue. Furthermore, at the time, there were several individuals inside the venue who were not authorized to be there, claiming to be "standing committee members," arrogantly sitting on rattan sofas and acting like a privileged class. This measure by the organizing committee clearly violates its own regulations. We hereby formally lodge a protest and request an immediate response."</p>
<h3>Resolving Football Match Disputes: Judging Committee Decides, Equal Scores, Tied Rankings</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The National Games Judging Committee held its fifth committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM in the Municipal Sports Academy Principal's Office on the second floor of the swimming pool. Chairman Wang Zhengting, committee members Wu Bangwei, Song Junfu, Gao Zi, Liu Huakun, and Qian Xucang were in attendance. Hao Gengsheng, Shao Rugan, and others were also present, totaling more than ten people. The resolutions included two items:</p>
<p>(1) Discussion of the protest raised by the army team regarding the Hong Kong vs. army football match at 4:00 PM on the 13th. Resolution: During the Hong Kong vs. army football match, Hong Kong team member Liu Fuquan entered the field twice. The referee did not immediately verify this at the time, which violated football rules. The match should have been replayed. However, since the congress is about to close and a replay is impossible, the match should be considered a draw, with each team receiving one point.</p>
<p>(2) Discussion on how to handle situations where teams have equal scores in various ball game competitions. Resolution: 1. Women's volleyball: Shanghai, Hunan, and Taiwan have equal scores and are tied for champion. Guangzhou is fourth. 2. Men's volleyball: Police, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou have equal scores and are tied for champion. Shanghai is fourth. 3. Women's basketball: Shanghai is champion. Indian-Chinese, Fujian, and Philippine-Chinese have equal scores and are tied for runner-up. 4. Men's softball: Taiwan is champion. Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Police have equal scores and are tied for runner-up. 5. Football: Police, Hong Kong, and Army have equal scores and are tied for champion.</p>
<h3>Splashing Waves: Malayan-Chinese Water Polo - Brilliant and Radiant</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Hong Xucai</p>
<p>[Special report from our newspaper] The Malayan-Chinese water polo team has a history of over ten years. Since its establishment, it has won every battle and has been invincible. It has a reputation as the "ever-victorious team" in Malaya.</p>
<p>In 1936, when the World Games were held in Berlin, Japan won the swimming championship. After the World Games concluded, when Japanese athletes were returning to their country from Berlin, they passed through Singapore and had a friendly match with the Malayan-Chinese water polo team. The Malayan-Chinese team surprisingly defeated Japan by a score of 9 to 5. From then on, Japan had to view the Malayan-Chinese water polo team in a different light, and the world had to re-evaluate its strength.</p>
<p>The Malayan-Chinese water polo team has a very glorious record: In 1940, when the Hong Kong swimming team traveled to Malaya, there was a water polo match, which the Malayan-Chinese team won by a score of 10 to 0. Before coming to Shanghai, they also played a match against the Military United Football Team, and won by a score of 9 to 2. This time, to attend the National Games, they also held a competition with the famous Penang water polo team in that area, and defeated Penang by a score of 8 to 0.</p>
<p>Each member of the Malayan-Chinese water polo team has fifteen to twenty years of experience. They absolutely have the confidence when it comes to playing water polo. They hope to find an opportunity to attend the World Games to be held in London in July. All preparations are being discussed by the Singapore World Games Organizing Committee.</p>
<h3>He Lutian Returns to Malaya: First Thing is a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The water polo team has a total of seven members, with He Lutian taking on the role of coach. When Mr. He spoke of the Malayan-Chinese water polo team, he seemed unable to suppress his proud demeanor. Coach He set off from Singapore to Shanghai. In his haste, he accidentally ran over and killed a person on the street. The car overturned, and he sustained skin injuries all over his body. This matter is still unresolved, so he said, "The first thing I have to do upon returning to Malaya is face a lawsuit."</p>
<h3>Backstroke Champion Huang Bixia: Ten Years of Water Sports</h3>
<p>The Malayan-Chinese swimming athletes, totaling nineteen, must all arrive half an hour before the start of the swimming competition each day, line up and sit in the right corner of the pool, and constantly cheer for the Malayan-Chinese athletes. In yesterday's program, the Malayan-Chinese team won several finals championships, so their emotions were particularly excited.</p>
<p>The Malayan-Chinese athlete Huang Bixia, who won the women's 100-meter backstroke final, is twenty-four years old and has been swimming for ten years. She is already the mother of three children.</p>
<p>During the finals, Malayan-Chinese athlete Zhong Yaobo suddenly experienced leg cramps. After being pulled out of the water, he was immediately carried by the Boy Scouts to the medical office, where the nurse applied turpentine. Along the way, Zhong Yaobo kept shouting "Ouch" repeatedly.</p>
<p>Malayan-Chinese athletes from Singapore said that their local white uniforms are more beautiful than Shanghai's, with crisp material and a well-fitting style. The clothes of the Shanghai nursing sisters are made too big.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese male athletes unanimously praised the beauty of Shanghai ladies, their fair skin, and good figures, which are rare to see elsewhere.</p>
<p>Runner-up Zhang Yunying from Taiwan, age nineteen, is a senior student at Taipei First Girls' High School. She has been swimming for five years and has won the Taiwan Provincial Games championship twice.</p>
<p>Third-place Zheng Yanying from Guangdong-Guangzhou, age fourteen, is one of the Zheng sisters. Her younger sister, Xueying, is only thirteen years old and has only been swimming for one year. This time, the sisters came to Shanghai with the Guangzhou delegation alone and stayed at the Central Training Corps dormitory, taking care of everything themselves. The previous two days, due to eating the wrong things, they suffered from diarrhea, so their performance greatly declined. Su Tianmo, the coach of the Guangzhou swimming team, expressed great regret. In the past two days, he has personally increased supervision of the sisters' diet.</p>

<h3>Volleyball Finals: Parting Glances, Unexpected Upsets for Both Men and Women. Final Results: Men: Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Police; Women: Taiwan, Hunan, Shanghai – All Tied for Champion</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the men's and women's volleyball round-robin finals yesterday morning, there were two unexpected upsets: the Shanghai women's team lost to Hunan by a score of 0-2, and the Hong Kong men's team also lost to the police by a score of 0-3. Therefore, in the men's and women's round-robin results, three teams each scored four points (men's volleyball: Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Police; women's volleyball: Taiwan, Hunan, Shanghai), tying for champion. In another men's volleyball championship match, Guangzhou defeated Shanghai 3-1. The scoring table for the men's volleyball championship round-robin is listed below:</p>
<p>Men's Volleyball</p>
<p>Team Name Wins Losses Score</p>
<p>Hong Kong 2 1 4</p>
<p>Guangzhou 2 1 4</p>
<p>Police 2 1 4</p>
<p>Shanghai 0 3 0</p>
<p>Women's Volleyball</p>
<p>Team Name Wins Losses Score</p>
<p>Shanghai 2 1 4</p>
<p>Taiwan 2 1 4</p>
<p>Hunan 2 1 4</p>
<p>Guangzhou 0 3 0</p>
<p>Why Didn't the Referee Come?</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hunan women's volleyball final, after the unpleasant breakup at the Municipal Sports Hall last time, was decided by the Organizing Committee Refereeing Committee to be replayed yesterday morning. Both teams' players arrived at the venue at 9:00 AM, but after waiting for a long time, the referee had not arrived. People in the venue all said that no one might be willing to be the enforcer of this volleyball match, because the scene of shouting and fighting at the Sports Hall last time had given people a very bad impression. However, after half an hour, the referee Xu Minhui finally arrived slowly, and the match immediately began.</p>
<p>Strange! Shanghai's Performance is Perplexing</p>
<p>The Shanghai women's volleyball team, in this round-robin competition, had successively defeated Taiwan and Guangzhou, and each performance was of high quality. Especially with the presence of sand court veterans Chen Meizhen, Huang Mingyuan, Wang Weizhen, etc., there was no doubt that they would win the championship this time. Last time at the Municipal Sports Hall, they also defeated the Hunan team by a score of 21-4 in the first game; unexpectedly, yesterday, each veteran had an abnormal performance, and Chen Meizhen and others contributed almost nothing. Especially in the final stage of the second game, the more they lost, the more chaotic they became, completely falling into a passive position, and losing in a perplexing manner!</p>
<p>Weird! Like Two Different People Before and After</p>
<p>In the first round, the Shanghai army was at a disadvantage and lost points consecutively. The Hunan side's Zheng Peikun constantly attacked with fierce spikes, while Shanghai's killer Chen Chengzhen could not block the net and did not get a good opportunity to kill the ball. Even if she did kill it, it was plain and unremarkable, and not enough to achieve success. Huang Mingyuan did not see any new achievements, and compared to the past, she was like two different people. Therefore, the furthest difference in points was 10 to 20. Finally, although Meizhen and others pulled back a few balls, they still lost 14 to 21.</p>
<p>Alas! Losing the Entire Country</p>
<p>During the intermission, the Shanghai side tried to counterattack, once forming a four-point tie. Later, Meizhen and others used their old tricks again, specializing in attacking the Hunan team's weakest third row, gaining a lead of 7 to 4. Then they regained an advantage of 15 to 12. Everyone thought that Shanghai could save the overall situation, but after a 15-point tie, the Shanghai ladies almost fell into a slump. The Hunan team served, and the Shanghai army could not respond. Before long, the Shanghai team was at a disadvantage of 16 to 21, losing the entire great country.</p>
<p>Hunan: Zheng Peiji, Liu Xingheng, Zheng Peikun, Qin Benze, Zeng Yuyuan, Liu Yunshan, Chen Chunxiu, Liao Zhiqiang, Liu Zhulan</p>
<p>Shanghai: Zhu Jinyun, Chen Meizhen, Wang Shan, Chen Liuzhen, Wang Weizhen, Huang Mingyuan, Xiang Yulin, Chen Jieshu, Lu Zhaoshan</p>
<p>Tragic! Hong Kong's Loss is So Bitter</p>
<p>In the men's volleyball battle between Hong Kong and the police, Hong Kong faced the police with its original lineup, but its net blocking technique was broken by the police (according to reports, the police took advantage of the quick kill and speed spike angles, which made Hong Kong's net blocking technique fail). At the same time, they defended more than they attacked, so the police's strategy of "attacking with all their strength" worked wonders, causing Hong Kong to suffer an unprecedented defeat.</p>
<p>Fortunately! Finally Regaining Lost Ground</p>
<p>What made people have high hopes for Hong Kong was that in the Hong Kong-Guangzhou battle at the Municipal Sports Hall before, the Hong Kong team was indeed exceptionally skilled. By the time of the Hong Kong-Shanghai battle, Hong Kong had slightly regressed, and yesterday was especially bad. In the first game yesterday, the opening repeatedly became a tie. The Hong Kong side once had good contact, and the three rows of ball assists were also successful. However, after the fourth point, Hong Kong felt the threat of the police's front row left-wing spike, and even the good player Zhong Shiyuan lost the ball. Fortunately, Yu Qien fought back with a fierce spike, regaining lost ground. They once competed with the police side by side at the ninth and tenth points. After that, the Hong Kong army's spike was bounced back by the opponent. In this way, the police side fought hard and won the first game 21 to 14.</p>
<p>Good! The Police Have Face</p>
<p>In the second game, the police team took the lead. The Hong Kong front row repeatedly lost points by touching the net with their hands, which wronged many good balls. The police's first row left spike specialized in attacking the weaknesses of the Hong Kong team (third row right), scoring many points. The entire Hong Kong team almost all lost their composure. In terms of contact, the ball supply and ball delivery were not working. Yu Qien was also shut down by the opponent. Therefore, Hong Kong entered a state of hard defense. It is known that this defensive situation created a passive stance. Therefore, the police were able to achieve a great victory of 21 to 4.</p>
<p>Pity! The Hong Kong Team Miscalculated Everything</p>
<p>In the last round, the police team had already won two games, and their energy was abundant. The attack became more and more energetic. The false movements of the front row achieved quite good results. Although Hong Kong calmly fought hard, they once got a seven-point tie, but the overall situation did not improve. When changing sides, the Hong Kong side replaced Shao Xianrong, who lost many balls in the third row right, with Zhao Shijian, but it still did not help the overall situation. Since then, Hong Kong made more and more mistakes, and finally lost the third game 13 to 21, causing the entire army to be destroyed, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>Police: Yi Ruijian, Ren Xianzhan, Huang Yongdong, Ni Peilin, Chen Xianghua, Huang Yumin, Jun Yule, Li Rujiu, Wu Quanjun</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Lin Runming, Chen Changyong, Ouyang Zhaotang, Chen Shude, Wang Yaomin, Yu Qien, Zhao Shirun, Zhong Shiyuan, Li Limei</p>
<p>(Li Limei replaced Shao Xianrong in the second half of the third game)</p>
<p>Fortunately! The Personnel Adjustment is Not Bad</p>
<p>In the men's volleyball match between Shanghai and Guangzhou, although the Shanghai team was generally expected to win the fourth place in the recent round-robin competition, each of the three battles did show improvement, which cannot be said to be unrelated to the adjustment of the lineup. For example, the original lineup had Zhan Chen playing the first row right, and his performance was very unsatisfactory, but after replacing him with Wang Junbing, the team's strength greatly changed, because Wang's fierce spike had unique merit. Yesterday, Wang Junbing also made many achievements. At the same time, after Zheng Yiquan and Weng Chengguang re-switched positions yesterday, they made many achievements in the attack. Huang Xiuhua seems to be more suitable for playing in the third row left than in the third row middle. Shanghai won the first game yesterday, and it was entirely due to the attack of Wang, Zheng, Weng, and others, and the ball supply of Huang Xiuhua, Cheng Shining, and others.</p>
<p>Weak! Shanghai Expected it Would be Difficult to Win</p>
<p>However, in terms of the power of attack, the average of strength, and the disguised attack, the Shanghai team was naturally inferior to Guangzhou. For example, Li Lianze in the front row of Guangzhou and Chen Rongkuan in the back row were both better than Shanghai's Zhuan Jia and Cheng Shining. Yesterday, after the Shanghai team won the first game, they lost the next three games, which was also expected.</p>
<p>Numbers! This is Not a Sin of War</p>
<p>In the first game yesterday, the Shanghai team took full attack, and the two generals in the front row middle and right, and the two wings in the second row contributed a lot; in the next three games, the Shanghai team continued to develop its original combat power. However, Guangzhou's three-row left and right wings spikes were very strong, and Shanghai was mostly unable to rescue them. However, the Shanghai team had also fully exerted its combat power, so although all three games were lost, the scores were not too far apart. The scores of the four games were: 14-21, 21-15, 21-17, 21-11.</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Pan Jinhong, Li Lianze, Zhou Hao, Zhao Lianwu, Mei Yi, Mei Songfu, Zhao, Chen Yingkuan, Li Xinglin</p>
<p>Shanghai: Wang Junbing, Kong, Weng Guang, Wei Dingsen, Zheng Yiquan, Peng Zhongquan, Cheng Shining, Huang Xiuhua</p>

After that, the two armies advanced step by step and did not score any points. Taiwan won 4 to 2, winning the men's group championship. The men's group results already played are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Men's Softball Competition All Over: Fujian Wins Elimination Championship: Victory Over Navy by a Score of Seventeen to Six</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The men's softball elimination final between Fujian and the Navy was held at Yiyuan yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The Fujian team is the incarnation of the former Shanghai Sharks team. Most of the team members are students from St. John's University. They have tacit understanding and rich experience. The strength of the Navy team is also strong. Let us first recognize the lineups of the two teams:</p>
<p>Fujian team: Zhang Zhaoyu, Pan Dade (pitcher), Wang Xiunan (catcher), Chen Cuixiang, Ye Weiquan (first base), Guo Dunli (second base), Wei Wu (third base), Cao Qijia (shortstop), Jiang Yanin (left field), Zhu Jizu (right field), Li Rongbang (center field).</p>

<p>The referee was Liang Fuchu. The Navy attacked first. The Fujian team's defense was tight, and the Navy failed to show its power. When Fujian switched from defense to attack, the Navy was timid and was scored four consecutive points by the Fujian team. In the second round, the Navy's Tan Naisheng safely returned to home base. In the fourth and fifth innings, the Fujian boys suddenly exerted their strength. Pan Dade hit safely, Zhu Jizu sacrificed, and the remaining six or seven people all returned to home base, scoring as many as thirteen points. Only Gao Songzhen, Huang Longshun, and others of the Navy scored. As a result, Fujian won the elimination tournament championship by a score of 17 to 6.</p>

<h3>Banks Continue to Tighten Credit, Financial Control Bureau Strictly Investigates Returned Checks</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the financial authorities continued to work hard to tighten credit and sell off materials, and general prices continued to fall. The National Treasury again transferred in 800 billion, and credit became even tighter, with black market interest rates as high as 30% or more. The market price of rice has stabilized. The Civil Adjustment Committee yesterday began to sell off. The China Industrial Trust Company is still selling off flour, priced at 1.85 million per bag, and sold off a total of 8,300 bags. Market conditions are generally bearish. Chinese stocks have fallen sharply, with Yong Yarn once falling to 2,560 yuan. Other Chinese stocks have also fallen. Among the commodities, sugar, artificial silk, cotton yarn, paper, and other prices have uniformly declined. Cotton yarn has even fallen by about 10%. According to observation, the May rally has almost passed.</p>
<p>The authorities continued to sell off materials and tighten credit. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus of the bill exchange again transferred in 874.4 billion. Foreign banks also transferred in 293 billion. Credit is tight as never before. The central bank transferred in 635.9 billion, China transferred in 64.2 billion, Transportation transferred out 97.4 billion, Farmers transferred in 78.9 billion, China Industrial Trust Company transferred in 185.4 billion, Postal Service transferred out 6.2 billion, Cooperative Treasury transferred in 13.6 billion. Big Exchange transferred out 500.7 billion, and Small Exchange transferred out 666.7 billion.</p>
<p>Recently, due to tight credit, the trend of bounced checks has revived. The number of bounced checks on the 14th reached as many as 900 billion. The Financial Control Bureau has begun to thoroughly investigate, and will legally investigate whether the responsibility belongs to the customer or the bank itself. According to Financial Control Bureau Director Li, the bounced checks occurred because of the use of checks for collateral. When the collateral exceeded the scope of the overdraft, if the customer's checks were presented for payment, the bank would refuse to pay, and naturally return the checks during exchange. Therefore, Director Li emphasized that the use of today's checks as collateral should never be allowed. The Ministry of Finance has set June 1st as the date for implementation, and Director Li said that he would strictly enforce it. The phenomenon of bounced checks can be avoided. If it happens again, the bank will be fully responsible. Director Li also explained that the checks that are being banned next month are checks without proper authorization. Bank drafts, certified checks, and others can all be used as collateral.</p>
<h3>Tight Money, Weak Rice Prices: The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Did Not Sell Yesterday; Flour Initially Weak Then Rose, While Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Continued to Fall</h3>
<p>The decline in the rice market has intensified, with prices falling within the range for selling off rice reserves. Therefore, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee did not release any yesterday. As the price at the production area of Wuxi reportedly fell significantly, public confidence is extremely low.

<h3>No New Buying, Many Trying to Unload: Yarn and Cloth Continue to Fall</h3>

<h3>Unauthorized Construction of Private Roads: Victims Can Sue According to Law</h3>
<p>[From all farmers in Jianmin Township, Hukuan, Suzhou] We are all farmers from Jianmin Township, Hukuan, Suzhou, making a living from agriculture. Unexpectedly, a certain [種類]school nearby has built a private road, using [等等]hundreds of acres of our good farmland without authorization, without any [手續]procedures or compensation for the land value. Most of our farming households are facing [飢餓]hunger and displacement because all of our good farmland has been occupied. We respectfully request answers to the following three questions, for which the farmers will be grateful!</p>
<p>(1) If the state [徵用]requisitions land for a [公共]public road, can the cost of the roadbed be [補償]purchased from the people? (2) Can the owners of the land on which a private road is built demand compensation from the builder or file a lawsuit? (3) Now that the road has been built, but the land has not been purchased nor has the owner's consent been obtained, can we request the competent authority to restore the land to its original state?</p>
<p>[Answer from lawyer Chuan Kuang] (1) The compensation for land price, compensation fees, and relocation fees that should be given for the requisition of land shall be determined by the competent municipal or county land administration agency. The person needing the land must pay these fees to the competent municipal or county land administration agency for transfer. (See Article 236 of the Land Law) (2) If a private road is built without applying for [徵收]requisition and approval and compensation for land prices in accordance with the Land Law, a [刑事]criminal lawsuit can be filed in accordance with Article 354 of the Criminal Law for damage [財產]property, and a [民事]civil request can be attached for restoration to the original state and compensation for damages. (3) You can jointly negotiate with them to restore the original state. If they ignore you, proceed according to law.</p>

<h3>On Respecting Officials</h3>
<p>— Xuanxuan</p>
<p>In this democratic era, this century of the people, to write "On Respecting Officials" instead of "On Despising Officials" shows how backward the person's mind is. But what I mean is that officials are also people, but officials are experts in governing the people, and this "governing" is entrusted to them by the people. Therefore, officials are a kind of [藝術]artistic talent, and what China lacks most is [藝術]artistic talents, so how can we not respect officials?</p>
<p>Chinese people often translate the English "Public servant" as "公僕" (public servant). This is really problematic. Treating technical talents who dedicate themselves to the people as domestic slaves in the feudal era is not a phenomenon that should exist in a democratic era. This word should be translated as "服務[於]公衆的人" (people who serve the public), so that the true character of officials can be revealed.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I attended a small banquet, mostly attended by so-called "national industrialists" of the middle class in Shanghai. Among them was someone who had just come from Nanjing. Talking about this election, someone took out 2 trillion, someone took out 800 billion, etc. Then a "national industrialist" Mr. A sighed with his head turned: "These are all the fat and [膏]grease of the people, aren't they our people's money?" "National industrialist" Mr. B nodded in approval. When I saw them in this spirit, it seemed a bit righteous. But then I thought, aren't they themselves also scraping the fat and grease of the people, taking the people's money? Who are the speculators? Who are the ones raising prices wildly? When officials take the people's money, it's called "corruption," a crime deserving of death. When businessmen rob the people's money, it's called "being good at business," not only is it not illegal, but it's as if the people's money deserves to be squeezed out of them. Today's laws [難道]aren't they more generous to businessmen than to officials? Thinking of the entourage of officials in the feudal era and comparing it with today's officials having to flatter businessmen, it really seems that being an official is the end of the road for those who have the art of governing the world. Why not do business, [卻]but be an official?</p>
<p>China is also one of the most demanding countries in terms of treatment of officials. The income of a specially appointed official is far less than that of opening a small cigarette and paper shop in an alley. What else is there to say? When corruption becomes a tool for a person to survive, what else can we demand? "The emperor does not send hungry soldiers." We can't even give them ordinary living expenses. Do we still have the face to scold people for corruption? If they don't corrupt, should we ask them to [餓]starve themselves and work for you? General Chen Cheng, who has been in the military for half his life, admitted that his salary was not enough to cover his expenses, and he had to rely on his wife's [嫁妝]dowry to subsidize his life. If this is the truth, then the people are really messed up.</p>
<p>In terms of pre-war living standards, a mayor's official salary of 2,000 yuan per month was definitely not excessive. In today's terms, that would be at least 1.2 billion per month, but if a mayor really took a monthly salary of 1.2 billion, some people would come out and say that this is too wasteful of the country's money. If it is a businessman, earning tens of billions or hundreds of billions per month is not uncommon. In fact, the mayor's 1.2 billion is the due reward for working for the citizens, while the businessman's earning tens of billions or hundreds of billions is nothing more than scraping money from the heads of the people. But the observations of ordinary people are so different, isn't it strange?</p>
<p>Since the situation of today's officials is so unfavorable, why are there so many officials still [佔]in positions, even scheming for them? This cannot but be attributed to the large number of "official talents" in our country. Any commodity, if it is oversupplied, will drop in price, and "official talents" are no exception. Thinking of this, I can't help but sigh three times for the officials! I also shed tears for this group of intellectuals and technical talents who have no way out in China!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have never held an official position in my life. Saying these words, I can say that I am not exaggerating my virtues, but truly sympathizing with others.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Hitting"</h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>"Hitting" in the twentieth century is a popular and exciting word. Apart from the two world wars that were "hit," usually in various parts of the world—especially in our China, which has been the case since ancient times and is even more prevalent today!—you can hear the sound of "hitting" at any time and see the scene of "hitting" everywhere. If you don't agree with each other, you wipe your [袖]sleeves and punch each other, starting a big fight. During the National Assembly meeting in the [耀武揚威]glare of domestic and foreign [耳]ears, there was an incident of fighting, and recently, the National Games has been constantly heard of "hitting." Examining our country's misuse of the word "hit" did not start today, it can be said to be a national essence that has existed since ancient times.</p>
<p>According to 歸田錄Gui Tian Lu: "Today, the corruption of common language, and all the gentlemen and villains in the world are the same in their mistakes, only the word "hit" is. Its meaning originally meant to examine and strike, so people fight each other, strike each other with objects, all are called hitting. And it is okay to say that craftsmen making gold and silver utensils also "hit", because it has the meaning of [衝]impact and striking. As for those who build boats and armies, they say building boats "hit boats" and building carts "hit carts," netting fish is called "hit fish," drawing water is called "hit water," serving food to laborers is called "hit food," giving clothes and rations to soldiers is called "hit clothes and rations," attendants holding umbrellas is called "hit umbrellas," using paste to stick paper is called "hit paste," using rulers to measure land is called "hit measure," raising one's hand to wipe the dizziness of the eyes is called "hit wipe," and even famous scholars and erudite scholars all say this, calling everything "hit," and after searching through the dictionaries, there is no such word (pronounced Ding Ya 反). Its meaning mainly examines and strikes, and the "hit" of it, since it is pronounced "Zhe Geng", in terms of character studies, the character "hit" is from hand from Ding, and Ding has the sound of striking objects, so the sound "Zhe Geng" is correct, I don't know why it turned into "Ding Ya.""</p>
<p>From this, we learn that this word "hit" is "the same mistake of gentlemen and villains." But although the word "hit" is lacking in literary sense, it doesn't matter much to say it orally. But if people really fight with real materials, it is a bit of that! In any case, it should be reviewed and corrected.</p>
<h3>Remembering Yu Shuyan</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>At Du Shou's charity performance last year, the most prominent among the famous actors from the north and south was Meng Xiaodong. On the first day she took the stage, the value of the flower baskets converted into cash broke Shanghai's record. She [戲]sang "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan" for three days, bewitching the entire Shanghai audience. At that time, walking into dance halls, bars, or cafes, you could often hear the lyrics "The wife doesn't need to be too fierce." Today, the male role [老生] is able to be so popular, it can really overwhelm Dr. Mei.</p>
<p>Meng Xiaodong learned this play from Yu Shuyan, and other plays such as "Catching and Releasing" were also personally taught by Yu Daxian (Yu Shuyan's alias). It's a pity that when Xiaodong became a disciple, Shuyan had already stopped performing. Otherwise, if Xiaodong could learn from the stage Yu Shuyan's hand and [眉]foot [舉]movements, and the natural combination of the ups and downs, speeds, and weights of his voice, then with Xiaodong's intelligence, she would definitely be able to become Yu Shuyan's successor.</p>
<p>Li Shaochun is also a disciple of Shuyan. He is proud of the play "Fighting Taiping". I have seen Shaochun's play, and I feel that he is still far from Shuyan. Before the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, every year when school let out for summer vacation, I would always go to Beiping to stay for a while. Shuyan's residence at No. 2 Chunshu Xia Lane was a must-visit place. Every three or four days, I often went to Shuyan's place with two or three friends late at night to [談]chat for [整]the day. Around 12 o'clock [子]midnight, Shuyan had finished eating cigarettes, and it was the time of his best [充沛]energy. Although he had not performed for a long time, he would always sing one or two plays every night to practice his voice, which really made people enjoy the [戲]opera. After listening to the opera, around one or two o'clock, we would eat [解兒餅]Jie'er pancakes for supper, which was also a kind of gastronomic pleasure. At that time, Shuyan was already ill. From his conversation, I learned that he became famous with the play "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box", and that his fatal illness was caused by the play "Fighting Taiping". I will briefly describe it below.</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan's first performance of "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box" is known in the most detail by Yu's friend Zhang Siye (Jifu). I will quote his words as follows: "In the early years of the Republic of China, Shuyan was singing in Shang Xiaoyun's troupe in a grain shop in Heyuan. One day, Xiaoyun had a hall meeting in Tianjin for three days. Shuyan wanted to take the lead alone, but he hesitated. Yu encouraged him to sing "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box". The play report was posted. On that day, Yu first arrived at the park and saw few listeners, so he was quite uneasy. He asked an old seat watcher, 'How do you think the audience will be tonight?' The seat watcher replied: "I can't say for sure. This year is the world of [花衫]Huashan and Qingyi, even if the [老闆]boss comes, it won't work." I was even more distressed when I heard this. If the play really didn't attract an audience, wouldn't I be hurting Shuyan? I went to Shuyan's house. Shuyan was practicing his voice and asked me how the audience in the park was. I replied that it was very good. After dinner, I went to Zhonghe Garden again. I entered from a long lane next to it. In the lane, I heard the [喧嘩]noise in the park. When I entered the park, I saw that it was crowded with people and it was already sold out, and I was very happy. Soon I saw Shuyan's face exposed from the side of the [幕]curtain on the stage, holding a [京八寸]Beijing eight-inch, which must have been very proud. On that day, Shuyan's voice was exceptionally [宏亮]loud, and his movements were extremely elegant. Shuanzi (Xia Changlin) and the woodcutter, Qian Jinfu and the evil spirit, were also very energetic. The sounds of [讚美]praise were endless. Shuyan became [唱紅]famous with this play, and Shang Xiaoyun was greatly surprised when he returned from Tianjin. From then on, he treated Shuyan differently." The above are the words of Zhang Siye, which show that it is not easy for a generation of artists to become famous.</p>
<p>Shuyan's signature play, in addition to "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box", was "Fighting Taiping". The last time Shuyan sang this play, he was fully dressed and ready to go on stage when he suddenly felt the urge to urinate. It took a long time to put on and take off the [紮靠]armor in this play. Shuyan relied on his strength and didn't want to miss the stage. Amidst the tense sound of the [鼓]drum, he still came out. After that, one scene was tighter than the other until he finished the play at one o'clock, and then he was able to relieve himself, already bloated to death. From then on, he was injured. Later, when he became seriously ill, he had to undergo surgery by a Western doctor to release urine. After the July 7th Incident, I was unable to travel north, so my friends in the capital wrote to me saying that Shuyan's illness was getting worse. Every time he urinated, he had to sit on the toilet for many minutes, releasing it drop by drop, which was extremely painful. Sometimes he even had to use a kind of tube. When the Japanese launched the Pacific War, American medicines and equipment were cut off. Shuyan used up the last "only tube" and died of this disease. It's really a pity.</p>
<p>The last time Shuyan took the stage was in 1935. The First Dance Hall outside Qianmen had a charity performance for disaster relief. Shuyan was specially invited to perform "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box". Coincidentally, I was in the capital and was able to witness the event. In the pool, I saw Ma Yunliang, Yi Xiaopei and Yu Yingfu and his son watching the play. Perhaps they were trying to learn something? Shuyan became famous with the play "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box", and he still used this play as his last masterpiece, which is really a coincidence.</p>
<h3>Time is Precious</h3>
<p>— Hongxian</p>
<p>Time is money, this is a very common saying.</p>
<p>At present, I feel that the value of a day is unbelievably great.</p>
<p>For example, postal and tram tickets, water and electricity bills, differ by one day, and there will be differences in money by several times. Suppose someone manages to plan a sum of money and prepares to go out tomorrow. Who knows, when he wakes up, the market will be very different, which is really ridiculous.</p>
<p>I remember that in the past, the price increases of public utilities were often discussed again and again before a few prices were added. Later, it became a periodic price increase, but usually it started at the beginning of the month. Therefore, people are inevitably a little apprehensive about waiting until the end of January, but after all, there is still time to prepare. Now it's not like that. Often it is decided today and the price will increase tomorrow, which makes people feel caught off guard. From now on, I will be apprehensive after the end of each day.</p>
<p>I hope that the value of time will be limited to "one day" and not reach the degree of "an inch of time is precious". If it gets to the point where the price is discussed this hour and the price increases next hour, I am afraid that most people will only prepare to commit suicide.</p>
<h3>Golden Flower Notes</h3>
<p>— Mingzhai</p>
<p>In 1947, Mexican President Alemán visited the United States and received a warm welcome from all levels of society. Wherever he went, cheers followed, truly making it the event of the moment. President Truman first held a grand banquet at the White House to welcome this distinguished guest; a few days later, President Alemán hosted a banquet at the Mexican Embassy in the United States, and Truman gladly accepted, fully demonstrating the friendship between the brotherly nations of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>However, a small tragicomedy was interspersed in this banquet!</p>
<p>The setting of this tragicomedy was, of course, the grand dining room of the Mexican Embassy in the United States, as mentioned above. That day, the dining room was decorated magnificently. Fresh flowers with rich fragrance were everywhere. A horseshoe-shaped long table was placed in the center of the hall, and the seats on both sides were painted gold. More than a hundred gentlemen and ladies who were invited to attend were all dressed up, and the sight of glittering jewelry was truly enviable.</p>
<p>In the middle of the banquet, President Truman stood up to toast the host and gave a short speech. According to the rules, everyone should stand up and toast...</p>
<p>The tragicomedy happened at this moment!</p>
<p>Just as the ladies and gentlemen in their soft evening gowns and the gentlemen in their stiff formal wear were about to stand up, a burst of rough "hissing" sounds suddenly filled the entire dining room! Some reserved male guests still strictly adhered to the etiquette in social situations and stood up to toast in a polite manner, while a small number of more curious guests couldn't help but secretly turn around to look at their own pants; the ladies, however, had already realized that something was wrong and were so anxious that they lost color in their faces!</p>
<p>And several counselors in the Mexican Embassy stared in dismay at the internationally renowned U.S. Senator Connally. It turned out that the old senator who laid the foundation for "bipartisan foreign policy," although he had stood up as required, was standing very awkwardly – the seat of the chair he was sitting on had become tightly united with his "rear," and Connally had stood up with his chair!</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the truth became clear. It turned out that the painter hired by the Mexican Embassy was particularly authentic. The repeated "gilding" of the chairs was indeed excellent, but the time was tight. Although it wasn't exactly "wet paint" during the banquet, at most it could only be said to be "newly dried paint." It just so happened that the weather was unusually hot that night, and very humid, which, combined, resulted in each chair being sticky, as if freshly coated with glue!</p>
<p>That day, whether male or female, everyone's "rear" was imprinted with a "golden flower" that slightly resembled a butterfly. Fortunately, both presidents had cushions on their seats, so they were spared the misfortune, which finally put the servants of the Mexican Embassy at ease after a moment of great panic.</p>
<h3>Northern City Chapter</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>This was written when I, Yu, declined guests at the ancient city corner of Tiantai. The situation changed drastically, the righteous men were all scattered, the white azaleas withered, the person to be arrested had not returned. I was about to be summoned to the western capital, but I had no one to entrust my young children to. The heavens and the earth were in pain, and how could people bear it? The most difficult situation to resolve in my life was none other than this moment! Therefore, there is another line saying: "How can there be dreams of turning over on a dangerous bed? It is difficult to open the gate of death with both hands." "It is futile for the sun, moon, stars, and frost to change; I would willingly die if it were appropriate, but I am also anxious." It's just that now that things have passed, it's as if it were a dream, and I can barely bear to recall it!</p>
<p>I live in the northern city, have an official position but no property, and several mouths depend on meager income for survival. Why should I indulge in this life? I still hope to be of help in the restoration! Before I knew it, a year had passed, and my white teeth were falling out one after another. In the new spring, the atmosphere of war rose, and the hall lamp sent a message to the corners of the sea. What can I say about the magistrate's hard work? I must calm my heart and be diligent. (I went with Magistrate Meng Shujian six hundred miles into the mountains and earnestly asked Shao Lingzheng for assistance for my brother, and borrowed weapons and supplies.) My wife in the mountain village also entrusted me with state affairs. The wind carried secret orders, and the scorched earth was expected to turn green again! The sand has just begun to take shape, and the situation among the pines has changed. It is appropriate to restrain all thoughts, and good and evil are strictly watched. In the desolate northern city, the wheat is yellow and people's shadows are lonely. Although there are two children, one cooks and the other does chores. The young daughter is most pitiful, doing all the work of a servant. Her body is short, and the bucket is high; she can barely reach the well. Her face is often covered in soot, and the rice is often half-cooked. The young son is also not spoiled, helping to chop firewood. Sometimes he is greedy for play, and in the end, he resents his older sister. The two little ones do not know how to yield, and inevitably cry and weep. Seeing this, I cannot bear to scold them, and I taste joy amidst suffering. Alas, this absurd situation is truly a soul-destroying den! I raise my whip to encourage my declining will, and the wheels of the chariot roll outside the door.</p>
