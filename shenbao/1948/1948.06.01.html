<p>〔本報訊〕本市專科以上各學校校長及敎授丁文淵，朱經農，李壽雍，胡敦復，凌憲揚，章益，程孝剛，劉海粟，潘序倫，歐元懷等三百三十八人，頃對美國扶植日本事，特於昨日聯名致函美國杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿表示意見，並通函全國敎育界徵求同意，原文如下：</p>
<p>美國杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務卿閣下，同人等鑒於貴國一部份負責人員，最近對於處置日本之主張，可能引起嚴重之錯誤，願以錚友之立塲略貢蒭蕘之見，吾人首先聲明，中美邦交至篤，兩國間人民之友誼，亦融洽無間。吾人對於貴國對，政策，如有所陳述，將完全出於誠懇的善意。</p>
<p>貴國對日政策，顧及日本國民基本生活之需要，不使陷於竭蹶之境，此乃基於人道立塲，與我國對於日本人民主張寬大之政策，正相吻合。然貴國近有允許日木將其工業提高至超過戰前水準之趨勢，且將予以鉅量物資與金錢之援助，此舉實非必要。至若欲將日本重新建立爲遠東工業中心，而使中國及其他亞洲國家爲其原料供給地，與其製成品之傾銷市塲。是日本於發動東亞戰爭時所抱之企圖，將由貴國促使其再度實現，中國爲抵抗此企圖，而從事八年堅苦抗戰所作之犧牲，以及貴國於對日作戰期間所受生命財產之損失，豈不等於浪費？</p>
<p>中國首先抵抗日本之侵略戰爭，作戰時間最長，所受之損害亦最慘重。中國人民生活狀况，視日本人民尤劣。然貴國對於中國之援助，幾經考量其數量尙不如貴國援助日本之慷慨，當吾人憶及貴我兩國乃係爲爭取民主比肩作戰之盟友，而日本乃係曾以無恥手段突襲貴國要害地點，殺傷貴國戰士之敵國時，吾人對於貴國現今擬加採用之扶植日本政策，實覺惶惑不解。如以正義爲衡量，我人深覺貴國亟宜將扶植日本之援助，轉用於中國。</p>
<p>若貴國人士中有人存有幻想，以為復興以後之日本，可成為貴國之與國，在東亞可作爲民主堡壘與安定力量，則吾人甚願揭破此幻想。日本在戰前與戰後，其本質並無變更。其當局除以種種欺騙手段，貌爲恭順，以博取貴國駐日人員之歡心外，根本無實行民主之決心。其舊日軍閥之潛伏勢力，依然存在。今若允其保持重工業機構，且予以重新武裝之機會，則一旦羽毛豐滿，珍珠港事件必將重演。貴國對於遠東局勢之觀察，有時不免隔閡。猶憶九一八事件發動以來，貴國對於中國人士屢次之呼籲，恒不加重視，乃致發生空前之橫禍。今日面臨危機之再起，吾人不得不對閣下盡其忠藎之霄，深望閣下加以採納。</p>
<p>欲謀世界之和平，必先安定東亞。欲謀東亞之安定，必須有獨立强大之中國。貴國遠識之士，皆抱此見解。不能因中國目前處境困難，而放棄此遠大方針。中國人民永遠愛好和平。中國正向民主方向前進。中國絕大多數之人民，願與美國爲友。惟有中國，可爲理想的安定東亞之力量，且不與美國之願望相違。吾人懇切希望貴國斷然放棄扶植日本之計劃。集中力量，以更多物資加速援華。使中國早日步入建設之途。吾人深信惟有中美兩國，切實互助，並聯合世界上其他民主國家，共同合作，始能奠定世界永久和平之基礎。</p>

<p>〔本報信陽卅一日電〕犯確山匪被擊退後，蔣總統卅一日特致電第五綏區張司令官稱：「決心堅强，指揮若定，無任欣慰，中正手啓」。又圍攻確山匪死傷千餘，士氣頽喪，傷兵怨聲載道，咸謂「戰要死，不戰也要死」。</p>

<h3 id="c19">最近教育動態雜評 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>聯合國文敎組織成立以後，特別注意受戰爭損害國家的教靑重建工作，因此對中國敎育現狀寄予很多的同情與重視。最近受「聯敎」委派來華調查敎育之奧勃萊先生，已在上海考察究畢赴首都，接着並將赴平，津，杭州，漢口，廣州各地，作詳細的調查與考察。我們於此，便容易聯想到我國各部門敎育的現狀，尤其如最近若干大學常有罷課等學潮，會給予同情我國的友邦敎育家以不良好的印象。可是我們却相信奧氏較久而較細密的觀察，能勿爲表象所囿，除都市之外，也要看看鄕村，除動態之外，也要考查靜態，尤其要體認中國敎育所受內在外在的各種阻難，而在艱苦中獲得的重建成績與進步。我們願借此機會，對當前國民敎育中等敎育和高等敎育某些動態，略作評述，以供商榷。</p>
<p>聯敎所注重的「基本敎育」，在中國最主要部分是國民敎育，在戰時與戰後三年中可說在貧窮與艱苦中而有穩健實在的進步。要感謝若干敎育專家的倡導，和無數國民學校敎師艱貞的努力，我們雖在抗戰中，而國民敎育在制度上實質上都有良好成績的表現。可是復員以後，國民敎育在公私交困的情形下，其進步大受經費艱難的限制。因此，政府撥付地方基本敎育經費八千億元，眞是當前敎育適應需要的一件要事。此費編列於國家總預算中，敎部在三月間才正式透露，至四月初並召開地方基敎座談會，主要議題就是此費分配原則，四月中敎育部長向國大報吿也鄭重提到，現在聞已照專家討論的原則開始分發各省市了。爲了配合行憲需要，符合聯敎致力的目標，這是極合理而且迫切需要的措施。我們希望此一宗款項的支配要採取重點主義，各省市當局對此次分配到的專款務須愼重運用，使其發生最大的成效。嚴格地說，此事只表示政府提倡示範之意，實際上國敎經費的增籌，更有賴於縣級財政切實負担，與社會力量的協力。在此戡亂未已國庫艱絀之中，政府如果無法負担敎育經費到憲法所定的比率，我們認爲祗有多多獎勵社會和私人資助。各省市縣當局務須密切注意圖敎經濟的艱苦，於善用此次基敎補助費之外，更應參據「國民敎育經費整理增籌辦法」，盡量增籌經費，藉以擴充基本敎育，來鞏固我們憲政的基礎。</p>
<p>中等敎育是承先啓後的一環。現在公私立的中校也一樣鬧窮，而復員後的中等敎育，無論在設備，師資，尤其學生程度方面，一般遠不及抗戰以前了。我們應多多同情中學敎帥，代他們呼籲减輕敎課負担，和增高俸薪待遇，——這正是爲專科以上學生打定良好基礎的大前提。至於從社會觀點看來，更迫切的一件事，是中等階段的職業敎育的重要性。</p>
<p>根據敎部三十五學年度的統計，全國中等學校五八九二所中，職業學校只有七二四校，祗佔總數約百分之十二，這比率實在太小了。觀於我們國民經濟的艱難，更爲一般靑年前途計，與其普通中學畢業後升學不得，謀職業反無專長，何如在入學前先事考慮擇業目標，作專業訓練的準備。况。國家各部門的建說事業，正需要中等職校所培成的中級幹部。教育部與各省縣廳局以後應多多扶植，添辦職校，增骰職科班級；而一般靑年與其家長也當改變觀念，正視現實，除確有志有力升學者外，應踴躍進入職校。我們相信而且切望聯敎會員國在此方面能予我們寳貴的指敎和助力。</p>
<p>談到當前高等敎育，我們可以節單的說：國家財政（亦即人民賦稅）對於敎育在此一部門負擔爲最大，而不幸若干大學所表現的情形却最爲動亂無度！此種動亂之最顯著的方式——罷課，當然大大損害了學生程度和學府聲譽。凡有心的大學敎授和大學生，對於這些事態所給予同胞（也即是間接負擔大學經費的人）的目象怎樣，其代表我國家敎育所予國際人士的觀感怎樣，應已至不堪言和不忍想的程度了！一年以來，高等敎育復員艱難之中，我們在報上所見到的最普遍的報導，竟是毀滅性的罷課。我們決不忽視靑年的時代苦悶，敎授的生活艱難，我們也聽到靑年學生所呼籲的各種理由；認爲應加合理的疏導與解決，可是我們眞懷疑：爲什麽罷課可爲少數人操持而爲多數大學師生所能容忍方式？自四月間北大和北平師院的學潮以後，五月中曾發生罷課的有中央大學，金陵，中正大學，湖南大學，中山大學理工院，四川大學，英士大學，至今日尚有朱能復課的。當奧勃萊氏考察京滬大學之中，他定會發見在學府內只有太放任的「自由」，太自由的言論，而將懷疑某些宣傳所謂「統制」靑年「迫害」靑年的究是什麼一回事。很多感情衝動的純潔學生，還多以政府或輿論指出共匪鼓動學潮而不信爲事實，我們姑不爲之剖解；我們只代表平正的輿論，重復申說：罷課「只是毀滅學生自已的學業，蔑視和否定敎授的精神生命，同時即窒息整個敎育的效用！」因此我們願分別誠懇的籲請（一）多數大學生「理知的自覺」。你們不滿現實和責難之情，始之以觀望，終之爲受暴力的控制。惟有多數人發揮其表示眞意見的勇氣，才能使少數人怯於生事妄爲，才能維持學業與名譽，否則將失盡社會的同情了。其次，（二）大學敎授必須重新運用其「科學的頭腦」，站出來聯起來表示主張，以維持講學自由與學府尊嚴。因爲由某些核心製造的當前學潮，決不是政府與「人民」的爭執，更非黨派之爭，而是科學與反科學，敎育與毀滅的角門！此外，我們更希望（三）敎育行政當局與治安當局在此時間，要負責，却更要愼重。敎育當局必要注重消弭疏導過於事後阻遏，誘掖純潔學生自覺過於懲處學生；而治安當局更須體察靑年心理，不宜慣用官廳口吻，更勿操切應付，在防範制止搗亂之中，要盡量避免刺激多數純潔學生的情感。今日國步多艱，被「迫害」的高等敎育正面臨危機，如何化險爲夷，以培護科學的進步，主要的還是「尙理知」的多數敎授和學生的責任。</p>

<p>〔本報天津五月卅一日電〕外滙結滙證書辦法公布後，津貿易界反應平淡。權威方而指出，現行貿易制度勢將全盤改革，始足配合此項辦法，進口分季核定辦法當不能繼續施行。各方咸認新辦法對吸收僑滙將有顯著成效。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕政府於三十日正式宣布改善外滙管理，採取結滙證明書辦法後，各方反應均極良好，中央社記者特分訪各界領袖人物，對此新措施之反響，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>中國進出口貿易協會常務理事張禹九稱：在新辦法之下，進口貨滙價提高，一則可以相當保護本國農工礦業，一則可以避免進口貨利潤過高之現象。惟推動出口，必須在新辦法之下，立即輔以各稱全國性之貸款方法，如押款，押滙，打包等等便利，方能收效。再結滙證明書應於結滙時同時發給，不宜等待裝船時方發。</p>
<p>中國蠶絲公司總經理謁敬中稱：生絲成本與國外價格，素來懸殊，惟新辦法公布後，若以綢貨推銷，則超於優利狀態，其利潤約爲二三成，再以綢製內衣等運銷海外，則獲利較豐，吾國織綢工業，應乘此時機，急起直追，努力改良品質，以適應國際市塲標準。</p>

<p>上海市進出口同業公會常務理事宋秉倫稱：，關於中央銀行此次採取結麗證明書辦法，本人認爲係一賢明之措施，其特點有二：（一）新辦法使出口商輸出所得之外滙，除照牌價結售於指定銀行外，其不足之差額，尙可在出售證明書時轉到補償，如是，出口貿易必大增。（二）僑滙可望增加，今後僑匯可不必再在黑滙中逃避，逐漸可使其納入正軌。</p>
<p>上海茶輸出業同業公會理事長唐季珊稱：推動出口，爭取外滙，政府素所重視，此次所頒佈採用結滙證明書，最爲澈底，足數政府對出口事業屬望之殷，吾人當善體斯意，努力推廣。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽五月廿六日航訊〕一九三一年的九一八事變，激動白山黑水間的抗日高潮。日寇陰謀佔領「南滿」，要開始向「北滿」進攻，急欲打通朝鮮東北之孔道，積極策劃修築吉（吉林）會（會寧）鐵路，當他的測量隊到達吉會路中段的豐聲褶子地方，被一個邊防軍的營長王德林全部予以消滅，日寇率陸空大軍進攻，相持三月之久，那是一九三一年十一月五日的故事，愛國英雄王德林的名字乃爲全國所熟知。那確是一個不平凡的故事。</p>
<p>王德林夫人</p>
<p>榮譽桂冠　地下長眠　一九三三年的三月，王德林，馬占山，李杜等抗日英雄在壯烈的鬥爭之後，不得不率部退入蘇聯，轉道返國。王德林將軍抱着復土的雄心流亡關內。一九三五年冬天，他跑到熱河，希望得到傅作義將軍的援助，重返東北組織抗日隊伍，未能如願。不幸於一九三七年的春天寂寞的病逝於魯南沂水軍次，那時他是光復軍總司令，沂水是他的故鄕，他在敵後組織了游擊部隊。</p>
<p>老將軍帶着他榮譽的桂冠安眠地下，他的家族，有五十二歲的王夫人和一個幼女却很黯淡的生活在西北一個荒僻角落裏，如不是他們不幸的遭遇，也許會終生默默無聞。</p>
<p>開過磨坊　供女求學　有一個偶然的機會，記者昨天見到流落東北兩年的王夫人，她含淚追述往事，痛苦的生活經驗使她那麽哀愁，但她對於王將軍的愛國和榮譽，永遠達到滿足。王夫人說：</p>
<p>「廿六年，我們在鄭州車站相見，他說：「你們去西安吧，我要去幹我的事了」。此後便沒有見面。他在前方的時候，寫信來常說他的錢可以够用，不問我們有沒有錢，我知道他很窮。……」</p>
<p>王將軍之死，對於王夫人的打擊是挺深重的，如流乾了眼淚，還得生活，撫育她的孩子她自己開了一個磨坊，給人家磨麵粉，送孩子入學校。生活是够苦的，給孩子理髮的錢都沒有，那時偶爾還有些王將軍的舊友給她們同情和援助。</p>
<p>勝利了，東北光復了，王夫人想到她的第二故鄉（吉林，延吉）還有薄田數畝可度餘年，便毅然帶着她的女兒劍虹小姐坐「行總」的難民船駛來東北，她一脚踏上東北的土地，才知道做了一個好夢。故鄉回不去，她舉目無親，只好母女倆人在行總東北分署的難民工廠中做工，而以後不得不去投靠鐵西的難民收容所。在南京自殺的國大代表孔憲榮，是和王德林將軍同舉義旗的同志，如弟兄一般，孔將軍生前雖然無力供給她們的生活，精神上總還獲得不少安慰，孔將軍死後，她們的生活更覺凄寂。</p>
<p>為了孩子不忍投水　王夫人說到傷心處，說：「我看準了去鐵西區的大橋底下的一窪水，但是創紅這孩子老跟在我的身邊，我要跳下去，她跟下去怎麽辦呢？她還年靑！她還該有她的前途」。</p>
<p>日前母女上書蔣夫人，希望夫人能哀憐她們的流落。王夫人說：政府能予以救濟，維持最低生活，就感恩不盡。她對於女兒的前途，則期望甚殷，希望能准她的女兒入抗戰將士遺族學校讀書。這位小姐早失去求學的機會，不得不在某機關的合作社爽做點小事，依然不够維持生活，母親在她很小的時候抱她從日寇的砲火下逃生，後來開磨房，供她訊書，這些深刻的印象，常使他感恩地流淚。</p>
<p>此間社會人士對王德林將軍的遺族極表關心，衛立煌夫人韓權華女士曾詢問她們的生活，並聞目下頗有送她們到南京之意。</p>
<p>孔憲榮氏　遺族生活　孔憲榮夫人及其幼子今後的生活，亦殊堪焦慮。最近母子由長春來瀋，飛機票錢，槪由長春各界捐助。孔夫人說：「憲榮的總隊繼續憲榮的事業，在我是一種很大的精神安慰。」孔氏的舊部，即由其多年的戰友郞雲鵬招撫。郞氏說：「說孔先生爲了某種原因自殺，是侮辱，他的死，確是由於憂國憤世，是一種尸諫，我們應該瞭解他，學習他，繼承他偉大的精神，爲國家為東北而奮鬥！」</p>

<p>〔中央社漢城卅一日電〕五月十日在聯合國主持下，而在蘇聯抵制下所選出之第一屆朝鮮國會，已於三十一日下午二時開幕，以爲朝鮮獨立與統一開路。代表朝鮮人口三分之二之南韓一百五十七選區之代表二百人，將開會進行下列三項工作：（一）制定朝鮮政府依之成立及總統依之選出之憲法；（二）謀求統一美軍佔領下之南韓與蘇軍佔領下之北韓之方法；（三）解決人民艱苦之經濟問題。另有一百席缺額，留爲共產黨之北韓之代表，但彼等不致參加。按蘇聯竹拒絕聯合國赴韓代表團進入北韓，主持全國選舉事宜。此次國會之臨時主席，將由韓國獨立促進黨領袖七十四歲之李承晚博士擔任，議負中八十五名爲無黨派者，五十四名屬韓國獨立促進黨，卅名屬韓國民主黨，其主席爲親日之金性洙，十一名屬聯合靑年黨，中有多數所謂獨立人士，冬與韓民主黨有聯繫。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城卅一日電〕朝鮮議會於五月十日聯合國主持之大選中產生後，於卅一日舉行首次會議。高齡七十有三之反共政洽領袖李承晚當選議長，當即欣然聲稱：「朝鮮共和國再度誕生了。」李氏之獲選過程僅費時九十分鐘，渠乃發表接受演說稱，議會即將產生之政府，將享有全部朝鮮之主權，目前蘇聯所佔據之北韓亦包括在內。李氏乃列舉其施政綱要：第一，韓人在組成軍隊力能自衛前，美軍應繼續留駐。即使在美軍撤退後，美國技術人員亦應留駐顧問，特別是經濟方面。李氏稱：韓政府將企圖「與蘇聯直接作友善性談判以公允解決兩國間之公共問題」。渠將韓共現有「一最後機會可以悔悟來歸。若然，吾人將忘懷前事，過往不究」。否則，韓共將「依法受嚴厲之制裁，任何外國勢力均不足以協助彼等」。（此言顯對聯合國朝鮮委員會而發，該會曾壓迫美韓兩方釋放政治犯三千八。）李承晚保證根絕貪汚，肅淸政府中人投機，加速組織國防軍，管制物價，及立法保陣出版言論及集會自由。渠又稱：「雖因國際時局，美軍仍將留駐若千時日，然朝鮮政府一旦正式要求其撤退，美軍將立即返國。吾人應明瞭此點，即勝利軍隊之留駐，將不干涉吾人之主權。」南韓美軍司令霍奇中將及軍事總督第恩少將，均答似美國絕不强迫議會，而願應邀在各方面協助。權力之交替將逐漸展開，根據目前計劃，美軍不擬撤退。聯合國委員會在此間素來不受重視，以其代表多在上海起草報吿書，故僅派中法兩國佐理代表出席，韓人大感不滿。該會威望又遇打擊。議會開會尙祗半小時，警察因有六批人士散發傳單揚動旗幟反對議會而捕去其二十一人。</p>

<p>〔路透社紐約三十日電〕前國務卿貝爾納斯今日在南卡羅林那州洛克希爾城之溫斯魯浦學院畢業典禮中致辭，認爲美國應該願意與蘇聯討論並不牽涉其他盟國政府之一切問題。同時美國應繼續進行其充實國防之計劃。渠認美國應勿忘古印第安首長所稱「我被欺騙一次，這是你的恥辱，被欺騙二次，這是我的恥辱」之語。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯顯然較馬歇爾爲重視蘇聯最近發動的和平攻勢，他說：「余始終相信蘇聯於實施其擴張政策之際，將一直擴張至民主國家所能允許的界限。當蘇聯認識不經戰爭不能繼續向前推進時，相信其必能放棄其神經戰而覓取解決辦法。蘇聯今日當已認淸吾人並無不經一嚇的神經，反之，吾人具有實力，並且準備使用此等實力，以維護吾人之自由，同時並經由聯合國機構以維護其他具有抵抗侵略的勇氣之自由民族之自由。」貝爾納斯並譴責史達林總理，以政府首長之尊，不應公開答復美第三黨領袖華萊士，而當直接致虛美國總統。貝氏又曰，最重要者不在致富之對象。而在渠之表示願意解決岐見是否具有誠意。美國政府隨時應準備與蘇聯政府討論有關兩國政府之問題，至於有關其他盟國政府之問題，須利用聯合國作爲主持談判之工具。</p>

<h3 id="c61">英國工業博覽會 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— （本報駐英記者薩本耿）</p>
<p>（倫敦通訊）一九四八年的英國工業博覽會於五會月三日起舉行至同月十四日閉幕。此一博覽，如果追究它的歷史，那麽第一次是舉行於一九一五年，它的性質是一種有組織的將全國主要產品作一展覽，含有鼓勵與促進商業的意義。第一次這個博覽會在倫敦一地舉行，參加展覽者五百九十一家，佔地面積八萬八千七百十四平方呎，由英國政府之海外貿易部主持，我們由其主持的機關名稱，就可以想像到這不僅是對內的，並且還是對外的。</p>
<p>到了一九二〇年，伯明罕總商會也組織了一個重工業展覽會，成爲「英國工業博覽會」之機械部份。從這一年起，每年博覽會就分做伯明罕與倫敦兩地舉行。前者或者可以說是偏重機械金屬鐵器方面，由該地總商會主持，但受政府的支持。後者則偏於輕工業方面而直接政府辦理由以前由海外貿易部，現在則改由貿易局出口推廣部負責，這是英國政府中很重要的一個行政單位，貿易局局長是內閣閣員之一。一九二〇年伯明罕與倫敦兩地　次同時舉行博覽會時，參加的單位爲一千六百八十九個，佔地卅一萬五千零八十八平方呎。一九三九年參加的單位達二千三百卅八，佔地達八十二萬六千四百卅三平方呎。</p>
<p>這種博覽會，由歷次情形看來，具有兩個特點，其一，是帶有國家性質的，所有東西必須是英國本地或大英帝國的任一部份的出產才能參加。其二，除了紡織以外，必須是貨物之實際生產者才能參加。前者的原因，大約爲了這是推銷國貨的博覽會，後者或許是爲了便利貿易。紡織之所以除外者，大約是爲紡織本身包括有若干獨立的製造過程。而不易判定其誰爲實際生產者。</p>
<p>本年的博覽會，仍分別在倫敦與伯明罕兩地舉行，據估計，參加者達三千單位以上，如果環繞所有的博覽櫃台一周，等於走廿五英里的路程。事先，柬請世界各國的商人前來參觀，據最近發表的數字，這一次外商由一〇八不同的地點，前來參觀的約有一萬五千人。伯明罕部份是人人隨時可去，倫敦部份祗有三天是普通人可以參觀。參觀者每人須買門票，自然的，一票一人一次，但商人可以憑請柬或其他證明購買一種證章，憑證可以隨時出入會塲。</p>
<p>展覽的內容，可以分兩部份。倫敦部份又分做兩個地點舉行，〔不過在這兩個地點之間，除了經常的交通工具之外，另有專車免費接送）所展覽的包括化學藥品·光學與照器器材·運動器具·印刷機器，樂器·無綫電·文具·兒童玩具·首飾鐘表·皮革·毛織品衣料·傢具等等。伯明罕則注重電器機械之類。伯明罕原爲英工業中心之一，離倫敦一百十三英里。</p>
<p>這個博覽會是帶有廣吿性質的，由於英國入超問題之嚴重，所以它的意義更爲重要。作爲一們中國人，在我們看了這個會之後，我想有一點是應該在這裏提出來的，就是我們參觀者在這個會裏，看到了若干在英國內市塲根本看不到的東西，換言之，他們眞是束緊腰帶，把好東西完全拿來做生意。（一九四八年五月十六日）</p>

<h3 id="c62">越海捕魚受吾痛懲　開砲轟沉日逃船　軍法官夜審漁夫　海軍中建艦艦長追述發現追緝經過 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕五月二十九日天未明時，我海軍中建艦在長江口外余山（即沙尾山）附近海面截獲之日本捕魚船一艘，已於昨日由中建軍艦押解抵滬，停泊高昌廟江面。該捕魚船船名並非「靖仙丸」，而係「雲仙丸」第二廿二　，重九十九　　　　　　人　　　　　　　　魚八百餘箱。除雲仙丸二十二號外，中建艦是夜並擊沉另一日本漁船重九九·八一噸之雲仙丸二十一號，該船上船員除一人跳海下落不明外，其餘十二人經中建艦放救生艇救起後，亦於昨日一併押解來滬，故共計有　漁夫二十五名，昨日下午解送至海軍第一軍區司令部，由軍法官李有鑑漏夜審訊，一面呈報南京海軍總司令部轉呈國防部請示處置辦法。因最近日本漁船侵入我領海事迭有所聞，此次人證　證、獲、恐將引起國際間一番交涉矣。</p>
<p>中建艦爲大國所贈　　　　，　四千　　，現供海軍訓練之用，此次自靑島海軍軍官學校學員四十一人來滬。二十八日中午在途中接總司令部電令，囑順便堵截侵入我國領海之四艘日本漁船。據艦長林傅及副艦長陳東海追述經過情形稱：該艦奉令後，仍沿原來航綫前進，二十九日晨二時三十分，抵佘山西北約九十八海哩處，果在航向右端約一海哩處發現兩日本漁船，船上有燈火，正在收起漁網。中建艦乃停車囑該兩漁船靠攏，然對方置之不答，一面繼續收網，一面滅燈，旋即散開，一向中建艦頭部，一向中建艦尾部分頭逃逸。中建艦乃即集中火力向前一艘開砲射擊，該漁船雖被擊中數彈，仍負創向淺水處急駛，追逐約西十餘分鐘後，因水愈淺，乃予放棄，另一艘亦已不知去向，中建艦乃仍偱航綫行駛，三刻鐘後，在佘山西北九十海哩處又發現另外兩魄日本漁船，即爲雲仙丸二十一號及二十二號。</p>
<p>預先警戒·待旦而捕中建艦鑑於前兩艘之逃逸，此次乃滅燈後　中迫近，一面並預先警戒，迨接近時，此兩艘漁輪尙在散網，但因時値黑夜，爲恐發生意外，乃先繞該兩漁船而行，擬待天明後再放小艇下海捕捉。不料約一小時後該兩漁船互通燈號後又分向而逃，中建艦因早有警戒，睹狀乃即開砲射擊，當將第二十一號漁船擊沉，第二十二號漁船至此遂亦不敢再逃，中建艦乃放下救生艇，將日本艦夫押救登艦，時爲二十九日淸晨四時二十分左右。</p>
<p>中建艦長指出股逃之兩艘漁船發現時之位置，係在北緯三十三度，東經一百二十一度五十分，截獲之兩艘漁船位置係在北緯三十二度五十二分，東經一百二十二度，均在中建艦自靑島來滬之航綫右方，故絕對爲我國領海。</p>
<p>可能均爲軍人化身</p>
<p>記者昨在中建艦上見到兩漁船之船長中野龜司，下村和中及其他船夫。彼等身穿舊軍服，以前可能均係海軍軍人，因在其中曾搜出穿海軍制服之照片，另有人佩有七七事變之圓形紀念章，上刻「日支事變紀念，一九三七石黑隊」字樣。彼等身上雖未搜出武器，但據我海軍人員推測可能已擲諸海中。據兩船長中野龜司及下村和中供稱，兩艘漁船係日本川南水產工業株式會社所有，五月十六日自長崎出港，共有二十艘。彼等因在本海捕魚無着，故逐漸馳來中國海岸。詢以是否懂得不應侵入中國領海，兩人承認理屈，並稱不懂國際公法，又稱日本北海道漁區因懼怕俄國人，故不敢去捕魚云。</p>
<p>妥爲看管　剃髪防逃</p>
<p>所有受逮之日本船夫姓名如下：二十一號雲仙丸下村和中·中村中康。飯田茂·小川滿男·岡本晴夫·新道鐵土助，兼種一·山下廣喜·川口忠男·石谷增吉·勝尾·櫻井。二十二號雲仙丸中野龜司·松尾末吉·小田孝·川崎芳久·荒本弘幸·中村藤男·松尾·中野實·西島廣作·大隈英敏·熊浦敏·小口字衛次。岸本彌一。其中除一人跳海時受輕傷，一人患病外，其餘均妥爲優待看管，僅在各人頭頂正中剃去若干頭髮，以資職別，而防其潛逃云。</p>

<h3 id="c63">本月配米價　每斗五十萬　較市價低百分十五　任顯羣表示非久計 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市六月份食米配售價格，業經當局決定，爲每人每斗五十萬元。吳市長於昨午五時，在市府邀集糧食部代表葉實夫，行政院處理美國救濟物資委員會代表潘光迥，民食調配委員會主委任顯羣等，舉行第四次上海市配售糧食議價委員會。討論時認爲五月份下半月米價並不正常，經討論結果，決照最低可能之解釋，核定六月份配售米價爲每斗五十萬元，並即以長途電話與南京院委會方面交換意見</p>
<p>據民食調配委員會任主　昨向記者表示：渠對昨日核定之六月份配米新價，似甚表滿意。渠認爲從昨日之三人會議中發現，中美雙方尙能衷誠合作。按照規定配價不得低於市價百分之五，而六月份新價業已較市價低百分之十五左右。</p>
<p>勉抑米價　可能影響產量</p>
<p>惟任主委認爲將配售米價勉予抑低，並非良好現象，因可能影響生產量，蓋目今米價漲度不及其他物價，過分抑低，農民對種米之興趣必致　低，故實非永久之計。此種政策，亦爲目光遠大者所不取。任主委表示：美國政府六月份後仍將　續以食米援華，實係目前之最佳消息，因下月起，國米供應困難，幾需全靠美米援助矣。</p>
<p>美米援華　延長半年</p>
<p>據確悉：美國物資救濟委員會內部決定，食米援華決延長半年結束，至本年十二月爲止。美國政府並已先撥一千二百萬美元，在東南亞暹羅緬甸等地先行盡速採購，計可購米七萬五千噸，故本市七月份計口配米，仍可繼續辦。</p>
<p>油價</p>
<p>又本月份配油價格，亦經決定，爲豆油菜油麻油，每人十二兩，九萬三千元。生汕十萬八千元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕五月份生活指數，目昨日發表外，市總工會連續接得公用事業，棉紡業等產業工會電話，對五月份工人指數表示不滿，以爲三十三萬七千倍之指數，較上月僅增加百分之二十九，而物價在此一月中，展開所謂「五月漲風」，其上漲指數，雖無官方統計，然遠超過百分之二十九之比率，則任何人均能有此直覺。市總工會負責人，於接得電話後，對工人生活指數逐日低落原因，作非正式之討論，認爲在工人指數中所佔百分率較高之食米一項（七斗五升），自全市實行計口授米後，即依配給價計算，是爲工人指數低落之主要原因，雖職員指數中之食米亦同樣按配給價計算，但其所佔百分率則較工人指數中爲輕，同時職員指數中列有綢緞，呢絨，電影，水　等項目，而工人指數中皆付缺如，但實際上電影，水菓，綢緞等物，在工人生活上，亦均屬必需，故成認今後指數編算之方法，實有從新考慮之必要。</p>

<h3 id="c85">當日支票不能抵用　銀錢業僅起實行　但經收妥或照票無訛者不受限制 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於銀行客戶存人他行票據，在未經收兌以前，不得抵用一案，已決定於一日實施。上海金管局負責人頃再說明如次：此案早在去夏財政部即已通飭施行，此項措施，實係鑒於若干客戶於本身未有的欲之前，遽先開出支票，其結果不僅膨脹信用，增加流通速率，抑且增加退票數字，引起金融市塲之不安，故不得不有所限制。惟以坁用辦法，相沿已久，一旦取消，自難免不便，故爲顧全事實起見，曾應銀錢業及工商界之請求，一再延長其實施期間，並訂定通融辦法。近日各界對此多表關切，爰再解釋數點：</p>
<p>一，票據當日不得抵用，僅指支票而言。其餘本票保付支票曁合法滙票，均不在此限制範圍以內。</p>
<p>二，即以支票而論，亦非當日支票一律不能抵用。其經收妥或經照票無訛者，自仍得以隨時抵用。故其問題厥在「收兌」與否，而不在是否「當日」。</p>
<p>三，最近中國工業協會及工業同業公會推派代表來局，要求對於票據抵用限制酌予放寬，本局曾允，凡經治得銀錢行莊同意，訂立抵用契約者，所開支票，在約定有效限期限額以內，仍得抵用。</p>
<p>四，預料票據不抵用辦法實施初一二日內，退票數字或將較增，但此係一時現象，過後即可减少。本局並已予密切注意防範，深盼工商界對於所開出之支票特別愼重。最好先向行莊保付或洽妥後，再行發出，以免退票。</p>

<p>晨初人心即因種種不良影響而見疲，永紗開二六五〇元低盤，開後成交毫無，賣到二六〇〇元關。經六九號等維持，始見回漲到二六七五元，無奈人心已去，在二六〇〇元關口掙扎。代辦費開高爲三二元及三六元，復經一六〇號等賣到二五三〇元，一九七號等尙納，升爲二五五五元。近午再跌至二五二〇元低價，午收爲二五三〇元。較上週六計華豐跌成半，景綸中法華新景福新光勤興中泥新華各降一成，永紗美亞信和榮豐火柴商務各跌半成，中絲小升，餘均小挫。</p>
<p>後市永紗上塲二五六元，賣到二五五〇元，一九七號等進至二六〇五元，中絲華豐新光等逐步回挺，尤以中絲更俏。一一七號等了結，先傳國行呈差進二萬八千多億，而退至二五七〇元以下。但國行實僅差進一萬餘億，二一八號等進至二六〇五元結束。較晨收計中法景福新光火柴中絲新華升半成，統益內衣尙平，餘均微漲，塲外各股榮辱不一。</p>

<p>又紗管會頃以近日外界對該會之標售棉花事有所指摘，頃接該會負責人聲明稱：標售棉花，係爲配合央行之緊縮銀根而起。因緊縮銀根，係一全面性之政策，因如拋售其他物資，缺少棉花，則花價必因而上漲，紗管會此一舉動，乃因央行與之商酌後而行者。况標售價格，係較市價爲低，即此已可證明無甚利潤。至外稱之停止標售事，亦不正確。因央行最近複又商酌再行標售，其數量約在六七千担左右，一俟此數標出後，當即停止云。</p>

<p>雜糧　市勢軟衆，因票據不能抵用，人心不安定，致買賣均寂，交易遲遲未能開出。後市稍有做開，大致言明隔日本票，黃豆高貨平定，漢口乍豆次貨三百十二萬，高貨站三百三十萬，寗波白蠶新貨昨首朝上市，價三百六十萬，新元麥到多下降二十萬元，苞米北帮不納，降二十萬。菉豆交寂，紅糧削五萬，芝蔴疲挫，生仁平定，僅開秦皇島生仁一千三百萬原價。</p>

<p>自中央銀行總裁兪鴻鈞氏於前日宣佈進出口結滙新辦法後，外滙基金平衡委員會昨晨曾舉行緊急會議，到主委陳光甫，委員劉攻　沈熙瑞等多人，輸管會主委霍寳樹亦列席參加。商討今後之外滙平衡工作，如何配合此一新結滙辦法。今後外滙平衡工作，其重心將自過去之調整滙率而變更至平衡外滙頭寸之收支。蓋主管當局認爲如外滙頭寸之收支能趨於平衡，則對新政策之推行，當裨益甚大。至輸出人管理政策，聞亦將有所變更。是項新政策可能係將現行之管制尺度稍予放寬。州一般估計，此項放寬，短期內恐尙難付諸實施。蓋有關當局，尙須於此若干時日中，對新政策之成效，加以適當之檢討後，始能有所決定也。輸管會主委霍寳樹氏，昨日於答復記者關於轍管政策之詢問時，亦僅謂對已公佈之五六兩季限額，輸管會不擬有所改變。唯另自可靠方而傳出之消息，則謂輸管會對改變現行管制政策之方案，確已在擬訂中。</p>

<h3 id="c131">關於「讀經示要」 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 熊十力</p>
<p>編者按：熊十力先生「讀經示要」一書，刊於內地，沿海人士，多不能得。是害爲我國思想界上之一鉅著，不應忽視。此文爲熊先　致讀者函，　　是書吃緊處，頗重要。茲得熊光生允許，特披露如次。</p>
<p>示要一書，不僅解決讀經問題，而實於秦漢以來，二三千年間，爲學術思想界闢一新路向。惜乎衰亡之世，士人習於浮淺混亂，無足語斯事者。</p>
<p>第一講，首釋道，固是新論本旨。宗三於此中，印化之失也鬼，西化之失也物，最感痛快。</p>
<p>次言治化九義，序云，順常道而起治化，此句吃緊。經言治化，確是本於常道。此九義宏廓深遠，法治之組織與功能，實亦攝於德治或禮治之中。九義中於此等處極圓融，非若前儒迂談王霸之辨也。</p>
<p>世儒好言禮樂，而實不知禮樂。九義中，言禮樂最好。序與和，發揮甚深遠。禮主讓，與今之西化似不相融，吾皆抉其根據。一從科學上互助論，一從哲學上生命論之全體性爲根據，三從民治之精神，亦在乎讓。理論與事實，面面均到。</p>
<p>西人言治，從欲上立基，經學言治術，則從性，上立基。此皆見底之言，不易之論。</p>
<p>性與情之辨，前儒都欠淸楚。九義中劈得極積極細，非字字反身體之，則且作文字看過去，哀哉。</p>
<p>人道有窮，而願欲無窮。斯義廣大精微極矣。九義中，談至此，文字亦浩浩無涯。</p>
<p>取大學之三綱八目爲六經與儒學之總匯與要領，細思之，愈覺有味。天人之故，實備於斯，粗心淺解人，自不悟耳。明德宗陽明，確不可易。誠意，則余之新解，正宋明諸師之誤。格物從朱，最有深意。結以儒行，而經之爲經，義無不備。總之，皆常道也，皆不可易也。</p>
<p>第二講，首辨志，確是精要至極，惜乎今人不堪語此，繼砭名，而申之以三畏，字字皆聖賢血脈。今之學者，如終不悟，萬世爲奴而已，可與爲學乎？</p>
<p>講西學，而不能廢經，其間有三義，皆閎大眞切，不可忽也。中國之衰在一統。中國人非弱於科學思想者，亦非無民治思想者，惜乎秦以後之環境囿之耳。近人徒據宋明學，而謂中西文化絕對分途，讀示要第二講，而後知其不必然也。</p>
<p>評老莊處，字字金言，不可忽略。二千餘年來，國人失其剛健創進之活氣，老莊與佛誤之也。此可不深究乎？</p>
<p>評佛之幾段文字，字字金言。二千年來，佛敎徒固見不及此，反佛者全不究佛學，又如何道得半字。佛與道，談本體，總溺於虛寂，而吾儒大易之道，未嘗不虛寂，却要見到本體原來剛健。剛健即無一切染着，無一毫沾滯，未嘗不虛寂也。新論中卷功能章，已盛發此義，吾子作評時，未及此耳。示要中，於此等處，時言及之，都精要，不可忽。</p>
<p>剛健故變動不居，故生生不息。儒家哲學本可融攝西洋，而又逈異西洋者，則西洋人少反已工夫，未見到虛寂耳，徒務知　而少在生活上着力耳</p>
<p>評老佛處，是中國二三千年來學術思想的核心問題所在，不可忽。漢宋之辨，吾子旣同情矣，可不再提。</p>
<p>第三講，說易處，仍依新論。其發揮剛健與生生意思，及明宇宙開闢，不得謂無機物時代無有心靈，只是穩而未顯耳。乾卦中，釋自强不息處，與第二講中，評莊子處，互相照應，此皆不可忽。說易中，凡言治化，並注重人各自治自主，而亦互不相害。世界終歸自毀，則亦已耳，如其不然，則此義焉可反對？近世重集團，而太損及個人，將人變成機械，此眞人道之憂也。吾經學可以救人類者，正在此耳。</p>
<p>講春秋，變而不失其常。此義最宜會通看去。康有爲之徒，只以抄書之辦法，拾取字面作話頭而已，何曾知得三世義乎？昔者張孟劬先生最鄙視有爲，誠具法眼哉！</p>
<p>講尙書，字不多，而義實深宏。據論孟左傳中庸，尋出二帝三王執中心法之傳，以見道統治統所自，絕無附會，於是乎書之爲經而非史也，可知矣。講詩經處，一據孔子之言。而儒者人生思想，於是可見。後代詩文家鮮有通經者。</p>
<p>講三禮處，最有深意。須發揮　理，以救知有家屬而不知有社會之流弊。然禮之根本義，見於禮記者甚精要，須吾自抉擇一番方好。世亂方殷，而老懷愁慘，量論未能作，又何堪及此乎？</p>
<p>講周禮處，亦有遠旨，吾提其綱，而詳闡則有待於後之人耳</p>
<h3 id="c132">湖上閒思錄　（一） <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 孤鷗</p>
<p>人文與自然</p>
<p>宇宙之大，只須稍讀幾本近代天文學的書，便不難想像。當你在夜間仰視天空，雖見萬千星座，密布四圍。但那些星與星間距離之遼闊，是够可驚人的。羣星之在太空，恰應似大海上幾點帆船。或幾隻鷗鳥，我們儘可說，宇宙間是虛無遠超渦了眞實。雖則那些星羣，光芒四射，燦爛耀人，但你也可想到，宇宙間是黑暗遠超過了光明。</p>
<p>在宇宙間有太陽，在太陽糸裏有地球，在地球上萬物中有了生命，在生命裏有人類，人類在整個宇宙間的地位，實在太渺小了。譬如在大黑深夜，無邊的曠野裏有著一點微光，最多只照見了他近旁尺寸之地，稍遠則全是漆黑，全是不可知。人類生命歷程中所發出的這一點微光，譬　得更恰當些，應該如螢火，螢雖飛著前進，他的光則照耀在後面尾梢頭。人類的知識，也只能知道已然的，憑此星一些對於已然的知識與記憶，來奔向前程，奔向此無窮不可知之將來。</p>
<p>你若太過注意到自然界去，正如行人在大黑深夜的曠野裏，老把眼睛張望到無邊的深黑中去，將會使你恐怖，使你惶惑。但有些人太過看重你個人的生命，當知個人的生命依然是一個自然，一樣的虛空勝過眞實，黑暗勝過光明，一樣在無邊深黑中，人類的心智，偏要在虛空中覓眞實，黑暗中尋光明，那只有在人類大羣已往歷史文化的累積裏面去尋覓。這些經人類大羣已往歷史所累積）者的文化遺產，我們稱之曰人文，用來與自然對立。這是眞實的，光明的，但這些也只是螢尾梢頭的一點微光。人類已往生活中所積累的一些歷史文化遺產，如何得與整個大自然界長宙廣宇相抗衡，相並立。但就人而論，也只有這樣，這所謂人本位的意見。在中國傳統見解裏自然界稱爲天，人文界稱爲人，中國人一面用人文來對抗天然，高抬人文來和天然並立，但一面却主張天人合一，仍要雙方調和融通，旣不談自然來吞滅人文，也不想用人文來戰勝自然。</p>
<p>道家也有天人不相勝的理論，（見莊子）但道家太看輕歷史文化的羣業，一個個的個人，只能說他天的分數多，人的分數少，一面是　乎大哉，另一面又是眇乎小哉，如何能天人不相勝呢。所以荀子要說莊子知　天而不知人。但荀所主張人類性惡，這也沒有眞認識人類歷史文化羣業的眞相。你若一個一個人分析而看，則人類確自有種種缺點，種種罪惡。因爲一個個的人，也不過是自然的一部分而已。但你若會通人類大羣歷史文化之總體而觀，則人世間一切的善，何一非人類羣業之所造，又如何說人性是惡呢？西方耶敎思想，正爲也單注意在一個個的個人身上，沒有把眼光注射到大羣歷史文化之積業上去，因此也要主張人類性惡，說人生與罪惡俱來，如此則終不免要抹殺人生復歸自然。佛敎也有同樣傾向，要之不看重歷史文化之大羣業，則勢必要對人生發生悲觀，他們只歷指一個個個人生活來立論，他們却不肯轉移目光，在大羣歷史文化的無限積業上着想。近世西方思想，由他們中世紀的耶敎敎義中解放，重新回復到古代的希臘觀念，一面積極肯定人生，但一面還是太重視個人，結果人文學趕不上自然學，惟物的思想泛濫橫溢，有心人依然要回頭乞靈於中世紀的宗敎，來補救目前的病痛。就人事論人事，此後的出路，恐只有冲淡個人主義，轉換到歷史文化的大共業上，來重提中國傳統天人平衡天人合一的老觀念。</p>
<h3 id="c133">亞里士多德論　個物與實在 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 一指</p>
<p>柏拉圖把理型（Ideas）視爲眞的，把事物視爲幻的，—在他眼裏，理型是實在（Reality），事物是幻相。亞裏士多德旣然不贊成理型與事物分立，旣然主張槪念即在事物中求得，所以他心目中的存在就是事物（統稱曰事物，單　呌個物）。不過他所謂個物包含兩方面：（一）概念，（二）物質·槪念他呌做形式（form），物質他呌做質料（matter），這兩部分在個物上有即即不離的關係。</p>
<p>個物是一切學問的對象。大致上說，所有學問都要求形式，科學上的原理與公例是科學所求的形式，哲學上的概念與範疇是哲學所求的形式。只是各門學問所求的形式有距離質料較近和較遠的不同。例如物理，化學，離質料近些，數學離質料遠些，哲學離質料更遠些。有人以有哲學太玄虛，不切實際，其實他們所謂玄虛，所謂不切實際，就是因爲哲學所求的形式離質料比較遠些。殊不知世上一切學問所努力的都在於求形式，只要直接或間接根據質料，不是憑空臆造，就可以了。哲學上的形式就是間接根據質料所求得的，我們不能責備它，——這是一層。並且人類的文化愈進步，一切學問愈向抽象方面走，是，一切學問所求的形式離質料愈遠。現在最發達的科舉—如天文，物理—用數學用得那么多，和數學一天接近一天，這就是一個好證據。攸如嫌哲學玄虛，爲什麽不進一步嫌數學玄虛，再進一步嫌天文，物理玄虛？推到極端，必至嫌一切學問玄虛，而反於初民無識無知的境界，這有什么好處？這是另一層。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c134">美國敎育哲學上的爭論 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>近來年美國敎育界對於敎育哲學或敎育理想發生了一種爭論。這種爭論不純粹是抽象的，理論的，而是和實踐有關係，是他們想對當前的敎育方針立即有所改革的。所以在爭論裏面的各種不同主張，都不是空中樓閣，都是多少已見　實踐的。作者認爲這種爭論有我們加以注意的必要，因把這種爭論的內容簡略報吿如下。</p>
<p>從這種爭論裏，我們可以看到美國敎育思潮的三大派。這三大派是：一爲「百本名著課程派，以芝加哥大學的校長休秦斯（Hutchms）爲代表，二爲實騐方法派，以紐約大學敎授福克（Sidney　Hook）所著「現代人的敎育」（Educatnio　for　Modern　Man）爲代表，三爲折衷派，以哈佛大學的報吿名爲「自由社會中的普通敎育」（Generai　Education　in　a　Free　Society）爲代表。第一派稍爲守舊，第二派稍爲趨新，而第三派則思折衷於新舊之間</p>
<p>根據第一派的敎育理想，認爲人類的根本天性是知道的。由所知的人類天性，即可推論人類所需要的敎育。次則，人類特徵，雖依時依地而略有不同，然其根本天性則是不變的。因而我們可從人類歷史上發現一種類型。運用這種類型，可帮助我們明瞭現在而指示將來。蓋人們所保持的價値是有永恒而客觀的存在的。這些價値則含藏於過去許多名人著作中而遺留給我們，我們只要讀這些名人的著作，便可理解而接受這些絕對價値和眞理，以作我們信仰和行爲的唯一可靠的指示。所以這一派主張大學課程，可以一百本名著爲限。美國聖約翰學院已照這種計劃實行了。</p>
<p>第二派的敎育理想是反對第一派的。這一派認爲前一派的主張過於偏市傳統，偏重權威。蓋人類不生存於眞空，而生存於環境中。至人和環境間的關係，則是可以改變的。這些關係依時依地而不同，所以過去問題的答案不一定對於現在是正確。人類必須運用智力去解決他們的問題。過去問題的答案，以及傳統的價値，只是人類解決問題時所須注意的一組因素。應付問題的方法當爲科學的，實騐的。敎育當以訓練學生遝用這種方法爲主要，却沒有單一的課程內容可以學習。依賴這種實騐的方法才是民主政治的特徵</p>
<p>第三派則折衷於前兩派之間，思找出一條中間的道路的。這一派不像第一派，不主張有所謂不變的人類根本天性，然却思尋覓多少人類共同的信仰以爲敎育方針的根據。這一派認爲在西方文化的傳統中可以找得多少共同的根據，而在這種傳統中又包含有需要變化的信仰。一方面有不變者在，另一方面也有應變者在；一方面當有同，另一方面也當有異。所以這一派主張大學課程，是可以一方而供給共同的核心，另一方面又可供給學生不同的需要。我們當訓練學生有區別價値的能力，却不必以某某價値强迫學生接受、</p>
<p>以上三派思想之爭，究竟那一派才算正確，這是作者這裘不必代爲決定的。作者所可提示的一點是，像美國這種爭論在我國早就有過的。第一派可以說是讀經派，第二派是新文化派，而第三派也是折衷派。現在我們雖不大討論這些問題，而這些問題却仍是存在的。重行討論這些問題，也許是時候了。</p>

<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>翁文灝論美蘇政治思想</p>
<p>新任行政院院長翁詠霓先生近在思想與時代月刋發表論文，題爲「美國及蘇聯兩種政治思想的衝突」，指示中國建國大計應走的方向，特爲簡錄以餉讀者。（原文載於該刋第五十二期，定價每册五萬元，購者可逕函杭州國立浙江大學轉該社）</p>
<p>政治制度導源於政治思想，思想不同，制度也因之而改變。不幸的是，在此次世界大戰之後，兩種根本不同的思想正在衝擊爭鬥，目前是一個「兩大相持」的局面，流波所激，中國自然受其　脅。</p>
<p>美國的思想實在導源於歐洲，譬如英法瑞比荷意等國都在其中。就是納粹黨未當權以前的德國，未受蘇聯控制以前的捷克，正在努力支持的瑞典丹麥等國，也都在同一規轍中。現爲措辭簡化起見，以美國作爲代名。</p>
<p>在這種思想中，第一基本是人權，大家公認，每一個國民都有其思想及行動自由的天賦權利，這是神聖至上，不能被剝奪的。第二是民權，何謂民糊呢？政府以及一切制度，都爲全國國民利益而設施，如有違反國民利益的，便沒有存在的理由。第三是國基，以國家的存在爲全國國民生存發展必要的條件，必須種種努力保特鞏固，不能聽受任何損失。以上三點，是爲近代政治思想的精義，也是民主政治的基礎。多少國家，屢次改革，爭鬥，都爲達到此目的。</p>
<p>中國近代的政治思想，也全由此思想脫胎而出。本此思想，所以才推翻帝制，建立民國，打倒落伍的軍閥，政客，創造根據主義革命建國的政府，亦因此思想所以要全國國民投票選舉，建立尊重民權的憲政。數十年來，雖然循序漸進，但是效率實在太低，甚至於可以說不够，但大體說來，總的方向，　是希望向民主的大道椎進。</p>
<p>蘇聯方面的思想，以美國及英法等國的政治爲假裝的民主，落伍的制度，公開相責，毫無顧忌。這一點很可注意。由美國式的民主思想所產生的政府，其立法機關中必須多黨並存。當選較多之黨，可以因民選而執政，但當選較少的政黨，至少在立法機關之中，仍能保持少數黨的地位，監視多數黨的行動，發揮及對方面的見解，使全國國民能認淸事理的眞相。這種狀態，是美國的思想認爲民主制度必須備具的條件。蘇聯的憲政，在憲法上，雖沒有明文規定一黨專政，但在事實上，除了共產黨之外，確沒有任何其他的政黨的參加。所以儘管鼓吹眞正的民主，爲大衆的集體的行動，實際上，蘇聯的政權，實在並沒有依法變更或各黨討論的可能。蘇聯的政治家對於此點，曾經辯護，說並不是不容許他黨，實因蘇聯的歷史及蘇維埃政體，已使一切資產偏見完全消滅了。這種說法，比之美式的民主，當然背道而馳。</p>
<p>蘇聯的政治制度與思想，英美方面都名爲極權制，與戰前意大利的法西斯及德國的納粹性質相同。並且認爲施行極權制的國家決不可能有眞正的民主政治存在，而且因爲此種政治以少數權要的光榮與成續爲中心，勢必貪多無厭，成爲不斷向外擴展的侵略國家。因此認爲第二次大戰以後，世界未能眞正和平，各國仍須發揮大量武裝，其中主要原因，實在蘇聯國內的政制不善，與對外的野心無盡。</p>
<p>在此兩大對峙的局面之下，中國的地位，介處其間，勢必受其影響，因而心理騷動，思想紛歧，地方紛亂。一方面中央政府本歷來實行憲政的方針，用美國式的方法還政於民，布法施政。另一方面，共產黨本蘇聯所傳的敎義，以新民主主義相標榜，破壞已成規模，脫離歷史的一環，烽烟四起，民不聊生。因美蘇思想的紛爭，促成中國政治的混亂，因果關係，實在非常顯明。</p>
<p>在此種局面之下，我國欲求政治的安定，必須靠恃心理的鎭定，和思想的澄淸。蘇聯的積極建設迅速復興的精神，我們應該仿學，但他的政治思想及其制度，實是與衆不同，另成一格，旣不是近代演化所得民主政治的正規，亦決不是中國此時所應走的途徑。中國建國大計要能高瞻遠矚，要看淸歷史的動向，明察實際情形，才能妥定取捨，確定應走的方向。方向旣定，自當共同一致，挺步向前，才不致　途致誤，亦不可歧途興悲。</p>

<p>— 白雨</p>
<p>老畫家豐子愷拜倒梅大王的「裙」下，我感覺像是京派的勝利，忝爲北人，與有榮焉。</p>
<p>不過京海之分，初不在乎籍貫，如梅博士即泰州人，昔徐凌譽先生曾稱之爲梅泰州者，並以爲當與徐東海並列，爲近代吳中偉人之一，如所云，則梅氏豈非可算海派乎？蓋京派者，受舊文化之薰染，不脫傳統的風範，一如治經者之有家法，而又能吸引衆長，以消化而培雍其天賦老也，說來話長，姑以一極小的例證爲引子，而且這也與　派藝術大師　博士有關，可謂巧合、</p>
<p>我常在文字中反對無綫電，尤其反對流行歌曲及難於入耳的爵士西樂，至於窮凶極惡的廣吿，有如古人所說的排闥直入，更是吃不消了。可是最近梅先生的出演，旣無此閒錢買票，更無此閒興怪聲呌好，隨人起哄，適友人借來無綫電一具，通日乃大聽特聽。博士稱爲伶王，然老矣，喉音不無枯澀之惑，美人遲暮，能不黯然！回念昔時聆歌北平中和園，我也不過一初中學生，跳跳蹦蹦，毫不在乎，而博士之儀態萬方，則如藐姑射山上的仙女也。後來在第一舞台演義務戱，竟有不遠數百里由津沽一帶來觀者，甚且預先將行李置於戱院，寢食於斯，以期買到好的票子，此種盛况，又豈今人所及見邪！這些都不必再絮聒，我只介紹那位轉播梅劇的電台廣告報告員，雖也夾雜着報吿某種牌子的絨綫，但完全以京朝派之溫雅口氣出之，而且其主要工作爲報吿劇情及腔調，兼有「說戱」「講故事」兩者之長，運用內行專詞，說明曲調種類，並及出演的堂故，（如鳳還巢曾遭奉派之忌，以鳳奉同音，禁演等）眞覺娓娓可聽，使人一無倦意。曾記前者梅劇團的琴師徐蘭沅先生，在北平電台說戱，細膩曲折，引人入勝，這位小姐，縱不能與之相比，然在海派的在濤中，也就不啻一貼淸涼劑醒酒丸了。（編者按：梅劇轉播時係由稚靑女士說明。）</p>
<p>本來京海之分，起於戲劇，海派重作工而近乎火，京派重規矩唱工而近於瘟，今則往往混爲一談，不火不瘟，亦火亦瘟，甚至弄成四不像，諸如流行之十八羅漢收大鵬以及戲迷家庭紡棉花等是也。眞正京朝派視此當爲之痛哭，眞正海派（如周信芳）亦且不屑爲此，豈不是左右不能逢源乎？以此標準衡量中土文化，往往可作如是觀，不中不西之招牌，不土不洋之房屋，亦中亦西之繪畫，夾中帶西之文章，全是可以使人不快的，正如用外洋牛排佐中國稀飯，吃下去也不很順適，或者還够不上牛排，簡直是臭豆腐干燒番茄乎！</p>
<p>遠在戰前約民國廿二年前後，曾有作家的京海之爭，問題之提出是沈從文巴金諸君，在文藝方面發動革命的反而是對封建氣息極重的北方，主張保守的是南方，至廣九港澳而極。此事看起來甚怪，實則南方乃帝國主義者的基地，對於新思潮，加以非。，絕非偶然；但到後來，南方就發展成爲鴛　與革命兩派，北方的文藝氣氛轉化成學術研究，文歷史，社會科學，在北方都走入新的科學路徑，特別是文史方面，在淸人考據的方法裏滲透大量的西洋科學思想，幾乎使二千年來的傳統全部改觀，對於近日文化之影響，確是不小。同時，在海派中心的上海，則仍自集結了翰林進士之流，大講其桐城古文，宋明理學，其相去正是不可以道里計的，此則又爲北方人所不及料者也。</p>
<p>善於保守傳統者是創造，在舊邊基上，或舊廳堂中加以新的人工，使之雖舊彌新。不善保守的才守株待兎，終至此廳堂樓閣坍塌圯毀而後哭泣嗟嘆去焉。梅博士的劇學，論稟賦論功力，都是家學淵源，但在改進京劇一點上，却又吸收了近代劇的長處，（注意，此非不倫不類，不中不西之洋式門面改善，而是調諧的，中國本位的改善。）所以能够蜚聲歐美，使國劇重振，此即兵法上之以攻爲守，乃京派保存傳統之特點。反觀文藝學術，殆莫不然，即一廣吿報吿員，亦頗知此種趨向之改善，蓋從歷史上旣取精用宏，在地理上又通了中外之郵，其有特殊成績，同與根柢淺薄，寳燕石爲美玉的大爲不同</p>

<p>我國昔有「千金一笑」的說法，現在時代進步了，要百億元一笑了。</p>
<p>白億元一笑」的出典是美國最近發生的一件實事：有一家　家，電綫壞了不肯修、於是在一個風雨交加之夜，這根坡電綫就在馬路邊上垂了下來，正好一個孩子走過，面孔碰着了電綫，立刻觸電受傷，暈了過去。</p>
<p>孩子被送進醫院，治療了好幾個月，總算養好了傷。他的家長就爲他請了律師，要求那家不肯修理電綫的人家賠償損失。</p>
<p>在法庭上，律師突然呌那個孩子面對了庭上的陪審官，律師說：「孩子　你笑一笑！</p>
<p>孩子努力地嚐試着想笑，可是—他的面孔祗有一半現出了笑容，另外一半却已經在那天觸電時燙得像火腿肉一樣，祇露出了幾條深深的醜惡的縐紋</p>
<p>陪審官祇　議了幾分鐘，立刻判決原吿勝訴，被吿應賠償原吿的損失美金二萬元。</p>
<p>這二萬美元也就是那可憐的孩子一笑的代價。我們姑不管黑市美匯的價値如何，即照法定收購價格而諭，這一笑之値豈不也就近一百億元了麽？</p>

<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>我是頭等車廂裏的一個車　，在火車上照料旅客，已有四十三年歷史。從前在車上要當心的是旅客們的身體，開窗呀，關窗呀，風塵僕僕之餘，爲旅客拂拭塵埃呀……等等，但現在有了空氣調節設備，「拂塵」便沒有用塲了。今日的車僮第一要使你身心舒泰，帮助你去欣賞和享受這次旅程。</p>
<p>因爲現在的火車設備進步，車僮的職責可以减輕不少，其實他還有不少可以效勞的地方，尤其是在危急的時候。有一輛頭等車，稱爲「但尼爾」，因爲火車失事，靠了一個名呌但尼爾的車僮；救活了不少人的生命，故即以此節火車稱爲「但尼爾。原來火車頭衝進了這簡火車，但尼爾拼了自己的生命去關上車門，以阻止蒸汽的衝入。</p>
<p>火車上遇到家務爭吵一類事情，原非車僮所要顧問，但是有時你看到兩口子愈鬧愈僵的時候，最好的辦法還是冒昧去渦問他們的別扭。旅程中最頭痛的事情是吵架。某次車上來了一對年輕夫婦，結婚才不過三月，因爲女的到另一　車中去找朋友，一坐談了兩個鐘頭，回來後丈夫和她大吵大鬧。後來她恐嚇地說，到下一站停車，她要回家去了。</p>
<p>「倒是好主意！」丈夫說，「我想這是回到你的家中—不是我們認識他們二人的，還認得他們的父母親和朋友，他們都帶了鮮花到車站上來送行。我把男人拉過一旁，像爺叔一般同他說：「如其　或你的妻子單獨廢然回去，要使你的父母和她的父母都傷心，還有送行的朋友，在紐奧爾良來迎接的人都要懊喪。他們特來找我，叮囑我在旅程中照料你們。因此我要鎖好你的行李，拒絕在下一站停車開啓這節車門。當你們在休息室中時，可以讓你們儘吵一夜。</p>
<p>明大早晨，他們笑嘻嘻的跑出來了。現在他們倆已是一對愉快的祖父母了，我有時要想起，當時我不去管這筆閑賬，他們倆不知分散到什麼地方去了。</p>
<p>使車僮最感頭痛的是在車上找尋失物。有一次開赴明尼波立斯的火車中，淸晨四點鐘，一個驚惶失措的老人跑來吿訴我，她的妻子遺失了一隻鑽戒。我知道她在半夜起來過，因此我便到梳粧室裏去找。可是沒有。我注意到第十號下鋪的兩個女人中間一個也是半夜起來過的。靈機一動，便「軋」出了「苗頭」。</p>
<p>不論是誰拿了這隻鑽戒，現在是不便承認了，因爲她沒有在拿到鑽戒時立刻報吿。我決定讓她自動　舉，藉以尊重她的人格。我站在十號下鋪前面，拉着喉嚨，算是向那對老夫妻講的：「不要緊，車長已經打電報到下一站的警察局，這節車到站要封鎖了通盤檢查。」於是我跑到吸烟室裏去老等。不多幾分鐘，十號下鋪的鈴聲響了，那個女人說她在梳粧室中找到了這隻戒指，「可是不知怎樣是好！</p>

<p>腐爛的蘋果不會使得蘋果樹也腐爛，但是，腐爛的蘋果樹可就不能結果子了。</p>
<p>人生是無盡的沉沉重荷：有許多看得見的生活的負祖，又許多看不見的情感的負祖。單看荒草白楊間的碑碣，就是死了也還有這麽沉重的担子；——你還能擺脫得開。</p>
<p>記得分明的快樂，再分明點，也像隔重紗；忘掉的憂愁，即使忘得乾乾凈凈的，仍然會疑心那是個嘆　中的分明的影子。</p>

<p>— 陳蒙庵</p>
<p>民國十九年五月二十日，北平故宮　物院，曾經舉行一次大規模的游園會，招待中外貴賓，爲的是御花園「太平花」盛開之故。當時拍過好多照片，一太平花」這一個名詞，也曾轟動一時，但是別處很不容易見到。也有人說：這是宮裏的特產，不能够移稱，移種便不生長。按照古書上所說的話，像益部方物略記：「瑞聖花，出靑城山中，幹不條，高者乃尋丈。花率秋開，四出與桃花類，然數十　共爲一花，繁密若綴，先後相繼，新蕊開而舊未萎也，蜀人號豐瑞花。故程相畫圖以聞，更號瑞聖花。然有數種，其小者號寳仙，淺紅者爲醉太平，白者名玉眞。成都人競移蒔囿中，以爲尤玩云。」高士奇天祿識餘：「太平花，川劍南。似桃四出，千百苞駢萃成朶。宋天聖中，獻至京師，仁宗賜名太平花。（劍南詩注略同，惟賜名太平花，作太平瑞聖花。）」根據上面二個說法，那是四川的出產，但是後人又把她當作皇宮裏的特殊東西了。北宋建都在河南，又不曉得什麼時候，又把她搬到北京去？那麽一移種便不生長」的話，是靠不住了。益都方物略記「花率秋開」，故宮博物院的游園會，恰在五月裏舉行，於是開花的時候，成了問題。宋范成大太平瑞聖花詩：一挽春同住夏，看到火西流。」可以證明是初夏開花的確證，本市華隆中醫院花園裘，有一棵樹，開的是白花，都是四瓣，也閒有五出的，微微有一點兒香味，初看不覺怎樣，細細的審察，纔有些與衆不同地方，花兒近都呌她做「外國海棠」。有一天何時希醫師，折了一枝，揷在膽瓶裏，沒有人認識她的眞名字。老伶工委妙看，是種花的專家，種過七八十種奇花。他說：這是「太平花」！檢出故宮博物院的照片來一對，一點兒都不錯，正是「千百苞駢萃成朶」，恰又「先後相縱，新蕊開而舊未萎」，「白者名玉眞」的一種了。調查她的來歷，原是在花店裏買來的盆景樁子，後來漸漸長大起來，移植到地上，不過兩三年，雖沒有「高乃尋丈」，也已有五六尺了，何醫師正替她對花寫照，繪岡題詠，倒是一個絕妙的好詩料。太平花，太平的象徵，爲了世人指鹿爲馬，埋沒眞面目好幾年，如今該是出頭的日子了吧？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>人夏以來，氣候　　，　軀無力抵抗，每患頭暈，身軟，不能出門，昏睡時多。醒時取曲園文集瀏覽，略破岑寂，輒有人天物我之思。兪樾主講江浙書院數十年，爲東南文　祭酒，著述宏富，文詞典瞻，尤長於詩，宗法香山，不爲高古，而自然雅韻，無不盡之意，無不達之情。其晚年所寫老境諸作，皆實情實景，人當少壯時讀之或未能體會，及至桑榆序迫，衰象日增，反覆尋味，乃覺字字如爲我而發，但愧無此老委宛沉摯之筆耳。如云：「未老年華已早衰，况今年老更衰贏。齒疏久廢剔牙杖，骨痺頻施敲背椎，坐處每須長枕倚，立時亦藉短筇支，我生七十便如此，不信人間有耄期。」予未屆七十而患胃病多年，每餐不敢飽貪，然勝利之年，尙能食饅首一個，或米飯一孟，乃近二年中，牙齒逐次脫離，每落一齒，則其隣者必活動，繼之而去，如是一而再，再而三，至於現在，上下牙床僅存三枚，全然無用，非但齒疏，且復齒盡—再讀下文「朝忌葷腥餐白粥，暮防朘削啜紅茶。」以及「蓄痰成飲酸頻嘔」，一切與予今日狀况不謀而合。因無齒故，只能薄粥，因胃弱故，食稍多輒嘔。而坐須椅，行須杖，則不自今始矣。老人又云：「端居深苦食難消，雜沓賓朋又畏囂。回憶兒時翻覺近，偶思門外便如遙。」的確，少壯時過一月是一月，過一年是一年，年月日時，長短久暫自有分別。老年稍一回思，一切皆如昨日，此種心情，亦非到此種境界不能了然。又憶及嚴範孫先生己已年自輓詩云：「向道靑春難便老，誰知白髮急催人！」亦是境到情眞之句。予之數十年生活，不是敎課，便是寫稿，北平之國立私立各校，有賓東之誼者居十分之六七；滬·寗·津·平各報社，爲我文交者亦十之七八。嘔心脫腕，不知幾千百萬言矣（現在應說幾「億」言）！昔之同時執筆者，或已改行，或者作古，而予仍此毛錐（不慣用自來水筆），仍然伏案，則衰頽各態，自非意外，跳頭童齒豁，食少多病，而帶病延年，已非一日。平素於生命修短，了不置念，對於舊說富貴壽考等等，固覺陳腐濫套，但消極厭世，祝宗之流，亦覺大可不必。大化乘除，聽其自然。曲園老人云視生死如蘇杭之往來，其言極是。至其「紅塵易老凌霄鶴」，「白日難留赴堅蛇」，則正堪書諸座右也。</p>

A circular was also sent to the education community nationwide seeking their agreement. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To U.S. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, are of the view that the recent proposals by certain responsible officials in your country for dealing with Japan may lead to serious errors. We wish to offer our humble opinions from the standpoint of candid friends. We would like to state first that Sino-American relations are very close and the friendship between the peoples of the two countries is harmonious and seamless. Any statements we make regarding your policies will be made in complete sincerity and goodwill.</p>
<p>Your country's policy towards Japan, which takes into account the basic living needs of the Japanese people and prevents them from falling into poverty, is based on humanitarian principles and is consistent with our country's policy of leniency towards the Japanese people. However, your country has recently shown a tendency to allow Japan to increase its industry to above pre-war levels and to provide it with substantial material and financial assistance. This is not necessary. As for rebuilding Japan as an industrial center in the Far East and making China and other Asian countries its raw material supply base and its dumping market for manufactured goods, the ambition that Japan held when it launched the East Asian War will be brought to fruition by your country. Would not the sacrifices made by China in its eight years of arduous resistance to this ambition, and the loss of life and property suffered by your country during the war against Japan, be equivalent to waste?</p>
<p>China was the first to resist Japan's war of aggression, fought for the longest time, and suffered the most damage. The living conditions of the Chinese people are even worse than those of the Japanese people. However, your country's assistance to China, after much consideration, is not as generous as your country's assistance to Japan. When we recall that our two countries were allies fighting side by side for democracy, and that Japan was the enemy that attacked your country's vital points by shameless means and killed and wounded your country's soldiers, we are truly bewildered and unable to understand your country's current policy of supporting Japan. If judged by justice, we firmly believe that your country should transfer the aid used to support Japan to China.</p>
<p>If some people in your country harbor the illusion that a resurrected Japan can become your country's ally and can serve as a democratic fortress and a force for stability in East Asia, then we are very willing to expose this illusion. Japan has not changed in essence before and after the war. Its authorities have no real determination to implement democracy, other than using various deceptive means to appear obedient in order to win the favor of your country's personnel stationed in Japan. The lurking forces of its old militarists still exist. If it is allowed to maintain its heavy industrial infrastructure and given the opportunity to rearm, then the Pearl Harbor incident will surely be repeated once its wings are fully grown. Your country's observation of the situation in the Far East is sometimes inevitably isolated. We still remember that since the September 18th Incident, your country has repeatedly ignored the appeals of Chinese people, which led to an unprecedented catastrophe. Today, as we face the resurgence of the crisis, we must do our best to provide you with our loyal advice, and we sincerely hope that you will adopt it.</p>
<p>To seek world peace, East Asia must first be stabilized. To seek stability in East Asia, there must be an independent and strong China. Your country's far-sighted people all hold this view. This grand strategy should not be abandoned because of China's current difficult situation. The Chinese people will always love peace. China is moving in the direction of democracy. The vast majority of the Chinese people are willing to be friends with the United States. Only China can be an ideal force for stabilizing East Asia and does not conflict with the wishes of the United States. We earnestly hope that your country will resolutely abandon its plan to support Japan. Concentrate your efforts and accelerate aid to China with more materials. Enable China to embark on the road to construction as soon as possible. We firmly believe that only by practical mutual assistance between China and the United States, and by jointly cooperating with other democratic countries in the world, can the foundation for lasting world peace be laid.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] Chen Yi's bandits attacked Tai'an on the night of the 29th but were repelled. However, because the bandit forces occupied Motianling east of Tai'an, the defending troops in the city were in an unfavorable position. On the night of the 30th, they proactively withdrew from the county seat and continued to strike the bandits on the defensive line west of the city. Furthermore, several sections of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway have been damaged by bandits, and we are dispatching troops to search and eliminate them.</p>

On the 31st, fighting continued in Wand and Dakou to the north and south. Although the bandits suffered heavy losses and gained these two empty cities, they actually gained nothing. The National Army is now waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Furthermore, it is reported that three of the seven bandit columns on the north bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong have crossed the river and fled south to the vicinity of Yuncheng.

<h3 id="e19">Recent Commentary on Educational Trends <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), special attention has been given to the reconstruction of education and youth in countries damaged by war. Therefore, much sympathy and importance is attached to the current state of education in China. Recently, Mr. Aubry, commissioned by UNESCO to investigate education in China, has completed his investigation in Shanghai and proceeded to the capital. He will then go to various places such as Peiping, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Hankou, and Guangzhou for detailed investigation and research. In light of this, we can easily think of the current state of education in various departments of our country, especially the recent student strikes in several universities. This may give a bad impression to educators from friendly countries who sympathize with us. However, we believe that Mr. Aubry's longer and more detailed observations will not be limited to superficial appearances. In addition to urban areas, he will also look at rural areas. In addition to dynamic aspects, he will also examine static aspects. In particular, he will recognize the various internal and external difficulties faced by Chinese education, and the reconstruction achievements and progress made in the midst of hardship. We would like to take this opportunity to make some brief comments on the current trends in national education, secondary education, and higher education for discussion.</p>
<p>The "basic education" that UNESCO emphasizes is mainly national education in China. In the wartime and the three years after the war, it can be said that steady and substantial progress has been made in poverty and hardship. We must thank the advocacy of some education experts and the unyielding efforts of countless national school teachers. Although we were in the midst of the War of Resistance, national education achieved good results in both system and substance. However, after the restoration, national education was greatly restricted by financial difficulties under the circumstances of public and private difficulties. Therefore, the government's allocation of 800 billion yuan to local basic education funds is truly an important matter for current education to meet needs. This fund is included in the national budget. The Ministry of Education only officially disclosed it in March, and a local basic education symposium was held in early April. The main topic was the principle of allocating this fund. In mid-April, the Minister of Education also solemnly mentioned it in a report to the National Assembly. It is now heard that it has begun to be distributed to various provinces and cities according to the principles discussed by experts. In order to cooperate with the needs of constitutional governance and meet the goals pursued by UNESCO, this is an extremely reasonable and urgent measure. We hope that the distribution of this fund will adopt the principle of focusing on key points. The authorities in various provinces and cities must carefully use the special funds allocated this time to maximize their effectiveness. Strictly speaking, this matter only indicates the government's intention to promote demonstration. In fact, the increased fundraising for national education funds depends more on the county-level finance to bear the burden and the cooperation of social forces. In this time of unrest and national treasury difficulties, if the government cannot afford education funds to the ratio stipulated in the constitution, we believe that we can only encourage social and private donations more. The authorities in various provinces, cities, and counties must pay close attention to the economic hardship of education, and in addition to making good use of the basic education subsidies this time, they should also refer to the "National Education Funding Reorganization and Fundraising Measures" to raise as much funds as possible to expand basic education and consolidate the foundation of our constitutional government.</p>
<p>Secondary education is a link between the past and the future. Now, public and private secondary schools are equally struggling financially, and secondary education after the restoration, whether in terms of equipment, teachers, or especially student level, is generally far inferior to before the War of Resistance. We should sympathize with secondary school teachers and appeal on their behalf to reduce the burden of teaching and increase salaries and benefits—this is precisely the major premise for laying a good foundation for students above the specialized level. As for from a social point of view, an even more urgent matter is the importance of vocational education at the secondary level.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 35th academic year, among the 5,892 secondary schools nationwide, only 724 were vocational schools, accounting for only about 12% of the total, which is a really too small proportion. Considering the difficulties of our national economy, it is even more important to consider the future of young people in general. Rather than graduating from ordinary secondary school without being able to go on to further studies and having no expertise in finding a job, it is better to consider career goals before entering school and prepare for professional training. Moreover, the construction projects of various departments of the country are in need of mid-level cadres trained by secondary vocational schools. The Ministry of Education and various provincial and county bureaus should support and add vocational schools and increase the number of vocational classes in the future; and young people in general and their parents should also change their concepts, face reality, and, except for those who are determined and able to go on to further studies, should actively enter vocational schools. We believe and earnestly hope that UNESCO member states can give us valuable guidance and assistance in this regard.</p>
<p>Speaking of current higher education, we can simply say: the state finances (that is, the people's taxes) bear the greatest burden for education in this department, but unfortunately, the situation shown by some universities is the most turbulent and excessive! The most obvious form of this turmoil—student strikes—of course greatly damages the student level and the reputation of the academy. All mindful university professors and university students, how do they think their image given to compatriots (that is, people who indirectly bear the cost of universities) by these events, and how does their representation of our country's education give international people a perception, it should have reached the point of unbearable words and unbearable thoughts! In the difficult restoration of higher education over the past year, the most common report we have seen in the newspaper is destructive strikes. We will never ignore the youthful era of depression, the difficult life of professors, we also heard the various reasons advocated by young students; we believe that rational guidance and solutions should be added, but we really wonder: why can strikes be held by a few people and tolerated by the majority of university teachers and students? Since the student unrest in Peking University and Peiping Normal College in April, the Central University, Jinling, Chung Cheng University, Hunan University, Sun Yat-sen University of Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, and Yingshi University have had strikes in mid-May, and some have not yet resumed classes today. When Mr. Aubry inspects the universities in Peking and Shanghai, he will definitely discover that there is only too much "freedom" in the academy, too free speech, and will doubt what some propaganda calls "controlling" youth and "persecuting" youth is all about. Many emotionally impulsive and pure students still mostly do not believe that the government or public opinion points out that the Communist bandits are instigating student unrest. We will not analyze it for the time being; we only represent the fair public opinion and reiterate: strikes "only destroy the students' own studies, despise and deny the spiritual life of professors, and at the same time stifle the effectiveness of the entire education!" Therefore, we would like to sincerely appeal separately: (1) the majority of university students should have "intellectual self-awareness." Your dissatisfaction with reality and blame begin with waiting and watching, and end with being controlled by violence. Only when the majority of people exert their courage to express their true opinions can the minority be afraid of causing trouble and acting recklessly, and can maintain their studies and reputation, otherwise they will lose all social sympathy. Secondly, (2) university professors must re-use their "scientific brains" and stand up and unite to express their opinions in order to maintain the freedom of lecturing and the dignity of the academy. Because the current student unrest created by certain cores is by no means a dispute between the government and the "people," let alone a party dispute, but a corner gate between science and anti-science, education and destruction! In addition, we hope (3) that the education administrative authorities and the security authorities must be responsible and more cautious during this time. The education authorities must pay attention to eliminating and guiding more than preventing after the event, inducing pure students to be self-aware more than punishing students; and the security authorities must understand the psychology of young people, should not habitually use official jargon, let alone deal with it hastily, and should try to avoid stimulating the emotions of the majority of pure students in preventing and stopping disturbances. Today, the country is in great difficulty, and the "persecuted" higher education is facing a crisis. How to turn danger into safety and cultivate the progress of science is mainly the responsibility of the "rational" majority of professors and students.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Yang Mei Fever Reaches its Climax, Second Stage Test Awaits Mutual Consultation, Elementary School Students Write Eagerly to Director Li, Hoping He Can Answer the Reason for Not Eating <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Chongqing, May 31st electric] The "Yang Mei fever" among the people of Chongqing has reached its climax today. Yang Mei and Li Zhiyu, at the invitation of our newspaper, attracted even more public interest when taking photos at the Health Bureau. British female reporter Diphneinosley and Associated Press reporter Madsen had a secret talk with Yang Mei's guardian Zhuo Songdai separately today, hoping to take over the next step of research on Yang Mei. Dr. Jiang Zhuohua, the director of the Municipal Hospital, once urged Zhuo in front of our newspaper reporter to refuse euphemistically. How this matter develops depends on whether the next step decision of the Health Bureau can be accepted by Zhuo. Director Jiang and Director Hu Xianwen both urged Zhuo to postpone the return of Yang Mei to Jiulongpo. Zhuo insisted on signing a contract. Therefore, after Zhu Shaoliang summoned Yang Mei at 2 pm, he immediately took the Health Bureau ambulance and left the hospital with Yang Mei. However, the Health Bureau still sent two nurses, Liao Junming, etc. to accompany her and continue to inspect. More than 20 photos of Yang Mei with Zhu Shaoliang, Li Zhiyu, etc., and life photos will be published in our newspaper within days. In addition, the miracle of Yang Mei's not eating has caused a serious reaction from readers due to the continuous publication in our newspaper in recent days. Li Zhiyu received a letter from Feng Baocai, a 14-year-old elementary school student from Zhangjiazhai, Zhongzheng West Road, Shanghai, on the 24th. A special excerpt is as follows: "My father is a worker in the factory. His monthly salary is very small. In addition to my mother, there are two younger brothers, one older sister, and one younger sister at home. There are six people eating at home, and only my father produces. I see my father working hard all day and returning home from the factory dejectedly. My heart is very sad. I hope you can tell me the results of Yang Mei's research and what she ate that she doesn't need to eat food. If a person doesn't need to eat food and can still do things as usual, isn't it possible to reduce my father's heavy burden? In this way, my younger brothers and sisters may be able to study for a few more years, because I am very worried that we will be called to drop out of school at any time. If you tell me the reason for not eating, not only my brothers and sisters will be grateful to you, but all the elementary school students in Shanghai or the whole country will be equally grateful to you, at least the children of poor fathers like us will have this feeling.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper Chongqing, May 10th electric] (Late) The initial observation of Yang Mei's not eating can be concluded on the 31st. The Health Bureau's three-week observation report to be announced tomorrow first describes Yang Mei's simple brief history, then describes the Health Bureau's attitude of only observing and not testing, and the method of not forcing Yang to eat or not eat, then copies the detailed records of the accompanying nurses for the past 21 days, and finally hopes that Yang Mei's continued test can break the highest record of 74 days for professional fasters at home and abroad. The report was sent to domestic scientists and famous people for reference on the 31st, and it is hoped that all circles will quickly give opinions for the selection after the establishment of the next step inspection agency. Director Li Zhiyu of the Health Bureau believes in Yang Mei's not eating 100%. He hopes that Yang Mei can cooperate with the Health Bureau for a long time, and is discussing with Zhuo Songdai. When the report is publicly released on the 31st, Yang Mei will be invited to take a group photo as a souvenir, and two pairs of triangular silk pants, a set of woolen shirts and pants, and a pair of cotton shorts and long pants will be presented to Yang Mei on the spot. The report states that Yang Mei's characteristics are: (1) She does not like cloudy days. Her skin is cold on cloudy days and she does not drink boiling water. (2) She loves movies and likes red. The difference between her and professional fasting is that there are no physiological changes within 21 days, no hunger or fatigue, and she loves to walk around, which is no different from ordinary people.

<p>[Our newspaper Chengdu, May 27th News] The southwest artery, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, has been actively repaired since it resumed work in May of the 35th year. Before the War of Resistance, most of the bridges, culverts, and tunnels in the Chengdu-Neijiang (Jiang) section of the railway had been completed, and the roadbed stone and earthwork had been completed by more than 5 million cubic meters. From January to May of this year, 60% of the entire project in the Chongqing-Neijiang section was completed, and it can be completed this year. 40% of the entire project in the Chengdu-Neijiang section has been completed, and it can be completed next year. As for the budget for the first half of this year, it is listed as 300 billion yuan according to the January number, which is seriously insufficient. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for supplementary increase, and it is hoped that the United States will provide loans.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper Chengdu, May 27th News] The Chengdu Municipal Government decided to build the Chengdu trolleybus in order to build a large Chengdu. Recently, it was introduced by Jia Shanna, the representative of the French Economic Delegation, and assisted by the famous French Jia Ke Meng Tram Manufacturing Company in the design. The planned total budget is 1,363,000 US dollars, including power plants (including seven generators), car factories, lines (12 kilometers long and four lines), vehicles (20 trolleybuses) and other equipment. According to Jia Shanna's talk to reporters: this budget only needs 743,500 US dollars when converted according to the new exchange rate of the French franc. The French banking group is willing to lend 90% of the entire cost, and Chengdu will raise 10% by itself. The municipal government has now invited gentry and merchants, and decided to raise funds to form a preparatory office for the Chengdu Tram Company, actively work, and issue municipal construction savings bonds to raise capital. After the short-term fundraising is completed, it will formally sign a contract with the French banking group.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Sichuan Citizen Luo Hongzhang Invented Power Machine <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Chengdu, May 27th News] Luo Hongzhang from Santai, Sichuan, recently invented a kind of labor-saving power machine in Chengdu. It uses the vibration force of the pendulum and the principles of "flywheel", "centrifugal force" and lever wheel axle, and is made of domestic iron and wood. It can be used as the original power for oil pressing, sugarcane pressing, and all important industries. This machine only needs one person to shake it, without the need for an internal combustion engine or electric motor to shake it. The cost is very low, and the efficiency is more than ten times higher than that of manpower. It has now applied to the government for a patent.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Improved Foreign Exchange Management Receives Good Response from All Parties <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Tianjin, May 31st electric] After the announcement of the foreign exchange settlement certificate method, the Tianjin trade community responded flatly. Authoritative sources pointed out that the current trade system will have to be completely reformed to meet this method. The import quarterly approval method cannot continue to be implemented. All parties believe that the new method will have a significant effect on absorbing overseas Chinese remittances.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency This City News] After the government formally announced the improvement of foreign exchange management and adopted the foreign exchange settlement certificate method on the 30th, all parties responded extremely well. The Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed leaders from all walks of life to learn about the repercussions of this new measure. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Yujiu, executive director of the China Import and Export Trade Association, said: Under the new method, the import exchange rate is increased, which can protect the domestic agricultural, industrial, and mining industries to a considerable extent, and can avoid the phenomenon of excessive profits from imported goods. However, to promote exports, it is necessary to immediately supplement various nationwide loan methods under the new method, such as collateral loans, exchange loans, packing, etc., to be effective. Furthermore, the settlement certificate should be issued at the same time as the settlement, and it should not wait until the time of shipment to issue it.</p>
<p>Yan Jingzhong, general manager of the China Silk Company, said: The cost of raw silk has always been very different from foreign prices. However, after the announcement of the new method, if silk goods are sold, it will be in a superior profit state, and the profit is about 20% to 30%. Furthermore, if silk underwear is transported overseas, the profit will be higher. Our country's silk weaving industry should take this opportunity to quickly catch up and strive to improve quality to meet international market standards.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of the Ancient and Modern Are Copyrighted</p>
<p>Song Binglun, executive director of the Shanghai Import and Export Trade Association, said: Regarding the central bank's adoption of the settlement certificate method this time, I believe that it is a wise measure. It has two characteristics: (1) The new method enables exporters to sell the foreign exchange obtained from exports to designated banks at the listed price, and the difference between the insufficient amount can be transferred to compensation when selling the certificate. If this is the case, export trade will greatly increase. (2) Overseas Chinese remittances are expected to increase. In the future, overseas Chinese remittances will no longer have to escape in the black market, and they can gradually be brought into the right track.</p>
<p>Tang Jisan, chairman of the Shanghai Tea Export Trade Association, said: Promoting exports and earning foreign exchange is what the government has always valued. The issuance of the settlement certificate this time is the most thorough and fully demonstrates the government's hope for export business. We should be aware of this and strive to promote it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 30th electric] The Central Bank's representative in Hong Kong said today: The foreign exchange control regulations announced by the Central Bank yesterday are actually a limited free trade system. This regulation has aroused great interest in the commercial and financial circles here. He believes that the abolition of the foreign exchange regulations controlling imports will encourage large-scale imports and overseas Chinese remittances. The new policy will also simplify my country's import and export trade, and will also have some impact on preventing smuggling. He said that he has not yet reached a decision on the rumors that the purchase and sale of my country's legal currency is prohibited in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper Taipei, 31st electric] The Taiwan Provincial Railway Bureau invited reporters today on the car burning incident, saying: The cause of the fire is said to be gasoline and camphor powder, but there are still doubts, because there was a loud bang, which may be caused by the burning of highly explosive chemicals.

Each ship can carry at least 100 soldiers, a small arsenal, and a wireless motor. This will be used as the backbone force for suppressing pirates. Each ship's draft is relatively shallow, making it most suitable for use in the Pearl River Delta and along the East, West, and North Rivers to chase pirate speedboats. It can also attack armed bandits occupying fortresses along the river. Yue Chairman Song Ziwen hopes to use this to combat pirates and Communist bandits, and can solve the organized smuggling problem in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>[Airmail report from our newspaper, Shenyang, May 26] The September 18th Incident of 1931 sparked an upsurge of anti-Japanese sentiment in the area between Changbai Mountain and Heilongjiang. The Japanese invaders, plotting to occupy "Southern Manchuria," were about to advance into "Northern Manchuria," eager to open up the passage from Korea to Northeast China, and actively planned to build the Jilin-Huining Railway. When their surveying team reached Fengsheng Zhezi in the middle section of the Jilin-Huining Road, they were completely wiped out by Wang Delin, the battalion commander of a border defense force. The Japanese invaders launched an attack with land and air forces, holding out for three months. That was the story of November 5, 1931. The name of the patriotic hero Wang Delin became known throughout the country. That was indeed an extraordinary story.</p>
<p>Wang Delin's Wife</p>
<p>Crown of Honor Lies Buried Underground. In March 1933, after a heroic struggle, anti-Japanese heroes such as Wang Delin, Ma Zhanshan, and Li Du had to lead their troops into the Soviet Union and return to China via a roundabout route. General Wang Delin, harboring the ambition to recover his homeland, went into exile within the customs. In the winter of 1935, he went to Rehe, hoping to get assistance from General Fu Zuoyi to reorganize the anti-Japanese forces in the Northeast, but his wish was not fulfilled. Unfortunately, he died of illness in solitude in the spring of 1937 in a military camp in Yishui, Southern Shandong. At that time, he was the commander-in-chief of the Restoration Army. Yishui was his hometown, and he had organized guerrilla forces behind enemy lines.</p>
<p>The old general rests peacefully underground with his crown of honor, but his family, consisting of his 52-year-old wife and a young daughter, lives a bleak life in a remote corner of the Northwest. If it were not for their unfortunate circumstances, they might have remained unknown for life.</p>
<p>Ran a Mill to Provide Education for Her Daughter. By chance, this reporter met Wang Delin's wife, who had been stranded in the Northeast for two years, yesterday. She tearfully recalled the past. Her painful life experiences made her so sad, but she would always be satisfied with General Wang's patriotism and honor. Wang's wife said:</p>
<p>"We met at Zhengzhou Railway Station in the 26th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1937). He said, 'You go to Xi'an, I'm going to do my thing.' After that, we never met again. When he was at the front, he often wrote in his letters that his money was enough, without asking if we had any money. I knew he was very poor..."</p>
<p>General Wang's death was a deep blow to Wang's wife. After shedding her tears, she had to continue living and raise her child. She opened a mill herself, grinding flour for people, and sent her child to school. Life was hard enough; she didn't even have money to cut her child's hair. At that time, some old friends of General Wang occasionally gave them sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>After the victory, the Northeast was restored. Wang's wife thought that she still had a few acres of thin fields in her second hometown (Jilin, Yanji) to live on for the rest of her life, so she resolutely took her daughter, Miss Jianhong, on a refugee ship from the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" to the Northeast. As soon as she set foot on the land of the Northeast, she realized that she had had a beautiful dream. She could not return to her hometown, and she had no relatives to turn to, so the mother and daughter had to work in the refugee factory of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Northeast Branch, and later had to rely on the refugee camp in Tiexi. Kong Xianrong, the National Assembly representative who committed suicide in Nanjing, was a comrade who raised the flag of righteousness with General Wang Delin, like brothers. Although General Kong was unable to provide for their livelihood during his lifetime, they still received a lot of spiritual comfort. After General Kong's death, their lives became even more desolate.</p>
<p>Unable to Bear to Drown Her Child. Wang's wife said sadly, "I set my sights on a pool of water under the bridge in Tiexi District, but this child, Chuanghong, always stayed by my side. If I jumped, what would happen if she followed me? She is still young! She should still have her future."</p>
<p>A few days ago, the mother and daughter wrote to Madame Chiang, hoping that she could have pity on their plight. Wang's wife said that she would be endlessly grateful if the government could provide relief to maintain their minimum living standards. She has high expectations for her daughter's future and hopes that her daughter will be allowed to study at the school for the descendants of anti-Japanese soldiers. This lady lost her opportunity to study early and has to do some small things in the cooperative of a certain agency, which is still not enough to maintain her life. Her mother carried her from the Japanese artillery fire when she was very young and later opened a mill to provide for her education. These deep impressions often make her shed tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>Social figures here are very concerned about the descendants of General Wang Delin. Madame Han Quan-hua, the wife of Wei Lihuang, has inquired about their lives and has reportedly expressed her intention to send them to Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Life of Kong Xianrong's Descendants. The future lives of Kong Xianrong's wife and young son are also a cause for great anxiety. Recently, the mother and son came to Shenyang from Changchun. The plane tickets were all donated by various sectors of Changchun. Kong's wife said, "Kong Xianrong's troop continues Kong Xianrong's cause, which is a great spiritual comfort to me." Kong's old troops were recruited by his long-time comrade-in-arms, Lang Yunpeng. Lang said, "It is an insult to say that Mr. Kong committed suicide for some reason. His death was indeed due to his concern for the country and his indignation at the world. It was a form of remonstration through death. We should understand him, learn from him, and inherit his great spirit, and strive for the country and for the Northeast!"</p>

<h3 id="e38">Establishing a Constitution and Organizing a Democratic Government: The Korean National Assembly Holds Its Opening Ceremony. Syngman Rhee Elected Chairman, Declares He Will Negotiate with the Soviet Union. Hodge Announces US Troops Do Not Intend to Withdraw for the Time Being. <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, May 31] The first Korean National Assembly, elected on May 10 under the auspices of the United Nations and boycotted by the Soviet Union, opened at 2 pm on May 31, paving the way for Korean independence and unification. Two hundred representatives from the 157 electoral districts of South Korea, representing two-thirds of the Korean population, will meet to carry out the following three tasks: (1) to formulate a constitution on which the Korean government will be established and the president will be elected; (2) to seek ways to unify South Korea under US military occupation and North Korea under Soviet military occupation; and (3) to solve the difficult economic problems of the people. There are also 100 vacant seats reserved for representatives from communist North Korea, but they are not expected to participate. The Soviet Union has refused to allow the United Nations Commission on Korea to enter North Korea to oversee nationwide elections. The temporary chairman of this National Assembly will be Dr. Syngman Rhee, the 74-year-old leader of the Korean Independence Promotion Party. 85 of the members are non-partisan, 54 belong to the Korean Independence Promotion Party, 30 belong to the Korean Democratic Party, whose chairman is the pro-Japanese Kim Seong-soo, and 11 belong to the United Youth Party. Many of them are so-called independent figures who have ties to the Korean Democratic Party.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, May 31] The Korean Assembly, which was created as a result of the United Nations-sponsored election on May 10, held its first meeting on the 31st. The 73-year-old anti-communist political leader Syngman Rhee was elected speaker and immediately declared with pleasure, "The Republic of Korea is reborn." Rhee's election process only took 90 minutes. He then made an acceptance speech stating that the government that the Assembly is about to create will have sovereignty over all of Korea, including North Korea, which is currently occupied by the Soviet Union. Rhee then listed his policy agenda: First, US troops should continue to remain stationed until the Koreans are able to defend themselves by forming an army. Even after the withdrawal of US troops, American technical personnel should remain as advisors, especially in the economic field. Rhee said: The Korean government will attempt to "conduct friendly negotiations directly with the Soviet Union to fairly resolve public issues between the two countries." He gave the Korean communists "one last chance to repent and return. If so, we will forget the past and not hold them accountable." Otherwise, the Korean communists will "be subject to severe legal sanctions, and no foreign power will be able to assist them." (This was clearly addressed to the United Nations Commission on Korea, which had pressured both the US and South Korea to release 3,800 political prisoners.) Syngman Rhee promised to eradicate corruption, eliminate speculation among government officials, accelerate the organization of a national defense army, control prices, and legislate to protect freedom of publication, speech, and assembly. He also said: "Although the US military will remain stationed for some time due to the international situation, once the Korean government formally requests its withdrawal, the US military will return home immediately. We should understand this point, that the presence of the victorious army will not interfere with our sovereignty." Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, and Major General Dean, the military governor, both replied that the United States would never force the Assembly and was willing to assist in all aspects if invited. The transition of power will gradually unfold. According to the current plan, the US military does not intend to withdraw. The United Nations Commission has always been disregarded here because its representatives mostly drafted reports in Shanghai, so only assistant representatives from China and France were sent to attend, which greatly dissatisfied the Koreans. The prestige of the Commission has been dealt another blow. Only half an hour after the Assembly meeting began, police arrested 21 people from six groups who were distributing leaflets and waving flags against the Assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Byrnes Advocates Negotiations with the Soviet Union on All Issues Between the US and the Soviet Union. Condemns Stalin's Erroneous Diplomatic Strategies. <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, May 30] Former Secretary of State Byrnes said today in a speech at the graduation ceremony of Winthrop College in Rock Hill, South Carolina, that the United States should be willing to discuss all issues with the Soviet Union that do not involve the governments of other allied nations. At the same time, the United States should continue its plan to strengthen its national defense. He believes that the United States should not forget the words of the ancient Indian chief, "Deceive me once, shame on you; deceive me twice, shame on me."</p>
<p>Byrnes apparently attaches more importance to the Soviet Union's recent peace offensive than Marshall. He said, "I have always believed that the Soviet Union will continue to expand its expansionist policy to the limits allowed by democratic countries. When the Soviet Union recognizes that it cannot continue to move forward without war, I believe it will abandon its war of nerves and seek a solution. The Soviet Union today has recognized that we do not have nerves that cannot be frightened; on the contrary, we have the strength and are prepared to use this strength to defend our freedom and, through the United Nations, to defend the freedom of other free nations with the courage to resist aggression." Byrnes also condemned Premier Stalin for publicly answering Wallace, the leader of the US Third Party, instead of directly addressing the President of the United States. Byrnes also said that the most important thing is not the subject of wealth, but whether he expresses sincerity in his willingness to resolve differences. The US government should be prepared at any time to discuss issues related to the governments of the two countries with the Soviet government, and the United Nations should be used as a tool to preside over negotiations on issues related to the governments of other allied nations.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, May 31] The long-silent Soviet official newspapers have begun to launch fierce attacks on the United States again. "Pravda" said that since Marshal Stalin suggested discussing the issues between the US and the Soviet Union, the attempt of the United States to conceal its aggressive policy with hypocritical words has completely failed. Since Marshal Stalin's reply to Wallace's open letter was published, the embarrassment of the US ruling class has become more and more obvious. Honest people all over the world not only regard Stalin's reply as proof of the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy, but also feel that it is a concrete plan put forward to consolidate world peace.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Temple, Texas, May 31] Secretary of the Army Royal declared here tonight that the Soviet Union is now spending almost three times as much on military spending as the United States, so how can it be said that it has no aggressive intentions? The Soviet Union has 175 combat divisions, plus about 100 auxiliary divisions and police, which are not included. The Soviet Union has no enemies in Europe and Asia, so why does it need this military strength? It is really difficult to understand.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, May 30] The American Communist Party recently passed a resolution expressing its delight at the growing movement to support Wallace's presidential campaign. The Communist Party believes that there is indeed a need to establish such a third party in the United States. Although the Communist Party will put forward an independent plan in the election, and may even run for Congress and government positions, it will also give the greatest support to the progressive candidates of the People's United Movement.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Results of the Czech Election: The National Front Wins. The Number of Blank Ballots is Unexpectedly High <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Prague, May 31] The high percentage of blank protest votes in the Czech general election has forced the Ministry of the Interior to dismiss the ballot counters employed by the authorities and count the ballots itself. Blank votes in Prague average about 25 percent, and in some areas, they reach as high as 50 percent.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, May 31] After the final results of the Czechoslovak general election on Sunday were announced, it was revealed that the Communist Party-controlled National Front won 89.2 percent of all valid votes, accounting for 80.1 percent of all registered voters. The authorities did not announce the number of invalid votes and abstentions. Since there was no opposition party running, voters who opposed the National Front could only be measured by the number of blank ballots, invalid ballots, and abstentions. The most unique phenomenon of this election was the way in which blank ballots were cast. It is rumored that some voters attached photos of Churchill and the late Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk to the ballot envelopes. Other voters wrote "Tomorrow we are coming" on the ballot papers. Prague Radio announced the victory of the Communist Party, saying that this free election proves that the Czechoslovak people are willing to have the new regime continue to govern and can also prove that the crisis in February was actually beneficial to the country. The National Front can now accelerate the implementation of its revitalizing reform plan with the support of the people nationwide.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Cairo, 31st] A report from "Al-Samani," Amman, states that Iraqi troops have reached the coastal area north of Tel Aviv, effectively splitting Israel in two.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] According to reports, a communique announced that Iraqi armored units are less than five miles from the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, and are now fully engaged in pursuing the retreating Jewish troops from the Khulm area, pressing towards the city of Tel Aviv. Earlier reports from the Arab Legion stated that its forces had reached Ludd and Ramle, twelve miles east of Tel Aviv, while Egyptian forces in the south are also rapidly advancing towards Tel Aviv along the coastal highway. In Jerusalem, Arab forces have completed new deployments, preparing for a full-scale assault on the Jewish areas of the new city.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Although only forty-eight hours remain before the deadline for accepting the recent Security Council-imposed truce order for Palestine, the Arab allied forces have accelerated their advance to complete the encirclement of the Israeli capital from three sides in time.</p>
<p>The Egyptian forces in the south, after advancing to the key town of Isdud, twenty-five miles south of Tel Aviv, have concentrated their forces north of the city, preparing to continue their advance. Aside from a few Israeli aircraft carrying out attacks, there have been no reports of determined ground resistance. The Arab Legion in the central sector, although still needing to deal with Jewish troops in the new city of Jerusalem and attacking Latrun, reports that its troops have advanced to Ramle and Ludd, only twelve miles from Tel Aviv. The Iraqi forces in the north, advancing from the central plains of Palestine, occupied the village of Qalqilya, now less than eight miles east of the Mediterranean coast and only fourteen miles south of Tel Aviv. It is speculated that the intention of the Arab allied forces is to encircle the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, before the deadline of 11:30 PM on June 1st for accepting the Security Council ceasefire order, and to isolate the Jewish areas in northern Palestine and the Jewish forces in the central region.</p>

An Israeli spokesman stated: that he does not yet know whether Israel will agree to accept the demands passed by the United Nations Security Council on the evening of the 9th, despite Israel's strong opposition. The words of the Arab official are highly significant, as countries originally believed that the Arab nations would accept the new demands of the United Nations, but after the official's statement, there is now a general fear that the Arab nations may reject them.

<h3 id="e61">British Industries Fair <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— (Special correspondent in England, Sa Ben Geng)</p>
<p>(London dispatch) The 1948 British Industries Fair was held from May 3 to May 14. The first fair was held in 1915. It is an organized exhibition of the country's major products, with the aim of encouraging and promoting commerce. The first fair was held in London and 591 exhibitors participated, covering an area of 88,714 square feet. It was organized by the Overseas Trade Department of the British government. From the name of the organizing body, we can imagine that it was not only for domestic purposes, but also for foreign trade.</p>
<p>In 1920, the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce also organized a heavy industry exhibition, which became the mechanical section of the "British Industries Fair". From this year onwards, the fair was held annually in Birmingham and London. The former can be said to focus on machinery, metals, and ironware, and is organized by the local Chamber of Commerce, but with the support of the government. The latter focuses on light industry and is directly managed by the government, formerly by the Overseas Trade Department, now by the Export Promotion Department of the Board of Trade. This is a very important administrative unit in the British government, and the Director of the Board of Trade is a member of the Cabinet. When the Birmingham and London fairs were held simultaneously for the first time in 1920, 1,689 units participated, covering an area of 315,088 square feet. In 1939, 2,338 units participated, covering an area of 826,433 square feet.</p>
<p>From the past experience, this kind of fair has two characteristics. First, it is national in nature, and only products produced in Britain or any part of the British Empire can participate. Second, with the exception of textiles, only the actual producers of the goods can participate. The former is probably because this is a fair to promote national goods, and the latter is probably to facilitate trade. The reason why textiles are excluded is probably because textiles themselves include several independent manufacturing processes, and it is difficult to determine who is the actual producer.</p>
<p>This year's fair is still held in London and Birmingham. It is estimated that more than 3,000 units participated. If you walk around all the exhibition counters, it is equivalent to walking 25 miles. Merchants from all over the world were invited to visit in advance. According to the latest published figures, about 15,000 foreign businessmen from 108 different locations came to visit this time. The Birmingham section is open to everyone at any time, while the London section is open to the general public for only three days. Visitors must buy tickets, naturally one ticket per person per entry, but merchants can purchase a badge with an invitation or other proof, which allows them to enter and exit the venue at any time.</p>
<p>The content of the exhibition can be divided into two parts. The London section is divided into two locations (however, in addition to the regular transportation between the two locations, there are also special vehicles that provide free transportation). The exhibits include chemical drugs, optical and photographic equipment, sports equipment, printing machines, musical instruments, radios, stationery, children's toys, jewelry, watches, leather, woolen fabrics, clothing, furniture, and so on. Birmingham focuses on electrical machinery. Birmingham is one of the industrial centers of England, 113 miles from London.</p>
<p>This fair has a promotional nature. Due to the seriousness of Britain's import surplus problem, its significance is even more important. As a Chinese person, after seeing this fair, I think there is one thing that should be mentioned here, that is, we visitors saw some things in this fair that are not available in the British domestic market at all. In other words, they really tightened their belts and brought all the good things for business. (May 16, 1948)</p>

<h3 id="e62">Punishing Overseas Fishing; Shelling and Sinking Japanese Ships Fleeing; Military Judge Interrogates Fishermen at Night; Naval Commander Recounts Discovery and Pursuit <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A Japanese fishing boat intercepted by our navy's Zhongjian warship in the waters near Yushan (also known as Shaweishan) off the mouth of the Yangtze River on the morning of May 29th was escorted to Shanghai yesterday by the Zhongjian warship and berthed at the Gaochangmiao River. The name of the fishing boat is not "Jingxian Maru" but "Unzen Maru No. 22," weighing 99 tons, carrying 13 fishermen and over 800 boxes of fish. In addition to Unzen Maru No. 22, the Zhongjian warship also sank another Japanese fishing boat, Unzen Maru No. 21, weighing 99.81 tons, that night. Except for one crew member who jumped into the sea and is missing, the remaining twelve crew members were rescued by the Zhongjian warship's lifeboat and were also escorted to Shanghai yesterday. Therefore, a total of 25 fishermen were sent to the headquarters of the First Naval District in the afternoon yesterday, where military judge Li Youjian interrogated them overnight, and reported to the Naval Headquarters in Nanjing and the Ministry of National Defense to request instructions on how to deal with them. Because there have been frequent reports of Japanese fishing boats intruding into our territorial waters recently, and with the current evidence, it is feared that it will lead to international negotiations.</p>
<p>The Zhongjian warship was given by a major country, weighing 4,000 tons, and is currently used for naval training. This time, 41 students from the Qingdao Naval Academy came to Shanghai. At noon on the 28th, they received an order from the General Headquarters, instructing them to intercept the four Japanese fishing boats intruding into our territorial waters. According to Commander Lin Fu and Deputy Commander Chen Donghai's account of the events, after receiving the order, the warship continued along its original route. At 2:30 AM on the 29th, they discovered two Japanese fishing boats about one nautical mile to the right of the course, about 98 nautical miles northwest of Yushan. The boats had lights on and were hauling in their nets. The Zhongjian warship ordered the two fishing boats to come alongside, but the other party ignored the order and continued to haul in their nets, turned off their lights, and then dispersed, one heading towards the bow of the Zhongjian warship and the other heading towards the stern, fleeing in different directions. The Zhongjian warship immediately concentrated its firepower and opened fire on the first boat. Although the fishing boat was hit by several shells, it still sped towards shallow water with injuries. After chasing for about ten minutes, they gave up due to the shallow water. The other boat had also disappeared. The Zhongjian warship then continued along its route and, after three quarters of an hour, discovered another two Japanese fishing boats, Unzen Maru No. 21 and No. 22, about 90 nautical miles northwest of Yushan.</p>
<p>Alert and Waiting to Capture in Advance</p>
<p>Given the escape of the previous two boats, the Zhongjian warship turned off its lights this time and approached at medium speed. At the same time, it was on alert in advance. When it approached, the two fishing boats were still casting their nets. However, because it was night, the warship circled the two fishing boats to prevent accidents, intending to wait until dawn before sending small boats to capture them. Unexpectedly, about an hour later, the two fishing boats exchanged light signals and fled in different directions again. Since the Zhongjian warship was already on alert, it immediately opened fire upon seeing this, sinking the twenty-first fishing boat. At this point, the twenty-second fishing boat did not dare to escape anymore. The Zhongjian warship then lowered its lifeboat and rescued the Japanese crew, boarding them onto the warship. This was around 4:20 AM on the 29th.</p>
<p>The Zhongjian warship commander pointed out that the position where the two fleeing fishing boats were discovered was at 33 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees 50 minutes east longitude, and the position where the two intercepted fishing boats were located was at 32 degrees 52 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, both to the right of the Zhongjian warship's route from Qingdao to Shanghai, so they were absolutely in our territorial waters.</p>
<p>May All Be Military Disguised</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter saw the two fishing boat captains, Nakano Kameji, Shimomura Kazunaka, and other crew members on the Zhongjian warship. They were wearing old military uniforms and may have been naval personnel before. Photos of them wearing naval uniforms were found among their belongings, and some people were wearing round commemorative badges of the July 7th Incident, inscribed with the words "Commemoration of the Japan-China Incident, 1937 Ishiguro Team". Although no weapons were found on them, our naval personnel speculated that they may have thrown them into the sea. According to the confessions of the two captains, Nakano Kameji and Shimomura Kazunaka, the two fishing boats belonged to the Kawaminami Fisheries Industry Co., Ltd. of Japan and sailed from Nagasaki on May 16th, with a total of 20 boats. They gradually sailed towards the Chinese coast because they could not find any fish in these seas. When asked if they understood that they should not intrude into Chinese territorial waters, the two admitted that they were wrong and claimed that they did not understand international law. They also claimed that they did not dare to fish in the Hokkaido fishing area of Japan because they were afraid of the Russians.</p>

<p>The names of all the arrested Japanese crew members are as follows: Unzen Maru No. 21: Shimomura Kazunaka, Nakamura Nakayasu, Iida Shigeru, Ogawa Mitsuo, Okamoto Haruo, Shindo Tetsu Suzu, Kaneshuichi, Yamashita Hiroki, Kawaguchi Tadao, Ishitani Masukichi, Katsuo, Sakurai.

<h3 id="e63">Rice Ration Price This Month at $500,000 per Dou; 15% Lower Than Market Price; Ren Xianqun States It Is Not a Long-Term Solution <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The rationing price of rice for Shanghai in June has been decided by the authorities to be $500,000 per dou per person. Mayor Wu gathered representatives from the Food Department Ye Shifu, the Executive Yuan's US Relief Committee Pan Guangjiong, the director of the People's Food Allocation Committee Ren Xianqun, etc., at the municipal government at 5 PM yesterday, to hold the fourth Shanghai Rationing Grain Price Negotiation Committee. During the discussion, it was considered that the rice price in the second half of May was not normal. After discussion, it was decided to determine the rationing price of rice in June at $500,000 per dou based on the lowest possible interpretation, and immediately exchanged opinions with the Yuan Committee in Nanjing by long-distance telephone.</p>
<p>Ren Xianqun, the director of the People's Food Allocation Committee, told reporters yesterday: that he seemed very satisfied with the newly determined price of rationed rice for June. He believes that from yesterday's three-person meeting, it was found that China and the United States can still sincerely cooperate. According to regulations, the rationing price should not be lower than 5% of the market price, and the new price for June is already about 15% lower than the market price.</p>
<p>Forcibly Suppressing Rice Prices May Affect Production</p>
<p>However, Director Ren believes that forcibly suppressing the price of rationed rice is not a good phenomenon, as it may affect production. Because the current rise in rice prices is less than that of other commodities, excessive suppression will inevitably reduce farmers' interest in growing rice, so it is not a permanent solution. This kind of policy is also not favored by those with foresight. Director Ren said: The US government's continued provision of rice aid to China after June is indeed the best news at present, because the supply of domestic rice will be difficult starting next month, and almost all of it will depend on US rice aid.</p>
<p>US Rice Aid Extended for Half a Year</p>
<p>It is reliably learned: that the US Relief Committee has decided internally to extend rice aid to China for half a year, ending in December this year. The US government has also allocated US$12 million in advance to purchase rice as quickly as possible in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Burma, etc., which can purchase 75,000 tons of rice, so the per capita ration of rice in Shanghai in July can still continue.</p>
<p>Oil Price</p>
<p>The rationing price of oil for this month has also been determined to be 12 taels per person for soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil, at $93,000. Raw sesame oil is $108,000.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Some Labor Unions Dissatisfied with May's Cost of Living Index; General Labor Union Believes Method of Calculation Should Be Reconsidered <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the cost of living index for May was announced yesterday, the Municipal General Labor Union continuously received calls from industrial unions such as the public utilities and cotton textile industries, expressing dissatisfaction with the May worker index, believing that the index of 337,000 times only increased by 29% compared to the previous month, while prices in this month unfolded the so-called "May inflation", and its rising index, although there are no official statistics, is far beyond the ratio of 29%, which anyone can intuitively feel. After receiving the calls, the person in charge of the Municipal General Labor Union held informal discussions on the reasons for the daily decline in the worker's cost of living index, believing that the main reason for the low worker index is that the rice item (7.5 dou), which accounts for a higher percentage in the worker index, is calculated based on the rationing price since the city implemented per capita rice distribution. Although the rice in the employee index is also calculated at the rationing price, its percentage is lighter than that in the worker index. At the same time, the employee index lists items such as silk, wool, movies, and fruits, while the worker index lacks all of them, but in fact, movies, fruits, silks, etc. are also essential to the lives of workers, so it is recognized that the method of calculating the index in the future really needs to be reconsidered.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] An unpleasant incident occurred last Saturday during the United Nations Shanghai Office's International Week, at the International Youth Celebration held at the Shanghai American School. When the celebration was half over, and the young people from various countries in Shanghai were getting along harmoniously, a group of "uninvited guests," Chinese students, suddenly stormed into the venue carrying anti-American banners and gave speeches opposing American support for Japan. The banners depicted "Uncle Sam" using money to cultivate Japanese warlords, displaying extreme sarcasm. The venue was thrown into chaos, and the festive atmosphere was completely ruined. Gibbs, the principal of the Shanghai American School, who had clearly stated when borrowing the school premises for International Week that the celebration had no political nature, quickly turned off the lights. In the darkness, shouts and excited voices mixed together, and the lights were soon turned back on. Gibbs protested to Mr. Jiang, the organizer of International Week. Mr. Jiang, taken by surprise, expressed great astonishment and apology. However, the students continued their anti-American propaganda, and Gibbs turned off the lights again. The celebration then ended unhappily. Gibbs officially lodged a protest in writing yesterday to the person in charge of International Week.</p>
<h3 id="e67">A Few Students at Shanghai Law College Exhibit Reactionary Cartoons Patriotic Students, Incensed, Tore Down the Cartoons Exhibition Organizer Beats Students, Several Injured <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Law College on Jiangwan Road held a grand celebration for the inauguration of the new president, Chu Fengyi, and the 20th anniversary of the tenure of school board member Qian Xinzhier during the past two days. A small number of professional students took the opportunity to initiate a "Current Affairs Cartoon Exhibition," which was publicly unveiled in the school yesterday. The content of the cartoons was extremely insulting and defamatory to the head of state and the government. The most absurd ones included: (1) a portrait of Mao Zedong, captioned "Leader of the People's Liberation Army"; (2) a depiction of the President and Vice President walking towards Yuan Shikai's tomb, titled "Almost There"; (3) a depiction of "China's Big Emperor" (a portrait of President Chiang) kneeling and presenting "New Twenty-One Demands" to an American, titled "Another Yuan Shikai." In addition, there were several wall posters titled "Heaven and Earth," the contents of which were all used to disparage the government and damage Sino-American relations. The majority of patriotic students in the school, recognizing that these reactionary propaganda materials were obviously created by communist elements, were filled with outrage and could no longer tolerate it. Several students angrily tore down the aforementioned reactionary cartoons at around 3:00 PM yesterday. The professional students who were in charge of the cartoon exhibition tried to stop them and tore up a portrait of "Mao Zedong" to destroy the evidence. The two sides initially argued, then started fighting each other. The fight escalated from inside the school to outside, lasting for a long time. During the fight, several students sustained minor injuries, and another student, Ru Zhefu, suffered a concussion and abrasions on his waist after jumping from a third-floor window. After persuasion from a majority of students, the conflict ended. The college president, Chu Fengyi, and the dean of students, Zhu Zhouchun, rushed to the school upon hearing the news to handle the situation. The injured students were taken to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment in police vehicles. Those with minor injuries were bandaged by the doctors and then discharged. The situation inside the college has returned to normal.</p>
<p>During the conflict, the students reported the incident to the North Sichuan Road Police Station by telephone. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a police car to maintain order. While passing near the side entrance of Zhongzheng Park, they encountered a group of students holding students Yao Jinghan, Liu Jiannong, and Cai Jincheng? together with the torn reactionary cartoons, and handed them over to the police, accusing them of being the organizers of the reactionary cartoon exhibition and the assailants. The police took them to the station for questioning. After separate interrogations, the person in charge of the branch bureau hastily prepared a report overnight and forwarded the collected reactionary cartoons, publications, and interrogation records of the students taken into custody to the general bureau, which transferred them to the Special Court for investigation and prosecution according to law.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Checks Cannot Be Used on the Same Day Only Silverware Industry Implements Restrictions But Those Duly Accepted or Verified Checks Are Not Restricted <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of bank customers depositing checks from other banks, which cannot be used until they have been collected, has been decided to be implemented on the 1st. The person in charge of the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau recently further explained as follows: This case was already circulated by the Ministry of Finance for implementation last summer. This measure is actually based on the fact that some customers prematurely issued checks before they had the money, which not only inflated credit and increased the speed of circulation but also increased the number of returned checks, causing anxiety in the financial market. Therefore, it was necessary to impose some restrictions. However, the practice of using checks as collateral has been a long-standing tradition, and it would be difficult to avoid inconvenience if it were suddenly canceled. Therefore, in order to take into account the facts, the implementation period was repeatedly extended at the request of the silverware industry and the business community, and compromise measures were formulated. Recently, various sectors have expressed concern about this, so a few points are further explained:</p>
<p>1. The restriction that checks cannot be used on the same day only refers to checks. Other bank drafts, certified checks, and legal bills of exchange are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>2. Even with checks, not all checks cannot be used on the same day. Those that have been duly accepted or verified are still allowed to be used at any time. Therefore, the issue lies in whether it has been "collected" or not, and not whether it is "the same day".</p>
<p>3. Recently, representatives from the China Industrial Association and the Industrial Trade Association came to the bureau to request that the restrictions on the use of checks be relaxed appropriately. The bureau agreed that for checks issued with the consent of the silverware bank or firm and a collateral contract has been established, the checks may still be used within the agreed valid term limit.</p>
<p>4. It is expected that the number of returned checks may increase in the first two days of the implementation of the measure of not using checks as collateral, but this is a temporary phenomenon and will decrease afterward. The bureau has also paid close attention to prevention and hopes that the business community will be especially careful with the checks they issue. It is best to have them certified by the bank or firm in advance or negotiate properly before issuing them to avoid returned checks.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks declined as the environment was unfavorable. Hot stocks declined sharply, while miscellaneous stocks were still flat. Due to export materials, China Silk was the only one to show profits, with a stalemate at closing.</p>
<p>In the early morning, market sentiment was already weak due to various adverse effects. Wing Spinning opened low at 2,650 yuan. After opening, there were no transactions and it sold to the 2,600 yuan mark. With the support of No. 69 and others, it rebounded to 2,675 yuan, but market sentiment was already lost and it struggled at the 2,600 yuan mark. Brokerage fees opened high at 32 yuan and 36 yuan, and No. 160 and others sold it to 2,530 yuan. No. 197 and others still bought, raising it to 2,555 yuan.

Compared to the morning closing, Sino-French, Jingfu, New Light, Matches, China Silk, and Xinhua rose by half, Tongyi Underwear was flat, and the rest rose slightly.

Type A retreated from 74.5 yuan to 72.5 yuan, closing at 72.8 yuan. Type B retreated from 76 yuan to 73.5 yuan.</p>

The situation was very boring. Compared to last Saturday, Ewo Spinning, Amoy, Union Brewery, and Steel Industry declined slightly, the British Union and Jardine Matheson fell by half, and Printing and Publishing and Shipping declined sharply by about 10%.</p>

<p>American textile expert Mr. Dodd has decided to be stationed at the Yarn Control Committee office to assist in the utilization of US aid cotton. It is learned that Mr. Dodd arrived at the committee yesterday and discussed cotton allocation issues with various responsible departments.</p>
<p>In addition, the Yarn Control Committee recently issued a statement from its person in charge regarding recent external criticisms of the committee's cotton sales, stating that the sale of cotton is to cooperate with the Central Bank's tightening of credit. Because tightening credit is a comprehensive policy, if other materials are sold off without cotton, the price of cotton will inevitably rise. The Yarn Control Committee's action was taken after consultation with the Central Bank. Moreover, the sale price is lower than the market price, which proves that there is little profit involved. As for the alleged suspension of sales, it is also incorrect. The Central Bank has recently consulted and decided to sell another six or seven thousand dan (a unit of weight) or so, and will stop selling after this amount is sold.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Tightening of Interbank Positions, Sluggish Rice Trading, People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Continues to Sell Rice Yesterday <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee continued to sell rice in the rice market, selling a total of six thousand shi (a unit of volume) in the North and Second Municipalities, with the price unchanged at 5.6 million. Due to the inability to use bills of exchange outside the market, most transactions specified next-day bank drafts, causing peers to feel the squeeze on their positions, so transactions were very rare. White japonica rice, thin indica rice, initially opened at 6.8 million, but the market weakened by 50,000 due to a lack of buyers. Early rice and "Yangxian" rice prices remained unchanged, while white yuan rice retreated to 7.8 million. Yesterday's arrivals were even scarcer due to the rain, totaling 2,337 shi in the North and Second Municipalities.</p>
<p>Flour: The market opened early due to patronage from outside customers and the rebound in inland prices, resulting in active sales and positive sentiment, which pushed prices up. Old car flour opened at 2.13 million, and warship flour opened at 2.11 million. Later in the market, due to limited appetite from outside customers and continued supply, and poor absorption by local businesses, old car flour retreated to 2.1 million, and warship flour closed at 2.08 million, with both seeing hedging. Red bee flour remained unchanged at 2.04 million, while Jiancheng flour saw more buying due to North Gang export licenses, rising by 60,000. Bran was up 20,000, while wheat did not open.</p>
<p>Grains: The market trend was generally weak. Due to the inability to use bills of exchange, and unstable sentiment, trading was sluggish and slow to open. Later in the market, some trading opened, mostly specifying next-day bank drafts. High-quality soybeans were stable. Second-quality Hankou soybeans traded at 3.12 million, while high-quality soybeans traded at 3.3 million. Ningbo white silkworm new goods were listed for the first time yesterday at 3.6 million. New yuan wheat arrivals were down by 200,000. Corn was not absorbed by the North Gang, falling by 200,000. Mung beans saw limited trading, red sorghum fell by 50,000, sesame seeds weakened, raw peanuts were stable, with only Qinhuangdao raw peanuts opening at 13 million unchanged.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Due to the inability to use bills of exchange, most transactions were for next-day bank drafts, causing a prolonged standoff between buyers and sellers. Trading only opened slightly later, resulting in extremely rare transactions. Oil mills opened with soybean oil prices stable. Dayou soybean oil traded at 10.05 million. Only a few barrels of Qingdao Jibutong raw oil were traded, opening at 18 million. Raw vegetable oil and clear oil saw little fluctuation. Jibutong small cart sesame oil opened first at 17 million. Soybean cake initially opened down 20,000 to 30,000, then rebounded slightly, ultimately falling by 10,000.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Bank Discount and Loan Committee held its fifth meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Yu Hongjun himself, with all committee members in attendance. More than 20 cases reviewed by the Industrial, Mining, and Agricultural Advisory Committee were approved and will be submitted to the Joint Board of Directors for deliberation. After the meeting, Yu told reporters: In order to stabilize prices and control the market, the government has repeatedly tightened credit recently to reduce currency, which was unavoidable. The establishment of this Discount and Loan Committee has been underway for a month, and its work is gradually unfolding. In the future, if industrial and mining production enterprises have real and legitimate needs, they can apply to specialized banks for loans in accordance with regulations, and this bank will provide appropriate assistance and adjustment to the lending banks through rediscounting and re-pledging.</p>

<p>Yesterday's credit conditions showed a slight tightening trend.

<p>Summer woolen fabrics have continued to trend downwards recently. Although retail prices at shops have not been significantly reduced, wholesale market prices at tea parties have all weakened. The reason is that most of the sales to Japan have passed, and actual sales are gradually decreasing. With abundant goods in the market, prices are difficult to rise. Yesterday, local factory pile cloth sold for an average of 4 million to 5.5 million yuan per yard, while "Fanliding" cloth sold for 4.67 million to 6.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Tung Oil Purchase Temporarily Suspended <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's purchase of tung oil for export on behalf of the government has been interrupted since its inception due to the constant fluctuations in the black market foreign exchange rate. At yesterday's regular meeting of the Export Goods Appraisal Committee, it was noted that the government has promulgated new measures for export foreign exchange settlement, and exporters can export freely under the new measures. Therefore, the purchase of tung oil is no longer necessary. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily suspend the purchase work starting this week.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Silkworm Cocoon Loan Approved for 63 Companies <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 31st] The cocoon loan will be fully transferred to Wuxi before the opening of the market on the 3rd. The number of approved manufacturers in this county is 63. There are 26 loan cocoon firms in the counties under its jurisdiction. It is reported that the price of fresh cocoons will reach 40 million due to the extremely heavy cost.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were affected by the inability to use bills of exchange on the same day, making sentiment even more apprehensive. Interbank credit tightened, and the sudden suspension of sales by the Spinning and Construction Company, coupled with sparse purchases by out-of-town buyers due to rain, caused long positions to unwind one after another.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell immediately at the opening, and although there was some price support midway, the final price was 300 million yuan due to excessive supply and limited demand, a decrease of 16 million yuan compared to last Saturday. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 8 million to 16.7 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were characterized by the imminent strict implementation of the bill of exchange restriction measures, resulting in stagnant circulating capital and tighter credit in the market. There were very few entrants into the market. Except for some additional purchases by local businesses, businesses from North Gang, Shanxi Gang, and Hankou Gang all sold, and transactions were not smooth.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell by 90,000 yuan at the morning opening. Subsequently, the new foreign exchange settlement measures improved sentiment and briefly rebounded by about 60,000 to 70,000. However, due to the tightening of positions and continuous sales by cargo owners, and the news of declining yarn prices, the closing price was 6.9 million yuan, down 190,000 yuan from last weekend. Other cloths also saw declines of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, but the Shilin cloth market remained stable. After the close, Dragon Head fine cloth fell further to 6.85 million yuan, with few buyers.</p>
<p>In addition: Regarding the cotton yarn market the day before yesterday, due to the fact that bills of exchange cannot be used on the same day starting today, a special notice was issued to change the delivery procedures. In the past, the market's transactions were based on the principle of delivering goods with checks and settling on the same day. Now it is specifically stipulated that starting from June 1, all transactions in the market must be delivered with interbank drafts and settled clearly on the same day.</p>

<p>Since Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun announced the new measures for import and export foreign exchange settlement the day before yesterday, the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee held an emergency meeting yesterday morning. Chairman Chen Guangfu, committee members Liu Gongquan, Shen Xirui, and others attended, and Import Management Committee Chairman Huo Baoshu also attended. They discussed how to coordinate future foreign exchange stabilization work with the new settlement measures. In the future, the focus of foreign exchange stabilization work will shift from adjusting exchange rates in the past to balancing the income and expenditure of foreign exchange positions. The authorities believe that if the income and expenditure of foreign exchange positions can be balanced, it will be of great benefit to the implementation of the new policy. It is also heard that there will be changes in the export management policy. The new policy may be to relax the current control standards slightly. It is generally estimated that this relaxation may be difficult to implement in the short term. The authorities still need to conduct appropriate reviews of the effectiveness of the new policy over a certain period of time before they can make a decision. When Import Management Committee Chairman Huo Baoshu answered reporters' questions about the commutation policy yesterday, he only said that the Import Management Committee does not intend to change the quota announced for the fifth and sixth seasons. However, news from another reliable source said that the Import Management Committee is indeed drafting a plan to change the current control policy.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Kunming, 31st] Wu Shuzhao, a student at the private Nanching Middle School in Kunming City, usually enjoys reading radical books and participates in student movements. At the beginning of this semester, after taking tuition and luggage from his mother, he did not register at the school and disappeared. On March 2, he sent a letter saying: "My father's thinking is stubborn and I cannot get along with him. The destination is only three days away. Please do not worry," which indicates that he has joined the Communist area. Recently, Wu Shuzhao also wrote to a classmate named Zhang, saying: "In the past, I was encouraged by one or two friends, and in a moment of impulsive enthusiasm, I rashly left my parents and joined the Communist area. For two months, I have tasted the bitterness. Although I know I have been deceived, I am trapped in the Communist den, unable to advance or retreat, and I want to cry but have no tears. I deeply feel that I have let down my parents, and even more, I should not have abandoned my studies and been used by others. I am currently in good health. Please tell my parents not to worry. If I get the chance, we will meet one day." Wu Shuzhao's regret in escaping from danger should be a warning to young students who are deceived and act rashly.</p>

<p>[China News Agency] According to news from the China Science Society in this city: Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Central Forestry Research Institute, the Peking Institute of Biological Research, and the Department of Forestry of the National Central University discovered ancient dawn redwood trees in the Sichuan-Hubei border area, scholars from Britain and the United States have come to China to seek specimens. Its seeds were sent to the Royal Horticultural Society of Edinburgh and botanists. Six seedlings have grown in the Royal Botanic Garden. In the United States, Dr. R.W. Chaney, an authority on paleobotany at the University of California, and Dr. M. Siloerman, an editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, came to China to collect four seedlings and transported them by air to Berkeley, where they were planted in the greenhouse of the University of California. Dr. Xue said that most scientists believe that dawn redwood, like dinosaurs, may not be able to survive anywhere in the world, but they came to China in February and obtained specimens and returned to the United States in March. This will be the first batch of dawn redwood trees to grow in the United States in 25 million years. According to the United States, only redwood (Sequoia) survives among the ancient trees. The discovery of surviving dawn redwood (Meta Sequoia) in China is its only surviving species. Previously, only Cenozoic fossils of dawn redwood were discovered in the United States and Europe. There are now more than a thousand large and small dawn redwood trees in Wanxian and Lichuan and other places.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital has refuted the accusation made by the Henan Student Association of Fudan University regarding the death of the school's student Wang Huiwan, accusing the hospital of "neglecting its duties and treating human life like dirt." The hospital has recently released the following information regarding the deceased Wang Huiwan's admission and treatment history: "Patient Wang Huiwan was admitted to the hospital on April 10 of this year. After examination and diagnosis, it was determined that he had (1) bilateral third-stage ulcerative pulmonary tuberculosis, (2) left-sided spontaneous pneumothorax, and (3) left-sided tuberculous empyema. There are X-rays and laboratory reports to prove that the diagnosis is accurate. The patient's general health was very poor. He had continuous fever, rapid pulse, and shortness of breath, so the patient was ordered to rest absolutely quietly and given sedatives and nutrients, which were never interrupted. Six thoracentesis procedures were performed to drain the thick fluid, which slightly lowered the high fever and made the patient feel slightly more comfortable. However, subsequent X-ray examinations still showed that the lung tuberculosis lesions were continuing to progress; the pneumothorax and empyema also did not show any improvement. On the evening of May 21, the condition suddenly worsened, with difficulty breathing and a continued increase in body temperature. The air pressure in the left chest cavity continued to increase, so an emergency critical illness notice was sent to the president of Fudan University, and the patient was immediately treated with oxygen inhalation and continuous extraction of air from the left chest cavity to maintain breathing. However, the condition deteriorated rapidly, and after day and night rescue efforts by medical staff, it was ultimately ineffective, and the patient died of illness on the morning of the 24th."</p>

This year, the Naval School will recruit 200 students, and the Mechanical School will recruit 100 students. Registration locations will be in Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, Taipei, and eight other places.

<h3 id="e131">On "Essentials of Studying the Classics" <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Xiong Shili</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Xiong Shili's book "Essentials of Studying the Classics" was published in the mainland, and many people in the coastal areas cannot obtain it. This is a masterpiece in the Chinese intellectual world and should not be ignored. This article is a letter from Mr. Xiong to the readers, and the important points of the book are very important. With the permission of Xiong Guangsheng, it is specially disclosed as follows.</p>
<p>The "Essentials" not only solves the problem of studying the classics, but also opens up a new path for the academic and intellectual circles in the two to three thousand years since the Qin and Han dynasties. It is a pity that in a declining world, scholars are accustomed to superficiality and chaos, and there is no one who can speak of this matter.</p>
<p>The first lecture begins with explaining the Dao, which is the main purpose of the new theory. Zong San said that the loss of printing is a ghost, and the loss of Westernization is a thing, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>Next, speaking of the nine meanings of governance, the preface says, "Governance arises from following the constant Dao," which is the key sentence. The classics say that governance is indeed based on the constant Dao. These nine meanings are broad and profound, and the organization and function of the rule of law are actually included in the rule of virtue or the rule of rites. The nine meanings are extremely harmonious in this kind of place, unlike the pedantic arguments of the former Confucian scholars on the distinction between kingship and hegemony.</p>
<p>Worldly Confucian scholars like to talk about rites and music, but they do not really know rites and music. Among the nine meanings, the best one is on rites and music. The preface and harmony are developed very deeply and far-reachingly. Rites emphasize concession, which seems incompatible with today's Westernization, but I have grasped its basis. One is based on the theory of mutual assistance in science, one is based on the wholeness of the theory of life in philosophy, and the third is based on the spirit of democracy, which also lies in concession. Theory and fact are all-encompassing.</p>
<p>Westerners speak of governance, basing it on desire, while classics scholars speak of governance, basing it on nature. These are all insightful words, unchangeable arguments.</p>
<p>The distinction between nature and emotion was not clear to the former Confucian scholars. In the nine meanings, it is split very actively and meticulously. If you do not reflect on it with your own body, then you will just read it as words, alas.</p>
<p>Human Dao is finite, but desires are infinite. This meaning is vast, profound, and extremely subtle. In the nine meanings, talking about this, the writing is also vast and boundless.</p>
<p>Taking the three outlines and eight items of the Great Learning as the summary and essence of the Six Classics and Confucianism, the more I think about it, the more I feel it is meaningful. The reason for heaven and man is actually prepared in this, and those who are careless and superficially understand people will not realize it. Mingde Zongyang Ming is indeed irreplaceable. Sincerity, then my new interpretation corrects the mistakes of the Song and Ming masters. The investigation of things from Zhu is the most profound meaning. Concluding with Confucian conduct, the classics are complete in every meaning. In short, it is all the constant Dao, all unchangeable.</p>
<p>The second lecture begins with distinguishing the will, which is indeed extremely essential, but it is a pity that today's people cannot speak of this. Then criticizing fame, and explaining it with the three fears, every word is the blood of the sages. If today's scholars never understand, they will only be slaves for all generations, can they learn?</p>
<p>Speaking of Western learning, but not abandoning the classics, there are three meanings, all of which are grand, genuine, and cannot be ignored. The decline of China lies in unification. Chinese people are not weak in scientific thought, nor are they without democratic thought, it is a pity that the environment after Qin restricted them. Recent people only rely on Song and Ming learning, and say that Chinese and Western cultures are absolutely different. After reading the second lecture of the Essentials, they will know that it is not necessarily so.</p>
<p>The criticism of Lao Zhuang is golden words, which cannot be ignored. For more than two thousand years, the Chinese people have lost their vigorous and innovative vitality, Lao Zhuang and Buddhism have misled them. Can this not be deeply studied?</p>
<p>The few paragraphs of criticism of Buddhism are golden words. For two thousand years, Buddhists have not seen this, and those who oppose Buddhism do not study Buddhism at all, so how can they say half a word? Buddhism and Taoism, talking about the essence, are always immersed in emptiness and silence, but the Dao of our Confucian Great Change has never been empty and silent, but it is necessary to see that the essence is originally vigorous. Vigorousness is without any defilement, without a trace of attachment, and has never been empty and silent. The function chapter in the middle volume of the New Theory has already extensively developed this meaning, and my son did not reach this point when he made the commentary. In the Essentials, this kind of place is mentioned from time to time, all of which are essential and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Vigorousness is therefore constantly changing, so it is constantly growing. Confucian philosophy can incorporate the West, but it is also very different from the West, because Westerners have little self-reflection and have not seen emptiness, and they only focus on knowledge and little on life.</p>
<p>The evaluation of Lao Fo is the core issue of Chinese academic thought for two to three thousand years and cannot be ignored. My son has already sympathized with the distinction between Han and Song, so I will not mention it again.</p>
<p>The third lecture, speaking of change, still follows the new theory. Its development of vigorousness and growth, and the clarification of the opening of the universe, cannot be said that there is no mind in the age of inorganic matter, but it is just stable and not obvious. In the Qian Gua, the explanation of self-improvement is linked to the evaluation of Zhuangzi in the second lecture. These cannot be ignored. Speaking of change, all talk about governance, and also emphasize that people are autonomous and independent, and do not harm each other. If the world eventually destroys itself, then so be it. If not, then can this meaning be opposed? Modern times emphasize groups too much and harm individuals too much, turning people into machines. This is a real worry for humanity. Our classics can save mankind, and this is where it lies.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Spring and Autumn Annals, change does not lose its constancy. This meaning is best understood in conjunction. The disciples of Kang Youwei only use the method of copying books, picking up the words as talking points, how can they know the meaning of the three generations? In the past, Mr. Zhang Mengqu despised Youwei the most, he had a discerning eye!</p>
<p>Speaking of the Book of Documents, there are not many words, but the meaning is profound and grand. According to the Analects, Mencius, Zuo Zhuan, and the Doctrine of the Mean, we find the tradition of the central method of the Two Emperors and Three Kings, to see where the Dao and the rule of law come from, there is no attachment, so it can be known that the book is a classic and not a history. Speaking of the Book of Poetry, it is based on the words of Confucius. And the Confucian philosophy of life can be seen. Few poets and writers in later generations have mastered the classics.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Three Rites, it is most meaningful. It is necessary to develop reason to save the ills of knowing only the family and not knowing the society. However, the fundamental meaning of rites is seen in the very essence of the records of rites, and we must choose for ourselves. The world is in chaos, and my old age is sad. If the theory cannot be made, then how can it be enough to reach this?</p>
<p>Speaking of the Zhou Rites, there is also a far-reaching meaning. I will mention its outline, and detailed explanation will have to wait for future generations.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Leisurely Thoughts on the Lake (1) <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Lone Gull</p>
<p>Humanities and Nature</p>
<p>The vastness of the universe can be easily imagined by reading a few modern astronomy books. When you look up at the sky at night, you see thousands of constellations densely surrounding you. But the vastness of the distance between those stars is quite amazing. The stars in space are like a few sailing boats or a few gulls on the sea. We can say that the emptiness in the universe far exceeds the truth. Although those star clusters shine brightly, you can also think that the darkness in the universe far exceeds the light.</p>
<p>There is the sun in the universe, the earth in the solar system, life on earth, and humans in life. The position of humans in the entire universe is really too small. For example, in the vast wilderness of the dark night, there is a little light, which at most only illuminates a few inches of land near it, and the rest is pitch black and completely unknowable. This little light emitted by the course of human life is even more appropriate, it should be like a firefly. Although the firefly flies forward, its light shines on the tail end behind it. Human knowledge can only know what has already happened, and rely on some knowledge and memory of what has already happened to rush forward, towards this infinitely unknowable future.</p>
<p>If you pay too much attention to the natural world, just like a pedestrian in the dark wilderness of the night, always staring into the endless darkness, it will make you terrified and confused. But some people pay too much attention to your personal life. You should know that personal life is still a nature, the same emptiness is better than the truth, darkness is better than the light, the same in the endless darkness, human wisdom has to find the truth in the emptiness and the light in the darkness, that can only be found in the accumulation of the past historical culture of the human group. These cultural heritages (accumulated by the past history of human groups) we call humanities, and use them to oppose nature. This is the truth, the light, but these are just a little light at the tail end of the firefly. How can the historical and cultural heritage accumulated in human life in the past contend and stand side by side with the entire vast universe of the natural world. But as far as people are concerned, this is the only way, this is the so-called human-centered view. In the traditional Chinese view, the natural world is called heaven, and the humanities world is called man. The Chinese use humanities to resist nature on the one hand, and highly raise humanities to stand side by side with nature, but on the other hand, they advocate the unity of heaven and man, and still want both parties to harmonize and integrate, neither talking about nature swallowing up humanities, nor wanting to use humanities to conquer nature.</p>
<p>Taoism also has the theory that heaven and man do not defeat each other, (see Zhuangzi) but Taoism takes too little account of the group work of historical culture. Each individual can only say that his score of heaven is more and his score of man is less. On the one hand, it is great, and on the other hand, it is small. How can heaven and man not defeat each other? Therefore, Xunzi wanted to say that Zhuangzi knew heaven but did not know man. But Xun's claim that human nature is evil does not really recognize the truth of the group work of human historical culture. If you analyze and look at one person after another, then humans do have various shortcomings and various sins. Because each person is only a part of nature. But if you understand the overall view of the historical culture of the human group, then how can all the good in the world be created by the human group work, and how can you say that human nature is evil? Western Christian thought, just as it pays attention to one individual after another, and does not inject its eyes into the accumulating work of the large group of historical culture, therefore it must also advocate that human nature is evil, and say that life and sin come together. In this way, it will inevitably erase life and return to nature. Buddhism also has the same tendency, it is necessary not to value the large group work of historical culture, then it is bound to be pessimistic about life, they only list individual lives to establish arguments, they are not willing to shift their gaze, thinking on the infinite accumulating work of the large group of historical culture. In modern Western thought, freed from their medieval Christian doctrines, they returned to the ancient Greek concept, affirming life positively on the one hand, but on the other hand they still pay too much attention to the individual. As a result, the humanities cannot catch up with natural science, and material ideas are rampant. People with a heart still have to turn back and beg for the spirit of medieval religion to remedy the current pain. As far as personnel are concerned, the way out in the future may only be to dilute individualism, convert to the collective karma of historical culture, and re-propose the old Chinese traditional concept of heaven-man balance and heaven-man unity.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Aristotle on Individuals and Reality <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— One Finger</p>
<p>Plato regarded Ideas as true and things as illusions - in his eyes, Ideas are Reality and things are illusions. Since Aristotle did not agree with the separation of Ideas and things, and since he advocated that concepts be obtained from things, the existence in his mind is things (generally called things, singly called individuals). However, what he calls individuals includes two aspects: (1) concept, (2) matter. The concept he calls form, and the matter he calls matter. These two parts have an inseparable relationship in individuals.</p>
<p>Individuals are the object of all learning. Generally speaking, all learning requires form. The principles and corollaries of science are the forms sought by science, and the concepts and categories of philosophy are the forms sought by philosophy. It's just that the forms sought by each branch of learning have different distances from matter. For example, physics and chemistry are closer to matter, mathematics is farther from matter, and philosophy is even farther from matter. Some people think that philosophy is too mysterious and not practical. In fact, what they call mysterious and impractical is because the form sought by philosophy is relatively far from matter. But everyone knows that the efforts of all learning in the world lie in seeking form, as long as it is based directly or indirectly on matter, and not arbitrarily conceived out of thin air. The form in philosophy is indirectly obtained based on matter, and we cannot blame it - this is one aspect. And the more advanced human culture is, the more everything learning is inclined towards the abstract, that is, the form sought by all learning is farther from matter. The most developed branch of learning now—such as astronomy and physics—uses so much mathematics and is getting closer and closer to mathematics. This is good evidence. Why do people dislike philosophy for being mysterious, why not further dislike mathematics for being mysterious, and further dislike astronomy and physics for being mysterious? Carried to the extreme, it will inevitably lead to disliking all learning for being mysterious, and reverting to the primitive state of ignorance, what is the point of this? This is another aspect.

<h3 id="e134">Debates in American Educational Philosophy <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>Recently, a debate has emerged in American educational circles regarding educational philosophy or ideals. This debate is not purely abstract or theoretical but is related to practice, as they seek immediate reforms to current educational policies. Therefore, the various arguments within the debate are not castles in the air but have already seen some degree of practical implementation. The author believes this debate warrants our attention, and a brief report on its content follows.</p>
<p>From this debate, we can discern three major schools of thought in American educational trends. These three schools are: first, the "Great Books" curriculum, represented by President Hutchins of the University of Chicago; second, the experimental method school, represented by Professor Sidney Hook of New York University, author of "Education for Modern Man"; and third, the eclectic school, represented by the Harvard University report titled "General Education in a Free Society." The first school is somewhat conservative, the second somewhat progressive, and the third seeks a compromise between the old and the new.</p>
<p>According to the educational ideal of the first school, the fundamental nature of humanity is to know. From the knowing nature of humanity, we can deduce the education humans need. Furthermore, although human characteristics may differ slightly depending on time and place, their fundamental nature remains unchanged. Therefore, we can discover a type throughout human history. Using this type can help us understand the present and indicate the future. For the values people hold have an eternal and objective existence. These values are contained in the works of many great figures of the past and passed down to us. We only need to read the works of these great figures to understand and accept these absolute values and truths as the sole reliable guide for our beliefs and behaviors. Therefore, this school advocates that the university curriculum can be limited to a hundred great books. St. John's College in the United States has already implemented this plan.</p>
<p>The educational ideal of the second school opposes the first. This school believes that the arguments of the previous school are too biased towards tradition and authority. Humans do not live in a vacuum but in an environment. The relationship between humans and the environment can be changed. These relationships vary with time and place, so the answers to past problems are not necessarily correct for the present. Humans must use their intelligence to solve their problems. The answers to past problems and traditional values are merely a set of factors to consider when solving problems. The method of dealing with problems should be scientific and experimental. Education should focus on training students to use this method, but there is no single curriculum content to learn. Relying on this experimental method is the hallmark of a democratic polity.</p>
<p>The third school seeks a compromise between the first two, seeking a middle ground. This school, unlike the first, does not advocate for a so-called unchanging fundamental human nature, but seeks to find some common beliefs of humanity as the basis for educational policies. This school believes that some common ground can be found in the tradition of Western culture, and that this tradition contains beliefs that need to be changed. On the one hand, there are unchanging things, and on the other hand, there are things that should be changed; on the one hand, there should be similarities, and on the other hand, there should be differences. Therefore, this school advocates that the university curriculum can provide a common core on the one hand, and cater to the different needs of students on the other. We should train students to have the ability to distinguish values, but we do not need to force students to accept certain values.</p>
<p>Which of the above three schools of thought is correct is not for the author to decide. What the author can suggest is that debates like this in the United States have long existed in our country. The first school can be said to be the classicists, the second the New Culture school, and the third also an eclectic school. Although we do not discuss these issues much now, these issues still exist. Perhaps it is time to re-discuss these issues.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Gleanings from the Academic World (24) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Weng Wenhao on American and Soviet Political Thought</p>
<p>Mr. Weng Wenhao, the newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, recently published an article in the "Thought and Era" monthly magazine entitled "The Conflict Between American and Soviet Political Thought," indicating the direction China should take in national construction. A brief summary is provided for readers. (The original article is published in the 52nd issue of the magazine, priced at 50,000 yuan per copy. Those interested in purchasing can directly contact the editorial office via National Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.)</p>
<p>Political systems originate from political thought. Different thoughts lead to changes in systems. Unfortunately, after this World War, two fundamentally different ideas are clashing and fighting. The current situation is one of "two major powers in contention," and China is naturally threatened by the ripples.</p>
<p>American thought actually originates from Europe, including countries such as England, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy. Even Germany before the Nazi Party came to power, Czechoslovakia before it was controlled by the Soviet Union, and Sweden and Denmark, which are striving to support it, are all on the same track. For the sake of simplification, America is used as a representative name.</p>
<p>In this thought, the first basic principle is human rights. Everyone recognizes that every citizen has the innate right to freedom of thought and action. This is sacred and supreme and cannot be deprived. The second is civil rights. What are civil rights? The government and all institutions are established for the benefit of all citizens. If they violate the interests of the citizens, they have no reason to exist. The third is the national foundation. The existence of the country is a necessary condition for the survival and development of all citizens. All efforts must be made to protect and consolidate it, and no loss can be tolerated. The above three points are the essence of modern political thought and the foundation of democratic politics. Many countries have repeatedly reformed and struggled to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>China's modern political thought also stems entirely from this thought. Based on this thought, the imperial system was overthrown, the Republic of China was established, and the backward warlords and politicians were overthrown, creating a government based on the Three Principles of the People for national construction. It is also because of this thought that all citizens vote to elect and establish a constitutional government that respects civil rights. Although progress has been gradual over the decades, the efficiency is too low, even insufficient, but in general, the overall direction is towards the path of democracy.</p>
<p>Soviet thought openly accuses the politics of countries like America and England as fake democracy and backward systems, without any reservations. This is noteworthy. The government produced by American-style democratic thought must have multiple parties coexisting in its legislative body. The party with more votes can govern because of popular elections, but parties with fewer votes can at least maintain the status of a minority party in the legislative body, monitor the actions of the majority party, express opposing views, and enable the national public to recognize the truth of the matter. This state is considered by American thought to be a necessary condition for a democratic system. In the Soviet constitution, although there is no explicit provision for one-party rule, in fact, there is no participation of any other party besides the Communist Party. Therefore, despite advocating for true democracy, for the collective action of the masses, in reality, the Soviet regime has no possibility of legally changing or discussing with various parties. Soviet politicians have defended this point, saying that it is not that other parties are not allowed, but that the history of the Soviet Union and the Soviet system have completely eliminated all bourgeois prejudices. This statement, of course, runs counter to American democracy.</p>
<p>The political system and thought of the Soviet Union are termed totalitarianism by the English and Americans, similar in nature to the fascism of Italy and the Nazism of Germany before the war. It is believed that there can be no true democratic politics in countries that practice totalitarianism, and that because this kind of politics centers on the glory and achievements of a few powerful figures, it is bound to be insatiable and become an aggressive country that constantly expands outward. Therefore, it is believed that the reason why the world has failed to achieve true peace after the Second World War and why countries still need to deploy large amounts of arms is mainly due to the poor political system in the Soviet Union and its endless ambition abroad.</p>
<p>In this situation of two major powers in contention, China's position, situated in between, is bound to be affected, resulting in psychological turmoil, divergent thoughts, and local chaos. On the one hand, the central government, in accordance with its historical policy of implementing constitutionalism, is returning power to the people and implementing policies in the American way. On the other hand, the Communist Party, based on the doctrines transmitted by the Soviet Union and advocating for New Democracy, is destroying the established order, breaking away from the historical chain, and igniting the flames of war, leaving the people destitute. The causal relationship between the ideological conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union and the political chaos in China is very clear.</p>
<p>In this situation, if our country wants to achieve political stability, it must rely on psychological calmness and ideological clarification. We should emulate the Soviet Union's spirit of active construction and rapid recovery, but its political thought and system are truly different, forming a unique style. It is neither the norm of democratic politics derived from modern evolution, nor is it the path that China should take at this time. China's national construction plan must have foresight, see clearly the trend of history, and understand the actual situation in order to properly determine what to adopt and what to discard, and determine the direction to take. Once the direction is set, we should work together and move forward, so as not to go astray or end up in tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Beijing School <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yu</p>
<p>The old painter Feng Zikai bowing down before the "skirt" of the King of Opera Mei makes me feel like a victory for the Beijing School. As a Northerner, I am proud of it.</p>
<p>However, the distinction between Beijing and Shanghai originally had nothing to do with birthplace. For example, Dr. Mei is from Taizhou. Mr. Xu Lingyu once referred to him as Mei Taizhou, and believed that he should be ranked alongside Xu Donghai as one of the great figures of modern Wu. If this is the case, then can Mr. Mei be considered a Shanghai School artist? The Beijing School is influenced by the old culture, does not break away from the traditional style, like those who study the classics with a family tradition, and can absorb the strengths of others to digest and nourish their talent. It's a long story, so let's start with a small example, and it also has something to do with the Shanghai School art master Dr. Mei, which can be said to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>I often oppose radio in my writing, especially popular songs and difficult-to-hear jazz Western music. As for the extremely vicious advertisements, which, as the ancients said, "break into the door directly," I can't stand them even more. But recently, Mr. Mei's performances, since I don't have the money to buy tickets, and I don't have the interest in making strange noises and cheering along with others, a friend lent me a radio, and I listened to it all day long. Dr. Mei is called the King of Opera, but he is old, and his voice has an unavoidable dryness. The beauty is late, how can she not be saddened! Thinking back to the time when I listened to operas in Zhonghe Garden in Beijing, I was just a junior high school student, jumping around, not caring at all, while Dr. Mei's graceful demeanor was like a fairy on Miaogu She Mountain. Later, during a charity performance at the First Stage, there were those who came from Tianjin and Tanggu, hundreds of miles away, and even put their luggage in the theater in advance, sleeping and eating there, in order to buy good tickets. How can this kind of grand occasion be seen by today's people! There is no need to repeat these things, I will only introduce the radio announcer who broadcasted Mei's opera. Although she also interspersed reports on a certain brand of wool, she spoke entirely in the gentle tone of the Beijing court, and her main task was to report the plot and tune, combining the strengths of "explaining the opera" and "telling the story," using professional terms to explain the types of tunes, and also mentioning the origin of the performances (such as the fact that "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest" was once taboo because "Phoenix" sounds the same as "Feng," which means to offer [to the emperor]), it was really pleasant to listen to, and made people feel no fatigue. I remember that Mr. Xu Lanyuan, the qin player of the former Mei Opera Troupe, told stories on the Beijing radio, which were delicate and winding, fascinating. Although this lady cannot be compared with him, in the wave of the Shanghai School, she is no less than a refreshing and sobering agent. (Editor's note: Ms. Zhiqing explained when Mei's opera was broadcast.)</p>
<p>Originally, the distinction between Beijing and Shanghai originated in drama. The Shanghai School emphasizes craftsmanship and is close to fire, while the Beijing School emphasizes rules and singing and is close to warmth. Now, they are often mixed together, neither fiery nor warm, both fiery and warm, and even turned into a hybrid, such as the popular Eighteen Arhats subduing Dapeng and opera fans spinning cotton in their homes. The true Beijing School should cry bitterly for this, and the true Shanghai School (such as Zhou Xinfang) would also disdain this. Isn't it impossible to please either side? Measuring Chinese culture by this standard can often be viewed in this way. The sign of neither Chinese nor Western, the houses of neither native nor foreign, the paintings of both Chinese and Western, the articles of both Chinese and Western, are all things that can make people unhappy, just like serving Western steak with Chinese porridge, it is not very comfortable to eat, or it is not even steak, it is simply stinky tofu dried radish with tomatoes!</p>
<p>As early as before the war, around 1933, there was a debate between Beijing and Shanghai writers. The issue was raised by Shen Congwen, Ba Jin, and others. Those who launched a revolution in literature and art were from the North, which was extremely feudalistic, while those who advocated conservatism were from the South, reaching as far as Guangzhou, Kowloon, Hong Kong, and Macao. This seems strange, but in fact, the South was the base of the imperialists, and it was no accident that they rejected new ideas. But later, the South developed into both the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School and the revolutionary school, while the literary atmosphere in the North transformed into academic research. Literature, history, and social sciences all took a new scientific path in the North. In particular, in the fields of literature and history, a large amount of Western scientific thought permeated the Qing people's textual research methods, almost completely changing the tradition of two thousand years, and its influence on modern culture is indeed not small. At the same time, in Shanghai, the center of the Shanghai School, there still gathered flows of Jinshi graduates and Hanlin scholars, lecturing on Tongcheng prose and Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism, which is an immeasurable distance away. This is something that the Northerners did not expect.</p>
<p>Those who are good at preserving tradition are creative, adding new human labor on the old side base or in the old hall, so that it is new even though it is old. Those who are not good at preserving tradition are only waiting for the rabbit by the tree, until the halls and pavilions collapse and are destroyed, and then they cry and sigh and leave. Dr. Mei's opera studies, whether in terms of endowment or skill, all come from a family tradition, but in improving Peking Opera, he also absorbed the strengths of modern drama (note that this is not an incongruous, neither Chinese nor Western, Western-style facade improvement, but a harmonious, Chinese-oriented improvement). Therefore, he was able to make a name for himself in Europe and the United States and revitalize the national opera. This is the tactic of defending by attacking in military strategy, which is a characteristic of the Beijing School preserving tradition. Looking back at literature and art, it is mostly the same. Even an advertising announcer knows this trend of improvement, because they have taken the essence from history and made great use of it, and have also opened up communication between China and foreign countries in terms of geography, so their special achievements are very different from those with shallow foundations who regard ordinary stones as beautiful jade.</p>
<h3 id="e139">A Hundred Billion Yuan for a Smile <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Kai</p>
<p>In the past, our country had the saying "a thousand gold for a smile," but now that times have advanced, it takes a hundred billion yuan for a smile.</p>
<p>The origin of "a hundred billion yuan for a smile" is a recent real event in the United States: A family's electrical wire was broken and they refused to repair it. So, on a night of wind and rain, this broken wire hung down by the side of the road. A child happened to walk by, and his face touched the wire. He was immediately electrocuted and injured, and passed out.</p>
<p>The child was sent to the hospital and treated for several months, and finally recovered from his injuries. His parents hired a lawyer for him and demanded that the family who refused to repair the wire compensate for the losses.</p>
<p>In court, the lawyer suddenly called the child to face the jurors in the court. The lawyer said, "Child, smile!"</p>
<p>The child tried hard to smile, but—only half of his face showed a smile, while the other half had been burned like ham that day when he was electrocuted, revealing only a few deep, ugly wrinkles.</p>
<p>The jurors only deliberated for a few minutes and immediately ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff damages of $20,000.</p>
<p>This $20,000 is the price of that poor child's smile. Regardless of the value of the black market exchange rate, even according to the statutory purchase price, isn't the value of this smile close to 100 billion yuan?</p>
<h3 id="e140">Autobiography of a Train Porter <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>I am a train porter in a first-class carriage, and I have been taking care of passengers on trains for forty-three years. In the past, what you had to worry about on the train was the passengers' health, opening and closing windows, and wiping away dust for the passengers after a dusty journey...etc. But now that there is air conditioning, there is no need to "wipe the dust." Today, the first duty of a train porter is to make you feel comfortable and help you enjoy this journey.</p>
<p>Because the train equipment is now advanced, the responsibilities of a train porter can be reduced a lot. In fact, there are still many places where he can be of service, especially in times of crisis. There is a first-class carriage called "Daniel" because a train porter named Daniel saved many lives in a train accident. That is why this carriage is called "Daniel." Originally, the train head crashed into this carriage, but Daniel risked his life to close the car door to prevent steam from entering.</p>
<p>Disputes in the car, such as domestic quarrels, are not something that the train porter should advise on, but sometimes when you see that a couple is getting more and more rigid, the best way is still to boldly ask about their trouble. The most troublesome thing on the journey is quarreling. Once a young couple came on the train. They had only been married for three months. Because the woman went to another carriage to find a friend and sat and talked for two hours, the husband quarreled with her loudly when she came back. Later, she threatened to go home when the train stopped at the next stop.</p>
<p>"That's a good idea!" the husband said, "I think this is going back to your house..."</p>
<p>"Don't do that," I said to her. We recognized the two of them, and also recognized their parents and friends, who brought flowers to the station to see them off. I pulled the man aside, and said to him like an uncle, "If your wife goes back alone, it will make your parents and her parents sad, and the friends who see them off, and the people who come to meet them in New Orleans, will be disappointed. They specially came to me to ask me to take care of you during the journey. Therefore, I will lock your luggage and refuse to open the car door at the next stop. When you are in the lounge, you can let you quarrel all night.</p>
<p>The next morning, they ran out smiling. Now they are a happy pair of grandparents. I sometimes think, if I hadn't intervened, I don't know where the two of them would have separated.</p>
<p>What makes the train porter most headache is looking for lost items on the train. Once, on a train to Minneapolis, at four o'clock in the morning, a panicked old woman ran to tell me that her wife had lost a diamond ring. I knew she had gotten up in the middle of the night, so I went to the dressing room to look for it. But there was nothing. I noticed that one of the two women in the lower berth No. 10 also got up in the middle of the night. An idea popped into my head, and I "squeezed" out a "clue."</p>
<p>No matter who took the diamond ring, it is not convenient to admit it now, because she did not report it immediately when she got the diamond ring. I decided to let her surrender automatically, in order to respect her personality. I stood in front of the lower berth No. 10, shouting as if I was talking to the old couple: "It's okay, the conductor has telegraphed to the police station at the next stop. This carriage will be sealed off for a full inspection when it arrives." So I ran to the smoking room and waited. Not long after, the bell in the lower berth No. 10 rang, and the woman said that she found the ring in the dressing room, "but I don't know what to do!"</p>

<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Most people are too bad to be good people, and too good to be bad people. —Therefore, in this world, there are few truly bad and good people, just like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>Don't plant roses, tuberoses, and violets in the peony garden, although they are all very fragrant and beautiful. But one kind is enough.</p>
<p>A rotten apple will not make the apple tree rotten, but a rotten apple tree cannot bear fruit.</p>
<p>Life is an endless heavy burden: there are many visible burdens of life, and many invisible burdens of emotion. Just looking at the tombstones among the weeds and poplars, there is still such a heavy burden even after death;——you can still get rid of it.</p>
<p>The clearly remembered happiness, even more clearly, is like looking through a veil; the forgotten sorrows, even if they are forgotten cleanly, will still suspect that it is a clear shadow in a sigh.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Record of the "Peace Flower" <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>On May 20th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Palace Museum in Beiping held a large garden party to entertain Chinese and foreign dignitaries, all because the "Peace Flower" in the Imperial Garden was in full bloom. Many photos were taken at that time, and the term "Peace Flower" caused quite a sensation. However, it was not easy to see elsewhere. Some people said: this is a specialty of the palace, and it cannot be transplanted; if it is transplanted, it will not grow. According to what is said in ancient books, like the "Brief Records of Products of Yi Province": "The Auspicious Saint Flower comes from the mountains of Qingcheng. The trunk is not striped, and the tall ones are several fathoms high. The flowers usually bloom in autumn, with four petals like peach blossoms, but dozens are combined into one flower, densely packed like being sewn together, blooming one after another, with new buds opening and old ones not yet withered. The people of Shu call it the Abundant Auspicious Flower. Therefore, Minister Cheng drew a picture to report it, and it was renamed the Auspicious Saint Flower. However, there are several kinds, the small ones are called Precious Immortals, the light red ones are called Drunken Peace, and the white ones are named Jade Truth. The people of Chengdu compete to transplant them into their gardens, considering them a special delight." Gao Shiqi's "Remaining Knowledge of Heavenly Prosperity": "The Peace Flower is from Jiannan, Sichuan. It resembles a peach with four petals, with hundreds or thousands of buds clustered together to form a flower. During the Tiansheng era of the Song Dynasty, it was presented to the capital, and Emperor Renzong named it the Peace Flower. (The annotations on the poems of Jiannan are similar, except that the name given was the Peace Auspicious Saint Flower instead of Peace Flower.)" According to the above two statements, it is a product of Sichuan, but later generations regarded it as something special to the imperial palace. The Northern Song Dynasty established its capital in Henan, but I don't know when it was moved to Beijing? Then the saying "it will not grow if transplanted" is unreliable. The "Brief Records of Products of Yidu" says "the flowers usually bloom in autumn," but the garden party at the Palace Museum was held in May, so the time of blooming becomes a problem. Song Fan Chengda's poem on the Peace Auspicious Saint Flower: "Holding onto spring and living into summer, watching the fire star flow westward." This can prove that it does bloom in early summer. In the garden of Qiu at the Hualong Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in this city, there is a tree with white flowers, all with four petals, and occasionally five petals, with a slight fragrance. At first glance, it doesn't seem special, but upon careful examination, there are some unique features. The flowers are commonly called "Foreign Begonias." One day, Dr. He Shixi broke off a branch and inserted it into a vase, but no one recognized its true name. The old actor Wei Miaokan, an expert in growing flowers, having cultivated seventy or eighty kinds of exotic flowers, said: This is the "Peace Flower"! Comparing it to the photos from the Palace Museum, it is exactly right, precisely "hundreds or thousands of buds clustered together to form a flower," and also "blooming one after another, with new buds opening and old ones not yet withered," a kind called "Jade Truth." Investigating its origin, it was originally bought as a potted landscape from a flower shop, and later gradually grew larger and was transplanted to the ground, only two or three years ago. Although it hasn't reached "several fathoms high," it is already five or six feet tall. Dr. He is taking photos of it and writing poems about it, which is indeed an excellent source of poetic inspiration. The Peace Flower, a symbol of peace, has had its true identity buried for several years because the world points at a deer and calls it a horse. Now is the time for it to come into its own, right?</p>

<p>Since entering summer, the climate has been , and the body is unable to resist, often suffering from dizziness and weakness, unable to go out, and sleeping often. When awake, I browse Qu Yuan's Collected Works to slightly break the silence, and I often have thoughts about humanity, nature, and myself. Yu Yue lectured at Jiangzhe academies for decades, serving as the elder statesman of literature in the southeast. His writings are vast and his language is classical and elegant, especially in poetry, following the style of Xiangshan, not aiming for high antiquity, but naturally elegant and rhythmic, fully expressing his intentions and emotions. His late-year works on old age are all real and true. When young people read them, they may not be able to understand them, but as old age approaches and signs of decline increase, after repeated contemplation, they feel that every word is spoken for me, but I am ashamed of not having the old man's gentle and sincere writing style. For example, he said: "Before old age, youth has already declined early, let alone this year, old age is even more declining and weak. Sparse teeth have long abandoned the toothpick, and numb bones frequently use the back-tapping mallet. When sitting, one must lean on a long pillow, and when standing, one must rely on a short crutch. I was like this at seventy, not believing that there is senility in the world." I have not reached seventy but have suffered from stomach ailments for many years, and I dare not eat my fill at every meal. However, in the year of victory, I was still able to eat one steamed bun or one bowl of rice, but in the past two years, my teeth have gradually fallen out. Every time a tooth falls out, the adjacent one will become loose and follow, once, twice, three times, until now, only three remain on the upper and lower gums, completely useless. Not only are the teeth sparse, but they are also completely gone—reading further, "In the morning, avoid meat and eat white porridge, in the evening, prevent thinning and sip black tea," and "Accumulated phlegm becomes drink and frequent sour vomiting," everything coincides with my current situation. Because of toothlessness, I can only eat thin porridge; because of a weak stomach, I often vomit after eating a little more. And sitting requires a chair, and walking requires a cane, which has been the case for some time now. The old man also said: "Living alone deeply suffers from indigestion, and I also fear the clamor of numerous guests and friends. Remembering childhood feels recent, and even thinking of outside the door feels distant." Indeed, in youth, passing a month is just passing a month, and passing a year is just passing a year, and the length and duration of years, months, days, and hours are clearly distinguished. In old age, with a slight recollection, everything seems like yesterday. This kind of feeling cannot be fully understood without reaching this kind of state. I also recall that Mr. Yan Fansun's elegiac poem from the year of Ji Si said: "I used to say that youth is hard to age, who knew that white hair would urge people on!" These are also sentences where the feeling is true because the situation is real. In my decades of life, I have either taught or written manuscripts. Of the national and private schools in Beiping, those with whom I have the relationship of guest and host account for six or seven tenths; of the newspapers in Shanghai, Ningbo, Tianjin, and Beiping, those with whom I have literary exchanges also account for seven or eight tenths. Pouring my heart and soul out of my wrist, I have written countless words (now it should be said "billions" of words)! Those who used to write at the same time have either changed careers or passed away, but I am still using this writing brush (not used to fountain pens), still bent over my desk, so the various states of decline are not unexpected. I have gray hair and missing teeth, eat little and am often sick, and prolonging life with illness has not been just for a day. I usually pay no attention to the length of life, and I feel that the old sayings about wealth, honor, and longevity are clichés, but I also feel that being passively world-weary and chanting sutras is unnecessary. I let nature take its course. Qu Yuan's old man said that he viewed life and death like traveling to and from Suzhou and Hangzhou, which is very true. As for his lines "Red dust easily ages the soaring crane" and "It is difficult to keep the white sun from going to the firm snake," they are precisely the words to write on my desk.</p>
