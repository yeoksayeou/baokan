<h3>匪軍黃梁一夢入川渡江成空　川鄂聯防日趨具體</h3>
<p>〔本報宜昌廿二日電〕記者曾就共匪所宣傳之入川及渡江計劃，分別徵詢鄂西鄂北各地軍政首長之意見。一般判斷，在目前中原國軍正以革新之佈署淸剿殘匪之下，共匪在打算上決不致分散兵力，另闢流竄地區，且論其本身實力，亦決不許可。自江漢地區間國軍對襄河沿岸殘匪予以嚴重之打擊，並澈底破壞其倉庫工廠以及匪積存之物資後，江漢間殘匪如李人林·李震乾等主要匪股，均已渡襄河或繞道遁入大洪山區，在今冬長江水枯之際，江防已無多大顧慮，匪入川迷夢，在劉匪方而始終蜷伏於豫南方城附近，國軍已在平漢綫之漯河，信陽以及南陽·襄陽等處佈置强大兵團，殘匪蠢動為難。陜境孔匪方面，在出川部隊北進幷越漢水追擊下，已狼狽向東北流竄。鄂西北地區亦僅有少數散匪，潛伏於鄭陽·房縣·南　附近，實力脆弱，難期大舉，川防安如磐石。惟據記者在襄陽獲悉，匪在均縣附近設有大規模之幹訓班，專收集川陝幹部，並就川省之歷史·地理·風土·民情及一般社會組織各方面知識，詳密灌輸，其組織之大，敎程之嚴，均足顯示共匪對入川之夢一時尙難打消，而此項消息亦殊足資軍政各界及社會人士之警惕。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿二日電〕川鄂聯防日趨具體，朱紹良特派范誦堯參謀長，廿三日自渝飛漢，晋謁白崇禧總司令。</p>

<h3>民衆疾苦固應顧慮當前國策尤須貫澈</h3>
<p>白崇禧談徵兵徵糧問題</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿二日電〕白總司令崇禧，頃就徵兵徵糧問題，再度發表談話稱：總體戰之目的，在求足食足兵，爭取最後勝利，而少數人竟以减免徵兵徽糧為其個人政治活動之號召，殊足影響剿匪前途。白氏列舉抗戰期中，，西南各省每年徵實徵購總額為四千五百萬担，而四川一省卽可擔負二千四百萬石，供養五百萬大軍；今抗戰勝利，洞庭。鄱陽。太湖·巢湖等一切產糧地區，均為我掌握，而軍糧民食尙慮缺乏，寗非反常現象？白氏再三强調民衆艱苦固應顧慮，而當前國策尤應貫澈，切盼民意機關協助徵實進行，共策戡亂成功。</p>
<h3>馬拿馬新總統就任我派鄭震宇為賀使</h3>

<h3>整理外幣國幣公債辦法　立委提出修正案　明日立院例會進行討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院定廿四日晨九時舉行第二會期第五次例會，先開秘密會，聽取（一）行政院長·國防部長·參謀總長關於濟南戰况及派兵援救情形，（二）行政院長關於政府對第三屆聯合國大會所採取方策之報告及答覆，並討論劃定中緬未定國界密案。然後接開例愈，議程中規定之討論事項有：（一）繼續討輪農地改革法案，（二）修正政院公布之整理外幣與國幣公債辦法案，（三）確定本院委員提案處理辦法原則案，（四）救濟各省水災災民及减免災區田賦案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立委劉振東等八十八人，頃向立院提議修正政院公布之整理外幣與國幣公債辦法，以彰公道，而减輕國庫負担案，立院將於廿四日例會中提出討論。該案指陳：政院根據財政經濟緊急處分令公布之整理公債辦法，對外幣（美金）公債掉換比率特別優厚，在改幣前夕，市價平均每元價値為四十餘萬元法幣，一夕之後，改為折合法幣一千二百萬元償付，而國幣（法幣）公債掉換率，最高而為二萬七千倍，卽國幣三萬元之公債，祗付償金圓一分，遠不如外幣公債之優厚，顯失事理之公平，無怪興論譁然，指責百出。該案並謂：戡亂期間，政府財政困難，國幣公債照市價收回或掉換，原無不可，惟對外幣公債優厚償付，無端增加國庫鉅額負担，政府必須重行考慮兼顧外幣，國幣公債償付之公平，因提供兩項辦法：（一）由立院決議咨請政院，另擬公平合理之償還外幣與國幣公債辦法，送院審議。（二）原定整理外幣與國幣公債辦法，着卽廢止，俟新辦法由立院通過後，再行辦理外幣與國幣公債之償付手續。</p>

<h3>善處流亡學生的問題</h3>
<p>近來各地流亡學生時起風潮，而尤以南京為甚。學生流亡，興盛於抗戰時期，蔓延於戡亂今日。這是我們忠實的下一代，必須好好處理。抗戰八年，後方流亡學生不下百萬，幸而當時中央敎育當局，深知「牧民之道，務在安之而已，」撥鉅款，用大力，設站招收，設校敎導，有政策，有辦法，頭頭是道，順序進行，各得其所，民族文化所擊靑年命脈所恃的庫序之敎，亦得以按步就班，宛若平時。雖有一部份人士批評當時的敎育不免粗製濫造，重量而輕質，但由今思之，國家大難方作，而絃歌不輟，學潮不起，究屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>抗戰時的流亡學生所以能安心向學，不鬧亂子，理由甚多。敎育部領導有方，安排有所，辦事人員大率公忠體國，仰體上意，撫慰下情，此其一。對敵作戰，人人有恨無怨，每個學生雖生存在一個十足的難民境地之中，却都憧憬着一幅美麗的遠景，希望國家翻身，大家能過「人」的日子，在心理上早有吃苦的準備，故對種種不合理的事態，差能容忍，千辛萬苦，甘之如飴，此其二。天下大患，在不均而不在寡，那時大家都窮都苦，官民師生一樣生活，不均的地方還不多，縱有發國難財的貪官奸商，為數究少，不平之心自减，此其三。有此三原因，太平渡過難關。</p>
<p>經過千災百難，越過了亡國綫，眼見國土重光，河山再造。誰知勝利之神帶來了更可哀的命運！舊傷未愈，新痛曼來，共匪叛亂，十室九空。家家哭，戶哭，人人哭！好一片光復河山，竟描畫得如此慘痛！</p>
<p>東北告急，千萬學生緊張得被擠在絕望的角落裏。他們含辛茹苦，跋涉入關，想投入政府懷抱裏得些溫暖。誰知一入關內，四處掽璧，飢不得食，寒不得衣，　論讀書？他們每期待一天，便多一分失望，便多一分與飢寒·疾病·死亡接近，而卒造成北平「七五」慘案。我們不願論究「七五」事件的資任，但不能不問：流亡學生的敎養，在北平究由何人負責。監察大員對此重點，會有一字提及否？</p>
<p>開封一失，中原吿急，山東會戰，徐州吃緊，又是千萬學生無家可歸，無校可讀。他們還過着戰時生活，生活浸透了眼淚。他們抱着悲傷與情慨的心情，半走半爬的逃到首都。而敎育當局驟無準備，學生全無生路。他們對漫漫長夜感覺痛苦，失望，頹廢，焦急，垂頭喪氣，徬徨無主。於是一面自組乞食隊，沿門托缽，而豪富巨賈，為富不仁，一毛不拔。又因上次學生冒名索捐，信用已失，所獲稀微，一面要求救濟，包圍敎部，一時敎部頓成難民棄，窮人脾氣大，不免有血氣之舉，弄得極為難堪。「人懷自危之心，親處窮苦之實，咸不安其位，故易動也。」這豈是偶然之事。</p>
<p>敎部最初每人每日發給救濟金六十萬法幣，戔戔之數，只能買大餅六塊，不够一日之飽，而政府憑空每天要添支四十八億，亦屬差强。如今改發每人每月白米三斗，每日副食金八十萬，分住京市市立中小學，校長會同部派專員負責照料，敎部召集負責人會議，朱部長重視此事，親駕指導，愛護靑年備至，流亡學生才吿平息。詎料學生們飽暖思觀劇，無錢打戲院，九月七日，國民大戲院因拒絕看白戲被搗毀，釀成全市戯院罷業。平日成羣結隊，打公共汽車，打米店，打老虎灶，京報載二個月來大小全武行竟達五十除次，而前天與雜貨店衝突，　成慘案，昨天又搗毀中國日報，好像他們因為無書可讀，英雄只好另尋用武之地了。</p>
<p>如今首都的流亡學生，十九是中學程麾：有的年齡小的使你不會相信是中學生，有的年齡大到三十光景也自稱中學生，甚至舉業後已在社會上做事數年了也還在稱學生。如此魚龍混雜，自或不免夾着其他份子。有的已經回了魯豫老家，因無飯吃而又折回南京，聽說還有許多人要南來。現正金風送爽的時節，不久西風快要緊起來，一席一褲是抵抗不住冷氣的襲擊，流浪遠方，瑟縮異地，長久的失學總不是道理！</p>
<p>眼看戰爭非短期內能結束，戰爭愈延長，戰區愈擴大，流亡學生一定愈充斥，這倒不是一個小問題，怎能輕描淡寫的等閒視之？尤其是我們看到最近公佈一年來職業學生有計劃的煽動各地學潮，深感這個流亡學生問題，正是他們有隙可乘的機會，敎育當局措置適當與否實有關目前國家的治亂。明知　業學生今天正想利用靑年製造學潮，製造慘案，內而破壞治安，外而影響國際，為什麽還給他們以「隙」的可雜？這豈非反映政府的能力！</p>
<p>假使敎育當局有勇氣正視現實，並有勇氣改進一現實，相信這些現象的改變，不特對靑年敎育有大貢獻，對國家安定也有大功勞·目前敎郡已訂了幾種辦法，但學生不肯離京。我們以為安全地帶學生，應儘速回去，免費入學，恢復學籍；戰區以及非戰區而有危險性的地帶各種學校應儘速遷地為良，實行公費制度。其實學校應生產化，戰前日本小學已如此做了，何况非常時期的中學以上學生？同時學生們應體念時艱，人人以國士自期，萬萬不作盲目行動。</p>
<p>深盼政府多盡力，社會多注意，學生多守規。「安民可與行義，而危民易於為非。」祈大家思之，深思之！</p>

<h3>解決巴勒斯坦阿猶紛爭　貝那多特建議全文　阿猶分治確立永久和平</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二十二日電〕員那多特報吿之結論全文如下：「余目六月廿七日向阿拉伯及猶太當局遞達書面建議後，卽未向雙方正式提出任何有關解決問題之確實建議。自該時期起，余曾與雙方在阿拉伯首府及台拉維夫作多次會談，會談中，曾就解決爭端辦法，自由交換意見。余所提之原來建議係提供一般性之範圍，苟雙方願從事協商，則可在此範圍內，覓致一合理可予實行之解決方法。然雙方對此建議均拒不接受，當提出此建議時，明知此項建議純係試探性質，其主要目的為藉此徵詢雙方之意向及其建議，且無論如何，此項建議之實現，必須獲得變方之同意，是以余從未使用壓力，促其實現。余對建議中之某基本觀念，認識甚淸。不論巴勒斯坦之政治及經濟聯盟為如何之必要，此種計劃之實現時機尙未到來。余並無職權向聯合國會員國解決巴勒斯坦問題之任何行動，余認為本人無權向聯合國會員國提出建議。此乃會員國經由適當機構應負之責任。余現任聯合國調解專員，當應覓取資料並自經驗中獲得結論，此對聯合國會員國決定有關巴勒斯坦問題之行動時，不無助益。職是之故，余之職責，厥為促使聯合國會員國自此項報吿中獲悉若干和平解決方法之內容，此項辦法之擬定，係根據過去三個半月中與阿猶當局經常之會商，以及本人對目前巴勒斯坦局勢之觀感。余並不認為：此項結論可作為建議之基礎，而立卽獲得有關雙方之同意。余在求取阿猶共同協議之積極努力中，尙未能擾定此一計劃。余深信：在此時提出之建議如能由大會採納並予以堅强之支持，則阿猶雙方將不致堅決拒絕。余又深信：安理會將堅持其七月十五日雙方停止軍事行動之決議。茲有一點，不容忽視，此卽目前與去年十一月情形已大不相同，在此數月中戰爭開始，旋又中止而具有決定性之事件亦曾在此時期發生·余之結論基於如下七種基本前提：</p>
<p>恢復和平　（A）巴勒斯坦必須恢復和平，並應採取各種可能實行之措施，確保戰爭不再重起，而阿拉伯與猶太之間終於恢復和諧之關係。</p>
<p>猶太國　（B）名為以色列之猶太國存在於巴勒斯坦，並無健全理由可假定其將不繼續存在。</p>
<p>疆界確定　（C）此一新國之疆界必須由有關之雙方以正式協定，作最後之確定，否則須由聯合國予以決定。</p>
<p>延續之邊界　（D）疆界協定之主要目標應為遵守地理統一與完整之原則，此項原則應同等施用於阿拉伯及猶太之領土，因此，該兩國之領土不應受九月二十九日決議案中所規定領土協議之嚴格管制。</p>
<p>遣送權利　（E）因受目下戰爭之恐怖與蹂躪猶所離鄕背井之無事人民，應有遣送回鄕之權利，其不願回鄕者，應保證其所損失之財產，可得適當之賠償。</p>
<p>耶路撒冷　（F）耶路撒冷城，由於其在宗敎與國際」之重要性，及其中各項利益之複雜性，應予以另外特別之處理。</p>
<p>國際責任　（G）國際之責任，必要時應以國際保障方式表示之，藉以緩和現有之恐懼，尤其關於邊界及人權方面者。</p>
<p>肯定之結論　以下各項之結論係屬廣泛之大綱。根據本人之見解，認為此等結論，就全文情形而論，足以提供一項合理，公允且可予以實施之解決基礎：（A）由於安理會根據憲章第八章有關制裁之規定，已禁止再在巴勒斯坦境內使用武力作為解決爭端之辦法之故，有關雙方應根據相互同意之方式正式宣佈衝突結果，不然，則應由聯合國正式加以宣佈。現行之無限期停戰應代之以正式和平，至少限度，亦應代之以休戰，此項停戰應規定武裝部隊之完全撤退及復員，或則在聯合國監督之下成立廣闊之非軍事地帶，作為隔離。（B）阿拉伯與猶太領土間之界綫在阿猶之間未有協定成立之時，應由聯合國加以確定，並由聯合國任命一邊界技術委負會進行劃界工作，該委會應向聯合國負責。（未完）</p>

<p>以上十二家吸收存款，辦理拆放，經營匯免，證據確實，經營地卜錢莊，已毫無疑問，核屬違反銀行法第十五條之規定，由金管局按同法同條處罰。其中友聯羅象記兩家，情節較重，已由該局通知布政府勒令停業，並各科其負責人罰金五千元，其餘同興當，寶庚豐糧食號，潤昌漢棉布號，甡茂號，胡煥記申莊，鴻大昌號六家，由該局通知市政府勒令停業，並各科其負責人罰金三千元。尚有鄭壽山，尹靜園，李鳳昌，袁紹德四人，並無字號，亦由該局通知市政府勒令該四人尅卽結束其經營地下錢莊業務，繳具切結，並各科以罰金三千元。此外有正泰號經查雖無經營地下錢莊之事實，惟代客買賣紗布，週轉頭寸，收付利息，亦屬超逾本業範圍，由該局通知市政府轉飭該號具結，嗣後不得有同樣情事發生。和祥信託公司與外埠地下錢莊勾結情事，另報財政部議處。寗松記經查來往款項均為本業範圍以內之週轉，尚無經營地下錢莊之跡象，應予免議。永業公司尚待詳查。</p>
<h3>金管局勸吿人民勿為厚利所引誘</h3>
<p>關於此次處分地下錢莊，據該局林局長稱，查地下錢莊之成立，由於經濟金融之不正常，人民賞圖高利，情願將血汗換來之金錢，存入或付託於不合法者之手，而演成混亂局面，今日經管工作已著成效，金融業務漸入正軌，不合法之組織必遭淘汰，希望人民所有款項切勿再為較高之利息引誘，冒險存入地下錢莊，以致本利毫無保障，務須與合法行莊往來，不但本身之資財得以安全，卽對於經管前途，亦有莫大之助力云。</p>
<h3>違反交易所法案四被吿審結候判　曾傳警已原承辦員作證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕股票商林樂耕及杜維屏·陶李國蘭·徐楊淑瑤等被控違反交易所法一案，地院昨日下午二時在第二庭，由沈天保庭長及梅爾和·方祥海兩推事開合議庭，再度審理，當經辯諭終結，定於本月二十八日上午十時宣判。</p>
<p>本案昨日開庭時，地院傳到證人鴻興證券號職員胡增達，華美工業貿易公司職員沈樹人曁警局原承辦人情報組長樓成翰，行動組長王思祖等四人到庭應訊。</p>
<p>除黑板等物無其他證據</p>
<p>據王思祖稱：奉命查獲本案各被吿經營塲外交易，關於杜維　部份，先後拋出二千九百萬股，均無成交單，亦無賬可稽，當為塲外交易；又華美為貿易公司，杜任總經理，警局·警備司令部及金管局派員，均查獲華美內設有黑板，擴音機，電話等證券號設備，窗口並掛有「警出」，「交割」等字樣，嗣該公司兩職員亦承認華美有塲外交易行為。林樂耕部份，因首先調查拋空，而後發現一九〇號經紀人字號之職負林樂耕，於八月十六·十七日先後買進一千六百萬股，全為塲外交易。陶李國蘭及徐楊淑瑤在局供認，與在逃之李伯勤，十九日在華美共拋出七百萬股，亦無賬册可稽。至於口供筆錄，其副本送達地院，正本仍存警局。末未應杜之辯護人詢問稱：在華美除查獲黑板等物外，並未查獲其他涉嫌證據。</p>
<p>胡增達證述不知拋股事</p>
<p>次由樓成翰陳述：警局奉總統府令，限期查獲「拋股案」，經與各方面調查結果，認為杜林等涉嫌，九月二傳訊時由各方人員會同審訊，由渠担任紀錄工作，初稿用速記記之，後重讀一遍，杜林等均無異議，後以初稿頗嫌凌亂，乃加以整理，於是日下午第二次傳訊時，將整理之口供重讀，社將其中「有塲外交易」詞句劃去。庭上次傳證人鴻興證劵號經理邱雲條未到，乃傳訊該號職員胡增建稱：現年二十七歲，在鴻與為學徒已三四月，每日在號聽報行情，寫黑板，對於買進賣出各項手續均不懂，十九日邱經理會令渠出外賣出一百萬股，當時因行情急遽下落，未果而返，對於拋出一千六百萬股事，答稱不知。</p>
<p>華美不做股票生意</p>
<p>嗣傳華美職員沈樹人稱：十八歲，在華美担任庶務工作，華美原經營電器及汽車等進出口業務，現已停歇，鴻興與華美均為杜經營，鴻興前以未有合適房所，擬移至華美開設分號，已將黑板等物遷至華美，嗣鴻興在證券大樓租得五〇一室，遷移之議乃；警局在華美查獲之黑板等物，卽係原擬作為籌設鴻興分號之用，華美並不做股票生意。十九日上午九時二十分，李伯勤帶兩女人到華美借打電話至鴻興拋股，後由鴻興工役將款帶至華美，遞交李伯勤，渠個人亦不做股票生意。庭上繼傳訊各被吿，林樂耕供：八月十六，十七日向鴻與邱經理買進一千六百萬股，因頭寸不齊，旋卽取消，以後未再買賣，更未拋空。</p>
<p>塲外交易·全不知情</p>
<p>陶李國蘭供：十九日上午拋出二百萬股，近午又補進，因係委託經紀人經手，不知是否為塲外交易。徐楊淑瑤供：我是現貨交易，不是拋空，我也不懂什麼呌數拋空，以前朱曾做過股票生意。李楊兩人餘供，與上次相同。最後由杜維屏供稱：渠在警局僅雲到補充口供筆錄，餘皆未過目，　　烽在警局之口供，不能由渠負賣，如有塲外交易，渠全不知情，素不認識其他各被吿，拋股各事，全不知道，邱雲峰屢傳不到庭，或係畏罪潛逃。供畢，庭上對各被吿復逐加詢問，卽由蒞庭檢察官丁同峻期述起訴意旨後，於三時半開始，由各被吿律師相繼辯論，至五時一刻辯論終結，定二十八宣判，各被吿請求交保朱准，諭令還押。</p>
<p>徐楊淑瑤啜泣不已</p>
<p>昨日開庭時，杜以腿部生瘡，日前於看守所內，請醫動用手術，行動不使，昨於待質室步至被吿攔時，由林樂耕扶行，庭上特准賜座，精神尚佳。徐楊淑瑤昨改著白底大紅花旗袍，與陶李國蘭均赤足，登同式圓口黑綉鞋。楊因懷孕，於應訊畢亦蒙庭上賜座休息，後聞伊之辯護律師汝保彝向庭上申述其「家破人亡」之現狀及身世時，不禁神傷，　泣不已。各被吿家屬出庭旁聽者百餘人，不如首次開審時之擁擠，退庭後，於傾盆大雨中相繼離去。</p>
<h3>詹沛霖案新發展又獲報紙五百令</h3>
<p>偵訊終結不日提起公訴</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紙業公會理事長詹沛霖，因囤積居奇案，刻羈押特種刑庭偵查中，昨日上午經檢察官提訊。綠該案最近有新發展，據警察局調查，除先前查出之囤積外，頃又查獲詹秘密堆存之白報紙五百令，由於囤積物資已化整為零，可能尚有其他地方秘密堆存，警局將查獲情形函請特庭偵訊。昨據詹供稱：「五百令白報紙確係我所有，惟均係次等貨色。」嗣經檢察官訊究尙有其他傾積否？詹則堅稱均已查獲。訊　倉仍還押。聞該案偵查部份業已終結，日內卽將提起公訴。</p>
<h3>蔣經國召見萬墨林李銘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米因來源不暢，昨日已漲抵限價，市上交易稀少，蔣督導員對此異常關切，昨日午後五時特命經檢大隊長程義寬乃情報組長樓承翰邀本市米業公會理事長萬墨林至督導員辦公處談話萬於六時抵達央行，在休息室坐待召見，至六時五十分由程義寬陪同謁見蔣經國，五分鐘後卽忽忽辭出，一般推測經管當局已責成其平抑米價，如漲勢不戢或供應不繼，將唯萬氏是問。又本市銀行公會理事長李銘，昨日亦被邀報吿行莊外匯資產移　情形。</p>
<h3>黃牛有洞便鑽　紛紛虛設字號　套取派烟牟利社局嚴予審核</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市紙烟缺貨，自各烟公司開始依限價派貨後，乃引起董牛黨之注意，紛紛虛設字號，甚至擺一小攤，向社會局申請登記，套取派烟牟利。連日社會局工商登記處門庭若市，大批黃牛混雜其間，向社會局辦理登記手續。社會局洞悉其弊，為防止黃牛黨投機取巧起見，對工商字號申請登記者已嚴密審核。新創立之烟號，除必須有充足之資本外，並須有捲烟公會會員兩家之保證，蓋章證明其確係正當商業，始得由請登記。業已開設之烟號則必須特有財政局營業牌照及三十七年四月至六月份之營業稅收據，經社會局證明後，始得由請派貨。</p>
<h3>西藥缺乏原因又是黃牛作崇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來市上西藥缺乏，門市購買困難，甚至影響醫院之診治工作。記者昨日曾晤經檢大隊長程義寬氏，當卽探詢西藥缺乏是否由於藥房囤積所致。據程氏表示：西藥買不着，主因恐為缺貨，而非藥房之囤積，尤其規模大之藥房，如有囤積行為，頗易查出。最近發現本市某大華房有大批貨物寄存倉庫，但經批出後，方知皆屬補品而非特效藥。本人認為本市之大批西藥，恐均在黃牛黨手中，黑市售出，可較限價高出一倍左右，厚利所在，故趨之若驚。</p>

<h3>敵偽房屋地產處理辦法改訂　仍准許住戶優先承購</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕滬區經濟督導員俞鴻鈞等奉總統令飭加緊處理敵偽房地產事，頃特擬就改訂敵億偽房屋地產處理辦法，電呈政院，略稱：該項房地產，現均有人居住，政院前頒辦法，原准住戶優先承購，嗣以幣值貶落甚速，估價收款時間較長，政府因頗多損失，卽改為一律標　。但以房荒嚴重，不便進行，現幣制改革後幣值穩定，擬改訂辦法如次：（一）一律按市值估價，另加一成後；通知住戶限十日內承購，先交保證金半數，餘自通知日起，一個月內繳淸，逾期不繳，卽沒收其保證金，如十日內不承購，作放棄諭，卽行公開招標，仍准住戶參加　標。（二）一　標售，住戶須於一個月內遷讓，以便交付得標人，違者由經濟督導員辦公處强制執行，該項辦法俟政院通過後卽付施行。</p>

<h3>大上海靑年服務總隊　幹部訓練昨開始　蔣經國致詞勗勉一番</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大上海靑年服務總幹部訓練已於昨日開始，幹部隊員共五百人，晨間在江灣舉行開訓禮時，蔣經國氏出席致詞，勉該隊靑年應以正義的火把，來照耀黑暗的世界。並謂今日政府之經濟政策，不以檢查倉庫，平抑物價為滿足。此僅為達成目的之手段，而非目的本身。吾人之目的，是在創浩靑年人所理想之三民主義的新社會。在這裏沒有剝削，沒有壓迫，沒有欺詐，沒有一切不合理的現象，大家都渦着自由快樂的生活。旋謂我人今日從事此項工作，必可獲得廣大人民的擁護，因我人卽一無所有，復一無所求，我人除健全之身體與智慧決心而外，沒有一分產業，沒有一片地皮，故我們應亳無顧忌的幹。同時我們努力奮鬥，祇為國家與人民的幸福，而不是為了升官發財，所以我們又無所恐懼。至此，氏以誠懇之態度，勉靑年以謙廠·冷靜，並斥驕傲自大，頹唐腐化。又謂決心為力量的泉源，我們作事應如眾隊之打仗，一城一地的得失，不足以決定全盤戰局，而當以堅守到最後一個堡壘的決心，來貫澈其使命。末以最感動之語調稱：「我今天可與諸君宣誓，如果我有一絲一毫的貪污，大家都可以拿手槍打死我。</p>
<p>分組討論</p>
<p>蔣氏致詞畢，繼卽分組討論，題為「新上海的展望」。結論有三項：（一）舊上海之罪惡：甲，奸商操縱下之經濟，使大多數人失去幸福。乙，官僚控制下之政治，使大多數人失去權利。丙，地痞流氓把持下之社會，使大多數人失去自由。（二）新上海之輪廓：甲，新上海是老百姓的。乙，新上海之政治應是人人守法，處處安定，人人自由。丙，新上海之經濟，應是人人有衣穿，有飯吃，有屋住，有事作，資本投於生產，生產配合消費，消費適應國富。丁，新上海之社會應是多數壓制少數，善良緊倒强暴，百姓壓倒官僚。（三）上海翻身與中國大改造，需要全上海及全中國革命靑年團結起來，與人民站在一起，以熱血與生命為廣大的窮苦人民爭取幸福與自由。大上海靑年服務總隊之組織，卽為此種革命性的社會運動云。</p>

<h3>房地產交易愈活潑　一二畝空地需求最旺盛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市房地產交易，週來愈見活潑。據業中人談：此中交易，以空地之成交額佔多，次為空屋之買賣。至佔住之房地產，交易依然呆滯，價亦疲落。據調查：近來地政局過戶案件，較前有顯著之增加，最多即為一畝二畝之空地交易，次即為價值十萬元左右之空屋。而佔住之房地產，竟乏交易。例如：北京路·廣東路·中山東路一帶較佳地段之空地，每畝市價刻在十四萬至十六萬元之間，供售者少，物色者衆。而同地段佔住之房地產，空地每畝價雖抑低至四萬元，賣戶求售頗殷，惟仍乏受戶。據吿：近日較大之地產交易正在進行中者，有哈同花園沿福煦路一帶之空地，惟開價奇昂。聞沿福煦路一帶之空地，每畝索價十六萬元，再向裏之空地，每畝索價九萬至十萬元。據稱實際之佔價，前者每畝約值十二萬元，後者每畝約值七萬元。</p>

<h3>日月潭訪公主　台灣高山族風光</h3>
<p>— 徐茂春</p>
<p>台灣高山族的抗日運動，曾寫下光榮的悲壯的史詩，如七脚川，巴望街事件，均予日人以頭痛的打擊。尤其民國十九年的霧社事件，因不堪日人之凌辱，殺死日警及日人一百三十四人，當時日人用大砲，飛機，肆行暴虐，仍未能攻進　社，最後施用毒氣，社衆見勢不能敵，大部份自盡於岩窟，日人始奏勝，但因此却轟動了全世界，國際主持人道正義的國家亦粉粉起而責難。</p>
<p>日人統治期間，對山胞的行動極端限制，幷呌他們為「生蕃」「熟蕃」或「土蕃」，對山胞十分歧視，這是一種錯誤，自台省光復後，依據三民主義為施政方針——國內各民族一律平等，故現在已將蕃之名改為高山族，以矯正人們的視聽。</p>
<p>筆者來台已經三月，返欲明瞭高山同胞情形，且為好奇心所驟使，忙裏偸閒，獨個兒由高雄到日月潭，去訪問這為國人所關懷的高山族同胞。</p>
<p>日月潭位於玉山之北台中城東廿十九公里，海拔七百二十六公尺，形成別有天地，湖上一片碧綠，漫漫漪漣，恍如一面大鏡，山影倒映湖心，宛似一幅圖畫，尤其那朝嵐夕暉，氣象萬千，瞬息倐忽，變幻無窮，謂為合灣絕勝，誠無愧色。這秀麗而引人入勝的風光，讓千萬旅人們沈醉遨遊於其懷抱，流連而忘返——這高山同胞的故鄕，是多麼的幽雅而令人羨煞啊！</p>
<p>山胞住處，地名呌「卜吉」，在日月潭東濱，筆者由涵碧樓渡過了湖，上岸後，在卜吉村邊的桄椰樹下發現了一塊滿註着注音字母的字牌，寫着：</p>
<p>山地的祚嚄族，二百七十年前他們祖先因在巒大山，八通關附近追逐白鹿，發現了日月潭，才由阿里山朱馬社遷至石人社，（按石人社在日月潭邊在卜吉之西約三里），到了電力工程竣工，石人社沒於水，（按日月潭為台省最大電力貯水池），才搬至卜吉（土名馬老寳），因此地交通便利，故開化較早，日人佔領期間，因被視為「化蕃」，故呌「蕃化社」，過去制度，酋長為一部落之領袖，本村領袖已易十次，現任毛信孝隣長卽為前該部落酋長。本村現屬台中縣玉山區魚池鄉？全村計四十一戶，人口：男九十二名，女八十七名，共一百七十九名，就學兒童五十五名，有毛，石，陳，謝，袁，黃，高，劉，張，畢，邱，朱等十二姓。該社務農漁樵，可以自給自足，每年陰曆八月初一至十五半個月內，有着盛大的舞會，本村自光復後，設有國語講習班，分成人和兒童兩班，積極推行國語……</p>
<p>筆者看過了這字牌，對卜吉山胞已得到了一個輪廓，想這時正是他們開盛大舞會期間，正沾沾自喜，忽然傳來悅耳歌聲，發現數十山胞正在婆娑的歌舞着，連忙上前參觀，祗見他們手挽着手的以大石為圓心，圍着大圈，載歌載舞，逐步向右移動，節拍井然，歌聲與潭水相呼應，餘音嫋嫋，動人心弦，頗足欣賞。</p>
<p>此舞纔止，彼歌又起，另有婦女數人，各持搗米本椿一枝，圍合於穴徑約一公尺的堅石四周，同時舉椿，同時歌唱，邊唱邊搗，板眼整齊，據說此卽有名的杵歌，又名石音，以杵擊石發出的聲音，以協調歌聲，亦淸婉悅耳</p>
<p>山胞的歌謠很多，據他們那天唱得次數較多而較輕鬆，經筆者與駐該村的台灣省國語推行委員會幹事日月潭國語講習班主持人葉于岡先生（福建壽寗人）記錄並已譯成國語者，有「不怕浪來不怕風」一曲，茲特附錄如下，以饗讀者：</p>
<p>（不怕浪來不怕風）</p>
<p>不怕浪來不怕風</p>
<p>我們搖着漁舟得向湖中進</p>
<p>哥把網兒張</p>
<p>妹把槳兒搖</p>
<p>為了生活那管漁艇西東</p>
<p>一家魚舟西東</p>
<p>沒有月來沒有星</p>
<p>我們點着魚燈得向湖中進</p>
<p>爸把網兒張</p>
<p>媽把獎兒搖</p>
<p>為了生活那管無月無星</p>
<p>一家魚舟西東</p>
<p>烟霧裏，雨紛紛</p>
<p>搖着魚舟進湖中</p>
<p>隨波逐流去</p>
<p>不怕風雨緊</p>
<p>不怕浪兒高</p>
<p>為了生活那管激雨狂風</p>
<p>一家魚舟西東</p>
<p>筆者訪問毛信孝酋長，却巧毛酋長不在家，由大公主和二公主接見，她們打扮得很整齊，穿的是中等布質的蕃服，頭上戴着彩色的玻璃帶，幷插上羽翎，姿態五官都很端正，尤其那二公主，二九年華，亭亭玉立，已經是夠動人的了，再加上她那燙得很摩登而美觀的雲髪，施得很均勻的胭脂和唇膏，容光煥發，更是嬌艷欲滴，不過　為美中不足的，便長上半段雖很講究，但她那雙尊脚，却習慣地赤着足，沒穿鞋子。</p>
<p>「你爸爸到那裏去了？」我開始用很緩和的語調問她們。</p>
<p>「爸爸上山去了。」她們倆異口同聲的用很流利的國語答覆，使我驚訝地瞪了一瞪眼。</p>
<p>「你們呌做什麽名字？」</p>
<p>「毛玉娟」，大公主先說，「毛阿秀」，二公主也跟着說。</p>
<p>「你家里有甚麼人？」</p>
<p>「爸爸，媽媽，姊姊，和我。」二公主搶先說。</p>
<p>「沒有兄弟嗎？」我繼續問。</p>
<p>「沒有。」二公主的語尾拖得特別嬌長。</p>
<p>「你們的先生呌什麼名字？」我以探取材料的目的，很不客氣的追問她們。</p>
<p>「呌毛阿壽。」大公主含羞的說，「妹妹還沒有許人。」</p>
<p>「為什麼你的丈夫也姓毛？」我覺得很奇怪。</p>
<p>「招駙馬」。大公主遲疑了一會，畢究二公主來得靈敏。「外來的呌我姊姊做什麼伊麗莎白，呌姊夫做什麽愛丁保或什麼蒙巴頓，他們還呌我做什麽瑪格萊呢！」她斷斷續續的說出來，但我更驚奇她的見聞。</p>
<p>「駙馬做什麽？不是當海軍吧？」我打趣的說。</p>
<p>「他最近到上海買布去了。」大公主信口便答。　「他去上海你不感到寂寞嗎？」我笑着問大公主。大公主好像還沒有聽懂我這話，祗是吁了口氣，懶洋洋的站起來，我發現她的肚皮已是大腹便便了。我暗想她的分娩期大概也同伊麗莎白的分娩期差不多時候。</p>
<p>「你將嫁什麼人？」我半正經半打趣的問二公主。</p>
<p>「嫁你先生！」大公主嘻皮笑臉的指着我大聲的說。「中國人」，二公主也自然的同時說，引起哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>最後徵得她們的同意，簽名幷拍照紀念，筆者一連和她們合拍三次，還請她們敎我跳舞，我共給她們台幣一千元（按：外人與她們拍照，照例每人每次台幣二百元，日月潭遊客甚衆，據統計此項收入頗可觀），我在她們連聲「謝謝！」「再會！一聲中吿辭。</p>
<p>筆者再巡視村中各處，時正午飯時分，飲酒猜拳之聲四起，她們拿大碗盛酒，兩人同碗豪飮，狀甚慷慨愉快，據說他們極嗜烟酒，無論男女老幼，幾乎每飯不忘。</p>
<p>再行數十步，又發現一個奇蹟：一個年約二十二三歲的少年，背着一把椅子，椅子上坐着一位濃裝艷服的少女，後面跟着一大羣人，鑼鼓喧天，炮竹連珠的響着。「這做什麼？」筆者莫明其妙的自言自語的問着，「這是迎親！」一位站在我跟前的少年用着很生硬的國語吿訴我說：「坐在椅子上的是新娘，背椅子的是新郞，他們從在山頭唱歌結識立下了誓願，黃道吉日，新郞背着椅子到新娘家裏去親自把新娘接回來，不過，這個法子，已不多用，新的迎親方法，是用轎子扛的。」我聽了才恍然大悟。這樣的迎親方法，體力稍差的男子，豈不是沒資格結婚？</p>
<p>臺已重歸祖國懷抱，高山同胞是我們中華民族的一支，他們已有長足的進步，他們已跟上了時代，我們絕不能以蕃民歧視他們，我們應精誠合作，團結一致，讓我們緊握着摯誠的手，齊着步調，向復興民族坦途邁進！筆者訪問高山族。觀感至深，甚盼國人對高山族有這新的認識。</p>
<p>孫院長科與高山族酋長毛信孝合影</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州廿九日航訊〕蘭市自來水工程因水管奇缺，曾注意黃河鐵橋畔之廢物鐵牛，擬用以改鑄水管，前經市參會通過同意後，即將挖掘。按此項鐵牛在黃河南北岸各二，乃鐵橋未築成前牽挂浮橋之物，每牛重約四千餘斤，抗戰時警局曾擬拍賣此物，修築六分局局址，卒因無法挖出，致屹立至今，因埋土中之一段，較外露者長五分之三，故欲挖掘此項笨重之鐵牛，必需起重機五隻以上。</p>

<h3>隴上秋色　「雲遮中秋月穀倉脹破裂」　農夫們憧憬着豐收</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州十八日航訊〕昨天中秋節，淸早市民們爭着買肉過節，一霎眼肉架上已空，遭自然是屠戶們在向市府「冷戰」。有些地方甚至搶購起肉來，一個無法證實的消息：某肉市搶肉羣中，一個公務員的食指，被屠夫當成豬蹄，一刀兩段，此事雖近無稽之談，但也足說明市面是什麽樣子。</p>
<p>今年的市面上，食品店一紥紥的節禮確已歛跡，禮劵奉命停售，「節約」似已普遍，惟有小月餅遵照限價，矯驅忽然消瘦，倒也巧小玲瓏。</p>
<p>很多店舖，上午便休息，到下午已是家家打烊，頗有過廢曆年的景象。晚上浮雲掩月，急煞一般文人騷客，只是農夫們擠瞇了笑眼，念着「雲遮中秋月，穀倉脹破裂」的諺語，憧憬着來年的豐收。</p>
<p>一年容易又秋風！聽說地方當局對棉，毛，皮等貨品，也議妥了限價，只待公佈，喧嚷了一週的「物價手册」，遲遲不見出版，市府經濟檢查隊日前抽查倉庫和逮捕「金老虎」，結果查出了德順興等幾家金樓，有違法經營收兌金銀及私營放款的嫌疑，福聚公等幾家行棧，有囤積貨品及經營硬幣嫌疑，均於今天解送蘭州特刑庭法辦。查出的貨物限定在本市照限價出售，不得出境。同時，加强管制物資辦法也已公佈，今後入境貨物要登記，非經核准不許貨物出境。這樣，轉入地下的物資，是不是會自動出來，人民還希望政府作一兩次普查</p>
<p>全國限價聲中，交通部第七區公路工程局的養路費，像已得到默契似的，突於中秋佳節宣吿增加，而且來勢兇猛，一漲便是百分之一百八千，新的費率是：陜，寗，靑三省養路費每噸公里為四分零五毫，甘省境內為四分五厘，據說過去路局每月要賠累兩千億元法幣，不漲實在維持不住了！</p>
<p>張治中　出巡河西</p>
<p>張治中將軍到西北來已兩年多了，但都是以迪化·蘭州為據點，飛來飛去，西北的咽喉河西，還沒有走過一次，所以在本月五日，帶了卅多人出發河西巡視，約廿五·六可以回來。張氏此次除視察河西走廊的軍政設施外，另一個任務，便是要促成黨團人士間的大國結。</p>
<p>加强經濟管制後，蘭州原有的九個信用合作社，有六個被强迫停業，三個則准予復業，迄今兩月餘，仍無復業者，其原因是政府限定各信合社業務對象，應以社員為限，各社考慮到復業後將無法維持，加以改幣後市塲沉悶，金融停滯，各社咸具戒心，看來政府如不修改限制法令，連這奉准復業而迄未復業的三家信合社，也要解散了。</p>
<p>改幣後國家行局停止一切放款，本市各公私營企業均感資金週轉不靈，公營企業因為出品價格凍結，而員工薪津支出却陡增兩倍，已開始採取緊縮政策，結果當然是栽員。犬家眼巴巴等着的開放貸款，據央行楊霽靑經理說，四聯總處理事會正在研究中。（本報記者宋麟）</p>

<p>麺粉　供應稀少，成交淸淡，市勢繼續堅挺。老車·兵船·紅　·建成·等，因無供應，故不開出，僅有貨品較低之金龍粉及麥根粉等，按限價開出。英雄粉較次，開六元八角五分，又阜豐福新等七大廠商聯台配售各零售商各牌粉，計登記零售商有三百餘家，合配七千餘包，每家得二十五包左右。麩皮以限價做開。</p>
<p>雜糧　堅挺，交易不多，黃豆洋莊胃口已减，油）廠有納取，車豆·乍豆。各按限價，新黃豆本街銷暢，市甚俏利。苞米北帮納取較多，上漲一二角。紅糧鄉莊化活，亦挺一二角，蠶豆·元麥·菉豆·均平平，芝蔴仍做上日原價，生仁提高貨稍有成交。</p>
<p>食油　繼續上漲，因各糧均漲，人心仍堅。豆油上落甚鉅，初開為五十元零五角，一度曾抵五十一元五角，收市因出戶不絕，回低至五十元零三角，軋漲八角。生菜油收市四十七元，計漲五大角。凈生油五十九元九角，離限價一角，熱菜油升五角，小車蔴油特抑低一角。豆餅仍以四元大角成交。</p>

<h3>洋莊茶交易稀</h3>
<p>擯持多日之洋莊茶市，昨輸出商雖猶熱烈問津，但執主感於產區貨稀價挺，續萌不忍輕易割愛之意，致過程依然岑靜，交易咸僅零星，趨勢則堪稱穩固。</p>
<p>茲悉：　來北菲對於　茶甚為關懷，並仍致電此間茶商，垂詢價格，但目前我國茶葉自產製成本步砌後，將高於國外茶價，照此情形，漸難配合出口，前途恐未許樂觀。至於內銷茶，供求尚有，迄鮮榮辱。</p>
<h3>食糖一蹶不振</h3>
<p>食糖自禁遝出境以來，外銷均　停頓，本街去化又有限，市况由此一蹶不振。昨日成交稀少，走勢尤平。二〇期台赤棧單，晨開二四·五七元，午收二四·七〇元，（現貨未見登市）袋裝與革包四半，各以二九元及二八元九角收市，較上日見疲一二角。粗砂微秀一角，為二七·二〇元，海赤本廠綿白上升二角，其他各檔仍站上日原離。</p>

<h3>絲綢價穩交稀</h3>
<p>生絲價穩交稀，執散均抱觀望，市勢趨於沉寂狀態。人絲義貨配售充沛，各方均飽和，絲織公會八十二期中信局配貨已領到，昨日開始配售各綢廠。八十三期已呈核中，市塲日貨稀少，了無交易。</p>
<p>又訊：國市秋銷已動，門市生瀝更盛，批發行莊略有售出，為數不多。絲織公會配售五十萬囑中，上海佔半數，一俟　綢緞公會洽商後，卽行普遍配售。但市塲現貨，需要仍股，惟存底稀薄，交易更少。</p>

<h3>棉紗市況平庸　布疋源不匱走勢盤挫</h3>
<p>棉紗昨市申新永安開紗，市況先堅後軟，人心甚平，市氣亦軟。昨日本街客帮納胃不健，細紗略軟，廿支粗紗，供求相等，價無上落。十六支以下申新開配多種，人心轉疲，價見軟弱。</p>
<p>昨布市走勢盤挫，行莊增資聲中，執戶稍有脫手，市勢初甚堅定。龍頭細布及四君子元嗶嘰，俱以二八圖五角開盤，門莊零售布號添配機染公會配售棉布後，納胃飽足，客帮以大量出口尚懸為禁例，多抱觀望態度，中途供源不匱，高價難支，臨收交易稀落，多吿盤跌。</p>

<h3>輸管會設法調劑水泥廠包裝材料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會消息：自勝利以還，我國水泥生產卽已大量增加。國外如香港新嘉坡南韓等處，前來訂貨者甚多。但因缺乏包裝水泥所需材料，以致影響出口數量，實菲淺鮮。為遵照行政院翁院長推行水泥其他生產品出口，保持吾國水泥工業生產之政策，並援助水泥廠家獲得包裝水泥之紙袋起見，輸管會曾數度與各有關方面會商後，決定下列數項辦法，呈奉行政院核准實行：</p>
<p>（一）華新啓新中國上海江南華北及順昌等水泥廠，請求在國外購入首批紙袋約一百五十萬隻，價值美金十六萬五千元，以應急需一節，輸管會呈准行政院暫時將第四季分配於上述廠家之蔴袋配額，轉撥美金十六萬五千元，以便支付上項歡目之紙袋。其進口外匯，卽按照現行之貿易辦法辦理結匯。</p>
<p>（二）各廠家必須努力輸出水泥，一俟與外商訂定售貨合約後，郎可由銀行開具信用狀，以便輸入紙袋，每批紙袋之輸入，必須比照輸出水泥之價值。輸入紙袋之最高總值，以不超過美金一百萬元為限。</p>
<p>（三）在各水泥廠家業已輸出價值一百萬美元後，得按照包裝材料輸入辦法，申請輸入紙袋及其所需之器材。</p>
<p>上項辦法之商討，現任中加有限公司董事長及創辦人洛埃比亞斯先生，及該公司美華代表烏姆斯代先生，頗多協助。彼等對於此項紙袋之輸入，在各廠家未曾輸出水泥之前，卽願予以墊款，藉以表示其對中國之信念及協助之誠意云。</p>

<h3>從雕塑藝術看民族文化</h3>
<p>— 劉華瑞</p>
<p>考古學在中國提倡發展以來，仰韶期（Late　Neolithic　Petiod　of　Yang　Shao）器具，示吾人以古代文化追尋綫索，而河南股墟出土之陶器甲骨，尤有助於證明中國文明是否與中央亞細亞有互相聯緊諸學說（如法拉古伯理氏「中國文化西源論」及英鮑爾「蘇末文」與一中國文」等著作）之價值。銅器逐漸出土，又證明了楚文化（湖北湖南區械之紀元第八世紀時代）之發達。甚至關於神農，黃帝，大禹的紀載，都可能證明不是神話。爾雅與山海經中草木鳥獸，也供獻了動植物學史上不少材料（參考亞洲文會My．Sowerby著作）。</p>
<p>上海市立美術館籌備處近舉行中國雕塑展覽會，陳列出品中有關於古代文獻者不少，足資研究參考。所有陶器，銅器，石刻，木刻等尤足使吾認識中國古代文明，不但不腐敗，不落後，而且壯麗偉大，卽雕塑一項亦可與希臘文化相頡頏。倒是現代中國藝術反而空虛萎　，沒有樹立起來。</p>
<p>計經和周禮上所記載的那些「　」「冕」「垂」等日用服飾，乃至樂器建築，都非常美觀而具獨立性，可以在陳列品中得到更進一步的認識。如丁惠康藏唐三彩「盤」之色調鮮强，具有唐代隆盛之反映。陳倚石藏重慶沙磁區出土石刻「飛仙」「飛虎」等拓片數事，可考見宋代藝術確不亞現代歐美圖案。尤以楚「鏡」，周「敦」等古銅彝謂，（蔣玄怡葉叔重等藏）甚有助於原始史乘之參考。誠中國敦原民族，所產生之敦厚文明的象徵，其價值光耀照澈數千年，迄木少衰，眞奇績矣！此外瑞齋主人與鄭振鐸所廠魏陶器等件，劉海粟所藏石刻木刻，均足激發吾人對中國文化之省悟。</p>
<p>我學術界人士果能根據各時代出土寶物，作比較研究，發展吾民族新藝術料學，一變二十年來專在書本上玄想，咬文嚼字的迷古或疑古，把中國民族文化說得玄之又玄，或是一文不值，都足以將民族文化學術價值摧毀無遺，而今後立國之民族新意識亦無由建立。這是今後我國學術界所應深思猛省的。</p>

<h3>坐三輪車記</h3>
<p>— 夢秋</p>
<p>前天晚上，應朋友之約，到虹口一家日本菜館吃東洋火鍋，吃得滿身大汗，我友的興緻仍舊極好，一定還要請我看光陸大戲院的電影。光陸在博物院路底，博物院路卽今之所謂虎丘路者，想必大家都知道。</p>
<p>電影看完，將近十一點，正飄着濛濛小雨，我欣然謝過了我的朋友，就想呌三輪車回家。</p>
<p>三輪車夫問：「啥地方？」</p>
<p>「白克路梅白格路口。」我說。</p>
<p>白克路梅白格路，我自己聽了也抝口，像說急口令似的。為什麼這兩個佶屈聱牙的譯名偏是那麼相像，而且又離開得這樣近呢？新路名是有的，梅白格路就呌「新昌路」，不過呌三輪畢時如果說新昌路，十個車夫中至少倒有七八個不曉得，久而久之，我連白克路新名是什麼都忘了。</p>
<p>三輪車夫一笑，露出一只金牙，他說：　七角洋錢。」</p>
<p>七角？不是法幣二百十萬嗎？虧他說得出！我不禁大怒，也不理睬他，再呌：</p>
<p>「三輪車！」</p>
<p>「啥地方？」又來了一輛。</p>
<p>「白克路梅白格路。」</p>
<p>「五角。落雨天，先生。」</p>
<p>「五十萬！」</p>
<p>「先生，五十萬祗有幾個大餅呢？好了，四角錢！」</p>
<p>「五十萬！」</p>
<p>「好，軋實三角錢，不能再少了。」</p>
<p>我不理，朝南就走，他跟在後面。我看見北京路口有空車，剛想呌時，他又說話了：</p>
<p>「先生，兩角半錢總好了罷？東西貴呀！」</p>
<p>「好，六十萬，多一個銅板不要。」</p>
<p>他嘆了一口氣，說：</p>
<p>「來來來，七十萬七十萬。你先生不在乎十萬塊。」</p>
<p>我一看，雨珠漸大。北京路口的空車已經我到了主顧，如果堅持下去，在雨中跑到大馬路四川路都未必一定呌得着。只得心裏呌一聲「可惡！」傴僂着身體鑽上了車。剛坐定，就覺得自已調長衫的上半段已經着實濕了一大塊。車子慢慢前進的時候，不禁又暗暗駡了一聲「可惡」。</p>
<p>車子裏面當然悶熱異常，雨却愈下愈大，打在車篷上，像有人把一盤豆撒在地板上的聲音。</p>
<p>走了半天望見國際飯店了，忽然他轉了灣。我想，大概是要走近路罷？國際飯店邊上的派克路確是好像比梅白格路短一點。</p>
<p>然而，他忽然不動了。車夫跳下了車子，就來解開車上的油布。</p>
<p>我覺得不對，就說：「我是到白克路梅白格路的，還沒有到呀！」</p>
<p>他忽然面色變得難看起來，狠狠的說：「講好到派克路白克路的，到了！」</p>
<p>大雨正傾盆而下。</p>
<p>我沒有辦法，祇好讓步：「好了好了，加你十萬塊，到白克路梅白格路西首一點點，中美醫院不到。」</p>
<p>他不響了，重新跨上了車座，慢慢踏去。</p>
<p>我從袋內拿出皮夾來，從油布邊上透進來的路燈光裏一搖一先地點着鈔票。糟糕，除掉四十幾萬關金票以外，全是嶄新的金圓劵，祗得叫他找了——少不得又要在大雨中多立幾分鐘。脚上的黃皮鞋還是前天剛買的呢！</p>
<p>到了，我下了車，交給他一張金圓一元的鈔票。</p>
<p>他說：「一塊錢，還要找錢呢——」接着又輕輕的嘰咕着：「眞麻煩！」一面在褲帶上的反夾子裏數起鈔票來。</p>
<p>雨還是下着，我的頭頂裘冷冰冰地着了幾滴，但覺他順流而下，有一種說不出的難受。</p>
<p>他拿出了十幾張鈔票，我一點，只有二百萬。我說：「只有兩百萬，還少廿萬呢？」</p>
<p>他倒光起火來，說：「沒有小票了！」</p>
<p>我實在忍無可忍，就想到隔壁烟紙店碰門，兌了小票再給他。二十萬塊錢本來沒有什麼，可是，實在太有些氣人了……</p>
<p>但是，雨勢愈來愈猛，而且打雷了。</p>
<p>而且，自己已經到了門口。身上又濕得要命，綢長衫裏在身上簡直像是湯裏撈起來的「豆腐衣」。</p>
<p>哦一聲不響，回身把鑰匙拿出來開門。</p>
<p>他看見我不說話，一面踏動車子，一面倒笑了起來：「哈哈，二十萬塊錢本來能派什麼用塲！好了好了，派頭大來西！」</p>
<p>我氣極，回頭看時，他已經去得遠了。</p>
<h3>帝王市塲</h3>
<p>— 張淸</p>
<p>全世界最奇怪的交易所，恐怕就是瑞士沮利希地方的帝王市塲了。</p>
<p>譬如說，你確信西班牙一定會復辟，你就可以像買普通股票一樣大舉買進西班牙廠王儲唐璜的股票。反之，如果你看準了瑞典的王室一定要遜位而宣布共和，那麼你也就可以「拋出」瑞典王的股票。</p>
<p>這種股票自然上落極大，例如唐璜在前一陣突然把他的籌備復辟的機關搬到西班牙邊境的時候，唐璜的股票立刻飛漲。又如羅馬尼亞的米海王因為不愛江山愛美人，棄位出奔海外的時候，他的股票就一落千丈。</p>
<p>這些股票商人的份子當然相當複雜，他們的買空賣空，都有很自私的動機，主要倒是想在復辟之後掌握某些特權。至於貴族們之熱心奔走，盡力籌募復辟費用，則是希望能够回到當年安富尊榮的好日子。</p>
<p>現在這市塲上最「熟門」的股票就是唐璜。他在葡萄牙海濱的一個小城愛司托里爾有一個別墅，別墅裏貴客絡繹不絕，和西班牙京城瑪德里更有極密切的聯絡。他的從人們興致極高，因為美國支持唐璜已是人所共知的事實，據說國務院極希望他能取弗期哥而代之。據「民族」雜誌的報導，國務院還曾為了這件事請求敎皇諒解呢。</p>
<p>而且，唐璜目前是歷史上有名的波滂族（Bourbon）的領袖。波滂一家產生的帝王著實不少，自公元八八八年歐地斯登基為法國皇帝後，這一家裏出了三十七個法國皇帝，十七個西班牙王，二十九個葡萄牙王，二十一個那波里斯王，十三個匈牙利王，四個神聖羅馬帝國皇帝。這些國家中，今天沒有一個是有帝王的，但唐璜的左右却深信復辟之期已經不遠了。</p>
<p>帝王市塲上的「熱門」中，還有一個義大利廢王恩柏多。義大利人民舉行公民投票，贊成共和政體之後，他被迫去國，但並未正式做過遜位的手續。而且他也深知在目前義大利杌隉不安的政局之中，希望他回去的保皇黨大有人在。</p>
<p>此外，羅馬尼亞的廢王米海和他的父親加羅爾（都是因不愛江山愛美人而遜位的），也頗受人注意，比利時廢王李亞波爾特却就沒有什麼人顧問了。阿爾巴尼亞的廢王左格（Zog）也常常喜歡談起他國內保皇黨地下工作的情形，但帝王市塲的顧客們對他竟毫無興趣。</p>
<p>最奇怪的是居然還有一位「巴黎伯爵」，說是想回到法國去做皇帝。他和唐璜一樣，也住在愛斯托里爾。在帝皇夢尚朱實現之前，此公倒頗安分守己，從事於科學化農塲，收入不惡，天天穿了工裝勤奮工作，不大肯談政治，一有閒空便逗孩子——他的子女有十人之多。</p>
<p>法國政府是不准他回國的，但是他在一九三八年居然溜回去過一次，在巴黎近郊舉行了一次記者招待會，慷慨激昂地說：「法國恢復帝制，時機業已成熟。」可惜他的號召竟然無人理會，祗得悄然回到葡萄牙種田了。</p>
<p>不過，帝王市塲中却有人在注意他，偶然也有人要買他的股票。</p>
<h3>藝樓雜詩</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>八月十四夜作</p>
<p>憑欄俯仰夜何其，草樹向黃河漢移，露重靑天如涕瑛，月明鳥鵠亦流離，一年空有家　夢，半世兼憐　盡疲，舊客剡溪東望苦，祗今城郭渺紅旗。</p>
<p>骨銷心腐坐咨嗟，隱隱千靈耳語譁，地下阿娘同望月，亂餘遊子不歸家；三更作伴虫相答，萬里無雲眼轉花，白髮桐棺烽火裏，可堪一餅祭天涯！</p>
<p>以秋喻吾生，頗惜逝者半，高梧吐哀凉，策策若揮翰，下和萬虫聲，惟曰酒可玩。姚侯秣陵來，衰　挾健腕，樓坐狀茲奇，茶烟凝復散，杯外淸何時，歲暮捫腹歏！江湖本紛歧，誰其生事換？微言有甚矜，墨色空璀璨，苦與造化爭，拙於黃金鍛。金天殺氣嚴，野老意轉澹，薄罰科詩罪，西湖自貶竄，堤名歸白蘇，橋柳尚姓段，鵑啼幸非時，倘畢天下亂，揚袂覆棋枰，蒼然泯楚漢。</p>
<p>中秋疾又作不果赴杭詰朝柬謝湖上　子</p>
<p>酒波夜泛白衣船，定說風流勝往年，湖面淸寬天意吝，秋蠶忽忽入三眠。（自夏徂秋三度抱病矣）</p>
<p>浮雲無定月如驚，特為捲　到四更，我自樓頭我白髪，人間苦望是河淸！</p>
<h3>公式</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>一天，有一個人去拜訪大科學家愛因斯坦，他嘮叨了半天，一定要愛因斯坦吿訴他成功的秘訣。愛因斯坦很客氣的說：「假定我們以A來代表一個人的成功，那麼得到成功的公式應當是：A等於X加Y加Z。X就是工作，Y是游戲。」</p>
<p>那個客人就問：「Z是什麼呢？」</p>
<p>愛因斯坦微徵一笑，說：「Z就是少開口。」</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 晋霖</p>
<p>世界上銷售最多的一本書當推聖經，平均每年銷去三千萬本，每天銷去八萬本，每秒鐘平均銷售五十五本。</p>
<p>美洲的印第安人常常被雇為機器裝置工人，因為他們有一種天賦的特別技能，能在圓軸上行走，一點也不覺得頭暈。</p>
<p>在澳大利亞洲的蚯蚓，有十呎至十二呎長，粗四分之三吋，可說是世界最大的蚯蚓。</p>
<h3>我怕上海</h3>
<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>筆者最怕來上海，但是為了餬口的關係，依然不斷地到上海來。</p>
<p>故鄉是一個古老的城市，很少二十世紀的享受，所以是為上海人所鄙棄的；而筆者呢，却戀戀於它的「醇樸」。</p>
<p>在故鄉穿了布的制服，過時的皮鞋，決不會遭受到人們的白眼；但是到了上海，情形就不同了：上電車，賣票的會揮揮手呌你到三等裏去；買東西，店員決不會把上好的貨物給你；他們熟透了世情，祗要看看你的寒酸的衣服，就曉得你的荷包是空虛的。</p>
<p>到親戚朋友家裏去，如果親戚朋友不在家，而需要在他們家裏等一等時，男女僕俯，總不願把你讓進客室裏去。那種面部的表情，眞呌你看了難受；就是你進了客室，僕傭們也會不斷地在門縫裏向你張望，宛如一個案犯給偵探們注意着一樣；他們何嘗當你是一個客人，簡直把你與小偷看待了。在上海，是不能穿布衣服的，穿了布衣服，就有偷人東西的嫌疑！</p>
<p>至於香烟，筆者總是抽的下等烟，在故鄉是無所謂的，在上海却要碰釘子。有兩次朋友來看我，我依然把下等烟奉敬，那朋友連忙在荷包裏掏出香烟來說：「一樣的，別客氣！」說着，就一送了一枝過來。我一看是名貴的舶來品，那末，何嘗是一樣」呢？他所說的一樣，不過是一種客氣的　遁詞」，而實際上是不屑吸我這種為所謂上等階級所鄙視的下等烟罷了。</p>
<p>現在正在展開動儉建國運動，報紙上天天有大幅的新聞刊載，烈烈轟轟地很　熱鬧，以為以前的奢修風氣，總已不變。這次又到上海來，把怕的心情，換了忻慰的情緒。但是上海依然是上海，忻慰的情緒，也依然換回了怕的心情！</p>
<h3>聖歏非才子</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>近讀金聖歎文，但覺其只在一味說眞話實話，痛快或有之，奇特則未必。若謂奇特，亦只奇特於不顧庸流譏誚，不念身家性命耳。</p>
<p>世人多謂聖歎是奇人，是才子，實則只因世人太庸俗，膽小如鼠，過於看重自己飯碗性命之故。聖歏決非奇人，亦非才子。世人把聖歎當作奇人才子看，正是　歎倒霉處，其所以遭不意之慘者，正坐此因也。</p>
<p>少時讀聖歎議論，亦曾認為有奇狂之氣。今日更讀之，只覺其平易近情，不如時下日常所聞所讀論調之暴戾囂張，悖謬怪誕。此蓋由於少時先讀聖經賢傳，便以為人世眞個如此，把理想誤作事實，及後始知往昔聖賢所說乃是另一天地中的事情。故今日更讀聖經賢傳，愈讀愈覺其所說之奇詭驚人，轉不若聖歏之近於現實切於事理也。</p>
<p>今日成人如仍有以聖歏為奇人才子者，其人必是去古未遠尚在徬徨於天國的初中學生，要不然便是低能兒，偽君子，壞蛋，惡漢，老奸巨滑，多年積賊，乃是故意揚言聖歎是奇人才子，其居心就不堪問聞。</p>

<h3>經濟來源斷絕　淸寒學生殷切求職</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我是一個在本埠某大果肄業的苦學生，家中寄藉關外，年前為了一個求知的慾望，我離開了北平來滬投考大學，結巢如願就讀了。家父原為某工廠司賬，去年工廠解散，於是失業，五口之家的生活間題，自然十分嚴重。但家父終以最大努力，萊維持我攻習未竟的學業，現屆開學，學校照例繳費上課，因為我經濟的來源，又完全依賴家庭我只好往家中去信，我殷望家裏會設法為我籌備起這筆錢，望了十天，接到了家中的來信，信箋上寫着寥寥的幾行字，「父親的力量已經用到盡頭，今天我慚愧的向你推却父親的責任了，一日未食我的手無力多寫！眼前祗感覺昏沉沉的一片……</p>
<p>×兒，望你珍重！」</p>
<p>一條氈子，一件綿衣都被我典賣了，我總算絞盡腦汁設法繳納了學費，然而今後的吃金問題該如何解決呢？</p>
<p>編輯先生，我希望您能帮助我一下，以便利用我課餘的時間來做一點工作，我能勝任的很少，不過我很願意做個國語家敎師秘書中小學敎師及醫院實習，我不希望什麼待遇，祗求能維持最低限度的生活。此頌撰安　馬濬上九月廿日</p>

<h3>President Personally Tells Shanghai-Based Shandong Representatives of Firm Resolve to Defend Jinan, Supporting Troops Speeding to Aid; He Yingqin Flew Over Jinan Yesterday for Reconnaissance</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] President, at 5 PM on the 22nd, received four Shanghai-based Shandong representatives at his official residence: Ding Weifen, Qin Dechun, Mei Wende, and Liu Zhideng. The President stated that the government is resolved to defend Jinan. Jinan has sufficient supplies of ammunition and food, and the military strength is also quite strong. Supporting troops are speeding to reinforce Jinan. It is believed that the bandits' attempt will surely fail.

<h3>The Communist Army's Pipe Dream of Entering Sichuan and Crossing the Yangtze River Ends in Vain; Joint Sichuan-Hubei Defense Becomes Increasingly Concrete</h3>
<p>[Our Yichang Dispatch of the 22nd] This reporter has separately consulted with the military and political leaders of western and northern Hubei on the communist bandits' proclaimed plans to enter Sichuan and cross the Yangtze River. The general judgment is that under the current circumstances, with the National Army in the Central Plains suppressing the remaining bandits with a reformed deployment, the communist bandits will definitely not disperse their forces and open up another roaming area in their plans, and their own strength absolutely does not permit it. Since the National Army in the Jianghan area severely attacked the remaining bandits along the Xiang River and thoroughly destroyed their warehouses, factories, and accumulated materials, the main bandit forces in the Jianghan area, such as Li Renlin and Li Zhenqian, have crossed the Xiang River or detoured into the Dahong Mountain area. With the Yangtze River water level low this winter, there are not many concerns about the river defense. The bandit's pipe dream of entering Sichuan has never materialized. Liu Fei has always been crouching near Fangcheng in southern Henan. The National Army has deployed powerful formations in Luohe, Xinyang, Nanyang, and Xiangyang on the Pinghan Line, making it difficult for the remaining bandits to move rashly. The Kong Fei forces in Shaanxi have been fleeing to the northeast in disarray as the troops leaving Sichuan advance north and cross the Han River in pursuit. There are only a few scattered bandits in northwestern Hubei, lurking near Zhengyang, Fangxian, and Nanzhang, with weak strength, making it difficult to expect a large-scale action. The Sichuan defense is as solid as a rock. However, according to what this reporter learned in Xiangyang, the bandits have set up a large-scale cadre training class near Junxian, specializing in collecting cadres from Sichuan and Shaanxi and providing detailed instruction in the history, geography, customs, folk culture, and general social organization of Sichuan Province. The size of the organization and the strictness of the curriculum are sufficient to show that the communist bandits' dream of entering Sichuan is still difficult to dispel for the time being, and this news is also sufficient to alert military, political, and social circles.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch of the 22nd] The joint Sichuan-Hubei defense is becoming increasingly concrete. Zhu Shaoliang specially dispatched Chief of Staff Fan Songyao to fly from Chongqing to Wuhan on the 23rd to visit Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi.</p>
<h3>Shenyang Hunhe Airport Completes Night Navigation Equipment</h3>

<h3>Revised General Budget to be Sent to Legislative Yuan for Deliberation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The revised general budget for the second half of the 37th year after being changed to gold yuan, after the revised principles were passed in last week's Political Affairs Conference and handed over to the competent departments for drafting, was submitted to the meeting on the 22nd for discussion and was approved. It is learned that the expenditure part is more than 1.5 billion yuan, and the income part is about 1.2 billion yuan. This revised budget will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation.</p>
<h3>Li Pinxian, Liu Shiyi, and Others Appointed Political Commissars of the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Song Si Appointed Deputy Director of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The Executive Yuan held its 17th meeting on the 22nd, chaired by Weng Wenhao, and passed the following appointments and removals: (1) Li Pinxian, Liu Shiyi, Yuan Shouqian, Zhang Dulun, Fang Jue, Xu Huizhi, Li Jingshi, Wu Zunan, Zhang Guangyu, Guo Bingting, Zhu Youping, Zhang Zhongxuan, and Gao Hongyi are appointed as members of the Political Affairs Committee of the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and Li Pinxian, Liu Shiyi, and Yuan Shouqian are designated as standing committee members, with Yuan Shouqian concurrently serving as Secretary-General.

<h3>The Sufferings of the People Should Certainly Be Considered, But Current National Policies Must Be Implemented</h3>
<p>Bai Chongxi Discusses Conscription and Grain Collection Issues</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 22nd] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi recently issued another statement on the issue of conscription and grain collection, stating: The goal of total war is to seek sufficient food and troops to strive for final victory, and a small number of people are actually using reducing or exempting conscription and grain collection as a slogan for their personal political activities, which greatly affects the future of bandit suppression. Mr. Bai cited that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the total amount of actual collection and purchase in the southwestern provinces was 45 million dan per year, and Sichuan Province alone could bear 24 million shi, supporting 5 million troops. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, all grain-producing areas such as Dongting, Poyang, Taihu, and Chaohu are in our hands, and we are still worried about the lack of military grain and civilian food. Is this not an abnormal phenomenon? Mr. Bai repeatedly emphasized that the hardships of the people should certainly be considered, but current national policies should be implemented, and he earnestly hopes that public opinion organs will assist in the implementation of actual collection and jointly plan for the success of the suppression.</p>

<h3>Regulations for Reorganizing Foreign Currency and National Currency Public Bonds; Legislators Propose Amendments, to be Discussed at Tomorrow's Legislative Yuan Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold the fifth regular meeting of the second session at 9:00 AM on the 24th. A closed meeting will be held first to hear (1) reports from the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of National Defense, and the Chief of Staff on the Jinan war situation and the dispatch of troops for rescue, and (2) the President of the Executive Yuan's report and answers on the policies adopted by the government at the Third United Nations General Assembly, and to discuss the secret case of delimiting the undetermined border between China and Myanmar. Then the regular meeting will be opened, and the discussion items stipulated in the agenda are: (1) continuing the discussion of the Farmland Reform Bill, (2) amending the Executive Yuan's promulgated regulations for reorganizing foreign currency and national currency public bonds, (3) determining the principles for handling motions from members of this Yuan, and (4) providing relief to flood victims in various provinces and reducing or exempting farmland taxes in disaster areas.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Legislator Liu Zhendong and 88 others recently proposed to the Legislative Yuan to amend the regulations for reorganizing foreign currency and national currency public bonds promulgated by the Executive Yuan to demonstrate fairness and reduce the burden on the national treasury. The Legislative Yuan will submit the case for discussion at the regular meeting on the 24th. The case points out: The exchange rate for foreign currency (US dollar) public bonds is particularly favorable in the regulations for reorganizing public bonds promulgated by the Executive Yuan based on the emergency decree on finance and economics. On the eve of the currency change, the market price averaged more than 400,000 legal currency per yuan. Overnight, it was changed to 12 million legal currency for payment. The exchange rate for national currency (legal currency) public bonds was at most 27,000 times, that is, a public bond of 30,000 yuan in national currency was only paid one cent in gold yuan, which was far less favorable than foreign currency public bonds. It is obvious that the fairness of the matter is lost. No wonder public opinion is in an uproar and criticisms are leveled. The case also states: During the period of suppressing the rebellion, the government's finances are difficult. There is nothing wrong with the government recovering or exchanging national currency public bonds at market prices. However, the favorable repayment of foreign currency public bonds has unnecessarily increased the huge burden on the national treasury. The government must reconsider and take into account the fairness of the repayment of foreign currency and national currency public bonds, so two methods are provided: (1) The Legislative Yuan should resolve to consult the Executive Yuan to formulate fair and reasonable methods for repaying foreign currency and national currency public bonds and send them to the Yuan for review. (2) The original regulations for reorganizing foreign currency and national currency public bonds should be abolished immediately, and the procedures for repaying foreign currency and national currency public bonds should not be carried out until the new regulations are passed by the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>Yixian Attacked by Communist Bandits in Succession, Liaoxi Great Battle Imminent, Communist Bandits in Jilin Move South to Meihekou</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 22nd] Communist bandits in the Northeast are on the move and brewing another harassment. The communist 6th Column, attached to an artillery brigade, moved south from the Jilin area to Meihekou. The 5th Column arrived in the area north of Qingyuan, with a situation of harassing to the southwest along the Jilin-Shenyang Road.

Furthermore, the 3rd Column is currently being transferred from Siping to Chaoyang in eastern Rehe. The great battle in Liaoxi is imminent. Also, news: the communist 1st Column infiltrated from Xinlitun towards the Daling River. When this reporter flew east of Jinzhou by plane, artillery fire was seen flashing distantly on the Daling River bank southeast of Yixian, and the artillery battle between the two sides was fierce.</p>

<h3>Properly Handling the Problem of Refugee Students</h3>
<p>Recently, waves of refugee students have arisen in various places, especially in Nanjing. The phenomenon of refugee students flourished during the Anti-Japanese War and has spread to the present day of the suppression of the rebellion. These are our loyal next generation, and they must be properly handled. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, there were no less than a million refugee students in the rear. Fortunately, the central education authorities at the time knew that "the way to govern the people lies in ensuring their well-being," so they allocated huge amounts of money and used great efforts to set up stations for recruitment, establish schools for teaching, and implement policies and measures in an orderly and systematic manner. Everyone was able to find their place, and the sequence of education, which the nation's culture relied on and the young people's lives depended on, was able to proceed step by step, just like in normal times. Although some people criticized the education at the time for being crude and focusing on quantity over quality, looking back on it now, it is truly commendable that the country was facing great difficulties, yet learning continued without interruption and there were no student protests.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why refugee students during the Anti-Japanese War were able to study with peace of mind and not cause trouble. First, the Ministry of Education provided effective leadership and arrangements, and the staff were generally loyal to the country and understood the intentions of their superiors while comforting those below. Second, everyone had hatred but no resentment towards the enemy. Although every student lived in a completely refugee situation, they all looked forward to a beautiful future, hoping that the country would turn over and everyone could live like "human beings." They were psychologically prepared to endure hardships, so they were able to tolerate various unreasonable situations, and they found sweetness in all the hardships. Third, the greatest problem in the world lies not in scarcity but in inequality. At that time, everyone was poor and suffered, and officials, civilians, teachers, and students lived the same life. There were not many places of inequality, and even if there were corrupt officials and treacherous merchants who made a fortune from the national crisis, their numbers were small, and the feeling of injustice was reduced. With these three reasons, they peacefully overcame the difficulties.</p>
<p>After experiencing countless disasters and overcoming the line of national subjugation, we saw the restoration of our territory and the rebuilding of our rivers and mountains. Who knew that the god of victory would bring an even more pitiful fate! Old wounds had not yet healed, and new pains came again. The Communist bandits rebelled, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Every family cried, every household cried, and everyone cried! Such a restored land of rivers and mountains was depicted so tragically!</p>
<p>The Northeast was in urgent need, and millions of students were nervously squeezed into the corner of despair. They endured hardships and traveled into Guannei, hoping to find some warmth in the embrace of the government. Who knew that once they entered Guannei, they would run into walls everywhere, unable to get food when hungry or clothing when cold. How could they talk about studying? With each day of expectation, they felt more disappointment, and they came closer to hunger, cold, disease, and death, which ultimately led to the "July 5th" tragedy in Beiping. We do not want to investigate the responsibility for the "July 5th" incident, but we cannot help but ask: Who was responsible for the education and upbringing of refugee students in Beiping? Did the supervising officials mention this key point at all?</p>
<p>When Kaifeng was lost, the Central Plains were in a state of emergency, the Battle of Shandong was underway, and Xuzhou was in a tight spot. Again, millions of students had no home to return to and no school to attend. They were still living a wartime life, and their lives were soaked in tears. With sadness and emotion in their hearts, they half-walked and half-crawled to the capital. However, the education authorities were suddenly unprepared, and the students had no way to survive. They felt pain, disappointment, decadence, anxiety, depression, and helplessness in the long night. So, on the one hand, they formed begging teams, going from door to door asking for alms, but the wealthy and powerful were unkind and refused to give anything. Also, because students had impersonated others to solicit donations before, their credibility was lost, and they obtained very little. On the other hand, they demanded relief and surrounded the Ministry of Education, which suddenly became a refugee camp. Poor people have bad tempers, and there were bound to be hot-blooded actions, which made things extremely embarrassing. "People have a heart of self-preservation and are in a state of poverty and hardship, so they are all uneasy in their positions and therefore easily moved." This is by no means a coincidence.</p>
<p>Initially, the Ministry of Education gave each person 600,000 legal tender per day for relief. This meager amount could only buy six sesame cakes, which was not enough for a day's sustenance. However, the government had to add 4.8 billion out of thin air every day, which was also barely enough. Now, it has been changed to distributing three dou of white rice per month and 800,000 yuan of supplementary food money per day to each person, and they are housed in municipal primary and secondary schools in Beijing. The principals, together with special commissioners sent by the Ministry, are responsible for taking care of them. The Ministry of Education convened a meeting of responsible persons, and Minister Zhu attached great importance to this matter, personally guiding them and showing great care for the youth. Only then did the refugee students calm down. Unexpectedly, the students, having enough to eat and wear, began to think about watching plays. Because they had no money to go to the theater, on September 7th, the National Grand Theater was smashed for refusing to let them watch for free, leading to a city-wide theater strike. Usually, they form groups to smash public buses, rice shops, and hot water shops. According to the Beijing Daily, there have been as many as fifty large and small all-out brawls in the past two months. The day before yesterday, there was a conflict with a grocery store, resulting in a tragic incident. Yesterday, they smashed the China Daily, as if they had no books to read and the heroes had to find another place to use their skills.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most of the refugee students in the capital are middle school students. Some are so young that you would not believe they are middle school students, while others are as old as thirty and still call themselves middle school students. Some have even graduated and worked in society for several years but still call themselves students. With such a mixed bag, it is inevitable that there are other elements mixed in. Some have already returned to their old homes in Shandong and Henan, but they have returned to Nanjing because they have nothing to eat. It is said that many more people are coming south. It is now the season of golden winds and refreshing air, but soon the west wind will be getting stronger, and a single mat and a pair of pants will not be able to resist the cold air. Wandering far away and shrinking in a foreign land, prolonged loss of schooling is not a reasonable thing!</p>
<p>Seeing that the war will not end in the short term, and the longer the war lasts, the wider the war zone expands, the more refugee students will definitely flood in. This is not a small problem, so how can we lightly dismiss it? In particular, we have seen that recently, professional students have been publicly instigating student protests in various places in a planned manner, and we deeply feel that this refugee student problem is an opportunity for them to take advantage of. Whether the education authorities take appropriate measures is related to the current state of order and chaos in the country. Knowing that professional students today are trying to use young people to create student protests and tragic incidents, both to disrupt public order internally and to affect international relations externally, why still give them an "opportunity" to exploit? Doesn't this reflect the government's incompetence!</p>
<p>If the education authorities have the courage to face reality and the courage to improve reality, I believe that changing these phenomena will not only make a great contribution to youth education but also make a great contribution to national stability. The Ministry of Education has already formulated several measures, but the students are unwilling to leave Beijing. We believe that students in safe areas should return as soon as possible, enroll for free, and restore their student status. Various schools in war zones and dangerous non-war zones should relocate as soon as possible and implement a public funding system. In fact, schools should be productive. Japanese elementary schools were already doing this before the war, let alone middle school students and above during extraordinary times? At the same time, students should be aware of the difficulties of the times, and everyone should aspire to be a pillar of the nation, never taking blind actions.</p>
<p>I deeply hope that the government will do its best, society will pay more attention, and students will abide by the rules more. "It is possible to practice righteousness with a people who are at peace, but it is easy to lead a people in danger to do wrong." I pray that everyone will think about it, think deeply about it!</p>

In the past, it was stipulated that it should be calculated in US dollars, and then the US dollars should be converted into legal tender.

<p>Bevin continued to discuss the German issue. Regarding the currency issue, he said that under the principle of joint control by the four countries, "We still intend to recognize the Soviet Mark as the sole currency." Regarding the Berlin blockade, Bevin said that the Western powers are prepared to continue the airlift throughout the winter to resist the Soviet blockade. Regarding the situation of the Moscow talks, Bevin said that it has not yet reached the point where it can be announced and is still under discussion. He stated, "We believe that lifting the Berlin blockade is a necessary condition, and any solution must be based on this." Bevin continued, saying that rumors that Britain, the United States, and France cannot agree are absolutely untrue, and we have always been consistent in any policy steps.</p>

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was one of the last to arrive. The hall was filled with 1,350 guests, including 450 newspaper reporters, who arrived half an hour before the meeting to view the newly decorated hall. The hall is equipped with a small mechanism that simultaneously translates the speakers' words into the five official languages of the conference. Behind the chairman's platform, the flags of the 58 member states are displayed. The UN emblem, a globe, with ears of wheat on either side, is placed in the center.

<h3>The Position of Our UN General Assembly Representatives: Agreeing to the Establishment of a UN Security Guard and Limiting the Scope of Use of the Veto Power</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] This Central News Agency reporter learned from people close to the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly that, after long deliberation, our country's policy has been established regarding the five Asian issues and three global issues at this General Assembly. The Asian issues are: (1) the Korean issue, (2) the Palestine issue, (3) the issue of Indian treatment in South Africa, (4) the issue that the Security Council should pay more attention to the vast region of Asia and give Asian countries seats when selecting non-permanent directors; (5) the issue of the Far East Economic Committee. Regarding the Korean issue, our country's policy is to support an independent, unified, and legitimate government; regarding the Palestine issue, our country's policy is to support the principles of justice and peace and the specific measures of "peace and compromise" formulated to achieve these principles. Our country also sincerely hopes that Indians in South Africa can enjoy better treatment, and also hopes that Asian countries can be elected as non-permanent directors of the Security Council. The three global issues are: (1) the necessity of establishing a UN Security Guard, (2) appropriately limiting the scope of use of the veto power; (3) reaching an agreement quickly on the atomic energy issue.</p>

<h3>Puppet Emperor Puyi Still Detained by Soviets; Spends Days Carving Bamboo to Pass the Time</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] According to a Japanese source who returned from the Soviet Union, Puyi is currently imprisoned in a two-story building in Boli (Khabarovsk), located about 400 miles north of Vladivostok. More than 200 former Japanese Kwantung Army officers are also imprisoned in the same location. The place of imprisonment used to be a second-class hotel.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Former Manchukuo Emperor Puyi and about 200 of his subordinates are still being detained by the Soviet Union in a second-class hotel in Khabarovsk. This information was revealed by Japanese people who recently returned from the Soviet Union. Former Japanese Colonel Yanagida Hidenaga provided detailed descriptions of Puyi's imprisonment, but knew nothing about the Soviet Union's plans for the puppet emperor. Puyi's younger brother, Pujie, and his puppet premier, Zhang Jinghui, also live in the two-story hotel. They must work and spend their days reading, taking walks, playing mahjong, and playing Go to pass the time. Puyi spends his days carving bamboo to pass the time. The puppet emperor receives preferential treatment, with a room to himself, and his food rations are also better than others. Today, most observers do not believe that the Soviet Union intends to reuse Puyi, as such a move would be too blatant, and he has already been criticized as being "available for anyone to use." So far, the Soviet Union has not exploited him or used him to negotiate with the Chinese government. However, the Soviet Union has not unexpectedly prosecuted Puyi as a war criminal, so this puppet emperor remains a mystery in the East.</p>
<h3>Soviets Want Communist Party to Seize Power, Hence Propose Withdrawal of Western Occupation Forces: U.S. Officials Explain Soviet Strategy of Recommending Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st Dispatch] U.S. officials on the 21st explained that the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw all Allied occupation forces from Germany, Japan, and Korea is a strategy to allow the Communist Party to do whatever it wants in Europe and the Far East. It is also believed here that the Soviet Union's proposal aims to trouble the Western Allies before the United Nations General Assembly. Officials said that completely withdrawing the Western occupation forces during this period would remove the main obstacle for the Communist Party to seize power on both ends of the world.</p>
<p>[United Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 21st Dispatch] Representative Judd said on the 21st that "We predicted a year ago that the Soviet Union would announce the withdrawal of its troops stationed in Korea. The Soviet Union's actions are purely propaganda to harm the United States. This will be similar to the Soviet troop withdrawal from Poland and Bulgaria, where Communist Party members occupy key positions in the government and military, and their policies are controlled by Moscow."</p>
<h3>Rumor That the Soviet Union Convened Satellite States for Important Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: According to reports from several national capitals, several leaders of satellite states have left their countries. It is reported that a certain Eastern European leader is also vacationing in the Soviet Union. It is generally speculated that other key figures in the Soviet bloc may also be there, either to attend a meeting of the Communist International Information Bureau or to hold a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. However, according to responsible officials, the above information has not been confirmed. Whether or not Communist Party officials are meeting is unknown, but major Soviet actions often unfold after secret meetings, so the world is extremely concerned about this.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: Western newspapers in Berlin reported that Berlin Communist Party leaders and the Soviet occupation authorities in Germany are scheduled to hold a secret meeting on the 24th to discuss new steps to deal with the Berlin issue. The meeting will be held in Potsdam, where the Soviet military headquarters in Berlin is located, and the agenda and other preparations are being kept strictly secret.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Arab-Jewish Conflict in Palestine: Full Text of Bernadotte's Recommendations; Arab-Jewish Partition Establishes Lasting Peace</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] The full text of Bernadotte's report conclusion is as follows: "Since delivering written recommendations to the Arab and Jewish authorities on June 27, I have not formally presented any concrete recommendations regarding the resolution of the problem to either side. Since that time, I have held multiple meetings with both sides in Arab capitals and Tel Aviv, during which we freely exchanged views on solutions to the dispute. My original recommendation provided a general scope within which the two sides could, if willing to negotiate, find a reasonable and feasible solution. However, both sides have rejected this recommendation. When presenting this recommendation, it was clear that this recommendation was purely exploratory in nature, its main purpose being to solicit the intentions and suggestions of both sides, and in any case, the realization of this recommendation must be agreed upon by both sides, so I never used pressure to promote its realization. I have a clear understanding of a certain basic concept in the recommendation. No matter how necessary the political and economic union of Palestine is, the timing for the realization of this plan has not yet arrived. I have no authority to recommend any action by member states of the United Nations to resolve the Palestine problem. I believe that I have no right to make recommendations to member states of the United Nations. This is the responsibility that member states should bear through appropriate mechanisms. As the current United Nations mediator, I should seek information and draw conclusions from experience, which will be helpful for member states of the United Nations when deciding on actions related to the Palestine problem. Therefore, my responsibility is to enable member states of the United Nations to learn from this report the content of several peaceful solutions. The formulation of this method is based on frequent consultations with Arab and Jewish authorities over the past three and a half months, as well as my observations on the current situation in Palestine. I do not believe that this conclusion can be used as the basis for a recommendation that will be immediately agreed upon by the relevant parties. In my active efforts to seek Arab-Jewish common agreement, I have not yet been able to disturb this plan. I firmly believe that if the recommendations put forward at this time can be adopted by the General Assembly and given strong support, the Arab and Jewish parties will not firmly reject them. I also firmly believe that the Security Council will uphold its resolution of July 15 to cease military action by both sides. There is one point that cannot be ignored, that is, the current situation is very different from that of last November. In these months, the war began and then stopped, and decisive events also occurred during this period. My conclusions are based on the following seven basic premises:</p>
<p>Restoration of Peace (A) Peace must be restored in Palestine, and all possible measures should be taken to ensure that war does not break out again, and that harmonious relations are finally restored between Arabs and Jews.</p>
<p>Jewish State (B) There is no sound reason to assume that the Jewish state named Israel will not continue to exist in Palestine.</p>
<p>Boundary Determination (C) The boundaries of this new country must be finally determined by formal agreement by the parties concerned, or by the United Nations.</p>
<p>Continuous Boundary (D) The main objective of the boundary agreement should be to comply with the principle of geographical unity and integrity. This principle should be equally applied to Arab and Jewish territories. Therefore, the territories of the two countries should not be strictly regulated by the territorial agreement stipulated in the resolution of September 29.</p>
<p>Right to Repatriation (E) The innocent people who have been displaced by the terror and ravages of the current war should have the right to be repatriated. Those who do not wish to return should be guaranteed appropriate compensation for their lost property.</p>
<p>Jerusalem (F) The city of Jerusalem, due to its importance in religion and internationally, and the complexity of its various interests, should be treated separately and specially.</p>
<p>International Responsibility (G) International responsibility, when necessary, should be expressed in the form of international guarantees, so as to alleviate existing fears, especially those concerning borders and human rights.</p>
<p>Affirmative Conclusions The following conclusions are broad outlines. In my opinion, these conclusions, in the context of the full text, are sufficient to provide a reasonable, fair and feasible basis for resolution: (A) Since the Security Council has prohibited the use of force in Palestine as a means of resolving disputes, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter concerning sanctions, the parties concerned should formally declare the outcome of the conflict in a manner mutually agreed upon. Otherwise, it should be formally declared by the United Nations. The current indefinite ceasefire should be replaced by formal peace, or at least by a truce, which should stipulate the complete withdrawal and demobilization of armed forces, or the establishment of a broad demilitarized zone under United Nations supervision as a separation. (B) The boundary line between Arab and Jewish territories, in the absence of an agreement between Arabs and Jews, should be determined by the United Nations, and the United Nations should appoint a technical boundary committee to carry out the boundary demarcation work. The committee should be responsible to the United Nations. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Twelve Underground Banks Uncovered, Ordered to Cease Operations and Fined Separately: Financial Control Bureau Reports to Economic Control Supervisors for Approval and Implementation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After cracking down on four banks in this city, the Financial Control Bureau (金管局) has concentrated its efforts on eliminating black market transactions of underground banks. A few days ago, it dispatched 30 staff members, divided into 15 groups, to conduct large-scale surprise inspections of underground banks in conjunction with the police bureau. More than a dozen locations were uncovered, and a large number of account books and documents were seized. After days of review, the details have been clarified. The Bureau yesterday ordered twelve underground banks to cease operations, and fined them separately according to the severity of their circumstances, and reported to the Economic Control Supervisor for approval and implementation. The illegal business activities of each bank are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Youlian Trading Company (友聯貿易公司): It was found that the company's head office is located in Hankou, and branch offices are located in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhu and other places. Wuhu drafts were found in the documents. The Shanghai branch also engaged in deposit, remittance, and arbitrage businesses. (2) Luo Xiangji (羅象記): This firm handles the transport of cloth pieces for Wuhu merchants. It has not been formally registered with the competent authority, which is already inconsistent with regulations. It was also found to have more than a dozen deposit accounts, calculating deposit and loan interest, and also engaging in Wuhu remittance ticket discounting and lending businesses. (3) Tongxing Pawnshop (同興當店): It was found to be colluding with commercial firms in Wuhu and other places to engage in remittance and collection, and to absorb deposits, which was admitted without denial. (4) Baogengfeng Grain Store (寶庚豐糧食號): This store absorbed deposits from eleven accounts, and colluded with cooperatives and stores in Wuhu, Jingzhen, and other places to engage in remittance business. (5) Runchang Han Cotton Cloth Store (潤昌漢棉布號): This store was originally a money shop before the war, and still secretly engaged in absorbing deposits after the victory, and colluded with pawnshops in Wuhu Danyang and cooperatives in Jingzhen and other places to handle remittance business. (6) Shengmao (甡茂號): The responsible person of this firm is a friend of the responsible person of Runchang Han, and the operations are the same as those of Runchang Han. (7) Hu Huanji Shen Zhuang (胡煥記申莊): This firm is located at the original site of Dahua Silk Store (大華綢莊), absorbed deposits, with 29 accounts including Zhao Hongji (趙鴻記), all of which received and paid interest, and colluded with cooperatives and stores in Wuhu to handle remittance collection. (8) Hong Dachang (鴻大昌號): This firm absorbed deposits, with 29 accounts including Yongji (　永記), the interest paid exceeded that of general firms, and also handled remittances to Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, and other places. (9) Zheng Shou'er (鄭壽耳): Documents were found indicating that he was engaged in remittance, acting as an agent for Wuhu money shops to collect and remit funds, and calculating interest on a regular basis. Zheng Shoushan submitted a guarantee admitting to the task of processing and forwarding, and the so-called forwarding is actually a disguised form of remittance. (10) Yin Jingyuan (尹靜園): Absorbed deposits, opened Xu Youji (徐有記) account at Jianye Bank (建業銀行), and seven accounts including Fan Jikang (番季康) at Fuchang Bank (福昌銀號). Although it was claimed that they were deposits from relatives, it is a fact that Yin Jingyuan handled the absorption of deposits, and regularly remitted funds for 26 cooperatives in Wuhu and Zhenjiang and other places. (11) Li Fengchang (李鳳昌): Colluded with Hu Huanji Shen Zhuang and others to handle remittance business for cooperatives and stores in Wuhu, Zhenjiang and other places. (12) Yuan Shaode (袁紹德): Colluded with money shops and cooperatives in Wuhu, Jingzhen and other places to handle remittance business.</p>
<h3>Several Other Businesses Exceeded the Scope of Their Business</h3>
<p>The above twelve firms absorbed deposits, handled lending, and engaged in remittance. The evidence is solid. There is no doubt that they are operating underground banks. It is confirmed that they have violated Article 15 of the Banking Law, and the Financial Control Bureau will impose penalties according to the same article of the same law. Among them, Youlian and Luo Xiangji are more serious. The Bureau has notified the municipal government to order them to cease operations, and fined their responsible persons 5,000 yuan each. The remaining six firms, Tongxing Pawnshop, Baogengfeng Grain Store, Runchang Han Cotton Cloth Store, Shengmao, Hu Huanji Shen Zhuang, and Hong Dachang, have been notified by the Bureau to the municipal government to order them to cease operations, and fined their responsible persons 3,000 yuan each. Zheng Shoushan, Yin Jingyuan, Li Fengchang, and Yuan Shaode, have no registered names, and the Bureau has notified the municipal government to order the four to immediately cease their underground banking business, submit a written guarantee, and fined them 3,000 yuan each. In addition, although it was found that Zhengtai (正泰號) had no underground banking business, it did engage in buying and selling yarn and cloth for customers, transferring funds, and receiving and paying interest, which also exceeded the scope of its business. The Bureau has notified the municipal government to instruct the firm to submit a written guarantee that the same situation will not occur in the future. The collusion between Hexiang Trust Company (和祥信託公司) and underground banks in other locations will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for discussion. It was found that the transaction funds of Ning Songji (寗松記) are all within the scope of the company's business, and there is no sign of underground banking business, so it should be exempted from discussion. Yongye Company (永業公司) is still under detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>The Financial Control Bureau Advises People Not to Be Lured by High Profits</h3>
<p>Regarding the punishment of underground banks this time, according to Director Lin of the Bureau, the establishment of underground banks is due to the abnormal economic and financial situation. People seek high profits and are willing to deposit or entrust the money earned from their blood and sweat to illegal hands, which has led to a chaotic situation. Today, management work has been effective, and financial business is gradually on the right track. Illegal organizations will inevitably be eliminated. It is hoped that people will no longer be tempted by higher interest rates, and will risk depositing in underground banks, so that their principal and interest are not guaranteed. They must do business with legal firms, which will not only ensure the safety of their own assets, but also greatly help the future of economic management.</p>
<h3>Violation of the Exchange Act: Four Defendants Tried and Awaiting Judgment: Zeng Chuan Police Already Original Handling Officer Testified</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of stockbroker Lin Legeng and Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, Xu Yangshuyao, and others being accused of violating the Exchange Act was heard again in the second court of the district court yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM by Chief Judge Shen Tianbao and Assessors Mei Erhe and Fang Xianghai. After the final defense, the judgment was scheduled to be announced at 10:00 AM on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>When the court opened yesterday, the court summoned Hu Zengda, an employee of Hongxing Securities (鴻興證券號), Shen Shuren, an employee of Huamei Industrial Trading Company (華美工業貿易公司), and Lou Chenghan, the original handling officer of the police bureau's intelligence group, and Wang Sizu, the action group leader, to appear in court to testify.</p>
<p>No Other Evidence Except Chalkboard and Other Items</p>
<p>According to Wang Sizu, he was ordered to investigate the off-exchange transactions of the defendants in this case. Regarding Du Weiping, 29 million shares were dumped one after another, but there were no transaction orders or accounts to verify, which was an off-exchange transaction. Huamei is a trading company, and Du is the general manager. The police bureau, the garrison headquarters, and the financial control bureau dispatched personnel and found that Huamei was equipped with a chalkboard, loudspeaker, telephone, and other securities company equipment, and the windows were marked with the words "Police Out" and "Settlement." Later, two employees of the company also admitted that Huamei had off-exchange transactions. Regarding Lin Legeng, the investigation first focused on short selling, and then it was discovered that Lin Legeng, an employee of the broker number 190, bought 16 million shares on August 16 and 17, all of which were off-exchange transactions. Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao confessed to the bureau that they and Li Boqin, who is on the run, dumped 7 million shares in Huamei on the 19th, and there were no accounts to verify. As for the written record of the confession, a copy was sent to the district court, and the original is still stored in the police bureau. Finally, in response to the inquiry from Du's defense lawyer, he said that no other suspected evidence was found in Huamei except for the chalkboard and other items.</p>
<p>Hu Zengda Testified That He Did Not Know About Dumping Shares</p>
<p>Next, Lou Chenghan stated that the police bureau was ordered by the Presidential Office to investigate the "Dumping Shares Case" within a time limit. After investigating with various parties, it was believed that Du and Lin were suspected. When Du and Lin were summoned on September 2, personnel from all parties jointly interrogated them, and he was responsible for recording the proceedings. The first draft was recorded in shorthand, and then reread once. Du and Lin had no objections. Later, the first draft was deemed to be too messy, so it was reorganized. When the reorganized confession was reread during the second summons that afternoon, the phrase "off-exchange transaction" was crossed out. Qiu Yuntiao, the manager of Hongxing Securities, who was summoned to court last time, did not arrive, so Hu Zengjian, an employee of the firm, was summoned. He stated that he was 27 years old and had been an apprentice in Hongxing for three or four months. He listened to market quotations and wrote on the chalkboard every day, and did not understand the procedures for buying and selling. On the 19th, Manager Qiu ordered him to sell one million shares, but he returned unsuccessful because the market quotation plummeted at that time. He replied that he did not know about dumping 16 million shares.</p>
<p>Huamei Does Not Do Stock Business</p>
<p>Subsequently, Shen Shuren, an employee of Huamei, testified that he was 18 years old and worked in Huamei as a general affairs employee. Huamei originally engaged in the import and export of electrical appliances and automobiles, etc., but has now ceased operations. Hongxing and Huamei are both operated by Du. Hongxing did not have a suitable location before, so it planned to move to Huamei to open a branch. It had already moved the chalkboard and other items to Huamei. Later, Hongxing rented Room 501 in the Securities Building, so the plan to move was cancelled. The chalkboard and other items seized by the police bureau in Huamei were originally intended to be used for the establishment of the Hongxing branch. Huamei does not do stock business. At 9:20 AM on the 19th, Li Boqin brought two women to Huamei to borrow a phone to call Hongxing to dump shares. Later, a worker from Hongxing brought the money to Huamei and handed it to Li Boqin. He personally does not do stock business. The court then summoned the defendants. Lin Legeng stated that he bought 16 million shares from Manager Qiu of Hongxing on August 16 and 17. Because the capital was not sufficient, he cancelled the transaction immediately, and never bought or sold again, let alone shorted.</p>
<p>Off-Exchange Transactions - Completely Unaware</p>
<p>Tao Liguolan stated that she dumped 2 million shares on the morning of the 19th, and then made up for it near noon. Because it was entrusted to a broker, she did not know whether it was an off-exchange transaction. Xu Yangshuyao stated that she was a spot trader, not short selling. She also did not understand what short selling was. Zhu had done stock business before. The remaining testimonies of Li and Yang were the same as the last time. Finally, Du Weiping stated that he only went to the police bureau to supplement the written record of the confession, and had not reviewed the rest. He could not be responsible for the confession made by the police bureau. If there were off-exchange transactions, he was completely unaware of them. He had never met the other defendants, and did not know anything about the dumping of shares. Qiu Yunfeng has repeatedly failed to appear in court, or may be fleeing the crime. After the confession, the court questioned each defendant again, and then the prosecutor, Ding Tongjun, briefly stated the intention of the prosecution. The lawyers of each defendant then debated one after another, starting at 3:30 PM. The debate ended at 5:15 PM, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 28th. The defendants' request for bail was denied, and they were ordered to be returned to custody.</p>
<p>Xu Yangshuyao Sobbed Uncontrollably</p>
<p>When the court opened yesterday, Du had sores on his legs. He underwent surgery in the detention center a few days ago and had difficulty moving. When he walked from the waiting room to the defendant's bar, he was supported by Lin Legeng. The court specially granted him a seat. He was in good spirits. Xu Yangshuyao changed to a white-bottomed, large red floral cheongsam, and she and Tao Liguolan were barefoot, wearing the same style of round-mouthed black embroidered shoes. Because Yang was pregnant, she was also granted a seat by the court to rest after being questioned. Later, when her defense lawyer, Ru Baoyi, told the court about her "family ruin" and life story, she could not help but feel sad and sobbed uncontrollably. More than 100 family members of the defendants attended the hearing, not as crowded as the first hearing. After the adjournment, they left one after another in the pouring rain.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhan Peilin, the chairman of the Paper Industry Association, is currently detained in the Special Criminal Court for investigation due to a hoarding case. He was questioned by the prosecutor yesterday morning. It is reported that there have been new developments in the case recently. According to the investigation by the police bureau, in addition to the previously discovered hoarding, 500 reams of white newspaper secretly stored by Zhan have been seized. Since the hoarded materials have been broken down into smaller amounts, there may be other secret storage locations. The police bureau has sent a letter to the Special Court for investigation. According to Zhan's confession yesterday: "The 500 reams of white newspaper are indeed mine, but they are all substandard products." The prosecutor then asked if there was any other hoarding? Zhan insisted that all had been seized. After the interrogation, he was still returned to custody. It is reported that the investigation part of the case has been completed, and a public prosecution will be filed in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Summons Wan Molin and Li Ming</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to disrupted rice supply channels, the price of rice reached the limit yesterday, with scarce transactions in the market. Supervisor Chiang is highly concerned about this issue. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, he specially instructed Cheng Yi-kuan, captain of the Economic Inspection Brigade, and Lou Cheng-han, leader of the Intelligence Group, to invite Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Industry Association of this city, to the Supervisor's office for discussions. Wan arrived at the Central Bank at 6:00 PM and waited in the waiting room. At 6:50 PM, accompanied by Cheng Yi-kuan, he met with Chiang Ching-kuo. He hastily departed five minutes later. It is generally speculated that the authorities have tasked him with stabilizing rice prices. If the price surge is not suppressed or the supply is not sustained, Wan will be held responsible. Furthermore, Li Ming, chairman of the Banking Association of this city, was also invited yesterday to report on the transfer of foreign exchange assets of banks and financial institutions.</p>
<h3>Scalpers Drill Through Any Crack: Falsely Establishing Businesses to Obtain Subsidized Cigarettes for Profit; Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Reviews Applications</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] There is a shortage of cigarettes in this city. Since the cigarette companies started distributing goods at limited prices, it has attracted the attention of scalpers. They are falsely establishing businesses, even setting up small stalls, and applying for registration with the Social Affairs Bureau to obtain subsidized cigarettes for profit. In recent days, the Business Registration Office of the Social Affairs Bureau has been bustling with activity, with many scalpers mixed in, going through registration procedures. The Social Affairs Bureau, aware of the malpractice, is strictly reviewing applications for business registration to prevent scalpers from speculating. Newly established cigarette businesses must have sufficient capital and guarantees from two members of the Cigarette Association, with seals to prove their legitimacy, before they can apply for registration. Established cigarette businesses must have a special business license from the Finance Bureau and business tax receipts for April to June of the 37th year, which must be certified by the Social Affairs Bureau before they can apply for subsidized goods.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Western Medicine Due Again to Scalpers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, there has been a shortage of Western medicine in the city, making it difficult to purchase at retail stores, even affecting the diagnosis and treatment work of hospitals. Yesterday, the reporter met with Cheng Yi-kuan, captain of the Economic Inspection Brigade, to inquire whether the shortage of Western medicine was due to hoarding by pharmacies. According to Cheng, the main reason for not being able to buy Western medicine is likely a shortage of goods, not hoarding by pharmacies. Especially for large-scale pharmacies, hoarding behavior would be easily detected. Recently, it was discovered that a major Chinese pharmacy in this city had a large batch of goods stored in a warehouse, but after investigation, it was found that they were all tonics rather than special medicines. I believe that a large number of Western medicines in this city are likely in the hands of scalpers, sold on the black market, where they can fetch about double the limited price, and the high profits attract them like moths to a flame.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Arrest Scalpers at Department Store</h3>

<h3>Revision of Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Houses and Real Estate: Occupants Still Allowed Priority Purchase</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 22nd (Our Dispatch)] Economic Supervisor of the Shanghai Region, Yu Hongjun, and others were instructed by Presidential Decree to expedite the handling of enemy and puppet real estate. They have recently drafted revised measures for handling enemy and puppet houses and real estate and submitted them to the Executive Yuan via telegram. The telegram stated briefly: These real properties are currently occupied. The measures previously issued by the Executive Yuan originally allowed occupants priority purchase. However, due to the rapid depreciation of currency, the valuation and collection time was lengthy, causing significant losses to the government, so it was changed to a uniform auction. However, due to the severe housing shortage, it was inconvenient to proceed. Now that the currency system has been reformed and the currency value is stable, it is proposed to revise the measures as follows: (1) Valuation will be based on the market value, plus 10%; occupants will be notified to purchase within ten days, first paying half of the security deposit, with the remainder to be paid in full within one month from the date of notification. Failure to pay within the deadline will result in forfeiture of the security deposit. Failure to purchase within ten days will be considered a waiver, and the property will be publicly tendered, with occupants still allowed to participate in the bidding. (2) Once the property is sold at auction, occupants must move out within one month to allow delivery to the successful bidder; violators will be forcibly evicted by the Economic Supervisor's office. These measures will be implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Owners of Land Requisitioned for the Yinxiang Airfield Petition the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Central Government is receiving and using enemy and puppet-occupied land in Shanghai. The Municipal Council, based on the resolution of the Seventh Congress, is negotiating with various using agencies to expedite the clearing or return of the land in accordance with the deliberation decisions. Among them, the land for the Yinxiang Airfield in Jiangwan is still necessary for use, and the authorities have decided to requisition it. However, the Land Bureau has not yet processed the requisition procedures. The owners of the land appointed Chen Weihan, Li Xiangzhou, Lu Chunming, and five others as representatives yesterday to submit a petition to the Municipal Council, raising five demands, requesting that the real situation be considered and that the relevant authorities be informed to handle it quickly and effectively.</p>
<h3>Funds for Recovering the Racecourse Should Be Raised Independently: Instruction from the Executive Yuan Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of recovering the racecourse on Xizang Road, the Municipal Government originally intended to exchange it with the original owner by confiscating the state-owned enemy and puppet property, the Jiangwan Racecourse. However, this enemy property was approved by the Executive Yuan to be sold to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Joint Logistics Command, so the case was shelved midway. The Municipal Council, based on the resolutions of the Sixth and Seventh Congresses, successively petitioned the Executive Yuan to revoke the order to sell the Jiangwan Racecourse and requested that the original proposal to exchange the Jiangwan Racecourse for the racecourse on Xizang Road be maintained. It is now known that after reviewing these suggestions, the Executive Yuan deemed it inappropriate to approve them and instructed the Municipal Government yesterday, stating briefly: "If it is necessary to recover the racecourse on Xizang Road for municipal construction, funds should be raised independently to purchase it; the enemy and puppet property that has already been confiscated and nationalized should not be used for exchange."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Youth Service Corps Training Begins Yesterday: Chiang Ching-kuo Delivers Encouraging Speech</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The training of the Shanghai Youth Service Corps cadres began yesterday. A total of 500 cadres and members attended the opening ceremony in Jiangwan in the morning. Chiang Ching-kuo attended and delivered a speech, encouraging the youth of the corps to illuminate the dark world with the torch of justice. He also stated that today's economic policy of the government is not satisfied with inspecting warehouses and stabilizing prices. This is only a means to achieve the goal, not the goal itself. Our goal is to create a new society of the Three Principles of the People that young people idealize. In this society, there is no exploitation, no oppression, no fraud, and no unreasonable phenomena. Everyone enjoys a free and happy life. He then said that if we engage in this work today, we will surely gain the support of the broad masses of the people, because we have nothing and seek nothing. We have no industry, no land, except for a healthy body, wisdom, and determination, so we should work without any scruples. At the same time, we strive only for the happiness of the country and the people, not for promotion or wealth, so we have nothing to fear. At this point, he encouraged the youth to be humble and calm with a sincere attitude, and criticized arrogance, complacency, decadence, and corruption. He also said that determination is the source of strength. We should act like an army fighting a war. The gain or loss of a city or a piece of land is not enough to determine the overall battle situation, but we should carry out our mission with the determination to hold on to the last fortress. Finally, he said in the most touching tone: "I can swear to you today that if I have the slightest bit of corruption, you can all shoot me with your guns."</p>
<p>Group Discussions</p>
<p>After Chiang's speech, group discussions were held on the topic of "The Prospect of New Shanghai." There were three conclusions: (1) Evils of Old Shanghai: A. The economy controlled by profiteers deprives most people of happiness. B. The politics controlled by bureaucrats deprives most people of their rights. C. The society controlled by gangsters deprives most people of their freedom. (2) Outline of New Shanghai: A. New Shanghai belongs to the common people. B. The politics of New Shanghai should be everyone abiding by the law, stability everywhere, and freedom for all. C. The economy of New Shanghai should be everyone having clothes to wear, food to eat, houses to live in, and work to do, with capital invested in production, production matching consumption, and consumption adapting to national wealth. D. The society of New Shanghai should be the majority suppressing the minority, the good defeating the violent, and the people suppressing the bureaucrats. (3) The transformation of Shanghai and the great reform of China require the revolutionary youth of all of Shanghai and all of China to unite, stand with the people, and strive for happiness and freedom for the vast number of poor and suffering people with their blood and lives. The organization of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps is a revolutionary social movement for this purpose.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Thousands of college students from Chongqing, Hangzhou, Hankou, Peiping, and other places responded to Chiang Ching-kuo's call and sent letters to the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps yesterday, expressing that similar organizations will be established in various places and supporting this social movement.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Transactions Becoming More Active: Demand for One or Two Mu of Vacant Land Is Strongest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Real estate transactions in this city have become more active in the past week. According to industry insiders, transactions of vacant land account for the majority, followed by the sale of vacant houses. Transactions of occupied real estate remain sluggish, and prices are also weak. According to investigations, the number of transfer cases at the Land Administration Bureau has increased significantly recently, with transactions of one or two mu of vacant land being the most numerous, followed by vacant houses worth around 100,000 yuan. Transactions of occupied real estate are scarce. For example, vacant land in better locations along Beijing Road, Guangdong Road, and Zhongshan East Road is currently priced at 140,000 to 160,000 yuan per mu, with few sellers and many buyers. However, in the same locations, the price of occupied real estate is as low as 40,000 yuan per mu, with many sellers eager to sell, but still few buyers. It is reported that larger real estate transactions currently underway include vacant land along Fuxu Road in Hartung Garden, but the asking prices are extraordinarily high. It is said that the asking price for vacant land along Fuxu Road is 160,000 yuan per mu, and the asking price for vacant land further inland is 90,000 to 100,000 yuan per mu. It is claimed that the actual value is about 120,000 yuan per mu for the former and about 70,000 yuan per mu for the latter.</p>
<h3>Accusation Against Zhang Renyou and Eight Others for Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty; Includes Four Businessmen, Boatmen, and Workers; District Procuratorate Lists Seven Criminal Facts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Renyou, Director of the Water Police Bureau, and others were previously accused of aiding bandits, embezzlement, and dereliction of duty. After a preliminary investigation by the District Procuratorate, the accusations of aiding bandits against Zhang Renyou, Shan Guohua, and Wang Baoqian were transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation according to the law. The investigation into the embezzlement and dereliction of duty charges has concluded. The defendants Zhang Renyou, Huang Boqian, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Water Police Bureau, Xia Zhimin, acting staff member of the branch bureau, Xie Yiyun, patrol officer of the Yangjing Police Station, Qin Shuming, foreman, Zhou Qing, boatman, Luo Zhaoqiang, patrol officer of the Xinzha branch of the Water Police Bureau, Tan Wenxi, shareholder of Bailai Motor Company, and Liang Jinhao, Deputy Manager of Bailai Motor Company, nine people in total, have been publicly prosecuted on charges of embezzlement and dereliction of duty according to the law.</p>
<p>This case was reported secretly to the President, who forwarded it through the Third Bureau of the Presidential Palace to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which then ordered the Shanghai Higher Court Procuratorate to instruct the District Procuratorate to investigate. The facts of Zhang et al.'s crimes and the evidence, as announced by the Procuratorate, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Zhang Renyou Concealing Evidence: Gu Anan and Song Rende had a prior grudge over a minor matter. On the morning of May 17th of this year, Gu Anan gathered dozens of hooligans, wielding knives to injure Song Rende. This was witnessed by Wang Youbin, a patrol officer of the Water Police Bureau. The victim identified Gu Anan and Tao Qiyun as the assailants, and Ding Xiangtao, owner of Hengcheng Fish Shop, and his wife Ding Zhu as the instigators. The Judicial Section of the Bureau arrested Tao Qiyun and Ding Zhu. However, Zhang Renyou arbitrarily released these two on bail, without further investigation or transfer to the court.</p>
<p>Concealing and Ignoring U.S. Dollar Transactions</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Zhang Renyou et al.'s Dereliction of Duty and Tan Wenxi et al.'s Violation of U.S. Dollar Transactions: Since 1936, Bailai Motor Company has been operating a car rental service for American military personnel at Pier 10 on the Bund. Liang Jinhao, the Deputy Manager of the company, was responsible for management, with 30 vehicles. There were approximately five or six rentals per day, with a rental fee of 45 cents in U.S. dollars each time. In July of this year, the company illegally constructed a wooden kiosk by the floating bridge at the aforementioned pier. The Water Police Bureau, upon discovering this, considered it a violation of police regulations due to the lack of an application for permission to build. They summoned Liang Jinhao and Tan Wenxi. Luo Zhaoqiang, a patrol officer of the bureau, was assigned to handle the case. He investigated the circumstances, with the intention of favoritism, completely disregarding the U.S. dollar transactions, and proposed only to demolish the illegally built wooden kiosk and suspend business operations. Shen Huan, the Chief of the First Section of the Bureau, believed that the punishment proposed by Luo Zhaoqiang was too lenient and independently requested Director Zhang Renyou to detain them for two days as a warning according to police regulations for illegally building a wooden kiosk, and to report the U.S. dollar car rental portion to the Economic Section for verification. Unexpectedly, Zhang Renyou intentionally colluded to cover up the matter, falsely claiming that the General Bureau had instructed via telephone to exempt the case from being sent and that there was no need for detention, directly handling it according to the method proposed by Luo Zhaoqiang, concealing the U.S. dollar transaction portion, and not transferring it to the Economic Section of the Police Headquarters for legal action.</p>
<p>Accepting Bribes to Release a Batch of Firearms</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Zhang Renyou and Xia Zhimin Accepting Bribes: Guo Yinzhang and Xu Youjun were patrol officers of the Huangpu North District branch of the Water Police Bureau. On May 9th of this year, they discovered a sailboat, Zhen Zi No. 856, anchored in Pudong, containing ten rifles, 1,003 rounds of ammunition, two wooden rifles, and 132 rounds of ammunition. Because there were no passports, the quantities were inconsistent, or the licenses were expired, they suspected smuggling. The items were immediately seized and sent to the Water Police Bureau. Xia Zhimin, the acting staff member of the Bureau, who is Director Zhang Renyou's nephew, accepted a bribe of 500,000 yuan through Qin Shuming, a foreman at the 16th Pier, on behalf of the boat owner Zhou Daiqing. He arbitrarily took charge of the case, not turning it over to the First Section of the Bureau, which is in charge of such matters. The next day, he drafted an opinion, without submitting it to the Deputy Director for review, and directly sent it to his uncle Zhang Renyou, who approved the release on bail.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding Zhang Renyou Extorting Property Under False Pretexts: The Xinfushen Steamboat had a damaged winch on March 16th of this year, causing wood to fall and kill a worker, Yang Qingjia. The Water Police Bureau investigated. Zhang Renyou, using the pretext that Guo Liangzhen, the general affairs director of the steamboat company, Wang Wengao, the chief engineer, and Gao Xiaolin, the winch worker, were suspected of negligent homicide, threatened to transfer them to the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate and extorted 200 million legal tender from Wu Delin, the general manager of the steamboat company, then used his position to alter the case to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Illegally Using Official Power to Embezzle Diesel Fuel</p>
<p>(5) Regarding Zhang Renyou and Huang Boqian Embezzling Public Property: The No. 8 motorboat of the Green Water Police Bureau uses diesel fuel. It was damaged by the Customs' Kesheng vessel in early March of this year and has not yet been repaired. Huang Boqian, using his authority as the chief of the General Affairs Section, submitted monthly expense reports to the General Bureau for diesel fuel consumption for patrol boats in March and April, embezzling a total of 331 gallons in March and 383 gallons in April. Fei Dingsen, the personnel administrator, discovered this and secretly reported it to Zhang Renyou, but Zhang Renyou ignored it, shielded him, and did not report it.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding Zhang Renyou and Xie Yiyun Soliciting Property: Cao Yusheng and others were caught stealing Texaco diesel fuel on May 6th of this year by the Water Police Bureau. Xie Yiyun, a staff member of the Bureau, was assigned to handle the case. Zhang Renyou colluded with Xie, claiming they could reduce Cao Yusheng's sentence, extorting 300 million legal tender from Cao Yusheng for their own use.</p>
<p>Huang Boqian's Theft and Sale of Public Property, Seeking Profit in Matters Outside His Jurisdiction, and Embezzlement in Official Matters</p>
<p>(7) Regarding Huang Boqian's Theft and Sale of Public Property, Seeking Profit in Matters Outside His Jurisdiction, and Embezzlement in Official Matters: In April of this year, Huang Boqian stole and sold a porcelain bathtub from the personnel administrator's office of the Water Police Bureau, obtaining 12 million yuan. In March of this year, he sold two large iron anchors stored in front of the Bureau's gate due to a case, obtaining 50 million yuan. In April of the same year, he sold seven large coils of submarine cable seized by the Yangjing Police Station due to a case, obtaining 8.7 million yuan in legal tender. On May 26th of the same year, he sold over 800 catties of stolen coal, obtaining 2.5 million yuan in legal tender. He repeatedly instructed Liu Ruowei and Chen Daikang, patrol officers of the Dongjiadu Police Station, to order local lumber yards to donate lumber, valued at approximately 200 million yuan in legal tender; ordered patrol officers of the Yangjing Police Station to solicit fresh fish from the people; and ordered Wen Zaoshi, a patrol officer of the inspection team, and police officer Fan Jianfu to solicit cigarettes to seek illegal profits.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Princess at Sun Moon Lake: The Scenery of Taiwan's Indigenous People</h3>
<p>— Xu Maochun</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese movement of Taiwan's Indigenous people wrote a glorious and tragic epic. Events such as the Qijiaochuan and Bawangjie incidents caused headaches for the Japanese. In particular, the Wushe incident of 1930, due to unbearable Japanese humiliation, resulted in the killing of 134 Japanese police and civilians. At the time, the Japanese used cannons and airplanes to carry out atrocities, but still failed to conquer Wushe. Finally, they used poison gas. Seeing that they could not resist, most of the people committed suicide in caves. The Japanese finally won, but this shocked the world, and countries that uphold humanitarianism and justice rose up to condemn them.</p>
<p>During the period of Japanese rule, the activities of the Indigenous people were extremely restricted, and they were called "raw savages," "civilized savages," or "local savages." The Indigenous people were severely discriminated against. This was a mistake. Since Taiwan's recovery, the Three Principles of the People have been used as the guiding policy—all ethnic groups within the country are equal. Therefore, the name "savage" has now been changed to "Indigenous people of the mountains" to correct people's perceptions.</p>
<p>I have been in Taiwan for three months. Wanting to understand the situation of the Indigenous compatriots, and driven by curiosity, I stole a moment of leisure from my busy schedule and went alone from Kaohsiung to Sun Moon Lake to visit these Indigenous compatriots who are of concern to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Sun Moon Lake is located 29 kilometers east of Taichung City, north of Yushan, at an altitude of 726 meters. It forms a unique world. The lake is a sheet of emerald green, with endless ripples, like a large mirror, with the mountain shadows reflected in the heart of the lake, like a painting. Especially the morning mist and evening glow, the atmosphere is ever-changing, fleeting, and infinitely varied. It is truly worthy of being called the best scenery in Taiwan. This beautiful and fascinating scenery allows millions of travelers to immerse themselves and linger, forgetting to return—how elegant and enviable is this homeland of the Indigenous compatriots!</p>
<p>The place where the Indigenous people live is called "Buji," on the eastern shore of Sun Moon Lake. After crossing the lake from Hanbi Building, I found a sign full of phonetic symbols under a coconut tree on the edge of the village of Buji, which read:</p>
<p>The Shao people of the mountains, 270 years ago, their ancestors discovered Sun Moon Lake while chasing white deer near Luanda Mountain and Batongguan. They then moved from Zhuma Village in Alishan to Shiren Village (located about three miles west of Buji on the edge of Sun Moon Lake). When the power project was completed, Shiren Village was submerged in water (Sun Moon Lake is the largest power reservoir in Taiwan), and they moved to Buji (local name Maolao Bao). Because of the convenient transportation, it was developed earlier. During the Japanese occupation, it was regarded as a "civilized savage," so it was called "Civilized Savage Village." In the past, the chief was the leader of a tribe. The village leader has been changed ten times. The current village chief, Mao Xinxiao, is the former chief of the tribe. The village currently belongs to Yuchi Township in Yushan District, Taichung County. The whole village has 41 households, with a population of 92 males and 87 females, totaling 179 people. There are 55 children in school. There are twelve surnames: Mao, Shi, Chen, Xie, Yuan, Huang, Gao, Liu, Zhang, Bi, Qiu, Zhu, etc. The community farms, fishes, and gathers firewood, which is self-sufficient. Every year from the first to the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, there is a grand dance party. Since the restoration of Taiwan, a Mandarin training class has been established in the village, divided into adult and children's classes, actively promoting Mandarin...</p>
<p>After reading this sign, I had a general understanding of the Indigenous people of Buji. I thought this was the time of their grand dance party, and I was feeling pleased with myself when I suddenly heard a melodious song. I discovered dozens of Indigenous people singing and dancing in a graceful manner. I hurried forward to watch. I saw them holding hands, using a large stone as the center, circling around in a large circle, singing and dancing, moving step by step to the right, with orderly rhythm. The singing echoed with the lake water, the lingering sound moving, and very enjoyable.</p>
<p>When this dance stopped, another song began. Several women each held a pestle and surrounded a hard stone with a diameter of about one meter, simultaneously raising the pestles, singing and pounding at the same time, with neat beats. It is said that this is the famous pestle song, also known as stone sound, using the sound of the pestle hitting the stone to coordinate the singing, which is also clear and melodious.</p>
<p>The Indigenous people have many songs. According to them, the song they sang the most times and the most easily that day, which I recorded and translated into Mandarin with Mr. Ye Yugang (from Shouning, Fujian), the Taiwanese Mandarin Promotion Committee official stationed in the village and the host of the Sun Moon Lake Mandarin Training Class, is a song called "不怕浪來不怕風" (Not Afraid of Waves, Not Afraid of Wind), which is appended below to share with readers:</p>
<p>(Not Afraid of Waves, Not Afraid of Wind)</p>
<p>Not afraid of waves, not afraid of wind</p>
<p>We shake our fishing boats and head into the lake</p>
<p>Brother casts the net</p>
<p>Sister shakes the oar</p>
<p>For the sake of life, we don't care where the fishing boat goes</p>
<p>A family's fishing boat goes wherever</p>
<p>No moon, no stars</p>
<p>We light our fishing lights and head into the lake</p>
<p>Dad casts the net</p>
<p>Mom shakes the oar</p>
<p>For the sake of life, we don't care if there is no moon or stars</p>
<p>A family's fishing boat goes wherever</p>
<p>In the mist, the rain is drizzling</p>
<p>Shaking the fishing boat into the lake</p>
<p>Letting it drift with the waves</p>
<p>Not afraid of the tight wind and rain</p>
<p>Not afraid of the high waves</p>
<p>For the sake of life, we don't care about the fierce rain and wind</p>
<p>A family's fishing boat goes wherever</p>
<p>I visited Chief Mao Xinxiao, but the Chief was not at home. The eldest and second princesses received me. They were dressed very neatly, wearing Indigenous clothing of medium quality fabric, wearing colored glass bands on their heads, and inserting feathers. Their postures and facial features were very upright. Especially the second princess, who was eighteen years old, slender and graceful, was already moving enough. Added to that her very modern and beautiful cloud-like hair, and the evenly applied rouge and lipstick, her radiant appearance was even more charming. However, the only shortcoming was that although the upper half of her body was very exquisite, her feet were habitually bare, without shoes.</p>
<p>"Where did your father go?" I began to ask them in a very gentle tone.</p>
<p>"Dad went up the mountain," they both answered in fluent Mandarin, which surprised me so much that I stared wide-eyed.</p>
<p>"What are your names?"</p>
<p>"Mao Yujuan," the eldest princess said first. "Mao Axiu," the second princess followed.</p>
<p>"Who is in your family?"</p>
<p>"Dad, Mom, sister, and me," the second princess said quickly.</p>
<p>"No brothers?" I continued to ask.</p>
<p>"No," the second princess's tone was particularly charming.</p>
<p>"What are your husbands' names?" With the purpose of gathering material, I rudely asked them.</p>
<p>"Called Mao Ashou," the eldest princess said shyly. "My sister is not yet betrothed."</p>
<p>"Why does your husband also have the surname Mao?" I felt very strange.</p>
<p>"Matrilineal Marriage." The eldest princess hesitated for a moment, but the second princess was more quick-witted. "Outsiders call my sister Elizabeth, and call my sister's husband what, Edinburgh, or what, Mountbatten. They also call me what, Margaret!" She said intermittently, but I was even more surprised by her knowledge.</p>
<p>"What does the husband do? Is he not in the navy?" I said jokingly.</p>
<p>"He recently went to Shanghai to buy cloth," the eldest princess replied casually.</p>
<p>"Don't you feel lonely when he goes to Shanghai?" I asked the eldest princess with a smile. The eldest princess seemed not to have understood what I meant, and just sighed and stood up lazily. I discovered that her belly was already large. I thought to myself that her delivery period was probably around the same time as Elizabeth's.</p>
<p>"Who will you marry?" I asked the second princess half seriously and half jokingly.</p>
<p>"Marry your husband!" The eldest princess said loudly with a mischievous smile, pointing at me. "Chinese," the second princess also said naturally at the same time, causing a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Finally, with their consent, I signed my name and took a photo as a souvenir. I took three photos with them in a row, and also asked them to teach me how to dance. I gave them 1,000 NT dollars in total (by convention, outsiders pay 200 NT dollars per person per photo with them, Sun Moon Lake has many tourists, according to statistics this income is considerable). I said goodbye to them amidst their continuous "Thank you!" "Goodbye!"</p>
<p>I inspected other parts of the village again. It was lunchtime, and the sound of drinking and guessing was everywhere. They used large bowls to hold wine, and two people drank from the same bowl in a very generous and pleasant manner. It is said that they are extremely fond of smoking and drinking, and almost every meal is inseparable from it, regardless of gender or age.</p>
<p>After walking a few dozen steps further, I discovered another miracle: a young man of about 22 or 23 years old was carrying a chair on his back, and a richly dressed young woman was sitting on the chair, followed by a large group of people, with gongs and drums, and continuous firecrackers. "What is this doing?" I asked myself in confusion, "This is a wedding!" A young man standing in front of me told me in very broken Mandarin, "The one sitting in the chair is the bride, and the one carrying the chair is the groom. They met while singing on the mountaintop and made a vow. On an auspicious day, the groom carries the chair to the bride's house to personally bring the bride back. However, this method is no longer used much. The new wedding method is to carry her in a sedan chair." I suddenly understood. Wouldn't men with slightly weaker physical strength be unqualified to marry with such a wedding method?</p>
<p>Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland. The Indigenous people are a branch of our Chinese nation. They have made great progress, and they have kept up with the times. We must never discriminate against them as savages. We should cooperate sincerely, unite as one, let us hold hands of sincerity, and march in step toward the path of national rejuvenation! I have deep impressions from visiting the Indigenous people, and I hope that the Chinese people have this new understanding of the Indigenous people.</p>

<h3>The Iron Oxen Beside the Yellow River Bridge in Lanzhou Will Be Recast into Water Pipes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Lanzhou, 29th] Lanzhou's tap water project is in dire need of water pipes, so it has been considered to use the scrap iron oxen beside the Yellow River Bridge to recast them into water pipes. After the Municipal Council approved this, excavation is imminent. It is said that there are two iron oxen on each of the north and south banks of the Yellow River. These were used to tow floating bridges before the iron bridge was built. Each ox weighs over 4,000 catties. During the War of Resistance, the police department had planned to auction these items to build the site of the 6th Branch Bureau, but they were unable to dig them out, so they have stood until now. Because the section buried in the soil is three-fifths longer than the exposed section, to excavate these heavy iron oxen, at least five cranes are needed.</p>
<h3>Six Sick Military Officers Gang-Rape Regimental Commander's Wife</h3>
<p>Strange Drama at Wuhan Army Hospital</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Hankou, 22nd] A rape case recently occurred at the Wuhan Army Hospital. The wife of a certain regimental commander was in the hospital caring for her husband. Six sick military officers in the same hospital intercepted her and gang-raped her in a room. After the victim complained to the relevant authorities, the six military officers have been sent to the military court of the supply area for trial.</p>
<h3>The Great Bandit of Dinghai, Wang Rongxuan, Executed by Shooting in Yin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Yin County, 22nd] Wang Rongxuan, the great bandit of Dinghai, was captured by Magistrate Yao and, after approval from the higher authorities, was sentenced to death. Yesterday morning, he was escorted by the Zhoushan Bandit Suppression Command to Baituhu Mountain outside the West Gate of this county for execution by shooting. One bullet was enough to end his life. It is said that the bandit Wang was 27 years old, from Baoding, Hebei, and was the leader of the East China Guerrilla Brigade, a bandit organization in Eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Families of Conscripted Men in Yangzhong Attack and Beat the District Office of Li Dian Town</h3>
<p>Several District Heads and Police Officers Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Jiangdu, 22nd] This county's quota of 1,293 soldiers has been fully drawn and conscription has begun. However, on the morning of the 21st, the families of conscripted men in the Third District gathered about a thousand women and children, attacking and beating the District Office of Li Dian Town. Several district heads and police officers were beaten and injured. Fortunately, the security team handled the situation properly, preventing a tragedy. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Wang specifically requested that the councilors go to the countryside to persuade them and investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Kunshan District Procuratorate Will Investigate the Case of Songjiang County Magistrate Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>A Sensational Love Tragedy in Taishan: Sisters in Love with the Same Man Willing to Share Him as Husband, Mother Disapproves, Both Commit Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Guangzhou, 22nd] A sensational love tragedy recently occurred near Foshan. A woman named Zeng Liu, whose husband runs a business in Hong Kong, has two daughters, the eldest named Jianping, 19 years old, and the younger named Huilan, 17 years old. Both are students in secondary school. The sisters successively fell in love with a male classmate named Huang Yixiong and were willing to share him as a husband. Unexpectedly, their mother discovered this and immediately ordered them to drop out of school and forbade them from interacting with Huang. The sisters then committed suicide by poison on the 20th, and jointly signed a suicide note to their mother and their lover, the words were sad and touching.</p>
<h3>Autumn Scenery Along the Long Right (Gansu) "Clouds Obscure the Mid-Autumn Moon, Granaries Burst Open" Farmers Yearn for a Bountiful Harvest</h3>
<p>[Report from our Lanzhou correspondent on the 18th] Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival. Early in the morning, citizens scrambled to buy meat for the holiday. In the blink of an eye, the meat stalls were empty, naturally due to butchers engaged in "cold war" with the municipal government. In some places, there was even a rush to buy meat. An unconfirmed report stated that in one meat market scramble, a civil servant's index finger was mistaken for a pig's trotter by a butcher and severed in two. While this is likely an exaggeration, it is indicative of the situation in the market.</p>
<p>This year, festive gift packages have indeed disappeared from the market, and gift certificates have been ordered to be discontinued. "Frugality" seems to be widespread. Only the small mooncakes, following the price limits, have become noticeably thinner and conveniently smaller.</p>
<p>Many shops closed in the morning, and by afternoon, almost every store was shuttered, resembling the atmosphere of the abolished Lunar New Year. In the evening, floating clouds obscured the moon, much to the chagrin of men of letters and poets. However, the farmers squinted and smiled, recalling the saying, "Clouds obscure the Mid-Autumn Moon, granaries burst open," and looked forward to a bumper harvest next year.</p>
<p>Another year passes swiftly with the autumn wind! It is rumored that local authorities have also agreed on price limits for cotton, wool, fur, and other goods, awaiting publication. The "price manual," which has been the subject of much discussion for a week, has yet to be released. The Municipal Government's Economic Inspection Team recently conducted surprise inspections of warehouses and arrested "gold tigers," uncovering that several gold shops, including Deshunxing, were suspected of illegally trading gold and silver and engaging in private lending. Several trading firms, including Fujugong, were suspected of hoarding goods and dealing in hard currency. All were transferred to the Lanzhou Special Criminal Court for legal proceedings today. The seized goods are limited to being sold at the fixed prices within the city and are not allowed to be exported. At the same time, measures to strengthen the control of materials have also been announced. From now on, incoming goods must be registered, and no goods are allowed to be exported without approval. In this case, will the underground materials automatically emerge? People are hoping the government will conduct one or two general surveys.</p>
<p>Amid the nationwide price controls, the road maintenance fees of the Ministry of Transportation's 7th District Highway Engineering Bureau, as if having reached a tacit agreement, suddenly announced an increase during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The increase is a staggering one hundred and eighty percent, with the new rates for road maintenance fees in the provinces of Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai being four fen and five hao per ton-kilometer, and in Gansu Province, four fen and five li. It is said that the Bureau has been losing 200 billion yuan (legal tender) per month, and without the increase, it simply cannot sustain itself!</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong Inspects the Hexi Corridor</p>
<p>General Zhang Zhizhong has been in the Northwest for more than two years, but has mainly used Dihua (Ürümqi) and Lanzhou as bases, flying back and forth. The strategic Hexi Corridor in the Northwest has not been visited even once. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, he set off with more than 30 people to inspect the Hexi Corridor, and is expected to return around the 25th or 26th. In addition to inspecting military and political facilities in the Hexi Corridor, another task for Zhang is to facilitate a major reconciliation between party and group figures.</p>
<p>After strengthening economic controls, six of the original nine credit cooperatives in Lanzhou were forcibly shut down, and three were allowed to resume operations. More than two months have passed, but none have resumed operations. The reason is that the government restricts the business scope of each credit cooperative to its members only. Each cooperative considers that it will be impossible to maintain operations after resumption, and with the market depressed and financial stagnation after the currency reform, each cooperative is wary. It seems that if the government does not amend the restrictive regulations, even these three credit cooperatives that were approved to resume operations but have not yet done so will be dissolved.</p>
<p>After the currency reform, the national banks stopped all lending. Public and private enterprises in the city felt that the turnover of funds was sluggish. Public enterprises, because the prices of their products were frozen, while the salaries and allowances of their employees suddenly doubled, have begun to adopt austerity policies. The result, of course, is layoffs. All eyes are on the opening of loans, but according to Yang Jiqing, manager of the Central Bank, the board of directors of the Joint Four Banks is still studying the matter.

<h3>The Shanghai Area Resumes Selling National Treasury Bonds Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent] We have learned from the Central Bank that the Ministry of Finance's short-term treasury bonds will resume sale in the Shanghai area starting today (the 23rd). The bonds are available in five denominations: 50 gold yuan, 100 gold yuan, 500 gold yuan, 1,000 gold yuan, and 5,000 gold yuan. They mature in one month and are issued at a discount, with interest added separately at a monthly rate of 1.5 percent. The discount changes daily, and today's quoted price is 98.5. There are three locations for sale: the Business Bureau of the Central Bank at 15 Bund, the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank at 24 Bund, and the Hongkou Revenue and Expenditure Office of the National Treasury Bureau on North Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Selling Prices Mostly Reach the Limit; Rice Is Consistently Strong; Fufeng and Other Seven Factories Began Distributing Flour Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rice market price limits have stabilized. Due to the continued scarcity of arrivals, few samples are available on the market. Although sales are sluggish, due to even scarcer supply, the market remains firm and transactions are quite slow. The market closed very early. In the southern market, all japonica rice has reached the limit price, except for high-milled indica rice. In the northern market, all rice is also open at the limit price. Transactions in the market are mostly for medium-quality goods, with few high-quality goods available and little trading. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 2,023 shi in the north and south markets combined.</p>
<p>Flour supply is scarce, transactions are slow, and the market continues to be firm. Lao Che, Bingship, Hong Lan, Jiancheng, etc., are not opening due to no supply. Only Jinlong Flour and Maigen Flour, which have lower quality, are opening at the limit price. Hero Flour is less desirable, opening at 6.885 yuan. Furthermore, Fufeng, Fuxin, and other seven major manufacturers jointly allocated flour of various brands to retailers. It is estimated that over 300 registered retailers were allocated over 7,000 packages, each receiving approximately 25 packages. Bran is opening at the limit price.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains are firm, with not many transactions. The appetite for yellow soybeans in foreign-style shops has decreased. Oil factories are purchasing them. Car beans and Zha beans are each at the limit price. New yellow soybeans are selling well on this street, and the market is quite profitable. More corn is being purchased by the northern gangs, and the price has increased by 10-20 jiao. Red sorghum is active in the countryside and has also increased by 10-20 jiao. Broad beans, naked barley, and mung beans are all average. Sesame is still at the previous day's price, and blanched peanuts have some transactions at a slightly higher price.</p>
<p>Edible Oil continues to rise, as people's hearts remain firm due to the rise in all grains. Soybean oil has significant fluctuations. It initially opened at 50.05 yuan, once reaching 51.5 yuan, and closed at 50.03 yuan due to continuous outgoing orders, an increase of 8 jiao. Rapeseed oil closed at 47 yuan, an increase of 5 jiao. Pure rapeseed oil is at 59.9 yuan, one jiao away from the limit price. Hot rapeseed oil increased by 5 jiao, and small-cart sesame oil was specially lowered by 1 jiao. Soybean cake is still trading at 4.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender Public Bonds Must Be Redeemed Within the Deadline; Failure to Collect Will Result in Forfeiture</h3>
<p>According to Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, who came to Shanghai to see off Minister of Finance Wang on behalf of the Ministry of Finance: (1) The government has promulgated the method of advancing the settlement of legal tender public bonds by tiered doubling, and this department shall comply with it. The principal and interest of the actually sold amounts of various public bonds that should be settled in advance are estimated to be 6 billion yuan in legal tender. The gold yuan base required for settlement has been allocated to the managed banks by the National Bank of China. The unexpired bond number books and instructions on the settlement procedure have also been compiled and are being sent to the managed banks by the Ministry of Finance via the National Bank of China for selection. This settlement period will begin on October 1st in all parts of the country and will last for six months. Bond tickets that are not applied for settlement after the deadline will be invalidated. (2) The principal and interest of the U.S. dollar public bonds of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), which will mature at the end of this month, will still be handled in accordance with the original regulations. The U.S. dollar funds required have been communicated by the Ministry of Finance to the National Bank of China, which has allocated them in full to the Fund Management Committee for payment. (3) The government has promulgated the method of exchanging foreign currency bonds for reorganized public bonds. The Gold Lan 公債 Statute proposal has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Registration and exchange procedures will be carried out once the regulations are promulgated.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Director Chen Bingzhang returned to Nanjing by train last night.</p>
<h3>Money Supply Is Increasingly Loose; Banks Are Significantly in Deficit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the looseness of the money supply in the city became even more apparent. The Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury were significantly in deficit in the exchange of bills and notes among the silver and money industries, totaling 2.77 million yuan. Among them, the Central Bank was in deficit by 1.41 million, the Bank of China was in deficit by 1.34 million, the Bank of Communications was in surplus by 320,000, the Farmers Bank was in deficit by 490,000, the China Trust Bureau was in surplus by 180,000, the Postal Savings Bureau was in deficit by 30,000, and the Central Cooperative Treasury was balanced. Commercial banks were in surplus by 430,000 in large transactions and 190,000 in small transactions. Foreign banks were in surplus by 430,000 in total.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Purchase of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>The total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency purchased by the National Bank of China and its entrusted agency banks on the 21st is as follows:</p>
<p>Gold: 29834.163 taels, silver: 28238.98 taels, silver dollars: 125781.50 coins, silver dimes: 115356 jiao (double hao), U.S. dollars: 57301.80 yuan, Hong Kong dollars: 233041.1 yuan, totaling 8789126.56 yuan in gold yuan.</p>
<p>The Central Bank has temporarily suspended the purchase of pounds sterling and rupees because the British government has banned their import. In order to protect the rights and interests of the people, the Central Bank is negotiating with the British government. Holders can entrust them to the Central Bank for safekeeping before the end of this month. In addition, the Philippine peso, which was previously suspended for exchange, has now been resumed by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Limited Transactions of Foreign-Style Tea</h3>
<p>In the foreign-style tea market, which has been stagnant for many days, exporters were still enthusiastically inquiring yesterday. However, due to the scarcity and high prices in the production areas, the owners continued to be reluctant to part with their goods easily, resulting in a calm process and only sporadic transactions. The trend can be considered stable.</p>
<p>It is understood that North Africa is very concerned about Fu tea and is still sending telegrams to tea merchants here to inquire about prices. However, the production cost of our country's tea has gradually increased, which will be higher than the price of tea abroad. In this situation, it will be increasingly difficult to cooperate with exports, and the future may not be optimistic. As for domestic sales tea, supply and demand are still there, and there is no significant change.</p>
<h3>Sugar Is in a Slump</h3>
<p>Since the ban on the export of sugar, foreign sales have been suspended. The amount cleared on this street is also limited, so the market is in a slump. Yesterday's transactions were rare, and the trend was particularly flat. The price of 20th-term Taiwan Red Warehouse receipts opened at 24.57 yuan in the morning and closed at 24.70 yuan in the afternoon. (No spot goods were seen on the market.) Bagged and leather-packed half-sugar closed at 29 yuan and 28.9 jiao respectively, a decrease of 10-20 jiao compared with the previous day. Coarse sand was slightly more beautiful by one jiao, at 27.2 yuan. Native fine white sugar rose by 2 jiao, while other grades remained at the previous day's price.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Export Exchange Settlement Last Week Nearly US$5 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent] The amount of export goods from Shanghai that applied for exchange settlement this week (September 12 to September 18) increased compared with last week. The total figure is equivalent to US$4,986,097.62. This includes US$1,899,483.38 for export goods for which the government settles the exchange itself (i.e., gauze, ore, sugar, etc.). Divided by commodity type: (Unit: US dollars) Hog bristles: $668,498.19, Tung oil: $556,126.37, Furs: $87,247.60, Blue oil: $176,437.54, Tea: $43,798.99, Straw hats: $123,857.56, Embroidered clothing: $31,805.26, Feathers: $69,455.52, Metals and their products: $71,952.52, Wool yarn and raw silk: $11,442.49, Eggs: $129,015.99, Cotton fabrics: $218,233.61, Wool and wool fabrics: $73,497.56, Silk fabrics: $168,300.82, Vegetables and their products: $21,089.70, Sundries: $635,854.52, Cloth: $731,795.07, Cotton yarn: $1,141,786.36, Ore: $18,739.10, Sugar: $7,162.85.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Are Stable, Transactions Are Rare</h3>
<p>Raw silk prices are stable, and transactions are rare. Both wholesale and retail traders are holding a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is in a state of depression. Artificial silk from Italian sources is plentiful, and all parties are saturated. The 82nd term of the Silk Weaving Guild's allocation of goods from the China Trust Bureau has been received, and distribution to various silk factories began yesterday. The 83rd term has been submitted for approval. There are few Japanese goods on the market, and there are no transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the domestic autumn sales have begun, and retail sales in stores are even more prosperous. Wholesale firms have sold a little, but not much. Shanghai accounts for half of the 500,000 rolls allocated by the Silk Weaving Guild. Once consultations with the Silk Fabric Association are completed, distribution will be carried out extensively. However, the demand for spot goods in the market is still high, but inventories are thin, and there are even fewer transactions.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Allocation Price Determined</h3>
<p>The price of artificial silk for this week's allocation has been decided by the China Trust Bureau as follows: (1) 120 Bright: 1,033.3 yuan per case, (2) 120 Dull: 1,126.3 yuan, (3) 120 Bright: 878.3 yuan, (4) 75 Bright: 1,188.3 yuan, (5) 75 Dull: 1,271 yuan, (6) 100 Bright: 1,074.6 yuan, (7) 150 Bright: 921.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Is Mediocre; Cloth Sources Are Not Scarce, Trend Is Declining</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was firm first and then soft yesterday. People's sentiments were calm, and the market atmosphere was also soft. Yesterday, customers on this street were not very interested, and fine yarn was slightly soft. For 20-count coarse yarn, supply and demand were equal, and the price did not change. For 16-count and below, Shenxin opened for distribution with many varieties, people's hearts turned tired, and prices were weak.</p>
<p>The cloth market trend was declining yesterday. Amidst the increase in capital of the firms, the owners slightly sold off their goods, and the market trend was initially very firm. Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi yuan pique both opened at 28.5 yuan. After the addition of the allocation of cotton cloth by the dyeing guild to retail cloth shops, customers were satiated. Customers held a wait-and-see attitude because the large-scale export ban was still suspended. Mid-way, the supply was not scarce, and high prices were difficult to support. Transactions were sparse at closing, and most reported declines.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth closed at 27.8 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 5 jiao compared with the previous day. Wufu fine cloth traded at 25.5 yuan, a decrease of 4 jiao. Longtou B fine cloth slightly decreased by 1 jiao, Laba brand children's fine cloth was flat, and pique was in demand and the price was slightly rising. Sijunzi yuan pique rose to 28.4 yuan, approaching the涨 limit. Sijunzi yuan was bought directly at 29.7 yuan. The total transaction volume for the city was 1,260 bolts. In the afternoon, cotton cloth delivered by the Machinery Dyeing Guild was allocated as usual. The third batch included 830 bolts of flannel, 563 bolts of bed sheet cloth, 1,270 bolts of women's fancy woolen fabric, and 928 bolts of poplin.</p>
<p>[Report from our correspondent] According to the reports from the member factories of the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai areas, the total amount of yarn and cloth sold by the factories themselves was 486 bales of cotton yarn (equivalent to 20-count yarn) and 12,985 bolts of cotton cloth.</p>
<h3>The Export Control Commission Is Trying to Coordinate Packaging Materials for Cement Plants</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent] According to the Export Control Commission, since the victory, our country's cement production has increased significantly. Many orders have come from abroad, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea. However, the lack of materials needed to package the cement has affected the export quantity. To comply with Premier Weng's policy of promoting the export of cement and other products and maintaining the production of our country's cement industry, and to help cement plants obtain paper bags for packaging cement, the Export Control Commission has held several consultations with relevant parties and decided on the following measures, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval:</p>
<p>(1) Huaxin, Qixin, China, Shanghai, Jiangnan, North China, and Shunchang cement plants requested to purchase approximately 1.5 million paper bags from abroad for US$165,000 to meet urgent needs. The Export Control Commission submitted to the Executive Yuan for temporary transfer of the US$165,000 quota allocated to the above-mentioned factories in the fourth quarter for麻袋麻 sack. This will pay for the paper bags for the above-mentioned purpose. The foreign exchange for the import will be settled in accordance with the current trade regulations.</p>
<p>(2) Each factory must strive to export cement. As soon as a sales contract is signed with a foreign merchant, a letter of credit can be issued by the bank to import paper bags. The import of each batch of paper bags must be compared with the value of the exported cement. The maximum total value of imported paper bags shall not exceed US$1 million.</p>
<p>(3) After each cement factory has exported US$1 million worth of cement, it can apply to import paper bags and the equipment it needs in accordance with the packaging material import method.</p>
<p>Mr. Loebiass, the current chairman and founder of China Canada Co., Ltd., and Mr. Umesday, the American representative of the company, provided much assistance in the discussion of the above-mentioned measures. They are willing to advance funds for the import of these paper bags before each factory has exported cement, in order to express their belief in and sincerity in assisting China.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics are tight due to the autumn sales season, and retail and cutting businesses are extremely prosperous. Several high-end imported goods are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Many domestic goods from domestic users have been released, and manufacturers have also opened for sale. Dashi face flannels, etc., must be slightly marked up above the limit price to be purchased.</p>
<p>The people's goods in the paper circle are allocated to various wax merchants according to the limit price. The amount allocated is still determined by the amount of regular dealings. American goods in the paper circle are difficult to buy even at the limit price due to the depletion of market inventory. The monthly quota for Minfeng paper is 800 boxes, which is allocated according to the output of each factory.</p>
<p>The Silk Weaving Industry Association plans to allocate 500,000 yards of silk fabrics. Samples from each factory have been collected. The Silk Industry Association has been informed to prepare for the allocation to begin within the next week.</p>
<p>High-end goods of radios and important parts have disappeared from the market in the city. The products of the four major companies are being snapped up. Many holders of goods are hiding them and not selling them. Inferior goods are being sold on the market.</p>

<h3>Guo Youyi Will Recommend Allowing Japan to Join UNESCO</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Dr. Guo Youyi stated after a ten-day inspection here that he will recommend allowing Japan to join certain departments of UNESCO. Before leaving here for Paris via the United States, Guo stated that UNESCO already has a good informal start in Japan, and Japan is genuinely enthusiastic about the ideals of UNESCO.

He also stated that at the UNESCO conference to be held in Beirut, Lebanon, from November 15th to 20th, he will discuss with UNESCO Director-General Julian Huxley to make a formal decision regarding Japan. Guo put forward a five-point plan, including the expansion of UNESCO to Japan. He suggested that this situation be similar to Germany, namely, establishing a permanent liaison officer in Tokyo. These five points include realizing worldwide exchange of publications and teachers, revising school textbooks, and allowing Japanese representatives to participate in UNESCO conferences.</p>

<h3>Looking at National Culture from Sculptural Art</h3>
<p>— Liu Huarui</p>
<p>Since the promotion and development of archeology in China, artifacts from the Yangshao period (Late Neolithic Period of Yang Shao) have provided us with clues to trace ancient culture. The pottery and oracle bones unearthed from the Yin Ruins in Henan have been particularly helpful in proving whether Chinese civilization has close ties with Central Asia. (e.g., theories such as Faraguher's "Western Origin of Chinese Culture" and Ball's "Sumerian Culture" and "Chinese Culture"). The gradual excavation of bronzes has further demonstrated the development of Chu culture (the eighth century era in the Hubei and Hunan regions). Even the records of Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, and Dayu may prove to be more than just myths. The plants, trees, birds, and animals in the *Erya* and *Classic of Mountains and Seas* have also provided many materials for the history of botany and zoology (see My. Sowerby's works for the Asian Cultural Association).</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office recently held a Chinese sculpture exhibition, displaying many exhibits related to ancient literature, which are worthy of research and reference. All the pottery, bronzes, stone carvings, and wood carvings are particularly helpful in allowing us to understand that ancient Chinese civilization was not corrupt, backward, but magnificent and great. Even the single category of sculpture can rival Greek culture. It is modern Chinese art that is empty and withered, without having established itself.</p>
<p>The daily clothes and ornaments, such as the "coronet," "hat," and "tassel" recorded in the *Book of Rites* and the *Zhou Rituals*, as well as musical instruments and architecture, are very beautiful and independent, and can be further understood in the exhibits. For example, the color of the Tang Sancai "Plate" from Ding Huikang's collection is bright and strong, reflecting the prosperity of the Tang Dynasty. The rubbings of the stone carvings "Flying Immortal" and "Flying Tiger" unearthed in the Shapingba area of Chongqing from Chen Yishi's collection can be used to examine that Song Dynasty art was indeed not inferior to modern European and American patterns. In particular, the ancient bronze *yi* vessels such as the Chu "Mirror" and Zhou "Dun" (from the collections of Jiang Xuanyi and Ye Shuchong) are very helpful for reference to primitive history. Indeed, the *dunhou* (honest and generous) civilization produced by the *dunhou* Chinese nation is a symbol whose value shines brightly for thousands of years, with little sign of decline. What a miracle! In addition, the Wei pottery from Ruizhai's collection and Zheng Zhenduo's collection, and the stone carvings and wood carvings from Liu Haisu's collection, can all inspire us to reflect on Chinese culture.</p>
<p>If our academic circles can conduct comparative research based on the treasures unearthed in various eras and develop new artistic materials for our nation, then we can change the habit of fantasizing and splitting hairs in books over the past 20 years, and of mystifying or doubting the past, portraying Chinese national culture as mysterious or worthless. All this is enough to destroy the academic value of national culture without leaving anything behind, and there will be no way to establish a new national consciousness for the future. This is what the academic circles of our country should deeply consider and reflect on in the future.</p>

Tao and Wang made another effort and won two more games, finally winning the first set 7-5. In the second set, Tao and Wang were leading 4-2 when the heavy rain continued, and the match was interrupted. The match was finally declared suspended and rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis League</h3>
<p>Jingwu Blue Fights Against Double Heroes</p>
<p>Three sessions of table tennis league matches, three additional matches will be held today (23rd). Two matches in Group A will be held in the Jingwu Association’s gymnasium, with Jingwu Blue alternately fighting against Jingwu Red and the strong Huamei team. Jingwu Blue is the second team of Jingwu forces, and it has been showing great sharpness in this session, defeating strong teams such as Lianxing and Huanan, with the prospect of directly attacking the core area. However, in last week's match against Lianxing A, the chopper player Shui Hangao made a mistake, which led to the team's first defeat. The morale of the entire team was frustrated. Today, it will quickly fight against the double heroes who seem to be dragons and tigers, completing the final two courses. Unless an upset occurs, Jingwu Blue will be difficult to win. At that time, the team members will have to rely on strength and spirit to obtain excellent performance.</p>
<p>[Today’s Schedule]</p>

The main player Wang Chuan, Zhu Chang, fought alone in three battles. Without any major flaws, the Youth Team defeated the Green Camp 6-3. The hope of winning the championship is one step higher.</p>

<h3>A Rickshaw Ride</h3>
<p>— Mengqiu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, I went to a Japanese restaurant in Hongkou for a Japanese hot pot at a friend's invitation. After eating and sweating all over, my friend was still in high spirits and insisted on treating me to a movie at the Guanglu Theater. The Guanglu Theater is at the end of the Museum Road, which is now called Huqiu Road, as everyone must know.</p>
<p>After the movie ended, it was almost eleven o'clock, and it was drizzling. I happily thanked my friend and wanted to hail a rickshaw home.</p>
<p>The rickshaw driver asked, "Where to?"</p>
<p>"The intersection of Baker Road and McBain Road," I said.</p>
<p>Baker Road and McBain Road, even I found it tongue-twisting, like saying a tongue twister. Why are these two awkward transliterations so similar and so close together? There are new road names. McBain Road is called "Xinchang Road," but if you say Xinchang Road when hailing a rickshaw, at least seven or eight out of ten rickshaw drivers won't know it. Over time, I even forgot what the new name for Baker Road is.</p>
<p>The rickshaw driver smiled, revealing a gold tooth. He said, "Seven jiao of silver coins."</p>
<p>Seven jiao? Isn't that 2.1 million in legal tender? How could he say it! I was furious and ignored him. I hailed again:</p>
<p>"Rickshaw!"</p>
<p>"Where to?" Another one came.</p>
<p>"Baker Road and McBain Road."</p>
<p>"Five jiao. It's raining, sir."</p>
<p>"Five hundred thousand!"</p>
<p>"Sir, five hundred thousand is only enough for a few pancakes! Okay, four jiao!"</p>
<p>"Five hundred thousand!"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll give you three jiao, can't go any lower."</p>
<p>I ignored him and walked south. He followed behind. I saw empty rickshaws at the intersection of Beijing Road. Just as I was about to hail one, he spoke again:</p>
<p>"Sir, two and a half jiao is fine, right? Things are expensive!"</p>
<p>"Okay, six hundred thousand, not a single extra copper coin."</p>
<p>He sighed and said:</p>
<p>"Come, come, come, seven hundred thousand, seven hundred thousand. You, sir, don't care about a hundred thousand."</p>
<p>I looked and saw that the raindrops were getting bigger. The empty rickshaws at the intersection of Beijing Road had already found customers. If I insisted, I might not be able to hail one even if I ran to the Bund and Sichuan Road in the rain. I had no choice but to say "Damn!" in my heart and crouch down to get on the rickshaw. As soon as I sat down, I felt that the upper part of my silk gown was already thoroughly wet. As the rickshaw slowly moved forward, I couldn't help but curse "Damn" again under my breath.</p>
<p>The inside of the rickshaw was naturally stuffy and hot, but the rain was getting heavier and heavier, hitting the rickshaw canopy with a sound like someone scattering a plate of beans on the floor.</p>
<p>After a long time, I saw the International Hotel. Suddenly, he turned a corner. I thought, he's probably taking a shortcut, right? The Park Road next to the International Hotel does seem a bit shorter than McBain Road.</p>
<p>However, he suddenly stopped. The rickshaw driver got out of the rickshaw and began to untie the oilcloth on the rickshaw.</p>
<p>I felt that something was wrong and said, "I'm going to the intersection of Baker Road and McBain Road, we haven't arrived yet!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, his face turned ugly, and he said fiercely, "We agreed to go to the intersection of Park Road and Baker Road, we're here!"</p>
<p>Heavy rain was pouring down.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to give in: "Okay, okay, I'll give you an extra hundred thousand, to a little bit west of the intersection of Baker Road and McBain Road, not quite to the Sino-American Hospital."</p>
<p>He didn't answer, got back on the rickshaw seat, and pedaled slowly.</p>
<p>I took out my wallet from my bag and, in the light of the street lamps shining through the oilcloth, I counted the banknotes one by one. Damn it, except for a few hundred thousand in gold standard notes, they were all brand new gold yuan notes. I had to ask him for change—I would have to stand in the heavy rain for a few more minutes. The yellow leather shoes on my feet were just bought the day before yesterday!</p>
<p>We arrived. I got off the rickshaw and gave him a gold yuan note worth one yuan.</p>
<p>He said, "One yuan, I still need to give you change—" Then he muttered softly, "What a hassle!" While counting the banknotes from the clip on his belt.</p>
<p>The rain was still falling, and a few cold raindrops landed on my fur hat, making me feel inexplicably uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He took out a dozen banknotes. I counted them, and there were only two million. I said, "There are only two million, that's two hundred thousand short, right?"</p>
<p>He got angry and said, "I don't have any smaller bills!"</p>
<p>I really couldn't take it anymore and thought about knocking on the door of the cigarette and paper store next door to exchange for smaller bills before giving it to him. Two hundred thousand was nothing, but it was really irritating...</p>
<p>But the rain was getting heavier and heavier, and there was thunder.</p>
<p>Besides, I was already at the door. I was soaking wet, and the silk gown was sticking to my body like "tofu skin" pulled out of soup.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, I turned around and took out the key to open the door.</p>
<p>Seeing that I wasn't talking, he laughed as he pedaled the rickshaw away: "Haha, what use can two hundred thousand possibly have! Okay, okay, big shot!"</p>
<p>I was furious. When I looked back, he was already far away.</p>
<h3>Imperial Market</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qing</p>
<p>Perhaps the most bizarre exchange in the entire world is the "Imperial Market" in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p>For example, if you are certain that Spain will restore its monarchy, you can buy shares of the Spanish crown prince, Don Juan, just as you would buy ordinary stock. Conversely, if you are convinced that the Swedish royal family will abdicate and declare a republic, you can "sell off" shares of the Swedish king.</p>
<p>The price of these stocks naturally fluctuates wildly. For instance, when Don Juan suddenly moved his restoration-preparation headquarters to the Spanish border some time ago, his stock immediately soared. Similarly, when King Michael of Romania, valuing love over his kingdom, abdicated and fled overseas, his stock plummeted.</p>
<p>The participants in this stock market are naturally quite diverse, and their buying and selling have very selfish motives. Their main goal is to secure certain privileges after a restoration. As for the nobles who enthusiastically run around raising funds for restoration, they hope to return to the prosperous and honorable days of yore.</p>
<p>Currently, the most "in the know" stock in this market is Don Juan. He owns a villa in Estoril, a small town on the Portuguese coast, where he receives a constant stream of distinguished guests and maintains very close ties with Madrid, the capital of Spain. His followers are in high spirits because it is a well-known fact that the United States supports Don Juan. It is said that the State Department very much hopes he can replace Franco. According to reports in "The Nation" magazine, the State Department even requested the Pope's understanding in this matter.</p>
<p>Moreover, Don Juan is currently the head of the historically famous Bourbon family. The Bourbon family has produced a remarkable number of emperors and kings. Since Odo ascended the French throne in 888 AD, this family has produced thirty-seven French emperors, seventeen Spanish kings, twenty-nine Portuguese kings, twenty-one Neapolitan kings, thirteen Hungarian kings, and four Holy Roman Emperors. None of these countries have a monarchy today, but Don Juan's associates are deeply convinced that the time for restoration is not far off.</p>
<p>Another "hot" stock in the Imperial Market is Umberto, the deposed King of Italy. After the Italian people held a referendum and voted in favor of a republic, he was forced to leave the country, but he never formally abdicated. Moreover, he is well aware that in the current unstable political situation in Italy, there are many royalists who hope for his return.</p>
<p>In addition, the deposed King Michael of Romania and his father, Carol (both of whom abdicated because they valued love over their kingdom), are also attracting attention, while the deposed King Leopold of Belgium is not being consulted by many. Zog, the deposed King of Albania, also often likes to talk about the activities of royalist underground movements in his country, but the customers of the Imperial Market show no interest in him at all.</p>
<p>Most strangely, there is even a "Count of Paris" who claims to want to return to France to become emperor. Like Don Juan, he also lives in Estoril. Before his imperial dream is realized, this gentleman is quite well-behaved, engaging in scientific farming and earning a decent income. He works diligently every day in overalls and is not very keen on discussing politics. Whenever he has free time, he plays with his children—he has as many as ten.</p>
<p>The French government does not allow him to return to the country, but in 1938 he actually snuck back once and held a press conference in the suburbs of Paris, declaring passionately: "The time is ripe for the restoration of the French Empire!" Unfortunately, his call was ignored, and he had to quietly return to Portugal to farm.</p>
<p>However, some people in the Imperial Market are paying attention to him, and occasionally someone wants to buy his stock.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Poems from the Art Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Written on the Night of August 14th</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing, gazing up and down, how deep the night, the grass and trees turn yellow, the Milky Way shifts, the heavy dew on the green sky like tears of jade, the bright moon makes the white stork also drift, a year of empty dreams of home, half a lifetime of pity for exhaustion, the old guest of Shanxi gazes bitterly east, only now the city walls are lost in red flags.</p>
<p>My bones dissolve, my heart rots as I sit and sigh, faintly thousands of spirits whisper, Mother in the underworld also gazes at the moon, stray children cannot return home after the chaos; the insects keep me company at the third watch, a million miles without clouds make my eyes spin, white hair, a coffin of paulownia wood in the fires of war, how can one bear to offer a cake to the ends of the earth!</p>
<p>Using autumn to describe my life, I regret the passing of half of it, the tall wutong trees exhale sorrow, rustling as if wielding a brush, harmonizing with the sounds of ten thousand insects below, only saying wine is worth enjoying. Marquis Yao comes from Moling, with weakened muscles but strong arms, sitting in the pavilion, the scene is strange, tea smoke condenses and disperses, when will there be clarity outside the cup, at the end of the year I stroke my belly and sigh! Rivers and lakes are inherently diverse, who will change the way things are done? Subtle words are overly prized, the ink colors are empty and dazzling, struggling bitterly with creation, more clumsy than forging gold. The killing air of the golden sky is stern, the old man's intention turns indifferent, lightly punishing the crime of poetry, banished to West Lake, the embankment is named after Bai Su, the willows on the bridge still bear the surname Duan, the cuckoo's cry is fortunately not in season, if it ends, the world will be in chaos, raising my sleeves to overturn the chessboard, blurred and ancient, the states of Chu and Han.</p>
<p>My illness relapses during Mid-Autumn Festival, I could not go to Hangzhou, so I write a letter of apology to the gentlemen on the lake the next morning.</p>
<p>White-robed boats drift on waves of wine at night, surely saying the elegance is better than in years past, the lake surface is clear and wide, heaven is stingy, autumn silkworms enter their third sleep. (I have been sick three times from summer to autumn.)</p>
<p>Floating clouds are unsettled, the moon is startled, especially rolling away the clouds until the fourth watch, I am on the rooftop with my white hair, the human world bitterly hopes for the Yellow River to be clear!</p>
<h3>Formula</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>One day, a person went to visit the great scientist Albert Einstein. He rambled on for a long time, insisting that Einstein tell him the secret to success. Einstein said politely: "Suppose we use A to represent a person's success, then the formula for success should be: A equals X plus Y plus Z. X is work, and Y is play."</p>
<p>The guest asked, "What is Z?"</p>
<p>Einstein smiled slightly and said, "Z is to talk less."</p>
<h3>Eastern Scales, Western Claws</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>The best-selling book in the world is undoubtedly the Bible, with an average of thirty million copies sold each year, eighty thousand copies sold each day, and an average of fifty-five copies sold per second.</p>
<p>The Native Americans of the Americas are often hired as machine installation workers because they have a special innate skill: they can walk on a round shaft without feeling dizzy at all.</p>
<p>Australian earthworms are ten to twelve feet long and three-quarters of an inch thick, making them the largest earthworms in the world.</p>
<h3>I Fear Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Jiao Xin</p>
<p>I fear coming to Shanghai the most, but for the sake of making a living, I continue to come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>My hometown is an old city with few of the conveniences of the twentieth century, so it is despised by the people of Shanghai; but I am deeply attached to its "simplicity."</p>
<p>In my hometown, wearing a cloth uniform and outdated leather shoes will not subject me to the scorn of others; but in Shanghai, the situation is different: when boarding the tram, the ticket seller will wave his hand and tell you to go to the third class; when buying things, the shop assistant will never give you the best goods; they are well-versed in the ways of the world and know that your wallet is empty just by looking at your shabby clothes.</p>
<p>When visiting relatives and friends, if they are not at home and you need to wait at their house, the male and female servants are always unwilling to let you into the parlor. That kind of facial expression is truly unbearable to see; even if you enter the parlor, the servants will constantly peek at you through the crack in the door, as if a criminal were being watched by detectives; they do not treat you as a guest at all, but simply regard you as a thief. In Shanghai, you cannot wear cloth clothes; if you wear cloth clothes, you are suspected of stealing things!</p>
<p>As for cigarettes, I always smoke the lower-grade ones, which is fine in my hometown, but in Shanghai, I will run into trouble. Twice, friends came to see me, and I still offered them the lower-grade cigarettes. The friend quickly took out a cigarette from his pocket and said, "The same, don't be polite!" As he spoke, he offered me one. I saw that it was an expensive imported brand, so how could it be "the same"? His "the same" was just a polite "euphemism," and in reality, he disdained to smoke the lower-grade cigarette that was despised by the so-called upper class.</p>
<p>A movement to build the country with frugality is now underway, and newspapers publish large-scale news reports every day, with great fanfare. I thought that the previous extravagant atmosphere had changed. This time I came to Shanghai again, changing my fearful mood for a joyful one. But Shanghai is still Shanghai, and my joyful mood has changed back to a fearful one!</p>
<h3>Saint sighed is not a Talented Scholar</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Recently reading Jin Shengtan's essays, I only feel that he is simply telling the truth, frankly and honestly, which may be pleasing, but not necessarily extraordinary. If it is said to be extraordinary, it is only extraordinary in disregarding the ridicule of the mediocre and not thinking about his own life and family.</p>
<p>Most people say that Saint sighed is an extraordinary person, a talented scholar, but in reality, it is only because people are too vulgar, timid as mice, and overly value their own livelihoods. Saint sighed is definitely not an extraordinary person, nor is he a talented scholar. The fact that people regard Saint sighed as an extraordinary person and a talented scholar is precisely what Saint sighed was unlucky about. The reason why he suffered an unexpected tragedy was precisely because of this.</p>
<p>When I was young, reading Saint sighed's arguments, I also thought that he had an aura of strangeness. Reading it again today, I only feel that it is easy to understand and close to human feelings, not as violent, arrogant, absurd, and bizarre as the arguments that are commonly heard and read today. This is probably because when I was young, I first read the Bible and the biographies of sages, and I thought that the human world was really like that, mistaking the ideal for the fact. Later, I realized that what the ancient sages said was about things in another world. Therefore, reading the Bible and the biographies of sages again today, the more I read them, the more I feel that what they say is strange and astonishing, not as close to reality and relevant to reason as Saint sighed's.</p>
<p>Today, if adults still think of Saint sighed as an extraordinary person and a talented scholar, that person must be a junior high school student who has not been away from the past for a long time and is still wandering in heaven, or else he is a mentally retarded person, a hypocrite, a bad egg, an evil man, an old cunning fox, a long-term thief, who deliberately proclaims that Saint sighed is an extraordinary person and a talented scholar, and their intentions are unspeakable.</p>

<h3>Economic Resources Cut Off, Impoverished Student Earnestly Seeks Employment</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a struggling student studying at a certain university in this city. My family is from outside the customs. Years ago, for the sake of a desire for knowledge, I left Beiping and came to Shanghai to take the university entrance examination. Fortunately, I was admitted. My father was originally an accountant in a factory, but the factory was dissolved last year, and he became unemployed. The livelihood of a family of five is naturally very serious. But my father still made the greatest effort to maintain my unfinished studies. Now it is the start of the school year, and the school requires tuition fees as usual. Because my economic resources are entirely dependent on my family, I had to write home. I earnestly hoped that my family would find a way to raise this money for me. After waiting for ten days, I received a letter from home. The letter paper had only a few lines written on it: "Father's strength has been exhausted. Today, I am ashamed to pass the responsibility of a father to you. Without food for a day, my hand is too weak to write more! All I feel before me is a blur...</p>
<p>Child, take care!"</p>
<p>A blanket and a cotton coat were both pawned. I finally racked my brains to find a way to pay the tuition fee, but how should I solve the problem of living expenses in the future?</p>
<p>Editor, I hope you can help me so that I can use my spare time to do some work. There are very few things that I am qualified to do, but I am very willing to be a Mandarin tutor, secretary, primary and secondary school teacher, and hospital intern. I do not expect any special treatment, only to be able to maintain the minimum standard of living. I wish you good health. Ma Jun, September 20th.</p>
