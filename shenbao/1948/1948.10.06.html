<h3>社論　栗栖事件與蘆田內閣危機</h3>
<p>日本蘆田內閣自本年三月十日以片山前內閣「老店新開」的姿態出現以來，為時已七個月。在這半年多的時間中，蘆田內閣歷經艱險，如本年度龐大預算案，西尾副相受賄案，以及工潮公務員怠工潮等，接踵而至，致內閣焦頭爛額·蘆田運甲其靈活手腕，把這一連串的風潮應付過去以後，正對「中道政治」的前途抱着重大希望之際，昭和電工大舞弊案忽然又發生了，內閣經濟安定本部長官栗栖赳夫於九月卅日被東京檢察廳拘捕、並有傳訊蘆田之說。這一椿疑獄事件，牽連很火，內閣在輿論指責下，危機四伏，反對派更乘機脅迫蘆田內閣總辭職，原來稱為三黨的聯合陣綫亦因疑獄事件呈現了分裂：原　拖延時日的特別議會，不得不宣佈於十月十一日召開。儘管民主黨和蘆田的能度，表示相當的堅强，並不懼怕反對派因栗栖事件發動的新攻勢，可是政府信譽的降落，政府與黨的分離，事實是不可避免的了，蘆田內閣的命運，已繋於旦夕之間的幾化。</p>
<p>栗栖事件是一件政治貧汚案，從日本政治上看，是一件嚴重的事態。它不僅構成栗栖個人的不名譽，並目搆成民主黨和現政權的不名譽。無論栗栖應負刑事責任的輕重如何，蘆田首相和內閣都應角相當行政責任的。本案的眞相，據十月　一日「東京新聞」載：栗栖於本年初蘆田均內閣組織時，為求打擊反對黨，為政府黨爭取大多數起見，曾化費大量金錢，這筆金錢的應用，蘆田可能負責執行，而日本銀行　裁一萬田尙登與厚生　武田儀一兩人均與本案有關，栗栖吸引這筆金錢，查明來自昭和電工會　，日野原社長業已向法院承認捐款確有其事。法院為了進行偵察和審訊，除將栗栖和他的秘書三本常彥（前任興業銀行秘書長）逮捕外，並進行搜査一萬田與武田的住宅，警局且已下令便宜拘捕。很顯然的，這件政治貪汚案是很重大的，比西尾事件要嚴重多了！西尾接受「士木建築業者公會」的「政治獻金」，數目僅馮五十萬日圓，栗栖接受「昭和電工會社」的獻金，數目更大，且有利用職權之嫌·這事件在日本現政治上，早已構成公開秘密，現旣揭露出來，成為政爭工具，非但是要把蘆田內閣拖倒，并要蘆田從鮮艷的政治花苞中褪色下來。所以說栗栖事件的發生，對於蘆田命運的影饗是很重大的。</p>
<p>日本的政黨政治，從明治維新開始以來，就沒有建立堅實的基礎，所謂代表階級利益的政黨不從羣衆中生根，偏偏生長在皇室或軍閥財閥之肩膀上，政綱政策由上而下，政治資金也由上而下，　弊是不可避免的，而且一代比一代加深了·關於去年四月總選的流弊，前有社會黨西尾受賄事件的揭發，今又有栗栖受賄事件的被檢，雖然前者巳經法院實吿無罪，後案如何宣判尙不得而知，但嚴重的事態是很難完全掩蓋這些公開秘密的。本年六月十日東京出版的「自由國民」雜誌，刋載一篇暴露日本政治內幕。座談紀錄，將各政黨的內幕，和度田內閣的秘密，揭發無遺。該雜誌批評蘆田內閣為渣子內閣」，也稱「昭和電工內閣」。所謂渣子者，是說一　不到百名議員的第三黨而取得首揆，為民主政治的不合理：所謂「昭和電工內閣」者，就是說昭和電　會社在復興金融金庫的貸款關係上，曾給民主黨以大批的「政治獻金」，昭和電工曾對民主黨說：只要能捧出蘆田來，他們可以拿出八百萬到千萬圓。外間都說昭和電工的獻金額有一億數千萬，其中五六千萬圓是為各政黨的「諒解費」。其餘五六千萬圓是從提名蘆田到蘆田組閣完成時收買議員的費用。這筆鉅大金錢是栗栖過的戶，栗栖因有這項成交，後來取得經濟安定本部部長的職位，栗栖本來出身於民主黨，他同犬養健蘆田均的淵源並不深，在日本政黨關係上的聲譽亦不隆，由於這次不名譽的因緣而攀登高位，主管戰敗日本經濟復興的大計，把　會黨「精心結構」的「五年　與計劃草案」據為己有，栗栖自然難免不跌交的。不過這次的跌交，墮手失脚太大了，無情的暴露了日本官僚政治的無能與貪鄙</p>
<p>栗栖事件構成蘆田內閣的危機，是亳無疑義的事。但蘆田內閣是否就因本客而吿崩潰？第一，要看本屆特別議會期中，蘆田如何處理「禁止公務員罷工法案」這可以測量，總對現政權的善惡。其次要看民主黨如何抵抗民主自由黨和爭取</p>
<p>會協同兩黨的團結，共赴此難。査「禁止公務員罷工法案」的修正起草是七月廿二日盟總致函蘆田　理的，蘆田內閣根據此項調示，於八月　一日發表政令，對「國家公務員法」作了事實上的修改，對公務員的罷工及任何「勞動攻勢」均予禁止·本屆特別？會的召開，　要月的是要把這項臨時緊急措　立法化合理化，如果議會不通過，麥帥是不高興的。今天日本的政黨沒人收同盟總對抗。因此蘆田可能利用本案作護身符，藉以拖延現政權的生命。盟總對「禁止公務員罷工法」相當注視，對栗栖事仕尙無任何表示，蘆田曾為此事專程拜謁盟總，從民主黨堅定表示內閣决不辭職這項聲明看來，盟總似不願擴大本案事態，所以民主黨强硬起來，至於反對黨，不消說，民主自由黨要反對政府並要求總選的，第一黨的地位已穩坐無疑：政府與黨的社會黨，這次對栗栖事件的態度很崛　　　會　左右派均主張內閣總辭職，並說一縱令下屆政權轉落於極端保守派之民主自由黨之手，亦將不顧，因蘆田內閣中發生生栗栖事件實無顏以對國人。」其明示倒閣决心，躍然紙上。社會黨對栗栖事件說這樣硬話，有報復蘆田處置西尾事件不當的作用。蘆田內閣的產生，是社會黨的支援　蘆田西尾的私相授受，解鈴還繫　鈴人，社會黨的倒閣空氣，如眞的堅定下　　蘆田的單槍匹馬，是很難站　的</p>
<p>政府　一與黨國民協同黨，也已作內閣必須總辭職的表示看情勢，蘆田內閣是孤立乏援了，除非盟總堅决的支持，或自由黨的吉田忽與蘆田轉而合作，現政權是很難渡過今天的險璄。</p>
<h3>安定我國內局勢　盼獲得更多美援　平衡預算年需五億美元　土財長在華府記者招待會中稱</h3>

<p>王財長談稱，渠希望美國將予以援助，但指出中國更願獲得物資而非現款。一中國早一日獲得物資，則中國共黨失敗愈早」。在一億二千五百萬美元之軍事援助計劃下，中國迄今僅接獲「若干運輸機」。問以中共是否接獲任何外國之援助，王氏答稱：「余幷不確悉，但確信彼等必獲得若干援助。</p>
<p>王氏答覆問題稱，中國恢復貿、易之前途正在改進，若千物物交換貿易已經成交。王氏繼稱，渠與遠東諸國其他官負正在研究「依照西歐聯盟性質組織為經濟與政治安全起見之亞洲聯盟之可能性。一但旨在獲得美國出以與援　計劃相仿之援助。渠績稱，細卽尙未決定，談判尙在探試階段</p>
<p>土氏談稱，中國政府決維持幣、制改革對於平衡預算及償付外匯之效率，幷正竭力迷到此種目的，中國人民對此反應良好，迄今結果「十分圓滿」。王雲五繼稱：「余可保證政府有改善局勢之決心」。王氏列舉所採取之措置為：第一，檢對舊稅收制度；第二，採取新措置以有效增加政府稅收；第一一一，嚴格節省政府開支，撤裁冗員等等。「當物價安定及人民信念恢復之時，情勢卽可改善」。問以渠會否閱及衆院外交委員會小組委員關於共黨在中國境內活動情形之報告，王氏答稱，渠尙未有暇研究該報吿，但該報吿提出十分精確之分析，渠十分贊同該報吿力主加强援華之建議。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日電〕王雲五財長今中華盛頓抵此，將勾留兩日然後返國。若干招待會己凖備舉行。渠定六日在美遠東工商委員會演講，並將與此間若干財政界領袖晤談，七日由舊金山乘機返國</p>

<h3>安理會表決通過　柏林問題列議程　蘇代表宣布不參加討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎五日廣播：安理會今以九對二票，通過決定討論柏林問題，通過之後，蘇聯代表維辛斯基立卽要求發言，表示蘇聯退出此項討論，烏克蘭代表表示與蘇同進退，但兩代表均直至主席宣佈改明日討論後，始行　塲。維辛斯基堅決否認蘇聯有封鎖柏林之行為，據謂此極宣傳，全屬子虛，渠並指斥英美法三國企圖破壞四強外長會議。雜氏認為柏林問題，應由四强外長會議討論，，以便　致和平解決之途徑。蘇代表示蘇聯絕對擁護聯合國，但目前聯合國應集中注意印尼·巴勒斯坦·與希臘等問題，而將柏林問題交付外長會議處理，因此一問題不在聯合國範圍之內也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕據此間消息靈通人士今最發表意見稱，任何由國際人物如聯合國秘書長成澳洲外長伊伐特等人之出而調解柏林糾紛，現時機尙未成熟·同時據接近聯合國秘書之人士蹬實賴依與伊伐特兩人，在證明此種行動有效果時，皆不願失去此一出而調處之機會。但就目前言之，事態之發展尙未有此機會之可能。據稱，根據賴依之意見，目前之會商可備未來之用以便利東西國家間達成妥協之道路，但賴依認為任何調解之發動，就目前觀之，應來自外界多數代表團，特別係英國代表團，認為祗有在局勢變成眞正足以威脅和平，始能提出此項建議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎五日電〕維辛斯基雖已於四日暗示，蘇聯將拒絕參加任何關於柏林問題之辯論，但西方代表認為此不過係蘇聯之另一種虛張聲勢，美代表團發言人稱，吾人認為彼等不致退席，蘇聯在戰後慣於恫嚇威脅，但恫嚇與威脅決不能作為政策之某礎」。</p>
<h3>國際管制原子能問題　兩集團展開舌戰　捷表示不願鈾鑛受管制</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎五日電〕聯合國政治委員會五日繼續原子能辯論，加拿大代表麥克諾頓向蘇聯挑戰，渠稱，蘇聯似乎已宣稱準備接受美國之原子能管制計劃，以為未來討論之基礎，渠要求蘇聯保證其諾言。捷代表克萊門蒂斯譴責美國計劃係代表「原子能公有」之說，渠支持蘇聯，籲請西方不要堵塞解決之道。渠述及捷克之鈾鑛，但稱其並不重要。</p>
<p>澳代表霍奇遜稱，譽美國對原子能之建樹，為「劃時代及獨特性的」，但反對暫時結東聯合國與蘇聯間商談原子能管制的加拿大建議，該項建議並已獲得三强支持。渠稱，「吾人必須不放棄任何可能達成協談的機會，因為失欺的結果，對人類的影響委實可怖。」薩爾瓦多代表攻擊蘇聯暗示可能擁有原子彈，渠以肯定之語句稱「她不會擁有原子武器。」白俄羅斯代表克齊勒夫指斥美國採用「棒喝政策」，所謂獨佔原子能卽係「最大的一根棒。」克萊門蒂斯宣稱，捷克不願將其鈾礦交國際管制，渠之聲明頗堪重視，因捷克為蘇聯勢力圈內之唯一產鈾國家。渠稱，捷克反對國際管制原子能發展，係由於「吾人有鈾礦，在該項計劃下，吾人必須放棄鈾礦而交與國際機構。」蘇聯在一九四五年後，卽控制捷克之礦產，在獨佔生產的租借協定下，禁止捷克人經營礦茱。菲代表羅慕洛稱，蘇聯之新原子能建議，倘若與吾人所認之含意無誤，則不失為一綫曙光，渠稱，世界上僅美國擁有原子彈。</p>
<h3>蘇聯境內發生「奇突」爆炸　擬係原子試驗</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓四日電〕瑞士沮利克氣象台之地震儀，表示俄國某處發生「奇怪」之爆炸，此或因作原子試驗所致，美國科學家極注意此事。聞美國數實驗室亦紀錄同樣震動，美國地震學家將於星期四舉行按期之大會，屆時將研究此震動是否為原子性，抑係用尋常大量炸藥所致。</p>
<h3>蘇聯致力原子研究</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦四日電〕莫斯科電台四日廣播塔斯社之列寗格勒訊稱，蘇聯物理學家伐符洛夫頃已完成有助於原子研究之發光性研究。伐氏在其所著新書中，指出冷光或發光體性，「已成為物理學根本部份及原子·分子·結晶體·流質等結構學說中不可分開之部份，有助於物理學家及化學家之研究物質結構，其實際用途亦己大增。」</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦四日電〕英共黨示威者四日擬搗散倫敦與克勞埃頓之武裝部隊微募大會，但為軍警驅散。在偷敦戶外大會中，有二人在國防部長亞歷山大演說時爬上講台，持有「不為美國金元作戰」之旗幟，彼等與其他十人均為警察逮捕。此間舉行大會時，雖有衝突，但未有傷害情事。</p>
<h3>西歐五國政府正式宣布　蒙帥任聯軍統帥　陸空海軍司令由英法將領分任　美加參加聯防辦法商妥</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎五日電〕聞英美法三國外長於五日下午在此間舉行兩小時之會議後，對於擴大西歐聯盟防禦計劃為大西洋聯盟，俾美國加拿大共同參加之辦法，已作重大決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦五日電〕參加白魯奉爾條約之西歐五國政府，昨晚在此間發表西歐聯軍統帥之芷式人選，恰如一般預料蒙哥馬利元帥已被任為西歐聯軍之永久統帥。</p>
<p>法國泰西尼將軍被任為西歐聯軍地面部隊總司令，英國空軍元帥勞勃被任為西歐聯軍空軍總司令，法海軍中將夏偕爾被任為西歐聯軍海軍指揮官。西歐聯軍海軍指揮官不用「總司令」之名稱，殊堪注意，蓋一般均知戰事一旦爆發，英海軍將在其本國司令官指揮下作戰也。故西歐聯軍海軍指揮官，實際上僅為西歐聯盟之顧問而已。按蒙帥現為英帝國參謀總長，渠出任新職時，將辭去現職。泰西尼將軍現為法陸軍總監，勞勃元帥現任英空軍戰鬥機隊總司令，夏諧爾將軍為法海軍副參謀長。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：蒙哥馬利元帥將辭去英帝國參謀總長職，繼任人以英國中東總司令克洛寇之呼聲為最高。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦四日電〕法海軍大將夏諧爾被任為西歐海軍總司令，英海軍各界對此頗有好評，因此職主要工作乃在調整歐洲沿海一幣之海軍防務，而法國佔海綫之大部分也。海軍界又指出夏氏將以「西歐海軍代表」為銜，且將以對陸空軍總司今指示機宜為其主要任務，豫料其參謀處中將含有高級海軍軍官。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦四日電〕白魯塞爾公約五簽字國之陸海空軍參謀總長，定明日在此間開會，由英空軍參謀總長泰特勳爵任主席。</p>
<h3>韓特使趙炳玉　訪晤杜魯門</h3>
<p>盼美續作軍事經濟援助</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕朝鮮總統李承晚之特別代表趙炳玉，本日曾訪晤杜魯門總統。事後渠吿新聞記者謂，渠對美國之援助朝鮮獲致獨立，曾向杜魯門先生表示感謝，此外並要求美國對朝鮮之幸福繼續表示關切，趙氏稱，朝鮮人民以及彼等在漢城新成立之民選政府，將繼續努力，以求南北韓之統一。惟渠曾吿杜魯門先生謂，朝鮮仍需軍事及經濟援助，藉以貫澈其國家計劃</p>
<h3>柏林空中走廓　蘇作傘兵演習　英接獲通知提出抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林五日電〕蘇官員五日通知盟國空中安全中心站稱，渠等將在離柏林二十英里外之空中走廊中，舉行降落傘演習，詳情並未發表。蘇方僅稱，跳傘演習將在走廊中舉行，在蘇聯兩處機塲二十五英里間，恰在柏林英區之邊緣·英方立卽抗議，認為此次行動違反安全協定，蘇方稱跳傘人員將在二千六百呎處開始降下，此舉顯將危害英國空連。因英機通常在二千呎之下飛行。</p>
<h3>美兩黨外保持一貫　柏林權利不放棄　范登堡警告蘇聯勿估計錯誤</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕共和黨外交政策高級策劃人范登堡參議員，昨夜發表廣播演說，盛讚美國之兩黨外交政策，指出此項政策得使國家以更大之團結精神發言，並使對外之攻策得以保持一言。渠說明政府政策成為兩黨政策之過程，並再提出警告謂，「任何觀念，凡以為吾人因在內政問題上意見不一，而以為吾人係屬有隙可乘者，實屬錯誤。」渠說明共和黨對歡洲復興計劃，援助希土協定，以及星約熱內盧條約之貢獻，並謂「余欲重予申明，此卽兩黨外交政策最精彩之表演。」在應付外交問題方面，吾人之團結猶如吾人之原子彈同樣重要，此項團結目前官為吾人謀取和平之最佳保證。吾人反對在蘇聯侵略下，輕易放棄在柏林之權利，此種權利一經放棄，如慕尼黑會議然，勢將貽意無窮。吾人譴責蘇聯口是心非，拒絕吾人解除柏林封鎖之和平建議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕范登堡在廣播演說中，譴責杜魯門政府在對華與對日方面並未遵守兩黨外交政策。</p>
<h3>美加强援法</h3>
<p>善救總署己趕辦結束中</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓五日電〕據美經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼四日晚透露，對美援中指定供法國用之法郞現款四十五億，為優待法國起見，將不加連結，此款將供法採購工業器材，以及重建商船之用。另有十七億法郞，則將作發展電力之用。霍夫曼繼稱。復興總署對法之其餘一半基金，則須視法國財政復與及貨幣穩定之進展如何，然後始能定奪凍結與否。</p>
<p>〔中央計華盛頓四日電〕聯合國救濟善後總署，現正趕辦結束中。理事會今通過一項計劃，立刻淸理帳目，將尙不應用之賢產，分配與世界衞生組織及聯合國國際兒童急救基金會。世界衛生組織分得美金一百萬元，此款平經撥付作衛生計劃實施之用，並經世界衛生組織聯合委會之批准，故現僅需作帳面上之移轉。聯合國國際兒童急救基金會，則分得一千一百六十七萬九千五百元·（非美國貨幣，且多數係不能兌換成美元者）。</p>
<h3>法工潮蔓延</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕在三十萬礦工舉行罷工使居伊政府感到焦頭爛額之後，又聞全法有廿萬之公務員在今日停止工作，惟全國局勢表面上尙屬安靜。外傳法政界現正在進行三黨聯合運動，允許共黨重行參加於政府之內，此一運動若干人士認為係阻止戴高樂當權之最佳辦法。但由於深恐此事可能引起美援之不利影響，故卽屬有此行動，其前途亦阻碍孔多。</p>
<h3>緬叛黨義勇圖　可與政府妥協</h3>
<p>將接受政府和平條件</p>
<p>〔本報訊五日〕倫敦廣播仰光訊：網匋官方稱：預料叛黨白人議勇團不久將接受和平條件，該黨原為被暗殺之國民黨盎桑之私人軍隊，為企圖推翻泰金諾總理之三集團之一。其餘兩個集團為紅旗共產黨（托派）及白帶共產黨（史達林派）。</p>

<h3>蘇將若干城市劃爲禁區　限制美人員活動　美對蘇外交人員可能採取報復</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓四日電〕國務部今日宣佈：美國駐蘇大使接獲蘇政府之通知，此後蘇聯若干城市及地區，禁止外國記者與外閃人員進入。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓四日電〕國務部發言人評蘇聯政府禁止外國記者與外交人員進入若干地區之新措置稱：此等於除莫斯科周國五十公里外，蘇聯全國已禁止外人訪問。且此五十公里周團內之若干地區，亦已列爲禁區。在理論上講，外國記者等原尙可訪問未列入禁區之各地，然欲赴任何城市必須經過是等禁區，故實際上等於蘇聯全國禁止通行矣。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕國務院鑒於蘇聯對美國外交人員不斷增加限制，正在考慮對美國境內之蘇聯外交人員，採取「報復。」</p>

<h3>翁院長電蔣督導員指示　煙酒等外槪不加稅　嚴查旅客限帶物品出境</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕翁院長文灝昨日親自用長途電話，與蔣經國治商滬市經管工作，並作兩項重要指示：（一）中央決定除烟酒等物品業已加稅者外，其餘各物，概不加稅。（二）自今日起，本市出境旅客，在海陸空三方面均將加强檢查，携帶物品以一人所需之必需品爲限，過此者予以沒收。此項辦法之目的，在妨止單帮走漏本市物資。又經管當局對目前競購物資現象，雖嚴予限制，但認爲無碍大局。發言人表示：只要工廠不停工，日用品來源充裕，競購物資可謂庸人自擾。至於奢侈品之搶購，更與民生無關。又訊：蔣經國於昨日上午九時，特偕張師赴申新九廠實地視察，並與負責人治談原料之供應問題。</p>
<h3>外菸售價凖予提高　暫先停止供應　辦理存貨登記</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨日下午邀集物炎供應局·貨物稅局·財政局及捲烟廠商代表開會，商討捲烟價依貨物稅增加比例調整後之外菸售價問題。決定辦理外菸存貨登記，通令公會轉飭各烟號烟店在外菸價格未定前暫停出售，外菸售價原則上准予按與國烟售價之比例提高，待詳細核定。</p>
<p>據悉，本市商人向貨物稅局登記之外菸存貨，共有五八六四大箱，每箱五萬枝，此外零星之條聽及物資供應局之存烟尙不在內。故外菸雖已禁止入口，但存貨與走私運入者</p>
<p>立斯牌外烟與美麗牌國烟售價之比例原爲三比一，現國烟貨物稅增高，售價比例已降爲一比一，甚且有外菸低於本市出產烟之售價者，吳局長認爲若不提高外菸售價，將逼使本市各烟廠關門，間接影響政府稅收，問題嚴重，故決定將外菸價格按比例提高，除辦理存貨登記外，並請物資供應局告知存貨數字，將來該局拋售價亦將提高。</p>
<p>無證外烟決予查禁</p>
<p>外烟行銷上海及全國各地者，有三五牌，茄立克，馬立斯，駱駝等五十二種，凡在市面發售，必須加貼財部捲菸統稅查騐證，否則即爲私貨，應予查禁。茲上海貨物稅局接獲確實密報，烟紙店及捲菸攤販仍有秘售無證外烟私貨情事，該局認爲行銷此種外烟私貨，足以防礙國菸三產，業已決定日內調派人員，實行突擊抽查，凡查獲無查騐證之外烟私貨，一律予以充公處分。</p>
<h3>三輪車價採分站制　定本星期六商議</h3>

<p>車夫收入一天十圓</p>
<p>三輪車人力車夫於幣制改革後，因車柤有限價而市民雇乘並無限價，多收人不惡，據悉現在三輪車夫一天收入恒在金圓十圓左右，但雙人三輪車車租每天祗法幣一百十五萬元。</p>

<h3>經管工作唯一執行機構　經營大隊組織擴大　隊員皆受特殊訓練　成立未久卓著功績</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近數月來，本市經管工作深受全國矚目。在經濟管制督導員指揮下，警局之經濟警察大隊實爲唯一執行機構，亦爲發揮經管效能之前哨。據該大隊統計，僅九月份渠等處理之經管案件卽達一千六百件以上，如林王公司·胡信義·韋伯祥·榮鴻元·詹沛霖等犖犖大者，均彰彰在市民耳目。　該機構之經常工作爲監視市塲，日以繼夜，艱苦非常，除須確實控制市塲之電訊電話外，更須隨時秘密佈置眼綫及搜集情報，其工作不同於刑事警察之着重事後偵查，而係在犯罪事實未揭露前卽作週密偵察，一至機會成熟，卽行行動，而其行動又每多在交易行爲進行時之一刹那間·故該隊全體均曾受特殊訓練，非心細如髮，卽難完成任務，如檢查倉庫工作，出動全隊人員，實施已近三月，爲經管工作奠定最切實之礎石，其間察·辨審·究，千頭萬緒，卒收成效。再如韋伯祥在本市經營大規模黑市金鈔，該隊早已偵伺甚久，惟爲求得確實罪證，曾費十五日以上之時間，專門記錄韋之對外電話及其個人行動，每日廿四小時內未嘗稍懈，故嗣後僅此一項紀錄，卽卷帙浩繁。韋本人機警異常，平日偶有交易或電話，均以暗語約定，詞意閃　，極難捉摸，渠被捕之夜，係挾一包裏乘三輪車赴某地，該隊根據前後調查所得之事實，認定時機成熟，遂突入掩捕，果發現其正在進行交易。其工作之讓巨概可想見。</p>
<p>胚胎於經濟監察團</p>
<p>目前一般市民對該隊之關切，正與日俱增，該隊年來活動經過，尤成大衆茶餘飯後之談助。實則該隊成立歷史甚短，迄今尙不足一年。其胚胎組織爲卅六年八月間，由市府有關各局及警備部稽查處合組之經濟監察團，當時在該團指揮下，警局設有金鈔組，由宣貼吾統一指揮，十一月該團撤銷，警局在行政處下增設經濟科，並另組經警大隊，由徐幼祚負責。至今年二月經警隊又併入經濟科，改由曹茂良接任，並在該科下設金鈔，日用品，燃料等股，原有隊員卽分配於各股服務。關三月間因事務繁重，科隊重行分組，經警再事編隊，此時即由現任之程義寬接長隊務。</p>
<p>程義寬隊長的略歷</p>
<p>外傳程當初係蔣經國推蔫來滬，並預爲佈置一切者，程對此曾加否認。渠自東吳大學畢業後曾入美國紐傑賽州立警官學校，及英國刑事警官學院先後攻讀，卅六年底始歸國，先供職營局外事股，，嗣調任斯盛副分局長，再轉經警大隊長，渠曾表示其經歷與外間種種猜測稍有距離。</p>
<p>今年六月，警局因適應環境需要，特成立特刑處，由副局長張師兼任處長，將原隸屬於行政處之經濟科及經警大隊劃入該處，爲求提高經警水準，又將原額七十名整編爲州名，調虹口警分局副分局長殷振名爲副大隊長，並派王思祖爲行動組長。八一九後蔣經國來滬，令警局以經管執行工作作爲該隊任務重心，並增調李念梓所領率之戡建一中隊與其混合編組。</p>
<p>將招考大學生百名</p>
<p>最近該隊因前於暑期中借用各大學之學生五十名已陸續返校，深感人手不足，將招考大學畢業生一百名，參加工作。目前當局爲加强該隊執行特資出境檢查工作，將設七個水陸檢查隊，由該隊會同戡建大隊，憲兵，及各區警局之員警混合組成。同時警局亦已通令各警分局，成立經濟管制組，由各分局長任組長，與該隊經常聯繫處理一般性之經濟管制工作。該隊自身亦已擴大組織，確定檢舉，行動，情報，監視四組，除組長四人外，更置班長十四人，並規定出勤時由班長率領，便衣，佩黃色臂章，帶出勤證。此外更編印「經檢手册」，詳細規定各項勤務要點。預料今後經管工作，必能在嚴密而妥養之佈置下，更得具體展開。</p>
<h3>展開勤儉運動　組織力行滬分會　推定籌備負責人</h3>
<p>本市各界勤儉人士，爲展開勤儉運動，特於昨日下午三時，在乍浦路軍之友社，舉行第二次勤儉運動座談會，交換意見，由方治主席，方氏首起立發言，謂勤儉運動之推行，在轉移社會窮奢極侈荒淫之惡習，樹立克勤克儉之風氣，此種運動之展開，在喚醒富有人士，意義至深重大，盼到會人士踴躍發言，提供寳貴意見，旋由章益發言。謂勤儉運動是樹立良好風氣，對奢侈人物精神上一種制裁，盼領導此種運動之人士，以最大勇氣，改造合理風氣。並提出「勤」要以不違背人情在情理中保特永久，「儉」在風俗習慣上應力求簡單，使生活合理化。秦潤卿氏謂勤儉應以身作則，使運動能擴大推行。王冠靑主張在衣食方面力求節約，增加生產，提倡正當娛樂。邱希聖希望在勤儉聲中以白開水招待客人，茶會禁止用茶點招待，創造一種新的風氣·范爭波希望勤儉運動做到澈底，力避流於形式化·徐鳴亞主張以組織推行遝動，用道德勸吿·最後通過：（一）羅敦偉提議，組織勤儉建國力行會上海分會，並當塲推定方治，潘公展，章益，朱經農，范爭波，徐寄廎，吳蘊初，謝仁釗，羅敦偉等二十三人負責籌備·（二）軍之友社現改由黨政軍各界共同主持，設備亦極合動儉原則，卽以此社爲「勤儉運動」示範機構，籌備處暫設該社，茶會至五時許散。</p>

<h3>宋子文主粵一年談感想</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　梁小中</p>
<p>〔本報廣州四日航訊〕十月三日是宋子文治粵的一周年紀念日，宋氏在前一天舉行了一次盛大的記者招待會，發表了不少含有深意的感想，記者們在一年裏這是第五次看到宋主席，也是第一次聽到宋主席爽朗的笑聲。</p>
<p>滿城風雨的下午，省府的會議　裏擠滿了等待消息的記者韋。三點敲過，宋主席昂首而進，短袖香港衫上面的扣子還沒扣好，就一直忙着向記者點頭，兩個鐘頭裏，面上的笑容從沒有觀去，一片笑影，很客易從這一副黝黑而又沉毅的面孔裏，想像到一個華南秋天裏的春天。</p>
<p>接受攻擊　引為快事</p>
<p>嚴肅的省政府會議廳，很少發現這樣輕鬆的塲面，宋主席才一開口，問上一句：「大家有什麼指敎？」記者立刻劈頭便送上一個有趣味的問題：「宋主席主粵一年，有些什麼感想？那一件事宋主席覺得量感愉快？」他似乎對這廣泛而又具體的問題感到有點躊躇，深深地抽上一口烟，這才以半開玩笑的口吻答覆道：「我的感想，不能算是感想，你們諸位記者先生的感想，才能眞正代表廣東人民的感想，所以我還是少說「點。至於我個人一年來最感愉快的一件事，莫過於這一段日子裏，京滬等地一部分不明眞相的人士對我個人的恣意攻擊，如果沒有他們的攻擊，便顯示出我沒有做事情，所以引不起他們反應的興趣，大槪正因為我所做的事情有進步，有一點成績，才會引起這一小部不明大局的人的攻訐，所以我主粵一年，當以此為第一快事」。這出於意外的「快事」，引起了一個鬨堂大笑之後，宋主席續以坦白態度檢討軍政措施的得失。</p>
<p>治安情形　值得安慰</p>
<p>關於剿匪問題，宋氏首先說明粵省一年來的治安較前大有進步，是他個人認為最値得安慰的一件大事，駐在省境國軍，年來因軍事上的需要，大部他調，惟自全省十五個　保團組編成功後，已足代替國軍力量有餘。一年淸剿結果，已使年前之遍地雈苻，皆已歛聲匿跡，舉如匪患最重的粵贛邊區，粵北及珠江三角洲的交通綫，目今都已暢通無阻，然而，他承認「剿匪容易，淸匪困難」，所以今後的主要軍事工作，將在組訓地方武力，加强自衛力量，務使匪患不能死灰復燃。至於外傳華南治安情形「不堪設想」之語，宋氏特以堅決之口吻稱「絕不承認！」</p>
<p>愼選賢能　吏治進步</p>
<p>接着談到吏治問題，宋氏首以感慨語調稱：「廣東吏治之壞，不始於今日，而始於諸位（指記者）還是小孩子的時候，」數十年相沿成習，一且革此積弊，實有不少困難。譬如說：「要找好人，但是「好人」，「壤人」，的確沒有招牌刻在額角上，一百多個都是好的縣長，尋起來可眞不容易，但是，他絕不因此灰心，並稱自渠蒞任後，愼選賢能的結果，證明吏治之風，已大有丕變，以前「若干萬港幣買一個父母官」的傳說，不但今後不復可聞，且將永遠絕跡。</p>
<p>建設經費　省方籌措</p>
<p>省府財政方面，目前省營事業的收入，巳較一年前增加兩倍，省方建設，舉如堤圍工程，增加警保力量，滃江永利建設，南嶺鐵路支綫的興建，賣埔建港等巨大事業需用款項，均係省方籌措，未需人民增加一分負祖。說到這裏，宋氏曾以愉快聲調表示：「亦只有這一點認為最對得起家鄕」，並表示今後將加緊建設，以底於成。以後財政支出好轉，第一步將增加公務人員的待遇</p>
<p>革除陋習　中國有救</p>
<p>末了談到近來最受非難的物價問題，有人說他沒有來的時候，廣州的物價不過是居全國的第二三位，他來了，廣州的物價一躍而居全國之首，他認為這不過是「職業攻擊者」的一糧藉口，不値作辦。尤其是對近來閙得頗兇的「粵省隱名人士發弊軍財」的問題，他特別請了廣東省銀行總經理杜梅和將廣東省銀行套購港匯五十九萬餘元購辦暹米備災這一會事，重複作了一次詳盡的報吿，並且很感慨地說：「中國有一句老話，呌做「明哲保身」，所以做官的人，大都是不求有功，只求無過」，今日更進一步而為「多做多錯，少做少錯，不做不錯。」所謂「分贓沒人駡，做事却有人駡」，這一種官塲陋習，一日不打破，中國絕對不可救藥，所以今後不做事則已，做事則必以良心血性與此輩奮鬥到底。一</p>
<p>最後，談到國家大事，他很明白的說：不久以前，他到香港確曾與李濟琛「以老朋友·老同事的資格勸他不要受共黨利用，做賣國勾當，」「但是，聽不聽只能由他去！」</p>
<h3>巢縣人看馮玉祥</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　寶白萍</p>
<p>〔本報巢縣一日訊〕素以一倒戈將軍」與「基督將軍」著稱於世的馮玉祥，在他故鄉巢縣人的眼裏，有如窮人家裏一件珍貴的妝飾品，無濟於窮的生活。馮玉祥從出生到發跡，都在華北，和巢縣一向沒有深切關係，巢縣人極少幾乎是沒有託庇他的地位而抖起來，巢縣人只把他看做一個「人物」，當為本縣的妝飾，此外就不再有什麼了。</p>
<p>然而他的名字一直是響亮的，婦孺們也知道「我們縣裏出了一個馮玉祥」！今年六月裏，他在美國有信到巢縣，說是住在紐約天氣熱了，要去鄉下避著，此後就不再知道他的去處。傳說太多了，到歐洲，到香港，還有說將回中國什麼「解放區」，他的行踪變成了一個謎，故鄕人正在細數他的生平為他歎息。</p>
<p>九月六日報紙上登出他死的消息，日是燒死在赴蘇旅途船上，這位四十年來叱咤風雲的人物，在中國政治上曾扮演多少悲劇的主角，如今竟以悲劇的命運結束了六十七歲的生命，這個死訊來得相當突兀。記者到巢縣時，有些人尙在半信半疑中。</p>
<p>竹柯村上</p>
<p>從巢縣出北門沿合巢公路北行，走渦二十多里，丘陵地把公路顯得起伏不平，當汽車爬上一個較大的坡坎後，看到坡坎下右邊坐落一個村莊，不過四十來家矮小的瓦屋和草屋毫無次序交錯在田塍間，吿訴你，這就是馮玉祥的原籍—巢縣夏閣鄉草鞋嶺下的竹柯村。</p>
<p>不知在什麼年代，這個村裏就住有姓馮的人家了，和普遍農民一樣，日出而作，日入而息，長年把時光打發在田野裏，因為地方荒凉，田地瘦瘠，農民們辛苦終年，能得一飽就算幸運了，多數人則是掙扎在饑餓綫上，直到今天，雖然這個窮鄉出了人物馮玉祥，而破落荒凉，和一般經濟破產的農村沒有兩樣。抗戰期中，日本人知道這里是馮玉祥的老家，加倍破壞，曾經馮氏住過幾十天的那兩間瓦房固蕩然無存，就連村莊上不是姓馮的人家，也遭了池魚之殃。它成為了一個破落的村莊。</p>
<p>衣錦還鄉</p>
<p>光緒七年，馮氏出生在河北靑縣興集鎭，童年時代整個在保定。民國二十六年二月，身任軍委會副委員長時候，他返到故鄕巢縣了，衣錦還鄉，在他最為恰當，當年在保定康格莊全家侷促一室家無隔宿之糧的馮基善，又何曾想到會有今日呢？第一次在鄉住了兩週去京，同年三月中，又返鄕住到四月底，這先後幾十天中，他一直住在竹柯村。</p>
<p>在鄉時，帶來一百萬棵松樹，還有洋槐和肥城桃樹，他發動附近農民植樹，如今，十年了，草鞋嶺上松樹蒼鬰，蔚然成林，但植樹的主人在異鄉已成骨灰，死而有知，該後悔不及見此是由於走錯了步子。</p>
<p>他把帶兵的方法也帶到鄕下了，愛施小惠，他組織敬老會，凡是附近五里路以內五十歲以上的人，都受到他的小惠，請吃酒飯，贈送粗布，講述飼養鷄鴨的方法，這都是鄕下人引為光榮而至感激涕零的，他們却意識不到馮氏對國家的功罪。</p>
<p>東方剛白的時候，這位返鄕的貴人起床了，一套藍組布短衫褲，配着布鞋布襪，眞難想到他就是副委員長。他挨戶敲門，凡是尙未起床的，他在門口以對士兵訓話的口吻呵斥懶惰，散步時會走下田帮着耕耘，不論什麼人求見，他會叨叨絮絮講些史喂養牲口的經驗，最後還會客氣兩句：「我是小人物，只能談一些小事情。」在馮氏自己想，總算沒有白走這一趟。</p>
<p>這是他生平第一次還鄕，然而，這也是他生平最後的一次。</p>
<p>馮門凋零</p>
<p>馮氏的父親馮有茂，原是竹柯村一個泥瓦匠，弟兄四人，馮有茂是老二，老大死得很早，如今絕嗣無後，老三是裁縫，老四是佃農，家境貧寒，一向分居度日。洪楊革命時，馮有茂以家無恒產，在逃難時走得很遠，就在山東濟寗和一家姓游的女子結了婚。所生子女七人，據馮氏「我的生活」中說：「兄弟們營養不足，死去五個。」賸下的就是他的長兄馮基道（號志齋）和他自己了。聽說馮基道現在已逾七十，住在北平，原配夫人生有兩子，均巳去世，續弦的也生了兩子。馮基道就帶着兩子一孫，正過着很淸苦的日子，已多年沒有南歸了。</p>
<p>馮氏原配夫人姓劉，長子鴻國，今年已四十三歲了，同乃父一樣是個軍人。卅五年馮氏出國前，最高當局特許他進了陸軍大學，據說現在仍在重慶，進陸大時他僅做了一個孩子的爸爸，二子鴻治，三十四年就到美國學機械去了，兩年前在美和一位華僑的女兒結了婚，現在學業尙未完成。兩個女兒出嫁在北方，情形如一何，在巢縣沒有人知道。和李德全是續弦的，生了三女一男，長女理達，此次伴同馮氏葬身火窟，其餘皆隨馮氏同陣赴美的·</p>
<p>現在的竹柯村，約有十家馮姓，除掉三四兩房後裔外，其餘都是馮氏遠房本家，大家同樣穿着草鞋在草鞋嶺下春耕夏耘，寒暑無間。在竹柯村的馮家，人口是相當凋零的。</p>
<p>公館寂寞</p>
<p>廿六日那天，一個陰沉的上午，記者在巢縣小東門找到喊得最響亮的馮公館。這座公館坐東朝西，高牆黑門，在這小地方就少有，走進大門，一個很大院落，一切都是重新修理油漆的，當中三大間，足够容納四五十位客人，地板發亮，很可用做家庭舞廳，然而許多西式傢俱乃至沙發，都橫七暨八堆存在裏面，一望而知道位主人沒有住進來，整個都浸沉在寂寞中，似乎在為着死於重洋外的主人默哀。</p>
<p>在院落北邊的客廳裏，找到公館臨時主人王羣賢先生，他是馮氏堂弟竹初的佳婿，在馮氏身邊當過多年副官，感謝他殷勤接待，並吿訴我這房子的來歷。</p>
<p>卅五年五月，馮氏復員還都，船經蕪湖，他命王先生回巢看看有無住處，王先生覆命在支離破爛的巢縣，房荒嚴重，一時沒有可住的地方，馮氏決定買座房子，這是他在故鄕購置產業的第一次。王先生回巢，很快就買得葛姓這座房子，當時價値八百五十萬元，共計廿三間，另外屋後還有一塊空地，去年春天修理完成，現在由這位王先生看管着。</p>
<p>十二年前，馮氏知道張治中在故鄕黃麓辦了學校，他也就在竹柯村附近辦起團山學校，計劃中由小學到中學，成立不久，燬於日軍的砲火。勝利後，準備復校，乃在買臘後又在老家附近先後買了三百畝田地，說是作為學校基金，但這個學校一直沒有恢復，恐怕今後也再沒有恢復的時候了。</p>
<p>王先生說自從六月裏接馮氏下鄉避暑的信以後，迄今不再有信來，夫人李德全也沒有任何電信一，除報上消息外，他和一般人同一樣的不知其他·</p>
<p>蓋棺論定</p>
<p>巢縣參會議長潘宗鵬先生，保定三期畢業，他和馮氏有同學之雅。當記者向他叩詢對馮氏觀感時，他沉吟了很久，他說站在同鄉地位，似乎不該在他死後加以批評，不過一向不贊成他的做人。民九年，馮任十六混成旅旅長時，在漢口劉家廟和他晤面，直覺地感到他治軍虛偽。十七年成立軍政部，馮任部長，原來內定張治中為陸軍署長，但張力辭，為着馮多變，不願和他共事。他還揭發了馮氏一個隱私，他說馮氏在保定時，對原配夫人外表特別表示好感，忽在一天夜裏，夫人無疾而終，據說是馮把她害死的。</p>
<p>記者訪問一位七十老人時，（他不願露名），他否定了馮氏一切，他說一個當大兵出身的人，懂得士兵心理是有餘，眞正肩負國家重任，那就談不上子。馮玉祥乳名呌「科寳」，原名「基善」，「馮玉祥」三字是他最初當兵時一個管帶臨時替他起的。看他一生事蹟，每多臨時投機取巧。巢縣出這樣人物，站在國家立塲說，並不光榮。</p>
<h3>防止奸匪襲擊　吳興訂五辦法</h3>

<h3>長春西南鬼門關　被截難胞面臨飾物斃的厄運</h3>
<p>— 江漁洋</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽一日訊〕長春，正如浪花衝擊中之孤島，堅持屹立，市內自驟添吉林撤出難胞十餘萬後，食指激增，市內旣無耕耘之田，又乏進糧之路，燃料自去年末已吿斷絕，所存無幾，發電當然無能為力，夜無照明之光，出無代步之乘，在艱辛中勉力掙扎。自五月廿四日共匪嘯聚蒙古·朝鮮·聯合武力在長春週圍，加强圍攻，機塲失守，飛機不能降落，市內米價隨吿上昇，民衆祗有找野草，瓜花，豆秧，樹皮來充饑，一邊賣去箱底，換取米糠，酒糟，豆餅一類的東西配合呑食。糟糠，豆粕，樹皮之類，原非人食，食之不僅有碍營養，且患消化器病，以致普遍性眼疾與胃腸炎，廣泛發生，身體日漸瘦弱，蓬髮汚面，終至相繼倒斃於僻巷頹垣，陋室溝堅之間。長春人正在如此扮演着空前未有的慘劇中的主角。</p>
<p>空校食糧</p>
<p>空投食糧，是何等艱鉅的工作，共匪的目的「斷絕市內吃糧，促成自潰或餓斃百姓，離散士兵」，在手段上除利誘士兵交槍出圍之外，極力用高射砲威脅空運，飛機則不得不高翔騰雲。低空投下，當然難期百分之百投在市內，而且每袋有限度，於是千辛萬苦投下的吃糧，祗得充為軍用。百姓們雖然分不到，對於空投食糧却萬分歡迎，每當飛機飛到長春上空時，市民均出而仰望喝彩，這可以說是他們的唯一的安慰。</p>
<p>在交易塲上，所看到的盡是賣傢俱衣飾之類，其價雖賤，竟亦無人過問，泰發和一類商塲早已冷落閉門自守，成交點款較多數者用秤衡量輕重，判定數目，銀行臨時發行的本票，均是億額為單位，低級行員每月可拿四十億券幣。祗是有糧的人是黃金時代。以少量米便可換得許多東西，美麗嬌柔的少女，十斤米便得做非願之嫁，一條褲子不過換一很細葱，飢餓勢如洪水猛獸，侵襲着長春個個善良百姓，他們四顧餓殍橫陳，一片凄凉景象，友好之間互視而嘆吁，又不知何時被釩餓的魔手攫去生命，於是冒險突圍，一批一批的却被重重匪哨截阻在洪熙街，人數已達十六萬之衆了，打算出走反被猙獰的共匪截阻了他們的生路。</p>
<p>重重匪哨</p>
<p>洪熙街在長春西南，距市有三公里之遙，緊接着郊區，在日偽時代，那邊都是些日人官吏住宅，現已拆得祇剩空殼，在其外祿與郊區相隣之處，便有重重的匪哨。被截阻在裏面的難胞，都是欲突出崗哨覓食的，盡夜在期望着鬼門關的放行，有的送槍或銀圓買條生路，或在夜間一爬出，不幸被發現了便立刻決定了他的悲運，看裏面的等待放行的人，多數是瘦骨嶙峋，無精打彩，坐臥不寗，有的在尋覓靑草野花果腹，在街裏有親朋的人，尚可藉郵索取補給，無親朋的很可能就在這個地方成為他們最後的墓地。</p>
<p>餓殍盈野</p>
<p>一個慘痛的鏡頭，就是被棄的孩兒們，在哭喊着他們的媽媽直到沒有氣力，躺在地下呻吟許久不見有人管她，也許她的媽媽餓斃在十步之外，而這些孩子的生命也就被無情的死神所戄去。看到這些可憐的棄兒，當然十分痛心的同情他們，然而又怕自己的兒女也帶不出去，所以就無餘力去顧及。再走出十步二十步之外，更可以看到餓殍橫陳，白骨盈野的悲慘景象，旣無棺槨盛殮，亦無人代為掩埋，光着全身，簡直是無異狗猫的死屍·等待出　的人們觸景生情，解除他們的死亡的命運。假若走不出這幾道鬼門關，將來無疑和那些骷髏作伴侶罷。</p>
<p>記者在　接觸由長春逃出者數人，聽述悲慘事實，不禁黯然傷感，謹紀所述，供諸社會熱心同胞之前，希共同參加長春輸糧救死運動，並向長春駐軍予以精神上的最大支援。</p>
<h3>北平天壇一兇案　借貸未遂下毒手　兇犯李榮鴻向警局自首</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕平天壇昨又發生兇殺案，兇手為瀋陽退役空軍官佐名李榮鴻，於四日向其友人趙萬雲借貸未遂。因而懷恨，約至天壇內，用刺刀猛向趙之頸背刺十二刀，殺畢赴警局自首，趙未送至醫院卽死，兇手正嚴訊中。</p>
<h3>承德平朱間六沟鎭　匪設地窖悶死活人</h3>
<p>〔本報承德一日航訊〕六沟，是承德平泉中閒最大的鄉鎭，此次光復後，鐵路不通，這里便成為承平間唯一的通衢要道。　六沟鎭被匪佔據後，到現在整整四個月，經記者前往巡視，始悉，居民夏季的食糧，早已被匪系掠一空，靑壯年被拉走十餘名，其次是給匪當保甲長的人都跑了，後來聽說國軍寬大，又逐漸回來了。共匪在六沟的作風，發明了一種「蹩死人」的刑罰，他們把住民潘雨亭的院子改作區公所，在屋裏挖了一個地窖，把捉來的人放在裏面，上口蓋好大磨盤，便可把人活活悶死，據鄰人說：「坐地窖的人很多，但都解走了，悶死的有一個，是南沟山馬明雲的兒子，處死刑的原因，是為了違欠徵糧」。</p>

<h3>二五減租在浙江　給「糊塗地主」敲喪鐘</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>〔本報杭州二日訊〕陳儀主浙以後，在他的施政方針中最為人注意的，是「溫和的土地改革」，因為土地問題是中國經濟的根本問題，如果土地問題得以合理解決，農村就可安定下來，都市遂能有持久的繁熒。當陳氏把土地政革列為今年下半年度的省政工作時，無論是地主或農民，省內或省外，都非常注意這個工作的推進。但是最近陳氏却對記者說：「浙江的地權問題並不嚴重，由於浙江的人口分布太不均勻，浙東少田而多人，浙西多田而少人，有計劃的移民，就可以解決大部分的土地問題了。」省府旣決於卅八年舉辦移民，目前就集中力量，以澈底實施二五减租，代替土地改革，來减輕農民的負担。</p>
<p>二五减租是一種調和佃業雙方利益以安定農村的措施。革命政府在廣州成立後首先試行於兩廣，後來逐漸推行至兩湖，江浙諸省。浙江從民國十六年推行迄今，，總算沒曾和其他各省一樣地被地方封建勢力阻撓摧殘而停頓。這是浙江的榮耀。廿一年來，經過黨，政，司法機關的努力，不能說沒有相當成績，照去年浙省社會處的「浙江省各縣市二五减租實施概况」調查表中，得知在减租以前一般租額平均是佔全年正產物的百分之五十點六，而减租後則為百分之三十七點五五，佃農的租佃負担平均减少了百分之一三點〇五較二五减租的標準僅逾百分之〇點〇五的平均差數。這數字，看起來是很好的成績，但就實際情形來說，一部分縣份根本尙未推行，（未報减租情况的就有富陽，平湖，崇德，桐　鄉，吳興，象山，湯溪　，永嘉，仙居等九縣）有的縣份祇推行於一部份鄕村，或是减租祗限於有永佃權的田地。顯然的，二五减租在浙江還未做到普遍澈底的地步。據社會處的調査全省租額佔年正產物百分之五十以上的尚有新登，於潛，鎭海，定海，紹興，諸曁，嵊縣，天台，臨海等九縣，百分之四十以上的十四縣，租額最高的安吉竟達年正產物的百分之七十五。一般的說來，農會組織健全，佃農有永租權的地區，多能實行二五减租，而由於耕地與人口分配關係的異樣，浙西的成績略較浙東為佳。</p>
<p>推行不澈底主因</p>
<p>過去推行二五减租之所以不能普遍，澈底，甚至於停頓，其主要的困難在：（一）地主土豪劣紳的勢力過大，他們或由於歷史傳統的地位，或由於執掌鄉村的政權，一葉利用權勢，維護自已的利益，使佃農無力抗禦。（二）主刁頑取巧，或巧立租約，維持原額，或於秋收時預付第二年租金，其租額常超過年正產量半數。而佃農不凖時繳預租者，另召他人耕種。（三）農會組織的不健全，或竟為地主把持，致無法推行。而行政司法機關執行不力，且因當局者多為地主，佃業糾紛亦有未能公平處理。要破除這些基本的障礙，主要的靠主辦的人有堅强的勇氣和毅力，而且不要再讓地主土劣之流混入執行機構，蠢蝕革命的熱情·關於後者，陳主席除了規定各級農會應徵收大量佃農雇農為會負，各鄉農會理事並須有過半數為佃農外，並曾號召靑年們向惡勢力鬥爭。這是一個好的起點。</p>
<p>拯救糊塗的地主</p>
<p>壩儀自己對二五減租確實下過最大的決心，他在八月十九日浙省第一五七〇次省府委員會議中，曾剴切地說：「……今年年內，全省各地的二五减租，必須普遍地做到。這工作自應由行政機關執行，但如惡勢力的阻力太大，在此戡亂時期，我們不必過份拘泥普通法令，逕可以堅强的力量來澈底推行二五减租的法令。為了對抗共黨的土革運動，為了拯救一般糊塗的地主免受共黨淸算鬥爭的痛苦，為了實行總理平均地權的遺敎，我們必須拿出革命的精神來，拿出的革命的手段來，堅定地勇敢地做去。卽使有些地方偶與法令不合之處，我願意對中央負責。如果有地主阻礙二五减租的政令，甚至有因二五减租而放刁不租的，不管他地位如何高，權勢如何大，儘管嚴峻執行好了。……」</p>
<p>注視革命的行動</p>
<p>這一段話說得堅決有力，完全是「鐵腕政治」，的語氣，對那些兩浙的「糊塗的地主」，畢竟是一聲喪鐘，對那千萬被壓榨的佃農雇農，無異是一盤黎明的號角。但在今日最求實現的農村裏，政治不是靠宣傳，而是靠實際行動的。陳主席要安定浙江的農村社會經濟，要在今年年內全省各地普遍實施二五减租，那就不能單靠他底「革命的精神」，主要的在靠他底「革命的行動」。浙江千餘萬的農民被他底黎明的號角吹醒了，正眼睜睜地在注視着他底行動之出現。</p>

<h3>香港貨物運入中國口岸　海關加強檢查手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：過去由香港運華貨物之報關手續，除普通進口艙單及轉口艙單外，並應呈驗香港當局簽證之出口艙單副本。頃悉海關當局爲加强進口檢查起見，對此又有新規定，辦法如次；</p>
<p>（一）從香港來船所載進口包裏（包括由船長轉交者在內）</p>
<p>此項包裏除詳列普通進口艙單或進口包裏淸單外，均應逐一呈騐原起運口岸所發之句裏收據，其出香港運出之句裏，並應呈騐香港當局簽證之出口艙單或由香港政府港務局簽證之出口包裏淸單，其上並應詳載各包裏收據號碼，上項包裏其不能呈騐原起運口岸之包裏收據者，或在香港起運而不能呈騐簽證之出口艙單或包裏淸單者，一槪視爲「未列艙單貨物」，由關予以扣留按章處理。</p>
<p>（二）通運貨物由船舶自香港運往中國口岸途經其他中國口岸者。</p>
<p>凡船舶由香港開赴兩個或兩個以上之中國口岸者，除備具香港當局簽證之出口艙單及普通進口艙單向指運之中國口岸海關呈騐外，（甲）應於到達第一中國口岸時，將該船所駛往其他中國口岸之各別通運艙單及香港當局簽證之出口艙單呈交登船檢查之關員騐收。（乙）此後於到達其餘中國各口岸時，亦應分別向登船檢查之關員，交出其次駛往各口岸之通運艙單。至於各該船舶如未載有指運中國口岸之通運貨物，亦應塡具空白通運艙單，或在進口艙單之尾，添一附註，聲明「無通運貨物由香港運來」。如有輪船對此項辦法不予遵辦，其經理之公司，應負責聽候海關罰辦。</p>
<p>（三）由香港空運來華貨物。</p>
<p>此類貨物除備具普通進口艙單外，並須呈騐香港政府主管機構簽證之出口艙單，凡香港出口艙單未列之貨，雖載在進口艙單，亦作「未列艙單貨物」處理以上辦法自卽日起實行。</p>
<h3>外商銀行增資　財部指示要點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金管局頃奉財政部令，指示商業銀行增資辦法中有關外商銀行各點。略開：「各在華外國銀行，其本公司均不設在我國境內「商業銀行調整資本辦法」第三條所規定之商營銀行實收資本最低額，自應以原呈請財部認許之代表行所在地區爲凖。其在不同縣市區域，設有分支行處者，每一行處應以增加十分之一計算。又「商營銀行調整資本進行程序」第二條所定召開開股東會討論增資辦法一節，得以免除，惟應依公司法第三百五十五條規定，由其本公司指定之代表（或在中國境內代表行之經理）或代理人呈請，其餘各節，均應依規定辦理。金管局頃已將財部此項指示，通知本市銀行公會轉知各外商銀行卽日實施。</p>
<h3>銀錢業調整拆息</h3>
<p>銀錢信託三公會昨經開會決議，自今日（六日）起將放款日拆改爲每千元一元三角，同業日拆改爲每千元八角，存款日拆改爲每千元四角五分。</p>
<h3>去年秋蘭貸款　農行停止舉辦</h3>
<p>據中國農民銀行消息：當局爲緊縮貨款，吸收通貨，對本年度、；貸款決定停止貸放，若千蠶農繭商曾向該行請求開貸，該行表示在幣制改革以後實無此必需。因目前利息甚低，除農行外，該商等即使缺乏資本，儘可向其他銀行請貸。目前市上游資極多，正可藉此機會導游炎入農村及工業云。</p>
<h3>絲市交易呆滯</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况仍俏，趨勢甚呆，本街門銷略見淸淡，絲織業配期又屆，人心平穩。惟連日各種物資搶購熾烈，人心頗多刺激，公會配售數量仍不變化，配量微細，形成粥少僧多。生絲在限價下交易寥寥，外銷頗有起色，惟市上無貨可進，市况亦冷。</p>
<p>綢緞夏季各貨業已落市，冬令女式貨日來因受紗布等貨搶購風氣，本街門銷，亦有供不應求之勢，被面在限價下供售甚少，進出均呆。</p>
<h3>糖市漲跌互見</h3>
<p>食糖昨日市况平穩，各檔漲跌互見，緣本街去化稍呆，人心散漫，　面頗多觀望，交易轉稀。廿一期砂白開後吐納平疲，收市略見好轉，中砂粗砂亦見帶升，四五號車白精吸戶觀望，執戶脫意稍鬆，收市微有軋挫，其餘平穩。</p>
<h3>茶市腳地鞏固</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，交易賡續下游，良以持貨者鑒於產區毛茶巍站高峯，而到源又頗滯狹，故一味居奇，猶豫不前，是以市上售樣未旺，輸出商買氣雖仍四溢，卒呈向隅狀態，成交數量步吿遜落。若千種花色，幾成有市無貨之狀，潛勢則均吐秀氣。至於內銷茶亦因供售籌碼短促，太街與蘇錫等地，成有悅胃，脚地比前更見硬紥。</p>
<h3>昨到貨空前銳减　米市場情况蕭條　雜糧交易少食油供應幾絕</h3>
<p>米市到貨再見减少，南市塲到三百五十四石七斗，內有糙米二百零五石，北市塲到貨奇缺，不滿一百石，祗八十七石五斗，二市共計四百四十二石，是日以市塲交易仍未見開出，而市塲報價亦减少，整個米市冷靜已極，至十時，同業均已離去。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>市場停市如故，同業大都已不到市場，往日倍見熟鬧，現在則岑靜奄無生氣。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>交易再見减少，黃豆開出更少，鄱陽子黃豆祗七包零星開出，價格十三元八角。鄱陽子黑豆開出二百餘包，價十二元，亦爲本街消化。苞米，紅糧，荼豆，蠶豆，元麥，均不開出，芝蔴交易尙多，但供方亦已轉淡，生仁新南京生仁續有開出，價三十五元七角。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>全市祇開熟菜油數十桶，價為四十三元三角，其他未有交易，上日廠方配售，因中植廠中途變卦，發生意見，故暫伴配出，且其他油廠亦不能配出，致市上供懸幾絕，零售商大感缺貨。又昨日警局特派流動警員二人，在塲維持秩序，但市塲秩序甚佳絕無率故發生。</p>
<h3>食米雜糧三市場　將停止集體交易</h3>
<p>繼紗布兩市塲停止交易之後，本市米麵粉雜糧三市塲亦將停止交易，其停止之原因有三：</p>
<p>（一）自幣制改革後，該三市塲內之交易，卽日趨淸淡，來源稀少，所有米，麵粉，雜糧之會員，大半均停止往市塲買賣，市塲內每日成交數量極少。</p>
<p>（二）因市塲內之來源稀少，各零售米商現均自行向各產區牧購，運滬銷售，爲數雖少，但已儘够維持一個店之門售。</p>
<p>（三）市塲停止交易，產區及零售商之間可避免中間商人之剝削，米價可能更低。基於各種原因，各該市塲在目前已無存在之必要云。</p>
<h3>開潔煤十萬噸　補充本市燃料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行物資財務委員會於昨（四日）下午五時，舉行第九次會議，由召集人李立俠主席，討論議案多起。據聞對於各方要求委託收購國棉案件，以國棉聯購處業已成立，爲符合統一收購原旨起見，均暫從緩議。又關於四聯總處泱議職開滐煤斤十萬噸一案，該會建議分三個月，在上海交齊，以補充本市燃料之匱乏云。</p>
<h3>紗商代表謁蔣督導員　請速頒佈配銷細則　紡建公司昨循例配售棉布</h3>
<p>本市棉紗市塲奉上海區經濟管制督導員諭，業已停止交易。昨據紗商業公會唐理事長稱：該會自奉令於前日起停業後，六百二十家同行業務隨之陷入停頓狀態，惟門市紗號現仍繼續營業，一俟存紗售罄，亦將自動停業，尙有居間商四百四十人，均因此而吿失業。該會昨（五日）晨又派代表赴國行晋謁蔣督導員請示，並要求從速頒佈配銷細則，俾可早日恢復業務，以維生存。</p>
<p>昨日棉布爲奉令停市之第二日，塲內外雖均無交易，但內衣廠及西服廠均需要裏布，染織廠及紡建公司則無派給，形勢甚感恐慌，龍頭·五福·喇叭童·等細布及元嗶嘰，頗見緊俏。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司循例配售棉布，計有十二磅陽鶴B字細布價每疋廿三元六角，四君子元直貢呢廿九元八角，又元嗶嘰廿八元二角，元絲光布卅三元，四十二碼老壽星漂布廿六元八角，平均四十二碼灰細布廿七元三角，廿九碼半副牌嗶嘰坏廿三元三角，虹光精元紗貢緞廿八元三角。二等品淺色印花色汀十八元，又淺色花洋紡十八元二角，又卅碼龍鬚十磅粗布十八元，丁四碼元細布每磅二元零五分。又草黃卡其一元九角七分，並限門售商購，跳鯉七七七常靑嗶嘰廿七元六角六分，限染廠購。副牌29碼半嗶嘰坏廿三元三角，及二等品40碼十磅坏布廿五元六角六分，共計十五種。又美墨色布四種，各戶限購一種，聞有少數字號出售准購單加價二元餘，其他各布均可加碼，故申購者頗踴躍。</p>
<p>又訊：棉布公會開配機器染織業公會之布疋，約計二萬六千餘疋，由該業會員塡單請購，共有十七萬疋，以供求失衡，故該公會再度採取抽籤方式云。</p>
<p>棉市仍冷</p>
<p>現棉市上仍未聞有做開，市况形成優持，各檔無價無市。聞滬郊近地日凍新棉已經登塲，惟棉農售意甚懈，主因聞爲花價與米價不能合算，故交易淸稀</p>

<h3>銀錢盃乒乓賽　上海輕取建昌</h3>
<p>日前銀錢盃乒乓賽銀字組上海與建昌對壘於中行球室，前者籃球隊素稱譽於銀錢界，乒乓隊停頓已久，此番由王領隊宗釐之督促，東山再起，前日初試鋒芒，老將陸吉星張鴻生，以及新人陳權。楊永康。凌克誠三小將，平均發展，輕易以十三對二大獲勝利，建昌方面全材谷生輝袖手旁觀，亦爲慘敗之主因。茲探錄戰績如下：</p>
<p>上　海　勝　負</p>
<p>楊永康　三　〇</p>
<p>凌克誠　二　一</p>
<p>陸吉星　三　〇</p>
<p>陳　權　三　〇</p>
<p>張鴻生　二　一</p>
<p>建昌　勝　負</p>
<p>張永頣　一　二</p>
<p>鄭保圫　〇　三</p>
<p>嚴志民　〇　三</p>
<p>忻可權　〇　三</p>
<p>張永齡　一　二</p>
<p>前日錢組友邦對壘浦東，雙方實力懸殊，戰成一面倒，友邦從容戰，陸沈濤獨破四關，鋒芒畢露，結果友邦以十三對三痛擊浦東，旗開得勝。另幕業組浙實出戰中國白於四明球室，首圈中中國白以一對四落後，此後雖加鞭力追，但終無法超出，惟頗予對方威脅，惜乎因首圈之失分過多，遂成出師不利之恨，結果浙實以十三對七克服中國白。</p>
<p>今（六）日續有四塲交鋒，失意於三屆乙組乒乓聯賽之春茂，自將以全力奪取錢組冠軍，對手中農農陣容中，尙無此中健者，恐將不堪春茂一擊，餘如花旗四明實力堅銳，勝劵可操。茲錄昨日結果如下：</p>
<p>友邦勝浦東（錢）十三—三</p>
<p>浙實勝中國白（業）十三—七</p>
<p>（今日秩序）</p>
<p>華僑—東萊（銀）六時中國</p>
<p>花旗—中央乙（銀）六時花旗</p>
<p>春茂—中農農（錢）六時中農</p>
<p>四明—新華（業）六時四明</p>

<h3>中學盃排球賽　聯賽規程公布開始報名</h3>
<p>市體育館主辦之中學盃排球聯賽，已於昨日開始報名，該館爲協助本市中等學校促進課外活動，提倡範圍較大之校際排球比賽，使參加學校，切磋球藝，聯絡感情，增進競賽興趣，配合勤儉建國遝動，用意深切，凡本市中等學校已有排球隊之組織者，歡迎參加。茲將聯賽規程摘要錄下：</p>

<h3>明晚籃球表演賽　回力出場戰混合　晚七時在市體育館</h3>
<p>本市體育記者聯誼會原定今晚主辦籃球表演賽一塲，邀請混合隊出戰大公，但臨賽前夕，大公隊忽表示謂須辦理出國手續，及注射防疫針等，無暇出塲。按聯誼會於週前曾接獲該隊當局正式覆函，接受邀請，臨時悔約，不勝遺憾。據一般推測，大公上次慘敗於輜汽後，隊員精神，大受打擊，表演必形遜色，以敵華聯晨友混合隊，勝負殊無把握，此種怕輸心理，或爲不能出塲原因之一。體育記者聯誼會以一切籌備，均已完畢，決定改邀回力隊出塲表演，對抗混合，明晚（星期四）七時，在體育館舉行。回力隊近請錢旭滄祖任顧問，並曾於前週遠征京錫凱旋而歸，屆時必有精彩表演。至混合集華聯與晨友精銳，擁有世運代表多名，餘將亦俱屬海懦第一流名手，戰力可畏，與回力勢有一塲龍爭虎鬥。回力主將曹志吉因事赴京，正泰廠當局昨日特急電召回，以增厚實力。</p>
<h3>勝利盃排球</h3>
<p>聖約翰獲泱賽權</p>
<p>勝利盃球賽，昨晚落選錦標，複賽各一塲，落選複賽，震華與繁星角逐，震華以合作緊凑三對零克敵奏功，將於八日與貼馬作落選錦標賽。</p>

<h3>微弱的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>爲了生活，也許是偶然的機會，我又恢復了拋却了十多年的敎書生活；而且一教又上三年，而且所敎的又是「頗著聲譽」的學校。</p>
<p>以我這樣的「師資」夾在「　著聲譽」的學校里，最先，眞有點惶恐，更有點「充數」的羞慚。然而日子一久，「充數」的感覺逐漸的淡下去了，而對「頗著聲譽」的聲譽的懷疑，倒擴展開來。</p>
<p>我的所謂「充數」，其癥結在於自已是爲生活而敎書—便是把敎席看作職業；不但沒有「爲敎育而敎育」的精神，更沒有「樂育英才」的高尙意志；一句話，吃飯而已。以這姿態踏進神聖的敎育界，「內疚」該是一個天良未泯盡的人應有的譴責吧？</p>
<p>然而日子一久，不但不再「內疚」，反而有點自傲了。因爲眼看着同仁們，不但沒有「爲敎育而敎育」的精神，便是把敎席當作職業而一本正經的幹的也極少，充其量，只不過把它看成一個副業。</p>
<p>要證據嗎？眞個俯拾卽是。</p>
<p>記得每當學期開始，半年的薪水發下來之後，敎員室里便馬上潮漫着一片物價的聲音：黃金，美鈔，棉紗以及什麼什麼的談話，眞個是此唱彼和，鬧成一片；接着是你進什麼我進什麽，合股的也有，單做的也有（當然爲歡極少）。再後來便又跟着所進物價的高下，盈餘的興高彩烈，自誇獨具法眼，虧蝕的垂頭喪氣，懊悔通連。試問在這種或緊或弛的情况中，還有多少精神來從事培植下一代的工作？能敷衍下去的已經是高才了。</p>
<p>這現象，當然不能單責備教員，敎員也不能負擔這環境所以構成的責任。神聖的工作，是不能求之於牛衣對泣兒女啼飢號寒的人們的。然而這是事實，這是勝利以來兩年多敎育界的事實！</p>
<p>我的對於「頗著聲譽」者聲譽的懷疑是：「聲譽」只是它的外表而不是它的內容。舉例說，讀經早成笑話，而論語或孟子則成爲初中的必要課本。至於高中則要做什麼什麽論，什麼什麽議；題目越古越顯得敎師的淵博，越長越顯得敎師的卓絕，而文章也便是古香古色，非唐卽宋了。秩序又是它們所特重的，敎師只要有方法把學生們變成一個個的本偶，排列在敎室里，便是一等敎師。至於管敎的方法，却一切隨便你，打手心可以，罰跪也不妨。總之，你能把學生造成一個個未成年的老人，便是你的「敎績」。</p>
<p>這情形，似乎也遍佈於二十世紀中葉的今日的中國敎育界！</p>
<p>這情形是痛心的，然而在以敎育爲點綴品的今日的情况下，又是當然的。因而我們下一代的情形如何，也可以想象了。</p>
<p>誰能剷除敎師們以敎席作副業的卑鄙心情，誰能揭破或革除「頗著聲譽」者的虛僞聲譽，才是眞正的中國英雄，民族救星！</p>
<p>爲着我們的下一代，我願將兩年多來耳聞目覩的摧殘靑年的不合理的敎育現象，發出這微弱的呼聲。</p>
<h3>批評家</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>在一個春光明媚的早晨，芬蘭的著名作曲家西倍里盍斯帶了他的學生到森林中漫步。烏語花香，正是極好的天氣。</p>
<p>西倍里盍斯一向喜歡在樹林裏散步，所以一聽見各種烏嗚的聲音，就能辨別出這是什麼烏。他們一面走，西倍里盍斯就一面把任種烏的名字吿訴他的學生。</p>
<p>忽然，來了一只烏鴉，哇哇的呌得非常難聽，擾亂了森林裏美麗的天籟</p>
<p>「那是什麼烏呢？」西借里盍斯的學生問。</p>
<p>那位大音樂家非常厭惡地回答說：</p>
<p>「批評家。」</p>
<h3>吃飯問題</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>近來英國糧食頗成問題，有個英國人說：一爲什麼我們不能多產糧食？因爲我們要輸出農業機器。爲什麼要輸出？因爲使外國多產糧食。爲什麽要他們多產糧食？好使他們輸出給我們。爲什麼要多輸出給我們？因爲我們不够吃。爲什麼我們不够吃？因爲我們必須輸出……」這不是笑話。笑話是政治。</p>
<p>看年來英美雜誌，頗以地寡人衆糧食大成問題爲念。聯合國有一個糧食與農業機構，曾大聲疾呼警吿世人：恢復戰前糧食水準已無濟於事，因爲世界的人口在日日增又日增。</p>
<p>有辦法沒有？有的。假如英國不輸出農業機器，努力增產，英倫三島或可自給自足。但政府非輸出不可—換點外匯。換了外匯作什麼？還戰債或充軍備。</p>
<p>假如各國把耗於軍事的科學硏究之費，改用於農業，農業生產必大增，而民食無虞。然而不，軍事第一，原子彈第一。人太多了糧食不足嗎？好，丟幾個原子彈死掉幾百千萬人，糧食問題就解決了—就是解決一半也好？</p>
<p>還有一個辦法，少點「添丁之喜」。然而不行，希特勒曾鼓勵德國人多生兒子，你以爲是法西斯主義該打倒？且慢。英國是最民主的，却是用盡方法，獎勵多子多孫，政府，團體，私人，都用盡全力促人生兒育女。英國的民主也許是老民主或偽民主，那麼新民主眞民主的蘇聯又何如？聽說中國的送子觀音在蘇聯已有徒黨了。</p>
<p>有計劃的减少糧食生產，又有計劃的多子多孫；就是有計劃的使人民枵腹奉公。這一點中國較進步：一切聽天由命。四五千年了，倒也一點不出毛病。善哉，善哉！</p>
<h3>游採花徑</h3>
<p>— 姚鵷雛</p>
<p>松江北郭採花徑石家莊，居民多藝竹，連畦接麗，無慮數千萬竿，蒙密蓊　，自外視之，徑路殆絕。漸卽其下，披蒿棘，踐落葉，數轉而後，豁然開朗，瓦舍竹籬，　牆瓷牖，隱見蒼霾中，陂塘放鴨，欄柵歸牛，童稚婦嫗，咸若有以自樂。夫武陵世外，本孤憤之寓言；巢由深山，非今世所宜有。若斯地者，密遍城市，旁通車轂，特游者偶未至爾，遂無足言。然其水本明瑟，田鷹幽邃，秋氣淸爽，笻屐相羊其間，亦未始不足供流通也。用紀小詩，以表其勝。</p>
<p>日色不到處，村　時有聲，路窮谿漲碧，竹合橫籬橫；避地殊非計，勞生各有營，還蔣運雙意，勃翠試閑行。</p>
<h3>泳鴣先生硯次叔範韻</h3>
<p>— 黃雲眉</p>
<p>吾頭可斷志不奪，鷓鴣奇行號突兀，白雲莊上燈火熒，萬死邊緣慶復活。從此身爲無土蘭，獨往獨來非故山。山中荒荒白日白，抵死猶漱鄰鄰石，窮市賣藝帽簷低，誰識包身肝膽赤？可憐帝王隨飛花，先生遺物出海涯，石函文字埋寒熖，失彼得此增咨嗟。米　能評古好硯，曾謂斯硯是極選，百年泥澄汾河底，蛟龍護之停鬥戰。吁嗟乎，山寨遙遙接滃洲，君臣雨泣天風秋，往事如夢忍回頭！忍回頭，望故浦，胡馬又來牧吾土，革匱十重何須藏，會當草檄振義鼓！</p>
<h3>竸爭</h3>
<p>— 柳岸</p>
<p>范德弼是美國最大的富翁之一，此君曾經主持過紐約中央鐵路公司。另有一位對手高爾德，却主持了美國東部貼路公司。美國的鐵路事業本來都是民營的，自然競爭得非常劇烈。最初，從白法羅地方運牛到紐約時，每一車的運費需一百二十五元，范德弼爲了搶生意，就跌爲一百元。高爾德豈肯干休，跌爲七十五元，范德弼再跌，跌爲五十元。高爾德再來一手，跌爲二十五元。范德弼來了一個驚人之筆，從白法羅運牛到紐約，每一車廂的運費祗收運費一元！</p>
<p>高爾德吃不消了，全部生意都到了范德弼手裏。可是高爾德却另有一個妙計，他偸偷地就做起畜牧生意來，從白法羅買了大批的牛，就從范德弼主持的貼路上運到紐約來。因爲運費低廉，而紐約的牛價一向比白法羅高出不少，竟在這轉手之間賺回了一大票</p>
<h3>集藏種種</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>「有好都能累此身。」然人而無好，則又覺生活枯燥，精神無所寄托。於是有所謂集藏者，廣蒐博采，展玩摩挲，無非藉以蠲慮解愁，怡情適性而已，固亦未可厚非也。予卽喜集藏之一分子，專事搜求前賢及時人尺牘，積有千餘通，自以爲珍於黃金夷鈔，荊人笑予爲痴，不之顧也。據予所知，番禺葉遐庵藏明宣德爐，累累盈櫉架。龔瞻麓太史之陽羨紫砂壺，大都出於大彬曼生茂林仲芳名手，凡三百件，儲庋之富爲海內第一。又書師馮超然珍愛象牙小盒，終日玩之不去手，偶或觸之微損，必惋惜累日。或謂之曰，君若病，呻吟臥床數十日，此盒必不憶足下也。超然爲之莞爾。又袁勵準侍講，善書能畫，藏墨綦多，著有墨品，拓注至精審，不輕示人。畫佛名家錢化佛，嗜好與人逈異，耗數十年之心血，積聚香烟盒及火柴殻，不下數千種，稱爲香火因緣，偶出展覽，觀者粲然。又南社亡友黃晦聞，蓄硯二十六方，中有半月形者，本係馬夷初家物，有陳弢庵·朱疆邨·馬通伯·章太炎·楊昀谷·吳絅齋·諸貞壯·馬一浮等題，晦聞乞於夾初，夷初慨然贈之，及晦聞下世，遺物散佚，夷初向肆賈購得，居然珠還合浦，尤爲文壇佳話。又吳湖帆藏有淸二百數十年來之狀元書扇，積成巨帙。又常州莊通百見書畫潤例輒檢存之，蔚爲大觀。又伏誅之今傳是樓主王揖唐，藏古琴數十張，玉軫金徽，頗多佳品，今不知流落何處矣，惜哉。</p>
<h3>海上</h3>
<p>— 陳烟帆</p>
<p>一艘駛向某一商埠的海船離開了上海。</p>
<p>那是淸晨八時，浦江兩岸的高厦漸漸的後移了。早晨的風是凉快的，江面的水彼鄰鄰翻動，漸潮可以望見浦東蒙着烟務的綠綠的田野。</p>
<p>可是這裏載着似乎都沒有愉快心情的一船旅客。一是昨夜上船，雖則未開，也一夜未得好睡，二是船小，大多數都買着三等票，並無睡處。船齡又老，又不淸潔。艙而走道又窄小。沒有辦法，祗得在甲板上找個空處，四邊兜着毯子，舖下席子被窩便睡，這樣不免要侵及或妨害到別人同樣的睡處，又有另一些人被侵及或妨害。同時還要愁烟囱裏大量的煤灰飄下來，或是晚上忽然下雨。</p>
<p>過不很久，有兩個旅客在下面後艙的蓬帳底下吵了起來。他們之中好像一個是婦女，一個是男人。大概是不相識的，一個女人呶呶不休，男的因此很惱怒。這種吵架不久便自然的平息了。但是這一天之內竟然還有三起。比較大的一起是一個軍人和一個壯年男子，他們大聲的吵着爭着駡着，幾乎要動手幹起來。我在一個比較安全的地方躺着，聽着。歸納起來可以得到一個槪念，多數的爭吵都是毫無必要。（一）他們之中必有一個是傲慢無理出言粗俗的人，或者由於一句不經意的話被對方所聽錯了。（二）必定是有一方面沒有替另一人着想，換句話說是爲自已算計得太週到了。（三）由於一種不能安靜和浮燥的心情，常常和人爭吵的人他一定不能在空閒的時候去作有益之思索。環境不滿意，煩燥而有空閒，猶如把許多野獸關在一個狭窄的籠裏也會互咬起來那樣，有時人的鬧得無理和無益彷彿也是那種情景。</p>
<p>一整天一整夜的大風浪。</p>
<p>一船的人，嘔吐過或沒有嘔吐過的人，無論是瞧都安安靜靜的睡着了。想想也好笑，這時誰都不生氣，也誰都不想鬧了。沒有人想吃飯吃茶，連走路的人也沒有。</p>
<p>又回復到風平浪靜的境地。船舷旁有二個人坐着，那人問另一個人道：「昨夜風浪的滋味還記得嗎？」旁坐的人說：「眞的，風浪一平，人立刻像從夢中醒來那麼新鮮。昨夜風浪大到什麼樣子？躺着多麼難過？似乎完全記不起來了。」這句話眞是很有意思的，從此可以推想人們對於苦難這一件事的記憶力的薄弱。奴隸脫籍立刻忘却他的非人生活，窮人暴發馬上不憶他的凍餒日子。洪水一過頓然沒有了災害的印象，戰爭一過很快消失了身受的悽慘和苦難的回憶。人們的記憶有時在不必要的事情上倒像生了根似的。例如莫泊桑小說裏馬丹拔蒂斯脫一篇，那個善良的婦人爲了不是她自身的過失一生受旁人的輕視，以至爲此而死。那婦人在做孩子時被男僕所汚，因此孩子們不和她同玩，大人也不和她親近，甚至結婚以後人們還不饒恕她，讓她悽慘地死去。這裏面上帝好像有一個神秘的安排，我不知這爲什麽如此。</p>

<h3>President Arrived in Tianjin from Beiping Yesterday Afternoon, Commending the People of the North for Their Deep Understanding of Righteousness, and Inspected Xingang Port in Tanggu Once, Du Yuming Flew to Xuzhou, Zhou Zhirou and Guo Qian Returned to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 5th] President Chiang arrived in Tianjin by special plane from Beiping at 11:30 am on the 5th. Chiefs from various departments and the Construction Society, including Chen Changjie, went to the airport to welcome him. After disembarking, the President, accompanied by Mayor Du and Commander Chen, took a car along the Tianjin-Tanggu highway to inspect Xingang Port. He returned to Tianjin at around 4:00 pm and went to his residence to rest, not receiving any guests, only giving instructions to the heads of the Party, government, and military.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Gold Control Bureau, told reporters on the 5th that he had reported to the President yesterday, detailing the financial dynamics of Beiping and Tianjin after the currency reform. The President repeatedly said: The people of the North deeply understand righteousness, and their performance is good. He instructed him to strengthen publicity on the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency, strictly investigate the black market, pay attention to the floating capital in the Northeast, and diligently investigate and report on major accounts remitting money into the customs, so as to investigate and deal with them. Shi said: The floating capital in Beiping and Tianjin can be said to be gradually moving onto the right track, as can be seen from the tenfold increase in deposits and the sevenfold to eightfold increase in loans after the currency reform.

<h3>Liu Zhe and Others Propose in the Supervisory Yuan to Rescue Northeast Grain, Propose Measures to Investigate Past Deceptions, Resolved to Proceed in Parallel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The "Proposal to Urgently Alleviate the Suffering and Save People from Danger by Seeking Ways to Provide Relief to Value People's Lives" proposed by Liu Zhe, Deputy Director of the Supervisory Yuan, and nine others regarding the Northeast grain issue was discussed at a meeting of the Supervisory Yuan at 3:00 pm on the 5th, and it was resolved to proceed in parallel. The first item of the measures listed in the original proposal will be handed over to the Finance and Food Committee and the Transportation Committee to study and decide whether to approve it. The second to fourth items will be handed over to the Northeast Administrative Office to conduct a thorough investigation and decide on handling, and the Director of the Yuan will invite Food Minister Guan Jiyu to the Director's residence at 9:00 pm on the 5th to exchange views on grain transportation issues with the Supervisory Commissioners from the Northeast. All Supervisory Commissioners familiar with this case can sign their names immediately and jointly send a telegram to the President, requesting the relevant personnel to handle it quickly to save lives. Liu et al.'s original proposal stated: "It is believed that the lack of grain in the Northeast and the starvation on the roads have reached the point where people are eating each other. The tragic situation is difficult to describe in writing. Recently, a telegram was received from Changchun stating that more than 100,000 people have starved to death in the area between the Nationalists and Communists. If relief is not urgently provided, the number of deaths due to starvation will increase daily. We must not only seek solutions urgently but also investigate past deceptions. The proposed measures are listed below, along with the circumstances of past deceptions: (1) Investigate the purchase of southern grain by the Northeast Regulation Bureau, which is still stored in Tianjin, Huludao, and other places. Ascertain the amount in storage and urgently transport it by air to save lives. (2) Former Director Chen Cheng felt as early as the 36th year that the people's food supply was insufficient, so he established a grain purchasing organization and allocated purchasing funds of up to more than 50 billion circulation tickets (at that time, one US dollar was equal to 3,350 national currency). It can be said that he foresaw the matter. However, after many days, no grain was purchased, and inflation worsened daily. It is rumored that someone used this money to earn interest. Director Chen once reprimanded them in person. Please provide a detailed statement on whether this is the case. (3) The issue of the Minsheng Farm: We do not know who runs the Minsheng Farm. This farm was left by the Japanese invaders. When acquiring this farm, they reported more acreage than they actually had, doing their best to deceive. They also fraudulently claimed agricultural implements and seeds provided by the United States to the Northeast and secretly sold 40 tons of American wheat seeds. The farm claimed more than 10 tons but did not plant a single grain, selling all of it and pocketing the money, causing the Relief Administration to be unwilling to provide more supplies to the Northeast, greatly affecting international opinion. (4) The Northeast Materials Regulation Bureau entrusted various merchants to handle the relief food for the Northeast, but it is rumored that someone used the name of a merchant to claim funds, did not make any purchases, and transported out more than 10,000 bags of flour, earning a profit of 15 billion yuan, which is very strange. Based on the above points, we intend to send a document to the Executive Yuan to quickly devise a plan for air transportation of grain and, at the same time, instruct the Supervisory Commissioners in the Northeast to conduct a thorough investigation and then file an impeachment, so that the number of corrupt officials and starving people can be reduced at the same time, then our hearts can be slightly at ease."</p>

<h3>To Prevent Communism, It Must Be Advanced in Both Asia and Europe</h3>
<p>Chen Lifu Meets with Foreign Reporters and States</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] Chen Lifu, Deputy Director of the Legislative Yuan, who recently returned from a visit to Europe and the United States, told United Press reporters on the 5th that if communism cannot be prevented in Asia, especially in China, the Marshall Plan will be a failure. He said: The "Europe First" regional strategy in World War II is clearly no longer applicable today. In the past, the Allied goals were Germany and Japan, which could be handled separately, but today the Western democratic countries are rising up to confront the unified center of communism. Chen said: "If the United States only implements the Marshall Plan in the West and does not provide similar assistance to the East at the same time, communism will accelerate its development in Asia. Therefore, we must prevent the spread of communism on both fronts simultaneously, and an Asian Marshall Plan would be a wise move." Chen's remarks were made after the Central News Agency reported that the United States was considering an Asian Marshall Plan, and they are generally seen as a preliminary official Chinese response to the US House Appropriations Committee's urging to step up aid to China.</p>

In the past, the income from Shanghai's commodity tax accounted for about 58% to 62% of the total commodity tax. It is now difficult to predict whether the income from Shanghai's commodity tax can still reach the above ratio, as the budget for commodity tax has increased more than fourfold compared to the original budget. The original budget for total commodity tax income was more than 34.013 million gold yuan, which has now been increased to more than 163.11 million gold yuan. To achieve the budget figures, it is necessary to strengthen supervision of taxation. It is currently the peak month for tax revenue.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 5th] Changchun has been experiencing dreary winds and cold rain for days, and the temperature has become even lower.

Most of the defending troops have changed into winter clothing airdropped; in the past ten days, more citizens have gone south.

Horse and mule meat and bran noodles are the main items for sale. A month ago, there were rows of people selling tattered clothing along the streets, but now they are no longer visible. After the cessation of inland remittances, some citizens did not dare to go south lightly because they had nowhere to turn in the interior, and they were extremely depressed.

<h3>Preventing National Enterprises from Raising Prices: The Legislative Yuan Schedules a Formal Discussion for the 8th, and Inquiries to the Executive Yuan Regarding Disaster Relief and Tax Reduction Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The eighth session of the second term of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 5th, chaired by President Sun. After the meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan first reported on collected materials concerning news reports that had revealed secrets of the Yuan. Following this, the reported matters were handled, the minutes of the seventh session were approved, and it was resolved to submit the Executive Yuan's submitted proposals for review. The draft proposal for the general budget review procedure, which was temporarily put forward by the Budget Committee, was returned for review after substantial revisions. Then, the discussion items began. The first case was Qian Nashui's proposal to relieve the victims of floods in various provinces and reduce taxes in disaster areas. It was resolved to submit an inquiry to the Executive Yuan, requesting a response regarding the relief measures adopted for each disaster area. The second case was Zhao Erkang's proposal to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the salt affairs authorities to allocate special funds from the salt field construction fees increased with taxes to maintain and develop the welfare of salt workers. It was also resolved to submit an inquiry to the Executive Yuan, requesting a response regarding what kind of subsidies were provided for the welfare of the workers after the cancellation of the salt worker welfare subsidy fee attached to the salt tax to prevent its stagnation. The third case was Jin Shaoxian's proposal to request the Executive Yuan to instruct various ministries to submit periodic reports on the implementation of policies to the Legislative Yuan.

The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] More than fifty members of the Legislative Yuan, jointly conspired, and proposed an emergency temporary motion in the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 5th: "Immediately Request the Executive Yuan to Stop National Enterprises from Raising Prices," believing that the government has promulgated an emergency financial and economic decree, freezing prices, and has severely sanctioned merchants who destroy the price limit. Most merchants can still abide by the laws, but the Executive Yuan's political meeting actually discussed the case of state-owned professional price increases, which is the same as leading the price increase, and it is no different from destroying the laws and losing the trust of the people. If state-owned enterprises increase prices, private enterprises can take the opportunity to increase prices. The dangerous situation of soaring prices will surely develop, affecting the value of gold yuan notes. Then this currency system reform will inevitably fail. Therefore, it is advocated that when the emergency financial and economic decree is strictly implemented and prices have not yet stabilized, state-owned enterprises must not increase prices for any reason, and three measures are proposed: (1) If the revenue and expenditure of state-owned enterprises cannot be balanced, personnel should be laid off and downsized immediately. (2) The adjustment of prices of state-owned enterprises should first complete the legislative procedures. (3) Stop the immediate proposed price increase of state-owned enterprises to avoid stimulating public sentiment and affecting the monetary system. After this case was proposed at the end of the meeting on the 5th, the committees believed that the matter was important and resolved to include it in the agenda of the ninth meeting on the 8th for formal discussion.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Kurusu Incident and the Crisis of the Ashida Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Japanese Ashida Cabinet, which appeared in the form of the former Katayama Cabinet's "old store newly opened" on March 10 of this year, has been in power for seven months. During these more than half a year, the Ashida Cabinet has experienced hardships. The huge budget案 for this year, the Nishio Vice Minister's bribery案, and the labor潮 and civil servant怠工潮, followed one after another, causing the Cabinet to be overwhelmed. After Ashida運甲 used his flexible skills to deal with this series of storms, he was holding great hope for the future of "centrist politics" when the Showa Electric Industrial Large-Scale Fraud案 suddenly broke out again. Kurusu Takeo, Minister of the Cabinet Economic Stabilization Headquarters, was arrested by the Tokyo Prosecutor's Office on September 30, and there was talk of summoning Ashida. This疑獄 incident involved many people. Under the accusations of public opinion, the Cabinet was surrounded by crises, and the opposition took the opportunity to force Ashida Cabinet to resign completely. The original alliance of the three parties also showed a split due to the疑獄 incident: The special議會, which was originally delayed, had to be announced to be held on October 11. Although the Democratic Party and Ashida's能度 expressed considerable strength and were not afraid of the new offensive launched by the opposition due to the Kurusu incident, the decline in the government's reputation and the separation of the government and the party were inevitable. The fate of the Ashida Cabinet is tied to a few changes between旦夕.</p>
<p>The Kurusu incident is a political poverty 汚案. From the perspective of Japanese politics, it is a serious situation. It not only constitutes Kurusu's personal disgrace but also constitutes the disgrace of the Democratic Party and the current regime. Regardless of the severity of Kurusu's criminal responsibility, Prime Minister Ashida and the Cabinet should角 considerable administrative responsibility. According to the "Tokyo Shimbun" on October 1, the truth of the案 is that when the Ashida Hitoshi Cabinet was formed at the beginning of this year, in order to combat the opposition party and争取 a majority for the ruling party, a large amount of money was spent. Ashida may be responsible for executing this money, and the Governor of the Bank of Japan一萬田尙登 and the Minister of Health and Welfare武田儀一 were both involved in this案. Kurusu attracted this money, and it was found that it came from Showa Electric Industrial會　. President Hino原 has already admitted to the court that the donation did happen. In order to conduct偵察 and審訊, in addition to arresting Kurusu and his secretary Sanmoto Tsunehiko (former secretary-general of the興業 Bank), the court also搜査 the residences of一萬田 and 武田. The police局 has also ordered the便拘捕. Obviously, this political corruption案 is very serious, much more serious than the Nishio incident! Nishio accepted "political donations" from the "Civil Engineering Construction Industry Association," amounting to only馮 500,000 yen. Kurusu accepted donations from "Showa Electric Industrial會社," and the amount was even larger, and there was suspicion of using his authority. This incident has long constituted an open secret in Japanese politics. Now that it has been revealed and become a tool for political struggle, it is not only to drag down the Ashida Cabinet but also to fade Ashida from the鲜艷 political flower bud. Therefore, it is said that the occurrence of the Kurusu incident has a very significant影饗 on Ashida's fate.</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration, Japanese political parties have not established a solid foundation. The so-called political parties representing class interests do not take root in the masses but grow on the shoulders of the royal family or the military閥財閥. The political綱政策 is from top to bottom, and the political funds are also from top to bottom.　弊 is inevitable and has deepened generation by generation. Regarding the abuses in the general election last April, there was the revelation of the Nishio bribery incident in the Socialist Party, and now there is the 검 of the Kurusu bribery incident. Although the former has already been实吿无罪 by the court, it is not yet known how the latter案 will be sentenced, but the serious situation is difficult to completely cover up these open secrets. "The Liberal國民" magazine published in Tokyo on June 10 this year published a behind-the-scenes expose of Japanese politics. The round table record revealed the inside stories of various political parties and the secrets of the Tod田内閣 without遗. The magazine criticized the Ashida Cabinet as a "渣子 Cabinet" and also called it the "Showa Electric Industrial Cabinet." The so-called 渣子 refers to the fact that a third party with less than 100议员 obtained the premiership, which is unreasonable for democratic politics: The so-called "Showa Electric Industrial Cabinet" means that Showa Electric Industrial會社 gave the Democratic Party a large number of "political donations" in connection with the loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Showa Electric Industrial once said to the Democratic Party: As long as they can support Ashida, they can take out 8 million to 10 million yen. It is said outside that the amount of Showa Electric Industrial's donation is hundreds of millions of yen, of which 50 to 60 million yen is for the "understanding fee" of various political parties. The remaining 50 to 60 million yen is the cost of buying off议员 from the nomination of Ashida to the completion of the Ashida cabinet. This huge sum of money was passed through Kurusu's户. Kurusu obtained the position of Minister of the Economic Stabilization Headquarters because of this transaction. Kurusu was originally from the Democratic Party. His relationship with Inukai健 Ashida Hitoshi was not deep, and his reputation in Japanese political party relations was not隆. He climbed to a high position due to this disgraceful cause, in charge of the economic recovery plan of defeated Japan, and took the會党's "carefully structured" "五年　与计划草案" as his own. Kurusu naturally could not avoid falling交. However, this time, the fall was too great, and the incompetence and greed of Japanese bureaucratic politics were ruthlessly exposed.</p>
<p>The Kurusu incident constitutes a crisis for the Ashida Cabinet, which is undoubtedly true. But will the Ashida Cabinet collapse because of this? First, it depends on how Ashida handles the "Prohibition of Civil Servant Strike Law" during the period of this special議會. This can be measured. In general, it is good or bad for the current regime. Secondly, it depends on how the Democratic Party resists the Democratic Liberal Party and strives for</p>
<p>The Unity of the Association and the Two Parties to Overcome This Difficulty. The 수정起草 of the "Prohibition of Civil Servant Strike Law" was MacArthur's letter to Ashida　理 on July 22. The Ashida Cabinet issued a政令 on August 1 based on this调示, and made factual revisions to the "National Public Service Law," prohibiting civil servants from striking and any "labor offensive." The main month of the convening of this special会？ is to legalize and rationalize this temporary emergency measure. If the議会 does not pass it, MacArthur will not be happy. Today, no Japanese political party resists the Allied Headquarters. Therefore, Ashida may use this案 as a护身符 to delay the life of the current regime. The Allied Headquarters is quite concerned about the "Prohibition of Civil Servant Strike Law" and has not made any statement on the Kurusu incident. Ashida made a special trip to visit the Allied Headquarters for this matter. From the Democratic Party's firm statement that the Cabinet will never resign, it seems that the Allied Headquarters does not want to expand the situation of the案. Therefore, the Democratic Party has become stronger. As for the opposition party, needless to say, the Democratic Liberal Party wants to oppose the government and demand a general election. The status of the first party has been firmly established. The Socialist Party, the government and the party, has a very崛態度 towards the Kurusu incident this time.</p>
<p>The 左右派 of the 會　 both advocate the total resignation of the Cabinet, and say that even if the next regime falls into the hands of the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party, they will not care, because the occurrence of the Kurusu incident in the Ashida Cabinet is really 无颜 to face the people of the country." Their explicit determination to overthrow the cabinet is evident on paper. The Socialist Party's hard words about the Kurusu incident have the effect of retaliating against Ashida's improper handling of the Nishio incident. The Ashida Cabinet was produced with the support of the Socialist Party.　Ashida Nishio's private affair is solved by the person who tied the bell. If the air of the Socialist Party's倒閣 is truly firm,　　Ashida's one-man effort is difficult to stand　的.</p>
<p>The government　一 and the party國民協同黨 have also expressed the view that the Cabinet must resign completely. Seeing the situation, the Ashida Cabinet is isolated and helpless. Unless the Allied Headquarters firmly supports it, or Yoshida of the Liberal Party suddenly turns to cooperate with Ashida, the current regime will have a hard time surviving today's dangerous境.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing the Domestic Situation and Hoping to Obtain More US Aid: 500 Million US Dollars Needed Annually to Balance the Budget, Stated by the Minister of Land and Finance at a Press Conference in Washington</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Chinese Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu stated at a press conference on the 4th that he hoped to obtain more US aid to stabilize the economic and political situation in China. Wang continued, "I am extremely burdensome for the progress of the currency system reform implemented on August 19, "We hope to receive foreign aid in the next year and beyond, and at the same time we are trying our best and hope to show that we are determined to help ourselves." Wang also stated that in the current stage of adopting a defensive posture against the共 Party in North China, there is a deficit of 30 percent in the annual budget, about 300 million US dollars, part of which is covered by issuing government bonds. He pointed out that if the government takes an offensive posture, the fiscal deficit will be even greater unless foreign aid is received. Wang estimated that in order to eliminate the共 Party and recover lost land, China will need 500 million US dollars annually in the next two or three years to balance the budget.</p>
<p>Minister Wang said that he hoped that the United States would provide assistance, but pointed out that China would prefer to obtain supplies rather than cash. "The sooner China obtains supplies, the sooner the Chinese共 Party will fail." Under the 125 million US dollar military assistance plan, China has only received "some transport aircraft" to date. When asked whether the CCP had received any foreign aid, Wang replied, "I am not sure, but I am sure they must have received some aid."</p>
<p>Wang answered questions that the prospects for China's recovery of trade and trade were improving, and that some barter trade had been concluded. Wang continued that he and other officials in the Far East were studying "the possibility of organizing an Asian alliance for economic and political security in accordance with the nature of the Western European Union. But it is aimed at obtaining assistance from the United States similar to the援　計劃. He continued that the details had not yet been decided, and the negotiations were still in the exploratory stage.</p>
<p>Wang said that the Chinese government is determined to maintain the currency system reform for the efficiency of balancing the budget and repaying foreign exchange, and is working hard to迷到 this goal. The Chinese people have responded well to this, and the results so far have been "very satisfactory." Wang Yunwu continued: "I can guarantee that the government has the determination to improve the situation." Wang listed the measures taken as: First, reviewing the old tax system; second, adopting new measures to effectively increase government revenue; One hundred and eleven, strictly saving government expenditures, and abolishing redundant personnel. "When prices stabilize and people's beliefs are restored, the situation can be improved." When asked whether he had read the report of the House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee on the activities of the共 Party in China, Wang replied that he had not had time to study the report, but that the report put forward a very accurate analysis, and he strongly agreed with the report's advocacy of strengthening aid to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu arrived here in Washington today and will stay for two days before returning to China. Several receptions have been prepared. He is scheduled to speak at the American Far East Industrial and Commercial Committee on the 6th, and will also meet with some financial leaders here. He will return to China by plane from San Francisco on the 7th.</p>

<h3>Curbing Panic Buying in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Hangzhou: Strict Investigation of Scalpers; Citizens of Yangzhou and Changshu Also Rush to Buy Goods; Beijing Implements Rationing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 5th] Yesterday, due to scalpers from Shanghai coming to Suzhou to snap up goods, citizens became anxious and rushed to buy. The county government ordered the police to strictly investigate scalpers and immediately organized an inspection team to be stationed in central areas inside and outside the city to monitor street activity and prevent disturbances.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Office, 5th] Here, prices of all goods have risen to the 819 limit. The rush to buy in yarn shops in the Beidajie Jiangyin Lane area is particularly intense. To prevent scalpers, yarn businesses have established a temporary joint cotton yarn allocation office, effective immediately. The flour market has also stalled, with flour shops overcrowded with people queuing and jostling to buy, creating a seriously chaotic situation. Furthermore, jewelry stores have been closed for a long time and are unable to maintain operations, leading to the dismissal of staff. Fresh meat is available at a price but out of stock, while cooked meat remains available. At 9 AM today, the county government, together with the command post, formed a team to discuss the issue of increased taxes on tobacco and alcohol, deciding to sell alcohol and tobacco at the original price plus increased tax, and cigarettes at Shanghai prices.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 5th] Panic buying in Hangzhou is even more intense, with scalpers actively buying up woolen yarn and silk fabrics, causing these two industries to be in a state of near-standstill. Department stores are also hoarding goods and refusing to sell. Because the Hangzhou Yarn Factory allocates yarn at prices much lower than the black market, scalpers are even more rampant. Recognizing the market chaos, the inspection authorities conducted a full inspection on the 5th and detained scalpers.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Office, 5th] After the adjustment of the cigarette tax, panic buying became intense due to the uncertainty of the new prices. Today, the county government, in order to prevent the expansion of the panic buying trend, ordered managers of stores to temporarily suspend business from noon to register their cigarette inventory within half a day. Simultaneously, the city defense department and pacification teams were invited to jointly verify the new prices for stored cigarettes, generally doubling the prices of all brands of cigarettes, to be sold at the new prices starting tomorrow. In addition, citizens have been rushing to buy cloth and general merchandise in recent days, with most shops closing as early as 6 PM, resulting in an unprecedentedly desolate evening market. The rice market is experiencing low trading volume due to limited supply. However, the market outside the city has become chaotic, and the authorities have increased their vigilance.</p>
<p>[Our Changshu Office, 5th] Due to uncertain supplies of silk fabrics, general merchandise, imported goods, and local products, residents are rushing to buy them, making it impossible for businesses to cope. They closed early today to avoid the rush. The market situation is gradually becoming chaotic, but fortunately, the authorities are maintaining order effectively, and no accidents have occurred.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] There has been panic buying in Beijing on the 5th. To prevent this, the municipal authorities have stipulated that, starting from the 6th, citizens purchasing (1) cotton cloth, (2) wool fabrics, (3) woolen yarn, (4) flour, and (5) rubber shoes must present their national identification cards, and there will be certain quantity limits.

<h3>Security Council Passes Resolution to Include Berlin Issue on Agenda: Soviet Representative Announces Non-Participation in Discussions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris Radio, 5th: The Security Council today, with nine votes to two, passed a resolution to discuss the Berlin issue. After the resolution was passed, Soviet representative Vyshinsky immediately requested to speak, stating that the Soviet Union would withdraw from this discussion. The Ukrainian representative expressed solidarity with the Soviet Union. Both representatives left the venue only after the chairman announced that the discussion would be postponed until tomorrow. Vyshinsky firmly denied that the Soviet Union had blockaded Berlin, saying that this was extreme propaganda and completely unfounded. He also accused the United Kingdom, the United States, and France of attempting to sabotage the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference. He believed that the Berlin issue should be discussed by the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in order to reach a peaceful solution. The Soviet representative stated that the Soviet Union absolutely supported the United Nations, but that the United Nations should currently focus on issues such as Indonesia, Palestine, and Greece, and hand over the Berlin issue to the Foreign Ministers Conference, as this issue was not within the scope of the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] According to well-informed sources here today, any mediation of the Berlin dispute by international figures such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations or Australian Foreign Minister Evatt is premature. At the same time, sources close to the Secretary-General of the United Nations confirmed that both Lie and Evatt would not want to lose the opportunity to intervene unless it was proven that such action would be effective. However, as of now, the development of the situation does not allow for the possibility of such an opportunity. According to Lie's opinion, the current consultation could be used for the future to facilitate the road to compromise between East and West. However, Lie believes that any initiation of mediation should come from the majority of delegations from the outside, especially the British delegation, who believe that this proposal can only be put forward when the situation becomes a real threat to peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] Although Vyshinsky hinted on the 4th that the Soviet Union would refuse to participate in any debate on the Berlin issue, Western representatives believe that this is just another bluff by the Soviet Union. A spokesman for the US delegation said, "We don't think they will walk out. The Soviet Union has been in the habit of intimidation and threats after the war, but intimidation and threats can never be the basis of policy."</p>
<h3>International Control of Atomic Energy Issue: Two Groups Engage in Verbal Warfare; Czechoslovakia Expresses Unwillingness for Uranium Mines to Be Controlled</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] The United Nations Political Committee continued the atomic energy debate on the 5th. Canadian representative McNaughton challenged the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union seemed to have declared its willingness to accept the United States' atomic energy control plan as a basis for future discussions. He asked the Soviet Union to guarantee its promise. Czech representative Clementis condemned the U.S. plan as representing the saying of "atomic energy in common ownership", supporting the Soviet Union and calling on the West not to block the way to a solution. He mentioned the Czech uranium mine but said it was not important.</p>
<p>Australian representative Hodgson described the U.S. contribution to atomic energy as "epoch-making and unique", but opposed the Canadian proposal to temporarily end the United Nations' discussions with the Soviet Union on atomic energy control, which had been supported by the three powers. He said, "We must not give up any chance of reaching an agreement, because the consequences of failure would be truly appalling for mankind." The El Salvadoran representative attacked the Soviet Union for implying that it might possess atomic bombs, stating affirmatively that "she will not possess atomic weapons." The Belarusian representative Kyrylaǔ accused the U.S. of adopting a "big stick policy", saying that the so-called monopoly of atomic energy was "the biggest stick." Clementis declared that Czechoslovakia was unwilling to place its uranium mines under international control. His statement was quite important, as Czechoslovakia was the only uranium-producing country within the Soviet sphere of influence. He said that Czechoslovakia opposed international control of atomic energy development because "we have uranium mines, and under this plan, we must give up the uranium mines and hand them over to international institutions." Since 1945, the Soviet Union has controlled Czech mineral resources, prohibiting Czechs from operating mines under monopolistic lease agreements. Philippine representative Romulo said that the Soviet Union's new atomic energy proposal, if its meaning is as we understand it, is a ray of hope. He said that only the U.S. possessed atomic bombs in the world.</p>
<h3>"Strange" Explosion Occurs in the Soviet Union: Suspected to Be Atomic Test</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] The seismograph at the Zurich Meteorological Station in Switzerland indicated a "strange" explosion somewhere in Russia, which may have been caused by an atomic test. U.S. scientists are paying close attention to this matter. It is heard that several U.S. laboratories have also recorded the same tremor. U.S. seismologists will hold a scheduled conference on Thursday, at which time they will study whether the tremor was atomic or caused by ordinary large amounts of explosives.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Devotes Efforts to Atomic Research</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 4th that Soviet physicist Vavilov had recently completed luminescent research in Leningrad that would help atomic research. In his new book, Vavilov pointed out that cold light or luminescence "has become a fundamental part of physics and an inseparable part of the structure theories of atoms, molecules, crystals, and liquids, which is helpful to the study of material structure by physicists and chemists, and its practical use has also greatly increased."</p>

<h3>Wartime Air Raid Shelters: Britain Stops Demolition</h3>
<p>Recruitment Rally Disrupted by Communists</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The Home Office confirmed today that the British government has ordered local civil defense bureaus to stop demolishing air raid shelters. According to well-informed sources, emergency water pools set up in villages during the war have also been ordered to stop dismantling. It is also said that the government is considering plans to build deep air raid shelters in various places.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] Communist demonstrators attempted to disrupt armed forces recruitment rallies in London and Croydon on the 4th, but were dispersed by military police. At an outdoor rally in London, two people climbed onto the stage while Secretary of Defense Alexander was speaking, holding banners that read "Don't Fight for U.S. Dollars." They and ten others were arrested by the police. Although there were conflicts during the rally, there were no injuries.</p>
<h3>Governments of Five Western European Countries Officially Announce: Montgomery Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces; Commanders of Land, Air, and Naval Forces Appointed by British and French Generals Respectively; Agreement Reached on U.S. and Canada Participating in Joint Defense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] It is heard that after a two-hour meeting of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France here on the afternoon of the 5th, a major decision has been made on the expansion of the Western European alliance defense plan to the Atlantic alliance, so that the United States and Canada can jointly participate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th] The governments of the five Western European countries participating in the Brussels Treaty announced here last night the official candidates for the Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Forces. As expected, Marshal Montgomery has been appointed as the permanent Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Forces.</p>
<p>French General Tassigny has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Land Forces, British Air Marshal Robb has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Allied Air Forces, and French Vice Admiral Chassaigne has been appointed Commander of the Western European Allied Naval Forces. It is noteworthy that the Naval Commander of the Western European Allied Forces does not use the title "Commander-in-Chief", as it is generally known that once a war breaks out, the British Navy will fight under the command of its national commander. Therefore, the Naval Commander of the Western European Allied Forces is actually only an advisor to the Western European Alliance. It is said that Marshal Montgomery is currently the Chief of Staff of the British Empire, and will resign from his current position when he takes up his new position. General Tassigny is currently the Inspector General of the French Army, Marshal Robb is currently the Commander-in-Chief of the British Air Force Fighter Command, and General Chassaigne is the Deputy Chief of Staff of the French Navy.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London Radio, 5th: Marshal Montgomery will resign from his position as Chief of Staff of the British Empire. The highest-ranking candidate to succeed him is Clutterbuck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] French Vice Admiral Chassaigne has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western European Navy, which has been well received by all sectors of the British Navy, as the main task of this position is to adjust the naval defenses of the European coastline, and France occupies most of the coastline. Naval circles also pointed out that Chassaigne will be known as the "Representative of the Western European Navy" and will focus on advising the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army and Air Force, and his staff is expected to include senior naval officers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The Chiefs of Staff of the Land, Sea, and Air Forces of the five signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty are scheduled to meet here tomorrow, with Lord Tedder, the British Air Force Chief of Staff, presiding.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy of Korea, Cho Pyong-ok, Visits Truman</h3>
<p>Hoping the U.S. Will Continue Military and Economic Aid</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, D.C., 4th] Cho Pyong-ok, special representative of Korean President Syngman Rhee, met with President Truman today. Afterwards, he told reporters that he expressed his gratitude to Mr. Truman for the United States' assistance in achieving Korea's independence. He also requested that the United States continue to be concerned about the well-being of Korea. Cho stated that the Korean people and their newly established democratically elected government in Seoul will continue to work toward the reunification of North and South Korea. However, he told Mr. Truman that Korea still needs military and economic aid to carry out its national plans.</p>
<h3>Berlin Air Corridor: Soviets Conduct Parachute Exercises; Britain Receives Notice and Protests</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 5th] Soviet officials notified the Allied Air Safety Center on the 5th that they would be conducting parachute exercises in the air corridor 20 miles outside of Berlin. Details were not released. The Soviets only stated that the parachute exercises would be held in the corridor, between two Soviet airfields 25 miles apart, right on the edge of the British sector of Berlin. The British immediately protested, arguing that this action violated safety agreements. The Soviets stated that the parachutists would begin descending from 2,600 feet, which would clearly endanger British aircraft, as British planes usually fly below 2,000 feet.</p>
<h3>U.S. Bipartisan Foreign Policy Remains Consistent; Will Not Abandon Rights in Berlin; Vandenberg Warns Soviets Against Miscalculation</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, D.C., 4th] Republican Senator Vandenberg, a senior planner of foreign policy, delivered a radio address last night, praising America's bipartisan foreign policy, pointing out that this policy allows the nation to speak with greater unity and enables foreign policy to remain consistent. He explained the process by which government policy becomes bipartisan policy and reiterated his warning that "any idea that we are divided by disagreements on domestic issues and therefore vulnerable is a mistake." He described the Republican Party's contributions to the European Recovery Program, the aid to Greece and Turkey agreement, and the Rio de Janeiro Treaty, stating, "I want to reiterate that this is the most brilliant demonstration of bipartisan foreign policy." In dealing with diplomatic problems, our unity is as important as our atomic bomb. This unity is currently our best guarantee of peace. We oppose easily abandoning our rights in Berlin in the face of Soviet aggression. Abandoning these rights, as in the Munich Conference, would have endless implications. We condemn the Soviets for their hypocrisy in rejecting our peaceful proposals to lift the Berlin blockade.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, D.C., 4th] In his radio address, Vandenberg condemned the Truman administration for not adhering to bipartisan foreign policy in its dealings with China and Japan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Strengthens Aid to France</h3>
<p>UNRRA Hastens its Closure</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 5th] According to Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Director Hoffman late on the 4th, the 45 billion francs allocated for France as part of U.S. aid will not be tied, as a preferential treatment for France. This sum will be used by France to purchase industrial equipment and rebuild merchant ships. Another 1.7 billion francs will be used for developing electricity. Hoffman continued, stating that whether or not to freeze the remaining half of the ECA's funds for France will depend on the progress of France's financial recovery and monetary stability.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, D.C., 4th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is currently hastening its closure. The council today approved a plan to immediately liquidate accounts and allocate unused assets to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The World Health Organization will receive one million U.S. dollars, which has already been allocated for the implementation of health programs and approved by the joint committee of the World Health Organization, so only a transfer on paper is needed. The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund will receive 11,679,500 dollars (non-U.S. currency, and mostly not convertible into U.S. dollars).</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes Spread in France</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] After 300,000 miners went on strike, causing the Queuille government a headache, it is reported that 200,000 civil servants across France stopped working today. However, the overall situation in the country remains calm on the surface. Rumors are circulating that a three-party coalition movement is underway in French political circles, allowing the Communist Party to rejoin the government. Some believe that this movement is the best way to prevent de Gaulle from coming to power. However, due to fears that this may adversely affect U.S. aid, even if such action is taken, its prospects are still fraught with obstacles.</p>
<h3>Burmese Insurgent Volunteers May Compromise with Government</h3>
<p>Will Accept Government's Peace Terms</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, 5th] London Radio, Rangoon: Official sources in Rangoon say it is expected that the insurgent White Band Volunteers will soon accept peace terms.

<h3>Sebald Promoted to Political Advisor to MacArthur</h3>

<h3>Soviets Designate Several Cities as Restricted Areas; Restrict Activities of U.S. Personnel; U.S. May Take Reciprocal Measures Against Soviet Diplomats</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 4th] The State Department announced today that the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union has received notification from the Soviet government that foreign journalists and foreign personnel are now prohibited from entering certain cities and regions of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 4th] A State Department spokesman commented on the Soviet government's new measures prohibiting foreign journalists and diplomats from entering certain areas, saying that this is equivalent to prohibiting foreigners from visiting the entire Soviet Union except for the 50-kilometer radius around Moscow. Moreover, some areas within this 50-kilometer radius have also been designated as restricted areas. In theory, foreign journalists and others can still visit places that are not designated as restricted areas, but in order to go to any city, they must pass through these restricted areas, so in reality, it is equivalent to prohibiting travel throughout the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, D.C., 5th] In light of the Soviet Union's increasing restrictions on American diplomats, the State Department is considering taking "reciprocal" measures against Soviet diplomats in the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 4th] The State Department announced that former U.S. Consul in Vladivostok, Lyon, has departed for home with his wife and three consular staff members.</p>

<h3>Hirohito's Visit to Newspaper Exhibition Causes Commotion</h3>
<p>Japanese Bow Deeply and Shout "Banzai"</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Emperor Hirohito, accompanied by the Empress, visited a newspaper exhibition at a department store here this morning. The scene was more chaotic than ever before. Photographers and newsreel cameramen followed closely behind the Emperor and Empress, blocking their path and shouting loudly, ordering everyone to stay in place and not to move to avoid interfering with the photography. Hirohito squeezed through the crowd with difficulty, turning around with trouble, and the Empress was sweating profusely. Her maid constantly tiptoed and raised her hand to wipe the sweat from her forehead. The photographers rushed forward, giving the Emperor no "room to breathe." One Japanese newspaper fearfully said: "His Majesty will probably lose four or five pounds today." After the tour, the Emperor and Empress walked down the gray stone steps in front of the company's gate. A Japanese man shouted "Banzai" in the middle of the street. The company's Japanese employees all bowed deeply. The solemn and respectful scene at that time was in stark contrast to the scene inside. The heads of the newspapers also bowed to the ground when the Emperor summoned them. Today, under the flashing lights and loud shouts, the facial muscles of the Japanese man trembled, as if he was shocked. The royal attendants initially told foreign journalists that they were not allowed to shake hands with the Emperor, but all the journalists shook hands with him when they saw him.</p>
<h3>Siamese Prince Injured in Car Accident</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lausanne, 5th] King Bhumibol of Thailand was injured in a car accident in the canton of Vaud in western Switzerland today.

<h3>To Alleviate the Military and Economic Crisis in Greece: U.S. Aid Has Achieved Results; Truman Submits Report to Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, D.C., 5th] President Truman reported to Congress on the 5th that the "remarkable success" of U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey has provided security for the Middle East and greatly benefited world peace. In the first optimistic report on the issue of aid to Greece and Turkey, the President said that U.S. aid was provided "at a historically critical time in the struggle for peace." He stated that U.S. aid to Greece supported the right of free people to choose their own government and laid the foundation for their economic recovery. "Although the Communist agitation, sabotage, and defamation campaigns have intensified, these goals have clearly been achieved." "The remarkable success of this program has enabled the Greek people to overcome the military and economic crisis they faced. At the same time, supporting Turkey's decision to resist foreign pressure and maintain its independence has contributed significantly to consolidating this strategic region and benefiting world peace." The President's report included an overview of the first year of work on the $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey program. He stated that U.S. aid has enabled Greece to "overcome the serious threat to its independence" and saved its economy from collapse.

<h3>Several Problems Remain in Aiding Western European Recovery</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, D.C., 4th] President Truman recently submitted a report on the work of the Marshall Plan from April to June of this year, stating, "The recovery work of Western European countries has made considerable progress, but if true economic stability is to be achieved, there are still several serious problems that need to be resolved." Truman's report concluded: During this period, the main task of the Economic Cooperation Administration was to strive to obtain consumer goods. In the future, attention should be paid to increasing Europe's export potential. Finally, the report emphasized that Marshall Plan recipient countries can purchase goods such as oil and meat from countries other than the United States and also stated that, as suggested by the House of Representatives, the dismantling of certain German factories should be halted.</p>

<h3>Premier Weng Cables Instructions to Inspector Chiang, Directing That No Taxes Be Added Except on Tobacco and Alcohol; Strictly Investigate Travelers' Limited Items for Export</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Premier Weng Wenhao personally made a long-distance phone call to Chiang Ching-kuo, who is in charge of commercial management in Shanghai, and gave two important instructions: (1) The central government has decided that except for items such as tobacco and alcohol that have already had taxes increased, no taxes will be added to any other items. (2) Starting today, outbound travelers in the city will be subject to increased inspection on land, sea, and air. The items carried will be limited to the necessities required by one person; any excess will be confiscated. The purpose of this measure is to prevent "single-band" smuggling of materials from the city. Furthermore, the management authorities believe that the current phenomenon of competitive purchasing of materials, although strictly restricted, does not hinder the overall situation. The spokesperson stated that as long as factories do not stop production and the supply of daily necessities is sufficient, the competitive purchasing of materials can be said to be an unnecessary worry. As for the rush to buy luxury goods, it is even more irrelevant to people's livelihood. Also, it is reported that Chiang Ching-kuo visited the Shenxin No. 9 Factory yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to conduct an on-site inspection and discuss the issue of raw material supply with the person in charge.</p>
<h3>Price of Foreign Cigarettes Approved to Increase; Temporarily Suspend Supply First; Handle Inventory Registration</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Bureau of Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian convened a meeting yesterday afternoon with representatives from the Bureau of Commodity Supply, the Bureau of Commodity Tax, the Bureau of Finance, and cigarette manufacturers to discuss the issue of adjusting the price of foreign cigarettes after the increase in commodity tax. It was decided to handle the registration of foreign cigarette inventory and issue a notice to the associations instructing all cigarette shops to temporarily suspend the sale of foreign cigarettes before the price of foreign cigarettes is determined. In principle, the price of foreign cigarettes is permitted to increase in proportion to the price of domestic cigarettes, pending detailed verification.</p>
<p>It is reported that merchants in the city have registered 58,644 cases of foreign cigarettes with the Bureau of Commodity Tax, with 50,000 cigarettes per case. In addition, scattered strips and cigarettes stored by the Bureau of Commodity Supply are not included. Therefore, although the import of foreign cigarettes has been prohibited, the inventory and smuggled goods</p>
<p>The original ratio of the price of Lis cigarettes to the price of the domestic cigarettes was three to one. Now that the commodity tax on domestic cigarettes has increased, the price ratio has dropped to one to one. Wu Kaixian believes that if the price of foreign cigarettes is not increased, the cigarette factories in the city will be forced to close down, which will indirectly affect government tax revenue. The problem is serious, so it was decided to increase the price of foreign cigarettes in proportion. In addition to handling the registration of inventory, the Bureau of Commodity Supply was also asked to inform the number of inventory. In the future, the price of the bureau's sale will also be increased.</p>
<p>Unlicensed Foreign Cigarettes Will Be Banned</p>
<p>There are 52 types of foreign cigarettes sold in Shanghai and other parts of the country, including 3-5, Craven A, Morris, and Camel. All must be affixed with the Ministry of Finance's Cigarette Unified Tax Inspection Certificate for sale on the market, otherwise, they are private goods and should be banned. The Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Tax has received reliable confidential reports that cigarette paper shops and cigarette vendors are still secretly selling unlicensed foreign cigarettes. The bureau believes that the sale of these private foreign cigarettes is enough to prevent the three domestic cigarette products. It has been decided to dispatch personnel in the near future to carry out surprise spot checks. All private foreign cigarettes without an inspection certificate will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Tricycle Prices Adopt Station System; Negotiated This Saturday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Due to the lack of standards for bargaining for tricycles and rickshaws after the currency reform, citizens feel that they cannot afford it. The Bureau of Social Affairs decided to invite the police bureau, the public utilities bureau, and the labor and management of the industry to discuss the issue of restricting vehicle prices this Saturday (September 9). In principle, it is planned to divide the area, adopt a station system, assess the highest vehicle price between each section and station, and post it on each vehicle. The driver shall not bargain beyond this standard, otherwise, passengers can be sent to the police station for punishment. This method has been implemented in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The driver's income is 10 yuan a day</p>
<p>After the currency reform, rickshaw drivers have a limited vehicle rental price, but citizens have an unlimited price for hiring. It is reported that rickshaw drivers now have a daily income of about 10 yuan in gold yuan, but the daily rental of a double rickshaw is only 1.15 million yuan in legal currency.</p>
<h3>Cai Zengxiang Visits Chiang Ching-kuo to Discuss Improving the Fish Market</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Cai Zengxiang, director of the Marine Fisheries Supervision Office in the Jiangzhe District of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, visited Inspector Chiang at the National Bank at 11:00 PM yesterday. It is heard that he made a report and suggestions on the reasons why the city's fishery cannot supply the market. According to sources, the fish market has not been properly managed.

<p>[Our Dispatch] The coal stored for public utilities in the city is insufficient for half a month. Mayor Wu Yuzhang, together with Inspectors Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo, urgently telegraphed the central government, requesting that before the Coal Allocation Office is established (the establishment of the office was originally announced, but the business was shelved for some reason), the Fuel Management Committee should still be ordered to be responsible for the allocation work so as not to affect the business of public utilities. Furthermore, the municipal government has conducted a detailed investigation of the production situation in various coal-producing areas. If the coal allocation continues to be suspended, it will be submitted to the central government for approval to directly contact the coal merchants to purchase coal and transport it to Shanghai to maintain the city's public utilities.</p>
<h3>Zhu Shilong Concurrently Serves as Director of the Anthracite Coal Regulation and Supply Office</h3>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Directly Distributed; Committee for Allocating Yarn to Be Established</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the yarn and cloth market was ordered to close, Bureau of Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian convened a meeting of representatives from various reproduction industry associations yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of direct distribution. It was decided that each industry and factory would organize a Yarn Allocation Committee to review the important quantity, which would be allocated by the Commodity Adjustment Committee. The candidates for the committee will be appointed after consultation between the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Commodity Regulation Committee. According to Director Wu, the target of cotton yarn supply is limited to three types: export, reproduction, and domestic sales. Export is to earn foreign exchange, so the allocation will be more. The products of the reproduction industry are not only supplied for sale in the city but also for domestic sales. In the future, artificial silk will also be managed in this way, specializing in supplying the reproduction industry.</p>

<h3>Residents' Association of Enemy and Puppet Houses Suggests Five Points for Government Adoption</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Residents' Association of Enemy and Puppet Houses in the city hosted guests from all walks of life at the YMCA yesterday to conduct an open review of the government's sale of enemy and puppet real estate. More than 300 guests and resident representatives attended. Several suggestions were made at the meeting to provide the government with adoption. The methods are as follows: (1) According to the explanation of Chinese grammar, the so-called fee-paying users are tenants. Since the Central Trust Bureau has collected usage fees for this enemy and puppet house, it should be considered that the residents have legally obtained the right to lease. According to the provisions of the Civil Law, the transfer of property rights does not affect the lease right. No matter who buys it, the current residents should have the right to continue renting it. For rent, it may be adjusted reasonably. (2) The current residents have priority to purchase, and the valuation methods are: (a) The price of the house should be calculated based on the construction cost before the war, minus depreciation, and then converted into gold yuan. (b) The price of the base should be calculated according to the valuation of the Municipal Land Administration before August 19, and converted into gold yuan. (3) After the current residents have priority to purchase, the payment period should be extended as much as possible, with a minimum of two years. Add legal interest according to the purchase price and pay it in installments on a monthly basis to match the economic conditions of public school teachers and civil servants. (4) For those who are unable to purchase, the government should properly resettle them, so as not to make the current residents displaced and hinder public security. (5) Please refer to the precedents of China Textile Construction Company and other companies to issue government company shares, fill the war stocks and nationalize real estate companies by using enemy and puppet houses as assets, and then use it as a gold standard for circulation.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Stores from Closing Early; Two Police Precincts Ordered to Crack Down; Will Be Charged with Profiteering After Investigation</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the city's various woolen, cloth, and page goods stores have closed early, citing poor sources of goods, which has had a profound impact on the psychology of the public. The Economic Brigade of the Police Bureau yesterday ordered the Huangpu and Lao Zha police precincts in the city's commercial center to strictly crack down on this unauthorized business closure. The goal is to ensure that businesses are opened as usual. If any stores still have the above-mentioned situation, they will be charged with profiteering and will not be tolerated. Yesterday, the Huangpu and Lao Zha police precincts summoned more than a dozen companies to the bureau, including the Huaxin Woolen Company on Henan Road, the Dalun Woolen Company, the Lao Jiuhe Silk and Satin Bureau on Nanjing Road, the Wanshengchang Silk and Cloth Shop, the Lao Jiefu, Hongmian, Zhongyuan, Lihua, Guohua Department Stores, and the Futai Chang Cloth Shop on Jinling East Road, Deshengxiang Cloth Shop, and Dadong Socks Factory Department Store, to inform them to open their business according to the order immediately and not to stop business without authorization.</p>
<h3>Merchants Request to Smooth the Source of Goods</h3>
<p>The rapid trend of panic buying has affected department stores in this city. The Commercial Guild of the Department Store Industry specially dispatched seven representatives, including Ye Fukang, Zhou Zhihong, and Sheng Xiangsun, to visit Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon, requesting him to find ways to smooth the source of goods. Zhang Chude, the chief of the Price Management Section, received them on behalf of the director and promised to forward the request to Director Wu for handling. According to Director Wu's interview with reporters, the Social Affairs Bureau is already paying attention to the panic buying in department stores and will take necessary measures. For essential clothing items such as shirts, towels, and socks, it is planned to adopt the sales method used for cotton cloth and wool. Each citizen must present their ID card to purchase the above items. However, the quantity and timing of each citizen's purchase will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in consultation with the relevant trade association before public implementation.</p>
<h3>Restrictions Also Placed on Purchase of Silk and Satin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] To curb the bad trend of panic buying, in addition to restricting the purchase of wool, woolen fabric, and cotton cloth based on the city's national ID card, it has been learned that silk and satin purchases have also been restricted to one piece of robe fabric and one set of Qi Shan pants fabric per person every six months.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Industrial Raw Materials: Adjustment Committee Decides to Establish a Group</h3>

<h3>Many Tourists, "Dan Bang" Active: Traffic Volume on Two Lines Reaches Saturation Point</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Autumn is typically a travel season, coupled with the activity of "dan bang" (porters), resulting in extremely congested passenger traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Express trains like the Feikuai, Kaixuan, Jinling, Qiantang, and Xihu are filled with high-ranking officials, wealthy merchants, and autumn tourists, while other passenger trains are crowded with ordinary people struggling to make a living. According to statistics from the railway bureau, the average daily passenger volume at the city's North Station has increased from 90,000 to 120,000 in the past week. This number has reached the saturation point of transportation capacity, so the number of trains cannot be increased, and the carrying capacity is already at its limit. Other trains, such as the 5th and 17th trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line, are particularly crowded due to their convenient departure times. Passengers often risk their lives to climb onto the roofs of the cars. The railway bureau believes that this excessive crowding phenomenon will return to normal after the comprehensive control of goods.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Materials in Shanghai Area: General Headquarters Established</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city-wide inspection of materials is about to begin. The police department was ordered to establish the Shanghai District Materials Inspection General Headquarters yesterday, with Yu Shuping as the general commander and Gu Bingyuan, He Longqing, Cai Ren, Wang , and Wang Zhaohuai as deputy commanders. The headquarters has three groups: supervision, liaison, and general affairs. The headquarters is temporarily located in the conference room on the eighth floor of the Police Headquarters on Fuzhou Road. The "Inspection Guidelines" for all staff have been rushed into print by the police department and are expected to be distributed to all units today. The guidelines remind inspectors to be thorough, strict, amiable, and serious when performing their duties and not to accept any hospitality. At the same time, the two categories of paper and industrial raw materials among the seven daily necessities refer to nine types: rough-edged paper, newsprint, cotton, gasoline, diesel, coal, caustic soda, rubber, and pigments. During inspections, in addition to presenting their work permits, they should also be accompanied by local Baojia chiefs. If any of the seven items are found to be unregistered, lack purchase invoices, or exceed the legal quantity, they will be confiscated and the owner will be required to provide a guarantee for safekeeping pending verification.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Surplus Materials to be Implemented Starting Next Saturday</h3>
<p>The distribution of surplus materials to public and educational personnel organized by the Materials Supply Bureau will be implemented simultaneously at the bureau's retail department and designated sales stores next Saturday.</p>
<h3>Riot Case at Shenxin No. 9 Factory: Trial of 37 Defendants Concluded; Secret Trial Claims No Political Influence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yang Guangming and 37 other workers from the Shenxin No. 9 Factory at 140 Macau Road were suspected of inciting strikes and riots on February 2nd of this year. The Special Criminal Court filed a public prosecution against them on charges of endangering the state. Yesterday, the court presented the 37 defendants in custody for a full-day trial, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>The 37 defendants in custody, including Yang Guangming, were brought in from the detention center of the Penglai Police Sub-bureau around 8:00 AM. They were all disheveled and listless. At around 9:00 AM, Presiding Judge Sun Bin and two judges opened a collegiate court for trial. The defendants' defense lawyers were not allowed to appear in court to defend them, and anyone was forbidden from attending. The trial lasted for a long time, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to around 6:00 PM, and the entire process was kept secret. Afterwards, it was learned that the content of the interrogation included three points: (1) whether any of the defendants had participated in the Communist Party; (2) whether they had instigated the mass strike on February 2nd; and (3) whether they had fought with the military and police or assisted in the event. The defendants all denied having participated in the Communist Party and denied having instigated the strike or assisting in the event. They claimed that the cause of the labor unrest was the request to the management for a two-month loan of wages, payment of cost-of-living discounts, distribution of allocated goods, and allocated rice. Because the management showed no sincerity and delayed in responding, it aroused public anger and led to a work slowdown. There was no political influence involved. However, Judge Sun pointed out that when they raised the conditions, they did not first request mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau, but rather had a conflict with the management, which was obviously a violation of the law. Subsequently, the court questioned in detail the situation of the disturbance and the confrontation with the military and police. The defendants, who had been in custody for more than eight months, mostly suffered from serious illnesses and requested bail. Judge Sun stated that as the verdict was imminent, the request was denied.</p>
<h3>National Aviation Enterprise Not Considering Price Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It has recently been rumored that the authorities are considering adjusting the fares of state-owned transportation enterprises. Regarding the aviation sector, reporters interviewed the person in charge of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) yesterday. He said that the price of aviation gasoline in Shanghai has increased from $2.09 to $2.83 per gallon on October 1st. However, the company has not considered the request for a price increase and has not received any notice from the Ministry of Transportation regarding the reporting of cost calculation methods. In addition, the CNAC's Nanyang and Sino-Japanese routes may be launched by the end of the month.</p>
<h3>New One-Fen and Five-Fen Subsidiary Coins: Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Reply that Casting is Being Expedited</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that because the use of legal tender (fabi) was limited to a specific period, and the subsidiary fen coins had not yet been cast, there was concern that prices would rise to the jiao level if preparations were not made in advance.

<h3>Case of Paper Hoarding in a Car Repair Shop: Further Trial Pending Examination of Account Books</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The owner of a car repair shop at 333 Tongfu Road was previously discovered to have hoarded a large quantity of paper of various colors. The owner, Ba Jianfei, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for violating the Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations. Judge Wu Shaochang of the District Court opened a trial yesterday morning. Ba, accompanied by a lawyer, argued in court that he owned the Dehe Paper Shop at 9, Lane 360, Beijing East Road. All the inventory was originally at 149 Wujiang Road. Later, because the place was inhabited and the rooms were small, it was moved to the car repair shop on Tongfu Road, and it was not the case that both places had inventory. He also stated that according to the regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, only newsprint needed to be registered. The newsprint owned by the defendant was only two reams, which was not enough to constitute hoarding. The registration deadline was September 29th, and the defendant was arrested before the deadline, so it could not be regarded as a violation of the law. According to the testimony in court, it was ordered that the defendant's account books be examined, and the trial was adjourned until the 14th.</p>

<h3>Accused of Colluding to Claim Foreign Exchange Beyond the Limit: Ouyang Ming Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Yongyan, a local resident, previously forged the seal of the Jinhua County Chamber of Commerce in the name of the person in charge of the Jinhua Wujiang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in order to fraudulently obtain foreign exchange. He applied to the Import and Export Management Committee to participate in the quota distribution for the third quarter of the previous year and was allocated a foreign exchange quota of HK$29,310. Because there was no co-signing applicant, Ouyang Ming (Ouyang Minggang), the manager of the Shanghai Xiehe Enterprise Company, was responsible for receiving and transferring the goods, settling the exchange in legal tender, and annotating "Received and transferred by Xiehe Enterprise Company" in pencil on the duplicate of the exchange settlement permit. This matter was discovered by the Export Management Committee, which sent a letter to the District Procuratorate for investigation. After the investigation was completed, in addition to the prosecution of Chen Yongyan, Ouyang Ming was also prosecuted on charges of forging documents.</p>
<h3>Compensation Machine Prices Halved: Manufacturers Paying and Taking Delivery</h3>
<p>More than 1,600 Japanese compensation machines allocated to private enterprises have been shipped to Shanghai for more than half a year.

In order to distribute them as soon as possible and avoid damage, the government recently decided to reduce the original selling price by half. Manufacturers are generally satisfied. Therefore, more than a dozen manufacturers have recently paid the Central Bank and contacted the Shanghai Office of the Industry and Commerce Department's Japanese Compensation Materials Processing Committee to take delivery of the goods. The long-delayed processing work can be completed in the short term.</p>

<h3>The Only Executive Agency for Economic Control Work: Expanded Organization of the Operations Brigade; All Members Receive Special Training; Remarkable Achievements Shortly After Establishment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In recent months, the city's economic control work has attracted nationwide attention. Under the command of the economic control supervisors, the police department's Economic Police Brigade is the only executive agency and the vanguard for exerting the effectiveness of economic control. According to statistics from the brigade, they handled more than 1,600 economic control cases in September alone. Notable cases such as those involving Lin Wang Company, Hu Xinyi, Wei Boxiang, Rong Hongyuan, and Zhan Peilin are well known to the public. The regular work of the agency is to monitor the market, day and night, which is extremely difficult. In addition to effectively controlling the market's telecommunications and telephones, it is also necessary to secretly deploy informants and collect intelligence at any time. Its work is different from the criminal police's emphasis on post-event investigation. Instead, it conducts thorough reconnaissance before the crime is revealed. Once the opportunity is ripe, it takes action, and its actions often occur at the moment when the transaction is in progress. Therefore, all members of the brigade have received special training, and it is difficult to complete the task without meticulous attention to detail. For example, the warehouse inspection work, which involved the deployment of all members of the team, has been implemented for nearly three months, laying the most practical foundation for economic control work. During the process, investigation, identification, review, and inquiry are intertwined, and the effort has been fruitful. As another example, Wei Boxiang was engaged in large-scale black market gold and foreign currency trading in the city. The team had been investigating him for a long time. In order to obtain solid evidence, they spent more than 15 days specifically recording Wei's external phone calls and his personal actions, without slacking off for 24 hours a day. Therefore, the resulting record alone was voluminous. Wei himself was unusually alert. Usually, when there were transactions or phone calls, he used codewords and evasive language, which was extremely difficult to grasp. On the night of his arrest, he took a package and went to a certain place by pedicab. Based on the facts obtained from previous investigations, the team determined that the time was ripe, so they raided and arrested him, and found that he was in the process of transacting. The enormity of its work can be imagined.</p>
<p>Originated from the Economic Supervision Group</p>
<p>Currently, the general public's concern for the team is increasing day by day, and the team's activities over the past year have become the subject of conversation among the public. In fact, the team's history is very short, less than a year so far. Its embryonic organization was the Economic Supervision Group, which was jointly established by the relevant bureaus of the municipal government and the investigation department of the garrison headquarters in August 1947. At that time, under the command of the group, the police department had a gold and foreign currency group, which was uniformly commanded by Xuan Tiewu. In November, the group was revoked, and the police department added an economic section under the administrative office and reorganized the Economic Police Brigade, which was headed by Xu Youzuo. In February of this year, the Economic Police Team was merged into the Economic Section and was taken over by Cao Maoliang. The section established gold and foreign currency, daily necessities, and fuel units, and the original members of the team were assigned to serve in various units. In March, due to the heavy workload, the section and team were reorganized, and the Economic Police Team was reorganized again. At this time, the current Cheng Yikuan took over the team's duties.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Team Leader Cheng Yikuan</p>
<p>It has been rumored that Cheng was initially recommended by Chiang Ching-kuo to Shanghai and that everything was arranged in advance. Cheng has denied this. After graduating from Soochow University, he studied at the New Jersey State Police Academy in the United States and the British Criminal Police Academy. He returned to China at the end of 1947. He first worked in the foreign affairs section of the camp bureau, then was transferred to the position of Deputy Chief of the Sisheng Sub-bureau, and then to the position of Captain of the Economic Police Brigade. He said that his experience was somewhat different from the various speculations outside.</p>
<p>In June of this year, the police department, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, specially established the Special Criminal Office, which was headed by Deputy Director Zhang Shi. The Economic Section and Economic Police Brigade, which were originally under the Administrative Office, were transferred to the office. In order to improve the level of economic police, the original number of 70 people was reorganized into a state name, and Yin Zhenming, the Deputy Chief of the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau, was transferred as the Deputy Captain, and Wang Sizu was appointed as the Action Group Leader. After August 19, Chiang Ching-kuo came to Shanghai and ordered the police department to make economic control execution work the focus of the team's mission and transferred the Kanjian First Squadron led by Li Nianzi to be mixed and organized with it.</p>
<p>Will Recruit 100 University Students</p>
<p>Recently, because 50 students borrowed from various universities during the summer vacation have returned to school one after another, the team felt that there were not enough people and will recruit 100 university graduates to participate in the work. Currently, in order to strengthen the team's execution of the inspection of special materials leaving the country, seven land and water inspection teams will be established, composed of the team, the Kanjian Brigade, military police, and police officers from various district police stations. At the same time, the police department has also issued a notice to all police stations to establish economic control groups, with the chiefs of the stations as the group leaders, to regularly contact the team to handle general economic control work. The team itself has also expanded its organization, determining four groups: reporting, action, intelligence, and surveillance. In addition to the four group leaders, there are also 14 squad leaders, and it is stipulated that the squad leaders will lead the team during duty, wearing plain clothes, wearing yellow armbands, and carrying work permits. In addition, an "Economic Inspection Manual" has been compiled and printed, detailing the main points of various duties. It is expected that in the future, economic control work will be carried out more effectively under a strict and proper arrangement.</p>
<h3>Launching a Thrift and Diligence Campaign: Organizing the Shanghai Branch of the Vigorous Implementation Association; Responsible Persons for Preparation Appointed</h3>
<p>In order to launch a thrift and diligence campaign, people from all walks of life in the city held the second thrift and diligence movement symposium at the Military Friends Society on Zha Pu Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to exchange opinions. Fang Zhi presided over the meeting. Fang first stood up and said that the promotion of the thrift and diligence movement is to change the social habits of extravagance and debauchery and establish a style of diligence and thrift. The launch of this movement is of great significance in awakening wealthy people. He hoped that the attendees would speak enthusiastically and provide valuable opinions. Then Zhang Yi spoke, saying that the thrift and diligence movement is to establish a good atmosphere and is a spiritual sanction against extravagant people. He hoped that the people leading this movement would have the greatest courage to transform a rational atmosphere. He also proposed that "diligence" should be maintained permanently without violating human relationships and within reason, and "thrift" should strive for simplicity in customs and habits to make life rational. Qin Runqing said that thrift and diligence should be practiced by example to enable the movement to be expanded and promoted. Wang Guanqing advocated striving for economy in clothing and food, increasing production, and promoting healthy entertainment. Qiu Xisheng hoped that guests would be served with plain boiled water in the name of thrift and diligence, and that no refreshments would be served at tea parties to create a new atmosphere. Fan Zhengbo hoped that the thrift and diligence movement would be thorough and avoid becoming formalistic. Xu Mingya advocated promoting the movement through organization and using moral persuasion. Finally, it was passed: (1) Luo Dunwei proposed to organize the Shanghai Branch of the Thrift and Diligence National Building Vigorous Implementation Association and appointed Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Fan Zhengbo, Xu Jiyin, Wu Yunxu, Xie Renzhao, Luo Dunwei, and others to be responsible for preparation. (2) The Military Friends Society is now jointly presided over by all sectors of the party, government, and military.

<h3>Great Fire at Yangjiadu, Pudong: Carelessness at Hongfeng Factory Workshop Causes Fire, Destroying Over Two Hundred Shanties; Firefighter Injured, Infant Drowned</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A fire broke out at approximately 1:45 PM yesterday in room number two of the male workers' dormitory of Hongfeng First Yarn Factory in Nantao Nitang, Yangjiadu, Pudong, due to a worker, Ju Lianchen, privately and carelessly tapping into the electrical wires.

During the height of the fire, Liu Zhongrong, a firefighter from the Pudong Fire Brigade, fell from the roof, injuring his hip. He was subsequently rushed to the hospital for treatment. Due to the strong winds, the fire was not extinguished until around 5:30 PM, having consumed sixteen male workers' dormitories and over two hundred nearby shanties. Residents of the shanties fled in panic, carrying the elderly and children, a truly chaotic scene. In one shanty, a woman who had just given birth to an infant the previous night was forced to flee hastily, carrying the baby. Amidst the crush, while crossing a small bridge, they were pushed and jostled by the crowd, and the infant fell into the river and drowned.</p>

<h3>Operations Span Three Provinces and Cities: The Sui District Pacification and Construction Team Will Be Transferred South</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The phenomenon of panic buying of goods in this city has become quite serious recently.

<h3>Song Ziwen Reflects on His Year in Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>[Our Report from Guangzhou, 4th (by airmail)] October 3rd marked the first anniversary of Song Ziwen's administration in Guangdong. The day before, Song held a grand press conference, expressing many meaningful thoughts. This was the fifth time reporters had seen Chairman Song in a year, and the first time they had heard his hearty laughter.</p>
<p>On a rainy afternoon, the conference hall of the provincial government was filled with reporters waiting for news. At 3:00 PM, Chairman Song strode in, the buttons on his short-sleeved Hong Kong shirt still undone. He nodded continuously to the reporters, his smile unwavering for the two hours. It was easy to imagine a spring-like atmosphere in the autumn of South China from his tanned and determined face.</p>
<p>Welcoming Criticism as a Good Thing</p>
<p>The solemn provincial government conference hall rarely sees such a relaxed scene. As soon as Chairman Song opened his mouth, asking, "What guidance do you all have?" the reporters immediately fired off an interesting question: "Chairman Song, what are your thoughts on your year in Guangdong? What is the most pleasant thing you feel?" He seemed hesitant about this broad and specific question, taking a deep drag on his cigarette before replying in a half-joking tone: "My thoughts cannot be considered thoughts. The thoughts of you reporters truly represent the thoughts of the people of Guangdong, so I will say less. As for the most pleasant thing for me personally in the past year, it is the arbitrary attacks on me personally by a portion of people in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places who are unaware of the truth. If there were no attacks from them, it would show that I had not done anything, so it would not arouse their interest in reacting. Probably because the things I have done have progressed and have some achievements, it has aroused the attacks of this small group of people who are unaware of the overall situation. So, my first happy thing in my year in Guangdong is this." This unexpected "happy thing" caused a roar of laughter. After that, Chairman Song continued to review the gains and losses of military and political measures with a frank attitude.</p>
<p>Security Situation Worthy of Comfort</p>
<p>Regarding the suppression of bandits, Song first explained that the security in Guangdong province in the past year has greatly improved compared to before, which is the most comforting thing for him personally. The National Army stationed in the province has been mostly transferred elsewhere due to military needs over the years. However, since the successful organization of fifteen security and defense groups throughout the province, they are more than enough to replace the power of the National Army. After a year of suppression, the bandits that were rampant years ago have all been silenced. For example, the transportation lines in the Guangdong-Jiangxi border area, northern Guangdong, and the Pearl River Delta, which were the most severely affected by banditry, are now all unimpeded. However, he admitted that "suppressing bandits is easy, but eradicating bandits is difficult," so the main military work in the future will be to organize and train local armed forces to strengthen self-defense capabilities, so as to ensure that banditry cannot be revived. As for the rumors that the security situation in South China is "unimaginable," Song specifically stated in a firm tone that he "absolutely does not admit it!"</p>
<p>Careful Selection of Talent, Progress in Officialdom</p>
<p>Next, talking about the issue of officialdom, Song first said with emotion: "The corruption of Guangdong's officialdom did not begin today, but when you (referring to the reporters) were still children." Decades of habit have been formed, and it is indeed difficult to change this accumulated malpractice. For example, "It is necessary to find good people, but 'good people' and 'bad people' certainly do not have signs engraved on their foreheads. It is really not easy to find more than a hundred good county magistrates." However, he will never be discouraged because of this, and said that as a result of careful selection of talent since his arrival, it has been proven that the atmosphere of officialdom has greatly changed. The rumors that "several million Hong Kong dollars can buy a parent official" will not only no longer be heard in the future, but will also disappear forever.</p>
<p>Construction Funds Raised by the Province</p>
<p>In terms of provincial government finances, the income of current provincial-run enterprises has doubled compared to a year ago. Provincial construction projects, such as dike engineering, increasing police security forces, the Wengjiang Yongli construction project, the construction of the Nanling Railway branch line, and the Maipu port construction, all require funds that are raised by the province, without requiring the people to increase their tax burden by a single cent. Speaking of this, Song said with a pleasant tone: "Only this point is considered to be the most worthy of my hometown," and expressed that he will step up construction in the future to achieve success. After the financial expenditure improves, the first step will be to increase the salaries of civil servants.</p>
<p>Eliminating Bad Habits, China Can Be Saved</p>
<p>Finally, talking about the most criticized price issue recently, some people said that when he was not here, Guangzhou's prices were only the second or third highest in the country. When he came, Guangzhou's prices jumped to the top of the country. He believes that this is just an excuse for "professional attackers" and is not worth pursuing. In particular, regarding the recently noisy issue of "unnamed figures in Guangdong embezzling military funds," he specifically asked Du Meihe, the general manager of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, to report in detail again on the matter of the Guangdong Provincial Bank purchasing more than 590,000 yuan in Hong Kong dollars to buy Siamese rice for disaster relief, and said with emotion: "There is an old saying in China called 'Protecting oneself with wisdom,' so most officials do not seek merit, but only seek no mistakes." Today, it has been further advanced to "the more you do, the more mistakes you make; the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make; and it is better not to do anything." The so-called "no one scolds for dividing the spoils, but someone scolds for doing things." If this kind of bad habit in the officialdom is not broken, China will definitely be incurable. Therefore, if you don't do things, it's fine, but if you do things, you must fight to the end with these people with conscience and blood. One</p>
<p>Finally, talking about national affairs, he said very clearly: Not long ago, he did go to Hong Kong and "advise Li Jishen as an old friend and old colleague not to be used by the Communist Party and do things that betray the country." "But whether he listens or not is up to him!"</p>
<h3>Chao County People's View of Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Bao Baiping</p>
<p>[Our Report from Chao County, 1st] Feng Yuxiang, known to the world as a "rebel general" and a "Christian general," is like a precious ornament in a poor family's house in the eyes of the people of his hometown of Chao County, which does not help the poor life. Feng Yuxiang was born and rose to prominence in North China and has never had a deep relationship with Chao County. Very few, almost none, of the people of Chao County have risen in status by relying on him. The people of Chao County only see him as a "figure" and regard him as an ornament for the county, and nothing more.</p>
<p>However, his name has always been loud. Even women and children know that "a Feng Yuxiang came from our county"! In June of this year, he sent a letter from the United States to Chao County saying that it was hot in New York, where he lived, and that he was going to the countryside to escape the heat. After that, no one knew where he went. There are too many rumors: to Europe, to Hong Kong, and even that he will return to the "liberated areas" of China. His whereabouts have become a mystery. The people of his hometown are counting his life and sighing for him.</p>
<p>On September 6, newspapers published the news of his death, saying that he was burned to death on a ship traveling to the Soviet Union. This figure, who had dominated the political scene in China for forty years and played the protagonist in many tragedies, ended his sixty-seven-year life with a tragic fate. The news of his death came quite suddenly. When the reporter arrived in Chao County, some people were still half-believing.</p>
<p>Zhuke Village</p>
<p>Going north from the North Gate of Chao County along the Hechao Highway for more than twenty li, the hilly terrain makes the highway undulating. After the car climbs up a larger slope, you will see a village located on the right side of the slope. No more than forty small tile and thatched houses are scattered haphazardly among the fields. This is the original home of Feng Yuxiang—Zhuke Village under Caoxieling, Xiage Township, Chao County.</p>
<p>It is unknown in what era the Feng family lived in this village. Like ordinary farmers, they worked at sunrise and rested at sunset, spending their years in the fields. Because the place is desolate and the land is barren, farmers are lucky to be able to eat their fill after a year of hard work. Most people struggle on the brink of starvation. Even today, although this poor village has produced the figure of Feng Yuxiang, it is still dilapidated and desolate, and no different from the general economically bankrupt rural areas. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese knew that this was Feng Yuxiang's old home and doubled their destruction. The two tile houses where the Feng family had lived for dozens of days no longer exist. Even the families in the village who were not surnamed Feng suffered the disasters of being in the wrong place. It has become a dilapidated village.</p>
<p>Returning Home in Glory</p>
<p>In the seventh year of Guangxu, Feng was born in Xingji Town, Qing County, Hebei. His childhood was entirely in Baoding. In February of the 26th year of the Republic of China, when he was the Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, he returned to his hometown of Chao County. Returning home in glory was most appropriate for him. Feng Jishan, whose family was cramped in a room in Kanggezhuang, Baoding, and who had no food for the night, would never have thought that he would have today? He stayed in his hometown for two weeks for the first time and went to Beijing. In March of the same year, he returned to his hometown again and stayed until the end of April. During these dozens of days, he lived in Zhuke Village.</p>
<p>When he was in his hometown, he brought one million pine trees, as well as locust trees and Feicheng peach trees. He mobilized the nearby farmers to plant trees. Now, ten years later, the pine trees on Caoxieling are lush and have become a forest. But the owner of the trees has become ashes in a foreign land. If he knew in death, he would regret not seeing this because he took the wrong step.</p>
<p>He also brought his method of leading troops to the countryside. He liked to give small favors. He organized a Respect for the Elderly Association. All people over the age of fifty within five miles of the area received his small favors. He invited them to eat and drink, gave them coarse cloth, and explained how to raise chickens and ducks. These were all things that the people in the countryside regarded as honorable and were grateful for, but they were not aware of Feng's merits and crimes to the country.</p>
<p>When the east was just white, this noble person who had returned to his hometown got up. A set of blue coarse cloth short shirt and pants, matched with cloth shoes and cloth socks. It was really hard to imagine that he was the Deputy Chairman. He knocked on doors from house to house. Anyone who had not yet gotten up, he scolded for laziness at the door in the tone of instructing soldiers. When walking, he would go down to the fields to help with cultivation. No matter who asked to see him, he would talk about the history of feeding livestock, and finally politely say a few words: "I am a small person and can only talk about small things." In Feng's own mind, he had not made this trip in vain.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had returned to his hometown in his life, and it was also the last time.</p>
<p>Decline of the Feng Family</p>
<p>Feng's father, Feng Youmao, was originally a mud craftsman in Zhuke Village. There were four brothers. Feng Youmao was the second oldest. The oldest died very early and has no descendants. The third oldest was a tailor, and the fourth oldest was a tenant farmer. The family was poor, and they had always lived separately. During the Hong Yang Revolution, Feng Youmao had no permanent property and ran very far when he fled. He married a woman surnamed You in Jining, Shandong. He had seven children. According to Feng's "My Life": "The brothers were malnourished and five died." The only remaining ones were his eldest brother Feng Jidao (Hao Zhizhai) and himself. It is said that Feng Jidao is now over seventy and lives in Beiping. The original wife had two sons, both of whom have passed away. The second wife also had two sons. Feng Jidao is living a very poor life with his two sons and one grandson and has not returned south for many years.</p>
<p>Feng's original wife was surnamed Liu. The eldest son, Hongguo, is now forty-three years old and is a soldier like his father. Before Feng left the country in the 35th year, the highest authorities specially allowed him to enter the Army University. It is said that he is still in Chongqing. When he entered the Army University, he was only the father of one child. The second son, Hongzhi, went to the United States to study mechanics in the 34th year. He married an overseas Chinese daughter in the United States two years ago. He has not yet completed his studies. The two daughters are married in the north. No one in Chao County knows what the situation is like. Li Dequan is the second wife and has three daughters and one son. The eldest daughter, Lida, was buried in the fire pit with Feng this time. The others all went to the United States with Feng.</p>
<p>There are now about ten Feng surnames in Zhuke Village. In addition to the descendants of the third and fourth houses, the rest are Feng's distant relatives. Everyone wears straw sandals and plows the spring and summer under Caoxieling, regardless of the cold and heat. The Feng family in Zhuke Village is quite declining.</p>
<p>The Mansion is Lonely</p>
<p>On the 26th, on a gloomy morning, the reporter found the Feng Mansion, which was most loudly advertised, at the Xiaodong Gate of Chao County. This mansion faces east and west, with high walls and black doors, which is rare in this small place. Walking into the gate, there is a large courtyard. Everything has been newly repaired and painted. The three main rooms in the middle are large enough to accommodate forty or fifty guests. The floor is shiny and can be used as a family ballroom. However, many Western-style furniture and even sofas are piled up inside, indicating that the owner has not moved in. The whole thing is immersed in loneliness, as if mourning for the owner who died in a foreign land.</p>
<p>In the living room on the north side of the courtyard, I found Mr. Wang Qunxian, the temporary owner of the mansion. He is the son-in-law of Feng's cousin Zhuchu and served as an adjutant by Feng's side for many years. I thanked him for his cordial reception and told me the origin of this house.</p>
<p>In May of the 35th year, Feng returned to the capital after his rehabilitation. The ship passed through Wuhu. He ordered Mr. Wang to return to Chao to see if there was a place to live. Mr. Wang reported that in the dilapidated Chao County, there was a serious housing shortage and there was no place to live for a while. Feng decided to buy a house. This was the first time he had purchased property in his hometown. Mr. Wang returned to Chao and quickly bought the Ge family's house. The value at the time was 8.5 million yuan, with a total of twenty-three rooms. There was also a piece of open space behind the house. It was repaired last spring and is now managed by Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago, Feng knew that Zhang Zhizhong had established a school in Huanglu, his hometown. He also set up Tuanshan School near Zhuke Village, planning to establish a school from elementary school to middle school. It was destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery fire shortly after its establishment. After the victory, preparations were made to re-establish the school. After buying the house, he bought 300 acres of land near his old home and said it would be used as a school fund, but the school has never been restored, and I am afraid it will never be restored in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said that since receiving Feng's letter in June to go to the countryside to escape the summer heat, he has not received any more letters. Mrs. Li Dequan has not received any telegrams either. Except for the news in the newspaper, he and ordinary people do not know anything else.</p>
<p>Definite Conclusion</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Zongpeng, Speaker of the Chao County Council, graduated from the third term of Baoding. He and Feng had the elegance of classmates. When the reporter asked him about his views on Feng, he pondered for a long time. He said that standing in the position of a fellow villager, it seemed that he should not criticize him after his death, but he had never agreed with his way of doing things. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, when Feng was the commander of the Sixteenth Mixed Brigade, he met him in Liujiamiao, Hankou, and he instinctively felt that his military management was hypocritical. In the seventeenth year, the Ministry of Military Affairs was established. Feng was the Minister. Zhang Zhizhong was originally scheduled to be the Director of the Army Department, but Zhang resigned forcefully because of Feng's volatility and unwillingness to work with him. He also revealed a privacy of Feng's. He said that when Feng was in Baoding, he expressed special affection for his original wife, but suddenly one night, his wife died without any illness. It is said that Feng killed her.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited an old man of seventy years old (he did not want to reveal his name), he denied everything about Feng. He said that a person who came from the army knew more than enough about the psychology of soldiers, but it was not possible to truly shoulder the important responsibilities of the country. Feng Yuxiang's childhood name was called "Ke Bao," and his original name was "Ji Shan." The three words "Feng Yuxiang" were temporarily given to him by a leader when he first joined the army. Looking at his life deeds, he often took temporary opportunities and tricks. It is not glorious to have such a figure in Chao County, standing from the country's position.</p>
<h3>Five Measures to Prevent Attacks by Traitorous Bandits in Wuxing</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Wuxing, 2nd] The county's security authorities recently issued a provincial order, stating that police stations and township offices in various townships and towns are lax in prevention, and incidents of being attacked by bandits and having weapons confiscated occur from time to time. To prevent this, five precautions have been specified and ordered to be followed: (1) All firearms for people's self-defense must be registered within a time limit and must not be concealed. The local government will uniformly deploy them. (2) The police team will strictly implement joint guarantee and collective responsibility. In areas with serious banditry, joint patrols will be implemented, and sentry posts will be set up at key passes for inspection. (3) Police officers and soldiers should not carry firearms when going to townships for official business unless necessary. (4) If any county has a banditry incident, regardless of whether it is a public or private gun, the situation must be reported within five days. (5) Townships and towns that have not lost any guns within three months of being disturbed by bandits will be commended to the township heads, otherwise, they will be given a demerit.</p>
<h3>From Guimenguan in Southwest Changchun, Stranded Refugees Face the Calamity of Dying Like Decorations</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yuyang</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 1st] Changchun, like a lone island battered by waves, stands firm. Since the sudden influx of over ten thousand refugees evacuated from Jilin, the population has surged. The city has no farmland for cultivation and lacks a route for grain supply. Fuel has been cut off since the end of last year, with minimal reserves left. Generating electricity is, of course, impossible; there is no light at night, and no means of transportation. The people struggle to survive with difficulty. Since May 24th, the Communist bandits, having gathered Mongolian and Korean allied forces, have intensified their siege around Changchun. The airport has fallen, planes cannot land, and rice prices in the city have soared. The people can only find wild grass, gourd flowers, bean sprouts, and tree bark to fill their stomachs, while selling off their belongings to exchange for rice bran, distillers' grains, and soybean cakes for consumption. Distillers' grains, soybean meal, and tree bark are not meant for human consumption. Eating them not only impairs nutrition but also leads to digestive problems, resulting in widespread eye diseases and gastroenteritis. Bodies gradually weaken, hair becomes disheveled, and faces become dirty, ultimately leading to death in remote alleys, dilapidated walls, and between crude rooms and ditches. The people of Changchun are playing the leading roles in an unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<p>Air-dropped Food</p>
<p>Air-dropping food is an incredibly difficult task. The Communist bandits' goal is to "cut off the city's food supply, causing the people to collapse or starve, and to scatter the soldiers." Besides enticing soldiers to surrender their weapons and escape the encirclement, they are using anti-aircraft guns to threaten air transport. Therefore, airplanes have to fly high in the clouds. When dropping from low altitudes, it is difficult to guarantee that one hundred percent of the food lands in the city. Moreover, each bag contains a limited amount. Thus, the food dropped with great effort is mainly used for military purposes. Although the people do not receive any, they wholeheartedly welcome the air-dropped food. Whenever airplanes fly over Changchun, the citizens come out to look up and cheer, which can be said to be their only comfort.</p>
<p>In the marketplace, all that can be seen are sales of furniture and clothing. Although the prices are cheap, no one cares to ask. Shops like Tai Fa He have long been deserted and closed. For transactions involving large sums, weights and measures are used to determine the amount. The bank's temporary notes are denominated in units of hundreds of millions. Low-level employees can receive forty billion in currency each month. Only those who have grain are in a golden age. A small amount of rice can be exchanged for many things. Beautiful and delicate young girls are forced into unwanted marriages for ten pounds of rice, and a pair of pants can only be exchanged for a small scallion. Hunger is like a raging flood, attacking every kind-hearted person in Changchun. They look around at the corpses of the starved lying everywhere, a desolate scene. Friends look at each other and sigh, not knowing when the demon hand of starvation will snatch away their lives. Thus, they risk breaking through the encirclement, but batches are intercepted by the heavily guarded bandit outposts on Hongxi Street. The number of people has reached 160,000. Attempting to escape, they are blocked by the hideous Communist bandits, cutting off their path to survival.</p>
<p>Heavily Guarded Bandit Outposts</p>
<p>Hongxi Street is located southwest of Changchun, three kilometers away from the city, adjacent to the suburbs. During the Japanese puppet era, it was an area of residences for Japanese officials. Now, only empty shells remain. Outside the area bordering the suburbs, there are heavily guarded bandit outposts. The refugees intercepted inside are all those who want to break through the outposts to find food. They spend the entire night hoping that Guimenguan (the gate to hell) will allow them to pass. Some surrender weapons or silver dollars to buy a chance to live, while others try to crawl out at night. Unfortunately, if they are discovered, their tragic fate is immediately sealed. Looking at the people waiting inside to be released, most of them are emaciated, dispirited, and restless. Some are searching for green grass and wild flowers to fill their stomachs. Those who have relatives and friends on the street can still ask for supplies through correspondence. Those who have no relatives and friends are likely to find their final resting place in this area.</p>
<p>Starved Corpses Fill the Fields</p>
<p>One tragic scene involves abandoned children crying for their mothers until they have no strength left. They lie on the ground groaning for a long time, and no one cares for them. Perhaps their mothers have starved to death ten steps away, and the lives of these children are snatched away by the merciless god of death. Seeing these pitiful abandoned children, people naturally sympathize with them deeply, but they are also afraid that they will not be able to take their own children out, so they have no energy to care for others. Walking ten or twenty steps further, one can see the even more tragic scene of starved corpses lying everywhere, white bones filling the fields. There are no coffins for burial, and no one to bury them. They are naked, no different from the corpses of dogs and cats. People waiting to leave are touched by the scene, resolving themselves to their fate of death. If they cannot get past these few gates to hell, they will undoubtedly become companions to those skeletons in the future.</p>
<p>The reporter contacted several people who escaped from Changchun and listened to their tragic stories. I couldn't help but feel sad and moved. I record what I heard and present it to the enthusiastic compatriots in society, hoping they will jointly participate in the Changchun food transport and rescue campaign and provide the greatest spiritual support to the garrison troops in Changchun.</p>

<h3>In Liugou Town Between Chengde and Pingquan, Bandits Suffocate Living People in Cellars</h3>
<p>[Air Mail Dispatch from Chengde, This Newspaper, 1st] Liugou is the largest town between Chengde and Pingquan. After the recent recovery, the railway is not open, and this place has become the only thoroughfare between Pingquan and Chengde. Liugou Town has been occupied by bandits for a full four months. After a visit by the reporter, it was learned that the residents' summer food supplies had long been looted by the bandits. Over ten young men were taken away. Secondly, those who served as Baojia chiefs for the bandits have all fled. Later, hearing that the National Army was lenient, they gradually returned. The Communist bandits invented a type of "suffocation" punishment in Liugou. They converted the courtyard of resident Pan Yuting into a district office and dug a cellar in the house. They would put the captured people inside and cover the opening with a large millstone, suffocating them to death. According to neighbors, "Many people have been imprisoned in the cellar, but they have all been taken away. One person suffocated to death, the son of Ma Mingyun from Nangou Mountain. The reason for the death penalty was due to the violation of grain requisition."</p>

<h3>Rent Reduction of 25% in Zhejiang Tolls the Death Knell for "Confused Landlords"</h3>
<p>— Reporter for This Newspaper, Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 2nd] Since Chen Yi took office in Zhejiang, the most notable aspect of his governance policy has been the "moderate land reform." Because the land issue is the fundamental issue of China's economy, if the land issue can be resolved reasonably, the countryside can be stabilized, and the cities can have lasting prosperity. When Chen listed land reform as a provincial administrative task for the second half of this year, both landlords and farmers, inside and outside the province, paid close attention to the progress of this work. However, Chen recently told reporters, "The land ownership problem in Zhejiang is not serious. Due to the uneven distribution of the population in Zhejiang, there is less land and more people in eastern Zhejiang, and more land and fewer people in western Zhejiang. Planned immigration can solve most of the land problem." Since the provincial government has decided to carry out immigration in the 38th year, it is currently concentrating its efforts on thoroughly implementing a rent reduction of 25% instead of land reform, to reduce the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>Rent reduction of 25% is a measure to reconcile the interests of both tenants and landlords to stabilize the countryside. After the revolutionary government was established in Guangzhou, it was first tried out in Guangdong and Guangxi, and later gradually promoted to Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. Zhejiang has been implementing it since the 16th year of the Republic, and it can be said that it has not been hindered and undermined by local feudal forces like other provinces, which led to its suspension. This is the glory of Zhejiang. In the past 21 years, thanks to the efforts of the Party, government, and judicial organs, it cannot be said that there has been no considerable achievement. According to the survey table "Overview of the Implementation of Rent Reduction of 25% in Various Counties and Cities in Zhejiang Province" by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Social Affairs last year, before the rent reduction, the average rent generally accounted for 50.6% of the total annual product, while after the rent reduction, it was 37.55%. The rental burden on tenants has been reduced by an average of 13.05%, which is only 0.05% higher than the standard of 25% rent reduction. These figures look like a good achievement, but in reality, some counties have not implemented it at all (Fuyang, Pinghu, Chongde, Tongxiang, Wuxing, Xiangshan, Tangxi, Yongjia, and Xianju are nine counties that have not reported rent reduction), and some counties have only implemented it in some villages, or the rent reduction is limited to land with permanent tenancy rights. Obviously, rent reduction of 25% has not been implemented universally and thoroughly in Zhejiang. According to a survey by the Department of Social Affairs, there are still nine counties in the province where the rent accounts for more than 50% of the annual product, including Xindeng, Yuqian, Zhenhai, Dinghai, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Shengxian, Tiantai, and Linhai, and fourteen counties where it is more than 40%. The highest rent in Anji even reaches 75% of the annual product. Generally speaking, rent reduction of 25% can be implemented in areas where farmers' associations are well-organized and tenants have permanent tenancy rights, and due to the different distribution of arable land and population, the achievements in western Zhejiang are slightly better than those in eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Main Reasons for Incomplete Implementation</p>
<p>The main difficulties that have prevented the universal, thorough, and even suspended implementation of rent reduction of 25% in the past are: (1) The power of landlords, local bullies, and gentry is too great. They either use their historical and traditional status or their control of rural political power to maintain their own interests, making tenants unable to resist. (2) The landlords are cunning and take advantage of loopholes, either creating clever rental agreements to maintain the original amount or prepaying the next year's rent during the autumn harvest, with the rent often exceeding half of the annual product. Tenants who do not pay the prepaid rent on time will have their land cultivated by others. (3) The farmers' associations are not well-organized or are even controlled by landlords, making it impossible to implement them. The administrative and judicial organs do not enforce them effectively, and because most of the officials are landlords, tenant disputes have not been handled fairly. To overcome these basic obstacles, it is mainly up to the organizers to have strong courage and perseverance, and to no longer allow landlords and local bullies to infiltrate the executive agencies and erode the enthusiasm of the revolution. Regarding the latter, in addition to stipulating that farmers' associations at all levels should recruit a large number of tenants and hired laborers as members, and that more than half of the directors of the rural farmers' associations must be tenants, Chairman Chen has also called on young people to fight against evil forces. This is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Saving Confused Landlords</p>
<p>Ba Yi himself has indeed made the greatest determination for rent reduction of 25%. In the 1570th meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee on August 19, he said earnestly: "…This year, rent reduction of 25% must be implemented universally in all parts of the province. This work should be carried out by the administrative organs, but if the resistance of evil forces is too great, we do not need to be overly拘泥 ordinary laws during this time of suppressing the chaos, and we can thoroughly implement the rent reduction of 25% decree with strong force. In order to fight against the Communist Party's land reform movement, to save the ordinary confused landlords from the pain of being liquidated and struggled by the Communist Party, and to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on equalizing land ownership, we must show the spirit of revolution and take revolutionary measures to do it firmly and bravely. Even if there are some places where it occasionally does not comply with the law, I am willing to be responsible to the central government. If any landlord obstructs the rent reduction of 25% decree, or even refuses to rent out land due to rent reduction of 25%, no matter how high his status or how great his power, just strictly enforce it…"</p>
<p>Watching Revolutionary Actions</p>
<p>These words are firm and powerful, completely in the tone of "iron-fisted politics." For those "confused landlords" in Zhejiang, it is ultimately a death knell, and for the millions of exploited tenants and hired laborers, it is no different from a dawn horn. But in today's countryside, which is seeking to realize the greatest, politics does not rely on propaganda, but on practical action. If Chairman Chen wants to stabilize the rural socio-economy of Zhejiang and universally implement rent reduction of 25% throughout the province this year, he cannot rely solely on his "revolutionary spirit," but mainly on his "revolutionary actions." The millions of farmers in Zhejiang have been awakened by his dawn horn and are watching closely for the appearance of his actions.</p>

<h3>National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee Resolves to Expand National Cotton Joint Purchasing Area; Joint Purchasing Funds Expanded to 150 Million Yuan; From October 10, Factories May Not Purchase Freely</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held its fourth committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Area will be expanded from Shanghai and Hankou to a fully unified joint purchase. Joint purchasing locations will be temporarily set up in Shashi, Hankou, Xi'an, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Nantong, Chongqing, and eight other joint purchasing branches, as well as Jiading, Taicang, Zhoupu, Minhang, Changyinsha, and other joint purchasing stations. Each station will report directly to the Shanghai Joint Purchasing Headquarters. (2) The joint purchasing prices in various regions will be handled in accordance with the price limits in place at that time in various regions. (3) From October 10, factories may not purchase cotton freely anywhere in the country.

If they resell to the branches or stations, they must comply with the price limits in various regions. (4) Joint purchasing funds will be expanded to 150 million yuan, to be borne equally by the Central Bank and national private yarn factories. Two-thirds will be paid before October 10, and the remaining one-third will be paid when the cotton purchase amount reaches one-half of the expected target (3 million shi dan). The funds shared by each factory will be determined according to the number of yarn spindles. (3) In addition to the originally appointed Liu Gongyun, Li Lixia, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, and Wang Lanseng, seven members, Li Shuming, Fan Chengchuan, Pan Jianliang, Chen Shuceng, Shi Fengxiang, Yang San, Li Guowei, and Yang Yizhou, eight members, will be added as members.</p>
<h3>Customs Strengthens Inspection Procedures for Goods Shipped from Hong Kong to Chinese Ports</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] It is reported that in the past, in addition to ordinary import manifests and transit manifests, customs clearance for goods shipped from Hong Kong to China also required the submission of a copy of the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities. It is now learned that the customs authorities have new regulations to strengthen import inspections. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Import packages carried on ships from Hong Kong (including those transferred by the captain)</p>
<p>In addition to listing details in ordinary import manifests or import package lists, each of these packages should be presented with the original package receipt issued by the port of departure. For packages shipped out of Hong Kong, the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities or the export package list certified by the Hong Kong government port affairs bureau should be presented, which should also detail the receipt numbers of each package. Packages that cannot present the package receipt from the original port of departure, or those that originate in Hong Kong but cannot present the certified export manifest or package list, will be regarded as "goods not listed on the manifest," and the customs will detain them and deal with them in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>(2) Transit goods shipped by ships from Hong Kong to Chinese ports and passing through other Chinese ports.</p>
<p>For ships traveling from Hong Kong to two or more Chinese ports, in addition to preparing the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities and the ordinary import manifest to be presented to the customs of the designated Chinese port, (A) upon arrival at the first Chinese port, each transit manifest for the ship to other Chinese ports and the export manifest certified by the Hong Kong authorities should be submitted to the customs officer boarding the ship for inspection. (B) Thereafter, upon arrival at the remaining Chinese ports, the transit manifest to the next port should also be submitted to the customs officer boarding the ship. As for ships that do not carry transit goods destined for Chinese ports, they should also fill out a blank transit manifest, or add a note at the end of the import manifest stating that "no transit goods were shipped from Hong Kong." If any ship fails to comply with these measures, the company managing it will be responsible for being penalized by the customs.</p>
<p>(3) Goods air-shipped from Hong Kong to China.</p>
<p>In addition to preparing ordinary import manifests, these goods must also be presented with the export manifest certified by the competent Hong Kong government agency. Goods not listed on the Hong Kong export manifest, even if listed on the import manifest, will be treated as "goods not listed on the manifest." The above measures will be implemented from today.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Directs Key Points for Foreign Bank Capital Increase</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Financial Management Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, instructing the commercial banks to increase capital. "Foreign Banks in China, whose head offices are not located in our country, the minimum amount of paid-up capital of commercial banks stipulated in Article 3 of the 'Measures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks' should be based on the region where the representative office originally requested approval from the Ministry of Finance is located. If there are branch offices in different county and city areas, each branch office should be calculated by increasing one-tenth. Also, the section on convening a shareholders' meeting to discuss the capital increase method stipulated in Article 2 of the 'Procedures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks' may be exempted, but the representative (or manager of the representative office in China) or agent designated by its head office should apply in accordance with Article 355 of the Company Law. All other sections should be handled in accordance with regulations. The Financial Management Bureau has recently notified the city's Banking Association to inform the foreign banks to implement it immediately.</p>
<h3>Money Shops Adjust Interbank Lending Rates</h3>
<p>The Silver, Money, and Trust Three Associations, after holding a meeting yesterday, decided that from today (6th), the daily interest rate for loans will be changed to 1.3 yuan per thousand yuan, the daily interest rate for interbank loans will be changed to 8 jiao per thousand yuan, and the daily interest rate for deposits will be changed to 4 jiao 5 fen per thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank Stops Providing Autumn Silkworm Loans from Last Year</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Agricultural Bank of China: In order to tighten loans and absorb currency, the authorities have decided to stop issuing loans for this year's ; loans. Several silkworm farmers and cocoon merchants have requested the bank to open loans, but the bank stated that there is no need for this after the currency reform. Because interest rates are currently very low, even if the merchants lack capital, they can apply for loans from other banks besides the Agricultural Bank. There is currently a large amount of idle capital in the market, which can be used to guide money into rural areas and industry.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Silk Market Transactions</h3>
<p>The human silk market yesterday was still attractive, but the trend was sluggish. Over-the-counter sales in this street were slightly light, the textile industry's allocation period was approaching again, and people's hearts were stable. However, the fierce rush to purchase various materials in recent days has greatly stimulated people's hearts. The quantity distributed by the association remains unchanged, and the allocation is minimal, forming a situation of "little porridge and many monks." Transactions for raw silk are scarce under price limits, and foreign sales have improved somewhat, but there are no goods available in the market, and the market is also cold.</p>
<p>Summer goods in silk and satin have already left the market. Due to the rush to purchase goods such as gauze and cloth in recent days, over-the-counter sales of winter women's clothing in this street are also facing a situation of supply not meeting demand. Bed covers are rarely supplied and sold under price limits, and both import and export are sluggish.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sees Mixed Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>The sugar market was stable yesterday, with mixed ups and downs for each grade. The street was slightly dull, people's hearts were scattered, and many were watching from the sidelines, and transactions became rare. The 21st-period granulated white sugar showed fatigue after opening, and the market closed slightly better. Medium and coarse granulated sugar also showed an upward trend. Households consuming Four or Five Car White Refined sugar were watching from the sidelines, and the desire to sell was slightly looser. The market closed with a slight setback, and the rest were stable.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Base Solidified</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market, transactions continued downstream. Holders, aware that raw tea prices in the production areas were at a peak and that the supply sources were quite restricted, stubbornly held onto their goods, hesitating to sell. Consequently, sample sales in the market were not vigorous. Although the buying interest of exporters remained high, they ultimately found themselves in a state of unfulfilled demand, and the volume of transactions decreased noticeably. Several varieties of tea were practically in a state of having a market but no goods, but their underlying potential was showing promise. As for tea for domestic sales, due to the short supply of available goods, the demand from Taicang, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places was strong, and the market foundation was even more solid than before.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Sharp Decline in Arrivals Yesterday; Rice Market Situation Depressed; Limited Grain Transactions, Near-Total Lack of Edible Oil Supply</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals continued to decrease. The South Market saw arrivals of 354 shi and 7 dou, including 205 shi of brown rice. The North Market experienced a severe shortage, with less than 100 shi, only 87 shi and 5 dou. The two markets combined totaled 442 shi. Trading in the market was still not open, and market quotations also decreased. The entire rice market was extremely quiet, and by 10 o'clock, all traders had left.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market remained closed as before. Most traders did not even go to the market. The past bustling atmosphere was now replaced by a desolate stillness.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Transactions saw a further decrease. The amount of soybeans offered was even less. Only seven packages of Poyangzi soybeans were offered sporadically, priced at 13 yuan and 8 jiao. Over 200 packages of Poyangzi black beans were offered, priced at 12 yuan, which were also absorbed by the local market. Corn, red sorghum, broad beans, fava beans, and naked barley were not offered at all. There were still many sesame transactions, but the supply side had also weakened. Fresh raw peanuts from Nanjing continued to be offered, priced at 35 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Only a few dozen barrels of cooked rapeseed oil were offered in the entire city, priced at 43 yuan and 3 jiao. There were no other transactions. Factory allocations from the previous day were temporarily suspended due to disagreements at the China Plant Factory. Furthermore, other oil factories were also unable to make allocations, resulting in a near-total supply suspension in the market, causing great shortages for retailers. Also, yesterday, the police station specially dispatched two mobile police officers to maintain order in the market, but the market order was very good, and no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Three Rice and Grain Markets to Cease Collective Trading</h3>
<p>Following the cessation of trading in the cotton yarn and cloth markets, the three rice, flour, and grain markets in this city will also cease trading. There are three reasons for the cessation:</p>
<p>(1) Since the currency reform, transactions in these three markets have become increasingly sluggish, and the sources of supply have become scarce. Most of the members dealing in rice, flour, and grains have stopped buying and selling in the market, and the daily transaction volume in the market is extremely small.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the scarcity of sources in the market, retail rice merchants are now purchasing directly from production areas and transporting the goods to Shanghai for sale. Although the quantities are small, they are sufficient to maintain the sales of a single store.</p>
<p>(3) With the cessation of market trading, exploitation by middlemen between production areas and retailers can be avoided, and rice prices may be lower. Based on various reasons, these markets are currently deemed unnecessary.</p>
<h3>100,000 Tons of Clean Coal to Be Opened to Supplement the City's Fuel</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Materials and Finance Committee of the Central Bank held its ninth meeting yesterday (the 4th) at 5:00 PM, chaired by convener Li Lixia, to discuss several proposed resolutions. It is reported that regarding the requests from various parties to entrust the procurement of domestic cotton, the committee decided to temporarily postpone discussion in order to comply with the original purpose of unified procurement, as the National Cotton Joint Procurement Office has already been established. Furthermore, regarding the proposal from the Four Joint Offices to allocate 100,000 tons of clean coal, the committee suggested that it be delivered in Shanghai over three months to supplement the city's fuel shortage.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchant Representatives Visit Supervisor Jiang, Requesting Prompt Promulgation of Distribution Regulations; Fangjian Company Sold Cotton Cloth Yesterday as Usual</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market in this city has been ordered by the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisor to cease trading. According to Tang, Chairman of the Yarn Merchants Association, after the association received the order to suspend business from the previous day, the operations of 620 fellow merchants were brought to a standstill. However, retail yarn shops are still continuing to operate. Once their stocks of yarn are sold out, they will also automatically close. There are also 440 brokers who have become unemployed as a result. Yesterday morning (the 5th), the association sent representatives to the National Bank to meet with Supervisor Jiang to request instructions and to request the prompt promulgation of distribution regulations so that business can be restored as soon as possible to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day that cotton cloth was ordered to cease trading. Although there were no transactions inside or outside the market, innerwear factories and Western clothing factories needed lining cloth, but dyeing and weaving factories and Fangjian Company did not supply it, causing a great deal of panic. Fine cloths such as Longtou, Wufu, and Laba Tong, as well as Yuan Bijie, were in high demand.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Fangjian Company sold cotton cloth as usual, including 12-pound Yang He B-grade fine cloth priced at 23 yuan and 6 jiao per bolt, Sijunzi Yuan straight tribute tweed at 29 yuan and 8 jiao, Yuan Bijie at 28 yuan and 2 jiao, Yuan Mercerized cloth at 33 yuan, 42-yard Laoshouxing bleached cloth at 26 yuan and 8 jiao, average 42-yard gray fine cloth at 27 yuan and 3 jiao, 29-yard half-width brand Bijie semi-finished cloth at 23 yuan and 3 jiao, and Hongguang fine Yuan yarn tribute satin at 28 yuan and 3 jiao. Second-grade light-colored printed color ting was priced at 18 yuan, light-colored floral foreign-style fabric at 18 yuan and 2 jiao, and 30-yard Longxu 10-pound coarse cloth at 18 yuan, and Ding 4-yard Yuan fine cloth at 2 yuan and 5 fen per pound. Also, grass-yellow khaki was priced at 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 7 fen, and was limited to door sales merchants. Tiaoli 777 Evergreen Bijie was priced at 27 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen, and was limited to dyeing factories. Second-grade 29-yard half-width Bijie semi-finished cloth was priced at 23 yuan and 3 jiao, and second-grade 40-yard 10-pound semi-finished cloth was priced at 25 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen, totaling 15 types. Also, there were four types of American and Mexican colored cloth, with each household limited to purchasing one type. It is said that a small number of firms sold their purchase permits for an additional 2 yuan and some change. Other types of cloth could be purchased in larger quantities, so the applications were quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Cotton Cloth Association allocated approximately 26,000 bolts of cloth to the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association. Members of the industry association applied to purchase a total of 170,000 bolts. Due to the imbalance between supply and demand, the association once again adopted a lottery method.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Remains Cold</p>
<p>The cotton market has not heard of any transactions opening yet. The market situation is cautiously holding. Booths have no prices and no market. It is rumored that newly harvested cotton from nearby areas of Shanghai suburbs has already entered the market, but cotton farmers are very reluctant to sell, mainly because the price of cotton and the price of rice cannot be reconciled, so transactions are sparse.</p>

<h3>Chairman Ding Convenes Provincial Middle School Principals' Discussion Meeting in Zhenjiang; Exchanges Educational Opinions and Promises to Improve Difficulties</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Zhenjiang 5th Dispatch] Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding convened a discussion meeting with over 40 middle school principals from the province this morning to listen to the opinions of the education sector.

After the speech, the principals spoke successively, unanimously agreeing that education should emphasize both quality and quantity, with character taking precedence in teaching and talent cultivation as the main goal. Vocational teacher training and general middle school education should both be ideal. Insufficient school funding, poor facilities, and the inability to stabilize the lives of teachers are currently the most difficult problems.</p>

<h3>Yinchuan Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Shanghai Easily Defeats Jianchang</h3>
<p>In the Yinchuan Cup table tennis match some days ago, Shanghai and Jianchang faced off in the Yinzhi Group at the Bank of China's gymnasium. The former's basketball team has always been well-known in the banking community. The table tennis team has been inactive for a long time. This time, under the urging of team leader Wang Zongli, they made a comeback. In their first trial run the other day, veterans Lu Jixing and Zhang Hongsheng, as well as the three young players Chen Quan, Yang Yongkang, and Ling Kecheng, developed evenly and easily won a big victory by a score of 13 to 2. Gu Shenghui of Jianchang, who is talented in all areas, stood by and watched, which was also the main reason for the disastrous defeat. The match results are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Wins Losses</p>
<p>Yang Yongkang Three Zero</p>
<p>Ling Kecheng Two One</p>
<p>Lu Jixing Three Zero</p>
<p>Chen Quan Three Zero</p>
<p>Zhang Hongsheng Two One</p>
<p>Jianchang Wins Losses</p>
<p>Zhang Yongyi One Two</p>
<p>Zheng Baoqi Zero Three</p>
<p>Yan Zhimin Zero Three</p>
<p>Xin Kequan Zero Three</p>
<p>Zhang Yongling One Two</p>
<p>The other day, in the Qianzhi Group, Youbang faced off against Pudong. The strength of the two sides was far apart, resulting in a one-sided affair. Youbang fought calmly, with Lu Shentao breaking through four levels on his own, revealing his brilliance. As a result, Youbang beat Pudong 13 to 3, achieving a successful start. In another match in the Muyi Group, Zhejiang Shi faced China Bai at the Siming Gymnasium. In the first round, China Bai was behind 1 to 4. Although they tried harder afterwards, they were unable to surpass the opponent. However, they posed a considerable threat to the opponent. Unfortunately, due to losing too many points in the first round, they suffered the regret of a bad start. As a result, Zhejiang Shi overcame China Bai 13 to 7.</p>
<p>Today (the 6th), there will be four more matches. Chunmao, which failed in the third Yizhi Group table tennis league, will put all its efforts into winning the Qianzhi Group championship. There are no strong players in the Zhongnong nong team, so it is feared that they will not be able to withstand Chunmao's attack. Others, such as Huachi and Siming, are strong and capable and can seize the victory. The results from yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Youbang defeated Pudong (Qian) 13-3</p>
<p>Zhejiang Shi defeated China Bai (Yi) 13-7</p>
<p>(Today's Schedule)</p>
<p>Huaqiao - Donglai (Yin) 6:00 PM China</p>
<p>Huachi - Zhongyang Yi (Yin) 6:00 PM Huachi</p>
<p>Chunmao - Zhongnong Nong (Qian) 6:00 PM Zhongnong</p>
<p>Siming - Xinhua (Yi) 6:00 PM Siming</p>
<h3>Youth Tennis Training Class Scheduled to Open Early</h3>

<p>The Youth Tennis Association has opened a youth training class to promote youth tennis and create a good foundation. Registration has already closed.

As such it was broadened to 36 people, still leaving over a dozen people who could not be accommodated due to space limitations. In order to facilitate the lesson times of each participant, they will be divided into two classes, one class scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the other class scheduled for Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The association has scheduled a standing committee meeting today to review the association's affairs and to make specific decisions on the implementation of the training class. The opening date is also scheduled to be moved forward to 2:00 PM on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Father-Son Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Registration Starts Today at the Green Sports Association</p>

Registration begins today and will close on October 12th. The matches are scheduled to begin on October 16th and will be held at the Green Light venue.

<h3>Middle School Cup Volleyball Tournament - League Regulations Announced, Registration Begins</h3>
<p>The Middle School Cup Volleyball League, organized by the City Gymnasium, began registration yesterday. The gymnasium aims to assist middle schools in the city in promoting extracurricular activities and advocating for a larger-scale inter-school volleyball competition. This will allow participating schools to improve their skills, strengthen relationships, increase competitive interest, and contribute to the national movement of diligence and thrift in building the country. The intention is profound, and all middle schools in the city with volleyball teams are welcome to participate. The following is a summary of the league regulations:</p>
<p>Any public or private middle school volleyball team in the city, male or female, may register to participate (each school may participate with a maximum of one male and one female team. The registration form must be signed and stamped by the principal and the physical education director, and the school seal must be affixed.)</p>
<p>All teams registering to participate in the competition must submit a list of all team members and photos (two photos per person) to the gymnasium's guidance department for registration within the stipulated period before the start of the league, along with a registration fee of five yuan and a security deposit of ten yuan (the security deposit will be refunded at the end of the league). A team that forfeits once will forfeit its security deposit; a team that forfeits twice will be disqualified from this year's league.</p>
<p>Each registered team is limited to twelve players, all of whom must be students enrolled in the school.</p>
<p>The rules of the game for both male and female divisions will follow the regulations of the 7th National Games. (Net height: men 2.15 meters, women 2.0 meters)</p>
<p>This league is divided into male and female divisions, both using a single round-robin format. If there are too many participating teams, they will be divided into groups. A best-of-three format will be used, with a best-of-five format used in the group finals.</p>
<p>The scheduled game schedule, dates, and times cannot be changed by any team, except in cases where the gymnasium has special circumstances and wishes to make changes.</p>
<p>Any team that is more than ten minutes late to the venue according to the gymnasium's clock will be considered to have forfeited the game.</p>
<p>Each team must have at least six players present to participate in the league; otherwise, it will be considered a forfeit.</p>
<p>All league matches will be held at the gymnasium, with matches on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sundays.</p>
<p>If a team has a protest, it should formally submit a written protest along with a protest fee. The protest should be delivered to the league committee within 24 hours of the incident. If the protest is upheld, the protest fee will be refunded; otherwise, it will be forfeited.</p>
<h3>Basketball Exhibition Game Tomorrow Night - Huili Team to Play Mixed Team - 7 PM at the City Gymnasium</h3>
<p>The City Sports Reporters Association originally planned to host a basketball exhibition game tonight, inviting a mixed team to play against Dagong. However, on the eve of the game, the Dagong team suddenly announced that they needed to handle出国手续 (departure procedures) and vaccinations, and would not have time to participate. The Association had received a formal reply from the team authorities a week ago, accepting the invitation, making the last-minute cancellation regrettable. It is generally speculated that Dagong's recent crushing defeat by the Ziqi team has greatly affected the players' morale, and their performance would inevitably be逊色 (inferior). Against the mixed team of Hualian and Chenyou, victory was by no means guaranteed. This fear of losing may be one of the reasons for their inability to participate. With all preparations complete, the Sports Reporters Association has decided to instead invite the Huili team to perform against the mixed team, tomorrow night (Thursday) at 7 PM at the gymnasium. The Huili team recently hired Qian Xucang as a consultant and returned triumphantly from an expedition to Jingxi a few weeks ago. They are sure to deliver a spectacular performance. The mixed team combines the elite of Hualian and Chenyou, including several World Games representatives. The remaining players are also first-class experts, making their fighting power formidable. The match with Huili is sure to be a fierce battle. Huili's main player, Cao Zhiji, had gone to Beijing for business. The Zhengtai Factory urgently telegraphed him yesterday to return in order to strengthen the team's strength.</p>
<h3>Victory Cup Volleyball</h3>
<p>St. John's Secures Championship Berth</p>
<p>The Victory Cup volleyball tournament completed its consolation championship and semi-final matches last night. In the consolation semi-final, Zhenhua competed against Fanxing. Zhenhua, with its tight teamwork, defeated the enemy three games to zero, and will play Tie Ma on the 8th for the consolation championship.</p>
<p>Following that, in the championship semi-final, St. John's competed against Jingwu Association for a place in the final. St. John's reversed the situation to win three games to one, securing the place in the final. They will face Yongyi on the 8th to decide the champion. The results of yesterday's matches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zhenhua 21-13 21-18 21-17 Fanxing</p>
<p>St. John's 21-23 21-8 21-10 21-15 Jingwu</p>
<h3>Nanjing Football League - Player Registration Being Processed</h3>
<p>The teams that have pre-registered for the Nanjing Football League include Samsung, Xin Xianlin, Huaguang, Hengyisheng, Pan Team, and Far East, a total of six teams. Longtou has also verbally stated their intention to participate, but has not yet notified the sports field in writing. The field has notified the above six teams separately yesterday that player registration procedures should be completed from today until Double Tenth Day. When registering, players must submit a 2.5-inch half-length photo and a registration fee of 金圆券 (gold yuan notes) 0.5 yuan per person. Each team is limited to 15 registered players. After one match has been played, each team may add two new players each time, but must complete the registration procedures 48 hours before the start of the match. As for the applications to participate from teams other than the 复兴杯 (Revival Cup) group champions, there are nearly ten more teams. Due to the limited space at the field, only eight vacant spots are available. Therefore, a decision will be made after the above teams have completed the registration procedures, and the vacant spots will be filled by the applicant teams.</p>
<h3>Xuhui vs. Pan Team in Football Match</h3>
<p>The Xuhui football team is scheduled to play against the Pan Team at 3:30 PM today at the school's field in Xujiahui. The Pan Team has participated in this year's Group B League and is not weak. Xuhui is known in the football world. When they meet, a fierce battle is inevitable.</p>

<h3>A Weak Voice</h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>For the sake of livelihood, perhaps by chance, I resumed my teaching career after abandoning it for more than ten years; moreover, I've been teaching for three years, and at a school that is "quite reputable."</p>
<p>With my kind of "teacher qualifications" squeezed into a "quite reputable" school, I was initially a little apprehensive, and even a little ashamed of "filling the ranks." However, as time went on, the feeling of "filling the ranks" gradually faded, and doubts about the reputation of "quite reputable" schools expanded.</p>
<p>My so-called "filling the ranks" stems from the fact that I teach for a living - that is, I regard the teaching position as a job; not only do I lack the spirit of "teaching for education," but I also lack the lofty will to "nurture talents"; in a word, it's just for food. Entering the sacred field of education with this attitude, "guilt" should be a condemnation that someone with a remaining conscience should feel, right?</p>
<p>However, as time went on, I not only stopped feeling "guilty" but even became a little proud. Because I see my colleagues not only lacking the spirit of "teaching for education," but even those who treat the teaching position as a job and work earnestly are very few. At most, they only regard it as a side business.</p>
<p>Need evidence? It's readily available.</p>
<p>I remember that whenever the semester started, after half a year's salary was paid out, the teachers' room was immediately flooded with talk about prices: gold, US dollars, cotton yarn, and what-not. They chimed in and harmonized, creating a ruckus. Then came talk about what you invested in and what I invested in. Some invested together, some did it alone (of course, very few were successful). Later, they followed the ups and downs of the invested goods, the overjoyed at the profits, boasting of their unique insight, and the dejected at the losses, regretting their incompetence. I ask you, how much energy is left to engage in nurturing the next generation under such tight or relaxed circumstances? Being able to muddle through is already a talent.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, of course, cannot be blamed solely on the teachers; the teachers cannot bear the responsibility for the environment that creates it. Sacred work cannot be demanded from people who are weeping in rags and whose children are crying from hunger and cold. However, this is the reality, the reality of the education sector for more than two years since the victory!</p>
<p>My doubt about the reputation of "quite reputable" schools is that "reputation" is only its exterior and not its content. For example, reciting the classics has long become a joke, but the Analects or Mencius have become required textbooks for junior high school. As for senior high school, students have to write essays on this and that; the more ancient the topic, the more erudite the teacher seems, and the longer the essay, the more outstanding the teacher seems, and the articles are all in the style of antiquity, either from the Tang or Song dynasties. Order is also something they emphasize particularly. As long as teachers have a way to turn students into puppets, lined up in the classroom, they are first-rate teachers. As for the methods of discipline, however, they are all up to you: hitting the palm of the hand is okay, kneeling is also fine. In short, if you can turn students into underage old people, that is your "teaching performance."</p>
<p>This situation seems to be prevalent in the Chinese education sector in the mid-20th century!</p>
<p>This situation is heartbreaking, but it is natural under the current circumstances where education is regarded as an ornament. Therefore, the condition of our next generation can be imagined.</p>
<p>Whoever can eradicate the teachers' despicable mentality of treating the teaching position as a side business, whoever can expose or eliminate the false reputation of "quite reputable" schools, is the true Chinese hero, the national savior!</p>
<p>For the sake of our next generation, I am willing to voice this weak call about the unreasonable educational phenomena of destroying youth that I have heard and witnessed for more than two years.</p>
<h3>Critic</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>One bright spring morning, the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius took his students for a walk in the forest. The birds were singing, the flowers were fragrant, and the weather was excellent.</p>
<p>Sibelius had always enjoyed walking in the woods, and he could identify the different birds by their calls. As they walked, Sibelius told his students the names of the various birds.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a crow came along and cawed very loudly, disturbing the beautiful sounds of nature in the forest.</p>
<p>"What bird is that?" asked Sibelius' student.</p>
<p>The great musician replied with great disgust:</p>
<p>"A critic."</p>
<h3>The Food Problem</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>Recently, the food problem in England has become quite serious. A British person said: "Why can't we produce more food? Because we have to export agricultural machinery. Why do we have to export it? Because it makes foreign countries produce more food. Why do we want them to produce more food? So that they can export it to us. Why do we want to export more to us? Because we don't have enough to eat. Why don't we have enough to eat? Because we must export..." This is not a joke. The joke is politics.</p>
<p>Looking at British and American magazines in recent years, they are quite concerned about the problem of too little land, too many people, and not enough food. The United Nations has a Food and Agriculture Organization that has loudly warned the world: restoring pre-war food levels is of no use because the world's population is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Is there a solution? Yes. If England doesn't export agricultural machinery and strives to increase production, the British Isles may be self-sufficient. But the government must export - to exchange for foreign currency. What is the foreign currency used for? To repay war debts or to fund military spending.</p>
<p>If countries diverted the funds spent on military scientific research to agriculture, agricultural production would increase greatly, and people would not have to worry about food. But no, military first, atomic bombs first. Too many people and not enough food? Okay, drop a few atomic bombs and kill hundreds of millions of people, and the food problem will be solved—or at least half solved?</p>
<p>There is another way: fewer "blessings of adding sons." But that won't do. Hitler encouraged Germans to have more sons; do you think that fascism should be overthrown? Hold on. England is the most democratic, but it is using every method to reward having many children and grandchildren. The government, organizations, and individuals are all doing their best to promote childbirth. England's democracy may be old or fake democracy, so what about the new and true democracy of the Soviet Union? I hear that the Chinese Goddess of Mercy has followers in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Planned reduction of food production, and planned multi-child families; it's planned to make people starve for public service. China is more advanced in this respect: everything is left to fate. For four or five thousand years, nothing has gone wrong. Excellent, excellent!</p>
<h3>Wandering Through Caihua Path</h3>
<p>— Yao Yuanchu</p>
<p>Caihua Path in Shijiazhuang, north of Songjiang, is inhabited by many bamboo artisans. Continuous fields of bamboo stretch for tens of millions of stalks, dense and lush, so that from the outside, the path seems to disappear. Gradually going down, pushing aside artemisia and brambles, stepping on fallen leaves, after several turns, it suddenly opens up, with tiled houses, bamboo fences, and glazed windows, hidden in the misty haze. Ducks are released in the ponds, cattle return to the fences, and children and women seem to be enjoying themselves. Indeed, the world outside Wuling is originally an allegory for isolated indignation; recluses in deep mountains are not suitable for the present world. Such a place, densely located in the city, accessible by cart wheels, is simply that travelers have not yet arrived, so it is not worth mentioning. However, its waters are clear and bright, the fields are secluded and deep, the autumn air is refreshing, and walking with a bamboo staff is not entirely insufficient for relaxation. I record a short poem to express its beauty.</p>
<p>Where sunlight does not reach, village sounds are heard from time to time; the path ends where the stream rises green; bamboo merges with the horizontal fence; evading the world is not a plan, each has their own business in laborious life; returning to Jiangyun with double intentions, the lush green invites leisurely strolls.</p>
<h3>Rhyming with Uncle Fan on Mr. Zhegu's Inkstone</h3>
<p>— Huang Yunmei</p>
<p>My head can be severed, but my will cannot be taken away; the partridge's strange actions are strikingly abrupt; lights flicker in Baiyun Village; celebrating resurrection on the edge of death. From now on, I am a landless orchid, coming and going alone, not returning to my old home. In the barren mountains, the white days are white; I would rather rinse my mouth with neighboring stones until death. Selling art in poor markets with a low hat brim, who recognizes the loyal heart hidden in my clothes? How pitiful, emperors and kings follow fleeting flowers; Mr.'s relics emerge from the sea; the stone box's inscriptions are buried in cold flames; losing that and gaining this increases sighs. 米芾 (Mi Fu) could appraise ancient good inkstones, and once said that this inkstone was an excellent choice; for hundreds of years, mud has settled at the bottom of the Fen River, with dragons protecting it, stopping the battles. Alas, the remote mountain stronghold connects to Wengzhou, ruler and subject weeping in the autumn breeze; past events are like dreams, unbearable to look back! Unbearable to look back, looking at the old shores, the barbarian horses come again to graze on our land; what need is there to hide the ten-layered leather case? We should draft an檄文 (proclamation) and raise the drums of righteousness!</p>
<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>— Liu An</p>
<p>Vanderbilt was one of the richest men in America. He used to run the New York Central Railroad Company. Another rival, Gould, ran the American Eastern Railroad Company. America's railroads were originally privately run, so the competition was very fierce. Initially, the freight for transporting cattle from Buffalo to New York was $125 per car. Vanderbilt, in order to grab business, lowered it to $100. Gould was not willing to give up, and lowered it to $75. Vanderbilt lowered it again, to $50. Gould came up with another trick, lowering it to $25. Vanderbilt made an astonishing move: transporting cattle from Buffalo to New York would cost only one dollar per car!</p>
<p>Gould couldn't stand it, and all the business went to Vanderbilt. But Gould had another brilliant plan: he secretly went into the livestock business, buying a large number of cattle from Buffalo and transporting them to New York on the railroads run by Vanderbilt. Because the freight was low, and the price of cattle in New York was always much higher than in Buffalo, he actually made a fortune in the process.</p>
<h3>Various Collections</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Having a hobby can burden one's body." However, if a person has no hobby, then life feels dull and the spirit has nothing to rely on. Hence, there are so-called collectors, who widely collect and extensively acquire, exhibiting, playing with, and rubbing them, all for the purpose of alleviating worries, resolving sorrows, pleasing the mind, and satisfying the nature. Indeed, they cannot be severely criticized. I am one such collector, specializing in searching for letters from past sages and contemporary figures, accumulating more than a thousand pieces, which I consider more valuable than gold and foreign currency. People from Jing laugh at me for being foolish, and ignore me. According to what I know, Ye Xia'an of Panyu has Ming Xuande incense burners that fill his cabinet. Gong Zhanlu, a Grand Historian, had 300 Yangxian Zisha teapots, mostly made by famous artisans such as Dabin, Mansheng, Maolin, and Zhongfang, making his collection the richest in the country. Also, calligrapher Feng Chaoran cherished small ivory boxes, playing with them all day long and never letting them out of his hand. Even a slight touch causing minor damage would lead to several days of regret. Someone told him, "If you are sick and moaning in bed for dozens of days, this box will certainly not remember you." Chaoran smiled at this. Also, Yuan Lizhun, a lecturer, was skilled in calligraphy and painting and collected a great deal of ink, writing "Ink Essays" with meticulous annotations, not lightly showing them to others. Qian Huofo, a famous painter of Buddhas, had tastes quite different from others. He spent decades of effort accumulating cigarette boxes and matchboxes, no less than several thousand kinds, calling them "incense and fire karma," which drew laughter from viewers when occasionally exhibited. Also, my deceased friend Huang Huiwen of the Nanshe collected twenty-six inkstones, including a half-moon shaped one that originally belonged to Ma Yichu. It had inscriptions by Chen Tao'an, Zhu Jiangcun, Ma Tongbo, Zhang Taiyan, Yang Yungou, Wu Jiongzhai, Zhu Zhenzhuang, Ma Yifu, and others. Huiwen begged it from Jia Chu, and Yichu generously gave it to him. When Huiwen passed away, his belongings were scattered and lost. Yichu bought it from a merchant, and it was truly a story of the pearl returning to He Pu, especially celebrated in literary circles. Also, Wu Hufan collected fans with calligraphy by Zhuangyuan (top scholars in the imperial examination) from the Qing Dynasty for over two hundred years, accumulating a large volume. Also, Zhuang Tongbai of Changzhou would collect and preserve examples of calligraphy and painting price lists, creating a grand spectacle. Also, Wang Yitang, the owner of the Jin Chuanshi Lou, who was executed, collected dozens of ancient qins (zithers), with jade tuning pegs and gold frets, many of which were fine pieces. Now, I don't know where they have drifted off to, alas.</p>
<h3>On the Sea</h3>
<p>— Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>A ship bound for a certain commercial port left Shanghai.</p>
<p>It was eight o'clock in the morning, and the tall buildings on both sides of the Huangpu River gradually moved backwards. The morning breeze was cool, and the surface of the river was rippling. One could see the green fields of Pudong covered in mist.</p>
<p>But the passengers on board, it seemed, were not in a happy mood. Some had boarded the ship the night before, and although it hadn't sailed, they hadn't slept well. Others were traveling on a small ship, with most of them having bought third-class tickets, and there was no place to sleep. The ship was old, and not very clean. The cabins and aisles were narrow. There was no choice but to find an empty space on the deck, surround it with blankets, and spread out mats and bedding to sleep. This inevitably encroached on or interfered with the sleeping space of others, and there were some who were encroached on or interfered with. At the same time, they had to worry about the large amount of coal ash drifting down from the smokestack, or the sudden rain at night.</p>
<p>Before long, two passengers started arguing under the awning of the aft cabin below. One of them seemed to be a woman, and the other a man. They were probably strangers. A woman chattered incessantly, which angered the man. This kind of quarrel soon subsided naturally. But there were three more incidents on this day. The biggest incident involved a soldier and a middle-aged man, who argued loudly, shouting and cursing, almost coming to blows. I lay in a relatively safe place, listening. Summarizing, I could come to a conclusion that most of the arguments were unnecessary. (1) One of them must have been arrogant, unreasonable, and vulgar, or an unintentional remark was misunderstood by the other party. (2) One party must have not considered the other, or calculated too much for themselves. (3) Due to a restless and impatient mood, people who often argue with others are unable to engage in beneficial thought in their spare time. Dissatisfaction with the environment, restlessness, and free time, like many wild animals locked in a narrow cage, also bite each other. Sometimes, people's unreasonable and unprofitable fights seem to be like that situation.</p>
<p>A whole day and night of strong winds and waves.</p>
<p>All the people on the ship, whether they had vomited or not, were sleeping peacefully and quietly. Thinking about it was funny, at this time no one was angry, and no one wanted to make trouble. No one wanted to eat or drink tea, and there were even no people walking around.</p>
<p>The calm had returned. Two people were sitting next to the ship's railing. One asked the other, "Do you still remember the taste of last night's storm?" The person sitting next to him said, "Really, as soon as the storm subsides, people immediately feel as fresh as if they woke up from a dream. How big was last night's storm? How uncomfortable was it to lie down? It seems I can't remember at all." This sentence is very interesting, and from this, one can infer the weakness of people's memory of suffering. A slave who is freed immediately forgets his inhuman life; a poor person who becomes rich immediately forgets his days of freezing and hunger. Once the flood is over, the impression of the disaster suddenly disappears; once the war is over, the memories of the suffering and misery quickly disappear. People's memories sometimes seem to be rooted in unnecessary things. For example, in Maupassant's story "Martin Baptiste," that kind woman was despised by others throughout her life for something that was not her own fault, and even died for it. That woman was defiled by the male servant when she was a child, so the children would not play with her, the adults would not get close to her, and even after marriage people would not forgive her, letting her die miserably. Here, God seems to have a mysterious arrangement, I don't know why.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Electric Company - Respectfully Responds to Inquiries from Residents of Jinyi Road</h3>
<p>Emergency Repairs Please Call 02-70040 70971</p>
<p>We acknowledge receipt of your department's letter of September 25th, along with an attached letter from residents of Lane 195, Jinyi Road, regarding the emergency repair of the broken power lines at that location after they were struck by lightning at 5:30 PM on September 20th. According to our investigation, at 5:45 PM that afternoon, our company received a phone call from a resident at that location reporting the incident. We immediately contacted the Zhongshan Road transformer substation to have the main switch for that line tripped, which was done at 5:50 PM, as recorded in our records. At the same time, we dispatched employees to rush to the scene for repairs. Due to the travel time by vehicle, they arrived at the location a little after 6:10 PM. According to reports, the downed power lines had been cut by the fire department by thirty to forty feet, indicating that the current had already been cut off; otherwise, they would not have been able to cut the lines. Our company immediately dispatches employees to inspect and repair faulty lines upon discovery and strives to cut off the power supply as much as possible to ensure safety. However, due to the vastness of the power grid, we still rely on the assistance of local residents to report any issues by telephone at any time so that we can rush to the scene for rescue. In the event of such incidents, please call 02-70040 or 70971 directly to report them in order to avoid delays. We hereby reply to your department and respectfully request that this be conveyed to the public. Sincerely, Shanghai China Merchants Electric Co., Ltd., Community Services Department, Shenbao Editorial Department</p>
