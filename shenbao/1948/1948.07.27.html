<p>〔中央社　陽廿六日電〕週來東北局面　益開朗，軍事方面由於遼南戰局之有利開展，已使一　人士對國軍一增加堅强之信念，而士兵射擊之準確，日在此間傳爲傳奇式之佳話，此皆係數月來衛總司令訓士兵射擊之結果。遼陽等地之接收工作，較前已有顯著進步，一切物資皆有適當儲存與保　，而國軍嚴明軍紀，尤予刧後黎庶以莫大安慰。政委會高副主委惜冰已宣佈：東北各省市決於八月一日實施總體戰工作綱領。在今日東北小康局面下，此消息傳出，無論政府與人民均極興奮。總體戰綱領精神，多根據冀察綏方案，惟辦法因情形不同則稍殊。綱領內分軍事。政治·經濟·文化四部門，軍事注重民眾組織，即人民為自身生存而勦匪，以自衛掩護自治推行，以自治加强自衛意識，俾生活與戰鬥，人民與國家，成為血肉不可分之整體。政治注重行政下鄉，人才下鄕，及經濟下鄕，俾政府與人民配合爲」。經濟注重土地改革，即平均人民負担，使當有多担，中產少祖，貧苦不祖。文化注重思想勦匪，使文化下鄉，提高敵　情緒，增强消滅共匪信念，同時全力推行小學教育，遼省王主席鐵漢，於視察各縣歸來困難，且極受歡迎。昨日市府已完成全市馬路修　計劃，尤其　城新建柏油路·下水道·更為創舉。予來此觀光之中外人士以良好印象之市府，為加強基層組織，以防奸防諜，對保長一反　此之任用辦法，而採取考選制度，經過考選之一九四名保長，刻已訓練完成，分配各保服務。董市長並爲澈底肅淸貧汚，對該市所屬之一千五百名員工實施五人連坐辦法。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平廿六日電〕冀主席楚溪春，廿五日在週會時宣述「游剿控制面」戰術。楚氏謂：根據最近冀東平漢北段戰役經驗，證明守點控制面不如「游剿控制面」打擊大。匪配合大部隊作戰，要不死守，一城一地，不犧牲人，不損失槍及物資，最近戰役，淶水，定興，新城，香河，武淸等縣，因戰略關係，都曾一度放棄，均先後收復，以新城的空室淸野做得最好，今後如永保有此等做法，則匪槍枝無從搶，物資亦無處掠刦。氏繼謂：實行游剿戰有三個基本條件：（一）消息　通，以判斷匪情，決定撤或守。（二）空室淸野，使不但士兵撤退，老百姓亦撤退，大量物資運走，小部份食糧用具埋藏，大軍拆卸，分散廠埋，水井掩美國，使匪入城無吃無喝，找不到物資，找不到運具，亦找不到人民。（三）封鎖匪軍，清野之後，立即斷絕行人，不使匪放出一個偵探。楚氏結論謂；這是戰略的轉變，希望人民瞭解，並擁護這種戰法。</p>

<h3 id="c20">農村復興與農業改良 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>最近政府當局對於農業問題，有了深切的注意。地政部積極政力於全般土地改革的研究與計劃，農林部注意於農業推廣的實施，幷計劃以浙江廿五縣爲示範區，辦理現代化的農業推廣輔導。各方論壇近來對於農業科學化問題的注意，已超越了士地改革的技術問題。這是一種進步的現象，不約而同的，認爲農業問題的關鍵，不完全在土地改革和土地分配的問題，它的歸趨仍在農業的改良，效率的提高，生產的增加，使農民完全免於饑饉匱乏，而完全取得合理化的生活水準。這種合理化標準化的農業經濟，我們可稱爲黎民不饑不寒的農業經濟，也是民生主義首先所追求的小康經濟。</p>
<p>我國是農業經濟社會，國家的「安」與「亂」，幾乎全視農業生產是否獲得充分發展，農民生活是否能獲得安居樂業而定。至於要使農業生產發展，不僅要求土地分配平均，並且要求效率提高，生產增加，以補土地所有分配的不足；要使農民生活的安居樂業，不僅要求天災水旱的消滅，兵糧徵發的避免，並且要求永遠有安定的和平的環境。有人以爲解決了士地分配問題，便算解決了農民的問題，這種理論是不健全的，而且也不是健康的農業經濟，這是見山不見林的皮毛之見，從現代經濟觀點來說，這種理論已經迂腐了。</p>
<p>現在，且看我國士地問題的現狀，即可知農業問題的眞正關鍵在那裏？根據確實的估計，我國雖號稱地大物博，但已墾土地面積，仍然是很小的，僅約十三億市畝，佔士地總面積百分之十左右；若以此已墾的土地面積，分攤於三億二千餘萬的農民，每人所得不過三·七五市畝（約合〇·六英畝），與美國伊斯特敎授估計每人維持最低生活所需的二·五英畝比較，相去很遠了。益以年來天災人禍頻仍，連已墾的土地又有不少荒蕪，黃河泛區耕地的僵化即其一例。如就土地與人口的比例來說，顯然是人多地少，統計數字很明白地指出這種「不均」的現象。據一九二七年的統計：三十畝以下的貧農中農，佔總人數的百分之七十九，而其所佔總耕地面積的比例僅百分之十九；三十畝至五十畝的中晨，佔總人數的百分之十六，其所佔鐵耕地面積的比例爲百分之十七，五十畝以上的地主，佔總人數僅百分之十五，而其所佔總耕地面積的比例多至百分之六十二。又據一九三七年中央農業實騐所調查所得：我國自耕農爲百分之四大，半自耕農爲百分之二四，佃農爲百分之三十。經通八年抗戰的結果，自耕優有不少淪落爲半自耕農或佃農，使土地的所有權更形集中，自然這種「不均」的現象，必需要解決分配問題。關於士地分配，民生主義早定了「平均地權」的解決方法，以達「耕者有其田」的目的。可惜政府過去對於士地改革工作未能推行，或是執行得不澈底，甚少效果。例如：過去確認土地丈爲改革土地問題的開端，但是土地淸丈祇在極少縣內舉行；又如推行「二五减租」作爲扶植自耕農的階梯，但「二五减租」直到今日仍未普遍實行，最近湖南農民要求「二五减租」，竟反遭受殺身之禍。足見土地分配問題的解決，今天的阻礙仍然很多，政府在當前旣感共產黨問題的嚴重，應該痛下決心，迅速實行民生主義的土地改革政策，另方面再配合農業經濟的改良與進步，從土地利用問題上，以求我國農業生產之發展和農村經濟的繁榮。</p>
<p>土地的利用，亦即農業生產經營的問題。現代農業生產的發展，舉世已多實行機械化與科學化，在生產技術上，採行集體耕種，在農業經營上，採行大農塲制。我國土地呈現零星與離數的現象，在經營上，可漸進走上大農塲制。本報七月廿三日刋戲蚌埠通信，詳述皖東北（包括五河瓖遠實城三縣）試行農墾機械化，農業科學化，不僅從技術上使用曳引機耕田，成績斐然，爲各地農民所稱羨，並且在經營上，獲得意外的成功，生產增加了，農民團結了，農家小康生活的獲得，完全寄託在農集科學經營的輔導工作上，農民與政府的關係是相依爲命的。農林部最近擬與聯合國和浙江省政府合作，於杭嘉湖寗紹金等廿五縣，辦理現代化的農業推廣，這是推行集體耕種，試行大農塲制的絕好地區。以皖東北試行農耕機械化的經驗來說，農林部如在浙江廿五孫試行這個制度，浙江人民自必報以熱烈的歡迎。希望農林部早日將這巨大計劃，付諸實現！</p>
<p>總之，農業問題是今日我國社會經濟問題中，最感迫切而急待決的問題。也唯有農業改良，效率提高，生產增加，擴大土地利用的效用，纔能够使三億二千餘萬的農民大衆，免於饑饉匱乏，而完全取得合現化的生活　　。我們贊成農業經濟的改良與進步，我國與國際的合作，使農業生產得到充分發展。我們遙矚皖東北農業機械化的日新進步，格外盼望浙江大農場的集體經營之能早日實現！</p>

<h3 id="c66">杜魯門將要求國會有限制管制物資　外交問題可能提出討論　　〔合眾社華盛頓廿六日電〕共和黨控制之八十屆議會，將於今日中午（上海節約時間廿七日上午二時）復會，準備拒絕杜魯門總統關於肉類分配及有限制管制物價等之緊急請求。但共和黨對目前之通貨膨脹以及高物價對總統競選之嚴重威脅，亦深感焦慮。倘杜魯門對渠所應爲者有若干其他意見，共和黨可能加以支持。雖然，杜魯門總統之召開國會緊急會議，僅係考慮國內問題，但外交問題可能亦係因素之一，如柏林局勢愈趨尖銳，則國會無疑將討論外交政策。杜威的智囊團  章礝石譯　　　假如在本年十一月的總統選舉中，杜威和華倫果眞是獲得了勝利，那末，到一九四九年一月二十日，杜成和華倫就可以正式做白宮的正副主人了。政府的組織，也將隨之一新。白宮裏，從之就將移入一羣新的部長，新的秘書，新的顧問和新的智囊團。其他的官員，也將另有一種新的政見。　　當一個握了十六年政權的政黨落選之後，由另一個政黨去而代之，自然不論是執政的人物和政府的態度，都將煥然一新。如果杜威眞是如願以償當選了下屆的總統，我們可以從他的競選綱領中，和以往的記錄裏，推敲出他就任後的政策。　　杜咸當選了總統之後，白宮裏的顧問，大部分將自三四十位人中挑選出來。這所謂的三四十位人物，乃是興他在紐約的時候，接觸最親密者。其中，有幾位可能被挑選組閣，另外的幾位，則祖任一些比較不顯著的事。但是這些人能成爲杜威政權中的智囊團，却是在意測中的。　　關於政治方面的人才，就得提起杜威智囊團中的勃朗尼。他今年考四十四歲，是杜威的法萊“Jim　Farley”。勃朗尼先生也許是共和黨國民委員會的主席，如果共和黨競選獲勝，可能被任命爲杜威政權下的政治人物。做郵務總長，他是很有可能的。自然，當杜咸組閣時，他無疑地是强有力的台柱之一。　　勃朗尼是紙約州的政治老手，他與羅斯福政權的「法萊」略有不同。他是尼勃拉斯加大學出身，所以他是配得上做一般政務的顧問。　　其他可與勃朗尼共事者，計有史勃拉格和賈克爾二位。史勃拉格是紐約的共和黨國民委員會委員，賈克爾是以前紐約州的共和黨主席。這三位先生，將在杜威當選之後，負起艱巨的任務。　　關於外交人才我們就得提起杜爾斯。他今年六十歲，如果杜威當選，他可能就是杜咸政權下的顯著人物之一。杜爾斯先生是紐約的律師，假使他願意從事的話，他是很配做國務卿的。雖然他的政見與馬歇爾有些出入，但是大體上是不會有所改變的。　　提起了杜爾斯，我們又不得不記憶起過去的國際重要會議，和國聯的事，那時，他也是主事人的一個。憑他幾年來的個人經驗，他足够可以與史達林或莫洛托夫折衝樽俎。他可說共和黨外交代表人物中的最重要者。雖然在這幾年中，他是杜威的顧問之一，但是他與國務院和范登堡却保持着密切的關係。如果杜威獲到勝利，杜爾斯—范登堡這一組，便會管制美國與其他各國的關　　關於國內政治的人才，四十五歲的培爾就是在杜威智囊團中最適當的人物之一。他是從前「紐約時報」的財政問題執筆者之一。他也是杜咸州長幾年來心目中的「理想人物」。他是供給杜威演說資料的人物，他是杜成的顧問，常常跟隨着杜威的。　　培爾先生，現在是紐約州銀行界的指揮者，假如他願意去幹的話，當杜咸當選總統之後，可能由他出任財政部長。他的政見，不論是對於經濟或財政，與他接觸過的銀行家和經濟學家，無不讚成的。如果培爾先生不高興担任財長，那末在杜威任內，財政部長可能由傑出的銀行家去担任。像契斯國民銀行的董事長亞爾屈里區就是很有希望的一個。　　在國曾中，杜威政權也極需要相當的人才。這是用以保持國會與白宮關係的。華倫，他正和杜威一樣，是新到華盛頓的人物，所以不甚適當。伊凡斯是紐約籍的上院議員，今年五十二歲，他可能會担任這項艱巨的工作的。因爲他與杜咸是特別接近，他也可能被任命爲勞工部長。但是看上去，他又是很可能留着在參議院裏任駐國會的白宮發言人的。當新政權成立之後，他的新職位也很可能爲貝尼斯所佔，但是杜威下面的人物，却都希望這職位應由伊凡期去担任。（上） <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>

<p>自由談「頭痛醫腳」  吳庸　　當局對於經濟危機，無日不在標本兼治，而終以發行大鈔了事。某一類論客又從而故作欺人之談，說什麼戰前十元法幣値多少，今日的十萬元法幣又能値多少，爲應付現實，五百萬元面額的大票，仍不够靈活地達成鈔券之任務，較關金二十五萬元面額更鉅之鈔券殊有立即發行之需要；又特別指出：大鈔的發行不應該影饗物價，而事實上竟無法避免影響物價者，乃是由於社會一般人心理上的錯覺云云。　　殊不知大鈔之是否足以刺激物價，初非「應該」「不應該」的問題，而純屬事實問題；以過去事實論，大鈔之發行有那一次不曾刺激物價暴升過了？至於「心理錯覺」云云，縱使是「錯覺」，如若社會上大多數人持有這種「心理上的錯覺」，我們就不得不予以重視，予以愼重考慮。例如士氣不振原不過是一種心理作用，試問治軍者是否可以置之不顧？主張發行較二十五萬元關金更鉅面額之鈔券的志士該是沒有「心理上的錯覺」的了，只是聽他說話，却是囤戶口吻。　　說這類話的人只是社會上的少數份子，即所謂有錢點戯的大爺是。凡足以刺激物價暴漲的辦法，於取消限價發行大額鈔券等等，此輩無不事先多方予以曲解，用盡心計促其　現。一旦目的達到，物價上騰，我們隱約可以聞得此輩在幕後的歡欣鼓舞之聲，一如猪玀吃了酒糟，醉飽臥下，作嗯嗯聲然。醒來高興，逢塲作戲，發表些宏論，多方予漲價以原宥，正似隔岸觀火，作逍遙雲端閑眺下界凡世之狀。一遇物價稍平，則先天下而着急，說什麼米價與他物較，委實太廉，長此以往，「毅賤傷農」，天下必坍。某實這一類的人心中只存私人利害之一念，可是說出話來，偏要大談其　應該」「不應該」的是非問題。魯迅說：凡是滿口仁義道德的人，萬萬親近不得。雷馬克也說：憤世嫉俗的人往往有高尙的人格，而理想主義者偏偏是不很可靠的。二者指的大約即是這一類的人。　　現在大鈔是發行了，聞訊得以掩口而笑的只是少數有錢的大爺。可是木已成舟，說也無益。不過總不免希望當局此後萬勿再事倒行逆施，不從平抑物價着手，而專事發行大鈔以迎合物價。尤不宜多發「標本兼治」一類的空論。須知凡事如須「標本兼治」，大約已是病入膏育。今人動輒以「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」一語議政府，而政府亦常以此爲戒，實則頭痛自然只須醫頭，脚痛自然只須醫脚，怕的是「頭痛醫脚」，「脚痛醫頭」耳。汲古閣  錢大成　　汲古閣在常熟迎春門外十餘里之七星橋，明淸之際毛子晋藏書刻書之所也。其藏書刻書源委，葉德輝於「書林淸話」一書中已詳言之，余復爲毛氏父子輯年譜，載於國立中央圖書館館刋。茲述其瑣事。　　汲古閣舊藏朱性甫手稿本「鐵網珊瑚一十四本，子晋當時曾廣徵題咏，其子斧季復以此質人而易人參療疾者。民國初年，忽出現於邑之寺前街蕭儒卿古董肆，儒卿缺鑒別力，遂爲邑人歸止庵以番餅十元易去。止庵因自號寳珊瑚閣主人，作歌以識欣幸；復影印一二葉，以黴名人題咏。此書每葉均有「汲古閣」藏印，止庵乃亦效顰，每葉亦鈐一藏印，遂损色不少。後又質諸邑中沈芳谷家，芳谷子屢邀予往觀，遷延未果，聞今又已易主矣。　　汲古閣後人在七星橋附近業醫者頗夥，不復以藏書名矣。昔歲吾友曹菊生先生訪書隱湖，悉毛氏　書泰半論斤稱出，其子孫竟有嗜賭若命，卜畫卜夜者，故僅得舊抄本「子晋先生行實」及明刋本「將將紀」以歸。然「行實」乃富有汲古閣掌故，予年譜取材于此頗不少。「將將紀」亦不見他家書目著錄，四庫則列入存目，抑亦海內所罕見已。　　當熟城內頗有自稱「汲古閣」後裔者，此猶王氏必自稱「三槐」，陶氏必自稱「五柳」，張氏必自稱「百忍」而已，其譜系未必詳備。然足見子晋藏書，爲人欣慕者若是。　　今之「毛邊紙」「毛太紙」，乃創自毛氏，「毛邊」者，毛氏刻畫所專造之紙也，「毛太」者，毛氏所專造之太字號紙也。　　近人陶蘭泉藏汲古閣所刻書最多，積三十餘年之心力，共得五百四十餘種，然尙未備。余嘗在沈氏希任齋見「江湖散人集」，藏書家鮮有知其名者，亦海內孤本之一。　　汲古閣刻書雖多，但精好者僅史部一二種，集部數種而已。然彼盡售附郭之田，以事剞劂，人議爲好事；余則謂爲勇氣百倍。今之富人有此風致耶？出版事業行且奄奄待斃矣。卽謂之愚，其愚誠不可及也。蜜月並不甜蜜  柳岸　　紐約有兩位著名的社會學家，最近曾向一百位年靑的已婚婦女詢問她們對於蜜月旅行的眞實意見。結果是；五十二位少婦肯定地表示在蜜月中毫不感覺樂趣；二位說蜜月裏的生涯簡眞「可怕」；祗有十七位說她們的蜜月過得很愉快。　　密西西比州社會健康協會也曾舉行相似的測驗，結果是：百分之六十以上的新娘在蜜月旅行中感到苦多樂少。　　主要的原因是：（一）準備婚事已極疲勞，蜜月中原希望可獲休息，不料旅行時實在非常勞頓，於是精神不佳，脾氣大壞；（二）錢化得太多，以致新夫妻大家心事重重，有時爲了要省錢，就鬥起氣來。你失眠嗎？  烟波　　拿破崙在戰績最輝煌的時候，每一畫夜二十四小時以內至多祗睡四五個鐘頭，而在此期間，他無論在體力或知力上，都有驚人的表現。他騎馬巡視前綫時往往一連十個鐘頭不下馬，一回到營裏又馬上和幕僚舉行會議，直到深夜。等到會議完畢，他又呌了書記進來，面授機宜，寫好許多信，仔細審閱，修改，再審閱，然後簽名。天犬如此，從不感覺疲倦。　　但是，後來，滑鐵盧一戰粉碎了他征服全世界的夢想，他被放逐到了寂寞的聖·海倫那島，那時候，他的生活習慣却突然起了極大的變化。以前他祗要睡四五個鐘頭就已足够，現在他幾乎鎭天懶洋洋的無事可做，但夜裏却非睡八九個鐘頭不可了。　　難道工作愈忙　，需要的睡眠時間倒愈少嗎？　　現在的心理學家們竟然說：的確如此。　　他們治療患失眠症的病人時，已經不再專心去敎他們如何「睡着」，而在敎那些病人們在醒的時候好好地工作。醫生們說：祗要人們在工作時能够發生興趣，同時這工作太身又能够增高他們的聲望地位——能使他們覺得自己與衆不同，那麼，無論工作的時間多麼長，睡覺的時候多麼短，全都沒有關係，決不會影響到健康。　　據說有一位賭客，在贏錢的時候可以一連幾天幾夜不睡，照樣精神極好；如果賭遝忽轉，反勝爲敗，仙就非馬上去連睡十幾個　頭不可。賭錢固然不是「工作」，但一個人的心境和睡覺的關係，却就可見一斑了。　　有人曾去訪問大發明家愛迪生，愛迪生發表了這樣的宏論：　　他說：睡覺實在祗是一種毫無道理的壞習慣。我們雖然一時還不能改掉，但慢慢地總會改掉的。一般人每天睡八九個鐘頭之多，結果是反而常常會感覺疲勞。其實，人類根本無需睡覺；將來大家睡覺的時候一定比現在要短得多——正如現在我們睡覺的時候已比我們的祖先們大大减少一樣。以前的人們日出而作，日入而息，當然睡的時候比我們長。我相信在一百萬年以後，大家可以根本不需要床了。　　愛迪生的話也許有些過火，不過他自已的確言行相符，把睡覺這個「壞習慣」减少到了最低的限度。　　歷史上著名的人物中，如勳業蓋世的腓特立大帝，如德國大詩人席勒，如著名的物理學大家洪巴爾德，如英國外科醫生的權威亨透，如德國病理學大家菲爾黑等人，他們都是事務極忙碌的，而每天大家都祗睡四五個鐘頭　　所謂一八小時睡眠」這句話，是引的英國古代阿爾弗來德大帝說過的話。人們因爲阿爾弗來德是一個聰明才智的好皇帝，就覺得他說的話就總不會錯了。却不知這句話是引述的時候弄錯的，他說的是：「三分之一的日子，用來吃東西，睡覺，運動。」意思是這三件事情所費的時候加起來，應當是一天的三分之一。這樣說法並不是曲解，阿爾弗來德自己睡覺的時候，每夜從來沒有超過六小時的。　　失眠又有什麼要緊？也許，天下根本就沒有「失眠」這樣一種病症呢！米鹽  公孫午　　計口授糧，幾何始爲足食，余無所知；今食物以熟量計算，自有科學方法在，非專家何可妄論。孟子，王制謂卿祿四大夫，大夫食七十二人，卿食二百八十八人。章太炎云，「古一升當今二合，周禮，上年人食二石五斗六升，一爲三十石七斗二升，當今六石一斗四升四勺也，兼有麻豆在內，故得此數。」古人食量若是之大乎。鹽運至淸道光十一年，以每引四百斤爲定額。林則徐云「每人日食鹽三錢，每引四百斤之鹽，足供六十人終年之食。」三錢之估計或不謬也。近見一機關職員伙食單，民國三十七年一二兩月結算，共食者約五十人，每人日食米七合六勺，豆油七錢，醬油八錢二分，鹽四錢四分。此機關在上海，其時上海米價每石約二百五十萬元，物價如此，斷無浪費之理，故可信。其衡量則用今之市用制。有鼠來窺閣雜筆禹壽  禹壽　　吳清源　　中央社東京電吿：吳淸源方與日本棋聖本因坊秀哉角，已勝一局，此報道殊未詳盡，且亦有史實上之錯誤，如謂淸源二十年前在北京由秀哉携赴日本，並侈陳淸源之得入棋院皆秀哉力，而不知適與事實相反也。　　淸源爲閩人吳玉龍子，玉龍則舊日北京之部曹，亦能弈，而不工，淸源九歲即以弈事　衆，十三歲成名。玉龍旋侘傺死，家益艱苦，母命禮顧水如爲寄父，從水如遊於段合肥之門，月得膏火銀百圓。合肥敗，淸源殊徬徨。日本七段高手　越　作，以棋院命，召之赴日，許其母兄同往，一切用費，由日本財閥大倉負担，與本因坊秀哉無涉。且淸源初入棋院，　越力主授與三段，秀哉猶以爲僭，僅許初段，合議時爭辯甚烈，迺由秀哉面試三局，兩局授二子，一局授三子，淸源以飄逸簡切之新戰法，三挫秀哉，名義遂定。秀哉出身爲魚販，粗鹵不學，性又褊狹，以淸源甫抵日，即納　灝越門稱弟子，而不從己，深以爲恨，故百計撓之。中央社記者謂淸源在日本之成就皆出於秀哉之識拔，誠誤解歷史之至矣。　　民國二十三年，淸源在東京與秀哉正式相撲，雖以兩目之差而敗，顧其戰法新穎，落子敏速，意氣安詳，似顯無其有高度之修養，日本輿論至許爲斷代之高手。實則淸源幼年失學，舍圍棋外無所知，惟性情篤厚，不好矜伐，故尙能予人以純謹之感。　　十年以來，淸源在日本，被稱爲無敵之黑執手，以任何人與角，皆無充分之把握可授以一先也。秀哉漸老憊，自亦不能例外，中央社記者謂甫鬥吳已勝一，殊可信。萊陽梨  竹影　　萊陽梨爲山東萊陽縣之特產，與肥城之桃，樂陵之棗，同稱佳品。梨大者重一斤五六兩，小者每斤可稱三二枚，實作長圓形，皮色靑綠而粗劣。其細嫩而色淡味濃香者，非正產也。皮上有金色細點者，最淸甜而適口，無渣滓，無香氣，中秋節後，梨即下樹。　　梨樹春末着花，白色，其瓣五，蒂甚長，如白海棠然。當着花時，滿樹堆銀，花氣馥郁醉人，東風起處，黃蜂成羣，　繞樹間，恒終宵不去，與梨實不無損傷。梨樹又易生虫，業梨者僱工終日在樹下捕蜂捉蟲，爲狀至勞　　樹不甚高大，粗可一圍，幹長不過三四尺，團團如車蓋。花落後，實漸長漸大，果纍纍，枝條下墜及地，隨手可摘。　　樹接後五六年，即能結果，迨十七八年後，漸結漸少；在十年前後，結實最旺。　　萊陽農人，多植梨爲業，以博厚利。萊邑四鄉梨樹成林，城東南二十里一帶烏龍河河套沙土地方，所產尤佳，方爲眞正之萊陽梨。然其地不過十數畝云。</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 7:00 PM on the 26th] President Chiang's wife arrived at Zhujiqiao Airport in Hangzhou at 5:30 PM on the 26th. Those present to welcome her included Tang Enbo, Director of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters; Chairman Chen Yi; Mayor Zhou Xiangxian; Principal Hu Weike of the Air Force School; and President Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo. The President wore a summer cloth gown, while his wife wore a white-based floral qipao, and both looked extremely energetic. After disembarking, they shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcoming officials, then took a car to Mogan Mountain to rest. Chiang Ching-kuo had arrived in Hangzhou earlier this morning to make arrangements. He did not mention the President's whereabouts to visiting relatives and friends, so apart from the aforementioned few high-ranking officials, no one here knew of the President's arrival.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 11:00 PM] President and Mrs. Chiang, accompanied by Mayor Zhou and Chiang Ching-kuo, went up Mogan Mountain and arrived at the foot of the mountain at 7:20 PM, reaching the summit at 8:20 PM. They immediately rested at the residence of a Mr. Chen of the Shanghai banking community, located at No. 555 Mogan Mountain. Due to the late hour, the President did not tour the mountain. All the attendants stayed overnight on the mountain. It is said that the President's trip is purely for summer retreat, with a stay of several days planned, and he is very pleased with the facilities on Mogan Mountain.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 26th] The President and his wife left Nanjing by special plane at 2:30 PM on the 26th, flying to Hangzhou and then proceeding to Mogan Mountain for a few days of summer vacation. This is the President's first visit to Mogan Mountain after the victory. Accompanying him are Yu Jishi, Cao Shengfen, and others.</p>
<p>[Our News] Mrs. Chiang came to Shanghai earlier this month to rest and recuperate, keeping to herself and rarely interacting with the outside world. It is now learned that Mrs. Chiang returned to Nanjing by special plane on the afternoon of the previous day (the 24th), accompanied by her guard, Zhang Yongliang, and others.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 26th] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi flew to Nanjing this morning for official business, accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Zhao Yuan and others.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 26th] General Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Central China, was summoned by the President and arrived in Nanjing by special plane at noon around 12:00 PM. After disembarking, Bai drove directly to the official residence on Huangpu Road to meet with the President, report on the current situation of bandit suppression in Central China, and seek instructions from the President. The meeting lasted for over forty minutes. After respectfully listening to the President's instructions, Bai left around 1:00 PM and returned to his private residence in Yongyuan, Dabeixiang, to rest. Bai's trip to Nanjing was decided this morning, and it was kept confidential beforehand, so few people knew of his arrival, and his friends were unable to welcome him at the airport. Around 4:00 PM, Gu Zhutong visited Bai, and at 5:00 PM, Minister He Yingqin also paid a visit, engaging in a long conversation for about an hour. At 8:00 PM in the evening, Qin Decun, Liu Shiyi, Wan Yaohuang, and others visited. Bai is expected to stay for several days. Zhao Yuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and Yang Shouqiong, Deputy Director of the Office, also arrived in Nanjing on the same plane.

<h3 id="e3">Situation in Northeast China Becoming Increasingly Clear; Overall War Program to be Implemented Next Month; Shenyang City Government Thoroughly Eliminates Corruption and Implements Collective Responsibility <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] The situation in Northeast China has become increasingly clear in the past week. In military terms, the favorable development of the Liaonan war situation has increased the confidence of some people in the national army, and the accuracy of the soldiers' shooting has become a legendary tale here. This is the result of Commander Wei's training of soldiers in shooting over the past few months. The reception work in Liaoyang and other places has made significant progress compared to the past, with all materials properly stored and protected. The strict military discipline of the national army has provided great comfort to the people after the disaster. Gao Xibing, Deputy Director of the Political Committee, has announced that the provinces and cities in Northeast China will implement the Overall War Program on August 1st. Under the current relatively well-off situation in Northeast China, this news has greatly excited both the government and the people. The spirit of the Overall War Program is mostly based on the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan plan, but the methods are slightly different due to different circumstances. The program is divided into four departments: military, political, economic, and cultural. The military focuses on mass organization, that is, the people suppressing bandits for their own survival, promoting self-defense, covering autonomy, and strengthening the awareness of autonomy, so that life and combat, people and the country, become an inseparable whole. Politics focuses on administration going to the countryside, talent going to the countryside, and economy going to the countryside, so that the government and the people cooperate. Economy focuses on land reform, that is, equalizing the burden of the people, so that those who have more pay more, the middle class pays less, and the poor pay nothing. Culture focuses on ideological bandit suppression, so that culture goes to the countryside, enhances the anti-enemy sentiment, enhances the belief in eliminating the Communist bandits, and at the same time fully promotes primary school education. Wang Tiehan, Chairman of Liaoning Province, has returned from inspecting various counties, facing difficulties but being extremely popular. Yesterday, the city government completed the city-wide road repair plan, especially the newly built asphalt roads and sewers in the urban area, which is an innovation. In order to strengthen the grassroots organization, prevent spies, the mayor of the city, Dong, has reversed the previous method of appointing Bao chiefs and adopted an examination system. The 194 Bao chiefs who have passed the examination are now trained and assigned to serve in various Bao. In order to thoroughly eliminate corruption, Mayor Dong implemented a five-person collective responsibility system for the 1,500 employees of the city.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chu Xichun Describes Guerrilla Control Surface Tactics at Weekly Meeting <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] Chairman of Hebei Province, Chu Xichun, announced "Guerrilla Control Surface" tactics at the weekly meeting on the 25th. Chu stated that based on the recent experience in the battle of the northern section of the Hebei-Beijing Railway in eastern Hebei, it proves that defending points to control the surface is not as effective as "Guerrilla Control Surface" in striking the enemy. When bandits coordinate with large units for combat, they must not defend to the death, sacrificing a city or a piece of land, without sacrificing people or losing guns and supplies. In the recent battles, Lai Shui, Ding Xing, Xin Cheng, Xiang He, Wu Qing, and other counties were abandoned once due to strategic reasons, but they were all recovered later. Xin Cheng's practice of clearing the fields and houses was the best. If this method can be maintained in the future, the bandits will have no way to seize weapons or loot supplies. Chu continued, stating that there are three basic conditions for implementing guerrilla warfare: (1) Information is unobstructed to judge the enemy's situation and decide whether to retreat or defend. (2) Clearing the fields and houses, so that not only the soldiers retreat, but also the people retreat, a large amount of materials are transported away, a small amount of food and utensils are buried, and the large armies are dismantled and buried separately. The wells are covered to prevent the enemy from having food and drink when entering the city, and from finding supplies, vehicles, or people. (3) Blockading the bandit army, immediately cutting off pedestrians after clearing the fields, preventing the bandits from sending out a scout. Chu concluded that this is a strategic shift, and he hopes that the people will understand and support this tactic.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A government military spokesperson told the United Press on the 26th that the Chinese Communist Party has moved its political and military nerve center to Mount Wutai in Shanxi Province, replacing Yan'an, which has served as the Communist Party headquarters for twelve years. The spokesperson said that Communist leaders Mao Zedong and bandit army commander Zhu De are both in Mount Wutai, but they often go to southern Shanxi to guide party affairs and military operations. Mount Wutai is seventy miles from Taiyuan and is one of the four major Buddhist holy sites in the country. Since the Communist Party occupied it, all temples have been converted into training camps, schools, barracks, and dormitories, and all nuns have been forced to return to secular life and marry.</p>

<p>[Our Xuzhou Correspondent, 26th] The 3rd, 8th, and 11th columns of Chen bandits and part of the 4th column, which had fled south in the Yongcheng and Guoyang areas on the border of Henan and Anhui provinces, turned westward on the 25th.

<h3 id="e10">Thirteen Bandit Spies Executed in Taiyuan Yesterday <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th] The Garrison Headquarters executed thirteen bandit spy criminals this afternoon in accordance with the Emergency Penal Regulations for Endangering the State during the Suppression Period. Among them, eight criminals including Zhang Ding, Ding Su'e, Song Wenbing, Hu Ke,周一清, Qiao Yu, and乔有章 sneaked into the city after the Communist bandits disturbed the outskirts of Taiyuan, or wore our army's uniforms, posing as our cadres, or disguised themselves as vendors, secretly engaging in activities, attempting to incite the citizens, and plotting riots. Four criminals, including Wan Chunren, Wen Qing, Li Guangdou, and Qi Fubi, were our cadres who had been captured by bandits and then放回. After receiving tasks from the rebel bandits, they secretly returned, did not report to the competent authority, and secretly engaged in activities, spreading rumors and plotting wrongdoing. Another criminal, Wang Jingting, a member of the Communist bandit party, served in the Northwest Industrial Construction Company, promoting for the bandits and confusing people. All were proved clear after interrogation, and submitted to Director Yan for approval to carry out the death penalty.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Method of Selecting Supervisory Commissioners for Administrative Offices; Supervisory Yuan Discussed All Day; Final Decision to be Made at Today's Meeting <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 26th] The Supervisory Yuan held its 25th meeting at 9:45 AM on the 26th, chaired by President Yu. First, the Secretariat read the minutes of the previous meeting and Tian Jiongjin's original presentation requesting resignation from the position of Supervisory Commissioner to assume the position of Minister of Examination. Then, the discussion began on the draft method for selecting Supervisory Commissioners for Administrative Offices (the full text of which has been seen in today's newspaper). First, Li Zhengle, Chairman of the Drafting Committee, reported on the drafting process, followed by various members expressing their opinions. This discussion had no concrete results until 11:00 AM. Finally, Chen Darong, Gao Dengting, and others separately proposed two temporary motions. Chen Darong's motion was: "It is proposed to organize inspection groups in advance to go to various provinces for inspection in order to strengthen the effectiveness of supervision." Gao Dengting's motion was: "The organization of administrative offices in various districts should wait until the regulations are revised." The presentation of these two cases was because some people believed that the administrative office organization regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan were greatly different from the draft proposed by the Supervisory Yuan, among which the avoidance of native origin was the most important. They unanimously believed that if the principle of avoiding native origin must be followed, there would be no one familiar with the local situation, and the exercise of power would be greatly hindered. Under the circumstances of dissatisfaction with these organizational regulations, there was a proposal to postpone the establishment of administrative offices. At the same time, this opinion was sent to the President, requesting the Legislative Yuan to reconsider. During the reconsideration period, inspection groups should be organized first to exercise power. However, during the discussion, some people also believed that the Supervisory Yuan should comply with the laws and regulations and form administrative offices in accordance with the organizational regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan. If obstacles occur after implementation, they should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration and revision. This discussion was submitted to a vote this morning and has been decided to be discussed finally at the 26th meeting on the 27th. According to today's discussion, there were still a majority of people who believed that it was really inappropriate to list the Mongolian Administrative Office in the organizational regulations, and their speeches were fierce. Secondly, some people advocated that administrative offices and inspection groups should be organized and established at the same time. In short, general opinions are very important to the organization of administrative offices, because they are the basic conditions for the exercise of supervisory power.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Sun Du Has Been Ill and Has Not Yet Taken Office; Rehe Provincial Politics Unattended; Supervisory Commissioner Submits a Corrective Case Requesting the Reassignment of Cadres to Preside <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 26th] The newly appointed Chairman of Rehe Province, Sun Du, came to Ping from Jin on the 24th and immediately fell ill (reportedly a stroke). He will not be able to go to Chengde to take office in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 26th] The situation in Rehe Province is still at a critical stage. Chairman Sun Du has not yet taken office more than a month after being appointed, and provincial politics are unattended, almost becoming a vacuum. People in Rehe Province have recently sent letters to the Supervisory Commissioners here, asking them to appeal on their behalf. Supervisory Commissioner卢凤阁 has submitted a corrective case to the Supervisory Yuan, "Requesting the government to quickly reassign cadres to preside over Rehe provincial politics, to save the current crisis, to protect the key area of national defense, and to comfort the feelings of the people." The reasons for this are: The government announced Sun Du as the Chairman of Rehe Province on June 22nd, but he has not taken office for more than a month, and the former Chairman, Fan Hanjie, is fully engaged in military affairs and no longer cares about the provincial government, resulting in the stagnation of provincial politics and the anxiety of the people, which not only affects the morale of the people, but also makes the overall situation in North China insecure. This is one reason. Rehe Province is an important place for national defense, and its gains and losses are of great importance to the safety of the Northeast and North China. Now, the situation in Chengde is isolated, and there is a shortage of food, which originally relied on airlift. The stability of people's hearts depends entirely on the immediate presence of the presiding officer. Now, Sun Du has not taken office for more than a month after being appointed. According to the regulations of the Civil Service Service Law, he should take office within one month after receiving the appointment letter. Now Sun is overdue and has not arrived, and he has failed in his responsibility. The government should re-select cadres to serve as the chairman of Rehe, in order to stabilize the people's hearts. The case will be brought up for discussion in advance at the meeting on the 27th.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Kuomintang Central Committee department heads held their second meeting at 10:00 AM on the 26th to discuss party reform issues. Chairman Wu Tiecheng presided. First, Hong Lanyou presented the opinions drafted by a subcommittee regarding improvements to party affairs for discussion and decision. Attendees spoke enthusiastically, with most expressing opinions on the lack of coordination between the party and the government. No concrete conclusions were reached on the principles proposed by Hong. It is reported that this meeting of department heads is scheduled to reconvene on the 28th. The party reform plan will be drafted only after the results of the department heads' meeting are discussed, then submitted to the President for review, and then submitted to the upcoming party affairs review conference for discussion. It is said that Hong's opinions, presented at today's meeting, are divided into twelve items, none of which are decisive. The general principles are divided into sections such as organization, policy, discipline, and activities. Regarding the organization section, the question is whether it should be streamlined or expanded, whether it should be generated by elections or remain top-down, and whether personnel should be changed. Regarding the policy section, major issues such as foreign policy will not be changed. During the discussion, some people raised the issue of the coordination between party members in the government and the party. In the future, it is essential to achieve coordination and implement the party's decisions. Regarding discipline, the question is how to ensure that party members abide by party discipline and how to coordinate the party and the government, and the party and its affiliated organizations. Other issues include the organization of party members and the organization of the central party headquarters.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The convening of the Kuomintang Party Affairs Review Conference was decided at the Central Committee Department Heads Meeting on the 26th. (1) The location is Nanjing. (2) The time is early next month (originally scheduled for the 29th, but it is likely too late because the reform plan is not yet complete). (3) Attendees will include standing members of the Central Committee in Nanjing, heads of central departments and commissions, and Kuomintang members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan. The review will likely involve a broad discussion. It is also learned that, in addition to discussing the party reform plan, the review will also address the overall war plan and the party-affiliated organizations unification plan. The conference will seek to achieve a concrete reform plan as an important guideline for future party affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Kuomintang's Party Affairs Review Conference will decide on the most significant issues of innovation in party affairs. The Kuomintang Central Committee has also decided to submit the concrete reform plan it achieves at the review conference to the Party's Seventh Plenary Session or the National Congress for final decision. President Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet at his official residence on the 26th for Kuomintang party members in the government and heads of central organs and ministries. He solemnly pointed out that the current innovation movement is the party's last chance, with success as the only option. He hoped that everyone would discuss reform ideas in advance outside the meeting. Wu Tiecheng then gave a speech, after which the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Rural Revival and Agricultural Improvement <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the government authorities have paid close attention to the agricultural issue. The Ministry of Land Affairs is actively focusing its efforts on the research and planning of comprehensive land reform, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is paying attention to the implementation of agricultural extension, and plans to take 25 counties in Zhejiang as demonstration areas to carry out modernized agricultural extension guidance. In recent forums, attention to the issue of agricultural science has surpassed the technical issues of land reform. This is a progressive phenomenon, and it is unanimously believed that the key to the agricultural issue does not lie entirely in land reform and land distribution, but rather in agricultural improvement, increased efficiency, and increased production, so that farmers are completely free from hunger and poverty, and completely obtain a reasonable standard of living. This kind of rationalized and standardized agricultural economy, we can call it an agricultural economy where the people are not hungry or cold, which is also the Xiaokang economy first pursued by the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>China is an agricultural economic society, and the "peace" and "chaos" of the country almost entirely depend on whether agricultural production can be fully developed and whether farmers' lives can be peaceful and prosperous. As for making agricultural production develop, it not only requires equal land distribution, but also requires increased efficiency and increased production to make up for the insufficiency of land ownership distribution; to make farmers' lives peaceful and prosperous, it not only requires the elimination of natural disasters such as floods and droughts and the avoidance of conscription of soldiers and grain, but also requires a permanently stable and peaceful environment. Some people think that solving the land distribution problem is the same as solving the farmers' problem. This theory is unsound and not a healthy agricultural economy. This is a superficial view that only sees the mountain and not the forest. From a modern economic point of view, this theory is already outdated.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the current situation of the land problem in China to see where the real key to the agricultural problem lies. According to reliable estimates, although China is known as a vast country with abundant resources, the area of cultivated land is still very small, only about 1.3 billion mu, accounting for about 10% of the total land area; if this cultivated land area is distributed among more than 320 million farmers, each person will get only 3.75 mu (about 0.6 acres), which is very different from the 2.5 acres estimated by Professor East of the United States as the minimum requirement for maintaining life. In addition, natural disasters and man-made disasters have been frequent in recent years, and much of the cultivated land has been abandoned, and the stagnation of farmland in the Yellow River flood area is one example. In terms of the ratio of land to population, it is obvious that there are more people than land, and the statistics clearly point out this "unequal" phenomenon. According to the statistics in 1927, poor and middle peasants with less than 30 mu accounted for 79% of the total population, while the proportion of total cultivated land area they occupied was only 19%; middle peasants with 30 to 50 mu accounted for 16% of the total population, and the proportion of cultivated land area they occupied was 17%; landlords with more than 50 mu accounted for only 15% of the total population, and the proportion of total cultivated land area they occupied was as high as 62%. According to the survey conducted by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute in 1937, self-cultivating farmers accounted for 4%, semi-self-cultivating farmers accounted for 24%, and tenant farmers accounted for 30%. As a result of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, many self-cultivating farmers have fallen into semi-self-cultivating farmers or tenant farmers, making the ownership of land more concentrated. Naturally, this "unequal" phenomenon must be resolved by distribution. Regarding land distribution, the Principle of People's Livelihood has long established the solution of "equalization of land rights" to achieve the goal of "land to the tiller". Unfortunately, the government has failed to promote land reform in the past, or the implementation has not been thorough enough, and there has been little effect. For example, in the past, confirming the land measurement was regarded as the beginning of reforming the land problem, but land measurement was only held in a very small number of counties; another example is the promotion of "25% rent reduction" as a step to support self-cultivating farmers, but "25% rent reduction" has not been universally implemented to this day. Recently, farmers in Hunan demanded "25% rent reduction" and were killed as a result. It can be seen that the solution to the land distribution problem still faces many obstacles today. Since the government is currently feeling the seriousness of the Communist Party problem, it should make a painful decision and quickly implement the land reform policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood. On the other hand, it should also cooperate with the improvement and progress of the agricultural economy, and seek the development of agricultural production and the prosperity of the rural economy from the land utilization problem.</p>
<p>The utilization of land is also the problem of agricultural production and management. The development of modern agricultural production has been widely mechanized and scientificized around the world. In terms of production technology, collective cultivation is adopted, and in terms of agricultural management, large-scale farms are adopted. The phenomenon of fragmentation and dispersion of land in China can gradually move towards large-scale farms in management. This newspaper published a communication from Bengbu on July 23, detailing the trial of agricultural mechanization and agricultural science in northeastern Anhui (including the three counties of Wuhe, Xiangyuan, and Shicheng). Not only did it use tractors to cultivate fields from a technical point of view, with remarkable results, which were admired by farmers everywhere, but it also achieved unexpected success in management. Production increased, farmers were united, and the achievement of a well-off life for farmers' families was entirely entrusted to the guidance of agricultural science and management. The relationship between farmers and the government is interdependent. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently plans to cooperate with the United Nations and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to carry out modernized agricultural extension in 25 counties, including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua. This is an excellent area to promote collective cultivation and experiment with large-scale farms. Taking the experience of the trial of agricultural mechanization in northeastern Anhui as an example, if the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry tries this system in the 25 counties of Zhejiang, the people of Zhejiang will certainly respond with warm welcome. It is hoped that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will implement this huge plan as soon as possible!</p>
<p>In short, the agricultural problem is the most pressing and urgent problem among the socio-economic problems in China today. Only through agricultural improvement, increased efficiency, increased production, and expanded land utilization can more than 320 million farmers be freed from hunger and poverty and completely obtain a reasonable life. We support the improvement and progress of the agricultural economy, and the cooperation between China and other countries, so that agricultural production can be fully developed. We look forward to the daily progress of agricultural mechanization in northeastern Anhui, and we especially hope that the collective operation of large-scale farms in Zhejiang can be realized as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Opium Dealers Buy Machinery and Bullets in Exchange for Opium</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] In recent weeks, price fluctuations in Ya'an, Western Sichuan, have been severe, with average prices rising by 80%. Clear oil costs 500,000 per jin, and rice costs 4.8 million per dou. The local government has not regulated dozens of underground banks, so a large amount of floating capital is being absorbed to scramble for goods. However, because Ya'an has limited resources, deposits are being transferred to Chengdu and Chongqing, estimated at about 300 billion. In addition, newly harvested opium has been put on the market in Tianquan, Lushan, Baoxing, Maogong and other places, and opium dealers are using grain, machinery and bullets to trade for opium. The supply of rice in Ya'an relies on the supply from Mingshan and other places, but more than 10,000 shi of grain were destroyed by fire in Mingshan, so under the circumstances that various opium dealers are snapping up and exchanging opium, rice is even more scarce, which has a great impact on public security. The Pacification Commissioner's Office reported to the Sichuan Provincial Government on the 26th, requesting that it quickly devise a method to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>The 80th Congress, controlled by the Republican Party, will reconvene at noon today (Shanghai savings time 2 a.m. on the 27th) and prepare to reject President Truman's emergency requests regarding meat allocation and limited price controls.</p>
<p>但共和黨對目前之通貨膨脹以及高物價對總統競選之嚴重威脅，亦深感焦慮。</p>

<p>杜威的智囊團  章礝石譯</p>
<p>Dewey's Brain Trust Translated by Zhang Yunshi</p>
<p>假如在本年十一月的總統選舉中，杜威和華倫果眞是獲得了勝利，那末，到一九四九年一月二十日，杜成和華倫就可以正式做白宮的正副主人了。</p>
<p>If Dewey and Warren were to win the presidential election this November, then on January 20, 1949, Dewey and Warren could officially become the master and deputy master of the White House.</p>
<p>政府的組織，也將隨之一新。</p>
<p>The organization of the government will also be renewed accordingly.</p>
<p>白宮裏，從之就將移入一羣新的部長，新的秘書，新的顧問和新的智囊團。</p>
<p>A group of new ministers, new secretaries, new advisors, and new brain trusts will move into the White House.</p>
<p>其他的官員，也將另有一種新的政見。</p>
<p>Other officials will also have a new kind of political view.</p>
<p>當一個握了十六年政權的政黨落選之後，由另一個政黨去而代之，自然不論是執政的人物和政府的態度，都將煥然一新。</p>
<p>When a party that has held power for sixteen years loses an election and is replaced by another party, naturally, both the ruling figures and the government's attitude will be completely renewed.</p>
<p>如果杜威眞是如願以償當選了下屆的總統，我們可以從他的競選綱領中，和以往的記錄裏，推敲出他就任後的政策。</p>
<p>If Dewey truly achieves his wish and is elected as the next president, we can deduce his policies after taking office from his campaign platform and past record.</p>
<p>杜咸當選了總統之後，白宮裏的顧問，大部分將自三四十位人中挑選出來。</p>
<p>After Durham is elected president, most of the advisors in the White House will be selected from thirty to forty people.</p>
<p>這所謂的三四十位人物，乃是興他在紐約的時候，接觸最親密者。</p>
<p>These so-called thirty to forty people are those who had the closest contact with him when he was in New York.</p>
<p>其中，有幾位可能被挑選組閣，另外的幾位，則祖任一些比較不顯著的事。</p>
<p>Among them, some may be selected to form a cabinet, while others will assume some less prominent positions.</p>
<p>但是這些人能成爲杜威政權中的智囊團，却是在意測中的。</p>
<p>However, it is expected that these people will become the brain trust in Dewey's regime.</p>
<p>關於政治方面的人才，就得提起杜威智囊團中的勃朗尼。</p>
<p>Regarding political talents, we must mention Brownell in Dewey's brain trust.</p>
<p>他今年考四十四歲，是杜威的法萊“Jim　Farley”。</p>
<p>He is forty-four years old this year and is Dewey's Farley "Jim Farley".</p>
<p>勃朗尼先生也許是共和黨國民委員會的主席，如果共和黨競選獲勝，可能被任命爲杜威政權下的政治人物。</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell may be the chairman of the Republican National Committee. If the Republican Party wins the election, he may be appointed as a political figure under the Dewey regime.</p>
<p>做郵務總長，他是很有可能的。</p>
<p>He is very likely to become the Postmaster General.</p>
<p>自然，當杜咸組閣時，他無疑地是强有力的台柱之一。</p>
<p>Naturally, when Durham forms a cabinet, he is undoubtedly one of the strong pillars.</p>
<p>勃朗尼是紙約州的政治老手，他與羅斯福政權的「法萊」略有不同。</p>
<p>Brownell is a political veteran in New York State, and he is slightly different from Roosevelt's "Farley."</p>
<p>他是尼勃拉斯加大學出身，所以他是配得上做一般政務的顧問。</p>
<p>He is a graduate of the University of Nebraska, so he is worthy of being an advisor for general political affairs.</p>
<p>其他可與勃朗尼共事者，計有史勃拉格和賈克爾二位。</p>
<p>Others who can work with Brownell include Sprague and Jackel.</p>
<p>史勃拉格是紐約的共和黨國民委員會委員，賈克爾是以前紐約州的共和黨主席。</p>
<p>Sprague is a member of the Republican National Committee of New York, and Jackel is the former Republican chairman of New York State.</p>
<p>這三位先生，將在杜威當選之後，負起艱巨的任務。</p>
<p>These three gentlemen will assume arduous tasks after Dewey is elected.</p>
<p>關於外交人才我們就得提起杜爾斯。</p>
<p>Regarding diplomatic talents, we must mention Dulles.</p>
<p>他今年六十歲，如果杜威當選，他可能就是杜咸政權下的顯著人物之一。</p>
<p>He is sixty years old this year. If Dewey is elected, he may be one of the prominent figures under the Durham regime.</p>
<p>杜爾斯先生是紐約的律師，假使他願意從事的話，他是很配做國務卿的。</p>
<p>Mr. Dulles is a lawyer in New York. If he is willing to engage in it, he is very suitable to be the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>雖然他的政見與馬歇爾有些出入，但是大體上是不會有所改變的。</p>
<p>Although his political views are somewhat different from Marshall's, they will not change much in general.</p>
<p>提起了杜爾斯，我們又不得不記憶起過去的國際重要會議，和國聯的事，那時，他也是主事人的一個。</p>
<p>Speaking of Dulles, we cannot help but recall the important international conferences of the past and the affairs of the League of Nations, when he was also one of the main persons in charge.</p>
<p>憑他幾年來的個人經驗，他足够可以與史達林或莫洛托夫折衝樽俎。</p>
<p>With his personal experience over the years, he is fully capable of negotiating with Stalin or Molotov.</p>
<p>他可說共和黨外交代表人物中的最重要者。</p>
<p>He can be said to be the most important figure among the Republican diplomatic representatives.</p>
<p>雖然在這幾年中，他是杜威的顧問之一，但是他與國務院和范登堡却保持着密切的關係。</p>
<p>Although he has been one of Dewey's advisors in recent years, he has maintained close relations with the State Department and Vandenberg.</p>
<p>如果杜威獲到勝利，杜爾斯—范登堡這一組，便會管制美國與其他各國的關</p>
<p>If Dewey wins, the Dulles-Vandenberg group will control the relationship between the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>關於國內政治的人才，四十五歲的培爾就是在杜威智囊團中最適當的人物之一。</p>
<p>Regarding domestic political talents, 45-year-old Beale is one of the most suitable figures in Dewey's brain trust.</p>
<p>他是從前「紐約時報」的財政問題執筆者之一。</p>
<p>He was formerly one of the writers on financial issues for "The New York Times".</p>
<p>他也是杜咸州長幾年來心目中的「理想人物」。</p>
<p>He has also been the "ideal figure" in the mind of Governor Durham for several years.</p>
<p>他是供給杜威演說資料的人物，他是杜成的顧問，常常跟隨着杜威的。</p>
<p>He is the person who supplies Dewey with speech materials. He is Dewey's advisor and often accompanies Dewey.</p>
<p>培爾先生，現在是紐約州銀行界的指揮者，假如他願意去幹的話，當杜咸當選總統之後，可能由他出任財政部長。</p>
<p>Mr. Beale is now the commander of the banking industry in New York State. If he is willing to do it, he may be appointed as the Secretary of the Treasury after Durham is elected president.</p>
<p>他的政見，不論是對於經濟或財政，與他接觸過的銀行家和經濟學家，無不讚成的。</p>
<p>His political views, whether on economics or finance, are approved by the bankers and economists he has contacted.</p>
<p>如果培爾先生不高興担任財長，那末在杜威任內，財政部長可能由傑出的銀行家去担任。</p>
<p>If Mr. Beale is not happy to serve as the Secretary of the Treasury, then during Dewey's tenure, the Secretary of the Treasury may be served by an outstanding banker.</p>
<p>像契斯國民銀行的董事長亞爾屈里區就是很有希望的一個。</p>
<p>Like Alcuri, the chairman of Chase National Bank, is a very promising one.</p>
<p>在國曾中，杜威政權也極需要相當的人才。</p>
<p>In Congress, the Dewey regime also desperately needs considerable talent.</p>
<p>這是用以保持國會與白宮關係的。</p>
<p>This is to maintain the relationship between Congress and the White House.</p>
<p>華倫，他正和杜威一樣，是新到華盛頓的人物，所以不甚適當。</p>
<p>Warren, like Dewey, is a newcomer to Washington, so he is not very suitable.</p>

<p>According to past experience, the adjustment of loading and unloading fees is often a harbinger of ticket price adjustments. The interval between the two is at most half a month, and at least five days.

<p>海宙輪載米來滬　折駛高雄港避風　　〔本報訊〕</p>

<p>輪船裝卸工底薪仲裁加百分七五　　〔本報訊〕</p>
<p>Arbitration increases the basic salary of stevedores by 75 percent [Report from this newspaper]</p>
<p>輪船艙口裝卸工人，此次要求提高底薪。</p>
<p>This time, the stevedores requested an increase in their basic salary.</p>
<p>該項工人之底薪原爲二角四分一噸，照指數計算。</p>
<p>The basic salary of these workers was originally two jiao and four fen per ton, calculated according to the index.</p>
<p>各公司認爲旣以指數計算，况指數又逐漸增高，底薪即不能再增加。</p>
<p>The companies believe that since it is calculated based on the index, and the index is gradually increasing, the basic salary cannot be increased again.</p>
<p>後輪公會與裝缷工會商討，亦無結果，雙方遂申請社會局仲裁。</p>
<p>Later, the Shipping Guild and the Stevedores Union discussed it, but there was no result. Both parties then applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for arbitration.</p>
<p>昨社會局召集雙方代表會議，經仲裁結果，由二角四分基數，增加百分之七十五，計四角二分，按照指數結算，此項爭執乃吿解決。</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of representatives from both parties. After arbitration, it was decided to increase the base of two jiao and four fen by 75%, which is four jiao and two fen, and settle according to the index. This dispute was resolved.</p>
<p>直接稅局員工並未發生餓工　　〔本報訊〕</p>
<p>No hunger strike occurred among employees of the Direct Taxation Bureau [Report from this newspaper]</p>

<p>Previously, all employees of the Direct Taxation Bureau had requested the authorities to increase their salaries to be equal to those of the Customs, and requested the Bureau to temporarily issue three dan of rice before receiving central approval, and then borrow salaries 500,000 times the basic salary per person to maintain their livelihood. The Bureau agreed to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for approval. It was rumored that all employees expressed dissatisfaction with this and had a hunger strike. Yesterday, according to Ge Yanshao, an assistant at the Bureau, this did not happen, and he said that all work in the Bureau was proceeding as usual.</p>

<p>全市銀樓恢復飾金買賣　昨起開始掛牌　條塊仍然禁售　　〔本報訊〕</p>
<p>Gold shops throughout the city resume the trading of gold ornaments Starting yesterday, prices are posted, but gold bars are still prohibited from being sold [Report from this newspaper]</p>
<p>全市大小同行銀樓業百餘家，於昨日起開始飾金掛牌，恢復買賣。</p>
<p>More than 100 gold shops of all sizes in the city started posting prices for gold ornaments yesterday and resumed trading.</p>
<p>每兩兌出價爲三億六千萬元，收進價爲三億二千萬元。</p>
<p>The price for selling out is 360 million yuan per tael, and the price for buying in is 320 million yuan per tael.</p>
<p>按恢復買賣飾金問題，前經市參議會提出，市政會議通過，准先行復業，再由市府向財部備案。</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of resuming the trading of gold ornaments, it was previously proposed by the Municipal Council, passed by the Municipal Council meeting, and approved for resumption of business first, and then the Municipal Government will file it with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>金價計算辦法，係由市政會議決定，依照中央銀行掛牌金價，及美鈔結匯證明書，另加營業費用百分之四十，合法利潤百分之二十，至手工費則視飾物精細程度而定，但最多不得超過金價百分之一百。</p>
<p>The method of calculating the gold price is determined by the Municipal Council meeting, according to the listed gold price of the Central Bank and the exchange settlement certificate of US dollars, plus 40% of operating expenses and 20% of legal profit. The labor cost depends on the fineness of the ornaments, but it must not exceed 100% of the gold price.</p>
<p>該業同業公會，昨日依據上項方式計算後，送請社會局審核，今後牌價上落，由該業公會依據國行結匯證明書牌價自動調整。</p>
<p>After calculating according to the above method yesterday, the industry association submitted it to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. In the future, the price fluctuations will be automatically adjusted by the industry association based on the exchange settlement certificate price of the National Bank.</p>
<p>昨據社局吳局長談稱：銀樓今後祗准飾金買賣，至條塊仍在禁售之列。</p>
<p>According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, gold shops are only allowed to trade gold ornaments in the future, and gold bars are still prohibited from being sold.</p>
<p>又悉各銀樓業奉公會通知後，營業態度均甚謹愼，量入爲出。</p>
<p>It is also learned that after receiving the notification from the association, the gold shops are all very cautious in their business practices and live within their means.</p>
<p>至舊金兌換首飾金，所收貼水爲每兩一百二十萬元，較以前之貼水額提高一倍。</p>
<p>The premium charged for exchanging old gold for jewelry gold is 1.2 million yuan per tael, which is double the previous premium amount.</p>

<p>Free Talk "Treating the Headache by Treating the Foot" by Wu Yong</p>
<p>The authorities are constantly trying to address the economic crisis with both short-term and long-term solutions, but ultimately resort to issuing large denomination banknotes. Certain commentators then deliberately engage in deceptive rhetoric, asking how much ten yuan of pre-war legal tender was worth, and how much one hundred thousand yuan of today's legal tender is worth. To cope with reality, banknotes with a face value of five million yuan are still not flexible enough to fulfill the task of currency. Banknotes with even greater face value than the twenty-five hundred thousand yuan Customs Gold Unit are urgently needed. They further emphasize that the issuance of large denomination banknotes should not affect prices, and the fact that it inevitably affects prices is due to psychological misperceptions among the general public.</p>
<p>Little do they know that whether or not large denomination banknotes stimulate prices is not a matter of "should" or "should not," but purely a matter of fact. Based on past facts, has there ever been a time when the issuance of large denomination banknotes did not cause prices to soar? As for "psychological misperceptions," even if it is a "misperception," if the majority of society holds this "psychological misperception," we must pay attention to it and consider it carefully. For example, low morale is merely a psychological effect. Can military leaders afford to ignore it? The advocates of issuing banknotes with a face value greater than twenty-five hundred thousand Customs Gold Units are probably free from "psychological misperceptions," but listening to their words, they sound like hoarders.</p>
<p>Those who say such things are only a small minority in society, the so-called wealthy "big shots." For any measure that would stimulate price increases, such as abolishing price controls and issuing large denomination banknotes, these people invariably distort it in advance and use every means to bring it about. Once their goal is achieved and prices rise, we can vaguely hear their joyful and encouraging voices behind the scenes, like pigs eating distiller's grains, drunkenly full and lying down, making grunting noises. When they wake up happy, they put on a show, expressing grand theories and justifying price increases in every way, like watching a fire from across the river, observing the mundane world from a carefree cloud. As soon as prices stabilize slightly, they are the first to get anxious, saying that the price of rice is too low compared to other commodities, and if this continues, it will "harm the farmers with cheap prices," and the world will collapse. In reality, these people only have their own personal interests in mind, but when they speak, they insist on discussing the "should" and "should not" of right and wrong. Lu Xun said, "Beware of those who constantly talk about benevolence, righteousness, and morality." Remarque also said, "Cynics often have noble personalities, while idealists tend to be unreliable." Both are probably referring to this type of person.</p>
<p>Now that the large denomination banknotes have been issued, only a few wealthy "big shots" can cover their mouths and laugh upon hearing the news. But what's done is done, and it is useless to say more. However, one cannot help but hope that the authorities will never again go against the tide, not start by stabilizing prices, but instead issue large denomination banknotes to cater to price increases. In particular, it is not appropriate to issue more empty rhetoric about "addressing both the root and the branch." It must be understood that if everything requires "addressing both the root and the branch," it is probably a terminal illness. People today often criticize the government with the saying "treating the headache by treating the head, treating the foot by treating the foot," and the government often takes this as a warning. In fact, a headache should naturally be treated by treating the head, and a foot pain should naturally be treated by treating the foot. What is to be feared is "treating the headache by treating the foot" and "treating the foot by treating the head."</p>
<p>Jiguge by Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Jiguge was located at Qixing Bridge, more than ten li outside Yingchun Gate in Changshu. It was the place where Mao Zijin collected and printed books during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Ye Dehui has already detailed the origins of its book collection and printing in his book "Shulin Qinghua." I have also compiled a chronicle of the Mao family and sons, which is published in the National Central Library Journal. Now, I will describe some trivial matters.</p>
<p>Jiguge used to house the manuscript copy of "Tiewang Shanhu" in fourteen volumes by Zhu Xingfu. Zijin once widely solicited poems for it. His son, Fuji, later pawned it to someone in exchange for ginseng to treat his illness. In the early years of the Republic of China, it suddenly appeared at the antique shop of Xiao Ruqing on Temple Front Street in the town. Ruqing lacked the ability to appraise it, and it was bought by Gui Zhian, a local resident, for ten silver dollars. Zhian then named himself the "Treasure Coral Pavilion Master" and wrote a poem to express his joy. He also reprinted one or two pages with moldy inscriptions by famous people. Each page of this book had the "Jiguge" collection seal. Zhian imitated this and also stamped a collection seal on each page, which detracted from its value. Later, it was pawned to the Shen Fanggu family in the town. Fanggu's son repeatedly invited me to view it, but I delayed and failed to do so. I heard that it has now changed hands again.</p>
<p>Many descendants of the Jiguge family practice medicine near Qixing Bridge and are no longer known for collecting books. Years ago, my friend Cao Jiusheng visited Yin Lake to search for books and learned that most of the Mao family's books were sold by weight. Some of their descendants were addicted to gambling and divination. Therefore, he only obtained the old manuscript copy of "Mr. Zijin's Deeds" and the Ming edition of "Jiang Jiang Ji" to take back. However, "Deeds" contains many anecdotes about Jiguge, and I used it extensively for my chronicle. "Jiang Jiang Ji" is also not recorded in the catalogs of other libraries. The Siku Quanshu lists it in its list of works that only survive with title, indicating that it is also a rare book in the country.</p>
<p>There are many people in Changshu City who claim to be descendants of "Jiguge." This is like the Wang family always claiming to be from the "Three Scholar Trees," the Tao family always claiming to be from the "Five Willows," and the Zhang family always claiming to be from the "Hundred Tolerances." Their genealogy may not be complete. However, it shows that Zijin's book collection is admired by many.</p>
<p>The "Maobian paper" and "Mao Tai paper" of today were created by the Mao family. "Maobian" is the paper specially made by Mao's printing house, and "Mao Tai" is the Tai character size paper specially made by Mao's printing house.</p>
<p>In recent times, Tao Lanquan has collected the most books printed by Jiguge. He has spent more than thirty years of effort and has collected more than 540 types, but he is still not complete. I once saw "Jianghu Sanren Ji" at Shen Shirun's Xirenzhai. Few collectors know its name, and it is one of the rare books in the country.</p>
<p>Although Jiguge printed many books, only one or two types in the history section and several types in the collection section are excellent. However, he sold the fields attached to the city to engage in engraving, which people considered a good thing. I say it takes a hundred times more courage. Do wealthy people today have this style? The publishing industry is on the verge of extinction. Even if it is called foolishness, its foolishness is truly unattainable.</p>
<p>The Honeymoon is Not Sweet by Liu An</p>
<p>Two famous sociologists in New York recently asked one hundred young married women for their true opinions about their honeymoon trips. The result was that fifty-two young women definitely stated that they did not feel any pleasure on their honeymoon. Two said that their honeymoon was simply "terrible." Only seventeen said that they had a very pleasant honeymoon.</p>
<p>The Mississippi State Social Health Association also conducted a similar test, and the result was that more than 60% of the brides felt more pain than pleasure on their honeymoon trips.</p>
<p>The main reasons are: (1) They are extremely tired from preparing for the wedding. They originally hoped to rest during the honeymoon, but they did not expect the trip to be very tiring, so their spirits were low and their tempers were bad. (2) Too much money is spent, so the new couple is worried. Sometimes they argue in order to save money.</p>
<p>Do You Have Insomnia? by Yanbo</p>
<p>When Napoleon was at the height of his military success, he slept at most four or five hours within every twenty-four-hour period. During this period, he showed amazing performance in both physical and intellectual strength. When he inspected the front lines on horseback, he often stayed on horseback for ten hours in a row. When he returned to camp, he immediately held meetings with his staff until late at night. After the meeting was over, he called in his secretary, gave him instructions, wrote many letters, carefully reviewed them, revised them, reviewed them again, and then signed them. He was like a heavenly dog, never feeling tired.</p>
<p>However, later, the Battle of Waterloo shattered his dream of conquering the world, and he was exiled to the lonely island of Saint Helena. At that time, his lifestyle suddenly underwent a tremendous change. He used to need only four or five hours of sleep, but now he was almost lazy all day with nothing to do, but he had to sleep eight or nine hours a night.</p>
<p>Is it true that the busier you are, the less sleep you need?</p>
<p>Modern psychologists are actually saying: That's right.</p>
<p>When they treat patients with insomnia, they no longer focus on teaching them how to "fall asleep," but on teaching those patients to work well when they are awake. Doctors say that as long as people can develop interest in their work, and this work can also increase their prestige and status—making them feel different from others—then no matter how long the working hours are and how short the sleeping hours are, it doesn't matter at all and will not affect their health.</p>
<p>It is said that there was a gambler who could stay awake for several days and nights when he was winning money, and his spirits were still very good. If his luck suddenly changed and he turned defeat into victory, he had to go to bed for more than ten hours. Gambling is certainly not "work," but the relationship between a person's mood and sleep can be seen.</p>
<p>Someone once visited the great inventor Edison, and Edison expressed the following grand theory:</p>
<p>He said: Sleeping is really just a senseless bad habit. Although we can't get rid of it for a while, we will eventually get rid of it slowly. Most people sleep as much as eight or nine hours a day, and as a result, they often feel tired. In fact, humans don't need to sleep at all. In the future, everyone will sleep much shorter than they do now—just as we sleep much less now than our ancestors did. People used to work at sunrise and rest at sunset, so of course they slept longer than we do. I believe that in a million years, everyone will not need beds at all.</p>
<p>Edison's words may be a bit too much, but he himself certainly practiced what he preached, reducing the "bad habit" of sleeping to the lowest limit.</p>
<p>Among the famous figures in history, such as Frederick the Great, who had great military achievements, such as the great German poet Schiller, such as the famous physicist Humboldt, such as the British surgical authority Hunter, such as the great German pathologist Virchow, they were all extremely busy with affairs, and everyone only slept four or five hours a day.</p>
<p>The so-called "eighteen hours of sleep" is a quote from the ancient British King Alfred the Great. Because people think Alfred was a smart and talented good emperor, they feel that what he said will never be wrong. But they don't know that this sentence was quoted incorrectly. He said, "One-third of the day is used for eating, sleeping, and exercise." The meaning is that the time spent on these three things should add up to one-third of the day. This is not a distortion of what he said. Alfred himself never slept more than six hours a night.</p>
<p>What's the big deal about insomnia? Maybe there is no such thing as "insomnia" in the world!</p>
<p>Rice and Salt by Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>I don't know how much grain is enough to feed the population. Today, food is calculated by weight, and there are scientific methods. How can a non-expert comment rashly? Mencius, in the Royal System, said that a lord's salary could feed four senior officials, a senior official could feed seventy-two people, and a lord could feed two hundred and eighty-eight people. Zhang Taiyan said, "In ancient times, one sheng was equivalent to two he in modern times. According to the Rites of Zhou, in a good year, a person ate two shi, five dou, and six sheng, which is equivalent to thirty shi, seven dou, and two sheng. This is equivalent to six shi, one dou, four sheng, and four shao today. Because it also included hemp and beans, this number was obtained." Did ancient people eat so much? Until the eleventh year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, the salt trade was fixed at four hundred jin per yin. Lin Zexu said, "Each person eats three qian of salt per day, and each yin of four hundred jin of salt is enough to feed sixty people for a whole year." The estimate of three qian is probably not wrong. Recently, I saw a food bill for a government agency. The settlement for November and December of the 37th year of the Republic of China showed that about fifty people ate. Each person ate seven he and six shao of rice, seven qian of soybean oil, eight qian and two fen of soy sauce, and four qian and four fen of salt per day. This agency was in Shanghai. At that time, the price of rice in Shanghai was about 2.5 million yuan per shi. With such high prices, there was no reason to waste, so it is credible. The measurement uses the modern market system.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes from a Mouse Peeking into the Pavilion by Yushou by Yushou</p>
<h3 id="e42">Wu Qingyuan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo stated that Wu Qingyuan is currently competing with the Japanese chess master Honinbo Shusai and has already won one game. This report is not detailed enough and also contains historical inaccuracies. For example, it says that Qingyuan was taken to Japan by Shusai from Beijing twenty years ago and extravagantly claims that Qingyuan's entry into the chess academy was entirely due to Shusai's efforts, but it does not know that this is contrary to the facts.</p>
<p>Qingyuan is the son of Wu Yulong, a Fujianese. Yulong was a former official in Beijing and was also able to play chess, but not skillfully. Qingyuan was outstanding in chess at the age of nine and became famous at the age of thirteen. Yulong died soon after in poverty, and the family became even more difficult. His mother ordered him to treat Gu Shuiru as a foster father, and he followed Shuiru to the door of Duan Hefei, receiving a monthly stipend of one hundred yuan. When Hefei was defeated, Qingyuan was very confused. The Japanese seventh-dan master Inukai Seki, with the chess academy's authorization, summoned him to Japan, promising that his mother and brother could go with him. All expenses were borne by the Japanese financial magnate Okura, which had nothing to do with Honinbo Shusai. Moreover, when Qingyuan first entered the chess academy, Inukai strongly advocated giving him the third dan, but Shusai still thought it was presumptuous and only allowed the first dan. There was a fierce debate during the discussion. Then, Shusai personally tested him in three games, giving him two stones in two games and three stones in one game. Qingyuan used a free and concise new strategy to defeat Shusai three times, and the title was determined. Shusai came from a fishmonger's background, was crude and uneducated, and was also narrow-minded. Because Qingyuan joined Inukai's faction as a disciple as soon as he arrived in Japan instead of following him, he deeply resented him and tried every means to thwart him. The Central News Agency reporter said that Qingyuan's achievements in Japan were all due to Shusai's recognition and selection, which is a serious misunderstanding of history.</p>
<p>In 1934, Qingyuan officially competed with Shusai in Tokyo. Although he lost by two points, his strategy was novel, his moves were quick, and his composure was calm. It seemed that he had a high degree of cultivation. Japanese public opinion even praised him as a master who would define an era. In fact, Qingyuan lost his education in his early years and knew nothing but Go. However, he was honest and sincere, and he did not like to be proud. Therefore, he could still give people a pure and cautious feeling.</p>
<p>For ten years, Qingyuan has been known in Japan as an invincible black stone holder. No one has the confidence to give him the first move. Shusai is gradually getting old and tired, and he is no exception. The Central News Agency reporter said that Wu had just won one game, which is very credible.</p>
<p>Laiyang Pear by Zhuying</p>
<p>Laiyang pear is a special product of Laiyang County, Shandong Province, and is known as a fine product along with Feicheng peach and Leling jujube. Large pears weigh one jin and five or six liang, while small pears can weigh three or two pieces per jin. The fruit is oblong and round, and the skin is green and rough. Those that are delicate, light in color, strong in flavor, and fragrant are not genuine products. Those with small golden spots on the skin are the most sweet and delicious, with no residue and no fragrance. Pears are harvested after the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Pear trees bloom in late spring, with white flowers that have five petals and very long stems, like white crabapple. When they bloom, the trees are covered in silver, and the fragrance of the flowers is intoxicating. When the east wind rises, swarms of wasps surround the trees, staying there all night, which is not without damage to the pears. Pear trees are also prone to insects. Pear farmers hire workers to catch bees and insects under the trees all day long, which is very laborious.</p>
<p>The trees are not very tall, with a girth of about one arm span, and the trunk is no more than three or four feet long, forming a round canopy like a car cover. After the flowers fall, the fruit gradually grows larger and larger. The fruit is plentiful, and the branches droop to the ground, making it easy to pick.</p>
<p>Trees can bear fruit five or six years after grafting, but gradually bear less after seventeen or eighteen years. They bear the most fruit around ten years.</p>
<p>Laiyang farmers mostly grow pears for a living, in order to make large profits. Pear trees form forests in the four townships of Laiyi. The sandy soil of the Wulong River oxbow lake area, twenty li southeast of the city, produces the best pears, which are the true Laiyang pears. However, the area is only a few dozen mu.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Thorough Implementation of Direct Goods and Two-Tax Agency Merger <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] This reporter, to understand the circumstances of the merger of direct goods and two-tax agencies, specifically visited the financial authorities. It is said that the issue of merging direct goods and two-tax agencies has been noted by people in society during the Anti-Japanese War, and the successive People's Political Councils have also considered this a matter of urgent importance. However, due to various difficulties at that time, it has not been realized until now. Now, at the beginning of constitutional governance, national expenditures are vast. In order to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and rectify tax administration, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for a decision to thoroughly merge the direct goods and two-tax agencies of this ministry from top to bottom. In addition to changing the two administrations to the National Taxation Administration, each province will be changed to the National Taxation Bureau, and the important counties and cities will be divided into the National Taxation Collection Bureau. A total of sixteen original two-tax district bureaus and eighty branch bureaus have been abolished. In the future, the management of the two taxes will be unified and the business will be centralized. In terms of tax collection, the effect of mutual assistance can be achieved, and it will also be convenient for merchants to pay taxes. As for the tax officials who originally served in the direct goods and two taxes, most of them have passed the examination and training or have been qualified through selection. In the past, they have made contributions and should be allowed to retain their original positions and continue to serve. Although there will be reductions according to the new system, there are also reasonable and fair standards set.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Northeast People's Comfort Group hosted reporters on the 26th, and in a written statement demanded that the government: (1) Severely punish Xu Huidong, the culprit. (2) Severely punish Chen Jicheng, the Commander of the Garrison responsible for security, and the gunmen, specifying that the shooters were soldiers of the 208th Division. (3) Quickly resolve the education and living problems of Northeast students stranded in Beiping. (4) The current measures for restricting the circulation currency still need to be improved.

<h3 id="e52">Cutting off Railway Transport Between East and West Germany; Britain and the United States Implement a Counter-Blockade; The Three Powers in London Discuss Strategies Against the Soviet Union <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper]: A broadcast from London on the 26th stated that the ability of both Britain and the United States to cope with the Berlin situation has become stronger today. The occupation military governments of both sides, on the pretext of "technical difficulties," suddenly ordered the blockade of all railway transport between the Western Zone and the Soviet occupation zone, but mail and telegrams remained unobstructed. The so-called "technical difficulties" are actually a retaliatory action against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. When the Soviet Union ordered the cut-off of all land and water transportation between the western zone of Berlin and the outside world, it also used "technical difficulties" as an excuse. It is also learned that after the British and American military governments in Frankfurt ordered the blockade of all railway transportation between the Western Zone and East Germany today, more than 70,000 tons of supplies will not be able to start shipping. Most of these supplies come from Italy and were originally scheduled to be delivered to the East German occupation zone in early August.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] Senior British, American, and French representatives held talks for more than an hour in the office of the British Deputy Foreign Secretary Strang today to discuss new ways of negotiating with Moscow. Since the Foreign Ministers' meeting broke up unhappily last December, this three-power meeting is probably the most important. The London meeting came after a gathering of US military and diplomatic representatives in Berlin on the 25th. The series of meetings is understood to be related to the West's new policy on the Berlin crisis and the entire Soviet relationship. After the meeting, French Ambassador Massigli was the first to walk out of the venue, rush into the car, and rush to an appointment. Five minutes later, the American delegation appeared at the door, smiling for photographs, but refusing to speak. The members of the delegation included US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, and State Department expert on Soviet issues Bohlen. In addition to Strong, the British representatives also included Dean, the Director of the Political Department of the Foreign Office's German Division. Although each representative refused to speak, this meeting clearly discussed new strategies for dealing with the Soviet Union, hoping to resolve the Berlin crisis and the entire German situation. A Foreign Office spokesman said that the final version of the new note to the Soviet Union has not yet been approved. "Several drafts will be sent to the three powers for study." British and American representatives met again on the afternoon of the 26th, and Foreign Secretary Bevin and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson, who had asked for leave to return home, also attended. British Commander-in-Chief in Germany Robertson will fly back to London on the 27th to report on recent developments to Bevin before the House of Commons debate on diplomacy on the 28th.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] According to today's announcement, members of Congress who are about to reconvene have been notified, stating that the Soviet Union's actions in Berlin are purely bluster, so there is no need to fear the United States being under the shadow of war. They have also been privately informed that intelligence reports from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany indicate that the Soviet side is not prepared for military action to drive Western countries out. Britain, America, and France firmly refuse to withdraw from Berlin, and the Soviet Union will eventually yield. The congressmen who listened know that the three headquarters in the Soviet zone must know this.</p>
<p>Senior officials here said that the three powers may draft a new note this weekend to protest to Moscow again. According to official hints, the new note will denounce the Soviet Union's attempt to suppress its former allies from withdrawing from Berlin, which is a clear violation of the United Nations Charter. However, it is believed that if the Soviet Union is willing to lift the siege of Berlin and recognize the Allies' right to continue to station troops in Berlin, the West is willing to invite the Soviet Union to attend a four-power meeting to discuss the entire German issue. All congressmen who spoke with Clay agreed that, barring accidents, current US policy will ease the crisis.</p>

<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 26th] South's commander-in-chief, Kartelj, reported to the South Communist Congress on the 26th that "The Communist Party is fighting for the new Yugoslavia." In its foreign policy section, it stated that South's will continue to be anti-imperialist and pro-Soviet, and will not change due to the Communist Information Bureau's offensive. Kartelj listed the five major principles of South's foreign policy:</p>
<p>(1) Based on equality and the ideals of the United Nations, universally strive for peace and cooperation. (2) Cooperate economically with every country based on equality and mutual international obligations. (3) Support all forces and people's democratic countries that strive for peace and national liberation. (4) Support the Soviet Union's and people's democratic countries' anti-imperialist policies. (5) Develop cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries in all matters and objects in terms of economic culture. Kartelj also fiercely criticized American imperialism, saying that "The people the American empire relies on in Germany are also the German capital monopolists on whom Hitler relied when he decided to conquer the world, but from imperialist plans to their realization, the journey is really very long." Observers believe that Kartelj's speech indicates that Yugoslavia's foreign policy remains unchanged, and judging from the third principle, South's will still aid General Markos' guerrillas in Greece.</p>
