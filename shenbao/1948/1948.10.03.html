<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕全國敵偽產業變價出售所得，爲金圓券發行準備金之一部份，其數目相當龐大。據各地淸理機關業已淸理及確定產權立刻可以出售之敵偽產業，總値達三億三千二百七十四萬金圓，折合美金爲八千三百十八萬五千元，而且尚有東北區已估價待售之敵偽產業五千餘萬金圓，及陸續卽可處理結案出售之大量敵偽物資，均未列入。因此全國敵偽產業之出售所得總値，將渝美金一億元以上。據現時估價之敵偽產業三億三千餘萬金圓數額中，以地產一項所占數目最大，約爲全額之百分之七十。若按地區分別計算則蘇浙皖區所占數目最多，達一億五千餘萬金圓。河北平津區佔八千七百餘萬金圓。山東宵島區佔四千餘萬金圓，武漢區佔四千餘萬金圓，粵桂閩區佔一千一百餘萬金圓。河南區佔二百五十餘萬金圓。</p>
<p>〔又電〕行政院處理敵偽產業檢討會議，二日繼續開會，由主委何浩若主持，出席中央各有關部會代表及全國各地區處理敵偽產業機構負責人，上午會議討論提案，經通過第一審查小組報告，內提案三件，爲（甲）關於谷地方政府機關接收動用之敵偽物資，多有無從追查或收款無着，擬具結案辦法案，其辦法爲。（一）各地方機關接收動用之敵偽物資，如經各省府證明當時確屬因公動用而其數量不多，價値又不鉅者，准由處理機關斟酌情形，予以銷案。（二）各地方機關因公動用之接收敵偽物資，如數量價値較鉅者，由處理機關彙案呈院、於補助地方經費項下扣抵，或准追加預算轉賬結案，（三）各方機關接受之敵偽物資雖經接受，但未動用者，仍應交由處理。（四）各地方機關接收之敵僑物資，屢經追查或因隔時太久，或因主管更易，或因改組撒銷，或因並無原始淸冊或接收　證可資核對而始終查無着落，一併列單呈院核銷。</p>
<p>（乙）關於各機關及軍事機關依法接收敵偽產業之如何作價　賬及催收結案，擬具辦法：（一）撥交國營事業機關經營之工廠及其設備，應由各該區處理機構列冊呈院核定，其作價標準限本年年底以前轉賬以資結案，其有歷年經營所得盈餘，亦應爲案，交由處理機構轉解國庫，（二）各政府機關軍事機關接收之敵偽產業，未移交處理及未作價淸算者，應分別嚴予核定，何者必須留用，何者不必留用，其必須留用者，郎應限期照價轉賬，其不必留用者，卽限令移交處理。</p>
<p>（丙）爲各機關接收留用敵偽產業，擬請額化辦理轉賬手續案。</p>
<p>嗣討論第二組審查報告，對平津靑島等地之敵偽產業處理，以何浩若之意見爲結論，作爲對該區敵偽產業處理之原則。何氏稱：「平津青島等地情形固屬特殊，然較之東北又無髯謂爲樂土勝地，東北入關游資其先必經平津而求出路，如能善爲利導，未必不可納入正軌，如將一般極合改用之敵產房屋，公平定價，且使買主能有管業保證，彼等對認購敵偽產業必樂爲之，如各地機構感於本身權力有限，另組織各地處理敵偽產業督導委會，由當地高級軍政長官組成，負責督導執行標賣出淸等事，處理機關應拿出勇氣，負責並放膽去做。」最後討論第三審查小組所提出之「加速出售敵偽房地產辦法草案」，亦經修正通過</p>
<p>〔又電〕行政院處理敵偽產業委員會主委何浩若，爲加强各地區敵偽產業之處理工作及督導各該區敵偽產業迅速變價出售，定本月十五日前後分別出發赴全國各地視察督導。何氏之行程將先至靑島，然後轉赴平津以至東北，下月初旬始行返京，再度視察京滬，轉武漢，華南等地。據何氏表示，將以大無畏之精神，處理是項敵偽產業，各地花園洋棋之敵偽產業，必須最先出售，並將以最大決心，在六個月內將是項工作辦竣。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　國民黨和中斬現狀</h3>
<p>— 毛子水</p>
<p>從國民政府奠都南京以來，已滿二十年了。這二十餘年中，除却最後的一年，中國的中央政府，名義上都是由國民黨主持。而內亂外患，層見疊出：民生日以凋敝，國勢日以阽危。因此，大多數的談論國事的人，都駡國民黨：卽國民黨中較開明的份子，亦以爲責無旁貸，咎由自取。</p>
<p>我以爲要判定國民黨對於中國現狀的責任，應先明白這種現狀的來源。現在我們這個國家所以糟到如此地步，最近最大而最明顯的原因，當然就是內戰，有了內戰，而交通破壞，而土地荒蕪，而物價騰貴，而多數的老百姓都有無衣無食的恐慌。</p>
<p>國民黨的政府無論是好是壤，我從來沒有想到把內戰的責任加到國民黨身上。第一，中國的內戰，是由於共產黨用武力來爭政權而起的。國民政府，是世界各國——包括蘇維埃聯邦共和國在內——所承認爲中國的正式政府的。任何人用武力來叛亂，這個政府都可以——而且應當——用武力去禁止他。第二，共產黨的目的，是統治世界。無論中央政府如何讓步，如何容忍，中國的共產黨，如果够得上共產黨的資格，决不肯放棄武力以誠心誠意來謀國內的和平的。中央政府中的許多弱點，固然是共產黨號召革命的話柄；其實，政府無論如何賢明，如果不是共產黨的政府，或雖是共產黨的政府而不屬於列寗史達林的嫡系的，都是現在共黨情報局的黨徒所指爲反動而要推倒的。這種情形，我想中國共產黨內的誠實人决不會否認的。既然如此，我們若把內戰的責任加在國民政府身上，豈不太寃枉了安分的人呢？</p>
<p>有些人以爲內戰延長，民不聊生，中央政府不能速定禍亂，便失去了政府的資格，這都是國民黨的無能所致。我以爲中國共黨的滋長，大原因有二。一是日本的侵略中國，使中央政府不暇顧及共黨；二是雅爾達會議中，羅斯福先生認不淸人，硬要蘇俄速向日本開戰，因有那種損人不利己的密約。到了日本投降後，蘇俄遂把從關東軍手中接受來的兵器，給了中國的共軍，這樣實力雄厚的流寇，當然不是短時期中所能平定的。我們如果以政府的不能速平禍亂爲國民黨的無能，國民黨似亦可以提出下面的自贊以抵抗我們的毀謗：</p>
<p>「要是沒有國民政府的努力，在美國人打敗日本以前，中國必早已爲日本所吞滅了：要是國民黨不大買氣力，負起國家與亡的責任來，中國或許就在共黨情報局統制之下了！」</p>
<p>一個平心靜氣的人，如果不是共產黨的信徒，對於國民黨這種的自負，是不能完全否認的。</p>
<p>說到這裏，容許會有人疑心我故意替國民黨辯護。我可以明白的告訴大家，我寫這篇文字的動機，是要來替國民黨辯護的。我知道這件事情，似乎是要犯衆怒的。衆怒固然可怕；但我牛平最佩服明朝呂新吾先生一句話：「爲人辯寃白謗，是第一天理。」我寗可犯衆怒，不可違天理。如果我知道世人有寃枉共產黨的地方，我亦一樣的不怕衆怒來替共產黨辯護。（爲便利讀者起見，我護聲明一下；我不是共產黨，也不是國民黨。）</p>
<p>一個人批評科學家或藝術家，有時很能原諒他們的缺點：等到他批評政治家，便吹毛求疵，亳不放鬆。這實在是一件很不公平的事情。我以爲幹政治的，世界上最難的事情。一個科學家，整天在實騐室裏工作，無論如何勞苦，總有自得其樂的地方。一個幹政治的人，爲人類的進步，爲人類的幸福，往往心力交瘁，有時還要受到意料以外齣橫逆。不是有大仁大勇的人，决不肯做這種事情的。（我這裏所說的政治家，當然指具有「民胞物與」的心胸而以「淑世淑人」爲事業的人而言。若偷竊權柄欺罔民衆以遂一己私慾的人，那便和盜賊一樣。過去中國的軍閥，大部分都是這樣人：那是萬萬不能算作政治家的，）所以我們對於幹政治的人，多多少少應有點格外的敬崇。當然，對於政治家的錯誤，我們也應該毫不客氣的糾正他。你須時常體念到你家中僕人的勞苦，但你亦可以指謫他的過失。設使他偶然無心的做錯了一件事情，你便大大的責罰他，這恐怕不是一個君子人對待僕人的道理的。我希望談政治的君子，對於眞正幹政治的人，至少須具有對待僕人的態度。我向所以不輕易駡幹政治的人，原因就在這裏。</p>
<p>國民黨所以爲世人所睡駡，最大齣罪名，就是：柄政二十多年，天天喊三民主義，一直到現在，一民也沒有做好，這似乎是應該駡的。但我亦不敢隨便駡。試思國民政府奠都南京以後，初則有江西共軍的變亂，有北方馮閻的變亂，不久便有九一八事變，有淞滬的戰爭，有「人民政府」等等的變亂，到了七七事變以後，日本軍閥肆行侵略，而共產黨軍隊遂乘機蔓延到北方各省，這些內憂外息紛至沓來的當中，國民政府不坍壹便算很不錯，我們還能期望他做出什麼事情嗎？一個鄉下的老百姓，一有不順意，便怨天尤人；給人家偷去一隻雞，就開口大駡政治的不淸明。我們要有一點歷史的眼光，則我們對於中國的現狀，雖然不能讚美政府，却亦不能像鄉下人那樣的隨便駡的。</p>
<p>平心而論，這二十年來，國民黨中雖然有一部分心思狹窄的人，標榜以黨治國，究其實，則國民政府行政的首長，沒有幾個是老國民黨員。這些人裏邊的「社會賢達」，固然和黨無關：就是眞正的黨員，大部分都是着眼在國和民上面，而沒有看眼在黨的上面。所以就黨的立塲而言，，國民黨是失敗的：就國家的立塲而言，國民黨雖然沒有做出什麼大成績，至少可以値得「識大體」三字的評語。</p>
<p>近來國內的報紙和雜誌上，常常有討論或批評國民黨的文字，黨員的和非黨員的。有許多話，並且說得很對，但似乎很少歷史的觀點出發的。我現在純粹從政治史的立塲，以討論我們對於國民黨和中國現狀的關係所應取的看法，我希望我們的靑年知識分子或老年的議論家，下自處理家庭的事務，上至批評政洽的得失，都要存責人薄而責己厚的心腸，方不失却泱泱大國之風。我們這個民族，有了兩三千年「文化」的傳統。我們在政治上的風度，須求趕上英國人；至少亦要趕上美國人。像法國人那樣，國家到了危急的時侯，還是你爭我奪，閙個不休；這樣的國民，我們應當引以爲鑒戒！其他更卑更劣的民族，天天以互相「革命」或「淸黨」爲事，我們大可不必模仿！（寄自北京大學史學系）</p>

<h3>原子能談判僵局可打開　蘇聯提出新建議　主張國際間訂柄項公約　取締原子武器與設置管制機構並行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎二日廣播：蘇聯之原子能政策，突有重大之轉變，放棄其原來之主張，在成立國際管制機構以前，先行毀滅並取締一切原子武器之要求，而建護同時取締原干武器及設置國際原子能管制機構。維辛斯墓二日正式建議制定兩種草約，一爲取締原子武器，一爲設置國際管制機構，兩約同時簽訂並施行。根據此項辦法，原子能委會仍將繼續談判。一般觀察蘇聯政策之轉變，對於增進東西兩方之協調，似無多大助力。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎二日電〕蘇聯及其衛星國二日繼續攻擊美國之原子管制計劃。南斯拉夫代表員伯勒在聯合國政治委員會中，指斥西方國家祭起原子寶劍，作爲外交利器。貝氏又稱，美國草擬管制計劃，用心良苦，務使蘇聯不能接受而後已。渠稱，凡稍具理智者必知美計劃在於使美國永保原子彈之獨佔權而不爲所愚。雖南共傾袖已被共產情報局開除，貝氏之立塲竟與蘇聯外交若台符節。渠反駁英外相貝文所稱如舉世陷入原子戰爭之浩刦中，蘇聯應尸其咎一節，而稱如西方拒絕）穌聯之計劃，則應員一切後果之責任。貝伯勒與蘇外次維辛斯基異口同聲，亦暗示蘇聯巳擁有原子彈，渠稱，「除爲國際集體合作外，吾人不願放棄一絲一毫主權，然美國大企業究竟須於何時始能爲全球謀福利，而對集體合作制感到興趣？聯合國多數國家認識欲强令擁有原子彈之國家毀棄其原子彈藏，乃一　危險之事。吾人可以一百對一打賭，該多數必將竭盡全力妨碍蘇聯計劃之通過。此舉形成以壓力施諸一般認爲無原子彈，至少所擁數量不足與美國相埒之蘇聯。」貝伯勒演說將終，籲請西方國家支持蘇聯所提取締原子彈及毀棄美國兵工廠內所貯之原子彈之計劃。渠稱，此舉可使全球免於陷入戰爭之深淵。法國防部長賴瑪迪繼起發言，表示法國完全擁護比代表之建議成立一小組委員會，授以進行談判及努力達成協定之權。渠並對蘇發出警告稱，蘇聯既可能已有原子彈，則國際管制，視察及調查勢所必至。賴氏稱，如美國被要求在國際管制及監視制度成立前，卽毀棄所有原子彈，則此舉不啻將原子獨佔權自美國移交騙士手中。渠係針對維辛斯基及貝伯勒所謂美國獨佔似一種幻想。賴氏言後，蘇外次維辛斯基怒斥賴氏恪遵其美國主子之原子政策，而拒絕其呼籲。維氏所提賴瑪迪之主子計有李連泰爾，杜魯門及社威等。</p>
<h3>軍事援助西歐聯盟　美考慮新租借制　美使用西空軍基地已成立協定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕消息靈通人士一百稱：美政府高級人員刻正自相辯論，應否租借軍　，俾增强西歡軍事聯盟。如主張租借計劃者佔上風，則該計劃將於明春提交國會，然其前應有下列數事：（一）西歐軍事聯盟之組織必先完竣。按聯盟由英法比荷盧五國組成，刻在倫敦集會，蒙哥馬利元帥巳被提名爲統帥。（二）聯盟必須決定所需諸物，本身力能担負之軍器及應向美國申請者。</p>
<p>（三）總統及國家安全會議應決定軍援是否係美國最佳之安全指置。（三）應決定歐洲對美國國防有何可協助之處。傳國務院某委員係祖借案之主要贊成人，而全國軍事組織中擁護者亦不乏其人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎一日電〕此間政治評論家指出西歐聯盟五國所成立之當設軍事團，既非聯合軍事參謀處，亦非獨一統率處，其主要目標乃在調整一切預備計劃，尤其為此五國防務所用戰品之出產與購買，另有二基本目標，乃屬各政府之工作：（一）舊大陸不能將其防務置於美國軍隊完全支配之下，而必須有賴自己努力經營。（二）西歐各國間之合作，不能視爲似足供給五國充分之實力，以保障彼等之安全，遇有經濟政治事件，須請美國予以援助。就經濟而論，美國現正籌募巨款，以供其自己整軍經武，並予歐洲以經濟援助之用，故新租借制度不得損及此二目標之一。就政治而論，新國會審議予歐洲之軍事援助，此將等於使西歐聯盟化爲大西洋聯盟。新國會行將召開，以決定西歐是否應予保衛，或僅予以援助或完全葉之而弗顧。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二日電〕據每日郵報」華盛頓訪員來電稱，根據美參謀總都所起草之西方防衛計劃，西班牙之空軍基地亦將包括在內。現美國巳與西班牙弗朗哥交涉，不久以後該項基地即可由美空軍自由使用。又據每日郵報消息稱，關於此事美西巳有協定　結。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處紐約一日電〕幾天前聯合國大會的蘇聯代表維辛斯基在數灭前在聯大慷慨激昂之演說中，竟誤將一個油公司的圖表，當作美國「第三次大戰太平洋戰區地圖」。「紐約時報」今天的社論對之有如下的押述：「如果這就代表俄國人從天國所獲得的情報，那末，他們雇用齣一批間諜的素質，實述遜於參院湯麥斯委員會所傳者。維氏所指的地圖並非第三次大戰的地圖，而是三四年印行前二次大戰地岡。伊索公司是一個民營的公司，將它印了出來。自然，維辛斯基會問「如果這個不能證明美國正計劃從新幾內亞塔拉瓦進攻蘇聯，什麼才能證明呢？」　　斯基指責美國正在策劃對蘇戰爭，我們的新聞記者與「美國之音」廣播應當一再提醒世界人民一點，就是美國人厭倦任何對蘇或對別國的戰爭。」</p>

<h3>未亡人語　少年得志為聲色所迷　張亞民死於交友不愼</h3>
<p>王蕙蘅無意受遺物　不理張妻廣告啟事</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備司令部前經濟科長張亞民伏法後，遺贈女友「董女士」鋼筆一枝，照片兩張，香　一把，其妻最近在報端刊登「致薏女士」啓事，請往收取，措詞哀怨，頗引人注目，黨女士者，衆皆知係女票友王薰蘅女士，張在生前對之甚爲傾倒，被捕前三日，方擬與其勢離異而與王　嫁娶。入獄之後，猶賦詩寄懷，其詩云：一秋雨連日落，憐代淚泉桔，何日携手再，摘花戲蝶舞。」戀念之情，固油然紙上焉。張死後外界對王女頗有議論。記者昨訪張妻於新閘路張之寓所，見鐵扉緊閉，庭院冷落，會客室中供有張之靈合遺像，光綫幽黯，悽寂無聲，惟室中朱紅之漆柱及續頂紅紅綠綠之小燈泡，猶可想見昔日賣賓雲集，縣影婆娑之豪華盛况。張妻形容攘削，據云薏女士至今未往彼處，故紙得將該項遺物長期保存矣。渠稱與張爲警官學校同學，結　四載，育有一女，張本亦有爲靑年，且頗有才幹，惜來滬以後，因擢升要職，少年得志，交友不慎，遂爲聲色所迷，渠曾一再勸告，然張不納忠言，反目之爲「鄉下人」，遂自種惡果，若張者，可謂犠牲於上海萬惡環境中之一人。至與蕙女士之認識，係在宴會中經人介紹，其後女生日，來東相邀，由此過從日密，且常於週末駕車共遊虹橋。惟王之父對張頗不贊成，張極爲好勝，必欲得王而甘心，乃與其妻簽離婚字據，不料未三日卽被捕矣。張遺言稱：「人生如夢，我的夢太短了。」昨張妻則稱：「我的夢太辛酸凄涼了。渠刊登致黨女士啓事後，僅接得一與雙方有關人物之電話，對其舉動頗不以爲是，並認爲有酸醋作用，渠昨日力表並無此意。其寓邸原爲周邦俊之逆產，現當局卽將收回，渠將另行覓屋他遷，並擬覓一職業以供養張之母妹云。記者昨又訪王　　女土，未獲面見，而由其父王準臣接談，據云其女年　變十，是一「小孩子」，根本還不懂愛情爲何物，因向來對音樂有天賦及愛好，常登臺客串，乃與外界接觸較多，然與張亞民僅爲普通友誼，外傳種種不足重視。對於張妻之廣告啓事，決置之不理云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕張於獄中時，會於草紙上作詩多首，其妻昨悉予出示，茲誌其中　首如下「寂苦愁牢中，獨有思鄉苦，望望白　想，夢迥孤枕哭。」「壯士入牢中，晨起怕日昇，多少傷心事，魂魄時夜驚。」「抑　投江楚大夫，莫須有死宋將軍，忠良徒有報國節，壯士惜無殺奸心。」「欲將愁懷寄瑤箋，可憐靑烏警往還，算來今夕最愁苦，萬般心事爲月圓。」「勛業已不再縈懷，日夜惟盼得牢菜，養家許國七尺軀，歸山伴樵春砍柴。」</p>

<h3>加稅物品　准予加價　外圍各地物價上漲　即挅有效行動抑平</h3>

<h3>地貨行操縱蔬菜　市區內供應失常　批價連筐計重多種超過限價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者近費數日時間，赴本市郊區吳淞，江灣，浦東，眞如，龍華，法華，徐家滙等地農村及市集作一巡視，結果發現近來市區內蔬菜供應之失常，其　結並非由於四鄉蔬菜產量减少，而係在郊區有無數「地貨行」（卽俗稱菜行），介於生產者與消費者之間，尚未能向法令看齊，致使市區內所有蔬菜市塲步伐紊亂，限價無法保持，供應關係亦無法正常。</p>
<p>環繞上海近郊四週種植蔬菜之土地面積，據約略估計至少當在三萬畝以上，其所種蔬菜，包括各類作物，由春徂冬，從不間斷。加之農家珍視地積，多採用密集種植，如絲瓜藤架下再植洋葱，洋山芋田內空隙間植韮菜；以此種培植所得之產量，供應五百萬人口之副食，論理不應再虞匱乏。目前任何人可軀車往郊區察視，距公路較遠之處，蔬菜田一望無際，毛豆，菠菜，洋葱，韮芽，迎風翻舞，肥碩可愛。</p>
<p>掌握調節實權</p>
<p>此種蔬菜由農家鞠入消費者手中，須經兩個階段：卽先由「地貨行」每日向農民搜購，再由菜販向其　批運來市區轉售疏菜攤阪。概括言之，「地貨行」與生產者關係較密，菜販與消費者關係較深，而掌握數量調節，價格高低之實權者仍爲「地貨行」。一地貨行」散處於郊區每一鄉鎮，較大之鎮集均有卅家以上，渠等之組織極爲簡單，蓆棚一座，一桌一秤以外，職員僅三四人。至菜販大都係外省流亡來滬之難民，現全市營此者約一萬人以上，渠等大部份均賴肩挑步行將蔬菜由郊區運來市膩。</p>
<p>倍蓗之價批出</p>
<p>「地貨行」每日以低價向農民搜得蔬菜後，往往以倍蓗之價，再加佣金，批予菜販，渠等非僅不依規定批價出售，且在過秤時强欲連　計重，故各種蔬菜之實際批價，巳與市區內之限價相等或　較高，菜販爲求適當利潤，自不能不將售價加高，俟攤販再以更高價供諸黑市時，彼此掩飾閃避，限價菜固絕跡市上，正常供應關係，達更無從談起。據一般菜販談稱：渠等雖明知在市區內超越限價出售蔬菜爲違法，但責任不應由渠等担負。</p>
<p>主要蔬菜批價</p>
<p>據記者自各地調查所得，郊區主要蔬菜每斤實際批價（卽包括佣金籃重在內），約略如左：</p>
<p>應予加強管制</p>
<p>郊區唯一情形較付之所在，爲浦東區之各「地貨行」，因該處不時有便衣管制人員巡視監督，故批價較爲理想，連筐計重等惡習亦不常見，如毛豆每斤僅批五分半，　毛菜亦祗批售五分，此種蔬菜在市塲上出售時原可不超越限價，惟因水陸交通不便運費奇昂，菜販多改向貫如，江灣等處批　，因之市區各小菜塲中，限價菜蔬遂告經常絕跡。</p>
<p>目前如欲正本淸滬，使蔬菜恢復正常供應，使每一攤販俱能遵守限價，對於郊區近千家之「地貨行」，似應有加强管制，抑低批價之必要。</p>

<p>漢淸先生：，手書早已奉悉，近來因爲事忙，所以到今天才寫回信，敬請先生原諒。自勝利後，三年以來，全國人民，無不希望過着安定的生活，使國家社會走向正常的道路。爲了達到這一目的，我們不僅要克服政治及軍事上的一切困難，同時在經濟方面，也要同樣的努力，以便消滅造成經濟混亂齣投機，囤積，以及一切不正常的經濟行爲，因此，政府於八月十九日毅然實行經濟管制，幣制改革的決策，這是一種救國救民的正確政策，這量一種救國救民的正確政策。</p>
<p>保護正當營業　取締一切暴利</p>
<p>本人奉命來滬，協助俞鴻鈞先生督導幣制改革，經濟管制，責任艱鉅，其成功與失敗，關係整個國家民族存亡，所以爲了達成任務，不得不採取嚴厲而又堅決的態度，故不論何人，凡違反政府法令的，一概依法嚴懲，任何違法行爲，定加取締。我們所取締的不是工商業的正當營利，而是暴利，所反對的是那些發國難財投機家及其行爲。我們一再申明，絕對保護私有財產及正當的工商業，祗有爲人民謀利益的政策，才能取得人民的擁護，以大多數人民的利益爲利益，和保護正當工商業，這是一件事的兩面，彼此分不開的。在以往的四十二天工作中，我們非常感謝上海的人民給我們許多帮助和鼓勵，因此，我們才能得到初步的成功。</p>
<p>外滙有關商品　將作合理調整</p>
<p>我可以告慰於您的，是上海投機市場已被消滅，銀行存款比較幣制改革前增加了好幾十倍，銀行利息已降低到四五分，這不過是正常經濟生活的第一步。我所說的正常經濟生活，就是正常的交易，公開的買賣，使工商業得到合法的利潤，而人民亦不爲物價高漲所苦，可以過着安定的生活。以往四十餘天的工作，只能說是奠定了安定的經濟生活初步基礎，我們並沒有迷信警察的力量可以解決經濟問題，但是誰也不能否認，在目前的情况下，政治力量是解決經濟混亂的主要條件之一，其方法不外：一方面嚴格執行管制，同時，並在計劃如何安定上海的經濟。目前大家所關心齣是工業原料，據確實調查，除若干種原料之外，大部份的原料，至少可以維持三個月，關於原料供應，政府巳決定，由局業公會與政府機關向各地聯合採購，至於自備外匯在國外所購原料，也決定開放。八一九以後，外匯率已經提高，故進口貨的售價亦隨之提高，我們已經考慮到，對於與外匯有關的商品，將作合理的調整，如此，原料當可源源供給，而無匱乏之虞。</p>
<p>上海物價較低　決使各地看齊</p>
<p>現在，上海物價比較其他各地都低，於是各地單帮都湧向上海收購這種現象之所以發生，由於各地管制不嚴，而上海若干貨物已被凍結，不能暢流，對於這一個問題，政府已決定實施全面管制，，並將蘇·浙·皖三省及南京市劉歸上海督導區管轄。今後我們決定使其他各地的物價能與上海看齊，上海爲我國工業中心，出產數量甚大，如果不使其外銷，勢必影響整個生產，所以我們決定作有計劃的推銷，以求貨暢其流。</p>
<p>導游資於生產　納生活入正軌</p>
<p>游資在上海，已經成爲一個嚴重問題，如果不善爲疏導，勢必造成投機和囤積的現象。現時，除出賣剩餘物資，國營事業股票，短期庫券，以及敵偽產業，以吸收游資外，最重要的，是如何導入生產事業。爲了達到這一個目的，首先必求物價安定。在目前，還有兩種不正確的觀念：第一，若干工商界的人士在近幾年來慣於利用投機及高抬物價以致富，而不以獲得合法利潤爲滿足，認爲不從事國積，或物價不漲，就不能生存，這種不正當的觀念，必需消除。希望從事工商業的人士，安分守己，力求經濟的安定，謀取合法利潤。第二，上海的富人，一向過慣了舒適生活，有一天買不到肉，鷄或鷄蛋，或者呢絨，絨綫，便認爲不得了，要知道，我們目前是處在一個堅苦的時期，必須將經濟生活納入正軌，使市塲安定，這樣，我們才可以過着安定的生活，我們決不因爲目前若干商品缺乏而就長縮，甚至放棄既定的管制政策。</p>
<p>忍受一時苦痛　解決種種困難</p>
<p>一個月以來，我們受到多少感脅，迫使我們對限價讓步。肉商要求漲價，前後有八次之多，可是，我們　願買不到肉，決不讓他漲價。此外，尚有若干小型工廠，因缺乏原料而告停工，我們正在般法，在最近期間替他們解決原料問題，使其復工。我們不怕困難，但是有困難，我們總盡力克服，決不因此而動搖既定的決策。類似這樣的情形，最近將來或者還會有，而且是不可避免的爲了達成經濟管制的任務，不能不忍受一時的痛苦，然而一時的痛苦總此較忍受長期的通貨膨脹的痛苦要輕的多。我們希望上海市民能共體時艱，渡過目前難關，維持我們既得的物價安定的基礎，勿爲奸商所破壤，吾則上海將又變成投機者囤積家的天下，那時全上海的市民又將陷於生活的恐怖中。</p>
<p>絕對維持限價　加緊打擊奸商</p>
<p>在十月裏，政府決定配給市民食米，及公用事菜仍照九月份價格供應市民，其他物價亦不予變吏，總之，除若干與外匯及增稅有關商品將予合理調整外，一概維持「八一九」限價，甚至過高者，將予抑低，使得整個工商業能趨於正常化，但是決不允許任何人乘機抬高物價，擾亂市塲。打擊奸商，是我們齣工作對象之一，始終不會放鬆他們的。政府與人民之間互權利義務，人民對政府的義務，在加强政府的力量，政府對人民亦有安，其生活的責任，政府的困難應公告人民，而人民的痛苦亦應訴諸政府。大家應該水認，今夭的處境萬分困難，但是我們應有冷的態度和　氣去克服牠，這樣才可以獲得安定的生活。敬祝康健！蔣經國。</p>
<h3>浙贛路　西段終點　湘省邊緣株州</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿五日訊〕浙贛路西段終點的株州，現在負荷着東南與西南交通的總　，距離粵漢路株州車站北去五公里的田心　，將來就是粵漢，浙贛與正待興修的湘黔鐵路的聯合總站。</p>
<p>湘省蘊藏的礦物，尤其煤鐵，是今後重工業的重要原料而株州更是水睦交通的中心，所以現在有許多經重工業，如農菜化學工廠，××兵工廠，……都正在朝株州遷移，建廠。</p>
<p>新株州的建設計劃，中央已經有一部份業已決定，如田心瑕聯合總站的準備興修，就是整個建設計劃中的一個交通部門。今後株州的遠景是光明而偉大。</p>
<p>現階段的株州仍然被着一件市鎮的外衣，初次踏進湖南的邊緣，——株州，看到湘人愛吃的檳　大盤長著的餐具，更使我回憶薛伯陵將軍在長沙三捷時，道經株州的慘象，現在是恢復了戰前的舊觀。這裏有銀行，運輸商行，和絡繹不絕的火車與帆船。</p>
<p>這次從株州歸來，半夜在萍鄉下車，萍鄉的一夜，是使我永遠忘不了的一段旅程。城裏有家叫「萍踪」的旅館，因爲夜深人靜，遍找不到，祗好在進城的那條又濕又髒的街上找到「交通」住上。這家小客棧，有姻，有賭，有娼，還有無量數的具虫，和蚊子。睡到床上，和「惡劳力」抵抗，眼巴巴望天亮，不料到二時左右，忽然有個不明身份齣壯漢，衝門而入，兇惡的把我抓起來，開口就間：「你是幹啥的？爲什麼住我的房間」……當時我亦莫明其妙的爲什麼有這回事，後來一個老娘來解釋，這房子原來他訂了，叫局住宿，因爲他吃醉了，請我原諒他。</p>
<p>打聽這位兇漢是誰，這才知道他是來自榮軍醫院的「負傷戰士」，眞是「秀才遇到兵，有理講不淸」我祗好讓他兇一頓罷了。</p>
<p>宜春皮蛋，是浙贛路西段特產的一種，在過去價廉而又物美，我們去株州時聽說每枚售五萬元，這次回來，特在株州打聽，預備買點，回去給孩子們營養一番，不料三天的適去，就漲上一倍有奇，叫價十二萬，蛋舖還不願多賣，火腿亦被視爲至賓，買不到。據說株州到新喻一段，在金券未發行前，這裏的銀元，每枚才四百萬，現在提漲到六百萬，一切物價，是「奉公守法」的提漲三分之。縣政府的管制物價佈告，一直到現在，還沒見過一張。各地的米谷以及其他交易，用齣還是銀元多，金圓劵給老百姓的影響很好，但是，當地的銀行，還沒有開始代爲兌換。</p>
<p>一塊械鬥戰場，民間持有的武器，有步槍，手槍，手榴彈，還有迫擊砲，大砲，械鬥時雙方插旗擺陣，修築野戰工事，如臨大敵。去年分宜械鬥的時間，歴三四月之久，參加戰鬥的人數有四五縣之多，　　那票不　說了。有時縣長出馬予以制止，他們會很客氣的招待，但是，亦會暫時的借用縣長幣來彈壓的武器，打一塲惡戰，然後，再將原物奉還，老百姓自巳進幣武恭去參加一方的戰鬥的工價，是五塊光洋，沒槍的半價—二塊五角。</p>
<p>蘇州到南昌的交通，亦可說是浙贛路齣全綫通車，因爲樟樹大橋，所有　標，尚在加拿大，一再延期啓運，所以影響到全綫的運輸。路局原擬在樹樹大橋困難問題未解決前，搭築木質便橋，交通部認爲鋼樑可能在六月運到，所以未允所請，後來路局看到問題的解決，不甚容易，乃於大橋上游用輪波將西段急需的機東與車皮，輪送過去，並在門樓里開設車站。今後的客運準備在門樓里與樟樹東岸，交換乘軍，用輪濃</p>
<p>載送旅客過江，但貨車則用拖駁，這種費時費事的辦法，每一次渡江，就是風平浪靜，亦得二小時到二小時，若大水發風，費時恐怕更多，　局方面對着這種困難，現在又決定，在樟樹大橋的下游，搭築便橋，此次西去的考察團，亦曾到樟樹勘查，並由嚴鐵生副總工程同留在樟樹設法，據悉便橋的位置，決定在贛江下游，全長八百公尺，並須加築土方約五公里，另鋪軌道，全部的工程費，估計在二百億元左右，有三個月的時間，就可完成。但是，他們仍在眼巴巴的望着鋼棵的運到，否則，便橋到明春江水上漲後，行事又有間題，所以浙贛路全綫的暢通，須待兩三個月以後。</p>
<h3>南株段　若干難題　尚待解決</h3>
<p>南株段通學以後的困難問題，仍然須要設法去古服，下面提供的幾件，僅僅是記者這回在沿綫見聞所及的皮毛。</p>
<p>鋼貨問題樟樹大　與廠江支流，打撈工作，已經完成百分之五十，橋墩建築，亦已全部完成，正等待加拿大的鋼棵上架，但是，這批鋼貨，在半年前，就聽說快從加拿大啓運，所以當時路局方面計劃在樟樹搭架便橋，以備通車，交部卽信賴鋼標可以如期交貨，將路局的計劃否決，繼又着手在樟樹設擺渡，送車廂過江，所以現在將江西岸的一條綫，改舖到門樓里，用輸渡將急要的釘道材料和一些車皮，拖運過去，但是，事實告訴他們，每一次輪渡，從東岸到門樓里，要費時一小時半，再加上東岸的上船與西岸的上坡，就是平風息浪，亦得要兩小時，將來的貨運，在目前情珍下，是非將整車廂從此岸搬到彼岸不可，客運雖然兩岸預備了二列車互相迎接，但是客人們遇到在寒冬兩雪，戲是嬌陽施　的一天，那就吃不消，不但旅客會不同情路局的困難，同時過渡時候的秩序，恐亦將成大問題，何况在軍運繁忙的時候，那末站上的員工，更難應付。</p>
<p>從「浙　」東段來的朋友，都稱營此路「紅帽子」很規　的爲旅客們服務，但是，從鷹潭西來，在南昌的牛行，九江，萍鄉以至株州，却因爲地方勞，而使路局無法管理。譬如：　　的惡勢力，可以隨意向客人緊收起卸費，南昌牛行與九江都由常地的人們在把持，前昔時小港口一車的裝費，照路局的規定，不過三千多萬，而當地起卸夫的索價是三億，株州亦發生同樣的事件，起卸工作，是直接與旅客發生密切關係，假若他們不明瞭內情的話，當然要埋怨路局的辦理不善，但是事實却有內在的困難。</p>
<p>械門影響</p>
<p>南株段新喻以西到宜春以東的一段的老百姓，是以好械鬥而聞名，鄉間藏儲的武器，不但有長槍短槍，而且有迫擊砲。大砲，在他們械鬥時候的戰鬥者的工價，有槍的每日現洋五元，沒槍的每天規洋二元五角，假如是陣亡，還有優厚的安家費，地方武器齣雄厚，影響着地方的治安，時常發生械鬥，甚至掠刧。現在樟樹已是不斷發生，携帶武器，偷竊鐵路材料，新喻亦不時發生道釘與魚鱗板被竊，這些事件，都可能直接或間接影響到今後的行車。</p>
<p>現在路局正在設法，將上面一些困難，予以解決，同時他們更冀望地方的人士，給以同情的協助。</p>
<h3>限制金券進出口　港開始嚴格執行</h3>
<p>逾额款項一律沒收</p>
<p>〔本報香港卅日航訊〕改幣以來，金圓券進出口條例規定限额爲二十元，本月廿二日起，本港海關緝私處及碼頭車站警員，卽已開始執行嚴密檢查，廿八日上午，在啓德機塲內，檢獲遠犯條例携帶進出口金圓券限额之旅客二人，分別在九龍法庭判罰。（一）爲上海商人張公瑞，三十八歲，從上海乘中航機來港，抵達啓德機塲時，輯私員在被告之行李內，搜出金圓劵一百六十元。審訊結果，諭將逾須之金圓券一百六十元充公。（二）爲太古船務公司買辦黃培思，四十八歲，廿七晨十一時乘港航空公司客機離港前，爲緝私員三六二號在其身上搜獲金圓券二百八十七元六毫之庭論將擔保現款五十元及搜獲之金圓券一併充公。</p>
<h3>美菸之城貴定　繁榮黔省農村　趨向正常發展</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿七日航訊〕我國近今與河南囊城許昌，四川簡陽資陽齊名之貴州貴定美菸，早已爲經營菸草事業者所重視。自經前省主席楊森普遍提倡於前，現任谷正倫强調增產於後，以一貧瘠無聞四野荒僻之偏陬小縣，年來國家行局庫及商業行莊林立，人民　衣足食，生活享受提高，不特影響及於本省各縣盡力試種，促進美業界人士，亦紛紛派員來黔觀摩學習，哄動遐邇。本地捲姻工業因此得以日新月異，國家稅收亦復大量增加，各級政府與人民無不寄最大希望於美菸生產，故民國卅年前之貴州特產，當首推黃草壩之鴉片姻，三十年後之貴州特產，則貴定美菸已屬首屈一指。據貴州姻草公司經理方朝珩估計，卅六年之生產統計，全省收獲量約爲八萬担，而貴定一地則佔六萬餘担，以目前市價上金黃葉每百斤値法幣二億餘萬元計算，其總計數字，寗不驚人！據記者本年夏初美菸下種時際，到過貴定知道該縣實爲彈丸小城全縣面積僅一·九〇九·六〇平方公里，七·六三八·四〇平方市里，可耕地二·八六四·四〇市畝，現有人口一〇五·四〇五人，平均每平方公里約五十四人，惟以氣候寒溫適宜，雨量調匀，故極宜於農事生產。湘黔黔桂兩公路均橫貫縣境，軍運往來，多以縣城爲宿站，正在趕修中之湘桂黔鐵路都筑段，亦沿黔桂公路自西徂東，經過縣區，未來之鐵路車站卽在城北之桃花坪，縣境內各較大鄉鎮及與鄰近各縣城均有公路通車，對於菸農菸販之往來旅行，菸葉之吐納集散，頗稱方便。城內街道平坦，廠號隨處可見，有戲園，電影院。淸唱館，人民衣着較省會貴陽市爲普遍入時，對於賭與娼兩道，可算尤爲嗜好，市面所使用之大鈔，往往較貴陽市提早流涌，多爲國家行局或菸販遠至京滬專運而夾者，故生活特高，過其境者無不認爲此乃畸形發展之農村繁榮。</p>
<p>該縣自淸中葉以來，卽以出產料烟著稱，暢銷全省及湘桂川滇之一部，其所用原料卽土產之摺菸，味較本省其他菸葉及四川之金堂什　於菸葉爲淡。其種來自閩省，產區縱橫約二三百里。至於美種菸葉，則係民國二十九年由貴州企業公司總經理彭湖設法自美運來，交由貴州姻草公司與貴州農業改進所訂立推廣美種菸草合作辦法，由農改所派員指導，並約定過去栽種摺菸農戶配給種籽，授以播種育苗移植施肥諸法，鼔勵種植，旋以是年冰雹爲害，致遭挫折，故生產甚微，但其所獲菸葉，經公司方面試驗，色澤香味俱佳，與其他同種產品逈然有異。菸農方面亦覺以同量土地栽種美菸，較種摺菸收穫爲豐。姻草公司爲獎勵推廣，又不惜高價收購，宣傳所及，種植美菸者遂接踵而起，此後積年累月，力求改進，美菸在貴定，遂不脛而走，產量激增，今則關縣田野問，一片油綠，已成美菸世界矣。</p>
<p>美種菸葉以葉片寬大匀薄，葉脈　紐，無汽泡疤痕，色澤金黃，不油粘，不枯燥，氣味淸香爲上品，此雖於種植施肥烘烤發酵俱有關係，但氣候與土壤關係仍佔重要成份。貴定多砂質壤土，且氣候溫和，故適宜種植美菸，但所產產於葉亦有「內山」與「外山」之分，內山卽本縣腹地所產，週圍約二百餘平方公里，其所產菸葉，與原種無大歧異。外山出產則稍次，但亦較他縣所產爲優，熟於菸葉經營者，一見卽可判別。又內山菸葉與外山菸有一絕對無法冒僑之點，卽葉柄與梗分離處，凡外山外縣葉，其葉柄接頭處，必帶少數梗皮及脈筋，乾後柄頭均帶尖形。內山菸葉其摘頭處柄頭整齊，不帶反筋，烤乾後其柄頭鼓脹圓滑，有如　釘。此種內山菸葉，卽在踐定市場，每百斤價值亦常高出其他菸葉，菸廠多以此作高等捲烟之原料。菸農對於美菸之栽種移權煤烤，已積八九年之實地經驗，不特有關菸葉生長技術，巳且充分常識，卽氣候土壤，亦能知所擇別。農戶對於　菸技術，尤爲特別重視，惟設備不易，看火候尤難，但全縣菸農有烘房者，亦約有八千餘戶之多。貴定美菸，廿九年由貴州烟草公司倡導區植以來，產量激增。。</p>
<p>捲烟工業遂亦應運而興。初時除貴州姻草公司而外，另無大規模組織，卽有亦不過由淪陷區逃來之義民或傷殘休養之榮軍，用木製手工捲姻機在街頭巷尾零捲零售而已。故卅年貴定出產之美菸，仍由貴州姻草公司高價收購，至卅一，二，三，三年菸農激增，產量加多，卅四，卅五，卅六三年之間，因有政府對於改良品格，講求烘製技術，指導不遺餘力，同時對於菸農盡量扶助，舉辦合作貸款，以故產量益豐，於是卽目建烘房，而自辦苗圃，縣城之內，久大姻廠相繼成立，並同時向湘桂川三省外銷，其後有桂林一中拓製捲姻廠，桂林捲姻合作社遷來貴定，並在該地與貴陽設廠大量製造各牌香姻，其時因香港。廣州灣。滇緬路均阻却不通，外貨不能入口，各廠互相演進，品質裝璜，亦大加改良，手工捲烟遂漸受淘汰。迨至抗戰勝利前後，貴定曁貴陽各捲姻廠復加强向外省爭奪市塲，大量增產運銷川滇，及西南西北各省，如貴州烟草公司所出產之金鷹。企鵝，曾一度由昆明運往印緬，以質品優異，售價低康，到處受人歡迎。因是之故，國內各重要城市經營美菸實賣者卽　集貴定，目前除港·滬·寗·漢·桂·柳·長·衡·渝等地姻商，均在該縣縣城設有規模宏大之行莊而外，貴定菸商亦在滬·漢·穗·挂·湘·渝·設有行莊貨棧，每年由此包裝運出之菸葉約共五千餘車·城中尚有中國·金城·益記·湘南·時代·德成·其華等大同，競生·强華·三星·聚　華湘等捲姻工廠，出品精良，產量豐富，存貨堆積如山，喻爲「捲烟之市」，亦不爲過。</p>
<p>惟美種菸於葉，因播種移植，每易變質，且貴定菸農，急於近利，不知如何保藏原種不變，絕有殺雞求卵之勢。本年夏初播種之時，霪雨綿延，苗床大受影響，存活者難得一半，端午以後，正値菸苗發育生長，復受風雨摧殘，存活者亦華短葉稀。據有經驗方面之觀察與估計，如果天候不繼續放晴，本年貴定附近各縣美菸，每萬株可望收護可能烘製考難得三百斤，以此收益衡量本年菸農之年虧，恐今年之黃金菸葉美夢，當不如往年還甚。省府方面有鑒於此，近特飭由省農改所轉令產菸各縣選派對美菸種植具有經驗之農事人員來筑研習，美菸烘烤技術訓練班半年一期畢業之後，近復舉辦一年畢業之美菸種植技術訓練班，一面復授意貴州姻草公司，迅速籌辦分級。打包。烘烤等示範工作，俾能使此新興之農村副業，得循正常發展。關於美菸外銷工作，本省以年來菸農愚昧，不知愛惜聲譽，常好以外山菸冒充內山菸，或參入泥土河沙殘梗敗葉，使購者望而生厭，以致甫為人所重視之貴定美菸，致生厭，以致甫爲人所重視之貴定美菸，致遭市塲擯斥。省府方面近亦決定添置常設之檢定機關，經常辦理檢定。分級。化驗等事宜，以期出產合乎市場需要，嚴杜冒濫，提高品質。美菸種籽，美國政府已嚴禁出口，今後應如何保藏原種，改良品質，尚有待於我國之農事研究機關特加注意。</p>
<h3>浙贛路沿綫　煤藏豐富　一筆小統計</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌廿六日訊〕目前國內的重嬰煤源，如東北鞍山，本溪，北票，撫順，以及河北的開灤，井陘，河南的焦作，蘇北賈旺，魯南棗莊等礦，現皆橫遭破壞，或是被迫停工，今後的供煤，在黃河以北的匪患沒有元全肅淸以前，僅賴華中華南少數的礦產，實難維持整個工業之需，與京滬等大都市的民用，因此，今後的產煤重心，勢將移轉到長江以南地區。浙贛路目前最大任務，對於煤斤的供應，確是負荷着一個重任，所以它除了正綫的興修外，另有泉高與貴樂支綫的修築，這完全是爲了運煤。</p>
<p>現在浙贛路沿綫的煤藏量，據已經在開發，或是已採鑽紀錄來看，是有相當豐富的寶藏，如浙省境內的蘭溪礦區。面積爲七五九·二四公畝，蘿藏量約十餘萬噸，衢縣礦區，面積爲一，三八五〇·七公畝蘊藏量約數十萬噸，皆於抗戰期間悉爲敵軍摧毀，勝利迄今，尚無力恢復。</p>
<p>屬於贛省境內者，有萍鄉礦區，蘊藏量約達二〇〇，〇〇〇千噸，樂平，鄱陽兩縣煤藏量爲八〇，〇〇〇千噸，豐城煤藏量爲六〇，〇〇〇千噸，其他如上饒，宜春，新喻，進賢等縣，亦均有烟煤蘊藏，惜皆以土法開採，產量極徵。</p>

<h3>場上人影稀疏　米市入停滯狀態　雜糧交易零落油價再升</h3>
<p>米市交易，仍呈停滯狀態，市場之報價仍舊，但無交易做開，同業雖仍上市，因無交易，旋卽離去，市上人影稀疏，散市頗早。昨日到貨登記，南市七百十石，內包括地脚米四百八十石，北市到米九百七十三石，交易幾等於零。</p>
<p>麵粉依舊停頓未開，依小麥之到貨糧少，廠方因原料之難得，故不能供應市塲，按此情形，市塲交易暫難恢復，但廠方之配粉仍照常維持。</p>
<p>雜糧交易堆落，各糧均絕少做開，鄱陽子黃豆，開出二百包左右，太街競購，其他均爲零星交易。元麥開三十餘包，苞米亦略開出，菉豆紅糧未開，芝蔴交易尚多，生仁未開。</p>
<p>食油交易尚見興旺，豆油再升四五角，已迫近限度，價爲五十一元九角，廠方開出甚多，大統廠，中植等廠，均有開出。生菜油大有餘等廠，亦均有開出，價爲四十七元三角，亦迫限價。吉桶生油由齊魯公司搭熱菜油開出，凈生油平定，小車　油仍站限價。豆餅大統餅開四百片。</p>
<h3>海外需要殷切　茶市前途光明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃走訪茶葉鉅子朱錫金氏，據告：當本年外銷箱茶絡繹運滬之際，適値我國政府爲鼔勵出口，將外匯管制辦法，予以改篇結匯證明　之時，故頻將人心激挺，市况日見抬頭。迨至八一九，當局又宣佈改革幣制，並重定外匯，是以出口物資，得益更深，均見蓬勃氣象，而尤以茶葉，更因產量銳减，海外需求迫切，執貨者無不看好，觀其堅售心理，與二年前求售神情，幾不可同日而語，致價格方面，光芒四射。惟交易以吐納談判形成倒懸，做開未免狹隘，但前途勢必更將炫耀。至於紅綠茶內銷，本街與蘇錫各地，依然尚可，惟在有求必供中，一致盤旋原途。</p>
<h3>糧市再升</h3>
<p>食糖昨日塲內又以開放流言激衝，人心重告振奮，客帮頻來扒吸，本街亦起而添辦，喊價哄抬直上走勢殊爲堅挺。廿一期砂白棧單開後有買無賣，粗砂中砂亦見堅俏。四五號車白精初開市尚平穩，嗣以熱門各檔，齊步騰踊，價亦直綫上揚，興化赤因供售轉多，各帮納胃微細，市呈軟弱，其餘均挺升一元左右。</p>

<h3>行局庫放款利率　月息不得過三分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自改革幣制後，關於各行局庫放款利率，經四聯規定應自八月廿三日起依新辦法計算，最高不得超過月息三分。</p>

<h3>棉紗趨勢回疲　布疋一致向榮漲達限度</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開交易尚佳，買氣頗盛，各紗喊價齊登限綫。熱銷紗六十支天女一千二百八十五元，四十二支金雙鷄一千零六十元。嗣聞國民營紗廠將停止配於棉紗批發商之傳說，頓卽引起同業人心之不安，交易　轉淸稀，市亦回疲。</p>
<p>四十二支四十支卅二支等各細紗，及廿一支雙馬紗，行情俱在限綫徘徊，惟廿一支紗塲內供稀求多，價照限盤有成交。十六支十支等粗紗，走勢平凡，市在軟檔迥旋。紡建公司在塲開售二十支萬壽圖紗一種，價仍爲七百元，申購者限內衣·針織·巾被·手帕·帆布，及紗商登記之三〇　一至末號爲止。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，塲內買氣甚濃，人心激昂，塲上雖有永安紗廠開配大鵬細布，及紡建偱例配售，漲風仍難戢止，賣戶則取觀望</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布初開微挺一角，旋以本街店號競進，行情再升六角，有人買進，後有公會理事及永安紗廠，拋售細布及四君子金印元嗶嘰二千六百四十疋，午收回至廿八元四角結束，比上日步升五角之鉅。</p>
<p>龍頭D字及五福喇叭意等，甫開卽漲達限度，嗶嘰時値當令旺銷四君子白印嗶嘰金運妙舞跳鯉及二等品均有成交，行情因上日紡建公司配售頗多，僅四君子元嗶嘰軋好一角，其餘市呈堅穩，全日成交一千四百八十元。</p>
<p>又訊：永安紗廠昨在棉布市塲配售十二磅大鵬細布，（侮件二十疋草包）二千疋，侮疋配價爲二十八金圓，承購者可於三時前蓋章備條，註明會員號碼，申購核配，下週一（四日）公佈准配戶名，得配者，於翌日（五日）十時前，以行莊本票，加董背書，送交棉布公會換取棧單云。</p>

<h3>棉紡公會建議　全面聯購國棉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會昨下午二時起，召開臨時理監事會議。討論結果，通過對當局所決定之國棉重點聯購制，建議改爲全面聯購制。蓋重點聯購，僅限於上海·漢口兩地，則不在聯購地區之國棉，行市勢將混亂，且將促使聯購地區之棉花逃向非聯購地區，殊非上策。全面聯購，除上海，漢口兩地外，他如國棉重要據點南通，西安，沙市·寗彼·浦東·太嘉等區，均在聯購之列，以資劃一。聞該案係屬全面性，決定提交全國紗廠聯合會席上通過後，再向國棉聯購會建議採納施行云。</p>

<h3>找尋「北京人」　盟總與日方均查無下落　珍珍港事變爆發後　希世骸骨神秘失蹤</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京二日專電〕一九二六年於北平附近掘出之世界最古三人類祖先之一「北京人」骸骨，於一九四一年神秘失踪，或將永與世人別離。爲答覆最近中國駐日代表團請求協助尋找此古生物學之奇物，盟總民產監理處告中國代表團稱：「根據目前所得情報，無法作進一步之調查」。日民間財產局宣稱：一切冀求發現此稀世珍品下落之努力，俱屬無效。第一九四一年曾因中國局勞日趨惡化，擬將「北京人」運至美國保存，骸骨分裝三箱，名稱以ABC字樣，並已交擬自華北撒退之美海軍陸戰隊。不宰於同日珍珠港事變爆發，華北美罩被日軍拘留於秦皇島，此後「北京人」卽以失踪聞。日本民間財產局稱：復原局所作調查，顯示一九四一年十二月左右，駐於靑島之日軍，番號係廿七師十五旅團，然此旅團人員之姓名及現時住址，均無法查明。蓋有關之日期，已不詳悉。該局繼稱：該旅團是否與此事有關，現尚不知。並謂：復原局曾詢問下列各人：中村，島貫，塚本，渠等曾任華北日軍參謀，然亦均未能提供確實情報。</p>

<p>張小龍與蔡侯發，問爲硬派作風，對角抽射，球藝低急，第二盤之爭奪，更爲激烈，往後蔡以精力疲軟而致失敗，吳生康濟脆瀕亮，王妙松則爲牛皮糖作風，相形之下，妙松似稍差一着。今日小龍與生康之決賽，堪稱網球傑作，其精彩必勝過業餘公開賽陶葉之戰無疑。</p>

<p>前四塲爲落選賽，湘軍輪機均首次參加正式比賽，戰來格外認真，今晚爭奪必烈，繁星復興凱技術經驗，感感缺乏，希能參加三屆聯賽以求進益。　華全隊精神欠佳，往往七人應戰，今遇集賢恐遭淘汰，鐵馬實力可觀，首塲不幸敗於精武，取勝南友，當無問題。</p>
<p>錦標賽</p>
<p>錦標半複賽，屈臣氏迎戰青鋒，前者已安渡兩關，今晚再勝則參加奪標，頗俱希望，該隊將士用命，始終不懈，精神之佳，尤勝於球　。另冪聖約翰迎戰華隊，聖約翰儼然甲組隊伍，抱奪標雄心，華隊諸將實力亦不凡，今必予聖約翰以嚴重威脅。</p>

<h3>危機</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>我國四書五經以及老莊列子之屬之有英譯，乃所素知。　遊西書舖，見歐美人所著關於中國種種之著作圖册，直是　　屈指不可勝數，且發現屈原之　　有數種文字之譯本，司馬遷之史記有Edouard　Chavaanas君之法譯，關於呂不韋有Richard　Wilhelm君之德文專寫，乃不覺為之驚愕不止，喟然歏佩西人治學之動奮。</p>
<p>或謂此不足異，我國何嘗沒有歐美著作之中譯？</p>
<p>不錯。</p>
<p>可是把視綫擴大一點看，我國文化之現狀實有不容吾人樂觀處。譬如以英漢字典來說，在用功之勤，取材之宏一點論，我國現有的幾部就大都遠遜日人同類的出品，，日本人編的英和字典就多比我國的英漢字典為精審，為詳備。再掉過頭來看漢英字典：迄今為止，較為完備的漢英字典還是西人H．Giles及Mathew編著的二部。我國出版界刋行的漢英字典大都出於抄襲西火；雖是抄襲，而完備則不如。這類性質的著作，在歐美已日有改進，以言我國，仍是這原有的幾種。時至今日，索性連抄襲的刋印工作也做不起了。</p>
<p>再說：我國的「古」還是非中國人的史坦因輩先用科學方法考了去的；我國文字音韻還是非中國人的卡爾格林整理出一個科學系統來的。甚至我國有些古物古書古代字畫，你要查考賞鹽，也得遠涉重洋。試問我國有沙士比亞的手稿否？有拉斐爾，米凱朗奇羅，羅本斯輩的眞跡否？自外輸入的東西自然並非沒有，可是大部是些你我最感痛心，最覺要命的東西。事實如此，又何怪乎文化滾滾去，洋貨源源來呢？</p>
<p>這種「代庖」的狀態與西方文化蓬勃鼎盛的情形對比之下，其所表示的是什麽呢？</p>
<p>近期Listener週刋上載有一篇通論世界文明危機的文章，其大意：（一）文明是會死亡的；（二）文明死亡之主因是戰爭，羅馬帝國之滅亡卽其一例，此外過去已有二十餘種古代文明因此而衰退消滅；（三）戰禍到了某種程度，卽使一方潰敗，一方勝利，而獲致了統一的局面，然亦已無及，因此時雖已和平，然只是一種由於精疲力盡的和平，云云。這話令人聽了寒顫震恐，不只是悲哀而已的。</p>
<h3>美國的富翁區</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>百萬富翁在美國西南部的德克蕯斯和奧克拉荷馬兩州早已普通尋常，不足為奇了。這裏現在多的是家產五百萬美金的人，因為太多了，所以他們祗被認為「小康」而已。唯有當一個人積資達三千萬美金光景的時候，才被認為「豪當」。</p>
<p>德克薩斯州的石油商哈拉爾遜·韓特（Haralson　L．Hunt）可能是豪富之中最富者，也可能是美國人之中個人最有錢者，因為他習性喜靜，　惡攝影機，不愛招搖，所以默默無聞，甚至他的同鄉大多也不知道他、韓特所擁有的油礦財產，據估計値兩億六千三百萬美金左右。他每星期的總收入竟達一百多萬美金。</p>
<p>西南部的富翁之多，其數實足驚人。舉例來說，在華茲堡，報紙刊了一條新聞說：某一家族所繳納的一九四七年份的所得稅為三百四十四萬七千元。雖然有了這樣的綫索，讀者却還不能確切的猜凖「某家」到底是那一家，因為當地有需繳納如此鉅稅之可能的人家竟近乎二十個！</p>
<p>錢多，花費自然就奢侈。德州霍斯頓城的珠寳商不以一筆兩萬美金的買賣為難得。當地三家出售婦女用品的商店說銷售定價四百元到一千元的衣服並無困離·一個店舖新近擺出了四頂一千五百元一頂的黑貂皮的帽子，在第一天便傾銷一空。去年二月裏，達拉斯城的一家汽車公司在開張的第一夭便賣掉兩部每部定價近兩萬元的車子。另一家車商去年一年就買掉一千多部車子。</p>
<p>達城的尼曼瑪克司百貨商店有九萬個左右的記帳主顧，其中近乎三百個客戶一年惠顧五萬多元的生意，還有少數的主顧一年意買了十五萬元的東相！其奢華的情形，於此可見一斑。</p>
<h3>楊家將</h3>
<p>— 冀雲</p>
<p>楊家將故事，久經深入社會，婦孺皆知，尤其一般戲迷，對於程長庚之四郎探母。譚鑫培之李陵碑，以及楊家一切戲劇，倍覺言之津津，聽之有味，但按諸史實，頗有異同之處，略述如次：</p>
<p>（一）楊業：業卽李陵碑劇中之主要人物，今人所尊為楊令公者是也。本北漢名將，原稱劉繼業，北漢降後，猶據城苦戰，宋太宗命北漢主招之始降，復姓楊氏，止名業，拜代州刺史，以善戰名，時人號楊無敵。曾將數百騎，破契丹兵十萬，契丹每見其旌旗，卽畏走，後被王侁所害，迫令趨朔州，遇伏大敗，力戰被創數十，士卒殆盡，中箭墮馬被擒，不食而死。子延玉同戰死，麾下剩百餘人，敗時業令逃還，皆感激不退，亦同戰死。按諸李陵研劇情，雖不無多添枝葉，然大致似尙不悖。</p>
<p>（二）潘美：美為宋代名將，戰功極偉，俗稱奸賊潘仁美，或潘洪，諒卽影射美而言。按伐契丹時，美為都部署，業副之，所至克捷，値曹彬大軍潰敗，奉召還，時契丹勢盛，諸將皆棄城走，美往救亦敗，業以徒損兵益，主避其鋒，護軍下侁謂業素號無敵，不戰為有異志，不得已引兵趨朔州，並約美陳兵陳家谷口為援，美從之，契丹佯敗誘業，侁以爲勝，引兵前進爭功，嗣聞敗，卽引兵遁，美不能制。業戰至谷口，不見一兵，大慟再戰，遂被擒而死，可見害業者係侁，而以奸賊歸美，實有未符。（按侁甚奸險，並曾誣害田仁朗，業死，乃被除名。，</p>
<p>（三）楊延昭：延昭為業之子，俗稱楊六郎者是也，契丹大舉入寇，宋師潰敗，乘勝攻城，城小無備，衆心危懼，延昭集衆登陴固守，天大寒，汲水　城成氷，堅滑不得登，契丹乃引去。復選任邊將，命延昭知保州，時稱得人。</p>
<p>（四）蕭太后：后為契丹主賢之妻，隆緒之母，專政多年，有機智，善馭大臣，每戰親披甲督戰。復與宋通好，亦其主謀。惟殘忍好殺，與丞相韓德讓通，后死未幾，德讓亦死，陪葬陵旁。</p>
<p>按上史實，可見楊家將並非虛構，惟潘美不無寃誣，蕭后淫亂殘忍，與淸之西太后相類，然其武功政績，且死後其子隆緒，竟哀毀骨立以死，均為西后所不及也。</p>
<h3>秋日歸草堂</h3>
<p>— 陳定山</p>
<p>及門高柳斷橋西，拾級來登　可提，空會似聞烏雀樂，近人費蝶故飛低。</p>
<p>山間老桂全開未？屋裏家醅覆半黃，十日嬾睛睛朱凖，一香風雨展重陽。</p>
<p>米專羹滑似流，山偉先我稻梁謀，停盃試說身體健，意外新松雪蓋頭·（國中新雪雪松）</p>
<p>花關謝見空洲，短芡長　滿目秋，疑有新詩生眼底，垂楊　隔一重愁。</p>
<h3>烈豆</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>淤泥不染，運有君子之稱；晚節獨標，菊為高人所尙。疾風勁草，歲寒松柏，要皆物類之可貴者也。而綠豆中亦有所謂「烈豆」者，明鄭二陽云：「煮綠豆中往往有煮之不爛者，人皆名為烈豆，亦日鐵豆，其名甚佳。夫以猛火沸湯之中，諸豆盡皆糜爛，而此豆獨能堅挺如鐵，完好目若，毫不為損，眞可謂入水不濡，入火不焚者矣。稱之曰烈，宜哉！……每謂世道雖大壤極敝時，定有不敝不壤處，正賴尋常耳目赫奕外，自有一輩皿性漢在。未可謂一片清明世界，遂爲欲乘鶴軒而頂猴冠者　料盡壞。」</p>
<p>夫以猛火沸湯之中，不隨諸豆糜爛，獨能堅挺完好，稱之為烈，誰日不宜。從知坎壈艱危，實為人類大好之試金石。而「世道雖大壤極敝時，定有不敝不壞處」，此歷史之所以綿延，忠義節烈特立獨行之士史不絕書，正賴尋常耳目赫奕外有此輩血件漢子，為天地留一股正氣也。</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>

<p>美國加州南部，有一條世界最大自來水管，總管長二四二哩，大部管內可以行駛汽車，用來供給十三個市市民的飲料，每天供給一〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇加侖水量。</p>
<p>一隻蜂雀在飛行時，每秒鐘共扇動兩翼七十五次，翱翔時每秒鎗四十次，這是根據高速度攝影機的計數而得。</p>
<p>全世界發明家最多的國家，誰都以為非美國卽德國，其實，以人口為比例，發明家最多的是瑞士。</p>
<p>美國的黃石公園，占地三千五百平方哩，園內以溫泉一種而言，已有二三百處。風景的雄壯美麗，令人驚嘆！</p>
<h3>好人與壞人</h3>
<p>— 爾佳</p>
<p>武三思云：「我不知世人何者為善人，何者為惡人；但與我善者卽善人，與我惡者卽惡人。「袁簡齋云：「此種見解，今之賢人君子往往皆然，即古之程朱亦未免蹈此病，第不肯如武三思之直捷說出耳。」卽以三思此語看今天，仍覺新鮮可喜。</p>
<h3>明哲保身的限度</h3>
<p>— 爾佳</p>
<p>明楊激明良記載云：「錢方伯為御史時，抄沒中官王振家產，內有金鑄觀音一座，背識云：孝孫周忱拜奉，蓋文襄公所獻也。」注云：「此與謝太傅忍飢倦見桓溫相類，豈以明哲保身，不惜小挫耶？」</p>
<p>實在君子之「以明哲保身」，亦不可太失氣節，如陳太邱之弔張讓，杜征南之賂朝臣，是皆不失明哲保身之意。若周忱之進奉王忱而稱「孝孫」，此謟媚之最下，與吮　舐痔無異，豈得與謝太傳之忍飢倦見相比，而僅謂之「小挫」哉？</p>
<p>至於以明哲保身為藉口，作漢奸，受不義之財等等，更是不在話下的了。</p>
<h3>讀邱吉爾回憶錄</h3>
<p>— 樂志</p>
<p>邱氏這部書英文號為名著，商務譯本與原文我都曾粗讀一過。英國在二次大戰中所處地位頗為艱苦，邱氏一身當重任，功成身退，自然有許多懲前瑟後垂訓將來的話。他這部書不是隨便作的，全書的微意，不在乎追咎從前的養　貽患，而在提醒世人以政治究竟不是埋性的而是感情的，惟其不是理性的，所以覆轍相尋，明知故犯；照這樣下去，依然世界　序不能有保障，也就是人類的政治理想，還沒有發揮到盡善的境界，而且綜合古往今來表里動靜的各方面來看，人類是不是良好的具有政治能力的生物，都還是疑問。讀邱氏之書，不為往者悲，而更為來者懼也。</p>
<p>他說：英國的民族性是愛和平的，但是遇着危險到來，越危險越鎭靜，越堅不可拔。這話一定很對，然而世上每一民族都有他的民族特性，怎樣能了解每一民族的特性，而使之平流共進呢？德國人若早了解英國的特性，大約不致發動對波蘭的軍事，那還有免除或延遲戰事至數年以後再開始之可能，希特勒誤認張伯倫是個老實可欺的，所以敢於冒大險。這大概是邱氏要說明的意思。在第二次大戰的初期中，英國是主，美國是從，大戰後的情形，可是美國為主，英國為從了，當日德國誤認英美為軟弱，一步一步的嘗試，曾幾何時，又有人誤認英美為軟弱，一步一步的嘗試了。一九三九年以前的局勢，誰能斷定英美到何時方才起來拿武器呢？邱氏說歷史的兩頁，不會全然一樣的，總有些不節的不同。這話何等的深婉悲痛？小節是不同，而大的窠臼，簡直是循環相襲的了。</p>
<p>不獨戰爭，卽平時的政治經濟文化各問題，從前是那樣的，現在還是那樣，甚至幾百年的問題，依然沒有改善。歐洲的各民族，有許多先天的難題，總不能解決，甚至本身的缺點，也始終不能改善。在危險的時候，一陣着急；事過境遷，，依然故我。邱氏所述各項情節，對於他英國的友邦，以及異國，措詞自然很含蓄，不肯揭人之短，然而也够看出他們的腐敗了。以英國而論，　的政治制度確實是比別國健全，堪以持危應變，社會一般情狀也是不媿能忍辱負重死裏求生的，邱氏完全代表英國的政治家，他的相業，令人起敬，但是英國的立塲是不許有一國過於强大，而又要有些國强大得剛好替她看門，這種兩　的題目，怎樣做得好呢？</p>
<p>譯本相當條暢，尤其衆手合成而不見前後不一致的痕迹，簡直如出一手，是很難能可貴的。但原文有些情文相生的婉妙地方，還不能表達恰當，因此想到我們現在通行的文體，除說明式的文字以外，似乎還嫌貧乏單調，不敎曲折豐富。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 2nd] Qian Suo Railway Station outside Shanhaiguan was attacked by over 10,000 communist troops on the 1st, resulting in fierce fighting with the defending forces.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, February] The battle around Yuguan has unfolded. The fighting in Wanjia Village continues. East of Yuguan, telephone lines are only connected to Xiaotun Mountain.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Branch of Our Telecommunications Bureau Forced to Cease Operations; Hong Kong Government No Longer Leases Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 2nd] The Hong Kong branch of our Telecommunications Bureau, with a 60-year history here, has ceased operations under public scrutiny. The branch announced that the Hong Kong government has decided not to continue leasing the landline telephone lines from Hong Kong to Shenzhen (located on the border between Kowloon and Guangdong) to our government, forcing the bureau to close down. Before the war, the bureau transmitted telegrams through submarine cables and radio companies, paying according to the number of words. For a short period after the war, the bureau felt it was inconvenient to transmit telegrams through submarine cables and radio companies, and once set up its own radio station, but gave up due to protests from the Hong Kong government. The bureau then leased landline telephone lines in the British zone from the Hong Kong government to conduct business. Now that these landline telephone lines have been deprived, the Hong Kong branch of our Telecommunications Bureau has been forced to cease operations. According to personnel from the Submarine Telegraph and Wireless Company, our government can account for two-thirds of the telegrams sent to southern China by the company in the future.</p>

<h3>National Enemy and Puppet Property Valued at Over US$100 Million; Measures for Various Agencies to Finalize the Takeover of Enemy and Puppet Property Approved; He Hao-ruo Will Visit Various Locations for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property nationwide will form part of the gold yuan issuance reserve, amounting to a considerable sum. According to cleaning-up agencies in various locations, the total value of enemy and puppet property already cleared and with confirmed ownership, ready for immediate sale, reaches 332.74 million gold yuan, equivalent to US$83.185 million. This excludes over 50 million gold yuan of enemy and puppet property in the Northeast region already valued and awaiting sale, as well as a large amount of enemy and puppet materials that can be processed and sold to finalize cases, all of which are not included. Therefore, the total value of the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property nationwide will exceed US$100 million. Of the currently estimated 330 million gold yuan of enemy and puppet property, real estate accounts for the largest proportion, approximately 70% of the total. Regionally, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area accounts for the most, reaching over 150 million gold yuan. The Hebei-Tianjin area accounts for over 87 million gold yuan. The Shandong-Qingdao area accounts for over 40 million gold yuan, the Wuhan area accounts for over 40 million gold yuan, and the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian area accounts for over 11 million gold yuan. The Henan area accounts for over 2.5 million gold yuan.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Executive Yuan's review meeting on handling enemy and puppet property continued on the 2nd, presided over by Chairman He Hao-ruo. Representatives from relevant central ministries and commissions, as well as responsible persons from enemy and puppet property handling agencies nationwide, attended. The morning session discussed proposals, passing the report of the First Review Subcommittee, which included three proposals: (A) Regarding the enemy and puppet materials received and used by local government agencies, many are untraceable or uncollectible, proposing measures for finalizing cases. The measures are as follows: (1) If the provincial government proves that the enemy and puppet materials received and used by local agencies were indeed for official use at the time, and the quantity and value are not significant, the handling agency shall be allowed to close the case at its discretion. (2) If the quantity and value of enemy and puppet materials received and used by local agencies for official use are substantial, the handling agency shall compile the case and submit it to the Executive Yuan for deduction from subsidies to local finances or approval for additional budget transfers to close the case. (3) Enemy and puppet materials received by various agencies but not yet used shall still be handed over for processing. (4) Enemy alien property received by local agencies, which after repeated investigations, or due to the passage of time, changes in leadership, reorganization, cancellation, or the absence of original inventory lists or receipts for verification, remain untraceable, shall be listed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval of write-off.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding how to value and account for enemy and puppet property received by various agencies and military organizations according to law, and how to urge collection and finalize cases, proposing measures: (1) Factories and equipment allocated to state-owned enterprises for operation shall be listed by the handling agencies in each region and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The valuation standard shall be transferred and finalized by the end of this year. Any profits earned over the years shall also be documented and handed over to the handling agency for transfer to the national treasury. (2) Enemy and puppet property received by various government agencies and military organizations, which has not been transferred for handling or valued for liquidation, shall be strictly reviewed to determine which must be retained and which are unnecessary. Those that must be retained shall be transferred and accounted for at the assessed value within a limited time, and those that are unnecessary shall be ordered to be transferred for handling.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the request for expedited transfer procedures for enemy and puppet property received and retained by various agencies.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Second Review Subcommittee report was discussed, and He Hao-ruo's opinion was used as the conclusion for the handling of enemy and puppet property in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, serving as a principle for handling enemy and puppet property in those areas. He Hao-ruo stated: "The situation in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places is indeed unique, but compared to the Northeast, it can be said to be a relatively favorable place. Funds from the Northeast entering through the port will inevitably pass through Tianjin and seek an outlet. If they can be properly guided, they may be brought back on the right track. If the enemy property houses that are highly suitable for reuse are fairly priced and buyers are guaranteed the right to manage them, they will be happy to purchase enemy and puppet property. If local agencies feel limited by their own authority, a supervisory committee for handling enemy and puppet property should be organized in each area, composed of local senior military and political leaders, responsible for supervising the implementation of bidding, sales, and clearance. The handling agency should have the courage to take responsibility and boldly proceed." Finally, the "Draft Measures for Accelerating the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate" proposed by the Third Review Subcommittee was also revised and approved.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] He Hao-ruo, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property, in order to strengthen the handling of enemy and puppet property in various regions and supervise the rapid sale of enemy and puppet property in those regions, is scheduled to depart around the 15th of this month to inspect and supervise various locations across the country. He Hao-ruo's itinerary will first take him to Qingdao, then to Tianjin and finally to the Northeast. He will return to Nanjing in early next month and then inspect Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and southern China. According to He Hao-ruo, he will handle this enemy and puppet property with a spirit of great fearlessness. The enemy and puppet property in the foreign concessions in various places must be sold first, and he will complete this work with the greatest determination within six months.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum: The Kuomintang and the Status Quo in China</h3>
<p>— Mao Zi-shui</p>
<p>It has been over twenty years since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. During these twenty-plus years, except for the last year, the central government of China has nominally been led by the Kuomintang (KMT). However, internal strife and foreign aggression have emerged one after another, the people's livelihood has deteriorated daily, and the national situation has become increasingly precarious. As a result, most people who discuss national affairs criticize the KMT. Even the more enlightened members of the KMT believe that they are duty-bound and have brought this upon themselves.</p>
<p>I believe that to determine the KMT's responsibility for the current state of China, we must first understand the source of this state. The most recent, greatest, and most obvious reason for the dire situation our country is in now is, of course, the civil war. Because of the civil war, transportation has been disrupted, land has been devastated, prices have soared, and the majority of the people live in fear of going without food and clothing.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the KMT government is good or bad, I have never considered placing the responsibility for the civil war on the KMT. First, the civil war in China was caused by the Communist Party's use of force to seize political power. The National Government is recognized by all countries in the world – including the Soviet Union – as the official government of China. Any government has the right to use force to suppress any rebellion, and it should do so. Second, the Communist Party's goal is to rule the world. No matter how much the central government compromises or tolerates, the Chinese Communist Party, if it is qualified to be called a Communist Party, will never abandon force and sincerely seek domestic peace. The many weaknesses in the central government are, of course, topics for the Communist Party to call for revolution. In fact, no matter how wise the government is, if it is not a Communist Party government, or even if it is a Communist Party government but does not belong to the direct line of Lenin and Stalin, it will be denounced as reactionary and overthrown by the adherents of the current Communist Information Bureau. I think honest people within the Chinese Communist Party will not deny this. Given this, would it not be too unjust if we placed the responsibility for the civil war on the National Government?</p>
<p>Some people believe that the prolongation of the civil war, the suffering of the people, and the central government's inability to quickly quell the chaos mean that it has lost its qualification to be a government, and that this is all due to the KMT's incompetence. I believe that there are two major reasons for the growth of the Chinese Communist Party. One is Japan's invasion of China, which prevented the central government from attending to the Communist Party. The second is the Yalta Conference, where Mr. Roosevelt misjudged people and insisted that Soviet Russia quickly declare war on Japan, resulting in that secret agreement that harmed others and benefited no one. After Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union gave the weapons it received from the Kwantung Army to the Chinese Communist forces. Such powerful bandits, of course, could not be quelled in a short period of time. If we consider the government's inability to quickly quell the chaos to be the KMT's incompetence, the KMT can also offer the following self-praise to resist our slander:</p>
<p>"If it were not for the efforts of the National Government, China would have been swallowed up by Japan long before the Americans defeated Japan. If the KMT did not put in a great deal of effort and take on the responsibility of the nation's survival, China might have been under the control of the Communist Information Bureau!"</p>
<p>A fair-minded person, if not a believer in the Communist Party, cannot completely deny this self-assertion of the KMT.</p>
<p>At this point, some may suspect that I am deliberately defending the KMT. I can clearly tell everyone that my motivation for writing this article is to defend the KMT. I know that this seems to be inviting public anger. Public anger is certainly terrifying, but I admire Mr. Lü Xinwu of the Ming Dynasty's saying: "Defending people against injustice and slander is the first principle of heaven." I would rather offend the public than violate the principles of heaven. If I knew that the world was unjustly accusing the Communist Party, I would also not be afraid of public anger to defend the Communist Party. (For the convenience of readers, I would like to declare that I am neither a member of the Communist Party nor a member of the Kuomintang.)</p>
<p>A person is often very forgiving of the shortcomings of scientists or artists when criticizing them, but when he criticizes politicians, he nitpicks and is completely unforgiving. This is really very unfair. I believe that being a politician is the most difficult thing in the world. A scientist works in the laboratory all day long, and no matter how hard he works, he always has a place to enjoy himself. A politician often exhausts himself for the sake of human progress and human happiness, and sometimes he is subjected to unexpected adversity. Only a person with great benevolence and courage would be willing to do such a thing. (The politicians I am talking about here, of course, refer to those who have a "compassionate heart for the people" and take "improving the world and educating people" as their career. Those who steal power and deceive the people to satisfy their own selfish desires are no different from thieves. Most of the warlords in China in the past were such people: they cannot be considered politicians at all.) Therefore, we should have a little extra respect for those who are engaged in politics. Of course, we should also correct the mistakes of politicians without hesitation. You must always be mindful of the hard work of the servants in your home, but you can also point out their faults. If he accidentally and unintentionally makes a mistake, you will severely punish him. I am afraid that this is not the way a gentleman treats his servants. I hope that gentlemen who talk about politics should at least have the attitude of treating servants toward those who are truly engaged in politics. That is why I do not easily scold those who are engaged in politics.</p>
<p>The biggest accusation against the KMT, which is why it is scolded by the world, is that it has been in power for more than twenty years, shouting the Three Principles of the People every day, and still has not done a good job for the people. This seems to be something that should be scolded. But I don't dare to scold casually. Think about it. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, there was first the revolt of the Communist forces in Jiangxi, then the revolt of Feng and Yan in the north, and soon there was the September 18th Incident, the Shanghai War, and the revolt of the "People's Government," and so on. After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese warlords wantonly invaded, and the Communist Party army took the opportunity to spread to the northern provinces. In the midst of these internal and external troubles, it would be very good if the National Government did not collapse. How can we expect it to do anything? A country bumpkin complains about everything as soon as he is unhappy. When someone steals a chicken from him, he opens his mouth and scolds the government for being corrupt. We need to have a historical perspective, so although we cannot praise the government for the current state of China, we also cannot scold it as casually as a country bumpkin.</p>
<p>In all fairness, in the past twenty years, although there have been some narrow-minded people in the KMT who promoted governing the country by the party, in fact, few of the heads of the National Government's administration were old KMT members. Of these people, the "social notables" were certainly unrelated to the party. Even the true party members mostly focused on the country and the people, and did not focus on the party. Therefore, from the party's point of view, the KMT has failed. From the country's point of view, although the KMT has not made any great achievements, it is at least worthy of the assessment of "understanding the big picture."</p>
<p>Recently, domestic newspapers and magazines have often discussed or criticized the KMT, both party members and non-party members. Many of the points are very correct, but they seem to rarely be based on a historical point of view. I am now purely from the perspective of political history to discuss the view we should take regarding the relationship between the KMT and the current state of China. I hope that our young intellectuals or old debaters, from handling family affairs to criticizing the gains and losses of political affairs, should have the heart to blame others lightly and blame themselves heavily, so as not to lose the style of a great power. Our nation has a tradition of two or three thousand years of "culture." Our political demeanor must strive to catch up with the British, or at least catch up with the Americans. Like the French, when the country is in crisis, they still fight and quarrel endlessly. We should take such a nation as a warning! Other more base and inferior nations are engaged in mutual "revolution" or "party purification" every day. We do not need to imitate them! (Sent from the Department of History, Peking University)</p>

<h3>Gannan Intensifies the Delivery of Military Grain; Grain Outflow Will Be Further Restricted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang Dispatch, 2nd] Jiangxi is concentrating its efforts on handling the delivery of military grain. In September, the central government limited the delivery to 150,000 packages, but only a little over 114,000 packages were delivered.

<h3>Reasons for Not Prosecuting Yuan Yang'an</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Capital District Prosecutor's Office has decided not to prosecute lawyer Yuan Yang'an, who was implicated in the case of leaking confidential information about currency reform and selling Yongsha stocks for profit. The reasons stated in the non-prosecution decision are as follows: According to the case, the facts of the crime should be determined based on evidence, and if there is insufficient suspicion of a crime, a decision of non-prosecution should be made, as clearly stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. In this case, the defendant Yuan Yang'an, after being reported by the Capital Police Department as being suspected of benefiting from the opportunity of currency reform with Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming, was sent together with Xu Baiqi and others for investigation. During the interrogation, the defendant firmly denied having jointly sold Yongsha stocks with Tao Qiming and Xu Baiqi or having taken advantage of the opportunity to make a profit. Furthermore, during the investigation by the Capital Police Department and this court, through separate interrogations and cross-examination of the testimonies of the co-defendants Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming, it was found that they were consistent with the defendant's defense. It is evident that the defendant did not obtain any illegal gains under the instigation of the co-defendant Xu Baiqi and others. In addition, after repeated investigations by this court, there is no other evidence sufficient to prove that the defendant did indeed engage in joint profiteering. It is difficult to hastily convict him. Except for the embezzlement by Tao Qiming and Xu Baiqi, which will be prosecuted separately, the decision of non-prosecution is made in accordance with Article 331, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<h3>Stalemate in Atomic Energy Negotiations May Be Broken; Soviet Union Puts Forward New Proposal; Advocates International Convention; Banning Atomic Weapons and Establishing Control Mechanism to Proceed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[News Report] Paris, 2nd, Broadcast: There has been a significant shift in the Soviet Union's atomic energy policy, abandoning its original demand to first destroy and ban all atomic weapons before establishing an international control mechanism, and instead proposing to simultaneously ban atomic weapons and establish an international atomic energy control mechanism. On the 2nd, Vyshinsky formally suggested the drafting of two conventions, one for banning atomic weapons and one for establishing an international control mechanism, to be signed and implemented simultaneously. According to this method, the Atomic Energy Commission will continue negotiations. General observations suggest that the shift in Soviet policy is unlikely to greatly assist in promoting coordination between the East and West.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] On the 2nd, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries continued to attack the United States' atomic control plan. The Yugoslav representative, Mr. Berle, accused Western countries in the United Nations Political Committee of wielding the atomic sword as a diplomatic weapon. Mr. Berle also claimed that the United States had drafted a control plan with the intention of making it unacceptable to the Soviet Union. He said that anyone with a little reason would know that the US plan was to ensure that the United States permanently maintains its monopoly on atomic bombs and is not fooled. Although the South Communist Party's henchmen have been expelled by the Communist Information Bureau, Mr. Berle's position is in line with Soviet diplomacy. He rebutted British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement that the Soviet Union should be blamed if the world falls into an atomic war, and said that if the West rejects the Soviet Union's plan, it should bear the responsibility for all the consequences. Mr. Berle and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky also implied that the Soviet Union already possessed atomic bombs, saying, "Except for international collective cooperation, we are unwilling to give up even a shred of sovereignty. But when will large American enterprises begin to seek benefits for the world and become interested in collective cooperation? Most countries in the United Nations recognize that forcing a country possessing atomic bombs to destroy its atomic bomb stockpile is a dangerous thing. We can bet 100 to 1 that the majority will do everything possible to hinder the passage of the Soviet plan. This move creates pressure on the Soviet Union, which is generally believed not to have atomic bombs, or at least not to possess them in quantities comparable to the United States." At the end of Mr. Berle's speech, he called on Western countries to support the Soviet plan to ban atomic bombs and destroy the atomic bombs stored in American arsenals. He said that this move could save the world from falling into the abyss of war. French Defense Minister Lemari spoke next, stating that France fully supports the Belgian representative's proposal to establish a small committee with the power to conduct negotiations and strive to reach an agreement. He also issued a warning to the Soviet Union, stating that since the Soviet Union may already have atomic bombs, international control, inspection, and investigation are inevitable. Mr. Lemari said that if the United States is required to destroy all atomic bombs before an international control and monitoring system is established, this would be tantamount to transferring the atomic monopoly from the United States to the hands of swindlers. He was responding to Vyshinsky and Berle's claim that the American monopoly was an illusion. After Mr. Lemari spoke, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky angrily rebuked Mr. Lemari for adhering to the atomic policy of his American masters and rejecting his appeal. The masters of Mr. Lemari mentioned by Vyshinsky included Lilienthal, Truman, and Schuman.</p>
<h3>Military Aid to Western European Alliance; United States Considers New Lease Act; Agreement for US Use of Western Air Force Bases Has Been Established</h3>

If those who advocate the lease plan prevail, the plan will be submitted to Congress next spring, but before that, the following must occur: (1) The organization of the Western European military alliance must be completed first. The alliance is composed of the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and is currently meeting in London. Marshal Montgomery has been nominated as commander. (2) The alliance must determine what it needs, what military equipment it can afford itself, and what it should apply for from the United States. (3) The President and the National Security Council should determine whether military assistance is the best security arrangement for the United States. (3) Should determine what Europe can help in the US national defense. It is said that a member of the State Department is the main supporter of the lease bill, and there are also many supporters in the national military organization.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] Political commentators here pointed out that the temporary military group established by the five Western European countries is neither a joint military staff nor a unified command. Its main goal is to coordinate all preparatory plans, especially the production and purchase of war materials used for the defense of the five countries. There are two other basic goals that are the work of the governments: (1) The Old Continent cannot place its defense under the complete control of the American army, but must rely on its own efforts. (2) Cooperation between Western European countries cannot be regarded as sufficient to provide the five countries with sufficient strength to guarantee their security. In the event of economic and political events, the United States must be asked for assistance. Economically, the United States is now raising huge sums of money to arm itself and to provide economic assistance to Europe, so the new lease system must not undermine either of these two goals. Politically, the new Congress' review of military assistance to Europe will be tantamount to turning the Western European alliance into an Atlantic alliance. The new Congress is about to convene to decide whether Western Europe should be defended, or only given assistance, or completely abandoned and ignored.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] According to a telegram from the "Daily Mail" Washington correspondent, the Spanish air force bases will also be included in the Western defense plan drafted by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.

According to the "Daily Mail", the United States and Spain have concluded an agreement on this matter.</p>

<h3>United States Strives to Clear Obstacles to International Freedom of the Press; Marshall Issues Statement Commemorating Newspaper Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall stated today that the United States government is actively working to clear obstacles preventing the free flow of news around the world. The Secretary of State's statement was issued by the State Department to commemorate National Newspaper Week, which begins today. In his statement, Marshall pointed out that half of the world's population lives under some form of censorship. Some countries implement censorship systems, and news is controlled by the government. The people of these countries are not allowed to know the truth, and their judgments are based solely on the half-truths or fabricated reports instilled by their rulers. News censorship and control are the first and most important steps for a dictator to conquer the people. The American people should always remember that once everyone has freedom of the press, their freedom will never be lost.</p>

In the resolution, the board members called for the focus in the future to be a comprehensive and open discussion of international financial issues between the board member countries. Some directors condemned the procedures of the meeting based on the fact that most of the discussion time during this session was limited to approving the policies recommended by the executive directors of the two associations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder praised Chinese Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu, saying that during China's economic difficulties, Wang abandoned his personal business and took on the battle as China's Finance Minister. Snyder stated at a press conference that the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund's board of directors were deeply gratified by the progress of world recovery.

<h3>Incident at the United Nations General Assembly; Vyshinsky's Intelligence is Inaccurate; Civilian Map Mistaken for Military Use</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 1st] In a passionate speech at the United Nations General Assembly a few days ago, Soviet representative Vyshinsky mistakenly used a chart from an oil company as a "Map of the Pacific Theater of the Third World War" by the United States. The "New York Times" editorial today had the following description of it: "If this represents the intelligence that the Russians have obtained from heaven, then the quality of the spies they hire is actually inferior to those summoned by the Senate Thomas Committee. The map pointed to by Vyshinsky is not a map of the Third World War, but a map of the Second World War printed three or four years ago. Esso Company is a private company that printed it. Naturally, Vyshinsky would ask, 'If this cannot prove that the United States is planning to attack the Soviet Union from New Guinea Tarawa, what can prove it?' Vyshinsky accused the United States of planning a war against the Soviet Union. Our journalists and the "Voice of America" broadcast should repeatedly remind the people of the world that the American people are tired of any war against the Soviet Union or any other country."</p>

<h3>Sufficient Stock, No Food Worries; Management Authorities Release Preliminary Statistics; Direct Distribution of Yarn and Cloth Eliminates Market; Continued Rice Rationing, No Consideration of Price Increase; Citizens Can Buy 1.5 Zhang of Cloth Every Three Months with ID Card</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the Supervision Office, preliminary statistics show that there are 6.5 million bolts of cloth and 100,000 bales of yarn in the city. In addition to self-sufficiency, there is still a surplus to supply to other areas. In the future, it is planned to gradually eliminate yarn and cloth middlemen and fully adopt a direct distribution system. When the reproduction industry needs yarn, it can directly purchase from the yarn factory without going through middlemen. When other cities and regions need yarn, they can apply to the local guild, which will then request to purchase it from the guild in this city. As for the goods needed by yarn shops in this city, they can request the factory to allocate them. In the future, citizens can buy 1.5 zhang of cloth every three months with their ID cards. This planned management can rationalize and economize the consumption of yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Rice rationing in Shanghai will continue. According to Yang Chuoan, there will be no problem with the rice supply for the next four months: October, November, December. The current rice storage in Shanghai's rice industry is 280,000 dan, not including the grain stored by residents, so there is no famine in the city. As for the rice merchants' request to increase the selling price, the Supervision Office decided not to consider it. To increase supply, the Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Bank have been asked to purchase grain from Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places to supply Shanghai, and consider exchanging cloth and soap produced in Shanghai for grain from other cities. Currently, there may be hoarding by large households in cities and towns everywhere, resulting in a small amount of rice coming in. In the future, after the powers of the Supervisor are expanded, the unified control of grain will be discussed with the provincial and municipal authorities to completely solve the problem of grain hoarding by large households in the short term. At the same time, the government is also planning to improve the rice distribution work of the People's Livelihood Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu Guozhen visited Jiang Jingguo yesterday morning to discuss the adjustment and control of rice and cloth in the future. Supervisor Jiang convened Wu Weijing, deputy manager of the Textile Construction, Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Shanghai Textile Industry Association, Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association, and Dong Jiufeng, chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, yesterday morning to discuss the issue of controlling yarn and cloth prices. It was decided that the yarn and cloth market would be closed starting next week and a direct distribution system would be implemented. It was heard that Mr. Jiang stated on the spot that since the yarn market is supplied at a limited price, there should be no more situations in the market that do not comply with the limited price. In the future, due to the relationship of using US-aided cotton, the Central Bank should also have a large amount of cotton yarn available for supply, so the principle of yarn and cloth supply in the future will be that each factory directly distributes and sells to the cotton yarn reproduction industry, retail merchants, and distributors in other cities, etc., to avoid being affected by the yarn and cloth market fluctuations. As for the yarn and cloth industry association, if it also originally had transactions of selling yarn and cloth to other cities, it can form a small institution to plan and handle it separately. Mr. Jiang ordered the responsible persons of the yarn and cloth industry associations to quickly convene their colleagues to draft a method.</p>
<p>[Another News] Jiang Jingguo also received Yang Chuoan, the chairman of the Emergency Grain Purchase Committee, and Wan Molin yesterday, and decided that the selling price of rice in the city would not change, and planned to exchange industrial products for food from other regions, and major grain hoarders in cities and towns would be banned.</p>

Ms. Dang is known to all as the female performer Ms. Wang Xunheng, whom Zhang admired greatly during his lifetime. Three days before his arrest, he planned to divorce his wife and marry Wang. After entering prison, he still wrote poems to express his feelings, such as: "Autumn rains fall day after day, pitying the tears that gush like springs. When will we hold hands again, picking flowers and watching butterflies dance?" The feelings of love and longing are evident on paper. After Zhang's death, there was much discussion about Ms. Wang in the outside world. Yesterday, a reporter visited Zhang's wife at Zhang's residence on Xinzha Road, and saw the iron door tightly closed and the courtyard deserted. In the reception room, there was a spiritual tablet and portrait of Zhang, with dim lighting and a desolate silence. However, the vermilion lacquered pillars and the strings of red, green, and colored small light bulbs on the ceiling still evoked the luxurious splendor of the past, when guests gathered and shadows danced. Zhang's wife, described as haggard, said that Ms. Yi had not yet visited her, so she had to keep the belongings for a long time. She said that she and Zhang were classmates at the police academy and had been married for four years and had a daughter. Zhang was originally a promising young man with talent, but after coming to Shanghai, he was promoted to an important position and, becoming successful at a young age, fell into bad company and became obsessed with pleasure. She repeatedly advised him, but Zhang did not heed her advice and turned against her, calling her a "country bumpkin," thus sowing his own bitter fruit. Zhang can be said to have been a victim of Shanghai's wicked environment. As for his acquaintance with Ms. Hui, it was through an introduction at a banquet. Later, on the girl's birthday, he came to the east to invite her out, and their relationship became closer and closer. They often drove together to Hongqiao on weekends. However, Wang's father did not approve of Zhang, and Zhang, being extremely competitive, was determined to win Wang over. He signed divorce papers with his wife, but was arrested three days later. Zhang's last words were: "Life is like a dream, and my dream was too short." Yesterday, Zhang's wife said: "My dream is too bitter and desolate." After she published the notice addressed to Ms. Dang, she only received a phone call from someone related to both parties, who disapproved of her actions and thought they were intended to incite jealousy. She vehemently denied this intention yesterday. Her residence was originally the property of the traitor Zhou Bangjun and is now being reclaimed by the authorities. She will find another house to move to and plans to find a job to support Zhang's mother and sister. Yesterday, a reporter also visited Ms. Wang, but was unable to meet her. Her father, Wang Zhunchen, spoke instead, saying that his daughter was only eighteen years old and a "child" who did not understand love at all. Because she has always had a talent and love for music, she often performs on stage as a guest, so she has more contact with the outside world, but her relationship with Zhang Yamin was only ordinary friendship, and the various rumors are not worth taking seriously. She has decided to ignore Zhang's wife's advertisement.</p>
<p>[Another report] While Zhang was in prison, he wrote many poems on draft paper. His wife showed them to me yesterday. Here are some of them: "In the lonely and sorrowful prison, I only suffer from homesickness. Gazing at the white clouds, I dream and weep on my lonely pillow." "A brave man enters prison, fearing the sunrise in the morning. So many sad things happen that my soul is startled at night." "Qu Yuan threw himself into the river, General Yue Fei died on trumped-up charges. Loyal ministers only have the will to serve the country, brave men regret having no heart to kill traitors." "I want to send my sorrows on a jade letter, but alas, the green crow warns me back. It seems that tonight is the most sorrowful, all my thoughts are for the full moon." "Meritorious achievements are no longer in my mind, I only hope for prison food day and night. With a seven-foot body to support my family and serve the country, I will return to the mountains to cut firewood with the woodcutters in the spring."</p>
<h3>Hua Xing Shen Zhuang Exchange Rate Arbitrage Case: Xu and His Son Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Xu Ke, manager of Hua Xing Shen Zhuang, was accused of private foreign exchange arbitrage. The Special Criminal Court has recently filed a public prosecution in the case. Xu is from Fujian, 52 years old. According to the indictment, Xu and his son Xu Bochao (the person in charge of Hua Xing Shen Zhuang's Hong Kong office) are engaged in the business of transporting books, stationery, cotton fabrics, etc., and selling them in Siam, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia. They usually do not handle the foreign exchange earned through their business in accordance with the statutory procedures managed by the Central Bank, but instead privately hand it over to Hong Kong to operate in the black market for foreign exchange, which is remitted through the Dao Heng and Guang An Banks. Xu also bought and sold black market gold at Xu Bochao's request in December of last year, profiting from it. On August 23 of this year, Xu Bochao again purchased black market Hong Kong currency worth 5 billion legal tender and remitted it to Shanghai. On August 29 of the same year, he sent a receipt for payment from Huatong Company, informing Xu and the store's accountant, Hu Defu, to receive it. After someone reported it to the office of the supervisory inspector, the Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to investigate and seize seven gold ingots weighing seven taels and seven qian. Xu was arrested and, after being transferred to the Special Criminal Court for investigation, was prosecuted according to law. His son Xu Bochao is at large and is also being prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Land Administration Bureau Technician Sued for Transferring Rental Property Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yu Guangzu, a technician at the Municipal Land Administration Bureau from Nantong, falsely claimed in March of this year that he was transferring his rental property at 138 Zhaofeng Villa and asked Si Zhongshi, a tenant downstairs, to introduce him to a buyer. On June 22 of the same year, Si introduced Chen Daoyi, an agent for the Free Forum newspaper in this city, who agreed to the transfer. The two parties agreed on a transfer fee of 5.338 billion yuan, with half to be paid in advance, and five keys to the house were handed over to Si to be passed on. The remaining payment was to be paid after the house was cleared out. Unexpectedly, Yu suddenly asked Si to return the keys. Si refused because he was the intermediary and did not want to break his promise. Yu then took the same keys he had in reserve, opened the door, and had his relatives move in, denying that he had transferred the property. Chen believed that Yu's actions were suspected of fraudulently obtaining the transfer fee and filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office. After investigation, the office has now filed a public prosecution against Yu on charges of fraud.</p>
<h3>Gold Yuan Not Circulating in Taiwan; Travelers Limited to Carrying 50 Yuan</h3>

Travelers carrying Gold Yuan to other ports in the country from Taiwan, or carrying Gold Yuan to Taiwan from other ports in the country, should be limited to 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mayor Sends Letters to Foreign Companies, Asking for Donations to Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The solicitation of special relief donations in this city has reached its final stage. Mayor Wu recently sent letters to various foreign companies, asking them to donate 2% of the amount of foreign exchange they obtained at official prices, in accordance with the central government's regulations. It is reported that in addition to sending letters to foreign companies, the mayor also asked various importers to donate in the same proportion. Once this batch of donations is collected, the special relief donation work in this city can be concluded.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of Advertising Association Directors and Supervisors</h3>

<h3>Increased Tax on Goods Allowed to Increase in Price; Rising Prices in Outlying Areas; Effective Action Immediately Taken to Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The second meeting of the Shanghai District Price Review Committee was held yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Those present included Jiang Jingguo, Mayor Wu, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, Xu Jiguang, Zhao Zengjue, Wu Yun Chu, Shui Xiangyun, and others, chaired by Yu Hongjun. First, the heads of the various competent authorities reported on the situation of price control. Subsequently, several important cases were passed. Regarding the question of whether the prices in this city should be appropriately adjusted, it was resolved that, in addition to the various goods on which the Ministry of Finance recently decided to increase taxes, which may be adjusted by adding the amount of the new tax to the selling price compared to the tax amount in August in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the remaining various daily necessities should still comply with the price limits, strictly control them, and strictly prohibit price increases. The committee also paid special attention to the rising prices in the outlying areas of Shanghai and decided that the supervisory office should immediately take effective action to suppress them.</p>
<p>Types of Goods with Increased Taxes</p>
<p>[Another report] The goods with adjusted commodity taxes are limited to cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco, native tobacco, native tobacco silk, foreign wine, beer, native wine, tin foil, and superstitious paper. The originally planned tax increases on matches, sugar, cotton yarn, cement, and fur have now been decided not to be implemented. All the goods with increased taxes are not daily necessities, so the tax increase will not affect the prices of daily necessities.</p>
<h3>Land Produce Dealers Manipulating Vegetables; Supply in Urban Areas Abnormal; Wholesale Prices Including Basket Weight for Many Varieties Exceeding Price Limits</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A reporter recently spent several days visiting rural villages and markets in the suburbs of Shanghai, including Wusong, Jiangwan, Pudong, Zhenru, Longhua, Fahua, Xujiahui, and other places, and found that the abnormality in the supply of vegetables in the urban area recently is not due to a decrease in the production of vegetables in the surrounding areas, but is due to the fact that there are countless "land produce dealers" (commonly known as vegetable shops) in the suburbs, acting as intermediaries between producers and consumers, who have not been able to comply with the laws and regulations, causing the urban area's vegetable market to be chaotic, price limits cannot be maintained, and supply relations cannot be normalized.</p>
<p>The area of land planted with vegetables around the suburbs of Shanghai is estimated to be at least 30,000 mu. The vegetables grown, including various crops, are uninterrupted from spring to winter. In addition, farmers value land and often adopt intensive planting methods, such as planting onions under the loofah vine trellis, and planting chives in the gaps between potato fields. In terms of the output obtained from this kind of cultivation, it should not be lacking to supply the non-staple food for a population of 5 million. Currently, anyone can drive to the suburbs to inspect. In places farther from the highway, the vegetable fields are endless, with edamame, spinach, onions, and chive sprouts fluttering in the wind, plump and lovely.</p>
<p>Controlling the Real Power of Adjustment</p>
<p>These vegetables must go through two stages from the farmer to the consumer: first, the "land produce dealers" purchase from the farmers every day, and then the vegetable vendors wholesale from them and transport them to the urban area to resell to vegetable stalls. Generally speaking, the "land produce dealers" have a closer relationship with the producers, and the vegetable vendors have a deeper relationship with the consumers, but the "land produce dealers" still control the real power to adjust the quantity and the price. A "land produce dealer" is scattered in every town and village in the suburbs. Larger towns have more than 30 of them. Their organization is extremely simple, with only a mat shed, a table, a scale, and three or four employees. The vegetable vendors are mostly refugees from other provinces who have fled to Shanghai. There are currently more than 10,000 people engaged in this profession in the city. Most of them rely on carrying vegetables on their shoulders and walking from the suburbs to the city.</p>
<p>Wholesaling at Double the Price</p>
<p>After the "land produce dealers" obtain vegetables from the farmers at low prices every day, they often wholesale them to the vegetable vendors at double the price, plus commission. They not only do not sell at the regulated wholesale price, but also try to include the weight of the basket when weighing the vegetables, so the actual wholesale price of various vegetables is equal to or higher than the price limits in the urban area. In order to seek appropriate profits, vegetable vendors cannot but increase the selling price. When stall vendors then supply them to the black market at even higher prices, they conceal and evade each other. Vegetables sold at the price limits are, of course, nowhere to be found in the market, and it is even more impossible to talk about a normal supply relationship. According to the vegetable vendors, although they know that selling vegetables above the price limits in the urban area is illegal, they should not be held responsible.</p>
<p>Wholesale Prices of Main Vegetables</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation in various places, the actual wholesale price of major vegetables per catty in the suburbs (including commission and basket weight) is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Should Be Strengthened Control</p>
<p>The only place in the suburbs with a relatively better situation is the Pudong district, where the "land produce dealers" are supervised from time to time by plainclothes control personnel, so the wholesale prices are more ideal, and bad habits such as including the weight of the basket are also rare. For example, edamame is wholesaled at only 5.5 cents per catty, and hairy vegetables are also wholesaled at only 5 cents. These vegetables can be sold in the market without exceeding the price limits. However, due to the inconvenience of water and land transportation and the exorbitant freight costs, vegetable vendors mostly choose to wholesale from places such as Zhenru and Jiangwan. As a result, vegetables sold at the price limits have become constantly absent from the vegetable markets in the urban area.</p>
<p>Currently, if we want to get to the root of the problem and restore the normal supply of vegetables, so that every stall vendor can abide by the price limits, it seems necessary to strengthen control over the nearly 1,000 "land produce dealers" in the suburbs and lower the wholesale prices.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of the "student spies," in which 86 college and middle school students were arrested, has been concluded by the Special Criminal Court.

<h3>Male Corpse Found on Song Park Road</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at around 2 p.m., a villager found an unidentified male corpse in a field on the side of Zhongshan Road, Song Park Road, Zhabei. He was about 24 or 25 years old, naked on the upper body, with his hands tied behind his back. A rope was around his head and neck. He was wearing a poplin western-style pant on the lower body, grass-green socks with turned-down cuffs, without shoes. His hair was short and sparse, and his body was strong. The Dachang Police Sub-bureau immediately sent police officers to investigate after receiving the report and reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which sent the photography division to take photos in the countryside. The name of the deceased and the cause of death are currently being thoroughly investigated by the Dachang Sub-bureau.</p>
<h3>Automobile Gasoline Conservation; Detailed Rules Amended and Approved; Regulations on Reduction Standards; Detailed Tables Listed; Objections May Be Reconsidered with Explanation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Automobile Gasoline Conservation Method, after the Conservation Review Committee submitted three plans to the Executive Yuan for review, and then formulated interim measures in accordance with the third plan, will be implemented on October 1. Yesterday morning, the committee convened another meeting to discuss the detailed rules for the implementation of the interim measures, which was chaired by Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen. The draft of the detailed rules for implementation was amended and approved, and after Mayor Wu makes the final decision, it can be officially announced and implemented tomorrow. It is reported that the draft stipulates that, in addition to vehicles that meet the regulations of the Executive Yuan, gasoline rationing should not be reduced. The rest will be rationed according to the basic amount. Detailed tables are listed for which automobiles of organizations, legal entities, and individuals should have their gasoline ration reduced by one-fourth, which should have their ration reduced by one-half, what kind of identity is allowed to have a fixed amount of gasoline, and what kind of identity can only be allocated the basic amount of gasoline. If each household believes that it is inappropriate, they can submit a written explanation to the meeting for reconsideration. The deadline is the end of this month. Overdue applications will not be reviewed. As for the transfer of ownership, when a group or individual that meets the central government's regulations requests a transfer of ownership, it must be reviewed and confirmed that the transfer is necessary before it can be approved. However, those who originally had the basic gasoline ration will still be given the basic amount and will not be changed to avoid malpractice.</p>

<h3>Truck Hit by Train West of Zhenru Station; Driver and Escort Both Killed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning at around 9 a.m., a train and a truck collided in Zhenru, a suburb of the city. The truck driver and escort were both killed. The truck was destroyed. After the accident, in addition to the owner handling the aftermath, the Railway Bureau is also investigating the issue of responsibility. An Anle Cotton Mill truck with license plate number 03-7827 was transporting nitric acid from the United Chemical Materials Factory in the early morning to a factory near Zhaofeng Park.

<h3>Public School Staff: Allocation of Surplus Supplies; Beijing and Shanghai to Begin Pilot Program; Point System to be Adopted</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Bureau of Materials Supply recently decided to sell surplus materials to public school staff and has scheduled a pilot program to begin this month in Beijing and Shanghai.

<h3>Implement Economic Controls; Stabilize People's Livelihoods; Chiang Ching-kuo's Letter to a Friend</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Chiang Ching-kuo recently sent a letter to his friend Liu Hanqing, the Director of Finance of Guizhou Province, reviewing the results of economic management in Shanghai and again strongly emphasizing his determination to crack down on speculators. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Hanqing: Your letter has been received long ago. I have been busy lately, so I am only writing back today. Please forgive me. Since the victory, for the past three years, all the people in the country have hoped to live a stable life and for the country and society to move onto a normal path. To achieve this goal, we must not only overcome all political and military difficulties, but also make the same efforts in the economic field, in order to eliminate the speculation, hoarding, and all abnormal economic behavior that cause economic chaos. Therefore, on August 19, the government resolutely implemented the decision of economic controls and currency reform. This is a correct policy to save the country and the people.</p>
<p>Protect Legitimate Businesses; Eliminate All Excessive Profits</p>
<p>I was ordered to come to Shanghai to assist Mr. Yu Hongjun in supervising currency reform and economic controls. The responsibility is heavy. Its success or failure is related to the survival of the entire country and nation. Therefore, in order to accomplish the task, I have to adopt a strict and resolute attitude. Therefore, no matter who violates government laws and regulations, they will be severely punished according to law. Any illegal behavior will be cracked down on. What we are cracking down on is not the legitimate profits of industry and commerce, but excessive profits. What we oppose are those speculators and their behavior who make fortunes from national crises. We have repeatedly stated that we absolutely protect private property and legitimate industry and commerce. Only policies that seek the interests of the people can win the support of the people. Taking the interests of the majority of the people as our own interests and protecting legitimate industry and commerce are two sides of the same coin, inseparable from each other. In the past forty-two days of work, we are very grateful to the people of Shanghai for giving us a lot of help and encouragement. Therefore, we were able to achieve initial success.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange-Related Commodities; Will Be Adjusted Reasonably</p>
<p>I can assure you that the speculative market in Shanghai has been eliminated, and bank deposits have increased dozens of times compared to before the currency reform. Bank interest rates have been reduced to four or five points. This is only the first step towards a normal economic life. What I mean by a normal economic life is normal transactions, open buying and selling, so that industry and commerce can obtain legitimate profits, and the people will not suffer from high prices and can live a stable life. The work of the past forty-odd days can only be said to have laid a preliminary foundation for a stable economic life. We do not believe that the power of the police can solve economic problems, but no one can deny that in the current situation, political power is one of the main conditions for solving economic chaos. The methods are nothing more than: strictly implementing controls on the one hand, and planning how to stabilize Shanghai's economy on the other. What everyone is concerned about now is industrial raw materials. According to reliable surveys, most raw materials, except for a few, can last for at least three months. Regarding the supply of raw materials, the government has decided that industry associations and government agencies will jointly purchase them from various places. As for raw materials purchased abroad with self-provided foreign exchange, it has also been decided to open them up. After August 19, the exchange rate has been increased, so the selling price of imported goods has also increased accordingly. We have considered that we will make reasonable adjustments to commodities related to foreign exchange, so that raw materials can be supplied continuously without fear of shortage.</p>
<p>Shanghai Prices Are Lower; Determined to Bring Other Places Up to Par</p>
<p>Now, the prices in Shanghai are lower compared to other places, so distributors from all over are flocking to Shanghai to purchase goods. The reason why this phenomenon occurs is that controls in other places are not strict, and some goods in Shanghai have been frozen and cannot flow smoothly. Regarding this issue, the government has decided to implement comprehensive controls, and will place the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the city of Nanjing under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Supervision Zone. In the future, we will decide to bring the prices in other places up to par with Shanghai. Shanghai is the industrial center of our country, with a large output. If it is not allowed to export, it will inevitably affect the entire production. Therefore, we have decided to carry out planned sales in order to ensure the smooth flow of goods.</p>
<p>Guide Floating Capital into Production; Bring Life Back on Track</p>
<p>Floating capital has become a serious problem in Shanghai. If it is not properly channeled, it will inevitably lead to speculation and hoarding. At present, in addition to selling surplus materials, state-owned enterprise stocks, short-term treasury bills, and enemy and puppet assets to absorb floating capital, the most important thing is how to guide it into productive enterprises. In order to achieve this goal, the first thing is to stabilize prices. At present, there are still two incorrect concepts: First, some people in the business community have been accustomed to using speculation and high prices to get rich in recent years, instead of being satisfied with obtaining legitimate profits, thinking that they cannot survive without engaging in national accumulation or rising prices. This improper concept must be eliminated. We hope that people engaged in industry and commerce will be law-abiding, strive for economic stability, and seek legitimate profits. Second, the rich people in Shanghai have always been accustomed to a comfortable life. One day, if they cannot buy meat, chicken, or eggs, or wool or yarn, they think it is terrible. We must know that we are currently in a difficult period and must bring economic life back on track so that the market can be stable. In this way, we can live a stable life. We will never retreat or even abandon the established control policies because of the current shortage of certain commodities.</p>
<p>Endure Temporary Pain; Solve All Kinds of Difficulties</p>
<p>In the past month, we have received so many threats, forcing us to compromise on price limits. Meat merchants have requested price increases eight times, but we would rather not buy meat than let them raise prices. In addition, there are some small factories that have suspended production due to lack of raw materials. We are working on a way to solve the raw material problem for them in the near future so that they can resume production. We are not afraid of difficulties, but if there are difficulties, we will always try our best to overcome them and never waver in the established decisions. Similar situations may occur in the near future, and are inevitable. In order to accomplish the task of economic control, we must endure temporary pain, but temporary pain is always much lighter than enduring long-term inflation. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai can share the difficulties and overcome the current difficulties, and maintain the basis of price stability that we have already achieved, and not be destroyed by unscrupulous merchants. Otherwise, Shanghai will once again become the world of speculators and hoarders, and at that time, all the citizens of Shanghai will once again fall into the terror of life.</p>
<p>Absolutely Maintain Price Limits; Intensify the Crackdown on Unscrupulous Merchants</p>
<p>In October, the government decided to allocate food rice to citizens, and public affairs vegetables will still be supplied to citizens at the September prices. Other prices will also not be changed. In short, except for a few commodities related to foreign exchange and tax increases that will be reasonably adjusted, all other commodities will maintain the "August 19" price limits, and even those that are too high will be suppressed, so that the entire industry and commerce can move towards normalization, but no one will be allowed to take the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market. Cracking down on unscrupulous merchants is one of the targets of our work and will never be relaxed. There are mutual rights and obligations between the government and the people. The obligation of the people to the government is to strengthen the power of the government. The government also has the responsibility to ensure the livelihood of the people. The difficulties of the government should be announced to the people, and the pain of the people should also be brought to the government. Everyone should recognize that today's situation is extremely difficult, but we should have a calm attitude and courage to overcome it, so that we can obtain a stable life. Wishing you good health!

<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: Western Section Terminus; Zhuzhou on the Edge of Hunan Province</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Report from Nanchang, 25th] Zhuzhou, the terminus of the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, now bears the brunt of the transportation hub between Southeast and Southwest China. Tianxin, five kilometers north of the Zhuzhou Station on the Guangdong-Han Railway, will be the joint station of the Guangdong-Han, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and the Xiang-Qian Railway, which is waiting to be built.</p>
<p>The minerals, especially coal and iron, stored in Hunan Province are important raw materials for heavy industry in the future, and Zhuzhou is the center of convenient transportation. Therefore, many heavy industries, such as agricultural chemical plants, ×× ordnance factories, etc., are moving to Zhuzhou to build factories.</p>
<p>The central government has already decided on part of the construction plan for the new Zhuzhou, such as the preparation and construction of the Tianxin Joint Station, which is a transportation sector in the entire construction plan. The future of Zhuzhou is bright and great.</p>
<p>The current stage of Zhuzhou is still wearing the cloak of a town. The first time I stepped into the edge of Hunan, Zhuzhou, I saw the large plates of betel nuts that Hunan people like to eat, which made me recall the tragic scene when General Xue Boliang passed through Zhuzhou during the three victories in Changsha. Now it has returned to its pre-war state. There are banks, transportation companies, and endless trains and sailboats here.</p>
<p>This time, I returned from Zhuzhou and got off the train in Pingxiang in the middle of the night. The night in Pingxiang is a journey that I will never forget. There is a hotel called "Ping Zong" in the city, but because it was late at night and quiet, I couldn't find it anywhere. I had to find "Jiaotong" on the wet and dirty street leading into the city to stay. This small inn had gambling, prostitution, and countless bugs and mosquitoes. I went to bed and resisted the "evil forces," looking forward to dawn. Unexpectedly, around two o'clock, a strong man of unknown identity rushed into the door and grabbed me fiercely, asking, "What are you doing? Why are you staying in my room?"... At that time, I was also inexplicably why this happened. Later, an old woman came to explain that he had originally booked this room for accommodation because he was drunk and asked me to forgive him.</p>
<p>I inquired about who this fierce man was, and then I learned that he was a "wounded soldier" from the Veterans Hospital. It was really "a scholar meeting a soldier, there is no reasoning to be done." I had to let him scold me.</p>
<p>Yichun preserved eggs are a specialty of the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. In the past, they were cheap and of good quality. When we went to Zhuzhou, we heard that they sold for 50,000 yuan each. This time, when we came back, we specially inquired in Zhuzhou, preparing to buy some to nourish the children, but unexpectedly, in the three days that had passed, the price had increased by more than double, and the asking price was 120,000, and the egg shop was unwilling to sell much. Ham was also regarded as a precious guest and could not be bought. It is said that from Zhuzhou to Xinyu, before the issuance of gold coupons, the silver dollars here were only 4 million each, but now they have risen to 6 million. All prices have been raised by three points in "compliance with the law." Up to now, I have not seen a single price control announcement from the county government. Most of the rice and other transactions in various places still use silver dollars. The gold coupons have a good influence on the people, but the local banks have not yet started to exchange them.</p>
<p>A piece of armed fighting battlefield. The weapons held by the people include rifles, pistols, grenades, and mortars and artillery. During armed fighting, both sides plant flags and form formations, and build field fortifications, as if facing a great enemy. Last year, the armed fighting in Fenyi lasted for three or four months, and the number of people participating in the battle involved four or five counties. I won't talk about the votes. Sometimes, the county magistrate came forward to stop it, and they would entertain him very politely, but they would also temporarily borrow the county magistrate's currency to suppress the weapons of the artillery, fight a fierce battle, and then return the original items. The wage for ordinary people to go to the Currency Martial Arts to participate in one side of the battle is five yuan in silver, and half price without a gun—two yuan and five cents.</p>
<p>The transportation from Suzhou to Nanchang can also be said to be the full line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, because all the signs for the Zhangshu Bridge are still in Canada, and the departure has been postponed again and again, so it affects the transportation of the entire line. The Railway Bureau originally planned to build a wooden pontoon bridge before the difficult problem of the Zhangshu Bridge was resolved, but the Ministry of Communications believed that the steel beams could be shipped in June, so it rejected the request. Later, the Railway Bureau saw that the solution to the problem was not easy, so it used ferries to transport the urgently needed machines and cars from the western section to the other side of the river upstream of the bridge, and set up a station in Menlouli. In the future, passenger transport is prepared to exchange rides with the military in Menlouli and the east bank of Zhangshu, using ferries to transport passengers across the river, but freight cars are transported by barges. This time-consuming and laborious method takes two to two hours each time it crosses the river, even if the wind is calm and the waves are calm. If there is a flood, it will probably take more time. Facing this difficulty, the Railway Bureau has now decided to build a pontoon bridge downstream of the Zhangshu Bridge. The inspection team that went west this time also went to Zhangshu to survey, and Yan Tiesheng, deputy chief engineer, was left in Zhangshu to find a solution. It is reported that the location of the pontoon bridge has been determined to be downstream of the Gan River, with a total length of 800 meters, and about 5 kilometers of earthwork will need to be added, and another track will be laid. The total project cost is estimated to be around 20 billion yuan, and it can be completed in three months. However, they are still looking forward to the arrival of the steel beams, otherwise, the pontoon bridge will have problems after the river rises next spring, so the smooth flow of the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will have to wait for two or three months.</p>
<h3>Several Problems in the Nanzhou Section Still Need to Be Resolved</h3>
<p>The difficult problems after the opening of the Nanzhou section still need to be solved. The following are just a few things that the reporter saw and heard along the line this time.</p>
<p>The steel goods problem. The salvage work of the Zhangshu Bridge and the branches of the Gan River has been completed 50%, and the construction of the bridge piers has also been completed, waiting for the Canadian steel beams to be put on the shelves. However, it has been heard for half a year that this batch of steel goods will soon be shipped from Canada, so at that time, the Railway Bureau planned to build a pontoon bridge in Zhangshu in preparation for opening to traffic. The Ministry of Communications trusted that the steel beams could be delivered on schedule and rejected the Railway Bureau's plan. Then, it started to set up a ferry in Zhangshu to send carriages across the river, so now the line on the west bank of Jiangxi has been changed to Menlouli, and the urgently needed nail road materials and some carriages are transported by ferry. However, the facts tell them that each ferry takes one and a half hours from the east bank to Menlouli, plus getting on the boat on the east bank and climbing the slope on the west bank, it also takes two hours even if the wind is calm and the waves are calm. In the future, the freight transport, under the current circumstances, must move the entire carriage from this bank to the other. Although passenger transport has prepared two trains to meet each other on both banks, passengers will not be able to bear it when they encounter a cold winter and snow, or a sunny day. Not only will the passengers not sympathize with the Railway Bureau's difficulties, but also the order during the crossing will probably become a big problem. Moreover, when military transport is busy, it will be even more difficult for the employees at the station to cope with.</p>
<p>Friends from the eastern section of "Zhejiang" all say that the "red hats" on this road are very well-organized in serving passengers. However, from Yingtan West, in Nanchang's Niuhang, Jiujiang, Pingxiang, and even Zhuzhou, the Railway Bureau cannot manage them because of the local labor. For example: the evil forces can arbitrarily collect loading and unloading fees from passengers. Nanchang Niuhang and Jiujiang are controlled by the local people. In the past, the loading fee for a car in Xiaogang Port was only more than 30 million according to the regulations of the Railway Bureau, but the local porters demanded 300 million. The same incident also occurred in Zhuzhou. The loading and unloading work is directly related to the passengers. If they do not understand the inside story, they will of course complain about the Railway Bureau's mismanagement, but the fact is that there are internal difficulties.</p>
<p>The impact of armed fighting</p>
<p>The old people in the section from Xinyi west to Yichun east of the Nanzhou section are known for their armed fighting. The weapons stored in the countryside include not only long guns and short guns, but also mortars and artillery. During their armed fighting, the wages of the fighters are five yuan in silver for those with guns and two yuan and five cents in silver for those without guns. If they are killed in battle, there is also a generous resettlement fee. The abundant local weapons affect the local security, and armed fighting and even robbery often occur. Now, the theft of railway materials is constantly happening in Zhangshu, and the theft of road nails and fish scale plates is also happening in Xinyi from time to time. These incidents may directly or indirectly affect the future driving.</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau is now trying to solve some of the above-mentioned difficulties, and at the same time, they hope that the local people will give them sympathetic assistance.</p>
<h3>Restricting the Import and Export of Gold Coupons; Hong Kong Begins Strict Enforcement</h3>
<p>Over-limit Funds Will Be Confiscated</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hong Kong 30th Telegram] Since the currency change, the regulations on the import and export of gold coupons stipulate a limit of twenty yuan. Starting from the 22nd of this month, the anti-smuggling office of the Hong Kong Customs and the police officers at the pier and station have begun to carry out strict inspections. On the morning of the 28th, two passengers who violated the regulations by carrying gold coupons exceeding the import and export limit were seized at Kai Tak Airport and sentenced in the Kowloon Court. (1) Zhang Gongrui, a 38-year-old Shanghai businessman, came to Hong Kong on a China Airlines flight from Shanghai. When he arrived at Kai Tak Airport, anti-smuggling officers found 160 yuan of gold coupons in the defendant's luggage. After the trial, it was ordered that the excess of 160 yuan of gold coupons be confiscated. (2) Huang Peisi, a 48-year-old comprador of the Taikoo Shipping Company, was searched by anti-smuggling officer No. 362 at 11:00 a.m. on the 27th before leaving Hong Kong on a Hong Kong Airlines flight, and 287.60 yuan of gold coupons were found on him. The court ruled that the guarantee of 50 yuan in cash and the gold coupons found were confiscated.</p>
<h3>The City of Kweiting in Kweichow Flourishes from American Tobacco, Heading Towards Normal Development</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter, Liu Meng-Chi</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Kweiyang, 27th of this month] Kweiting, Kweichow Province's American tobacco, now as famous as Nanyang's Nangcheng Xuchang in Henan and Jianyang Ziyang in Sichuan, has long been valued by tobacco businesses. Since the advocacy of former provincial chairman Yang Sen and the current emphasis on increased production by Gu Zhenglun, this once impoverished and obscure small county has seen the establishment of numerous national banks, bureaus, and commercial firms. The people are well-fed and clothed, and their living standards have improved. This has not only influenced other counties in the province to try planting, but has also attracted American tobacco industry professionals to come to Kweichow for observation and learning, causing a widespread sensation. Consequently, the local cigarette industry has been rapidly developing, and the national tax revenue has also greatly increased. All levels of government and the people place the greatest hope on American tobacco production. Therefore, before the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), Kweichow's specialty was Huangcaoba's opium, but after the 30th year, Kweiting's American tobacco has become the most outstanding. According to Fang Zhaoheng, manager of the Kweichow Tobacco Company, the production statistics for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) show that the total harvest in the province was about 80,000 "dan" (a unit of weight), and Kweiting alone accounted for more than 60,000 "dan." With the current market price of over 200 million yuan in legal tender for every 100 "jin" (another unit of weight) of top-quality yellow leaves, the total figure is astonishing! As a reporter who visited Kweiting at the beginning of summer this year when American tobacco was being planted, I know that the county is indeed a small city with an area of only 1,909.60 square kilometers, or 7,638.40 square "shi li" (a traditional Chinese unit of distance). It has 2,864.40 "shi mu" (a traditional Chinese unit of area) of arable land, and a current population of 105,405 people, averaging about 54 people per square kilometer. However, due to the suitable climate and moderate rainfall, it is extremely suitable for agricultural production. The Xiang-Qian and Qian-Gui highways both run through the county, and military transports often use the county seat as a stopover. The Duzhu section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian railway, which is under construction, also passes through the county along the Qian-Gui highway from west to east. The future railway station will be located at Taohuaping, north of the city. Various major towns in the county and neighboring counties are connected by highways, which is quite convenient for tobacco farmers and merchants to travel and for the collection and distribution of tobacco leaves. The streets in the city are flat, and factories and stores are everywhere. There are opera houses and cinemas. The clothing of the people is generally more fashionable than in the provincial capital, Guiyang. They are particularly fond of gambling and prostitution. Large denomination banknotes circulate in the market earlier than in Guiyang, mostly brought by national banks or tobacco merchants from Beijing and Shanghai. Therefore, the cost of living is particularly high. Those who pass through the area cannot help but recognize this as an abnormally developed rural prosperity.</p>
<p>Since the mid-Qing Dynasty, the county has been known for producing leaf tobacco, which is sold throughout the province and parts of Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan. The raw material used is the locally produced "zhe" tobacco, which is milder in taste than other tobacco leaves in the province and "jintangshi" tobacco in Sichuan. Its seeds came from Fujian Province, and the production area spans about two to three hundred "li" (another traditional Chinese unit of distance). As for American tobacco, it was brought from the United States in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940) by Peng Hu, the general manager of the Guizhou Enterprise Company. The Guizhou Tobacco Company and the Guizhou Agricultural Improvement Institute established a cooperative method for promoting American tobacco. The Agricultural Improvement Institute sent personnel to provide guidance, and agreed to distribute seeds to farmers who had previously planted "zhe" tobacco, teaching them methods of sowing, seedling cultivation, transplanting, and fertilization, and encouraging them to plant. However, the planting suffered a setback due to hail that year, resulting in very little production. But the tobacco leaves obtained were tested by the company and found to be excellent in color and aroma, quite different from other products of the same kind. Tobacco farmers also felt that planting American tobacco on the same amount of land yielded more than planting "zhe" tobacco. The Tobacco Company, in order to encourage promotion, did not hesitate to purchase at high prices. As a result of the publicity, those who planted American tobacco emerged one after another. Since then, year after year, efforts have been made to improve it, and American tobacco in Kweiting has spread like wildfire, with a sharp increase in production. Today, the fields of the county are a sea of green, having become a world of American tobacco.</p>
<p>High-quality American tobacco leaves are characterized by being wide, uniform, and thin, with dense veins, no blisters or scars, a golden color, not oily or sticky, not dry, and a clear aroma. Although this is related to planting, fertilization, baking, and fermentation, the climate and soil still play an important role. Kweiting has mostly sandy loam soil and a mild climate, so it is suitable for planting American tobacco. However, the leaves produced are also divided into "inner mountain" and "outer mountain." "Inner mountain" refers to the tobacco produced in the hinterland of the county, around two hundred square kilometers, and its tobacco leaves are not significantly different from the original variety. The output of "outer mountain" is slightly inferior, but it is still superior to that produced in other counties. Those familiar with the tobacco business can tell it at a glance. There is an absolutely unmistakable difference between "inner mountain" and "outer mountain" tobacco leaves: at the point where the petiole separates from the stem, the leaves of "outer mountain" and outer counties always have a small number of stem skin and vein tendons, and the petiole ends are pointed after drying. The petiole ends of "inner mountain" tobacco leaves are neat at the cut, without reverse tendons, and the petiole ends swell and become round like "nails" after baking. This kind of "inner mountain" tobacco leaves, even in the Kweiting market, often fetch higher prices per hundred "jin" than other tobacco leaves, and tobacco factories mostly use it as raw material for high-end cigarettes. Tobacco farmers have accumulated eight or nine years of practical experience in planting, transplanting, and baking American tobacco. They not only have sufficient knowledge of tobacco leaf growth technology, but also know how to select the right climate and soil. Farmers pay special attention to the "baking" technique, but equipment is not easy to obtain, and controlling the heat is particularly difficult, but there are about 8,000 tobacco farmers with baking rooms in the county. Since the promotion of planting in the Kweiting American tobacco area by the Guizhou Tobacco Company in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), production has increased sharply.</p>
<p>The cigarette industry has also emerged in response. In the beginning, apart from the Guizhou Tobacco Company, there were no large-scale organizations. Even those that existed were only civilians who had fled from the occupied areas or veterans recuperating from injuries, using wooden hand-cranked cigarette machines to retail cigarettes in the streets and alleys. Therefore, the American tobacco produced in Kweiting in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) was still purchased by the Guizhou Tobacco Company at high prices. In the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd years (1942-1944), the number of tobacco farmers increased sharply, and production increased. Between the 34th, 35th, and 36th years (1945-1947), the government spared no effort in guiding the improvement of quality and baking technology, and at the same time provided as much assistance as possible to tobacco farmers, organizing cooperative loans. As a result, production became even more abundant. Baking rooms were built, and nurseries were established on their own. Within the county seat, the Jiuda Cigarette Factory and others were established one after another, and at the same time, they were sold to the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. Later, the Guilin No. 1 Middle School Cigarette Factory and the Guilin Cigarette Cooperative moved to Kweiting and established factories in Guiyang to manufacture various brands of cigarettes in large quantities. At that time, because Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and the滇缅路 (Burma Road) were blocked and foreign goods could not be imported, factories evolved together, and the quality and packaging were greatly improved, so hand-rolled cigarettes were gradually eliminated. Around the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, the cigarette factories in Kweiting and Guiyang strengthened their efforts to seize the market in other provinces, and greatly increased the production and sales to Sichuan, Yunnan, and the southwestern and northwestern provinces. For example, the Golden Eagle and Penguin cigarettes produced by the Guizhou Tobacco Company were once transported from Kunming to India and Burma, and were welcomed everywhere for their excellent quality and low price. Because of this, those who engaged in the American tobacco business in major cities in the country gathered in Kweiting. At present, in addition to tobacco merchants from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wuhan, Guilin, Liuzhou, Changsha, Hengyang, and Chongqing who have established large-scale firms in the county seat, Kweiting tobacco merchants have also established firms and warehouses in Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Hunan, and Chongqing. Each year, about 5,000 vehicles of tobacco leaves are packaged and transported from here. There are also large cigarette factories in the city such as China, Jincheng, Yiji, Xiangnan, Times, Decheng, Qihua, Jingsheng, Qianghua, Samsung, and Juhua Xiang, which produce excellent and abundant products, with inventories piled up like mountains. It is no exaggeration to call it "the city of cigarettes."</p>
<p>However, American tobacco leaves are prone to deterioration during sowing and transplantation, and tobacco farmers in Kweiting are eager for immediate gains and do not know how to preserve the original variety unchanged, which is like killing the hen to get the eggs. At the time of sowing in early summer this year, continuous rain affected the seedbeds, and less than half of the seedlings survived. After the Dragon Boat Festival, when the tobacco seedlings were growing, they were destroyed by wind and rain, and the survivors were short and had sparse leaves. According to the observations and estimates of experienced people, if the weather does not continue to clear up, this year's American tobacco in Kweiting and nearby counties can be expected to yield 300 "jin" for every 10,000 plants, and it may be difficult to bake. Measuring the annual losses of tobacco farmers by this income, the golden leaf dream this year may not be as good as in previous years. In view of this, the provincial government recently ordered the provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute to select agricultural personnel with experience in American tobacco planting from the tobacco-producing counties to come to Guiyang for study. After graduating from the six-month American Tobacco Baking Technology Training Class, it recently held a one-year American Tobacco Planting Technology Training Class. At the same time, it instructed the Guizhou Tobacco Company to quickly organize demonstration work such as grading, packaging, and baking, so that this emerging rural sideline industry can follow a normal development path. Regarding the export of American tobacco, the province has found that in recent years, tobacco farmers have been ignorant and do not know how to cherish their reputation, often using "outer mountain" tobacco to impersonate "inner mountain" tobacco, or adding soil, river sand, residual stems, and rotten leaves, causing buyers to be disgusted. As a result, the Kweiting American tobacco, which was just being valued, has been rejected by the market. The provincial government has also recently decided to add a permanent inspection agency to regularly handle inspection, grading, and testing matters, in order to ensure that the production meets market needs, strictly prevent fraud, and improve quality. The US government has strictly prohibited the export of American tobacco seeds. How to preserve the original variety and improve the quality in the future still requires special attention from our country's agricultural research institutions.</p>
<h3>Abundant Coal Deposits Along the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway Line: A Brief Statistical Report</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanchang, 26th of this month] At present, domestic sources of heavy coal, such as Anshan, Benxi, Beipiao, Fushun in the Northeast, as well as Kailuan, Jingxing in Hebei, Jiaozuo in Henan, Jiawang in northern Jiangsu, and Zaozhuang in southern Shandong, have been severely damaged or forced to stop production. In the future, coal supply will rely on a small number of mines in Central and Southern China before the communist bandits are completely eliminated north of the Yellow River. It will be difficult to maintain the needs of the entire industry and the civil use of major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Therefore, the center of coal production will inevitably shift to areas south of the Yangtze River in the future. The biggest task of the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway is to supply coal, which is indeed a heavy responsibility. Therefore, in addition to the construction of the main line, there is also the construction of the Quangao and Guile branch lines, which are entirely for the purpose of transporting coal.</p>
<p>At present, according to the amount of coal deposits along the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway that have been developed or have been recorded by drilling, there are quite rich treasures. For example, the Lanxi mining area in Chekiang Province has an area of 759.24 hectares and a storage capacity of about 100,000 tons. The Qu County mining area has an area of 1,385.7 hectares and a storage capacity of hundreds of thousands of tons. All were destroyed by the enemy during the War of Resistance, and there has been no power to recover them since the victory.</p>
<p>Those belonging to the territory of Kiangsi Province include the Pingxiang mining area, with a storage capacity of about 200,000,000 tons, the coal storage capacity of Leping and Poyang counties is 80,000,000 tons, and the coal storage capacity of Fengcheng is 60,000,000 tons. Other counties such as Shangrao, Yichun, Xinyu, and Jinxian also have bituminous coal deposits, but they are all mined by indigenous methods, and the output is extremely low.</p>

<p>"In accordance with the measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, this committee conducted an inspection of the Gold Yuan Certificate reserves at the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank on September 30, 1948. The results of the inspection are publicly announced as follows:</p>

<p>Reserves: [Gold] 2,389,493.638 ounces, calculated at USD 35 per ounce, totaling 83,632,277.33 yuan.</p>
<p>[Silver] 17,222,637.528 ounces, calculated at USD 0.70 per ounce, totaling 12,055,846.27 yuan.</p>
<p>The above two items combined amount to USD 95,688,123.60, converted to 382,752,494.40 yuan in Gold Yuan Certificates.</p>

<p>The above reserves are consistent with the legal 100% reserve system (40% being gold, silver, and foreign exchange).</p>
<p>The reserves to be kept by this committee, according to the Executive Yuan's announcement, (1) two hundred million US dollars in gold, silver, and foreign exchange, have been handed over by the Central Bank to the committee for safekeeping by the Issuance Bureau according to the organizational regulations, (2) stock deeds of state-owned enterprises and enemy assets worth three hundred million US dollars have also been transferred to the committee for safekeeping by the Issuance Bureau. The above-mentioned reserves for the issued Gold Yuan Certificates are a portion of the total number of reserves received and kept in this case. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Also, since the implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Management, the results have been good. The people support the group policy, and the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies has been very active. According to reliable information revealed by the Central Bank, the total amount of Gold Yuan Certificates issued as of the end of September was over 950 million Gold Yuan, of which the expenditure for recouping gold, silver, and foreign currencies was equivalent to about 150 million US dollars, totaling 600 million Gold Yuan. The recouping of Legal Tender and Northeast Certificates was about 50 million Gold Yuan. Net income from import and export settlement and remittances from overseas Chinese was about 20 million US dollars, totaling 80 million Gold Yuan. The remaining 220 million Gold Yuan was the expenditure of the national treasury and other businesses after the currency reform.</p>
<h3>Sparse Crowds on the Market: Rice Market Enters Stagnation, Grain Transactions Decline, Oil Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Rice market transactions are still stagnant. Market quotations remain the same, but no transactions are taking place. Although fellow traders still come to the market, they leave soon after due to the lack of transactions. The market is sparsely populated, and the closing time is quite early. Yesterday's registered arrivals were 710 "shi" in the south market, including 480 "shi" of inferior rice, and 973 "shi" in the north market. Transactions were almost zero.</p>
<p>Flour remains suspended and not open for business. Due to the small amount of wheat arriving, the mills are unable to supply the market due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials. According to this situation, market transactions will be difficult to resume in the short term, but the distribution of flour by the mills will continue as usual.</p>
<p>Grain transactions have declined. There are very few transactions in various grains. About 200 bags of Poyang Zi soybeans were offered, and Taigai competed to buy them. Other transactions were scattered. More than 30 bags of Yuan wheat were offered, and some corn was also offered. Green beans and red beans were not offered. There were still many sesame transactions, and no raw peanuts were offered.</p>
<p>Edible oil transactions are still booming. Soybean oil has risen by another 45 cents, nearing the limit. The price is 51.9 yuan. Many units were offered by the factories, including Datong Factory and Zhongzhi Factory. Shencaiyou and other factories also offered some units. The price is 47.3 yuan, also approaching the limit price. Jilutong oil from Qilu Company was offered with hot rapeseed oil. Pure raw oil is stable, and small cart oil is still at the limit price. 400 pieces of Datong soybean cake were offered.</p>
<h3>Strong Overseas Demand: Bright Prospects for the Tea Market</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] This reporter recently visited the tea magnate Mr. Zhu Xijin. According to him, when shipments of export tea to Shanghai were continuous this year, it coincided with the time when the Chinese government revised the exchange control measures to encourage exports, thereby invigorating people's hearts and causing the market situation to improve daily. By August 19th, the authorities announced the currency reform and re-established the exchange rate, so export goods benefited even more and showed a vigorous atmosphere. Tea, in particular, due to the sharp decline in production and urgent overseas demand, those holding goods are optimistic. Their firm sales mentality is almost incomparable to the mood to sell two years ago, resulting in shining prices. However, transactions are formed by negotiation, and opening deals is inevitably narrow, but the future will surely be more dazzling. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, this street and Suzhou-Wuxi and other places are still okay, but in the case of demand, they have been circling the original route.</p>
<h3>Grain Market Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors of the opening up of sugar again stimulated the market, and people's hearts were re-invigorated. Outside merchants frequently came to buy, and local merchants also rose up to add to their purchases. Prices were shouted up and the upward trend was very strong. After the opening of the 21st-term sandy white stock order, there were buyers but no sellers. Coarse and medium-sized sand were also firm and popular. The market for No. 45 car white refined sugar was still stable at the beginning of the market, but then popular grades rose together, and the price also rose in a straight line. Xinghua red sugar became weaker because the supply increased. Other grades rose by about one yuan.</p>
<h3>State-Owned Enterprise Stocks: Building Stocks Sold the Most</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] After the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, as of October 1st, a total of 2,992,400 Gold Yuan were sold in various places, with Building Stocks selling the most and Tianjin Paper selling the least. The actual sales figures for various stocks are as follows: Building Stocks 2,832,500 Gold Yuan; China Merchants 45,000 Gold Yuan; Taiwan Sugar 1,024,200 Gold Yuan; Taiwan Paper 86,700 Gold Yuan; Tianjin Paper 4,000 Gold Yuan.</p>
<h3>Loan Interest Rates of Banks and Credit Institutions: Monthly Interest Rate Must Not Exceed 3%</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] After the currency reform, regarding the loan interest rates of various banks and credit institutions, the Joint Treasury stipulated that they should be calculated according to the new method from August 23rd, with the highest not exceeding a monthly interest rate of 3%.</p>
<p>However, it is learned that the various banks and credit institutions proposed to handle this in a flexible manner, and submitted a request to the 371st meeting of the Board of Directors of the Joint Treasury for approval. The reply was as follows: (1) The deposit and loan interest rates handled by state-owned banks and credit institutions should be handled in accordance with the Measures for the Restriction of Deposit and Loan Interest Rates of Banks promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and should be revised in accordance with the previously stipulated principles. Regardless of the newly written loan interest rate, interest should be calculated from August 23rd of this year, with the highest not exceeding a monthly interest rate of 3%. However, industrial and mining loans that were due before August 23rd but have not yet been repaid will be allowed to accrue overdue interest in accordance with banking practices.</p>
<p>(2) Deposit interest rates should be proposed by local banks and credit institutions in consultation within the scope stipulated by laws and regulations, and then reported to the office for record.</p>
<h3>Gold Yuan Certificates Are Temporarily Not Circulating in Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] Regarding the question of whether Gold Yuan Certificates can be circulated and used in Taiwan, according to the person in charge of the Central Bank, it has been approved by the Ministry of Finance that Gold Yuan Certificates should not be circulated in Taiwan for the time being, but can be exchanged for Taiwan currency at the Bank of Taiwan at the exchange rate of 1:835. Travelers carrying Gold Yuan Certificates to other ports in the country from Taiwan, or carrying Gold Yuan Certificates to Taiwan from other ports in the country, should be limited to 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rubber Import Quotas: The Transportation Management Adjusts the Ratio</h3>
<p>The Import Quota Allocation Office has adjusted the import quotas for rubber and its related categories starting from the sixth quarter. The quota for raw rubber has been increased, accounting for 68.5%, totaling USD 704,232. The quota for Guangdong skin has been reduced, accounting for 1.5%, totaling USD 15,421. The quota for tires accounts for 26.5%, totaling USD 72,440. The quota for other products accounts for 3%, totaling USD 30,824. In addition, in order to consider the adjustment and use of it, a type of user who cannot participate in the allocation of user quotas has been added for reserve purposes, accounting for 0.5%, totaling USD 5,140. Regarding the above allocation, the Transportation Management Committee has now obtained the opinion of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, which believes that the tire quota should be limited to automobile and aircraft tires. Other tires can be self-supplied domestically and do not need to be imported. In the future, the tire quota can be fully allocated to import tire manufacturing parts in order to gradually reduce the import of tires.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Trend Returns to Fatigue, Cloth Unanimously Booms and Rises to Limit</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw good trading at the morning open, with strong buying interest, and all yarns were bid up to the limit line. The popular 60-count "Flying Goddess" yarn was at 1,285 yuan, and 42-count "Golden Double Chicken" was at 1,060 yuan. Subsequently, rumors spread that state-owned and private yarn factories would stop allocating yarn to wholesale merchants, which immediately caused anxiety among the industry, and trading turned quiet, causing the market to return to fatigue.</p>
<p>The prices of various fine yarns, such as 42-count, 40-count, and 32-count, as well as 21-count "Double Horse" yarn, all hovered at the limit line. However, within the 21-count yarn market, supply was scarce and demand was high, so transactions were made at the limit price. The momentum of coarse yarns, such as 16-count and 10-count, was ordinary, and the market fluctuated in a soft range. The "Spinning and Construction Company" opened sales of a type of 20-count "Longevity" yarn at a price of 700 yuan, and applications were limited to clothing, knitwear, towels, bedding, handkerchiefs, canvas, and yarn merchants registered with numbers 301 to the end.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw strong buying interest and high morale. Although the Wing On Textile Factory opened allocations of "Dapeng" fine cloth, and the "Spinning and Construction Company" followed suit with allocations, the rising trend was difficult to curb. Sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth initially rose slightly by one corner, but then local shops competed to buy, and the price rose again by six corners. Some people bought in, and later the Chamber of Commerce directors and Wing On Textile Factory sold 2,640 bolts of fine cloth and "Four Gentlemen" gold-printed Yuan serge. The market closed in the afternoon at 28.40 yuan, a significant increase of 5 corners compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>"Dragon Head" D-type and "Five Blessings Trumpet" and other types of cloth all rose to the limit immediately after opening. Serge was in high demand at the time, and "Four Gentlemen" white-printed serge, "Golden Fortune Wonderful Dance Jumping Carp," and second-grade products were all traded. Because the "Spinning and Construction Company" allocated a considerable amount of cloth the previous day, only "Four Gentlemen" Yuan serge edged up by one corner, while the rest of the market remained stable. A total of 1,480 yuan worth of transactions were made throughout the day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Wing On Textile Factory allocated 2,000 bolts of 12-pound "Dapeng" fine cloth (20 bolts per package) in the cotton cloth market yesterday. The allocation price was 28 gold yuan per bolt. Applicants could stamp and prepare slips before 3 pm, indicating their membership number, and apply for allocation. The names of the approved applicants would be announced next Monday (the 4th). Those who received allocations were required to submit a bank draft endorsed by a director to the Cotton Cloth Association before 10 am the next day (the 5th) to exchange for a warehouse receipt.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai held the fourth phase of the third joint allocation of yarn from private yarn factories yesterday (the 2nd). A total of 1,025 bales of 20-count cotton yarn were allocated. Also, the total amount of yarn and cloth opened for sale by various factories on the 1st and 2nd of this month was equivalent to 995 bales of 20-count cotton yarn and 28,822 bolts of cotton cloth. It is understood that the current selling price of cotton in the production areas is lower than the cost, and how to maintain the production costs of yarn factories is a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Allows Price Drops</p>
<p>Yesterday, no spot cotton transactions were made. The inventory in the industry is becoming increasingly thin, and the market has been sluggish for a long time. The price of rice in the suburbs of Shanghai has risen, and cotton farmers are unwilling to sell cheaply. Coarse and fine cotton have long been unavailable in Shanghai. It is now reported that even cottonseeds in Zhoupu are priced but unavailable.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Association Suggests a Comprehensive Joint Purchase of National Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai held an interim meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon starting at 2 pm. As a result of the discussion, they passed a proposal to change the government's decided key joint purchase system for national cotton to a comprehensive joint purchase system. The key joint purchase system is limited to Shanghai and Hankou, which will cause market confusion in areas outside the joint purchase area. It would cause cotton in the joint purchase area to escape to the non-joint purchase areas, which is not a good policy. A comprehensive joint purchase system, in addition to Shanghai and Hankou, would include other important national cotton strongholds such as Nantong, Xi'an, Shashi, Ningbo, Pudong, and Taijia, so as to standardize the system. It is heard that this proposal is comprehensive and will be submitted to the National Yarn Factory Federation for approval before being recommended to the National Cotton Joint Purchase Association for adoption and implementation.</p>

<h3>Chinese Sociological Society Opens Its Ninth Annual Meeting; Gu Zhenggang and Pound Attend and Give Speeches</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 2nd Dispatch] The Chinese Sociological Society opened its ninth annual meeting at 9 am on the 2nd in the auditorium of National Central University, and also held a celebration of the society's 20th anniversary. The chairman of the board, Mr. Wen, announced the opening of the meeting and gave a speech. Then, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech on "The Past and Present of Social Administration." In addition to reporting on the recent work of the Ministry of Social Affairs, he proposed "defining policies," "establishing systems," and "cultivating talent" as the key elements for the future development of social administration. He said that China has paid attention to social administration for a very short time, and in the past, due to the lack of both funds and talent, it has not been able to achieve the expected results. However, today's social administration and legislation are already somewhat scaled, which is still an important fact. The quality of social administration reflects the level of civilization of a country. In the future, he hoped that all sociologists would work together to promote this new cause of benefiting the people. After Mr. Gu's speech, Mr. Tian Peilin, a teacher, gave a speech on behalf of Zhu Jiahua, encouraging practical work and investigation to assist academic research. Finally, Professor Pound, an expert from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, was invited to give an academic speech, which was interpreted orally by Yang Zhaolong, director of the Criminal Division of the ministry.

<h3>Scholarships Not Yet Fully Raised; Still Awaiting Allocation from Supervisor Jiang; Special Funds from the Sale of Confiscated Materials</h3>

<h3>Searching for "Peking Man"; Allied Headquarters and Japan Have Not Found Their Whereabouts; After the Pearl Harbor Incident, the Rare Skeletal Remains Mysteriously Disappeared</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 2nd Dispatch] The skeletal remains of "Peking Man," one of the world's oldest human ancestors, discovered near Beiping in 1926, mysteriously disappeared in 1941 and may be lost to the world forever. In response to the recent request from the Chinese Mission in Japan for assistance in finding this paleontological marvel, the Allied Headquarters' Civil Property Management Office told the Chinese Mission that "based on the information currently available, no further investigation can be conducted." The Japanese Private Property Bureau stated that all efforts to find the whereabouts of this rare treasure have been ineffective. In 1941, due to the deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations, it was planned to transport "Peking Man" to the United States for preservation. The skeletal remains were packed in three boxes, labeled with the letters ABC, and were handed over to the US Marine Corps, which was about to withdraw from North China. However, on the same day, the Pearl Harbor incident broke out, and the U.S. Marines in North China were detained by the Japanese army in Qinhuangdao. Since then, "Peking Man" has disappeared. The Japanese Private Property Bureau stated that the investigation conducted by the Restoration Bureau showed that around December 1941, the Japanese army stationed in Qingdao was the 15th Brigade of the 27th Division. However, the names and current addresses of the personnel of this brigade could not be found. The relevant dates are no longer known in detail. The bureau continued that it is not yet known whether the brigade was related to the matter. It also said that the Restoration Bureau had inquired with the following people: Nakamura, Shimakanuki, and Tsukamoto, who had served as staff officers in the Japanese army in North China, but they were also unable to provide accurate information.</p>

<p>The Victory Cup volleyball tournament will continue at the Jingwu Gymnasium on Sichuan North Road starting at 3:00 PM today. It includes four elimination preliminary matches, two championship semi-quarterfinal matches, and one exhibition match. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Xiangjun vs. Turbine: 3:00 PM</p>

<p>Elimination Matches</p>
<p>The first four matches are elimination matches. Xiangjun and Turbine are both participating in formal competitions for the first time and are fighting very earnestly. Tonight, they will compete fiercely. Fanxing and Fuxingkai lack technique and experience. Hopefully, they can participate in three league seasons to improve. The China team is in poor spirits, often competing with only seven players. They may be eliminated when they meet Jixian tonight. Tiemua has considerable strength and unfortunately lost to Jingwu in the first match. There should be no problem in defeating Nanyou.</p>
<p>Championship Matches</p>
<p>In the championship semi-quarterfinals, Watson's will face Qingfeng. The former has safely passed two rounds. If they win again tonight, they will participate in the championship, which is quite hopeful. The team's soldiers use their lives and never slacken, and their spirit is even better than their skills. In another match, St. John's will face the China team. St. John's is like a Class A team and has the ambition to win the championship. The generals of the China team are also very strong, and they will pose a serious threat to St. John's tonight.</p>
<p>Exhibition Match</p>
<p>In the exhibition match, the referees will play against the Fuhua women's team. Fuhua requested to participate, but the organizers did not allow them to join due to the regulations, so they were given an exhibition opportunity. Although the referees are used to enforcing the law, they also have some skills in spiking. There will be many wonderful performances at that time. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Fuhua</p>
<p>Lü Xianchun, Zhu Qinmei, Lin Yinye</p>

<p>[This Newspaper News] The Sports Reporters Association of this city will host a basketball performance to send off the Dagong basketball team, which is about to go abroad to the south, and to bid farewell to the city's fans.

It is inevitable that they will cause a sensation among the fans at that time.</p>
<h3>C1 Table Tennis League: Lingyun Wins the Finals Qualification</h3>
<p>In the C1 division of the table tennis league, Lingyun defeated Yinglian Hei 7-2 the day before yesterday. At 8:00 PM last night, they played against Luying Lü at the Jingfen ball room. Lingyun had a strong momentum, and the three young players were agile. Wang Weirong captured three generals alone. With another victory of 6-3, they won the finals qualification and will compete with Xingguang for the division championship on a scheduled date. In the B division, two games were also important battles. As a result, Luying Qingnian each won 6-3 against their opponents and advanced.

<h3>Crisis</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>I have long known that our country's Four Books and Five Classics, as well as Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, and the like, have English translations. Visiting Western bookstores, I saw numerous books and pictorials written by Westerners about China, so many that one cannot count them all. Moreover, I discovered that Qu Yuan's works have translations in several languages, Sima Qian's Historical Records have a French translation by Mr. Edouard Chavannes, and there is a German monograph on Lü Buwei by Mr. Richard Wilhelm. I could not help but be surprised and admired the Westerners' enthusiasm for learning.</p>
<p>Some say this is not surprising, as our country also has Chinese translations of European and American works.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>However, looking at the current state of our culture from a broader perspective, there is indeed a reason for us to be pessimistic. For example, in terms of English-Chinese dictionaries, in terms of diligence and comprehensiveness, the existing ones in our country are mostly far inferior to similar products from Japan. Japanese-compiled English-Japanese dictionaries are often more accurate and detailed than our country's English-Chinese dictionaries. Looking back at Chinese-English dictionaries: So far, the more complete Chinese-English dictionaries are still the two compiled by Westerners H. Giles and Mathew. The Chinese-English dictionaries published by our country's publishing industry are mostly copied from Westerners; even if they are copied, they are not as complete. These types of works are being improved daily in Europe and America. As for our country, it is still the original few. To this day, we can't even afford to do the copying and printing work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our "ancient" things were first studied using scientific methods by Stein and others who were not Chinese; the phonology of our Chinese characters was organized into a scientific system by Karlgren, who was not Chinese. Even some of our country's antiques, ancient books, and ancient paintings, you have to travel across the ocean to investigate and appreciate them. May I ask if our country has Shakespeare's manuscripts? Do we have authentic works by Raphael, Michelangelo, Rubens, and others? Things imported from abroad are naturally not absent, but most of them are things that you and I feel most distressed and fatal about. This is the reality, so why be surprised that culture is rolling away and foreign goods are coming in continuously?</p>
<p>Compared with the vigorous and prosperous situation of Western culture, what does this state of "substituting" indicate?</p>
<p>A recent article in the Listener Weekly discusses the crisis of world civilization, the gist of which is: (1) Civilizations can die; (2) The main cause of civilization death is war. The destruction of the Roman Empire is one example. In addition, more than 20 ancient civilizations in the past have declined and disappeared due to this; (3) If the scourge of war reaches a certain level, even if one side is defeated and one side wins, achieving a unified situation, it will be too late. Therefore, although there is peace at this time, it is only a peace due to exhaustion, and so on. These words are chilling and terrifying, not just sad.</p>
<h3>The Rich Area of America</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Millionaires have long been common and unremarkable in the southwestern American states of Texas and Oklahoma. Now there are many people with assets of five million US dollars here, because there are too many, so they are only considered "well-off." Only when a person accumulates assets of about thirty million US dollars is he considered "wealthy."</p>
<p>Texas oilman Haralson L. Hunt is probably the richest among the wealthy, and possibly the richest individual among Americans, because he is accustomed to quietness, hates cameras, and does not like to show off, so he is unknown, and even most of his fellow villagers do not know him. Hunt's oil mine property is estimated to be worth about 263 million US dollars. His total weekly income is more than one million US dollars.</p>
<p>The number of wealthy people in the southwest is truly astonishing. For example, in Fort Worth, a newspaper published a news item saying that the income tax paid by a certain family in 1947 was 3,447,000 yuan. Although there is such a clue, readers cannot accurately guess which family "a certain family" is, because there are nearly 20 families in the local area who may need to pay such a huge tax!</p>
<p>With more money, spending is naturally extravagant. Jewelers in Houston, Texas, do not find a transaction of 20,000 US dollars to be rare. Three stores selling women's supplies in the area say that selling clothes priced from 400 to 1,000 yuan is not difficult. A store recently put out four sable fur hats priced at 1,500 yuan each, and they were sold out on the first day. Last February, a car company in Dallas sold two cars priced at nearly 20,000 yuan each on its opening day. Another car dealer sold more than 1,000 cars last year.</p>
<p>The Neiman Marcus department store in Dallas has about 90,000 charge account customers, of which nearly 300 customers spend more than 50,000 yuan a year, and a few customers spend 150,000 yuan a year on goods! The extravagance can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Generals of the Yang Family</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The story of the Yang family generals has long been deeply rooted in society and is known to women and children. Especially general theatergoers, regarding Cheng Changgeng's "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," Tan Xinpei's "Li Ling Stele," and all the plays of the Yang family, feel more and more enjoyable to talk about and listen to with relish. However, according to historical facts, there are many differences. A brief account is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yang Ye: Ye is the main character in the play "Li Ling Stele," and is now honored as Lord Yang. Originally a famous general of the Northern Han, formerly known as Liu Jiye, after the surrender of the Northern Han, he still fought hard to defend the city. Emperor Taizong of Song ordered the Lord of the Northern Han to recruit him before he surrendered. He resumed the surname Yang, only named Ye, and was appointed as the governor of Daizhou. He was famous for his good fighting, and people at that time called him Yang the Invincible. He once led hundreds of cavalry to break 100,000 Khitan soldiers. The Khitan were afraid and fled whenever they saw his banners. Later, he was harmed by Wang Shen, who forced him to go to Shuozhou and was ambushed and defeated. He fought hard and suffered dozens of injuries. Most of his soldiers were killed. He was shot and fell from his horse and was captured. He died without eating. His son Yanyu also died in battle. More than 100 people remained under his command. When defeated, Ye ordered them to escape and return, but they were grateful and refused to retreat, and also died in battle. According to the plot of Li Ling, although there are many additional details, it is generally not contrary to the facts.</p>
<p>(2) Pan Mei: Mei was a famous general of the Song Dynasty, with great military achievements. He is commonly known as the traitorous Pan Renmei, or Pan Hong, which is probably a shadow on Mei. According to the records, when attacking the Khitan, Mei was the chief deployment officer, and Ye was his deputy. They won every battle. When Cao Bin's army was defeated, they were summoned back. At that time, the Khitan were powerful, and the generals abandoned the city and fled. Mei went to rescue but was also defeated. Ye believed that it would only lose soldiers and be of no benefit, so he advocated avoiding their edge. The supervising army, Shen, said that Ye was always known as invincible, and not fighting was a sign of disloyalty. He had no choice but to lead his troops to Shuozhou, and agreed with Mei to deploy troops at Chenjiagukou for support. Mei agreed. The Khitan pretended to be defeated to lure Ye. Shen thought they had won and led his troops forward to compete for merit. When he heard of the defeat, he led his troops to escape, and Mei could not control him. Ye fought to the valley and did not see a single soldier. He cried bitterly and fought again, and was captured and died. It can be seen that the one who harmed Ye was Shen, and it is not in line with the facts to attribute the traitor to Mei. (Note: Shen was very treacherous and once falsely accused Tian Renlang. After Ye's death, he was removed from office.)</p>
<p>(3) Yang Yanzhao: Yanzhao was Ye's son, commonly known as Yang Liulang. When the Khitan invaded on a large scale, the Song army was defeated, and they took advantage of the victory to attack the city. The city was small and unprepared, and the people were in fear. Yanzhao gathered the people and defended the city firmly. The weather was very cold, and the water poured on the city turned into ice, which was firm and slippery and could not be climbed. The Khitan then withdrew. He was re-elected as a frontier general and ordered to be in charge of Baozhou. At that time, it was said that he was the right person.</p>
<p>(4) Empress Xiao: The Empress was the wife of the Khitan lord Xian and the mother of Longxu. She monopolized power for many years, had resourcefulness, and was good at controlling ministers. She personally wore armor to supervise the battle in every battle. She also conspired to make peace with the Song. However, she was cruel and bloodthirsty and had an affair with Prime Minister Han Derang. Not long after the Queen died, Derang also died and was buried next to her mausoleum.</p>
<p>According to the above historical facts, it can be seen that the Yang family generals were not fictitious, but Pan Mei was not without injustice, and Empress Xiao was promiscuous and cruel, similar to the Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty. However, her military exploits and political achievements, and the fact that her son Longxu mourned to the point of death after her death, were all things that the Empress Dowager Cixi could not match.</p>
<h3>Returning to Thatched Cottage in Autumn</h3>
<p>— Chen Dingshan</p>
<p>High willows and broken bridge to the west of the gate, climbing the steps, you can lift your steps. You can hear the joy of crows and sparrows in vain. Recent people pay to let butterflies fly low.</p>
<p>Are the old osmanthus trees in the mountains all in bloom? Half-yellow is covered with family rice wine in the house. The sunny skies have delayed for ten days, and heavy sunshine and rain will unfold on the Double Ninth Festival.</p>
<p>The rice congee is smooth like flowing, and the mountains are great, so I will seek rice for survival first. I stopped my cup and try to tell of my healthy body. Unexpectedly there is a new pine covered with snow on its head. (New snow on pines in the country)</p>
<p>Flowers closed and withered, revealing the empty island. Short water caltrop and long arrowhead fill the eyes in autumn. I suspect new poems are born in the depths of my eyes. Hanging willows are separated by a heavy sorrow.</p>
<h3>Fierce Bean</h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>Not stained by silt, lotus is called the gentleman; alone in her later years, the chrysanthemum is admired as a superior. Strong grass in a strong wind, pine and cypress in the cold winter, are all worthy of being valued. Among the green beans, there is also the so-called "fierce bean." Zheng Eryang of the Ming Dynasty said: "Often there are green beans that do not rot when cooked. People call them fierce beans, also called iron beans, and the name is very good. In the midst of fierce fire and boiling water, all the beans are糜烂 (mí làn, mushy), but this bean alone can be firm as iron, with eyes intact, without any damage. It can truly be said to enter water without getting wet, and enter fire without burning. It is appropriate to call it fierce!... I often say that even when the world is vast and extremely decayed, there must be places that are not decayed. Relying on the ordinary sight and hearing outside of prosperity, there is a generation of blood-boiling men. One cannot say that a clear and bright world has been completely ruined by those who want to ride crane carriages and wear monkey hats."</p>
<p>In the midst of fierce fire and boiling water, without following the 糜烂 of the beans, but being firm and intact alone, it is fitting to call them fierce. It is known that hardship and danger are indeed the great touchstones of humanity. And "even when the world is vast and extremely decayed, there must be places that are not decayed," this is why history continues. Loyal, righteous, and independent scholars never cease in history, and it is precisely by relying on such blood-boiling men outside of ordinary sight and hearing that a righteous spirit is left for heaven and earth.</p>
<h3>Eastern Scales and Western Claws</h3>
<p>— Jinlin</p>
<p>Southern California in the United States has the world's largest aqueduct, with a total length of 242 miles, most of which can be driven by cars. It is used to supply drinking water to 13 city residents, providing 1,000,000,000 gallons of water per day.</p>
<p>When a hummingbird is flying, it flaps its wings 75 times per second, and when soaring, it flaps 40 times per second. This is based on counts from high-speed cameras.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that the country with the most inventors in the world is either the United States or Germany. In fact, in proportion to the population, the country with the most inventors is Switzerland.</p>
<p>Yellowstone Park in the United States covers an area of ​​3,500 square miles. In terms of hot springs alone, there are already two or three hundred. The magnificent beauty of the scenery is amazing!</p>
<h3>Good People and Bad People</h3>
<p>— Erjia</p>
<p>Wu Sansi said: "I don't know who are good people and who are bad people in the world; but those who are good to me are good people, and those who are bad to me are bad people." Yuan Jianzhai said: "This kind of view is often held by the virtuous gentlemen of today, and even Cheng and Zhu in ancient times could not avoid falling into this disease, but they are not willing to say it as directly as Wu Sansi." Looking at Sansi's words today, they still feel fresh and pleasing.</p>
<h3>The Limit of Self-Preservation</h3>
<p>— Erjia</p>
<p>Yang Jimin of Ming Dynasty's Mingliang Records said: "When Qian Fangbo was an imperial censor, he confiscated the property of the eunuch Wang Zhen. There was a golden Guanyin statue with an inscription on the back: Filial grandson Zhou Chen worships, dedicated by Duke Wenxiang." The note says: "This is similar to Xie Taifu enduring hunger and fatigue to see Huan Wen. Is it to preserve oneself wisely, regardless of minor setbacks?"</p>
<p>In reality, a gentleman's "preserving oneself wisely" should not lose his integrity too much. For example, Chen Taiqiu's mourning for Zhang Rang and Du Zhengnan's bribery of courtiers do not lose the meaning of preserving oneself wisely. If Zhou Chen offers tribute to Wang Chen and calls himself "filial grandson", this is the lowest level of flattery, no different from sucking ass and licking hemorrhoids. How can it be compared to Xie Taichuan's enduring hunger and fatigue, and only called a "minor setback"?</p>
<p>As for using self-preservation as an excuse to become a traitor, accept unjust wealth, and so on, it goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Reading Churchill's Memoirs</h3>
<p>— Lezhi</p>
<p>Churchill's book is a famous work in English. I have read both the Commercial Press translation and the original text. Britain was in a very difficult position during World War II. Churchill shouldered heavy responsibilities, and retired successfully. Naturally, there are many words to warn against past failures and instruct the future. This book was not casually written. The subtle meaning of the whole book does not lie in blaming past misfortunes, but in reminding the world that politics is ultimately not rational but emotional. Because it is not rational, so mistakes are repeated, and people knowingly commit them. If things go on like this, the world order will still not be guaranteed, which means that mankind's political ideals have not yet been fully realized. Moreover, from the perspective of combining the past and present, the inside and outside, and the dynamic and static aspects, it is still doubtful whether humans are good creatures with political abilities. Reading Churchill's book, one is not saddened by the past, but more fearful for the future.</p>
<p>He said: The national character of the British is peace-loving, but when danger comes, the more dangerous, the more calm, and the more unbreakable. This must be very correct. However, every nation in the world has its national characteristics. How can we understand the characteristics of each nation and make them progress together peacefully? If the Germans had understood the British characteristics earlier, they would probably not have launched military action against Poland. Then there would have been the possibility of avoiding or delaying the war until several years later before it started. Hitler mistakenly thought that Chamberlain was an honest and deceivable person, so he dared to take great risks. This is probably the meaning Churchill wants to explain. In the early stages of World War II, Britain was the master and the United States was the follower. After the war, the situation was that the United States was the master and Britain was the follower. At that time, Germany mistakenly thought that Britain and the United States were weak, and tried step by step. After a few years, some people mistakenly thought that Britain and the United States were weak, and tried step by step. Before 1939, who could determine when Britain and the United States would rise up and take up arms? Churchill said that the two pages of history will not be entirely the same, there will always be some different nuances. How profound and sad are these words? The small details are different, but the big patterns are simply repeated.</p>
<p>Not only wars, but also the political, economic, and cultural problems in peacetime are the same as before, and even problems that have been around for hundreds of years have not been improved. The various nations of Europe have many innate problems that they cannot solve, and even their own shortcomings cannot be improved. When there is danger, there is a burst of anxiety; once things have passed, everything remains the same. Churchill's description of various circumstances, for his British allies and foreign countries, is naturally very euphemistic and unwilling to expose their shortcomings, but it is also enough to see their corruption. As far as Britain is concerned, its political system is indeed sounder than other countries, and it can maintain stability and respond to changes. The general situation of the society is also worthy of being able to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens to seek survival from death. Churchill fully represents British politicians, and his phase industry is admirable. However, the position of Britain is not to allow one country to be too strong, and yet some countries must be strong enough to watch the door for her. How can this two-way question be done well?</p>
<p>The translation is quite smooth and fluent, especially the fact that it is composed by many hands but does not show any inconsistencies before and after, and is simply as if it came from one hand, which is very rare and valuable. However, some of the subtle places in the original text where emotion and language are intertwined cannot be expressed properly. Therefore, I think that our current popular writing style, in addition to explanatory writing, seems to be still poor and monotonous, and does not teach twists and turns and richness.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Renting a House Without a Contract is Considered an Indefinite Lease</h3>
<p>Yu Shen asked: I recently rented a room from a friend, which is between their affairs/servant quarter and the inner rooms. I have now moved in and registered my household. Because our friendship is harmonious, we did not draw up a lease contract, and there are no receipts for the rent paid. May I ask, according to this fact, is there a rental relationship established in law? Can registering my household be an indication of renting? I respectfully ask for your guidance, and I am greatly grateful. [Answered by Lawyer Chuan Kuangling] Regarding the situation described in your letter, renting the room and registering your household without a written contract is considered an indefinite lease, which is legally valid.</p>
