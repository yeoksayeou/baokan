<p>〔本報特寫〕「李宗仁得票一四三八張，當選爲中華民國第一届副總統。」第四次選舉副總統大會的主席于斌，在報吿選舉結果後，會塲裏大部份人都熱烈的鼓掌了。而在選票未　最後結果，李宗仁勝利在望的時候，李夫人郭德潔女士，就爲若干在塲記者所圍繞，當結果揭曉後，李夫人也就被人羣擁出門外，高高抬起，拱衛着，在歡聲裏攝下了我們首届副總統夫人的玉照。</p>
<p>李宗仁當選逼總統的消息，在一時零五分的時候，廣播電台己經把他播送到全國各個角落。一時一刻，從大會堂裏出來，街衢上迎接你的是一片僅弱於大總統當選時的爆竹聲。</p>
<p>副總統的選舉，眞可說已經達到熱烈，緊張的境地，更說得過分一點，是幾乎達到了嚴重的階段。昨天三選的結果是李宗仁孫科兩氏取得決賽資格的，但是那落選了的程潛的五一五票，就成了今天決賽的基本目標。昨夜一夜功夫，李孫兩位候選人在這五一五票上，做了不少工作。今天一早，李宗仁偕同夫人分赴各代表旅邸招呼，拉票。孫科也派了專人在下關車站，迎接由上海來京專誠投票的代表。開會以前，李宗仁依然站在大門第一崗位，迎接每一個代表，夫人是第二道崗位。再進去就是孫科和他的夫人，孫科親蒞會塲，今天還是第一次，握一握手，爭取最後的一票。雖然，這是極明顯的拉票壁壘，但是誰不是一副笑臉？而且，李夫人的擅長交際，曾經特地走過來和孫夫人歡笑握手，兩位副總統候選人的夫人，實際上說來，是要比兩位候選人更其緊張的。程潛之落選，就有人歸咎於沒有把夫人帶來做競選高參！否則，三夫人的參謀太部相爭，恐怕競選塲而將更爲熱烈。</p>
<p>會塲裏的空氣，雖不能說很溫和平靜，但是這種箭在弦上的緊張空氣，顯然已經從前幾天的爭爭吵吵，到了收藏到內心的戰鬥。因此四選投票，一切順利進行。在投票的過程中，會塲裏交頭接耳的，正是展開着若干花樣新奇的賭注，分別猜測這最後勝利者是誰？有人說以李宗仁「向領先的優勢來說，今天的勝利應該還是他：有人說程潛的五百多票將有大多數投給了孫科；只要一票之差，就可以當選，勝利者可能是孫科。但是衆說紛紜，壓寶從沒有百分之百的準確的。</p>
<p>在投票進行中，曾經有一個可感的小插曲：女代表林範文爲助選工作而病倒了，但是今天依然拖着不能舉步了的身軀，爲了投這神聖而重要的一票，臨時請會塲幹事扶着她去親自投這一票。從這裏，我們可以看出競爭之熱烈，以及一票也不放棄的認眞。</p>
<p>投票完成後，繼十一時卅七分開始了最緊張的唱票。在二七三三次唱名裏，分了十二個票匭的階段。從十二次的統計數字裏，看出李宗仁佔有了三分之二的領先數字。而且雙方或多或少，凡是李領先的數字距離總數多，孫多時則距離有限，因此當李宗仁一馬當先，適中三元以後，孫科的票，雖然在第四次中多出了二十五票，但依然是總數距離太遠。開票到第六匭時，雙方相距已近兩百票，但接着第七匭開出，孫的票數比李幾多出六十票之數，曾使合塲空氣有點小議論，因爲開票到這裏，正是一半的當兒，如有轉變，孫科可能後來居上。不過在這以後，就一蹶不振，到第十匭結束時，李是一一五九，孫氏一〇一三，和昨天三選結果相差無幾。孫氏助選團誰都在等候這最後兩匭的優勢，但結果是：孫科十二匭的得票總額是一二九五·而李宗仁十一匭的總額是一二九五·李宗仁在第十二票匭所得的一四三票，就是決定他當選的勝利票。在開票到十一票匭，孫科趨勢已低落時，若干代表已紛紛離席而去，反之，另一個角落的空氣就熱烈了，當最後的統計揭曉時，歡呼也從那一個角落裏爆發了。</p>
<p>副總統的地位顯然不能和大總統相比，但是，因爲他經過了四次的搏鬥，所以在情緒上說，他比總統的產生更爲熱烈。（四月廿九日於南京）</p>

<h3>副總統選舉的揭曉　——祝李宗仁將軍當選副總統</h3>
<p>昨日國民大會舉行副總統第四次投票，當塲開票結果，李宗仁將軍以一四三八票對一二九五票之多數，當選爲我國行憲後第一任副總統，消息傳出，京滬各地民衆聞訊，無不深慶得人：對於這次國民大會已完成其基本任務，亦無不以愉快的心情來祝賀國民大會圓滿閉幕。</p>
<p>依照我國憲法第四十九條的規定，「總統缺位時，由副總統繼任，至總統任期届滿爲止。」副總統平時雖無實權；但遇總統缺位時，即由其代理總統職權；所以副總統的地位，也非常重要，這次參加競選者共有六人，李·孫·程·于·莫·徐諸公，都是德高望重的黨國先進，不僅能克李輿情，爲衆望所歸；而且對於副總統的職位，均能勝任而有餘。惟第一第二兩次投票的結果，均以李孫二公得票最多；惜未能超過半數，因此均不能當選。正要在舉行第三次投票之際，會內會外謠言四起，暗流汹湧，再加以助選團的過於熱心，推波助瀾，引起三位候選人的誤會，先後發表聲明，表示放棄競選，幾乎引起政治上的軒然大波，幸赖國大主席團的處理有方，一方面決定國大休會三天，以鎭壓道塲虛驚，另一方面則由憂國之士四出奔走及疏　，除了在法律上覓取解決辦法而外，並重申自由投票的最高原則，如此，乃使首都的戾氣除消，謠言澄淸，誤會冰釋，而能於廿八日繼續開會，舉行第三次投票；在全國人民萬目睽睽的注視之下，會塲秩序與投票情形，均有條不紊，足見流言蜚語都是無中生有。國大經過這一次的風波之後，反而有長足的進步，誠可謂「失敗爲成功之母」，國大的成就，格外値得我們的珍視。我國民主憲政尚在學習的階段，自應從學習中求進步，更應珍重這次選舉所獲得的敎訓。</p>
<p>第一，競選宣傳應有一個限度。在理論上，凡是有利自己及不利於對方的宣傳，均所不禁，但是宣傳的內容，應以闡揚自己的政見及攻擊對方政策的不當為限，而且在投票的時候，最好能實行「宣傳休戰」；否則雙方從事宣傳戰，愈演愈烈，傳單標　滿街飛，報章雜　互相攻擊，終不免意氣用事，引起雙方的誤會。選舉是民主政治的基點，培養良好的襲擊風氣，尚在學習民主的階級之中國，尤其感到迫切的需要。</p>
<p>第二，無記名的秘密投票是自由投票最好的保證。在選舉風潮的過程中，雖然也有候選人指摘大會操縱選舉，使國大代表不能自由投票；但現在事實證明，此種指摘毫無根據，因爲在代表　名投票的時候，旣無人在旁監察，也沒有人去障礙，完全可以憑自己的良心自由投票，以金錢賄選的流弊，固然不會發生；就是用武力威脅代表投票，也不會發生效力，所以我們希望政府今後不論舉行何種選舉，都應該實行無記名的秘密投票，以保證自由投票的最高原則。</p>
<p>要之，選舉具有敎育的意義，經過這次副總統選舉，我們旣以獲得許多珍貴的敎訓，就應後這些敎訓中求進步。故吾人在獲悉李宗仁將軍膺選之後，一方面希望李將軍以其十餘年來獻身革命的精神，輔助元首革新政治及軍事，早日完成戡亂建國的大業；另一方面並祝我國民生憲政在學習中求進步，能有光明燦爛的前程！</p>
<h3>遼望中東的烽火</h3>
<p>巴勒斯坦的戰事，自在海法和雅法兩地先後爆發之後，烽火蔓延，大有燎原之勢，益發不可收拾了。一方面猶太人在激進派伊爾根的領導之下，已於廿八日佔領雅法港，使聖城耶路撒冷也感受直接威脅；另一方面阿刺伯聯盟各國如外約但，叙利亞，黎巴嫩曁埃及等國，也準備於五月一日開始侵入巴勒斯坦，如此，巴勒斯坦境內的戰亂，也將演變爲中東的國際戰爭了。聖地之　的曼延和擴大，不特使美國外交當局深感不安，就是在一般愛好和平的人士，對於中東火藥庫的爆發，也不得不表示無限的憂慮。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦問題，雖然是一個宗敎和民族分歧的問題，自交英國代治三十餘年來，猶阿雙方發生衝突，幾乎無日無之；但若無外來的因素參雜其間，問題究竟單純，不難覓獲合理的解決。所以巴勒斯坦問題惡化到此地步，實爲强權政治鬥爭所造成的惡果。尤其是英美的政策常舉棋不定，應負重大的實任。英國對於巴勒斯坦一直採取「分而治之」的政策，處處欲利用猶阿雙方衝突的矛盾，故作依違，俾處於舉足輕重的地位。此在美國亦復相同，在第二次大戰結束之後，美國的態度，顯然僵向猶太人，主張巴勒斯坦實行分治，並贊助猶太人的復國運動；但現在又主張託治了。</p>
<p>原來巴勒斯坦分洽計劃，只有利於猶太復國運動及歐洲難民問題的解決，自然要引起中東阿刺伯各國的反感。加以在事實上，這個分治計劃能否實現，也是一個問題，因爲巴勒斯坦的面積不大，若像印度一樣，再分割爲兩國，則此二國都不能具備現代國家應有的條件。因此美國便不得不重新考慮其態度。不過美國最重視的，不是猶阿衝突不易解決，而是阿刺伯各國的態度。換句話說，美國如若堅持己見，使聖地非實行分治不可，那末很可能激起阿刺伯各國人民的反美情緒。今日之美國最怕阿刺伯各國投到蘇聯的懷裏去，因爲美國在中東投資石油事業，單以設備一項而論，將及十六億美元；如不能博得阿刺伯各國的友好，而時常發生切斷油管的暴動，則不僅美國在中東的利益首受打擊，而且美國的援歐復興計劃，也將遭遇一大障礙。所以巴勒斯坦問題，至今也已變成了美蘇鬥爭的一環。</p>
<p>聯合國特別會議，現正在討論如何處理這個問題，馬歇爾國務卿也希望聯合國能促成猶阿雙方的休戰；但是這個問題在强權政治的鬥爭中，頗難獲得明快的解決；看情勢，中東的烽火一時無法撲滅，恐有蔓延和擴大的危險呢！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於前次江浙漁業團體要求善後事業委員會保管委員會商借漁輪二艘，予以武裝，以防海盜事，記者特向該會及漁管處有關人員探詢結果，據稱：此事恐涉及法律問題，故必須詳加研究後，始能決定。蓋根據聯總合約，聯總供我物資，規定祗作善後復興及救濟之用，不能以之作軍用，如將其漁輪裝設軍械，改成武裝，則似與原定合約有違反之處，因之該會無法立即准其所請。</p>

<h3>張彭春昨招待報告　新聞自由會議經過　大會決議訂立公約草案三件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國出席日內瓦聯合國新聞自由會議首席代表兼聯合國經濟社會理事會代表張彭春博士應聯合國駐滬辦事處之請，於昨日上午招待記者，報吿此次新聞自由會議之經過情形稱：此次會談最重要之決議，爲訂立三件公約草案，即（一）關於收集與國際時間轉　新聞者，凡任何訂約國之外國訪員，經認可者，右進人其他任何訂約國及在該國內旅行之自由並轉遞新聞；在正常狀况中，對此等新聞不應檢查，如在　平時期施行檢查，則其工作應盡可能範園，當外籍訪員之而進行。若不可能，則規定送還新聞稿之時間限度，並依照檢查後之電報字數收費。（二）關於樹立國際問更正權利者，任何訂約國均得對原來發出報道之該國政府提出更正聲明，而該政府不論其意見如何，均應公布之，否則，聯合國秘書長可受權更正並盡可能宣揚之。（三）新聞自由公約，此約內容廣泛，規定得對新聞自由施以限制。又任何兩個訂約國家若因協約而發生爭執，應移請國際法院判決。</p>
<p>上列三約草案，尙須經下屆聯合國經濟社會理事會議（七月十九日在成功湖舉行）提出修正後，交聯合國大會（九月內在巴黎舉行）通過，再由訂約國簽字批准後始有效。除上述三決議案外，新聞自由會議復經多數通過其他議案四十三件，其中有二件係由中國代表所提。此四十三議案雖非公約，但凡通過國家在這德上　對之負責。</p>
<p>參加國家　五十七個</p>
<p>張　對此次會議結果，表示十分滿意，特提出數點，認爲係以前任何國際會議所未能辦到者，即（一）參加國家特多，共五十七個（其中玻璃維亞，伊朗及愛爾蘭三國係列席者），每一國代表團中均有二三個參加實際新聞工作者，其他有外交人員或辦新聞事業人員。（二）會議準備時間有一年之久，故在程序上亦爲最成功。同時節省時間，致大會較預期早二日閉幕。該會除全體大會外，下分四小組委員會，即一·總原則上之討論，二·國際新聞之搜集，三·國內新聞之自由發表與搜集，四·法律機構。該會爲避免浪費時日，故將一般國際會議規例舉行之普通辯論移入第一小組委會，則使其他三小糾亦可同時進行，故原定會議自三月廿三日至四月廿三日結束，結果反能於廿一日閉幕。</p>
<p>新聞自由意義</p>
<p>張氏復解釋「新聞自由」之意義　，並非祗指新聞從業員之自由，而乃世界上所有人民獲得新聞之自由。</p>
<p>最後有記者詢以對此次會議認爲失敗者何在？張氏當稱，在此會議上說，失敗與成功頗難絕對劃分，有一部份認爲此會議對於國際政治之緊張空氣無大貢獻，蓋一般人目前對任何一國際會議均期望與國際政治右助，然新聞會議之性質不同，若其對國際政治無貢獻，則並非其咎。而事實上，此會議至，少並未增漲國際間緊張之政治空氣。但張氏又希望下屆之新聞自由會議，應多注意具體事實，如新聞人員之敎育·報紙印刷，機件器材及技術等問題均應詳加討。</p>
<p>張氏於昨日下午赴杭州小遊，不日晋京述職。</p>

<h3>中途一度回振　華股臨收仍弱</h3>
<p>華股昨前市欲進仍退，外股彈力，中途助長買氣，後市業中人乘隙而起，一抬之下，反動陡起，情勢較佳。但後力仍弱，臨收仍盤。</p>
<p>晨初人心仍現不支，永紗開二〇〇〇元低盤，一五四號進至二〇一〇元，檯面帮賣意仍切，一八〇號六〇號六二號亦出，退爲一九八五元低價。廣帮二〇二號力購，二〇七號等來買，銀根奇寬，回升至二〇四〇元。一四五號二二四號等脫售，退至二〇一五元。業外見穩，外股突然俏利，人心一振。大戶鄭某及廣帮紛納，一三七號等進至二〇五五元高價，二一三號等紛紛了結。十一時半後，步降至一九八五元，但午收仍由廣帮二〇二號，及紗花帮一〇四號之維持，升爲二〇〇〇元。較前收計永業微升，華新永公榮豐國貨均平，餘股除中絲跌半成外，均見小挫。</p>
<p>後市副總統業已選出，上塲低至一九八〇元，一二號賣到一九七五元，一八一號等供進，陡起買風，交易毫無，漲到二一〇〇元高價。二〇〇號等脫手，退至二〇四〇元，一八三號等力購，再升爲二〇七〇元。國行差進不少，一二九號等脫手，退至二〇四〇元。收市爲二〇五〇元，餘股咸無興致。較晨收計信和升半成，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票平和而已。</p>
<h3>統債買氣旺盛　外股高價疊出</h3>
<p>公債昨買風擴大，漲來十分俏利。統丙晨開即升爲一四萬，新買爭購，　碼奇涸，步昂至一八萬六結束。成交六百萬，較前收計甲乙升二萬一，丙漲四萬九，丁戊各好三萬二。</p>
<p>外股昨新高峯迭起，怡紗開會，英聯亦將繼之，搜買者十分殷切。怡紗自三三〇萬左右起，步漲到三五六萬頂峯，始有回落。港電報七角二，脚地仍見俏利，證券帮雖出，洋商曁廣帮爭吸，結果較前收計怡紗英聯紙版各漲半成，餘股一致微升，熱股咸見新紀錄。</p>
<h3>麥粉茶葉皮革等　停征貨物稅</h3>
<p>飲料啤酒廠商趕辦登記</p>

<h3>紗管會嚴厲執行　核定購棉價格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會爲維持棉花正常價格，對於收購棉花施行議價限價制度，所有歷次核定調整之標準價格，均係分別地區根據當地棉農生產成本，商販運繳費用，以及市場供需狀况評定。推行以來多數區域咸能遵守，乃近日棉價突起漲風，漢口一地尤爲熾烈，該會據報後，認爲顯係有人從中操縱昨特召集有關方面，詳密研討結果，僉以該會核定之收購價格均有根據。毫厘弛縱，動繁民生，斷不能漫無標準，追逐黑市。况美貸吿成，美援棉花啓運在途，五月中旬即可運到，加以海關無證到埠之外棉，現正次第歸該會收購，配紡需棉無虞匱乏，所有各地棉花集散市塲，，賣價超渝該會核定價格者，各委託收花機構及自購廠商，應即停止收購。該會當即根據上述議決，分別電達紡建公司及嚴令所屬辦事處，六區公會棉商承購聯合辦事處，瑛口承購棉花聯營處等，一體遵照辦理。</p>
<h3>棉紗初期登記　限期現已屆滿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會辦理棉紗登記，所核發之棉紗登記證，有效期限爲三個月，過期無效。凡領有上項登記證者，依規定須於限期內將棉紗用去，並將登記證送會註銷。如逾期查出棉紗仍未用去，得依照棉紗登記辦法第十一條之規定，照非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法予以處分。茲聞初期登記者右效期限已吿届滿，該會對上述未如限繳銷登記證者，將予普查，並依各規定辦理，決不寬容云。</p>

<h3>人絲上升　綢貨下挫</h3>
<p>人迭絲昨市高昂，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤二億五千四百萬元，午收上升至六千六百萬元即期價，下午續吿進展，最大曾做七千七百萬元，結果降爲七千三百萬元，比上日大起一千八百萬元之譜。</p>
<p>廠經昨市上午呈軟，下午回升，終與上日行情相仿。Ｄ字等級五担拆貨價做三億九千五百萬元，下午高零担做四億元，惟交易甚稀。干經市况，亦然平穩。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市上午下降，華强眞絲被面，開市在一億五千七百萬元左右，後即降至六百至十萬元左右盤旋，終因供求失衡，續吿挫跌，收市即期降爲五百廿萬元。大誠格子璧縐，開市做五十四萬元，收市降爲五十三萬五千元，下午原料回升，行情稍堅好。</p>
<h3>紗花布市況仍疲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因月底將届，新買缺乏，四十二支藍鳳細紗初開即小至二億三千萬元。嗣以散戶拉提至二億三千五百萬收束，比之上日回挺二百萬。卅二支藍鳳等因供過於求，軋小一二百萬。廿一支雙馬紗晨開亦跌，中途檯面帮哄抬，終以實銷仍呆，較升一百萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，則互有榮辱</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因消息利賣，又値紡建供售，染廠均呈觀望，長江帮對中檔細布現貨，雖有納胃，但同業及實力派不斷吐售，市呈供過於求。龍頭細布晨開即小至四百九十五萬，嗣以頹勢難挽，再退至八十八萬爲最低價。近收時回上至四百九十萬元結束，較上日步降八萬元。其餘各細布及嗶嘰直貢細斜等，亦均軋小，自五萬至十萬元不一。惟色布及士林布市仍堅穩。</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况脚地軟弱，喊價步降。買方開價稍予提高，交易轉旺。涇陽細絨做開送公庫價爲二五〇〇萬，東溝二一五〇萬至二一九〇萬，海提尖二〇五〇萬，哪北二一〇〇萬，火機二〇〇〇萬，姚花一五八〇萬，周浦籽花五〇〇萬至五〇八萬。</p>
<h3>碧螺春市氣略旺</h3>
<p>每斤開一百三十萬元</p>
<p>洞庭山所產之碧螺春，亦屬名貴之內銷茶，本年度新貨，雖蒞滬多日，但吐納各自堅持，過程岑寂。延至昨市，雙方態度稍轉遷就，遂獲得正式開盤，每斤爲一百三十萬元，市氣頗稱小康。餘如溫州新炒靑及湖州桑芽，均在平穩中開做。惟到源連綿不斷，身骨漸趨蒼老之新龍井，脚地依然不支，臨收結果，比前續吿猛挫。至於存底將罄之陳茶，潛勢俏利如昔，且祁門花香與茶末，因本街力吸，行情飛晋。此外洋莊茶市，進出相埒，起伏殊爲狹隘。</p>
<h3>食米去路呆滯　粉油雜糧疲軟</h3>
<p>米市晨開因產價回升，執主心思甚堅，亟欲喊高價格，惟因去路　木，雖高而不去，於是欲升又止。後市仍見回平，收市更呈疲軟。南市塲早稻等反見修落五萬元，碾秈中關貨小十萬，其餘大抵平定。北市塲亦平中帶疲，特高粳降五萬，爲四百十五萬元。昨日到貨較增，南北二市共計八千〇六十七石。</p>
<p>麺粉　上落陜隘，交易淸淡，市勢開市疲而後市堅，結果略較上日爲秀。兵船粉收市站原價，老車開低後回，收市高於上日萬元。鈇皮跌入八十萬內，計降二三萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧　疲軟乏神，黃豆客銷依然沉寂，本街納取極微。乍豆終見回落五萬元，苞米略見低下，惟中關貨尙定。紅糧轉降，菉豆平定，揀靑略堅，芝蔴到貨稀少略挺，生仁高貨略挫五萬，中次貨平定。</p>
<p>食油　再降，本街銷路懈淡，客帮無問津，在糧市全面不振下，人心疲頹不堪，價乃下降，大統等廠開出豆油，回籠貨更見充斥，最低同豐豆油八百四十五萬元，計跌十五萬左右，生油尙平，獨小軍蔴油升二十萬元。豆餅市轉活潑，價升五千至萬元。</p>

<p>承金華豐先生的慷慨捐助，我們並沒有感到經費的困難，但是在這物價動盪不定的時期，我們預卜貧婦助產運動的前途，一定還是困難重重的。幾個月來，金先生給予了我們全力的支助，使這項善舉能够順利的展開，爲了對金先生負責，和對無數貧婦加强服務起見，我們，作爲助產運動的策動者，必須加倍的奮勉，和不斷的策勵自己，一方面檢討過去的缺點，作爲未來的借鑑·古語說：「前事不忘，後事之師·」就是這個意思。最後，更希望熱心的讀者，不斷的予我們以指示，鼓勵和援助，所謂集思廣益，集腋成裘，假使「貧婦助產」能够得到讀者的熱烈援助，它的前途，一定是光明燦爛的！</p>

<h3>全運會揭幕日　足籃球賽節目　上下午排定比賽八塲</h3>
<p>七届全運大會即將於五月五日在滬揭幕，全部節目秩序，正在編配組加緊編製中，日內即可公佈發表。茲據記者探悉：因參加球隊過多，比賽塲數擁擠，大會揭幕之第一日，除開幕典禮於下午三時，在田徑塲舉行外，運動項目上午九時起，有足球四塲，下午五時半一塲，分別在逸園球場，滬江大學球塲，及田徑塲內足球塲三處演出，下午五時起，則有籃球賽三塲，在大運動塲室外球塲舉行。</p>
<p>昨是抵滬之貴州代表團　（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>全運花絮　田徑老將郝春德戮力教練　梁兆安預測男女游泳錦標</h3>
<p>〔本報特導〕通體育塲的幾條幹路，水電路，　　邁路等，工務局通日正開足全工趕修。一路上多的是小工，石子堆，瀝靑爐，壓車，幾條已修竣的道路，寬闊平坦，汽車在上面疾駛，頗有溜冰的味兒。</p>
<p>體育塲被熾的缺口處，全部搭好路牌廣吿，遮掩起來，粗看還勉强僞裝得過。各處裝修，因爲電路業已接通，都已進入最後階段。據說記者席設在司令台正對面的看台上，下午節目全盛時期，恰巧面向西天烈日，視綫將大受影響。</p>
<p>下午三點鐘光景，上海市的若干男女健兒，正開始在塲上練習，在人　裏，碰到田徑沙塲老將　春德，雄姿依舊，背心短褲，穿了跑鞋，正在督導上海代表練習。問他這次參加什麽項目？他笑笑歉虛地說：應該驤大家玩玩了，所以我這次沒參加競賽，不過担任了上海代表隊的田徑敎練。原來他現在正忙着經營進出。貿易。</p>
<p>八年抗戰，接連下來幾年的烽火，田徑運動在上海也陷入了低潮，令人懷疑起上海田徑隊，是否仍能像六届全運時期的叱咤風雲，果然奪得錦標歸？郝先生却仍很樂觀，他隨便舉幾個例，像樓文敖的萬米，女子短跑，接力，跳高等項目，都是上海隊得分之鑰。</p>
<p>田徑賽名裁判沈昆南昨天也在塲。他說起田徑賽沒落的原因，實還是基於生活不安定。學校正是培植健兒的溫床，可是這年頭，開一圈起碼的跑道，動輙數億。又有那幾個學校，談得上運動健康設備？田徑又怎得不沒落？</p>
<p>跑出體育堪，適與排球名導師陳　德相值。照他觀測，這次男排球錦樣，將成爲粵港大爭奪的對象，女子排球，或許將有上海，台灣，和粵　等厮殺一番。他對台灣女子排球，估價不低。她們打的是日本式排球，與國內一般採用的國際式，稍有不同，複決賽階段，定有精彩鏡頭演出。</p>
<p>體育館的地板，正在用電磨機沙打，聽說明天可以完工。地板的內圈，用桃木敷設，外圈用的是杉不。沙光上瞳後，一息十年的體育館，又將成各地藍球隊馳騁的好塲所了。</p>
<p>游泳池亦已裝修工竣，現在正加工洗刷池身，大槪在四五號左右，可以放水，放滿一池水，須廿四小時。池身容水量，達四十二萬加侖。入夜池身兩壁的壁燈，就可重放光明。可惜的是：該池的消毒濾永設備，已被日敵拆走。</p>
<p>在中靑年會碰着游泳界前輩梁兆安，他現在祖任。上海代表隊的游泳指導。照他推測：本届的男女游泳錦標，將歸香港隊包辦。粵穗和馬來的選手，也許可予香港以若干咸脅。說到上海，他說：游泳代表共廿七位，預計可得分的，怕祗有王中成的百公尺仰泳，和溫敬令的五十及百公尺的、自由式泳等兩三項。</p>
<p>水電路上中訓團所讓借的全運選手宿舍，昨天已從尙恥　搬到尙廉　。台灣粵穗新疆等選手，都已搬進住下，一律統間雙疊鋪。有許多房間，正忙着上漆。不知怎的，在那裏穿進穿出，始終沒碰到一個全運會負責管理宿舍的人。有許多選手說：大槪是因爲籌備時期，尙未成熟，所以他們搬進來後，處處須自己照料。今天換了個宿舍，也都是自己七手八脚的搬了才安頓下來的。</p>
<p>西山夕陽，爬滿了中正公園整個運動塲。一羣福建的男女用經隊　正在那裏活躍練習。他們的　敎練，爲記者介紹了幾位傑出的男女選手。女選手陳碧英的百公尺，是十三秒八，跳遠出五米。郭章德陳文笙的低欄，都有十四秒六七的成績。吳淑英的跳高，達一公尺二八五。她們大多是莆田中學的學生，短小精悍，皮膚黑黝黝的。據說去年曾參加過上海和南京的運動會，獲得過優勝的獎狀。</p>
<h3>教部令全國中小學　組織家長會　仿照臺省各校規程辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京廿九日電〕教激部切據台敎育廳呈報台灣省各國民學校，及中等學校「家長會」組織規程，認爲意美法良。特通令全國中小學仿行。該規程要點爲國民學校與中等舉校一律設家長會。家長與校長敎職員爲會員，其任務有五：（一）促進家　敎　與學校敎育之聯繫，（二）提供學校敎學及兒童辛編各種設施　進意見；（三）協助學校實　敎育計劃；（四）爲學校建設備等經費之籌措；（五）其他關於學校敎育之改進事項。該會於「開學前」及「學期終了後」，各關會一次，必要時開臨時會。</p>
<h3>部令各大學收容　因戰事轉學學生</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕敎部　有原校受剿匪戰事影響，無法返校上課，分赴各地請求轉學之專科以上學生，爲數日衆，爲救濟失學，通令國立各大學，應念戡亂時期特殊情形，對是項學生申請入學者，應於核驗證件後，審查實情，儘量收錄寄讀。俟交通恢復，並於學期結束後，再令回原校肄業。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市新中國法商學院敎授陳仲達，林拯民，蔣壽同，兪振眉，任道遠，楊彥良等三十餘人，於前日下午五時，假新生活俱樂部招待記者，據稱：該院於三月開學，分在平凉路及北京西路一二兩院上課，迄今已達兩月，而敎授薪水，未發分文。乃院長盧錫榮近迫使敎務長蔣載華離校，未得敎授同意，任意更改授課時間，致時間衝突，敎授無法分身；且敎授未能到院授課時，即擅行請人代理。又：該院新訂服務規程，企圖隨時解聘敎授。該敎授等表示決難承認云。</p>
<h3>國立幼師要求　收回撤銷成命</h3>
<p>〔上海社訊〕國立幼稚師範專科學校，頃奉部令，予以撤銷，與市立女子師範合併改爲市立。該校師生，以曾全力扶植該校，且組設民衆夜校，托兒所，大塲服務隊等，成績卓絕，而敎部竟遽予撤銷，影響非淺，頃經師生聯席會議決定，組織「師生護校會」，向各界呼籲，並要求敎部收回成命。</p>

<h3>英各中學擬實施　自由考試制度</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿九日電〕英國敎育部長今日穴布：今後三年中，英國各中學校將實施一種新計劃，所有學生俱可隨意選擇畢業考試之學科。現有之考試制度即將停止，而代以新畢業考試。此種考題將分成三種標準：一爲「普通」級，即等於目前之學校畢業考試標準；一爲「高等」級，程度較前爲高。另有「新學力標準」級，則使天資過人之兒童得以充分發展，而可進一步受高等敎育。新考試制係公開性質，凡各校男女兒童與自修學生俱可參加。敎育部長指稱，此種新制度不可視爲固定者，應隨時予以修改與適應。若干職業團體已表示願與當局合作云。</p>

<h3>綱球賽運獲錦標　檀島華僑選手　李棣華等三人抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕檀香山華僑參加全運會代表李棣華·梅結林·錢潤山三人，於昨下午三時四十五分，乘空中霸王號機，自港抵滬，當即赴揚子飯店下榻·三人中，李氏係領隊，梅錢兩人參加單雙打網球賽。李氏等一行，於四月廿四日離檀飛港。留港三日，曾與徐煒培·士烈近兩人舉行網球雙打友誼賽，結果各收一盤言和。</p>
<p>據李氏語記者：檀島華僑參加全運會，尙係首次。擬借此機會，促進海外僑胞與祖國之聯繫。李氏係太平洋機器公司經理，此次係自費來滬。梅氏在珍珠港經營木業，現年卅一歲。錢氏係亞力山大包爾溫保險公司職員，現年卅五歲。兩人對網球均有廿年以上之經驗。錢氏與貝罕合作之雙打，自一九四四年起，迄去年爲止，每年均得檀香山網球公開賽錦標，實力雄厚。此次來華，對網球錦標，極有問鼎之意。據李氏稱：梅錢兩氏來滬，經費係由檀島僑商領袖籌募。至來滬後之費用，擬請由政府津貼。渠稱：若非經費所限，此次檀島將有籃球·棒球·游泳等代表參加。政府若能津貼，當能增加僑胞返國參加全運之興趣。又聞李氏等將於今日遷往百樂門飯店暫住，直至全運會閉幕云。</p>

<h3>病家對醫生的態度</h3>
<p>— 裘景舟</p>
<p>翻開谷地的報紙和各種雜誌看看，不時有關於我們做醫生的新聞，文章，可以窺知病人和醫生之間，除了「官司年年有」以外，不愉快的事情正多，即使不引起糾紛，也是熱諷冷嘲的，挨駡得够了。</p>
<p>你知道挨駡第一個最多的原因，是什麼？是收錢！醫生和醫院要收錢，簡直是罪過，是作孽。有一張新出的國產電影片「八千里路雲和月」，着末幾幕的情景是劇中女主角做產，因無錢繳費，被醫院拒絕。報載中華醫學會爲此呈請上海市社會局轉令影業公司，以後不得攝取類似的鏡頭，理由是有損醫界信譽。有人看了這消息，不以爲然，大加批評說。</p>
<p>一本來醫院是治病救命的地方，同時也是一種慈善性質的機構，不能如其他普通的辦事機關一樣，遇事必須刻板的講求規定手續，更不能像商店一樣，必先付錢而後交貨。原因是病人的時間，在生與死的交又上，往往是間不容髮的，錯過幾分鐘，就可能使一個本來能够醫治的病人，弄得無藥可救的。難產如此，急診亦然。所以一個醫師，站在人道主義的立塲，當然也不忍讓病人多受時間上遲緩的痛苦，甚至眼見着一個可以醫治的人死去的，理宜本父母之心，不顧一切，首先救人要緊</p>
<p>然而事實却不盡然，有許多私人醫院，甚至於公立醫院，也有不能例外的，往往帶着濃厚的商業意味，開口便是錢，似乎治療成了一種求財的手段，如果遇到了難產或急病，公立醫院得按照規矩，以掛號的先後，以定次序，否則，對不起，你就得拿出加倍的特別掛號費，而且也不一定能够馬上治療。至於一般私人醫院呢！甚至乘他人之危，而不免帶點詐索恐嚇的，也屬常見的事。他們似乎認爲死的是病人，急的是病人的眷屬，都與醫院無關。沒有錢，就是一個辦不到，死也祗好讓病人死了。……抗戰時期，沈浮著「重慶二十四小時」（劇本），也有一偭牛醫師對生產的窮公務員太太，硬要先付款後動手。如果說文藝作品，還能反映一點現實的話，可見這個社會裏是有這種現象存在的，就不能說不應該暴露這種罪惡的行爲』（見三七·三·二九·工商新聞週刊第七十四期六二七頁）。</p>
<p>我倒並不想一口否認，而且同道之中，也有很坦白的加以揭發和糾正了（例如汪黃瑛：醫事手册自序）。何况十步之內，必有芳草；十室之內，必有忠信。像「歲寒圖」（陳白塵著）和「蛻變」（曹禺著）裏所描寫的丁大夫那樣好醫生，却也並不會少。這些人就挨罵不着。雖然他們的名字，也是「醫生」，然而他們的行事，可以俯仰無作。</p>
<p>其實「駡」又有些什麽用？人類的利害觀念，不能和道德觀念，相提並論。凡是利慾薰心的人，即使你怎樣拿「道德」拿「仁義」來責備他們，也是無動於中的。「錢」的確是一種厲階，最好使病人和醫生之間，不要有銀錢這關係纔好。</p>
<p>說到這裏，有位朋友打岔說：這怎麽能够呢？人與人之間，完全是一種經濟關係。醫生替病人治病，病人給醫生診金，並沒有什麼不對。從前韓非子有幾句話說得好：「醫者吮人之傷，食人之血，非骨肉之親也，利之所加也。（見五蠹篇）」。做醫生的，旣然以醫爲業，也就等於說醫生要依賴診病來維持他們自己的生活。有錢的人，一天化整千整萬，眞無所謂，他們也不會來駡你的。不過沒錢的人，你們要放寬尺度就是。</p>
<p>我接着說：問題就在乎有錢的人是少數，沒錢的人，畢竟太多呀！不管你宅心仁厚，眞誠爲病人服務，你要收錢，你就搞不好。譬如說：現在二十萬單位的靑黴素，每瓶市價一百六十萬元（本年三月十五日寗波市價），連蒸溜水加手續費，一槪在內，你祗收費二百萬元，總算是厚道得不顧自己死活了，可是一般病家，還是負祖不起。有名的洪深敎授這樣訴苦說：</p>
<p>我的三歲半的幼子，得一怪病。病了一個多月，從上月十三日開始住醫院。雖經諸醫師悉心診治，至今未見起色—雖然每天注射Streptomycin以及其他針藥，每天須費六十萬元左右，無一定把握——我在市立劇校代課的收入，每月一百二十萬餘元，寫稿的收入，每月亦一百萬餘元。合起來，祗可够買五天的針藥……（三六。九。十一，大公報戱劇與電影第四七期編後記）。</p>
<p>文化人的生活淸苦，世所共見。我眞不忍向他們收錢。又如這裏武嶺醫院的收費和寗波各醫院相差懸殊。住院病人每日十二萬元（自本年四月份起調整，當地米價每石四四〇萬），可以說算作伙食費都不够本，邊論其他醫藥費，房金；但如一個貧苦的農民，患着慢性外科病，必須長期住院治療的話，一個月要三百六十萬元，二個月要七百二十萬元，這個數字，也是多數人聽到會搖頭的。</p>
<p>所以我很希望人民的身體有了創傷時，不要再有荷包的創傷（意即人民有病，可得免費診治）。我們的生活，則由國家負責，並有切實的保障。這樣病人和醫生之間，確實可以消弭不少不愉快的氣氛。我總覺得：我們做醫生的，爲病人操心效勞，有時會半夜三更被喊醒從溫暖的被窩裏起來，冒着風寒雨雪，或而在驕陽底下，張着傘子，趕上十里二十里的荒野路去醫治病人，爲的是什麽？爲的是想挽救那些瀕於死亡綫上的性命呀！這正所以表顯我們醫生至高無上的精神和職業的美德，我們眞不應該讓病人送錢來汚損了我們的這種精神和美德！</p>
<p>然而可恨的是述年戰爭無休止，政治無能，經濟恐慌，好人難以做人。眼前的例子，有如南開大學的校醫李廷光先生月薪九百萬元，無以養八口之家，憤而自殺（本年四月十五日大公報論）。世事如此，除了準備去挨駡者之外，又怎能安心做得成醫生？</p>
<p>還有我在「醫病糾紛」裏說到病家好訟的風氣日盛，這却連得好醫生都免不了以進官裏去的。翻開我去年七月一日的日記，有如下的幾句話經載上海國泰百貨公司營業部主任柯培耀之妻女，控告醫師郭至總過失致人於死一案，附帶民訴，要求總數達四億一千六百八十四萬元，幸得宣吿無罪，否則，罪案如果成立，不要說現世一代，要破家蕩產，就是來生三世，替他做牛做馬都償付不淸了」。</p>
<p>放眼看看，病家對待我們醫生的冷酷，怎又不敎我們做醫生的寒心而灰心呢！</p>
<p>（三七·四·廿四於奉化一漢口）</p>
<h3>雙青樓　談醫隨筆</h3>
<p>（三）做醫生的苦悶</p>
<p>晚飯後無事的時候我的小孩子海龍海珊總要求我議些故事給他們聽。這個講故事的工作雖然是做父親的職責，可是也是一種苦差使。老實說一句，我常常爲着這個差使而發急呢。昨天晚上我拿了一部夏丐尊翻譯的「愛的敎育」來翻翻看，想找些材料去講給小孩們聽。翻來翻去，結果翻到了關於「醫生」的一段。我讀了之後非常地感動，現在節錄數段如下：</p>
<p>你能犧牲了自己的快樂，至於一小時都不得安閒嗎？你能對於無知無識的病人所講出的無禮的言論不動氣嗎？你能持續你救人痛苦的熱心不怕麻煩嗎？用得着你的時候，被人尊敬；到了用你不着的時候，就誰也不再來理睬你；能你不厭倦於這樣的職業嗎？……」</p>
<p>一在爲醫生以前，要切解屍體，解剖腐具的內臟，還要目擊人類的悲慘絕望的光景，耳聞凄苦的呻吟。」「出了醫校之後，要成醫學博士，還須加上多方的努力，並且往往毫無所得地繼續作長時期的研究。」「即使成了醫學博士，也不見得就有好飯喫。」「醫生宛如奴隸或傭僕，遇有出診，不論在嚴冬的深夜或炎暑的夏日，都非前往不可。」</p>
<p>「富者要批評說診病不周到，貧者要怨恨說敲竹槓。勞苦到年，也只得僥倖勉瞿可以不　欠而已。」</p>
<p>「醫生想要過着裕如的生活，先須忍附許多年月。如果在這時期內，一不小心，醫錯了病，就要被破壞名譽至於無人請敎。非換了碼頭，再去從新受苦耐守不可。」</p>
<p>「待到你替許多貧苦的病人治好了病，逐漸把你的信用傳播到富有者耳中的時候，別的新醫生又來附近開業，和你搶生意了。醫生真不是好做的職業。</p>
<p>我們讀了上面這幾段關於醫生方面的文字以後，當然就會有一種共同的感想；即是「做醫生」這個職業眞不是普通一般人所能想像的那樣美滿。不單只不是美滿，可以說簡直是不是普通一般人所能忍受的一種苦生活呢。</p>
<p>而且，處在這個亂糟糟的中國，尤其不容做醫生。儘管你是忠誠服務，問心無愧，倘使你運氣不好的話，碰到了一椿棘手的病症，那末你不單只在名譽方面受着很大的損失，而且還要被人控吿，甚而至於有「吃官司」的可能。新近有幾位同道因爲對於自己的職業太忠實了，結果被人控吿，說是玩忽業務，過失殺人。雖則這些案子已被宣吿無罪，然而當事人在心理上的損失眞是無法可以估計而且也是永遠無法補　的。</p>
<p>唉！誰還要說做醫生的職業是可羨慕的呢？怪不得我的大兒子海曼不願意學醫了。</p>
<h3>肺結核之良藥</h3>
<p>— 徐勁</p>
<p>現在對於結核菌尙無直接的滅菌劑。、一切的療法都係帮助患者加强身體抵抗病菌之力量。至多不過限制結核菌之活動。促使病灶鈣化。就中空氣針還不失爲有效之法。因爲結核菌在體內能自造一層蠟壳。現有之藥物都不能透入此壳而撲殺彼菌。毒性過强者復與人體細胞有礙。是以治療上迄無特效靈藥。</p>
<p>除了注射空氣針以外，普通肺結核患者都已注射鈣針，葡萄糖鈣與維生素D。頃據中華自然科學通訊（中央社南京）：「產生維生素D之化合物ERG，現由芮勃博士試驗肺結症患者，多數於六個月後有顯著之進步。嚴重之結核症患者經檢查後，知核菌大爲减少，或則絕跡。此藥物並非直接滅菌劑，亦非轉化爲維生素D，而發生作用，乃係帮助患者加强身體抵抗病菌之力量，可使早日痊愈。</p>
<p>可知所謂治療新法，還是不脫增强抵抗力這一窠臼。可爲尙無直接滅菌劑之一證。</p>
<p>但有注射無數鈣針而猶無硬化性傾向之肺癆病者。注射空氣針又爲病勢所不可醫者除命其療養以外，往往束手無法。筆者當遇二例，久受鈣針注射無效，改用「愛培撤」而見效。（Ebasal　Bayer）爲拜耳藥廠所出之銅製劑，主治滲出性肺療及滲出性兼空洞性肺癆，尤以治療有硬化性傾向之肺癆爲最佳。此藥共分五種份暈田〇·〇一公分〇，〇二五〇·〇五〇·〇七五至〇·一公分爲止。原爲乾粉劑，用時以蒸溜水調製成溶液，僅限於靜脈注射，每隔二日注射一次，順序按次增加。每一全劑用完，須休息二三個月始再續用，間歇期中仍可注射鈣質針與維生素）。有一年靑患者受一全劑「愛培撤」及鈣針後，飯量大爲增加咳嗽也止。至今經商在台灣，尙不時有信來通候道謝。另有一勞工，由內地隨廠遷移。輾轉來滬，疲勞辛苦，患得肺勞病，且有心職擴大症。胃口大减形容消瘦，久受鈣針治療無效，灰心已極，幾至厭世。筆者試以「愛培撤」治之，並堅囑保持樂觀，少勞動。注射以三全劑，病情大有轉機。至今體力雄健，仍在廠內工作，視悲觀厭世已爲隔代之事。醫師眞正的酬報不在於診金的多寡以及名譽之隆盛而在於完成使命後之衷心的安慰。是以病家感激的微笑，是對醫者最大的鼓勵。（續完）</p>
<p>俊靑按徐君所推薦之「愛培撤」雖屬有效，但其副作用亦甚大，非經專家之手萬勿亂用。否則此藥出世已有多年，何以尙無聲色，無人注意哉。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>利人自利論</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>白永先生前於本刊寫過一　題目叫做「利他，趣味，自私」的文章，其中談到有些中國人把正經的事視同兒戱，把遊戱的事視爲正經；他認爲這種現像以是由於人們看重私利的緣故。這話筆者認爲非但觀察深刻，而且結論亦甚正確。</p>
<p>有些國人對於非常重大的事情往往辦得虎頭蛇尾，沒精打彩，這是何故呢？究其原因，無非那些與他們個人並無切身利害關係罷了，所以事件雖然重大，也就馬虎了事。如果事關私人金錢的進出，幹來就必定劍拔弩張，有聲有色，精神顯得分外的充足。</p>
<p>人們的看重私利，自然也是人之常情；捨身飼虎的人在歷史上本來少見，一人但求做到不損人的地步，也就算不錯了·只是利己以至於過份，却往往不能達到私心所預期的目的，倒會產生與預期相反的效果，有如孔子所謂「欲速則不達」者。舉例以明之。比方我國無綫電里所傳播的廣吿，其目的自然是求商品的推銷，贏利的增加，可是無機電的聽衆們大都知道依現行的那種廣吿術，非但不足以招徠顧客，有時反而會使聽衆憎惡廣吿里所讚揚的一商品。我們要知道人們之開聽無綫電，目的大都在於娛樂，不一是收聽廣告；而今日電台的播音員往往把十廿種商品的廣吿併在一起報吿，如和尙念經似的接迎讀上十廿分鐘，其間不時還隔雜些「阿是残」「本台電話是若干號」一，或是「某公館注意」「某先生注意」，竟還有揚言聽衆今日不去購買某種商品，明日即將漲價者。別的聽衆聽了起何感想，不得而知，在筆者個人言，總覺廣吿做到如此地步，未免有一些俗諺所謂「窮凶極惡」，好到太甚，心頭不免時起反感，暗暗下了決心：即使要買某類商品，也決不願選購廣吿里所宣傳的貨色。依我的猜想，無綫電聽衆之中與我有同感的人們當也不在少數吧。此即好到太過反而不能達到目的之一例。</p>
<p>反之，西人在無綫電中所傳播的廣吿，大都簡單明確，三言二語即行了事，接下去即行繼續娛樂節目，令人聽了覺得乾凈大方。美國有些公司商號對於自己的出品非但不採自稱自讚的方法，而且要進一步，主張說老實話；例如某肥皂廠對於自已出品的肥皂只說：肥皂只是肥皂，本牌肥皂並沒有比別種牌子的肥皂有什麽超異之處。又如好萊塢的「農人市塲」曾於廣吿中說：「今日本市塲的番茄，貨色不佳，即喂猪也覺太壞，最好請等明天再來購買。」這樣的廣吿往往會在人們的腦海中留下良好的印像，反足以推廣貨品的銷路。</p>
<p>這使我想起於第二次世界大戰中德國柏林電台有一位綽號「好好爵士」的播音員，這位先生是一個出色的時事評論家；他的論調或許含有毒素，可是因爲言語風趣，議論精闢，加以聲調動聽，而且言語之中處處爲聽衆當前的切身利害着想所以即在聯合國的綫電聽衆們也愛收聽「好好爵士」的節目。這是什麽緣故呢？理由很簡單，因爲他的節目，趣味性多於宣傳性，蓋即寓穴傳於娛樂者是。換言之，「好好爵士」乃是以利他的手段以達自利的目的。</p>
<p>人人爭取私利的結果是：私利固然難以爭得，却往往會產生混亂的局面。「各自爲政「一語，一方面是表示大家謀取私利，另一方面便是表示沒有秩序。筆者於此不妨舉一個「即小見大」的例子。本市因爲公共車輛不敷需要，所以乘客往往發生爭先恐後的擁擠現象；爲了大家想爭先的緣故，車門被擁塞住了，形成了亂七八糟的一團，反而不及循序上車那麽來得迅速。</p>
<p>人無論尊卑，若一味自私，決不能獲得人們的擁戴；事無論大小，若於處理之際專爲自己打算，便不會有良好的結果。西人辦事，大都事前有整個之計劃，因爲設想週到，佈置完密，所以專情雖然繁複，辦來却仍是條理非然。考其秘訣，不外辦事的人所注重的是所辦的事，而不是自身的私利，故而能够促成事務的完成。擴而充之，我們於待人接物之際，若能爲對方想一想，必可免去自身許多無謂的煩惱。儒家「以德報怨」之這，耶穌「以愛制恨」之訓，其意固在利人，實亦即是自利也。</p>
<h3>事有湊巧</h3>
<p>— 調鸚</p>
<p>一天，好萊塢居民南里克突然發現自己的汽車已吿失竊，就借乘了一個鄕鄰的汽車去報　，不想在歸家途中，後而來了一輛行駛極速的汽車，把南里克坐的那輛車的後部撞癟了。南里克大怒，心想自己的汽車已經倫掉，借了別人的車竟又出了毛病，回去如何交賬！便怒冲冲地跳下軍來，和後面的那輛車的主人交涉，不想後面那輛車却正就是自己失竊的那一輛！偷車賊正想逃走，南里克豈首放過，總算人贓並獲，將偷車賊送交警察了事。</p>
<p>華府有一位姓麥克金尼絲的婦人，從五層樓的窗口失足掉了下來，不想四層樓的窗外有人掛着一根極堅韌的晒衣繩，她掉到繩上，竟彈進了三層樓的一間浴室—一位男客正在入浴。</p>
<p>法國里華地方，有一人名譚禮爾，運道與那位麥克金尼絲夫人差不多，不過還要希奇。他從七層樓上一直掉下來，掉到將近行人道的水門汀時，下面正好有一部嬰兒坐的小車子，那個母親剛剛把小孩子抱起來，譚禮爾恰巧掉在空車裏—譚禮爾毫無損傷，小孩子也未受任何驚慌，例是那位母親嚇得暈倒，在倒地時跌傷了脚踝骨。</p>
<p>在美國紐傑賽州開姆敦地方，一天忽然有一家人家濃烟密佈，像有火警，救火員趕到之後，找了一個鐘頭才查出了冒烟的地方，原來那家人家簷下有一燕巢，那隻不小心的燕子竟銜了一根沒有熄滅的香烟頭進去。</p>
<p>華盛頓有一鴿子，和上一節紐傑賽的那隻燕子惹了同樣的禍，不過當救火員趕到時，竟已無能爲力，眼看一座公寓房子化爲灰燼。</p>
<h3>龜祭</h3>
<p>— 成仁</p>
<p>龜在熱帶海洋所產者甚多，每次產卵可自百枚至二百之數。巨者常達六呎以上，小者尙不及二吋。其棲於海岸者俗稱海趙，在陸地者則稱睦　。</p>
<p>龜在南洋土人中也被奉爲一種「圖騰」。安達曼·婆羅洲等地對於龜也有祭典的舉行，捕殺也有限制。</p>
<p>安達曼島所舉行的龜祭，係由祭主長老先將一靑年人的皮膚塗以泥土，用芙蓉紮飾髮，樹葉圍腰，便端坐草墊之上，畏老力將昨夜捕來之龜將其肉擬裂成塊置於木盌，放在靑年前面，取肉片蘸油塗在靑年身上，及唇上，此時靑年不許言語，後長老要將肉片使之咽下，其左右的近親並將靑年的身體左右搖動。靑年在該夜徹夜端坐，不許合目假睡，爲不使入睡，由其家人兄弟姊妹等團集周圍，向其講說珍奇異事，靑年爲明曉作壯丁的如識，故也決不入睡。直至第三日方可橫臥，第四日可到海岸將髮及皮膚上的油質洗去，並仍可在海上捕總。</p>
<p>在當日還要請親友舉行大祭，那已爲壯丁之靑年搖動「比加斯」樹，飄散樹葉，里人則擊鼓·拍掌。通宵亂舞，經過此一段儀式後，靑年即被認爲正式壯丁，可以參加　種集會，及與外族鬥爭。</p>

<p>余　華山，曾宿東峯，探衛卿博台，一險也；登南峯，出南大門，下長空棧，探朝元洞，賀祖洞，二險也；登大上方，三官洞，八仙洞，金仙洞，三險也。當時未知其險，以爲蒼龍嶺直平坦大路耳，不知謫仙翁何以膽小如此，眞不可解。</p>
<p>大抵游山，全是一鼓作氣，氣餒則力恭，許多游華者，至回心石即止耳。千尺嶂百尺峽，且不能上，何論乎長空棧與博台乎？古人所云濟勝其，不第腰脚爲車，邁往之氣？亦爲主要之一部分。</p>
<p>曩余在東峯時，遇道士吳元噸，以詩相質，寫二詩答之。一云，朝陽峯頂大風狂，遠道來登興倍長，我願一斟仙　露，百千萬歲飽瓊漿（朝陽峯即東峯，上有仙人掌）。鐵碁盤在鐵亭中，攀險縋幽等　空，世界原如碁一刦，投壺天笑破鴻濛。留與紀念，未知今尙存焉否耳。</p>
<p>長空棧之高度，計上下九里（據道士言）。是年春初，一燒香客墮落，覓之，三日始得骸？落地已非華陰縣轄，但按之鐵鍊及木板，均甚堅固，不易摧折，茍非失足，斷不至葬身荒漠。其間遲靜處（又名賀老石室），確爲極好之修練塲，意志堅定者，如仙人郝太古等輩，打坐於此，自有相當贊助。至選勝探奇人，一經到達，絕不留戀，純係過眼雲烟，不生若何關係也。</p>
<p>西峯又名蓮花峯，道士劉雲霞，索寫聯，余爲寫「萬山環翌天　秀，九馭騰雲道證仙」句，留作紀念。旁有陳道士爲余</p>
<h3>茉莉</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>春序漸深，茉莉上市。此花淸麗不大，而馥郁芬芳，最宜於婦人壓鬢助妝之用。李漁　情偶寄中云：「茉莉一花，單爲助妝而設，其天生以媚婦人者乎？是花皆曉開，此獨暮開，暮開者，使人不得把玩，秘之以待曉妝者也。是花蒂上皆無孔，此獨有孔，有孔者，非此不能受警，天生以爲立脚之地也。若是，婦人之粧，乃天造地設之事耳。植他樹皆爲男子，種此花獨爲婦人；旣爲婦人，則當眷屬視之矣。妻梅者止一林逋，妻茉莉者，當遍天下而是也。」</p>
<p>笠翁此論，殊爲淸雋，在以男性為社會中心的時代，「種此花獨爲婦人」，實在難得之至！是茉莉可謂婦人之功臣。但繼則曰：「旣爲婦人，則當眷屬視之矣。」落葉歸根，是茉莉仍爲男人設也。</p>
<p>又浮生六記中亦有一段關於茉莉的有趣記載：「……蕓已笑倒余懷，不能成聲矣，覺其鬢邊茉莉濃香撲鼻，因拍其背以他詞解之曰：「想古人以茉莉形色如珠，故供助妝壓鬢，不知此花必沾油頭粉面之氣，其香更可愛，所供佛手當退三舍矣。」蕓乃止笑曰：「佛手乃香中君子，只在有意無意間；茉莉是香中小人，故須借人少勢，其香也如脅肩諂笑。」余曰：「卿何遠君子而近小人？』芸曰：『我笑君子愛小人耳。』」</p>
<p>茉莉一上美女之頭，其香更爲可愛，是其可愛者不全在苿莉之香，而此中有美女之成份在焉故也。花與美人，相得益彰，三白芸娘君子小人之論，未免近俗，惟其閨房淸福，固令人爲之艷羨不置也。</p>
<p>按茉莉一名抹利，東坡名曰暗麝，其香氣濃烈可知。釋名　華，原出波斯國，今多生於南方之地。北名奈木水者出閩廣，幹粗莖勁，高僅三四尺；藤本者出江南，弱莖叢生，有長至丈者。葉似茶而微大，花有單瓣重瓣之異。一種寶珠茉莉花似小荷而品最貴，初蕊時如珠，每至暮始放，香滿一室，摘去嫰枝，使枝再發，則枝益繁而花益密矣。言，西峯背後，一洞名黑風，上下峭壁，無路可入，華陰人黃子陽（名光曜）好奇，以長繩絡巨筐，坐其中，由峯頂縋下，抵洞門入之，執炬行一日餘，見奇服者數人，詢黃何來，以何事至此。黃以求道對，皆嘉其有志氣，與語數日，乃授以一書。黃携出，秘不爲人知，日夜研究，得窺門徑，一日臥床未醒，爲人所見，火忽發於書，焚燬無餘，黃遂神魂顚倒，久之，益復迷惘，乃出家爲通士。數月後，又復返家。稍覺淸醒，以其心得，敎導弟子，著有理氣源流一書，印行在外。余即託陳道士覓此書，迄未得見，究竟所言虛實如何，殆未之能決也。</p>
<p>郝太古在華山聲洞，見之七眞傳小說中，然華山固亦有郝祖洞，余未能躋登，一探究竟。華山除中峯（即玉女峯）外，四峯皆奇，挺立如　花，遙望之，白雲銷其腰，類束帶然。下山時，有一詩云：「層雲靄靄影沈沈，太古蓮花繫我心，飽看奇山五十里，一篷晴日別遙岑」。</p>

<h3>青雷學圖</h3>
<p>前寫「金山寺」一段談薈，（已於二十二日刊出）復又讀本報廣吿版寺僧太滄關於該寺募捐及復建各節之聲明文內「金山江天寺」數字，始憶及「金山寺」並非此寺之正名。「金山」是山名（實際亦只大江中一個小島嶼），寺在山，而山固非寺，自應別有寺名，「江大寺」之名，亦非不知，「江大一覽」之御碑故事，前登拙文，亦已敍及。然若非讀太滄之文，則忘却久矣。實因「金山寺」之稱，流傳已久而溥，不但戱曲小說如此，科名時代之文人，亦且引爲典賽。淸光緖十一年乙酉科，浙江正主考爲白桓，副主考爲潘衍桐，有落第士子就白潘二姓製爲諧聯曰：「金山寺斗踢文魁，難逃覆鉢」；「紫石街簾挑武嫂，密約裁衣」。屬對極工，字字配合穩治，亦以「金山寺」爲寺名。想此作者受戱塲印象之影響甚深，上聯有「水漫」「斷橋」「產十」「合鉢」，下聯則「挑釁」「栽衣」，舊都伶人小翠花常演之。「紫石街」見於水滸傳中，今山東陽毅縣有無此街，則不可考矣。</p>
<p>二十五日第一版載「副總統選舉複賽」長篇特紀文中，極多雋語。一位女代表問一位翁先生　「你的良心投誰一票？」翁代表笑而答之曰：「我投良心一票。」只將字樣略爲換位，便是雙關之好詞，應對敏活，可稱突梯滑稽之Wit妙才矣。此公所投之票上，果能以「良心」爲人名而寫出乎？按戱劇中「良心」指證之詞甚多，如「寶蓮燈」盤訊二子一塲，劉延昌問夫人王桂英：「你來看，這上？」夫人答：「靑大。」劉再問：「下？」再答：「敷土。」再問：「你我爲父母者」」再答：「憑的是良心二字！」又如「一捧雪」審頭一塲，陸炳問湯勤：「你來看這上？「湯勤答：「靑天。」再問：「下？」再答：「敷土。」再問：「你我居官者？」（「居官人？」）再答：「憑的是良心二字。」再問：「一個人若是無有良心？」湯勤略為　頓，答「敎大狗吃了他們！」（後多一問答，乃因劇情而變幻，而身段眼神手法亦異，須實地在塲上體驗，自知其妙。今不繁敍。）吾想此兩位代表亦可仿照以上兩例，女代表問：「你來看這上？」（說時須以手上指。）翁代表答；「靑大。」（答時須舉目上看。）再問：「這下？」（須隨說隨即以手指地·）再答；「敷土。」再問：「你我投票者？」再答：「憑的是良心二字。」若再問：「一個人若是無有良心？」則以下應作何答語，應視各人的情境而變換，不能執一以求。</p>

<h3>The Fourth Vote Result of the National Assembly: Li Zongren Elected as Vice President to Assist the Head of State in Reforming Politics to Accomplish the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction; Li Hopes Public Opinion Will Exert Democratic Power</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The National Assembly held its fourth vice-presidential election assembly on the morning of the 29th. As a result, Li Zongren was elected as the first vice president of the Republic of China under the Constitution with a larger majority of 1,438 votes. The citizens of the capital were as concerned as ever. From the beginning of the voting, they gathered in front of radio broadcasting machines to listen to the entire election process, calculating the ebb and flow of the votes of the two candidates with tense hearts. Finally, upon hearing that the first vice president had been legally produced, they cheered loudly, national flags fluttered all over the streets, firecrackers could be heard everywhere, and they joyfully celebrated the completion of the final task of this National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Li Zongren issued a written statement on the 29th after being elected as Vice President, saying: "I am deeply grateful for the strong support of all representatives and the enthusiastic support of people across the country for my election as the first Vice President. The smooth progress of this conference is truly due to the deep understanding of the significance of constitutional government by the people of the country and the spiritual appeal of Chairman Chiang. After being elected, I will naturally adhere to my consistent advocacy, assist the Head of State, reform the administration, and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance and supervision at any time so that I can live up to their trust. All the gentlemen who participated in this election are highly respected and admired by the people of the country. Although they were not elected, I firmly believe that after the establishment of the new government, their sincerity in serving the country and their responsibility to share the difficulties will be no less than my own."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] When Li Zongren was in Anle Hall, he gave a speech at the request of reporters, saying: "I am very grateful and very excited that this election has achieved final success. This victory is not only my personal victory, but also the victory of all the representatives. From now on, I am determined to assist the President with sincerity, be loyal to the country, and serve the nation." When Mr. Li returned to his residence, dozens of Chinese and foreign reporters gathered at his residence, all asking Mr. Li to give a speech. Mr. Li replied to the reporters: "From now on, I am determined to absolutely obey the President and walk the same path as the President. Now is a time of suppression of rebellion, and only suppression of rebellion can save the lives of the people." When a reporter asked when he would return to Peiping and whether he would continue to serve as the director of the Parallel Headquarters, Li replied: "It needs to be decided after I pay my respects to Chairman Chiang for instructions."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The Li Zongren Election Committee held a press reception at 8:00 PM on the 29th and invited Mr. and Mrs. Li and Bai Chongxi to attend. In his speech, Mr. Li mentioned that although there were minor setbacks during the election process, they were finally calmed down, and good order was maintained in the midst of tension, so that the meeting could proceed smoothly. He said: "Now that I have been elected, I am determined to assist President Chiang and pay more attention to the welfare of the grassroots of society." He emphasized that politics needs change, and change leads to progress. If politics can be effectively reformed, there will be no problem with suppressing the rebellion. This is the unanimous expectation and confidence of the people of the country. He is willing to assist President Chiang in this effort, and believes that President Chiang will have bold actions in expanding the political base and attracting talents from all over the country. From then on, following the rule of law, clarifying political ethics, and strictly enforcing official discipline will lead to international sympathy and public confidence. The future of suppressing rebellion and building the country will surely be brighter, and success can be achieved sooner." He hoped that the public opinion circle would exert the invincible democratic power, and be the sensitive and correct ears and eyes for the people, so that the public opinion circle's reports would clarify right and wrong, so as to enhance the democratic foundation. Mrs. Li Zongren, Guo Dejie, was exhausted for days, and her voice was lost, so she only made a simple speech. Bai Chongxi also delivered a speech saying: "The victory of Director Li is a victory of democracy. From now on, the people of the country will exert greater democratic power and work together to suppress the rebellion." Then the reporters asked Mr. Li to frequently announce the good news of assisting President Chiang in carrying out political reforms to the people. Finally, Mr. and Mrs. Li were lifted up for photographs again, and the event ended happily at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Process of Voting and Counting Votes in the Fourth Election</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The National Assembly's fourth vice-presidential election meeting began at 9:37 AM on the 29th. Chairman Yu Bin first had Secretary-General Hong read the Chairman's report, and then Chairman Yu answered two inquiries. Regarding the establishment of the Committee for the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction, it had been approved by the State Council of the National Government, but the person in charge had not yet been determined. As for the problem of invalid votes, Secretary-General Hong was asked to report. At that time, Representative Jia Guoen also made two suggestions: one was that the problem of identifying questionable votes should be solved simultaneously for each ballot box, so as to avoid concentrating the final identification of valid votes, which would affect emotions and order; and the other was that Chairman Yu Bin should participate in the inspection of the ballots to show solemnity. Secretary-General Hong reported that the Secretariat and Chairman Yu had adopted Jia's two suggestions, and then read out the criteria for identifying invalid votes as listed in Article 15 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election Voting and Ballot Counting Methods, and explained the precautions for writing and folding ballots in terms of technology for the conference to refer to. At 10:00 AM, the voting began. Secretary-General Hong and Chairman Yu, due to inquiries from representatives, reiterated the explanation of the difference between the number of representatives present at the meeting and the number of voters, because the number of people at the meeting was the number of people who attended the routine report, to indicate that there were enough to meet the legal quorum. Representatives who arrived after the meeting could vote before the voting was over, so the number of votes must be more than the number of people who attended the meeting. Yu also pointed out that each representative received a ballot with an attendance certificate, and the number was definitely correct. At 10:16 AM, the ballot reception and voting began. At 11:00 AM, all the attendees had voted. After Yu Bin and Zhao Yushi voted successively at 11:04 AM, Chairman Yu announced the end of the voting and a recess. At 11:18 AM, he announced the continuation of the meeting and the counting of votes. At 11:37 AM, Sun Ke's ballot was read out first. In the tense mood of the attendees, the twelve ballot boxes were opened in succession. The counting of the last two ballot boxes was even more tense, and there was more and more private talk in the representative seats. Before the twelfth ballot box had been opened, the situation of Li Zongren's election had been determined, and the supporters of Sun Ke left one after another. At 1:04 PM, the twelfth ballot box was opened, and cheers rang out in the representative seats. Li Zongren's wife, Guo Dejie, was surrounded by reporters. After a while, Secretary-General Hong reported that 2,766 ballots had been issued, 2,761 ballots had been cast, and excluding 28 invalid ballots, there were 2,733 valid ballots. Finally, Chairman Yu announced: "The results of the fourth vice-presidential election meeting on April 29, 37th year of the Republic of China: (1) Mr. Li Zongren received 1,438 votes, (2) Mr. Sun Ke received 1,295 votes, according to Article 5 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law, the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 3, Item 2 of the same law shall apply: 'Select one of the top two candidates with the most votes in the third round, and the one with the most votes shall be elected.' The voting result today is that Mr. Li Zongren received the most votes and is legally elected as the Vice President of the Republic of China." At 1:05 PM, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

Every time he arrived at a place, he heard the sound of firecrackers, and was surrounded by representatives and others, the situation was warm, which formed a direct proportion to the tense situation of the election in recent days. Mr. Li shook hands with each representative to express his gratitude. He then returned to his residence in Dafang Lane with his wife. At that time, those who went to Mr. Li's residence to offer congratulations were in an endless stream. Yu Bin, Chairman of the 29th Assembly, and Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General, went to offer their greetings before Mr. Li returned. Chen Lifu, a friend of Mr. Li, also arrived after Yu Hong and others, and waited in the reception room for several minutes before meeting Mr. Li after his return to express his congratulations. It is estimated that from the afternoon to the evening, hundreds of people, including Cheng Qian, Du Yuming, and Gan Naiguang, went to Mr. Li's residence to offer congratulations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Li Zongren, accompanied by his wife, went to the Huangpu Road official residence at 3:20 PM on the 29th to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. They talked for about 40 minutes and left at 4:00 PM. He then attended the meeting of the Central Supervisory Committee, returned to his residence at 5:00 PM to rest, and read telegrams of congratulations from all parties. Starting at 5:20 PM, he began to visit the various vice-presidential candidates and friends such as He Yingqin. Mr. and Mrs. Li first visited Yu Youren. Yu raised his thumb high and repeatedly said "Mr. Li is very good". Mrs. Li, Guo Dejie, thanked him repeatedly and humbly said that Mr. Yu cultivated future generations. Three minutes later, Mr. and Mrs. Li visited Sun Ke. Sun happened to be out attending a meeting, and was received by Sun's wife, Chen Shuying. Mr. and Mrs. Li and Chen met with smiling faces, shook hands warmly, and repeatedly said that they should cooperate and help each other in the future. The reception room of Vice President Sun was filled with an atmosphere of harmony and joy for a while. Yesterday's political enemies have now become friends again. When Li resigned, he said that he would come again to wait for Mr. Sun another day. Mr. and Mrs. Li then visited Cheng Qian. Mr. and Mrs. Li shook hands tightly and repeatedly said thank you, thank you, help, help, and talked for about ten minutes. They then said goodbye. Mr. Li also visited Xu Fulin, Mo Dehui and He Yingqin. He felt slightly unwell and met with Mr. and Mrs. Li despite his illness. He looked very happy. After offering his congratulations, He said to Mrs. Li: "You can rest for two days." Mrs. Li replied: "I haven't had a good rest for a month." Li also said: "It has been more than a month since I came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 22nd of last month." There was a feeling of infinite relief in his words. He then took out a Taiwan watermelon given by a friend to entertain the guests. The three of them talked and ate together. Mr. and Mrs. Li, who had been tense and working hard for months, finally had a chance to cool down their hearts at this time. After talking for 30 minutes, Mr. and Mrs. Li bid farewell.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives Prepare to Organize the "National Reconstruction Association"; Recommend Sun Ke as the Leader; Concentrate Efforts to Complete the Task of Suppressing Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Sun Ke has recently been recommended as the leader of the "National Reconstruction Association". The association is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting in Beijing on the 30th to discuss association affairs. The purpose of the association is to promote the spirit of democracy and jointly devote itself to building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. It will broadly solicit members and establish a board of directors and several supervisors. The general association will be located in the capital, and branches will be established in various places.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Sun Ke hosted the National Assembly representatives at Longmen Restaurant at 8:00 PM on the 29th to express his gratitude, and gave a speech on the spot, explaining his attitude towards losing the vice-presidential election. He was not negative or pessimistic, and will work hard to overcome difficulties and forge ahead, so that the Republic of China can embark on a path of prosperity and happiness. Sun first said: "I am very grateful for the sympathy and support of everyone in this election. However, our task is not yet completed. The country is still in great difficulty, and everything needs to be rebuilt. The National Reconstruction Association, which has been proposed to be organized by a number of comrades, should concentrate everyone's efforts to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion." The National Assembly representatives and comrades of this party cannot shirk their responsibility. After Sun's speech, Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Ni Wenya, Zhong Tianxin and many others also delivered speeches, all of whom believed that Sun's candidacy for vice president was regarded as an obligation, and that those who assisted in the election were even more self-motivated, like volunteers. Although Sun did not win the election, his reputation will become more solid and enhanced. Hundreds of National Assembly representatives who attended the meeting today listened to Sun's speech and the speeches of the representatives, and cheered enthusiastically to express their agreement, and the meeting ended at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Gives a Speech to Reporters in a Relaxed Manner</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Sun Ke participated in the vice-presidential election and lost by 143 votes less than Li Zongren after the second round of voting. Sun did not mind this at all and remained extremely calm. When he met with reporters, he still expressed satisfaction with obtaining more than 1,200 votes in his usual relaxed manner. He said: "I am grateful for the encouragement and support of the National Assembly representatives from home and abroad in this vice-presidential election. I received enthusiastic support in the first, second, third, and fourth rounds of voting, and the number of votes I received in the third and fourth rounds exceeded 1,000, which is enough to show the sincerity of the representatives in caring for me. Although I have not been elected, I will never forget the enthusiasm and friendship of the representatives. I cannot but deeply express my gratitude." Sun said: "I am very happy that Mr. Li Zongren received more votes and was elected Vice President, because Mr. Li has made glorious achievements in the past in the party and the country, and I believe that he will be able to assist the Head of State and assist in the construction of democratic politics in the future. This is something I cannot but take special comfort in." Finally, Sun said: "This conference was finally able to complete its sacred mission in an atmosphere of harmony and smoothness. From now on, our country can enter the democratic stage, but we are still in a period of suppressing rebellion. I sincerely hope that we can achieve the goal as soon as possible to establish a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, by the people, of the people, for the people."</p>

<h3>A Chronicle of the National Assembly: Tense and Enthusiastic Talk of the Fourth Election</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "Li Zongren received 1,438 votes and is elected as the first Vice President of the Republic of China." After Yu Bin, the chairman of the fourth Vice Presidential election assembly, announced the election results, most people in the assembly hall applauded enthusiastically. When the final results of the votes were not yet out, and Li Zongren's victory was in sight, Mrs. Guo Dejie, Li's wife, was surrounded by some reporters at the scene. After the results were announced, Mrs. Li was also lifted out of the door by the crowd and photographed, in the cheers, as the esteemed wife of our first Vice President.</p>
<p>The news of Li Zongren's election as Vice President was broadcast to all corners of the country by radio at 1:05 PM. At 1:15 PM, upon exiting the assembly hall, what greeted you on the streets was a burst of firecrackers, only slightly less enthusiastic than when the President was elected.</p>
<p>The election of the Vice President can truly be said to have reached a state of enthusiasm and tension, or, to put it a bit excessively, it almost reached a serious stage. Yesterday's third election resulted in Li Zongren and Sun Ke obtaining the qualifications for the final, but the 515 votes of the defeated Cheng Qian became the basic target of today's final. Last night, both candidates Li and Sun put in a lot of work on these 515 votes. Early this morning, Li Zongren, accompanied by his wife, went to the residences of various representatives to greet them and solicit votes. Sun Ke also sent someone to the Xiaguan Railway Station to welcome representatives who had come specifically from Shanghai to vote. Before the meeting, Li Zongren still stood at the first post at the gate, welcoming each representative, with his wife at the second post. Further inside were Sun Ke and his wife. Sun Ke personally attended the meeting today for the first time, shaking hands to try to win the final vote. Although this was a very obvious vote-seeking strategy, who wasn't wearing a smile? Moreover, Mrs. Li's talent for socializing led her to specifically walk over and shake hands with Mrs. Sun, laughing. In reality, the wives of the two vice-presidential candidates were even more nervous than the two candidates themselves. Some people attributed Cheng Qian's defeat to not bringing his wife to serve as a high-level campaign advisor! Otherwise, the rivalry between the three wives' staff would probably have made the campaign even more lively.</p>
<p>Although the atmosphere in the assembly hall could not be described as very warm and peaceful, this tense atmosphere, like an arrow on the string, had obviously transitioned from the arguing of the previous few days to a battle contained within the heart. Therefore, the fourth round of voting proceeded smoothly. During the voting process, those whispering to each other in the assembly hall were actually placing various novel bets, speculating who the final winner would be. Some said that given Li Zongren's "leading advantage, today's victory should still be his"; others said that most of Cheng Qian's 500-plus votes would be cast for Sun Ke; and that with just one vote difference, he could be elected, and the winner might be Sun Ke. However, opinions varied, and betting is never 100% accurate.</p>
<p>During the voting process, there was a touching little episode: female representative Lin Fanwen fell ill due to campaign work, but today she still dragged her body, unable to walk, in order to cast this sacred and important vote, and temporarily asked the meeting staff to help her cast this vote in person. From this, we can see the enthusiasm of the competition and the seriousness of not giving up a single vote.</p>
<p>After the voting was completed, the most tense ballot counting began at 11:37 AM. In the 2,733 tallies, the ballots were divided into twelve ballot boxes. From the twelve sets of statistics, it could be seen that Li Zongren held a two-thirds lead. Moreover, whether the difference was large or small, the distance between Li's leading numbers and the total was greater, while Sun's difference was limited, so when Li Zongren took the lead, after winning the first three boxes, Sun Ke's votes, although 25 more in the fourth round, were still too far from the total. By the time the vote count reached the sixth box, the difference between the two sides was nearly 200 votes, but then the seventh box was opened, and Sun's votes exceeded Li's by 60, which caused a bit of discussion in the hall, because the vote count was exactly halfway, and if there was a change, Sun Ke might catch up. However, after that, he fell into a slump. By the end of the tenth box, Li had 1,159 and Sun had 1,013, not much different from yesterday's third election results. Sun's campaign team was waiting for the advantage of the last two boxes, but the result was that Sun Ke's total votes in the twelve ballot boxes were 1,295, while Li Zongren's total in the eleventh box was 1,295. The 143 votes Li Zongren received in the twelfth ballot box were the victory votes that determined his election. When Sun Ke's trend had declined at the eleventh ballot box, some representatives had already left their seats, and conversely, the atmosphere in another corner became heated. When the final statistics were announced, cheers erupted from that corner.</p>
<p>The position of Vice President is obviously not comparable to that of the President, but because he went through four rounds of fighting, emotionally speaking, his emergence is more enthusiastic than that of the President. (April 29th, Nanjing)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Announcement of the Vice Presidential Election – Congratulations to General Li Zongren on Being Elected Vice President</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Assembly held the fourth vote for Vice President. The on-the-spot counting of votes resulted in General Li Zongren being elected as the first Vice President after the implementation of the Constitution with a majority of 1,438 votes against 1,295 votes. When the news spread, the people in Beijing and Shanghai were all deeply gratified to have found the right person. They also congratulated the National Assembly on the successful conclusion of its work with a pleasant mood.</p>
<p>According to Article 49 of our Constitution, "When the President is vacant, the Vice President shall succeed to the presidency until the expiration of the President's term." Although the Vice President has no real power in peacetime, he assumes the powers of the President when the President is vacant. Therefore, the position of Vice President is also very important. There were six candidates participating in this election: Li, Sun, Cheng, Yu, Mo, and Xu, all of whom are virtuous and respected veterans of the Party and the country. They were not only able to conform to public opinion and be what people hoped for, but they were also able to be more than competent for the position of Vice President. However, the results of the first and second votes showed that Li and Sun received the most votes, but neither exceeded half, so neither could be elected. Just as the third vote was about to be held, rumors were rampant inside and outside the meeting, and undercurrents were surging. Coupled with the excessive enthusiasm of the campaign teams, which fueled the flames, misunderstandings arose among the three candidates, who successively issued statements expressing their abandonment of the election, almost causing a political storm. Fortunately, the presidium of the National Assembly handled the matter properly. On the one hand, it decided to adjourn the National Assembly for three days to suppress the false alarm on the scene. On the other hand, patriotic people went around running and dredging. In addition to seeking solutions in the law, the supreme principle of free voting was reiterated. In this way, the hostility in the capital was eliminated, the rumors were clarified, the misunderstandings were resolved, and the meeting could be continued on the 28th to hold the third vote. Under the watchful eyes of the people of the whole country, the order of the meeting and the voting situation were well-organized, which shows that the rumors were all baseless. After this storm, the National Assembly has made considerable progress, which can be said to be "failure is the mother of success". The achievements of the National Assembly are especially worthy of our cherishment. Our country's democratic constitutionalism is still in the learning stage, and we should seek progress from learning, and we should cherish the lessons learned from this election.</p>
<p>First, there should be a limit to election propaganda. In theory, all propaganda that is beneficial to oneself and unfavorable to the other party is allowed, but the content of the propaganda should be limited to expounding one's own political views and attacking the other party's inappropriate policies, and it is best to implement a "propaganda truce" when voting; otherwise, both sides will engage in propaganda warfare, which will become more and more intense, with leaflets and slogans flying all over the streets, and newspapers and magazines attacking each other, which will inevitably lead to emotional behavior and cause misunderstandings between the two sides. Elections are the basis of democratic politics, and cultivating a good habit of attack is especially urgently needed in China, which is still in the class of learning democracy.</p>
<p>Second, anonymous secret voting is the best guarantee of free voting. During the election turmoil, although some candidates accused the assembly of manipulating the election, making it impossible for the National Assembly representatives to vote freely, the facts now prove that this accusation is unfounded, because when the representatives voted anonymously, no one was supervising them, and no one was obstructing them. They could vote freely according to their own conscience. The malpractice of bribery with money will certainly not occur; even the use of force to threaten representatives to vote will not have any effect. Therefore, we hope that the government will implement anonymous secret voting in all future elections to guarantee the supreme principle of free voting.</p>
<p>In short, elections have educational significance. After this vice-presidential election, we have gained many valuable lessons, and we should seek progress from these lessons. Therefore, after learning that General Li Zongren has been elected, we hope that General Li will assist the head of state in reforming politics and military affairs with his spirit of dedicating himself to the revolution for more than ten years, and complete the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country as soon as possible. On the other hand, we also wish our people's livelihood constitutionalism to seek progress in learning, and to have a bright and brilliant future!</p>
<h3>The Flames of War in the Middle East Loom</h3>
<p>The war in Palestine, after breaking out in Haifa and Jaffa, has spread like wildfire and is becoming increasingly uncontrollable. On the one hand, the Jews, under the leadership of the radical Irgun, occupied the port of Jaffa on the 28th, directly threatening the holy city of Jerusalem. On the other hand, Arab League countries such as Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt are also preparing to invade Palestine starting on May 1st. In this way, the war in Palestine will also evolve into an international war in the Middle East. The spread and expansion of the Holy Land not only makes the US diplomatic authorities deeply uneasy, but also makes peace-loving people in general have to express their infinite concern about the outbreak of the Middle East powder keg.</p>
<p>Although the Palestinian issue is a religious and ethnic dispute, the conflict between Jews and Arabs has been almost daily since the British mandate of more than 30 years. But if there are no external factors mixed in, the problem is still simple and it is not difficult to find a reasonable solution. Therefore, the deterioration of the Palestinian issue to this point is actually the result of the struggle of power politics. In particular, the policies of Britain and the United States are often hesitant and should bear heavy responsibility. Britain has always adopted a "divide and rule" policy towards Palestine, trying to use the contradictions between the Jews and Arabs to deliberately waver in order to be in an important position. The same is true in the United States. After the end of World War II, the United States' attitude was obviously stiff towards the Jews, advocating the implementation of partition in Palestine and supporting the Zionist movement; but now it advocates trusteeship.</p>
<p>Originally, the Palestinian partition plan was only conducive to the Zionist movement and the solution of the European refugee problem, which would naturally arouse the resentment of the Arab countries in the Middle East. In addition, in fact, whether this partition plan can be realized is also a problem, because the area of Palestine is not large. If it is divided into two countries like India, then neither of these two countries can have the conditions that a modern country should have. Therefore, the United States has to reconsider its attitude. However, what the United States values most is not the difficulty in resolving the Jewish-Arab conflict, but the attitude of the Arab countries. In other words, if the United States insists on its own opinion and insists on implementing partition in the Holy Land, it is very likely to arouse anti-American sentiment among the people of Arab countries. Today's United States is most afraid of Arab countries falling into the arms of the Soviet Union, because the United States invests in the oil business in the Middle East. In terms of equipment alone, it will be nearly 1.6 billion US dollars. If it cannot win the friendship of Arab countries, and there are frequent riots to cut off oil pipelines, then not only will the interests of the United States in the Middle East be hit first, but also the US aid to European reconstruction plan will encounter a major obstacle. Therefore, the Palestinian issue has now become a link in the US-Soviet struggle.</p>
<p>The United Nations Special Session is now discussing how to deal with this issue. Secretary of State Marshall also hopes that the United Nations can promote a truce between Jews and Arabs; however, this issue is difficult to solve clearly in the struggle of power politics. Looking at the situation, the flames of war in the Middle East cannot be extinguished for a while, and there is a danger of spreading and expanding!</p>

<h3>Various Parties Favor Gilbert as the Executor of US Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The executor of the US aid loan to China has recently attracted much attention from all parties. It is heard that Washington has considered Mr. Gilbert, the current counselor of the US Embassy in China and concurrently the head of the China Relief Mission, as a more ideal candidate. This is because Mr. Gilbert understands our country's national conditions, and recently stabilized the fluctuating grain prices with 45 million US dollars of relief supplies. Compared with the achievements of the UNRRA in those years, the differences are obvious. The opinions of relevant people in our country also hope that Mr. Gilbert can serve as the US aid executor, so that he can be familiar with the work and help stabilize our country's economic situation.</p>

The proposal also believes that the above two institutions should be subject to the US State Department and Department of Defense.

Two meals a day were provided, barely enough to survive. The Communist army kept a closer watch on public educators and military personnel. Mr. Chang pointed out that some merchants, eager to be released soon, identified many National Assembly representatives and generals among the passengers to the Communist army, which then regarded them as "Nationalist agents." When he boarded the Changcheng to come to Shanghai, he heard the Communists declare that over 70 passengers suspected of being "Nationalist agents" would undergo considerable training before being released.

It is rumored that the Communist army returned four-tenths of his boxes, but this has not been confirmed by him personally.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Police Office of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation recently transferred a case of embezzlement and smuggling of US dollars to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. On February 25, a China Airlines flight from San Francisco, USA, arrived in the city.

Later, because the minor worker Zhu Liukun requested leave, the police bureau sent personnel to the airport to investigate, and he learned that embezzlement and smuggling of US dollars had occurred.

<h3>Fire on the Banks of the Suzhou Creek This Morning - Dachang New Oil Depot Half Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] At approximately 0:30 this morning, a stack of goods at the rear of the Dachang New Oil Depot at No. 32 Guangfu West Road on the banks of the Suzhou Creek in Shanghai West suddenly caught fire. Because the goods stacked there were mostly rapeseed oil cakes and a large amount of cooking oil, they burned intensely. The oil depot was adjacent to the Dingxin Yarn Factory, which had fire-fighting equipment, so it was spared. Although the people in Dingxin assisted in the firefighting, their efforts were ineffective due to their limited strength. The Fire Department's Yichang Road team heard the alarm and immediately rushed to the scene, but the road was narrow, rugged, and winding, so they did not arrive at the scene until approximately 1:00 AM. After the firefighters bravely fought the fire, they had brought it under control by 2:00 AM this morning. The front warehouse of the Dachang New Oil Depot was preserved. The remaining fire was extinguished at approximately 3:00 AM. The loss is still difficult to estimate. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>

<h3>Matter of Borrowing Fishing Vessels for Anti-Piracy - The Custody Committee Has Not Yet Approved</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Regarding the previous request from the fishing groups of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the Custody Committee of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to borrow two armed fishing vessels for anti-piracy purposes, the reporter made inquiries to relevant personnel of the committee and the Fisheries Administration Office. According to them, this matter may involve legal issues, so it must be studied in detail before a decision can be made. According to the UNRRA agreement, the materials supplied by UNRRA can only be used for post-war rehabilitation and relief, and cannot be used for military purposes. If the fishing vessels are equipped with military equipment and turned into armed vessels, it would seem to violate the original agreement. Therefore, the committee cannot immediately approve the request.</p>

<h3>Teenage Girl Twice Deceived and Stranded - Sent to Reformatory but Suddenly Escapes</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhang Jinfeng, a girl from Liaoning, 18 years old, lives with her father, Zhang Fulin, at No. 22 Minle Village, Lianglukou, Chongqing. Her father makes a living as a vendor. Zhang fell in love with Wang Jianzhong, who runs a grocery store next door, and recently ran away with him to Shanghai. The two rented a room in a hotel and lingered there for half a month. One day, when they went to the Nanjing Grand Theater to see a movie, Wang gave Zhang 2 million yuan and left without saying goodbye. When Zhang finished watching the movie, not knowing the way, she went to the Kaiyuandan Hotel on Xizang South Road to stay overnight. The next morning, Zhang went to the entrance of the Nanjing Grand Theater again, hoping to reunite with Wang, but unexpectedly met a man named Ding Guoan, who struck up a conversation with her. Zhang told him everything. Ding falsely claimed that he would help her find her and send her back to Chongqing, so she followed him to a cooking shed at No. 4, Jinxian Road, Julu Road, where Ding continued to rape her for four or five days, and then disappeared without a trace. She was then evicted by the second landlord and wandered the streets. On the evening of the 8th of this month, Zhang had no choice but to report to the Lujiazhen Police Station. Chief Chen ordered the police to arrest Ding Guoan without success. On the 9th, the branch prepared a document and sent the girl to the Women's Reformatory run by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. After only a few days, the station suddenly received a letter from the Reformatory, stating that Zhang had destroyed the bamboo fence and escaped at 5:00 AM on the 23rd. They had searched everywhere for her without success. After receiving the letter, the branch immediately handed it over to the special group for detailed investigation. The police were ordered to go to the Reformatory to investigate and found no traces of her escape. At the same time, the Reformatory stated that there was no need to pursue her. The police bureau is now investigating whether there are other hidden facts in the case.</p>

<h3>Zhang Pengchun Gives Report on the News Freedom Conference; General Assembly Resolves to Draft Three Convention Drafts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Dr. Zhang Pengchun, the chief representative of China at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information in Geneva and representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, was invited by the United Nations Office in Shanghai to host a press conference yesterday morning to report on the proceedings of the News Freedom Conference. He stated that the most important resolution of the conference was to draft three conventions, namely: (1) Regarding those who collect and transmit international news, any accredited foreign correspondent from any contracting state shall have the right to enter and travel freely in any other contracting state and transmit news. Under normal circumstances, such news should not be censored; if censorship is implemented during peacetime, its work should be as limited as possible in scope. If that is not possible, a deadline should be set for the return of news drafts, and fees should be charged according to the number of telegraph words after censorship. (2) Regarding the establishment of international rights of correction, any contracting state may submit a statement of correction to the government of the country that originally issued the report, and that government shall publish it regardless of its opinion. Otherwise, the Secretary-General of the United Nations may be authorized to make corrections and promote them as much as possible. (3) News Freedom Convention. This convention is broad in scope and stipulates that restrictions may be imposed on freedom of information. If any two contracting states have a dispute due to the agreement, it should be referred to the International Court of Justice for adjudication.</p>
<p>The above three draft conventions must be submitted to the next session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (to be held on July 19 in Lake Success) for amendments, and then submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (to be held in Paris in September) for adoption, and will only become effective after ratification by the contracting states. In addition to the above three resolutions, the News Freedom Conference also passed 43 other resolutions by a majority vote, two of which were proposed by the Chinese delegation. Although these 43 resolutions are not conventions, any country that passes them is responsible for them in principle.</p>
<p>Participating Countries: 57</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang expressed great satisfaction with the outcome of the conference, and specifically pointed out several points that he believed had not been achieved in any previous international conference, namely: (1) There was an unusually large number of participating countries, a total of 57 (including Bolivia, Iran, and Ireland as observers). Each national delegation had two or three people participating in actual journalism work, and others were diplomatic personnel or people engaged in the news industry. (2) The conference had a year of preparation, so it was also the most successful in terms of procedure. At the same time, time was saved, and the general assembly closed two days earlier than expected. In addition to the plenary session, the conference was divided into four subcommittees, namely 1. Discussion of general principles, 2. Collection of international news, 3. Free publication and collection of domestic news, 4. Legal institutions. To avoid wasting time, the general debate, which is usually held in general international conferences, was moved to the first subcommittee, so that the other three subcommittees could proceed simultaneously. Therefore, the meeting, which was originally scheduled to last from March 23 to April 23, was able to close on April 21.</p>
<p>Meaning of Freedom of Information</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang also explained the meaning of "freedom of information," which does not only refer to the freedom of news practitioners, but to the freedom of all people in the world to obtain news.</p>
<p>Finally, a reporter asked what he thought was the failure of this conference. Dr. Zhang replied that it was difficult to draw an absolute line between failure and success at this conference. Some people believed that this conference did not make a significant contribution to the tense atmosphere of international politics, because people generally expect any international conference to help with international politics, but the nature of the news conference is different, and it is not its fault if it does not contribute to international politics. In fact, this conference at least did not increase the tense political atmosphere between countries. But Dr. Zhang also hoped that the next News Freedom Conference should pay more attention to concrete facts, such as the education of news personnel, newspaper printing, machinery, equipment, and technical issues should be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang went to Hangzhou for a short trip yesterday afternoon and will go to Nanjing soon to report on his work.</p>

<h3>Treasury Bills Issued Today; Discount Rate Set at 87.3 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Short-term treasury bills will be issued starting today, and today's discount rate has been set at 87.3 percent. That is, a 100-yuan treasury bill can be purchased for 87.3 yuan today, and the principal and interest of 105 yuan can be recovered after one month, which translates to a monthly interest rate of two cents. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank: The official document from the Ministry of Finance was only received yesterday (April 29), and the treasury bills will be issued today. Currently, one-month treasury bills are being issued temporarily. The so-called "one month" is calculated as 30 days, which is similar to a fixed deposit certificate and does not necessarily expire at the end of the month. Treasury bills with a term of two or three months will be discussed later as needed. The discount on treasury bills is posted daily at the Central Bank. At present, the National Bank has established a Treasury Bill Interest Rate Committee, which is composed of the heads of the Treasury Bureau, the Business Bureau, and the Audit Department, and the Director of the Treasury Bureau is the convener. The proposed interest rate discount for treasury bills is reviewed daily by the committee and submitted to the President of the Central Bank for approval and implementation. The issuance of short-term treasury bills will start in Shanghai only for the time being. Whether they will be issued in other places will be discussed after assessing the situation after the issuance. The issuance will be done by posting the rate, and it will be handled temporarily by the National Bank itself. The temporary sales locations are (1) Treasury Bureau, No. 24 East Zhongshan Road, (2) Business Bureau, No. 15 East Zhongshan Road, and (3) Hongkou Branch of the Treasury Bureau, intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wujin Road. Whether short-term treasury bills will be listed on the stock exchange in the future and whether other banks will be entrusted to sell them will depend on actual needs.</p>

<h3>Suspension of Commodity Tax on Wheat Flour, Tea, Leather, Etc.</h3>

In addition, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the bureau to strengthen the management of various factories and seriously handle registration in order to prevent private leakage, as the peak season for beverage and foreign beer sales is approaching. The bureau has ordered its subordinates to comply and has published a notice in the newspaper informing relevant manufacturers to quickly go to the bureau to complete registration procedures and is also planning to implement a general survey on a regular basis. If anyone is found to have deliberately concealed and failed to report, they will be transferred to the court for punishment in accordance with the regulations for private manufacturing and tax evasion.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Management Committee Strictly Implements Approved Cotton Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to maintain normal cotton prices, the Cotton Yarn Management Committee implements a price negotiation and price limit system for cotton purchases. All standard prices that have been approved and adjusted in the past are determined separately in different regions based on the production costs of local cotton farmers, the transportation costs of merchants, and the market supply and demand conditions. Since its implementation, most regions have been able to comply. However, recently, cotton prices have suddenly risen, especially in Hankou. After receiving the report, the committee believed that it was obvious that someone was manipulating the market. As a result, it specially convened relevant parties yesterday for detailed research. The committee agreed that the purchase prices approved by the committee were based on facts. Any relaxation of the price will affect the livelihood of the people. It is impossible to chase after the black market without standards. Moreover, the US loan has been completed, and US-aid cotton is on its way and will arrive in mid-May. In addition, the Cotton Yarn Management Committee is now purchasing foreign cotton arriving at the port without a permit in order. There is no shortage of cotton for spinning. The commission organizations and self-purchasing manufacturers in all cotton collection and distribution markets should stop purchasing if the selling price exceeds the price approved by the committee. The committee immediately telegraphed the decision to the Textile Construction Company and strictly ordered its subordinate offices, the Sixth District Guild Cotton Merchant Purchasing Joint Office, and the Yingkou Cotton Purchasing Joint Office to comply.</p>
<h3>Initial Registration Deadline for Cotton Yarn Has Expired</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Management Committee handles cotton yarn registration, and the cotton yarn registration certificate issued is valid for three months and expires after that date. Anyone who has obtained the above registration certificate must use the cotton yarn within the deadline as required and send the registration certificate to the association for cancellation. If it is found that the cotton yarn has not been used after the deadline, it may be disposed of in accordance with Article 11 of the Cotton Yarn Registration Method, in accordance with the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times. It is heard that the validity period for the initial registrants has expired, and the association will conduct a general survey of those who have not submitted the registration certificates within the deadline, and will handle the matter in accordance with the regulations, and will not be tolerant.</p>

<h3>Rayon Rises; Silk Falls</h3>
<p>The rayon market was high yesterday. No. 120 Xuzi Youguang opened at 254 million yuan in the morning, and the immediate price rose to 666 million yuan at midday. The progress continued in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 777 million yuan, and finally fell to 730 million yuan, an increase of 18 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The factory's market was soft yesterday morning and rose in the afternoon, eventually similar to the previous day's market. The dismantling price of grade D 5 dan goods was 395 million yuan, and the high zero dan price was 400 million yuan in the afternoon, but transactions were very rare. The situation in the dry market was also stable.</p>
<p>The silk market fell in the morning yesterday. Huaqiang Real Silk Quilt opened at around 157 million yuan, and then fell to around 660 to 10 million yuan. Finally, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it continued to decline, and the immediate closing price fell to 520 yuan. The Dacheng Checkered Crepe opened at 540,000 yuan and closed at 535,000 yuan. The raw materials rebounded in the afternoon, and the market was slightly stronger.</p>
<h3>The Market Conditions for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Remain Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was weak because the end of the month was approaching and there was a lack of new purchases. The initial opening price of 42s Blue Phoenix fine yarn was as low as 230 million yuan. Then, scattered households pulled up to 235 million yuan to close, which was a rebound of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day. 32s Blue Phoenix and others were reduced by 1 or 2 million yuan due to oversupply. The morning opening of 21s Double Horse yarn also fell. Halfway through, the traders on the trading floor cheered, but the actual sales were still sluggish, and the price rose by 1 million yuan. The other thick and thin yarns had their ups and downs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was selling due to news and the offer of textile construction. Dyeing factories were all watching. Although the Yangtze Gang had a stomach for medium-grade fine cloth spot goods, peers and powerful people kept selling, and the market was oversupplied. The initial opening price of Longtou fine cloth was as low as 4.95 million, and then it fell to a minimum of 4.88 million yuan due to the unstoppable downward trend. The recent closing price rebounded to 4.9 million yuan, a decrease of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining fine cloths, bi-ge, zhigong fine twill, etc., were also reduced, ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. However, the colored cloth and Shilin cloth markets remained firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was weak, and the price of the floor was falling. Buyers offered slightly higher prices, and transactions became more active. The delivery price of Jingyang fine velvet to the public treasury was 25 million, Donggou 21.5 million to 21.9 million, Haitijian 20.5 million, Nabei 21 million, Huoji 20 million, Yaohua 15.8 million, and Zhoupu seed flower 5 million to 5.08 million.</p>
<h3>Biluochun Market Slightly Strong</h3>
<p>Opening at 1.3 Million Yuan Per Catty</p>
<p>Biluochun, produced in Dongting Mountain, is also a valuable domestic tea. Although the new goods of this year have been in Shanghai for many days, the transactions have been quiet because both parties insist on their own prices. As of yesterday, both parties' attitudes have changed slightly, and the official opening price has been obtained, which is 1.3 million yuan per catty, and the market atmosphere is quite prosperous. The new fried green tea from Wenzhou and the mulberry buds from Huzhou are also opening in a stable manner. However, the new Longjing, which has been arriving continuously and is gradually becoming old, is still unable to support the floor, and the closing result is that it has been severely reduced compared to the previous time. As for the old tea, which is about to run out of inventory, it is as potentially popular as ever, and the price of Qimen floral fragrance and tea powder has risen sharply due to the strong absorption of the local market. In addition, the foreign tea market is about the same, and the fluctuations are very narrow.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Sales Stagnant; Flour, Oil, and Grains Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market opened in the morning because the production price rebounded, and the holders' minds were very firm, and they were eager to bid up the price. However, because the sales were wooden, although the price was high, it did not go out, so the rise stopped. The market remained flat in the afternoon, and the closing was even weaker. Zao rice in the Nan City market fell by 50,000 yuan, and Zhongguan goods in milled Xian fell by slightly less than 100,000 yuan. The rest were mostly flat. The Bei City market was also flat with fatigue. The special high japonica rice fell by 50,000 yuan to 4.15 million yuan. The amount of goods arriving yesterday increased, with a total of 8,067 shi in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>The price of flour fluctuated slightly. The transaction was quiet. The market was tired at the opening and firm at the end, and the result was slightly better than the previous day. The closing price of the warship powder was the original price. The old car opened lower and then recovered, and the closing price was higher than the previous day by 10,000 yuan. The iron skin fell below 800,000, a decrease of 230,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains were weak and dull. Yellow soybeans were still quiet, and the local market took very little. The price of beans finally fell by 50,000 yuan. The price of corn was slightly lower, but the price of Zhongguan goods was still fixed. Red grains turned down. Green beans were flat. Selected green was slightly firmer. The price of sesame was slightly firm due to the small amount of goods arriving. The high price of raw peanuts was slightly reduced by 50,000 yuan, and the price of medium and inferior goods was flat.</p>
<p>Edible oil fell again. The local sales were weak, and the customers did not inquire. Under the overall downturn of the grain market, people were exhausted and unbearable, so the price fell. Datong and other factories opened soybean oil, and the recycled goods were even more flooded. The lowest Dongfeng soybean oil was 8.45 million yuan, a drop of about 150,000 yuan. Raw oil was still flat, and Xiaojun sesame oil rose by 200,000 yuan alone. The soybean cake market turned lively, and the price rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Jin Hua Feng's generous donation, we have not felt any financial difficulties. However, in this era of volatile prices, we predict that the future of the poor women's childbirth assistance campaign will still be full of difficulties. For several months, Mr. Jin has given us his full support, enabling this good deed to proceed smoothly. In order to be responsible to Mr. Jin and to strengthen our service to countless impoverished women, we, as the instigators of the childbirth assistance campaign, must redouble our efforts and constantly encourage ourselves. On the one hand, we must review past shortcomings as a lesson for the future. As an ancient saying goes: "Do not forget the past; it is a guide for the future." That is the meaning of this. Finally, we hope that enthusiastic readers will continue to give us guidance, encouragement, and assistance. The so-called collective wisdom and gathering strength can achieve great things. If "Poor Women's Childbirth Assistance" can get the enthusiastic assistance of readers, its future will definitely be bright and brilliant!</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the National Games: Veteran Track and Field Athlete Hao Chunde Trains Diligently; Liang Zhao’an Predicts Men's and Women's Swimming Championships</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Several main roads in the sports field, such as Shuidian Road, Mailu Road, etc., are being rushed day and night by the Public Works Bureau. There are many workers, piles of gravel, asphalt stoves, and rollers along the way. The roads that have been repaired are wide and flat, and cars speeding on them have a taste of skating.</p>
<p>The openings in the sports field are all covered with billboards to conceal them, and it is barely passable at first glance. Decorations are in the final stages everywhere because the electricity has been connected. It is said that the press seats are located on the stands directly opposite the rostrum. During the peak period of the afternoon program, they happen to face the scorching sun in the west, which will greatly affect the visibility.</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM, several male and female athletes from Shanghai were practicing on the field. In the crowd, I met Hao Chunde, a veteran track and field athlete. He was still heroic, wearing a vest, shorts, and running shoes, supervising the practice of the Shanghai team. When asked what event he was participating in this time, he smiled modestly and said, "It's time for everyone to play, so I didn't participate in the competition this time, but I am serving as the track and field coach of the Shanghai team." It turns out that he is now busy running import and export trade.</p>
<p>The eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, followed by years of war, plunged track and field sports in Shanghai into a low ebb. People began to doubt whether the Shanghai track and field team could still dominate like they did during the Sixth National Games and win the championship. Mr. Hao is still optimistic. He casually cited a few examples, such as Lou Wenao's 10,000 meters, women's sprint, relay, and high jump, all of which are key to the Shanghai team's scoring.</p>
<p>Shen Kunnan, a famous track and field referee, was also at the field yesterday. He said that the reason for the decline of track and field is still based on unstable living conditions. Schools are the hotbed for cultivating athletes, but these days, building even a basic track costs hundreds of millions. How many schools can afford sports and health equipment? How can track and field not decline?</p>
<p>Walking out of the sports field, I ran into Chen Zhongde, a famous volleyball coach. According to his observation, this men's volleyball championship will become a battle between Guangdong and Hong Kong. In women's volleyball, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Guangdong may compete fiercely. He has a high opinion of Taiwan's women's volleyball team. They play Japanese-style volleyball, which is slightly different from the international style generally used in the country. There will definitely be wonderful scenes in the semi-finals and finals.</p>
<p>The floor of the gymnasium is being sanded with an electric sander, and it is said that it will be completed tomorrow. The inner circle of the floor is laid with mahogany, and the outer circle is made of fir. After sanding and polishing, the ten-year-old gymnasium will once again become a good place for basketball teams from all over the country to compete.</p>
<p>The swimming pool has also been renovated and completed. Now, the pool is being cleaned. It can probably be filled with water around the 4th or 5th. It takes 24 hours to fill the pool with water. The pool has a capacity of 420,000 gallons. At night, the wall lamps on both sides of the pool can be lit again. Unfortunately, the disinfection and filtration equipment of the pool has been dismantled by the Japanese enemy.</p>
<p>I met Liang Zhao'an, a senior figure in the swimming world, at the Chinese Youth Association. He is now the swimming instructor of the Shanghai team. According to his prediction, the men's and women's swimming championships in this session will be monopolized by the Hong Kong team. Players from Guangdong, Guangzhou, and Malaysia may pose some threat to Hong Kong. Speaking of Shanghai, he said: "There are a total of 27 swimming representatives. It is estimated that only Wang Zhongcheng's 100-meter backstroke and Wen Jingling's 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle swimming are expected to score points."</p>
<p>The athlete dormitory for the National Games, which was lent by the Zhongxun Corps on Shuidian Road, was moved from Shangchi Lane to Shanglian Lane yesterday. Athletes from Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangzhou, and Xinjiang have all moved in, all in double-decker beds in shared rooms. Many rooms are being painted. For some reason, no one in charge of managing the dormitory for the National Games was encountered there. Many athletes said: "Probably because the preparation period is not yet mature, they have to take care of everything themselves after moving in. Today, they changed to a new dormitory, and they had to move everything themselves before settling down."</p>
<p>The setting sun on the west hill covered the entire sports field of Zhongzheng Park. A group of male and female athletes from Fujian were actively practicing there. Their coach introduced several outstanding male and female athletes to the reporter. The female athlete Chen Biying's 100-meter sprint is 13.8 seconds, and the long jump is over 5 meters. Guo Zhangde and Chen Wensheng's low hurdles both have a score of 14.67 seconds. Wu Shuying's high jump reaches 1.285 meters. Most of them are students from Putian Middle School, short and capable, with dark skin. It is said that they participated in sports events in Shanghai and Nanjing last year and won awards.</p>

According to them, the college started classes in March, with classes held at two campuses on Pingliang Road and Beijing West Road, and it has been two months, but the professors have not received a penny of salary. Recently, President Lu Xirong forced Dean Jiang Zaihua to leave the school without the consent of the professors and arbitrarily changed the teaching time, causing time conflicts and making it impossible for the professors to be in two places at once. Moreover, when the professors could not come to the college to teach, he would arbitrarily ask someone to substitute.

<h3>Opening Day of the National Games: A Bright Start; Holding the Torch High and Marching Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Road; Relay Race Transmitting the President's Speech; Athletes in Eight Teams Relay Run Over the Entire 380 Kilometers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Nanjing-Shanghai torch relay long-distance run, which is the most meaningful event of this National Games, has been prepared by Li Ximou, Director of the Education Bureau of this city, in conjunction with Feng Bingxin, Director of the Sports Department of Jiaotong University. All 66 athletes are students from Jiaotong University, and each person runs an average of 6,000 meters throughout the journey. At 3:00 PM on May 2nd, the run will start in front of the Nanjing National Government Building. The first runner will be Liu Zhenzhong, who will hold the torch and carry the President's speech, which will be passed on to the runners in turn. After noon on May 5th, the torch will arrive in Shanghai. The last runner, Wang Nancun, will hold the torch high and respectfully carry the speech, starting in front of the Fudan University gate and running into the venue during the opening ceremony of the Games. Then, the torch will be used to light the four tripods on the east and west rostrums, and the chairman of the Games will respectfully read the President's speech.</p>
<p>The starting point for the last runner in this city was originally set at Jing'an Temple, then along Nanjing Road and North Sichuan Road, and finally to the venue in a parade. Later, the authorities stated that traffic control would be difficult when passing through the above-mentioned prosperous thoroughfares, so the result was to move the starting point to Fudan University. Now, all the athletes are divided into eight teams. The first and second teams will take a car to Nanjing at 9:00 AM on May 1st. The remaining teams will go to Wuxi, Yixing, Changshu, and Taicang on the next day and then go to various places to wait. The highway taken throughout the journey will be from Nanjing to Yixing along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway, from Yixing to Wuxi along the Yixing-Wuxi Highway, and from Wuxi to Shanghai along the Wuxi-Shanghai Highway. Because the relay race will be stopped at night, the athletes will stay overnight in Tangshan, Yixing, and Zhenru.</p>
<p>The funds for this relay race were raised by Li Ximou, Feng Bingxin, and Ji Wenmei from various sources. The sneakers for all the athletes were donated by Hong Nianzu from the Zhongda Zhonghua Factory. The vests and socks were jointly donated by the Xinguang Underwear Factory and the Feilun Sewing Thread Factory for 65 million yuan. The food and accommodation for the athletes along the way will be provided by the alumni of Jiaotong University.</p>

<h3>Honolulu Overseas Chinese Athletes Li Dihua and Two Others Arrive in Shanghai for the National Games Tennis Competition</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Dihua, Mei Jielin, and Qian Runshan, representatives of the overseas Chinese from Honolulu participating in the National Games, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong by Sky King aircraft at 3:45 PM yesterday and immediately checked into the Yangtze Hotel. Among the three, Li is the team leader, and Mei and Qian are participating in the singles and doubles tennis competitions. Li and his party left Honolulu for Hong Kong on April 24th. During their three-day stay in Hong Kong, they held a friendly tennis doubles match with Xu Weipei and Shi Liejin, which ended in a draw.</p>
<p>According to Li, this is the first time that overseas Chinese from Honolulu have participated in the National Games. He hopes to take this opportunity to promote the connection between overseas Chinese and the motherland. Li is the manager of the Pacific Machinery Company and is coming to Shanghai at his own expense. Mei runs a lumber business in Pearl Harbor and is 31 years old. Qian is an employee of the Alexander &amp; Baldwin Insurance Company and is 35 years old. Both have more than 20 years of experience in tennis. Qian and Behrend's doubles team has won the Honolulu Tennis Open Championship every year from 1944 until last year, and they have strong strength. This time to China, there is great hope for the tennis championship. According to Li, the expenses for Mei and Qian to come to Shanghai were raised by the leaders of the Honolulu overseas Chinese business community. As for the expenses after arriving in Shanghai, he intends to ask the government for subsidies. He said that if it were not for financial constraints, Honolulu would have representatives participating in basketball, baseball, and swimming this time. If the government can subsidize, it will increase the interest of overseas Chinese in returning to the country to participate in the National Games. It is also heard that Li and others will move to the Paramount Hotel today for a temporary stay until the end of the National Games.</p>

<h3>The Attitude of Patients Towards Doctors</h3>
<p>— Qiu Jingzhou</p>
<p>Looking through the newspapers and various magazines in the valley, there are often news and articles about us doctors. From these, we can see that besides "lawsuits every year," there are many unpleasant things happening between patients and doctors. Even if it doesn't lead to disputes, there's still plenty of sarcastic criticism and abuse.</p>
<p>Do you know what the most common reason for being scolded is? It's charging money! For doctors and hospitals to charge money is simply a sin, a crime. There's a newly released domestic film called "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon." The final scenes show the female protagonist giving birth and being rejected by the hospital because she couldn't pay the fees. According to reports, the Chinese Medical Association petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau to instruct film companies not to shoot similar scenes in the future, arguing that it damaged the reputation of the medical profession. Some people disagreed with this and strongly criticized it, saying:</p>
<p>"A hospital should be a place for treating illnesses and saving lives, as well as a charitable institution. It shouldn't be like other ordinary offices that rigidly adhere to procedures, nor like a store where you have to pay before receiving the goods. The reason is that a patient's time, in the struggle between life and death, is often extremely critical. Missing a few minutes could render a treatable patient incurable. This is true for difficult births, as well as emergencies. Therefore, a doctor, standing from a humanitarian standpoint, naturally can't bear to let patients suffer from delays or even watch a treatable person die. They should act with the heart of a parent, disregarding everything else and prioritizing saving the person first."</p>
<p>However, the reality is not always the case. Many private hospitals, and even public hospitals, are no exception. They often have a strong commercial inclination, opening their mouths to ask for money, as if treatment has become a means of seeking wealth. If faced with a difficult birth or emergency, public hospitals must follow the rules, prioritizing based on registration order. Otherwise, you'll have to pay double the special registration fee, and even then, immediate treatment isn't guaranteed. As for general private hospitals, it's common to see them taking advantage of others' misfortune and even engaging in extortion and intimidation. They seem to think that it's the patient who is dying and the patient's family who is anxious, and that it has nothing to do with the hospital. Without money, nothing can be done, and the patient can only be left to die... During the Anti-Japanese War, Shen Fu wrote the screenplay "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours," which also depicted a greedy doctor demanding payment from a poor civil servant's wife before delivering her baby. If literary works can reflect reality to some extent, it shows that such phenomena exist in society, and we can't say that exposing such sinful behavior is wrong (see page 627 of the 74th issue of the Industry and Commerce News Weekly, March 29, 1937)."</p>
<p>I don't want to deny everything outright. And some colleagues have openly exposed and corrected these issues (for example, Wang Huangying in the preface to his Medical Handbook). Besides, within ten steps, there must be fragrant grass; within ten households, there must be faithful people. There are still plenty of good doctors like Dr. Ding in "Sui Han Tu" (written by Chen Baichen) and "Metamorphosis" (written by Cao Yu). These people won't be scolded. Although their title is also "doctor," their actions are beyond reproach.</p>
<p>Actually, what's the use of "scolding"? Human notions of self-interest cannot be compared with moral concepts. Those who are blinded by profit, even if you reprimand them with "morality" and "benevolence," will remain unmoved. "Money" is indeed a sharp weapon. It's best if there's no financial relationship between patients and doctors.</p>
<p>At this point, a friend interrupted, saying: "How is that possible? The relationship between people is purely economic. Doctors treat patients, and patients pay doctors for their services. There's nothing wrong with that. Han Feizi once said, 'Doctors suck the pus from people's wounds and drink their blood. They are not close relatives, but they are motivated by profit (see "Five Vermin").' Since doctors make a living from medicine, it means they rely on treating illnesses to sustain themselves. Rich people spend thousands or tens of thousands a day, it doesn't matter to them, and they won't scold you. But you need to be more lenient with those who don't have money."</p>
<p>I continued, "The problem is that the rich are the minority, and the poor are the majority! No matter how kind-hearted you are and how sincerely you serve your patients, if you charge money, you'll be in trouble. For example, right now, 200,000 units of penicillin cost 1.6 million yuan per bottle (Ningbo price on March 15th of this year). Including distilled water and handling fees, if you only charge 2 million yuan, you're already being generous to the point of disregarding your own well-being. But the average patient still can't afford it. The famous Professor Hong Shen complained like this:</p>
<p>'My three-and-a-half-year-old son has a strange illness. He's been sick for over a month and has been hospitalized since the 13th of last month. Although the doctors have been diligently treating him, there's been no improvement. He needs to be injected with streptomycin and other medications every day, costing about 600,000 yuan, with no guarantee of success. My income from teaching at the Municipal Drama School is over 1.2 million yuan per month, and my writing income is also over 1 million yuan per month. Combined, it's only enough to buy five days' worth of medication... (June 9, 36, postscript to the 47th issue of Ta Kung Pao Drama and Film).'</p>
<p>The poor living conditions of cultural figures are well-known. I really can't bear to charge them money. Also, the fees at Wuling Hospital here are vastly different from those of other hospitals in Ningbo. Inpatient fees are 120,000 yuan per day (adjusted from April of this year, the local price of rice is 4.4 million per stone). It can be said that even the food costs are not covered, let alone other medical expenses and room fees. But if a poor farmer has a chronic surgical condition that requires long-term hospitalization, it will cost 3.6 million yuan per month, or 7.2 million yuan for two months. This is a number that most people will shake their heads at."</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that when people have physical injuries, they don't also have financial injuries (meaning that people can receive free medical treatment when they are sick). Our livelihood should be the responsibility of the state and have real security. This way, many unpleasant atmospheres between patients and doctors can be eliminated. I always feel that when we doctors worry and work for patients, sometimes we are woken up in the middle of the night and rise from our warm beds, braving the cold, rain, and snow, or under the scorching sun, holding umbrellas, rushing to treat patients on desolate roads ten or twenty li away. What is this for? It's to save those lives on the brink of death! This is precisely to express the supreme spirit and professional virtue of us doctors. We really shouldn't let patients taint this spirit and virtue with money!</p>
<p>However, what is hateful is that the endless war, incompetent politics, and economic panic make it difficult for good people to live. A recent example is Mr. Li Tingguang, the school doctor at Nankai University, who committed suicide out of frustration because his monthly salary of 9 million yuan was not enough to support his family of eight (Ta Kung Pao, April 15th of this year). In such a world, how can one be a doctor with peace of mind, except by preparing to be scolded?</p>
<p>Also, in "Medical Disputes," I mentioned that the trend of patients being litigious is increasing, which means that even good doctors cannot avoid going to court. Turning to my diary from July 1st of last year, I recorded the following: 'The wife and daughter of Ke Peiyao, the director of the business department of Shanghai Cathay Department Store, sued Dr. Guo Zhizong for causing death due to negligence. The attached civil suit demanded a total of 416,884,000 yuan. Fortunately, he was declared innocent. Otherwise, if the case had been established, it would have bankrupted not only this generation but also the next three generations, even if he worked as a cow or horse to repay it.'"</p>
<p>Looking around, how can the cold treatment of patients towards us doctors not make us doctors feel disheartened and discouraged!</p>

<h3>Double Green Building — Medical Notes</h3>
<p>(3) The Distress of Being a Doctor</p>
<p>When I have nothing to do after dinner, my children, Hailong and Haishan, always ask me to tell them stories. Although telling stories is the responsibility of a father, it's also a chore. To be honest, I often get anxious about this task. Last night, I picked up a translated copy of Xia Mianzun's "Education of Love" and flipped through it, hoping to find some material to tell the children. After flipping through it, I came across a section about "doctors." I was very moved after reading it, and now I excerpt a few paragraphs:</p>
<p>"Can you sacrifice your own happiness to the point of not having a moment of rest? Can you remain calm in the face of the rude remarks made by ignorant and unaware patients? Can you sustain your enthusiasm for saving people from suffering without being bothered by the trouble? When they need you, they respect you; when they don't need you, no one pays attention to you anymore; can you not be weary of such a profession?..."</p>
<p>"Before becoming a doctor, you have to dissect corpses, dissect the internal organs of decaying bodies, and witness the tragic and desperate scenes of humanity, and hear the mournful groans." "After graduating from medical school, to become a medical doctor, you have to put in a lot of effort, and often continue to do long-term research without gaining anything." "Even if you become a medical doctor, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll have a good meal." "Doctors are like slaves or servants. When there is a house call, they have to go, whether it's in the deep of winter or the heat of summer."</p>
<p>"The rich will criticize you for not being thorough in your diagnosis, and the poor will resent you for overcharging them. After years of hard work, you can only barely make ends meet."</p>
<p>"Doctors want to live a comfortable life, they must endure many years of hardship. If you are not careful during this period, and you misdiagnose a disease, your reputation will be ruined and no one will ask for your advice. You have to change your profession and start suffering and enduring anew."</p>
<p>"When you have cured many poor patients and gradually spread your reputation to the ears of the wealthy, new doctors will come and open a practice nearby, competing with you for business. Being a doctor is really not an easy profession."</p>
<p>After reading these paragraphs about doctors, we will naturally have a common feeling: that the profession of "being a doctor" is not as perfect as the average person can imagine. Not only is it not perfect, but it can be said to be a kind of hard life that ordinary people simply cannot endure.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this chaotic China, it is especially difficult to be a doctor. Even if you are loyal to your service and have a clear conscience, if you are unlucky enough to encounter a thorny illness, then you will not only suffer a great loss in terms of reputation, but you will also be sued, and even have the possibility of "eating a lawsuit." Recently, several colleagues have been sued for being too loyal to their profession, saying that they neglected their duties and caused manslaughter due to negligence. Although these cases have been declared innocent, the psychological damage to the parties involved is truly impossible to estimate and will never be made up for.</p>
<p>Alas! Who would still say that the profession of being a doctor is enviable? No wonder my eldest son, Haiman, doesn't want to study medicine.</p>
<h3>Good Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>Currently, there is no direct sterilizing agent for tuberculosis bacteria. All therapies help patients strengthen their body's ability to resist bacteria. At most, it limits the activity of tuberculosis bacteria. Promotes calcification of lesions. Among them, air injection is still an effective method. Because tuberculosis bacteria can build a layer of wax shell in the body. Existing drugs cannot penetrate this shell to kill the bacteria. Excessive toxicity is harmful to human cells. Therefore, there is still no specific medicine for treatment.</p>
<p>In addition to injecting air, ordinary pulmonary tuberculosis patients have been injected with calcium needles, glucose calcium, and vitamin D. According to the China Natural Science Newsletter (Central News Agency, Nanjing): "The compound ERG, which produces vitamin D, is now being tested on pulmonary tuberculosis patients by Dr. Rui Bo, and most of them have shown significant improvement after six months. After examining patients with severe tuberculosis, it was found that the bacteria were greatly reduced or disappeared. This drug is not a direct sterilizing agent, nor is it transformed into vitamin D to exert its effect. It helps patients strengthen their body's resistance to bacteria, so that they can recover sooner."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the so-called new treatment method still does not escape the scope of enhancing resistance. It can be used as evidence that there is still no direct sterilizing agent.</p>
<p>However, there are lung patients who have been injected with countless calcium needles and still have no tendency to harden. In addition to prescribing rest for those who cannot be treated by air injection due to their condition, there is often no way to help. The author encountered two cases, which were ineffective after prolonged calcium injection, and improved after using "Ebasal" (Bayer). Ebasal is a copper preparation produced by Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, mainly used for exudative pulmonary tuberculosis and exudative-cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis, especially for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis with a tendency to harden. This medicine is divided into five doses: 0.01 cm, 0.025 cm, 0.05 cm, 0.075 cm to 0.1 cm. It was originally a dry powder preparation, and when used, it was prepared into a solution with distilled water, and was only limited to intravenous injection, once every two days, increasing in order. After each full dose is used up, it is necessary to rest for two or three months before continuing to use it, and calcium needles and vitamins can still be injected during the interval. One young patient had a significant increase in food intake and stopped coughing after receiving a full dose of "Ebasal" and calcium needles. He is still doing business in Taiwan and still writes letters from time to time to say thank you. There was also a worker who moved from the mainland with the factory. After traveling to Shanghai, he was tired and hard-working, and suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, and also had enlargement of the heart. His appetite was greatly reduced, his appearance was thin, and he was treated with calcium needles for a long time without effect. He was extremely discouraged and almost despaired of life. The author tried to treat him with "Ebasal" and firmly told him to maintain optimism and reduce labor. After three full doses of injection, the condition improved greatly. Now he is physically strong and still works in the factory, and his pessimism and despair have become a thing of the past. The real reward for a doctor is not in the amount of the consultation fee and the prosperity of the reputation, but in the sincere comfort after completing the mission. Therefore, the grateful smile of the patient is the greatest encouragement to the doctor. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Jun Qing notes that although the "Ebasal" recommended by Mr. Xu is effective, its side effects are also very large, so do not use it indiscriminately without the guidance of an expert. Otherwise, this drug has been around for many years, why is there still no sound and color, and no one pays attention to it?</p>

<h3>On benefiting others and oneself</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Mr. Bai Yong previously wrote an article in this publication entitled "Altruism, Fun, Selfishness," in which he mentioned that some Chinese people regard serious things as child's play, and regard play things as serious; he believes that this phenomenon is due to people valuing self-interest. The author believes that this statement is not only insightful, but also the conclusion is very correct.</p>
<p>Some people in our country often handle very important things in a hasty and lackluster manner. What is the reason for this? The reason is nothing more than that those things have no direct interest to them personally, so although the event is important, they deal with it sloppily. If it involves the inflow and outflow of private money, they will definitely do it vigorously and vividly, and their spirits will appear extraordinarily sufficient.</p>
<p>It is only natural for people to value self-interest; people who sacrifice themselves to feed tigers are rarely seen in history, and it is good enough for one to do so without harming others. However, excessive self-interest often fails to achieve the purpose expected by selfishness, and will produce the opposite effect, such as Confucius's saying "haste makes waste". Let's take an example to clarify it. For example, the purpose of advertisements broadcast on radio in our country is naturally to promote the sales of goods and increase profits, but the audience of radio all knows that according to the current advertising techniques, it is not only insufficient to attract customers, but sometimes it will make the audience hate the goods praised in the advertisements. We must know that the purpose of people listening to the radio is mostly for entertainment, not necessarily to listen to advertisements; but today's radio announcers often put ten or twenty kinds of goods advertisements together to report, like a monk chanting scriptures, reading for ten or twenty minutes in a row, with occasional interruptions such as "Ah yes," "This station's phone number is so-and-so," or "Attention to Mr. So-and-so's residence," and even boasting that if the audience does not buy a certain commodity today, the price will rise tomorrow. What other listeners think, I don't know, but personally, I always feel that advertising has reached this point, it is inevitably a bit of the idiom "exhausting evil," too good, and I can't help but feel disgusted, and secretly made up my mind: even if I want to buy a certain type of commodity, I will never be willing to choose the goods advertised in the advertisement. I guess that there are also a lot of people among the radio audience who feel the same way as I do. This is an example of being too good to achieve the purpose.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the advertisements broadcast on radio by Westerners are mostly simple and clear, and they are finished in a few words, and then they continue with the entertainment program, which makes people feel clean and generous. Some companies and businesses in the United States not only do not adopt the method of self-praise for their products, but also go further and advocate telling the truth; for example, a certain soap factory only said about its own soap: soap is just soap, and this brand of soap is not more exceptional than other brands of soap. For example, Hollywood's "Farmers Market" once said in an advertisement: "Today, the tomatoes in this market are of poor quality, and even feeding pigs feels too bad. It is best to wait until tomorrow to buy them." Such advertisements often leave a good impression in people's minds and are sufficient to promote the sales of goods.</p>
<p>This reminds me that during World War II, there was an announcer on the German Berlin radio station nicknamed "Good Good Jazz." This gentleman was an excellent current affairs commentator; his remarks may have contained toxins, but because his language was humorous, his arguments were incisive, his tone was pleasant, and his words were always thinking of the listeners' current interests, even the radio listeners of the United Nations loved to listen to "Good Good Jazz" program. What is the reason for this? The reason is very simple, because his program is more entertaining than promotional, that is, it is entertaining in a way that is also informative. In other words, "Good Good Jazz" is to achieve the purpose of self-interest by means of benefiting others.</p>
<p>The result of everyone fighting for self-interest is that self-interest is difficult to obtain, but it often creates a chaotic situation. The phrase "everyone acts in their own way" on the one hand means that everyone seeks self-interest, and on the other hand means that there is no order. The author may as well give a "seeing the big from the small" example here. Because public vehicles in this city are not enough, passengers often crowd in a rush; because everyone wants to be the first, the door is blocked, forming a chaotic mess, but it is not as fast as getting on the bus in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>No matter how humble a person is, if he is always selfish, he will never gain people's support; no matter how big or small a thing is, if he only plans for himself when dealing with it, there will be no good results. Westerners do things mostly with a whole plan in advance, because they think carefully and arrange everything perfectly, so even though the special situation is complicated, it is still organized. The secret is nothing more than that the person who is doing things focuses on the things he is doing, not on his own self-interest, so he can promote the completion of the matter. By extension, if we can think for the other person when we treat people and things, we can avoid many unnecessary troubles. The Confucian concept of "repaying resentment with virtue" and Jesus's teaching of "overcoming hatred with love" are intended to benefit others, but in fact they are also self-interest.</p>
<h3>Things happen by chance</h3>
<p>— Tiaoying</p>
<p>One day, Hollywood resident Nan Rick suddenly discovered that his car had been stolen, so he borrowed a neighbor's car to report the case, but on the way home, a speeding car came from behind and dented the back of the car Nan Rick was riding in. Nan Rick was furious, thinking that his car had already been stolen, and borrowing someone else's car had caused another problem. How was he going to explain it when he got back! He jumped out of the car in a rage to negotiate with the owner of the car behind, but unexpectedly, the car behind was the very one that had been stolen! The car thief was trying to escape, but Nan Rick would not let him go, and managed to catch the thief with the stolen goods and hand him over to the police.</p>
<p>A woman named McKinney in Washington, D.C., fell from the window of a five-story building, but unexpectedly, someone had a very strong clothesline hanging outside the window on the fourth floor. She fell on the rope and bounced into a bathroom on the third floor - a male guest was taking a bath.</p>
<p>In Riva, France, a man named Tan Lier had almost the same luck as Mrs. McKinney, but even more strange. He fell all the way down from the seventh floor, and when he was about to reach the cement on the sidewalk, there was a baby stroller below, and the mother had just picked up the child. Tan Lier happened to fall into the empty stroller - Tan Lier was unharmed, and the child was not frightened at all, but the mother was so frightened that she fainted and injured her ankle when she fell to the ground.</p>
<p>In Camden, New Jersey, USA, one day a house suddenly filled with thick smoke, as if there was a fire. After the firefighters arrived, it took them an hour to find the source of the smoke. It turned out that there was a swallow's nest under the eaves of the house, and the careless swallow had brought an unextinguished cigarette butt into it.</p>
<p>A pigeon in Washington, D.C., caused the same trouble as the swallow in New Jersey in the previous section, but when the firefighters arrived, they were unable to do anything and watched as an apartment building turned to ashes.</p>
<h3>Turtle Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Chengren</p>
<p>Turtles are abundant in tropical oceans, and each time they lay eggs, they can lay from one hundred to two hundred eggs. The large ones often reach more than six feet, and the small ones are less than two inches. Those that live on the coast are commonly called sea turtles, and those that live on land are called land turtles.</p>
<p>Turtles are also revered as a kind of "totem" among the natives of the South Seas. Turtle sacrifices are also held in places such as the Andaman Islands and Borneo, and there are restrictions on hunting.</p>
<p>The turtle sacrifice held in the Andaman Islands is performed by the elder of the tribe first painting the skin of a young man with mud, decorating his hair with hibiscus, and wrapping his waist with leaves. He sits upright on a straw mat, and the elder vigorously tears the meat of the turtle caught last night into pieces and puts them in a wooden bowl. The meat pieces are dipped in oil and smeared on the young man's body and lips. At this time, the young man is not allowed to speak. Then the elder will make the young man swallow the meat pieces, and his close relatives on his left and right will shake the young man's body from side to side. The young man sits upright all night, not allowed to close his eyes and doze off. In order to prevent him from falling asleep, his family members, brothers and sisters gather around him and tell him strange and wonderful things. The young man is aware of the knowledge of being a strong man, so he will never fall asleep. It is not until the third day that he can lie down, and on the fourth day he can go to the coast to wash off the oil on his hair and skin, and he can still catch fish in the sea.</p>
<p>On the same day, relatives and friends will be invited to hold a grand sacrifice. The young man who has become a strong man will shake the "Bigeas" tree, scattering the leaves, and the villagers will beat drums and clap their hands, dancing wildly all night. After this ritual, the young man is recognized as a formal strong man and can participate in various gatherings and fight with foreign tribes.</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of a Trip to Mount Hua</h3>
<p>— Half-Dream</p>
<p>I, Hua Shan, once stayed at the East Peak, exploring Wei Qing's gamble platform, a dangerous place; ascended the South Peak, exited the South Gate, descended the Changkong Plank Road, explored the Chaoyuan Cave and He Zu Cave, two dangerous places; ascended the Great Upper Square, Three Officials Cave, Eight Immortals Cave, Golden Immortal Cave, three dangerous places. At the time, I did not know the dangers, thinking that the Azure Dragon Ridge was a flat and wide road, but I don't know why the banished immortal was so timid, it is really incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Generally, mountain climbing is all about doing it in one go. If the spirit is discouraged, the strength will weaken. Many who travel to Mount Hua stop at the Returning Heart Stone. They can't even climb the Thousand-Foot Cliff and Hundred-Foot Gorge, let alone the Changkong Plank Road and gamble platform? What the ancients called overcoming difficulties, isn't it not only the legs and feet as the vehicle, but also the spirit of moving forward as a major part of it?</p>
<p>When I was at the East Peak, I met a Taoist priest, Wu Yuan Dun, who presented me with poems, and I wrote two poems in response. One said, "On the summit of Chaoyang Peak, the wind is raging, coming from afar to climb makes the excitement even longer, I wish to taste a sip of immortal dew, for hundreds of millions of years to be full of fine wine (Chaoyang Peak is the East Peak, there is an immortal palm on it)." The iron chessboard is in the iron pavilion, climbing dangers and descending into the depths are like being in the void, the world is originally like a game of chess, throwing a pot and laughing breaks the primordial chaos. I left it as a memento, I don't know if it still exists today.</p>
<p>The height of Changkong Plank Road is said to be nine li up and down (according to the Taoist priest). At the beginning of spring that year, a pilgrim fell and was searched for, and his bones were found after three days. The place of falling was no longer under the jurisdiction of Huayin County, but according to the iron chains and wooden boards, they were very strong and not easy to break. If it wasn't for a misstep, he wouldn't have been buried in the wilderness. The place for contemplation (also known as He Lao Stone Chamber), is indeed an excellent training ground. Those with strong will, like immortals Hao Taigu and others, sitting in meditation here, will have considerable assistance. As for those who choose scenic spots and explore curiosities, once they arrive, they will never linger, it is purely a fleeting impression, and no relationship is born.</p>
<p>The West Peak is also known as Lotus Peak. Taoist Liu Yunxia asked me to write a couplet, and I wrote the sentence "Ten thousand mountains surround the beautiful sky, nine yokes soar into the clouds, the Tao proves immortality," leaving it as a memento. Beside it, a Taoist priest named Chen wrote for me</p>
<h3>Jasmine</h3>
<p>— Floating Clouds</p>
<p>As spring deepens, jasmine comes on the market. This flower is clear and beautiful, not large, but rich and fragrant, most suitable for women to press on their temples to aid their makeup. Li Yu in Idle Sentiments writes: "The jasmine flower is solely designed to aid makeup, is it born to charm women? All flowers open at dawn, this one alone opens at dusk. Opening at dusk is to prevent people from playing with it, keeping it secret to await dawn makeup. All flowers have no holes on the calyx, this one alone has holes. Having holes is because it cannot be supported without them, born to be a place to stand. If so, women's makeup is a natural creation. Planting other trees is for men, planting this flower is solely for women; since it is for women, then it should be regarded as family. Only Lin Bu takes plum as his wife, those who take jasmine as their wife should be all over the world."</p>
<p>Master Li's argument is quite elegant. In an era with men as the center of society, "planting this flower solely for women" is indeed extremely rare! The jasmine can be said to be a meritorious servant of women. But then he says: "Since it is for women, then it should be regarded as family." In the end, the jasmine is still for men.</p>
<p>Also, in Six Records of a Floating Life, there is also an interesting record about jasmine: "...Yun had already laughed and fell into my arms, unable to make a sound, feeling the strong fragrance of jasmine on her temples, I patted her back and explained it with other words, saying: 'I think the ancients used jasmine's shape and color like pearls, so they used it to aid makeup and press temples, not knowing that this flower must be stained with the air of oily hair and powdered face, its fragrance is even more lovable, the offered Buddha's hand should retreat three houses.' Yun then stopped laughing and said: 'The Buddha's hand is a gentleman among fragrances, only existing intentionally or unintentionally; jasmine is a petty person among fragrances, so it must borrow people's power, its fragrance is like flattering and smiling with shrugged shoulders.' I said: 'Why do you keep away from gentlemen and get close to petty people?' Yun said: 'I laugh at gentlemen loving petty people.'"</p>
<p>Once jasmine is on a beauty's head, its fragrance becomes even more lovable, it is because what is lovable about it is not entirely the fragrance of jasmine, but because there is a beauty's ingredient in it. Flowers and beauties complement each other, and Yunniang's theory of gentlemen and petty people is inevitably vulgar, but her pure happiness in the boudoir is indeed enviable.</p>
<p>According to some, jasmine is also called molli, and Su Dongpo called it hidden musk, its fragrance is known to be strong. The Interpretation of Names says that it originated in Persia, and now it mostly grows in the south. The northern name nai mu shui comes from Fujian and Guangdong, the trunk is thick and the stem is strong, only three or four feet high; the vine comes from Jiangnan, with weak stems growing in clusters, and some are as long as ten feet. The leaves are similar to tea but slightly larger, and the flowers have single and double petals. A kind of pearl jasmine flower is like a small lotus and is the most precious. The buds are like pearls at first, and they only bloom at dusk, filling the room with fragrance. Plucking off the tender branches, allowing the branches to grow again, then the branches will become more luxuriant and the flowers will become denser. He said that behind the West Peak, there is a cave called Black Wind, with steep cliffs up and down, and there is no way to enter. Huang Ziyang (named Guangyao) of Huayin was curious, and used a long rope to bind a giant basket, sat in it, and was lowered from the peak, reaching the cave door and entering it. Holding a torch, he walked for more than a day, and saw several people in strange clothes. They asked Huang where he came from and why he came here. Huang replied that he was seeking the Tao. They all praised his ambition, talked to him for several days, and then gave him a book. Huang took it out, kept it secret, and studied it day and night, gaining a glimpse of the doorway. One day, he was lying in bed and hadn't woken up, and was seen by someone. Suddenly, a fire started in the book, burning it all to ashes. Huang's spirit was confused, and after a long time, he became even more confused, so he became a Taoist priest. After a few months, he returned home again. Feeling a little clearer, he used his insights to teach his disciples, and wrote a book called The Source of Principle and Qi, which was printed and distributed outside. I entrusted Taoist Chen to find this book, but I have not been able to find it yet. It is difficult to determine whether what he said is true or false.</p>
<p>Hao Taigu in Huashan Sheng Cave, seen in the Biography of the Seven Immortals novel, but Huashan also has Hao Zu Cave, I was unable to climb and explore it. Except for the Middle Peak (also known as Jade Maiden Peak), the four peaks of Huashan are all strange, standing upright like lotus flowers, looking at them from afar, white clouds obscure their waists, like tied belts. When going down the mountain, there was a poem saying: "Layered clouds are gloomy, the ancient lotus flower is tied to my heart, having fully seen the strange mountains for fifty li, a clear sun bids farewell to the distant peaks."</p>

<h3>Longevity Star</h3>
<p>— Ding Guo</p>
<p>Mrs. Qudema Mai. Qin. Taylor of Wisconsin, USA, is 105 years old this year, and still bathes with ice water every day. It is said that ice water can make the skin smooth and wrinkle-free. Mrs. Taylor's appearance is indeed still very good, with very few wrinkles.</p>

<h3>Night Talk with You Han</h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>Gradually feeling the spring cold subsiding, the fragrant news by the moon is still faint, let us rest together temporarily under the trees, painstakingly seeking guidance from the scriptures; to know that being ashamed of you is also being ashamed of myself, let people say what is right and what is wrong, pure conversation and expression are mostly affairs, laughing and forgetting words are not mutually contradictory.</p>
<p>Speaking must know not to touch one's tongue, peach and plum trees naturally form a path without words, who taught the monkey to climb trees, I laugh at myself for being like a louse waving its arms; I wish to follow the clouds and dragons up and down, directly discarding the discussion and ignoring morning and dusk. The green lamp has a taste of empty regret, cherish this good night and discuss together.</p>
<h3>The Complete Collection of Wang Qu Chan's Miscellaneous Writings</h3>
<p>Old Qu Gong is not thin, his old learning progresses daily, he makes art for his leisure, his strict brush array is grand. Heart and hand both forget each other, wonderful fun is transported naturally, small characters draw straight lines, Tang methods trace Jin rhyme; firm and upright like the man, not making flattering attempts, writing long scrolls to suit his mood, the sect's style leaks remaining essence, changing geese and writing on skirts, the stories are originally wearable, I want to beg for the secret, hoping that nothing will be stingy.</p>
<h3>Qing Lei Studies Figures</h3>
<p>Previously, I wrote a passage about the "Jinshan Temple" Talks (which was published on the 22nd). After reading the advertisement in this newspaper by the temple monk Tai Cang regarding the temple's fundraising and reconstruction, mentioning the words "Jinshan Jiangtian Temple," I remembered that "Jinshan Temple" is not the temple's official name. "Jinshan" is the name of the mountain (actually just a small island in the Yangtze River). The temple is on the mountain, but the mountain is not the temple. It should have a separate temple name. I am not unaware of the name "Jiangtian Temple." The story of the imperial stele of "Jiangda Yilan" was also mentioned in my previous article. However, if I had not read Tai Cang's article, I would have forgotten it for a long time. The reason is that the name "Jinshan Temple" has been circulating for a long time and widely. Not only is it so in plays and novels, but even literati in the era of the imperial examinations used it as a reference. In the eleventh year of Guangxu, the yiyou year of the Qing Dynasty, the main examiner of Zhejiang was Bai Huan, and the associate examiner was Pan Yantong. There was an unsuccessful candidate who made a humorous couplet based on the surnames of Bai and Pan: "Jinshan Temple kicks the literary champion, it is difficult to escape the overturned alms bowl"; "Purple Stone Street curtains pick up the martial sister-in-law, secretly agreeing to tailor clothes." The pairing is extremely skillful, and each word is stable and well-matched. It also uses "Jinshan Temple" as the temple name. I think this author was deeply influenced by the impression of the theater stage. The upper couplet has "flooding," "broken bridge," "producing ten," "closing the alms bowl," and the lower couplet has "provoking," "tailoring clothes." The old capital actor Xiao Cuihua often performed it. "Purple Stone Street" is seen in the Water Margin. Whether there is such a street in Yangyi County, Shandong today is not verifiable.</p>
<p>In the long special article "Vice Presidential Election Runoff" published on the first page of the 25th, there are many witty remarks. A female representative asked Mr. Weng, "Who does your conscience vote for?" Representative Weng smiled and replied, "I vote for conscience." Just slightly changing the position of the words is a good pun. The response is quick and witty, and can be called a wonderfully humorous talent. Could this gentleman write "conscience" as a person's name on the ballot he cast? According to the plays, there are many lines referring to "conscience." For example, in the "Lotus Lantern," in the scene where Pan Xun interrogates the two sons, Liu Yanchang asks his wife Wang Guiying, "You see this up?" His wife replies, "Green heaven." Liu asks again, "Down?" Again she replies, "Spreading earth." Asks again: "Us as parents?" Again, the answer is "Based on the word conscience!" Again, like in "A Ladle of Snow", in the scene of reviewing the head, Lu Bing asks Tang Qin, "You look at this up?" Tang Qin replies, "Blue sky." He asks again, "Down?" Again, the answer is "Spreading earth." Again he asks, "Us officials?" The answer is, "Based on the word conscience." Again he asks: "If a person has no conscience?" Tang Qin paused slightly, answering, "Let big dogs eat them!" (There is often one more question and answer, which is changed according to the plot, and the body language, eyes and techniques are also different, you must experience it in the field to know its wonders. Now I won't go into detail.) I think these two representatives can also imitate the above two examples. The female representative asks, "You look at this up?" (You must point with your hand when saying this.) Representative Weng replies, "Green heaven." (You must look up when answering.) Asks again: "This down?" (You must point to the ground with your finger as you say it.) Again, the answer is "Spreading earth." Ask again, "Us voters?" The answer is, "Based on the word conscience." If you ask again, "If a person has no conscience?" Then what should be the answer below should be changed according to each person's situation and cannot be insisted on one way.</p>
