<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立法院委員互選院長·副院長辦法起草委員會，十四日下午三時半舉行第四次會議，出席起草委員卅六人，由端木愷主席，討論本日上午第三次預備會議交議之於立委互選院長。副院長辦法中增列改選院長·副院長條文案，預備會轉來之提案，共計二件：一爲黄宇人，喬鵬書，甘家聲等提請規定改選院長·副院長條款案，其增列之條文爲：「本院院長·副院長不稱職時，經委員十分之一以上之提議，出席人過半數之通過，得予以改選」。一爲吳望伋等提，擬請在原草案八項之後，加下列一條案，其增列之條文爲：「院長·副院長如不稱職時，經全體委員五分之一以上人數之提議，出席委員三分之二之通過，得另選之」。由主席提付綜合討論，就「提議人數」。「通過人數」及「增列條文文字」三項，徴求出席委員意見，李文齋。簡貫三·彭爾康·王洽民·潘朝英等均先後發言。簡貫三主張不稱職字樣應予删除，因如何始謂之爲不　職，殊難解釋，同時爲養成議長之公平正義起見，應取法英國議長之風度，忘却黨派立場，以議會爲前提，將來改選院長·副院長時，亦盼以此件爲不成文之規定，爲衡量之標準。彭爾康·溝朝英等發言，均主張應求立院局勢之安定，不可隨時發生倒院長。副院長之風潮，如把政潮帶到立院來，將使立院本身亦陷入不安定之境，故主張提請人數及通過人數均有較週密之規定。最後通過在「立法委員互選院長。副院長辦法」第七條後，加「第八條」條文爲：「本院院長。副院長經全體委員五分之一以上人數之提讓，出席委員過半數之通過，得予以改選」。原第八條「本辦法經大會通過後施行」則改爲第九條，此項增列之條文，定十五日提出第四次預備曾議討論，並推定胡庶華報吿，四時廿分散會。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕民選立委聯誼會，頃發表聲明，就靑年黨立委候選人聲明所指陳者，提出數項異議。民選立委之聲明，係經蘇·川·湘·鄂·冀·遼等省市立委八十餘人所同意者，彼等申述：（一）彼等部份爲無黨籍，部份爲國民黨　名修補者，競選時絕未獲黨部支持，僅憑個人社會信警，獲選民支持而當選，絕非配票結果。靑年黨立委候選人謂此次立委選舉，全係國民黨及政府配票產生，至少犯以偏蓋全之錯誤，且有汚損立委當選人信　及汚辱選民人格之娥。（二）立委應爲多數人民信賴推戴，經合法選舉而當選。靑年黨候選人聲明一再稱三黨協定，保證名額，已失民主政治常軌，而候選人不爭取選民，徒待國民黨之保證讓與，巳屬可異，即有所謂配票，各級選所亦均有靑年黨參加。各該候選人不能爭取選民，甚至在各級選所爭取配票，亦不可能？（三）立委選舉結束已將四月，若果有所謂配　，靑年黨候選人爲愛護憲法尊崇民主，自應早予揭發，今不此之圖，直待保證分配之名額不獲實現，始惡聲相向，殊不能使人無疑疑於純爲私利而發。行憲伊始，自當實行多黨政治，但政黨發展，自有其應循之常軌，若民意代表而期待之於配給，則必爲民意所不取，若因配給不得，反唇相議，更非政黨風度所宜有。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立法院議事規則起草委會，十四日下午三時許開三次會議，繼續分章逐條討論議則草案初稿，除第八章「同意權之行使」又經長時激辯後，加推包華國，孫桂籍，劉不同，祁志厚，吳望伋，陳博生等六人參與主稿之七人小組綜合會衆意見，重行修訂及其他一二條亦交小組作文字之斟酌外，餘均經修正通過，然尚須俟十五日下午三時及下午八時，小組委會與起草委會四次會硏擬議決確定後，方可提出預備曾議討論。十四日會議由召集委員　樹文主席，甫經宣吿開會，即續續　昨對「同意權之行使」方法之辯論，主張於同意權行使前瞭解總統所提行政院長人選之用人者，爲包華國，劉明侯，朱惠淸，楊玉淸，彭醇士，劉不同，孫桂籍，孫述樵等。與彼等持反對意見者，爲鄭彥棻，陣海澄，戴修駿，趙珮，張度楨，陳博生，陳顧遠等，雙方旗鼓相當，爭持不下。前者仍堅特決不能毫無根據；毫無一理由仿行使同意權，對總統所提行政　畏人選不唯應知其爲何許人，其所持主張如何及任用何等人行其主張，亦應事選瞭解。後者除仍強調是種主張於憲法無據外，鄭彥棻並就憲法條文答辯，包華國提出政院共同負責予是種主張之論據。渠認同意與監督是兩部分憲法，第五十五條僅規定行政院長如何任命為政院成立前之事務，至第五十七，五十八兩條文係規定政院共同負責乃在政院成立以後。正反雙方，激辯逾兩小時，雖維持原案之主張遭否決，然修正文字之爭持仍未稍息，終不得結果，直至五時半方加推委員參與主橋小組，將第八章全章各條重加修訂。第九章「聽取報告與質詢」，除質詢之提出不得辯論或推斷事實之規定略經討論，決議交小組修訂文字外，對質詢是否可於某種情况下，得拒絕答復一點，亦經爭辯後方確定允於爲保守國防秘密或有關國際約束時可不提出答覆。第十章「複議」，第十一軍「議事錄」均無何特殊親定。第十二軍「秩序」對「出席委員先行退席者不影鄉法定人數之計算」一條規定，若干委員認爲不妥。許蟠雲主張中途退席者偵在塲人數不足法定開議人數時，經委員提議淸査人數為實後，應即停止討論。陳博生主張可仍繼續討論，但不得表決。最後決定交小組修訂。第十三章「委員會會議」順利通過。第十四章「附則」最後一條「本規則由本院會議通過施行並咨送總統公布之」之後半删除，確定議事規則本身不必制成法律。最後葉溯中復提委員資格審委會組織及院長副院畏選舉辦法兩部分是否列入議則問題，以各委員咸認不必而未議。至七時廿分始行散會。</p>

<h3 id="c18">項國統治聖地結束以後 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>一九四入年五月十四日午夜，從巴勒斯組政府大優裏傳出一聲悠長的笛聲，宣佈英國統治巴勒斯坦三十年的歷史吿一段落。英方在海發舉行結束委任統治的儀式之後，所有駐在聖地的軍警均已集中海發，準備撤退回國了；同時，新興的猶太國也將於十六日正式宣吿成立。照常理說，聖地的解放與新猶太國的誕生，都是中東步入新時代的前奏，値得世人額手慶幸的。但是，在事實上，猶太人與阿刺伯人却仍在聖地演出爭奪耶路撒冷——台拉維夫公路的慘劇；而且這幕慘劇勢將愈演愈烈，阿刺伯聯盟各國也有被捲入漩渦的危險。聯合國大會雖然仍在紐約成功湖畔討論巴勒斯坦問題，但是其唯一的結果，祗能任命一個聖地斡旋委員會，對於分治計劃旣已束之髙擱，對於美國所提託管建議，也不能有所決定。此在華府方面，雖然也非常重視中東局勢的新發展，杜魯門總統一再召見馬歇爾國務卿，共商對策，看情勢，也討論不出什麼萬全之計，至多恐祗能向聯大建議，由聯大任命一巴勒斯坦專員，負責斡旋猶阿衝突，如此而已。所以從今天起，英國的統治雖吿結束，但是聖地仍將戰亂不已，可能蔓延而成中東燎原的烽火！</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦問題，雖然是一個宗敎和民族分歧的問題，但若沒有外來的因素參雜其間，則問題究竟單純，自不難覓獲合理的解決。老實說，巴勒斯坦自交黨國統治三十年來，猶阿雙方發生衝突，迄今未止，而且惡化到此程度，實爲强權政治鬥爭所造成的惡果。英國統治巴勒斯坦，一直採取「分而治之」的政策，不僅不設法調處雙方的衝突，使其和平相處，反而處處利用猶阿衝突的矛盾，故作依違，而自處於舉足輕重的地位。所以巴勒斯坦問題三十年來未能解決，英國外交當局多少應負其責。</p>
<p>至於美國，對於巴勒斯俎問題，也似乎始終沒有一貫的政策。在第二次大戰結束之初，美國的態度，顯然偏向猶太人方面，主張巴勒斯坦應實行分治，並在暗中贊助猶太人的復國運動。但是到了最近，美國對於分治計劃忽又改變態度，而主張將巴基斯坦付諸託管了。其原因有二：一是地理的因素。因爲巴勒斯坦的面積不大，若分劃而爲猶阿兩國，則此二國均不能具備現代國家　有的條件；此與印度實行印回分治，實不能同日而語。二是國際的因素。因爲美國主張分治計劃，引起了中東阿剌伯各國的反感，美國如若堅持分治計劃，　實行不可，勢必激起阿剌伯各國人民的反美情緒，適足以倔成　刺伯各國的投入蘇聯懷抱，而美國在中東却擁有巨大的利益，尤其是中東的石油事業美國投下大批的資金，如不能博得中東阿剌伯各國人民的友好，則美國在中東的利益勢必首受打擊。因此美國便不得不放棄分治的計劃，而另行主張託管。但是聯大對於美國所提出的託管建議，顧忌太多，又討論不出一個適當的辦法來，因此徘徊瞻顧，至今還沒有下文。目下祗能決定組織一斡旋委員會，調處猶阿衝突而已。</p>
<p>但是解決巴勒斯坦的先決條件，宵在促成雙方的停戰。在本月初，美國也想走這一條道路，曾向猶太人阿刺伯人提一個停戰方案，其辦法爲：（一）聯合國特別大會休會十天，暫停討論巴勒斯坦問題；（二）猶阿變方在聯大休會期間應發出全面停戰令；（三）英國將原定五月十五日結束委任統治一事延緩十天；（四）由杜魯門總統派專機一架，載運猶阿雙方代表及聯合國耶路撒冷停戰委員會美，法，比三國委員至巴勒斯坦，談判停戰，並於十天內提出報吿。這個方案一經美國提出，就遭到猶阿雙方的拒絕。我們從運休戰的四項辦法看來，總覺得美國的主觀太深，其中尤以延長英國統治的時期爲最不妥當，旣非猶太人阿刺伯人所能間意，亦非英國當局所能接受。故今後美國若欲提出在何休戰辦法二必先考慮這個辦法是否爲不倚不偏同爲猶阿雙</p>
<p>擺在美國前面的可能解決辦法，在原則上只有三種：（一）仍維持原來的分治計劃而加强或修正實施的方法；（二）放棄分治計劃而組織一個統一的獨立的巴勒斯坦國；（三）對巴勒斯坦暫時實行託管。這三種可能的辦法，在理論上，都能言之成理，但是在實際土都有困難。關於第一種，美國爲顧全中東阿刺伯各國的友好起見　似決不願再唱分治的主張。關於第二種辦法，所謂統一的獨立的巴勒斯坦國，必然是以阿刺伯人居於優越地位的國家，猶太人的合法利益絕無保陣，不僅猶太人要表示反對，就是其他各國，也不會表示贊成。關於第三種，實行託管，就等於委任統治，不要說猶阿雙方要反對，就是英國也不願「火中取栗」，再代人受過。要之，巴勒斯坦局勢的日趨惡化，足以導成中東的燎原烽火，美國旣不能規避現實與責任，就得採取積極有效的措置，務使中東的烽火不致蔓延開來！</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕據柏林英官方發言人稱，蘇聯外次馬里克十三日離柏林飛倫敦轉往紐約，蘇外交部要員洛巴坦柯同行。馬里克此一突然之行，已引起倫敦方面之種種揣測。馬里克前　任駐東京大使，爲蘇聯有數的遠東問題專家，傳馬氏此次突然赴美，負有有關朝鮮問題之緊急使命。馬歇爾國務卿昨日之談話曾指出朝鮮柏林及維也納爲美蘇摩擦之三關鍵，曾與馬里克有　接觸之英專家莫不認馬氏爲蘇聯最幹練少壯外交家之一。然接華盛頓來電，國務部發言人表示就國務部所知，馬里克之赴美，不過爲參加蘇聯駐聯合國之代表團。發言人拒絕評述馬氏此行，係與仙美最近交換意見有關之可能性，但曰，馬氏之赴美護照，係於美國發動與蘇交換時局意見前即已聲請。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕據倫敦「晚報」駐柏林記者之報導稱，昨日有行踪詭秘蘇專使兩人自柏林啓程飛往紐約，其中一人名馬里克，人稱爲「莫洛托夫私人代表」，彼等此行之任務甚爲詭秘，彼等途經倫敦時留於機塲貴賓室內，拒絕接見任何人。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕莫斯科發表　洛托夫與史密斯大使換文內容之動機，始終尙爲一謎。觀察家揣　蘇聯此舉，具有三種作用：（一）離間美國與西歐之關係，以阻撓馬歇爾方案之進展，及美國對西歐聯盟之支持。（二）正當美國會討論軍事撥款及軍事支援西歐聯盟之際，使美國之輿論陷於惶惑不解的狀態。（三）使全球共黨得有宣傳資料，指美國拒　蘇聯的和平建議，使人相信　前緊張局勢　由美國負　。莫斯科電臺發表　洛托夫聲明全文及史密斯聲明一部份之時間，尤堪玩味。斯科電臺係於晚間發表，故華　頓或歐洲之官方反應，至早當於次晨始能獲得，且發表之時，又適在史密斯大使離莫斯科赴法國渡假後不久，其意顯然在使美國或美大使無立刻解釋之機會。故在美國得有聲明之機會以前全世界均已知　蘇聯已在冷戰　光　動　平矣。就此點言</p>

<p>男二百公尺接力兩組稱覇馬華隊成績一分五七秒六</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日各項游泳節目，分上下午舉行，上午三項節目中，以男子二百公尺自由式接力預賽成績特佳。茲分述比賽過程如下：</p>
<p>女子一百公尺仰泳預賽　分二組舉行，每組取四名，第一組爲馬華黃碧霞所得，第二組則爲十四歲之廣州小選手鄭燕瑛取勝，鄭游來次勢頗佳，惜年幼後勁欠足，成績略受影響，惟頗受觀衆讚賞，獲得滿塲　聲。</p>
<p>男子二百公尺自由式接力預賽　兩組均打破二分一秒一之全國紀錄，爲昨日大會之重大收穫·第一組爲馬華隊，成績一分五七秒六，第二組爲廣州隊，成績一分五九秒九。</p>
<p>第一組中，馬華與香港競爭殊甚激烈，賽來頗爲精彩。前兩人幾不分上下，最後一人馬華馮朝玉速度奇佳，超出七公尺之遙。馬華出塲人員爲張壽山，譚慶仁，陳能德，馮朝玉。香港隊爲蔡利恒，張咸林，劉帝炳，尤世坤。</p>
<p>第二組三次發令後，始入水，廣州自第二人後即居優勢，直至終點以三米之差戰勝海軍。廣州選手爲陳超常，蔡國慶，羅毓榮，吳年。海軍爲徐亨，吳恩慧，劉醒華，劉新民。印尼華僑因此次代表不足人數，未能參加、聞者咸表惜之，蓋印尼此次在短距離中，表現成績最爲優異，否則創造新紀錄，當亦無疑也。</p>
<p>男子一千五百公尺複賽　第一組於上午舉行，參加　五人，廣西陳傳　因半途退出，僅四人到達終點，香港劉帝炳以二十五分七秒五獲得第一，馬華關華溫第二，香港另一選手尤世坤獲第三。</p>
<p>下午游泳節目，按預定秩序舉行者有六項，其中以男子一百公尺自由式，及女子二百公尺自由式接力兩項決賽、成績特優，均打破全國紀錄。水球表演兩塲，因菲華廣州分別棄權，並未舉行，茲分誌各項競賽過程如次：</p>
<p>男子一百公尺仰泳復賽　分兩組舉行，每組取四名。第一組滬名將與印華小將鍾天生相値，免不了火併一番、惟轉身後，老王一路領先，以一分廿二秒完畢全程。第二組起賽，馬華馮朝玉自始迄終，獨佔優勢，到達終點時，拋落第二名菲華李番冷，幾達十公尺之遙，成績一分十七秒七，以上兩組成績均破大會紀錄</p>
<p>入水表演預賽　鐘嗚三下，入水表演比賽開始。註册者十四人，實到十名，一名中途棄權，故賽畢全程者共九人。昨天預賽，每人在低跳板上共跳八次，分基本式花式各四次。基本式分：（一）正面入水（正飛燕式），（二）跑動向前屈體入水（正鐮刀式），（三）立定反身入水，（反飛燕式），（四）立定向後屈體入水，（反鐮刀式），花式四種，由各人任擇自己得意傑作四種，賣力演出，憑在塲裁判　三人主觀所給之積分，計數多寡，而後定各人之名次。昨日參加之九員跳將中，馬華譚慶仁，最爲瘦長。此公跳水時，却身輕如燕，在跳板上跑來，步子快慢恰到好處。脚尖不輕不重，在跳板盡頭處一踩，一身舒展地飛起來，不偏不倚，成四十五度角入水，遠遠望去，活像蜻蜓點水。看得四座觀衆，掌聲雷鳴。在基本式中，這是昨天積分最高的一跳。瘦譚在幾個基本式理獲分纍纍，奠定了他預賽時冠軍的地位。海軍暢德興，軀體矮而結實，輪廓很美觀，和瘦譚適成對比。此公在練習時，幾佩正反飛燕式，眞像吃便飯樣的自然。誰料昨天上賽場時，最拿手的式樣，反而走了樣，幸而在正反鐮刀和正反騰一週等三個花式裏，撈回了不敗的積點。今天該多多加油，可與瘦譚一拼。廣州古家駒，身材適中，在四個自選的花色跳中，第二跳正反騰一週半，是昨天花色跳裏積分最高的一跳。上海老將汪安祥，已經發胖了，身段不及先前　靈活。陸軍少將鄧墨林，聽說六届全運得入水第三，戎馬生活之餘，重溫一番舊夢，想是缺少練習關係，挑的又偏是幾種吃力不討好的姿勢，預賽中忝倍末座，今天該加油一番，俾一顯英雄本色。</p>

<h3 id="c97">滬隊被罰停出塲錦標賽形勢改觀　足球決戰今僅一塲警察陸軍火併有關錦標得失警隊必全力以赴 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全運曾足球循環賽部份，自日前陸軍提出抗議，警察隊提出聲明後，錦標爭奪已遇暗礁，審判委員會昨特對此事詳加硏討，結果決定上海隊任意棄權，根據競賽規程，應予停止其出塲比賽之處分，上海隊在循環決賽中所得之成績，一律不計。此項決議公佈後，循環賽局面已完全改觀如下：</p>
<p>單位已賽　勝　負　和　勝球　得分</p>
<p>警察　二　〇　〇　一　一只　一分</p>
<p>香港　二　一　〇　一　三只　三分</p>
<p>陸軍　二　〇　一　〇　〇只　〇分</p>
<p>此中受影響最大者厥爲警察與陸軍兩隊，各失兩分。今日港滬之戰，因上海資格取消，港隊輪空，該隊即將純恃前次兩戰所獲之三分，與警察角逐冠軍，至警陸兩隊原應於明日下午二時在田徑塲遭遇，惟警察隊以十六日大會即吿閉幕，已購妥機票，全體隊員定十六日上午飛返廣州，勢難參與上述規定時間內之比賽，故經大會重行決定，將該塲提前至今日下午四時舉行。警隊今日如能勝陸軍，則分數即與香港隊相等，冠軍之能否獲得，當視其勝球是否可超出二比〇之數，否則又將與港隊雷同，勢必再生糾葛。至陸軍前提出之抗議，昨業經大會正式退回，今日該隊之勝負，將直接決定冠亞兩軍誰屬，舉足重輕，殊堪重視。</p>
<h3 id="c98">足球落選賽　京鄂之戰發生紛擾 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>隊員侮辱裁判被取消比賽資格</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕足球賽昨祗有兩塲落選賽，海軍以二比〇勝菲華，南京以一比〇克湖北。京鄂之戰，上半時京隊先進一球，下半時終塲前兩分鐘，鄂隊隊員燕振章及朱雲濃兩人不滿裁判朱權判決越位，致起紛擾，未能終塲，鄂隊被判棄權，遂以一對〇草草結束。事後朱權向大會提出報吿，指鄂隊侮辱裁判，經審判委員會議決取消議隊本屆足球比賽資格，並判燕朱兩人不得參加下屆大會足球競賽。綜觀落選賽部份，現祗餘海平、四川，南京三隊角逐，海　軍今日下午四時在逸園遭遇、海軍制勝希望較大，如海隊能敗　川，明日上午十時則將在田徑塲再戰南京，此　吿終，落選賽冠軍即可順利產生。</p>
<h3 id="c99">兩艘南國快艇拋卻上海慢車　千五百米自由式陳震南佔優勢男百公尺吳傳玉再破全國紀錄 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>入水表演，整整花費了一小時又十分，緊接着又是疲勞轟炸，一千五百公尺自由式複賽第二組登塲了。</p>
<p>看看名單，還好有兩艘南國快艇陳震南，黃金華參加，輔以天津高幹兒羅金龍，上海慢車黃運森，一共四人，泳畢半程，陳震南拋却黃羅兩人，已達七十五公尺。陳的絕對優勢，和黃運森的落後，使冠殿軍大勢早已確定。成問題的，是小黃和老羅兩個，誰也不賣誰的帳，形影相隨，再加兩人換氣時，一個向左，一個向右，正好面面相覻，把彼此間的進度，看得一乾二凈，以致全池卅次來回，幾乎從頭火併到底。最後五十公尺，究竟小黃年輕力壯，猛不防他還留得一股變勁，備最後衝刺，老羅終被打垮，落後五公尺。回頭慢車黃運森，還在那裏慢條斯理的划呀划的，誰也數不淸他究竟落後了幾圈。不過他敗不餒，發令先生居然在他最後的一圈時，對準他頂門放了一槍，慢車活像剛升火，加速地完畢了全程。起身時，上海的觀衆，一樣的報以熱烈的掌聲。他代表上海，上海缺少游泳健將，至少這點運動精神，是値得讚賞的。</p>
<p>男子一百公尺決賽　這是昨賽中最引人注目的一個項目。舉行時，已近五時，氣溫已降至七十度，幸而水溫經過日晒，仍維持在七十六度左右，一共七人參加競賽，印華黃廠備，因病放棄了，預複賽時成績最優的印華吳傳玉，實力最強。香港劉帝柄，上午參加千五百公尺自由式複賽，雖得了首組第一名，實力不免分散，但仍抱一拚決心。此賽印華吳傳玉，兪順道，分佔兩道邊綫，帝枘居中。槍聲一響，傳玉順道下水最快。其餘幾乎不分先後，爭取這一剎那的時間。祇見七條水道上，被七條混江龍，翻得白浪滔滔，水花分飛。五十公尺轉身後，傳玉節節佔先，帝柄緊隨不輟，馬華馮朝玉未甘落後，迎頭趕上，其餘諸子，手不停揮，力戰到底。結果傳玉仍以二公尺之差，壓倒帝柄，首先衝到終點，成績一分三秒三，與他複賽中最優的記錄相等，縮短全國紀錄達二·四秒。有人說，帝柄和傳玉相差不遠，成績當也打破全國紀錄。不過二名記時員，衹有一位，所記的時刻，不能正式承認。</p>
<h3 id="c100">女二百米接力泳　香港人魚成績奇佳　二分卅五秒六打破全國紀錄 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>女子二百公尺接力賽祗有香港，台灣，上海三隊參加，臨時改爲決賽。香港人魚黃婉貞，黃婉生，曾鳳羣，高妙齡全體出動，冠軍「篤定」，大家想看，全國紀錄究竟要被刷新到怎樣的程度。首棒黃婉貞，槍發第一個入水，游畢五十米，已佔先六公尺之遙。一一棒婉生，繼續不懈，一百公尺後已領先十餘公尺。三棒曾鳳羣，四棒高　　，個個施展混身解數衝刺到底成績二分卅五秒六，打破全國紀錄，縮短時間達三·二秒。拋却台灣姑娘們，已將四十公尺。香港人魚們，全體自始至終，全部自由式，整齊美觀。台灣姑娘，身體個個黑黝黝的，看來殺博結棍，比起香港人魚，不免相形見絀。但較上海小姐們，實力仍是高出一等，終算搶了個亞軍。昨天上海隊游來，眞是洋洋大觀，首棒尤惠霞，游的自由式，二棒張杏燕，游的仰泳，將到池壁時，又怕碰了頭，離池兩公尺時，就停下來，划到池邊，三棒黃宗英，也是仰泳，四棒劉天　，却游了蛙式，全程包羅萬象，式樣自由寫意之極，終算硬幹到底，反正季軍是無人與爭的，與首名比比，將落後八九十公尺了</p>
<p>男子四百公尺複賽　分兩組舉行，每組取四名，時候已近黃昏，每組祗得五人參加角逐。第一組入水後，菲莊美道首先着鞕，一路領先，百公尺處曾與港將尤世坤一度競爭，二百公尺時，莊已佔優勢，終於領先到底，拋落二名港黃金華達十公尺，成績六分四秒六。第二組又是港將陳震南的天下，無人與爭，以五分五十秒七泳畢全程。劉帝柄連續作戰，精疲力竭，落得個第四名，險些兒被淘汰。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　洪絮才</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕本年度產生的「新美人魚」中，除香港的黃氏姊妹外，還有廣州的一對鄭氏姊妹，在本屆全運會中初露鋒芒但却早已一鳴驚人了。</p>
<p>鄭燕瑛十四歲，鄭雪瑛十三歲，但妹妹却較姊姊長得高，也比較結實。游泳到現在，不過一年，而有如此驚人的成績，令人不得不相信這是天賦的才能。</p>
<p>門口小河好玩</p>
<p>鄭氏秭妹去年肄業於天津慈惠中學初中二，說得一口好國語，記者問她們：「誰敎你游泳的？」她們搖搖頭答：「沒有人敎，我家鬥口有條小河，看見人家都游得很好，就跟着他們划呀划的，慢慢就會了」</p>
<p>去年五日間，父親帶她們去參加廣州游泳團，指導蘇大謨認爲她們確是可造之才，便悉心加以訓練。剛巧去年鄭氏姊妹因全家遷居廣東南海鄕下，誤了上學時間，便暫吿停學。這反造成了她們充分練習游泳的機會。</p>
<p>她們父親每天早晨八點鐘，親自陪着這兩個女兒，乘划子到廣州游泳團練習，一直到下午五時回家，雖然來回途上就需耗費四小時，但是　從不間斷。一年來成績突飛猛進，其速度足是以驚人的。</p>
<p>觀衆一見瘋狂</p>
<p>燕瑛專仰游，雪瑛游蛙式，各有各的特長。游泳開幕第一天，雪瑛參加二百公尺俯泳預賽，得了第二名。昨天燕瑛參加一百公尺仰泳預賽，得了第一名。同游道中，她們年事最小，身材最矮，然而躍入水中，動作敏捷，姿態美好，一時觀衆的鼓掌和喝彩，近乎瘋狂。十四歲的燕瑛，一出水就被成人羣包圍攝影和簽名，顫抖的小手，還寫得一手好字呢！</p>
<p>十三四歲的小女孩，而有如是驚人的成績，確是不可多得的人材。深信若是能够假以時日，她們必可爲運動界放一異彩！</p>
<p>得標雙喜臨門</p>
<p>本界新美人魚黃婉貞，黃婉生，自贏得冠軍以後，得意非凡，每天笑口常開，而其中尤以婉貞最爲興奮愉快。原來婉貞因此獲得了到美國念書機會。昨據黃氏姊妹的母親吿訴記者：婉貞性喜音樂，且有志赴美求深造，即她父親呢？却主張把女兒送到英國去，因而父女意見相特不下。做父親的，因爲婉貞糾纏不淸，便許了一個願：「假如你這次參加了全運，能够打破全國記錄，那我就答應你到美國去。」如今，婉貞旣然馬到成功，奏着凱歌歸去時，她理想的實現，自當指日可待了。</p>
<p>爸爸媽媽都好</p>
<p>她爸爸得到婉貞成功的喜訊後，特地拍了一個賀電來。對於女兒的行秘，也早經統盤籌劃。今年秋天，他準備帶婉貞先到英國去，讓她去見識倫敦世運會，然後再送她到美國讀書。</p>
<p>婉貞的媽媽表示：雖然女兒刷新了全國記錄，但是這個成績並不理想，她將　着婉貞姊妹繼續苦練，絕對不准有一分　氣或自滿。讓我們期待這對幸運兒的更燦爛的光芒吧！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕網球男女錦標決賽，昨日上午男子單打徐煒培（港）棄權於葉觀雄（穗），王文正（警）棄權於陶冠球（警），網球塲之視綫，遂集中於下午男子雙打循環決賽。疲勞決賽，循環不已，一個球員，上午要舉行單打決賽，下午要雙打決賽，精力有限，忙不開來，所以徐煒培王文正之棄權單打，全力應付雙打，不失爲聰明辦法。</p>
<p>男子雙打決賽陶冠球王文正大戰五盤，擊敗印尼陳立超李文宣，劇戰三小時之久，表演精彩，驚險百出、勝負之分，常在千鈞一髮之間，幾百觀衆，坐立不安；陳立超李文宣可勝不勝、陶冠球王文正後來居上，此賽不失爲昨日一塲主要精彩節目。另一塲香港徐煒培潤培昆仲四盤勝馬華謝羅伯林善振，三比一勝來較爲容易。雙打冠軍將決於陶王與兩徐之一戰。男子單雙打循環決賽昨日結果列下：</p>
<p>男子單打循環賽</p>
<p>葉觀雄（穗）勝徐煒培（港）　徐棄權</p>
<p>陶冠球（警）勝王文正（警）　王棄權</p>
<p>男子雙打循環賽</p>
<p>李文宣陳立超功虧一簣</p>
<p>陶王陳李兩組，可謂勢均力敵，旗鼓相當；陳立超陶冠球當然最佳，表演亦好，抽擊攔殺，妙球迭見，要不是李文宣的年青經驗不够，火氣大，觸網自殺累累，陳立超一組早巳得勝。陶冠球亦然如此，王文正精疲力竭，跑不動，一再觸網失分，否則陶冠球組亦早已獲勝。陶王兩人全憑經驗足，資格老，會在難解難分中，有時妙球突出，另闢生路。陳立超强力對抽，攻擊陶冠球之反手，陶竟爲之屆服，惜乎李文宣搭配太弱，功虧一簣，數百觀衆，爲之可惜。</p>
<p>上塲第一盤即成膠着狀態，印尼組連下三局，警察組亦回敬四局，印尼組奪得二局，五比四再居先。陶王造各五平手，再得二局，七比五第一盤分勝負，已經好不容易。經過一盤大戰，王文正已露不支狀態，於是二三兩盤，印尼陳立超李文宣，大施壓斃，六比三，六比四，輕易連取兩盤，二比一後來居上，一般觀衆，以爲勝負之勢已分，可無問題。不料休息再戰，第四盤陳李以三比二居先，因李文宣之鏘誤百出，竟連失三局，扳回一局，成四比五後，第十局陳李將一　寳貴之「得局點」奉送。四比六，成各二盤平手，第五盤決戰，陳李聲勢一振，以五比三佔優勢，決勝之一局，一再「平等」後，決定勝負之「得盤點」「得勝點」一分，陳李又輕輕失落。可勝不勝在塲觀衆，爲之嘆息。五比五，六比六，七比五，警察組陶王卒獲最後勝利。</p>
<p>謝·林勇而亂·二徐秦凱</p>
<p>二徐對馬華謝林之戰，謝林勇而亂，攔殺抽擊，球無把握，軟弱不能制勝，守旣不足，遑論進取。六比四，六比四，失落二盤後，徐氏昆仲大意，馬華兩將以八比六，奪回一盤，第四盤徐氏昆仲又以六比二得勝。</p>
<p>女子單打循環賽</p>
<p>女子雙打循環賽</p>
<p>兩塲女子單打·一鬆一緊</p>
<p>女子單打楊渭濱勝陸元春，輕鬆之至。第一盤連勝四局，負二局後，又獲二局、第二盤楊連下六局勝一光盤，楊渭濱穩得女子單打冠軍無問題。</p>
<p>陳金石上塲，第一盤以猛力長抽，六比一大敗朱芝英。第二盤朱針對陳金石不善奔跑之弱點，　以長抽短削時遠時近之球進攻果然以六比四扳回一盤第三盤朱芝英首勝一一局，可惜不能鎭靜，終遭敗北，惟昨日朱芝英失敗，表演確實相當精彩，已竭盡其全部精力。</p>
<p>女子雙打決賽兩組，實力縣殊，已成　印爭奪冠軍之局面。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕女子籃球循環賽第五幕，印尼逢福建，昨日下午二時於體育館開賽。兩隊在循環賽中戰績福建一勝一負，印尼則兩戰皆北，但按諸室外表演，印尼原爲極　異之一隊，經連日更番比賽對地板作戰，漸感習慣，該隊　以制勝之速度傳遞，遂得發揮，而全隊聯絡亦顯較對手爲　。福建始終落後，僅賴聚才</p>

<p>玉瑛斜射落網</p>
<p>兩隊接</p>
<p>觸　印　前　環攻，秀麗先中，心喜鑽入第下托入一球，各二平手。秀麗再度射入、金宋犯規，心喜兩罰皆吿中的，成四比四、秀麗表演出色隻　揮入，玉瑛在右角斜射破網。福建僅由麗湘罰得一分，第一節印尼以八比五佔先。</p>
<p>聚才連取三分</p>
<p>第二節福建林智慧入替陳麗湘，印尼亦以素卿換出桂馨，黃桂英犯規，素卿罰球不中，秀麗人長，伺伏籃下趁勢起接球托入，聚才怒從心起、迎　帶罰連取三分，智慧射中，十比十，福建追成平手。</p>
<p>林土娘上塲，陳蘭英下野，素卿連中兩球，心喜突入籃底投中，杏娘犯規，聚才罰得一分，十四比十三局面緊張，秀麗籃下擲入，聚才亦中一球，十六比十五，玉瑛再入塲調下素卿，秀麗又中，第二節十九比十六，福建仍居下風。</p>
<p>秀麗籃底立功</p>
<p>第三節福建何瑞卿調出黃桂英，印尼桂馨再入換下素卿。桂馨左角站定射中，秀麗籃底再建功，二十五比十六，何瑞卿赤足作戰，聚才一擲兩罰，追成二十六比二十。玉瑛兩破籃圈，聚才近籃投中，三十比二十二，結束第三節。</p>
<p>杏娘五次犯規</p>
<p>末了一節，素卿再調出桂馨，福建黃桂英亦換出何瑞卿，陳麗湘也赤足奮戰，秀麗托中，心喜報以遠射，印尼李杏娘五次犯規罰出，陳蘭英遞補，心喜罰中後再投入一球，三十二比二十七。時間尙餘四分鐘，雪娥拉手，秀麗罰中，許心喜林土娘雙犯規，均未罰中，心喜獨力帶球運至籃下投入，戰至三十五比三〇，秀麗籃下接得傳球，躍起托入，三十七比三〇。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕男籃落選賽，十四日有兩塲爭決賽權，首塲暹華對安徽，二塲哈爾濱對河南，四隊均勢均力敵，故戰來甚爲緊張。暹華對安徽一塲，比分尤爲接近，至最後三分鐘始爲暹華拉出，結果五十比四十五，暹華獲勝。</p>

<h3 id="c112">今日女籃奪後座上海應勝菲一籌 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　錢昌年</p>
<p>〔本報特稿〕今日女籃奪標戰，上海對　律賓，下午二時在體育館舉行。上海隊　能獲勝，即可榮登籃球后座、菲隊雖已負於　建一次，今日如能擊敗上海，對　標仍有一綫希望。</p>
<p>我以爲無論在心理上，狀况上，甚　戰略的運用上，滬隊都　右較多的聯面條件。</p>
<p>就心理的條件而言，菲隊能勝不能敗，加以經驗不足——對　建之戰，便是在這個原因之下覆師的——，而上海的黃明媛等，俱是馳騁球壇有年的老將，比較能够鎭定地運用頭腦；何况上海有一條猛銳的鋒綫先來一個下馬威，一挫菲律賓的　氣，就可以　對　於慌亂之境，而削弱她們的次戰匪力。</p>
<p>其次，以狀態來說，目前的上海隊够得上攻銳守堅之稱。前鋒　宗蘭，黃明媛，俱有拍球深入敵籃、隻手投入的純熟技巧。三個前鋒的射籃率，也皆穩定在極高的水準綫上。後衛皆有交替釘人的默契，甚少漏洞，而且長力充足，朱錦雲尤爲出色，以她來釘煞菲隊獲分之鑰的楊秀枝，當可勝任，這一着可以减損菲隊的得分。</p>
<p>菲隊的守衛並不如何堅不可破，滬隊三鋒都有平均獲分可能，石宗蘭的罰球太嫌生疏，好在關係微細，不致影響大局的。</p>
<p>在戰略的運用上、上海隊不妨將鋒衛劃分成兩個作戰機構，後衛專負責縛束菲隊前鋒的活動，尤其是楊秀枝，務須全力釘煞，前鋒則專司努力獲分之責。，菲律賓要想贏球，除非滬隊守衛無法制止菲隊前鋒的活躍，造成得不償失的局面，以細微的差數敗下陣來，事實上，這個可能性極小，上海隊的守衛，我們寄予期望與信任。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕台灣對湖南及上海對廣州之女排循環賽，昨下午續在市體育塲舉行，結果台灣以二比一戰勝湖南，上海則直落二壓倒廣州。</p>
<p>首局之戰，雙方戰略互有得失，惟湖南則比台灣棋高一着，這一着便是湖隊靈魂鄭培坤（頭排左），由於她的快壓速扣，使合灣首負一盤。</p>
<p>二局開始，第一隻球就引起　列戰鬥，爭奪殊久，湖南不善持久之戰，首先失分，此後湘方頭排左翼亦屢屢失地，台灣二排右大舉進攻，連連扣擊，終於台灣以廿一對十之懸殊扳回了一局。</p>
<p>到第三局，雙方屢成平手，技藝難分高低，例如台有楊玉兒之扣擊，湘則還以鄭培坤之速壓，湘隊發球雖佳，而台灣那位左手發猛球的陳華光亦不錯，到了八分平排後，湖隊以發球獲分，逐漸佔光。</p>
<p>台灣因輪而亂，至八（臺）比十一（湘）時，三排左右翼兩將竟成雙重疊，因搶球而失球，幸有楊玉兒於十一比十四時輪到發球，大顯威力，居然疊獲六分，湘隊爲之震驚，觀衆爲之喝彩，最後，台灣得了第三局，奏凱而歸。茲將兩塲戰况分誌於次：</p>
<p>台灣羅　倪　楊玉兒　高靜雅</p>
<p>陳錦喜　江桂枝　張月色</p>
<p>顏秀英　陳美玉　陳華光</p>
<p>湖南鄭培基　秦本澤　陳純秀</p>
<p>劉興珩　曾育媛　廖志强</p>
<p>鄭培坤　劉蘊珊　劉竹蘭</p>
<p>上海逢廣州事實上已是冠軍戰殿軍，實力　殊，戰來毫無勁道。首局開始，滬隊發球，一直連贏了十五分，實打破此次任何排球賽之紀錄。結果滬隊以廿一比四得了第一局。及至二局，滬隊以贏來全不費力，未免　敵，所以一度被對方趕至平手，但最後仍以廿一比九之數再勝一盤，定了天下。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕女子壘球賽，昨晨有二幕在大會田徑塲舉行。首戰上海對甘肅，滬隊實力較强，着着佔先，至第四局領前十分時，以爲勝劵在握，遽將正選球員六人調下，俾其他選手俱有登塲之機會，原意本不應苛責。孰料甘肅突發奮圖强，乘滬隊稍露驕態，陣脚未穩之時，傾師進攻，二度造成滿壘之局勢。最後三局，滬隊錯誤頻頻，竟被迫成各十七平手；最後幸賴程慕闌擊出一分，始得免與甘肅同背黃包裹。甘肅諸將，球藝雖無若何特長，然作戰精神，始終如一　，實足爲各隊法；其球技再經磨　，不難成爲勁旅客也。</p>
<p>第二戰廣東仍一貫鋒鋩，以八比五擊退南京。粤隊僅餘今晨對甘肅一戰，當不難取得長勝榮銜，壘球后冕，已成囊中物矣。</p>

<p>陸軍少將表演跳水「飛毛腿」仰泳成名</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕各項游泳成績迭破記錄，游泳池邊的觀衆，人數也天大在創造新記錄。大門口的門崗雖然森嚴，各式閒雜人等却自有方法混進來，跳水表演時，跳板兩旁，尤其人頭擁擠，司令台上乃不得不宣佈　停舉行而請軍警肅淸附近的閒人，致原定十四時十分開始的跳水表演，直到十五時十分才得繼續。</p>
<p>在僵持的當兒，麥克風中播出報告員洪亮的聲音：「裁判不能工作，無法舉行表演，請跳板右邊的觀衆讓開。」此時看台上有人鼓掌，有人大噓，更有人怪聲叫好。</p>
<p>有幾位不夾加　水的選乎坐在旁邊另一條架於半空中的跳板上觀看，居高臨下，非常寫意，却不料擋住了後邊看台上觀衆的視綫，被他們一致噓了下來。跳水表演的成績未見精采，缺少美人魚參加尤不能饜足衆望，加以兩塲水球表演，又都臨時棄權，散塲時，聽到一位先　在　氣：「倒霉！化了四十萬，只哂到了一天太陽。」</p>
<p>姿勢的好壞由三位裁判員評判，每人各備漆有一至六號碼的長柄木板六塊，每一次表演後，他們各擎出一塊來表示他們給予的分數。但三位裁判員的意見極不一致，有一次兩人各評二分，另一位却評五分，觀衆都哄笑起來。</p>
<p>參加表演的陸軍選手鄧墨林是少將階級，報吿員特爲之鄭重介紹。</p>
<p>男子一百公尺仰泳複賽第一名馬華馮朝玉，兩足自大腿以下全是累茸茸的毛兒，可稱爲名符其實的「飛毛腿」。</p>
<p>女子二百公尺接力賽香港隊打破全國記錄，黃氏姊妹花的母親笑容滿而的走過來告訴她的女友：「又打破記錄了。」</p>
<p>黃氏姊妹花，高　齡，曾鳳羣等四位接力賽冠軍，從水中起來後，攝影與要求簽名的紛至沓來，有應接不暇之勢。她們身上還是濕淋淋的，正在尷尬的時候，人叢中「殺」進來香港領隊，才將她們護送出重圍。</p>
<p>一位仁兄請她們在他的運動帽的「鴨舌頭」上簽名後，向他的友人吹牛說：「我這帽上全是衆香國裏的芳名。」言下不勝　意。</p>
<p>看台上有人從欄杆中攢出想爬下來，司令台上立刻高聲制止，報吿員先說：「看台上的人不要跳下來」，繼而又幽默地加一句四川話：「硬是要不得！」觀衆報以大笑。</p>

<p>平靜月餘之物價，近來又起劇烈波動，一般物價，大多漲百分之五十以上。政府當局，已於十三日起，採取有效措施，以期遏止漲風，安定民生。前日國家行局有一萬二千餘億之鉅額差進，並決定繼續抽緊銀根。除配售物資而外，另拋售大批物資，食米，麵粉，棉紗，食糖等繼續拋出。今日尙有稅款徵收，仍將　額着進。前日銀根因突轉緊俏，不少行莊，有延至深夜十二時以後始軋平者。昨日物價受此壓迫，已吿回小，平均在二成左右。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次物價漲風猛烈，當局決採取有力措置，以資平抑。惟外傳行局停止貸款一節，負責人士表示不確。昨日物價已吿回跌，據有關人士之觀察，今後數日內銀根將更緊。</p>

<p>米市在民調會之不斷拋售下，已呈供過於求之象。昨民調會續在南北二市拋售，計南市拋早稻，價爲五百四十五萬，惟去化寥寥，僅售出二百六十石。北市拋出白粳及秈米，白粳價五百五十萬，秈米五百三十萬，共售出五千二百石。自由交易價因銀根緊，各物小，貨主求售而去化呆，暗中跌落二三十萬元。白粳薄稻五百六十萬，早稻五百五十萬，二市到貨五千九百七十石。</p>
<p>麵粉因中信局繼續聯合各廠拋售，各脾粉價减低十萬，爲二百萬元送到。惟市價因銀根突緊，錫價報小，大戶傾吐，老車兵船自二百萬疾瀉至一百八十五萬元。紅蜂連成以一百八十萬收市，各跌二十七至三十萬之鉅。麩皮小十二萬，小麥廠盤跌入三百萬，爲二百九十五萬元。</p>
<p>雑糧</p>
<p>在銀根緊迫下，貨主脫貨求現，人心虛軟，客帮觀望不納。黃豆劇跌三十五萬元，苞米。菉豆因客帮不取，各傾跌四五十萬。紅糧挫落二十萬，揀靑交易零落，芝蔴缺乏受主，跌落四五十萬，生仁勁跌一百萬至一百二一二十萬元。</p>

<p>此六者之第二第六兩種與衆不同最易分辨。第一種注文稠密，筆畫　勁，以視四五兩種注文疏朗，筆畫柔細者亦復有別。第三種則字體頗不工整，筆畫粗鈍，最爲　劣。與其他數種相較，不難辨其美惡也。夫德國所藏之殘葉僅爲一紙，姑置不論；惟此十七紙所存旣多，是否同爲一書則不可無考。</p>
<p>茲先就其板式論之：第一種內「二〇一四」之第3紙所存上下二板爲東冬二韻字，首尾俱不完備。上一板係抄寫配葉，存後八行，末題「二板」。下一板與前一板相接、自第一行「虹」字始，至「　」紐止，爲木刻，凡十八行。而第六至第十七各行上部均有殘闕。案其所闕，正爲伯氏編號「四七四七」之斷片。原自一葉分裂爲二者也。自第十九行以下復爲抄寫配葉，凡十二行。合前共爲三十行。第二種「二〇一五」之第3紙爲二冬三鈍字，凡十九行，末題「三板」，與前一種下一板收字及注文全同，則二者當爲一書不同之刻本。前後所闕，適可相補。全板都爲三十四行。又第一種中「二〇一四」之第2579四紙板式字體如一，所存告爲上板之尾與下板之首，惟行數多寡不齊耳。第2一紙，照片之首尾不備，所存之行數似更稍多，不見原物，無由推度。其第8紙，存十五行，與第5紙同出於一板，固極顯明。此一二兩種之大較也。</p>
<p>第三種「二〇一四」之第4紙及「五五三一」之12兩紙所存亦爲上板之尾及下板之首。惟「二〇一五」之第2紙爲一整板，凡三十四行，與前二種每板之行數相同。</p>
<p>至於第四種「二〇一四」之第6紙但存二十七行，「五五三一」之第3紙則存三十四行，雖有殘損，確爲整板。而同號之第4紙，僅存後三十行，其首尙闕四行也。第五種「二〇一四」之第1紙所存爲一板之末十六行，「二〇一五」之第1紙則爲整板，凡三十四行。然則此五種字體雖不相同，而每板同爲三十四行之板式，則知之已審。</p>
<p>若夫此五種刻本之體製，乃又不盡同矣。約略言之：</p>
<p>（一）「二〇一四」之第3紙，「二〇一五」之23兩紙及「四七四七」一紙每紐之首皆訓釋列前，反切切後。例外甚少。</p>
<p>（二）「二〇一四」之2456789七紙及「五五三一」之12兩紙，反切或在訓釋之前，或在訓釋之後，爲例不純。然而每韻之第一紐反切在前實爲慣例（僅產韻爲例外）。</p>
<p>（三）「二〇一四」之1，「二〇一五」之1及「五五三一」之34紙反切一律在訓釋之前，毫無例外。</p>
<p>據是則此五種雕板，其板葉之行數雖同，而其體製　然有別，未可混同也。</p>
<p>今復就其內容尋繹之：第一第二兩稱東冬二韻行款內容相同，宜視爲一書，前已言之矣。若再與第三第四兩種合觀，其第一種平聲韻目之有數次者，爲二冬三十五豪五十一鹽，第二種爲二冬三鍾，第三種爲十虞十三佳十四皆十五灰，第四種爲三十一宣三十二蕭；依此推之，乃知此四種分韻之系統完全吻合。其平聲之韻次當爲：</p>
<p>1東2冬3鍾4江5支6脂7之8微9魚10處11模12齊13佳14皆15灰16哈17眞18諄19臻20文21殷22元23魂24痕25寒26桓27删28山29先30仙31宣32蕭33宵34肴35豪36歌37戈38麻39覃40談41陽42唐43庚44耕45淸46靑47尤48候49幽50侵51鹽52添53蒸54登55咸56銜57嚴58凡，都五十八韻。</p>
<p>此雖出於蠡測，然而惟其如是，第四種之宣始爲三十一　蕭始爲三十二，第一種之豪始爲三十五，而鹽始爲五十一也。否則若謂第一種與四種韻目不同，「齊」後有「移」，「仙」後無「宣」，「鹽」韻亦爲「五十一」，則與第三種之韻目不合，殆不然矣。又此韻目自三十五豪以迄五十一鹽之間乃依陸法言切韻之舊序排比而成，雖無實證，然以此類韻書之入聲目次仍與法言舊次相合一點觀之（詳後），則其平聲亦當本乎陸氏，不復有所更革也。如此論之設若不誤，則一二三四數種雖刻板不同，而韻目固無異焉。</p>
<p>至如第四種平入兩聲體製雖異，而一則平聲有宣韻（二〇一四6），一則入聲有雪韻（五五三一3）宣者仙之合口，雪者薛之合口，平入分類適能相應。考雪韻　紐下有絟字，注云：「細布。又至全反」。而宣韻詮紐下之絟字，訓釋旣同，且正音「至全反」。如此相合，當非無故，斯蓋兩種刻本同爲一系之書也。</p>
<p>若夫第四種之入聲一類及第五種體製固同，是否同爲一書，頗不易知。若以韻目數次觀之，即使非一書之兩刻本，而韻目亦必相合。蓋第五種入聲韻目之有數字者爲二十六洽二十七狎二十八葉二十九怗三十四德。恰韻之前又有盍韻字，則盍爲二十五；德韻之前復右職韻字，則職爲三十三。其數目如此，實唐本韻書中之僅見者。至於前後之韻目何如，又非藉第四種刻本無由推知。案第四種韻目之有數字者爲二十學十一錫二十二麥二十三陌。然此麥韻前復有昔韻字，昔爲二十一乎，則雪錫之數字不合；昔爲二十二乎，則麥陌之數字又不合。是雪錫及麥陌二者之數字必有一誤。今考之王寫　切　第三種（S．2071）及蔣斧頭所印之唐韻，其人聲錫昔麥陌之後均爲合盍洽狎葉怗緝　鐸職德業乏諸韻。若依此次推之，第五種三十三職之前當爲三十二鐸三十一藥三十緝；二十五盍之前當爲二十四合二十三陌二十二麥。麥陌兩韻旣爲二十二及二十三矣，則第四種麥陌二韻之數字，會當不誤。其誤蓋在雪錫二韻。復就雪韻以上之韻目考之，終亦不足二十之數。案孫愐唐韻自「屋」迄「薛」僅十七韻而已，若此刻本「質」韻後，有如夏竦古文四聲韻所據之韻書多一「聿」韻，則自屋迄薛僅得十八韻，雪韻之數，但爲十九，亦不得爲二十也。足證雪錫之數字有誤。今定雪爲十九，錫爲二十，昔爲二十一，則前後統序，無一不合矣。試擬其次如下：</p>
<p>1屋2沃3燭4覺5質6聿7術8物9櫛10迄11月12沒13曷14末15黠16鎋17屑18薛19雪20錫21昔22麥23陌24合（下接第四種之25盍26洽27狎28葉29怗。再下則爲30緝31藥32鐸33職34德35業36乏—凡三十六韻。）</p>
<p>此第四種之敍次旣明，而第五種之韻目亦得其敍。交相比證，二者正可　接。是四五兩種復爲一系之書也。</p>
<p>又此第五種刻本洽韻恰紐口洽反下有搯字，注云：「爪搯。亦作他刀反」。考之第一種「二〇一四」第8紙豪韻叨紐「他刀反」下正有搯字，反切守全相符。此雖戔戔小節，蓋絕非偶然。案豪韻他刀一音，切三作吐蒿反，項跋本及敦煌本王韻作土高反，項跋本及敦煌本王韻作土高反，宋跋王韻作吐高反，均不作他刀。此第五種與第一種平入反切竟爾如是相應，則二者亦係同類之書也。</p>
<p>綜此數事觀之，此五種不同之刻本，固非一書，然就其內容而言，其韻部之分合必同，殆無疑義。此事魏建功先生曩於民國二十年所作唐宋兩系韻書體制之演變一文（載國學季刊三卷一號）已曾道及矣。時伯氏「五五三一」數紙尙不爲人所知，至廿五年王有三先生始自巴黎寄歸照片，余乃得以錄副。去歲復承有三先生惠示伯氏「四七四七」之照片，與向之听有比類參校，更得證成師說，益信先生之卓識，誠不可及也。今復比擬此類韻書四聲之韻目如後：。平上去三聲</p>

<p>此平聲凡五十八韻，上聲五十六韻，去聲六十韻，入聲三十六韻，實爲今日所見讀書分韻之最多者。且其　部與　竦古文四聲韻所據之唐切韻最爲相近，當爲晚唐同系之韻書。惟夏目平聲齊韻後有栘韻仙韻後有宣韻，凡五十九韻，此有宣無移，故少一韻。入聲夏目有聿韻無雪韻，凡三十五韻，此有雪韻，故又多一韻。二者韻目略有參池，未爲全合。然夏目上聲有選韻，此平入有宣雪二韻，則此上聲蓋亦有選韻矣。且此刻本韻書韻目之反切，如虞遇俱反緩乎管反產所簡反銑先典反，異於切三王韻而與夏書相同，亦足證兩書之相近矣。然而此刻本之恭蜙樅三紐均在冬韻，夏書恭蜙等字則在鈍韻，一本於法言，一本於孫愐，是取裁間或有異耳。</p>
<p>往者王靜安先生嘗謂：「唐人韻書以部次觀之，陸法言切韻孫愐唐韻小徐說文解字篆韻譜夏英公古文四聲韻所據韻書爲一系」（見觀堂集林卷八李舟切韻考），其說是矣；若就韻類之分合而言，陸法言切韻之後，王仁昫切韻爲一類，孫愐唐韻爲一類，小徐說文篆韻　與古文四聲韻所據之韻書及此類五代刻本切韻爲一類。陸韻之韻部即本於南北朝諸家韻書而來，惟草創之初，容有分析未盡者，故自王仁昫以下，續有增加。跋韻上去二聲陸韻並缺，而王仁昫增之；眞寒歌三韻四聲之開合兩類，陸氏原爲一韻，而孫愐析之。寖假以至此類五代刻本之切韻，分別愈細，定類益嚴，推溯其始，皆　自王仁昫也。然則此書之題爲「大唐刊謬補缺切韻」，亦足以見其淵源矣。（民國卅七年四月一日）</p>
<h3 id="c137">印度文法理論的根本問題（上） <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 金克木</p>
<p>古印度波你尼仙人（Panini）的梵文典，即所謂「八篇書」，是占今中外沒有匹配的一部奇書。它不僅在時代上古到兩千幾百年以前，而且它的形式也縮到將近四千句的代數公式般的歌訣內容又包括了複雜的梵語變化的全部。關於「西域記」卷二中所提到的這位「聲明」大師其人，以及非短篇所能說明而平常語言書中又大半點到　這部書，我在此並不能多談，只想追究一下這位印度兩千餘年文法學的宗祖的文法系統所依據的理論的出發點，這也許對我們了解文法學乃至印度思想略有所助。</p>
<p>不過我仍得先簡單指出這部文典的特色。這可以分兩方面：其一，它沒有依語義分別詞品及句法，却只依語形由音變以分析字的構成與變化及　接。它只說明語尾變化（Accidence）與字的構成（Word-formation）。再加上　語所有的「連聲」規則。它的自身組織嚴密的文法系統是依據於只知有音的語言現象的觀察與分析。梵語所謂文法，「毗何羯羅拏」也便是分析之意。其二，它着重在當時標準高級通用語（bhasa）的確定，並不重在古吠陀語（Chandas）的解說，又受了以歌訣口語相傳的習慣的拘束，於是把由現象分析出的結果重新構造成一個特殊的邏輯系統，同時又隨了言簡意賅的最高原則而編成了迎半個音都難再縮减的一本口訣。讀者除已經懂得梵語外（這在著書當時是不成問題的），澴必須先了解它的特殊形式，再發現它的系統，然後可看出它實在是依據於長久的細密的對語言現象的分析。因此，它成爲一部極難讀的書，號稱須學十二年之久。</p>
<p>現在再簡單說它的系統：除了字與字間的「連聲」規則以外，它只是字的而不是句的分析。因此語尾變化與字，構成編在一起。對詞的性質也完全沒有依語義的邏輯分類，而只有依語形（音）的現象區別。字大別爲二，一是有變化的，一是無變化的。有變化的之中，初步變化是名詞尾與動詞尾，進一步是不分名動的字幹的構成這構成中的主要成分便是分析到最後的語根，即所謂「界」加在「界」上使它成爲字，或使它再表現出名詞動詞等所有的各種關係的都是「綠」。這兒便可明顯看出動詞的「綠」可以直接加在「界」上，而名詞的「綠」却總是在「界」已由別種「綠」加過，成爲各種名詞乃至形容詞，合成字，之後。很明顯的只有動詞的根才是究竟。依它的術說語，動詞的「綠」是「底」Tin動詞變化便是以「底」爲尾巴，即中國舊譯「底彥多聲」；名詞形容詞等的「綠」是「蘇」Sup它的變化便是所謂「蘇漫多聲」。不過它原來是並不管名詞動詞等字義區別，不論詞性，只分語尾的。</p>
<p>字的分析旣到了最後的語根，「界」，那麽，文法便是以「界」爲根本再建立成爲現實語言的規律。若就現象的分析說，「界」是結果，若就文法的系統說，它却是起點。梵文典所附的「界讀」即「語根彙解」是否可靠；波你尼用的方法及其所得結果，由現在人的知識與思想看來是否還有價値；等等問題，在近代歐美學者中仍是各派毀譽紛紜，此地更不能涉及。我只在略說以上的事實之後進究關於語根的理論。這理論正如前面所說，旣是文法硏究的結果，又是文法系統的起點。</p>

<h3 id="c142">儒與俠 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>韓非子五　篇及顯學篇都說戰國之世儒俠兩種學派最風行，而「儒以文亂法，俠以武犯禁」，大約說今日的話，就是要筆桿與弄槍桿的。那個時候，槍桿階級的代表者是　家，墨子主張非攻，亦即專門打抱不平，爲了實現其抱不平，就得蓄樍自己的實力，以爲「武裝調停」的準備，所以當公轍般爲楚造雲梯攻宋的時候，墨子就可以百舍重繭，一氣跑到楚國去給楚王一個威脅，經過近人的老證，知道墨子的徒弟是有組織的，力量很雄厚，直如宗敎團體一樣。</p>
<p>儒家可就不然了，根據胡適之的考證，設儒即是濡，懦等字的同義，有濡滯，緩慢，懦弱之義，所以正考父鼎銘才有一命而俯，再命而僂的話，充分表現了奴才調子。這話是否眞實，先不必講，儒者始終以帮閒的身分出現於歷史之中，則是事實。</p>
<p>可是皇帝們也正因爲這個看不起儒生，秦始皇比較不懂政治手腕，把那羣貌爲儒生而行同方士的怪物，弄到驪山之下，一下子坑了，惹得物議沸騰，成爲千古罪案；漢朝就不然了，有了叔孫通這種魯國的聖學傳人，當然把知識分子的心理硏究得萬分剔透，與其用快刀子殺，不如用麻醉劑，於是一個太學博士，就够劉歆之流拚了命去爭，一個微辟考試，就可以使董仲舒之流獻出其三年下帷的心得。好比丟下一塊肉骨頭，百犬搖尾，狺狺而爭，眞乃可笑可憐，試間宋元以來的科舉功名，與此又有什麼分別？其最大的不同，不過方法更完密，羅網更普遍罷了。</p>
<p>儒者爲了要表現自己，當然得排除「俠」，董氏之罷百家尊儒生，便是一個撒手鐧。漢初尙有肝膽照人的遊俠者流，如朱家郭解，對於劉邦創業，不無小補；但到武帝時，就把他們全部硃除，這樣一來，天子萬年，沒有什麽可以顧慮了，可是國家的元氣，也從此大受斵喪。</p>
<p>人類在未達到大同世界以前，總需要一種對立的安定，也就是說，社會上能够有多種力量存在，可以互相牽掣監視，必可以减少若千黑暗面，我們看三俠五義之類的小說，覺得很過癮，正代表社會上缺乏了這些殺貧刧贓偸富濟貧的壯士，水滸傳在社會上有那樣的魔力，也是由於此理，看蕩寇志便覺得充滿積鬱，一點道理都沒有了。儒者雖然在社會上竄取了獨占的地位與勢力，却往往被人民所鄙棄，不如俠客受人民歡迎，此無他，正因儒家自己的表現，處處是向沒落道路的原故。</p>
<p>孟子歌誦湯武，而罵桀紂爲一夫，也未嘗沒有俠的意味，只是傳統的學派相爭之見，常常把眞理的光明面阻暗，於是楊墨之說，遂大受排斥。後人不知發揚其革命思想，却專揀皇帝歡迎的尊君之說來嚼個不休，可謂　有此理之至！積破即久，到處都是濡滯懦弱的儒，不再看見剛强奮發的俠，君主與人臣沆瀣一氣，再加上宦官外戚，一定是天下大亂，民不聊生，歷史上事實是不遑枚舉的。似乎從前胡漢民先生曾作一文，謂中國有儒而無俠，是思想上一大缺點，今日視之，豈不令人重有所感乎？人民的苦痛，總要找一個機會發洩，如果平常能零零星星的解決，或者不至於像山洪潰堤，一發而不可遏，這也就是釜底抽薪的辦法。所以在民間充分發展俠的精神，（可不是峨眉劍俠傳那種，請勿誤會！）在讀書時多培養學生的正義感，也許是七年之病中的三年之艾吧？</p>

<h3 id="c144">一位美國總統的悲哀 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 雨窗</p>
<p>美國的大總統位高權重，日理萬幾，生活中竟無悠閑二字。橫逆之來，使你無從擺脫，而費盡心機四面應付之餘，也許祗招來了更多的是非。</p>
<p>美國故新聞界互子炣斯勞（H．H．Kohslaat），生前在政界頗有地位，極爲當時的共和黨人所推重，黨內重要決策，柯氏頗多參預機　者，而據柯氏說起來，大總統實在是可爲而不可爲的。</p>
<p>他有一天夜間到白宮去晋謁麥金萊總統，總統不勝悽涼地說：「這兩個多星期以來，我每夜從沒有能够睡滿三個鐘頭。議會裏面一定要逼我們向西班牙宣戰。事實上，西班牙的艦隊已經早就開進了南美洲古巴的領海了，而我們根本毫無準備，連到想在大西洋海岸開一開禮砲的軍火都沒有！」</p>
<p>總統說到此地，憂急交併，竟然像一個十幾歲的小孩一般地大哭起來！</p>
<p>柯斯勞靜默地把自己的手放在總統的肩上，一語不發，而總統却淚如泉湧，悲不自勝。慢慢的總統漸復原狀，柯斯勞想安慰他，就說：「在這非常時期，大總統採取任何措施，一定是能够到得全國擁護的。」</p>
<p>總統却不再作答。他祗抬起頭來，問柯斯勞：「我的眼睛紅不紅？別人會看出我剛哭過嗎？」</p>
<p>柯斯勞自覺不宜再用誑話敷衍，祗得承認大總統的尊目似乎略有淚光，</p>
<p>總統不安地說：「可是我現在馬上就要到我內人那邊去了，怎麽辦？」原來總統夫人正在隣室招待貴賓，裙屐如雲，總統自然也應當去招呼一下。</p>
<p>柯斯勞就進了一計。他勸總統走進隣室之前大大的「哼」一下鼻涕，聲音要響，要讓大家都聽得見，用力要足，要使眼睛裏因「哼鼻涕」而有一點眼淚！假裝傷風，大家就不起疑了。</p>
<p>柯斯勞靜靜站着，看總統莊嚴地站起身來，大步走進隣室—在門口微微一停，大大的「哼」了一聲，然後去招待賓客了……</p>
<p>可悲的是，麥金萊總統當時的心情雖已如此，而在這　事情之後不久，竟然還要死於一個刺客的槍下！</p>
<h3 id="c145">打與宣誓 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>宣誓這頑意兒，不知起於何種動機，其源流如何。在別國，我不知道；至於在我們大中華民國裏，則當然古已有之。在尙書裏有甘誓，湯誓，牧誓等文，不管其文之眞偽，而現在　之，則總覺得有些殺氣騰騰，打風虎虎，大致總是罵人家不是，該殺，該打！被殺被打者想也有大文說得冠冕堂皇，只因傳統關係，不便發表，故孔老夫子索性把它删去，一正人心。降及後世，此種宣誓風氣逐流行民間，變爲對神罰咒。衆好漢聚集酒樓中或枯廟內對神宣誓之後，接着定有殺得好和打得好的偉大塲面展開了。准此，誓字的副作用；大者是合夥厮殺，小者是暗打冷拳！</p>
<p>按誓字的解釋，據說文云，「約束也」。禮記曲禮亦說「約信曰誓」；疏謂「用言辭共相約束，以爲信也」。玩「共相」二字，宣誓並不是片面的行動。換句話說、要雙方情願，互相約束這才取得「信」，這誓才得有效力。像目今通行的宣誓，誓詞是只憑一方面單相思地　就的，要强人以必從；那對象呢，明知不誓不足以滿足私慾，於是也只好馬馬虎虎，亂誓一下，把什麽願受最嚴厲的處罰的這種具文，成爲小孩子的「油口傳」，有誰肯凜遵！</p>
<p>又按餐字从「折」从「言」。據六書統解釋這造字的用意是「以言折其罪也」。如何折，我有些不大明白。折字从「手」，从「斤」，斤是斧斤，是一種殺人或打人的傢伙。手執斧斤，高居「言」上，是可證誓是要用暴力來推翻空言的；不然，何必把「言」安在「折」下！</p>
<p>這次全運會開幕那天，節目中有運動員宣誓一項，在萬目睽睽之下，儀式相當隆重，但是接下來，連日據報載有選手大打裁判員等不幸事件也就在萬目睽睽之下公開演出。難道他們都沒有宣過誓麽？不，他們宣過的。但何以打局曾層出不窮呢？再三想來，只有怪這「誓」字造得太蹊蹺了！</p>

<p>英雄自然是偉大的。但在中國，述英雄的一切朋友和東西都是偉大的。英雄固然可以享受特權，而英雄的朋友，照樣也能來一手。至少，在情形尷尬時，報出英雄大名，萬事也全休了。我們常縣見許多人愛說：「某某待我如何，某某是我什麼人」之類，這些所謂某某，就是英雄們的大名，那些人天天掛在嘴邊，或者也就是提高自己身價之一法也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Election of the Legislative Yuan President and Vice President to be Held the Day After Tomorrow; Voting and Ballot Counting Procedures to be Decided Today; List of Preparatory Committee Members of the Control Yuan Announced <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 17th during the sixth preparatory meeting. The fourth and fifth preparatory meetings will be held separately at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM on the 15th. The procedures for the election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, as well as the voting and ballot counting procedures, will be passed at the meeting on the 15th to ensure that the election can be held legally on the 17th. The 16th is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The third preparatory meeting of the first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution was held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:40 AM on the 14th. 411 legislators attended, with Wu Tiecheng presiding. First, the Secretariat reported on the minutes of the second preparatory meeting. Then, the discussion of the "Draft Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators" began. Legislators spoke fervently. Many believed that the draft procedures should include provisions for the removal of the President and Vice President. Some legislators argued that the "Draft Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators" was a procedural law to resolve the current situation, not a law, and should be discussed at the formal general meeting. The two sides debated fiercely without reaching a conclusion. Finally, Huang Yuren and 29 others proposed a temporary motion, arguing that the draft procedures should include "Procedures for Re-electing the President and Vice President." The chairman put it to a vote. Of the 434 legislators present, 292 voted in favor, which was a majority. It was resolved to hand over the original draft to the "Drafting Committee for Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators" for revision. It was decided that the drafting committee would continue to meet on the afternoon of the 14th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The National Government issued an order on the 15th: Appointing Liu Zhe as the Chief Commissioner of the Preparatory Committee for the Inaugural Meeting of the First Control Yuan, with Li Chongshi, Zhu Zongliang, Tian Jiongjin, Gu Fengxiang, He Kefu, Ma Yaonan, Li Sichong, Zeng Dao, Zhang Weihan, Wang Xinling, Li Zhengle, Wang Guanwu, Yang Zongpei, Liu Yantao, Cao Haosen, Wang Xuan, Yan Zhuang, Guo Zhongkui, Chen Yiying, Xing Senzhou, Li Zhaohuan, Mei Gongren, Li Buwei, Chen Hanzhen, Qiu Niantai, Cui Shuyan, and Yao Yuanchu as members of the Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Control Yuan President Yu Youren has written to Chairman Chiang, requesting permission to retire. Chairman Chiang gave him three days to reconsider.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Amendments to Legislative Yuan President Election Method; Adding the Clause of "Re-election"; Draft Committee Passed for Discussion at Today's Preparatory Meeting <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Drafting Committee for the Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators held its fourth meeting at 3:30 PM on the 14th. Thirty-six drafting committee members attended, with Duanmu Kai presiding. They discussed the motion submitted by the third preparatory meeting that morning to add clauses for the re-election of the President and Vice President to the procedures for the election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators. There were two proposals forwarded by the preparatory meeting: one proposed by Huang Yuren, Qiao Pengshu, Gan Jiasheng, and others to stipulate clauses for the re-election of the President and Vice President. The added clause was: "If the President or Vice President of this Yuan is deemed incompetent, upon the proposal of more than one-tenth of the members, and with the approval of more than half of those present, a re-election may be held." The other was proposed by Wu Wangji and others, suggesting adding the following clause after the original eight items: "If the President or Vice President is deemed incompetent, upon the proposal of more than one-fifth of all members, and with the approval of two-thirds of the members present, a new election may be held." The chairman put it to a comprehensive discussion, soliciting the opinions of the attending members on the three items of "number of proposers," "number of approvals," and "wording of the added clause." Li Wenzhai, Jian Guansan, Peng Erkang, Wang Qiamin, Pan Chaoying, and others spoke in succession. Jian Guansan argued that the words "incompetent" should be deleted because it was difficult to explain what constituted incompetence. At the same time, to cultivate the fairness and justice of the Speaker, he should learn from the demeanor of the British Speaker, forget party positions, and prioritize the parliament. He hoped that this matter would be an unwritten rule and a standard of measurement for the re-election of the President and Vice President in the future. Peng Erkang, Gou Chaoying, and others spoke, all advocating for the stability of the Legislative Yuan and preventing the trend of overthrowing the President and Vice President at any time. If political tides are brought into the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan itself will fall into instability. Therefore, they advocated for more thorough regulations on the number of proposers and the number of approvals. Finally, it was passed to add "Article 8" after "Article 7" of the "Procedures for the Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan by Legislators": "The President and Vice President of this Yuan may be re-elected upon the proposal of more than one-fifth of all members and the approval of more than half of the members present." The original "Article 8" "These procedures shall be implemented after being passed by the General Assembly" was changed to Article 9. This added clause is scheduled to be submitted to the fourth preparatory meeting for discussion on the 15th and Hu Shuhua was designated to report. The meeting adjourned at 4:20 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Association of Elected Legislators Releases Statement of Election <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Association of Elected Legislators recently issued a statement raising several objections to the allegations made by the Young China Party's legislative candidates. The statement of the elected legislators was agreed upon by more than eighty legislators from Jiangsu, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, Liaoning, and other provinces and cities. They stated: (1) Some of them were non-partisan, and some were Kuomintang members who ran for office independently. They did not receive any support from the party headquarters during the election and were elected solely on the basis of their personal social standing and the support of voters. They were by no means the result of vote allocation. The Young China Party's legislative candidates claimed that the recent legislative elections were entirely the result of vote allocation by the Kuomintang and the government, which is at least an overgeneralization and is intended to taint the reputation of the elected legislators and insult the dignity of the voters. (2) Legislators should be trusted and supported by the majority of the people and elected through legal elections. The Young China Party's candidates repeatedly mentioned the three-party agreement and guaranteed quotas in their statements, which has deviated from the norm of democratic politics. It is already strange that candidates do not strive for voters but wait for the Kuomintang's guarantee and transfer. Even with the so-called vote allocation, the Young China Party also participated in election offices at all levels. How is it possible that these candidates cannot win over voters, and even cannot strive for vote allocation in election offices at all levels? (3) The legislative elections ended four months ago. If there was indeed any so-called vote allocation, the Young China Party's candidates should have exposed it earlier out of love for the Constitution and respect for democracy. Now, they did not do so, but waited until the guaranteed quota was not realized before they turned against each other with harsh words. This cannot help but raise doubts that it is purely for personal gain. At the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, a multi-party political system should be implemented. However, the development of political parties has its own established norms. If representatives of public opinion expect to be allocated, they will inevitably be rejected by public opinion. If they turn against each other because they did not receive the allocation, it is even less appropriate for a political party's style.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Ma Hongda's Remarks in Lanzhou: Optimistic About the Northwest War Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Correspondent, 14th] Ma Hongkui arrived in Lanzhou on the 13th, met with relevant leaders, and received dental treatment. He is scheduled to return to Ningxia within the week. Ma expressed great optimism about the war situation in the Northwest. He claimed that the bandit troops suffered heavy losses in the Lin You Mountain area, almost to the point of total annihilation. They will definitely be unable to spy outwards again in the next three to six months. However, the Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi bandit troops have been fiercely attacking western Henan in recent days. Their intention seems to be to echo the bandits in northern Hubei and southern Shaanxi. The National Army has long been aware of their plot and has made effective deployments. He praised the Longdong Army Corps for their effective killing of bandits, calling the Binzhou campaign the greatest victory since the suppression of bandits. Unfortunately, the Ningxia Army Corps had not yet come into contact with the bandits when they arrived from Sanbian, and the bandits had already collapsed and fled. Regarding the establishment of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Ma said that it has become a thing of the past, and he is old and weak and has no intention of taking on senior official positions again. If he can serve his hometown, he will be satisfied. Also, Ma Ji, Secretary-General of the Qinghai Provincial Government, took a children's song and dance troupe to Longdong on the 13th to comfort the troops.</p>

<p>[Our Xuzhou Correspondent, 14th] Frequent victories have been reported from the front lines in northern Jiangsu. After Zhang Xuezhong's unit recovered Funing, they continued to deploy troops along both sides of the Tongyu Line to sweep south and north. According to a phone call from the front lines in Funing, as of the morning of the 14th, they have successively recovered the strongholds of Beisha (northwest of Funing), Dongkan (northeast of Funing), Goudun (south of Funing), and Chenyang Banhu on both sides of the Tongyu Line. There are no bandits within fifty miles of Funing City, and the county magistrate has entered the city to work. Exiled people from Funing in the Xuzhou and Huai'an areas are returning home in droves.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The National Government ordered: Xie Xiaoliang, Commissioner of the Eighth Administrative Inspectorate District of Henan Province; Zhang Longwen, County Magistrate of Neixiang County, Henan; Yu Jinjiang, County Magistrate of Wen County; Wang Bingjun, County Magistrate of Qi County; Zhan Jianxin, County Magistrate of Luoning County; Dong Guoyan, County Magistrate of Cai County; Ren Cigang, County Magistrate of Boai County; Wang Kaiji, County Magistrate of Mianchi County; and Gao Qinming, County Magistrate of Runan County, led teams to suppress bandits, defended their territory with loyalty, and generously sacrificed their lives. It is a pity and should be commended to show loyal spirit. In addition, Mu Yuntian, County Magistrate of Daming County, Hebei Province, participated in the War of Resistance, making many contributions. Later, he worked in the local area, led teams to suppress bandits, defended his territory with loyalty, and eventually died in action. It is a pity and should be commended to show loyal spirit.</p>

<p>[Our Macau Correspondent, 14th] The military is redeploying in the Fujian-Guangdong border area, and troops are being transferred frequently. Bandit commander Liu Yongsheng and his chief Chen Ducai took the opportunity to operate. On the 9th of this month, they gathered more than 300 bandits armed with six light and heavy machine guns at Dalue Mountain in Pinghe, preparing to disrupt the border area on a large scale. The National Army learned of this and sent a large force to suppress them. They encountered the bandits in Niaolong Pit and fought for four hours. The bandits suffered more than 70 casualties, and Chen Ducai was killed on the spot. We captured two machine guns and many documents. Six officers and soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Chairman Chiang summoned Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, and others to his official residence at 9:00 PM on the 14th to inquire about the situation of the talks on resolving the issue of the quotas for the Democratic Socialist and Young China Party legislators. The Chairman also expressed his hope that this matter could be resolved as soon as possible. Lei Zhen took a night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM that night to exchange views with people from the Democratic Socialist and Young China Parties in Shanghai. Also, Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Wang Shijie, Lei Zhen, and others discussed the issue at Wang Shijie's residence at 11:00 AM on the 14th. It is reported that regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist and Young China Party legislators, under the premise of full cooperation between the Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, and Young China Party, the path to resolution will still be sought from the existing number of legislators. Efforts will be made to allow the Democratic Socialist and Young China Party legislators to reach a certain number as soon as possible, and the remaining numbers will be supplemented gradually. It is hoped that the legislators who have already been elected by the Democratic Socialist and Young China Parties will attend the Legislative Yuan meetings first.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, and Yu Jiaju of the Young China Party arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 14th and immediately convened a Central Standing Committee meeting to discuss the issue of legislative elections and the future three-party cooperation methods. The meeting adjourned at noon and continued at 8:00 PM. When asked about the party's attitude towards the legislative elections, they said that it had not changed.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Military News Agency: This time, when Peng Dehuai's bandit troops invaded southward from northern Shaanxi and harassed central Shaanxi, the cavalry of Ma Jiyuan's unit of the Longdong Army Corps bravely fought the enemy and achieved rare brilliant results in the suppression of bandits over the past year, turning the situation in the Northwest from instability to stability. It has been learned that Chairman Chiang has telegraphed an order to allocate 500 million yuan in bonuses to encourage them.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Correspondent, 14th] The area bordering Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei provinces is becoming tense again. The bandits who were driven north by the Henan National Army from Jingziguan, and the Kong Congzhou bandit troops, about two brigades, who fled west from Xixiakou, have all fled to Xiping. One unit has fled into Fushui Pass, ten miles east of Shangnan County, Shaanxi, and there are attempts to continue westward. About two brigades of bandits in Yunxi, northern Hubei, fled into Xigoukou in Zhashui County, Shaanxi, and are engaged in fierce fighting with our local teams.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Correspondent, 14th] The remnant Peng Dehuai bandit troops who fled from Gansu into Shaanxi number only 7,000 to 8,000. One unit of about 5,000 fled into Malan and threatened to raid Sanyuan and Jingyang. The remaining unit fled through Heshui towards the central county. Our teams are cooperating with the National Army to encircle and suppress them in separate routes.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The National Army in Henan recovered Dengfeng County on the morning of the 13th and captured a large amount of supplies.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] After the recovery of Biyang and Tanghe, the National Army in Nanyang has launched mobile attacks. The National Army is now advancing victoriously to the southwest and is engaged in a fierce battle for Xinye. In addition, the bandits who crossed the Han River from Yun County and attempted to flee to Wudang Mountain have been blocked near Baliping.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Air Force here dispatched a strong formation today to attack western Nanyang, killing more than 100 bandit soldiers in Deng County. They also annihilated many bandits between Neixiang and Zhenping.</p>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Correspondent, 13th] Henan Chairman Liu Mao'en has been suffering from leg problems recently and has not received guests for a week. On the 13th, he specially met with this newspaper's reporter. In extreme pain, Liu responded to the reporter's questions about the aftermath of the fierce battles in western Nanyang, stating that the four counties of Zhenping, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Deng County in western Nanyang are not only strong fortresses in the southwest of the province, but also important military bases in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Shaanxi provinces. The bandits have paid heavy sacrifices over the years without breaking through. Their ambition to destroy the local armed forces in western Nanyang and spy on Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei has not died. Judging from their troop movements, it is known that they will launch another fierce attack on western Nanyang with a stormy momentum. At that time, the central government was repeatedly telegraphed, requesting that a large army be dispatched to defend the area. However, before the elite troops arrived, the bandits had already entered the house. The teams fought a bloody and arduous battle with 150,000 bandits with inferior equipment for nearly ten days. The tragedy and fierceness were unprecedented. It was not until the ammunition was exhausted and no reinforcements arrived that they were ordered to transfer to Hubei. As a result, all four counties in western Nanyang fell into the hands of the bandits. It is hoped that the supreme command will quickly dispatch a large army to encircle and annihilate them while the bandits are still catching their breath, remove the butcher's knife from the heart of the four provinces, and shatter their dream of spying on Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Drafting Committee of Legislative Yuan's Rules of Procedure; Heated Debate on "Exercising the Right of Consent"; Decides to Form Another Six-Member Subcommittee to Revise <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan's Rules of Procedure held its third meeting at around 3:00 PM on the 14th to continue discussing the initial draft of the rules chapter by chapter and article by article. Except for Chapter 8, "Exercising the Right of Consent," which was again the subject of lengthy and heated debate, and six people, including Bao Huaguo, Sun Guiji, Liu Butong, Qi Zhihou, Wu Wangji, and Chen Bosheng, were added to the seven-member subcommittee responsible for the main draft to integrate the opinions of the public and revise it, and a few other articles were also handed over to the subcommittee for textual consideration, the rest were passed after amendments. However, it will still have to wait until the fourth meeting of the subcommittee and the drafting committee at 3:00 PM and 8:00 PM on the 15th to deliberate and decide before it can be submitted to the preparatory meeting for discussion. At the meeting on the 14th, the convener committee member Qian Shuwu presided. As soon as he announced the start of the meeting, he continued yesterday's debate on the method of "exercising the right of consent." Those who advocated understanding the president's choice of candidate for Premier before exercising the right of consent were Bao Huaguo, Liu Minghou, Zhu Huiqing, Yang Yuqing, Peng Chunshi, Liu Butong, Sun Guiji, and Sun Shuqiao. Those who held opposing views were Zheng Yanfen, Chen Haicheng, Dai Xiujun, Zhao Pei, Zhang Duzhen, Chen Bosheng, and Chen Guyuan. The two sides were evenly matched and could not reach an agreement. The former still insisted that they could not exercise the right of consent without any basis or reason. Not only should they know who the president's candidate for Premier is, but they should also understand what his主張how and who he employs to carry out his主張how. The latter, in addition to still emphasizing that this kind of主張how has no basis in the Constitution, Zheng Yanfen also responded to the constitutional provisions. Bao Huaguo raised the argument that the cabinet is jointly responsible for this kind of主張how. He believes that consent and supervision are two parts of the Constitution. Article 55 only stipulates how the Premier is appointed as a matter before the establishment of the cabinet. Articles 57 and 58 stipulate that the cabinet is jointly responsible after the cabinet is established. The two sides debated fiercely for more than two hours. Although the proposal to maintain the original plan was rejected, the dispute over the revised text did not subside. In the end, no result could be obtained until 5:30 PM, when committee members were added to the main bridge subcommittee to revise all the articles of Chapter 8. In Chapter 9, "Hearing Reports and Inquiries," except for the provision that the submission of inquiries shall not be debated or inferred from facts, which was slightly discussed and decided to be handed over to the subcommittee for revision, the point of whether inquiries could be refused to be answered under certain circumstances was also debated before it was decided that responses could be withheld for the purpose of preserving national defense secrets or related international obligations. Chapter 10, "Reconsideration," and Chapter 11, "Minutes of Proceedings," did not have any special親定. In Chapter 12, "Order," some committee members considered the provision that "the number of members present who leave the meeting early shall not affect the calculation of the quorum" to be inappropriate. Xu Panyun advocated that if the number of people present is less than the quorum for the meeting when a member leaves midway, the discussion should be stopped immediately after the number of people present is checked at the proposal of a member. Chen Bosheng advocated that the discussion could continue, but no voting should be allowed. In the end, it was decided to hand it over to the subcommittee for revision. Chapter 13, "Committee Meetings," was passed smoothly. In Chapter 14, "Supplementary Provisions," the second half of the last article, "These rules shall be implemented after being passed by the meeting of this Yuan and sent to the President for promulgation," was deleted, and it was determined that the rules of procedure themselves do not need to be made into law. Finally, Ye Suzhong raised the question of whether the organization of the Committee for the Review of Member Qualifications and the election procedures for the President and Vice President should be included in the rules of procedure. Because the committee members all believed that it was unnecessary, it was not discussed. The meeting adjourned at 7:20 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e18">After the End of British Rule in the Holy Land <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>At midnight on May 14, 1948, a long whistle sounded from the Government House in Palestine, announcing the end of thirty years of British rule in Palestine. After the British held a ceremony in Haifa to end their mandate, all military police stationed in the Holy Land have been concentrated in Haifa, preparing to withdraw back to their country. At the same time, the emerging Jewish state will be formally proclaimed on the 16th. Logically speaking, the liberation of the Holy Land and the birth of the new Jewish state are both preludes to a new era in the Middle East, and are worthy of celebration by the world. However, in reality, Jews and Arabs are still staging tragedies in the Holy Land to compete for the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway; and this tragedy is bound to intensify, and the Arab League countries are also in danger of being drawn into the vortex. Although the United Nations General Assembly is still discussing the Palestinian issue at Lake Success in New York, its only result can only be to appoint a Holy Land Conciliation Commission. The partition plan has been shelved, and no decision can be made on the trusteeship proposal put forward by the United States. In Washington, although they also attach great importance to the new developments in the Middle East situation, President Truman has repeatedly summoned Secretary of State Marshall to discuss countermeasures. Looking at the situation, they may not be able to discuss any foolproof plan. At most, they may only suggest to the UN General Assembly that the UN appoint a Palestinian commissioner to be responsible for mediating the Jewish-Arab conflict. Therefore, from today onwards, although British rule has come to an end, the Holy Land will still be plagued by war, which may spread and become a prairie fire in the Middle East!</p>
<p>Although the Palestine issue is a problem of religious and ethnic differences, if there are no external factors involved, the problem is ultimately simple, and it is not difficult to find a reasonable solution. To be honest, since the Kuomintang government ruled Palestine for thirty years, the conflict between Jews and Arabs has not stopped, and it has deteriorated to this point, which is the evil result of the struggle for power politics. British rule in Palestine has always adopted a "divide and rule" policy, not only failing to find ways to mediate the conflict between the two sides, so that they can live together peacefully, but instead using the contradictions of the Jewish-Arab conflict everywhere, pretending to be ambivalent, and placing itself in a pivotal position. Therefore, the British diplomatic authorities should bear some responsibility for the failure to resolve the Palestine issue for thirty years.</p>
<p>As for the United States, it seems that it has never had a consistent policy on the Palestine issue. At the beginning of the end of World War II, the attitude of the United States was clearly biased towards the Jews, advocating that Palestine should implement partition, and secretly supporting the Jewish Zionist movement. But recently, the United States has suddenly changed its attitude towards the partition plan, and advocated putting Pakistan under trusteeship. There are two reasons for this: one is the geographical factor. Because Palestine is not large, if it is divided into two countries, Jewish and Arab, neither of these two countries can meet the conditions of a modern country; this cannot be compared with the implementation of Indian-Pakistani partition in India. The second is the international factor. Because the United States' advocacy of the partition plan aroused the resentment of the Arab countries in the Middle East, and if the United States insisted on the partition plan, it would be impossible to implement, and it would inevitably arouse the anti-American sentiment of the people of the Arab countries, which would be enough to instigate the Arab countries to join the Soviet Union, and the United States has huge interests in the Middle East, especially the American investment in the Middle East oil industry. If it cannot win the friendship of the people of the Middle East Arab countries, then the interests of the United States in the Middle East will inevitably be hit first. Therefore, the United States had to abandon the partition plan and advocate trusteeship instead. However, the UN General Assembly has too many concerns about the trusteeship proposal put forward by the United States, and cannot discuss an appropriate solution, so it hesitates and has not yet made a decision. At present, it can only decide to organize a conciliation commission to mediate the Jewish-Arab conflict.</p>
<p>However, the prerequisite for solving the Palestine issue is to promote a ceasefire between the two sides. At the beginning of this month, the United States also wanted to take this path, and proposed a ceasefire plan to the Jews and Arabs. The methods were: (1) The United Nations Special General Assembly adjourned for ten days and suspended the discussion of the Palestine issue; (2) The Jewish and Arab parties should issue a comprehensive ceasefire order during the adjournment of the UN General Assembly; (3) The United Kingdom will postpone the end of the mandate, which was originally scheduled for May 15, by ten days; (4) President Truman will send a special plane to transport representatives of both Jews and Arabs and the American, French, and Belgian members of the United Nations Jerusalem Ceasefire Committee to Palestine to negotiate a ceasefire and submit a report within ten days. Once this plan was proposed by the United States, it was rejected by both Jews and Arabs. Looking at the four methods of transporting a ceasefire, we always feel that the United States' subjectivity is too deep, especially the extension of the British rule period is the most inappropriate. It is neither agreeable to the Jews nor Arabs, nor acceptable to the British authorities. Therefore, if the United States wants to propose a ceasefire method in the future, it must first consider whether this method is impartial to both Jews and Arabs.</p>
<p>The possible solutions facing the United States, in principle, are only three: (1) to maintain the original partition plan and strengthen or amend the implementation methods; (2) to abandon the partition plan and organize a unified and independent Palestinian state; (3) to temporarily implement trusteeship over Palestine. These three possible solutions can all be justified in theory, but there are difficulties in practice. Regarding the first one, in order to take care of the friendship of the Arab countries in the Middle East, the United States seems to be unwilling to advocate partition again. Regarding the second method, the so-called unified and independent Palestinian state is bound to be a country in which Arabs occupy a superior position. The legitimate interests of Jews are by no means guaranteed. Not only will Jews express opposition, but other countries will not express approval. Regarding the third type, the implementation of trusteeship is equivalent to a mandate. Not to mention that both Jews and Arabs will oppose it, even the United Kingdom is unwilling to "take chestnuts out of the fire" and suffer for others again. In short, the deteriorating situation in Palestine is enough to lead to a prairie fire in the Middle East. Since the United States cannot avoid reality and responsibility, it must take active and effective measures to ensure that the fire in the Middle East does not spread!</p>
<h3 id="e19">Allied Forces' Policy of Supporting Japan; General Labor Union Sends a Telegram to Protest; Firmly Insisting That Aggressive Forces Should Be Thoroughly Destroyed <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 14th] The National Federation of Labor Unions held its first temporary meeting of directors and supervisors on the 13th, and resolved the following important cases: (1) Expressing a solemn attitude in a telegram regarding MacArthur's policy of supporting Japan, (3) Telegraphing the Secretary-General of the British Transport and General Workers' Union to express approval of his proposal at the World Federation of Trade Unions, (3) All provincial and municipal general labor unions and national federations of industrial labor unions will, in the future, submit documents to the central competent authorities through the general union for review and transfer. The telegram sent by the association to Marshal MacArthur is as follows: To Marshal MacArthur, Honorable Sir, Japanese militarism and financial groups are the forces that destroy world peace and trample on the Far East. Therefore, the Allied governments repeatedly stated before and after Japan's surrender that they should be thoroughly destroyed. However, in the past year, the Allied Forces have repeatedly violated the original policies of the Allied countries, and the policies towards Japan have gradually changed. Among them, the abandonment of the Far East Commission's Document No. 230 plan, allowing financial groups to rise and rearming Japan, is the most worrying. China has been invaded by Japanese aggressors for as long as seventy years, and Chinese workers have suffered even more. Therefore, our country's five million organized workers cannot but raise a serious protest against the Allied Forces' policy of nearly sowing the seeds of aggression. Chinese workers sympathize with the Allied Forces' efforts to raise the standard of living in Japanese industry, but the current measures have exceeded this limit. The consequences will not only make Japan a terrible aggressive force in the economic field, but also become Germany after World War I in the military field, and have the possibility of making a comeback. This association, on behalf of China's five million workers, protests to the Marshal, and hopes that the Marshal can accept the opinions of the people and governments of the Allied countries and make corrections. This is our sincere prayer.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Regulations on Banning the Sale of Imported Luxury Goods; Ministry of Economic Affairs Sets Implementation Date for August 1 <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 14th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted regulations for banning the sale of imported luxury goods, which will be implemented simultaneously nationwide from August 1. These regulations were drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs based on the outline of the "Strictly Enforce Economy and Save Expenses" method, and are the draft measures for banning the sale of imported luxury goods. The original plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, and once approved, it will be prepared for implementation as scheduled. The regulations stipulate that the luxury goods to be banned include items that are prohibited from import and temporarily suspended from import, but domestic goods are not included in the ban. For all banned items that still remain on the market after the announcement of these measures, they should be allowed to sell them off quickly on their own. If they are not sold out by the end of July 1948, they will be punished in accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing National Mobilization" once they are found, and they will be confiscated. This work will be managed by the Social Affairs Bureau in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, and by the county (city) governments in counties (cities). From August 1, 1948, the local police agencies will be convened or supervised to conduct general inspections or spot checks of stores, stalls, or other markets for buying and selling goods. Items seized should be sealed on the spot or sent to the competent authority for inventory and safekeeping. The competent authority should appraise them within five days. Those that are deemed not to be banned items or are domestic goods should be unsealed or returned immediately. The appraisal work will be carried out by an appraisal committee for banned items organized by the competent authority inviting three representatives from the local commodity tax bureau, the council, and the relevant trade association, who will be responsible for appraisal and make a record of the appraisal for future reference. If it is determined that they are indeed banned items, the appraisal personnel should be responsible for sealing them up and reporting them to the superior authority on a monthly basis for transfer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for future reference. If there is any theft, replacement, or shortage, they should be severely punished according to law. Confiscated items, if no appeal is filed after thirty days have passed since the delivery of the punishment order, the competent authority should periodically invite local public opinion organs and various organs and legal entities to jointly verify the type and quantity of goods before publicly burning them, and report to the superior authority for transfer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for future reference.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Molotov's Trusted Advisor, Malik, Suddenly Flies to America, Carrying a Secret and Important Mission; Gromyko to be Recalled to Moscow <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] According to a British official spokesman in Berlin, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik left Berlin on the 13th and flew to London en route to New York, accompanied by Lobatenko, a key member of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. This sudden trip by Malik has aroused much speculation in London. Malik, formerly the Soviet ambassador to Tokyo, is one of the Soviet Union's leading experts on Far Eastern affairs. It is rumored that Malik's sudden trip to the United States is related to an urgent mission concerning the Korean issue. Secretary of State Marshall's remarks yesterday pointed out that Korea, Berlin, and Vienna are the three key points of friction between the United States and the Soviet Union. British experts who have had contact with Malik invariably regard him as one of the Soviet Union's most capable and promising young diplomats. However, a dispatch from Washington stated that a State Department spokesman said that to the best of the State Department's knowledge, Malik's trip to the United States was merely to join the Soviet delegation to the United Nations. The spokesman declined to comment on the possibility that Malik's trip was related to the recent exchange of views between the United States and the Soviet Union, but said that Malik's U.S. visa application was made before the United States initiated the exchange of views with the Soviet Union on the current situation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] According to a report by the "Evening Standard" correspondent in Berlin, two mysterious Soviet envoys departed from Berlin yesterday and flew to New York. One of them, named Malik, is known as "Molotov's personal representative." Their mission is very mysterious. They stayed in the VIP lounge at the airport while transiting through London and refused to meet anyone.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 13th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko will soon be relieved of his post as the Soviet Union's chief representative to the United Nations. Gromyko's position will be taken over by another Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Malik. Gromyko himself confirmed that he will leave his post as Soviet representative to the United Nations within a few weeks and return to the Soviet Union to take a long-delayed vacation. Asked whether he would return to his post when the United Nations holds its General Assembly in Paris this autumn, Gromyko shrugged and smiled, saying, "I know nothing." Even if this development is temporary in nature, it is enough to indicate a major change in the Kremlin's diplomatic personnel.</p>
<h3 id="e41">U.S. Authorities Clearly Warn the Soviet Union That its Expansionist Policy Should Have Limits; The Soviet Union's Publication of Confidential Exchanges Has Three Effects <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Senior U.S. government officials said that the aim of U.S. foreign policy remains to inform the Soviet Union that its expansionist policy should have certain limits, and that exceeding these limits would inevitably risk causing tragic consequences. Since Moscow unilaterally published the contents of the confidential U.S.-Soviet exchanges of views on the current situation, the State Department has been engaged in reorganizing U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations in order to carry out a thorough overhaul.</p>
<p>U.S. officials did not specifically explain the "limits of Soviet expansion" that the U.S. government recognizes, nor did they characterize their geographical location, but pointed out that certain areas, including Greece, Iran, and Norway, are areas that the U.S. government considers to be of major strategic importance. The U.S. government will do its utmost to prevent these areas from falling under communist control. U.S. diplomats also believe that if Germany and Japan had known before World War II that certain of their actions would lead to war, they might have stopped such actions before it was too late.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The motivation behind Moscow's publication of the contents of the exchanges between Molotov and Ambassador Smith remains a mystery. Observers speculate that the Soviet move has three effects: (1) to alienate the United States from Western Europe in order to hinder the progress of the Marshall Plan and U.S. support for the Western European alliance; (2) to confuse American public opinion at a time when the U.S. Congress is debating military appropriations and military aid to the Western European alliance; (3) to provide propaganda material for global communists, pointing out that the United States rejected the Soviet Union's peace proposals and making people believe that the current tension is caused by the United States. The timing of Moscow Radio's publication of the full text of Molotov's statement and part of Smith's statement is particularly noteworthy. Moscow Radio broadcast the statement in the evening, so the official reactions from Washington or Europe would not be available until the next morning at the earliest, and the broadcast also came shortly after Ambassador Smith left Moscow for a vacation in France, clearly with the intention of denying the United States or the U.S. ambassador an immediate opportunity to explain. Therefore, before the United States had a chance to make a statement, the whole world knew that the Soviet Union had launched a peace offensive in the Cold War. In this regard, the Soviet scheme has obviously succeeded, and before Marshall made a statement, world public opinion, though not expressing relief upon hearing Moscow's broadcast.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Provisional Extension of Three Days for Payment of Business Income Tax <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Although the business community in Shanghai is mostly opposed to the method of provisional payment of six times the business income tax for the 37th year, the financial authorities are maintaining the original proposal. Based on last year's standards, the tax will be temporarily collected at six times the amount. Afterwards, the profit and loss of each industry will be determined based on the results of the declaration and auditing. Those with more surplus than last year must pay additional income tax beyond the six times. Those whose business conditions are worse than last year may have a portion of the tax refunded by the national treasury with interest. The reporting work is being actively carried out, and the tax bureau will soon conduct a sample audit of the accounts of each industry to determine a common standard for tax payment. As for the installment payment of taxes, the Executive Yuan has accepted the request of the Shanghai business community. Those with a tax amount of more than 200 million yuan may pay in two equal installments on the 15th of this month and the 16th of June. Those with a tax amount of less than 200 million yuan must pay in full around the middle of this month. Merchants in Shanghai have argued that the deadline of May 15 is too tight and have requested an extension. According to senior tax bureau officials last night, the Ministry of Finance has approved an extension of three days for the first tax payment period, meaning that the first batch of taxes must be paid by the 18th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Anatomy Society Seeks Corpses, Requests Ministry of Education to Expedite Regulations so that Schools Can Apply for Them <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>According to Dr. Wang Youqi, Professor of Anatomy at Shanghai Medical College, they have now requested the Ministry of Education and relevant parties through the Anatomy Society to expedite the formulation of regulations for the provision of corpses for physiological anatomy required by medical schools, including legal procedures and all technical conveniences. After the war, the feudal superstitious gang forces in Shanghai society rose, and the first to be affected were the medical colleges. They could no longer obtain the corpses found on the streets from charitable halls or police and health agencies. A year ago, the anatomical practice at Shanghai Medical College was supplied with the corpses of Japanese prisoners of war who died of illness by the Army Hospital. Now, another business of the medical college is to keep corpses for others. They disinfect and preserve all the corpses they can get. If no one claims them after two months, they can be supplied to students for dissection. To this day, dead people are still precious items, with one corpse allocated to every six students. The Anatomy Society now plans to launch an academic publicity campaign to dispel the general social prejudice and superstition against corpses.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Jifu, a Hong Kong businessman, lives at 389 Jianguo West Road in this city. He has a factory in Hong Kong, so he is often not in Shanghai. On the afternoon of January 12th of this year, five men suddenly came to the house, claiming to be sent by the police station because someone reported that Wang was taking drugs, and they came to search. Wang's wife, Ma Saiju, came forward to receive them. One man wearing a suit and overcoat went up to the third floor and found a bag of opium residue. They also found a 10.4-carat diamond ring and a 4.5-carat diamond ring, as well as a gold watch, and took them away. They claimed that they would take the diamond rings and gold watch back to the bureau and return them after the official business was completed. A few days later, Ma received a threatening phone call, prohibiting her from reporting to the police station. When Wang returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, he reported to the police station. Later, the case was solved. The process of cracking the case is as follows: Wang's driver picked up his young master from school on January 12th. When he arrived at the gate, he saw an old policeman in uniform guarding the gate, and the others were searching inside the house. More than ten days later, the driver passed by the Jindu Theater on Zhongzheng Middle Road and saw an old policeman directing traffic. He looked familiar. Upon closer inspection, it was the person guarding the gate, and he secretly noted his number, which was 2397. The policeman saw that someone was paying attention and took off his armband and hat and left. Later, he reported to the police station for investigation and learned that he was Cheng Shouzhen, a policeman from the New City Branch, who had already asked for leave. Another plainclothes policeman, Lou Zhiqing, also deserted his post and fled. After investigation, it was found that there were accomplices, Zhang Weili, Qian Mingzhi, and Tang Yunpeng. Except for Lou Zhiqing, who was captured, the others were at large. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, a public prosecution was filed for the crime of corruption, and it was transferred to the criminal court of the district court yesterday for handling.</p>

So he returned to the court. Judge Liao then ruled, "The execution order you submitted has expired and cannot be executed." Mao said, "The notice of execution was torn off by Xiang Runzhi." Judge Liao said, "This notice was blown down by the wind and has been returned to the court." Wang then said to Mao from the side, "You must take criminal responsibility for what you said."

After mediation, Mao agreed to express his apology verbally, but Wang insisted that he apologize in person, otherwise he would sue. It is still unknown how this matter will develop.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the tenth day of the National Games. The men's and women's swimming competitions have been held for three days. The weather is beautiful, and new records are emerging one after another. There are three new national records broken: (1) In the men's 100-meter freestyle final, Wu Chuanyu from Indonesia achieved a time of 1 minute and 3.3 seconds. (2) The Hong Kong team achieved a time of 2 minutes and 35.6 seconds in the women's 200-meter freestyle relay final, both of which are new national records. (3) The results of the two groups in the men's 200-meter freestyle relay preliminary round also broke the national record. The men's 100-meter backstroke preliminary round and semi-final both broke the conference record. Today is the last day of the swimming competition, and all events will be completed. Judging from the results of the past three days, it is hoped that nine out of ten old swimming records will be broken, which is the most fruitful harvest of this National Games. The Hong Kong team still leads in the scores of both the men's and women's groups, and there is no doubt that they will win both championships.</p>
<p>The finals of the ball games have reached the final stage. The champions of soccer, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's singles tennis, men's and women's volleyball, and men's softball will be produced today. The unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere of the final round of the championship finals today is predictable. The champion of the men's volleyball consolation round has already been produced, won by the Jilin team.</p>
<p>In the international track and field competition, the Chinese representative team organized by the outstanding athletes of the National Games will hold a friendly competition with the Western United team organized by Western expatriate groups in this city at the track and field ground starting at 10:00 a.m. today. The elites of China and the West will gather in one place, and brilliant records are bound to appear.</p>

<p>Men's 200m Relay, Two Groups Dominate, Malaysian Chinese Team Achieves 1 Minute 57.6 Seconds</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday's swimming events were held in the morning and afternoon. Among the three morning events, the men's 200-meter freestyle relay preliminary round was particularly outstanding. The competition process is described as follows:</p>
<p>Women's 100-meter Backstroke Preliminary Round: Divided into two groups, the top four from each group advanced. Huang Bixia from Malaysia won the first group, while Zheng Yanying, a 14-year-old young athlete from Guangzhou, won the second group. Zheng swam with good momentum, but her stamina was insufficient due to her young age, slightly affecting her performance. However, she was praised by the audience and received a warm applause.</p>
<p>Men's 200-meter Freestyle Relay Preliminary Round: Both groups broke the national record of 2 minutes 1.1 seconds, a major achievement of yesterday's event. The Malaysian Chinese team won the first group with a time of 1 minute 57.6 seconds, and the Guangzhou team won the second group with a time of 1 minute 59.9 seconds.</p>
<p>In the first group, the competition between the Malaysian Chinese team and Hong Kong was extremely fierce and exciting. The first two swimmers were almost evenly matched. In the end, Feng Zhaoyu of the Malaysian Chinese team had excellent speed, surpassing the Hong Kong team by a distance of seven meters. The members of the Malaysian Chinese team were Zhang Shoushan, Tan Qingren, Chen Nengde, and Feng Zhaoyu. The Hong Kong team consisted of Cai Liheng, Zhang Xianlin, Liu Dibing, and You Shikun.</p>
<p>In the second group, the swimmers entered the water after three false starts. Guangzhou took the lead after the second swimmer and maintained the advantage until the finish line, defeating the Navy team by a margin of three meters. The Guangzhou athletes were Chen Chaochang, Cai Guoqing, Luo Yurong, and Wu Nian. The Navy team consisted of Xu Heng, Wu Enhui, Liu Xinghua, and Liu Xinmin. The Indonesian Chinese Overseas Chinese team could not participate due to an insufficient number of representatives, which was regrettable to many. Indonesia had performed excellently in the short-distance events this time, and there was no doubt that they would have created a new record otherwise.</p>
<p>Men's 1500-meter Heat: The first group was held in the morning, with five participants. Chen Chuan from Guangxi withdrew halfway, and only four athletes reached the finish line. Liu Dibing from Hong Kong won first place with a time of 25 minutes 7.5 seconds, followed by Guan Huawen from Malaysia in second place, and another Hong Kong athlete, You Shikun, in third place.</p>
<p>In the afternoon swimming events, six events were held according to the scheduled order, among which the finals of the men's 100-meter freestyle and the women's 200-meter freestyle relay were particularly outstanding, both breaking the national records. Two water polo demonstration matches were not held due to the withdrawal of the Philippine Chinese and Guangzhou teams. The competition process of each event is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Men's 100-meter Backstroke Semifinals: Divided into two groups, the top four from each group advanced. In the first group, the famous Shanghai player and the young Indonesian Chinese player Zhong Tiansheng faced off, inevitably leading to a fierce competition. However, after the turn, Lao Wang led all the way and completed the entire course in 1 minute 22 seconds. In the second group, Feng Zhaoyu from Malaysia dominated from start to finish, finishing nearly ten meters ahead of the second-place Philippine Chinese player Li Fanleng, with a time of 1 minute 17.7 seconds. The results of both groups broke the event record.</p>
<p>Diving Performance Preliminary Round: As the bell rang three times, the diving performance competition began. There were 14 registered participants, but only 10 actually participated. One person withdrew halfway, so a total of 9 people completed the entire competition. In yesterday's preliminary round, each participant performed eight dives from the low springboard, with four basic dives and four freestyle dives. The basic dives included: (1) Front entry (front swallow dive), (2) Running forward somersault entry (front scythe dive), (3) Standing back entry (back swallow dive), (4) Standing backward somersault entry (back scythe dive). Each participant chose four of their best freestyle dives and performed them with their best effort. The scores were determined by the subjective scores given by the three judges on-site, and the ranking of each person was determined by the total score. Among the nine divers who participated yesterday, Tan Qingren from Malaysia was the tallest and thinnest. However, when this diver dived, he was as light as a swallow. He ran on the springboard, and the pace was just right. He stepped on the end of the springboard with a light and appropriate force, and his body stretched and flew up, entering the water at a 45-degree angle without deviation, looking like a dragonfly skimming the water from a distance. The audience applauded thunderously. This was the highest-scoring dive in the basic dives yesterday. The thin Tan scored a lot of points in several basic dives, laying the foundation for his championship in the preliminary round. Chang Dexing from the Navy was short and sturdy, with a beautiful outline, in contrast to the thin Tan. This diver practiced the front and back swallow dives so naturally, like eating a simple meal. Who knew that when he went to the competition yesterday, his best style went wrong. Fortunately, he made up for the lost points in the three freestyle dives, including the front and back scythe and the front and back somersault. He needs to work harder today to compete with the thin Tan. Gu Jiaju from Guangzhou had a moderate build. His second dive, a front and back one-and-a-half somersault, was the highest-scoring dive in the freestyle dives yesterday. The Shanghai veteran Wang Anxiang has gained weight, and his body is not as agile as before. Deng Molin, a major general in the Army, reportedly won third place in diving at the 6th National Games. He relived his old dream after his military life. It seems that he lacks practice, and he chose several strenuous and unrewarding postures. He was at the bottom of the preliminary round. He should work harder today to show his heroic qualities.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Shanghai Team Penalized and Suspended, Championship Situation Changes, Only One Football Decisive Battle Today, Police and Army Clash, Related to Championship Gain or Loss, Police Team Will Go All Out <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the football round-robin tournament of the National Games, since the Army team filed a protest and the Police team issued a statement a few days ago, the championship contention has encountered hidden reefs. The Judging Committee yesterday specially discussed this matter in detail. As a result, it was decided that the Shanghai team voluntarily abandoned the competition. According to the competition rules, they should be suspended from the competition, and all the results obtained by the Shanghai team in the round-robin finals will not be counted. After the announcement of this decision, the situation of the round-robin tournament has completely changed as follows:</p>
<p>Unit Played Wins Losses Draws Goals Scored Points</p>
<p>Police 2 0 0 1 1 1 point</p>
<p>Hong Kong 2 1 0 1 3 3 points</p>
<p>Army 2 0 1 0 0 0 points</p>
<p>The most affected by this are the Police and Army teams, each losing two points. Today's match between Hong Kong and Shanghai, due to Shanghai's disqualification, the Hong Kong team has a bye. The team will rely solely on the three points obtained in the previous two matches to compete with the Police for the championship. The Police and Army teams were originally scheduled to meet at the athletic field at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow. However, the Police team stated that the conference will close on the 16th, and they have already purchased plane tickets, and all team members are scheduled to fly back to Guangzhou on the morning of the 16th, making it difficult to participate in the competition within the above-mentioned time. Therefore, the conference has decided to reschedule the match to 4:00 p.m. today. If the Police team can defeat the Army team today, their score will be equal to that of the Hong Kong team. Whether they can win the championship will depend on whether their goals scored can exceed 2-0, otherwise it will be the same as the Hong Kong team, and there will inevitably be further disputes. As for the protest previously filed by the Army, it was officially returned by the conference yesterday. Today's victory or defeat of the team will directly determine who belongs to the champion and runner-up teams. Its importance is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Football Elimination Match, Dispute Arises in the Beijing-Hubei Match <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Team Members Insult Referee, Disqualified from the Competition</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, there were only two elimination matches in the football competition. The Navy defeated the Philippine Chinese team 2-0, and Nanjing defeated Hubei 1-0. In the Beijing-Hubei match, the Beijing team scored a goal in the first half. In the last two minutes of the second half, two Hubei team members, Yan Zhenzhang and Zhu Yunong, were dissatisfied with the referee Zhu Quan's decision on offside, causing a dispute. The match could not be finished, and the Hubei team was ruled to have forfeited the match, ending abruptly with a score of 1-0. Afterwards, Zhu Quan submitted a report to the conference, stating that the Hubei team had insulted the referee. After deliberation, the Judging Committee decided to disqualify the Hubei team from this year's football competition and ban Yan and Zhu from participating in the next conference's football competition. Looking at the elimination matches, there are now only three teams left competing: Hai Ping, Sichuan, and Nanjing. The Navy will encounter them at Yi Yuan at 4:00 p.m. today. The Navy has a higher chance of winning. If the Navy can defeat Sichuan, they will face Nanjing again at the athletic field at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. After this match concludes, the champion of the elimination matches can be smoothly produced.</p>

<p>The diving performance took a full hour and ten minutes. Immediately following was another fatigue bombardment, the second group of the 1500-meter freestyle heats entered the stage.</p>
<p>Looking at the list, fortunately, there were two southern speedboats, Chen Zhennan and Huang Jinhua, participating, supplemented by Luo Jinlong, the son of a Tianjin high-ranking official, and Huang Yunsen, Shanghai's slow train, for a total of four people. After swimming half the distance, Chen Zhennan left Huang and Luo behind by as much as 75 meters. Chen's absolute advantage and Huang Yunsen's backwardness had already determined the champion and last place. The problem was the two, Little Huang and Old Luo, who did not give way to each other, followed each other closely, and when the two changed breaths, one to the left and one to the right, they happened to face each other, watching each other's progress clearly, so that the entire pool of 30 laps almost fought to the end. In the last 50 meters, Little Huang was ultimately young and strong, and he unexpectedly still had a burst of energy left to prepare for the final sprint. Old Luo was finally defeated, falling behind by 5 meters. Turning around, the slow train Huang Yunsen was still leisurely paddling. No one could count how many laps he had fallen behind. However, he was not discouraged by his defeat. The starter actually aimed at the top of his head and fired a shot during his last lap. The slow train looked like it had just started a fire and accelerated to complete the entire course. When he got up, the Shanghai audience gave him warm applause. He represents Shanghai, and Shanghai lacks swimming champions. At least this sporting spirit is worth praising.</p>
<p>Men's 100-meter Final: This was the most watched event of yesterday's competition. It was held close to 5:00 p.m., and the temperature had dropped to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Fortunately, the water temperature remained around 76 degrees after being exposed to the sun. A total of seven people participated in the competition. Huang Changbei from Indonesian Chinese gave up due to illness. Wu Chuanyu from Indonesian Chinese, who had the best results in the preliminary and semi-finals, was the strongest. Liu Dibing from Hong Kong participated in the 1500-meter freestyle semi-final in the morning. Although he won the first place in the first group, his strength was inevitably dispersed, but he still had the determination to fight. In this competition, Wu Chuanyu and Yu Shundao from Indonesian Chinese occupied the two outer lanes, and Di Bing was in the middle. As soon as the gun sounded, Chuanyu and Shundao entered the water the fastest. The rest were almost indistinguishable, fighting for this moment of time. All that could be seen was that on the seven lanes, seven Hun Jianglongs were turning up white waves, and water splashed everywhere. After turning around at 50 meters, Chuanyu took the lead step by step, and Dibing followed closely. Feng Zhaoyu from Malaysia refused to fall behind and caught up head-on. The rest of the participants kept waving their hands and fighting to the end. As a result, Chuanyu still defeated Dibing by a margin of two meters and reached the finish line first, with a time of 1 minute 3.3 seconds, which was equal to his best record in the semi-finals, shortening the national record by 2.4 seconds. Some people said that Dibing and Chuanyu were not far apart, and the result should also break the national record. However, only one timer recorded the time, and the time recorded could not be officially recognized.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Women's 200-Meter Relay Swim: Hong Kong Mermaids Achieve Excellent Results, Breaking National Record with 2 Minutes 35.6 Seconds <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Only the Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Shanghai teams participated in the women's 200-meter relay race, which was temporarily changed to the final. The Hong Kong mermaids Huang Wanzhen, Huang Wansheng, Zeng Fengqun, and Gao Miaoling were all dispatched, and the championship was "certain." Everyone wanted to see to what extent the national record would be broken. The first swimmer, Huang Wanzhen, entered the water first as the gun fired, and was already six meters ahead after swimming 50 meters. The second swimmer, Wansheng, continued to work hard, and was more than ten meters ahead after 100 meters. The third swimmer, Zeng Fengqun, and the fourth swimmer, Gao, each used their best skills to sprint to the end, with a time of 2 minutes 35.6 seconds, breaking the national record, shortening the time by 3.2 seconds. They left the Taiwan girls behind by as much as 40 meters. All of the Hong Kong mermaids used freestyle from beginning to end, neat and beautiful. The Taiwan girls were all dark-skinned. They looked strong and sturdy, and could not help but pale in comparison to the Hong Kong mermaids. But compared to the Shanghai ladies, their strength was still a cut above, and they finally snatched the runner-up. Yesterday, the Shanghai team swam with a spectacular style. The first swimmer, You Huixia, swam freestyle, and the second swimmer, Zhang Xingyan, swam backstroke. When she was about to reach the pool wall, she was afraid of hitting her head, so she stopped two meters away from the pool and paddled to the edge of the pool. The third swimmer, Huang Zongying, also swam backstroke, and the fourth swimmer, Liu Tian, swam breaststroke. The entire course was all-encompassing, and the style was extremely free and easy. They finally made it to the end. Anyway, the third place was uncontested. Compared to the first place, they were lagging behind by 80 or 90 meters.</p>
<p>Men's 400-Meter Heat: Divided into two groups, the top four from each group advanced. It was already close to dusk, and each group had only five participants competing. After entering the water in the first group, Philippine Zhuang Meidao took the lead first, leading all the way. At 100 meters, he briefly competed with Hong Kong's You Shikun, but at 200 meters, Zhuang had already taken the advantage and finally led to the end, leaving the second-place Hong Kong's Huang Jinhua behind by ten meters, with a time of 6 minutes 4.6 seconds. The second group was again the world of Hong Kong's Chen Zhennan, with no one competing with him, completing the entire course in 5 minutes 50.7 seconds. Liu Dibing fought continuously, exhausted, and finished fourth, almost being eliminated.</p>

<p>Philippine Chinese</p>
<p>Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Yu Jin, Cai Jindian, Wu Kangkai</p>

<h3 id="e103">All Football Referees Resign Again <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai football referees decided last night to submit their resignations to the National Games Referees Group. They have decided not to referee the last two days, today and tomorrow. According to the referees, disputes have repeatedly occurred on the football field, and there is no guarantee for the safety of the referees. They submitted their resignations to Hao Gengsheng, the secretary-general of the conference, the night before last. After Secretary-General Hao's earnest retention, Commander Xuan of the security police also expressed his willingness to be responsible for ensuring safety. Only then did they dispel their intention to resign and reluctantly do their best.</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, in the football elimination match between Hubei and Nanjing, the referee was Zhu Quan. Nanjing took the lead with a score of 1-0, and there was still one and a half minutes left, and the situation was quite tense. When the Hubei team attacked, the referee Zhu Quan ruled it offside, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the Hubei team. The captain immediately stepped forward to question Zhu Quan. According to Zhu Quan, at that time, a Hubei team player, number 12, punched him three times, and the momentum was very fierce. Zhu suppressed his anger and blew the whistle to end the match, and then reported the process to the referees group. The Shanghai referees believe that in this environment where there is no sportsmanship, lack of athlete spirit, and referees have no safety guarantee, they have no choice but to stop performing their duties and submit their resignations to the conference.</p>

<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Hong Xucai</p>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] Among the "new mermaids" produced this year, in addition to the Huang sisters from Hong Kong, there are also the Zheng sisters from Guangzhou, who have just begun to show their talent in this National Games but have already made a stunning debut.</p>
<p>Zheng Yanying is fourteen years old, and Zheng Xueying is thirteen years old, but the younger sister is taller and more robust than the older sister. They have only been swimming for a year, but they have achieved such amazing results, which makes people have to believe that this is a gift.</p>
<p>Playing by the Small River at the Door</p>
<p>Last year, the Zheng sisters were students in the second year of junior high school at Tianjin Cihui Middle School. They speak good Mandarin. The reporter asked them, "Who taught you to swim?" They shook their heads and replied, "No one taught us. There is a small river at the entrance of our village. We saw people swimming well, so we followed them and paddled around, and gradually we learned how to do it."</p>
<p>Five days last year, their father took them to join the Guangzhou swimming team. The instructor, Su Damo, believed that they were indeed talented and carefully trained them. Coincidentally, last year the Zheng sisters missed the start of the school year because their family moved to the countryside in Nanhai, Guangdong, so they temporarily stopped attending school. This created an opportunity for them to practice swimming fully.</p>
<p>Every morning at 8:00 AM, their father personally accompanied his two daughters, taking a sampan to the Guangzhou swimming team for practice, returning home at 5:00 PM. Although the round trip took four hours, they never stopped. Over the past year, their performance has improved rapidly, and their speed is astonishing.</p>
<p>Audience Goes Crazy at First Sight</p>
<p>Yanying specializes in backstroke, and Xueying swims breaststroke, each with their own strengths. On the first day of the swimming competition, Xueying participated in the preliminary round of the 200-meter breaststroke and won second place. Yesterday, Yanying participated in the preliminary round of the 100-meter backstroke and won first place. Among the swimmers, they were the youngest and shortest, but when they jumped into the water, their movements were agile and their postures were beautiful. For a time, the audience's applause and cheers were almost frantic. The fourteen-year-old Yanying was surrounded by adults taking photos and asking for autographs as soon as she got out of the water. Her trembling little hand wrote very well!</p>
<p>Such amazing achievements for young girls of thirteen or fourteen are truly rare talents. It is believed that if they are given time, they will surely shine in the sports world!</p>
<p>Winning the Championship is a Double Blessing</p>
<p>Since winning the championship, the new mermaids Huang Wanzhen and Huang Wansheng have been extremely proud and always smiling. Wanzhen is especially excited and happy. It turns out that Wanzhen has therefore obtained the opportunity to study in the United States. Yesterday, the Huang sisters' mother told reporters: Wanzhen loves music and is determined to study in the United States. As for her father, he insisted on sending his daughter to England, so the father and daughter could not agree. Because Wanzhen kept pestering him, the father made a wish: "If you participate in the National Games this time and can break the national record, then I will agree to you going to the United States." Now that Wanzhen has succeeded and returned with a triumphant song, the realization of her ideal is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad are Both Good</p>
<p>After receiving the good news of Wanzhen's success, her father sent a congratulatory telegram. He had already planned her itinerary. This autumn, he plans to take Wanzhen to England first to let her see the London World Games, and then send her to the United States to study.</p>
<p>Wanzhen's mother said: Although her daughter broke the national record, this result is not ideal. She will continue to have the Huang sisters practice hard and will never allow any arrogance or complacency. Let us look forward to the more brilliant light of this lucky pair!</p>

<h3 id="e108">Men's Tennis Doubles Long and Arduous Battle: Police Team Wins Over Indonesia, Hong Kong Team Defeats Malaysia. The Indecisive and Fiercely Contested Match with Thrilling Scenes Left the Audience Restless. <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The finals of the men's and women's tennis championships, Xu Weipei (Hong Kong) forfeited to Ye Guanxiong (Guangzhou) in the men's singles yesterday morning, and Wang Wenzheng (Police) forfeited to Tao Guanqiu (Police). Therefore, the focus of the tennis court shifted to the men's doubles round-robin final in the afternoon. Exhausting finals, endless rounds, a player has to hold a singles final in the morning and a doubles final in the afternoon, with limited energy, it is difficult to cope, so Xu Weipei Wang Wenzheng's abandonment of singles, to fully cope with doubles, is a smart way.</p>
<p>In the men's doubles final, Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng fought a five-set battle, defeating Indonesian players Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan. The fierce battle lasted for three hours, with wonderful performances and thrilling moments. The division of victory and defeat was often at stake. Hundreds of spectators were restless. Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan could have won but did not. Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng came from behind. This game was undoubtedly a major and exciting program yesterday. In another game, the Xu brothers Weipei and Runpei of Hong Kong defeated Malaysian players Xie Roberlin and Shan Zhen in four sets, winning three to one relatively easily. The doubles champion will be decided in a battle between Tao Wang and the two Xus. The results of yesterday's men's singles and doubles round-robin finals are listed below:</p>
<p>Men's Singles Round-Robin</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong (Guangzhou) wins against Xu Weipei (Hong Kong) Xu forfeits</p>
<p>Tao Guanqiu (Police) wins against Wang Wenzheng (Police) Wang forfeits</p>
<p>Men's Doubles Round-Robin</p>
<p>Li Wenxuan and Chen Lichao Fall Short</p>
<p>The Tao Wang and Chen Li teams can be said to be evenly matched. Chen Lichao and Tao Guanqiu are of course the best, and their performances are also good. Smashing, blocking, and wonderful shots appear frequently. If Li Wenxuan's young experience was not enough, and he lost his temper, and accumulated touches on the net, Chen Lichao's team would have won long ago. Tao Guanqiu is also like this, Wang Wenzheng is exhausted, cannot run, and repeatedly touches the net to lose points, otherwise Tao Guanqiu's team would have won long ago. Tao Wang relied entirely on experience and seniority, and in the midst of difficult situations, sometimes outstanding shots emerged, opening up new paths. Chen Lichao powerfully counters, attacking Tao Guanqiu's backhand, Tao actually yielded to it, but unfortunately Li Wenxuan's combination was too weak and fell short, which was a pity for hundreds of spectators.</p>
<p>The first set was immediately stalemated, the Indonesian team scored three consecutive games, the police team also returned four games, the Indonesian team won two games, and took the lead again with five to four. Tao Wang tied at five, then scored two games, and it was already difficult to determine the victory or defeat in the first set with seven to five. After a set of battle, Wang Wenzheng was already showing signs of weakness, so in the second and third sets, Indonesians Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan exerted pressure and easily won two sets with six to three and six to four, coming from behind with two to one. The general audience thought that the trend of victory and defeat had been divided, and there would be no problem. Unexpectedly, after a break and a restart, Chen Li took the lead with three to two in the fourth set. Because of Li Wenxuan's mistakes, he lost three consecutive games and pulled back a game, becoming four to five. In the tenth game, Chen Li presented a valuable "game point". Four to six, tying at two sets each. In the fifth set, Chen Li's momentum rose and took the lead with five to three. In the decisive game, after repeated "equal", the Chen Li team lightly lost one point of "set point" and "winning point" that determined the victory or defeat. In the audience, it was a sigh for those who could win but did not. Five to five, six to six, seven to five, and the police team Tao Wang finally won the final victory.</p>
<p>Xie and Lin Are Brave and Messy, the Two Xus Qin Kai</p>
<p>In the battle between the two Xus and Malaysia's Xie and Lin, Xie and Lin were brave and messy, blocking and smashing, and the ball was not grasped, and weakness could not win. Insufficient defense, let alone aggressive. After losing two sets with six to four, six to four, the Xu brothers were careless, and the two Malaysian players won back a set with eight to six. In the fourth set, the Xu brothers won again with six to two.</p>
<p>Women's Singles Round-Robin</p>
<p>Women's Doubles Round-Robin</p>
<p>Two Women's Singles Games: One Relaxed, One Intense</p>
<p>Yang Weibin won against Lu Yuanchun in the women's singles, extremely easily. In the first set, she won four consecutive games, and after losing two games, she won two more games. In the second set, Yang won six consecutive games to win a shutout. Yang Weibin is sure to win the women's singles championship.</p>
<p>Chen Jinshi took the stage and defeated Zhu Zhiying 6-1 in the first set with powerful long shots. In the second set, Zhu targeted Chen Jinshi's weakness of being bad at running, and attacked with long shots and short cuts, sometimes far and sometimes near. As expected, she pulled back a set 6-4. Zhu Zhiying won the first game in the third set, but unfortunately she could not calm down and was eventually defeated. However, Zhu Zhiying's performance yesterday was indeed quite wonderful and had exhausted all her energy.</p>
<p>The strength of the two women's doubles finals is very different, and the situation has become a competition for the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Shanghai Should Win Against Philippines in Today's Women's Basketball Championship <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Qian Changnian</p>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] Today's women's basketball championship, Shanghai vs. the Philippines, will be held at 2:00 PM in the gymnasium. If the Shanghai team can win, it will be crowned as the basketball queen. Although the Philippines team has lost to Fujian once, if it can beat Shanghai today, it will still have a glimmer of hope for the championship.</p>
<p>I think that no matter in terms of psychological conditions, state, or even the use of tactics, the Shanghai team has more favorable conditions.</p>
<p>In terms of psychological conditions, the Philippines team can only win and cannot lose, and they lack experience - the battle against Fujian was a defeat for this reason. Shanghai's Huang Mingyuan and others are veterans who have been in the basketball world for many years and are better able to use their brains calmly. What's more, Shanghai has a fierce front line to give a warning, which can put the Philippines in a state of panic and weaken their combat power.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of state, the current Shanghai team deserves the title of being sharp in attack and solid in defense. Forwards Shi Zonglan and Huang Mingyuan both have the superb skills of dribbling deep into the enemy's basket and scoring with one hand. The shooting rate of the three forwards is also stable at an extremely high level. The guards have a tacit understanding of alternating marking, with few loopholes, and they have sufficient stamina. Zhu Jinyun is particularly outstanding. It can be assumed that she can take on the role of locking down Yang Xiuzhi, the key to the Philippines team's scoring. This can reduce the Philippines team's score.</p>
<p>The Philippines team's defense is not impenetrable, and the three forwards of the Shanghai team all have the possibility of scoring average points. Shi Zonglan's free throws are too unfamiliar, but fortunately, the relationship is subtle and will not affect the overall situation.</p>
<p>In terms of the use of tactics, the Shanghai team may wish to divide the forwards and guards into two combat organizations. The guards are responsible for restricting the activities of the Philippines team's forwards, especially Yang Xiuzhi, and must fully mark them. The forwards are responsible for scoring points. If the Philippines wants to win, unless the Shanghai team's guards cannot stop the activity of the Philippines team's forwards, resulting in a situation where the gains do not outweigh the losses, and they lose by a small margin. In fact, this possibility is extremely small. We place our expectations and trust in the Shanghai team's defense.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Women's Volleyball Two Championship Matches: Taiwan Defeats Hunan, Shanghai Crushes Guangzhou; Yang Yu'er's Serve Wins Cheers from the Entire Audience; Shanghai Defeats Guangzhou with Utter Ease <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The women's volleyball round-robin matches between Taiwan and Hunan, and Shanghai and Guangzhou, continued yesterday afternoon at the City Sports Field. As a result, Taiwan defeated Hunan with a score of 2-1, while Shanghai overwhelmed Guangzhou in straight sets.</p>
<p>In the first game, both sides had their strategic gains and losses, but Hunan was slightly better than Taiwan. This key was Zheng Peikun (left front row), the soul of the Hunan team. Her quick attacks and fast spikes caused Taiwan to lose the first set.</p>
<p>At the start of the second set, the very first ball ignited a fierce battle. After a prolonged struggle, Hunan, not good at long battles, lost the first point. After that, the left wing of Hunan's front row repeatedly lost ground, and Taiwan's right second row launched a large-scale offensive, continuously spiking, and finally Taiwan won back a set with a score of 21-10.</p>
<p>In the third set, both sides repeatedly tied, their skills making it difficult to distinguish their levels. For example, Taiwan had Yang Yu'er's spikes, while Hunan responded with Zheng Peikun's fast attacks. Although the Hunan team's serves were good, Chen Huaguang, the left-handed pitcher from Taiwan, was also not bad. After an eight-point tie, the Hunan team gained points through serves, gradually taking the lead.</p>
<p>Taiwan became chaotic due to rotation. When the score was 8 (Taiwan) to 11 (Hunan), the two generals of the left and right wings of the third row actually overlapped, losing the ball due to scrambling. Fortunately, when Yang Yu'er rotated to serve at 11-14, she displayed great power, scoring six points in a row, shocking the Hunan team and cheering the audience. In the end, Taiwan won the third set and returned in triumph. The battle conditions of the two games are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Taiwan: Luo, Ni, Yang Yu'er, Gao Jingya, Chen Jinxi, Jiang Guizhi, Zhang Yuese, Yan Xiuying, Chen Meiyu, Chen Huaguang</p>
<p>Hunan: Zheng Peiji, Qin Benze, Chen Chunxiu, Liu Xingheng, Zeng Yuyuan, Liao Zhiqiang, Zheng Peikun, Liu Yunshan, Liu Zhulan</p>
<p>The match between Shanghai and Guangzhou was, in fact, the battle for the third and fourth places in the championship. The strength disparity was too great, and the battle was lackluster. At the beginning of the first set, the Shanghai team served, winning 15 points in a row, breaking the record of any volleyball game in this competition. As a result, the Shanghai team won the first set 21-4. By the second set, the Shanghai team won so effortlessly that they inevitably underestimated the enemy, so they were once tied by the other side, but in the end they still won another set with a score of 21-9, securing victory.</p>
<p>Men's Volleyball Losers' Match: Jilin Defeats Zhejiang</p>
<p>[Our Report] The men's volleyball losers' final between Jilin and Zhejiang took place yesterday morning. After the start of the match, the two armies repeatedly tied, making it difficult to distinguish who was better, but Jilin's serving skills were quite strong, so they defeated Zhejiang with a score of 3-1. The score of each game was 20 (Jilin) to 22 (Zhejiang), 22-20, 21-12.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The second week of the men's softball losers' match took place yesterday morning in Yiyuan. The Navy team only played five innings and easily defeated Henan with a score of 11-5. In another match, the Fujian team, which unfortunately lost to the Police team by one point in the first battle, demonstrated great power, fiercely attacking the United Logistics team, with a score of 21-0, creating the record for the most points scored in a softball match in this competition. They will compete with the Navy team tomorrow (16th) for the losers' championship. The Fujian team has many good players from St. John's University in the city, and should be able to win.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The men's baseball exhibition match final, Taiwan vs. Shanghai, was held at the Racecourse at 1:30 PM yesterday, with the famous referee Zhang Guoxun officiating. Both sides built deep trenches and high fortresses, taking every step with caution, and President Zhang Chaogui's excellent performance as the second pitcher was also exceptional. Neither side gained anything for as many as eight innings. Taiwan relied on a bunt in the fourth inning to get on base and score three points. Although Shanghai tried their best to counterattack, they only managed to score one point in the sixth inning by Liang Youwen. After that, neither side made any further achievements, and the combined team defeated their strong enemy by 3-1, winning the baseball exhibition match championship title.</p>

<p>Gansu's Daughters Have the Same Spirit</p>
<p>[Our Report] Two women's softball matches were held yesterday morning at the General Assembly Athletics Field. In the first battle, Shanghai vs. Gansu, the Shanghai team was stronger, taking the lead at every turn. By the fourth inning, when they were leading by ten points, they thought they had victory in their grasp, and hastily replaced six starting players, so that other players would have the opportunity to play. The original intention should not be criticized. Unexpectedly, Gansu suddenly rose up and strengthened their efforts, taking advantage of the Shanghai team's slight arrogance and unstable formation, launching an attack, creating a bases-loaded situation twice. In the last three innings, the Shanghai team made frequent mistakes, and were forced to a 17-17 tie. Finally, thanks to Cheng Mulan hitting a point, they were able to avoid tying with Gansu. The generals of Gansu, although they don't have any special skills in the art of playing, their fighting spirit has always been the same, which is enough for each team to follow; if their skills are further honed, it will not be difficult to become a strong traveling team.</p>
<p>In the second battle, Guangdong continued their consistent style, defeating Nanjing by 8-5. The Guangdong team only has one battle left this morning against Gansu, which they should easily win, securing the long-term championship, and the softball championship has already become theirs.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The badminton exhibition match started at 7:00 PM last night at the City Gymnasium. Originally scheduled for eleven matches, only eight matches were held due to the absence of Guizhou players, with an additional Malaysia-China doubles performance. The Malaysia-China team, with the power of thunder, defeated all Hong Kong and Shanghai men's, women's, singles, doubles, and mixed players in an overwhelming manner, refreshing the eyes and ears of the Shanghai badminton community. It can be said to be the biggest win in this competition's exhibition match.</p>
<p>Malaysia-China's Playing Skills Are Excellent</p>
<p>In the two men's singles matches, Hong Dequan and Zheng Kunlin (Hong Kong team captain), who dominate Hong Kong and Shanghai, were defeated by Malaysia-China's Huang Bingxuan and Huang Defu respectively. The two Malaysia-China players are as still as a mountain, and as moving as a flowing river. Their hitting style is light and fast, coming and going unpredictably. They appear in front and suddenly are behind, causing Hong and Zheng to run around constantly, leaving them with no choice but to surrender. This is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai badminton.</p>
<p>Wonderful Performances: A Double Performance Was Added at the Last Minute; Two Huangs Collaborated to Battle Malaysia-China's Yang Decai and Huang Baolin; The Playing Skills of Both Sides Reached Their Peak; They Fought with All Their Might, So the Battle Was Thrilling; The Cheers from the Audience Never Stopped, Truly Creating a New Era for China's Badminton World. The Malaysia-China women's generals also completed their victories with ease. The results of last night's matches are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e120">From the Diving Board to the Poolside <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong</p>
<p>Army Major General Performs Diving; "Flying Legs" Famous for Backstroke</p>
<p>[Our Special Report] With the swimming scores repeatedly breaking records, the number of spectators by the swimming pool is also creating new records. Although the gate at the entrance is heavily guarded, all kinds of miscellaneous people have their own ways of getting in. Especially during the diving performance, the sides of the diving board are crowded with people, so the command platform had to announce a suspension and ask the military police to clear the idlers in the vicinity, so the diving performance, which was originally scheduled to start at 2:10 PM, was not able to continue until 3:10 PM.</p>
<p>During the stalemate, the reporter's loud voice broadcast from the microphone: "The referee cannot work, the performance cannot be held, please clear the spectators on the right side of the diving board." At this time, some people in the stands applauded, some booed loudly, and others cheered strangely.</p>
<p>Several non-diving athletes sat on another diving board suspended in mid-air next to them to watch, high above, very comfortable, but unexpectedly blocked the view of the spectators in the stands behind, and they were unanimously booed down. The results of the diving performance were not outstanding, and the lack of a mermaid to participate failed to satisfy the audience's expectations. In addition, both water polo performances were temporarily abandoned. When the meeting was dismissed, a gentleman was heard sighing: "Unlucky! I spent 400,000 just to bask in the sun for a day."</p>
<p>The quality of the posture is judged by three referees. Each person prepares six long-handled wooden boards painted with numbers one to six. After each performance, they each hold up one board to indicate the score they gave. However, the opinions of the three referees are very inconsistent. Once, two of them each rated two points, but the other rated five points, and the audience laughed.</p>
<p>Army athlete Deng Molin, who participated in the performance, is a major general, and the reporter gave him a solemn introduction.</p>
<p>The first place in the men's 100-meter backstroke semi-final, Feng Zhaoyu from Malaysia, has all the hair below his thighs, and can be called "Flying Legs" in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team broke the national record in the women's 200-meter relay race. The mother of the Huang sisters walked over with a smile to tell her girlfriend: "It broke the record again."</p>
<p>The Huang sisters, Gao, Ling, and Zeng Fengqun, the four relay race champions, were surrounded by photographers and autograph seekers after getting out of the water, and they were unable to cope. Just when they were embarrassed, the Hong Kong team leader "killed" into the crowd and escorted them out of the encirclement.</p>
<p>After a kind man asked them to sign the "brim" of his sports cap, he bragged to his friend: "This hat is full of fragrant names from the countries of women." He was very proud of himself.</p>
<p>Someone in the stands wriggled out of the railing and wanted to climb down. The command platform immediately stopped them loudly. The reporter first said: "People in the stands, don't jump down", and then added humorously in Sichuan dialect: "It's really not allowed!" The audience responded with laughter.</p>

<p>[Our Report] There are two men's volleyball round robin finals remaining, Guangzhou vs. Shanghai and Hong Kong vs. Police, which will still be held at the City Sports Field this morning.

According to the round-robin matches, Hong Kong has already scored four points. If they win against the police today, they will win the championship. In terms of strength, Hong Kong is above the police, while Guangzhou is stronger than Shanghai, so it is generally believed that Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Police, and Shanghai will be the top four teams of champion, runner-up, third place, and fourth place.</p>
<p>In terms of women's volleyball, there is still a match between Shanghai and Hunan. Because of a dispute, the match was suspended.

<p>Commodity prices, which had been calm for more than a month, have recently fluctuated dramatically again. Most commodity prices have risen by more than 50%. Starting on the 13th, the government authorities have taken effective measures to curb the price surge and stabilize people's livelihood. The other day, the national bank had a huge shortfall of more than 1,200 billion, and decided to continue tightening the money supply. In addition to allocating materials, it also sold off a large number of materials. Rice, flour, cotton yarn, sugar, etc. continued to be sold off. Tax collection is still scheduled for today, and the amount will still be recorded. The other day, because the money supply suddenly tightened, many banks and firms did not balance their books until after 12 o'clock at night. Yesterday, commodity prices were suppressed by this, and it was announced that they had returned to a small level, averaging about 20%.</p>
<p>[Our Report] This time, the price surge was fierce, and the authorities decided to take powerful measures to stabilize prices. However, the person in charge said that the rumor that the bank had stopped lending was untrue. Yesterday, commodity prices had already fallen back. According to the observation of relevant people, the money supply will become even tighter in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The People's Relief Commission Continues to Sell Rice, and the Market Is Gradually Stabilizing; Flour, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cakes All Fall Back <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Under the continuous sales of the People's Relief Commission, the rice market has shown signs of oversupply. Yesterday, the People's Relief Commission continued to sell in the North and South markets. The price of early rice sold in the South market was 5.45 million, but it sold very little, only 260 stones. The North market sold white japonica and indica rice. The price of white japonica was 5.5 million, and the price of indica was 5.3 million, with a total of 5,200 stones sold. Because of the tight money supply, the price of each commodity in free trading fell slightly, and the cargo owners sought to sell, but the sale was stagnant, and the price secretly fell by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. White japonica thin rice was 5.6 million, early rice was 5.5 million, and the arrival in the two markets was 5,970 stones.</p>
<p>Because the Central Trust Bureau continued to jointly sell flour with various factories, the price of various kinds of flour was reduced by 100,000 to 2 million yuan for delivery. However, because the money supply suddenly tightened, the tin price reported a small drop, and large households dumped it, the old car and soldier ships fell sharply from 2 million to 1.85 million yuan. Hongfeng Liancheng closed at 1.8 million, each falling by a huge amount of 270,000 to 300,000 yuan. Bran fell slightly by 120,000, and the factory price of wheat fell to 3 million, to 2.95 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Under the pressure of the tight money supply, cargo owners sold goods to realize cash, people's hearts were weak, and customers watched and did not buy. Soybeans fell sharply by 350,000 yuan. Corn and mung beans fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan each because customers did not buy them. Red sorghum fell by 200,000 yuan, and selected green transactions were sporadic. Sesame lacked a receiver and fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell sharply by 1 million to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The drop in edible oil was disastrous. Cargo owners took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and manufacturers also offered a lot. There was a lot of soybean oil on the market, opening at 13.5 million, and then falling to 12.5 million, a drop of 1.7 million yuan. Jiyitong raw oil also fell by 1.7 million yuan, raw rapeseed oil fell slightly by 1.5 million yuan, small car sesame oil fell by 2 million yuan, and soybean cake fell sharply by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou dispatch on the 14th] Today's rice prices in Suzhou continued to rise. The market price of rough japonica rice was 5 million yuan, and the price of white rice was 5.65 million yuan. The door-to-door negotiated price was 5.75 million yuan. The above are all inferior goods, and the superior white rice has disappeared from the market.</p>
<p>Changsha</p>
<p>[Our Changsha dispatch on the 13th] Changsha rice prices soared, rising by more than 2 million yuan in two weeks. The price of superior rice has broken the 4 million mark. Hengyang and Xiangtan are even higher than Changsha. Hunan is a rice-producing area, and the soaring price of grain is a hidden worry.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Taiwan Sugar Falls into the Allocated Price <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Because the money supply was tight yesterday, the trend of the sugar market softened. The association divided the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar into 9.45 million yuan at first, then 300,000 yuan less, and 350,000 yuan less. The price of four-and-a-half white sugar was still flat due to the scarcity of goods, remaining at 11.5 million yuan. The price of 20 medium sand white sugar fell from 9.12 million yuan to 8.9 million yuan. Special allocation of coarse white sugar was delivered immediately at 8.9 million yuan to 6.6 million yuan, already falling into the allocated price.</p>
<p>The exchange of warehouse receipts was also lower than the allocated price. The 20th period coarse white sugar was delivered immediately at 8.9 million yuan in the morning and 8.75 million yuan to 6.6 million yuan in the afternoon. The exchange of delivery slips today was 9.23 million yuan in the morning, dropping to 9 million yuan, and the minimum was 8.75 million yuan in the afternoon. Next week's first period was 8.88 million yuan.</p>
<p>Local sugar was relatively flat. Shantou refined sugar was 6 million yuan, slightly lower by 300,000 yuan. Xinghua white sugar was 8.89 million yuan, the second was 8.5 million yuan, and 450,000 yuan less. Xinghua red sugar was 6.35 million yuan, and Qing sugar was 5.1 million yuan, slightly lower by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Hainan red sugar of high quality was 6.05 million yuan, and the second was 5.85 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Foreign Stocks and Consolidated Bonds All Plummet <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds also fell back yesterday. Consolidated C opened at 270,000 in the morning, falling to 230,000, and then stabilized slightly. The turnover was only 4 million. Compared with the previous close, A and B fell by 28,000, Consolidated C fell by 47,000, Consolidated D fell slightly by 26,000, and Consolidated E also fell by 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were prohibited from being freely carried out of the country yesterday, and the provisions have been announced. Also, due to the control of Hong Kong exchange telecommunications, the price fell a lot. Yisha opened at 4.65 million in the morning, and fell back to the 4.4 million mark before closing. Turnover was not smooth due to surveillance. Foreign firm gangs and Guangdong gangs were in, while securities gangs and money exchange firms were out. Compared with the previous close, the paper version of British-linked stocks fell by 15%, and other stocks fell by 10% each.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Silk Prices Plunge Across the Board <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The artificial silk market continued its sharp decline yesterday. The No. 120 Jin San Ma brand was offered at around 390 million yuan in the morning, but market sentiment was weak, and the price dropped to as low as 60 million yuan. The immediate price recovered to 70 million yuan at noon, and the forward price was 78 million yuan. In the afternoon, the market remained weak, opening at 72 million yuan and falling to 57 million yuan at one point. The market recovered slightly at the close, reaching 73 million yuan, still down 40 million yuan from the previous day. Factory silk also experienced a significant drop yesterday. High-quality raw silk opened at 12 bundles, priced at 520 million yuan, but the asking price dropped to the 500 million yuan level in the afternoon. D-grade was offered at 510 million yuan, but actual sales remained cautious. Furthermore, the 19th installment for allocated silk was due yesterday, and goods would soon be available, resulting in unusually quiet trading.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics also declined yesterday. Huaqiang Real Silk quilt covers closed in the morning with the immediate price dropping to 190 million yuan, and the forward price at 91.3 million yuan. Dachang checkered crepe fabrics were around 670,000 yuan in the morning, but the market remained sluggish in the afternoon. Other fabrics experienced drops of about 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Banking Institutions Continue to Show Inward Flow, with Dark Interest at 29% <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's clearing of bills and notes in the banking industry showed an inward flow of 92.92 billion yuan from the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury. Foreign banks also showed an inward flow of 42.05 billion yuan, leading to tight credit conditions. Among banking institutions, only the Bank of Communications showed a slight outward flow, while all others showed inward flows. The Bank of China had the largest inward flow due to receipts from yarn, cloth, and flour payments, totaling 45.85 billion yuan. The Central Bank showed an inward flow of 24.02 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications an outward flow of 5 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank an inward flow of 6.13 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau an inward flow of 10.85 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau an inward flow of 1.19 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury an inward flow of 5.36 billion yuan.

<h3 id="e131">Severe Environment, Tight Credit, Yarn and Cloth Prices Fall <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was effectively halted due to the authorities' investigation of yarn merchants' accounts and summons of responsible individuals on the previous afternoon and morning. Only off-market offers existed, and there was no standard market price. Buyer demand weakened, and sellers continued to sell, leading to lower asking prices. 21-count Shuangma yarn was offered as low as 220 million yuan. Later, with the China Textile Construction Corporation (CTCC) re-listing its yarn sales, offering fifteen types of coarse and fine yarns, the prices fell further. 21-count Shuangma yarn was offered at 200.8 million yuan, and 42-count Lanfeng yarn at 327 million yuan. Compared to the previous day's market, coarse and fine yarns across the board saw price drops ranging from 8.9 million to 24.5 million yuan. The cotton cloth market also suffered yesterday, as the authorities rigorously investigated yarn and cloth merchants, and the CTCC supplied large quantities of goods, leading to a sudden tightening of credit in the market. Gold notes declined, and yarn prices were lower, creating anxiety. Various parties rushed to sell. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially plummeted by 350,000 yuan. However, bargain hunters emerged, and short covering drove the price back up to 6.73 million yuan. Around 10:00 AM, merchants from Shanxi and Hankou, along with cloth merchants, raced to sell, causing a sharp drop to 6.58 million yuan, but there were few buyers. Near the close, market sentiment seemed stable, and prices rebounded to close at 6.6 million yuan, down 400,000 yuan from the previous day. Apart from 190 Shilin cloth, which remained firm, all other types of cloth experienced price declines. Ultimately, Longtou fine cloth saw even more fear, and spot offers fell to 6.5 million yuan, with sellers willing to sell at that price.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CTCC's Longtou fine cloth permits were trading at a discount of 200,000 to 250,000 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bi ji was trading at a discount of 450,000 yuan, at 6.41 million yuan, with transactions occurring. Finally, it was trading at a discount of 300,000 yuan, and market sentiment appeared weak.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Soybeans Exported in Batches to Repay Japanese Debt <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The total amount of barter trade between China and Japan, managed by the China Trust Bureau, is estimated at around 40 million US dollars. The value of goods imported from Japan is about 25 million US dollars, while Chinese exports are only 15 million US dollars. Therefore, China has an overdraft of 10 million US dollars on the books, which needs to be balanced by exports. Recently, China shipped 2,100 tons of soybeans at a price of 172 US dollars per ton to repay the debt. In the short term, there are plans to ship 4,000 tons of soybeans and other goods from North China to Japan in batches to clear the entire debt. In the past, the Allied Economic Group had used the overdraft of this barter trade as an excuse to hinder the progress of Sino-Japanese private trade. Now, it is understood that an understanding has been reached, and the accounts of the two will be handled separately.</p>

<p>The Central Bank has decided to simultaneously issue short-term treasury bills in major cities such as Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Nanjing. The bank has notified its five branches in Tianjin, Chongqing, and other locations to proceed accordingly. Regarding the determination of interest rates, the bank has authorized the managers of each branch to decide based on local conditions, without the need to establish a separate interest rate committee. The principal and interest on treasury bills sold in each location can only be redeemed in that location and cannot be transferred to other regions for redemption.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Camel Hair Industry Association is being reorganized by order, with Chairman Chen Youyun and others responsible for the preparations. This has now been completed, and a general meeting of members will be held on the 20th of this month at the Atlantic Restaurant on Sima Road to report on association affairs and amend the articles of association.</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhongkai and Hai ships arrived in port yesterday and the day before, respectively. They brought 4,000 tons of pig iron from Qinhuangdao, which were unloaded at Pier No. 8. Regarding the recent request from cotton merchants for the Yarn Tube Committee to increase the cotton purchase working capital fund, the committee has agreed to consider it. It is said that the key issue is the large difference between the purchase price and the market price. The date for the issuance of shares by the China Textile Construction Corporation is currently awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan's Committee on the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises. Due to the establishment of the new cabinet, it will take some time, and it is unlikely that the issuance will occur this month.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Sharp Decline in Chinese Stocks, Slight Rebound at Closing Due to Short Covering <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were simultaneously plagued by both external and internal troubles yesterday, and selling pressure easily overwhelmed the market, leading to an uncontrollable decline. External stimuli were completely nullified, and market sentiment collapsed, but there was a slight rebound due to short covering at the close.</p>
<p>The market was weak from the start due to concerns about tight credit and unfavorable conditions. Yong Yarn opened low at 2860 yuan and retreated to 2705 yuan. It then rose to 2775 yuan, but sellers continued to flood in. Although brokerage fees were offered at 23 yuan and 27 yuan, the price still declined to 2710 yuan. No. 154 and others came in to absorb the selling, and the price recovered to 2775 yuan. No. 207, No. 65, No. 157, and No. 137 temporarily sold off, and off-market sentiment was bearish. Hong Kong Electric also fell. Near noon, the price dropped to a low of 2705 yuan, and it closed at 2730 yuan at noon. Except for Qinxing's new shares, which rose to the limit on their first day of trading, Xinyi fell by 10%, and Yong Yarn, Xinyi, Huafeng, Datong, and Jinglun fell by 5%, while the rest experienced slight declines.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yong Yarn opened slightly higher at 2780 yuan. However, a major account experienced problems with margin calls, causing panic to return, and a wave of selling soon began, driving the price down to a low of 2640 yuan. National banks showed significant inward flows, but they gradually covered their short positions, pushing the price up to 2750 yuan. No. 157, No. 197, and No. 183 sold again at 2710 yuan. No. 95, No. 22, and No. 232 held steady, and the market closed at 2725 yuan. The gains were significant, with Qinxing and Lianhua rising to the limit compared to the morning close. China Silk rose by 5%, as did Jingfu and Meiya. Rongfeng, Xinhua, Zhabei, Commerce, Jinglun, Huafeng, and Xinguang China-France rose slightly, while the rest experienced slight declines. Off-market, unlisted stocks retreated by about 5%.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Rhyme Categories in the Five Dynasties Printed Edition of the Qieyun <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zumo</p>
<p>There are two extant rhyme charts from the Five Dynasties printed edition of the Qieyun: one is a fragment of a page in the collection of the Prussian Academy in Germany, containing characters from the "Han" and "Huan" rhymes of the level tone, obtained by Le Coq from Xinjiang, numbered T, L1015; the other is a set of seventeen pages obtained by Paul Pelliot from Dunhuang, which belong to this type of Qieyun, now preserved in the National Library of France. Each plate has side margins and dividing lines, and the number of plates is recorded at the end of each plate, which differs from the Song Dynasty woodblock books, which record the information in a line at the center of the plate. These seventeen pages were divided into four numbers by Pelliot: "2014," "2015," "4747," and "5531." The last page of "2014" is titled "Da Tang Kan Miu Bu Que Qieyun Yi Bu" (A Complete Qieyun of the Great Tang Dynasty with Errors Corrected and Omissions Filled), with other markings. There are nine pages of 2014, three pages of 2015, one page of 4747, and four pages of 5531. The rhyme categories preserved in each are as follows:</p>
<p>2014-3 Contains characters from the "Dong" and "Dong" rhymes</p>
<p>2014-4 Contains characters from the "Yu" and "Yu" rhymes</p>
<p>2014-6 Contains characters from the "Xian," "Xuan," and "Xiao" rhymes</p>
<p>2014-5 Contains characters from the "Xiao" rhyme</p>
<p>2014-8 Contains characters from the "Xiao" and "Hao" rhymes</p>
<p>2014-7 Contains characters from the "Qin" and "Yan" rhymes</p>
<p>2014-9 Contains characters from the "Zhi" rhyme</p>
<p>2014-2 Contains characters from the "Huan," "Shan," "Chan," and "Xian" rhymes</p>
<p>2014-1 Contains characters from the "Zhi" and "De" rhymes</p>
<p>2015-3 Contains characters from the "Dong," "Dong," and "Zhong" rhymes</p>
<p>2015-2 Contains characters from the "Qi," "Jia," "Jie," and "Hui" rhymes</p>
<p>2015-1 Contains characters from the "He," "Qia," "Xia," "Ye," and "Tie" rhymes</p>
<p>4747 Fragment Contains characters from the "Dong" rhyme</p>
<p>5531-2 Contains characters from the "Wei" and "Yu" rhymes</p>
<p>5531-1 Contains characters from the "Xie," "Hai," and "Hui" rhymes</p>
<p>5531-3 Contains characters from the "Xue," "Xue," and "Xi" rhymes</p>
<p>5531-4 Contains characters from the "Xi," "Mai," and "Mo" rhymes</p>
<p>The characters in these four numbers are quite different. After careful examination, they can be roughly divided into five types:</p>
<p>(1) The pages 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 of "2014" and "4747" belong to one type.</p>
<p>(2) Page 3 of "2015" belongs to one type.</p>
<p>(3) Page 4 of "2014," pages 2 of "2015," and pages 1 and 2 of "5531" belong to one type.</p>
<p>(4) Page 6 of "2014" and pages 3 and 4 of "5531" belong to one type.</p>
<p>(5) Page 1 of "2014" and page 1 of "2015" belong to one type.</p>
<p>The second and sixth of these six types are most easily distinguished from the rest. The first type has dense annotations and vigorous strokes, which is different from the fourth and fifth types, which have sparse annotations and soft strokes. The third type has rather clumsy characters and blunt strokes, which is the worst. Compared with the other types, it is not difficult to distinguish their merits. Since the fragment in the collection of Germany is only one page, let us leave it aside for now. However, since the seventeen pages mentioned above are relatively numerous, it is necessary to investigate whether they are all from the same book.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the plate style: In the first type, page 3 of "2014" contains characters from the "Dong" and "Dong" rhymes on the upper and lower plates, and neither the beginning nor the end is complete. The upper plate is a handwritten replacement page, preserving the last eight lines, with the title "Second Plate" at the end. The lower plate is connected to the previous plate, starting with the character "Hong" in the first line and ending with the "Guai" initial, and it is woodcut, with eighteen lines. The upper part of each line from the sixth to the seventeenth is damaged. It turns out that the missing part is the fragment numbered "4747" by Pelliot, originally a leaf split into two. From the nineteenth line onward, it is again a handwritten replacement leaf, with twelve lines. Together with the previous lines, there are thirty lines in total. Page 3 of the second type, "2015," contains characters from the "Dong," "Dong," and "Zhong" rhymes, with nineteen lines, and the title "Third Plate" at the end. The characters and annotations collected on the lower plate are exactly the same as those of the previous type, so the two should be from the same book but different printed editions. The missing parts before and after can be complemented accordingly. The entire plate has thirty-four lines. In addition, in the first type, pages 2, 5, 7, and 9 of "2014" have the same plate style and characters. What remains is the end of the upper plate and the beginning of the lower plate, but the number of lines varies. The first and last parts of page 2 are incomplete in the photo, and the number of lines preserved seems to be slightly more. Without seeing the original object, it is impossible to speculate. Page 8 has fifteen lines, and it is very clear that it comes from the same plate as page 5. This is the general situation of the first and second types.</p>
<p>Pages 4 of the third type, "2014," and 1 and 2 of "5531" also contain the end of the upper plate and the beginning of the lower plate. However, page 2 of "2015" is a complete plate with thirty-four lines, which is the same as the number of lines per plate in the previous two types.</p>
<p>As for the fourth type, page 6 of "2014" only contains twenty-seven lines, while page 3 of "5531" contains thirty-four lines. Although there is some damage, it is definitely a complete plate. Page 4 of the same number only contains the last thirty lines, and the first four lines are still missing. Page 1 of the fifth type, "2014," contains the last sixteen lines of a plate, while page 1 of "2015" is a complete plate with thirty-four lines. Therefore, although the characters of these five types are different, they all have thirty-four lines per plate, which is well-known.</p>
<p>As for the system of these five printed editions, they are not completely the same. Roughly speaking:</p>
<p>(1) Page 3 of "2014," pages 2 and 3 of "2015," and page 1 of "4747" all have explanations listed before and fanqie (a type of phonetic transcription) after each initial. There are very few exceptions.</p>
<p>(2) Pages 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of "2014" and pages 1 and 2 of "5531" have the fanqie either before or after the explanations, which is not uniform. However, it is a common practice to have the fanqie before the explanation for the first initial of each rhyme (except for the "Chan" rhyme).</p>
<p>(3) In pages 1 of "2014," 1 of "2015," and pages 3 and 4 of "5531," the fanqie is always before the explanation, without exception.</p>
<p>Based on this, although the number of lines on the plates of these five printed editions is the same, their systems are still different and cannot be confused.</p>
<p>Now, let us further examine the content: The first and second types have the same line style and content for the "Dong" and "Dong" rhymes, so they should be regarded as one book, as mentioned earlier. If we combine the third and fourth types, the level tone rhyme categories that have numbers in the first type are: 2 Dong, 35 Hao, and 51 Yan. In the second type, it is: 2 Dong and 3 Zhong. In the third type, it is: 10 Yu, 13 Jia, 14 Jie, and 15 Hui. In the fourth type, it is: 31 Xuan and 32 Xiao. Based on this, we know that the rhyme system of these four types is completely consistent. The order of the level tone rhymes should be:</p>
<p>1 Dong, 2 Dong, 3 Zhong, 4 Jiang, 5 Zhi, 6 Zhi, 7 Zhi, 8 Wei, 9 Yu, 10 Chu, 11 Mo, 12 Qi, 13 Jia, 14 Jie, 15 Hui, 16 He, 17 Zhen, 18 Chun, 19 Zhen, 20 Wen, 21 Yin, 22 Yuan, 23 Hun, 24 Hen, 25 Han, 26 Huan, 27 Shan, 28 Shan, 29 Xian, 30 Xian, 31 Xuan, 32 Xiao, 33 Xiao, 34 Xiao, 35 Hao, 36 Ge, 37 Ge, 38 Ma, 39 Tan, 40 Tan, 41 Yang, 42 Tang, 43 Geng, 44 Geng, 45 Qing, 46 Qing, 47 You, 48 Hou, 49 You, 50 Qin, 51 Yan, 52 Tian, 53 Zheng, 54 Deng, 55 Xian, 56 Xian, 57 Yan, 58 Fan, totaling fifty-eight rhymes.</p>
<p>Although this is a conjecture, only in this way can we know that Xuan starts with thirty-one and Xiao starts with thirty-two in the fourth type, Hao starts with thirty-five in the first type, and Yan starts with fifty-one. Otherwise, if we say that the rhyme categories of the first and fourth types are different, with "Yi" after "Qi," no "Xuan" after "Xian," and the "Yan" rhyme also being "fifty-one," then it would not match the rhyme categories of the third type, which is unlikely. Moreover, the order of these rhyme categories from 35 Hao to 51 Yan is arranged according to the old order of the Qieyun by Lu Fayan. Although there is no concrete evidence, considering that the order of the entering tone categories in this type of rhyme book is still consistent with the old order of Fayan (see below for details), the level tone should also be based on Lu's system and not have been changed again. If this argument is not wrong, then although the printing plates of the first, second, third, and fourth types are different, the rhyme categories are undoubtedly the same.</p>
<p>As for the fourth type, although the systems of the level and entering tones are different, one has the Xuan rhyme in the level tone (2014-6), and the other has the Xue rhyme in the entering tone (5531-3). Xuan is the rounded-lip version of Xian, and Xue is the rounded-lip version of Xue. The classification of level and entering tones can correspond accordingly. In the Xue rhyme, under the Quan initial, there is the character "Chuan," annotated as: "Fine cloth. Also read as Zhi Quan fan." The character "Chuan" under the Quan initial of the Xuan rhyme has the same explanation and the correct pronunciation "Zhi Quan fan." This consistency is unlikely to be accidental. This probably indicates that the two printed editions belong to the same system of books.</p>
<p>As for the entering tone category of the fourth type and the fifth type, the systems are the same, but it is not easy to know whether they are from the same book. If we look at the number of rhyme categories, even if they are two printed editions of different books, the rhyme categories must be consistent. This is because the entering tone rhyme categories that have numbers in the fifth type are 26 Qia, 27 Xia, 28 Ye, and 29 Tie, 34 De. Before the Qia rhyme, there is also the He rhyme character, so He is 25. Before the De rhyme, there is also the Zhi rhyme character, so Zhi is 33. This numbering is only seen in the Tang Dynasty rhyme books. As for what the rhyme categories are before and after, it cannot be deduced without the fourth type of printed edition. The rhyme categories that have numbers in the fourth type are 10 Xue, 11 Xi, 22 Mai, and 23 Mo. However, before this Mai rhyme, there is also the Xi rhyme character. If Xi is 21, then the numbers for Xue and Xi do not match. If Xi is 22, then the numbers for Mai and Mo do not match. The numbers for either Xue and Xi or Mai and Mo must be wrong. Now, if we examine the third type (S.2071) of Wang's handwritten annotations and the Tang rhyme printed by Jiang Futou, the rhymes after Xi, Mai, and Mo in the entering tone are all He, Qia, Xia, Ye, Tie, Ji, , Duo, Zhi, De, Ye, Fa and other rhymes. If we follow this order, then 33 Zhi in the fifth type should be preceded by 32 Duo, 31 Yao, and 30 Ji, and 25 He should be preceded by 24 He, 23 Mo, and 22 Mai. Since the Mai and Mo rhymes are 22 and 23, the numbers for the Mai and Mo rhymes in the fourth type should not be wrong. The error is probably in the Xue and Xi rhymes. If we examine the rhyme categories above the Xue rhyme, there are not enough to make twenty. According to Sun Mian's Tang rhyme, there are only 17 rhymes from "Wu" to "Xue." If this printed edition has a "Yu" rhyme after the "Zhi" rhyme, as in the rhyme book cited by Xia Song's Guwen Sisheng Yun, then there are only 18 rhymes from Wu to Xue. The number for the Xue rhyme would only be 19, so it cannot be 20 either. This proves that there is an error in the numbers for Xue and Xi. Now, if we fix Xue as 19 and Xi as 20, then everything is consistent. Let's try to put the numbers in order as follows:</p>
<p>1 Wu, 2 Wo, 3 Zhu, 4 Jue, 5 Zhi, 6 Yu, 7 Shu, 8 Wu, 9 Zhi, 10 Qi, 11 Yue, 12 Mo, 13 He, 14 Mo, 15 Xia, 16 Xia, 17 Xie, 18 Xue, 19 Xue, 20 Xi, 21 Xi, 22 Mai, 23 Mo, 24 He (followed by 25 He, 26 Qia, 27 Xia, 28 Ye, 29 Tie of the fourth type. Further down are 30 Ji, 31 Yao, 32 Duo, 33 Zhi, 34 De, 35 Ye, 36 Fa—a total of 36 rhymes.)</p>
<p>Now that the order of the fourth type is clear, the order of the rhyme categories in the fifth type can also be obtained. By comparing the two, they can be connected. The fourth and fifth types are again a system of books.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the fifth type of printed edition, in the Qia rhyme, under the Qia initial, there is the character "Tao," annotated as: "Claw Tao. Also read as Ta Dao fan." If we examine the first type, page 8 of "2014," under the Dao initial of the Hao rhyme, there is exactly the character "Tao" under "Ta Dao fan," and the fanqie matches completely. Although this is a small detail, it is by no means accidental. The sound "Ta Dao" in the Hao rhyme is cut into Tu Hao fan, Xiang Ba's version and the Dunhuang version of Wang's rhyme make it Tu Gao fan, and the Song Ba version of Wang's rhyme makes it Tu Gao fan, but it is never Ta Dao. The entering fanqie of the fifth type and the level fanqie of the first type are exactly the same. The two are also books of the same type.</p>
<p>To summarize, these five different printed editions are not from the same book, but in terms of their content, the rhyme divisions are undoubtedly the same. Wei Jiangong mentioned this matter in his article "The Evolution of the System of Rhyme Books in the Tang and Song Dynasties" (published in the National Studies Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 1), which was written in the 20th year of the Republic of China. At that time, Pelliot's "5531" pages were not yet known, and it was not until the 25th year that Wang Yousan sent back photos from Paris, so I was able to make a copy. Last year, I received photos of Pelliot's "4747" from Wang Yousan, and after comparing and collating them, I further proved the teacher's theory, and I became more convinced that the teacher's brilliant insights were unattainable. Now, I have compared and collated the rhyme categories of the four tones of this type of rhyme book as follows: Level, Rising, and Departing Tones</p>
<p>1 Dong Dong Song 18 Chun Zhun Zhu 39 Tan Gan Kan</p>
<p>2 Dong Song 19 Zhen 40 Tan Gan</p>
<p>3 Zhong Zhong Yong 20 Wen Wen Wen 41 Yang Yang Yang</p>
<p>4 Jiang Jiang Jiang 21 Yin Yin Yin 42 Tang Dang Dang</p>
<p>5 Zhi Zhi 22 Yuan Ruan Yuan 43 Geng Geng Jing</p>
<p>6 Zhi Zhi Zhi 23 Hun Hun 44 Geng Geng Zheng</p>
<p>7 Zhi Zhi Zhi 24 Hen Hen Hen 45 Qing Jing Jing</p>
<p>8 Wei Wei Wei 25 Han Han Han 46 Qing Jiong Jing</p>
<p>9 Yu Yu Yu 26 Huan Huan 47 You You</p>
<p>10 Chu Yu 27 Shan Shan Jian 48 Hou Hou Hou</p>
<p>11 Mo Mu Mu 28 Shan Chan 49 You You You</p>
<p>Tai 29 Xian Xian 50 Qin Qin Qin</p>
<p>12 Qi 30 Xian Xian 51 Yan Yan</p>
<p>Ji 31 Xuan Xuan 52 Tian Tian</p>
<p>13 Jia Gua Xiao Tiao Xiao Zheng Zheng</p>
<p>14 Jie Hai Guai 33 Xiao Xiao Xiao 54 Deng Deng</p>
<p>15 Hui Dui 34 Yao Qiao Xiao 55 Xian Xian Xian</p>
<p>16 Hai Dai 35 Hao Hao Hao 56 Xian Kan</p>
<p>Fei 36 Ge Ge Jian 57 Yan Yan</p>
<p>17 Zhen Zhen Zhen 38 Ma Ma 58 Fan Fan Fan</p>
<p>Entering Tone</p>
<p>Wu Wo Zhu Jue Zhi Yu Shu Wu Zhi Qi Yue Mo He Mo Xia Xia Xie Xue Xue Xi Xi Mai Mo He He Qia Xia Ye Tie Ji Yao Zhi De Ye Fa</p>
<p>There are 58 rhymes in the level tone, 56 rhymes in the rising tone, 60 rhymes in the departing tone, and 36 rhymes in the entering tone. This is the largest number of rhyme divisions seen in the study of rhyming today. Moreover, its division into rhyme categories is the closest to the Tang Qieyun cited by Xia Song's Guwen Sisheng Yun and should be a rhyme book of the same system as the late Tang Dynasty. However, Xia Song's level tone has the Yi rhyme after the Qi rhyme and the Xuan rhyme after the Xian rhyme, with a total of 59 rhymes. This has Xuan but no Yi, so it is one rhyme short. In the entering tone, Xia Song has the Yu rhyme but no Xue rhyme, with a total of 35 rhymes. This has the Xue rhyme, so it is one rhyme more. The rhyme categories of the two have slight differences and are not completely the same. However, Xia Song's rising tone has the Xuan rhyme, while this has the Xuan and Xue rhymes in the level and entering tones, so this rising tone should also have the Xuan rhyme. Moreover, the fanqie of the rhyme categories in this printed edition, such as Yu and Yu both have Huan fan, Huan has Guan fan, Chan has Suo Jian fan, and Xian has Xian Dian fan, is different from the three versions of Wang's rhyme but the same as Xia Song's, which also proves that the two books are similar. However, the three initials Gong, Zhong, and Cong in this printed edition are all in the Dong rhyme, while the characters Gong, Zhong, etc., in Xia Song's book are in the Dun rhyme. One is based on Fayan, and the other is based on Sun Mian, and the selection of materials may have differed occasionally.</p>
<p>In the past, Wang Guowei once said: "The Tang Dynasty rhyme books, in terms of rhyme categories, are the same system as Lu Fayan's Qieyun, Sun Mian's Tang Yun, Xiao Xu's Shuowen Jiezi Zhuan Yunpu, and the rhyme book cited by Xia Yinggong's Guwen Sisheng Yun" (see Wang Guowei's Guantang Jilin, Volume 8, Li Zhou Qieyun Kao). That statement is correct. If we look at the divisions and combinations of rhyme classes, after Lu Fayan's Qieyun, Wang Renxu's Qieyun is in one category, Sun Mian's Tang Yun is in one category, and Xiao Xu's Shuowen Zhuan Yunpu and the rhyme book cited by Guwen Sisheng Yun, as well as this type of Five Dynasties printed edition of Qieyun, are in one category. The rhyme categories of Lu's rhyme book are based on the rhyme books of various schools of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. However, in the early stages of creation, there may have been incomplete analysis, so there have been subsequent additions since Wang Renxu. Lu's rhyme book lacks the rising and departing tones, which Wang Renxu added. Lu's book originally treated the open and closed categories of the four tones of the Zhen, Han, and Ge rhymes as one rhyme, but Sun Mian analyzed them. As it gradually evolved to this type of Five Dynasties printed edition of Qieyun, the distinctions became finer and the classifications more strict. Tracing back to its origins, it all started with Wang Renxu. Therefore, the title of this book, "Da Tang Kan Miu Bu Que Qieyun" (A Complete Qieyun of the Great Tang Dynasty with Errors Corrected and Omissions Filled), is sufficient to show its origins.

<h3 id="e137">Fundamental Problems of Indian Grammar Theory (Part 1) <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Keming</p>
<p>The Sanskrit grammar text of the ancient Indian sage Panini, the so-called "Eight Chapters," is a remarkable book unmatched in the world, past and present. It is not only ancient, dating back more than two thousand years, but its form is also condensed into nearly four thousand algebraic formula-like verses, containing the entirety of the complex transformations of Sanskrit. Regarding the "Voice Master" mentioned in Volume 2 of the "Records of the Western Regions," and this book, which cannot be explained in a short essay and is mostly only touched upon in ordinary language books, I cannot discuss it further here. I only wish to explore the starting point of the theory upon which this grammar system of the ancestor of grammar studies in India for more than two thousand years is based. This may be of some help in understanding grammar studies and even Indian thought.</p>
<p>However, I must first briefly point out the characteristics of this grammar text. This can be divided into two aspects: First, it does not distinguish word classes and syntax according to semantics, but only analyzes the composition and changes of words and their connections according to morphology through sound changes. It only explains inflections (Accidence) and word formation. In addition, it includes all the "sandhi" rules of Sanskrit. Its own strictly organized grammar system is based on the observation and analysis of language phenomena, knowing only sounds. The Sanskrit word for grammar, "Vyakarana," also means analysis. Second, it focuses on the determination of the standard advanced common language (bhasa) of the time, and does not focus on the explanation of the ancient Vedic language (Chandas). It is also constrained by the habit of oral transmission through verses, so it reconstructs the results analyzed from the phenomena into a special logical system. At the same time, it follows the highest principle of brevity and conciseness and compiles a rhyme book that is difficult to reduce by even half a syllable. Readers, in addition to already understanding Sanskrit (which was not a problem at the time of writing the book), must first understand its special form, then discover its system, and then they can see that it is indeed based on long-term, meticulous analysis of language phenomena. Therefore, it has become an extremely difficult book to read, said to require twelve years of study.</p>
<p>Now, let me briefly describe its system: Apart from the "sandhi" rules between words, it is only an analysis of words, not of sentences. Therefore, inflection and word formation are compiled together. The nature of words is also not classified logically according to semantics, but only distinguished according to the phenomenon (sound) of morphology. Words are roughly divided into two categories: those that change and those that do not. Among those that change, the initial changes are noun endings and verb endings, and further changes are the formation of word stems that do not distinguish between nouns and verbs. The main component in this formation is the root analyzed to the end, the so-called "dhatu." What is added to the "dhatu" to make it a word, or to express all kinds of relationships such as nouns and verbs, are all "pratyayas." Here, it can be clearly seen that the "pratyaya" of a verb can be directly added to the "dhatu," while the "pratyaya" of a noun is always added after the "dhatu" has been added by another kind of "pratyaya," becoming various nouns and even adjectives, forming a compound word. It is obvious that only the root of the verb is ultimate. According to its terminology, the "pratyaya" of a verb is "tin," and verb inflection is based on "tin" as the ending, which is the old Chinese translation of "tinganta"; the "pratyaya" of nouns, adjectives, etc. is "sup," and its inflection is called "subanta." However, it originally did not care about the semantic distinction between nouns and verbs, regardless of part of speech, only distinguishing endings.</p>
<p>Since the analysis of words has reached the ultimate root, "dhatu," then grammar uses the "dhatu" as the basis to re-establish the rules of real language. If we talk about the analysis of phenomena, "dhatu" is the result; if we talk about the system of grammar, it is the starting point. Whether the "dhatupatha" attached to the Sanskrit grammar text, that is, the "collection of root explanations," is reliable; whether Panini's method and its results still have value from the perspective of modern people's knowledge and thought; etc., are still topics of much debate among modern European and American scholars, and cannot be discussed here. After briefly explaining the above facts, I will explore the theory about the root. As mentioned earlier, this theory is both the result of grammatical research and the starting point of the grammatical system.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Confucianism and Chivalry <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Han Feizi's "Five Moths" and "Prominent Schools" both say that in the Warring States period, Confucianism and Chivalry were the two most popular schools of thought. "Confucians disrupt the law with literature, and chivalrous individuals violate prohibitions with arms." Roughly speaking in today's words, it means those who use pens and those who use guns. At that time, the representatives of the gun-wielding class were the military strategists. Mozi advocated non-aggression, that is, specializing in redressing grievances. In order to realize his redressing of grievances, he had to accumulate his own strength in preparation for "armed mediation." Therefore, when Gongshuban was building cloud ladders for Chu to attack Song, Mozi could travel hundreds of miles with layered baggage and breathlessly run to the State of Chu to threaten the King of Chu. According to recent evidence, Mozi's disciples were organized and had a strong force, just like a religious group.</p>
<p>Confucianism is not like that. According to Hu Shih's research, Confucianism is synonymous with words such as "ru" (濡), "nuo" (懦), etc., meaning soaked, slow, and weak. Therefore, the inscription on the cauldron of Zheng Kao Fu has the words "bow at the first command, and stoop at the second command," fully expressing the tune of a slave. Whether this statement is true or not need not be discussed first, but it is a fact that Confucianists have always appeared in history as helpmates.</p>
<p>However, the emperors also looked down on Confucian scholars for this reason. Qin Shihuang did not understand political tactics well. He took that group of monsters who appeared to be Confucian scholars but acted like alchemists, brought them under Mount Li, and buried them all at once, causing a public outcry and becoming a case of eternal sin. The Han Dynasty was not like that. With Uncle Sun Tong, a descendant of the sage learning of the State of Lu, they naturally studied the psychology of intellectuals very thoroughly. Rather than killing them with a quick knife, it is better to use anesthetics. Thus, a Taixue doctoral student was enough for people like Liu Xin to fight desperately for, and a slight examination could make people like Dong Zhongshu dedicate their three years of study behind closed curtains. It is like throwing a meat bone down, and a hundred dogs wag their tails and bark and fight for it. It is truly ridiculous and pitiful. May I ask, what is the difference between the imperial examinations and fame since the Song and Yuan dynasties and this? The biggest difference is that the method is more complete and the net is more widespread.</p>
<p>In order to express themselves, Confucianists naturally had to eliminate "chivalry." Dong's dismissal of the Hundred Schools and honoring of Confucian scholars was a trump card. At the beginning of the Han Dynasty, there were still wandering chivalrous individuals with sincerity and courage, such as Zhu Jia and Guo Jie, who were of some help to Liu Bang's founding of the country. However, by the time of Emperor Wu, they were all eradicated. In this way, the emperor could live for ten thousand years without any worries, but the vitality of the country was also greatly weakened from then on.</p>
<p>Before humanity reaches the world of great harmony, it always needs a kind of opposing stability, that is to say, if there can be multiple forces in society that can check and supervise each other, it can certainly reduce many dark sides. We find novels like "Three Heroes and Five Gallants" very enjoyable, which represents the lack of these brave men who kill the poor, rob the rich, and aid the poor in society. "Water Margin" has such magic in society also because of this reason. Watching "The Pacification of Bandits" feels full of pent-up anger and makes no sense at all. Although Confucianists have seized a monopolistic position and power in society, they are often despised by the people and are not as popular as chivalrous individuals. This is because the Confucianists' own performance leads to the path of decline everywhere.</p>
<p>Mencius praised Tang and Wu and scolded Jie and Zhou as common men, which also has the meaning of chivalry, but the traditional view of the struggle between schools often obscures the bright side of truth, so the theories of Yang and Mo were greatly rejected. Later generations did not know how to promote their revolutionary ideas, but instead specially picked the emperor's welcome theory of respecting the monarch to chew on endlessly, which can be said to be extremely unreasonable! Accumulated brokenness will last a long time, and everywhere there are soaked and weak Confucians, and no longer see the strong and striving chivalrous individuals. The monarch and his ministers collude with each other, plus eunuchs and foreign relatives, there must be great chaos in the world and people will not be able to live. Historical facts are innumerable. It seems that Mr. Hu Hanmin once wrote an article saying that China has Confucianism but no Chivalry, which is a major shortcoming in thought. Looking at it today, doesn't it make people feel something again? The suffering of the people always needs to find an opportunity to vent. If it can be resolved sporadically, or it may not be like a mountain torrent breaking a dam, once it breaks out, it cannot be contained. This is also a way to draw firewood from under the pot. Therefore, fully developing the spirit of chivalry among the people (not the kind in "The Swordsman of Mount Emei," please don't misunderstand!), and cultivating students' sense of justice more when reading, may be a third of the way to healing a seven-year illness?</p>
<h3 id="e143">Shi Zhaoji Resides in the United States <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Reading Ling Xiaohan's "Talk Collection" in this newspaper on May 11, there was much nostalgia for Shi Zhaoji, a senior figure in the diplomatic world, saying that there was a rumor that he had returned to Daoshan (died). Recently, I received a single copy from the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development sent from the United States introducing the bank's general situation. On the page before the back cover, Shi's name is prominently listed in the list of consultants to the bank, in addition to Hoover of the United States and Sir Salter of the United Kingdom. According to reports, the Advisory Group has a total of nine consultants, elected at the Second Annual Meeting of the Bank's Board of Governors held in London in September 1947, with a term of two years. Shi is currently still serving in this position. The address of the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development is in Washington, D.C., USA, and Shi is currently residing in the United States. All those who care about Shi Weng (elderly man) can rest assured and send their blessings to Shi. (Jin Jin)</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Sorrow of an American President <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Chuang</p>
<p>The President of the United States is in a high position and holds great power, handling ten thousand matters every day. There is no such thing as leisure in life. When adversity comes, you cannot get rid of it, and after exhausting your efforts to deal with it in all directions, you may only attract more disputes.</p>
<p>The late American journalist H.H. Kohslaat had a prominent position in the political world during his lifetime and was highly respected by the Republicans at the time. Kohslaat participated in many important decisions within the party. According to Kohslaat, the President is actually something that can be done but should not be done.</p>
<p>One night, he went to the White House to visit President McKinley. The President said with great sadness: "For the past two weeks, I have never been able to sleep more than three hours a night. The parliament must force us to declare war on Spain. In fact, the Spanish fleet has already entered the territorial waters of Cuba in South America, and we are completely unprepared. We don't even have the ammunition to fire a salute on the Atlantic coast!"</p>
<p>The President said this, worried and anxious, and actually cried like a teenager!</p>
<p>Kohslaat silently put his hand on the President's shoulder without saying a word, but the President shed tears like a spring, unable to restrain his grief. Gradually, the President recovered. Kohslaat wanted to comfort him and said: "In this extraordinary period, any measures taken by the President will surely be supported by the whole country."</p>
<p>But the President did not answer. He just raised his head and asked Kohslaat: "Are my eyes red? Will others see that I have just cried?"</p>
<p>Kohslaat felt that it was inappropriate to continue to perfunctorily, so he had to admit that the President's eyes seemed to have a slight glint of tears.</p>
<p>The President said uneasily: "But I have to go to my wife right away, what should I do?" It turned out that the President's wife was hosting VIPs in the neighboring room, and many guests were present. The President should naturally also greet them.</p>
<p>Kohslaat came up with a plan. He advised the President to "hum" loudly before entering the neighboring room. The sound should be loud so that everyone could hear it. The effort should be sufficient so that there would be a little tear in the eyes due to "blowing the nose"! Pretend to have a cold, and everyone will not be suspicious.</p>
<p>Kohslaat stood quietly and watched the President solemnly stand up, walk into the neighboring room in big strides—pause slightly at the door, "hummed" loudly, and then went to greet the guests...</p>
<p>Sadly, President McKinley's mood was already like this at the time, but not long after this incident, he actually died at the hands of an assassin!</p>
<h3 id="e145">Hitting and Swearing <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of motive swearing originated from, or what its origins are. I don't know about other countries; as for our great Republic of China, it certainly existed in ancient times. In the Book of Documents, there are Gan Oath, Tang Oath, and Mu Oath. Regardless of the authenticity of these texts, one always feels a bit murderous and blustery when reading them now. Generally, they are always scolding people for being wrong and deserving to be killed and beaten! Those who are killed and beaten probably also have great articles that are grand and plausible, but due to traditional relationships, it is inconvenient to publish them, so Confucius simply deleted them to rectify people's hearts. Descending to later generations, this swearing trend gradually became popular among the people and turned into curses against the gods. After a group of heroes gather in a restaurant or a desolate temple to swear to the gods, there is always a great scene of killing well and hitting well that unfolds. Accordingly, the side effects of the word "oath" are: large-scale joint fighting, and small-scale secret punches!</p>
<p>According to the explanation of the word "oath," Shuowen says, "It is a restraint." The Book of Rites, Qu Li, also says, "An agreement of faith is called an oath"; the commentary says "Use words to mutually restrain each other as a basis for trust." Playing with the word "mutual," swearing is not a unilateral action. In other words, both parties must be willing to mutually restrain each other in order to obtain "trust," and only then is the oath effective. Like the oaths currently in circulation, the oath is only a one-sided, wishful thinking imposition, forcing people to obey; the object of the oath knows that not swearing is not enough to satisfy selfish desires, so they have no choice but to be perfunctory and swear randomly, making this kind of ceremonial phrase of being willing to receive the most severe punishment become children's "lip service," who is willing to follow it reverently!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the word "can" (餐) is composed of "zhe" (折) and "yan" (言). According to the Six Scripts Explanation, the intention of creating this word is "to use words to reduce one's crime." I don't quite understand how to reduce it. The word "zhe" is composed of "hand" and "jin" (斤). "Jin" is an axe, a tool for killing or hitting people. With a hand holding an axe, standing high above "yan," it can be proved that oaths are intended to use violence to overthrow empty words; otherwise, why put "yan" under "zhe"!</p>
<p>On the opening day of this National Games, there was an item in the program in which athletes took an oath. Under the watchful eyes of the public, the ceremony was quite grand. However, what followed was that the newspapers reported daily that unfortunate events such as athletes beating referees were publicly staged under the watchful eyes of the public. Didn't they all take oaths? No, they did. But why are there so many fighting incidents? After thinking about it again and again, I can only blame the word "oath" for being too strange!</p>

<p>Tilting is difficult and half-painted sky, Lan and Hu drink with certainty; Poetic heart is like two springs in a good time, waiting to nurture the grass and trees in the mountains.</p>
<p>Lofty and does not sink or float with the vulgar, passing by is gorgeous and allows to leave or stay; The human world has a clear distinction between the turbid and the pure, and the Kangquan River flows forever.</p>
<p>Occasional Feeling</p>
<p>Zhuzhou Huawu is a battlefield, the will of heaven and the hearts of the people are both shocked; Away from the chaos, a hundred poems express my feelings, and I remember the years of peace most clearly.</p>
<p>The spring breeze deliberately floats in the void, the floating world retains the floating glory; The bright peach blossoms have all passed before my eyes, and are even more lightly entrusted to the east flow.</p>

<p>Dong Kang, an 82-year-old former Jinshi from Changzhou, was arrested after the victory because he had held a puppet position. He was then released on bail for medical treatment due to old age and illness. He passed away on the 2nd of this month. Although the case has not been concluded, it will not be pursued, because this old man's experience is considered "understandable." The authorities have deeply understood this, so he was able to escape the cage early and sleep peacefully under the window. The reason why it is understandable is that he is truly old and truly poor. He has been living alone in the old capital for many years and has long been far away from the officialdom, which is different from the situation of the Wangs and other pseudo-officials who have always been active.</p>
<p>Dong's style name is Shoujing, from Wujin, Changzhou Prefecture. He was a Juren in the Wuzi year of the 14th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. In the following year, Yichou, he joined the meeting list and was appreciated by the directors Li Hongzao and Pan Zuyin. They originally planned to list him at the top, but because of a small flaw, he was placed at 47th place. However, his article was still selected and engraved in ink to show his excellence. He was only twenty-three years old, a young age to have passed the imperial examinations. According to the old custom, this year's Fenli Ganza is Wuzi, which is exactly sixty years from his Xiangju, and he could have "re-banqueted the deer's cry." After becoming a Jinshi in Yichou, he was assigned to the Ministry of Justice as a chief. During the Guangyi period, he went from the "Old Ministry of Justice" to the Dali Yuan (the old Dali Temple was changed to a new system and a new name). After the founding of the Republic of China, he rotated between the Minister of Justice and the President of the Dali Yuan and became a senior figure in the legal world. Although he had many years of official experience, the legal world was more clear and cold compared to other departments. Dong had a very deep scholar's temperament. He devoted himself to the study of inscriptions and books, was keen on addiction, and was good at appraisal. He had the name of "Old Antique" and was admired by the old experts in Liulichang. Even the Japanese who prided themselves on archaeological Sinology respected him as a god. Dong once traveled to Japan and competed with antiques, earning a surplus to make up for his expenses. He lived in the West Brick Hutong next to Fayuan Temple in the south of the city. The residence was temple property, and he rented it for thirty years, living with monks and gradually becoming poor. When Song Zheyuan was the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, someone spoke for him, and he began to be assisted with 1,000 yuan to lubricate his dry rut. After the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese puppet regime organized a government, with so-called supreme three committees: "Administration," "Political Affairs," and "Judiciary." In fact, only "Administration" still had "puppet affairs" to do. "Political Affairs" was said to mean "legislation," but there was nothing to do, and it soon disappeared into thin air. It started as neither a donkey nor a horse, and then became a fox, which was very ridiculous. The "Judiciary" Committee was also large but useless, as if it existed or didn't exist. Old Dong was put on stage as a façade because of his seniority in the legal world, and he was paid a salary every month, although it was not small, but it was of the "dry repair" type.</p>
<p>Many old people were caught up in the whirlpool in this chaos. The Wangs were all seventy years old, while the Dongs were all eighty. In ancient times, "longevity" and "fortune" were often mentioned together. Those with high longevity were called "human Rui" (瑞, auspicious omen). However, the French Petain is ninety-two years old this year (the Western calendar must be fully calculated, which is equivalent to ninety-three years old according to the Chinese way of counting years), and the sentence of "life imprisonment" is equivalent to wishing him "eternal life." Recently, I heard that he could not stand the iron windows of the desolate fortress and applied for a retrial. Leaving aside the law and discussing life, it is also a very interesting thing.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Idle Talk about Heroes <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Chu</p>
<p>The hero in the Chinese consciousness is mostly a "superman." This "superman" does not refer to the hero's talent and virtue, but to his right to enjoy. A certain behavior is not allowed for ordinary people, but the Chinese hero must try it, and after the hero tries it, the management or enforcement personnel not only have no choice but to apologize to him. Who dares to break ground on Mount Tai and interfere with the hero's actions? Therefore, the hero is the one who smokes heavily in the theater; the hero is the one who can move freely while others queue up to buy tickets for the car. The Chinese concept of a hero is only this.</p>
<p>Heroes are naturally great. But in China, all the friends and things of a hero are great. Heroes can naturally enjoy privileges, and heroes' friends can do the same. At least, in an awkward situation, reporting the hero's name will solve all problems. We often see many people who like to say: "So-and-so treats me like this, so-and-so is someone to me," and so on. These so-called so-and-sos are the names of heroes, and those people hang them on their lips every day, or it is one way to increase their own value.</p>
