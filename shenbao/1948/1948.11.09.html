<h3>蔣總裁分析軍政情形　經濟困難正謀補救　收兌金銀外幣「取之於民用之於民」　勉勵國人團結長期奮門</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕國民黨中央黨部八日上午九時舉行擴大總理紀念週，到中央各部會負責同志及本黨立監委員一千餘人，蔣總裁親臨主持，對目前軍事，政治與經濟情形，曾作詳盡之分折。軍事方在，總裁認爲東北重要據點長春·瀋陽與錦州之失陷，誠然是革命過程所遭遇之嚴重的挫折，但前綫指揮官廖耀湘·李濤等慷慨成仁，充分表現了革侖軍人的精神。經濟方面，幣制改革以後，由於共匪的蓄意破壞與軍事的影響，發生種種困難，政府已在設法補救，對於一般愛國人民，在改革幣制的時候，擁護國策，將他們血汗換來的金銀和外幣，繳兌金圓券，現在因物價動盪，而遭受損失，這是政府十分遺憾的事，但政府必一本「取之於民用之於民」的原則，採取實際的措置，來安慰一般愛護國家，遵守法令的人民。總裁最後明白指出：「目前的戰爭，實際是抗戰的延長，全國和平的破壞，係由於共匪的叛亂，政府只有消滅共匪叛亂，才可以求得和平，目前一切和平謠言，均係共匪的宣傳攻勢，政府方針早定出，以全力求得最後勝利，須知戡亂戰爭，乃是一個民族主義的戰爭，是長期的戰爭，我們必須以抗戰時期的決心和精神，再作入年長期奮鬥的準備，團結一致，集中力量，犧牲奮鬥，則時局一定可以轉危爲安，轉敗爲勝，獲得最後的勝利」。</p>
<p>訓詞原文</p>
<p>蔣總裁訓詞原文如次：最近東北重要據點錦州，長春，潘陽相繼淪陷，加以共匪到處造謠，全國人民心理爲之動盪不安這是必然的現象，大家還記得當九一八事變發生，東北三省淪陷，那時不僅全國人心大駭，郎全世界各國亦莫不爲之震驚。現在東北軍事遭此嚴重挫失，當然要使全國同胞發生九一八當時同樣的心理，不過，我們從整個革命的立塲來說，一時的頓挫，於整個革侖的成敗，並無重大的關係。民國三十四年東北行轅去到長春準備接收東北主權，遭遇到種種的阻碍，後來奉侖撤回到山海關，當時一般負責同志曾說，我們東北淪陷了十四年，而主權仍然不能由我們接收，但我們決心完成抗戰的目的，卽使東北再淪陷十四年，我們亦必誓死奮鬥，來收回整個東北。這一次東北戰役，是我們革命歷史上最大的敎訓，也是我們革命過程中最大的挫折和最壯烈的犧牲，我們必須永誌不忘，我們前綫指揮官廖司令官耀湘以下各級官員，堅決抱定與陣地共存亡的決心，曾經向我報告，如不能收復錦州，決不再回瀋陽。後來在匪軍合力包圍之下，猛烈衝擊，廖司令官及李軍長濤等終於全軍殉職，壯烈成仁，這實在充分表現了我們革侖軍人的精神，對得起國家民族，也就證明了東北戰役在整個剿匪軍事中的重要性，爲我們國民革侖留下一個永不磨滅的紀念。</p>
<p>其次，在經濟方面，政府改革幣制和管制經濟的政策，由於共匪匪蓄意破壞和軍事失利的影響，在執行上遭受種種的困難，現在政府己在設法補救，但是大家都知道，天下沒有萬全的方案，而經濟改革方案所牽涉的範圍，尤爲複雜，絕對不能有百利而無一弊。只要我們一方面發現流弊加以改正，一方面加强對匪的經濟作戰，使匪諜不能在我們都市和鄉村裏面製造黑市搶購物資，則我相信改革幣制仍能收安定經濟的功效。政府所特別表示遺憾的，就是幣制改革實行之後，一般愛國的人民，爲了擁護國衆，將他們血汗換來的金銀和外幣，繳兌金圓券，現在因爲物價波動，因而遭受財產的損失，對於這些愛國守法的同胞，政府是十分嘉慰而關念的。政府一定萬本着取之於民，用之於民的原則，採取有效的措置，給予他們以安慰。同時也希望一般同胞勿聽信謠言，勿自亂步驟，遵守政府的法令，力求經濟的安定。</p>
<h3>國事無論如何艱危　是蜚界限須確立　一切和謠只是爲匪宣傳攻勢張目</h3>
<p>自東北軍事失利以來，共匪謠言攻勢的猛烈，已經達於極點，不但一般民衆受了謠言的煽惑，感到恐慌，就是知識分子也不能認淸國家眞正的利害，而在心理上發生動搖，前幾天南京竟有少數知識分子公然發表文字，提出和平的主張，這實在是自己喪失了民族精神，完全是投降主義者，總理臨終的時候曾經說過，你們絕對不能與敵人妥協，這句話是對汪精衛說的，在精衛後來不但與共匪妥協，而且與日本妥協，因此，不僅他個人身敗名裂，而且使整個革命事業遭受很大的損失。今天這些人抹殺了國家的利益，喪失了國民的立塲，響應共匪的謠言攻勢，而主張向共匪投降，這不但是他們自己甘作共匪的奴隸，而且要貽害於我們整個中華民族永遠作異族的奴隸牛馬。最近共匪指使一般徒衆，提出兩句口號，一是「求溫飽」，一是「求和平」，這完全是抄襲蘇聯內戰時代「土地麵包休戰」的三個口號，他們想要以此來迷惑全國的同胞，瓦解剿匪的精神力量，實際上全國同胞無不知道中國的今天的環境與蘇聯當時的國情完全不同，本黨自總理領導革命以來，以實現三民主義爲惟一的目標，亦卽是爲求我們國家的獨立統一與全國人民的生存自由，在抗戰勝利之後，政府爲保持國內和平，從事國家建設，不惜委曲求全，容忍遷就，與共匪再三談判，並且迭次頒布了停止衝突的命令，事實俱在，衆所共知，而共匪終於悍然不顧，全面叛變，今天究竟是誰在製造戰爭，誰使人民不能飽溫，全國人民，大家應該看得很淸楚，這類知識份子如果他不是甘心作共匪的工其，那他們就應該到匪區向毛澤東求和平，求溫飽，事實上匪首毛澤東正在力闢中間路綫，公開主張世界革命，對於這種存心毀滅國家民族的賣國叛徒，還有什麼和平可言。國軍戡亂剿匪方針，早己確定，必以全力貫澈到底，目前一切和謠，只是爲共匪宣傳攻勢張目，絕不影響我們政府和軍民同胞爲國除害的決心，國軍無諭如何艱危，而是非邪正的界限必須確立，我們黨政軍各方面負責同志和一般社會大家，都負有這個責任。</p>
<h3>同胞應提高警覺</h3>
<p>匪寬大政策係欺騙陰謀</p>
<p>再次，對共匪所謂寬大政策的欺騙陰謀，我們同胞亦須提高警覺，近來共匪再三宣傳對於佔領區不再實行土地改革，不再鬥爭淸算，並且聲稱要保護私人財產，自從濟南失陷以後，他這種僞裝寬大的欺騙宣傳，更見積極，但是我們必須告訴全國同胞，共匪所說的不鬥爭，不淸算，祗是對於初佔領的地區一種麻醉的手段，一等到他們佔領的時間稍久，軍事的暴力已經可以控制整個社曾，他就一定要暴露他猙獰的面目，實行其一的殘殺政策，來排除異已，例職濟南沒有失陷以前，共匪對於濰縣的人民是採取所謂寬大政策的，鄭州沒有撤退以前，他對洛陽人民也採取同樣的手段，而濟南失陷，鄭州撒退以後，從濰縣，洛陽兩地逃出來的民衆說，他們已經與黃河北岸的同胞遭受了同樣慘酷的命運，所有糧食，物資，都爲共匪搜括一空，人民的生侖自由任意受其宰割，這種事實，大家可以去問一問由匪區逃出的民衆，我們同胞如果再不警覺，再不團結一致，在政府領導之下，爲國家基礎和爲個人生存而奮鬥，則一旦爲共匪所控制，就永無翻身之日了。</p>
<h3>中政會檢討時局　認當前目標應會力支持軍事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕國民黨中央政治委會八日晨於中央紀念週後舉行臨時會議，蔣總裁親自主持，李宗仁，張治中等均參加，會中分由何應欽，王世杰報告軍事，外交。軍事報告略就柬北戰事及徐，蚌綫部署予以說明，何氏對徐·蚌綫之部署，認爲有充份準備，匪如來犯，決不足以動搖。外交報告爲出席聯大之經過及外交政策等，旋由各委員發言，就當前時局予以檢討，最後獲得結論，認爲當前目標應全力支持軍事，求得軍事上之勝利，外交政策部份，則俟　作研究，旋散會。本日會中未討論其他提案。</p>
<h3>艱險困難時局　定可轉危爲安　對東北決以全力收回</h3>
<p>最後，大家必須認識，目前的戰事，實際上就是抗戰的延長，乃是一個長期性的民族戰爭，我在民國卅五年二月，曾經對上海同胞說過：「我們抗戰是勝利了，但是我們還要經過入年長期艱苦的奮鬥，纔能眞正求得我們國家的獨立和民族的自田，「我們全國過去八年的抗戰和三年的剿匪，就是爲了收復東北，保障我們國家的生侖綫，東北縱令暫時淪陷，我們終要用我們全國的力量去收回的。我今天要告訴大家一句話，這次東北軍事雖然失敗，但在關內政治，經濟，軍事各方面的基礎，絲毫沒有動搖，與共匪實力比較，仍然居於優勢。現在的問題，就是看我們內部能不能堅定信心，團結一致，能不能振作精神，集中力量，如果再像今天一樣放任匪諜散播毒素宣傳，使精神渙散，心理動搖，則共匪本來沒有力量，仍舊可以用種種方法來威脅我們。反之，只要我們能團結精神，集中力量。來對付共匪，則時局無論如何危險艱難，我們仍舊可以轉危爲安，轉敗爲勝。大家應該回憶民國十三四年間，共匪破壞國民革命的反動力量何等猖獗，而我們信心不搖，終於將他制服，由這二十餘年來革命的歷史來看，可以相信我這句話絕對的正確。在今天這個時局動亂的時候，惟一電要的條件，就是先求安定，唯有安定沉着，纔能考慮出新的出路，希望中央各部門負責同志堅忍鎭定，在軍事第一的原則之下，擁護整個決策，共同一致認眞執行，這樣，不但大局可以挽回，而且共匪必可早日消滅，現在共匪是一切爲了軍事，他們的黨政軍都是實行戰時體制，而我們的　一切則還是平時的狀態，鬆弛繁複，各不相謀，如何加張戰時意識與實行戰時體制，如何集中精力，節省時間，求得工作的配合，步驟的齊一，尤爲各位同志所應切實考慮的問題，只要這個問題可以解決，則我們就一定可以打破難關，挽救時局，我個人平生做事的態度，一件事不開始則已，一開始就一定要求其成功，任何聯現，不輕易担任，一經担任，就決定負現到底，尤其我卅餘年來對任何戰役，在發動以前，無不鄭重決定，一經發動，則無論經過任何挫折，困難和失敗，必定奮鬥到底，以貫澈到底。今後的剿匪戰爭，也和抗日戰爭一樣，雖然要經歷無數的艱苦，但最後一定能達到目的。各位可以相信，我一定有轉危爲安的把握，務必堅定共信，確立自信，並且確信三民主義和民族精神靡堅勿摧的力量，一定可以猁最一後的勝利。（完）</p>

<h3>如何防止經濟的續惡化</h3>
<p>自限價開放後，物價就如脫繮野馬，狂奔狂跳，一發而不可收抬·這幾天來，愈演愈烈，使上海市民人人感受生活的威脅，惶惶然不可終日。限價開放迄今，雖祗有短短的七八天，但食米，食油，麵粉，煤炭以及其他日用品，無一不身價十倍，而且朝晚市價不同，其漲勢的驚人，實使升斗小民不寒而慄</p>
<p>推究上海市塲所以致此之因，大要不外下列數端：（一）爲市價狂跳，一日數漲；（二）棉布，香烟等貨物，似有人有計劃地搶購，致商家無從應付，迫得有一部份暫行停業；（三）爲拆息太高，正當工商業無法進展；（四）有數種貨物，大量外流，本埠存底日形枯竭；（五）米，油等日用必需品，不但步步飛漲，而且供不應求。其實綜合起來，一爲貨價問題；二爲貨源問題；三爲金融問題。所以要謀有效地予以解決，不能不對症發藥，從這幾個問題上速籌對策。</p>
<p>按照補充辦法的規定，今後的貨價，一部份應速核本定價，其餘則任令自由買賣，而所謂核本定價，一部份歸中央主管，一部份則由地方政府辦理。在長期的硬性限價以後，不論是核本定價貨物，抑或自由買賣貨物，以事實上種種原因，必須作相當幅度的調整，這雖是勢所必至的結果。但我們以爲：核本定價的貨物，如果能迅速擬定，一一公吿施行，問時對於核定的貨價，能互相配合，有效地予以監督執行，則一切貨價的新水準，不難迅速地樹立起來。現在市塲混亂，已呈焦頭爛額的狀態，除了嚴禁强購取締囤積，並維持正常的秩序，挽回這種混亂的狂瀾外，似仍應循以上這種途徑去迅圖補救，以期貨價的穩定。否則自由買賣的貨物，以漫無約束之故，固將如脫繮之馬，狼奔豕　，而核本定價的貨物，亦皆將以無所適從爲藉口，而漫天討論，爭取暴利，或公然停業，坐享囤積的利益。照這樣下去，市塲混亂的情形，究將演變到何種局面，實在不堪設想。</p>
<p>貨源問題，包括兩個重要因素，卽一爲增加生產，一爲疎導來源，而在目前的緊急情形之下，自以後者更爲切要。具體辦法，除便利運輸，補助資金及　　地廢除阻物出境的禁令以外，莫急於城鄉貨物之交流。因爲在長期限價，與徵購徵收之後，農民創鉅痛深，多不願將各種農產物源源上市，或備藏家中，　作觀望；或延不收割，　免婪實；或亦效法都市上流行的時髦口號，所請以物易物。實行餘　餘布的交換政策。結果則城鎭空盧，欲囤不得，自更無從供給大都市之需要了。現在米糧巳許自由洗通，而且各地相互間的擅禁出境，亦已切實取締，但大都市與內地各城餌，還是普遍地　着糧荒，就是這個主要問題，還沒有設法解決之故。</p>
<p>至於銀根緊急，其原因太多，這裏也不必再予分析。不過游資充斥這個根本問題，如果沒有方法解決，則以洗轉方向的變更，與國積情形的盛　，其間兎起　落，忽張忽弛，自無從加以有效的管制。所以治本之方，仍在於調節發行，收縮通貨，使金融市塲趨於安定。其有時間性的關係，商家頭寸過於短絀，致妨礙其正當的業務時，則國家銀行職實所在，究應如何酌盈濟虛，開放貸款，調節市息，應不是沒有辦法。</p>
<p>總之，自經管政策修正以後，各方面所發生的不良影響，過於深刻，已使一般民衆，重入於迷惘的狀况。這種情形，如果任其自然，不赶速予以補救，恐將自經濟問題而臺及到社會問題乃至治安問題，這實在是不容忽視的事件了！盼望一切有關係的負實當局迅速採取必要的行動，以免經濟局勢日趨於惡化！</p>

<h3>四川糖城－資中</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔成都三日航訊〕四川是我國最大產糖區，沱涪洗域四十六縣，產糖面積逾八百萬恩，太報上月三日台北電，台糖公司爲發展川粵糖業，決與資委會在川資中銀山鎭，合辦四川糖廠，爲了這令人興奮的發展川糖事業消息，記者特乘秋高氣爽之際，來此沱江流域中心，四川產糖第二大城——資中，用大半天時光，匆匆走馬觀花似的看看川糖近來生產情况。</p>
<p>糖城之若　天災人禍</p>
<p>資中東跙成都三百餘里，是四川仅亞於內江的第二產糖區，一般淡川糖，多舉內江爲代表，其實論前途發展，資中備具的條件遠多於內江。踏進這三面濱江的美麗糖城，處處蔗林葱籠，烟突聳峙，秋陽暮靄，氣象不凡。全縣境大小糖房約八百餘座，產糖區域包括銀山，球溪，太平，龍山十餘鄉鎭，有二百多家蔗糖生產合作社，統計去年度共產糖淸五千七百餘萬市斤，據調查，資中縱橫百餘里，三四十萬人口，直接間接生存依賴於糖業約十分之七八。記者到資中，恰值一年一度的收穫季節，但由於今夏水災，沱江泛濫，蔗產飽受災害，再加以秋間幣潮，資中遭蓉渝物價的激盪，糖房漏棚代表的資方，與蔗農代表的勞方，普遍不景氣，人人愁眉苦顏，意緒簫索頹喪，這說明資中今年糖業，正陷入空前萎縮。</p>
<p>生產萎縮　兩種原因</p>
<p>中糖業當資前情况，代表川糖普遍的不景氣，而不景氣的根本原因，據記者綜合糖房，漏棚與蔗農三階層人士的意見，第一是物價激漲，經濟動盪，表現在使生產成本，糖價，與物價三者脫節。例如今年一月份，糖價一萬市斤爲八千萬元（法幣），十月份漲達五千金圓（合法幣一百五十億）但糧價波動遠逾於此，蔗農種蔗收益遠不及雜糧獲利爲大，於是今年遂有若干蔗農改種紅苕。其次是貸款不易如今年資中蔗貸，總數僅四百五十億，每畝平攤一百五十萬（卽五角金圓），同時最近川省行荘因增資問題停止糖貸，物價漲，蔗價高，蔗農旣感無法維持生活而改業，漏棚與糖房也因無法張羅資金而减產，糖業於是自然陷於不景氣。第二是勞資階層未允協調，糖業生產三階層，蔗農，漏棚與糖房，過去爲預賣秋季甘蔗的「賣靑山」制度，現在改採「評價政策」，都因雙方科害牴觸，感情未允融洽，如去年震動全川的「資中糖潮」，蔗農搗毀縣府，卽是一例，由於這三方面的步調參差，未能協力共謀進步，使糖業生產限制不少</p>
<p>落伍方式　有待改進</p>
<p>作爲川糖進步的歸大障碍，尙有落伍的生產方式，走遍資中，難見一所新式糖廠，製糖過程純粹舊式，程序是：第一步先由糖房壓蔗成水，熬製糖淸，第二步再由漏棚加工提煉，製成精糖，工具是石磨，鐵鍋，瓦鉢，泥漿與獸力，憑舊式「熬糖師」的經驗，從壓蔗到成糖，費時在一月以上，成本與時間兩不經濟，在這極端舊式方法所生產的川糖，要與機械化的糖產競爭，眞是戞乎其難。</p>
<p>再其次是天候與地土限制，甘庶是熱帶產物，環顧世界產糖區，如古巴·印度·爪哇與我國台灣，廣東等地，緯度皆在二十五度以下，平均溫度則在二十度以上，四川緯度在廿六度以上，平均溫度在十七度以下，因氣候較冷與種植期較短，加以資中蔗土三分之二以上是山土（山土優於壩土），地處邱陵區域，甘蔗不易集中·受這兩種限制，資中蔗晨多半利用植苗法，兩年一輪種，天然發展，受障不淺。</p>
<p>談川糖改進，資中糖業人士對台糖公司來資設廠，寄託無限期望。一般認爲改進川糖的方面，第一是改良生產方式。第二是移植優良蔗種，改良栽培方法。</p>
<p>川糖有近三百年的悠久歷史，過去產量是全國第一，銷遍長江中上游與西甫西北以及康藏一帶，抗戰戡亂對於後方民食與國家稅源，更有光榮貢獻，川糖應該有前途，台糖公司在資中設廠，無異給川糖發展帶來光明遠景。</p>

<h3>美正考慮各項外交問題　對中國將採新決策　杜魯門飛抵小白宮度假期</h3>
<p>〔聯台肚華盛頓七日電〕美國顯已準備採取各項步驟，參加北大西洋軍事聯盟，此乃週末白宮一連串外交政策討論之結果。杜魯門返京小留期中，曾與國務次長羅維特會晤三次·聞羅氏向總統報吿各項重大外交政策問題，中國局勢亦在其內。總統似面許羅維特繼續談判，以便完成北大西洋聯防計劃。美國外交政策方面之高級人員雖有調動之說，但一般預料杜魯門似將保留現有人負，至少等待下屆國會通過其外交政策方案之後。該方案內客可能爲：（一）要求參議院批准北大西洋軍事聯盟，（二）對付中國危局之新措施；（三）撥付援歐計劃第二年度經費，同時規定新軍事租借援助辦法。國務部長馬歇爾之友人則稱，馬氏辭意堅決自無問題，但總統倘堅請其暫時留任若干時期，馬氏亦必應允無疑。同時，國防部長福萊斯特與羅維時倘由杜魯門挽留一二月，亦可應允。關於推進北大西洋盟約之次期行動，魷國務部方面而論，大約將於日內與共和黨參議院外交委員會主席范登堡與民主黨參議員康納利商議，康氏在下屆國會中可望出任該委員會主席。同時，西歐五國正在草擬盟約，以便於一星期或十日內向美國提出，作爲實　談判基礎。</p>

<h3>拋售物資收縮通貨　當局今開緊爭會議　原則決定先拋部分紗糖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三日來本市物價波動之程度，堪稱空前，其原因所在，除蘇魯戰局影響人心外，另一重要因素爲華北游資之大量南來。游資每日抵滬數量，最高超過一億金圓，最低亦在五千萬以上，而此批游資之唯一出路，卽爲搶購物資。據悉，本市各有關當局爲應付起見，擬重採拋售物資收縮通貨之方法，惟在技術上將作若干修正。吳局長開先昨日上午曾赴央行訪經檢會主任秘書俞季慮及物資調節會主委李立俠，對此作初步洽商，原則上決定先在央行提撥一部份棉紗及食糖，卽日起實行拋售。至於拋售物資之來源及執行之詳細辦法，定於今日物資調節會議中商定。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕上海區經濟督導員辦公處，爲調節滬市物資，審核各項議價，以期穩定物價起見，定於今（九）日上午九時半，在國行督導員辦公處，舉行臨時緊急會議，將由俞督導員鴻鈞親自主持，吳市長，潘議長，劉副總裁，吳社會局，長等，均將被邀出席，對今後滬市之金融經濟物價等，將有重要決定。</p>

<h3>社會局長主張麵粉日夜配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨談：當局對目前瘋狂之物價，已會商決定自收縮通貨及儘量供應食糧着手。台糖公司及中紡公司卽日起大量拋售糖與紗，物資供應局所有存貨亦儘量應市。食糧問題，十月份戶口米供應不繼，故暫先以麵粉代替，倉庫存粉頗多，供應可無虞，米商向產區採辦之食米，亦正陸續運滬。現因人心恐慌，配售店前排隊擁擠不堪，渠將建議於每一區集中數處日夜配售，以减少擁擠情形。吳局長稱：政府旣發給配售證，一定負責配給，卽使逾期，亦可領取。故盼家有存糧者勿爭先擠軋，俾讓無隔宿糧之市民先領。</p>

<h3>疏導米來源獲具體辦法</h3>
<p>派警保護米店碼頭</p>
<p>爲解除本市自色恐慌，吳市長昨晨召集警局局長俞叔平，民食調配處處長陸桂祥，米業代表萬墨林，社會局糧食科長吉明齊等十餘人，商討疏導米源供應市塲辦法，已獲具體結果，市長並飭警局派警保護各米店及碼頭，如南市豐記碼頭，四川路橋蘇州河兩邊，武進路橋恒豐路橋一帶大通路阜新碼頭，七廠門口，老閘橋輪埠碼頭，石灰港等處，並責由米業公會每區商定若干米號集中供應。僉信以後戶口米之配售及普通食米供應秩序，當可好轉。</p>

<h3>豬肉蔬菜不斷激漲　市長召兩業·令監視市塲</h3>

<h3>出口貿易全部停頓　得款難採購物資商人盼恢復貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕幣制改革七十天之後，出口業已完全陷於停頓狀態。據出口業人士之意見，認爲挽救之道，除調整匯率，恢復結匯證明書制度外，尙須恢復出口押匯及打包貸款，始克有濟。原因爲出口物資價格上漲之速度太快，出口商候出售結匯證所得之價款，在產地採購物資，時間上已嫌不足，故須恢復各項出口貸款，以資補救。另一閑難有待克服者，卽產區農民因知識關係，重物輕幣，幣制改革以來，採購商人常將法幣易成金銀，作爲支付工具，今日金銀已收歸國有，故此項方法已不適用，但農民之觀念不變，將來究如何解決，亦有待籌劃。又目前出口物資市塲，幾吿全部停頓，上海方面有行無市，價格常在低盤上落·以桐油之市價而言，上週末僅有二百六十元，買賣無法進行。漢口重慶上週末之桐油市價，其上漲程度均遠在其他物資之下。另一大宗出口貨物猪鬃，因週末蘇北戰局轉緊，來源斷絕，貨主皆執貨不放，交易陷於停頓狀態。茶葉在上週末略有做開，但目前交易又陷於停頓·綜言之，依出口業之目前情勢觀察，除非政府在外匯率及其他方面採取有力行動，則短期內難望重振。</p>
<h3>市執行記者報告　食米來源無虞間斷　洋米八萬噸即可運浪　電請速撥台米應急需　對聚衆搶米者決予嚴懲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長以近日本市米市極端混亂，且昨日各處曾發生搶米情事，特於昨日下午六時，在市府辦公處接見各報社記者，報吿食米來源，無慮間斷，本市己訂購洋米八萬噸，其中美援米六萬噸，中央信託局食米二萬噸，均已分別別洽購就緒，一俟運輸問題解決，卽可源源來滬供應。又爲暫時救急計，吳市長昨曾與翁院長通長途電話，請儘速與台灣省主席魏道明商洽，於最短期間，設法趕運食米一萬噸來滬，適逢魏主席現在京有要公，翁院長當准予設法。</p>
<p>市府當局對近日本市數處米號發現聚衆搶米越規行動，極爲重視，吳市長對此亦極表震怒，因宣司令已去京，渠昨曾與警備司令部包參謀接洽，爲全市市民自身安危設想，應一致起而制栽，昨經會商決議，當局爲維持地方治安及社會秩序，對搶米當決嚴予懲處，並將儘力保護米商，俾食米能源源來滬。</p>
<p>又吳市長曾於昨日下午三時，赴美國經濟合作總署中國分署訪晤賴樸翰，商討食米供應問題，賴氏表示美方決盡力援助，現當局正商討採取以貨易米辦法，此外並商得緊急補救各項方案，惟在未獲美方同意時，暫不宣佈·</p>
<p>吳市長最後指出食米恐慌原因，係由於中央之限價政策所致，因九月底時，渠確知本市有存米三十萬祖，由於限價，五十天內未有新米來滬，致造成食米恐慌，現當局已予設法，望市民對此過渡時期應各忍耐云。</p>
<h3>賴樸翰鄭重聲明　美援食糧恢復配售　目擊糧荒嚴重·竭力加速運華</h3>
<p>〔經合署八日上海訊〕美國經濟合作總署中國分署署長賴僕翰今日發表書面談話如次：</p>
<p>余首先須向中國各大城市堅忍的人民說明者，卽美援食糧卽可望恢復各大城市十二月份之食糧配售。</p>
<p>「目覩始能置信」，些言洵屬不虛，當余於上週自美返華，目擊此間人民尋求食糧之困苦，殊爲驚駭。余在華盛頓時，雖曾接分署報吿，獲悉此間因經濟政策失當及計劃欠週引起糧荒之情形，初固未能料及各階級人民所受之困苦，有如是之嚴重也。</p>
<p>大宗食糧正在起運</p>
<p>美國方面担任供給之食糧，已經全部執行完妥·當初之計，爲美援食糧將於明年一月再度開始，分發各市酣售，而本年秋季之儒要，則在中國國內採購米麥應付，但當余在華盛頓收到此項採辦瀕於失敗之消息時，余卽設法將經合分署已經訂購之美援食糧從速運華。</p>
<p>大批小麥及麵粉，正在遝華途中，遠在華盛頓州之他可馬及墨西哥灣之各海口，亦有大量食糧，正在起運，此外尙有大批食米可於本月底前由暹羅起運至上海，南京及廣州，吾人現正盡力設法，加速運輸。</p>
<p>羣策羣力渡過難關</p>
<p>吾人深信自十二月份起，數閱月內吾人計劃以美援食糧，充作配售所需數量之大半，目前並擬協助中國政府就地採辦食糧，以便减輕本月份各市人民所經歷之困難，</p>
<p>在此非常時期，人人應具各盡本職，服務大衆之精神，以期羣策羣力，渡過難關·美國經濟合作署準備在其可能範圍內竭盡全力以赴·</p>
<p>吾人本年及來年之一切工作，正在依照預定計劃進行中，棉花及石油計劃，業將完成，肥料正在採購中，由美援棉花製成之棉紗及棉織品，將以之換取食糧，目前遭遇之困難，僅表示美經合署以後之工作，應較平時加倍努力。</p>
<p>本人來自一酷愛和平與獨立並崇尙生產自力精神之國家，吾人希望中國人民均能享受同樣的幸福，此乃吾人來華工作之目的也。</p>

<h3>贛東與贛南創立示範區</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌三日訊〕贛南的贛縣與贛東的宜豐，經省政府決定爲推行扶植自耕農地區，主持此一新政的地政局，巳將計劃與經費預算等草擬完竣，逐一付諸實施。預計三年的今日，可能達成國父遺教中「耕者有其田」的目標。</p>
<p>贛縣轄區</p>
<p>遼闊，全縣劃分爲四十三個鄉鎭，計有農地九十三萬二千零四十三畝，蔣經國主持贛南政治時，巳經奠下一座「建設新贛南」的基業，所以在民國卅二年曾經擇定贛縣所屬吉埠，白雲兩處，試辦此一新政。吉埠示範區業務，早已完成，計創設自耕農七二〇戶，頗著成效，惟白雲則以地主訴願，工作陷於停頓，未克在預定計劃之下推進此項工作。</p>
<p>目下擬在贛縣征收土地三十萬畝，扶植自耕農一萬五千戶，分五期辦理，在示範區以外地區，普遍辦理一種扶植自耕農業，協助農民購地自耕。</p>
<p>贛縣扶植目耕農示範區</p>
<p>分期辦理</p>
<p>的鄉鎭及時間訂定如下：（一）第一期，卅七年十一月開辦者，贛州鎭，白雲，水東，水西，永安，章江，黃全，儲埠，定卅九年十月完成。（二）第二期，卅八年二月開辦者，計：沙石，隅南，禮　，七鯉，化江。和樂，廉東，康西，定四十年一月完成。（三）第三期，卅八年五月開辦者，計：石光，南塘，淸政，社富，江口，建節，玉鷺，龍口，傑村，定四十年四月完成。（四）第四期，卅八年八月開辦者，計：松里，桂源，當堯，大興，新村，湖田，攸鎭，大湖，長丹，定四十年七月完成。（五）第五期，卅八年十一月開辦者，計：王富，新興，長濱，韓坊，小岔，夏寒，長洛，大埠，王母，定四十年十月完成。</p>
<p>宜豐農地</p>
<p>業經測量完竣約計一百四十萬坵，六十二萬三一千七百八十一市畝，該縣地勢，因岡陵起伏，地區遼闊，全縣實施區段征收，直接創設自耕農，與贛縣同樣的有困難，且因業務繁重，欲於最短期間內，同時舉辦，人力物力亦不可能，該縣爲使今後業務得以順利進展，決分三期辦理，分鄉選擇荒地，劃出佃土地較多地段，爲扶植自耕農示範區，實行區段征收，直接創設自耕農，預定今縣征收土地廿萬畝，扶植自耕農一萬戶，分期辦理的鄉鎭與時間，亦經規定如下：（一）第一期，卅七年十一月開辦者，計：鹽步。續良。風德。宣化，蘆溪。定卅九年十月完成。（二）第二期，卅八年五月開辦者，計：荷塘·新民·棠浦。天德·太平·定四十年四月完成。（三）第三期，卅八年十一月開辦者，計：辛會。慶凱·雙庫·黃岡·定四十年十月完成。扶植自耕農示範區，其</p>
<p>組織機構</p>
<p>如下：縣設地政科長一人，　下分地籍·地櫂·地價·地用四股，設股長四人，科員六人，辨事員四人，雇員四人，（按現在縣府的編制，已將地政科緊縮，僅設科員一人，辨事員若干人辨），理地政事宜，鄉鎭則無專責幹事）。技士·技佐各二人，業務員三人，各鄉鎭設地政幹事一人，決植自耕農示範區設辨事處，辨理全區業務，各置主任一人，股長二人，股員四人，技士，技佐谷二人，業務員六人雇員四人，贛縣劃設辨事處五處，宜豐三處。</p>
<p>工作實施</p>
<p>辦法，計分土地調查，勘定示範區，查估地價，業佃申報及地籍復查，區段征收，補償地價，重劃改良，劃分單位農塲，分配放領，輔導辨理乙種扶植自耕農等十一項。</p>
<p>關于劃分單位農塲的規定，各就重劃整理結果，或原有地形，按示範區農戶，人口，及耕地面積，劃分單位農塲，每一農戶以承領一單位農塲爲原則，其面積以十畝至卅畝爲限。分酣</p>
<p>放領耕地</p>
<p>一項，更有詳細的規定：　一：農民承領土地依照下列順序：（一）原所有權人領回自耕者（二）原來承耕之農民（三）在實驗區從事耕作滿三年之農民（四）在本縣境內從事耕作滿三年之農民上列三四兩款出征軍人家屬有優先承領權。一：農民有左列情形者，不得承領土地：（一）有不良嗜好者，（二）行爲不端者，（三）耕作能力薄弱者。三：分配農塲，應使接近耕者住地，或魷原來耕種地段分配，其面積以其純收益能維持一家生活爲起點，但每戶最多不得超過上等水田卅市畝，由示範區辦事處按照該區域內耕地總面積，土地肥瘠及各戶耕作能力，以定其分配標準。四：放領土地的地價，以征收的地價爲準，其實施重劃或改良者得酌加重劃或改良費，前項地價，由領地農民自備現金二成，其餘八成以征收士地及分配放領後，應收之地價爲担保，向中國農民銀行借貸，由領地幾民分年償還。（償還期限照農行貸款規定。）五：土地征收放領後，應註銷原有契證，發給領地人以領地證明前，並造具放領淸冊，代向登記機關登記，領取權狀，俟領地人繳淸地價後，收回領地證明書換發權狀。六：放領的土地，禁止轉租或出賣，如承領人無力耕作時，應由縣照放領原價收回，重行放領。</p>

<h3>白熊在香港　搜購汽油卡車　美商採取對策</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港八日航訊〕當上次大戰時，軸心國家經由中立的西班牙向盟國方面購進大批軍用器材和原料，此情此景，現在竟又在遠東的一個角落出現了！不過，這回採購的是蘇聯，而不是軸心國，地點不是西班牙，而是香港！</p>
<p>蘇聯秘密經由香港吸收軍用器材和原料，早在一九四七年卽已開始，那時祗側重錫砂和樹膠兩項，但自華盛頓宣佈禁止軍用器材輸往蘇聯後，蘇聯便開始在港搜購卡車和汽油。最近這兩個月來，該項活動尤爲顯著。</p>
<p>隨着這個需要的發展，北韓和香港問也就展開了定期的航運。一艘名叫「彼爾達瓦」號的蘇聯貨船，便經常往來行駛，載來香港的是一船一船的大豆，運返北韓鎭南浦的是汽油，卡車，無綫電器材，樹膠和鎢砂。這批買賣都由華人經手，幕後的主人却是西伯利亞的「白熊」。</p>
<p>據記者從可靠方面探悉：港中的美商汽油公司，現已採取步驟，阻止汽油落入蘇聯之手。聽說，除非提出滿意的證件，否則現在已不容易在港購得大批的汽油。前幾天，有一個商人忽然在市面搜購「道奇牌」卡車五十輛，那時，「波爾達瓦」號恰巧由北韓駛往香港來，敏感的人便看見了一個很好的預兆。</p>
<p>不知爲了什麼，這艘「波爾達瓦」號在駛進港口鯉魚門的當兒，竟和一艘英國藍烟囪貨輪對撞，幾乎葬身九龍灣。幸而牠還能負傷駛至淺水處下沉，船頭擱在海灘上。不過，載來的大豆兩千五百噸已損失過半，佔計約個港幣一百五十萬元之鉅。？</p>

<h3>「人言」？</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>名坤票王蕙蘅之死，據說是由於「人言可畏」，這從報上所刊載釣遺詩里，可以看出一二。因爲她的死，不禁又使人聯想到二十年前也死於「人言可畏」的阮玲玉。</p>
<p>在上海，一個（名）女人的死——尤其是自殺，是必然哄動的。這幾天，王蕙蘅的死，當然又是談者和作者的　　題材。</p>
<p>在上海，一個「名」女人如果發生了什麽事，也是必然哄動釣；如果事件之中，還夾雜了點男女的關係——卽使是僅僅的一點——其哄動的程度也更大，更是必然的。前一時期，談者和作者的材料，又何嘗不是王蕙蘅什麼什麽？</p>
<p>二十年前阮玲玉的自殺，今年的王蕙蘅的自殺，時間的距離雖幾乎是一世紀的四分之一，但這一點在中國似乎沒有兩樣，所謂「人言」，還具有可怕的殺人的力量。因而「人言」逼死了當年的阮玲玉，也逼死了今天的王意蘅；它儼然是羔羊羣中的豺狼，弱者羣中的魔鬼—</p>
<p>我以爲對於一個弱者的死·—無論是自殺或被殺——大可不必來一套似乎「儼然」的公式，如「自殺是弱者的行爲」，或什麽「……咎由自取」的說教口吻。因爲這對於「往者」旣「不可諫」，「來者」也未必「可追」，對於生者和死者不但毫無裨益，而且更近於無聊。滔滔宏論，至多祗顯出了一副假裝道學，假裝慈悲的臭嘴臉！</p>
<p>因此，我對於王蕙蘅的該死或不該死，是弱者或反面是强者這一問題，不願多所曉曉·要談的，倒是「人言可畏」的所謂「人言」。</p>
<p>「人言」，不必注釋，誰都知道是「人」的說話。但卽使單　、人」，便似乎沒有如此簡單。人是圓顱方趾的動物，但圓顱方趾只是人的具形，而不一定是眞的人。我們中國對神祗的註解是：「聰明正直」，因而我對於眞的「人」，也斗胆地下一個註解，是：「辨是非，知廉恥」。否則徒具「人」形的所謂「言」不客氣地說：簡直是人頭畜鳴！</p>
<p>但是我們的「人言」又怎樣呢？只要是女人，只要是有點名聲的女人，一旦不辛而發生點什麼事，於是所謂「人言」便立時風起雲湧：一方面是吱吱喳喳繪聲繪色的說，一方面是運用「生花之筆」，「逸事」，「韵聞」……的寫。說和寫便構成了閙哄哄的「百犬吠聲」的形態，而這一形態立刻又變成了一支毒箭，直向弱者的心窩里射。於是乎弱者便不得不死了。</p>
<p>從阮玲玉之死一直到正蕙蘅之死，我們所處的，便是這樣的社會，這樣的國家，這樣的時代。時間對於我們，有　是不會發生絲亳作用的。不信，這便是一個事實。</p>
<p>「人言」是一個進步的民族所需要的，但不是上面所說的「人言」。因爲眞的「人言」，該是眞的人的聲音。一個眞的人，他對於弱者該扶持，對於不幸者該憐憫和同情，對於徬徨者該指導，對於强暴者該打擊，對於盧僞者該指摘。這才是眞的人的行爲，眞的人的聲音。</p>
<p>而我們現在的所謂「人言」呢？只知道奉承强者，壓迫弱者，揶揄不幸者，玩弄徬徨者。把弱者不幸逼死了，便又來一個惋惜或說教的面孔。這簡單是什麽東西？</p>
<p>阮玲玉和王蕙蘅這兩個犧牲者，她們眞太老實，太天眞了。給瘋狗咬了還當牠們是人，直到臨死還執迷不悟，說什麼「人言可畏」。這眞是辱沒了「人言」「人言」云胡哉？「　嗚」而已！</p>
<h3>上海公園史話</h3>
<p>— 仲堅</p>
<p>外灘公園該地原是英國領事館前面的漲灘，由於泥沙累積在一隻沉淪的破船片上而逐漸升起。淸同治元年（一八六二年），上海運動事業基金董事會議決劃用規銀一萬兩，將該地闢爲公園。同治四年，工部局興工，從洋涇浜中挖起泥土，塡平自外白渡至北京路一帶的沙灘。同治七年六月二十日（一八六八年八月八日），公園開放。在開放前兩月（同治七年閏四月），英領文極司脫（Ｃ．．Winchester）致函上海道台，稱該地已由工部局塡好，計三十畝四分七A　三毫，作爲公共娛樂塲所，決不造屋營利，應請准予豁免錢糧；上海道應寳時准如所請。但沿浦漲灘本屬中國官有地皮，不該讓工部局自由處置的。</p>
<p>虹口公園　光緒二十二年，工部局在北四川路界外地，購地造靶子塲。光緒三十一年（一九〇五年），就該地增闢公園，由工部局園地監督蘇格蘭人麥克利（MacGregor）設計和布置。麥氏爲園藝及植物專家，虹口兆豐兩公園塲地規模，都是出於他的一手經營。麥氏在華任職二十五年，至民國十八年六月始吿老返國。</p>
<p>法國公園該地原是光緒二十六年八國聯軍入京時，法國購用駐兵的。次年，辛丑和約簽訂後，法軍撒退，此地遂空荒。光緒三十四年六月，公董局董事會始計畫闢該地爲公園。宣統元年五月（一九〇九年六月），公園落成，同年七月初開放。</p>
<p>兆豐公園該園的一部分本爲兆豐花園的舊址。宣統三年。兆　花園主人何格（E.J.Hogg）將該園出售，聖約翰大學以十四萬購得其一部分，而極司菲爾路南端一部分則由工部局承購。其後，工部局魷原址展拓，增至三百畝。民國三年三月二十日納稅外人會議決議，將該地區布置爲公共的風景園地及植物園地中心，全部計畫交由園地監督麥克利氏設計。於是兆豐公園風景之美，冠絕全埠，而園藝之佳，尤爲當時稱道。</p>
<p>上述工部局及公董局開闢的公園，雖在我國境內，却一向不許我國人民入內進憇。這是租界時期華人受歧視之一端。交涉開放，始於光緒十一年，要求開放外灘公園，但工部局置之不理·光緒十五年夏，上海道憲向英領交涉結果，工部局僅允發給執照，但每張只能適用一星期，且爲數極少。宣統二年，城自治公所再提議交涉，但直到民國十七年，納稅外人年會始通過公園開放案·從這年七月一日起，各公園實行對華人開放，同時開始售票制度，年券售價一元，門券銅元十枚。</p>
<h3>勤工自助</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>今天我在會計處領到了金圓十二元，這是我一個月來勤工自助所得的代價對着手中這幾塊錢，我產生了無窮的感想。</p>
<p>讓我先來說明勤工自助的意義，這是一種半工半讀的試驗，學校爲了幫助一般淸寒的同學，和從戰區來滬的學生，因爲他們付了一筆很大的學雜膳宿費後，對於本學期的一筆相當可觀的零用，包括買書，理髮，車資等，實在有些阮囊羞澀，應付爲難了了因此，學校當局體念這個困難，就在學費收入的項目卞，劃出一部分作爲舉辦勤工自助的經費，按各同學的擅長，分配到各部門協助工作，這樣一種課餘的「職業」，每月也可累積起三四十個小時，所得的報酬照今年爲每小時金圓三角算來，也有十元之譜了。當然，這些錢在一揮數十金的同學眼中，固然不屑一看，可是在淸寒學生方面，總不無小補的吧！</p>
<p>曾經在雜誌中看到一段大同小異的記載：這長在美國的大學裏，他們也有這種自助的工作，有一個男生被派担任打掃女生宿舍，第一天那個女付他一角錢；不料晚餐時，替他工餐餐的女侍，却正是日裏給錢的她，於是，在餐後，他把賺來的一角錢，又復放在食盤裏當了小帳，那位女同學也含笑接受了。這雖是一件巧合的事，但是由此可見國外推行這種制度，已經相當普遍。</p>
<p>不過，我覺得在國內初行起來，總好像有些困難，那就是怕難爲情的心理，實在因爲環境太奢華了，很多同學會譏笑它是低賤的工作，其實只要我們不太自卑，我想也無所謂的。</p>
<p>就在這種心情下，我在郵電處工作了一月，同時，除了平時寫稿所得的稿酬外，這還是我第一次的賺錢。我珍視着每一塊錢，我要好好地去用它，因爲它是代表幾小時工作的收穫呀！</p>
<h3>雲深處近句</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>寄懷沈瘦東小青浦</p>
<p>城連芳草相望近，氣入高秋美紫蒪，谿水碧來應見底，吟蹤南去恐成眞（聞將有松江之行）；香花橋野思前度，慧老齋深叙舊親（俞慧殊），古有詩人貧一例，祗餘詩卷未能貧。</p>
<p>龍頭渚飲酒家即似季良士沈玄暢鄧散木兼寄施叔範海上</p>
<p>杯底江山間息烽，霸圖長惜欠從容！十千美酒寗無價，一往奇情信未慵；何事少文憐絳灌，轉緣多難笑魚龍！幾年湖海留狂態，烟雨罷頭有舊蹤。</p>

        <h1>1948.11.09</h1>
<h3>President Chiang Analyzes the Military and Political Situation, Economic Difficulties Being Remedied, Collecting Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency "Taken from the People, Used for the People," Encouraging the People to Unite and Struggle Long-Term</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held an enlarged weekly memorial service for the Premier at 9:00 AM on the 8th. More than a thousand responsible comrades from various central ministries and commissions, as well as members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans of our party, attended. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting and provided a detailed analysis of the current military, political, and economic situation. On the military front, the President acknowledged that the loss of important strongholds in the Northeast such as Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou was indeed a serious setback in the revolutionary process. However, frontline commanders such as Liao Yaoxiang and Li Tao acted generously to achieve benevolence, fully demonstrating the spirit of revolutionary soldiers. Regarding the economy, since the currency reform, various difficulties have arisen due to the deliberate sabotage by the communists and the impact of military operations. The government is already taking measures to remedy the situation. The government deeply regrets that patriotic people who supported the national policy during the currency reform, exchanging their hard-earned gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan, are now suffering losses due to price fluctuations. However, the government will adhere to the principle of "taken from the people, used for the people," and adopt practical measures to comfort the patriotic and law-abiding people. President Chiang concluded by stating clearly: "The current war is actually an extension of the War of Resistance. The disruption of national peace is due to the communist rebellion. The government can only achieve peace by eliminating the communist rebellion. All current rumors of peace are merely propaganda offensives by the communists. The government's policy has long been set: to strive for final victory with all our strength. It must be understood that the suppression of the rebellion is a nationalist war, a long-term war. We must prepare for another year of long-term struggle with the determination and spirit of the War of Resistance, unite as one, concentrate our strength, sacrifice and struggle, and then the situation can surely be turned from danger to safety, from defeat to victory, and achieve final victory."</p>
<p>Original Address</p>
<p>President Chiang's original address is as follows: Recently, important strongholds in the Northeast, Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang, have fallen in succession. Furthermore, the communists are spreading rumors everywhere, inevitably causing psychological unrest among the people nationwide. Everyone still remembers when the September 18th Incident occurred, and the three northeastern provinces were lost. At that time, not only was the nation shocked, but all countries around the world were also stunned. Now that the military in the Northeast has suffered such a serious setback, it will naturally cause the same psychological reaction among compatriots as the September 18th Incident. However, from the perspective of the entire revolution, a temporary setback has no major impact on the success or failure of the entire revolution. In 1945, the Northeast Headquarters went to Changchun to prepare to receive sovereignty over the Northeast and encountered various obstacles. Later, when we were ordered to retreat to Shanhaiguan, some responsible comrades said that the Northeast had been lost for fourteen years, and we still could not receive sovereignty, but we were determined to complete the goals of the War of Resistance. Even if the Northeast were to fall again for fourteen years, we would still fight to the death to recover the entire Northeast. This Northeast campaign is the biggest lesson in our revolutionary history, as well as the biggest setback and the most magnificent sacrifice in our revolutionary process. We must never forget it. Our frontline commanders, Commander Liao Yaoxiang and all levels of officers below him, resolutely embraced the determination to live or die with their positions and had reported to me that if they could not recover Jinzhou, they would never return to Shenyang. Later, under the combined encirclement and fierce attacks of the communist troops, Commander Liao and Army Commander Li Tao and others finally died in action with their entire army, achieving a magnificent benevolence. This truly demonstrated the spirit of our revolutionary soldiers, doing justice to the nation and the people, and also proved the importance of the Northeast campaign in the overall communist suppression military operations, leaving an indelible memory for our national revolution.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of economy, the government's policies of currency reform and economic controls have encountered various difficulties in implementation due to the deliberate sabotage by the communists and the impact of military setbacks. The government is now trying to remedy the situation, but everyone knows that there is no perfect solution in the world, and the scope involved in economic reform is particularly complex, and there can absolutely not be only benefits and no drawbacks. As long as we, on the one hand, discover abuses and correct them, and on the other hand, strengthen economic warfare against the communists, so that communist spies cannot create black markets in our cities and villages and snap up materials, then I believe that currency reform can still achieve the effect of stabilizing the economy. What the government particularly regrets is that after the implementation of currency reform, patriotic people, in order to support the national policy, exchanged their hard-earned gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan, and now they are suffering property losses due to price fluctuations. The government is very pleased and concerned about these patriotic and law-abiding compatriots. The government will definitely adhere to the principle of taking from the people and using for the people, and take effective measures to give them comfort. At the same time, we also hope that compatriots in general will not listen to rumors, will not disrupt their own steps, will abide by government laws and regulations, and strive for economic stability.</p>
<h3>No Matter How Difficult the National Affairs, the Lines of Right and Wrong Must Be Established, All Peace Rumors Are Just to Promote Communist Propaganda Offensives</h3>
<p>Since the military setback in the Northeast, the intensity of the communist rumor offensive has reached its extreme. Not only have the general public been incited by rumors and felt panicked, but even intellectuals cannot recognize the true interests of the country and have wavered psychologically. A few days ago, a small number of intellectuals in Nanjing openly published articles proposing peace, which is truly a loss of national spirit and is entirely the act of surrenderists. When the Premier was dying, he said, "You must never compromise with the enemy." This was said to Wang Jingwei. Later, Jingwei not only compromised with the communists, but also compromised with the Japanese, thus not only ruining his personal reputation, but also causing great losses to the entire revolutionary cause. Today, these people obliterate the interests of the country, lose the standpoint of the people, respond to the communist rumor offensive, and advocate surrendering to the communists, which is not only making themselves willing slaves of the communists, but also harming our entire Chinese nation to be slaves and livestock of foreign races forever. Recently, the communists have instructed a general following to put forward two slogans, one is "seek warmth and sustenance," and the other is "seek peace." This is entirely copying the three slogans of "land, bread, truce" from the Soviet civil war era. They want to use this to confuse compatriots across the country and disintegrate the spirit and strength of communist suppression. In fact, compatriots across the country all know that China's current environment is completely different from the national conditions of the Soviet Union at that time. Since the party has been led by the Premier in revolution, realizing the Three Principles of the People has been the only goal, which is also to seek the independence and unity of our country and the survival and freedom of the people. After the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to maintain domestic peace and engage in national construction, the government did not hesitate to compromise and tolerate and repeatedly negotiated with the communists and repeatedly issued orders to stop the conflict. The facts are all there for everyone to see, but the communists finally disregarded everything and rebelled in an all-round way. Today, who is making war and who is preventing the people from being warm and fed? The people of the country should see very clearly. If these intellectuals are not willing to be tools of the communists, then they should go to the communist areas to seek peace and seek warmth and sustenance from Mao Zedong. In fact, communist leader Mao Zedong is vigorously refuting the middle road line and openly advocating world revolution. What peace can be said to be possible with these traitors who are intent on destroying the country and the nation. The national army's policy of suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the communists has long been determined, and it will definitely be implemented to the end. All current rumors of peace are just to promote the communist propaganda offensive and will never affect the determination of our government, military, and civilians to eliminate harm for the country. No matter how difficult or dangerous the national army is, the lines between right and wrong must be established. All responsible comrades in our party, government, and military, and the general public, all have this responsibility.</p>
<h3>Compatriots Should Raise Vigilance</h3>
<p>The Communist Party's "Lenient Policy" Is a Deceptive Conspiracy</p>
<p>Again, we compatriots must also raise our vigilance against the communist's deceptive conspiracy of the so-called "lenient policy." Recently, the communists have repeatedly propagated that they will no longer implement land reform, no longer struggle for liquidation, and claim to protect private property in the occupied areas. Since the fall of Jinan, this disguised lenient propaganda has become even more active. However, we must tell compatriots across the country that the communists' talk of not struggling and not liquidating is only a means of anesthetizing the newly occupied areas. Once they occupy for a little longer, and military violence can control the entire community, they will definitely expose their hideous faces and implement a cruel policy of killing to eliminate dissidents. For example, before Jinan fell, the communists adopted a so-called lenient policy towards the people of Weixian. Before Zhengzhou retreated, they also adopted the same means towards the people of Luoyang, but after the fall of Jinan and the retreat of Zhengzhou, the people who escaped from Weixian and Luoyang said that they had suffered the same tragic fate as their compatriots on the north bank of the Yellow River. All food and materials were plundered by the communists, and the people's livelihood and freedom were arbitrarily slaughtered. Everyone can ask the people who have escaped from the communist areas about these facts. If our compatriots are not vigilant, and do not unite under the leadership of the government to fight for the foundation of the country and for personal survival, then once they are controlled by the communists, there will be no day to turn over.</p>
<h3>Central Political Committee Reviews the Situation, Believing That the Current Goal Should Be to Fully Support the Military</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee held a temporary meeting on the morning of the 8th after the central memorial week. President Chiang personally presided, and Li Zongren, Zhang Zhizhong, and others participated. At the meeting, He Yingqin and Wang Shijie gave separate reports on military and diplomacy. The military report briefly explained the Northeast war and the deployment of the Xu-Beng line. He stated that the deployment of the Xu-Beng line was well-prepared, and if the communists invaded, it would not be enough to shake it. The diplomatic report covered the attendance at the UN General Assembly and diplomatic policies. Then, the members spoke to review the current situation. In the end, a conclusion was reached that the current goal should be to fully support the military and seek military victory. The diplomatic policy part will be studied later, and then the meeting adjourned. No other proposals were discussed at the meeting today.</p>
<h3>Difficult and Dangerous Situation Can Be Turned from Danger to Safety, The Northeast Will Be Recovered With All Our Strength</h3>
<p>Finally, everyone must recognize that the current war is actually an extension of the War of Resistance and is a long-term national war. In February 1946, I once said to compatriots in Shanghai: "Our War of Resistance has been victorious, but we still have to go through a long and arduous struggle for years to truly seek the independence of our country and the freedom of our nation." Our nation's past eight years of resistance and three years of communist suppression were for the purpose of recovering the Northeast and safeguarding our country's lifeline. Even if the Northeast is temporarily lost, we will eventually use the strength of our entire nation to recover it. I want to tell everyone today that although the Northeast military has failed this time, the foundations of politics, economy, and military in the interior have not been shaken in the slightest. Compared with the strength of the communists, we still hold the advantage. The current problem is whether we can strengthen our confidence internally, unite as one, and whether we can boost our spirits and concentrate our strength. If we continue to allow communist spies to spread poisonous propaganda, causing mental distraction and psychological wavering, then the communists, who originally have no strength, can still use various methods to threaten us. Conversely, as long as we can unite our spirits and concentrate our strength to deal with the communists, then no matter how dangerous and difficult the situation is, we can still turn danger into safety and turn defeat into victory. Everyone should recall how rampant the reactionary forces of the communists were in undermining the National Revolution between 1924 and 1925, but we did not waver in our confidence and finally subdued them. Looking at the revolutionary history of these past twenty-odd years, we can believe that my words are absolutely correct. At this time of turbulent situation, the only essential condition is to first seek stability. Only with stability and calmness can we consider new solutions. I hope that responsible comrades in various central departments will be patient and calm, uphold the principle of military first, support the overall decision-making, and conscientiously implement it together. In this way, not only can the overall situation be restored, but the communists can be eliminated sooner. Now the communists are doing everything for the military, and their party, government, and military are all implementing a wartime system, while everything on our side is still in a peacetime state, loose, complicated, and uncoordinated. How to strengthen wartime awareness and implement a wartime system, how to concentrate energy, save time, and seek coordination of work and uniformity of steps, is a question that all comrades should seriously consider. As long as this question can be resolved, then we will definitely be able to break through the difficulties and save the situation. My personal attitude towards doing things in my life is that I will not start a thing unless I have to, and once I start, I must strive for its success. I will not easily undertake any duty, and once I undertake it, I will decide to be responsible to the end. Especially in the past thirty years, I have always solemnly decided before launching any battle, and once launched, no matter what setbacks, difficulties, and failures I go through, I will definitely fight to the end to carry it out to the end. The future communist suppression war, like the War of Resistance, will have to go through countless hardships, but in the end it will definitely achieve its goal. Everyone can believe that I am certain of turning danger into safety, and must strengthen common belief, establish self-confidence, and also believe that the invincible power of the Three Principles of the People and the national spirit will surely lead to the final victory.

And whether it is achievable or not, I must do it. I take burial in Taiyuan City as my final wish, to respond to changes by planning for what should be done, and doing what can be done to the best of my ability. Success or failure should not be considered. Shan is old, and is willing to repay the country, hometown, and friends in this way.</p>
<h3>Collecting US and Hong Kong Dollars to Purchase Grain Abroad, Changing Exchange Rate Being Studied</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] President Chiang stated at the Central Memorial Week on the 8th that the government's collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency will be based on the principle of "taken from the people, used for the people," and practical measures will be taken. Regarding the method of using it, the relevant parties are currently working on it. According to an authoritative source who spoke to reporters on the evening of the 8th, the total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency collected by the government is estimated to be 190 million US dollars, of which US dollars and Hong Kong dollars account for about 60 million US dollars, which will be used first to purchase foreign food and production equipment, etc., and distribute them to the people.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Changing the foreign exchange policy is being studied by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the Transportation Control Committee. Due to the recent price fluctuations, export trade has almost come to a standstill. It is widely believed that the adjustment of foreign exchange rates is an inevitable trend, but whether to adopt a flexible adjustment or a foreign exchange settlement certificate method has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>National Army Launches Encircling and Suppression Operations Against Mobile Bandits South of Chengde</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chengde, 8th] The city of Chengde, which has been armed under a wartime system, has been largely evacuated since the 5th, except for staff from banks, schools, and party and government agencies. Gentry and wealthy merchants are scrambling to evacuate, and the city is sparsely populated, especially quiet at night. Last night, a strong unit of the national army drove into Chengde after defeating the Luange bandit. This morning, they joined forces with various units to target several mobile bandit groups in Chengnan Northeast and launched encircling and suppression operations in separate groups. Therefore, the citizens' bitter faces showed smiles, and prices also rebounded to normal. In addition, the provincial and county governments and postal and telecommunications agencies here are working hard to fulfill their duties.</p>

<h3>How to Prevent Further Economic Deterioration</h3>
<p>Since the lifting of price controls, prices have been like a wild horse that has broken free, galloping and jumping wildly, and have become completely unmanageable. In the past few days, the situation has become increasingly severe, causing Shanghai citizens to feel threatened in their daily lives, filled with unease and anxiety. Although only a short seven or eight days have passed since the lifting of price controls, the prices of rice, cooking oil, flour, coal, and other daily necessities have increased tenfold, and prices vary from morning to evening. The alarming rate of increase has truly caused ordinary people to tremble with fear.</p>
<p>The main reasons for this situation in the Shanghai market are roughly as follows: (1) Market prices are soaring, increasing several times a day; (2) There seems to be planned panic buying of goods such as cotton cloth and cigarettes, making it impossible for merchants to cope, forcing some to temporarily suspend business; (3) Interest rates are too high, making it impossible for legitimate industry and commerce to progress; (4) Large quantities of certain goods are flowing out, and local reserves are dwindling daily; (5) The daily necessities such as rice and oil are not only rising sharply in price, but also in short supply. In fact, when taken together, these boil down to three issues: the price of goods, the supply of goods, and the financial situation. Therefore, to effectively solve the problem, it is necessary to prescribe the right medicine and quickly devise countermeasures to address these issues.</p>
<p>According to the supplementary regulations, future prices should have a portion rapidly determined as a base price, while the remainder should be left to free trade. The so-called base price should be handled by the central government for some goods, and by the local government for others. After a long period of rigid price controls, whether they are goods with a base price or goods subject to free trade, a considerable adjustment must be made due to various real-world reasons. Although this is an inevitable result, we believe that if the goods with a base price can be quickly determined, announced, and implemented one by one, and at the same time, the determined prices can be coordinated and effectively supervised and enforced, then it will not be difficult to quickly establish a new level of prices for all goods. The market is currently in a state of chaos, resembling a burnt-out mess. In addition to strictly prohibiting panic buying, cracking down on hoarding, and maintaining normal order to reverse this chaotic situation, it still seems necessary to follow the above-mentioned approach to quickly seek remedies in order to stabilize prices. Otherwise, the goods subject to free trade, due to the lack of constraints, will indeed run wild like a runaway horse, while the goods with a base price will all use the excuse of being at a loss as to what to do and engage in widespread discussions, seeking exorbitant profits, or openly suspending business and enjoying the benefits of hoarding. If things continue in this way, it is hard to imagine what kind of situation the market chaos will evolve into.</p>
<p>The issue of goods supply includes two important factors: increasing production and streamlining the source of supply, with the latter being even more crucial in the current emergency situation. Specific measures, in addition to facilitating transportation, subsidizing funds, and immediately abolishing the bans on goods leaving the area, should focus on the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Because after a long period of price controls and requisitioning, farmers have suffered greatly and are unwilling to bring various agricultural products to the market, either storing them at home to wait and see, or delaying harvesting to avoid excessive taxation, or imitating the fashionable slogans popular in the city, calling for bartering. Implement a policy of exchanging surplus rice for surplus cloth. As a result, cities are empty, unable to hoard, and even less able to meet the needs of large cities. Rice and grain are now allowed to flow freely, and the unauthorized bans on exports between various regions have also been effectively cracked down on, but large cities and inland cities are still generally suffering from food shortages, precisely because this main problem has not been solved.</p>
<p>As for the urgent shortage of money, there are too many reasons, and there is no need to analyze them further here. However, if the fundamental problem of an abundance of idle capital is not resolved, then the shift in the direction of money laundering and the prosperity of national savings will inevitably fluctuate, tightening and loosening alternately, making it impossible to effectively control. Therefore, the fundamental solution lies in regulating issuance and contracting currency to stabilize the financial market. If, due to time-sensitive relationships, merchants have too little capital, hindering their legitimate business, then it is the duty of the national bank to consider how to use surpluses to help deficits, open up loans, and regulate market interest rates, which should not be without solutions.</p>
<p>In short, since the revision of economic policies, the adverse effects that have occurred in all aspects have been too profound, causing the general public to re-enter a state of confusion. If this situation is allowed to continue and is not quickly remedied, it is feared that it will escalate from economic problems to social problems and even public security problems, which is truly an event that cannot be ignored! It is hoped that all relevant responsible authorities will quickly take the necessary actions to prevent the economic situation from deteriorating further!</p>
<h3>Far East Tribunal Announces Verdict - Itagaki Identified as Chief Culprit of Aggression Against China - Ranked as One of Two Principal Offenders Alongside Doihara</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] The International Military Tribunal for the Far East has formally determined that September 18, 1931, was the beginning of Japan's aggression against China, and that the "September 18th Incident" was also the spark that ignited World War II. In the final verdict announced by the Tribunal today, it was specified that Japan was the aggressor in the fifteen-year Sino-Japanese War, that the September 18th Incident was premeditated by the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, and that this plan was clearly part of Japan's "overall plan" to control China. The Tribunal announced today that Itagaki Seishiro and Doihara Kenji were the two principal offenders in the September 18th Incident, and that several incidents subsequently created by Japan were also carried out by them, ultimately leading to the Sino-Japanese War. The Tribunal's verdict contains two lengthy sections narrating Itagaki and Doihara's various misdeeds in the history of Japanese aggression. Others, such as Araki Sadao, Umezu Yoshijiro, Muto Akira, Hirota Koki, Oshima Hiroshi, Umezu Yoshijiro, Tojo Hideki, Kido Koichi, Minami Jiro, Hashimoto Kingoro, Okawa Shumei, Matsui Iwane, Hiranuma Kiichiro, Koiso Kuniaki, were also named in the verdict as principal figures in the aggression against China. The verdict also stated that Japan began to invade China after the Tanaka Cabinet came to power in 1927. Extreme nationalist organizations such as the Black Dragon Society also supported this policy, and Itagaki, Doihara, and leaders of the Japanese political and military circles, such as Hiranuma, Koiso, and Araki, were all related to these organizations. The Tribunal also declared that Itagaki Seishiro was the first Japanese military man to publicly advocate the military occupation of Northeast China. Itagaki's policy was approved by Minami Jiro and executed with the assistance of Doihara. Doihara was the chief advisor and coordinator of this plan, and Itagaki and Doihara were also the main planners for the establishment of the puppet governments of "Manchukuo" and Wang Jingwei. The Tribunal also specifically emphasized that the people of Northeast China and the headquarters were not demanding a movement to establish a new government.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Sugar City - Zizhong</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Chengdu, 3rd Day Airmail] Sichuan is the largest sugar-producing area in our country. The Tuo and Fu River basins cover 46 counties, with over 8 million *mu* of sugarcane planting area. According to a Taipei telegram from Taibao on the 3rd of last month, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in order to develop the sugarcane industry in Sichuan and Guangdong, decided to jointly establish the Sichuan Sugar Factory in Yinshan Town, Zizhong, Sichuan, with the Ziyuan Committee. Because of this exciting news of developing the sugarcane industry in Sichuan, our reporter took advantage of the clear autumn weather to come to Zizhong, the second largest sugar city in Sichuan located in the heart of the Tuo River basin, and spent half a day quickly observing the recent sugarcane production situation in Sichuan.</p>
<p>The Sugar City's Hardships – Natural and Man-Made Disasters</p>
<p>Zizhong is located more than 300 *li* east of Chengdu and is the second largest sugar-producing area in Sichuan, second only to Neijiang. Generally, when speaking of Sichuan sugar, Neijiang is often taken as the representative. However, in terms of future development, Zizhong possesses far more conditions than Neijiang. Stepping into this beautiful sugar city surrounded by rivers on three sides, sugarcane forests are lush everywhere, and chimneys stand tall, presenting an extraordinary scene under the autumn sun and twilight. There are about 800 large and small sugar workshops throughout the county, with sugar-producing areas including Yinshan, Qiuxi, Taiping, Longshan, and more than ten towns. There are more than 200 sugarcane production cooperatives. Statistics show that last year's total sugar production was over 57 million *jin* (catty). According to surveys, in Zizhong, which spans over 100 *li* and has a population of 300,000 to 400,000, about 70% to 80% of the people directly or indirectly depend on the sugar industry for their livelihood. The reporter arrived in Zizhong just in time for the annual harvest season, but due to the summer floods and the overflowing of the Tuo River, the sugarcane production suffered greatly. Furthermore, coupled with the currency crisis in the autumn, Zizhong was hit by the price surges in Chengdu and Chongqing. The capital represented by sugar workshops and the labor represented by sugarcane farmers are generally in a recession. Everyone wears a worried and bitter expression, with feelings of desolation and depression. This indicates that Zizhong's sugar industry this year is facing an unprecedented contraction.</p>
<p>Production Decline - Two Reasons</p>
<p>The current situation of the sugar industry in Zizhong represents the general recession of the sugar industry in Sichuan. According to the opinions of people from three levels – sugar workshops, small refineries, and sugarcane farmers – the fundamental reasons for the recession are: First, the sharp rise in prices and economic turmoil have caused a disconnect between production costs, sugar prices, and commodity prices. For example, in January of this year, the price of sugar was 80 million *yuan* (legal tender) per 10,000 *jin*, and in October it rose to 5,000 gold *yuan* (equivalent to 15 billion legal tender). However, the fluctuation of grain prices far exceeded this, and sugarcane farmers' income from growing sugarcane was far less than the profit from miscellaneous grains. As a result, some sugarcane farmers switched to growing sweet potatoes this year. Secondly, loans are difficult to obtain. For example, this year's sugarcane loans in Zizhong totaled only 45 billion, averaging 1.5 million per *mu* (equivalent to 0.5 gold *yuan*). At the same time, Sichuan provincial banks recently stopped sugar loans due to capital increase issues. With rising prices and high sugarcane prices, sugarcane farmers feel unable to maintain their livelihoods and switch to other occupations, while small refineries and sugar workshops reduce production due to their inability to raise funds. The sugar industry naturally falls into recession. The second reason is the lack of coordination between labor and capital. The three levels of sugarcane production – sugarcane farmers, small refineries, and sugar workshops – previously adopted the "selling green sugarcane" system of pre-selling autumn sugarcane. Now, the "evaluation policy" is adopted, but both sides have conflicts of interest, and their feelings are not harmonious. For example, the "Zizhong Sugar Riot" that shook Sichuan last year, in which sugarcane farmers destroyed the county government, is an example. Due to the different paces of these three aspects, they have failed to work together for progress, which has limited the sugar industry's production significantly.</p>
<p>Outdated Methods - Awaiting Improvement</p>
<p>As a major obstacle to the progress of the Sichuan sugar industry, there is also the outdated production method. Walking around Zizhong, it is difficult to find a modern sugar factory. The sugar-making process is purely old-fashioned. The process is: First, the sugar workshop presses the sugarcane into juice and boils it to produce raw sugar. Second, the small refinery further processes and refines it to produce refined sugar. The tools are stone mills, iron pots, earthenware bowls, mud, and animal power, relying on the experience of old-fashioned "sugar-boiling masters." From pressing the sugarcane to producing sugar, it takes more than a month, making both cost and time uneconomical. It is truly difficult for Sichuan sugar produced by this extremely old-fashioned method to compete with mechanized sugar production.</p>
<p>Another factor is the limitation of climate and soil. Sugarcane is a tropical product. Looking at the sugar-producing areas around the world, such as Cuba, India, Java, and our country's Taiwan, Guangdong, etc., the latitude is below 25 degrees, and the average temperature is above 20 degrees. Sichuan's latitude is above 26 degrees, and the average temperature is below 17 degrees. Due to the colder climate and shorter growing season, coupled with the fact that more than two-thirds of Zizhong's sugarcane soil is mountain soil (mountain soil is better than plain soil), and the land is located in a hilly area, it is not easy to concentrate sugarcane. Due to these two limitations, Zizhong sugarcane farmers mostly use the seedling planting method, with a two-year rotation. Natural development is greatly hindered.</p>
<p>When discussing the improvement of Sichuan sugar, Zizhong sugar industry personnel place unlimited expectations on Taiwan Sugar Corporation's establishment of a factory in Zizhong. It is generally believed that the improvement of Sichuan sugar should focus on: First, improving production methods. Second, transplanting superior sugarcane varieties and improving cultivation methods.</p>
<p>Sichuan sugar has a long history of nearly 300 years. In the past, its output was the highest in the country, selling throughout the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the northwest and Kangzang areas. During the War of Resistance against Japan and the suppression of the rebellion, it made glorious contributions to the people's food supply and the national tax revenue in the rear areas. Sichuan sugar should have a future. Taiwan Sugar Corporation's establishment of a factory in Zizhong undoubtedly brings a bright future to the development of Sichuan sugar.</p>

<h3>The United States is Considering Various Diplomatic Issues; New Policies to be Adopted Towards China; Truman Flies to the Little White House for Vacation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The United States is apparently prepared to take various steps to join the North Atlantic Military Alliance. This is the result of a series of White House foreign policy discussions over the weekend. During his short stay in Washington, Truman met with Undersecretary of State Lovett three times. It is reported that Lovett briefed the President on major foreign policy issues, including the situation in China. The President apparently approved Lovett's continued negotiations to complete the North Atlantic defense plan. Although there are rumors of personnel changes among senior U.S. foreign policy officials, it is generally expected that Truman will retain the current officials, at least until the next Congress approves his foreign policy program. The program may include: (1) Asking the Senate to approve the North Atlantic Military Alliance; (2) New measures to deal with the critical situation in China; (3) Allocating funds for the second year of the European Recovery Program, while stipulating new military lend-lease assistance methods. Friends of Secretary of State Marshall say that Marshall's intention to resign is firm and there is no question, but if the President insists on him remaining in office for a period of time, Marshall will undoubtedly agree. At the same time, if Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Lovett are retained by Truman for a month or two, they may also agree. Regarding the next steps in advancing the North Atlantic Treaty, the State Department will likely consult with Republican Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Democratic Senator Connally within days. Connally is expected to become Chairman of the Committee in the next Congress. Meanwhile, the five Western European countries are drafting a treaty to present to the United States within a week or ten days as a basis for substantive negotiations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Key West, 7th, United Press] The entire city turned out to welcome President Truman, who was re-elected. In this election, the city supported Truman by a ratio of ten to one. The President came here to vacation at the Little White House at the submarine base. Military bands and victory parades proceeded along the way, and the crowds on the roadside cheered. One road has already been renamed "Truman Street." The President arrived here on the "Independence" special plane at 3:50 PM Eastern Standard Time. On the way, he made a short stop in New Bern, North Carolina, to attend the worship service at the First Baptist Church, which has a history of 100 years. Several members of the President's staff accompanied him on this trip. However, Truman told reporters that this trip was indeed for vacation and that there would be no rest for several days. His first goal is to rest and relax, and the vacation is scheduled for two weeks. However, Truman will release important news before the end of the vacation.</p>
<h3>Hopes for Improved U.S.-Soviet Relations; Secretary Marshall to Return Home for Consultation; Argentine Foreign Minister to Confer with British Counterpart to Resolve Berlin Crisis</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the anniversary of the revolution yesterday was moderate in tone, and diplomatic circles here are speculating that there may be hope for improved U.S.-Soviet relations. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall may return home this month to consult with President Truman on everything.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The Chairman of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, is now in England to confer with Foreign Secretary Bevin on resolving the Berlin issue. It is reported that Bramuglia advocates that the four major powers should hold consultations to resolve the Berlin issue in order to obtain the preconditions for an agreement. It is reported that Bramuglia may convene a meeting of representatives of neutral countries in the Security Council in Paris on the 10th. According to some sources, Bramuglia will suggest that the Berlin issue should be discussed directly by the four major powers.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of Defense Announces Retirement Next Year</h3>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Secretary of the Navy Sullivan were photographed by reporters at the White House today. Reporters asked, "Will the Secretaries serve for another four years?" Forrestal replied, "Not me alone." A reporter asked if Forrestal planned to leave the Truman administration, and his aide replied, "He probably has no intention of staying in office for another four years." [United Press, Washington, 7th] If U.S. Secretary of State Marshall insists on resigning, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas became the best candidate favored by members of Congress to become Secretary of State on the 7th. Douglas has the support of many members of Congress, and their opinions will likely carry significant weight when the time comes to choose a Secretary of State. Douglas visited President Truman on the 6th to prepare to return to London.</p>

According to the conclusions of the cabinet meeting that ended last week, it was decided to prohibit government civil servants from participating in marches, and those who violate the law will be punished for dereliction of duty.</p>
<h3>Political Committee Postpones Vote on Charges Against Greece's Three Neighboring Countries; Execution of Greek Labor Leaders Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] The Soviet bloc representatives in the United Nations Political Committee on the 8th struggled to change the action against Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia for aiding Greek guerrillas. This even led to a personal dispute between Soviet representative Malik and Yugoslav representative Bebler and Political Committee Chairman Spaak. After Bebler failed in a series of actions to prevent the vote of Western countries, he accused the Political Committee of siding with one side.</p>
<p>At this point, Spaak roared, "We cannot tolerate insults!" Bebler did not dare to show weakness, frequently waving his finger and saying in fluent French, "It is our country that has been insulted." The final vote on the Balkan issue will be postponed to the evening of the 13th.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] UN General Assembly President Evatt today sent a telegram to Greek King Paul and Prime Minister Sophoulis, requesting a stay of execution for the ten labor leaders sentenced to death by the Athens military court.

<h3>Iranian Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 7th] The resignation of the Hakimir Cabinet here is not surprising, as the government only received 67 votes out of 107 votes in the last cabinet vote of confidence.

<h3>Most of This Year's World Rice Crop is Abundant</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported today that world rice production this year has almost reached pre-war levels. The harvest for 1948-49 is estimated at 7.3 billion bushels, compared to 7.1 billion bushels last year and a pre-war average of about 7.45 billion bushels. The increase in production this year is mainly due to more abundant harvests in most rice-producing countries, especially Japan, Korea, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. The above-mentioned countries have made progress in restoring pre-war planting levels. China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Ceylon also had abundant harvests. The total production in Europe, Africa, and North America is also comparable to last year's record. The world's rice planting area has increased by about 3% compared to pre-war levels, but the average yield per *mu* is inevitably lower than before due to fertilizer shortages and poor soil in some areas. Political unrest in Vietnam has prevented a large increase in planting area. Siam is the only rice exporting country in Asia, and the planting area has been continuously increasing since the end of the war.</p>

<h3>Truman Recently Stated in Washington That He is Willing to Meet MacArthur Immediately; Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the Tokyo Tribunal Announced After Returning to Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] According to what Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East revealed on the 8th. President Truman intends to invite MacArthur to return to the United States to discuss matters together, as soon as MacArthur can leave Japan. Keenan recently returned to Japan from the United States. He said: When he met with the President, he believed that Truman intended to meet with MacArthur, and there was no political intention.</p>
<p>Keenan also said: President Truman is eager to meet with MacArthur, but there has been no indication from Tokyo that MacArthur has received President Truman's invitation. In the past, MacArthur has politely declined all invitations to return home, citing reasons such as being too busy with official duties or that during the presidential election, MacArthur's return home would be misunderstood as having political implications.</p>
<h3>U.S. Holds Major Naval and Air Exercises in Southern Newfoundland</h3>

<h3>Authorities to Hold Emergency Meeting Today to Sell Off Goods and Contract Currency; Principle Decision to First Sell Off Part of the Cotton Yarn and Sugar</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The degree of price fluctuations in the city in the past three days can be described as unprecedented. The reasons for this, in addition to the impact of the Sulu war on people's minds, another important factor is the large influx of hot money from North China. The amount of hot money arriving in Shanghai every day exceeds 100 million gold yuan at the highest and is at least 50 million or more at the lowest, and the only outlet for this batch of hot money is to snap up goods. It is learned that the relevant authorities in the city intend to re-adopt the method of selling off goods and contracting currency in order to cope with the situation, but some modifications will be made technically. Director Wu Kaixian visited Yu Jilu, chief secretary of the Economic Inspection Committee of the Central Bank, and Li Lixia, chairman of the Goods Adjustment Committee, yesterday morning to make preliminary consultations on this matter. It was decided in principle to first allocate a portion of cotton yarn and sugar from the Central Bank and implement the sale starting today. As for the source of the goods to be sold off and the detailed implementation methods, they will be decided at today's Goods Adjustment Meeting.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Shanghai Economic Supervisor's Office, in order to regulate the Shanghai market's goods and review various negotiated prices in order to stabilize prices, will hold a temporary emergency meeting at the National Bank Supervisor's Office at 9:30 AM today (9th). It will be personally presided over by Supervisor Yu Hongjun. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy President Liu, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others will be invited to attend. Important decisions will be made on the financial economy and prices in Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Kaixian, City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Shanghai Supervisor Tao Baichuan, Chairman of the City Local Association Du Yuesheng, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, and other people concerned about the food and price issues of the citizens of Shanghai, yesterday morning at 9:00, discussed how to solve the current difficult issues. It has now been decided that in addition to dredging the source to smooth its flow and bartering goods to strive for balance, the city relief association will start the porridge factory this winter early to benefit the poor.</p>
<h3>Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Advocates Distributing Flour Day and Night</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian said yesterday: The authorities have discussed and decided to start with contracting currency and supplying food as much as possible to deal with the current crazy prices. Taiwan Sugar Corporation and China Textile Corporation will sell off sugar and yarn in large quantities starting today, and all inventory of the Goods Supply Bureau will also be put on the market as much as possible. Regarding the food problem, the supply of household rice in October is insufficient, so flour will be temporarily used instead. There is a lot of flour in storage, so the supply can be guaranteed. Rice merchants are also transporting rice purchased from producing areas to Shanghai one after another. Currently, because people are panic-stricken, the queues in front of distribution stores are extremely crowded. He will suggest concentrating several distribution points in each district to distribute day and night to reduce crowding. Director Wu said: The government has issued distribution certificates and will definitely be responsible for distribution. Even if it is overdue, it can still be collected. Therefore, he hopes that those with stored grain will not rush to squeeze, so that citizens without overnight grain can receive it first.</p>
<h3>7,000 Loads of Rice Allocated in Advance for College and University Students</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The food problem in the city is serious. Due to the large number of resident students in major colleges and universities, procurement is difficult, and there is a danger of running out of food. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, more than 30 presidents of public and private colleges and universities, including Zhang Yi, Wang Zhizhuo, Li Shouyong, Ou Yuanhuai, and Wang Yukai, visited Mayor Wu Kaixian to request assistance in solving the difficulties. After Mayor Wu and the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Food Allocation Committee negotiated, they decided to take emergency measures and allocate 7,000 loads of rice for counting heads for November in advance for the schools to eat. The presidents of major colleges and universities decided to discuss the distribution issues at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 10:00 this morning and exchange opinions on the current situation.</p>
<h3>Hoarded Rice Ordered to be Unsealed and Distributed for Food Supply</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The police bureau previously seized more than 4,800 bags of hoarded rice during the general inspection of goods. Yesterday, it was approved by the mayor to order the batch of hoarded rice to be unsealed and allocated to the Civil Food Allocation Committee for distribution to supply food to the people.</p>
<h3>Public School Teacher Rice Allocation - Collective Distribution</h3>
<p>It is understood that the October rice allocation for public school teachers in this city will be changed, starting immediately, to avoid crowding, queuing, and waiting. Each recipient unit will directly collect and distribute the rice from the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse.</p>
<h3>Concrete Measures Obtained to Divert Rice Sources</h3>
<p>Dispatching Police to Protect Rice Shops and Wharves</p>
<p>In order to dispel the city's panic about the rice shortage, Mayor Wu summoned Police Bureau Chief Yu Shuping, Director of Civil Food Allocation Office Lu Guixiang, rice industry representative Wan Molin, Head of the Social Bureau's Food Section Ji Mingqi, and more than ten others yesterday morning to discuss measures to divert rice sources to supply the market. Concrete results have been achieved. The mayor also instructed the police bureau to dispatch police to protect various rice shops and wharves, such as Fengji Wharf in the Nanshi area, both sides of the Suzhou River at the Sichuan Road Bridge, the Datong Road Fuxin Wharf area near the Wujin Road Bridge and Hengfeng Road Bridge, the entrance of the Seventh Factory, the Lao Zha Bridge pier, and Shihuigang, among other places. The Rice Industry Association will be responsible for designating several rice shops in each district for centralized supply. It is generally believed that the distribution of household rice and the order of ordinary rice supply will improve from now on.</p>
<h3>Authorities Issue Solemn Statement That There Are Absolutely No Problems With Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors suddenly spread in the city, saying, "The British-owned water and electricity companies in this city will suspend water and electricity supply starting today due to a shortage of coal." The municipal authorities issued a solemn statement, saying, "The city has sufficient coal reserves, and we have purchased a large amount of coal from home and abroad, which will be shipped to Shanghai successively. There is no need to worry about shortages. Water and electricity supply is absolutely no problem. The above rumors are obviously spread deliberately by bandits, hoping to confuse people's minds and disrupt social order. We hope that citizens throughout the city will not believe them easily, in order to shatter the bandits' rumor-mongering scheme."</p>
<h3>Pork and Vegetable Prices Continue to Rise Sharply - Mayor Summons Both Industries and Orders Monitoring of the Market</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Mayor Wu, concerned about the continuous rise in pork and vegetable prices in recent days, which poses a significant threat to people's livelihood, summoned the responsible persons of both trade associations yesterday morning for talks. According to the responsible persons of the associations, the price increases are not caused by the associations but by retailers, because there has been no phenomenon of daily price increases at the wholesale level. Mayor Wu ordered them to be responsible for monitoring the market from today. If any retailers are found to be attempting to make excessive profits, they should be reported. From today, the wholesale price will be determined daily by the association, and the retail price will be the wholesale price plus legitimate profit. If there are any further incidents of disrupting the market or raising prices, the association will be held responsible, and severe punishment will be imposed if necessary. The responsible persons of both associations accepted this. However, the Vegetable Industry Association requested a postponement of implementation until tomorrow due to the general household inspection held yesterday, which was agreed to by Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Export Trade Completely Stalled - Merchants Hope for Restoration of Loans as Funds Are Difficult to Procure Goods</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Seventy days after the currency reform, the export industry has completely stalled. According to the opinions of people in the export industry, the way to save the situation is to adjust the exchange rate and restore the certificate of exchange system, and it is also necessary to restore export usance and packing loans in order to be effective. The reason is that the price of export goods is rising too fast. The funds obtained by exporters for selling exchange certificates are not enough to purchase goods in the production areas in terms of time, so it is necessary to restore various export loans to make up for this. Another difficulty to be overcome is that farmers in production areas, due to their knowledge, value goods and belittle currency. Since the currency reform, purchasing merchants often convert legal tender into gold and silver as payment tools. Today, gold and silver have been nationalized, so this method is no longer applicable, but the farmers' concept remains unchanged, and how to solve this in the future remains to be planned. At present, the market for export goods is almost completely stalled. In Shanghai, there is a market but no transactions, and prices often fluctuate at low levels. Taking the market price of tung oil as an example, it was only 260 yuan last weekend, and transactions could not be carried out. The extent of the price increase of tung oil in Hankou and Chongqing last weekend was far below that of other goods. Another major export commodity, bristles, suffered from the tightening of the battle situation in northern Jiangsu last weekend, and the source of supply was cut off. The owners held on to their goods and refused to release them, and transactions were stalled. Tea leaves had a slight uptick in transactions last weekend, but transactions have now stalled again. In summary, judging from the current situation of the export industry, unless the government takes strong action on the exchange rate and other aspects, it is difficult to expect a revival in the short term.</p>
<h3>Report From City Executive Reporter - Rice Sources Are Not Expected to Be Interrupted - 80,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Can Be Shipped Soon - Telegram Sent Requesting Speedy Allocation of Rice From Taiwan to Meet Emergency Needs - Those Who Gather to Seize Rice Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Mayor Wu, concerned that the rice market in the city has been extremely chaotic recently, and that there were incidents of rice seizure in various places yesterday, met with reporters from various newspapers at the city government office at 6:00 PM yesterday to report that rice sources are not expected to be interrupted. The city has ordered 80,000 tons of foreign rice, including 60,000 tons of US aid rice and 20,000 tons of rice from the Central Trust Bureau, all of which have been purchased separately and are ready. Once the transportation problem is resolved, they can be continuously supplied to Shanghai. Also, for temporary emergency relief, Mayor Wu spoke with President Weng on the phone yesterday, requesting that he consult with Wei Daoming, Chairman of Taiwan Province, as soon as possible and find ways to rush 10,000 tons of rice to Shanghai in the shortest possible time. Since Chairman Wei is currently in Beijing on important official business, President Weng agreed to find a way.</p>
<p>The city government attaches great importance to the recent out-of-line actions of gathering to seize rice at several rice shops in the city. Mayor Wu also expressed his great anger about this. Since Commander Xuan has gone to Beijing, he contacted Bao, a staff officer of the Garrison Headquarters, yesterday, saying that for the sake of the safety of all citizens in the city, everyone should rise up to stop them. After consultation yesterday, it was decided that the authorities will severely punish those who seize rice in order to maintain local security and social order, and will do their best to protect rice merchants so that rice sources can continuously come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, Mayor Wu visited Mr. Lapham of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the rice supply problem. Mr. Lapham said that the US will do its best to provide assistance. The authorities are currently discussing adopting a barter trade method for rice. In addition, they also discussed emergency rescue plans, but they will not be announced until they are approved by the US.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu finally pointed out that the cause of the rice panic was due to the central government's price limit policy. Because at the end of September, he knew that the city had 300,000 *zu* of rice in storage. Due to the price limit, no new rice came to Shanghai in 50 days, causing a rice panic. Now the authorities have found a way, and they hope that citizens will be patient during this transition period.</p>
<h3>Lapham Issues Solemn Statement - US Aid Food Resumes Distribution - Witnessing the Severity of the Food Shortage - Efforts to Expedite Shipment to China</h3>
<p>[ECA, Shanghai, 8th] Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, issued a written statement today as follows:</p>
<p>First of all, I must explain to the enduring people of the major cities in China that US aid food is expected to resume food distribution in the major cities in December.</p>
<p>"Seeing is believing" is not an empty saying. When I returned to China from the US last week and witnessed the hardship of the people here seeking food, I was shocked. When I was in Washington, although I received reports from the branch office and learned about the food shortage caused by improper economic policies and poor planning here, I did not initially expect the suffering of people of all classes to be so severe.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Food Are Being Shipped</p>
<p>The food supplied by the US side has been fully implemented. The initial plan was that US aid food would be distributed and sold in the cities again in January next year, while the needs of the autumn of this year would be met by purchasing rice and wheat domestically in China. However, when I received news in Washington that this procurement was on the verge of failure, I immediately sought to expedite the shipment of US aid food already ordered by the ECA to China.</p>
<p>Large quantities of wheat and flour are on their way to China, and large quantities of food are also being shipped from Tacoma, Washington, and various ports on the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, a large quantity of rice can be shipped from Siam to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou by the end of this month. We are now doing our best to expedite transportation.</p>
<p>Working Together to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>We firmly believe that starting in December, we plan to use US aid food to provide the majority of the quantity needed for distribution for several months. We are currently planning to assist the Chinese government in procuring food locally in order to reduce the difficulties experienced by the people of the cities this month.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, everyone should have the spirit of doing their best in their jobs and serving the public, in order to work together to overcome the difficulties. The US Economic Cooperation Administration is prepared to do its best within its capabilities.</p>
<p>All of our work this year and next year is proceeding according to plan. The cotton and oil plans will be completed, and fertilizers are being purchased. Cotton yarn and textiles made from US aid cotton will be used to exchange for food. The difficulties currently encountered only indicate that the work of the US ECA in the future should be doubled compared to usual.</p>
<p>I come from a country that loves peace and independence and advocates the spirit of production and self-reliance. We hope that the Chinese people can enjoy the same happiness. This is the purpose of our work in China.</p>
<h3>Several More Incidents of Rice Seizure</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still several incidents of rice and flour seizure in the city. They were all quelled by the police bureau and the Flying Fortress rushing to the scene.

<h3>Chief Accountant of Hongxing Shenzhuang Suspected of Illegal Foreign Exchange Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Chen Deming (fugitive), manager of Hongxing Shenzhuang in this city, and Su Zhipeng, the chief accountant, and Zhou Yao, an employee, were prosecuted yesterday by the Special Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of illegally exchanging Hong Kong currency. The Zhuang was accused of frequently exchanging Hong Kong currency privately for profit. Its telegrams with Hong Kong were all sent by the Oriental Economic Research Institute's Detective Station. The station recorded all telegrams daily into a reconnaissance code daily report compilation card and sent it to the Municipal Police Bureau to send personnel to investigate. Because Chen was not there, Lin and Zhou were sent to be investigated.

A public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>[This newspaper report] The first large-scale household check and national identity card exchange work after the victory in this city was actively promoted by the Household Check and Certificate Exchange Committee composed of relevant agencies, and was fully completed last night in a very smooth manner, following the announced procedures. This check was held at the same time, and the city is vast, so the authorities mobilized nearly 100,000 staff members, including police, military police, teachers, students, construction team personnel, and household registration personnel. They gathered at the security office after the preliminary siren was sounded at 6:00 PM yesterday to prepare everything. Starting at 7:00 PM, all public transportation vehicles entered the factory in accordance with the regulations. The military police were also dispatched to the streets to urge pedestrians to go home. At 8:00 PM, the closure siren rang loudly, and the streets were cold and empty. All theaters and entertainment venues had previously announced the temporary suspension of night shows, and the iron gates were tightly closed. Only neon lights flickered in the sky, and the city was completely in a state of stillness. After 9:00 PM, the checkers began to be dispatched and checked household by household. The residents, having known the procedures in advance, had prepared new and old documents and application forms. The checkers followed the principle of "one-to-one stamping" and only collected the cost of the new certificate on the spot, which was four corners per person. Each household was successfully completed in about one or two minutes, and the order was orderly. At the same time, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, also broadcast the main points of the check on Shanghai Radio Station. All radio stations in the city also broadcast the dynamics of the check at any time. Yu Shuping, Director of the Police Bureau, also went to Nanshi, Pudong, various wharves, the North Station, and the suburbs of Dachang with Lu Xia, Director of the Traffic Section, and Wu Yan, Head of the Special Household Registration Group, to inspect traffic control and the check situation. The special household registration check also dispatched 104 teams to carry out the check on various hotels, refugee areas, water households, and garrison troops. The process was extremely good.</p>
<p>The last passenger train at the two railway stations departed at 10:00 PM. There were not many passengers, and they all entered the station before 7:30 PM. After 7:30 PM, all passenger cars from Beijing to Shanghai only reached Nanxiang. There were no passengers at the North Station, only police officers on guard. However, a special tax police train departed at 12:30 AM.</p>
<p>Brothels such as Huileyi have stopped operating, and the "public house" area has also closed early. Prostitutes either waited for the checkers to arrive or huddled in bed, presenting a cold atmosphere.</p>
<p>The check officially ended after the alarm was lifted at 3:00 AM this morning. The total population of Greater Shanghai will be counted and announced by the Certificate Exchange Committee within five days.</p>

The court president Shen Tianbao and two judges, Xie Zhiying and Shao Renjie, opened a collegial panel for the fourth trial yesterday morning and summoned Wang Chao, the person in charge of Wujin Electric Company, to appear in court. The case could have been concluded yesterday, only because another important witness, Zhang Baotong, the person in charge of Suzhou Electric Company, did not arrive. The court did not respond to the request of the defendant Sun Jice and his defense lawyer and scheduled to summon Zhang as a witness on the 17th of this month before giving a final ruling. According to witness Wang Chao, in order to seek business convenience, it is true that he paid the donation raised by Director Sun and gave gifts during the New Year and festivals. The donation was counted twice, one for 2,000 legal currency and the other for 100 gold yuan. The donations were received by Director Sun. Regarding the gifts given during the New Year and festivals, at the end of last year, he gave Director Sun a Parker pen and Section Chief Lin a Movado watch, and also gave each of them six cartons of Carle Cigarettes. During the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, he gave them several bottles of famous wine. The court asked Sun Jice whether the gifts provided by the witness were true. Sun said that he did not receive the pen, but he did receive the cigarettes. Regarding the donation, it was a temporary loan and he intended to return it later, but they insisted on not accepting it. Other than that, he did not receive any bribes. Later, Le Zhuangxin, head of the investigation section of the Municipal Government, who handled the case, submitted photos to the court, saying that Suzhou Electric Company paid Sun Jice's check, one was from Xinhua Bank on February 18, and the other was from China Bank on September 21. The China check was exchanged by Xinzhong Qianzhuang after investigation. Xinzhong said that it was sent by Xianglan Chemical Factory. Xianglan said that it was delivered by Chongqing Bank. Finally, it was found that it was delivered by Sun, and the court asked Sun about it. Sun was vague and unable to answer, saying that it was borrowed from Suzhou Electric Company. The court repeatedly interrogated the two defendants, Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao, on the two points of "purchasing certificate" and "distributing tips". The testimonies were the same as before. Finally, the other defendants were asked one by one, and then the defense lawyers of the defendants debated successively. Finally, except for the defendant Sun Zhigang, who was granted bail, the other eleven defendants were returned to custody. The court ordered that witness Zhang Bintong be summoned on the 17th before the trial.</p>

Zhoupu seed cotton was shouted at 360 yuan per load in the morning, creating the peak after the price limit was opened. Later, a few holders needed it for lack of orders, so they sold at a high price, and the price returned to 40 yuan. It was soft again after the high price in the afternoon, and the shouting price fell by 20 yuan again.</p>
<h3>Silk Continues to be Popular</h3>
<p>There are very few chips on the artificial silk market. Silk weaving industry is very suspicious of whether CITIC will continue to supply next week. The transaction of the industry is extremely deserted. The small silk factories are increasing and decreasing, and the people are very firm. The market is rising wildly. No. 120 Tianqiao shouted 17,000 yuan, and 18,000 yuan slightly supplied and sold. Dongyang shouted 18,000 yuan, and 19,000 yuan bought in.

<p>Raw silk has continued to rise in recent days, and the market is soaring in a straight line. The premium retail is shouted at 19,000 yuan, and there is a supply on the market. However, due to the scarcity of sources, the industry is quite expected.</p>
<p>Web satin is being absorbed by the street and the gang as much as possible, and the supply is less than the demand, and the market is stepping up. Huaqiang was first shouted at 7,500 yuan, and there were purchases, but no goods were sold. The price rose straight up, and finally did to 9,500 yuan. The rest of the winter colors are very sharp.</p>

<h3>Food Rice Arrives Rarely and the Off-site Bidding Price Rises Amazingly</h3>
<p>Food rice arrives rarely, 90 stones arrive in the Nanshi market, and 550 stones arrive in the Beishi market, a total of 640 stones. Most of them are self-operated by rice shops and rice factories, which are directly sold to the retail store, so the market transaction has not been opened. The quotation of the two city markets is 300 yuan for the middle-class white japonica rice, but the off-site rice dealers' bid price has soared amazingly. The bidding price of japonica rice is extremely chaotic and it is still not easy to buy, which is more than double the sharp increase last Saturday.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour</p>
<p>There is no formal transaction, and the residual price off-site has seen a sharp rise again. The bidding price of No. 2 powder is 160 yuan, and there is also 180 yuan, which is more than double the mad rise, and the bran is 120 yuan, which is doubled.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The uniform surge, the less half a fold, and the more than a fold. Yellow soybeans were initially shouted at 300 yuan, and then Poyang Zidou was 250 yuan, corn and red grain rose by 50% or 60%. Sesame was rarely opened, milk sesame was 350, and Yangzhou raw kernel had reached 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The market transaction is stagnant, and the off-site bidding price is amazing. Soybean oil is 1,000 yuan, raw vegetable oil is 900 yuan, and the soybean office was first opened at 100 yuan, and then retreated to 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Sugar Soars</p>
<p>Edible sugar's off-site bidding price continued to soar yesterday, and the public's confidence was exceptionally strong. This street's absorption was not weak, and it was immediately absorbed when it was blamed. The transfer to other ports was particularly eager, and the bidding prices of the stalls repeatedly created new highs. No. 45 Che Baijing had a transaction of 430 yuan. The group sand supply was very scarce, and the bidding price was even higher. Xinghua Bai Xinghua Chi and others all stepped up.</p>
<h3>Importers and Exporters Association Requests Relaxation of Raw Material Import Quotas</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Association has raised opinions on the improvement of foreign exchange deposit payment methods and the relaxation of industrial raw material import quotas, requesting the relevant authorities to adopt and implement them. The following opinions are specifically put forward for (A) amending the foreign currency foreign exchange deposit payment method: 1. Production equipment in Appendix (1) and industrial raw materials in Appendix (2) should be allowed to be used by the original depositors in one lump sum. 2. The wheel-in in Appendix (2) is not limited to the number of limited frequency quantities. 3. Cancellation of the stipulation that the deposit can only be withdrawn after one price month of deposit. (B) Relaxation of the input quota: It is required to relax the quota of various industrial raw materials in Appendix (2) to increase production. (C) Resumption of the settlement certificate, so that the foreign exchange fixed price and the settlement certificate's market are integrated to approach the natural level, and for the sake of encouraging exports, the exporter should be allowed to easily purchase 80% of the export foreign exchange for input production equipment and industrial raw materials, so that both export promotion can be achieved and industrial products can be enriched, and the amount of the Golden Yuan Voucher issued will not increase. (D) Resumption of Loans: It is found that exporters often take months from the purchase of goods from the place of origin to the packaging and shipping, so the capital turnover is quite difficult. The government authorities have insight into their situation and have previously held export loans to facilitate the turnover of export funds. Since the implementation, it has been quite effective. To promote the promotion of exports, it is necessary to rely on the government to provide exporters with financial assistance, then export loans should be resumed as a matter of urgency, and the original export loan method should be restored to facilitate the export business.</p>

<p>Yifeng Farmland</p>
<p>The measurement has been completed, totaling about 1.4 million qiu, 623,1781 city mu. Due to the undulating terrain and vast area of the county, it is difficult to implement district collection and directly create self-cultivating farmers in the whole county, just like Ganzhou County. Moreover, due to the heavy workload, it is impossible to carry out it simultaneously in the shortest possible time with human and material resources. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the business in the future, the county decided to divide it into three phases, select wasteland in the villages, and delineate areas with more tenant land as demonstration areas for supporting self-cultivating farmers. The county plans to collect 200,000 mu of land and support 10,000 self-cultivating farmers. The phased handling of townships and towns and time have also been stipulated as follows: (1) The first phase, which will start in November 37, includes: Yanbu. Xuliang. Fengde. Xuanhua, Luxi. It will be completed in October 39. (2) The second phase, which will start in May 38, includes: Hetang·Xinmin·Tangpu. Tiande·Taiping·It will be completed in April 40. (3) The third phase, which will start in November 38, includes: Xinhui. Qingkai·Shuangku·Huanggang·It will be completed in October 40. The</p>
<p>organizational structure</p>
<p>of the demonstration area for supporting self-cultivating farmers is as follows: The county has one chief of the Land Administration Section, which is divided into four sections: land registration, land rights, land price, and land use, with four section chiefs, six staff members, four assistants, and four employees (according to the current establishment of the county government, the Land Administration Section has been tightened, with only one staff member and several assistants to deal with land administration affairs, and there are no full-time cadres in the townships). There are two technicians and assistants, and three business officers. Each township has one land administration cadre, and a liaison office is set up in the demonstration area of the decision-making self-cultivating farmers to deal with the business of the whole area, with one director, two section chiefs, four section members, two technicians and assistants, six business officers, and four employees. Ganzhou County has five liaison offices, and Yifeng has three.</p>
<p>The implementation of the work</p>
<p>measures is divided into 11 items, including land survey, demarcation of demonstration areas, assessment of land prices, declaration of industry and tenancy and land registration review, section collection, compensation of land prices, reorganization and improvement, division of unit farms, allocation and release, and guidance in handling B-type self-cultivating farmers.</p>
<p>Regarding the regulations for dividing unit farms, each unit farm is divided according to the reorganization and rectification results, or the original topography, according to the number of farmers, population, and arable land area in the demonstration area. Each farmer should contract one unit farm as the principle, and its area should be limited to 10 mu to 30 mu. The share</p>
<p>Release of Cultivated Land</p>
<p>There are more detailed regulations on the item: One: Farmers should contract land in the following order: (1) The original owner returns to self-cultivate (2) The original tenant farmer (3) The farmer who has been engaged in farming in the experimental area for three years (4) The farmer who has been engaged in farming in the county for three years The above three or four items out of the enlisted military family members have the priority to contract. One: Farmers who have the following circumstances shall not be allowed to contract land: (1) Those who have bad habits, (2) Those who have misconduct, (3) Those who have weak farming ability. 3: When allocating farms, it should be close to the residence of the cultivator, or the distribution of the original cultivated land, and its area should be the starting point for the pure income to maintain a family's life, but each household should not exceed the top-grade paddy field of 30 city mu at most. The area shall be determined by the demonstration area office according to the total area of cultivated land in the area, the fertility of the land, and the farming ability of each household. 4: The land price of the released land shall be based on the price of the collected land, and those who have implemented the reorganization or improvement may add the reorganization or improvement fee. The land price of the preceding item shall be prepared by the land-receiving farmers with 20% of the cash, and the remaining 80% shall be borrowed from the Agricultural Bank of China with the land price to be collected after the collection of land and the distribution of the release as collateral. The land-receiving people shall repay in installments every year. (The repayment period shall be in accordance with the loan regulations of the Agricultural Bank.) 5: After the land is collected and released, the original deed shall be cancelled, and the land-receiving person shall be issued a land-receiving certificate, and a release list shall be made to the registration authority for registration and to obtain a title deed, and the land-receiving certificate shall be recovered and a title deed shall be issued after the land-receiving person pays off the land price. 6: The released land is prohibited from being sublet or sold. If the contractor is unable to cultivate, the county shall recover it at the original price of the release and release it again.</p>

<h3>White Bear in Hong Kong Searched for Gasoline Trucks U.S. Merchants Took Countermeasures</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zi Jian</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 8th Air News] During the last World War, the Axis countries purchased a large number of military equipment and raw materials from the Allied countries through neutral Spain. This scene is now appearing again in a corner of the Far East! However, this time the purchase is the Soviet Union, not the Axis powers, and the location is not Spain, but Hong Kong!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union secretly absorbed military equipment and raw materials through Hong Kong as early as 1947. At that time, it only focused on tin ore and rubber, but since Washington announced the prohibition of military equipment exports to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union began to search for trucks and gasoline in Hong Kong. This activity has been particularly significant in the past two months.</p>
<p>With the development of this need, regular shipping has also started between North Korea and Hong Kong. A Soviet cargo ship named "Bierdaova" often travels back and forth, carrying ships of soybeans to Hong Kong, and carrying gasoline, trucks, wireless equipment, rubber, and tungsten ore back to Zhennanpu, North Korea. These transactions are handled by Chinese people, but the master behind the scenes is the "White Bear" of Siberia.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's reliable sources: U.S. gasoline companies in Hong Kong have now taken steps to prevent gasoline from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. It is said that unless satisfactory documents are presented, it is now not easy to purchase large quantities of gasoline in Hong Kong. A few days ago, a merchant suddenly searched for 50 "Dodge" trucks on the market. At that time, the "Boldava" happened to be sailing from North Korea to Hong Kong, and sensitive people saw a good omen.</p>
<p>I don't know why, when this "Boldava" sailed into the port of Lei Yue Mun, it collided with a British Blue Funnel Line cargo ship, almost burying itself in Kowloon Bay. Fortunately, it was able to sail to a shallow place with injuries and sink, with its bow stranded on the beach. However, more than half of the 2,500 tons of soybeans it carried were lost, estimated to be about 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars. ?</p>

<h3>"Public Opinion"?</h3>
<p>— Lightning</p>
<p>The death of Wang Huiteng, the famous opera singer, is said to have been due to "public opinion being a force to be feared." This can be seen in some of the lines from her will published in the newspapers. Her death inevitably reminds people of Ruan Lingyu, who also died twenty years ago from "public opinion being a force to be feared."</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the death of a "famous" woman—especially a suicide—is bound to cause a sensation. These days, Wang Huiteng's death is, of course, a topic for discussion and writing.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, if something happens to a "famous" woman, it is bound to cause a sensation; if the incident also involves a bit of a relationship between a man and a woman—even if it is just a little—the sensation will be even greater and more inevitable. In the previous period, wasn't Wang Huiteng the subject of discussion and writing?</p>
<p>The suicide of Ruan Lingyu twenty years ago and the suicide of Wang Huiteng this year, although the time distance is almost a quarter of a century, this point seems to be no different in China. The so-called "public opinion" still has a terrible power to kill. Therefore, "public opinion" forced Ruan Lingyu to death in those years, and it also forced Wang Huiteng to death today; it is like a jackal in a flock of lambs, a devil in a group of weaklings—</p>
<p>I think there is no need to use a seemingly "grand" formula for the death of a weak person—whether suicide or murder—such as "suicide is the behavior of the weak," or some kind of didactic tone like "…brought it upon themselves." Because this is neither "irreversible" for the "departed," nor necessarily "pursuable" for those who "come after." It is not only of no benefit to the living and the dead, but is also closer to being frivolous. A torrent of grand theories at most reveals a hypocritical, moralizing, and falsely compassionate ugly face!</p>
<p>Therefore, I am unwilling to elaborate on the question of whether Wang Huiteng deserved to die or not, whether she was weak or, on the contrary, strong. What I want to talk about is the so-called "public opinion" in "public opinion being a force to be feared."</p>
<p>"Public opinion" needs no explanation; everyone knows it is the words of "people." But even the single word "people" does not seem so simple. People are round-headed, square-footed animals, but round-headed and square-footed are only the physical form of people, and not necessarily the real people. Our Chinese interpretation of gods is: "intelligent and upright." Therefore, I also dare to make a comment on real "people": "distinguish right from wrong, know shame." Otherwise, the so-called "words" that only have the "human" form, to put it bluntly, are simply bestial noises from human heads!</p>
<p>But what about our "public opinion"? As long as it is a woman, as long as it is a woman with some reputation, once something unfortunate happens, then the so-called "public opinion" immediately rises like a storm: on the one hand, there is chattering, vivid storytelling; on the other hand, there is the use of "flowery prose," "anecdotes," and "romantic tales"... Saying and writing constitute the noisy form of "a hundred dogs barking," and this form immediately turns into a poisoned arrow, shooting straight into the heart of the weak. And so the weak have no choice but to die.</p>
<p>From the death of Ruan Lingyu to the death of Wang Huiteng, we are in such a society, such a country, such an era. Time has absolutely no effect on us. If you don't believe it, this is a fact.</p>
<p>"Public opinion" is needed by a progressive nation, but not the "public opinion" mentioned above. Because true "public opinion" should be the voice of true people. A true person should support the weak, have pity and sympathy for the unfortunate, guide the confused, strike at the violent, and point out the hypocritical. This is the behavior of a true person, the voice of a true person.</p>
<p>But what about our so-called "public opinion" now? It only knows how to flatter the strong, oppress the weak, ridicule the unfortunate, and play with the confused. After forcing the weak and unfortunate to death, it puts on a face of regret or preaching. What exactly is this?</p>
<p>Ruan Lingyu and Wang Huiteng, these two victims, were too honest and too naive. They were bitten by mad dogs but still treated them as humans, and they were still deluded until their death, saying things like "public opinion is a force to be feared." This is a disgrace to "public opinion." What is "public opinion"? Just "wuwu" sounds!</p>
<h3>A History of Shanghai Parks</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jian</p>
<p>The Bund Park was originally a mudflat in front of the British Consulate, which gradually rose due to the accumulation of sediment on the wreckage of a sunken ship. In the first year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1862), the Shanghai Sports Fund Board of Directors resolved to allocate 10,000 taels of silver to develop the area into a park. In the fourth year of Tongzhi, the Bureau of Works began construction, digging up soil from the Yangjingbang River and filling in the beach from Waibaidu Bridge to Beijing Road. On June 20th of the seventh year of Tongzhi (August 8th, 1868), the park was opened. Two months before the opening (in the fourth month of the intercalary year of the seventh year of Tongzhi), the British Consul Winchester wrote to the Shanghai Daotai, stating that the area had been filled by the Bureau of Works, totaling 30 mu, 4 fen, 7 li, and 3 hao, to be used as a public entertainment venue, and that no buildings would be constructed for profit. He requested approval for exemption from land tax; Shanghai Daotai Ying Bao Shi approved the request. However, the mudflat along the riverbank originally belonged to Chinese government land and should not have been freely disposed of by the Bureau of Works.</p>
<p>Hongkou Park: In the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign, the Bureau of Works purchased land outside the boundary of North Sichuan Road to build a shooting range. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), the park was expanded on this land, and designed and arranged by MacGregor, the Scottish superintendent of gardens for the Bureau of Works. Mr. MacGregor was an expert in horticulture and botany, and the scale of the Hongkou and Zhaofeng parks was all due to his management. Mr. MacGregor served in China for twenty-five years and returned to his home country in June of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>French Park: This area was originally purchased by the French for stationing troops when the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu. The following year, after the signing of the Boxer Protocol, the French army withdrew, and the area became desolate. In June of the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, the Board of Directors of the French Municipal Council began planning to develop the area into a park. In May of the first year of Xuantong (June 1909), the park was completed and opened in early July of the same year.</p>
<p>Zhaofeng Park: Part of the park was originally the site of the Zhaofeng Garden. In the third year of Xuantong, the owner of the Zhaofeng Garden, E.J. Hogg, sold the garden. St. John's University purchased part of it for 140,000 taels, while the southern end of Jessfield Road was purchased by the Bureau of Works. Later, the Bureau of Works expanded the original site to 300 mu. On March 20th of the third year of the Republic of China, the Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting resolved to arrange the area as a public scenic garden and botanical garden center, and the entire plan was handed over to the garden superintendent, Mr. MacGregor, for design. As a result, the beauty of Zhaofeng Park was unparalleled in the city, and its horticulture was especially praised at the time.</p>
<p>The parks opened by the Bureau of Works and the French Municipal Council mentioned above, although within our country, have always been forbidden to our Chinese people. This is one aspect of the discrimination against Chinese people during the concession period. Negotiations for opening began in the eleventh year of Guangxu, requesting the opening of the Bund Park, but the Bureau of Works ignored it. In the summer of the fifteenth year of Guangxu, as a result of negotiations between the Shanghai Daoxian and the British Consul, the Bureau of Works only agreed to issue permits, but each permit was only valid for one week, and the number was extremely small. In the second year of Xuantong, the City Self-Government Office proposed negotiations again, but it was not until the seventeenth year of the Republic of China that the Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting passed the park opening proposal. From July 1st of that year, all parks were opened to Chinese people, and at the same time, a ticket system was implemented. The annual ticket cost one yuan, and the entrance ticket cost ten copper coins.</p>
<h3>Diligence and Self-Help</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Today I received twelve gold yuan from the accounting department. This is the price I got for a month of diligence and self-help. Looking at these few dollars in my hand, I have endless thoughts.</p>
<p>Let me first explain the meaning of diligence and self-help. This is a kind of work-study experiment. The school helps ordinary poor students and students who come to Shanghai from the war zone, because after they pay a large amount of tuition, miscellaneous fees, board and lodging, they are really short of pocket money for this semester, including buying books, getting haircuts, and transportation expenses. Therefore, the school authorities considered this difficulty and set aside a part of the tuition income as funding for running diligence and self-help programs. Students are assigned to various departments to assist in work according to their specialties. Such a kind of after-school "occupation" can accumulate thirty or forty hours per month. The remuneration is calculated at thirty cents per gold yuan per hour this year, and it is also about ten yuan. Of course, these money may not be worth a look in the eyes of students who spend tens of gold at once, but for poor students, it is always a small supplement!</p>
<p>I once saw a similar record in a magazine: in American universities, they also have this kind of self-help work. One boy was assigned to clean the girls' dormitory. The first day, the girl paid him a dime; unexpectedly, the waitress who served him at dinner was the one who gave him the money during the day. So, after the meal, he put the dime he earned back on the plate as a small payment, and the female classmate accepted it with a smile. Although this is a coincidence, it can be seen that the promotion of this system abroad is already quite common.</p>
<p>However, I feel that it seems that there are some difficulties in implementing it in China for the first time, that is, the psychology of being afraid of embarrassment, really because the environment is too luxurious, and many classmates will laugh at it as low-status work. In fact, as long as we are not too inferior, I think it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It was in this mood that I worked in the post and telecommunications office for a month. At the same time, in addition to the royalties I usually get from writing, this is still my first time earning money. I cherish every dollar, I want to use it well, because it represents the harvest of several hours of work!</p>
<h3>Lines from the Depths of the Clouds</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Sending Thoughts to Shen Shoudong in Little Qingpu</p>
<p>The city connects to fragrant grass, close in sight, the air enters the high autumn, beautifully purple; the stream water is clear and should see the bottom, the traces of chanting going south are likely to become real (hearing that there will be a trip to Songjiang); the wild Xianghua Bridge recalls the previous visit, the Huilao residence deep, recounting old kinship (Yu Huishu), the ancients had the example of poor poets, only the poetry scrolls remain, unable to be poor.</p>
<p>Drinking at Longtou Isle, the wine family resembles Ji Liang, Shi Shen Xuanchang, Deng Sanmu, and also sending to Shi Shufan at sea</p>
<p>Under the cup, the rivers and mountains are resting from the fires of war, regretting the incomplete hegemonic plans! Ten thousand measures of fine wine must be priceless, a consistent strange feeling is believed to be untiring; why does Shao Wen pity Jiang Guan, turning to laugh at the fish and dragons in many difficulties! For several years, I have left a crazy state in the lakes and seas, after the misty rain, there are old traces on my head.</p>
