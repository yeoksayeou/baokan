<p>王外長在國務會報吿</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕外交部長王世杰廿七日在國務會中報吿外交時，其中會報吿本年二月間遠東委會所通過對日軍事之禁止一案，該案內容包括禁止日本軍事活動及處置日本軍事設備兩部份，已沒收日武器，僅警察可佩用短槍及獵槍外，餘均不可使用。對日本軍事設備之處置部份，則規定所有學校之軍事敎育一律取消，已改爲輪船之軍船，不得再行更改爲軍艦使用。</p>
<h3>美檢討遠東政策　派政略家凱寗赴日調查　並將研究我國北方局勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國刻正重新檢討其遠東政策，並已派遣國務院政策委會主席凱寧赴日本，擔任研究該區情勢之特別職務。馬歇爾今宣布，凱氏已啓程赴日，調査日本之　勢及與麥帥有所會商。馬卿雖未透露凱氏之行程爲何，但據美官方人士告中央社記者稱，國務院政策委員會主席（按即指凱寧）此次赴遠東時，並將硏究華北之情勢，及朝鮮之共產黨問題，但馬　則僅承認凱寧之任務與未來對日和約問題有關，並謂，渠不知凱氏是否將訪問中國及其在日本將勾留多久。凱氏計劃於返國時取道菲律賓。記者訽以凱氏之任務是否與美國最近一所宣布擬協助日本之經濟恢復自給自足基礎之政策有關，馬卿答稱，凱氏勾留日本期間，將硏究該項特別問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛領廿六日合衆電〕美高級官方人士吿合衆社記者稱，馬歇爾於派　其外交政策高等顧問凱寗至日本一事上所表現之行動，乃係美國意欲劇烈改變其對日政策，以及儘力建設日本　一堡壘，以阻止蘇聯在遠東擴張之先聲。據稱，美國已決定放棄其在波茨坦會議中所持主張處罰日本之立塲，而現則力謀恢復日本之經濟繁榮，俾使其能成爲在亞洲抵制共產主義之堡壘。麥帥早已持有此種見解。據稱，除此種基本理由外，僉望凱寗此行將可平息若干人士對美政府在其顧慮歐洲情况下而致忽視遠東一節所作之評論。派遣凱寗赴日之決定，係於上週之政策會議中獲致者。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿七日電〕合衆社廿七日自權威方而獲悉，中國對日本之一般態度，特別是在對日和會問題，業已發生激烈之改變，幾已與美國政策全相同。按中國政府於去年四月間所宣布之立塲，與蘇聯之態度相同。當時政府宣稱，如蘇聯不出席和會，中國亦不擬參加。現時中國新態度，則與前時之立塲恰成强烈對照。策動此次轉變者，爲「慢而穩」之王世杰外交部長，而所以有此轉向者，蓋以共產黨對中國及世界之戍脅日益增强。</p>

<h3>從捷克政變說起</h3>
<p>捷克的政潮，經過幾天的醞釀，信仰自由民主走着中間偏左路綫的貝奈斯總統，終於敵不住外來的壓力及內在的威脅，接受人民社會黨，人民黨，以及斯洛伐克民主黨閣員的辭呈，而批准高德華內閣總理所提出的共砟黨內閣名單。新閣雖然依舊保持着「聯合政府」的外貌，但是政權完全被握在捷克共產黨的手裏，而且新閣業已宣佈，全國每一公共機關都要實行整肅運動，淸除反對政府的份子。所以捷克內閣這一次的改組，不僅是捷克內政上的變動，其影響所及，且足以牽動世界大局。其意義的重大。實在不容我們忽視。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於捷克共產黨取得政權，洋洋得意，自不待言。誠如莫斯科電台英語評論員高夫曼所說：「捷克人民已表現高度的政治活動，反動派顯然料不到羣衆的團結會如此堅强。」此語可以代表蘇聯方面的觀感。但是在另一方面，英美法三國却發表了一個聯合宣言，譴責捷克共產奪取政權，「在聯合政府的名義下建立起一個一黨專政的掩飾獨裁制，對於捷克人民唯有釀成重大的災禍」，所以這一次的政潮，賓在「危害爲一切民主國家所愛護的自由原則之存在。「美國或將進一步，對捷克共產政權，採取經濟制裁。據美國高級官員談稱，可能採取四項辦法：（一）由美國進出口銀行取消二千萬美元棉貸畀予捷克之計劃；（二）由財政部凍結捷克政府在美所有資產：（三）由世界復興銀行的美國代表反對捷克前所提出的復興貸款；（四）由國際貨幣基金的美國代表反對捷克申請貸款。由此可知，捷克政潮現雖吿一段落，但其後果，足以引起國際政治上的軒然大波。</p>
<p>捷克這一個國家，是在第一次世界大戰後應運而生的。但她在地理上，適居於歐洲的中心。人人都曉得，「誰能控制捷克，誰就能控制歐陸」的道理。所以納粹德國要想向外發展，就非侵犯捷克不可；慕尼黑的一幕，就是一個絕好的瞪明。同時，捷克還有一個先天的缺點，就是捷克是由兩種不同的民族組成的，互相齟齬，無有已時，故人民在思想上雖然傾向民主，國內工業化雖然也優於其他鄰國，但捷克似乎命定的終歸於失敗。第一次大戰前，捷克卽淪爲納粹德國的附庸：到第二次大戰結束時，貝奈斯總統飴能重建捷克，在他面前又復浮境出一個美麗的幻想，似乎可以領導捷克走向民主·社會·獨立的道路。但是二年半以來，貝奈斯總統有錯綜複雜的國際政治圈內，又陷於苦悶的深淵。他爲捷克本身的需要打算，一方面需要東方的原料與動力，另一方面又需要西方的資金與機械，而來自東西兩面的政治陰影，却在威脅他所走的中間路綫。他雖然渴望美國的物質援助，但終無坦然接受：他雖恐懼蘇聯勢力的滲入，但終於無力抗拒！到現在，政綫發生，中間路綫已經山窮水盡，這一位被視爲捷克民族的最高領袖貝奈斯總統，不久也將宣吿下野了！走中間路綫者得　下塲，眞是捷克民主的悲劇，也是世界和平前途的打擊。捷克共產黨的作風是如此，世界任何一國共黨的作風也是如此。從捷克的悲劇可以獲得一敎訓，就是與共黨合作與共存的想法，都是不可能的；一不小心，就要遭到捷克民主的悲劇！</p>
<p>捷克這次政潮的發生，不僅是捷克各黨之間的攤牌，而且　將逼得西方民主國家不久大家來攤牌。爲了使讀者容易明瞭起見，不得不從馬歇爾國務卿提出援歐計劃說起。</p>
<p>馬歇爾援歐計劃的目的，無非以美國龐大的財力與物力，援助歐洲各國經復興，使其不致陷於紛亂的狀態，而爲極權主義者所支配。平心而論，馬歇爾的動機是善良的正當的，本可博得世界各國的廣大同情。但是美國援歐計劃，還在爭辨不休之際，却引起了蘇聯無限的憂懼與反感。東歐新共產國際的出現，巴爾幹集團的組成，以及德國東部經濟機構的加强，乃至這次捷克的政變，都是一連串由蘇聯幕後導演的戲劇。我們在上面已經說過，捷克是需要而且是渴望美國物質援助的，但是一經外來的壓迫，捷克就聲明退出，由經國內共產黨的威脅，捷克竟就完全投入東歐集團的懷裏去了。這不能不說是捷克的一大轉變，美國援歐計劃的一大阻力。</p>
<p>從捷克政變說來，蘇聯所領　的反對馬歇爾訐劃運動，不論在時間上或在效率方面，均已經着着佔先。再回過頭來，看看美國，馬歇爾計劃尙在國會辯論的階段，總數幾何？何時實行？均在未知之數。美國受了這一次的警吿，或者會加强馬歇爾計劃的實施，促成西歐國家經濟的團結。但是無論如何，美國在對蘇外交戰上，終小免有處處落後之威。杜魯門主義與馬歇爾計劃雖均以反共爲口號，但在行動上，不是失之遲緩，就是不能澈底。杜魯門主義不僅尙未推行及遠東，卽在歐洲也未貫澈；捷克已向美國發出警吿，美國朝野豈可一誤再誤？對於各國共黨的猖獗，豈可再袖手旁觀，任其蔓延？美國申行檢討其外交政策，這是時侯了。</p>

<h3>擴展共產勢力漫無止境　蘇對芬蘭施高壓　建議締結友好互助條約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：芬蘭京城訊，今日芬蘭總統柏西基維接到史達林之戴要函件，其中建議蘇芬簽訂友好互助條約。總統於今日下午在總統府召集各黨派領袖舉行會議，商討對策。政治消息靈通方面認爲蘇聯主張與芬蘭簽訂軍事同盟，但除共產黨外，其他政黨恐不覆予以接受。衆料芬總統將設法限制協定之範圍，使其性質成為聯合抵抗任何可能之德國侵略。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿七日廣播：華盛頓訊，國務院專家預測蘇聯爲「鞏固」東默而探取之步驟，將爲以若干附庸國併入蘇聯。此項行動，或須在若干國家（如捷克）春季舉行選舉以及芬蘭完全落入共產然控制之後。此外，法義兩國，在本年春季中，亦將爲共產黨活動之主要目標。</p>
<p>〔聯合社芬蘭京城廿七日電〕外交部今日宣稱：芬蘭已接蘇聯政府要求締結蘇芬條約之建議，但條約性質究係友好或互助，再或兩者兼具，現尙未悉。自捷克共產黨政變成功以來，此間謠隊甚熾，盛傳蘇聯與芬蘭兩國政府要員正在進行有關「兩國邦交新發展」之談判。外交部並稱，總統昨接蘇聯某要員親筆函，其中說明蘇方之新計劃。另據外交界消息靈通人士稱，總統昨日曾在官邸召集外部官員舉仃會議，旋又延見政府其他官員，國會議長亦於傍晚晋謁總統有所晤商，均係討諭此事。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿六日電〕希特勒統治下之德國，在戰前向外擴張勢力，拌制鄰國十餘萬方哩之土地，二千八百萬以上之人民。蘇聯及共黨政府自二次世界大戰以來，亦已在歟洲及東方擴展二十餘萬方哩，勢力及於一億一千萬人民。共黨勢力所及已遠過於沙皇時代。捷克爲最近陷入共黨陣營之國家，但或非最後一個。克萊姆林宮對於希土義法芬蘭以及東德與奧地利，亦頗注意。迄今二十萬方哩以上之土地，二千四百萬以上之人民，已於戰時及戰後倂入蘇聯，憂沙尼亞，立陶宛於一九四〇年首被吸收，波蘭戰前領土五分之二，芬羅及德捷之一部份領土，亦爲蘇聯所佔，日本之千島列島南庫頁島亦已併人蘇聯應圍。自德日投降而後，共產勢力之西進益速，南，阿，波，保，羅，匈等國，先後爲共黨所控制，今又繼之以捷克，以上諸國之而積達四十四萬方哩，人口總計約八千七百萬人。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾要求國會撥疑　對希土再予援助　需二億七千五百萬美元</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日致函衆院議長馬丁與參院議長范登堡，代表杜魯門總統提出法案，要求增撥二億七千五百萬元，在軍事上援助希臘與土耳其。國會去年五月曾通過四億元援助希土法案，該款已近用罄，如不另行撥款，美國對於該雨國之援助將於本年六月底結束，新法案若獲批准，則可繼續供給槍砲彈藥至明年六月底爲止。馬卿並稱，美國如果停止援助，極權主義集團勢將乘隙接收該兩國政權。余認爲援助此等自由民族保持其自由，無疑出於本國自身利益，且與聯合國憲章原則符合。土耳其現正經常遭受壓力，迫其將韃戰尼爾海峽軍事基地與一部份領土讓予某國。至於歐洲其他各國則已切實增加其糧食煤斤與鋼鐵產量，必能在援歐復興計劃下實行自助。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕某權威人士頃評論捷克政變稱，「此與二次大戰前奧地利與捷克之變局如出一轍，其不同老前次爲納粹自外侵入，此次係假手捷共而已。」渠認捷克政權之爲共黨攫去，乃東歐戰幕之彌合。蓋捷克工業發達，人民生活永準頗高，民主自由之風極盛，於赤色鎖鍊下撑持已逾兩年，今仍不免在武力下屈服，洵爲莫大悲劇。渠並預言捷總統貝奈斯及外長馬蕯里克之留任，爲捷共之一手段，貝蕯兩氏遲早亦必被逐出政府。倘西歐國家對此民主政治之慘敗，無有效挽救之策，野心家之次一目標，將　義大利，而曾為墨索里尼散佈獨裁種子之義大利，實較捷克更為脆弱。渠結論謂，「今日世界大局，無論東方西方，民主主義又已遭逢一嚴重之考慮，提高警覺乃挽回頽局之必要條件。」記者訽以美國經濟力量包括援外計劃，是否可望有助於挽回頽局。渠稱，「此不失爲辦法之一部份，然時機已急迫萬分。」</p>

<h3>小型大會通過決議案　南韓決進行選舉　朝鮮委會準備返韓工作</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國小型大會頃以卅一票對兩票，棄權者十一票，通過美國所提在南韓舉行選舉之決議案，投反對票者爲澳洲及加拿大，棄權者委內瑞拉，瑞典，挪威及埃及。美國於本週初建議應不顧蘇聯之反對，立即舉行選舉以成立朝鮮國民政府，同時設立立法機構以準備北韓人民代表可能的參加。澳代表哈雷表示，渠認聯大通過之決議案，並未授權朝鮮委員會舉行全國選舉，小型大會亦不應處理此事。</p>
<p>哈雷復曰：澳代表團並預見可能發生另一危險，即南韓北韓可能產生對立的當局，同時以韓國人民之代表自居，南韓若成立國民政府，聯合國殊不能忽視該政府可將遭受的威脅。澳代表團主張舉行僅具咨詢作用的選舉，使當選的韓人代表，得與聯合國委員會及聯合國大會交換舉行國民選舉的意見，然後再決定舉行選舉之事，瑞典代表哈格洛夫表示瑞典意見與挪威相同，認爲有召開聯大特別會或五强咨詢會之必要，渠認朝鮮問題的答案，乃在妥協及談判，聯合國採用此種方法，可望較其他方法能有獲得具體結果的更多機會。埃及代表福齊，對聯合國朝鮮委會，能否在南韓舉行國民選舉，或此等選舉是否眞正有助於朝鮮之統一等兩點，表示懷疑，故埃及未便一又持美國之建議案。</p>

<p>〔是可忍孰不可忍〕的辦法</p>
<p>當蘇聯軍隊於一九四四年四月間開始進入羅馬尼亞的時候，蘇聯和巴爾幹各國的關係，開始在我們的外交上佔據顯要的地位。</p>
<p>許多國家的報紙中紛紛猜測，就是蘇聯的目的究竟是解放還是屬有。一九四四年五月三十日，英大使哈里法克斯突然問我，假如英國和蘇聯擬定一種辦法，使蘇聯在羅馬尼亞可以有控制勢力，而英國則在希臘可以有控制勢力，我國的感覺將屬如何。</p>
<p>他把他政府的一個書面文件交給我，其中詢問假如英國和蘇聯成立協議，因而在大體上羅馬尼亞的事務將由蘇聯政府還管，希臘的事務將由聯合王國照管，我們是否有所反對。英蘇這種諒解，祗適用於戰爭的情形之下，並不影響三大國中任何一國在和平解決時必須運用的權利和責任。</p>
<p>英國外交部說，聯合王國政府深知將巴爾幹各國劃成勢力範圍一點，應該力予避免，縱使是這樣印象，也應該予以防止。</p>
<p>在我告訴哈里法克斯說我對於這一點，將予以愼重考慮之後，就直率地說道：</p>
<p>驟觀之，鑒於首先是一個政府繼而是另一個政府互相指責干涉巴爾幹各國和歐洲其他國家經濟，政治，軍事和其他內政事務，而這種責難在將來也一定會不斷發生，所以放棄我們廣泛基本宣言中的政策，原則，和辦法，是殊可疑慮的。假如在一兩重要方面異亂了原來的主張，猶如你所建議的，那麼與此一行動有關的兩個國家中的任何一個，就將沒有先例或者任何固定的規則可循，或者堅持別國政府必須遵循的先例或者規則了。</p>
<p>事實上，我是直率反對歐洲任何部份劃分爲勢力範圍的。我在莫斯科會議中曾力予反對，在我看來，任何勢力地帶的成立，勢必播下將來衝突的種子。我覺得勢力地帶勢必剝削國際安全機構的最高權力，而這個機構，我是預料它會產生的。</p>
<p>用均勢或勢力範圍來維持和平觀念，我已往旣不相信，現在也不相信。</p>
<p>翌日，五月三十一日，邱吉爾首相直接打電報給總統，力主我們贊成建議中的協定。哈里法克斯無疑已把我的意見用電報通知他。他申言英國並不想把巴爾幹各國劃成勢力地區，這種辦法，僅適用於戰時情形，而美國和英國政府在訂定和實施盟國對希臘和羅馬尼亞的政策方而，將繼續現行合作，並無變更。</p>
<p>他的電報多提供兩項消息，其一是這個協定是由英國政府向蘇聯駐倫敦大使哥塞夫提出的。其二是蘇方於五月十八日通知英方，說明他們是同意這個建議的，但在他們能够給予最後的保證之前，希望知道是否已曾和美國政府商量渦，以及我們是否同意這個辦法。</p>
<p>羅斯福把電報送給我考慮，並且要我起草一個答覆。</p>
<p>國務院中的同事，對於我原來對哈里法克斯所取的態度，表示同意，那就是說我們不能支特諸如此類的協定，事實上，我們應該儘量加以抑制。</p>
<p>當這個答覆正在國務院中準備之際，另一個電報又於六月八日從首相那裏來了。他重新說明此中並無勢力範圍的問題牽涉在內。似是他又說，雖然我們必須一起行動，可是總要有人動手。在他看來，蘇聯人似乎應該去處理羅馬尼亞人和保加利亞人，英國似乎應該處理希臘人，因爲希臘是在英國的作戰範圍之內，是英國的舊盟邦，爲了希臘，英國並曾於一九四一年犧牲過四萬人。他還說這對於南斯拉夫，也是準確的。</p>
<p>邱吉爾先生表示意見　，他一直設法把各種情形不騷通知他，但是英國是在處理希臘的事務，必須極審愼地行動，藉使蘇聯可表同意。他指出巴爾幹方面的事態，是在極快地演進中。</p>
<p>他說英國在南美洲方面總是儘量追隨美國的領導的，祇要不牽涉到她自己的飯食問題就可以了。至於有關她自己的切身問題，那麼爲了「子女』關係，當然是要採取堅强的立塲的。</p>
<p>這個電報有一點頗關重要，因爲其中提出了英方至今未曾提出過的兩個國家—就是保加利亞由蘇聯處理，南斯拉夫由英國處理。所以反對這種辦法，現在似乎比以前任何時間來得更迫切了，因爲如此做去，將使一批國家置於蘇聯之下，另一批國家置於英國之下。</p>
<p>六月十日，總統把我們的答覆送給首相。總統在答覆中承認在任何國家中負責軍事行動的政府—英國在軍事上對希臘負責，蘇聯對羅馬尼亞負責—爲了軍事發展上的需要，有時不得不有所決定。但是我們相信，由於英方所建議的協定，將使這種決定擴充到政治經濟領城去的自然傾向，勢將予以加强。總統表示意見說，這種傾向一定會引起英蘇之間不斷發生異見並使巴爾幹各國劃分爲勢力範圍，雖然邱吉爾說這個協定是限於軍事方面的。　總統最後說，我們希望能爲巴爾幹設立一個諮詢機構來消除誤解，並且防止各自爲政的勢力地帶，不斷發展。</p>
<p>首相於翌日—六月十一日—發來一個强有力的覆電，聲稱總統的電文使他非常担心。他說，假如在採取行動之前每一個人必須和另外的每一個人商量，行動將被麻痹了。巴爾幹方面事態的發展，常常比一般局勢的變化來得更迪切。</p>
<p>邱吉爾先生提出了兩個例證，當時他所採取的直接行動解決了局勢—那就是希臘軍隊在伊斯德的叛變以及在埃及境內可能發生的困難。假如英國必須和其他國家商量，三四個國家必須互相通電，結果可能造成混亂和陷於無法處理了。</p>
<p>他表示意見說，在希臘危機中，總統給他的電報曾發生驚人的效果。他和總統的意見完全一致，結果完全滿意。他詢問爲什麼這一切有效的指導應該分散給一個委員會中的低能的官吏，這一類官吏刻正分散在世界各地。他還詢問爲什慶他和總統不能把這種指導掌握在他們自己的手中，因爲他們對於一切的　　較親切得多。</p>
<p>首相最後建議將他所提出的辦法試辯三個月，之後，再由三强加以檢討。</p>
<p>當這個電報到達之時，我正在宣傳佛尼亞州的漢希休息幾天。總統並未和我或者國務院商量，在次日加以答覆，接受了首相所提試辦三個月的建議，但是說明一切必須謹愼從事，俾能明白表示並不是在建立戰後　勢力範圍。</p>
<p>總統並沒有把此一行動通知國務院。</p>
<p>我就在那時候回到了華盛頓。在我回來的那天—六月十二日，因爲不知道總統致首相的電報，我們把總統先前所核准的一個備忘錄送給英國大使館，其中我們列舉了反對建議中的英蘇協定的論據。</p>
<p>六月十七日，我還是不知道總統於六月十二目致首相的電報，於是就寫給首相一封信，其中指出邱吉爾光生把他的建議，公開地適用於整個巴爾幹區，因爲除了羅馬尼亞和希臘之外，還提出了保加利亞和南斯拉夫，並指出他提出了我們在南美洲的地位作爲一種比喩</p>
<p>我說，「邱吉爾先生雖就英國的立塲再度予以說明，但是並不能克服我們的反對，或者似乎使我們對這個危險的建議，改變見解。」</p>
<p>我並就我認爲是「該一事件的極令人困惑方面」，促使其注意——那就是英方並沒有和我們討論此一性質的建議，直至向蘇万提出而在後者詢問事前曾否和我們商量之後。</p>
<p>英國外交部曾說明整個建議是發生於艾登向哥塞夫大使偶然的一句說話，而邱吉爾先生在五月三十一日這個坦白的電報中却明白說明英國曾向蘇聯大使表示英蘇對於羅馬尼亞和希臘，應該自己獲致協議。我說，「首相的電報，顯示我國政府將而臨英蘇之間一個業已成立的勢力範圍的協定，假如蘇方一下子就表示同意而並不提出我國立塲問題的話。」</p>
<p>六月二十八日，我國駐希大使麥克維（Lincoln　MacVeagh）發來的一個電報引起了我們的注意（駐希大使館當時設在開羅），其中吿訴我們說，他的英國同事曾經通知他一點，就是美國政府已經同意這個建議，惟規定在三個月之後應再予檢討。這是我們對於總統六月十二日的決定所獲的第一個暗示。</p>
<p>我寫了一封信給總統，於次日送給他，其中附有麥克維大使的電報內容，並且問他我們的立塲是否已經有所改變。</p>
<p>總統在六月三十日作覆，其中祇附了他和邱吉爾先生所交換的電訊中的幾節或摘要。</p>
<p>其中包括由國務院起草而由我於六月十七日送給總統準備發給邱吉爾先生的電報。這個電報是由總統於六月二十二日發給首相的，其中他說他對於巴爾幹的局勢　　有些担心，國務院也是如此。他說英國僅在向蘇方提出此項建議而於後者訽問我們是否贊同之後，方始向我們提出此一問題，此點的確使我們冰到相當困惑的。他說今後他希望能够防止如此重要的事情循這種路綫發展。</p>
<p>首相於翌日——六月二十三日——答覆說，他不承認他做錯了什麼事情。他指出三國人民分散在世界的不同部份，假如一國人民向另一國人民提出任何建議必須通知第三方面的話，就無法一起有效工作。他舉出了一個例子，就是總統就他和渡蘭總理米柯拉傑克所作的談話，發給U.J.一個電報，事前並未通知邱吉爾。（總統和首相有時用Uncle　Joe的縮寫U.J.來指史達林的。）</p>
<p>羅斯福先生就此點於六月二十六日提出答覆說，在他看來，他們大家都在無意中採取了單獨的行動，而現在他們都同意這是出於當時時緊急的需要。他力言他們對於有關盟國作戰努力的各項問題，應該一直保持一致。他於是把就他和米柯拉傑克的談話發給史達林的電報的一個複本，送給邱吉爾先生。</p>
<p>以後的事態，充份地證實了我們對英蘇這種辦法所有的恐懼心理，後者在總統認可之下，已經發生效力。當邱吉爾首相和艾登於一九四四年十月赴莫斯科去會晤史達林和莫洛托夫的時候，他們把這種辦法更推進了一步，甚至規定了英蘇在巴爾幹各國中所佔勢力的百分率。從我國駐莫斯科和安卡拉來的電報，提起蘇聯在保加利亞，匈牙利和羅馬尼亞佔有七十五比二十五或者八十比二十的優勢，而英蘇在南斯拉夫則將以五十比五十平分秋色。後來蘇聯人信以爲根據一九四四年六月的協定英美已把巴爾幹的一部份，包括羅馬尼亞和保加利亞在內，作爲他們的勢力範圍。這個假定，在一九四五年二月間的雅爾達會議中，曾產生不良的影響。</p>

<h3>訪中比鐵道公司　繁榮的比利時</h3>
<p>— 第三信　本報特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>〔本報布魯塞爾十七日航訊〕在布魯塞爾的逗留期中我在比國外交部遇見了『中國通』王克勳總領事。這位三十多年居住在中國的比利時外交官，他知道中國的民情，風俗，以及社會習慣。他的原名似乎應該念作『文寇會』，王克動三個字，是他的一位中國朋友給他取的。他從一九二年，武昌起義那一年就到達中國，做過駐天津，漢口，哈爾濱的領事，最後十年在上海做總領事，去年才奉調回部，比國外交部的大大小小職員，都仍然稱他『總領事』，他是相當被大衆歡迎的一個。</p>
<p>我問『籠領事』想不想再回中國去？他說：最好有機會回中國辦實業。我以爲這句話不僅是王克勳個人講的，他是代表着比國大大小小的實業界的共同意見。比利時工程師，比利時的資本，曾經替我們造過平漢鐵，隴海鐵路，秦皇島的耀華玻璃廠，乃至於參加漢冶萍公司的開創，滿渮晚年，我們的前一輩時代，透過那時候提倡『洋務』的張之洞盛宣懷這一輩之手，我們相當的利用過比利時的『外資』，而且並沒有因爲比利時的外資，引起任何中比之間的政治糾紛。</p>
<p>實業投資</p>
<p>有位居留在比國相當年份的中國人說：比利時在十九世紀末，利奧波特皇帝二世時代，未始沒有對中國有所調『野心』，利奧彼特皇帝二世，特地把李鴻章請到比京來，優禮有加。那時候的比國政府，也似乎有過那麼一些想法，八國聯軍之役中國並沒有被瓜分，接着又是辛亥革命，第一次歐洲大戰，比利時對中國，是再也沒有什麼『政治野心』了。那位朋友的結論講得些巧妙：今天我們如果和比利時談經濟合作，祇要談得成，我們總不會上當！</p>
<p>怎樣才能談得成？我以一個新聞記者的資格，和王克勳總領事隨便講起。他說：國家的借款，要透過外交上的正式『接頭』，而戰後兩年來，中國政府祗有問美國借錢。從來沒向比國提起過。『當然』，他說：『目前比國還沒有能力放外價，但是實業上的投資，譬如辦工廠，尤其造鐵路，比國是有這份興趣和這份能力的』！</p>
<p>總裁約都</p>
<p>我感謝　純伯代辦　我介紹『中比鐵道公司』的總裁約都（Jadot）先生，一位七十五歲高齡的老實業家，約都先生的全名呌裘列斯。約都，他哥哥琪思。約都（Jean　Jadot），是當年建造平漢鐵路的總工程師，裘列斯。約都，也曾經長時期居住中國，回比國後，即任中比鐵道公司的總裁。去年十月，公司的名稱改爲：『遠束鐵道公司』，但實際上仍然祗以中國爲業務的對象。總公司的英文秘畫高地葉說得好…『我們的公司，營然對象仍然祇有中國，因此，我們完全贊同多多對中國投資，因爲這是我們的職業和飯碗』！</p>
<p>秘書穆勒</p>
<p>我到布魯塞爾的斯擺街三十二號約都先生的公館訪問，這位七十五歲高齡的『中國之友』，正臥病牀上，我代表申報，送給他一束鮮花。第二犬，我在實業大街的公司辦公室，會見公司的主任秘書穆勒，全都業務的最主要負責人，一個精明能幹的老者。他吿訴我：平漢鐵路是他們公司造的，辛亥革命前三年，一九〇八年，滿淸政府備款購買，牧歸中國國有，如今隴海鐵路的殺票，仍然在公司掌握之中，因爲中國戰崗，隴海的般票賣不起錢，公司完全把他對存起來；不在證券交易市塲買賣。穆勒先生並沒有提到隴海路的盈虧情况，他祇說：一九三七年以前，公司有一筆機車，和鐵路器材，送往平漢。隴海兩條鐵道，這筆撥款中國方面並沒有淸償。</p>
<p>興築鐵道</p>
<p>我吿訴他：目前中國雖有亂事，但華南和西南各省，十分平靖，很合於投資的對象，『遠東鐵道公司』有沒有計劃再投資在中國興修若干新鐵道？他非常感覺興趣，他說：去年凌鴻勛先生來比利時，一度談起渦在華南興築鐵道的事，後來並沒聽見中國方面具體的計劃，中比外交方面，也沒正式談起過。他還說：按照公司對外投資的原則，必須要先有比國政府和比國國家銀行的担保。比國政府如何肯祖保？完全要靠中比兩國政府的外交正式談判，他說：比國方面非常有這層意思，問題是要中國政府先提出？此外，他又說到：『第二個問題是將來鐵道建成以後的付款，過去中國付款一概經渦英格蘭銀行，根據英鎊爲基準，將來希望要改美金爲基準』。</p>
<p>找尋主顧</p>
<p>穆勒先生還說到：遠東鐵道公司在上海有一個辦事處，設在九江路一百五十號三〇七號房間，『那邊的辦事處主任雷納德先生，是一位幹練精明的脚色』。他還順便吿訴我：上個月，雷納德先生從上海飛往廣州看宋十文主席。我問他是不是有關對華南鐵道投資的談判？他笑起來：『當然　，中國需要鐵道建設」！</p>
<p>我部他們比國的鋼鐵生產，和鐵路器材生產的情形，英文秘書高地葉先生回答我：比國的重工業生產，不但已經恢復到戰前的水準，而且有很多部門，遠超過戰前，『譬如鐵軌，目前新的成品，堆積如山，主要的是找尋主顧，找尋能付給Cash的主顧』!</p>
<p>王總領事</p>
<p>這就是王克動總領事和我講的『法比兩國，不可同日而語』的話，那天，王克勳總領事剛從巴黎回來比京，他看見成萬的法國羣衆，要求國會否決『廢止五千法郞大票』的政府提案，在國會門外請願。王克勳總領事把兩手一伸一伸的說：『幸虧我們比間不是道綴，比國很少共產寫，很少罷工，所以我們恢復得較快』！</p>
<p>我因爲時問太倉促，沒有含到比國全國鐵道公司的副總戰依梯先生，瞿純伯代辦的熟期友，依梯先生的秘書把我帶到各部門參觀，那是一個幾千職員的一個大企業機構，我從樓上穿到樓下，又從樓下坐電梯昇到樓上，那種大企業的塲面，證明比利時鐵道事業的堅强有力。我在一位中國華僑的住宅，看到過一幅比利時全國鐵道詳圖，幾乎每一座城市，每一個小鎭，都有鐵道的幹綫或支綫。許多經商的華僑，化五千法郞一個月，買一個長期『派司』，便可以走遍全國，無往而不便。</p>
<p>旅比華僑</p>
<p>華僑在比國極少，總共不到一百人，他們有一個組織：『旅比華商協會」，會長倪作有，一個忠厚年高的老實人。華僑多半業皮革生意，製造皮包，皮袋，皮夾之類，經濟情况遠不及荷蘭。比京沒有中國餐館，聽說若干荷蘭和巴黎的僑領，正集資在布魯塞爾籌備一家大規模的中國餐館，單就房屋生財，已經投資了三萬多美金。</p>
<p>僑匯限制</p>
<p>比國的回國僑匯，在歐洲是一件外交上的大成功，瞿純伯代辦在一九四五年，和比國財政金融當局接洽，比國國家銀行　面允許華僑，每人每月可以匯五千比國法郞，約合一百一十五美金，有眷屬的，可以匯一萬法郞，僑胞匯款，需先經過華商協會』的證明，然後赴大使館領取匯款申請單，由請單上寫明『根據比國當局那年那月的公函，准匯多少法郞』。聽說，比國外匯管制當局，對此頗有點懊悔，因爲數目定得太高，（法國全年僅准華僑匯款五千法個法郞，約合十七美金），但瞿代辦說：『這是敲釘轉脚了的，誰都不能翻悔』！據說，單就一九四六年一年，旅比的華僑，匯款回國總數超過一百萬比幣。</p>
<p>但是，危機是：華僑們的小手工業，現在一天天在開始沒落，賺錢少，生活貴，再加之彼此的競爭。當我每次路經比國，看到我們辛勤艱苦的僑胞，再想到他們的廣大企業機構和對外投資，眞有無窮的警惕之感！（於剛泰壁飯店）、</p>

<p>〔本報陜州十四日航訊〕豫西，這個地瘠民貧，文化落後，交通不便，形勢險要的地區，一向不曾被人注意過，自從去年八月廿二日匪酋陳庚親率所部十萬之衆，由陜州渡過黄河，一舉而佔領豫西，使中原大局整個動搖之後，一般人才開始認識这個地區在兵要地理上的價値，基於這個新的認識，又引起了一個共同的警覺：「無豫西，即無中原，守中原必先保豫西」，然而事實上，豫西是一天一天的沉淪一天一天的糜爛，中原大局也一天一天的隨之惡化，焦憂鎖住了中原人的眉頭，恐怖佔據了中原的每個角落。但强悍的豫西同胞，畢竟在共匪血的敎訓中自覺的站了起來，逐漸肅淸了頑匪，收復了自己的家鄉，救出了自己的父兄，使豫西又慢慢恢復了原來的面目，减輕了中原全局沉重的威脅，在勘亂自衛的課題中，這是傳奇式的一章。記者老早就被傳說誘惑着想到這一帶巡視一下刦後的慘狀，採访一些民間戰鬥英雄揭竿而起剿匪自救的壯烈史實，恰好上月底承豫西各界特邀前來，所以我就欣然應允了。</p>
<p>走馬入函谷</p>
<p>到浴陽，算是踏進了豫西的大門，我的目的地是由洛西進，沿新安，澠池，陝縣，靈寳，而到闵鄉但到了洛陽之後，才知道洛潼公路只通了幾天軍車，因澠池以東奸匪不時南北流竄，交通又斷絕了。本想折返鄭州搭飛機到西安再東轉豫西，但又據軍事負責人談洛潼公路日內即恢復通車，所以就在洛陽等候了七天，二月八號（陰歷臘月廿九日）的早上，才算以黄魚的姿態被裝私貨般的裝上了軍隊的汽油車，向西出發了。</p>
<p>車行如飛，一個多鐘頭，就到新安縣了，城東門外那座歷經變亂而仍屹立無恙的「古函谷關」碑，比德日更蒼老寂寞了，鐵軌像被分解了的屍體，破碎支離的拋棄在鐵道兩旁，路基也被挖的亂七八糟，它什麼時候才能復活呢？當它的屍體觸着我的視綫的時候，我對這條通德西北的大動脈起了無限的感嘆和傷心。</p>
<p>新安這座山城，曾經留過我不少的足跡，這裏的城垣和房屋在我腦海里保留着深刻的印象，但這次當汽車把我載進新安縣城的時候，我再也不相信這就是我熟悉的那座山城，進了東門滿眼全是斷壁殘垣，共匪和國軍的標語對立在這些斷墻上，那些倖免於難的殘缺市房，無門無窗，有的已經磚石泥土代替門窗了，糞土垃圾狼藉滿街，野狗亂竄，行人稀少，我覺得走入了荒墳，不由得打了一個寒噤，有點毛骨悚然了。車子停在破廟似的縣府前，我正預備下車，車下邊已出現了幾個似曾相識的面孔，他們握住了我的手，我方認出了那是新安縣長郭品三和該縣警察局長李逢春與共匪持久艱苦的搏鬥他們已失了原來的型範，破舊的衣服，瘦黄的面孔，可以告訴人半年來他們的生活情形，他們事前得到消息我要過那裏，所以專意在等候我，並且堅邀我停一天，我雖然因爲不敢躭誤汽車而沒答應他們的邀請，但利用車伕吃飯的時間，我共逗留了兩個鐘頭。</p>
<p>縣府如破廟</p>
<p>縣政府，如今已完全成了一座破廟，從大街上一直可以毫無阻碍的看到最後那座房，德日縣府大門左右那一遍繁榮氣象，如今已無影無踪，縣府東隔壁那座鮮花樓飯店現在已成了公共厠所，縣府的大門前滿目荒凉，置身其間，眞有無限悽楚和滄桑之感，這里沒有賣飯吃的，承他們的好意，爲我買了兩個冷饃，據他們告我說，該縣自去年八日共匪由狂口渡河南犯後，縣城經過四次淪陷，屢次爭奪拉鋸，城里已變成鬼域了，這一次雖然已經收復了一個多月，但居民或被匪裹脅，或慘遭殺戮，或逃亡他鄉，到如今城里的人口已不及以前十分之三了，全縣公私損失，雖尙無精確數字統計，但經這千古大刧，地方元氣，恐五十年內亦難恢復，城北鄉方圓七十里內已斷絕人烟，共匪不但將那地區的人口物資悉數搶去，即水井亦全被塡平，即令短期能將境內殘匪肅淸，而復員工作亦非該縣力量所能馬上完成，地方武力原已損失殆盡，後以十八支槍起而剿匪，現已擴充兩千支槍，他們對剿匪似乎有堅强的信心，但他們有一個更迫切的希望，就是渴待政府趕辦救濟。</p>
<p>新安到澠池是九十華里，原來兩個鐘頭可以到的，但偏偏到了澠池東三十多里的千秋北邊，車子拋了錨，那里正是共匪的南北走廊，車子停在恐怖的曠野，寒風襲繫着幾十個旅客驚悸的心，偶有國軍的騎巡隊飛馳而過，但戰馬蕭蕭，除給人以更恐怖的心情外，不能給人心理上一點保障，加以荒草遍野，狐兎成羣，舉目四顧，益感胆顫心驚，所幸經過一個鐘頭的搶修，車子終於又開動了，當天下午落日照大旗的時候，我和其餘幾十個陌生的旅客同到了遍體鱗傷的澠池，城關到處都是兵，到處都是工事，東關那些整齊的牌坊和碑樓正在被軍隊拆磚作碉堡，生意家冷落得封門閉戶，戰爭的氣氛，仍然龍罩着這個小而且窮的縣城。</p>
<p>欵待不速客</p>
<p>澠池是個最窮苦的縣份，從去年被匪佔據後，幾個月中已變成了人間地獄，目前雖然縣城收復了，而鄉間仍有共匪　　竄擾，民窮財盡，十室十空，目前雖然城內大軍　集，但仍不能立刻使這個先天不足現已氣息奄奄的窮城繁榮起來，城內只有幾家小飯舖，沒有商號和旅店，在這種情形下，我不得不到縣府去投宿，縣府是和新安縣府同樣的破襤荒凉，後院的房子已被共匪破壞無餘，縣長和所有的辦公人員都擠在縣府前院西北角一個小院里，學生王君在這里當秘書，看見我驚喜交集，而我幾乎不認識他了，董縣長把我接進了屋里，緊握着手，却說不出來一句話，他是個沉默寡言，埋頭苦幹的靑年人，縣立節師肄業，渦去作渦區長，在地方上原無地位，但這次淪陷後，他以在野之身，堅毅英勇的發動民衆起而剿匪，使縣境逐漸收復，十一區專屠以他剿匪有功，所以在該孩子前縣長開基殉職之後，就派他代理縣長，現在他已由幾十條槍擴充至一千多條槍了，他對我這個不速之客之飄然而來，感到異常興奮，當時就吩咐準備飯食，歡迎佳賓，並把他自己的床舖讓給我睡，我們由地方淪陷談到共匪的槍殺搶掠，又由自衛剿匪談到復員情形，他說澠池淪陷後地方武力損失無餘，民衆慘遭殺戮者不下五百人，公私損失在二萬億以上，目前東北鄉尙集結共匪七千餘地方團隊正配合國眾進剿，地方民窮財盡，渴待救濟，不然的話，春荒期間不知要餓死多少人。我們團爐縱談，不覺已到了八點鐘，我旣餓且累，但飯不來，我又不好說，董縣長　進距出，似乎也在催飯，一直到八點半鐘，飯才端了來，那是四菜一湯，我不等驟就開始吃了，可是一個飯沒吃完，忽然聽到外邊一羣人呼嘯而進，提着董縣長的名高聲呌罵，大有一齊衝進屋裏把董縣長「白刀子進紅刀十出來」的樣子，我大吃一驚，董縣長也呆住了，誰也不曉得那是什麽人，更不曉得是爲了什麼事情，在座的一位梁副總隊長趕快帶着兩個弟兄出去看究竟，我們在屋里只聽到院里發威風的人和攔阻的人爭吵怒罵道：「董縣長有膽就出來，看老子敢做你不敢，他媽的　就這樣子辦我們丢人你訪問訪問我們幾個連長是好惹的不是，你就是招待天老爺吃飯，也得到館十里問問是誰在座，今天不說個道理，老子非拚命不可！」攔阻的人馬上陪不是道：「縣長不在家，底下人沒知識，獲罪各們請包涵！」對方又罵道：「你們的縣長不在趕快把剛才到館子去的那個人交出來，否則決不甘休。」我聽到了這種情形，眞是立坐不安，但又沒法出去解圍，爲我受辱的董縣長在那兒忍氣呑聲，渾身顫抖，院里戰雲密佈，人聲鼎沸，眼看這一塲爲我而起的武劇，就要爆發，我想着我這個記者挨一頓飽打，甚至帶去受更不堪設想的酷刑，在目前倒並不稀奇，只是呌政府任命的縣長横遭一次毆辱，這算什麽話呢！</p>

<h3>為教育叫屈</h3>
<p>— 莫仲義</p>
<p>近來有不少的人罵敎育，怨敎育，恨敎育，譏笑敎育，說敎育破產了，說敎育走錯了路，說敎育害人，說敎育誤國，國家社會的一切不良現象，都歸咎於敎育本身，似乎要敎育負起了國家社會的全部責任。罵敎育的人，本於兩種心理，其一是期望敎育太切，以爲敎育是萬能，認爲敎育辦得好，則一切都有辦法；其二是漠視敎育，看不起敎育，以爲敎育只是政治的工具，隨政客攏佈，任人利用。這兩種心理都是偏激的，敎育工作的人負在這兩種心理的夾攻之下，於是受人攻擊，受人謾罵，受人嘲笑，受人挪揄！我單在敎育界工作的人，食不飽，衣不暖，終日爲了柴米油鹽，自已敎人家的子弟，而自己的子弟都無處讀書，已够喪氣，甚且還得不到社會人士的諒解，任人辱罵，怎不敎人呌屈！</p>
<p>吃粉筆灰的人對他如此辱罵</p>
<p>罵敎育的人是太多了，我們在報章雜誌中時常可以看到那些不負責任的話。我們反躬自問，敎育的確沒有辦得好。然而中國的事，又有那些辦得好的？拿統計數字來看，客觀地分析，敎育事業在中國不致比任何的事業都壞？都無成績吧？我們平心而論，中國的政治，經濟，社會任何一方面，其成績又在那裏？我們在敎育界工作的人，不敢誇張，也不能誇張對敎育有什麽大的貢獻；我們也不原諒自己，不固步自封，我們應該承認對敎育尙未盡了最大的責任。我們要自責，要努力求進步。然而，環觀我們中國，又有那一界負起過它應負的偉大任務？有那一個角落裏是合我們理想的，無可指摘的？爲什麽人們要罵敎育，多罵敎育，而不罵其他？對吃粉筆灰，賣嘴，面黄肌瘦，手無寸鐵的人，如此辱罵，我們雖不氣餒，也得呌屈！</p>
<p>最近大公報於本年二月二十日，廿一日和廿三日一連三天，登載了兩篇文章，一篇是張天祿先生寫的「我向全國敎育家控訴」，連登兩天，洋洋大文；另一篇是顧震乾先生寫的「這樣的敎育應當控訴」，是補充張天祿先生的「控訴」不足。我們讀了之後，覺得敎育又挨了兩次罵，從直覺上似乎張噸兩先生罵得都有道理，然而淸夜自思，我們又不能不爲敎育呌屈！</p>
<p>張先生以身歷其境，指出從入小學到大學畢業所受教育的歷害，因而向全國敎育家控訴四點：第一，「各級的升學考試實在並不能眞正負起選擇合格靑年的使命，相反地它變成了摧殘靑年身心，壓迫比它低一級的學校敎育的一個壞制度」。第二，「敎育不是有錢人的裝飾品專利品，每個人受敎育的機會均等，這是民主國家的起碼條件，至於師範生的待遇，更不能與普通學生的公費看成一樣作用」。第三，「傅統敎育妨礙社會生活的發展，要求改進傳統敎育供適合大衆生活的需要，進一步爲改進社會的張本」。第四，「傳統敎育專門注重書本和文字的訓練，扼殺靑年個性，養成一批書呆學歷」。最後歸結到：「近年來生活維艱，我在大學還有公費可吃，說不定家裏人在餓飯也不曉得。國家敎育十餘年，家庭期待十餘年，自己受苦十餘年，臨到快要大學畢業了，展望前途，反而一片黑暗，我為我的前途悲哀，我更感到傳統敎育的不合理，不健全，因此本着實際經騐把我所受傳統敎育的迫害寫出來，藉供全國敎育家的一個參考」。</p>
<p>看出教育毛病卻不得不控訴</p>
<p>願先生的大文指出，各級學校都是爲了升學準備；「小學是爲了準備升中學，中學所授的功課又是準備升大學，而大學呢？……還是針對了你應考留學」，「都是依賴於上一級，根本沒有它自身獨立的人格」，繼而指摘考試制度的不合理，背誦「升學指南」，「投考折南」，「會考指南」，「會考必備」的不當，最後歸結到敎育離現實生活太遠，結果跨出校門，就在「敷衍」「混飯吃」「感到找職業的痛苦」，因而說：「眞的，我們現在的學校敎育，除供有錢人升學之用外，其他簡直一無用處。」</p>
<p>張顧兩先生看出了教育的毛病，然而這些毛病統統要歸咎到敎育本身，實在也太寃枉，我們要爲敎育呌屈，不得不提出答辯。</p>
<p>我們先答辯張先生的控訴。第一，各級升學考試不能負起選擇合格靑年的使命，這話祗說中了一半，並不全對，世界各國都是大學比中學多，中學比小學多，中國自不能例外。在多數中選擇少數，只有兩種辦法，其一是舉行升學考試，其二是由低一級的學校保送，如果僅憑志願即可升學，不但目前中國做不到，即世界各國也還做不到。保送有缺點，因爲全國各學校的程度不一，有些學校成績最優的學生，與其他的學校比較可能是平庸的，辦理學校行政，尤其是辦理敎務行政的人，很能知道，因此對保送學生很難定出一個客觀的標準。舉行升學考試，確有如張先生所指出的毛病，但沒有想出更好的選擇學生辦法之前，升學考試不失爲一個較適宜的辦法。現各學校招收新生，冬採招考與保送兼用。據我校的統計，錄取的新生，其在校成績每較保送的學生爲佳，竹詢間他校，亦多爲同樣的現象。考試制度未能盡善盡美，辦敎育的人都右滄海遺珠之感，然而碰「運氣」的不竟少數，若說多數好學生因有升學考試而不能入學，多數壞學生却因有升學考試而碰了「運氣」，那末升學考試的確是不能再用了。然而又有什麽客觀的事實可以證明？在沒有更完美的選擇學生方法發明之前，兼採升學考試與保送制度並無錯誤。至如何改善升學考試，使其更能負起選擇合格靑年的使命，不摧殘靑年身心，不壓迫低一級的學校，那正是教育界應有的努力。（未完）</p>

<h3>米市到貨雖然不旺　場外喊價已漸低落　麺粉食油雜糧米價下降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨米市到貨仍不旺，僅一四一四石。塲內正常交易仍陷停頓，當局爲維持民食，將拋米數量再予增加，昨日共拋出蕪湖機秈一三六五五石，由二二一八家米號分配。塲外喊價已漸站定，因當局對處理本市物價問題已採取緊急措置，加以蔣主席返京，人心安定，而且連日暴漲，巳至頂峯，貨主以三百萬關之願望已達，吐售不乏其人。進戶對此高價，亦有所顧忌，不敢貿然而納。故昨日塲外交易，各米均已退入三百萬關內。白粳爲二百九十萬，薄稻二百八十五萬，早稻退至二百八十萬元，各跌十五萬元之多。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>因米市下跌。欲振乏力。量開即見賣氣濃郁，散戶相繼喊售。小麥價雖升至二百萬，已不足爲上漲之刺激矣。昨日價格已在限度以內，故塲外交易一變而爲在市上公開交易。老車粉甫開即退進一百四十萬關內，曾低至一百三十八萬，收市一百三十九萬。兵船以一百三十七萬收市，他如紅蜂建成各較上日價小五六萬元，麩皮小三萬。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>一瀉千里，生豆油及各色食油莫不疾瀉。乃因連日上漲過鉅，昨米市旣已傾落，遂亦蒙其影響。進戶不前，貨主競售，油廠亦有吐售，頓聞一片賣出聲。廠豆油開市六百三十萬，後六百二十萬（大有餘）。大昌新豆油更低至六百十五萬，最低者爲同豐豆油，爲六百十萬元，較上日猛降六七十萬元。靑島吉桶生油最低至七百萬關，收市七百〇五萬，軋小四十五萬元。生菜油等均挫六七十萬，小車蔴油小降五六十萬，豆餅同吿猛落，下降七八萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>全面回小，漢口乍豆晨開已跌至一百六十萬元，低十五萬元，後更小至一百五十五萬元，猛跌達一成以上。芝蔴菉豆跟跌十萬元，生仁到湧貨衆，廣帮不來拾取，市勢疲莫能興。南京生仁開三百四十萬元，降達五十萬元之鉅。揀靑小回五萬元。獨苞米高檔貨俏利，啓東苞米開二百二十萬元，計升二十萬元，此乃因海州帮動辦換鹽，奮進不已，市勢不易回小。中關貨苞米日前上升已鉅，昨日市價不分軒輊。</p>
<h3>洋米煤斤運滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國總統輸船公司搭虎塔總統輪，此次自舊金山運來美米五萬五千五百包，昨日下午抵埠，現靠招商局六號碼頭（即前三菱碼頭）起卸，該米係中信局救濟米。</p>
<p>華强輪自大沽新港遝來煤四千餘噸，昨日下午到滬，現泊浦東開平碼頭起卸。又南强輪，自秦皇島運來煤六千七百噸，亦定昨日下午抵滬，預定靠開灤碼頭起卸。</p>
<p>招商局鴻章輪，定今日裝交儲處救濟麵粉一萬四千包，運往天津。</p>
<h3>食糖囙降</h3>
<p>食糖連日激漲，步步高升，昨已開始回跌。公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白降廿五萬元至三十五萬元。四半白降四十萬元至四十五萬元。二〇中砂白降度相仿，其他土糖僅有呌價，未聞成交。但據汕頭電訊；產價步緊，劃申成本，反較申市爲高，在糖價中靑糖較爲平定，一時似無過小之望。棧單交易進出仍多，價格上落達六七十萬元，結果八期小四十餘萬元，九劃小三十八萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市迂迥見疲</h3>
<p>茶市昨晨開仍因執主减價激昂，趨勢續露鋒鋩，後因百物普遍報跌，人心亦迂迥稍餒，以迄收市，除若干花色，終猶軋升外，餘則一致原途徘徊。內銷茶猶若得水之魚，買戶感於本街與蘇錫一帶之去化絡繹不絕。活動之意，依然興奮。他若外銷茶，出口商嫌價奇昂，態度咸懷束手，情勢岑靜如故。</p>
<h3>柴炭上升</h3>
<p>昨日柴炭市况，以火油迭漲不已，市民對於燃料，大都改用柴炭，致門莊去化奇暢。做開市盤因到存兩稀，喊價挺俏異常，栗柴每擔售十七萬五千元，松柴十四萬五千元，靑炭每擔漲至五十八萬元，白炭五十一萬元，烏炭四十四萬元，軋升達一成半左右。</p>
<h3>本材騰漲</h3>
<p>木材市面以外匯及其他物資上漲，做開市盤亦跟踵飛騰。更因建築帮採辦，零銷亦佳，致行情繼續增高。五分松板鋸方每丈漲至一百萬元，一丈建板售七十五萬元，紅星四分松板五十五萬元，洋松每尺昂至五萬元，杉木每尺一萬二三千元。較之前週杉不漲達一倍，洋松上升有六成之鉅，其他各貨扯升一二成不等。</p>
<h3>人心恐慌斬售頻起　棉紗布逐步下游　四二支細紗較上日降一千萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因當局辦理存棉登記，並禁止移動等揹置，人心遂吿不振，又値紡建公司開售之期，斬售頻起，市勢以數日猛漲，行情已達頂點，各方因此均呈觀望，而散戶及檯面帮則逢高有吐，各級行情均吿邁步下游。迨至最後，四十二支藍鳳細紗爲一億二千萬元收市，較之上日疾退一千萬元，其餘各支粗細紗，亦一致回降，自三四十萬至三百四五十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開即告下瀉，並傳當局對目前各市塲之紊亂情勢，將有嚴厲之措施，澈査一切非法買賣活動，禁止棉花自由買賣，限制移動等消息公佈，人心極度恐慌，多頭競吐，塲內賣風展開，行情逐步下游。迨至最後，十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，較上日均回落自四萬至八萬元，此外嗶嘰直貢漂布等，價亦跟蹤下瀉。惟色布及士林布因廠盤堅秀，市勢依然俏利云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例開紗，公司掛牌售出一七五九件，合廿支紗三〇一一件，申購單共五九八張。代紗管會售紗三七八件，合廿支紗在六百件左右，申購單一〇七張。</p>
<p>各支紗開價，廿支金雙鷄六四〇〇萬元，六支副日光三五〇〇萬元，十支立馬三九〇〇萬元，卅二支陽鶴八五〇〇萬元，四〇支寶光九五〇〇萬元，四二支寶光一〇五〇〇萬元，六〇支日光一九〇〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>棉花停止自由買賣</h3>
<p>本市棉花業自昨日起，已遵令停止自由買賣，故昨日靈寶花，沙市花，漢口細絨，通州細絨等國產棉花均無市，整日並無黑市交易發現。但棉花商等對花管會此舉殊表反感，彼等並向各界表示，當局禁止棉花自由買賣，等於促成該業全體從業員陷於失業之境云。</p>
<p>又花紗布管理委員會澈査各倉庫存棉事，定今日起開始進行，同時知照海關對新進口之棉花，亦全部予以登記云。</p>
<h3>呢羢續見高翔</h3>
<p>呢羢市價，受米價絲紗及日用品之狂漲影響，全部續趨高翔，元嫂協新有字西裝花呢，每碼均批沽二百五六十萬元，章華二百二十五萬元凈盤，上海紡毛花呢三百四十萬元，中厚嗶嘰一百五十萬至一百九十萬元，宣維一百八十五萬至二百二十萬元，寅豐黄華達呢二百三十萬元，藏靑及草綠色一百八十萬元，達隆薄素嗶嘰一百十萬元，夾色花呢一百八十五萬元，染色花呢一百四十萬元，勤奮灰法蘭羢一百三十五萬元。</p>
<h3>去年生比外銷　印度佔第一位</h3>
<p>據中信局統計，去年生絲外銷，以印度爲第一位，緬甸次之，英國佔第三位，美國爲第四位。外銷數量內，美國一三五〇担，但其中一二〇〇爲寄售性質，截止目前爲止，外銷總數爲四一二三担，內銷爲一五二五担，共計五六四八担。絲織品外銷，自印度禁止輸入後，其他各國雖可運銷，但爲數無幾，故前途黯淡，負責協助推廣之絲織外銷協會雖已奉令結束，惟生絲銷印，則見增加，因印度現着重輸人原料，自織綢緞云。</p>

<h3>華股多空互軋　起仆飄忽靡定</h3>
<p>華股昨永紗以塲外停做新交易，了結者衆，多空互軋，起仆飄忽。美亞國貨景綸永業聯華遂吿漲停，雜股大有代之而興之勢。</p>
<p>晨初除景綸仍開高盤，國貨稍形見秀外，餘股均因主席返京之故，咸開低盤。永紗以一〇七五元及一〇八〇元之價登塲，開後一一六號等進即交，七六號等進遞交，升至一一一五元及一一三五元高價。二二號等脫手，退至一〇八〇元及一一一〇元，景綸國貨求方過股，又吿漲停。一一七號等進即交，七六號進遞交，而升至一一〇〇元及一一三〇元。七一號等脫售即交，塲外息價開高至二角四及二角八角半，退至一〇六七元及一〇九二元。一八八號等紛買即交，五二號進遞交，回升至一一一五元及一一三二元。塲外査禁風聲更緊，且有亨鼠行將停止對敲之訊，近午仍起跌風，塲外且慘瀉於先，永紗午收退至一〇六〇元及一一〇〇元。現遞拔開更遠，除景綸國貨受實際擁戴，仍站高檔外，餘亦吿回。結果較前收即交股景綸漲停，國貨升成半，中絲大通小升，美亞好半成，永紗中法信和華豐火柴新光麗安景福勤興商務新華中泥統益各跌半成至一成不等，餘咸微挫。遞交股美亞漲半成，永紗新光景福跌少許，餘降半成。</p>
<p>後市永紗自一〇七〇元及一〇九五元起，由二二〇號等出即交，七八號出遞交，降爲一〇四八元及一〇六五元低價。塲外業已停做新交易，入後全在多空擠軋之情形下，起仆飄忽，幾而略有軋空之勢。二一八號等進即交，三六號現遞俱納，八號等進遞交，國行雖有差進，國貨景綸漲停，美亞永業聯華亦掛漲停，永紗回升至一一三五元及一一四五元高價，但繼之軋多亦起，一二號出現遞，一八三號等了結即交，七一號等脫手遞交，永紗收市跌至一〇九〇元及一一〇八元。較前收即交股景綸聯華永業漲停，美亞火柴中絲升半成，永公平平統益小挫，餘均微升。遞交股美亞再升半成，華豐微挫，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票，以文化股及銀行股再升一成爲最俏，餘尙平庸。</p>
<h3>統債續漲　外股回挫</h3>
<p>公債昨賡續趨漲，統丙晨開九萬二，自八萬八漲至一〇萬三高價，而後略回。大成興五〇三室五〇〇室均進，五五五室五五二室五五〇室買進，成交約六百萬。較前收計甲乙丙各漲一萬，丁種升一萬元，戊種漲八千元。</p>
<p>外股昨熱股開始回跌，證劵帮脫手，廣帮洋行帮均買。怡紗晨開一一九萬，自一一六萬回好到一二五萬，而後退入一二〇萬內結束。橡皮股及雜股已有開做，極爲俏利。結果較前收除雜股外，怡紗航業跌一成弱，會德豐升半成，英聯業廣怡啤鋼業各跌半成，紙版尙平。</p>
<h3>國藥產價報升</h3>
<p>國藥市况，各路去胃平淡，而川產各貨來電報升，又兼遝費外繳奇昂，申存已稀，後市看升。洋廣各貨因匯水又騰，客家未敢拋售。昨日港電廣皮三千三百萬，佛手片三千二百萬，淸甲片一千二百萬，防己三百六十萬。</p>
<h3>茶葉輸出業公會　電陳本年茶貸意見　請照去年成案分三期貸放</h3>

<p>該會以本年國茶物量，除台灣外，預計各區約共二十四萬餘擔。按各區慣例，收製茶葉，恒比照米價折算，毛茶每擔約等於食米三擔，暫按二擔半計，加精製包裝徵用等，約合食米一擔半。總計各區箱茶到滬，平均每擔成本共須等於食米六擔，爲增加出口物資生產，補助外匯收入，該會特依據同業公意，對於本年度茶貨，貢獻意見四點。</p>
<p>（一）本年度收製外銷箱茶，除茶廠設備，槪由茶商負責，不予算入成本外，茶葉生產成本，依上述總成本計算，請照蠶絲貸款辦法，以茶商自資百分之十，及政府貸款百分之九十，配合辦理。</p>
<p>（二）政府貸款部份，請照三十六年度成案辦理，分三期貸放。第一期貸放毛茶加工貸款，占成本總値百分之五十，限期一個月，精製完成。第二期貸款，佔成本總値百分之二十，第三期貸放抵押貸款，佔成本總值百分之二十。</p>
<p>（三）抵押貸款期限，定爲三個月，如遇市面停滯，或出口不能符合時，請延長二個月，到期請政府顧及茶商事實上困難，予以收購，及保障茶商應得之合法利潤。</p>
<p>（四）箱茶抵押利息，請照三十六年度辦法計算，並准由茶商同業擔保。</p>
<p>至本年度各區茶葉生產景之估計共爲二十四萬一千擔。祁紅二萬擔，屯綠三萬擔，平綠七萬擔，溫紅七千擔，溫綠八千擔，閩紅二萬五千擔，閩綠一萬五千擔，湘紅二萬擔，鄂紅五千擔，寗紅一萬擔，婺（源）一萬五千擔，河（口）紅三千擔，玉綠五千擔，遂綠八千擔。</p>
<h3>棉紗配價可望改善　集中報價簡化手續</h3>
<p>紡建公司配售棉紗，自前日改議價爲報價，而核價又飛漲，複製業嘖有煩言。某負責人曾與紗管會袁主委及紡建束吳總副經理商談，對於原行議價之缺少彈性，咸認爲有改善之必要。而對於最近所行之報價辦法，由各廠報價投標，配價却又由紡建另定核價，以致購價者不能預知紗價，報價者患得患失，計價者不遑詳晰，有行無市，配價形同揭謎，手續紛擾，刺激人心，複製業認爲非再加改善不可。據袁主委表示，報價不必採取各戶分報，各業如能推定負責代表，向紡建辦理報價，即便與配紗機關商定配價，則簡化手續，亦屬可行。紡建當局對此，尙在考慮。惟曾表示當力謀配價之合理，及配量之增加云。昨日（二十七日）機器染織業正式具呈紗管會，對於當前之報價辦法，建議改善。</p>
<h3>臺煤的新生與扶植</h3>
<p>談起臺煤新生命的誕生與其扶植，首先就要說到國內煤炭的供求問題。本來我國東南沿海各大都市的用煤，依靠北方各大礦的供給。自從共匪在北方加緊擾亂以來，各礦產量頓减，或陷於停頓，或運輸被阻，以致京滬及華南各處，均感煤荒嚴重，因而臺煤在國內市塲的地位益加重要，各方對臺煤的增產，期待亦漸加股切，</p>
<p>任重致遠</p>
<p>臺煤的供應，在目前已負荷上旣須任重又致遠的任務，從事煤礦業的每個員工，正沉着氣息爲此難重任務而努力工作。其供應的範圍，可分爲內銷與外銷兩部。省內的主要用戶，爲鐵路及全部公營的各種工業。需量最大的，要算是製糖，製紙，水泥，機器，窰業，紡織，烟酒，樟腦各業。省外則全部由上海燃料管理委員會統籌支配，包括上海，廣州，福州，厦門，靑島各地區。就內銷說，因爲省內工業復員的加速，已有顯著的增加。例如糖業方面，去年度製糖不過三萬餘噸，而本年度則激增至卅餘萬噸，本期製糖的用煤，就需十萬餘噸，目前正値製糖季節，僅糖業一項的煤斤配額，即爲每月三萬噸。糖業需煤的激增，除了隨着製糖產量增加外，還有一種原因。過去糖廠的蔗渣，均用為鍋爐燃料，現因資委會紙業公司製造紙漿部份，業已復工，此項蔗渣可以大量利用作製造紙漿原料，解決目下的原料需要，因而原由蔗渣擔負的燃料，也須由煤炭來頂補。水泥業方面，去年產量，每月不過一萬二千噸，現已達到每月二萬噸的產量，用煤量亦自每月五六千噸增至一萬餘噸，其他各種工業及交通方面的用煤，亦均逐漸增加，內銷煤的每月配額，已自三個月前的十萬餘噸，繳增至目前十萬零五千噸，將來還有隨着工業復舊程度長足進步而續有增加，這在工業方面，雖是一個極好的現象，在煤礦業則愈感到擔負的加重。關於外銷煤量，臺灣向來均竭力供應，卅六年一整年，共輸出四十三萬一千八百七十五噸，現經臺省與經濟部上海燃管會協商，就省內外需要情形作一個衡量，應該先供給省內後再應付省外，因爲省內是用煤來增加生產的，結果暫定爲每月輸出四萬噸。據臺省當局表示：對京滬需煤的迫切極表憂慮，今後除供應省內必需數量外，當盡量設法外運，期能超過現在暫定每月四萬噸之數。</p>
<p>最高產量</p>
<p>在如此重負下，產煤的產量究竟能否勝任愉快呢？以過去情形說，日治時代，一九三七年以前，臺煤的年產量，平均在一百五十至一百八十萬公噸之間，亦即每月在十二至十五萬噸之間。那時器材無憂匱乏，運鹼暢通，利潤穩定，種種條件，俱比現在優越得多，煤產的吒盛，自爲必然的結果。迨至大戰末期，日人積極增產，一九四一年曾達年產二百八十萬噸。不過這是戕賊性的增產，日人爲求濟急於一時，竟連炭柱都採掘下來，遂造成了今日降炭困難的惡果。自一九四二年起至光復前後，煤產已逐年降落至月產三萬餘噸。經過政府的不斷努力，民國卅五年，巳生產一百萬零五千五百餘噸，卅六年中復增至一百三十餘萬噸，每月平均十一萬噸，雖然目前生產條件是這樣的不濟，但較之日治時代的產量，已達百分的七十。本年度生產計劃，全年爲二百萬公噸，一月份已激增至十四萬五千噸，造成光復以來的最高紀錄。若無意外困難，不難達到最高的理想，外銷煤量也就可能超過每月四萬噸的定量。（未完）</p>

<h3>水經注的校訂史可以說明校勘學方法</h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>在十多年前，我寫陳垣先生的「元典章校補釋例」的序，曾泛論校勘學的方法。我曾說：「用善本對校是校勘學的靈魂，是校勘學的唯一途徑。……如闕文，如錯簡，如倒葉，如不經見的人名地名或不經見的古字俗字，均非對校無從猜想。」</p>
<p>「推理之最精者（如王念孫段玉裁諸公）往往也可以補版本的不足。低校警的本義在於用本子互勘。雖開本子的搜求而費精刀於推敲，終不是校勘學的正軌。」</p>
<p>這篇文章（收在胡適論學近著第一集，頁一三五至一四八）在當時頗引起了一點抗議，因爲批評王念孫段玉裁，說他們不是校勘學正軌，那是正統學者不容易許可的。但我說的校勘學方法實在是一切校勘學者公認的方法。例如陳垣先生校勘元典章，補得闕文一百零二葉之多，推理的校勘能補得半個缺葉嗎？</p>
<p>我現在用明淸兩代學者訂正不經注的歷史來說明善本對校確是校勘學的靈魂。</p>
<p>黄省曾刻的水經注（嘉靖十二年，西曆一五三四）有十大缺　：</p>
<p>（一）無　道元自序</p>
<p>（二）卷一有錯簡一葉</p>
<p>（三）卷二有錯簡一葉</p>
<p>（四）卷九與卷十三各互錯兩藥</p>
<p>（五）卷廿二潁水篇有錯簡一葉</p>
<p>（六）卷廿二渠水篇有錯簡一葉</p>
<p>（七）卷卅有錯簡一葉</p>
<p>（八）卷十八脫去第二葉</p>
<p>（九）卷十八之尾脫去末葉五行八十五字。</p>
<p>（十）卷卅一脫去一葉，錯在卷卅三江水篇中。</p>
<p>這十處大缺陷，吳琯校刻本（萬曆十三年，一五八五）都沒有改動校正，因爲他沒有見到別的善本可以比勘。</p>
<p>朱謀埠（萬曆四十三年，一六一五）用了謝兆申的「宋本」（當是鈔宋本），改正了十處之中的六處：</p>
<p>卷一的錯葉。</p>
<p>卷二的錯葉。</p>
<p>卷九與卷十三的錯葉。</p>
<p>卷卅的錯葉。</p>
<p>卷十八的末葉五行</p>
<p>卷卅一的脫葉</p>
<p>朱謀埠曾想校訂卷廿二潁水篇的錯葉，但他改來改去，還是錯了，還是不可讀。渠水篇的錯葉，他竟沒有看出。</p>
<p>到了乾隆九年（一七四四），全祖望與趙一淸借得揚州馬家的孫潛校本。孫潛用柳僉的鈔宋本來校朱謀諜煒本，柳僉的宋本比謝兆申的宋本有四大勝處：</p>
<p>（一）有鄂道元序的三分之二，僅缺半葉。</p>
<p>（二）穎水篇不錯葉。</p>
<p>（三）穎水篇不錯葉</p>
<p>（四）卷十八有第二葉。全趙兩家用孫潛過錄柳僉本來校水經注，於是朱謀璋留剩的四大缺陷，居然鋼補了三個又三分之二，只缺鄜序的三分之一了。</p>
<p>乾隆三十年（一七六五），戴震還沒有得見永樂大典本，但他也想校訂朱謀瑋留下的缺陷。他想訂正潁水篇的錯簡，又想訂正卷十八（渭水篇）的脫誤。他不知道穎水篇錯的是一整葉，也不知道渭水篇脫的是一整葉。他的訂補成績保存在他自訂水經一卷（北大圖書館藏一本，又建德周氏藏一本）的「附考」裏。在這兩處他的訂正工作都失敗了。因爲他沒有得見比黄省曾謝兆申更古更完好的本子。　震也不知道渠水篇錯了一整葉！</p>
<p>乾隆三十八年（一八七三），戴震在四庫館中得見永樂大典的水經注。這個本子比黄謝的本子更完好，比柳僉本也更完好。柳僉本的四大勝處，大典白本手有。柳僉本的關氏自序缺了整整半葉，大典本此序完全無缺。所以載震在乾隆卅八九年之間，把黄省曾本的十個大缺陷全都訂補了。</p>
<p>凡這種大缺陷，若沒有古本可供比勘，雖有絕項的聰明，雖有過人的功力，都不能做到滿意的校訂。朱謀瑋載震的校訂潁水錯簡，戴震的校補渭水脫葉，都是校勘學上最有益的敎訓。</p>
<p>從黄省曾本的刻成，到大典本水經注的校勘，整整二百四十年。黄刻本留下的十大缺陷，朱謀瑋訂正了六個，全祖皇趙一淸訂正了九個又三分之二，載震訂正了整十個。這都是用善本對校的成績。（卅七，二，十八夜半）</p>
<h3>清談與清議</h3>
<p>— 唐長孺</p>
<p>依照一般的解釋，淸談是一種抽象的玄遠之談，而淸議則是實際的人物批評。二者的涵義似乎不能一致。但是根據後漢三國時人的說法，當時所謂淸談，在未有玄學之先與淸議並無嚴格區別，換言之，也就是實際的人物批評。三國志卷一武帝紀注引張璠漢紀鄭泰說董卓云：（范曄後漢書卷一百鄭太傳同）</p>
<p>孔公緒能淸談高論噓枯吹生</p>
<p>又卷七臧洪傳注引九州春秋論焦和云：</p>
<p>入則見其淸談干雲，出則渾亂，命不可知。（袁宏後漢紀卷二十六略同）</p>
<p>這兩條是最早提出「淸談」一辭的。焦和的淸談內容，我們不知道，至於孔仲所談則有「噓枯吹生」之說。李賢注後漢書鄭太傳云。</p>
<p>枯者噓之使生，生者吹之使枯，言談論有所抑揚也。</p>
<p>議論有所抑揚也就是臧否人物，（或人事）後人用吹噓典故還沒有盡失原意，只是偏於「揚」的一面而已。三國志卷十三鐘絲傳注引魏略：</p>
<p>孫權稱臣，斬送關羽，太子書報際，際答晝曰：」臣同郡故司空苟爽言：</p>
<p>人當道情，愛我者一何可愛，憎我者一何可憎。顧念孫權，了更嫵媚。」太子又書曰：「得報知喜南方，至於荀公之淸談，孫權之嫵媚，執書喘噱，不能離手，若權復黑，當折以汝南許邵月旦之評。權優遊二國，俯仰荀許，亦已足矣。</p>
<p>曹丕以荀爽之言爲淸談，自然和後起的玄遠之談不相干，而許邵的汝南月旦是有名的人物批評，以之相提並論，可見不無關係。我想鍾縣曹丕的意思是說兩種批評態度，荀爽是主觀的以愛憎爲標準，許邵是客觀的以行爲作標準。如果以愛憎爲標準，則孫權嫵媚，如果以行爲作標準，則孫權的品評便須隨時改變。所以荀爽之言雖不是具體的人物批評，却也與此有關。至於荀爽是否有感而故爲此說，或是一時戲言是別一問題。</p>
<p>以淸談爲淸議之互稱，在晋書裏還有兩條例子。晋書卷四十四鄭袤附子默傅二</p>
<p>初帝（晉武帝）以貴公子當品，鄉里莫敢與爲軍，求之州內，於是十二郡中正僉共舉默，及武帝出祀南郊，詔使默驂乘，因謂默日；「……昔州里舉卿相　，常愧有累淸談。仝書卷四十五劉毅傳，孫尹舉毅爲　州大中正表有云：</p>
<p>臣州茂德惟毅，越毅不用則</p>
<p>清淡倒錯矣。</p>
<p>晋書雖是唐人改條，但第一條見於藝文類聚卷四十八引王隱晋書。第二條是章疏，史家有刪節，罕改字，所以都可信爲晋人語。這兩條所謂淸談，實即是淸議。尤其第二條說得更顯明。中正之職本在主持淸議，所以說假使不用劉毅，淸議就不免顚倒了。</p>
<p>在晋代，清談和淸議當然業已不能混爲一談，但是在習慣上仍然偶而承用前代的用法，這種偶見的例子在史籍裏而還可找出幾條。梁書卷上三沈約傳：</p>
<p>乘時藉勢，頗累淸談。</p>
<p>仝書卷二十一王陳傳；始安王遙光薦陳及王僧孺表有云：</p>
<p>勢鬥上品，猶當格以淸談。</p>
<p>仝書卷五十伏挺傳挺與徐勉書有云：</p>
<p>昔子建不欲妄讚陳琳，恐見嗤哂後代，今之過奢餘論，將不有　淸談。</p>
<p>南史卷四十一南豐伯蕭赤斧附子潁達傳：</p>
<p>第七子幾，太淸初爲魏興太守，梁州刺史……梁州有古墓，名曰尖　，或云張騫墳……（　發之）時居母服，淸談所貶。</p>
<p>以上四個例子都是以清談當淸議可見南朝後期還有這種用法，雖然只是文字上的沿製，而事實上早已俱有不同意義了。</p>
<p>關於這個名辭解釋的演變還可以推論到由漢到魏晋的思想上的連貫性。</p>
<p>東漢名士嘉歡批評人物，激濁揚淸，就是批評政事也歸重於人物。用以作批評尺度的是儒家所提倡的名敎，宋書卷六十四鄭鮮之傳說：「名敎大極忠孝而已」，所以也就是以儒家的道德信條衡量人的品行。假使不合標準，就爲人所不齒，犯了淸議。但是名敎之中也有先後輕重之分，不能不加以討論，於是「仁孝先後」，」忠孝不兩立」之類的論題以起，這一類的論題在魏晋淸談中也還可以聽到。雖不是淸談的主要部分。</p>
<p>漢人旣以道德爲批評人物的尺度，就不免忽略才能的一面，在承平之肚尙德不尙才沒有引起什麽問題，但是一到漢末大亂，就覺得道德純粹的人物未必就是撥亂之才。曹操所以毅然提出了「唯才是舉」的口號，這是人所共知的事。於是就發生了才性之辯。王充論衡本性篇已說：「人性有善有惡，猶人才有高有下也」，漢人主張「善善同其淸，惡惡同其汚」。從漢書黨鋼傳范滂語，完全注重性的方面，與性的表現，曹操却翻過來注重才的方面與才的表現。世說新語文學篇注引魏志：</p>
<p>（鍾）會論才性同異傳於世。四本者，言才性同，才性異，才性合，才性離也。尙書傳嘏論同，中書令李豐論異，侍郞鍾會論合，屯騎校尉王廣論離。才性四本之論雖已失傳，但是推測他的內容當亦不外爲人物批評之理論。三國志卷廿二虜毓傳：</p>
<p>毓於人及選舉，先舉性行而後言才。黄門李豐嘗以問毓。毓曰：「才所以爲善也，故大才成大善，小才成小善，今稱之有才而不能爲善，是才不中器也。」豐等服其言。</p>
<p>李總是論才性異的，所以對於盧毓的「先性行而後才」的選舉與批評標準不以爲然。慮毓雖不是四本論中的一家，但是他的主張分明是才性合，而以人物批評的理論行之於政事。可見爲淸談家中題的才性四本也是承襲或者反對漢魏間的批評標準而來。</p>
<p>鍾會傳嘏等所論在當時稱爲名理之學。三國志卷十荀或傳注分何邵荀粲別傳：</p>
<p>粲嘗謂（傳）嘏日：「子等在世途間，功名必勝我，但識劣我耳。」嘏難曰：能盛功名者識也，天下孰右本不足而末有餘者邪！」粲曰：「功名者志局之所獎也，然則志局自一物耳，固非識之所獨濟也，我以能使子等爲貴，然未必齊子等所爲也。」</p>
<p>這一段是論「志」「識」的離合，也是名理之學，名理之學是一種批評人物的學問。</p>
<p>淸談家主要的論題最後是「有無之辯」，或者名敎與自然的同異。這一個論題固然歸結到究竟義上，並且涵蘊甚廣，不能以人物拋評爲限，但是最早提出自然以與名敎對抗的用意還是與此有關。漢人以名敎為皈依，而在魏晋間成爲政治上之工具，借「名敎」以掃除異己，獻媚當局。於是有些不願和當局合作的人另外從道家學說中提出「自然」來，他們以別一種尺度立身，並且以之批評人物。何曾想殺阮籍的故事是人所共知的，不管何曾所提倡的名敎自己是否能實踐，與阮籍是否眞的蔑棄名敎，而何曾對於阮籍的批評是以名敎爲準繩，阮籍的自處却是方外之士，還是人物批評標準的不同。晋書卷四十九阮籍傅：</p>
<p>裴楷往弔之，（時籍喪母）籍散發箕踞，醉而直視。楷弔喭畢便去。或問楷；「凡弔者，主哭，客乃爲禮，籍旣不哭，君何爲哭？」楷曰：「阮籍旣方外之士，故不崇禮典，我俗中之士，故以軌儀自居。」時人歎爲兩得。</p>
<p>時人所以歎爲兩得，就是以兩種標準來批評裴阮。阮籍傳又說「籍發言玄遠，口不臧否人物」。固然這是他的避禍之一道，但是他旣敢公然與時主宰相所標榜的名敎反抗，更是取禍之道，可見並非全爲避禍。他的不臧否人物，正因爲漢人喜歡臧否而以名敎爲準繩，如今這一種標準已然靠不住，所以也就不屑爲之。其實他常以靑白眼表示他的態度，又何嘗無臧否呢？</p>
<p>綜上所述，淸談和淸議固然在後世分道揚鏢，不能混爲一談，但是我們就淸談家的論題看來，淸談實即從淸議中孕育而出。</p>
<h3>南詔史論</h3>
<p>— 向達</p>
<p>—唐代紀載南詔諸書考略—</p>
<p>咸通五年六月，左授夔州都督府長史，問蠻夷巴夏四邑根源，悉以錄之，寄安南諸大首領，詳錄於此，爲蠻志一十卷事，庶知南蠻首末之序。</p>
<p>這一段文字，也許就是續書的自序，錯簡在此。蠻書名稱，各書著錄亦不一致，新唐書藝文志，通鑑老異，程大昌禹貢岡蔡沈書集傳作蠻書；郡庸讀書志，宋史藝文志，元李京雲南志略，明初程本立作雲南志，宋史又出樊綽撰南蠻記，都爲十卷；蘇頌圖經本草作雲南記；永樂大典作雲南史記；太平御覧引又作南夷志。四庫著錄，名稱依新唐書。按照蠻書樊綽自稱爲蠻志一十卷之語，似乎新唐書所著錄的名稱，應比較近眞。蠻書宋以後繼續流傳，李京雲南志略自序提到樊綽此書，明洪武初起本立爲雲南布政使，至麗江，在太守張　處還看到樊綽的雲南志，程氏巽隱先生文集中雲南西行記曾紀其事。自永樂中收入大典，書遂不傳，所以四庫提要說「雖以博雅如楊慎，亦稱綽所撰為有錄無書」。至於萬暦雲南通志卷二卷三雖都引有樊綽雲南志，而文字與傳世本　書頗不類，倒很像後來方志　語，恐是傳聞之誤，樊氏書明中葉以後便已亡佚也。淸乾隆時修四庫全書，館臣始從永樂大典中將樊氏書輯出，仍依新唐書志分爲十卷，並取新唐書南詔傳及通鑑考異爲之校勘。蠻書從此遂又流傳於世。今除四庫本外，有武英殿聚珍版本，乾隆時桐華館本，汪氏振綺常本，廣雅刊聚珍版叢霄本，琳琅秘室叢書本，漸西村舍義書本，雲南備徵志本，凡七種版本。桐華館以下都出自武英殿聚珍版本；而殿本桐華館振綺堂　本也不多見。殿本大概出自文淵閣四庫，提要作於乾隆三十九年二月，時間最早；文津在四十九年，文溯在四十七年，兩本提要文字相同，而與殿本有出入，書內文字也略有異同。我們現在推測，蠻書在大典內大槪是大部分收於一韻之內，所以在國內見到大典最多的趙萬里先生就沒有見到引用蠻書的大典，在國外見到大典最多的王重民先生也只見到一條；大約引用蠻書的那」本大典在庚子，或不知道甚麽時候，一定佚失了。</p>
<p>因爲大典原本不存，四庫本有無訛誤，就無從勘正。但是從四庫館臣案語中，我們還可以看出現行本蠻書有些地方是經館臣誤改的，如：現行本卷四首紀爨歸王幾殺蓋聘蓋啓父子，蓋聘蓋啓大典本作孟軻孟啓，館臣據新唐書改正。而張曲江文集中勅安南　仁哲書，其中有昇麻縣令孟聘，由此可知新唐書誤孟爲蓋，大典孟不誤，只孟聘誤作孟軻，四庫館臣未能廣徵唐人書，遂有此失。又御覽所引南夷志，就是蠻書的別名，其中可以校補今本者不少，如卷一石門路一段末大部落則有鬼主以下，文字脫落致不可通，御電七八九暴蠻等部落條引南夾志，正是今本此段，文字完整，館臣不知利用，致今本多留遺憾。此外大典原本有不少錯簡，如今本卷四獨錦蠻條末有五十八字，與上下文不相應，卷五篇首也有五十二字與下文無關，卷八篇末一條不應在風俗篇內；這都是錯簡，館臣指出這些錯簡應在的地方都很合理。所以今本蠻書雖藉大典而偉存，然而仍待好好的校勘和還　。有淸三百年撲學運動中，營業南史地的硏究，寧在是太黯淡了。</p>
<p>秘書分雲南界內途程，由川江源，六詔，名類，六險，雲南城　，雲南管內物產，蠻夷風俗，南蠻條敎，南蠻疆界接連諸番夷國名，共凡十卷。書內包括中古時代雲南的民族，歷史，地理，物產，風俗，制度，以及吡連諸番國的問題，極爲複雜。每一個問題都需要作廣博的考證和硏究。關於蠻書應爲專文討論，此處只能就版本內容予以簡單的介紹。（三十六年九月廿六日寫於北平。）　（績完）</p>
<h3>討論誌公十二時的三封信</h3>
<p>— 周一良　胡適</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>有三先生：</p>
<p>昨晚歸來，細譯誌公十二時頌，頗覺其不可信。疑問約有數端，姑爲左右妄言之，尙希諟正。</p>
<p>一，洛陽伽　（記卷二崇眞寺條：「閻羅王云：請經者心懷彼我，以驕凌物，比丘中第一鹿行。今唯試坐禪誦經，不問講經」。又云：「沙門之體，必須攝心守通，志在彈誦」。似乎六朝時已有一派佛敎不主講論，專重　誦。然此處所謂碑仍是安世高以來之小乘蟬觀，與唐以來　宗之不著文字以心傳心者實不相同。傳燈錄所載誌公之大乘贊十二時頌十四科頌三篇，內容大致不異，乃是轡以後之　宗思想。十二時頌之「只守玄，沒文字」以及大乘贊之非難「尋行數墨」，十四科頌眞俗不二篇之議刺講經，看來雖似與伽藍記崇眞寺條相符合，而實非一事。要之：一良頗疑此三篇之思想爲六代時所不能有，至少亦不能發揮如此書致。元念常佛祖歷代通載卷九，謂寶誌「爲學者述大重贊十篇，科誦十四篇並十二時歌。皆暢道幽致，其旨與宗門冥合，今盛傳於世」。蓋亦知其時代不可能，故日「冥合」也。</p>
<p>二，此三篇文字，氣息相通，似不甚早，一良以直覺判斷之，深疑非六代作品，然此點殊難「拿證據來」耳。「祖師」「阿書」二詞，似皆六朝以後始見，惜目前未細檢諸書，不</p>
<p>三，慧皎佾傳卷十保誌傳在神異篇，所載行迹，亦皆神話物語。記誌公者述未言及此三篇，只稱：「時或賦詩，言如義記」。再考他處，如道宣僧傳卷伍法雲傳，簫子顯御講般若經序，（廣弘明集卷一九）梁武帝凈業賦，（同上卷二九）梁書卷三七何敬容傳，陳書卷二六徐陵傳，南史卷七梁書本紀，伽藍記卷四白馬寺條等等，所記實誌事迹，亦無一非與神異或預言有關。似此以神變幻術爲能事之神僧，殊難認爲傳燈錄所收作品之作者也。</p>
<p>四，後代彈宗僧人之所以製作此三篇託諸實誌者，蓋亦有戰。業皎僧傳卷三　良耶舍傳，稱其：「雖三藏兼明，而以繅門專業。每一游觀，或七日不起。……沙門實誌學其禪書。」此節豈即誌公與後代禪宗發生關繫之緣起乎？　皎保誌傳又云：「又問十二之旨，答云：旨在書　時節刻漏中。識者以爲書之在十二時中。」十二時頌或即從此得暗示而撰成　？</p>
<p>要之，一良意十二時頌當　後入假託誌公。唯梁時巳有用十二時爲韻文之體制與否，則未敢質言。因此頌雖僞，而其體裁固不必僞也。然隋書一五音樂志下言隋煬帝「令樂正白明達造新聲，剏萬歲樂……及十二時等曲。……帝……謂幸臣曰：多彈曲者如人多讀書。讀書多則能撰書，彈曲多即能造曲，此理之自然也。」樂曲之十二時曲與此十二時頌定有關係，一良頗疑此種體製實始於隋代也。拉雜作書，敬希不吝指敎。順頌撰安！　弟一良頓首</p>
<p>十一月六日淸華園</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>重民兄：</p>
<p>說十二時，與一良先生信，都讀了。</p>
<p>保誌的十二時歌，與其他問篇，都是好白話，說理很明白。若眞是唐以前　文字，兩部弘明集似乎沒有不收之片。此等歌不收在兩弘明集裏，即可以推知其為晚出之作。</p>
<p>十二時已時歌中說「祖師言」，亥時歌中說「超釋迦，越機代」，子時歌中說「祖師言，外遶事」。此是中唐以後的習語，作僞者不知道歷史，故留此把柄。（下略）</p>
<p>適之　卅六·十一·廿一夜</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>有三我兄：</p>
<p>關於保誌十二時頌，弟猶有一意，前函未及，茲再補充述之。</p>
<p>六朝通例僧人雙名簡稱時只用下一字，如道安之日安和上，　遠之曰遠公，其例比比皆是，然無用上一字者。胡名之漢化亦取下一字，如宇文黑賴或黑　（隋唐人常取爲名之「黑　」當亦此字。）省成宇文泰；高歡胡名賀六渾省成「渾」，復變爲「歡」，賀拔允胡名阿鞠埿而省締賀拔埿，　當時慣例如此。前函所引詻衛法雲傳省稱「誌」，凈業賦稱「誌公」，獨伽　記日「寶公」，則此寶公究是寶誌（或保誌）與否，寶大成問題也。</p>
<p>伽　記之十二辰歌要爲最早見者，或者白明達即采此種體制之歌詞，譜而成曲云？唐代褝宗僧人蓋糅合伽藍記實公十二辰歌與悉皎保誌傳畺良耶舍傳之文，而創出保誌作十二時頌之說，復製成此頌以實之耳。「下略」</p>
<p>弟一良謹上。卅七年一月十八日</p>
<h3>跋四部業刊三編影印本故唐律疏議</h3>
<p>— 王重民</p>
<p>按是書原名律疏，長孫無忌等進表云：「撰律疏三十卷」，又疏云：「與李勣等一十九人撰成律蔬，上表以進」。卷一名例前載疏語，述明「疏」字之義，謂取例羣經義疏，欲兼經注而明之也。所述命名取義，尤爲明白。國唐志　錄並作律疏，宋人稱引亦作律疏，敦煌所出書寫本書題又正題作律疏，皆其明證也。余爲敦煌寫本作跋，曾疑及此，然謂律疏同義，連疏於議，始於宋元人，則猶有未諦。當時余僅見岱南閣翻元本；今見四部業刋三編影印逆惠齊藏宋刻本，律文之後，低一格載疏語，雖同冠「疏議」兩字，元本兩字並作陰文，宋本僅疏字作陰文，議字則連下爲句。此一字陰陽文之差，其能啓余思而助余爲解者甚多。條文爲律，解條文者爲疏，律與疏，猶經與傳。長孫無忌與李勸等十九人所議，皆解釋條文者，皆「疏」也。宋本陰文「疏」字下緊接議日，正是其事。蓋長孫氏等因古者律有議議，故於所討論之文，統冠「議日」兩字；「議曰」以下旣是疏語，故又置於陰文「疏」字以下，其事甚明，其分別至易。敦煌本無疏字，僅作「議日」；因「議曰」所論，置於「疏」之地位，即可望而知其爲疏也。宋本之有陰文疏字，教煌本之無陰文疏字，其義相同，均無差誤。元本將「疏議」並爲陰文，則失原來本義矣。蓋是書原名律疏或唐律疏，對舊本言則於書上加一「故」字，宋本又於末加一「議」字，此由不知「疏」與「議白」原是一事。元人揚宋人之波，將卷內一切「疏議」字速讀，遂成大誤。但數百年來，竟無人覺其誤也。</p>
<p>癸已類稿卷十二唐律疏議跋云：「此書名疏者，申明律及注意；名議者，申律之深義及律所不周不達，若董仲舒春秋決獄，應劭決事比及集駁議之類，亦不知疏議同物，均爲「申明律及注」並「申律之深義及律所不周不達」者也。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>民主第一課</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>久不去公園了，一是因爲天氣太冷，二是這個時候到公園裏去也沒有甚麽可看的，除非是人看人。但因聽說現在的公園已廢棄收票方式，改由遊園人自行投票，所以頗想去看看。因此在前天順便到某公園去轉了一下。</p>
<p>恰値星期日，天氣又好，遊園的人相當多。據我看到的，除了從出口處進去的某一些身份的人外，其餘循序由進口處進去的遊衆，差不多是完全購票而自行撕票投入鐵絲做的字紙簍中的，揩油的人可說很少。</p>
<p>我覺得公園管理當局這一措置是値得贊美的。在歐美各國，多數公園本來是自由開放的，因爲市民納了稅，公園的開支早已列入市政經費範圍之內，就是我國內地，有許多地方的公園也是無需購票的。</p>
<p>上海的公園所以要門票，據我猜想，大概是起於當初「華人與犬不得入內」的一條而來。後來雖然「華人」也得入內了，但當時在洋人主持下的市政當局，猶覺得應予相當限制，於是遊公園便須購票。當時雖然不過一二角錢，但對於那時的「下等華人」，一二角錢也是一儸不小的數目。事實上當時的公園遊客，確也多是不在乎一二角錢的衣冠楚楚之輩。</p>
<p>限制「華人」的原因，恐怕是因爲當時公民敎育猶未普遍，譬如一部份人任意攀折花木，踐踏草地之類，確是不能諱言的事實。就是現在，這類不守公德的現象也還是有的。不過對付這類行爲的方法，與其用強制性的限制，實不若採取誘導性的方針來得有效果。</p>
<p>現在公園的門票制改取自動方法，不妨看做是公園將完全免費開放的先聲。事實上現在花一二千塊錢去玩一次公園，就是乞丐也是能够辦到的事。但這事的意義並不是幾個錢的門票問題，而是一種公民敎育的實騐。</p>
<p>說起自動制，美國應說是最進步的國家，公共街車目動買票制是早已普遍實行的了，現在更有許多經濟食堂和百貨商店，也採取了自動付款制。你上食品舖中去買束西，絕對沒有人會來監視你，祗需你照貨品的標價，按件自動付値即可。像買五分一包的口香糖或一角一包的香烟之類，更設有自動付款交貨的機器。甚至擦皮鞋都有自動機的，你衹需像打公用電話一樣的投入一個分幣（代價相當美金二角），而將皮鞋放在脚踏板上，幾分鐘就給你擦好了。</p>
<p>當然，美國這類的自動制，目的並不在誘導公民道德，而是有其商業目的的。據說自動購貨付値制度可以增加商品的銷路。但這樣的制度必須在公民道德相當高的國家中始能實行，則恐怕也是不容否認的事實。</p>
<p>在我們這裏就有些不同了，禮義廉恥四字雖高踞國際飯店之首，但一部份人仍是以爲能享特權爲光榮。乘白車，看白戲的風氣，大家早已見怪不怪。我想這事也許與廉恥無關，而是輕濟生活的條件使然。然而經濟上並無問題（譬如買一電東票之類）的人往往亦因自己身份的「與衆不同」，而以能揩油爲有面子。</p>
<p>自動制的最大意義是在啓發人的權利與義務觀念，而能懂得權利與義務的關係，才是實行民主的起步。中國實行民主的最大阻碍，就是社會上好享特權的人尙太多。我很希望此後到公園去玩的人，不僅是爲了透一些新鮮的空氣，而且也是去實習民主的第一課。</p>
<h3>世界之小</h3>

<p>今日世界上所製的釘子，大小尺寸共達一千二百種之多。最小的長僅十六分之三英寸，每只重六千份之一盎斯，最大的長達十五英寸（造船用）重二十六盎斯（每磅爲十六盎斯）。大小兩種釘重量之差達十五萬六十倍之多。</p>
<h3>人心思「希」！</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>勝利之初，接收大員到上海來辦理接收工作，弄得不大順限，張恨水先生首先喊出一句口號，呌「人心思英漢」。這口號當然無用再解釋，可是隱藏在這句話後面的是包含着怎樣一個慘痛的敎訓！明已往之不諫，知來者之可追，正是我們應該急起直圖的圭臬，也是倡行民主的國家所應具的風度。在德國軍營區中，同樣有人心思希特勒的想法。</p>
<p>今年初，英美表示將在西部德國建立一共和國，該國將自發貨幣，措置財政，管理國內外商業，領導選舉，總之，從各方面看來，是一個獨立自主的政府。問題是德國已受納粹敎育十二年之久，能否一脚踢開，接受民主生活，倒是疑問。</p>
<p>法國有一本雜誌，名希望（Esprit，搜集到一大批信，原先是不預備發表的，故能暢所欲言。寄信人自大學敎授以至勞工都有，大都對於美國的方法不大關心，而對於希特勒的國社主義表示嚮往之忱。因此紐約出版的雜誌文摘特加轉載，他們不以這種論調爲忤，采及葑菲，民主國家的態度，殊有値得效法之處。雜誌文摘的編者還特加按語；「從這幾封信中看來，如其新德國不是再版的納粹，則美國的再敎育與民主化應該重新起頭並加速進行」云云。</p>
<p>有一封信上承認國社黨有惡劣份子，其行動爲希特勒所反對，但他贊成該黨的紀律，訓練，和明快作風。據說希特勒缺少外交家的材幹，才被迫牽入戰爭。德國人不想作戰，希特勒也不想作戰。</p>

<h3>消遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十一章　滿腹疑雲　（八二）</p>
<p>渚齋如此一想，心氣轉見和平，一早忙着上班，到下班時候，來到綺紈家裏，綺紈巳出門去了，據小王媽說：「今天一淸早，繆處長便來了電話，催請老板前去，老板挨延到下午三點鐘，繆處長派汽車來接，才走了。在老板未走之前，繆處長親打了好幾次電話，後來不知稅了什麼，老板很生氣，把耳機掛上，不理他。看老板的神氣，對這位姓繆的，並不見得十分要好。」渚齋聽了，不由念一聲「阿彌陀佛，但願如此。」小王媽笑道：「徐先生也念起佛來。」渚齋道：「老板認識這位姓繆的，我很是擔心，因爲這種武人，很不好對付，弄到結果，惹得引火燒身，那才不値呢！」小王媽道：「這個，徐先生，你可以勸勸她，再說你二位位的將來，誰不知道，外面這話都傳遍了！」渚齋笑道：「外面怎麽說？」小王媽道：「誰不知老板要和你結婚呀！」渚齋道：「我祇希望中途不要發生變化！」小王媽道：「有什麼變化？」渚齋道：「照昨天和今天的情形看來，我很擔憂。」小王媽遲疑一會，突問道：「徐先生，你和老板結婚的事，家裏知道不知道？」渚齋很驚異地問道：「你這話是什麽意思？」小王媽很想把前天毓如曾來找綺紈的話，吿訴渚齋，一想又怕其中別有緣故，綺紈不許說，便又忍住不說，略一遲疑，笑道：「沒什麼，我想這樣婚姻大事，你家裏老太爺一定早知道了，」渚齋也只好順口應這：「當然早知道了！」小王媽道：「你這幾天有和那位章小姐來往嗎？老板常說童小姐是大學生，她不如她。」渚齋道：「我好久沒和她在一起了。」小王媽道：「那就沒什麼事，這都是我多心。」說着又笑了一笑，把身子望後一退，讓開路，由渚齋出來。渚齋經了小王媽這幾句話，心裏陡起疑雲，細細一想，要和綺紈結婚的事，家事是絕對不知道的，就是雲卿和鳳笙，也絕對不會想到。</p>
<h3>不醉術</h3>
<p>— 宇文土</p>
<p>怎樣可以喝酒不醉？筆者經過若干次的試騐，獲得結論如下：（地）獨飲—量的多少和時間久暫隨心所欲，不受聚衆轟飲時的强迫與牽制，適可而止，必不至於弄得狼藉不堪虐待自己又虐待別人。（二）絕思—濟進愁腸，表面興奮，其實裏外不協調，矛盾尖銳化，痛苦益深，智者不取，是故細味杯中三昧時，切忌轉念頭，動腦筋。（三）避色—此處所云「色」，意指極容易破壞飲者「酒格」的女人。她一旦置身在旁，庸碌者不必說，即使明哲之士也往往忽略了酒的價値，不知不覺間糟塌掉好多珍貴的瓊漿玉液。</p>
<p>你若要飲而不醉，常保淸明，以上是不妨一試的騐方。</p>
<p>另外一人從柏林來信，以爲德國唯一的錯誤是革命時流血不多，蘇聯革命時代淸算掉所有的敵人，法國則有斷頭臺。而在希特勒時代，一切都極順利。失業狀態消失，沒有低新給，全國恢復秩序。結束時承認希特勒在某幾方面的行動是錯誤的。</p>
<p>有一個反納粹的德國人，在集中營裏住過六年，信上表示只見勝利之後，著名納粹分子不但不坐牢監，反而位居要津。德國人在公開談論下一次戰事，只要盟軍一旦離開德國，老納粹精神會立刻重興。德國總有一天重處作戰地位。他的結論是豹皮上的斑點決不會有變化。</p>
<p>有的人反問其他國家有無錯誤行爲，有無集中營？他認爲德國只是一個廣大的懲罰營，但種恨苗者決不能收穫親愛之果。有的人認爲征服者將奪取德國人的機會，德國人的生產並非爲他們自己，都是爲了別人辛苦。有一工人說，希特勒要我們做好納粹，美國人要我們做好民主，也許明天蘇聯人要我們做好共產。蘇聯以後的事呢……天曉得！</p>
<p>以上云云，可當「民隱」看，英法當局肯勒求民隱，使有則改之，無則加勉，王天下之大道，其在斯乎？</p>
<h3>吃談</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>你曾經想過嗎，是甚麽人發明吃蚶子的？我們怎麼會吃起海蜇皮來？，對於這類問題，現在也許沒有人能回答了。</p>
<p>人類吃的習慣，是隨着時代和地域而不同的。有一個時候，我們的祖先，除了有毛的動物以外，甚麼都不吃。至今有許多魄方人的美食，外地人聽起來，總覺得駭人聽聞。</p>
<p>美國俄利岡州人，有嗜食響尾蛇者，說是有一種猪肉和鷄肉混在一起的味道。而法蘭四人，則認爲天下美味，莫逾於蝸牛了。你當然聽說過，有的地方的人，是愛吃老鼠的。（編者按雲南多鼠，戰時潘光且先生任敎西南聯大，初亦以多鼠爲患，後乃一秉「勤捉」原則，頗有鹵獲，遂「紅燒」若干頭，以饗學生，學生初不知所食何物，羣相歎羨，謂潘師母治鷄雛特佳云。）</p>
<p>古代人所吃的東西，有許多是現代人認爲不能吃的。比如設，羅馬人吃毛蟲，認爲賽似杏仁。凱撤時代的老饕，喜歡吃白糖牛油煎螞蟻。他們還喜歡吃蜘蛛，鸚鵡舌和鴕鳥肉。</p>
<p>歐洲人最早吃馬鈴薯（洋山芋）是十六世紀末葉的事。第一個吃的，是一個呌做湯瑪斯哈里奧特的英國人，他是想用馬鈴薯自殺的。那是一五八四年，哈里奧特探險美洲歸來，想起他苦戀的一個女孩子，而無法擺脫。於是煮了一個印第安人種植的馬鈴薯，因爲據說此物極毒，吃了可以斃命。結果他並沒有死。馬鈴薯有毒之說，也就打破了。</p>
<p>今日人們稱爲富於雜他命ABC的番茄，從前也被認爲極毒之物，是在一八三四年，有一位老奶奶，試過種種方法。不能治好她病瘦的孫兒，於是就遞給他一只番茄。相傳這就是人類吃番茄之始。</p>
<p>最早發現吃咖啡的，據僡是一頭阿比亞尼亞的驢子，時當査理曼大帝之際。這匹驢子的主人發現，每當經過一座山脚時，無論怎樣踢牠抽牠，這匹驢也不肯走動一步，除非讓牠把生在山脚的一種灌木吃一個飽。而牠在吃飽之後，精神百倍，却又非得踢牠，抽牠，才能使牠停下來。最後，這個驢主人發現山脚下的灌木上結有果實，他嚼了嚼覺得味美而有刺激性。後來西半球的人早已煮咖啡喝了，探險家仍發現阿比西尼亞人在嚼咖啡實。</p>
<h3>西北的青城與龍山（下）</h3>
<p>— 君左</p>
<p>跨過雲龍橋登與龍山。上這一座高山只有一條平闊的大路，坡度灣度都比棲雲山平坦。過雲龍橋龍王廟，廟北一小屋，也供着悟元子的神像，粉裝玉琢，像一個洋娃娃，與棲雲戰像大不相同。又有一尊孔子像，粉面綸巾像諸葛亮的化身。遍觀東西兩山泥塑，沒有一具有藝術的價値，而此二山本身不愧西北名山，只要有一尊像角直的唐塑，便爲兩山生色不淺。由龍王廟南上，旁有小神洞，再上爲玉液泉，水由石縫中出，積成一井，水淸冽無比。泉在關帝廟走廊中，龐左有石菩薩殿，右樓爲關帝殿，由此東上坡，有靈官殿三楹，再上爲菩薩殿，殿後磚牆上，嵌有漢譯的成吉思汗遺囑，文云：「廣土衆民欲禦侮，必合衆心爲一。」這句名言，永遠成爲一個國家爭生存的原理。由菩薩殿右上爲太白宮，即有名的成陵——成吉思汗的陵寢。成陵係於民國二十八年夏間中央准沙王的建議，由綏遠伊克昭盟伊金霍洛移來興龍山太白宮暫厝。太白宮一名大佛殿，房屋齊整，但並不寬敞，且漸頺敗，曠代英雄，冷落荒丘，憑弔之下，感喟無窮。謁陵，由一個蒙古司事者引導參觀，入殿，首先鞠躬致敬。殿上幕以黄布，中間兩旁遍置花圈絕聯和匾額，中縣成吉思汗汕畫像一幅，其像　魁偉而剛毅，令人肅然起敬。　前爲成吉思汗的銀棺，長一二〇公分，寬七七公分，厚九九五公分。棺週嵌以黄金雕琢的圖案，滿鑲珍珠寶玉，上覆彩綢多幅——每年三月十八日大祭時加上一幅。銀棺前面置照像一幀，是攝自石碑上面的。成吉思汗銀棺左旁，有他的妃子福晋銀棺一具，長一〇〇公分，寬六〇公分，厚七〇公分，其形式裝飾，和成棺一樣。在成吉思汗銀棺中，係與他的皇后合葬，均係骨灰，殉葬珍物及其生平衣冠都納入這銀棺裏。他的皇后妃子都沒有畫相，想來一定賢慧而姣美。成妃靈櫬前面有一個朱漆的小木箱，上置紅木雕花的方鏡一面，長四二公分，寬三二公分，鏡面平滑而厚，影像淸晰，是成吉思汗西征時由歡洲帶回來贈給牠作梳粧用的，英雄美人，照耀千古。殿右置鋼矛一柄，閃閃放銀光，矛長二〇公分，柄長二·五〇公尺，外裏黄綢，上統黑毛，是成吉思汗生前用以親征的武器，還留傳一段神話——成吉思汗有一次被圍，禱吿上蒼，忽有長矛自天而降，即上而所說的這一柄，可是這柄長矛緩緩不落地面，經過這一代英雄的虔誠的懇求，直到最後勝敗的關頭，才落到他的手中，而發揮了無比的神力，縱横歐亞。矛頭黑毛一大圈，又多又厚傳說是人的頭髮。成吉思汗打仗，殺人一個拔頭髮一根，繫於矛上，有多少根頭髮，即殺了多少個人。這柄鋼矛，現在的人起碼要五六個人才抬得動。鋼矛豎在一張方桌後面，桌上放一個方形木匣，上置寶劍一口，長八〇公分，柄長二〇公分，是成吉思汗生前的佩劍。另外，壁上縣有弓一把，大小不合矛與劍的比例，恐係配物。出太白宮旁門上坡爲藥王廟，再上爲三聖母殿，住着守陵的蒙古人。循路再上，路旁有三敎洞，洞左右建屋數楹，三敎洞原來在三聖母廟下灣，現移此地有一段神話：三敎洞舊址偏僻簡陋，年深日久，半淪傾圯，無人去燒香。到了淸道光九年三月間，山中突然來一隻鳩形小島，往來飛鳴，聲甚悲傷，其音似專呼三教洞，歷時三年，未嘗飛離，老道鄉農都不知道是一種什麽鳥類，後來有一個羽士名金敎立，一日凝神靜坐，忽有所悟，云此島必係三教王的靑島專使，呼聲三敎洞，是呌人重修；於是這位羽士，大發善願，四出募化，將三敎洞改建於今址，工竣以後，鳥就寂然，不知往了。據我想：我住育城山時，有一種奇島名木魚哥哥，入夜悲鳴，達且始輟，擾人淸夢，興龍山也許有這種鳥，羽士籍此募化，建築廟宇，用心良苦。從三敎洞南上甚近即抵太白泉，原名三元泉，淸咸豐年間才改今名。泉在太白樓下，所謂太白，不是李太白的太白，而是太白金星的太白。泉由石縫中出，一左一右，以石槽導入水櫃，櫃上舖木板，櫃底前端，開有三個小孔，分注於櫃前三個圓洞內。洞前有一半月形的水池，以盛洞中注入的泉水。在殿前石階下，置一圓形石槽，槽上箭前，有石龍頭一個，水由龍口吐入權中，從這石槽裏，又　一小孔，將水引注於殿前的深淵中。此泉淸冽如鏡，味甘而美。水底積着很多小石子，據說：凡求子的人，只要上樓向太白金星磕頭哀求後，下樓將手深深摸到洞中一顆小石子，交給太太，就可連生貴子。太白泉之可愛，不純爲它有着淸冽甘美的泉水，乃在可以遠跳馬鞍山秀麗的景色，近接棲雲山旖旎的風光。此泉正殿兩旁，各有廂房三間，凈几明窗，爲眺望山色最佳勝處。可是太白泉的道士貧苦得眞可憐，廚房中除粗麵及鹽巴外，前無食物，山茶雖另有風味，究嫌苦澀。故遊太白泉者必自携食品，可在此地廚房烹煮。興龍棲雲馬鞍諸山全部的景色投射到太白泉，遊山人士，到此大可盤桓，品茶飲酒，高歌賦詩，一切皆宜。四山多白雲，白雲無盡期，看雲景也以太白泉爲第一。遊興龍山，必到太白泉。談到名蹟，只有于右任院長書題的一塊「太白泉」小石碑而已。</p>
<p>總之，興龍樓雲兩山最大的特色是森林茂盛，幾人合抱的古杉古松，觸目皆是。兩高峯間夾一小河急流的清溪，淸溪上跨一美麗的臥橋尤富畫意詩情。這不僅是西北的名山，即放在中國名山中亦毫無愧色。而它的一切型態絕似靑城，至於全山構造的圖案美則靑城尙有不及之處。從蘭州坐汽車來往遊玩，一日之內，從從容容。</p>

<h3>Minister Bai Reports on Military Situation: Northeast Strategy Will Never Change; War in Yingkou Approaching City; Division Commander Li Executed in Shenyang for Abandoning Duty</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, at the State Council meeting on the 27th, reported on the military situation and reviewed the Northeast war, stating: The authorities' strategy for the Northeast will never change, maintaining the existing situation as the principle. The government must defend the Northeast to protect the North.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] The battle of Yingkou reached its climax on the morning of the 26th. The communist bandits suffered heavy casualties under our repeated attacks. After fierce fighting at the railway station and the north bank of the Liao River, the war is now approaching the city.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] The National Army in Goubangzi began sweeping north on the 26th, and Zhaojiatun is now under control. The vanguard of the National Army entering from Shanhaiguan has reached Jinzhou. The communist bandits in Faku are moving towards Kaiyuan. Another force of 20,000 is moving towards the north bank of the Liao River, showing signs of approaching Xinmin.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 27th] Heavy forces from both the Nationalists and Communists are engaged in fierce fighting in Yingkou. After capturing Anshan, the Communists have invaded southern Yingkou. National Army reinforcements from the sea are "fighting fiercely." Recent reports indicate that the communist troops attacking Xinmin have been repelled by the National Army, with the Communists suffering the loss of two divisions, details unknown. Two National Army divisions have been transferred from the south and have landed in Qinhuangdao.</p>

<h3>North Korea Assists Communist Rebellion; Military Conference Jointly Held in Pyongyang; 30,000 Korean Troops Sent to Northeast to Join War</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, this city dispatch] High-level intelligence sources stated on the 27th that Soviet-controlled North Korea has jointly formed a military conference with the Chinese Communists. The source revealed the contents of a certain report, stating: The location of the military conference is in Pyongyang, North Korea. Due to its activities, "Soviet assistance to the Communist armies in the Northeast provinces has been definitely confirmed. The joint military conference is more active than all communist liaison organizations, responsible for coordinating the activities of three major command headquarters, including troop movements and maintenance of logistics." The report further stated: The weapons and ammunition of the Japanese army stationed in Korea at the time of victory have been transferred to the Chinese Communists. "An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Korean troops have been sent to the nine eastern provinces, assisting the Chinese Communists through the power of the joint military conference headquarters in Pyongyang." It is learned that wounded communist troops "have been transferred to North Korea for treatment." The Chinese Communists "trade rubber shoes for food from the Northeast." "When the North Korean People's Army was formed, the Soviet Red Army armed it with Japanese equipment captured at the end of the war. Last summer, all the Japanese equipment suddenly disappeared, and the People's Army switched to Soviet weapons, and its uniforms were similar to those of the Red Army. The Japanese equipment then fell into the hands of the Chinese Communists." The report estimates that the number of Japanese who surrendered to the American army was around 179,000, and the number who surrendered to the Soviet army was even higher. "Therefore, the joint military conference has sufficient resources and can equip at least 15 divisions of the Chinese Communist army with the Japanese weapons captured in North Korea." It is said that the Koreans sent to China "are deployed between Jilin and the Korean border, under the command of the Chinese Communists, mostly serving in transportation and service roles." The report also stated: Generally, it is not believed that the Korean army "has participated in actual combat. The reason why they appear in the Northeast is generally believed to be to train the Chinese Communist army in combat and to protect both sides of the Chinese Communist Northeast front." According to related reports, the National Army has encountered the Korean army on the battlefield. The report believes: "That batch of Korean troops may have been living with the Eighth Route Army for a long time, but they are not among the 30,000 sent to the Northeast by the joint military conference in May last year."</p>

<h3>Central Government Decides to Allocate Increased Local Self-Defense Force Expenses; Revenue From Increased Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes to Be Used to Offset Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The increased expenses for local self-defense forces were discussed at the State Council meeting on the 27th, and it was resolved that all expenses would be allocated by the central government and would not be raised by the local governments. It has been learned that the central government's method of increasing the source of funds mainly lies in increasing taxes and increasing revenue from domestic tobacco and alcohol taxes to fill it, and amending Article 2 of the draft regulations on domestic tobacco and alcohol taxes to implement it first. At the same time, please set the tax rates for tobacco and alcohol taxes as follows: A. Tobacco taxes are divided into two types: tobacco leaves and tobacco shreds. Tobacco counties assess and determine the duty-paid price according to the production area and collect 60%, and tobacco shreds are 70%. B. Alcohol taxes are collected at 100% of the assessed tax price according to the production area. The total amount of increased taxes for items A and B is estimated to be around 400 billion yuan in five months. C. For the salt tax portion, industrial salt is not taxed, salt for fishery use is increased by 50,000 yuan per dan, and the national table salt is uniformly increased by 70,000 yuan per dan starting from February. It is estimated that it can increase revenue by 1.5 trillion yuan in five months. In addition, out of the relief expenditure in the national general budget for the first half of the year, 2 trillion yuan will be allocated for suppressing rebellion and restoring order, and it is planned to spend 1.7 trillion yuan. Combining the above three totals 3.6 trillion, which is enough to pay for the expenses of the self-defense forces.</p>
<h3>Taft and Bridges Advocate Special Appropriations for Military Aid to China; Allocation of Over 270 Million at Once</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Prominent Republican Senators Taft and Bridges today advocated that Congress allocate 275 million US dollars at one time to provide military assistance to China. This amount is equal to the amount that Secretary of State Marshall requested in a letter to the speakers of the House and Senate yesterday to continue aid to Greece and Turkey. According to the two senators, they will try to allocate funds to supply arms to the Chinese government to combat the Communist Party when the Senate discusses the new bill to aid Greece and Turkey. Taft is currently the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, and Bridges is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and is of great importance to government expenditure issues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] According to Senator Vandenberg, Marshall reiterated his proposal for a limited economic plan under the $570 million aid to China plan during a secret meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for more than two hours today. Marshall refused to discuss this meeting with reporters and refused to release any details of the meeting. Marshall's discussion in the above committee today was the same as his discussion in the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week. In last week's meeting, his statement was consistent with his current position.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Secretary of State Marshall declared today that China has asked the United States for a stabilization currency loan in addition to the $570 million aid package.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Japanese Military Equipment</h3>
<p>Content of Resolutions Passed by the Far Eastern Commission</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Reports at State Council Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on diplomatic affairs at the State Council meeting on the 27th, including the case of the prohibition of Japanese military affairs passed by the Far Eastern Commission in February this year. The content of the case includes two parts: the prohibition of Japanese military activities and the disposal of Japanese military equipment. Confiscated Japanese weapons, only police can wear short guns and hunting guns, and the rest cannot be used. The disposal of Japanese military equipment stipulates that all military education in schools must be cancelled, and military ships that have been converted into ships must not be changed back into warships.</p>
<h3>US Revises Far East Policy; Sends Strategist Kennan to Japan for Investigation; Will Also Study Situation in Northern China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The United States is currently re-examining its Far East policy and has dispatched George Kennan, Chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, to Japan to undertake special duties studying the situation in that region. Secretary of State Marshall announced today that Kennan has departed for Japan to investigate the situation in Japan and to confer with General MacArthur. Although Secretary Marshall did not reveal the specifics of Kennan's itinerary, US officials told a Central News Agency reporter that the Chairman of the State Department Policy Planning Staff (referring to Kennan) will also study the situation in North China and the communist issues in Korea during this trip to the Far East. However, Secretary Marshall only acknowledged that Kennan's mission is related to the future peace treaty with Japan, and said he does not know whether Kennan will visit China or how long he will stay in Japan. Kennan plans to return home via the Philippines. When asked if Kennan's mission is related to the recently announced US policy of assisting Japan's economic recovery to a self-sufficient basis, Secretary Marshall replied that Kennan will study this particular issue during his stay in Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, United Press] Senior US officials told United Press reporters that Secretary Marshall's action in sending Kennan, a senior advisor on foreign policy, to Japan, is a prelude to the United States' intention to drastically change its policy towards Japan and to strive to build Japan into a fortress to prevent Soviet expansion in the Far East. It is said that the United States has decided to abandon its position of punishing Japan, as advocated in the Potsdam Conference, and is now striving to restore Japan's economic prosperity so that it can become a fortress in Asia to resist communism. General MacArthur has long held this view. It is said that, in addition to this fundamental reason, it is hoped that Kennan's trip will also quell some people's comments on the US government's neglect of the Far East due to its concern for the European situation. The decision to send Kennan to Japan was reached at a policy meeting last week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] United Press learned on the 27th from authoritative sources that China's general attitude towards Japan, especially on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, has undergone a drastic change, and is almost completely aligned with US policy. According to the position announced by the Chinese government in April last year, it was the same as the Soviet Union's attitude. At that time, the government declared that if the Soviet Union did not attend the peace conference, China would not participate either. The current new attitude of China is in sharp contrast to the previous position. The person who instigated this change is Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who is "slow and steady," and the reason for this shift is that the threat of communism to China and the world is increasing.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Starting from the Czech Coup</h3>
<p>After several days of brewing, the Czech political upheaval has resulted in President Beneš, who believed in liberal democracy and followed a center-left path, finally succumbing to external pressure and internal threats. He accepted the resignations of the People's Social Party, the People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party cabinet members, and approved the list of communist cabinet members proposed by Prime Minister Gottwald. Although the new cabinet still maintains the appearance of a "coalition government," the power is completely in the hands of the Czech Communist Party, and the new cabinet has already announced that a rectification movement will be implemented in every public institution throughout the country to eliminate those who oppose the government. Therefore, this cabinet reshuffle in Czechoslovakia is not only a change in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs, but its impact is enough to affect the overall world situation. Its significance is really not to be ignored.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is overjoyed at the Czech Communist Party's seizure of power, which goes without saying. As Kaufman, an English commentator for Moscow Radio, said: "The Czech people have shown a high degree of political activity, and the reactionaries obviously did not expect the unity of the masses to be so strong." This statement can represent the Soviet side's view. But on the other hand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France issued a joint declaration condemning the Czech communists' seizure of power, stating that "establishing a one-party dictatorship under the guise of a coalition government can only lead to great disasters for the Czech people," and that this political upheaval "endangers the existence of the principles of freedom cherished by all democratic countries." The United States may go further and take economic sanctions against the Czech communist regime. According to senior US officials, four measures may be taken: (1) the US Export-Import Bank will cancel the plan to grant Czechoslovakia a $20 million cotton loan; (2) the Treasury Department will freeze all Czech government assets in the United States; (3) the US representative to the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development will oppose Czechoslovakia's proposed reconstruction loan; and (4) the US representative to the International Monetary Fund will oppose Czechoslovakia's loan application. From this, it can be seen that although the Czech political upheaval has now come to an end, its consequences are enough to cause a great international political storm.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia, as a country, emerged after the First World War. But geographically, it is located in the center of Europe. Everyone knows the truth that "whoever can control Czechoslovakia can control Europe." Therefore, if Nazi Germany wanted to expand outwards, it had to invade Czechoslovakia; the scene in Munich is an excellent example. At the same time, Czechoslovakia has a congenital defect, that is, Czechoslovakia is composed of two different ethnic groups, who quarrel with each other endlessly. Therefore, although the people ideologically tend towards democracy, and the domestic industrialization is also better than other neighboring countries, Czechoslovakia seems destined to fail. Before the First World War, Czechoslovakia became a vassal of Nazi Germany; by the end of the Second World War, President Beneš was able to rebuild Czechoslovakia, and a beautiful illusion floated before him again, seeming to be able to lead Czechoslovakia towards a democratic, social, and independent path. But for the past two and a half years, President Beneš has been trapped in a complex international political circle and has fallen into an abyss of depression. For the sake of Czechoslovakia's own needs, he needs raw materials and energy from the East on the one hand, and capital and machinery from the West on the other hand. However, the political shadows from both the East and the West are threatening the middle path he is taking. Although he longed for American material assistance, he never accepted it frankly; although he feared the infiltration of Soviet forces, he was ultimately unable to resist it! Now, the political line has changed, and the middle path has come to an end. President Beneš, who is regarded as the highest leader of the Czech nation, will soon announce his resignation! The end of those who take the middle path is truly a tragedy for Czech democracy and a blow to the prospects for world peace. The Czech Communist Party's style is like this, and the style of the communist parties in any country in the world is also like this. A lesson can be learned from the Czech tragedy: the idea of ​​cooperation and coexistence with the Communist Party is impossible; if you are not careful, you will suffer the Czech democratic tragedy!</p>
<p>The occurrence of this Czech political upheaval is not only a showdown between the various Czech parties, but also forcing the Western democratic countries to have a showdown soon. In order to make it easier for readers to understand, it is necessary to start with Secretary of State Marshall's proposal of the European aid plan.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Marshall Plan is nothing more than to use the United States' vast financial and material resources to assist the economic reconstruction of European countries, so that they do not fall into a state of chaos and be dominated by totalitarians. Objectively speaking, Marshall's motives are good and proper, and could have won the broad sympathy of all countries in the world. However, while the US aid plan to Europe is still being debated, it has aroused the Soviet Union's infinite fears and revulsion. The emergence of the new communist international in Eastern Europe, the formation of the Balkan bloc, the strengthening of the economic institutions in eastern Germany, and even this coup in Czechoslovakia are all a series of dramas directed by the Soviet Union behind the scenes. We have already said above that Czechoslovakia needs and desires American material assistance, but under external pressure, Czechoslovakia declared its withdrawal. Threatened by the domestic Communist Party, Czechoslovakia completely threw itself into the arms of the Eastern European bloc. This cannot but be said to be a major change for Czechoslovakia and a major obstacle to the US aid plan to Europe.</p>
<p>Judging from the Czech coup, the anti-Marshall Plan movement led by the Soviet Union has already taken the lead in terms of timing and efficiency. Looking back at the United States, the Marshall Plan is still in the stage of debate in Congress. What is the total amount? When will it be implemented? All of these are unknown. After this warning, the United States may strengthen the implementation of the Marshall Plan and promote the economic unity of Western European countries. But in any case, the United States will inevitably be at a disadvantage in its diplomatic war with the Soviet Union. Although both the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan use anti-communism as slogans, in action, they are either slow or not thorough. The Truman Doctrine has not only not been promoted to the Far East, but it has not been implemented in Europe either; Czechoslovakia has issued a warning to the United States, can the United States afford to make the same mistake again and again? Can we still stand by and watch the rampant communist parties in various countries and allow them to spread? It is time for the United States to review its foreign policy.</p>

<h3>New Plan for the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters; Preparing to Organize People's Salvation Vanguard Team</h3>
<p>Training One Million Local Cadres</p>
<p>Talented People Returning to Hometowns with the Army to Work</p>
<p>[This newspaper's North China Dispatch on the 27th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Government jointly discussed the issue of talented people and model cadres returning to their hometowns with the Hebei Provincial Association of Fellow Provincials on the 26th. It is said that the Suppression Headquarters plans to complete the organization and training of 1 million local cadres in the five provinces of North China within only half a year. The name is the "People's Salvation Vanguard Team." Each county will select talented people and begin training immediately, dividing them into several teams. Each team will have 2,200 people. The integration of training and work is called "Talented People Going to the Countryside." The Hebei Provincial Government is also drastically reducing staff, and those who remain will also be sent to the countryside. Another slogan in Hebei Province is "Funds Going to the Countryside." Following this policy, a new land policy will be implemented. The original landlords in the newly recovered areas who have family members working with the army will retain two-thirds of their original land; otherwise, only enough land to make a living will be returned. The rest will be distributed to members of the People's Salvation Vanguard Team to support their families, because most of these team members will be refugees from the unrecovered areas. It is estimated that the special self-defense tax of 2,300 yuan per month will also be the main funding for "going to the countryside." Gao Can, the Suppression Headquarters staff member representing Fu Zuoyi, relayed Fu Yuanchuan's opinion, saying that if the military, government, party, and people are in step, refugees in places like Beijing and Tianjin can return to their hometowns within at most a year and a half.</p>
<h3>Report of British Trade Mission to China Released</h3>
<p>Mission Leader Bowes Broadcasts to China</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 27th] The report of the British Trade Mission to China has been released. Sir Bowes, the head of the mission, gave a speech to China on the Far East program of the British Broadcasting Corporation on the afternoon of the 26th. He said that the basic conclusion of the trade mission is that China's greatest need in economic and other aspects is peace. The members of the trade mission witnessed how internal strife is eroding China's manpower and material resources, and they still heard the sounds of war. Productivity is destroyed, and important transportation routes have been destroyed. The members of the trade mission felt this deeply. Unless peace is achieved first, the enthusiastic cooperation of Chinese and foreign politicians, farmers, industrialists, and merchants will fail in their efforts to make China cooperate with the development of world trade and prosperity.</p>
<h3>Jing Panshi Receives Reporters</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) The delayed US aid is related to our country's poor international propaganda. There are not many communist propaganda personnel in the United States, but whether they run newspapers or engage in other activities, they are much better than our government officials. Today, all major countries pay great attention to propaganda work. There are often about 3,000 well-known British people traveling and working in the United States. The Soviet Union also does not relax its propaganda to the United States. On one occasion, it was willing to pay a high price of US$100,000 for a 15-minute broadcast. Jing Panshi reported on the activities of the World Christian Leadership Association, saying that the association was formed by the merger of the two religious groups in the US and Chinese parliaments and has now expanded into an international organization. The purpose is to enable personnel at all levels in the governments of various countries to become exemplary Christians in order to improve society and further seek world peace. The General Assembly was established in Washington in January 1947. Zhou Yide is the representative of the United States. The chief representative of the United Kingdom is William, a veteran of the naval community. He served as an advisor to British Prime Minister Churchill at the Giant Conference. The Canadian representative is Judge Kellogg of the Supreme Court of Canada. Other attending representatives from various countries are also well-known people. Jing Panshi represents my country's attendance. The association has now decided to establish the Far East Council, which will be chaired by Jing Panshi. The address of the association may be set in Shanghai. As for the address of the Chinese branch, it will be set in the capital. Jing Panshi will visit Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing in the next few days and ask for her assistance in finding an address for the association.</p>

<h3>Food in Hankou Being Hoarded; Executive Headquarters Orders Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 27th] The soaring food prices in Wuhan have caused deep concern from all parties. After thorough investigations and discussions by relevant parties in recent days, the following developments have been made: (1) Sun Jiji, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, solemnly announced that he had received an order from the Executive Headquarters stating that the wife of a senior official of a certain high-level organization had recently colluded with the China Food Corporation in Hankou, falsely purchasing large quantities of food under the pretext of purchasing military food, and transporting it to Nanjing and Shanghai for sale and profit. A thorough investigation has been launched based on the report. Sun also learned that a small number of grain merchants often falsely used the names of government personnel to purchase food here on a large scale. A strict investigation is now underway. If this is true, no matter whether it is a false claim, they will be investigated and punished without regard to personal relationships.

They killed more than 100 bandit leaders, including Wang Dahan, injured more than 40 bandits, and captured 60 bandits. Among them, Wang Xiaoqiu's troops surrendered on the 10th of this month, with more than 80 men and guns. Half of them were incorporated into the Baxi Self-Defense Force, and half were sent back to farming. After the main force of Huang's bandits was fiercely suppressed by the First Security Regiment, they also sought to reform. The province ordered them to gather in Jiyang to await orders. On the 23rd of this month, a team was sent to count them, and a total of seven machine guns, more than 100 rifles, and more than 736 rounds of ammunition were collected. All the bandits were sent back to their homes. The long-standing major problem has now been resolved.</p>

<h3>Expansion of Communist Forces Knows No Bounds; The Soviet Union Applies High Pressure on Finland; Suggests Conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: Helsinki, Finland Report, today Finnish President Paasikivi received a concise letter from Stalin, in which he suggested that the Soviet Union and Finland sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. The president convened a meeting of leaders from various parties at the presidential palace this afternoon to discuss countermeasures. Well-informed political sources believe that the Soviet Union advocates a military alliance with Finland, but all parties except the Communist Party are afraid that they will not agree to accept it. It is expected that the Finnish president will try to limit the scope of the agreement so that its nature becomes a joint resistance to any possible German aggression.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Washington Report, State Department experts predict that the Soviet Union's steps to "consolidate" the East will be to incorporate several satellite countries into the Soviet Union. This action may be required after the spring elections in some countries (such as Czechoslovakia) and Finland is completely under Communist control. In addition, France and Italy will also be the main targets of Communist Party activities this spring.</p>
<p>[United Press Helsinki, Finland, 27th Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Finland has received a proposal from the Soviet government to conclude a Soviet-Finnish treaty, but it is not yet known whether the nature of the treaty is friendship, mutual assistance, or both. Since the success of the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, rumors have been rife here that government officials from the Soviet Union and Finland are conducting negotiations on "new developments in relations between the two countries." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that the president received a personal letter from a senior Soviet official yesterday, in which the Soviet side's new plan was explained. According to well-informed sources in diplomatic circles, the president convened a meeting of external affairs officials at his official residence yesterday, and then met with other government officials. The Speaker of the National Assembly also paid a visit to the president in the evening to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 26th Dispatch] Germany under Hitler's rule expanded its power outward before the war, restricting more than 100,000 square miles of land and more than 28 million people in neighboring countries. Since World War II, the Soviet Union and the Communist government have also expanded more than 200,000 square miles in Europe and the East, with their power reaching 110 million people. The scope of Communist power has far exceeded that of the Tsarist era. Czechoslovakia is the most recent country to fall into the Communist camp, but it may not be the last. The Kremlin is also paying close attention to Turkey, Italy, France, Finland, as well as East Germany and Austria. Up to now, more than 200,000 square miles of land and more than 24 million people have been incorporated into the Soviet Union during and after the war. Estonia and Lithuania were first absorbed in 1940. Two-fifths of Poland's pre-war territory, parts of Finland, Romania, Germany and the Czech Republic, have also been occupied by the Soviet Union. Japan's Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island have also been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Since the surrender of Germany and Japan, the westward advance of Communist forces has accelerated. Southern, Albanian, Polish, Bulgarian, Romanian, and Hungarian countries have been controlled by the Communist Party one after another, and now Czechoslovakia has followed. The area of the above countries reaches 440,000 square miles, with a total population of approximately 87 million people.</p>
<h3>Marshall Asks Congress to Allocate Funds; To Provide Further Assistance to Greece and Turkey; Needs 275 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 26th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall sent a letter to House Speaker Martin and Senate Speaker Vandenberg today, on behalf of President Truman, proposing a bill to increase the allocation of 275 million US dollars to provide military assistance to Greece and Turkey. Congress passed a 400 million dollar aid to Turkey and Greece bill last May, and the funds are almost exhausted. If no additional funds are allocated, US aid to the two countries will end at the end of June this year. If the new bill is approved, it can continue to supply guns, ammunition, and medicines until the end of June next year. Marshall also said that if the United States stops providing assistance, totalitarian groups will take the opportunity to take over the regimes of the two countries. I believe that helping these free nations maintain their freedom is undoubtedly in our own interests and consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Turkey is currently under constant pressure, forcing it to cede military bases in the Dardanelles Strait and part of its territory to a certain country. As for other European countries, they have effectively increased their food, coal, and steel production and will be able to implement self-help under the European Recovery Program.</p>
<h3>British Will Reconsider the Recognition of the Government; Currently in Contact with the United States and France</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 26th Dispatch] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the Czech government was established through undemocratic means, so Britain will have to reconsider its recognition of the Czech government. Britain is currently in contact with the governments of the United States and France and is paying close attention to the Czech situation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 26th Dispatch] According to responsible sources, the trade negotiations planned between Britain and the Czech Republic have been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Our Government is Concerned About the Development of the Situation in the Czech Republic</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said; We are very concerned about the coup in the Czech Republic. Deputy Minister Liu Shishun summoned the Czech Ambassador to China Li Like on the afternoon of the 26th to inquire about it. Our ambassador to the Czech Republic has not yet reported to Nanjing on this matter. We are closely monitoring the political situation in the Czech Republic and the development of international relations caused by the coup.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] A certain authoritative person recently commented on the Czech coup, saying, "This is exactly the same as the changes in Austria and the Czech Republic before World War II. The difference is that in the former, the Nazis invaded from outside, while this time it was done by the Czech Communists." He believes that the seizure of power in the Czech Republic by the Communist Party is the closure of the Eastern European curtain. Because the Czech Republic has a developed industry, a high standard of living for its people, and a strong democratic and free atmosphere, it has been holding up under the red chains for more than two years, but it still cannot avoid succumbing to force, which is a great tragedy. He also predicted that the retention of President Benes and Foreign Minister Masaryk is a means of the Czech Communist Party, and the two will eventually be driven out of the government. If Western European countries have no effective remedy for this tragic defeat of democracy, the next target of the ambitious will be Italy, and Italy, which Mussolini sowed the seeds of dictatorship, is actually more fragile than the Czech Republic. He concluded, "In today's world situation, whether in the East or the West, democracy has encountered a serious test again. Raising vigilance is a necessary condition to reverse the decline." When asked by reporters whether the economic strength of the United States, including foreign aid plans, can be expected to help reverse the decline, he said, "This is not a part of the solution, but the timing is extremely urgent."</p>

<h3>Small General Assembly Passes Resolution: South Korea Decides to Hold Elections, Korean Committee Prepares to Return to Korea to Work</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations Small General Assembly has passed the US-proposed resolution to hold elections in South Korea by a vote of 31 to 2, with 11 abstentions. Australia and Canada voted against, while Venezuela, Sweden, Norway, and Egypt abstained. Earlier this week, the United States suggested that elections should be held immediately, regardless of Soviet opposition, to establish a Korean National Government and simultaneously establish a legislative body to prepare for the possible participation of North Korean representatives. Australian representative Mr. Halley stated that he believes that the resolution passed by the General Assembly does not authorize the Korean Committee to hold national elections, and the Small General Assembly should not handle this matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Halley further stated that the Australian delegation also foresees another possible danger, namely that South Korea and North Korea may produce opposing authorities, both claiming to represent the Korean people. If a national government is established in South Korea, the United Nations should not ignore the threats that government may face. The Australian delegation advocated holding elections that only serve a consultative role, so that the elected Korean representatives can exchange opinions with the United Nations Committee and the United Nations General Assembly on holding national elections, and then decide on holding elections. Swedish representative Mr. Haglov stated that Sweden's opinion is the same as Norway's, believing that it is necessary to convene a special session of the General Assembly or a consultation of the Five Powers. He believes that the answer to the Korean question lies in compromise and negotiation, and the United Nations adopting this approach may have more opportunities to achieve concrete results than other methods. Egyptian representative Mr. Fawzi expressed doubts about whether the United Nations Korean Committee can hold national elections in South Korea, or whether such elections will truly contribute to the unification of Korea. Therefore, Egypt is not in a position to support the US proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] [Several leaders of the Korean Committee will return to Seoul next week to prepare for the election of two-thirds of the representatives to the Korean National Assembly. The remaining one-third of the representatives will be invited through Soviet cooperation. Indian representative Mr. Menon told United Press that the Korean Committee he leads is extremely pleased with this positive and resolute decision authorizing us to begin our work.</p>
<h3>Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee's Reactions Differ</h3>

Kim Gu stated, "I oppose the separate elections in South Korea and the People's Republic of Korea in North Korea, which will divide the fatherland. I firmly advocate that the North and South must be unified." Kim Kyu-sik also stated, "The resolution of the United Nations Korean Committee cannot be opposed, but I will withdraw from all political activities from now on."</p>

<p>The Method of [That Which Can Be Tolerated, What Cannot Be Tolerated]</p>
<p>When Soviet troops began entering Romania in April 1944, relations between the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries began to occupy a prominent place in our diplomacy.</p>
<p>Many newspapers speculated whether the Soviet Union's aim was liberation or possession. On May 30, 1944, British Ambassador Halifax suddenly asked me what our country's feeling would be if Britain and the Soviet Union devised a method whereby the Soviet Union could have control in Romania and Britain could have control in Greece.</p>
<p>He handed me a written document from his government, asking whether we would object if Britain and the Soviet Union reached an agreement whereby, in general terms, Romanian affairs would be managed by the Soviet government and Greek affairs would be managed by the United Kingdom. This Anglo-Soviet understanding would only apply in wartime and would not affect the rights and responsibilities that any of the three major powers must exercise in a peaceful settlement.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Office said that the United Kingdom government was well aware that dividing the Balkan countries into spheres of influence should be avoided as much as possible, and even the impression of doing so should be prevented.</p>
<p>After telling Halifax that I would give this matter serious consideration, I said frankly:</p>
<p>At first glance, it is highly questionable to abandon the policies, principles, and methods of our broad basic declaration, given that one government after another has accused each other of interfering in the economic, political, military, and other internal affairs of the Balkan countries and other European countries, and such accusations are certain to continue to occur in the future. If the original proposition is deviated from in one or two important respects, as you suggest, then neither of the two countries involved in this action will have a precedent or any fixed rule to follow, or to insist that other governments must follow.</p>
<p>In fact, I was frankly opposed to dividing any part of Europe into spheres of influence. I had strongly opposed it at the Moscow Conference, and in my view, the establishment of any sphere of influence would inevitably sow the seeds of future conflict. I felt that spheres of influence would inevitably undermine the supreme authority of international security institutions, which I expected to emerge.</p>
<p>I did not, and do not now, believe in the idea of maintaining peace through a balance of power or spheres of influence.</p>
<p>The next day, May 31, Prime Minister Churchill telegraphed the President directly, strongly advocating that we approve the proposed agreement. Halifax had undoubtedly telegraphed him my opinion. He stated that Britain did not want to divide the Balkan countries into spheres of influence, that this method was only applicable in wartime, and that the US and British governments would continue their current cooperation without change in formulating and implementing Allied policies towards Greece and Romania.</p>
<p>His telegram provided two additional pieces of information: first, that the agreement had been proposed to Soviet Ambassador Gusev in London by the British government; and second, that the Soviet side had informed the British side on May 18 that they agreed with the proposal, but before they could give a final guarantee, they wanted to know whether they had consulted with the US government and whether we agreed with the method.</p>
<p>Roosevelt sent me the telegram for consideration and asked me to draft a reply.</p>
<p>My colleagues in the State Department agreed with my original attitude towards Halifax, that we could not support such agreements and that we should, in fact, restrain them as much as possible.</p>
<p>While this reply was being prepared in the State Department, another telegram arrived from the Prime Minister on June 8. He reiterated that there was no question of spheres of influence involved. He seemed to be saying again that although we must act together, someone must take action. In his view, the Soviets should deal with the Romanians and Bulgarians, and the British should deal with the Greeks, because Greece was within the British theater of operations and was an old ally of Britain, for whom Britain had sacrificed 40,000 men in 1941. He also said this was accurate for Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill expressed his opinion that he had been trying to keep him informed of all the circumstances, but that Britain was dealing with Greek affairs and had to act with extreme caution so that the Soviets could agree. He pointed out that the situation in the Balkans was evolving very quickly.</p>
<p>He said that Britain always tried to follow America's lead in South America, as long as it did not involve its own food issues. As for matters of its own vital interest, then for the sake of "filial" relations, it would of course take a strong stand.</p>
<p>This telegram was important because it raised two countries that the British side had not mentioned until now—Bulgaria, to be handled by the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, to be handled by the United Kingdom. So opposing this approach now seemed more urgent than ever, because doing so would place one group of countries under the Soviet Union and another group under the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>On June 10, the President sent our reply to the Prime Minister. In his reply, the President acknowledged that the government responsible for military operations in any country—Britain being militarily responsible for Greece and the Soviet Union for Romania—sometimes had to make decisions for the needs of military development. But we believed that the agreement proposed by the British would inevitably strengthen the natural tendency for such decisions to extend into the political and economic spheres. The President expressed the opinion that this tendency would inevitably cause constant disagreements between Britain and the Soviet Union and divide the Balkan countries into spheres of influence, even though Churchill said the agreement was limited to military aspects. The President concluded by saying that we hoped to establish a consultative body for the Balkans to eliminate misunderstandings and prevent the continued development of independent spheres of influence.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister sent a strong reply the next day—June 11—stating that the President's telegram made him very worried. He said that if everyone had to consult with everyone else before taking action, action would be paralyzed. Developments in the Balkans often evolved faster than changes in the overall situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill gave two examples of how direct action he had taken at the time had resolved the situation—the mutiny of the Greek army in Istria and the potential difficulties in Egypt. If Britain had to consult with other countries, and three or four countries had to telegraph each other, the result could be chaos and unmanageability.</p>
<p>He expressed the opinion that the President's telegram to him during the Greek crisis had had a startling effect. He and the President were in complete agreement, and the result was completely satisfactory. He asked why all this effective guidance should be dispersed to incompetent officials on a committee, who were currently scattered around the world. He also asked why he and the President could not keep this guidance in their own hands, since they were much closer to everything.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister finally suggested trying his proposed method for three months, after which it would be reviewed by the three powers.</p>
<p>When this telegram arrived, I was in Pennsylvania taking a few days off at Hanshee. The President did not consult with me or the State Department and replied the next day, accepting the Prime Minister's proposal to try it for three months, but stating that everything must be done carefully so as to make it clear that it was not establishing a postwar sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The President did not inform the State Department of this action.</p>
<p>I returned to Washington at that time. On the day I returned—June 12—not knowing about the President's telegram to the Prime Minister, we sent a memorandum that the President had previously approved to the British Embassy, in which we listed the arguments against the proposed Anglo-Soviet agreement.</p>
<p>On June 17, still unaware of the President's telegram to the Prime Minister on June 12, I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, pointing out that Churchill was openly applying his proposal to the entire Balkan region, since he had raised Bulgaria and Yugoslavia in addition to Romania and Greece, and pointing out that he had cited our position in South America as a metaphor.</p>
<p>I said, "Although Mr. Churchill has reiterated the British position, it does not overcome our opposition or seem to change our view of this dangerous proposal."</p>
<p>I also called his attention to what I considered to be "the most perplexing aspect of the matter"—that the British had not discussed a proposal of this nature with us until after it had been made to the Soviets and the latter had inquired whether we had been consulted beforehand.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Office had stated that the entire proposal had arisen from a chance remark by Eden to Ambassador Gusev, but Mr. Churchill had clearly stated in his frank telegram of May 31 that Britain had indicated to the Soviet Ambassador that Britain and the Soviet Union should reach their own agreement on Romania and Greece. I said, "The Prime Minister's telegram shows that our government will face an already established sphere of influence agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, should the Soviet side immediately agree without raising the question of our position."</p>
<p>On June 28, a telegram from our ambassador to Greece, Lincoln MacVeagh (the embassy was then located in Cairo), drew our attention, informing us that his British counterpart had informed him that the US government had agreed to the proposal, with the proviso that it be reviewed again after three months. This was our first indication of the President's decision on June 12.</p>
<p>I wrote a letter to the President, which I sent to him the next day, enclosing the contents of Ambassador MacVeagh's telegram and asking him whether our position had changed.</p>
<p>The President replied on June 30, enclosing only a few sections or summaries of the telegrams he had exchanged with Mr. Churchill.</p>
<p>These included the telegram drafted by the State Department and sent by me to the President on June 17 for dispatch to Mr. Churchill. This telegram was sent to the Prime Minister by the President on June 22, in which he said that he was somewhat concerned about the situation in the Balkans, as was the State Department. He said that the fact that Britain had only raised this issue with us after it had proposed it to the Soviets and the latter had inquired whether we agreed was indeed quite perplexing to us. He said that in the future he hoped to prevent such important matters from developing along this route.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied the next day—June 23—saying that he did not admit that he had done anything wrong. He pointed out that the people of the three countries were scattered in different parts of the world, and that if one country had to notify the third party of any proposal to another country, it would be impossible to work together effectively. He gave an example of the President sending a telegram to U.J. about his conversation with Prime Minister Mikolajczyk of Poland without informing Churchill beforehand. (The President and Prime Minister sometimes used the abbreviation U.J. for Uncle Joe to refer to Stalin.)</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt replied on June 26, saying that in his view, they had all inadvertently taken unilateral action, and that they now all agreed that this was due to the urgent needs of the time. He insisted that they should always maintain consistency on all issues relating to the Allied war effort. He then sent Mr. Churchill a copy of the telegram he had sent to Stalin about his conversation with Mikolajczyk.</p>
<p>Subsequent events fully confirmed our fears about this Anglo-Soviet approach, which had taken effect under the President's approval. When Prime Minister Churchill and Eden went to Moscow in October 1944 to meet with Stalin and Molotov, they took this approach a step further, even stipulating the percentages of influence that Britain and the Soviet Union would have in the Balkan countries. Telegrams from our embassies in Moscow and Ankara mentioned that the Soviet Union had a 75-to-25 or 80-to-20 advantage in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, while Britain and the Soviet Union would divide Yugoslavia equally at 50-to-50. Later, the Soviets came to believe that under the June 1944 agreement, the US and Britain had treated part of the Balkans, including Romania and Bulgaria, as their sphere of influence. This assumption had a negative impact during the Yalta Conference in February 1945.</p>

<p>(C) Regarding how to stabilize the prices of public utilities: It is recommended that the central government restore the subsidy system for public utilities and transportation, and at least for the necessary materials and fuels (such as coal, diesel, and gasoline) required by these utilities, the government should set a relatively stable allocation or exchange rate within three months in order to reduce the factors causing price increases in public utilities and transportation.</p>

<h3>Sky Shop Lands at Longhua. The Fuselage is Painted with National Flags of Various Countries Passed Through. Hosting a Banquet for All Sectors Today</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] The "Sky Shop" jointly organized by the American Atlas Materials Company and Mobil Oil Company flew from Hong Kong to Longhua Airport in the city at 12:30 pm yesterday. Zhang Peter, head of the Municipal Government's Liaison Section, and Mobil Oil Company staff members welcomed them at the airport. The "Sky Shop" is a DC-4 type four-engine giant aircraft. The fuselage is silver and red, and the national flags of various countries around the world are painted in two rows near the cabin door, all of which have been flown by the aircraft. They include the United States, Canada, Cuba, Panama, Canal Zone, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Trinidad, Dominica, Puerto Rico, Liberia, Congo, Union of South Africa, Egypt, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, India, Sikkim, Siam, Annam, Hong Kong, and other places. The national flags of various countries are colorful and beautiful. However, the display inside the fuselage is not as novel and rich as imagined. The seats are exactly the same as those of ordinary DC-4 type aircraft. Only photos of Mobil gas stations are pasted on both walls, and various samples of tires, batteries, chargers, spark plugs, and paints, as well as automobile lights and flashlights, are displayed at the front of the fuselage near the nose, totaling about dozens of items. Among them, the more special one is a fast and safe battery charger that can charge in a car within an hour.

The eight people who arrived in Shanghai on the plane yesterday were Atlas Company President Bei Zong and others, four representatives from Mobil Park Company including Davis, and six people including the driver and telegraph operator. They all stayed at the Mao Hotel and will host a grand banquet for leaders from all walks of life in the city tonight. Tomorrow, they will host a tour at Longhua Airport.

The matter is currently under detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Route Ice Navigation Fee Canceled</h3>

<h3>Military Service Conference to Be Held Tomorrow: Four Important Proposals from the Military Service Association; Selection by Lottery as the Principle; Collection and Transportation Should Be Localized</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Military Service Conference for the 37th year of the Republic will be held tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the Municipal Council Hall.

Xu Siping, Director of the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, will not be able to come to Shanghai due to official duties and has sent Wei Rulin, Deputy Director of the Bureau, to Shanghai tonight to provide guidance. Based on the practical experience of assisting the competent authorities in handling military service administration last year, the Military Service Association will submit the following important proposals to the conference: (1) This year's conscription should be based on the principle of lottery selection. (2) Conscripted recruits should be collected and transported locally, equipped with weapons, and the local self-defense forces should be strengthened. (3) The family support amount should be increased compared to the previous year and paid in three installments before and after enlistment. (4) The fundraising for family support fees should be done through a unified planning and expenditure approach, eliminating the separate fundraising methods of various districts to avoid various malpractices. The Civil Affairs Bureau, in light of last year's situation and adhering to the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength," will also submit important proposals for discussion. Yao Wenying, Section Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Bureau, will also provide explanations on improving conscription techniques. For example, he stated that the quota for conscription in each district should be allocated according to the population or according to the number of people approved for exemption or deferment after application, and that there will inevitably be many disputes after the decision to conscript by lottery, so it is necessary to discuss this in advance. He believes that the draft lottery proposal may be passed at tomorrow's military service conference.</p>

<h3>Cigarette Paper Shop Owner Injured in Hit-and-Run Case: Driver of the Causing Vehicle Cannot Be Summoned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gong Rongqing, the owner of the Huaxing Cigarette Paper Shop, and Shao Jinxian, a rickshaw puller, have filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office against the driver of Special Truck No. 65259 of the Transportation and Transport Company for negligent injury. According to the complaint, on December 29th of last year, Wang was riding in a rickshaw when Special Truck No. 65259 rear-ended them at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road, crushing the rickshaw and knocking the passenger to the ground, causing serious injuries. Police Officer Zhu Rongxi, No. 629, witnessed the incident.

<h3>Arrest of Drug Dealers Causes Disturbance: Kunshan Police Station Destroyed</h3>
<p>Yu Renliang Transferred to Shanghai District Court for Trial</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, Yu Renliang was found loitering near the Jianghu Airport, holding ten strips of white cloth, branches, tree bark, stones, and other items. The airport guards were very suspicious and interrogated him. Yu claimed to be from Kunshan and spoke evasively. The guards searched his body and found eight trouser belts, one of which contained a packet of heroin.

Yesterday, the case was transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court, handled by Judge Shao Renjie, and the court will open soon.</p>

<h3>Please Postpone Enforcement of the Dance Ban Before the Reemployment Issue is Resolved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Results of the Social Affairs Committee Review Meeting: (1) Regarding the case of "Please severely punish the instigators and followers who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, release the innocent, and withdraw the order to ban dancing," the review opinion: (A) Request the government to severely punish the rioters who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau in accordance with the law, and promptly release those whose crimes are insufficient. (B) Considering that stability is paramount during this period of suppressing the rebellion, Shanghai dance halls have a long history, and a large number of people are employed in the industry. No less than tens of thousands of people directly depend on it for their livelihoods. The situation is indeed different from that of other cities. Therefore, before the issue of reemployment for corrupt employees and dancers can be properly resolved, the Municipal Government should be requested to forward the previous resolution of the General Assembly to the Central Government for temporary suspension of enforcement. (2) Request the Municipal Government to consider increasing the non-staple food for the refugees in various institutions under the Municipal Relief Institute. (3) The proposal to "universally establish citizen consumer cooperatives in districts and guarantees to promote daily necessities" was approved in principle and sent to the Municipal Government to properly plan and effectively implement it, and to provide as much loan assistance as possible to well-organized cooperatives. (4) Regarding the issue of relief for unemployed youth, although the Ministry of Social Affairs has already established an unemployment registration agency in Shanghai, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has also implemented work-for-relief among refugees, the number of unemployed youth is too large, and the unemployment problem is becoming increasingly serious. The effectiveness of the above work is still insufficient. The Municipal Government should be requested to promptly order the Social Affairs Bureau to formulate effective methods and implement them effectively. In addition, the meeting also reviewed multiple cases concerning public pawnshops, universal allocation of food, and daily necessities.</p>
<h3>Demolition of Houses on Tianmu Road: Committee Established to Properly Plan for the Aftermath</h3>
<p>Results of the Public Works Committee Review Meeting: (1) Regarding the application for the allocation of land for the Pudong Zhongfang Spinning Factory's roadway, please expedite the Municipal Government's telegram to the Executive Yuan. (2) Passed the proposal to change the names of Pudong's Lao Sanjing to Victory Town and Xin Sanjing to Zhongshan Town. (3) Request the Municipal Government to instruct all competent authorities to closely monitor and prevent armed personnel from arbitrarily demanding extortion under the pretext of inspecting building permits in the suburbs. (4) Regarding the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road, the review decided: This case involves residents complaining about their hardship, and we express our deep sympathy. However, after repeated resolutions by the Provisional Council and multiple general assemblies of this council, and having been approved by the Executive Yuan, in order to take into account the current facts, it is proposed that the Municipal Government, together with this council and representatives of residents, as well as representatives of the district government and the district people's representative assembly, jointly form a committee to properly plan for the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminal Who Escaped Prison Not Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Nakano Hisayoshi, the Japanese war criminal who escaped from prison, was originally scheduled to be retried by the military court yesterday morning after his capture. However, because the prisoner was still being held at the police station yesterday and had not yet been transferred, the court did not open.

<h3>Military Personnel Drug Trafficking Organization Cracked at the Far East Hotel; Smuggled from Jinzhou, Northeast, to Shanghai for Sale Three Times; Twelve Criminals Arrested, More Than Two Ounces of Opium Seized</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Xiaohua, the first squad leader of the Garrison Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, discovered two officers with the rank of major acting suspiciously in front of the Far East Hotel on Tibet Road at around 9:00 PM the night before last while leading his squad on patrol. Upon questioning, one claimed to be Song Gangmu, the major deputy battalion commander of the 12th Army Engineering Battalion, and his leave pass was dated from January 26th to March 26th of the 37th year of the Republic. The other claimed to be Hou Zixin, the major battalion commander of the 12th Army Communications Battalion. When Hou presented his leave pass, he accidentally dropped another one. After inspection by Squad Leader Xu, it was discovered that it belonged to the major company commander of the Provisional 20th Division of the 93rd Army, and the date filled in was inconsistent with that of the 12th Army Communications Battalion, while the name was the same, which aroused suspicion. After taking the two to the squad for interrogation, eight blank leave passes from the 293rd Army and a medical certificate for a hospital visit were found on Hou's person. It was then learned that they had actually come to Shanghai in December of last year and stayed in room 303 of the Far East Hotel. Upon further questioning, their statements became evasive. After Squad Leader Xu requested instructions from Road Squad Leader, he sent officers to search room 303 of the Far East Hotel. More than ten ounces of opium and a book of blank leave passes from the 93rd Army Headquarters, totaling sixty-five, and an official seal with the inscription "Commander of the 12th Army" were found inside a container of Vaseline. At that time, two other soldiers came forward and were also detained. The two, named Dai Yuhong (also known as Zhou Yongbin) and Li Lan, claimed to be orderlies from the 12th Army Communications Battalion. Based on their testimony, more than dozens of ounces of opium were found under a large tree in room 303. At around midnight, Wang Tianwu, Li Chunfang, Bao Ze, and three others were arrested. At this point, Song and Hou finally admitted to conspiring to smuggle opium from Jinzhou, Northeast, to Shanghai for sale. They claimed that they had done this three times before, and upon arriving in Shanghai, they had sold it to Liu Xihan at No. 13, Caiyang Lane, Xiaojiuhua Street, Nanshi. According to their testimony, the squad immediately sent officers to search the address. Liu had already fled, and only his concubine, Liu Hansuying, was found. However, three pieces of opium, weighing a total of 26 ounces, were also found there. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, the team members who remained at the Far East Hotel detained another person named Shu Kanghou, who came to the place to negotiate the purchase of opium. He claimed to be a retired battalion commander and also a fellow accomplice. From his testimony, it was revealed that a drug addict and dealer named Shi Han resided at No. 17, Jindeli, Xinghua Street, Nanshi. Officers were immediately dispatched to arrest Shi and his wife. Finally, another accomplice, Zhang Tongcheng, was arrested in the Xinping Apartments on Taicang Road. In total, twelve suspects, men and women, were arrested in this case and are currently being detained in the first brigade for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>National Association of the YWCA: Fundraising to Host People from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of China plans to raise 2.5 billion yuan for its work this year. A fundraising meeting was held at the Bank of China auditorium at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by more than two hundred people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. Ms. Cai Kui, the general secretary of the association, personally hosted the event.

<h3>National Credit Cooperative: Continued Educational Loans</h3>
<p>The National Credit Cooperative, in order to promote the welfare of its members and alleviate the financial difficulties of their children's education, offered educational loans for children last autumn at low interest rates and in installments of three months, which proved to be quite effective. The cooperative will continue to offer these loans this semester. Members who have such needs can apply for registration with the cooperative before March 5th.</p>
<h3>Thrifty Vegetable Prices to Increase by Onefold: The Social Affairs Bureau is Reviewing the Report</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Wine and Vegetable Industry Association previously submitted a report stating that the thrifty vegetable prices for banquets stipulated by the authorities were no longer viable due to fluctuations in commodity prices and rising raw material costs. They requested permission to adjust prices themselves at any time and report them to the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping, as applying for price adjustments through official channels was cumbersome and time-consuming. Director Wu believes that the industry can determine the average price of several major ingredients and use the extent of their price fluctuations as the standard for setting banquet prices. The Wine and Vegetable Industry Association has now stipulated that the average price of five ingredients - chicken, meat, fish, duck, and shrimp - will be used as the standard for Chinese-style banquets, the average price of three ingredients - chicken, fish, and pork - will be used as the standard for Western-style banquets, and the average price of rice will be used as the standard for Chinese and Western economy meals. Based on the above standards, the association submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting an increase of 100% over the previously stipulated prices, with the highest price for a Chinese-style banquet being 3.6 million yuan per table, the highest price for a Western-style meal being 360,000 yuan per person, and the highest price for both Chinese and Western economy meals being 70,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently reviewing the request.</p>

<h3>The Special Donation Fundraising Committee Formally Established Yesterday; Difficulties in Implementation Due to Lack of Standards for the Wealthy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Relief Special Donation Fundraising Committee held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the municipal government conference room. Present were Director Wu Guozhen, Deputy Directors Pan Gongzhan and Du Yuesheng, and committee members Wu Yun Chu, Xi Wang, Xu Jiqing, Jing Yunzhang, Qin Runqing, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Xianqing, Wu Kaixian, and others, who jointly discussed fundraising methods. According to Mayor Wu, after the meeting, he told reporters: "The implementation of special relief donations is quite difficult. There has never been an accurate survey of the people's property in this city, and it is difficult to set standards for the wealthy. Furthermore, the central government has not provided detailed measures, so I only know to designate targets and ask them to donate money voluntarily. If they do not donate, I will send someone to urge them to pay. If they still ignore me after urging, I don't know what to do."</p>
<h3>Property Investigation Intends to Draft a List</h3>
<p>According to the three resolutions made at the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Relief Committee in Nanjing on the 26th: (1) The total amount of donations in the Shanghai area is 550 billion yuan; (2) The Shanghai area includes Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places; (3) Donation targets: (A) Those with exceptionally high incomes during the War of Resistance and the Suppression of Rebellion; (B) Large merchants and tycoons; (C) Social legal entities with strong financial resources and thriving businesses. Furthermore, according to the central government's regulations, the list of donation targets in the Shanghai area should be submitted by March 15th. The municipal government has now decided to start investigating the property of the wealthy and draft a list, while also telegraphing the central government to clarify the detailed measures as soon as possible, so that they can be followed. As for Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places, the committee has suggested that each place nominate the speaker of the local council to serve on the committee and be responsible for the implementation of special relief donations in that area.</p>
<h3>Fire Breaks Out on the Huangpu River at Midnight; The Victory Steamer Catches Fire and Sinks; Crew Unharmed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Victory steamer of Tongyu Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 1,000 tons, was carrying sleepers from the Ministry of Communications to Nanjing. The ship was berthed at buoy number 15 on the Nanshi Huangpu River and had been loading cargo for several days. The ship burned diesel oil, so it had eighty barrels of diesel oil stored on board. At about 2:00 AM yesterday, there was a sudden accident in the furnace room. Because the crew members were all asleep at night, when they discovered the fire, the diesel oil had already caught fire, and the fire was fierce. They immediately sounded the horn for help. The Jianghai Customs Fire Brigade was notified and sent multiple fireboats to extinguish the fire. However, because the diesel oil and sleepers in the ship were all flammable, the fire was uncontrollable, and the deck was completely on fire. Around 3:00 AM, the ropes tied to the buoy were burned, and it was high tide. The ship drifted south with the tide to Xuejia浜 Huangpu River, where it capsized and sank. Fortunately, the crew had already left the ship and were all unharmed.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Sino-Belgian Railway Company: Prosperous Belgium</h3>
<p>— Third Letter, Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Brussels, 17th (Airmail)] During my stay in Brussels, I met Consul General Wang Kexun, a "China expert," at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This Belgian diplomat, who has lived in China for over thirty years, knows Chinese customs, habits, and social practices. His original name seems to be pronounced "Wen Kouhui." The three characters Wang Kexun were given to him by a Chinese friend. He arrived in China in 1911, the year of the Wuchang Uprising, and served as consul in Tianjin, Hankou, and Harbin. He spent the last ten years as consul general in Shanghai before being recalled to the ministry last year. All the officials, big and small, in the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs still call him "Consul General." He is quite popular among the public.</p>
<p>I asked "Consul General" if he would like to return to China again. He said: It would be best to have the opportunity to return to China to do business. I believe this statement is not only Wang Kexun's personal opinion; it represents the common view of the Belgian business community, large and small. Belgian engineers and Belgian capital once helped us build the Pinghan Railway, the Longhai Railway, the Yaohua Glass Factory in Qinhuangdao, and even participated in the creation of the Hanyeping Company. In the late years of the late Qing Dynasty, through the hands of Zhang Zhidong and Sheng Xuanhuai, who advocated "foreign affairs," we made considerable use of Belgian "foreign capital," and there were no political disputes between China and Belgium caused by Belgian foreign capital.</p>
<p>Industrial Investment</p>
<p>A Chinese person who has resided in Belgium for many years said: In the late 19th century, during the reign of Emperor Leopold II, Belgium may have had some "ambitions" toward China. Emperor Leopold II specially invited Li Hongzhang to Beijing and treated him with great courtesy. At that time, the Belgian government also seemed to have some ideas. China was not divided during the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, followed by the Xinhai Revolution and the First European War. Belgium no longer had any "political ambitions" toward China. That friend's conclusion was quite clever: Today, if we talk about economic cooperation with Belgium, as long as we succeed, we will not be fooled!</p>
<p>How can we succeed? I casually discussed this with Consul General Wang Kexun in my capacity as a journalist. He said: National loans must go through formal diplomatic "contact." In the two years since the war, the Chinese government has only asked the United States for money and has never mentioned it to Belgium. "Of course," he said, "Belgium does not yet have the ability to release foreign exchange, but industrial investment, such as building factories, especially building railways, is something that Belgium has an interest in and the ability to do!"</p>
<p>President Jadot</p>
<p>I thank Acting Chargé d'Affaires Qu Chunbo for introducing me to Mr. Jadot, President of the "Sino-Belgian Railway Company," an honest industrialist of 75 years old. Mr. Jadot's full name is Jules Jadot. His brother, Jean Jadot, was the chief engineer who built the Pinghan Railway. Jules Jadot also lived in China for a long time. After returning to Belgium, he became the president of the Sino-Belgian Railway Company. Last October, the company's name was changed to "Far East Railway Company," but in practice, it still focuses on China. The company's English secretary, Mr. Hautefeuille, put it well: "Our company's target is still only China. Therefore, we fully support investing more in China, because this is our profession and our livelihood!"</p>
<p>Secretary Muller</p>
<p>I visited Mr. Jadot's residence at 32 Rue de la Science in Brussels. This 75-year-old "friend of China" was bedridden. I presented him with a bouquet of flowers on behalf of Shen Bao. The next day, I met Mr. Muller, the company's chief secretary and the person most responsible for all business, at the company's office on Rue de l'Industrie. He told me that the Pinghan Railway was built by their company. Three years before the Xinhai Revolution, in 1908, the Manchu Qing government prepared funds to purchase it and returned it to Chinese state ownership. Today, the Longhai Railway's bond coupons are still held by the company, because the Longhai's bond coupons were not worth much during the Chinese war, so the company completely stored them and did not trade them on the stock market. Mr. Muller did not mention the Longhai Railway's profit and loss situation. He only said that before 1937, the company sent a batch of locomotives and railway equipment to the Pinghan and Longhai railways, and the Chinese side has not yet cleared this payment.</p>
<p>Building Railways</p>
<p>I told him that although there are disturbances in China at present, the southern and southwestern provinces are very peaceful and suitable for investment. Does the "Far East Railway Company" have any plans to invest in building some new railways in China? He was very interested and said that when Mr. Ling Hongxun came to Belgium last year, he once talked about building railways in South China, but later he did not hear any concrete plans from the Chinese side, and there was no formal discussion in Sino-Belgian diplomacy. He also said that according to the company's principles for foreign investment, there must first be a guarantee from the Belgian government and the Belgian National Bank. How can the Belgian government guarantee? It completely depends on the formal diplomatic negotiations between the Chinese and Belgian governments. He said that the Belgian side is very interested in this, but the question is whether the Chinese government will propose it first. In addition, he also said: "The second question is the payment after the railway is built. In the past, Chinese payments were all made through the Bank of England, based on the pound sterling. In the future, we hope to change to US dollars as the basis."</p>
<p>Finding Customers</p>
<p>Mr. Muller also said that the Far East Railway Company has an office in Shanghai, located in Room 307, 150 Jiujiang Road. "The director of the office there, Mr. Reynart, is a capable and astute character." He also told me in passing that last month, Mr. Reynart flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou to see Chairman Song Shiwen. I asked him if it was related to negotiations on railway investment in South China. He laughed: "Of course, China needs railway construction!"</p>
<p>I asked them about the production of steel and railway equipment in Belgium. Mr. Hautefeuille, the English secretary, replied that Belgium's heavy industrial production has not only recovered to pre-war levels, but many sectors have far exceeded pre-war levels. "For example, new rails are currently piled up like mountains. The main thing is to find customers, customers who can pay cash!"</p>
<p>Consul General Wang</p>
<p>This is what Consul General Wang Kedong told me: "France and Belgium cannot be mentioned in the same breath." That day, Consul General Wang Kexun had just returned to Beijing from Paris. He saw tens of thousands of French people protesting outside the parliament, demanding that the parliament reject the government's proposal to "abolish the 5,000-franc banknote." Consul General Wang stretched out his hands and said: "Fortunately, we Belgians are not so corrupt. There are few communists in Belgium, and few strikes, so we are recovering faster!"</p>
<p>Because the time was too short, I did not meet Mr. Etienne, the vice president of the Belgian National Railway Company, a close friend of Acting Chargé d'Affaires Qu Chunbo. Mr. Etienne's secretary took me to visit various departments. It was a large enterprise organization with thousands of employees. I went from upstairs to downstairs, and then from downstairs to upstairs in the elevator. The scene of such a large enterprise proved the strength of the Belgian railway industry. In the residence of a Chinese overseas Chinese, I saw a detailed map of the Belgian national railway network. Almost every city and town has main or branch railway lines. Many overseas Chinese who do business can spend 5,000 francs a month to buy a long-term "pass" and travel all over the country, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Belgium</p>
<p>There are very few overseas Chinese in Belgium, less than one hundred in total. They have an organization called the "Association of Chinese Merchants in Belgium," whose president is Ni Zuoyou, an honest and upright old man. Most of the overseas Chinese are engaged in the leather business, manufacturing leather bags, wallets, and the like. Their economic situation is far inferior to that of the Netherlands. There are no Chinese restaurants in Brussels. It is said that some overseas Chinese leaders from the Netherlands and Paris are raising funds to prepare a large-scale Chinese restaurant in Brussels. They have already invested more than 30,000 US dollars just in housing and property.</p>
<p>Remittance Restrictions</p>
<p>Belgium's remittance of overseas Chinese money back to China is a great diplomatic success in Europe. In 1945, Acting Chargé d'Affaires Qu Chunbo contacted the Belgian financial authorities, and the Belgian National Bank agreed that overseas Chinese could remit 5,000 Belgian francs per person per month, about 115 US dollars. Those with families could remit 10,000 francs. Overseas Chinese remittances must first be certified by the Chinese Merchants Association, and then go to the embassy to obtain a remittance application form, which must state "According to the Belgian authorities' letter of that year and month, how many francs are allowed to be remitted." It is said that the Belgian foreign exchange control authorities are a little regretful about this, because the amount was set too high (France only allows overseas Chinese to remit 5,000 French francs per year, about 17 US dollars), but Qu Chunbo said: "This is a done deal, and no one can renege!" It is said that in 1946 alone, the total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in Belgium back to China exceeded one million Belgian francs.</p>
<p>However, the crisis is that the small handicrafts of the overseas Chinese are now declining day by day. They earn less money, living is expensive, and there is also competition among themselves. Every time I pass through Belgium and see our hard-working overseas Chinese, and then think of their large enterprises and foreign investment, I feel an infinite sense of vigilance!

<h3>Major Massacre in Dongchen Town, Rugao; Jiang Family, Father and Three Sons, Die by Gunfire on the Same Day</h3>
<p>[Rugao, 22nd] An unprecedented massacre occurred in Dongchen Town, the second district of this county, on the night of the 17th of this month. Our reporter has personally investigated it, and the report is as follows: The Jiangwu Township office, located in Chexiang County, is constantly moving near the town. That evening, Li Hechou (Zi Fengming), the head of the township, claimed that he ambushed bandit troops in the township and instructed Jiang Baishou, the township squad leader, to accompany him in leading the team. When they arrived at the Jiang family temple north of the town, Township Head Li shot Squad Leader Jiang in the shoulder with one bullet. Jiang fell to the ground injured and asked loudly. Township Head Li replied that it was a "misfire." Jiang did not suspect anything because Li was not familiar with shooting. He struggled to stand up, but Li fired another shot, piercing Jiang's ribs, and quickly snatched Jiang's pistol. He ordered the team members to shoot. The team members looked at each other in astonishment. Li claimed that Squad Leader Jiang was colluding with bandits and should be executed, and designated a team member to shoot. Ignoring Jiang's cries of injustice, Jiang Baishou knew that it would be difficult to escape, and because he was in unbearable pain, he urged the team member to shoot. He died by gunfire on the spot. Li then led the team back to the residence of Jiang's father, Xi Xian (who served as the chief of the first bao in the township), opened the gate, tied up Jiang Xixian and his second son, Bainian, and executed them in the town, respectively, in Taiping Lane south of the town and on Beijie Street. The Jiang family, father and three sons, died on the same day. Li convened a meeting of bao chiefs that night, claiming that the Jiang family and his sons were colluding with bandits and had been executed, and took out half a piece of sloppily written letter from his bag as evidence. Afterwards, the residents heard about it and were shocked. After a detailed investigation, it was revealed that the township head had served as a puppet township head before the surrender of the enemy and puppets, and was very powerful for a time. He was accustomed to using assassination tactics. This time, he neither reported to his superiors nor sent them to the district for investigation. He falsely claimed a misfire first and assassinated Xixian and his sons later, which was obviously revenge killing. It is said that Township Head Li was afraid that the matter would escalate and went to the district office on the 20th to lobby and arrested a bandit's family member in the township, forcing them to confess that the Jiang family and his sons had delivered letters to the bandits.</p>
<h3>The Jingwu Railway Will Start Construction, with Track-laying Project Conducted in Three Phases</h3>
<p>[Huizhou, 24th] The Jiangnan Railway Company is the only private railway in the country. Before the war, it had achieved brilliant success. At that time, the section from Beijing to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng, with a total length of more than 200 kilometers, was officially opened to traffic. Now, the company has decided to re-lay the tracks on this road and has drawn up a reconstruction plan. The track-laying project will be carried out in three phases: the first phase is from Beijing to Wuhu, with a total length of 91 kilometers; the second phase is from Beijing to Huizhou, with a total length of more than 300 kilometers; the third phase is from Huizhou extending to Guixi, Jiangxi, connecting with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with a total length of more than 600 kilometers. It is currently estimated that laying 100 kilometers of railway will cost approximately 870,000 US dollars. After the company requested funding, it obtained a loan of 800,000 US dollars in foreign exchange from the Joint Treasury, which was approved by the Central Bank at the end of last year. This loan is sufficient to lay the tracks for the Beijing-Wuhu section. The loan contract stipulates that it will be repaid in 24 installments within two years, starting from June this year.</p>
<p>The roadbed from Beijing to Wuhu is intact. The sleepers ordered in the United States have recently arrived one after another. The company has also ordered 19 new passenger cars in the United States for use when the railway opens to traffic. The plan for the first phase of traffic to Wuhu only awaits the return of the rails before construction can begin. It is estimated that the entire section will be completed in March of this year and can be officially opened to traffic in April.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Porcelain Sales Are Outstanding</h3>
<p>[Jingdezhen, 20th] The sales of porcelain in this city have gradually become active after winter. The value of porcelain exported in December last year and January this year is approximately 50 billion or more. Among them, round daily necessities are the most popular, while carved wares are slightly sluggish, especially in Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hankou, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other regions with strong demand.</p>
<h3>Deng Meikui Case: All Parties Are Investigating, and the Truth Will Not Be Difficult to Uncover</h3>
<p>[Changsha, 27th] The Hunan Democratic Economic Association held a meeting on the 26th and passed a resolution to investigate the Deng Meikui murder case in Yiyang. It is said that Deng's murder was not entirely due to rent restrictions and that there were other reasons.

<h3>Yunnan Yi People Resist the Eradication of Opium Seedlings; The Entire Case Has Been Successfully Resolved</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Interior previously received a report from Lei Moynan, the special envoy for opium prohibition in the Yunnan-Guizhou region, on January 11th of this year, stating that a portion of the evil people in Ruili, Yunnan, were resisting the eradication of opium seedlings and plotting to attack the administrative bureau. Also: Kunming Chairman Lu Han telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan, stating: According to the report from Shu Zitian, the director of the Ruili Administrative Bureau: Ruili and Longchuan are adjacent, and Yi people in the Lingwei Jiaoshan area are resisting eradication, surrounding the eradication personnel, and uniting with more than 200 Han Chinese in Longchuan to surround and attack the administrative bureau. The Yunnan Provincial Government immediately telegraphed the garrison command and ordered the garrison troops in Wan町 to rush to assist in suppression, while instructing the district commissioner to enlighten the people and ordering the local chieftains to find ways to quell the situation as a military and political double-pronged approach. After receiving the above report, the Ministry of Interior immediately telegraphed the Yunnan Provincial Government to strictly and quickly investigate and ordered the opium prohibition special envoy Lei Moynan to properly supervise the handling. Later, Kunming Chairman Lu Han telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan on February 2nd, stating: The incident was enlightened by chieftains such as Xian Jintai, and the native people had already dispersed and returned to the mountains. At the same time, the Ministry of Interior also received a telegram from the special envoy Lei, stating that when the special envoy arrived in Wan町, together with Regiment Commander Lu Weiyi of the reorganized 26th Division, who was sent to suppress the situation, they decided to loudly announce an attack while also motivating the chieftains related to the Yi people resisting eradication to understand the pros and cons and order them to disband within a time limit and await government disposal. If they continued to be stubborn, they would be suppressed. Within a few days, they voluntarily disbanded and order was restored. The above is the process that has been gone through and resolved. As for the cause of the conflict, the aftermath, and whether the responsible personnel were negligent in provoking the incident, it is currently being continuously ordered to be investigated and reported for verification. In addition, Mo Ganer, an Yi person from Ebian County in Sichuan Province's fifth district, relying on his military force, also resisted eradication. The district commissioner Liu Renan led a team to supervise the suppression, and it has already been quelled.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Small Civil Servants Exhaust Their Possessions, Wife Disappears, and He Hangs Himself by the Window</h3>

Last autumn, he took too much sick leave and was laid off. Later, he lived by pawning and borrowing money. After the Spring Festival, even the quilt he covered was gone.

<h3>Three-Wheeled Motorcycles Operate on the Jialou Road, Rickshaw Pullers' Business Becomes a Problem, Both Sides Perform a Full-Scale Fight</h3>
<p>[Jiading, 24th] The dispute between rickshaw pullers and three-wheeled motorcycles over the operation on the Jia (ding) Lou (tang) Road is being mediated by the authorities. Unexpectedly, at about 10:30 AM on the 24th, rickshaw pullers, citing livelihood issues, spontaneously gathered dozens of rickshaw pullers to negotiate with the three-wheeled motorcycle drivers outside the north gate, without results. Rickshaw puller Liu Jixian took the lead in smashing the motorcycle windows. Wang, an official from the Loutang Town Office who was a passenger, saw the seriousness of the situation and fired two shots into the sky with his self-defense pistol, causing a misunderstanding among the rickshaw pullers, who rushed forward, ready to respond with force. The Jiading Station north gate parking lot for motorcycles was located opposite the Qia Shun Tai store. The workers of the store witnessed this and were filled with injustice. They each held sticks and assisted the motorcycle drivers in confronting the rickshaw pullers head-on, making the situation even more serious. The county police bureau was notified and Zheng, the section chief, personally led police officers to suppress the situation, and the turmoil was quelled. The perpetrators were taken to the bureau for questioning. Two rickshaw pullers were injured, and some parts of the three-wheeled motorcycles were damaged. After preliminary interrogation by Section Chief Zheng, rickshaw puller Liu Jixian and the two employees of Qia Shun Tai were detained, and the others were released on bail. After this incident, all the rickshaw pullers in the county went on strike one after another, and the authorities are currently mediating the situation.</p>

The military and police did not intervene, and fortunately, no conflict occurred. The students petitioned the Military Affairs Office, demanding four conditions: (1) Replace Cao Shuxi, commander of the 22nd Conscript Battalion; (2) Execute the assailant; (3) Publish an apology in the newspaper; (4) Guarantee the safety of Lanzhou University students.

<h3>Journey to Western Henan (1)</h3>
<p>[Our Shanzhou Dispatch, 14th (Airmail)] Western Henan, a region historically known for its barren land, impoverished people, backward culture, inconvenient transportation, and strategically important terrain, has never been a focus of attention. However, since August 22nd of last year, when bandit chieftain Chen Geng personally led his 100,000 troops across the Yellow River from Shanzhou and occupied Western Henan in one fell swoop, the overall situation in the Central Plains was shaken. This caused people to recognize the strategic geographical value of this area, leading to a common realization: "Without Western Henan, there is no Central Plains; to defend the Central Plains, Western Henan must be secured first." In reality, however, Western Henan was sinking and deteriorating day by day, and the overall situation in the Central Plains was worsening accordingly. Anxiety clouded the brows of the people in the Central Plains, and terror filled every corner. Nevertheless, the resilient compatriots of Western Henan, awakened by the bloody lessons of the communists, rose up spontaneously, gradually clearing out the stubborn bandits, recovering their homeland, and rescuing their fathers and brothers. This slowly restored Western Henan to its original state and lessened the heavy threat to the Central Plains, marking a legendary chapter in the task of suppressing rebellion and defending oneself. The reporter had long been intrigued by the stories and wanted to visit this area to witness the devastation after the calamity and interview some of the folk heroes who rose up to suppress the bandits and save themselves. Fortunately, at the end of last month, I was specially invited by various circles in Western Henan, so I gladly accepted.</p>
<p>Entering Hangu Pass on Horseback</p>
<p>Arriving at Yuyang marked my entry into the gateway of Western Henan. My destination was to proceed from Luoyang, along Xin'an, Mianchi, Shanxian, Lingbao, to Minxiang. However, after arriving in Luoyang, I learned that the Luotong Highway had only been open to military vehicles for a few days because bandits frequently roamed north and south of Mianchi, disrupting transportation again. I considered returning to Zhengzhou to take a plane to Xi'an and then transfer east to Western Henan, but military officials said that the Luotong Highway would resume operation within days, so I waited in Luoyang for seven days. On the morning of February 8th (Lunar December 29th), I was finally loaded onto a military gas truck like smuggled goods, and set off westward.</p>
<p>The truck sped along, and in a little over an hour, we arrived in Xin'an County. Outside the east gate of the city, the stele of the "Ancient Hangu Pass," which had withstood the turmoil and still stood tall, appeared even more ancient and desolate than Germany and Japan. The railway tracks, like dismembered corpses, were scattered and fragmented along the railway. The roadbed was also dug up in a chaotic manner. When would it be resurrected? When my eyes met its corpse, I felt infinite lament and sorrow for this major artery connecting to the northwest.</p>
<p>This mountain city of Xin'an had left many footprints of mine. The city walls and houses here remained deeply imprinted in my mind. But this time, when the car carried me into Xin'an County, I no longer believed that this was the mountain city I knew. After entering the east gate, all I saw were ruins and debris. Slogans from the communists and the Nationalists stood in opposition on these broken walls. The surviving, incomplete city houses were without doors or windows, some with bricks and mud replacing them. Manure and garbage were scattered all over the streets, stray dogs roamed around, and there were few pedestrians. I felt as if I had entered a deserted graveyard, and I couldn't help but shiver, feeling a bit creeped out. The car stopped in front of the dilapidated county government office. Just as I was preparing to get out, several familiar faces appeared below the car. They grasped my hand, and I then recognized them as Guo Pinsan, the county magistrate of Xin'an, and Li Fengchun, the police chief of the county. Their arduous struggle against the communists had transformed them. Their tattered clothes and sallow faces told of their living conditions over the past half year. They had received news in advance that I was passing through there, so they were waiting specifically for me and insisted on me staying for a day. Although I did not accept their invitation because I did not want to delay the car, I stayed for two hours while the driver was eating.</p>
<p>County Government Like a Ruined Temple</p>
<p>The county government was now completely like a ruined temple. One could see straight through from the main street to the last building without any obstruction. The prosperous scene on either side of the county government gate in the past was now nowhere to be found. The Xianhualou Restaurant next door to the east of the county government had become a public toilet. The front of the county government was desolate. Standing there, I felt infinite sorrow and vicissitudes of life. There was no place to buy food here. Thanking their kindness, they bought me two cold buns. They told me that since the communists crossed the Yellow River and invaded from Kuangkou on the eighth day of last year, the county seat had fallen four times and been repeatedly contested, turning the city into a ghost town. Although it had been recovered for over a month now, the residents had either been coerced by the bandits, massacred, or fled to other places. The population in the city was now less than three-tenths of what it used to be. Although there were no precise statistics on the total public and private losses in the county, after this unprecedented catastrophe, it would be difficult for the local vitality to recover within fifty years. The area within seventy li north of the city had been deserted. The communists not only looted all the population and resources in that area but also filled in all the wells. Even if the remaining bandits within the territory could be cleared in the short term, the reconstruction work could not be completed immediately by the county alone. The local armed forces had been almost completely lost. Later, they rose up to suppress the bandits with eighteen guns and had now expanded to two thousand guns. They seemed to have strong confidence in suppressing the bandits, but they had a more pressing hope, which was to eagerly await the government to provide relief.</p>
<p>Xin'an to Mianchi was ninety li, which could originally be reached in two hours. However, the car broke down just north of Qianqiu, more than thirty li east of Mianchi. That place was right on the north-south corridor of the communists. The car stopped in the terrifying wilderness, and the cold wind assailed the frightened hearts of dozens of passengers. Occasionally, a cavalry patrol team of the National Army sped past, but the sound of warhorses only caused more terror, and could not give people any psychological security. In addition, the wilderness was full of weeds and rabbits. Looking around, I felt more and more frightened. Fortunately, after an hour of emergency repairs, the car finally started again. When the setting sun illuminated the flag on the same day, I and the other dozens of strangers arrived at the battered Mianchi together. The city gate was full of soldiers, and there were construction projects everywhere. The neat memorial archways and steles in the east gate were being dismantled by the army to make bunkers. The businessmen were deserted and closed their doors. The atmosphere of war still shrouded this small and poor county seat.</p>
<p>Entertaining the Unexpected Guest</p>
<p>Mianchi was the poorest county. After being occupied by bandits last year, it had turned into a hell on earth in a few months. Although the county seat had been recovered, there were still communists harassing the countryside. The people were impoverished, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Although a large army was currently stationed in the city, it could not immediately make this poor city, which was congenitally deficient and now on its last breath, prosper again. There were only a few small restaurants in the city, no businesses or hotels. In this situation, I had no choice but to stay at the county government. The county government was as dilapidated and desolate as the Xin'an County government. The houses in the backyard had been completely destroyed by the communists. The county magistrate and all the staff were squeezed into a small courtyard in the northwest corner of the front yard of the county government. A student named Wang was working as a secretary here. He was overjoyed to see me, and I almost didn't recognize him. County Magistrate Dong took me into the house, holding my hand tightly, but couldn't say a word. He was a silent, hardworking young man, a graduate of the County Normal School. He had previously worked as a district chief in Wo and had no status in the local area. However, after this occupation, he resolutely and bravely mobilized the people to rise up and suppress the bandits, gradually recovering the county. The Eleventh District Commissioner Tu considered him to have contributed to suppressing the bandits, so after the original county magistrate Ji was killed in action, he was appointed as acting county magistrate. He had now expanded from dozens of guns to more than a thousand guns. He was extremely excited by the unexpected arrival of this unexpected guest. He immediately ordered food to be prepared to welcome the guest and gave up his own bed for me to sleep in. We talked about the local occupation, the communists' shootings and looting, and then about self-defense against bandits and the reconstruction situation. He said that after Mianchi was occupied, the local armed forces were completely lost, and no fewer than five hundred people were killed, with public and private losses exceeding two trillion. Currently, more than seven thousand communists were still gathered in the northeast township. The local militia were cooperating with the National Army to suppress them. The local people were impoverished and eagerly awaiting relief. Otherwise, during the spring famine, I don't know how many people would starve to death. We talked around the stove until it was already eight o'clock. I was hungry and tired, but the food hadn't arrived, and I didn't want to say anything. County Magistrate Dong seemed to be urging for the food as well. It wasn't until half-past eight that the food was finally brought in. It was four dishes and a soup. I started eating without delay, but before I could finish a bowl of rice, I suddenly heard a group of people rushing in from outside, shouting and cursing County Magistrate Dong's name, as if they were about to rush into the house and stab County Magistrate Dong "with a white knife in and a red knife out." I was shocked. County Magistrate Dong was also stunned. No one knew who they were or what it was about. A Deputy Commander Liang quickly took two brothers out to see what was going on. Inside the house, we only heard the people in the yard arguing and cursing: "County Magistrate Dong, if you have the guts, come out. See if I dare to do what you don't dare. Damn it, you did this to embarrass us. Go ask our company commanders if we are easy to mess with. Even if you are entertaining the heavenly king, you have to ask who is sitting here ten li away. If you don't explain the reason today, I will fight to the death!" The person blocking them quickly apologized: "The county magistrate is not at home. The people below are ignorant. Please forgive us!" The other party cursed again: "If your county magistrate isn't here, quickly hand over the person who just went to the restaurant, or we will never give up." Hearing this situation, I was truly restless, but there was no way to go out and defuse the situation. County Magistrate Dong, who was being humiliated for my sake, was trembling and trembling. The atmosphere in the yard was filled with tension, and the voices were boiling. Seeing that this farce, which was caused by me, was about to break out, I thought that it was not surprising that I, a reporter, would be beaten, or even taken away to suffer even more unimaginable torture, but what kind of thing was it for a county magistrate appointed by the government to be beaten and humiliated?</p>

<h3>A Plea for Education</h3>
<p>— Mo Zhongyi</p>
<p>Recently, many people have been scolding education, complaining about education, hating education, and mocking education, saying that education is bankrupt, that education has taken the wrong path, that education harms people, and that education misleads the country. All the bad phenomena in the country and society are attributed to education itself, as if education should bear the entire responsibility for the country and society. Those who scold education do so based on two mentalities. One is that they have too much expectation for education, thinking that education is omnipotent and that if education is well-run, everything will be solved. The other is that they disregard education, look down on education, and think that education is only a tool of politics, at the mercy of politicians and subject to exploitation. Both of these mentalities are extreme. Those who work in education are under attack from both sides, so they are attacked, scolded, ridiculed, and mocked! We, who work in the education field, are not well-fed or well-clothed, and we worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt all day long. We teach other people's children, but our own children have nowhere to study. This is already disheartening, and what's more, we can't even get the understanding of people in society, and we are subjected to insults. How can we not cry out in grievance!</p>
<p>Such Insults to Those Who Eat Chalk Dust</p>
<p>There are too many people who scold education. We often see those irresponsible words in newspapers and magazines. We ask ourselves, education is indeed not well-run. However, what things in China are well-run? Looking at the statistics, objectively analyzing, the education sector in China is not worse than any other sector? There are no achievements? We ask ourselves, what are the achievements in politics, economy, or society in China? We who work in the education sector dare not exaggerate, and we cannot exaggerate what great contributions we have made to education; we also do not forgive ourselves, do not rest on our laurels, we should admit that we have not fulfilled the greatest responsibility for education. We must blame ourselves, we must strive for progress. However, looking around our China, which sector has shouldered the great task it should shoulder? In which corner is there something that is in line with our ideals, beyond reproach? Why do people scold education, scold education more, and not scold others? Such insults to those who eat chalk dust, sell their words, are pale and thin, and have no weapons, we may not be discouraged, but we must cry out in grievance!</p>
<p>Recently, the Ta Kung Pao published two articles on February 20, 21, and 23 of this year, one was written by Mr. Zhang Tianlu, "I Accuse Educators Across the Country," published for two consecutive days, a long article; the other was written by Mr. Gu Zhengqian, "Such Education Should Be Accused," is a supplement to Mr. Zhang Tianlu's "Accusation" to make up for shortcomings. After reading them, we feel that education has been scolded twice again, from the intuition seems that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Gu are right to scold, but after thinking about it in the clear night, we can't help but cry out for education!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, based on his personal experience, pointed out the harm of the education he received from elementary school to university graduation, and therefore accused educators across the country of four points: First, "The entrance exams at all levels cannot really shoulder the mission of selecting qualified young people, on the contrary, it has become a bad system that destroys the body and mind of young people and oppresses the education of schools at a lower level." Second, "Education is not a decoration and patent of the rich, everyone has equal access to education, this is the minimum condition for a democratic country, as for the treatment of normal school students, it cannot be regarded as the same role as the public funding of ordinary students." Third, "Traditional education hinders the development of social life, requiring the improvement of traditional education to suit the needs of public life, further for the sake of improving society." Fourth, "Traditional education focuses solely on the training of books and words, stifling the individuality of young people and cultivating a group of bookworms with academic qualifications." Finally, it concludes: "In recent years, life has been difficult, I still have public funding to eat in university, maybe the family is starving and I don't know. More than ten years of national education, more than ten years of family expectations, more than ten years of suffering myself, when I am about to graduate from university, looking forward to the future, it is a piece of darkness, I am sad for my future, I feel even more unreasonable and unsound of traditional education, so based on actual experience I wrote out the persecution of traditional education I received, to serve as a reference for educators across the country."</p>
<p>Seeing the Problems of Education but Having to Accuse</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's article points out that all levels of schools are preparing for entrance exams; "Elementary school is to prepare for entering middle school, the lessons taught in middle school are to prepare for entering university, and what about university? ... It is still aimed at you taking the exam to study abroad," "They are all dependent on the upper level, there is no independent personality of its own at all," and then criticizes the unreasonableness of the exam system, the inappropriateness of reciting "Entrance Examination Guide," "Applying for Zhe Nan," "Comprehensive Examination Guide," "Comprehensive Examination Essentials," and finally concludes that education is too far from real life, resulting in stepping out of the school gate, it is "perfunctory," "mixing rice," "feeling the pain of finding a job," and therefore said: "Really, our current school education, in addition to serving the rich to enter higher education, other is simply useless."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang and Mr. Gu have seen the problems of education, but all these problems should be attributed to education itself, which is really too wronged, we have to cry out for education, and have to make a defense.</p>
<p>Let us first defend Mr. Zhang's accusation. First, the entrance exams at all levels cannot shoulder the mission of selecting qualified young people, this statement only said half of it, not all of it, all countries in the world have more universities than middle schools, and more middle schools than elementary schools, China cannot be an exception. In the majority to choose the minority, there are only two ways, one is to hold entrance exams, the other is to be recommended by schools at a lower level, if only based on volunteers can enter higher education, not only can China not do it now, but even all countries in the world cannot do it. Recommendation has shortcomings, because the level of schools across the country is uneven, some schools with the best students, compared with other schools may be mediocre, people who handle school administration, especially people who handle educational administration, can know, so it is difficult to set an objective standard for recommended students. Holding entrance exams does have the problems pointed out by Mr. Zhang, but before a better way to select students is devised, entrance exams are still a more appropriate way. At present, schools recruit new students, and winter recruitment and recommendation are used together. According to the statistics of our school, the performance of the enrolled new students in the school is always better than that of the recommended students, and when we ask other schools, there are many of the same phenomena. The exam system has not been perfect, people who run education have the feeling of Canghai Yizhu, but those who "luck" are a minority after all, if it is said that the majority of good students can not enter higher education because there are entrance exams, and the majority of bad students have "luck" because there are entrance exams, then entrance exams can no longer be used. But what objective facts can prove it? Before a more perfect method of selecting students is invented, there is nothing wrong with combining entrance exams and recommendation system. As for how to improve the entrance exams, so that it can better shoulder the mission of selecting qualified young people, without destroying the body and mind of young people, without oppressing schools at a lower level, that is exactly the effort that the education sector should make.

<h3>Rice Market Arrivals Still Weak, Spot Prices Gradually Falling, Flour, Cooking Oil, Grains, and Rice Prices Decline</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, rice market arrivals remained weak, with only 1,414 shi. Normal trading within the market remained stagnant. In order to maintain food supplies for the people, the authorities further increased the amount of rice released, yesterday releasing a total of 13,655 shi of Wuhu machine-milled indica rice, distributed to 2,218 rice shops. Spot prices have gradually stabilized as the authorities have taken emergency measures to deal with the city's price problems, coupled with Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, which has calmed people's hearts. Moreover, the continuous surge in prices had reached its peak, and some owners, having achieved their desire for 3 million, were not hesitant to sell. Importers were also wary of these high prices and dared not purchase rashly. Therefore, yesterday's spot market trading saw all rice retreat below the 3 million mark. White japonica rice was at 2.9 million, thin indica rice at 2.85 million, and early rice retreated to 2.8 million, each falling by as much as 150,000.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Due to the decline in the rice market, efforts to revive it were weak. As soon as trading opened, strong selling pressure was evident, with retail investors selling one after another. Although wheat prices rose to 2 million, it was no longer enough to stimulate further increases. Yesterday's prices were already within limits, so spot trading changed to open trading in the market. Old Che brand flour retreated below the 1.4 million mark as soon as trading opened, falling as low as 1.38 million before closing at 1.39 million. Warship brand closed at 1.37 million, while Red Bee and Jiancheng brands were each down by 50,000 to 60,000 compared to the previous day, and bran was down by 30,000.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>A complete rout, with raw soybean oil and various other cooking oils all plummeting rapidly. This was because the continuous increases in recent days had been too great. Now that the rice market had collapsed, it was inevitably affected. Importers held back, and owners competed to sell. Oil factories also made sales, resulting in a chorus of "sell" voices. Factory soybean oil opened at 6.3 million, then 6.2 million (with plenty left). Dachang's new soybean oil was even lower at 6.15 million, and the lowest was Tongfeng's soybean oil at 6.1 million, a sharp drop of 600,000 to 700,000 compared to the previous day. Qingdao Jitung's raw oil fell to the 7 million mark, closing at 7.05 million, a reduction of 450,000. Raw rapeseed oil and the like all fell by 600,000 to 700,000, small cart sesame oil fell slightly by 500,000 to 600,000, and soybean cakes also saw a sharp drop, falling by 70,000 to 80,000.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>A general decline across the board. Hankou Zha beans opened in the morning, already falling to 1.6 million, down 150,000, and later falling to 1.55 million, a sharp drop of more than 10%. Sesame and mung beans followed, falling by 100,000. Raw peanuts arrived in large quantities, and Guangdong merchants did not come to pick them up, making the market sluggish and unable to recover. Nanjing raw peanuts opened at 3.4 million, a drop of as much as 500,000. Hand-picked green beans recovered slightly by 50,000. Only high-grade corn was in demand. Qidong corn opened at 2.2 million, an increase of 200,000, due to the Haizhou merchants actively exchanging for salt, making continuous efforts, and the market was not easy to decline. Corn from the central regions had already risen sharply in recent days, and yesterday's market price was no different.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The American President Lines' President Taft arrived from San Francisco with 55,500 bags of American rice. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and is currently unloading at China Merchants Bureau's Pier 6 (formerly Mitsubishi Pier). The rice is part of the China Trust Bureau's relief efforts.</p>
<p>The Huaqiang arrived from Dagu Xingang with more than 4,000 tons of coal. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is currently berthed at Kaiping Pier in Pudong for unloading. Additionally, the Nanqiang, carrying 6,700 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, was also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is expected to berth at Kailuan Pier for unloading.</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Hongzhang is scheduled to load 14,000 bags of relief flour from the Storage Department today for transport to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Sugar prices, which had been soaring in recent days, rising step by step, began to fall yesterday. The guild's quotation for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar fell by 250,000 to 350,000. No. 45 semi-white fell by 400,000 to 450,000. No. 20 medium granulated white saw a similar decrease. Other domestic sugars only had asking prices and no transactions were heard. However, according to Shantou telegrams, production prices are tight, and calculated costs are higher than Shanghai's market prices. Among sugar prices, green sugar is relatively stable and is not expected to decrease significantly in the short term. There are still many transactions in warehouse warrants, with prices fluctuating by 600,000 to 700,000. As a result, August contracts decreased by more than 400,000, and September contracts decreased by 380,000.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Weakens</h3>
<p>The tea market opened yesterday morning with continued enthusiasm due to price cuts by major sellers, revealing a sharp trend. However, due to widespread declines in other commodities, people's confidence also waned slightly. Until the close, apart from certain varieties that still managed to increase, the rest generally hovered around the same level. Domestic tea was like a fish in water, with buyers feeling that sales in the local area and in Suzhou and Wuxi were continuous. Activity remained enthusiastic. As for export tea, exporters found prices strangely high and were generally hesitant, and the situation remained calm as before.</p>
<h3>Firewood and Charcoal Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the firewood and charcoal market saw a sharp increase in demand as the price of kerosene continued to rise, and citizens mostly switched to using firewood and charcoal for fuel, resulting in brisk sales at the shops. At the opening, due to scarce arrivals and inventories, asking prices were unusually high. Chestnut firewood sold for 175,000 per dan, pine firewood for 145,000, green charcoal rose to 580,000 per dan, white charcoal to 510,000, and black charcoal to 440,000, a rise of about 15%.</p>
<h3>Timber Prices Soar</h3>
<p>In the timber market, due to the rise in foreign exchange and other commodities, opening prices also soared. Furthermore, due to purchases by construction firms and good retail sales, the market continued to increase. Five-fen pine planks rose to 1 million per zhang, one-zhang building planks sold for 750,000, four-fen red star pine planks for 550,000, foreign pine rose to 50,000 per foot, and fir wood to 12,000 to 13,000 per foot. Compared to the previous week, fir wood had almost doubled, foreign pine had increased by as much as 60%, and other goods had risen by 10% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Panic Selling Occurs Frequently, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Gradually Decline, 42-Count Fine Yarn Down 10 Million Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a decline in confidence due to the authorities' handling of cotton inventory registration and prohibition of movement. Adding to this was the opening of sales by the Textile Construction Company, leading to frequent panic selling. The market had risen sharply for several days, and prices had reached their peak, causing all parties to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Retail investors and market participants took the opportunity to sell at higher prices, and all levels of prices declined across the board. Eventually, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn closed at 120 million, a sharp drop of 10 million compared to the previous day. The remaining counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined uniformly, ranging from 300,000 to 3.45 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with a decline, and rumors circulated that the authorities would take strict measures against the current chaotic situation in various markets, thoroughly investigate all illegal trading activities, prohibit free trading of cotton, and restrict movement. The public panicked, and long positions competed to sell. Selling pressure unfolded in the market, and prices gradually declined. Eventually, 12-pound Dragon Head and other grades of fine cloth fell by 40,000 to 80,000 compared to the previous day. In addition, serge, direct tribute bleached cloth, and other prices also followed suit and declined. However, colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained strong due to firm factory prices, and the market remained lively.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual yesterday. The company offered 1,759 pieces, equivalent to 3,011 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 598 purchase applications. The Yarn Control Committee offered 378 pieces, equivalent to about 600 pieces of 20-count yarn, with 107 purchase applications.</p>
<p>The opening prices for each count of yarn were: 20-count Golden Double Chicken at 64 million, 6-count Deputy Sunlight at 35 million, 10-count Standing Horse at 39 million, 32-count Yanghe at 85 million, 40-count Baoguang at 95 million, 42-count Baoguang at 105 million, and 60-count Sunlight at 190 million.</p>
<h3>Cotton Trade Halt Free Purchase</h3>
<p>The cotton industry in this city, starting yesterday, has followed orders to halt free purchase and sale, hence yesterday Lingbao cotton, Shashi cotton, Hankou fine cotton, Tongzhou fine cotton, and other domestic cottons were without trade, there were no black market transactions found throughout the day. However, cotton merchants and others have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with this move by the Flower Control Committee. They have also expressed to all sectors that the authorities' prohibition of free cotton trading is tantamount to causing all employees in the industry to be unemployed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Flower Yarn Cloth Management Committee's thorough investigation of cotton storage in various warehouses is scheduled to begin today. At the same time, the customs office is notified that all newly imported cotton will also be registered.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Continues to Soar</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric market prices, affected by the soaring prices of rice, silk yarn, and daily necessities, all continued to rise. Yuansao Xiexin's branded Western-style flannel was selling for 2.56 million per yard, Zhanghua's pure plate for 2.25 million, Shanghai Textile Woolen Flannel for 3.4 million, medium-thick serge for 1.5 million to 1.9 million, Xuanwei for 1.85 million to 2.2 million, Yinfeng Huanghuada flannel for 2.3 million, dark blue and grass green for 1.8 million, Dalong thin plain serge for 1.1 million, mixed color flannel for 1.85 million, dyed flannel for 1.4 million, and Qinfen gray French flannel for 1.35 million.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Raw Silk Exports, India Ranked First</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the China Trust Bureau, India was the top destination for raw silk exports last year, followed by Burma, the United Kingdom ranked third, and the United States ranked fourth. Among the export quantities, the United States had 1,350 dan, but 1,200 of these were consignment sales. As of now, the total export volume is 4,123 dan, and domestic sales are 1,525 dan, for a total of 5,648 dan. Silk fabric exports have been limited since India banned imports, although other countries can still trade, but the numbers are small, so the future is bleak. The Silk Fabric Export Association, which was responsible for assisting in promotion, has been ordered to close, but raw silk sales to India have increased, as India is now focusing on importing raw materials and weaving silk fabrics themselves.</p>
<h3>December Last Year, Statistics of Silver and Money Industry Deposits</h3>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Fight Each Other and Fluctuate Unpredictably</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yong Yarn in Chinese stocks stopped new trading outside the market, and many settled their positions. Long and short positions fought each other, and prices fluctuated unpredictably. Meyer, Guohuo, Jinglun, Yongye, and Lianhua all rose to the limit, and miscellaneous stocks had a tendency to replace them.</p>
<p>In the morning, except for Jinglun, which still opened high, and Guohuo, which was slightly stronger, the remaining stocks all opened lower due to the Chairman's return to Nanjing. Yong Yarn appeared at prices of 1,075 yuan and 1,080 yuan, and after opening, No. 116 and other advances were delivered immediately, No. 76 and other advances were delivered later, rising to high prices of 1,115 yuan and 1,135 yuan.

The crackdown outside the market was even tighter, and there was news that Hengshu was about to stop wash trading. Near noon, the trend was still up and down, and the market outside the exchange even crashed earlier. Yong Yarn closed at noon, retreating to 1,060 yuan and 1,100 yuan. The current advance is further away. Except for Jinglun Guohuo, which is supported by actual backing and still stands at a high level, the rest are also declining.

<h3>Domestic Medicine Production Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The domestic medicine market situation, sales of various stomach medications were flat, and Sichuan products reported price increases via telegraph, and in addition, shipping costs and surcharges were extremely high, Shanghai inventory was scarce, and the aftermarket is expected to rise. Due to the rising exchange rate, foreign goods from Guangdong were not sold by Hakka. Yesterday's Hong Kong telegram was Guangdong Pi at 33 million, Buddha's Hand Slices at 32 million, Qingjia Slices at 12 million, and Fangji at 3.6 million.</p>
<h3>Tea Export Industry Association Telegrammed Opinions on This Year's Tea Loan, Please Lend in Three Installments According to Last Year's Case</h3>
<p>Tea is an important export commodity, and the government has been doing its best to support the industry in recent years. The current year is also under planning. The Tea Export Industry Association, feeling pressed by the tea season, had previously submitted a telegraphic request to the Joint Treasury on the 20th of this month, asking for a quick decision on the tea loan plan. The association has now telegraphed the Joint Treasury again, stating its loan opinions:</p>
<p>The association believes that this year's domestic tea quantity, excluding Taiwan, is estimated to be more than 240,000 dan in various regions. According to the usual practice in each region, the harvesting and production of tea is always converted according to rice prices, with each dan of raw tea being approximately equal to three dan of rice. Temporarily calculated as two and a half dan, plus refining, packaging, and requisitions, etc., it is approximately equal to one and a half dan of rice. In total, the average cost of each dan of boxed tea from various regions to Shanghai requires the equivalent of six dan of rice. In order to increase the production of export goods and subsidize foreign exchange income, the association specifically offers four points of opinion on this year's tea goods based on the consensus of the industry.</p>
<p>(1) For this year's harvesting and production of export boxed tea, except for tea factory equipment, all are the responsibility of tea merchants and are not included in the cost calculation. The tea production cost is calculated according to the above-mentioned total cost. Please handle it in accordance with the silk loan method, with tea merchants funding 10% and government loans 90%.</p>
<p>(2) The government loan portion should be handled in accordance with the 36th year case, and lent in three installments. The first installment is for raw tea processing loans, accounting for 50% of the total cost, with a deadline of one month for refining. The second installment loan accounts for 20% of the total cost, and the third installment loan accounts for 20% of the total cost.</p>
<p>(3) The term of the mortgage loan is set at three months. If the market stagnates or exports cannot be met, please extend it for two months. Upon expiration, please consider the actual difficulties of the tea merchants and purchase them, and protect the legitimate profits that the tea merchants should receive.</p>
<p>(4) The interest on the boxed tea mortgage should be calculated according to the 36th year method, and the tea merchant's industry guarantee should be approved.</p>
<p>The estimated production scenery of tea in various regions this year is 241,000 dan. Qihong 20,000 dan, Tunlv 30,000 dan, Pinglv 70,000 dan, Wenhong 7,000 dan, Wenlv 8,000 dan, Minhong 25,000 dan, Minlv 15,000 dan, Xianghong 20,000 dan, Ehong 5,000 dan, Ninghong 10,000 dan, Wu (Yuan) 15,000 dan, He (Kou) Hong 3,000 dan, Yulv 5,000 dan, and Suilv 8,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Allocation Prices Expected to Improve, Centralized Quotations Simplify Procedures</h3>
<p>Since the Textile Construction Company changed the price negotiation for cotton yarn allocation to quotation the day before yesterday, and the verified prices have soared, the textile industry has complained. A responsible person had discussed with Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee and General Vice Manager Shu Wu of the Textile Construction Company, and they all agreed that the lack of flexibility in the original price negotiation was necessary to improve. Regarding the recent quotation method, each factory submits a quotation for bidding, but the allocation price is determined separately by the Textile Construction Company, so purchasers cannot know the yarn price in advance, quoters are worried about gains and losses, and accountants cannot be detailed. There is no market for pricing, and the allocation price is like revealing a mystery, the procedures are confusing, and people are stimulated, and the textile industry believes that it must be further improved. Chairman Yuan said that quotations do not have to be submitted by each household separately. If each industry can appoint a responsible representative to handle the quotation with the Textile Construction Company, they can negotiate the allocation price with the yarn allocation agency. Simplifying procedures is also feasible. The Textile Construction authorities are still considering this. However, it has stated that it will strive to rationalize allocation prices and increase allocation volumes. Yesterday (the 27th), the machine dyeing and weaving industry formally presented a report to the Yarn Control Committee, suggesting improvements to the current quotation method.</p>
<h3>The Rebirth and Support of Taiwan Coal</h3>
<p>Talking about the rebirth and support of Taiwan coal, the first thing to mention is the domestic coal supply and demand problem. Originally, the coal used in major cities along the southeast coast of our country relied on the supply from major mines in the north. Since the communists have stepped up their disturbances in the north, the output of various mines has been reduced sharply, or has fallen into stagnation, or transportation has been blocked, resulting in a serious coal shortage in various places such as Beijing, Shanghai, and South China. Therefore, the status of Taiwan coal in the domestic market is becoming more and more important, and the expectation of various parties for the increased production of Taiwan coal is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>A Heavy Responsibility and A Long Way to Go</p>
<p>The supply of Taiwan coal is currently shouldering a task that is both heavy and far-reaching. Every employee engaged in the coal mining industry is calmly working hard for this difficult task. Its supply range can be divided into two parts: domestic sales and foreign sales. The main users in the province are railways and various publicly-owned industries. The largest demand comes from the sugar, paper, cement, machinery, kiln, textile, tobacco and alcohol, and camphor industries. All areas outside the province are under the unified control of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Qingdao. In terms of domestic sales, there has been a significant increase due to the accelerated recovery of industry in the province. For example, in the sugar industry, sugar production last year was only more than 30,000 tons, but this year it has increased sharply to more than 300,000 tons. The coal used for sugar production this period will require more than 100,000 tons. The current is in the sugar production season, and the coal quota for the sugar industry alone is 30,000 tons per month. The sharp increase in coal demand in the sugar industry has another reason besides the increase in sugar production. In the past, sugar factories used bagasse as boiler fuel, but now the pulp manufacturing part of the Zihui Paper Company has resumed operation, and this bagasse can be used in large quantities as a raw material for manufacturing pulp, solving the current raw material needs. Therefore, the fuel originally borne by bagasse must also be replenished by coal. In terms of the cement industry, last year's output was only more than 12,000 tons per month, but now it has reached 20,000 tons per month, and the amount of coal used has also increased from 5,000 to 6,000 tons per month to more than 10,000 tons. The amount of coal used by various other industries and transportation has also gradually increased. The monthly quota for domestic coal sales has increased from more than 100,000 tons three months ago to the current 105,000 tons, and will continue to increase with the long-term progress of industrial recovery. Although this is an excellent phenomenon in the industrial sector, the coal mining industry feels increasingly burdened. Regarding the amount of coal for foreign sales, Taiwan has always tried its best to supply it. In the entire year of the 36th year, a total of 431,875 tons were exported. After consultation between Taiwan Province and the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a measurement was made based on the needs of the province and abroad. It should first be supplied to the province and then to other provinces, because the province uses coal to increase production. As a result, it is temporarily set at 40,000 tons per month for export. According to officials in Taiwan Province: They are extremely concerned about the urgent need for coal in Beijing and Shanghai. In the future, in addition to supplying the necessary quantity in the province, they will try their best to transport it out, hoping to exceed the currently temporarily set number of 40,000 tons per month.</p>
<p>Highest Production</p>
<p>Under such a heavy burden, will the output of coal production be able to cope with it happily? According to past circumstances, before 1937 during the Japanese occupation, the annual output of Taiwan coal averaged between 1.5 million and 1.8 million metric tons, which is between 120,000 and 150,000 tons per month. At that time, there was no worry about the lack of materials, transportation was smooth, and profits were stable. All kinds of conditions were much better than they are now, and the prosperity of coal production was an inevitable result. By the end of the war, the Japanese actively increased production, reaching an annual output of 2.8 million tons in 1941. However, this was destructive production. In order to seek temporary relief, the Japanese even mined the coal pillars, which caused the current difficulty in lowering coal. From 1942 to around the time of restoration, coal production has fallen year by year to more than 30,000 tons per month. After the government's continuous efforts, in the 35th year of the Republic of China, more than 1,005,500 tons were produced, and in the 36th year it increased again to more than 1.3 million tons, averaging 110,000 tons per month. Although current production conditions are so poor, it has reached 70% of the output during the Japanese occupation. This year's production plan is 2 million metric tons for the whole year. In January, it has increased sharply to 145,000 tons, creating the highest record since the restoration. If there are no unexpected difficulties, it is not difficult to achieve the highest ideal, and the amount of coal for foreign sales may exceed the fixed amount of 40,000 tons per month.

<p>Literary History</p>
<h3>The History of Collating the *Shui Jing Zhu* Can Illustrate the Methods of Textual Criticism</h3>
<p>— Hu Shi</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, when I wrote the preface to Mr. Chen Yuan's "Annotations and Supplements to Yuan Dian Zhang," I broadly discussed the methods of textual criticism. I said, "Using a good version for collation is the soul of textual criticism and the only way to achieve it. ... For missing text, misplaced slips, inverted pages, unseen personal or place names, or unseen ancient or vulgar characters, there is no way to guess without collation."</p>
<p>"The most refined reasoning (such as that of Wang Niansun and Duan Yucai) can often compensate for the deficiencies of versions. The true meaning of textual criticism lies in mutual comparison of copies. Although the search for copies is opened and great effort is spent on careful analysis, this is ultimately not the proper path of textual criticism."</p>
<p>This article (collected in the first volume of Hu Shi's Recent Academic Works, pages 135 to 148) caused quite a bit of protest at the time because criticizing Wang Niansun and Duan Yucai, saying that they were not on the right path of textual criticism, was not easily acceptable to orthodox scholars. However, the method of textual criticism I spoke of is actually the method recognized by all textual critics. For example, Mr. Chen Yuan collated the *Yuan Dian Zhang* and supplemented more than 102 missing pages. Can reasoning-based textual criticism supplement even half a missing page?</p>
<p>I will now use the history of scholars in the Ming and Qing dynasties revising the *Shui Jing Zhu* to illustrate that good versions for collation are indeed the soul of textual criticism.</p>
<p>The *Shui Jing Zhu* engraved by Huang Shengzeng (Jiajing 12th year, 1534 AD) has ten major defects:</p>
<p>(1) No preface by Li Daoyuan</p>
<p>(2) Volume 1 has one misplaced slip</p>
<p>(3) Volume 2 has one misplaced slip</p>
<p>(4) Volumes 9 and 13 each have two mutually misplaced slips</p>
<p>(5) Volume 22, the Ying River section, has one misplaced slip</p>
<p>(6) Volume 22, the Qu River section, has one misplaced slip</p>
<p>(7) Volume 30 has one misplaced slip</p>
<p>(8) Volume 18 is missing the second slip</p>
<p>(9) Volume 18 is missing the last slip of eighty-five characters at the end.</p>
<p>(10) Volume 31 is missing one slip, misplaced in Volume 33, the Yangtze River section.</p>
<p>These ten major defects were not corrected by Wu Guan's collated and engraved version (Wanli 13th year, 1585), because he had not seen any other good versions for comparison.</p>
<p>Zhu Mouwei (Wanli 43rd year, 1615) used Xie Zhaoshen's "Song Version" (presumably a hand-copied Song version) and corrected six of the ten defects:</p>
<p>The misplaced slip in Volume 1.</p>
<p>The misplaced slip in Volume 2.</p>
<p>The misplaced slips in Volumes 9 and 13.</p>
<p>The misplaced slip in Volume 30.</p>
<p>The last slip of five lines in Volume 18</p>
<p>The missing slip in Volume 31</p>
<p>Zhu Mouwei attempted to collate and correct the misplaced slip in Volume 22, the Ying River section, but no matter how he revised it, it was still wrong and unreadable. He did not even notice the misplaced slip in the Qu River section.</p>
<p>By the ninth year of Qianlong (1744), Quan Zuwang and Zhao Yiqing borrowed Sun Qian's collated version from the Ma family of Yangzhou. Sun Qian used Liu Qian's hand-copied Song version to collate Zhu Mouwei's version. Liu Qian's Song version had four major advantages over Xie Zhaoshen's Song version:</p>
<p>(1) It had two-thirds of Li Daoyuan's preface, missing only half a slip.</p>
<p>(2) The Ying River section did not have a misplaced slip.</p>
<p>(3) The Ying River section did not have a misplaced slip.</p>
<p>(4) Volume 18 had the second slip. Quan and Zhao used Sun Qian's copy of Liu Qian's version to collate the *Shui Jing Zhu*, and thus three and two-thirds of the four major defects left by Zhu Mouwei were unexpectedly supplemented, leaving only one-third of Li's preface missing.</p>
<p>In the thirtieth year of Qianlong (1765), Dai Zhen had not yet seen the *Yongle Encyclopedia* version, but he also wanted to collate and correct the defects left by Zhu Mouwei. He wanted to correct the misplaced slip in the Ying River section and also wanted to correct the missing text in Volume 18 (Wei River section). He did not know that the Ying River section was missing an entire slip, nor did he know that the Wei River section was missing an entire slip. The results of his corrections are preserved in the "Attached Examinations" in his self-collated *Shui Jing* one-volume edition (one copy in the Peking University Library and another in the Zhou family collection of Jiande). In both of these places, his correction work failed because he had not seen a copy that was older and more complete than those of Huang Shengzeng and Xie Zhaoshen. Zhen also did not know that the Qu River section was missing an entire slip!</p>
<p>In the thirty-eighth year of Qianlong (1773), Dai Zhen saw the *Shui Jing Zhu* in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* at the Siku Library. This version was more complete than those of Huang and Xie and even more complete than Liu Qian's version. The four major advantages of Liu Qian's version were all present in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* version. The Guan's preface to Liu Qian's version was missing a full half-slip, but this preface was completely intact in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* version. Therefore, between the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth years of Qianlong, Dai Zhen completely corrected all ten major defects of Huang Shengzeng's version.</p>
<p>For all such major defects, without ancient versions available for comparison, even with exceptional intelligence and extraordinary effort, satisfactory collation cannot be achieved. Zhu Mouwei's and Dai Zhen's collation of the misplaced slips in the Ying River, and Dai Zhen's supplement to the missing slip in the Wei River, are all the most beneficial lessons in textual criticism.</p>
<p>From the engraving of Huang Shengzeng's version to the collation of the *Shui Jing Zhu* in the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, a full two hundred and forty years passed. Of the ten major defects left by Huang's engraved version, Zhu Mouwei corrected six, Quan Zuwang and Zhao Yiqing corrected nine and two-thirds, and Dai Zhen corrected all ten. These are all the achievements of collating with good versions. (37, 2, 18 midnight)</p>
<h3>Pure Talk and Pure Criticism</h3>
<p>— Tang Changru</p>
<p>According to the general interpretation, "pure talk" is a kind of abstract and profound discussion, while "pure criticism" is practical criticism of individuals. The connotations of the two seem to be inconsistent. However, according to the statements of people in the late Han and Three Kingdoms periods, the so-called "pure talk" at that time, before the emergence of metaphysics, was not strictly different from "pure criticism." In other words, it was practical criticism of individuals. The *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 1, Note to the *Biography of Emperor Wu*, quotes Zhang Fan's *Han Ji* and Zheng Tai's account of Dong Zhuo (same as Fan Ye's *Book of the Later Han*, Volume 100, *Biography of Zheng Tai*):</p>
<p>"Kong Gongxu is capable of pure talk and lofty discussions, breathing life into the withered and blowing life away."</p>
<p>Also, Volume 7, Note to the *Biography of Zang Hong*, quotes *Spring and Autumn of the Nine Provinces* on Jiao He:</p>
<p>"In private, one sees his pure talk reaching the clouds, but in public, he is chaotic, and his fate is unknowable." (Similar to Yuan Hong's *Book of the Later Han*, Volume 26)</p>
<p>These two entries are the earliest to use the term "pure talk." We do not know the content of Jiao He's pure talk, but Kong Zhong's talk had the effect of "breathing life into the withered and blowing life away." Li Xian's commentary to the *Biography of Zheng Tai* in the *Book of the Later Han* states:</p>
<p>"Breathing on the withered to make it live, and blowing on the living to make it wither, means that the talk and discussion has its own emphases and suppressions."</p>
<p>Discussions with emphases and suppressions are also criticisms of people (or affairs). Later generations have not completely lost the original meaning of the "blowing and breathing" idiom, but have only emphasized the "praising" aspect. *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 13, Note to the *Biography of Zhong Yu*:</p>
<p>"Sun Quan submitted as a vassal and sent the head of Guan Yu. When the Crown Prince wrote to Ji, Ji replied: 'Your servant's fellow district man, former Secretary Gou Shuang, said:</p>
<p>People should follow their emotions. Those who love me, how lovable they are; those who hate me, how hateful they are. Thinking of Sun Quan, I find him even more charming.' The Crown Prince wrote again: 'I am pleased to know that the South has submitted. As for Master Xun's pure talk and Sun Quan's charm, I hold the letter, panting and gasping, unable to let it go. If Quan becomes black again, I will break him with Xu Shao's monthly criticism of Runan. Quan's leisurely dealings with the two kingdoms, bowing to Xun and Xu, is enough.'"</p>
<p>Cao Pi considered Xun Shuang's words to be "pure talk," naturally unrelated to the later emerging metaphysics. Xu Shao's monthly criticism of Runan was a famous criticism of individuals, and by mentioning it together, it can be seen that there was some connection. I think Zhong Yu and Cao Pi meant to say that there are two kinds of critical attitudes: Xun Shuang's is subjective, using love and hate as the standard, while Xu Shao's is objective, using actions as the standard. If love and hate are used as the standard, then Sun Quan is charming; if actions are used as the standard, then the evaluation of Sun Quan must change at any time. Therefore, although Xun Shuang's words were not a concrete criticism of a person, they were related to it. As to whether Xun Shuang said this intentionally or as a jest is another matter.</p>
<p>There are two more examples of "pure talk" being used interchangeably with "pure criticism" in the *Book of Jin*. *Book of Jin*, Volume 44, *Zheng Mao with appended sons Mo and Fu*:</p>
<p>"Initially, the Emperor (Emperor Wu of Jin) wanted to select a nobleman for an official position. No one in the village dared to serve in the military. He sought one within the state. Therefore, the impartial administrators of twelve districts all recommended Mo. When Emperor Wu went to worship in the southern suburbs, he ordered Mo to ride alongside him and said to Mo, '...In the past, the state selected you as a minister. I am always ashamed to burden pure talk." *Ibid*, Volume 45, *Biography of Liu Yi*, Sun Yin's memorial recommending Yi as the impartial administrator of Ru'nan states:</p>
<p>"In this state, only Yi is outstanding in virtue. If Yi is not employed, then pure criticism will be overturned."</p>
<p>Although the *Book of Jin* was revised by Tang Dynasty people, the first entry appears in the *Classified Collection of Literary Works*, Volume 48, quoting Wang Yin's *Book of Jin*. The second entry is a memorial, which historians rarely change when abridging. Therefore, both can be believed to be statements from the Jin Dynasty. The "pure talk" in these two entries is actually "pure criticism." The second entry makes it even clearer. The duty of the impartial administrator was originally to preside over pure criticism, so it is said that if Liu Yi were not employed, pure criticism would inevitably be overturned.</p>
<p>In the Jin Dynasty, "pure talk" and "pure criticism" could no longer be confused, but in practice, people still occasionally used the terminology of the previous era. A few such occasional examples can still be found in historical records. *Book of Liang*, Volume 53, *Biography of Shen Yue*:</p>
<p>"Taking advantage of the times and relying on power, he greatly burdened pure talk."</p>
<p>*Ibid*, Volume 21, *Biographies of Wang and Chen*: "Prince of Shian, Yaoguang's memorial recommending Chen and Wang Sengru states:</p>
<p>'If you strive for a high position, you should still be judged by pure talk.'"</p>
<p>*Ibid*, Volume 50, *Biography of Fu Ting*, Ting's letter to Xu Mian states:</p>
<p>"In the past, Zijian did not want to rashly praise Chen Lin, fearing that he would be ridiculed by later generations. The extravagant discussions of today will perhaps not have clear talk."</p>
<p>*History of the Southern Dynasties*, Volume 41, *Earl of Nanfeng, Xiao Chifu with appended son Yingda*:</p>
<p>"The seventh son, Ji, became the governor of Weixing in the early Taiqing period, prefect of Liang Province...Liang Province has an ancient tomb called Jianjian, which is said to be Zhang Qian's tomb... (Ji opened it). At the time, he was in mourning for his mother, and was condemned by pure talk."</p>
<p>The above four examples all use "pure talk" as "pure criticism." It can be seen that this usage still existed in the later Southern Dynasties, although it was only a literary imitation and the facts had already diverged in meaning.</p>
<p>The evolution of this terminology can also be inferred to be a continuous development of thought from the Han to the Wei and Jin dynasties.</p>
<p>Celebrated figures in the Eastern Han dynasty, such as Jia Kui, criticized people, promoting the virtuous and censuring the wicked, meaning that their criticism of politics was also focused on people. The standard for criticism was the "moral teachings" promoted by Confucianism. *Book of Song*, Volume 64, *Biography of Zheng Xianzhi*, states: "The greatest principle of moral teachings is loyalty and filial piety." Therefore, people's character was measured by Confucian moral tenets. If they did not meet the standard, they would be scorned and violate pure criticism. However, there were also priorities in moral teachings, which had to be discussed. Thus, topics such as "the priority of benevolence and filial piety" and "loyalty and filial piety cannot coexist" arose. These kinds of topics could also be heard in the pure talk of the Wei and Jin dynasties, although they were not the main part of pure talk.</p>
<p>Since the Han people used morality as the standard for criticizing people, they inevitably neglected the aspect of talent. In times of peace, emphasizing virtue over talent did not cause any problems, but in the great chaos of the late Han, it was felt that people of pure morality were not necessarily capable of restoring order. Cao Cao resolutely put forward the slogan "only talent should be recommended," which is something everyone knows. Thus, the debate about talent and nature arose. Wang Chong's *Lunheng*, *On Human Nature* chapter, already said, "Human nature has good and evil, just as talent has high and low." The Han people advocated "sharing the purity of the good and sharing the filth of the evil." From Fan Pang's words in the *Book of Han*, *Biography of Party and Gang*, they completely focused on the aspect of nature and the expression of nature. Cao Cao, however, turned this around and focused on the aspect of talent and the expression of talent. *Shi Shuo Xin Yu*, *Literary Studies* chapter, note quoting the *Wei Zhi*:</p>
<p>"(Zhong) Hui's treatises on the similarities and differences between talent and nature were passed down to the world. There were four versions: talent and nature are the same, talent and nature are different, talent and nature are united, and talent and nature are separated. Shangshu Zhuan Zhou argued for sameness, Zhongshuling Li Feng argued for difference, Shilang Zhong Hui argued for unity, and Tunqi Xiaowei Wang Guang argued for separation." Although the four treatises on talent and nature have been lost, it can be inferred that their content was nothing more than theories of personal criticism. *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 22, *Lu Yu Biography*:</p>
<p>"Yu, in his assessment of people and selection of officials, always considered character and conduct first and then spoke of talent. Huangmen Li Feng once asked Yu about this. Yu said, 'Talent is the means by which one does good. Therefore, great talent achieves great good, and small talent achieves small good. If one is called talented but cannot do good, it means that their talent is not suited to the task.' Feng and others were convinced by his words."</p>
<p>Li was discussing the difference between talent and nature, so he did not agree with Lu Yu's standard of "character and conduct first, then talent" for selecting and criticizing officials. Although Lu Yu was not one of the four theorists, his argument clearly united talent and nature and applied the theory of personal criticism to political affairs. It can be seen that the four theses on talent and nature debated by the pure talkers also inherited or opposed the standards of criticism between the Han and Wei dynasties.</p>
<p>The discussions of Zhong Hui, Jia Kui, and others were called the "study of names and principles" at the time. *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Volume 10, Note to the *Biography of Xun Yu* dividing the biographies of He Shao and Xun Can:</p>
<p>"Can once said to (Zhuan) Zhou, 'You and others will surely surpass me in worldly affairs and fame, but your understanding is inferior to mine.' Zhou challenged him, saying, 'It is understanding that enables great success and fame. Who in the world has a deficiency in the root but an abundance in the branches?' Can said, 'Success and fame are rewards for ambition and scope. In that case, ambition and scope are one thing in themselves and not achieved solely by understanding. I can make you wealthy, but I may not be equal to what you do.'"</p>
<p>This passage discusses the separation and unity of "ambition" and "understanding" and is also a study of names and principles. The study of names and principles is a kind of learning for criticizing people.</p>
<p>The main topic of the pure talkers was ultimately the "debate between being and non-being" or the similarities and differences between moral teachings and nature. This topic certainly concluded in ultimate righteousness and had broad implications that cannot be limited to personal criticism. However, the earliest intention of pitting nature against moral teachings was still related to this. The Han people regarded moral teachings as their refuge, but in the Wei and Jin dynasties, they became tools for political manipulation, used to eliminate dissidents and flatter the authorities. Therefore, some people who were unwilling to cooperate with the authorities proposed "nature" from Taoist doctrines as an alternative. They established themselves with a different standard and used it to criticize people. The story of He Zeng wanting to kill Ruan Ji is well known. Regardless of whether He Zeng could practice the moral teachings he advocated himself, or whether Ruan Ji truly despised moral teachings, He Zeng's criticism of Ruan Ji was based on moral teachings, while Ruan Ji's self-presentation was that of a transcendent. It was still a difference in the standards of personal criticism. *Book of Jin*, Volume 49, *Ruan Ji Biography*:</p>
<p>"Pei Kai went to mourn him (when Ji was in mourning for his mother). Ji let his hair down and sat with his legs apart, drunk and staring straight ahead. Kai finished mourning and left. Someone asked Kai, 'Usually, the host cries and the guest follows the etiquette. Ji did not cry, so why did you cry?' Kai said, 'Ruan Ji is a transcendent, so he does not adhere to ritual and etiquette. I am a man of the mundane world, so I abide by norms and regulations.' People at the time admired them both for getting it right."</p>
<p>The reason people at the time admired them both for getting it right was because they used two different standards to criticize Pei and Ruan. The *Biography of Ruan Ji* also says, "Ji's speech was profound and distant, and he did not praise or criticize people." Of course, this was one of his ways to avoid disaster, but since he dared to openly resist the moral teachings advocated by the ruler, this was all the more likely to bring disaster. It can be seen that it was not entirely for avoiding disaster. He often used blue and white eyes to express his attitude, so how could he not have praised or criticized?</p>
<p>In summary, although "pure talk" and "pure criticism" went their separate ways in later generations and cannot be confused, judging from the topics of the pure talkers, pure talk was actually nurtured from pure criticism.</p>
<h3>On the History of Nanzhao</h3>
<p>— Xiang Da</p>
<p>—A Brief Study of Tang Dynasty Records of Nanzhao—</p>
<p>In the sixth month of the fifth year of Xiantong, he was appointed as the Chief Clerk of the Governor-General's Office of Kuizhou. He inquired about the origins of the Man, Yi, Ba, and Xia four cities and recorded them all, sending them to the major chieftains of Annam, recording them in detail in this work, the Man Zhi in ten volumes, so that one may know the order of events from beginning to end concerning the southern barbarians.</p>
<p>This passage may be the author's preface, misplaced here. The name of the *Man Shu* varies among different books. The *New Book of Tang*, *Treatise on Literature*, *Comprehensive Mirror*, *Old Anecdotes*, Cheng Dachang's *Yu Gong Lun*, and Cai Shen's *Book of Documents, Collection of Commentaries* call it *Man Shu*; Jun Zhai's *Reading Records*, the *History of the Song Dynasty*, *Treatise on Literature*, the Yuan Dynasty's Li Jing's *Yunnan Zhi Lue*, and the early Ming Dynasty's Cheng Benli call it *Yunnan Zhi*; the *History of the Song Dynasty* also mentions Fan Chuo's *Southern Barbarian Records*, both in ten volumes; Su Song's *Illustrated Materia Medica* calls it *Yunnan Ji*; the *Yongle Encyclopedia* calls it *Yunnan Shi Ji*; and the *Taiping Yulan* calls it *Southern Yi Zhi*. The *Complete Library in Four Sections* records the name according to the *New Book of Tang*. According to Fan Chuo's own statement in the *Man Shu*, calling it the *Man Zhi* in ten volumes, it seems that the name recorded in the *New Book of Tang* is closer to the truth. The *Man Shu* continued to circulate after the Song Dynasty. Li Jing's preface to the *Yunnan Zhi Lue* mentions this book by Fan Chuo. In the early Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, Cheng Benli was appointed as the Yunnan Administrator. In Lijiang, he saw Fan Chuo's *Yunnan Zhi* in the hands of Prefect Zhang and this event was recorded in the *Record of a Western Journey to Yunnan* in the *Collected Works of Mr. Xunyin*. Since it was included in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* during the Yongle period, the book was no longer transmitted, so the *Summary of the Complete Library in Four Sections* says "Even someone as erudite as Yang Shen said that Chuo's book existed only in record, not in book form." As for Volume 2 and Volume 3 of the *Wanli Yunnan Tongzhi*, although both quote Fan Chuo's *Yunnan Zhi*, the text is quite different from the extant book and more like the language of later local chronicles. It is feared that this is a misinterpretation of hearsay, and Fan's book had already been lost by the mid-Ming Dynasty. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, when compiling the *Complete Library in Four Sections*, the officials first compiled Fan's book from the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, dividing it into ten volumes according to the *Treatise on Literature* in the *New Book of Tang*, and collating it with the *Biography of Nanzhao* in the *New Book of Tang* and the *Corrections to the Comprehensive Mirror*. The *Man Shu* then circulated in the world again. In addition to the *Complete Library in Four Sections* edition, there is the Wuying Hall Precious Edition, the Tonghua Hall edition of the Qianlong period, Wang Zhiyi's Zhenqi Hall edition, the Guangya Press Precious Edition Congxiao Edition, the Linlang Secret Chamber Series edition, the Jianxi Village Hermitage edition, and the Yunnan Beizheng Zhi edition, totaling seven versions. The Tonghua Hall edition and those that followed are all derived from the Wuying Hall Precious Edition; but the Hall Edition, Tonghua Hall Edition, and Zhenqi Hall Edition are rarely seen. The Hall Edition probably comes from the Wen Yuan Ge Siku, the summary written in the second month of the thirty-ninth year of Qianlong, the earliest time; the Wen Jin was in the forty-ninth year, and the Wen Su was in the forty-seventh year, the texts of the two summaries being the same, but differing from the Hall Edition, and the texts inside the book also having slight differences. We now surmise that most of the *Man Shu* in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* was included in one rhyme, so Mr. Zhao Wanli, who saw the most of the *Yongle Encyclopedia* in China, did not see the *Man Shu* being quoted, and Mr. Wang Zhongmin, who saw the most of the *Yongle Encyclopedia* abroad, saw only one entry; it is likely that the volume of the Encyclopedia that quoted the *Man Shu* was lost in the Boxer Rebellion, or at some unknown time.</p>
<p>Because the original Encyclopedia no longer exists, there is no way to correct any errors in the Complete Library edition. However, from the annotations of the Complete Library officials, we can still see that some places in the current Man Shu were mistakenly changed by the officials, such as: in the current edition, Volume 4 begins with the record of Cuan Gui killing Gai Pin and Gai Qi, father and son. In the Yongle Encyclopedia, Gai Pin and Gai Qi are written as Meng Ke and Meng Qi, and the officials corrected it according to the New Book of Tang. However, in Zhang Jiuling's Collected Works, in the edict to Annam Ren Zhe, there is a Meng Pin, magistrate of Shengma County, from which we can know that the New Book of Tang mistakenly wrote Meng as Gai. The Encyclopedia's Meng is not mistaken, only Meng Pin is mistakenly written as Meng Ke. The Complete Library officials failed to widely consult Tang books, resulting in this error. Also, the Southern Yi Zhi quoted in the Imperial Readings is another name for the Man Shu, and there are many places where it can collate and supplement the current edition. For example, at the end of the Stone Gate Road section in Volume 1, the phrase large tribes has what would be the ghost below, the text is missing, making it unintelligible. The South Clip Record quoted in the entries on the tribes of the wild Man of the 7th, 8th, and 9th riots is exactly the current text of this section, with complete text. The officials did not know how to utilize it, resulting in many regrets remaining in the current edition. In addition, there are many misplaced slips in the original Encyclopedia, such as the 58 characters at the end of the Dujin Man entry in the current Volume 4, which are not relevant to the context, and the 52 characters at the beginning of Volume 5, which are not related to the following text. The entry at the end of Volume 8 should not be in the Customs section; these are all misplaced slips. The officials' indications of where these misplaced slips should be are all very reasonable. Therefore, although the current edition of the Man Shu survives thanks to the Encyclopedia, it still needs to be carefully collated and restored. Among the three hundred years of empirical research during the Qing Dynasty, research on the history of southern regions was too bleak.</p>
<p>The Secretarial Division divides it into the internal routes of Yunnan, from the source of the Sichuan River, the Six Zhao, names and categories, the Six Dangers, the Yunnan City, the products within Yunnan's jurisdiction, the customs of the barbarians, the teachings for the southern barbarians, the names of the countries adjacent to the southern barbarian borders, totaling ten volumes. The book includes the ethnicities, history, geography, products, customs, systems of Yunnan in the medieval period, as well as the problems of neighboring barbarian countries, which is extremely complex. Each problem requires extensive research and study. The Man Shu should be discussed in a separate article. Here, only a brief introduction to the version content can be given. (Written in Beiping on the 26th day of the ninth month of the 36th year). (End of section)</p>
<h3>Three Letters on the Twelve Hours of Zhi Gong</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yiliang Hu Shi</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>To My Esteemed Friends,</p>
<p>Upon returning last night, I carefully translated Zhi Gong's "Twelve Hours Ode" and found it quite unbelievable. I have several doubts, which I dare to express to you, hoping for your correction.</p>
<p>First, regarding the Luoyang Monastery (as recorded in Volume II, Chongzhen Temple section: "King Yama said: Those who request scriptures harbor selfishness and arrogance, bullying others. They are like deer among monks. Now, we only test them by sitting in meditation and chanting scriptures, not by lecturing on them"). It also says, "The essence of a monk lies in focusing the mind and guarding the spirit, with the will set on chanting." It seems that during the Six Dynasties, there was a branch of Buddhism that did not focus on lectures but emphasized chanting. However, the sutras mentioned here still belong to the Hinayana Chan meditation of An Shigao's time, which is quite different from the Chan sect since the Tang Dynasty, which does not rely on writing but transmits mind to mind. The "Twelve Hours Ode," "Great Vehicle Praise," and "Fourteen Categories of Praise," attributed to Zhi Gong in the Transmission of the Lamp, do not differ greatly in content and represent the Chan Buddhist thought of the period after Huineng. In the "Twelve Hours Ode," the lines "Only guard the mystery, without words," as well as the criticism of "searching for lines and counting characters" in the "Great Vehicle Praise" and the discussion of the non-duality of truth and falsehood in the "Fourteen Categories of Praise," although seemingly consistent with the Chongzhen Temple section of the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang, are actually different matters. In essence, I suspect that the ideas in these three pieces could not have existed in the Six Dynasties or, at least, could not have been expressed in such a developed manner. Yuan Nianchang's "Chronicle of Buddhas and Patriarchs Through the Ages," Volume 9, states that Baozhi "composed ten chapters of 'Great Vehicle Praise' and fourteen chapters of 'Category Praise,' along with the 'Twelve Hours Song,' all of which clearly express profound meanings, their essence being in accord with the Chan school, and they are widely circulated in the world today." This likely recognizes that their time of origin is impossible, hence the phrase "in accord."</p>
<p>Second, the writing style of these three pieces is consistent, suggesting they are not very early. My intuition tells me that they are not works of the Six Dynasties, though it is difficult to "bring evidence" to prove this. Words like "Patriarch" and "A Shu" seem to have only appeared after the Six Dynasties. Unfortunately, I have not yet thoroughly examined the books.</p>
<p>Third, the "Biographies of Eminent Monks" by Huijiao, Volume 10, the biography of Baozhi, is in the section on "Divine Abilities," and the records of his actions are all mythical tales. Those who wrote about Zhi Gong did not mention these three pieces, only stating, "Sometimes he composed poems, his words like righteousness records." Furthermore, in other texts, such as Daoxuan's "Further Biographies of Eminent Monks," Volume 5, the biography of Fayun; Xiao Zixian's preface to the imperial lecture on the Prajna Sutra (Collected Works on the Propagation and Clarification of Buddhism, Volume 19); Emperor Wu of Liang's "Ode to Pure Karma" (ibid., Volume 29); the "History of Liang," Volume 37, the biography of He Jingrong; the "History of Chen," Volume 26, the biography of Xu Ling; the "History of the Southern Dynasties," Volume 7, the basic annals of the Liang Dynasty; and the "Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang," Volume 4, the White Horse Temple section, etc., the records of Zhi's actual deeds are all related to divine abilities or prophecies. It is difficult to recognize this kind of divine monk, whose specialty was divine transformations and illusions, as the author of the works collected in the Transmission of the Lamp.</p>
<p>Fourth, the reason why Chan monks of later generations attributed these three pieces to Zhi Gong was probably strategic. In Huijiao's "Biographies of Eminent Monks," Volume 3, the biography of Tanmoliye She, it is said that "Although he was clear on the Three Baskets, he specialized in meditation. Every time he went for a stroll, he might not get up for seven days... The monk Zhi studied his meditation books." Could this section be the origin of the connection between Zhi Gong and later Chan Buddhism? Huijiao's biography of Baozhi also states, "Someone asked about the meaning of the twelve, and he replied: The meaning lies in the hours and moments recorded in the book. Those who know understand that the book resides within the twelve hours." Could the "Twelve Hours Ode" have been written based on this hint?</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that the "Twelve Hours Ode" was likely written by later generations and falsely attributed to Zhi Gong. However, I am not sure whether the twelve-hour format for rhyming prose was already in use during the Liang Dynasty. Therefore, although the ode may be fake, its format need not be fake. However, the "Book of Sui," Volume 15, the "Records of Music," states that Emperor Yang of Sui "ordered the music official Bai Mingda to create new sounds, creating the 'Ten Thousand Years Music'... and the 'Twelve Hours' tunes... The Emperor... said to his favored ministers: Those who play many tunes are like those who read many books. Reading many books enables one to write books, and playing many tunes enables one to create tunes. This is a natural principle." The twelve-hour tunes of the music and this "Twelve Hours Ode" must be related. I strongly suspect that this format actually originated in the Sui Dynasty. I have written this haphazardly, hoping that you will not hesitate to give me guidance. I wish you well! Your younger brother, Yiliang, bows respectfully.</p>
<p>November 6th, Qinghua Park</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Brother Chongmin,</p>
<p>I have read your letter to Mr. Yiliang and his discussion of the Twelve Hours.</p>
<p>Baozhi's "Twelve Hours Song," like other poems, is very good vernacular, and the reasoning is very clear. If it were really a text before the Tang Dynasty, the two volumes of the Collected Works on the Propagation and Clarification of Buddhism would not have failed to include it. The fact that these songs are not included in the two Collected Works on the Propagation and Clarification of Buddhism allows us to deduce that they are late works.</p>
<p>The "Yi Hour Song" of the Twelve Hours says, "The Patriarch said," the "Hai Hour Song" says, "Surpassing Sakyamuni, exceeding the era," and the "Zi Hour Song" says, "The Patriarch said, external affairs." These are idioms from after the mid-Tang Dynasty. The forger did not know history, so he left this handle. (Omission)</p>
<p>Shizhi, 36th year, 11th month, 21st night</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>My Esteemed Brother Yousan,</p>
<p>Regarding Baozhi's "Twelve Hours Ode," I have another thought that I did not mention in my previous letter, so I am supplementing it here.</p>
<p>During the Six Dynasties, the convention was that when abbreviating monks' double names, only the last character was used, such as Dao An being called An He Shang and Hui Yuan being called Yuan Gong. There are many such examples, but there were no cases of using the first character. When transliterating barbarian names into Chinese, the last character was also taken, such as Yuwen Heilai or Hei Xun (people in the Sui and Tang Dynasties often took "Hei Xun" as their name, which was probably this character) being shortened to Yuwen Tai; Gao Huan's barbarian name Heluhun being shortened to "Hun" and then changed to "Huan"; and Heba Yun's barbarian name Aju Ni being shortened to Heba Ni. This was the common practice at the time. In the "Biography of Fayun" quoted in my previous letter, it is abbreviated as "Zhi," and in the "Ode to Pure Karma," it is called "Zhi Gong." Only in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang is it called "Bao Gong." Therefore, whether this Bao Gong is Baozhi (or Baozhi) is a big question.</p>
<p>The Twelve Zodiac Songs in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang may be the earliest example. Perhaps Bai Mingda adopted this format for the lyrics and composed a tune for them? Chan monks in the Tang Dynasty probably mixed the Twelve Zodiac Songs of Zhi Gong in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang with the text of Tanmoliye She's biography in Huijiao's "Biography of Baozhi" and created the story that Baozhi wrote the "Twelve Hours Ode" and then wrote this ode to make it a reality.

<p>Your younger brother, Yiliang, respectfully presents. January 18th, 37th year</p>
<h3>Postscript to the Facsimile Edition of the Tang Code Commentary, Third Series of the Four Treasures Serial Publication</h3>
<p>— Wang Chongmin</p>
<p>According to the original name of this book, "Code Commentary," Changsun Wuji and others presented a memorial saying, "Compiled the Code Commentary in thirty volumes." The commentary also states, "Compiled the Code Commentary with Li Ji and nineteen others and presented it in a memorial." Volume 1, "Nomenclature," contains a commentary explaining the meaning of the word "commentary," saying that it takes the example of the commentaries on the classics, wanting to combine exegesis and commentary to clarify it. The explanation of the naming is particularly clear. Both the Sui History "Record of Sutras and Writings" and citations by people in the Song Dynasty also refer to it as "Code Commentary." The handwritten book unearthed in Dunhuang is also titled "Code Commentary," all of which are clear evidence. I wrote a postscript for the Dunhuang manuscript, where I also suspected this, but said that "Code Commentary" has the same meaning, connecting "commentary" to "discussions," which began with the people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, which was still not definitive. At that time, I only saw the Dainan Pavilion's reproduction of the Yuan edition. Now I see the Song edition collected by Ni Huiqi, facsimiled in the Third Series of the Four Treasures Serial Publication. After the text of the code, the commentary is indented one space, although both are crowned with the two characters "Commentary and Discussions." In the Yuan edition, both characters are in intaglio, while in the Song edition, only the character "Commentary" is in intaglio, while the character "Discussions" continues to the sentence below. This one-character difference between intaglio and relief can enlighten my thinking and help me understand a lot. The articles are the code, and those who explain the articles are the commentary. The code and commentary are like the classics and their commentaries. What Changsun Wuji and the nineteen others discussed were all explanations of the articles, all "commentaries." In the Song edition, the character "Commentary" in intaglio is followed closely by "Discussion," which is exactly the matter. Because Changsun and others took the ancient codes as discussions, they uniformly crowned the discussed text with the two characters "Discussions." Since "Discussions" and below are the words of the commentary, they are placed below the character "Commentary" in intaglio, which is very clear and easy to distinguish. The Dunhuang edition does not have the character "Commentary," only "Discussions," because what is discussed in "Discussions" is placed in the position of "Commentary," which can be seen to be a commentary. The Song edition has the character "Commentary" in intaglio, and the Dunhuang edition does not have the character "Commentary" in intaglio, but their meanings are the same, without any errors. The Yuan edition puts "Commentary and Discussions" in intaglio together, which loses the original meaning. However, for hundreds of years, no one has noticed the mistake.</p>
<p>The postscript to the Tang Code Commentary in the Guisi Drafts, Volume 12, says, "The book is named 'Commentary' because it clarifies the code and its points; it is named 'Discussions' because it clarifies the deep meaning of the code and what the code does not cover or reach, like Dong Zhongshu's 'Spring and Autumn Judgments' and Ying Shao's 'Resolving Affairs,' and also like collections of refutations."

<h3>Democracy 101</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>I haven't been to the park in a while, partly because the weather is too cold and partly because there's nothing to see in the park at this time except people looking at people. But I heard that the park has abandoned the ticket collection method and switched to a system where visitors vote themselves in, so I was quite eager to see it. So, the other day, I took a detour to a certain park.</p>
<p>It happened to be a Sunday, and the weather was good, so there were quite a few people in the park. As far as I could see, except for certain people who entered through the exit, the rest of the visitors who entered orderly through the entrance almost all bought tickets and tore them up themselves, throwing them into the wire-mesh trash cans. There were very few people trying to get in for free.</p>
<p>I think this measure by the park management is worth praising. In most countries in Europe and America, parks are naturally open to the public because citizens pay taxes, and park expenses are already included in the municipal budget. Even in the inland areas of China, many parks do not require tickets.</p>
<p>The reason why Shanghai's parks require tickets, I guess, probably originated from the original "No Chinese and dogs allowed" sign. Later, although "Chinese" were also allowed in, the municipal authorities, then under the control of foreigners, still felt that there should be some restrictions, so visitors to the park had to buy tickets. Although it was only a dime or two at the time, for the "lower-class Chinese" of that time, a dime or two was a considerable sum. In fact, the park visitors at that time were mostly well-dressed people who didn't care about a dime or two.</p>
<p>The reason for restricting "Chinese" was probably because civic education was not yet widespread at that time. For example, some people arbitrarily broke branches and flowers, trampled on the grass, etc., which were undeniable facts. Even now, these kinds of uncivilized behaviors still exist. However, the method of dealing with this kind of behavior is not as effective as using mandatory restrictions as it is to adopt an inductive approach.</p>
<p>The current change of the park's ticket system to an automatic method can be seen as a prelude to the complete free opening of the park. In fact, spending one or two thousand yuan to visit the park once is something even beggars can do now. But the significance of this matter is not the issue of a few dollars for tickets, but an experiment in civic education.</p>
<p>Speaking of automatic systems, the United States should be said to be the most advanced country. The automatic ticket-buying system on public streetcars has long been widely implemented. Now, many economic cafeterias and department stores have also adopted automatic payment systems. When you go to a food store to buy something, no one will monitor you. You only need to pay the value of the goods according to the price tag on the item. For things like chewing gum that cost five cents a pack or cigarettes that cost a dime a pack, there are even automatic payment and delivery machines. Even shoe shines have automatic machines. You only need to insert a dime (equivalent to 20 cents in U.S. currency) like you would to make a public phone call, and put your shoes on the footrest, and they will be shined in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, the purpose of this kind of automatic system in the United States is not to guide civic morality, but to achieve commercial goals. It is said that the automatic purchase and payment system can increase the sales of goods. But such a system can only be implemented in countries where civic morality is relatively high, which is probably an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Things are a bit different here. Although the four words of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame are prominently displayed at the top of the International Hotel, some people still think it is an honor to enjoy special privileges. The habit of riding in white cars and watching free shows is something that everyone has long been accustomed to. I think this may have nothing to do with integrity and shame, but rather with the conditions of economic life. However, people who have no economic problems (such as buying an electric ticket) often think that being able to get away with it is a matter of face because of their "uniqueness."</p>
<p>The greatest significance of the automatic system is to enlighten people's concepts of rights and obligations, and being able to understand the relationship between rights and obligations is the starting point for implementing democracy. The greatest obstacle to the implementation of democracy in China is that there are still too many people in society who like to enjoy special privileges. I hope that in the future, people who go to the park not only go to breathe some fresh air, but also to practice the first lesson of democracy.</p>
<h3>The Smallness of the World</h3>
<p>— Xinmeng</p>
<p>The posthumous portrait of the late US President Roosevelt, in addition to the United States, is used by ten other countries on forty types of stamps.</p>
<p>The entire world's cod liver oil is manufactured and supplied by Norway, reaching 1.5 million gallons each year.</p>
<p>The human body is made up of 206 bones, and 696 muscles make it move.</p>
<p>Texas is the largest state in the United States, but its area is smaller than that of French Indochina.</p>
<h3>Nails</h3>
<p>— Meibai</p>
<p>Today, there are as many as 1,200 different sizes of nails manufactured in the world. The smallest is only 3/16 of an inch long and weighs 1/6000 of an ounce, while the largest is 15 inches long (used for shipbuilding) and weighs 26 ounces (16 ounces per pound). The difference in weight between the smallest and largest nail is 156,060 times.</p>
<h3>People Think of "Hi"!</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, when the receiving officials came to Shanghai to handle the receiving work, things did not go smoothly. Mr. Zhang Henshui was the first to shout a slogan, calling "People think of English and Chinese." This slogan, of course, does not need to be explained, but hidden behind this sentence is what a painful lesson it contains! Knowing that what is past cannot be remedied, and knowing that what is to come can be pursued, is precisely the guiding principle that we should urgently and directly seek, and it is also the demeanor that a country advocating democracy should possess. In German military camps, there are also people who think of Hitler.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the United Kingdom and the United States indicated that they would establish a republic in western Germany, which would issue its own currency, manage its finances, manage domestic and foreign trade, and lead elections. In short, from all aspects, it is an independent and autonomous government. The question is whether Germany, which has been subjected to Nazi education for twelve years, can kick it aside and accept a democratic life. That is a question.</p>
<p>A French magazine called Esprit collected a large number of letters, which were not originally intended to be published, so they could speak freely. The letter writers ranged from university professors to laborers, and most of them were not very concerned about the American method, but expressed a longing for Hitler's national socialism. Therefore, the New York-published Magazine Digest added a reprint, they did not find this kind of argument objectionable, taking what is useful. The attitude of democratic countries is particularly worth emulating. The editors of Magazine Digest also added a note: "Judging from these letters, if the new Germany is not a re-edition of the Nazis, then American re-education and democratization should be restarted and accelerated."</p>
<p>One letter admitted that the National Socialist Party had bad elements, and their actions were opposed by Hitler, but he praised the party's discipline, training, and decisive style. It is said that Hitler lacked the talent of a diplomat and was forced into war. The Germans did not want to fight, and Hitler did not want to fight.</p>

<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven Full of Doubts (82)</p>
<p>As Zhu Zhai thought about it this way, his mind became more peaceful. He was busy going to work early in the morning. When it was time to get off work, he came to Qi Wan's house. Qi Wan had already left. According to Aunt Wang, "Early this morning, Director Miao called, urging the boss to go there. The boss delayed until 3:00 PM, when Director Miao sent a car to pick her up, and then she left. Before the boss left, Director Miao called several times, and later, I don't know what they said, but the boss got very angry and hung up the phone, ignoring him. Judging from the boss's expression, she doesn't seem to be very close to this Mr. Miao." Hearing this, Zhu Zhai couldn't help but say, "Amitabha, I hope so." Aunt Wang laughed and said, "Mr. Xu is also chanting Buddha now." Zhu Zhai said, "I am very worried that the boss knows this Mr. Miao, because this kind of military man is very difficult to deal with. If the result is that she gets burned, it won't be worth it!" Aunt Wang said, "Well, Mr. Xu, you can advise her. Besides, everyone knows about the future of you two, the word has spread!" Zhu Zhai smiled and said, "What are they saying outside?" Aunt Wang said, "Who doesn't know that the boss is going to marry you!" Zhu Zhai said, "I only hope that there won't be any changes along the way!" Aunt Wang said, "What changes could there be?" Zhu Zhai hesitated for a moment and suddenly asked, "Mr. Xu, does your family know about you and the boss getting married?" Zhu Zhai asked in surprise, "What do you mean by that?" Aunt Wang really wanted to tell Zhu Zhai that Yu Ru had come to find Qi Wan the day before, but she thought that there might be other reasons, and Qi Wan didn't allow her to say it, so she held back. After a slight hesitation, she smiled and said, "It's nothing, I thought that in such a major matter as marriage, your family's old master must have known about it long ago." Zhu Zhai had no choice but to agree, "Of course they knew long ago!" Aunt Wang said, "Have you been in contact with that Miss Zhang these past few days? The boss often says that Miss Tong is a college student, and she is not as good as her." Zhu Zhai said, "I haven't been with her for a long time." Aunt Wang said, "Then there's nothing wrong. I'm just being too sensitive." Saying this, she smiled again, took a step back, and let Zhu Zhai out. After hearing these words from Aunt Wang, Zhu Zhai's heart was suddenly filled with doubts. After thinking about it carefully, his family definitely didn't know about getting married to Qi Wan, and even Yun Qing and Feng Sheng would never have thought of it.</p>
<h3>How Not to Get Drunk</h3>
<p>— Yuwentu</p>
<p>How can you drink without getting drunk? After several experiments, I have come to the following conclusions: (1) Drink alone—the amount and duration are up to you, and you are not forced or restrained by the crowd when drinking together, so you can stop at a moderate point and you won't get into a messy state that abuses yourself and others. (2) Avoid thinking—it fills the intestines with sorrow, and on the surface it is excitement, but in reality, the inside and outside are uncoordinated, the contradictions are sharpened, and the pain is deepened. The wise do not take this approach, so when savoring the flavor in the cup, be sure not to change your mind or use your brain. (3) Avoid beauty—the "beauty" mentioned here refers to women who are very likely to destroy the drinker's "drinking style." Once she is by your side, not to mention mediocre people, even wise men often ignore the value of the wine and unknowingly waste a lot of precious nectar.</p>
<p>If you want to drink without getting drunk and always stay clear-headed, the above is a proven formula that you may want to try.</p>
<p>Another person wrote from Berlin, believing that Germany's only mistake was not shedding enough blood during the revolution. The Soviet Union cleared out all its enemies during the revolution, and France had the guillotine. But in Hitler's time, everything went very smoothly. Unemployment disappeared, there was no low pay, and the whole country restored order. At the end, he admitted that Hitler's actions were wrong in certain aspects.</p>
<p>A German anti-Nazi, who had lived in a concentration camp for six years, wrote that after the victory, famous Nazis were not only not in jail, but were in important positions. Germans are openly discussing the next war, and as soon as the Allies leave Germany, the old Nazi spirit will be revived immediately. Germany will one day be back in a combat position. His conclusion is that the spots on a leopard will never change.</p>
<p>Some people questioned whether other countries had any wrongdoings, whether they had concentration camps. He believes that Germany is just a vast penal camp, but those who sow seeds of hatred cannot reap the fruit of love. Some people believe that the conquerors will take away the Germans' opportunities. The Germans' production is not for themselves; they are working hard for others. One worker said, "Hitler wants us to be good Nazis, the Americans want us to be good democrats, maybe tomorrow the Soviets will want us to be good communists. What about after the Soviets... God knows!"</p>
<p>The above can be seen as "people's grievances." If the British and French authorities are willing to listen to the people's grievances and correct them if they have them, and encourage them if they don't, then the great way to rule the world lies in this!</p>
<h3>On Eating</h3>
<p>— Daoxian</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered who invented eating shellfish? How did we start eating jellyfish skin? Perhaps no one can answer these questions now.</p>
<p>Human eating habits vary with time and region. At one time, our ancestors ate nothing but animals with fur. To this day, many local delicacies sound horrifying to outsiders.</p>
<p>People in Oregon in the United States like to eat rattlesnakes, saying they taste like a mixture of pork and chicken. And the French believe that nothing is more delicious than snails. You've certainly heard that people in some places love to eat rats. (Editor's note: There are many rats in Yunnan. During the war, when Mr. Pan Guangdan taught at Southwest Associated University, he was initially troubled by the many rats. Later, he adopted the principle of "diligently catching" them, and gained quite a bit of spoils, so he "braised" several of them to treat his students. The students initially did not know what they were eating, and praised it as Mrs. Pan's specialty chicken chicks.)</p>
<p>There are many things that ancient people ate that modern people think cannot be eaten. For example, Romans ate caterpillars, believing they were similar to almonds. Epicures in Caesar's time liked to eat ants fried in white sugar and butter. They also liked to eat spiders, parrot tongues, and ostrich meat.</p>
<p>Europeans first ate potatoes (foreign yams) at the end of the sixteenth century. The first person to eat them was an Englishman named Thomas Harriot, who wanted to use potatoes to commit suicide. That was in 1584. Harriot returned from exploring the Americas and thought of a girl he was deeply in love with, but could not get rid of. So, he cooked a potato grown by an Indian, because it was said to be very poisonous and could kill you. As a result, he didn't die. The claim that potatoes are poisonous was also broken.</p>
<p>Tomatoes, which people today call rich in vitamins A, B, and C, were once thought to be very poisonous. In 1834, an old grandmother tried various methods to cure her sick and thin grandson, so she handed him a tomato. According to legend, this was the beginning of humans eating tomatoes.</p>
<p>According to legend, the first to discover the consumption of coffee was an Abyssinian donkey during the time of Charlemagne the Great. The owner of this donkey discovered that whenever it passed the foot of a mountain, no matter how much he kicked or whipped it, the donkey would not take another step unless it was allowed to eat its fill of a shrub growing at the foot of the mountain. And after it had eaten its fill, it would be full of energy, but he would have to kick it and whip it to make it stop. Finally, the donkey owner discovered that the shrubs at the foot of the mountain bore fruit. He chewed it and found it delicious and stimulating. Later, people in the Western Hemisphere had long been boiling coffee to drink, and explorers still found Abyssinians chewing coffee berries.</p>
<h3>The Green City and Dragon Mountain of the Northwest (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Junzuo</p>
<p>Crossing the Yunlong Bridge, one ascends Dragon Mountain. There is only one wide road leading up this high mountain, and the slope and curves are gentler than those of栖 Yun Mountain. After crossing Yunlong Bridge, one finds Dragon King Temple. To the north of the temple is a small hut, also enshrining the statue of Wu Yuanzi, adorned with powder and carved like a Western doll, quite different from the warrior statue on栖 Yun Mountain. There is also a statue of Confucius, with a powdered face and turban, resembling the incarnation of Zhuge Liang. Looking at the clay sculptures on both the east and west mountains, none have artistic value. However, the mountains themselves are worthy of being famous mountains of the Northwest. If there were just one Tang dynasty sculpture with upright horns, it would greatly enhance the beauty of both mountains. Going south from the Dragon King Temple, there is a small divine cave. Further up is the Jade Liquid Spring, where water emerges from the stone crevices, accumulating into a well of unparalleled clarity. The spring is located in the corridor of the Guandi Temple. To the left is the Stone Bodhisattva Hall, and to the right is the Guandi Hall. Ascending the slope eastward, there is the Lingguan Hall with three rooms, and further up is the Bodhisattva Hall. On the brick wall behind the hall, there is an embedded Chinese translation of Genghis Khan's last will, stating: "If a vast territory and numerous people wish to resist foreign enemies, they must unite their hearts as one." This famous saying will forever be a principle for a nation to strive for survival. To the upper right of the Bodhisattva Hall is the Taibai Palace, also known as the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan. The Mausoleum of Genghis Khan was temporarily housed in the Taibai Palace on Xinglong Mountain in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) upon the recommendation of Prince Sha and with the approval of the Central Government, having been moved from the Ejin Horoo banner of the Ih Ju League in Suiyuan. The Taibai Palace, also named the Great Buddha Hall, has neat buildings, but they are not spacious and are gradually deteriorating. The loneliness of a wasteland for a hero of the ages evokes endless sorrow when mourning. Visiting the mausoleum, one is guided by a Mongolian official. Upon entering the hall, one first bows in respect. The hall is draped with yellow cloth, and the sides are filled with wreaths, elegiac couplets, and plaques. In the center hangs a portrait of Genghis Khan, whose image is robust and resolute, inspiring awe. In front is Genghis Khan's silver coffin, 120 cm long, 77 cm wide, and 99.5 cm thick. The coffin is inlaid with gold-carved patterns and studded with pearls and gems, covered with multiple pieces of colored silk – one more piece is added during the grand sacrifice on the 18th day of the third lunar month each year. In front of the silver coffin is a framed photograph taken from a stone stele. To the left of Genghis Khan's silver coffin is the silver coffin of his concubine, Fujin, 100 cm long, 60 cm wide, and 70 cm thick. Its form and decoration are the same as the coffin of Genghis Khan. In the silver coffin of Genghis Khan, he is buried with his empress, both cremated. Burial treasures and his personal clothing during his lifetime are placed in this silver coffin. His empress and concubines have no portraits, presumably because they were virtuous and beautiful. In front of the shrine of Concubine Cheng, there is a small lacquered wooden box with a red sandalwood carved square mirror on top, 42 cm long and 32 cm wide. The mirror surface is smooth and thick, and the image is clear. It was brought back from Huanshou by Genghis Khan during his western expeditions and given to her for her dressing. Heroic figures and beauties shine through the ages. To the right of the hall is a steel spear, shimmering with silver light. The spear is 20 cm long, and the shaft is 2.50 meters long, covered in yellow silk and topped with black hair. It was the weapon used by Genghis Khan himself in his conquests, and it is accompanied by a legend – once, Genghis Khan was surrounded and prayed to Heaven, when suddenly a spear descended from the sky, which is the one mentioned above. However, this spear slowly descended without touching the ground. After the sincere pleas of this generation's hero, it finally fell into his hands at the critical moment of victory or defeat, unleashing unparalleled divine power and dominating Eurasia. The thick circle of black hair on the spearhead is said to be human hair. When Genghis Khan fought, he would pull out a hair from each person he killed and tie it to the spear. The number of hairs represents the number of people killed. Nowadays, it would take at least five or six people to lift this steel spear. The steel spear stands behind a square table, on which rests a square wooden box containing a sword, 80 cm long and 20 cm long. This was Genghis Khan's personal sword. In addition, there is a bow hanging on the wall, its size disproportionate to the spear and sword, possibly an accessory. Exiting the side door of the Taibai Palace and ascending the slope, one reaches the Yaowang Temple, and further up is the Three Holy Mothers Hall, inhabited by the Mongolian tomb keepers. Following the path further up, there is the Three Teachings Cave, with several buildings built to the left and right of the cave. The Three Teachings Cave was originally located below the Three Holy Mothers Temple, but it was moved to its current location. There is a legend: the old site of the Three Teachings Cave was remote and simple, and over the years, it had become dilapidated, with no one to burn incense. In the third month of the ninth year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing dynasty, a dove-shaped bird suddenly came to the mountain, flying back and forth and chirping mournfully. Its sound seemed to be calling out to the Three Teachings Cave. It lasted for three years and never flew away. The old Taoists and rural farmers did not know what kind of bird it was. Later, a Taoist priest named Jin Jiaoli, while meditating, suddenly realized that this bird must be the Qing bird envoy of the Three Teachings Kings, calling out to the Three Teachings Cave to ask people to rebuild it. Thereupon, this Taoist priest made a great vow and went out to raise funds, rebuilding the Three Teachings Cave at its current site. After the construction was completed, the bird disappeared silently, its whereabouts unknown. According to my thoughts: when I lived on Yucheng Mountain, there was a strange bird called the "Wooden Fish Brother," which cried mournfully at night until dawn, disturbing people's dreams. Perhaps Xinglong Mountain has this kind of bird, and the Taoist priest used this to raise funds and build the temple, with good intentions. Ascending south from the Three Teachings Cave, one soon reaches Taibai Spring, originally named Sanyuan Spring. It was renamed its current name during the Xianfeng reign of the Qing dynasty. The spring is located below the Taibai Tower. The "Taibai" is not the Taibai of Li Taibai, but the Taibai of Venus. The spring emerges from the stone crevices, one on the left and one on the right, and is guided into the water tank by stone troughs. Wooden boards are laid on the tank, and three small holes are opened at the front end of the tank, dividing the water into three round holes in front of the tank. In front of the holes is a half-moon-shaped pool to hold the spring water flowing from the holes. Below the stone steps in front of the hall, there is a round stone trough, with a stone dragon head in front of the trough, spitting water from the dragon's mouth into the trough. From this stone trough, a small hole leads the water into the deep abyss in front of the hall. This spring is clear as a mirror, with a sweet and delicious taste. The bottom of the water is covered with many small stones. It is said that anyone who wants to have a child only needs to go upstairs, kowtow to Venus and plead, then go downstairs and reach deeply into the hole for a small stone, and give it to his wife, and she will have many precious children. The loveliness of Taibai Spring is not purely because it has clear and delicious spring water, but also because it offers a distant view of the beautiful scenery of Saddle Mountain and a close view of the enchanting scenery of栖 Yun Mountain. On both sides of the main hall of the spring, there are three wing rooms each, with clean tables and bright windows, making them the best places to view the mountain scenery. However, the Taoists of Taibai Spring are truly pitifully poor. In the kitchen, there is nothing but coarse flour and salt. Although the mountain tea has a unique flavor, it is quite bitter. Therefore, those who visit Taibai Spring must bring their own food, which can be cooked in the kitchen here. The entire scenery of Xinglong,栖 Yun, and Saddle Mountains is projected onto Taibai Spring. Visitors can linger here, enjoy tea and wine, sing songs and compose poems, anything is appropriate. The four mountains have many white clouds, and the white clouds are endless. Taibai Spring is the best place to view the clouds. To visit Xinglong Mountain, one must go to Taibai Spring. Speaking of famous sites, there is only the small stone stele inscribed with "Taibai Spring" by President Yu Youren.</p>
<p>In short, the greatest feature of Xinglong and栖 Yun Mountains is their lush forests, with ancient cedars and pines that take several people to embrace, visible everywhere. Between the two peaks is a clear stream with a rapid current, and a beautiful reclining bridge across the stream is especially rich in poetic and picturesque charm. This is not only a famous mountain of the Northwest, but it would also be worthy of any of China's famous mountains. And all of its forms are very similar to Green City Mountain, but the aesthetic pattern of the entire mountain structure is even better than that of Green City Mountain. Traveling from Lanzhou by car, a visit can be made leisurely in one day.</p>
