<h3>國大第十次會議　續檢討經濟政治　代表發言集中物價及抨擊富豪</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕國大第十次大會，十五日下午三時四十分舉行，出席一七四五人，主席團第六組輪値，由朱家驛主席，秘書處宣讀第九次大會紀錄後，開始本日議程，繼續讀檢討經濟及政治報吿，兩日來要求發言者極踴躍，十五日下午大會並延長至六時半始散，惟獲得發言機會者僅十九人，散會前，主席詢問各代表，未及發言者可否以書面意見送秘書處，彙轉有關部會以書面答覆，當無異議。</p>
<p>本日發言中心，大多集中於物價高漲及抨擊豪門資本諸點。</p>
<p>湖籍婦女代表徐憑玉，曾大聲呼籲淸算豪門資本，渠特別提出，救濟特捐之巨商客戶名單應趕快公布，要分配公平，並迅速辦理，俾免物價高漲以後，待此項捐款收到時，已不足購得麺包兩隻。同時，渠主張淸算豪門資本，官僚資本，因物價之上漲，實係彼等之領導，徐之發言，曾獲得全塲掌聲。其他仍有若干代表對此發言：</p>
<p>福建林紫貴稱：一般物價之飛漲，乃受國營，公營事業漲價之領導，故應即迅速命令各地，設法使物價能回至四月份以前之價格，使老百姓能維持最低限度之生活。</p>
<p>綏遠蘇珽稱：當前國家稅收，多由窮人負担，以致形成以窮人出錢，維持國家之支出，實為窮人保護富人之現象。渠同時提出，政府應對貧瘠省份予以補助。</p>
<p>陜西王孔安稱：我們經濟應係建立於三民主義之基礎之上，而非建築於資本主義之上，但目前現象，只見到財富集中，游資橫行，而未見實行節制資本，平均地權。在此國家生死存亡關頭，渠提出必須强制征收救濟特捐與富戶特捐，並認為外援自屬重要，但最要者仍是自力更生。</p>
<p>廣東高信指出：（一）外匯政策錯誤，官價·牌價迫使每年達二億美元之僑匯逃往香港。（二）出口結匯辦法失當，因官價之限制，商民裹足不前。（三）進口配額因受限制，幾使廣州若干工廠倒閉。（四）紗布禁止南運，係根據何法，應請經部答覆。</p>
<p>僑民代表黃景燦認為：僑胞對祖國出力甚大，而民國廿九年之美金儲蓄券僑民購買甚多，但延至今日，償還辦法未獲解決，致僑胞均怨聲載道。渠同時提出政府對護僑政策應予改善。</p>
<h3>立法院會議通過　短期國庫券條例　修正提審法及戒嚴法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立法院十五日晨九時半舉行第三五二次例會，孫院長科主席。首通過上次會議紀錄，繼由樓秘書長桐孫報吿國府對該院前議決嗣後修訂郵電價目，須經立院審議通過後方可執行一節之指令，認為戡亂緊要時期特許調整郵電資費與授權調整稅收同一情形，立院決議文尚無碍於國務會議所作是項臨時決議之執行。旋進行討論事項：（一）中華民國三十七年短期國庫券條例草案案，通過。（條文刋二版）（二）修正提審法草案案，修正通訊。（條文刋二版）（三）修正內政部禁烟委員會組織條例第五條第六條第七條條文草案案，通過。（四）中國銀行向美國進出口銀行借款購買棉花合約（三十五年三月十四日簽訂，信貸美金三千三百萬元）及其展期合約（同年九月十二日公函）案，追認通過。（五）中美售讓船舶合約曁美國航務委員會與中華民國政府售購戰時建造船舶合約（均三十六年七月十五日簽訂廉價購進舊船）案，追認通過。（六）關於核發國際難民委員會所主管難民之旅行證協定案，通過，並建議由外交部轉令各駐外領館於該協定施行後，入境簽證應愼重辦理。（七）戒嚴法修正草案案，修正通過。（條文刋二版）至監察院所提監察院監察委員行署組織條例草案案，以現在監院未便先代新監院擬定其內部級織，決議緩議。主計處級織法草案案，俟其名稱地位及所轄是否增設「設計局」，經政務會議研究有所決定後再行討論，決議，重付審查，與其有關之修正行政院組織法案案亦隨之緩議。修正預算法草案案及防空法修正草案案以時間不及，定期於下次會討論。十一時三十分散會。</p>
<p>潘公展代表上海各代表發言，提出四點意見：（一）上海為經濟中心，若干人指責上海奢侈豪華，游資充斥，請問此等游資自何處來，是否為上海自印鈔票，抑各地游資彙集於上海，負責當局應查究游資來源。（二）上海物價，卅五年較卅四年高六七倍，卅六年較卅五年高達廿倍，卅六年政府實行穩定物價政策，何以物價更高漲，政府應予解答。（三）上海物價高，工資高，原因固多，最大原因為外匯官價一再上漲，每逢物價略穩定，外匯必調整一次，其原因即是管理外匯之人即是掌握外匯之人，故滬市工商界要求之進出口聯鎖制度，中央始終不肯實行。（四）華中綏靖會議通過之土地處理辦法，係承認共黨選留之政策，則今後非綏區之人民亦均將效法，故吾人必須推行吾人之土地政策，不得跟踪共黨，而保留其劃分辦法，潘氏發言時，各代表時報以掌聲。</p>
<p>黑龍江農會代表馬毅發言，對東北接收表示不滿，對物資之去向不明表示痛惜。認為接收未得人心，反均失人心。</p>
<p>瀋陽張寶慈則認中蘇條約之訂定致造成東北今日之危機，政府應迅速提出解決之措施。</p>
<p>山西何德福提出，晋省目前糧荒嚴重，政府無救濟之策，而征購軍糧，且以低價收購，民衆負擔繁重。</p>
<p>雲南張珽戡提出，征糧辦法應改為改征法後，以减少弊端。</p>

<h3>松江安圖縣區城國代　孔憲榮在京自縊　義勇軍被解散竟出下策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕國大期間代表又弱一個，松江省安圖縣區域代表孔憲榮，十五日下午五時許因國難家毀之憂患，自縊於旅社，經蠶覺後業已身死，善後正由國大秘書處辦理，當晚移送中國殯儀館。孔今年六十八歲曾歷任東北抗日軍指揮，東北保安區司令，吉遠安邊區總指揮等職。前東北部隊改編，孔之指揮部撤銷，職務亦經免去。孔有一妻，二子，二媳。永士撤守時，其妻及一子一媳被匪所俘，餘一子一媳困居長春，另有一姪，現羈京模範監獄。孔於七日抵京後，見姪媳亦困苦不堪，同時痛感東北共匪猖獗日甚，自身復感英雄無用武之地，不若以自殺喚起國人警覺，以加强剿匪軍事之推進，竟出此下策。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕松江國代孔憲榮自縊身死，十五日晚主席團開會時，東北代表王星舟曾提出報吿，主席團對孔之自縊均表惋惜同情，當決譏由大會向國府建議請從優撫卹其遺族，並褒揚其抗日功績，十六日下午二時棺殮，晚國大代表並應前往致祭。孔之遺體已移中國殯儀館，莫德惠及東北代表定十六日上午八時前往致祭，莫熱淚盈眶語記者，孔之自縊，最主要原因係其義勇軍被當局解散，來京後雖屢次向當局交涉，亦無結果，今演成此一慘劇，我未能為渠帮忙，實在對他不起。杜聿明十五日晚亦語記者，孔在東北抗日剿匪，忠勇衛國，今自縊慘死，實感慨萬端，十四日余曾約其晚餐，渠談及義勇軍被解散時，即表示異常悲痛，不意一日之隔渠竟自縊，殊深痛惜。孔返東北時，係隨杜前往，杜曾委孔任第二支隊司令，在吉林附近担任游擊工作。</p>
<h3>法幣發行額確婁　六十九萬億元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕確息：法幣發行額截至本年三月底止，共六九六·八二一億元，本年賦稅收入一至三月共為一一八·六八四億元，佔總收入一九七·〇四三億元百分之六〇·二三，佔總支出五〇一·七〇九億元之百分之二三·大六。普通歲出係以普通歲入（即增加稅收）使之平衡者，此為本年上半年度國家預算之特點，截至現在為止，普通部份尙屬保持平衡，特別部份則因戡亂期間難免不有超越，惟美援已經通過，下半年情形當可望改善。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　從熱烈到疏放</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕國民大會開了十七天，今天（十四日）開始進入修憲的程序。由於若干代表檢討政治經濟報告尚未滿足，主席國決定今天的議程，分為上下兩批，上午九次大會討論憲法修正案（一讀），下午十次大會繼續政治經濟檢討。議程截然不同，代表們的情緒也截然不同，上午表現的是熱烈，下午却表現了疏放。</p>
<p>由於昨天散會時的不愉快，主席團提出今晨討論憲法修正時，担着兩個問題的心，一個是怕代表們不滿意，一個是怕出席代表不够憲法規定的四分之三的數額。九時卅八分開會時，這兩件事却都順利。今天到會人數特別多，僅次於蔣主席致詞那天，達二〇三二人，恰够法定三〇四五人的三分之二多一點。潘公展代表主席團的一篇報吿，使代表們不再反對議程。主席何成濬打着湖北官腔，宣佈討論憲法修正案。洪閘友報吿處理修憲案的程序，他一再道歉，為了印刷關係，提案直到開會後才送到會塲。這些都沒有發生什麼問題，倒是為了出席代表幾分之幾的總額問題，有人在樓上喊：「請主席解釋總數是法定的總數，還是選出的總數？」</p>
<p>洪蘭友的解釋，不能令發言者滿意。主席的回答遲了一點，有人又在呌：「主席為什麽不快點答覆？主席不能操縱會塲！」樓下有人噓，顯見這少數甚至一二人的意見並不被重視。主席說：依憲法規定，惟司法院有解釋憲法之權，總額問題，由大會函請司法院解釋。這時樓上下正散發憲法提案原文，樓上一陣喧嘩，嚇了主席一跳，原來為了發提案，有些人爭着搶，造成一些小小的漪漣。</p>
<p>憲法一讀程序算是開始了，合於規定的六項提案一一宣讀，由提案人分別說明要旨；張知本提案最先提出，他的修正條款獲得全塲空前熱烈長久的掌聲。似乎他的意見正是全塲的意見；莫德惠的制定臨時條款案，也得到全場的熱烈擁護。這兩案是修憲的精髓。劉維熾，高巍，溥儒，孫繩武的四個提案，則是偏於局部的修改，自然也無人反對。在一讀進程中，惟一突出的挿曲，便是靑年黨女代表鄭初卿力排衆議，反對在此戡亂期間修改憲法；但她遭到與劉宦相同的命運，會塲中一片叫囂的噓聲，使她無法說下去，雖然她在麥克風前高叫爭取發言權，也被喧擾聲淹沒了。這插曲也充分表現了代表們的熱烈情緒。上午開了兩小時半的會，沒有人「抽籤」，幾乎都集中了注意力來諦聽提案的內容與提案人的說明。</p>
<p>下午出席人數祗有一五四一人，較上午少了四分之一，其後陸續「抽籤」。休息後，估計不過千人。下午六時，主席朱家驊宣佈延長半小時，許多代表不顧一切走了。散會時，會塲上至多還有六七百人，幸而是檢討，沒有表決，否則人數又該出了問題。但是繼續政治經濟檢討是幾位代裘拍主席台爭出來的，却不想代表們有着如此疏放的情緒，有的根本不來，有的半途而去。下午的疏放與上午的熱烈，正好是有趣的對照。</p>
<p>一百四十人要求發言，時間上是不許可了。今天下午，發言的代表很普遍，包括東北·河北·山西·陜西·緩遠·福建·廣東·廣西·江蘇·江西·四川·雲南·上海·僑民和職業團體，他們幾乎一致抨擊外交·財政·經濟·糧食·施政的不當，主張激昂的獲得全塲掌聲，祗是因為會塲人數漸少，發言者和靜聽者都似提不起興緻，所以當主席宣告「未發言的代表請用書面提交其意見」時，沒有人再表示反對。六時半，朱家驊一聲散會，會場中一陣歡聲，這歡聲也許就是整個下午疏放情緒中的唯一熟烈的表現。（四月十五日於南京）</p>

<h3>社論　國際形勢與中國外交</h3>
<p>國民大會於十四日晨舉行第八次大會，由外交部長王世杰作外交報告，除了說明我國對於世界和平的態度而外，並報告中美　係的演進及蘇聯對於中國負有四項重大義務：（一）蘇聯軍　除在旅順者外，均須自我國東北撤退；（二）蘇聯不得以任何援助給予反抗國民政府的中共；（三）蘇聯不得千預我新疆內政；（四）蘇聯必須切實尊重外蒙的獨立自主。最後又聲明我國的對日政策，主張未來對日和的必須保障日本不能再事侵略，但在經濟方面並不反對日本人民的自給自足。從王外長的簡單報告中，也可以看出我國現行外交政策的梗槪，但是非常明顯的，缺少一種自發的進取的革命精紳，對於第二次大戰後的國際局勢的認　，也缺少遠見和先知。大家都知道外交輿國防是保衛國家生存的兩大武器，在國防不甚鞏固的國家，更加覺得外交的重要；尤其在今日國際形勢瞬息萬變的時候，格外需要外交的運用，以謀國家的安全與國策的實現。</p>
<p>我們做報的人，天天埋在新聞堆裏，整理，研究，標題，不僅洞悉我國國內局勢，而且也接觸到國際政治，因此願乘國大檢討中國外交政策之際，提出幾點意見，以供國大代表及外交當局的參考。</p>
<p>第一，我們要指出第二次大戰後的國際問題經過兩年來的演變，已經完全變質了。翻開近代歷史，凡在國際戰爭結束之後，接着必定召開和會，以收拾戰後的殘局，故戰後所成為國際問題的，必為如何處理職敗國。一八一四年的維也納會議，一九一九年的巴黎和會，都是一個絕好的說明。同樣，在第二次大戰結束之後，所謂國際問題，在歐洲言，，是對德問題；在亞洲言，是對日問題。但是兩年以來，列　不論對於　國問題或對於日本問題，都沒有商得共同一致的政策，不僅對　和會對日和會迄未召開，而且列强的意見，尤其是美蘇兩國的意見，背道而馳，愈趨愈遠，使目前的國際問題竟成了美蘇問題。在這種情形之下，徒然便宜了戰敗團。以　國而論，美國已積極在那裏扶持德國，作為美國在歐洲的反蘇堡壘，此在蘇聯也想利用德人的反美心理，煽動　人展開反美運動。美蘇在柏林鬥爭，就是　有這種目的，回首瞧瞧日本，因為美國的朝野充滿了一片扶助日本很興的呼聲，戰敗者也已破涕為笑了。所可憐的，只有我們中國，勝而不利，日本的復興就是我國安全的威脅，王外長說我國的對日政策，在軍事上要使日本不能再事侵路，但在經濟上並不反對日人自給自足·從表面看來，運個對日政策是公平合理的，但是在事實上仍有問題。在現代化的國際戰爭中，軍事與經濟是不可劃分，日本經濟的復興，就是日本侵略勢力的恢復，是誰也不能否認的，此其一·又武裝日本作為美國在遠東的反蘇前哨，不僅在美國輿論界有人作此主張，而且日本也以此討好美國。我國在軍事上主張嚴厲，務使和約能保障日本不能再事侵路，又怎樣才能貫澈？一味跟了美國走，必將鑄成歷史上的錯誤。日人誤會我國對日輿論已接近美國，不管是對我國對日政策的一大　　，</p>
<p>第二，我們主張外交方針，不能一成不變，而應運用自如，以適應國際環境。例如在抗戰期間，我國一面與美國駢肩作戰，一面與蘇聯保持友好的關係，並接受蘇聯的援助。迨至抗戰勝利後，我國一面接受美國的援助，一面又與蘇聯訂立友好　盟條的，均足以表示我國不僅願與美蘇和平相處，通力合作，確保遠東太平洋的和平；而且也顧做美蘇兩國和平合作的橋　，促成美蘇間的諒解，共同締造世界和平。以當時的國際環境採取這種外交方針，可以說是量　明也沒有了。因為戰後我國國家和人民的迫切要求，莫過於建設復興，自然需要國際間的和平，也需要美國的經濟援助與技衛合作；又因中蘇兩國邊界毗運長達數千公星，蘇聯的友誼，自然也是我國所需要的，故不惜任何代價與其訂立友好問盟條約。可是兩年以來，因為內亂的繼續與擴大，影響到我國的國際地位，使我們的外交方針未能收到預期的效果。一方面我們迫切需要美國的經濟援助，造成美國對於我國的錯誤觀念，認為我國一味依賴外援，不知自力更生，因此美國與綸界常有批評我國的君論，使美國經濟援華也受到相電的限制。此在另一方面，我國雖不惜任何代價追求蘇聯的友該，但所得的結果，中蘇友好同盟條約，成了我國片面履行的友好條約，蘇聯所負的重大義務，均未能見諸事實，王外長前天在國大會議大聲疾呼，要求蘇聯切實履行義務，足見我國償付了一筆重大的代價，並未能換得蘇聯的友誼。由此說來，我們實在不能不承認外交當局的自卑心理造成我國外交的失敗了。</p>
<p>第三我們認爲世界兩極化日益明朗，在美蘇矛盾之中，親美天親蘇都不是我國的出路，反而容易招致不測之禍，老　　，我們祗有一個不可顚破的原則，這就是對外獨立自主，　　自力更生。唯有雙管齊下，始能保持遠東的均勢，我們果能自强不息，成爲遠東唯一的安定力，即使不費什麼代價，也能取得蘇聯的友誼；我們果能自力更生，力能負起對於遠東和平所應盡的責任，則美國唯恐中國不接受她的援助，那裏還會發生什麼問題！</p>

<h3>西歐聯盟實施問題　五國外長將在巴黎討論</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十四日電〕外傳英法荷比盧外長將乘在巴黎參加十六國會議之便，以組織五國西歐聯盟公約下咨詢委員會之說，未能由官方加以證實。英發言人並不否認五國有交換意見之可能，惟討論之時間及地點則尙未決定。聞法國贊成咨詢委員會設在巴黎，荷比盧贊成設在白魯塞爾，然以西歐聯盟並牽涉防務問題，因此亦有人主張設咨詢委員會於倫敦。法國認為該咨詢會之經濟職權旣與歐洲復興方案之十六國永久機構有密切關連，自以設在巴黎為宜。</p>
<h3>杜魯門請國會　撥付援歐經費</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十四日電〕社　門總統今日以正式法案提交衆院，請撥四十二億四千五百萬美元，為歐洲復興計劃經費。按該計劃之經費雖已由議會兩院通過，但依照美國成例，總統應特殊提出此一法案。</p>

<h3>「工廠衛隊」待機而動　奧共黨醞釀政變　蘇緊縮對維也納包圍圈</h3>
<p>〔路透社維也納十五日電〕此間西方盟國人士深懼蘇聯之限制西方國家軍事人員之通行，係為進備奧共黨之發動政變。彼等指出蘇聯已縮緊對維也納之包圍圈，以阻撓西方盟國軍事人員之移動蘇當局業已通知某一西方盟國，於派軍隊赴維也納時，須先通知蘇軍總司令部，此外並悉蘇軍總司令柯拉索夫將於十六日在盟國委會中要求議決限制佔領國軍事人員之於緊急時期應召協助奧國警察。</p>
<p>一般電關切者為蘇聯區內共黨工人所組之所謂「工廠衛隊」，其實力約二千人，為充份武裝而流動性極大之部隊，堪為共黨發動政變時之堅强工具，蘇當局最近頒佈之限制盟國軍事人員移動辦法，大部份為針對英軍人員，蓋英佔區距離維也納電近。蘇當局之主要限制交通辦法，係針對公路交通。於發生緊急狀態時，公路固為西方盟軍可以開往維也納之唯一捷徑。西方盟國諒不致同意蘇聯要求之停止以盟軍協助奧警察之點此一要求表面上似為使奧國免受盟國之干涉，其實則為便利共黨武裝的「工廠衛隊」在盟國莫能為助的情形下，長驅直入維也納而已。</p>
<h3>德境蘇軍佔領區　將實施幣制改革</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十五日電〕據悉德境蘇聯軍政府已獲莫斯科命令，准其進行擬具東德幣制改革之詳細計劃。蘇軍政府已指令蘇聯區之德國經濟財政當局進行此項工作。接近蘇軍政府及德行政當局之人士謂，東德之幣制改革於五月底或六月初即可實施。</p>
<h3>傳蘇坦克百輛　集柏林南郊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十五日電〕英官方十四日報告：蘇坦克車約百輛，已於十四日晚間開入柏林南郊，據稱，該批坦克車開入之森林地區約離柏林美佔區三哩左右。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十五日電〕聞蘇聯當局業已注意英方所傳消息，訊蘇軍及坦克車隊業已在柏林附近甚至在柏林城內集中。蘇聯各界稱，此項消息純係出於挑撥，並稱將對此項消息予以答覆</p>
<h3>英下院通過　廢止死刑　以五年爲試驗期</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十四日電〕英下院十四日放棄黨派觀念并不顧政府之反對，以二四五票對二二二票通過，在五年試騐期內，廢止判殺人犯以死刑。該法案如果成為法律，則在英帝國之內，僅有國事犯（叛逆），有暴行之海盜行為，及破壞皇家造船廠者得判處死刑。在此五年試騐期內，英殺人犯可被判無期徒刑，而不致被判絞刑。當該案出人意料被通過時，下院內一片歡聲，議員興奮殊甚，雀躍歡呼，握手慶賀，投擲紙張，其狂喜之情在莊重之下院內，實為罕見。</p>
<h3>義大利普選展望　政府黨對勝利具有把握</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十四日電〕此間右派各報今日載稱，義其黨已因蘇聯拒絕美英法三國泱議開會討論特港交還養大利問題而大感惶恐。同時美外交觀察家認為蘇聯此舉，足見其已放棄養共在十八日全國普選獲勝之希望。加斯員利總理今日自北部演說歸來後，發表談話，表示基督敎民主黨對於普選頗有把握。但共黨行動猛烈，一如往昔。米蘭民衆六千人今日在工人領導下游行示威，張貼標語，抨擊總理。加氏與共黨領袖托格里亞第現定明夜在那不勒斯分別發表最後一次競選演說，然後全國人民將有廿四小時之考慮機會，以便參加十八日之投票，決定擁護或反對共黨。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十四日電〕東西兩强雖同時對義大利施用壓力，然就最近的分析顯示，於十八日舉行投票時，當不致發生嚴重的動亂，而於選舉結果公布以後，料亦不致發生大規模的暴動革命或政變。據義大利最主要的民意測騐機構陶薩學院院長費吉士敎授稱，義選民約二千九百萬人，惟至多僅百分之八十五參加投票，其餘百分之十五當因疾病·路遙·無知·不感興趣而棄權。然渠預料若干政黨當不惜採用不正當的方法，以產生較多的選票，故就所投選票之數宇觀總數或當達全國選民總數百分之九十。敎授繼謂渠料基督民主黨至少可獲百分之四十之選票，而共黨集團如屬幸運，所獲至多不致超過百分之三十之選票。費氏相信義北左　份子今日已不如一九四六年之親共，亞平寗山以北除米蘭外，以及波格那。莫台那·及巴爾馬等地共黨勢力頗有損失，然在羅馬及義南部則共黨雖居少數地位，然勢力已較前為雄厚。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬十五日電〕佛洛倫斯各報告誡投選舉票之女子，投票時勿塗口丹，因選票稍染紅色，將作廢票論。</p>
<h3>南韓美佔領區　擬自行發電</h3>
<p>抵制蘇方停電威脅</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美官員十四日談稱：蘇聯軍政府頃以截斷南韓美佔領區內內之電力供應，咸脅美方，此加施壓力之戰術與在柏林及維也納對美方交通綫所施者不相上下。美方爲抵制此項威脅及自己奮發計，已派出電力供應船多艘，此等供應船可處置南韓佔領區內之緊急電力供應事宜。</p>
<h3>德境美佔區下令　驅逐匈代表出境</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗朗克福十五日電〕美軍政府長官克莢頃命令德境美軍區內之匈遣僑團團員四人，匈牙利索還財產使命團員十一人，於四十八小時內退出美軍區。克萊為此事致匈之備忘錄，指出匈當局於一九四六年一月廿一日曾拒絕美官員隨美方遣僑列車進入匈境，而匈當局又未能阻止匈境內之蘇官兵對該列車實施搶刦及其他無紀律之行為。克萊並曰，除非匈方能予滿意答覆，美當局將續採其他行動。</p>
<h3>蘇女記者彼得芝　函新聞自由會議</h3>
<p>抗議蘇聯新聞政策</p>
<p>〔央社日內瓦十四日合衆電〕據悉：日內瓦國際新聞自由會議秘　處曾接獲上海前蘇聯女記者彼得芝之來函。彼女士於函內抗議蘇聯在世界各地之新聞政策，惟秘書處不擬就此採取行動。據稱：大會僅得處理由官方代表團及請詢機構所提出之問題，彼得芝最近始辭去蘇每日新聞職務。渠復曾抨擊蘇聯塔斯社及蘇記者公會上海支會之事橫政策（按渠巳被該會革除）。</p>
<h3>越南各黨均反對　保大爲法國傀儡</h3>
<p>法越和議已瀕破裂</p>
<p>〔聯合社香港十五日電〕接近法方人士今日聲稱：法國與安南遜王保大所進行之越南和議已瀕破裂，其故在於法方態度仍倔强，越盟亦堅特在政治經濟及軍事上完全獨立。各黨領袖均不希望保大復辟，徒作法國傀儡。</p>
<h3>日敦城收藏家　發現我國古泉幣</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十五日電〕日本本州日本海岸敦賀城之收藏家，發現一千九百餘年以前之中國古「貨果」。據東京民報稱，日本考古家相信，此為目前在世第五枚泉幣，按泉幣係由王莽所鑄，目前極為珍貴，日前京都帝國大學敎授梅原，於大阪收藏家處發現，一般相信為第四枚之泉幣，日人對之頗為注重。敦賀城收藏家高橋閱讀雜志上梅原之報告後，發現渠家藏數世之收藏品中，亦有泉幣一枚。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約十四日電〕安理會五國會議今夜宣布：巴勒斯坦停戰條件已擬就，內容大致如下：（一）所有軍事行動，暴動，恐怖行為及罷工，罷市等破壞行為，一律停止，（二）一切武裝隊伍或能使用武器之個人禁入巴勒斯坦；（三）各種武器及軍用品不得運入；（四）停止各種政治活動，以待聯大特會本星期五開會重行討論分治案。</p>
<h3>英外部宣稱　捷軍火援猶</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕外交部發言人稱：英政府早知大量武器，在警察監督下，在捷克裝入飛機，秘密運往巴勒斯坦，供給猶太人。</p>
<h3>美煙煤礦工潮　餘波猶未解決</h3>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕全國礦工聯合會長魯易斯今日在聯邦法庭受審，對於被控藐視法庭三日命令之一即通告全國烟煤礦工停止罷工一節，拒絕答辯。依照該項罪名，可能判處罰鍰或徒刑，明日即可宣判同時，此次工潮雖於十二日因養老金問題成立協議而告解決，但四十萬礦工中約半數仍未復工，靜待法庭對於路氏宣判結果。</p>

<h3>美蘇陸軍力比較　勃雷特萊支持普遍軍訓</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕參謀總長勃雷特萊今日在衆院軍委會稱，美國倘不實施普遍軍訓，必須擴充常備軍。蘇聯現役軍隊有一百七十師，吾人所接諜報，瞪明其在六十日內可以增至三百師以上，蘇聯各附庸國復可調兵九十五師。美國目前兵力約為九師，無一師員額充足·第二次大戰結束時，美國有陸軍九十師，其中八十九師駐在國外。吾人倘不實施普遍軍訓，最佳的安全辦法，唯有擴充常備軍，使能支特戰爭一年，以待動員之生效。換言之，美國需要基本軍隊一百廿五師，約一百五十萬人。</p>
<h3>機關槍陣密佈下　汛美會議昨復會　哥京仍混亂馬卿寓邸府附近有衝突</h3>
<p>〔路透社波哥大十五日電〕廿一國汎美會議於上週末起因哥倫比亞之叛亂而趨於停頓後，已於今日在波哥大總統府內復會，府外爲鐵絲綢所包圍，並密佈武裝衛隊友及機關蘠　陣.議程上之歐洲國家在西半球的殖民地問題，尙議而未決，大部份代表均料復會後至多十天即將閉幕。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕福民輪船公司萬里輪，在北嵊山觸礁沉沒，旅客船員登陸，誤入匪區，各情迭誌報端。昨據該公司消息，公司徇旅客家屬之要求，今晨向中央航空公司包一專機，載旅客家屬代表九人，並由公司派職員五人，陪同飛靑烏，以便就近探聽旅客下落。另一部人員，亦於今晨乘機赴津，與靑島方面聯絡。又據該公司長城輪來電稱，前晚至萬里輪失事處，當夜黑暗，無法察看，乃奉公司命等至天明，見萬里輪擱於大陸山脚。大約該輪觸礁船底洞穿，船長恐船身沉下，即足馬力向山脚猛衝，使擱入淺灘，而免沉沒，故該輪船身雖有破裂開，但船身水平綫上均露出水面。船員旅客決已全部離船登陸。另一方面消息，萬里輪自津駛滬，乘客四百餘人中，有外籍旅客十三名，其中俄僑有九人。聞本市某俄國機關，昨接該批俄人來電報告，中外乘客及船員均甚安全，惟確實下落不明。</p>

<h3>解雇案件突增　社局將召集各工廠　勸導保障善良工人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據社會局統計，近半月來，工廠解雇工人斜紛案件，突然增多。社局副局長趙班斧昨日對記者談稱：此種現象發生於上月本市治安當局拘捕大批潛伏於工界匪黨份子之後，若干工廠之資方，趁機解雇平日感情不洽之工友，因此事件後一般工人未免惶恐，負賣工會工作者尤多銷聲匿跡，不敢爭執。資方認為此乃大好機會，遂加利用。然政府所拘捕者均為參加共匪工作而有確可證據者，對善良安份工人，仍一本初衷，保障其職業安全。故社會局即將召集本市各工廠資方來局談話，向資方勸導，俾不再有類似情形。</p>

<h3>嚴培興有裝瘋說　原因是財產作祟　「瘋謎」案極堪注意的一個解答</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕嚴培興「瘋之謎」一案，發展到現在，法院方面雖然尙待本月二十七日票傳韓芬黃英邦兩位醫師來辯論嚴培興究竟有無精神病，但社會上一般人對於嚴之瘋與不瘋，差不多已有很肯定的認識，所感到不解的關鍵是：如果嚴培興不瘋，何以他要寫出那些怪誕的字條來？如果確是瘋子，他的妻子為什麼存心把那些怪字條興怪照此保存起來？關於這一個謎，他們夫婦倆雖各有解釋，但顯然都很牽强，而最近各界則盛傳着一個頗堪注意的解答，那就是嚴培興最初是與其妻合作而裝瘋，結果則弄假成眞，幾造成殺身之禍。</p>
<p>記者為證實這一種說法，特地訪問嚴袁及與他們接近的親戚，他們雖然都否認其事，但站在第三者立塲的他們的親戚，則認為嚴培興確有裝瘋其事，由此而演化成一幕「螳螂捕蟬，黃雀其後」，而黃雀後面更有瘋人的悲劇。</p>
<p>根據他們所談，嚴培興裝瘋的原因有兩種。第一是為了併有他的紡織五金廠中其他股東的股份，其中包括他兩個姪兒的股份。第二是在敵偽時期業廠中的出品有售給同業而被同業轉售給敵偽的，嚴恐怕被人告他是經濟漢奸，故而裝瘋規避。</p>
<p>華興五金廠來歷</p>
<p>嚴的華興紡織五金廠，在廿六年創辦的時候，並不呌華興。那時候河南路的總發行所是「新業紡織用品製造廠」，大西路的分廠是「申大紗管廠」，前者的股東除嚴的哥哥嚴培德外，另有別人。創辦時資本總額一萬八千元，後者資本一萬五千元，其中三分之一是嚴培德所有。民國廿九年，嚴培德至宜興丁山祖壇祭掃，歸途被日軍殺害於太湖中，於是廠務就由嚴培興獨攬。迨至抗戰勝利時，廠中營業極為發達，在上海紡織五金界已有相當地位。此時嚴培興一方面為避免勝利後可能遭遇的麻煩，一方面被廠中為數可觀的財產所惑，夫婦倆一商量，他就裝瘋住到無錫，故意寫些怪誕的字條，拍些怪誕的照片，嚴袁寳英告訴人家說嚴培興瘋了，廠中攪得一塌糊塗，虧蝕得一塌糊塗了。對他兩個姪子以及其他股東說：你們還是把股份拆了，自已去經營吧。結果這兩爿廠居然拆夥。據他的兩個經子說：他們所分得的財產，不到他們應有股份的一半。從此以後，新藥廠與申大廠就合併為華興紡織五金廠，他的兩個姪兒則另到周家橋開設了一家規模較小的仁豐鋼絲棕廠。</p>
<p>這一般過程，據說是嚴培興夫婦合作對付嚴的姪兒嚴心吾與嚴心台兩人。袁寳英說是嚴的姪兒要謀取叔父的財產，嚴心吾與嚴心台則說是他們的股份被吞沒。</p>
<p>十年不生子　夫婦不和睦</p>
<p>廠中的股份旣然歸於一統，嚴培興的禍可就起於蕭牆之內。嚴與袁結被十餘年未生兒子，這是造成他們不和的根本原因。在敵偽時期，嚴培興曾兩次娶妾，都是由袁寳英找來，不久又不容於袁而被趕出。第一次娶的是袁娘家嫂嫂的妹子，結果以有狐臭為藉口而拆散。繼而又娶一同鄉女子叫桂秀的，結果說是有花柳病。據說三個人曾經一同到天潼路的三醫民院與法租界的樹德醫院去騐過，最後那可憐的桂秀還是被趕出了嚴家大門。這樣他們倆始終沒有兒子，袁寳英就把希望寄託在自己的內姪袁祥徵身上。袁祥徵家鄉本來據說祗有六畝田，現在居然自己也開了一間「泰來」紡織五金廠。袁寳英想以十五歲的女兒招祥徵為贅婿，嚴培興則堅決的反對，因為第一兩人年齡相差八歲，第二統太相近。這一種意見的衝突，使他們夫婦間的裂痕一天天擴大，而嚴培興的有神經病已經出了名，這樣，最後就發生了嚴培興進普慈療養院的一幕。</p>
<p>醫院見族人　和淚訴前情</p>
<p>嚴培興進醫院後，他的兩側姪兒與其他族人聞悉後，曾經去探望過一次。他們本來對於嚴培興的瘋病將信將疑，在醫院中嚴培興流着淚說以前對不起他們，又說自已實在沒有神經病，請他們設法來救他，後來由他的胞妹向警備司令部告密，才把人提了出來。</p>
<p>嚴培興現在對他的妻子深惡痛絕，對於過去的事則總是說不要再談了，如果他眞是一位扮演喜劇的「聰明人」結果則成了悲劇裏的角色。他心裏面有說不出的痛苦，也就可想而知了</p>
<p>總而言之，這是一齣牽涉到嚴重社會問題的家庭悲劇。以一個市民的立塲來看：第一，嚴培興進普慈療養院時有沒有武裝者挾持？第二，如果嚴培興確實不瘋，將他收容禁閉起來的醫院當局應該負些什麼責任？第三，嚴培興的財產究竟有沒有被幕後人物來侵佔？這幾個重要的疑實，都有待當局的加緊澈查，來澄淸這肚會上的黑暗！</p>

<h3>客胃呆滯人心虛怯　紗市昨仍疲輭　染廠拋售棉布一致下游</h3>
<p>昨棉紗市况，實銷呆鈍，本街實銷亦懈，因此各級均以低盤開做，過程起伏亦趨狹窄，四二支藍鳳雖中途高喊二億三千五百五十萬，二一支雙馬自一億四千一百萬開做，奈以人心虛怯，欲升乏力，加之浮空乘機活躍，市價步步下沉。前者終以二億三千二百萬收市，再跌一百萬，後者曾見一億三千七百萬低盤，迨至臨收，浮空略有抵補，稍見回上，結果以一億三千九百萬結束，續跌四百萬。四〇支及三二支各檔均回跌一百萬至六百萬之間，二〇支以下各檔續挫一百萬至三百萬不等。</p>
<p>晨開各布，一致疲憊。民營染廠因坏布疊降，紡建公司供售充裕，故染廠均以期貨先拋，客帮納胃仍缺。十二磅龍頭細布自四七四萬開盤，逐步下挫至四七一萬元，少有買戶。各檔細布，跌六萬至七萬元。一二〇士林布降五萬至十萬元，餘均趨入疲檔徘徊。</p>

<h3>食米回升</h3>
<p>米市稍見回升，因連日下跌，市勢萎麼已久，昨因錫價轉昂，同時本街米店添補轉暢，又以連日到貨甚少，貨主售意亦减，市勢乃見開朗，晨開即見提高五萬元，南市塲白粳三百七十萬，同白元等各漲五萬元，早薄稻則挺十萬元，後市更覺堅昻。北市塲白粳三百八十萬，其他早薄稻，秈米等一致升五萬元。昨日到貨南北二市共三千四百八十二石。</p>

<p>食油　回漲，因疲乏已久，油廠鮮有開出，到貨亦减，昨因米價回挺，人心為之一振，本街乘低檔相繼補取，銷化乃活。廠豆油回籠貸初做八百〇五萬，轉瞬在濃郁之買氣下，直挺至八百二十萬。豆餅汕帮重來納取，挺二萬元。</p>

<h3>赴日貿易代表曾紀殷　談對日貿易前途</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國赴日私人貿易代表，前因簽證記帳辦法未定，業務難於開展，特推代表曾紀股返國請求。曾氏返國旬餘，曾數度赴京接洽，現悉對日貿易簽證記帳辦法業由政院核准備案，並正通令各有關機關查照。曾氏昨接見記者稱：此項辦法之公文抵達東京我國代表團後，代表團即可以此為原則，向盟總經濟局進行洽商再商定實際貿易辦法。由於我國外匯頭寸之短少，及信用不甚堅强，進行貿易時必須先行出口，獲得外匯，再以之購買日貨進口。目前我國可輸日之貨物，為桐油猪鬃牲皮生漆等，但商人可控制者，恐為數不多。由於中日兩國今日均缺乏外匯，故短期內之商業展望，並不良好。同時，日本有若干製品，他人歡迎而非中國所需要，例如去年聖誕節一美商購去兒童玩具十萬件，運至美國，銷路甚佳，但我國無此需求。供需不一致，亦為中日貿易困難之一端。關於日本一般之經濟情况，曾氏謂：日本輕工業之恢復速度可驚；且其工商界組織嚴密，行動一致，國內節衣縮食而以質作之產品全力外銷。今年進出口不但可平衡，且將形成出超。日本今日正以缺乏原料為苦，一部份中國可供給；但即使中國不供給，其他國家亦將供給。例如牲皮，戰前本由我門進口，最近則已向加拿大訂購三百萬噸，澳洲訂購五百萬噸以上。中日貿易是否有利於我國民經濟，全視本身之運用而定。</p>

<p>我們首先感到不但未可厚非，而且不可麼滅的是梁啓超在淸末所編的「新民叢報」和「淸議報」，雖然他所主張的政治改革和社會改革是局限於變法維新而不主張推翻滿淸政府，雖然他主張的是一套「虛君共和制」，但畢竟是大量介紹了世界上的新思想，新制度，而給中國政治上，社會上一種有力的啓蒙，淸算了死抱着中學為體西學為用論的張之洞式的錯誤，我們仍應不惜給予頗高的估價。特別是梁氏本人的熟情的，汪洋恣肆的筆鋒，開闢了中國文語彙的大門，而他的文章又那麼淵博與廣大，雖然深度密度今天看來不够；但在當時確是一種大胆風氣的開始；使人今天還想那種恢宏的休休有容的氣概。</p>
<p>後來在橫濱出版的另一定期刊「民報」，在中國政治思想上，比新民業報更進一步，它淸算了後者對於滿淸王朝的幻想，提出民族革命的口號，是以嶄新的革命姿態向變法維新論者桃戰的。編輯是新近逝世不久的張繼氏。他本人雖然不善屬文，但當時革命黨有才氣，有胸襟而能縱橫筆陣的卻不乏和梁啓超抗衡的人；由於理直氣壯，更使人感到一種活力，一種霸氣撲人眉宇。至今回憶，使人有隔世之感。</p>
<p>民國三年出版的甲寅雜誌，是章士釗打學洪憲皇朝有力的武器，在當時是完成了革命的歷史使命的。軍士釗當時的文章，不但邏輯嚴整，而且生氣勃然，潑刺而又井井有條，不像梁啓超的奔放，也不像有些人如戴天仇，吳稚陣的「跑野馬」，確實融合了古文，論理學，政論。更不必說還有章炳麟先生的古樸，字字有來歷而又峻刻的文章，足以制敵死命了。（後來甲寅於民十三復刊即成為恭頌段祺瑞總政的刊物，而且詆毀國父，當然是自毀歷史，不但不足觀，而且使人惡心了。）</p>
<p>在這以前的「東方雜誌」，在這以後的「太平洋」「少年中」國也有其歷史價値。前兩者有若干嚴議的學術論文。即使今天看來也未必完全失去時效，雖然世界學術三四十年來有長足進步。後者的對民族自尊心的喚起，不屈服於列强的崛强，真是一片朝氣。雖然今天有當時個把執筆者已蛻變而為政客，數典忘祖地率興放棄了早已變質的主張。</p>
<p>在民國八年五四前後成為靑年新聖經賢傳的「新靑年」，不但盡了中國新文化的啓蒙使命，而且也奠定了新思想的基礎，那麼多的從舊社會來的戰士，反戈一擊，也確實打中了舊社會的要害，怱怱三十年，死的死了，變的變了，「嫁」的嫁了，使人有白雲蒼狗之感。可是一個定期刊而發生這樣偉大的力量與影響。恐怕不但在中國過去空前，即使是將來也不易再有</p>
<p>民國十三年出版的語絲多少是承繼了新靑年傳統的，這小小定期刊，原是北大諸敎授偶然發動好玩的刊物，不想卻在中國文化史上也有它頗重要的一筆，那是由於它的態度是積極的，向屠殺革命的國民黨靑年與媚外的安福系政府不屈撓的戰鬥，即使是後來主張冲淡的知堂老人，當時也是以鬥士姿能尙封建勢力和帝國主義者進擊的。而特別値得提出的一點是：今天已經成長為一種有力的普一遍的短評雜感，便是當時以「閒話集成」「我們的閒話」為專欄，輯集許多作者的文章來發表的</p>
<p>本篇限於篇幅，只能略談綜合的定期刊，代表時代精神的純文學定期刊茲不涉及，話又就從這里打住吧。</p>
<h3>論鑰匙孔裏的新聞</h3>
<p>— 林野</p>
<p>鑰匙孔裏的新聞，有各式各樣不同的名稱，舉幾個比較常見的：如「內幕新聞」，「幕後新聞」或「新聞背後的新聞」等等，歸根結蒂只有一個意義：凡是躲在遮蔽部後的都是。</p>
<p>從這類新聞的身價（Value），在今天看來是「橫掃千軍」「蓋世無匹」的，最低限度它已成為報人競爭的對象之一。顯而易見的，市面上贏得大批讀者的刊物，無不在這方面成功了。譬如在重慶出版一直維持到今天的「新聞天地」，他們便擁有四萬讀者；而最近仿他而來的南京「中國新聞」，讀者也在逐漸地增多中；就是以政論見稱的「觀察週刊」也不敢忽略這類新聞。在歐美方而來看亦復如此：一九三二年「巴的摩太陽報」駐華盛頓通訊記者庇亞生（Drew　Pearson）和一基督敎箴言報」駐華盛頓記者亞勒（Robert　S．Allew）合出一本名呌「華盛頓遊藝塲」的書，對當時的時政作非正式的幕後述評，因此哄動了全美國，結果一躍而成著名的專欄記者。</p>
<p>何以這類新聞的身價如此高貴呢？尋其根源大別有如下的幾種：</p>
<p>其一，鑰匙孔裏的新聞最不容易獲得，摸不到門路，尋不着鑰匙孔或沒有鑰匙，根本就無法打開房門。有時雖然找到一鱗半爪也是出於偶然，或由於自己的推敲引證和判斷才有。這種來處不易的新聞當然比較普通的珍貴些了。</p>
<p>其二，每個人總有一些不可公表的東西，事情亦復如此有許多地方需要保守秘密，然而越是不能公表的東西越是嚴守秘密的事情，大家對它越感興趣，因此能够滿足了這種興趣就能够得到廣大的讀者，換言之，想得到廣大的讀者就要從這方面去和人競爭，鑰匙孔裏的新聞也就珍貴重要起來。</p>
<p>然而往往發生了如此的情形：有許多用不着隱蔽的「秘密」，一旦隱蔽起來便變成珍貴的新聞。換言之，一些本來沒有什麼價値的新聞經過了「隱蔽」這個階段後，就一躍而成記者們狩獵的目的物。這種現象是因為過分估計了這類新聞才會產生的。</p>
<p>其三，隱蔽起來的事實往往是很重要的，它可能轟動了全社會全人類，一治一亂關係甚大，因此而見重要。</p>
<p>最後一個也是最重要的一個：它最富於Interest的意味，所謂Interest就是能够提供出新的事實，造成新的形勢新的問題。看慣聽膩的舊新聞（事實）是不能引起Interest的；它帶有珍奇的，不平凡的，大家不知道的，不能預料的事實。</p>
<p>鑰匙孔裏的新聞是最重要的新聞已無可非義，但在報道上卻不能脫去新聞道德觀念的約束，處處都要牢記住一句話：「我為大家的需要而工作」，不能違背良心揑造事實，更不能用低劣的手法寫出一些導人以邪的新聞。</p>
<p>方塊刊物，黃色報紙亦即是所謂「海派」作風的新聞，在上海最為盛行。抓住了讀者的心理，專門找些街頭巷尾的流言，或揑造一些事實，譬如刊載大人物的秘史，放出一些能够聳動蠱或讀者的消息；毫無事實的根據，祗求銷路好牟利大就滿足了。這是新聞界的悲哀，也是報業的障礙。</p>

<h3>雇傭難</h3>
<p>— 聃笋</p>
<p>美國佛基尼亞州諾福克地方有一位主婦，最近感到非常愉快，因為最傷腦筋的「雇傭」問題已經解決了。她已經雇到一位女傭人，每星期來二次，帮助她做淸潔工作。</p>
<p>一天早晨九時半，女傭人來了。這時候這位主婦正在煮早餐，她以為女傭人一定是喜歡吃了早餐然後工作的，於是她就做了一客特別豐盛的早餐，有煎蛋，鹹豬肉和烘好的可口餅乾</p>
<p>「你吃過早餐後，」主婦說，「在洗擦櫉房之前，先將這幾隻盆子洗滌淸爽。</p>
<p>「太太，」女傭宣佈說，「我是不做任何洗擦工作的。</p>
<p>主婦聽了有點吃驚，但是再一想，還是不要爭辯的好。於是她就提議說：「好吧，先洗了盆子，然後再去淸潔浴室。」</p>
<p>「太太，我已經對你說過了，我是不做任何淸潔工作的。」女傭立刻回答。</p>
<p>「你的意思是，」主婦說，「跑到這兒來，坐下吃了一頓豐盛的早餐；不做一點工作，然後我再給你工錢，是嗎？」</p>
<p>「嗯，太太，」女傭回答，「那眞是一頓可口的早餐，我猜如果在店裏吃，一定要化費七角五分錢呢。」</p>
<p>於是女傭人從錢袋中取出七角五分錢，放在桌子上，再加了一角大洋的小賬揚長而去。</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十四章　逍遙海上　一一七</p>
<p>上面寫道：「毓如老先生賜鑒：綺紈自聆敎誨，要澈底實踐諾言，曾用種種方法，斷絕渚齋觀念，不牽得很環境不允許我，弄得身敗名裂，我想自我離開北平，必有許多人，背地議論我，笑罵我，我也無法辯白，此中委曲，也只有老先生知道最淸楚，也許能替我不平，現在我巳無面目，重同北平，再見同業了！不過我也不因此灰心，從前種種，譬如昨日死，現在我要重新做人，我已運從母親的話，重上舞台，一半為生活所迫，一半也為要借此消磨無聊的歲月，把精神都寄託在藝術上，或者能把以前所受創復忘卻，所幸上海各方面，對我很援助的，梅先生巳經正式收我為弟子，承他指導和提携，最近在上海露演，很博觀衆歡迎，我知道這都是浮名，不敢自滿，並且這些浮名，也不能解我心靈上的苦痛，老先生您古道照人，你能體諒，小兒女脆弱的心苗，是經不起一再催殘的，我每日在外面，隨波逐流，逢塲作戲，每到夜闌人靜，百感交集，淚濕衾枕，這種苦衷，不敢告訴別人，只有在老先生前，訴說一二，想老先生必加憐憫，渚齋近狀何似，我給他許多惡印象，也足够他刺激了，我希望他恨我，至死恨我，我心靈才覺安慰。</p>
<p>他若是知道我的一切作用，知我有意刺激他，眞相一明白，貽留給他的苦痛更大了，這其間應如何永久隱瞞他，專在老先生主持，我爽直告訴老先生，我對他的情感，一生是忘不了，我只希望他對我能忘得乾乾凈凈，减少我的罪孽，我並希望他，努力向上，以慰老先生晚景，我也得免書人的罪名，我對渚肅永遠不會通信的，我雖然想念他到極點，也不會寫一個字告訴他，引起他的苦惱，現在我為消除我心中煩悶，終日陶醉在浪漫生活裏，外人不知道的，以為我如何事受，如何得意，那知道我內心上，結下了一個不能磨滅的癥結，時日愈深，愈見苦痛呢？這些話原不該對老先生訴說，但是舍老先生之外，我對任何人也不能將我的苦衷告訴他，請老先生原諒，並祝你厚福！綺紈謹上。」渚齊看完這一封信，一個人痴痴站在桃樹下，兩眼望着桃花，一語不發，食柏在他肩膀上拍一拍道「渚齋你也應該努力了，才不負她一番苦心，她信上所說的話，完全要促使你上進的，你要明白她的用意。」渚齋給肖柏一拍，才回過神來，問道：「姑丈，她給姑丈的信，能給我看一看嗎？」</p>
<h3>談陸徵祥（下）</h3>
<p>— 清雪學園</p>
<p>更觀其與日置益每次談判的詳細記錄，（見王芸生著「六十年之中國與日本」，二十一條交涉段）反覆十數萬言，勾心鬥角，舌敝唇焦，輕重先後之序，隨機應付，其細心與才力，豈是庸碌人所能。（外次曹氏雖亦陪席，只能偶參一二語，且以彼方之陪席參贊小幡為對象）旣是一手經辦此約，則謂之「奸」之班頭，亦屬可能。照正常的理論，陸之功罪，似乎是一極大之矛盾。而一察歷史的演，則陸負責之前後兩大事，實乃相反而相成。不如此不能引導對於强隣之電後革命，而使之傾覆。（此中關係，說來話長，此處不能詐叙；但識時之士，不難略加思索，即知革命外交之「推動力一如正負兩電之互相為用。</p>
<p>「功」也罷，「罪」也罷，「忠」也罷，「奸」也罷。陸老先生是一切都沒有了。但旣非離去人間，又非長齋禮佛，而是去比國聖本篤修道院苦修力行。自一九二七（民國十六年）至今（一九四八）整整二十個週年；杳無消息。第二次世界大戰，希魔蹂躪全歐，比利時又首當其衝，炮火連天，生靈塗炭，陸老先生的生死存亡，何堪設想。然而奇妙得很，在大戰結束後一年（一九四六·民國三十五年）之秋八月，見到歐洲電訊，此老已經敎皇特獎修行成果，而任為剛城聖伯多羅祿隱修院的大院長。七月十日在比就職，各國的司鐸齊集致敬。他不但無恙，而且功行圓滿異常，這不但是中國貴所的夢想不到，即全世界聞人中亦是少見的奇蹟</p>
<p>人家道院的修行，是眞修眞苦，戒律森嚴，知行合一。第一年試習，第二年授聖名行「洗足禮」；第四年授為神父，行發願禮，共三條，大願（一）「紳貧」（Paunxete）（二）「貞潔」（Chastete）（三）「聽命」（Oberssonce）。陸氏一一奉行，十餘年如一日，院內各國修士，全然平等互助，無國界，無種界，無階級，無畛域，眞是世界人羣的模範。陸老以大名大位大富大貴的人，隱迹潛修，由壯到老，始終一致。按釋迦如來的聖蹟記，是位國王的太子看破紅塵，拋棄富貴，修成正果，自是超凡出衆的偉人。而事屬古代，僅見於記載，若陸老先生則現代現存實人實事，眞乃難能可貴之至。</p>
<p>陸氏是富於感情的人，對於他的愛妻（比國籍）之去世，傷心已極，亦是他出家之一因。但他對於恩師（許文肅景澄），對於知友，終身念道，如此德誼，並世能有幾人！</p>

Mr. Pan explained three points: (1) In response to the request of the majority of representatives to continue the review of political and economic issues, it was decided to hold a session at 3 PM today. However, as there are many requests to speak, representatives are requested to submit their opinions in writing as much as possible.

<p>Reading the Original Text of the Constitutional Amendment Proposals C. The meeting today will discuss six cases that comply with the provisions of Article 174 of the Constitution. Subsequently, representatives inquired about the interpretation of "total number," asking whether the total number was 3,045 or the total number of those elected. The chairman replied that according to the Constitution, the term "total number" refers to the total number stipulated in the Constitution, but the power of interpretation lies with the Judicial Yuan, and the Secretariat of the Assembly may submit a document to the Judicial Yuan requesting an interpretation. The first reading then proceeded, with the reading of six amendment proposals: (1) Zhang Zhiben and 689 others proposed amending Articles 20 and 29 of the Constitution.

<h3>10th National Assembly Meeting Continues to Review Economic and Political Issues; Representatives' Speeches Focus on Prices and Criticize the Wealthy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 10th session of the National Assembly was held at 3:40 PM on the 15th, with 1,745 people in attendance. The sixth group of the presidium was on duty, chaired by Zhu Jiajian. After the minutes of the ninth session were read by the secretariat, the agenda for the day began, continuing the reading and review of economic and political reports. There were a large number of requests to speak over the past two days. The assembly on the afternoon of the 15th was extended until 6:30 PM, but only 19 people had the opportunity to speak. Before the adjournment, the chairman asked the representatives whether those who had not had the opportunity to speak could send their written opinions to the secretariat for compilation and forwarding to relevant departments for written replies, which was agreed upon without objection.</p>
<p>The focus of today's speeches was mostly on rising prices and criticism of wealthy capitalists.</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Pingyu, a female representative from Hubei, loudly called for the liquidation of wealthy capital. She specifically proposed that the list of large merchant clients who made special contributions for relief should be published quickly, that distribution should be fair, and that it should be handled quickly so that by the time the donations are received after prices have risen, they will not be enough to buy two loaves of bread. At the same time, she advocated the liquidation of wealthy capital and bureaucratic capital, because their leadership is the real cause of rising prices. Xu's speech received applause from the entire venue. Several other representatives also spoke on this matter:</p>
<p>Lin Zigui from Fujian stated: The general rise in prices is led by the price increases of state-owned and public enterprises. Therefore, we should quickly order all regions to find ways to bring prices back to the levels before April so that ordinary people can maintain a minimum standard of living.</p>
<p>Su Ting from Suiyuan stated: The current national tax revenue is mostly borne by the poor, resulting in a situation where the poor pay to maintain the country's expenses, which is actually the poor protecting the rich. At the same time, she proposed that the government should subsidize impoverished provinces.</p>
<p>Wang Kongan from Shaanxi stated: Our economy should be built on the foundation of the Three Principles of the People, not on capitalism. However, the current phenomenon is that wealth is concentrated, speculative capital is rampant, and there is no implementation of capital control or equalization of land ownership. At this critical moment for the survival of the nation, he proposed that special relief donations and special donations from wealthy households must be forcibly collected, and he believes that foreign aid is important, but the most important thing is self-reliance.</p>
<p>Gao Xin from Guangdong pointed out: (1) The foreign exchange policy is wrong. Official prices and exchange rates force 200 million US dollars of overseas remittances to flee to Hong Kong every year. (2) The export exchange settlement method is inappropriate. Due to the limitation of the official price, merchants are hesitant to proceed. (3) Import quotas are restricted, causing several factories in Guangzhou to close down. (4) On what basis is the transport of cotton cloth to the south prohibited? The Ministry of Economic Affairs should reply.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese representative Huang Jingcan believes: Overseas Chinese have contributed greatly to the motherland, and overseas Chinese have purchased a large number of US dollar savings certificates in 1940, but the repayment method has not been resolved to this day, causing overseas Chinese to complain. At the same time, he proposed that the government should improve its policy of protecting overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Short-Term Treasury Bill Regulations, Revised Code of Criminal Procedure, and Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its 352nd regular meeting at 9:30 AM on the 15th, chaired by President Sun Ke. The minutes of the previous meeting were first approved, followed by Secretary-General Lou Tongsun's report on the National Government's directive that subsequent revisions to postal and telecommunications rates must be reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan before they can be implemented. It was held that the special permission to adjust postal and telecommunications rates during the critical period of suppressing rebellion was the same as the authorization to adjust tax revenue. The Legislative Yuan's resolution did not hinder the implementation of this temporary resolution made by the State Council. The discussion items then proceeded: (1) Draft Regulations on Short-Term Treasury Bills of the Republic of China in 1948, passed. (The text is on page 2) (2) Draft Amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, amended and passed. (The text is on page 2) (3) Draft Amendment to Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the Organizational Regulations of the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Ministry of Interior, passed. (4) The loan agreement between the Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of the United States for the purchase of cotton (signed on March 14, 1946, with a credit of 33 million US dollars) and its extension agreement (public letter of September 12 of the same year) were retrospectively approved. (5) The contract for the sale and transfer of ships between the United States and the contract for the sale and purchase of ships built during wartime between the US Maritime Commission and the Government of the Republic of China (both signed on July 15, 1947, to purchase old ships cheaply) were retrospectively approved. (6) The agreement on the issuance of travel documents to refugees under the jurisdiction of the International Refugee Committee was passed, and it was recommended that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instruct all overseas consulates to handle entry visas carefully after the agreement is implemented. (7) Draft amendment to the Martial Law, amended and passed. (The text is on page 2) As for the draft organizational regulations of the supervisory committee of the Control Yuan submitted by the Control Yuan, it was resolved to postpone the discussion because it was not appropriate for the current Control Yuan to formulate its internal organization on behalf of the new Control Yuan. The draft organizational law of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics was resolved to be re-reviewed after the Political Affairs Conference decided on its name, status, and whether to add a "Design Bureau" under its jurisdiction. The draft amendment to the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan related to it was also postponed accordingly. The draft amendment to the Budget Law and the draft amendment to the Air Defense Law were scheduled to be discussed at the next meeting due to lack of time. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Representative Pan Gongzhan spoke on behalf of the Shanghai representatives, raising four points: (1) Shanghai is an economic center, and some people accuse Shanghai of being extravagant, luxurious, and full of speculative capital. Where does this speculative capital come from? Does Shanghai print its own banknotes, or does speculative capital from all over the country gather in Shanghai? The responsible authorities should investigate the source of the speculative capital. (2) Shanghai prices were 6 to 7 times higher in 1946 than in 1945, and 20 times higher in 1947 than in 1946. The government implemented a policy of stabilizing prices in 1947, so why did prices rise even higher? The government should provide an explanation. (3) There are many reasons for high prices and high wages in Shanghai. The biggest reason is the repeated increases in the official foreign exchange rate. Every time prices stabilize slightly, the foreign exchange rate must be adjusted once. The reason is that the people who manage foreign exchange are the people who control foreign exchange. Therefore, the central government has consistently refused to implement the import and export linkage system requested by the Shanghai business community. (4) The land disposal measures passed by the Central China Pacification Conference recognize the policy of selecting and retaining communist party members. In the future, people in non-pacified areas will also follow suit. Therefore, we must promote our land policy and not follow the communist party and retain its demarcation methods. Pan's speech was met with applause from the representatives.</p>
<p>Ma Yi, a representative of the Heilongjiang Farmers' Association, expressed dissatisfaction with the takeover of the Northeast and regretted the unclear destination of materials. He believes that the takeover has not won the hearts of the people, but has lost them all.</p>
<p>Zhang Baozi from Shenyang believes that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty caused the current crisis in the Northeast, and the government should quickly propose solutions.</p>
<p>He Defu from Shanxi pointed out that the current famine in Jin Province is severe, the government has no relief measures, and the requisition of military grain is purchased at low prices, placing a heavy burden on the people.</p>
<p>Zhang Tingkan from Yunnan proposed that the method of collecting grain should be changed to a reform tax to reduce abuses.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives on Hunger Strike Jointly Petition Chairman Chiang, Expressing Gratitude, Soliciting Comfort, and Demanding Attendance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Chairman Chiang sent representatives to comfort the eight representatives on hunger strike the other day. Out of gratitude, they recently jointly wrote to the chairman, expressing two points: A. They sincerely thanked the chairman for his comfort. B. Regarding the issue of the signing of representatives attending the assembly, they implore the chairman to find a solution as soon as possible. The letter was delivered to Yu Bin by Ma Wanche and Sheng Zizhuang on the morning of the 15th, and Mr. Yu scheduled to meet with the chairman on the 16th to discuss it. Regarding the issue of the signing of representatives, there was no solution on the 15th. The motion proposed by 1,321 National Assembly representatives was submitted to Chairman Chiang, and on the 15th, the chairman replied to Yu Bin, Wang Chonghui, and one other, stating that he had approved the case and handed it over to relevant election officials to draft measures for review.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] The new Chairman of Hubei, Zhang Dulun, took office this morning, and the handover procedures between the new and old administrations were completed simultaneously.

<h3>National Assembly Representative Kong Xianrong, of Songjiang Antu County, Commits Suicide in Nanjing, Despairing that Volunteer Army Was Disbanded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Another representative has passed away during the National Assembly. Kong Xianrong, a representative from Antu County, Songjiang Province, committed suicide in his hotel at around 5 PM on the 15th due to anxieties about the national crisis and the destruction of his family. He was found to be already dead. The aftermath is being handled by the National Assembly Secretariat, and the body was transferred to the China Funeral Home that night. Kong was 68 years old and had served as commander of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, commander of the Northeast Security Zone, and commander-in-chief of the Jiyuan Anbian Zone. Kong's command was revoked when the former Northeast troops were reorganized, and his duties were also removed. Kong has a wife, two sons, and two daughters-in-law. When Yongshi retreated, his wife and one son and one daughter-in-law were captured by bandits. Another son and daughter-in-law are stranded in Changchun, and he has a nephew currently detained in the Beijing Model Prison. After arriving in Beijing on the 7th, Kong saw that his niece and daughter-in-law were also in dire straits. At the same time, he felt deeply that the communist bandits in the Northeast were becoming increasingly rampant, and he felt that his heroism was useless, so he decided to commit suicide to awaken the Chinese people and strengthen the advancement of military suppression of bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Wang Xingzhou, a representative from the Northeast, reported on the suicide of Kong Xianrong, a National Assembly representative from Songjiang, during the Presidium meeting on the evening of the 15th. The Presidium expressed regret and sympathy for Kong's suicide and decided to advise the National Government to provide preferential treatment to his family and commend his anti-Japanese achievements. The coffin was closed at 2 PM on the 16th, and National Assembly representatives should go to pay their respects that evening. Kong's body has been transferred to the China Funeral Home. Mo Dehui and Northeast representatives are scheduled to pay their respects at 8 AM on the 16th. Mo told reporters with tears in his eyes that the main reason for Kong's suicide was that his volunteer army was disbanded by the authorities. Although he repeatedly negotiated with the authorities after coming to Beijing, there were no results. Now this tragedy has occurred, and I couldn't help him, I'm really sorry to him. Du Yuming also told reporters on the evening of the 15th that Kong was loyal and brave in defending the country by fighting against the Japanese and suppressing bandits in the Northeast. He expressed extreme sadness that he committed suicide. I had invited him for dinner on the 14th, and when he talked about the disbandment of the volunteer army, he expressed extreme sadness. I didn't expect that he would commit suicide only a day later, which is very regrettable. Kong followed Du to return to the Northeast, and Du had appointed Kong as the commander of the Second Detachment, responsible for guerrilla warfare near Jilin.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender Issuance Amount Confirmed: 69 Trillion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Confirmed news: The amount of legal tender issued as of the end of March this year was 69,682.1 billion yuan. The tax revenue for this year from January to March was 11,868.4 billion yuan, accounting for 60.23% of the total revenue of 19,704.3 billion yuan and 23.6% of the total expenditure of 50,170.9 billion yuan. The feature of this year's budget for the first half of the year is that ordinary expenditures are balanced by ordinary revenues (i.e., increased tax revenue). So far, the ordinary part has maintained balance, but the special part is inevitably exceeded during the period of suppressing rebellion. However, with US aid having been approved, the situation in the second half of the year can be expected to improve.</p>
<h3>National Army Recaptures Hejian and Dacheng in Hebei; Bandits Wander Southwest of Wuyang in Henan; National Army in Weixian, Shandong, Still Holds on to the City Gates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The National Army's Civil Salvation Vanguard recaptured Hejian at noon on the 15th. The area was the CCP's military and political center in Hebei, as well as an important supply station. There are many factories and warehouses, and the war results are being investigated. In addition, Dacheng, 75 kilometers from Tianjin, was recovered on the morning of the 14th, following the recovery of Qing County.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Military news: After recapturing Dacheng and Hejian, the troops directly attacking central Hebei are expanding their sweep. 4,000 dan of grain seized in Dacheng were used to relieve the poor. On the afternoon of the 14th, more than 1,000 communist bandits were defeated near Dacheng, and more than 150 were captured and given funds to return home on the spot.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 15th] The 7th column of bandits who fled to Xu Shui Cao Hejian on the 14th were largely annihilated after the Baoding National Army launched an attack and severely suppressed them, and the remnants collapsed and retreated eastward in a state of distress.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 15th] The Liu bandits' 3rd and 6th columns wandered in the southwestern area of Wuyang yesterday and today. The Liu bandits' 2nd column and the Chen bandits' 10th column fled west to Niutijie from Shahedian on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The siege and defense battle of Weixian city gates continued all night on the 14th. The defending troops in the north gate fought fiercely, using a dense network of fire to seal off the city gates and annihilate more than 2,000 bandits who invaded the Bayajie street in the city, ensuring the position. The battle on the southwest two gates was also fierce, with the South Barracks being lost and regained several times. On the 15th, except for the east gate, the west, south, and north three gates were all in a fierce battle. The National Air Force assisted with continuous flights to Weixian, creating brilliant results.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyang, 15th] The bandit troops outside Changchun fled north, with one unit of more than 10,000 men, now transferred back to northern Songjiang. The bandits are deliberately creating a false impression, and their Second Column has fled south from Nong'an to Faku, with a tendency to disturb western Liaoning. The threat to Changchun seems to have been lifted, and the focus of future battles may shift to western Liaoning.</p>

<h3>Record of the National Assembly: From Enthusiasm to Indifference</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The National Assembly has convened for seventeen days, and today (the 14th) it begins the constitutional amendment process. As some representatives were not satisfied with the review of political and economic reports, the presiding officers decided on today's agenda, divided into two parts: the morning session (Ninth General Assembly) to discuss the constitutional amendment (first reading), and the afternoon session (Tenth General Assembly) to continue the political and economic review. The agenda was distinctly different, and the representatives' emotions were also distinctly different, showing enthusiasm in the morning and indifference in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Due to the unpleasantness at the close of yesterday's session, the Presidium was concerned about two issues when presenting the constitutional amendment for discussion this morning: one was the fear of dissatisfaction among the representatives, and the other was the fear that the number of representatives present would not meet the constitutional requirement of three-quarters. At the start of the meeting at 9:38 a.m., both issues were resolved smoothly. The number of attendees today was particularly high, second only to the day President Chiang delivered his speech, reaching 2,032, just enough to exceed two-thirds of the statutory 3,045 people. A report by Pan Gongzhan on behalf of the Presidium dissuaded the representatives from opposing the agenda. Chairman He Chengjun, speaking with a Hubei accent, announced the discussion of the constitutional amendment. Hong Lanyou reported on the procedures for handling the constitutional amendment proposals, repeatedly apologizing for the proposals not being delivered to the venue until after the meeting started due to printing issues. None of this caused any problems, but regarding the issue of what fraction of the total number of representatives was required, someone shouted from the balcony: "Please, Chairman, explain whether the total number refers to the legally mandated total number or the total number of those elected?"</p>
<p>Hong Lanyou's explanation did not satisfy the speaker. The Chairman's response was delayed, and someone shouted again: "Why doesn't the Chairman answer more quickly? The Chairman cannot manipulate the meeting!" There was booing from downstairs, indicating that the opinions of this small minority, even just one or two people, were not taken seriously. The Chairman said: According to the Constitution, only the Judicial Yuan has the authority to interpret the Constitution; the issue of the total number will be referred to the Judicial Yuan by the Assembly for interpretation. At this time, the original text of the constitutional proposals was being distributed upstairs and downstairs. There was an uproar upstairs, startling the Chairman. It turned out that some people were fighting over the proposals, causing some minor disturbances.</p>
<p>The first reading of the Constitution was considered to have begun. The six proposals that met the requirements were read out one by one, with the proposers explaining the main points separately. Zhang Zhiben's proposal was presented first, and his amendment received unprecedentedly enthusiastic and prolonged applause from the entire venue. It seemed that his opinion was exactly the opinion of the entire venue. Mo Dehui's proposal to enact temporary provisions also received enthusiastic support from the entire venue. These two proposals were the essence of the constitutional amendment. The four proposals by Liu Weichi, Gao Wei, Pu Ru, and Sun Shengwu focused on partial modifications and naturally met no opposition. The only prominent interlude during the first reading was when Zheng Chuqing, a female representative from the Youth Party, spoke out against the prevailing opinion and opposed amending the Constitution during this period of suppression of the rebellion. However, she suffered the same fate as Liu Huan, with a chorus of boos from the venue, preventing her from continuing. Although she shouted into the microphone to demand the right to speak, her voice was drowned out by the noise. This interlude fully demonstrated the enthusiastic emotions of the representatives. The meeting lasted for two and a half hours in the morning, and no one "drew straws," almost all of them focusing their attention on listening to the content of the proposals and the proposers' explanations.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the number of attendees was only 1,541, a quarter less than in the morning. Afterwards, they continued to "draw straws." After the break, it was estimated that there were no more than a thousand people. At 6:00 p.m., Chairman Zhu Jiahua announced a half-hour extension, but many representatives left regardless. At the close of the meeting, there were at most six or seven hundred people in the venue. Fortunately, it was a review, not a vote; otherwise, the number would have become a problem again. However, the continuation of the political and economic review was fought for by several representatives banging on the chairman's table, but they did not expect the representatives to have such indifferent emotions, with some not coming at all and others leaving halfway through. The indifference of the afternoon and the enthusiasm of the morning provided an interesting contrast.</p>
<p>One hundred and forty people requested to speak, which was not permitted due to time constraints. This afternoon, the representatives who spoke were very diverse, including those from Northeast, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shanghai, overseas Chinese, and professional organizations. They almost unanimously criticized the impropriety of diplomacy, finance, economics, food, and governance. Their impassioned arguments received applause from the entire venue, but because the number of attendees gradually decreased, both speakers and listeners seemed unable to muster enthusiasm. Therefore, when the Chairman announced, "Representatives who have not spoken are requested to submit their opinions in writing," no one expressed any further opposition. At 6:30 p.m., Zhu Jiahua announced the adjournment of the meeting, and there was a cheer in the venue. This cheer may have been the only expression of intense emotion in the entire afternoon of indifference. (April 15th, Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Editorial: The International Situation and China's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The National Assembly held its eighth general meeting on the morning of the 14th, during which Foreign Minister Wang Shijie delivered a report on foreign affairs. In addition to explaining our country's attitude towards world peace, he also reported on the evolution of Sino-American relations and the four major obligations that the Soviet Union has to China: (1) All Soviet troops, except those in Lushun, must withdraw from Northeast China; (2) The Soviet Union must not provide any assistance to the Chinese Communists who are resisting the National Government; (3) The Soviet Union must not interfere in China's internal affairs in Xinjiang; (4) The Soviet Union must genuinely respect the independence and autonomy of Outer Mongolia. Finally, he also stated our country's policy towards Japan, advocating that future peace with Japan must guarantee that Japan cannot engage in aggression again, but in terms of economics, he does not oppose the self-sufficiency of the Japanese people. From Foreign Minister Wang's brief report, one can also see a general outline of our country's current foreign policy, but it is very obvious that it lacks a spontaneous, progressive, and revolutionary spirit. Its recognition of the international situation after World War II also lacks foresight and prescience. Everyone knows that diplomacy and national defense are the two major weapons for defending a country's survival. In countries where national defense is not very strong, the importance of diplomacy is even more keenly felt. Especially in today's rapidly changing international situation, the use of diplomacy is particularly needed to seek national security and the realization of national policy.</p>
<p>We in the newspaper business are buried in piles of news every day, organizing, researching, and titling, not only understanding our country's domestic situation but also coming into contact with international politics. Therefore, we would like to take the opportunity of the National Assembly's review of China's foreign policy to put forward a few suggestions for the reference of the National Assembly representatives and foreign affairs authorities.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that the international situation after World War II has undergone a complete transformation after two years of evolution. Looking back at modern history, after the end of any international war, a peace conference is bound to be convened to clean up the aftermath of the war. Therefore, the international issue after the war must be how to deal with the defeated countries. The Congress of Vienna in 1814 and the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 are excellent examples. Similarly, after the end of World War II, the so-called international issues, in Europe, were the German issue; in Asia, the Japanese issue. However, for two years, the Allied powers have not been able to agree on a common policy for either the German issue or the Japanese issue. Not only has the peace conference with Germany and the peace conference with Japan not yet been convened, but the opinions of the major powers, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, have diverged and become increasingly distant, making the current international issue the US-Soviet issue. In this situation, it only benefits the defeated countries. Taking Germany as an example, the United States is actively supporting Germany there as an anti-Soviet fortress for the United States in Europe. The Soviet Union also wants to use the anti-American sentiment of the Germans to incite the Germans to launch an anti-American movement. The US-Soviet struggle in Berlin is for this purpose. Looking back at Japan, the defeated has broken into a smile because the American government and the public are filled with calls to support Japan's recovery. The only one to be pitied is China, which won but did not benefit. Japan's recovery is a threat to China's security, which Foreign Minister Wang said that our country's policy towards Japan is that militarily, Japan must not be allowed to engage in aggression again, but economically, it does not oppose the self-sufficiency of the Japanese people. On the surface, this policy towards Japan is fair and reasonable, but in reality, there are still problems. In modern international warfare, military and economic affairs are inseparable. Japan's economic recovery is the restoration of Japan's aggressive forces, which no one can deny. This is one point. Arming Japan as an anti-Soviet outpost for the United States in the Far East is not only advocated by some in American public opinion, but Japan is also using this to ingratiate itself with the United States. If our country advocates strict military control to ensure that the peace treaty can guarantee that Japan will not engage in aggression again, how can it be implemented? Simply following the United States will inevitably lead to historical mistakes. The Japanese misunderstand that our country's public opinion on Japan is close to that of the United States, which is a major flaw in our country's policy towards Japan.</p>
<p>Second, we advocate that diplomatic policies should not be immutable but should be used flexibly to adapt to the international environment. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country fought alongside the United States while maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union and accepting Soviet aid. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country accepted US aid while signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which is sufficient to show that our country not only wishes to coexist peacefully with the US and the Soviet Union and cooperate closely to ensure peace in the Far East and the Pacific, but also acts as a bridge for peaceful cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union, promoting understanding between the US and the Soviet Union and jointly creating world peace. Taking this diplomatic policy in the international environment at the time can be said to be appropriate. Because the urgent demands of our country and people after the war are nothing more than construction and recovery, which naturally require international peace and also require US economic assistance and technical cooperation. Also, because China and the Soviet Union share a border of thousands of kilometers, the friendship of the Soviet Union is naturally also needed by our country. Therefore, we do not hesitate to pay any price to sign a treaty of friendship and alliance with it. However, for two years, the continuation and expansion of internal strife have affected our country's international status, preventing our diplomatic policies from achieving the expected results. On the one hand, we urgently need US economic assistance, creating a mistaken impression on the US that our country relies solely on foreign aid and does not know how to rely on its own efforts. Therefore, the US and its public opinion often criticize our country, which limits US economic aid to China. On the other hand, although our country does not hesitate to pay any price to pursue the friendship of the Soviet Union, the result is that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has become a treaty of friendship that our country unilaterally fulfills. The major obligations borne by the Soviet Union have not been realized. Foreign Minister Wang's impassioned appeal at the National Assembly the day before yesterday, demanding that the Soviet Union earnestly fulfill its obligations, shows that our country has paid a heavy price but has not been able to exchange it for the friendship of the Soviet Union. From this, we really cannot help but admit that the inferiority complex of the foreign affairs authorities has led to the failure of our country's diplomacy.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that the bipolarization of the world is becoming increasingly clear. In the US-Soviet contradiction, being pro-American or pro-Soviet is not the way out for our country, but rather easily invites unexpected disasters. According to the old saying, we only have one unbreakable principle, which is independence and self-reliance in foreign affairs. Only by taking both approaches can we maintain the balance of power in the Far East. If we can constantly strengthen ourselves and become the only stabilizing force in the Far East, we can obtain the friendship of the Soviet Union even without paying any price. If we can be self-reliant and able to bear the responsibility for peace in the Far East, the United States will be afraid that China will not accept its assistance, so where will any problems arise!</p>
<h3>The United States Will Send a Delegation to China to Discuss the Implementation of the Aid Act; US Aid Will First Allocate 50 Million to Purchase Cotton, Rice, and Gasoline</h3>
<p>[Washington, Fifteenth, United Press] It was learned today that Hoffman, Director of the European Recovery Administration, will send a delegation to China to discuss implementation of the aid plan as soon as a new agency to implement the China Aid Act is established.

At the same time, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai has sent telegrams to the State Department and congressional leaders here, demanding that the China Aid Plan must follow the path of private trade as much as possible to protect the position of American businesses in trade with China and the Pacific. The State Department is currently considering this.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] According to financial authorities, the use of US aid is being discussed by the Executive Yuan and the US government. Once approved by the US Congressional Appropriations Committee, it can be disbursed. Before approval, the Reconstruction Bank will first allocate 50 million US dollars, the use of which has been proposed by our government, namely to purchase cotton, grain, and gasoline. Orders are currently being placed, and once approved by the US aid implementers, they can be disbursed separately.</p>

<p>[Hangzhou, Fourteenth, This Newspaper] No. 60 Jingjiang Road, Hangzhou, is the residence of Deng Zhiou, a secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Cai Yiming, a commissioner of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau. Last month, due to a stove dispute, relations between Deng and Cai deteriorated. Mrs. Deng committed suicide out of anger. After the incident, Deng Zhiou sued Cai Yiming as the mastermind behind the tragedy and organized a "Support Association for the Tragedy of Mrs. Deng." According to the association's telegram, Mrs. Deng left a death note to her husband before committing suicide, which read: "Zhiou, I was forced to commit suicide by the Cai family over the stove dispute. He bribed the police, who dragged me and humiliated me. The court prosecutor ordered me to pay 2 million yuan in compensation. When I responded reasonably, I was again subjected to willful abuse and imprisoned in a wooden cage. I was allowed to go home in the evening, but the injustice and humiliation were unbearable. I will meet my children in the next life. Your despondent wife." According to the victim's family, "Mr. Cai temporarily moved downstairs in July last year. This was originally leased by Sun Benjie, a former provincial committee member. After Sun left, the owner of the Wuzhou Drugstore entrusted Cai to take care of it. Recently, the owner plans to move his family to Hangzhou for his own use and has repeatedly urged Cai to move with the owner's letter. Unexpectedly, he angered Cai. The stove does not belong to Cai, and Cai has neither a lease relationship nor has he ever paid for it. It is obviously an attempt to occupy it. Now, he has even gone so far as to dispute the stove, forcing a person to death. He immediately fled in fear of punishment. Later, police were sent to guard him, and the borrowed furniture was moved away early the next morning." Various circles in Hangzhou are closely watching the amicable settlement of the case.</p>

He solemnly denied the reports that these aircraft would fly to Italy on Sunday, the day of the Italian general election, for a demonstration.</p>
<h3>"Factory Guards" on Standby; Austrian Communists Brew Coup; Soviets Tighten Siege of Vienna</h3>
<p>[Reuters Vienna, 15th] Western Allied sources here deeply fear that the Soviet Union's restrictions on the movement of Western military personnel are preparing for the Austrian Communist Party to launch a coup. They point out that the Soviet Union has tightened its encirclement of Vienna to obstruct the movement of Western Allied military personnel. Soviet authorities have notified a certain Western Allied nation that when dispatching troops to Vienna, they must first notify the Soviet Military Headquarters. Furthermore, it is reported that Soviet Army Commander-in-Chief Kolasov will request a resolution at the Allied Commission on the 16th to restrict the ability of occupying forces' military personnel to be called upon to assist the Austrian police in emergency situations.</p>
<p>General concern is focused on the so-called "Factory Guards," organized by Communist workers in the Soviet zone. With a strength of approximately two thousand, they are a fully armed and highly mobile force, capable of serving as a strong tool for the Communist Party to launch a coup. The recent restrictions on Allied military personnel's movement issued by the Soviet authorities are largely aimed at British personnel, as the British zone is closer to Vienna. The Soviet authorities' main traffic restriction measures are targeted at highway traffic. In the event of an emergency, the highway is the only shortcut for Western Allied forces to advance to Vienna. Western Allied nations are unlikely to agree to the Soviet Union's request to cease Allied assistance to the Austrian police. This request superficially appears to protect Austria from Allied interference, but in reality, it facilitates the "Factory Guards," the Communist armed force, to enter Vienna without the ability of the Allied nations to help.</p>
<h3>Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany to Implement Currency Reform</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 15th] It is reported that the Soviet military administration in Germany has received orders from Moscow to proceed with detailed plans for currency reform in East Germany. The Soviet military administration has instructed the German economic and financial authorities in the Soviet zone to carry out this task. Sources close to the Soviet military administration and the German administrative authorities say that currency reform in East Germany could be implemented by the end of May or early June.</p>
<h3>Rumor of a Hundred Soviet Tanks Gathered in the Southern Suburbs of Berlin</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 15th] British officials reported on the 14th: Approximately one hundred Soviet tanks entered the southern suburbs of Berlin on the evening of the 14th. It is claimed that the forest area where the tanks entered is approximately three miles from the American zone of Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 15th] It is said that Soviet authorities have taken note of the British report that Soviet troops and tank convoys have concentrated near Berlin, even within the city of Berlin. Soviet sources say that this news is purely provocative and will be responded to.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes Abolition of the Death Penalty; Five-Year Trial Period</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 14th] The British House of Commons on the 14th abandoned party lines and, despite government opposition, passed by a vote of 245 to 222, abolishing the death penalty for murderers for a five-year trial period. If the bill becomes law, within the British Empire, only those convicted of treason, piracy with violence, and destruction of royal shipyards will be punishable by death. During this five-year trial period, British murderers may be sentenced to life imprisonment instead of being hanged. When the bill was unexpectedly passed, there was jubilation in the House of Commons. Members were extremely excited, cheering, shaking hands, and throwing paper. Such ecstasy was rare in the solemn House of Commons.</p>
<h3>Italian General Election Outlook; Ruling Party Confident of Victory</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Rome, 14th] Right-wing newspapers here today report that the Italian Communist Party has been greatly alarmed by the Soviet Union's rejection of the three-nation (US, UK, France) proposal to hold a meeting to discuss the return of Trieste to Italy. At the same time, American diplomatic observers believe that the Soviet Union's move shows that it has abandoned hope that the Italian Communist Party will win the national general election on the 18th. Prime Minister Gasperi, after returning from a speech in the north today, issued a statement expressing that the Christian Democratic Party is quite confident about the general election. However, the Communist Party's actions are as intense as ever. Six thousand people in Milan marched and demonstrated today under the leadership of workers, posting slogans and criticizing the Prime Minister. Gasperi and Communist leader Togliatti are scheduled to deliver their final campaign speeches in Naples tomorrow night, after which the people of the country will have twenty-four hours to consider whether to support or oppose the Communist Party in the vote on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 14th] Although the Eastern and Western powers are simultaneously exerting pressure on Italy, recent analysis shows that serious disturbances are unlikely to occur during the vote on the 18th, and large-scale riots, revolutions, or coups are not expected to occur after the election results are announced. According to Professor Feigis, director of the most important public opinion testing organization in Italy, the Taussa Institute, approximately 29 million Italian voters will participate in the election, but at most only 85 percent will vote, with the remaining 15 percent abstaining due to illness, distance, ignorance, or lack of interest. However, he expects that some parties will not hesitate to use improper methods to generate more votes, so the total number of votes cast may reach 90 percent of the total number of voters. The professor continued that he expects the Christian Democratic Party to win at least 40 percent of the votes, while the Communist Party group, if lucky, will not win more than 30 percent of the votes. Fei believes that leftists in northern Italy today are not as pro-Communist as they were in 1946. Communist forces north of the Apennine Mountains, except for Milan, as well as Bologna, Modena, and Parma, have suffered considerable losses, but in Rome and southern Italy, although the Communist Party is in the minority, its power is stronger than before.</p>

<h3>US Occupation Zone in South Korea Plans to Generate Electricity Independently; Resisting Soviet Power Outage Threat</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] US officials said on the 14th that the Soviet military administration had threatened the US by cutting off the electricity supply in the US occupation zone in South Korea. This pressure tactic is similar to those used on US transportation lines in Berlin and Vienna.

These supply ships can handle emergency power supply matters in the South Korean occupation zone.</p>
<h3>US Occupation Zone in Germany Orders Expulsion of Hungarian Representatives</h3>
<p>[Reuters Frankfurt, 15th] The US military government chief, Clay, recently ordered four members of the Hungarian expatriate community and eleven members of the Hungarian property restitution mission in the US military zone of Germany to leave the US military zone within forty-eight hours. Clay, in a memorandum to Hungary on this matter, pointed out that the Hungarian authorities refused US officials to enter Hungarian territory with a US expatriate train on January 21, 1946, and that the Hungarian authorities failed to prevent Soviet soldiers in Hungary from robbing and engaging in other undisciplined behavior against the train. Clay also said that unless Hungary can provide a satisfactory reply, the US authorities will continue to take other actions.</p>
<h3>Soviet Female Reporter Peterzhi Writes to Freedom of the Press Conference; Protesting Soviet News Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Geneva, 14th, United Press] It is reported that the Secretariat of the Geneva International Freedom of the Press Conference has received a letter from Peterzhi, a former Soviet female reporter in Shanghai. In her letter, she protested against the Soviet Union's news policy around the world. However, the Secretariat does not intend to take action on this matter.

<h3>All Vietnamese Parties Oppose Bao Dai as a French Puppet; Franco-Vietnamese Peace Talks Near Collapse</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Hong Kong, 15th] Sources close to the French side claimed today that the Vietnamese peace talks between France and Annamese King Bao Dai are nearing collapse. The reason is that the French attitude remains stubborn, and the Viet Minh insists on complete independence in political, economic, and military affairs. Party leaders do not want Bao Dai to be restored as a mere French puppet.</p>
<h3>Collector in Tsuruga, Japan Discovers Ancient Chinese Coin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 15th] A collector in Tsuruga Castle on the coast of Japan, Honshu, has discovered an ancient Chinese "Huoguo" coin from over 1,900 years ago. According to the Tokyo Minpo, Japanese archaeologists believe that this is currently the fifth such coin in the world. The coin was cast by Wang Mang and is extremely valuable. Professor Umehara of Kyoto Imperial University recently discovered one at a collector's home in Osaka, which is generally believed to be the fourth such coin. The Japanese people pay much attention to this. Takahashi, a collector at Tsuruga Castle, discovered after reading Umehara's report in a magazine that there was also a Huoguo coin among his family's collections spanning several generations.</p>

<h3>US-Soviet Army Strength Comparison; Bradley Supports Universal Military Training</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] Chief of Staff Bradley said today to the House Military Affairs Committee that if the United States does not implement universal military training, it must expand its regular army. The Soviet Union currently has 170 active divisions. Intelligence we have received makes clear that it can increase to over 300 divisions within 60 days. The Soviet Union's satellite states can mobilize 95 more divisions. The United States currently has approximately nine divisions. None of the divisions are fully staffed. At the end of World War II, the United States had 90 army divisions, 89 of which were stationed abroad. If we do not implement universal military training, the best security measure is to expand the regular army so that it can sustain a war for one year, pending the effect of mobilization. In other words, the United States needs a basic army of 125 divisions, approximately 1.5 million men.</p>
<h3>Under Heavy Machine Gun Nests; Inter-American Conference Resumes Yesterday; Bogota Still Chaotic; Conflicts Near Marshall's Residence</h3>
<p>[Reuters Bogota, 15th] The 21-nation Pan-American Conference, which was suspended due to the rebellion in Colombia since the end of last week, resumed today at the Presidential Palace in Bogota.

<h3>Passengers of the Wanli Steamer Detained in Communist Area; Possessions Looted, People Safe; Families Flying to Tianjin and Qingdao Today to Visit and Prepare to Contact the Communists for Rescue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tianjin, 15th] The Changcheng steamer, which sailed from Shanghai to Tianjin, sent a telegram after inspecting the situation of the Wanli steamer, stating: "The Wanli is sunk at the foot of the mainland mountain, with the deck fully exposed. It is obviously a shallow reef. If it were not in the Communist area, it would be very easy to salvage. No passengers drowned. The location is near the Communist area, and many passengers are blaming [the ship]. It is impossible to approach." According to a telegram from business circles: Yang Hexin, one of the passengers of the Wanli, wired Shanghai, saying: "Now out of danger, safely arrived in Yantai." It is heard that all personnel are safe, but their possessions have been looted by the Communists. The personnel may be sent out of the Communist area within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin, 15th] As of the afternoon of the 15th, the true whereabouts of the 452 passengers on the Wanli steamer aground north of Shengshan are still unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Wanli steamer of the Fumin Shipping Company ran aground at Bei Shengshan and sank, with passengers and crew landing and mistakenly entering the Communist area. Various details have been repeatedly reported in the news. According to the company's news yesterday, in response to the requests of the passengers' families, the company chartered a special plane from China National Aviation Corporation this morning, carrying nine representatives of the passengers' families, and five staff members from the company, to accompany them to Qingdao to inquire about the whereabouts of the passengers. Another group of personnel also took a flight to Tianjin this morning to contact Qingdao. Furthermore, according to a telegram from the company's Changcheng steamer, it went to the accident site of the Wanli steamer the night before. The night was dark, making it impossible to inspect. Upon the company's order, they waited until dawn and saw the Wanli steamer aground at the foot of the mainland mountain. Presumably, the bottom of the ship was punctured by a reef. The captain, fearing that the ship would sink, immediately accelerated towards the foot of the mountain, causing it to run aground in a shallow beach, thus avoiding sinking. Therefore, although the ship's hull has cracked open, the ship's waterline is above the water surface. It has been decided that all crew and passengers have disembarked. On the other hand, among the more than 400 passengers on the Wanli steamer sailing from Tianjin to Shanghai, there were 13 foreign passengers, including 9 Russian expatriates. It is heard that a certain Russian organization in this city received a telegram from these Russians reporting that Chinese and foreign passengers and crew were all very safe, but their exact whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>[Another Message] The families of the passengers of the Fumin Shipping Company's Wanli steamer have hired lawyers and organized the United Association of Wanli Steamer Passengers' Families. As of yesterday, more than 250 people had registered to join. Today, nine representatives from the association, including Zhou Xiaomin, Dong Henghua, and Lin Yanling, along with company personnel, took a special plane to Qingdao this morning to find ways to rescue them. The planned rescue method is to first have the special plane go to Qingdao to find out the whereabouts of the passengers and request the US and Chinese navies to send personnel to rescue them at the accident site. If there is still no information, all will fly to Tianjin and, together with the Tianjin passengers' families, board the Fumin Company's rescue steamer "Changcheng" and sail directly to Yantai to set up an office and then contact the Communist-controlled area to carry out rescue work.</p>
<p>Company Statement</p>
<p>Based on various reports, the person in charge of the Fumin Shipping Company issued a statement on the grounding of the Wanli steamer: "The Wanli steamer carries 452 passengers, including 336 men and 116 women, including 13 foreigners, and 93 crew members, and 488 tons of cargo. It ran aground near Shengshan on the 12th and sank at the foot of the mainland mountain, with the left side of the hull and the deck fully exposed. There are no signs of people on the ship. It is assumed that they have landed, but the area is controlled by the Communists, so it is difficult to send a ship directly for rescue at this time. However, the lives of the passengers are safe. They may be transferred to Yantai to escape danger. Furthermore, there is a temple on the mountain at the grounding site, as well as a village providing food and lodging, 21 miles from the accident site, and Yingyang County. The lives of the passengers can be safe."</p>
<h3>Ping Jade King Sends Telegram Arriving Safely in Yantai</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies to the Senate on Proposals Regarding Profit Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Senate previously stated that the current profit tax law calculates profits based on currency value, resulting in false profits and real taxes, which is unreasonable. It has drafted four methods: (1) To adapt to the currency value, industrial and commercial capital should be allowed to be adjusted in proportion to the average price index between the original registration year and the tax year. (2) To calculate profits fairly, changes in kind should be used as the standard for profit and loss. Only if the surplus of kind increases can the surplus be settled according to the latest price. (3) Appropriately increase the special treatment of tax officials. (4) Improve the industrial and commercial accounting system, issuing a unified bookkeeping standard, suggesting that the central government refer to and correct them. According to the Ministry of Finance's reply: "It has been found that the Income Tax Law has been revised and promulgated by the government order of April 1 this year. Among them, for the enterprise income tax item, the assessed capital amount has been abolished, and the net income amount is used as the tax base, and the asset valuation method has been leniently stipulated, and various unavoidable donations and expenses are also allowed to be generously listed, in order to reduce the burden. The improvement of commercial bookkeeping has also been circulated to various bureaus for trial implementation, which is in line with the purpose of the proposed amendment."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Again Sends Telegram Requesting Reduction of the Estimated Number of Income Tax Payments</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the Ministry of Finance's adoption of a six-fold prepayment method for this year's enterprise income tax is too much to bear for businesses, especially at a time when the people are poor and wealth is exhausted. In addition to Xu Jiguang, Du Yuesheng, and Luo Qinghua continuing to appeal on behalf of industry and commerce in Beijing, a special telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, earnestly stating that since the special excess profit tax law has been abolished, the estimated number of income tax payments should be based on the previous year's income tax paid, so that businesses and people can catch up with paying taxes and overcome difficulties together.</p>

<h3>Sale of Fishing Administration Fishing Vessels: Deciding to Select Ten for Initial Repair</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fishing Administration Office of the Custody Committee of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has sixty fishing vessels. It was previously decided that they would be sold to private fishermen, but because the application procedures had not been finalized and the repair work would take time, they have not yet been sold. It has now been learned that at its second meeting the other day, the Vessel Clearing Committee of the Custody Committee decided on three key points regarding the sale of fishing vessels: (1) After inspections by the shipyard and several external architects, it was decided to first select ten vessels with relatively minor damage from the sixty vessels prepared for sale and repair them. It is estimated that the repairs can be completed in about six weeks, and they will then be sold. (2) Although the contract for the distribution of fishing vessels has been agreed upon by representatives of the Executive Yuan and the United Relief Services and approved by the Custody Committee, the application procedures have not yet been finalized. The procedures were originally drafted by the Fishing Administration Office, but the Custody Committee did not fully agree after receiving them. Therefore, it was decided to send all relevant materials to the legal advisor of the Custody Committee for review and drafting. However, these procedures will also be announced in the near future. (3) Mr. Kirkpatrick, an American member of the Custody Committee, previously proposed that some of these sixty fishing vessels be offered for lease, but no specific plans were proposed. Therefore, the Vessel Clearing Committee will ask the original proposer to submit a fishing vessel leasing plan. Before the leasing proposal is approved, the original plan to sell the vessels will continue to be followed.</p>
<h3>Family Tragedy of a Puppet Army Brigade Commander: Li Baiying Accuses His Wife from Prison of Abusing His Young Son to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Baiying, the puppet army's third brigade commander under the command of Ren Yuandao, served as the commander of the Advance Army of the Lower Yangtze River Suwan Border Region after the victory. He was later sentenced to two years and six months in prison by the Jiangsu High Court on suspicion of being a traitor and is currently detained in the Jiangsu Military Prison outside the Changmen Gate in Suzhou. Recently, Li filed a complaint with the local District Prosecutor's Office, accusing his wife, Xu Hanqing, of embezzlement, adultery, abusing their young son to death, and destroying evidence. Li is now fifty years old, and his wife, Xu Hanqing, is thirty-three years old, already a significant age gap. After Li was arrested, according to the complaint, Xu not only did not try to rescue him but also destroyed Li's favorable evidence, leading to Li's imprisonment. On one hand, she had an affair with Tian Hanhua, an accountant at Yunzhong Girls' High School on Fuxu Road, abandoning the family and hiring lawyers Zhu Yongkang and Zhou Chunfang to file a divorce lawsuit in the local court. At that time, Li was imprisoned in Suzhou. The local court granted the divorce on January 17 of this year. On the other hand, she unauthorizedly sublet the building at No. 7 Rongkang Lane, 240 Moore Road, rented by Li to a person surnamed Xie, pocketed the money, and fled. Xu had a son, nicknamed Li Xiaodidi, who was only three years old. Xu, finding it inconvenient to live with Tian, abandoned Li Xiaodidi at the home of the old maid, Chen Ma, who abused him to death. Li then filed a complaint with the local District Prosecutor's Office. Currently, the District Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation. The plaintiff, Li Baiying, was escorted from the Suzhou Military Prison by guards to Shanghai to testify in court. After the interrogation, he was returned to Suzhou, and the defendant, Xu Hanxiang, was ordered to post bail.</p>
<h3>Small Loan Committee Decides to Raise Standards</h3>

<h3>House Tax to Be Collected Based on Rent: Two Supplementary Measures Defined; Distribution of Rent Survey Forms Begins</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's house tax collection method was previously resolved by the Municipal Council to be changed from the summer of this year to be calculated based on the actual rent paid by each household, at the same old tax rate. No resolution was made regarding self-occupied properties. The municipal government felt that implementation was extremely difficult. If the current value were estimated as the basis for calculation according to the house tax regulations, it would not only be of little help but would also inevitably lead to many disputes, and manpower and financial resources would be insufficient. Therefore, at the 119th municipal meeting, supplementary measures were passed: (A) For all (1) self-occupied houses, (2) houses that are rented without rent, (3) houses where part of the house is built by the resident, (4) false declarations, (5) failure to declare within the prescribed deadline, and (6) other similar situations, the house tax will still be calculated according to the original re-estimated full-year rental value of the 26th year of the Republic multiplied by a certain multiple, and the tax will be levied at the prescribed rate. (B) The maximum rent limit passed by the Municipal Council at its fifth general meeting was 9,000 times for commercial use and 7,000 times for residential use. It is now stipulated that in all cases mentioned above, the lower rate will be applied uniformly, based on the re-estimated full-year rental value of the 26th year of the Republic multiplied by 7,000 times, and the tax will be calculated at the prescribed rate. It is reported that the municipal government has sent this case to the Municipal Council for review and has instructed the Finance Bureau to comply.</p>
<p>[Additional Report] The Municipal Finance Bureau has recently printed a "Rent Survey Notice to Residents," notifying all residents to declare their actual rent payments within a limited time to begin collection.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jiangyun ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company departed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 13th. In transit, a first-class E-room passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea. According to the third steward, Zhao Pinxing, the passenger boarded the ship at around 3:00 PM on the 13th, wearing a gray tweed suit, with no luggage, only carrying two packages of food. After dinner, at around 8:00 PM, the passenger wanted to go out for a walk, but it was the time for collecting tickets, and all the doors were closed, so he could not go out and returned to his room. He left the room again at around 9:00 PM. It was not until 3:00 AM the next morning (the 14th) that it was discovered that he had not returned to his room.

<h3>Careless Lacquering Causes House Fire, Burning Three-Year-Old Child to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 8:40 AM yesterday morning, Tao Shixing (30 years old), a tenant in the attic of the two-story building of Lu Shunji Lacquer Workshop at 223 Puan Road, accidentally started a fire while cooking breakfast, which quickly spread to the rear building at 225 next door.

<h3>Destruction of Graves and Unauthorized Construction of Houses: Appealing to the Law</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] There is a vacant lot behind the old local court on Huining Road in the Nanshi area, owned by Shen Wenzhao and Xu Qingzhang. Xu's ancestral graves are also on the land. During Qingming Festival the other day, Xu went to sweep the tombs and saw that the land was being heavily developed with the construction of buildings. Xu found this very strange and informed Shen Wenzhao. After investigation, it was learned that the houses on the land were built by a "house-building gang" tycoon and would be sold after completion. After inquiring with the Baojia, it was learned that the occupant of the house was named Zhu Baorong. Negotiations with Zhu yielded no results, so they filed a lawsuit with the court, accusing Zhu of occupying the land and excavating other people's graves, requesting the court to order the house to be returned to its foundation and to return the excavated coffin and corpse to their original place.</p>

<h3>Monk Arrested for Receiving Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] When Zhu Jiangshi's family from Workshop 155 of Zhongfang 7 Factory at 155 Changshou Road in West Shanghai hired monks to perform rituals on the 14th, they discovered that the monk's hat was from the Ganlu Temple in Jiuyuncun, Caoyang Road, Zhabei. Someone secretly reported it to the Putuo Road Police Sub-Bureau. Zhu Shechang ordered patrol officer Xu Senfu and police officer Wang Xiaoqing to rush to the scene and take the monk to the bureau for interrogation. According to the monk, his name is Juecheng, the abbot of the Putuo Temple in Fa Hua Town. Last April, a monk named Liaoyi gave him a pawn ticket to redeem several monk's robes, two "Five Buddha Crowns," and other items such as table curtains, red robes, and ancestral robes. Liaoyi then sold them to monks Ru Ru and Guantong from the Hongqiao Shimin Village and the Jiangsu Road Dasheng Temple respectively. After further investigation by the original case officer, stolen goods were found in the above two places, and the two monks, Ru Ru and Guantong, were arrested and brought to the bureau. They confessed that last April, a major theft occurred at Ganlu Temple, and a few unscrupulous monks, including Liaoyi, colluded to steal and sell the items. They admitted to being greedy and buying them at low prices. They will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The fugitive thief, Monk Liaoyi, is still being sought for arrest.</p>

<h3>Sudden Increase in Dismissal Cases: Social Bureau to Convene Factories to Encourage Protection of Good Workers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to statistics from the Social Bureau, in the past half month, cases of factories dismissing workers and labor disputes have suddenly increased. Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Bureau, told reporters yesterday that this phenomenon occurred after the security authorities of the city arrested a large number of underground communist elements hiding in the labor community last month. Some factory owners took the opportunity to dismiss workers they had long been at odds with. As a result of this incident, the general workers are inevitably panicked, and those responsible for trade union work are even more silent and dare not argue. The owners feel that this is a great opportunity and take advantage of it. However, the government only arrests those who participate in communist work and have conclusive evidence. The government remains committed to protecting the occupational safety of good, honest workers. Therefore, the Social Bureau will soon convene factory owners in the city to come to the bureau for talks and persuade them not to allow similar situations to occur again.</p>
<h3>Lisheng Factory Closes and Dismisses Workers: Social Bureau Considers It Inappropriate; Mediation to Be Conducted Again Within Days</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Lisheng Iron Factory in the city recently applied to the Social Bureau to close the factory and dismiss all workers due to constant strikes and slowdowns by the workers. This case is currently being handled by the Mediation Section of the Social Bureau. Fan Kechang, the head of the Mediation Section, believes that the workers' demands are unreasonable, and the owner's use of closing the factory to deal with it is also inappropriate. Therefore, he ordered the factory to continue maintaining production. The factory has agreed to resume work, but proposed an exchange condition, insisting on laying off 23 workers. Fan Kechang will convene both parties again within days to conduct mediation.</p>
<h3>China Textile Staff Privately Grants Interest Discounts for Corruption: Accountant Suspected and Detained for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A corruption case occurred at the China Textile Corporation, which was investigated in court by the District Prosecutor's Office the other day. The China Textile Corporation's daily operating income in March reached approximately 3 billion to 4 billion, and it was stipulated that the funds should be deposited into the Bank of Communications daily. At the beginning of this month, an auditor from China Textile went to the Bank of Communications to audit the accounts and found that the remittance dates did not match the deposit dates. The person in charge of handling this was Fei Yuwen, a staff member of the cashier's office. Fei fled upon hearing the news. Subsequently, Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of China Textile, discovered that the accountant, Huang Zheng, was suspected of colluding with Fei in corruption and arrested Huang. Huang was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on the 10th of this month. The other day, Prosecutor Yu Bixin questioned him in court. According to Huang's confession, the corruption was committed by Fei alone. He only transferred 3 billion from Fei on March 13 due to a cash flow problem in his business, and he knew nothing about other situations. As a result, he was detained. According to the investigation, Fei's method of corruption was to delay the daily operating income from being deposited into the Bank of Communications by three or four days, or even up to half a month, and privately grant interest outside. Because the daily amount was as high as 3 to 4 billion, the interest figure was quite alarming. It is planned to send the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. As for the fleeing suspect, Monk Liaoyi, we are waiting for him to be arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Number 5 Generator Slightly Affected, Factory Electricity Slightly Affected</h3>

The situation is not serious, and it will take about a month to repair it and restore power supply.</p>
<h3>Yan Peixing Is Rumored to Be Feigning Insanity: The Reason Is Property Disputes; A Notable Answer to the "Insanity Mystery" Case</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yan Peixing "Insanity Mystery" case has developed to the point where, although the court is still waiting for the summons of doctors Han Fen and Huang Yingbang on the 27th of this month to debate whether Yan Peixing has a mental illness, the general public already has a very definite understanding of whether Yan is insane or not. The key point that people find incomprehensible is: if Yan Peixing is not insane, why did he write those bizarre notes? If he is indeed insane, why did his wife intentionally preserve those bizarre notes and photos? Although the couple has their own explanations for this mystery, they are clearly very far-fetched. Recently, a notable answer has been widely circulated: Yan Peixing initially cooperated with his wife to feign insanity, but the act turned into reality, almost causing him to lose his life.</p>
<p>To verify this claim, reporters specifically interviewed Yan Yuan and relatives close to them. Although they all denied the matter, their relatives, standing as third parties, believed that Yan Peixing did feign insanity, which evolved into a scene of "the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind," and behind the oriole is the tragedy of the insane.</p>
<p>According to what they said, there are two reasons for Yan Peixing feigning insanity. The first is to acquire the shares of other shareholders in his textile hardware factory, including the shares of his two nephews. The second is that during the enemy-occupied period, the factory's products were sold to peers and then resold to the enemy. Yan was afraid of being accused of being an economic traitor, so he feigned insanity to avoid it.</p>
<p>Origin of Huaxing Hardware Factory</p>
<p>Yan's Huaxing Textile Hardware Factory was not called Huaxing when it was founded in the 26th year of the Republic. At that time, the general distribution office on Henan Road was the "Xinyue Textile Supplies Manufacturing Factory," and the branch factory on Da Xi Road was the "Shenda Yarn Tube Factory." In addition to Yan's brother, Yan Peide, there were other shareholders in the former. The total capital at the time of establishment was 18,000 yuan, and the latter's capital was 15,000 yuan, one-third of which was owned by Yan Peide. In the 29th year of the Republic, Yan Peide went to Yixing Dingshan Zutan to sweep the ancestral tombs and was killed by the Japanese army in Taihu Lake on the way back. Then Yan Peixing took over the factory's affairs alone. By the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, the factory's business was extremely developed and had a considerable position in the textile hardware industry in Shanghai. At this time, Yan Peixing, on the one hand, wanted to avoid possible troubles after the victory, and on the other hand, was tempted by the considerable amount of property in the factory. After discussing with his wife, he feigned insanity and lived in Wuxi, deliberately writing bizarre notes and taking bizarre photos. Yan Yuan Baoying told people that Yan Peixing was insane, and the factory was in a mess and losing money. He told his two nephews and other shareholders: You should split the shares and operate them yourselves. As a result, the two factories actually split up. According to his two nephews, the property they received was less than half of their due shares. From then on, the New Pharmaceutical Factory and the Shenda Factory merged into the Huaxing Textile Hardware Factory, and his two nephews opened a smaller Renfeng Steel Wire Brown Factory in Zhoujiaqiao.</p>
<p>This general process is said to be Yan Peixing and his wife working together to deal with Yan's nephews Yan Xinwu and Yan Xintai. Yuan Baoying said that Yan's nephews wanted to seize their uncle's property, while Yan Xinwu and Yan Xintai said that their shares were swallowed up.</p>
<p>No Children for Ten Years, Unhappy Marriage</p>
<p>Now that the factory's shares have been unified, Yan Peixing's misfortune began within the family. Yan and Yuan had been married for more than ten years without having a son, which is the root cause of their disharmony. During the enemy-occupied period, Yan Peixing married two concubines, both of whom were found by Yuan Baoying, but soon they were intolerable to Yuan and were driven out. The first marriage was to the sister of Yuan's sister-in-law, which was broken up under the pretext of having body odor. Then he married a woman from the same village named Gui Xiu, who was said to have syphilis. It is said that the three of them went to the Third Medical People's Hospital on Tiantong Road and the Shude Hospital in the French Concession to test, but in the end, the poor Gui Xiu was driven out of Yan's house. Thus, they never had a son, and Yuan Baoying pinned her hopes on her nephew Yuan Xiangzheng. Yuan Xiangzheng's hometown was originally said to have only six acres of land, but now he has actually opened a "Tailai" textile hardware factory himself. Yuan Baoying wanted to marry her fifteen-year-old daughter to Xiangzheng as a live-in son-in-law, but Yan Peixing firmly opposed it, because first, the two were eight years apart in age, and second, they were too close in kinship. This conflict of opinions widened the rift between the couple, and Yan Peixing's mental illness had become well-known. In this way, Yan Peixing's entry into the Puchi Sanatorium finally happened.</p>
<p>Visiting Relatives at the Hospital, Confessing the Past with Tears</p>
<p>After Yan Peixing entered the hospital, his two nephews and other relatives went to visit him once. They had originally been skeptical of Yan Peixing's mental illness. In the hospital, Yan Peixing said with tears that he was sorry for them in the past and that he really did not have a mental illness, and asked them to find a way to save him. Later, his sister informed the Garrison Headquarters, and he was released.</p>
<p>Yan Peixing now deeply resents his wife and always says not to talk about the past. If he is really a "smart person" playing a comedy, the result is a character in a tragedy. It is conceivable that he has indescribable pain in his heart.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a family tragedy involving serious social issues. From the perspective of a citizen: First, were there armed men who escorted Yan Peixing when he entered the Puchi Sanatorium? Second, if Yan Peixing is indeed not insane, what responsibility should the hospital authorities bear for detaining him? Third, has Yan Peixing's property been encroached upon by behind-the-scenes figures? These important doubts need to be thoroughly investigated by the authorities to clarify the darkness in this society!</p>
<h3>Small Episode: Taking Steel Wire, Accused of Theft</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 5:00 PM yesterday, someone went to Yan Peixing's factory on Tianbao Road to take a large amount of steel wire. Subsequently, the accounting room reported to Yuan Baoying and reported the theft to the Tilanqiao Police Sub-Bureau. After investigation by the police station, it turned out that Yan had agreed to the move, so it was not accepted.</p>

<h3>Low-Interest Export Loans</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Implemented Since Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Guangzhou, 14th] Low-interest export loans in Guangzhou were implemented today (14th). All exporters with actual proof can apply for loans. The terms are divided into two types: three months and one month. However, although exporters are interested in low interest rates, they must settle foreign exchange according to the official price, so the application is unlikely to be enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Amounts on Drafts and Vouchers: Unit Allowed in Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Clearing House received a telegram from the Bankers Association yesterday, relayed from the Ministry of Finance on April 9, instructing each clearing house to exchange drafts and vouchers, and the amount should be in yuan as the smallest unit, rounding off below one yuan. The Clearing House decided to comply starting from the 16th.</p>
<h3>Bank Customers Should Use Real Names</h3>
<p>Remittances Must Also Be Handled Similarly</p>
<p>Regarding the use of real names by bank customers, since the National Government announced the "Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Names," the Ministry of Finance issued a general notice to all banks and financial institutions that all customer names should comply with the regulations and that it is no longer permitted to open accounts and deposit funds using shop names. Later, to avoid perfunctory violations, the Ministry of Finance formulated and promulgated the "Measures for the Ministry of Finance to Supervise Banks and Financial Institutions to Promote the Use of Real Names for Depositors." The main points are to stipulate that customers who have previously opened accounts under non-real names must change to real names within three months. Those who exceed the time limit will be transferred to a special account for withdrawal, without interest. In the future, depositors should use real names when opening accounts and should fill in their occupation and address, without any omissions. It is now known that regarding the names and addresses of domestic remitters, measures have also been formulated. All banks and financial institutions that handle domestic remittances, whether telegraphic transfers, mail transfers, or bank drafts, should have the remitters fill in the remitter's and payee's real names (or the full names of the institution, company, or manufacturer) and detailed addresses on the remittance application form, and the remitting bank should register the remittance account at any time, without any omissions.</p>
<h3>Market Hesitation and Fear: Yarn Market Still Weak Yesterday; Dye Factories Unload Cotton Cloth Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was sluggish, and sales on this street were also sluggish. Therefore, all levels opened at lower prices, and the fluctuations in the process also tended to be narrow. Although 42-count Blue Phoenix loudly called out 235.5 million in the middle, and 21-count Double Horse opened at 141 million, due to market hesitation and lack of upward momentum, plus speculators actively taking advantage of the opportunity, market prices continued to decline. The former finally closed at 232 million, falling another 1 million, and the latter once saw a low price of 137 million. By the time of the closing, speculators slightly hedged, and there was a slight rebound, ending at 139 million, continuing to fall by 4 million. Each grade of 40-count and 32-count fell between 1 million and 6 million, and each grade below 20-count continued to fall between 1 million and 3 million.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, all cloths were exhausted. Private dye factories, due to the continuous decline in grey cloth prices and the sufficient supply of spun-built companies, sold futures first, but customer demand was still lacking. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.74 million and gradually fell to 4.71 million, with few buyers. Each grade of fine cloth fell by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. 120s drill fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, and the rest tended to hover in a sluggish range.</p>

<p>Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, went to Wuxi yesterday to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Livelihood Investigation Committee and returned to Shanghai that night. He told reporters: "It was previously stipulated that Shanghai merchants going to Wuxi and other producing areas to purchase grain had to be issued a purchase permit by Shanghai and an exit permit by the Wuxi County Government. The procedures were too complicated, and merchants complained that it was inconvenient." He suggested to the Jiangsu Provincial Government authorities that this procedure be waived. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Grain and the Wuxi County Government agreed. However, in the future, each organization and group purchasing in Wuxi will still need to have a purchase permit.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>The rice market rebounded slightly. Because prices had been falling for days, the market had been sluggish for a long time. Yesterday, because the price of tin rose and rice shops on this street replenished their stocks, and because very little goods had arrived in recent days, sellers' willingness to sell also decreased. The market opened brightly, and prices rose by 50,000 yuan in the morning. White polished rice at the Nanshi Market was 3.7 million, and Tongbaiyuan and other varieties also rose by 50,000 yuan. Early thin rice rose by 100,000 yuan. The market became even stronger in the afternoon.

Yesterday, a total of 3,482 piculs of goods arrived at the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour: Slightly better, but transactions were calm. The market trend was minimal. Because there were still few customers, and limited replenishment on this street, but because of the rebound in rice prices, sellers also had the intention of holding up prices.

<h3>Trade Representative to Japan, Zeng Jiyin, Discusses the Future of Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Chinese private trade representative to Japan was unable to start business due to the lack of visa accounting methods, and specially recommended representative Zeng Jiyin to return to China to request. Zeng has returned to China for more than ten days and has gone to Beijing several times to negotiate. It is now known that the visa accounting method for trade with Japan has been approved by the Executive Yuan and is being notified to all relevant agencies for reference. Zeng told reporters yesterday: "After the official documents of this method arrive at the Chinese delegation in Tokyo, the delegation can use this as a principle to negotiate with the Allied Economic Bureau and then agree on actual trade methods. Due to the shortage of foreign exchange in China and the lack of strong credit, it is necessary to export first to obtain foreign exchange and then use it to purchase Japanese goods for import. At present, the goods that China can export to Japan are tung oil, pig bristles, animal skins, and raw lacquer, etc., but the number that merchants can control may not be large. Due to the lack of foreign exchange in both China and Japan today, the short-term commercial outlook is not good. At the same time, Japan has some products that others welcome but China does not need. For example, last Christmas, an American businessman bought 100,000 children's toys and shipped them to the United States, where they sold well, but China has no such demand. The inconsistency of supply and demand is also one of the difficulties in Sino-Japanese trade." Regarding the general economic situation in Japan, Zeng said: "The speed of recovery of Japan's light industry is amazing; and its industrial and commercial circles are tightly organized, act consistently, and save food and clothing at home and export quality products with all their strength. This year, imports and exports will not only be balanced, but will also form a trade surplus. Japan is currently suffering from a lack of raw materials, and China can supply a part; but even if China does not supply, other countries will supply. For example, animal skins were originally imported by us before the war, but recently, 3 million tons have been ordered from Canada and more than 5 million tons have been ordered from Australia. Whether Sino-Japanese trade is beneficial to our national economy depends entirely on our own operation."</p>

<h3>Dagong Defeated Hualian: Won the Mayor's Cup Championship</h3>
<p>Green Team Defeated Shanghai English in the Women's Final</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The championship finals of the men's and women's groups of the Third Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament were held last night. The Municipal Gymnasium was crowded with 10,000 people, with 5,000 to 6,000 fans, an unprecedented situation, and there was no record in this season's basketball tournament. As a result of the fierce battle, the Dagong team defeated the Hualian team in the men's group, 45 to 38. In the first half, Dagong took the lead 20 to 19. The Green team defeated Shanghai English in the women's group, 46 to 35. In the first half, the Green team led 24 to 16. The Dagong Team and the Green Team won the championship of this year's Mayor's Cup.</p>

Huang Mingyuan and Cao Manli were active, 19 to 5 in the first quarter, and 24 to 16 in the first half.

<p>In the men's group final, the Dagong team relied on its youth, strength, and high-speed offense and accurate shooting to overwhelm the Hualian team. The wonderful performance was indeed outstanding and worthy of praise.

In the first half, 19 to 20, Dagong scored one more point. In the second half, at 22 to 10, Li came on the court, and the Hualian team's position was shaken and the dragons were leaderless. At 35 to 30, Lian Ke committed five fouls and was replaced by Zhan Chen. At 39 to 34, Wen Hua also committed five fouls and was sent off.

<h3>The Golden Age of Chinese Periodicals</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>—Memories from the Late Qing Dynasty to 1924</p>
<p>As a professional journalist, the author seems to have a blood relationship with the history of Chinese "periodicals," and has been paying attention to, and fond of them, from student days to the present. I feel that Chinese "periodicals" from the late Qing Dynasty to before 1924 had an indelible spirit of the times, which is worth recording and learning from. I would like to dedicate this article to readers and people who love periodicals.</p>
<p>What we first feel is not only not blameworthy, but also indelible, is Liang Qichao's "Xinmin Congbao" and "Qingyi Bao" edited in the late Qing Dynasty. Although his political and social reforms were limited to constitutional reform and did not advocate overthrowing the Manchu Qing government, and although he advocated a "virtual constitutional monarchy," he did introduce a large number of new ideas and systems from the world, giving China a powerful enlightenment in politics and society. He cleared up Zhang Zhidong's erroneous theory of "Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application," and we should not hesitate to give him a high evaluation. In particular, Liang's own skilled and unrestrained writing style opened the door to Chinese vocabulary, and his articles were so erudite and extensive, although the depth and density are not enough today; but at that time it was indeed the beginning of a bold trend; making people still think of that magnificent, magnanimous spirit today.</p>
<p>Later, another periodical "Min Bao," published in Yokohama, was a step further in Chinese political thought than Xinmin Congbao. It cleared up the latter's illusion about the Manchu Qing Dynasty and put forward the slogan of national revolution, challenging the constitutional reformists with a brand-new revolutionary posture. The editor was Zhang Ji, who recently passed away. Although he himself was not good at writing, there was no shortage of talented and broad-minded revolutionary party members who could compete with Liang Qichao in writing; because of the righteousness and strength, people felt a kind of vitality, a kind of domineering spirit. Recalling it now gives people a feeling of being from another world.</p>
<p>"Jiayin Magazine," published in 1914, was a powerful weapon for Zhang Shizhao to attack Yuan Shikai's Hongxian Dynasty, and completed the historical mission of revolution at that time. Zhang Shizhao's articles at that time were not only logically rigorous, but also full of vitality, vigorous and well-organized, not like Liang Qichao's unrestrainedness, nor like some people such as Dai Tianqiu and Wu Zhihui's "running wild," and truly integrated ancient prose, logic, and political commentary. Not to mention Mr. Zhang Binglin's simple, every word with a source and sharp articles, enough to kill the enemy. (Later, Jiayin was re-published in 1924 and became a publication praising Duan Qirui's government and slandering the founding father, which was of course a self-destruction of history, not only not worth watching, but also disgusting.)</p>
<p>Before this, "Eastern Magazine," and after this, "Pacific" and "Youth China" also had their historical value. The former two had some rigorous academic papers. Even today, they may not be completely ineffective, although world academia has made great progress in the past thirty or forty years. The latter's awakening of national self-esteem and its unwillingness to succumb to the rise of the great powers was truly a youthful spirit. Although today some of the writers at that time have transformed into politicians and forgotten their ancestors, they are happily abandoning their long-changed claims.</p>
<p>"New Youth," which became the new bible and biography of youth around the May Fourth Movement in 1919, not only fulfilled the enlightenment mission of Chinese new culture, but also laid the foundation for new thought. So many warriors from the old society rebelled and struck at the vital points of the old society. Thirty years have passed in a hurry, some have died, some have changed, and some have "married," giving people a feeling of white clouds and gray dogs. However, a periodical has such great power and influence. I am afraid that not only was it unprecedented in China's past, but it will be difficult to have again in the future.</p>
<p>"Yu Si," published in 1924, more or less inherited the tradition of New Youth. This small periodical was originally a publication casually launched by professors at Peking University, but it turned out to have a very important place in Chinese cultural history, which was due to its active attitude, unyielding battle against the Kuomintang youth who massacred the revolution and the pro-foreign Anfu clique government. Even the old man Zhitang, who later advocated diluting, was also attacking feudal forces and imperialists as a fighter at that time. And what is particularly worth mentioning is that the short commentary essays that have now grown into a powerful and universal genre were published at that time with "Idle Talk Collection" and "Our Idle Talk" as columns, collecting articles from many authors.</p>
<p>This article is limited in length and can only briefly discuss comprehensive periodicals. Pure literary periodicals representing the spirit of the times are not involved here. Let's stop here.</p>
<h3>On News from the Keyhole</h3>
<p>— Lin Ye</p>
<p>News from the keyhole has a variety of different names, to name a few of the more common ones: such as "inside news," "behind-the-scenes news," or "news behind the news," etc. Ultimately, there is only one meaning: anything hidden behind the covered part.</p>
<p>The value of this kind of news, as seen today, is "sweeping thousands of troops" and "unparalleled in the world." At the very least, it has become one of the targets of competition among journalists. Obviously, publications that win a large number of readers in the market have succeeded in this area. For example, "Xinwen Tiandi," which has been published in Chongqing and has maintained its existence to this day, has 40,000 readers; and the readers of Nanjing's "China News," which recently imitated it, are also gradually increasing; even "Guancha Zhoukan," which is known for its political commentary, does not dare to ignore this kind of news. The same is true from the perspective of Europe and the United States: in 1932, Drew Pearson, a Washington correspondent for the "Baltimore Sun," and Robert S. Allen, a Washington correspondent for the "Christian Science Monitor," jointly published a book called "Washington Merry-Go-Round," which made informal behind-the-scenes commentaries on the current political situation, and thus caused a sensation in the entire United States, resulting in a leap to become famous columnists.</p>
<p>Why is the value of this kind of news so high? Tracing its roots, there are roughly the following kinds:</p>
<p>First, news from the keyhole is the most difficult to obtain. If you can't find the way, can't find the keyhole, or don't have a key, you simply can't open the door. Sometimes, even if you find a fragment, it is accidental, or it is due to your own deduction, citation, and judgment. This kind of news that is not easy to come by is of course more precious than ordinary news.</p>
<p>Second, everyone always has something that cannot be made public, and things are the same. There are many places that need to be kept secret, but the more things that cannot be made public, the more strictly kept secrets, the more interested everyone is in them, so being able to satisfy this interest can gain a large number of readers. In other words, to gain a large number of readers, you have to compete with others in this area, and news from the keyhole becomes precious and important.</p>
<p>However, the following situation often occurs: many "secrets" that do not need to be concealed become valuable news once they are concealed. In other words, some news that originally had no value leaps to become the object of hunting by reporters after going through the "concealment" stage. This phenomenon is produced because of overestimating this kind of news.</p>
<p>Third, the facts that are concealed are often very important. They may cause a sensation in the entire society and the entire human race. The relationship between governance and chaos is very great, and therefore it is important.</p>
<p>The last and most important one: it is the most full of the meaning of Interest. The so-called Interest is the ability to provide new facts, creating new situations and new problems. Old news (facts) that are accustomed to seeing and hearing cannot arouse Interest; it carries rare, extraordinary, unknown, and unpredictable facts.</p>
<p>News from the keyhole is the most important news is undeniable, but the reporting cannot escape the constraints of the concept of news ethics, and everywhere must keep in mind a sentence: "I work for everyone's needs," and cannot violate conscience to fabricate facts, and even more cannot write some news that leads people to evil with inferior techniques.</p>
<p>Block publications and yellow newspapers, that is, the so-called "Shanghai style" news, are the most prevalent in Shanghai. Grasping the psychology of readers, they specialize in finding rumors in the streets and alleys, or fabricating some facts, such as publishing the secret history of big figures, releasing some news that can stir up and bewitch readers; with no factual basis, they are satisfied with just good sales and large profits. This is the tragedy of the news world and the obstacle of the newspaper industry.</p>

<h3>Difficulty in Hiring</h3>
<p>— Dan Sun</p>
<p>A housewife in Norfolk, Virginia, USA, has been very happy recently because the most troublesome "hiring" problem has been solved. She has hired a maid to come twice a week to help her with cleaning work.</p>
<p>One morning at half past nine, the maid came. At this time, the housewife was cooking breakfast. She thought the maid must like to have breakfast before working, so she made a particularly hearty breakfast, with fried eggs, bacon, and baked delicious biscuits.</p>
<p>"After you have breakfast," the housewife said, "wash these pots clean before scrubbing the kitchen."</p>
<p>"Madam," the maid announced, "I don't do any scrubbing work."</p>
<p>The housewife was a little surprised, but after thinking about it, it's better not to argue. So she suggested: "Okay, wash the pots first, and then go clean the bathroom."</p>
<p>"Madam, I've already told you, I don't do any cleaning work." The maid replied immediately.</p>
<p>"Do you mean," the housewife said, "come here, sit down and have a hearty breakfast; don't do any work, and then I'll give you wages, right?"</p>
<p>"Well, madam," the maid replied, "that was really a delicious breakfast. I guess it would cost seventy-five cents to eat in a restaurant."</p>
<p>So the maid took out seventy-five cents from her purse, put it on the table, added a dime of ocean, and strode away.</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of Lao Can's Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Dacheng</p>
<p>Two years ago in mid-spring, I traveled to Suzhou with a friend and went to the Baicheng Bookstore on Hulong Street. A book friend showed me Sun Yirang's Gu Zhou Shi Yi, saying that it had annotations, but he didn't know who wrote them. I took it and saw that the calligraphy on the cover was thin and firm. On closer inspection, the annotations had one or twenty items, all prefixed with the three characters "Biaoyun Case," which was indeed Liu Tieyun's (Lao Can) true handwriting. Biaoyun was proficient in the study of bronze and stone inscriptions, and in modern times, those who study oracle bone inscriptions also regard Tieyun as the ancestor. His novel "The Travels of Lao Can" is even more well-known and read by everyone. He had a very rich collection of books in his life, and there were quite a few fine Song and Yuan editions. He also mentioned them in the novel. The book friend's judgment was not accurate, so I got it at a low price, and I was ecstatic for many days.</p>
<h3>Five Quatrains</h3>

<p>Written on Receiving Mr. Xie Bin Hong's Painting of Wuyi Nine Bends</p>
<p>Ink and brush imitate Jing Guan, strange rocks and peaks hard to climb, my humble room now adds to the scenic beauty, I often feel like I am in Wuyi Mountain.</p>
<p>Inscribing Mr. Xian Zhao's Painting of Oak Trees at Han Temple</p>
<p>Every time I see the red cotton, I feel unbearable, half my life swaying in the river, when will I be able to set foot on Xiangqiao Stone again, leaning on the towering temple to face the blue mountains.</p>
<p>Inscribed on Bamboo and Rock Presented to Mr. Wu Jianlan</p>
<p>Not flaunting colors like ordinary flowers, a kind of purity and strangeness, who can pity, only the bamboo under Yunlin's steps, knows how to sweep away the clouds in the sky again.</p>
<p>Reply to Liu Zuochou in Singapore</p>
<p>Your superb skills are rare in the world, my leisure is unparalleled, in the autumn window, during the night of fine rain, when we linked poems, respectfully reading the rushing torrents amongst the pines. Silk thread fills the old dreams of Lian Tao, in the quiet west window, the shadow is lonely and sparse, but because the love of longing has not ended, I am not as good as you when trying to accompany to the new poetry.</p>
<h3>Idle Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Leisure on the Sea - 117</p>
<p>The letter read: "To Elder Yu Ru, I, Qi Wan, having received your teachings, am determined to thoroughly fulfill my promise. I have used various methods to sever all thoughts of Zhu Zhai. Not wanting to be dragged down to a point where my reputation is ruined, and realizing the environment does not permit me to, I believe many people must be gossiping, laughing at, and scolding me behind my back since I left Beiping. I have no way to defend myself. Only you, Elder, understand the intricacies of the matter and perhaps feel indignant on my behalf. I no longer have the face to return to Beiping and see my colleagues! However, I am not discouraged by this. I treat the past as if it died yesterday, and I will make a new start. I have followed my mother's advice and returned to the stage, partly forced by the need for livelihood and partly to dispel the boredom of my days. I will entrust my spirit to art, hoping to forget the wounds of the past. Fortunately, I have received much help from various quarters in Shanghai. Mr. Mei has officially accepted me as his disciple and guides and supports me. I recently performed in Shanghai and received a very warm welcome from the audience. I know these are but fleeting fame and dare not be complacent. Furthermore, these fleeting fame cannot relieve the pain in my soul. You, Elder, are a man of old virtues. You can understand that the fragile seedlings of a young girl's heart cannot withstand repeated destruction. Every day I drift along with the tide, performing on stage, and every night, when all is quiet, I am overwhelmed with emotions, my pillow wet with tears. I dare not tell others of this suffering, and only before you, Elder, can I pour out a word or two, hoping that you will have pity. How is Zhu Zhai doing lately? I have given him many bad impressions, which should be enough to stimulate him. I hope he hates me, hates me to death, only then will I find comfort in my heart.</p>
<p>If he knew all my actions, knew that I intentionally provoked him, the truth would cause him even greater pain. How to permanently hide this from him depends entirely on your judgment, Elder. I frankly tell you, Elder, that I will never forget my feelings for him in this lifetime. I only hope that he can forget me completely, reducing my sins. I also hope that he will strive for progress to comfort you in your old age, and I will be spared the reputation of a heartless woman. I will never correspond with Zhu Zhai. Although I miss him to the extreme, I will not write a single word to him to cause him distress. Now, to dispel the boredom in my heart, I indulge in a romantic life all day long. Outsiders do not know and think I am living happily and successfully, but who knows that I have a knot in my heart that cannot be erased, and the deeper the days go, the more painful it becomes? I should not have told you these things, Elder, but apart from you, I cannot tell anyone my suffering. Please forgive me, Elder, and I wish you good fortune! Qi Wan respectfully." After reading this letter, Zhu Zhai stood foolishly under the peach tree, staring at the peach blossoms, without saying a word. Xiao Bai patted him on the shoulder and said, "Zhu Zhai, you should also work hard so as not to let her suffer in vain. What she said in the letter is entirely meant to urge you to improve. You must understand her intention." Zhu Zhai came to his senses after being patted by Xiao Bai and asked, "Uncle, can I see the letter she wrote to you?"</p>
<h3>Discussing Lu Zhengxiang (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qingxue Academy</p>
<p>Furthermore, observing the detailed records of his negotiations with Hioki Eki each time (see Wang Yunsheng's "Sixty Years of China and Japan," section on Twenty-One Demands), totaling tens of thousands of words, filled with rivalry and exhausting arguments, prioritizing matters and responding flexibly, his meticulousness and talent were beyond the reach of mediocre individuals. (Although Vice Minister Cao also attended, he could only occasionally contribute a few words, directing his attention to Obata, the counselor accompanying the other side.) Since he handled the treaty single-handedly, it is possible to call him the "leader" of "traitors." According to normal theory, Lu's merits and demerits seem to be a great contradiction. However, examining the evolution of history, Lu's two major actions before and after taking responsibility were actually contradictory yet complementary. Without this, it would not have been possible to guide the revolution against the powerful neighbor after their modernization, leading to its downfall. (The relationship involved is a long story, which cannot be elaborated here; but those who recognize the times can easily understand that the "driving force" of revolutionary diplomacy is like the mutual use of positive and negative electricity.)</p>
<p>"Merit" or "demerit," "loyalty" or "treachery," Lu Zhengxiang has given up everything. Yet, he has neither departed from this world nor become a devout Buddhist, but instead went to the St. Benedictine Abbey in Belgium for ascetic cultivation and practice. From 1927 (the 16th year of the Republic) to the present (1948), it has been a full twenty years, with no news. During World War II, Hitler ravaged all of Europe, and Belgium was the first to bear the brunt, with constant artillery fire and immense suffering. It is hard to imagine Lu's survival. However, miraculously, in August of 1946, a year after the end of the war, European news reported that the old man had been specially awarded by the Pope for his accomplishments in spiritual practice and appointed as the abbot of the St. Peter's Abbey in Ghent. He took office in Belgium on July 10, and priests from various countries gathered to pay their respects. Not only was he unharmed, but his spiritual practice was unusually complete. This is not only beyond the imagination of the Chinese elite, but also a rare miracle among famous people worldwide.</p>
<p>The spiritual practice in monasteries is genuine and arduous, with strict precepts and a unity of knowledge and action. The first year is for trial study, the second year for receiving a saint's name and performing the "washing of feet" ceremony; the fourth year for being ordained as a priest and making vows, totaling three great vows: (1) "Poverty" (Paunxete), (2) "Chastity" (Chastete), and (3) "Obedience" (Oberssonce). Lu observed them all, consistently for more than ten years. The monks of various countries in the monastery are completely equal and mutually helpful, without national boundaries, racial boundaries, class distinctions, or prejudices, truly a model of the world's people. Lu, a man of great fame, position, wealth, and honor, concealed his tracks and practiced in seclusion, from his prime to old age, consistently. According to the sacred records of Sakyamuni Buddha, a prince of a king saw through the vanity of the world, abandoned wealth and honor, and achieved enlightenment, becoming an extraordinary and outstanding person. However, that was an ancient event, only seen in records, whereas Lu is a real person existing in modern times, truly rare and valuable.</p>
<p>Lu was a man full of emotion. The death of his beloved wife (of Belgian nationality) grieved him deeply, which was also one of the reasons for his monastic life. However, he cherished his mentors (Xu Wensu Jingcheng) and friends throughout his life. Such virtue and friendship are rare in the world!</p>
