<h3>論衛生</h3>
<p>— 周尚</p>
<p>為上海市衛生展覽作</p>
<p>一年容易勿又秋風。當此金風送　之秋，衛生一道　宣注意，人們對秋令衛生往往忽略，宣則秋令衛生的重要圖不亞於令，請瞧病人秋季多過夏季，便是一種證明何况　疾常　於秋間，所謂「夏秋癮」即懸性　，　人昔稱之日　氣，死亡枕　。霍亂·痢疾·傷寒等等，亦多見於。盡秋來。這次上海市衛生局明天（二十日〕舉辦的衛生展，大家應有覽警惕。</p>
<p>蔣總統此次發起勤儉　運動，所定的踐要目中，提倡動勞方面齣第三條，爲推進國民健康運動，因爲健康的體魄是力量的源泉。惟其如此，我們必須更重衛生，以配合這一個勤儉建羅運動，</p>
<p>論及中國衛生，每令人起一種强烈的時代感觸，要於抑也不成，心潮泛濫了革頃波濤的感慨。本來中國一切不如人，而衛生更不如人；不如人的結果，在精神上表演的是自私自利，在物質上呈現的是貧窮困苦，因為不講衛生，疾病率特別高，高到平均每天有一千六百萬人在生病！因為不講衛生，死亡率特別驚人，驚人得每年枉死的人比一個上海市全市人口還要多！人家平均壽命已超出了六十歲，我們停留在三十歲！人家的傷寒，霍亂，痢疾等病幾將成為歷史上齣名詞，而我們還在年年流行，我們憑什麼來估量這損失？這種損失拿什麼來贖回？</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，敵人撤退了。如果我們所期待着去肩負那復興大業的人，非神經變態，即智　低下，不是人格墮落，便是三　九痛，試問那偶以千百萬問　齣赤血澆出來的勝利之花，將在那裏開放？文化火炬將藉何人去傳授？一切一切的事業，豈是那身心不健全的人們所能負擔？一個衰弱的腦筋，裝在一個衰弱的身體之上，乃是行尸走肉。我們民族中不乏有安迪生的智力，却沒有安迪生的身體；有安迪生身體齣，却又沒有安迪生的智力。因此，迄今發現不出一個中國齣安迪生！</p>
<p>衛生是達到健康的一條途徑，我國古時看得特別重要。衛生二字早見於先秦時代。莊子記載着南榮趙問老子一段話：『若趙之聞大道，醫猶欲藥以加病也，趙願聞衛生之經而已矣。』炎黃兩帝都是衛生家，站在衛生學原理上建立起民族思想。孫中山先生說，我們國家政治的目的是『保養』兩字。可見有遠大眼光的政治家一定提倡衛生，因為衛生是民族的生物基礎</p>
<p>民族是生物的，國家是政治的，朱有生物基礎惡劣而政治能够淸明，目前大家在要求政治澄淸而未聞從生物基礎上着想，這是舍本逐末，綠木而求魚。衛生之於人民，猶魚之與水，得之則生，失之則死，對人民然，對國家亦然。史家稱希臘羅馬之亡，亡於幾個　蚊。巴拿馬運河先後的成敗，何嘗不是為了衛生問題？衛生是現代化過程裏一個頂重要部分，他是為民族生物樹立基礎。一個不理會生物基礎的民族，一個但知利用生物本錢而不知自覺的與自動的來增加這種本錢的民族，是異常的危險。一個國家但知醫晨畜牧之利而研習生物學，不知為一民族目身內在的健康而研習生物學，也是十分漢見，並且遲早要食淺見之果。</p>
<p>近數年來，大家只曉得口頭和人家爭所謂四强之一，五大之一，而於如何提高民族一般品質以取得身强體大以至於超越　別人的地位，則元全不問，豈不是大可『哀哉』之事！目前我們每分鐘就在用我們老祖遺傳給我們民族的生物本錢，大家只曉得就祖宗遺留下來的本錢儘量用，總有一天會油乾燈軍盡，假使再不倡導衛生，推行衛生，我看這個油乾燈草盡的末日，降臨之期不見得遙遠。請有我們二次參加世界運動會的『全軍覆沒』，再看人家開戰車能維持六小時，而我們二小時也十分吃力；這豈不是民族淘汰的預兆？</p>
<p>軍事失敗可致亡國，衛生不講可致滅種。大家不要以衛生事小而輕輕放過，要知一切事都在隱徵之間顯現出來。上海市衛生局張局長有鑒於此，用盡力量提倡衛生，這次在萬般困難中舉行衛生展覽，其用意之深，用心之苦，凡我市民當宜體察而躬行。衛生不在多言而在實踐，衛生習慣重於衛生智識，市民們瞧到展覽後應卽有所覺悟。要知衛生不單為個人事，且為子孫事，更為整個民族國家事，不能不用大力量來發揚光大，庶不負這次展覽的意義？</p>
<p>衛生不一定費錢，有時還可省錢。衛生決不是浪費；相反的，衛生是頂經濟的。有時為了衛生不免須投資，但這種投資是頂賢明的投資。波毛意敎授（L.Bomer）云，「一道溝渠之於鄉村，其對鄉村之利益，可與國家之開關巴拿馬或　　土運河相比擬。』英國四百人以上的集房社會卽有健康建設。蘇聯初期建設經費，亦以衛生居首要·日光景補品，取之不畫，用之不竭，日光浴可使業外綫照射皮下脂肪使體內自製丁稱維生素，以資身體吸收鈣質。這不是不獨不費錢而且省統，免得　買魚肝油　營養品。糙未比白米有價僅，這豈不又節省了金錢嗎？再如睡眠充足，身體勤洗，這難道也要實錢嗎？少吃一匣香烟，多喝幾碗豆腐榮，這難道作不到嗎？</p>
<p>講究個八衛生，又須隨時注意到社會與公眾齣安全。個人衛生與公共衛生原是一件事，人人能講自我，社會全般當然也會衛生起來。楊子為我的哲學，究其極，也未嘗不為社會打稱。中國人自私自利畸形發迷，所以一樣提偶個人衛生，在別國比較可以同時收公共衛生的效果，而在中國則否。在「各人自掃門前雪」自私自利心驅策之下，很容易演成種種「損人利巳』而終於「損人不利己」。請瞧藥渣滿地，再看『出雙重傷風，一見就成功』；這是什麼心理？號稱文明人，對於隨地吐痰似乎是好些了，但家裏不吐，街上和公共場所照樣吐，當人面不吐，背了人還是吐；這是什麼道理？</p>
<p>衛生是一種戰爭，全世界所有的國家都該參加衛生的敵人有時為一個細菌，有時為一只蝨蚤，有時為一頭蒼蠅或蚊蟲，一頭犬或一只老鼠，有時為一種無生物的化學物質，有時為人類腦或手齣產物，有時都為我們自己。這裏應該從自己戰鬥起！我們為衛生，為健康，應聯合全市全國全人類作共同的戰鬥。這是影響我們每個人乃至國家民族與全人類的生命和幸福。這戰鬥每個人該參加一部份。</p>

<h3>監委調查徐陶案報告書</h3>
<p>（續昨）三，就稽查場內交易帳目及場外交易所得可疑之綫索，卽請由上海市警察局依法傳訊，分別情節輕重，予以交保或拘押，併案送請上海地方法院或特種刑事法庭處理。四，賣成財政，工商兩部派駐上海證券交易所監理員王　堂，沈雲龍等供據各經紀人八月十七日至十九日表報之交易數額，在三百萬股以上之帳目，逐戶詳查報核，根據上述步驟，分別進行之結果，查得賣出永紗股票數額在三百萬股以上及有場外交易　疑之各經濟人，計五五號，八五號，九五號，二二四號，二三五號，二〇四號，一五〇號，六五號，一三五號，四號，一九〇號，一二九號，七六號，七一號，一六號，二八號，二三七號，二一三號，一四五號，八九號，一二號，二號等廿二戶。其中（一）承認有場外交易者，為一九〇號證券號林樂畊一戶，據稱：於八月十六日，買進二三七號經紀人社維屛永紗股票一千六百萬股。（二）有場外交易之嫌疑者，有八五號介昌證券號，外傳該號交易甚多，而帳載甚簡。一四五號立豐證券號，帳上交易甚少，而銀錢往來甚多及第二號永成證券號介入錢莊票據未明說明來源等家。（三）場內交易，以七十六號經紀人生興證券號賣出一千一百九十萬股為最多，其中以客戶靡畊記四百萬股為最巨，二一三號經紀人祥大證券號之客戶泰記，魏將庭三百萬股次之，其他二百萬股以上者甚少，在一百萬股以上者亦不多見。</p>
<p>傳訊多人</p>
<p>根據以上檢查結果，乃通知警察局於九月五日上午，傳訊杜維屛，據供稱：於八月十一日至十六日，共賣與林樂畊永紗股票一千六百萬股，十九日拋給天裕五百萬股，振昌三百萬股，茂德四百萬股，並謂：十九日日上午九時，有客戶李伯勤偕同婦女二人，共同拋出永紗六百萬股（後據陶李國蘭供共賣出七百多萬股），分別以「蘭記」，「淑記」開戶。事後並聞李伯勤對他人宣稱：已先獲得改革幣制消息等情，委員等根據是項綫索，卽請由警察局票傳李伯勤及該二婦女到局應訊。惟李伯勤禾獲，僅拘到以「蘭記」開戶之李國蘭及以「淑記」開戶之楊淑瑤，分別審訊，據李國蘭供稱：其夫名陶啓明，現任財政部秘書，兼資料室主任，曾於八月十八日晚由京來滬，十九日夜車返京，當承認於十九日晨在華美號拋出永紗二百萬股，其兄李伯勤拋出三百萬股。又據楊淑瑤供稱：其夫徐壯懷，現任南京中國石油公司主任秘書，承認於十九日晨偕李國蘭問往藉美拋出永紗二百萬股，案情至此，始得臘目。委員等以陶啓明之嫌疑重大，乃卽時請由上海金管局長林崇墉，負責電告財政部長王雲五，請其將陶啓明迅卽扣押，以便作進一步之調查，併請林局長轉告王部長，在案情未判明以前，除在滬嚴守秘密外，在京亦暫勿發表任何消息，以免有關人犯聞風逃避。旋據林局長先後告稱：巳徵得王部長同意，在京暫不發表新聞，，並於當晚已將陶啓明扣押。</p>
<p>拘訊陶徐</p>
<p>委員等為爭取時間，澈底追究計，除就在滬調查所得情形及結果，提出意見，兩請上海市警察局繼續偵辦，並函請蔣特派員經國，林局長崇墉，予以督導及協助外，乃於九月四日淸晨返抵首都，訪晤警察廳黃廳長，並至刑警隊會同警應主辦人員偵訊陶啓明。經兩白審問，陶始承認於八月十八日上午十一時至十二時之間，由財部主任秘書徐百齊差遣工友，請至徐之辦公室，密告渠所草擬之行莊及交易所暫停營業之消息，囑其卽日赴滬，轉告袁仰安，其赴滬之交通工具，亦經商得其同意，搭乘飛機。旋陶復與徐壯懷商酌，認為大可利用此一消息，投機牟利，徐並托陶轉邀其妻楊淑瑤，在滬共同行事，於是徐壯懷乃代陶啓明購買中航公司由京至滬之飛機票，於當日下午六時飛滬，卽遵徐百齊之囑，將此消息轉告袁仰安，復於十九日晨由其妻李國蘭，邀同其兄李伯勤及楊淑瑤，前往華美公司分別拋售永紗股票空股，依據此項口供，藉知財政部主任秘書徐百齊及中國石油公司主任秘書徐壯懷，在滬執行律師業務之袁仰安，涉有洩漏國家機密及利用此一機密消息，有所企圖之重大嫌疑，因卽通知首都警察　黃廳長，請其分別拘訊徐百齊，徐壯懷，袁仰安等，惟徐壯懷已於九月三日王部長發表公開談話之當晚，乘車離京去滬，委員等除請首都警察　派員至滬會同上海警察局嚴密緝拿，並傳訊袁仰安外，徐百齊當於九月五日晚問，由警廳拘押到案。詎徐早有準備，對於洩漏機密，規避甚力，幾經曉論，始和盤托出，雖其所供興陶啓明略有出入，然證之於陶啓明，袁仰安先後所供，其故意洩露國家機密，有所企圖，實毫無疑義。</p>
<p>兩人在逃</p>
<p>九月七日袁仰安由滬傳到，據供，其得知此項消息之內容與經過情形，與陶啓明所供各節，完元全相符，惟堅不承認有任何拋空牟利情事，此點是否屬實，似仍應繼續查究，因亦由警廳併案移送首都特種刑事法庭處理，查本案除徐壯懷·李伯勤聞風逃逸，無由偵悉其洩露國家機密投機牟利之詳細情形與影響外，所有其餘主從各犯犯罪行為之調查工作，至此告一段落。（下接第四版）</p>

<h3>節省公物公帑　一掃已場積習　糧食購儲會新作風　被譽勤儉運動有率</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕記者所接觸之上海各級政府機構主管人員，其生活工作確能切符勤儉建國運動之精神者糧食部糧食緊急購儲會主任楊氏綽，可為代表矣。該會內部一切設施，記者認為足堪為全國公務機關及公務員之表率。該會無一衛兵無一傳達，甚且無一工友，會內公文之傳遞，公事之洽辦，俱由各人親自為之；在辦公時間，全體職負除埋首工作外，一槪禁止喝茶，看報，吃烟，談天，該會四時遍縣表格，自楊氏起，經常親自填寫，會務情形，一目瞭然。對公物公，極盡節省之能事，一切文件之面積，均縮减至最小限度，其使用尤力求構節，記老曾在楊氏辦公桌內發現渠所收集廢棄公文紙及以使用過之信封翻製而成之信封各一壘，足證渠對　物亦予利用。楊氏對勸儉兩事，可謂身體力行。記者詢渠對推行勤儉建國運動之意見時，渠指出「避免浪費及凡事求合理化，為國人所應努力之最低日標」渠稱：目前中國之物力誠極艱難，但如國人均能力避浪費，仍有餘裕。我國現一面仰賴國外糧食之接濟，一面却容許茶樓酒館日日客滿，實為最不合理之現象，余每次赴宴時，余之內心，深感痛苦。渠處事之力求合理，可從下列兩事可以證明：公文之內容及彭式已率先改革；該會職員辦公座位，每人面積不超過二，五平方公尺。楊氏與全體職員相處一室，使用同樣之桌椅，佔有同等之面積，渠對此事之解釋，請渠之目的非為做官，而係為國家訓練幹部人才，故須以身作則，如此乃可使上下精神不至脫節。楊氏之親友曾迭函促渠放棄窮公務負生活，返鄉經商，但渠認為為國服務，應當刻苦儉約，個人利益，不必計較。楊氏在擔任該會主任前，歷任贛省建般廳長，渝市府秘書長，哈爾濱市長。　楊綽庵身體力行舊信封翻製使用</p>

<h3>前周逆佛海滬寓　巨刼案破獲　名貴飾物估價敗露　先後擒獲男女四犯　供出內綫為被歇女僕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本年六月廿六日晚，湖南路三二四號（卽居爾典路）卽前周逆佛海之滬寓曾發生盜刦案，計被刦珠鑽等名貴飾物，價值極鉅。事後經被害人容梁實惠報告該管常熟警分局轉報總局偵緝科，當由哪科長派股長馮起山等着手偵查，歷時二月餘，終告破案，並吊出大批贓物，目前除繼續追緝在逃共犯外，對已捕獲之男女盜犯四名，已向地檢處申請延畏羈押，俾便詳寗偵查是否尚犯有其他案件。據記者獲悉：此案發生後，警員等曾煞費苦心，惟因盜犯亦機警異常，卽在搶刦時雖歷時甚久，而在現場竟絲臺未留指紋痕跡，事後，復因曾刦得美鈔千元之故，對贓物部份竟未加動用變費，因之所佈之綫索網竟</p>
<p>一無發展。直至本月十六日，膨科長始獲密報，謂有人持名貴翡翠珠項鍊一條（贓物之一），在大新街春華樓公開給予珠玉同業觀看估價，當卽飭馮股長督率承辦員警錢大圻，張景玉，張雲明，丁兆淦等前往追查該物來源，結果得悉該項鍊係中正中路三九七號同昌珠寶店店主馬受百所有，員警等乃化裝珠寶商設計將馬拘獲，據供稱，此項鍊並非已有，實係住長寗路仁和里五號勵仁社理事長楊振華請託代售，經再將楊傳科，始供出係社昌張雲亭之物，乃由楊引領至虹橋路東塘子涇一號將張拘獲，當場並抄獲寶石金戒一只，經帶案偵訊後，供認曾結夥</p>

<h3>監委調查徐陶案報告書　（上文接第二版）</h3>
<p>（二）本案真相</p>
<p>基於上述實地調查所得，本案傎相，計有下列各點：一，國家機密洩露之內容，為財政部八月十八日草擬十九日發布之「銀行錢莊及交易听暫停營業」之命令。二，此一機密而甫要之文稿，係由財政部徐次長，商承王部長之同意，於八月十八日上午十一時至十二時之間，在徐次長辦公室內口授意旨，交由該部主任秘書徐百齊所草擬。三，徐百齊於草擬此項命令完畢退出之後，將此機密命令之內容告知秘書陶啓明，囑其即日赴滬，轉告袁仰安。四，陶啓明獲知此項機密消息後，即與資源委負會南京中國石油公司主任秘徐壯懷會商，由徐壯懷代陶啓明購買當日飛機票，於下午六時乘中航機由京去滬，徐並託陶轉告其妻楊淑瑤，共同參與拋空牟利行為。五，陶啓明於當晚八時抵滬後，即興其妻商議投機事宜，並用電話約晤　仰安，袁適外出，旋接袁電話，乃於當晚十時趕往　處，轉遠徐百齊之機密消息。</p>
<p>立戶拋空</p>
<p>六，陶啓明之妻李國蘭，於人月十九日上午九時許，邀同徐楊淑瑤，李伯勸相偕至杜維屛所經營之華美公司，由李伯勤之介紹，分立「　記」「淑記」戶頭，拋售永紗股票空股七百餘萬股，李國蘭二百萬股，楊淑瑤二百萬股，李伯勤三百餘萬股，李國蘭過去雖曾經營股票交易，然自台灣返滬後，據稱：此尚係第一次。七，李伯勤在華夫拋空後，聲言已獲知幣制改革消息，當日證券市場跌落甚巨，是否由彼散布消息而起，以拘傳未獲，尚待偵查。八，徐壯懷得知機密後，是否將此消息散布於他人，使其利用之，以為投機牟利之行為，以拘傳未到，尚待偵查。九，袁仰安得此悄息後，在八月十九日有無利用之以為投機牟利，尚未判明。倘果有此等情事，則是否與徐百齊相互串通’亦待查考。十，杜維屛除為法令證券經紀人之外，復設華美公司非合法證券號經營場外交易，實為法所不許，渠於華美及其十三七號證券號於八月十九日拋情水紗空股一千二百萬股，是否即係由李伯勤告知是項消息而作，以李伯勤在逃，無法證實。</p>
<p>凟職誤公</p>
<p>根據以上事實之分析，得知本案之發生，實由於財政部主任秘書徐百齊故意洩露重要機密，有所企予而起，不論該犯有無投機牟利之事實，其洩露機密，破壞政府財經緊念措施，危害國家之罪行，亟應依法嚴懲，以昭烔戒。該部秘書陶啓明，利用機密，投機牟利，於法已屬不合，况復傳播消息，惹動風潮，知法犯法，亦屬罪無可逭。資源委員會南京石油公司主任秘書徐壯赤與陶啓明利用機密消息，夥同牟利，顯為觸犯刑章。又財政部派駐上海證券交易所監理員王　堂，與工商部派駐該所之監理員深雲龍，職在監督檢查交易場所，有無非法交易行為，事先旣未盡其監督職責，事後經委員導責成其嚴密檢查，又未據其將各運法交易之情事切實查復，實屬有　職守，財政部部長　雲五信用親信，疏於考察，致使國家重要　密輕易洩露，亦難辭用人失察，怠忽職守之咎·以上各員，或為行政首長，或為重要員司，當茲憲政實施，與財經改革切實推行之際，應如何公忠體國，慎重將事，乃竟失職　職，貽誤要公，殊屬不合已極，亟應分別情節輕重，從嚴懲處，至李國蘭，楊淑瑤，杜維屏等，或利用機密，投機牟利，或私設字號，違法交易，均應按其情節依法懲辦。李伯勤，徐壯懷二犯，仍應資成司法機關緝拿歸案，以伸法紀。</p>
<p>整肅官箴</p>
<p>總之，在此國步難難，政府力圖革新之際，任何作奸犯科之行為，均為法紀所不容，本院職司監察，當茲舉世矚目之下，自應有所舉措，以肅官　，而平民情。委員等除將全部案件及人犯請由京。滬兩地警察機關移送繼續偵查，依法處理外，合將調查本案經過，通同附件，報請鑿核，此上院長于，附有關附件，共十一號及附件目錄表一份，委員唐鴻烈，，孫王琳，九月二二日。（完）</p>

<h3>西今奇鳳　天堂潮</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十七日快訊〕這幾天來，西子湖濱正是秋高氣爽的時候，那晶瑩明亮的月，照澈了湖面，堤邊的楊柳，垂着頭向那綠茵輕輕地私語。遊人　着划子，浴在明如白晝的月光下，槳，割破了靜寂，駛向馥郁的深處。記者曾經為文預測過，今年杭州的秋汎，將是空前的熟鬧。自從九月十二日起，杭州各家大小旅館都已完全客滿了。有幾家大旅館，正設計商借別　山莊，來作為招待賓客的營業。菜館酒樓是是　軋堪，後至的人祇好竚候上一桌吃好後再補上，三輪車黃包軍完全以金圓券要價，起碼要三角，從城站到湖濱索價二元，划子雇一條，要十塊金圓，近日來划子早被澦定一空，我看後來的人，只好仍和春汎時一樣租澡堂，汽車，咖啡館，作為他們臨時的寓邸了。</p>
<p>游資無法路</p>
<p>立法委員諶小岑氏對記者談：「今年杭州齣秋汎傎是空前了，大半是因為上海的游資沒有出處，做黃金美鈔，棉紗等等的人，覺得沒有辦法做，落得到杭州來玩玩。一是的，物價平穩，投機賣買齣人感覺苦悶而來杭州散心的大有人在，但因着物價平穩，可以多玩幾天，也是事實。今年秋凉來得很早，而且海寗的潮特別大，這都是使杭州成為時代的寵兒的原因</p>
<p>十八看夜潮</p>
<p>塘工局副局長兼總工程師汪胡楨氏告訴記者：「今年的潮，傎是很大的。」塘工局原本努力經營的禦潮工程，正待逐漸完成的時候，不意大自然又將江流變道，海髯外面的漲沙坍了，汹湧澎湃的浪潮又來了。七堡外面齣漲灘耕地都彼冲捲浸濕了，千百居民都受到生活的威脅。王東原氏去看潮，吉普車被推倒在塘後的田內，據說那一次的潮，高出塘岸丈餘，聲如山崩海嘯。汪胡楨氏曾以科學的分析告訴記者：「潮汎往往決定於月球的移轉，良以逢月圓的時候潮會大起來，中國　曆是決定於封建時代的欽天鑑所製定的。民國以來，改用新曆，自然的轉移，現在的　曆十五，應該落在十六。十五就是十四。那麼十六以後到十九幾天內都有大灣，惟以現在的十八晚十九晨一二時齣潮更大。」所以來杭州遊覽順便要去看潮的朋友，應該看十八日的夜潮，潮；可以看到它奔騰着千軍萬馬的壯偉姿式，使你心雄萬夫，從而增强生命的力量。</p>
<p>美女女與英雄</p>
<p>為了潮，許多要人都聚集杭州，順道去海寗看潮，李宗仁副總　統來了，前浙主席黃紹竑來了，賀耀祖來了，朱家　部長來了，何應欽部長要來了，美國巴達維亞也要來了，他們優遊於杭州柔麗的湖光山巴之餘，復去看那雄偉的浪潮，兩種大自然的造化，却換來了兩種欣賞的心情·一面是溫柔美麗的姑娘，一面是放浪組獷的勇漢，但這美麗的姑娘與粗獷的英雄也是千千萬萬人民齣辛苦所培養成功的。</p>
<p>風雨秋收歉</p>
<p>今年那江有五十一縣報風雨之災，當然影響了秋收，而湖南穀倉，又因為大水災以致禁米出口，江西因為湖南無米出口，所以也禁米外運，在這樣的情形下，素以缺糧著稱的浙江民食，當然不免有相當的問題，而農田很少，生產不多的杭州市，更會受着極大的威脅。　今年杭州的狄汎，不但熟鬧，而且很長，或將拖到秋盡冬來吧</p>

<p>關於行莊存放款利率調整事，頃據上海金融管理局負責人語記者稱：該局在政府公布銀行錢莊存放利率限制辦法後，即逝案令飭本市銀錢信託三業公會，轉行各行莊公司遵照，自九月一日起抑低一角以內，九月十六日起，利率抑低月息五分以內。但商業行莊公司認為若依時限將利率作硬性之壓低，恐易影饗市場，巳遵令於九月一日至十五日止，將利率由月息一角二分陸續遞减至七分五釐，自十六日起再减至六分六釐，仍於最短期間續减至月息五分以內，以符功令。該局以事實所在，不無可原，巳據情報部核示。至省市銀行情形較為不同，該局業巳分別令知，自即（十八）日起，放款利率减低至五分以內云。</p>
<h3>行局差出增多</h3>
<p>昨日銀根仍鬆，國家行局共差出三百七十一萬元，內中央銀行差出二九三萬元，中國銀行差出五〇萬一元，交通銀行差進三十九萬元，農民銀行差出八十七萬元，中信局差出六十四萬元，郵匯局差進一〇三萬元，中央合作金庫十九萬元，外商銀行差進四十五萬元。大交換差進四十八萬元，小交換差進二七八萬元。</p>
<h3>上海區　一月內收進法幣已達一六〇萬億</h3>
<p>幣制改革迄今恰滿匝月，此一月中，中央銀行曁各委託銀行大量收兌金銀外幣，並收進法幣，據悉迄昨日為止，上海區全部收進之法幣，約略統計，巳近一百六十萬億，（折合金圓券五千餘萬元），致市上流通法幣巳大减。外埠各地收進數字，亦相當可觀，惟遠較本市為少。至巳收進之法幣，將來作何處置，當局尚在考慮中。可能於收兌期滿後，集中焚化，或作造紙原料云。</p>
<h3>陳長桐談　僑匯情形好轉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行國外部經理陳長桐近自美返國，據稱；自我國改革幣制後，僑匯情形已見好轉，僅菲律賓一地，自上月二十日至本月十五日為止，匯回祖國之款項，巳達一百萬美元以上；而在改革以前，每週僑匯收入僅一千餘美元。只需國內物價繼續穩定，則今後僑匯收入勢必增加。</p>
<h3>食火上落微細雨　限價提高麺粉俏升</h3>
<p>米市盤旋，市勢上落甚微，初開略見喊高，但因去路依然呆木，旋即回疲，終為平定之象。到貨仍少，本街銷胃平常，交易平淡。南市場白粳二十元零六角，薄稻站住二十一元五角之限價。北市場高薄稻减低二角，下檔貨略見提升二角至三角，高貨平定，昨日到貨南北二市共計二六五三石。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>挺升，因二號粉限價改為捉高至七元六角二分（廠盤），零售提高為七元八角，故人心轉活，價再挺升，而其漲勢殊力。老車粉未有開出，兵船粉七元四角七分，計升二角二分。其他雜牌粉一致升一角二三分，麩皮按限價五元三角三分開出。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>堅秀，黃豆有洋莊抵補，故高貨市堅。車豆價格十二元三角三分，惟中貨乍豆十元成交，市稱平定。苞米北幫去化活絡，略秀一角，紅糧客　光顧，交易暢旺，價升二角。元　開價平定，芝蔴洋莊有胃，市勢趨堅，生仁亦有洋莊去路，徐州及開封各以限價開出。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>因出境許可辦法暫緩實施，致人心又虛。貨主扳特乏力，價乃下降，豆油僅大統按四十八元開出，餘為現貨交易最低四十七元，下降一元·生菜油削一多，生油降五角，凈生油五十八元五角，熟菜油猛挫二元五角，小軍蔴油亦降二元五角。豆餅廠盤平定。</p>
<h3>祁紅成交不多</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，祁門將軍橋合作社日前　滬之紅茶，英商怡和，協和雨洋行，雖曾趨前與賣方磋商，但出價每担僅在一百八九十元間，而持貨者因成本高昂，一時不忍割愛，致交易續居擯持。其他花色，亦以吐納各自喊價，成交不多，市氣則均穩固。至於內銷茶，供求相埒，起伏式　。</p>
<p>頃悉：中秋節前，產區屯溪茶商來滬，談及彼地茶市，在各方買氣濃郁中，早呈求過於供之象，加以目前產茶季業巳消逝，故存貨趨枯，是以市價逐見晋升，綜觀此種情形，如仍任其上砌，對本市茶銷，漸難樂觀。</p>
<h3>民營紗廠產銷會　昨開代表會議</h3>
<p>浙　京滬區棉紡公會民營紗廠同業，為　行政府經濟施策，　　民業間產銷之聯緊起見，特激動組蘇浙皖京滬區民營紗廠　合　　委員會，於昨日（十八日）下午三時半，舉行民營紗　代表會議。出席代表劉靖基。汪竹一·　敎堂·王子建·　不基等七十餘人，首由常務理事靖基主席致詞，秘書長汪竹一報告最近會務，擇卽討論聯合產銷　員會組織章程，修正通過。並推定劉靖基·榮爾仁·郭棣活·唐星海，榮一心·王子建·吳昆生·劉國鈞。韓志明·張文潛·童瀾夫·邵寶虎·郭琼·榮廣亮·唐君遠·靜祖恒·嚴欣淇·吳漱英·董春芳·王統元·王雲程等二十一人為委員，</p>
<h3>紗市人心萎頓　棉布外銷不動吐售者多</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因當局對物資出境辦法暫緩施行，人心頓轉萎靡，客帮停止添購，本街去化亦稀，市氣逐告挫頓。場內細紗籌碼不充，而有複製業頻來搜購，四十二支金城及卅二支銀月等細紗，市勢穩中帶俏。廿一支雙馬低見七百四十五元，嗣以逢小有進，最後略見回蘇，但結果比節前軋跌十八元。二十支以下各紗，供應充沛，走勢亦佳，市氣平穩，成交五百八十六件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布因出口辦法暫緩實行，外銷不動，客帮止進反出，且當局抽查賬册棧單倉庫等，工作頗為嚴　。又因紡建公司多以高檔貨開售，供源不寂，籌碼充斥，市上各方賣意轉濃，貨主心怯，紛來吐售。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開僅小四角，嗣以號家及染廠不納，行情再小至廿七元五角站住，較之節前勁挫九角之鉅。全日趨勢，以四君子元嗶嘰當令銷旺，求者甚多，只小二角五分。其他各布回低三·四·五角不一，惟色布及士林布，仍惟原盤，成交一千一百八十疋。</p>
<h3>配合內外市場需要　出口限價酌予提高</h3>
<p>輸管會公佈施行之出口限價，原係根據各出口貨之國外市場實際情况訂定。據悉：該處下週（九月廿日至廿六日）巳將本年度祁門紅茶芝蔴餅等最低價格酌予提高。此外幷增列專銷澳洲蓆草帽生仁餅及五號新祁紅等之最低出口價格。其餘豬鬃皮統。毛皮·羊毛·髮毛·羽毛·草帽·茶葉（新祁紅除外）腸衣等項，則均無變更。上項經增訂後之貨品出口，最低F·O·B美金價格如次：蓆帽（銷澳洲）每打三角五分，芝蔴餅每長噸六十五元，花生仁餅每長噸六十五元，頭號新祁紅每磅四角，二號新祁紅每磅三角，三號新祁紅每磅二角五分，四號新祁紅每磅一角八分，五號新祁紅每磅一角四分。</p>
<h3>大量紗布即將南運</h3>
<p>自紗布禁止出境後，一向賴滬支持之華南各地紗布需量頓减，現供不應求，頗感缺乏，是以售價激看，影響民心。奧當局前特致電中紡公司，要求該公司趕運布二十萬疋，紗二千件赴穗，以應急需。該公司得電後，卽將此情形，呈請蔣督導員核准，原則上大致無問題，惟因避免刺激滬上平靜之物價計，中紡巳事先計劃週密，現正與有關各方而接洽起運中。至於首批運出之數量多寡，將視接洽後之船隻噸位而定。</p>

<h3>王正廷在美　談亞洲運動會　日簽訂和約後歡迎參加　首屆亞運不欲在華舉行</h3>

<h3>老婆的可怕</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>敎員休息室裏添覺了幾把藤椅。這是學校當局的好意，知道下了課的敎員總是口乾疲倦，坐在　背椅上，喝杯開水，舒適一下，可以恢復起精神來。有了這些椅子，室內煥然一新，也就使人喜歡。本來要隨時去照料的敎學組長固然常常進去，採辦這此器具的庶務也時常去坐一下。上課時間，敎員都在課室裏，這時敎學組長和庶務不期而遇，就一通坐在那里閒談。</p>
<p>「前門牌的香烟，」庶務吸了口烟捏着烟蒂頭說，「這兩天倒有便宜的可買；據說是沒收來齣囤貨，囤積着不肯出賣，給警察查到，就沒收，在平價拍賣。可惜水還是沒有發下來，不能去買幾條。其實呢，只要能够買一條也好。</p>
<p>烟蒂頭經很短，快要燒到捏着的手指頭，似乎就想擲掉。可是順眼一瞥，覺得還能勉强撮一下，　攏手去，他又用勁深深的吸了口，這才迅速的斜拋在疲孟裏，發出嗤的一聲。</p>
<p>「新水還是毫無消息，」敎學組長應和，一香烟倒還是小事情；我，兩個孩子要去註册，限期已經到了，傎不知道要怎樣才好。為着孩子的學費，照例一到假期就盡力節省。可是積受不多，有了雜費，還缺少米。一百八十斤一個，三百六十斤，就要一億半，滿希望上月份的薪水能够按時發下來。</p>
<p>一每次調整，薪水照例要遲發，因為表册要轉來轉去的核定。調整以前物價總是狂漲的，大家用完了錢等薪水；薪水偏偏要遲發。這次是改換金圓券，而且正當各校開學的時候。</p>
<p>所以，孫主任爲着他小兄弟齣學費，弄得連戒子都巳從手指頭上脫下來去換掉了。像你，沒有在中等學校裏讀書的，可以寬些。</p>
<p>一那里　那里寬得來，小學裏繳費，也要不少呀　七元八元的金圓券，就是兩千多萬。上月份的薪水，我只拏得三千多萬；油鹽，柴米，所謂開門七件事，是天天要的。這兩天吃的香烟，是一包一包向校門口的攤子上面賒來的。錢犖不到，我就不敢回家去。哈哈！現在我是怕老婆的了。怕老婆，怕得連家裏都不敢回去了！」</p>
<p>「尊夫人是相當厲害的麼？」</p>
<p>「內人，她倒原是好說話齣。只要有了油鹽柴米，別的她都關隨使便。本來我不必使得她怕我，我也用不着怕她。現在回去可了不得；不要怎麼樣，進門去見面，只要一問薪水學到了沒有，我就怕得要命，說下去，總是米已吃完，柴要買了，油和鹽也都沒有了。對付不了，只好不回去，讓她去東借西拖。我不在家，她倒好去拖借點。但總就得還；所以日子愈多，我愈不敢回去，老婆的臉孔是愈加可怕的了。」</p>
<p>「對呀，」提到汕　柴米，沒有錢買，老婆這就可怕了，什麼　店裏欠了幾百萬，米店裏欠了幾千萬，豆腐幾百萬，　油幾百萬，也都還在店舖裏欠着。嚕哩嚕　的老遠要向我提這一套，我覺得她可怕，所以也有好些日子不回家去了。</p>
<p>一個瘦瘦的長子，架着近視限鏡，是敎史地的，忽然　了進來。敎學組長一見着就招呼，一趙先生，下一堂你有課麼？</p>
<p>「課我上午巳上了」，趙先生回對，一下午沒有了。</p>
<p>「那末怎麼還沒有　到府上去呢？」教育組長探問。</p>
<p>這一問可引出來了趙先生的牢騷，隨身坐下，也就打開了他齣話匣子。一回家，我巳經足足一個星期回不得家了，有家歸未得，為着怕看老婆的臉孔。唔！她不說話，可是她的緊　的眉頭總在那里表明：米已吃完，柴要買了。她是在等我回去解決，希望我早點回去的。剛才打聽王會計，薪水還是沒有消息，報紙翻來覆去，我找不出一點頭緒來，空手回去做什麼？」</p>
<p>苦笑着，敎學組長和庶務相互注視了一眼。</p>
<p>「以前在軍事機閱裏的時候，」趙先生接着說，「我曾經聽一個上士階級的人說，他一個月只回家去一趟，在發餉一天的晚上。因為　銀少，說是討了老婆，不能常常回家，好像到拱宸橋（註）去一樣。當時聽着只覺得可笑；現在才深深體味到了他的悲哀。」</p>
<p>「那末大家一樣，」敎育組長輕聲說，「都有着這樣的情形。」</p>
<p>「我們，」庶務伸了伸舌頭插嘴，「都是怕老婆的了！」</p>
<p>「是的，」趙先生放大聲音認傎的說，「我也是怕老婆的了；到了現在，老婆是這樣可怕的了！」</p>
<p>〔註；拱宸橋以前是商埠，公娼所在。〕</p>

<h3>三十四</h3>
<p>— 調鸚</p>
<p>這是一件實事。</p>
<p>幾年以前，美國西部某城的賭場中，走進了一個年老的賭客，他坐在輪盤賭的地方，拿出了一點籌碼，押在「三十四」上，</p>
<p>輪盤轉動了，慢慢的停下。賭場的夥計說：三十四。先生，這是你的。」他把那位老人　的錢放在輪盤上「三十四」的地方。</p>
<p>老人不動。輪盤又轉了，停下來時，又是「三十四」。賭場夥計不安地看一看那位老賭客，但是，老人還是不作聲，他的手指仍　指在「三十四」上。</p>
<p>輪盤轉動了，停了，竟然一連三次還是「三十四」。</p>
<p>那時候，許多人圍攏來看了，大家有些驚異。可是，老人還是不動聲色</p>
<p>一通五次開出來都是「三十四」。那時候，那位夥計出來打招呼了，他客氣地說「諸位先生，諸位太太小姐，我們非常抱歉，這裏要暫停了。」他面向郝位老人說：」老先生，恭喜恭喜，您的錢請收下了龍——」</p>
<p>但是他忽然大驚失色，話都說不下去了。</p>
<p>他一直到了那時候才想起，這個老人自從第一盤之後不但從未說過一句話，連動都沒有動過一動。仔細看時，那位賭國聖手竟然早已斷了氣－</p>
<h3>潤筆義話</h3>
<p>— 孝推</p>
<p>文人潤筆之例，擁容齋隨筆所載，目晋已有，至唐始盛。李北海（邕）作文，受饋贈數至鉅萬。裴度倩皇甫湜作福先寺碑，贈車馬綏繒甚多，　意尚不足，又加酬絹九千匹。白居易與元　為至交，　沒後居易為作墓志，猶受鞍馬綾帛玉帶之謝，價逾六七十萬。劉夢得昌黎文云。煙一公一字之價，　金如山。」當時鄙薄之者，謂為諛墓。宋以後此風稍殺，戒菴漫筆云：有人求文於桑民　，託以親誼，吝不予酬金，桑云：「吾平生未當白作文，可暫將白銀一錠置吾案頭，以鼓與致，待文作完，併銀當送還也。一可謂怪矣。</p>
<p>唐伯虎有一巨簿記錄為人所作文，而題「利市」二字。馬懷祖當代人求文於祝枝三，祝問：」一見精神否？一蓋吳語銀錢日「精神」也。馬答曰：「見精神。」祝始欣然提筆。陳白沙善畫，求之者戶限為穿，白沙戲題座側曰：「烏音人又來矣。」人都不解，爭問其義，陳云：「白費－白畫－」眾皆絕倒。</p>
<p>袁子才詩文非錢不出，其中年以後，肥遯嗚高，生活奢豪，經營隨園及縱情聲色之資，皆取給於生花之筆。俞曲園亦有置文例千字以內銀五十兩，過千加倍，並有詩曰：一公　碑價不買，如余識陋豈相宜？只緣竊據名山席，遂使爭求下里詞。敢以再三心厭倦，奈因七十力衰贏，學痴雖有高人笑，此意區區或諒之。一林琴南其後亦仿俞氏例訂潤格而冠以詩曰：一親舊孤　待哺多，山人無計奈他何！不增畫例謀分潤，坐聽議寒作甚麼？一此後乃蔚為風氣矣、</p>
<p>潤格詩雖各有侖意不同，大要視其人之胸襟丰度為判。然細按其氣味，殊亦無大出入，蓋文人境遇，從來難以通顯，滿腹牢騷，每好借題發揮，遇此大好機會，豈肯輕易放過。故欲於此中求得心平氣和，脫去火氣者，實不多覩。更有寸兵尺鐵勃至極，自鳴不平者，如許指齡詩；「海上蹉跎二十年，醉舒白眼坐靑天，兎毫脫盡身垂老，換得人間賣侖錢！」咄咄書空，如聞其語，如見其人‘</p>
<p>濰潭郭守　所作買文樂府，則極盡嬉笑怒罵之能事，其辭曰：「大不能為盜為寇，小不能為竊為偷，士生今世，本來命裏該休，發甚窮愁，出甚風頭！（一解）妻不能賣乘弄俏，子不會得勢拿權，一枝禿筆，與我生命相價，擺甚臭架，招人笑罵！（二解）妻不能賣乖弄俏，子不會得勢拿權，一枝禿筆，與我生命相連，沒甚新鮮，為的金錢。（三解）當不上舊式名流，交不上時髦政客，沒字招牌，那裏有人認得！管甚黑白，出張潤格！（四解）」玩世不恭，訓語帶刺，只此一端，巳足潦倒終身。</p>
<p>鄭板橋之潤格詩為此道之鼻祖，蓋前人尚有所矯飾，鄭則直言無隱，居之不疑，立意旣已奇僻無倫，而明白揭示「無論親友，概不通融，免開尊口，君子自軍」之大胆作風，尤足令偽君子昨舌。「送禮物不如送銀錢爲妙，有錢則精神百倍，書晝皆佳。」傎無一字不妙。此等市儈語氣，出之以開門見山方式，更不須禮讓確託，是即所請言人所不敢言，為人所不敢為，禮豈為我輩設哉！快人快事，不愧徐靑藤門下走狗。</p>

<h3>大寫數字</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>我國從一至十的數字，，因筆畫過簡，極易改竄，故又有大寫數字，如壹·貳·叁等以代之。像現今使用支票，即須用大寫數字，已成慣例。考之古書，壹與一，貳與二，音義都同。像毛詩　鳩序云。「刺不壹也」；又云：用心之不壹也」；而正文則云：「其儀一也」。是一與壹相通用。孟子神農之言「從許子之道，則市價不貳」，可見戰國時二與貳已相通用了。叁字不見字書，是把「參」字微變之；但古書即把參字代三字，像易緊辭云：「叁天兩地一；釋文云：「參，七南反，又如字，音三。」謂「如字」者，即是說「叁」寫作「參」亦可。又周禮「設其參」，注謂「卿三人」。是皆可證以參代三。</p>
<p>大寫肆·伍·陸·玖·拾五字和小寫四·五等五字音雖同而義則毫不相同。像肆是動詞，作「陳」字解，見毛詩行章章「或肆之筵」句注。伍是集合名詞，五人為「伍，見周禮小司徒「會其什伍而敎之道藝一句注，陸亦是名詞，高平稱一陸一，見周易「漸漸於陸一句注。玖亦是名詞，說文云：石之次玉黑色者，詩曰：一貽我佩玖、那末拾呢，說文云：掇也，从手，合聲。一故是動詞。還有僻義之見於經籍者，不再舉了，</p>
<p>大寫數字之中，捌字獨不見經傳！據急就云：一農器也」，是亦是一名詞；但這「捌」是何形狀，已不可考，故倒可以讓它永遠代「八一下去了、</p>
<p>還有一個柒字，亦不見經傳。最古以「漆」代七，有舉子「周公夕見漆十士一句可證。按漆本是木名，毛詩「山有漆」。漆亦可寫作「桼」。後又有以「桼」代七的，見束晳餅賦：一朝列九鼎之奉，夕宿奈娥之房。」這字是「桼」的　筆　。至現今通用的「柒」字，始見山海經「剛山多柒木一，這柒本即漆樹，故柒字或者　字的俗寫。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Jinan; Bandit Forces Continue to Increase, Reaching 220,000; National Army Voluntarily Withdraws from Qihe County Seat on the North Bank of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] The fighting in the outer perimeter of Jinan is intensifying. In addition to the original bandit forces of the 9th, 13th, 10th, 3rd, 6th, New 8th, 11th, and Bohai Columns, and the local communists, starting from the 17th, the 1st and 4th Columns from the Jining area of southwestern Shandong have also been flocking towards the outer perimeter of Jinan. The bandit forces' so-called mechanized rapid column has also arrived to participate, making the fighting more intense than ever before. Among them, the repeated fighting for Yanchi Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, and Maoling Mountain, about four kilometers southeast of the city, has been the most tragic. The bandit army has suffered more than 10,000 casualties. After 9:00 AM on the 18th, the fighting began to ease slightly. To the west and south of the city, the two armies are still fighting along the line from the ancient city of Changqing (10 kilometers from the city) to Yuhuang Mountain and Chaomidian. Queshan, on the north bank of the Yellow River, was fiercely contested throughout the 17th, but it is still being firmly defended by the National Army. However, the National Army voluntarily withdrew from the Qihe county seat on the night of the 17th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] Since the opening of the Jinan siege, Yanchi Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, and Maoling Mountain, which are about four to six kilometers southeast of Jinan in a straight line from the Thousand Buddha Temple in the south of the city, have always been the main battlefields. Because these mountains can threaten Licheng to the east and control the east of Jinan, starting from the evening of the 17th, the National Army, with the coordination of land and air artillery, launched a counterattack against the bandits at a great cost. The bandits' 13th, 9th, and Bohai Columns and the local communists, possessing more than 30 cannons, launched a full counterattack, causing the sound of planes, artillery, and machine guns to not cease in the entire Jinan area throughout the night of the 17th. By the morning of the 18th, Yanchi Mountain had been briefly recovered by the National Army, but the fierce fighting continues with repeated gains and losses. In addition, the fighting at Kaiyuan Temple at the southern foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain was also fierce on the night of the 17th. By the morning of the 18th, the invading bandits had been repelled.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] Dianliuzhuang, a key point near Hongjialou at the foot of Maoling Mountain, about four kilometers southeast of Jinan, was briefly infiltrated by the bandits on the night of the 17th, but was quickly repelled, eliminating more than 1,000 bandits. Fierce fighting has also broken out near the Agricultural School in the east of the city.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] The bandits attacking Jinan have increased to 220,000. In addition to the nine regular army columns, all units from the central, western, and northern Shandong military regions have been concentrated in Jinan. Although the National Army is outnumbered, under the leadership of Commander Yao Wu, it is actively engaging the enemy. The capital has taken the most urgent measures, and a martial law headquarters has been officially established starting today, with Liu Qixun, the secretary-general of the pacification area, concurrently serving as commander. Martial law will begin every evening at 7:00 PM. The headquarters ordered residents to dig basements and set up more storage pools to prevent accidents. Two-thirds of all male employees of the provincial government agencies have been organized into wartime work teams, with Peng Dong, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Xu Kuiyi, the director of the News Bureau, serving as the team leader and deputy team leader, respectively. The directors of each department and office serve as squad leaders, and they will begin work immediately. The remaining one-third will be responsible for the regular business of the original provincial government. On the 17th, students from the Youth Training Corps were also transferred to the urban area to engage in patrol work. On the 17th, the central government agencies held a meeting and decided that all non-essential personnel should be evacuated.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 18th] According to bandit prisoners, in this bandit army's attack on Jinan, in addition to Chen Yi, the bandit leaders have all sent Ye Jianying to command. The bandits' plan is to sacrifice everything and take Jinan at all costs, so that this "barrier to North China and important coastal town" can replace Yan'an, and a new political consultative conference can be convened and a puppet united government can be established in the short term.</p>
<h3>Powerful Fleet Arrives at Qinhuangdao; Garrison Troops in Beidaihe Relocate to New Positions; Bandit Troops Inside and Outside Changli City Cleared</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] A powerful naval fleet arrived in the waters off Qinhuangdao Port in large numbers on the 17th, and the people of Qinhuangdao are gradually feeling more at ease.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] Around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, more than a hundred bandits were discovered at Xiaohongmen (about ten li from Yongdingmen), on the way from Yongdingmen to Nanyuan in the old capital. After coming into contact with the local forces, they fled eastward.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Yixian; People's Organization and Training Demonstrate Strength</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 18th] Military News: (1) Yizhou has turned from danger to safety. The Jinzhou-Xingcheng Railway was repaired and opened to traffic on the 18th.

The work of organizing and training the people in Northeast China has demonstrated its strength.</p>

The Baoding National Army is closely monitoring the bandits' movements. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the bandits launched a small-scale harassment of Baoding, concentrating five independent battalions from Xushui, Anxin, Gaoyang, Qingyuan, and Qingyuan to launch a sneak attack on the National Army's defensive positions on three sides (east, south, and north) within a twelve-li radius of Baoding. The sound of guns and artillery accompanied the moonlit night. At dawn, the bandits withdrew without success.</p>

He was highly commended by the authorities and promoted to lieutenant colonel.

<h3>US Agrees to Use Army and Navy Ships to Transport Chinese Military Supplies; Claims of Wedemeyer's Return to China Dismissed by Washington as Groundless</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The Howard newspaper reported on the 18th that the US Army and Navy have agreed to use their ships to transport supplies to China, as long as China can afford to purchase them. The newspaper said that this agreement was recently concluded between the Chinese government and the Department of the Army, removing another obstacle to the implementation of the $125 million military aid plan for China. Before the agreement, China had to charter commercial ships, which were expensive, and the West Coast longshoremen's strike made the work difficult. However, the newspaper stated that the packaging and inspection fee for every thousand bullets is $20.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] According to sources close to General Wedemeyer, the rumors from Shanghai that Wedemeyer would return to China and be responsible for military assistance are groundless. According to sources in the Department of Defense, US military aid to China is still awaiting Marshall's decision on everything. The financial aspects of transporting materials to China by the military are not insurmountable technical problems. According to US law, the receipts from the transfer of such materials should be submitted to the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said on the 17th that the embassy was unaware of the rumors that Lieutenant General Wedemeyer would return to China to lead a new US military plan for China. The above information comes from Chinese newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. State Department spokesman McDermott also said that he was unaware of the rumored trip to China by Wedemeyer.</p>

<h3>US Reporter Van Ziewa Claims Internal Strife Seems to Be Occurring Within the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th United Press] Van Ziewa, a correspondent in Shanghai for the New York World Telegram, reported that the Chinese Communist Party seems to be experiencing internal strife. According to sources deemed reliable, Lin Biao, commander of the Communist forces in the Northeast, seems to be following in the footsteps of Yugoslav Marshal Tito. There are many signs of intense power struggles behind the Iron Curtain in the Northeast. Lin Biao is increasingly acting on his own, while Mao Zedong, the darling of the Kremlin, wants to ensure that the Northeast is safely returned to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the relationship between the civil administration personnel controlled by Mao Zedong and the military and political personnel under Lin Biao is very strained. Lin Biao may break away from Mao Zedong and Moscow, dominate one side, and become a new warlord in the Northeast. He may also join hands with other groups opposed to the Kuomintang.</p>

<h3>Disposal of Remaining Materials Not Yet Properly Handled; President Sets a Deadline for Inventory and Classification; Supervision Team Established in Shanghai, with Zheng Jiemin Concurrently Serving as Team Leader; Daily Necessities Distributed to Civil Servants, Educators, and Social Organizations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] The President is paying close attention to the disposal of remaining materials. According to recent reports, the disposal of remaining materials has not been properly handled, and there have even been cases of jeeps rusting. The President was very angry upon hearing this and issued a handwritten order to quickly inventory and classify the remaining materials within ten days and dispose of them according to their respective natures. After receiving the order, the relevant authorities have actively strengthened the inventory and classification work and established a remaining materials inventory supervision team in Shanghai, with Zheng Jiemin concurrently serving as the team leader, Jiang Biao as the deputy team leader, and Zeng Qingji, chief of staff of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, as the general manager. The team has begun inspecting warehouses of remaining materials in Shanghai, conducting inventory and classification, and will go to Qingdao and other places to conduct inventory and supervision work.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] In order to increase the national treasury income, absorb idle funds, and stabilize the economy, the government has adopted a variety of effective measures. The disposal of US surplus materials is now being actively carried out. The total amount of surplus materials that have not yet been processed is approximately 5 million tons. Military supplies have been allocated to the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Transportation for military use. Daily necessities and other non-military items have been decided to be sold quickly to supply the market in order to recover idle funds. It is estimated that after the sale of surplus materials (excluding military supplies), 200 million gold yuan can be recovered. After research by relevant parties, it is believed that the method of selling through retail outlets is easily exploited by scalpers for profit and is very inappropriate. The allocation method will be adopted instead. The allocation area will start with Nanjing and Shanghai first. Civil servants, educators, various social organizations, and schools can enjoy the allocation. The Materials Supply Bureau is responsible for the allocation work in Shanghai. An office has been established in Nanjing, and it has been decided to set up an allocation department. The building of the Capital Power Plant at Xinjiekou has been selected as the address of the allocation department. When allocating, purchases will be made with certificates. Allocation certificates are being rushed to be printed in Shanghai, totaling 150,000 copies. They will be taken to Nanjing for use after printing. There are sixteen types of surplus materials for allocation. During allocation, each person is only allowed to purchase surplus materials worth 15 gold yuan per month. The allocation is scheduled to begin on October 1st. If preparations are not completed in time, it will be changed to begin in mid-October. The first batch of surplus materials for allocation in Nanjing is blue cloth, totaling approximately 5,000 bolts. It has been shipped from Qingdao to Nanjing via Shanghai. Each civil servant can purchase approximately five yards during allocation. The work of selling these surplus materials is expected to be completed within three months. However, because some surplus materials have not yet been shipped from the Pacific Ocean, it may take half a year to complete all sales.</p>

<h3>On Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Written for the Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Exhibition</p>
<p>Another year easily passes, and autumn winds blow once more. In this season when golden winds deliver coolness, the importance of hygiene should be greatly emphasized. People often neglect hygiene in the autumn, but the importance of autumn hygiene is no less than that of summer. Just look at the fact that there are more patients in autumn than in summer, which is a proof. Moreover, epidemic diseases often occur during autumn. The so-called "summer-autumn addiction" is actually cholera, which people in the past called “turning qi”, resulting in many deaths. Cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and so on, are also commonly seen in late autumn. This time, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's hygiene exhibition, which starts tomorrow (20th), should serve as a warning to everyone.</p>
<p>President Chiang's recent launch of the Diligence and Frugality Movement includes promoting physical labor as the third item in the outlined key goals to advance the national health movement because a healthy physique is the source of strength. Precisely because of this, we must pay more attention to hygiene to coordinate with this diligence and frugality construction movement.</p>
<p>Speaking of hygiene in China, it invariably evokes a strong sense of the times, making one unable to suppress the surge of emotions and the feeling of being overwhelmed by the tides of change. Originally, China lags behind others in everything, and hygiene is even worse. The result of this backwardness is selfishness and self-interest in the spiritual realm, and poverty and hardship in the material realm. Because of the lack of attention to hygiene, the disease rate is particularly high, reaching an average of sixteen million people sick every day! Because of the lack of attention to hygiene, the mortality rate is particularly alarming, with more people dying in vain each year than the entire population of Shanghai! Other countries have an average life expectancy of over sixty years, while we remain at thirty years! Diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery have almost become historical terms in other countries, while we are still experiencing annual epidemics. How can we estimate this loss? What can we use to redeem this loss?</p>
<p>The war of resistance has been won, and the enemy has retreated. If those who we expect to shoulder the great task of revival are either mentally abnormal or intellectually deficient, either morally depraved or suffering from various ailments, then I ask, where will the flower of victory, watered by the red blood of millions, bloom? Who will pass on the torch of culture? Can such undertakings be shouldered by people whose bodies and minds are not sound? A weak mind housed in a weak body is nothing but a walking corpse. Our nation is not lacking in the intelligence of an Edison, but lacks the body of an Edison; some may have Edison's body but lack Edison's intelligence. Therefore, we have not yet discovered a Chinese Edison!</p>
<p>Hygiene is a path to achieving health, and our country valued it particularly in ancient times. The term "hygiene" appeared as early as the pre-Qin period. Zhuangzi recorded a passage from Nanrong Zhao asking Laozi: "If Zhao hears the Great Dao, it is like a doctor wanting to add medicine to the illness. Zhao wishes to hear only the principles of hygiene." Both Emperor Yan and Emperor Huang were hygienists, establishing national thought on the principles of hygiene. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the purpose of our national politics is the two words "preservation". It can be seen that far-sighted politicians must advocate hygiene because hygiene is the biological foundation of the nation.</p>
<p>A nation is biological, a country is political. It is absurd to expect political clarity when the biological foundation is poor. Currently, everyone is demanding political clarification but not considering the biological foundation. This is abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, climbing a tree to catch fish. Hygiene is to the people as water is to fish, gaining it means life, losing it means death, this is true for the people and also true for the country. Historians say that the demise of Greece and Rome was due to a few mosquitoes. Was the success or failure of the Panama Canal not due to the issue of hygiene? Hygiene is a very important part of the modernization process; it establishes the foundation for the biological state of a nation. A nation that does not care about the biological foundation, a nation that only knows how to use biological capital but does not consciously and automatically increase this capital, is extremely dangerous. It is also very short-sighted for a country to only study biology for the sake of medicine and animal husbandry, without studying biology for the sake of the intrinsic health of the people themselves, and sooner or later it will suffer the consequences of this shortsightedness.</p>
<p>In recent years, everyone only knows how to compete with others verbally for the so-called position as one of the four great powers or one of the five great powers, but no one asks about how to improve the general quality of the nation to achieve physical strength and stature that surpasses others. Is this not a "lamentable" thing? Currently, we are using the biological capital inherited from our ancestors every minute. Everyone only knows how to use the capital left by our ancestors as much as possible. There will come a day when the oil runs dry and the lamp goes out. If we do not promote hygiene and implement hygiene, I think the day when the oil runs dry and the wick burns out is not far away. Please look at our "complete annihilation" in the Second World Games, and look at how others can maintain their tanks for six hours, while we struggle for two hours. Is this not a sign of national elimination?</p>
<p>Military failure can lead to national subjugation, and neglecting hygiene can lead to the extinction of the race. Everyone should not lightly dismiss hygiene as a small matter, but should know that everything is revealed between the lines. Zhang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, is aware of this and has spared no effort in promoting hygiene. This time, he is holding a hygiene exhibition in the midst of all kinds of difficulties. His intention is profound and his efforts are painstaking. All of us citizens should understand and practice it. Hygiene is not about talking but about practice. Hygiene habits are more important than hygiene knowledge. Citizens should realize something after seeing the exhibition. Know that hygiene is not only a personal matter, but also a matter for future generations, and even more so for the entire nation. We must use great effort to promote and glorify it, so as not to betray the meaning of this exhibition.</p>
<p>Hygiene does not necessarily cost money; sometimes it can even save money. Hygiene is definitely not a waste; on the contrary, hygiene is very economical. Sometimes it is necessary to invest in hygiene, but this investment is a very wise investment. Professor L. Bomer said, "A ditch in a village is as beneficial to the village as the opening of the Panama or Suez Canal is to the country." In England, community houses with more than 400 people have health construction. In the early days of the Soviet Union's construction expenses, hygiene was also the top priority. Sunlight is a free and inexhaustible tonic. Sunbathing can allow ultraviolet rays to irradiate subcutaneous fat, allowing the body to produce its own vitamin D, which can be used by the body to absorb calcium. Is this not only free but also saves money, saving the need to buy cod liver oil and nutritional products. Brown rice is more valuable than white rice, does this not save money as well? Furthermore, is it not that sufficient sleep and frequent bathing also require money? Can't you eat one less pack of cigarettes and drink a few more bowls of tofu soup?</p>
<p>In addition to emphasizing personal hygiene, we must also pay attention to the safety of society and the public at all times. Personal hygiene and public hygiene are originally one thing. If everyone can focus on themselves, the entire society will naturally become hygienic. Yang Zhu's philosophy of "for myself" in the end also serves society. Chinese people's selfishness and self-interest are abnormally developed. Therefore, while personal hygiene is emphasized, it may simultaneously achieve the effect of public hygiene in other countries, but not in China. Driven by the selfish and self-interested mindset of "everyone sweeping the snow in front of their own door," it is easy to develop into all kinds of "harming others to benefit oneself," and ultimately "harming others without benefiting oneself." Look at the medicine dregs all over the ground, and look at "a double cold, success at first sight." What is this mentality? Claiming to be civilized people, it seems to be a bit better about spitting everywhere, but they don't spit at home, but still spit on the streets and in public places. They don't spit in front of people, but still spit behind their backs. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Hygiene is a war, and all countries in the world should participate. The enemies of hygiene are sometimes a bacterium, sometimes a louse or flea, sometimes a fly or mosquito, a dog or a rat, sometimes an inanimate chemical substance, sometimes a product of the human brain or hand, and sometimes it is ourselves. We should start fighting from ourselves! For hygiene and health, we should unite the entire city, the entire country, and all of humanity to fight together. This affects the life and happiness of each of us, and even the nation and all of humanity. Everyone should participate in a part of this battle.</p>
<h3>The Peace and Security Authorities Dispatched Personnel to Tianjin to Crack a Smuggling and Transporting Organization, Capturing Three Key Culprits Who Were Taken to Beiping for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] The Peace and Security Authorities recently cracked a secret organization of the 3rd Smuggling and Transporting Station of the Communist Bandit Jizhong 10th Military Sub-district in Tianjin. The bandit's smuggling and transporting station was disguised as the Dacheng Military Uniforms and Leather Goods Factory, but in reality, it supplied a large number of military leather goods and clothing to the bandits, and transported skilled workers. The key culprits, Yang Baozhen, Wang Zuming, and Jiao Lingfeng, were arrested by personnel sent from here in conjunction with the Tianjin police and gendarmerie and taken to Beiping for interrogation. The remaining criminals, Zheng Xin, Zhang Yunming, Liu Wenbin, and You Yongkang, have all escaped and are being actively pursued. According to confessions, after the victory in the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the bandit station transported military supplies to the bandit area three times via waterways, the first time with thirty boxes, the second time with twenty-four boxes, and the third time with twenty-eight boxes. They also used trucks to transport multiple times, including 15,000 gun slings, ammunition boxes, gun holsters, saddles, leggings, drums, horns, and other items. Jiao Lingfeng also personally led twenty skilled workers to Ba County to take on technical work to aid the bandit rebellion. According to investigations, the bandit station belongs to the Yongmao Fourth Branch, which is jointly organized by the Communist Bandit Jizhong Military Region 10th Military Sub-district and the Communist Bandit Jizhong Administrative Office 10th Special Office. Above it, there is a head office, which belongs to the Communist Bandit Jizhong Administrative Office and the Communist Bandit Military Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Report on the Supervisory Committee's Investigation of the Xu Tao Case</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) 3. Regarding the suspicious leads of transaction accounts within the exchange and illegal gains from off-exchange transactions, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau should be requested to summon individuals according to the severity of their involvement, release them on bail or detain them, and submit the cases to the Shanghai Local Court or the Special Criminal Court for handling. 4. Wang, a supervisor appointed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, together with Shen Yunlong, were ordered to examine and verify the transaction amounts reported by each broker from August 17th to 19th, focusing on accounts with over 3 million shares. Based on the aforementioned procedures and the results of separate investigations, the following 22 brokers were found to have sold over 3 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock and/or were suspected of engaging in off-exchange transactions: No. 55, No. 85, No. 95, No. 224, No. 235, No. 204, No. 150, No. 65, No. 135, No. 4, No. 190, No. 129, No. 76, No. 71, No. 16, No. 28, No. 237, No. 213, No. 145, No. 89, No. 12, and No. 2. Among them: (1) Lin Legeng of Securities No. 190 admitted to off-exchange transactions, claiming to have bought 16 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock from broker Du Weiping of No. 237 on August 16th. (2) Those suspected of off-exchange transactions include Jiechang Securities No. 85, rumored to have engaged in many transactions but with very simple records; Lifeng Securities No. 145, with few transactions recorded but a large amount of money exchanged; and Yungcheng Securities No. 2, which failed to clearly explain the source of its involvement with money shop notes. (3) In terms of exchange transactions, Shen Xing Securities No. 76 sold the most, with 11.9 million shares, including 4 million shares for the client Mi Gengji, the largest single amount. Xiangda Securities No. 213's clients, Taiji and Wei Jiangting, came in second with 3 million shares. Very few had more than 2 million shares, and those with over 1 million shares were also rare.</p>
<p>Summoning Many People</p>
<p>Based on the above inspection results, the police bureau was notified to summon Du Weiping on the morning of September 5th. He confessed that he sold a total of 16 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock to Lin Legeng between August 11th and 16th, and on the 19th, he dumped 5 million shares to Tianyu, 3 million shares to Zhenchang, and 4 million shares to Maode. He also stated that at 9:00 AM on the 19th, a client named Li Boqin, accompanied by two women, jointly dumped 6 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock (later confirmed by Tao Liguolan as over 7 million shares), opening accounts under the names "Lan Ji" and "Shu Ji" respectively. He later heard Li Boqin claim to others that he had obtained advance information about the currency reform. Based on this lead, the committee requested the police bureau to issue summons for Li Boqin and the two women for questioning. However, Li Boqin could not be found. Only Li Guolan, who opened the account under "Lan Ji," and Yang Shuyao, who opened the account under "Shu Ji," were detained. Under interrogation, Li Guolan confessed that her husband was Tao Qiming, currently the secretary of the Ministry of Finance and director of the Information Office, who came to Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of August 18th and returned to Beijing by train on the night of the 19th. She admitted to dumping 2 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock at Huamei on the morning of the 19th, while her brother Li Boqin dumped 3 million shares. Yang Shuyao confessed that her husband was Xu Zhuanghuai, currently the chief secretary of the China Petroleum Corporation in Nanjing, and admitted to accompanying Li Guolan to Huamei on the morning of the 19th to dump 2 million shares of "Yung Shai" stock. The case began to come to light at this point. The committee members, suspecting Tao Qiming of being deeply involved, immediately requested Lin Chongyong, director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, to take responsibility for telegraphing Wang Yunwu, Minister of Finance, and ask him to detain Tao Qiming immediately for further investigation. They also requested Director Lin to inform Minister Wang to maintain strict confidentiality in Shanghai and temporarily refrain from releasing any news in Beijing before the case was clarified, so as to prevent the individuals involved from escaping. Director Lin subsequently reported that he had obtained Minister Wang's consent to temporarily refrain from releasing news in Beijing and had detained Tao Qiming that evening.</p>
<p>Detaining and Interrogating Tao and Xu</p>
<p>In order to save time and thoroughly investigate the matter, the committee members, in addition to presenting opinions based on the situation and results obtained in Shanghai, requested the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to continue the investigation and sent letters to Special Commissioner Jiang Jingguo and Director Lin Chongyong, asking them to supervise and assist. On the morning of September 4th, they returned to the capital and visited Police Chief Huang of the Police Department, and went to the Criminal Police Team to interrogate Tao Qiming with the responsible police officers. After repeated questioning, Tao finally admitted that between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM on August 18th, Xu Baiqi, chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, had sent a worker to summon him to Xu's office, where he was secretly informed of the plan to temporarily suspend the operation of the money shops and the stock exchange, and instructed to go to Shanghai immediately to inform Yuan Yang'an. His means of transportation to Shanghai were also arranged with Xu's consent, by taking a plane. Tao then discussed with Xu Zhuanghuai and considered it possible to speculate and profit from this information. Xu also asked Tao to invite his wife, Yang Shuyao, to act together in Shanghai. Therefore, Xu Zhuanghuai bought a China National Aviation Corporation plane ticket from Beijing to Shanghai for Tao Qiming, and he flew to Shanghai at 6:00 PM that afternoon. He followed Xu Baiqi's instructions and informed Yuan Yang'an of the news. On the morning of the 19th, his wife Li Guolan invited her brother Li Boqin and Yang Shuyao to go to Huamei Company to sell "Yung Shai" stock short. According to this confession, Xu Baiqi, chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Xu Zhuanghuai, chief secretary of the China Petroleum Corporation, and Yuan Yang'an, a lawyer practicing in Shanghai, were suspected of leaking state secrets and attempting to use this secret information for their own benefit. The committee members immediately notified Police Chief Huang of the Capital Police Department, asking him to detain Xu Baiqi, Xu Zhuanghuai, and Yuan Yang'an separately. However, Xu Zhuanghuai had already left Beijing for Shanghai by car on the evening of September 3rd, when Minister Wang publicly released a statement. The committee members, in addition to requesting the Capital Police Department to send personnel to Shanghai to cooperate with the Shanghai Police Bureau to strictly apprehend him and summon Yuan Yang'an, had Xu Baiqi detained by the Police Department on the evening of September 5th. Unexpectedly, Xu was well-prepared and strongly denied leaking state secrets. After much persuasion, he finally revealed everything, although his confession differed slightly from Tao Qiming's. However, considering the confessions of Tao Qiming and Yuan Yang'an, there was no doubt that he intentionally leaked state secrets and had ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Two People on the Run</p>
<p>On September 7th, Yuan Yang'an was summoned from Shanghai. According to his confession, the content and process of how he learned of the news were completely consistent with Tao Qiming's confession. However, he firmly denied any speculation or profiteering. Whether this was true remained to be investigated, so he was also transferred to the Capital Special Criminal Court for handling by the Police Department. In this case, in addition to Xu Zhuanghuai and Li Boqin fleeing upon hearing the news, making it impossible to ascertain the details and impact of their leaking state secrets and speculative profiteering, the investigation of the criminal acts of all other principals and accomplices was brought to a close at this point.

<p>Bernadotte's Brief Biography</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] Count Folke Bernadotte, who died in Jerusalem today, was fifty-three years old and was the nephew of Swedish King Gustaf V. His father, Prince August, was the youngest son of King Oscar. In 1888, he relinquished the right to inherit the throne because he married a commoner. He was granted the title of Prince Bernadotte. Count Bernadotte was born on January 2, 1895. After completing his studies, he joined the Guards as an officer. In 1928, he left the military and married Miss Manville of the United States, and served as the manager of a business. Later, he served as the head of the Swedish Red Cross. During World War II, he was ordered to negotiate with Germany to liberate detained Danes and Norwegians, and persuaded then-Nazi Interior Minister Himmler to release all 20,000 people detained in concentration camps in March 1945 and hand them over to the Swedish Red Cross. When the German army was defeated, Bernadotte was summoned to Himmler's headquarters and, on his behalf, offered the Allies the complete surrender of the German army on the Western Front, but the Allies demanded the unconditional surrender of the entire German army. On May 20, 1948, the UN Security Council asked him to serve as the Palestine mediator. Although he facilitated two truces, his work was not fully completed. Bernadotte was also the vice-chairman of the International Red Cross and held many勋章 medals.</p>

<h3>Surrender Ceremony Officially Held Yesterday; Indian Troops Enter Hyderabad Capital; Nehru Considering Governing Methods</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 18th] Hyderabad Radio announced this afternoon that the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army has accepted the surrender of the Hyderabad army. Prince Belar, the son of the Nizam, represented Hyderabad at the surrender ceremony. General Edroos, the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by Indian Special Envoy General Munshi, represented India.

Chaudhry, commander of the Indian 1st Armored Division, has been appointed Governor of Hyderabad.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 18th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru convened a cabinet meeting on the 18th to consider the fate of the Nizam dynasty, which has ruled Hyderabad for two centuries. The Nizam has accepted most of India's conditions, such as banning the Razakar Muslim extremist organization, stationing Indian troops in Secunderabad, and forming a new government. India has not yet indicated whether it intends to recognize the emergency governing council established by the Nizam on the 17th and presided over by Prince Belar. In the current chaotic situation, Hyderabad will be governed like Japan under MacArthur, at least for a few days. Due to the intricate and delicate nature of religious issues, a final resolution is likely to be delayed. It is believed here that the Nizam's throne will be decided by a plebiscite under the auspices of India. However, India's attention has shifted to Kashmir. The press predicts that the troops currently in Hyderabad will be redeployed north to deal with the Muslim irregulars of the Pakistani army in Kashmir. The Indian government announced that telephone and telegram communications between India and Hyderabad have been restored on the morning of the 18th, but before normal conditions are restored, only official military communications are allowed. The Minister of the Interior praised the efforts of the police for the absence of Indian-Muslim conflict throughout India during the military operations in Hyderabad. All India Radio also denied reports of Indian-Muslim conflict within Hyderabad.</p>

<h3>French Parliament Debates New Fiscal Plan; Guy Mollet Requests Vote of Confidence</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 18th] The French cabinet held a ten-minute symbolic meeting on the 18th, authorizing Prime Minister Guy Mollet to request a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on the government's fiscal taxation bill. The bill, requiring the collection of 100 billion francs in taxes, will be submitted for debate on the morning of the 18th. Mollet is wagering the fate of the government in an attempt to force a showdown, compelling all parties in the coalition cabinet to vote in unison to pass the economic plan. Simultaneously, the Senate overturned the National Assembly's resolution to postpone local elections, advocating for them to be held in October. It is widely believed that the Gaullist faction will win a landslide victory in the local elections, leading to the downfall of the current ruling centrist parties. Although the National Assembly only needs a majority vote to postpone the elections, such a move would draw accusations of "evading the voters."</p>

<h3>Fuel Management Committee Embezzlement Under Investigation; Director and Staff Detained Late at Night; Suspicions of Bribery in Obtaining Procurement Permits; Two Military Personnel and Two Businessmen Also Arrested</h3>
<p>Yang Yunfu, Director of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee of this city, and Zou Ji, a staff member, are suspected of colluding with businessmen to engage in embezzlement by abusing their authority. They were interrogated by the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Department until late last night and were detained on the spot due to strong suspicion. Zhao Bojun, a colonel-level officer of a certain military organization related to the case, and Mao Meixuan, the person in charge of Gongda Coal Company, had already been arrested before Yang and Zou were detained.

He entrusted Zhao to contact Yang Yunfu to obtain a procurement permit. Yang then instructed his staff member Zou Jidao to negotiate with Mao Meixuan, a salesman at Gongda Coal Company, to obtain the permit in the name of the company and agreed to give a commission of 2% for the consignment of the coal. Zhao Bojun requested a handling fee of 2 billion yuan when handing the permit to his client, raising suspicions of bribery involving Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao.

<h3>Authorities Improve Economic Inspection Work; Establish Inspection Standards; Focus on Not Disturbing the People; Primarily Inspect Large Warehouses and Hoarders</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] It is reported that the economic management authorities will improve the economic inspection work based on the experience of the past month. The first step is to establish inspection standards to make them reasonable and adapt them to local conditions. For example, when dealing with hoarding cases, the decision to confiscate or force the sale at a fixed price will be made based on the objective circumstances and the severity of the situation. Secondly, future inspections will be based on the principle of not disturbing the people or being overly meticulous, and efforts will be made to simplify laws and procedures. The target of inspections will be primarily large warehouses and hoarders. The competent authorities have issued an order requiring inspectors to be moderate and kind when performing their duties. Any extortionary behavior will be severely punished once verified, and those who report it will be rewarded. If bribery occurs, both the bribe-taker and the bribe-giver will be equally guilty. The letters of informants must include the true name and address. The inspection agency will keep their information strictly confidential. Reports using false names and addresses will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Gold, Foreign Currency, and Gauze; Black Market Eliminated</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of economic control, prices have generally stabilized. According to reports received by the Supervisory Office, the black market for gold, foreign currency, and gauze can be said to be completely nonexistent. The amount of deposits in banks has increased three to four times compared to before the currency reform, and interest rates have also fallen sharply. According to relevant officials, in order to maintain market stability, economic inspection work must be further strengthened. As of now, the major "players" at sea have not committed any obvious illegal acts, so they are only being warned and instructed to maintain the stability of prices in their respective industries. At the same time, it is hoped that in the future, if citizens have reports to make, they can report major players as much as possible and not pay too much attention to minor matters. As long as the evidence is conclusive, no matter how powerful their background is, they will be dealt with severely according to the law. In recent days, staff members have discovered that some people are carrying large amounts of gold, foreign currency, and silver dollars to leave Shanghai, with suspected intent to flee. If this is discovered again in the future, those who do so before September 30 will be forced to exchange them at the Central Bank. Those who conceal and fail to report after the deadline will be punished. The measures are currently being drafted.</p>

Wu, who is also the chairman of the committee, presided over the meeting and stated in his speech, "The Central Government has promulgated measures for the registration of people's foreign exchange funds in the new economic plan. All those who have foreign exchange, whether natural persons or legal persons, should register their foreign exchange, whether in cash or assets, with the consulate if they are abroad, and with the National Bank if they are in the country, by the end of December this year. All registered foreign exchange assets will be kept by the National Bank. The past sources of foreign exchange will not be investigated, but those who fail to apply for registration or secretly transfer them to others in an attempt to evade registration will not only have all of their assets confiscated, but will also be sentenced to imprisonment for up to seven years. The task of the meeting is to encourage industrial and commercial circles to handle the registration as soon as possible." Pan Gongzhan then stated in his speech, "Those who register will be absolutely protected. If factories need to purchase raw materials from abroad, they can be withdrawn for use within the scope permitted by the government. I have two hopes: (1) to declare early, and hope that all industrial and commercial groups will declare within days, and do not delay. (2) Encourage each other to promote and set an example." Wu Changfu, the representative of the National Bank, then explained the methods and procedures for declaring foreign exchange in detail, and explained the method of withdrawing foreign currency deposits from the Central Bank after registration. Finally, Du Yuesheng, Jiang Hao, and others successively expressed their views, earnestly urging all industries to actively handle the registration, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Subletter Beaten to Death; District Procuratorate Indicts Three</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Li Xu Zaoxian, a local resident, rented a room on the mezzanine floor of No. 54, Lane 50, Kulun Road from Yang Huang Xiuying last year, agreeing on a rent of 250,000 yuan in legal tender per month. The rent was increased by 100,000 yuan in June of this year. At the end of June, Yang requested to collect two dou of white rice from July 7th, but Li refused because the demand was too high. On July 7th, Yang asked Li to pay again, resulting in a conflict between the two sides, followed by a mutual fight. At that time, Li's cousin Xu Muna and Yuan Zhichang happened to be there and immediately helped Li beat Yang, causing injuries. On July 20th, the two sides fought again over minor matters, and Li and the other two surrounded Yang and beat her again. As a result, Yang was injured internally, resulting in a perforation of the duodenum. She was sent to the China Hospital and the Municipal Fifth Hospital for emergency treatment, but died on the 27th. After the District Procuratorate concluded the investigation of this case, it filed a public prosecution against Li and the other two on the charge of injury causing death.</p>

<h3>Child Emergency Relief Work; Review Committee Distributes Milk Powder; First Batch of Over 4,000 Pounds; Distributed to Twelve Units</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Since the Shanghai District Child Emergency Relief Work Review Committee was ordered to organize and carry out research, statistics, and investigation, it completed the preliminary investigation work of the infant group on the 12th.

<h3>Saving Public Property and Funds; Eliminating Long-Standing Habits; New Work Style of the Grain Purchase and Storage Association; Praised as a Model of Thrift</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The head of the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Association of the Ministry of Food, Mr. Yang, can be said to be a representative of government officials in Shanghai whose life and work truly embody the spirit of the National Thrift and Construction Movement. The reporter believes that all facilities within the association are worthy of being a model for public agencies and civil servants throughout the country. The association has no guards, no messengers, and even no janitors. The transmission of official documents and the handling of official business within the association are all done by each individual personally. During office hours, all employees, except for burying themselves in work, are prohibited from drinking tea, reading newspapers, smoking, or chatting. Yang always fills out the association's quarterly forms himself, making the situation of the association clear at a glance. They make every effort to save public property and funds. The size of all documents is reduced to the minimum, and their use is particularly economical. The reporter found a stack of discarded official paper collected by Yang and envelopes made from used envelopes in his desk, proving that he also utilizes waste materials. Yang's emphasis on thrift can be said to be personally practiced. When asked about his opinion on promoting the National Thrift and Construction Movement, he pointed out that "avoiding waste and striving for rationalization in everything are the minimum goals that the Chinese people should strive for." He said: "China's material resources are currently very difficult, but if the Chinese people can all avoid waste, there is still a surplus. Our country is currently relying on food aid from foreign countries, but at the same time, we allow teahouses and restaurants to be full every day, which is the most unreasonable phenomenon. Every time I attend a banquet, I feel deeply pained in my heart." His efforts to be rational in everything can be proved by the following two things: The content and format of official documents have been reformed first; the office space of each employee in the association does not exceed 2.5 square meters. Yang and all the staff share a room, use the same desks and chairs, and occupy the same area. His explanation for this is that his purpose is not to be an official, but to train cadres for the country, so he must set an example so that the spirit of superiors and subordinates will not be disconnected. Yang's relatives have repeatedly urged him to give up his poor government job and return home to do business, but he believes that serving the country should be hard-working and thrifty, and personal interests should not be considered. Before serving as the director of the association, Yang served as the Director of the Construction Department of Jiangxi Province, the Secretary-General of the Chongqing Municipal Government, and the Mayor of Harbin. Yang Chuoan personally practices reusing old envelopes.</p>

<h3>Typhoon's Power Greatly Reduced; Gradually Turns into Low Pressure</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the typhoon landed in northern Fujian the day before yesterday, it was resisted by the mountains on land. After consuming a day and a night, the wind force was greatly reduced, and it gradually turned into a large continental low pressure, moving in a northwesterly direction. By last night, the center reached the border of Zhejiang and Jiangxi. As a result, there were strong winds and rain in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. There was also wind and rain in this city yesterday. The wind force reached level 7 at its strongest, but it gradually decreased in the evening. As the typhoon turns into a low pressure, it may gradually disappear and will not be a threat. The Meteorological Observatory predicts that the weather in this city will turn sunny today.

<h3>Former Traitor Zhou Fohai's Shanghai Residence Grand Robbery Case Cracked, Valuable Ornaments' Estimated Value Exposed, Male and Female Criminals Arrested One After Another, Internal Connection Revealed as Dismissed Female Servant</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the evening of June 26th this year, a robbery occurred at No. 324 Hunan Road (formerly Rue Corneille), the former Shanghai residence of traitor Zhou Fohai. A large amount of precious ornaments such as pearls and diamonds were robbed, with an extremely high value. Afterwards, the victim Rong Liang Shihui reported the case to the Changshu Police Precinct, which was forwarded to the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau. Section Chief Na dispatched Squad Leader Feng Qishan and others to investigate. After more than two months, the case was finally solved, and a large number of stolen goods were recovered. Currently, in addition to continuing to pursue the accomplices who are still at large, the four male and female robbers who have been arrested have been requested by the District Prosecutor's Office to extend their detention for further investigation to determine whether they have committed other crimes. According to reports from our correspondent: After the case occurred, police officers worked painstakingly, but because the robbers were also exceptionally cunning, even though the robbery lasted a long time, they did not leave any fingerprints at the scene. Afterwards, because they had robbed thousands of US dollars, they did not spend the stolen money, so the network of clues they had set up…</p>
<p>...did not develop at all. Until the 16th of this month, Section Chief Peng received a confidential report stating that someone was openly showing a valuable jadeite pearl necklace (one of the stolen items) to jade dealers at Chunhua Building on Daxin Street for valuation. He immediately ordered Squad Leader Feng to supervise the investigating police officers Qian Daqi, Zhang Jingyu, Zhang Yunming, and Ding Zhaogan to investigate the source of the item. As a result, they learned that the necklace belonged to Ma Shoubai, the owner of Tongchang Jewelry Store at No. 397 Zhongzheng Middle Road. The police officers disguised themselves as jewelers and lured Ma into custody. According to his confession, the necklace was not his, but was entrusted to him for sale by Yang Zhenhua, the chairman of the Liren Society at No. 5 Renhe Lane, Changning Road. After summoning Yang for questioning, he confessed that it belonged to Zhang Yunting, the head of the society. Yang then led the police to No. 1 Dongtangzi Jing, Hongqiao Road, where Zhang was arrested. A gemstone gold ring was also seized on the spot. After interrogation, Zhang confessed to having conspired with others to…</p>
<p>...rob Rong's residence, and also revealed that there were accomplices hiding in a thatched shed at Wangjiazhai on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, and at No. 702 Xixin Street, Chang'an Road. As a result, Zhang Haibo and his wife Li Fengying, and Tong Hongyou, were arrested, and a large number of stolen goods were recovered. Finally, Zhang Yunting led the police to his mother-in-law's house in Pingwang Lane, Yongle Road, where a revolver with five bullets was recovered. After individual interrogations of the suspects, it was learned that the insider who provided information in this case was Li Fengying (also Zhang Haibo's wife), a female servant who had been dismissed from Rong's residence in January of this year for improper conduct. Because there are still accomplices at large, the case is still…</p>
<p>...under continued pursuit. The recovered stolen items include: a jadeite pearl necklace, a diamond-studded jadeite gemstone gold key, two diamond-studded watches, a one-carat diamond ring, an Omega men's watch, a gold bracelet, a gold chain, a pair of jadeite diamond jade earrings, a pair of square diamond earrings, two gold-set jadeite rings, one ruby, one emerald, one platinum ring, a gold chain bracelet, a square gold watch, a gold chain strap and gold square box, a beaded handbag, etc., a total of nineteen items, accounting for about eight-tenths of the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Worsted Wool Price Limit Issue, Social Affairs Bureau Negotiates Several Points, Fashion Industry Will Request Factory to Dispatch Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon convened representatives from the Wool Textile Industry, Worsted Wool, Silk and Satin, Cotton Cloth, Western Clothing, and Fashion Trade Associations to discuss and study the issue of worsted wool price limits: (1) Group Weaving (heavy wool) was not available on August 19th.

(2) For worsted wool with prices available on August 19th, all retail stores should strictly follow the prices on August 19th. At the same time, in order to maintain factory re-production, the profits of retailers and wholesalers will be appropriately reduced to effectively cooperate with the price limits. (3) In order to reduce the profits of intermediaries and reduce costs, the fashion industry will request each factory to dispatch goods under the overall planning of the trade association.</p>
<h3>"Mystery of Madness" Case Continues, Only Defendant Huang Yingbang Arrives</h3>

<h3>Supervisory Committee's Report on the Xu Tao Case (Continued from Page 2)</h3>
<p>(II) Truth of the Case</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned on-site investigation, the truth of this case includes the following points: 1. The content of the leaked state secret was the order drafted by the Ministry of Finance on August 18th and announced on the 19th to "Temporarily Suspend the Business of Banks, Qianzhuang, and Trading Houses." 2. This confidential and important document was dictated by Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance, with the consent of Minister Wang, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM on August 18th in Vice Minister Xu's office, and was drafted by Xu Baiqi, the chief secretary of the ministry. 3. After Xu Baiqi finished drafting the order and left the office, he informed Secretary Tao Qiming of the contents of the confidential order, instructing him to go to Shanghai that day to inform Yuan Yang'an. 4. After learning of this confidential news, Tao Qiming consulted with Xu Zhuanghuai, the director of the Nanjing China Petroleum Corporation of the Resource Commission. Xu Zhuanghuai purchased a plane ticket for Tao Qiming for that day, and Tao took a China Aviation flight from Nanjing to Shanghai at 6:00 PM. Xu also asked Tao to inform his wife Yang Shuyao to jointly participate in short-selling for profit. 5. After Tao Qiming arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM that evening, he discussed speculation with his wife and arranged to meet Yuan Yang'an by phone. Yuan was out, but after receiving a call from Yuan, Tao went to Yuan's place at 10:00 PM that evening to convey Xu Baiqi's confidential news.</p>
<p>Establishing Accounts for Short Selling</p>
<p>6. Li Guolan, Tao Qiming's wife, invited Xu Yang Shuyao and Li Boqin to Huamei Company, operated by Du Weiping, at around 9:00 AM on the 19th of August. With the introduction of Li Boqin, they separately opened "Li Ji" and "Shu Ji" accounts, short-selling more than 7 million shares of Yongsha stock, with Li Guolan selling 2 million shares, Yang Shuyao selling 2 million shares, and Li Boqin selling more than 3 million shares. Although Li Guolan had previously engaged in stock trading, it was said that this was her first time since returning to Shanghai from Taiwan. 7. After short-selling at Huafu, Li Boqin stated that he had learned of the currency reform news. The stock market fell sharply that day. Whether this was caused by him spreading the news is still under investigation as he has not been detained. 8. Whether Xu Zhuanghuai spread this news to others after learning of the secret, allowing them to use it for speculative profit-making, is still under investigation as he has not been detained. 9. It has not yet been determined whether Yuan Yang'an used this information for speculative profit-making on August 19th. If such a situation exists, whether he colluded with Xu Baiqi is also under investigation. 10. In addition to being a legal securities broker, Du Weiping also established Huamei Company to operate over-the-counter trading, which is illegal. Whether the short selling of 12 million shares of Qing Shui Sha stock by Huamei and its 137th Securities Firm on August 19th was based on the news provided by Li Boqin cannot be confirmed because Li Boqin is on the run.</p>
<p>Dereliction of Duty and Misleading the Public</p>
<p>Based on the analysis of the above facts, it is known that the occurrence of this case was actually due to the deliberate leakage of important secrets by Xu Baiqi, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, with ulterior motives. Regardless of whether the suspect had speculative profit-making facts, his crime of leaking secrets, undermining the government's financial and economic emergency measures, and endangering the country should be severely punished according to law to serve as a warning. Tao Qiming, the secretary of the ministry, used confidential information for speculative profit-making, which is illegal. Moreover, spreading the news and causing disturbances constitutes knowingly violating the law, which is also unforgivable. Xu Zhuanghuai, the director of the Nanjing Petroleum Company of the Resource Commission, colluded with Tao Qiming to use confidential information for profit-making, which is a clear violation of criminal law. In addition, Wang Xitang, the supervisor of the Ministry of Finance stationed at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Shen Yunlong, the supervisor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stationed at the exchange, had the duty to supervise and inspect the trading venue for illegal trading activities. They did not fulfill their supervisory responsibilities in advance, and after the committee members were instructed to conduct a strict inspection, they did not provide a thorough report on the illegal trading activities. This constitutes dereliction of duty. Minister of Finance Yu Yunwu trusted close associates and was negligent in his examination, leading to the easy leakage of important state secrets, and it is difficult to absolve him of the blame for employing personnel improperly and neglecting his duties. The above-mentioned personnel, whether they are administrative leaders or important officials, should have acted loyally and cautiously in the implementation of constitutional government and the earnest promotion of financial and economic reforms. However, they neglected their duties, misled important affairs, and were extremely inappropriate. Their cases should be severely punished according to the severity of the circumstances. Li Guolan, Yang Shuyao, Du Weiping, etc., either used confidential information for speculative profit-making or privately established firms for illegal trading, and should all be punished according to the circumstances and according to the law. The two criminals Li Boqin and Xu Zhuanghuai should still be apprehended by judicial authorities to uphold the law.</p>
<p>Rectifying Official Conduct</p>
<p>In short, at this difficult time for the country, when the government is striving for reform, any act of wrongdoing will not be tolerated by the law. The Supervisory Committee is responsible for supervision and should take action under the scrutiny of the world to rectify official conduct and appease public sentiment. In addition to requesting the police authorities in Nanjing and Shanghai to transfer the entire case and the criminals for continued investigation and legal processing, the committee will submit the investigation process of this case, along with the attachments, to the court for verification. This is submitted to President Yu, with eleven related attachments and a list of attachments. Committee members Tang Honglie, Sun Wanglin, September 22nd. (End)</p>

<h3>Western Lake's Strange Phoenix and Heavenly Tide</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Rapid Report from Hangzhou, 17th] These past few days, the banks of West Lake have been experiencing the crisp and refreshing weather of autumn. The crystal-clear moon illuminates the lake surface, and the willows along the embankment bow their heads, whispering softly to the green grass. Tourists row boats, bathed in the moonlight as bright as day. The oars break the silence, heading towards the fragrant depths. This reporter has previously predicted that this year's autumn excursion to Hangzhou will be unprecedentedly lively. Since September 12th, all the large and small hotels in Hangzhou have been completely booked. Several large hotels are planning to borrow villas elsewhere to serve as accommodations for guests. Restaurants and wine shops are all … bustling, and those who arrive later have to wait for a table to be vacated before they can be seated. Rickshaws and palanquin carriers are charging in gold yuan, demanding at least 30 cents. A trip from the train station to the lakefront costs two yuan, and renting a boat costs ten gold yuan. Recently, the boats have been booked solid. I think those who come later will have to rent bathhouses, cars, and cafes, as they did during the spring excursion, as their temporary residences.</p>
<p>Lack of Outlets for Speculative Capital</p>
<p>Legislator Chen Xiaocen told the reporter: "This year's autumn excursion to Hangzhou is truly unprecedented, mostly because speculative capital in Shanghai has no outlet. People who trade in gold, US dollars, cotton yarn, etc., feel that there is no way to do business, so they come to Hangzhou to relax. First, prices are stable. Secondly, the boring speculative buying and selling has led people to come to Hangzhou to relax. But it is also true that the stable prices allow them to play for a few more days. The cool autumn has come very early this year, and the tide in Haining is particularly high. These are all reasons why Hangzhou has become the darling of the times."</p>
<p>Watching the Night Tide on the Eighteenth</p>
<p>Wang Huzhen, the deputy director and chief engineer of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, told the reporter, "The tide this year is truly very large." Just when the tide control project that the Seawall Engineering Bureau was working hard to build was about to be completed, nature unexpectedly changed the course of the river again. The sandbank outside the seawall collapsed, and the surging waves came again. The cultivated land outside Qibao was flooded, and thousands of residents were threatened. Mr. Wang Dongyuan went to watch the tide, and his jeep was pushed into the fields behind the seawall. It is said that the tide at that time was more than ten feet above the seawall and sounded like a mountain collapsing and a tsunami. Wang Huzhen once told the reporter with scientific analysis: "The tide is often determined by the movement of the moon. The tide will be higher when the moon is full because the Chinese calendar is determined by the Imperial Astronomical Bureau established in the feudal era. Since the Republic of China, the new calendar has been used, and the natural shift means that the 15th of the Chinese calendar should fall on the 16th. The 15th is the 14th. Then there will be big bends within a few days from the 16th to the 19th, but the tide will be even bigger at 12:00 PM on the 18th and 19th." Therefore, friends who come to Hangzhou for sightseeing and want to watch the tide should watch the night tide on the 18th. You can see its magnificent posture of rushing with thousands of troops, making you feel like a hero, and strengthening the power of life.</p>
<p>Beauty and Hero</p>
<p>Because of the tide, many important people gathered in Hangzhou and went to Haining to watch the tide. Vice President Li Zongren came, former Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaohong came, He Yaozu came, Minister Zhu Jia… came, Minister He Yingqin is coming, and the American Batavia is also coming. In addition to enjoying the gentle and beautiful scenery of Hangzhou's lakes and mountains, they also went to see the magnificent tide. The two creations of nature evoked two kinds of appreciation. One side is a gentle and beautiful girl, and the other side is a free and uninhibited hero, but this beautiful girl and uninhibited hero are also the result of the hard work of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Autumn Harvest Reduced by Wind and Rain</p>
<p>This year, the Jiang has reported wind and rain disasters in fifty-one counties, which has certainly affected the autumn harvest. In addition, the Hunan granary has banned rice exports due to the major floods. Jiangxi has also banned rice exports because Hunan has no rice to export. Under these circumstances, the food supply in Zhejiang, which has always been known for its grain shortage, is bound to face considerable problems. The city of Hangzhou, which has very little farmland and little production, will be greatly threatened. This year's autumn excursion to Hangzhou is not only lively but also very long and may drag on until the end of autumn and the coming of winter.</p>
<h3>Soldier Zhang Fayun Executed Yesterday for Intercepting Wealthy Woman, Rape, and Extortion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Suzhou, 18th] Zhang Fayun, a soldier in the ordnance depot security guard unit of the Joint Logistics Department in Zhoumo New Village, Pingmen, Suzhou, suddenly became bestial while on duty on the night of February 10th this year.

Next to it is the stone cave of the Jiu'an Salt Paste Company, which is still being mined. In the evening of the 16th, Yong'an salt workers… broke through the Zhongheng Cave, causing … water to pour into the Yong'an Cave, resulting in a major tragedy. Sixty-one workers in the stone cave were drowned to death. For the entire day of the 17th, the families of the workers who died tragically gathered at the Yong'an Company, crying and making noise, and the scene was tragic. In addition to sending people to investigate thoroughly, the county government also sent personnel to the company to be on guard.</p>

<h3>Qiantang Autumn Tide is Extraordinarily Large, Seawall on the North Shore Completed after Emergency Repairs</h3>

<h3>Foreign Banks Begin Reporting Foreign Exchange, Can Be Transferred and Stored in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The work of commercial bank foreign exchange reporting has largely come to an end. According to responsible sources: After strict review, many banks have been found to have made false reports or deliberately not reported. Some banks have been ordered by the Gold Control Bureau to re-report, and it has been stated that if there are any further violations, they will be severely punished, and they may be ordered to suspend business if necessary.</p>
<p>As for the foreign exchange reporting work of foreign banks, an agreement has been reached after negotiations between the Central Bank and the Gold Control Bureau and foreign merchants. They will still be handled in accordance with the commercial bank reporting and registration methods. The local branches of Chase, Citibank, Mercantile, AIA, and other foreign banks have all reported and can be transferred and stored in the short term.</p>
<h3>Financial Industry Capital Increase Issues: More Difficulties for Small Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a responsible person from the Shanghai Banking Association speaking to our reporter, regarding the issue of capital increases for the financial industry in this city, larger banks and firms are not finding it particularly difficult, but smaller banks and firms have not completely overcome the difficulties. Therefore, this group sent three representatives, including Cai Songfu, to visit Director Lin of the Financial Control Bureau (金管局) some days ago. They presented the difficulties to Director Lin based on the various issues related to capital increases previously drafted by the Banking Association. It is reported that Director Lin expressed considerable sympathy and promised to forward the matter to the Ministry of Finance for instructions.</p>
<p>Regarding the gradual reduction of interest rates, the person stated that silver and money businesses have already reduced interest rates twice recently. The 6.6% interest rate on overdue payments and 2.1% interest rate on deposits set on the 17th were implemented only after obtaining the consent of the Financial Control Bureau. In the future, they will gradually reduce interest rates to make them more affordable.</p>
<p>As for the matter of commercial banks and firms depositing foreign exchange, the person stated that large banks and firms are complying with the regulations. Some small banks and firms have not yet completed the reporting procedures, and the responsible parties in the Association are actively urging them to do so, hoping that all members of the industry will support national policy and provide detailed reports.</p>
<h3>Financial Control Bureau Orders Provincial and Municipal Banks to Reduce Lending Rates within a Deadline</h3>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of deposit and lending interest rates for banks and firms, a responsible person from the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau recently told our reporter that after the government announced the measures to restrict deposit and lending interest rates for banks and firms, the Bureau immediately ordered the three industries associations of banks, money firms, and trusts in this city to forward the order to all banks and firms to comply. Starting from September 1st, interest rates were to be reduced by up to 10%. Starting from September 16th, interest rates were to be reduced to within 5% per month. However, commercial banks and firms believed that forcibly lowering interest rates within the time limit would easily affect the market. They complied with the order by gradually reducing interest rates from 12% per month to 7.5% from September 1st to 15th. From September 16th, they further reduced the rate to 6.6%, and will continue to reduce it to within 5% per month in the shortest possible time to comply with the regulations. The Bureau found this reasonable given the circumstances and has reported it to the Ministry for review and approval. The situation for provincial and municipal banks is different, and the Bureau has separately informed them to reduce lending rates to within 5% starting from today (18th).</p>
<h3>Increase in National Bank and Bureau Disbursements</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money market remained loose. National banks and bureaus disbursed a total of 3,710,000 yuan, including 2,930,000 yuan disbursed by the Central Bank, 501,000 yuan disbursed by the Bank of China, 390,000 yuan taken in by the Bank of Communications, 870,000 yuan disbursed by the Farmers Bank, 640,000 yuan disbursed by the Central Trust Bureau, 1,030,000 yuan taken in by the Postal Remittances and Savings Bank, 190,000 yuan disbursed by the Central Cooperative Treasury, and 450,000 yuan taken in by foreign banks. The large clearinghouse took in 480,000 yuan, and the small clearinghouse took in 278,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Region Collects 160 Trillion Legal Tender Notes in One Month</h3>
<p>The currency reform has now been in effect for a full month. During this month, the Central Bank and various entrusted banks have collected large amounts of gold, silver, foreign currencies, and legal tender notes. It is understood that as of yesterday, the total amount of legal tender notes collected in the Shanghai region is approximately 160 trillion (equivalent to over 50 million gold yuan coupons), resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of legal tender notes circulating in the market. The figures for collections in other regions are also considerable, but far less than in this city. As for how to dispose of the collected legal tender notes in the future, the authorities are still considering it. It is possible that they will be concentrated and incinerated after the redemption period expires, or used as raw materials for papermaking.</p>
<h3>Chen Changtong Discusses Improved Overseas Remittance Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Chen Changtong, manager of the International Department of the Bank of China, recently returned from the United States. According to him, the overseas remittance situation has improved since our country reformed the currency system. In the Philippines alone, the amount of money remitted back to the country from August 20th to September 15th has reached over one million US dollars. Before the reform, weekly overseas remittance income was only over one thousand US dollars. As long as domestic prices continue to stabilize, overseas remittance income will inevitably increase in the future.</p>
<h3>Slight Fluctuations in Rice Prices; Limited Price Increase Leads to Stronger Flour Sales</h3>
<p>Rice market prices fluctuated slightly, initially showing a slight increase. However, due to stagnant sales, prices quickly declined, resulting in a stable market overall. Arrivals were still limited, and local sales were normal, resulting in subdued trading. Southern market: White japonica rice was priced at 20.06 yuan, while thin japonica rice held at the limited price of 21.50 yuan. Northern market: High-quality thin japonica rice decreased by 0.20 yuan, while lower-quality rice increased slightly by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. High-quality rice remained stable. Total arrivals in the northern and southern markets yesterday were 2,653 *shi* (石).</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Increased strongly, because the limited price for No. 2 flour was raised to 7.62 yuan (factory price), and the retail price increased to 7.80 yuan. Therefore, market sentiment improved, and prices increased further, with the rise being particularly strong. Old *che* (車) flour was not available. *Bingshuan* (兵船) flour was priced at 7.47 yuan, an increase of 0.22 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour increased uniformly by 0.12 to 0.13 yuan. Wheat bran was priced at the limited price of 5.33 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Remained firm. Yellow soybeans were being supported by foreign firms, so high-quality goods remained firm. *Che* (車) soybeans were priced at 12.33 yuan. However, average quality *zha* (乍) soybeans were transacted at 10 yuan, resulting in a stable market overall. Northern corn sales were active, and the price increased slightly by 0.10 yuan. Red sorghum was in demand, resulting in brisk trading and a price increase of 0.20 yuan. *Yuan dou* (元豆) prices remained stable. Foreign firms were interested in sesame, resulting in a firmer market trend. Shelled peanuts were also in demand by foreign firms. Xuzhou and Kaifeng were both priced at the limited price.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Became uncertain again due to the temporary suspension of export permits. Sellers lacked the strength to resist the downward trend, and prices decreased. Soybean oil was only offered at 48 yuan by Datong, while the lowest spot trading price was 47 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan. Rapeseed oil decreased significantly, with raw oil decreasing by 0.50 yuan, refined oil decreasing by 58.50 yuan, and small junma (軍蔴) oil decreasing by 2.50 yuan. Soybean cake factory prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Limited Transactions in Keemun Black Tea</h3>
<p>In the foreign firm tea market, the Keemun *Jiangjunqiao* (將軍橋) cooperative recently offered black tea in Shanghai. Although British firms Jardine Matheson and Concorde approached the sellers to negotiate, their offers were only between 180 and 190 yuan per *dan* (担). However, the sellers were unwilling to sell at those prices due to high costs, resulting in continued stalled transactions. Other varieties were also traded based on individual prices, resulting in limited transactions. Market sentiment remained stable overall. As for tea sold domestically, supply and demand were balanced, resulting in fluctuating prices.</p>
<p>It was recently learned that before the Mid-Autumn Festival, tea merchants from Tunxi in the tea-producing region came to Shanghai and discussed the local tea market. Due to strong demand from various buyers, supply was already less than demand. In addition, the tea-producing season has already passed, so inventories are decreasing, leading to rising market prices. Looking at the overall situation, if prices continue to rise, the outlook for tea sales in this city will become less optimistic.</p>
<h3>Private Cotton Mill Production and Sales Association Holds Representative Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The cotton spinning industry association in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai regions, in order to align with the government's economic policies and strengthen the connection between private industries' production and sales, specially organized the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai Private Cotton Mill Joint Production and Sales Committee. Yesterday (September 18th) at 3:30 PM, they held a private cotton mill representative meeting. More than seventy representatives attended, including Liu Jingji, Wang Zhuyi, Jiao Tang, and Wang Zijian. First, Standing Director Jingji, chairman, gave a speech. Secretary-General Wang Zhuyi reported on recent association affairs. Then, they discussed and revised the organizational charter of the Joint Production and Sales Committee and passed it. They elected twenty-one committee members, including Liu Jingji, Rong Erren, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, Rong Yixin, Wang Zijian, Wu Kunsheng, Liu Guojun, Han Zhiming, Zhang Wenqian, Tong Lanfu, Shao Baohu, Guo Qiong, Rong Guangliang, Tang Junyuan, Jing Zuheng, Yan Xinqi, Wu Shuying, Dong Chunfang, Wang Tongyuan, and Wang Yuncheng.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Sentiment Declines; Limited External Sales of Cotton Cloth; Many Sellers Willing to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation was such that market sentiment declined immediately due to the authorities' temporary suspension of measures to export goods. Buyers stopped purchasing, and local sales were also scarce, causing the market to decline gradually. There was an insufficient supply of high-count yarn in the market, but there were frequent searches for it from the weaving industry. The market for high-count yarns, such as 42-count Jincheng and 32-count Yinyue, remained steady to slightly positive. 21-count Shuangma was priced as low as 745 yuan, but with some small purchases, it eventually recovered slightly, but the final result was a decrease of 18 yuan compared to before the festival. There was an abundant supply of yarns below 20 counts, and the trend was also good. The market was stable, with 586 pieces traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth sales were slow because export measures were temporarily suspended, causing export sales to stagnate. Buyers stopped buying and started selling. In addition, the authorities were strictly auditing account books, warehouse receipts, and warehouses. Furthermore, because the Textile and Construction Company (紡建公司) was selling high-end goods, the supply was plentiful, and the market was flooded. Various parties in the market became more willing to sell, and sellers became anxious, rushing to sell.</p>
<p>12-pound *longtou* (龍頭) fine cloth initially opened at just a little over 4 jiao (角), but then the prices went down again to 27.50 yuan due to the refusal of the number companies (號家) and dyeing factories, a sharp decline of 9 jiao compared to before the festival. Throughout the day, *sijunzi yuan biji* (四君子元嗶嘰) was the popular and well-selling item, with many buyers offering just 0.25 yuan. The prices of other cloths decreased by 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 yuan, but colored cloth and *shilin* (士林) cloth remained at their original levels. 1,180 *pi* (疋) were traded.</p>
<h3>Export Limited Prices Appropriately Increased to Meet Domestic and Foreign Market Needs</h3>
<p>The export limited prices announced and implemented by the Export Control Commission (輸管會) were originally set based on the actual situation of various export goods in the foreign market. It is understood that the Commission will appropriately increase the minimum prices for Keemun black tea, sesame cakes, and other items for the coming week (September 20th to 26th) It will also add minimum export prices for straw hats, shelled peanut cakes, and No. 5 new Keemun black tea specially sold to Australia. There will be no changes for other items such as hog bristles, pigskins, fur, wool, hair, feathers, straw hats, tea (excluding new Keemun black tea), and casings. The minimum F.O.B. US dollar prices for the above-mentioned amended goods for export are as follows: Straw hats (sold to Australia) $0.35 per dozen, sesame cakes $65 per long ton, shelled peanut cakes $65 per long ton, No. 1 new Keemun black tea $0.40 per pound, No. 2 new Keemun black tea $0.30 per pound, No. 3 new Keemun black tea $0.25 per pound, No. 4 new Keemun black tea $0.18 per pound, No. 5 new Keemun black tea $0.14 per pound.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Yarn and Cloth to be Transported South</h3>
<p>Since the ban on the export of yarn and cloth, the demand for yarn and cloth in various parts of South China, which has always relied on Shanghai for support, has suddenly decreased. There is currently a shortage of supply, which is causing high prices and affecting public sentiment. The Guangdong authorities previously telegraphed the China Textile Corporation (中紡公司), requesting that the company rush 200,000 *pi* (疋) of cloth and 2,000 pieces of yarn to Guangzhou to meet urgent needs. After receiving the telegram, the company presented this situation to Supervisor Jiang for approval. In principle, there is generally no problem. However, in order to avoid stimulating the calm prices in Shanghai, the China Textile Corporation has planned carefully in advance and is currently contacting all relevant parties to start transportation. As for the quantity of the first batch to be transported, it will depend on the tonnage of the ships contacted.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting in America Talks About Asian Games Welcomes Participation After Signing Peace Treaty with Japan First Asian Games Not Desired to Be Held in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, September 17th] Dr. Wang Zhengting, President of the Chinese Amateur Athletic Association and head of the Chinese delegation to the World Games, predicted on the 17th: "Once the peace treaty with Japan is signed, Japan will be welcomed to attend international sports competitions. The only obstacle for Japan to attend the planned 1950 Asian Games is the peace treaty with Japan, but it is hoped that it can be resolved by the 1952 World Games." Dr. Wang has a deep impression on Japan's recent amazing achievements in swimming competitions. Dr. Wang also said: "China does not intend to propose holding the 1950 Asian Games in China, because sports fields, hotels, and other facilities are lacking." Wang said: "China's performance in London was better than we expected. Due to the lack of competition and training opportunities during the recent ten years of war, we did not hope for any amazing performances in London. Holding the National Games in mid-May was an expedient measure. We believe that the athletes with the most training and practice opportunities performed the best, such as the athletes from the mountainous areas of the former Free China, whose performance was the worst, those from the war-torn areas were mediocre, and the overseas Chinese were the best." Wang also said: "We gained a lot of experience in London, and we are very proud of the spirit of the long-distance runner Lou Wen'ao. Lou ran to the tenth lap in the 10,000-meter long-distance race, and his feet were bleeding, but he still finished the last fifteen laps. This kind of spirit deserves to be promoted to the world." Wang concluded: "He believes that the World Games football competition should adopt a 'best-of-three-games' system, and should not be a 'knockout tournament.' China will propose this suggestion to the International Football Association."</p>

<h3>The Dreadfulness of Wives</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>A few rattan chairs have been added to the teachers' lounge. This is the school authorities' kind intention, knowing that teachers are always thirsty and tired after class. Sitting in these chairs, drinking a glass of water, and relaxing can restore their spirits. With these chairs, the room is brand new, which makes people like it. The head of the teaching group, who is supposed to take care of it at any time, often goes in, and the general affairs officer, who purchased these appliances, also often sits there. During class time, the teachers are all in the classrooms. At this time, the head of the teaching group and the general affairs officer meet unexpectedly and sit there chatting.</p>
<p>"Front door brand cigarettes," the general affairs officer said, taking a puff of the cigarette and pinching the butt, "These two days there are cheap ones to buy; it is said that they were confiscated from hoarders who refused to sell them, and the police confiscated them and sold them at a flat price. It's a pity that the money hasn't been issued yet, so I can't buy a few packs. Actually, it would be nice if I could buy one pack."</p>
<p>The cigarette butt was very short and was about to burn the fingers that were pinching it, and it seemed like he wanted to throw it away. But a quick glance made him feel that he could barely take another puff. He cupped his hand and took a deep puff, and then quickly threw it diagonally into the waste bin, making a "hiss" sound.</p>
<p>"There is still no news about the new salary," the head of the teaching group echoed, "A pack of cigarettes is a small matter; I have two children to register, and the deadline has already passed. I don't know what to do. For the sake of the children's tuition, I try my best to save money during the holidays as usual. But the accumulation is not much. With miscellaneous expenses, there is still a shortage of rice. One hundred and eighty catties each, three hundred and sixty catties, will cost one hundred and fifty million. I was hoping that last month's salary could be issued on time."</p>
<p>Every time there is an adjustment, the salary is usually delayed because the forms have to be transferred back and forth for verification. Before the adjustment, prices always rise sharply, and everyone uses up their money waiting for their salary; the salary always happens to be delayed. This time it is the conversion to gold yuan, and it is also the time when schools are starting.</p>
<p>Therefore, Director Sun has even taken off his ring from his finger to exchange it for his younger brother's tuition. Like you, who don't have children studying in secondary schools, you can be a little more relaxed.</p>
<p>"How can I be relaxed? Paying fees in elementary school also costs a lot. Seven or eight gold yuan is more than 20 million. Last month's salary, I only got more than 30 million. Oil, salt, firewood, and rice, the so-called seven necessities, are needed every day. These two days, the cigarettes I smoke are borrowed from the stalls at the school gate, one pack at a time. If I can't get the money, I don't dare to go home. Haha! Now I am afraid of my wife. I am so afraid of my wife that I don't even dare to go home!"</p>
<p>"Is your wife quite fierce?"</p>
<p>"My wife is usually easy to talk to. As long as there is oil, salt, firewood, and rice, she doesn't care about anything else. I didn't have to make her afraid of me, and I didn't need to be afraid of her. Now going back is terrible; no matter what, when I go in and meet her, as soon as she asks if the salary has arrived, I am terrified. Saying that the rice is already eaten, the firewood needs to be bought, and the oil and salt are also gone. I can't deal with it, so I have no choice but not to go back and let her borrow from the east and drag from the west. It's easier for her to borrow a little when I'm not at home. But it always has to be paid back; so the more days pass, the more I dare not go back, and my wife's face becomes more and more terrible."</p>
<p>"Yes," he mentioned the oil, salt, firewood, and rice. If there is no money to buy them, the wife becomes terrible. How much does the grocery store owe, how many millions does the rice store owe, how many millions does the tofu cost, and how many millions does the oil cost, all of which are still owed to the stores. She rambles on from afar and wants to bring up all this to me. I find her terrible, so I haven't gone home for many days.</p>
<p>A thin, tall man with glasses, who teaches history and geography, suddenly came in. As soon as the head of the teaching group saw him, he greeted him. "Mr. Zhao, do you have class next period?"</p>
<p>"I already taught my class this morning," Mr. Zhao replied, "I don't have class this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Then why haven't you gone home yet?" the head of the education group asked.</p>
<p>This question elicited Mr. Zhao's complaints. He sat down and opened his mouth. "Going home, I haven't been able to go home for a whole week. I have a home but can't return, because I'm afraid to see my wife's face. Hmm! She doesn't speak, but her tightly furrowed brows are always there to indicate: the rice is eaten, the firewood needs to be bought. She is waiting for me to go back and solve it, hoping that I will go back sooner. Just now I inquired with Accountant Wang, and there is still no news about the salary. I翻 through the newspapers, and I can't find any clue. What's the point of going back empty-handed?"</p>
<p>Smiling bitterly, the head of the teaching group and the general affairs officer looked at each other.</p>
<p>"When I was in the military in the past," Mr. Zhao continued, "I once heard a sergeant say that he only went home once a month, on the evening of the day he was paid. Because there was little money, he said that he had married a wife and couldn't go home often, as if he were going to Gongchen Bridge (note). At that time, I only found it ridiculous; now I deeply understand his sadness."</p>
<p>"Then everyone is the same," the head of the education group said softly, "Everyone is in this situation."</p>
<p>"We," the general affairs officer stuck out his tongue and interjected, "are all afraid of our wives!"</p>
<p>"Yes," Mr. Zhao said loudly and solemnly, "I am also afraid of my wife; now, the wife is so terrible!"</p>
<p>[Note: Gongchen Bridge was formerly a commercial port and the location of public prostitutes.]</p>
<h3>Three Recent Poems</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Sent to Ye Yuhu's Appreciation of Literature</p>
<p>When will the war end and all directions be clear? The society is startled by wind, rain, and dust! Old Xu Jun's loyalty shines, The lungs and intestines of the poet Jia Dao are poured out (At the age of fifty, I received the five-tone ancient poem). The beard and eyebrows are white and unpretentious, The children's feelings are easy to get. Fifty-four years have passed in a dream, You should pity me for not returning to farming.</p>
<p>Transmitted on Logging and Suppressing Communists in Siming Mountain</p>
<p>The sound of hometown echoes thousands of miles again in the autumn wind, The sound of logging startles the sleepy old man; I remember that I once stayed briefly in Siming, The frost burns the maple leaves, and the mountain is red.</p>
<p>Thoughts on Late Autumn</p>
<p>The traveler's clothes are half bathed in the setting sun, The autumn wind blows cool in the country, The setting sun points to the distant green mountains, The withered grass feels cold in the white hair; After the Qin fire, the eastern mansion is desolate, The setting sun shines on Yue City beside the western window, When will I return to plan for my family, Rebuild the garden and count the halls?</p>
<h3>Thirty-Four</h3>
<p>— Tiao Ying</p>
<p>This is a true story.</p>
<p>A few years ago, an old gambler walked into a casino in a city in the western United States. He sat down at the roulette table and took out some chips, betting on "thirty-four."</p>
<p>The roulette wheel turned and slowly stopped. The casino clerk said, "Thirty-four. Sir, this is yours." He put the old man's money on "thirty-four" on the roulette wheel.</p>
<p>The old man didn't move. The roulette wheel turned again, and when it stopped, it was "thirty-four" again. The casino clerk looked at the old gambler uneasily, but the old man still didn't say anything, his finger still pointing at "thirty-four."</p>
<p>The roulette wheel turned and stopped, and it was "thirty-four" three times in a row.</p>
<p>At that time, many people gathered around to watch, and everyone was a little surprised. However, the old man still remained calm.</p>
<p>"Thirty-four" came out five times in a row. At that time, the clerk came out to say hello, and he said politely, "Ladies and gentlemen, we are very sorry, we will have to suspend here for the time being." He faced the old man and said, "Old sir, congratulations, please take your money--"</p>
<p>But he suddenly turned pale and couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>It wasn't until that moment that he remembered that the old man had not only never said a word since the first round, but had not even moved at all. On closer inspection, the gambling master had already passed away.</p>
<h3>On Writing Fees</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tui</p>
<p>The example of writers receiving fees for their writing has been recorded in Yong Rong Zhai's notes. It existed as early as the Jin Dynasty, but flourished in the Tang Dynasty. Li Bei Hai (Yong) received gifts worth millions for his writings. Pei Du commissioned Huangfu Shi to write the Fu Xian Temple Stele and gave him many carriages, horses, silk, and brocade, but he was still not satisfied and added a reward of 9,000 bolts of silk. Bai Juyi and Yuan Zhen were close friends. After Yuan passed away, Bai Juyi wrote his epitaph and still received saddles, horses, silk, brocade, and jade belts as thanks, worth more than six or seventy hundred thousand. Liu Mengde Changli wrote: "The price of one word from Yan Yigong is like a mountain of gold." Those who despised it at the time called it flattery for the tomb. This trend slightly subsided after the Song Dynasty. Jie'an Manbi wrote: "Someone asked Sang Min to write an article, entrusting it to kinship, but was stingy and did not give a fee. Sang said: 'I have never written an article for free in my life. You can temporarily place a silver ingot on my desk to encourage and inspire me. After the article is finished, return the ingot along with the article.' This can be called strange."</p>
<p>Tang Bohu had a huge book recording the articles he wrote for people, and he titled it "Lucky Money." When Ma Huaizu, a contemporary, asked Zhu Zhishan to write an article, Zhu asked: "Is there a glimpse of spirit?" This is because in the Wu dialect, silver coins are called "spirit." Ma replied: "There is a glimpse of spirit." Zhu then happily picked up his pen. Chen Baisha was good at painting, and those who sought his work wore out his doorstep. Baisha jokingly wrote on the side of his seat: "The crow-sound people are here again." People did not understand and asked about its meaning. Chen said: "White waste—white painting—" Everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Yuan Zicai would not produce poetry or prose without money. In his later years, he became wealthy and reclusive, living a luxurious life. The money for managing the Sui Garden and indulging in pleasure was all obtained from his flourishing pen. Yu Quyuan also had a set fee: 50 taels of silver for articles within 1,000 characters, and double for those over 1,000, and he also had a poem: "The price of the inscription on the Duke Gong stele is not cheap. How can I, with my humble knowledge, be suitable? Only because I occupy the seat of a famous mountain, people scramble to ask for the words of the lower classes. Dare to be tired of asking again and again, but because I am seventy and my strength is declining. Although the scholars laugh at me for being foolish, they may understand this intention." Lin Qinnan also imitated Yu's example and set a writing fee rate and prefaced it with a poem: "Relatives and orphans are waiting to be fed, what can this mountain man do? I don't increase the painting fee to seek a share, what's the point of sitting and listening to the cold discussion?" After this, it became a trend.</p>
<p>Although the fee poems each have different intentions, the main thing is to judge based on the person's mind and demeanor. However, upon closer examination of their tone, there is not much difference. It is generally difficult for scholars to achieve prominence, and they often like to use this opportunity to vent their full of complaints. Given this great opportunity, how could they easily let it go? Therefore, it is rare to see someone who can find peace of mind and get rid of their anger in this. There are even those who are extremely sharp and self-righteous, such as Xu Zhiling's poem: "I have wasted twenty years at sea, drunkenly leaning back and sitting in the blue sky. The rabbit hair is exhausted and my body is old, in exchange for selling rhetoric in the world!" Scolding the empty air, as if hearing his words, as if seeing the person.</p>
<p>The Buying-Writing Yuefu written by Guo Shoujing of Weitan is an extreme display of mockery. Its words say: "I can't be a bandit or a robber when I'm big, and I can't be a thief or a pickpocket when I'm small. Scholars are born in this world, and they are destined to rest. What kind of poverty do you suffer, what kind of attention do you draw! (First verse) My wife can't be sold to charm, and my son doesn't know how to gain power. A bald pen is worth my life. Why put on a stinky front, inviting laughter and scolding! (Second verse) My wife can't be sold to charm, and my son doesn't know how to gain power. A bald pen is connected to my life. There's nothing new, it's for the sake of money. (Third verse) I can't be a traditional celebrity, and I can't associate with fashionable politicians. Without a signboard, who would recognize me! What's black and white, issue a writing fee! (Fourth verse)" The world is playing, the训 is with thorns, just this one end, it is enough to be poor all his life.</p>
<p>Zheng Banqiao's fee poem is the originator of this way. The predecessors still had some embellishments, but Zheng was straightforward and didn't hide anything. He didn't doubt it and established the bold style of "No matter relatives or friends, no exceptions, please don't open your mouth, the gentleman is self-disciplined," which is enough to make hypocrites stutter. "Sending gifts is better than sending silver, with money you are a hundred times more energetic, both writing and painting are good." There is not a single word that is not wonderful. This kind of shylock tone, expressed in a straightforward way, does not need to be polite and entrust, is to say what people dare not say, to do what people dare not do, how can etiquette be set for us! A quick person, a quick thing, worthy of being a running dog under Xu Qingeng's door.</p>
<h3>East Scale West Claw</h3>

<p>The first successful blood transfusion was in 1667, performed by the surgeon of King Louis XIV of France, in Beli Mountain. He transfused lamb's blood to the boy. It was not until the discovery of blood types in 1900 (discovered by Dr. Landsteiner) that the application of human blood transfusions became popular.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the American Academy, there are as many as 3,170 dialects in the world. In Europe alone, there are more than 900 completely different dialects.</p>
<p>The smallest book in the world is a Bible housed in the round book collection of St. Paul's Cathedral in England. Its length, width, and height are all one inch, and the entire text is printed with specially made typefaces.</p>
<p>The largest butterfly in the world is produced near the Amazon River in South America, with a wingspan of more than three feet. The largest mosquito in the world is displayed in the British Museum and is two and a half inches long.</p>
<p>The bride's veil originated in the Greek and Roman eras, and its purpose was to protect the bride from the harm of evil spirits.</p>
<p>The tallest building in the world is the Empire State Building in New York. Iron alone used 58,000 tons during construction, and the four central columns alone weighed 10 million pounds (5,000 tons). This building has a total of 62 express elevators.</p>
<h3>Capitalized Numbers</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>The numbers from one to ten in our country are very easy to alter because their strokes are too simple. Therefore, there are capitalized numbers, such as 壹, 貳, 叁, etc., to replace them. Like today's use of checks, capitalized numbers are required, which has become a convention. According to ancient books, 壹 and 一, 貳 and 二 have the same pronunciation and meaning. Like Mao Shi Guan Jiu Xu Yun: "To satirize the lack of 壹也"; and Yun: "The lack of 壹也 in intention"; and the main text says: "Its ceremony is 一也." This is that 一 and 壹 are used interchangeably. Mencius Shen Nong's words "Following Xu Zi's way, the market price will not 貳," shows that 二 and 貳 were already used interchangeably during the Warring States period. The word 叁 is not found in dictionaries, it is a slight change of the word "參"; but ancient books used the word 參 to replace the word 三, like Yi Jin Ci Yun: "叁 days two lands one"; Shi Wen Yun: "參, seven nan fan, also like a word, sounds like san." The so-called "like a word" means that "叁" can also be written as "參." Also, Zhou Li "Set its 參," note that "卿三人." These can all be used to prove that 參 replaces 三.</p>
<p>The five capitalized characters 肆, 伍, 陸, 玖, 拾 and the five lowercase characters 四, 五, etc. have the same sound but completely different meanings. Like 肆 is a verb, used to mean "Chen," see Mao Shi Xing Zhang Zhang "Or 肆之筵" sentence note. 伍 is a collective noun, five people are "伍," see Zhou Li Xiao Situ "Meeting its ten 伍 and teaching the way and art" sentence note. 陸 is also a noun, Gao Ping calls it one 陸, see Zhou Yi "Gradually on 陸" sentence note. 玖 is also a noun, Shuo Wen Yun: The jade of stone is black, the poem says: "一贻我佩玖," then 拾呢, Shuo Wen Yun: Pick up, from the hand, combined sound. 一故 is a verb. There are also obscure meanings found in the scriptures, which will not be listed again.</p>
<p>Among the capitalized numbers, the character 捌 is not found in the classics! According to Ji Jiu Yun: "農器也," is also a noun; but what shape is this "捌," it is no longer possible to examine, so it can be allowed to always replace "八"下去.</p>
<p>There is also a character 柒, which is also not found in the classics. The oldest way to replace seven is with "漆," which can be proved by the words "Zhou Gong Xi sees paint ten scholars." According to the paint itself is the name of a tree, Mao Shi "Mountain has paint." Paint can also be written as "桼." Later there was also the use of "桼" to replace seven, see Shu Xi Bing Fu: "In the morning, the nine tripods are offered, and in the evening, the house of Nai E is lodged." This word is the 省笔 of "桼." The "柒" character currently in use first appears in Shan Hai Jing "Gang Shan has many 柒 trees," this 柒 is originally the lacquer tree, so the character 柒 or 字的俗写.</p>
