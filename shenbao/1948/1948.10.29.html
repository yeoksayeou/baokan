<h3>對出售滬敵偽房產　糾正案原則成立　監院兩委會推三委員草擬案文</h3>

<h3>上海市的戶口普查</h3>
<p>上海市政府與經濟督導負辦公團，爲換發國民身份證及配購證，以便下月起實施全面配給配購起見，已決定於下月八日，舉行全市戶口總淸查，並頒佈實施綱要，通吿市民注意三項：（一）淸査時，全戶人口一律集在戶內，保特靜止狀態，由淸査員逐戶按人對照，當塲將新發之國民身份證照片上蓋印，按名發給。（二）市民如尙未領有身份證者，須事先塡就請領國民身份證聲請書，加貼照片兩張；如尙朱聲請戶籍登記者，須先塡遷入戶籍登記聲請書。（三）戶口淸査，以甲爲淸査基本單位，每甲設淸査員二人，全市共需五萬六千人，當局將動員七萬公敎人員聲學生協助辦理。由此足見上海市這次舉行的戶口總淸查，其規模之大，動員之廣，在我國近代戶政上尙屬創舉。</p>
<p>戶口總淸査，應稱爲戶口普査，其意義在調査某指定時刻內之靜態戶口；所得的統計，應稱爲戶口靜態統計。這是社會學統計學用於實際政治的一種措施，一般進步國家和善良公民是非常重視這項措施的。惟人口普査與戶籍行政略有不同。戶籍行政是紀載戶口動態，應屬於戶籍法的範圍。這次上海市舉行的戶口普査，其目的係依靜態戶口統計，按戶計口核發「國民身份證」，而身份證又是公證人民的屬籍和身份，以爲證明個人權利的保障和義務的確定。「國民身份證」的法律根據爲新戶籍法。所以這次上海市的人口普査，在技術上是普査全市某一指定時刻內之靜慈人口，然後依靜態統計，照戶籍法上的規定，按戶計口發給新的「國民身份證」。其手續芝繁難，需要耐心的細緻的去作，庶幾不致發生錯誤；尤其進行普査時，必需要合法律，合學理，單純的注意到人口普査這一點，而絲毫不涉及其他，方可以避免苛擾，方可以爲「新政」留一較好印象於民間，方可期其在效用上不致發生扞格。這是很重要的一件事。</p>
<p>我國在抗戰期間，昆明市會辦理一次不範性的戶口調査，重慶市也曾試辦一次身份登記調查，按全市人口核發「居民身份登記證」，此卽現在國民身份證之前身。當年昆明重慶兩市的辦理經驗，宜可作爲這次上海戶口普査的參考。昆明市的戶口調查，學術意義重於行政意義，它於調查之先，動員全市小學敎員接受戶口調查訓練，然後以之充作調查員，從事調查工作。昆明市的調査，有三點値得注意：第一，它將全市劃分爲一五〇調査區，並有監察員進行抽査；第二，先調査普通戶，再集中力量調査公共戶（如學校機關軍隊），第三，宣傳良好，市民甚少誤解。重慶市的身份登記，則行政意義重於學術意義。設立專門機關動員大批軍警根據頗屬繁多的調査表格，於半年內方始辦理完竣。從嚴密上說，重慶市的登記調査，合乎嚴密效用的；從經濟上說，重慶市實在是浪費的。這次上海市舉辦人口普査，積極目的是便利配給配購，眸間迫切，籌備倉卒，我們希望在不浪費的原則上做到嚴密，在迅速時間上做到確實而普遍。並且希望全市市良，對於這項具有自身權利義務攸關的事，熱心贊助，予以支持，不要誤解，轉生風波。這是很重要的。</p>
<p>上海市的戶口普査，業已定期爲十一月八日下午九時起至九日上午一時止舉行。在這短促的籌備期問，希望有關機關的凖備工作，要認眞細心體察。在法律上，技術上，戶口普査部份，應依「人口普査法」之所定，因時因地制宜運用；核發國民身份證部份，應依「戶籍法」有關身份登記之所定，特別注重人身籍貫年齡職葉，藉此一身份證之頒行，能有公證個人身份之效用，從而保障個人權利，確定個人義務。最後希望調査人員，進行調査時，特別耐勞謙和，切勿擾民，俾市民發生信仰。至於外傳所謂附帶調査「地下倉庫」這種夾七總八的做法，是萬萬行不得的。因爲一般進步國家均以戶口普査爲敎育上的課題，藉此以訓練人民的遵守法律，故必須先從執行調查人員自己嚴格守法起。昔年印度舉行人口普査時，就充分達到人民自治敎育底目的。上海市五百萬市民，知識水準較高，無論普通戶，公共戶，均應熱心贊助，協助政府，完成這一件富有時代敎育意義的偉大工作，以爲全國戶籍之示範。而負責調査的七萬人員，尤其身繋推行新政能否順利有效之責任，需要特別謙謹耐勞，以樹立政治的新作風。這是我們對這次上海市戶口普査的最大願望。</p>

<h3>王外長談中英關係</h3>
<p>深信戡亂不致分裂中國</p>
<p>〔中央社倫數廿七日電〕我外長王世木杰抵此前夕，泰晤士報曾以半欄之篇幅發表其駐聯合國訪員訪問王氏之長篇報導，內稱：王氏自戰時率領中國訪英國訪英後，卽異常關切英國之建設問題，現在並預料中英貿易有極偉大之前途。王氏曾謂：英國之經濟復興及英政府對於亞洲人民所表現之政治，其風度已在中國留有極佳印象。目前留華之英人，較中英關係史上任何時間留華之英人更能獲得好感。就經濟方面而言，在華出售之品質優良之英國商品價格，較來自他地者爲低。就政治方面而論，英國政府在過去三四年中之各種行動，不僅在中國知識份子及商人間，且在中國之大部份人民間，留有深刻印象。王氏繼論及中國之問題，並要求西方人士改正渠等以爲中國將自現在反共鬥爭中分裂爲兩個國家之錯誤觀念。王氏表示，渠個人深信中國將不致分裂。王氏稱：爲東北問題與日太衝突十三年後，中國人民之國家觀念已異常强烈，渠不相信共產主義能壓制此種觀念，並謂，中國人民之個性及傳統，使共產主義在中國人民心中生根一點，爲一極端困難之事，反之，中國人民在共黨控制區內所遭受之待遇，使渠等自動反對共產主義。自共黨區內，被迫出亡之數十萬中國人民，正開始自動組織，藉能打回故里，此項運動正在迅速擴張中。王氏認爲中國共黨理論與西歐共黨理論並無不同之處，並相信不僅東方共黨之暴動彼此間相互有關，且此種種暴動與西方之罷工亦密切有關，所有共黨行動均非偶然，而將助成一大攻勢，此種情况必須予以阻止。西歐方面穩固而迅速之復興，對於中國之戡亂將有重大影響此固毫無疑問也。</p>

<h3>克利扶蘭招待記者檢討經合援華工作　協助中國人民改進生活狀況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美經合總署對華設計處處長克利扶蘭，來華視察分署工作情形，已將四週。昨日上午，克氏假本市華懋飯店，舉行首次記者招待會。總署工業建設及配件調査團團長司徒立門，及此間分署代理署長葛里芬均出席。克氏於發表渠之書面談話後，答記者問曰：「經合總署現有對華之各項援助計劃，不致因目前中國國內局勢之轉移，而將考慮延緩或變更。在中國政府現時管轄之區械內，仍當儘量推進美援工作。」</p>
<p>克氏又稱：「迄目前爲止，經合署並未與中國之地方政府或當局進行任何直接之洽談，一切仍集中與中國之中央政府接觸。」</p>
<p>司徒立門於答覆記者問時稱：（一）潘陽電力廠之復興款項，刻尙未劃撥，該廠亦尙未聘就工程師，惟該廠復興計劃，決仍照預定步驟進行。（二）經合署擬在華採辦之銻，鎢及錫等，刻正調査其可能之供應量及價格。</p>
<p>茲再探誌克利扶蘭之談話撮要如次：</p>
<p>努力推進工作目標</p>
<p>克氏在會上指出，規定用以採購商品之二〇四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元中，已有半救處理妥貼，約有一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元之商品，業已抵達中國。渠稱，在工業方面曾有七〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元規定作爲配件與建設計劃之用，其中已有六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，處理妥貼，此外尙有二七五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元係供農村建設之用者。按美國會共撥定二七五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，供經合總署在一年之時期內進行援華工作。</p>
<p>克氏在過去四星期在中國視察經合署之種種活動，力言經合署方面刻正作每一努力，以謀推進其在華之工作目標，此即「經由中國政府竭盡所能幫助中國人民改着其生活，並使中國人民能爲其本身，形成一種處境，俾在其中生活與工作」。</p>
<p>吾人深信所有計劃及在運用方面所立之控制辦法，皆爲使經合署之款項在下列用途上得到最高之價値，援助中國之人民與各種機構，並支持中國政府增加生產興穩定經濟狀况，惟現在中國之情形，殊使吾人不能僅以直接受援人所得之褊狹效果，作爲衡量經合署計劃進程之準則，再者其運帶之效果——即經合署之全部貢獻與其他增進全盤局面之因素——則更多鼓勵之處。</p>
<p>援助計劃兩點原則</p>
<p>充其極，一種援助計劃祗能在其受命援之國家產生微小的效果，因此吾人於執行援華計劃時特別堅持下列兩點原則：</p>
<p>（一）與援助計劃有關之物價與計算率務須現實化，配售之實物須以市况規定之價格出售，棉織品與石油產品，亦同此例，此項原則並應用於煤斤電力或任何其他企業之直接間接受經合署之援助者，要知援助計劃與津貼計劃固有不同也。</p>
<p>（二）經合署爲使中國人民普遍受到援助計劃之裨益起見，務使其援助作爲中國政府從事生產與供應物資上之補助而非代替品，此即賴樸翰氏屢次强調之「自助原則」也。</p>
<p>經合署援華計劃之命運，自當視中國現局發展之結果爲轉移，吾人援華之宗旨，迄爲經由中國政府協助中國人民，依任何可能之途徑，改進其生活狀况，並助成其造就生存與工作之環境。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紙業公會理事長詹沛霖曁其弟詹雨田，前因有囤積居奇行爲，被警局經濟警察大隊拘捕，移送特種刑庭究辦，該案業經朱誠檢察官偵查終結，於昨日提起公訴，茲探錄起訴書原文於後：「被吿詹沛霖開設益記興號紙店，幷兼上海市紙業公會理事長，囤積大量紙張，存儲自備倉庫。計（一）廣東路一三一弄二十一號三樓堆存各種紙張大小二千五百三十二件，（二）江西路一三五弄五號堆存各種紙張大小約一千一百三十件，（三）山東路一二七號門市部存有各種紙張大小約一千令，（四）廣東路一三七號復興銀行內存有白紙五百零四令，共計三千六百六十二件，又一千五百零四令，並代漢口路茂泰企業公司寄存紙張七百二十五件。被吿詹雨田開設益中造紙廠，囤積各種紙坯達八百七十筒，另有二百筒，存於交通倉庫，業經上海市警局經濟大隊調査屬實，除上項紙張飭令具結保管外，將被吿等逮捕轉送偵査到庭。</p>
<h3>所犯法條</h3>
<p>證據及所犯法條：被詹沛霖對於存貯上開紙張，自承不諱，惟堅稱並無囤積居奇行爲，但核被吿在偵訊中供稱，該項紙張均在勝利後購進，已有一二年云云，查勝利以還，由於不法商人投機牟利，囤積居奇，遂使物價動邊，一日千里，該被吿存儲大量紙張，不圖供應所需，其有違反政府對於日用品之管制，顯無疑義。被吿詹雨田雖稱該項原料，僅能供應三月，並無囤積行爲。但核閱經濟警察大隊査報該廠因受設備電力限制，每日僅能出紙十餘令，則上開貯存原料，遠超三月之數量，足資認定。核其行爲，依動員戡亂完成憲章實施綱要第六條，第十六條第一項，非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法第二條丁款，國家總動員法第七條規定，均應適用妨害國家總動員懲罰暫行條例第五條第一項第一款處罰。」</p>

<h3>外匯資產管理辦法　財部補充修正兩點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯資產持有人准許保留數歡，財部前曾訂有四項規定，並經公佈實施.頃悉財部復與外交部會同擬訂補充辦法兩點，呈准行政院備案，內容如次:</p>
<p>（一）中國政府派駐鼠外人員（包括國家銀行在內），自本年九月份起，每月所得薪給及特別辦公費，免予登記移存。</p>
<p>（二）旅居國外之中華民國人民，其外匯存款除照央行外幣外匯存款支付辦法辦理外，如遇保留額不敷支用或其他緊急正當需要，須支用其存款時，得由各駐外使領館核定後，由原支領銀行支付之。但主管本人提取存款之申請，應報經外交部核准，各館並應將核准案件列表二份，報外交部轉財部査核。</p>
<h3>錢莊增資事宜　財稅中允放寬良度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃悉：財政部電知中央銀行，關於錢商業同業公會全國聯合會，爲行莊調整資本，繳納交換保證金，及存欠利率問題所縷陳之意見，經核定辦法如下；</p>
<p>（甲）（一）各地區行莊最低資本額，應仍照原辦法規定，未便變更。</p>
<p>（二）增資期限，仍以兩個月爲限，但期限之開始，准依照法律施行日期條例之規定計算。</p>
<p>（三）增資現金全部份存儲中央銀行三個月之規定，仍應照原辦法辦理，將來各行莊如有正當用途請求不動用時，照規定之動用辦法辦理，其現金增資部份超過百分之五十者，其超過部份動用時由部從寬核定，上項存儲中央銀行之資金，並准予比照存款準備金給付利息，未設有中央銀行地方，由部份另商中央銀行辦理。</p>
<p>（四）（一）資產升値部份，在廿七年以後購置者，原定計算公式中之卅七年六月份全國蔓售物價指數，參照整理財政補充辦法第四項丙款之規定，改算至卅七年八月上半月爲止。（二）原請准股東以現金以外之資產抵充股款繳納，未便照准。（三）殘餘資產尙有價値可估時，照「商營銀行調整資本辦法解釋』規定辦理</p>

<h3>冰蛋出口業務全部陷於停頓</h3>
<p>昨據冰蛋業製造商方面消息，因八一九限價，各種物資均流入黑市，且雖出以高價，仍不能購到，鷄蛋每枚現已漲至二角，成本增高，無法出口，英倫曾屢向我國訂購冰蛋，並希望多多供應。惟英國對冰蛋每噸僅出英鎊二百十之貨價，折合我國金圓券爲二千五百餘元，但目前製造一噸冰蛋，全部成本需要五千元左右，若將冰蛋售與英倫，每噸虧本二千五百元之鉅，且政府又無法貼補，故我國目前之冰蛋榮，實已陷於整個停頓狀態云。</p>
<h3>資金南日多　總數達五百萬金圓</h3>
<p>已付貨款國外訂貨輸入淸理辦法公佈後，商人因格於國內之限價，仍多觀望而不輸入，惟近來議價之說甚囂塵上，一般商人又感興奮。另據熟習內情人士談稱：近來各大商號出售貨物以後，所獲金細累累，不能補進貨物，但改行議價之傳聞甚盛，市面實金乃大批南流，過去數日來，南去資金頓形轉旺，估計約篇五百萬金圓左右，一般揣測其去向有二，其一卽南去以後換成外幣，以保持幣値，其二爲在港澳訂購大批貨品，再行進口，良以現行之已付貨款國外訂貨輸入淸理辦法，雖限定爲八一九之訂貨，然商人前往香港等地購進貨品以後，仍可設法獲得八一九以前之發票，而可申請進口，此不但可保持幣値，且可獲利云。</p>
<h3>紡建開售棉布　申購者仍甚踴躍</h3>
<p>昨紡建公司循例開配棉布，計有十二磅龍頭B字細布，每疋價廿五元九角。又金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰，每疋廿七元六角。二等品印花色頂十八元八角，均限（門市）請購。又二等品卅碼嗶幾坏，每疋廿三元八角，限（染廠）申購。另有美布〇一三印花布，每公尺一元一角·又〇一二印條府綢，每公尺一元四角。又〇一四—一一印格斜紋，每公尺一元五角，均限（門市）申購。並有棉毛衫褲建國蔴紗等，請購者甚衆。</p>
<p>又訊：棉布公會代理染識業第四期第二批配布，總額僅有九千八百六十疋，申請配購者有一千三百四十三戶，每戶得配十疋，其不足之數，配戶仍以抽籤方式淘汰，故本期獲得配布之號家，計九百八十六戶，內有不合請購規定致受退單者十戶，另有三百四千七戶爲抽籤淘汰，下期配布則有優先承配權利。</p>
<h3>蠶農以秋繭繅土絲收購工作殊難展開</h3>
<p>本年秋季兩浙秋繭收購，因當局定價太低，一般靈農均一以不足成本，多繅作土絲，以過去舊法總成成品出售後，較之售與政府，仍可獲得理想之利潤，因之本年秋滿收購工作，並不如理想之美滿。</p>
<p>又據絲工業界擭悉，現世界生絲供給轉疏，英美法等團雖俱希望我國增加出口量，無如還價過低，而國內各地物價俱有上擔之勢，而各廠家承配原料甚少，目前每日購進柴米油豐籌措負工伙食已感不易，無力戰出，故絲織品外銷驟難看好。</p>
<h3>食米到貨略增　門售擁擠不堪</h3>
<p>食米到貨略增，南北二市塲共計到貨二千二百零九石，內南市塲到一千二百七十六石，北市塲到九百三十三石，到貨中以秈米居多，市上雖無交易，市塲報價仍未變動。米店門售擠軋特甚，故雖略有應市，旋卽一購而空。</p>
<p>雜糧交易，完全停頓。黄金仍不配出。存貨貨主希望先換工業品，卽至產區交換黄豆來滬。</p>
<h3>茶市靜中帶堅</h3>
<p>交易久狹之紅綠茶，昨日市上依然未見復甦，原因爲自執戶鑒於產區貨稀價俏，又以複製箱茶之一切附屬原料，淮購益形困難，故態度更萌不忍割愛，供應遂轉渺茫，而貿方雖仍前來，頻思染指，卒吿片葉難覓，過程難以明朗，市氣則靜中帶堅。茲據本市店莊消息：自太市發生搶購風潮以來，各業均感不敷需求，茶葉亦不例外，因此目前各店號俱擬添納，以應門售。</p>
<h3>銀根緊俏　暗息高昂罕見</h3>
<p>昨日市間銀根，仍呈緊俏，綠月底即屆，市塲需要殷切之故，市塲利率，挺至二角七分，最高見高出三角關外，殊爲改革幣制以來所僅見。業內行莊多見缺單，週轉十分困難。</p>
<h3>補貼農民損失購棉搭發紗布</h3>
<p>關於產區棉農不願依照限價出售原棉，而自紡土紗一事，本市棉紡業對此，頗爲注意。頃自團棉聯購處方面獲悉：該處對此，業已埰取有效對策，以免影巒原棉收購，是項對策，除於收購價類中，搭發紗布，以增加棉農利潤外，並將電請各地政府協助勸導。據該處人士表示：棉農之所以不願按規定價格出售原棉，全係收購價格與當地日用品價格距離過遠所致，故今後埰取部份物物交換後，情形卽可好轉。</p>
<h3>本週人絲暫停配中信局維持限價</h3>
<p>中信局意大利易貨人造絲，已陸續運到四千四百箱，一部報關手續，尙未辦妥，本週暫時停配。預定廿七日配出之二百四十箱，亦改於卞次配出。至配售價格，據該局負責人表示，配價決維持八一九限價，廠商所製成之成品，亦應按限價批售，各承銷商店亦無漲價理由。至市塲所發生之黑市，非本局權力所及，希主管當局加以取締。又意人絲二千二百箱，廿九日即可到埠。</p>
<p>又訊：生絲市塲，國外消沉，每磅仍在美金三元左右盤旋，國丙暗潮迭起，每担折合金圓一千五百三十元，而實際成本，在兩千以上，黑市超過實際成本一倍，故生絲出口，極爲困難，外銷業務，已吿停頓，據業中權威談：冬季國外需我生絲較爲股切，彼時必轉堅俏，前途仍可樂觀。</p>

<h3>菱湖建設</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿六傳訊〕浙省主席陳公洽氏對菱湖的民衆說：「菱湖現在建設的路向是對的，希望好好的持續下去，成爲浙江省的模範。」</p>
<p>菱湖是吳興縣屬的一個市鎭，在舊時行政制度上，在牠的周圍十四個鄕鎭，都屬牠管轄，稱爲菱湖區，全區面積約二百二十五方公里，人口達十二萬餘，水道縱横，河流交織，人民多以業農爲務，蠶絲爲最主要生產物。抗戰前，全區桑地總面積達五萬畝以上，栽桑總數達一千五百餘萬枝，在民十五年前，土絲總量可達八千祖左右，另如魚菱，羊毛也是大宗的出產。抗戰軍興，菱湖因爲水道的地形有利，所以成了游擎鬥爭最劇烈的塲所，農村生產萎縮，鎭上商業一蹶不振，市鎭房屋，半燬砲火。人口銳减，菱湖鎭僅有八千多人民。</p>
<p>新的開始</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，上海菱湖同鄉潘公展氏有志復興家鄉，在上海實業人士章榮初氏的努力之下，於是使這小小的菱湖復蘇了起來。</p>
<p>菱湖開始新的建設，是在卅五年的十月，他們先在上海成立了一個菱湖建設協會。然後由章榮初氏出資建造工廠學校等大規模的新型房舍，開始經營各種事業。</p>
<p>關於農業部門，卅五年由該會購辦桑苗七十萬株，無條件贈與農友，代辦改良蠶種。三十五年一萬四千張完全贈送，秋期六千張也完全贈送。卅六年春期二萬五千張，酌收成本。秋期五千張，完全贈送。卅七年春期六萬張，酌收成本，秋期一萬三千張，依成本以七折優待。爲了扶助貧農，還舉辦了貸蠶種，貸款，貸米，又派負免費指導共同催青，稚蠶共育等。</p>
<p>魚業部門</p>
<p>關於魚業部門，成立了菱湖區養魚生產改進會，下轄十三分會，會員由五百人已增至一千三百餘人，並且與中國農民銀行低利洽辦貸款，法幣十三萬萬元，與中央水產實驗所免息洽辦貸款法幣十八萬萬元。又集體採運魚苗的方法大量採購魚苗。對於養魚技術，由中央水產實驗所派以會同該會加強改進的指導，由於低利貸款與硏究指導，所以產量劇增，卅四年運銷外埠的成魚五萬尾，而卅六年已達十三萬七千四百九十八尾，最近又運到魚秧七千萬尾。關於農田水利部門，修理圩埂計二十八處，設立稻作試驗塲一所，購買小型抽水機二十部。關於工業部門，菱湖繅絲廠，計有二百五十開羅瓦特的電力，除供給繅絲廠應用外，並供應全鎭的電燈。另有化學酸製造炭酸鈣，用白煤與洞庭山的嫩石，出品爲紅吉牌澱沉炭酸鈣，供製造化妝品藥品等原料之用。另有藍吉牌，供製造橡膠，造紙，油漆，油墨等原料之用，月產五千包，運銷上海，香港，澳門，廣州等地，職工有一百七十五人。</p>
<p>繅絲廠況</p>
<p>繼絲廠始於本年六月開辦，現有設備，包括鍋鑪三只，千葉式烘　機一架，立繼繼絲車四〇八台，鮮繭來源卽爲該會所供應的蠢種，在春夏秋三期由廠自款收購。卅七年秋期起，實施倡導農民以鮮繭易取廠絲的代繅辦法，以期革除繅製土絲。目前每日產量約爲八祖，不過現在菱湖農胞，尙多格於舊習，仍自製土絲，不肯以繭易取廠絲，所以該廠或不能全年開工，因全年開工，以十一個月計，需鮮繭二萬六千餘市担。該廠於是又有將土絲改爲廠絲的計劃，刻正試騐實施中。該廠職工計有一千〇九人。</p>
<p>農塲等等</p>
<p>另有石粉廠，規模較小，爲將白石磨成白粉，供輾米及製造化妝品之用，現日產二十餘噸，關於敎育部門，設有靑樹中學，敎職員五十餘人，中學部學生一百二十二人，小學部學生一千零八十四人，所有學生一律免除學費。學校基金有池田六百畝和吳興縣銀行設款，意榮初的每月捐助。其他如農塲，醫院等，也有設置。農塲全面積七百四十餘畝，職工四十二人，太養猪三百餘頭，惜因猪瘟，養護不得其法而遭死亡，其他的事業都在試辦中。醫院爲臨時的，永久性的靑樹醫院正建造房屋中。據章榮初氏表示：他還想改善市政的街道，原想先建房屋一部份，把舊街店戶遙往，再把街道拆寬築成馬路新型房屋後遷返。不過，這件事地方上有些人不大表示同意，所以還在研究進行中。另有菱湖靈山公園爲唐冠王女士設計，現正興築中。</p>
<p>克服阻力</p>
<p>我們到菱湖半日，看見高大而寬敞新型的工廠學校房舍，使我們佩服努力建設者的精神。而建設者先自改善農村生活，改進農村經濟情形着手，再進而發展到工業上去，尤其使我們欣慰。不過，據同去的一區專員於樹巒氏談：章先生辦事業之初，遭到地方上人的反對，甚至糾集羣衆丢亂石到章先生的屋內，現在事業已辦出來，社會上已知道了好處，但還有很多人存着觀望與不甚樂意的念頭」。是的，我們知道辦一樁事業，一定有很多的阻力，全憑着毅力去克復，但我們更熱望章先生能以寬大的胸襟，來號召反對與漠不關心的人士參加榮建協會的組織，使他們明瞭這也是他們自己的事業，有發言與建議的機會，這樣或許會更能順利的開展。</p>

<h3>棉的世界　南通廿四日訊</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　叢永樞</p>
<p>囤購惡風</p>
<p>紗和南通人有特殊的關係，南通紗業公會的會員多到有九百多戶，可是實際經營紗業的僅有三分之二還不到。走在南通市上，可以看見磁器店，布店或者電料行的門旁也釘着「××紗號』的招牌，而店裏一包紗也看不見。最奇特的，南通幾乎每個人家都有紗，有錢的股富固然囤紗，一個公務員也會把辛苦一月得來的薪金去買紗，黄包車夫，理髪師也把平日積蓄的錢去買紗。一個人家先生沒有紗，太太也許有，太太沒有，老媽子也許有。這現象的產生，主要還是因爲過去物價波動太劇，大家都怕鈔票放在家裏貶値，不得不去購貿物資。買米糧，要蛆要霉，買其他的東西不是收藏不便，就是一時難以賣出。只有棉紗最方便，今天要錢用，今天就可以立卽賣掉。不但城裏人是這樣，附近鄕裏稍有餘錢的人家，也有不少藏着紗。幣制改革後，這現象也許好一些，有的人家爲了應付日用，已買出了一部分。但據估計南通城內外六鎭，至少有一萬二千戶，每戶就算儲有一包紗，總數就有一萬二千包，合三百件。</p>
<p>紗的供應</p>
<p>紗的供應情形怎麼樣呢？過去百分之七十仰給於南通的大生一廠副廠，百分之三十賴江南。現在江南已無紗北來，只有完全仰賴大生廠了。據司副廠長說：一副兩廠每天能出紗一百四十件，其中有四十件要留給自己織布，所餘一百件中，又要以五十件運上海，選政府的代紡紗，所以只能有五十件配到市上，在平日這個數目充以維持市上需要數個，可是到現在土布旺季，便供應不數了。最近一週來，紗號的貨樹上很少看到有一包紗放在那裏「待沽」，老　們開口很漂亮：「都賣光了，等配紗！」其實，除了一部份已賣給土布機戶外，其餘的都已「轉移陣地』了。最近舉辦物資登記，很多的紗號只報存有一二十小包紗，果真只有這麽一些兒麼?南門外復大紗號登記的只有五十小包鐵建隊接到密報在雙十節前夜去搜查，結果發現存紗超過登記數量，商人是巧妙的，他把棉紗堆成一張床，來作爲掩護。</p>
<p>市面上沒有紗，織土布的機戶買掉布又不願閒散一天，他們便到處找，市面上沒有，便到後街小巷不賣紗的商號，不開店的住戶去找，化高於限價的價錢，買回去好動工傳點蠅頭之利。當然，這其中也就不免有「黄牛」在鑽了。</p>
<p>冷門土布</p>
<p>土布是南通的大宗產品，中秋以後，算是吒季。最近更因閩·台·寗波各帮來通放價搶購（土布沒限價），加之土布不在禁運之列，滬上游資便有打這個冷門的，藉土布爲中間媒介，而逃向台灣或南洋；致使土布價格陡漲三四成到五成不等，造成出品數量的特殊繁榮。土布出數陡增，需紗數量也便隨之而陡增，造成了缺紗大恐慌。據說，道其中還夾雜着一個匪軍套購的工作。秋去冬來，匪軍需要大量布疋製冬服，於是數勵農民把不適合製冬服的尺幅的布疋售出，而套取棉紗，運回鄉區，織適於匪用的布疋。這也是運日布市擁擠的原因之一。</p>
<p>注意漏洞</p>
<p>花·紗·布·在南通配合得很緊密，要打破目前的畸形關係，須一方面取締囤積，一方面疏導原料來源，同時更須注意供應的合理，不使有漏洞，不使有從中套購的便宜。這就不僅是經濟管制問題，而需要政治，軍事，作更進一步的配合。</p>
<p>至於綢布·呢絨·百貨捲烟等，都是仰給於上海，雖現在鬧「缺貨」，但在上海整個的消費與供應管制有了具體措施以後，只要給與商人以合法的利潤，「缺貨」現象是不難解決的。商人的算盤在「利」字上打上打下，不法奸商更不惜把商品從市塲抽出，而轉入黑市牟利。偏好逢到紫重情感的主顧，贊得一點黑市用品感激之不暇，有誰還肯去檢舉曾經帮了忙的「朋友」，使他陷入囹圄呢？這便使黑市更爲猖概。經管當局對出賣黑市的商人固然應處罰，對於買黑市商品的顧主，似乎也該給予相當的處分。使人民知道反奸商，平物價，是人民自己的事，要人民自己一齊來動手。</p>

<h3>Government Decides to Continue Price Controls; Economic Control Commission Agrees on New Plan; Executive Yuan to Discuss and Pass Tomorrow Before Announcing; Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee Appoints Nine to Draft Proposal to Stabilize Currency Value</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] After two days of thorough discussion by the authorities, supplementary new measures for financial and economic reform were finalized on the 28th. A plan is to be formulated and is expected to be announced and implemented on October 31st or November 1st. The Economic Control Conference convened by Premier Weng was held all day on the 28th, from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, with a break for lunch, and resumed at 4:00 PM, ending at approximately 7:00 PM. The conference formulated a comprehensive and concrete strategy to improve the current economic situation and remedy the problems discovered in the implementation of economic controls after the currency reform. A draft of these new measures has been prepared during the conference. Premier Weng has scheduled a special Executive Yuan meeting on the 30th for discussion. Once formally approved by the Executive Yuan, it will be immediately promulgated. The draft is currently being compiled and transcribed. Before being submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting, it will first be submitted to the Central Political Committee for discussion. All parties are striving to maintain secrecy regarding this decision before its official announcement, refusing to reveal its contents. However, it can be reported that the government will not abandon price controls, but will flexibly apply price limits in implementation to resolve the issues of hoarding and lack of goods, and to stabilize the people's livelihood. At the same time, a decision has been made to improve the salaries of civil servants. The plan also includes provisions for controlling supplies, implementing rationing, increasing production, and setting prices for state-owned public utilities.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Executive Yuan Premier Weng Wenhao summoned Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan and some members of the banking community at 10:00 PM on the 28th for consultation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held its regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, chaired by Ma Chaojun. During the meeting, a wide-ranging discussion on current economic issues was held, with various committee members expressing their opinions. However, no conclusion was reached, and the matter will be discussed by the Central Political Committee after Premier Weng Wenhao and the Economic Control Commission formulate the supplementary measures for economic reform. During the meeting on the 28th, Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, reported in detail on the economic situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Finance and Economics Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a plenary committee meeting on the morning of the 28th. Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, and others were invited to attend and answer questions. The meeting discussed the proposal to convene a committee meeting to "address the drastic changes in the economic situation since the currency reform, which threaten the people's livelihood, and to conduct a detailed study of the current situation, appoint committee members to draft an improvement plan, stabilize the currency, and stabilize the people's livelihood." Committee members spoke enthusiastically on current financial and economic issues. Ultimately, Wang Menglin and eight others were appointed to be responsible for drafting a plan, to be reported to the committee for discussion within a short period.</p>
<h3>Correction Proposal on the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Properties in Shanghai Approved in Principle; Supervisory Yuan's Two Committees Appoint Three Committee Members to Draft the Text</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The correction proposal submitted by Supervisory Committee members Yu Peihou and Ni Bi of the Su-Zhe District Administrative Office regarding the sale of enemy and puppet properties in Shanghai was reviewed at a joint meeting of the Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Food Committee and the Internal Affairs and Land Administration Committee at 3:00 PM on the 28th. Chairman Liu Pingjiang presided over the meeting, which was attended by more than 30 Supervisory Committee members. In addition to the proposers explaining the reasons, many people spoke. It was decided that the correction proposal was approved in principle, and Liu Pingjiang, Leng Pudong, and Yu Peihou were appointed to draft the text. The principles are two: (1) The valuation was too low. (2) The method of sale was incorrect. Representatives of public opinion organs should participate in the valuation committee. The three committee members are scheduled to draft the text starting on the 29th and submit it to the Executive Yuan for processing. According to the original case, the reasons were: "The Executive Yuan's administrative meeting passed on October 13th of the 37th year of the Republic (1948), the methods to accelerate the sale of enemy and puppet real estate. Its measures actually maintain private interests and damage national rights. According to Article 97 of the Constitution and Article 23 of the Supervisory Law, a correction proposal is submitted." The facts stated therein are extremely detailed, listing the Executive Yuan's repeated changes to the deadline for the sale of enemy and puppet properties, the low price of the sales valuation, all of which disregarded the government's credibility and national interests, specializing in facilitating private individuals and harming the country, and that the so-called custodians (i.e., those occupying enemy and puppet houses) were a small number of officials, big and small, and relatives, friends, and old acquaintances of most of the receiving personnel. The method of sale did not adopt open bidding, but allowed custodians to have priority in purchasing. Shanghai's houses are worth an ounce of gold for every inch of land, and custodians have occupied garden houses in Shanghai for several years for nothing. The original case also contained the following warning: "Is the so-called priority purchase method not encouraging occupation and fostering corruption?" "The government disposes of stockpiled real estate, and is helpless against these custodians who improperly profit. How can it implement the equalization of land rights and implement the Principle of People's Livelihood?" It also stated: If the sale of enemy and puppet properties in Shanghai were handled through open bidding, the total value could reach approximately 1 billion gold yuan, but with the previous legal valuations, the government could not receive 200 million gold yuan. The entire case is thousands of words long, detailing the accumulated abuses. Yu said at the meeting that he believed this matter had not received the attention of the central government, and that if a correction could be submitted to the Executive Yuan before it was handled, the country's revenue would certainly be substantial.</p>
<h3>Deficits in Grain Rationing Figures</h3>
<p>Yao Jian Reports to Legislative Yuan's Grain Administration Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] According to the Grain News Agency: Yao Jian, Director of the Allocation Group of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee, attended the Legislative Yuan's Grain Administration Committee on the 28th and reported on the general operations of urban rationing and the actual situation of grain fund deficits. He classified and explained the actual funding needs for costs and distribution fees, stating that the cost of each long ton of rationed grain was 246.34 gold yuan, including transportation commissions of 8.26 gold yuan, bank handling fees of 10.65 gold yuan, transit losses of 6.47 gold yuan, sack depreciation of 5.50 gold yuan, and interest on overdraft funds of 8.51 gold yuan, totaling 285.73 gold yuan. The expenses required for distribution included warehouse rent, insurance, and delivery expenses totaling 6.616 gold yuan, grain area handling fees of 7.94 gold yuan, Civil Mediation Committee business management fees of 7.94 gold yuan, and receiving bank handling fees of 2.44 gold yuan, totaling 24.93 gold yuan. Adding the Emergency Procurement Committee business management fee of 1.43 gold yuan, the total cost was 312.09 gold yuan. However, the revenue from selling each long ton was only 145.22 gold yuan (the selling price was 10 gold yuan per shi, 50% lower than the market price), resulting in a deficit of 166.87 gold yuan, an average subsidy of 12 gold yuan per shi.</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Summons and Addresses Hebei-Peiping Party Affairs Workers, Encouraging Them to Thoroughly Implement Total War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 28th] Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek summoned Chu Xichun, chairman of the Hebei Province and Peiping Municipality Party Affairs workers, and over 30 provincial and municipal committee members at the provisional headquarters at 11:00 AM on the 28th.

<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Convenes Meeting with Women Leaders in Peiping</h3>
<p>Formation of New Life Movement Women's North China Branch</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 28th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting with Madame Fu Zuoyi, Madame Chen, and over 30 women leaders in Peiping at the Presidential Residence at 4:00 PM on the 28th to discuss the formation of the North China Branch of the New Life Movement Women's Association. During the meeting, Madame Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech, hoping that the women's movement in the north could be unified, closely linked with the Nanjing New Life Movement Women's General Association and branches in various places, and jointly promote the mission of rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees. Next, she introduced Madame Liu Yunsheng, wife of Generalissimo Fu Zuoyi, to the audience, and recommended Madame Liu as the chairwoman. She then expressed her hope to see complete success when she comes to Peiping next time. After the speech, the business committee members were elected. Madame Chiang also handed over a copy of the New Life Movement handbook and the New Life Movement Women's Committee regulations to Liu Yunsheng, the elected chairwoman of the North China Branch, asking her to quickly promote the work.</p>
<h3>Peking University Professors Resume Teaching</h3>
<p>Telegraph Ministry of Education to Adjust Salaries and Request Government to Abandon Price Limits</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 28th] The Peking University Professors' Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Hu Shi. At Hu Shi's earnest request, the professors resumed teaching on the 28th. Although the students are still on leave, they will still go to the classrooms when the time comes. The professors had much discussion on the economic reform policy, criticizing the government for insisting on price limits for the sake of saving face, which is tantamount to burying one's head in the sand. Hu Shi also believed that currency reform was only partially successful and asked everyone to express their opinions for government reference. As a result, three resolutions were unanimously passed and telegraphed to the Ministry of Education: (1) Adjust salaries promptly based on the purchasing power of August 19th. (2) In the future, adjust the standard monthly according to the index compiled by local academic institutions. (3) Please the government to acknowledge the facts and abandon price limits. Peking University's salaries for October and November have all been paid, and the December salary will continue to be issued on November 1st. The President attaches great importance to the leave situation of various schools. Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yancai telegraphed Yuan Dunli, president of the Normal University, yesterday, hoping to persuade the professors not to escalate the situation. Zheng repeatedly inquired about the results by telegraph three times during the meeting of the Peking University Professors' Association.</p>
<h3>North China War Enters Turning Point; National Army Advances Towards Southern Hebei; It is Said That Three Branches of Our Heroic Army Have Joined Forces in Wangdu</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 28th] The Northern war situation has entered a turning point. With the President stationed in Peiping, the military affairs of North China have been given comprehensive and concrete direction. At 7:00 AM on the 27th, the entire Peiping-Baoding line was reopened, and the joining of the North and South National Armies in Caohe has demonstrated the beginning of an important military strategy. On the 28th, the focus of the entire North China war shifted to the area south of Baoding. At this moment, the main force of the National Army is making every effort to open up another new battlefield and reverse the current situation in North China. People in North China are looking forward to a complete change in the overall situation. According to information: various infantry and cavalry legions marching south along the Peiping-Baoding line have begun to march at extremely fast speeds. It is said that the three routes of the National Army, the central route of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section, the eastern route of Central Hebei, and the western route of Western Hebei (Manwan mountainous area), have joined forces near Wangdu, and are jointly marching south, pressing towards Southern Hebei with the force of a thousand jun thunderbolts. The air force also dispatched planes today to fly over Baoding to the south for reconnaissance. It is also learned that there are currently no large main force of bandits along the Peiping-Shijiazhuang road.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 28th] According to information: Fierce fighting is taking place on both banks of the Tang River south of Baoding. Part of the 7th Column of bandits is surrounded and stubbornly resisting. The artillery battle is fierce. It is said that the National Army marching south passed through Baoding and entered Wangdu at noon on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 28th] After the Peiping-Baoding Road was reopened on the 27th, it will be difficult to restore highway transportation within one or two days due to the southward shift of the National Army's forces. Commodity prices in Baoding fell sharply on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 28th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: The National Army marching south along the Peiping-Baoding line cleared the scattered bandits south of Caohe on the 27th and arrived in Baoding by dusk.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 28th] Military news: On the morning of the 27th, the National Army team recovered Panggezhuang, Yu Fa, and Huang Fa south of Peiping. The bandits crossed the Yongding River and fled south, and the area north of the Yongding River was cleared again.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Returns to Peiping</h3>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 28th] Generalissimo Fu Zuoyi flew back to Peiping from Zhangjiakou on the morning of the 28th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 28th] Fu Zuoyi flew from Peiping to Zhangjiakou on the 26th and flew back to Peiping on the morning of the 28th. During his stay in Zhangjiakou, Fu gave instructions on the military affairs of the Chahar province. On the 27th, he went to the Fendou New Village to comfort the families of the officers and soldiers suppressing the bandits. At a banquet of the Chahar Training Corps in the evening, he delivered a speech, stating briefly: (1) The gains and losses of Changchun and Jinan do not affect the military suppression of bandits; (2) The Communist bandits' violence and terror have determined their fate of failure; (3) Only the Three Principles of the People can bring about political democracy and economic equality; (4) Eradicate corruption and promote the virtues of diligence and frugality; (5) Firmly believe in the conviction of victory and complete the arduous task of suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<h3>No Change in Sui-Bao War</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 28th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced the battle situation in Chahar and Suiyuan: (1) There is no change in the Sui-Bao war. Remnant bandits between Taigemu, Biqi, and Gaixian between Sui and Bao intermittently destroyed railways and had minor contact with the patrolling National Army.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Household Census</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Economic Supervision Office, in order to reissue national identity cards and ration purchase certificates to comprehensively implement rationing and purchase plans starting next month, have decided to conduct a citywide household census on the eighth of next month. They have also promulgated implementation guidelines, notifying citizens to pay attention to three items: (1) During the census, all members of the household must be gathered inside the house, maintaining a state of stillness, and the census taker will check each household and each person one by one, stamping the newly issued national identity card photos on the spot and issuing them by name. (2) Citizens who have not yet obtained an identity card must fill out an application for a national identity card in advance, attaching two photos. If they have not yet applied for household registration, they must first fill out an application for household registration. (3) The "Jia" is the basic unit of the household census, with two census takers assigned to each "Jia." A total of 56,000 people are needed for the entire city. The authorities will mobilize 70,000 government employees and students to assist in the process. This shows that the scale of the household census being conducted in Shanghai this time, and the extent of its mobilization, is an unprecedented event in our country's modern household administration.</p>
<p>The household census should be called a population census. Its significance lies in investigating the static population at a specific point in time. The resulting statistics should be called static population statistics. This is a measure used in practical politics that is employed by sociology and statistics, and is highly valued by general progressive countries and good citizens. However, a population census is slightly different from household registration administration. Household registration administration records population dynamics and should fall within the scope of household registration law. The purpose of the household census being conducted in Shanghai this time is to issue "national identity cards" based on static population statistics, calculating by household and by head, and the identity card is also to certify the people's domicile and identity, to prove personal rights and to determine obligations. The legal basis for the "National Identity Card" is the new Household Registration Law. Therefore, this time, Shanghai's population census, technically speaking, is a census of the static population within a specified time in the entire city, and then, based on static statistics, in accordance with the provisions of the Household Registration Law, issue new "national identity cards" by household and by head. The procedures are complicated and difficult, and it requires patient and meticulous work to avoid errors. In particular, when conducting the census, it is necessary to comply with the law and academic principles, paying attention solely to the population census itself, without involving anything else, in order to avoid harassment, to leave a better impression of the "new administration" on the people, and to ensure that it does not cause conflicts in its effectiveness. This is a very important matter.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance against Japan, Kunming conducted a non-standard household survey, and Chongqing also conducted a trial identity registration survey, issuing "Resident Identity Registration Certificates" to the city's population, which was the predecessor of the current National Identity Card. The experience of Kunming and Chongqing in those years can serve as a reference for this Shanghai household census. The Kunming household survey placed more emphasis on academic significance than on administrative significance. Before the survey, it mobilized elementary school teachers throughout the city to receive household survey training, and then used them as investigators to conduct the survey. There are three points worth noting in the Kunming survey: First, it divided the city into 150 survey districts and had inspectors to conduct random checks; second, it first surveyed ordinary households and then concentrated its efforts on surveying public households (such as schools, institutions, and the military); third, the publicity was good, and the citizens had few misunderstandings. The Chongqing identity registration, on the other hand, placed more emphasis on administrative significance than on academic significance. It established a special agency, mobilized a large number of military police, and based the survey on quite numerous survey forms, taking six months to complete. From a strict point of view, the Chongqing registration survey met the requirements of strict effectiveness; from an economic point of view, Chongqing was indeed wasteful. This time, Shanghai is holding a population census, with the active purpose of facilitating rationing and purchasing, and the need is pressing, and the preparations are rushed. We hope to achieve strictness on the principle of non-wastefulness and to achieve accuracy and universality in a quick time. And we hope that the good citizens of the entire city will enthusiastically support this matter, which is related to their own rights and obligations, and not misunderstand it, causing trouble. This is very important.</p>
<p>Shanghai's household census has been scheduled to take place from 9:00 PM on November 8th to 1:00 AM on November 9th. During this short preparation period, it is hoped that the relevant agencies' preparation work will be serious, meticulous, and thorough. In law and technology, the household census portion should be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the "Population Census Law," adapting to the time and place. The issuance of national identity cards should be in accordance with the provisions of the "Household Registration Law" regarding identity registration, paying special attention to personal origin, age, and occupation, so that the issuance of this identity card can have the effect of certifying personal identity, thereby protecting personal rights and determining personal obligations. Finally, it is hoped that the investigators will be particularly diligent and humble when conducting the survey and will not disturb the people, so that the citizens will have faith. As for the rumors of attaching a survey of "underground warehouses," this kind of mixed and chaotic approach is absolutely unacceptable. Because general progressive countries regard the population census as an educational topic, using it to train people to abide by the law, it is necessary to start with the investigators themselves strictly abiding by the law. In the past, when India held a population census, it fully achieved the goal of people's self-governance education. The five million citizens of Shanghai have a higher level of knowledge, and whether ordinary households or public households, they should enthusiastically support and assist the government in completing this great work with contemporary educational significance, as a demonstration for the national household registration. And the 70,000 people responsible for the survey, in particular, are responsible for the smooth and effective implementation of the new administration, and need to be particularly humble and diligent, to establish a new style of politics. This is our greatest hope for this Shanghai household census.</p>
<h3>Engineers Association Closed Today, Next Session Decided to Be Held in Guangzhou; Many Proposals Recommended to the Government Were Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 28th] The General Assembly of the Engineers Association elected five members of the next selection committee at around 6 PM. Mao Yisheng, Wu Yun-chu, Hu Shuhua, Yang Jiayu, and Hong Lingxun were elected, and it was also decided that the next annual meeting will be held in Guangzhou. The General Assembly is scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 29th, and some members will leave Taiwan on the "Zhongxing" ship on the morning of the 29th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 28th] The Engineers Association discussed proposals this afternoon, chaired by Ling Hongxun. A total of thirty-three proposals were received. The main points are as follows: (1) The current Engineer Law is not applicable to engineers. The draft Engineer Law proposed by the Wuhan branch was passed and submitted to the board of directors for revision, and then submitted to the government to remove the industrial and mining engineer section from the current Engineer Law and regroup it into the Engineer Law separately. (2) It is recommended that the government complete the Chongqing-Rongchang section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway ahead of schedule and quickly repair the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. The board of directors will first formulate a plan before submitting it. (3) A committee will be formed by the General Assembly and the Shanghai branch to study Japanese reparations and recommend that the government carry out planned construction. (4) It is recommended that the government use the Southwest region as a heavy industry center and develop it as soon as possible. (5) Please ask the Ministry of the Interior to cancel Article 7 of the Regulations on the Management of the Construction Industry. (6) Please strengthen the automatic machinery industry inspection agency, and the Automatic Machinery Society will draft a plan to recommend to the government. (7) Please ask the government to reward the automobile manufacturing industry. (8) The association will invite experts to discuss ways to improve highway engineering, and please ask the government to adopt them. (9) Unify the names of the metric units of measurement and ask the government to adopt them. (10) Please unify engineering terms. The General Assembly also had an important proposal, proposed by eleven branches including Shanghai, recommending that the government should have domestic engineers or engineering institutions preside over important projects and engineering designs. The General Assembly specially invited Engineer Hu Ruixiang, who had just returned from the United States, to explain this. He said: "Regarding the use of special funds for US aid construction, the government signed a contract with the United States, which must be supervised by them, and the aid recipients have all spontaneously invited consultants or engineering technicians from major US engineering companies. In fact, the government agreement does not have this stipulation, so if a bad precedent is set, the status of Chinese engineers will decline and become irreversible, which will also damage national interests," etc. After enthusiastic speeches from various members, it was decided to present a request to the Executive Yuan, ordering the US Aid Council and aid recipients to handle the matter in accordance with the original proposal. The General Assembly also passed a resolution to pay tribute to Taiwanese engineers.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] At this morning's General Assembly of the Engineers Association, chaired by Yun Zhen, a joint special topic discussion was held: (1) Yang Qing gave a lecture on "Taiwan's Construction and Coordination with the Mainland," and (2) Yan Yancun gave a lecture on the possibility of industrial development in Taiwan. Chairman Yun Zhen hoped that members would write their opinions in writing and hand them over to the speakers for compilation, in order to provide reference for the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 28th] More than ten representatives of the National Shipping Federation, including Wei Wenhan, Shi Fuchang, and Li Yunliang, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 28th.

<h3>Shantou Is Not an International Airport, We Did Not Allow Siamese Aircraft to Land</h3>

<h3>China and Britain Propose Joint Recommendation Urging Jewish Troops to Withdraw from Occupied Areas If They Refuse, Sanctions Will Be Considered</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 28th Broadcast: After the representatives of various countries in the Security Council spoke and debated the Sino-British proposal on the Arab-Israeli dispute, the Soviet representative, Malik, requested time to consider the proposal and suggested that the Security Council postpone the vote until the next meeting. The Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, proposed postponing the vote for two days. When Manuilsky's suggestion was put to a vote, the result was four votes in favor, four votes against, and three abstentions. Chairman Austin announced that there was no need to postpone the vote for two days. Finally, Malik proposed adjourning the meeting until the 29th, and with no objections, Austin announced that the meeting would be adjourned until the next day for voting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] The Chinese and British delegations submitted a proposal to the Security Council on the 28th, requesting that the Jewish side be ordered to withdraw from the newly occupied territories in the Negev area. If refused, possible economic and political penalties on both sides would be considered immediately. A spokesperson for the US delegation said that the United States would support this proposal. The proposal requires: (1) Israeli and Egyptian forces should withdraw simultaneously and restore the pre-war status of the Negev region; (2) The Security Council's subsidiary committee should consider possible economic and diplomatic penalties against any party that refuses to withdraw its troops. When British representative Jebb presented this proposal, he warned that the Security Council could not allow the Jewish side to maintain the territory it had captured in the Negev area. Jebb spoke after a report by UN Special Mediator for the Holy Land, Bunche. He said that the Security Council could not ignore the recent Negev war. He criticized Jewish military action in the Negev, saying that the Security Council could not allow it to maintain its newly occupied territories, and the Security Council could not appear weak and incompetent, as this might lead to the recurrence of a full-scale conflict. In his report, Bunche also warned the Security Council that the situation in the Negev had jeopardized the Holy Land truce. He urged the Jewish side to withdraw from its new occupied territories in the Negev and urged the Security Council to take action to ease the situation. Bunche and Jebb engaged in a heated debate with Israeli representative Eban, but Eban did not indicate that the Israeli army was prepared to withdraw from the Negev. He said, "Restoring Egypt's position would be the greatest chaos in the world. Every Egyptian soldier in Palestine is a symbol of violation of the UN Charter." The joint Sino-British proposal would be the first step in possible forceful measures.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 28th] According to the official announcement on the 28th, Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok invited Egypt to peace talks to resolve all differences. This invitation was sent to Israeli representative Eban in Paris, who then passed it on to the Egyptian representatives attending the UN General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang to Return Home by Plane Tonight After Visiting British Authorities Bevin and Others Invited to Banquet at Our Embassy Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Discusses Sino-British Relations Deeply Believes that the Suppression of the Rebellion Will Not Divide China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] On the eve of our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's arrival here, The Times published a half-page report by its correspondent at the United Nations, interviewing Wang. The report stated that Wang has been extremely concerned about the construction problems in the United Kingdom since he led a Chinese delegation to visit the United Kingdom during the war, and now expects that there will be a great future for Sino-British trade. Wang said: The economic recovery of the United Kingdom and the political attitude shown by the British government towards the people of Asia have left an excellent impression in China. British people currently staying in China are more likely to be well-liked than British people staying in China at any time in the history of Sino-British relations. In terms of economy, the prices of high-quality British goods sold in China are lower than those from other places. In terms of politics, the various actions of the British government in the past three or four years have left a deep impression not only on Chinese intellectuals and businessmen, but also on the majority of the Chinese people. Wang then discussed the problems in China and asked Westerners to correct their mistaken notion that China would be divided into two countries in the current anti-communist struggle. Wang said that he personally firmly believed that China would not be divided. Wang said: After thirteen years of conflict with Japan over the Northeast issue, the national consciousness of the Chinese people has become extremely strong. He did not believe that communism could suppress this kind of consciousness, and said that the personality and tradition of the Chinese people made it extremely difficult for communism to take root in the hearts of the Chinese people. On the contrary, the treatment suffered by the Chinese people in the communist-controlled areas has made them automatically oppose communism. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese people who have been forced to flee from the communist areas are beginning to organize themselves spontaneously, hoping to fight back to their homeland. This movement is rapidly expanding. Wang believed that Chinese communist theory is no different from Western European communist theory, and believed that not only are the revolts of Eastern communists related to each other, but these revolts are also closely related to Western strikes. All communist actions are not accidental, but will contribute to a major offensive. This situation must be prevented. The stable and rapid recovery of Western Europe will have a significant impact on China's suppression of the rebellion, which is undoubtedly the case.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The United States recently conducted the largest "Army, Navy, and Air Force" joint exercise since the war at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, with 9,000 people and 500 aircraft participating.

If another World War breaks out, the greatest threat facing the United States will be from submarines.

Assistant Secretary of the Navy Barb, in Memphis, said: If another war breaks out, the United States will "eventually" be able to clear the submarines from the sea. Undersecretary of the Navy Edes, in New Orleans, said: The US fleet in the Mediterranean is ready to act at any time and can react faster than any aggression that occurs in the region.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference this morning, "The US government has not yet discussed the issue of the North Atlantic security system, but the semi-official planning for this issue has concrete results. This result may enable the US government to make a quick decision on the North Atlantic security issue. After the signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty submit concrete proposals to the US government, the US government can propose a final answer regarding US aid, but this will still take considerable time, because all departments of the US government must have deliberate discussions.</p>

<h3>The Authorities Today Allocated a Large Amount of Yarn and Cloth in Exchange for 500,000 Shi of Rice and Wheat Each Expected to be Completed within 20 Days for the Next Month's Rationing</h3>
<p>In order to smooth the source of grain and strengthen the supply, the authorities decided to allocate 6,000 pieces of yarn and 60,000 bolts of cloth to the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee to exchange for grain. The batch of materials can be received by the Grain Purchase Committee today, and will be transported to the production areas by the Agricultural Bank of China, the Jiangsu Agricultural Bank, and the Cooperative Treasury. The exchange ratio is 40% in kind and 60% in cash. It is estimated that 500,000 shi of rice and wheat can be exchanged for the next month's rationing in this city. The exchange work is expected to be completed within 20 days.</p>
<p>Regarding the October rationing in this city, in addition to the 290,000 shi that have already been distributed, the remaining 260,000 shi are scheduled to be sold on the 10th of next month and have been arriving in batches up to date. The Grain Storage Committee's allocation plan has been largely completed. However, the biggest difficulty at present is that although the source of grain has been arranged, it is difficult to transport it to Shanghai as planned due to the obstruction of the local authorities. In recent days, the Grain Storage Committee has received dozens of telegrams from various production areas, all stating that even with the release certificates from the competent authorities, they are still unable to transport the grain. This is the main reason why the rice supply for households in this city is not continuous. In order to ensure that the people's food supply is worry-free in the future, the unreasonable phenomenon of local authorities acting independently must be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Rushing to Transport 140,000 Tons of Coal Supplying Coal for Rationing in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>

In terms of existing coal, Huainan has more than 120,000 tons and East China also has about 50,000 tons.</p>

<h3>Economic Police Brigade Cracks Two Major Gold and Foreign Currency Cases Involving International Backgrounds; Three Foreign and Chinese Suspects Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade cracked two major black market gold and foreign currency cases yesterday, one of which involved an international background. The total amount of U.S. dollars seized in both cases was approximately over 10,000. Out of caution, the brigade has refrained from releasing any information until the investigation of both cases is concluded. However, according to reliable sources, prior to the crackdowns, Chinese and foreign personnel were mobilized to investigate, but were initially unable to proceed due to the involvement of certain parties. Finally, after seeking instructions from superiors and conducting a detailed review, the operation was carried out.

It is also learned that this case is a major factor contributing to the current black market for gold and foreign currency in the city, so the future developments are of considerable interest.</p>
<h3>Cleveland Receives Reporters and Reviews ECA's Aid to China, Aiding the Chinese People to Improve Living Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Cleveland, the Director of the China Program of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), has been in China for four weeks to inspect the work of the ECA's China Mission. Yesterday morning, Mr. Cleveland held his first press conference at the Cathay Hotel in this city. Mr. Stulman, the Director of the ECA's Industrial Construction and Accessories Survey Group, and Mr. Griffin, the Acting Director of the ECA's China Mission, were also present. After delivering his written statement, Mr. Cleveland answered reporters' questions, saying, "The ECA's current aid programs to China will not be delayed or changed due to the current changes in the domestic situation in China. The American aid work should still be promoted as much as possible in the areas under the current jurisdiction of the Chinese government."</p>
<p>Mr. Cleveland also stated, "So far, the ECA has not engaged in any direct negotiations with local governments or authorities in China. Everything is still concentrated on contacting the central government of China."</p>
<p>Mr. Stulman, in answering reporters' questions, stated: (1) The funds for the restoration of the Panyang Power Plant have not yet been allocated, and the plant has not yet hired engineers. However, the plant's restoration plan will proceed according to the planned steps. (2) The ECA is currently investigating the possible supply and prices of antimony, tungsten, and tin, etc., to be purchased in China.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of Mr. Cleveland's remarks:</p>
<p>Striving to Promote Work Goals</p>
<p>Mr. Cleveland pointed out at the meeting that half of the $204,000,000 allocated for the purchase of goods has been handled, and approximately $100,000,000 worth of goods have already arrived in China. He said that in the industrial sector, $70,000,000 has been allocated for accessories and construction plans, of which $60,000,000 has been handled. In addition, $275,000,000 has been allocated for rural construction. The U.S. Congress has allocated a total of $275,000,000 for the ECA to carry out aid to China within a year.</p>
<p>Mr. Cleveland, after inspecting the various activities of the ECA in China for the past four weeks, emphasized that the ECA is currently making every effort to promote its work goals in China, which is "to help the Chinese people, through the Chinese government, improve their lives as much as possible, and to enable the Chinese people to form an environment in which they can live and work."</p>
<p>We firmly believe that all plans and controls established in the implementation are to enable the ECA's funds to obtain the highest value in the following uses: to assist the Chinese people and various institutions, and to support the Chinese government in increasing production and stabilizing the economic situation. However, the current situation in China makes it impossible for us to measure the progress of the ECA's plan solely by the narrow effects obtained by direct beneficiaries. Moreover, the effects it brings—that is, the entire contribution of the ECA and other factors that promote the overall situation—are even more encouraging.</p>
<p>Two Principles of Aid Programs</p>
<p>Ultimately, an aid program can only produce a small effect in the country it is mandated to assist. Therefore, when implementing the aid to China program, we particularly adhere to the following two principles:</p>
<p>(1) The prices and exchange rates related to the aid program must be realistic. The allocated goods must be sold at prices stipulated by market conditions. The same applies to cotton textiles and petroleum products. This principle also applies to coal, electricity, or any other enterprise that directly or indirectly receives ECA aid. It should be known that aid programs are inherently different from subsidy programs.</p>
<p>(2) In order for the Chinese people to generally benefit from the aid program, the ECA must ensure that its aid serves as a supplement to the Chinese government's production and supply of materials, rather than a substitute. This is the "self-help principle" repeatedly emphasized by Mr. Lapham.</p>
<p>The fate of the ECA's aid to China program will naturally depend on the development of the current situation in China. Our purpose of aiding China is still to assist the Chinese people through the Chinese government, to improve their living conditions in any possible way, and to help them create an environment for survival and work.</p>

<h3>Fire in Open Space in Xie Xu Road Destroys Multiple Factories and Warehouses</h3>

<h3>Zhan Peilin and Zhan Yutian, Suspected of Hoarding Paper, Indicted by Special Criminal Court</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhan Peilin, the chairman of the Paper Industry Association, and his brother Zhan Yutian were arrested by the Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau and transferred to the Special Criminal Court for hoarding and profiteering. The case has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Zhu Cheng and was prosecuted yesterday. The following is an excerpt from the original indictment: "The defendant Zhan Peilin opened the Yiji Xinghao Paper Store and is also the chairman of the Shanghai Paper Industry Association. He hoarded a large amount of paper and stored it in his own warehouse. (1) 2,532 pieces of various sizes of paper were stored on the third floor of 21, Lane 131, Guangdong Road. (2) Approximately 1,130 pieces of various sizes of paper were stored at 5, Lane 135, Jiangxi Road. (3) Approximately 1,000 reams of various sizes of paper were stored at the sales department at 127 Shandong Road. (4) 504 reams of white paper were stored in the Fuxing Bank at 137 Guangdong Road, totaling 3,662 pieces and another 1,504 reams. In addition, 725 pieces of paper were stored on behalf of the Maotai Enterprise Company of Hankou Road. The defendant Zhan Yutian opened the Yizhong Paper Mill and hoarded 870 rolls of various paper blanks, with another 200 rolls stored in the transportation warehouse. The Shanghai Police Bureau's Economic Brigade has confirmed the facts. In addition to ordering the above-mentioned paper to be kept in custody, the defendants were arrested and transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Applicable Legal Articles</h3>
<p>Evidence and applicable legal articles: The defendant Zhan Peilin admitted to storing the above-mentioned paper, but insisted that he had no hoarding or profiteering behavior. However, according to the defendant's confession during the interrogation, the paper was purchased after the victory, one or two years ago. Since the victory, due to speculation and profiteering by illegal merchants, prices have fluctuated rapidly. The defendant stored a large amount of paper, failing to supply the needs, which undoubtedly violated the government's control of daily necessities. Although the defendant Zhan Yutian claimed that the raw materials could only supply three months and that there was no hoarding behavior, the Economic Police Brigade reported that the factory could only produce more than ten reams of paper per day due to equipment and electricity limitations. Therefore, the quantity of stored raw materials far exceeded the amount needed for three months. Therefore, it can be determined. His behavior, in accordance with Article 6 and Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Outline for the Implementation of the Constitution for Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion, Article 2, Clause D of the Measures for Combating Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Emergency Periods, and Article 7 of the National General Mobilization Law, should be punished in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing National General Mobilization."</p>

In the future, if each native bank has a legitimate purpose and requests not to use it, it will be handled in accordance with the regulations on the use of funds. If the cash increase portion exceeds 50%, the use of the exceeding portion will be approved by the Ministry on a more lenient basis. The funds stored in the Central Bank will also be allowed to pay interest in accordance with the deposit reserve requirements. In areas where there is no Central Bank branch, the local branch will negotiate with the Central Bank to handle it.</p>
<p>(4) (1) For the asset appreciation portion purchased after 1938, the national wholesale price index for June 1948 in the original calculation formula should be recalculated to the first half of August 1948, referring to Clause C of Item 4 of the Supplementary Measures for Fiscal Reorganization. (2) The original request to allow shareholders to use assets other than cash to offset the payment of shares cannot be approved. (3) When the remaining assets still have estimable value, they will be handled in accordance with the "Interpretation of Measures for Adjusting Capital of Commercial Banks."</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the issue of exchange guarantee deposits, the exchange guarantee deposits will still be paid in accordance with the regulations of the Central Bank, but during the capital adjustment period, they may be deducted from the amount of cash increase deposited in the Central Bank. The exchange guarantee deposit portion will not be returned after the three-month period.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the issue of interest rates, a separate order will be issued. After the Central Bank receives the telegram, it has telegraphed its regional branches and offices to check accordingly.</p>
<h3>Frozen Egg Export Business Completely Stalled</h3>
<p>According to news from frozen egg manufacturers yesterday, due to the August 19th price controls, various materials are flowing into the black market, and even at high prices, they cannot be purchased. The price of eggs has now risen to 2 jiao per egg, increasing costs and making it impossible to export. The UK has repeatedly ordered frozen eggs from our country and hopes to increase supply. However, the UK only offers a price of £210 per ton of frozen eggs, which translates to over 2,500 Gold Yuan. However, the total cost of producing one ton of frozen eggs is currently around 5,000 yuan. If frozen eggs are sold to the UK, each ton will result in a loss of 2,500 yuan, and the government cannot subsidize it. Therefore, our country's frozen egg industry is currently in a state of complete standstill.</p>
<h3>Funds Flowing South in Large Quantities - Total Reaching Five Million Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>After the announcement of the measures for clearing imports of goods ordered abroad with payments already made, merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach due to domestic price controls and are not importing. However, recently there has been much talk of negotiated prices, and merchants in general are excited again. According to insiders, major merchants have been selling goods and accumulating Gold Yuan, but they cannot restock. However, rumors of changing to negotiated prices are rampant, and large amounts of real gold are flowing south. In the past few days, the outflow of funds to the south has suddenly increased, estimated to be around five million Gold Yuan. It is generally speculated that there are two destinations: one is to exchange the funds for foreign currency after going south to maintain the value of the currency, and the other is to order large quantities of goods in Hong Kong and Macau and then import them. Although the current measures for clearing imports of goods ordered abroad with payments already made are limited to orders placed before August 19th, merchants can still find ways to obtain invoices before August 19th after purchasing goods in Hong Kong and other places and can apply for import. This not only maintains the value of the currency but also allows for profit.</p>
<h3>Construction and Building Textile Company Starts Selling Cotton Cloth - Applications Still Very Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Construction and Building Textile Company opened the distribution of cotton cloth as usual, including 12-pound Longtou B-grade fine cloth, priced at 25.9 yuan per bolt, and Jinlian Miaowu Yuan wool crepe, priced at 27.6 yuan per bolt. Second-grade printed colored tops were priced at 18.8 yuan per bolt, all limited to purchase at retail stores. Second-grade 30-yard wool crepe greige was priced at 23.8 yuan per bolt, limited to application by dye factories. There was also American cloth 013 printed cloth, priced at 1.1 yuan per meter, and 012 printed pongee, priced at 1.4 yuan per meter, and 014-11 printed twill, priced at 1.5 yuan per meter, all limited to application by retail stores. There were also cotton wool shirts and pants, Jianguo hemp yarn, etc., and many people applied to purchase them.</p>
<p>Also, the Cotton Cloth Association, acting as the agent for the dyeing industry's fourth phase, second batch of cloth distribution, had a total of only 9,860 bolts. There were 1,343 applicants, and each household was allocated 10 bolts. The remaining number of households was eliminated by lottery. Therefore, 986 households obtained cloth distribution in this phase, including 10 households whose applications were rejected due to non-compliance with purchase regulations, and another 347 households were eliminated by lottery. They will have priority in the next phase of distribution.</p>
<h3>Silk Farmers Use Autumn Cocoons to Reel Earthen Silk - Purchase Work Difficult to Start</h3>
<p>This year's autumn cocoon purchase in Liangzhe (Zhejiang) is difficult to start because the authorities set the price too low. Generally, silk farmers believe that the price is insufficient to cover costs, and they mostly reel earthen silk. After selling the finished product using the old method, they can still obtain ideal profits compared to selling to the government. Therefore, this year's autumn cocoon purchase work is not as satisfactory as expected.</p>
<p>According to information from the silk industry, the global supply of raw silk is now turning scarce. Although countries such as the UK, the US, and France all hope that our country will increase exports, the prices offered are too low, and domestic prices are rising everywhere. The raw materials allocated to each factory are very few. Currently, it is already difficult to purchase firewood, rice, oil, and salt to raise labor and food, and it is impossible to expand exports. Therefore, the export prospects for silk fabrics are not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Rice Arrivals Slightly Increased - Retail Sales Overcrowded</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals have slightly increased. The North and South city markets have a total of 2,209 dan (石) of rice, with 1,276 dan arriving at the South city market and 933 dan arriving at the North city market. Most of the arrivals are indica rice. Although there are no transactions in the market, market quotations have not changed. Rice store retail sales are extremely crowded, so even though there is a slight supply to the market, it is quickly bought empty.</p>
<p>Grain transactions are completely stalled. Gold is still not being distributed. Inventory owners hope to exchange for industrial products first and then exchange for soybeans in the production areas to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Quiet but Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for black and green tea, which has been traded for a long time, still did not see a recovery. The reason is that dealers are aware that goods in the production areas are scarce and prices are high, and it is increasingly difficult to purchase all the subsidiary raw materials for reproducing boxed tea. Therefore, their attitude is even more reluctant to part with them, and the supply is becoming more and more elusive. Although traders still come to think and want to make a profit, they ultimately find it difficult to find a single leaf, and the process is difficult to clarify. The market atmosphere is quiet but firm. According to news from local shops, since the panic buying trend occurred in Taishi (太市), all industries have felt a shortage of demand, and tea is no exception. Therefore, all shops are currently planning to increase stocks to meet retail sales.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit - High Black Market Interest Rates Unprecedented</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the credit market in the city remained tight. As the end of the month approaches, the market demand is eager. The market interest rate rose to 2 jiao 7 fen, with the highest reaching beyond 3 jiao, which is unprecedented since the currency system reform. Many industry banks and shops are short of funds, and turnover is very difficult.</p>
<h3>Subsidizing Farmers' Losses by Purchasing Cotton and Distributing Gauze</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of cotton farmers in the production areas being unwilling to sell raw cotton at controlled prices and spinning earthen yarn themselves, the cotton spinning industry in this city is paying close attention to this. It has recently been learned from the Joint Cotton Purchase Office that they have already taken effective countermeasures to avoid affecting the purchase of raw cotton. In addition to distributing gauze in the purchase price category to increase cotton farmers' profits, they will also telegraph local governments to assist in persuasion. According to the people at the Cotton Purchase Office, the reason why cotton farmers are unwilling to sell raw cotton at the prescribed price is that the gap between the purchase price and the price of daily necessities is too large. Therefore, the situation can be improved after adopting a partial barter system in the future.</p>
<h3>This Week's Rayon Distribution Temporarily Suspended - China Trust Bureau Maintains Controlled Price</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's Italian barter rayon has been shipped in succession to 4,400 boxes. Some customs clearance procedures have not yet been completed, and this week's distribution is temporarily suspended. The 240 boxes scheduled to be distributed on the 27th will also be distributed next time. As for the distribution price, according to the person in charge of the bureau, the distribution price will definitely maintain the August 19th controlled price, and the finished products manufactured by the manufacturers should also be sold at the controlled price. There is no reason for the reseller stores to increase prices. As for the black market that has occurred in the market, it is beyond the bureau's power. It is hoped that the competent authorities will crack down on it. Also, 2,200 boxes of Italian rayon will arrive at the port on the 29th.</p>
<p>Also, the raw silk market is sluggish abroad, hovering around US$3 per pound. Domestic black market price is surging, converting to 1,530 Gold Yuan per dan, while the actual cost is over 2,000. The black market exceeds the actual cost by a factor of one. Therefore, raw silk exports are extremely difficult, and export business has been suspended. According to industry authorities, the foreign demand for our raw silk is more urgent in the winter, and it will definitely turn firm and strong at that time, so the future is still optimistic.</p>

<h3>Linghu Construction</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 26th] Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Chen Gongxia said to the people of Linghu: "The direction of Linghu's current construction is correct. I hope you continue to do well and become a model for Zhejiang Province."</p>
<p>Linghu is a town under the jurisdiction of Wuxing County. In the old administrative system, it governed fourteen surrounding townships, called the Linghu District. The entire district covers an area of approximately 225 square kilometers, with a population of over 120,000. Waterways crisscross the area, and the people are mostly engaged in agriculture, with silk being the most important product. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the total area of mulberry fields in the district reached over 50,000 mu, with a total of over 15 million mulberry trees. Before 1926, the total amount of raw silk could reach about 8,000 loads. Other major products included fish, water chestnuts, and wool. During the Anti-Japanese War, Linghu became the site of the most intense guerrilla warfare due to the favorable waterway terrain. Agricultural production declined, and the town's commerce plummeted. Half of the town's houses were destroyed by artillery fire. The population sharply decreased, with only over 8,000 people remaining in Linghu town.</p>
<p>A New Beginning</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Pan Gongzhan, a native of Linghu in Shanghai, aspired to revive his hometown. With the efforts of Zhang Rongchu, a businessman in Shanghai, the small town of Linghu was revitalized.</p>
<p>Linghu began its new construction in October 1946. They first established a Linghu Construction Association in Shanghai. Then, Zhang Rongchu funded the construction of factories, schools, and other large-scale new buildings, and began to operate various businesses.</p>
<p>Regarding the agricultural sector, in 1946, the association purchased 700,000 mulberry seedlings and gave them to farmers unconditionally, and also provided improved silkworm eggs. In 1946, 14,000 sheets were given away completely, and 6,000 sheets in the autumn were also given away completely. In the spring of 1947, 25,000 sheets were provided, charging a nominal cost. In the autumn, 5,000 sheets were given away completely. In the spring of 1948, 60,000 sheets were provided, charging a nominal cost, and in the autumn, 13,000 sheets were offered at a 30% discount based on cost. To help poor farmers, they also provided silkworm egg loans, cash loans, and rice loans, and also sent people to provide free guidance on joint rearing of silkworms, and shared nurturing of young silkworms.</p>
<p>Fisheries Sector</p>
<p>Regarding the fisheries sector, the Linghu District Fish Farming Production Improvement Association was established, with thirteen sub-associations. The number of members has increased from 500 to over 1,300. They also negotiated low-interest loans with the Farmers Bank of China, totaling 130 million yuan in legal tender, and negotiated interest-free loans with the Central Fisheries Laboratory, totaling 180 million yuan in legal tender. They also collectively purchased a large number of fish fry. For fish farming techniques, the Central Fisheries Laboratory sent personnel to strengthen guidance on improvement in conjunction with the association. Due to low-interest loans and research guidance, production has increased dramatically. In 1945, 50,000 mature fish were transported and sold to other places, while in 1947, this number reached 137,498. Recently, 70 million fish fry were also transported. Regarding farmland water conservancy, 28 sections of embankments have been repaired, a rice cultivation experimental farm has been established, and 20 small water pumps have been purchased. Regarding the industrial sector, the Linghu Silk Reeling Factory has 250 kilowatts of electricity. In addition to supplying the silk reeling factory, it also supplies electricity to the entire town. There is also a chemical acid manufacturing plant that produces calcium carbonate using anthracite coal and tender stones from Dongting Mountain. The product is Hongji brand precipitated calcium carbonate, used as raw materials for manufacturing cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other products. Another product is Lanji brand, used as raw materials for manufacturing rubber, paper, paint, ink, and other products. The monthly output is 5,000 bags, which are transported and sold to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, and other places. The factory employs 175 workers.</p>
<p>Silk Reeling Factory Situation</p>
<p>The silk reeling factory began operations in June of this year. The current equipment includes three boilers, one multi-layer drying machine, and 408 vertical silk reeling machines. The source of fresh cocoons is the silkworm eggs supplied by the association. In the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, the factory purchases them with its own funds. Starting in the autumn of 1948, the factory implemented a system of encouraging farmers to exchange fresh cocoons for factory silk, in order to eliminate the reeling of local silk. The current daily output is about 8 loads. However, many Linghu farmers are still accustomed to old habits and still make their own local silk, unwilling to exchange cocoons for factory silk. Therefore, the factory may not be able to operate year-round. If it were to operate year-round, for eleven months, it would need over 26,000 piculs of fresh cocoons. The factory also has a plan to convert local silk to factory silk, and is currently experimenting with implementation. The factory employs 1,009 workers.</p>
<p>Farms, Etc.</p>
<p>There is also a stone powder factory, which is smaller in scale, that grinds white stone into white powder for rice milling and cosmetics manufacturing. It currently produces over 20 tons per day. Regarding the education sector, there is the Qing Shu Middle School, with over 50 faculty and staff members, 122 middle school students, and 1,084 elementary school students. All students are exempt from tuition fees. The school's funds come from 600 mu of Ikeda land and funds deposited at the Wuxing County Bank, as well as monthly donations from Yi Rongchu. Other facilities, such as farms and hospitals, have also been established. The farm has a total area of over 740 mu and employs 42 workers. It raised over 300 pigs, but unfortunately, they died due to swine fever and improper care. Other businesses are in the trial stage. The hospital is temporary, and a permanent Qing Shu Hospital is under construction. According to Zhang Rongchu, he also wants to improve the town's streets. He originally wanted to build some houses first, move the old street shops there, and then demolish the streets to widen them and build new roads with new-style houses before moving them back. However, some people in the local area do not agree with this, so it is still under consideration. There is also the Linghu Lingshan Park, designed by Ms. Tang Guanwang, which is currently under construction.</p>
<p>Overcoming Obstacles</p>
<p>During our half-day visit to Linghu, we saw the tall, spacious, new-style factory and school buildings, which made us admire the spirit of the hard-working builders. The builders first started by improving rural life and rural economic conditions, and then developed industry, which was especially gratifying to us. However, according to Yu Shuluan, the district commissioner who went with us, "Mr. Zhang encountered opposition from local people when he first started his business. Some even gathered crowds to throw rocks into Mr. Zhang's house. Now that the business has been established and society has recognized the benefits, there are still many people who are taking a wait-and-see attitude or are not very happy." Yes, we know that there are many obstacles to starting a business, and it takes perseverance to overcome them. However, we are even more eager for Mr. Zhang to use his generosity to call on those who oppose and are indifferent to join the Rongjian Association organization, so that they understand that this is also their own business and have the opportunity to speak and make suggestions. This may lead to smoother development.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Jinhua City Defense Command has decided to establish itself on November 1st. It is rumored that the commander will be concurrently held by Zhou Zhenqiang, commander of the Western Zhejiang Garrison District.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The county's conscription and grain borrowing have not been completed as scheduled. Conscription is difficult because the settlement fee exceeds the prescribed amount, so it is difficult to raise funds. Therefore, statistics show that the county is short of 2/10 of the quota. Pre-borrowed military grain is also short because there is no rice available for purchase locally. According to the price limit, each city stone of brown rice is 16.3 yuan. Purchasing from other places is impossible due to the large price difference. Therefore, the shortage is still far from the allotted 15,000 stones. Currently, efforts are being made to supervise the situation separately.</p>
<p>Yixing</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recently, the government has purchased a large amount of firewood and grass, causing much public concern. County Magistrate Li solemnly stated that the county is organizing the collection of firewood and grass under the command of Wuxi. Eleven counties are doing this at the same time. Some unscrupulous people are intentionally spreading rumors to disturb the people. Investigators have been dispatched to investigate and severely punish them in accordance with military law.</p>
<h3>The World of Cotton - Nantong, 24th</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Cong Yongshu</p>
<p>The Evil Wind of Hoarding</p>
<p>Yarn and Nantong people have a special relationship. The Nantong Yarn Industry Association has over 900 members, but only two-thirds are actually engaged in the yarn business. Walking on the streets of Nantong, you can see that porcelain shops, cloth shops, or electrical supply stores also have signs that say "×× Yarn Shop," but you can't see a single bag of yarn in the store. Most strangely, almost every family in Nantong has yarn. Wealthy shareholders hoard yarn, and even a civil servant will use their hard-earned monthly salary to buy yarn. Rickshaw pullers and barbers also use their savings to buy yarn. If the head of the household doesn't have yarn, the wife might have it. If the wife doesn't have it, the maid might have it. The main reason for this phenomenon is that prices have fluctuated too drastically in the past. Everyone is afraid that the money will depreciate if kept at home, so they have to buy materials. Buying rice and grain can lead to worms and mold, and buying other things is inconvenient to store or difficult to sell immediately. Only cotton yarn is the most convenient. If you need money today, you can sell it immediately. Not only are city people like this, but many families in nearby rural areas with a little extra money also hoard yarn. After the currency reform, this phenomenon may improve somewhat. Some families have already sold some to meet their daily needs. However, it is estimated that there are at least 12,000 households inside and outside the six towns of Nantong. Even if each household stores one bag of yarn, the total is 12,000 bags, or 300 bales.</p>
<p>Supply of Yarn</p>
<p>What is the supply situation of yarn? In the past, 70% was supplied by the Dasheng No. 1 Factory and the remaining 30% by Jiangnan. Now, no yarn comes north from Jiangnan, so it is completely dependent on the Dasheng Factory. According to Deputy Factory Director Si, the two factories can produce 140 bales of yarn per day, of which 40 bales must be reserved for their own weaving. Of the remaining 100 bales, 50 bales must be shipped to Shanghai for the government's commissioned spinning. Therefore, only 50 bales can be allocated to the market. On weekdays, this number is sufficient to maintain the market's needs, but now, during the peak season for local cloth, the supply is insufficient. In the past week, it has been rare to see a bag of yarn placed on the shelves of yarn shops "for sale." The shopkeepers say beautifully: "Sold out, waiting for allocation!" In fact, in addition to a portion that has been sold to local cloth weaving households, the rest has been "transferred." Recently, during the material registration, many yarn shops only reported storing ten or twenty small bags of yarn. Is this really all they have? The Fuda Yarn Shop outside the South Gate only registered 50 small bags. The Iron Construction Team received a tip and searched the shop on the eve of Double Ten Day, and found that the yarn stored exceeded the registered amount. Merchants are clever, they pile up cotton yarn to make a bed to cover it.</p>
<p>Since there is no yarn on the market, the weaving households buy the cloth and are unwilling to be idle for a day. They go everywhere to find yarn. If it is not available on the market, they go to the merchants in the back streets and alleys who do not sell yarn, or to the residents who do not open stores. They buy it back at a price higher than the limit price in order to earn a small profit. Of course, there are inevitably "scalpers" taking advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Unpopular Local Cloth</p>
<p>Local cloth is a major product of Nantong. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is considered the peak season. Recently, because Fujian, Taiwan, and Ningbo merchants have come to Nantong to lower prices and buy in bulk (there is no price limit on local cloth), and because local cloth is not on the list of prohibited goods, speculators in Shanghai have been taking advantage of this unpopular item, using local cloth as an intermediary to escape to Taiwan or Southeast Asia. This has caused the price of local cloth to rise sharply by 30% to 50%, creating a special boom in the quantity of products. The sharp increase in the number of local cloth products has led to a sharp increase in the demand for yarn, causing a major yarn shortage panic. It is said that this also involves a work of procurement by the bandit army. From autumn to winter, the bandit army needs a large number of fabrics to make winter clothes, so they encourage farmers to sell cloths with inappropriate widths for making winter clothes and extract cotton yarn, which is transported back to the rural areas to weave fabrics suitable for use by the bandits. This is also one of the reasons for the crowding in the cloth market.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Loopholes</p>
<p>Yarn is closely linked to the cloth in Nantong. To break the current deformed relationship, we must crack down on hoarding on the one hand, and dredge the source of raw materials on the other hand. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the rationality of supply, so that there are no loopholes, and that there is no opportunity to profit from procurement. This is not only a matter of economic control, but also requires political and military cooperation for further progress.</p>
<p>As for silk cloth, wool, department stores, cigarettes, etc., they are all dependent on Shanghai. Although there is currently a "shortage," as long as concrete measures are taken for Shanghai's overall consumption and supply control, and merchants are given legitimate profits, the "shortage" phenomenon is not difficult to solve. Merchants calculate profits on the up and down, and unscrupulous profiteers do not hesitate to withdraw goods from the market and transfer them to the black market for profit. If they happen to meet a patron with a sentimental attachment to the past, they praise the black market goods and are grateful that no one is willing to report the "friend" who helped them, causing them to fall into prison. This makes the black market even more rampant. While the management authorities should punish merchants who sell on the black market, it seems that customers who buy black market goods should also be given appropriate punishment. Make the people know that anti-profiteering and stabilizing prices are their own business, and that they must all work together.</p>
