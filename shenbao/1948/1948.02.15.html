<h3 id="c1">美國两次救濟物资　六月初全部運抵華　對華貸款傳將輪出商貨 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕美國務院今日宣布，去年十二月國會通過聯總結束後對華救濟計劉一千八百萬美元中，現已規定以一千三百萬美元作爲購米之用，此等二次撥款，使美國在聯總結束後對華之救濟總額，計達四千五百七十萬美元，首次撥款二千七百七十萬美元，乃去年七月通過者。據國務院官員披露，上述二次計劃之物資，定六月一日左右全部運抵中國，俾分配於中國沿海五大都市之事宜，能於六月卅日計劃時效屆滿前完成，一千八百萬美元之分配如下；一千三百另八萬七千美元購買食米四萬七千七百五十二噸，此數代表今年首六個月內美國分配予中國之食米總數之百分之八十四。二百廿八萬二千美元購買美麥一萬八千六百噸，此數代表二月份及三月份美國分配予中國之小麥配數量，一百萬美元購買醫藥供應品，四十三萬一千美元，購買雜穀，玉蜀黍種籽及一十萬美元購買殺虫劑，另有一百萬美元作為購買在中國境內運輪救濟物資所需之石油及柴油之準備。國務院又披露，依照第一次計圖撥予中國之小麥五萬噸，業已分批運出，其中若干已運抵中國，全部食米四萬三千五百噸，定三月上旬完全運出，現已運出者有九千，二月份擬運二萬噸。第二次計劃之其他物資，將立即網之運出，混合穀種二千噸，將分配予旱災及水災區之農民，以增加糧食生產。美官員解釋稱：購買醫藥供應品之一百萬美元與第十次計劃下之醫藥供應品無涉，此一百萬美元，乃用作補充第一次計劃者，如有餘款時，得移作購買食米之用，上述官員述及最近外間指責國務院躭擱第一次計劃運輸一事時稱，運輸計劃及其日期，乃中國政府與駐滬美國救濟品分配代表團會商後，完全協議者。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日電〕據美國商務週報稱：美國擬貸予中國之五億七千萬美元，將循商業途徑，其方法由私人出口商將貨物輸出美國，再由私人進口商將貨物運入由國，再將貨物淸單交付中國政府，而由政府分配此項物資，如此事屬實，則可證明美國對外貿易商人爲要求參加執行援華計劃而施之壓力已獲結果。該報並稱：日本或可以價値一千萬美元之鐵路器材供應粵漢路。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕華盛頓新聞報今日辯論國務院援華計劃稱，五億七千萬元之數，並不毀象長期計劃之一部份，大多數主張援華者認爲三年之期乃任何積極計劃之最低限度。無論數目多少，無論期限久暫，中國脆弱已極，須有分配與管制援助之最大技巧，方能收效。勝利以來中國所得美援，浪費太多。蔣主席當歡迎有效的管制，但共目的須在增强而非削弱中國政府。援助之方法與數量同其重要。國務部計劃絕不提及軍事援助，此爲最顯著之忽略，須知蔣主席之軍隊須得美國軍火與物資，尤須美國陸空軍敎官。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕卅七年度國際貿易計劃，經部已着手草擬，內容將包括四部份，甲·增加輸出，爭取國外市塲。乙·改善輸入，使外匯充分利用於發展中國經濟。丙，保護國內工業。丁。推廣商品檢驗範圍，使我國貨品適合國外市塲需要。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕卅七年度對日貿易輸出入計劃表，對日貿易指委會十四日下午舉行第十二次例會時，已予通過。該項計劃表之擬訂，係應駐日盟軍總部之請求，由全經會，經部，財部，資委會，輸管會，中信局等機關負責，中經多次審查，於十四日上午舉行綜合審查會審定，下午提出對日貿易指委會通過。依計劃表中所列我國提出之對日貿易輸出貨品，將以豬鬃，桐油，羊毛等爲最重要，希望日本輸入之貨品，則以機器及工業原料爲主，並依照去年所公布之對日貿易計劃綱要，祥細列舉輸出入貨品之種類，此項計劃表俟報請政院核准後，即可提交駐日盟軍總部，供麥帥參考。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十四日電〕日政府之堅決要求交換我國之鐵礦及焦煤，使來日計劃與日本締結大批貿易合同之我國商人無法進行工作，我商人自三週前抵日以來，迄尙未與日本商業行號訂立任何合同，各代表對兩國間之私人貿易，前途感覺　淡。據稱：彼等目前雖繼續與日本貿易廳及總部進行交涉，然即使訂有何種合同，亦非大規模者。日政府計劃輸往中國機器織物及雜貨等中國所需要之貨品，惟不欲與不能供應日本工業所必需之物品之中國商人從事交易，鐵礦及焦煤爲日本對其輸出品所不求換回之唯一物品，然此二者目前均由中國政府嚴爲管制。中國商人所能供應之物品，如大蔴及漆，均屬總部及日貿易廳所視爲非必需者，貿易廳雖可能批准少數關於此種非必需品之合同，中國商人認爲本年成交總數當在一百萬美元以下，據記者所獲日政府機密文件，日本本年除輸華之化學藥品及農產品外，每年擬輸往華中華南價値一千萬美元之機器與雜貨，其中包括紡織機三百具，馬達一千具，一萬九千匹馬力之柴油機，人造絲三百六十萬磅，報紙五千噸，縫衣機三千具，毯五百萬條。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕美宣布新輸出許可政策，第一批限制出口物品計達四百餘種，經部已予密切注意，此項限制出口之物品表，已由駐美大使館商務參事劉大鈞寄達經部，經部現正研究中。十三日上午由經次童季齡邀集有關各部會代表，舉行首次會商，外部，財部，輸管會，全經會，交部，農部，中信局等均派有代表參加，研討美實行新輸出許可政策對我國際貿易所加之影響，並籌商對策，會中對於美國限制出口物品之限額及我國所需要輸入物資之數量，以及外匯所能使用於輸入物資之數目均曾談及，惟係初步廣泛交換意見，尙無結論，日內將再舉行會議，籌商適當辦法。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約十三日電〕本地出口商對於我國最近减少進口額之措施之初步反響，認爲中國顯欲保存其美金準備，此間美國商務部發言人稱：南京方面减少進口額一舉，顯欲限制美國對華之輸出額。威廢享特公司總經理享特謂：鑒於中國外匯準備所受之負担减少進口額一舉，無驚奇之處，而此舉表示對此爲戰爭所蹂躪之報國，應立即予以有效之援助。此間工商協會稱：若被减少之進口額，不包括尙未輸華之美國貨物，則其對於運往中國之出口之影響尙小，某貿易方面人士認爲，南京方面之聲明，極合時宜，並可能加速國會對於援華計劃之通過，同時，甚多出口商刻正等待獲悉中國進口新規則所限制之貨物之詳情。</p>

<h3 id="c30">看日本的閣潮 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>執政了入個多月的日本片山內閣，終於正式宣吿垮台了。凡稍稍留心一些日本問題的，對於片山內閣的垮台，大抵認爲意中事。每年二月前後，本來是日本的「政治季節」，片山哲以社曾黨黨魁的身份走上政治舞台的時候，骨子裏是偏於保守，故迎社會黨內部意志尙未能統一，其不能安渡此政治季節，情勢顯然。我們看看他執政八個月又十天的政績，可以說平淡異常，無所建樹，至其終於被迫辭職，也可以說是早已注定的了。</p>
<p>我們研究此中原因，最基本的就是執政的社會黨並非國會中佔有過半數議席的大黨。社會黨於去年四月普選中，雖獲得選民的擁戰，名義上成爲日本第一大黨，但是它所獲得的議席未能超過半數，一直到片山內閣辭職之日，日本衆議院各黨派勢力的分配，依然是這樣的：社會黨一百二十三席，自由黨一百十九席，民主黨一百零二席，國民協同黨三十二席，同志會二十二席，全農派十六席，第一議員俱樂部十五席，農民黨七席，共產黨四席，無黨派者二席，空缺二十席。片山旣不能組織淸一色的社會黨內閣，自不得不拉攏其他三大政黨，組織四黨聯合內閣，因此在政策上也就不得不作相當的讓步。同時，聯合內閣的組成又不十分澈底，一方面片山哲拒絕社會黨左派入閣，另一方面自由黨黨魁古田又拒不入閣，寗願凡在野第一大政黨自居。所以片山內閣先天就是平庸無能，且早就潛伏着內部分裂的危機。在過去八個多月之中，不僅時常遭受到在野的自由黨的攻擊，而且在朝的各黨派也貌合神離，常常意見相左，故其政治基礎，沒有一天不在風雨　搖之中。到了本月十日第二屆議會復會，「政治季節」開始，片山內閣雖也力權掙扎，但是民主黨黨魁蘆田均，終與片山意見相左，贊成內閣　辭職，於是片山內閣不得不出於總辭職之一途。誠如片山發表聲明稱：「內　今日之總辭戰，係聯合內閣必然難免的結果。余就日本民主政治之發展上未曾有一點錯談，堪自慶幸；尤其極力避免解散衆議院，而使內閣總辭職，係對於國內外政治情勢予以公正判斷之結果。至於今後內閣，在無絕多數黨的現狀下，余認爲組織聯合內悶較爲妥當。」</p>
<p>但是在片山內閣總辭職之後，究將由何人繼起組閣？這一個問題，當爲各國人士所注意。截至執筆時止，我們尙不敢輕下斷語。衆議院議長松岡於獲悉內閣總辭職之後，即分別訪晤民主黨蘆田，社會黨片山，及協同黨三木，交換組閣意見，三黨魁一致同意召開四黨黨魁會議，而松圖往訪自由黨總裁吉田時，吉田却認爲自由黨旣爲在野的第一大政黨，當然應該繼起組閣執政；即使組織四黨聯合內閣，自由黨也應該取得目相地位。依照一憲政常軌」，吉田理應被提名爲下屆首相；參議院中也有表示贊成的。惟環顧左右的情勢，對於吉田的東山再起，目前似尙非其時。第一，吉田所領導的保守新黨運動，迄今尙未成熟，此際即出而組閣，朱免言之渦早。第二，麥帥對於新黨遝動，不僅表示反對，而且有時採取壓抑手段。盟總代表對於繼任人選會有聲明：「倘片山內閣辭職，在目前日本沒有多數黨可以繼之組織內閣的時候，只有由各黨派在議會中協商　　　合內閣；協議不成，那末只有解散議會，以決定由下屆　會中的多數黨組織新內閣。依我個人的見解，頗不贊同目前所　的新黨運動。」在今日的日本，盟總的暗示，不啻就是一種有力的訓令，不論吉田如何善於應付，但終無法克服這一個黨大障礙的。所以依現情勢推測，大家都認爲首相人選以民主黨蘆田的可能性爲最大。</p>
<p>董田也是主張聯合社會，自由，民主，協同組織四黨聯合內　的，民主黨幹部會議十二日決定，排擊對社會黨左派之容忍政策，而努力尋求與自由黨之妥協點；而且目前的政治形勢也有利於蘆田。麥帥早已聲明：「日本政治問題的解決，將聽由日本人民決定。」在無意之中，巳表示出贊成蘆田組閣的意向。但是我們知這，民主黨在衆議院中所處的地位，不僅不如社會黨，而且也不及自由黨。蘆田企圖紙織四黨聯合內閣，若不能取得自由黨的合作與支持，則其組閣的政治基礎，將比片山內閣尤爲孱弱，更要不安定，即使免强組成內閣，也無前途可言的。目前日本的政局，紊亂到極點，不僅造成小黨林立的形勢，而在意識上各黨互相齟齬，也極盡紊亂之奇觀。</p>
<p>日本內閣的難產，不僅已使盟總深感焦慮，並已警吿日本政黨不得以大黨壓迫小黨。而且在片山本人，對於下屆首相的人選，也說「不得而知」。所以展望日本閣潮，方興未艾，吉田與蘆田角逐，勢均力敵，頗有兩敗俱傷的可能，最後恐將由片山再度組織聯合內閣。此則由社會黨日來努力於左右兩派之統一工作，可以窺見其端倪。因爲片山內閣之總辭，其根本原因在於社會然內部之分裂，故分裂現象如一旦眞能消除，則以社會黨爲重心之三黨聯合內閣自然仍有死灰復燃之可能。</p>
<h3 id="c31">中共電臺廣播　要求美軍撤退　否則不優待被俘美兵 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>〔合眾社舊金山十三日電〕中共電台十三日之廣播，一般認爲無異乃要求美國海軍及陸戰隊離華之最後通牃。中共廣播中同時並要求，美國保證對國民政府不再作援助，以爲自去年聖誕節後爲共黨俘虜之四美海軍陸戰隊予以寬大待通之交換條件。彼等於聖誕日自美海軍西太平洋總部靑島出外打獵時失踪，被焚燬之吉普車，則在靑島北卅三哩近萊陽城之處被發現。據合衆社所收得之其黨廣播稱，該四美海軍陸戰隊之被俘，由於彼等協助國軍作戰，並繼稱，「膠東人民解放軍」之總部業已對美駐華海軍提出强硬抗議，要求這歉，並保證以後不得再有此項行動，否則美海軍及美國政府應負此項行動之後果之全部責任，如美海軍當局接受此項正當之要求，則「解放軍」將以中美人民間之友好精神，寬大待遇被捕之美海軍陸戰隊。該度播在列舉美國積極以軍事援助中國政府，發生無數意外事件以後稱：「爲避免再發生此項意外，美國武裝力量以及軍事人員應立即自中國撤退」。</p>
<p>中共電台稱，此五名海軍陸戰隊乃在萊陽附近協助國軍作戰時被俘者。其中一名，名布來敦者，在作戰中受傷，已死於戰地醫院中。</p>
<p>然當彼等失踪時，美駐華海軍總部曾宣稱此四名陸戰隊實爲出外打獵者。彼等所携者爲獵槍，而非如共方所稱之步槍，第五名則未得允許私自參加者。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕據此間今晨收得共匪之廣播稱，去年十一月二日靑島美海軍陸戰隊失踪之美兵五人，其一已被擊斃，其餘四人，刻仍爲山東共匪之俘虜，被擊斃者爲列兵布來敦，其餘四人爲下士陶拉德，一等兵狄克遜，列兵哈特及一等兵賈博迪斯特利亞。美使館新聞處長梅爾璧今晨吿記者稱：該廣播所稱五人於去年在離渠等之司令部一百華里之地方被俘，係因積極帮助國軍作戰之故，一說絕非事實。該五人係在行獵中被捕者。該廣播續稱，中共爲此曾向美駐華海軍當局提出極嚴厲抗議，要求後者道歉，並保證以後不再有類似情形發生。該抗議並表示，如美海軍當局接受此項要求，則中共將予被俘之四美軍以寬容待遇。梅氏於接見記者時並稱，渠並未聞及有關任何對美駐華海軍當局提出抗議之爭。此次所聞，係五人失踪後首次新獲關於彼等之消息。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕參院外交委員會今日以十三對零票，通過四年援歐法案，規定最初十二個月經費為五十三億元。杜魯門總統曾要求最初十五個月經費爲六十八億元。外委會主席范登堡稱，此次削减由於「時間表變更」而非减少凈數。以十五個月爲一期，今予以縮總，可使新國會（意即十一月大選後的新國會）有機會對援歐計劃實施情形，及平作現實的檢討，然後表決必要追加經費。法案原文尙有少數細則須待整理，方能脫稿。但今日之決議，已解決最後重大問題，預料下星期內即可提付參院討論。共和電參議員塔虎脫及該黨其他議員，要求大刀闊斧削减，塔氏士張削减二十億元。范登堡並稱，此項法案規定由建設銀團墊款十億元作爲開辦費，俾在國會討論個別撥款法案時，經費不致無着落。其時效至一九五二年六月底爲止，此即政府所要求者求至於運輸工具，則該法案規定一折衷辦法，准許參加援歐計劇各國租用美國輪船三百艘。政府所要求者則爲出售輪船二百艘及出租三百艘，海運公會與其他團體曾表示反對。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十四日電〕從各方跡象觀之，該案於三月一日提交參院時，將發生一塲「擊倒，拖長」之劇鬥。塔虎脫承認該院較國務部原擬者大見進步，然本人仍認爲數額過高。修改份子集團揚言將策劃議塲戰略。援歐方案之其他障碍物，尙有兩院之撥款委會，此兩委會操有基金總額之生死權柄。</p>

<p>〔合衆社伊沃華州台莫尼十三日電〕國務卿馬歇爾十三日晚盛譽建議中之西歐政治聯盟，並稱，此乃吾人極大之希望。馬氏並警吿稱，馬歇爾計劃成功，乃世界避免共黨主宰之最後機曾。馬歇爾之專機在丹納西州之諾克斯維勒城停留後，由無綫電向麋集此間之全國農村研究之聽衆發表演說。馬氏在其演辭中，對英外相貝文最近建議之英法及其他國家之「西歐聯盟」，作第一次之直接評述。</p>
<p>〔路透社電〕馬歇爾云，「我美國人民今正面臨驗史上最重大的決議，對整個世界均將有遠大的影饗，此猶如其他一切的重大決議，一經決定即不得變更，不容有再猜一次的機　。今日吾人對我外交政策所將採取的重大決議，係按照美　方式而爲之，然此處有一危險之點，即吾人恐將過份注意細則方面，因而忽略歐洲復興方案之最主要目標。吾人應使此一方案之目標及其與世界未來的關係，瞭若指掌。此一方　係代表具體領導制的偉大努力，採用以後，將爲世界文明　表上吾人最偉大的歷史性傑作，苟無錯誤，則其成敗的結果將決定世界的生存，俾使民主自由經濟安定及和平得以維持。</p>
<p>蘇聯及其共產同志金圖利用戰後危機，以取得控制全歐的勢力，西歐苟有穩國健全的局面，則蘇聯領袖必能更顯成立和約條件的協議。國會不久即將採取決議，將決定長期內的歷史及我國未來的命運。就余個人意見而言，余以爲吾人正處交叉路？吾人前途有兩條路綫可循：吾人可以決定歐洲復興方案的困難及危險太大，因此不必有所作爲；吾人亦可以一半心情及不適當的局勢，應付當前局勢。就後者言，其效果等於無所作爲，但同時仍須付出浩大的代價。較物質的效果更爲最嚴重者，乃爲對於美國領導地位心理上的不信任。吾人如果採取此一決議，西歐不免處於目前東歐所遭的同一控制之下其在每一國所採取的方法或有不同，但結果則一。在此等條件之下，自由制度在歐洲大陸上，將許久不得存在。本人於去歲莫期科會議失敗後，即曾表示美國政府握有世界公認的領導地位，可以採取若千積極行動以挽救局勢。過去吾人所採的消極態度，不能再予容忍。當時之此項決議，乃有巴黎十六國會議之召開，成爲建立和平世界最重大的一步。最近英外相貝文的建議表示歐洲國家又再進一步越過經濟合作的協議，以考慮西歐聯盟。此一發展，實乃吾人偉大的希望，希望我美國人民權衡國內得失與歐洲復興方案目標之輕重。想所有美國人民均信美國乃世界最强大的國家，吾人必須爲世界各處人民謀取更好的生活，吾人負有重大的責任，領袖有領導之責，局勢愈爲危急，領袖有採取行動更大的必要，此本人今日所要求於全國人士者也」。</p>

<p>法國認爲歐洲的範團，起於大西洋地中海，直抵烏拉爾山，爲基督人道精神所籠罩，然今日歡洲的傳統文明，僅由參加馬歇爾方案的十六國代表。歐洲的分裂應由蘇聯負責，分裂的結果乃極大的不幸，但法國並不接受目前的分裂已爲最後狀態。皮氏於述及英法問之聯繫時，表示法政府極度歡迎貝文外相最近的建議。法國願與任何具有同一觀念的歐洲國家舉行討論。皮氏述及德國問題時，認爲應永遠消除德國可能侵駱，德國東疆的觀念唯一解決辦法，乃爲使德國參加歐洲集團，建立不具侵略意志的和平德國。皮氏並力言法國對於經濟援助之不具任何成見，指出他國若能以同樣獨立的條件，建議對法援助，則法國亦樂於接受。皮杜爾並提出警吿稱，上次世界大戰中之勝利者，欲使德國分裂爲二，不失爲一危臉的進戲。法國堅決反對德國過去的重新建立，法國決不使俾斯麥式的德國再滬，法國主張有效管制，但亦從未反對德國經濟復具，惟覺德國之經濟復興不能較鄕邦享受優先權而已。</p>

<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>政策在慌張中發生了轉變</p>
<p>一九四〇年間，我們的對蘇關係是爲一種願望所左右，就是我們不願做什麼事情致使它更投入德國的懷抱，同時又設法限制我們對蘇聯的輸出在某一限度之內，使它不致有剩餘的軍用原料可以轉運到德國去。</p>
<p>由於戰爭的關係，蘇聯已無法獲致好多種軍用原料，很想和美國保持貿易關係。但是它不明瞭我們爲什麼不一直張開了變手接納它。</p>
<p>有時候，它要求不可能的事情。它設法了好幾個月想從美國的造船商購買一艘戰艦。總統和我願意爲它建造一艘，但是蘇聯堅持美國最新式的裝置和發明必須包括在內。海軍可以同意建造一艘至少和我們現在所有的一樣新式的戰艦，但是當然不願意把幾年來美國經精心研究後所獲得的最新秘密全部給予蘇聯人，其中一部份秘密正在裝置於當時我們正在建造的新戰艦之中。</p>
<p>一九四〇年四月二日，我和奧曼斯基大他曾就美蘇關係作一次明白的討論。奧曼斯基是我們從來遇到的外國外交家中最難應付者之一。他的態度和言詞常帶侮辱性質，凡是碰到了我們中間的任何人，總是敵對的，彷彿他天生有這種能力一樣。他出言不遜，要求讓步時彷彿是一種當然的權利，抗議我們的行動時彷彿它們是極惡劣的過失。在我看來，他對美蘇關係曾造成不少損害。</p>
<p>奧受斯基這一次來看我的時候，是有許多的事情要訴苦的。他開始談話時就列舉了許多所謂不平之事。他指出若干美國公司拒不准許蘇聯工程師或準備採購貨物者視察它們的工廠；若干稍有地位的蘇聯男女人士領了臨時護照到美國來的被拘留於埃里斯島遷延不放；以及我們的道德禁運（有關蘇芬戰爭的）。於是他就直率地問我國政府究竟想繼續或放棄對蘇聯的商業關係。</p>
<p>我立定主意不表示任何意見。</p>
<p>於是，他就提出一點，說道德禁運是祗適用於蘇聯的。</p>
<p>我向他表明這適用於從事轟炸平民的一切國家。</p>
<p>奧受斯基否認他的國家從事於轟炸平民。</p>
<p>我回答說，「我們有圾滿意的證據可以證明蘇聯的確是轟炸平民的。鑒於你討論這件事情時所用的語與，我知道我不能使你相信我的說法猶如你不能使我相信相反的說法一樣。」</p>
<p>大使每一次想說明他的政府之和平意向時，我總設法給他一種印象，就是我表示懷疑。</p>
<p>談話繼續近一小時，奧受斯基總結說，他的政府無意干涉羅馬尼亞東部的貝薩拉比亞省，該省在一九一四—一九一八年戰爭之前是屬於俄羅斯的；蘇聯不大相信土耳其會參與協約國千涉巴庫油區；蘇聯對於近東任何部份並無企圖；但是他避免涉及有關芬蘭和德國的題目。</p>
<p>五月二十九日，我打電報給我國駐蘇大使館，要求將集有關蘇軍向羅馬尼亞邊界移動的情報。美國駐羅公使根室曾打電報吿訴我，說沿羅馬尼亞邊境有大批蘇聯軍隊集中。羅馬尼亞方面相信史達林爲德軍在西方的勝利所震驚，正設法獲得羅馬尼亞的領土，俾在和希特勒談判時，可以有更好的討價還價張本。他們提到過羅馬尼亞東部的貝薩拉比亞省。</p>
<p>在我們駐莫斯科的代辦塞斯頓會晤莫洛托夫外長之後，他在五月三十一日打電報給我說，莫洛托夫對美國極表不滿。他對於美國公司取消蘇聯定貨一點尤爲憤怒，說是不友好和不能容忍的。當塞斯頓說明爲了國防上的理由我們也在徵發其他政府的定貨所以並不對蘇聯有所歧視的時候，莫洛托夫的火氣更大了。他說我們沒有權力可以修改政府之間交往的正常方法，我們的行動是不合法和不可容忍的；我們對此必須負全部責任，這對我們不會有好處。</p>
<p>但在六月初，塞斯頓開始吿訴我們蘇聯政府對協約國的態度有所轉變。莫斯科爲德軍的迅速推進所龍驚，現在希望法國繼續作戰了。先前莫斯科是支持法國共產黨阻撓雷諾政府的活動的。</p>
<p>蘇大使奧曼斯基在他最惡劣的時候簡直是侮辱的化身，他在六月十二日來看我。我知道他要就一樁事情提出抗議，那就是我們自己的政府爲了國防的關係正在接收先前由他的政府所定的機械工具。我對於他和國務院其他官員就此一問題所舉行的許多次會議以及他當時所採用的出言不遜的語調，頗爲熟悉，所以這一次我就自己來開始這個討論。</p>
<p>我在提起了我們爲求與傾向和平的每一個其他國家協力—特別是希望獲得蘇聯的協力—而作的許多努力之後，接着說：「當我們看到所有這些努力完全徒然的時候，內心眞有說不出的失習和遺憾。在這種倩形之下，我的政府已經開始一個武裝，武裝，不斷武裝的新政策，藉以保衛自己反抗任何可能的敵人。我的政府以此爲目的，毫不猶豫地收集必要的物資，不然就保存對於我們日以繼夜的軍備計劃所必要的一切商品。</p>
<p>我最後說我們未能獲得蘇聯較在已往七年間更充份更展泛的合作一點，極爲失望。</p>
<p>奧曼斯　開始講到在他說來是我國政府正在實行的貿易歧視。我當即打斷他說：</p>
<p>「鑒於現行的緊急局勢，我爲你的政府注意這樣小的爭執，不勝驚奇。你的政府在貿易方法上在優待其他國家，對我們實行歧視，我們一無話說。這包括以大量軍用供應品運到德國去。」</p>
<p>奧曼斯基指出這是通常的貿易。</p>
<p>我回答說，「無論和何其中包括戰爭所急需的大量供應品，此點使它和通常的貿易大不相同。當然，以我國政府而言，蘇聯是具有進行此種貿易的充份權利的。但是在義阿戰爭的時候，我們對義國就採取了一個極不相同的政策，當時我們用道德禁運的方式把我們的貿易抑低到戰前的水準。但是我主要的論點，是在說明我們保存原料以增加軍備的現行政策。」</p>
<p>繼而我說，爲了我們極懇切希望蘇聯能對和平發揮重大的影饗，所以總統在蘇聯侵攻芬蘭之前極願出面斡旋。</p>
<p>奧曼斯甚用相當諷刺的口吻說—諷刺從大使的嘴裏會脫口而出猶如委從打穀機中流出一樣—是的，但是他的政府對於當時總某一次的演說，反映並不甚隹。他是指總統責難蘇聯侵略芬蘭而言。</p>
<p>我回答說，「當一個龐大的國家緊握了一個渺小無助的國家的喉嚨要它室息而死的時候，我必須汝認這個大國的政府對於我們的斡旋是不會有良好的反應或者有所行動的。在這種情形之下，唯一的辦法，就是儘量保持緘默。</p>
<p>大使似乎有些不安，但是並沒有作答。</p>
<p>想起了幾天之前莫洛托夫在莫斯科對寒斯頓代辦所作激烈傲慢的談話，以及大使在華感頓一有機會就高聲侮辱，我就表示意見說：</p>
<p>「莫洛托夫先生似乎很「趾高氣揚」。我在華盛頓又不時聽到莫洛托夫先生的代表出首不遜的談話。七年來，我為謀與蘇聯保持多少可以過得去的關係並望予以改善，受盡了尖刻的批評，而所得的酬報似乎就是如此。」</p>
<p>當奧曼斯基繼續申說其不滿時，我就說我可以列舉一大串對蘇聯衷心覺得不滿意的事情，但是我不願意比我已經說過的說得更多了。他要求我——毋寗說是迫我——說出一些我所想得起的。剛巧史丹因哈特大使已經從莫斯科回到了華盛頓，替我寫了好幾頁關於對蘇聯不滿意的事情，而這幾頁東西就在我手頭。於是我就讀了史丹因哈特指責各點的第一頁，並且說我還可以讀好幾頁，但是不願讀了。</p>
<p>最後我再提到我爲求與蘇聯友好相處而作的冗長和誠懇的努力，並且說：「凡在蘇聯認爲適當的情形之下，我國政府將樂於恢復採取一套政策，以謀用每一種切實的辦法來更充份地發展和平關係與相互有利的合作。我們對蘇聯的貿易，比較上是小的，假如過份誇張我們對它特別重視，實屬錯誤，但是我們願意保持這種貿易並予以發展，祗要這種發展是我們兩國可以互相接受的關係之下進行就得了。」</p>
<p>幾乎就在進行這次談話的時候，我開始從我國駐愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞和立陶宛的代表收到電報，報吿蘇聯要求由蘇軍完全佔領這幾個國家，各該國政府應實行改組俾對蘇聯更爲友好。波羅的海各國不得不答應。蘇軍的佔領就在六月十五日開始。</p>
<p>此一行動的一個理田，是很明顯的；史達林爲對付德國，希望獲得一個更好的防衛地位。我國駐拉脫維亞公使費築於六月十九日打電報給我說，據可靠的消息靈通人士消息，克列姆林方面對於最近的發展異常担心，簡直有些不知所從。史達林的政策是建立在西方長期消耗戰的假定上的。法國崩潰之後，這個政策也隨之崩潰了。希特勒最近聲明他並不希望毀滅英帝國，目的在誘使英國提出和平建議，可是蘇聯却慌張不堪了，深恐西歐的問題將以蘇聯爲代價而獲得解決。</p>
<p>在蘇聯佔領波羅的海各國兩星期之後，她又在歐洲採取另一防禦措置，佔領了羅馬尼亞的貝薩拉比亞省和布柯維那省的一部份。我國駐布哈萊斯特公使根室在五月間向我表示的恐懼，現已成爲事實。現在，蘇聯西南部國境的防禦地位增强了。波羅的海各國和羅馬尼亞領土的佔領，已經拉直了它西部邊境的弧形。</p>
<p>我國代表從各地發來的電報，指出一個結論，就是蘇聯此等行動事前簡直沒有通知希特勒政府。德蘇關係現在開始呈現緊張了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會，地政局，國民黨市黨部，總予留，市商會，房地產業同業公會，地方法院等七機關團體他表，昨日下午三時，在地政局商議本市房屋租金標準問題，根據搜集之市府統計處編製工人，職員及公敎人員生活指數中房租指數等資料，交換意見，認爲過去房租標準以倍數計算，不能適應實際，決定原則不訂固定性之倍數，而參照生活指數予以折扣計算。該項指數究係按照工人，職員，抑或公敎人員，三種中何者一種，未作決定，但無論如何必須打一極大折扣。會中各代表並一致認爲公敎人員收入不多，其所租賃之房屋，按照指數計算，折扣應時別多打。齊本市房租約可分爲三類：（一）營業房屋，按照指數所打折扣較少。（二）住宅房屋，所打折扣較多。（三）公敎人員住屋，租金按照指數計算，所打折扣更多。據地政局長祝平與記者談：商討房租標準之基本原因係由於房荒，故會中決定爲獎勵建築，新蓋房屋之房租應不受限制，藉以促進房屋之建築。七機關團體代表商定之原則，及將採用何種生活指數，暨折扣多寡問題，尙須提送市政會議討論，再送市參議會核議。希望與論界及市民對此問題，多多提供意見，以期所訂之本市房租標準，不僅合理，且能適應實際。</p>
<p>按三十六年十二月份本市職員生活指數中房屋指數爲一萬五千六百倍。工人指數中房屋類爲四萬六千四百倍（包括水電煤柴等）。公敎人員指數中房屋指數爲九千一百四十倍。</p>

<p>（三）被告張寶匯部分：</p>
<p>查張寳匯在海關輸入許可證核對股之關員中階級最低，經本院訊據略稱「怡豐行鍍鋅鐵片之入口，先由岳新民說起，我說商人的委託可不管，他說梅福堂等威脅，我說你可辭職，後來岳找張淵帮忙，聽說尹主任（指尹蘭蓀）也答應了，後來張淵送美金一千五百元，此乃環境使然」云云。尹是對於共同藉端勒索財物一節，狡不直承，且稱尹蘭孫始終反對，嗣因解除岳新民受梅福堂。張高振之脅迫，才勉强爲之，故於貨物提去後，尹囑我將許可證上下兩端簽字處剪掉了，以免發現何人核准」等語。果爾則各被吿不獨未向人勒索，且被人脅過，殊不近情，况關員尹蘭蓀等及所勾通之卸職關員張淵，扣留單體，迭令張高振輾轉經由梅福堂。沈彥祿。方茂林及毛豐翔等，每經過一人，必扣留一次，增索一次，迨陸根泉因受其重疊勒索之後，始獲領回單證，已在前開關於尹蘭蓀部分叙明，其索得美金八千元，又與尹蘭蓀同共俵分之數額，其爲分担藉端勒索財物之實施行爲，已堪認定。至剪毀許可證，固爲消滅刑事證據，然爲其犯罪行爲當然結果，依法不另論罪。</p>
<p>再利豐永顏料案訊據：略稱「利豐永是三十六年八月十四日報關，在是月二十七日奉令注意之前，不必先交尹主任（指尹關蓀），由我初核，尹復核，得了七千萬，天和太康案我並未要錢民富燒碱案，得了美金三千元，羊毛案亦未得錢」云云，然核其自白書略載，「民每向張淵聲明遇事須得主任（指尹蘭蓀）許可，張淵致酬，不與計較，並聲明至多點綴一點即可。至陳良編報關之燒碱案，因與陳有遠親關係，碍於情面，經張（指張淵）陳商得尹主任同意後，分得三五千元美金，後又退至五百元美金」（見局卷第二本九九頁）云云不符，足見前叙「未得錢」及未要錢各陳述，均係臨審遁飾，不可採信，觀其「至多點綴一點即可」之語，顯係概括犯意，其爲共同連續違背職務，收受賄賂無疑。</p>
<p>（四）被告張淵部分：</p>
<p>本院訊得張淵略稱「怡豐白鐵皮案，經岳新民拿來證件，特與尹蘭蓀審核，謂須送輸管會研究，呌我退還許可證件，後岳新民文來美金五千元，岳新民獨得美金三千元，呌我抽出五百元，散給碼頭上的人，尹蘭蓀才簽發單證准其輸入。民與尹蘭蓀。張寳匯各分美金一千五百元，又利豐永安尼林油案，送來三億三千萬，天和大康顏料案，送來法幣九千萬，益豐行羊毛案送來三億元，民分了一億與尹蘭蓀·張寳匯。至民富公司燒碱案，共分美金一萬六千元，法幣一億二千萬元，民與尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張寬匯四人，各分美金三千元，其餘四千元之美金及一億二千萬法幣，開銷碼頭了。」核與曾在保密局與本院檢察處偵查中之迭次自白，大致相符，並與卷附各證件，亦無二致。是其以非公務員與公務員共同勒索　根泉之金錢，及連續在尹蘭蓀。岳新民。張寳匯共同連續違背職務收受賄賂行爲中參與受賄之實施，毫無疑義。再對於陳良綱在許可證內添塡燒碱之行爲，先商得其同意，亦據陳良絗陳明，足見事前爲精神上之帮助，不過此乃參與上開運背職務收受賄賂之方法，應從較重之宣汚罪論斷。</p>
<p>該被吿尹蘭蓀。岳新民。張　匯，以關員身分，藉端勒案陸根泉之金錢，利用卸職關員張淵，爲之過付分担實施，卒得美金八千元朋分，（帮助犯方茂林等所分美金五千三百六十元，當不在內，應另案辦理），殊屬罪大惡極。張淵雖非公務員，然與之共犯，依法應負同一罪責。尹蘭蓀。岳新民。張淵。均應各處死刑，張寳匯在海關關員中階級較低，因迫於尹蘭蓀·岳新民及張淵之情勢，參與實施，經本院察言觀色，且含悔意，自可貸其一死，量處無期徒刑，均各褫奪公權終身。又該被吿尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張寳匯，以關員身分，概括犯意，連續數行爲，共同對於違背職務之行爲，收受賄賂，應以一罪論。張淵雖非公務員，然依上開說明，亦應與尹蘭蓀等負同一之罪責，故各量處死刑。張寳匯情節較輕，有如前述，故量處無期徒刑，並各褫奪公權終身。</p>
<p>查被吿等所犯上述兩罪，旣無概括犯意，又非同一罪名，應合併處罰，檢察官起訴，一概認爲連續犯，係犯對於違背職務之行爲，收受賄賂一罪，本院自應於變更其法條後分別論罪科刑，並定其應執行之刑，被吿尹蘭蓀。岳新民。張淵均各執行死刑。張寳匯執行無期徒刑，並各執行褫奪公權終身。其由勒索所得財物，計美金一萬三千三百六十元，則除帮助犯方茂林等所得五千三百六十元另案辦理，及張淵所繳一千二百二十五元，經由國防部保密局發交陸根泉具領外，其餘六千七百七十五元，按照當時每元市價九萬倍，折合法幣六億零九百七十五元，及所收賄款總計法幣十五億零五百萬，由各被吿連帶負責繳案，分別發還沒收（二十九年院字第一一二四號解釋文參照），再發還部分，業據被害人陸根泉聲請合併說明。</p>
<p>據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第二條第一項第二項刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條第二百九十二條，懲治貪污條例第一條第一項第二條第四款第七款第七條第一項第十三條，刑法第二十八條第五十條第五十六條第五十一條第一款第三款第八款第三十七條第一項第三項判決如主文。</p>

<p>〔本報南昌九“航訊〕浙贛鐵路南昌上饒段復路工程，最後艱苦的部分梁家渡大橋，已於本月三日完成，第一列由上饒來南昌的列車，是三日中午試車完竣，下午一時通過大橋，路遠南昌。</p>
<p>「通車第一」，是浙贛路員工的一個信條，他們用刻苦耐勞的精神克服多種困難，完成「路」「橋」工程。</p>
<p>全段里程概況</p>
<p>全段的里程，由上饒到向塘一一九公里，分四個總段，十二個分段，三十八座橋，和二十三個車站，在趕工的目標下，各項工程，現在僅是完成一個粗型，還有六十八公里的鋼軌，有的是三十五磅，或是五十五，六十，六十三磅的各種各樣的輕鋼凑合舖成，票房與行車的設備，有的岔道尙未舖滿，月台亦未竣工，或是僅有幾樣簡陋的辦公用具，現在全段沒一站有電燈裝備，和完成票房各項佈置。行車的電話，路籤，揚旗，里程牌等，亦正在加工趕製。</p>
<p>大橋修建過程</p>
<p>梁家渡大橋工程，在浙贛路全綫上，僅次于樟樹的贛江大橋。在民國廿八年五月因戰時遭到慘痛的破壞，第一次將橋樑炸到河中，第二次把橋墩炸去，第三次連沉沒在水中的橋基，亦整個炸去。前年二月間，浙贛路才開始淸理舊樑，以及破壞的橋基，淸除的工作，一直到去年十月底才完成。修建工作是在七月開始，新建橋墩，因爲鋼樑的遲遲未到，急煞了主持橋工的黃壽益處長。</p>
<p>橋工人員，爲了迅速達成他們的任務，受盡了經費，材料，和惡劣天候的困難，在加拿大訂購的鋼樑，原定計劃，應在去年六年交貨，但是，，加拿大在戰復的鋼產大减，迄未如期交貨，大橋工程處除了撈起一些沉沒在河底的舊樑改裝補釘，還獲得少數的聯總救濟物資—鋼樑，但是，這些鋼樑，有的尺度不够，有的又是高度不齊，所以第五孔的鋼樑，是用二十公尺的新鋼極接配，煞費苦心。</p>
<p>橋工克服困難</p>
<p>橋長五〇二點七〇公尺，計十四孔，每孔的距離凡卅五公尺，有四十一班人專打帽釘，打鑽的鋼洞，在十萬個以上，從這些打洞打針的工作上，就知道這座橋工的艱巨，他們完全憑着人力來克服缺材料，缺工具的困難。全部工程中，沒一架起重機，一段八十噸的橋樑，沒起重機由河下吊上去，就用自造的滑竿，將它吊起，新鋼樑加拿大出品的聯總物資，只有二十公尺，裝在三十五公尺的橋墩距離上，還差十五公尺，他們費盡苦心，將破壞的舊樑，用來接配，因爲工具不够，加上又是依靠人力，所以一孔鋼樑的按配，需時三個月。因此，打帽釘，鑽洞的工作，意外的忙，現在雖是通車，仍在「答」，「答」，……不斷的打帽釘。</p>
<p>大風雪中工作</p>
<p>幾次的大風雪，多厲害！主特道段艱巨工程的黃壽益處長，和他的一千餘員工，却都不斷的在工作。工程進展到最後階段，他們接運打了一個多月的夜班，有些人的頭髮，鬍鬚變得長長的了，原因是這些無名英雄，沒有空暇去整容理髮。黃壽益處長在工地接着他的太太在醫院生產的喜訊，亦沒有能抽出空暇回南昌去照料一刻。剛生下來的這位「七小姐」，取「建成」二字爲名字，就是紀念黃處長督修此一大橋的成功。</p>
<p>土霸王逞威風</p>
<p>鷹潭，是將來東南的交通總樞所在，浙贛。京贛。閩贛三路，均將在此接軌。信江岸上的這塊小高地，每寸土地，都是將來建築與經營的基地，現在已經有不少的客商，準備在那兒經營旅棧與運輸業，但這兒有一股「土霸王」的勢力，在無端無賴的阻碍這些建設的進展。</p>
<p>勝利復員，浙贛路通車，已經有了一個長長的時間，但是，浙贛路的票房，迄未建築完成，全站的員工，擠在一所矮小的平房裏，辦理他們無晝無夜的繁忙工作，辦公處所的狹小，擠得幾乎不能伸一個舒適的懶腰，每個員工，在他們工作完畢後，又要跑上相當距離的地方去膳宿，原因亦是沒法子去建築他們的辦公房屋與宿舍。「土霸王」處處阻碍他們的工作進行，例如：不准路局在鷹潭籌辦的榨油廠開工，又不准商民與各地主訂立租質契約，甚且限制新房屋建成後，二年就歸地主所有，每月每尺土地，還要付給地主一斗米的租金等等，「土霸王」說：你們要租地築屋可以，但是，不准經過我桂姓的土地挑水運石，並且要禁止承租人自由出入。</p>
<p>多少的商人，都是爲了地皮的問題無法解決，所以自浙贛路通車後，車站附近設一間運輸　　旅棧。</p>
<p>無法無天的「土霸王」的行爲，增加了外來人士對土著的僧恨，聽說有人在醞釀一次對「桂霸王」的反抗，這很可能引起流血的慘案，我們希望地方當局要重視事件的演變與不合理事實的消滅。</p>
<p>浙贛路杭州至上饒的特快車，現在因爲南饒段通車，自四日起將原有的特快車延伸至鷹潭，南昌至鷹潭間，亦自那一天起駛行交通革，開始營業。</p>
<p>「通車第一」的浙贛路，今後更應加強「安全第一」的股施，以增進鐵路與旅客的安全。（本報記者劉藻）</p>

<p>〔本報重慶十日航訊〕面積一·二一五·七八八方公里的西藏，劃分前藏後藏。前者京城爲拉薩，即是現任攝政榮增打扎的所在地，後者則爲日喀則。</p>
<p>「榮增」是西藏語師父的尊稱。打扎自從在三十六年四月，掌握西藏的實際政權後，擁護前任攝政熱振的一色拉時一喇嘛，全遭趕出西藏，彭康噶倫亦被革職，西藏的面目，已經大非昔比了。</p>
<p>在宗敎上，班禪與達賴佔有同等地位，但在政治上，一切大權全操於達賴剌嘛之手，班禪只好說是個地方官。今日西藏的政治制度可以下圖解釋。</p>
<p>四大臣係三俗一僧，機構名稱：「噶廈」，是西藏最高的行政機關。目前四大臣爲：拉魯色噶倫，葛須巴噶倫，索康汪青，然巴喇嘛。滿淸朝代，逢有四大臣出缺，必須駐藏大臣與達喇聯名向皇帝保薦現。在，達賴喇嘛一紙命令，即可解決。</p>
<p>宮中官猶如內地的侍從機關。三大寺各部門負責人，則有參政員同樣的職權。遇有重大事體，向有秘書處通知召開臨時大會或是定時大會。臨大，定大，四大臣都不能參加。會計局，軍務處，外交局，農務局，各派一代表，宮中官，三大寺，各寺院人員，必須全體與曾。討論結至，再送達賴作最後決定，至於四大臣下屬的「外交局」，我最高當局迄未批准。</p>
<p>西藏軍隊的編制，也與內地逈異。最高的指揮官爲駐昌都總管的拉魯色噶倫，這個權威機關的名稱，呌做：「馬鷄」，可說是藏軍總司令了。其次則爲戴本—如本—甲本—定本。每一個定本僅有二十五位名額，戴本則有五百人。所以西藏的一個戴本，等於內地的一位營長官銜。</p>
<p>本報記者獲悉：西藏現有軍隊的數目，帶兵官姓名，及駐紮地點，茲抄錄如左：（參看西藏現有軍隊簡表）</p>
<p>部隊番號　帶兵官　地點</p>

<p>第八營　下巴巴戴本　原駐江卡，現調昌都</p>
<p>第九營　打當德格色戴本　原駐昌都，現調江卡</p>
<p>第十營　絨噶布德戴本　江孜·日喀則</p>
<p>〔附注〕各營均有機關槍裝備。</p>
<p>現任十四輩達賴喇嘛，僅十三歲，聞須長大至十八歲，始能執掌政務。十三輩達賴喇嘛圓寂後，熱振噶倫即曾在靑海土人漢化齊姓家中覓獲十四輩轉世達賴。據本報記者探知確實消息：因爲十四輩達賴出自漢化人家，致引起熱振噶倫與榮增打扎無窮糾紛。雖然後來靑海馬元海師長將十四輩達賴送至拉薩登位，表面似吿平息，熱振終遭毒害。另外，單僅十四輩達賴的坐床費一項，也就化費了國民政府四十萬盧比</p>
<p>內地人士，自從民國八年湘籍黎丹格西，（格西爲藏文博士意，黎會任監察委員）率領「學法團」赴拉薩調查考察外，迄今仍無第二個考察團進藏。黎丹格西早已逝世，跟隨黎丹在藏八年的歐陽摯，已成了今日內地唯一精通藏務的漢人，現尙賦閑首都。至於目前在京商談的西藏商務代表國，實是民國以來首次壯舉，用意至爲重要。代表團團員索康拉多，一向率兵駐紥康·藏·交界黑河地帶，爲青·康·藏·邊境之風雲人物。其父索康扎薩，在藏素以親英聞名。長子即爲索康汪靑噶倫，女婿宇妥，前任昌都總管。另一團員邦達養璧，漢名羅紹廷，善漢語，稍識漢文。其父充本義江（已被暗害），係西藏巨商邦達昌　　創辦人，包辦西藏進出口羊毛貿易，職任後藏亞東總管，　三輩達賴喇嘛在世，確曾喧赫一時。（特派員　　醇）</p>

<p>〔本報重慶十三日航訊〕銳璞博士（Dr．C．　BertramRappe）由美來川，是在一九〇九年的一月。其時鹿依士博士（Dr．　SpencerLeuis）正在資中傳敎。他在芝加哥西北大學讀書時，‘就對中國感覺興趣。一九一〇年開始學習中文，因此使他一九一二年時出長求精中學，得到很多方便。在校卅六年中，總共培植了二萬多名高材生。今日求精中學校長楊重熙碩士，南京金陵大學校長張凌高博土，都是他當年的得意弟子。</p>
<p>這位六十七歲的瘦長博士，不甘寂寞；他已値退休年齡，勝利後僅祗回國休養了二載，又於去年十一月七日偕同夫人恩溢女士（Grace）雙雙返渝。現任職務，是求精學校的顧問，寬仁醫院的院長。他對本報記者說：「中國是我的第二故鄕，我要再爲中國服務四年」。這位博士，要到七十一歲才肯吿老返國。按照他目前的健康情形。屆時，他一定又「要再爲中國服務四年」了。</p>
<p>銳璞博士，是位虔誠的基督敎徒。抗戰期中，他主要的工作是主持下列五個救濟機關：（一）United　China　Relief，（二）Amrican　Advisory　Commettee，（三）International　Famine　Relief，（四）Commetteeon　aid　to　University　Faculties，（五）American　Red　Cross。除了第四個大學救濟委員會外，其他四個單位都是他的會計。他說：抗戰八年，美國人民援華款項共達八百五十萬美金。</p>
<p>求精中學創辦於光緒十七年，第一任校長是鹿依士博士，銳璞博士是第六任。第一任中國校長是蕭吉人，現任校長楊重熙是第八任了。求精學校，包括幼稚園。小學。中學。商專（商專已有八年歷史，即將擴大爲商學院）等部份。另外，民國廿七年間在內江還辦有一所大洲中學。不久，也將添辦一所農業專修科，俟充實設備後，再改爲農學院，一直到成立完善的大學爲止。</p>
<p>二月十四日，是博士夫婦中一生最大的光榮，重慶市長張篤倫及四川建設廳廳長何北衡，代表蔣主席頒給景星勛章二座。當記者問銳璞有何感觸，他和靄答道：</p>

<p>〔本報香港十四日電〕上海埠際足球鐵在港第三戰，今日以一比零敗於港西聯隊，上半時零比零未開紀錄。</p>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕農歷元旦，快活谷球塲，排演港滬埠際足球對抗，球迷滿座，門檣分十元，五元，三元半三種，收人兩萬六千多元。港督葛量洪親臨主持開球，賽前高奏中英兩國國歌，會塲情緒，倍見融洽。大戰結果，港隊以五比一保有勝利，上半塲二比一，也是港隊佔先。下半塲滬隊凈輸三球，賽程未見緊張，港隊以超然態勢，壓倒滬隊。</p>
<p>以爾隊的陣容來比較，滬隊就算收，也不該輸到五比一。原因是嚴。吳兩個後衛走樣，瞿永福把守中路，全不濟事，後防有了這些漏洞，自無法抵禦港隊的進擊。一條前鋒綫，兩個內鋒全不跑回後防取球，中塲優勢，全給港隊控制，尤其是到了下半塲，全陣截成二段，進退失據，但張邦綸仍有絕佳表演。五球之失，都非人力可搶救，假使邦綸能减少花巧賣弄，前途無限。港隊以張金海踢得最好，他和松生站在中塲，便完全取得中塲優勢，前鋒則以基亞能惹人呌好，兩翼　　　肖深入爭取機會，文治和宜杰又在中路呼聲響應，迫　　　挨打。從全陣表演去看，港隊快且銳，滬隊慢而亂，聯絡和錫的方法，都難與港隊並論。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港十四日電〕滬埠際足球代表隊今日戰港西聯，以零對一敗北，滬隊表演甚佳，惜球運不濟。在最後數分鐘內，滬隊有射門機會四次，均未中的，滬隊個人技術，仍以張邦綸最佳，港隊一球係右內鋒克寗漢所中，大部份意見均認此球應作越位論。</p>

<p>僅餘之一仗，甲二B申對西靑綠，甲申陶瑩石先破籃圈，番將雪鐵谷夫罰而未中，陶梅開二度，梁雄標一擲一罰，甲申以七比〇遙領。西靑沙迪谷夫，塞納谷夫二中，甲申呼停，以王介平調出陶瑩石，西靑益形不振，一任甲申蹂躪，祗見梁雄標，孫摩西，呂妙盛等，左右逢源，分數激增，十八對四後，始見雪鐵谷夫罰入二球，未幾上半時完了，甲申以廿二對七佔優。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕春節休假期滿，昨起各業均恢復交易。紅盤開出，大致吿升。市塲銀根甚爲穩定，票據交換共二九四五三張，總金額達一，四三九，九一六，〇一七，〇〇〇元。四行二局差巡八五四億元，此因各業開做紅盤交易，籌碼進出較繁之故。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕南北米市塲昨起恢復交易。在各方密切注意下，開出紅盤，米商多持觀望態度，市况平穩，成交不多。社會局原準備在市塲拋售之十萬石食米，因之未曾拋出。</p>
<p>食米　昨南市場登記到貨一五九九石，北市塲二二一九石半。白粳做價一百七十五萬，薄稻南市一百七十二萬，北市一百七十五萬。早稻南市一百七十萬，北市一百七十一萬。羊秈一百七十五萬，特高粳南市一百七十七萬，北市一百七十八萬。均未超過去歲最後收盤價格。</p>

<p>蠶豆供求兩少，提高二三萬元。菉豆北化有動，再漲十萬元。紅糧來去兩稀，步挺二三萬元。苞米青島依然暢吸，暴漲十餘萬元，收盤轉懈。</p>

<p>昨布市爲新春紅盤交易，人心大都看好，本街抵補殷切，同業亦有吃進，客路北帮略有吸納，散戶收吸亦夥，喊價以紗市狂漲，做盤拾級上升。嗣至十點後，紡建公司掛牌大量供售，行情微回，但結果十二磅龍頭等各細布，較之假前，仍狂漲十五萬至十一二萬元，其他各布亦均一致上升。</p>
<p>絲綢　人造絲昨市紅盤微昂，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤九千八百萬元，中午收盤在八百五十萬元左右，但因綢廠俱未開工，並無進胃，以致交易極謬。下午喊價八百萬元賣出。</p>
<p>廠經昨市仍未開盤，因買賣均稀，雖欲脫手，亦乏受主，或有一二有意進納，但行情苛刻，故塲外亦無交易做開。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市紅盤上揚，華强眞絲被面，開市即期做四千三百十萬元，週一期七十萬元，大誠貨大二十萬元，美亞貨較大誠大三十萬元，因交易甚稀，故收市行情並無上落。大誠格子璧縐十八萬五千元，其他各貨，廠盤大都未曾開出。</p>

<p>公債昨紛紛回跌，統丙晨開八萬二，自八萬六起，下游至七萬四結束。三六〇室五五五室買進，五〇〇室五五二室則出，五〇三室出後有進，成交仍僅一百萬光景。較前收計甲乙跌七千元，統丙降一萬一，丁種小八千元，統戊挫九千元。</p>
<p>外股昨成交寥落，中途仍易向榮。怡紗自六二萬開後，漲到六六萬　後稍回，結果較前收計怡紗英聯業廣紙版航業鋼業微升。會總　微挫，怡啤漲起半成光景，雜股尙無喊價。</p>

<p>— 丁濟萬</p>
<p>飲食節約與衛生</p>
<p>飲食之衛生，自古已知，內經上說，「食飲有節，起居有常，不妄作勞，故能形與神俱，而盡終其天年，」又語云，「病從口入」，以此疾病舍外感而外，由食飲而起者，當不在少數。</p>
<p>時値新春，習俗所趨，歲尾旣　「年夜飯」於先，年頭又須臻「春酒」于後，親朋相招，酒食徵逐，來往應酬，日無虛夕，煎炒炙煿，紛然雜陳，起初又能恣意饗餮，殆後積宴旣多，雖滿盤珍饌，羅列</p>
<p>亦感口燥乏味，謹謝不敏矣，</p>
<p>人之腸胃，容受力究屬有限，豈堪油膩　滯，多多不拒，胃臟充盈，消化乏術，其不病於傷食者幾希，</p>
<p>且也，國人習慣，不論其平日境况若何，過年時無不設法烹煮多量食物，以備新年中之大嚼，甚至積貯半月以上之精饌，若非此不足以炫耀其富有，試問擱置旣久，營養全失，或味變酸餿，吃則有碍衛生，放棄則暴殄天物，何勿酌量少備，儘可隨時添辦新鮮菜蔬，以資調劑，豈非兩宜。</p>
<p>余極力主張，在此節約時期，你來我往，大可不必，不妨提倡舉行集團聚餐一二次，旣不浪費，而於衛生，實大有裨益，質之養生家以爲何如。</p>
<h3 id="c165">婦女腹痛 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 沈仲理</p>
<p>割卵巢後之反響</p>
<p>婦女腹痛一症，息者極其普遍，曾經發表該文後，求診者紛至沓來，雖未能謂爲全然治愈，但凡經處方之後，獲致痛停經順之效果，堪爲心得之一助也。以此之故，發現中西醫術處治上之不同，而其效能之後果，反響之良惡，尤有益於患者診斷之明晰，治療之安全，用特分條述，以裨讀者間津焉。</p>
<p>『日常腹痛』痛無定期，其最顯著之症狀，爲下腹一側或兩側發生疼痛，如在大腿上面，腸骨窩裏，並有硬塊之狀，手按覺痛，甚而結成痞塊，兼見腰痠帶下，尿意頻數，亦有因打胎拿胎受傷者，西醫謂爲轍卵管炎，輸卵管疝痛，輸卵管膿腫之別，內服活血理氣，通任化瘀之劑，每獲治愈之效果。</p>
<p>『經來腹痛』經來腹痛，是謂痛經，有經前經後之異，或在經來時發作，或見於月經停止期中，其疼痛部位，在下腹正中，或左右迎動，甚則拒按，乳房發脹者，係屬肝脾氣滯，血瘀胞室所致，西醫謂爲子宮發炎，其有偏於一邊作痛者，或左或右，多屬衝任奇經不調，絡脈窒塞所致，西醫謂爲卵巢炎，兼因輸卵管炎之現象，治法略同，並宜活血理氣，重用通經之藥。</p>
<p>綜合上述二種腹痛症狀，治療上皆應着重活血停痛之劑，予每以直達子宮之藥，如紫石英，五靈脂，王不留行，橘核之品，殊有奇效也。據患者敍述，西醫有主張割去卵巢輸卵管，初步割去其一，但其效能如何，以予臨床經騐，凡診斷非確係腫瘤，雖經割除其右，則左側仍發疼痛，倘投以湯劑通瘀理氣，輒見治愈，且仍能保持原有健康，無礙生育，內服通任活絡之劑，正如西醫用通輸卵管法同，以故割除卵巢後之反饗，結果未必一定良好，堪爲事實之考證，蓋治療之目的，爲保持健康，愼重手術之施行，固無分中西醫法，惟在診斷明確，應內服湯劑，抑行手術，自未容忽視者也。</p>

<p>— 朱仁康</p>
<p>頸項中旣有淋巴腺（中醫稱少陽經），裁下復有田狀腺，淋巴腺原爲人身防　病菌之重要器官，扼其要衝，輕則消滅，重則積聚停留而爲腫核，又因病原之不同，而所起病症亦各異，宜細加辨治。</p>
<p>〔風痰〕〔猢猻痰〕風痰起於頸項部分，猢猻痰發在頦下，起時爲一個核子，大如胡桃，色白而不甚紅，感有疼痛，每在二一星期中，就能化膿，治愈尙易，</p>
<p>〔托腮癬〕〔頸癬〕〔耳根癬〕托腮癬起於腮頰兩邊，頸癬在順項中，耳根癬起在耳下，初時即起紅腫，疼痛亦劇，身發寒熱，如不消散，都在七至十日內化膿。以上各症，施治宜早，每能消散，即或出膿，治愈亦易，乃屬輕症也</p>
<p>〔瘰歷〕即爲　子頸，起時頸問有核，一顆或多顆，絕不覺痛，醫治不當，每經年累月，隔了長久，才致穿潰，流洩黃水，此症必須耐心治療，充分營養，即使已經穿　，都有治愈之望，印有治　　備索。</p>
<p>〔失榮〕患者較少，且在四十歲以上，實爲惡性淋巴腺腫或　病，亦發頸項中，扳硬如鐵，日久　爛，瘡口凹凸，但流血水，陷於不救，此爲頸部疾患中之最嚴重者。</p>
<p>〔氣頸〕俗稱爲大頸頸，實爲甲狀腺之發育太甚，分泌異常而起之腫病，頸項逐步加大，有如懸瓜，或隨喜怒消長，醫治亦少效力，但不致妨礙生命。</p>

<p>— 程國樹</p>
<p>余早年曾患肺癆三載，除應用人工氣胸術外，中西藥石，無不遍服，認爲營養療法，確有扶助體元，增進抵抗之能力，於不知不覺間，能無形消滅癆曹，即最低限度，亦能促進病灶周圍結締織之增殖，包圍癆菌，使癆菌失却生存條件，逐漸歸於消滅，今將肺癆之主要見症，及對症宇藥，列述於後，傳患斯病者，知所採擇焉。</p>
<p>「咳嗽」咳嗽爲一種反射徵象，切忌止住，當以潤肺爲主，所謂潤肺者，即安寗肺葉也，藥如沙參·麥冬·燕窩·肺露·黎靑等，有痰者加入化痰之品，如杏仁·川貝·蛤粉·遠志·結梗等。</p>
<p>「咯血」咯血與咳嗽有連帶關係，咳則肺部震動，血管易於破裂，而發生咯血，咯血後而咳仍不止者，則破裂處，不易凝固，咯血之後，熱易增高，其病勢必因此而增進，而體力亦隨之虛弱，肺癆咯血，多由咳起，色鮮艷而帶泡沫，與胃血之血色紫暗雜有食物渣滓者逈異，藥如十灰丸·參山漆·生地·阿膠·側柏葉·仙鶴草，藕節·蠶荳花露等。</p>
<p>「潮熱」肺癆咳嗽，而有潮熱，則病嚴重，若熱度高而連續不斷，爲病情重篤，耗灼津液，莫此爲甚，藥如地骨皮·靑蒿·丹皮·知母·鼈甲等。</p>
<p>「盜汗」盜汗多兼骨蒸潮熱，但骨蒸潮熟，並不因盜汗而稍减退，且盜汗不止，衰弱益甚，反能促進熱度增高，藥如癟桃干·浮小麥·穞豆衣·牡蠣等。</p>

<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>八日本刊靖文先生於「災難的歎息」一文中，講到中國的募捐，他說：「做一個中國老百姓，一年得負担多少救災性的捐款（間接或直接的），恐怕誰也統計不了。」又說：「誠然，因爲社會本是一個羣的團體，人類彼此都有互助的責任，所以募捐的方式，不一定反映着災難的意味。例如在歐美社會，除宗敎事業等類的慈善募捐外，其他學術性和文化性的募捐工作亦極普通。……不過同是募捐，人家的募捐泰半是屬於建設性的，是有希望的。一個學術團體由捐款產生了，一個大學靠捐款維持了……」</p>
<p>此論甚是。我們日常所見所聞，屬於消極性破壞性的事實在太多，屬於積極性建設性的事無法不承認少得可憐。關於這點，祗要舉目四週看看，便可知道，不必待舉例而後才可明白。記得飲冰室文集中記述一個寓言，大意是：一個做官的死了，關王要向他用刑，官稱他在陽間爲官廉潔，沒有詐取人民一文錢。閻王對他說：爲官淸廉是份內事，如今罰你，是罰你沒有好的政績，若是爲官祗要廉潔便可了事，則庭前石獅子滴水不飲，豈不是要比你廉潔得多多？</p>
<p>梁任公此言着重在爲政的效能，頗有西洋風味，已非全是中團論調。在我們常見的行狀裏，凡是做過官的，總來上二句：「爲官淸正，頗著政績。」所謂「頗著政績」者，無非就止於「爲官淸正」。我們往昔的官祗要不苛雜，不擾民，一旦卸任，治下的百姓總是對他依依不捨，十里長亭跪在地上相送。於此足見在我國做官是何等的容易，老百姓又是何等的知足。記得國內某法學權威曾對學生說：你們將來出去做官，祗要較別位知足些便是不錯，不做壞事那就很好了。這幾句話實在是由於世故太深而來，是一種無可奈何的說法。</p>
<p>中國人偏於消極，歐美人偏於積極，這點從中西文中最可看出。我本來倒沒有留意到此；去千有一位朋友在深山寺院里養病，病中閱讀中西書籍，因爲環境淸靜，心地自也澄澈，於是給他看出了一個中西文章的不同點來。他來信說：「……看看西洋雜誌文，覺得常有激勵志氣怡情悅性之作；我國的上焉者，殺氣一　，下流的女人鈔票。此國世亂之果，然戾氣所鍾，亦可爲未來團亂之源也……」此後稍稍注意四洋文章行文的作風，覺得敝友此言之不誤。西洋的文章，字行之間，總是表示樂觀，顯得有辦法，不作無病呻吟，頗有旭日當空，陽光滿地之像，讀了令人舒服。即有暴露性揭發性的文字，似也比較的心平氣和，鮮有囂張怪戾之氣，而且總是具體的指出不當之處，有條不紊地敍述病源所在，積極的提出解決問題的辦法，然後樂觀地表示問題的必可　得圓滿的解決。</p>
<p>我們時下一般的文章，空空洞洞，不着邊際的居多。至於批計性的文字，其破壞之意亦多於　，常令人起陰森恐怖不快之　。有的對於現狀作囫圇吞棗的攻擊，對牠」古腦兒的表示不滿。現狀壞在何處呢？未見具體指出。有什麼辦法去解決牠呢？又未能提出建設性的方法來。好像只是一味的表示病人患了第三四　的肺病，絕對已無救藥。有的却是採取含糊其辭的方法，或旁敵側擊，或轉灣抹角，或遠兜遠轉，或指桑駡槐。風氣所趨，文　多失去了中正和平之氣，喪失了大氣磅礴之象。這種文章除了聯供個人的發洩之外，於事又有何補。更有的是採取逃避現實或一手遮天的辦法，說到緊要關頭，文章便憂然而止，轉換話題話題而　他，所以說來說去，總覺不中嚴要，好像是書了一條龍，而不顧點睛。此種現象與當前環境成不無關係，然我所不解者，爲什麼定要寫這類言不敢由衷的文章？架性不寫，豈非可以稍稍减少讀者的反感？</p>
<p>這樣的文章，我總覺得缺乏陽光，乃是一種不健全的狀態。雖或可說迫環境，然恐也未必盡然。你但閱讀我國的詩詞，便知很少是有樂觀氣氛的，大多總是一副憂憂鬱鬱，纏綿悱惻的樣子。不是閏怨，便是傷逝，不是悲秋，便是悼亡。爲什麼不可以多多詠春　　，而一定要暮氣沉沉呢？</p>
<p>我這樣說倒也不是提倡歌功頌德，紛飾本平，祇是說唉聲歎氣，滿懷悲哀，專往壞設想想，決不是解決問題的方法。不論在文章方面，或精神方面，總須先有樂觀進取建設之心，而後才有達到建設的目的之希望。</p>

<p>— 易曰楚</p>
<p>「神」不過是「人」的想像而已。</p>
<p>「人」有很大的差別，「神」也有很大的差別。</p>
<p>西方的「神」，不過是比較美麗或强壯的「人」。他們一樣有喜怒愛樂，一樣有戀愛和戰爭，他們生活在「人」間，也會死亡。</p>
<p>東方的「神」，却是超脫於「人」的社會，他們沒有情緒的波動，生活在天堂，永遠不會死亡。</p>
<p>人類都是愛好和平的，所以除暴安良，常是神的職責，不論東方西方，都是一棵；然而，在懲惡的過程中，西方的神是憑着他的機智和勇力；東方的神，却靠「法寳」和法術了。換句話說：西方的神的能力有其限度，而東方的神却是萬能的。</p>
<p>就形貌講：西方的神，男的孔武有力，女的年靑美麗；但東方的神，却大都男的是仙風道骨兩　漸白的老丈，女的是弱不禁風的千金。</p>
<p>由「神」的不同，可以推出「人」的不同了。</p>
<h3 id="c172">本分 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 席不暖</p>
<p>民國四年，日人提二十一條要求，威脅袁世凱，全國憤切，留美學生界也組織起來，主張對日宣戰，函電交馳，非常慷慨，只有胡適之在彼時力持鎭靜，主道義的抵抗，不作無謂的犧牲，氏有一英文函致「留學界」，其重要的話有云：</p>
<p>「我以爲，在目前，學生應該鎭靜，完成我們讀書的本分，我們要爲祖國未來的建設而鑽研，祖國的將來，一定是需要我們的！」</p>
<p>究竟那時的時勢如何，我們不敢妄加判斷，胡氏在當時是飽受指摘的，甚至有許多人騰書大駡，迪選舉時都特別指明不可舉他。我們知道在羣衆的變態心理之下，有時話是很難說的，這就見出易卜生的牢騷不是無謂，「多數永遠是錯的，少數反而是對的。」這裏，我們並不否認激昂慷慨之有用，譬如五四運動及七七抗戰感情到該爆發的時候，是無論怎麼也退止不了的，古人所謂「是可忍也孰不可忍也」亦即此理。不過，我們總得承認這種現象是非常的而不是正常的，一個人的感情固然不能常久在瘋在狀態之下，一個國家一個社團也不希望時時惹起激動，須知一個波瀾的起伏，其影響往往不是一時一刻，而功過亦須數十百年，甚至數千年才能判定，—有時，簡直永遠摸不淸。</p>
<p>不只是我自已，對於大部分人，恐怕所尋求與希冀的都是「安史」罷？老子之小國寡君，是應着戰國時代的爭城爭地而發的，墨子的兼愛非攻，是應着殺人盈野而發的。這都是對於病態的診治，所以說話難免有過當之處；殆即矯枉者必過其正耳。儒家一面提出了仁義等信條，一面又說了「素其位而行」，「不在其位，不謀其政」云云，這裏面的意思不是袖手旁觀，不負職責，乃正是表現了一個國民自有其本分，不可妄動，亦不可不動之意。細想起來，人類社會雖然號稱有組織，有秋序，然而旣把關係建設在「君臨」「臣屬」之上，那維繫的方式就很成問題，不但「諸侯之門，仁義在焉」而且誰不看了皇帝眼紅呢？流氓成了皇帝，叔孫通帶着一羣士大夫演習朝儀，這未免是悲劇，然而推想流氓之所以成了皇帝，其實乃是由於士大夫或者一般人未能克盡厥職之所致。假使社會的分工是非常明確，而權利義務都公平合理的話，戰爭又由何而起，流血更是不必需。唯此所云分工與權利義務，就是永遠弄不淸的一樁事，而又不能不責之有了知識的人糊塗者也。</p>
<p>常常有人致慨於中國文盲之多，可是有的人諷刺的說：「還是少幾個讀書人吧，你看，做壞事的都是這般傢伙！不念書的老百姓，百分之百是道地好人。」這倒使我們不能不面紅耳赤起來了，貪汚的，枉法的，賣國的，那一個是老百姓的事？可是流毒所及，都是老百姓付出這筆債務，所以老百姓在那裏不平，爲什麼知識分子會這樣糟，你當然可以簡單明白的吿訴我：「生活問題」，其實這又不盡然，不唯有些貪汚者是家資巨「億」，而且即在從前生活頂易維持之時，刮地皮的亦復不少。依我的意思這只是一個「不安分」的心理在作祟，第一是對於生活不安分，沒有別人那樣生產，而想享受別人那樣消費，所以我們雖然連鋼軌都鑄不出來，可是一九四八年的汽車並不少，社會上把這種享受稱之爲有風頭，把金錢的高度來衡量人格，風氣怎麼會好得起來？其次是對於職守的不安分，這又分爲兩種，一種是純職守的，一種是服務道德的，委任官羨忌薦任，薦任埀涎特簡，其所慕者，無非是可以多錢多勢，並不是盡更大的職責；至於道德方面，大約不必我來說起，諸公自能心領神會。古人本以各安生理爲最低圖治之條件，如今則是人人均不安生，現實生活與心理，俱是一個妄字，受罪也受得妄，享受更是豈有此理，可是迂闊的提出各盡所能的守本分論，終必被革命家嗤之以鼻，此眞無可如何者矣！</p>
<h3 id="c173">中西樂的橋梁 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>我以爲中央廣播樂團的成就並不是一般所認爲的「發揚國粹」，而是它做了「中西音樂的橋樑」。簡明的說，便是讓只能欣賞中樂的聽衆，逐漸了解西樂。</p>
<p>大多數中國人都曾咒駡過西樂，前工部局樂隊（即今之市府交響樂團）初在上海演奏時，華人指爲「黃蜂呌」，他們的聽覺大都會輕易地抹煞了西樂中「流動建築」的立體交織美—現代音樂藝術的最高境界，爲中樂所無。</p>
<p>現在，廣播樂團却用一個週當的方法來說服這般厭惡現代音樂的人們。這方法便是：參照西洋管弦樂隊的形式。用中樂器組成中樂的Orchestra，例如：弦的部份包括高音二胡，中音二胡及低音二胡，恰恰相當於西樂隊中的小提琴，中提琴及大提琴；曲子方面，則以西洋的交響樂形式爲形式；先有主題，而後加以發展，全曲分四個樂章，不過樂曲的精神（味兒）仍爲東方色彩。例如「賣糖人」一曲（六日在上海金城戲院演奏），先以短笛奏出主題，而後由其他樂器策應，變化，描寫一童話題材的賣糖者故事，恰似西樂中的「描寫音樂」。又如「靈山梵音」一曲，亦完全模仿交響樂的曲式，以慢板，中板，快板，急速板等的先後進行，「和聲」，「對位」的使用，以及樂語妙用，來暗示佛的全能，這正是西樂中的「標題音樂」。</p>
<p>此外，指揮制度及五綫記譜法以及其他演奏技巧的採用，都來自西樂，在外表上觀，廣播樂團即是化身的西洋的交響樂團，不過樂器數目較少，樂器本身仍爲「中國籍」而音樂內容爲中國色彩而已。</p>
<p>但是，聽衆決不會認爲這是西樂，而且覺得這比較複雜的中樂，確比原有的中樂更有情趣，因此他們感覺到到原有中樂的原始與落後，所謂「古代雅樂」，只能偶而滿足「懷古」的情緒，其本身究是反進步的。</p>
<p>這種「改良國樂」的作用，在介紹並說明西樂的價値。聽衆在接受這種國樂後，會自然地逐漸了解現代音樂的立體美，不再如從前之武斷了。從而我們會普遍地接受以現代進步的樂器，進步的方法，來表現我們的民族音樂，而不一定以樂器論國籍了。</p>
<p>在廣播樂團所採用的十一孔新笛（中研院創製）一事中，又吿訴我們二事：第一，此新笛半音階均全，變調自由，所表現的情調齊備，可用於合奏，足證原有六孔笛之不完備不合理，無須再加强辯了。第二，此笛雖已與洋笛相類，但無開閉器，演奏不便利；足證中樂器改良到極點，充其量不過與西樂相等。其實在所有的改良中樂器中，都有這個情形，這是因爲這些原始的樂器大都是現代樂器的遠祖之故，樂器只有進步與否之差別，並無國籍之分。</p>
<p>中國新音樂的前途，很明白的是接受西樂的方法與器具，而保留固有的民族性格。中央廣播樂團正以中樂的器具來敎育人們了解西樂的方法與價値，這工作是値得讚頌的。</p>

<p>— 君左</p>
<p>蘭州的雙城門外可以說是平民的唯一娛樂場所，那裏有各種說書塲和各種地方劇院，其中有一家唱河南戲的豫劇院，呌做中州戲院，生意特別地好</p>
<p>去年秋天，我　聽　　次河南戲。一座蘆蓆篷低覆的劇塲和滿台呌化子式的行頭，我眞有點坐不住了，那裏料到忍耐到最後一齣戲，竟似沙漠裏突然冒出一朶鮮花。有一個女戲子，雖然不見得怎樣漂亮，而她的唱白和做功眞正到了爐火純靑的地步。這個女伶名呌宋淑雲，原來是豫劇的紅伶。</p>
<p>道一個河南班子賣座雖盛，仍是虧本，不容易支持。蘭州文化界的朋友（連我在內），一來知道近年有人正在從事改良豫劇運動，二來覺得豫劇中還　些人才，特別是女性演員，上海可以把越劇革新，蘭州爲什麼不可以改進豫劇？在幾次文化會報上交換意見的結果，決定向這方面試辦一下。恰巧西北行轅新聞處有這個意思，新聞處有一支健全的話劇隊伍，不妨再控制一個地方劇集團，作穴傳民族文化的利器。時機漸漸地醖釀成熟了。</p>
<p>在我離開了蘭州兩個多月重新回到這座冰雪的古城！再度踏進豫劇院的時候，很欣慰地，這個戲院已在行轅新聞處個導之下積極地開展工作，換了一個名字，呌做新光豫劇院了。雖然還是那座蘆蓆篷，但已加　飾，戲院裏的秩序比從前好，呌化子的行頭不再見，而紅伶身上炫耀着嶄新的衣裝，一般演員也整齊得多。河南戲或者說中州戲在今日之蘭州已紅得發紫，壓倒這裏的一切地方劇（秦腔，晋腔，評劇）和京戲，每天只演夜塲一塲，而塲塲客滿。</p>
<p>蘭州社會上，這幾個月無論達官富貴，文人雅士，販夫走卒，太太小姐，幾乎人人都把豫劇作談話的絕妙題材，尤其是把豫劇兩大坤伶——宋淑雲和王景雲——捧上天去，無形地分為宋黨王黨，幾家報紙更煊染得厲害，熱鬧非，因之一般人對於豫劇的興趣更加提高，戲院的大門被擠破了幾次。</p>
<p>這樣，湧起了一股藝術批判的狂潮，如何把豫劇改革而成爲現代化的戲劇，已成爲今日蘭州愛好戲劇者的主題了。在上海，地方劇的越劇走紅運，似乎沒有人齒及什麼豫劇吧？但是我敢斷言；這一種中原藝術典型的豫劇，它的本身是確有價値的，只要它能配合得上時代的需要，在本身上力求進步，再加上有幾個特出的人才，我敢斷言：豫劇的前述一定還要邁過越劇以上的。</p>
<p>豫劇旣是我國地方劇之一種，它當然代表着地方色彩，所謂地方色彩，就是反映該地城的人情與一般人民生活的欲求。所以豫劇之充滿河南情調却正是它的特徵，這種特徵在某種　度上不但不應該把它毀滅，而且應該發揚。但是，一個地方的人情與生活的欲求是隨時代變遷而轉移的，所以一種戲劇不但應該保持它的地方特殊性，還應該保持它的時代進步性。豫劇又何能例外？</p>
<p>改革豫劇的着重點似乎應該把握以上兩個原則吧。讓我來鄭重介紹現代河南一位有學識有熱情和毅力的戲劇改革家樊粹庭先生，他所編著與親自導演的若干新豫劇，一反以前各舊地方劇窠臼，而强烈地表現了下列諸特點：</p>
<p>（一）是富有民族革命意識，提倡熱烈的愛國情緒，如「克敵榮歸」，「巾幗使」，「滌恥血」，「葉含嫣」諸劇。</p>
<p>。是富有反封建反貪汚的民主革命色彩，如「伉儷箭」，「霄壞恨」諸劇。</p>
<p>（三）是富有反舊禮敎並有積極提高女子在社會地位之主觀的欲求，如「凌雲志」，「三拂袖」，「巾幗使」諸劇。</p>
<p>（四）是主張女性第一，愛情至上，如「女貞花」，「葉含嫣」諸劇。</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. Provides Two Batches of Relief Supplies; All to Arrive in China by Early June; Rumor of Loan to China to Be Executed Through Export of Goods <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] The U.S. State Department announced today that of the $18 million in relief funds for China, approved by Congress last December after the end of UNRRA, $13 million has now been designated for purchasing rice. These two allocations bring the total U.S. relief to China after UNRRA's end to $45.7 million. The first allocation of $27.7 million was approved last July. According to officials at the State Department, the materials under the above two plans are scheduled to arrive in China around June 1st, so that distribution in five major coastal cities of China can be completed before the June 30th expiration date of the plan. The allocation of the $18 million is as follows: $13.087 million to purchase 47,752 tons of rice, representing 84% of the total rice allocated to China by the U.S. in the first six months of this year; $2.282 million to purchase 18,600 tons of American wheat, representing the U.S. wheat allocation to China for February and March; $1 million for medical supplies; $431,000 for coarse grains and corn seeds; and $100,000 for pesticides. Another $1 million is set aside for purchasing petroleum and diesel fuel needed for transporting relief supplies within China. The State Department also disclosed that the 50,000 tons of wheat allocated to China under the first plan has already been shipped in batches, with some already arriving in China. All 43,500 tons of rice are scheduled to be shipped completely by early March, with 9,000 tons already shipped and 20,000 tons scheduled for February. Other materials under the second plan will be shipped immediately. 2,000 tons of mixed grain seeds will be distributed to farmers in drought and flood areas to increase food production. U.S. officials explained that the $1 million for medical supplies is not related to the medical supplies under the tenth plan. This $1 million is to supplement the first plan, and any remaining funds may be used to purchase rice. The above officials, when referring to recent external accusations of the State Department delaying the transportation of the first plan, stated that the transportation plan and its dates were fully agreed upon after consultation between the Chinese government and the U.S. relief goods distribution delegation stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] According to American Business Weekly, the $570 million that the U.S. intends to lend to China will follow commercial channels. The method is for private exporters to export goods to the U.S., and then private importers to import goods from the U.S. to China. The list of goods will be handed over to the Chinese government, which will distribute these materials. If this is true, it proves that the pressure exerted by American foreign trade merchants to participate in the implementation of the aid to China plan has yielded results. The newspaper also stated that Japan may supply railway equipment worth $10 million to the Canton-Hankow Railway.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The Washington News discussed the State Department's aid to China plan today, stating that the amount of $570 million does not resemble a long-term plan. Most advocates of aid to China believe that a three-year period is the minimum for any active plan. Regardless of the amount or the duration, China is extremely fragile and requires the greatest skill in allocating and controlling aid in order to be effective. Too much of the U.S. aid that China has received since the victory has been wasted. Chairman Chiang should welcome effective control, but the goal must be to strengthen, not weaken, the Chinese government. The method and amount of aid are equally important. The State Department's plan makes no mention of military aid, which is the most glaring omission. It must be understood that Chairman Chiang's troops need American arms and materials, especially American army and air force instructors.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has begun drafting the international trade plan for the 37th year (1948). The content will include four parts: A. Increase exports to compete for foreign markets. B. Improve imports to make full use of foreign exchange for developing China's economy. C. Protect domestic industry. D. Expand the scope of commodity inspection to make our country's goods suitable for foreign market needs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The list of imports and exports for trade with Japan for the 37th year (1948) was approved at the 12th regular meeting of the Trade with Japan Steering Committee on the afternoon of the 14th.

<h3 id="e3">Prospects for Private Trade Between China and Japan Appear Bleak; Japan Firmly Demands Exchange of Coal and Iron <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese government's firm demand to exchange iron ore and coking coal from our country has made it impossible for Chinese businessmen who came to Japan to conclude large trade contracts. Since arriving in Japan three weeks ago, Chinese businessmen have not yet signed any contracts with Japanese commercial firms. Representatives feel that the prospects for private trade between the two countries are bleak. It is reported that although they are currently continuing negotiations with the Japanese Board of Trade and SCAP, even if any contracts are signed, they will not be large-scale. The Japanese government plans to export to China goods that China needs, such as machinery, textiles, and sundries, but does not want to trade with Chinese merchants who cannot supply items necessary for Japanese industry. Iron ore and coking coal are the only items that Japan insists on in exchange for its exports, but these two items are currently strictly controlled by the Chinese government. The items that Chinese merchants can supply, such as ramie and lacquer, are considered non-essential by SCAP and the Japanese Board of Trade. Although the Board of Trade may approve a small number of contracts for these non-essential items, Chinese merchants believe that the total value of transactions this year will be less than one million U.S. dollars. According to confidential documents obtained by reporters from the Japanese government, Japan plans to export machinery and sundries worth 10 million U.S. dollars annually to central and southern China, in addition to chemical products and agricultural products. These include 300 textile machines, 1,000 motors, 19,000 horsepower diesel engines, 3.6 million pounds of rayon, 5,000 tons of newspaper, 3,000 sewing machines, and 5 million blankets.</p>
<h3 id="e4">U.S. Export License Policy; Relevant Chinese Authorities Intensifying Study <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has been paying close attention to the U.S. announcement of a new export license policy, with an initial list of over 400 types of restricted export items. This list of restricted export items has been sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs by Liu Dajun, the commercial counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently studying it. On the morning of the 13th, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Tong Jiling, invited representatives from relevant ministries and commissions to hold the first consultation to discuss the impact of the U.S.'s implementation of the new export license policy on China's international trade and to discuss countermeasures. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Export-Import Management Committee, the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the China Trust Bureau participated. The meeting discussed the limit on the number of the U.S. restriction of export items and the amount of materials that our country needed to import, as well as the amount of foreign exchange that could be used to import materials. However, it was only a preliminary exchange of views, and no conclusions were reached. Another meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss appropriate measures.</p>
<h3 id="e5">China Reduces Import Quotas; Reaction from U.S. Exporters <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] The initial reaction of local exporters to China's recent measures to reduce import quotas is that China is clearly trying to preserve its U.S. dollar reserves. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Commerce here said that Nanjing's move to reduce import quotas clearly aims to limit U.S. exports to China. Hunter, the general manager of Williford Company, said that given the burden on China's foreign exchange reserves, the move to reduce import quotas is not surprising, and this move indicates that effective assistance should be given immediately to this war-torn country. The local Chamber of Commerce said that if the reduced import quotas do not include American goods that have not yet been shipped to China, then the impact on exports to China is still small. Some trade figures believe that the Nanjing statement is very timely and may accelerate the passage of the aid to China plan by Congress. At the same time, many exporters are waiting to learn the details of the goods restricted by China's new import rules.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The grain rationing conference for the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has been rescheduled to begin on the 16th. The main topics of discussion will be approximately: (A) Discussion of sales prices. It is reported that the Ministry of Food only intends to set prices 5% lower than market prices.

<h3 id="e10">Special Relief Donation Collection; Decided to Adopt Mandatory Measures; List of Wealthy People Being Carefully Considered <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The discussion on the quotas for the collection of special relief donations in various regions and the list of wealthy people was raised at the design committee of the Special Relief Donation Supervision Committee on the 14th, but no concrete conclusions were reached. A definite decision will be made after the Supervision Committee approves it. Today's meeting was chaired by Wang Fuzhou, the chairman of the committee, and representatives from the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other relevant ministries attended. In terms of quotas, a principle has been roughly decided, that is, the Shanghai area should collect half of the total target of 10 trillion yuan, or 5 trillion yuan. The second largest area is Guangzhou, because Guangzhou includes Hong Kong and Macau, it may reach 1.2 trillion yuan. The Nanjing area is quite difficult to determine, because if Nanjing is only considered from a local perspective, its proportion should not be too large. However, there are quite a few military and political figures who are in office or retired in Nanjing and are among the wealthy. Therefore, some people have suggested that the collection in the Nanjing area should be politically enforced to achieve the collection goal, so the proportion of the Nanjing area should be slightly larger. This discussion did not reach a conclusion at today's meeting. Second, mandatory measures will be adopted to achieve the collection goal. The list is still under careful consideration by the various members, and some members have not yet been selected. However, well-known wealthy people have generally been proposed. As for whether the donations must be paid in cash, it has been decided at the meeting that they can be replaced with in-kind goods, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has been designated to draft specific measures. Second, the meeting also allocated current work, such as the collection work for overseas Chinese, which was assigned to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for research; the Ministry of Interior is responsible for the reward measures for donations; and the Executive Yuan's Information Office is responsible for publicity and promotion. Also approved was the organizational charter and list of members of the committee. This committee is an agency responsible for drafting measures, and it is scheduled to meet once every two weeks, but in the early stages of its establishment, it will be held once a week.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Gao Youxin, an Air Force lieutenant colonel and flying ace who was renowned for his achievements during the War of Resistance, was crushed to death by a train on the railroad tracks east of Wulaoqiao in Nanjing at 3 p.m. on the 13th. Gao suffered from mental disorder, which began in the 35th year (1946). At that time, he flew to the Northeast with Du Yuming to take over the region. One night, while discussing a problem with several colleagues, he became overly excited and unfortunately fell from a high building, sustaining serious injuries. His brain nerves were shaken too much, and he became confused. He was sent to the United States for treatment by the Air Force Headquarters, but after more than half a year, he did not recover completely and returned to the country. After returning to the country, he was treated at the Central Hospital. On the 13th, he was just discharged from the Central Hospital and for some reason, he lay down on the railroad tracks and was crushed to death by a train. Both feet were crushed, and his head was severely injured, and he died on the spot. Gao was the deputy commander of the 14th Squadron of the Air Force, a graduate of the 8th class of the Aviation School, and only 37 years old. During the War of Resistance, he destroyed more than 100 enemy planes and made outstanding achievements 275 times, breaking the highest record in the Air Force's combat achievements. He was awarded as many as 15 medals, including one Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. He was known as the second Gao Zhihang in our country's Air Force and was highly valued by Zhou Zhirou. After Gao was crushed to death, Zhou Zhirou, the commander-in-chief of the Air Force, was deeply saddened when he heard the news. He immediately sent Fan Guanghua, the head of the General Affairs Department, to send his body to the China Funeral Home and notify his family to arrange the funeral. On the morning of the 14th, Gao's body was moved to the China Funeral Home. His wife, Ms. He, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, embraced the body, and cried bitterly, fainting several times. When Gao was in the Central Hospital, his wife, Ms. He, took care of him every day. Ms. He had recently gone to Shanghai for business, and unexpectedly, this unfortunate tragedy occurred just after she returned from Shanghai, so her grief was even greater.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Fourteenth Dispatch] According to information from the Guangdong Police Security Department: Treacherous bandits occupying the East River area of Guangdong Province have become increasingly rampant in protecting smuggling.

The main items are foreign yarn, foreign oil, and cigarettes, exceeding 20,000 dan per day, even more than during the occupied period.

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] As the war in the Northeast is in full swing, people from the Northeast living in Beijing, such as Mo Dehui, Yu Bin, and Wang Depu, have been appealing to relevant parties for increased troops. After visiting President Zhang Qun on the 13th, they continued to visit Chief of Staff Chen Cheng on the 14th to present their opinions. It is learned from relevant parties that they have the following views on the current situation in the Northeast: First, they have confidence in Chen Cheng as the director. In the past, with Chen sitting in town and coordinating the overall situation of military and administration, the people of the Northeast were able to feel psychologically stable. Now that Chen has returned to the capital to recuperate, people in the Northeast cannot help but have national concerns about personnel matters; Second, they are worried about the actions of the National Army, that is, Fan Hanjie's corps tightly guarding Qinhuangdao and Huludao, as if the government is preparing to withdraw from the Northeast, so they have to appeal to the authorities at this juncture to send heavy troops to reinforce the Northeast. However, authoritative sources believe that the central government's policies and determination will definitely not be as the above two points state, and the central government will definitely not abandon the Northeast rashly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang Fourteenth Dispatch] According to those who escaped from Liaoyang: Liaoyang is silent after the robbery.

<h3 id="e30">Looking at the Cabinet Tides in Japan <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Katayama Cabinet in Japan, which has been in power for more than eight months, has finally officially announced its collapse. Anyone who pays a little attention to Japanese issues generally believes that the collapse of the Katayama Cabinet was expected. Around February each year is originally Japan's "political season." When Tetsu Katayama, as the leader of the Socialist Party, stepped onto the political stage, he was inherently conservative. Therefore, he could not unify the will of the Socialist Party internally, and it was obvious that he could not survive this political season. Looking at his political achievements over eight months and ten days in office, it can be said that they were extremely mediocre and unproductive. His eventual forced resignation can also be said to have been predetermined.</p>
<p>When we study the reasons for this, the most fundamental reason is that the ruling Socialist Party is not a major party with a majority of seats in the Diet. Although the Socialist Party won the support of voters in the general election last April and nominally became the largest party in Japan, the number of seats it won did not exceed half. Until the day the Katayama Cabinet resigned, the distribution of power among the parties in the Japanese House of Representatives was still as follows: Socialist Party 123 seats, Liberal Party 119 seats, Democratic Party 102 seats, National Cooperative Party 32 seats, Comrades Association 22 seats, All Farmers Group 16 seats, First Member Club 15 seats, Farmers Party 7 seats, Communist Party 4 seats, Independents 2 seats, Vacancies 20 seats. Since Katayama could not organize a pure Socialist Party cabinet, he had to win over the other three major parties to form a four-party coalition cabinet, and therefore had to make considerable concessions in policy. At the same time, the formation of the coalition cabinet was not thorough enough. On the one hand, Tetsu Katayama refused to allow the left wing of the Socialist Party to join the cabinet, and on the other hand, the leader of the Liberal Party, Kotada, refused to join the cabinet, preferring to be the largest party in opposition. Therefore, the Katayama Cabinet was inherently mediocre and incompetent, and the crisis of internal division had long been lurking. In the past eight months, it has not only been frequently attacked by the opposition Liberal Party, but also the parties in power have been nominally united and often disagreed, so its political foundation has been shaky every day. When the second session of the Diet reconvened on the 10th of this month and the "political season" began, the Katayama Cabinet tried its best to struggle, but Jun Ashida, the leader of the Democratic Party, finally disagreed with Katayama and agreed to the resignation of the cabinet, so the Katayama Cabinet had to resort to a general resignation. As Katayama stated in his statement: "The general resignation of the cabinet today is the inevitable result of the coalition cabinet. I can be proud that I have never made a single mistake in the development of democratic politics in Japan; especially by trying to avoid dissolving the House of Representatives and causing the cabinet to resign en masse, it is the result of a fair judgment of the domestic and foreign political situation. As for the future cabinet, in the current situation without a majority party, I think it is more appropriate to organize a coalition cabinet."</p>
<p>But after the Katayama Cabinet resigned en masse, who will succeed in forming the cabinet? This question should be noted by people from all countries. As of this writing, we dare not make a hasty judgment. After learning of the cabinet's en masse resignation, Speaker of the House of Representatives Matsuoka visited Jun Ashida of the Democratic Party, Katayama of the Socialist Party, and Miki of the Cooperative Party respectively to exchange views on forming a cabinet. The three party leaders unanimously agreed to convene a four-party leaders meeting. When Matsutou visited Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party, Yoshida believed that since the Liberal Party is the largest party in opposition, it should naturally succeed in forming a cabinet and governing; even if a four-party coalition cabinet is formed, the Liberal Party should obtain the position of prime minister. According to "constitutional rules," Yoshida should be nominated as the next prime minister; there are also expressions of support in the House of Councillors. However, looking around at the situation, it does not seem to be the time for Yoshida's comeback. First, the conservative new party movement led by Yoshida has not yet matured, and it is too early to come out to form a cabinet at this time. Second, MacArthur has not only expressed opposition to the new party movement, but has also sometimes taken repressive measures. The representative of the Allied Headquarters will make a statement on the successor candidate: "If the Katayama Cabinet resigns, when there is no majority party in Japan that can succeed in forming a cabinet, the only way is for the parties to negotiate a coalition cabinet in the Diet; if the agreement fails, then the only way is to dissolve the Diet to decide which majority party in the next Diet will organize a new cabinet. In my personal opinion, I do not quite agree with the new party movement that is currently being proposed." In today's Japan, the Allied Headquarters' implication is nothing less than a powerful instruction. No matter how good Yoshida is at dealing with it, he will not be able to overcome this major obstacle. Therefore, based on the current situation, everyone believes that the possibility of Jun Ashida of the Democratic Party becoming the prime minister is the greatest.</p>
<p>Dong Tian also advocates that the Socialist Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Party, and Cooperative Party should jointly organize a four-party coalition cabinet. The Democratic Party's executive committee decided on the 12th to reject the tolerance policy towards the left wing of the Socialist Party and strive to seek a compromise with the Liberal Party; moreover, the current political situation is also conducive to Ashida. MacArthur has already stated: "The solution to Japan's political problems will be decided by the Japanese people." Inadvertently, he has expressed his intention to support Ashida's cabinet formation. But we know that the Democratic Party's position in the House of Representatives is not only inferior to the Socialist Party, but also not as good as the Liberal Party. If Ashida attempts to form a four-party coalition cabinet but cannot obtain the cooperation and support of the Liberal Party, then the political foundation for his cabinet formation will be even weaker and more unstable than the Katayama Cabinet. Even if a cabinet is reluctantly formed, it will have no future. The current political situation in Japan is extremely chaotic, not only creating a situation of many small parties, but also the ideological differences between the parties are extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>The difficult birth of the Japanese cabinet has not only caused the Allied Headquarters to feel deeply anxious, but has also warned Japanese political parties not to use large parties to oppress small parties. Moreover, Katayama himself said that the candidate for the next prime minister is "unknown." Therefore, looking forward to the cabinet tides in Japan, it is just beginning. Yoshida and Ashida are competing, and their strengths are evenly matched, so there is a possibility of both sides being injured. In the end, Katayama may reorganize the coalition cabinet again. This can be seen from the Socialist Party's efforts to unify the left and right wings in recent days. Because the fundamental reason for the Katayama Cabinet's general resignation lies in the internal split of the Socialist Party. Therefore, if the split phenomenon can be eliminated, the three-party coalition cabinet centered on the Socialist Party will naturally still have the possibility of a resurgence.</p>
<h3 id="e31">CCP Radio Broadcast Demands US Troops Withdraw, Otherwise No Preferential Treatment for Captured US Soldiers <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press San Francisco Thirteenth Dispatch] The CCP radio broadcast on the thirteenth is generally regarded as nothing more than a final notice demanding the US Navy and Marine Corps to leave China. The CCP broadcast also demanded that the United States guarantee that it would no longer provide assistance to the National Government as an exchange condition for lenient treatment of the four US Marines captured by the Communist Party since Christmas last year. They disappeared on Christmas Day while hunting outside Qingdao, the headquarters of the US Navy in the Western Pacific. The burned-out jeep was found 33 miles north of Qingdao near Laiyang City. According to the broadcast received by the Associated Press, the capture of the four US Marines was due to their assistance to the National Army in combat. It continued that the headquarters of the "Jiaodong People's Liberation Army" had lodged a strong protest with the US Navy in China, demanding an apology and a guarantee that there would be no such actions in the future. Otherwise, the US Navy and the US government should bear full responsibility for the consequences of these actions. If the US Navy authorities accept this legitimate request, the "Liberation Army" will treat the captured US Marines leniently in the spirit of friendship between the Chinese and American people. The broadcast listed numerous accidents caused by the US actively providing military assistance to the Chinese government and then said: "To avoid the recurrence of such accidents, the US armed forces and military personnel should immediately withdraw from China."</p>
<p>The CCP radio said that the five Marines were captured near Laiyang while assisting the National Army in combat. One of them, named Blaydon, was wounded in combat and died in a field hospital.</p>
<p>However, when they disappeared, the US Navy Headquarters in China claimed that the four Marines were actually out hunting. They were carrying hunting rifles, not rifles as claimed by the Communist Party, and the fifth person participated privately without permission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] According to a broadcast received here this morning from the Communist bandits, five US soldiers of the US Marine Corps in Qingdao who disappeared on November 2 last year, one of them has been killed, and the other four are still prisoners of the Communist bandits in Shandong. The killed person was Private Blaydon, and the other four were Corporal Taulard, Private First Class Dixon, Private Hart, and Private First Class Jabody Stelia. Mailby, the head of the US Embassy's press office, told reporters this morning: The claim in the broadcast that the five people were captured last year 100 li [Chinese mile] from their headquarters because they actively helped the National Army in combat is absolutely not true. The five people were arrested while hunting. The broadcast continued that the CCP had lodged a very strong protest with the US Navy authorities in China, demanding that the latter apologize and guarantee that there would be no similar situations in the future. The protest also stated that if the US Navy authorities accept this request, the CCP will give the captured four US soldiers lenient treatment. During his meeting with reporters, Mr. Mai also said that he had not heard of any protests to the US Navy authorities in China. What he heard this time was the first new information about them since the five people disappeared.</p>

<p>Communist Bandits Wantonly Destroy Religion, Belief in Church Struggle Strengthens</p>
<p>[Our City News] The Communist bandits wantonly destroy religion in their occupied areas, which has been confirmed by Cardinal Tian Gengxin, who has just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping. Tian told reporters: There are now more than 2,000 Catholics in Beiping who have escaped from various Communist bandit-occupied areas. Many of them have been arrested and detained by the Communist bandits. Although missionary work in the Communist area of North China is extremely difficult, the Church has never considered a plan to withdraw. Because the Catholic Church has undergone full or partial suffering and tempering in various countries around the world for more than 1,000 years, the difficult history has strengthened our belief in struggling against evil forces. Tian came to Shanghai to participate in the National Catholic Education Conference. He said: He plans to propose to the conference that each of the 130 dioceses in the country should subsidize two poor college students to study abroad, and to establish a general organization to promote educational work. The dioceses should fully cooperate to achieve results more easily.</p>

<p>Executive Yuan and Examination Yuan Reiterate Previous Order</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan have jointly issued an order to the provincial governments, reiterating that county magistrates who have passed the examination and those selected by the Central Government should be given priority for appointment according to the law. The order reads as follows: "It has been previously ordered on December 5, 1945, that personnel who have passed the county magistrate examination according to law in various provinces, as well as county magistrates selected by the Central Government, should be given priority for appointment according to law. However, it has been reported that many provincial governments are still delaying the appointment of the aforementioned personnel, or even if they have been appointed, they are arbitrarily transferred or dismissed without any fault on their part, which is a great loss to the intention of careful selection and recruitment. This order is now reiterated. Hereafter, when provincial governments fill county magistrate positions - except for the county magistrate positions in pacification areas, which may be temporarily filled by personnel selected by the provincial government based on the actual situation of each county to meet practical needs; the remaining county magistrate positions in non-pacification areas (this section applies to the provinces of Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Rehe) - must strictly adhere to Article 10 of the Civil Service Appointment Law, Article 1 of the County Magistrate Appointment Law, and Article 12 of the Regulations for the Selection of County Magistrates from Qualified Candidates in Higher Examinations, and give priority to appointing county magistrates who have passed the examination and those who have been selected in turn. Only when the aforementioned two categories of personnel and the qualified county magistrates selected by the Central Government and distributed by the Ministry of Interior are insufficient for appointment may other qualified personnel be appointed. Those who have already been appointed and are currently in office should be legally protected. If other personnel are arbitrarily appointed, the Ministry of Personnel will be held responsible for not reviewing the appointment, and will jointly order the replacement of those personnel with the Ministry of Interior, and will also be held accountable based on the severity of the situation."</p>

Furthermore, in order to prevent spring famine and replenish food reserves, the Provincial Government has decided to request the Central Government to open ordinary food loans, suggesting that the Central Government purchase and store 20,000 shi (unit) of rice in each of the four counties of Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, requiring approximately 120 billion, to be approved and loaned by the Central Government and handled by the county governments for storage and purchase.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Jinan Flour Prices Rise Sharply; Food Prospects Cause Concern <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 14th] The price of top-grade flour here has broken the million mark per bag. The reporter specifically interviewed Director Li Disheng of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, who stated that based on the current grain sources and prices in various places, the spring famine in the city is expected to be severe. The source of grain is currently limited to Zhangdian and Tai'an. The areas of Kezhou and Jining have not yet opened for free trading. It is expected that flour prices will continue to rise. The municipal government is currently unable to open up grain sources. The only effective way to control grain prices is to forward a request to the Central Government for the transportation of southern grain to the north, emulating the request of Tianjin and Beijing for subsidies on flour. The banditry in Shandong has not yet been suppressed, and Jinan is crowded with refugees. If effective countermeasures are not taken quickly, the future is a cause for concern.</p>

<h3 id="e63">U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves in Principle the Four-Year Aid to Europe Recovery Plan; Stipulates Initial 12-Month Expenditure of $5.3 Billion; Submission to Senate Next Month Will Spark Heated Debate <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed the Four-Year Aid to Europe Act by a vote of 13 to 0, stipulating an initial 12-month expenditure of $5.3 billion. President Truman had requested an initial 15-month expenditure of $6.8 billion. Committee Chairman Vandenberg said that the reduction was due to a "change in schedule" rather than a decrease in the net amount. Shortening the term to 15 months allows the new Congress (meaning the new Congress after the November elections) to have the opportunity to conduct a realistic review of the implementation of the aid to Europe plan and then vote on the necessary additional funding. The original text of the bill still has a few minor details that need to be sorted out before it can be finalized. However, today's decision has resolved the last major issue, and it is expected to be submitted to the Senate for discussion within the next week. Republican Senator Taft and other members of the party have called for drastic cuts, with Taft advocating a $2 billion reduction. Vandenberg also said that the bill stipulates that a construction syndicate will advance $1 billion as start-up capital, so that funds will not be lacking while Congress discusses individual appropriation bills. The effective period is until the end of June 1952, which is what the government requested. As for transportation, the bill stipulates a compromise, allowing countries participating in the aid to Europe plan to lease 300 U.S. ships. The government had requested the sale of 200 ships and the lease of 300 ships, which was opposed by shipping associations and other groups.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] Judging from various signs, a "knockdown, drag-out" fight will occur when the bill is submitted to the Senate on March 1. Taft admitted that the Senate had made greater progress than the original proposal of the State Department, but still believes that the amount is too high. The group of amendments has threatened to devise a battlefield strategy. Other obstacles to the aid to Europe plan include the appropriation committees of both houses, which hold the life and death power over the total amount of funds.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Secretary of State Marshall Delivers Speech, Endorses Western European Alliance; U.S. Aid to Europe Aims to Establish Peace <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Des Moines, Iowa, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall praised the proposed political alliance of Western Europe on the evening of the 13th, saying that it is our greatest hope. Marshall also warned that the success of the Marshall Plan is the last chance for the world to avoid Communist domination. After Marshall's special plane stopped in Knoxville, Tennessee, he addressed a crowd of national rural studies gathered here via radio. In his speech, Marshall made the first direct comment on British Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent proposal for a "Western European Alliance" of Britain, France, and other countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters] Marshall said, "We, the American people, are now facing the most important decision in history, which will have a far-reaching impact on the entire world. Like all other major decisions, once decided, it cannot be changed, and there is no chance for a second guess. The major decision we are about to take on our foreign policy today is made in the American way, but there is a danger here, that we may pay too much attention to the details, thus neglecting the most important goal of the European recovery plan. We should make the goal of this plan and its relationship with the future of the world clear. This is a great effort representing concrete leadership. Once adopted, it will be our greatest historical masterpiece on the world civilization table. If there is no mistake, the result of its success or failure will determine the survival of the world, so that democratic free economic stability and peace can be maintained.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and its Communist comrades used the post-war crisis to gain control of all of Europe. If Western Europe has a stable and sound situation, the Soviet leaders will be able to reach an agreement on peace terms more clearly. Congress will soon take a decision that will determine the long-term history and the future destiny of our country. In my personal opinion, I think we are at a crossroads? There are two paths for our future: we can decide that the difficulties and dangers of the European recovery plan are too great, so there is no need to do anything; we can also deal with the current situation with half a heart and inappropriate situation. As far as the latter is concerned, its effect is equal to doing nothing, but at the same time we still have to pay a huge price. More serious than the material effect is the psychological distrust of American leadership. If we take this decision, Western Europe will inevitably be under the same control as Eastern Europe. The methods adopted in each country may be different, but the result will be the same. Under these conditions, free institutions will not exist on the European continent for a long time. I stated after the failure of the Moscow Conference last year that the U.S. government holds a world-recognized leadership position and can take several active actions to save the situation. The passive attitude we have adopted in the past can no longer be tolerated. The decision at that time was to convene the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference, which became the most important step in building a peaceful world. British Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent proposal indicates that European countries have taken another step beyond the agreement on economic cooperation to consider a Western European alliance. This development is truly our great hope. I hope that the American people will weigh the gains and losses at home and the importance of the goals of the European recovery plan. I think all Americans believe that America is the most powerful country in the world. We must seek a better life for people all over the world. We have a great responsibility. Leaders have the responsibility to lead. The more critical the situation is, the greater the need for leaders to take action. This is what I ask of the people across the country today."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 14th] A spokesman for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the proposal to convene the Sixteen Nations Conference under the Marshall Plan is under discussion. All parties seem to agree. He said that the motive for convening a new conference was the result of discussions by the inspection committee organized by representatives of Britain, the United States, and France. He said that the Sixteen Nations Conference is expected to begin before March 28.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Pidoux Elucidates France's Position: The European Continent Cannot Tolerate Division; Solving the German Problem Requires Ensuring It Cannot Re-Aggress <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] French Foreign Minister Pidoux, in his address during the foreign policy debate in the National Assembly, announced that representatives from Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will soon convene in Rome to study the conditions for establishing a customs union. Pidoux reaffirmed that aid under the Marshall Plan is indispensable for European welfare and world peace. Pidoux also emphasized that France believes Europe is an integral whole, and the current state of division is intolerable.</p>
<p>France believes that the scope of Europe extends from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea to the Ural Mountains, encompassed by the spirit of Christian humanism. However, today, the traditional civilization of Europe is represented only by the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan. The division of Europe is the responsibility of the Soviet Union, and the result of this division is a great misfortune, but France does not accept the current division as the final state. When referring to the relationship between Britain and France, Pidoux expressed that the French government greatly welcomes Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent proposal. France is willing to hold discussions with any European country that shares the same views. Regarding the German problem, Pidoux believes that Germany's potential for aggression should be eliminated forever. The only solution for Germany's eastern border issue is to integrate Germany into the European community, establishing a peaceful Germany without aggressive intent. Pidoux also emphasized that France has no preconditions for economic aid, pointing out that if other countries can propose aid to France under the same independent conditions, France would be happy to accept it. Pidoux also warned that the victors of the last world war, wanting to split Germany into two, would be a dangerous undertaking. France firmly opposes the re-establishment of the Germany of the past, and France will never allow a Bismarckian Germany to reappear. France advocates effective control, but has never opposed Germany's economic recovery, only feeling that Germany's economic recovery should not take precedence over that of the allied nations.</p>

<p>Policy Underwent a Transformation in a Panic</p>
<p>During 1940, our relationship with the Soviet Union was governed by a desire not to do anything that would push it further into Germany's embrace, while also trying to limit our exports to the Soviet Union to a certain extent so that it would not have surplus military materials that could be transferred to Germany.</p>
<p>Due to the war, the Soviet Union was unable to obtain many types of military materials and wanted to maintain trade relations with the United States. However, it did not understand why we did not simply open our arms to accept it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it demanded the impossible. It tried for months to buy a battleship from an American shipbuilder. The President and I were willing to build one for it, but the Soviet Union insisted that the latest American equipment and inventions must be included. The Navy could agree to build a battleship that was at least as new as the ones we currently had, but of course, it was unwilling to give the Soviet Union all the latest secrets that the United States had painstakingly researched over the years, some of which were being installed on the new battleships we were building at the time.</p>
<p>On April 2, 1940, I and Oumansky had a frank discussion on US-Soviet relations. Oumansky was one of the most difficult foreign diplomats we had ever encountered. His attitude and words were often insulting, and he was hostile to anyone among us, as if he was inherently capable of it. He was rude, demanding concessions as if they were a matter of course, and protesting our actions as if they were extremely bad mistakes. In my opinion, he had caused considerable damage to US-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>When Oumansky came to see me this time, he had many things to complain about. He began by listing many so-called grievances. He pointed out that some American companies refused to allow Soviet engineers or those preparing to purchase goods to inspect their factories; that some Soviet men and women of some standing who had obtained temporary passports to come to the United States were detained on Ellis Island for a long time; and our moral embargo (related to the Soviet-Finnish War). Then he bluntly asked whether our government wanted to continue or abandon commercial relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I was determined not to express any opinion.</p>
<p>Then, he pointed out that the moral embargo was only applicable to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I pointed out to him that this applied to all countries engaged in the bombing of civilians.</p>
<p>Oumansky denied that his country was engaged in the bombing of civilians.</p>
<p>I replied, "We have very satisfactory evidence that the Soviet Union is indeed bombing civilians. Given the language you use when discussing this matter, I know that I cannot convince you of my view, just as you cannot convince me of the opposite."</p>
<p>Every time the ambassador tried to explain his government's peaceful intentions, I always tried to give him the impression that I expressed doubt.</p>
<p>The conversation continued for nearly an hour. Oumansky concluded by saying that his government had no intention of interfering in the province of Bessarabia in eastern Romania, which belonged to Russia before the 1914-1918 war; the Soviet Union did not believe that Turkey would participate in the Allied intervention in the Baku oil region; the Soviet Union had no intentions in any part of the Near East; but he avoided topics related to Finland and Germany.</p>
<p>On May 29, I sent a telegram to our embassy in the Soviet Union, requesting information on the movement of Soviet troops towards the Romanian border. American Minister to Romania Gunther had telegraphed me, saying that a large number of Soviet troops were concentrated along the Romanian border. The Romanian side believed that Stalin was shocked by the German victory in the West and was trying to obtain Romanian territory so that he could have better bargaining chips when negotiating with Hitler. They mentioned the province of Bessarabia in eastern Romania.</p>
<p>After our chargé d'affaires in Moscow, Thurston, met with Foreign Minister Molotov, he telegraphed me on May 31, saying that Molotov was extremely dissatisfied with the United States. He was particularly angry about the cancellation of Soviet orders by American companies, saying it was unfriendly and intolerable. When Thurston explained that we were also requisitioning orders from other governments for reasons of national defense, so there was no discrimination against the Soviet Union, Molotov became even more angry. He said that we had no right to change the normal methods of interaction between governments, and our actions were illegal and intolerable; we must bear full responsibility for this, and it would not be good for us.</p>
<p>But in early June, Thurston began to tell us that the Soviet government's attitude towards the Allies had changed. Moscow was shocked by the rapid advance of the German army and now hoped that France would continue to fight. Previously, Moscow had supported the French Communist Party in obstructing the activities of the Reynaud government.</p>
<p>Ambassador Oumansky, who was the embodiment of insult at his worst, came to see me on June 12. I knew that he was going to protest about one thing, and that was that our own government was taking over the machine tools that his government had previously ordered for reasons of national defense. I was quite familiar with the many meetings he and other officials of the State Department had held on this issue, and the rude tone he had adopted at the time, so this time I started the discussion myself.</p>
<p>After mentioning the many efforts we had made to cooperate with every other country that was inclined to peace—especially hoping to obtain the cooperation of the Soviet Union—I went on to say: "When we see all these efforts are completely in vain, we feel unspeakable disappointment and regret. In this situation, my government has begun a new policy of arming, arming, and continuously arming, in order to defend itself against any possible enemy. With this as the goal, my government does not hesitate to collect the necessary materials, or to preserve all the goods necessary for our day-and-night arms program."</p>
<p>I finally said that we were extremely disappointed that we had not obtained fuller and more extensive cooperation from the Soviet Union than in the past seven years.</p>
<p>Oumansky began to talk about what he said was trade discrimination being practiced by our government. I interrupted him immediately:</p>
<p>"In view of the current emergency situation, I am amazed that your government is paying attention to such small disputes. Your government is giving preferential treatment to other countries in its trade methods, discriminating against us, and we have nothing to say. This includes transporting large quantities of military supplies to Germany."</p>
<p>Oumansky pointed out that this was normal trade.</p>
<p>I replied, "No matter what it includes, a large number of supplies urgently needed for war, this makes it very different from normal trade. Of course, as far as my government is concerned, the Soviet Union has the full right to conduct this kind of trade. But during the Italo-Ethiopian War, we adopted a very different policy towards Italy, and at that time we used a moral embargo to reduce our trade to pre-war levels. But my main point is to explain our current policy of preserving raw materials to increase armament."</p>
<p>Then I said that because we sincerely hoped that the Soviet Union could play a major role in peace, the President was very willing to step in and mediate before the Soviet Union invaded Finland.</p>
<p>Oumansky said in a rather sarcastic tone—sarcasm that would come out of the ambassador's mouth as easily as chaff from a threshing machine—yes, but his government's reaction to a certain speech by the President at the time was not very good. He was referring to the President's condemnation of the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland.</p>
<p>I replied, "When a huge country is holding a small, helpless country by the throat to suffocate it to death, I must admit that the government of this large country will not have a good reaction or take action towards our mediation. In this situation, the only way is to remain silent as much as possible."</p>
<p>The ambassador seemed a little uneasy, but did not answer.</p>
<p>Remembering the fierce and arrogant talk that Molotov had given to Chargé d'Affaires Thurston in Moscow a few days earlier, and the loud insults that the ambassador had offered in Washington whenever he had the chance, I expressed my opinion:</p>
<p>"Mr. Molotov seems very "arrogant". I also hear from time to time in Washington that Mr. Molotov's representative is making rude remarks. For seven years, I have been subjected to sharp criticism for trying to maintain and improve somewhat decent relations with the Soviet Union, and it seems that this is the reward I have received."</p>
<p>When Oumansky continued to express his dissatisfaction, I said that I could list a long list of things that I felt sincerely dissatisfied with about the Soviet Union, but I was unwilling to say more than I had already said. He asked me—or rather, forced me—to say some of the things I could think of. Coincidentally, Ambassador Steinhardt had already returned to Washington from Moscow and had written me several pages of things that I was dissatisfied with about the Soviet Union, and these pages were in my hand. So I read the first page of the points that Steinhardt criticized, and said that I could read several more pages, but I did not want to.</p>
<p>Finally, I mentioned my lengthy and sincere efforts to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and said: "Whenever the Soviet Union deems it appropriate, my government will be happy to resume a policy that seeks to more fully develop peaceful relations and mutually beneficial cooperation in every practical way. Our trade with the Soviet Union is relatively small. It would be a mistake to exaggerate our special emphasis on it, but we are willing to maintain this trade and develop it, as long as this development takes place under conditions that are mutually acceptable to both of our countries."</p>
<p>Almost at the time of this conversation, I began to receive telegrams from our representatives in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, reporting that the Soviet Union was demanding the complete occupation of these countries by Soviet troops and that the governments of these countries should be reorganized to be more friendly to the Soviet Union. The Baltic countries had to agree. The Soviet occupation began on June 15.</p>
<p>One reason for this action was very clear; Stalin hoped to obtain a better defensive position to deal with Germany. Our Minister to Latvia, Felts, telegraphed me on June 19, saying that, according to reliable sources, the Kremlin was extremely worried about recent developments, and was almost at a loss. Stalin's policy was based on the assumption of a long-term war of attrition in the West. After the collapse of France, this policy also collapsed. Hitler recently stated that he did not want to destroy the British Empire, with the aim of inducing Britain to propose peace, but the Soviet Union was panicked, fearing that the problem in Western Europe would be resolved at the expense of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic countries, it took another defensive measure in Europe, occupying the province of Bessarabia in Romania and part of Bukovina. The fears that our Minister to Bucharest, Gunther, had expressed to me in May had now become a reality. Now, the defensive position of the Soviet Union's southwestern border had been strengthened. The occupation of the Baltic countries and Romanian territory had straightened the arc of its western border.</p>
<p>Telegrams from our representatives in various places pointed to one conclusion, that the Soviet Union had not notified the Hitler government of these actions beforehand. German-Soviet relations were now beginning to show tension.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] According to signs on the 14th, Japan's new prime minister will be produced in the Lower House within the next week by a name-by-name vote.

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] New York, 14th Broadcast: Batavia news, Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Hatta said today, Indonesian Republic will join the Indonesian Federal Provisional Government, even if it give up some of its current powers, it will not care.

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] American representative on the UN Security Council Indonesia Mediation Group, Graham, resigned today, and return to the position of president of the University of North Carolina. President Truman has ordered former Consul General to Batavia, DuBois, to succeed him.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 13th] After the Lake Success released a UN speech of the spokesman of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute mediation committee today, it caused a bad reaction from the Dutch side. Therefore, the Dutch representatives have requested a postponement of the Dutch-Indonesian delegation comprehensive committee scheduled to be held today, so the next stage of Dutch-Indonesian relations has been delayed to start. The purpose of the comprehensive committee is to negotiate the steps for the two delegations to start political negotiations. However, well-informed Dutch sources still deny that the Dutch side is unwilling to continue negotiations. The UN mediation committee spokesman's speech released yesterday at Lake Success stated that the Security Council needs the mediation committee to continue its activities until the establishment of the United States of Indonesia. During the existence of the mediation committee, a solution can be established within two or three months. At the same time, plebiscites in the disputed areas can also be held under the supervision of the mediation committee. The Dutch-Indonesian government's communique stated today that the task of the mediation committee is only to mediate. Exceeding this will inevitably damage the trust between the two sides. The mediation committee spokesman also said that if fair votes are held in Java, Sumatra, and Madura, 90 percent of the people will support the Republic government. The spokesman also said: Autonomous regions outside Java, Sumatra, and Madura can decide whether these regions are under the puppet government by holding plebiscites. The Dutch communique pointed out that the spokesman's suggestion to hold this plebiscite is improper, and the aforementioned autonomous regions are completely outside the scope of the mediation committee's authority.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Seven Organizations Confer and Decide to Calculate Rent Based on Index; To Be Submitted to the Municipal Council for Discussion Before Being Sent to the City Council for Approval <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, representatives from seven organizations, including the City Council, the Land Administration Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, the General Reserve Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Real Estate Industry Association, and the Local Court, met at the Land Administration Bureau to discuss the issue of housing rent standards in this city. Based on collected data from the Municipal Government Statistics Office's cost of living index for workers, clerks, and teachers, including the rent index, they exchanged opinions and concluded that the previous method of calculating rent by multiples was not suitable for actual conditions. They decided in principle not to set a fixed multiple but to calculate rent based on a discounted rate of the cost of living index. It has not been decided which of the three categories—workers, clerks, or teachers—will be used as the basis for the index, but in any case, a significant discount must be applied. The representatives unanimously agreed that teachers have low incomes, and the rent for their housing should be subject to a particularly large discount when calculated using the index. It is estimated that city rents can be divided into three categories: (1) Commercial properties, with a smaller discount applied to the index; (2) Residential properties, with a larger discount applied; and (3) Housing for teachers, with an even larger discount applied to the index. According to Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping in an interview with reporters, the fundamental reason for discussing rent standards is the housing shortage. Therefore, the meeting decided that to encourage construction, rents for newly built houses should not be restricted, in order to promote housing construction. The principles agreed upon by the representatives of the seven organizations, as well as the question of which cost of living index to use and the size of the discount, still need to be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion and then to the City Council for approval. It is hoped that the public and citizens will provide more opinions on this issue, so that the city's rent standards are not only reasonable but also adapted to actual conditions.</p>
<p>According to the December 1947 cost of living index for clerks in this city, the housing index was 15,600 times. The housing category in the worker index was 46,400 times (including water, electricity, coal, and firewood). The housing index in the teacher index was 9,140 times.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Planned Implementation of Rationing of Daily Necessities; Commander Xuan Convenes Meeting of Various Agencies <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, believes that Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and fluctuations in prices affect the entire country. However, to stabilize prices in Shanghai, there must be fundamental measures. Therefore, he has suggested to the highest authorities that a comprehensive rationing of daily necessities be implemented and has been ordered to study detailed measures. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Xuan convened a meeting of dozens of representatives from relevant agencies in the city and economic experts, presided over by Xuan himself, to discuss this issue in detail. After the meeting, Xuan met with reporters and said that the comprehensive rationing of daily necessities is a major measure, and there must be sufficient preparation in advance. The consumption and supply figures of daily necessities must first be accurately investigated before a plan for rationing can be implemented. Regarding the investigation method, the Garrison Command has drafted a plan, which will be discussed and revised with relevant agencies. It is expected that a thorough investigation can be carried out in March. The resulting figures will be reported to the central government as the basis for implementing rationing. This investigation will be carried out by the Economic Group of the Garrison Command and the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, in cooperation with relevant parties. Xuan also said that the rationing of daily necessities indicates that the government is responsible for the people's livelihood. Rationing will be maintained for a considerable period until the economic situation returns to normal.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Municipal First Slaughterhouse Slaughtering Over a Thousand Cattle and Sheep Daily; Using Electrical Anesthesia to Reduce Suffering <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal First Slaughterhouse hosted a tour for various sectors yesterday during the Lunar New Year holiday. About a hundred people from various newspaper offices, the United States Information Service, and Chinese and foreign dignitaries were in attendance. First, Director Xu Shigui led the tour to visit modern facilities such as livestock feeding pens, slaughterhouses, cattle hanging rooms, cattle sawing rooms, cold storage rooms, inspection rooms, and mad dog inspection stations. He then explained that in order to promote the movement to protect livestock, the slaughtering method generally uses electrical anesthesia to reduce the suffering of livestock. The slaughterhouse is also working to improve livestock breeding methods and studying a plan to unify the inspection of meat products throughout the city in order to promote the health of citizens' food. According to reports, the slaughterhouse's current slaughtering equipment is the best in the Far East, capable of slaughtering over a thousand cattle and sheep daily. Together with the Municipal Second Slaughterhouse, it is the largest slaughterhouse supplying meat to the city's citizens. At the same time, the slaughterhouse also has a diseased animal rendering plant specializing in the rendering of fat, meat powder, bone meal, and other by-products. In addition, it also handles livestock and poultry breeding and veterinary research for the health testing institute, making it a very large-scale operation.</p>

<p>President Chiang attaches great importance to this year's agricultural loans. It is reported that the President recently instructed the Four Banks Joint Treasury to make agricultural loans the most important task this year and instructed that more funds be allocated for agricultural loans. Li Shuming, General Manager of the China Farmers Bank, just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. The reporter specifically visited him for this purpose. He revealed that the President is very concerned about this year's agricultural loans and said that a detailed plan has been drafted on how the bank will promote the agricultural loan plan this year and submitted to the Four Banks Joint Treasury. He has also exchanged opinions with Governor Zhang of the National Bank several times to conduct technical research. It is expected that the plan will be submitted for discussion at the Four Banks Board of Directors meeting to be held in Nanjing next Thursday. Regarding the focus of this year's agricultural loans, he said that the focus will be on increasing production, especially food and cotton. Li also analyzed the current financial and economic problems, stating that increasing production is the first priority, and the most important things are food and cotton. He also said that once the Four Banks meeting makes a decision, the bank will mobilize a large number of personnel to promote the work, cooperate with national policies, and achieve practical production increase results. As for the loan methods and measures, improvements have been researched and made to those that were found to be unsatisfactory in the past to ensure that farmers receive the practical benefits of agricultural loans.</p>

<p>Since the Spring Festival, the solicitation work for the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" has been relatively smooth. The Huaming Tobacco Company's special "Air Bookstore" has solicited more than 60 million yuan in donations for us. Together with the previous amount, it has exceeded 100 million yuan. During the "Special Program" on the second day of the Lunar New Year, the Continental Great China Company also solicited more than 10 million yuan in donations for us. We express our utmost gratitude to these enthusiastic listeners, because their assistance has gradually brought the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" closer to its expected goal. However, as in the past, most of the donors belong to the middle class. We hope that wealthy people in the industrial and commercial sectors can also give us some help. With your help, countless poor students are waiting for relief.</p>
<p>Regarding applications, more than half of the schools have already completed and sent them in. In order to expedite the scholarship application process, we hope that the remaining schools can send them in full within the next few days so that we can conduct a centralized review.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Regarding the Embezzlement and Corruption of the Jianghai Customs, the Full Text of the Capital District Court's Judgment (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>(3) Defendant Zhang Baohui's Part:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Zhang Baohui was the lowest-ranking customs officer in the Import License Verification Section. According to his testimony to this court, he stated, "The import of galvanized iron sheets by Yi Feng &amp; Co. was first mentioned by Yue Xinmin. I said that the merchant's commission was not our concern, but he said that Mei Futang and others were threatening him. I said you could resign. Later, Yue asked Zhang Yuan for help. I heard that Director Yin (referring to Yin Lansun) had also agreed. Later, Zhang Yuan sent US$1,500. This was due to the environment." Yin cunningly denied the joint extortion of property, and claimed that Yin Lansun had always opposed it. Later, in order to relieve Yue Xinmin from the coercion of Mei Futang and Zhang Gaozhen, he reluctantly agreed. Therefore, after the goods were taken away, Yin instructed me to cut off the signed parts at both ends of the license to prevent anyone from discovering who approved it," and so on. If this were true, it would be implausible that the defendants not only did not extort anyone, but were also threatened. Moreover, customs officers Yin Lansun and others, as well as the colluding former customs officer Zhang Yuan, repeatedly detained the slips, ordering Zhang Gaozhen to pass through Mei Futang, Shen Yanlu, Fang Maolin, and Mao Fengxiang. Each time it passed through a person, it was detained once and the extortion increased once. It was only after Lu Gengquan was subjected to their repeated extortion that he was able to retrieve the documents, as described earlier in the section on Yin Lansun. The amount of US$8,000 extorted and the amount shared with Yin Lansun can be considered as the actual implementation of jointly sharing the extorted property. As for destroying the license, although it was to destroy criminal evidence, it was a natural result of his criminal behavior and will not be separately punished according to law.</p>
<p>Regarding the Lifengyong pigment case, he testified, "Lifengyong declared on August 14, 1936. Before being ordered to pay attention on the 27th of that month, it was not necessary to submit it to Director Yin (referring to Yin Lansun) first. I did the initial review, and Yin did the final review. We got 70 million. I didn't ask for money in the Tianhe Taikang case. In the Minfu caustic soda case, we got US$3,000. We didn't get any money in the wool case." However, according to his confession, "Min stated to Zhang Yuan each time that things needed to be approved by the director (referring to Yin Lansun). Zhang Yuan paid without calculating, and stated that at most a little embellishment would be enough. As for the caustic soda case declared by Chen Liangbian, because of a distant relative relationship with Chen, out of consideration for face, after Zhang (referring to Zhang Yuan) and Chen discussed it, Director Yin agreed, and we got three to five thousand US dollars, which was later reduced to five hundred US dollars" (see Bureau Volume 2, page 99). This is inconsistent, which shows that the previous statements of "not getting money" and not asking for money were all evasions during the trial and cannot be believed. Judging from his words "at most a little embellishment would be enough," it is obviously a general intention to commit a crime. There is no doubt that he jointly and continuously violated his duties and accepted bribes.</p>
<p>(4) Defendant Zhang Yuan's Part:</p>
<p>This court heard Zhang Yuan's testimony, which stated, "In the Yi Feng white iron sheet case, Yue Xinmin brought the documents and specifically checked them with Yin Lansun, who said that they needed to be studied by the Import Control Committee and told me to return the license documents. Later, Yue Xinmin sent US$5,000. Yue Xinmin got US$3,000 alone, and asked me to take out US$500 to distribute to the people on the dock. Only then did Yin Lansun issue the documents and approve the import. Min, Yin Lansun, and Zhang Baohui each got US$1,500. In the Lifengyong aniline oil case, 330 million was sent. In the Tianhe Dakang pigment case, 90 million legal tender was sent. In the Yifeng wool case, 300 million was sent. Min divided 100 million with Yin Lansun and Zhang Baohui. As for the Minfu Company caustic soda case, a total of US$16,000 and 120 million legal tender were divided. Min, Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Kuanhui each got US$3,000. The remaining US$4,000 and 120 million legal tender were spent on the dock." This is generally consistent with the repeated confessions made during the investigations by the Bureau of Confidentiality and the Procuratorate of this court, and is also consistent with the documents attached to the case file. It is beyond doubt that as a non-public official, he jointly extorted money from Lu Gengquan with public officials, and participated in the acceptance of bribes in the joint and continuous violation of duties and acceptance of bribes by Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui. Furthermore, regarding Chen Lianggang's behavior of adding caustic soda to the license, he first obtained Chen's consent, which was also stated by Chen Liangxie, showing that he provided mental assistance beforehand. However, this was a method of participating in the above-mentioned breach of duty and acceptance of bribes, and should be judged according to the more serious crime of incitement.</p>
<p>The defendants Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui, in their capacity as customs officers, extorted money from Lu Gengquan on the pretext of a case, and used the former customs officer Zhang Yuan to pass it on and share the implementation, eventually dividing US$8,000 (the US$5,360 divided by the accomplices Fang Maolin and others is not included and should be handled in a separate case), which is extremely heinous. Although Zhang Yuan is not a public official, he should bear the same criminal responsibility according to law for jointly committing the crime. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan should each be sentenced to death, and Zhang Baohui's rank among the customs officers is lower. Because he was forced by the situation of Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan, he participated in the implementation. This court observed his words and demeanor and saw that he contained remorse, so he can be spared one death and sentenced to life imprisonment, and each of them should be deprived of their civil rights for life. Furthermore, the defendants Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui, in their capacity as customs officers, with a general intention to commit a crime, continuously committed several acts, jointly receiving bribes for acts that violated their duties, should be judged as one crime. Although Zhang Yuan is not a public official, according to the above explanation, he should bear the same criminal responsibility as Yin Lansun and others, so each should be sentenced to death. Zhang Baohui's circumstances are lighter, as mentioned above, so he is sentenced to life imprisonment, and each is deprived of their civil rights for life.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the above-mentioned two crimes committed by the defendants have neither a general intention to commit a crime nor the same crime name, so they should be punished together. The prosecutor's indictment generally regards them as continuous crimes, committing the crime of receiving bribes for acts that violate their duties. This court should separately determine the crimes and impose penalties after changing their legal provisions, and determine the penalties to be executed. The defendants Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan are each to be executed. Zhang Baohui is sentenced to life imprisonment, and each is deprived of their civil rights for life. Of the property obtained by extortion, a total of US$13,360, except for the US$5,360 obtained by the accomplices Fang Maolin and others, which will be handled in a separate case, and the US$1,225 paid by Zhang Yuan, which was issued to Lu Gengquan by the Bureau of Confidentiality of the Ministry of National Defense for collection, the remaining US$6,775, converted into legal tender at the market price of 90,000 times per dollar at the time, totaling 600,975,000 legal tender, and the total amount of bribes received, totaling 1,505,000,000 legal tender, will be jointly and severally paid by the defendants, separately returned and confiscated (see Interpretation No. 1124 of the 29th Year of the Court). Regarding the returned portion, the victim Lu Gengquan has applied for a combined explanation.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, it is determined in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, Article 291 and Article 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 2, Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 7, Article 7, Paragraph 1 and Article 13 of the Punishment of Corruption Regulations, Article 28, Article 50, Article 56, Article 51, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 8, Article 37, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, as stated in the main text.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Tian Jihou attended the court to perform his duties in this case.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The First Train on the Nanrao Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanchang, 9th Telegraphic Dispatch] The bridge over Liangjiadu, the final and most arduous section of the reconstruction project of the Nanchang-Shangrao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, was completed on the 3rd of this month. The first train from Shangrao to Nanchang completed its test run at noon on the 3rd and passed through the bridge at 1:00 PM, heading towards Nanchang.</p>
<p>"First to Open to Traffic" is a creed of the staff of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. They overcame various difficulties with their hard work and perseverance to complete the "road" and "bridge" projects.</p>
<p>Overview of the Mileage of the Entire Section</p>
<p>The entire section's mileage, from Shangrao to Xiangtang, is 119 kilometers, divided into four general sections, twelve subsections, thirty-eight bridges, and twenty-three stations. Under the goal of rushing to complete the work, the various projects have only completed a rough shape. There are still 68 kilometers of steel rails, some of which are 35 pounds, or 55, 60, 63 pounds of various types of light steel rails pieced together. The equipment for ticket sales and train operation, some of the switches have not been fully laid, the platforms have not been completed, or there are only a few simple office supplies. Currently, none of the stations in the entire section have electric lighting equipment or completed ticket office layouts. The train's telephones, route signs, flags, mileage markers, etc., are also being rushed to manufacture.</p>
<p>The Construction Process of the Large Bridge</p>
<p>The Liangjiadu Bridge project is second only to the Ganjiang Bridge in Zhangshu on the entire line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It suffered painful destruction during the war in May of the 28th year of the Republic of China. The first time the bridge was bombed into the river, the second time the piers were bombed away, and the third time even the bridge foundations submerged in the water were completely bombed away. Only in February of the year before last did the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway begin to clear the old beams and damaged bridge foundations. The clearing work was not completed until the end of October last year. Construction began in July, and the delay in the arrival of the steel beams made Director Huang Shouyi, who was in charge of the bridge work, very anxious.</p>
<p>In order to quickly achieve their mission, the bridge workers suffered from difficulties in funding, materials, and harsh weather. The steel beams ordered in Canada were originally scheduled to be delivered in June of last year, but the steel production in Canada after the war was greatly reduced and has not been delivered as scheduled. In addition to salvaging some old beams sunk at the bottom of the river for modification and patching, the bridge construction office also obtained a small amount of UNRRA supplies - steel beams. However, some of these steel beams were not of sufficient size, and some were of uneven height. Therefore, the steel beam of the fifth span was laboriously connected with 20-meter new steel.</p>
<p>The Bridge Workers Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>The bridge is 502.70 meters long, with a total of fourteen spans, each span being 35 meters in length. Forty-one teams of people specialized in hammering rivets and drilling steel holes, with more than 100,000 holes drilled. From these drilling and hammering works, one can see the arduousness of the bridge construction. They completely relied on manpower to overcome the difficulties of lacking materials and tools. There was not a single crane in the entire project. To lift a section of the bridge weighing 80 tons from the river without a crane, they used self-made pulleys to lift it. The new steel beams, UNRRA supplies produced in Canada, were only 20 meters long, and there was a difference of 15 meters on the 35-meter bridge pier spacing. They painstakingly used the destroyed old beams to connect them. Because there were not enough tools, and also relying on manpower, it took three months to assemble one span of steel beams. Therefore, the work of hammering rivets and drilling holes was unexpectedly busy. Although the traffic is now open, they are still constantly hammering rivets.</p>
<p>Working in Heavy Snowstorms</p>
<p>How severe were the several heavy snowstorms! Director Huang Shouyi, who was in charge of the arduous project, and his more than 1,000 employees, were constantly working. As the project progressed to the final stage, they worked night shifts for more than a month. Some people's hair and beards grew long, because these unsung heroes did not have time to groom themselves. Director Huang Shouyi received the good news at the construction site that his wife was giving birth in the hospital, but he was unable to find time to return to Nanchang to take care of her for a moment. The newborn "Seventh Miss" was named "Jiancheng," which means "completion," to commemorate Director Huang's successful supervision of the construction of this large bridge.</p>
<p>Local Tyrants Show Their Might</p>
<p>Yingtan is the future transportation hub of the southeast. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Beijing-Jiangxi, and Fujian-Jiangxi railways will all connect here. Every inch of land on this small highland on the bank of the Xin River is a future base for construction and operation. There are already many merchants preparing to operate inns and transportation businesses there, but there is a force of "local tyrants" here who are unreasonably hindering the progress of these constructions.</p>
<p>With the victory of the return and the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to traffic, there has been a long time, but the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's ticket office has not yet been completed. All the staff of the station are squeezed into a small bungalow, handling their busy work day and night. The small office space is so crowded that they can hardly stretch comfortably. Every employee has to run a considerable distance to eat and sleep after completing their work, because there is no way to build their office buildings and dormitories. "Local tyrants" are hindering their work everywhere, for example: not allowing the oil press factory planned by the railway bureau in Yingtan to start work, not allowing merchants and local landowners to enter into lease contracts, and even restricting new houses to belong to the landlord after two years, and paying the landlord one dou of rice per foot of land per month. The "local tyrant" said: You can rent land to build houses, but you are not allowed to carry water and transport stones through my Gui family's land, and you must prohibit tenants from freely entering and leaving.</p>
<p>So many merchants are unable to solve the land problem, so they have not set up a transportation inn near the station since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway opened to traffic.</p>
<p>The lawless behavior of the "local tyrant" has increased the hatred of outsiders towards the natives. It is said that someone is brewing a resistance against the "Gui tyrant," which is likely to cause a bloody tragedy. We hope that the local authorities will pay attention to the evolution of the incident and the elimination of unreasonable facts.</p>
<p>The express train from Hangzhou to Shangrao on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will extend the original express train to Yingtan from the 4th due to the opening of the Nanrao section. From that day on, the traffic revolution will also begin to operate between Nanchang and Yingtan.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is "First to Open to Traffic," should strengthen the "Safety First" measures in the future to enhance the safety of the railway and passengers. (Our reporter Liu Zao)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Batavia, 10th Telegraphic Dispatch] Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands, Indonesian thugs in Java have resumed looting and killing overseas Chinese. In the past half month, thugs have attacked Zhiganbei, Sukabumi, Bogor, and other places, causing many casualties and property losses to overseas Chinese. On the 26th of last month, more than a thousand thugs suddenly attacked near汨水, killing and injuring more than a dozen overseas Chinese, burning down sixteen shops, and causing significant property losses. Last month, in the Lengjiabadong District of Sumatra, fifty-four overseas Chinese were killed by the thugs, their heads and bodies separated, a truly unbearable tragedy. It is investigated that during the ceasefire period, thugs actually looted and killed overseas Chinese, disregarding the law. It is hoped that the Republican and our government will quickly stop the violence, lodge protests, and effectively protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The Dutch and Indonesian governments recently felt that China is one of the five world powers, and that Chinese is listed as an international language. Moreover, there are many overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and the relationship is close. The Chinese Department of the Indonesian University in Batavia opened last month, and there are Dutch women among the students. Starting this semester, Dutch primary schools (referring to those with a majority of overseas Chinese students) will add ninety minutes of Chinese instruction per week. This semester, an Indonesian student entered the first year of junior high school at a Batavia middle school. Other schools also have Indonesian students enrolled, indicating that the Dutch and Indonesian people are paying attention to Chinese.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou, 14th Telegraphic Dispatch] In the last ten days of the twelfth lunar month, a shocking murder case occurred at the Provincial Sandu Middle School in Sanduao, Min. Huang Yuanxun, the dean of students of the school, had ordered some students with failing conduct grades to withdraw from school around the 24th. On the evening of the 24th, his beloved son (Weizhi) went missing. It was not until five days later that the child's body was found on the beach in front of the school. There were strangulation marks on his chest, proving that he had been strangled to death and abandoned on the beach. After the incident, the Sandu Water Police immediately investigated and determined that Chen Ziyin, a student from Fuding County among the withdrawn students, was highly suspected. They immediately invited the Ningde County District Procuratorate to arrest him and bring him to the county for interrogation. Note: The dead child was only eleven years old, and he was usually innocent, lively, and very lovable. His parents are distraught by his untimely death.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanchang, 8th Telegraphic Dispatch] Tao Gang's bandits have moved from the border of Xiuning, Wu Yuan, and Qimen in Anhui to Shewu Mountain on the border between Jiangxi and Anhui. The main peak of the mountain is in Xiuning County, Anhui, and its spurs extend into the counties of Fuliang (southern foothills), Qimen (western foothills), and Wuyuan (eastern foothills). Tao's bandits have taken this mountain as their base and are operating along the areas of Wangcun in Xiuning, Zhanggongshan in Wuyuan, and Meixi in Qimen. There are about 100 bandits in the Wangcun area, with more than 40 rifles. There are about 100 bandits in Zhanggongshan, with more than 50 rifles. There are more than 200 bandits in Meixi, with more than 100 long and short guns.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Su County, 11th Telegraphic Dispatch] In Su County, which has been hit by multiple disasters of floods, locusts, and bandits, more than half of the 1.3 million people are hungry, cold, and fearful. They do not seem to have a festive or tense feeling about the old Lunar New Year. The county government and the police bureau posted notices everywhere "Advocating Thrift, Prohibiting Gifts, and Severe Punishment for Violators," but the crowds carrying gifts in the streets and alleys were still bustling to and fro. Tea and food shops even announced that they were out of stock and closed their doors. The officers and soldiers of the 24th Division stationed in the area, the strong men of Shangqiu in the Pacific, took advantage of the Spring Festival to organize several teams of "stilts" to perform everywhere, and the army and the people enjoyed themselves together, adding a little vitality to this lonely mountain city.</p>

Movie theaters, theaters, and photo studios are full of customers. The stores that were originally planning to close have been encouraged by this prosperous scene and will continue to struggle. The clouds of sorrow on New Year's Eve were blown away by the north wind, and after the festival, the ice and snow melted, and leather clothes became a major burden. According to the elders, the celestial phenomena were very good when welcoming the gods, which is a sign of a bumper harvest.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 14th dispatch] Notorious hoodlum Bai Que, 21 years old, has been arrested by the police after extorting merchants and raping women in the city, committing heinous crimes. He has been exiled to "Burning Island" (Green Island) for permanent imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e125">A Glimpse of Tibet Since the Regency of Rongzeng Daza <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th airmail] Tibet, with an area of 1,215,788 square kilometers, is divided into Front Tibet and Rear Tibet. The capital of Front Tibet is Lhasa, the residence of the current Regent Rongzeng Daza, while Rear Tibet is Shigatse.</p>
<p>"Rongzeng" is an honorific term for "teacher" in Tibetan. Since Daza seized actual political power in Tibet in April of the 36th year (of the Republic), the monk Yisela of Razheng, a supporter of the former Regent, has been expelled from Tibet, and Pengkang Kalon has also been dismissed. The face of Tibet is now vastly different from the past.</p>
<p>In religion, the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama hold equal status, but in politics, all power is in the hands of the Dalai Lama, and the Panchen Lama can only be considered a local official. The political system of Tibet today can be explained by the following diagram:</p>
<p>The Four Ministers consist of three laymen and one monk. The name of the institution is "Kasha," which is the highest administrative organ in Tibet. Currently, the Four Ministers are: Lhalu Tse Kalon, Gesu Ba Kalon, Sokang Wangqing, and Rampa Lama. During the Qing Dynasty, when a vacancy occurred among the Four Ministers, the Amban (Qing Resident) and the Dalai Lama had to jointly recommend a candidate to the Emperor. Now, the Dalai Lama can resolve the matter with a single order.</p>
<p>The palace officials are similar to the attendants of the imperial court in the mainland. The heads of various departments of the three major monasteries have the same powers as senators. In the event of major events, the secretariat notifies the convening of temporary or regular meetings. The Four Ministers cannot attend the temporary or regular meetings. The Accounting Bureau, Military Affairs Department, Foreign Affairs Bureau, and Agricultural Affairs Bureau each send a representative, and palace officials and personnel from the three major monasteries and various monasteries must all participate. After the discussion concludes, it is submitted to the Dalai Lama for final decision. As for the "Foreign Affairs Bureau" subordinate to the Four Ministers, our highest authority has not yet approved it.</p>
<p>The organization of the Tibetan army is also quite different from that of the mainland. The highest commander is Lhalu Tse Kalon, the General Manager stationed in Qamdo. The name of this authoritative institution is "Majie," which can be said to be the Commander-in-Chief of the Tibetan army. The ranks below are Daiben, Ruben, Jiaben, and Dingben. Each Dingben has only 25 positions, while Daiben have 500 men. Therefore, a Tibetan Daiben is equivalent to a mainland battalion commander.</p>
<p>Our newspaper reporter has learned the following about the current number of troops in Tibet, the names of the commanding officers, and the locations where they are stationed: (See the Brief Table of Current Tibetan Army)</p>
<p>Unit Number | Commanding Officer | Location</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>1st Battalion | Baira Ba Daiben | Lhasa · Shigatse</p>
<p>2nd Battalion | Sokang Lado Daiben | Heihe</p>
<p>| Jingba Daiben | Lhasa</p>
<p>3rd Battalion | Mujia Daiben | Jiangda</p>
<p>| Yemu Dongga Daiben | Zhaya</p>
<p>4th Battalion | Cuoke Daiben | Gyantse · Shigatse</p>
<p>5th Battalion | Originally stationed in Gongjue, Qamdo, now transferred back to Lhasa</p>
<p>6th Battalion | Guotong Ba Daiben | Originally stationed in Seza, now transferred north to the Qinghai border</p>
<p>7th Battalion | Bulong Se Daiben | Leiwuqi (Northern Xikang)</p>
<p>8th Battalion | Xia Baba Daiben | Originally stationed in Jiangka, now transferred to Qamdo</p>
<p>9th Battalion | Datang Dege Se Daiben | Originally stationed in Qamdo, now transferred to Jiangka</p>
<p>10th Battalion | Rongga Bude Daiben | Gyantse · Shigatse</p>
<p>[Note] Each battalion is equipped with machine guns.</p>
<p>The current 14th Dalai Lama is only thirteen years old and is said to have to grow to eighteen years old before he can take charge of political affairs. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Razheng Kalon found the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in the home of a Sinicized Qi family in Qinghai. According to reliable sources known to our newspaper reporter, the fact that the 14th Dalai Lama came from a Sinicized family has led to endless disputes between Razheng Kalon and Rongzeng Daza. Although later Master Ma Yuanhai of Qinghai sent the 14th Dalai Lama to Lhasa to ascend the throne, which seemed to quell the matter, Razheng was eventually poisoned. In addition, the enthronement ceremony alone for the 14th Dalai Lama cost the National Government 400,000 rupees.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, apart from Li Dange Ge-she from Hunan Province in the eighth year of the Republic (Ge-she means Tibetan PhD, Li served as a Supervisory Committee member) leading a "Study Law Delegation" to Lhasa for investigation and research, no second investigation team has entered Tibet to this day. Li Dange Ge-she has long passed away, and Ouyang Zhi, who followed Li Dange in Tibet for eight years, has become the only Han Chinese in the mainland who is proficient in Tibetan affairs and is currently unemployed in the capital. As for the Tibetan commercial representatives currently in Beijing for discussions, it is indeed a first in the Republic of China and has extremely important implications. Delegation member Sokang Lado has always led troops stationed in the Heihe area at the intersection of Kang and Tibet, and is a pivotal figure in the Qinghai, Kang, and Tibetan border region. His father, Sokang Zhaza, is known for being pro-British in Tibet. His eldest son is Sokang Wangqing Kalon, and his son-in-law, Yutuo, is the former General Manager of Qamdo. Another member, Banda Yangbi, with the Han name Luo Shaoting, is proficient in Mandarin and somewhat literate in Chinese. His father, Chongben Yijiang (who was assassinated), was the founder of the Tibetan giant trading house Banda Chang, monopolized Tibet's import and export of wool trade, and served as the General Manager of Yadong in Rear Tibet. The Third Dalai Lama was indeed a prominent figure during his lifetime. (Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)</p>

<h3 id="e131">Post Office Collects Tuition Fees on Behalf of Schools <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Postal Administration has been handling the collection of tuition fees on behalf of schools since the last semester to facilitate the collection of tuition fees for various schools. In the past, many schools entrusted the post office to collect fees on their behalf, which was convenient for both schools and students. As the school year is approaching, the business of collecting tuition fees on behalf of schools will continue to be handled. The post office will start accepting entrustment from today. The methods are recorded as follows: (1) Once a school entrusts the post office to collect fees, the students of the school can pay fees at any post office in the city, without the need to travel far. (2) If the school is outside the urban area but within the Shanghai postal area, the local post offices in the jurisdiction can also collect fees on its behalf. (3) The fee payment forms are to be prepared by the schools themselves. If the post office needs to provide them, please contact us in advance so that we can print them according to the format. (4) The post office will notify the school of the tuition fees collected daily on the following day, so that they can be withdrawn at any time. (5) For other details, please inquire with the Savings and Remittance Business Group of the Administration and the directors of various post offices in the city.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Six Middle Schools Enrolling Students Without Authorization, Municipal Education Bureau Has Banned <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] Recently, various schools have been advertising for enrollment in newspapers. In order to promote government orders and strictly manage private secondary schools, the Municipal Education Bureau has been closely monitoring the enrollment advertisements of various schools published in newspapers. It is learned that the following six schools have been banned by the Municipal Education Bureau for enrolling students without authorization or for misusing the registered wording: Shuguang Middle School in Tangqiao, Pudong; Liangjiang Middle School on Weidema Road in Jiangwan and Daji Road in Ximen; Zhenli Middle School on Yalu River Road in Hongkou; Jingxing Middle School at the entrance of Caoci Lane on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi; Hengmao Middle School in Baxianqiao; and Wudong Middle School in Yangjing.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Home Economics Department of Girls' High School Should Be Improved in Practice, Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to be Notified <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau believes that the establishment of the Home Economics Department for female middle school students was originally intended to improve family life, cultivate domestic skills, and develop work habits and interests. Therefore, operations such as clothing, food, housing, health care, nursing, childcare, gardening, and family management are all important items in junior high school practice. In high school, emphasis is placed on home care (including military care), which is especially important. However, because most students are accustomed to old habits, they often underestimate housework and are unwilling to study seriously. Teachers may only teach from books and fail to strictly supervise practice. Improving home life and fulfilling families are the foundations for social improvement and national construction, and should be given special attention. Therefore, all municipal girls' middle schools and private middle schools in this city, where girls' schools have a Home Economics Department, should make practical improvements. Middle schools with both male and female students must also gather female students and set up a Home Economics Department to meet the needs.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Secretary-General Shen of the Municipal Government gave instructions on the establishment of workers' supplementary schools at the 113th Municipal Administration Meeting, believing that this is a welfare undertaking of the factories for the workers. The Education Bureau can consult with the factories, and the factories are responsible for raising funds, while the teachers are appointed by the Education Bureau.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Education Bureau has recently stipulated the term of employment for teachers and staff of municipal secondary and higher education institutions and ordered all municipal middle schools, municipal junior colleges, municipal vocational schools, and municipal normal schools to be notified. The term of employment for teachers and staff of municipal secondary and higher education institutions is stipulated as one semester for initial appointments and one academic year for renewals. In the future, when schools submit employment contracts for teachers and staff, they should prepare a detailed list stating the "name," "date of arrival," "start and end dates of previous employment," and "start and end dates of current employment." The names of the teachers and staff on the submitted employment contracts should be consistent with the personnel dynamics report. If there are any changes from the previous report form, a copy of the dynamics report should be submitted at the same time, indicating the replacements.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Tuition Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools in Shanghai are About 10% Higher Than Those in Nanjing, Private Highest Fee is About 4 Million, Private Primary Schools 1.5 Million <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] As the start of this semester is approaching, it is reported that the tuition standards for primary and secondary schools in Nanjing for this semester have been passed by the municipal government meeting, stipulating 800,000 for municipal high schools, 700,000 for junior high schools, 3.6 million for private high schools, 3.2 million for junior high schools, 1.1 million for private elementary schools, and 900,000 for primary schools.</p>
<p>Director Li of the Shanghai Education Bureau invited Chen Baotai of the Municipal Party Department, Zhou Feicheng of the Municipal Education Association, Jiang Jizhou of the Private Primary and Secondary Schools Association, etc., to discuss the issue of tuition standards for primary and secondary schools in this city for this semester at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chief Secretary Peng of the Bureau, Chief Xie of the Middle School Division, Section Chief Ye, Chief Zhu of the National Education Division, and others were also present. After exchanging views at the meeting, it was believed that the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai are not far apart, and the cost of living in Shanghai is slightly higher than that in Nanjing. Therefore, the tuition standards for primary and secondary schools in this city are in principle similar to those set by Nanjing, and at most, the figures set by Nanjing will be increased by about 10%. The total amount of fees will increase by about three times compared with the previous semester. Director Li will ask Mayor Wu for instructions in the next few days, and then the official figures can be determined.</p>
<p>Director Li believes that the tuition standards for private primary schools set by Nanjing seem to be too different from those for middle schools. The highest tuition fee for private primary schools in this city this semester is about 1.5 million: the highest tuition fee for private high schools is about 4 million. The fee figures for municipal schools will also be determined and announced in the next few days. The Education Bureau will ban some private schools that have already set tuition figures and charged students.</p>

<h3 id="e138">An Elderly American PhD Serves Our Education, Chairman Chiang Awards Jingxing Medal <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th Airmail] Dr. C. Bertram Rappe came to Sichuan from the United States in January 1909. At that time, Dr. Spencer Lewis was preaching in Zizhong. When he was studying at Northwestern University in Chicago, he became interested in China. He began studying Chinese in 1910, which made it very convenient for him to become the head of Qiujing Middle School in 1912. In the 36 years at the school, he cultivated more than 20,000 outstanding students. Today, Master Yang Chongxi, the principal of Qiujing Middle School, and Dr. Zhang Lingao, the president of Nanjing Jinling University, were his proud disciples in those years.</p>
<p>This 67-year-old slender doctor is unwilling to be lonely; he has reached retirement age, and only returned to China for recuperation for two years after the victory. He and his wife, Ms. Grace, returned to Chongqing together on November 7th last year. His current position is consultant to Qiujing School and director of Kuanren Hospital. He told our reporter: "China is my second hometown, and I want to serve China for another four years." This doctor will not retire until he is 71 years old. According to his current health condition, at that time, he will definitely "serve China for another four years."</p>
<p>Dr. Rappe is a devout Christian. During the Anti-Japanese War, his main work was to preside over the following five relief agencies: (1) United China Relief, (2) American Advisory Committee, (3) International Famine Relief, (4) Committee on Aid to University Faculties, (5) American Red Cross. In addition to the fourth University Relief Committee, he was the accountant for the other four units. He said: During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the American people provided a total of 8.5 million US dollars in aid to China.</p>
<p>Qiujing Middle School was founded in the 17th year of the Guangxu reign. The first principal was Dr. Lewis, and Dr. Rappe was the sixth. The first Chinese principal was Xiao Jiren, and the current principal, Yang Chongxi, is the eighth. Qiujing School includes kindergarten, primary school, middle school, and business school (the business school has been around for eight years and will soon be expanded into a business college). In addition, Dazhou Middle School was also established in Neijiang in the 27th year of the Republic of China. Soon, an agricultural specialized subject will be added, and after the equipment is enriched, it will be changed to an agricultural college until a complete university is established.</p>
<p>February 14th was the greatest glory in the lives of Dr. and Mrs. Zhang Dulun, the mayor of Chongqing, and He Beiheng, the director of the Sichuan Construction Department, presented two Jingxing Medals on behalf of Chairman Chiang. When the reporter asked Rappe what he felt, he replied amiably:</p>
<p>"I really don't have any experience with this kind of thing; too many good friends have asked, and I'm really a little embarrassed." (Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)</p>
<h3 id="e139">Third Shanghai-Hong Kong Football Match, Shanghai Team Loses Again, Hong Kong Western Union Wins 1-0 <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 14th dispatch] In the third Shanghai-Hong Kong football match in Hong Kong, the Shanghai team lost to the Hong Kong Western Union team 1-0 today. The first half was 0-0 with no score.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] On the Lunar New Year's Day, the Hong Kong-Shanghai football match was held at the Happy Valley Stadium. The stands were full of fans. The ticket prices were divided into three types: ten yuan, five yuan, and three and a half yuan, with a total revenue of more than 26,000 yuan. Hong Kong Governor Sir Alexander Grantham presided over the opening kick-off. Before the game, the national anthems of China and the United Kingdom were played, and the atmosphere at the venue was very harmonious. As a result of the battle, the Hong Kong team retained its victory with a score of 5-1. The Hong Kong team also took the lead in the first half with a score of 2-1. In the second half, the Shanghai team lost three goals. The game was not tense. The Hong Kong team overwhelmed the Shanghai team with a transcendent attitude.</p>
<p>Comparing the lineup of the two teams, the Shanghai team should not have lost 5-1, even if they lost. The reason is that the two defenders, Yan and Wu, were out of shape, and Qu Yongfu's defense in the middle was completely ineffective. With these loopholes in the defense, it was impossible to resist the Hong Kong team's attack. On the forward line, the two inside forwards did not run back to the backcourt to get the ball, and the Hong Kong team controlled the entire midfield advantage. Especially in the second half, the entire formation was cut into two sections, and the advance and retreat were out of order, but Zhang Banglun still had an excellent performance. The loss of five goals was beyond human rescue. If Banglun could reduce his fancy showmanship, his future would be limitless. Zhang Jinhai played the best for the Hong Kong team. He and Song Sheng stood in the midfield and completely gained the midfield advantage. The forward, Jiana, was the most popular, and both wings seized opportunities to go deep. Wen Zhi and Yi Jie responded loudly in the middle, forcing the Shanghai team to be beaten passively. From the performance of the whole formation, the Hong Kong team was fast and sharp, while the Shanghai team was slow and chaotic. The methods of communication and cooperation were difficult to compare with the Hong Kong team.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 14th dispatch] The Shanghai International Football Team lost to the Hong Kong Western Union team 1-0 today. The Shanghai team performed well, but unfortunately, the team was not lucky. In the last few minutes, the Shanghai team had four shooting opportunities, but none of them hit the goal. Zhang Banglun was still the best in the Shanghai team in terms of personal technique. The Hong Kong team's goal was scored by right inside forward Keningham. Most opinions believe that this goal should be ruled offside.</p>

<p>In the Group A basketball league, there were originally three matches yesterday, but two teams forfeited, leaving only the Group B Jia Shen versus foreign team Green one. In the first match, Group A Morning White did not have enough players, and Indian won without lifting a finger. However, Morning White has forfeited twice, and according to the rules, their qualification has been revoked, and their past results will not be counted. In the final match of Group A, China United was scheduled to play against the Shantou team. However, the Shantou team telegraphed that they were forfeiting. Thus, China United won with a score of 2-0, achieving eight wins in eight matches and dominating the group.</p>
<p>In the only remaining match, Group B Jia Shen played against foreign team Green. Jia Shen's Tao Ying-shih first broke the ice, but foreign player Xuteh-Gufu missed the penalty shot. Tao scored again, and Liang Hsiung-piao made one out of one free throw, giving Jia Shen a 7-0 lead. Green's Sateh-Gufu and Senna-Gufu both scored, prompting Jia Shen to call a timeout and replace Tao Ying-shih with Wang Chieh-ping. Green became even more demoralized, allowing Jia Shen to dominate. Liang Hsiung-piao, Sun Moses, and Lu Miao-sheng, among others, excelled, and the score increased rapidly. Only after 18-4 did Xuteh-Gufu make two free throws. Before long, the first half ended, with Jia Shen leading 22-7.</p>
<p>After changing sides, Jia Shen replaced Wang Chieh-ping and Yen Shih-fan with Shih Cheng-chung, Niu Yin-mao, and Teh Yin-mao. Green's Senna-Gufu both scored with throws and penalties, adding three points. Then, he made two more free throws. Jia Shen hurriedly put Wang Chieh-ping and Lu Miao-sheng back into the game, replacing Shih and Niu. Taking advantage of the unstable situation, Green launched a major offensive. Although Jia Shen called two timeouts, Liang Hsiung-piao only managed to score one point, allowing the foreign team to close the gap to 22-24. Fortunately, Jia Shen stabilized their play and was not overtaken. After 30-24, Jia Shen became active again, and Green struggled to catch up. By the end of the match, Jia Shen defeated the foreign team with a score of 47-28, achieving five wins in five matches. With only two matches left against Tung Wah and Central Air Transport, they can complete their dominance. The Group B championship is firmly in their grasp.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] All industries resumed trading yesterday after the Spring Festival holiday. A bull market opened, with prices generally rising. The market's money supply is very stable. A total of 29,453 checks were cleared, with a total amount of 1,439,916,017,000 yuan. The four banks and two bureaus experienced a difference of 85.4 billion yuan, due to the frequent turnover of chips in bull market trading for various industries.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The North-South rice market resumed trading yesterday. Under close scrutiny from all parties, a bull market opened. Rice merchants mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market was stable with few transactions. The Bureau of Social Affairs originally planned to sell 100,000 dan of rice on the market, but refrained from doing so.</p>
<p>Rice Yesterday's registered arrivals at the South Market were 1,599 shi, and at the North Market, 2,219 and a half shi.

Yanghsien was priced at 1.75 million yuan, and special grade japonica was priced at 1.77 million yuan in the South Market and 1.78 million yuan in the North Market. None of these prices exceeded last year's closing prices.</p>
<p>Grains Flour prices rose sharply at the opening but retreated quickly before closing. High-priced transactions were canceled, resulting in a net increase of over 10,000 yuan. Bran initially rose but then fell, with a slight increase of over 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake owners were firm, and Shantou welcomed inquiries, resulting in a sharp increase of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans varied, with northern demand being acceptable but local demand being flat. Duhuang rose slightly by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and Hankou yellow soybeans showed slight strength. Customer soybeans soared by 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Broad beans saw low supply and demand, with a price increase of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Mung beans saw activity in the northern markets, rising another 1 million yuan. Sorghum saw little activity, with a steady increase of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Corn in Qingdao continued to be in high demand, soaring by over 1 million yuan, but easing at the close.</p>
<p>Raw peanuts were being purchased by the Guangdong merchants, leading to rising prices, soaring by 2 million yuan. Sesame in Tianjin was being targeted, with high local demand and limited supply, leading to a rapid surge of 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Oil market sentiment remained strong, with all oils rising successively by 1 million to 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened with a bull market. Due to positive news, customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions were actively purchasing. Local traders also showed interest. Although factories slightly increased sales, demand exceeded supply, causing prices to rise frequently. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn soared by 5 million yuan compared to before the holiday, reaching 65.5 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose sharply, ranging from 2 million to 5 million or 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market experienced bull market trading for the new year. People were generally optimistic, and local traders were eager to cover their positions. Traders from the north also made some purchases, and retail investors also absorbed a large amount. Prices rose sharply due to the surge in the yarn market. Later, after 10:00 AM, the Textile Construction Company offered a large supply, causing prices to fall slightly. However, the prices of 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloths still soared by 150,000 to 120,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. The prices of other cloths also rose across the board.</p>
<p>Silk The artificial silk market saw a slight increase yesterday. 120-count Asahi silk opened at 98 million yuan and closed at around 8.5 million yuan at noon. However, due to the silk factories not having resumed work, there was no demand, resulting in very little trading. In the afternoon, it was offered at 8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory silk remained closed yesterday. Due to low buying and selling activity, although there was a desire to sell, there were no buyers. Although one or two parties were interested in purchasing, the prices were harsh, resulting in no trading outside the market.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics The silk fabric market rose yesterday. China Strong True Silk quilt covers opened at 43.1 million yuan for immediate delivery and 43.7 million yuan for Monday delivery. Great Honesty goods were 200,000 yuan higher, and American Asian goods were 300,000 yuan higher than Great Honesty goods. Due to very little trading, closing prices remained unchanged. Great Honesty checkered crepe was 185,000 yuan. The factory prices of other goods were mostly not yet released.</p>
<p>Sugar Taiwan Sugar started selling on the 12th, with prices increasing by 60,000 yuan and quotas remaining unchanged. As for the association's allocation, trading officially started yesterday, with most prices rising by about 10%. However, medium sugar was weaker.

<p>Tea Tea prices were chaotic yesterday, with little actual trading. Due to it being the weekend, there was very little buying and selling. According to general opinion, expectations for the new year's bull market were high due to the scarcity of goods.</p>
<p>Timber Timber prices for the new year saw foreign pine rise by 15% compared to last year, and fir rose by 10%. Judging from the market conditions, the opening prices were stable.</p>

<p>If Errors are Found in Operations, Inspectors Should Correct Them Immediately</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that, in order to enhance the efficiency of bank operation inspections, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated a regulation regarding matters that inspectors should supervise and rectify when inspecting banks. The regulation requires that if there are errors in the operational management and accounting processing techniques of various banks, money shops, and firms, the original inspectors should supervise the inspected entities to rectify and report them promptly in order to achieve timely results. However, since its implementation, many inspectors have proceeded with inspections, but many have also failed to effectively supervise and urge rectification. The National Bank has been instructed to refer to the previous case and implement it thoroughly. It is reported that the Audit Department of the National Bank has already issued a circular to its branches, instructing inspectors to comply with it thoroughly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The quantity of Taiwan sugar to be shipped to Japan has long been decided to be 25,000 tons, and the price is US$200 per ton, to be delivered in three batches. The contract has long been signed, and the only unresolved issue is transportation. It is reported that our side, due to the insistence of General MacArthur's headquarters, has agreed to use Japanese vessels for transportation, with a freight rate of US$6.75 per ton.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 14th] In order to increase the northern coal transported to the south, the authorities have decided to use Xin Port for loading. Coal from Mentougou and Kailuan has arrived at Xin Port in large quantities. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiguang Wheel arrived in port on the 11th to take over the transport. On the 12th, the port used its own generated electricity to operate its automatic coal loading machine, loading 1,500 tons of coal in seven hours. The vessel left port on the 12th and sailed to Shanghai. The Yanguan, Huaqiang, and other vessels are en route to the port.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] In order to alleviate the cost burden on commercial banks and firms, the Central Bank has decided to appropriately increase the interest rate on deposit reserves. It was previously changed from a weekly interest of two points to be calculated according to the approved lending and deposit interest rates, approximately around a weekly interest of four points. Now, because the industry still feels that it is insufficient to compensate for losses, it has been decided, after considering the actual situation, to uniformly calculate it at a weekly interest of five points. In addition, the fixed-term deposits for the same industry offered by the bank were originally set at a monthly interest of eight points. Now, in order to adapt to the needs of the industry due to the high hidden interest rates in the market, it has been changed to one corner and two points. The unit amount of the deposit remains at 100 million yuan, and the term remains at seven days. As for the interest on current deposits for the same industry, it has also been increased from eight li to one point and two li.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Transportation Control Committee previously announced that the 60-day deadline for applying for re-export of wool arriving at the port with foreign exchange but without a permit, expired on February 9th of this year.

<p>For daily necessities, the soap market soared because manufacturers had not yet announced dispatch news, and sales at door shops were extremely brisk. Traders were actively purchasing, and it was also heard that raw materials were in short supply. With new purchases active, the prices of various goods reached new highs.

<p>The city's jewelry industry has been closed for a long time. Now, because the Bureau of Social Affairs has approved 146 stores to operate, they have all partially reopened yesterday. For the time being, they are limited to exchanging old gold jewelry for new gold jewelry, with an additional fee of 500,000 yuan per tael. The labor cost varies depending on the fineness of the jewelry, ranging from 200,000 yuan to 1 million yuan per tael. As for the sale of new jewelry, the authorities have not yet made a specific decision on labor costs and other items, and the jewelry stores are still temporarily not selling. The Financial Management Bureau attaches great importance to the reopening of jewelry stores and has decided to continue its efforts to crack down on the black market for gold.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Fish Market Sales Stagnant, Prices Drop by 30% with No Buyers <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>During the old lunar new year, the city's fishing boats surged in, including 13 fishing boats from the Fishing Management Office and six pairs of fishing boats from various private companies, fully loaded with fresh fish, totaling more than 20,000 boxes, docked at the fishing market wharf, waiting to be unloaded.</p>
<p>The market was closed for two days as usual for the spring festival. It opened for trading early the day before yesterday (the 12th). However, because restaurants and canteens had not yet reopened after the old lunar new year, and the general public had already prepared plenty of new year goods and did not need to buy more, only over 3,000 boxes were sold, and the price dropped by about 30% compared to during the year. Even the fish vendors were hesitant to buy.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 14th) afternoon, the market specially invited the responsible persons of various fishing boat companies to discuss the matter. As a result, in addition to the market still trying to promote sales as much as possible, the Fishing Management Office and China Aquatic Products Company decided to first deliver a portion of the fish, about 3,000 boxes, to the fishing market's first refrigeration plant for cold storage, in order to adjust the supply.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Major Investors Act Decisively; Chinese Stocks Continue to Advance <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were still performing well yesterday, encouraged by the money supply. Namely, Yongshas had more purchases than sales. After a long period of brewing, major investors in the industry acted decisively and boosted it. The stock suddenly became very popular at the close. Small-cap stocks such as Xinguang also showed signs of standing out. Unless there are special setbacks in the future, there is still a possibility of higher prices.</p>
<p>In the early morning, there was some hesitation due to reports that the cotton inventory had to be purchased by the Textile Construction Company and that unapproved interphones were being investigated. At the opening, both glory and shame were seen. Wuhe, due to a notice of traffic congestion, was temporarily suspended from trading in the afternoon, and even went up in a falling posture. Xinyi and Hengfeng were also involved, but did not trade. Yongsha debuted at prices of 744 yuan and 760 yuan, which was quite mediocre. After opening, with the support of bull market trading, it rose from 743 yuan and 760 yuan, advanced by 89, 71, and 65 into instant delivery, 134, 22, 71, and 105 advanced into deferred delivery, rising to 762 yuan and 774 yuan. 84 and 68 settled current delivery, the price fell to 752 yuan and 764 yuan, 35 and 89 advanced instant delivery, 134, 180, 76, and 105 advanced deferred delivery, rising to 764 yuan and 782 yuan. The external interest rate still opened at three corners, one and a half cents, and three corners, six cents. With the addition of the increased telephone inspection, 71, 183, 97, 157, and 125 all sold instant delivery, 99 also settled, retreating to 757 yuan and 772 yuan. However, 71, 134, 207, 16, 89, 4, 202, 190, 173, and 104 purchased instant delivery in succession. 36 came in after going out, and 105 and 232 advanced deferred delivery. Near noon, it rose to a high price of 776 yuan and 793 yuan, and then closed at 774 yuan and 791 yuan. Xinguang had a large number of buyers, as did Tongyi, which quickly caught up and made progress. As a result, compared to the previous close, instant delivery stocks Yongsha, Xinhe, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Meiya, and Xinguang each rose by about half a percent. Zhongni, Hengfeng, Lian, Shangping, and Wuhe returned after falling to the limit, rising slightly. The rest rose slightly. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Yongsha rose by slightly less than half a percent, and the rest rose slightly. Among the unlisted stocks outside the market, except for Dasheng, which continued to decline slightly, the rest were still mediocre.</p>
<p>Government bonds generally fell back yesterday. Tongbing opened at 82,000 in the morning and ended at 74,000 after reaching 86,000. Rooms 360 and 555 bought, while rooms 500 and 552 sold. Room 503 went out and then came in. The turnover was still only about 1 million. Compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi fell by 7,000 yuan, Tongbing fell by 11,000, Dingzhong fell by a little less than 8,000 yuan, and Tongwu fell by 9,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks had few transactions yesterday, and the trend was still towards prosperity. Yisha rose to 660,000 after opening at 620,000, then retreated slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha, British Allied, Yeguang, Paper Edition Shipping, and Steel all rose slightly. Huizong fell slightly, and Yipi rose by about half a percent. Miscellaneous stocks had no bids.</p>

<h3 id="e164">New Year's Message <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Jiwan</p>
<p>Dietary Moderation and Hygiene</p>
<p>The importance of dietary hygiene has been known since ancient times. The Inner Canon states, "Eat and drink with moderation, live with regularity, and do not work recklessly. Therefore, the body and spirit can be united, and one can live out their natural lifespan." Another saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth." Therefore, apart from external infections, the number of diseases caused by diet should not be small.</p>
<p>It is now the new year, and according to customs, we first have the "New Year's Eve dinner" at the end of the year, and then the "Spring Wine" at the beginning of the year. Relatives and friends invite each other, and there are frequent banquets. There are no empty evenings, and stir-fries, roasts, and braised dishes are all mixed together. At first, one can indulge in these feasts, but after many banquets, even with a full table of delicacies, one may feel dry-mouthed and tasteless, and respectfully decline.</p>
<p>The capacity of the human stomach is ultimately limited. How can it withstand greasy and viscous foods, refusing nothing? When the stomach is full and digestion is difficult, few people will not suffer from food poisoning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is customary for Chinese people, regardless of their usual circumstances, to cook a large amount of food during the New Year to prepare for a large feast. Some even store more than half a month's worth of delicacies. If this is not enough to flaunt their wealth, then what is? But consider that if food is left for too long, all the nutrients will be lost, or the taste will become sour and spoiled. Eating it is harmful to hygiene, and abandoning it is a waste of resources. Why not prepare a smaller amount and add fresh vegetables at any time? Wouldn't that be best of both worlds?</p>
<p>I strongly advocate that during this time of frugality, it is not necessary to visit each other frequently. Instead, we can promote group meals once or twice. Not only is it not wasteful, but it is also greatly beneficial to hygiene. What do health experts think of this?</p>
<h3 id="e165">Women's Abdominal Pain <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhongli</p>
<p>Reflections on Ovary Removal</p>
<p>Abdominal pain in women is an extremely common ailment. Since publishing an article on this, numerous patients have sought consultation. Although it cannot be said that all were completely cured, the prescriptions provided often led to pain relief and regular menstruation. This is a helpful insight. Consequently, the differences in treatment between Chinese and Western medicine, as well as the effectiveness and positive/negative consequences, are beneficial for patients in clarifying diagnoses and ensuring safe treatment. I will discuss these in detail to benefit readers.</p>
<p>'Daily Abdominal Pain': The pain has no fixed time. The most obvious symptom is pain in one or both sides of the lower abdomen, such as on the upper thigh or in the iliac fossa, with a hardened mass. It is painful to the touch and may even form a palpable mass, accompanied by lower back pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination. Some cases are due to injury from abortions. Western medicine diagnoses these as fallopian tube inflammation, fallopian tube hernia pain, or fallopian tube abscesses. Oral administration of blood-activating, qi-regulating, and stasis-resolving remedies often results in a cure.</p>
<p>'Menstrual Abdominal Pain': Menstrual abdominal pain is called dysmenorrhea. It can occur before, after, or during menstruation, or even in the middle of the menstrual cycle. The pain is located in the center of the lower abdomen or moves from side to side, sometimes even resisting touch. Breast distension indicates stagnation of liver and spleen qi and blood stasis in the uterus. Western medicine diagnoses these as uterine inflammation. If the pain is localized to one side, either left or right, it is often due to imbalance of the penetrating and conception vessels and blockage of the collaterals. Western medicine diagnoses these as ovarian inflammation, sometimes accompanied by fallopian tube inflammation. The treatment method is similar and should focus on activating blood, regulating qi, and using menstrual-regulating medications.</p>
<p>In summary, for both types of abdominal pain, treatment should emphasize blood-activating and pain-relieving remedies. I often prescribe medications that directly target the uterus, such as amethyst, Trogopterus dung, Vaccaria seed, and tangerine seed, which are particularly effective. According to patients, Western medicine sometimes recommends removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes, initially removing one. However, based on my clinical experience, unless the diagnosis is confirmed to be a tumor, pain often persists on the left side even after the right ovary is removed. However, administering decoctions to clear stasis and regulate qi often leads to a cure, and the patient can maintain their original health and fertility. Oral administration of penetrating-vessel-activating and meridian-invigorating remedies is similar to the Western medical method of clearing the fallopian tubes. Therefore, the reflection on ovary removal may not necessarily be good. This is a factual observation. The goal of treatment is to maintain health, and cautious surgical implementation applies to both Chinese and Western medicine. However, clear diagnosis and whether to use oral decoctions or surgery should not be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="e166">External Symptoms in the Neck <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Renkang</p>
<p>The neck contains lymph nodes (called Shao Yang meridian in Chinese medicine), and below that, the thyroid gland. Lymph nodes are crucial for defending the body against pathogens. They are located at critical points. Mild cases lead to elimination of pathogens, while severe cases lead to accumulation and stagnation, forming swollen nodules. Furthermore, the resulting symptoms vary depending on the type of pathogen. Careful differentiation and treatment are necessary.</p>
<p>[Wind-Phlegm] [Monkey-Phlegm]: Wind-phlegm originates in the neck, while monkey-phlegm develops under the chin. It starts as a single nodule, the size of a walnut, white and not very red, with some pain. It usually suppurates within one to two weeks and is relatively easy to cure.</p>
<p>[Cheek Ringworm] [Neck Ringworm] [Ear Root Ringworm]: Cheek ringworm starts on both cheeks, neck ringworm in the neck, and ear root ringworm under the ear. Initially, there is redness and swelling, and the pain is severe, accompanied by chills and fever. If it does not resolve, it will suppurate within seven to ten days. Early treatment of the above conditions can often resolve them, and even if pus forms, they are relatively easy to cure and are considered mild conditions.</p>
<p>[Scrofula]: Also known as "rat neck." Nodules appear in the neck, one or more, without any pain. Improper treatment often leads to ulceration and drainage of yellow fluid after many months or years. This condition requires patient treatment and adequate nutrition. Even if ulceration has occurred, there is still hope for a cure. Inquiries for treatment are welcome.</p>
<p>[Consumption Failure]: Relatively rare and occurs in people over forty. It is actually a malignant lymphoma or tuberculosis. It also develops in the neck and is hard like iron. Over time, it ulcerates, and the sores are concave and convex, discharging bloody fluid, leading to a hopeless situation. This is the most serious of neck disorders.</p>
<p>[Goiter]: Commonly known as "thick neck." It is actually a swelling caused by excessive thyroid gland development and abnormal secretion. The neck gradually enlarges, resembling a hanging gourd, and may fluctuate with mood. Treatment is usually ineffective, but it does not endanger life.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cough <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Guoshu</p>
<p>I suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis for three years in my early years. In addition to artificial pneumothorax, I tried all kinds of Chinese and Western medicines. I believe that nutritional therapy can indeed help strengthen the body and enhance resistance, unconsciously eliminating tuberculosis. At the very least, it can promote the proliferation of connective tissue around the lesions, surrounding the tuberculosis bacteria and depriving them of their survival conditions, gradually leading to their elimination. Now, I will list the main symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis and corresponding medications, so that those suffering from this disease will know what to choose.</p>
<p>'Cough': Cough is a reflex symptom and should not be suppressed. The focus should be on moistening the lungs, which means calming the lung lobes. Medications include Adenophora stricta, Ophiopogon japonicus, bird's nest, lung dew, and pear juice. For those with phlegm, add phlegm-resolving ingredients such as apricot kernel, Fritillaria cirrhosa, clam powder, Polygala tenuifolia, and Platycodon grandiflorus.</p>
<p>'Hemoptysis': Hemoptysis is related to cough. Coughing causes lung vibration, making blood vessels prone to rupture, resulting in hemoptysis. If the cough persists after hemoptysis, the rupture is difficult to heal. Hemoptysis can easily increase fever, worsening the condition and weakening the body. Hemoptysis in pulmonary tuberculosis is often caused by coughing, with bright red blood and bubbles, which is very different from stomach blood, which is dark purple and mixed with food residue. Medications include ten ash pill, Panax notoginseng powder, Rehmannia glutinosa, Asini Corii Colla, Biota orientalis leaf, Agrimonia pilosa, lotus root node, and Fabae semen flos.</p>
<p>'Tidal Fever': If pulmonary tuberculosis cough is accompanied by tidal fever, the condition is serious. High and continuous fever indicates a critical condition, severely depleting body fluids. Medications include Lycii radicis cortex, Artemisia annua, Paeonia suffruticosa cortex, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, and Eupolyphaga seu Steleophaga.</p>
<p>'Night Sweats': Night sweats are often accompanied by steaming bone fever and tidal fever. However, steaming bone fever does not diminish with night sweats, and persistent night sweats further weaken the body, promoting fever increase. Medications include dried persimmon calyx, wheat bran, Glycine sojae semen testa, and oyster shell.</p>

<h3 id="e170">On Chinese and Western Writing <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>In his article "Sighs of Disaster" in this newspaper on the 8th, Mr. Jingwen discussed fundraising in China, stating, "As a Chinese commoner, how much disaster relief donation (direct or indirect) one has to bear in a year is probably something no one can calculate." He also stated, "Indeed, because society is a collective group, and humans have a responsibility to help each other, the form of fundraising does not necessarily reflect the meaning of disaster. For example, in European and American societies, in addition to charitable fundraising for religious causes, academic and cultural fundraising are also very common… However, the fundraising over there is mostly constructive and full of hope. An academic organization is created from donations, a university is maintained by donations…”</p>
<p>This argument is quite correct. We see and hear too many negative and destructive things every day, and we cannot but admit that positive and constructive things are scarce. To illustrate this, one only needs to look around to understand, no need for examples to be clear. I remember a fable in the Collected Works of Ice-Drinking Studio. The gist is: an official died, and the King of Hell wanted to punish him. The official claimed that he had been honest and incorruptible in the human world and had not defrauded the people of a single coin. The King of Hell told him: Being an honest official is your duty. You are being punished because you did not have good political achievements. If being an official only required honesty, then the stone lion in front of the courtyard, which drinks no water, would be much more honest than you!</p>
<p>Liang Rengong's words emphasize the effectiveness of governance and have a Western flavor, not entirely a Chinese perspective. In our common biographies, for all who have been officials, there are always these two sentences: "An honest and upright official with remarkable political achievements." The so-called "remarkable political achievements" are nothing more than "an honest and upright official." In the past, Chinese officials were content with not being harsh or disturbing the people. Once they retired, the people under their governance would always be reluctant to let them go, kneeling on the ground to see them off at the ten-mile pavilion. This shows how easy it was to be an official in our country and how content the people were. I remember a certain legal authority in the country told his students: When you go out to be officials in the future, it would be great if you were a little more content than other officials. It would be very good if you didn't do bad things. These words were actually born of profound experience and were a kind of helpless statement.</p>
<p>Chinese people lean towards negativity, while Europeans and Americans lean towards positivity. This can be seen most clearly in Chinese and Western writings. I had not paid attention to this before. A friend of mine was recuperating in a deep mountain temple, reading Chinese and Western books while sick. Because the environment was quiet and his heart was clear, he saw a difference between Chinese and Western writings. He wrote to me saying: "...Reading Western magazines and articles, I often find works that inspire ambition and delight the mind. The best of our country's writings are full of killing intent, and the inferior ones are about women and money. This is the result of the chaos in the country, and the resentment can also be a source of future chaos..." After that, I paid more attention to the writing style of foreign articles and felt that my friend was right. Western articles always express optimism between the lines and seem to have a way to solve problems. They don't make a fuss over nothing and have the image of the rising sun in the sky and sunlight on the ground, which is comfortable to read. Even expository and revealing texts seem to be relatively calm and peaceful, with little arrogance or eccentricity. They always specifically point out the inappropriate parts, describe the source of the disease in an orderly manner, actively propose solutions, and then optimistically express that the problem can be satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>Most of our current articles are empty and irrelevant. As for critical texts, their intention to destroy is greater than their intention to establish, often causing a dark, terrifying, and unpleasant feeling. Some attack the current situation in a sweeping manner, expressing complete dissatisfaction with it. Where is the current situation bad? No specific points are made. What can be done to solve it? No constructive methods are proposed. It seems that they are just expressing that the patient has a third- or fourth-stage lung disease and is absolutely incurable. Some, however, adopt a vague method, either attacking from the side, or going around in circles, or making long detours, or pointing at the mulberry tree and scolding the locust. As a result, writing has mostly lost its spirit of neutrality and peace and has lost its grand and imposing image. Apart from personal venting, what good does this kind of writing do? Still others adopt a method of escaping reality or covering up the truth. When it comes to a critical point, the article ends sorrowfully and changes the topic. Therefore, no matter how much you say, it always feels like you are not hitting the nail on the head, as if you have drawn a dragon but not bothered to dot the eyes. This phenomenon is not unrelated to the current environment, but what I don't understand is why they must write this kind of article that dares not be sincere? If they don't write it, can't they reduce the reader's revulsion a little?</p>
<p>I always feel that this kind of article lacks sunshine and is an unhealthy state. Although it may be said that it is due to the oppressive environment, I am afraid that this is not entirely the case. You only need to read our country's poetry to know that there is very little optimism, and most of them are always gloomy, melancholic, and sentimental. It is either complaining or mourning, either sadness in autumn or mourning for the dead. Why can't we sing more praises of spring and always be so dull?</p>
<p>I am not advocating singing praises or embellishing the present. I am only saying that sighing and complaining, full of sorrow, and only thinking about the bad is not a way to solve problems. Whether in writing or in spirit, we must first have an optimistic, enterprising, and constructive heart, and then we can hope to achieve the goal of construction.</p>
<h3 id="e171">"God" <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yuechu</p>
<p>"God" is just an "image" of man.</p>
<p>"People" have great differences, and "Gods" also have great differences.</p>
<p>Western "Gods" are just "people" who are relatively beautiful or strong. They have joys, sorrows, love, and war, they live among "people", and they also die.</p>
<p>Eastern "Gods" are detached from the "people" of society, they have no emotional fluctuations, they live in heaven, and they never die.</p>
<p>Human beings are all peace-loving, so eliminating violence and maintaining peace is often the responsibility of Gods, whether Eastern or Western, it is all the same; however, in the process of punishing evil, Western Gods rely on their wit and courage; Eastern Gods rely on "magic treasures" and spells. In other words: the power of Western Gods has its limits, while the Eastern Gods are omnipotent.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance: Western Gods, men are strong and powerful, women are young and beautiful; but Eastern Gods, mostly men are old men with immortal demeanor and gradually white whiskers, women are fragile young ladies.</p>
<p>From the difference of "Gods", we can deduce the difference of "People".</p>
<h3 id="e172">Duty <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Bu Nuan</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese presented the Twenty-One Demands, threatening Yuan Shikai. The whole country was indignant, and the Chinese students studying in the United States also organized and advocated declaring war on Japan. Letters and telegrams were exchanged, and they were very generous. Only Hu Shih at that time maintained calmness, advocated ethical resistance, and did not make meaningless sacrifices. He wrote an English letter to the "Chinese Students in America," and his important words were:</p>
<p>"I think that at present, students should be calm and complete our duty to study. We must study for the future construction of our motherland. The future of the motherland will definitely need us!"</p>
<p>We dare not make any judgments about what the situation was like at that time. Hu Shih was greatly criticized at that time, and many people even wrote letters scolding him and specifically stated that he should not be elected during the election. We know that under the abnormal psychology of the masses, sometimes it is difficult to speak. This shows that Ibsen's grumbling is not meaningless, "The majority is always wrong, and the minority is right." Here, we do not deny the usefulness of excitement and generosity. For example, the May Fourth Movement and the July 7th Resistance War emotions erupted at the time and could not be stopped no matter what. The ancients called it "If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?" That is the truth. However, we must always admit that this phenomenon is very unusual and not normal. One person's emotions cannot be in a state of madness for a long time, and a country or a community does not want to be agitated all the time. We must know that the impact of a wave is often not temporary, and the merits and demerits must be judged in decades, hundreds, or even thousands of years - sometimes, it is simply never clear.</p>
<p>Not just myself, but for most people, what they are seeking and hoping for is "peace"? Lao Tzu's small country with few people was in response to the warring states period of fighting for cities and land. Mozi's universal love and non-aggression was in response to killing fields. These are all diagnoses and treatments for the disease, so it is inevitable that the words are excessive; that is, the correction is always overcorrected. The Confucian school put forward the creeds of benevolence and righteousness, and also said, "Live in your position and act," "If you are not in that position, do not plan its affairs," and so on. The meaning here is not to stand by and do nothing, not to take responsibility, but to express that a citizen has his own duty, and should not act rashly, nor should he not act. Thinking about it carefully, although human society claims to be organized and in order, since the relationship is built on "ruling" and "subordination", the way to maintain it is very problematic. Not only "the gates of the princes, benevolence and righteousness are in them," but who doesn't look at the emperor with envy? A gangster becomes an emperor, and Shusun Tong leads a group of literati to practice court etiquette. This is inevitably a tragedy, but it is inferred that the reason why gangsters became emperors is actually because the literati or the general public failed to fulfill their duties. If the division of labor in society is very clear and the rights and obligations are fair and reasonable, then why do wars arise, and bloodshed is even more unnecessary. But what is said about the division of labor and rights and obligations is a matter that will never be clear, and it cannot but be blamed on the confused intellectuals.</p>
<p>People often lament the large number of illiterates in China, but some people say sarcastically: "There should be fewer scholars, look, it is these guys who do bad things! 100% of the uneducated people are authentic good people." This makes us blush. Who is responsible for corruption, perversion of the law, and treason? It is the common people who pay this debt, so the common people are unfairly treated there. Why are the intellectuals so bad? You can of course simply and clearly tell me: "The problem of life." In fact, this is not entirely the case. Not only are some corrupt people rich, but even when life was easier to maintain in the past, there were still many who scraped the land. In my opinion, this is just a "restless" psychology at work. The first is being restless about life. They don't produce as much as others, but they want to enjoy as much consumption as others. Therefore, although we can't even cast steel rails, there were not few cars in 1948. Society calls this enjoyment being trendy, and the height of money is used to measure personality. How can the atmosphere be good? The second is being restless about duty, which is divided into two types, one is purely duty, and the other is the morality of service. Appointed officials envy recommended officials, and recommended officials covet specially simplified officials. What they admire is nothing more than being able to have more money and power, and not to fulfill greater responsibilities; as for morality, I probably don't need to mention it, you can all understand it. The ancients took each living in peace as the minimum condition for governing the country, but now everyone is restless. Real life and psychology are all a word of delusion. Suffering is suffering in vain, and enjoyment is even more outrageous, but it is inevitable that the pedantic theory of doing their best to guard their duty will be ridiculed by revolutionaries, which is really impossible!</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Bridge of Chinese and Western Music <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>I believe that the achievement of the Central Broadcasting Orchestra is not what is generally believed to be "promoting national quintessence," but it is doing "the bridge of Chinese and Western music." In simple terms, it is to gradually let the audience who can only appreciate Chinese music understand Western music.</p>
<p>Most Chinese people have cursed Western music. When the former Municipal Council Orchestra (now the Municipal Symphony Orchestra) first performed in Shanghai, the Chinese called it "wasp calling." Their hearing would easily erase the three-dimensional interlaced beauty of "flowing architecture" in Western music - the highest realm of modern music art, which is not found in Chinese music.</p>
<p>Now, the Broadcasting Orchestra uses a weekly method to persuade those who hate modern music. This method is: referring to the form of a Western orchestra, using Chinese instruments to form a Chinese Orchestra, for example: the string part includes high-pitched erhu, middle-pitched erhu and low-pitched erhu, which are exactly equivalent to the violin, viola and cello in the Western orchestra; in terms of music, the symphony form of Western music is used as the form; first there is a theme, and then it is developed, and the whole song is divided into four movements, but the spirit (flavor) of the music is still oriental. For example, the song "Sugar Seller" (performed at the Shanghai Jin Cheng Theater on the 6th), first uses a piccolo to play the theme, and then other instruments respond and change, describing the story of a sugar seller with a child theme, which is similar to "descriptive music" in Western music. Another example is the song "Ling Shan Vatican Sound", which also completely imitates the form of a symphony, using the slow, medium, fast, and rapid tempos in sequence, and the use of "harmony", "counterpoint", and the wonderful use of musical language to imply the omnipotence of the Buddha, which is exactly "program music" in Western music.</p>
<p>In addition, the adoption of the conductor system, the staff notation method, and other playing skills all come from Western music. On the surface, the Broadcasting Orchestra is an incarnation of the Western symphony orchestra, but the number of instruments is less, the instruments themselves are still "Chinese", and the content of the music is Chinese.</p>
<p>However, the audience will never think that this is Western music, and they feel that this more complex Chinese music is indeed more interesting than the original Chinese music. Therefore, they feel the primitiveness and backwardness of the original Chinese music. The so-called "ancient elegant music" can only occasionally satisfy the emotion of "reminiscing about the past", and its essence is anti-progressive.</p>
<p>This effect of "improving national music" is to introduce and explain the value of Western music. After accepting this kind of national music, the audience will naturally gradually understand the three-dimensional beauty of modern music and will not be as arbitrary as before. Therefore, we will generally accept using modern progressive instruments and progressive methods to express our national music, and not necessarily discuss nationality with instruments.</p>
<p>In the incident of the eleven-hole new flute (created by the Academia Sinica) adopted by the Broadcasting Orchestra, we are told two more things: first, this new flute has complete semitones, free transposition, and complete emotional expression, which can be used for ensemble. It is enough to prove that the original six-hole flute is incomplete and unreasonable, and there is no need to strengthen the defense. Second, although this flute is similar to the Western flute, it has no opening and closing device, which is inconvenient to play; it is enough to prove that the improvement of Chinese instruments to the extreme is at most equal to Western music. In fact, this is the case in all improved Chinese musical instruments. This is because these primitive musical instruments are mostly the distant ancestors of modern musical instruments. Musical instruments only have the difference between progress and no progress, and there is no distinction between nationality.</p>
<p>The future of Chinese new music is very clear: it is to accept the methods and instruments of Western music while retaining its inherent national characteristics. The Central Broadcasting Orchestra is using Chinese instruments to educate people to understand the methods and values of Western music. This work is worthy of praise.</p>

<p>A Jew who was exiled from Germany to the Soviet Union walked with his son past Lenin's tomb. The son asked him who Lenin was. He said, "Lenin? He is the one who liberated us from the chains! Do you remember? Mother's gold chain and my heavy gold watch chain?"</p>
<h3 id="e175">The豫 Opera of Lanzhou (Part 1) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Junzuo</p>
<p>Outside the Shuangcheng Gate of Lanzhou can be said to be the only entertainment venue for the common people. There are various storytelling venues and local theaters. Among them, there is a豫 opera theater that sings Henan opera, called the Zhongzhou Theater, and its business is particularly good.</p>
<p>Last autumn, I listened to a Henan opera. I was a bit uncomfortable with a theater covered with a low reed mat and a stage full of beggar-like costumes. I didn't expect to endure until the last play, and it seemed like a fresh flower suddenly emerged from the desert. There was a female actress who, although not necessarily beautiful, had truly reached the pinnacle of perfection in her singing and performance. This actress is named Song Shuyun, and she was originally a famous star in豫 opera.</p>
<p>It is said that although a Henan troupe's box office is booming, it is still losing money and is not easy to sustain. Friends in the cultural circles of Lanzhou (including me), firstly, knew that some people have been engaged in the movement to improve豫 opera in recent years, and secondly, felt that there are still some talents in豫 opera, especially female actors. Shanghai can innovate Yue opera, so why can't Lanzhou improve豫 opera? As a result of exchanging opinions in several cultural conferences, it was decided to try this approach. It happened that the Northwest Military and Political Headquarters News Department had this intention. The News Department has a sound drama team, and it might as well control a local theater group to serve as a sharp tool for promoting national culture. The time was gradually ripening.</p>
<p>More than two months after I left Lanzhou, I returned to this ancient city of ice and snow! When I stepped into the豫 opera theater again, I was very pleased to see that the theater was actively developing its work under the guidance of the News Department of the Military and Political Headquarters and had changed its name to Xinguang豫 Opera Theater. Although it was still the reed mat shed, it had been decorated, the order in the theater was better than before, the beggar costumes were no longer seen, and the red actresses flaunted brand-new costumes, and the general actors were also much more tidy. Henan opera, or Zhongzhou opera, is now very popular in Lanzhou, overwhelming all local operas (Qin腔, Jin腔, Ping opera) and Beijing opera. It only performs one night show every day, and every show is sold out.</p>
<p>In Lanzhou society, in recent months, whether officials and dignitaries, literati and scholars, peddlers, wives, and young ladies, almost everyone has regarded豫 opera as an excellent topic of conversation, especially the two great Kun actors of豫 opera—Song Shuyun and Wang Jingyun—are praised to the skies, and they are invisibly divided into Song and Wang parties. Several newspapers exaggerate it even more, and it is very lively. As a result, the general public's interest in豫 opera has increased, and the theater's doors have been broken several times.</p>
<p>In this way, a wave of artistic criticism has risen. How to reform豫 opera into a modern drama has become the theme of today's drama lovers in Lanzhou. In Shanghai, the local opera Yue opera is popular, but it seems that no one mentions豫 opera? But I dare to assert that this kind of豫 opera, a typical art of the Central Plains, does have its own value. As long as it can keep up with the needs of the times, strive for progress in itself, and have a few outstanding talents, I dare to assert that the future of豫 opera will definitely surpass that of Yue opera.</p>
<p>Since豫 opera is one of China's local operas, it naturally represents local characteristics. The so-called local characteristics are to reflect the local people's feelings and the desires of the general people's lives. Therefore, the fact that豫 opera is full of Henan sentiments is precisely its characteristic. To a certain extent, this characteristic should not only not be destroyed, but should also be promoted. However, the people's feelings and life desires of a place change with the times, so a drama should not only maintain its local uniqueness, but also maintain its progressive nature of the times. How can豫 opera be an exception?</p>
<p>The focus of reforming豫 opera seems to be grasping the above two principles. Let me solemnly introduce Mr. Fan Cuiting, a modern Henan drama reformer with knowledge, enthusiasm, and perseverance. The new豫 operas he has written and personally directed have reversed the old stereotypes of previous local operas and strongly express the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) It is rich in national revolutionary consciousness and advocates enthusiastic patriotic sentiments, such as "Glorious Return from Overcoming the Enemy," "Female Envoy," "Washing Away Shame with Blood," and "Ye Hanyan."</p>
<p>(2) It is rich in the democratic revolutionary color of anti-feudalism and anti-corruption, such as "Couple Arrows" and "Hate in the Sky."</p>
<p>(3) It is rich in anti-old etiquette and has a subjective desire to actively improve the social status of women, such as "Ambition," "Three Flings of the Sleeves," and "Female Envoy."</p>
<p>(4) It advocates women first and love supreme, such as "Female Chastity Flower" and "Ye Hanyan."</p>

<p>Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (70)</p>
<p>Little Wang's mother smiled and said, "If you don't tell Mr. Xu, you can tell me. When the driver comes back, you can ask him to pick up the boss." Qiwan said, "There's no need to send a car to pick me up. I'll come back by myself." Little Wang's mother said, "It's cloudy today, and I'm afraid it will snow. The weather is very cold. Boss, put on a coat before you go out." Qiwan shook her head and said, "No need, I won't get cold!" Saying that, she left in a hurry. Little Wang's mother sent her to the door and saw that she didn't take a car either and walked straight out of the alley. She was very suspicious. She thought that Qiwan had never acted like this before, and today, she didn't know what was going on, and her attitude and expression had completely changed! Little Wang's mother returned to the room and was just puzzled in her heart. After an hour, Zhuzhai came. When he saw that Qiwan was not at home, he asked Little Wang's mother where the boss had gone. Little Wang's mother said, "I'm puzzled in my heart. I don't know where the boss went. The boss always tells me where she's going and the phone number when she goes out, but she didn't tell me a word today. The weather is bad today, and she didn't go out in her own car. I'm really worried." Zhuzhai listened and just frowned, pacing around the room. After a while, he asked, "Did anyone come to see the boss today?" Little Wang's mother said slowly, "Yes, there was, but I don't recognize him. He was an old man. He talked to the boss for a while and then left!" Zhuzhai didn't pay attention at all and said, "I don't think the boss has anything else to do. She will definitely come back early, because I made an appointment with her to come and find her at Tiande Department Store at 5:00 this afternoon to buy a carpet. The boss wants to buy a blue carpet, and only this department store has it. I'll call her and tell her to go together." Little Wang's mother listened and just pursed her small mouth, smiling ambiguously, and said, "It's already 4:30 now. In half an hour, it will be 5:00." Zhuzhai ignored her and just wandered around the room. When he saw that 5:00 had passed and it was dark, he still didn't see her come. At this time, it was snowing heavily outside. Little Wang's mother called everywhere to inquire, and they all said she hadn't arrived. Zhuzhai was very anxious. Little Wang's mother served the meal, but Zhuzhai couldn't eat it. He waited until 10:00, but Qiwan still hadn't returned. Zhuzhai suspected that she had been dragged to the theater by a friend to see a play. He personally called each theater to inquire, and they all said she hadn't come. Zhuzhai rubbed his hands and said to Little Wang's mother, "I'm really worried. I haven't seen her anywhere. Now the snow is so heavy, and she didn't go out in a car. The snow is thick on the road, and it's not easy to walk. What if she gets hit by a soldier or falls into a ditch! I have to go out and find her." Little Wang's mother said, "Xu Guangsheng, where are you going to look for her?"</p>
