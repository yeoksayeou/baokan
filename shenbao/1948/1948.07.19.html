<h3 id="c27">大鈔果然發行了 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>發行大鈔之說，雖經有關當局屨次否認，斥爲純係謠言；但一般人多不肯深信，本報亦　於十五日著論，闡述當前情勢，預料於短期間即將實現。這並非大家具有先見，居然談言微中；亦不是得到甚麼秘密消息，預知定有這一回事，實以當局闢謠，向不顧到後來的事實。從前侮一次發行大鈔之先，此類照例文章，亦必數數發表，結果則關謠愈力，其去事實愈近，所以大家對於這一類否認的聲明，早已心照不宣，而加以反面的推測了。</p>
<p>現在大鈔的發行，果已於昨日正式發表。其票面爲關金劵一萬元，二萬五千元，五萬元，二十五萬元四種，即等於法幣二十萬元，五十萬元，一百萬元，五百萬元。所謂大鈔兩字，可謂名副其實。値此現鈔奇缺，銀根甚緊之際，此類大鈔，事實上亦或確有此需要。不過國家發行政策，如果照此沿襲下去，不肯斷然予以轉變，則以物價遞漲的結果，仍有「發行較大面額鈔劵，以收兌現行鈔劵之必要。」今之大鈔，不轉瞬間，恐怕又將變爲小鈔。所以央行兪總裁所稱：「政府對於收縮通貨，平抑物價，已有　　之　　。」煙幾句諾言，我們總希望它不是官樣文章，而能迅速兌現。</p>
<p>立法院於七月二日討論總預算案時，政府當局也曾經正式聲明過：卅七年下半年度國家總預算，計普通預算歲出三百二十餘萬億元，特別預算歲出五百九十餘萬億元。普通支出以稅收作抵，且有盈餘，特別預算以出售國有財產物資奧其他辦法作抵，下半年可以不再增發通貨。此外，立法委員並有凍結發行平衡預算的重要提案。因此我們也十二分相信，此次所發大鈔，應不是專爲彌補虧空，而確爲收兌現行鈔票起見。誠如兪總裁所說：「此次發行較大面額之鈔劵，……僅將鈔券面額提高，並非增加發行數量」但是現行的小鈔，究竟如何收兌銷毁？我們希望當局應有一個確切的辦法和聲明。</p>
<p>至於發行大鈔是否影響物價？應以是否確非增加發行數量爲斷，如若一面大發大鈔，而另一面並不收回小鈔，或不收回等値之小鈔；則衡以貨幣數量學說，影響物價的責任，似不應完全嫁諸「投機份子」身上。縱使加以「擾亂金融市塲」的罪　：把他們「依法　究」，恐怕通貨仍收縮不進去，物價亦依個平抑不下來。兪總戴久任財長，對於通貨與物價的關係，聞覓債切，應知我們這些話，斷不是爲「投機份子」有意開股。</p>
<p>立國大本，在於信用，孔子說過：「民無信不立」，又說：「人而無信，不知其可也」。一面矢口關謠，墨　未乾，而一面即將一百萬與五百萬的大鈔，頓時發了出來。雖說兵不厭詐，在這軍事戡亂時期，不妨酌用權術，迅赴事功；但於人民的觀感上，究屬不無潰憾。以後倘再遇「商會及銀錢兩業同業公會負責人同樣請求，仍有發行較大面額鈔票，以收兌現行鈔票之必要」時，我們以爲開誠佈公，與人共見，或亦不失爲民主政治之一道。</p>
<p>兪總裁書面談話又謂：「最近各地鈔劵缺乏，工商業深感週轉困難」。這確是當前的事實，亦是發行大鈔的正當理由。不過金融貴乎自然，商業尤重穩定，無論爲發行大鈔，或爲抑平物價，凡屬忽收忽放，跡近擾亂市塲的人爲手段，似亦應極力避免，以求達到「便利人民」的目的。政治上的手法，縱使十分高明，等到一再表演，一般民衆本諸過去經驗，統通莫逆於心時，其效用恐亦有限了。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕據港訊：中港緝私協定港方遲未完成立法手續，其原因爲后海灣之劃綫間題未決所致。該協定有港政府准許中國海關緝私艦進入后海灣及馬士　兩處香港領海，巡邏檢查之規定。馬士灣港海劃綫已甚明確，至后海灣接近中國海岸之劃綫問題，則必須經中港兩方商討決定後，港方始能提交立法局云。又中澳緝私協定開始實施逾一月，據拱北關副稅務司王作民稱，由於中澳雙方合作收效異常良好，凡經澳門出口之貨物澳政府必通知我海關查核已否辦妥結匯輸出手續，始予放行。現該關各重要關卡與派出之緝私船，全以無綫電聯絡，走私船隻實不易漏網。</p>

<p>〔中央社漢城十八日電〕南韓各地僑商，因受韓方警政人員，及當地浪人之敲詐勒索，而難於維持營業，甚或終至被迫停業者。刻經漢城我國總領館一再向美軍政府交涉後，情形已略告改善，以漢城一地爲例，過去有權搜查華僑商店之地方警務機構，即達十三所。此外，尚有中央物價管理處，警務部搜索局等六機構，所謂十三所地方警務機構，即除漢城首都警廳外，其所屬之京幾道十二警署亦均有權搜查黑市交易爲理由，隨時至商店搜查，其中敲詐勒索，或浪人冒充警政人員之事，曾不斷發生，刻經領館交涉後，此十三機構之搜查權，已告一元化，此後有關當地警方與華僑之事項，概歸首都警廳（稱爲第一警務總監府）辦理；同時各警署官赴華僑商店住宅搜查時，須與領館連絡，或伴同館員前往，夜間搜查，亦允力予避免。至於警務部搜查局，中央警務機關與物價管理處等六機構之職權一元化問題，領館刻正與美軍政府交涉中。</p>

<p>〔中央社漢城十八日電〕南韓華僑貿易商，刻均難於維持，除遭受韓方不良警政份子之勒索外，其最主要原因，爲當地入口稅率，與物品出售價格之不合理規定所致。入口貨物，均由海關按市價即黑市價格徵稅，但出售前，則由物價管理處限定價格，違者嚴處，限價之價格，與黑市價格，相差幾一借。漢城之華僑貿易行百餘家，會請領館設法保護，刻領館已向美軍政府交涉，盼望其一方面依限價之價格徵收入口稅，一方面提高限價，庶幾趨於平衡。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南航訊〕由於龍山之捷，國軍曹振鐸師的錢柏英旅和王敬箴旅擊潰了共匪渤海縱隊，獲得了昌濰戰役以後山東戰塲上的最大勝利。該部等爲獎勵有功，最近都在濟南近郊舉行了隆車的慶功大會，在大會中，各旅皆以迎爲單位，由士兵自己選出此役最有功的官兵爲「戰鬥英雄」，兩個旅各選了七百餘名，合共一千四百餘名。</p>
<p>在舉行慶功大會時，本報記者亦被邀參加。大會的會塲是在各該旅旅部附近的廣塲上，高搭着一個蓆棚作司令台，台的最前面搭有「戰鬥英雄」的松柏彩牌，這裏便是此役最有功的「戰鬥英雄席」。合左貼着高六七尺，寬三十餘尺，紅紙上滿寫着每個戰鬥英雄英名的「英雄榜」。此外，在每個英雄的左胸上，都佩着「戰鬥英雄」的紅布條，這些都是說明盟他們的血肉和胆識所換來的最榮譽的標誌</p>
<p>典禮開始時，首先由王司令官耀武親自發給各「戰鬥英雄一獎章及立功狀，並以最通俗的語句，訓勉大家要做「戰鬥英雄」，「不要做不好種」。接着，曹師長復勉勵大家今天每個旅都只有七百多戰鬥英雄，以後希望侮人都是戰鬥英雄，人人有功，成爲「英雄旅」並擴而爲「英雄師」。再後，國防部的姚視察官說：「軍人事業在戰塲，立功戰塲是軍人最大的光榮，立功同志是我們全體官兵的模範。人人立功，事事立功，消滅其匪，　衛國家。</p>
<p>最後，由戰鬥英雄代表致答詞後，大會即隨着閉幕。幕後，記者訪問了十餘位戰鬥英雄，其中一位名郭生，廿歲，輕機槍射擊手，在攻龍山以北于家莊之戰中，他在砲兵烟幕彈掩護下，首先提着機槍，一個勁撲到了匪軍碉堡前面，但不巧的是正在此緊急關頭，烟幕散了，他旣看見了匪，匪也看見了他，匪就首先以兩挺機槍向他掃射，幸而子彈都在腿子兩側滑過去了，都只將皮膚擦破了。這時他就用一排子機槍把匪打垮，並進而佔領了共匪的交通壕，迎發連中，打死了五個匪兵。這時班長走過來，看到他腿上鮮血直流，誤認爲他受了重傷，但他堅決的說：「這個沒關係，只擦傷了皮」。因此，他被選入爲該連英雄之一。</p>
<p>第二位是姚俊，廿五歲，安徽阜陽人，是個志願兵，在他保衛龍山東南襄城莊時，匪的兩個營攻他兩個班，他因衆寡懸殊，弟兄多戰死，碉堡亦被匪突入，他於萬分緊急時情急智生，乃將機槍放在碉堡上層門板上，並利用黑夜藏匿堡內亂草中，匪疏忽未見，翌晨拂曉時，匪突後退，他就又把機槍拿出來一迎打死了廿多個匪，並把在附近被匪打傷的排長救了回來，奪得匪三挺機愴，十二枝步槍。</p>
<p>此外，記者又訪問了上等兵曹家成，霍連仲等十餘位，他們的英勇作戰精神都使我留下了最深刻的印像。</p>
<p>接着的節目是全體就廣塲上席地聚餐，旅部並爲各戰鬥英雄特設榮譽席，每席由來賓一人作陪。在記者詢問同席的戰鬥英雄，何以該部過去不能打，而現在能打的主要原因時。他告訴我，這完全是由千部隊長一改過去的作風，大家能同甘共苦，患難與共，官兵生活能切實做到打成一片所致。其中有一位更直率的講：「我們可不是傻蛋，假使要完全爲了保持或建立少數人的利益而要我們拼命，我們才不幹呢！」</p>
<p>慶功宴後，並有演戯慰勞。記者由於時間，未及參加，在歸途中，錢旅長柏英告訴我，此項慶功大會完全是由共匪那邊學習來的，對於提高士氣，頗有影響。現在我們遵循的口號是：「尋覓共匪的短處，打擊　人，學習共匪的長處，打擊敵人。」（本報特派員麗天）。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕西歐聯盟最重要的一章，將於十九日五國外長在海牙開會時開始。貝文外相於啓程前在滑鐵尙車站表示，希望此去歸來時，得　來西歐五國之軍事同盟公約。皮杜爾外長　巴黎北站時亦聲明，法國將在海牙之會中，要求承認締結五國軍事同盟之需要。參與海牙會議者除貝文皮杜爾外，為比外長史巴克，荷外長波茨勒，盧森堡外長貝克。首次會議由荷外長波茨勒任主席，該會主要任務在鄭重處理延擱已久之五國軍事同盟問題。五國同盟之永久軍事委員會在倫敦秘密討論結束，已完成軍事同盟之初步研究報告，將在海牙會議中提出討論。英外交部人士透露英國亦已草具一軍事性之草約，將由貝文向海牙會議提出，而法國外交部人士謂法國亦已擬具反建議，將由皮杜爾提出。此外海牙會議並將討論由荷比盧協助西德與柏林間空運之問題，荷闌傳已準備將飛機一隊供英調用。員文於上週雖曾否認渠曾要求荷比盧協助空運，然就荷比盧與三强倫敦啊議之密切關係，可以斷定在目前之緊急狀態下，英美法決不致單獨行動。另一將在海牙會議中討論之問題爲統一西歐在菲洲殖民地政策之點，比領剛果及法屬馬達加斯加之鈾，南菲羅牧西亞之鐡　土，可能由西歐五國統一利用，其細則辦法已經倫敦及巴黎之兩委員會擬就，將在海牙會議中提出討論。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕英外部行國司長史屈朗·美大使陶格拉斯·法大使馬西格里合組之委員會，於下週起將逐日開會，以注視柏林局勢，同時並將研究將如何動員西方盟國之軍事及經濟力量，以無定期維持對柏林之空中供應綫。該會並將研究西方三强是否得爲柏林問題而準備赴戰，在此等狀况下，三强可資動用之資源狀能將如何。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫教十七日電〕權威方面承認召開四强會議討論德國整個問題，爲唯一可能避免爲柏林問題對蘇作危險性之攤牌。目前美英法將暫保緘默，靜待明日在海牙舉行之西歐聯盟五國會議，然後再決定對付柏林危機之次一行動。在此一會議中，英外相貝文及法外長皮杜爾將對柏林問題，作全盤檢討，探詢比荷盧三國意見，然後起草對蘇覆文。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕美，英，法三强正準備爲柏林問題，對蘇聯提出抗議。權威方面稱，新照會可能在下週未完成。權威方面稱，新照會將縝密計劃，反駁莫斯科將柏林對鎖之責任，歸咎于西方强國，但同時將避免任何關于在不久將來，將以强硬行動突破封鎖之挑戰性措辭。官方認爲此舉殊屬重要，蓋如此項糾紛提出聯合國或國際法庭時，可將威脅和平之罪咎歸之蘇聯，同時西方强國在德國之軍力，亦不足爲哀的美頓書之後盾。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十七日電〕據與蘇軍政府有密切接觸之政界人士稱，蘇聯或將派蘇聯超空堡壘一隊飛德，以答覆美國之派超空堡壘六十架飛歐。據云，蘇軍政府參謀長魯坎眞哥，蘇駐德航空司令亞歷山持洛夫，及德境其他蘇聯領袖，曾於今晨在卡爾斯霍爾斯特舉行會議，考慮蘇聯對於美方所採行動應取之對策。駐德若干蘇方高級官員將於週未飛莫斯科，與國防部長布爾加寗舉行會議。柏林蘇方人士謂美國超空堡壘之抵英，其意義較任何抗議照會爲大，表示西方盟國不再僅事作政治上的抗議，而將表現實際的强硬態度。蘇方人士復曰，蘇聯超空堡壘與美國超空堡壘火力相同，惟績航力及速率則在後者之上。據云，係根據一九四五年初被迫降落滿洲之美超堡壘一座模仿改良而成。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>〔紐約七月九日航訊〕紐約及華盛頓朝野人士，一般認為共和黨正副總統候選人杜威與華倫這勝利當選，殆無疑問。記者自巴黎飛抵紐約之日，適費城共和黨全國代表大會開幕不久。全美與論對於杜威之「出山」。均有極厚重之評價。甚多美國雜誌及期刋，紛紛以杜威之相片，作爲最近一期之對面。</p>
<p>共和黨將贏得十一月勝利之原因，厥爲：第一，杜威個人在美國社會之聲望，非其他政客可以匹敵。一度曾爲華萊士主編之「新典和雜誌」，載稱：「今日全美國人民，無有不熟知，不仰慕湯姆斯杜威之名字者，其政治聲望之崇高，以及其競選技巧之純熟高明，決非其他人士可以比擬」。過去在羅斯福四任總統期間，惟杜威差可與之一較身手。而共和黨副總統候選人華倫州長，在西海岸之人望與治績，亦爲美國人士所津津樂道。加利福尼亞州上次選舉州長時，華倫被共和·民主兩黨公推爲唯一之候選人。記者於一九四六年旅行加利福尼亞時，曾晤華氏，知其謙恭細密與樸實之作風。近三年來，美國之太平洋海岸，在加速度中繁榮與開發，華倫之人望與政績，亦有助於杜威之勝利。</p>
<p>其次，民主黨佔據白宮，垂十六年，羅斯福總統當年之時代使命，業已過去。羅斯福死後，黨內分裂，杜魯門之才能魄力威望，均不足以出任世界領導國家之行政首長。記者發此稿時，距民主黨全國代表大會，尚有三日，民主黨內部，正醞釀汹湧之「倒杜魯閂運動」，紐約市長奧德華，以現任行政官吏地位，大聲疾呼：「杜魯門不配連任，民主黨應圖自救」。紐約對河之紐傑賽州，原爲民主黨之老巢，該州「黨務老闆」（英文稱之爲黨務機器），海格氏稱：民主黨若推舉杜魯門爲競選人，則無異將紐澤賽州之數十萬張選票，雙手拱讓於共和黨。</p>
<p>民主黨之另一主要「機器」，即芝加哥之開萊納希機器，（開萊納希，爲兩人名，羅斯福競選時之有力支持者），該機器之現任老闆阿維，日前趕來紐約，與奧德華市長密謀，進行「倒杜魯門運動」，阿維之理想民主黨總統候選人爲艾森豪威爾元帥，此意見曾獲得加利福尼亞州民主黨支部負責人小羅斯福（即前總統羅斯福之長公子）之熱烈贊助，小羅斯福在洛杉機發動「推舉艾帥出任總統」之大遊行，引起美國南方諸州，（民主黨老家）之熱烈響應。參議員癈貝爾亦謂，艾森豪威爾元帥應爲最理想之人選。（按艾帥已公開拒絕競選）</p>
<p>艾森豪威爾之聲望，可以與杜魯門唱一對手，惟艾森豪威爾本身並非民主黨之黨員。艾帥本身，亦常以「無黨派人士」自慰，在渠辭謝被擁戴之聲明中，亦一再提到：「不願屬諸任何黨派」。據熱悉美國政界內幕之人士談，艾帥一向之政治關係，與其說爲民主黨，母寗稱之為與共和黨更為密切。就艾帥個人之利害設想，今年出而與杜威競選，當爲不智之舉（紐約每日新聞社評語）。最近　週來，艾帥辦公之哥倫比亞大學校長室中，函電堆積，均爲「勸進表」一類信件，艾帥於答覆佛羅里達一退伍軍人之書信中稱：個人計劃於此數年間，致力於最有興趣之教育事業。對於任何政治活動，決定謝却。</p>
<p>最近數日來，艾森豪威爾之行動，已為新聞記者及政治集團所包圍，艾帥之一舉一動，盡爲新聞之最好鏡頭。昨夜，有五千人自稱爲艾帥之「崇拜者」，在距離記者住處不遠之晨煦路六十號哥侖比亞大學校長官邸，高呼口號，請求艾帥出而競選總統。艾帥揮手連呼「晚安」！「有便請到學校辦公室來談！」對政治競選，仍絕口不提。</p>
<p>若干民主黨人士，仍主張不管艾帥允諾與否，仍推艾森豪　爾為總統候選人。但若干「倒杜魯門派」人士如奧德華市長，王張推舉華盛頓最高法院之大法官陶格拉斯。陶氏為民主黨先進，屬民主黨中之　左派，但聲望遠不膠共和黨之杜威有力。一大部份民主黨之「正統」，仍多方爲杜魯門拉攏，渠等之口號爲：「團結一致，同心同德，不要爲敵黨造機會，不要使自己力量分散！」</p>
<p>如果艾森豪威爾能轉變意志，則艾帥當能爲杜威之勁敵。但照目前情形看，艾帥決不肯爲民主滅「出山」，則杜魯門無疑仍爲民主黨之總統候選人，果爾，則當更爲杜威造成有利之機會。共和黨在十一月間可能取得空前的壓倒優勢。</p>

<p>革新應求澈底</p>
<p>力氏詞舉，各級幹部同志繼起發言，至爲踴躍，綜合其要點如下：（一）革新黨務之任務，非由少數中委所能完成，須徵得全體黨員之意旨，故應請中央從速召開全國代表大會，檢討黨務，以謀眞正之革新。（二）應請政府實行民生主義之方案，以求平均地櫂，節制資本之實現。（三）此次革新，應求澈底，避免官僚作風，防止　惜革新之名，從事其他企圖。會議至十二時許始散。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕我國鐵路史上設備最完善，最新穎，行駛速率最高，而經交通部俞部長親爲定名之「飛快車」，經兩路局戚墅堰機廠年餘之埋頭趕造，迄昨日止已全部完工。全列車定今晨五時二十分自戚墅堰廠開出試車，六時二十分至蘇州，停留五分至十分鐘後，即行折返，七時半回廠。各部份機件將再經嚴密週詳之檢查，如成績良好，明晨將再度試車來滬，時間或在淸晨，或在深夜。如試車成績完全滿意，則本月二十二日可正式加人京滬綫行駛。</p>
<p>往來京滬　只停鎭錫</p>
<p>路局爲該列車之加入行駛，特將全綫行車時刻表重行調整，上行飛快車（二〇二次車）於上午七時半田上北站開，沿途停靠無錫，鎭江兩站，於中午十二時半抵達南京下關站。下行飛快車（二〇一次車）於下午六時開，晚十一時抵上北站。</p>
<p>票價</p>
<p>飛快車票價經路局各部門負責人一再會商後，昨日巳由運務處擬訂，上海至南京六百萬元，至鎮江五百七十二萬元，至無錫三百九十五萬元。此項票價，運務處當日即簽呈局長陳伯荘作最後決定。</p>
<p>高廠長談　延期原因</p>
<p>據　墅堰機廠廠長高振洲談稱：該列車之客事暸望車中冷氣裝置，安樂椅，收音機油漆等工程，於本月十五日晨五時已全部完竣，惟供給全列車冷氣動力之發電機損壞，故出廠時期不得不予展延。新發電機甫於日前由美國運到掉換，經日夜趕裝完工，且經數度試行發電，成績殊爲滿意。故冷氣部份大致已可不再發生障礙。</p>
<p>火車小姐　隨車招待</p>
<p>飛快車中行車那務人員，路局特遴選最優秀者加以嚴格訓練，且試用「火車小姐」五位，担任瞭望車之酒吧間及餐車中招待事宜。路同招考時標準甚高，聞五位「火車小姐」均爲高中畢業生。火車行車服務人員選用女性，此次尚屬創舉，衆料「火車小姐」將繼「空中小姐」之後成爲婦女界之一新職業。</p>

<h3 id="c100">凄凉「上海少爺」　在漲風前低了頭　豪華夢醒開始嘗人間苦味 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕數十年來，上海始終是大衆心目中的淘金聖地，享樂名區，似乎任何人祗要在這都市裏廝混兩年，就不難白手起家，優遊度日。你看馬路上那些來往交織的人流中，不是儘多高視闊步的標準「少爺型」的人物嗎？所謂「少爺」的定義頗費注解，反正風度翩翩，略通人情，胸懷應世邱壑，家有隔宿存糧，至少，在一般傭僕們眼裡，他總是個「少爺」罷了。</p>
<p>上海少爺們黃金時代的急遽消逝，還是最近的事。接連幾個熾烈漲風，足以優遊享樂的基礎應聲摧毀。少爺們纔開始嘗到取之盡錙銖，用之如泥沙的苦味。根據統計：電影院加價後營業激减，中上級西服店門可羅雀，還有，夜花園和舞廳完全在靠中年以上的人撑塲面，現在少爺們巳是力不從心了。</p>
<p>少爺們最覺痛心疾首的是影票一漲就達二百萬。這還成什麼大衆娛樂？排隊購買限價票吧，多麼長的行列！萬一冤家路狹，碰着情人翩然蒞止，那時體面掃地，情何以堪？考慮再三，結果決定還是買一張說明書回去細細翩讀，劇情瞭然，也可聊慰相思。但是走出門口，那些廣告上的豪華塲面眞够誘惑，使人意興蘭珊，週身無力。叫部三輪軍，討價卅萬，少爺淡淡地還了個半價，車夫更淡淡地回道：「乘不起！還是走走吧！」什麼？乘不起？這個侮辱使少爺感到太難堪了。</p>
<p>其實更難堪的事正多着呢！少爺們最近舞塲很少去了，但又不免偶爾乘與一往，聽說茶資巳過百萬，按照往例召喚舞女伴坐的勇氣頓時消失，偏偏兩個熱識的大班還要爭獻殷動：「少爺，珍珍在招呼你吶！」眞的，珍珍何嘗不是向自己露着誘惑的微笑？但她又爲什麼和一般老頭兒繾綣不休？一如往昔在自己的身傍。旋律悠悠，舞池光景不殊，往事未必是夢啊！幾度漲風使少爺們低頭了。</p>
<p>新裝難再添　箱底疊舊衣</p>
<p>倘使漲風單在娛樂部門內盤旋，少爺們還可竭力忍受，但事實上衣食費用也時時刻刻在向少爺們的儀表挑戰。千萬以上的維他命劑久不進服了，連排骨麺也要六十萬一碗，營養不良，容光黯淡，什麼進修？什麼工作效率？又從那裏談起！西裝三億一襲，自頂至踵，如果要出落得衣冠整齊，那就非六億莫辦。少爺們新裝既不能備，舊衣倒確實洋洋可觀，晚來入睡前把它從箱底檢出，一件一件地，鄭重摺疊，想起自己前數年曾爲這些　裳裝飾過的雍容豐采，便指着箱子對傭婦說：「你不要看輕它，這點身價戰前足够開十家銀行啦！」</p>
<p>有一天晚間，大世界附近命相攤上來了一位少爺。他告訴瞎先生他確實是個「少爺」，祖　深厚，薄有家產，但是在最近漲風中也告捉襟見肘了，所以他要測算漲風何時能平？瞎先生給嚇了一跳，連忙搖搖頭：「這是劫數啊！算不出的。」少爺頗像聽不慣「劫數」兩個字，打了一聲哈哈說：「至多少爺不做就是了，替投機的大老闆們做跑街，潛水手　　做嚮導不一樣？</p>
<p>何堪舊地重來　皆為柴米煩心</p>
<p>西區公園裡有一個園丁曾經目覩過這樣一件事實：茂林深處在去年春天出現過一對情人，男的就是公園附近某家的「少爺」，兩相偎依，終日留連，未出一月就結婚了。「少爺」結婚原是天經地義，卑之無甚高論；但是他接着說：前晚他們倆又帶了孩子來逛公園，今年還是第一次，仍舊坐在老地方，剛坐下來兩口子就吵，吵的中心原來爲了撙即開支。這情景，在想像中是够悽凉的。輕憐密愛，曾幾何時？竹聲新月，猶似當年，但幾度漲風，上海少爺就這樣悲悲戚戚地垮了。</p>

<p>惟日昨復又發生如此重大不幸事件，危及職工及觀衆生命安全，誠使該業無法生存，全市一百數十家戲劇院塲，感於危險性之嚴重如此，而將來營業爲難，一體主張立即停業。昨日下午，該會召開理監事緊急聯席會議，則以時値戡亂，一且全部停業，勢必影響社會安寗，力勸同業顧全大局，照常營業，至忠勇將士，輾轉征戰，艱辛浴血，原所仰戴，惟商民謀生，亦非容易，希望能體諒商民困難，多予維護，得使全市依賴戲劇業生活之數十萬人生計勿斷，而市民能獲正當娛樂」。再據該業公會表示：「目前物價之高如此，該業開支浩大，維持困難，日前發表上半月生活指數，較前增加幾達一倍，所發職工薪金一項，即難負担，實巳瀕臨崩潰，不堪發生意外矣。」該業對此次軍憲警各方臨時彈壓得宜，亦深感謝。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕市警局消防總處所辦的市民緊急救護總隊，人們替它起了一個時髦的別名，叫做「上海護士」。以五輛救護車爲骨幹，每車上配備護士一人警員三人司機一人，由一位醫師担任指揮的神經中樞，這一位大衆護士的辛勤服務，把不少臨危的生命從死神手中搶奪了回來。</p>
<p>這一天「上海護士」第一次出動是在半夜裡二點零三分。河南路消防總處的大廈中，號碼爲「一入六〇〇」的電話鈴聲，在靜穆的夜空中似乎特別地賽，値班的警員機敏地接聽了電話，不消一分鐘光景，一輛白色救護車就開出來了。電話是從東大名路三百七十八號民生公司那邊打來的，救護車在夜色籠罩下靜悄悄的街道上開足馬力，沒有多少時候就抵達目的地。出事者是一個小工名叫萬小保的，他被銅箱壓傷了足部，左大足趾完全骨折，血流個不停。這一種情形在「上海護士」的工作人員看來簡直是微乎其微的傷害，他們曾經看見過多少大塲面，救護過多少瀕於死亡邊緣的傷者病者，所以對於這一位小工，他們毫不費力的把他抬上了救護車，用紗布棉花替他洗滌創口，用三角板止血帶替他包紮受傷的足部，同時救護車已在向魷近的上海衛生療養院出發了。到達醫院後，他們將病人交給院方，這樣就完成了第一次的任務，救護車在依舊寂靜的街道上，駛回消防總處，本來是墨黑的天空上，露出絲絲月光來了。</p>
<p>時刻在緊張中渡過　從這一次開始，「上海護士」不斷地在緊張中渡過她忙碌的一天。五點二十分時，江灣警分局有一個股員舊病突發，待救護車理到，却又痊愈了，不願去醫院，這樣「上海護士」空跑了一次。六點四十四分時，勞爾東路上有一個姓沈的從樓上跌下，面部受傷，鼻子深深地裂開了，人時時昏暈，「上海護士」把他送到紅十字會醫院。六點五十六分，廣西路上有一對姓莢的夫婦，被仇家用刀刺傷，男的血流過度，已不省人事，女的比較輕一點，兩人都送到仁濟醫院。七點四十一分，江蘇路愚園路口有一個姓莊的男子騎自由車被卡車掩到輾傷，送到醫院時心跳呼吸都已停止，回生乏術了。八點四十五分白利南路有人腹痛嘔吐。九點十五分建國中路有人從屋頂跌下。九點三十四分，小東門方浜路坍屋傷人。九點五十四分，北京東路有人吐血。十點四十五分，北京路又有人患急病。十三點，乍浦路一一九號打電話來請「上海護士」，待趕到則病人巳送往別處了。十三點三十九分，虹口區隊隊員姓宋的患急性盲腸炎。十四點四十分，龍華廟有人打架，一個姓葉的胸部挫傷，有骨折可能。……十七點三十八分，惠明路一位姓翁的小弟弟被狗咬傷了左脚……十九點十二分，蘇州河上一個船戶被開水燙傷……二十點十五分，大世界附近某旅館裏有人服毒……二十三　點十八分，南京路江西路口一位海軍士兵被電車撞傷……這一天的最後一次出動是在二十點二十分，麥根路東京路有一位居民名呌薛興生飲酒過度，昏迷不省人事，「上海護士」將他送到了宏仁醫院。</p>
<p>抬到車上先予急救　類似這一天的出動急救，「上海護士」經常地義務爲市民服務，她的工作人員不分畫夜，輪流値勤，一接到電話就把救護車開出去把傷者或病人抬到車上，先加以包紮敷藥施急救，一面轉送醫院，把病人付託，取得傷　後，才完成她的任務。在七月份她每天要出動三十三次，從三十四年至本年六月爲止，共出動急救一萬零六十七次，救護一萬零三百五十六次，時疫一千六百二十八次，救護一千六百七十五人。她所爭取的是時間，你如果在車輛擁擠的街道上看見漆　「一八六〇〇」電話號碼的白色救護車「鳴鳴」飛馳而過，這就是「上海護士」爲市民盡職的時候了。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員劉問渠</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十五日航訊〕酷暑天氣，舒適的滬牯聯運車不能抵抗炎威。南昌是中國四大熱城之一，淸晨七時即揮汗如雨，中午的九江不無凉爽，乘汽車到蓮花洞，纔有些許凉風。距避暑聖地祗十餘里，心中暗忖，兩小時後，炎熱將其奈我何！選擇了一乘山轎，殺出轎夫的包圍圈，踏上去，看着轎夫起步，一顫一顫的轎桿，有些飄飄然，滿心憧憬着山上的凉爽——然而，不然。</p>
<p>八肩挑一人　登山便是爬坡，一避暑聖地」是不容易　登的，現在是由八隻脚代替了兩隻脚，八個肩頭肩負着一百幾十磅的重量和一個人安全的責任。轎夫們的裝束大抵相同，赤着背，（祗有極少數穿着短褂），一條白布或藍布披在肩頭，用右肩（相當時候後要換到左肩）的肉，和生硬的扁担磨擦。腰帶繫着的是黑布或藍布褲，褲筒捲起，赤脚，趿着一雙草鞋。胸·背·臂膀·大腿，是古銅色的，表現出健康和力量。都是二三十歲的小夥子，可是等到抬起轎子，邁開大步時，背上立刻泛起汗珠，由米粒大小，變成黃豆般大小，停留不住，便在背上開起溝渠，滾滾而下，濕了褲腰，濕了褲管，也濕了草鞋。坐在轎中的人，正好面對着這幅景象——個人的快樂建築在他人的痛苦之上！希望着的凉爽的享受，山景的欣賞，這時會被這幅景象所驅逐。望着轎夫流汗，心中浮起同情和憐憫之感，不覺也燥熟起來。</p>
<p>將近兩千名的轎夫，支持着這個作爲「避暑聖地」的牯嶺的桂冠。他們代避著客流出多量的汗，他們以酷熱換來避暑客的凉爽</p>
<p>汗水不白流　當然，轎夫們的汗不是白流的，而他們的生活，也仰給於兩肩和兩腿。最近的價錢，每乘山幡由述花洞到牯嶺，代價是五百八十萬元，乘客體重超過一百六十磅的，增加二名轎夫，增收二百九十萬元。這五百八十萬元中，有一百萬元是爲前次罷抬毆傷的轎夫作醫藥費，每名轎夫祗得九十七萬元，其餘則是管理局的管理費。由於轎夫人數衆多，遊客尚未過份踴躍，每天能輪到一次，往來三十里，換來九十七萬元，已是幸運的了。</p>
<p>未了的舊案　大體說來，牯嶺的轎夫分作兩帮：一帮是本地帮，大約有一千四百多人，一帮是湖北帮，大約有五百多人。七月初的罷抬，是本地帮主動，管理局要湖北帮維持交通，本地帮遷怒於湖北帮，當他們吃飯的時候，突然的襲擊來了，湖北帮轎夫「閉門家中坐，禍從天上來」，一陣狂風暴雨，結果是七人重傷，二十餘人輕傷，還有二人失踪。這案子，由九江地方法院審理，迄今尚未了結。　這祗是偶然的事情。事情過後，雙方似未積下仇恨，蓮牯交通恢復了，他們又肩起了重祖。</p>
<p>從夏到秋冬　生活打發着日子，他們依然爬上爬下，或抬着避暑客去遊覽名勝。收人雜持一個單身漢還容易，但他們大多數是有家累的，老婆孩子，住在蓮花洞，要靠兩肩兩腿去瞻養。「生活高了，一雙草鞋要五萬元呢！」這是他們的口頭語。</p>
<p>生意最好的時候，從上午五時到下午七時，可以來回走三次。但那在一個夏季中也是很少見的。能抬到兩次時，便招致無數羡慕的限光了。要是一天輪不上一次，也祇好自認晦氣。</p>
<p>一個夏天，大致不會沒有生意。避暑客大把鈔票向牯嶺拋，轎夫們也分潤一部份來維持一家老小的生活。到了秋冬，問題便來了。冬天是難得有幾個人上山的，於是本地帮都回到田地裏，從七月農忙開始。湖北帮沒有田地，祗好給人作作雜工，或是在荒山上砍柴。那生活更要艱苦，所以他們寗願流大量的汗，來賺這九十七萬塊錢。</p>
<p>長班幸運兒　總統官邸中的長班轎夫，一共十八個人，其中一個是　長，每八個人抬一乘山轎，總統和夫人每人一乘。另外一個人則是替工。他們只是等總統上山時，忙個一陣。然而總統一年中難得上兩次山，每次上山又難得住一個月，因此，他們一年中的工作，可能僅是一兩個月，其他時候便毫無所事。最忙的一陣，是卅五年夏天，國共和談正在熱烈展開中，總統夫婦在山上住的很久，還加上馬歇爾九次來去。馬歇爾特備一乘轎子，也是八個人抬，這八個人是由蓮花洞那二千轎夫中挑選出來的，他們也過了一個夏天的好日子。</p>
<p>今年的希望　今年，轎夫們存着很大的希望。牯嶺避暑客，尤其是外僑。今年相當多。轎夫們準備着更多的汗，更多的力量，要爲圖享受的避暑客們服務。好漢坡有九百多級，爬上這一段路，至少要廿分鐘，這羣轎夫們都是久經訓練的「好漢」，他們毫未考慮到路徑的崎嶇，更不用說驕陽的炙晒或大雨的侵淋，他們將用兩肩兩腿，繼續支持着「避暑聖地」的桂冠。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十二日航訊〕七月八日，劉明鐸醫師在靑島醫學分會上作特別報告，說到實施腦額葉切斷術的方法。他說：「關於額葉切斷術的方法：麻醉可用Avertn或Ether與油的直腸麻醉，或打全身麻醉，在距顴骨上緣及眶上緣眉外角6cm處橫切開，或者弧形切開，分開顳肌，尋出顱骨的額頂縫，在那個地方用穿顱器打開顱骨，切開硬腦膜，把額葉皮質用利刃成縱方向切斷，再用鈍金屬板放入皮質的切縫內，把白質切斷，直至大腦縑爲止Teritorium　Cerebrum將金屬成扇形方向移動以完成切斷，但須注意，不能傷及顳葉及額葉後部。額葉的切斷，如果太前或者太淺，則手術結果不佳或無效。如果太後，則傷及運動中樞，言語運動中樞及寫字中樞等，太深則使大腦鎌受傷，而引起不能止的出血，所以切口的位置以及深度特別重要。</p>
<p>他舉起一具頭骨標本，指給我看鑿洞開刀的部位，然後畫一個草圖，兩個精神病患者和和安樹文，（不能語言患者），就在這裏開刀，那部位大約是所謂兩個「太陽穴」的上後方。文惠生（羊癲合併左側偏癱）則在右頭頂擊開顱骨。</p>
<p>每一次手術要歷兩小時，打開顱骨的時間最費了，大部份手術時間化在這上面。創口縫合之後，顱骨會慢慢生長。</p>
<p>一個病息者頭髮剃光，受過麻醉，躺在手術台上，無影燈照得通亮，頭部用紗布紮好，只露出開刀的部位。一羣醫師圍着，幾雙手侍候在打開的洞口，血水流着，手術室裏只有脚步聲和金聲器具的碰擊聲，以及短促的低語，那情景和施行別的並無分別。顱骨打開了，露出神秘的腦部，它在活動着，血管在隱隱地跳，這柔軟的生命顯示在視綫之下，手術的要點便在這時開始，幾分鐘立刻縫合創口。劉明鐸醫師的手術是成功的。</p>
<p>全世界該有多少瘋子亟待這有效的一割啊！（全稿完）</p>
<h3 id="c122">硤石羊種繁殖塲　考力黛在蓬勃氣象中發展 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者陳劍雄</p>
<p>〔本報嘉興十四日訊〕嘉屬一帶，素稱魚米之鄉，其完以這裏的出產來講，確是一個經濟的寳藏。食有米，衣有絲和羊毛，如平湖的菜籽，桐鄉的烟葉，嘉善的磚瓦……可以說人生日常所需，無一或缺。何以今日嘉屬的農民，還是言苦，這完全是農民不知改進，墨守舊法所致。</p>
<p>前十區專署，爲了開掘這一個寳藏，與農林部畜牧實驗所合作，於去年十月間，擇定了海寗硤石的東山脚下，闢了一個嘉區綿羊繁殖塲，用澳洲的「考力黛」羊種，來改進嘉區的土種羊。</p>
<p>目前該塲共畜「考力黛」百頭，「考力黛」是世界的名種，毛細長而柔軟，尤其頭部毛長達四寸以上，可紡五十六支紗，平均較土種長約三倍，每年剪一次，可得九斤左右。據說土種每年僅可剪二斤左右，故數量方面，亦達三倍。現據該塲估計，嘉區如以卅萬頭土種羊計算，共產羊毛六十萬斤，如全部能以「考力黛」種改進後，則羊毛產量可產至一百八十萬斤，再每斤售價，如較土種增加十分之五計算，則對整個嘉區經濟上的眞正貢獻，豈是〔農貸」之類所可比擬？</p>
<p>改良土種羊的方法，是採用級進制，一頭「考力黛」的純種公羊，去交配土羊，產下來的小羊，爲第一代改進種，這一代的改良種的毛質和毛量，僅能較土種羊增進一倍，再由這一代的改良種與純種「考力黛」交配，產下來的第二代，其毛質和毛量又增進至純種的三分之一，如此交配三次後的改良種，便可和純種一樣的毛質和毛量了。</p>
<p>現在該塲已勘定嘉興的王店。海鹽的沈蕩，武源·海寗的袁化·金石墩·長安·崇德的芝橋·安登橋·城區·及桐鄉城區等十處，分設交配站，正在積極進行中。故一交配站設置純種「考力黛」二隻以上，每隻純種羊自然交配，最多能交配三百隻。該塲以嘉區土羊衆多，不數交配，現該塲許塲長前曾赴京請領人工授精機械，機械領到後，即增加了三倍交配的數量。這一個開發經濟的事業，無形中給嘉區農民以經濟上的帮助不少。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶十八日電〕渝衛生局十七日正式發表楊妹偷食各情之公報，該局以楊妹僅有能忍飢廿一夭硏究價値，該局於五月舉行之檢驗，共廿一天，楊確未進食。此次檢驗期中，（上月廿日迄今）楊偸食數量不多，足證楊能忍飢達廿一天，認爲無主動要求檢驗之價値。故今後工作，將視楊妹或其監護人之請求爲定。如楊或其監護人請求檢驗時，則衛生局將提出一定條件，以便檢驗之進行。惟僉信楊妹於秘密揭穿後，必將於最近返石硅鄉間。又一般對此事件之後果，認爲楊妹係一鄉間女子，並無多大責任，但其監護人明知楊妹需食物而生，而故弄如此玄虛，實有不可寬恕之嫌。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南十五日航訊〕面對着今天遠較過去任何時期尤爲艱苦的局面，山東當局爲了消極的要做到予大批失學失業的靑年以敎育，救濟，訓練兼顧，爲國家匯集保存一股强大的力量，積極的做到培植大量戡建工作之軍政基層幹部以加强戰鬥體制，乃繼元首在抗戰期間所號召的「十萬靑年十萬軍」之後，在山東招訓了八千靑年軍，成立了靑年敎導總隊。</p>
<p>白馬山中一盛會</p>
<p>靑敎總隊共分三團，總名額是八千人，除第二團因營址在修葺中尚未開學外，其餘一·三兩團約五千人，十日在濟郊前省幹訓團舊址的白爲山正式舉行入營典禮。在舉行入營典禮那天，差不多所有省垣各界首長都參加了，無疑的，就山東講，這是空前未有的盛會。</p>
<p>五千青年軍宣誓</p>
<p>九時半，入營典禮開始，五千靑年軍首以最高亢雄偉的聲調宣讀了他們的誓詞：「面臨國家多難，我們基於良知，出於至誠，願以火的熱情，鐵的意志，在最高統帥領導之下，服從命令，遵守紀律，不畏難，不怕死，造成新生革命力量，實行三民主義，完成戡亂建國的偉大使命。」接着，兼總隊長王耀武以「立大志，親愛精誠，不怕苦，不怕死」四事相勗。</p>

<p>最別開生面，同時也贏得全塲熱烈掌聲的，是省參議長裴鳴宇即席賦詩一首以贈：「八千子弟起靑齊，重整河山志亦奇，誓掃妖氛靖國難，願憑隻手拯災黎。悲歌燕趙多豪傑，慷慨英雄自女兒，戡亂如今堪試胆，鷄鳴起舞莫違時。」</p>

<h3 id="c134">一般物價　看漲心理旺盛　前途殊堪警惕 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>上週一般物價，週初開盤機，由於前週末上漲過猛，同時當局宣布，將大量拋售物資，藉以抽緊銀根，居高思危，人心虛軟，浮多頗有吐售，如棉紗回跌約一成左右。週中因銀根緊，暗息高，漲落參差，走勢較穩。及至週五以後，因當局公布七月份上半月生活費指數，工人爲一三八萬倍，警員爲一〇七萬倍，兼之發行大鈔之說，甚囂塵上，物價再見回升。上過批發物價總指數爲三，六三七，一三五倍，較前過上升百分之三四·一八，已突破三百萬倍大關，瞻念前途，殊堪警惕。上週銀根，就國行交換情形而論，不算過緊，但暗息曾一度高達七角以上，由此可見大家對於法幣信心的微弱，物價看漲心理的旺盛。</p>
<p>國行前爲現鈔籌碼枯竭，曾規定各行莊每日領取現鈔額爲四十億元，一百億元及二百億元三種，上週因月半指數公布，屆發薪之期，現鈔需要，尤見殷切，但當局因恐刺激物價上漲，對於大鈔的發行，一再否認，以致引起市塲極大的不便。日來各地匯水，有畸形偏高的現象，與此種現鈔籌碼的缺乏，當不無關係。通貨膨脹的結果，籌碼數額自然劇激的增多，當局不能從根本處多多謀對策，此種拾本逐末的方法，確有修正的必要。</p>
<p>關於今年下半年度的國家總預算一案，於本月二日由翁院長向立法院提出討論，據立法院秘書處息：「總預算之要點：（一）普通預算可以用稅收抵支，可有盈餘。（二）特別預算可以出售各種物資與其他辦法相抵，下半年可不再增加通貨發行。」</p>
<p>又據悉：卅七年下半年國家總預算，計普通預算歲出三百二十餘萬億元，特別預算歲出五百九十餘萬億元。總預算內並說明普通支出以稅收作抵，且有盈餘；特別預算以出售國有財產物資徵實檄借及債款收入作抵，可以不再增發紙幣。此案先由立院預算委員會分組審查，於十四日再行綜合審查，據立院新聞組息，大體對收入部份增列，支出部份核减。</p>
<p>行憲政府對人民應負責任的第一件大事，要算預算問題，但這次立院審核預算，始終在「秘密」會議中進行，與行憲前的作風，似無分別，身爲主人翁的人民，反不知道底細，我們不僅感覺遺憾，同時更應喚醒人民，多多注意，形成風氣，促使政府公開預算，因爲預算不平衡，這是當前一切經濟病源的所在，不容絲毫忽略的。</p>
<p>此外，際茲審核預算聲中，我們覺得政府在開源節流方面，還有很多地方是應做而未做到的。舉例說：最近新成立的戡亂建國委貝會，聽說委員有九百名到數千名之多，全部簡任待遇，對於此種措施，國家支出鉅額公帑，實有商榷的必要，我們願喚醒當局，今天的物價指數，已在三百萬倍以上，人民犧牲於高物價下者不知凡幾，政府確不容絲毫浪費了。</p>
<p>上週商品市塲一般物價走勢，出於前週末已登高位，復因銀根趨緊，週初週中，均在疲途徘徊。自週五起，國行交換差出　一萬三千億之鉅，銀根鬆弛，消息利多，買氣旺盛，各物一致回升，與前週末原盤接近，但尚少新價出現。</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按用途分類者如次：</p>

<p>上週批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如次：</p>
<h3 id="c135">貨幣金融　銀根一度吿緊暗息普見挺昂 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>上週本市銀根，雖一度緊極，但爲時不過兩三天，又轉告鬆弛了。此次銀根之所以一度告緊，果然是受當局拋售物資，國家行局鉅額差進的影響，但據悉與週二行局壓置各地匯款，亦不無關係。不過，這種築壩斷流的方法究竟不能持久，所以到了週五，銀根之鬆弛，又成燎原之勢了。</p>
<p>上週的另一現象，爲現鈔　碼的仍覺匱乏，這當然是受物價猛漲，計算籌碼相形見短的刺激，不過在高額的內匯率下，由於以款子匯往各埠的折損太多，運現就變成一種有利可圖的手段，這也是本市現鈔籌碼缺短的主因之一。現鈔奇缺的結果，使市面上發生了貼水現象，至於由此而引起的本票及旅行支票等等的增發，自然更會擴大通貨膨脹的程度及其嚴重性。</p>
<p>上週暗息，做五角四分最爲普遍，少者亦在四角以上，其間甚且有高至六角者，至於市塲上爲數達廿五元的日拆，如以月息計，已經在七角以上，更是前所未有的。</p>
<p>國家行局，自週一至週五，計共差進一萬三千八百六十七億，但其間尚包括週四一天，央行向台灣銀行轉帳借進一萬億元，故五天內行局之實差進不過三千八百多億，由此亦可見所謂拋售物資云云，尚難與國庫支出的浩繁相匹敵。</p>
<p>但洋商銀行在一週內的進數却頗堪注目，自週一至過五計共差進五萬二千八百九十億，創空前差進之紀錄，從這裏亦不難看出資金的逃避仍在變本加厲中。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，頭寸普見參差不齊，過四以前，且普遍告缺，因此週四以前的同業拆放頗盛，週五則頭寸鬆弛，拆放銳减，六十號以後行莊交換結果，自週一至週五，計共差出六萬四千三百四十五億，即扣除台行轉借於央行之頭寸一億不計，間接交換亦差出達五萬多億，這樣的高數額，在過去也是罕有的。</p>
<p>內外匯率</p>
<p>上週本市行莊內匯匯率，普站高盤。穗匯匯水，自週一至週四，均爲四百五十元，週五稍落至四百元，厦匯匯水，一週內迭見上升，週一爲四百五十元，週二爲五百元，週五再升至五百五十元，這充份表示出資金南流的趨勢，本市資金，匯往華南，雖打上一個對折，亦在所不惜。</p>
<p>渝匯匯水，週四以前爲二百元，週五稍降爲一百六十元，漢匯匯水自週一之四百元升至週二之四百五十元，週五則降爲三百元。高匯水的另一意義，爲本市的物價，高於其他各埠，結果會造成物資倒流入大都市的現象。上週津匯，週四以前爲平匯，週五則又回復五十元之貼水。</p>
<p>結匯證價格，上週頗見波動，週一爲三百萬，週二三提升二十五萬；週四五又降至週一的水平了。香港申匯自週一至週四，已縮至法幣十萬元合港幣一角的比率，香港美鈔市價大致爲五元四角半，黃金每華兩則自三百廿四元七角半升至三百廿九元五角。</p>
<p>華洋股市</p>
<p>本週初，銀根仍呈鬆勢，華股市况，搜求殷切，人心相偕競進，躍登漲限者達十九種之多，永紗創見九四七五元新高價，較上週升八六〇元。過二因當局大量拋售物資，銀根全面猛緊，國家行局差　竟　三萬二千餘　之巨，股市遂呈風雲變幻姿態，在先永紗迭現高價，實創一〇三五〇元新價，美亞一度登五九五〇元漲限，旋轉軟化，急　直下，永紗臨收降落至九二〇〇元，一日間波動頗大。其他小股多半跌停板。週三因銀根堅勢未已，現鈔尤感緊絀，股市致有發生不能交割之現象，全面低度緩落，跌停者計有九種之多，永紗最低曾落至八五〇〇元，旋復稍升，以九二八〇元收市。週四銀根更形緊俏，紛紛跌停，永紗賴有廣帮維持，勉强托住在九千萬關外。週五因外埠游資大量湧到，銀根復趨鬆動，萎頓數日來之股市，遂呈全面煥發，散買活躍，永紗，美亞，信和，初開卽漲登限度，他股亦絡續隨升至限，計有二一種之多，較上日均升一成至二成。永紗全程祗做一〇〇五五元一價。</p>
<p>本週洋股仍未做開。</p>
<h3 id="c136">工商動態　自亂步調的諸種經濟措施 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>當局對於經濟金融方面的種種措施，往往表現出極不調協的步驟，此種前後不一致的步調，在當局果可無動於中，充其量，背上不够信用的稱號，但對工商界與一般人民，却又是如何重大的損失呵！茲就一週來若干事實，列舉於后；</p>
<p>（一）關於公用事業漲價問題，本月三日，中央銀行兪總裁向報界發表稱，穩定上海市公用事業價格問題，業經會商決定，即予施行，並說這是平抑物價之一種重要步驟。但即在同一日，吳市長已核准水·電·煤氣三項公用事業七月份的新價，計新價較上月份普增百分之一百七十五，接普公用交通事業亦於上過提高新價達一倍半以上。</p>
<p>（二）關於生活指數與裁員問題者，當局所公布六月份的生活指數，雖僅及該月份物價平均指數之半，但已較五月份生活指數漲起一倍以上，此種揹施，也可謂頗適合羣情最低的要求，而本市勞資關係的不致全面破裂，亦可謂得助於此項指數的繼續增加。但不意當局自己，先投身於勞資糾紛的漩渦中，按七日下午，公用局上海公共交通公司，即宣布解雇第廿一屆司機七十五名，及第十八屆賣票一百廿七名，造成了交通界的軒然大波，該公司全體內外勤工作人員一致同情聲援，致八日各綫公共汽車三百多輛都未開出，全市交通陷人半麻痺狀態。</p>
<p>（三）關於防止北方游資匯集本市問題，報載滬市當局已決定五項措施，其中第一項爲控制通貨緊縮信用，內分四項建議，其一爲建議中央限制提存並禁止商業行莊辦理申匯，其二爲限制普通携帶來滬之現鈔，不得超過二億元。但事實上，東北華北申匯均已開放，而央行兪總裁又表示開放申匯，目的在使正當工商資金得以匯兌，不問前後所持之理論孰是孰非，至少表示當局之決策舉棋不定，出爾反爾。</p>
<p>（四）關於美援物資分配及進口承辦問題，進口業方面本寄予莫大之希望，但據說美援物資中如棉花·烟草·柴·汽油。及其他各種器材原料，其分配僅及於少數工商及美商進口商，致引起進出口業方面極大不滿。並曾提出抗議。</p>
<p>至於美援物資進口問題，迄月前爲止，據說僅石油由石油公司辦理，而美援運用會沈熙瑞氏，又表示美援物資自美國或美屬地運華，因有許多技術問題，故必須由美進口商承辦。但華商進口商，自希望由自己辦理，假如這點不能做到，對本國工商界權益的犧牲必甚可觀！</p>
<p>（五）關於七季進口限額是否减少這一問題，本市進口業及工商界均極關心，照理說美援雙邊協定已經簽訂，而六月份出口結匯數字，已超過二千萬美元，亦創本年度出口結匯之記錄，則進口限額自能放寬，間接亦可促進出口之增加。現據悉七季限額不但不增，且將减少，對於甫告實行之新結匯辦法，未始不是一種打擊</p>
<p>（六）爲　補財政赤字起見，當局對出售國營事業，自亦不遺餘力。據悉政府已命令央行籌組銀團，以主持此事。又據佔價，出售國營產業約値五億美元以上，如能順利推行，這當然是一筆可觀的收入。但假如立院所提的臨時財產稅付諸實行，國營事業將無人承購，工業界亦決不欲爲購進產業而負擔高額之賦稅，可見兩種措施亦爲自相矛盾者。要之，局面愈混亂，當局比作的種種措施，亦將愈自亂其步調而已！</p>

<p>滬江大學創始於民國紀元前六年（西曆一九〇六年），原名上海浸會道學院與浸會大學，由在華美國南北浸禮會傳道士募資十二萬元購地一百六十五畝於黃浦江濱興建校舍。至民國四年始改稱滬江大學，民國十六年校董會依據政府公布私立學校校董規程正式改組，於十七年一月推舉劉湛恩博士爲第一任華人校長，進行立案手續，十八年三月奉敎育部令准予立案。二十年城中區商學院繼之成立。二十六年滬戰爆發，楊樹浦校址地處戰區，乃倉促遷入市區假城中區商學院繼續上課。廿七年四月七日，劉湛恩校長因爲國効勞忠貞不二，遭敵僞之忌，在滬被刺殞命，是爲抗戰以來我敎育界爲國犧牲之第一人。其後，該校仍在極度艱苦惡劣之環境中推行校務，與聖約翰之江及東吳等校合組華東基督敎大學聯合會，開辦聯合課程與圖書館，舉行聯合畢業典禮等，和衷共濟，充分表現基督敎之特有精神。三十年冬太平洋戰事爆發，敵偽進佔整個上海，因環境不變，不得已宣告停辦。同學會爲維持母校年久優良師資及　　學子之學業起見，乃接辦改爲滬江書院。同時重慶方面由美國創校人會及同學會等籌劃母校西遷在渝復校，翌年二月卒獲告成。初與東吳合組東吳滬江法商學院，及後之江大學加入，合組爲法商工學院。至卅四年抗戰勝利，滬江隨即在滬復校，卅五年四月中旬乃全部遷回楊樹浦校址上課。</p>

<p>金蘭甲組昨以九比六戰勝聯美，在甲組網球聯賽中保持全勝紀錄，第一循環除上星期四，因雨延期，尚待補賽外，本星期四將開始第二循環比賽。目前形勢如下：</p>
<p>昨日除金蘭聯美之役外，體運在恩派以十比五勝主隊，綠燈在本場以十三比二勝友聯。</p>
<p>金蘭聯美變方均俱堅强陣容，競爭至爲緊張，尤以第一對葉觀雄李國璠之擊敗于文正蔡國基組，最引人注目，而爲觀者所激賞，聯美因林寳華許培之朱出塲，實力大受影響，尤以第三組之失敗，吃虧最大。</p>
<p>第四五兩對先行開審，逆料聯美有能全得六分，但後四組余田光在第三盤之「盤點」，竟告失去，反失是盤，减少一分。第五對亦爲同樣情形，聯美各以二比一勝，積分聯美四金蘭二。第二對由李文成與劉德鱗配搭，陶冠球周冠軍凈得三分，積分成五比四，金蘭多一分。第三對登塲，陳亦力戰，惜吳敬學弱軟，被成爲攻擊據點，金蘭蔡魏連得三盤，積分乃成八比四。</p>
<p>第一對葉李上塲，一無是處，王蔡以六比二勝來易如第二三兩盤，葉李之高殺攔網，頗爲得手，以六比三，六比四連捷，總分遂成九比六。蔡國基之雙打表演最佳，惜發球時犯「脚誤」，與余田光之跳　，均須特別注意。成績如下：</p>

<h3 id="c163">一個汽車推銷員的故事 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 綠滿</p>
<p>隨意翻開一本美國新到的雜誌，你總是很容易找到許多五彩精印的廣告，而設計最精美，佔據的黨輻也最廣的，却往往都是汽車展告。福特汽車公司的廣告上常有一個西洋人占卜命運的水晶球，水晶球的旁邊有一句標語，叫做「你將來總要買一部福特車。」眞的，誰不想買一輛漂亮的汽車代步呢？</p>
<p>但是，在四十年前，美國的一般人們却還對汽車常常抱着懷疑的態度。那時候，馬路旣遠不及今日的寬闊平坦，汽車的本身也還沒有製造到完美的地步，因之中途「拋錨</p>
<p>是常事，修理起來也相當麻煩。推銷汽車，實在是一件吃力不討好的工作。</p>
<p>是，汽車推銷員也就大動腦筋，不斷地在窮思極想着推銷的「噱頭。</p>
<p>一天，洛杉磯的報紙上突然刊出了一段短短的廣告，說是「天氣暴寒，我家轎子園半數都已凍壞，損失浩大，不得不忍痛將汽車廉價出讓。」熱心而好奇的人們就到這不幸者的家裏去看看那輛便宜汽車，正好那位汽車主人口才極好，把那輛汽車的好處說得天花亂墜，結果就很迅速的就找到了買主。但是，後到的買客就向隅而退麼？却並不然。原來第二位想買便宜貨的買客來的時候，倒又有一輛舊汽車等在那裏了。結果是那一家人家賣掉了許許多多舊汽車，嫌了許許多多的錢。那位汽車主人年紀才二十歲左右，已經儼然白手成家了。他並沒有說誑，他家的後園的確有橘子樹，不過一共只有兩稞，在這次暴冷中，其中的一稞的確是凍壞了。</p>
<p>慢慢的，這位年靑的汽車掮客正式做了當地一家汽車公司的分公司經理，他格外熱心地推銷着各式新頴的汽車。但當地大多數的居民却還是嫌價錢太貴，雖然心愛，都捨不得拿出大疊的鈔票來買。那位經理先生靈機一動，又想出了一個花樣。他說，他出賣汽車，却不一定要顧客們出錢：顧客們可以用別的東西來和他交換。這一個辦法宣布之後，生意立刻興旺起來，居民們紛紛把自己的鑽石，馬，馬車，地產，果園……之類來向他換新汽車。——但是，這位經理先生把那些鑽石馬匹地產之類出賣的時候，得到的錢却遠比汽車的定價爲高。一個小花樣，不但推銷了無數的汽車，而且自已更大大的賺了一票。</p>
<p>但是，他的神通雖然廣大，偶然也不免總有失敗的時候。有一天，一個獸醫到他店裏，看中了一部舊的傑克遜脾子的車子。他要試車，但那位天才推銷員却心裏暗暗着急，原來這種一九〇五年出品的「老爺車子」是實在經不起多「試」的；但是爲了生意要緊，他祗好欣然答應，親自駕駛這輛汽車，送那位獸醫回家。不想吉人天相，那輛汽車竟然安全到達，並未拋錨。那位獸醫不禁大喜，就坐在自己的灶間裏預備簽訂買車的合約，但剛剛想寫下去，却忽然停筆，回頭問了一個令人難答的問題。</p>
<p>他說：「你的車子倒不壞。不過，讓我問你一個問題：如果買車的不是我而是你自己，你看這輛車子是不是値得買呢？</p>
<p>那位推銷員的心裏一跳。他還年輕，他亟望這筆交易能够成功，可以賺一筆他所急需的佣金。正在躊躇不決的時候，他抬起了頭，牆上掛着一個繡着字的橫幅。橫幅上是淸淸楚楚的這幾個字：</p>
<p>「上帝在諦聽着你的每一個字。」</p>

<p>近人楊雲史，曾爲吳佩孚私人記室，額其所居曰江山萬里樓。詩宗老杜，頗有絃外之音，予嘗見其咏促織三首，茲錄其一云：「亦知生世晚，物候已收蟬，池閣燈如水，關山雲滿天。數聲星欲曙，一客夜爲年，辛苦心何急，脊征孰爾賢。</p>
<p>龍陽才子易實甫，與樊樊山齊名，著有四魂詩集，卽魂東魂西魂南魂北是也。易幼有神童之目，聞七歲便能吟咏，惟詩境蕭瑟，豈窮而後工耶！如殘暑一詩云：」嗷嗷困殘暑，得雨易爲秋，鳴蛩如餘怒，寒蟬且復休，芡枯烟冪水，樹逈月明樓，向夕西風急，徘徊咏四愁。」</p>
<p>王禮錫乃江西人，爲當代名作家，嘗在神州國光社主編「讀書雜誌」，風行一時，抗戰初年，因代表全國文協慰勞前方軍士，不幸歿於中途。王能詩，予見有初秋偶成一詩云：「歲月催吾老，秋風又此身，蹉跎空負國，潦倒學依人！山柳垂眉蹙，林蟲入耳新，可憐軀七尺，祗是苦風塵。</p>
<p>劉半農博士，擅打油詩，自號日桐花芝豆堂主人，蓋言其桐子花生芝蔴大豆均可打油也。故其所作，多淺近易解。有自嘆一首云：一坐擁書城漫自誇，硯田筆陣豈生涯，天生我華本無用，絕似恒河一粒沙。</p>
<p>沈尹默，工絕句，所作淸麗婉轉，頗似唐之溫飛卿，如春日偶成云：　碧水流舟映晚霞，寒梅落盡又春華，深閨少婦樓頭望，怕見風欺楊柳斜。」</p>
<p>胡懷琛原名寄　，爲當年禮拜六派之健將，後見其族人胡適之提倡新文學，亦起而效之，「大江集一新詩，與胡適之之一嘗試集」相輝映。復創「小說革命軍」，惟影響極微。晚年任敎大夏持志等大學，窮愁潦倒而死。一生治文學史甚勤，往往廢　忘餐，嘗創論墨翟爲印度人，一時輿論譁然。歿後遺有「寄塵雜詩」多卷，未刋。予得有春雨一首云：「烟霧迷離不放晴，東風吹送杜鵑聲，一天花雨柴門晚，三月魴魚春水生，紫燕銜泥嫌潤滑，白雲出岫亦澄清，夭桃本是仙鄉物，墮落人間得失輕。」</p>
<p>廬隱女士出身北京女高師，其舊詩頗有根基。生平所作甚夥，惜均隨手散棄。予處存有悼菊一詩，署名黃英。詩云：「冉冉香魂夢見之，幾番腸斷曉霜時，黃殘令日凋憐速，貞白當年採悔遲。酒不澆愁惟有哭，花難紫笑悵無知，由來色相都成幻，忙煞騷人賦悼詩。」</p>
<p>林徽因，乃長民之女，嫁梁任公之子思成爲妻，固一當代女詩人也。予嘗見林之絕句云：「拒霜花發斷腸紅，心事微波宛轉通，欲放扁舟江上採，幾回愁雨又愁風。一委宛綺麗，可誦之作也。</p>

<p>「夏日炎炎正好眠」。但是，人倒底爲甚麽要睡覺呢？</p>
<p>答覆這個問題的人很多，但至今聚訟紛紜，未得定論。</p>
<p>最妙的是法國國立科學院的穆尼拉敎授（已故），他說空氣中有一種神秘的氣體．名曰「睡氣」，呼吸到了便要睡覺。他說「睡氣」在鄉村空氣中最多，所以也許是從植物中發生出來的。他曾屢次嘗試把「睡氣」拿來裝在瓶裏，惜未成功。</p>

<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>我每天差不多要　過十字街口好幾次，尤其在江西路一帶中區。在上午十時至下午五時左右，那一帶更見擁擠，往來的行人車輛，亂成一片。各人的目同中有各人走路的方向，雖有紅綠燈的管制，行人們依舊乘隙在車輛的狹　間穿過去。那時，他們向四處闖去的情形，不是「十」字式的，簡直是「米」字式了！</p>
<p>寫文章的人，好用「十字街口」來象徵當事者的徘徊歧途，不過就我在中區的十字街口以旁觀者的立塲看來，行人和車輪們來往時，沒有一絲的猶豫；相反地，他們都很堅定，認定方向走去，甚至近於執抝。一部斜刺裏駛來的三輪車，幾平將一個騎自由車的少年撞倒，少年急忙跳下軍來，破口大駡，而那輛三輪車却已遠去了。看來在「十字街口」徬徨的還祗是那些書空咄咄的空想家。實幹的人是全不把它當作一會事的。</p>

<p>敎次田君近爲處理學務來平，對客談話有數語甚風趣，且警醒。其言曰：「昔日先生管學生，如今學生管先生。」田君今爲敎育當局，早年則爲受敎育之人，撫時觸緒，蓋不勝今昔之感焉。</p>
<p>按吾輩受敎育時代，校中小風彼在所不免，無所謂學潮，亦無自治會之組織，各班各舉班長，有關公共之事，同學議之，班長陳述於當局。大抵一校之中，各本班敎員而外，與學生最親者一爲「敎務」，一爲「管理」。管理者之名或曰「齋務長」，「齋務監督」，及「監學」，現時則爲「訓導長」，「訓育主任」。因於學生品誼行爲食宿衛生諸事，有指導監察訓戒之責，如古之「保傅」與「師」同格，雖不授課，亦是「先生」，與「總務庶務」性質不同也。</p>
<p>舊時學生偶有要求，如不滿於課本，不滿於敎員，而致衝突，大率關於敎務居多，敎務處上則校長，旁則敎員，下則諸生，層層面面，俱費精神。而齋務處（或監察）則循例而行，並無特別煩心之處。而近二三十年，乃恰相反，校生有自治會，自治會議決罷課，敎員雖上堂而寂無一人，若議決游行，管理員惟瞠目一旁，莫之能阻。若在校外發生何等事故，或與地方當局有衝突及被拘留，則保釋也，慰問也，等等云云，則將應接不暇。故今之「訓導」，與昔之「監學　」，其勞逸之相去，乃不可以道里計。</p>
<p>「管敎」二字，從來相聯屬，舊時之學塾老師亦一敎」亦「管」，一身兼之。試觀「牡丹亭」鬧學一劇，陳最良因杜小姐到塾誤點，先將女子應當早起及關於女訓行誼之事誥戒一番，卽「訓導」也。然後講解詩經，先字句，後大義，卽「敎課」也。現代式之學校，人數多，組織密，故敎務與管理必須分工，然先生管學生總是一樣的。卽今之中小學校，依然如此，尤其是小學，先生之尊嚴，學生之服從，與當年無甚差異，惟專校及大學，則風氣劇變耳。</p>
<p>憶民國元年嚴幾道博士在北京就職大學校長，約集梁任公，在大禮堂對全校演說。嚴云：今爲民國，人民自由，載於約法，惟有兩種人無自由可能：一爲軍隊，一卽學生。理由是惟其有所不知，有所不能，乃入翠校求敎於師長，若自問所知所能，在師長之上，不服管束，則入校何爲？梁氏則以三點切囑：（一）服從，（二）靜謐，（三）機素；學乃有成，校不虛入。以上二大名流之言，今其爲明日黃花乎。</p>

Yesterday, the vanguard of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway had already reached Liulihe. According to military observation, the current situation is only the prelude to the war, and a decisive battle may occur at the end of this month or early August. It is also rumored that He Yingqin will come north to direct the war situation. Chu Xichun stated: "We are absolutely confident in the Pinghan Line battle. The main purpose of this battle is to annihilate the main force of the bandit army. The strongholds that are evacuated can be recovered immediately once the National Army arrives."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] The North China Suppression General Headquarters announced: (1) Strong units of the National Army launched a fierce attack on the bandits in the area west of Fangshan South Liulihe on the afternoon of the 17th.

Furthermore, the siege and defense battle in the suburbs of Xushui City also began at 9:00 PM yesterday. The bandit army used the 20th and 21st Brigades of the 7th Column to besiege the city walls. The National Army, relying on the fortifications of the city walls, is fully counterattacking.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 18th Dispatch] In the fierce fighting on the outskirts of Baoding, the 19th Brigade of the bandit 7th Column and nearly 10,000 troops from the 9th Military Region fiercely attacked various locations on the northeast outskirts of Baoding, including Nanbeichangbao and Taibaoying.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] There are signs that the North China bandit army is about to launch a full-scale offensive. Currently, the situation in Miyun, eastern Hebei, remains tense.

<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th Dispatch] Yesterday's evening newspaper reported that some usable U.S. military surplus tanks have been exported from the Philippines to the Chinese Communists at scrap iron prices. Philippine officials have expressed doubt about this report.

It further stated that intact anti-aircraft guns had previously been found in surplus ships purchased by Chinese people. Furthermore, the Philippine National Development Company announced that the Philippine government has never sold surplus tanks to the people, but stated that such weapons may have been transferred before the Philippine Surplus Property Commission took over the remaining materials on the Philippine Islands from the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission for sale. The evening newspaper exclusively revealed a certain source claiming that at least five combat-ready tanks have been purchased by a wealthy Chinese businessman and transported to China on a Soviet ship that recently left Hong Kong. It is also claimed that the Philippine Presidential Palace and customs officials have been closely monitoring this Chinese exporter.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th Dispatch] According to the spokesperson of the military here, after the bandits rushed into the urban area of Xiangyang on the night of the 16th, they engaged in fierce street battles with the defending troops.

It is not yet known whether the defending troops have safely broken out of the siege. However, according to multiple reports, the bandits, after entering the city to plunder supplies, have fled southwest towards Jiehuang. They do not seem to have any intention of occupying it for long. Currently, our reinforcements have arrived near Yicheng (Zizhong) today and are continuing to advance rapidly towards Xiangyang. It is expected that the threat in northern Hubei can be easily lifted. Furthermore, the personnel left in Hankou by a certain pacification office in northern Hubei held an emergency meeting today to discuss the future development of the war in detail.</p>

Changyuan and Yanjin county towns were recovered on the 15th, and the vanguard of Li Zhenqing's troops has approached Puyang. This surprise attack was swift, leaving the bandits with no time to evade. The 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns of the Chen bandits who crossed the river have effectively lost their combat capabilities. The main goal of the National Army is to attack the communist bandits' hollow tactics and destroy the bandit corridor of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th Dispatch] The remnants of the Chen bandits who fled from southwestern Shandong to the east and west areas of Dangshan were severely attacked by the powerful National Army advancing eastward.

On the evening of the 17th, a portion of the bandits, approximately a thousand strong, launched a harassing attack on Wand, but were repelled by the National Army. However, observing the bandits' movements, it seems that they are actively adjusting their deployments and attempting to take action against Jinan. However, the National Army has made preparations early on. Currently, the National Army surrounding Jinan, with Guo Dian in the east, Wand in the south, Changqing in the west, and Qinhe Sannan in the north, has completed the most solid defense works. The new airport being built in Jinan City also began on the 18th.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Political figures in the capital have the following reactions to the views reported by the Associated Press that some officials in North China believe that the CCP is about to split: (1) They believe that the government's policy of adhering to suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion will not change. (2) The CCP Central Committee resolved on the 10th of this month to agree with the resolution of the Communist International Intelligence Bureau condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party and began a new cleansing movement to review and liquidate nationalists within the Communist Party. Within the CCP, there is no shortage of people who have been influenced by the Yugoslav Communists' separation from the Communist International and their inclination towards nationalism, but there is no force to split the bandit party. (3) The CCP's response to the resolution of the Communist International is the final proof of the party's international espionage nature. People who have been deceived and made mistakes in the past, if they return to the embrace of the motherland and strive to save the country and build the nation, will naturally be welcomed by the government. (4) Since the constitution has been promulgated, the so-called "coalition government" is an act of opposing the constitution and disrupting constitutional government. In a constitutional government, no one can consider it.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th Dispatch] The main force of the bandit army's 4th Column, the 10th and 12th Divisions, stubbornly resisted in Da'anping, east of Anshan. The National Army launched a full-scale offensive at dawn on the 18th, and the fighting was fierce. By noon, the bandits were unable to hold out and fled towards Liangjiashan. In this battle, more than 400 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 70 were captured, and more than 100 rifles were seized. Furthermore, the National Army that captured Lishan (five kilometers north of Anshan) continued to attack the suburbs of Anshan City at dawn on the 18th. The bandit's 3rd Independent Regiment entrenched in Anshan was gradually shaken and is currently rushing to transport supplies south.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Army's southern advance group, on the left flank, swept the area east of Anshan from Tangheyan, northeast of Liaoyang, on the morning of the 18th and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the bandit's 11th Division in Qilingzi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th Dispatch] The development of the war situation in southern Liaoning will depend on whether the main force of the bandit army avoids battle and decides on a new situation. The National Army's goal is not to capture cities, but has achieved great economic success. Currently, except for the 4th Column in southern Liaoning, which was forced to retreat, the bandit armies in other areas are all in their original positions.</p>

The National Army suffered only 20 casualties, while the bandits suffered more than 3,000 casualties. This was a miracle created by the rapid advance of the army. The National Army often had such results when they first entered the customs.</p>

<p>Launching a Military-Civilian Cooperation to Rush the Harvesting of New Wheat</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] Wu Hantao, Chairman of Hejiang Province and concurrently Secretary-General of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters, arrived in Beiping on the 16th from Pan, to discuss the issue of remittances from the Northeast with the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Mr. Wu visited Commander-in-Chief Fu on the afternoon of the 17th to present the views of the Northeast authorities on saving the current economic crisis and the need for assistance from the North China authorities. Mr. Fu agreed to consider the matter and seek a proper solution that takes both sides into account. According to Mr. Wu's statement to reporters, the fundamental problem of the Northeast economy is the lack of food. In order to solve the food shortage during the period between the exhaustion of the old harvest and the arrival of the new, the Northeast authorities are currently launching attacks on bandit areas, with the military and civilians cooperating to help local farmers rush to harvest new wheat and simultaneously carry out purchases to make up for the food shortage. If the government's purchase of grain from newly recovered areas goes smoothly, there will be no shortage of military rations in the coming months, and the period between harvests can be safely passed. The lives of civil servants, teachers, and the poor will also not be affected by other purchases. (Please refer to page 6)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Ministry of Interior is undertaking the promotion of local systems and local autonomy after the implementation of the constitution. Regarding local systems, the ministry has been engaged in the compilation of various relevant regulations since the promulgation of the constitution. Basic regulations such as the General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy, relevant regulations such as the organization and election of representative assemblies and councils at all levels, the election and recall of provincial and county mayors, and the exercise of initiative and referendum rights have all been carefully planned and drafted into legislative bills, awaiting the completion of the legislative process for the General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy, after which other regulations can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The local systems established in accordance with the Constitution can be gradually implemented on a fixed date in accordance with regulations. Regarding the advancement of local autonomy, in order to take into account the actual environment, the implementation is being supervised separately in safe provinces and pacified provinces. In pacified areas, the focus is on improving local administrative efficiency, strengthening the powers and responsibilities of local governments, and reforming political ethics. In safe provinces, the focus is on consolidating the foundations of autonomy, organizing the people, clarifying household registration, and promoting the exercise of civil rights. In safe areas of pacified provinces, attention is still being paid to the promotion of local autonomy, such as the establishment of people's representative bodies at all levels. Except for the eight northeastern provinces and cities and Tibet, all provinces and cities in the country have established provincial and municipal assemblies and temporary assemblies. Various preparatory works for local autonomy after the implementation of the constitution are also being planned in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Large Denomination Banknotes Have Indeed Been Issued <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Although the relevant authorities have repeatedly denied the rumors of issuing large denomination banknotes, dismissing them as purely rumors, most people are unwilling to believe them deeply. This newspaper also published an article on the 15th, elaborating on the current situation and predicting that it would be realized in a short period of time. This is not because everyone has foresight and is able to speak accurately; nor is it because we have obtained any secret information and know in advance that this would happen. In fact, before each previous issuance of large denomination banknotes, similar routine articles were invariably published, and the result was that the stronger the denial, the closer it was to the truth. Therefore, everyone has long tacitly understood this type of denial statement and made a reverse inference.</p>
<p>Now, the issuance of large denomination banknotes has indeed been formally announced yesterday. The denominations are Customs Gold Units of 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 250,000, which are equivalent to legal tender of 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, and 5,000,000. The term "large denomination" can be said to be worthy of its name. At a time when cash is extremely scarce and credit is tight, these types of large denomination banknotes may indeed be needed. However, if the country's issuance policy continues along this path and refuses to make a decisive change, then as a result of the rising prices, there will still be a "need to issue banknotes of larger denominations to redeem the current banknotes." Before long, today's large denomination banknotes will probably become small denomination banknotes again. Therefore, we hope that the few promises made by Central Bank President Yu, who said that "the government has certain (measures) (for) reducing currency in circulation and stabilizing prices," are not just empty official rhetoric, but can be quickly realized.</p>
<p>When the Legislative Yuan discussed the general budget bill on July 2, the government authorities also formally stated that the total state budget for the second half of the 37th year, including the ordinary budget expenditure of more than 3,200 trillion yuan and the special budget expenditure of more than 5,900 trillion yuan. Ordinary expenditures will be offset by tax revenues and there will be a surplus, while special budgets will be offset by the sale of state-owned property and other means, and no additional currency will be issued in the second half of the year. In addition, legislators have also made important proposals to freeze the issuance of a balanced budget. Therefore, we also firmly believe that the large denomination banknotes issued this time should not be specifically for making up for deficits, but for the purpose of redeeming the current banknotes. As President Yu said, "The issuance of banknotes with larger denominations this time... only increases the face value of the banknotes and does not increase the amount of issuance." However, how exactly will the current small denomination banknotes be redeemed and destroyed? We hope that the authorities should have a definite plan and statement.</p>
<p>As for whether the issuance of large denomination banknotes will affect prices, it should be judged by whether or not the amount of issuance is indeed not increased. If, on the one hand, large denomination banknotes are issued in large quantities, and on the other hand, small denomination banknotes are not withdrawn, or small denomination banknotes of equal value are not withdrawn; then, judging from the quantity theory of money, the responsibility for affecting prices should not be entirely placed on the shoulders of "speculators." Even if they are accused of "disrupting the financial market" and "investigated according to law," I am afraid that the currency will still not be contracted and prices will not be stabilized. President Yu has served as Minister of Finance for a long time and has a deep understanding of the relationship between currency and prices. He should know that these words of ours are definitely not intentionally spoken on behalf of "speculators."</p>
<p>The foundation of a nation lies in credit. Confucius said, "A people without trust cannot stand," and also said, "If a person is not trustworthy, I do not know what he can do." On the one hand, denials are made with certainty, and the ink is not yet dry, and on the other hand, large denomination banknotes of 1 million and 5 million are suddenly issued. Although it is said that there is no deceit in war, and that in this period of military suppression of disorder, it may be appropriate to use tactics and quickly achieve success; but in the perception of the people, there are indeed regrets. In the future, if we encounter the same request from "responsible persons of the chamber of commerce and the banking industry that there is a need to issue banknotes of larger denominations to redeem the current banknotes," we believe that being open and honest with the public may also be a path of democratic politics.</p>
<p>President Yu also said in a written statement: "Recently, there has been a shortage of banknotes in various places, and industry and commerce are deeply troubled by the difficulty of turnover." This is indeed the current reality and a legitimate reason for issuing large denomination banknotes. However, finance values nature, and commerce values stability. Whether it is for issuing large denomination banknotes or for suppressing prices, all artificial means that suddenly contract or release, bordering on disrupting the market, should be avoided as much as possible in order to achieve the goal of "benefiting the people." Even if the political skills are very clever, after repeated performances, when the general public, based on past experience, is completely aware of the truth, their effectiveness may be limited.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Britain is Building Roads on the Border of Kang and Tibet, Started in Early Spring of Last Year, and Erecting Boundary Markers and Building Houses in the Kang Territory <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] Since this newspaper first published the news that Britain is building a highway on the border of Kang and Tibet, it has aroused close attention from the world. According to reliable reports from the Kangbao Security Command, in mid-April of the 35th year, more than a hundred people of mixed ethnicity, including Zayu, Langhuang, and savages, carried road-building equipment to the Deranma area on the border between Tibet and India, and proceeded toward Zayu. They were transporting it to Walong to build roads. At that time, Daran, from the top to Tangrongna (that is, the meaning of mountain), had been built, but the section from Tangrongna to Walong had not yet been built, and the section from Walong to Zayu was being built at an accelerated pace. It was also mentioned that a certain party had advanced to the border of Kemai County in Chayu line in January of the 35th year, erected boundary markers and built houses. Judging from their intentions, it seemed that they intended to use Chayu as a base to open up lines eastward to Yunnan, north into Xikang, and west through the Tibetan border to reach India. The difficulty felt by the local authorities is that the area west of the Jinsha River is the sphere of influence of the Tibetan side, and it is not easy to go deep into it. According to a report from the Yunnan Provincial Government, the two administrative bureaus of Deqin and Lijiang on the Yunnan-Kang border will be changed to counties for the purpose of prevention. The Pacification Headquarters has forwarded this to the Central Government for approval.</p>

<p>Lu Han Reports to the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th] Compatriots on the Yunnan-West border are moving to Burmese territory in large numbers. The Pacification Headquarters received a detailed report from Lu Han on the 17th on the reasons for the relocation: (1) In the seventh administrative region of Yunnan, in addition to the two counties of Simao and Ning'er, the administrative expenses of the other seven counties and bureaus of Zhenyue, Jiangcheng, Liushun, Ningjiang, Cheli, Fohai, and Nanjiao are all borne and apportioned by the people, which is more bitter than in other counties in the interior. (2) There are many instances of harassment by administrative personnel and local gentry. (3) The finances of each county are calculated in paper currency to the Provincial Department of Finance, while actual expenditures are based on cash; the Department of Finance has been ordered to rectify the financial expenses of the county level so that there is a certain amount and no temporary appropriations are allowed.

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 18th] Overseas Chinese merchants in various parts of South Korea are finding it difficult to maintain their businesses, or are even being forced to close down, due to extortion by South Korean police and local gangsters. After repeated negotiations by the Chinese Consulate General in Seoul with the US military government, the situation has improved slightly. In Seoul, for example, as many as thirteen local police agencies had the authority to search Chinese-owned stores in the past. In addition, there were six agencies, including the Central Price Control Bureau and the Police Department's Investigation Bureau. The so-called thirteen local police agencies, in addition to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, also included the twelve police stations under the jurisdiction of Gyeonggi Province, all of which had the authority to search stores at any time under the pretext of investigating black market transactions. Incidents of extortion and gangsters posing as police officers occurred frequently. After the consulate's negotiations, the search authority of these thirteen agencies has been unified. From now on, matters concerning the local police and overseas Chinese will be handled by the Metropolitan Police Agency (called the First Police Supervisory Office); at the same time, when officials from various police stations go to search Chinese-owned stores and residences, they must contact the consulate or be accompanied by consular staff. Night searches are also to be avoided as much as possible. As for the unification of the authority of the Police Department's Investigation Bureau, the central police agencies, and the six agencies of the Price Control Bureau, the consulate is currently negotiating with the US military government.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Merchants Find It Difficult to Survive</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 18th] Overseas Chinese merchants in South Korea are finding it difficult to survive, in addition to being extorted by unscrupulous elements in the South Korean police. The main reason is the unreasonable regulations regarding local import tax rates and the selling prices of goods. Import goods are taxed by customs based on market prices, that is, black market prices. However, before the goods can be sold, the Price Control Bureau sets price limits, and violators are severely punished. The limited prices are almost half the black market prices. More than one hundred Chinese-owned trading companies in Seoul have requested the consulate to find ways to protect them. The consulate is currently negotiating with the US military government, hoping that it will either levy import taxes based on the limited prices or raise the limited prices to achieve a balance.</p>

<p>Eliminating Bad Elements Such as Opium, Gambling, etc.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 17th] The more than 14,000 overseas Chinese in South Korea have implemented a "South Korean Overseas Chinese Autonomous Organization" similar to the Baojia system. It is likely that South Korea is the only place in the world where overseas Chinese have a sound autonomous organization. According to a reporter's investigation, there are currently 45 chambers of commerce in South Korea, as well as the Seoul General Chamber of Commerce. In areas with a chamber of commerce, there is also an overseas Chinese autonomous district office, as well as the Seoul General Office. This system was initiated by the Consul General in Seoul, Su Menggong, who also promoted it and took responsibility for guidance. It was implemented simultaneously in various parts of South Korea on June 15. The personnel of the autonomous district offices are generally elected autonomously by the overseas Chinese. The most important tasks of the district offices are to eliminate bad elements such as opium, gambling, and prostitution among the overseas Chinese, run adult literacy classes for overseas Chinese, assist overseas Chinese who have fled from North Korea to South Korea, report South Korean gangsters who impersonate overseas Chinese, copy domestic news broadcasts so that the general overseas Chinese population can understand the situation in their motherland, and register the movement of overseas Chinese in order to facilitate concentration in the event of an emergency. The organization of the various district offices has been approved by the South Korean authorities, and their connection with the consulate is even closer. According to Consul Su Menggong, more than 20 overseas Chinese involved in opium, gambling, and prostitution have been reported by overseas Chinese since this year before the establishment of the various district offices. After the consulate confirmed the reports, it forced them to return to their country.</p>

<p>At the start of the ceremony, Commander Wang Yaowu personally distributed awards and merit certificates to each "Combat Hero," and used the most accessible language to encourage everyone to be a "Combat Hero" and "not to be a bad seed." Following this, Division Commander Cao encouraged everyone, stating that today each brigade only has over seven hundred combat heroes, and he hoped that everyone would become a combat hero in the future, that everyone would have merit, and that they would become a "Hero Brigade" and expand into a "Hero Division." Afterwards, Mr. Yao, an inspector from the Ministry of National Defense, said: "A soldier's career is on the battlefield, and achieving merit on the battlefield is the greatest glory for a soldier. Comrades who achieve merit are role models for all of our officers and soldiers. Everyone should achieve merit and do everything with merit to eliminate the bandits and defend the country."</p>
<p>Finally, after a representative of the combat heroes gave a response, the ceremony came to a close. After the ceremony, the reporter interviewed over a dozen combat heroes. One of them, named Guo Sheng, was a 20-year-old light machine gunner. In the battle to attack the Yujiazhuang north of Longshan, he was the first to carry a machine gun under the cover of artillery smoke bombs and rushed to the front of the Communist bandits' bunker. Unfortunately, at this critical moment, the smoke screen dissipated. He saw the bandits, and the bandits saw him. The bandits fired at him with two machine guns. Fortunately, the bullets slipped past the sides of his legs, only scratching the skin. At this time, he used a volley of machine gun fire to defeat the bandits and then occupied the Communist bandits' trenches, killing five bandits. At this time, the squad leader walked over and saw the blood flowing from his legs, mistakenly thinking that he had been seriously injured, but he firmly said: "This is nothing, just a scratch." As a result, he was selected as one of the heroes of the company.</p>
<p>The second person was Yao Jun, 25 years old, from Fuyang, Anhui. He was a volunteer soldier. When he was defending Xiangchengzhuang southeast of Longshan, two battalions of bandits attacked his two squads. Because of the disparity in numbers and the fact that many brothers had died in battle, and the bunker was broken into by the bandits, in a moment of extreme urgency, he cleverly placed his machine gun on the door panel on the upper level of the bunker. He hid in the weeds inside the bunker in the darkness, and the bandits neglected to see him. At dawn the next morning, the bandits suddenly retreated, and he took out his machine gun again and killed over 20 bandits, and rescued the platoon leader who had been wounded by the bandits nearby, seizing three enemy machine guns and twelve rifles.</p>
<p>In addition, the reporter also interviewed over a dozen people, including Private Cao Jiacheng and Huo Lianzhong. Their heroic fighting spirit left the most profound impression on me.</p>
<p>The next item on the program was for everyone to sit on the ground in the square for a meal. The brigade headquarters specially set up honorary seats for each combat hero, with one guest accompanying each seat. When the reporter asked the combat hero at the same table why the unit could not fight in the past but can fight now, he told me that this was entirely due to the change in the past practices of all of the company commanders, the ability of everyone to share weal and woe, and the ability of officers and soldiers to achieve a real sense of unity in their lives. One of them even said bluntly: "We are not fools. If we are asked to risk our lives entirely to maintain or establish the interests of a few people, we will not do it!"</p>
<p>After the celebratory banquet, there was also a performance to comfort the troops. The reporter did not have time to participate due to time constraints. On the way back, Brigade Commander Qian Baiying told me that this celebration meeting was completely learned from the Communist bandits and had a significant impact on boosting morale. Now the slogan we are following is: "Look for the shortcomings of the Communist bandits to attack the enemy, learn the strengths of the Communist bandits to attack the enemy."

<h3 id="e66">Western European Union Five Foreign Ministers Meeting Today in The Hague; The Berlin Crisis Will Be The Topic of Discussion <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Our News] London 18th Broadcasting, the Berlin situation is becoming increasingly serious, the "Western European Union" five strong foreign ministers are scheduled to convene a meeting in The Hague tomorrow (19th) to decide whether to implement a showdown with the Soviet Union, or seek another way to open the Berlin situation. The United States will not send representatives to attend the meeting, but Britain will notify the United States of the meeting. The questions to be discussed are extremely delicate, so the party strictly keeps secrets. This meeting was originally a quarterly meeting scheduled by the five countries. The last meeting was held in March of this year, when the Brussels Treaty was signed. In peacetime, the scope of the meeting was limited to the progress of joint defense plans and obtaining US assistance. However, at present, because the Berlin issue has completely changed the goal of the meeting, it has shifted to how to open the Berlin deadlock and how to deal with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The most important chapter of the Western European Union will begin on the 19th when the foreign ministers of the five countries meet in The Hague. Before starting off, Foreign Minister Bevin said at Waterloo Station that he hoped that when he returned, he would obtain the military alliance treaty of the five Western European countries. Minister Pideault also stated at the Paris North Station that France would demand the recognition of the need to conclude a military alliance of five countries at the meeting in The Hague. In addition to Bevin and Pideault, those participating in the Hague meeting were Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Botsler, and Luxembourg Foreign Minister Beck. The first meeting was chaired by Dutch Foreign Minister Botsler. The main task of the meeting was to seriously deal with the long-delayed military alliance issue of the five countries. The permanent military committee of the five-nation alliance has completed a preliminary research report on the military alliance after secret discussions in London, which will be submitted for discussion at the meeting in The Hague. British Foreign Office officials revealed that Britain has also drafted a military draft treaty, which will be submitted by Bevin to the Hague meeting, and French Foreign Office officials said that France has also prepared a counter-proposal, which will be submitted by Pideault. In addition, the Hague meeting will also discuss the issue of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg assisting the Western powers with the airlift between West Germany and Berlin. It is reported that Holland is ready to supply a fleet of aircraft for the British to deploy. Although Mr. Attlee denied last week that he had requested the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to assist with the airlift, judging from the close relationship between the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg and the three powers' London negotiations, it can be concluded that under the current emergency situation, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will never act alone. Another issue to be discussed at the Hague meeting is the unification of Western Europe's colonial policies in Africa. The uranium in the Belgian-controlled Congo and French-controlled Madagascar, and the iron ore in Southern Rhodesia, may be utilized jointly by the five Western European countries. The detailed rules and methods have been drafted by the two committees in London and Paris, and will be submitted for discussion at the Hague meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Three Powers Continue Negotiations; To Issue Another Protest to the Soviets; Soviet Concern Rises Over American Superfortresses Flying to Europe <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The committee comprised of British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Strachey, U.S. Ambassador Douglas, and French Ambassador Massigli will begin daily meetings next week to monitor the Berlin situation. Simultaneously, they will study how to mobilize the military and economic power of Western allies to indefinitely maintain the Berlin airlift. The committee will also study whether the three Western powers must prepare for war over the Berlin issue, and what resources the three powers could mobilize in such a situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] Authoritative sources admit that convening a Four-Power conference to discuss the entire German problem is the only way to avoid a dangerous showdown with the Soviets over Berlin. Currently, the U.S., Britain, and France will remain silent, awaiting the outcome of the Western European Union's Five-Power conference in The Hague tomorrow before deciding on the next course of action to address the Berlin crisis. At this conference, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault will conduct a comprehensive review of the Berlin problem, seek the opinions of the Benelux countries, and then draft a reply to the Soviets.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The U.S., Britain, and France are preparing to issue a protest to the Soviet Union over the Berlin issue. Authoritative sources state that the new note might be completed by the end of next week. These sources say that the new note will meticulously refute Moscow's blaming of the Western powers for the Berlin blockade, but will simultaneously avoid any challenging language about breaking the blockade with forceful action in the near future. Officials believe this is particularly important, as submitting the dispute to the United Nations or an international court would allow the blame for threatening peace to be placed on the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the military strength of the Western powers in Germany is insufficient to back up any threatening words.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] According to political figures in close contact with the Soviet military government, the Soviet Union may send a squadron of Soviet Superfortresses to Germany in response to the American deployment of sixty Superfortresses to Europe. It is said that Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Government, Lukanchenko, Soviet Air Force Commander in Germany, Alexandrov, and other Soviet leaders in Germany held a meeting this morning in Karlshorst to consider the Soviet Union's countermeasures to the American action. Several senior Soviet officials stationed in Germany will fly to Moscow over the weekend to meet with Defense Minister Bulganin. Soviet sources in Berlin said that the arrival of American Superfortresses in Britain is more significant than any protest note, indicating that the Western allies are no longer just making political protests, but will demonstrate actual strength. The Soviet sources further stated that Soviet Superfortresses have the same firepower as American Superfortresses, but surpass the latter in range and speed. It is said that they were modeled and improved based on an American Superfortress that was forced to land in Manchuria in early 1945.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] During the ongoing Berlin crisis, the British government will request that Parliament remain in a state where it can be recalled at any time. Parliament was originally scheduled to conclude this session on July 30th. It is understood that due to the Berlin situation, Parliament will only announce an adjournment on that day. During the adjournment, the government can recall Parliament to reconvene within a day. If it were to convene another session, the King would legally be required to preside over the opening, which would take at least three days to convene.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Soviet Air Force Day: Grand Performance in Moscow <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The Soviet Union is using today, its Air Force Day, as an opportunity to declare that it will continue to strengthen its armed forces and air force, and to warn "warmongers" to recognize Moscow's strength, in response to the demonstrative action of a large number of British Superfortresses arriving in Europe. A large-scale air force exercise, including performances by jet fighters, air combat exercises, and parachute jumps, was held in Moscow on the 18th to celebrate Air Force Day. Moscow Radio reported Defense Minister Bulganin's address to the troops, emphasizing the unlimited development of the Soviet Air Force. The "Daily Chronicle," the official newspaper of the Soviet military government in Germany, specifically urged Germans to recognize the fact that the Soviet Union produces 40,000 aircraft annually. Titled "The Powerful Soviet Air Force," the newspaper instructed Western warmongers and Prussian military personnel to look at today's grand air force exercise in Moscow. An editorial in Pravda stated that the Soviet people are paying attention to the actions of warmongers, while continuing to strengthen their armed forces and air force as faithful protectors of their homeland.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Heavy rain in Berlin today has caused American aircraft participating in the airlift between West Germany and Berlin to cease operations. British aircraft, however, are continuing to land at Gatow Airport using radar-assisted blind-flying equipment. By noon, 80 British aircraft had landed in Berlin, carrying milk, flour, sugar, and other supplies. British military headquarters stated that no Soviet aircraft were detected in the Berlin air corridors today, likely due to the Soviet celebration of Air Force Day. Soviet aircraft performed flying displays throughout the Soviet zone of Germany today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 18th] The Soviet air force exercise originally scheduled for today has been temporarily canceled due to bad weather and postponed to next Sunday.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Czech Authorities Arrest Reactionaries; Fabricate Various Charges to Eliminate Dissent <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 18th] The people of Czechoslovakia are in a state of anxiety, awaiting the storm that has been brewing for weeks: a wave of arrests. On the evening of the 17th, the authorities unexpectedly announced that they had apprehended 79 "unhealthy" elements instigated by the United States, on charges of sabotage, terrorism, violence, and assassination. As a result, prisons are being filled. A joint statement from the Ministries of Interior and Defense accused the United States of sending spies and assassins into Czechoslovakia to "attack the people's democratic regime and serve the bidding of international imperialist reactionaries." It also warned the Czech people that enemies of the current regime "stop at nothing and resort to the most shameful crimes against humanity." Czechoslovakia is rounding up the opposition, generally accusing them of assassination, sabotage, and destruction. The head of the blacklist is a former National Socialist Party committee member accused of organizing an assassination squad, along with several former parliamentarians and leading figures from the National Socialist Party and the Catholic People's Party. The initial reaction of the Czech people to this is that "this is the beginning of the end for non-communist parties, and one-party rule will soon become a reality in our country." A month ago, the Ministry of Interior announced that it would try 55 arrested National Socialist Party members, with former Minister of Justice Prokop Drtina listed first. Drtina unsuccessfully attempted suicide after the coup and remains hospitalized. Drtina had previously uncovered a secret communist arms cache while in office, thus deepening his resentment, and four weeks ago, the Czech people marched in opposition to the communist regime, supporting President Beneš, further strengthening the Czech communist resolve to eliminate dissent.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 18th] "France-Soir" reprinted an article on the 18th stating that the Soviet government originally planned to arrest Yugoslav Marshal Tito, secretly transport him to Soviet territory, and then publicly condemn him through the Cominform. However, Tito received a tip-off in advance and was able to escape in time. The newspaper claimed that its information came from "authoritative sources in an allied secret organization." It also stated that "the Cominform, especially its director Zhdanov, decided to capture Tito for interrogation, even executing him without trial, but Tito was exceptionally vigilant, and the plotters suffered the consequences themselves." The article claimed that the Soviet Union sent an aircraft carrying Tito and Ranković to Moscow, while one Soviet agent and one pro-Soviet agent were already in Belgrade.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Premier Schuman told the National Assembly today that the maximum reduction in the defense budget that the government could accept was 8.5 billion francs. Amendments proposed by the Socialist Party and the Radical Party were unacceptable to the government, and the government would resign if either one was passed by the National Assembly. The cabinet held an emergency meeting this afternoon before the National Assembly resumed the defense budget debate in a tense atmosphere, and has likely decided to treat the amendments proposed by the Socialist Party and the Radical Party, or one of them, as an informal vote of confidence. The Socialist Party's amendment calls for a reduction of 12 billion francs in the defense budget, while the Radical Party's calls for a reduction of 1,000 francs, to express its impeachment of Defense Minister Teitgen. The effect of an informal vote of confidence is the same as a formal vote of confidence, but it does not have to wait 24 hours before being voted on, as required by the constitution. If the informal vote of confidence is not passed, the cabinet may also be forced to resign. The vote will be held on Monday.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Cairo, 17th, United Press] A ceasefire order for all of Palestine is now awaiting approval from Arab leaders. Arab leaders have expressed agreement to a ceasefire in Jerusalem. According to sources in Tel Aviv, after the Arab League leaders agreed in Lebanon to accept the United Nations order, Jerusalem began a ceasefire tonight.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] The Jewish radio station in Jerusalem announced that the Arab forces in the Old City of Jerusalem fired artillery and machine guns at 5:30 this morning, violating the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Reports from Cairo say that the Egyptian forces based in southern Palestine, including in locations such as Nitzanim and Gaza, will not comply with the Security Council's ceasefire order to take effect at 3:00 PM standard time on the 18th. The Egyptian front-line commander will not only disregard the Security Council's requests, but will also ignore the Arab Higher Committee's decision to accept the ceasefire. Egypt's influential Al-Ahram newspaper, declared in a headline, "Accepting another ceasefire is tantamount to declaring the death of the Arab world. The Arab world must take a decisive and final stand against the ceasefire resolution." Arab leaders will hold a meeting before the start of the ceasefire period to decide their final stance. As the Arab side remains hesitant, the Israeli army is prepared to lay down its arms and observe the ceasefire on time. The Israeli government formally notified the United Nations on Friday of its readiness to accept the ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok said in Tel Aviv today that he hopes the Arabs will not force the Jewish army to continue fighting. Since the Jerusalem ceasefire began at midnight on the 16th, the area has been silent. Jewish and Arab representatives met today under the leadership of United Nations representative Vigier to determine the demarcation line between the two armies.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Alabama, 17th] The Southern States' Democratic Party held a secret meeting here today to prepare to secede from the Democratic Party's policies in protest against the black civil rights platform passed by the Democratic Party convention. The chairman of the meeting, former Alabama Governor Dixon, described the plan to protect black civil rights as an unconstitutional effort to reduce white people to a second-class race, destroying the future of white people and their descendants. He also frankly pointed out that the sole purpose of this black civil rights plan was to obtain votes from northern black people. The convention's resolutions committee subsequently passed a declaration insisting on the principle of racial segregation, freedom to choose associates, and opposition to civil rights initiatives.</p>
<p>[United Press, Birmingham, Alabama, 17th] South Carolina Governor Thurmond accepted the presidential nomination on the 17th, leading the States' Rights ticket in the southern states.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Recent developments in the Japanese political situation have become more nuanced due to various instances of friction between the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party. The respective cabinet members from both parties have been giving political speeches in various locations since the 10th, and have now expressed completely opposing stances. The relationship of so-called friendly parties and the so-called policy agreements have become bewildering. Based on this deduction, the fate of the Ashida coalition cabinet has likely been decided, and its disintegration in the short term is undoubtedly certain.</p>

<p>Remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall declared today that although the United States has reached a stalemate with the Soviet Union on the issue of international control of atomic energy, it is still constantly striving to achieve it. Utilizing atomic energy for the benefit of mankind is an extremely important issue for humanity. It will be raised again for discussion when the UN General Assembly convenes in September.</p>
<h3 id="e82">To Reduce Burden on Japan, US Plans to Sell Japanese Goods to Europe; To Undertake a Portion of the European Recovery Program <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Officials at the headquarters of the Marshall Plan here said on the 17th that they have some hope of organizing direct exports from Japan to Europe to undertake a portion of the European Recovery Program. They said they are considering increasing Japanese trade and reducing the burden on American taxpayers regarding Japan. However, they acknowledged that in the near future, the prospects of directly selling Japanese goods to Europe are not as optimistic as selling Japanese goods in European countries' Far Eastern colonies. As the United Press learned last week, great attention is being paid to the latter matter. The theoretical basis for directly exporting Japanese goods to England, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the other sixteen countries participating in the European Recovery Program is: (1) These countries need goods and equipment; (2) Japan needs to export; and (3) The United States has already allocated $4 billion to pay for goods needed by Europe. It is generally argued that some of this amount can be spent in Japan, as this would reduce the amount of funds allocated by the United States to support the Japanese economy.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Prospects for the American Presidential Election (Part 1) <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[New York, airmail from July 9th] People in New York and Washington generally believe that there is little doubt that the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates, Dewey and Warren, will be victorious in the election. The day I arrived in New York from Paris, the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia had just begun. Public opinion across the United States has a very high opinion of Dewey's "emergence." Many American magazines and periodicals have used Dewey's photograph as the cover of their latest issue.</p>
<p>The reasons why the Republican Party will win in November are: first, Dewey's personal prestige in American society is unmatched by other politicians. The "New Republic" magazine, once edited by Wallace, stated: "Today, there is no one in the entire United States who does not know and admire the name of Thomas Dewey. His lofty political prestige and his skillful and sophisticated campaign tactics are unmatched by any other person." In the past, during Roosevelt's four terms as president, Dewey was the only one who could compete with him. Furthermore, Republican vice-presidential candidate Governor Warren's popularity and achievements in the West Coast are also praised by Americans. In the last California gubernatorial election, Warren was nominated as the sole candidate by both the Republican and Democratic parties. When I traveled to California in 1946, I met Warren and learned of his humble, meticulous, and simple style. In the past three years, the American Pacific coast has been booming and developing at an accelerated pace, and Warren's popularity and political achievements have also contributed to Dewey's victory.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Democratic Party has occupied the White House for sixteen years, and the historical mission of President Roosevelt's era has passed. After Roosevelt's death, the party split, and Truman's talent, courage, and prestige were insufficient to serve as the chief executive of a world-leading country. When I filed this report, the Democratic National Convention was still three days away, and a tumultuous "dump Truman movement" was brewing within the Democratic Party. New York Mayor O'Dwyer, in his capacity as an incumbent administrative official, loudly proclaimed: "Truman is not fit for reelection, and the Democratic Party should try to save itself." New Jersey, across the river from New York, was originally a Democratic stronghold. The state's "party boss" (referred to as a "party machine" in English), Hague, said: "If the Democratic Party nominates Truman as a candidate, it would be tantamount to handing over hundreds of thousands of votes in New Jersey to the Republican Party."</p>
<p>Another major "machine" of the Democratic Party is the Kelly-Nash machine in Chicago (Kelly and Nash were influential supporters of Roosevelt's campaign). The current boss of the machine, Arvey, recently rushed to New York and secretly plotted with Mayor O'Dwyer to carry out the "dump Truman movement." Arvey's ideal Democratic presidential candidate was General Eisenhower. This opinion was warmly supported by Roosevelt Jr. (the eldest son of former President Roosevelt), the head of the California Democratic Party branch. Roosevelt Jr. launched a large march in Los Angeles to "nominate Eisenhower for president," which aroused a warm response from the southern states (the Democratic Party's stronghold). Senator Kefauver also said that General Eisenhower should be the most ideal candidate. (Eisenhower has publicly refused to run for election).</p>
<p>Eisenhower's prestige could compete with Truman, but Eisenhower himself is not a member of the Democratic Party. Eisenhower himself often comforted himself as a "non-partisan person." In his statement declining the endorsement, he repeatedly mentioned: "I do not wish to belong to any party." According to people familiar with the inside workings of American politics, Eisenhower's political relationships have been closer to the Republican Party rather than the Democratic Party. From Eisenhower's personal point of view, it would be unwise to compete with Dewey this year (New York Daily News editorial). Recently, letters and telegrams have piled up in Eisenhower's office at Columbia University, where he serves as president, all of which are letters of "persuasion." In a letter replying to a veteran in Florida, Eisenhower said: "I plan to devote myself to the most interesting educational career in the next few years. I have decided to decline any political activities."</p>
<p>In recent days, Eisenhower's actions have been surrounded by news reporters and political groups. Eisenhower's every move has been the best lens for news. Last night, 5,000 people claiming to be Eisenhower's "admirers" shouted slogans not far from my residence at 60 Morningside Drive, the residence of the president of Columbia University, asking Eisenhower to run for president. Eisenhower waved his hand and repeatedly said "Good night!" "Please come to the school office to talk if it is convenient!" He still did not mention political campaigning.</p>
<p>Some Democrats still advocate nominating Eisenhower as a presidential candidate, regardless of whether Eisenhower agrees. However, some "dump Truman" people, such as Mayor O'Dwyer, are vigorously recommending Justice Douglas of the Washington Supreme Court. Douglas is a senior Democrat and belongs to the left wing of the Democratic Party, but his prestige is far less powerful than Republican Dewey. A large portion of the Democratic Party's "orthodoxy" is still trying to win Truman over, and their slogan is: "Unite as one, with one heart and one mind, don't create opportunities for the enemy party, don't let your strength be dispersed!"</p>
<p>If Eisenhower could change his mind, then Eisenhower would be a formidable opponent for Dewey. But as it stands, Eisenhower will definitely not "emerge" to save the Democrats. Then Truman will undoubtedly remain the Democratic presidential candidate. If so, it will create an even more favorable opportunity for Dewey. The Republican Party may achieve an unprecedented overwhelming advantage in November.</p>

<h3 id="e84">President of the National Bank Officially Announces Immediate Additional Issuance of Four Types of Customs Gold Notes; Denominations of 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 250,000 <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>President Yu of the Central Bank gave a speech on the afternoon of the 18th, declaring: "Recently, there has been a shortage of banknotes in various places, and industries and businesses have felt difficulties in circulating capital. This bank has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from various parties requesting the issuance of banknotes with larger denominations. Responsible persons from the local chamber of commerce and the silver and money industries have also made the same request. At the same time, due to the recent surge in prices, the current denominations of banknotes are inconvenient for the public to purchase goods and carry them. There is also a need to issue banknotes with larger denominations to redeem the current banknotes. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of this bank, we will immediately issue banknotes with larger denominations, including four types: (1) Customs Gold 10,000 yuan, (2) Customs Gold 25,000 yuan, (3) Customs Gold 50,000 yuan, and (4) Customs Gold 250,000 yuan, to meet the needs and facilitate redemption." Yu also stated: "The government has a comprehensive plan to contract the currency supply and stabilize prices. The issuance of banknotes with larger denominations this time is purely to facilitate the people and meet practical needs. It only increases the denomination of banknotes and does not increase the amount of issuance, so it should not affect prices. If speculators use this to spread rumors in the hope of disrupting the financial market, they will be investigated and punished according to the law."</p>

<p>Selling Off Materials and Tightening Credit</p>
<p>The long-rumored large-denomination banknotes are set to be released today. To prevent speculators from taking the opportunity to spread rumors, raise prices, and harm people's livelihoods, the financial authorities have been in contact with various parties to exchange ideas for days. Although yesterday was a regular weekly holiday, Yu Hongjun, Wu Guozhen, Liu Gongyun, and heads of relevant agencies were in frequent contact. They have devised concrete and effective measures to suppress prices and tighten credit, which will be implemented starting today. Organizations such as the Yarn Control Committee will also sell off large quantities of materials such as cotton yarn, cloth, and sugar to increase market supply and vigorously tighten credit. In addition, the security authorities will severely punish those who spread rumors, raise prices, and manipulate the market in accordance with the Emergency Measures for Disrupting Financial and Economic Order during the Suppression of Rebellion.</p>

The Central Bank and various agencies owning materials will also sell off goods at any time depending on the market situation to curb the rising trend.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters Joint Meeting of Cadres: Chairman Fang Proposes Ideas for Reforming Party Affairs <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Kuomintang Central Committee's Review Meeting on Reforming Party Affairs is about to be held. The Shanghai Municipal Party specially convened a joint meeting of cadres at Huzhou Society on Guizhou Road at 9 a.m. yesterday to provide ideas for reforming party affairs. More than 800 people attended, including all executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, committee members of various district (branch) party headquarters, and cadres at all levels. Chairman Fang personally presided over the meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious.</p>
<p>Seeking Progress and Unity</p>
<p>In his speech at the meeting, Chairman Fang first analyzed the current unstable phenomena in society in detail, and urged party comrades to work hard to alleviate the people's suffering. He then put forward the principles of reforming party affairs, explaining that the Kuomintang is a political party with 60 years of glorious history. Today's reform aims to seek progress and unity, so that it can continue to strive for the new life of the party under the leadership of a unified organization and a single leader. Any reckless division will not be tolerated. Fang then pointed out with a tone of regret that party members in politics, once they become officials, only know how to be officials and forget that they are party comrades; they only know bureaucracy and forget the Three Principles of the People, causing many members of the party to be slandered. Therefore, in the future reform of party affairs, party headquarters at the same level should have the power to remove party members in politics at the same level.</p>
<p>Reform Should Be Thorough</p>
<p>After Fang's speech, cadres at all levels took the floor enthusiastically. The main points of their speeches are summarized as follows: (1) The task of reforming party affairs cannot be completed by a few central committee members alone. The will of all party members must be solicited. Therefore, the central government should be requested to convene a national congress as soon as possible to review party affairs and seek genuine reform. (2) The government should be requested to implement the program of the Principle of People's Livelihood to achieve equalization of land ownership and restriction of capital. (3) This reform should be thorough, avoiding bureaucratic style and preventing those who use the name of reform to engage in other attempts. The meeting adjourned at around 12 noon.</p>

These were canceled after the city fell into enemy hands. Recently, the employees plan to make a request to the companies to restore the rice subsidy and educational subsidies. The employees of the telephone company, etc., have initiated discussions. However, the companies' burdens have increased sharply in recent months, and they have no profits. In fact, it may be difficult to do so.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The "Express Train," the most complete, newest, and fastest train in the history of Chinese railways, named by Minister of Communications Yu himself, has been completed yesterday after more than a year of hard work by the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the two railway bureaus. The entire train is scheduled to depart from the Qishuyan Factory at 5:20 a.m. this morning for a test run, arriving in Suzhou at 6:20 a.m. After stopping for five to ten minutes, it will return to the factory at 7:30 a.m. The various parts of the machine will be subjected to a strict and thorough inspection again. If the results are good, another test run to Shanghai will be conducted tomorrow morning, either in the early morning or late at night. If the test run results are completely satisfactory, it can be officially added to the Beijing-Shanghai line on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>Traveling Between Beijing and Shanghai, Only Stopping at Zhenjiang and Wuxi</p>
<p>For the addition of this train, the Railway Bureau has specially adjusted the entire line's train schedule. The upbound express train (Train No. 202) departs from Shanghai North Station at 7:30 a.m., stopping at Wuxi and Zhenjiang along the way, and arriving at Nanjing Xiaguan Station at 12:30 p.m. The downbound express train (Train No. 201) departs at 6:00 p.m. and arrives at Shanghai North Station at 11:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Ticket Prices</p>
<p>After repeated consultations among the heads of various departments of the Railway Bureau, the ticket prices for the express train were drafted by the Transportation Department yesterday. Shanghai to Nanjing is 6 million yuan, to Zhenjiang is 5.72 million yuan, and to Wuxi is 3.95 million yuan. The Transportation Department immediately submitted this ticket price to Director Chen Bozhuang for final decision on the same day.</p>
<p>Factory Director Gao Talks About the Reasons for the Delay</p>
<p>According to Gao Zhenzhou, director of the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory, the air-conditioning equipment, comfortable chairs, radios, and paint of the observation car of the train were all completed at 5:00 a.m. on the 15th of this month. However, the generator that supplies power to the entire train's air conditioning broke down, so the factory departure period had to be postponed. The new generator was just shipped from the United States a few days ago and replaced. It was rushed to be installed and completed day and night, and the power generation performance was very satisfactory. Therefore, the air-conditioning part should no longer have any problems.</p>
<p>Train Hostesses Provide Services on the Train</p>
<p>For the train attendants on the express train, the Railway Bureau has specially selected the most outstanding personnel and subjected them to strict training. Five "train hostesses" were also tried out to serve in the observation car's bar and dining car. The Railway Bureau had very high standards when recruiting. It is said that all five "train hostesses" are high school graduates. The selection of women as train service personnel is an innovation this time, and it is expected that "train hostesses" will become a new profession for women after "air hostesses."</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Stocks denominated in Taiwan dollars will soon be listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A certain state-owned industrial and mining company in Taiwan has a large scale, with more than 40 units including coal mines, textiles, steel, and other industries. The development of its business is also quite smooth. Steel production has doubled compared with the Japanese colonial era. However, due to the lack of capital in Taiwan Province, loans from national banks are not a fundamental solution. A plan has recently been formulated to issue 30% of the company's shares for public listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This plan will soon be approved by the Taiwan Provincial Government, and then submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval for listing. It is also said that this kind of Taiwan dollar stock has been printed in Shanghai. Because it is calculated based on the value of 1945, the face value is not large. However, because the value of Taiwan dollars is adjusted from time to time due to rising prices, it is expected that the market for this kind of stock will be good after listing.</p>

<h3 id="e100">The Miserable "Shanghai Young Master": Bowing His Head Before the Price Surge Waking Up From a Luxurious Dream and Starting to Taste the Bitterness of Life <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] For decades, Shanghai has always been the gold rush and entertainment district in the minds of the public. It seems that anyone can easily start from scratch and live a carefree life as long as they mess around in this city for two years. Look at the people weaving back and forth on the road. Aren't there many standard "young master" types striding forward? The definition of "young master" is quite difficult to explain. Anyway, he is elegant, knows a little bit about human relationships, has a mind for dealing with the world, and has enough food at home to last a few days. At least, in the eyes of ordinary servants, he is always a "young master."</p>
<p>The rapid disappearance of the golden age of Shanghai young masters has only happened recently. Several intense price surges in a row have destroyed the foundation for carefree enjoyment. Young masters have only begun to taste the bitterness of taking every bit and using it like mud. According to statistics: cinema revenue has plummeted after price increases, and upper-middle-class Western clothing stores are desolate. Also, night gardens and dance halls are completely relying on middle-aged and older people to prop up the scene. Now the young masters are already powerless.</p>
<p>What the young masters find most heartbreaking is that movie tickets have increased to 2 million. What kind of mass entertainment is this? Let's line up to buy tickets at a limited price. What a long line! If, by chance, you encounter your nemesis and your lover gracefully arrives, then your face will be lost, and what will you do? After careful consideration, the result is to buy a synopsis and read it carefully. Understanding the plot can also be a consolation. But walking out the door, the luxurious scenes on those advertisements are really tempting, making people feel discouraged and weak all over. Calling a pedicab, asking for 300,000, the young master faintly bargained for half the price. The pedicab driver more faintly replied: "I can't afford to ride it! Let's walk!" What? Can't afford to ride it? This insult made the young master feel too embarrassed.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many more embarrassing things! Young masters have rarely gone to dance halls recently, but they can't help but go occasionally. It is said that the tea fee has exceeded 1 million. The courage to summon a dance girl to sit with you suddenly disappears. Two well-known waiters still compete to show enthusiasm: "Young master, Zhenzhen is calling you!" Really, isn't Zhenzhen also showing you a tempting smile? But why is she so entangled with ordinary old men? Just like in the past, she was by your side. The melody is leisurely, and the scenery of the dance floor is no different. The past is not necessarily a dream! Several price surges have made the young masters bow their heads.</p>
<p>It's Difficult to Add New Clothes; Old Clothes Stacked in the Trunk</p>
<p>If the price surge only revolves around the entertainment sector, the young masters can still endure it as much as possible. But in fact, clothing and food expenses are also constantly challenging the young masters' appearance. Vitamin supplements costing tens of millions have not been taken for a long time, and even a bowl of pork rib noodles costs 600,000. Malnutrition, dull complexion, what about further studies? What about work efficiency? Where do you start talking about it! A Western suit costs 300 million. From head to toe, if you want to look neat and tidy, it will cost 600 million. The young masters can't prepare new clothes, but the old clothes are indeed quite impressive. Before going to bed in the evening, take them out of the trunk, one by one, carefully folded. Thinking of the grace and demeanor that he had adorned with these clothes in the past few years, he pointed to the box and said to the maid: "Don't look down on it. This little fortune was enough to open ten banks before the war!"</p>
<p>One evening, a young master came to a fortune-telling stall near the Great World. He told the blind gentleman that he was indeed a "young master," with deep ancestors and a small fortune. But in the recent price surge, he was also stretched thin. So he wanted to calculate when the price surge would subside. The blind gentleman was startled and quickly shook his head: "This is a catastrophe! You can't calculate it." The young master didn't seem to be used to hearing the word "catastrophe." He laughed and said: "At least the young master doesn't do it, isn't it the same as being a street runner for speculative bosses and a guide for underwater divers?"</p>
<p>How Can You Bear to Come Back to the Old Place Again? All are Worried About Firewood and Rice</p>
<p>A gardener in a park in the West District once witnessed this fact: A pair of lovers appeared in the depths of the lush forest last spring. The man was a "young master" from a certain family near the park. They snuggled together and lingered all day long. They got married in less than a month. It is a matter of course for a "young master" to get married. There is nothing to discuss. But he went on to say: The night before last, they brought their child to the park again. This was the first time this year. They still sat in the old place. As soon as they sat down, the couple quarreled. The center of the quarrel was originally to save expenses. This scene is sad enough to imagine. Gentle love, how long ago? The sound of bamboo and the new moon are still like those of the year, but after several price surges, the Shanghai young master collapsed so sadly.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Theater Industry Has Difficulty Maintaining Operations: Hoping Military Personnel Will Understand Business Difficulties Theater Business Association Expresses Opinions <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In the case of a soldier throwing a grenade at the Grand Stage and the Co-Stage theaters a few days ago, the business of theaters throughout the city has suddenly declined. According to the Shanghai Theater Business Association, the theater industry was originally in a state of collapse due to market turmoil, reduced audiences, and increased prices and expenses. However, they have been trying their best to support it and temporarily prolong their breath. In recent years, they have been constantly disturbed, and they deeply feel the difficulty of doing business. They are grateful for the maintenance of the authorities, the sympathy of all parties, and the assistance of all parties, so that they can barely maintain it until now.</p>
<p>However, such a major unfortunate event happened again yesterday, endangering the safety of employees and audiences. It is really impossible for the industry to survive. The city's one hundred and dozens of theaters feel the seriousness of the danger, and they all advocate immediate closure due to the difficulty of doing business in the future. Yesterday afternoon, the association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors, saying that at a time of suppressing rebellion, a complete closure would inevitably affect social tranquility. They strongly urged their colleagues to take the overall situation into consideration and continue to operate as usual. The loyal and brave soldiers have been fighting hard and bathing in blood, which they have always admired. However, it is not easy for merchants to make a living. They hope to understand the difficulties of merchants and give them more maintenance, so that the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the city who depend on the theater industry will not be interrupted, and citizens can obtain legitimate entertainment." According to the industry association, "The prices are so high now, the industry's expenses are huge, and it is difficult to maintain operations. The cost of living index for the first half of the month announced a few days ago has increased by almost double compared with the past. The salary issued to employees alone is difficult to bear, and it has already been on the verge of collapse and cannot withstand accidents." The industry is also deeply grateful for the temporary suppression of the military, constabulary, and police this time.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Bookbinding Workers Strike Yesterday, Demanding Change to Base Salary System <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The bookbinding workers in this city started a strike yesterday. The reason is that the workers' wages have not been calculated according to the cost of living index, and they only get between 4 million and 5 million yuan per month, which is really difficult to maintain life. The Municipal Printing Industry Union has sent letters to the industry association twice, requesting that the base salary be changed to 35 to 40 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index, but the management has ignored it. Therefore, the workers are indignant and have started a strike. The union will submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Shanghai Nurses: Diligently Battling Death Day and Night, Reclaiming Lives from the Brink <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Municipal Police Department's Fire Brigade operates an emergency ambulance corps for citizens, which people have nicknamed "Shanghai Nurses." Using five ambulances as the backbone, each vehicle is equipped with one nurse, three police officers, and one driver. A doctor serves as the central command. The diligent service of these public nurses has snatched many lives from the hands of death.</p>
<p>On this particular day, the "Shanghai Nurses" first went into action at 2:03 AM. In the Fire Brigade building on Henan Road, the telephone with the number "18600" rang especially loudly in the quiet night. The alert officer on duty answered the call. In less than a minute, a white ambulance sped out. The call came from Minsheng Company at 378 Dongda Road. The ambulance raced through the quiet streets shrouded in darkness and quickly arrived at its destination. The victim was a worker named Wan Xiaobao, whose foot had been crushed by a copper box. His left big toe was completely fractured, and he was bleeding profusely. This type of injury was considered minor by the "Shanghai Nurses" staff, who had seen much worse and rescued many injured and ill people on the verge of death. They effortlessly lifted the worker into the ambulance, washed the wound with gauze and cotton, and bandaged the injured foot with a triangular splint and tourniquet. Meanwhile, the ambulance was already heading towards the nearest Shanghai Health Sanatorium. After arriving at the hospital, they handed the patient over to the hospital staff, thus completing their first mission. The ambulance returned to the Fire Brigade in the still-silent streets. Faint moonlight began to appear in the previously pitch-black sky.</p>
<p>Spending Time in Tension From that moment on, the "Shanghai Nurses" spent their busy day constantly in tension. At 5:20 AM, a section member at the Jiangwan Police Sub-bureau suddenly had a relapse of an old illness, but by the time the ambulance arrived, he had recovered and refused to go to the hospital. The "Shanghai Nurses" had made a wasted trip. At 6:44 AM, a Mr. Shen on Raul Road fell from a building, injuring his face and deeply lacerating his nose. He was constantly dizzy, so the "Shanghai Nurses" took him to the Red Cross Hospital. At 6:56 AM, a Mr. and Mrs. Jia on Guangxi Road were stabbed by an enemy with a knife. The man lost too much blood and was unconscious, while the woman was only slightly injured. Both were sent to Renji Hospital. At 7:41 AM, a Mr. Zhuang at the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Yuyuan Road was riding a bicycle and was run over by a truck. By the time he was taken to the hospital, his heartbeat and breathing had stopped, and resuscitation was unsuccessful. At 8:45 AM, someone on Bailinan Road had abdominal pain and vomiting. At 9:15 AM, someone on Jianguo Middle Road fell from a roof. At 9:34 AM, a house collapsed on Fangbang Road in Xiaodongmen, injuring people. At 9:54 AM, someone on Beijing East Road was vomiting blood. At 10:45 AM, someone on Beijing Road suffered a sudden illness. At 1:00 PM, someone at 119 Zhaopu Road called for the "Shanghai Nurses," but by the time they arrived, the patient had already been taken elsewhere. At 1:39 PM, a member of the Hongkou District team, surnamed Song, suffered from acute appendicitis. At 2:40 PM, there was a fight at Longhua Temple, and a Mr. Ye suffered a chest contusion with possible fractures. ... At 5:38 PM, a young boy surnamed Weng on Huiming Road was bitten in the left leg by a dog ... At 7:12 PM, a boatman on the Suzhou River was scalded by boiling water ... At 8:15 PM, someone in a hotel near the Great World took poison ... At 11:18 PM, a navy soldier at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road was hit by a tram ... The final call of the day was at 8:20 PM when a resident named Xue Xingsheng on Maigen Road and Tokyo Road had drunk too much alcohol and was unconscious. The "Shanghai Nurses" took him to Hongren Hospital.</p>
<p>First Aid Given in the Vehicle Similar to the emergency rescues of that day, the "Shanghai Nurses" regularly provide free service to citizens. Their staff works in shifts, day and night. As soon as they receive a call, they drive the ambulance to pick up the injured or ill person, bandage and apply medication for first aid in the vehicle, and then transfer the patient to the hospital, entrusting the patient to the hospital before completing their mission. In July, they have to go out thirty-three times a day. From 1934 to June of this year, they responded to a total of 10,067 emergency calls, rescued 10,356 people, treated 1,628 epidemic cases, and rescued 1,675 people. What they are fighting for is time. If you see a white ambulance with the telephone number "18600" painted on it speeding through the crowded streets with its siren blaring, this is the "Shanghai Nurses" doing their duty for the citizens.</p>

<p>Australian Officials Shoot and Kill Four</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sydney, 17th] On Nauru Island, an Australian territory located west of the Gilbert Islands on the equator, a conflict occurred between Chinese laborers and Australian officials. The officials opened fire, resulting in the immediate deaths of two Chinese laborers and two others who later died from their injuries. The Chinese laborers were hired to work on the island for a period of two years. Recently, their term expired, but the laborers refused to board the ship to return to China. They set up barricades and armed themselves with shovels, axes, sticks, and other weapons, and threw stones at the Australian officials. The officials ordered them to lay down their weapons, but they refused and instead charged towards the officials. The officials first fired shots over the heads of the laborers, but this failed to stop their advance. Chaos ensued, resulting in deaths and injuries. There were a total of 1,500 Chinese laborers serving their terms. Australian Overseas Minister Walter declined to comment on the matter before receiving an official report.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Heroes on Heroes' Slope: Kuling's Two Thousand Sedan Chair Carriers Support the Crown of Summer Resort <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liu Wenqu</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Kuling, 15th] In the sweltering heat, even the comfortable Shanghai-Kuling联运 (Lianyun) bus cannot resist the scorching power. Nanchang is one of China's four hottest cities; by 7:00 AM, one is already sweating profusely. Jiujiang at noon is somewhat cool. Taking a car to Lianhua Cave brings a slight breeze. Only ten or so miles away from the summer resort, I thought to myself, "In two hours, what can the heat do to me!" Choosing a mountain sedan chair, I broke through the encirclement of the chair carriers, stepped in, and watched the carriers start. The swaying chair poles gave a slightly light feeling, and my heart was full of longing for the coolness of the mountain - but it wasn't to be.</p>
<p>Eight Shoulders Carrying One Person Climbing a mountain is not easy. "A summer resort" is not easy to ascend. Now, eight feet have replaced two, and eight shoulders bear the weight of a hundred and several dozen pounds and the responsibility for one person's safety. The chair carriers' outfits are mostly the same: bare backs (only a very few wear short jackets), a strip of white or blue cloth draped over their shoulders, rubbing the flesh of their right shoulder (which must be switched to the left shoulder after a while) against the stiff carrying pole. A black or blue cloth belt is tied around their waists, and the trouser legs are rolled up. They are barefoot, wearing a pair of straw sandals. Their chests, backs, arms, and thighs are bronze-colored, showing health and strength. They are all young men in their twenties and thirties, but as soon as they lift the chair and take big steps, sweat immediately appears on their backs, turning from the size of rice grains to the size of soybeans. Unable to stay, it carves gullies on their backs, rolling down, wetting their waistbands, trouser legs, and straw sandals. The person sitting in the chair is exactly facing this scene - personal happiness built on the suffering of others! The hoped-for enjoyment of coolness and the appreciation of the mountain scenery are dispelled by this scene. Watching the chair carriers sweat, feelings of sympathy and pity arise in one's heart, and one cannot help but feel hot.</p>
<p>Nearly two thousand chair carriers support the crown of Kuling as a "summer resort." They replace the stream of visitors in sweating profusely, and they exchange the intense heat for the coolness of the vacationers.</p>
<p>Sweat Not Wasted Of course, the chair carriers' sweat is not wasted, and their lives depend on their shoulders and legs. The current price for a mountain chair from Shuhua Cave to Kuling is 5.8 million yuan. Passengers weighing more than 160 pounds require two additional chair carriers, costing an additional 2.9 million yuan. Out of the 5.8 million yuan, 1 million yuan is for medical expenses for the chair carriers who were beaten and injured in the previous strike. Each chair carrier receives only 970,000 yuan, with the rest going to the management fee of the administrative bureau. Due to the large number of chair carriers and the lack of overly enthusiastic tourists, it is lucky to be able to take one turn a day, going back and forth thirty miles, earning 970,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Unresolved Old Case Generally speaking, the chair carriers of Kuling are divided into two gangs: one is the local gang, with approximately 1,400 people, and the other is the Hubei gang, with approximately 500 people. The strike in early July was initiated by the local gang. The administrative bureau wanted the Hubei gang to maintain transportation, and the local gang took their anger out on the Hubei gang. When they were eating, a sudden attack came. The Hubei gang chair carriers were "sitting at home when disaster fell from the sky." A whirlwind of violence resulted in seven seriously injured, over twenty slightly injured, and two missing. The case is being heard by the Jiujiang District Court and has not yet been resolved. This is just a chance event. After the incident, the two sides did not seem to harbor any hatred, and transportation between Lianhua and Kuling was restored. They shouldered the heavy load again.</p>
<p>From Summer to Autumn Living fills the days, and they continue to climb up and down, carrying vacationers to visit scenic spots. It is easy for a single man to get by, but most of them have families, wives and children, living in Lianhua Cave, relying on their shoulders and legs to support them. "Living expenses are high, and a pair of straw sandals costs 50,000 yuan!" This is their catchphrase.</p>
<p>The best time for business is from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM, when they can make three round trips. But that is rare in a summer. Being able to carry the chair twice will attract countless envious glances. If one does not get a turn once a day, one can only blame bad luck.</p>
<p>In a summer, there is generally no shortage of business. Vacationers throw large amounts of money at Kuling, and the chair carriers also share a portion to support their families. When autumn and winter come, the problems arise. In winter, it is rare for anyone to go up the mountain, so the local gang all return to the fields and start the busy farming season in July. The Hubei gang has no land, so they have to do odd jobs or cut firewood on barren mountains. That life is even more difficult, so they would rather sweat profusely to earn the 970,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Lucky Members of the Presidential Residence The chair carriers in the Presidential Residence total eighteen people, one of whom is the leader. Every eight people carry a mountain chair, one for the President and one for the First Lady. Another person is a substitute. They are only busy for a while when the President goes up the mountain. However, the President rarely goes up the mountain more than twice a year, and each time he rarely stays for a month. Therefore, their work throughout the year may only be one or two months, and the rest of the time they have nothing to do. The busiest time was in the summer of 1946, when the KMT-CPC negotiations were in full swing. The President and his wife stayed on the mountain for a long time, and Marshall came and went nine times. Marshall had a special sedan chair prepared, also carried by eight people. These eight people were selected from the two thousand chair carriers in Lianhua Cave, and they also had a good summer.</p>
<p>Hope for This Year This year, the chair carriers have great hopes. There are quite a few vacationers in Kuling, especially foreigners. The chair carriers are preparing more sweat and more strength to serve the vacationers who want to enjoy themselves. Heroes' Slope has more than nine hundred steps. It takes at least twenty minutes to climb this section of the road. This group of chair carriers are all well-trained "heroes." They have not considered the ruggedness of the path, let alone the scorching sun or the torrential rain. They will continue to support the crown of "summer resort" with their shoulders and legs.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Lobotomy (4) New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Qingdao, 12th] On July 8th, Doctor Liu Mingduo gave a special report at the Qingdao Medical Association, talking about the method of performing frontal lobe lobotomy. He said: "Regarding the method of frontal lobe lobotomy: anesthesia can be Avertin or Ether mixed with oil for rectal anesthesia, or general anesthesia. Make a transverse incision 6cm from the upper edge of the cheekbone and the outer angle of the eyebrow on the supraorbital margin, or an arc-shaped incision. Separate the temporalis muscle, find the frontal-parietal suture of the skull, and open the skull with a skull trephine at that location. Cut the dura mater and cut the frontal lobe cortex vertically with a sharp blade. Then, put a blunt metal plate into the cut in the cortex and cut the white matter until the cerebral falx, Teritorium Cerebrum. Move the metal in a fan-shaped direction to complete the cutting. But be careful not to damage the temporal lobe and the posterior part of the frontal lobe. If the cut in the frontal lobe is too forward or too shallow, the surgical result will be poor or ineffective. If it is too far back, it will damage the motor center, the speech motor center, and the writing center. If it is too deep, it will injure the cerebral falx and cause unstoppable bleeding. Therefore, the position and depth of the incision are particularly important."</p>
<p>He held up a skull specimen and showed me the site of the burr hole and incision, and then drew a sketch. Two mental patients, He He and An Shuwen (a patient unable to speak), were operated on here. The location is approximately the upper-posterior area of the so-called two "temples." Wen Huisheng (epilepsy combined with left hemiplegia) had his skull opened on the right side of his head.</p>
<p>Each operation takes two hours. Opening the skull takes the longest time, and most of the surgical time is spent on this. After the incision is sutured, the skull will slowly grow back.</p>
<p>A patient with shaven hair, anesthetized, lies on the operating table, illuminated by bright shadowless lights. The head is wrapped in gauze, exposing only the surgical site. A group of doctors surrounds them, several pairs of hands tending to the opened hole, blood flowing. There are only footsteps, the clinking of metal instruments, and short, low whispers in the operating room. The scene is no different from other operations. The skull is opened, revealing the mysterious brain, which is active, the blood vessels pulsing faintly. This soft life is displayed in view. The key point of the operation begins at this time, and the incision is sutured immediately in a few minutes. Doctor Liu Mingduo's surgery is successful.</p>
<p>How many madmen in the world are urgently awaiting this effective cut! (End of the entire manuscript)</p>
<h3 id="e122">Reproduction Farm for Chiah Stone Sheep: The Corriedale Breed Develops in a Vigorous Climate <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Chen Jianxiong</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiaxing 14th Dispatch] The Jia region has always been known as a land of fish and rice, and in terms of its products, it is indeed an economic treasure. There is rice to eat, silk and wool to wear, rapeseed in Pinghu, tobacco leaves in Tongxiang, bricks and tiles in Jiashan... It can be said that there is nothing lacking in the daily necessities of life. Why is it that the farmers of the Jia region today still complain of hardship? This is entirely due to the farmers' ignorance of improvement and their adherence to old methods.</p>
<p>The former Tenth District Commissioner's Office, in order to exploit this treasure, cooperated with the Livestock Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and in October of last year, selected a site at the foot of Dongshan Mountain in Chiah Stone, Hai'ning, to establish a Jia District Sheep Breeding Farm, using the Australian "Corriedale" sheep breed to improve the local sheep breeds of the Jia District.</p>
<p>Currently, the farm has a total of 100 "Corriedale" sheep. "Corriedale" is a world-renowned breed with fine, long, and soft wool. The wool on its head alone can reach more than four inches in length and can be spun into 56-count yarn, which is about three times longer than the local breed on average. It is sheared once a year, yielding about nine catties. It is said that the local breed can only yield about two catties per year, so the quantity is also three times greater. According to the farm's estimate, if the Jia District has 300,000 local sheep, producing a total of 600,000 catties of wool, if all of them can be improved with the "Corriedale" breed, the wool production can reach 1.8 million catties. Furthermore, if the selling price per catty is 50% higher than that of the local breed, then the true contribution to the economy of the entire Jia District would be incomparable to things like "agricultural loans."</p>
<p>The method of improving local sheep breeds is to use a progressive system. A purebred "Corriedale" ram is used to mate with local sheep, and the resulting lambs are the first generation of improved breeds. The wool quality and quantity of this generation of improved breeds can only be increased by one time compared to the local sheep. Then, this generation of improved breeds is mated with purebred "Corriedale" sheep, and the resulting second generation will have wool quality and quantity that are one-third of that of the purebred. After three such matings, the improved breeds will have the same wool quality and quantity as the purebreds.</p>
<p>Currently, the farm has surveyed ten locations in Jiaxing's Wangdian, Haiyan's Shendang, Wuyuan, Hai'ning's Yuanhua, Jinshidun, Chang'an, Chongde's Zhi Bridge, Andeng Bridge, the urban area, and Tongxiang's urban area to establish mating stations, which are actively underway. Each mating station is equipped with two or more purebred "Corriedale" sheep. Each purebred sheep can naturally mate with a maximum of 300 sheep. Since the Jia District has a large number of local sheep, the farm is not limited by the number of matings. Director Xu of the farm has previously gone to Beijing to request artificial insemination equipment. Once the equipment arrives, the number of matings will be increased threefold. This economic development endeavor will undoubtedly provide considerable economic assistance to the farmers of the Jia District.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Yang Mei's Hunger Strike Mystery Fully Revealed; Only 21 Days of Hunger Endured; Confirmed to Have Secretly Eaten Multiple Times; Chongqing Health Bureau Stops Active Inspections; Fabricators of Mystification Are Truly Unforgivable <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing 17th Dispatch] (Late Dispatch) The Yang Mei Research Committee today issued a public statement saying: The Health Bureau appointed Doctor Gan Tianyou to preside over and secretly monitor Yang Mei, and discovered the following facts: At 9:00 AM on the 3rd, she ate congee, about one bowl. At 8:00 AM on the 4th, she ate about half a bowl of salted soybeans. At 12:00 PM on the 4th, she secretly entered someone else's bedroom, secretly opened a cabinet, and the amount of white sugar in a jar decreased. At 2:00 PM on the 5th, she put rice into her mouth. On the 10th, she ate burnt soybeans. At 3:25 PM on the 12th, she ate two pieces each of braised pork and potatoes. At 9:00 AM on the 14th, she ate a piece of grain husk. At 7:45 PM on the 15th, she ate congee, with one grain still remaining on her lower lip. On the 16th, an anal examination revealed coffee-colored matter, the odor of which was the same as feces. At 7:00 PM on the 17th, she secretly urinated once in the bathroom. It was also said that she had returned to Jiulongpo.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing 18th Dispatch] The Chongqing Health Bureau formally released a public statement on the 17th regarding Yang Mei's secret eating. The bureau stated that Yang Mei only had research value for being able to endure hunger for 21 days. The examination held by the bureau in May, lasting 21 days, confirmed that Yang Mei did not eat. During this examination period (from the 20th of last month to the present), Yang Mei secretly ate a small amount, which proved that Yang could endure hunger for up to 21 days, and it was deemed that there was no value in actively requesting an examination. Therefore, future work will be determined based on the request of Yang Mei or her guardian. If Yang or her guardian requests an examination, the Health Bureau will propose certain conditions for the examination to proceed. However, it is generally believed that after Yang Mei's secret is exposed, she will soon return to the rural area of Shigui. Furthermore, regarding the consequences of this incident, it is believed that Yang Mei is a rural woman and bears little responsibility, but her guardian knew that Yang Mei needed food to live, and yet deliberately fabricated such a mystification, which is truly unforgivable.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxing 17th Dispatch] Yang Dabao, a resident of Ximuwei, Fourth Bao, Yiwu Town, is a well-known local tyrant. This year, due to heavy flooding in the countryside, the fields were submerged. On July 13th, when the farmers of the wei were working together to rescue the situation, Yang Dabao suddenly arrived and forcibly claimed that a farmer named Jiang was not pumping water effectively and demanded a fine of two shi of rice as a warning. Jiang, a barber's assistant, could not afford it and politely asked for an exemption. However, Yang Dabao insisted that his words were like mountains and refused to retract them, which aroused public anger. Eighteen victims initiated a mutual contract, agreeing to share the consequences together. On the night of the 14th, they ambushed and killed Yang Dabao to eliminate the scourge. However, the matter was discovered by the local bao chief, who reported it to the Yiwu Town Office. Soldiers were dispatched to arrest the six murderers, including the monk Seng Pinlian, and they were all transferred to the county government for legal action.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi 17th Dispatch] At the Tonghui Bridge in the northern suburbs, Chen Huifang, a prostitute at the Tonghui Inn, claimed that she had been robbed in her room. She brought the tea servers Jin Qiugeng, Zhu Shengfu, Zhou Fucai, and Mao Zhenjia to the Eastern District Police Sub-Bureau. Because the prostitute had a relationship with Zhang Hong, the secretary of the sub-bureau, he colluded with officer Xing Renying to torture Jin Qiugeng and the others to extract confessions. They were hung with ropes and bamboo chopsticks were inserted into their fingers, causing Jin and the others to suffer serious injuries. The inn's labor union submitted a petition for a thorough investigation. Jin and the others also filed a lawsuit with the court for injury examination. After questioning, Prosecutor Shen ordered the detention of Zhang Hong. Xing Renying was released on bail with a guarantor and a written guarantee of 5 billion, pending legal action.</p>

<p>Bengbu [Our Newspaper Dispatch] The military authorities here recently cracked down on an illegal organization that was arbitrarily establishing titles, appointing officials, and recruiting soldiers. Xu Guangjie, a native of Lujiang, suddenly had a bizarre idea to form an army during the period of suppressing the rebellion, hoping to create a special force. On the morning of the 14th, the joint military, police, and gendarmerie supervision office searched No. 44 Jianguo Road and found a self-carved official seal. Xu, Zhang, and others have all been detained at the supervision office under strict guard and interrogated by the military court.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Mount Tai is in Anger; The Yellow River is Calling; The Qing Education Corps Holds its Induction Ceremony in Jinan <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Li Tian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 15th Airmail Dispatch] Facing the current situation, which is far more difficult than at any time in the past, the Shandong authorities, in order to passively provide education, relief, and training to a large number of out-of-school and unemployed youths, and to gather and preserve a strong force for the country, and actively cultivate a large number of basic-level military and political cadres for reconstruction to strengthen the combat system, have recruited and trained 8,000 young soldiers in Shandong, following the "100,000 Youths, 100,000 Soldiers" slogan called for by the head of state during the War of Resistance, and established the Youth Education Corps.</p>
<p>A Grand Gathering in White Horse Mountain</p>
<p>The Youth Education Corps is divided into three regiments, with a total quota of 8,000 people. Except for the Second Regiment, which has not yet started due to the repair of the camp address, the remaining First and Third Regiments, with approximately 5,000 people, officially held the induction ceremony on the 10th at the old site of the former Provincial Cadre Training Corps in White Horse Mountain on the outskirts of Jinan. On the day of the induction ceremony, almost all the leaders from all walks of life in the provincial capital attended. Undoubtedly, in terms of Shandong, this was an unprecedented grand gathering.</p>
<p>5,000 Young Soldiers Take an Oath</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, the induction ceremony began. The 5,000 young soldiers first read out their oath in the most high-pitched and majestic tone: "Faced with the country's many difficulties, we, based on conscience and sincerity, are willing to use the fire of enthusiasm and the iron of will, under the leadership of the supreme commander, to obey orders, abide by discipline, not fear difficulties, not fear death, create a new revolutionary force, implement the Three Principles of the People, and accomplish the great mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation." Then, Wang Yaowu, also the corps commander, encouraged them with four things: "Set great ambitions, be loving and sincere, don't fear hardship, and don't fear death."</p>
<p>Don't Miss the Time to Rise and Dance at the Rooster's Crow</p>
<p>The most unique aspect, which also won enthusiastic applause from the entire audience, was the poem composed on the spot by Pei Mingyu, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, to present to them: "Eight thousand disciples rise from Qingqi, Reorganizing rivers and mountains with extraordinary ambition, Vowing to sweep away the evil atmosphere and pacify the national crisis, Willing to rely on their own hands to save the people from disaster. The songs of Yan and Zhao are full of heroes, Generous heroes and heroines from their daughters, Suppressing the rebellion is now the time to test courage, Don't miss the time to rise and dance at the rooster's crow."</p>
<p>Then, Lu Ziren, Speaker of the Jinan Municipal Assembly, gave a speech, calling the young soldiers "people of lofty ideals" and urging them to maintain and promote the traditional spirit of the Whampoa Military Academy, remove the obstacles to the Three Principles of the People, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Finally, a representative of the young soldiers delivered a reply. After the ceremony, all the guests and young soldiers sat on the ground and shared a large pot of vegetables.</p>
<p>The Valiant Soldiers Sing the Corps Song at the Top of Their Lungs</p>
<p>The 5,000 valiant soldiers then marched into the city, parading for a week. The corps song was also deeply embedded in the hearts of the 700,000 citizens of Jinan. In particular, the following few sentences cannot be forgotten: "Look, war is raging, and the victims are everywhere. Parents, wives, and children are displaced and scattered. It is a catastrophe for humanity, it is the riot of traitors and bandits, making the world lose its paradise of happiness." "Mount Tai is in anger, the Yellow River is calling, urging us youths to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the times. We are youths, we are heroes. We ignite the fire of anger in our hearts, hold high the torches, and drive away the evil atmosphere. Strive forward!"</p>

<h3 id="e134">General Prices: Strong Expectations of Rising Prices; The Future is Truly Alarming <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The general prices last week, at the beginning of the week, opened flat. Due to the excessive rise at the end of the previous week and the announcement by the authorities that they would sell large quantities of goods to tighten credit, people were cautious and sellers offered to sell. For example, cotton yarn fell back by about 10%. In the middle of the week, due to tight credit, high black market interest rates, and mixed ups and downs, the trend was relatively stable. From Friday onwards, due to the authorities' announcement of the cost of living index for the first half of July, which was 1.38 million times for workers and 1.07 million times for police officers, coupled with rumors of issuing large denominations of currency, prices rose again. The overall wholesale price index for the past week was 3,637,135 times, up 34.18% from the previous week, breaking through the 3 million times mark. Looking ahead, it is truly alarming. The credit situation last week, judging from the exchange situation of the Central Bank, was not too tight, but black market interest rates once reached over 70%, which shows the weakness of everyone's confidence in legal tender and the strong expectations of rising prices.</p>
<p>Due to the depletion of cash chips, the Central Bank previously stipulated that each bank could receive cash amounts of 4 billion yuan, 10 billion yuan, and 20 billion yuan per day. Last week, due to the announcement of the mid-month index and the arrival of the payroll period, the need for cash was particularly urgent. However, the authorities repeatedly denied the issuance of large denominations of currency for fear of stimulating price increases, which caused great inconvenience to the market. In recent days, there has been an abnormally high phenomenon of remittance rates in various places, which is undoubtedly related to the lack of cash chips. As a result of inflation, the amount of chips naturally increases dramatically. The authorities cannot come up with more countermeasures from the root cause, and this method of picking up the scraps and chasing after the end is indeed in need of correction.</p>
<p>Regarding the national general budget case for the second half of this year, President Weng submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for discussion on the 2nd of this month. According to the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan: "The main points of the general budget: (1) Ordinary budgets can be offset by tax revenues and may have a surplus. (2) Special budgets can be offset by selling various materials and other methods, and no more currency issuance may be added in the second half of the year."</p>
<p>It is also learned that: The national general budget for the second half of the 37th year includes ordinary budget expenditures of over 320 trillion yuan and special budget expenditures of over 590 trillion yuan. The general budget also states that ordinary expenditures are offset by tax revenues and have a surplus; special budgets are offset by selling state-owned assets, materials, compulsory borrowing, and debt income, and no more banknotes may be issued. The case was first reviewed in groups by the Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan and then comprehensively reviewed on the 14th. According to the Legislative Yuan's news team, the income part was generally increased and the expenditure part was reduced.</p>
<p>The first major thing that the constitutional government should be responsible for to the people is the budget issue. However, this time the Legislative Yuan's review of the budget was always conducted in a "secret" meeting, which seems no different from the style before the constitution. The people, as the masters of the house, do not know the details. We not only feel regret, but we should also awaken the people to pay more attention, form a trend, and urge the government to publicize the budget, because an unbalanced budget is the source of all current economic ills and cannot be ignored in the slightest.</p>
<p>In addition, in the midst of the budget review, we feel that the government still has many areas in which it should do but has not done in terms of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. For example, the recently established Suppression of Rebellion and National Construction Committee is said to have as many as 900 to thousands of members, all with senior-level treatment. For such measures, the state's expenditure of huge amounts of public funds is truly in need of discussion. We would like to awaken the authorities that today's price index is more than 3 million times higher, and countless people are sacrificing under high prices. The government must not waste any of it.</p>
<p>The general price trend in the commodity market last week was that, due to the high level at the end of the previous week and tighter credit, it hovered in a tired state at the beginning and in the middle of the week. Since Friday, the Central Bank's exchange difference has been as high as 1.3 trillion, credit has loosened, the news is positive, and buying sentiment is strong. All goods have rebounded in unison, close to the original level at the end of the previous week, but few new prices have appeared.</p>
<p>The wholesale price index classified by use last week is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e135">Currency and Finance: Tight Monetary Conditions Once Prevailed, with Widespread High Interest Rates in the Black Market <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Last week, although the city's monetary conditions were extremely tight for a period, it lasted only two or three days before easing again. The reason for the temporary tightening was indeed the impact of the authorities selling off goods and the substantial deficit of national banks and bureaus. However, it is reported that the suppression of remittances from various locations on Tuesday also contributed. Nevertheless, this method of building dams and cutting off the flow cannot be sustained, so by Friday, the easing of monetary conditions had become a widespread trend.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon last week was the continued shortage of cash. This was naturally stimulated by the sharp rise in prices, which made the amount of cash available seem insufficient. However, with the high internal exchange rates, it became profitable to transport cash because of the significant losses incurred when remitting funds to other ports. This was also one of the main reasons for the shortage of cash in the city. The scarcity of cash led to the emergence of discounts on the market. Consequently, the increased issuance of promissory notes and traveler's checks further exacerbated the degree and severity of inflation.</p>
<p>Last week, the prevailing black market interest rate was 5.4%, with the lowest being above 4%. In some cases, it even reached 6%. As for the daily interbank lending rate on the market, which amounted to 25 yuan, if calculated as a monthly rate, it was already above 7%, which was unprecedented.</p>
<p>From Monday to Friday, the national banks and bureaus had a total deficit of 138.67 billion. However, this included the transfer of 100 billion from the Central Bank to the Bank of Taiwan on Thursday. Therefore, the actual deficit of the banks and bureaus in five days was only slightly over 380 billion. This also shows that the so-called sale of goods could hardly match the enormous expenditures of the national treasury.</p>
<p>However, the surplus of foreign banks during the week was quite remarkable. From Monday to Friday, the total surplus was 528.89 billion, setting a new record. From this, it is not difficult to see that the flight of capital is still intensifying.</p>
<p>Commercial banks and firms generally experienced uneven positions. Before Thursday, there was a general shortage, so interbank lending was quite active. On Friday, however, positions eased, and lending decreased sharply. After the clearing of accounts by firms after number 60, from Monday to Friday, the total deficit was 643.45 billion. Even after deducting the 100 million in funds transferred by the Bank of Taiwan to the Central Bank, the indirect deficit still reached over 500 billion. Such a high amount was also rare in the past.</p>
<p>Internal and External Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the city's internal exchange rates generally remained high. The exchange rate for Guangzhou was 450 yuan from Monday to Thursday, slightly dropping to 400 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Xiamen rose repeatedly throughout the week, from 450 yuan on Monday to 500 yuan on Tuesday, and further to 550 yuan on Friday. This fully indicates the trend of capital flowing south. Even if the funds remitted from the city to South China were discounted by half, it was still considered worthwhile.</p>
<p>The exchange rate for Chongqing was 200 yuan before Thursday, slightly decreasing to 160 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Hankou rose from 400 yuan on Monday to 450 yuan on Tuesday, then dropped to 300 yuan on Friday. Another significance of the high exchange rates is that the prices in the city are higher than in other ports, which may lead to the reverse flow of goods into the metropolis. Last week, the exchange rate for Tianjin was at par before Thursday, but returned to a discount of 50 yuan on Friday.</p>
<p>The price of foreign exchange certificates fluctuated significantly last week. It was 3 million on Monday, rising by 250,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then falling back to Monday's level on Thursday and Friday. The exchange rate for Hong Kong remittances had shrunk to a ratio of 100,000 legal tender to one Hong Kong dollar from Monday to Thursday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was approximately 5.45 yuan, while the price of gold per tael rose from 324.75 yuan to 329.50 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of this week, monetary conditions were still loose. The Chinese stock market was actively sought after, with investors eagerly participating. As a result, as many as 19 stocks rose to the daily limit. Wing On Textile hit a new high of 9,475 yuan, up 860 yuan from the previous week. On Tuesday, due to the authorities' massive sale of goods and the overall tightening of monetary conditions, the deficit of national banks and bureaus reached a huge sum of over 32 billion. The stock market then showed a volatile trend. While Wing On Textile initially reached a new high of 10,350 yuan, and Mei Ya once hit the daily limit of 5,950 yuan, they soon weakened and plummeted. Wing On Textile closed at 9,200 yuan, showing significant fluctuations in one day. Most other smaller stocks fell to the limit. On Wednesday, the strong monetary conditions persisted, and cash was particularly scarce. The stock market experienced a phenomenon of inability to settle transactions, with a general slow decline. As many as nine stocks fell to the limit. Wing On Textile fell to a low of 8,500 yuan, then slightly recovered to close at 9,280 yuan. On Thursday, monetary conditions became even tighter, and many stocks fell to the limit. Wing On Textile, relying on the support of the Cantonese community, barely managed to hold on outside the 90 million mark. On Friday, due to a large influx of speculative funds from other ports, monetary conditions eased again. The stock market, which had been sluggish for several days, showed a comprehensive recovery. Retail buying was active. Wing On Textile, Mei Ya, and Xin He all rose to the limit at the opening. Other stocks also followed suit, with as many as 21 stocks rising to the limit, an increase of 10% to 20% compared to the previous day. Wing On Textile only traded at one price of 10,055 yuan throughout the day.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks did not trade this week.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Industrial and Commercial Dynamics: Uncoordinated Economic Measures <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The authorities' various economic and financial measures often demonstrate extremely uncoordinated steps. While the authorities may remain indifferent to this inconsistency, at most bearing the reputation of being untrustworthy, it represents a significant loss for the industrial and commercial sectors and the general public. Several facts from the past week are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of price increases for public utilities, on the 3rd of this month, Governor Yu of the Central Bank announced to the press that the issue of stabilizing the prices of public utilities in Shanghai had been discussed and decided upon, and would be implemented immediately, stating that this was an important step in stabilizing prices. However, on the same day, Mayor Wu had already approved the new prices for water, electricity, and gas for July, with the new prices increasing by an average of 175% compared to the previous month. Public transportation services had also increased their prices by more than 50%.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the cost of living index and layoffs, although the cost of living index for June announced by the authorities was only half of the average price index for that month, it had already increased by more than 100% compared to the cost of living index for May. This measure can be said to have met the minimum requirements of public sentiment, and the fact that labor-management relations in the city did not completely break down can also be attributed to the continued increase in this index. However, unexpectedly, the authorities themselves plunged into the vortex of labor disputes. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Shanghai Public Transportation Company of the Public Utilities Bureau announced the dismissal of 75 drivers from the 21st class and 127 ticket sellers from the 18th class, causing a major uproar in the transportation sector. All internal and external staff of the company unanimously expressed their sympathy and support, resulting in the non-operation of more than 300 buses on all lines on the 8th, paralyzing half of the city's transportation.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of preventing the influx of speculative funds from the north into the city, reports indicate that the Shanghai authorities have decided on five measures, the first of which is to control the contraction of currency and credit, which includes four suggestions: first, to suggest that the central government restrict deposits and withdrawals and prohibit commercial banks and firms from handling Shanghai remittances; second, to limit the amount of cash that ordinary people can bring into Shanghai to no more than 200 million yuan. However, in reality, Shanghai remittances from the Northeast and North China have already been opened, and Governor Yu of the Central Bank has also stated that the purpose of opening Shanghai remittances is to allow legitimate industrial and commercial funds to be remitted. Regardless of which theory held before and after is correct or incorrect, it at least indicates that the authorities' decisions are hesitant and inconsistent.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the allocation of US aid materials and the issue of import handling, the import industry had placed great hope on it. However, it is said that the allocation of US aid materials, such as cotton, tobacco, diesel, gasoline, and other equipment and raw materials, is limited to a few industrial and commercial enterprises and American import merchants, causing great dissatisfaction among the import and export industries, who have protested.</p>
<p>As for the issue of importing US aid materials, as of last month, it is said that only petroleum is handled by petroleum companies. Shen Xirui of the US Aid Utilization Council also stated that because there are many technical issues in transporting US aid materials from the United States or US territories to China, it must be handled by American import merchants. However, Chinese import merchants hope to handle it themselves. If this cannot be achieved, the sacrifice of the rights and interests of domestic industry and commerce will be considerable!</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the issue of whether the import quota for the seventh quarter will be reduced, the city's import industry and industrial and commercial sectors are extremely concerned. In theory, the US aid bilateral agreement has already been signed, and the export foreign exchange settlement figures for June have exceeded US$20 million, setting a record for export foreign exchange settlement this year. Therefore, the import quota should be relaxed, which can indirectly promote the increase in exports. However, it is now reported that the quota for the seventh quarter will not only not increase but will also decrease, which may be a blow to the newly implemented foreign exchange settlement method.</p>
<p>(6) In order to make up for the financial deficit, the authorities are also making every effort to sell state-owned enterprises. It is reported that the government has ordered the Central Bank to organize a syndicate to preside over this matter. It is also estimated that the sale of state-owned industries is worth more than US$500 million. If it can be implemented smoothly, this is certainly a considerable income. However, if the temporary property tax proposed by the Legislative Yuan is implemented, no one will buy state-owned enterprises, and the industrial sector will certainly not want to bear high taxes for purchasing industries. It can be seen that the two measures are also contradictory. In short, the more chaotic the situation, the more uncoordinated the various measures taken by the authorities will be!</p>
<h3 id="e137">Market Conditions in Various Regions <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>

<h3 id="e138">Government Continues Negotiations to Stop Capital Flight to Hong Kong <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Issuing Currency by Local Governments is Not Permitted by Law</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 18th] The Ministry of Finance has been paying close attention to the issue of capital outflow. Previously, in order to prevent capital flight, it successively established limits on the amount of national currency that could be taken out of the country, with a limit of 5 million yuan per person, and foreign currency limited to 100 US dollars or the equivalent in other foreign currencies. It also prohibited banks and firms in various domestic locations from handling remittances of national currency to Hong Kong and Macau, restricted travelers from carrying foreign currency and securities out of the country, and strictly prohibited black market trading of Hong Kong dollars. Subsequently, in order to thoroughly crack down on capital flight to Hong Kong, it also negotiated a Sino-Hong Kong financial agreement with the Hong Kong government, in order to cooperate in cracking down on the black market for foreign exchange and smuggling in South China. The agreement has already been partially implemented. Currently, in order to further effectively stop capital flight to Hong Kong, negotiations are continuing. As for the figures for capital flight, because it is carried out secretly, it is impossible to accurately calculate. The Ministry of Finance has not heard of the rumor that the Guangdong provincial authorities plan to issue banknotes independently within the province. Without the approval of the Ministry of Finance, provincial-level local governments adopting special monetary systems is not permitted by law.</p>

<p>Brief History</p>
<p>Shanghai University was founded six years before the founding of the Republic of China (1906 AD). Originally named Shanghai Baptist Theological Seminary and Baptist University, it was established by American missionaries from the Northern and Southern Baptist Conventions, who raised 120,000 yuan to purchase 165 acres of land on the banks of the Huangpu River to build the school. It was renamed Shanghai University in 1915. In 1927, the board of directors was formally reorganized in accordance with the regulations for private school boards published by the government. In January 1928, Dr. Liu Zhanen was elected as the first Chinese president to carry out the registration procedures. In March 1929, the Ministry of Education approved the registration. In 1931, the College of Commerce in the city center was subsequently established. In 1937, the Battle of Shanghai broke out, and the Yangshupu campus was located in the war zone, so the school hastily moved to the city center and continued classes at the College of Commerce. On April 7, 1938, President Liu Zhanen was assassinated in Shanghai by enemy and puppet forces for his loyal service to the country, becoming the first person in the educational field to sacrifice for the country since the War of Resistance. Afterwards, the school continued to promote school affairs in an extremely difficult and harsh environment, and formed the East China Christian University Association with St. John's University, Soochow University, and other schools, offering joint courses and libraries, and holding joint graduation ceremonies, demonstrating the unique spirit of Christianity with harmony and mutual assistance. In the winter of 1941, the Pacific War broke out, and the enemy and puppet forces occupied the entire city of Shanghai. Due to the unchanged environment, the school had no choice but to announce its closure. In order to maintain the school's long-standing excellent faculty and students' studies, the alumni association took over and changed it to Shanghai College. At the same time, the American founders and alumni association in Chongqing planned to move the school westward and re-establish it in Chongqing. In February of the following year, they finally succeeded. Initially, it was combined with Soochow University to form the Soochow Shanghai University College of Law and Commerce, and later, Zhejiang University joined, forming the College of Law, Commerce, and Engineering. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, Shanghai University immediately resumed its operations in Shanghai, and in mid-April 1946, it moved back to the Yangshupu campus to hold classes.</p>
<p>Present Situation</p>
<p>The current president of the school is Ling Xianyang.

<p>Brief History</p>
<p>Aurora University was founded in the 29th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the former Qing Dynasty. It was established by the Catholic Church and has been around for 45 years. It was originally named Aurora College, with preparatory and undergraduate departments of arts and sciences. The school was located at the old Xujiahui Observatory. In the 34th year of Guangxu, it moved to the current site on Lupan Road. In the 3rd year of Xuantong, departments of medicine and law and political science were added. In the 6th year of the Republic of China, it was renamed Aurora University. In the 19th year, the current name was finalized. In the 20th year, it was approved by the Ministry of Education of the Nanjing National Government. The current president, Hu Wanyao, took office in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The chairman of the board, Xie Guansheng, took office in the 35th year and were both early students of the school. It is said that Weng Wenhao, Yu Bin, and Hong Lanyou were also early graduates of the school.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Olympic Torch Advances Under Tight Security by Greek Army: Ambushed by Greek Guerrillas in Katakolon Port <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>[Athens, July 17, report from the agency] The Olympic torch was carried by runners today, starting from Olympia village in Greece, to begin the first leg of the 2,000-mile journey. Because several foreign journalists and officers of a Greek destroyer were attacked by guerrillas in Katakolon Port on the way to Olympia village to watch the lighting of the torch today, the route of the torch is under tight security by the Greek army. A guerrilla broadcast announced that General Markos had ordered guerrillas to stop the Olympic torch from reaching London. The attack on British and American journalists is probably related to this. Before the start, the first runner was fully armed. After the torch was lit, the runner took off his military uniform, put down his weapons, and dressed in shorts, began to set off as an athlete, holding the torch high. The torch was carried to Katakolon Port, 50 miles from Olympia village, and then transported by a Greek destroyer to Crete, where it was handed over to another runner to be transported to the British destroyer to Bari Port in southern Italy, and then carried forward by Italian runners. It is scheduled to arrive at Wembley Stadium on the afternoon of July 29.</p>
<p>[Reuters Athens, July 17] According to a report from Patras: Foreign journalists and an officer of a Greek destroyer were attacked by Greek guerrillas today while watching the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Olympia. The guerrillas were later repelled by the Greek army. It is reported that one Greek soldier was killed.</p>

<p>Jinlan defeated Lianmei 9-6 yesterday, maintaining an undefeated record in the Group A tennis league. Except for the match postponed due to rain last Thursday, the second round of the competition will begin this Thursday. The current situation is as follows:</p>
<p>In addition to the Jinlan-Lianmei match yesterday, Tiyun defeated the home team Enpai 10-5, and Green Light defeated Youlian 13-2 on the home field.</p>
<p>Both Jinlan and Lianmei had strong lineups, and the competition was very intense. In particular, the defeat of Yu Wenzheng and Cai Guoji's team by Ye Guanhong and Li Guofan's team was the most eye-catching and was appreciated by the audience. Lianmei's strength was greatly affected due to Lin Baohua, Xu Peizhi, and Zhu's absence, especially the failure of the third group, which suffered the most.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth pairs started the trial first. Unexpectedly, Lianmei could get all six points, but in the third set of the last four groups, Yu Tianguang's "match point" was lost, and the set was lost instead, reducing one point. The same situation occurred in the fifth pair. Lianmei won each with a score of 2-1, and Lianmei scored 4 points and Jinlan scored 2 points. The second pair was a combination of Li Wencheng and Liu Delin, and Tao Guanqiu and Zhou Guanjun scored three points, and the score became 5-4, with Jinlan scoring one more point. The third pair took the stage, and Chen Yi fought hard, but Wu Jingxue was weak and was made an attack point. Jinlan Cai and Wei scored three consecutive sets, and the score became 8-4.</p>
<p>The first pair, Ye and Li, had nothing to offer. Wang and Cai won the second and third sets easily with a score of 6-2. Ye and Li's high kill blocks were quite successful, winning with scores of 6-3 and 6-4, and the total score became 9-6. Cai Guoji's doubles performance was the best, but he made a "foot fault" when serving, and Yu Tianguang's jump should be paid special attention to. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>[Jinlan defeats Lianmei]</p>
<p>(1) Wang Wenzheng Cai Guoji</p>
<p>6-2 3-6 4-6</p>
<p>Ye Guanhong Ji Guofan</p>
<p>(2) Tao Guanqiu Zhou Guanjun</p>
<p>6-0 6-0 6-4</p>
<p>Li Wencheng Liu De</p>
<p>(3) Shi Sun Tang Baojia</p>
<p>6-5 6-3 6-2</p>
<p>Chen Yi Wu Jingxue</p>
<p>(4) Li Leiyou Luo Xiaozhang</p>

<h3 id="e158">73 Teams Participate in the Competition: The Third Table Tennis League Opens Tonight: 14 Matches in Groups A, B, and C <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The third Shanghai Table Tennis League, organized by the Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, will be contested by 73 teams, divided into Groups A, B, and C. The first week's order has been arranged and will start at 6:30 pm today (19th) in the nine ballrooms of the Jingwu Main Branch Post Office, etc. All venues will not sell tickets. People from all walks of life are welcome to visit nearby to promote the sport.</p>
<p>There are a total of 14 matches today, including 2 matches in Group A, 4 matches in Group B, and 8 matches in Group C. The players of each team must participate in the competition according to the list of team members in the handbook. If there is any impersonation or unauthorized substitution of players, the qualifications will be immediately revoked upon discovery. The organizers hope that after the competition, the winning team will send the record sheet to Chen Linsheng, Hualian Tongle Club, No. 194 Nanjing East Road, for sorting out in order to publicize the results. The order of the two Group A matches tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Huamei - Qinglian (Group A) 8 pm Jingfen</p>
<p>Jingwu Huang - Nanhua (Group A) 8 pm Jingzong</p>
<p>Huamei has emerged as a dark horse with strong strength. Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, and Li Zongpei, the three swordsmen of the Shanghai Star team, are all key players in the team. Although Qinglian has emerging stars such as Liu Baotai, Ma Gengyao, and Xiao Maojin, they are obviously no match for Huamei. However, these young players will uphold the spirit of perseverance and resist strong teachers in order to gain combat experience, and will not be disgraced even if they lose.</p>
<p>Nanhua is the incarnation of Hualian. Lu Wenliang, Zheng Jiakun, and Zhong Zhihui are all good players from the Hualian team. There is also Cai Xiuyu, the Shanghai women's champion who attended the National Games, participating in the battle. Jingwu Huang is not weak either. Players such as veterans Li Longbiao, Li Peiran, and Liang are all veterans who have fought on the battlefield for a long time. The strength of the two teams is difficult to distinguish, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The following is a record of the order of each match in Groups B and C tonight</p>
<p>Qingnian - Zhongxin (Group B) 6:30 pm Youwu</p>
<p>Zhongyou - Xinsheng (Group B) 8 pm Youwu</p>
<p>Hucai - Taiping (Group B) 6:30 pm Hucai</p>
<p>Chunmao - Huayin (Group B) 6:30 pm Chunmao</p>
<p>Lvying Lv Xinxing C (Group C1) 6:30 pm Lvying</p>

<h3 id="e163">The Story of a Car Salesman <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Lv Man</p>
<p>Casually flipping through a newly arrived American magazine, you can easily find many colorfully printed advertisements, and the most exquisitely designed and widest-ranging are often car advertisements. Ford Motor Company's advertisement often features a Westerner's crystal ball for fortune-telling, and next to the crystal ball is a slogan that says, "You will always buy a Ford car in the future." Really, who doesn't want to buy a beautiful car for transportation?</p>
<p>However, forty years ago, the average American still often held a skeptical attitude towards cars. At that time, the roads were far from as wide and flat as they are today, and the cars themselves were not yet manufactured to perfection, so it was common to "break down" in the middle of the road, and it was quite troublesome to repair. Selling cars was really a thankless job.</p>
<p>Therefore, car salesmen used their brains and kept racking their brains to think about sales "gimmicks."</p>
<p>One day, a short advertisement suddenly appeared in a Los Angeles newspaper, saying that "the weather is extremely cold, and half of the oranges in my garden have been frozen and damaged, resulting in huge losses, so I have to reluctantly sell cars at a low price." Enthusiastic and curious people went to the unfortunate person's home to see the cheap car. It just so happened that the car owner had excellent eloquence and described the benefits of the car in glowing terms. As a result, he quickly found a buyer. But did the latecomers leave empty-handed? Not at all. It turned out that when the second buyer who wanted cheap goods came, there was another old car waiting there. As a result, the family sold many old cars and made a lot of money. The car owner was only about twenty years old and had already established himself as a self-made man. He was not lying. There were indeed orange trees in his backyard, but there were only two in total. In this cold snap, one of them was indeed frozen and damaged.</p>
<p>Slowly, the young car broker officially became the branch manager of a local car company, and he enthusiastically promoted various new cars. However, most of the local residents still felt that the price was too high, and although they loved them, they were reluctant to take out large stacks of banknotes to buy them. The manager had a flash of inspiration and came up with another trick. He said that he sold cars, but customers did not necessarily have to pay money: customers could exchange things with him. After this method was announced, business immediately flourished, and residents flocked to exchange their diamonds, horses, carriages, real estate, orchards, etc. for new cars. But when the manager sold those diamonds, horses, real estate, etc., the money he got was much higher than the car's price. A small trick not only sold countless cars, but also made a lot of money for himself.</p>
<p>However, even though his powers were vast, he inevitably failed occasionally. One day, a veterinarian came to his store and took a fancy to an old Jackson-brand car. He wanted to test drive the car, but the genius salesman was secretly anxious. It turned out that this "antique car" produced in 1905 was really not able to withstand much "testing"; but for the sake of business, he had no choice but to agree happily and personally drove the car to send the veterinarian home. Unexpectedly, he was blessed by good fortune, and the car arrived safely without breaking down. The veterinarian was overjoyed and sat in his kitchen to prepare to sign the car purchase contract, but he suddenly stopped writing, turned around, and asked a question that was difficult to answer.</p>
<p>He said, "Your car is not bad. But let me ask you a question: If the person buying the car is not me but yourself, do you think this car is worth buying?"</p>
<p>The salesman's heart skipped a beat. He was still young, and he desperately wanted this deal to succeed so that he could earn a commission that he urgently needed. Just as he was hesitating, he looked up and saw a banner with words embroidered on it hanging on the wall. The banner clearly read:</p>
<p>"God is listening to your every word."</p>
<p>As a result: He drove the broken car back—the deal was not successful.</p>
<p>You may want to know the current status of this car salesman, right? Indeed, it is impossible for such a person to end up unknown.</p>
<p>He is Hoffman, the big boss of Studebaker Corporation in the United States. President Truman knew of his abilities, so on April 5 of this year, he entrusted him with a job that concerned the safety of the whole world. Since that day, Hoffman, the chief executive of the European Recovery Program, has become one of the most popular and busiest people in Washington's political circles.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Recent Poetic Talks <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Damu</p>
<p>In recent times, Yang Yunshi once served as a private secretary to Wu Peifu, naming his residence "Jiangshan Wanli Lou" (Ten Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains Pavilion). His poetry followed the style of Old Du (Du Fu), possessing a certain meaning beyond the words. I once saw his three poems on crickets, and now I record one of them: "Also knowing my late birth, the seasons have already gathered the cicadas, the lamp reflects in the pool pavilion like water, the passes and mountains are filled with clouds. The sound counts as the stars about to dawn, a lonely guest makes the night a year, why is the anxious heart so troubled, who is wiser than you in enduring the levies?"</p>
<p>Longyang talent Yi Shifu was as famous as Fan Fanshan, author of the "Four Souls Poetry Collection," namely Soul East, Soul West, Soul South, and Soul North. Yi was seen as a child prodigy since young, said to be able to compose poetry at seven years old, but his poetic realm is desolate, could it be that poverty leads to skillful writing! Such as the poem "Remaining Summer": "The lingering summer is distressing, rain easily brings autumn, the chirping of crickets is like lingering anger, the cold cicadas rest, the water covered in smoke as the water chestnuts withered, the lonely tree stands tall, and the moon is bright above the pavilion, towards the evening the west wind is urgent, pacing back and forth and singing the four sorrows."</p>
<p>Wang Lixi was from Jiangxi, a famous writer of his time, who once served as the editor-in-chief of "Reading Magazine" at the Shenzhou Guoguang Society, which was very popular for a time. In the early years of the War of Resistance, he unfortunately died on the way representing the National Literary Association to comfort the front-line soldiers. Wang could write poetry, and I saw a poem he casually composed in early autumn: "The years urge me to age, autumn wind is upon me again, I have failed the country in vain, learning to rely on others in poverty! The mountain willows droop and frown, the forest insects enter the ear anew, alas, my seven-foot frame, is but suffering in the wind and dust."</p>
<p>Dr. Liu Bannong excelled at composing limericks, calling himself the master of "Ringtonghua Zhidou Tang" (Ringtonghua Sesame Soybean Hall), which meant that his ringtong flowers, peanuts, sesame, and soybeans could all be used to make oil. Therefore, his works were mostly simple and easy to understand. There is a self-lamenting poem that says: "Sitting and possessing a city of books, I boast, but is the inkstone field and pen array a livelihood, Heaven gave me this Chinese body but it is useless, just like a grain of sand in the Ganges."</p>
<p>Shen Yinmo was skilled in writing quatrains, and his works were clear, elegant, and gentle, quite like Wen Tingyun of the Tang Dynasty, such as "Casual Spring Day": "Green water flows, a boat reflecting the evening glow, the cold plums have fallen and spring is blooming again, the young woman in her boudoir looks from the tower, fearing to see the wind teasing the slanting willows."</p>
<p>Hu Huaichen, originally named Ji　, was a prominent figure in the "Saturday School" back then. Later, seeing his kinsman Hu Shi advocating the New Literature, he also rose up to imitate it, with "Dajiang Ji New Poems" echoing Hu Shi's "A Book of Experiments". He also founded the "Novel Revolutionary Army", but its impact was minimal. In his later years, he taught at Daxia, Chizhi, and other universities, dying in poverty and distress. He worked very diligently on literary history throughout his life, often forgetting to eat and sleep, and once created the theory that Mo Di was an Indian, which caused a public outcry for a time. After his death, many volumes of "Jichen Miscellaneous Poems" remained unprinted. I obtained a poem "Spring Rain": "The mist is hazy and the weather is not clear, the east wind blows the sound of cuckoos, a day of floral rain at the late firewood gate, the three months of fish growing in the spring water, the purple swallows carrying mud dislike the slipperiness, the white clouds coming out of the mountain are also clear, the peach blossoms are originally from the celestial land, falling into the human world with lightness of gain and loss."</p>
<p>Ms. Lu Yin graduated from Beijing Women's Higher Normal School, and her old poems had a solid foundation. She wrote many works in her life, but unfortunately, she scattered and discarded them at will. I have a poem lamenting chrysanthemums, signed Huang Ying. The poem says: "The lingering fragrant soul is seen in dreams, several times my heart breaks at the time of the dawn frost, the yellow withering makes the sadness quick, the chastity that was gathered in those days is regretted, wine cannot pour away sorrow, only crying, the flower cannot laugh in purple, sadly unknowing, originally the forms and appearances have all become illusions, busying the poets to write elegiac poems."</p>
<p>Lin Huiyin was the daughter of Changmin, and married Liang Rengong's son Sicheng as his wife, she was indeed a contemporary female poet. I once saw Lin's quatrain that says: "Hibiscus flowers bloom, a heart-breaking red, secrets, subtle waves gently communicating, wanting to let a small boat go and gather on the river, how many times the sad rain and sad wind." A subtle and beautiful, recitable work.</p>

<p>"Summer days are long, good for sleeping." But why do people need to sleep?</p>
<p>Many people have answered this question, but so far, there is much disagreement and no conclusion.</p>
<p>The most wonderful is the late Professor Munila of the French National Academy of Sciences, who said that there is a mysterious gas in the air, called "sleep gas," which makes you want to sleep when you breathe it. He said that "sleep gas" is most abundant in the country air, so it may be produced by plants. He has repeatedly tried to put "sleep gas" in bottles, but unfortunately, he did not succeed.</p>

<p>Almost every day, I have to pass through the crossroads several times, especially in the central area around Jiangxi Road. From about 10 am to 5 pm, that area becomes even more crowded, with pedestrians and vehicles coming and going, a chaotic scene. Each person's eyes have their own direction of walking. Although there are traffic lights to control, pedestrians still take the opportunity to pass through the narrow gaps between vehicles. At that time, their situation of rushing to all sides was not in the form of a "cross", it was simply in the form of an "asterisk"!</p>
<p>Writers like to use "crossroads" to symbolize the hesitation and divergence of the parties involved, but from my perspective as an observer at the crossroads in the central district, the pedestrians and wheels do not hesitate at all when they come and go; on the contrary, they are all very determined, and they are determined to go in the direction they want, even close to stubbornness. A tricycle driving obliquely almost knocked down a teenager riding a bicycle. The teenager hurriedly jumped down, and scolded angrily, but the tricycle was already far away. It seems that those who are hesitating at the "crossroads" are only those daydreamers who only speak lofty words. The practical people do not take it as a matter at all.</p>

<p>President Truman now has the following means of transportation dedicated to his personal use: (1) the plane "Sacred Semi"; (2) the yacht "Williamsburg"; (3) several specially made cars; (4) a specially made bulletproof train carriage. The train carriage is especially well-made and will not be damaged even if a bomb is thrown at it.</p>
<p>The Nazi books seized by the American military stationed in Germany were not destroyed. The reason is that they have reprocessed the paper of these books into pulp and used it to make new paper for printing textbooks.</p>
<p>Hitler's private yacht was obtained by a British nightclub at auction for $300,000.</p>
<p>The seats on the plane used by King George VI of England all face away from the direction the plane is traveling. It is said that this is safer in case of a forced landing.</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Listening to the clear sounds of cicadas during illness, I roughly understand their meaning and translate it into insect language as follows:</p>
<p>Thirsty, drinking the cool wind, hungry, eating the clear dew, relying on height to look far, the heart is full of worry and fear. No noble, no humble, together facing the 　tomb, 　　my voice, what the common people utter, Heaven listens from below, reflect on yourself, do not be angry!</p>
<p>Not things are the disaster, but human plans are really short, the official shows an example, calculating every penny, climbing step by step, who can control Heaven's will? Blame those merchants, going far from governance day by day, a quick knife to cut silk, courageous in one cut!</p>
<p>Careful planning is essential, clarity is not scrutiny, promote the good and reject the bad, as water flows to the level, the crime deserves death, the reward does not exceed the merit, Wei Yang moved the wood, the order must be carried out, the official is evil, the government fails, expand and purify.</p>
<p>Wildfires knot spring weeds, chaos like grass, why not train the young and strong, the homeland is self-protected, 　its command, relax the levy, living defends the home, plowing does not waste rice, geographical advantage and human harmony, why worry about old teachers?</p>
<p>To fight without teaching, is surely a waste of manpower, forcing them to go to war, also destroys families, if the laws are truly good, the abuses will come out in clusters, then let the traitors, be able to release slippery tongues, driving fish into the abyss, it is unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>A salary to foster honesty, what is it like today? To heal hunger and save from cold, is called greed and harshness, taking from the people, the people's resentment increases more and more, isolated government offices everywhere, reflected in the dangerous waves, changes arise in the elbow and armpit, what if the dike collapses?</p>
<p>The river and sea are the measure, the instrument cannot be narrow, talents emerge from generation to generation, how many factions are there? Seeking a doctor as if thirsty, worshiping when hearing goodness, illness is too great, creating enemies is great, Zhang Yuan's westward journey, is what the past generations warned about!</p>
<p>In youth, spirit is strong, worries and joys are too numerous, easily angered and easily moved, true feelings cannot be controlled, only sincerity can be measured, foolishness is not willing to be played with, forgive those who cross the line, do not wrongly condemn those who are kind, taking ten thousand and receiving one thousand, may exhaust its use!</p>

<p>Recently, Tian Jun came to Ping to handle school affairs, and his conversation with guests was very interesting and alerting. He said: "In the past, teachers managed students, but now students manage teachers." Tian Jun is now in the education authority, but in his early years, he was the one being educated.</p>
<p>According to our generation's education era, small school disturbances were unavoidable, there was no such thing as a student movement, nor was there any organization of self-government associations. Each class elected a class leader, and matters related to public affairs were discussed by the students, and the class leader reported to the authorities. Generally, in a school, apart from the teachers in each class, the most closely related to the students were one being "Educational Affairs" and the other being "Management". The name of the manager might be "Dean of Residence", "Residence Supervisor", and "Supervisor of Studies", which is now "Dean of Students" and "Director of Student Affairs". Because they have the responsibility of guiding, supervising, admonishing students' character, behavior, food, lodging, and hygiene, they are of the same status as the ancient "Guards and Mentors" and "Teachers". Although they do not teach, they are also "teachers", and their nature is different from "General Affairs and Logistics".</p>
<p>In the old days, students occasionally had requests, such as dissatisfaction with textbooks or teachers, which led to conflicts, which mostly concerned educational affairs. The educational affairs office had the principal above, the teachers on the side, and the students below, and each level spent a lot of energy. However, the residence affairs office (or supervisor) followed the rules and did not have any particularly worrying issues. However, in the past twenty or thirty years, it has been exactly the opposite. The school has a student self-government association, and the self-government association resolves to strike. Although the teachers are in class, there is no one, and if they decide to march, the administrators can only stare blankly aside and cannot stop them. If any accidents occur outside the school, or there are conflicts with the local authorities and detentions, then bailing them out, comforting them, etc., they will be too busy to handle. Therefore, the "Dean of Students" of today and the "Supervisor of Studies" of the past differ in ease and hardship by more than can be measured.</p>
<p>The two words "manage" and "teach" have always been connected. The teachers in the old private schools also "taught" and "managed", combining the two in one. Just look at the play "The Peony Pavilion Disturbs the School". Chen Zuiliang, because Miss Du arrived at the school late, first reprimanded the girl for the things that women should wake up early and the things about the discipline of women, which is "Guidance". Then he explained the Book of Songs, first the words, then the great meaning, which is "Teaching". In modern-style schools, there are many people and the organization is tight, so educational affairs and management must be divided. However, the teacher managing the students is still the same. Even in today's primary and secondary schools, it is still the case, especially in primary schools. The dignity of the teacher and the obedience of the students are not much different from the old days, but in specialized schools and universities, the atmosphere has changed dramatically.</p>
<p>I remember in the first year of the Republic of China, Dr. Yan Jidao took office as the president of Peking University, and invited Liang Rengong to give a speech to the entire school in the auditorium. Yan said: Now it is the Republic of China, and the people have freedom, which is recorded in the provisional constitution. However, there are only two types of people who cannot have freedom: one is the army, and the other is the students. The reason is that only because they do not know something and cannot do something, they enter the school to ask the teachers for advice. If they think that what they know and can do is above the teachers and do not obey the rules, then why enter the school? Liang advised them in three points: (1) obedience, (2) tranquility, and (3) opportunity; learning can be successful, and entering the school is not in vain. Are the words of the above two great celebrities now things of the past?</p>
