<h3>柏林危機的惡化</h3>
<p>柏林的危機在東歐發生荻托之變時，雖會因蘇聯將德境東西交通局部解禁而一度趨於緩和，但是事變繼續發展到今日，却又每况愈下，大有急轉直下之勢。甚至英國防大臣辛威爾也說：「柏林的局勢，實富於爆炸性，所幸目前尚無人願關第一槍。」僅從此寥寥數語，也可以看出柏林危機的惡化了。</p>
<p>放眼看看最近幾件驚心動魄的事件：第一是美國超空堡壘六十架的飛抵英倫，美國空軍人員隨着超空堡壘行抵英國的，已達一千五百人之多，將使用英法兩國的空軍基地；不論美國方面如何解釋，對於蘇聯終究是一種示威的行動。第二是西歐聯盟五國外長會議已於昨日在海牙開幕，荷比盧三國也將派遣飛機參加柏林的空運，以示西歐集團各國的行動一致。第三是美國的新計劃，擬以武裝打開柏林的封鎖，至必要時並將對蘇聯實施經濟制裁。此項計劃一俟英·法·荷·比·盧五國表示贊同，即將向莫斯科提出新照會，再度要求蘇聯立即解除柏林的封鎖，否則西方盟國將依照預定計劃採取行動。而在條聯方面，對於柏林空運，也加於施行其威脅的措置，間將以運輸機及戰鬥機在柏林上空演習，並將柏林的三條空中走廊封鎖其二，使西方盟國不能再用空運的方法接濟柏林，看一般的趨勢，蘇聯固欲一意孤行到底，西方盟國也不願妥協，柏林危機的劍拔弩張，確已到了雙方攤牌的階段了。</p>
<p>自從西德協定在倫敦簽字成立後，西歐盟　即在西德實行幣制改革，使蘇聯在德國不得不採取有力行動，乃對柏林採取「冷圍」的戰略，切斷英美法三區的水電供應及鐵路交通，造成柏林的嚴重危機，企圖將英美法三國的勢力逐出柏林的門外，以抵消西德協定所造成的影響。詎意蘇聯對柏林實行「冷圍」，立即引起西方盟國的嚴重反響，美國國務院公然指斥蘇聯對柏林的「冷　」是一種「片面的挑戰行爲」，德境美軍總司令克萊將軍也以堅決的口吻說：「蘇聯現正實施其最後的壓力企圖將我們逐出柏林；但無論如何，除非訴諸戰爭，蘇聯採取任何行動，都是不會成功的」。僅從克萊將軍的一席話看來，即可知西歐盟國對蘇聯封鎖柏林讓步，根本就不可能的。</p>
<p>誰都不能否隠，柏林危機的惡化，足以構成歐洲和平的嚴重威脅；故在蘇聯對柏林實行「冷　」之後，英美與論界早就」致要求各該國政府强硬對付蘇聯，英美法三國政府對於蘇聯的「冷　」，也莫不萬分重視，在五月抄，早就想對草斯科採取聯合行動，要求蘇聯立即無條件解除其對柏林的「冷　」，並欲警告蘇聯，如若堅持其目前在柏林所採取的策略，則必造成嚴重的後果。但當三國政府正欲向莫斯科提出抗議之際，歐洲共產國際情報局突然決議開除南斯拉夫狄托元帥的黨籍，不僅東歐「鐵幕」發生裂痕，而且也引起了南蘇兩國關係的惡化；因此蘇聯的視綫由柏林移至貝爾格萊特，乃對德境東西交通局部解禁，使柏林的危機頓趨緩和。惟爲時未久，南蘇關係漸趨澄淸，蘇聯在柏林的行動，不僅「故態復明」，恢復對柏林的「冷圍」，而且變本加厲，甚至要阻止西歐盟國的空運柏林了。英美法三國乃被迫於七月八日向莫斯科提出抗議。</p>
<p>英美法三强對蘇抗議的要點，綜合起來，有下列各項：（一）指出蘇聯對柏林的封鎖，已造成嚴重之國際局勢；（二）建議由四强進行談判，討論解除此項封鎖之條件，但四强重開談判，必須蘇聯先行解除其對柏林之封鎖；（三）聲明任何佔領國如欲對柏林居民實施封鎖，均屬不可容忍者；（四）透露杜（魯門）史（丹林）邱（吉爾）三巨頭於一九四五年六月十四日秘密協定的內容，美軍經由鐵路公路及航空進入柏林之權，曾獲得史丹林的切實保障，今日蘇聯之封鎖，實爲違背諾言之舉。時隔一週，蘇聯始提出覆文，拒絕解除柏林的封鎖，並將造成現行局勢的責任諉諸西方明國。雙方意見不啻南轅北轍，絕無妥協希望，使西方盟國不得不考慮「下一步驟」。</p>
<p>這個「下一步驟」經過英美法三强的縝密考慮，若欲打破柏林的封鎖，則必須採取下列幾項步驟：（一）將柏林對鎖事件提交海牙國際法庭處理，以確立西方三强駐在柏林的合法性及還輪供應品經過蘇軍佔領區至柏林之權利。如若雙方均有遵守國際公法及條約的精神，均有和平解決的誠意，則此一步驟，最合理想；但在蔑視法紀的强權時代，國際法庭的確立合法性及其權利，在實際上仍是無意義可言的。　由聯合國安全理事會，根據其調查威脅國際和平的條款，處理此一事件。聯合國秘書長賴伊早就在那裏考慮，「要求安全理事會討論柏林的危機」，但是遲遲未見諸事實，乃由於此舉對於解除柏林封鎖無補所致，良以蘇聯在安全理事會內握有否決權，對於任何決定均可行使其否決權。（三）對蘇聯採取强硬報復辦法，以武裝打破柏林的封鎖，必要時可採取武力，以試驗蘇聯的封鎖力量，或實行經濟制裁，迫令蘇聯就範。但這種行爲，終不免太危險，足以引起意料不到的後果。</p>
<p>綜上所述，西方盟國對付蘇聯的「冷圍」，幾乎無路可走，和平方法旣難奏效，强硬手段又嫌危險；何去何從，眞値得西方盟國鄭重考慮。惟所謂西方盟國，不可諱言的，將唯美國馬首是瞻，美國的意見足以左右一切。美國政府即已決定召集國會舉行特別會議，共和黨議員也要求討論美蘇關係，對於如何挽救柏林的新危機，自應從絕境中求得一條出路來。全世界屛息以待柏林局勢轉危爲安的人民，都在盼望美國國會能採取明快而堅決的措置。</p>

<h3>甘省老君廟油礦　月產石油七十餘萬介侖今後新設施準備實現中</h3>
<p>〔本報老君廟十五日航訊〕中油甘靑分公司老君廟油礦，原係甘肅油礦改組而成。該礦創於抗戰時，器材缺乏，一切因陋就爾，大半以舊廢材料勉强完成，而所打之井亦因戰時需油孔急，生產過量，已瀕枯竭。</p>
<p>勝利以來，西北軍運，需油仍股，和年總公司派協理鄧可詮主持該礦，鄧力謀改進，添建新煉廠，提高成品質量，開鑿新井，充裕原油供應，廣探油田，以奠石油基礎。惟二年來交通便阻，材料還濟困難，物價日漲，資金常感週轉不靈，幸經主持人深謀遠慮，各級員工同心協力，在極短之兩年間，卒能完成裂化蒸溜煉油廠二處，添打新井二餘公尺，推廣礦區四倍以上，並在甘靑兩省探獲新油　數處，誠麗不易。</p>
<p>該礦自去年十月後，每月產量均保持最高紀錄，上月生產七十餘萬介侖，尤可驚人，翁院長特電慰勉。該礦油田，面積三千英畝，先後鑿井三十九口，目前出油者十五口，本年擬　之新井十口，十月前完成出油，已有把握。</p>
<p>礦區面積約七十平方公里，各種房屋六千餘問，員工連眷，共約九千人。目前每月經費約九萬四千三百億，大部爲擴充事業之用，購運國外器材，尚不在內。員工薪津，不足千億。礦區除生產管理部門外，尚有醫院，浴室，劇塲，報社，中小學，工訓班，及陶瓷，磚瓦，土木，麪粉等日用品製造部門，舉凡衣，食，住，行，文化，娛樂，均有設備，故員工雖處漫無人烟之戈壁中，仍能安心工作，大多均願獻身石油事業。該礦口號除資委會之「公」「誠」外，另加「拼」，各部員工之忠於事業，勤愼服務，至足感人。</p>

<h3>西歐五國外長秘密會商應付柏林危局對策皮杜爾主張恢復四強談判　北大西洋聯防制亦愼重加以研討</h3>
<p>〔合衆社海牙十九日電〕法外長皮杜爾十九日爲白魯塞爾公約會議揭開序幕時，呼籲歐洲其他國家參加　歐聯盟，渠深望西歐聯盟擴大爲全歐聯盟。英法比荷盧五國外長在柏林危局聲中，在此間外交部舉行首次會議，檢討聯盟之進展，會議可望迅速解決軍事聯防之循行報告，然後鄭重討論德國及對付蘇聯威脅圖迫西方盟國退出柏林之方策。皮杜爾可望敦促恢復四强之討論，先恢復盟管會，最後則重開外長會議。皮杜爾演說後，記者卽被請離席，續關秘密會議。十九日午後之會議絕端秘密，討論柏林危局。英外部對德專家第恩今晨自倫敦飛此出席午後會議。若干官員暗示最後結果恐爲召開外長會議，專事討論德國，然無人願如此聲明而削弱對蘇談判之力量。上午會議決定特設經濟財政委員會，於下午開會覓取實際方針。</p>
<p>〔路透社海牙十九日電〕西歐聯盟五國外長，十九日起在荷蘭外交部內舉行爲期兩日之秘密會議，柏林危機及華盛頓七國會談暫擬的北大西洋聯防計劃，乃會中主要討論事項。與會五國外長乃英外相貝文·法外長皮杜爾·比外長史巴克·荷外長波茨勒·盧外長貝克，係以西歐聯盟咨詢委員會委員之身份參與會議。荷外長波茨勒以主人地位致歡迎辭，表示荷比盧三國，將永遠感激貝文外相之使西歐聯盟成爲事實，荷比盧同時亦歡迎得有此一機會，以充分參加英美就柏林危機所採之行動。波氏談及西數聯盟之軍事聯防協定時，表示此約如係保衛西歐所必需，實不容再事躊躇，應速使其成爲事實。貝文嗣起立致答辭，希望荷比盧得就德國問題充分與英國合作，相信美國對於此等合作亦甚歡迎。貝文强調指出西歐國家之首要任務，在使本身保持自由，但同時應勿忘德國亦爲西方國家之責任，決不容暴戾勢力在該處橫行。渠繼日，「當余初次在下議院中提出西歐聯盟之問題，距今不過六個月，今已獲有此等進展，殊令人欣慰，吾等均在盡力建立此一偉大的聯盟，吾人必須分擔此項工作的光榮」。開幕儀式完壘後，五國外長即開始鄭重硏究美加英美荷比盧七國代表在華盛頓草擬之北大西洋區域防衛制度，及西歡聯盟永久軍委會之報告。午餐時休息，下午繼續以西歐聯盟政策之立塲，討論一般國際局勢。貝文並將與皮杜爾個別會談交換關於柏林危機之意見。英大使館昨夜設宴招待貝文時，加拿大駐荷大使·南非澳洲駐荷公使及印度巴基斯坦之外交代表均與席，貝文即席報告此次海牙會議之概况，並允諾將開會情形充分通知英共和邦諸國。</p>
<h3>柏林局勢演變迫焦點蘇聯目標在魯爾　三強今後行動有特海牙會結果</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫教十九日電〕英官方人士今日稱，西方三國在蘇聯解除柏林封鎖之前，將拒絕與蘇聯參加任何討論，柏林問題如此，其他問題亦如此。英美法三國答覆蘇聯上週之覆文時，諒將作此表示。西方之覆文可能將於本週末或下週初在三國京城遞交蘇聯大使，顯然必在英外相貝文二十日晚自海牙會議歸來以後。英外部發言人在循例招待紀者時宣稱，三國猶未決定次一步驟，甚至是否擬再度照會蘇聯，亦未決定。然渠又稱，此言並非宣佈不擬再度照會，「現在考慮每一可能之步驟」。</p>
<p>發言人重申第一次抗議所稱在柏林封鎖解除前，四强無再度對論之可言，渠稱，此係專指柏林之四强司令會議而言。其他又有官方人士稱，西方「絕不致」同意與蘇聯在他處討論德國問題，如外長會議之類，直至柏林「冷圍」解隊爲止。某人士稱，「若然，則吾人將處於談判之劣勢」。雖討諭重心已移海牙，英外次史特朗美大使陶格拉斯及法大使瑪西格里仍在倫敦縱續討論柏林危局。消息靈通人士稱，英美法三國現所考慮者有一項爲致蘇最後通牒，另一爲派遣裝列甲車或武裝貨車護送隊載運糧食突破柏林封鎖，且曾討論向安理會及國際法庭上訴。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十九日電〕政治觀察家稱：目前柏林局勢之演變已臨焦點，然爭持之基點，無疑爲永久控制魯爾區問題。蘇聯希望開發魯爾，可自渠再三要求四強共管魯爾區中見之，但西方强國則亦再三拒絕。</p>
<p>柏林之局勢在本質上，實係政治性者，蘇聯在柏林四强司令會議中採用阻礙議事之策略，逼使三强建立西德合併區，即着眼於立即將三强逐出柏林，蓋蘇聯如能控制柏林，即表示渠已掌握此八千萬德國人民均公認爲德國首都之中心。第二步爲策動散佈德國各地之衛星政黨，要求德國在蘇聯控制之柏林政府下「統一」，如此舉成功則蘇聯殆將控制魯爾區可告無疑。盟方亦洞悉其目的，並知假以聲色，柏林不過爲其起始點。蘇聯之第二步爲逐盟邦出德國全境，是故政治觀察家認爲西方將冒儺戰之險，堅持留駐柏林。</p>
<h3>美空中覇王機增強柏林空運</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十八日電〕可靠方面息：空中覇王式巨型機七十架，不久將自美調德，增强西德與柏林間之空運。此等飛機每次可載貨十噸，如每日往來三次，則可使空運量每日爲之增加二千一百噸。現在德境服務之空中覇王機已有六十架。又據蘇聯控制之柏林電台稱，柏林—海姆斯台特鐵路路軌已被拆除者約十哩，蘇官員上週曾表示，該綫枕木多已腐爛，必須更換，但修理工程將儘速使其完成。</p>
<h3>德境蘇集中營囚禁男女萬臺</h3>
<p>灌輸列寗馬克斯主義</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十八日電〕英佔區「世界日報」今日刋載關於蘇聯布慶華特集中營情形之文章一篇，據稱，「在一九四八年四月被蘇聯秘密警察拘禁於該集中營者有一萬人，包括女子一百七十名。被囚於集中營者大多爲社民黨·基督敎民主黨與自由黨黨員，以及公務人員等，罪名多爲充任西方盟國之間諜。被囚者均不知何日可獲釋放。集中營中又禁止工作，終日無所事事，每日之口糧爲麵包三百克，清湯兩碗。被囚者均與外界隔絕，每三月發下關於馬克斯或列寗之著作一本，命令囚犯閱讀·每月　由蘇聯長官來集中營演說，內容均關於政治，蘇陛革命，蘇聯之改革蘇德在歷史上之關係等等。</p>
<h3>美超空堡壨　六十架全部抵英</h3>
<p>〔路透社英格蘭林肯城十九日電〕飛歐暫駐英國之美國超空　壘六十架，已抵英國者已有五十八架，最後兩架已於今日抵達目的地。英國人民對戰時盟友之重返英種，予以熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>〔聯合社英國史剛普頓十八日電〕據空軍新聞處宣布：美國機員留在史剛普頓。華盛頓與馬漢各機傷候命。歐洲美空軍司令李梅之代表華雷，昨自德國抵此指揮美機。美國機員今日忙於整理飛機及卸下箱籠，內裝修理材料與其他配備。</p>
<h3>英巨型運輸機自動長程飛航</h3>

<p>〔聯合社洛杉磯十八日電〕美空軍四引擎運輸機一架，已完成第三次自動長程飛行，該機自伊沃　州之韋明頓飛行二千一百哩抵此，腰時不足十二小時。其間機員十人吃飯下棋睡覺，無所事事，絕不觸及控制機。</p>
<h3>南國遭羅阿抵制轉向英美購石油　波蘭拒絕出席南共大會</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日合衆電〕外交界訊，南斯拉夫正擬向西方國家聯買石油，蓋羅馬尼亞及阿爾巴尼亞均抵制南國，不售予汽油，在狄托與克林姆宮衝突之前，南國所需汽油係來自蘇聯者，消息靈通人士稱，南斯拉夫終已向特港方面英美近東石油公司代理人接洽購油事宜，聞雙方已獲致暫時協議，惟交易之最後安排尚未完成。同時美官員稱，現有更多證據，足證蘇聯希望藉不斷之經濟壓迫推翻狄托。此間預測，狄托與克里姆林宮之鬥爭，將在今後十二日內只爾格勒舉行兩項會議時產生新發展，此二項會議爲：（一）廿一日召開之南共大曾，（二）卅日召開之十國多瑙河航行自由會議。</p>

<h3>法國會信任表決　許曼可渡難關</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十九日電〕法國民議會生席前總理赫禮歐，十九日負起重任，岡在最後一分鐘挽救政府，使能安渡下午信任投票之難關。赫氏以元老身份，圖使其急進社會黨在削减軍事預算一舉上更爲折衷。渠急召黨內三領袖前總理台爾塼斯。司法部長馬禮及蓋錫葉，共商一小時之久。會後亦無宣佈，惟傳彼等以爲可勸令黨員改變意見，獲致折衷而維持現政府。赫氏之行動使局勢頓告樂觀。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十九日電〕國民議會於十九日就國防預算案舉行許曼總理要求之信任案表決，一般觀察預料政府可獲比較多數之信任票，蓋在目前國際局勢緊張之時，社會黨及急進黨當不願爲削城預算而使政府垮台。許受昨曾與現在海牙之外長皮杜爾通長途電話，商討國內政局。</p>
<h3>蘇空軍實力與美國相埒　但缺乏航綫設備</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕世界航空年鑑載稱：蘇聯空軍實力與美國相仿，蘇聯有龐大而近代的飛機工業，但缺乏飛機塲及航綫設備。此年鑑係一新出版物，對於世界各國之民用及軍用航空，叙述頗爲詳細，約共包括一百國之多。蘇聯空軍估計有飛　一　　子　，人員四十萬。飛機中有噴射式機戴百架，B29型超空堡壘至少一百架，軍用機百分之四十二係戰鬬機。蘇聯之戰略轟炸隊即遠程轟炸機數，實力單薄，亦無航空母艦可作前進基地。機塲數百處，設備完善者不滿五十，甚至在較大都市中之機塲亦缺乏完整之跑道·飛機庫·及相當之客運終點站。除雪設備欠佳，一部份機塲在冬季不能使用，各航空綫幾全無燈火設備，實際祗能在白畫飛行。</p>
<h3>英美法三司令會商建立西德國計劃　否認考慮武裝突破封鎖</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十九日電〕英美法駐德軍事長官今晨在柏林英軍總部內開會討論進一步實施建立西德國之計劃，並者慮西德十一邦總理對倫敦會議建議所提出之反建議。法駐德軍事長官寇尼許特自西德專機趕到參加會議。當柏林危機漸趨緊張之際，戰時美國謀報部長杜文少將昨在柏林發表談話，主張對蘇聯及其與國實施經濟制裁，渠謂雖有空運制度，終屬一時之計，美國必須成立決議，雖有戰爭亦所不惜。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十九日電〕美官方發言人十九日晚否認英美法軍事總督將討論派遣武裝護送隊或火車通過蘇佔區打破封鎖之計劃。</p>

<h3>聯合國機構一大勝利阿盟接受停戰令　惟仍拒絕承認猶太國之存在</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕阿拉伯聯盟政治委員會在巴黎之阿萊舉行秘密會議後，已由貝魯特正式宣布阿拉伯之接受巴勒斯坦之休戰。阿拉伯人士强調阿樂雖接受休戰，但仍拒絕水　圖猶太國之存在。</p>
<p>復曰：報紙及輿論雖反對接受休戰·但阿盟以未便忽略諸强之意志，故決定接受休戰。阿盟政委會於法定接受休戰後，即由埃總理諾拉　致電羅特島貝那多特之總部。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖十九日電〕阿拉伯同盟國家今晚致電聯合國秘書長賴伊，聲明接受安理會之巴勒斯坦停戰令，惟附有條件三項即：（一）在休戰期中，猶太方面停止移民工作；（二）阿拉伯人民可於此期間還鄉，其生命及財產，務須予以保障；（三）休戰期限，必須確定。發電人爲同盟秘書長阿柴姆。猶太當局已在阿拉伯同盟之先接受休戰令，惟對阿方之三項條件，則必反對聯合國調人或安理會予以接受。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十八日電〕巴勒斯坦停戰令居然被阿猶雙方接受，一般人視此爲聯合國機構之最大勝利，聯合國以前雖曾兩次促成停戰（一次對印尼，一次對巴勒斯坦），但均出以呼籲方式，不若此次正式援用憲章發令，此乃安理會權力之重大試練。阿拉伯接受停戰令之通如係在規定時限下午三時（標準時間）後數小時達到。</p>
<h3>美訓練南韓軍隊　此一地方隊伍正迅速擴展中　韓國會今選舉正副總統</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城十九日電〕美國正默默在南韓建立地方軍隊，其大小尚屬秘密，然稍具目力者，均可看到此一支軍隊在迅速擴展中。田野間，綠衣兵士時有操演，漢城街道中少數軍人兩兩並列歌唱往來。此一組織各義爲「朝鮮巡警」，然與正規軍之分野實不甚顯明。巡警常稱，美軍撤退時，將留下卡軍及兵器，蓋美國曾保證維持朝鮮國家且賦予軍旅也。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城十九日電〕韓國國會於休會兩日後，定明晨秘密投票選舉大韓民國總統。韓國政府之組織至此可趨於具體化，副總統之選舉，則定明日下午舉行，各政黨之間，對總理人選以及國務會議（亦即內閣）干一位部長之抉擇，預料需經兩週商談，始可協議。故政府之組織，約在八月十五日以前可以完畢。按諸韓國憲法，各部部長及總理皆由總統任命，唯總理人選需經國會同意，李承晚博士及李始榮（前重慶韓國臨時政府國務委員）預料必可當選爲正副總統。徐載弼氏，原爲李承晚勁敵，唯現已聲明不參加競選，即如當選，亦將拒絕接受。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十九日電〕社會民主黨主席片山哲發表聲明，表示欲在最近未來臨時議會揭幕後，要求解散議會事，使日本政界，頗受震動，對於戀棧之蘆田首相，不啻冷水澆頭。片山哲於本洲北部仙台發表之聲明，加重蘆田內閣之危機。片山之聲明，表明社民黨擬於議會開始後，與第一大反對黨民主自由黨合作，要求解散議會，並使此案通過，佔領當局對解散議會問題，持何態度，尚不可知。總之，此項動議，旣尚須視察總部態度如何而定，故可能遭遇否決，而不得提出議會。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十九日電〕頃據接近日內閣秘書長之人士傳，內閣方面預備在九月上旬召集臨時國會，並似已決定在召集之日即遭遇解散之重大問題。在臨時國會中所將討論之各項法案，多半係與勞動問題有關者，而就此等問題民主及國民協同兩黨與社會黨之意見係立於絕對相反之立塲。</p>

<h3>美總統大選展望（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>民主黨目前競選形勢之不利，不僅爲杜魯門缺乏聲望，遠溯自羅斯福時代之外交錯誤，已逐漸爲共和黨輿論界揭發。美國人士每一提及柏林事變，每一提及捷克政變，均憤憤於所謂「雅爾達密約」。具有普遍銷路之「郵報週刋」，曾有一長文論捷克政變，完全由於雅爾達密約規定：「納椊佔領下易北河以東之各國首都，均將交由蘇俄紅軍解放」，因之，巴頓將軍兵臨普拉格城下，仍坐待蘇聯先來佔領，以致有今日之後果。日前紐約銷數最大之「每日新聞」社評，謂今日柏林之僵局，亦由於雅爾達密約規定易北河以東首都概由紅軍解放一語所造成。美國人民每一念及雅爾達密約之恥辱，對民主黨之外交政策，無不表示失望。上月費城舉行之共和黨全國代表大會席上，有人曾公開痛駡羅斯福，從羅斯福駡到杜魯門。</p>
<p>馬歇爾國務卿之剛愎自用，動作散亂，亦爲造成杜魯門不利形勢之一主要原因。巴勒斯坦問題，杜魯門政府之外交政策一再變換，到頭來匆匆忙忙，來一個不倫不類的「承認」，使美國國內的猶太籍人民爲之失望。又譬如史密斯大使在莫斯科的「換文」，惹起英法大反感，均爲極不智之冒失舉動。對華外交，出爾反爾，引起共和黨之大大抨擊。無論就何角度觀察，杜魯門馬歇爾之盲動外交，已使美國人民感覺厭倦。</p>
<p>在共和然方面，杜威在全國代表大會以前之多次演講，對外交原則，簡單扼要，目標鮮明。但杜咸對任何記者友人，皆謙虛稱：「個人不諳外交，一切當請敎余之顧問　斯脫，杜勒斯」。在杜威所擬未來內閣之名單中，國務卿一席，首屬范登堡，如范登堡不就，當請杜勒斯。予美國人士一鮮明興奮之印象。</p>
<p>如純就外交政第及對華外交而言，杜威如當選，當爲對中國有利之事，杜成於每次演說中，必提及加緊援助中國，在渠十四點政　中，「援華」特標明爲一點。杜威並曾提醒美國外交人士，尊重中國蔣主席之領導地位，爲一切援助之先決條件，當爲十分睿智之見解</p>
<p>共和黨正副總統候選人杜威（右）華倫（左）</p>
<h3>日前宮內相　松平慶民病逝</h3>

<h3>潘興將軍　昨日國葬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕杜魯門總統今日蒞國會大禮堂，瞻仰潘興上將遺容。第一次大戰時代，杜魯門爲潘興麾下砲兵軍官，今日即以舊部資格，向潘帥致最後敬禮。明日潘帥遺體下葬亞林頓墓時，則將以總統資格參加。政府要人國務部長馬歇爾·睦長羅雅爾與參謀總長勃雷特萊亦均隨總統至禮堂，馬歇爾　視遺容良久，當年馬歇爾爲靑年軍官時，潘興稱之爲「我的小孩子」，馬歇爾後升至參謀總長。</p>

<h3>行總職員舞弊案地院更審兩被告　候藹昌力白住屋並非贈送　蔣仁麟辯備用金爲曾短少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總高級職員被控集團貪汚案，經地院初審判決：侯藹昌·蔣仁麟各處有期徒刑三年其餘被告董承道等，分別判無罪及免訴。侯·蔣兩被告不服，請求復判，經高院審核，對侯藹昌電風扇棉花部份，均予核准，認贈房屋一點認爲判決錯誤，發回地院更審。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民食調配會優待新聞從業員特種配米，本月份起特印發特種配售證，規定得向本人所領計口配售米證規定區內之任何糧食配售店購買食米，詎各區一部份米店竟發生拒售情事。此項米店或未明法令，或誤解特種配米之意義，或甚且有故意多方留難者，新聞從業員身受其累，憤慨之餘，成盼民調會當局從速調查，迅加有效改善。</p>

<h3>從唐太宗說到花樹業　根據一段神話定每月十二爲集會之期　辛亥革命老周志「領袖羣芳」</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕相傳唐太宗李世民，酷嗜花卉，於陰勝二月十二日「命令」百花齊放，結果眞的如願以償，武則天女皇雖也照樣「命令」一次，但別的花全開了，獨有牡丹不放，於是被貶到洛陽，據說，現在任何一處的牡丹花總及不上洛陽，也說不出是什麽道理，而花樹業的定每年二月十二日爲花神生日，除掉拿上面的神話來解釋外，也是無從「考據」的。今年的花神生日，本市花樹業同業公會曾舉行盛大廟會，把抗戰期間避難在滬西的花神，接供到斜橋麗園路的公會舊址裏，每年此日多有隆重祀典，但爲了公會會員問的聯繫便利，現在已規定陰曆每月十二日都舉行集會，一面在花神前燒燒香，一面則商討會務。前天是陰曆十二日，記者亦適逢其會，從許多會裏的負責人處，搜集到不少趣味資料。</p>
<p>四十年來從事園藝</p>
<p>堪稱爲花樹業巨擊，要算是該業理事長黃岳淵，一個辛亥革命的老同志，近四十年來，他埋頭從事花樹園藝的研究，本市康平路的黃　，就是他的心血結晶，裏面植滿了珍草奇卉，另外在眞茹，他還有一處佔地達三百多畝的大園塲，他自己承認，單是些花樹的價値，在今天是沒法估計的。</p>
<p>就月季花說，他園子車就有八十多種，二千多株，即連前年在美國繁殖去年比賽今年出售的一九四八年的最新品種月季花，他因着自己的孩子到美國求學時替美國朋友帶了一方地氈去，而換得了六株，現在已繁殖到十八株，它的時値每株約需美金五元，其他普通品種，也要售到三五角，色分紫·黃·大紅·硃砂紅……姿態美，香味好，這些爲外國人所最喜愛的花朶的價値，是足以使我們瞠目咋舌的。好品種的月季花，多由美國人分別以世界名人命名，有羅斯福·杜魯門等人，也有我國總統夫人宋美齡，多至十餘種，而黃氏的園子裏能搜羅得一種不缺，其名貴就更可想見了。</p>
<p>產生出不少花師傳</p>
<p>還有難得一覩的黃黑牡丹，爲了以前公開任人參觀，結果被人偸竊一空，現在黃氏已把它藏諸密室，輕易不肯示人，其他有所謂「十二金釵」「五大夫松」等盆栽，在愛花成癖的此道中人說，好的花樹給他們看到，簡直就會廢寢忘食，生活在裏面，就等於置身圖書中，這種樂趣，別人絕對體味不到的。</p>

<h3>從九死一生的砲火中出來的　四平虎將彭鍔</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　楊益明</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州十八日訊〕記得遠在抗職初期日寇侵滬的時候，駐軍八十八師二六二旅五二四團團附謝晋元，營長楊瑞符率領八百狀士，孤軍堅守四行倉庫，掩護大軍撤退，這一羣驚犬地泣鬼神的四行孤軍，曾經喧傳世界，幾乎成爲神話中的英雄。這種勇敢善戰視死如歸的精神，由該團繼任團長彭鍔將軍一分不减的保留下來，並且擴大培養，使這榮譽的八十八師，到彭氏升任師長守衛四平的時候，再度充分發揮保持着傳統的光榮。</p>
<p>軍功纍纍</p>
<p>五二四團團長韓憲元，不久就在南京花台一役殉國了，繼任者就是彭將軍。自廿七年春間起，轉戰隴海沿綫，武漢外圍，三晋東南各處，因軍功累升至八十七師師長。卅三年抗戰反攻，彭氏率領所部健兒，遠征滇緬，充分表現了中國陸軍的戰鬥力，曾因攻佔芒市畹町有功，獲得最高領袖的激賞。</p>
<p>勝利後，彭氏奉派爲蘇北南通，海門地區的受降長官兼防守司令，降俘剿匪，措置威宜，不久奉調東北，收復八面城及遼陽，通遼諸地。卅六年五月，彭氏奉調原來的八十八師師長駐防四平，未幾共匪來犯，率部苦戰了四十二天，腿背中彈，裹血指揮，終於擊退了頑固的匪軍，這一次使彭氏對於四平的地理形勢，攻守情形，獲得了充分的實地經驗，實爲後來二次保衛四平完成任務後得能率部突圍成功的主因。</p>
<p>孤軍戰鬥</p>
<p>今春二月，共匪集合了六個縱隊，五個獨立師，一個砲兵旅，擁有重砲，高射砲，戰車等新式武器，再度在東北發動瘋狂攻勢，首先攻陷開源，逐步完成對四平的合圍，這時彭氏率部駐防四平，奉命堅守，以掩護吉長大軍集結南撤，成全東北大局，於是率領了僅僅所部二團步兵，迎擊十五倍優勢的匪軍，前仆後繼，使匪軍對每寸土地，都付出了最大的代價。</p>
<p>可是當任務達成後，孤軍已在層層重圍之中，原定自空運撤退的計劃也成泡影。二月廿九日，共匪開始總攻四平，重砲數十門，輪番猛轟，並且利用戰軍，掩護衝鋒，戰鬥極形慘烈，匪兵到處鑽隙突入，勢如洪水。至三月十三日，各據點均已陷入匪手，市區一片火海，各方關懷的四平孤軍，消息斷絕。</p>
<p>突圍成功</p>
<p>三月十五日，匪方向世界廣播戰果，說四平的守軍已全部就殲，守將彭鍔戰死，這消息在當時確可以淆或聽聞，在瀋陽的彭氏友好，已籌備爲彭氏開起追悼會了，忽然，驚人的消息傳來，彭氏竟已率部透過匪二百四十里的多層包圍圈，突圍出來了，這不能不說是一個奇蹟。彭氏與副師長黃文徽，身邊僅存衛士十九人，於十六日傍晚抵達鐵嶺，眞是九死一生，疲困欲絕，其後拖護突圍的壯士，絡續趕到，全部突圍官兵人數，居然還有一千三百餘人。</p>
<p>腿部負傷</p>
<p>這消息瘋狂了瀋陽各界，籌備中的追悼會立刻改爲歡迎會，瀋長平津各報，都像神話一般的記載這件事，譽彭氏爲「四平虎將」。不多日，彭氏奉召晋京，因爲腿部受有炸傷，入院醫治。彭氏是湖南人，現年三十八歲，黃埔六期畢業，結實的身體，充沛的精神，腿部傷勢雖不久就好了，但是走起路來，還有些蹣跚的樣子。</p>
<p>本月五日，彭氏奉派來蘇，接任靑年軍二〇二師師長，部署初定，便招待各界，提出了「愛民必先保民」的口號。二〇二師原是一支具有規模的新軍，現在由這一位虎虎有生氣的靑年將軍來領導，當有一番更英勇更偉大的作爲。</p>

<h3>碧血染淮河</h3>
<p>— 偉名</p>
<p>〔蕪湖訊〕盛夏的陽光在驕傲地逞威，麥子金黃了，農人們卡勤地在麥田裏收割，黝黑的面孔，展露着微笑。眞的，幾個月勞苦下半年的衣食就全靠這未來的收穫。可是，在河的彼岸的共匪，也同樣的垂涎這生活必須品，它們是毫無體恤和憫憐，何况在今年春間狠狠狽的跑過淮北，才喘過氣來，當然，又想來一次「劫收」啦。</p>
<p>搶糧之夢</p>
<p>共匪華東野戰軍十二縱隊卅四旅，今年三四月間在淮南竄擾時已被粤東勁旅靑神部隊擊敗，匪高級幹部陣亡的陣亡，被俘的被俘，述旅長廖成美也弄得下落不明，所以不得不竄回老巢靑陽整補。然而才不過兩個多月，由於食糧缺乏的威脅，匪酋就壓迫着那些無知的老百姓，重行走上沒有勝利希望的戰塲。</p>
<p>當然，匪徒這次渡河的目的在搶糧，六月二十七日由靑陽開始出發配備着一個團的實力，在七月一日偸渡淮河，乘着我軍普遍掩護民衆收割，兵力分散，就鑽隙襲擊皖省盯胎縣南山河岸一個周集鄉馬壩之北，前楊莊之南又叫後梁莊，它們探淸楚了我們在前後梁莊附近祗駐一個連，在十多里外鄉公所的自衛班祗有步槍四枝，於是先解決了自衛班，同時另一股匪預備伏擊我們增援部隊外，其餘大部兵力分爲六股向我陳連襲擊，匪的企岡是志在必得的，一日夜一時許，開始就用火箭砲迫擊砲集中轟擊數十砲之後，就各路衝鋒前進，幸而陳連長早有先見，預爲之備，除日間派隊掩護及協助收割之外，晚上連夜修補工事，各掩體間挖好交通壕，足以應付突然而來的襲擊。</p>
<p>首當其衝的是左翼X班長那班，因爲它們排山倒海而來，所以戰至後來，竟全班壯烈犧牲了。</p>
<p>於是匪軍逐漸迫近了，把前後梁莊重重包圍着，足徵匪徒已使用全部兵力了，雙方戰火更爲熾烈，首先少尉排長韋桂庭受了傷，陳連長紹先就親往指揮，仇恨之火燃燒着每一人的心胸，這時弟兄們傷了二十多個，全連的彈藥也消耗泰半，天還是黑沉沉的，匪徒用火箭砲發射燒夷彈，燃燒着我們的陣地，火光照得半天紅，月亮黯泣似地躱在層雲裏。</p>
<p>火網熾烈</p>
<p>匪徒更猛烈的衝鋒，然而寸土的前進是要付出鉅大的代價，爆炸聲不斷的隆隆地響着，夾着痛苦的哭聲；交織成了一支最悲慘的哀曲。我們的戰士，更加機敏而沉着的應戰，已經戰鬥了四個鐘頭了，緊張的情緒，使得每個戰士忘記了疲勞。當匪徒第五次衝鋒開始底時候，傷亡也愈軍了，可是依然拚死掙扎，雙方簡直完全用手榴彈戰鬥，我們的劉排長正中陣亡了，李排長甲昇負了傷，連長陳紹先身手兩處也掛了光榮的彩，然而我們的戰鬥意志愈加堅決。無恥的匪徒在外面卑劣地喊「繳槍吧！」幾個弟兄輕鬆地答：「好吧！行哩來吧！」（都是用廣東話問答。）等到匪徒，迫近碉堡時，，轟隆轟隆幾聲巨聲，使它們找到了滿意的歸宿。於是，其餘的匪徒見到我們陣地的堅强，便預測情報，不正確恐怕不止一連人吧！</p>
<p>正在晨光曦微的時候，匪徒終未得逞，於是便孤注一擲地來一次第六次攻勢，也就是最後一次最猛烈的衝出的時候，我們的援軍從兩側趕到了，這是出乎匪徒意料之外的；匪徒雖然預先分兵在公路上伏擊我們的援軍，可是我們靑神部隊的雷秀民少將，却料敵如神，指示赴援的一個營却由小路行軍，這樣無阻碍地適時趕到，把匪徒反包圍了。</p>
<p>當他們知道陷入重圍的危險時，眞是飛將軍從天降，這樣才愴惶逃走，然而一場春夢一塲空，匪徒拋棄在前後梁莊附近的屍骸竟達二百五十多具，被我們生擒的計匪官三十餘人，俘獲兵器甚夥，還有匪徒渡至半河被我擊沉的船隻六艘，葬身魚腹者不下百餘人，總計此役，匪軍又遭到嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>訪雷少將</p>
<p>夏的　風帶來了勝利的消息，喚起了整個淮南人民的精神，淮南民衆歡躍着，士紳，學生，商人……等，爭着慰問傷兵。</p>
<p>記者獲得勝利的消息後，立卽跑到司令部裏去訪問雷少將，他依然是那樣和靄可親地出來接見，他似乎有些倦意，可見昨夜前方的戰士苦鬥，這位勤謹的將軍始終運籌帷幄，指揮苦定。</p>
<p>接着，雷少將很客觀的分析此役勝利的因素，他說：「這次以少勝多，由於陳連長智勇膽識都很早有了準備，工事做得好。其次是指揮適當，援隊聽命，由小路抄進，出敵不意，但最主要的一個決定因素，還是將士用命。全體官兵都具有堅定不移的信念，有捨生取義的決心，這裏應該歸功於我們的參謀長，和政工室丘主任」並且立卽介紹我和黎副族長梁參謀長丘主任相見，他們三位都非常和靄，說話很客氣，尤其是對於他們的領導者—雷少將—和他們底客人，是那麼誠懇，那麼尊敬，使人在這裏簡直覺得好像在一個和睦的大家庭。　談到此役因而陣亡的劉排長正中，是廣東興寗人在一五三旅軍士隊畢業，平日對人很好，敎育弟兄能循循善誘，作起戰來每每身先士卒，使我們弟兄不得不欽佩，不得不跟着他更加勇敢。這次的犧牲誰不痛心呢？</p>
<p>我們充滿了怡　的心情，踏着輕快的步調走上歸程，晚霞柔和地照在淮水上面，燦爛的反射出金黃的光輝。</p>

<h3>贛籍雙身人　九歲隨父赴英美德法等國展覽　在美時拒絕接受醫生動用手術</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌十六日航訊〕贛籍「雙身人」劉聖階。劉聖隄，是奇怪而又眞實的人物。他倆都是男性，籍隸江西南康縣塘江圩，現年六十二歲。在記者年幼讀小學時，就在塘江看到他倆手挽肩膀的行街頭，有時兩人意見不投時，他們互鬥一陣，而互鬥的唯一武器，就是用手抓臉，所以兩人的臉部有時負了傷，靑一塊，紫一塊的，但是，過了一會兒，又復和好如初。　他倆之間的唯一聯系，是在脅部有一塊拳大的肉團，有時可能伸縮到寸許的距離，但這是不常有的現象。在他們從母胎產下之後，他的母親竹經用綫紮縛，使雙身分開，但頓時血脈停流，奄奄一息。　九歲時，他的父親把他們帶到外國去，曾在英·美·德·法·義等國展覽，並參加巴拿馬賽會，換得了榮譽的獎狀與英鎊</p>
<p>在美國時，曾經有一個醫生願意掏一百萬美金的代價，要他們開刀，以作科學的研究，可是，在那時正有一對「雙連的男女奇人」因施用手術而致斷命，把他們嚇怕了，所以堅決不肯接受美國醫生的請求</p>
<p>到十九歲時，他倆跟隨着父親和一位翻譯返國。在旅行途中，使他倆學會了一口流利的英語，但是祗能說而不會寫，這大概由爲雙身的阻碍而缺乏練習所致。</p>
<p>返國後，他倆又到國內各大都市，如北平·漢口·上海·廣州·香港，自後就息居在他們的故鄉——塘江圩，在這段壯年時代，他倆在家鄉會賭博，會做事。</p>
<p>現在，他倆的父母，均已去世，還有兩個「單身」的弟弟，以耕作爲業。</p>
<p>關於他倆的生活：——飲食，起居，與婚姻，亦是奇人的奇事，譬如：飲食方面，祗要一個人暍了酒，其他的一個，亦會醉上心頭。又如：暍了多量的茶，二人的小便便同時相當的多。但是，若是一個人吃飯，却不能同時均飽，而各人吃飯時掌箸的手勢，亦各不相同，一個是用本能的右手，左邊的一個却是相反的用左手，各人用左手或右手去扶碗。說話的時候，可以各自對答，而沒有同感。若是，一個生了病，兩人俱感不適，同臥一床。但是，吃藥不一定是各自一劑，今後的最後一關，—死，究竟怎樣，問他倆亦無以爲答。若是兩人之中，有一人因病致死，而另一人，却不能同時病亡的話，又該怎樣？所以有人說笑話：旣是同生，亦會同死，更要同棺。</p>
<p>在他倆生活過程中，還有一段有趣的性生活。他們曾經各娶過二個妻子，每天晚上都是六人同床，各有「趣夢」。現在每人祗有妻室一人，都有生育，劉聖階的兒子，現年廿餘歲，女兒十餘歲，劉聖隄，祗一個兒子，今年十七歲，都在家裏耕作。</p>
<p>現在他倆正在南昌以十五萬元門票收入，以作展覽，並擬赴滬舉行，以飽滬上人士的觀瞻，藉着生理上的怪現象，作爲生活的法門，這倒是現世界的怪事之一。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕央行昨日發行之大額關金，計爲一萬，二萬五千，及五萬三種；二十五萬之關金，因印製尚未完竣，發行尚有待。截至昨日爲止，大鈔流通市面之數量尚不多，即在銀行圈中亦不多見。惟大鈔發行之消息，已予金融及商品市塲以相當刺激。上午證劵市場內，永紗信和等八種華股爲之漲停板。白粳售價激昇兩成，衝出四千萬大關，門售最高價格至四千四百萬。其他雜糧價格亦狂漲。紗布麵粉等市塲，因奉市長面諭，上升幅度不得過百分之三，遂即停市。縱觀昨日市塲物價情勢，上午因混亂而激漲，午後因銀根緊俏而見回落；市塲息高至七角半，惟因大鈔之發行，本票貼水大情形已消滅。</p>
<p>日用品之零售價格，因市民之搶購而大漲，較之前日平均約高三成左右。肥皂上升最高，例如黃祥茂肥皂每塊由四十萬昇至六十萬，約漲百分之五十。其次爲紙烟，約漲百分之四十。迄晚因銀根抽緊，已有下落迹象。有資格人士推測國行於未來數日內，將大量拋售物資抽緊銀根，昨日紗管會已決定拋紗五千件，令紡建臨時掛牌配售，以收配合之效。昨日市塲上之高價，一半爲心理因素所造成，日內將見回落；惟商家之零售價格，有若干種已與受管制之市場價格脫離關係，恐仍將維持上昇之傾向。</p>
<h3>食米喊價狂升　白粳曾破四千萬大關</h3>
<p>米市因大票發行，人心浮動，貨主乘機喊高價格，早市白粳曾高達四千萬大關，高薄稻曾喊高至四于一百萬，約升五六百萬元·後市因聞業外各物上漲不多，市遂轉軟，收市回跌二百萬元，白粳後市三千八百萬，薄稻收市三千九百萬，軋漲約四百萬元。惟市塲報價因當局限令不得上漲百分之三，故僅見報升一百至一百五十萬，南北二市到貨祗一九五八石。</p>
<p>麵粉由當局嚴諭不準藉大票發行而抬價，致交易因此陷入停頓，中途由粉廠聯合以一一四八（連捐二萬）之價，供應各牌粉七五四〇包，每戶二十九包，其他交易未正式做開。塲外暗中喊價老車粉達一千三百五十萬，兵船一三〇〇萬，惟交易甚稀，後市亦疲。麩皮喊價八五〇萬，小麥進出雙方價未談妥，故無開出。</p>
<p>雜糧以大票發行已見事實，市上人心極堅，初市竟開不出。黃豆由貨主自行議定，乍豆一九〇〇萬，車豆二〇六〇萬，後即按此價開出，計升一五〇萬，苞米存少，扳升甚易，猛升二成。紅糧菉豆均挺四五百萬，蠶豆加二三百萬，元麥做開不多，芝蔴生仁各在客帮之吸取，及貨主之扳持下，漲五六百萬元。</p>
<p>食油因當局令不得過份波動，並限惟上漲百分之三爲度，因此交易難以展開，後大有油廠按限以七九〇〇萬供應本街豆油，但因不敷分配，乃告取銷，後改由各廠以八千萬之價供應豆油，僅有少數應市。中植油廠則以七千五百萬之價供應重慶凈生菜油。吉桶生油做一億〇五百萬，生菜油七千八百萬亦有交易，熟菜油等漲五六百萬元。豆餅初猛升，曾做九二〇萬，後疾退爲八六〇萬，軋漲五六十萬元。</p>
<h3>人絲初昂後平</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市初告上漲，繼卽回平，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤高喊念六億元，退至念五億元成交，旋因銀根有抽緊之象，人心虛軟，步步下降，午收即期價低至念三億三千萬元，隔日期喊念四億七千萬元，下午開盤念四億四千萬元，終因供過於求，收盤價跌至念三億元，結果與上週六價無上落。</p>
<p>廠經昨市始高後低，終比上週　六大一億元強。高零擔上午做開念五億元，即期款念四億元有成交，下午降至念三億五千萬元，旦有二天期頭。干經高零擔上午念億元有幾擔做開，下午行情亦告稍回。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市上落甚鉅，結果比週六微升，眞絲被面上午開市在十五億元左右，最大升至十六億元，且乏供應。旋因股市盤低，原料回小，人心告軟，最後降至十四億元，下午再低至十三億八千萬元。格子璧縐棧單，昨無成交，喊價在四百三十萬元左右。</p>
<h3>茶市漲勢殊緊</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，繼承上週高漲之餘威，故開後即以俏利姿態出現，瞬息間又在發行大鈔之過程中，各物均起彼動，而茶葉同業亦不甘示弱，喊價直上雲霄，是以趨勢進入風狂階段。惟臨收結果，局面稍轉和緩。良以銀根空前奇緊，拆借深感不易，一般貨主已相率吐出，乃呈無力再漲之象，然比前則軋升頗多云。</p>
<h3>金管派員嚴查　行荘鉅額票據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行發行大額關金劵消息公佈後，上海金管局爲防止投機份子擾亂金融市塲起見，昨晨特加派大批人員前往票據交換所，檢查大額票據之開發，即隨時嚴詰其戶名與用途，以防止從事投機活動，同時對行莊存放款之動態，亦予以密切注視。</p>
<h3>棉紗複製工業不滿拋紗新策</h3>
<p>花紗布管理委員會昨聯合紡建公司，在紗號業公會之市塲，拋售棉紗，以鎭定大鈔發行聲中之紗布市面。此次拋紗，係明定價格，預先公告數量，詢屬特色。而一方面在紡建公司內，仍照報價核配辦法配紗·紗管會主持人曾約棉紗複製工業負責人及棉號業負實人商談，請通力合作，以安市面。並稱報價核配，向爲復製業所不滿，茲特加改正云。惟複製業潘士浩當塲提出意見。（一）紗市塲須憑其入塲證入塲，而證位有限，廠家什八並未取得。（二）在塲配紗，仍以紡建配號爲憑。而紡建對於紗布之配售，因失於整理，並未辦到公平普及。此次囿於舊規，實爲不當。紗管會對此意見，表示重視，但云短期內尚無解決云，據潘氏透　，紗布配銷及管理辦法，應澈底改善，以期公平普及，實惠及民。在京曾與行政院翁院長交換意見。日前並應紗管會主任委負王嵐僧民之約，，對於具體計劃，有所商談云。</p>
<h3>大鈔激動買風　華股市氣奮發</h3>
<p>華股昨漲風雖熾烈，但難持久，上塲時有十一種漲達限度，永紗再以貼價做開，當局拋賣物資，銀根更緊，俏後小回，結局帶疲。</p>
<p>晨初以大額面關金券之激動，永紗新光華豐尋開高至漲停限度，開後永紗進行貼價交易，最高達五百元之多，惟一二六號一八七號等逢高有供，即起回風，惟是際八九號二一三號一五四號維持，屢迫漲停，但難持久。銀根更緊，一四五號二〇七號等賣到一一六〇〇元，四三號一三一號八九號一二九號尚納，升至一一八一〇元。紡建改變配紗方針，一日分數次懸牌，一六九號二三七號等賣到一一三〇〇元，二二〇號二二號趁低吸收，午收爲一一四〇〇元。較上週六除梅林聯地漲停，國貨新華恒豐漲一成，永公火柴統益華新均平，信誼景綸榮豐微挫，餘均微升迄半成不等。</p>
<p>後市永紗上塲一一七〇〇元，一二六號一六〇號等均出，雜牌奇軟，即退至屯一二〇〇元，雖由一六九號一六〇號一五四號等補進，而升至一一四三〇元，但人心仍極不定，國行交換雖無結果，仍被一三七號一八〇號所等迫低，盤旋之餘，收盤爲一一二五〇元。較晨收計梅林永業聯華仍停，景綸漲半成，統益小升，餘均微挫。塲外各未上市股票，以大生五洲及銀行文化股漲半成爲俏，餘尚穩健。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨雜牌轉秀，統丙則迫於銀根，獨見疲軟，成交二三百萬。統丙晨開一二六萬，自一二八萬退至一一〇萬，而後稍定。較上週六計甲乙升二萬元，丙跌三萬元，丁種漲四萬元，戊種好起六萬元。</p>
<h3>國行特設專櫃收回小額鈔票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自物價一再上漲，小額鈔票以交收不便，漸難流通，國行發行局鑒於事實需要，逐次將小額鈔票無限制換給大鈔，除在該局設櫃辦理外，並分飭各行處暨委託三行兩局一庫及各省地銀行轉飭各該行分支機構一體代兌。以全國計算，共有八百數十單位，截至上月底爲止，已收回小額鈔票三分之一以上，至銷燬工作，除由央行監事會稽核處及發行局派員監視外，並由各省市審計處派員會同辦理，以昭鄭重。又悉：收兌小鈔之標準，不久將自二千五百元提高至五千元。</p>
<h3>印棉一萬包下月初運滬</h3>
<p>紡織品外銷委員會主持之國產紗布易印棉事，現仍在加强推進中，印棉在今日已成爲本市紡織原料主要來源之一。據悉：印棉又將有一萬包自孟買及喀什齊兩地彙集運來，昨已自喀什齊啓椗，途經孟買加裝後，卽直駛來滬，預計下月初即可運到云。</p>
<h3>紗管會配合抽緊銀根　昨大量拋售棉紗　並規定臨時配銷棉紗辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會爲抑制棉紗市價，幷配合中央銀行抽緊銀根之政策起見，接受該行之委托，自昨起，開始大量拋售棉紗。幷爲適應大量拋售之需要，另行規定「臨時配銷棉紗辦法」八條，依照實施在臨時配銷棉紗期間，所有原在市塲舉辦之棉紗報價拋售暫行停辦，至中國紡織建設公司每週一三五日，對復製業配售棉紗，則仍照舊辦理。該會此項措施，昨已在兩市塲實施，成績頗佳。茲將辦法全文照錄如下。</p>
<p>又訊：紗管會爲配合政府拋售物資政策，原定拋售棉紗五千件，棉布五萬疋，預定收縮通貨十萬億。旋因各方納胃不佳，出售數量有限，共收縮通貨兩萬餘億，計准購者九十六戶，棉紗三百八十六件，收回金額五〇，〇〇四，〇〇〇萬元。又中紡昨循例售紗一〇四八件，合二十支紗一、五二七件又二分之一，共計收回通貨一四四七〇億。</p>
<h3>紗價先俏後挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因大額票發行關係，人心咸抱看高，多頭競搜，散空急起抵補，市氣鋒俏愈恒。嗣經當局宣佈，紗價上漲不能超越週六價百分之三，紗管會亦宣佈用戶需要各支粗細紗，可儘量向紡建公司申購無限制配售，並聞業外市塲頻受當局嚴密管制，更以大量物資將在市拋售，銀根頓緊，人心虛怯，買意轉淡，空方壓力頻施，市遂下挫。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳紗，初喊十九億，曾哄高至迫近二十億火關，旋以紡建拋住，卒以十八億二十萬站位，比週六軋升七千萬元。廿一支雙馬現紗仍以十三億五千萬收市，隔日出亦原盤不動，其餘　支粗細紗，大都呈漲多跌少之狀，成單計做開四十五件。</p>
<p>又訊：聞紗管會在塲懸牌，拋售二十支金城等二千二百零七件，價在十二億儿千萬至十三億三千萬之間，各方遂以買轉賣。</p>
<h3>嚴禁布商抬價</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因大鈔發行，人心混亂，但市上銀根依然緊迫。十二磅龍頭細布，塲內開五千四百萬，（塲外高至五百五十萬至六百萬稍有授受）</p>
<p>十時後，奉令嚴禁擅自抬價，漲率不得超越週末百分之三，並提早休市，並以紡建標售龍頭細布價爲四千六百五十萬，供源已有，人心驟轉虛疲，業中人相繼求售，卒以五千三百萬元結束，比週六上漲五百五十萬元。五福喇叭童亦升五百五十萬至六百萬元，其餘嗶嘰漂布，交易雖稱，行情亦跟好三四百萬至大七百萬元，色布士林布受染料頻漲，廠盤略予提高，市面再漲四五百萬至一千三五百萬爲最鉅。</p>
<h3>臨時配銷棉紗辦法</h3>
<p>紗管會昨規定臨時配銷棉紗辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）臨時配銷棉紗，採取掛牌定價定數出售方式，每次出售棉紗，先將支別牌別單價及數量公開牌示，聽由客戶請購，在每日棉紗市塲交易時間內，得酌察市塲供求情形，作一次兩次或兩次以上之掛牌出售，每次出售棉紗之數量及單價，均依市塲供求情形，予以增减需整。</p>
<p>（二）臨時配銷棉紗之對象，以原具有參加報價核售資格之複製工廠及紗商爲限。</p>

<p>（五）每次出售棉紗掛牌後，各客戶應就前條預爲辦妥手續之請購單，塡具請購棉紗之組別，及請購數量（應以中文大寫爲準，例如四十五件等是），在限定時間內，當塲自行投入預置市塲之該組棉紗標櫃內，逾時不得再投。每一客戶對於每次掛牌每一組棉紗之投單請購以一次爲限。</p>
<p>（六）每次掛牌所定每組棉紗出售總數，如多於該次投單請購數量，即一律照請購數量配售，如少於該次投單請購數量，則由配銷機關酌察情形，採取下列各項方式之一予以核配：</p>
<p>一·臨時增加該組棉紗出售總數，俾可全部照請購數量配售。</p>
<p>二·依照請購數量比例核减</p>
<p>三·將該組原定出售棉紗總數，平均分配各請購客戶，但以不超過各該客戶原請購數量爲限。</p>
<p>四·將各客戶請購數量之較大者，酌予核减，以不超過該組原定出售棉紗總數爲度</p>
<p>（七）臨時配銷棉紗之准購單，於當日下午三時半至五時半，向紡織建設公司領取，其應繳價款，應於次日上午十二時以前，備具本票，憑准購單繳送中央銀行。</p>

<h3>世界運動大會會場　溫布萊敝國體育場的長成</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕第十四屆奧林匹克世界運動會，本月廿九日至八月十四日，在倫敦舉行，將有六十二國的健兒，在溫布萊帝國體育塲大顯身手。英王喬治六世，也將御駕親臨，主特隆重的開幕儀式。</p>
<p>二十五週紀念</p>
<p>世運會今年在溫布萊舉行，也是慶祝此舉世聞名的體育運動中心帝國體育塲的二十五週年紀念。溫布萊於一九二三年完成，耗資七十五萬鎊，有廣大的室內運動塲，也有近代的戶內運動場。翌年，一九二四—二五年英帝國展覽會，即在此舉行，使節名流，冠蓋如雲，一時稱盛。</p>
<p>最早的跑狗場</p>
<p>大會閉冪後，體育場無人過問者凡二年，至一九二七年，經營者計劃革新，才建造了一道最早最完美的跑狗塲。一九二九年，又把汽車比賽介紹給英國觀衆。自茲以往，一帆風順，溫布萊便成了英國體育的中心，國際性和比較重要的足球賽，英國足球會的足球決賽</p>
<p>一九三四年，主持人愛爾文爵士更斥二十萬金鎊，雞造規模最完備之大體育館與游泳池，於是除足球與田徑外，游泳，水球，拳擊，摔角，冰上曲棍球，脚踏車賽，戶內田徑，草地網球，乒乓，溜冰等等各項運動的大賽，都在這裏上演。、</p>
<p>收容戰地難民</p>
<p>戰神曾使溫布萊沉寂過一時，大運動塲上僅跑狗和慈善足球賽還在舉行。但是下久，溫布萊換了一種方式，又在熱鬧起來，體育館暫作了難民遣送站和收容所，庇容來自法·比·直布羅陀等地的難民。之後，又改作了戰時工人宿舍和流動金屋材料的儲藏庫。</p>
<p>勝利後，溫布萊搖身一變，又恢復了戰前繁華，體育迷經過了幾年精神上的飢渴，都排山倒海湧來欣賞這裏的各項比賽，跑狗，汽車競賽，曲棍球，溜冰，拳擊，乒乓等等。</p>
<p>改建工作完成</p>
<p>溫布萊已完成改建工作，以應付行將到來的戰後首次世運大會。田徑塲上，除了第一流的七綫跑道外，並將建造一道特別的練習跑道。其他如飯店，休息室，更衣室，停車塲等等，都應有盡有。</p>
<p>聯絡大會各部門的大動脈—電話接綫機—將有三座，預備用最迅速最敏捷的方式，把大會消息，隨時交由各通訊社和英國廣播公司，傳達全球。大會的交通，則儘量利用無綫電指揮。</p>
<p>總之，溫布萊和英國正在竭其全力，使戰後首次世運大會，能够達到聯絡各國人民感情，並消除各民族間的隔閡的最高目標。（鑫）</p>

<h3>忘</h3>
<p>— 曙風</p>
<p>中國古書很少附有索引和目錄，覓取材料，全得依賴記憶，若一時記憶不起，必須翻箱倒　，搬動不少書籍。往往爲了一件故事，一個例證，便要整天價　在書堆裏這本翻翻，那本翻翻，有時偶然一找就找到，有時却找了半天依舊一無所得；有時分明記得在某本書裏曾經見到過，翻了好些時候，突然又會想起是在另一本書裏，及到找着，已經頭昏目眩了。所以過去每遇閒暇，總要找些可以分類的書來，忙上好些時候給編個目錄或索引，實在也是被這種無謂的苦悶給苦够了，才想起這種「未雨綱繆」的法子來。</p>
<p>紛處俗　，難免天天要勞苦自己腦筋，可惜誰也沒有過目不忘這種本事，也總免不了有幾處地方實在記不得那末許多，終于遺忘得乾乾凈凈。雖然「忘」字並未列入七情八情之中，但也人人俱有，可說是一種天賦的本能。我輩並非遯跡山林之士，優閒自若，對於紛擾世界可以一概不聞不問；也不能無視一切利害得失，把人間世看作贅疣，擺脫一切羈絆，作個無牽無掛的人。這一切，都因爲我們還不能忘情於這個世界上的種種事物。</p>
<p>據說靈魂輾轉投胎到塵寰，必須先要喝些「孟婆湯」，把前世一切瑣碎雜事，一概都忘的一淸二爽，才許轉世爲人。又譬如說一個人死後，家裏的人總要默祝死者「瞑目」，意思就是叫死者忘却世間一切坎坷，一切牽罣，安居泉下而已。這種說法固然跡近荒誕無稽，但其說明「忘」之與生俱來，到死方休，也倒不無一點道理。</p>
<p>但古之吳王夫差爲了矢志復父仇，「使之立于庭，苟出入，必謂之曰：夫差，爾忘越王殺爾父乎？則對曰：唯，不敢忘。三年，乃報越。一可惜夫差仍太健忘，一等到復了仇，便就躊躇滿志，罔顧逆耳忠言，却忘了勾踐正在臥薪嘗胆，返待雪恥。結果吳王終至身敗名裂，亡國了事。然則健忘之危險，却也不可不加以留意。</p>
<p>睚眦必報固然不可，不念舊惡固然應當，祗是這種大度能容的氣量也該有個限度。至少要時時自己警覺，不要吃過了蛞馬上便忘的無影無蹤，弄得養虎縱虎，貽患無窮才是。</p>
<h3>崩巖</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>近月恒苦疾風暴爾，最近颱風進襲，尤感成脅。憶當抗戰時期，初避地川東萬縣，爲避敵機空襲，僦居山中僧寺，寺處層巒峭壁，由山麓至寺，須經峻險之石梯七百餘級，寺後有石巖，深可容百餘人，一遇空襲，即可避入，山居淸寂，不聞市慕，遠眺大江，俯瞰全境，以爲是世外桃源矣。不料春夏之交，大雨時降，疾風亦烈，電光如火，射窗而入，光中嘗見火星四濺，繼以巨雷，似在咫尺，震耳欲聾，有時雷聲往來，隆隆不絕，嘗臨屋上，嗣復突然爆發，其聲之烈，屋瓦時爲震落。大自然之威力，旣極恐怖，然其尤可怖者，則爲山洪暴發。左右前後，諸山瀑布，一齊下瀉，瀑中滿挾泥砂石塊，如萬馬奔騰，加以疾風急雨，其聲益厲。是時突起巨聲，如天崩地塌，四山皆震，寺僧聞此聲，必自語日，又不知何巖崩潰矣。　萬縣全境皆山，山皆石質，高峻而險，依山或在山腰建屋，必選山石完整之處，及其上不爲山泉所經過者，方可以居，否則大雨之時，石爲山洪冲激，悅從山頂墜落，其下之屋全成　粉。若上有山泉，則一雨即成瀑布，直奔屋頂，而全屋亦成魚龜。土人雖知地利，能相嚴石以居，然日久雨侵風蝕，山石暗壞，飛來之禍，仍不能免。予所居寺左，有巨廟一，竟被石壓毀兩次，一則石大如方桌，將　之大殿前半壓毀，幸在日間，寓客大半外出，僅少數爲墮瓦所傷，一則墮石較小，將廚房盡毀，幸在深夜，廚中無人。有鄂商築室於另一嚴下，以不知地利雨時，全巖崩墮，闔家悉斃其下。友人某君依嚴以居，大雨滂沱，忽聞屋後震響，且有碎石擊牆，念出觀察，則見山石迎續下墮，中有數巨石蠢蠢而動，沿山滾下，即大呼家人出奔，闔家剛出，巨石已闖然破牆而入。有農人建茅屋於予寺之下，一夕大雨，聞有巨聲，次晨下山，則山半石梯，已爲巨石壓毀。石大如屋，當路難行，而農人茅屋無恙，以越其屋頂而過也，亦云險矣。予等屢感驚險，僉謂山居墮石，甚於敵人之投彈，因敵機空襲，尙有警報，可以預避，此則突然而下，欲避不遑，故萬縣　人，恒有石壓之語，如吾輩下江人之　人雷擊者。可見崩巖之禍，萬人久驚心動魄也。</p>
<h3>海紅樓詩録</h3>

<p>長憶胎胎舞白翹，開械落羽掃炎歡，九皋　望千年蔚，萬古雲霄一　　。腰有霜翎添嘯詠，幾多灰髮伴淸寥，知君尙有乘軒樂，淞海黄塵析　饒。</p>

<h3>橫波夫人火齊印</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>常熟師米齋沈氏，富收藏，書畫骨董，抄校善本，兼收並蓄。主人沈君抱一曾出示顧横波火齊印，大若小兒拳，朮有數兩，顏色鮮紅若玫瑰，寳光四射。藏以楠木盒，盒上刋有一跋曰：「鄭　藏此印廿年，余僅獲打本一紙。後與道州何氏易其先人手澤，以無緣一見爲恨。今西蠡來都，出此相觀，借玩數日，因　寳物所聚不常，於數年中已三易主矣。漫爲之記。壬辰春井眉。」井眉者，翁松禪別字也。緣知是印曾藏蘇州潘伯寅家，道州何氏則何紹基後裔也。西蠡乃費念慈太史。沈氏得自趙古泥手。抱一手拓一紙見贈，因請楊無恙丈題詩四首，其第三首云：「灃蘭沅芷擅風流，方寸瓊瑰刧燼收。硯攝緣洮成二妙，（沈石友藏阿翠硏，有馬湘蘭題詩。）紅牙心印綘雲樓。（元和顧氏藏綘雲樓牙印，腴潤如紅玉，同爲人間　寳）」橫波名媚，又名眉，字眉生，龔鼎孳姬人，能寫墨蘭。鼎孳旣降淸，其夫人義不受胡淸誥命，讓諸橫波。橫波後又更姓徐，因號徐夫人。出身亦自勾欄，堪與柳如是夫人齊名。明末名妓輩出，每倚一名公以自重，名公亦藉名妓以示其風流，實則適見其不以國事爲念，溺於聲色而已！今之名妓，曁所謂交際花者，又曷　少哉？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>前談北大校友一文，旋見本版登署名「介夫」作「北大舊事」，以爲同學同聲之應，而未悉何人。後有寗波徐君行白偕妻李楚琴女士持函來見，乃知爲工科同班李兄（印文驥現在錢塘江橋工程處供職），楚琴即其令媛，徐君即其令坦。夫婦皆服務聯勤劇隊，駐在北平，樸素安詳，可稱靑年優秀。介夫爲粵籍同學之一，函中叙及區述齊（國著），即拙記校友所云工科之班長，勤幹忠實，人極有趣，以Potata之綽號　炙衆口者，畢業後一向服務工程界，事變前因胃病在南京中山陵園休養，抗戰軍興，走皖肥一帶，遇匪受傷，間關逃滬，歷盡艱辛恐怖，形神俱瘁，竟以不起，可勝痛惜。陳志　昔創辦廣東國民大學，盧頌芳·李伯賢充任敎授，皆當年北大之粵籍同學也。猶憶昔年觀劇至「紅雙禧」一齣，老丐金松謂莫稽幸只「秀才」，到其家喝豆汁，若是「大學堂的老爺們」，又當以何物供之。按舊詞是秀才來喝豆汁，若舉人又當如何。淸末科舉已廢，丑角相機改詞，乃以大學堂的學生代之，雖是滑稽科　，然亦足見母校之聲光獨步一時。因學校旣代科舉而興，而「大學堂」又爲彼時全城惟一之大學，故無須冠字區別，只提大學，即人人共知爲吾校，恍如梨園界一提「大老板」即共知爲程長庚，不須加姓也。又觀「運陞店」一劇，王鳴芳（投店覓住所之士子）問上房。店主人答上房（即特等正房）是廣東老爺們住的，蓋舊京人知粵東向以富庶著名，京官宦粵者如瑞麟等皆滿載而歸，而各省同鄉在京所建之會館，又以粵省及各邑館建築宏敞堅實，比較他省壯觀者多，故丑脚偕作諢語，亦復透露人情風土之一班，皆耐人回憶。</p>
<h3>泰耶魯人</h3>
<p>— 東方旣白</p>
<p>在台灣的台北·新竹·花述。台中各地，有山地同胞泰耶魯族散居。因其生活方式特異，一班人皆視同化外，其實，移住平地的泰耶魯人也有不少知識份子，一口流利的日本話，一筆順暢的日本文，有的已當了學校的老師。</p>
<p>據統計，台灣泰耶魯人有四七五〇三人，僅次於台灣阿米族。他們的眼鼻，面孔，膚色以及語言等。酷似南洋人，尤其是語言，和南洋馬來土語極相近。據說日本發動太平洋戰爭時，抽調合灣山地泰耶魯人到南洋作戰，竟能和當地的馬來人通話，準此而論，泰耶魯人本屬於南洋馬來系統，是十分可信的了。</p>
<p>他們主要糧食是地瓜和小米，吃飯時大多沒有盌筷。男子以打獵爲娛樂，等於我們看戯看電影一樣。在將出發時，如在中途見有飛鳥向他們同一方向飛去，他們認爲吉利；如鳥飛方向與人去方向成十字形，則凶。他們獵獲了一隻野獸（如鹿，野猪等），頭和肝必獻給酋長，一隻前腿贈給發現者，另一隻前腿及內臟贈給開槍者，當地的警察及公敎人員各分得一隻後腿，其餘部份則人人有分，全村均而食之，不問曾否參加打獵，一視同仁。這種均分物品的作風，是泰耶魯人的特點之一。如果你帶了一盒洋火贈給他們，你應一枝一枝分給周圍所有的一切人，他們認爲如此才算公平。又如開墾水田，也是大家出工，通力合作，開墾之後，也歸大家共同享用。利益均沾，守望相助，沒有大地主，沒有大富豪，更沒有盜賊與乞丐。</p>
<p>他們沒有貨幣，普通是以物易物的，根本不知道鈔票的用途是什麽。他們沒有數字觀念，從一到十·百·千·至萬而止，萬以上便無法解釋了。</p>
<p>他們款客非常熱誠，飮酒時兩人共川一個杯子，同時舉杯喝酒，臉貼着臉，表示親密。當你踏入番社時，便可看目大庭廣衆之間許多靑年男女擁　接吻，或男女同吹一個口琴。他們的社交極端自由，但却十分看重男女的貞操問題，未婚男女若發生姦淫行爲，都處以極刑。</p>
<p>十餘年前、泰耶魯族的男女在弱冠時，便在面孔上刺些花紋—鯨面—以爲美觀。現在，他們審美眼光轉移了，這種習俗已不復存在。</p>
<p>泰耶魯族的同胞，勤苦樸實，廉潔勇敢，不卑汚，不欺詐，重名譽而知恥，優點甚多；只是和平地上的人比起來，生活似乎過於簡單了。（寫於台北）</p>
<h3>老人村</h3>
<p>— 浣人</p>
<p>一個人到了老年，擺在他的面前的就只有這兩條路：不是坐以待斃，那就得强打起精神去工作，以便在工作中獲取快樂和健康。英國肯德地方有一個老人名叫左斯亞，阿爾非爾特，他是一個醫生，一個律師，又是一個哲學家，曾經說過這樣的一句名言：「社會的組識是如比，只有工作才是健康和快樂的途徑。任何人希望健康和快樂，只有工作。」所以，當他看到大多的老人所走的只是這一條憂鬱和衰弱的坐以待斃的　時，他就立地召集了一批老人，在一個非常荒凉的多登呑地方組織成一個村落，使這此老人再從事靑年人所能做的工作。這批老人，當年也是有工作的人，因爲年紀大了，就被工廠或其他的事業機構擯班在外。但是他們到了村裏之後，他們的工作能力立刻就顯示了出來，他們能造竹木器具，能砌牆舖地，能做園藝和農塲上等的工作，他們住自己所造的屋，吃自己耕種的食物，但他們却沒有工資，因爲他們工作是爲了健康和快樂。在工作完了時，他就就羣坐在戶外吸煙哪天歌唱玩要，愛怎麽就怎麽。他們的生活，眞是大天在快樂和健康中度過去的。阿爾非爾特並且還給他們一些零用錢，又替他們在銀行裏儲存了一些款子，準備在他們離去這老人村時贈送給他們。他們來去自由，不受任何拘束。目前，這個荒凉冷落的多登在地方已成了一個繁榮歡樂的老人村了。</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>美國政府機關消耗的紙張極多，因此政府已自設造紙廠供給此項紙張。單是調査珍珠港事件責任時，各種紀錄和報告耗紙即遠二十五噸以上。</p>
<p>第二次大戰中，美軍將官死傷及被俘者共計一百名正。</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Holds a Secret Meeting Today to Discuss Amending Existing Tax Rates; General Budget Bill Completes Review Process</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold the third secret meeting of its first session on the 20th. In the morning, discussions will focus on amending existing tax rates, increasing financial revenue, and other important cases. In the afternoon, a resolution on the national general budget bill will be made to complete the legislative procedures. The Yuan's Procedure Committee convened on the 19th and has already scheduled the agenda for the secret meeting, which was immediately sent to press overnight. The budget committee conveners and staff are also working diligently to compile the comprehensive review report, which was passed by the joint meeting of all Yuan committees and sent to the Secretariat at 8 PM on the 19th for submission to the Yuan meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The Legislative Yuan continued to hold joint meetings of various committees throughout the day on the 19th. Over two hundred committee members attended, completing the final review of the national general budget bill and its implementing regulations at high speed. The morning sessions were chaired by Wang Puhan and Li Boshen. In addition to revising and passing the budgets under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance according to the comprehensive review opinions, the budgets under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education were not decided in the morning and were continued in the afternoon. The afternoon session was chaired by Yin Shuxian. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian, Vice Minister of Agriculture Xie Chengping, and Vice Minister of Food Tian Yushi attended the meeting. First, the budgets under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education were passed according to the group review opinions. Then, the departments of Judicial Administration, Agriculture and Forestry, Industry and Commerce, Transportation, Social Affairs, Water Conservancy, Land Administration, Health, Food, Accounting, and Auditing, as well as the Resource, Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs, and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committees, along with debt expenditure, retirement and compensation expenditure for civil servants, provincial and municipal subsidy fees, the second reserve fund, and the construction fees for central government employee dormitories were discussed. Except for the part under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, which was temporarily retained for review after the business plans and revenue budgets of its affiliated state-owned enterprises are received, the rest were passed according to the comprehensive review opinions without major revisions. As for the abolition of the Fuel Management Committee, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the opinions differed during the comprehensive review. After lengthy discussions, a vote was taken, and the majority passed the abolition of all of them, with only the Industrial Experiment Institute being retained. The China Grain Company under the Food Department was also abolished. Subsequently, the discussion of the implementing regulations of the general budget bill continued until 7:30 PM, when the full text was revised and passed. The efficiency of the proceedings was unprecedented in this session of the Legislative Yuan. At this point, the review process of the general budget bill, which has attracted national attention, was completely finished.</p>
<h3>Draft Property Tax Regulations Completed Review by the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committee; Only a Few Amendments Made Due to Time Constraints</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committee completed the review of the "Provisional Property Tax Regulations Draft" in the afternoon of the 19th. Chapters Six (Tax Collection Procedure), Seven (Penalties), and Eight (Supplementary Provisions) were discussed in succession. However, due to time constraints, only a few key points were decided to be amended. The work of sorting out the text was entrusted to Jian Guansan, Cui Jingbo, Zhang Jingyu, Liu Quanzhong, and Jin Shaoxian to complete as quickly as possible. The main points of the amendments are: (1) Retain the nomination method of the supervisory body; (2) Taxpayers should provisionally pay the tax amount to the collecting agency within one month after declaring their property, and the agency will issue a tax payment certificate; (3) "Informing" is changed to "reporting," and the bonus for the reporter is reduced to 10% of the taxpayer's tax amount (the original draft was 30%); (4) Those who make false "reports" should be punished, and the penalties should be decided by the Yuan meeting.</p>
<h3>Organizational Regulations Draft for Supervisory Yuan Committees and Administrative Offices; Revised and Passed by the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The two draft regulations, the Organizational Regulations of the Committees of the Supervisory Yuan and the Organizational Regulations of the Administrative Offices of the Supervisory Yuan Members, have been revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee on the 19th. The meeting was chaired by Yang Youjiong. The main points of the revision: Regarding the organization of the committees of the Supervisory Yuan, they were merged into ten committees, including "Internal Affairs and Land Administration," "Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs," and "National Defense." Regarding the establishment of the administrative offices of the Supervisory Yuan members, the committee members had heated discussions. The result was to still divide the country into sixteen regions, as was the case with the inspectorates of the Supervisory Yuan during the period of political tutelage. The principle is that the Supervisory Committee members who preside over the administrative offices should avoid their own constituencies. In addition, the meeting also passed a proposal to sort out current laws and regulations and to streamline and simplify the principles of legislation. As for the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan's request to formulate "Standards and Interview Rules for Maintaining the Confidentiality of the Contents of Secret Meetings of This Yuan," it was also raised at the meeting, but there was not enough time to discuss it.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Prepare to Establish an Economic Control Bureau in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Jiang Jingguo to Serve as the Director</p>

<h3>Final Accounts to Be Handled in Two Phases; Measures for Closing the First Half of This Year's National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure; Ministry of Finance Invites Relevant Agencies to Discuss and Implement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The Ministry of Finance has recently stated that since the central general budget for this year is prepared in two phases, the final accounts should also be handled in two phases. However, at the end of the first half of the year, the revenue agencies failed to deposit all the taxes collected into the treasury before the end of June, and the supplementary budget bill and the emergency order for the allocation of funds could not be signed and allocated before the end of June due to the timing of approval. Moreover, during the period of suppression of the rebellion, traffic in various places was sometimes blocked, and the branches of the treasury in the rebel areas were moved around, resulting in the monthly statements of the national treasury not being delivered on time. All receivables and payables cannot be closed at the end of the first half of the year. Therefore, a draft of the measures for closing the national treasury revenue and expenditure for the first half of the 37th year was drawn up, and relevant agencies such as the Auditing Department, the Accounting Department, the Central Bank, and the National Treasury Bureau were convened to discuss and decide on its implementation. The main points of the content are as follows: (1) For all budgets or expenditure bills and emergency orders for the first half of the year, if the funds have not been fully allocated by the end of the first half of the year, the Ministry of Finance may issue payment orders before July 20, and all levels of the national treasury shall prepare and issue them before August 5, which will still be counted as the expenditure for the first half of the year. If the funds have not been allocated after the deadline mentioned above, and the agencies still need to use them, they should go through the procedures for transferring the year. (2) The total deposit of the national treasury revenue for the first half of the year, the deposit for the ordinary expenses of various agencies, may continue to be used before August 10. The remaining amount that has not been used after the deadline and belongs to the first half of the year should be returned by the using agencies according to law and included in the total deposit of revenue for the lower year. The remaining amount belonging to the advance allocation of expenses for the second half of the year will continue to be used in the second half of the year. (3) The remaining amount of various expenditures managed by the agencies themselves should be submitted to the nearest national treasury before August 10 and included in the total deposit of revenue for the second half of the year, and reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification. (4) The public treasury checks issued by various agencies for the deposit of ordinary expenses for the first half of the year, which are remitted from place A to place B and are still used in the national treasury, may continue to be used before August 10. The remaining amount that has not been used after the deadline shall be handled in accordance with Article 2. (5) The special fund deposits that have not been used by August 10 will be added to the use in the second half of the year. (6) For all funds allocated by emergency orders, if the bill has not been prepared by the end of the first half of the year, the competent authorities should prepare a summary estimate before July 20 and submit it for approval, with the end of July as the final approval deadline, and the national treasury should enter the accounts separately before August 10. (7) The accounting reports of the total deposit of revenue of each branch treasury (all payments and receipts before August 10 of the 37th year) should be sent to the district branch treasury before August 15, and the district branch treasury should complete the work before the end of August.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Deterioration of the Berlin Crisis</h3>
<p>The Berlin crisis, although it once tended to ease when the Soviet Union partially lifted the ban on East-West traffic in Germany during the Tito's rebellion in Eastern Europe, it has been deteriorating ever since, and there is a tendency to turn sharply downward. Even British Defense Minister Shinwell said: "The situation in Berlin is really explosive. Fortunately, no one is willing to fire the first shot at present." From these few words alone, one can see the deterioration of the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent series of shocking events: The first is the arrival of sixty American Superfortress bombers in England. The American air force personnel who arrived in the United Kingdom with the Superfortress have reached as many as 1,500, and will use the air force bases of Britain and France; no matter how the United States explains it, it is still a demonstrative action against the Soviet Union. The second is that the foreign ministers' meeting of the five Western European Union countries opened in The Hague yesterday, and the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will also send aircraft to participate in the Berlin airlift to show the unity of action of the Western European group of countries. The third is the new American plan to open the blockade of Berlin by force, and to implement economic sanctions against the Soviet Union if necessary. Once Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have expressed their approval of this plan, a new note will be submitted to Moscow, once again demanding that the Soviet Union immediately lift the blockade of Berlin, otherwise the Western allies will take action in accordance with the planned plan. On the Soviet side, they are also taking threatening measures against the Berlin airlift, and will occasionally conduct exercises with transport planes and fighter planes over Berlin, and will close two of the three air corridors in Berlin, so that the Western allies can no longer use air transport to supply Berlin. Looking at the general trend, the Soviet Union is determined to go its own way to the end, and the Western allies are unwilling to compromise. The Berlin crisis has indeed reached the stage where both sides are showing their cards.</p>
<p>Since the West German agreement was signed in London, the Western European allies immediately implemented currency reform in West Germany, forcing the Soviet Union to take strong action in Germany, and adopted a "cold encirclement" strategy against Berlin, cutting off the water and electricity supply and railway traffic in the British, American, and French zones, causing a serious crisis in Berlin, in an attempt to drive the forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France out of Berlin, in order to offset the impact caused by the West German agreement. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement" of Berlin immediately caused a serious reaction from the Western allies. The US State Department openly accused the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement" of Berlin as a "unilateral act of challenge." General Clay, the commander of the US Army in Germany, also said in a firm tone: "The Soviet Union is now implementing its final pressure in an attempt to drive us out of Berlin; but in any case, unless resort is made to war, any action taken by the Soviet Union will not succeed." Judging from General Clay's words alone, it can be seen that it is simply impossible for the Western allies to make concessions to the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the deterioration of the Berlin crisis is enough to constitute a serious threat to European peace; therefore, after the Soviet Union implemented a "cold encirclement" of Berlin, the British and American authorities had long demanded that their respective governments deal with the Soviet Union strongly. The governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France also attached great importance to the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement," and in May, they wanted to take joint action against Moscow, demanding that the Soviet Union immediately and unconditionally lift its "cold encirclement" of Berlin, and wanted to warn the Soviet Union that if it insisted on its current strategy in Berlin, it would inevitably cause serious consequences. But just as the three governments were about to lodge a protest with Moscow, the European Communist International Information Bureau suddenly resolved to expel Yugoslav Marshal Tito from the party, which not only cracked the "iron curtain" in Eastern Europe, but also caused a deterioration in the relations between South and the Soviet Union; therefore, the Soviet Union's sight was shifted from Berlin to Belgrade, and it partially lifted the ban on East-West traffic in Germany, easing the Berlin crisis. However, it was not long before the relations between South and the Soviet Union gradually became clear, and the Soviet Union's actions in Berlin not only "returned to its old ways," restoring the "cold encirclement" of Berlin, but also intensified, and even wanted to prevent the Western allies from airlifting Berlin. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France were forced to lodge a protest with Moscow on July 8.</p>
<p>The main points of the protest by the three powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, when combined, include the following: (1) Pointing out that the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin has created a serious international situation; (2) Suggesting that the four powers conduct negotiations to discuss the conditions for lifting this blockade, but the four powers must reopen negotiations after the Soviet Union first lifts its blockade of Berlin; (3) Declaring that any occupying country that wants to implement a blockade against the residents of Berlin is unacceptable; (4) Revealing the contents of the secret agreement between the three giants of Du (Truman), Shi (Stalin), and Qiu (Churchill) on June 14, 1945. Stalin had given a firm guarantee that the US military had the right to enter Berlin via railways, highways, and air. Today's Soviet blockade is a breach of promise. A week later, the Soviet Union submitted a reply, refusing to lift the blockade of Berlin, and attributed the responsibility for creating the current situation to the Western countries. The opinions of both sides are completely different and there is no hope of compromise, forcing the Western allies to consider the "next step."</p>
<p>This "next step," after careful consideration by the three powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, if they want to break the blockade of Berlin, they must take the following steps: (1) Submit the Berlin blockade incident to the Hague International Court of Justice for handling, in order to establish the legitimacy of the three Western powers' presence in Berlin and the right of supply convoys to pass through the Soviet-occupied zone to Berlin. If both sides have the spirit of abiding by international law and treaties and have the sincerity to resolve the issue peacefully, then this step is the most ideal; but in the era of strong power that despises the law, the establishment of legitimacy and its rights by the International Court of Justice is actually meaningless. (2) The United Nations Security Council should handle this incident in accordance with the provisions for investigating threats to international peace. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has long been considering "asking the Security Council to discuss the Berlin crisis," but it has not yet materialized, because this move is of no help in lifting the Berlin blockade. This is because the Soviet Union has the power of veto in the Security Council and can exercise its veto power over any decision. (3) Take strong retaliatory measures against the Soviet Union, break the blockade of Berlin by force, and if necessary, take military force to test the Soviet Union's blockade strength, or implement economic sanctions to force the Soviet Union to submit. However, this kind of behavior is inevitably too dangerous and may cause unexpected consequences.</p>
<p>In summary, the Western allies have almost no way to deal with the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement." Peaceful methods are difficult to work, and strong measures are too dangerous. Where to go and what to do is really worthy of serious consideration by the Western allies. However, what is called the Western allies will inevitably follow the lead of the United States, and the United States' opinion is enough to influence everything. The US government has decided to convene a special meeting of Congress, and Republican members have also asked to discuss US-Soviet relations. As for how to save the new crisis in Berlin, we should seek a way out of desperation. People all over the world who are holding their breath and waiting for the situation in Berlin to turn from danger to safety are all hoping that the US Congress can take decisive and firm measures.</p>

<h3>Lao Jun Miao Oilfield in Gansu Province: Monthly Production of Over 700,000 Gallons of Oil; New Facilities Being Prepared for Implementation</h3>
<p>[By Airmail from Lao Jun Miao on the 15th] The Lao Jun Miao Oilfield of the China Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Gansu-Qinghai Branch was originally reorganized from the Gansu Oilfield. The mine was established during the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the lack of equipment, everything was done as best as possible with old and scrap materials. The wells that were drilled were also overproduced due to the urgent need for oil during the war and are on the verge of depletion.</p>
<p>Since the victory, military transportation in the Northwest has still been in demand for oil. CPC's assistant manager Deng Kequan was sent to preside over the mine, Deng actively sought improvements, added new refineries to improve the quality of finished products, drilled new wells to supplement the supply of crude oil, and extensively explored oil fields to lay the foundation for the petroleum industry. However, in the past two years, transportation has been inconvenient, materials have been difficult to transport, prices have been rising daily, and funds have often been tight. Fortunately, the person in charge has been farsighted, and the employees at all levels have worked together with one heart. In a very short period of two years, they were able to complete two cracking distillation oil refineries, add more than 2,000 meters of new wells, expand the mining area by more than four times, and discover several new oil wells in Gansu and Qinghai provinces.</p>
<p>Since October of last year, the monthly output of the mine has maintained a record high. Last month, the production of more than 700,000 gallons was even more astonishing. President Weng sent a telegram of congratulations. The oilfield of the mine covers an area of 3,000 acres and has drilled 39 wells, of which 15 are currently producing oil. Ten new wells are planned to be drilled this year, and there is confidence that oil will be produced before October.</p>
<p>The mining area covers an area of approximately 70 square kilometers, with more than 6,000 rooms of various types of houses. The employees and their families total approximately 9,000 people. The current monthly expenditure is approximately 94.3 billion, most of which is used for expanding the business and purchasing and transporting foreign equipment, which is not included. The salaries of the employees are less than 100 billion. In addition to the production and management departments, the mining area also has a hospital, bathhouse, theater, newspaper, primary and secondary schools, industrial training classes, and daily necessities manufacturing departments such as ceramics, bricks, tiles, civil engineering, and flour. Clothing, food, housing, transportation, culture, and entertainment are all equipped, so although the employees are in the deserted Gobi, they can still work with peace of mind, and most of them are willing to dedicate themselves to the petroleum industry. In addition to the "Public" and "Sincerity" mottos of the National Resources Commission, the mine also adds "Striving," and the loyalty, diligence, and conscientiousness of the employees of each department are very touching.</p>
<h3>Promotion of Zhejiang Agriculture to Temporarily Use 25 Counties as Demonstration Areas; Three Parties Jointly Form Committee; Chen Yi Concurrently Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 19th] After Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Group came to Hangzhou, they agreed with the Zhejiang Provincial Government on the evening of the 18th to jointly form the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee. It was decided to set up a committee of seven members, with Zhejiang Chairman Chen Yi concurrently serving as chairman, Construction Department Director Gong Peicheng concurrently serving as general manager, and Jinling University College of Agriculture Dean Zhang Zhiwen concurrently serving as technology director. Twenty-five counties will be temporarily used as demonstration areas, and it has been decided to choose them from the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou-Ningbo-Shaoxing-Jinhua and other areas. The three parties have signed the agreement, and the funds can be remitted soon. Zuo and others will transfer to Shanghai and return to Nanjing on the 19th.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty currently facing the mine is still the difficulty in restoring transportation, the inability to transport a large number of materials, and the inability to maintain an equilibrium between oil prices and costs. The new measures for the mine in the future are to establish lubricating oil plants, asphalt plants, justice gas plants, cement plants, 20,000 KW power plants, and steelmaking departments. It is estimated that all the product equipment that the petroleum industry itself should have will be completed by the end of next year. In short, the authorities are confident in the reserves of the mine, and its scale is one of the best in the country today, and its future is infinitely bright.</p>
<h3>New Xiang County Magistrate Li Kuiguang Accused of Colluding with Bandits by the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Report from our Xinxiang, 18th] The local assembly recently accused Li Kuiguang, the magistrate of Xinxiang County, to the Twelfth Pacification Zone Headquarters, of colluding with bandits and providing them with supplies. According to the assembly's statement, on the 27th of last month, the magistrate secretly dispatched Shi Xiupu, deputy leader of the Hetuo Town Security Detachment, to hire laborers to transport thirteen boxes of "79" bullets out of the area. At the blockade checkpoint, he presented an official certificate sealed with the county's official seal, falsely claiming that they were to resupply the Hetuo Town training team. The checkpoint guards allowed them to pass. At 6 PM that afternoon, they arrived at Hetuo Town and hid the bullets in civilian homes, planning to transport them across the Wei River to the bandit area during the quiet of the night. However, this was detected by Yuan Chuanbiao, captain of the Sixth Company of the Second Training Team of the county government stationed in Hetuo Town, who devised an ambush. At 11 PM, the criminals carried the bullets across the river, advancing towards the bandit area, and were intercepted. Shi Xiupu and one soldier were arrested on the spot and handed over to the county government for investigation. However, after receiving the case, Magistrate Li secretly concealed it.

<h3>Handling Fishing Boat Supplies: Management Committee Approves Measures; Distribution Conference to Be Held in Shanghai at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Local News] The Management Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee recently held its fifth general meeting in Nanjing. A spokesperson for the committee told reporters yesterday that the main resolution passed at the fifth general meeting was the handling of fishing boat supplies. The committee currently has over 20,000 tons of shipbuilding timber, which had previously been decided to be sold. However, technical problems have arisen, delaying the sale. It is now proposed that the Ministry of Transportation purchase the timber, which has been approved by the fifth general meeting. The proceeds will then be distributed to coastal provinces and municipalities based on the proportion of wartime damage and the state of fisheries to build new fishing boats. The fifth general meeting also resolved that the distribution plan and technical issues for fishing attachments such as fishing nets, ropes, and diesel engines will be discussed at a meeting on the distribution of materials for building fishing boats to be held in Shanghai on the 28th. Preparations are currently underway. Participants will include representatives from the coastal provinces and municipalities, as well as representatives from fishery organizations. As for the northeastern provinces, which have long coastlines and developed fisheries before the war, fishery materials should also be distributed. However, due to the difficult situation in the area, the fifth general meeting decided to reserve 20% of all fishery materials (including the proceeds from the sale of materials). However, if the situation in the area does not stabilize by the end of this year, the materials will be reallocated for other uses. The spokesperson also explained to reporters that the committee plans to invite the US Economic Cooperation Administration to invest in cooperation to make good use of the committee's transportation, industrial, and mining equipment and materials.

<h3>Western European Five-Nation Foreign Ministers Secretly Consult on Countermeasures to the Berlin Crisis: Bidault Advocates Restoring Four-Power Talks; North Atlantic Joint Defense System Also Studied Carefully</h3>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 19th] French Foreign Minister Bidault, in opening the Brussels Treaty conference on the 19th, called on other European countries to join the European Union. He deeply hoped that the Western European alliance would be expanded into a pan-European alliance. In the midst of the Berlin crisis, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg held their first meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here to review the progress of the alliance. The meeting is expected to quickly resolve the report on the implementation of military joint defense, and then solemnly discuss Germany and the strategy to deal with the Soviet Union's threat to force the Western allies to withdraw from Berlin. Bidault is expected to urge the resumption of four-power talks, first restoring the Allied Control Council, and finally reopening the Foreign Ministers' Conference. After Bidault's speech, reporters were asked to leave the meeting, and the secret meeting continued. The meeting in the afternoon of the 19th was extremely secret, discussing the Berlin crisis. Dean, a German expert from the British Foreign Office, flew here from London this morning to attend the afternoon meeting. Some officials hinted that the final result might be to convene a Foreign Ministers' Conference specifically to discuss Germany, but no one was willing to state this and weaken the power of negotiations with the Soviet Union. The morning meeting decided to establish a special economic and financial committee to meet in the afternoon to find practical solutions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 19th] The foreign ministers of the five Western European Union countries began a two-day secret meeting at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 19th. The Berlin crisis and the North Atlantic Joint Defense Plan provisionally drafted at the seven-nation talks in Washington are the main topics of discussion. The foreign ministers of the five participating countries are British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Foreign Minister Bidault, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Boetzelaer, and Luxembourg Foreign Minister Bech, who are participating in the meeting as members of the Western European Union Consultative Committee. Dutch Foreign Minister Boetzelaer, in his capacity as host, gave a welcome speech, stating that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg would always be grateful to Foreign Secretary Bevin for making the Western European Union a reality. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also welcome this opportunity to fully participate in the actions taken by Britain and the United States regarding the Berlin crisis. When talking about the military joint defense agreement of the Western European Union, Boetzelaer said that if this treaty is necessary to defend Western Europe, there should be no further hesitation and it should be made a reality as soon as possible. Bevin then rose to deliver a response, hoping that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg would fully cooperate with Britain on the German issue, and believed that the United States would also welcome this cooperation. Bevin emphasized that the primary task of Western European countries is to maintain their own freedom, but at the same time they should not forget Germany's responsibility as a Western country, and should never allow violent forces to run rampant there. He continued, "It has only been six months since I first raised the issue of the Western European Union in the House of Commons, and now such progress has been made, which is gratifying. We are all trying to build this great alliance, and we must share the glory of this work." After the opening ceremony was completed, the foreign ministers of the five countries began to solemnly study the North Atlantic regional defense system drafted by the representatives of the seven countries of the United States, Canada, Britain, America, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in Washington, and the report of the Western Happy Alliance Permanent Military Committee. They took a break for lunch, and continued to discuss the general international situation from the standpoint of the Western European Union policy in the afternoon. Bevin will also hold separate talks with Bidault to exchange views on the Berlin crisis. When the British Embassy hosted a banquet for Bevin last night, the Canadian Ambassador to the Netherlands, the South African and Australian ministers to the Netherlands, and the diplomatic representatives of India and Pakistan were all present. Bevin reported on the situation of the Hague conference and promised to fully inform the British Commonwealth countries of the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of the Berlin Situation Forces Focus: Soviet Goals in the Ruhr; Future Actions of the Three Powers Contingent on the Outcome of the Hague Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] British official sources stated today that the Western Three Powers will refuse to participate in any discussions with the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade. This applies to the Berlin issue and all other issues. The Three Powers, Britain, the United States, and France, are expected to express this position in their response to the Soviet Union's reply from last week. The Western response may be delivered to the Soviet ambassador in the capitals of the three countries this weekend or early next week, obviously after British Foreign Secretary Bevin returns from the Hague Conference on the evening of the 20th. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office, during a routine briefing for journalists, stated that the three countries have not yet decided on the next step, or even whether they intend to issue another note to the Soviet Union. However, he also said that this statement does not mean that they do not intend to issue another note, "Every possible step is being considered now."</p>
<p>The spokesman reiterated the first protest, stating that there can be no further discussions between the Four Powers until the Berlin blockade is lifted. He said that this refers specifically to the Four Power Command Meeting in Berlin. Other official sources stated that the West "absolutely will not" agree to discuss the German issue with the Soviet Union elsewhere, such as a foreign ministers' conference, until the "cold siege" of Berlin is lifted. One person stated, "If so, then we will be at a disadvantage in negotiations." Although the focus of discussion has shifted to The Hague, British Undersecretary Strang, Ambassador Douglas, and French Ambassador Massigli are still continuing discussions on the Berlin crisis in London. Informed sources say that one of the options currently being considered by Britain, the United States, and France is to issue a final ultimatum to the Soviet Union. Another is to dispatch armored vehicles or armed truck convoys to break through the Berlin blockade with food. Appeals to the Security Council and the International Court of Justice have also been discussed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 19th] Political observers state: The evolution of the current situation in Berlin has reached a focal point. However, the basis of the contention is undoubtedly the issue of permanent control of the Ruhr region. The Soviet Union hopes to develop the Ruhr, which can be seen from its repeated demands for the Four Powers to jointly manage the Ruhr region, but the Western Powers have repeatedly refused.</p>
<p>The situation in Berlin is, in essence, political. The Soviet Union's use of obstructive tactics in the Berlin Four Power Command Meeting to force the Three Powers to establish a West German merger zone is aimed at immediately driving the Three Powers out of Berlin. If the Soviet Union can control Berlin, it means that it has grasped the center, which is recognized by these eighty million German people as the capital of Germany. The second step is to instigate satellite parties scattered throughout Germany to demand that Germany "unite" under the Soviet-controlled Berlin government. If this move succeeds, then the Soviet Union will almost certainly control the Ruhr region. The Allies are also aware of its purpose and know that, with a feigned show of strength, Berlin is merely its starting point. The second step for the Soviet Union is to drive the Allied Powers out of the entire territory of Germany. Therefore, political observers believe that the West will risk war to insist on staying in Berlin.</p>
<h3>US Air Master Aircraft Enhance Berlin Airlift</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Reliable sources say: Seventy giant Air Master aircraft will soon be transferred from the United States to Germany to enhance the airlift between West Germany and Berlin. These aircraft can carry ten tons of cargo each time. If they make three round trips a day, the airlift volume can be increased by 2,100 tons per day. There are already sixty Air Master aircraft serving in Germany. Also, according to the Soviet-controlled Berlin radio station, about ten miles of the Berlin-Helmstedt railway tracks have been dismantled. Soviet officials stated last week that many of the sleepers on that line were rotten and needed to be replaced, but the repair work will be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands of Men and Women Imprisoned in Soviet Concentration Camps in Germany</h3>
<p>Indoctrinating Lenin and Marx</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 18th] The British Occupation Zone's "World Daily News" today published an article on the situation in the Soviet Buchenwald concentration camp. It stated that "In April 1948, 10,000 people were detained in the concentration camp by the Soviet secret police, including 170 women. Most of those imprisoned in the concentration camp were members of the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party, as well as civil servants, etc. The charges were mostly for serving as spies for the Western Allies. Those imprisoned do not know when they will be released. Work is also prohibited in the concentration camp, and they have nothing to do all day long. The daily ration is 300 grams of bread and two bowls of clear soup. Those imprisoned are completely isolated from the outside world. Every three months, they are issued a book on Marx or Lenin, and the prisoners are ordered to read it. Every month, Soviet officials come to the concentration camp to give speeches, the content of which is all about politics, the Soviet revolution, the Soviet Union's reforms, the historical relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, etc.</p>
<h3>Sixty American Superfortresses All Arrive in England</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lincoln City, England, 19th] Fifty-eight of the sixty American Superfortresses stationed temporarily in England have already arrived in England. The last two arrived at their destination today. The British people warmly welcomed the return of their wartime allies to England.</p>
<p>[United Press, Scampton, England, 18th] According to an announcement by the Air Force Information Office: American crew members are staying in Scampton. The Washington and Mahan aircraft are on standby. Major General Warley, the representative of the commander of the US Air Forces in Europe, LeMay, arrived here from Germany yesterday to command the US aircraft. American crew members were busy today organizing aircraft and unloading boxes, which contained repair materials and other equipment.</p>
<h3>British Giant Transport Aircraft Automatically Flies Long Range</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Miles in Twelve Hours</p>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 18th] A US Air Force four-engine transport aircraft has completed its third automatic long-range flight. The aircraft flew 2,100 miles from Wilmington, Iowa, to here in less than twelve hours. During that time, the ten crew members ate, played chess, slept, and did nothing, never touching the controls.</p>
<h3>Southern Countries Boycotted by Romania Turn to Britain and the US to Purchase Oil; Poland Refuses to Attend South Communist Congress</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th, United Press] Diplomatic sources say that Yugoslavia is planning to jointly purchase oil from Western countries, because Romania and Albania are boycotting Yugoslavia and refusing to sell gasoline. Before the conflict between Tito and the Kremlin, the gasoline needed by Yugoslavia came from the Soviet Union. Informed sources say that Yugoslavia has finally contacted agents of British and American Near East oil companies in Trieste to purchase oil. It is reported that the two sides have reached a temporary agreement, but the final arrangements for the transaction have not yet been completed. At the same time, US officials say that there is now more evidence to prove that the Soviet Union hopes to overthrow Tito through continuous economic pressure. It is predicted here that the struggle between Tito and the Kremlin will produce new developments at two meetings to be held in Belgrade in the next twelve days. These two meetings are: (1) the South Communist Congress to be convened on the 21st; (2) the ten-nation Danube River Navigation Freedom Conference to be convened on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 18th] The Polish Communist Party announced its refusal to attend the South Communist Congress, which will open in Belgrade on Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Togliatti Handles Party Affairs from His Sickbed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 19th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti took over party affairs on his sickbed on the 19th. Togliatti's injuries have greatly improved.</p>
<h3>The French Parliament's Vote of Confidence: Schuman Can Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 19th] Former French Prime Minister Herriot assumed a heavy responsibility on the 19th, just in time to save the government at the last minute, enabling it to safely pass the afternoon's vote of confidence. Herriot, in his capacity as an elder statesman, attempted to make his Radical Socialist Party more moderate on the issue of reducing the military budget. He urgently summoned three party leaders, former Prime Minister Daladier, Minister of Justice Maritain, and Gassier, to discuss the matter for an hour. There was no announcement after the meeting, but it was rumored that they believed that they could persuade party members to change their opinions, reach a compromise, and maintain the current government. Herriot's actions made the situation suddenly optimistic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the 19th on Premier Schuman's request regarding the national defense budget. General observations predict that the government can obtain a relatively large number of confidence votes, because in the current tense international situation, the Socialist Party and the Radical Party are unwilling to bring down the government due to cutting the defense budget. Schuman had a long-distance telephone conversation with Foreign Minister Bidault, who is currently in The Hague, yesterday to discuss the domestic political situation.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Air Force's Strength Is Comparable to That of the United States, but It Lacks Navigation Equipment</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The "World Aviation Yearbook" states: The Soviet Air Force's strength is similar to that of the United States. The Soviet Union has a large and modern aircraft industry, but it lacks airfields and navigation equipment. This yearbook is a new publication that provides a detailed description of civil and military aviation in countries around the world, covering about 100 countries in total. The Soviet Air Force is estimated to have 　 one thousand aircraft and 400,000 personnel. Among the aircraft, there are hundreds of jet aircraft and at least one hundred B29 Superfortresses. 42% of the military aircraft are fighter planes. The Soviet Union's strategic bombing force, i.e., long-range bombers, is weak, and there are no aircraft carriers that can be used as forward bases. There are hundreds of airfields, but less than fifty are well-equipped. Even airfields in larger cities lack complete runways, hangars, and adequate passenger terminals. Snow removal equipment is poor, and some airfields cannot be used in winter. Almost all air routes lack lighting equipment and can only be flown in daylight.</p>
<h3>British, American, and French Commanders Confer on Plans to Establish West Germany; Deny Considering Armed Breakthrough of Blockade</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The British, American, and French military governors in Germany met this morning at British military headquarters in Berlin to discuss further implementation of the plan to establish West Germany, and to consider the counter-proposals made by the prime ministers of the eleven West German states regarding the London Conference recommendations. French military governor in Germany, Koenig, arrived by special plane from West Germany to attend the meeting. As the Berlin crisis becomes increasingly tense, former US Intelligence Minister, Major General Donovan, made a speech in Berlin yesterday, advocating economic sanctions against the Soviet Union and its allies. He said that although the airlift system is a temporary measure, the United States must make a resolution, even at the risk of war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 19th] A US official spokesman denied on the evening of the 19th that the British, American, and French military governors would discuss plans to dispatch armed escorts or trains through the Soviet occupation zone to break the blockade.</p>
<h3>US Delegation Departs to Attend Danube River Conference</h3>
<p>[Our News] New York, 19th broadcast: The US delegation left the United States by plane today to attend the ten-nation conference discussing navigation on the Danube River. US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Cannon, will wait in Paris for the delegation to go to the meeting together.</p>
<h3>Truman, Marshall, et al. Confer on Berlin Crisis</h3>

<h3>Major Victory for UN Organization: Arab League Accepts Ceasefire Order; But Still Refuses to Recognize the Existence of the Jewish State</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The Arab League Political Committee, after holding a secret meeting in Aley, Paris, officially announced from Beirut the Arab acceptance of a truce in Palestine. Arab figures stressed that although the Arabs accept the truce, they still refuse to recognize the existence of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>It further stated: Although newspapers and public opinion oppose accepting the truce, the Arab League decided to accept the truce because it was inconvenient to ignore the will of the Great Powers. After the Arab League Political Committee formally accepted the truce, Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi telegraphed Bernadotte's headquarters on Rhodes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 19th] The Arab League countries tonight telegraphed UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, declaring their acceptance of the Security Council's Palestine ceasefire order, but with three conditions attached: (1) During the ceasefire period, the Jewish side will stop immigration; (2) Arab people can return to their homes during this period, and their lives and property must be protected; (3) The ceasefire period must be determined. The telegram was sent by League Secretary-General Azzam. The Jewish authorities had accepted the ceasefire order before the Arab League, but they will definitely oppose the three conditions of the Arab side being accepted by the UN mediator or the Security Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The fact that the Palestine ceasefire order was accepted by both the Arabs and the Jews is generally regarded as the biggest victory for the UN organization. Although the UN had previously facilitated ceasefires twice (once in Indonesia and once in Palestine), they were both in the form of appeals, unlike this time when the Charter was formally invoked to issue an order. This is a major test of the Security Council's power. The notification of the Arab acceptance of the ceasefire order arrived a few hours after the stipulated deadline of 3 p.m. (standard time).</p>
<h3>US Trains South Korean Troops: This Local Force Is Rapidly Expanding; The Korean National Assembly Will Elect the President and Vice President Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 19th] The United States is quietly building a local army in South Korea, the size of which is still a secret, but anyone with a little discernment can see that this army is rapidly expanding. Soldiers in green uniforms are often seen drilling in the fields, and small numbers of soldiers sing and walk in pairs on the streets of Seoul. This organization is nominally called the "Korean Constabulary," but the distinction from the regular army is not very clear. The Constabulary often says that when the US military withdraws, it will leave behind US Army and weapons, because the United States has guaranteed to maintain the Korean state and grant it military power.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The Korean National Assembly, after a two-day recess, is scheduled to secretly vote to elect the President of the Republic of Korea tomorrow morning. The organization of the Korean government can thus become more concrete. The election of the Vice President is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon. Negotiations between the various political parties on the selection of the Prime Minister and one Minister of the State Council (i.e., the Cabinet) are expected to take two weeks to reach an agreement. Therefore, the organization of the government can be completed around August 15. According to the Korean Constitution, the Ministers and the Prime Minister are all appointed by the President, but the selection of the Prime Minister requires the consent of the National Assembly. Dr. Syngman Rhee and Yi Si-yeong (former State Councilor of the Korean Provisional Government in Chongqing) are expected to be elected as President and Vice President. Seo Jae-pil, who was originally a strong rival of Syngman Rhee, has now stated that he will not participate in the election, and will refuse to accept even if elected.</p>
<h3>UN Organization Agrees to International Military Police Guarding Jerusalem</h3>
<p>Bernadotte Is Planning This</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] Informed sources stated today that the UN organization will begin recruiting international volunteers in the next few days to go to Jerusalem to assist in policing. UN Palestine mediator Bernadotte arrived on Rhodes today after flying there today, and his initial task will be to discuss this matter with his staff. Bernadotte consulted with representatives from the United States, France, and Belgium on this plan last week, and it is said that he hopes to first send 250 volunteers, and eventually expand to 1,000 to 1,500. The United States and France have agreed in principle to allow the UN organization to recruit 355 people from each of those countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 18th] UN Palestine mediator Bernadotte arrived here today by special plane from the Dutch capital via Geneva. He will stay overnight and fly to Rhodes tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting in Northern Palestine Between Arabs and Jews</h3>
<p>[Our News] Haifa, 19th broadcast: Large-scale warfare is continuing throughout northern Palestine. The Arab army ignored the truce order and launched a strong counter-offensive in the area of Jenin. At the same time, Syrian troops are also pressing towards the Jewish positions on the southern shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<h3>Katayama's Request to Dissolve the Diet Shocks the Japanese Political World; Rumors that the Cabinet Will Convene an Extraordinary Session of the Diet in September</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The statement by the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Tetsu Katayama, expressing his desire to request the dissolution of the Diet after the opening of the upcoming Extraordinary Diet, has shocked the Japanese political world. For Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, who clings to his position, it is as if cold water has been poured on him. Katayama's statement, made in Sendai in northern Honshu, has aggravated the crisis of the Ashida Cabinet. Katayama's statement indicates that the Social Democratic Party intends to cooperate with the Democratic Liberal Party, the largest opposition party, after the start of the Diet session to request the dissolution of the Diet and pass this motion. The attitude of the occupying authorities on the issue of dissolving the Diet is still unknown. In short, since this motion still depends on the attitude of the General Headquarters, it may be rejected and not be submitted to the Diet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] According to sources close to the Chief Cabinet Secretary, the Cabinet is preparing to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet in early September, and seems to have decided to face the major issue of dissolution on the day of the convocation. Most of the bills to be discussed in the Extraordinary Diet are related to labor issues, and on these issues, the opinions of the Democratic and National Cooperative Parties are diametrically opposed to those of the Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>Japanese Communist Party Leader Seriously Injured in Assassination Attempt</h3>
<p>Injured in More Than Thirty Places by a Hand Grenade Explosion</p>
<p>[Our News] Tokyo, 19th broadcast: When Japanese Communist Party leader Tokuda was giving a speech to a crowd of three thousand in Saga City, Kyushu, on the 19th, someone suddenly threw a hand grenade at him. He suffered serious injuries on the spot, with a total of thirty-eight wounds caused by shrapnel fragments all over his body. However, he continued to speak, and only collapsed twenty minutes later due to excessive blood loss. He was immediately taken to the hospital. According to doctors, his injuries are still in good condition. The assassin, named Koga, is a 27-year-old miner who surrendered to the police after the incident. The motive for the assassination is unknown.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the US Presidential Election (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>The Democratic Party's current unfavorable campaign situation is not only due to Truman's lack of prestige. Tracing back to the Roosevelt era, diplomatic errors have been gradually revealed by Republican public opinion. Every time Americans mention the Berlin incident, every time they mention the Czech coup, they are indignant at the so-called "Yalta Secret Agreement." The widely circulated "Saturday Evening Post" had a long article on the Czech coup, which was entirely due to the Yalta Secret Agreement stipulating: "The capitals of all countries east of the Elbe River occupied by the Nazis will be liberated by the Soviet Red Army." As a result, General Patton was outside the gates of Prague but still waited for the Soviet Union to occupy it first, leading to today's consequences. A recent editorial in New York's largest-selling "Daily News" stated that today's stalemate in Berlin was also caused by the Yalta Secret Agreement stipulating that the capitals east of the Elbe River would be liberated by the Red Army. Every time the American people think of the shame of the Yalta Secret Agreement, they express disappointment in the Democratic Party's foreign policy. During the Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia last month, someone publicly cursed Roosevelt, from Roosevelt to Truman.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall's stubbornness and disorganized actions are also a major reason for creating an unfavorable situation for Truman. On the Palestine issue, the Truman administration's foreign policy has changed repeatedly, and in the end, it hastily made an inappropriate "recognition," disappointing the Jewish people in the United States. Another example is Ambassador Smith's "exchange of notes" in Moscow, which aroused great resentment from Britain and France, all of which were extremely unwise and reckless actions. Its wavering foreign policy towards China has aroused great criticism from the Republican Party. From whatever angle one observes, the reckless diplomacy of Truman and Marshall has made the American people feel weary.</p>
<p>On the Republican side, Dewey, in his many speeches before the National Convention, was simple, concise, and clear in his diplomatic principles. But Dewey modestly told any reporter friends: "I am not familiar with diplomacy. Everything should be consulted with my advisor, Dulles." In Dewey's list of future cabinet members, the position of Secretary of State first belonged to Vandenberg. If Vandenberg does not take the position, Dulles will be asked. This gave the American people a clear and exciting impression.</p>
<p>If one speaks purely in terms of foreign policy and policy toward China, Dewey's election would be beneficial to China. Dewey mentioned speeding up aid to China in every speech. In his fourteen-point program, "Aid to China" was specifically designated as one point. Dewey also reminded American diplomats to respect the leadership position of China's President Chiang, which should be a prerequisite for all aid, which is a very wise view.</p>

<h3>Disruption of Power Plant Case: Yesterday's Verdict, Two Sentenced to Death, One to Lengthy Imprisonment; Wu Shishen and Four Others Sentenced for Treason</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wang Xiaohe, a standing director of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's industrial union, along with ten others, were accused of participating in the Communist Party. On March 30th of this year, they allegedly placed iron filings into the ground shaft of a converter, attempting to cause the machine to explode and create chaos. After investigation by the garrison command's special criminal court prosecutor, a public prosecution was filed. Following a trial by the court's judges, the verdict was announced yesterday as follows: Wang Xiaohe, for continuous incitement with the intent to undermine suppression of rebellion and disturb public order (attempted), was sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights for life. Wu Guozhen, for intending to undermine suppression of rebellion and disturb public order (attempted), was sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights for life. Zhang Shibao, for assisting with the intent to undermine suppression of rebellion and disturb public order (attempted), was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for life. Wu Shishen, for participating in a group with the intention of destroying organizations and seizing national territory, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for two years. Tan A Si, for participating in a group with the intention of destroying organizations and seizing national territory, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for two years. Chen Longgen and Shi Jingen, for participating in a group with the intention of destroying organizations and seizing national territory, were sentenced to one year of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for one year. Huang Hongxun was exempted from punishment. Shen Hongsheng is at large. Zhao Jingen awaits further secret handling.</p>
<p>The facts of the case: Wang Xiaohe and others had previously joined the Communist Party. On March 26th of this year, Wang Xiaohe, Huang Hongxun, Wu Shishen, Shen Hongsheng, and others secretly met for the first time at Wu Shishen's home. Wang proposed using bombs to destroy the power plant, but Huang Hongxun opposed it. Shen Hongsheng also argued that using violence to damage the generator might not garner public sympathy and advocated for a mass struggle approach. The meeting ended without a resolution. Later, Shen and Wang secretly agreed to use "AA" as a secret code. Eleven days later, Shen sent someone to Wang, instructing him to find a way to place iron filings to damage the Yangshupu power plant. Once the machine exploded and the electricity stopped, Shanghai would be plunged into darkness, causing workers to leave the factory and petition the government, creating a situation of terror. Wang first instructed Jiang Xinggen, a worker in the factory's shed department, to place the iron filings, but Jiang was too afraid to do so. He then ordered Wu Guozhen and Zhang Shibao, workers in the oil room, to do it. On March 30th of this year, Zhang Shibao found the iron filings and handed them to Wu Guozhen, who placed them in the ground shaft of converter numbers 2 and 3. On April 1st, around 1:00 PM, Wang Feiyun, an intern technician, inspected the machine and discovered the anomaly. He reported it to the factory's engineers, who managed to salvage and clean the machine. The defendants' conspiracy ultimately failed. Afterward, the garrison command learned of the situation and arrested the defendants one after another, transferring them to the special court for investigation and prosecution. The case was then transferred to the criminal court for trial, which has now concluded with the verdict as stated above.</p>
<h3>Eight Locations Raided in Gold and Foreign Exchange Profiteering Case; "One of the Four Kings," You Minsheng, Narrowly Escapes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The police bureau's detective brigade dispatched teams yesterday to raid nine establishments involved in the private exchange of Hong Kong currency and black market gold. However, You Minsheng, a well-known black market gold tycoon and manager of the Fusheng and Fuchang cigarette shops on Sichuan Middle Road, managed to escape after hearing about the raids.

<h3>Relevant Authorities Agree on Principles for Inspecting Private Warehouses</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Assembly, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Garrison Command, and the Police Bureau yesterday morning to discuss the issue of inspecting "private warehouses." After deliberation, it was decided that "private warehouses" storing nine types of daily necessities exceeding three months' worth of business needs would be subject to inspection. The key points for implementing warehouse inspections, previously approved in principle by the Municipal Affairs Council, have been finalized by the Social Affairs Bureau and will be announced today. [Our Report] Warehouse inspections in this city are being conducted by five teams from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and the Gendarmerie Corps. After two days of inspections, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that due to the vast area and the mountainous stockpiles of goods, it was difficult to conduct a thorough inspection in a short time. He has mobilized representatives from all districts through the Civil Affairs Bureau and encouraged workers in civilian ships, steamships, docks, transportation, loading, and unloading to report large hoarders who break up their stocks to evade inspection. If verified, the hoarded goods will be auctioned off, and informers will receive 20% of the proceeds as a reward to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Call on the Mayor to Request Instructions on Controlling Various Markets</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Responsible persons from the rice, flour, miscellaneous grains, and oil cake markets in this city, as well as representatives from grain and oil merchants, numbering more than ten, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday morning to request instructions on how to control the various markets after the issuance of the large denomination banknotes. Mayor Wu immediately and earnestly advised that all industries should exercise self-restraint. Rumors of the issuance of large denomination banknotes have been circulating for a long time, and the prices of various commodities have already risen to their limits. Now that the large denomination banknotes are being issued as needed, commodity prices should not fluctuate further.</p>
<h3>Director of Social Affairs Bureau Urges All Industries to Exercise Self-Restraint on Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the issuance of the large denomination banknotes, reporters interviewed Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau regarding the impact and countermeasures for factories and commodity prices. He stated that he had summoned the responsible persons from the rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains markets to urge them to restrain commodity prices and refrain from arbitrary price increases. The amount of legal tender issued has reached a level of malignant inflation. From the perspective of factories, employers are struggling to pay huge wages, but the workers' earnings are not enough to make ends meet. Both sides are dissatisfied. However, in his opinion, low wages are still better than unemployment. Therefore, during this difficult time, labor and management should coordinate and understand each other in order to overcome this challenge.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Issues Emergency Order Instructing Dyeing and Weaving Workers to Resume Work</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The labor-management dispute in the dyeing and weaving industry in the Hudong district has not yet been resolved, and some workers continue to strike. The Social Affairs Bureau issued an emergency order yesterday, instructing the trade unions of six dyeing and weaving factories, including Yida, Dagong, Xinxin, Renfeng, Yizhong, and Yumin, to persuade workers to resume work first, and for labor and management to resolve the issues through negotiation. It is reported that for factories that delay wage payments by half a month, employers may accept the workers' demands to pay wages based on the cost of living index for the current month.</p>
<h3>American Philanthropist Byer Calls on Mayor Wu Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Byer, the president of the American Al-Islam Association, a great American philanthropist, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday.

<h3>Two Airline Companies May Receive Special Foreign Exchange to Purchase Fuel; Passenger Registration Difficult to Resume in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Airfares have been approved by the Ministry of Communications for a 150% increase. However, passenger registration for the two airline companies is difficult to resume in the short term. The suspension of flights between Beijing and Shanghai and the reduction of flights will also continue for the time being, as fare adjustments are not a fundamental solution. Minister Yu in Beijing has discussed with Premier Weng the possibility of providing the civil aviation industry with a special allocation of foreign exchange to purchase gasoline, which may soon be realized. The adjusted fares from Shanghai to various locations are as follows: Beijing, 137,500,000 yuan; Chongqing, 182,800,000 yuan; Lanzhou, 197,000,000 yuan; Guangzhou, 187,900,000 yuan; Nanjing, 13,000,000 yuan; Hankou, 94,500,000 yuan; Hong Kong, 224,900,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Names of Victims in Macau Plane Crash Gradually Revealed; Coca-Cola Manager Dies; Famous Clergyman and Family Perish</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A "Catalina" aircraft of the Cathay Pacific Airways flying from Macau to Hong Kong crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Macau on the 17th due to an engine explosion. Among the 26 passengers, only one, Huang Yaomin, was rescued. It has now been learned that among the deceased passengers, after identifying the bodies recovered, it was discovered that Wu Shouwen, the Shanghai China Manager of the American Coca-Cola Company, and Nelson, the head of the Lutheran Church China Relief Association, who had been in China for many years, were also among them.

He himself took his wife to Hong Kong to visit his seven sisters, who were all on summer vacation, and to investigate the Coca-Cola market in Macau to plan the company's sales network in South China. Unexpectedly, he encountered this tragic accident.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson's trip was originally a vacation. His entire family went with him, including his wife, his sixteen-year-old eldest daughter, and his nine-year-old youngest son. The entire family perished together.</p>
<p>The body of Mr. Situ, the district manager of Texaco Oil Company, was found on the 17th and has been buried in Macau. Huang Yaomin, the only survivor of the accident, is recuperating in a Macau hospital. He stated that an engine exploded before the accident. Many fishing boats are still working to recover bodies.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Accountants Association Collects Special Relief Donations of 2.2 Billion</h3>

<h3>High Court Orders Retrial of Two Defendants in Embezzlement Case Involving Administrative Relief Personnel; Hou Aichang Forcefully Denies House Was a Gift; Jiang Renlin Defends That Reserve Funds Were Once Short</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the case of senior Administrative Relief personnel accused of group embezzlement, the District Court's initial trial sentenced Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin to three years of imprisonment each. The remaining defendants, Dong Chengdao and others, were acquitted or had their cases dismissed. Hou and Jiang were dissatisfied and requested a retrial. After review by the High Court, the parts of Hou Aichang's case related to electric fans and cotton were approved, and the court deemed that the judgment regarding the house donation was erroneous, and ordered a retrial by the District Court.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the District Court, presided over by Judge Wu Xiangzu, heard the case. In addition to summoning the two defendants, Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin, witnesses Wu Zhiwei and Deng Zhonghe were also summoned to testify. Hou stated in his defense: "Since I began handling the allocation of materials, I have only sold 710,000 pounds of wool. Apart from Zhongfang, Anle and Zhanghua received equal allocations. However, Zhanghua only represented a small portion. In the third allocation, Zhanghua gave up their share because the wool was coarse and unsuitable. At the same time, Anle's equipment and production volume were better, so their needs were greater. As for the house issue, the prosecutor's claim that it was a gift from Deng is not supported by evidence. They also did not consider the evidence I presented. Deng was a sub-landlord and could not give someone else's house away. Later, because there was no lease agreement, I wrote a letter to replace the lease." Witness Deng Zhonghe testified: "I have a close relationship with Wu Zhiwei, so I let him live in the house on Yuyuan Road. The rent was calculated in US dollars per month. The prosecutor's claim that I gave the house to Hou Aichang is biased." Regarding the wool allocation, he stated that Anle's production volume was eight to ten times greater than that of Huazhang. The wool used was coarse wool, but the business actually lost money, so there was no commission. Hou's brother-in-law, Wu Zhiwei, then testified regarding the house issue. Defendant Jiang Renlin then stated: "The reserve funds for managing welfare affairs were specifically used for inland visitors staying in hotels. I was in charge of these funds. Because they were temporary advances, I did not need to seek approval from superiors. Later, when the accounts were checked, there was no shortage. There was even a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan. When dealing with welfare affairs, it is inevitable to offend people." The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Garrison Command's Investigation Department Ceases Economic Inspection Work; Unfinished Matters Submitted to Relevant Authorities for Handling</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command previously assisted government authorities in implementing measures to suppress commodity prices, as the soaring prices in this city posed a threat to public order. It is now learned that the central government will establish an agency to manage the city's economy. The Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus are responsible for routine management. Military agencies' handling of price controls was originally a temporary measure. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Garrison Command specifically stated that the government has other means to manage the city's economy. The Command will only collect economic intelligence. All other work will be handled by the relevant authorities, and the Command will no longer carry it out. The Investigation Department has been ordered to cease economic inspection activities immediately. Unfinished matters will be organized and submitted to the relevant authorities for handling. Proposes Further In-Depth Discussion</p>
<p>Legislator Xi Yushu, taking leave due to the passing of his mother, is in Shanghai and unable to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting in Beijing. He has submitted written suggestions regarding the temporary property tax issue: (1) Do not make a formal decision during this session. Allow each committee member to further study and discuss the issue in depth during the recess. After the session resumes, submit the issue to the assembly for detailed discussion. (2) Submit the current draft to the government for referral to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along with relevant departments, to jointly compile a budget for the property tax based on the regulations. It is also necessary to study the following key issues. (A) The possible amount that can be collected. (B) The timeframe within which the full amount can be collected. (C) Whether there are obstacles to collecting taxes on Chinese citizens' property abroad and foreigners' property within China. (D) How much the tax revenue would actually contribute to balancing the budget. Submit these findings to the Legislative Yuan for reference before the session resumes to provide a basis for discussion.</p>

<h3>Tang Boqi's Birthday; Offering Congratulations and Donations for Education</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Bochang, a reader of this newspaper, recently celebrated his sixtieth birthday. Friends and relatives sent congratulatory gifts. Mr. Tang, realizing the difficult times, did not want to engage in excessive celebrations. Therefore, he donated 100 million yuan in congratulatory gifts to the "Readers' Scholarship Fund" to help impoverished students and benefit all his friends and relatives. Mr. Tang's frugality in supporting education and his dedication to charity are admirable. It is hoped that people in Shanghai will respond and launch a frugal education support movement, so that the "Readers' Scholarship Fund" can achieve its expected goals as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Eight Major Public Utilities Face Losses of Over One Trillion This Month; Authorities Are Currently Studying Methods to Maintain Operations; Monthly Fees May Be Adjusted Twice in the Future</h3>
<p>The eight major public utility companies in this city, including the British Shanghai Waterworks, Shanghai Electric Power, Shanghai Telephone, British Tramway, French Water and Electricity, Gas, Shangchuan and Shangnan Railways, and the Municipal Ferry, are now facing a serious crisis. Company representatives have stated that they are on the verge of collapse in the short term. There are two reasons for this: (1) The implementation of the new foreign exchange policy from July 1st; (2) The publication of the cost of living index every half month. With commodity prices soaring, the total shortfalls for all companies this month are over one trillion yuan, with the French Yongdian Company having the largest deficit, exceeding 600 billion yuan. After the release of the index for the first half of the month, which showed an increase of over 90%, the companies used funds originally intended for purchasing materials to pay wages, making it impossible to purchase materials. The public utility companies jointly submitted a written request to the Public Utilities Bureau for assistance the day before yesterday. Director Zhao summoned representatives of the French Water and Electricity Company for talks at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It was decided to report the situation to Mayor Wu and seek a loan from the Central Bank to alleviate the immediate crisis. Mayor Wu and Director Zhao are currently studying fundamental solutions for the coming month, which may include: (1) Adjusting prices twice a month. (2) Collecting a certain amount in advance from major users at the beginning of the month, with a final settlement to be made later.</p>
<h3>Fare Evasion Reaches 50 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Public Transportation Company's gasoline quota for July has been reduced by another 20 gallons per vehicle, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the operation of each route. According to Mr. Wang Zongshan, the head of the Traffic Group of the company, since routes 7 and 2A were suspended, the company has faced criticism from various sectors. However, the company also has its own difficulties. If the gasoline problem cannot be resolved, not only will these two routes be unable to resume service, but other routes will also consider reducing the number of vehicles or suspending service altogether. The company's peak operation involved 245 vehicles on all routes, but this number has now been reduced to 212 vehicles. As for fare evasion by military personnel, it has not only not decreased but is increasing daily. According to recent observations and statistics, fare evasion accounts for more than 50% of the total ridership.</p>
<h3>News Media Workers Encounter Difficulties in Purchasing Special Ration Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee grants special rationed rice to news media workers. Starting this month, special ration certificates have been issued, stipulating that recipients can purchase rice from any grain ration store within the district specified on their family ration book. However, some rice stores in various districts have refused to sell the rice. These stores may not be aware of the regulations, misunderstand the meaning of special rationed rice, or even intentionally create difficulties. The affected news media workers are frustrated and hope that the Civil Food Allocation Committee authorities will investigate and implement effective improvements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, a reporter from this newspaper personally went to the Shentaijiu Rice Store, No. 30, East End, Luzhouan District, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Zhongzheng South Road, at 1:40 PM yesterday afternoon, carrying a special ration certificate along with his family ration book to purchase rice. As expected, the store refused to sell the rice, claiming that they had "not received notification." Despite the reporter's gentle explanation, it was ineffective. The store refused to call the Civil Food Allocation Committee for clarification. After more than half an hour of negotiation, the store finally agreed to send an apprentice to the Xieda Rice Store on Chengdu South Road to inquire. Xieda said that "it could be sold," but the Shentaijiu Rice Store still refused to sell the reporter the special rationed rice, despite the complete paperwork. Similar situations have reportedly occurred in the Songshan, North Station, Jing'an Temple, Putuo, and Changshu districts.</p>
<h3>Five Fugitives from Songjiang Arrested One After Another in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Songjiang County Police Bureau sent a document to Shanghai Police Bureau on the 18th, requesting assistance in arresting a group of fugitive criminals. After dispatch by the Detective Section of the Police Bureau, five suspects, Xu Hanmin (also known as Xu Daye), Jia Yushan, Shao Jinyou, Wu Decai, and Cai Jinbiao, were successively arrested at a thatched shed at a certain address in Jingyi Lane, Tongji Road, and on Nanmen Road.

Wu and Cai are still under investigation as they also committed theft in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>From Emperor Taizong of Tang to the Flower and Tree Industry: Establishing the 12th of Each Month as a Gathering Day Based on a Myth; Zhou Zhi, a Veteran of the 1911 Revolution, "Leading All Flowers"</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Legend has it that Emperor Taizong Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty was extremely fond of flowers. On the 12th of the second lunar month, a date associated with Yin energy, he "ordered" all flowers to bloom. As a result, they blossomed as he wished. Empress Wu Zetian also "commanded" it once, but while all the other flowers bloomed, only the peony refused. Therefore, it was banished to Luoyang. It is said that the peonies in any other place are not as good as those in Luoyang, though no one can say why. The flower and tree industry has designated the 12th of the second lunar month as the birthday of the flower deity. Aside from explaining this through the aforementioned myth, there is no other "historical basis" for it. This year, the Flower and Tree Industry Association of this city held a grand temple fair for the flower deity, who had been sheltered in western Shanghai during the war against Japan. The deity was brought back to the association's old location on Liyuan Road in Xiejiao. Every year on this day, there is a grand sacrificial ceremony. However, to facilitate communication among association members, it is now stipulated that gatherings be held on the 12th of each lunar month. Members burn incense before the flower deity while also discussing association affairs. The day before yesterday was the 12th of the lunar month, and the reporter happened to attend the meeting, collecting a great deal of interesting information from many of the association's leaders.</p>
<p>Gardening for Forty Years</p>
<p>Huang Yueyuan, the chairman of the association, can be considered a giant in the flower and tree industry. A veteran of the 1911 Revolution, he has devoted himself to the study of flower and tree gardening for nearly forty years. Huang Yuan on Kangping Road in this city is the result of his hard work, filled with rare and precious plants. In addition, he has a large garden in Zhenru covering over three hundred acres. He admits that the value of the flowers and trees alone is inestimable today.</p>
<p>Regarding roses alone, his garden has over eighty varieties, totaling more than two thousand plants. He even managed to obtain six plants of the newest 1948 rose variety, bred in the United States the year before last, competed for last year, and sold this year. He achieved this by having his child bring a carpet to his American friend while studying in the United States. He has now propagated them to eighteen plants. Each plant is currently worth about five US dollars. Other common varieties also sell for thirty to fifty cents. The value of these flowers, which come in purple, yellow, bright red, vermillion, and other colors, with beautiful shapes and pleasant fragrances, and which are highly favored by foreigners, is enough to leave us speechless. Good rose varieties are often named after world celebrities by Americans, including Roosevelt, Truman, and even Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the First Lady of China, totaling more than a dozen. Huang's garden has managed to collect every single one of them, making them even more precious.</p>
<p>Producing Many Floral Masters</p>
<p>There is also the rare black and yellow peony. Because it was previously open to the public for viewing, it was stolen completely. Now, Huang has hidden it away in a secret room and is reluctant to show it to anyone. Other potted plants include the so-called "Twelve Golden Hairpins" and "Five Great Pines." To those who are addicted to flowers, seeing good flowers and trees can make them forget to eat and sleep. Living among them is like being surrounded by books, a joy that others can never experience.</p>
<p>Among the trees, the most precious is the "Eight Great Camellias": pine, snow, boxthorn, plum, winter jasmine, yellow jasmine, euonymus, and cypress. Among them, the pine category includes the northern Chinese *Pinus bungeana* (white bark pine) and the Japanese five-needle pine. The cypress category includes *Chamaecyparis obtusa* and *Juniperus chinensis*. A *Juniperus chinensis* three *zhang* tall is worth fifteen taels of gold. Huang has a five-hundred-year-old *Chamaecyparis obtusa* that he says he has cultivated for over forty years and would not sell for any amount of gold. In order to arrange the flowers and trees in a pleasing and beautiful way, many famous floral masters have emerged. The Japanese have done a lot of research in this field. It is said that the flower arrangement in the Great World entertainment center in the early years of the Republic of China was done by the Japanese. There are still such talents in Shanghai today!</p>
<p>A Flower Basket Costs Tens of Millions</p>
<p>Regarding the source of flowers for street vendors and the city's 117 flower shops, they are traded at the association every day. The more valuable flowers from the Caohejing area in the southern suburbs and the herbaceous flowers from the Caojia Garden area in the northern suburbs are transported to the association by flower farmers before four o'clock every morning and sold freely to members until six o'clock. There is also a transaction around four o'clock in the afternoon. When there are festive occasions, the liveliness here is beyond description. Although flower farmers try to raise prices, sales are still brisk. Currently, the most common flowers are freesias, lotuses, carnations, and tuberoses. Outsiders cannot tell the difference between good and bad, but their asking prices can vary by four to five hundred thousand yuan per dozen. When the flowers reach the stalls and flower shops, their value increases again. The Changchun, Yuquan, Huamei, and Xiahui flower shops on Lin Sen Middle Road are the largest in the city. The price of a flower basket can range from one million to tens of millions, but only foreigners can afford such high prices.</p>
<p>Writing this, I am reminded of something. Huang Yueyuan told the reporter: He has many camellias in his garden, but their tender branches are always eaten by many rough-colored small insects. He has experimented for over thirty years and used various medicines without success. He now wants to solicit "secret tips." Whoever can contribute a truly effective method of eliminating the insects will receive one hundred million yuan in legal tender as a reward.</p>

<h3>Fire on Huashan Road Last Night: Destroyed Lumberyard and Affected Shantytowns</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A fire suddenly broke out last night at 10:30 at the Fuxing Lumberyard of the Huang family warehouse on Huashan Road, Xujiahui. It quickly spread, becoming intense. After receiving the report, the Huashan Road Fire Department rushed to the scene with pump trucks to extinguish the fire. By about 12:00, the fire was under control. As a result, in addition to the complete destruction of the lumberyard, the fire also affected more than ten shantytown wooden houses behind it. Fortunately, no one was injured. The building owner, Lou Engui, along with the carpenter Xia Xingpei, were both taken to the Xujiahui Police Sub-Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Workers at Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory Demand Three Points</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau scheduled mediation for today.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Workers at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory are in dispute over wage issues. The workers have put forward three demands: (1) The wages for the first half of the month should be paid according to the index at the end of last month, and the wages for the second half of the month should be paid according to the index of the current month. (2) Advance half a month's salary. (3) Distribute three *dou* of white rice per person per month.

<h3>Domestic Film Companies Jointly Request to Settle Foreign Exchange Monthly for Purchasing Film Stock</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Domestic film producers in this city have recently experienced difficulties in importing film stock. They have jointly requested the government to approve a monthly foreign exchange allocation of US$60,000 to purchase film stock from abroad and to ease restrictions on the import of film production equipment. Their petition states the following reasons: Domestic films have a market in Southeast Asia, so the foreign exchange paid for purchasing film stock can still be recovered from Southeast Asia and even far exceed the amount spent. For example, in February and March, the government provided foreign exchange of over HK$70,000 to purchase film stock, while the foreign exchange recovered by the film industry from the Southeast Asian market exceeded HK$160,000. In addition, 30% of the government's entertainment tax revenue comes from domestic films, and films also have educational value. Therefore, the film industry's foreign exchange purchases should be given special treatment.</p>
<h3>Driver Shooting Case: Allen Sentenced to Three and a Half Years</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the case of Allen, a former driver for China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), shooting and killing driver Shen Zuyao, in addition to the civil suit, which was settled through negotiations with both parties agreeing to US$2,500, Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court concluded the criminal aspect yesterday and announced the main text of the judgment: "Allen is sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for causing death through injury." Allen, wearing a gray gabardine suit and no tie, stood in the defendant's dock and stated in court that he disagreed with the verdict and would appeal.</p>
<h3>Delayed Parole Due to Official Procedures: Prisoner Released After Serving Full Term; Submits Petition to the City Council</h3>
<p>Shen Junping, a prisoner recently released after serving his full term, submitted a petition yesterday to the Human Rights Protection Committee of the City Council, urging the simplification of official procedures so that paroled prisoners can have the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves sooner. According to him, among the more than fifty prisoners in Shanghai Prison who have been approved for parole this year, only three have been released before the end of their sentence after approval by the Ministry of Judicial Administration due to slow official procedures. Last winter, two months before the end of his sentence, he and twenty-six other prisoners were approved by the prison affairs meeting to be included in the first batch of parole candidates. The prison authorities submitted a document to the High Court in January to be forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval. It was not until March 7 that the Ministry order was received, approving the parole of Zhang and two others. During the parole ceremony, it was learned that Zhang and the two others had received special favor as a result of the High Court selecting them from the list of twenty-six and submitting their names to the Ministry in advance. The remaining prisoners, due to the "miracle" of official procedures, are still longing for the grace of parole, which remains as elusive as a reflection in a mirror.</p>

<h3>Rainfall Breaks Records: Midsummer Like Early Autumn</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Recently, due to the continental high-pressure system covering the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the temperature in this city has dropped sharply. The average daily temperature is only around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is significantly lower than the average temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit in mid-July last year. Therefore, although it is still midsummer, mornings and evenings are already like early autumn. The clear west wind is refreshing and quite cool on the face. Furthermore, the amount of rainfall in this city in the past month is also likely to break historical records. In June, only the last ten days saw 119.7 millimeters of rainfall, while the highest total rainfall for the entire month of June in history was no more than 183.1 millimeters. In July, as of the 15th, 123.0 millimeters of rainfall has already fallen, while the highest total rainfall for the entire month of July in history was only 148.0 millimeters. According to the weather forecast, there will still be intermittent heavy rain in this city within the week, so it is almost certain that the rainfall for this month will exceed historical records. Due to excessive rainfall, the arrival of the cold southern air currents has been slower, and the climate has become abnormal as a result. The consequences will affect the expected harvest of crops. Yesterday's temperature: minimum 23.2 degrees Celsius (73.7 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 28.7 degrees Celsius (83.6 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

Unexpectedly, with a loud bang, it immediately exploded, and iron fragments flew everywhere, injuring Fang's lower jaw, chest, and other areas. An apprentice, Zhao Cailin (15 years old, from Changshu), was also injured in the head. Both were taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the old copper tube was actually an anti-aircraft shell, and Fang Xuebao did not recognize the object, causing the disaster.</p>

<h3>Peng E, the "Tiger General" of Siping, Who Emerged from the Barrage of Bullets with his Life</h3>
<p>— Yang Yiming, Reporter from this Newspaper</p>
<p>[Suzhou, 18th of this Month] I remember back in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, Xie Jinyuan, regimental adjutant, and Yang Ruifu, battalion commander, of the 524th Regiment of the 262nd Brigade of the 88th Division, led eight hundred brave soldiers to hold steadfastly to the Sihang Warehouse, covering the retreat of the main force. These awe-inspiring, tear-jerking soldiers of the Sihang Lone Army were renowned throughout the world and almost became legendary heroes. This spirit of bravery, skillful fighting, and disregard for death has been fully preserved and expanded by General Peng E, the successor to the regimental commander, enabling the prestigious 88th Division to fully display its traditional glory when Peng rose to the rank of division commander and defended Siping.</p>
<p>Numerous Military Achievements</p>
<p>Han Xianyuan, commander of the 524th Regiment, soon died in action in the battle of Huatai in Nanjing. His successor was General Peng. Starting in the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic, 1938], he fought along the Longhai Railway, on the outskirts of Wuhan, and in various locations in southeastern Shanxi, rising through the ranks to become the commander of the 87th Division due to his military merits. During the counteroffensive in the 33rd year [of the Republic, 1944], Peng led his brave soldiers on an expedition to Yunnan and Burma, fully demonstrating the fighting power of the Chinese Army. He was praised by the supreme leader for his contribution to the capture of Mangshi and Ruili.</p>
<p>After the victory, Peng was appointed as the surrender commissioner and garrison commander of the Nantong and Haimen areas in northern Jiangsu. He properly handled the surrender of prisoners and the suppression of bandits. Soon, he was transferred to the Northeast, recovering Bamiencheng and Liaoyang, Tongliao, and other places. In May of the 36th year [of the Republic, 1947], Peng was transferred to his original position as commander of the 88th Division, stationed in Siping. Before long, the communist bandits attacked, and he led his troops in a bitter battle for forty-two days, directing the battle with blood-soaked wounds to his leg and back, finally repelling the stubborn bandits. This time, Peng gained full practical experience regarding the geographical situation of Siping and the conditions for attack and defense, which was the main reason why he was able to successfully lead his troops in breaking through the encirclement after completing his mission in the second defense of Siping.</p>
<p>Fighting Alone</p>
<p>In February of this spring, the communist bandits gathered six columns, five independent divisions, and one artillery brigade, possessing new weapons such as heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and tanks. They launched another frenzied offensive in the Northeast, first capturing Kaiyuan and gradually completing the encirclement of Siping. At this time, Peng led his troops to garrison Siping, ordered to hold firm in order to cover the assembly and southward retreat of the Jilin-Changchun army and ensure the overall situation in the Northeast. He led only two infantry regiments of his command to meet the enemy bandits, who were fifteen times more numerous. They fought valiantly, making the bandits pay the highest price for every inch of land.</p>
<p>However, after the mission was accomplished, the lone army was already in the midst of heavy encirclement, and the original plan to evacuate by air had become a bubble. On February 29, the communist bandits began their general offensive on Siping, with dozens of heavy artillery pieces bombarding the city in turns, and using tanks to cover the charge. The battle was extremely fierce. The bandits infiltrated and broke through everywhere, like a flood. By March 13, all strongholds had fallen into the hands of the bandits, and the city was a sea of fire. News of the Siping lone army, which everyone was concerned about, was cut off.</p>
<p>Successful Breakthrough</p>
<p>On March 15, the bandits broadcast their war results to the world, saying that the Siping garrison had been completely annihilated and the defending general, Peng E, had been killed in action. This news could certainly confuse or mislead at the time. Peng's friends in Shenyang had already begun preparing to hold a memorial service for Peng. Suddenly, shocking news arrived: Peng had actually led his troops through the bandits' two hundred and forty *li* multi-layered encirclement and broken through! This cannot but be called a miracle. Peng and Deputy Division Commander Huang Wenhui, with only nineteen guards left at their side, arrived in Tieling on the evening of the 16th, truly surviving nine deaths to find one life, exhausted and on the verge of collapse. Subsequently, the brave soldiers who escorted the breakthrough arrived one after another, and the total number of officers and soldiers who broke through actually amounted to more than 1,300.</p>
<p>Leg Wounded</p>
<p>This news drove Shenyang into a frenzy. The memorial service being prepared was immediately changed to a welcome ceremony. The Shenyang, Changchun, Tianjin, and other newspapers all reported on this event like a myth, praising Peng as the "Tiger General of Siping." Not long after, Peng was summoned to Nanjing because his leg was wounded by shrapnel, and he was hospitalized for treatment. Peng is a native of Hunan, 38 years old, and a graduate of the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. He has a sturdy body and abundant energy. Although the injury to his leg soon healed, he still walks with a slight limp.</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, Peng was assigned to Suzhou to take over as the commander of the Youth Army's 202nd Division. After the initial deployment was completed, he hosted various sectors of society and put forward the slogan "To Love the People, One Must First Protect the People." The 202nd Division was originally a well-established new army. Now, under the leadership of this vigorous young general, it is bound to have even more heroic and greater achievements.</p>

<h3>Golden Leopards Appear in Wushan Township, Fenghua</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Ningbo, 19th] In the Lujia Dun area of Wushan Township, Fenghua, groups of golden leopards have been discovered for days, scurrying around nearby villages and devouring livestock. Villagers are panicking and forming hunting parties to kill them.</p>
<h3>Wang Lingji Plans to Not Confer Titles on Local Chieftains for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Chongqing, 18th] Regarding the titles of Su Yonghe and Suo Guanhuan, the two headmen in western Sichuan's Li County, Zhu Shaoliang had instructed Wang Lingji to handle them carefully. Wang has now reported that in addition to Su Yonghe, there are other powerful headmen in the county, including the Zhuokeji chieftain, Suo Guanhuan, and Gong Gao Yangping, the headman of Heishui. If only Su were given a title at this time, then Suo and Gong, who are evenly matched with Su, would not yield to each other. Not only would they not be willing to accept his restraint, but they would also compete for dominance, causing feuds to deepen and disturbances to increase. Although the situation of suppressing the rebellion is currently tense, the province is still peaceful, and it is not easy for the communists to cross the border and use the border people to cause trouble. There is no need to eagerly confer titles on the border people, which would create complications.</p>
<h3>Quzhou Daily Actively Preparing for Publication</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Quzhou, 17th] In order to cooperate with the needs of the [current political situation] and promote cultural undertakings, the Shanghai Reconstruction Publishing House, at the request of Director Tang of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters, has come to Quzhou to establish the Quzhou Daily. It will be published in broadsheet format and is scheduled to be published on August 1. A large amount of printing equipment and a radio station have been brought to Quzhou and are being actively assembled.</p>
<h3>Residents' Representatives in Each District of Changsha Launch Temporary Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Changsha, 19th] Rents in Changsha are calculated in rice. The municipal government's method of reducing rents was vetoed by the Municipal Council and could not be implemented. The temporary method of paying rent at 70% of the original amount has also largely failed to be implemented, and citizens are dissatisfied with this situation. On the 18th, residents' representatives from each district convened a meeting to organize a liaison association and launched a temporary rent reduction movement. They also harshly criticized the Municipal Council and will convene a residents' congress at the necessary time to exercise the right of recall.</p>
<h3>Blood Stains the Huai River</h3>
<p>— Wei Ming</p>
<p>[Wuhu News] The summer sun arrogantly displays its might. The wheat is golden, and the farmers diligently harvest in the wheat fields, their dark faces revealing smiles. Indeed, months of hard work will determine their food and clothing for the second half of the year. However, the communist bandits on the other side of the river also covet these necessities of life. They have no sympathy or pity, especially since they barely managed to escape from Huaibei during the spring offensive and are now eager to launch another "robbery."</p>
<p>Dream of Grabbing Grain</p>
<p>The 34th Brigade of the 12th Column of the Communist East China Field Army was defeated by the elite Qingshen troops from Guangdong during their incursions in Huainan in March and April of this year. Senior communist cadres were either killed or captured, and even Brigade Commander Liao Chengmei went missing. As a result, they had to retreat to their old base in Qingyang for reorganization. However, just over two months later, threatened by food shortages, the communist chieftains pressured the ignorant masses to return to a battlefield with no hope of victory.</p>
<p>Of course, the communists' aim in crossing the river this time was to seize grain. On June 27th, they set out from Qingyang with a regiment's worth of strength. On July 1st, they stealthily crossed the Huai River, taking advantage of our troops being scattered to protect the people harvesting their crops, to launch a surprise attack on a village called Zhouji in Nanshan Riverbank of Dingyuan County, Anhui Province, north of Maba, south of Qianyang Village, also known as Houliang Village. They had determined that we had only a company stationed near Qianhouliang Village, and only four rifles in the self-defense team at the township government more than ten miles away. So, they first eliminated the self-defense team. At the same time, another group of bandits prepared to ambush our reinforcements, while the majority of their forces split into six groups to attack our company led by Commander Chen. The communists were determined to succeed. At about 1:00 AM, they began with a concentrated barrage of dozens of rocket and mortar shells, followed by an all-out assault from all directions. Fortunately, Commander Chen had foreseen this and made preparations. In addition to sending teams during the day to protect and assist with the harvest, he had repaired fortifications overnight and dug communication trenches between each shelter, enough to cope with a sudden attack.</p>
<p>The first to bear the brunt was Squad Leader X's squad on the left flank. Because they came like an overwhelming wave, the entire squad heroically sacrificed themselves in the battle.</p>
<p>As a result, the communist forces gradually approached, heavily besieging Qianhouliang Village, indicating that the bandits had used all their forces. The fighting between the two sides became more intense. First, Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Wei Guiting was wounded, and Commander Chen Shaoxian personally went to command. The fire of hatred burned in the hearts of every man. At this time, more than twenty of our brothers were injured, and most of the company's ammunition was depleted. The sky was still dark, and the bandits fired incendiary bombs with rocket launchers, burning our positions. The flames lit up half the sky, and the moon hid in the layers of clouds as if weeping.</p>
<p>Intense Fire Net</p>
<p>The bandits launched a more fierce attack. However, every inch of advance came at a huge cost. Explosions rumbled continuously, interspersed with painful cries, weaving together a most tragic lament. Our soldiers fought back even more alertly and calmly. Four hours had passed, and the tense emotions made every soldier forget their fatigue. When the bandits launched their fifth attack, the casualties increased. However, they still struggled desperately. The two sides simply fought with hand grenades. Our Platoon Leader Liu Zhengzhong was killed in action, and Platoon Leader Li Jiasheng was wounded. Commander Chen Shaoxian was also gloriously wounded in both hands. However, our fighting will became even more determined. The shameless bandits shouted outside in a contemptuous manner, "Surrender!" Several brothers casually replied, "Okay! Come and get it!" (All answers were in Cantonese). When the bandits approached the bunker, a few loud explosions sent them to their satisfying end. Thus, the remaining bandits, seeing the strength of our position, predicted that the intelligence was inaccurate and there must be more than a company of men.</p>
<p>Just as the morning light dawned, the bandits ultimately failed. So, they made a desperate attempt at a sixth offensive, which was also the final and most violent charge. Our reinforcements arrived from both sides, which was beyond the bandits' expectations. Although the bandits had deployed troops in advance to ambush our reinforcements on the road, Major General Lei Xiumin of our Qingshen troops had predicted the enemy's movements like a god and instructed a battalion sent to reinforce to march on a small road. This allowed them to arrive in time without obstruction and encircle the bandits.</p>
<p>When they realized the danger of being surrounded, it was as if a flying general had descended from the sky. Only then did they flee in panic. However, a spring dream was nothing but empty. The bandits abandoned more than 250 corpses near Qianhouliang Village. We captured more than 30 communist officers and seized a large number of weapons. There were also six bandit boats sunk by us while crossing the river, with no fewer than a hundred people buried in the belly of the fish. In total, in this battle, the communist army suffered another serious blow.</p>
<p>Visiting Major General Lei</p>
<p>The summer breeze brought news of the victory, awakening the spirit of the entire Huainan people. The people of Huainan rejoiced, and gentry, students, merchants, etc., all rushed to comfort the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>After receiving the news of the victory, the reporter immediately ran to the headquarters to visit Major General Lei. He still came out to meet me with his usual amiable and approachable manner. He seemed a bit tired, which showed that while the soldiers at the front lines were fighting hard last night, this diligent general was always strategizing and directing the battle.</p>
<p>Then, Major General Lei objectively analyzed the factors of victory in this battle. He said, "This time, we won with fewer troops because Company Commander Chen was intelligent, brave, and had made preparations early on, and the fortifications were well-built. Secondly, the command was appropriate, and the reinforcements obeyed orders, sneaking in from a small road, catching the enemy by surprise. But the most important determining factor was still the devotion of the officers and soldiers. All the officers and soldiers had unwavering faith and were determined to sacrifice their lives for righteousness. This should be credited to our Chief of Staff and Director Qiu of the Political Work Office." And immediately introduced me to Deputy Clan Leader Li, Chief of Staff Liang, and Director Qiu, all three of whom were very amiable and spoke very politely, especially to their leader - Major General Lei - and their guests. They were so sincere and respectful that it felt like being in a harmonious big family. Talking about Platoon Leader Liu Zhengzhong, who died in this battle, he was from Xingning, Guangdong, and graduated from the 153rd Brigade Sergeant Team. He was usually very kind to people and patiently taught the brothers. In battle, he always led by example, making our brothers have to admire him and follow him more bravely. Who wouldn't be saddened by his sacrifice?</p>
<p>We walked home with joy and light steps. The soft sunset shone on the Huai River, brilliantly reflecting golden light.</p>

<h3>Siamese Twins from Jiangxi Exhibited in England, America, Germany, France, and Other Countries at the Age of Nine with Their Father; Refused Surgery by Doctors in the United States</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Nanchang Dispatch, 16th] Liu Shengjie and Liu Shengdi, the "Siamese twins" from Jiangxi, are strange yet real figures. Both are male, with their ancestral home in Tangjiangwei, Nankang County, Jiangxi, and are currently sixty-two years old. When this reporter was a young elementary school student, I saw them walking down the street in Tangjiang, arms linked. Sometimes, when they disagreed, they would fight each other, and their only weapon was to scratch each other's faces. So, their faces were sometimes injured, with green and purple marks. However, after a while, they would reconcile as before. The only connection between them is a fist-sized lump of flesh in the rib area, which can sometimes stretch to a distance of about an inch, but this is not a common occurrence. After they were born from their mother's womb, their mother tried to separate the twins with thread, but the blood stopped flowing, and they were on the verge of death. At the age of nine, their father took them abroad, where they were exhibited in countries such as England, America, Germany, France, and Italy, and participated in the Panama Exposition, where they received honorable awards and pounds sterling.</p>
<p>In the United States, a doctor once offered a million US dollars for them to undergo surgery for scientific research. However, at that time, a pair of "conjoined male and female wonders" had died due to surgery, which scared them. So, they resolutely refused the American doctor's request.</p>
<p>At the age of nineteen, they returned to China with their father and a translator. During the journey, they learned to speak fluent English, but they could only speak and not write, probably due to the hindrance of being twins and lack of practice.</p>
<p>After returning to China, they went to major cities in the country, such as Beiping, Hankou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. Later, they settled in their hometown, Tangjiangwei. During this prime of their youth, they gambled and worked in their hometown.</p>
<p>Now, their parents have both passed away, and they have two "single" younger brothers who work as farmers.</p>
<p>Regarding their lives - diet, daily life, and marriage - are also strange events of strange people. For example, in terms of diet, as long as one person drinks alcohol, the other will also get drunk. Also, if they drink a large amount of tea, both will urinate a considerable amount at the same time. However, if one person eats, they cannot both be full at the same time. And the hand gestures they use when eating are also different. One uses his natural right hand, while the one on the left uses his left hand in the opposite way. Each uses their left or right hand to support the bowl. When speaking, they can answer each other separately and have no empathy. If one gets sick, both feel unwell and sleep in the same bed. However, taking medicine is not necessarily one dose each. The final hurdle in the future—death—what will happen? Asking them has no answer. If one of them dies from illness, and the other cannot die at the same time, what should be done? So, some people joke: since they were born together, they will also die together and should be in the same coffin.</p>

<h3>Financial Products Stimulated After the Issuance of Large Denomination Customs Gold Units; Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Down, Food and Daily Necessities Skyrocket; Tightening of Credit in the Afternoon Causes Slight Price Decrease</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Central Bank issued large-denomination Customs Gold Units (CGUs) yesterday, including denominations of 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000. The 250,000 CGU notes are still being printed, and their issuance is pending. As of yesterday, the number of large-denomination notes circulating in the market was not large, and they were rarely seen even in banking circles. However, the news of the issuance of large-denomination notes has given considerable stimulation to the financial and commodity markets. In the morning, eight Chinese stocks, including Yong Yarn and Xinhe, hit their limit up. The price of white rice soared by 20%, breaking through the 40 million mark, with the highest retail price reaching 44 million. The prices of other miscellaneous grains also skyrocketed. The yarn and flour markets, due to the Mayor's verbal instructions that the increase should not exceed 3%, were immediately suspended. Looking at the price situation in the market yesterday, prices rose sharply in the morning due to confusion, but fell back in the afternoon due to tight credit. The market interest rate was as high as 75%, but due to the issuance of large-denomination notes, the large discount on commercial paper has disappeared.</p>
<p>The retail prices of daily necessities rose sharply due to panic buying by citizens, averaging about 30% higher than the previous day. Soap rose the most. For example, Huangxiangmao soap rose from 400,000 to 600,000 per bar, an increase of about 50%. The second highest was cigarettes, which rose by about 40%. By evening, there were signs of decline due to the tightening of credit. Qualified persons speculated that the National Bank will sell a large amount of materials and tighten credit in the next few days. Yesterday, the Yarn Control Committee decided to sell 5,000 bales of yarn, ordering Fangjian to temporarily list them for allocation, in order to achieve the effect of cooperation. Half of the high prices in the market yesterday were caused by psychological factors, and prices will fall back within a few days. However, the retail prices of some merchants have deviated from the controlled market prices and are likely to maintain an upward trend.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Skyrocket; White Rice Once Broke the 40 Million Mark</h3>
<p>Due to the issuance of large-denomination notes, the rice market was volatile, and owners took the opportunity to raise prices. In the early market, white rice was as high as 40 million, and Gao thin rice was as high as 41 million, an increase of about 5-6 million yuan. Later, due to the news that the prices of other goods in the industry did not rise much, the market turned soft, and the closing price fell back by 2 million yuan. The closing price of white rice was 38 million, and the closing price of thin rice was 39 million, an increase of about 4 million yuan. However, the market quotations only showed an increase of 1-1.5 million because the authorities limited the increase to 3%. The amount of goods arriving at the north and south markets was only 1,958 shi.</p>
<p>The authorities strictly instructed that flour should not be increased in price due to the issuance of large-denomination notes, causing transactions to be suspended. Midway, the flour mills jointly supplied 7,540 bags of various brands of flour at a price of 11.48 million (including a donation of 20,000), 29 bags per household. Other transactions were not officially opened. Outside the market, the dark price of Lao Che flour reached 13.5 million, and Bingchuan 13 million, but the transactions were very rare, and the later market was also weak. Wheat bran was quoted at 8.5 million. The prices of wheat were not agreed upon by both sides, so there was no opening.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains saw that the issuance of large-denomination notes had become a reality, and the market was very firm. The early market could not be opened at all. The owners of soybeans negotiated prices themselves, with Zha beans at 19 million and Che beans at 20.6 million, and then opened at this price, an increase of 1.5 million. Corn had little inventory and was easy to raise, rising sharply by 20%. Red sorghum and mung beans both rose by 4-5 million, broad beans increased by 2-3 million, Yuan wheat did not trade much, and sesame and peanuts each rose by 5-6 million under the absorption of foreign merchants and the support of the owners.</p>
<p>The authorities ordered that edible oil should not fluctuate excessively and limited the increase to 3%. As a result, transactions were difficult to start. Later, Dayou Oil Factory supplied soybean oil to the street at a limited price of 79 million, but because it was not enough to distribute, it was cancelled. Later, each factory supplied soybean oil at a price of 80 million, with only a small amount available on the market. Zhongzhi Oil Factory supplied Chongqing Jingsheng vegetable oil at a price of 75 million. Jilong raw oil was traded at 100.5 million, and raw vegetable oil at 78 million. Cooked vegetable oil, etc., rose by 5-6 million. Soybean cakes rose sharply at first, once trading at 9.2 million, and then quickly retreated to 8.6 million, an increase of 5-600,000.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Initially High and Then Flat</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market initially rose yesterday and then returned to flat. Jin Sanma of No. 120, at the opening in the morning, shouted a high price of 2.6 billion yuan, and retreated to 2.5 billion yuan to trade. Subsequently, due to the tightening of credit, the market became weak, and the price gradually declined. The spot price at noon fell to 2.33 billion yuan, and the next-day period shouted 2.47 billion yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, the price was 2.44 billion yuan. In the end, due to oversupply, the closing price fell to 2.3 billion yuan, resulting in no increase or decrease compared with the price on Saturday.</p>
<p>The price of factory-made silk yesterday was high at first and then low, and finally was 100 million yuan stronger than last Saturday. Gao scattered lots opened at 2.5 billion yuan in the morning, and spot payment was traded at 2.4 billion yuan. In the afternoon, it fell to 2.35 billion yuan, with a two-day period. Gao scattered lots in the morning had several lots open at 2 billion yuan, and the market also recovered slightly in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday's market fluctuated greatly, and the final result was a slight increase compared to Saturday. The opening price of real silk quilt covers in the morning was around 1.5 billion yuan, with the largest increase to 1.6 billion yuan, and there was a lack of supply. Subsequently, due to the low stock market and the slight recovery of raw materials, the market weakened, and finally fell to 1.4 billion yuan, and then further fell to 1.38 billion yuan in the afternoon. There were no transactions for the checkered crepe de chine, and the asking price was around 4.3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Shows Tightening Trend</h3>
<p>The tea market yesterday continued the high prices of the previous week. After the opening, it appeared in a brisk manner. In the process of issuing large-denomination notes, everything rose. The tea industry also did not want to be outdone, and the asking price went straight to the sky. The trend entered a crazy stage. However, at the end, the situation turned slightly milder. Because credit was unprecedentedly tight and borrowing was difficult, the owners of the goods took the lead in spitting out the goods, showing that they were unable to rise again, but it still rose quite a lot compared to before.</p>
<h3>The Gold Control Bureau Sent Personnel to Strictly Investigate the Huge Amount of Notes of the Banks</h3>
<p>[Our News] After the Central Bank announced the issuance of large-denomination Customs Gold Units, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, in order to prevent speculators from disrupting the financial market, specially sent a large number of personnel to the note exchange in the morning to check the development of large-denomination notes, and immediately questioned the account name and purpose of the notes at any time, in order to prevent them from engaging in speculative activities. At the same time, the Bureau paid close attention to the dynamics of bank deposits and loans.</p>
<h3>Cotton Spinning Industry Dissatisfied with New Policy on Selling Yarn</h3>
<p>The Flower Yarn Cloth Management Committee, in conjunction with Fangjian Company, sold cotton yarn in the market of the Yarn Trade Association yesterday, in order to stabilize the yarn and cloth market in the midst of the issuance of large-denomination notes. This time, the price was clearly set, and the quantity was announced in advance, which was a special feature. On the one hand, Fangjian Company still allocated yarn according to the quotation and allocation method. The person in charge of the Yarn Control Committee once talked with the person in charge of the cotton spinning industry and the person in charge of the cotton trade, asking them to work together to stabilize the market. He also said that the quotation and allocation had always been dissatisfied by the replication industry, and that special corrections would be added. However, Pan Shihao of the replication industry raised his opinion on the spot. (1) The yarn market must enter the market with its entry certificate, and the number of certificate positions is limited, and the factory has not obtained it. (2) In the allocation of yarn in the market, the allocation number of Fangjian is still the basis. The allocation and sale of yarn by Fangjian is unfair and unpopular due to the loss of sorting. It is really inappropriate to be limited to the old rules this time. The Yarn Control Committee expressed its importance to this opinion, but said that there was no solution in the short term. According to Pan, the sales and management methods of yarn and cloth should be thoroughly improved in order to be fair, universal, and benefit the people. In Beijing, he exchanged opinions with President Weng of the Executive Yuan. A few days ago, he also responded to the invitation of Wang Lanseng, the chairman of the Yarn Control Committee, to discuss concrete plans.</p>
<h3>Large Denomination Notes Stimulate Buying; Chinese Stock Market is Encouraged</h3>
<p>Although the Chinese stock market rose fiercely yesterday, it was difficult to sustain it. When the market opened, 11 stocks rose to the limit. Yong Yarn opened at a discount again. The authorities sold materials and tightened credit, and there was a small rebound after the market became brisk. The ending was tired.</p>
<p>In the early morning, stimulated by the large-denomination Customs Gold Units, Yong Yarn, Xinguang, and Huafeng sought to open high to the limit up. After the opening, Yong Yarn carried out discount transactions, with the highest reaching 500 yuan. However, No. 126 and No. 187 supplied at high prices, and the market began to rebound. However, No. 89, No. 213, and No. 154 maintained and repeatedly forced the limit up, but it was difficult to sustain. Credit tightened further, and No. 145 and No. 207 sold for 11,600 yuan, while No. 43, No. 131, No. 89, and No. 129 accepted, rising to 11,810 yuan. Fangjian changed its yarn allocation policy, and hung up the brand several times a day. No. 169 and No. 237 sold for 11,300 yuan, and No. 220 and No. 22 took advantage of the low to absorb, and the noon closing price was 11,400 yuan. Compared with last Saturday, Meilin Lian and Di rose to the limit, Guohuo Xinhua Hengfeng rose by 10%, Yonggong Matches Tongyi Huaxin were flat, Xinyi Jinglun Rongfeng slightly frustrated, and the rest rose slightly to not more than half.</p>
<p>In the later market, Yong Yarn opened at 11,700 yuan, and No. 126 and No. 160, etc., all came out. Miscellaneous brands were surprisingly soft, and immediately retreated to Tunjun 1,200 yuan. Although it was replenished by No. 169, No. 160, and No. 154, etc., and rose to 11,430 yuan, the market was still extremely unstable. Although there was no result in the exchange by the National Bank, it was still forced down by No. 137, No. 180, and so on. After circling, the closing price was 11,250 yuan. Compared with the morning, Meilin Yongye Lanhua was still suspended, Jinglun rose by half, Tongyi rose slightly, and the rest were slightly frustrated. In the off-market, the unlisted stocks were popular because Dasheng Wuzhou and the bank culture stocks rose by half, and the rest were still stable.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous brands turned out to be excellent, but Tong Bing was forced by credit and saw a unique weakness, with a transaction of 2-3 million. Tong Bing opened in the morning at 1.26 million, retreated from 1.28 million to 1.1 million, and then stabilized slightly. Compared with last Saturday, A and B rose by 20,000 yuan, C fell by 30,000 yuan, D rose by 40,000 yuan, and E rose by 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Bank to Establish Special Counters to Recover Small Denomination Notes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to repeated price increases, small denomination banknotes are becoming difficult to circulate due to the inconvenience of transactions. The Issuing Bureau of the National Bank, recognizing the practical need, has been gradually exchanging small denomination notes for larger ones without limit. In addition to setting up counters in the Bureau to handle this, it has also instructed all its branches and entrusted three banks, two bureaus, and one treasury, as well as provincial and local banks, to instruct their respective branches to handle the exchange. Nationwide, there are more than eight hundred units. By the end of last month, more than one-third of the small denomination notes had been recovered. As for the destruction work, in addition to the Central Bank's Supervisory Committee's Auditing Department and the Issuing Bureau sending personnel to supervise, the auditing offices of various provinces and cities also send personnel to jointly handle the matter to ensure seriousness. It is also learned that the standard for exchanging small notes will soon be raised from 2,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>10,000 Bales of Indian Cotton to be Shipped to Shanghai Early Next Month</h3>

<h3>Yarn Control Committee Cooperates with Tightening of Credit - Mass Sales of Cotton Yarn Yesterday - Also Stipulates Temporary Cotton Yarn Distribution Method</h3>
<p>[Our Report] To curb cotton yarn market prices and cooperate with the Central Bank's policy of tightening credit, the Yarn Control Committee has accepted the Bank's entrustment and began mass sales of cotton yarn yesterday. To meet the needs of the mass sales, it has separately stipulated eight articles of the "Temporary Cotton Yarn Distribution Method." According to the implementation, all cotton yarn quotation sales originally held in the market will be temporarily suspended. However, the China Textile Construction Corporation will continue to distribute cotton yarn to the re-manufacturing industry on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays as usual. The Committee's measures were implemented in both markets yesterday, with good results. The full text of the method is recorded below.</p>
<p>Another report: In order to cooperate with the government's policy of selling materials, the Yarn Control Committee originally planned to sell 5,000 bales of cotton yarn and 50,000 bolts of cotton cloth, aiming to contract 10 trillion in currency. However, due to poor acceptance from all parties, the number of sales was limited. A total of more than 2 trillion in currency was contracted. Ninety-six households were approved to purchase 386 bales of cotton yarn, recovering a total amount of 50,004,000,000 yuan. In addition, yesterday, China Textile Construction Corporation, following its usual practice, sold 1,048 bales of cotton yarn, plus 1,527 and one-half bales of 20-count yarn, recovering a total of 1,447 billion in currency.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Initially then Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation: Due to the issuance of large denomination notes, people generally expected prices to rise. Bulls competed to search for yarn, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The market atmosphere was sharp and increasingly constant. Subsequently, after the authorities announced that the yarn price increase could not exceed 3% of Saturday's price, the Yarn Control Committee also announced that users needing various counts of yarn could apply to the Textile Construction Corporation for unlimited distribution. It was also heard that off-market trading was under strict control by the authorities. Furthermore, due to a large number of materials being sold on the market and tight credit, people became timid and buying intentions turned weak. Short-selling pressure was frequently applied, and the market fell.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn initially called for 1.9 billion, and once rose close to the 2 billion mark. However, due to Textile Construction Corporation's selling, it eventually settled at 1.82 billion, up 70 million yuan from Saturday's closing. 21-count Double Horse spot yarn still closed at 1.35 billion, with the next-day price unchanged. Other counts of yarn mostly showed more gains than losses. A total of 45 transactions were made.</p>
<p>Another report: It was heard that the Yarn Control Committee hung a sign in the market, selling 2,207 bales of 20-count Golden City yarn, etc., at prices between 1.29 billion and 1.33 billion. As a result, various parties switched to buying and selling.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Cloth Merchants from Raising Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation: Due to the issuance of large denomination notes, people were confused, but credit in the market remained tight. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 54 million in the market (outside the market, transactions were made at prices as high as 55 million to 60 million).</p>
<p>After 10 o'clock, orders were issued to strictly prohibit unauthorized price increases. The rate of increase should not exceed 3% of the weekend price, and the market was closed early. With the Textile Construction Corporation's bid price for Dragon Head fine cloth at 46.5 million, the supply source was available. People's sentiment suddenly turned weak and tired. Traders successively sought to sell, and finally closed at 53 million yuan, up 5.5 million yuan from Saturday. Five Blessings Trumpet Children's cloth also rose by 5.5 million to 6 million yuan. Other crepe and bleached cloth saw robust trading, and prices also followed, rising by 3 million to 4 million yuan, or even as much as 7 million yuan. Dyed cloth and Shilin cloth were affected by frequent increases in dye prices, and factory prices were slightly increased. Market prices rose again by 4 million to 5 million yuan, with the largest increase being 13.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Temporary Cotton Yarn Distribution Method</h3>
<p>The Yarn Control Committee yesterday stipulated the temporary cotton yarn distribution method as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Temporary cotton yarn distribution will adopt a method of selling at posted prices and fixed quantities. Each time cotton yarn is sold, the count, brand, unit price, and quantity will be publicly posted, allowing customers to request purchases. During the daily cotton yarn market trading hours, the quantity and unit price of each sale can be increased or decreased based on the market supply and demand situation, for one, two, or more postings.</p>
<p>(2) The targets of temporary cotton yarn distribution are limited to re-manufacturing factories and yarn merchants who originally had the qualifications to participate in quotation and approval sales.</p>
<p>(3) If cotton yarns have the same count but different brands, but their market value or quality is similar, they can be grouped together and sold at the same price. The brand of cotton yarn allocated to each customer in the same group will be determined by the distribution agency, and customers are not allowed to choose freely.</p>
<p>(4) Each yarn purchasing customer should obtain blank purchase request forms (format as before) in advance from their respective trade association, pre-fill in the manufacturer's name and the Textile Construction Corporation registration number, affix a seal, and have the trade association stamp it for certification, so that it can be filled out at any time when purchasing yarn in the market, to avoid the procedures of the distribution agency verifying the seal.</p>
<p>(5) After each cotton yarn sale is posted, each customer should fill out the purchase request form that has been processed in advance according to the previous article, indicating the group of cotton yarn requested for purchase and the quantity requested for purchase (which should be in Chinese capital letters, such as "forty-five bales," etc.). Within the specified time, the form should be personally deposited into the designated marking cabinet for that group of cotton yarn in the pre-arranged market. Late submissions will not be accepted. Each customer is limited to one submission of a purchase request for each group of cotton yarn for each posting.</p>
<p>(6) If the total number of cotton yarn for sale in each posting is greater than the number requested for purchase in that posting, all will be allocated according to the number requested for purchase. If it is less than the number requested for purchase in that posting, the distribution agency will consider the situation and take one of the following methods for approval:</p>
<p>1. Temporarily increase the total number of cotton yarn for sale in that group, so that all can be allocated according to the number requested for purchase.</p>
<p>2. Reduce proportionally according to the number requested for purchase.</p>
<p>3. Divide the original total number of cotton yarn for sale in that group equally among each requesting customer, but not exceeding the original number requested for purchase by each customer.</p>
<p>4. Appropriately reduce the number requested for purchase by customers with larger quantities, to the extent that it does not exceed the original total number of cotton yarn for sale in that group.</p>
<p>(7) The purchase approval form for temporary cotton yarn distribution should be collected from the Textile Construction Corporation from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM on the same afternoon. The amount payable should be prepared in the form of a cashier's check and sent to the Central Bank before 12:00 PM the next morning, based on the purchase approval form.</p>
<p>(8) Matters not stipulated in this method will be handled in accordance with past yarn distribution precedents.</p>

In terms of its predecessor, the school was founded in 1927 and has a long history. The senior cadres it has cultivated serve in the national political, economic, news, and cultural circles, occupying important positions. Since being renamed "National," the organization of colleges and departments has also undergone many changes. Currently, there are three colleges: the "College of Law," the "College of Political Economy," and the "College of Liberal Arts." There are ten departments: Law, Political Science, Economics, Land Administration, Diplomacy, Journalism, Education, Chinese Literature, Philosophy, and History. The departments of Diplomacy, Journalism, and Land Administration are particularly distinctive. The career prospects for graduates are even better. Professors such as Chen Shifu, Su Mengwu, Zhao Lanping, Zhang Jinjian, Dan Yinsun, Wang Muzun, Fang Dongmei, Chen Zhongdao, and Tang Huisun are all authorities in the academic world.</p>
<p>This year, the school will recruit 300 freshmen in each department, both male and female. It plans to hold simultaneous entrance examinations in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Wuchang, Chongqing, and Xi'an. The examination dates are July 30 and 31. The Shanghai examination area has set up an office at No. 445, Shanhaiguan Road (at the intersection of Carter Road), and registration is scheduled for July 23 to 26, with examinations on the 30th and 31st. The location is at Yucai Middle School. Most of the school's students can apply for public funding and scholarships. High school graduates who are poor and have the ambition to engage in political work can go to take the examination.</p>

<h3>Exclusive Interview with Schools No. 6 Private Shanghai Law College</h3>
<p>Brief History: The college was founded in October 1926, originally named Shanghai Law University. It established three departments: university, specialized, and preparatory. In the spring of 1928, it added a banking specialty. In the summer of the same year, it moved to its self-built school building on Jiangwan Road. In the autumn of 1929, it suspended the preparatory department in accordance with the University Council's organizational law and established an affiliated middle school. It was also decided to rename it Shanghai Law College from 1930. In the winter of the same year, it was approved by the Ministry of Education for registration. The affiliated middle school was closed in January of the following year. In June, the banking specialty was changed to a commercial specialty, with banking and statistics/accounting groups. When the War of Resistance broke out, the school building was occupied, and classes were started in Wangjiasha. When the Pacific War broke out, it moved to Tunxi, Anhui, and established a branch in Wanxian, eastern Sichuan. After the victory, it moved back to its original site on Jiangwan Road and established a journalism specialty. In the autumn of 1946, the branch was closed, and Fucheng College was established separately. In the autumn of 1947, in order to rectify the departments, the commercial and journalism specialties stopped recruiting new students.</p>
<p>Present Situation: The college currently has five departments: Law, Politics, Economics, Accounting and Statistics, and Banking. The Law Department is divided into three groups: Judicial, Administrative Law, and International Law. In the second semester of 1947, there were 139 faculty and staff members and 1,128 students. The main faculty and staff members are as follows: President and Director of the Banking Department Chu Fengyi, Dean of Academic Affairs Cao Xinhan, Dean of General Affairs Yang Jingji, Dean of Student Affairs Zhu Chun, Director of the Law Department Li Liang, Director of the Economics Department Sun Huairen, Director of the Political Science Department Zhu Wen, Director of the Accounting and Statistics Department and Director of the Commercial Specialty Chu Yifei, and Director of the Journalism Specialty Li Qiusheng.</p>

<h3>World Games Torch Carried by British Ship from Corfu to Italy; Grand Celebration Held in Corfu's Capital</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Corfu Island, 18th] After arriving at Corfu Island from Olympia, the World Games torch was carried by the British ship "Whitesand Bay" from the island to Bari at the southern tip of Italy. There, it was handed over to Italian runners to continue its journey. The torch was carried to the southern end of Corfu Island by a Greek destroyer from the port of Katakolon today. Forty-three Greek runners each ran one kilometer to the capital of Corfu, arriving at the city square. Many Greek officials and well-wishers were present. A runner used the torch to light candles on an altar, and then used those candles to light a new torch, which was carried onto the British ship.

<h3>Third Open Tennis Tournament Scheduled to Begin in Early August; Seven Championship Titles to be Divided Between Men's and Women's Singles and Doubles</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Sports Association's Tennis Committee, the league matches for Group A are scheduled to conclude on August 4th, and those for Group B are scheduled to end on August 11th. To ensure a smooth transition, the Third Open Championship will begin in early August. For ease of management, all matches will be held at a single venue, following the practice of open tournaments in other countries, with a set schedule. It is expected that several championship titles will be decided within two weeks. This season's competition will include men's advanced, intermediate, and beginner singles, men's doubles, women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles, for a total of seven events. The competition regulations will be announced soon. It is planned to complete four groups within two weeks, and the remaining three groups within the following two weeks, with the entire event concluding in early September. Registration is likely to begin within the week.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the high cost of tennis balls, it has been agreed that old balls (i.e., balls that have been used for two or three sets) may be used for beginner and intermediate singles matches. New balls will be provided for the semi-finals and finals. The age limit for participation in beginner singles will be 18 (changed from 20 last year). Those who consider their skills to be excellent may also participate in the intermediate group. The tournament will continue to use the elimination system. After the Open Tournament concludes, a youth tennis evaluation competition may be organized, with no score kept. Judges will observe the various strokes and evaluate the score. This can promote the youth's study of various hitting methods, and progress will be faster. The specific methods will be studied in detail before being determined.</p>
<h3>The World Games Venue: Wembley, The Development of Our Country's Stadium</h3>
<p>[Special Article from This Newspaper] The 14th Olympic World Games will be held in London from July 29th to August 14th. Athletes from 62 countries will show off their skills at Wembley Empire Stadium. King George VI of England will also personally preside over the grand opening ceremony.</p>
<p>25th Anniversary</p>
<p>This year's World Games in Wembley also celebrate the 25th anniversary of the world-famous sports center, the Empire Stadium. Wembley was completed in 1923 at a cost of £750,000, and has a large indoor sports field, as well as a modern outdoor sports field. The following year, the British Empire Exhibition of 1924-25 was held here, with dignitaries and celebrities gathering, making it a grand event.</p>
<p>The Earliest Dog Racing Track</p>
<p>For two years after the close of the conference, no one cared for the stadium. In 1927, the operators planned a renovation and built the earliest and most perfect dog racing track. In 1929, automobile racing was introduced to British audiences. Since then, things have gone smoothly, and Wembley has become the center of British sports, hosting international and major football matches, and the British Football Association's football finals.</p>
<p>In 1934, host Sir Irwin spent 200,000 pounds to build the most complete gymnasium and swimming pool. Thus, in addition to football and track and field, swimming, water polo, boxing, wrestling, ice hockey, bicycle races, indoor track and field, lawn tennis, table tennis, skating and other sports competitions have been staged here. 、</p>
<p>Shelter for Wartime Refugees</p>
<p>The god of war once silenced Wembley for a while, and only dog racing and charity football matches were held in the big sports field. However, before long, Wembley changed its ways and became lively again. The gymnasium was temporarily used as a refugee transit station and shelter, sheltering refugees from France, Belgium, and Gibraltar. Later, it was converted into wartime workers' dormitories and a storage depot for mobile golden house materials.</p>
<p>After the victory, Wembley was transformed again and restored to its pre-war prosperity. Sports fans, after years of spiritual hunger, poured in to enjoy the various competitions here, including dog racing, auto racing, hockey, skating, boxing, table tennis, and more.</p>
<p>Renovation Work Completed</p>
<p>Wembley has completed its renovation work to cope with the first post-war World Games. On the track and field, in addition to the first-class seven-lane track, a special practice track will be built. Other facilities such as hotels, lounges, changing rooms, parking lots, etc., are also available.</p>
<p>The main artery connecting all departments of the conference—the telephone switchboard—will have three seats, prepared to use the fastest and most agile way to deliver the conference news to the various news agencies and the British Broadcasting Corporation at any time, to convey to the world. The transportation of the conference will make full use of radio command.</p>
<p>In short, Wembley and Britain are doing their best to enable the first post-war World Games to achieve the highest goal of connecting the feelings of people of all countries and eliminating the barriers between nations. (Xin)</p>

<h3>Forgetting</h3>
<p>— Shufeng</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese books rarely have indexes or catalogues, so finding materials relies entirely on memory. If you can't remember something at the moment, you have to rummage through boxes and move a lot of books. Often, for a story or an example, you have to spend the whole day digging through piles of books, flipping through this one and that one. Sometimes you find it by chance, but sometimes you search for a long time and still come up empty. Sometimes you clearly remember seeing it in one book, but after searching for a while, you suddenly remember that it was in another book. By the time you find it, you're already dizzy. So, in the past, whenever I had free time, I would find books that could be classified and spend a lot of time compiling a catalogue or index. It was really because I had suffered enough from this kind of pointless frustration that I thought of this "planning ahead" method.</p>
<p>Living in the secular world, one inevitably has to strain one's brain every day. Unfortunately, no one has the ability to remember everything, and there are always some things that one simply can't remember so much, and eventually forget completely. Although the word "forget" is not listed among the seven or eight emotions, everyone has it, and it can be said to be an innate instinct. We are not hermits who live in the mountains and forests, leisurely and carefree, who can ignore the chaotic world altogether. Nor can we disregard all gains and losses, see the human world as a superfluous growth, get rid of all constraints, and become carefree people. All of this is because we still cannot forget the various things in this world.</p>
<p>It is said that when a soul reincarnates into the world, it must first drink some "Meng Po Soup" to forget all the trivial matters of the previous life, so that it can be reborn as a human being. For example, when a person dies, the family members always silently wish the deceased "peaceful rest," meaning to tell the deceased to forget all the hardships and worries of the world and rest peacefully in the afterlife. This kind of saying is certainly absurd and unfounded, but it does have a point in explaining that "forgetting" comes with birth and ends with death.</p>
<p>However, King Fuchai of Wu in ancient times, in order to avenge his father, "had him stand in the courtyard, and whenever he went in or out, he would say to him: 'Fuchai, have you forgotten that the King of Yue killed your father?' Then he would reply: 'No, I dare not forget.'" After three years, he avenged Yue. Unfortunately, Fuchai was still too forgetful. Once he had avenged himself, he became complacent and ignored the honest advice, forgetting that Goujian was enduring hardship and biding his time. As a result, King Wu ultimately lost his reputation and his country. Therefore, the danger of forgetfulness should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Seeking revenge for every trifle is certainly not good, and not dwelling on old grudges is certainly appropriate, but this magnanimity should have a limit. At least one should always be aware of oneself, and not forget everything immediately after suffering a loss, lest one end up raising a tiger and indulging it, causing endless troubles.</p>
<h3>Collapsing Cliff</h3>
<p>— Yiyun</p>
<p>In recent months, I have constantly suffered from strong winds and storms. Recently, the typhoon struck, which made me feel even more threatened. I recall that during the Anti-Japanese War, I initially took refuge in Wanxian, eastern Sichuan, to avoid enemy air raids. I rented a room in a mountain temple. The temple was located on a precipitous cliff, and from the foot of the mountain to the temple, one had to climb more than 700 steep stone steps. Behind the temple was a stone cave that could accommodate more than a hundred people. In the event of an air raid, one could take refuge there. Living in the mountains was quiet, without the noise of the city. Looking into the distance to the big river and looking down over the entire region, I thought it was a paradise. Unexpectedly, in the spring and summer, heavy rain fell often, and the wind was also strong. Lightning flashed like fire, shooting in through the window. In the light, I often saw sparks flying. Then came thunder, as if it were close at hand, deafening. Sometimes the thunder rumbled back and forth, incessantly. I once climbed to the roof, but then it suddenly burst, and the sound was so loud that the roof tiles would sometimes be shaken off. The power of nature was extremely terrifying, but what was even more terrifying was the outbreak of mountain torrents. On all sides, to the left, right, front, and back, the waterfalls on the mountains all poured down, carrying mud, sand, and rocks, like ten thousand horses galloping. Coupled with the strong wind and heavy rain, the sound was even more violent. At that time, a loud noise suddenly arose, like the sky collapsing and the earth shattering. All the mountains shook. When the monks in the temple heard this sound, they would always say to themselves, "I don't know which cliff has collapsed again." The entire territory of Wanxian is mountainous, and the mountains are all stone, high and steep. Building houses against or halfway up the mountains, one must choose places where the mountain stone is complete and not crossed by mountain springs before one can live there. Otherwise, when it rained heavily, the stone would be washed away by the mountain torrents and fall from the top of the mountain, and the house below would be turned into powder. Although the locals knew the terrain and were able to choose solid stones to live near, the mountain stone would gradually decay over time due to rain and wind erosion, and flying disasters could still not be avoided. To the left of the temple where I lived, there was a large temple that had been destroyed twice by falling rocks. Once, a stone as large as a square table crushed the front half of the main hall. Fortunately, it was during the day, and most of the lodgers were out, with only a few injured by falling tiles. The other time, the fallen stone was smaller and destroyed the kitchen, but fortunately it was late at night, and there was no one in the kitchen. A merchant from Hubei built a house under another cliff, but because he did not know the terrain, the entire cliff collapsed during the rain, and the whole family was killed under it. A friend of mine lived near a cliff. One day, during a heavy downpour, he suddenly heard a rumbling behind the house, and gravel hit the wall. He thought to go out and observe, and saw mountain stones continuing to fall, with several large stones wriggling and rolling down the mountain. He immediately shouted for his family to run away. Just as the whole family came out, the boulders crashed through the wall and entered. A farmer built a thatched hut below my temple. One night, during a heavy rain, he heard a loud noise. The next morning, he went down the mountain and saw that the stone steps halfway up the mountain had been destroyed by a huge stone. The stone was as large as a house, making it difficult to walk on the road, but the farmer's thatched hut was unharmed, because it had passed over the roof. It was also quite dangerous. We were often startled and said that falling stones in the mountains were worse than enemy bombs, because enemy air raids had warnings that could be avoided in advance, but this came down suddenly, and there was no time to avoid it. Therefore, people in Wanxian often said, "Crushed by stones," just as we people from Jiangnan say, "Struck by lightning." It can be seen that the disaster of collapsing cliffs has frightened people for a long time.</p>
<h3>Sea Red Mansion Poetry Records</h3>
<p>— Xu Banmeng</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Yimei sent me Huang Yuan's crane feathers and said that the crane was still well, requesting a poem to praise it. Therefore, I composed this and sent it to Mei'an in the summer of Wu Zi.</p>
<p>I always remember the white crane dancing,</p>
<p>Opening its wings and feathers, sweeping away the heat,</p>
<p>Looking forward to Jiugao for a thousand years,</p>
<p>A wild cloud in the sky for eternity.</p>
<p>The frosty feathers on its waist add to the whistling,</p>
<p>How many grey hairs accompany the clear sky,</p>
<p>Knowing that you still have the joy of riding in a carriage,</p>
<p>The dusty coast of Shanghai is rich in food.</p>
<p>A branch of orchid is worried, the jade is lush,</p>
<p>The elegant and secluded fragrance stains the tip of the pen,</p>
<p>Who would believe that the ink turns over, the scales move,</p>
<p>The azure dragon angrily rolls up the cold sea waves.</p>
<p>The past events shine, the dreams of Guangxu and Xuantong are warm,</p>
<p>Clear singing and beautiful dancing, snow leaving traces,</p>
<p>Do not let the crimson building age,</p>
<p>Melt the everlasting soul of Jiangnan.</p>
<h3>Lady Hengbo's Ruby Seal</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Shen of Changshu, of the Rice Studio, is rich in collections: calligraphy, paintings, antiques, and carefully copied rare editions, encompassing everything. The owner, Shen Baoyi, once showed me Gu Hengbo's ruby seal, as large as a child's fist, weighing several ounces, its color as bright red as a rose, radiating precious light. It was stored in a box made of Phoebe zhennan wood, on which was carved a postscript: "Zheng Zhenduo collected this seal for twenty years, and I only obtained a rubbing. Later, I exchanged it with the He family of Daozhou for their ancestors' calligraphy, regretting that I had no chance to see it. Now, Xi Li has come to the capital and showed me this seal. I borrowed it to admire for a few days, because treasures are not always in the same place, and it has changed hands three times in a few years. I write this casually." Xi Li was Fei Nianci, the historian. It is known that this seal was once collected by Pan Boyin of Suzhou, and the He family of Daozhou was a descendant of He Shaoji. Shen obtained it from Zhao Gumou. Baoyi generously gave me a rubbing and asked Master Yang Wuyang to write four poems on it. The third poem says: "The fragrant orchid and water iris are known for their charm, and the jade of the seal is collected after the devastation. The inkstone is made from Taohe stone, a wonderful combination (Shen Shiyou collected the Azure Inkstone, which has a poem by Ma Xianglan). The ruby seal is the seal of the Jiangyun Tower (The Gu family of Yuanhe collected the tooth seal of the Jiangyun Tower, which is as smooth as ruby and is also a treasure of the world)." Hengbo's name was Mei, also known as Meisheng, and her style name was Meisheng. She was Gong Dingzi's concubine and could write ink orchids. After Dingzi surrendered to the Qing, his wife refused to accept the Qing imperial mandate and yielded it to Hengbo. Hengbo later changed her surname to Xu, hence the name Madam Xu. She also came from a brothel, comparable to Madam Liu Rushi. In the late Ming Dynasty, famous courtesans emerged in large numbers, each relying on a prominent official to enhance their status, and the prominent officials used famous courtesans to show their romance. In reality, this only shows that they did not care about national affairs and were addicted to pleasure! How are today's famous courtesans and so-called social butterflies any different?</p>

<p>Earlier, I wrote an article about Peking University alumni, and then I saw an article titled "Old Stories of Peking University" signed by "Jiefu" in this edition. I thought it was a response from a fellow student, but I didn't know who it was. Later, Mr. Xu Xingbai from Ningbo and his wife, Ms. Li Chuqin, came to see me with a letter, and I learned that it was Li, a classmate from the engineering department (Yinwenji, currently working at the Qiantang River Bridge Engineering Office), and Li Chuqin was his daughter, and Mr. Xu was his son-in-law. Both husband and wife work in the Joint Logistics Theater Troupe, stationed in Beiping. They are simple and peaceful, and can be called excellent young people. Jiefu is one of the Cantonese classmates. The letter mentioned Qu Shuji (Guozhu), who was the head of the engineering class mentioned in my alumni notes. He was diligent and honest, and a very interesting person. His nickname "Potato" was well known. After graduation, he has been serving in the engineering field. Before the incident, he was recuperating from stomach problems in the Zhongshan Mausoleum in Nanjing. During the Anti-Japanese War, he traveled to Hefei, Anhui, and was injured by bandits. He escaped to Shanghai with difficulty, experiencing all kinds of hardships and terrors, both physically and mentally exhausted. He eventually died, which is very sad. Chen Zhiji once founded Guangdong National University, and Lu Songfang and Li Boxian served as professors, all Cantonese classmates from Peking University in those years. I still remember once watching a play called "Red Double Jubilee," where the old beggar Jin Song said that Mo Ji was lucky to be just a "scholar." When he came to his house to drink soy milk, what would he use to provide for the "gentlemen from the university"? According to the old lyrics, a scholar would come to drink soy milk, but what if a licentiate came? The imperial examination was abolished at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the clown changed the words accordingly, replacing it with students from the university. Although it was a humorous joke, it was enough to show that the school's prestige was unparalleled at the time. Because the school arose to replace the imperial examination, and "University" was the only university in the entire city at that time, there was no need to add a prefix to distinguish it. Just mentioning university, everyone knew it was our school, just as in the Peking Opera world, mentioning "The Big Boss" meant that everyone knew it was Cheng Changgeng, without needing to add a surname. Also, in the play "Yun Sheng Shop," Wang Mingfang (the scholar who was looking for a place to stay) asked for an upper room. The shopkeeper replied that the upper room (i.e., the special grade room) was for the Cantonese gentlemen to live in, because the old Beijing people knew that Guangdong was known for its wealth, and Cantonese officials in Beijing, such as Ruilin, returned fully loaded. Moreover, the guild halls built by various provinces in Beijing, especially those of Guangdong and various counties, were more magnificent and solid in architecture than those of other provinces. Therefore, the clown made a joke, also revealing a glimpse of people's feelings and customs, all of which is worth remembering.</p>
<h3>Taiyal People</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jibai</p>
<p>In Taipei, Hsinchu, Hualien, Taichung and other places in Taiwan, there are Taiyal indigenous people scattered. Because of their peculiar way of life, people generally regard them as uncivilized. In fact, there are also many intellectuals among the Taiyal people who have moved to the plains. They speak fluent Japanese and write smooth Japanese, and some have become school teachers.</p>
<p>According to statistics, there are 47,503 Taiyal people in Taiwan, second only to the Taiwan Ami people. Their eyes, noses, faces, skin color, and language are very similar to those of Southeast Asians, especially the language, which is very similar to the Malay language of Southeast Asia. It is said that when Japan launched the Pacific War, it conscripted Taiyal people from the mountainous areas of Taiwan to fight in Southeast Asia, and they were able to communicate with the local Malays. Based on this, it is very believable that the Taiyal people originally belonged to the Southeast Asian Malay system.</p>
<p>Their main food is sweet potatoes and millet. Most of them do not have bowls or chopsticks when eating. Men take hunting as entertainment, like watching a play or a movie. When they are about to set off, if they see a bird flying in the same direction as them, they consider it auspicious. If the direction the bird flies in is crosswise to the direction people are going, it is inauspicious. If they hunt a wild animal (such as deer, wild boar, etc.), the head and liver must be offered to the chieftain, a foreleg is given to the discoverer, another foreleg and the internal organs are given to the shooter, the local police and public educators each get a hind leg, and the remaining parts are shared equally by everyone in the village, regardless of whether they participated in the hunting. This practice of equally distributing goods is one of the characteristics of the Taiyal people. If you bring a box of matches and give it to them, you should give them out stick by stick to everyone around you, as they consider this to be fair. Also, land reclamation is done by everyone contributing labor and working together. After the land is reclaimed, everyone enjoys it together. Benefits are shared equally, and people help each other. There are no big landlords, no big tycoons, and no thieves or beggars.</p>
<p>They do not have currency, and they usually barter goods. They do not know what the use of banknotes is. They have no concept of numbers, from one to ten, hundred, thousand, and then ten thousand, and then they cannot explain it.</p>
<p>They are very hospitable. When drinking, two people share one cup and drink together, face to face, to show intimacy. When you step into a native village, you can see many young men and women hugging and kissing in public, or men and women playing the same harmonica. Their social life is extremely free, but they attach great importance to the chastity of men and women. If unmarried men and women engage in adultery, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Taiyal men and women tattooed some patterns on their faces—face tattooing—for beauty. Now, their aesthetic vision has shifted, and this custom no longer exists.</p>
<p>The Taiyal compatriots are hardworking, simple, honest, brave, not humble, not fraudulent, value reputation and know shame. They have many advantages; it's just that compared with people on the plains, their lives seem too simple. (Written in Taipei)</p>
<h3>Old People's Village</h3>
<p>— Huanren</p>
<p>When a person reaches old age, they only have these two paths in front of them: either to sit and wait for death, or to muster their spirits to work, so as to obtain happiness and health in work. In Kent, England, there is an old man named Josiah Alfred. He is a doctor, a lawyer, and a philosopher. He once said a famous quote: "The organization of society is such that only work is the path to health and happiness. Anyone who wants health and happiness, only work." Therefore, when he saw that most of the old people were only walking down this path of melancholy and weakness, waiting for death, he immediately gathered a group of old people and organized a village in a very desolate place called Doddington, so that these old people could re-engage in the work that young people can do. These old people were also people who used to have work, but because of their age, they were rejected by factories or other business institutions. But after they arrived in the village, their ability to work was immediately displayed. They could make bamboo and wood utensils, build walls and pave the ground, and do work such as gardening and farming. They lived in the houses they built themselves and ate the food they grew themselves, but they did not have wages, because they worked for health and happiness. When they finished working, they would sit together outdoors to smoke, sing, and play. They could do whatever they wanted. Their lives were truly spent in happiness and health. Alfred also gave them some pocket money and deposited some money in the bank for them, to be given to them when they left the old people's village. They were free to come and go, without any restrictions. Currently, this desolate and deserted place in Doddington has become a prosperous and happy old people's village.</p>
<h3>Eastern Scale Western Claw</h3>
<p>— Hams</p>
<p>The United States government agencies consume a lot of paper, so the government has set up its own paper mill to supply this paper. The various records and reports consumed more than 25 tons of paper just when investigating the responsibility for the Pearl Harbor incident.</p>
<p>During World War II, a total of 100 U.S. military generals were killed, wounded, or captured.</p>
<p>According to the New York Herald Tribune, the cost of printing a banknote by the U.S. government is seven cents (i.e., 0.07 dollars).</p>
