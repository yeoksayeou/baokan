<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕行政院長翁文灝赴平晋謁總統，請示當前財經改革補充措施，並報告目前經濟局勢及政務，已於廿五日冒惡劣氣候飛返京。翁氏自廿五日晨十時自平起飛，旋接南京機場報告，謂首都氣候不佳，機場不能降落，當即中途在青島降落，十二時十五分抵達青島，下機進午餐後，曾赴市郊巡視，並召見冀市長學遂等垂詢青市經管情況，三時十五分復乘原機飛京，五時四十分於秋雨迷濛中抵達明故宮機場，翁氏下機後，即驅車返瑯琊路私邸休息，晚九時召見財長王雲五，密談一小時半許，王氏始行辭出。翁院長此次赴平晋謁總統結果，對於補救財經改革後之新措施，已有重要決定，本週三政務會議提出討論後，即可公布實施。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕翁院長在平公畢，廿五日晨九時乘追雲號專機離平飛京，傅作義，楚溪春，劉瑤章等俱到機場送行。追雲號起飛十分鐘後，以雷機發生故障，復折回西苑機場，翁氏當於十時十五分換乘「天雄號」南飛，據悉：翁氏過青時，將稍事停留，視察該處經管情形。又清華教授吳景超，劉大中，北大教授蔣碩傑以平事務待理，稍緩數日即赴京。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕翁院長離平前，於機場接見記者稱：華北經濟上所感受之困難，此次北來視察後，已全部瞭解，對華北應獲之供應，政府決予增加，但個人所獲配粉量，則限於六大都市，通例無法增加，目前華北問題甚多，但如軍事，政治，經濟，中央地方各方能力求配合，必可渡過難關，獲取剿匪勝利。記者詢及經濟新措施問題，翁答現正與各部長及各方商酌中，北方大學經濟專家多人，亦特推派代表赴京，供政府諮詢。</p>
<p>〔本報青島廿五日電〕翁文灝廿五日晨十時十五分由平乘專機抵青，下機後，即至迎賓館休息，並劉安祺　學遂同進午餐，連續商談數小時，下午三時仍乘原機飛京。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕據權威方面透露，當局為加強經管工作，對於過去經管機構不統一之現象，正考慮予以統一調整，目前有關經濟?金融管制機構，不下廿餘單位，常有工作重複及各自為政現象，幣制改革後，兩月來經管工作之執行，事實上已證明統一經管機構及加強經管中樞最高指導權之必要。翁院長此次赴平晋謁總統，對統一經管機構亦曾有所請示。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕政府將在京分區檢討經管措施，以求改進，華北區督導員張厲生，廿五日乘　王機飛滬轉京，聞華南區督導員霍寶樹亦將代表宋子文進京報告，張厲生於八月廿五日自京飛平，迄今恰滿二月，以憂心北方經濟，離平時面容已較北來時大為消瘦，張氏臨行以「督導無方，累及地方，衷心慚愧，補過將來」十六字謙告記者。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕翁院長赴平晋謁總統後，對於幣制改革後兩月來財經方面所發生之新問題，如搶購風潮，游資充斥等現象，已決定若干補救之措施，即將提出政務會議通過施行。一般人所最關心之物資逃避，市場無物可購現象，在治本及治標方面，均將採取措施，以謀補救。治本方面為增加生產，政府撥出一部分外匯，購置原料，輸入生產器材，分配於正當廠商，從事生產，在治標方面，則合理調整限價，將限價之不合理部份予以主動調整，俾物資流通，活潑市場。惟經此合理調整以後，限價政策仍必須繼續維持。並為配合此種政策之執行，節約消費將更加認真執行。同時因鑒於過去搶購所促成之物資逃避，限價合理調整，物資活潑以後，對於民生日用必需品，將採取憑證購買制度，以限制購買量，並使一般貧民均有購買機會。同時撥出一部份外匯，輸入若干民生必需品，供應市場需要。與此問題同時解決者為國營及公用事業價格之調整。過去公用?交通事業由國庫貼補，增加發行，今後為緊縮發行，貼補政策勢必應加改變，公用?交通事業調整以後，公教人員待遇及工資亦相對予以調整，俾公務員?工人等得以維持生活。同時，政府為針對共匪高價收買金？銀？外幣，破壞政府新幣制，對於金鈔黑市之取締，將加強執行，查出後除沒收其金鈔外，並予買賣雙方以嚴懲。</p>
<h3 id="c4">解除人為的苦難與不平　平各大教授擬具「為民求命書」　已由胡適呈總統暨政院翁院長 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿五日電〕本市各大學教授朱光潛，鄭華熾，王聿修，賀麟等十七人，為「解除人為的經濟苦難與不平」，特聯名擬具「為民求命書」，該項文件已由胡適呈交總統暨行政院翁院長，原文如次：</p>
<p>「為民請命解除人為的苦難與不平」</p>
<p>這次政府毅然實行財經改革，我們並不認為錯誤，改革的動機，也絕非不當，這個直接影響人民生活的措施，我們也切盼它成功，不容它失敗。</p>
<p>但是成功須有成功的範圍，成功的條件與成功的辦法，如果希望超過了可能的事實，而且缺少必要的條件和辦法，當然無法成功，不可能的事，是不可能的。</p>
<p>物價上漲，雖然主要由於通貨膨脹，但生產減少，物資缺乏，貨幣流通的區域縮小，戰亂不安的心理影響，都同樣可以使物價上漲，當局決定改革幣制，凍結「八？一九」物價的政策時，就應當考慮到這許多因素，就應當明白，即新幣的發行額不比法幣增加，像目前的遍地戰亂，人人都有求生自衛的心理，尤其是北方，正在為生存而掙扎，政府控制的地區縮小，生產減少，物資缺乏，再加上共黨對政府政策的破壞，物價也絕不會停住不動，物價的形成，有種種複雜因素，即在太平年月，物價亦時時有變動，時時尋求自然的平衡。</p>
<p>何況現在，金圓的發行額已較舊法幣增加數倍，照政府公布的數字，「八·一九」前所發行的法幣，約六百萬億，即可全數收回，而政府規定，金圓券的發行最高額是二十億，如果全數發出，就等於新幣流通的數額，要比舊法幣多十倍，政府事前應當知道貨幣的數量增加，而生產未增加，使用的區域未推廣，物價是必然要上漲。現金圓券發行準備監理會九月底的公告，金圓券發行連兌換法幣金鈔等在內，已　　十億，也就是比舊法幣發行額多出五倍，現在又將一月，在這種情形下，如果使物價凍結在八一九不動，人民手中的金圓券就越來越多，物價越顯得便宜，即使不發生搶購現象，漸漸也會使市場上已有的物資售罄，而來源不能繼續，原因是八一九的價格與貨幣的數量失去平衡，也就是已有的物資，按低價便不能吸收這麼多的貨幣，也就是遊資大量增加，而物資數量未加，物價不漲，當然會失去平衡，以致影響到一切人的生活。</p>
<p>至於金圓券的發行，是有十足準備的，這并不能阻止因金圓券增多，而促使物價上漲，因為準備並不兌現，外匯部份的準備，並不能隨時許可金圓券的持有者購買國外物資，在這種情形下，即使有了加倍的準備，亦與金圓券的價值無關，只要金圓券的發行額較八一九時的法幣額增多，便是貨幣又膨脹，這是毫無疑問的。</p>
<p>至於物資為什麼不容易增加，原因很明顯，物價的控制幾乎只限於城市，而城市的食糧與原料，主要是來自鄉村，如果只在城市限價，而對生產原地的鄉村無能為力，這種政策等於自殺，而且因為城市物價低，金圓券便不易流入鄉村，都充溢在城市，於是更顯得幣多貨少。</p>
<p>城市限價兩月的結果，購買食糧和其他日用品，成了一件極艱難的事，尤其是升斗小民，可憐已極，有的披星戴月，排隊等候，已屢見報端。我們要問，是真的糧食缺少了麼？絕不是，這是人為的苦難，現在正值秋收，不應缺糧，而是由於限價糧食不易進城，政治的力量敵不過每個人的經濟行動。我們不能希望每個人都去作貼錢的經濟行為，并且在這秋收季節，政府如不出高價大量購進不可缺少的食糧，今冬和明春的糧荒危險，是可想像到的，尤其是在北方的城市。</p>
<p>除此以外，政府所兌回的金鈔外匯，應拿到國外去購生活必需品運回。按八一九價格配售，因為人民的金鈔外匯，是按八一九的定價換與政府的，這樣能使金圓券回籠，才能增加安定物價的力量。試想，假如金圓券的發行數額只限於用以收回法幣的二億圓，人民手中沒有更多的紙幣，物價絕不會大漲。</p>
<p>但假如政府不能用這種辦法使金圓券回籠，就應使新幣制的成功範圍縮小，即在較大的城市實行。按人口每月配給足以維持最低生活必需品，食糧，布疋，煤，鹽，油，糖，以政府之力量去採購，以八一九的價格配給人民，這樣，一方面維持住金圓券的價值，一方面確可使一般平民受益，因為平民的收入，也只有購買生活必需品，而且政府的施策主要也應是維持多數平民生活的。至於鄉村人民，出售食糧得到高價，可到城市購買其他必需品，政府更應大大增高非必需品等的稅收，來籌這一筆貼補經費，這同時也可有平均財富的作用。</p>
<p>除政府的配給品外，其他一概取消限價，讓人民自由作經濟活動，經濟才可活潑起來，同時亦可吸收一部份游資，非必需品的價格與金圓券亦可尋求自然的經濟平衡，最有效的節約，是公平的配給制度，其他方式都無關痛癢，一部人勤儉遠不及公平配給制的效果大，甚至奢侈品的出售亦不可禁止，經濟活動，才可稅收增多，才可就業人數增多，節約主要在生活必需品，不在奢侈品。</p>
<p>今天限價政策的結果，造成極不公平的現象，幾乎一切物品與勞力都有了黑市，限價只剩下害處，例如公教人員的薪金仍限價，工人的生活指數仍限價，公用事業仍限價，出口結匯仍限價，政府的稅收亦不能作合理的調整，結果公教人員與工人不能生活，出口貿易停頓，火車上擁擠異常，拍電報須排隊等候，原因都是價太低了，只有這些應當合理調整的受到限價，這豈得謂平。</p>
<p>我們認為：（一）金圓券的成功限度，在能按八一九的限價，由政府實行按人口配給主要生活品，（二）由政府加稅，公用事業作合理的加價，　這筆貼補配給的，（三）其他限價一概取消，更無須議價，維持自由市場，使經濟活動，不停滯，而且不影響一般人的基本生活。</p>
<p>除非中國整個局勢好轉，甚至除非世界大局好轉，我國的經濟難望完全走入正軌，現時的經濟停滯，是受國內，國外的整個不安狀況的影響，例如美國，因輸出援外物資過多，物價亦不免於上漲，經濟的逆流，是整個問題的一部份，整個問題未解決，經濟絕不會單獨解決，從這觀點看財經改革，能成功多少算多少，無所謂失敗。毛子水，劉豁軒，劉思職，敦福堂，朱光潛，鄭華熾，李落齊，秦林，王聿修，賀麟，劉崇硡，周連墦，張佛泉，張重一，張起鈞，王雲松，陳友松。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕據美方某人士消息，美政府對我當前經濟情況深為關切，對協助我解決困難及援助之計劃早有準備，惟若干人士有認為：軍事援華較經濟援華更為迫切者。該美方人士並稱：國軍在若干城鎮之撤守，對共匪均無甚利益，因國軍在放棄若干不必固守據點後，反可以周密之部署，進而攻擊共匪。該人士分析我當前政局稱：由於軍事進行之際，實行幣制改革，人民勢必陷於雙重困難中，惟美政府必將作有力之支持。該人士之談話，顯甚樂觀，渠深信在美政府之援助計劃下，共黨決不致顛覆中國。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽廿五日電〕瀋地方人士近日對東北局勢極注意，并有表示。廿四日東北國大代表聯誼會開會，情緒激昂。馬愚忱謂：大家應請當局明白表示對瀋陽的決策，是保衛還是撤退？是保衛則大家一齊出力，與共匪拼下去，千萬不要潮水似的一旦退潮，灘上留些可憐的小蚌殼，任人拾去。結果決議上書蔣總統，挽救東北局勢。並以東北國代聯誼會名義，舉行杜聿明將軍歡迎會，慰問收復遼南各城鎮之劉玉章部，吊祭成仁之鄭迵將軍。對七五事件，希望政府依調查結果，迅予執行處理。廿五日各代表已將保衛大瀋陽方案，請鄧文儀轉呈，并當面陳述東北迫切情勢。鄧氏允即轉陳總統。</p>

<h3 id="c20">幣制改革以後 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 朱培鋐</p>
<p>自從金圓券踏入了我們的社會，物價上漲的情勢較為和緩，這也可說是幣制改革已因政治力量的支持而爭取了順利的開端。不過，政治力量雖可收效一時，若不憑其他措施配合起來以解決經濟方面的各項問題，則今後的演變，殊未許即可樂觀。所謂經濟方面的問題者，仍不外乎下列三大　：（一）如何促使國庫收支平衡？（二）如何促使重要物品的供應不致匱乏？（三）如何促使國際匯兌收支平衡？</p>
<p>這三個問題是具有聯繫性的，政府當局必須立即妥　良策，將這些問題同時着手解決。不過簡捷的對策大可不必尋求，即尋求亦恐徒勞無益。惟有憑藉探討的虛心，堅決的意志，與恒久的毅力，方能於困難的叢林中，開闢一條光明的前程。</p>
<p>首先，我們（一）當討論國際匯兌收支平衡之道。在我國國際匯兌的收支賬目中，自以國際貿易佔着最大數字。關於我國對外貿易的實況，筆者手頭缺乏資料，自未能詳徵博引，但憑日常觀察所及，顯知我國出口物品，無非是些價格低廉的原料品和不敷自用的重要食品，而輸入的除了生產工具，國內匱乏的交通器材，重要原料，食糧，研究性的書籍，無法自製的藥品等項，尚有意義外，大部分都是代價昂貴的非必需品和那可以自製的日常用品。如果這種局面所形成的入超問題不能扭轉的話，則已非經濟方面的問題，而實為局部國民性的嚴重問題了。</p>
<p>扭轉國際貿易入超的辦法，不外乎節制輸入和增加輸出。節制輸入方法，除國內所切需之生產工具，交通器材，重要原料，食糧等項，應該儘可能地允許輸入外，其他輸入品均應管制其輸入量，並嚴禁人民（包括政府官長在內）浪費或作不必要之購存。至於非必需品以及國內可以自製之物品，尤應禁止輸入，並訂定日期，取締市場上之供應。舶來品中之衣料，化妝品，烟酒，和罐頭食物等項，且應分別品類，規定日期，禁止人民繼續消費或使用。鋼琴，短波無线電，小型汽車，游艇，照相機等項，如由私人收藏，即須按期徵收重稅。名貴之鐘錶或自來水筆，電器等類，非有特殊理由，人民不得私自添購或使用。</p>
<p>增加輸出方面，凡不敷自需的重要食品，非必要時，不必勉強搜運出口。而於各種藝術品如刺繡，雕刻，國畫，塑像，陶瓷，紡織，漆器等項，應注意技術之改進及設計之合宜，以增加國外之銷路。礦砂，桐油，以及稀有之物資，均應審察世界上的產量及需要情形，分別訂定有利的售價。他如國內出產獨厚之藥材及果實等，可先由專家分析其所具效用，或再公開其加工程序，以博世人信仰，而後廣泛推薦之於世界各地。至於國內禁止銷售禁止使用以及剩餘之舶來品，均應鼓勵出口事業採集，運往國外銷售，或易取有意義之物資，必要時可由政府設立專門機構，經營該項業務，並接受人民委託，將半新之舶來品拋售於國外市場。</p>
<p>或謂憑這些手段來扭轉國際貿易的入超，可能引起種種不良後果。例如關稅收入的銳減，國際間的反感，國內物價的不易平抑，以及政府必須另　一批執行人員因而增加國庫負担等等。這類警告，自亦不容忽視。但政府當局必須深信事在人為。譬如關稅收入雖會減少某一數字，而人民所增的納稅能力必將數倍於此，只要另闢稅源，何患國庫之收益受損？若論國際方面的反響，只要政府當局以救亡國存的決心來執行這些政策不僅不會召致國際間的無理責難，縱有亦無須顧忌，但若執行不力，或有少數特殊人物暗中破壞，則徒然引起國外的　議，且決無任何效果可期。或謂不問品類性質，放在一般舶來品的輸入可以平抑物價，實為充滿毒素的　論。我國工業基礎薄弱，而國內掌握之外匯又極為有限，如不慎於管制輸入，則必將摧殘國內之工業基礎，並使值得珍視之外匯置　浪用。至於政府當局僱用若干執行人員，亦未必成為增加國庫支出之理由，因目前政府機關中不乏閑餘人力，如將這部人力之效能發揮，豈僅足敷該項執行工作之所需而已？</p>
<p>除舶來品外，外僑於國境內所營企業，亦為走漏外匯之重大因素。對於外僑所營之企業，凡於國民無利者以及不合規定者，均應令其轉業。至於正當之企業，自可與國人所營者承受同等之待遇，但其按期盈餘及收益，無權向我政府易取外匯，且不得私套僑匯，但彼等亦可各自設法向駐華之宗教團體互相劃款，並指定若干次要物資，聽任彼等採運出口。</p>
<p>上述各端，如能由政府至公至誠，切實做致，並佐以適當之外匯牌價，則不僅可以平衡外匯收支，消滅外匯之黑市，甚至可使政府當局掌握鉅額外匯，以充國內經濟建設及穩定重要物品市價之需用。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>次論如何促使重要物品的供應不致匱乏，其原則亦甚平凡，即加強各　物品之生產與運銷，以及防制各種物品之浪費或收　是也。欲避免各項物品之流於浪費，其途有二：</p>
<p>（一）採取定量分配制度，使一般人民可按低廉的代價，購得有限度的生活必需品。</p>
<p>（二）採取「調整一致化」之政策，使各項物品售價按社會中生產力及購買力之消長，作等比例之調整，而不許作　環不息之調整。</p>
<p>二者之中，以前者較為澈底，而以後者較易執行。惟審察目前情勢，此兩方法似可並行不悖，而入手之道，當從採納定量分配制度，最近滬區有實行全面配給之議，固出乎環境之需求。但執行全面配給制度不僅必須使用大量人力，且須掌握巨額物資，恐非目前政府所能永恒維持。不如將實行配給制度分成若干步驟，目前先以公教人員，征屬，勞動階級，以及赤貧戶口為配給之對象；同時享受配給權者必須切實　　幣制改革政策，且屬勤儉建國運動之力行者。各種配給品必須不尚　華，不雜質劣，且以最適當之程序分授與享受者。例如食品類之質地必須統潔，衣料則以國貨為原則，市區中應多設經濟食堂，並將附有配給證之座券分發與勞動階級。政府當局尚宜以配給證來增加掌握中之物資數字，例如：農民若以較多之農產品售與政府，不僅可以收回相當代價，且可獲得較為豐富之配給證。</p>
<p>防制物品囤藏之對策，厥為依法嚴懲囤戶，欲加強各品之運銷，首須顧全運銷者之利益。如欲管制物價，必先管制各種物品在產區之售價。</p>
<p>欲使各種物品產量增加之方法，不外乎解除生產者之困難及保障生產者之利益，並由政府盡力促使各項生產條件之互相配合，茲將重要物品之增產原則約舉如左：（下接第六版）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿五日廣播：安理會為使西方三强獲得充分時間以研究維辛斯基之新建議起見，特將開會時間自下午三時延至五時。緣維辛斯基已自莫斯科接到新訓令，渠於二十四日午夜前以電話召請阿根廷外長勃馬格里亞立刻至蘇聯大使館晤談。美代表傑寶普·英代表賈德幹及法代表巴洛迪於下午三時在美代表團辦事處開始秘密會議，一小時以後決定往晤勃拉馬格里亞於其旅邸。傑賽普於會談完畢告記者謂，「尚有若幹解決希望」。維辛斯將所提出之新建議，主張柏林封鎖逐步解除，同時恢复談判柏林通貨問題。渠反對通貨問題之談判及柏林封鎖之全部解除同時實行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿五日廣播：西方列强已放棄在聯合國中與蘇聯獲致柏林問題解決之一切努力。彼等在連續長時間之秘密會談以後，決定冒蘇聯否決權之危險，將安理會六中立國之折衷方案，立即投票表決。據參加會議之哥倫比亞代表亞培利茲稱，「由於蘇聯態度之强硬，中立國不再作調解之努力。」渠預料蘇聯將否決折衷方案，安理會之最後表決將為九對二，蘇聯及烏克蘭投反對票。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕據接近阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞之人士今日稱，各中立國所提出有關柏林問題之草案，除非發生「奇跡」，始能在安理會舉行表決時阻止蘇聯使用反對該案之否決權。在勃拉馬格里亞仍與西方列强代表會商之時，安理會即將召開。渠在今晨亦會與各方中立國代表會商，據聞渠會將廿四日夜與蘇聯代表維辛斯基會商兩小時經過情形告知中立國代表，維辛斯基業已接奉莫斯科之命令，據同一方面消息謂主要困難之點，係蘇聯欲西方列强決定承認蘇聯馬克為柏林全市之「法幣」一事，能與蘇聯解除柏林封鎖同時實現，而西方列强則仍堅持渠等原來意見，即先行解除封鎖，然後再行談判貨幣問題。又聞英代表係此種態度之熱烈擁護者，而美法兩國則比較採取某種妥協態度，即在四强舉行談判之時，對柏林全市先實行一種貨幣管制辦法。</p>

<p>— 本報記者</p>
<p>〔本報太原廿日訊〕自本月五日起的太原保衛戰，鏖戰已逾半月，據太原綏署副主任楊愛源估計：進攻匪軍傷亡已逾三萬，戰爭情勢緊迫，仍在有增無减。十八日深夜，太原綏署副主任楊愛源及山西省參議會議長王懷明，由幷飛抵北平，謁總統請援，總統允予盡力支持，決再度空運生力軍增援。</p>
<p>空運援軍</p>
<p>堅守太原，中樞早具決心，因爲太原在全國形勢上，其重要性不言可喩。同時三年來完全開工的二十幾個輕重工業，大規模現代化工廠，可製機車，煉鋼鐵，軍火武器和軍民日用品，在今日山河殘破的疆城裏，尤爲國家不可多得的寳貴財產，此次空運援軍與接濟軍品，其惟一保證，則屬於僅餘之城北機塲（在城北十五里）之確保。</p>
<p>匪軍補充</p>
<p>七月間的晋中大會戰，戰鬥十分慘烈，據被俘逃返西安的某軍官稱：匪方自謂楡·太·徐·三縣郊區大常等村會戰，匪卽死傷六萬餘之衆，但匪方以其威脅利誘等毒辣手段，補充很快，僅兩個月時間，又已糾結其所謂華北野戰第一兵團及晋中·太岳·呂梁·晋綏軍區十數萬衆，捲土重來，在徐向前匪首指揮下，煽起了圍攻太原的兇焰</p>
<p>山岳地區</p>
<p>太原在今日已成了被圍的孤城，閻錫山氏跟着就提出了「建立太原戰鬥城」的口號，要向生活生產戰鬥合一方面發展，使軍政經社敎各部門人員及男女市民一體戰鬥化，由確保太原，做到恢復全晋。共匪當不願使此一工作著有成效，故在建立戰鬥城的工作發軌之初，就發動了全力全面的進犯。太原是一盆地，距城十數里之東西兩山岳地區之控制，是太原安全的保障</p>
<p>弧形戰綫</p>
<p>太原的困難原在食糧，夏收未徵及，秋糧亦無可徵。三十餘萬市民和十數萬官兵的食用，除積存外，僅憑空運。今天我們如何扭轉戰局，這是第一要事。太原以城防工事堅固，著稱全國，磚石及水泥鋼筋的高碉·中碉·低碉·伏地碉和火點，遍佈城週，但是，近日的戰事，已經部份滲入了這堅固的防衛綫上，城東北迄城南的弧形戰塲，均在距城十里到二十里棧上，袪除城垣威脅，確保城北機塲，均有待於英勇國軍之消滅此山岳地區弧形戰棧上的匪軍。</p>

<p>（一）任何人民有權向政府當局申請工作以解決生活問題，政府當局應使一切閑餘人力輸入各門生產事業中。而尤其重要的，在生產部門未能容許轉業以前，切勿再製造「人爲的」失業羣衆。</p>
<p>（二）凡可耕之荒地及曠地，必須立卽開墾並儘量使用；政府應擬訂良好之農業計劃，使一切農產品合乎社會之需要。</p>
<p>（三）安定農村秩序，消滅農村中一切不平現象；政府隨時委派淸廉愛民之士，察訪農民疾苦。凡農村中之政治工作者如具優異成績，卽予特殊之獎勵。勤奮逾恒之農作者，亦可獲得减輕稅額及免徵兵役之優待。</p>
<p>（四）工業界之生產工具·原料·動力，以及勞工等問題、政府應當盡力協助解決之。產品之評價必須顧及成本及合法利潤。舶來品之威脅，亦由政府負責抵禦。對於成績優良之廠方，應使獲得貸款·原料·動力等之優先權及較優厚之額度。</p>
<p>（五）國家銀行應以扶植生產事業爲主要業務。貸款計劃應適應多數人民之需要。各行局庫間之責任，必須劃分淸楚，如有餘力亦可兼營其他銀行業務。私營銀行必須以每日存款餘額之若干成轉存中央銀行，或協助某一國家銀行從事生產貸款。商業貸款之擔保品，應以日用必需品爲限；一切擔保品之牧支情形應由各銀行隨時向當地特定機關報吿。如逢某項擔保品之市價暴漲時，政府當局有權按該品於提供保證時之市價收購，而將平價配給與人民。</p>
<p>（六）鞏固各工業區之治安。凡經營生產事業而具優異成績者，政府卽應給予種種獎勵。銀行中定期存戶之利益必須保護，而使游資逐漸流入生產界中。</p>
<p>（七）如逢社會中生產力膨脹時，各項重要物資如棉花·布疋·米麥·紙張·煤炭·鋼鐵等項，亦可購充紙幣凖備。唯收購品之品質必須嚴格規定；各地之收購價格亦應分別核定。</p>
<p>最後討論國庫收支平衡之道。欲求國庫收支之平衡，不外乎開源與節流、開源方面，最基本的措施當然是肅淸稅收機關中之貪汚份子及緊縮稅收機關之開支。如欲增加稅收，首須提高社會中之生產量並禁止奢侈及浪費行爲，以增加民衆之納稅能力。至於另關稅源，應以奢侈品及非必需品爲對象。例如富人之自備汽車，鉅厦，花園，別墅，以及鋼琴，短波無綫電等，均應按期納稅。凡平民化之旅店，食堂，理髮所，照相館等，無須繳納眾稅，但其價格應受嚴格管制，同時不准敷設不必要之設備或消耗奢華之物品。而奢侈性之旅館，餐廳，娛樂塲所，服務塲所等，均可自由規訂價格，且可敷設完美之設備，僱用充份服務人員，存藏豐富之食品，甚至允許消耗有限度之舶來品；但必須繳納較重稅款。各項非必需品如烟酒，呢絨，綢緞，外國茶葉等項，亦宜酌定稅率；其中烟酒稅必須繳納現款，其他各品於納稅時亦可以本貨品按市價折抵。政府對於漏稅亦應防制，例如酒類必須裝瓶出售，茶葉必須裝袋出售，並將編號之納稅印花封於縫口。娛樂塲所之入塲劵，宜由政府統一印置。</p>
<p>茲論節撙國庫之支出，各機關中建築費，營繕費，房地租，交際費，以及交通費等，凡屬不必要者，均應儘量節撙。提高公務員之工作效率，並促使各機關之剩餘人力轉入生產界中，或施以短期訓練而推薦於新設機構。目前國庫之最大負擔厥爲戡亂費用、欲以避免戰事挫折所引起之額外支出，消極方而應設法改善士兵之生活及醫療設備，善用險要，鞏固防禦工程，保持秘密，並多爲征屬謀福利。積極方面應自振頓政治着手。如果政治納上軌道，不僅國民黨可處於不敗地位，內亂亦有早日結束之望。</p>
<p>此次幣制改革計劃，除凍結某一日之物價及疏於扶植生產事業二端確有檢討餘地外，其餘在理論上均屬平穩可行。幣制改革之後不久，政府當局又發動一個勤儉建國運動，誠爲適時之舉。因勤儉運動如具成效，則幣制改革亦必成功。惟欲促使勤儉運動順利展開，首賴黨政要員之率先奉行。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">President of the Executive Yuan Weng Returns to Beijing from Qingdao by Air; New Financial and Economic Measures Have Been Decided; To Be Announced After Discussion at Tomorrow's Executive Yuan Meeting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao went to Beiping to meet with the President, seeking instructions on supplementary measures for the current financial and economic reforms and reporting on the current economic situation and government affairs. He returned to Beijing by air on the 25th despite the adverse weather. Mr. Weng took off from Beiping at 10:00 AM on the 25th. Shortly after, Nanjing Airport reported that the weather in the capital was unfavorable and the airport was unable to land planes. He immediately landed in Qingdao midway. He arrived in Qingdao at 12:15 PM. After disembarking and having lunch, he inspected the suburbs and met with Mayor of Qingdao Ji Xuesui and others to inquire about Qingdao's economic management. At 3:15 PM, he boarded the original plane and flew to Beijing, arriving at Ming Palace Airport at 5:40 PM amidst drizzling rain. After disembarking, Mr. Weng immediately drove back to his private residence on Langya Road to rest. At 9:00 PM in the evening, he met with Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu for a confidential discussion lasting about one and a half hours, after which Mr. Wang left. As a result of President Weng's visit to Beiping to meet with the President, important decisions have been made on new measures to remedy the financial and economic reforms. They will be submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting this Wednesday and then implemented.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] After completing his official duties in Beiping, President Weng left Beiping by special "Zhuiyun" ("Chasing Clouds") plane at 9:00 AM on the 25th to fly to Beijing. Fu Zuoyi, Chu Xichun, Liu Yaozhang, and others went to the airport to see him off. Ten minutes after the "Zhuiyun" plane took off, it returned to Xiyuan Airport due to engine trouble. Mr. Weng then transferred to the "Tianxiong" ("Heavenly Hero") plane at 10:15 AM and flew south. It is reported that Mr. Weng will stop briefly in Qingdao to inspect the local economic management situation. In addition, Tsinghua University professors Wu Jingchao and Liu Dazhong, and Peking University professor Jiang Shuojie, will go to Beijing in a few days to handle matters in Beiping.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Before leaving Beiping, President Weng met with reporters at the airport and said: "I have fully understood the economic difficulties experienced in North China after this visit to the North. The government has decided to increase the supply to North China. However, the amount of flour rationed to individuals will be limited to the six major cities, and it is generally impossible to increase it. There are many problems in North China at present, but if the military, political, and economic sectors, as well as the central and local governments, can coordinate their efforts, we will surely overcome the difficulties and achieve victory in suppressing the bandits." When reporters asked about new economic measures, Weng replied that he was currently consulting with various ministers and parties. Several economic experts from universities in the North have also sent representatives to Beijing to provide government consultation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Qingdao, 25th] Weng Wenhao arrived in Qingdao by special plane at 10:15 AM on the 25th. After disembarking, he went to the Yingbin Hotel to rest and had lunch with Liu Anqi and Ji Xuesui, conducting continuous discussions for several hours. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he boarded the original plane and flew to Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Authorities Strengthen Economic Management; Considering Unified Adjustment of Organizations; Zhang Lisheng Returns South, Huo Baoshu Will Also Go to Beijing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] According to authoritative sources, in order to strengthen economic management, the authorities are considering unifying and adjusting the past phenomenon of uncoordinated economic management organizations. Currently, there are more than twenty economic and financial control organizations, often resulting in duplication of work and independent actions. After the currency reform, the implementation of economic management over the past two months has in fact demonstrated the necessity of unifying economic management organizations and strengthening the supreme guidance of the central economic management. President Weng also sought instructions on the unification of economic management organizations during his visit to Beiping to meet with the President.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] The government will review economic management measures in districts of Beijing to seek improvements. Zhang Lisheng, the supervisor of the North China region, flew to Shanghai and then to Beijing on a [unclear character] Wang plane on the 25th. It is reported that Huo Baoshu, the supervisor of the South China region, will also represent Song Ziwen in going to Beijing to report. Zhang Lisheng flew from Beijing to Beiping on August 25th, which is exactly two months ago. Worried about the northern economy, his face was much thinner when he left Beiping than when he arrived. Before leaving, Mr. Zhang humbly told reporters with sixteen characters, "Ineffective supervision has burdened the local area; I am sincerely ashamed and will make amends in the future."</p>
<h3 id="e3">To Prevent Panic Buying and Diversion of Goods; The Government Will Take Remedial Measures; Maintain Price Controls While Invigorating the Market <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] After President Weng's visit to Beiping to meet with the President, he has decided on several remedial measures for new problems that have arisen in the financial and economic sectors in the two months since the currency reform, such as panic buying and the proliferation of idle capital. These measures will soon be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval and implementation. The issue that most people are concerned about, the diversion of goods and the lack of goods available for purchase in the market, will be addressed with both fundamental and stopgap measures to remedy the situation. The fundamental measure is to increase production. The government will allocate a portion of foreign exchange to purchase raw materials and import production equipment, which will be distributed to legitimate manufacturers for production. The stopgap measure is to rationally adjust price controls, proactively adjusting unreasonable aspects of price controls to facilitate the flow of goods and invigorate the market. However, after this rational adjustment, the price control policy must continue to be maintained. To coordinate the implementation of this policy, the conservation of consumption will be more earnestly implemented. At the same time, in view of the diversion of goods caused by past panic buying, after the rational adjustment of price controls and the invigoration of goods, a coupon purchase system will be adopted for daily necessities to limit purchase quantities and ensure that the general poor have the opportunity to purchase. At the same time, a portion of foreign exchange will be allocated to import certain daily necessities to meet market needs. The adjustment of prices for state-owned and public utilities will be resolved simultaneously with this issue. In the past, public utilities and transportation were subsidized by the national treasury, increasing issuance. In the future, in order to tighten issuance, the subsidy policy will inevitably have to be changed. After the adjustment of public utilities and transportation, the salaries and wages of public servants and teachers will be adjusted accordingly to enable public servants and workers to maintain their livelihoods. At the same time, in response to the Communist bandits' high-priced purchase of gold, silver, and foreign currency to undermine the government's new currency system, the crackdown on the black market for gold notes will be strengthened. In addition to confiscating the gold notes, both buyers and sellers will be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e4">To Alleviate Man-Made Suffering and Injustice; Professors from Major Universities in Beiping Draft a "Petition for the People's Lives"; Submitted by Hu Shi to the President and Executive Yuan President Weng <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] Zhu Guangqian, Zheng Huachi, Wang Yuxiu, He Lin, and seventeen other professors from universities in this city have jointly drafted a "Petition for the People's Lives" to "alleviate man-made economic suffering and injustice." The document has been submitted by Hu Shi to the President and Executive Yuan President Weng. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"A Petition for the People's Lives to Alleviate Man-Made Suffering and Injustice"</p>
<p>We do not believe that the government's resolute implementation of financial and economic reforms this time is a mistake. The motives for the reform are certainly not inappropriate. We sincerely hope that this measure, which directly affects the lives of the people, will succeed and not fail.</p>
<p>However, success must have its scope, its conditions, and its methods. If hopes exceed possible facts, and if necessary conditions and methods are lacking, then of course success is impossible. Impossible things are impossible.</p>
<p>Although rising prices are mainly due to inflation, reduced production, scarcity of goods, shrinking currency circulation areas, and the psychological impact of war and unrest can all cause prices to rise. When the authorities decided to reform the currency system and freeze prices on "August 19," they should have considered these factors. They should have understood that even if the amount of new currency issued did not exceed that of the legal tender, the prices would certainly not remain unchanged, given the current widespread war and the universal desire for survival and self-defense, especially in the North, where people are struggling to survive. The government-controlled area is shrinking, production is decreasing, goods are scarce, and the Communist Party is undermining government policies. The formation of prices is subject to various complex factors. Even in peaceful years, prices change constantly and seek natural equilibrium.</p>
<p>Moreover, the amount of gold yuan issued has increased several times compared to the old legal tender. According to the figures announced by the government, about 600 trillion legal tender issued before "August 19" can be fully recovered. However, the government stipulates that the maximum amount of gold yuan to be issued is 2 billion. If it is fully issued, it is equivalent to the amount of new currency in circulation being ten times greater than that of the old legal tender. The government should have known in advance that prices would inevitably rise if the amount of currency increased while production did not increase and the area of use did not expand. According to the announcement by the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee at the end of September, the issuance of gold yuan, including the exchange of legal tender and gold notes, has already [unclear character] ten billion, which is five times more than the amount of the old legal tender issued. It is now almost January. Under these circumstances, if prices are frozen at August 19, the people will have more and more gold yuan in their hands, and prices will appear to be cheaper. Even if there is no panic buying, the existing goods on the market will gradually be sold out, and the source will not be able to continue. The reason is that the August 19 prices and the amount of currency are out of balance. That is, the existing goods cannot absorb so much currency at low prices, which means that idle capital has increased significantly while the amount of goods has not increased. If prices do not rise, the balance will inevitably be lost, which will affect the lives of everyone.</p>
<p>As for the issuance of gold yuan, it is fully backed by reserves. This cannot prevent the rise in prices caused by the increase in gold yuan, because the reserves are not redeemable. The foreign exchange portion of the reserves cannot allow gold yuan holders to purchase foreign goods at any time. Under these circumstances, even if the reserves are doubled, it is irrelevant to the value of the gold yuan. As long as the amount of gold yuan issued is greater than the amount of legal tender at August 19, the currency is inflated again. This is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>As for why goods are not easily increased, the reason is obvious. Price controls are almost limited to cities, while the food and raw materials of cities mainly come from the countryside. If prices are only controlled in cities, and there is no ability to do anything about the production area of the countryside, this policy is tantamount to suicide. Moreover, because urban prices are low, gold yuan are not easily flowing into the countryside, and they are all flooding the cities, thus making the currency appear more abundant and the goods scarcer.</p>
<p>As a result of two months of price controls in cities, purchasing food and other daily necessities has become an extremely difficult task, especially for the common people, which is extremely pitiful. Some people set out under the stars and moon, waiting in line, which has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. We want to ask, is there really a shortage of food? Absolutely not. This is man-made suffering. Now is the time of the autumn harvest, and there should be no shortage of food. Rather, it is because food at controlled prices is not easy to enter the city, and the power of politics cannot defeat the economic actions of everyone. We cannot expect everyone to engage in money-losing economic behavior. Moreover, if the government does not purchase large quantities of indispensable food at high prices during this autumn harvest season, the danger of food shortages this winter and next spring is imaginable, especially in northern cities.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the gold notes and foreign exchange that the government has redeemed should be taken abroad to purchase essential goods and transported back. They should be rationed at the August 19 price, because the people's gold notes and foreign exchange were exchanged with the government at the August 19 price. This will enable the gold yuan to be withdrawn from circulation and increase the power to stabilize prices. Just imagine, if the amount of gold yuan issued was limited to 200 million yuan used to recover the legal tender, and the people did not have more paper money in their hands, prices would never have risen sharply.</p>
<p>However, if the government cannot use this method to withdraw the gold yuan from circulation, it should reduce the scope of success of the new currency system, that is, implement it in larger cities. Allocate enough food, cloth, coal, salt, oil, and sugar per person per month to maintain the minimum standard of living. The government should purchase these goods and ration them to the people at the August 19 price. In this way, on the one hand, the value of the gold yuan can be maintained, and on the other hand, the general public can benefit, because the income of the common people can only purchase essential goods, and the government's policies should mainly maintain the lives of the majority of the common people. As for the rural people, selling food at high prices can purchase other necessities in the cities. The government should greatly increase the taxes on non-essential goods to raise the funds for this subsidy. This can also have the effect of averaging wealth.</p>
<p>In addition to the government's rations, all other price controls should be abolished, allowing the people to engage in economic activities freely, so that the economy can be invigorated. At the same time, it can also absorb a portion of idle capital. The prices of non-essential goods and the gold yuan can also seek a natural economic balance. The most effective conservation is a fair rationing system. Other methods are irrelevant. The diligence and frugality of a few people is far less effective than a fair rationing system. Even the sale of luxury goods should not be prohibited, so that economic activities can increase tax revenue and the number of people employed can increase. Conservation is mainly about essential goods, not luxury goods.</p>
<p>Today, the result of the price control policy has created extremely unfair phenomena. Almost all goods and labor have a black market. Price controls only have disadvantages left. For example, the salaries of public servants and teachers are still price-controlled, the cost of living index for workers is still price-controlled, public utilities are still price-controlled, export settlements are still price-controlled, and the government's tax revenue cannot be reasonably adjusted. As a result, public servants and workers cannot live, export trade is stagnant, trains are extremely crowded, and telegrams must be queued for. The reason is that the price is too low. Only those that should be reasonably adjusted are subject to price controls. How can this be said to be fair?</p>
<p>We believe that: (1) The limit of success for the gold yuan is that the government can implement rationing of main essential goods per capita at the August 19 controlled price; (2) The government increases taxes and public utilities reasonably increase prices to [unclear character] subsidize the rations; (3) All other price controls are abolished, and there is no need to negotiate prices. Maintain a free market, so that economic activity does not stagnate and does not affect the basic life of the general public.</p>
<p>Unless the entire situation in China improves, or even unless the entire world situation improves, it is difficult to expect our country's economy to fully get back on track. The current economic stagnation is affected by the entire unstable situation at home and abroad. For example, in the United States, prices are inevitably rising due to excessive exports of foreign aid materials. The economic downturn is part of the whole problem. The economy will never be solved separately unless the whole problem is solved. From this point of view, financial and economic reforms can succeed as much as possible, and there is no such thing as failure.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] According to a US source, the US government is deeply concerned about China's current economic situation, and has long been prepared to assist us in solving difficulties and providing aid. However, some people believe that military aid to China is more urgent than economic aid. The US source also stated that the withdrawal of the National Army from some towns and cities is of little benefit to the Communist bandits, because after the National Army abandons some strongholds that do not need to be defended, it can make meticulous deployments and attack the Communist bandits. Analyzing the current political situation in China, the source said that due to the implementation of currency reform during military operations, the people will inevitably fall into double difficulties, but the US government will provide strong support. The US source's remarks were very optimistic, and he deeply believed that with the US government's aid plan, the Communist Party would not overthrow China.</p>

Ma Yuchen said: "Everyone should ask the authorities to clearly express their decision on Shenyang: whether to defend it or retreat? If we defend it, everyone should contribute together and fight the Communist bandits to the end. Don't let the tide recede once and leave some poor little shellfish on the beach for others to pick up." As a result, it was decided to submit a letter to President Chiang to save the situation in the Northeast. The Northeast National Assembly Representatives' Association will also hold a welcome party for General Du Yuming to express condolences to General Liu Yuzhang's troops who recovered the towns and cities in southern Liaoning, and to pay tribute to General Zheng Tong, who died in action. Regarding the "July 5th" incident, they hope that the government will promptly implement the handling of the matter based on the results of the investigation. On the 25th, the representatives submitted the plan to defend Greater Shenyang to Deng Wenyi for transmission to the President, and personally stated the urgent situation in the Northeast.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi told reporters today about the military situation in the North, saying: "In the Guankou battle in the eastern section of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway, the two sides used about 100,000 troops. If we had pursued in time, the results would have been even greater. Unfortunately, the National Army there fought hard for three days and nights without eating. They were too exhausted, which prevented them from obtaining all the fruits of victory. Because the military depends on the results, I am unwilling to make any predictions about the Suiyuan-Baotou battle. The Suiyuan Relief Advance Corps is actively advancing, and Deputy Commanders-in-Chief Deng Baoshan and Feng Qinzai are also beginning to 'compete' with the bandits in western Suiyuan." Mr. Fu also emphasized two points: First, terrain and all other conditions are secondary determinants. The most important condition for war is "fighting"; second, the National Army in North China has reached the point of actively finding the enemy to fight.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guihua, 25th] After the Suiyuan National Army took the initiative to withdraw from Baotou, the deployment for a large-scale annihilation battle has been completed.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Wuyuan, 25th] When the Baotou garrison received orders to move to western Suiyuan at 4:00 AM on the 23rd, this reporter climbed onto a military vehicle to leave the city. Many public servants and citizens were still asleep. When we arrived at Haye Hutong, 60 kilometers from Baotou, we learned that four columns of bandit troops had arrived at the periphery of Baotou. The Yulin relief army was blocked north of Suotengke Banner and south of Dongsheng. Therefore, the military temporarily took this decisive measure. According to refugees who fled to Gongmiaozi on the night of the 23rd, as of 1:00 PM, the bandit army had not yet entered the city, and only the poor were looting the materials of military and government agencies. Military academies have all reached safe areas. We departed from Gongmiaozi on the 24th. When we passed through Anbei, the stores were closed and the streets were full of wartime scenes. The telephone in Haye Hutong was out of service, and the situation nearby was unknown. General Deng Baoshan is receiving troops in a certain place in front. Tian Shumei, the military supervisor of western Suiyuan, and Wang [unclear character], Li Junfeng, a senator from Wuyuan, drove to visit him and provide opinions on defending Hetao. We entered Wuyuan in the evening, and the order was still considered stable. Relevant parties confirmed that 4,000 bandit cavalry entered Baotou at 3:00 PM yesterday. The situation in Yulin is chaotic, and the Ningxia Corps may arrive at the westernmost front line of Hetao, Xishan Mouth, within a few days.</p>

<h3 id="e20">After the Currency Reform <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Peiheng</p>
<p>Since the Gold Yuan Note entered our society, the situation of price increases has eased somewhat, which can be said that the currency reform has won a smooth start with the support of political power. However, although political power can be effective for a while, if it is not combined with other measures to solve various economic problems, then the future evolution is by no means optimistic. The so-called economic problems are still nothing more than the following three: (1) How to promote a balance between national treasury revenue and expenditure? (2) How to ensure that the supply of important items is not scarce? (3) How to promote a balance in international exchange revenue and expenditure?</p>
<p>These three problems are interconnected, and the government authorities must immediately devise appropriate strategies to solve these problems simultaneously. However, simple solutions should not be sought, and seeking them may be futile. Only with an exploring humility, a firm will, and lasting perseverance can one open up a bright future in the jungle of difficulties.</p>
<p>First, we (1) should discuss the way to balance international exchange revenue and expenditure. In our country's international exchange balance sheet, international trade accounts for the largest number. Regarding the actual situation of our country's foreign trade, the author lacks data on hand, so I cannot cite extensively, but based on daily observations, it is clear that our export items are nothing more than cheap raw materials and important foods that are insufficient for our own use, and the imports, in addition to production tools, scarce domestic transportation equipment, important raw materials, food, research books, medicines that cannot be manufactured domestically, etc., are still meaningful, but most of them are expensive non-essential goods and daily necessities that can be manufactured domestically. If the trade deficit formed by this situation cannot be reversed, then it is no longer an economic problem, but a serious problem of local national character.</p>
<p>The method of reversing the international trade deficit is nothing more than restricting imports and increasing exports. The method of restricting imports, in addition to the production tools, transportation equipment, important raw materials, food, etc. that are urgently needed domestically, should be allowed to be imported as much as possible, and the import volume of other imported goods should be controlled, and people (including government officials) should be strictly prohibited from wasting or making unnecessary purchases. As for non-essential goods and items that can be manufactured domestically, imports should be prohibited, and a date should be set to ban their supply on the market. Imported clothing, cosmetics, tobacco, alcohol, and canned foods, etc., should be classified separately, and a date should be set to prohibit people from continuing to consume or use them. Pianos, shortwave radios, small cars, yachts, cameras, etc., if owned by private individuals, must be subject to heavy taxes on a regular basis. Expensive watches or fountain pens, electrical appliances, etc., people shall not privately purchase or use them without special reasons.</p>
<p>In terms of increasing exports, important foods that are insufficient for our own needs should not be forced to be searched and transported for export unless necessary. For various artworks such as embroidery, carvings, traditional Chinese paintings, sculptures, ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, etc., attention should be paid to the improvement of technology and the suitability of design to increase sales abroad. Mineral sands, tung oil, and rare materials should be examined for their production and needs in the world, and favorable selling prices should be set separately. For medicinal materials and fruits, etc., which are uniquely produced domestically, experts can first analyze their effects, or publicly disclose their processing procedures, to win the trust of the world, and then widely recommend them to various parts of the world. As for domestically prohibited sales, prohibited use, and surplus imported goods, export businesses should be encouraged to collect them, transport them to foreign countries for sale, or exchange them for meaningful materials. When necessary, the government can set up a specialized agency to operate this business and accept public commissions to sell semi-new imported goods in foreign markets.</p>
<p>Some say that using these means to reverse the international trade deficit may cause various adverse consequences. For example, a sharp decrease in tariff revenue, international resentment, difficulty in suppressing domestic prices, and the government having to find another batch of enforcement personnel, thereby increasing the burden on the national treasury, etc. This type of warning should not be ignored. However, the government authorities must firmly believe that things are done by people. For example, although tariff revenue will decrease by a certain number, the taxpaying ability of the people will inevitably increase several times. As long as new tax sources are opened up, why worry about the loss of national treasury revenue? Regarding the international reaction, as long as the government authorities implement these policies with the determination to save the country and survive, not only will it not cause unreasonable criticism from the international community, but there is no need to worry even if there is. However, if the implementation is not strong, or a few special figures secretly sabotage it, it will only cause foreign discussion, and no effect can be expected. Some say that regardless of the nature of the product, putting the import of general imported goods can suppress prices, which is a theory full of toxins. Our country's industrial base is weak, and the foreign exchange in the hands of the country is extremely limited. If we are not careful in controlling imports, it will inevitably destroy the domestic industrial base and waste the valuable foreign exchange. As for the government authorities employing some enforcement personnel, it may not necessarily become a reason for increasing national treasury expenditure, because there is no shortage of idle manpower in the current government agencies. If the effectiveness of this part of the manpower is brought into play, wouldn't it be enough to meet the needs of this enforcement work?</p>
<p>In addition to imported goods, foreign-owned enterprises within the national border are also a major factor in the leakage of foreign exchange. For foreign-owned enterprises, those that are not beneficial to the nation and do not comply with regulations should be ordered to change industries. As for legitimate enterprises, they can be treated equally with those operated by Chinese people, but they have no right to exchange foreign exchange with our government for their periodic profits and income, and they must not privately exchange remittances from overseas Chinese. However, they can also find ways to transfer funds to religious organizations in China and designate some minor materials to be transported for export.</p>
<p>If the above points can be implemented by the government with utmost fairness and sincerity, and supplemented with appropriate foreign exchange rates, then not only can the foreign exchange balance be balanced and the black market for foreign exchange be eliminated, but even the government authorities can control huge amounts of foreign exchange to meet the needs of domestic economic construction and stabilize the market prices of important items.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Next, let's discuss how to promote the supply of important items from becoming scarce. The principle is also very ordinary, that is, to strengthen the production and marketing of various items, and to prevent the waste or hoarding of various items. There are two ways to avoid the waste of various items:</p>
<p>(1) Adopt a quantitative distribution system so that the general public can purchase limited necessities of life at low prices.</p>
<p>(2) Adopt a "consistent adjustment" policy so that the prices of various items are adjusted in equal proportions according to the rise and fall of productivity and purchasing power in society, and no cyclical adjustments are allowed.</p>
<p>Among the two, the former is more thorough, and the latter is easier to implement. However, examining the current situation, these two methods can be implemented simultaneously, and the way to start should be to adopt a quantitative distribution system. Recently, there has been a proposal to implement comprehensive rationing in the Shanghai area, which is based on the needs of the environment. However, the implementation of a comprehensive rationing system not only requires the use of a large amount of manpower, but also requires the control of huge amounts of materials, which may not be sustainable for the current government. It is better to divide the implementation of the rationing system into several steps. At present, government employees, military dependents, the working class, and the extremely poor should be the targets of rationing; at the same time, those who enjoy rationing rights must earnestly support the currency reform policy and be practitioners of the diligent and frugal nation-building movement. Various rationed goods must not be luxurious, not be mixed with inferior quality, and be distributed to the beneficiaries in the most appropriate procedure. For example, the quality of food must be uniform and clean, and clothing should be based on domestic products in principle. More economic cafeterias should be set up in urban areas, and seating tickets with ration coupons should be distributed to the working class. The government authorities should also use ration coupons to increase the number of materials under their control. For example, if farmers sell more agricultural products to the government, they can not only recover considerable compensation, but also obtain richer ration coupons.</p>
<p>The countermeasure to prevent the hoarding of goods is to severely punish hoarders according to law. To strengthen the marketing of various products, we must first take care of the interests of marketers. If we want to control prices, we must first control the selling price of various items in the production area.</p>
<p>The way to increase the output of various items is nothing more than to relieve the difficulties of producers and protect the interests of producers, and the government should do its best to promote the mutual coordination of various production conditions. The principles of increasing the production of important items are summarized as follows: (Continued on page six)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] The sensational case of Zan Chen's wife, Lun Qianru, privately operating a huge gold certificate business, began hearing on the 25th by the Special Criminal Court. The primary defendant, Lun Qianru, admitted to using 36,360 US dollars, through the introduction of a German named Wei Er, to purchase 120 gold bars from a German named Maier, but claimed never to have seen Maier. She ultimately argued that she intended to report the crime to the authorities in order to receive a reward, as a friend surnamed Jiang had secretly arranged with her in May to buy gold with US dollars, intending to report this for the reward. Wei Er testified that he was introduced to Lun Qianru by Jiang Bingyu. He claimed that a German named Maier stated that a Russian named Lavarov wanted to sell 240 gold bars, but had no buyer. Wei Er then sought a buyer from Lun Qianru and sold 120 bars, earning a commission of 15 bars. Lun's defense lawyer, an elderly attorney, argued that the gold seller had not appeared from beginning to end, suggesting that selling gold may have been a means to defraud US dollars and then make an arrest. He emphasized that the investigation should focus on finding the gold seller, and that mere verification of funds did not constitute a gold transaction. Wei Er's lawyer, Attorney Guo, argued that the incident occurred before August 19th and should be handled by the local court, arguing that the Special Criminal Court should not have jurisdiction. The court ultimately ruled that the case would be continued for a future hearing.</p>

He immediately dispatched police to board the ship for a second inspection, uncovering a large quantity of arms, including seventy American-made Thompson submachine guns, thirty carbines, and ten thousand rounds of ammunition. However, no one on the scene claimed ownership of the arms, which were all confiscated immediately. It is reported that a principal offender, an overseas Chinese visitor, was arrested by the water police. At noon, the garrison and military police stationed in Xiamen, upon learning of the incident, all dispatched teams to board the ship. The location where the seized arms will be stored remains undecided as of this evening. This seizure is the largest arms smuggling case this year, and there are two more packages of luggage that may also contain arms, potentially bringing the total to two hundred guns.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Compromise Solution to the Berlin Problem: Security Council Submits to Vote; Soviet Envoy Arrives in Paris with a Strong Stance: Advocates Gradual Lifting of Blockade While Simultaneously Negotiating Currency Issue <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: The Security Council, to give the Western powers ample time to study Vyshinsky's new proposal, postponed the meeting time from 3 pm to 5 pm. Vyshinsky had received new instructions from Moscow. Before midnight on the 24th, he summoned Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia by telephone to meet at the Soviet embassy. US Representative Jessup, British Representative Jebb, and French Representative Parodi began a secret meeting at the US delegation office at 3 pm. An hour later, they decided to visit Bramuglia at his residence. After the meeting, Jessup told reporters, "There is still some hope of a solution." Vyshinsky's new proposal advocates a gradual lifting of the Berlin blockade while simultaneously resuming negotiations on the Berlin currency issue. He opposes the negotiation of the currency issue and the complete lifting of the Berlin blockade occurring simultaneously.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: The Western powers have abandoned all efforts to reach a resolution on the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union in the United Nations. After lengthy secret talks, they decided to risk a Soviet veto and immediately vote on the compromise proposal of the six neutral nations of the Security Council. According to Colombian representative Echeverri, who participated in the meeting, "Due to the strong stance of the Soviet Union, the neutral countries are no longer making efforts to mediate." He predicted that the Soviet Union would veto the compromise proposal, and the final vote in the Security Council would be nine to two, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine voting against.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] According to people close to Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia today, the draft proposed by the neutral countries regarding the Berlin issue, unless a "miracle" occurs, will not be able to prevent the Soviet Union from using its veto power against the proposal when the Security Council votes. The Security Council is about to convene while Bramuglia continues to confer with representatives of the Western powers. This morning, he also met with representatives of various neutral countries, reportedly informing them of his two-hour consultation with Soviet representative Vyshinsky on the night of the 24th. Vyshinsky has received orders from Moscow. According to the same source, the main difficulty is that the Soviet Union wants the Western powers to agree to recognize the Soviet mark as the "legal tender" for the entire city of Berlin simultaneously with the Soviet Union lifting the Berlin blockade, while the Western powers still insist on their original view that the blockade should be lifted first, and then currency issues should be negotiated. It is also reported that the British representative is a fervent supporter of this position, while the United States and France are taking a more compromising attitude, that is, implementing a currency control measure for the entire city of Berlin while the four powers are holding negotiations.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The Egyptian representative notified the Security Council today that the Jewish army in Palestine is unwilling to abide by the Security Council's ceasefire order and continues to violate the truce, appealing to the Security Council to pay attention to this matter. To this end, the United Nations Secretariat officially announced today that the Security Council will convene on the morning of the 26th to study the issue of truce violations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] US domestic politics once again caused confusion over the Palestinian issue in the United Nations on the 25th, threatening the early demise of Bernadotte's plan to partition the Holy Land. While the US representatives here believed that the plan had been shelved before the election, a dispute over Holy Land policy unfolded between Truman and Dewey. Some United Nations representatives believe that Dewey's recent proclamation contradicted the policies outlined by the US delegation at the beginning of the General Assembly. Days before the General Assembly convened, Marshall announced that the United States supported the Bernadotte plan as the basis for resolving the Palestinian issue, but as soon as Truman's statement was published, the Israeli representatives, who had consistently opposed the Bernadotte plan behind the scenes at the General Assembly, were overjoyed. One Israeli statement read, "The official US policy opposes any change to Israel's borders without Israel's consent, which is extremely important." This statement fully indicates that the Israeli delegation to the General Assembly believes that US policy has changed from supporting the Bernadotte plan to opposing it. The main reason Israel opposes the plan is that Bernadotte advocates that Israel relinquish the vast Negev area in exchange for Western Galilee. The Arab side also vowed to oppose it to the death, as the plan stipulates the recognition of the State of Israel and its right to exist. Many General Assembly representatives were surprised when the US State Department announced that Truman's statement supporting the old partition plan and Marshall's policies were not in conflict. They want to know whether the United States will support the Bernadotte plan next week or back down and not endorse it.</p>

<p>[This newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: The meeting of the foreign ministers of the five Western European Union powers opened on the 25th at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. French Foreign Minister Schuman was elected as chairman. The issue of the United States and Canada joining the military alliance was included in the agenda. According to authoritative British and American sources, the main issue of this meeting will be the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty between the Western European Union and the American powers. British officials stated that, in view of the confidentiality of this meeting, they decided to impose further restrictions on the disclosure of information about future meetings, and to issue a communiqué at the end of the meeting. According to informed sources, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will conditionally support the proposal of France and Belgium for a Western European Parliament. This international parliament will be composed of representatives selected from the parliaments of the five countries and will have deliberative powers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 25th] The New York Herald Tribune commented today in an editorial on the rumor that the United States might participate in an Atlantic alliance including the five signatory countries of Brussels and Canada, stating that it would be impossible to achieve this in the final days before the presidential election, but that if any steps were taken in this regard, it would be the most serious and difficult task for the new government. The report continued, stating that if the rumored Atlantic alliance is true, then the significance of this matter has exceeded the scope of the Vandenberg Resolution. The suggestion is that the United States can only maintain cooperation with foreign regional agreements. The article solemnly pointed out that Americans cannot ignore the significance of this step, as the United States will be responsible for supplying materials for the rearmament of Western Europe, which places another responsibility on the United States in addition to the Marshall Plan and the atomic energy program. The newspaper concluded that, if so, the Atlantic alliance will become an alliance challenging other countries.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] The US Navy Department revealed today that it has completed the aircraft plan for the fleet in the "atomic age". According to US Navy Vice Admiral Miller, the plan includes four points: (1) building aircraft carriers capable of carrying the fastest large naval aircraft newly built after the war; (2) building extremely fast submarines that can operate in the deepest oceans; (3) building extremely fast combat submarines that can potentially penetrate deep into the sea; (4) building special ships for surveying the Arctic. He also stated that the atomic age fleet naturally includes 65,000-ton aircraft carriers, which can allow four bombers carrying atomic bombs to take off simultaneously. The two aircraft carriers "Essex" and "Wasp" from the last war will be modernized to enable them to carry modern aircraft. Subsequently, other aircraft carriers will also be similarly "modernized". The plan for the new submarine fleet includes: (1) building six extremely fast submarines; (2) building transport submarines to supply provisions to troops in transit; (3) building oil tankers to supply gasoline to submarines; (4) two cruisers; (5) four torpedo boats; (6) and three submarines to combat submarines from other countries.</p>

<p>[United Press, Beirut, 25th] Tensions between the United Kingdom and Arab countries have existed for some time. There are constant rumors that at least four Arab countries intend to sign an agreement with the United Kingdom. Both sides are reportedly doing so out of fear of the outbreak of a third world war. Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are expected to reach an agreement with the United Kingdom. Some people in Arab capitals say that, in fact, Arab representatives have already begun negotiations with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and other senior foreign officials in Paris. However, the Arab governments have made no official statement on this matter. Although the Arab side opposes the British policy on Palestine, it is still consulting with British leaders and listening to Bevin's report on the global situation. British and American military experts believe that the Middle East is a must-contend place in the next war. The Soviet Union has been coveting it for a long time, which has become an open secret. British and American experts also firmly believe that the Middle East should be defended from Soviet offensives. Therefore, if a regional defense agreement can be negotiated with the Arab countries first, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] At 4 am on the 25th, 100,000 French military police began operations in an area of 45 kilometers in the northern provinces of Nord and Pas-de-Calais, near Belgium, to take over the mines currently occupied by striking workers. This operation was planned by Interior Minister Moch and decided after consultation with military officers. Before the launch, extreme secrecy was maintained. After the plan was decided, an order was issued to Police Commissioner Villié of the capital of Nord Province to execute it.

At the same time, in the coalfields of Douai and Valenciennes, the main targets of this operation against striking workers, the military police implemented a so-called security cordon to prevent unforeseen events. As of 11 am this morning, there were no reports of any conflicts, and the military police had already occupied several important mining areas. It is also reported that textile and metal workers in the Valenciennes area who sympathize with the miners have also begun to strike.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 24th] The Korean government confirmed this morning that it has completely recovered Suncheon, the rebel stronghold, but admitted that Jangheung, a city along the railway line 39 nautical miles southwest of Suncheon, has fallen. There is no new information about Yeosu, and the previous reports of its recovery have not been confirmed. The rebels, under the powerful pincer offensive of the government, have abandoned Suncheon and advanced westward, successively capturing the towns of Boseong and Jangheung along the railway line, which proves that they intend to gain a foothold in the extreme southwest corner of South Korea.

<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 24th] The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Communist Party jointly issued an important order today to systematically establish vast forest shelter belts across the Russian steppe region of Europe to resist periodic droughts. The afforestation plan will be completed within fifteen years, and covers areas from the east of the Dniester River to the Ural Mountains, from south of Moscow to the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea. The plan includes the establishment of eight major state-owned forest belts, with a total length of more than 3,300 miles, to protect agricultural land north of the Volga River and north of the Caucasus from erosion by hot, dry air currents from the deserts of Central Asia. North-south forest belts, each approximately one mile wide, will be planted along the banks of the Ural River, the Volga River, and the Don River, and from Stalingrad to Cherkassk, from Chapaevsk to Vladivirovka, and from Penza to Kamensk. The area of the forest shelter belts to be built will be 14 million acres, surrounded by land that must be cultivated by rotating grassland cultivation methods. The scale of the plan area and the magnitude of its implementation work are evident. Therefore, a newly established Central Forest Shelter Belt Construction Bureau, affiliated with the Soviet Council of Ministers, has been established.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Deliberate Concealment of Goods Will Soon Backfire; Chiang Ching-kuo Instructs Ten Industries; Determined to Maintain August 19 Price Limits; Action to be Taken Against Major Gold Certificate and Foreign Currency Holders <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo, at 6:20 pm yesterday, convened representatives of ten industries in the Central Bank conference room and gave an important speech lasting forty minutes. Director Wu Kaixian was also present. The representatives of the ten industries were Pan Shihao (dyeing and weaving), Shi Zhifu (western medicine), Liang Songling (soap), Jin Shuping (cigarettes), Le Jiarong (hat making), Guo Linshuang and Liang Weisi (department stores), Yi Jingqing (fiber groceries), Wang Zuosheng (Qi charcoal), Wu Qinghua and Liu Haokai (thermos manufacturing), and Gu Kangrui (coal briquettes). Chiang expressed deep pain over the strange phenomenon of goods evading the market and nine out of ten stores being empty these days. He said that the names of those who deliberately conceal goods have been investigated and made clear, and if they do not change their ways, they will soon face the consequences. He also pointed out that those who exchanged gold certificates and foreign currency in the past two months were all small citizens with wealth below the middle class, and the real major holders have not moved at all. The management office has now collected accurate information and will take effective action from the first of next month to make them serve the country. Comprehensive rationing will be implemented from the first of next month. From then on, each citizen's purchase volume will be restricted by the ration card, and the wealthy will not be able to purchase more than their share. Merchants can also supply goods to the market as much as possible, so that there will be no fear of running out of purchases. The "August 19" price limit decision will be maintained, but the prices of goods other than daily necessities must take into account their production costs, and the government will guarantee the legitimate interests of industry and commerce. Shanghai does not lack raw material inventories. The raw materials controlled by several major companies such as so-and-so can supply the city's factories. As for the foreign raw material supply, President Weng has promised to allocate foreign exchange for purchase when I go to Beijing. As for the adjustment of materials, the established policy will be followed, and the city's yarn and sugar will be exchanged for rice, wheat, and other agricultural products from other cities. Everything will be based on the "August 19" price limit as the standard. Recently, there has been smuggling of goods and a black market for gold certificates. The crackdown will be strengthened. The inspection work will be strengthened starting today in order to eradicate them. After Supervisor Chiang finished speaking, Director Wu Kaixian stood up and gave a speech, expressing his full support for Supervisor Chiang's policy and his firm belief in his success.</p>

<p>The bodies were claimed by their families; the wills were filled with religious atmosphere</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing on the 25th] Yin Lansun, an assistant of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, Yue Xinmin, a customs broker, and Zhang Yuan, a customs broker, were sentenced to death by the Capital District Court. Zhang Baohui was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Mao Fengxiang, Fang Maolin, and seven others were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. After the criminals appealed for review, the Supreme Court approved the death sentences for Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan, and the life sentence for Zhang Baohui. The parts of Mao Fengxiang and Fang Maolin were sent to the Capital High Court for review. The execution orders for Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan had been approved by the Ministry of Justice, acting on behalf of the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office. Zheng Wei, the chief prosecutor, acted on behalf of the prosecutor Tian Jihou of the Capital District Procuratorate, who verified their identities and carried out the executions separately at 9 AM on the 25th. All were killed with one shot. At around 8 AM on the same morning, Tian Jihou, the procurator of the district court, accompanied by clerk Shan Dehou, forensic doctor Song Shihhao, executioner Li Hongbin, and twelve forensic assistants, traveled in one car and one jeep to the Laohuqiao Prison. They were accompanied by Xu Chongwen, the warden, who set up a temporary court inside the prison and had the three criminals brought in. Zhang Yuan was brought in first, wearing an American khaki military uniform and black Rox shoes. Yue Xinmin was wearing a green serge jacket, khaki pants, and yellow leather shoes. Yin Lansun was wearing a cloth Zhongshan suit, yellow leather shoes, and had a crew cut. After the procurator asked them questions one by one, he announced that their applications for retrial had been rejected and that the Ministry of Justice's execution order had arrived. He asked if they had any last words. The three then requested to write wills. Yue Xinmin wanted to read the ruling and asked if there would be no further investigation. He said, "Their white iron sheet permits are all fake, why don't you investigate?" He also said, "Using evidence to kill people, is this kind of killing fair?" Zhang Yuan immediately interjected, "You cannot forgive me, but God will forgive me. Justice is always in people's hearts, and God is just and honest." The three criminals then wrote their wills. Yin Lansun was the calmest. After writing to his wife, Du Yuexiu, he was escorted out by bailiffs and shot dead in the prison's back playground. Yue Xinmin and the other two were executed later, also with one shot. Yin was executed at 8:50 AM, Yue at 9:04 AM. Zhang Yuan was executed at 9:40 AM because he was writing his will. During the executions, the families of the three criminals, Yin Du Yuexiu, Yue Wang Zhenhua, and Zhang Wang Minzhi, were outside the Capital Prison, trying to meet them but failing. After hearing the gunshots, they knew something was wrong and claimed the bodies around 10 AM, sending them to the China Funeral Home for burial.</p>

<p>Yin Lansun's will to his wife stated: "Dear Yue Sister, dear four children, I am called home by the Lord today. May the Lord be with you until we meet again. Although the crisis of life may attack you, the arm of loving kindness will protect you. May the Lord be with you until we meet again. Yin Lansun's last words. Morning of October 25, 1948, Anno Domini." Yue Xinmin's will to his wife said that he was a victim of the times. The will stated: "Zhenhua, my wife, farewell forever. May you be safe and not grieve. I am a victim of the times. I don't feel uncomfortable. I hope you treat my father well and take care of the children. The letter attached to the children, from page six to page seven, there is also a letter I wrote to you in the room that is not finished, you can keep it as a souvenir. Thank you to my brother for his trouble. See you again, please do not be sad, take care of your body, because you still have the responsibility to raise the children and serve my father. Xinmin's last words. Zhang Yuan's will was also filled with a religious atmosphere.</p>
<p>The letter frequently urged his children not to commit crimes for the sake of food and money, and to maintain a life that can only be maintained, without extravagance. There was also a written Christian proverb, chapter thirty-one, the full text of which was about 2,000 words. His instructions also stated: "When we come into the world, we bring nothing and cannot take anything away. Just have clothes and food and be content. Now I order Tigers and Zhaohua to study theology, and Azhi is calm and cautious, and can study medicine to treat people, not to trade for profit, but to heal people with physical and mental illnesses. Miaomiao is very clever and has good eloquence, so she can study law, promote justice, and protect human rights." He continued: "Unfortunately, I was born in a troubled world and cannot get the protection of the law. Although I admit everything frankly, the unfair law has no love. I am not given a chance to reform and I must be punished with the death penalty. Today, your father is ridiculed in front of people and cannot be understood, but I am very comforted." Finally, he said: "I am going to be with Christ, and I will surely protect you and your mother in secret. You should also often pray to be spiritually connected with me. In addition to repeatedly studying the Old and New Testaments, each of you should read at least one chapter of Proverbs every day. There are thirty-one chapters in Proverbs, and you can read all of them once a month." The end note: "Lord! I have come to do your will, may you save my soul." When the bailiffs escorted Zhang Yuan to execution, Zhang repeatedly prayed, "May the heavenly Father be with me."</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning at 6:45 AM, a truck collision occurred at the 219-kilometer point east of Yangqi near several stations between Danyang and Zhenjiang on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line. Upon receiving the report, the local railway bureau urgently dispatched a rescue train from the Changzhou Qiyan Machinery Factory, along with staff from relevant units, to rush to the scene for emergency rescue. According to a subsequent investigation, a train, No. 508, heading from Shanghai to Beijing, was stopped at the entry signal at the 219-kilometer point of Xinfeng, waiting for train No. 503, heading from Beijing to Shanghai, to enter the station for a meet. Unexpectedly, the driver of train No. 503, Zhu Baorong, disregarded the signal and entered the station at excessive speed, resulting in the collision. Both trains were empty on their return journeys and carried only a small amount of coal, so the damage was not significant. However, the driver of train No. 503, Zhu Baorong, was severely injured, while the stokers, Zhang Ji and Zhao Yankang, were killed on the spot. The driver and stoker of train No. 508 sustained minor injuries. Following the accident, passenger ticket sales were only available as far as Danyang for trains going north and Zhenjiang for trains going south. Furthermore, due to the steep terrain near Xinfeng, the use of cranes was quite difficult, and rescue operations were still ongoing late into the evening.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Social Affairs Bureau Assists in Purchasing Rice and Oil Needed by Vocational Schools <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Various universities and vocational schools in the city have recently encountered difficulties in purchasing daily necessities, especially rice, oil, and fuel. The problem of meals for faculty and students residing on campus has caused panic. They have appointed President Wang of Jiaotong University and President Zhang of Fudan University as representatives to visit Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to request assistance in resolving the issue. Director Wu stated that the problem of rice for faculty and students residing on campus can be solved by the Civil Food Allocation Committee, which will notify the treasury to collect payments based on the list of faculty and students applying for rice allocation submitted by each school, before the National Identity Cards are fully issued. The problem of cooking oil can also be solved by the schools submitting a list of faculty and students boarding on campus to the Social Affairs Bureau for review and then purchasing from designated oil shops near the schools. Director Wu has promised to maintain the supply of the above two items, rice and oil, until the end of the year. As for the supply of fuel, which is not under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau, the two presidents will contact the Fuel and Coal Adjustment and Supply Office of the National Resources Commission within days to request assistance in solving the difficulties.

<p>Resolution of the Joint Association of Vocational Colleges and Above</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Joint Association of Vocational Colleges and Above held a meeting at the Tsinghua Alumni Association yesterday afternoon. President Zhang reported on the results of contacting the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the difficulties in purchasing rice, oil, and fuel. The important agenda items discussed were as follows: (1) The city will hold a household census and reissue National Identity Cards. Major colleges and universities have thousands of resident faculty and students. If each person needs to be processed one by one, it will inevitably affect the sleep of resident faculty and students and their studies the next day. In order to avoid any accidents, it was decided to send representatives to visit the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau within days to propose that the household census and the work of reissuing National Identity Cards for colleges and universities can be handled by the head of the school, i.e., the president, without the need for outside personnel to enter the school. (2) The scholarships for this semester have not yet been approved. It was decided to send representatives to the Scholarship Review Committee again to urge the issuance. (3) Each college and university needs to pay 50 yuan for sports fees for various sports competitions. For this semester, 25 yuan will be collected temporarily and sent to the Dasha University, which is responsible for accounting.</p>

<h3 id="e114">The Battle City of Taiyuan <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 20th] The defense of Taiyuan, which began on the 5th of this month, has been raging for more than half a month. According to an estimate by Yang Ai-yuan, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, the attacking bandit army has suffered more than 30,000 casualties. The war situation is critical and continues to worsen. Late at night on the 18th, Yang Ai-yuan, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, and Wang Huai-ming, Speaker of the Shanxi Provincial Assembly, flew to Peiping to seek assistance from the President. The President promised to provide his full support and decided to airlift reinforcements again.</p>
<p>Air Transport of Reinforcements</p>
<p>The central government has long been determined to defend Taiyuan, because the importance of Taiyuan in the overall national situation is self-evident. At the same time, the twenty-odd light and heavy industries, large-scale modern factories that have been fully operational for the past three years, can manufacture locomotives, refine steel, produce military weapons and daily necessities for both military and civilian use. In today's war-torn country, they are particularly valuable national assets. The only guarantee for this airlift of reinforcements and supplies is the safeguarding of the remaining northern airfield (located fifteen li north of the city).</p>
<p>Bandit Army Replenishment</p>
<p>The Jinzhong Campaign in July was extremely fierce. According to a military officer who was captured and escaped back to Xi'an, the bandit side claimed that in the battles in villages such as Dachang in the suburbs of Yu, Tai, and Xu counties, the bandits suffered more than 60,000 casualties. However, the bandit side quickly replenished its forces through threats, enticements, and other vicious means. In just two months, it had once again gathered what it called the First Corps of the North China Field Army and tens of thousands of troops from the Jinzhong, Taiyue, Luliang, and Jinsui Military Regions, returning with renewed vigor. Under the command of the bandit leader Xu Xiangqian, they ignited the fierce flames of the siege of Taiyuan.</p>
<p>Mountainous Areas</p>
<p>Taiyuan has now become an isolated city under siege. Yan Xishan has subsequently put forward the slogan of "Building a Battle City of Taiyuan," aiming to develop in the aspects of living, production, and combat, so that military, political, economic, social, educational, and all other departments' personnel, as well as male and female citizens, are all combat-ready, to ensure the defense of Taiyuan and restore the whole of Shanxi. The Communist bandits certainly do not want this work to be effective, so at the very beginning of the establishment of the battle city, they launched a full-scale and comprehensive offensive. Taiyuan is located in a basin, and controlling the mountainous areas on the east and west sides, a dozen or so li away from the city, is the guarantee of Taiyuan's safety.</p>
<p>Arc-Shaped Battle Line</p>
<p>Taiyuan's difficulty originally lies in food supply, as the summer harvest has not been collected and there is no autumn grain to collect either. The food for more than 300,000 citizens and tens of thousands of soldiers relies solely on stockpiles and air transport. Today, how to reverse the war situation is the most important thing. Taiyuan is known throughout the country for its solid city defense works. High, medium, low, and underground bunkers, as well as firing points made of brick, stone, cement, and reinforced steel bars, are scattered around the city. However, the recent battles have already partially penetrated this solid defense line. The arc-shaped battlefield from the northeast of the city to the south is all located on the mountain ridges ten to twenty li away from the city. Removing the threat to the city walls and ensuring the security of the northern airfield both depend on the heroic National Army destroying the bandit army on this arc-shaped battlefield in the mountainous area.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the Peiping Assembly Appropriates Funds for Funeral Expenses</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 25th] The mother of He Xiaoxian, an accountant of the Peiping Assembly, committed suicide yesterday by drowning herself in a water tank due to poverty. He earns 60 yuan a month, but recently, due to the high cost of living, his mother went to the streets every day to try to buy corn flour but could not. The whole family has been filling their stomachs with sweet potatoes, and she was mentally stimulated, finally committing suicide. Speaker Xu decided to take care of her funeral expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Jiaxing Grain Loan Case Concluded at the Haining District Court <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Our Haining Dispatch, 23rd] The Jiaxing Grain Loan Case, which was transferred by the Zhejiang High Court to this county's District Court, was heard on the 22nd. The main figure in this case, Huang Tongsheng, the Standing Director of the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce and the Chairman of the Rice Industry Association, was accused by Jiang Xisheng, a resident of Zhongquan Road, Jiaxing, in February of this year to the High Prosecutor's Office for abusing his power in grain loan corruption. The Jiaxing District Court felt deeply inconvenient to hear this case, so it requested the High Court to transfer jurisdiction. The High Court designated this county's District Court to hear the case. The case has been declared concluded and will be sentenced at 9:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Snakes Everywhere in Changzhou, Armed Scalpers Appear <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch, 23rd] The 819 price limit for economic reform in Changzhou has been implemented until today, and the situation has reached its limit. For the past three days, it has not been possible to buy a whole dan (unit of weight) of rice in the urban area. Changzhou Middle School and Private Zhengwei Middle School, which have many students, have not been able to purchase daily rations of rice, firewood, oil, and salt, so they have had to temporarily close and dismiss the students, telling each student to bring rice from home. However, the rice in the rural areas of Changzhou has just been harvested and has not yet been processed into rice, so it cannot be brought back immediately. To cope with this, the Grain Association decided on the 23rd to allow each person to purchase half a sheng (unit of volume) of rice per day with their National Identification Card. Naturally, ten long queues have been formed in ten places. The oil pressing has been a long queue for more than a week. The fiercest people in the middle are armed scalpers. Several iron gates and counters of oil factories have been subjected to beatings. Oil factories lose one jin (unit of weight) for every jin they sell. There is no way to replenish the soybeans, and this crisis cannot be managed. From the 20th, each person is allowed to purchase one jin of oil per month with their identification card, but the congestion in the long queues has not been eliminated at all. Nine out of ten shops on the main street are empty. They open after 10:00 a.m. and close at 3:00 p.m., all cold and desolate, matching the bleak autumn season!</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Food in the urban area has presented a serious panic. The People's Food Adjustment Committee has decided: Absolutely prohibit external transportation and strictly prohibit the black market. First, organize a joint food distribution center, targeting ordinary people (including public and educational personnel), limited to 20,000 people in the urban area. The Jiaxiu Town Office will create a register, report it to the committee, and issue permits for distribution. Regardless of the size of the family, each person will receive two dou (unit of volume) per month. Exchange goods with Shanghai, which will be organized by the County Joint Cooperative and various trade associations.</p>

<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 24th] The Waterxigou Iron Mine in Fuyuan has a very long history. Recently, the Geological Survey Institute sent personnel to conduct a survey, and it is estimated that the iron ore reserves reach 50,000 tons. If 1,200 jin are smelted daily, it will be enough for more than 100 years of mining and smelting. Moreover, coking coal, coke, refractory clay, and other smelting materials are all nearby, making it worthwhile to develop.</p>

<p>Yuyao</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shi Xiangting, the current Bao secretary of the Liangnong District, a native of Shandong, recently felt unable to maintain his livelihood because the county has not paid his salary for a long time. He suddenly developed a world-weary thought and hanged himself on the night of the 19th, leaving behind a wife and many children. The situation is particularly tragic.</p>
<p>Wenling</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Second Detachment of the Security Police Team stationed at Xiafeng Mountain, about ten li away from the city, was attacked by more than 100 bandits at about 7:00 a.m. on the 17th, and 30 to 40 firearms were seized. Chen Zuolin, the detachment leader, fought bravely and was injured in the abdomen, dying on the 18th. In addition, the Wenjiao Town Police Station was also attacked by bandits on the 17th, and documents were burned.</p>
<p>Tongxiang</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] For the 37th year of land tax, the County Land and Grain Office, after receiving an order from the Provincial Office, stipulates that if there are indeed business households with no grain to pay the tax, they are allowed to convert it into brown rice, but the quality must be clean and dry. The conversion rate is 79.38 jin of brown rice per stone (unit of volume).</p>
<p>Jinhua</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the wave of panic buying reached Jinhua, the supply of goods has been exhausted. Nine out of ten shops in the market are empty.

<p>Liuhe</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The 66th Division of the National Army, in coordination with the local county security squadron and self-defense forces, chased and suppressed the bandit army entrenched in Bazhen day and night.

<p>Nan</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The County Chamber of Commerce believes that the business hours of various businesses are not regulated, resulting in inconsistent opening and closing times during the period of economic control. In order to unify control, it has specially stipulated the business hours of various industries. Among them, fresh meat and soybean oil are only sold in the morning. Fresh meat is also stipulated to be sold only from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., a total of three hours. Most of the other industries are open from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m., or 9:00 p.m.</p>

<p>(1) Any person has the right to apply to the government authorities for work to solve their livelihood problems. The government authorities should introduce all idle manpower into various production industries. What is particularly important is that, before the production sector is able to accommodate transfers, do not create "artificial" unemployed masses.</p>
<p>(2) All arable wasteland and open land must be immediately cultivated and used as much as possible; the government should formulate good agricultural plans to make all agricultural products meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>(3) Stabilize rural order and eliminate all inequalities in rural areas; the government should at any time appoint clean and caring people to visit and inquire about the hardships of the peasants. Political workers in rural areas who have outstanding achievements should be given special rewards. Diligent and persistent farmers can also receive preferential treatment in the form of reduced taxes and exemption from military service.</p>
<p>(4) The government should do its best to help solve the problems of industrial production tools, raw materials, power, and labor. The evaluation of products must take into account costs and legitimate profits. The threat of imported goods should also be resisted by the government. Factories with excellent performance should be given priority and more favorable quotas for loans, raw materials, and power.</p>
<p>(5) The primary business of national banks should be to support productive enterprises. Loan programs should meet the needs of the majority of the people. The responsibilities between various bank bureaus and treasuries must be clearly delineated. If there is surplus capacity, they can also engage in other banking businesses. Private banks must transfer a certain percentage of their daily deposit balance to the central bank or assist a national bank in engaging in production loans. The collateral for commercial loans should be limited to daily necessities; the situation of all collateral should be reported by each bank to the local designated agency at any time. If the market price of a certain collateral soars, the government authorities have the right to purchase it at the market price when it was provided as security and distribute it to the people at a fair price.</p>
<p>(6) Consolidate the security of various industrial areas. The government should give various rewards to those who operate productive enterprises and have outstanding achievements. The interests of term depositors in banks must be protected so that floating capital gradually flows into the production sector.</p>
<p>(7) If the social productivity expands, various important materials such as cotton, cloth, rice, wheat, paper, coal, and steel can also be purchased to supplement paper money reserves. However, the quality of the purchased goods must be strictly regulated; the purchase prices in various places should also be separately verified.</p>
<p>Finally, let's discuss how to balance the national treasury's revenue and expenditure. To achieve a balance between the national treasury's revenue and expenditure, there is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. On the revenue side, the most basic measures are of course to eliminate corruption in tax authorities and reduce the expenditure of tax authorities. If you want to increase tax revenue, you must first increase the amount of production in society and prohibit luxury and waste to increase the ability of the people to pay taxes. As for new sources of tariffs, they should target luxury goods and non-essential goods. For example, the private cars, mansions, gardens, villas, pianos, shortwave radios, etc. of the rich should be taxed on a regular basis. Ordinary people's hotels, cafeterias, barbershops, photo studios, etc. do not need to pay public taxes, but their prices should be strictly controlled, and they are not allowed to lay out unnecessary equipment or consume luxurious goods. However, luxury hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, and service venues can freely set prices, and can lay out perfect equipment, hire sufficient service personnel, store rich food, and even allow the consumption of limited imported goods; but they must pay heavier taxes. Appropriate tax rates should also be set for various non-essential goods such as tobacco, alcohol, wool, silk, foreign tea, etc.; among them, tobacco and alcohol taxes must be paid in cash, and other goods can also be offset at the market price when paying taxes. The government should also prevent tax evasion. For example, alcohol must be sold in bottles, tea must be sold in bags, and numbered tax stamps must be sealed on the seams. The entrance tickets for entertainment venues should be printed uniformly by the government.</p>
<p>Let's discuss saving the expenditure of the national treasury. Construction costs, construction costs, rent for real estate, entertainment expenses, and transportation expenses in various agencies, all unnecessary ones, should be saved as much as possible. Improve the work efficiency of civil servants, and promote the surplus manpower of various agencies to transfer into the production sector, or provide short-term training and recommend them to newly established institutions. Currently, the biggest burden on the national treasury is the cost of suppressing the rebellion. In order to avoid the extra expenditure caused by setbacks in the war, in a passive way, we should try to improve the living and medical equipment of soldiers, make good use of dangerous places, consolidate defense projects, maintain secrecy, and seek more benefits for the families of soldiers. Actively, we should start by revitalizing politics. If politics is on track, not only can the Kuomintang be in an invincible position, but the internal strife can also be ended sooner.</p>
<p>This currency reform plan, except for the fact that the freezing of commodity prices on a certain day and the neglect of supporting productive enterprises are indeed worthy of review, the rest are theoretically stable and feasible. Not long after the currency reform, the government launched a diligent and frugal nation-building movement, which is indeed a timely move. Because if the diligent and frugal movement is effective, the currency reform will also be successful. However, in order to promote the smooth development of the diligent and frugal movement, we must first rely on the leading implementation of party and government officials. (End)</p>
