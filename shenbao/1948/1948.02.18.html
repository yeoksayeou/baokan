<h3 id="c28">韓北傀儡政府的出現！ <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>糾紛不巳的朝鮮問題，現又進入新的嚴重的階段·據蘇聯控制的朝鮮平壤電台宣佈：北韓蘇軍佔領區中巳成立「民主人民共和國」，並段立「北韓人民軍」。這個政府的組織是採蘇維埃制，人民委員會主席爲金日成，其憲法規定的國旗，是白底綴以紅色橫條，國徽是白底上畫紅星一顆，圍以交叉的鎚子和鐮刀各二，稻草，鋼鐵工人及一座山。聯合國和美國很注意這事態，正在南韓工作的聯合國朝鮮委員會委員們已陸續撤返成功湖，出席十九日舉行之聯合國小型大會，準備就全般的朝鮮間題有所報吿。這些事實，表徵了聯合國朝鮮委員會的失敗，蘇聯蓄意分裂朝鮮的陰狠，韓南韓北不自覺不團結的危機，從此將爲遠東，爲未來世界，帶來新的嚴重的禍亂！</p>
<p>朝鮮又名韓國，是大戰後爭執最大糾紛最多的地帶之一。這些爭執和糾紛的造成，說句老實話，那是開羅，波茨坦，和莫斯科外長會議歷次的秘密外交，鑄成了大錯，不啻早爲朝鮮安排了一齣悲劇！一九四三年十月的開羅會議，對朝鮮獨立自由雖提有保證，可惜「決定在相當時期，使朝鮮自由獨立」，因爲獨立尙需「相當時期」，所以這保瞪不啻一半落了空。而尤其錯得可笑的，波茨坦會議決定以北緯三十八度爲界，由美蘇軍隊分別佔領朝鮮南北；一九四五年二月雅爾達會議，蘇聯更對朝鮮若干島嶼　出領士要求，藉以恢復帝俄時代所掠奪的權利，羅斯福總統因病，遂於進退失據中接受了。同年十二月莫斯科外長會議，決定美蘇分佔朝鮮南北，由軍司令部代表組織混合委員會，協助成立朝鮮臨時政府，然後再建統一的民主自治政府。不過在韓國完全獨立以前，尙須經過五年的委任託管。朝鮮人民反對託管，反對美蘇軍隊分佔南北，但强權國家基於國際會議的錯誤，不顧韓人反對，硬要錯到底，披甲荷戈走進了朝鮮，於北緯三十八度勉强的築立了攔柵，將好好整個的朝鮮生呑活剝地分裂爲兩個區域！</p>
<p>在漢城的美蘇混合委員會，從一九四六年三月成立起至去年十一月十四日聯合國大會通過七項方案時爲止，很少和諧空氣，尤乏合作象徵。聯大方案規定組織一個朝鮮委員會，由九國派代表到朝鮮工作，監督全韓選舉，協助政府組織·今年一月八日，各國代表集會漢城，幷推印度代表梅農爲主席，決以三月卅一日爲總選期·委員會在韓工作一月，遭受困難重重：一方面，蘇聯的不合作態度，烏克蘭的不參加委員會，與夫北韓拒絕委員會到北緯卅八度以北，陷委員會人士於啼笑皆非之狀。另方面，南韓政黨的分歧，李承晚金九等的固執，以及南韓共黨的罷工與破壞，愈陷委員會工作於進退維谷之境。委員會衝不破韓南韓北的政治鴻溝，爭取不到蘇聯的合作，而朝鮮各黨各派，計較着思想的左右，不知自覺自勉，更非委員會中立人士所能說服。在此情形下，委員會的工作，一籌莫展，梅農帶着失望的心情而去，準備將這混亂的狀態，擬就報告書，提供小型聯大討論。</p>
<p>小型聯大對朝鮮問題的對策如何，將是値得注視的問題。看趨勢，小型聯大可能接受委員會的建議，暫於南韓完成選舉，組織臨時性的政府，以待北韓的合作。蘇聯爲了打擊小型聯大未來的決定，爭取機先，乃於朝鮮委員會一行離韓之際，突然先宣佈北韓「民主人民共和國」的成立，從此傀儡登塲，壁壘森嚴，開始了朝鮮民族的悲劇。我們重視這個事態，關切朝鮮分裂局勢的發展，不得不在平壤電台宣佈北韓共和國出現的今天，指出這個問題對遠東的嚴重影饗：</p>
<p>（一）北韓共和國出現，不僅達反開羅波茨坦雅爾達多次會議的決定，並且破壞了莫斯科協定，和聯合國迭次的決定。蘇聯的片面行動，對美國與聯合國均是一重威脅，甚且對中國和日本，也潛伏了威膏的作用。東北的中共　軍，與北韓同氣相連，今後中共的紅色政變，勢將步北韓的後塵，隨時可以在東北出現新的僞滿洲國。這個紅色的僞滿洲國，設不幸而言中，與外蒙北韓結成遠東紅色的堡壘，將爲遠東帶來股重的威脅，將爲世界帶來新的危機，而且將爲人類浩刧帶來不可想像的前途，將與九一八後日本所製造的偽滿洲國毫無二致，而且尤有過之。</p>
<p>（二）北韓共和國的出現，說明蘇聯有席捲全韓的企圖。北韓政府現有軍隊廿餘萬，南韓則號稱民主而無武裝；北韓有大量的軍火貯藏，南韓則無自衛儲備。美國觀察家預料北韓政府出現後，蘇軍表面上將撤出韓境，北韓對南韓的挑釁行動，必將跨過北緯卅八度界綫，乃至進攻南韓各要隘，完成他們心目中全韓的「統一」。蘇聯宣傳家對世界說：蘇軍撤退，不負朝鮮內戰的責任，與當時蘇軍的撤退長春瀋陽相同，實則朝鮮的內戰，乃是蘇聯佈就了的席捲全韓的計劃。現在朝鮮南北陰影四伏，內戰的序慕已經在北韓共和國出現之時揭開了。</p>
<p>（三）北韓共和國的出現，及蘇軍的準備撤退，對美國態度將發生新的影響。美國如果不復能容忍這局勢的發展，撤出南韓，退保日本，今後勢將接受北韓的挑釁，由朝鮮的內戰，演化爲國際性的戰爭。美國目前對遠東態度的徬徨，是否被迫走上這條路，我們此際難於預料。但美國對遠東的政策，必將因此而不能不作新的決定與轉變，則是意料中事。</p>
<p>總之，北韓共和國的出現，爲朝鮮帶來苦痛可憫的悲劇。我們爲朝鮮獨立前途和遠東未來局勢，感到無限憂痛。眼前一切的危機，潛伏着禍亂的暗景，潛伏着戰神的魔影。如果美國還是舉棋不定，如果聯合國還是孱弱無力，遠東的前途，實亦禍多而福少！</p>

<p>〔本報台北十七日電〕張嘉璈十七日下午一　對記者談：省內鐵路亟需補充器材。車輛·枕木，加强運輸。電力亦須補充。中央撥購肥料八萬噸，仍感不敷，希添建新廠。渠對省內特產換取外匯，希望不大。合幣隨時調整，認係中央支持表現。又稱：國省民營企業應配合聯繫，即外來投資亦須在我經建計劃下進行。渠特別强調詆須對有益者，中央莫不支持，切希內地來台工作者刻苦研究，蓋日人建台窮年累月，吾人不應草　敷衍將事。渠確已允籌美金九百萬，改進鐵路電力，並允扶助民營企業，更允供給國營公可法幣頭寸。</p>
<p>張氏認爲從事建設台灣，須將心理魏設列為第一，經濟建設列爲第二，欲謀經濟建設，須以心理　設為其基礎。合灣之工礦事業，先天條件並不富足，全賴人爲力量促成，較束北遜色多多。渠認爲鐵路交通及電力，乃目前景應特別注意之團項事業，台省鐵路運輸能力，目前每日僅爲一萬二千噸，運輸之貨品以糖·煤·米·等爲其大宗，倘就砂糖一項而言每月僅　運糖一萬二千噸，而台糖公司今年產糖卅萬噸，實難全部運輸出口，因而必須多建倉庫，甚至可能因此影響明年產糖五十萬噸之計劃。張氏又稱：肥料與製糖關係台省農民生活甚大，此兩事業之重要性僅次於鐵路及電力。張氏認爲應予重視之企業，則爲可以換外匯之工業，例如水泥，茶葉·　腦等，以及可以節省外匯支出之工業，例如石油，造紙及製碱等。張氏談及煤業時，認爲台省出產之煤炭，由於過去儘　運　上海之結果，反使台省之若干工業因缺煤焦而减少生產量，例如轉廠及水泥廠，即皆感煤炭不敷應用。張氏稱：「余對撥款協助台灣工礦事業發展一事，已予最大注意，然一切具體計劃，需俟返滬後審力而行」。</p>

<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>爭取勝利和前提決定一切</p>
<p>一九四一年六月二十二日，當希特勒侵犯蘇聯的消息傳給我的時候，我方臥病在家。我立即打電話給總統，艦助打給副國務卿韋爾斯。我對他們兩個人都這樣說：</p>
<p>「我們必須以一切援助給予蘇聯，無所不用其極。我們曾經屢次說過，我們將盡力之所及以一切援助給予任何抵抗軸心的國家。蘇聯將屬於此一範疇之內，毫無猶豫餘地。」</p>
<p>我知道若干軍事專家，無論在這裏或國外，都在　料希特勒在戰爭中，將以數星期之時間消滅蘇聯。但是我不能相信這種說法，猶如我不能相信許多說法，就是說在法國淪陷之後，英國的崩潰將是幾星期的事情。在一九四〇年夏季，我們以大量的武器運往英國的時候，我覺得我們並不是冒着眞正的危險，會使這些武器落入德國人之手的。我同樣相信我們可以把一切可能弄到的武器和供應品送往蘇聯，而不致有被德國人　獲的眞正危險。假如總統和我懷疑蘇聯抵抗德國的能力，　麼明明以爲武器會落入希特　之手而還要把武器送給蘇聯，未免太蠶了。</p>
<p>半年來我們有很好的理由，可以相信希特勒是會進攻蘇聯的，所以六月二十二日的事件，並不使我們驚奇。</p>
<p>一九四一年一月，我國駐柏林的商務參贊荷特接到一個秘密報吿。荷特有一個德國朋友，這個人雖然是納粹的一個敵人，但是和德國各部院，德意志銀行和高級納粹黨員有密切關係，。呈在一九四〇年八月，這個朋友就通知荷特證，當時希特勒的總司令部正在舉行會議，準備進攻蘇聯的戰爭。這個消息，在幾星期之後變成更具體，據說當時希特勒曾經說過他想「從海參崴到直布羅陀祇有我的兵士。」</p>
<p>荷特常常在柏林一家電影院中遇見這個朋友。這個朋友託一個機關定了座位，送兩張票子給荷特，設法坐在他旁邊，並且在半黑暗之中，把紙條塞入荷特的袋中。</p>
<p>從荷特來的消息，和希特勒正在計劃侵犯英國的不少證據，顯屬相反。但是和荷特的朋友接觸的結果，却說空襲英國乃是　糖烟幕，藉以掩蔽希特勒眞正的，估計周密的計劃，準備一個突然的兇猛的對蘇進攻。</p>
<p>其後，荷特的朋友通知他說，德國的戰爭機構正在組織俄羅斯沙皇時代的二十一個舊州政府，業巳成立，這些地方的經濟工作人員，業已任命。成捆的盧布票業已印就。</p>
<p>最後，荷特經他的朋友和德國的總參謀部接觸之後，獲悉了希特勒軍略計劃的要點——就是說，分成三個鍥形，北面的，南面的，和決定性的中路，直指莫斯科。所有的準備，在一九四一年春季必須完成。　當荷特有關這一切情報的報吿送到我的地方時，這是如此突兀，起初我還以爲是德國人的一個「詐局」。我把它交給聯邦調查局局長何佛，請他發表意見。何佛認爲它是眞實的。荷特吿訴我一種方法，就是把這些報吿向一個出亡在美國的著名德國人去獲得證實，於是我請助理國務卿朗格去看他，去獲得這種證實，結果他辦到了。我並且和總統討論過這個報吿。</p>
<p>於是我就決定這個報告的內容應該通知蘇大使奧受斯基。我相信這一步驟，是和我國對蘇應持的適當態度相符合的。當時，在我建議之下，韋爾斯正在和奧曼斯基舉行一連串的談話，以謀消除我們兩國之間的異見，所以我就請韋爾斯促蘇大使對該項情報加以注意。韋爾斯照辦了。</p>
<p>當從同一的來源又有情報傳給我時，我再把它交給韋爾斯，請他向奧曼斯基轉達。這一點，他在三月二十日做了。</p>
<p>奧曼斯基無疑是把這個情報送呈他的政府，猶如他說過他會這樣做的。它對亽蘇聯政策的影響怎樣，殊難斷言。但是，僅在三星期之後，史達林突然和日本外相松岡簽訂了一個互不侵犯條約，當時松岡以爲這樣一個條約是不可能的。中達林簽訂這個條約，目的無疑是在遠東方面保護他自己，因爲他相信希特勒是想在歐洲方面攻擊他的。再者，在希特勒企圖把巴爾幹國家納入軸心範圍的計劃之前，蘇聯對它們所採取的政策，比可能預料到的更爲堅强。</p>
<p>蘇聯在一九三九年八月間，曾刺激希特勒，使他從事歐洲戰爭，並且當波蘭正在拚命抵抗德軍的時候，協助他侵犯波蘭。但是自從一九西〇年六月以來，它却在許多方面千涉和阻撓希特勒的目的。</p>
<p>我們所獲得的希特勒正在計劃侵犯蘇聯的消息，對於我和日本人道行會讀時　有用。它或消了蘇聯和日本聯盟的任何可能性，並且使我們對付日本，比在相反的情形之下可以採取更堅强的態度。</p>
<p>不幸得很，奧曼斯基和羣　斯的討論破裂了，或者毋寗說是在一種尖刻的交談之中決裂了。奧曼斯基一向認爲堅決就是粗魯，所以是最難應付的‘更有進者，他的政府派他到　裏來，是在要求向我們購買更多的重要物資，而希望奧曼斯基能够獲得，但是由於我們對英國的養務，我們是無法照辦的。</p>
<p>五月十四日，奧曼斯基來看我，神情陰沉。在我們談話的最初二十分鐘中，他列舉我們兩國政府之間的異見。這種異見，據他說自從夏季以來曾和韋爾斯討論達二十二次之多而一無結果。於是他就交給我由他自己簽字的一個照會，講到一艘滿載物資的船被延緩啓程赴蘇。他的照會講到我們的「仇視態度」，並且威脅說他的政府將從我們的態度中「作一切必要的結論」。繼而他在口頭上重覆二三次說，我們的行動，仍是由於對他的政府實行仇視，並且是由於個人的仇視的一種個人的行爲。</p>
<p>我就在那裏制止他說：「當我想到一個國家的時候，我是想到它的人民比想到它的政府爲多。我和我的政府對於任何國家的人民，沒有絲滬的仇視。關於蘇聯和它的政府，我個人並無絲奄仇視之意，我的政府亦屬如此。把個人牽涉到政府的行動，不但是完全不準確，並且是極不公平的。我並不希望你在離開我的辦公室時，以爲把這種責難加到我國政府的頭上業已獲得成功，因爲這是絕對沒有有根據的」。</p>
<p>我在結束談話時說，在我們於一九三三年承認蘇聯之前或之後，我們一向是蘇聯人民的朋友。談論至此，稍爲有了一點生氣。</p>
<p>在六月份的第一個星期中，”我們從駐布却萊斯特和斯德哥爾摩的公使館接到可以令人置信的電報，說德國將在二星期之內進犯蘇聯。國務院把這些報吿送給在莫斯科的史丹因哈特大使。</p>
<p>在希特勒進兵蘇聯八天之前，邱吉爾首相打一個電報給總統說，從他可以獲得消息的每一個來源，使他相信德國的大規模進攻蘇聯，好像立即就要發生。他說，假如新戰爭爆發了，英國根據希特勒是它必須擊敗的敵人這個原則，當然將以一切的鼓勵以及任何可以節省下來的東西，去援助蘇聯。他證他並不覺得在英國會發生階級意識的政治反應，相信德蘇的衝突不會使我們陷入窘境。</p>
<p>衝突並沒有使我們陷入窘境，而給我克服希特勒主義的新希望。我從白硫磺泉與總統和韋爾斯不斷保持接觸，敦促我們應以最有力的保證給予蘇聯，說我們將在能力範圍之內予以一切援助。總統派霍浦金從倫敦到莫斯科去調查蘇聯的掌事需要。羅斯福先生解凍蘇聯的資金，決定不使用中立法。八月二日，代理國務卿韋爾斯和奧曼斯基大使交換函件，我們允許「給予一切可能的濟經援助，以謀增强蘇聯反抗武裝侵略的鬥爭」。</p>
<p>八月四日，我晤見奧曼斯基，他帶着蘇聯的哥里柯夫將軍。吳曼斯基的態度，和我們上一次會晤時的態度大不相同了。我吿訴他當我不在這裏時，特別是回來之後，我對於蘇聯獲得我們可以節省下來的一切軍用供應一點，深表興趣。哥里柯夫將軍說，他在兩星期前巳把他政府的需要向國務院提出，但是唯一的結果，就是裝了六十架飛機到蘇聯去，而蘇聯最需要的是高射砲和攻坦克砲。我答應加倍努力援助，儘速裝出這些武器。</p>
<p>當我和蘇聯的來客談話時，總統正和邱吉爾首相在舉行大西洋會議。蘇聯對於此一會議，極爲重視。霍浦金也出席這次會議。當他就蘇聯抵抗希特勒侵略的能力提出樂觀的報吿之後，總統和首相對於發給史達林的聲明獲得了同意。總統於八月十三日把這個際明用無綫電打給我，呌我用電報打到莫斯科去。</p>
<p>兩位領袖向費達林保證說，「我們目下正協力以你所最迫切需要的供應品，以最大量供給你，已經有許多總滿載物資的船離開了我們的海岸，在不久的將來，將有更冬艘的船隻開出」。他們建議在莫斯科舉行會議，來分析蘇聯的需要，由英美派高級代表到蘇聯去出席。</p>
<p>大西洋會議的故事，在別的地方已經說過好幾次。這次會議是在我在白硫磺泉養病的時候準備的，當我回到華盛頓的時候，總統已經啓程赴會。羅斯福先生想和邱吉爾親自舉行會議，已有好幾個月。我第一次獲悉此事，是在五月底。</p>
<p>七月二十八日，韋爾斯寫信到白硫磺泉給我說，會議已定於八月八日九日和十日舉行，並且吿訴我，假如總統所想討論的超越純軍事問題的範圍，他想敦促他帶一個人和他一同去，因此可以把談話以及可能獲致的協議，準確的記錄下來</p>
<p>在使總統和首相因親自密切接觸而獲致相互的理解上，會議的成就頗多。在英國戰艦「威爾斯親王」號與我國巡洋艦「奧古斯太」號上，兩大偉人開始了這種奇特而親密的關係，這對於加速戰爭的結束，極關重要。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本月十二日在松江，奉賢兩縣交界處海濱登陸之少數共匪，經國軍，保安隊及各地自衛部隊圍剿擊潰後，已分成二股，到處流竄。前日深夜十一時，殘匪五十餘人偸越封鎖綫，從亭林以東向北逃竄，於千步涇渡口偸渡浦江，經四家浜，何巷，在萃莊與新橋間穿越鐵路，折向西行，於昨日上午八時在離松江城十四里松泗公路中途站賣花橋鎭，被當地自衛隊發現，立加痛擊。匪不敵，逃竄至離泗涇三華里之塘橋，其時靑浦縣自衛隊已得訊趕到，稍有接觸，匪即向余山，天馬山潰退。靑浦縣部隊緊隨追剿，匪不敢在山中久留，而夭馬山以西，三區保安司令部已派部隊嚴密封鎖，至晚六時許殘匪開始向松江縣城方面回竄，七時許扺離松江城廿餘里處之深巷鄉，國軍×××旅×××團副團長鄭棽，於得訊後即率部進剿。另一股殘匪十餘人於下午五時半在莊行與亭林間之烟墩頭發現，國軍×××旅部一營會同浦南各鄕自衛隊正包圍剿捕中。</p>

<p>登陸共匪不足百人</p>
<p>當局昨巳接獲最可靠之情報，此次登陸匪徒係由匪首丁錫山親自率領。丁匪現化名「再次」副匪首湯景豐係蘇北人，爲共匪老幹部。其下設宣傳科，「科長」胡某，「秘書」爲伍某，「參謀」爲王雲，又名王祖耀，（丁鍚山之外甥），及楊志超。其兵力爲一個特務排，有士兵十三名，由湯景豐率領。兩個戰鬥排，共約官兵六十多名，都係浙東，浦東或浦南人。又據報：武器甚精良，計有輕機槍五挺，每挺有子彈七八百發，湯姆生槍十枝，每枝有彈藥二百餘發，卡平槍一枝，快機一枝，手槍三枝，三八式及七九式步槍二十餘枝，每枝配子彈百餘發，擲彈筒三具，手熘彈一千二百枚。其服裝一律灰棉軍服（花條子布夾裏黑鐵扣子），所帶背包已在潘家角一役中拋棄，糧秣千餘斤亦已拋棄。現竄余山，天馬山一股殘匪，係由丁錫山率領。隱匿烟墩頭一股，係由湯景豐率領。前者約五十餘人，後者不足二十人。其最初企圖在浦南登陸後，隱匿浦南各鄕村中，進行其組織工作。如不能立足浦南，則經靑浦，蘆墟，吳江竄往太湖。</p>
<p>排長反正報告受騙</p>
<p>記者昨訪晤此次登陸來犯共匪中一反正排長，名詹秀峯，松江人，係前松江縣縣長黃超人之衛士。據稱：於去年六月間有友人魏某，謂可介紹其在某貨船上工作，其時詹正失業，欣然而往，於去年六月廿九日由魏某領往一小港中，果有木帆船一艘，上船後之習日，木船即行開航出吳淞口。甫出口即有一機輪駛近，由機輪轉過十餘人，均備有槍枝，其中一人，被呼爲老闆。木船又兜往金山嘴，又有數人登舟，木船載足人數後，即駛往蘇北東台縣南槍口登岸，登岸後即在海邊一不知名之僻靜鄉村受訓。訓練不甚嚴格，每天上操一小時，上政治課四小時，生活極苦，係日吃兩粥一飯，居住草棚。本月十日奉命混合共匪老幹部，分赴軓船兩艘實行登陸，渠則趁前夜偸越封鎖綫時脫隊逃逸來松江，向專員公署自首。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海監獄在押囚犯楊關壽，施瑞慶，張異新等密吿監獄看守虐待囚犯一事，記者爲此昨訪地方法院院長查良鑑，查院長談稱：「法院常接獲此項密吿函，惟在事無佐證之先，未便輕予發表，此次囚犯密吿監獄各點，查與事實頗多出人，中央社遽予公開發表，深覺遺憾」。記者繼又驅車至上海監獄訪問，孔祥霖典獄長對此頗表灰心，稱密告所控各節，幷非事實，歡迎記者入內參觀，所謂「風波亭」（即和監者），原係舊工部局時代之設備，屋頂上闢有小窗，係專爲患肺病或氣管支炎病犯而設，亦即爲隔離病房之用，前次「龍頭」鬧監，曾將一部份滋事犯人另押「和監」隔離，事態平息以後，即仍還押原處。</p>
<p>和監閱無一人　記者昨至「和監」參觀時，內中巳閱無一人，孔典獄長繼吿記者，楊關壽，施瑞慶，張異新三犯，均係盜匪案，係警備可令都軍法處判刑者，楊判八年，施判十二年，張判十年，平日在獄內即常鬧監，去年一月曾鬧監一次，經地院以妨害公務罪每人加判徒刑七個月。</p>
<p>提三囚犯談話　嗣孔典獄長以極坦白之態度，將三〇三八號楊關壽，三〇四一號施瑞慶，三〇三六號張異新由獄中提出，與記者自由談話，旁邊亦無人監視，施犯稱：對監獄無不滿之處，密吿函何人所寫，則不知道。楊犯稱：半個月前會與同監犯人談過不滿意監獄當局設施，惟並未寫密吿函，張犯亦稱不知道，正在記者與囚犯談話之時，九一一號囚犯因不守規則，竟將看守馬敬端面部打腫，看守等向記者哭訴，此輩犯人兇悍異常，殊難管理云。</p>
<p>向以鬧事著名　記者昨又趨訪地檢處首席檢察官黃亮，詢問對於囚犯密控監獄一事，是否將派員偵查，黃首席稱：據調查此三犯人均係軍事犯，在獄中鬧事着各，前會請警備司令部將該三犯移押陸軍監獄未果，至於密吿函中所控各看守係敵偽時期留用，查各機關僱員以下敵僞時期留用人員甚衆，勢不能一一裁汰，非獨上海監獄爲然，有此兩前提，其所控各節不盡不實之處甚多，地檢處對於此項密吿函並不過分重祖。</p>
<p>又上海監獄當局，十七日函中央社上海分社，對囚犯密呈市參會揭發內幕六則，言所聲明，並謂本監爲中外觀瞻所緊，一切辦理，均須依法執行，該犯楊開壽等不慣受此拘束，乃妄誣指摘，淆亂聽聞，影響本監名譽猶小，傳諸國際轉載，關係頗大云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海氣象台台長鄭子政辭職，中央氣象局派南京氣象總台長盧監（見圖）繼任，已於昨日正式接事。盧氏前在中央研究院研究氣象多年，曾任浙大敎授。去年八月赴美出席國際氣象會議，甫於最近返國。</p>
<p>據談我區氣象測報工作，由於經費窘竭，較美國相去甚遠。美全國氣象測站有七百五十處，我國現僅有一百十八處，且因電訊設備簡陋，經常能測報者僅約八十處。美全國測空氣球有一百五十站，我國現僅三十八站，其中經常測報者約僅四份之一。氣象測報之準確程度，全視測站之多寡及傳遞情報之快慢而定，故在我國目前之物力下，欲求氣象預測百分之百準確，實屬不可能。現中央氣象局特別注重上海方面之氣象測報工作，決從加强技術着手，盡力求其準確，以保障空運海運之安全。</p>

<p>予　志出團，目標有二：一爲訪求良醫割治三十年來聽途障塞之耳疾；一爲研究歐美各國戰後復員之建設，甫度民國三十六年元且，寒梅乍吐，南浦澄波，趁「戈登將軍」號，由申江橫渡太平洋，踏入新大陸。諸務調理之後，乃得價此行首要目的，治療耳疾。醫者以最新發明之手術，由左耳鑽小洞，直達聽神經。當中樞神經失馭時，天地昏黑，乾坤逆轉。閱時五月，聽覺雖復，頭尙微暈。時醫者他適避暑，囑予及時旅行，以散心而益智。乃乘內子菊芳哥倫比亞大學暑假之暇，約爲傳譯，共作歐遊。先後經英，挪，瑞，（典）丹，荷，比，盧，捷，意，摩，法，德，及瑞士等十三國。觀諸邦歷史遺跡，社會現象，與夫戰後措施，足供吾人借鏡者頗多。承各地使領館與友邦人士及僑胞同仁之多方協助，股細款接，用能以最經濟之時間，作較深入之探討，厚誼盛情，至足感荷。旣回紐約，稍獲餘閒，爰草歐陸紀遊，就正當世，藉以報專導視察之一得，且示衷心之感慰。醫謂耳疾仍須續治，一俟耳聽常淸，當竟全美之遊；時苟我許，再爲美陸紀遊以就正於高明。（中華民國三十六年十二月廿五日李漢魂於紐約）</p>
<p>瑪麗皇后</p>
<p>時當八月，驕陽閃爍；下午三時，踏上停泊於紐約九十號碼頭之「瑪麗皇后」（Queen　Mary），承諸親友走送，驥歌頻唱別感撩人，四時起碇，離開人烟稠密大廈摩大之鬧市，駛入水天一色之大洋中。海大寥廓，淸風入懷，半年以來，日處塵囂環境中養病，至此如入仙境。與菊芳披襟散髮，元立船頭，久警胸懷。至此有飄飄欲仙之概。</p>
<p>同船國人有曾昭掄敎授及甘光儀母子。昭掄爲名化學專家，先予來美，現應英國文化團體之聘，赴英講學，數千哩外，同舟共濟，話舊研新，旅中寂寥。破除不少。　「瑪麗皇后」爲世界最快之船，由美赴英，尙爲戰後之第二次。凡八萬二千五百噸，其大僅次於其姊妹船「伊利沙伯」，職工九百餘人。客位分三等，頭二等客房各七百位，三等各位八百。自紐約至英倫，頭等票價四百九十五美元，因其位置及設備而酌有增减，單房則須七百四十三元，二等自二百五十元起，三等自一百六十元起。船凡十層，即I.Sun　Deck,　2.　prornenape,　3.Main　Deck,　4.　A.　Deck,　5.　B.Deck　6.　R.　Deck,　7.　C.　Deck,　8.　D.　Deck,　9.　E.　Deck,10.　F.　Deck，望台及底艙尙未計人。電梯分十二級，除大餐廳，吸烟室，酒吧間，休息室，盥洗室，理　室等一般設備外，尙有圖書館，寫作室，攝影室，羽球塲，彈子房，乒乓台，影戲院，雜貨店，郵局，電報局，海關，移　局，醫院，游泳池，太陽浴塲，兒童遊樂塲，養狗塲等，規　宏麗，應有盡有；使旅客登此海　大廈，如入五都之市，有賓至如歸之感。</p>
<p>船上時光，尤易消逝。自朝至夕，正餐品茗，間隔以時，遊戲誤樂，各隨所好安排妥當，使人渾忘旅途之寂寥。</p>
<p>頭等臥室設備，有如紐約頭等旅館之規模，傢具被褥，精美非常。房間雖較通常旅館爲小，但玲瓏精巧，値得留戀，頭等餐廳，可容三百餘位，侍役百五十人，二客一僕，充分表現英國貴族氣派；晚餐多着禮服，燕尾招展，文質彬彬；婦女則長袍袒胸，亦英國貴族婦女之風度。二三等住室餐廳雖設備較遜，然甚整潔。</p>
<p>移民局在船上辦入境手續，比之到三藩市時在船畔鵠立守候者方便得多。美國人喜學英國人之長處，獨美國移民局於此不能效法英人，而常使到美之外國人尤其中國人到岸時，感受不少麻煩。</p>
<p>一路風平浪靜，使予回憶與橫渡太平洋之時，一樣安適。其實此行亦因船大力猛足以鎭定風濤。在船上度五晝夜，不惟未感到任何不舒適，且覺船行太快，靜室冥想，此後恐不易再有機會乘此世界最偉麗船舶，容與於萬頃汪洋中，欣賞此海上繁華與幸福。戰後世界經濟如此蕭條，英倫亦甚艱苦，但瑪麗輪猶能保留當年之舞貴，足見世界固多矛盾，而英人戰前海上稱雄，姿態及其擅長商戰技巧，于此可見一斑。　第五日晚十時，船抵英倫南部碼頭，（Southampton）。遙望太晤士河畔，燈光掩映，市影模糊，打破數日來海　靜寂空氣，呈露旅客到達目的地之緊張情緒。</p>
<p>踏入英倫</p>
<p>離別「　麗皇后」，踏上英陸，晤大使館來員，知火車及旅館供已定就。旋火車開行，遙見兩旁農舍，風物依稀。進入市區，斷壁頹垣，戰時痕迹，猶可辨識。車坻倫敦市滑鐵爐站，住Mount　Royal）旅店。摒擋稍就，展開地圖，與　芳共研兩週遊覽計劃。</p>
<p>至大使館訪候鄭茀庭大使，暢敍別情，並及國內外大勢，對於英國社會現狀及最近措施，尤爲中心談料。午晚兩餐，俱在使館。餐後出遊，日間由弗庭派員相陪，晚間由伊親自偕往。第一日先就市區作走馬式之巡禮，爾後擇要再度參觀。東道情股，至可　感。</p>
<p>在大使館參觀孫總理蒙難紀念室，壁間懸孫先生林故主席及康德黎等像。胡展堂詩及郭泰祺敍述經過，室中床椅用具均爲當時原物。回憶當時公使為　照瑗，計誘總理者爲鄧廷鑑，向康德黎報吿者爲館役英人柯爾夫婦，義使奸佞，浮現腦海。十二日之　囚，爲中國革命　留不可磨滅之紀念。徘徊不忍遽去，如見總理精神猶昭示吾人以履險如夾，革命者終當戰勝之偉大精神。</p>
<p>仰覩矗立天空之　爾遜紀念碑，如見納氏當年擊敗拿翁之偉蹟；次見埃及石柱，似象徵古代東方文化早已移植於英倫三島；復次見到雜處街市而無甚特色之白金漢宮及雄峙宮前之維多利亞女王紀念碑，抑大不列顚之王權之能保持勿替，殆因其接近羣衆歟？旋至西門寺大敎堂。堂爲大築，規模宏大。歷代王后，名人，貴族，多埋骨於此。一代文豪莎士比亞亦卓然立像，英人殆以此自傲于世界文壇耶？內有一室須購票而入英王之棺像在焉。歷代王朝加免之寳應，巳陳舊不堪，殆以此故示其爲故國世家耶？　到聖保羅大敎堂，空穹圓頂，仰望眼花。歷代名人，多埋骨留像於此。地下有室，置像尤多。威靈吞尤栩栩有生氣。室之右側爲此次大戰時德機炸毀，現正募款修建。</p>
<p>參觀大英博物館，輝煌矞麗，美不勝收。登樓即見所陳我國古物甚多，計大銅鐘三，石獸二，壁畫及佛像數輻，銅鼎景泰藍鼎銅香案等多種，中古土物，胡爲乎流落在此，刺目驚心，不堪逼視。此外尙陳有希臘羅馬及近東各國古物。因時間短促，且精神感受激刺，未多詳觀，即行離表。</p>
<p>到臘像館，像甚逼真，遊人雜於其中，幾難辨其孰眞孰假。二樓各室，多以同類分置。英國歷代王后及名相名將多有像，拿破崙，華盛頓，羅斯福，斯太林，邱吉爾等各設有專室。三樓多各項故事，且有希特勒像。最後在　害　見有古代酷刑及犯罪陳設，惻然心悸。</p>
<p>海　公園爲鬧市之淸凉界，亦為政爭之熱　州塲。因左寓所附近，故常出入經視。每見站於小木箱上之講演者，鼓舌奮臂（雜以聽衆鼓掌或吁吁之聲）大而國黨大計，小而里巷民隱，莫不暢所欲言，甚且激昂爭辯。且絕不受任何干涉，匪特保持紳士風度，抑亦表現民主作風，殊堪取則。</p>
<p>匆匆窺見倫敦之一角，古氣盎然，特以晝間多濃務，晚上十時以前街上多已人車俱寂。初由紐約來此，不免有點感冷落之感。英國在西方大國中歷史校長，然自東方古國之遊者看來，並不能激發油然思古之情。若自美國角度看來，則相形老邁矣。</p>
<p>巡視東區</p>
<p>由大使館介紹市參議員某君，引導騙車至此次大戰被炸最劇之東倫敦區。是日天氣分外黯淡，一路東行，漸增苦趣，倫敦本有貧富區域之分，東區貧而西區富，德機之光顧東區特多者，蓋德軍轟炸目標，以破壞交通運輸爲主，東區接近碼頭與運輸中心昆隣，貧民因而遭殃特甚。倫敦分爲廿八區，東區約有三十萬人口。戰時倫敦被炸死者約八萬人，此區受害者幾達三分之一。刦灰未泯，令予回憶主粵時敵機炸後搶救災民之景象。惟彼已「泰來」，我將何似！先觀十六世紀依利沙伯女王木屋；後看十八世紀貴族所住之街市。至大倫敦市內之倫敦市區（London　City）北包括於大市中一方哩之範圍。因大市乃由此小市發展而來，故保留以爲紀念。市長在此區域內地位甚高，首相相見，須爲禮讓，英王入城，須得其允許，初入此區，即見古老之市長官邸，矗立街口，國家銀行，對峙其前。小城有門，出入由之，今廢置不用，殘迹猶存。</p>
<p>參觀一〇六六年開始興建之倫敦堡，雖已失去原來作用，但矗立於太晤士河畔，不特城堞依然，且中藏甚多之古兵器，幷陳列歷代王冠。雄風劍氣，令人想見帝王與武士之相輔相成。見第一次大　海軍紀念鐵碑，令人想起當日英　海軍之雄姿。東倫敦大道面積寬闊，以磚砌成，令人想起耙元前五十餘年羅馬佔領時舊跡。江山依舊，人物更新，歷史無情，誰能遺此？</p>
<p>英國人之規模與氣魄確屬不少。當此經濟極度困難之時，在東倫敦廢墟之上，已有整個計劃，築成數十幢由兩層至　層之平民住宅。其辦法凡被炸民屋之無力自建及合乎公用者，概由公家收買。收買及建築費用，則就地方稅及由國家補助擔當，此種新屋，優先租與新婚者，有病者，及退伍軍人家屬。入室參觀數戶，客廳浴室及煤汽暖汽等，設備俱全。嗣觀其區立託兒所，專收一月至五歲之兒童，每日收費一先令，每週由公家補助一磅半。倫敦成人所得牛奶之分配最甚少，兒童則極充足。加以該所設備完好，管理周到，兒童俱極肥碩而快樂。菊芳因受社會部託，調查兒童福利事業，對此特加留意。</p>
<p>參觀中國埠，據聞在倫敦者二千餘僑胞，前多聚居於此；其中以毒，為多。炸後雖極着索，但僑胞仍苦笑相迎。海　工會及正義工商會在此。域該會負責人顧根福君談現海員工會有千餘人，時來時去；其工資除住食外，每月由十二磅至十八磅，其工作以燒火打掃及侍役水手爲多。生活頗苦。此次大戰，各國船隻因被迫而　集於此，葉僑因服務而犧牲者，約三萬人，亦云列矣。</p>
<p>東倫敦區之貧民窟，曾爲世界人士所注目。百年前有牛津劍橋兩大學敎授學久居此區，調查貧民生活，幷求改善之方。馬克思無產階級革命運動之理論，多取材於此。英國費邊社之勃興，亦造端於此。兩者俱屬社會主義。其不同處：馬克思認爲從資本主義到共產主義，必須採取暴力革命，且須經過無產階級專政之階段；費邊社則認爲從資本主義到社會主義，可用理智說服，可循代議制度達到目標，不必流血，後者即今日英國工電理論蜜施之來源，遊畢返　，東倫敦區慘炸　與社會進化史實，滿注腦海，盤旋不停，澈夜不能安睡，起床翻讀民生主義第三講。東方破曉，方始入夢。</p>

<p>〔本報台北十一日訊〕據甫自美國返雀之夏之驊氏語記者：美人對台灣問題至感興趣，並深表關懷。戰時普林斯頓大學曾由海軍設立台灣研究所，受訓員生數達二千餘人，當時曾擬有盟軍登陸後全般接收之詳細計劃，勝利後台灣歸入中國，此項計劃即未能實現。目前在美大學申設有研究台灣機構者，計西雅圖華盛頓大學，內有遠東系，系主任爲在歐洲研究東方問題之專家，曾任台灣美副領事之寇爾（G.Kerr.），亦爲被聘之短期敎授，渠主講日本史及台灣史，以在台勾留時間較久，並親歷二二八事件，故提供有關台灣之資料甚多。惟感遺憾者渠所發表之台灣論題，似存有偏見，未能盡客觀報導事實之責，渠對來合之內地工作人員，甚至有所侮辱，夏氏曾以私人資格出席由寇爾所召集之座談會，就其所提若千問題，大部均存異見，均經夏氏據實答復。另一研究台灣之機構，則為哈佛大學之中國岡書館，內分日本，台灣及中國邊疆各項研究，對西藏及新疆邊陲各省研究綦詳，對台灣則研究高山族之語言，人種來源，就民族學人類學對散處深山間八八七四八人，作純學理的研討，彼等並擬派專家來台實地考察，希與本省著名學家共同研究，發掘，又曾在濟華大學執敎之李教授，亦在該校參加研究。此兩大學之設有臺灣專題講座，具足見盟邦人士對台灣關切之情。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局長李熙謀定於今日中午，在國際飯店設席公宴全國天主敎敎育會議出席代表，市府沈秘書長屆時將代表吳市長參加。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕星期二爲全國天主敎敎育會議之第三日，仍在上海長樂路震旦女子文理學院大禮業舉行。上午由漢口上智中學校長李道南演講「公敎學校之經濟」，上海敎區敎育委員會襲品梅演講「敎職員在敎學上道德上宗敎上應有之條件。」下午，由徐匯中學校長張伯達演講「男校中之社會敎育」，啓明女校校長周維城演講「女校中之社會敎育」，語均警闢。</p>
<p>明公開會議　星期三之大會，由敎育部社會敎育司長英千里講述「公敎對於社會敎育之貢獻」。星期四下午，始舉行公開會議。</p>
<p>「又訊」漢口上智中學校長李道南，就公敎敎育前途，對記者發表談話如下：天主敎以敎化萬民爲目的，在敎化萬民的方策中，以中國目前情形而論，最妥善切實者，莫過於開辦學校，每一所學校即是最好之據點。通過這個據點，隨時隨地都給予宣揚敎義，敎化人類之機會。但敎化功能所發揮之程度，就要以學校敎育之優劣去決定。爲要收穫敎化人類使命上高度之效果，公敎敎育，不但在質的方面要求其加重分量，在量的方面尤其是要求其增加數字。根據一九四七年上海出版之中國傳敎區年鑑記載：公敎之初級小學，共有二千二百九十八所，高小共有三百四十所，初高中共有一百廿八所，大學共有三所，此一統計數字與中國一百四十個敎區四百萬信友之數字作比例，即說明公敎學校在量的方面委實太少，更何况公敎敎育之對象不僅是少數敎友之子女，必須達在敎外之靑年與兒童，故在量的方面必須要加多。</p>
<p>恢復基金制　目前公教學校之維持，百分之百是仰賴於學費收入，在通貨膨脹與物價與日俱增威脅之下，僅靠學費收入，能否繼續維持是一個極大問題，因此爲鞏固學校之生存，必須另設他法。其法就個人之主張，最好是恢復基金制度。不過有基金制度以後，還得善於運用。遝用之方法，莫善於每所中學，附設一所醫院，以其盈餘，供給中學開支，不但中學獲得經濟之支持，且醫院本身，亦是一個傳敎據點，對於敎化萬民，可有雙重意義。此外天主敎敎務協進委員會，亦應籌劃鉅款，補助各地成績優良之中小學，帮助缺乏學校或未有學校之敎區開辦中小學。</p>
<p>分佈教學綱　在經濟問題有解決途徑以後，應建立一個公敎學校敎學網。敎育網之分佈，至少每一個本堂區或一個大會所，至少成立正式初級小學一所，每一總鐸區，至少成立正式高小一所，每一主敎區至少成立正式男女二部之初級中學一所，每一敎省區至少成立正式男女二部之高中一所。此外，並在華中，華西，華南，及東北各設立大學一所。如果公敎敎育經濟有充分把握，公敎敎育網如能建立，我想三百餘年以來，天主敎在中國傳敎之效果，不難立即更加顯著與發皇。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕成立未久之中國解剖學會，因國人狃於習俗，死後不願將屍骨供作解剖，且亦爲法律所不許，遂使目前我國醫學敎育所需之試驗解剖屍骨，極感缺乏，各大學及研究院所均苦無以應事實上迫切需要，將備文員請行政院及教育部速謀補救並將擬定辦法向立法院建議，請予立法。該會負責人盧于道敎授談：醫學院之試驗解剖屍骨，關係醫學敎育至鉅。就渠所知，今日各大學醫學院當局，無不爲此問題焦慮。戰前北平協和醫學院所用之試驗解剖屍骨，係由南京金陵大學借用，戰後金陵大學亦感缺乏，日前各校多由國防醫學院借用，然爲數甚少，不敷供應。盧氏認爲此固由於我國未經立法使然，雖無主棄屍，仍不得作為試驗解剖之用。而我國一般習俗，本人及其家屬不願死後分屍，實爲最大大原因。盧氏稱：試驗解剖，分爲生理與病理兩種，西洋人士病死，多遺囑家屬請醫解剖，藉以明瞭其病理所在，以個人已死之身，供獻於醫藥敎育，其裨益於社會後世之精神，足爲我國矜式，亟應提倡之。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨因產區米價報漲，市塲陷於混亂狀態，正式交易在檳持中均未做開。塲外喊價超出二百萬關，社會局在市塲以一百七十五萬之價，在南北市場各拋出五千石。吳市長急電行政院張院長及糧部兪部長，請速籌緊急對策，飭江蘇省政府及無錫縣政府方面，從速抑平產地米價。</p>
<p>據悉：無錫產地米價，前日下午已至一百九十六萬，其所以如此上漲，係有徐州客人在該地大量收購之故。收購數量以火車列車計，每車可裝米十五噸左右，共有十車。吳市長昨曾以長途電話與無錫徐縣長聯絡，請抑平當地價格。徐縣長即坐鎭當地米市塲，並將收購之十　食米攔下，無錫當地米價限一百六十五萬元。本市一二日內亦即可望平息。</p>
<p>米商要求抑平產價</p>
<p>吳市長昨日下午曾召見米商談話，米商要求抑平產地價格。吳市長表示已請中央及產地政府，採取此項措置。希望米商能與政府合作，市塲交易不超過一百八十萬。吳市長並因政府拋米可能全被米商吸收團積，正研究拋米技術問題，將於今日發表談話。</p>
<p>社局拋米一日萬石</p>
<p>又訊：吳市長昨晚向記者表示：此次食米漲風，純係受產米區價格波動影響，吳市長昨特請求中央，速即令各產區設法控制米價。市府方面，仍今肚會局繼續日拋一萬石應市。又吳市長昨召集米商談話時，米商表示，彼等　設法使米値穩定，並保證米價可不超過一百九十八萬元云。</p>
<p>雜糧麵粉跟踵狂升</p>
<p>又訊：昨食米塲外價格升騰更速，貨主均堅持不脫，造成緊張　面。白粳創二百〇五萬元之新高價，羊秈及簿稻均已抵二百萬大關。</p>
<p>麵粉猛漲不已，市上有進無出，塲外少數交易，價猛漲八九萬元。老車粉一度曾見九十萬元之高峯。鈇皮甫開即吿漲停，大包鈇四十八萬八千元，後塲外高至五十一萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧直綫飛升，黃豆價再漫漲，乍豆最後一百三十萬元，杜豆上漲十五至二十萬元，芝蔴　勁漲二十萬元，　豆本街及靑島帮均納，躍升二十萬。紅糧挺五萬至十萬，揀靑終昂十萬元，獨苞米市價平平。</p>
<p>食油受米價及各糧上漲影響，廠方無意開出，買賣雙方擯持至收市才稍有開出，豆油初市曾喊高至四百五十萬元，尙乏售戶，後廠商應需要稍有開出，市乃轉平，後市低至四百四十萬元，終仍軋漲二十萬。生熟菜油均升二十餘萬，小車蔴油狂升六十五萬元之鉅，豆餅亦挺約一二萬。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕日來紗布市况，因銀根鬆濫，趨勢堅挺。中國紡建公司爲調劑供需，農曆新正後，仍積極拋售紗布。除昨日售出之紗布不計外，十四日計售布四三一七〇疋，價値六六，四四〇，八〇〇元；十六日售紗，計掛牌售出一五二三件，價値八，一一九，六五八萬元。市塲售出一四三五件，價値六，九〇〇，〇〇〇萬元。又同日售出呢絨，價値一，六二〇，〇〇〇萬元。兩日間售出紗布呢絨，總値二三二八。三億元云。</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開穩定，嗣因業外游資活動，喊便復見上升。中途紡建公司雖仍掛牌，接受同業申請，市氣稍軟。不久，即以本客帮實需尙佳，人心大都看好。價又回高，四十二支藍鳳細紗竟價出七二萬大關，至七千零六十萬元新高峰。收盤較之上日續漲一百六十萬元。廿一支　馬現貨，各方吸納甚夥，做高至四千六百七十萬元，再升二百四十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，均步升七八十萬　一百萬左右不一。</p>
<p>紗管會昨繼續委託紡建公司在紗業公會售紗，售紗總數在一千一百件左右，合廿支紗約一七〇〇件。各檔廿支紗價自四二〇〇萬元至四四〇〇萬元不等，准購單當日不及塡發，將延至今晨九時，方能發出云。</p>
<h3 id="c152">紗商要求加佣市場一度停頓 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>棉紗市塲，昨晨一度停市，故各支紗價，直至中午始行開出。據悉停市原因，係爲棉紗交易中，紗商居間人之佣金問題。按廠商及客帮買賣棉紗，須委託紗商居間人至市塲內成交。紗商則於買賣數量內抽取佣金，佣金計算，前經規定廿支紗每件爲五萬元，廿支以上者自十萬元至廿萬元不等。但因邇來物價上漲，棉紗買賣價格亦日鉅，故紗商均感原定佣金數量過微。况委託買賣數量，日見零員，日常成交僅數包爲單位，佣金收入更見微細。昨日開市前，紗商一致表示，須增加佣金一倍，始肯開做交易，而對方尙不能表示接受，致談判陷入僵局，紗市延至十一時半猶未開做。後經雙方諒解，決定先行恢復交易後，再行談判，始於近午時開始成交云。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開以銀根仍見鬆濫，客帮與同業拉提甚勁，染廠對低檔細布吸胃甚强，塲內買氣濃郁，行情迂廻土升。惟至十點後，因紡建公司掛脾，開售龍頭細布，人心頓吿疲軟，散戶恐市勢不振，了結甚多，北帮亦有少數吐出，霎時頓呈有供乏求之勢，行情亦見微挫。迨至午收，人心依然興奮，本街門市進取不絕，故結果僅龍頭細布，較上日回跌四萬元，爲二百零三萬元，低檔五福彩球振中等細布，因廠需不惡，續漲自二萬至十五萬元。全日趨勢，以四君子嗶嘰直貢市氣較疲外，其餘各布市勢依然挺俏。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會對發展出口業，異常重視，現已考慮作資金貸款之援助。據悉：今後對出口業之貸助，分爲三個階段，出口物資在產地未運出以前，可作抵押借款，此爲第一階段。從產地運至出口口岸，可改作國內押匯，此爲第二階段。出從口口岸運往國外，則做打句放款，此爲第三階段。俾出口商獲得政府資金，在其產，運，銷之過程中，均可循環運用。但限於絲，茶，桐油，猪鬃等重要出口物資，且國外確有固定銷塲者。輸管會正草擬具辦法，最近期內，即可討論實施。</p>

<p>人造絲昨市下降，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤跌進一億元關內，人心頗軟，交易極淸。中午收盤喊九千八百萬元，下午最大升至一億元關外，終因供求失勻，最後仍降至九千八百萬元，天橋東洋等均隨之而挫落。</p>
<p>廠經昨市稍軟，C字等級同行有五包交易，價做一億〇三百萬元，開口貨五担頭D字身份，實銷有十包成交，價做一億元，與上日行情相同。另祖並無做開，干經亦乏成交，喊價均無變化。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市挫跌，因人心虛軟，華强眞絲被面開市即降至六百萬元關內，嗣後呈盤旋狀態。收市做六百二十萬元，大誠格子璧縐先降至十九萬元關內，收市做十九萬二千元。華錦縐及羽紗等均小三四千元不等，其他各貨，喊價大都未更。</p>

<p>昨浙貨帮元胡索上檔貨開六萬，旋以拆兌帮觀望，始回小至四萬成交，下檔次貨二萬六，成交微稀。麥冬最高價爲十四萬元，下檔包面四萬四，尙稱平穩。西　　果，統貨六萬元，頗有成交</p>

<p>— 張道</p>
<p>二〇·難民醫院大門</p>
<p>貴陽第一難民醫院大門前。若干看病人出出入入。一輛紅十字會的救護車開到。（這種車，祗不過是有蓬子的大卡車而已。）醫院的執事人們。立即出來。將車裏面的傷病難民。先後移出。初移出來的是一個受傷的鄉下老婦。其次移出來的是一位重病的大學敎　模樣的讀書人。由他的妻子扶着下車。入醫院去。最後移出來的是一憫年約八歲的女孩，（即何秀貞）腿部受了傷。還在昏　狀　中。</p>
<p>二一·養病室</p>
<p>傷病的人一個個移入了醫院的養病室裏以後。接着醫生李濟人和女醫生鄭敬業（此刻敬業巳經是三十三四歲了。）帶着護士走入病房。先　視了大學敎授。再診視一下年老的鄉婦·忽然在病室一角，病床上的女病人·慘呼疼痛。並且大呌「我的丈夫來了沒有？」醫生們和其他的病者，傷者，都不免發生了一陣驚擾。鄭醫生立即過去安慰她·李醫生和看護却走到受傷女孩的病床前去。女孩痛苦地呻吟着·李醫生去打開她包扎着的腿看看·這時鄭醫生也走了過去一同診視·</p>
<p>濟人：（對敬業說·）這孩子的腿傷很　。已經腫得很厲害。非開刀不可。</p>
<p>敬業：是的。馬上就給她施手術。</p>
<p>濟人：　你通知手術室趕快準備？</p>
<p>敬業；好的。</p>
<p>二二·手術室</p>
<p>第一難民醫院手術室的門打開。一架移動　病床。　方才施過手術的何秀貞由裏面推出來。李醫生身上還穿着施手術時所穿的衣服。左手上還戴一隻皮手套。嘴上的口罩還沒有取下來。鄭醫生也穿着同樣的衣服，不過手套口罩已經取下。李醫生站在手術室門的裏面。看着鄭醫生和護士將移動病床推入一間單人小病房內去。</p>
<p>敬業：（親近的注視着小孩。小孩的雙眼閉着。很苦痛酌樣子。鄭醫生嘆氣說。）唉！眞可憐！</p>
<p>護士；不曾成殘疾吧？</p>
<p>敬業：大概不會的。讓她睡腄吧。</p>
<p>（醫生和護士輕着脚步出去了。）</p>
<p>二三·小房病室</p>
<p>（三十三年十二月底）</p>
<p>過了相當的日子。秀貞（秀貞此刻已經是八歲了。）的腿傷漸漸的好了。人也很淸醒了。正在一間單人小病房裏的床上翻着一本畫報。敬業走入病室。</p>
<p>秀貞：（女孩看見鄭醫生進來，微笑着。）鄭先生。</p>
<p>敬業：不再痛了吧？</p>
<p>秀貞：謝謝您，不痛了。（微笑，忽又愁苦的。）鄭先生，我會不會成一個跛子？</p>
<p>敬業。祗要你聽我的話，好好的休養，一定不會跛的。</p>
<p>秀貞：我一定聰您的話。</p>
<p>敬業：你現在想得起以前的許多事來了吧？</p>
<p>秀貞：我想得起了。</p>
<p>敬業：你是姓何，名字呌秀貞嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：是的。</p>
<p>敬業：你今年幾歲？</p>
<p>秀貞：八歲。</p>
<p>敬業；你家在那裏，你爸爸媽媽時甚麽名字？</p>
<p>秀貞：我家在上海，我媽媽呌做郭燦雲。我爸爸呌何琦。</p>
<p>敬業：（聽了何琦之名，甚爲驚異。忽而稍大聲的。）甚麽？何琦？</p>
<p>秀貞：（有點奇怪的望着她·）是的。</p>
<p>敬業：你有兄弟姐妹嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：沒有，一個也沒有。（敬業聽了此點稍一沉思。）</p>
<p>敬業：你怎麼會到貴州來的呢？</p>
<p>秀貞：媽媽告訴我，上海打仗以後，我們就搬到挂林去住。後來爸爸到新加坡去了。一直沒有回來。前一向媽媽說，日本兵要到挂林了。就帶起我逃跑。後來我們的東西，丟的丟了，搶的給人搶了。我們先還有車子坐的，後來車子也沒有了。媽媽就帶着我跟着很多很多的人走路。有一天走到一個地方。有警報。我和媽媽跟着人家逃警報。人太多了。把我們衝散了。接着炸彈轟轟轟的炸起來。以後的事，我就不知道了。（秀貞說到此哭了。（媽媽也不知道到那兒去了。（說完更哭了。）</p>
<p>敬業（很親切的安慰秀貞。）你不用哭。我們給你託人到各個難民所去打聽你媽媽的消息了</p>
<p>秀貞：（拉着敬業的手懇求的問。）您一定找得到我的媽媽</p>
<p>敬業：我想會找得到的。</p>
<p>二四·鄭醫生辦公室</p>
<p>（三十四年二月）</p>
<p>鄭醫生在醫院的辦公室內。敬業正在辦公桌上拿着一張小孩的像片出神。（這張像片就是當年敬業出院時取了收在手皮包內的·）（用特寫）一面看着像。一面回想着秀貞的面貌。（回映以前的鏡頭。）忽然李濟人醫生帶着社會服務處一位奏明先生進來。敬業即將照片夾在一本書裏</p>
<p>濟人：鄭先生，這位是社會服務處的秦先生。他來和你談談關於何秀貞的事。</p>
<p>敬業：秦先生請坐，李先生也請坐。（他們都坐在敬業辦公室桌的對面。）</p>
<p>秦明：鄭先生，我們在所有的難民所裏都查問過，報上難民服務攔裏也登載了許多天的啓事，始終沒有何秀貞母親的下落。</p>
<p>敬業：，那也沒有辦法，這孩子現在傷好了。天天在念着她的媽媽。吹！這孩子眞是可憐。以後出了醫院，又怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>秦明：我今天正要和你們兩位商量這件事。</p>
<p>敬業：您打算怎麼安置她呢</p>
<p>秦明：我們現在打算送她到重慶蔣夫人辦的戰時兒童保育院去。</p>
<p>敬業：啊！（似乎驚訝而有不贊同之意。）</p>
<p>秦明：鄭先生，你以爲怎樣</p>
<p>敬業：（對李秦二人說。）我們呌秀貞來問問她好嗎？</p>
<p>李　秦：好的。</p>
<p>敬業：（按辦公桌上的鈴子，一個護士進來。）謂你去帶何秀貞到這兒來。</p>
<p>濟人：這孩子非常可愛，最好有人肯收養她。</p>
<p>秦明：要是平時，許多人都會要。在這種情况之下，恐怕不容易找得合適的人收養她。</p>
<p>（護士抱着秀貞進來，放下立在地上。她手裏拿着小小的手杖。可以慢步走了。）</p>
<p>敬業：秀貞，你能慢慢的走過來嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：唔。（大家注視着她慢慢的走到敬業身邊。）</p>
<p>敬業。秦先生，請你告訴她吧·</p>
<p>秦明：小妹妹我們還沒有找着你的媽媽。你的傷快好了。這裏病人多得很。我們打算送你到重慶兒童保育院去。你媽媽將來會到那裏去找你的。</p>
<p>秀貞：看着大家不敢回答。接着大哭起來。）不！我不去！甚麽地方我都不去！找不着媽媽，我就跟着鄭先生。（緊緊抱着敬業·）</p>
<p>敬業：（大爲感動。）跟着我？（看着李秦二人。）</p>
<p>秀貞：我願意跟着你，因爲你待我好。</p>
<p>敬業：我一天忙着照料病人，那裏有功夫來管你呢？</p>
<p>秀貞：我不搗亂，我聰話，我自己做我的飯吃，好不好？</p>
<p>敬業：（很受感動，笑笑。）你就不做飯給我吃嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：（很快的。）我做，我做。</p>
<p>（李秦二人相視而笑。好像有了新辦法似的。）</p>
<p>秦明：鄭先生，這孩子很可愛的。您要能收養她是很好的。</p>
<p>濟人：看這樣，恐怕鄭先生不答允也不行了。</p>
<p>敬業：秦先生，這孩子又可愛，又可憐。如果貴處認爲可以交給我收養，那麽暫時就由我收養她。等找到了她父母的時候，由我負責交給他們。</p>
<p>秦明：那好極了！就這樣辦</p>
<p>（秦告辭。由李陪同出去。敬業把秀貞抱在懷裏。護士在旁邊看着高興。）</p>
<p>二五·貴陽公路車站</p>
<p>（三十四年五月）</p>
<p>鄭敬業醫生辭去醫院的職務。帶着秀貞由貴陽到重慶。她們正在貴陽一個公路車站前面。一輛大公路汽車升火待發。她的同事李濟人等和幾位護士到車站送行。車上已經擠滿了人。車旁還有許多帶了行李上不了車的人。羨慕着已在車裏的人們。　敬業：（快開車時，對送行的人們。（謝謝詣位，再見吧。</p>
<p>（分別與送行的人一一握手道別。轉身呌秀貞。秀貞向大家告別。）</p>
<p>秀貞：（向送行的人鞠躬。）再見！再見！</p>
<p>護士：再見！秀貞！你不會忘記我吧？</p>
<p>秀貞：不會，趙姑姑！（好像要落淚的樣子。）</p>
<p>濟人：鄭先生，不要忘記通信哪。希望不久再相會。</p>
<p>敬業：（笑着對送客們。）需望抗戰快快勝利。我們能在南京見面更好了。（汽車司機催上車。）好！秀貞！上車。諸位再見！</p>
<p>敬業·秀貞：（擠入車門後，車就開行，二人向送行朋友招手）再見！</p>
<p>送行朋友們：再見！</p>
<p>公路汽車輪轉動。地下有一張殘破的標語寫　「日本帝國主義，』等字。車輪輾了過去。只剩下『日本』二字。</p>
<p>二六·重慶市街上A</p>
<p>（三十四年八月十日晚）標語：日本投降，中國萬歲！（O·S鞭砲聲）</p>
<p>此刻街上人山人海。大衆狂歡。許多大卡車，小轎車來往着。裏面都裝滿了人。盟軍也坐了吉普車出　。這裏那裏到處燃放砲竹。遊行的人都喜形於色。手舞足蹈。口中喊着『日本投降了！』『抗戰勝利了！』「中華民國萬歲！」「中國國民黨萬歲！」「擁護國民政府！」「蔣委員長萬歲！」等等口號。也有臨時紥成的各種大燈。上面寫着「慶祝抗戰勝利！」以及上述的各種口號作標語。一會兒鑼鼓喧天。耍大頭獅子的出來了。忽然又有市民聚集成行列，以鑼鼓爲先導，也接上來了。一隊軍樂隊軍樂揚揚的出現。後面一大隊武裝同志整隊遊行。許多吉普車上的盟軍帶着外國婦女或軍中婦女服務人員。一輛一輛的先後出現。盟軍們大都伸着大姆指，對中國民衆說「中國頂好！」「蔣委員長頂好！」民衆也報以「美國頂好！」「美軍頂好！」等語。</p>
<p>他們有的在車上，有的在走路。手裏拿着瓶喝酒。也有合唱着各種外國歌曲。許多民衆爭着和他們握手。等等熱烈情况。</p>
<p>二七·重慶市街上B</p>
<p>（三十四年九月三日下午）</p>
<p>陪都重慶慶祝日本投降之正式受降紀念。陪都人民之偉大遊行行列。</p>
<p>蔣委員長檢閱行列。受民眾歡呼。晚間慶祝的提燈會等等情况。鄭敬業携秀貞在道旁參觀。</p>
<p>敬業：秀貞你看見蔣委員長了嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：看見了。</p>
<p>敬業：他就是領導　中國人打敗日本的偉大領袖。</p>
<p>秀貞：我剛才向他敬禮，不知道他看見沒有。</p>
<p>敬業：他會看見的。秀貞我們快回上海去了，你高興嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：高興！坐飛機回上海！</p>
<p>敬業：對啦，坐飛機！</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>芭蕾書簡</p>
<p>在哈代葬後，巴蕾（James　MBarrie）寫了一封信給哈代夫人說：「我願意你知道，不僅哈代這個人偉大，使得我感到驚奇。倘若他不渦是一個平常的人—我仍舊認爲他是我所知道的最可愛的人之一。」這樣的話其實也可以用在巴蕾身上的。他的好朋友有梅生（A．E．W．Mason），奎勒可契（Quiller－Couch），史密斯（Turley　Smitn）現代寫小學生故事最好的作者），司各德（Scott以北極探險著名），卜里斯勒（J.B．Priestley），柳以士（EilunedLewis一九三四年巴蕾曾然誠地歡迎他的「草上露」）以及他那忠心的書記愛斯葵絲（Cynthia　Asquith）夫人。他們都說巴蕾是一個快樂的人；就是現在所出版的「巴蕾書簡」也很淸晰地顯出他是懂得快樂的，時常享有快樂，不管他的生活是如何的難受和煩惱。他說：「那些拿快樂給別人的人，不能把快樂留給他們自己。』他向愛斯葵絲夫人所說的話：「你不是大聲呼喊快樂的人，』也可以用在他自己身上。</p>
<p>他怎樣無止境的，愉快的，高興的給人快樂，也可以從道些書信裏看出來，年代包括一八八四年到一九三七年，可惜其中關涉他早年的作家生活之處甚少。最値得注意的就是所有的信全都有一點內容，並非不經心的事件的報告。</p>
<p>無疑地巴舊自以爲他是一個沉默的孩子。一九〇九年他寫信給奎勒可契道：「我幻想要爲我自己創造一個人工的世界，因爲我所住的眞實世界顯得太憂鬱了。我的筆是多末固執地想要尋求快樂呵！」他所稱讀的作家，除哈代外，大半都是愉快的作家。這些信裏談到書與作者的不多。他不大喜歡勞倫斯（D．H．Lowrence），說他的「失去的女孩」（The　Lost　Girl第一章過於生硬；他稱讚文字流利的作家和最好的說故事者。他說應該是寫出來的，不是硬做出來的。一八九三年他告訴奎勒可契說：『這就對了！因爲這是哈代自然的產物。的確這就是一切。可祝福的是這位小說家並不曾想到應該怎樣寫。「他又告訴愛斯葵絲，班蓀（Stella　Benson）的一本書太難懂了。『她是一位有腦筋的輝惶的人物，但她寫這本書有什麽主要目的，我簡直把握不住。」使我們失望的，是書信中談到他自己作品之處很多。他談到許多劇作，特別是「孩子大衛」（The　Boy　David）。</p>
<p>這本書簡的好處頗不易爲讀者所知，除非是熟知他的朋友們和他寫信的背景。</p>
<p>希望這本書能引起讀者研究巴蕾的興趣，更希望這本書能出續集。</p>
<p>小泉八雲的傳記</p>
<p>小泉八雲（Tafcadio　HearnB）是我們的熟人，他那「文學的解釋」，「詩人與詩」一類的書，明白曉暢，使你讀了不忍釋手。新近魏德克（Harry　E．Wedeck）寫了一本小泉八雲的傳記出版，名呌「致死的飢餓」（Mortal　Hunger）是一本小說式的傳記，用高度的熱情寫出來的。它不倦地踪跡小泉八雲每一步的行程，從希臘的島上通過巴黎和新奧爾良（New　Orleans）一直到日本。整個的行程小泉八雲都聽明地用潑墨給畫出强烈的色彩來。它是帶着眞摯情感寫出來的，不過動人還不深。但小泉八雲仍不失其爲光輝的個性，他是個大無畏的浪漫主義者。</p>
<p>他只有五尺高，永遠是一個外國人（到後來，最悲劇底的，他竟入了日本絡，他突然瞎了一隻眼。他理解寂寞。可惜他在日本不容易得到大量的參考書，因此就限制了他著作的精采。</p>
<p>小泉八雲把他的材料處理得很好，因爲他是一空倚傍的：例如中國的傳說（「幾個中國鬼」），新奧爾良的禮俗，英國和東印度的民俗以及各地的民間故事。</p>
<p>我們須分析一個作家的心理過程。要想理解一個作家，必須從裏面看到外面。魏德克所敍似尚嫌膚淺。我們不需要書目式的羅列，必須說出某一部書是怎樣產生的，怎樣寫作的，在寫作時作者有什麽感想。這些魏德克都還不曾做到。</p>
<p>魏德克似乎在敍述時不肯大步跨去，每每溫和地退縮。例如寫小泉八雲可怕而又奇怪的個人生活，他對於一目喪明所受的刺激很大。他接近一個女人，但魏德克竟不肯說下去，把幕拉了起來。我們所要知道的是小泉八雲在高度情感時對於這事件的反應，現在却被緊裏在小說傳記者的沉默裏，那不是大爲減色麽？但我們却終於幸運地看到了深厚同情筆下的敏感的靈魂。他永久追求，永久流浪，多做手勢多說話，帶一點愚蠢，大半都是出於至誠，他是感覺的冒險者。倘若魏德古能更客觀地處理這傳記，大約他的成就還要更大一些，他還有更多緊要的話要說吧。</p>

<p>所以要禁舞之故，報載是爲的「節約」。節約點什麼？節約氣力嗎？跳舞的人恐怕是費力的，但節約了下來呌他們與她們移作那一種別用呢？火家失業，對國家社會又有何好處？節約金錢嗎？那更是大可不必。以個人言，節省用錢是應該的，但國家之厲行節約，目的應該在於怕銷耗浪費掉難得的物炎，譬如說，汽油所存無幾了，命令上海從市長起停坐汽車一星期，存煤不多了，關照各機關停生火爐　停燒水汀兩禮拜，……這是眞正的節約，大有益於國家，因爲這些東西都是越用越少，又不能用後仍在的。人民袋裏的鈔票則不然，舞客用之，舞女與舞塲職工得之，其總數必不缺一元一角，儘管他們去交易而退，各得其所，根本上又於國家何損？</p>
<p>所以從節約——眞正有助於國計的節約——而言，跳舞無禁止之必要。如果說舞塲裏不免賣洋酒洋烟，舞女不免搽洋脂洋粉，就必浪費外匯，那麼可否讓我建議：眞爲節約外匯計，請將外國電影先行禁映，或至少與禁舞同時實行。</p>
<p>最後聲明：本人生平不跳一舞，家人戚友中亦無依跳舞爲生者，故反對禁舞純出大公，毫無私意，正如主張禁舞諸公的並非因跳舞吃過虧而出此，確係至誠爲國者一樣。</p>

<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>喜　與烏鴉，同是其貌不揚的小鳥兒，喜鵲就靠着它唱得婉轉動聽，討人歡喜，所以被人目爲可愛的動物，　烏鴉縱有黑得發亮的羽毛，却因爲往往不識趣地呱呱亂呌，便被當作不祥之物，故而永遠受不到主人的靑睞和賞賜，人總是喜　替自己歌功頌德的，又有那個犯賤的專喜歡聽人不入耳的聒噪和咒駡？</p>
<p>譬如這幾天新春佳節，誰也想圖個吉利，去年運氣壞的巴望從此交進好運道，去年過得去的也巴望今年百尺竿頭更進一步，　是日常見面的家人同事，碰着了開口第一句話不再是「活不下去」，「柴米汕鹽」等的喪氣話，而換上了「恭喜恭喜」，「大家發財」這一套吉祥詞句。明知　對方的處境實在很難有喜可賀，明知道自己更一輩子發不了財，然而口頭却依然是善頌善禱，不得不强顏歡笑，尤其是喝足　水幼時讀過聖賢書的，依照孔子　謂「文質彬彬然後君子」的道埋，這時候便只得注重「文」字，不然，人家好好向你恭喜，你却一味愁眉苦臉地反問喜從何來，雙方弄得窘相畢露，豈不也長　違人情之常麼？</p>
<p>大凡一個人能够我行我素，根據自己的興趣和意志做事，便　一種至高無上的快樂；反過來說，最痛苦的事便是有苦說不出，打腫了臉充胖子，明知其非，而又不得不非；明知其僞，而又不得不僞。敢笑敢駡，能哭能打的，就是痛快人；如果笑不得出聲，哭不能掉淚，仰人鼻息，看人眼色，就是天下最苦最苦的脚　。假若來年國泰民安，太平盛　，那未逢此一年一度的良辰，　家互相道賀祝福，自是由衷之　，說在嘴一　，甜在心裏，彼此　聽了吉祥話，當然能更增進心地的愉法；可惜的是這年頭兵荒馬亂，除夕夜債主冰冷的面孔，　隱約目前，而未來裁員减薪的惡　，又嫋嫋在耳，口口聲聲固　是吉利祥和，而心裏恰如倒翻了五味瓶，甜酸苦辣鹹，說不出的一種滋味。</p>
<p>人與人之間所以作僞到這樣地步看，或許吉祥話也是一個因　。例如有人死了父親，死就死，反正人總得死的，但是人們却　　死字，對死者的兒子不是說「仙逝」，便是說「歸天」，然　誰又知道他往昔背地裏儘在咒　老而不死是謂賊之類的話？作僞是一種壞道德，但是如果作僞　了習慣，便也變成一種人情，似乎是不作僞，便是不通人情，　依了習慣作僞，就是懂得禮節，稱得上一聲「上等人」。記得　時師長敎孩子們「知書識禮」，一方面把道德品格誠正樸實等叫孩子銘取遵照，一面又把一套應對體節大人們作　的習慣給他們學，可見得我國雖歷來注意道德提倡質樓，但如果習慣了作僞的禮節，就像說些，吉祥話之類，却是不但允許，並且是深堪嘉尙的。被英國文豪約翰孫詬爲「舞男」「娼妓」的蔡司非　士，便是專以敎子弟作僞和用吉祥話來騙飯吃的人，他的哲學是：旣然說吉祥話有飯吃，人便應該學說吉祥話。</p>
<p>世上多的是靠說吉祥話吃飯的人，從前結婚時候的喜娘，可以說是這類人最好的代表，滿口甘言蜜語，橫一個榮華富貴，豎一個子孫滿堂，雙方做事人家，便不得不加幾個喜封，賞一頓飯菜了。莫以爲幹這項營生容易，其實却也是辛苦得很，因爲第一須得把自己的情感慨之腦後，自己的意識打入冷宮；然後看見人在笑，你便也得來上　聲哈哈，還要笑得比人痛快；人在哭，你便也得掉下幾滴眼淚，並且更需比人哭得傷心，有了這一手本領，便能贏得主人的肉骨頭，無論何處不愁沒有穿着吃喝。這些在有些人看來，原是易事，可是假使給不善於監貌辨色的看來，却未始不是一件　事，因爲一不小心，伺君如伺虎，可能肉骨頭沒吃着，反而吃着鞭子哪！</p>
<p>離題愈說愈遠，並且話也不但不吉祥，似乎還有點嚕囌討厭，還是快快打住，說上一聲恭喜發財，庶免「烏鴉」之譏吧！</p>

<p>第十章自愿犧牲　（七三）</p>
<p>小王媽倒了一杯茶，遞給渚齋，渚齋又查問道：「今天考板出去時候，說什麼話沒有？」小王媽見渚齋着急的神情，很想把今天徐毓如來見綺紈，和　紈痛　　亂情形吿訴他，只怕這話一說出去，更增加渚齋難過，並且這裏面是爲什麼事，自己也弄不淸，便不敢冒昧說出，祗搖搖頭道：「老板臨去，並沒說什麼。」小王媽說後便在一個小凳上坐下，喊着”頭，心裏只是轉念，看這情形，詆怕要出什麼事，今夭老板出去的情形，比平日不同，看來這事是和那位徐老頭有關，但是老板旣然吩咐不許說，我那便吿訴徐先生呢。一面想着，一面看着渚齋，見他坐在沙發，一頭仰靠沙發背上，慘白的面孔，閉着眼睛，不時搖一搖頭，便問道：「徐先生，你說在馬路上，跌了一交，現在身上還痛嗎，別受了傷！」說着便站起來，走到渚齋跟前。渚齊兩眼睜開，一手撫住腰際，說道：「我覺得這裏酸痛。「小王媽笑道；「徐先生，你還記得嗎？上次你在胡同口，跌了一交，閃了腿，還是我给你按　好了，要不，你把衣服解開，給我看看，按摩按摩就好了。」渚齋道：「我懶得動，不要緊的。」小王媽見渚齋不願把衣服解開，又退坐椅上，兩眼僅看渚齋。渚　把眼睛閉上，因爲剛才小王媽說了一句上次在胡同口跌了一交，鈎起前事，想那時對綺紈，還在試標之間，並不似現在痛　相　的　切，並且那一次並沒受傷，完全是假的，今晚這一跌可不輕，但也顧不了許多，只要綺紈能平安同來，我就跌傷，也是甘心的。渚齋想了一回，又把眼睛睜開，見壁上鐘，日指坐在對面，一雙星眸仍凝注他臉上，蹙一蹙眉頭道：「老板還沒回來，眞急死人！」</p>

<p>美國原子筆大王雷諾到南京，掮着一枝本牌的原子筆，到處拍照，南京的新聞記者譏其「商人氣」太重，甚至說他發起空中探險，測量「世界第一高峯」，也只是一種「噱頭」，原來是替他的原子筆做廣吿的。</p>
<p>對於這樣的指責，站在一個中國人和現代人的立塲，我們祗有苦笑，簡直什麼話部說不出口。</p>
<p>旣然靑海的積石山可能是「世界第一高峯」，居於主人翁的我們爲何讓一個美國商人來賣這一句「噱頭」？我們的商人爲何見不及此，偏不　　自己出這風頭？「憂人發跡自怕窮」，除了自我陶醉的阿Q精神以外，怕是我們中國人最大的劣根性了。</p>
<p>我一點沒有「長他人志氣」的意思。我們這老大的古國在知識上的凍結，快到無可藥救的地步。除了賺錢以外，百分之九十九點九的中國人便不再有比較高尙的趣味。以一個成功的美國商人來發起探險，益顯得別的商人尙有求知的興趣，倒是我們自己「商人氣」太重，除了錢，便別無所求。</p>
<p>不管雷諾是爲了做廣吿，或是眞有志趣於探險，至少別人尙懂得「附庸風雅」。至於我們的商人，或是非商人而同樣發了財的呢，便不見得有那份斯文氣。有了黃金美鈔，甚至只多了數十億的法幣頭寸也只想跑會樂里，討小老婆了，誰還有一點比較高尙的興趣，如探險之類？昔人嘲村夫有云：鐘鳴漏盡，白髮　頭者，若多收幾斛麥，便後置側室。可見中國人討小老婆的興趣之高，是古已有之，於今爲烈的。</p>
<p>舊有的民族活力是失去了，如今口成了强權政治的國際棋局中的一各小卒，所能誇口的只是「數千年的歷史」，而這歷史的寳庫還得別人來開發，因爲自己不曾知道有這寳庫，甚至知道了也沒有這份開發的資力和興趣。今日的埃及，伊朗，和印度都類乎此，國而僅僅標榜一個「古」字，並不是有面子的事。</p>

<p>— 紀穆</p>
<p>我他替　個朋友，上銀行去領取戰前存款，我站在鐵柵欄的外邊，手中拿了一疊存單，好容易等這銀行員將私事料理完畢，挨到我將存單交進去，一面若有所失的等看他的的搭搭的將存款折合的數字算出來。我靦着臉問他有多少錢，他吿訴我這一筆在五六年前分別存入的總額一千三百元，現在祗値六十八萬數千元。同時，他將一塊銅牌交給我。</p>
<p>我轉身到這家銀行的「付款」的窗口去取錢，雖然這並不是我自己的錢，但是在衆目睽睽之下，我仿彿成了世界上最愚蠢的人。在他們心目中，我似乎是一個不知道購買貨物，保全幣値的惟一的傻瓜，坐視法幣的價値，像蛋糕上的一塊奶汕，一剎眼就融化了。</p>
<p>片刻，付款員在接通付出二千萬元，三千萬元，五百萬元等數目後，喊到我拿到的那塊銅牌的號碼，承他很「慷慨」的給了六十九萬元整數給我。我仿彿替我的朋友結束了數年以來迄未解決的一件懸案，鬆下一口氣來，但是同時胸口依稀壓了一塊沉重的石頭，爲我的朋友難受。</p>
<p>的確，在這奔跑式的通貨膨脹之下，不少人民的辛動積蓄，都給挪在路後了。依照經濟學上最基本的詮釋，貨幣應該具有（一）交易的媒介，（二）價値的公量，（三）價値的儲藏，（四）遞延支付的標準……等功用，目前它似乎祇可充前二者用途，至於後二者的功用，早付闕如了。我們自然不希望使用一種功能殘缺不全的貨幣。目前，主張幣制改革的呼聲甚高，其原因的一端，也許在此。</p>
<h3 id="c167">足畫 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>淸代高其佩以手指作畫，號指頭生活，於是指畫之名便盛行於畫壇，近代擅指畫者，頗不乏人，用足指作畫者則尙無所聞。徵之畫史，則能以足指作畫者竟有三人。</p>
<p>（一）魯班：百家書云：公輸班之水，見　曰：見汝形。蠡乃出頭，班以足畫圖之。見風俗通義。又水經注云：舊有付留神像。此神嘗與魯班語，班令其人出，付留曰：我貌獰醜，卿善圖物容，我不能出。班於是拱手與言曰：出頭見我。忖留乃出首。班於是以脚晝地，忖留覺之，便還沒水，故置像於水，唯背以上立水上。</p>
<p>（二）巧者：秦始皇求與海神相見，神云：我形醜，約莫圖我形，當與帝會。始皇入海三十里，與神相見。左右有巧者，潛以脚畫神形。—三齊略記。</p>
<p>（三）張衡：建州浦城縣山有獸名駭神，豕身人首，好出水邊石上，平子（張衡）往寫之，獸入潭中不出。或曰：此獸畏人畫，故不出也，可去紙筆。歟果出，平子拱手不動。潛以足指畫獸。—郭氏異物志。</p>
<p>公輸班和魯班，普通均認爲係一人。春秋時代魯國巧匠，墨子作公輸盤，孟子離　註，作公轍子魯班，史記集解，後漢書注，文選注均引作公輸般。惟朝野僉載云：「魯般者肅州敦煌人，莫詳年代。巧俾造化，嘗作木鳶，乘之而飛。六國公轍般，亦爲太鳶以窺宋城」。則又似爲二人。其實朝野僉載之言，頗不可信，仍應以墨子孟子之言爲一人較爲可靠。</p>
<p>觀上述故事四則，人名，神名，地名，時代，雖各有不同，但其內容則殊無一致，用足指畫水上之神，而神醜畏畫。大概古代有此傳說，時代旣久，不免傳聞異詞，初見，似爲三事，其實乃一種故事之演變。究竟三人之中，何人能以足指作畫？現在當然已不可考，但由於此種故事之流傳，足徵足畫之可能。戰前上海　有「萬能脚」者，其人生而無手，兩脚能作種種技藝，常公開表演，今已不知何往，惜未見其能作　耳。北平黃二南能以舌作畫，更爲畫壇中之怪矣。</p>

<p>今日世界各地的人民，無不受到高物價的重壓，窒息得連氣都透不過來。但在加勒比海北部的一個小島上，化一元美金能够在物質上供應上，舒適上獲得五倍的享受，使無數美國人趨之若狂。這是美國南面第三個小島，即世人所熟知的海地共和國（Haiti）。海地島上充滿浪漫的氣息，色彩鮮明，風景宜人。</p>
<p>米亞米坐海上飛機到海地，四小時可以抵達該國首都太子港（Port－au－Prince）。世界上任何一處的景色不能與此地相比。自長着靑葱林木的山麓起，一直伸展到海灘邊的便是這富有生氣的白色都市，在陽光下閃着光輝。碼頭小工正在搬運東西，赤脚，露出一身筋肉，呼噪着，很喧鬧的樣子。一些淡色容貌的混血兒，是海地的豪門貴族，穿打的是美國最近流行的服飾，坐了華貴汽車一瞬而過。道路平廣，建築新穎，偶見汚穢的街車，破舊的茅舍——這些便是令人難忘的海地共和國首都形勝。</p>
<p>在這裏，化了五百美元一年，便可以使你生活得非常舒服。</p>
<p>到處有俱樂部，高爾夫與網球塲，華麗的沙龍與餐室，還有兩家電影院，一所跑馬塲。旅館，俱樂部，餐室中的烹飪全是法國式的。在市內緩緩上昇的斜坡上，一直到山頂，全是海地豪門的公館。</p>
<p>豪門的公館美麗之極，配置着亭　樓閣，濃蔭草地，還有各種奇花異草，一年四季，可以天天有鮮花供養。這種極盡現代化的房屋，租金每月大概自四十元至一百五十元。至於低物價的原因是由於海地島上原始的經濟機構—豪富的貴族的貧困的佃農。</p>
<p>海地的知名之士膚色大都不黑，受過高等敎育，文化程度極高。據一部標準著作，詹姆士。雷朋所著的「海地人民」上講：當地的大家巨室，追溯其宗族，都是系出於法國貴胄云。巨室大家在各階層都有，尤其以政府官吏，軍事領袖，或是主要工業的主持人爲多。他們在法國讀書，智力上和世界任何上層份子相等。雷朋的著作中還說起，貴族與佃農之間從未發生過爭執。</p>
<p>普通海地人都屬農夫，有一小片土地，用汗血來換取穀類，豆類，棉花，咖啡，烟草的收成。他們目不識丁，更談不到寫字了。</p>
<p>一個農夫的全年收入幾乎只等於美金一元五角。有住在海地多年的人說：某一村民不愼於火，全家盡遭回祿。可是只費了一元二角半之數便已規復舊觀。建築村料取之於河畔的爛泥與茅草。費了六天人工，每天一角五分，共計九角，其餘的三角五分則是用在購置傢具等件。</p>
<p>到海地去旅行的人可在半山租一所別墅，有游泳池與網球塲等設備，其所費祗及美國國內一個平常的公寓房間。他們在別墅中如其僱用廚司，使女，男僕，洗衣婦，花匠，司機等等，工鈿總數，每月不過五十元。</p>
<p>最好的牛肉二角一磅；雞三角一隻；世界上最好的咖啡，每磅一角二分，糖六角一磅。就是一屋期七天排日盛宴，其所費也每月不會超過七十五元。</p>
<p>美國人所憂慮者倒是游客絡繹而來，都想找房子，不免使物價要轟上去。一百年來海地可說絕無變化，只要該國能善維現狀，眞可以作爲遯世者的樂土了。</p>

<p>提起故鄕，例可稱「吾」。用到「吾」字，不論甚麼事情，又照例有些謙遜，同時又有些誇傲　話頭兒。這也可以說是國人尤其文人的一種習氣，只要「謙」得有根，「誇」得有據，却亦無妨談談。</p>

He also said: The situation in the Northeast is not as serious as rumored, but if it is to be developed, new forces must be added. The method requires everyone to think of it and only by working steadily can it be successful. The inclination of Northeastern compatriots towards the central government is very sincere now, so we should seize the opportunity and urgently seek to save it. Ma Zhanshan also said: Saving the Northeast should not be delayed. The government should no longer hesitate and come up with clear and decisive measures. After all, many Northeastern compatriots still do not understand what the government's policy for governing the Northeast is.</p>

Suppressing bandits is the unanimous demand of all people who want to live, want a country, want a family, and want freedom. Mao Ze once said: "In the process of revolution, 150 million people must be sacrificed!" Do we want doctrine or the people? What is the meaning of sacrificing the people for doctrine? He emphasized that the suppression of bandits must be fast to reduce suffering. Now the villagers feel their lives are threatened, and the city people feel their livelihoods are threatened. Suppressing bandits cannot be completed by military means alone. It must be achieved through the coordination of political, economic, cultural, and other related factors.</p>

At 5:00 pm, he went to the City Government to meet with Mayor Wu and exchanged views on the current situation of prices and the methods of handling them in Shanghai and Guangzhou. When Mr. Ouyang left the City Government, he detailed the food prices, dance ban situation, and smuggling phenomena in Guangzhou at the request of reporters, stating: The Guangzhou food rationing plan was drafted before February and is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is believed that once implemented, rice prices can be suppressed and stabilized. The Guangdong Provincial Government and the Guangzhou Municipal Government jointly established a food adjustment agency to cooperate in the distribution of U.S. relief materials to achieve practical results. Although rice prices in Guangzhou are also gradually rising, they are not as high as in Shanghai, because the area is a distribution center for rice, and there are fewer people hoarding and speculating. In terms of daily necessities, Guangzhou also adopts a negotiated price system, which can control general prices. In terms of the dance ban, there are fewer dancers in Guangzhou, with a total of only 300 people. The municipal government has now approved the exemption of their special tax for three months, which will be used for vocational women's dancer conversion training, fortunately without causing trouble. Regarding the smuggling trend, it has gradually subsided. The municipal government has captured 400 to 500 smugglers, all of whom are threatened by unemployment. After the municipal government helped them individually switch careers, the smuggling situation has been greatly reduced. Furthermore, Mayor Ouyang took the overnight express to Beijing last night.</p>

Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, the two subsidies amount to over 110 billion yuan. However, for the aforementioned two subsidies, each province must still draft a budget and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for onward submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Central Government has historically provided minimal subsidies for the operating expenses of each province, and in the future, each province will still need to raise funds independently, and the Central Government will not provide subsidies. The financial situation of Shanghai Municipality is better than that of other provinces and municipalities nationwide. In principle, the Ministry of Finance hopes that Shanghai Municipality can achieve self-sufficiency after reorganizing its tax revenue and no longer requires central government subsidies. Furthermore, the points decided at the local finance review meeting on the 16th and the opinions raised by the finance directors of each province are currently being compiled by the Local Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance. The finance directors of each province who attended the meeting can also draft written opinions regarding local finance and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for compilation. After a comprehensive plan is formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it can be implemented.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The finance directors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Jehol, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces have arrived in the capital one after another to request subsidies from the Central Government, and a result has been reached. A solution has also been agreed upon regarding the issue of raising funds for local defense expenses, and they will return to their posts within one or two days.</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Emergence of the North Korean Puppet Government! <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The endlessly disputed Korean issue has now entered a new and serious stage. According to the Pyongyang Radio Station in Soviet-controlled North Korea, the "Democratic People's Republic" has been established in the Soviet-occupied zone of North Korea, and the "North Korean People's Army" has been established. The organization of this government adopts the Soviet system. Kim Il-sung is the Chairman of the People's Committee. The constitution stipulates that the national flag is white with a red horizontal stripe, and the national emblem is a white background with a red star, surrounded by two crossed hammers and sickles each, rice stalks, steelworkers, and a mountain. The United Nations and the United States are paying close attention to this situation. The members of the United Nations Commission on Korea, who are working in South Korea, have successively withdrawn to Lake Success to attend the UN Small Assembly on the 19th to prepare a report on the overall Korean issue. These facts symbolize the failure of the United Nations Commission on Korea, the Soviet Union's deliberate split of Korea, and the unconscious and disunited crisis of North and South Korea. From now on, it will bring new and serious disasters to the Far East and the future world!</p>
<p>Korea, also known as the Korean Peninsula, is one of the most disputed and troubled areas after the war. Frankly speaking, the creation of these disputes and troubles was a serious mistake made by the secret diplomacy of the Cairo, Potsdam, and Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conferences, which arranged a tragedy for Korea early on! Although the Cairo Conference in October 1943 provided a guarantee for the independence and freedom of Korea, it regrettably stated that "Korea will be made free and independent in due course." Because independence still requires a "due course," this guarantee was half-failed. The Potsdam Conference's decision to divide Korea at the 38th parallel, with American and Soviet troops occupying the north and south respectively, was especially ridiculously wrong. At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union further requested territorial concessions for certain islands in Korea in order to restore the rights seized during the Tsarist era. President Roosevelt, due to illness, accepted this in a state of confusion. The Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in December of the same year decided that the United States and the Soviet Union would divide Korea north and south, and a mixed commission would be formed by representatives of the military command headquarters to assist in the establishment of a Korean provisional government, and then establish a unified democratic autonomous government. However, before Korea is fully independent, it must undergo five years of trusteeship. The Korean people opposed trusteeship and opposed the division of the north and south by American and Soviet troops. However, based on the errors of the international conference, the powerful countries ignored Korean opposition and insisted on continuing the error, wearing armor and carrying spears, and forcibly entered Korea, reluctantly building a barrier at the 38th parallel, and splitting the good, whole Korea into two regions!</p>
<p>From the establishment of the US-Soviet Mixed Commission in Seoul in March 1946 until the adoption of the seven resolutions by the UN General Assembly on November 14 last year, there was little harmony and a lack of cooperation. The UN plan stipulated the organization of a Korean Commission, with representatives from nine countries to work in Korea, supervise the general election in Korea, and assist in government organization. On January 8 this year, representatives from various countries gathered in Seoul and elected Indian representative Menon as chairman, deciding to set March 31 as the general election date. The Commission encountered numerous difficulties in its one month of work in Korea: on the one hand, the Soviet Union's uncooperative attitude, Ukraine's non-participation in the Commission, and North Korea's refusal to allow the Commission to go north of the 38th parallel made the Commission members feel both ridiculous and helpless. On the other hand, the divisions among South Korean political parties, the stubbornness of Syngman Rhee, Kim Gu, and others, and the strikes and sabotage by the South Korean communists made the Commission's work even more difficult. The Commission could not break through the political divide between North and South Korea, could not obtain Soviet cooperation, and the various parties and factions in Korea were concerned about ideological orientations, and were unaware of self-awareness and self-improvement, and could not be persuaded by the neutral members of the Commission. Under these circumstances, the Commission's work was at a standstill. Menon left with a feeling of disappointment, preparing to draft a report on this chaotic situation for discussion by the Small Assembly.</p>
<p>The Small Assembly's countermeasures to the Korean issue will be worthy of attention. Looking at the trend, the Small Assembly may accept the Commission's proposal to temporarily complete the election in South Korea and organize a provisional government, pending cooperation from North Korea. In order to counter the future decisions of the Small Assembly and seize the initiative, the Soviet Union suddenly announced the establishment of the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" when the United Nations Commission was leaving Korea. From then on, the puppet came on stage, the barriers were fortified, and the tragedy of the Korean nation began. We attach importance to this situation, are concerned about the development of the Korean division, and have to point out the serious impact of this issue on the Far East today when Pyongyang Radio announced the emergence of the North Korean Republic:</p>
<p>(1) The emergence of the North Korean Republic not only violates the decisions of the Cairo, Potsdam, and Yalta conferences, but also violates the Moscow Agreement and the repeated decisions of the United Nations. The Soviet Union's unilateral action is a threat to the United States and the United Nations, and even has a latent effect on China and Japan. The Communist army in Northeast China is connected to North Korea. In the future, the Communist coup in China will follow in the footsteps of North Korea, and a new puppet Manchuria can appear in Northeast China at any time. If this red puppet Manchuria, unfortunately, forms a red fortress in the Far East with Outer Mongolia and North Korea, it will bring a serious threat to the Far East, a new crisis to the world, and an unimaginable future to human catastrophe, which will be no different from the puppet Manchuria created by Japan after the September 18th Incident, and even surpass it.</p>
<p>(2) The emergence of the North Korean Republic illustrates the Soviet Union's attempt to sweep through the entire Korean peninsula. The North Korean government currently has more than 200,000 troops, while South Korea claims to be democratic but is unarmed; North Korea has a large amount of arms stockpiles, while South Korea has no self-defense reserves. American observers predict that after the emergence of the North Korean government, the Soviet army will superficially withdraw from Korea, and North Korea's provocative actions against South Korea will cross the 38th parallel, and even attack key points in South Korea, to complete the "unification" of the entire Korea in their minds. Soviet propagandists tell the world that the Soviet army's withdrawal is not responsible for the Korean civil war, the same as the Soviet army's withdrawal from Changchun and Shenyang at that time. In fact, the Korean civil war is a plan prearranged by the Soviet Union to sweep through the entire Korean peninsula. Now shadows are looming over North and South Korea, and the prelude to the civil war has already begun with the emergence of the North Korean Republic.</p>
<p>(3) The emergence of the North Korean Republic and the Soviet army's preparation for withdrawal will have a new impact on the US attitude. If the United States can no longer tolerate the development of this situation, withdraws from South Korea, and retreats to protect Japan, it will inevitably accept North Korea's provocations and evolve the Korean civil war into an international war. Whether the United States' current hesitation on its attitude towards the Far East will be forced to embark on this path is difficult for us to predict at this time. However, it is expected that the US policy toward the Far East will have to make new decisions and changes because of this.</p>
<p>In short, the emergence of the North Korean Republic brings a painful and pitiable tragedy to Korea. We feel infinite sorrow for the future of Korean independence and the future situation in the Far East. The current crisis conceals a dark scene of turmoil and the shadow of the god of war. If the United States is still indecisive, if the United Nations is still weak and powerless, the future of the Far East will be more misfortune than fortune!</p>

<p>[Continued from Page One] The envoy stated, "Although the situation is serious, we are paying attention to it every day to avoid a sudden crisis that we cannot handle, but it is not so serious that we need to consider evacuating nationals. The embassy is only advising American nationals in the war zone to evacuate, not in a mandatory manner." Although British Ambassador to China Steve Stevenson notified unnecessary British nationals in North China, especially women and children, to evacuate to Shanghai yesterday, the US State Department has not issued such a notice. The envoy also firmly denied that American nationals in Qingdao have been ordered to evacuate, as well as those in Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. If the aforementioned locations are under serious and dangerous attack by the Communist army, then American nationals will naturally evacuate. The envoy also acknowledged that the State Department and the US military authorities in China have a complete evacuation plan, "This plan is revised at any time according to changes in the situation, but it is a routine matter. The embassy and the army and navy each have their own plans and often refer to each other for coordination. Although the content cannot be disclosed, it is ensured that all American nationals will be protected in any emergency. The United States has many aircraft and ships in China and other parts of the Far East, which are sufficient for transportation, which is something the UK cannot match. In view of this, the British side has to plan ahead. The US side, on the other hand, is currently taking a defensive stance and does not need to take further action. As for whether the staff and their families at the consulate in Shenyang need to evacuate, there is no specific decision. In short, everything depends on the environment." The US military authorities are well aware that the Communist army has not changed its strategy of avoiding strong points and attacking weak points.</p>

<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 17th] Rice and grain prices in Wuxi are rising sharply. The county government implemented emergency measures, dispatched a large number of personnel to the market to suppress prices, and the market situation has stabilized slightly. Top-quality white rice is traded at 1.9 million to 1.92 million, top-quality white indica rice at 1.88 million, top-quality white yuan rice at 1.93 million, Heshang rice at 830,000, __ rice at 815,000, Indica rice at 795,000, Yuan rice at 835,000, wheat at 2.22 million, white wheat at 2.27 million, naval vessel flour at 888,000, soybean oil at 4.48 million, and double-rain yarn at 46.2 million, all breaking new highs. County Magistrate Xu, Chairman of the County Grain Management Committee, convened a meeting of leaders of relevant industries at 2 p.m. this afternoon to stabilize grain prices and decided on five measures for grain price control: (1) The selling price of top-quality white rice is adjusted to 1.75 million, and retail price is 1.83 million. (2) Grain merchants and rice mills should absolutely be responsible for supplying retail sales. If there is a shortage of goods, causing disorder, they should be fully responsible. (3) Speculators will be investigated and prosecuted by the Land and Grain Department. (4) The price of wheat should not be too far from that of rice. Those who have hoarded for more than a month should be ordered to sell. (5) There is still a lot of soybean inventory in this city, but the price is rising, which is unreasonable. The county government will check the warehouse receipts and quantities of the warehouse and oil factories, and then study ways to stabilize prices.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Zhang Jia'ao Discusses Developing Taiwan's Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Taiwan, Pledging to Raise 9 Million US Dollars to Improve Railways and Electricity <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 17th] Zhang Jia'ao talked to reporters at one o'clock in the afternoon on the seventeenth: The railways in the province urgently need to replenish equipment. Vehicles, sleepers, strengthen transportation. Electricity also needs to be supplemented. The central government allocated 80,000 tons of fertilizer, which is still insufficient, and it is hoped that new plants will be added. He has little hope of exchanging foreign currency for local specialties in the province. The adjustment of the combined currency at any time is recognized as the expression of central support. He also said: State-provincial and private enterprises should cooperate and link up, and foreign investment must be carried out under our economic construction plan. He especially emphasized that the central government must not fail to support those that are beneficial, and he hoped that those who come to Taiwan from the mainland will work hard to study, because the Japanese spent years building Taiwan, and we should not deal with things casually. He has indeed promised to raise 9 million US dollars to improve railways and electricity, and has promised to support private enterprises and supply public companies with legal currency head offices.</p>
<p>Zhang believes that in order to engage in the construction of Taiwan, psychological design must be listed first, and economic construction must be listed second. If you want to seek economic construction, you must base it on psychological 魏. Taiwan's industrial and mining industries are not rich in congenital conditions, and all depend on human efforts to promote them, which is much inferior to the northeast. He believes that railway transportation and electricity are the most urgent business items that should be paid special attention to at present. The current daily railway transportation capacity in Taiwan Province is only 12,000 tons. The main goods transported are sugar, coal, and rice. Taking sugar alone, only 12,000 tons of sugar are transported per month. However, Taiwan Sugar Company produced 300,000 tons of sugar this year, which is difficult to transport and export in its entirety. Therefore, more warehouses must be built, and it may even affect the plan to produce 500,000 tons of sugar next year. Zhang also said: Fertilizer and sugar production are closely related to the lives of farmers in Taiwan, and the importance of these two industries is second only to railways and electricity. Zhang believes that the enterprises that should be paid attention to are industries that can exchange foreign currency, such as cement, tea, and brains, and industries that can save foreign exchange expenditures, such as petroleum, papermaking, and alkali production. When talking about the coal industry, Zhang believed that the coal produced in Taiwan, due to the result of shipping it all to Shanghai in the past, has reduced the production volume of some industries in Taiwan due to the lack of coking coal. For example, the switch factory and the cement factory are all feeling the shortage of coal. Zhang said: "I have paid the greatest attention to allocating funds to assist the development of Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises, but all specific plans need to be carefully considered after returning to Shanghai."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] The Xinying Pulp Mill, jointly operated by the Resource Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government, is the largest in our country. It started operations on the sixteenth. The factory uses sugar cane bagasse from the sugar factory to manufacture pulp. The maximum output can reach 80 tons per day. Currently, it can produce 70 tons per day, but due to limited raw materials, it only produces 40 tons per day. According to Gao Yongxiang, the director of the factory, in addition to meeting the needs of public and private paper mills in Taiwan, half of the pulp produced by the factory can still be sold to Shanghai. Cai Yingchang Yan Jiakan said: This paper mill has six new-style cooking pots, and if used for cooking, it can feed 2 million of the 6 million Taiwanese people.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] The first batch of 1,500 tons of cement from Taiwan sold abroad was shipped from Kaohsiung to Manila by the Chinese merchant "Taiping Wheel" on the 17th. According to Xu Zongchen, general manager of Taiwan Cement Company, the company's current monthly output is 20,000 tons, and it will increase to 40,000 tons after September this year. All products will be given priority for use in Taiwan Province. When there is surplus, priority will be given to sales in Southeast Asia, and sales in Fujian and Guangdong provinces will be second. Today, the government's need for foreign exchange is the most urgent. The 1,500 tons sold to the Philippines this time are priced at 20 US dollars per ton, delivered in Kaohsiung, and are for trial sales. When the output increases in the future, it can be sold to Southeast Asia in large quantities.</p>

<h3 id="e61">US Attitude Remains Firm on the Soviet Union's Unilateral Actions in North Korea, Insisting on a Comprehensive Solution by the United Nations <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] According to authoritative sources, the United States will continue to insist on a United Nations solution to the entire Korean problem, regardless of the Soviet Union's unilateral action in establishing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States believes that the Soviet Union's action is clearly a propaganda ploy and was expected. US officials said that although the Soviet Union has established a government in North Korea, it would be unwise for the United States to establish an independent state in South Korea as well. The Soviet Union's action is clearly intended to confuse the United States and the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea. The United States hopes that the United Nations Little Assembly, considering the further suggestive application made by the commission to Korea, will decide that elections should be held in South Korea to establish a legislative body, and that the United Nations or the United States should retain the high authority to send military forces to guarantee the integrity of South Korea.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 17th] The New York Times reporter in Seoul reported that US authorities' reaction to the announcement of the establishment of the People's Republic of North Korea was very straightforward and indignant. One senior US authority spokesman said, "We are acting entirely in accordance with international agreements, and we have never violated any international agreements in letter or spirit. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union ignored the Moscow agreement and the authority of the United Nations, and engaged in acts of betraying the agreement secretly and then publicly, establishing a huge army in the north, which is a clear breach of contract, and it is by no means possible to complete it in a few months. The United States has repeatedly attempted to establish a solution to the Korean problem, first seeking cooperation with the Soviet Union to no avail, and then seeking a solution with the support and cooperation of the United Nations, but each effort has been thwarted. US authorities believe that the Soviet Union intends to get ahead of the United Nations in establishing an accomplished fact, and the Soviet Union has decided to go its own way regardless of the outcome of the Little Assembly's discussion of the United Nations.</p>
<p>[United Press to Washington, 16th] Whether the Soviet Union's announcement of its determination to withdraw the Red Army from Korea is credible is still being debated. If all sides believe that, because the North Korean radio station strongly advocated the summoning of all Korean troops to defend Korea, the Soviet Union may announce the withdrawal of Korean troops stationed in Korea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Sims, the international news editor of the Scripps-Howard system in the United States, said today that destiny seems to have been doomed, and Korea has become the Poland of the Far East. He pointed out the seriousness of the situation in Northeast China and warned that Japan is also in danger of turning red, and as a result, the entire Asia will also turn red. This kind of disaster is even worse than the threat of Japan before. If the UN Commission decides to hold elections in the US-occupied area of Korea, it will not achieve anything. He speculated that since the Sovietized regime has been established in North Korea, there is a highly organized Korean Communist Party, and there is a large army of 200,000 to support it. Once the US and Soviet troops withdraw, the Korean government under Soviet rule will be established.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] The Chairman of the United Nations Korean Commission, Indian representative Menon, arrived at LaGuardia Airport in New York by plane on the sixteenth. He said in a speech that he would report to the United Nations Little Assembly on the 19th on the difficulties in implementing the United Nations General Assembly resolution to establish an independent Korea. Those who arrived at the same time as Menon included Dr. Hu Shize, Secretary-General of the Commission and Chinese Representative, and Jacobs, political adviser to General Hodge, Commander of the US Army in Korea. Menon, who stayed in Korea for five weeks, said: "He was very surprised to hear about the establishment of the Soviet puppet government in North Korea and pointed out that the Korean people are very eager to maintain unity because they have been unified for many centuries."</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 17th] The Philippine representative to the United Nations Korean Commission, Lunz, said today that the United Nations should take decisive measures against the establishment of a "puppet communist government" in the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's purpose is to establish a communist government for the entire Korea. If the United Nations fails to take decisive measures, it will be impossible to establish a democratic Korean government. Lunz pointed out that the Soviet Union is trying to provoke an internal chaos in Korea, so that the Communist Party can control the entire country through the Korean army organized by the Soviet Union in North Korea. He said that the Soviet Union has "established a so-called democratic government headed by Kim Il-sung in North Korea. Kim is a member of the Communist Party and returned from the Soviet Union in 1945." According to his estimates, the number of North Korean troops is approximately 400,000.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 17th] The announcement of the establishment of the "People's Republic" in North Korea has caused great concern among the people here, because North Korea's move was so secret and rapid that it was beyond ordinary expectations. Therefore, they all expressed regret for the slow actions of the United Nations Korean Commission. Also: People here pay close attention to the enthusiastic participation of the people of North Korea in the discussion of the newly promulgated draft constitution of North Korea, and the propaganda activities in the streets of Pinghuai to support the new republic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 17th] A commentator on North Korean radio yesterday criticized General Hodge, the commander-in-chief of the US military in South Korea, for being willing to become a war profiteer. He said: "Hodge is ordered by US imperialists to implement a colonial policy in South Korea, trying to make South Korea a military base for aggression in Asia." The commentator also said that North Korea's refusal to allow the United Nations Commission to go there was because it understood that the purpose of the Commission was only to make Korea a colony of the United States.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th, United Press] US Army officials said that the Soviet Union's accusation that the Western powers delayed the opening of the second battlefield in Europe in order to exhaust the Soviet Union was a lie. The reason why the Allies did not cross the strait to attack the European continent until June 7, 1944 was due to the lack of sufficient troops and landing craft. The Soviet Union made this accusation against the Western Allies in its recent statement. The Soviet statement stated that the Western Allies promised to open the second war in 1942 or 1943, but delayed in fulfilling their promise, so that the Soviet Union could not become a major power after the war due to the damage it suffered.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the Soviet Union's establishment of the Democratic People's Republic in the North Korean occupied zone, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a report from our Consul General in Seoul, Liu Yuwan, based on the Soviet broadcast in Pinghuai. Min Shilin, a spokesman for the Korean Provisional Government's representative office in China, said that North Korea's move came much later than they had expected, and that the government of the Republic was transformed from the former "People's Committee". Mr. Min said: The Korean people all hope that a unified government will appear, but the hope can never be realized under the occupation of two extreme forces with different intentions. The Soviet Union has caused terrible famine in North Korea, while the United States has reused pro-Japanese right-wing elements in South Korea. They believe that the Korean people have the right to handle their own problems and do not want any external forces to continue to meddle in and mess things up. Our Foreign Ministry did not criticize this view, but may reiterate our advocacy for the unification and independence of Korea at the press conference on the 18th.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] White House Secretary Ross announced that the President, in view of the seriousness of the situation in Palestine, has personally called for peace to the countries in the Middle East. For several weeks, the outside world has been spreading the word that Arab leaders opposed the United Nations plan to split Palestine, threatening to launch a "holy war." Truman's call was directed at them. The original text of the White House notice is as follows: "In order to try to prevent the spread of chaos in the Middle East, the US government has issued appeals to the governments concerned in recent months, emphasizing the importance of tolerance in dealing with the situation in Palestine for the sake of interests in the Middle East and world peace and security." Ross refused to disclose the targets of the appeal and said that its nature was purely "confidential" and there was no hope of publishing it in the near future.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] White House sources said today: President Truman's call was sent to the leaders of the seven countries of the Arab League.

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations Palestine Committee submitted a report to the Security Council tonight, advocating that the Security Council organize an international army to implement the partition of Palestine. The report, 19 pages long, was unanimously adopted by the committee. Its main points are as follows: (1) The Palestine Committee cannot maintain law and order without adequate military force. (2) Strong Arab forces inside and outside Palestine are trying to change the resolution of the General Assembly by force. (3) Some irresponsible elements of the Jewish race continue to engage in violent actions, which make the situation worse. (4) Britain's refusal to allow the establishment of Jewish militias before the end of the committee's rule will delay the implementation of the partition. (5) Unless another non-Palestinian army replaces the British army, Jerusalem will not be able to defend itself. (6) If the United Nations does not provide troops, the Palestine Committee will not be able to carry out its mission. (7) After the end of the committee's rule, if there are no organized militias in both the Jewish and Arab countries, an extremely serious situation will occur.

The postponement was suggested by the United States. It is said that the postponement is unrelated to the Soviet Union's criticism of the conference.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry in Paris stated that the U.S. State Department wishes its ambassador to the UK, Douglas, to remain in Washington this week during the U.S. Congressional review of the European Recovery Program. A British Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the American proposal had been received before the end of last week, as Ambassador Douglas would be unable to arrive here before the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th Day] Speculation is rife here regarding the reason for the postponement of the Anglo-American-French conference on the German problem. It is generally believed that this is due to the attitude of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as these three countries have requested full participation in the conference and wish to resolve this issue before the conference opens. The explanation that the postponement is due to the inability of the U.S. Ambassador to the UK, Douglas, to attend is hardly credible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 17th Day] The Foreign Ministers of Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia officially began a two-day meeting on the 17th to discuss relations with Germany. The Czech Foreign Minister, Masaryk, as host, gave an opening speech stating that the meeting could freely discuss other issues.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Antarctic Land Dispute; Relations Between Britain, Argentina, and Chile Deteriorate <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th Day] Undersecretary McNeil stated in the House of Commons that Britain will not ignore provocations by other parties regarding British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The British government has taken steps to ensure that the Governor of the Falkland Islands receives any necessary assistance. Although the dispute over Antarctic land claims has long existed, no one has ever used this matter to incite international resentment. Britain is confident that the governments of Argentina and Chile can agree to refrain from provocative actions on this matter. The Argentine and Chilean navies are now demonstrating in British territorial waters around the Falkland Islands, and have declared that they will demand sovereignty over the area and have dispatched troops to land, intending to establish a headquarters in British territory. The British government believes that British sovereignty is beyond dispute and is willing to submit the matter to the International Court of Justice, which has been rejected by Argentina and Chile. Argentina has also suggested convening an international conference, which Britain is considering.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Johannesburg, 16th Day] The 8,000-ton British cruiser "Nigeria," which left Simon's Town yesterday under secret orders, is heading to the British Falkland Islands in Antarctica. Chilean President Videla has departed for Greenwich Island in the Falkland Islands to preside over the establishment ceremony of a Chilean army base. Unconfirmed reports state that Argentine President Perón will also travel to Antarctica to meet with the Chilean President. It is understood that the Falkland Islands consist of over two hundred islands. Argentina has already established a weather station on Deception Island, while Britain maintains that all Falkland Islands belong to British sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th Day] The "News Chronicle" reported today that Argentina and Chile's pursuit of sovereignty over the British Falkland Islands, which produce minerals, is the motivation behind their actions.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th Day] The House of Representatives will elect a new Prime Minister within the week. Due to the competition among the major political parties and their unwillingness to concede, the possibility of a coalition cabinet is considered most likely. There are currently two possible developments: (1) Liberal Party leader Shigeru Yoshida or Democratic Party leader Hitoshi Ashida will become Prime Minister, forming a coalition cabinet with the Liberal, Democratic, People's Cooperative, and several smaller parties; (2) Hitoshi Ashida will lead the organization of a coalition cabinet of the Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party, with the Liberal Party becoming the opposition party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Day, United Press Dispatch] The selection of the Japanese Prime Minister will accelerate after the Allied Council for Japan convenes tomorrow. The meeting of the Council will be closely watched by the leaders of the political parties, who are currently in a stalemate.</p>

<p>Striving for Victory and the Premise Determines Everything</p>
<p>On June 22, 1941, when the news of Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union reached me, I was ill at home. I immediately called the President and then Undersecretary of State Welles. I said the same thing to both of them:</p>
<p>"We must give the Soviet Union all possible assistance, by every means possible. We have repeatedly said that we will do our utmost to give all assistance to any country that resists the Axis. The Soviet Union falls into this category, without any hesitation."</p>
<p>I knew that some military experts, both here and abroad, expected Hitler to destroy the Soviet Union in a matter of weeks in the war. But I could not believe this, just as I could not believe the many claims that after the fall of France, Britain's collapse would be a matter of weeks. When we shipped large quantities of weapons to Britain in the summer of 1940, I did not feel that we were taking a real risk of those weapons falling into German hands. I also believed that we could send all the weapons and supplies we could possibly get to the Soviet Union without the real danger of them being seized by the Germans. If the President and I doubted the Soviet Union's ability to resist Germany, then it would have been too foolish to send weapons to the Soviet Union while clearly believing that the weapons would fall into Hitler's hands.</p>
<p>For six months we had good reason to believe that Hitler would attack the Soviet Union, so the events of June 22 did not surprise us.</p>
<p>In January 1941, our Commercial Attaché in Berlin, Huth, received a secret report. Huth had a German friend who, although an enemy of the Nazis, had close ties with various German ministries, the Deutsche Bank, and high-ranking Nazi Party members. As early as August 1940, this friend notified Huth that Hitler's High Command was holding meetings to prepare for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union. This news became more concrete a few weeks later, when Hitler reportedly said that he wanted "only my soldiers from Vladivostok to Gibraltar."</p>
<p>Huth often met this friend in a Berlin cinema. This friend reserved seats through an agency, sent two tickets to Huth, tried to sit next to him, and slipped notes into Huth's bag in the semi-darkness.</p>
<p>The news from Huth, and the considerable evidence that Hitler was planning to invade Britain, seemed contradictory. But the result of contact with Huth's friend was that the air raids on Britain were merely a smokescreen to cover Hitler's real, carefully calculated plan to launch a sudden and fierce attack on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Later, Huth's friend notified him that the German war machine was organizing twenty-one old government regions of the Tsarist era of Russia, which had already been established, and that the economic staff for these areas had already been appointed. Bundles of ruble notes had already been printed.</p>
<p>Finally, Huth learned the key points of Hitler's military strategy after contacting the German General Staff through his friend - that is, to divide it into three wedge shapes, the northern, the southern, and the decisive central route, directly targeting Moscow. All preparations must be completed in the spring of 1941. When Huth's reports on all this information reached my office, it was so sudden that I initially thought it was a German "ruse." I gave it to FBI Director Hoover and asked for his opinion. Hoover believed it was genuine. Huth told me of a way to have these reports confirmed by a prominent German exile in the United States, so I asked Assistant Secretary of State Langer to see him to obtain this confirmation, which he did. I also discussed the report with the President.</p>
<p>So I decided that the content of this report should be notified to the Soviet Ambassador Oumansky. I believed that this step was in line with the appropriate attitude that our country should adopt towards the Soviet Union. At that time, on my recommendation, Welles was holding a series of talks with Oumansky to try to eliminate the differences between our two countries, so I asked Welles to bring the information to the attention of the Soviet Ambassador. Welles did so.</p>
<p>When more information came to me from the same source, I gave it to Welles again and asked him to pass it on to Oumansky. He did this on March 20.</p>
<p>Oumansky undoubtedly sent this information to his government, just as he said he would. It is difficult to say what impact it had on Soviet policy. However, only three weeks later, Stalin suddenly signed a non-aggression treaty with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who at the time believed that such a treaty was impossible. Stalin undoubtedly signed this treaty in order to protect himself in the Far East, because he believed that Hitler wanted to attack him in Europe. Moreover, the policies adopted by the Soviet Union towards the Balkan countries before Hitler's plan to bring them into the Axis sphere were stronger than could have been expected.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union stimulated Hitler to engage in a European war in August 1939, and assisted him in invading Poland when Poland was desperately resisting the German army. But since June 1940, it has in many ways interfered with and obstructed Hitler's goals.</p>
<p>The news we obtained that Hitler was planning to invade the Soviet Union was useful when I met with the Japanese. It eliminated any possibility of a Soviet-Japanese alliance, and allowed us to deal with Japan with a stronger attitude than we could have adopted in the opposite situation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the discussions between Oumansky and Welles broke down, or rather, broke down in a sharp exchange. Oumansky always believed that firmness was rudeness, so he was the most difficult to deal with. Moreover, his government sent him here to request that we purchase more important materials, which Oumansky hoped to obtain, but due to our obligations to Britain, we were unable to do so.</p>
<p>On May 14, Oumansky came to see me, looking gloomy. In the first twenty minutes of our conversation, he listed the differences between our two governments. According to him, these differences had been discussed with Welles twenty-two times since the summer, with no results. He then handed me a note signed by himself, talking about a ship full of supplies being delayed from departing for the Soviet Union. His note spoke of our "hostility" and threatened that his government would "draw all necessary conclusions" from our attitude. He then repeated verbally two or three times that our actions were still due to hostility towards his government, and were a personal act of personal hostility.</p>
<p>I stopped him there and said, "When I think of a country, I think more of its people than of its government. Neither I nor my government have any animosity towards the people of any country. Regarding the Soviet Union and its government, neither I personally nor my government has any animosity. Involving individuals in the actions of the government is not only completely inaccurate, but also extremely unfair. I do not want you to leave my office thinking that you have succeeded in placing this accusation on the head of my government, because it is absolutely without foundation."</p>
<p>I said in closing that we have always been friends of the Soviet people, before and after we recognized the Soviet Union in 1933. The conversation was a little more lively at this point.</p>
<p>In the first week of June, we received credible telegrams from our embassies in Bucharest and Stockholm stating that Germany would invade the Soviet Union within two weeks. The State Department sent these reports to Ambassador Steinhardt in Moscow.</p>
<p>Eight days before Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Churchill sent a telegram to the President saying that every source from which he could obtain information led him to believe that a large-scale German offensive against the Soviet Union seemed imminent. He said that if a new war broke out, Britain, based on the principle that Hitler was the enemy it had to defeat, would of course assist the Soviet Union with all the encouragement and anything that could be spared. He assured that he did not feel that a class-conscious political reaction would occur in Britain, believing that the German-Soviet conflict would not put us in a difficult position.</p>
<p>The conflict did not put us in a difficult position, but gave me new hope for overcoming Hitlerism. I kept in constant contact with the President and Welles from White Sulphur Springs, urging us to give the Soviet Union the strongest assurances that we would give it all possible assistance within our capabilities. The President sent Hopkins from London to Moscow to investigate the Soviet Union's needs. Mr. Roosevelt unfroze Soviet funds and decided not to use the Neutrality Act. On August 2, Acting Secretary of State Welles and Ambassador Oumansky exchanged letters in which we allowed "the granting of all possible economic assistance to enhance the Soviet Union's struggle against armed aggression."</p>
<p>On August 4, I met with Oumansky, who brought Soviet General Golykov with him. Oumansky's attitude was very different from his attitude at our last meeting. I told him that when I was not here, especially after I returned, I was very interested in the Soviet Union receiving all the military supplies we could spare. General Golykov said that he had submitted his government's needs to the State Department two weeks ago, but the only result was the shipment of sixty aircraft to the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union most needed anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns. I promised to redouble our efforts to assist and expedite the shipment of these weapons.</p>
<p>While I was talking with the Soviet visitors, the President was holding the Atlantic Conference with Prime Minister Churchill. The Soviet Union attached great importance to this conference. Hopkins also attended the conference. After he gave an optimistic report on the Soviet Union's ability to resist Hitler's aggression, the President and Prime Minister reached an agreement on a statement to be issued to Stalin. On August 13, the President telegraphed this statement to me by radio, ordering me to telegraph it to Moscow.</p>
<p>The two leaders assured Stalin that "We are currently working together to supply you with the supplies you most urgently need in the greatest possible quantity, and many ships fully loaded with supplies have already left our shores, and more ships will set sail in the near future." They suggested holding a conference in Moscow to analyze the Soviet Union's needs, with senior representatives from Britain and the United States attending the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The story of the Atlantic Conference has been told many times elsewhere. This conference was prepared while I was recuperating at White Sulphur Springs, and the President had already left for the conference when I returned to Washington. Mr. Roosevelt had wanted to hold a personal meeting with Churchill for several months. I first learned of this in late May.</p>
<p>On July 28, Welles wrote to me in White Sulphur Springs saying that the conference had been scheduled for August 8, 9, and 10, and told me that if the President wanted to discuss matters beyond purely military issues, he wanted to urge him to bring someone with him, so that the talks and possible agreements could be accurately recorded.</p>
<p>The conference was very successful in enabling the President and Prime Minister to achieve mutual understanding through close personal contact. On the British battleship "Prince of Wales" and our cruiser "Augusta," the two great men began this unique and intimate relationship, which was extremely important in accelerating the end of the war.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Songjiang Searches and Suppresses Remnant Bandits; Ding Xishan Crosses the River and Flees North; Another Group Hides in Yanduntou; Armored Vehicles Patrol to Ensure Railway Safety <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The small number of communist bandits who landed on the coast at the border between Songjiang and Fengxian counties on the 12th of this month have been divided into two groups and are fleeing everywhere after being encircled and defeated by the National Army, security teams, and local self-defense forces. At 11 p.m. the day before yesterday, more than 50 remnant bandits stealthily crossed the blockade line and fled north from east of Tinglin. They secretly crossed the Pujiang River at the Qianbu Jing Ferry, passed through Sijia Bang and Hexiang, crossed the railway between Cuizhuang and Xinqiao, turned west, and were discovered by the local self-defense forces at Maihuaqiao Town, a midway station on the Songsi Highway, 14 li from Songjiang City, at 8 a.m. yesterday. They were immediately attacked fiercely. The bandits were no match and fled to Tangqiao, 3 li from Sijing. At that time, the Qingpu County Self-Defense Force had received the news and rushed to the scene. After a brief encounter, the bandits retreated towards Yushan and Tianma Mountain. The Qingpu County troops followed closely in pursuit. The bandits did not dare to stay in the mountains for long, and the Third District Security Command had dispatched troops to strictly blockade the area west of Tianma Mountain. At about 6 p.m., the remnant bandits began to flee back towards Songjiang County. At about 7 p.m., they reached Shenxiang Township, more than 20 li from Songjiang City. The deputy commander of the ××× regiment of the ××× brigade of the National Army, Zheng Shen, immediately led his troops to suppress them after receiving the news. Another group of more than ten remnant bandits was discovered at Yanduntou, between Zhuangxing and Tinglin, at 5:30 p.m. The first battalion of the ××× brigade of the National Army, together with the self-defense forces of various townships in Punan, is encircling and suppressing them.</p>
<p>The seventh bridge of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway (between Xinzhuang and Xinqiao) and the thirty-fourth bridge (near Shihudang) also showed traces of bandits yesterday. Three screws were removed from the seventh bridge. The First Traffic Police Brigade stationed in Jiaxing and Songjiang, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Police Section of the two railway bureaus, are patrolling day and night to strengthen the security of the Shanghai-Songjiang-Jiaxing line. The captain of the Traffic Police Brigade, Li Boxi, and the chief of the Police Section, Xiang Younan, are staying at Songjiang Station overnight to direct the defense of the railway line. Traffic police and railway police are driving armored vehicles to patrol back and forth all night to ensure the safety of the railway. However, because the armored vehicles are patrolling too frequently, it has affected the train schedule. The 26th express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou was delayed by one hour yesterday because of this. When the train stopped at Zhouwangmiao Station to wait for traffic clearance, some passengers were misled by false rumors and got off the train. They were relieved and returned to Shanghai after the explanation.</p>
<p>Less Than One Hundred Bandits Landed</p>
<p>The authorities received the most reliable information yesterday that the bandits who landed this time were led by the bandit leader Ding Xishan himself. The bandit Ding is now using the pseudonym "Zaici." The deputy bandit leader, Tang Jingfeng, is from northern Jiangsu and is a veteran communist cadre. Under him is the Propaganda Section, whose "section chief" is a Mr. Hu, the "secretary" is a Mr. Wu, and the "staff officer" is Wang Yun, also known as Wang Zuyao (Ding Xishan's nephew), and Yang Zhichao. His troops consist of a special service platoon with thirteen soldiers, led by Tang Jingfeng, and two combat platoons, totaling more than 60 officers and soldiers, all from eastern Zhejiang, Pudong, or Punan. It is also reported that their weapons are very sophisticated, including five light machine guns, each with seven or eight hundred rounds of ammunition, ten Thompson submachine guns, each with more than two hundred rounds of ammunition, one carbine, one fast machine gun, three pistols, more than twenty 38-type and 79-type rifles, each with more than one hundred rounds of ammunition, three grenade launchers, and twelve hundred hand grenades. Their clothing is all gray cotton military uniforms (floral striped cloth lining with black iron buttons). The backpacks they carried were abandoned in the battle of Panjiajiao, and more than a thousand catties of grain were also abandoned. The group of remnant bandits now fleeing in Yushan and Tianma Mountain is led by Ding Xishan. The group hiding in Yanduntou is led by Tang Jingfeng. The former has more than 50 people, and the latter has less than 20 people. Their initial attempt was to land in Punan and hide in the villages of Punan to carry out their organizational work. If they cannot establish a foothold in Punan, they will flee to Taihu Lake via Qingpu, Luxu, and Wujiang.</p>
<p>Platoon Leader Rejects and Reports Deception</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Zhan Xiufeng, a platoon leader from Songjiang who rejected the communist bandits who landed this time. He was the guard of Huang Chaozhi, the former magistrate of Songjiang County. According to him, in June last year, a friend named Wei said that he could introduce him to work on a cargo ship. At that time, Zhan was unemployed and went happily. On June 29 last year, Wei led him to a small port. There was indeed a wooden sailboat there. The wooden boat set sail from the Wusong Estuary the next day after boarding. As soon as it exited the estuary, a motor boat approached. More than a dozen people were transferred from the motor boat, all equipped with guns. One of them was called the boss. The wooden boat then sailed to Jinshanzui, and several more people boarded the boat. After the wooden boat was full, it sailed to Nantangkou, Dongtai County, northern Jiangsu, to land. After landing, they were trained in an unknown quiet village by the sea. The training was not very strict. They exercised for one hour a day and attended political classes for four hours. Life was extremely hard, eating two porridge and one meal a day and living in thatched sheds. On the 10th of this month, they were ordered to mix with veteran communist cadres and go to two sail boats to land. Then, the night before, he deserted when they crossed the blockade line and fled to Songjiang, where he surrendered to the commissioner's office.</p>

<p>[Xinhua News Agency] Bao Lie, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, said in a speech yesterday that the security of the city's periphery is extremely solid. Although a small number of remnant bandits have recently harassed Songjiang County on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, most of them have been wiped out by the powerful troops of the National Army sent by the headquarters. The remaining bandits have now fled in all directions and are not a cause for concern.</p>
<p>In addition, it is learned that the Garrison Department held a garrison meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss ensuring the security of the city.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The rumor that there are remnant bandits wandering around Wusongkou has been refuted by the person in charge of the security brigade of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Department as unfounded.</p>
<h3 id="e81">General Manager of New Sui Company, Zhu Bing, Arrested in the Capital; Planned Escape to Hong Kong, Reported by Northwest Minsheng Company <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] Zhu Bing, the general manager of the New Sui Company who was accused of fraud in a case at the Shanghai Local Court on November 8th of last year and was ordered to post bail but escaped, was arrested in the capital on the 17th. After escaping from Shanghai, Zhu secretly came to the capital and hid under an assumed name at No. 91 Xindu Apartment on Zhongshan East Road, trying in various ways to escape to Hong Kong again. This matter was learned by the Northwest Minsheng Company, which stated that the New Sui Company still owed a huge sum of 35 billion yuan and had not settled it. It then requested the public security authorities to transfer the entire case file from Shanghai and arrested Zhu at 3:00 PM on the 17th. Soon after Zhu was detained, Guang Lu, a legislator from Xinjiang, went to the Daxing Palace Police Station in the Eastern District to request Zhu's release on bail. The police station, considering that the Northwest Minsheng Company's accusation against Zhu was well-founded, did not approve the request. Therefore, the Eastern District Police Bureau transferred Zhu to the Beijing Local Court. Zhu confessed in court that the fifty trucks owed to the Northwest Minsheng Company could not be delivered because the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau had breached the contract. He was willing to donate to the state the portion of the 50 billion yuan that the National Government had previously returned from Sheng Shicai's extortion of the people of Xinjiang, as well as all his new properties. Xinjiang legislator Guang Lu and Hua Sheng, sympathetic to the two, went to the local court again to request Zhu's release on bail pending trial. However, the Northwest Minsheng Company expressed opposition, and the local court authorities also refused permission because Zhu had been accused of fraud involving 4 billion yuan in Shanghai for handling import and export business, which had not yet been settled, and he had once escaped. After a brief interrogation, he was handed over to the court's detention center to await investigation.</p>

They originally wanted to buy some food and things to play with, but later felt that many poor children were pitiful because they couldn't afford to go to school! So, they sent this sum of money to our newspaper office to donate to the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" to help poor young people. Little Brother Gu and Little Sister Gu extended a helping hand to countless out-of-school children, which is worthy of great praise. We hope that all children will be inspired by this example, so that the practice of saving to help with education can spread widely.</p>
<p>Yesterday, dozens of students also came to the office requesting to complete application procedures retroactively. We are very sorry, but due to the limit on the number of places, we cannot provide them with assistance. Also, the Huaming Tobacco Company continues to solicit a large amount of donations for us on the "Air Bookstore" on China Cultural Radio. Here, we extend our greatest respect to Huaming Company, Cultural Radio, and the countless listeners who have helped us.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Case of Police Officer Accusing Students Scheduled for Investigation on the 24th <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Tongji University students Feng Li Wen and Fan Zheng Sheng were previously accused of assault and obstructing official duties by Cai Yan Zuo, a staff member of the North Sichuan Road Police Branch Bureau. Prosecutor Chen Shou Tao is handling the case and has scheduled a court hearing for the 24th of this month. Because Feng and Fan are suspected of being involved in the student unrest and insulting Mayor Wu, they are currently being detained in the police bureau and will be brought in for questioning at that time.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Civil Aviation Administration believes that the current aviation communication radio stations, in addition to those set up by the bureau in various places, are also set up independently by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC). This not only makes it impossible to unify command, but is also almost a waste. Therefore, there has recently been a proposal to organize a joint aviation wireless communication company to merge the three parties' radio stations into a commercial company managed by the Civil Aviation Administration. The company will uniformly supply aviation telecommunications and charge fixed fees to various airlines. This would concentrate human and material resources, reduce the Civil Aviation Administration's financial burden, and improve the treatment of staff. The specific measures have now been drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Office of the Civil Aviation Administration recently issued a public notice in the newspapers to claim four ownerless aircraft parked at Longhua Airport. It is now learned that Cao Shi Ang, the former head of the flight crew of the Da Hua Aviation Company, has come forward to claim them. However, the Civil Aviation Administration requires additional documentary proof and completion of procedures because Da Hua Aviation Company has not been formally established. Da Hua Company failed to start operations last year due to certain reasons, and the four aircraft have been abandoned at Longhua Airport for more than a year. Although the exterior is still intact, it is reported that the internal machinery has been rusted and cannot be flown without major repairs.</p>

Female staff of the Health Bureau have also risen up to assist. As of the end of January, they have collected a total of 399 items of winter clothing and 26,325,000 yuan in cash, which have been submitted to the Shanghai Women's Community Winter Clothing Solicitation Committee for verification, transfer, and distribution to the refugees.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade was ordered yesterday to monitor market transactions in various industries. As a result, fourteen illegal yarn merchants were arrested in the cotton yarn market. Among them, Chen Jun Jie and Wu Jing Si attempted to bribe the arresting officers with 200,000 yuan in legal tender to secure their release but were refused by the police officers. After being taken to the bureau, they were reported to the superiors, and the two will be severely punished according to the law. Also, the Economic Section discovered a Xin Kang Yarn Company on the third floor of Tianlun Building on Nanjing Road yesterday, operating an underground bank business.

<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of multiple employees of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) offices in Beiping being accused of joint fraud was previously reported to the central government. Because the headquarters of the two airline companies are located in Shanghai, the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the case to be handed over to the local court, which in turn informed the local procuratorate to investigate. Prosecutor Ding Chuan En is handling the case and has scheduled to go to CNAC and CATC today to investigate in person. He will summon those involved in the case for questioning in the coming days.</p>

<p>The opening ceremony of the Fifth Session of the First Municipal Council is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. The Secretariat of the Council has been busy with various preparations in recent days. It is reported that this session will focus on discussing the housing rental problem, the tuition fee standard problem, and the problem of conserving electricity. These issues are currently being carefully studied by the relevant subcommittees, and no specific opinions have been put forward yet. As of the 17th, the Secretariat of the Council has received the following six proposals: (1) Proposal by Tian Shu Jun, Shui Xiang Yun, et al., to strictly suppress and stabilize prices, promptly implement a food rationing system, and reduce living expenses. (2) Proposal by Wu Zheng Kuo, Zhu Wen De, Ye Xiang Gao, et al., to limit tuition fees in various schools, take into account general affordability, and promote universal education.

(4) Proposal by Shi Zong De, Chen Pei De, Zhang Zhi Han, et al., to request that the Bureau of Public Works be instructed to remove the fortifications along the roads in the former French Concession to facilitate traffic. (5) Proposal by Zhu Wen De to request the Council to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan to promptly approve the Shanghai Municipal Government's request to allocate the road of the Pudong Zhong Textile Mill (formerly the Pudong Rihua Textile Mill) for use, in order to facilitate traffic across the river.

<p>[Our Dispatch] Municipal Councilors Zhao Yang Xiong and Li Kai Di, et al., at the request of the representatives of the Nanshi District, stated that the Shanghai Chinese Electricity Company often does not follow the regulations for power outages in the Nanshi District, either several nights a week or with irregular shutdowns, leaving users unprepared and extremely inconvenienced. In addition, the district is located in a remote area, and frequent power outages during this severe winter can easily lead to bandit activity. Therefore, they have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Electricity Company requesting attention to finding ways to improve the situation and requesting strengthened power supply.</p>

<p>Lawyer Cheng Meng Ming Provides Pro Bono Defense</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Hu Diya, the chief editor of the China United News Agency who was falsely accused of theft and attempted suicide by taking poison in court the other day, has gradually recovered after being sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment and escaping danger. Lawyer Cheng Meng Ming yesterday wrote a statement for him pro bono and submitted it to the local procuratorate as a defense. In addition to stating the detailed circumstances of the false accusation, he requested that he be not prosecuted according to the law. Hu Diya expressed his hope to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible so that he can appeal to all parties to redress his wrongful accusation. He expressed his gratitude for the sympathy shown by his colleagues in recent days. However, because he has no relatives or friends in Shanghai, he hopes that all parties can provide further assistance with his medical expenses, post-discharge residence, and financial matters.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Three Prisoners Deny Revealing Inside Story of Prison; Warden Kong Expresses Discouragement; Claims the Accusations are False <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yang Guan Shou, Shi Rui Qing, Zhang Yi Xin, and other prisoners detained in Shanghai Prison secretly reported the abuse of prisoners by prison guards. In response, reporters visited Zha Liang Jian, the president of the local court, yesterday. President Zha said, "The court often receives such secret reports, but it is not appropriate to publish them lightly without corroborating evidence. In this case, many of the points in the prisoners' secret report about the prison differ greatly from the facts. It is deeply regrettable that the Central News Agency has publicly published them." Reporters then drove to Shanghai Prison for a visit. Warden Kong Xiang Lin expressed discouragement over this, saying that the allegations in the secret report were not true. He welcomed reporters to enter and visit. The so-called "Wind Wave Pavilion" (i.e., the Harmony Prison) was originally equipped during the old Public Works Department era. Small windows were opened on the roof, which were specially designed for patients with lung disease or bronchitis, that is, for isolation wards. The last time there was a prison riot, some of the troublemakers were transferred to the "Harmony Prison" for isolation. After the situation subsided, they were still returned to their original place of detention.</p>
<p>No One in Harmony Prison; Reporters Visited "Harmony Prison" Yesterday and Found No One Inside. Warden Kong continued to tell reporters that Yang Guan Shou, Shi Rui Qing, and Zhang Yi Xin were all involved in robbery cases and were sentenced by the Garrison Command Military Law Department. Yang was sentenced to eight years, Shi to twelve years, and Zhang to ten years. They often caused trouble in the prison on weekdays. They had a prison riot once last January, and the local court added seven months to their sentences for obstructing official duties.</p>
<p>Interview with Three Prisoners; Afterwards, Warden Kong, in a very frank manner, brought out Yang Guan Shou, No. 3038, Shi Rui Qing, No. 3041, and Zhang Yi Xin, No. 3036, from the prison to have a free conversation with reporters. No one was monitoring them. Shi said: "I have no complaints about the prison. I don't know who wrote the secret report." Yang said: "Half a month ago, I talked with fellow prisoners about being dissatisfied with the facilities of the prison authorities, but I did not write a secret report." Zhang also said that he did not know. While reporters were talking with the prisoners, prisoner No. 911 violated the rules and even punched guard Ma Jing Duan in the face, swelling it. The guards cried to reporters, saying that these criminals were extremely fierce and difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Known for Causing Trouble; Reporters also visited Huang Liang, the chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate, yesterday to inquire whether personnel would be sent to investigate the prisoners' secret report about the prison. Chief Huang said: "According to investigations, these three prisoners are all military criminals who are known for causing trouble in prison. We previously asked the Garrison Command to transfer the three prisoners to the Army Prison, but it was unsuccessful. As for the allegations in the secret report that the guards were retained from the enemy and puppet period, it is found that there are many employees below the level of officials in various agencies who were retained from the enemy and puppet period. It is impossible to dismiss them all one by one. This is not unique to Shanghai Prison. With these two premises, many of the allegations are not entirely true. The local procuratorate does not place excessive importance on this secret report."</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Prison authorities sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency on the 17th, responding to the six points revealed in the prisoners' secret report to the Municipal Council, and stated that the prison is closely watched by both Chinese and foreign observers. All matters must be handled in accordance with the law. The prisoners Yang Kai Shou, et al., are not used to this kind of restraint, so they falsely accuse and confuse the hearing, which affects the reputation of the prison, and it is even more significant if it is transmitted internationally and reprinted.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Lu Wu, Director of the Central Meteorological Observatory, Takes Office; Talks About Reasons Why Meteorological Reports Are Difficult to Be Accurate <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zheng Zi Zheng, director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, has resigned, and Lu Wu (see picture), director of the Nanjing Central Meteorological Observatory, has been appointed by the Central Meteorological Bureau to succeed him. He formally took office yesterday. Lu had been researching meteorology at the Academia Sinica for many years and had served as a professor at Zhejiang University. He went to the United States last August to attend the International Meteorological Conference and has just recently returned to the country.</p>
<p>He said that the meteorological reporting work in our region is far behind the United States due to financial constraints. The United States has 750 meteorological stations nationwide, while our country currently has only 118. In addition, due to the lack of telecommunications equipment, only about 80 stations can regularly report. The United States has 150 stations nationwide that measure weather balloons, while our country currently has only 38, of which only about one-quarter regularly report. The accuracy of meteorological reporting depends entirely on the number of stations and the speed of information transmission. Therefore, with our country's current material resources, it is impossible to achieve 100% accurate weather forecasts. The Central Meteorological Bureau is now paying special attention to the meteorological reporting work in Shanghai and is determined to start by strengthening technology and strive for accuracy to ensure the safety of air and sea transportation.</p>

<p>After the Lunar New Year, prices continue to rise, especially for fuels such as coal, gasoline, and diesel, which have increased the most. Shipping companies in the city increased passenger and freight rates by 50% on January 15th. Now, only one month later, they feel that they are not covering costs, so they intend to increase them again by 39% based on the proportion of various expenses. The Shipping Association also sent Hu Shi Yuan, Zhong Shan Dao, Cheng Yu Zhai, and Li Yun Liang to Beijing a few days ago to request approval from the Ministry of Communications. It is now learned that, except for Li Yun Liang, who is still staying in Beijing to await the Ministry's approval, Hu Shi Yuan and others have returned to Shanghai. The adjustment of freight rates may be decided within the next two days.</p>

It was decided to adopt a trial implementation method first and then supplement the legislative procedures. It is now learned that at today's regular meeting of the PACC, Zhao will report on the process of attending the meeting in Beijing for discussion.</p>

<p>The long-established Hanyeping Coal and Iron Mining Company lost its rights and interests and was on the verge of bankruptcy before the war because it repeatedly borrowed huge amounts of Japanese debt without authorization, mortgaging all of its factory and mining assets and the underground reserves of the Daye Iron Mine to Japan. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was exploited by the enemy. After the victory, in order to rebuild the steel industry in Central China, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Resources Commission to form the Hanyeping Corporation Asset Liquidation Committee to liquidate the company's assets and Japanese debts. It is reported that the company's Shanghai headquarters was taken over on the 16th by personnel sent by the Committee, who are now beginning to handle the inventory.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau's case of auditor Gao Shi Jie, et al., extorting money from various Chinese-style wood furniture businesses was sentenced by the Criminal Division of the local court on December 12th of last year. However, another employee of the Direct Tax Bureau, Feng He Qian, was also involved in the case, but the local procuratorate did not send Feng He Qian's criminal information to the Criminal Division of the local court. The president of the court previously sent a letter to the local procuratorate requesting that Feng He Qian's case be reinvestigated. The local procuratorate then sent bailiffs to Feng's residence at No. 15, Lane 69, Ganshi East Road to arrest him. Unexpectedly, Feng had already fled. Subsequently, Xu Ze Zou, the principal of Ronghai Middle School, Feng's guarantor, was held accountable. The local procuratorate summoned Xu once on the 4th of this month and gave him ten days to hand over Feng. Yesterday, Xu was summoned again, and because he still could not hand over Feng, he was given another ten days and ordered to provide a shop guarantee.</p>

<p>— Li Hanhun</p>
<p>I set out with the delegation, with two objectives: one, to seek a good doctor to operate on an ear ailment that has hindered my hearing for thirty years; and two, to study the postwar reconstruction of various European and American countries. Just after the New Year of the Republic of China, the 36th year, when the winter plum blossoms had just begun to open and the waves of Nanpu were clear, I took the "General Gordon" ship and crossed the Pacific Ocean from Shenjiang, stepping onto the New Continent. After settling various matters, I was able to proceed with the primary purpose of this trip, the treatment of my ear ailment. The doctor used the latest surgical procedure, drilling a small hole in my left ear directly to the auditory nerve. When the central nervous system failed, heaven and earth were dark, and the universe seemed to turn upside down. After five months, although my hearing had recovered, my head was still slightly dizzy. The doctor was away on summer vacation and instructed me to travel in a timely manner to relax and broaden my mind. Therefore, taking advantage of my wife Ju Fang's summer vacation at Columbia University, I invited her to serve as my interpreter and made a European tour together. We visited thirteen countries, including England, Norway, Sweden (Denmark), the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Morocco, France, Germany, and Switzerland. Observing the historical relics, social phenomena, and postwar measures of these countries, there are many things that we can learn from. Thanks to the extensive assistance of embassies and consulates in various places, friendly people, and fellow overseas Chinese, and with careful budgeting, I was able to conduct a more in-depth exploration in the most economical time. I am deeply grateful for their kindness and hospitality. After returning to New York, I had some free time, so I drafted "A European Diary," seeking correction from the world, in order to report one gain from my special guidance and inspection, and to express my heartfelt gratitude. The doctor said that the ear ailment still needs further treatment. Once my hearing is completely clear, I will complete a tour of the United States. If time permits, I will write a "Diary of the American Continent" to seek correction from experts. (Li Hanhun in New York, December 25, 1947)</p>
<p>Queen Mary</p>
<p>It was August, the scorching sun was shining brightly. At 3 p.m., I stepped onto the "Queen Mary," docked at Pier 90 in New York. With relatives and friends seeing us off, and songs of farewell being sung frequently, a feeling of parting was evoked. At 4 p.m., the ship set sail, leaving the bustling city of densely populated skyscrapers and entering the vast ocean where the sky and water meet. The sea was vast and boundless, and the clear breeze filled my heart. Having spent half a year in a noisy environment recovering from illness, I felt as if I had entered a fairyland. Ju Fang and I unbuttoned our collars, let our hair down, and stood at the bow of the ship, refreshing our minds for a long time. At that moment, I felt a sense of floating and wanting to become immortal.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese on board were Professor Zeng Zhaolun and Gan Guangyi and his mother. Zhaolun is a famous chemistry expert who came to the United States before me. He is now going to England to lecture at the invitation of a British cultural organization. Thousands of miles away, we were on the same boat, reminiscing about the past and discussing new ideas, which dispelled a lot of loneliness during the journey. The "Queen Mary" is the fastest ship in the world, and this was only the second time it sailed from the United States to England after the war. It has a tonnage of 82,500 tons, second only to its sister ship "Queen Elizabeth," and employs more than 900 workers. The passenger seats are divided into three classes, with 700 seats each for first and second class, and 800 seats for third class. The first-class fare from New York to England is 495 US dollars, with adjustments depending on the location and facilities. A single room costs 743 US dollars. Second class starts from 250 dollars, and third class starts from 160 dollars. The ship has ten decks, namely 1. Sun Deck, 2. Promenade Deck, 3. Main Deck, 4. A Deck, 5. B Deck, 6. R Deck, 7. C Deck, 8. D Deck, 9. E Deck, 10. F. Deck. The observation deck and the bottom cabin are not included. There are twelve elevators. In addition to the general facilities such as a large restaurant, smoking room, bar, lounge, and washroom, there are also a library, writing room, photography room, badminton court, billiard room, ping-pong table, movie theater, grocery store, post office, telegraph office, customs office, immigration office, hospital, swimming pool, sunbathing area, children's playground, and dog kennel. The scale is magnificent, and everything is available. Passengers boarding this ocean skyscraper feel like they have entered a metropolis, giving them a sense of being at home.</p>
<p>Time on the ship passes easily. From morning to night, regular meals and tea are spaced out at intervals. Games and entertainment are arranged according to individual preferences, making people completely forget the loneliness of the journey.</p>
<p>The first-class cabins are equipped like first-class hotels in New York, with exquisite furniture and bedding. Although the rooms are smaller than those in a typical hotel, they are delicate and charming, making them worth cherishing. The first-class restaurant can accommodate more than 300 people, with 150 waiters, one servant for every two guests, fully demonstrating the aristocratic style of England. At dinner, many people wear formal attire, with tailcoats waving, displaying a refined demeanor. Women wear long gowns with bare chests, also in the style of British aristocratic women. Although the facilities in the second and third class rooms and restaurants are less luxurious, they are very clean.</p>
<p>The Immigration Bureau handles entry procedures on the ship, which is much more convenient than standing and waiting on the dock in San Francisco. Americans like to learn from the strengths of the British, but the American Immigration Bureau cannot emulate the British in this regard and often causes many troubles for foreigners arriving in the United States, especially Chinese, upon arrival.</p>
<p>The journey was smooth and calm, reminding me of the comfort I felt when crossing the Pacific Ocean. In fact, this trip was also due to the ship's great power and strength, which was enough to calm the winds and waves. Spending five days and nights on the ship, I not only did not feel any discomfort, but also felt that the ship was traveling too fast. Meditating in the quiet room, I thought that I might not have another opportunity to ride this world's most magnificent ship, leisurely enjoying the ocean and appreciating the prosperity and happiness at sea. The world economy is so depressed after the war, and England is also very difficult, but the Queen Mary can still maintain its former grandeur, which shows that there are many contradictions in the world, and the British dominance at sea before the war, their attitude, and their commercial skills can be seen from this. At 10 p.m. on the fifth day, the ship arrived at the southern dock of England (Southampton). Looking at the banks of the Thames River in the distance, the lights were reflected, and the city shadows were blurred, breaking the quiet atmosphere of the sea and revealing the tense emotions of passengers arriving at their destination.</p>
<p>Stepping into England</p>
<p>Leaving the "Queen Mary" and stepping onto English soil, I met with staff from the Embassy and learned that train and hotel accommodations had been arranged. Soon the train departed, and I saw farmhouses on both sides, the scenery vaguely familiar. Entering the city area, broken walls and ruins, the traces of war, could still be discerned. The train arrived at Waterloo Station in London, and I stayed at the Mount Royal Hotel. After settling in, I spread out a map and discussed a two-week tour plan with Ju Fang.</p>
<p>I visited Ambassador Zheng Futing at the Embassy, reminiscing about our separation and discussing the general situation at home and abroad. The current situation and recent measures of British society were the main topics of conversation. Both lunch and dinner were at the Embassy. After the meal, we went out for sightseeing, accompanied by staff from the Embassy during the day and by Ambassador Zheng himself in the evening. On the first day, we took a whirlwind tour of the city area, and then revisited the important places. The host's kindness was very touching.</p>
<p>At the Embassy, I visited the memorial room for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's imprisonment. On the walls were portraits of Mr. Sun, the late Chairman Lin, and Kantley. There were also Hu Zhantang's poem and Guo Taiqi's description of the events. The bed, chairs, and utensils in the room were all original. Recalling that the Minister at the time was Zhao Zhaoyuan, the one who lured the Premier was Deng Tingjian, and the ones who reported to Kantley were the English couple, the Kirls, the evil of the treacherous officials surfaced in my mind. The twelve days of imprisonment are an indelible memorial to the Chinese Revolution. Lingering, I could not bear to leave, as if I saw the spirit of the Premier still showing us the great spirit of revolutionaries overcoming dangers and ultimately winning.</p>
<p>Looking up at the Nelson Monument towering in the sky, I seemed to see the great achievements of Nelson defeating Napoleon. Next, I saw the Egyptian obelisk, which seemed to symbolize that ancient Eastern culture had long been transplanted to the British Isles. Then, I saw Buckingham Palace, which was mixed in with the streets and had no special features, and the Victoria Memorial in front of the palace. Is the reason why the British monarchy has been able to maintain its power due to its proximity to the masses? Then, I went to Westminster Abbey. The church is a large building with a grand scale. Many queens, celebrities, and nobles of past dynasties are buried here. The great literary giant Shakespeare also stands prominently as a statue. Is it because the British are proud of this in the world literary world? There is a room inside that requires a ticket to enter, where the coffin statue of the British King is located. The treasures of the dynasties are old and worn out, is it because they deliberately show that they are an old family? I went to St. Paul's Cathedral. The dome of the sky is round, and I was dizzy when I looked up. Many celebrities of past dynasties are buried or have statues here. There is a room underground with even more statues. Wellington is particularly lifelike. The right side of the room was bombed by German planes during the recent war and is currently being repaired with fundraising.</p>
<p>Visiting the British Museum, it is magnificent and beautiful beyond description. Upon going upstairs, I saw many Chinese antiquities on display, including three large bronze bells, two stone beasts, several murals and Buddha statues, bronze tripods, cloisonné tripods, bronze incense tables, and many other types of medieval earth objects. How did they end up here? It was jarring and heartbreaking, unbearable to look at. In addition, there are also antiquities from Greece, Rome, and the Near East. Because of the short time and the intense emotional impact, I did not look at them in detail and left immediately.</p>
<p>At the Wax Museum, the statues are very lifelike, and it is difficult to distinguish between the real and the fake. The rooms on the second floor are mostly divided by category. There are statues of British queens, famous prime ministers, and famous generals of past dynasties. Napoleon, Washington, Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, and others each have a dedicated room. On the third floor, there are many stories and a statue of Hitler. Finally, in the basement, there are displays of ancient tortures and crimes, which are chilling.</p>
<p>Hyde Park is a cool oasis in the bustling city and a hotbed of political debate. Because it is near my residence, I often visit it. I often see speakers standing on small wooden boxes, speaking passionately (interspersed with applause or exclamations from the audience). Whether it is national policy or the grievances of the neighborhood, they speak freely and even debate fiercely. And they are not subject to any interference. Not only do they maintain a gentlemanly demeanor, but they also demonstrate a democratic style, which is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>I hastily glimpsed a corner of London, full of ancient charm. Because there is a lot of business during the day, the streets are mostly deserted by 10 p.m. Coming here from New York, I can't help but feel a little lonely. England has a long history among the Western powers, but from the perspective of a traveler from an ancient Eastern country, it does not evoke a strong feeling of nostalgia. From an American perspective, it seems old and outdated.</p>
<p>Inspecting the East End</p>
<p>Introduced by the Embassy, a certain city councilor guided me by car to the East London area, which was the most heavily bombed during the recent war. The weather was particularly gloomy that day. As we traveled east, the suffering gradually increased. London has a division between rich and poor areas. The East End is poor and the West End is rich. German planes visited the East End particularly often. The bombing targets of the German army were mainly to destroy transportation. The East End is close to the docks and the transportation center of Kunlin, so the poor people suffered the most. London is divided into 28 districts, and the East End has a population of about 300,000. During the war, about 80,000 people were killed in London, and nearly one-third of the victims were in this area. The ashes have not yet been extinguished, reminding me of the scene of rescuing disaster victims after enemy planes bombed Guangzhou when I was in Guangdong. But they have already "prospered," what will become of us! First, I saw the Elizabethan wooden house from the 16th century; then, I saw the streets where the nobles lived in the 18th century. The London City in Greater London includes an area of one square mile in the greater city. Because the greater city was developed from this small city, it is preserved as a memorial. The mayor has a very high status in this area. The Prime Minister must give way when meeting him. The British King must obtain his permission to enter the city. When entering this area for the first time, I saw the old mayor's residence standing at the street corner, facing the National Bank. The small city has a gate, which is used for entry and exit. Now it is abandoned and unused, but the remnants still exist.</p>
<p>Visiting the Tower of London, which began construction in 1066, although it has lost its original function, it stands on the banks of the Thames River. Not only are the walls still intact, but there are also many ancient weapons inside, as well as crowns from past dynasties. The majestic sword aura makes people think of the complementary relationship between emperors and warriors. Seeing the naval memorial iron tablet for the First World War, I was reminded of the majestic appearance of the British navy at the time. The East London Avenue is wide and paved with bricks, reminding people of the traces of the Roman occupation more than 50 years before Christ. The landscape remains the same, but the people have changed. History is merciless, who can forget this?</p>
<p>The scale and spirit of the British are indeed considerable. At a time when the economy is extremely difficult, there is a whole plan on the ruins of the East End to build dozens of low-income housing units ranging from two to seven stories. The method is that all bombed houses that cannot be rebuilt by the residents themselves and are suitable for public use are purchased by the government. The costs of purchase and construction are borne by local taxes and national subsidies. These new houses are given priority to newlyweds, the sick, and families of veterans. I visited several households and saw that the living room, bathroom, and gas heating were all well-equipped. Then I visited the district nursery, which specializes in accepting children from one month to five years old. The daily fee is one shilling, and the government subsidizes one and a half pounds per week. The distribution of milk to adults in London is minimal, but it is very sufficient for children. In addition, the facility is well-equipped, and the management is thorough. The children are all very fat and happy. Because Ju Fang was entrusted by the Ministry of Social Affairs to investigate children's welfare undertakings, she paid special attention to this.</p>
<p>Visiting Chinatown, I heard that there are more than 2,000 overseas Chinese in London, most of whom used to live here; most of them are poisoners. Although it has been severely destroyed after the bombing, the overseas Chinese still greeted us with bitter smiles. The Seamen's Union and the Righteous Industrial and Commercial Association are located here. Mr. Gu Genfu, the person in charge of the association, said that the current Seamen's Union has more than 1,000 people, who come and go from time to time. Their wages, excluding food and accommodation, range from 12 to 18 pounds per month. Their work mainly involves stoking fires, cleaning, and serving as waiters and sailors. Life is quite difficult. During the recent war, ships from various countries were forced to gather here, and about 30,000 overseas Chinese sacrificed their lives while serving, which is also a significant number.</p>
<p>The slums of the East London area have attracted the attention of people all over the world. A hundred years ago, professors from Oxford and Cambridge universities lived in this area for a long time, investigating the lives of the poor and seeking ways to improve them. Marx's theory of the proletarian revolution was mostly based on this. The rise of the British Fabian Society also originated here. Both belong to socialism. The difference is that Marx believes that the transition from capitalism to communism must take the path of violent revolution and must go through the stage of the dictatorship of the proletariat; the Fabian Society believes that the transition from capitalism to socialism can be achieved through rational persuasion and can be achieved through the representative system without bloodshed. The latter is the source of today's British Labor Party's theoretical foundation. After the tour, the tragic bombing of the East London area and the historical facts of social evolution filled my mind and swirled around, preventing me from sleeping all night. I got up and read the third lecture of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Dawn broke in the east, and I finally fell asleep.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Haiyan, 16th] The Datong steamboat from Jiaoli Weir to Xiaoshi in this county capsized in Jiaohe the day before yesterday afternoon. Because 70 or 80 passengers from Ganpu were transferring to Shanghai, but the Datong steamboat was too small to accommodate so many passengers, they managed to borrow a small boat to attach to the side. However, because the attached boat was even smaller than the original steamboat and carried a lot of people, at about 2 p.m., when the steamboat arrived at Kuabu Bridge (close to Xia), a ticket seller jumped from the steamboat to the towboat at the back to sell tickets. The towboat suddenly capsized, and all the passengers fell into the water. After making every effort to rescue them, all of them came ashore after more than ten minutes. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Americans Are Very Interested in the Taiwan Issue <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Taipei, 11th] According to Mr. Xia Zhihua, who recently returned to the nest from the United States: Americans are very interested in the Taiwan issue and express deep concern. During the war, Princeton University established the Taiwan Research Institute under the Navy, with up to 2,000 students. At that time, a detailed plan was drafted for the Allied forces to take over after landing. After the victory, Taiwan was incorporated into China, and this plan could not be realized. Currently, universities in the United States that have applied to establish research institutions on Taiwan include the University of Washington in Seattle, which has a Far Eastern Department. The head of the department is an expert in Eastern problems in Europe. Kerr (G. Kerr.), who was the American Vice Consul in Taiwan, is also a short-term professor. He mainly teaches Japanese history and Taiwanese history. Because he spent a long time in Taiwan and personally experienced the 228 Incident, he provides a lot of information about Taiwan. However, it is regrettable that his published topics on Taiwan seem to be biased and fail to objectively report the facts. He even insulted mainland personnel coming to Taiwan. Mr. Xia attended a symposium convened by Kerr in a private capacity. Most of the questions he raised were disagreed with, and Mr. Xia answered truthfully. Another institution studying Taiwan is the Chinese Gang Library at Harvard University, which is divided into Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese border research. The research on Tibet and Xinjiang border provinces is very detailed. The research on Taiwan focuses on the language and racial origin of the Gaoshan people. A pure academic study is conducted on the 88,748 people scattered in the deep mountains using ethnology and anthropology. They also plan to send experts to Taiwan for field investigations, hoping to work with famous scholars in this province to conduct joint research and exploration. Professor Li, who used to teach at Qinghua University, also participated in the research at the university. These two universities have special lectures on Taiwan, which fully shows the concern of the Allied nations for Taiwan.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Qingdao Port: Construction Project Underway <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 17th] Since the Ministry of Transportation established an engineering bureau in Qingdao last year, it has been vigorously carrying out the construction of the Sixth Pier. Repairing the fender timbers and other projects on various piers in the port have also been completed successively. The Fifth Pier, which collapsed the year before last, is using a steel sheet pile plan, which has been actively planned for a year. Currently, the steel sheet piles have been ordered from the Bethlehem Steel Plant in the United States and have been successively shipped directly from New York to Qingdao. Each steel sheet pile is six point four meters long and weighs two and a half tons, totaling approximately three thousand tons. Other necessary materials have also been prepared one after another. At the end of last month, famous Shanghai-Nanjing construction company representatives, whose qualifications had been reviewed and approved, flew to Qingdao for on-site surveying and estimation. Bidding was opened at the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing on the 9th of this month, presided over by Counselor Jin Shi-xuan. Bureau Chief Song Xi-shang, Chief of the Public Works Section Gao Zong-yi, and Engineer Zhang Bao-tian also went to Nanjing to assist. The winning bidder was the China United Engineering Company. The contract will be signed within days, and the entire project is expected to be completed within eight months. The construction methods for this project largely utilize new machinery, making it arguably the most significant and challenging construction project in the country this year.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Taiwan Province's Adopted Daughter System Urgently Needs Attention and Improvement <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 10th] The "adopted daughter system" ("sim-pu-á" in the Taiwanese language), which has persisted in Taiwanese society for decades, was not banned during the Japanese rule and has become even more prevalent since the retrocession. These adopted daughters only have two paths: one is to be forced into prostitution, selling their bodies, and the other is to work as domestic servants. Those familiar with the situation say that during the Japanese era, the market price for an adopted daughter was three hundred yuan, with the highest price being ten yuan. Currently, the market price for a beautiful young girl aged fifteen to eighteen is generally 60,000 legal tender, with the highest price being 80,000 legal tender (equivalent to 8.16 million of this currency). In these human transactions, both parties hold contracts. Those sold into prostitution stipulate "the seller is not responsible for what happens afterward." Those sold as domestic servants stipulate "the buyer is responsible for taking care of the girl until she grows up and gets married." Recently, many disputes have arisen from this unreasonable adopted daughter system. It is generally believed that the "disease" of "existent in all provinces, but uniquely abundant in Taiwan Province" urgently requires attention and improvement from the women's community.</p>

<p>Yunchong Girls' School Tuition Fees</p>
<p>Parents Call for Reduction</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A group of parents of students at Yunchong Girls' School in this city held a press conference at the Meilongzhen Restaurant yesterday afternoon to report the situation. According to reports, "Students at the school received fee payment notices from the school a few days ago, requiring payment between the 17th and 20th. Junior high school tuition and fees are 4.6 million legal tender, and senior high school tuition and fees are 5.8 million legal tender, which is much higher than the municipal government's regulations of 3.2 million for junior high school and 4 million for senior high school. Students' parents are unable to afford this, so they have formed a parents' association and are calling for four points: (1) Request Mayor Wu to reduce tuition fees and order all schools to strictly enforce them. (2) Before the above request is fulfilled, Yunchong students will pay 4 million legal tender first. (3) All Yunchong parents will postpone paying fees. (4) Increase teachers' salaries and provide them with in-kind benefits."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the appeal by parents of Yunchong Girls' School regarding the school overcharging fees, this reporter inquired with Director Li of the Education Bureau, who said, "If any school overcharges fees without prior approval from the Education Bureau, we will definitely order them to refund the money. Parents of students at all schools can report such schools that violate government regulations to the Education Bureau at any time. The Education Bureau will send personnel to conduct spot checks on fee collection at various schools in the near future. All schools must also meet the requirement of a 25% free quota. If the school feels it cannot afford the 25% free quota, it may apply to the Education Bureau for subsidies."</p>
<p>In addition, Director Li stated that he had approved the exemption of the 1 million legal tender teacher advancement fee requested by students of the Municipal Teachers' College.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Director Li Ximou of the Municipal Education Bureau is scheduled to host a public banquet at the International Hotel at noon today for the representatives attending the National Catholic Education Conference. Secretary-General Shen of the Municipal Government will attend on behalf of Mayor Wu at that time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Tuesday was the third day of the National Catholic Education Conference, which was still held in the auditorium of Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences on Changle Road in Shanghai. In the morning, Li Daonan, Principal of Shangzhi Middle School in Hankou, spoke on "The Economics of Catholic Schools," and Xi Pinmei of the Shanghai Diocese Education Committee spoke on "The Conditions that Faculty and Staff Should Have in Teaching, Morality, and Religion." In the afternoon, Zhang Boda, Principal of Xuhui Middle School, spoke on "Social Education in Boys' Schools," and Zhou Weicheng, Principal of Qiming Girls' School, spoke on "Social Education in Girls' Schools," all with insightful remarks.</p>
<p>Public Meeting Tomorrow The general meeting on Wednesday will feature a speech by Ying Qianli, Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, on "The Contribution of Catholic Education to Social Education." The public meeting will begin on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>"Another dispatch" Li Daonan, Principal of Shangzhi Middle School in Hankou, made the following remarks to reporters regarding the future of Catholic education: The Catholic Church aims to civilize all people. Among the strategies for civilizing all people, the most appropriate and practical in China's current situation is to establish schools. Every school is the best stronghold. Through this stronghold, there are opportunities to proclaim doctrine and civilize humanity anytime, anywhere. However, the degree to which the function of civilization is exerted depends on the quality of school education. In order to reap high effects on the mission of civilizing humanity, Catholic education must not only increase the quantitative aspects, but especially require more numbers. According to the 1947 Chinese Missionary Area Yearbook published in Shanghai: There are a total of 2,298 Catholic primary schools, 340 senior primary schools, 128 junior and senior high schools, and 3 universities. This statistic, in proportion to the number of four million believers in China's 140 dioceses, shows that Catholic schools are indeed too few in quantity. What's more, the target of Catholic education is not only the children of a few believers, but must reach the youth and children outside the Church, so the quantity must be increased.</p>
<p>Restore the Foundation System At present, the maintenance of Catholic schools is 100% dependent on tuition income. Under the threat of inflation and rising prices, it is a major question whether tuition income alone can continue to sustain them. Therefore, in order to consolidate the survival of the schools, another method must be established. According to my personal opinion, the best method is to restore the foundation system. However, even with the foundation system, it must be used well. The best way to use it is for each secondary school to have an affiliated hospital, using its profits to support the secondary school's expenses. Not only does the secondary school receive economic support, but the hospital itself is also a missionary stronghold, which can have a dual meaning for the civilization of all people. In addition, the Catholic Church Affairs Promotion Committee should also raise large sums of money to subsidize primary and secondary schools with good performance in various regions, and to help dioceses lacking schools or without schools to establish primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Distribute the Teaching Network After the economic problem has a solution, a Catholic school teaching network should be established. The distribution of the teaching network should at least establish an official primary school in each parish or large congregation, at least establish an official senior primary school in each deanery, at least establish official junior secondary schools for both boys and girls in each diocese, and at least establish official senior secondary schools for both boys and girls in each ecclesiastical province. In addition, universities should be established in Central China, Western China, Southern China, and Northeast China. If Catholic education economics are fully grasped, and if a Catholic education network can be established, I think that the effect of the Catholic mission in China for more than 300 years will be easily made more significant and developed immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Legal Does Not Permit Test Cadaver Dissection China Anatomical Society Petitions Central Government for Remedy <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Anatomical Society, which was established not long ago, finds that due to the nation's adherence to customs, people are unwilling to allow corpses to be used for dissection after death, and this is also not permitted by law. As a result, there is a severe shortage of corpses for experimental dissection needed for medical education in our country. Universities and research institutes are all suffering from a lack of resources to meet urgent practical needs. The Society will submit a formal document to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to seek remedies as soon as possible and will suggest drafting measures to the Legislative Yuan for legislation. Professor Lu Yudao, the person in charge of the Society, stated: The test cadaver dissections in medical colleges are of great importance to medical education. As far as he knows, the authorities of medical colleges and universities today are all anxious about this problem. Before the war, the test cadaver dissections used by Peking Union Medical College were borrowed from Jinling University in Nanjing. After the war, Jinling University also felt a shortage. Recently, most schools have borrowed them from the National Defense Medical College, but the number is very small and insufficient. Mr. Lu believes that this is due to the fact that our country has not legislated, so even ownerless abandoned corpses cannot be used for experimental dissection. However, the general custom in our country is that individuals and their families do not want their bodies to be dissected after death, which is the biggest reason. Mr. Lu said: Experimental dissection is divided into two types, physiological and pathological. Westerners who die from illness often leave instructions to their families to ask doctors to dissect the body in order to understand the pathology. The spirit of contributing one's dead body to medical education and benefiting society and future generations is worthy of emulation in our country and should be vigorously promoted.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Skyrocketing Prices Halt Trading: Rice Market in Chaos, Mayor Wu Cables Central Government for Emergency Measures <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rice market was in a chaotic state yesterday due to rising rice prices in the producing areas. Formal trading did not open at the exchange. Off-exchange bids exceeded the 2 million mark. The Bureau of Social Affairs released 5,000 dan each in the North and South markets at a price of 1.75 million. Mayor Wu urgently cabled Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food, requesting immediate emergency measures and ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Wuxi County Government to quickly suppress rice prices in the producing areas.</p>
<p>It is reported that the price of rice in Wuxi production area had reached 1.96 million the afternoon before yesterday. The reason for such a rise is that Xu Zhou merchants were buying in large quantities there. The purchase quantity is calculated by train, each car can hold about 15 tons of rice, and there are a total of ten cars. Mayor Wu contacted County Chief Xu of Wuxi by long-distance telephone yesterday, asking to suppress local prices. County Chief Xu immediately took charge of the local rice market and stopped the ten cars of rice being purchased, limiting the price of rice in Wuxi to 1.65 million yuan. It is expected that the market in this city will also be stabilized within one or two days.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Demand Suppression of Production Prices</p>
<p>Mayor Wu met with rice merchants yesterday afternoon, and the rice merchants demanded suppression of production area prices. Mayor Wu said that he has asked the central government and the government of the producing area to take this measure. He hoped that the rice merchants could cooperate with the government and that market transactions would not exceed 1.8 million. Mayor Wu is also studying the technical problems of rice sales because the government's rice sales may be entirely absorbed and hoarded by rice merchants, and will issue a statement today.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Sells 10,000 Dan of Rice Daily</p>
<p>Another report: Mayor Wu told reporters last night that this rice price surge was purely affected by price fluctuations in rice-producing areas. Mayor Wu specifically requested the central government yesterday to immediately order each producing area to find ways to control rice prices. The municipal government is still ordering the Bureau of Social Affairs to continue to sell 10,000 dan of rice per day to meet market demand.

<p>Although the foreign firm tea market was still quiet yesterday, the Benjie and various gangs continued to inquire about various types of tea. Shop owners still believed that because the production and inventory were depleted and the rising rice prices made people feel even better, bidding was frequently raised. Until the market closed, give and take negotiations were still stuck in a mutual holding pattern, and red trading was difficult to start, but the trend was brilliant and extraordinary, and prices were further increased compared to before.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw excellent sales in the morning because the door stores were selling well. Fellow businesses continued to buy and were still smooth.

<h3 id="e157">Concealed Reporting of Straw Hats for Export Discovered by Jianghai Customs <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] At the beginning of January this year, it was rumored in this port that an export firm organized smuggling and concealed reporting of straw hats for export, which was detained by the customs. Although this matter has been silent for many days, the relevant authorities have secretly investigated the truth. They first started to turn over the information in the export license application forms of the designated banks that the suspected firm usually dealt with. It was discovered that the straw hats detained by the customs were owned by Fuyuanhua Firm and Xilun Firm. The total number was 8,300 dozen Suzhou hats and 300 dozen golden silk straw hats, with a total value of approximately US$70,000. Because there was a trick of reporting more for less and mixing low-value straw hats with high-value goods in order to secretly exchange foreign exchange, the Jianghai Customs detained them. As for the merchants involved in the inquiry, it is said that they have been found to be uninvolved, and the competent authorities are thoroughly investigating those who have actually engaged in smuggling.</p>
<h3 id="e158">China Textile Construction Actively Sells, and Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] In recent days, the cotton cloth market has been firm due to loose money. The China Textile Construction Company has been actively selling cotton cloth since the Lunar New Year in order to regulate supply and demand. In addition to the cotton cloth sold yesterday, 43,170 bolts of cloth were sold on the 14th, with a value of 66,440,800 yuan; on the 16th, yarn was sold, with 1,523 pieces being sold at posted prices, with a value of 81,196,580 yuan. 1,435 pieces were sold on the market, with a value of 69,000,000 yuan. On the same day, woolens were also sold, with a value of 16,200,000 yuan. The total value of yarn, cloth, and woolens sold in two days was 232,830,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market yesterday was stable at the beginning. Later, due to the activities of outside funds, bids rose again. Although the China Textile Construction Company was still listing prices and accepting applications from fellow businesses in the middle of the way, the market sentiment was slightly soft. Soon, the price rose again because the Benke gang had good real needs and most people were optimistic. The 42-count blue phoenix fine yarn actually sold for more than 720,000 yuan, reaching a new peak of 70.6 million yuan. At the close of the day, it continued to rise by 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous day. The 21-count black horse spot goods were absorbed by all parties, reaching a high of 46.7 million yuan, a further increase of 2.4 million yuan. The other coarse and fine yarns all rose by varying amounts of 700,000, 800,000, and 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Yarn Control Committee continued to entrust the China Textile Construction Company to sell yarn at the Yarn Industry Association yesterday. The total number of yarn sold was around 1,100 pieces, equivalent to approximately 1,700 pieces of 20-count yarn. The prices of each grade of 20-count yarn ranged from 42 million yuan to 44 million yuan. The purchase permits could not be filled out and issued on the same day and will be issued this morning at 9:00 am.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Yarn Merchants Demand Higher Commissions, Market Suspended Once <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was suspended once yesterday morning, so the prices of each count of yarn were not released until noon. It is reported that the reason for the suspension was the issue of commissions for yarn merchants in cotton yarn transactions. According to regulations, manufacturers and merchants must entrust yarn merchants to the market to complete transactions for buying and selling cotton yarn. The yarn merchants then extract commissions from the number of transactions. The commission calculation was previously set at 50,000 yuan per piece for 20-count yarn, and ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 yuan for yarn above 20 counts. However, because prices have risen in recent years and the price of cotton yarn transactions has also increased significantly, yarn merchants feel that the originally set commission amount is too small. In addition, the number of entrusted purchases and sales is decreasing daily, and daily transactions are only a few packages as a unit, so commission income is even more meager. Before the market opened yesterday, yarn merchants unanimously stated that they would not open for trading unless the commission was doubled, but the other party could not express acceptance, which led to a deadlock in the negotiations, and the yarn market had not opened for trading until 11:30 am. Later, after both parties reached an understanding, it was decided to resume trading first and then negotiate again. Transactions began near noon.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market yesterday morning was strong due to loose money, and the Benke gang and fellow businesses were pulling prices up strongly. Dyeing factories had a strong appetite for low-grade fine cloth. The buying sentiment in the market was strong, and the market rose tortuously. However, after 10 o'clock, because China Textile Construction Company listed prices and started selling Longtou fine cloth, market sentiment suddenly weakened. Retail investors were afraid that the market would be weak and closed out a lot. A few of the North Gang also spit it out, and there was a sudden situation of supply exceeding demand. The market also saw a slight setback. Until the noon close, people were still excited, and the Benjie stores continued to buy, so as a result, only Longtou fine cloth fell back by 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day, at 2.03 million yuan. Low-grade fine cloth such as Wufu Caiqiu Zhenzhong continued to rise from 20,000 to 150,000 yuan because the factory demand was not bad. The trend for the whole day was still strong for the rest of the cloth, except for the relatively weak Qiunzi wool and Zhigong cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Transportation Management Committee Drafts Concrete Measures to Promote Major Export Materials: Producers, Transporters, Salespeople, and Exporters Can All Get Loans <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Transportation Management Committee attaches great importance to developing the export industry and is now considering providing financial loan assistance. It is reported that in the future, financial assistance to the export industry will be divided into three stages. Before the export materials are transported out of the place of production, they can be mortgaged for loans. This is the first stage. From the place of production to the port of export, it can be changed to domestic acceptance, which is the second stage. From the port of export to foreign countries, a discount loan is made, which is the third stage. This will allow exporters to obtain government funds that can be used cyclically in the production, transportation, and sales processes. However, it is limited to important export materials such as silk, tea, tung oil, and pig bristles, and those who do have fixed sales markets abroad. The Transportation Management Committee is drafting specific measures, which can be discussed and implemented in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Rayon Falls, Silk Goods Decline <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market fell. No. 120 Asahi's bright rayon fell within the 100 million yuan mark at the opening in the morning. Market sentiment was quite soft, and trading was extremely slow. At the noon closing, it was bid at 98 million yuan. The largest increase in the afternoon was to above the 100 million yuan mark, but in the end it still fell to 98 million yuan due to uneven supply and demand. Tianqiao, Dongyang, etc. all followed and declined.</p>
<p>Yesterday's factory trade was slightly soft. Five packages of Grade C products were traded for 100.3 million yuan. Five dan heads of grade D origin were actually sold for ten packages at a price of 100 million yuan, which was the same as the previous day's market. No transactions were made for other brands. There were also no transactions for dried tendons. Bids were unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk goods market declined. Because market sentiment was weak, Huaqiang real silk quilt was lowered to within the 6 million yuan mark at the opening. Afterwards, it was in a revolving state. The closing price was 6.2 million yuan. Dacheng checkered crepe first fell to within the 190,000 yuan mark and closed at 192,000 yuan. Huajin crepe and feathers all fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The bids for other goods were mostly unchanged.</p>

<p>The Chinese medicine market has been affected by soaring prices, and prices have been reported to be rising in various places. The mainland uses rice prices as the standard, plus railway transportation and ship freight rates are constantly rising. The cost of incoming goods is increasing step by step, causing drug prices to rise slowly, threatening the poor and the sick.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhejiang gang Yuan Hu Suo's top-grade goods opened at 60,000, but the Exchange Gang looked at the situation and then returned slightly to 40,000 to trade. Bottom-grade inferior goods were 26,000. The transaction was thin. The highest price of Ophiopogon japonicus was 140,000 yuan. The bottom-grade package surface was 44,000, which was considered stable. Western plums, general goods were 60,000 yuan, and there were quite a few transactions.</p>

<p>— Zhang Dao</p>
<p>20. Refugee Hospital Gate</p>
<p>The gate of the Guiyang First Refugee Hospital. Several visitors come and go. A Red Cross ambulance arrives. (This kind of vehicle is just a large truck with a canvas cover.) The hospital staff immediately come out and move the wounded and sick refugees from the vehicle one by one. The first to be moved out is an injured old woman from the countryside. Next is a seriously ill scholar who looks like a university professor, supported by his wife as he gets out of the car and enters the hospital. The last to be moved out is a girl of about eight years old (namely He Xiuzhen), whose leg is injured and is still unconscious.</p>
<p>21. Convalescent Room</p>
<p>After the wounded and sick people are moved into the hospital's convalescent room, Dr. Li Jiren and female doctor Zheng Jingye (Jingye is now thirty-three or thirty-four years old) enter the ward with nurses. They first examine the university professor, then examine the old woman from the countryside. Suddenly, in a corner of the ward, a female patient on a hospital bed screams in pain and shouts loudly, "Has my husband arrived?" The doctors and other patients, wounded, can't help but be disturbed. Dr. Zheng immediately goes over to comfort her. Dr. Li and the nurse walk to the bed of the injured girl. The girl moans in pain. Dr. Li opens her wrapped leg to take a look. At this time, Dr. Zheng also walks over to examine her together.</p>
<p>Jiren: (Speaking to Jingye) This child's leg injury is very serious. It is already very swollen. Surgery is necessary.</p>
<p>Jingye: Yes. We will operate on her immediately.</p>
<p>Jiren: Will you notify the operating room to prepare quickly?</p>
<p>Jingye: Okay.</p>
<p>22. Operating Room</p>
<p>The door of the operating room of the First Refugee Hospital opens. A mobile hospital bed. He Xiuzhen, who has just undergone surgery, is pushed out from inside. Dr. Li is still wearing the clothes he wore during the surgery. He is still wearing a leather glove on his left hand. The mask on his mouth has not been removed. Dr. Zheng is also wearing the same clothes, but the gloves and mask have been removed. Dr. Li stands inside the operating room door, watching Dr. Zheng and the nurse push the mobile hospital bed into a small single room.</p>
<p>Jingye: (Watching the child closely. The child's eyes are closed. She looks very painful. Dr. Zheng sighs and says.) Alas! How pitiful!</p>
<p>Nurse: Will she be disabled?</p>
<p>Jingye: Probably not. Let her sleep.</p>
<p>(The doctor and nurse quietly walk out.)</p>
<p>23. Small Room Ward</p>
<p>(End of December, Year 33 [1944])</p>
<p>After a considerable amount of time has passed, Xiuzhen's (Xiuzhen is now eight years old) leg injury has gradually healed. She is also very awake. She is flipping through a picture book on the bed in a small single ward. Jingye walks into the ward.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (The girl sees Dr. Zheng coming in and smiles.) Dr. Zheng.</p>
<p>Jingye: Does it still hurt?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Thank you, it doesn't hurt anymore. (Smiles, then suddenly looks worried.) Dr. Zheng, will I become a cripple?</p>
<p>Jingye: As long as you listen to me and rest well, you definitely won't be crippled.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I will definitely listen to you.</p>
<p>Jingye: Can you remember many things from before now?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I can remember.</p>
<p>Jingye: Your surname is He, and your name is Xiuzhen?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Yes.</p>
<p>Jingye: How old are you this year?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Eight years old.</p>
<p>Jingye: Where is your home, what are your parents' names?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: My home is in Shanghai, my mother's name is Guo Canyun. My father's name is He Qi.</p>
<p>Jingye: (Hearing the name He Qi, she is very surprised. Suddenly, a little louder.) What? He Qi?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Looking at her a little strangely) Yes.</p>
<p>Jingye: Do you have any siblings?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: No, not one. (Jingye pondered this point for a moment.)</p>
<p>Jingye: How did you get to Guizhou?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: My mother told me that after the war in Shanghai, we moved to Guilin to live. Later, my father went to Singapore and never came back. A while ago, my mother said that the Japanese soldiers were coming to Guilin, so she took me and ran away. Later, our things were lost or robbed. At first, we had a car to ride in, but later the car was gone too. My mother took me and walked with many, many people. One day, we walked to a place. There was an air raid alarm. My mother and I followed the others to escape the air raid. There were too many people. We were separated. Then the bombs exploded with a roar. After that, I don't know anything. (Xiuzhen cried as she said this.) My mother also doesn't know where she went. (She cried even more after saying this.)</p>
<p>Jingye: (Comforting Xiuzhen very kindly.) Don't cry. We have entrusted people to inquire about your mother's whereabouts at various refugee shelters.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Holding Jingye's hand and pleadingly asking.) You will definitely find my mother.</p>
<p>Jingye: I think we will find her.</p>
<p>24. Dr. Zheng's Office</p>
<p>(February, Year 34 [1945])</p>
<p>Dr. Zheng is in the hospital's office. Jingye is absentmindedly holding a photo of a child on her desk. (This photo is the one that Jingye took when she was discharged from the hospital and kept in her handbag.) (Close-up) She looks at the photo while recalling Xiuzhen's appearance. (Flashback to previous scenes.) Suddenly, Dr. Li Jiren brings Mr. Qin Ming from the Social Service Department in. Jingye immediately puts the photo in a book.</p>
<p>Jiren: Dr. Zheng, this is Mr. Qin from the Social Service Department. He is here to talk to you about He Xiuzhen.</p>
<p>Jingye: Mr. Qin, please sit down, Dr. Li, please sit down too. (They all sit opposite Jingye's desk in the office.)</p>
<p>Qin Ming: Dr. Zheng, we have inquired at all the refugee shelters, and we have also published announcements in the refugee service column of the newspaper for many days, but there is still no trace of He Xiuzhen's mother.</p>
<p>Jingye: There is nothing we can do about that. This child is healed now. She is always thinking about her mother. Sigh! This child is really pitiful. What will happen to her after she leaves the hospital?</p>
<p>Qin Ming: I am here today to discuss this matter with both of you.</p>
<p>Jingye: What do you plan to do with her?</p>
<p>Qin Ming: We are now planning to send her to the wartime children's home run by Madame Chiang in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Jingye: Ah! (Seeming surprised and disapproving.)</p>
<p>Qin Ming: Dr. Zheng, what do you think?</p>
<p>Jingye: (Speaking to Li and Qin) Shall we call Xiuzhen in and ask her?</p>
<p>Li Qin: Okay.</p>
<p>Jingye: (Pressing the bell on the desk, a nurse comes in.) Tell her to bring He Xiuzhen here.</p>
<p>Jiren: This child is very lovable, it would be best if someone would adopt her.</p>
<p>Qin Ming: In normal times, many people would want her. Under these circumstances, I am afraid it will not be easy to find a suitable person to adopt her.</p>
<p>(The nurse brings Xiuzhen in, puts her down on the ground. She is holding a small walking stick. She can walk slowly now.)</p>
<p>Jingye: Xiuzhen, can you slowly walk over here?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Um. (Everyone watches her slowly walk to Jingye's side.)</p>
<p>Jingye: Mr. Qin, please tell her.</p>
<p>Qin Ming: Little sister, we haven't found your mother yet. Your injury is almost healed. There are many patients here. We plan to send you to the Chongqing Children's Home. Your mother will come there to find you in the future.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Looking at everyone, not daring to answer. Then bursts into tears.) No! I won't go! I won't go anywhere! If I can't find my mother, I will stay with Dr. Zheng. (Hugging Jingye tightly.)</p>
<p>Jingye: (Very moved.) Stay with me? (Looking at Li and Qin.)</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I want to stay with you, because you treat me well.</p>
<p>Jingye: I am busy taking care of patients all day long, how can I have time to take care of you?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I won't make trouble, I will be obedient, I will cook my own meals, okay?</p>
<p>Jingye: (Very touched, smiling.) Won't you cook for me?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Quickly.) I will, I will.</p>
<p>(Li and Qin look at each other and smile. It seems like they have a new idea.)</p>
<p>Qin Ming: Dr. Zheng, this child is very lovable. It would be very good if you could adopt her.</p>
<p>Jiren: Looking at it this way, I am afraid Dr. Zheng will have to agree.</p>
<p>Jingye: Mr. Qin, this child is both lovable and pitiful. If your department thinks it is okay to entrust her to me for adoption, then I will temporarily adopt her. When her parents are found, I will be responsible for handing her over to them.</p>
<p>Qin Ming: That's great! Let's do it that way.</p>
<p>(Qin takes his leave. Li accompanies him out. Jingye hugs Xiuzhen in her arms. The nurse watches from the side, happy.)</p>
<p>25. Guiyang Bus Station</p>
<p>(May, Year 34 [1945])</p>
<p>Dr. Zheng Jingye resigns from the hospital. She takes Xiuzhen from Guiyang to Chongqing. They are in front of a bus station in Guiyang. A large bus is starting up, ready to depart. Her colleague Li Jiren and several nurses come to the station to see her off. The bus is already full of people. There are still many people with luggage outside the bus who cannot get on, envying those already on the bus. Jingye: (When the bus is about to depart, to the people seeing her off.) Thank you, everyone, goodbye.</p>
<p>(She shakes hands and says goodbye to the people seeing her off individually. She turns to call Xiuzhen. Xiuzhen bids farewell to everyone.)</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Bowing to the people seeing her off.) Goodbye! Goodbye!</p>
<p>Nurse: Goodbye! Xiuzhen! You won't forget me, will you?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: No, Aunt Zhao! (Seeming like she is about to cry.)</p>
<p>Jiren: Dr. Zheng, don't forget to write letters. I hope we will meet again soon.</p>
<p>Jingye: (Smiling to the guests seeing her off.) I hope the war of resistance will be victorious soon. It would be even better if we could meet in Nanjing. (The bus driver urges her to get on the bus.) Okay! Xiuzhen! Get on the bus. Goodbye, everyone!</p>
<p>Jingye and Xiuzhen: (After squeezing into the bus door, the bus departs, and the two wave to their friends seeing them off.) Goodbye!</p>
<p>Friends seeing them off: Goodbye!</p>
<p>The wheels of the bus turn. There is a tattered slogan on the ground that reads "Japanese imperialism," and other words. The wheels roll over it, leaving only the words "Japanese."</p>
<p>26. Chongqing City Street A</p>
<p>(Evening of August 10, Year 34 [1945]) Slogan: Japan Surrenders, Long Live China! (O.S. Sounds of firecrackers)</p>
<p>At this moment, the streets are crowded with people. The masses are celebrating wildly. Many large trucks and small cars are coming and going. They are all filled with people. Allied forces are also driving by in jeeps. Firecrackers are being set off everywhere here and there. The people marching are all beaming with joy, waving their hands and feet. They shout "Japan Surrendered!" "The War of Resistance is Victorious!" "Long Live the Republic of China!" "Long Live the Chinese Nationalist Party!" "Support the National Government!" "Long Live Chairman Chiang!" and other slogans. There are also various large lanterns that have been temporarily set up. On them are written "Celebrate the Victory of the War of Resistance!" and the various slogans mentioned above. After a while, gongs and drums are sounding, and the lion dancers come out. Suddenly, groups of citizens gather into lines, with gongs and drums as guides, and join in. A military band appears, playing military music loudly. Behind them is a large team of armed comrades marching in formation. Many jeeps carrying Allied forces with foreign women or women service personnel from the military appear one after another. The Allied forces mostly stick out their thumbs, saying to the Chinese people, "China is great!" "Chairman Chiang is great!" The people also respond with "America is great!" "The American army is great!" etc.</p>
<p>Some of them are on the vehicles, and some are walking. They are holding bottles and drinking alcohol. Some are also singing various foreign songs together. Many people are vying to shake hands with them. Etc. A lively situation.</p>
<p>27. Chongqing City Street B</p>
<p>(Afternoon of September 3, Year 34 [1945])</p>
<p>The wartime capital Chongqing celebrates the official surrender memorial for Japan's surrender. The great parade of the people of the wartime capital.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang inspects the parade. Receives cheers from the people. Evening celebration with lantern displays, etc. Zheng Jingye takes Xiuzhen to observe on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Jingye: Xiuzhen, did you see Chairman Chiang?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I saw him.</p>
<p>Jingye: He is the great leader who led the Chinese people to defeat Japan.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I saluted him just now, I don't know if he saw me.</p>
<p>Jingye: He will have seen you. Xiuzhen, we are going back to Shanghai soon, are you happy?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Happy! Going back to Shanghai by plane!</p>
<p>Jingye: That's right, by plane!</p>

<p>Ballet Letters</p>
<p>After Hardy's funeral, Barrie (James M. Barrie) wrote a letter to Mrs. Hardy saying, "I want you to know that not only does Hardy's greatness amaze me. Even if he were just an ordinary person - I would still think he is one of the most lovable people I know." Such words can also be used for Barrie himself. His good friends included Mason (A.E.W. Mason), Quiller-Couch, Smith (Turley Smitn), the best writer of children's stories today), Scott (famous for Arctic exploration), Priestley (J.B. Priestley), Lewis (Eiluned Lewis, in 1934 Barrie sincerely welcomed his "Grass on the Dew") and his loyal secretary, Mrs. Cynthia Asquith. They all said Barrie was a happy person; even the "Barrie Letters" now published clearly show that he knew happiness, often enjoyed happiness, no matter how difficult and troubled his life was. He said, "Those who give happiness to others cannot keep happiness for themselves." He said to Mrs. Asquith, "You are not a person who shouts loudly for happiness," which can also be applied to himself.</p>
<p>How endlessly, pleasantly, and happily he gave happiness to people can also be seen from these letters, dating from 1884 to 1937, but unfortunately, there is very little about his early writer life. Most noteworthy is that all the letters have some content, not just reports of careless events.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Barrie himself thought he was a silent child. In 1909, he wrote to Quiller-Couch saying, "I fantasize about creating an artificial world for myself, because the real world I live in seems too melancholic. How stubbornly my pen wants to seek happiness!" The writers he read, besides Hardy, were mostly happy writers. These letters do not talk much about books and authors. He did not like Lawrence (D.H. Lawrence) much, saying that the first chapter of his "The Lost Girl" was too stiff; he praised writers with fluent writing and the best storytellers. He said it should be written out, not forced out. In 1893, he told Quiller-Couch, "That's right! Because this is Hardy's natural product. Indeed, that is everything. Blessedly, this novelist never thought about how he should write." He also told Asquith that Stella Benson's book was too difficult to understand. "She is a brilliant figure with brains, but I simply cannot grasp what her main purpose is in writing this book." What disappoints us is that the letters talk a lot about his own works. He talked about many plays, especially "The Boy David."</p>
<p>The merit of these letters is not easy for readers to know unless they are familiar with his friends and the background of his writing.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this book will arouse readers' interest in studying Barrie, and it is hoped that this book will have a sequel.</p>
<p>Biography of Lafcadio Hearn</p>
<p>Lafcadio Hearn is our acquaintance. His books such as "Literary Interpretation" and "Poets and Poetry" are clear and easy to understand, making you reluctant to put them down after reading them. Recently, Harry E. Wedeck wrote a biography of Lafcadio Hearn, titled "Mortal Hunger," which is a novel-style biography written with great enthusiasm. It tirelessly traces every step of Lafcadio Hearn's journey, from the Greek islands through Paris and New Orleans all the way to Japan. The entire journey is clearly painted with strong colors by Lafcadio Hearn. It is written with genuine emotion, but it is not deeply moving. But Lafcadio Hearn still does not lose his brilliant personality, he is a fearless romanticist.</p>
<p>He was only five feet tall and always a foreigner (later, most tragically, he even entered Japanese customs, he suddenly lost one eye. He understood loneliness. Unfortunately, he could not easily get a large number of reference books in Japan, so it limited the splendor of his works.</p>
<p>Lafcadio Hearn handles his material very well, because he relies on air: for example, Chinese legends ("Several Chinese Ghosts"), New Orleans customs, British and East Indian folklore, and local folk stories.</p>
<p>We must analyze a writer's psychological process. To understand a writer, one must see from the inside to the outside. Wedeck's narrative seems to be superficial. We do not need a bibliographical list, we must say how a certain book was produced, how it was written, and what the author felt when writing. Wedeck has not yet done these things.</p>
<p>Wedeck seems reluctant to take big steps when narrating, and often retreats gently. For example, when writing about Lafcadio Hearn's terrible and strange personal life, the stimulation he received from losing one eye was great. He approached a woman, but Wedeck refused to continue, and closed the curtain. What we want to know is Lafcadio Hearn's reaction to this event in a state of high emotion, but now it is tightly concealed in the silence of the novel biographer, is that not greatly diminished? But we are finally lucky enough to see a sensitive soul under the pen of deep sympathy. He is perpetually pursuing, perpetually wandering, gesticulating and talking a lot, with a bit of foolishness, mostly out of sincerity, he is a sensory adventurer. If Wedeck could handle this biography more objectively, his achievements would be even greater, and he would have more important things to say.</p>

<h3 id="e169">My Views on Banning Dancing <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>I recently saw in the newspaper that the Municipal Social Security Promotion Association held a standing council meeting and decided to "seek opinions from all walks of life on the issue of banning dancing and submit them to the central government for reference." I have long wanted to speak on the issue of banning dancing, and now I want to speak "opportunistically."</p>
<p>The reason for banning dancing, according to the newspaper, is for "economy." Saving what? Saving energy? Dancers are probably expending energy, but what other use will they and she be moved to if they are saved? What good is it to the country and society if a fire breaks out? Saving money? That is even more unnecessary. For individuals, saving money is appropriate, but the purpose of the country's vigorous economy should be to avoid wasting scarce materials, for example, there is very little gasoline left, so order Shanghai to stop using cars for a week, starting with the mayor, there is not much coal left, so tell all agencies to stop using stoves and stop burning water heaters for two weeks, ... this is true economy, very beneficial to the country, because these things are used less and less, and cannot be used and still be there. The banknotes in the people's pockets are not like that. Dancers use them, dance girls and dance hall workers get them, and the total amount must not be short one cent or one dime, let them trade and retreat, each gets what they want, and fundamentally what is the damage to the country?</p>
<p>Therefore, from the point of view of economy - a true economy that helps the national economy - there is no need to ban dancing. If it is said that foreign wines and foreign cigarettes are inevitably sold in dance halls, and dance girls inevitably apply foreign greasepaint and powder, which will waste foreign exchange, then may I suggest: to truly save foreign exchange, please ban the screening of foreign films first, or at least implement it at the same time as banning dancing.</p>
<p>Finally, a statement: I have never danced in my life, and none of my family members or friends rely on dancing for a living, so the opposition to banning dancing is purely public-spirited, with no selfish intentions, just as the gentlemen who advocate banning dancing did not suffer from dancing and came up with this, and are indeed sincerely for the country.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Auspicious Words <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>The magpie and the crow are both small birds with unremarkable appearances. The magpie is liked for its melodious singing, which makes it a beloved animal. The crow, despite its glossy black feathers, is considered inauspicious because it often caws obnoxiously at the wrong time, and thus never receives the master's favor or reward. People always like to have their praises sung; who would perversely enjoy listening to unpleasant noise and curses?</p>
<p>For example, during these days of the New Year festival, everyone wants to have good luck. Those whose luck was bad last year hope to have good fortune from now on, and those who had a decent year hope to make further progress this year. Whether it's family members or colleagues you meet daily, the first words you hear are no longer discouraging phrases like "can't survive" or mentions of "firewood, rice, oil, and salt." Instead, they're replaced with auspicious phrases like "Congratulations, congratulations" and "May everyone prosper." Even if it's clear that the other person's situation is hardly cause for celebration, and even if you know you'll never become rich in your lifetime, you still offer good wishes and prayers. You have to force a smile, especially if you've read the classics in your youth and adhere to Confucius's principle that "a gentleman is refined after possessing both substance and cultivation." At times like these, you must focus on "cultivation." Otherwise, if someone congratulates you and you respond with a gloomy face, asking where the joy comes from, wouldn't both parties be embarrassed and violate common courtesy?</p>
<p>In general, being able to do things according to one's own interests and will is a supreme pleasure. Conversely, the most painful thing is not being able to express one's suffering, putting on a brave face while feeling miserable, knowing something is wrong but having to pretend it isn't, knowing something is false but having to pretend it's true. Those who dare to laugh and scold, who can cry and fight, are straightforward people. If you can't laugh out loud or cry openly, and you depend on others' opinions and facial expressions, you're in the most miserable position in the world. If the coming year brings peace and prosperity to the nation, then when this annual holiday arrives, people will naturally offer heartfelt congratulations and blessings. The words will be sweet on their lips and in their hearts, and hearing auspicious words will surely enhance everyone's joy. Unfortunately, in these times of war and chaos, the cold faces of creditors on New Year's Eve are vaguely before our eyes, and the ominous rumors of future layoffs and salary cuts linger in our ears. Though the words we speak are invariably auspicious and peaceful, our hearts are like overturned five-flavored bottles, filled with an indescribable mixture of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, spiciness, and saltiness.</p>
<p>Perhaps auspicious words are one reason why people act so falsely towards each other. For example, if someone's father dies, death is death, and everyone has to die eventually. But people avoid the word "death." To the deceased's son, they say "passed away as an immortal" or "returned to heaven." Yet, who knows if they were secretly cursing the old man for not dying sooner? Pretense is bad morality, but if pretense becomes a habit, it also becomes a social norm. It seems that not pretending is a lack of social graces, while following the habit of pretense is considered good etiquette, making you a "superior person." I remember when teachers taught children to "know books and understand etiquette." On one hand, they told children to remember and follow moral character, honesty, simplicity, and sincerity. On the other hand, they taught them the habits of responding to elders, showing that although our country has always valued morality and promoted simplicity, ritualistic pretense, such as saying auspicious words, is not only permitted but also highly commendable. Tsze-yew, denounced by the English literary giant Johnson as a "dancing boy" and "prostitute," specialized in teaching young men to pretend and use auspicious words to beg for food. His philosophy was: since saying auspicious words gets you food, people should learn to say auspicious words.</p>
<p>There are many people in the world who make a living by saying auspicious words. The matchmakers at weddings in the past were the best representatives of this type of person, spouting sweet words and auspicious phrases, promising wealth and honor, and many descendants. The families involved had no choice but to give them lucky envelopes and a feast. Don't think that this is an easy job; in fact, it's very hard work. First, you must put your own emotions aside and banish your own thoughts. Then, when you see people laughing, you must also laugh loudly, even more joyfully than they do. When you see people crying, you must also shed a few tears, and even cry more sorrowfully than they do. With this skill, you can win the master's handouts, and you won't have to worry about food and clothing anywhere. To some, this may seem easy, but to those who are not good at observing faces and distinguishing emotions, it is by no means a simple task. Because if you are not careful, serving your master is like serving a tiger; you might not get the handout and instead get a beating!</p>
<p>I'm straying further and further from the topic, and my words are not only inauspicious but also seem a bit tiresome and annoying. I should stop quickly and say "Congratulations and be prosperous" to avoid being called a "crow"!</p>

<p>Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (73)</p>
<p>Little Wang's mother poured a cup of tea and handed it to Zhuzhai, who then asked: "When the boss left for the exam today, did he say anything?" Little Wang's mother saw the anxious expression on Zhuzhai's face and really wanted to tell him about Xu Yuru's visit to Qihuan today, and Qihuan's painful and chaotic situation. But she was afraid that if she said these words, it would only increase Zhuzhai's sadness, and she didn't understand what was going on, so she didn't dare to speak rashly. She only shook her head and said: "The boss didn't say anything before leaving." After Little Wang's mother said this, she sat down on a small stool and muttered, "Head," but she was just thinking, seeing this situation, I'm afraid something is going to happen. The boss's situation when he went out today was different from usual. It seems that this matter is related to that old man Xu, but since the boss has ordered me not to say anything, how can I tell Mr. Xu? While thinking, she looked at Zhuzhai, saw him sitting on the sofa, leaning back on the sofa back, his face pale, his eyes closed, shaking his head from time to time, and asked: "Mr. Xu, you said you fell on the road, does your body still hurt? Don't get hurt!" As she spoke, she stood up and walked to Zhuzhai. Zhuzhai opened his eyes, held his waist with one hand, and said: "I feel sore here." Little Wang's mother smiled and said: "Mr. Xu, do you remember? Last time you fell in the alley, you twisted your leg, and I massaged it for you. Otherwise, you take off your clothes and let me take a look, and a massage will be fine." Zhuzhai said: "I'm too lazy to move, it doesn't matter." Little Wang's mother saw that Zhuzhai didn't want to take off his clothes, and sat back on the chair, her eyes only looking at Zhuzhai. Zhuzhai closed his eyes, because Little Wang's mother had just said that he had fallen in the alley last time, which brought up the past. He thought that at that time, he and Qihuan were still in the trial stage, not like now, when they were painfully in love, and that time he wasn't hurt at all, it was all fake. This evening's fall was not light, but he couldn't care about it. As long as Qihuan can come back safely, even if I get hurt, I am willing. Zhuzhai thought for a while, and then opened his eyes, saw the clock on the wall, and saw Little Wang's mother sitting opposite him, her starry eyes still fixed on his face, and frowned and said: "The boss hasn't come back yet, it's really worrying!"</p>
<h3 id="e172">On [Gimmicks] and the Like <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Xuanxuan</p>
<p>Reynolds, the American ballpoint pen king, went to Nanjing, carrying a ballpoint pen of his own brand, and took pictures everywhere. Nanjing reporters ridiculed him for having too much of a "business atmosphere," and even said that his launching of an aerial expedition to measure the "world's highest peak" was just a "gimmick" to advertise his ballpoint pens.</p>
<p>Regarding such accusations, from the standpoint of a Chinese person and a modern person, we can only smile wryly and simply cannot speak.</p>
<p>Since the Jishi Mountain in Qinghai may be the "world's highest peak," why do we, as the masters of the land, let an American businessman sell this "gimmick"? Why did our merchants not see this and insist on letting others take the limelight? "Worrying about others' success for fear of being poor yourself" is probably the biggest shortcoming of us Chinese people, besides self-intoxication in our 阿Q spirit.</p>
<p>I have no intention of "increasing others' ambition." The intellectual stagnation of our old country is nearing the point of no return. Apart from making money, 99.9% of Chinese people no longer have any higher interests. An expedition launched by a successful American businessman only serves to highlight that other businessmen still have an interest in learning. It is we ourselves who have too much of a "business atmosphere," seeking nothing but money.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Reynolds is doing it for advertising or truly has an interest in exploration, at least others still understand how to "cultivate elegance." As for our merchants, or non-merchants who have made a fortune, they do not necessarily have that refinement. With gold and US dollars, or even just a few billion legal tender, they only want to go to the gambling halls and take concubines. Who still has a higher interest, such as exploration? The ancients ridiculed villagers, saying: when the bell tolls and the night ends, the white-haired old men, if they earn a few more bushels of wheat, will immediately take a concubine. It can be seen that the Chinese interest in taking concubines has been high since ancient times, and is now even more intense.</p>
<p>The old national vitality is lost. Now, we have become just a small pawn in the international chessboard of power politics. All we can boast about is "thousands of years of history," but this treasure trove of history must be developed by others, because we ourselves do not know that we have this treasure trove, or even if we know, we do not have the resources and interest to develop it. Today's Egypt, Iran, and India are similar. A country that only flaunts the word "ancient" is not something to be proud of.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Withdrawing Pre-War Deposits <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Mu</p>
<p>I went to the bank for a friend to withdraw pre-war deposits. I stood outside the iron fence, holding a stack of deposit slips in my hand. I waited patiently for the bank clerk to finish his private affairs. Finally, I handed in the deposit slips, waiting with a sense of loss to see him calculate the exchange rate of the deposits. I asked him with a shy face how much money there was. He told me that the total amount of 1,300 yuan, deposited separately five or six years ago, was now only worth 680,000 yuan. At the same time, he handed me a copper plate.</p>
<p>I turned to the "payment" window of this bank to withdraw money. Although this was not my own money, I seemed to be the most foolish person in the world under the gaze of the crowd. In their eyes, I seemed to be the only fool who didn't know how to buy goods and preserve the value of the currency, and watched the value of legal tender melt away like a piece of butter on a cake.</p>
<p>After a while, the cashier, after handling payments of 20 million, 30 million, 5 million, etc., called out the number on the copper plate I received, and gave me the "generous" sum of 690,000 yuan. I seemed to have concluded a long-pending case that had been unresolved for several years for my friend, and breathed a sigh of relief. But at the same time, I felt a heavy stone pressing on my chest, and I felt sorry for my friend.</p>
<p>Indeed, under this runaway inflation, many people's hard-earned savings have been left behind. According to the most basic interpretation of economics, money should have the functions of (1) a medium of exchange, (2) a measure of value, (3) a store of value, and (4) a standard of deferred payment... Currently, it seems that it can only be used for the first two purposes, while the latter two have long been abandoned. Naturally, we do not want to use a currency with incomplete functions. Currently, there are loud calls for currency reform, and one of the reasons may lie here.</p>

<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Gao Qipei painted with his fingers, calling himself "Finger Life." Since then, finger painting became popular in the painting world. In modern times, there are quite a few people who are good at finger painting, but no one has been heard of who paints with their toes. According to the history of painting, there are actually three people who can paint with their toes.</p>
<p>(1) Lu Ban: The Hundred Schools Book says: Gongshu Ban's water saw its reflection and said: See your shape. The leech then came out, and Ban drew a picture of it with his foot. See Customs and Meanings. Also, the Waterways Classic Commentary says: There used to be a portrait of Fuliushen. This god once spoke to Lu Ban, and Ban ordered him to come out. Fuliu said: My appearance is ferocious, and you are good at drawing objects. I cannot come out. Ban then bowed his hands and said to him: Come out and let me see you. Cunliu then came out. Ban then painted the ground with his feet. Cunliu felt it and immediately returned to the water, so the statue was placed in the water, only the back above stood on the water.</p>
<p>(2) Skillful Person: Emperor Qin Shi Huang sought to meet the Sea God. The god said: My appearance is ugly. If you can sketch my shape, I will meet with the Emperor. Emperor Shi Huang went into the sea for thirty li and met the god. There was a skillful person on his left and right who secretly drew the shape of the god with his feet. —Three Qi Brief Records.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Heng: There is a beast named Haishen in the mountains of Pucheng County, Jianzhou. It has the body of a pig and the head of a human, and likes to come out on the rocks by the water. Pingzi (Zhang Heng) went to write about it. The beast entered the pool and did not come out. Someone said: This beast is afraid of people painting it, so it doesn't come out. You can remove the paper and pen. The beast did indeed come out. Pingzi bowed his hands and did not move. He secretly drew the beast with his toes. —Guo's Records of Strange Things.</p>
<p>Gongshu Ban and Lu Ban are commonly regarded as the same person. Lu Guo, a skilled craftsman from the Spring and Autumn Period, is referred to as Gongshu Pan in Mozi, Gongzhezi Lu Ban in Mengzi's commentary, and Gongshu Ban in Historical Records Annotation, Later Han Book Annotation, and Literary Selections Annotation. However, Morning and Evening Records says: "Lu Ban was a native of Dunhuang, Suzhou. His era is unknown. He possessed skills like creation. He once made a wooden kite, rode it, and flew. Gongzhe Ban of the Six Kingdoms also made a large kite to spy on Song City." It seems that they were two people. In fact, the words of Morning and Evening Records are not credible. It is more reliable to take the words of Mozi and Mengzi as one person.</p>
<p>Looking at the above four stories, although the names of people, gods, places, and times are different, their contents are by no means consistent. Using one's toes to paint the god in the water, and the god is ugly and afraid of being painted. Probably, there was such a legend in ancient times. As time went on, there were inevitably different versions of the story. At first glance, it seems to be three things, but in fact it is an evolution of one story. Which of the three people can actually paint with their toes? Of course, it is impossible to verify now, but due to the spread of this kind of story, it is sufficient to show the possibility of foot painting. Before the war, there was a "Universal Foot" in Shanghai. He was born without hands, and his two feet could perform all kinds of skills. He often performed publicly, but now I don't know where he went. It is a pity that I have never seen him paint. Huang Ernan of Beiping can paint with his tongue, which is even stranger in the painting world.</p>

<p>— Tongtuo</p>
<p>Today, people all over the world are suffering from the heavy pressure of high prices, suffocating to the point of not being able to breathe. But on a small island in the northern Caribbean Sea, one US dollar can provide five times the material and comfort, driving countless Americans crazy. This is the third small island south of the United States, the Republic of Haiti, known to the world. The island of Haiti is full of romance, bright colors, and pleasant scenery.</p>
<p>It takes four hours to reach the capital, Port-au-Prince, by seaplane from Miami. The scenery anywhere else in the world cannot compare to this place. Stretching from the lush forested hills to the beach is this vibrant white city, shining in the sun. The dockworkers are carrying things, barefoot, showing off their muscles, shouting noisily. Some light-skinned mulattos, the wealthy aristocrats of Haiti, wearing the latest American fashions, pass by in luxurious cars in a flash. The roads are wide and flat, the buildings are new, and occasionally there are dirty streetcars and dilapidated thatched huts - these are the unforgettable capital sights of the Republic of Haiti.</p>
<p>Here, five hundred US dollars a year can make you live very comfortably.</p>
<p>There are clubs everywhere, golf and tennis courts, gorgeous salons and dining rooms, and two cinemas and a racetrack. The cuisine in the hotels, clubs, and dining rooms is all French. On the slowly rising slopes in the city, all the way to the top of the mountain, are the mansions of the Haitian elite.</p>
<p>The mansions of the elite are extremely beautiful, with pavilions, terraces, and gardens, lush lawns, and various exotic flowers and plants. You can have fresh flowers every day, all year round. These ultra-modern houses rent for about 40 to 150 dollars per month. The reason for the low prices is the original economic structure of Haiti - wealthy nobles and poor tenant farmers.</p>
<p>The prominent people in Haiti are generally not dark-skinned, have received higher education, and are highly cultured. According to a standard work, The Haitian People by James Leyburn, the local wealthy families trace their lineage back to French aristocracy. The wealthy families are in all strata of society, especially government officials, military leaders, or heads of major industries. They study in France and are intellectually equal to any upper class people in the world. Leyburn's book also mentions that there has never been a dispute between the nobles and the tenant farmers.</p>
<p>Ordinary Haitians are mostly farmers, with a small piece of land, exchanging sweat and blood for harvests of grains, beans, cotton, coffee, and tobacco. They are illiterate, let alone write.</p>
<p>The annual income of a farmer is almost equal to only one dollar and fifty cents in US dollars. Someone who has lived in Haiti for many years said: A villager accidentally had a fire, and the whole family was burned to ashes. But it only cost one dollar and twenty-five cents to restore it to its original state. The building materials were taken from the mud and thatch by the river. It took six days of labor, at fifteen cents a day, totaling ninety cents, and the remaining thirty-five cents was used to purchase furniture and other items.</p>
<p>People traveling to Haiti can rent a villa on the mountainside, with a swimming pool and tennis court and other facilities, which costs only as much as an ordinary apartment room in the United States. If they hire cooks, maids, male servants, laundresses, gardeners, drivers, etc. in the villa, the total wage cost is only fifty dollars per month.</p>
<p>The best beef is two cents a pound; a chicken is thirty cents; the world's best coffee is twelve cents a pound, and sugar is sixty cents a pound. Even a week-long grand banquet will not cost more than seventy-five dollars a month.</p>
<p>What Americans are worried about is that tourists are coming in droves, all wanting to find houses, which will inevitably cause prices to skyrocket. Haiti has remained virtually unchanged for a hundred years. As long as the country can maintain the status quo, it can truly be a paradise for recluses.</p>
<h3 id="e176">My Hometown Yixing <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>When mentioning one's hometown, it is common to use "My". When using the word "My", no matter what the matter, there is usually some humility and some boasting. This can also be said to be a habit of the Chinese people, especially intellectuals. As long as the "humility" has roots and the "boasting" has evidence, it is okay to talk about it.</p>
<p>My hometown, Yixing, formerly known as Yangxian, is a small county on the southern coast of Jiangsu Province. It is neither located in a political hub like Jinling, where dragons coil and tigers crouch, nor in an economic center like Shenpu, a city of tens of thousands of foreign countries. Even compared to the prosperous cities of Suzhou and Yangzhou, it is far behind. Even the "no constancy once arrived" in the same prefecture, the so-called "Little Shanghai" and "Little Suzhou", my Yixing bows down to them. This is something that cannot but be suppressed and conceded.</p>
<p>However, there is the elegance of Su Shi, who bought fields to spend his old age there, and the unusual feats of General Zhou, who shot tigers and killed dragons. The Shanshan Zhanggong Caves are magnificent, and the Fuxi River is clear and shallow, so why envy the landscape of Guilin? Located at the crossroads of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, with the two paradises of Suzhou and Hangzhou on its left and right, it is called a famous and scenic spot. Who would say it is not suitable? As for the products, the purple clay pottery is exquisite in workmanship and materials, elegant and unparalleled. Compared with the famous porcelain of Ganzhou Jingzhen, each has its own strengths. It is not only famous in China, but also occupies a dominant position in foreign sales. It has long been a well-known product. These are all worth boasting about, and they are indeed not false.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi were still able to maintain considerable order, but my Yixing was repeatedly shelled, making significant sacrifices for the country. In 1938, my friend Xu Zhiying (a native of Yixing, a famous journalist) told me that the area around Weiqiao had been reduced to ruins, and he wept for it. Recently, I received a letter from Banmeng Weng (a clan elder and famous calligrapher and painter) showing his work on returning to Yixing after the war, which made me even more nostalgic. The poem says: (1) I wandered around the old site, the broken house did not need to be opened (Original note: I went to the wine shop with a friend, and most of the houses in my hometown did not have doors), the cattle days are exhausted, the new market, it is difficult to restore the old buildings in ten years. The small mountain village has remnant tiles, tea bowls and poems depicting the ash of the calamity. Fortunately, I have an old friend to shake hands with, pouring sorrow in the wine shop and on the street. (2) I endure tears to find the old traces in the wind, and walk slowly with long skills and depression. Life should be indulged in wine, where can I live happily in the troubled world! The scenic spots are no longer intact (Original note: the scenic spots outside the city are all destroyed), and half of the old friends are the remaining ashes of the calamity. If I can barely settle down, if I encounter war again, I am afraid that I will be a ruin again (Original note: the banditry is very tight now)! Yu Jingzhai and Banmeng wrote a poem after returning to their hometown after the calamity: "The clear spring is leisurely, the bamboo is twilight and yellow, and the road enters the flat embankment to know the old corridor (Original note: Yuefei's garrison, outside the south city of Yangxian), the red leaves are affectionate and long, and the green hills are intact and half lost (Original note: Yue Pavilion, Sishui Nunnery, and Red Leaf Corridor on the embankment are all destroyed in the war, and the Red Leaf Corridor plaque was written by Banmeng); ten years of war have left traces of old things, and I wander along the road to find the ancient wilderness, lamenting that there are few famous scholars passing the river, so I don't need to go to the drunk "Xiaochang" (wine name)." Reciting the works of two friends, not only the city was destroyed, but also the scenic spots and famous areas, and the people of the township were also wiped out. The suffering of the Japanese pirates in my Yixing was particularly cruel. I sigh that the bomb hit Nagasaki, that the way of heaven is good for repayment, and the retribution is not bad. Comparing the two, it is quite gratifying.</p>
<p>Yixing has had prosperous humanities throughout the ages, and there is no end to enumerating them in the distant past. Even from the former Qing Dynasty to the present, the Chu family, with their classics, history, and ancient texts, were heavily named in the early Qing Dynasty. There were also many virtuous and good selections among the officials, which was most prosperous during the Kangxi period. Yesterday, I bought a list of Jinshi from the 27th year of Qianlong in the factory city. The first person listed was the Vice Minister of the Clan Mansion, Mr. Chu Meifu of Jingxi (Linzhi, Jinshi of the Jihai year). From Qianlong to Tongguang, there were famous people in every generation. Since the Republic of China, my brother (Nanqiang) has become famous for his political and legal affairs, and is worthy of being the strong man in the South; Wang Kun is a legal expert and a giant in the press, and it is believed that the Chu family is talented. Zhunong once served as the magistrate of Nantong County. After political affairs, he sent his feelings to Fengya, and his other name was "Flower". His family had "Painting Mountain Tower", which was based on the poem "The clear weather in the corner of the house fills the painting mountain", and there was a small building in the west of the city, with Banmeng as the topic "Listening to Water and Listening to Wind Tower". He also wrote a small poem in the middle of the day: "The willow wind rolls the green waves of the stream at night, holding the Qin and the moon is bright, worrying about the cold king, a pair of white seagulls suspect that they are entering the window, sitting and composing the Narcissus music with the curtain." The real situation is like this, I want to see the beauty in it. In the eight years of Japanese chaos, I don't know if this building was spared?</p>
<p>There are many large families, and talents in political and academic circles are emerging in large numbers. Banmeng is Yunshi, and his rank is the most respected. His calligraphy studies Wang Menglou, and he modestly said that his skills are good, so he is called "Banmeng". In the Jiyou year, he was selected as a tribute, and served as a judge for more than ten years. Now he is nearly seventy years old, and he is a resident of Shanghai. Zhiying has been in the northern press for a long time, and Zhucheng has been in the Tianjin Dagong Newspaper, with remarkable achievements. Recently, I received a letter from Yunshi Weng, knowing that he is in Shanghai, waiting for the time to come. I have also heard that there are many outstanding people from Yixing in the Shanghai industry, but the old man is not alone, and he is stuck in the ancient city, unable to meet all the emerging heroes. Twenty years ago, Chunming's old friends, or Ping has "Southern people return to the South", or have died one after another. Only in the newspaper and in the letters of one or two relatives and friends, I learned that my brother Sha Wuzeng (Renxiao Lian, a judicial and legislative writer) is a mainstay of the political party, working hard for the country. At the age of nearly seventy, he is old and strong; my brother Jia Guobo is in the financial world, serving as an official for forty years, and he has a number of characters with experience and learning. The two brothers often travel back and forth to Beijing and Shanghai, and I can imagine their public actions; my brother Yu Jingzhai has entered the economic world from the legal world, and he is also able to handle it with ease, believing that talented people can do everything. Borrowing this extra space, I am familiar with my old friends. An old and desolate man, I don't know when I will see you again, I laugh at myself.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Legal Consultation and Clarification for Readers: Amidst Housing Shortage, Ordinary People Suffer, Second Landlords Run Rampant, Refusing to Accept Rent <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Liu Jiasun Asks: (1) My late father rented a house in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) for a monthly rent of five yuan, paid in advance. No contract was signed at the time. Starting in May of this year, (1) the landlord suddenly refused to accept the rent, claiming that he wanted to take it back for his own use. Is this legal? (2) The second landlord wants to sign a fixed-term relocation contract with me, as well as a contract to exchange houses (from good to bad). Can I refuse? (3) The second landlord refuses to accept the rent. What standard should I use to deposit it with the court, and how should water and electricity costs be calculated? (4) What are the procedures for depositing with the court? Besides the court, where else can I deposit the rent? (5) My family makes a living by washing clothes. If the second landlord refuses to supply tap water, how should we cope? (6) Tap water and electricity all belong to the second landlord. If the second landlord stops supplying electricity, how should we deal with it?</p>
<p>[Legal Advisor Mr. Ming Shi Answers] (1) Taking back for one's own use is permitted by the Land Law, but the lessor must prove the circumstances under which he should take it back (refer to Article 100 of the Land Law). (2) Of course, you cannot be forced to sign. (3) You can deposit the original rent amount. However, if you believe that the original rent amount is indeed unreasonable, you can deposit it according to the 1,400 times the amount negotiated by the city government. Water and electricity costs should also be handled according to the original regulations, or the ratio of the number of rooms, or the amount of consumption. Deposits should be made monthly thereafter. (4) The court has a deposit office with pre-printed forms. Fill them out item by item and submit them. Banks can also be used for deposits, but the lessor's account name must be established at the time of deposit. After the deposit, a written notice must be given. However, its evidentiary power is not as strong as a court deposit. (5) Drinking water is indispensable for human life. In an emergency, you can complain to the nearest police station to force the supply. Electricity is slightly different, and it is even more different when water and electricity are used for professional purposes. In addition to applying to the water and electricity company for installation yourself, you should first confirm the provisions of the lease.</p>
