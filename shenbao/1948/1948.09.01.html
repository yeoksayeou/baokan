<h3>中紡股票月中發行　七成充金圓券保証準備　十分之三委託國行代售　票面一百圓分有記名無記名兩種</h3>
<p>〔報本南京卅一日電〕政府爲充實發行準備及充裕國庫收入起見，決定將國營事業變爲有價證券，發行股票，除一部撥充發行準備，以一部正式出售，關於發行股票這準備事宜，各國營事業有關機關現正開始着手分別準備。關於中紡公司之發行股票辦法，工商部長陳啓天於卅一日下午召集商業司長鄧翰良，管制司長費明揚及有關各司長商討結果，卅一日晚已將全部辦法決定，依該辦法之決定，中紡公司變更登記後，將變爲有價證券發行股票六百萬股，每股爲一百金圓，現積極積極準備，希望於十日至十五日五日內開始發行，除撥充十分之七爲發行金圓券保證準備，將股票移送發行監理委員會外，其餘十分之三，將公開在市塲出售，其出售方式，委託各國家銀行代爲辦理，股票分有記名與無記各兩種，人民購證時，可不加限制，並將採足額發行，股票面額雖爲一百金元，但出售之價格將在一百金元以上，因中紡公司過去估價時，僅將機器房地產估計在內，尙有製成品及材料等多未計入，當時估計中紡公司之資產爲一億四千五百餘萬美元，較之實際價値，已相差甚遠，故出售時較原估價者爲高，人民仍必樂於購買，此項股票，約於十五日後可以上市，惟不必證交恢復營業，即可由各國家銀行出售，其他各國營事業之發行股票辦法，亦正由該主管機關擬訂中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕財經緊急處分令公布施行以來，初步成就已見諸專實，某熟悉政情之權威人士，三十一日對記者談稱二經濟之改革，必須厲行緊縮節約，在財經緊急處分令公布，政府曾陸續公布各項法令，對於增闢稅源及管制物價，均有具體而詳盡之步驟，此不僅在表現其對經濟改革之決心，同時亦表現政府辦　之效能，乃此次改革之成功之基本條件，値得吾人之讚揚。惟其中亦不免於疏漏者，即對緊縮節約方面，尙嫌不足，原緊急處分令中，對國營事業機關之節省浪費及對文武職機關人員之薪資之規定等等，意義重要，對此次經濟改革之成敗，其影響並不在增加稅源管制物價下，但政府對以上各種辦法尚未有具體詳盡之規定，頗使人懷疑，吾人試觀英人以消極辦法度其經濟難關，不應有所忽視，現文武機關人員之名額與每月國庫負担養人經費之浩大，即可知緊縮辦法已刻不容緩。某權威人士旋續就緊縮辦法發表意見稱；整頓國營事業，首應裁汰冗員，雖然裁員在事實上有若干困難，但政府必須具有決心，且必須將救濟失業與國家用人分爲兩事，則裁負自可成功，除此之外，節約各項物資，尤爲當務之急，吾人仍應循抗戰時期之節約辦法，以爲今日鑒，則財經緊急處分令目可圓滿達成矣。</p>

<h3>對七五事件願負全責　傅作義自請懲處　電長二千餘言情詞懇切</h3>
<p>〔本報北平卅一日電〕傅作義因七五事件責任問題，卅日電呈一蔣總統翁院長自請處分消息已刊昨日本報第一版，原電長二千餘言，略稱：頃讀監院調査報吿書，究明事件，應受懲處人員，其中獨無作義，爲求充份證明政府對靑年學生之始終愛護，謹依「罰自上先」之名訓，所有事件責任，職願完全担負，乞嚴予懲處，以平事端。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平卅一日電〕傅作義電呈蔣總統翁院長，陳述處理「七五」事件意見，並列舉下述四項理由，自請處分：</p>
<p>同情學生</p>
<p>（一）東北靑年由於遭遇特苦，此次歷經險阻，輾轉來平，論情論理，均應獲得政府之深切關懷，及社會之最大同情，然以戰亂影響，物質艱困，雖經多方努力，迄未能予以適時適切之安置。七五事件之發生，不論學生行動如何越軌，然學生死者八人，傷者十九人，商民死者一人，究爲無可否認之事實。職於悲痛之餘，甘願身受其責，以一已之犧牲，表明政府愛護靑年之至意，使死者瞑目九泉，生者稍獲安慰，而靑年學生，經此慘痛教訓，當知陰謀播弄渚在同情鼓動之口號下，實已包藏奸險狠毒之目</p>
<p>借刀殺人，識破陰謀者之詭</p>
<p>倆，提高警覺，是犧牲作義一人，可喚回無數靑年忠於國家，忠於政府之熱　。</p>
<p>尊崇參會</p>
<p>（二）當茲民主憲政實施之初，參議會爲合法民意機關，領導人民，贊襄政府，地位固極崇高，責任尤爲重大，凡屬國民，均應尊崇其權責，有所決議，政府視實際情况，或負責招待，或當備參考。此次來市參議會所于安置東北來平學生決議案，不論其措詞有無不當實際，且未送達政府，不意竟遭暴力搗毀，此不獨對民主憲政爲一重大之損害，且創全國議會失去今法保障之惡例，職維護憲政心切，恨未能事先防範，揆之責任，衡之事實，自身實有失職責。</p>
<p>愛護警憲</p>
<p>（三）七五學生遊行，警憲奉命維持秩序，職曾嚴令，凡接近學生均一律徒手，各級警憲官長，亦一再申戒，不許流血，更無任何人下達開槍命令；警憲人員自晨至暮，始終以打不還手，駡不還口，在十一小時之長時間中，忍飢忍渴，維護公共治安，雖學生行動激越，幸未發生任何意外；諜料於下午七時宣布戒嚴後，學生與軍警不幸發生衝突，依據當時情况，第一槍究從何方而來，雙方各執一詞，在學生固爲即將起身散去，在軍警則以學生起身與槍聲同時發作，誤認爲學生開始奪槍，緊急驚懼之下，乃不幸而造成此流血事件，維持秩序之員警受傷者亦達廿餘人。地方治安機關負有保護人民生命財產莊嚴責任，宣佈戒嚴後，尤有維持治安鎭壓暴動之職權，警憲人員忍饑忍渴，受盡譏駡之餘，繼之以流血負傷，不能不謂爲忍辱持重，其狀堪　，其情可憫—七五事件責任固不能加題彼等之身，秩序要求彼等維持，而責任亦諉之彼等担負，懲罰不及上官，而僅責之部下，則今後維持治安者恐將無人矣，其影響於社會人羣生命財產者，將至不堪設想。爲打破已往官塲中功自居過諉人之陋習，且免中奸匪解除城市警憲武裝之圈套，職甘願担負事件責任。</p>
<p>正義旁礴</p>
<p>（四）七五事不幸發生後，東北父老因關　子弟情殷，言論或不免有所激憤，各方人士對善後處理，亦多予以重大注意，其動機純眞，深可感佩；蓋東北靑年即中華民國之靑年，來平後取爲北平之靑年，愛護關切，人同此心，豈僅東北父老爲然？而東北人士，官九一八以來，歷盡流浪之苦，不無冷落之感，勝利後以失士未復，不得重返家園，情緒抑鬱，極易激動。然此乃正養旁礴之呼喊，實應予以保愛與鼓勵，以期發而爲剿匪救民之忠勇行動。作義珍視此種可貴少情緒，甘願承受事件之全部懲罰。</p>
<p>願受嚴懲</p>
<p>電文末稱「此次事件，旣不能以法律觀點按照戒嚴法不予處分，而須以感情觀點懲罰」入藉平事端。今政府不加職以罪責，一切怨懟，統由他人承受，則政府一貫保愛學生之方針，尤其鈞座一人愛護靑年之德意，或將受人誤解矣。」又稱：「鈞座旣已授職以華北全權，職自當負責事件全部責任，論理至平，論情至當，即如七九學生遊行，雖高呼「槍斃傅作義」口號，職心平如水，毫未介意，蓋事件造成之情節，雖極複雜，然不幸旣已造成，職自當承受此不幸之結果，並以極其愉快之心情，接受鈞座最嚴厲之處分。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>記者節略論報業</h3>
<p>今天是我們報人自己的節日，一年一度，緬懷過去，正視現實，瞻望將來，實在是我們報人自我檢討的最好機會。今天度此佳節，我們除了加强「中國要進步，我們新聞界先得要進步」的信念而外，尙須自省自勵，刻苦努力，以盡我們報人對於國家社會的責任。</p>
<p>我國報業的發展，也可和其他事業一樣，以抗戰爲分水嶺，劃分爲三個階段。從民國以來至抗戰前夕，是我國報業的第一階段。報業想走的是英美路綫，全國報人無不憧憬着英美式的自由主義的理想，認報業爲自由職業的一門，對言論力爭自由，對新聞力求迅速。但在本質上，其時我國報業仍與英美報業不同，就是英美各國的報紙，無一不作大規模之經營，而我國報紙雖也有商業化的趨向，但仍爲文人論政的私人機關，除了上海一二大報而外，各地報紙無不以言論爲爭取讀者的手段。惟至九一八以後，國步日艱，我國報業始有根本的轉變，不論是民間報紙也好，或黨營報紙也好，都有着一個共同的意向，各報的言論有時雖不免有相異之點，但對於「民族至上國家至上」的信念，卻有共同一致的認識，任何議論的目的，總是求國難的排除與民族的自由生存。所以在抗戰之前，我國報業對於國內和平統一的完成，就有非常重大的貢獻。</p>
<p>我國報業隨着抗戰爆發而步入第二階段，在八一三滬戰爆發之後，全國報紙無不挺身而出，將自己的一張報紙，完全貢獻給國家，聽其使用，於是由文人論政的機關，一變而爲宣揚國策的利器。同時，全國報人也有了更進一步的認識，咸以爲報業與國家的命運不可分離，離開了國家就不能生存：就是過去力爭言論自由的報紙，也變爲相當接受政府指　的公共宣傳機關，不僅衷心歡迎政府檢査新聞，而且不論在言論或新聞方面，也無不恪守戰時新聞政策，嚴格奉行抗戰建國綱領。所以在抗戰八年期間，我們報人對於抗戰勝利確有無上的貢獻，不僅深得國人的信賴與尊重，而且也獲得國際上的榮譽·今日思之，猶引爲我們報人無上的光榮。</p>
<p>但至抗戰勝利之後，我國報業不特未能發育滋長，百尺竿頭，再進一步，反而面臨兩大危機，使報業趨於黯淡無色。第一是外來的危機。因爲國內戰亂未已，遍地烽火，以致社會不安，民生凋敝，交通阻塞，事業停滯，我國報業乃首受重大打擊，最近各報銷路之少，流行之窄，簡直是近十五年來所少見。甚至有若干報紙，因爲物質條件的貧困，無力維持而不得不自動停刋了。報業旣不景氣，首當其衝的，當然是我們報人。因爲待遇的菲薄，不僅不能安心工作，業餘進修，而且大多數的報人或且在失業與飢餓綫上掙扎·漢口同業要求以公教待遇支薪，可見他們對公教人員還懷着羨慕之忱，魷是一個絕好的例子·第二是內在的危機。因爲我們報人，受了國際潮流的激盪，固無不醉心於「新聞自由」，而同時又往往忽略了「新聞的責任」，因此，在新聞的記載或言論的表現方面，但求私意之痛快，不顧公衆之利害，於是言論記載，不免越出常規，甚至有的記者隨心所欲，竟拋棄國家民族的立塲於不顧。三年以來，報界的糾紛層出不窮，固或由於種種不可意料的原因，而我們一部分報人稍稱缺乏新聞責任感，也未始不是內在危機之所在。瞻望將來，我們報人對於報紙的責任，若仍不能有所警惕，則今後我國報界或恐還不能完全負起推動社會改造，策進國家建設的重大使命，</p>
<p>要之，我國報業所面臨的兩重危機，不僅足以阻碍我國報業的發展，而且也是建國途中的一塊絆脚石，實在不容全國朝野的忽視。我們除了希望政府設法挽救全國報業的危機而外，更盼望我們仝業更能自勉自强，力求報業的進步。但是要報業進步，新聞教育先得要進步。所以我們在今天慶祝記者節，深願教育當局特別注意到記者人才的栽培知現任記者的進修與研究，而對於上海十餘記者今天發起籌設「上海新聞館」之舉，先表示無條件的贊助。</p>

<p>社會黨今晚發表公報，指斥萊諾所建議之經濟計劃，旣不能救治財政之危急，又不能滿足工人與社會之安定，因之必然引起閣潮。最後社會黨之公報對近日報紙發動反社會黨運動頗感不滿，指其應負政府不穩定之責任。</p>
<p>（合衆社巴黎三十日電〕許曼今晚宣稱，渠將組織中閒路綫之內閣。許受與溫和派領袖等討論政策時，共黨發動工人遊行示威，主張舉行大選。按共黨於一九四六年大選時，獲票獨多，頗爲國內保守派人士所注意。戴高樂今亦贊成大選，希望由此控制議會。許受自出總統府後，吿記者稱，「余信時機危迫，人民已經不能等待。今日余與各黨領袖磋商之後，覺得我尙有獲得多數票之可能。組　事固艱巨，但余信必可成功」。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社雅典三十日電〕希臘陸軍參謀部發言人評論美駐希軍事委員團主任弗萊特在記者招待會中，詆責格拉摩斯山區希臘戰地數指揮縱容游擊隊五千餘人逃入阿爾巴尼亞境一帶謂，此一招待會乃屬機密性質，弗萊特之言諸多誤會。惟據希臘晨報載稱，弗萊特所涉及之各軍官業經撤職。</p>

<h3>承造房屋　得款潛逃　七保人連環推托　地檢處提起公訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院物資供應局前在復興島招標承造鉛皮屋面工程，結果爲一營造商沈士淸以最低價標得。當時即依約由沈覺得保證人余志盛，李林昌，陳鼎良三人保證，經物資供應局對保無訛，遂先付沈工款總額之半數法幣一百八十七億元。詎沈得款後，竟逃逸無蹤。供慼局以該屋遲遲不開工，遂向三保人處追究，但二保人亦均避匿他處，且先後延請律師登報聲明推盤及退保。該局以沈等實有通同詐騙工款嫌疑，乃即具狀地檢處控吿。余志盛避不到庭，陳鼎良供稱，係受李林昌所託，李則供係賣友人東志雲交情，而束又辦稱根本不認識沈士淸，僅係受張　民之轉託，張達民又供稱係同宗張錦芳所託。旋庭上擬傳訊張錦芳，不料又已潛逃。承辦檢察官以被吿等互相推託，實爲一邱之貉，乃一併依詐欺罪對七被吿提起公訴，在逃者均通緝歸案訊辦。</p>

<h3>從新角度勘察　煤都焦作　交通的窒息狀態即制了煤的產量</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報焦作廿四日航訊〕焦作，這中原的一座煤都，在戰火的籠罩下，它消失了過去的光彩。開對沒有煤，柴草賣到五萬元一斤，算起來一噸柴就是一億，新鄉的大炭要兩偉一唱，可是在中報公司新鄕辦事處聽李他齋專員說：焦作的大炭才一千八百萬一順，還是最近調整的，沒調整以前，碎煤每噸一百二十萬，够買一包香烟，焦作隱藏在雲霧問，記者決心去看一看。</p>
<p>記者抵焦作，入口處檢査森嚴，街道上找不出一家開張的店舖，小攤販很多，後來才聽說其中有很多都是礦上員工的一副業」。在河南境內已成稀有品的電燈在焦作市區間照耀着，然而它驅除不了籠畢在焦作周圍的濃雲慘霧。</p>
<p>中福公司</p>
<p>原有兩個礦區，一在李河，已在抗戰初期被破壞了，現在開採的是包括王封李封兩井的礦區，礦區的總面積約五千公噸，儲煤量據一般估計約爲二十七億五千四百萬噸。自民國二年至廿年計出煤二二八四一一六一噸，爲全國煤礦產煤量第三位。</p>
<p>焦作礦區（指李封王封下同）的地質屬石炭紀，礦區起初原屬山地，地殼變遷的結果使焦作礦區陷落，至今李封以北尙有斷層的痕跡可尋。礦區的地質結構大致是上面是石炭二疊紀，（包括太原系及山西系，即下二疊紀與中二疊紀。）下面是奧陶紀石灰岩，兩層之間，就是主要的煤層，其平均厚度在五·七八公尺左右。煤層的走向爲東北—西南，作十度至二十五度的傾斜。以王封爲中心，東北走約一千六百英尺，西南走約五千英尺。</p>
<p>煤質方面爲最優良的無烟煤，焦作的「玉河大炭」早已馳名國內。十七年前，我國參加萬國燃料會議的沈宜甲君，在比京Halconomi公司丙，曾以焦作煤和該公司所搜集的全世界煤樣一千多種加以比較，據他和該公司負賣人的判斷，焦作煤的煤質，遠超過英國的最優良的無烟煤，而其色澤光彩，直與石炭Graphitc無異。</p>
<p>記渚於抵焦作之次日，即由李發宗廠長陪同赴義區參觀。</p>
<p>李封王封</p>
<p>兩個大井的工程和設備者差不多，記者於在李封稍事劉覽之後，即赴礦廠所在地的王封作詳細的觀察。</p>
<p>玉封有一座三五〇K.W.的發電機，這與在焦作的一座七五〇K.W.發電機是焦作煤礦動力的源泉，這兩架機器每週替次地發動，休息的時間也就是修理的時間，因爲它們遷是一九二年的出品，太老了！王封電廠的上部，用鐵板權充天花板，這是戰時配備，爲了防砲彈。</p>
<p>王封有兩個井口，目前因爲產量少，只使用一個，煤車的升降以捲揚機操縱，由一個一百六十匹馬力和一個三十匹馬力的電動機發動，通風方面有汽力通風機担任輸送空氣入井的工作，井中排水設備則有電泵，由四百匹馬力的電動機發動。（待續）</p>

<h3>杭州秋訊</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>多玩幾大，金圓券剛剛發行，物價尙稱穩定，一般人落得在勝利後第一次穩定的物價中耍一要有名的西子湖。</p>
<p>商市動態</p>
<p>提起金圓券，杭州獲得消息以後的四五天，有些投機商人，很想蠢動一下，米糧，蔬菜，猪肉，紗布都曾沒有根據「八，一九一的折價而劇烈的上漲過，後來杭市輿論界人士一致呼籲，政府出動了大批警察，不法奸商，一一予以逮捕。自此，百貨都直綫下降至八月十九日原價。本來物價上漲的因素，除了物資不足，通貨膨脹以</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿九日訊〕幾朝秋雨把莫干山牯嶺的避暑客人陸續趕下山來，杭州又呈現出她的黃金時代。三個月沒有發現的成羣結隊遊客，重又蒞臨到西子湖濱。老於經騐的杭州人士說：今年「秋老虎」時間短，秋汎可延長，海寗潮特別大，去觀潮的來回，儘可以在杭州外，還有社會的因素，尤其在中國官商不分的情形下，投機商人，有恃無恐，拚命的抬高物價，官廳如果徇情濟私，便養成他們驕續大胆，官廳如秉公辦理，他們自也知所歛跡了。</p>
<p>為誰緩頰</p>
<p>杭州捕獲的這一批投機商人，據說還有人替他們緩頰，市商會爲了此事，特地招待新聞記者一次，他們的理由是：（一）貨物種類繁多，除日用必需品外，向無議價，因進貨成本不同，售價或有參差。（二）各業間有在八月十九日前公會議定調整價，而在十九日以後通知同業渚似朱便作搜自提高售價論。（三十九日後，因產地進價漲或有其他特殊原因，必須調整價目時，似應由公會按照成本，酌予調整。（四）由商會通知各業限八月卅一日前，一律按照八月十九日法幣價折合金圓標價出售。（五）政府管制物價法令，自慼遵守，惟商人智識水準較低，其初步實施，應由宣導令入手，若不問情節輕重，一律由特種刑庭伕辦，則商民人人自危，無法經營，欲求穩定物價，而使商市發生恐慌現象者，當非政府安定金融之本意，應由政府予以行政處分，以示體　。</p>
<p>杭州所逮捕的投機商人，除由商業公會理事長蔣光寅，解送特刑庭外，其餘都經有力份子保出。杭州的興諭界正不勝其杞憂，他們誠恐像這樣雷厲風行良好的現象能够維特幾久？被逮捕的人是不是一定可以繩之以法？</p>
<p>救濟特捐</p>
<p>杭州的救濟特捐也該在秋季結束了。總算皆大歡喜，沒有攤到豪門身上，而足由各個同業公會認捐了。聽說還有一百億左右沒有着落，某有力委員曾經說過：「你們都不捐好了，我反正頂多捐出五億。」但據熟悉內幕者說：「他連五億都沒有捐呢？」</p>
<p>這幾天來，在中正街一帶的店舖，有很多自動地掛出了「擁護蔣總統恢復八一九原價大减價再打九折」的招子。一般公教人員，莫不喜形於色，都去買了一些東西，他們都在嘴邊上說，這次政府施用威力的得計，看來內心是異常的愉快的。商人中有這樣善良的商人，是値得歌頌的。</p>
<p>望學興嘆</p>
<p>秋季了，杭州的各報學校也要開學了，每個學校都擠滿着報名的人，一個比校有名的小學，他一年級只招生十名，竟有一百廿九人去投考。市立中學僅招生百名，竟有兩于人投考。大學更不用說了。有兩個私立學校的收費是特副貴的，到這學校去讀幼稚園，要兩担五斗米一個學期的學費，市教育當局也見了他們頭痛，但他們說　因爲設備教師等關係，不得不如此　在這樣情形下，我們可以想到有多少人望着黌門而興嘆，有多少人失却求取智識的自由。</p>
<p>不過，杭州的黃金時代似乎並未失却，你看那湖濱划子抖擻着精神來歡迎顧客。各家賣土產的商店又在努力地粉刷門面，名勝區的小販們都在笑逐顏開來迎取今年的盛大秋汎。</p>
<p>滿覺隴又將桂子飄香了，在滿覺隴附近的虎跑，石屋洞，烟霞洞，又將湧出人山人海的浪潮，杭州眞是個「耍子」的地方嗎？他其實還有很多人生活在這個環境裏，他們像其他各地一樣，在想如使自己的生活過得好些。</p>

<h3>捲烟批發及零售價格　社會局昨已訂定　烟廠不得藉幫執貨不派</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕改革幣制實施經濟緊急措施以來，本市各大小捲烟廠因限價與增稅問題未獲解決，停止派貨，造成捲烟市塲供求不均現象。關於限價問題，昨日已經社會局核定，凡八月十九日無廠盤者，得參照一八一九」市塲價格，另訂新廠盤，惟不得超過該日市價。</p>
<p>社會局曾召集捲烟業商業同業公會，工業同業公會負責人談話。據該兩公會申述捲烟業困難情形三點：（一）因夏季係屬霉季，烟廠照例派貨稀少，八一九亦無廠盤，故派貨大多停頓，（二）一般單帮客及黃牛黨，利用八一九限價大最搜購，致若千行號藏貨不售，（三）黃牛黨轉售於小販，高價出售，致造成捲烟黑市。社會局對以上各點將力謀解決該業之困難，惟囑各廠仍大量派貨，不得藉故執貨不派，價格仍應遵照八一九之限價，不許超越，幷訂定捲烟批發及零售限價表，以實遵守。茲將捲烟價目探誌如下，（單位金圓一元）</p>

<h3>外銷茶交易少</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，過程頓形岑寂。據悉：通日因當同管制物價綦嚴，而尤以出口物資，均有限價，致日前輸出商對於紅綠茶，雖有胃納，惟一企圖抑價採取，但，執貨者續以產價報挺，複製成本勢難减低，故售意成不放鬆，是以吐納談判復趨相持之局，成交數量遂吿减遜，但市氣依然穩秀。</p>
<p>又悉：進出態度如能稍轉遷就，聞本市將有躉額綠茶，首先運往北菲，同時更擬以相當數量之祁門紅茶，推銷英倫各地，至於內銷花色，授受亦殊平庸，形勢堅定不變。</p>
<h3>食糖實銷暢旺</h3>
<p>報價核售六萬餘包際此中秋節近，食糖實銷轉旺，昨日台糖公司，循例舉行之報價核售二百斤裝特號綿白糖一批，前往申請者五九一單位，申請總數竟達六二二九〇包之多，（按平時申請包數最多不超出二萬包。）該公司爲適應需要，將上項申請數量不予核减，僅以原定二百斤者改配一百廿斤裝，以資普遍供應。其配價則以最低報價，每市担金圓廿八元五角五分核定之。</p>
<h3>南北市塲背道而馳　食米漲跌不一　南市塲白粳所漲獨多</h3>
<p>米市南北二市漲跌背馳，南市上漲，北市略跌，南市場白粳上漲最多，上白粳二十元零五角，計漲一元之多，薄稻爲二十一元四角，距限價僅一角。早稻亦高至二十元零五角，白元已抵二十元零六角六分之限價。昨日開市後，即以去化活絡而吿上挺，交易頗多。北市價格略低二角，特高粳二十一元八角，新粳做二十元。昨日到貨南北二市塲共有四二三一石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>稍見轉緊，老棧單在貨主推售下，大致已轉人實銷手中出現貨，昨日售戶已少，故見回升。兵船粉由六元九角回高至七元，建成粉跳出七元外，各漲二角至三一角五分。老車粉獨見再低一角五分，蓋因上日所跌不多之故，雜牌粉大致回漲二角，麩皮平疲，小麥廠盤仍爲十元零三角之限價。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>仍甚堅定，價格大都已至限價，惟黃豆交易因油廠去化甚佳，故市勢甚堅，高貨難以購進。苞米尙見平定，因上日所成交渚退交甚多，元麥交易較稀，僅本街稍有去化，價格亦定。菉豆高貨一七元三角三分限價有做開，蠶豆·豌豆·交易均少，芝蔴僅有三包五包供本街之零星交易，生仁供求相埒，市勢平平。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>略有參差，生油及蔴油係現貨交易，故市勢仍堅，吉桶生油以限價之故，特退桶以爭生油交易，價爲五十九元八角。小車蔴油站限價，豆油及生菜油因棧單交易，限期出現，並傳將禁止棧單交易，故市價降一元。豆油退入五十元內，爲四十九元五角，生菜油四十五元。豆餅頗堅，各牌餅一致抵四元六角之限度。</p>
<h3>美棉首批分配數額　定六萬九千包</h3>
<p>廠家渴望已久之美棉分配問題，中美雙方業已議定，第一批分配之美棉數量，共計六九，五〇〇包，棉紗幷換棉花之比率，爲二〇支標準紗一件，　棉花五九九磅，（工搬在內，）分配前必須經過實際調査，廠中所存棉花不足兩月使用者，始能獲得優先配給之權利，其數量將視廠方實際需要而定。</p>
<p>又美援華紗布聯營處業已成立，央行代表劉攻芸，國營代表張似旅，民營代表榮一心，美援合作署代表懷德，美援運用會代表沈熙瑞等均興會。當決定即日起，挾既定分　美棉原則進行分配工作，並決定任命劉劍華為主任秘書，潘簡浪負責分配，宋立　負責外銷。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕福來輪船公司緬甸怡美利號（助克拉克斐特），昨日下午抵滬，自印度喀勒基·孟買運來棉花五千三百二十五件，又自香港裝來棉花四千五百件，又橡皮七百五十件，木材一千三百九十五梱，現泊建源碼頭起卸</p>
<h3>籌碼多·人心虛　紗價限盤徘徊　棉布升達限度交易停做</h3>
<p>紗市以月杪關係，紗商大都結束帳務，更因經警管制甚嚴，嚴密査封倉庫。紡建公司隔日配售三千餘包，昨又拋售十支紅豹紗，價爲四百七十八元，十六支仙女價爲五百七十八元，廿支金雙鷄價爲六百四十五元，吉象價六百七十二元，申購者較前爲多，市上籌碼充沛，人心不支趨軟。在塲內亦出手拋售，僅複製業因急需原料見賣稍納，做開二十支金城粗紗較限價軋跌十元，其餘雜牌紗均在限度徘徊，共計成交六十七件。</p>
<p>棉布市塲晨初開盤，以時値秋季，各地實銷發動，買戶鋒湧，喊價均升達限度，交易無法做開，各經紀人遵守當局命令，自動休市，塲內全無成交。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司開售棉布，仍以定價核配，雖以次貨掛牌供應，因秋銷當令，申購極衆。計十磅陽鶴日字布價，每疋廿三元六角，四君子元絲光布卅三元，又二等品漂布廿八元二角，玩傘漂布廿八元五角，雷峰塔精元細布廿八元五角，及跳鯉藏靑嗶嘰二等品，海昌藍細斜印花直貢等，彩花被單，共有十四種，後聞陽鶴Ｂ字細布，有喊加一二角買進一者，市頗俏利。</p>
<h3>放·款·日拆　改為每千元三元</h3>
<p>銀錢信託三公會頃議決：自今（一日）起，放款日拆改爲每千元三元。存款日拆及同業日拆，仍照八月三十日之牌告辦理，並無變動。</p>
<h3>棉布經紀人聯誼會，第二屆第</h3>
<p>棉布經紀人聯誼會，第二屆第三次理監事聯席會議，曾對協助當局抑平市價，及規定佣金額數，作如左之議決：</p>
<p>（一）市塲市價，務須照八月十九日價格，不得超越，並不得再以黑市成交，切勿以身試法，自貽伊戚，如果貨價漲達限度，應即自動停止交易。</p>
<p>（二）市塲紡建公司開售之貨，佣金暫定最低爲每疋金圓二分五釐</p>
<h3>即價前成交出口貨輸管可請海關驗放</h3>
<p>但以十天爲限並附足證件</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據轍管會方面表示：出口貨物實施限價後，出口商於限價日期以前成交者，紛請該處轉函海關予以釋放。該處爲明瞭全部出售數量並結束陳案起見，特規定凡在限價日期以前成交之貨物需輸管會函海關騐放者，統限於九月一日以後之十天內，附同銀行簽證之信用狀副本合約及往來電報等有關證件，函送該處備核，逾期者槪按限價辦法處理。</p>
<h3>呢羢交易發動</h3>
<p>呢羢交易，昨來步見發動，本街門莊帮及西服帮，先後咸有需辦，南京杭州客帮，亦相繼來申採購，花呢嗶嘰華達呢大衣呢，花洋布袖裏綢羽紗襯頭等，均有相當成交，原因爲秋凉實銷將屆，銀根鬆濫，拆息降低，當局竭力壓低物價聲中，行情始終平疲。一般略有頭寸者，莫不紛購物資。</p>
<h3>國行通函各分行處加強檢查金融工作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲配合整理財政，及加强管制經濟辦法，積極加强金融檢査工作起見，特規定「各分行檢査行莊應行注意事項」，由該行稽核處通函各分行處査照，並尅日派員加强檢査。茲錄該規定如次：</p>

<h3>京國立院校敎授代表要求　調整公敎人員待遇　昨招待記者發表談話三點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕首都各國立專科以上學校教授代表聯席會議，爲調整公教人員待遇問題，於卅一日下午三時舉行記者招待會，由各校代表何義均，胡家健，王慕尊等詳細說明關於周整公敎人員時遇之意見如次：（一）比次全國公敎人員薪給之調整，多不合理，應請政府依照戰前標準，重行調整。（二）全國公教人員之待遇，慼按規支薪額金圓券加　計算發給；惟在目前國庫困難之際，得依照抗戰初期付發國難薪金辦法酌予折扣，而以其差　搭發公債或儲蓄券。（三）國立專科以上學校教授之學術研究補助費，原較中央機關各級主管人員第四級之公費爲高，而此次調整，竟僅等於第七級之公費，殊屬欠妥；應請政府調整爲金元券一百元。</p>
<h3>補助學術研究費　乃略表關懷之意　敎部有關人員發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕關於專科以上學校請求增加研究補助費一事，教育部有關人員稱：國立專科以上學校教員學術研究補助費之設置，起於抗戰中期，因當時物價日見高漲，政府於財政困難之下，鑒於教授生活艱苦，略表關懷之意。設置之初，爲數甚微，其後雖歷經調整，仍甚少裨助。及本年七月間本部乃擬定以生活指數計算標準發給，呈院增加。嗣因幣制改革，乃復擬定金圓標準，呈院請發。乃以財政困難，尤其在幣制改革之初，尤須重視收支平衡，俾能度此難關。故獲核定之數如現行標準，以此數爲學衡研究之補助，無從談起；即爲生活之補助，亦甚微少。然較諸幣制未改革以前，確已有改進，仍只稍表政府關懷學人之意而已。</p>
<h3>新舊生入學須塡保證書　家長監護人等慼密切聯繫</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕教部通令直屬各學校，及各省市教育廳局，轉飭各校：凡各校新舊生均應於本期入學前，塡保證書，經對保後，方得辦理入學註冊手續。家長與監護人及保證人，平時尤應密切聯繫。並稱事關學生遵守校規，敦品勵學，務須切實辦理。</p>

<h3>中古劍客重見今日　世界運擊劍賽法義決鬥記</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鐘慶</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕提起了「擊劍」，就很易使人想到曾經煊赫一時，咸風凜凜，身手矯捷，滿腔忠義，除惡鋤奸的外國英雄—劍客們。在中古時期，曾留着不少光榮燦爛的壯烈史。然而時至今日，這種武藝已漸被淘汰，人們祗能在武俠影片中或偶然在新聞片中，一見擊便的鏡頭，極少有目睹的機會。擊劍在世運會中列入正式比賽節目之一，自七月卅日至八月十二日，在這十餘“中，每日均在工程宮中，舉行擊劍比賽，吸引大批好奇觀衆，工程宮門前，車水馬龍，盛况空前。</p>
<p>擊劍決賽之日，記者進塲時，適在休息時間。見有二個身穿白篷布衣褲相連的選手，在練習各秈姿勢，脚登白色跑鞋，面部戴有白色鐵絲面盔，遠望似陳列於埃及開羅博物館之木乃伊。母人手中携有二呎餘長的劍，（頂端有一頭子上有三點突出）在長約廿呎的橡反地毯上，等候決鬥。塲旁裁判席上，坐着身穿陸軍制服，英姿奕奕的軍人，佩着二劍交叉的標記。塲外二旁站立着尙未進塲的選手們，個個神采煥發，殺氣騰騰。選手的衣服中，胸腹部和二袖上，都通有電綫，連在背後臀部之一總挿頭上。比賽開始時，在塲旁一具如皮尺的活動轉動機上，拉出一條能伸縮的彈橫電綫，挿入身後的總插頭內。選手在此賽時，仍可自由伸縮，行動絲毫不受障礙。此電綫同時又通入另一電氣記錄機上。因爲擊劍比賽動作迅速，使裁判　難以分辨誰的劍頭先觸到對方，以致勝負雖分，目前有了這且新式的電動測騐機，此項困難就克服了。</p>
<p>法國擊劍隊和意大利作最後錦標賓，這二個爲歐洲古怪的古國，因此在塲諸選手，莫不「大有來歷」，其祖先皆係歷史上擊劍能手，所以二隊旗鼓相當，銖鋪悉稱。選手們動作矯健，劍光輝映，令人眼花瞭亂，觀衆始終浸沉在緊張刺激的氛圍中。意大利隊先聲奪人，浩浩蕩蕩，六人中竟連勝五次，但以後法國應戰之十名選手，也係久經沙塲之老將，故能奮發雄威，殺意大利隊，片甲不留，終以十一比五，法國獲最後之勝利。</p>

<h3>採訪新聞的競爭</h3>
<p>— 蒼</p>
<p>勝利後，新聞同業圈裏都有一個普遍的感覺，那就是新聞採訪競爭的白熱化。外勤記渚天天拉緊着神經，想發掘條把獨得新聞，來討好自己的讀者。所以，儘管是私交上極誠駡的同業，一到短兵相接的新聞圈裏，就不期而然的變得自私起來。爲了競爭一條新聞，大家勾心鬥角，竟會鬧得而紅耳赤，落得一個不愉快的贋尬塲面。</p>
<p>可是，遠在三四十年以能，美國支加將地方報業採訪的競爭，更是一副張牙舞爪的窮凶極惡報！一家報館常在他敵對報館的辦公室和機器房裏，佈置下間諜，隨時破壞對方工作的羅進行。有時爲了出奇制勝，甚致綁架敵對的外動記者。報館老關對記者說：獨得新聞是報紙銷數裏的紅血球。爲了爭取獨得新聞，記者應不惜冒任何的艱險，犯任何的罪行；探得獨得新聞後，更要設法使其他同業無法獲得。</p>
<p>那時候支加哥的報業中，最狡黠多謀的記者該推霍威（Walter　Crowford　Howcy）了。霍威未出廿歲時，就祖任了一家報館的編輯。一九〇一年美總統麥金蘭逝世的消息，就是他獨得的傑作。原來麥金闌在自法盧地方遇刺後，不死不活的已拖延了一星期。霍咸預料他必死，所以預先寫好了麥金蘭總統逝世的消息，同時也把繼承麥氏的副總統羅斯福的生平歷史搜集齊全，排好了版子。他一方面又聯絡好麥氏家裏的傭僕，麥氏一死，只要誰先打電話通知他，就給賞金十元。所以麥氏死後不數分鐘，霍威的報紙已滿街飛了。</p>
<p>霍威現在也居然厠身美國的名人錄中，人家稱他是編輯家和發明家。他至今已擁有十七種專利權。霍威認爲要發掘好新聞，只有自己親手幹最靠得住。舉個例子說，有一天，兩個汽車掮客和一輛轎車忽然失踪了。失踪前一刹那，這兩個汽車掮客，開了一輛轎車，預備去給未來的主顧丘吉看樣子。而現在丘吉也同吿失踪。這是一條平凡的小新聞。</p>
<p>當警察們的注意力集中在失踪的掮客身上時，霍威却留意到主顧丘吉的行踪。他先查到了丘吉的家鄕，打了個電話給當地的郵局長，那郵局長說：「不錯，丘吉前兩天剛開了輛新汽車回家，他在大都市裏經營得着質不錯，大家都覺得很光榮。」霍威得了這條綫索，就準備了兩輛汽車，一車裝了文字和攝影記者，另一車裝了他僱的三名私家偵探。趕到了目的地，他僱的私家偵探捉住了盜車的丘吉，趕回支加哥。不想另一家報館也得了綫索，於是也動員了一批文字和攝影記者，企岡在半途上攔截霍威這夥人，並且設法把丘吉搶過來。果眞搶不到，就先搶拍一個照，趕回來冲洗付印，也可以搶個先。那裏知道霍咸也早料到了他對方報館的這一手，事先也早作準備。這兩夥人在一個小城相遭遇。霍威的對手在步步跟蹤之餘，覺得無法下手刦奪丘吉，好容易跟到一家飯店裏，他們看見兩個霍威的私家偵探中問，銬住了一個人，就不管三七廿一，搶下了一個規頭，興冲冲的開了汽車，風馳電掣的趕回報館。這一喜非同小可，滿以爲已搶着了獨得照片和新聞。不料照片冲出來，經人指認之下，那挾持在偵探中間的分明是霍威手下的記者，弄得一塲啼笑皆非！而事實上，霍咸早已安排下調虎離山之計，把丘吉隱匿到另一家旅館表，用隱藏的錄音機，獲得了丘吉謀害汽車掮客的全部供詞。第二天，霍威的報紙又大吹大擂一番，說：本報經常以揭破秘密罪行爲素旨，今晨又獨家刊戰凶犯吉之全部翔實供詞……</p>
<p>但因此而指霍威是專事耍弄花巧的人，也是不盡實在的。至少，他的機智，鎭靜，以及他發掘部屬能力的各種特點，足够使他在仕何事業上獲得成功。此外，霍威還是懂人情的人。有一次，有一個苦命的小女孩，寫了封信給査威，請他憐憫，替她找一間房子住。霍威把這小女孩的身世，天天用最動人的筆調和照片，在報上煊染着，最後，一家報館老閻看得實在忍耐不下了，立刻匯了一萬元給霍威，電報上說：「快些給那女孩買幢房子，你委實已經傷了我的心了！」，基四文報的分　廣會　內，日前刋登一則小廣吿，文云：「你可覺得煩惱嗎？請學「吉透伯格」舞，包可將愁悶　走。」</p>
<h3>解愁之首</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>誠然，解愁之道，莫如行樂。而行樂更須及時。引伸此意，則足下想到看電影，上館子，或者結伴旅行等等，便得立即就去。因爲就一般人匆忙的生活而言，要找適宜的行樂時間很不容必。足下一定要擺脫工作，囊中多金，身體健康，興緻濃郁，娛樂才有興味。而足下想到娛樂的時候，其客觀情形，必與上述諸條件，最爲接近。舉一個例來說，足下患牙痛或者凑巧沒有錢的時候，決不會上菜館大嚼一頓也。</p>
<p>其次，鄙見娛樂不宜選定地點及日期。有人路遠迢迢的從都市的一端，坐了三輪車，趕到另一端上某戲院觀劇，適逢客滿，其懊喪爲何如。反不如在街上閑逛，見到到未賣滿座的戲院正上演一齣好戲時購票入座的得計。</p>
<p>至於事先約定出游的日期，屆時因爲人事椌惚，不可測的疾病，甚至天不作美，往往不易如願，或者得不到美滿的結果。最有趣的是：某期時代雜誌的雜錦消息欄內，載稱美國某地氣象學會，測定某日天氣睛朗，邀集當地會員，至郊外聚餐。到了那一天，偏逢傾盆大雨，不但出席的會員，大爲掃興，而且該氣象學會的聲望，也受到了打擊。</p>
<p>筆者並不是「浮生若夢爲歡幾何」的消極論者，也不是所謂「世紀末」的頹廢中義的信徒。不過，人生需要工作，但也需要娛樂，尤其在懊喪愁悶的時候，更須藉娛樂以振刷精神。西諺云：「只有工作，沒有游戲，足以使傑克成爲一個頑鈍的孩子。」措詞雖相反，其意則一也。</p>
<h3>現代藏書家</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>談到現代藏書家之前，不得已做一次「文抄公」，先把洪亮吉「北江詩話」裏的一段話抄下，作爲引子。他說：「藏書家有數等：得一書必推求本原，是正缺失，是謂考訂家。如錢少詹大昕戴吉士震是也。次則辨其板片，注其錯譌，是謂校讎家。如盧學士文弨翁閣學方綱是也。次則搜采異本，上則補石室金匱之遺亡，下可備通人博士之瀏覽，是謂收藏家。如鄞縣范氏之天一閣，錢唐吳氏之花瓶，崑山徐氏之傳是樓諸家是也。次則第求精本，獨嗜宋刻，作者之旨意縱未盡窺，而刻書之年月最所深悉，是謂賞鑒家。如吳門黃主事丕烈，鄥鎮鮑處士廷博諸人是也。又次則於舊家中落者賤售其所藏，富室嗜書者要求其善價；眼別真廣，心知古今，閩本蜀本一不得欺，宋槧元槧，見而即識，是謂掠販家。如吳門之錢景開陶五柳，湖州之施漢英諸書估是也」</p>
<p>在今日，視黃蕘圃的校跋本，其價値過於　金。但是洪先生僅僅稱他是賞鑒家。其買在現在如陶五柳輩的掠阪家，已不可多得。章實齋所說的「橫通」也談何容易。乾嘉時代的藏書家，藏而都能讀，最低限度，也能「眼別眞廢，心知古今」。現在的藏書家呢，有許多是道道地地的藏書家，藏而不閱。大腹賈發了一點財，於是也冒充風雅起來，買上百衲本二十四史，白紙四部叢刊，整整齊齊，裝入書橱，書根劃一，始終觸手若新。所以現在旁的書無人問津，二十四史四部叢刊居然還有市面。</p>
<p>民國初年，陶蘭泉專門喜歡收開化紙的書，竟能買到汲古閣十七史的開化紙本，人家因此稱他呌「陶開化」。</p>
<p>傅沅叔這帝康羅振玉固然是民國最大的藏書家，沅叔也够得上稱他是校離家。帝羅二人刻書不少，且都精好。但是沅叔暮境頹唐，藏書半捐半買的歸入公家。平時也藏而兼販，眼光奇好，北平書賈見了他無一不頭痛。董羅二人是漢奸，死後藏書想已散失。</p>
<p>北方書費中有兩人値得一提，一是文祿堂的王文進，一是通學齋的孫殿起，對於目錄板本之學，極有心得，不僅是「橫通」而已。雖非藏畫家，然而他們確是陶五柳錢聰默一流人物。較之把書籍囤積下來，完全不看，視爲貨物，要好得多了。吾們常熟有一家藏書家，兄弟二人竟把他們父親的楹書，每部都拆開，各人拿半部。如此煞風景的事情，也算得藏書家的怪現象了。</p>
<h3>筆名漫談</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>筆名這名詞來自外國，我國古時只有別號，見於史乘者，像戰國策載秦國有槣里子，高誘註謂「其里有大　樹，因號傳里子也」。不過「槣里」，據鄭樵通志略說是地名。又國策載秦有處士寒泉子，是眞別號。然二人均無著作，故不能說是笨名。</p>
<p>筆名，我國稱「寓名」。最早以文字獲得贈品者，恐要推宋末元初月泉吟社裏的一班詩人了。冠軍「羅公福」實乃連文鳳。殿軍「靑山白雲人」。此外還有什麼「仙村人一「識字耕夫」「騎牛翁」等。這些都是眞正的筆名。當時贈品也着實豐富：像冠軍羅公福得「公服羅一縑七丈，筆五貼，墨五笏之多」。</p>
<p>筆名之最怪者，要推古八大山人的「牛石慧」。此三字連在一起，實在費解；然如這三字草寫，則變成「生不拜君」！按八大山人，明宗室，國變後爲僧，題此筆名，眞血淚都要雙下了。還有亡友弘一大師筆名之多，不可勝計。晚年他自署「一一一老人」，不知者以爲他效六一居士。然如讀過他「南閩十年之夢影」一文，則知他截取古人詩句「一事無成人漸老」和吳梅村臨終詞「一錢不値何消說」中的二個「一」字，遂變成二一老人」了！這又使人多麼悚惕呀，</p>
<h3>馬思聰來了</h3>
<p>— 亭友</p>
<p>凡是常開收音機的聽衆，都很驚奇最近上海音樂風氣的蓬勃。乍看這現象，當然可喜，但仔細一想，事實也很可悲：羣衆的興趣是那麼濃厚，音樂演奏會却那麼兒稀少，於是只能乞靈有限的唱片，聊慰大家的饑渴。各電台的節目，大都是一些十分有限的古典樂唱片，日以繼夜地旋轉，發音早就失去光彩。雖然如此，迷戀於這些唱片的人可眞不少，凡電台工作的職員，都很了解這情形。</p>
<p>正在這個時候，馬思聰先生來了。這是馬思宏去美後的一大喜訊。於是引起了許多人的興奮。</p>
<p>把馬思聰譽為中國的克拉斯勒，我想並非過言，他的小提琴技巧容或不及克氏，而善於吸取民間音樂的精華作曲，却正與克氏相似，而成就則猶勝於克氏。</p>
<p>使人們不易忘懷馬思聽的，不僅由於他的「弦上工夫」，而是他不迷信自己的想像力，肯片實地實踐的工作，吮取了內蒙古·西藏等民問歌謠的旋律精華，變化了傳統的和聲法則，以表現本國人民的風土人情。我總不能忘記馬氏作品中「綏遠組曲」中的思鄉曲，不論是馬思宏奏出的。上一中國民謠風之小提琴訊曲中的秀麗，別緻，固不需我笨拙的筆法來形容了。</p>
<p>近來雖然盛行唱民歌，但以民歌骨髓滲入樂曲的，殊極少見，而像有馬思聰如是成就的尙無第二人。不過發展「國民樂派」的工作，必基於成烈的基本技巧與豐富修養，故我們在盛讚馬思聰之餘，主要的是注意先提高一般音樂學習者的技藝水準，先打定堅固的基礎，倒不必拚命在標語上大做文章。音樂固然應屬於人民，但拚命張貼「人民音樂」的標語，結果一定無補實際！</p>
<h3>皮膚肉設荟</h3>
<p>舊都報載南電，美經濟合作中國分署長「萊普漢」君已正式更定其華文譯名為「賴樸翰」。按此兩名於音的方面，無甚出入，而「賴」爲漢姓，則比前者較合於漢式，由此可知漢式名姓，爲異方人士所注意而感興趣。</p>
<p>此種心情似是英發其端，蓋現任英首相一艾德禮」原譯「阿特利」，經英方之提議而爲「艾」姓。又民國初年之駐華英使「朱爾典」，固爲堂最冠冕之漢式姓名。時以對總統府大禮官「黃開文」，朱氏之，甚同時而高興。</p>
<p>「艾」與「賴」同在一韻，尤爲巧合。此兩姓雖非甚僻，而歷史名人亦不甚多。中國之姓氏，太半本於古代之封建或官守，賴姓是因春秋時有一賴國，艾姓是齊大夫有一艾孔。至於後世則宋代有艾預，由高榜仕至司農；又有艾宣，善畫花竹翎毛的美術家；唐有賴棐，文學之士；宋有賴文進，地理專家。至於前淸雍正及嘉慶時各有翰林一人，光緒年間又有翰林二人。</p>
<p>英國首任駐華大使一賈德幹」，與老段執政時代之國務總理「賈德耀」有似弟昆。抗戰初期在汽車上被日機所傷之「許閣森」，則與許世英同姓（許亦段時之總理）。</p>
<p>戰時英首相「邱吉爾」之姓在中國歷史上原爲「丘」。淸雍正爲避孔聖之諱，特諭凡地名及姓名均加「　」旁，作「邱，」且須讀「期」，故如「章邱」「商邱」「任邱」等縣名，皆係加ㄎ，但人民口頭上仍讀「丘」，無伕禁止。「邱吉爾」之「邱」，若依照雍正所限定之音讀「期」，則去原音遠矣。</p>

<h3>中紡股票月中發行　七成充金圓券保証準備　十分之三委託國行代售　票面一百圓分有記名無記名兩種</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] In order to replenish issuance reserves and increase national treasury revenue, the government has decided to convert state-owned enterprises into marketable securities by issuing stocks. Part of these stocks will be allocated to supplement issuance reserves, while another part will be formally sold. Relevant departments of various state-owned enterprises are now beginning to prepare separately for matters related to stock issuance. Regarding the methods for issuing stocks of the China Textile Industries Corporation (中紡公司), Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 31st, gathering Director of the Department of Commerce Deng Hanliang, Director of the Control Department Fei Mingyang, and other relevant directors to discuss the matter. The complete methods were decided on the evening of the 31st. According to the decision made in these methods, after the China Textile Industries Corporation completes its alteration registration, it will be transformed into a marketable security, issuing six million shares with a face value of one hundred gold yuan per share. Active preparations are currently underway with the aim of starting the issuance within five days from the 10th to the 15th of the month. Excluding the allocation of seventy percent to serve as a guarantee reserve for the issuance of gold yuan notes, and the transfer of stocks to the Issuance Supervision Committee, the remaining thirty percent will be sold publicly on the market. The sale will be handled by entrusting various national banks to act as agents. The stocks will be divided into two types: registered and unregistered. There will be no restrictions on the public purchasing the securities. The stocks will be issued in full value. Although the face value of the stocks is one hundred gold yuan, the selling price will be above one hundred gold yuan. This is because when the China Textile Industries Corporation was valued in the past, only the machinery and real estate were included in the estimate. Finished products, raw materials, and other assets were not taken into account. At that time, the estimated assets of the China Textile Industries Corporation were over 145 million US dollars, which is far from the actual value. Therefore, the selling price will be higher than the original estimate. The public will still be happy to purchase them. These stocks can be listed on the market around the 15th. However, it is not necessary to wait for the securities exchange to resume operations; the stocks can be sold directly through the various national banks. The methods for issuing stocks of other state-owned enterprises are also currently being drafted by the relevant supervisory authorities.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] Since the promulgation and implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, initial achievements have already been seen in reality. An authoritative figure familiar with the political situation stated to reporters on the 31st that the reform of the economy must rigorously implement austerity and conservation. Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the government has successively announced various laws and regulations, with concrete and detailed steps for increasing tax revenue and controlling commodity prices. This not only demonstrates its determination for economic reform but also shows the government's efficiency in handling affairs, which is a fundamental condition for the success of this reform and deserves our praise. However, there are also unavoidable omissions, namely, that there is still insufficient attention to austerity and conservation. The original Emergency Measures contained important provisions regarding the reduction of waste in state-owned enterprises and the regulations on the salaries of civil and military officials. Their impact on the success or failure of this economic reform is no less than that of increasing tax revenue and controlling commodity prices. However, the government has not yet issued concrete and detailed regulations for the above measures, which makes people suspicious. We should not neglect the example of the British, who used passive measures to overcome their economic difficulties. The current number of civil and military officials and the enormous amount of funds the national treasury bears each month for their upkeep show that austerity measures are urgently needed. The authoritative figure then continued to offer his opinions on austerity measures, stating that the reorganization of state-owned enterprises should begin with the reduction of redundant personnel. Although layoffs may face certain difficulties in practice, the government must have the determination and must separate unemployment relief from national personnel recruitment. Then layoffs can be successful. In addition to this, saving on various materials is also of paramount importance. We should still follow the austerity measures of the Anti-Japanese War period as a lesson for today. Then the goals of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures can be fully achieved.</p>
<h3>財經緊急處分　三項補充辦法　政院經管會今將討論</h3>

<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, on the 31st] The Grain Administration Committee of the Legislative Yuan, in view of the repeated occurrence of corruption cases in grain administration agencies, believes that this is due to a lack of reasonable supervision of grain policies or their implementation personnel. The committee is scheduled to hold a symposium at 10:00 AM on the 1st to exchange opinions in order to correct these issues.</p>
<h3>烟煤調供處將設滬</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the National Resources Commission will jointly establish a Bituminous Coal Adjustment and Supply Office to take over the bituminous coal supply work after the dissolution of the Fuel Control Commission.

<h3>政府將令全國　禁止秋節餽贈</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, on the 31st] The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. At a time when the suppression of the rebellion is in full swing and the currency reform is just beginning, people both at the front and in the rear should strive for thrift to accomplish great deeds. It is reported that the government will soon issue an order to the entire country strictly prohibiting gift-giving, receiving gifts, banquets, etc., in the name of the Mid-Autumn Festival. It will also issue orders to various localities prohibiting shops from manufacturing seasonal Mid-Autumn Festival foods in order to eliminate extravagance and emphasize thrift.</p>
<h3>臨時財產稅　施行條例草案</h3>
<p>立院財金會重行審訂</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] The Financial and Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a preliminary review meeting on the draft implementation regulations for the Provisional Property Tax Law at 10:00 AM on the 31st in the West Hall on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. The meeting was chaired by Committee Member Zhang Jingyu, and Director Jiang Shuge of the National Tax Administration was invited to attend. The initial draft prepared jointly by the National Tax Administration and the committee's specialists was discussed. However, since the monetary reform and the issuance of gold yuan notes, many articles in the draft Provisional Property Tax Law needed to be revised, and the draft implementation regulations also needed to be revised accordingly. As a result, it was decided to appoint five committee members – Zhang Jingyu, Cui Jingbo, Lu Yuwen, Liu Zhendong, and Jin Shaoxian – to organize various opinions and reconvene a five-person subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 2nd to revise the initial draft before submitting it to the committee's review meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>蓉鎳幣貪汚案　各方咸主嚴辦</h3>
<p>[Report from our Chengdu office on the 31st] The Chengdu newspapers on the 31st all published evidence and facts of the corruption and fraud involving nickel coins at the Chengdu branch of the Central Bank. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly and the Chengdu Municipal Assembly have jointly sent a telegram to the central government requesting a thorough investigation. Sichuan legislators Xu Zhongqi and others have jointly telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng, requesting that a high-ranking official be sent to conduct a thorough investigation. It is generally believed that this is the first corruption case in the country since the implementation of the new economic policies, and all parties advocate for strict handling.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The panic buying has paralyzed the Chengdu market on the 31st. Daily necessities such as rice, wheat, and meat have disappeared. Many citizens are left with empty pots and await hardship. Statistics show that Chengdu prices have jumped three to four times in the past ten days. However, the authorities are still determined to suppress prices. The Sichuan Price Control Committee was established on the 1st, and the municipal government began distributing subsidized rice.</p>
<h3>東北政會延期改組</h3>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang office on the 31st] The Northeast Suppression Headquarters Political Committee, due to the special circumstances in the Northeast, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval of a larger new staffing plan than originally stipulated, while currently shrinking the existing staff. Since the Executive Yuan has not yet replied, the reorganization has been postponed.</p>
<h3>調整軍人恤金</h3>
<p>聯勤總部擬定方案</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] An official in charge of the Pensions Department of the Combined Service Headquarters stated that, following the currency reform, the various pensions for military personnel should be calculated in gold yuan and adjusted accordingly. Plans for the army and navy have been drafted and submitted for approval and implementation. It has also been decided that all annual pensions for this year that have not yet been issued will be signed and issued only after the adjustment plan has been approved. This is because annual disability pensions for the army and navy are issued once a year, and according to regulations, if adjustments are made during the year, those already issued will not be supplemented. Therefore, the above suspension of signing and issuance is actually a measure to protect the interests of pension recipients.</p>
<h3>蘇將增省委額　容納民靑兩黨</h3>
<p>各廳處奉令赶辦移交</p>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang office on the 31st] It is learned that after the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the number of provincial committee members will be increased from ten to thirteen to accommodate the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party.

<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] Wu Yunfu arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 31st and visited Sun Yueshi, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, in the afternoon to discuss matters for a long time.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, on the 21st] The National Economic Research Committee held its fourth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 31st in the West Hall on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. The meeting was chaired by Liu Ziya, and more than ten committee members including Li Zonghuang, Xue Dubi, and Wu Yunfu were present. The meeting began with reports from the conveners of each group on the progress of their research, followed by a discussion of the second group's proposal to amend the first resolution of the third general meeting. The first resolution of the third general meeting regarding requesting the government to quickly establish a commodity standard currency system to replace the legal tender (法幣) appeared to require change since the government had already announced currency reform on the 20th of this month. After discussion by the second group, it was proposed to amend the first resolution of the third general meeting to "Study the technical issues of maintaining the credibility of the gold yuan." It was resolved that: (1) The Ministry of Finance should consult with the Ministry of Communications and entrust all postal branches across the country to assist local public and private banks in quickly exchanging large amounts of legal tender, aiming to exchange more than half of the prescribed amount within one month, and to widely distribute subsidiary coins. (2) The Ministry of Finance should pay attention to ensuring that banks exchanging gold yuan notes do not reduce the fineness of gold bars stamped with goldsmiths' marks when exchanging gold bars, and prevent the occurrence of a black market for silver dollars. (3) The Ministry of Finance should strictly order executors to thoroughly implement laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>對七五事件願負全責　傅作義自請懲處　電長二千餘言情詞懇切</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office on the 31st] Fu Zuoyi telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng on the 30th, requesting punishment for himself regarding the responsibility for the July 5th Incident. This news was published on the first page of yesterday's newspaper. The original telegram was over two thousand words long and stated in brief: "Having read the investigation report of the Control Yuan, clarifying the incident and the personnel who should be punished, it is noticeable that Zuoyi is not among them. In order to fully demonstrate the government's consistent care for young students, I respectfully follow the well-known instruction that 'punishment should start from the top.' I am willing to fully bear all responsibility for the incident and request severe punishment to appease the situation."</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Beiping, on the 31st] Fu Zuoyi telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng, stating his views on handling the "July 5th" incident and listing the following four reasons to request punishment for himself:</p>
<p>Sympathy for Students</p>
<p>(1) The young people from the Northeast have experienced extreme hardship. This time, after enduring dangers and traveling to Beiping, they should, in both reason and sentiment, receive the deep care of the government and the greatest sympathy of society. However, due to the impact of the war and material difficulties, although many efforts have been made, they have not been given timely and appropriate resettlement. Regardless of how unruly the students' actions were, the occurrence of the July 5th incident, in which eight students died, nineteen were injured, and one merchant died, is an undeniable fact. In addition to my grief, I am willing to bear the responsibility myself, and with my own sacrifice, I express the government's utmost concern for young people, so that the dead may rest in peace and the living may receive some comfort. And young students, after this painful lesson, should know that the conspiracies and provocations under the slogan of sympathy and instigation actually contain the sinister and poisonous goals of those who are</p>
<p>Using others as tools and recognizing the schemes of conspirators</p>
<p>raising vigilance. Sacrificing Zuoyi alone can call back countless young people to be loyal to the country and loyal to the government.</p>
<p>Respecting the Assembly</p>
<p>(2) At the beginning of the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, the Assembly is a legitimate organ of public opinion, leading the people, assisting the government, and its position is extremely lofty, and its responsibilities are even greater. All citizens should respect its powers and responsibilities, and the government should either be responsible for receiving it or provide it for reference depending on the actual situation of any resolution. This time, the resolution of the Municipal Assembly on the resettlement of students from the Northeast in Beiping, regardless of whether its wording was inappropriate or not, and not having been delivered to the government, unexpectedly suffered violent destruction. This is not only a major damage to democratic constitutionalism but also creates a bad precedent for the loss of legal protection by national assemblies. I am eager to maintain constitutionalism and regret that I was unable to prevent it beforehand. Considering the responsibility, and weighing the facts, I have failed in my duty.</p>
<p>Caring for the Police and Gendarmerie</p>
<p>(3) During the July 5th student parade, the police and gendarmerie were ordered to maintain order. I strictly ordered that all those approaching the students must be unarmed, and officers of all levels of the police and gendarmerie also repeatedly warned that no bloodshed was allowed, and no one issued an order to fire; from morning to dusk, the police and gendarmerie personnel always maintained public order while enduring hunger and thirst, without hitting back when hit, or verbally abusing. Although the students' actions were激越, fortunately, no accidents occurred; it was reported that after the announcement of martial law at 7:00 PM, a conflict unfortunately occurred between the students and the military police. According to the situation at the time, it is contested as to where the first shot came from. The students claimed that they were about to get up and leave, while the military police claimed that the students got up and the shooting occurred at the same time, mistakenly believing that the students were starting to seize guns, and in emergency and fear, this unfortunately caused the bloodshed. More than 20 police officers maintaining order were also injured. Local public security agencies have the solemn responsibility of protecting the lives and property of the people. After the declaration of martial law, they have the power to maintain public order and suppress riots. The police and gendarmerie personnel endured hunger and thirst, suffered insults, and were then subjected to bloodshed and injuries. One cannot but say that they endured humiliation and maintained their position, and their situation is worthy of sympathy. The responsibility for the July 5th incident cannot be placed on them. Order requires them to maintain it, but the responsibility is shirked onto them. Punishing the subordinates instead of the superiors will lead to a situation where no one will maintain public order in the future, and the impact on the lives and property of the people will be unimaginable. In order to break the past bad habit in officialdom of taking credit for oneself and blaming others, and to avoid the trap of the Chinese Communist bandits of disarming the city's police and gendarmerie, I am willing to bear the responsibility for the incident.</p>
<p>Righteousness and Vigorousness</p>
<p>(4) After the unfortunate occurrence of the July 5th incident, the elders of the Northeast, due to their deep concern for their children, could not help but become agitated in their speech. People from all sides have also paid great attention to the aftermath. Their motives are pure and deeply admirable. After all, the young people of the Northeast are the young people of the Republic of China, and having come to Beiping, they are treated as the young people of Beiping. Caring and concern are shared by all, not just the elders of the Northeast. The people of the Northeast have endured the suffering of wandering since the September 18th Incident, and cannot return home after the victory because the lost territory has not been recovered. They are emotionally depressed and easily agitated. However, this is a call for righteousness and vigorousness and should be cherished and encouraged to inspire loyalty and bravery in suppressing bandits and saving the people. Zuoyi values this precious sentiment and is willing to bear the full punishment for the incident.</p>
<p>Willing to Accept Severe Punishment</p>
<p>The telegram concluded, "This incident cannot be dealt with from a legal point of view according to martial law, but must be punished from an emotional point of view" to quell the disturbance. Now, if the government does not blame me, but allows others to bear all the resentment, then the government's consistent policy of protecting students, especially Your Excellency's virtue of caring for young people, may be misunderstood." It also stated, "Since Your Excellency has authorized me with full power over North China, I should be responsible for the entire responsibility of the incident, which is reasonable and proper. Even when the students in the July 9th parade shouted the slogan 'Shoot Fu Zuoyi,' I was calm and did not mind at all. Although the circumstances of the incident are extremely complicated, since it has unfortunately occurred, I should bear the unfortunate consequences myself, and accept Your Excellency's most severe punishment with a very pleasant mood."</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion of the Press on Journalists' Day</h3>
<p>Today is our own holiday as journalists. Once a year, we recall the past, confront the present, and look to the future. It is indeed the best opportunity for us to conduct self-examination. As we celebrate this special day, we must not only strengthen our belief that "China must progress, and our press must progress first," but also engage in self-reflection, self-encouragement, and diligent effort to fulfill our responsibilities to the nation and society.</p>
<p>The development of the press in our country, like other endeavors, can be divided into three stages, with the War of Resistance Against Japan serving as a watershed. From the founding of the Republic of China to the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan was the first stage for the press in our country. The press aspired to follow the path of Britain and the United States. All journalists in the country yearned for the ideals of British and American-style liberalism, striving for freedom of speech and seeking speed in news reporting. However, in essence, the press in our country at that time was still different from the press in Britain and the United States. The newspapers in Britain and the United States all operated on a large scale, while the newspapers in our country, although also trending towards commercialization, were still private institutions for scholars to discuss politics. With the exception of a few major newspapers in Shanghai, newspapers in other regions all used discourse as a means to attract readers. However, after the September 18th Incident, as the nation faced increasing difficulties, the press in our country began to undergo fundamental changes. Whether it was private newspapers or party-run newspapers, they all shared a common intention. Although the opinions of various newspapers sometimes differed, they had a common and consistent understanding of the belief that "the nation is supreme and the country is supreme." The purpose of any discussion was always to eliminate national crises and secure the freedom and survival of the nation. Therefore, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the press in our country made very significant contributions to the completion of domestic peace and unification.</p>
<p>The press in our country entered the second stage with the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, newspapers across the country stepped forward and completely dedicated their publications to the nation, allowing it to use them. As a result, the press transformed from institutions for scholars to discuss politics into powerful tools for promoting national policies. At the same time, journalists across the country gained a further understanding that the fate of the press was inseparable from the fate of the nation, and that they could not survive without the nation. Even newspapers that had previously strived for freedom of speech became public propaganda organs that largely accepted government guidance. They not only wholeheartedly welcomed government censorship of news, but also strictly adhered to wartime news policies in both speech and news reporting, and rigorously implemented the program for resisting Japan and building the nation. Therefore, during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we journalists made unparalleled contributions to the victory of the war. We not only earned the deep trust and respect of the people of our country, but also gained international recognition. Thinking about it today, we still regard it as an unparalleled honor for us journalists.</p>
<p>However, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the press in our country not only failed to develop and grow, taking it to the next level, but instead faced two major crises, causing the press to become dim and colorless. The first is the external crisis. Because domestic warfare had not ended, with flames of war raging everywhere, social unrest, economic hardship, transportation blockages, and business stagnation resulted. The press in our country was the first to suffer a major blow. The recent decline in circulation and limited reach of various newspapers is simply unprecedented in the past fifteen years. Some newspapers have even been forced to cease publication due to poor material conditions and inability to sustain operations. As the press became depressed, journalists were naturally the first to bear the brunt. Because of the meager salaries, they were not only unable to work in peace or pursue continuing education in their spare time, but the majority of journalists were also struggling on the brink of unemployment and starvation. The request by colleagues in Hankou to be paid at the same rate as public school teachers and civil servants shows how envious they are of public school teachers and civil servants, which is a perfect example. The second is the internal crisis. Because we journalists, stimulated by international trends, are undoubtedly infatuated with "freedom of the press," while at the same time often neglecting "the responsibility of the press." Therefore, in the recording of news or the expression of opinions, we only seek the pleasure of personal will, regardless of the interests of the public. As a result, the records of speech inevitably deviated from the norm, and some journalists, acting as they pleased, even abandoned the position of the nation and the people. Over the past three years, disputes in the press have emerged one after another. While this may be due to various unexpected reasons, the fact that some of our journalists lacked a sense of responsibility to the press may not have been an internal crisis. Looking to the future, if we journalists still fail to take warning about the responsibility of newspapers, then in the future, the press in our country may not be able to fully undertake the important mission of promoting social reform and advancing national construction.</p>
<p>In short, the dual crises facing the press in our country are not only sufficient to hinder the development of the press in our country, but also a stumbling block in the path of national construction, which should not be ignored by the nation and the public. In addition to hoping that the government will find ways to salvage the crisis facing the press across the country, we also hope that our colleagues will be able to encourage themselves and strive to improve the press. However, for the press to progress, journalism education must progress first. Therefore, as we celebrate Journalists' Day today, we sincerely hope that the education authorities will pay special attention to the training of talented journalists and the continuing education and research of current journalists, and we first express our unconditional support for the initiative of more than ten journalists in Shanghai today to establish a "Shanghai News Museum."</p>

<h3>Four-Power Commanders in Germany Hold Meeting to Discuss Unifying Berlin Currency Based on Co-Management Principles to Draft Plan Moscow Negotiations to Continue During Meeting</h3>
<p>[United Press Association, Berlin, 31st] The US Information Center announced on the afternoon of the 31st, Berlin time: The military governors of the four powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, stationed in Germany will hold a meeting in the Allied Control Council at 5 pm, which is the first official affirmative statement. It is reported that the four governors will meet in the name of a "special committee" rather than the Allied Control Council.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, London, 31st] Diplomatic sources here: The four-power occupying forces commanders meeting held in Berlin today will last for a week. It is also said that a new meeting between the three-power representatives and Molotov will not be convened before the four-power Berlin meeting submits a report to their respective governments.</p>
<p>[United Press Association, London, 31st] A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated on the 31st: The current stage of the Moscow four-power talks has come to an end. The four-power military governors stationed in Germany will hold a meeting in Berlin, possibly this afternoon of the 31st. It is also said that the Moscow meeting will be suspended until the four governors have completed negotiations on the Berlin currency system. He said, "Preparations are underway in Berlin to prepare the technical aspects of the four-power commanders in Germany to discuss the problems between the Western countries and the Soviet Union. After the Berlin meeting is over, the governments concerned will receive a report and the talks in Moscow can be resumed." From this statement, it can be seen that the Moscow consultations have reached a decision on the Berlin currency system after a month, but there is no sign of lifting the blockade. It still remains for the four commanders to agree on the use of a unified currency in Berlin. Although it is a small matter, the four commanders' meeting will be the first step in restoring the four-power co-management of Berlin (which may later be extended to Germany). The agenda includes only the currency system issue. It is speculated that the four commanders have been ordered to implement the decisions reached in Moscow in principle. Sources with access to information said that the timetable for resolving the Berlin crisis seems to be: (1) The Moscow agreement instructed the four military governors stationed in Berlin to instruct the currency policy. This move was completed on the evening of the 30th, advocating the circulation of East German marks under four-power co-management. Second, the four governors discussed the actual steps of the new plan, including difficult issues such as the exchange rate between the East and West Mark zones. Third, the four governments approved the decisions and steps of the four governors.</p>
<p>[United Press Association, Berlin, 31st] The military governors of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union stationed in Germany are scheduled to meet in Berlin on the 31st to discuss the implementation of the resolutions of the Moscow four-power talks. US Military Governor Clay told the United Press Association that the four governors' meeting has been decided to be held on the 31st, but the location and date for the restoration of the Allied Control Council for Germany have not yet been determined. According to authoritative sources, the four governors' meeting is to discuss the reform of the Berlin currency system. Since the collapse of the Allied Control Council on March 20, it is the first time that the four governors have gathered together. It is also the first time in weeks that the four governors have been in Berlin at the same time. French Commander-in-Chief Koenig arrived here on the evening of the 29th. His political advisor Seydou, who participated in the talks in Moscow, is expected to return to Berlin today. Clay and British Governor Robertson were still at the Frankfurt meeting on the 30th and rushed back to Berlin on the same day. It is reported that Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky is currently at the Potsdam headquarters outside Berlin. British and American senior financial advisors were ordered to stay here, and another group of advisors is already on their way to Berlin.</p>
<h3>Berlin City Government Asks for Neutral Zone Rejected by Soviet Military Commander Demonstrations Continue, City Council Unable to Reconvene</h3>
<p>[United Press Association, Berlin, 31st] It was generally hoped that the Berlin City Council could resume its meetings without having to move to the Western occupied zone. On the 31st, it was shattered by a letter from the Soviet representative to the Berlin City Council, Sur. Sur asked that the area around the City Council be designated as a neutral zone to avoid disturbances by communist demonstrators and to suspend the meeting, but it was severely rejected by Soviet Commander Kotikov. Kotikov claimed that he had discussed the neutral zone with 50 labor leaders on the evening of the 30th. They unanimously opposed it, so he should not discuss it. City officials plan to move the meeting place to the Western District, but this decision will not take place immediately before the Moscow Conference communique.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, Berlin, 31st] Hundreds of demonstrators waited in front of the Berlin City Hall this morning, waiting for an opportunity to present the demands of the "labor masses" to the City Council, which was expected to convene soon. However, the City Councilors decided that the City Council could only be convened after the Moscow Conference communique was announced.</p>

<h3>Burmese Government Forces Occupy Northwest Counties of Yangon</h3>
<p>[France News Agency, Yangon, 31st] Burmese government forces have completely occupied the counties northwest of Yangon. The Burmese government will severely punish those who have committed espionage and sabotage crimes. They will be sentenced to death once discovered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yangon, 30th] A Chinese rice mill owner who arrived here today told reporters that his rice mill in Kyangin Mangi was recently robbed by hundreds of ill-equipped Communists. He said: A small number of police or troops would be enough to save him from the loss of a total of 7,000 bags of grain. He revealed that the looting continued for two days without a break. Observers believe: If the government does not substantially increase the number of troops, this kind of unfortunate event will continue to occur. They said: The battlefield reports in the past May showed that the Communist forces were extremely weak. The Communists actually dispatched only about 500 people at a time. The usual battles were only skirmishes between 50 to 100 people on both sides with rifles and machine guns.</p>
<h3>Human's Cabinet Formation May Receive Parliamentary Support The Hope for Resolving the French Political Crisis Communists Call on Workers to Parade and Demonstrate</h3>
<p>[France News Agency, Paris, 30th] The French National Assembly is scheduled to meet at 4:30 pm tomorrow to vote on whether to approve Human's acceptance of the new cabinet.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, Paris, 30th] Since Human agreed to organize a new cabinet, there is great optimism about resolving the political crisis. It is believed that Human can get the support of a majority of 311 votes in the National Assembly. It is generally believed that if necessary, Human can concurrently serve as the Minister of Finance in the new cabinet. Political circles here also believe that the fatal blow to the previous Human cabinet (provincial elections) has now been eliminated, because the National Assembly has passed the postponement of this election, and the approval of the Senate seems to be no problem.</p>
<p>The Socialist Party issued a statement tonight, criticizing Leno's proposed economic plan, which cannot save the financial crisis and cannot meet the stability of workers and society, so it will inevitably lead to a cabinet crisis. Finally, the Socialist Party's statement expressed dissatisfaction with the recent newspaper campaign against the Socialist Party, pointing out that it should be responsible for the government's instability.</p>
<p>[United Press Association, Paris, 30th] Human announced tonight that he will organize a middle-of-the-road cabinet. When Human discussed policies with moderate leaders, the Communists launched workers' parades and demonstrations, advocating for a general election. The Communist Party won the most votes in the 1946 election, which was noted by domestic conservatives. De Gaulle also agreed to the general election, hoping to control the parliament through it. After Human left the Presidential Palace, he told reporters, "I believe that the time is pressing and the people can no longer wait. After consulting with the leaders of various parties today, I feel that I still have the possibility of obtaining a majority of votes. Although the organization is difficult, I believe it will be successful."</p>

<h3>Tito Intensifies Grasp on Power Changes in Senior South Government Officials Rankovic Promoted to Deputy Prime Minister, Cattarci as Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 31st Broadcast: The Presidium of the Yugoslav National Assembly issued an order on the 31st to transfer senior government officials. Non-Communist Foreign Minister Shemik was removed from his post, Deputy Prime Minister Cattarci was promoted from Chairman of the Control Committee to Foreign Minister, and secret police leader Rankovic was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister while retaining his position as Minister of the Interior. Both of them are confidants of Tito. This transfer shows Tito's intensification of his grip on Yugoslavia and poses a greater threat to the Cominform.</p>
<p>[United Press Association, Prague, 31st] The South Communist newspaper "One Bolba" denounced on the 31st the Albanian authorities for "conniving at the anti-South movement in Albania." It also said that South citizens are currently in a systematic irresponsible smear and abuse.</p>
<h3>British Pacific Fleet Strength Determined to Increase</h3>
<p>Navy Department Implements Long-Term Plan</p>
<p>[France News Agency, London, 31st] A British Navy Department spokesperson said that as soon as British domestic finances have surplus funds available, they will increase the strength of the Pacific Fleet, but this increase in strength may not be possible in the near future. The spokesperson also pointed out that the recent statement by British Pacific Fleet Commander Boyd that the British Pacific Fleet will increase its strength to pre-war levels actually refers to the British Navy Department's long-term plan and not to the present.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, London, 31st] The British Ministry of Defense denied the news carried by the Daily Vanguard that the British government will stop demobilization, extend the service period, or conscript new recruits, but also said that this matter has been considered.</p>
<h3>Albania Interferes in Greek Civil War UK, US, and France Will Protest US Blames Greek Officers for Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>[France News Agency, London, 30th] The British Foreign Office officially confirmed tonight that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are discussing possible measures to take against Albania. For months, Albania has been accused of harboring guerrillas fighting against the Greek government forces and assisting General Markos on the battlefield. The three countries may jointly lodge a strong protest with Albania. The recent offensive by the Greek government forces against the guerrillas does not seem to have had much success due to the assistance of the Albanian side. The protests of the three countries may appease the morale of the Greek government forces. On the other hand, it is believed here that some reports from Athens pointing out that the Greek government forces may be forced to invade Albania are exaggerated. The current conflict between the Cominform and Tito has formed a new situation in the Balkans. The invasion of another country by the Greek army will undoubtedly cause an absolutely serious situation.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, Athens, 30th] A spokesperson for the Greek Army General Staff commented on the criticism made by Frett, the director of the US Military Mission to Greece, at a press conference, that the commanders of the Greek battlefield in the Grammos Mountains condoned more than 5,000 guerrillas to escape into Albania, saying that the press conference was confidential in nature and that Frett's words were misunderstood in many ways. However, according to the Greek Morning Post, the officers involved by Frett have been dismissed.</p>

<h3>The Question of Withdrawing US Troops from South Korea: The US Has Made No Decisions; the Status of the New Korean Government Will be Determined by the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] A US State Department spokesperson stated at a press conference today: The US government has not made any decisions regarding the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea before the conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in Paris.

<h3>Allied Headquarters Officials Hint to the Japanese to Organize an Anti-Communist Committee; the Japanese Communist Party is Planning an Anti-Occupation Movement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] Dr. Williams, a senior official in the Allied Headquarters' Political Affairs Section, told the press today: Japan's establishment of a Committee to Investigate Subversive Government Activities, similar to the US House Un-American Activities Committee, would likely receive Allied Headquarters approval. He also stated that the establishment of such a committee is currently under consideration. If the Japanese side requests it, the committee may be established. The purpose of establishing this committee is clearly to prevent communists and those with communist ideas from holding public office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] According to Japanese Communist Party leaders Sanzō Nosaka and Yoshio Shiga, who told Central News Agency reporters: The party will soon announce its peace treaty objectives, including demands for the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces and the independence of Japanese politics and economy. The Japanese Communist Party's announcement of peace conference objectives at this time clearly aims to introduce the Cold War into Japan. Japanese Communist Party leaders do not expect a peace conference to be held in the short term, so their announcement of peace terms is merely a new development in the Japanese Communist Party's anti-occupation movement. For the past two months, the Communist Party has been engaging in anti-occupation work under the guise of a "national independence" movement, with considerable success, and has won the support of some non-communist elements.</p>

<h3>Implementing Effective Measures to Contract Currency: 200,000 Tons of Materials to Be Sold Off Starting Today; All Kinds Total Tens of Thousands; Mostly Daily Necessities; Retail Stores Open with Low Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to cooperate with the government's national policy of contracting currency and stabilizing the currency value, the Central Bank, in conjunction with the Materials Supply Bureau, will begin a large-scale sell-off of materials today. Currently, the Central Bank controls over 200,000 tons of materials, valued at 40 million US dollars, mostly daily necessities. There are two ways to sell them: one is a nationwide auction, and the other is large-scale retail sales. The Materials Supply Bureau has rented the ground floor of the Seven Heavens (Yong An Company's new building) as a retail store, classifying and displaying daily necessities. The quality is excellent, and the prices are also lower than the market. Director Li Lixia of the Central Bank said after guiding reporters on a tour: Selling off a large amount of surplus materials will greatly help to contract currency and stabilize prices. The surplus materials are US military supplies. The items sent to the front lines for soldiers during the Great War were all top-quality goods. After seeing the displayed goods today, everyone will know that the surplus materials are by no means the scrap metal that is rumored to be. The quality of all the goods is superior. The selling prices are decided by the Evaluation Committee and are all lower than the market prices. The retail store is scheduled to open for business today, and it is expected that those who come to buy will be crowded.</p>
<p>The reporters, accompanied by Deputy Director Chen Shuzeng, Director Li Lixia, Secretary Zhao Chenguan, etc., visited the 15th warehouse of the Materials Supply Bureau. This warehouse was formerly the site of the Mitsubishi Corporation's warehouse. It has four floors, filled with surplus materials that have been sorted out, totaling more than 120 tons, with about 20,000 kinds, including paper, cloth, paint, photographs, calculators, food, ice cream powder, women's cosmetics, etc., everything is available. Relevant personnel said: In the past, due to evaluation problems, the sell-off was delayed. In the future, a large-scale supply will be made to the market through auctions and retail sales. Due to the large quantity, it will change the prices in the city and even the whole country.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Island Warehouse Occupies 800 Acres</h3>
<p>After visiting the 15th warehouse, we visited the Fuxing Island warehouse of the Materials Supply Bureau, which ranks third in scale. The site covers 800 acres and is divided into seven areas. There are many trucks, transportation equipment, and heavy equipment. In addition to some that have been allocated to the Ministry of National Defense, there are many surplus materials that can be used for civilian purposes. According to Yang YunSong, the group leader of the Materials Supply Bureau who accompanied the tour, told reporters: "The value of the materials shipped from the US Pacific islands is over 300 million US dollars, but when the US transferred and transported them, they were not classified and were mixed together, so sorting them out was particularly time-consuming. The materials displayed in the warehouse after cleaning are of good quality and can be used, and they are of high value. For example, a bundle of thick rope used on the wharf costs no less than a bar of gold. Other items such as car tires and cloth are sold at very high prices on the market." At that time, when our country received the surplus materials, the Central Bank and the Materials Supply Bureau separately received them according to the islands in the Pacific. Most of the materials from Guam and other regions in the Mariana Islands were received by the Central Bank, and most of the materials from the Marshall Islands and other places were handled by the Materials Supply Bureau. When stored, they were all stored in the Materials Supply Bureau's warehouses. There are more than ten warehouses in this city, and the Baoshan warehouse is the largest. The Fuxing Island warehouse, which occupies 800 acres, ranks only third in terms of scale.</p>

<h3>Contractor Absconds with Housing Funds, Seven Guarantors Shirk Responsibility in a Chain, District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau previously put out a tender on Fuxing Island for the construction of lead-roofed houses. A construction contractor, Shen Shiqing, won the bid with the lowest price. At the time, Shen was required to provide guarantees from Yu Zhisheng, Li Linchang, and Chen Dingliang, which the Material Supply Bureau verified as valid. Consequently, they paid Shen half of the total contract amount, 18.7 billion legal tender. Unexpectedly, Shen absconded with the funds. The Supply Bureau, noting the delayed construction, pursued the three guarantors. However, the second guarantor also went into hiding, and both successively engaged lawyers to publish disclaimers and withdrawals of guarantee. The Bureau, suspecting that Shen and others were colluding to defraud the contract funds, immediately filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office. Yu Zhisheng failed to appear in court. Chen Dingliang testified that he was entrusted by Li Linchang, who in turn claimed it was a favor to his friend Dong Zhiyun. Dong claimed that he did not know Shen Shiqing at all but was only entrusted by Zhang Damin, who claimed he was entrusted by his clansman Zhang Jinfang. Subsequently, the court attempted to summon Zhang Jinfang, only to find that he had also fled. The prosecutor in charge, believing that the defendants were mutually shirking responsibility and were all in the same boat, jointly filed a public prosecution against the seven defendants for fraud, and those who had fled were placed on the wanted list to be brought to justice for questioning.</p>
<h3>University Student Accused of Breaking off Engagement, Judge Persuades, Both Parties Attempt Reconciliation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Feng Ji, a Daxia University student, being accused of breaking off his engagement was heard again yesterday by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court. The defendant, Feng Ji, and the plaintiffs, Peng Zhixing and Peng Chuqiao, all appeared in court. Feng Ji provided detailed testimony regarding his acquaintance with Peng Chuqiao, their engagement, and their cohabitation in Shanghai, after which he discovered that Peng was no longer a virgin. He stated that Peng had previously engaged in ambiguous behavior with her brother-in-law and that whether Peng's pregnancy was his child needed to be determined after a blood test of the infant. If confirmed, he would then proceed with the wedding. Peng Chuqiao, in her testimony, vehemently denied writing a letter of repentance and engaging in unchaste behavior. She also claimed that her brother-in-law had never come to Shanghai, and even if he had, it would not prove that he had a relationship with her. At this point, the court urged both parties to attempt reconciliation out of court, repeatedly guiding them to consider the reputation and future of both parties and the happiness of the next generation, advising them not to let their love end in hate. The audience in attendance was moved. The case could have been concluded and a verdict announced in court, but the court, considering that both parties were young university students, granted a two-day extension to attempt reconciliation out of court to avoid legal entanglement. The case is scheduled to be concluded tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Drug Case Cracked on Train, Two Suspects Arrested, Remainder at Large</h3>
<p>On August 13th, the Jinghu Railway Police Department discovered a male passenger on Train No. 6 from Shanghai to Beijing on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway carrying a large package of acidic, yellowish-brown material, identified as narcotics. He was arrested. After being taken off the train at Suzhou Station, the material was tested and found to be heroin, weighing 6.5 kilograms, with an estimated value of 41,100 Gold Yuan. The suspect was escorted back to Shanghai on the same day. The suspect was extremely cunning and, apart from providing the name Zhu Yuansheng, claimed ignorance of everything else. After several days of exhaustive interrogation, he finally revealed the truth on the 17th, stating that the narcotics were entrusted to him by a woman named Chen Lüshi from Haizhou to be delivered to Gao Guiying at No. 10 Yijiabang outside Suzhou Jianmen and to a Mr. Zhang at No. 22 Caoqiaotou behind Suzhou Park. Officers were dispatched to arrest them, but both had already fled. Only Gao Zhu was apprehended. Zhu Yuansheng also confessed that Chen Lüshi would trade the narcotics at the Quanyuan Teahouse in the Maris Small Vegetable Market in Shanghai and that Chen Lüshi cohabitated with the owner of the Dashan Hotel on Tianyao Road on the fourth floor of the hotel. Both principal offenders have now fled upon hearing the news. In addition to continuing to intensify the pursuit, the Police Department will transfer the two arrested suspects to the District Attorney's Office today for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Investigating from a New Angle: The Coal Capital of Jiaozuo, the State of Traffic Suffocation Immediately Restricts Coal Production</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiaozuo, Our Newspaper, 24th] Jiaozuo, this coal capital of the Central Plains, has lost its past glory under the shadow of war. There is no coal for cooking, firewood is sold for 50,000 yuan per catty, which calculates to 100 million per ton of firewood. Large lumps of coal from Xinxiang sell for 2.1 yuan a piece, but Mr. Li Tazhai, commissioner at the Xinxiang Office of the Central News Agency Company, said that large lumps of coal from Jiaozuo only cost 18 million yuan a piece, which was a recent adjustment. Before the adjustment, broken coal cost 1.2 million yuan per ton, enough to buy a pack of cigarettes. Jiaozuo is hidden in the mist. The reporter is determined to go take a look.</p>
<p>The reporter arrived in Jiaozuo, where entry inspection is strict. It is difficult to find an open store on the streets. There are many small vendors, but later it was learned that many of them are "side businesses" of mine employees. Electric lights, which have become rare in Henan Province, shine in the Jiaozuo city area, but they cannot dispel the thick clouds and miserable fog surrounding Jiaozuo.</p>
<p>Central China Coal Mining Company</p>
<p>Originally had two mining areas, one in Lihe, which was destroyed in the early days of the War of Resistance. Currently, the mining area being mined includes the Wangfeng and Lifeng mines. The total area of the mining area is approximately 5,000 tons, and the estimated coal reserves are approximately 2.754 billion tons. From the second year of the Republic to the twentieth year (1913-1931), a total of 22,841,161 tons of coal were produced, ranking third in the country in terms of coal production.</p>
<p>The geology of the Jiaozuo mining area (referring to Lifeng and Wangfeng mines below) belongs to the Carboniferous period. The mining area was originally mountainous, but crustal changes resulted in the collapse of the Jiaozuo mining area. To this day, traces of faults can still be found north of Lifeng. The geological structure of the mining area is roughly Carboniferous and Permian above (including the Taiyuan Series and the Shanxi Series, i.e., the lower Permian and the middle Permian). Below is the Ordovician limestone. Between the two layers is the main coal seam, with an average thickness of about 5.78 meters. The coal seam runs northeast-southwest, sloping at 10 to 25 degrees. It extends approximately 1,600 feet northeast and approximately 5,000 feet southwest with Wangfeng as the center.</p>
<p>In terms of coal quality, it is the best anthracite. Jiaozuo's "Yuhe lump coal" has long been famous in China. Seventeen years ago, Mr. Shen Yijia, who represented China at the International Fuel Conference, compared Jiaozuo coal with more than 1,000 kinds of coal samples collected by the Halconomi Company in Belgium. According to his and the company's person in charge’s judgment, the coal quality of Jiaozuo coal far exceeds that of the best anthracite in the United Kingdom, and its color and luster are as good as graphite.</p>
<p>The reporter, on the day of arriving in Jiaozuo, was accompanied by Director Li Fazong to visit the mining area.</p>
<p>Lifeng and Wangfeng</p>
<p>The engineering and equipment of the two major mines are similar. After briefly viewing Lifeng, the reporter went to Wangfeng, where the mine is located, for detailed observation.</p>
<p>Wangfeng has a 350 K.W. generator, which, together with a 750 K.W. generator in Jiaozuo, is the source of power for the Jiaozuo coal mine. These two machines are operated alternately every week, and the rest time is also the repair time, because they were produced in 1912 and are too old! The upper part of the Wangfeng power plant uses iron plates as a substitute for the ceiling. This is wartime equipment for protection against artillery shells.</p>
<p>Wangfeng has two mine entrances. Currently, because the production is low, only one is used. The lifting of coal cars is controlled by a winch, which is powered by a 160-horsepower and a 30-horsepower motor. In terms of ventilation, a steam-powered ventilator is responsible for sending air into the well. The drainage equipment in the well is an electric pump, powered by a 400-horsepower motor.

<h3>Cheng Intercepts Ship Supplying Communists, Materials and Criminals All Detained</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiangyin, Our Newspaper, 29th] The Criminal Police Team of the Police Department seized a Sun Changsheng Jiang ship supplying the Communists at the Xibei Wai Zha West River on the 26th. The ship was loaded with 39 bundles of raw-edged paper (6.5 reams per bundle) for making ten-line paper, more than 3 tons of scrap iron, and five boxes of movie film, weighing 800 pounds.

<h3>Changsha Central Bank Staff Assault Reporter, Mayor and Bureau Chief Rush to Mediate, Decision to Punish the Assailant, Apologize, and Compensate</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Changsha, Our Newspaper, 31st] Regarding the Changsha Central Bank's assault on a reporter, more than 40 reporters went to the residence of the bank's manager, Xin Xinruo, to question him that night. Mayor Jiang Kunzhu and Provincial Police Bureau Chief Li Jun rushed to mediate upon hearing the news. Xin admitted at the time that he would immediately dismiss the assailant and send him to court. However, the reporters demanded that the punishment should also include the bank's deputy manager, Chen Zhongfan. Xin could not immediately agree to this, and Mayor Jiang persuaded him. On the 31st, the bank invited six representatives from the reporters to the Central Bank, where the bank would offer a satisfactory apology and compensation.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Fu Zidi and Zhu Yeqiao, reporters from the Hunan Construction and Liang Bao newspapers in Changsha, went to the Central Bank for interviews at 2:00 PM on the 30th and were refused, resulting in a conflict. It is reported that bank staff kicked them from upstairs to downstairs, and Zhu was beaten by more than a dozen police officers, causing injuries to both. They were detained for more than 20 minutes before being released. Fu and Zhu have gone to the court for medical examination and have accused the bank of assault and restricting personal freedom.

<h3>Autumn News from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent Chuyu Sheng</p>
<p>Play for a while, the Gold Yuan Note has just been issued, prices are still stable, and the average person can enjoy the first stable prices after the victory with the famous West Lake.</p>
<p>Market Dynamics</p>
<p>Speaking of the Gold Yuan Note, in the four or five days after Hangzhou received the news, some speculators were eager to make a move. Rice, vegetables, pork, and cloth all experienced drastic price increases without any basis in the "August 19th" price reduction. Later, public opinion in Hangzhou unanimously called for the government to deploy a large number of police to arrest the illegal merchants one by one. Since then, department store prices have fallen straight back to the original prices of August 19th. The factors that cause price increases, in addition to insufficient materials and currency inflation, include</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou dispatch of the 29th] Several days of autumn rain have gradually driven the summer vacationers from Mogan Mountain and Guling down the mountain, and Hangzhou is once again showing its golden age. Groups of tourists, unseen for three months, have once again arrived on the shores of West Lake. Experienced people in Hangzhou say: This year's "autumn tiger" will be short, the autumn flood season can be extended, and the Haining tide will be particularly large. Going to see the tide and back can be done entirely in Hangzhou. Outside of this there are also social factors, especially in China's situation where officials and merchants are indistinguishable, speculators are fearless and desperately raise prices. If the government offices indulge in favoritism, it will foster their arrogance and boldness. If the government offices handle matters impartially, they will naturally know how to restrain themselves.</p>
<p>Advocating for Whom</p>
<p>It is said that some people are advocating for these speculators who were arrested in Hangzhou. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially hosted a press conference for this matter, and their reasons were: (1) There are many types of goods. Except for daily necessities, there is no agreed price. Because the cost of goods is different, the selling price may vary. (2) Various industries had a public agreement to adjust prices before August 19th, and notifying the industry after the 19th would be considered a self-raising of prices. (3) After the 39th, if the purchase price from the place of origin increases or there are other special reasons, and it is necessary to adjust the price, the guild should make adjustments based on the cost. (4) The Chamber of Commerce notified all industries to sell at the gold yuan price converted at the August 19th legal tender price before August 31st. (5) The government's price control laws and regulations must be strictly observed, but merchants have a lower level of knowledge, and the initial implementation should start with education orders. If the special criminal court does not ask about the severity of the circumstances and handles the cases uniformly, then merchants will feel insecure, unable to operate, and seeking to stabilize prices, but causing panic in the commercial market, which is not the government's original intention of stabilizing finance, and should be given administrative punishments by the government to show consideration.</p>
<p>The speculators arrested in Hangzhou, in addition to the Chairman of the Commercial Guild, Jiang Guangyin, sending them to the Special Criminal Court, the rest were bailed out by powerful figures. The Hangzhou public opinion circles are deeply concerned. They sincerely fear how long this good phenomenon of swift and vigorous action can be maintained? Can the arrested people certainly be brought to justice?</p>
<p>Special Relief Donation</p>
<p>Hangzhou's special relief donation should also end in the fall. Overall, it is a joy for everyone, without being distributed to wealthy families, but fully recognized by various trade associations. It is said that there are still about 10 billion that have not been settled. A certain influential committee member once said: "You don't have to donate. Anyway, I will donate at most 500 million." But according to insiders: "He didn't even donate 500 million?"</p>
<p>In the past few days, many stores in the Zhongzheng Street area have automatically posted signs saying "Supporting President Chiang's Restoration of the Original August 19th Price, Big Sale, 10% off." In general, public educators are beaming with joy and have gone to buy some things. They are all saying on their lips that the government's use of power this time is effective, and their hearts seem to be unusually happy. Merchants with such kindness are worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Sighing at Learning</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived, and the newspapers and schools in Hangzhou are about to start school. Every school is crowded with people registering. A small elementary school that is relatively famous only enrolls ten first-grade students, but 129 people went to take the exam. The municipal middle school only enrolls 100 students, but more than 2,000 people took the exam. Not to mention the universities. Two private schools have particularly expensive fees. Going to kindergarten at these schools costs two dan and five dou of rice per semester. The municipal education authorities also have a headache about this, but they say that because of the facilities, teachers, and other factors, it has to be this way. Under such circumstances, we can imagine how many people are sighing at the school gates and how many people are losing the freedom to seek knowledge.</p>
<p>However, the golden age of Hangzhou does not seem to have been lost. You see the boats on the lake are shaking their spirits to welcome customers. The stores selling local products are also working hard to paint their facades, and the vendors in the scenic areas are all smiling to greet the grand autumn season this year.</p>
<p>Manjuelong will once again be fragrant with osmanthus flowers. In Hupao, Shiwu Cave, and Yanxia Cave near Manjuelong, a wave of people will surge again. Is Hangzhou really a place to "play"? In fact, there are still many people living in this environment, and they, like other places, are thinking about how to make their lives better.</p>

<h3>Wholesale and Retail Prices of Cigarettes Set Yesterday by the Social Affairs Bureau; Cigarette Factories Must Not Refuse to Distribute Goods on Pretext of Helping to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the implementation of currency reform and emergency economic measures, cigarette factories of all sizes in this city have suspended the distribution of goods due to unresolved issues regarding price limits and tax increases, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand in the cigarette market. Regarding the issue of price limits, the Social Affairs Bureau has approved it yesterday. Those who had no factory prices on August 19th may refer to the market prices of "August 19th" to set new factory prices, but they must not exceed the market price on that day.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau convened responsible persons from the Cigarette Industry Commercial Guild and the Industrial Guild for a discussion. The two guilds stated three difficulties in the cigarette industry: (1) Because summer is the mold season, cigarette factories routinely distribute fewer goods. There were also no factory prices on August 19, so most distributions were suspended; (2) General single-purchase customers and scalpers used the August 19 price limit to search for and purchase a large amount of goods, causing some firms to hoard goods and refuse to sell; (3) Scalpers resold to vendors at high prices, creating a black market for cigarettes. The Social Affairs Bureau will strive to resolve the difficulties in the industry, but urged all factories to distribute goods in large quantities and not to refuse to distribute goods on pretext of inspecting. The prices should still comply with the price limits of August 19 and should not be exceeded. A table of limited wholesale and retail prices for cigarettes has been set to ensure compliance. The cigarette prices are listed as follows (unit: Gold Yuan 1 yuan):</p>

<h3>Foreign Tea Transactions Few</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market was quiet. It is reported that due to strict price controls, especially for export goods, exporters were trying to suppress prices for black and green tea. However, sellers continued to report strong production prices, making it difficult to reduce production costs, so negotiations became deadlocked, and the transaction volume decreased, but the market atmosphere remained stable.</p>
<p>It is also learned that if the attitude of importers and exporters can be slightly more accommodating, a large amount of green tea will reportedly be shipped to North Africa first. At the same time, it is planned to promote a considerable amount of Qimen black tea to various parts of the UK. As for domestic sales of various types, the transaction volume is also mediocre, and the situation remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sugar Sales Brisk</h3>
<p>With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, sugar sales have turned brisk. Yesterday, Taiwan Sugar Corporation held its usual price quotation and sales of a batch of special grade refined granulated sugar in 200-jin bags. 591 units applied, and the total number of applications reached 62,290 bags (usually the number of applications does not exceed 20,000 bags). To meet the needs, the company did not reduce the applied quantity, but changed the original 200-jin bags to 120-jin bags to ensure widespread supply. The allocation price was set at the lowest quoted price of 28 yuan and 55 cents per dan.</p>
<h3>North and South Markets Diverge; Rice Prices Vary; White Rice Prices Increase the Most in the South Market</h3>
<p>Rice prices in the north and south markets diverged. The southern market rose, while the northern market fell slightly. White rice prices increased the most in the southern market. Top-quality white rice was 20 yuan and 5 cents, an increase of more than 1 yuan. Thin rice was 21 yuan and 4 cents, only 1 cent away from the price limit. Early rice was also as high as 20 yuan and 5 cents, and white yuan had reached the price limit of 20 yuan and 66 cents. After the market opened yesterday, prices rose due to brisk sales and trading. The northern market prices were slightly lower by 2 cents. Special high-quality rice was 21 yuan and 8 cents, and new rice was 20 yuan. The total amount of goods arriving in the north and south markets yesterday was 4,231 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Slightly tighter, old godowns have generally transferred to the hands of spot sales under the push of cargo owners. Yesterday, there were fewer sellers, so it rebounded. Bingshan flour rose from 6 yuan and 9 cents to 7 yuan, and Jiancheng flour jumped out of 7 yuan, with each rising 2 cents to 3 yuan and 15 cents. Only Lao Che flour was lower again by 1 cent and 5 cents, probably because it had not fallen much on the previous day. Miscellaneous brand flour generally rebounded by 2 cents, bran was flat, and the factory price of wheat was still limited to 10 yuan and 3 cents.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Still very firm, prices have mostly reached the price limit. However, yellow bean transactions are strong because oil factories are selling very well, so the market is very firm and high-quality goods are difficult to purchase. Corn is still stable because many of the transactions on the previous day were returned. Yuan wheat transactions are relatively rare, with only a slight amount of sales on this street, and prices are also fixed. Green beans with high-quality goods were priced at 17 yuan and 33 cents, with some sales. Broad beans and peas had few transactions. Sesame seeds only had three or five packages for sporadic transactions on this street. Raw peanuts had roughly equal supply and demand, and the market was flat.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Slightly uneven, raw oil and sesame oil are spot transactions, so the market is still firm. Jilong raw oil is limited in price, so special returns are used to compete for raw oil transactions, priced at 59 yuan and 8 cents. Small cart sesame oil is limited in price. Soybean oil and vegetable oil are lowered by one yuan because of warehouse receipt transactions, limited-term appearances, and rumors of prohibiting warehouse receipt transactions. Soybean oil returned to below 50 yuan, at 49 yuan and 5 cents, and vegetable oil was 45 yuan. Bean cake is quite firm, with each brand cake reaching the limit of 4 yuan and 6 cents.</p>
<h3>First Batch of US Cotton Allocation Set at 69,000 Bales</h3>
<p>The US cotton allocation issue that manufacturers have been longing for has been agreed upon by both China and the United States. The quantity of US cotton to be allocated in the first batch is 69,500 bales. The ratio of cotton yarn to cotton exchange is one 20s standard yarn and 599 pounds of cotton (including labor). Before the allocation, an actual survey must be conducted. Only manufacturers whose cotton inventory is less than two months' worth of use can obtain the right to preferential allocation, and the quantity will depend on the actual needs of the factory.</p>

<h3>Many Chips, Nervous Sentiment; Yarn Prices Linger at Price Limits; Cotton Cloth Rises to the Limit and Trading Stops</h3>
<p>Due to the end of the month, yarn merchants are mostly closing their accounts, and because the Economic Police control is very strict, closely sealing warehouses. The Textile and Construction Company sold more than 3,000 bales every other day, and yesterday it sold 10s Red Leopard yarn for 478 yuan, 16s Fairy price for 578 yuan, 20s Golden Twin Chicken price for 645 yuan, and Jixiang price for 672 yuan. There were more applicants than before. The market chips are abundant, and people's hearts are failing and trending soft. They are also throwing sales in the market. Only the replication industry, which urgently needs raw materials, is willing to buy a little. 20s Jincheng coarse yarn was sold 10 yuan below the price limit, and other miscellaneous yarns are lingering at the price limit. A total of 67 pieces were traded.</p>
<p>When the cotton cloth market opened in the early morning, because it was autumn and the actual sales in various places were starting, the buyers were swarming, and the asking prices all rose to the limit, and the trading could not be done. The brokers complied with the orders of the authorities and automatically closed the market, and there were no transactions in the market.</p>
<p>Also, the Textile and Construction Company sells cotton cloth at a fixed price allocation. Although the supply is listed as inferior goods, it is extremely popular due to the autumn sales season. It is estimated that the price of 10-pound Yanghe Japanese cloth is 23 yuan and 6 cents per bolt, 4 Gentleman Yuan mercerized cloth is 33 yuan, and second-class bleached cloth is 28 yuan and 2 cents, Wansan bleached cloth is 28 yuan and 5 cents, Leifeng Pagoda Jingyuan fine cloth is 28 yuan and 5 cents, and Jumping Carp Hidden Green Billiard second-class product, Haichang Blue Fine Oblique Print Tribute, etc., and colored floral bedsheets, a total of 14 types. Later, it was heard that someone shouted to buy Yanghe B-character fine cloth for an additional 10 to 20 cents, and the market was very popular.</p>
<h3>Loan-Day Interest Changed to Three Yuan per Thousand</h3>
<p>The Silver Money Trust Three Guilds recently resolved that, starting today (1st), the loan-day interest rate will be changed to 3 yuan per thousand. The deposit-day interest rate and the interbank-day interest rate will still be handled according to the notice on August 30th and will not be changed.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Cloth Broker Association, the Second Session</h3>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Broker Association, at the third joint meeting of the second session of supervisors and directors, made the following resolutions on assisting the authorities in suppressing market prices and stipulating commission amounts:</p>
<p>(1) The market price must be based on the August 19th price and must not be exceeded, and there must be no further black market transactions. Do not test the law and cause trouble for yourself. If the price of the goods rises to the limit, the transaction should be stopped automatically.</p>
<p>(2) The commission for goods sold by the Textile and Construction Company on the market is temporarily set at a minimum of 2.5 cents per bolt in gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Export Goods Transacted Before the Effective Date Can Be Released by Customs Upon Request</h3>
<p>But only for ten days and with sufficient documentation</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the Transportation Management Committee, after the implementation of price limits on export goods, exporters who completed transactions before the price limit date are requesting the Committee to forward letters to Customs for release. In order to clarify the total quantity sold and conclude old cases, the Committee has specially stipulated that all goods transacted before the price limit date that require the Transportation Management Committee to send a letter to Customs for inspection and release must be submitted to the Committee for verification within ten days after September 1st, along with relevant documents such as a copy of the letter of credit, contract, and correspondence telex certified by the bank. Those who fail to meet the deadline will be handled according to the price limit measures.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Transactions Initiated</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric transactions were seen to be initiated yesterday. The merchants in the street and the Western clothing merchants all have needs, and Nanjing and Hangzhou merchants have also come to apply for purchases. Flannel, gabardine, overcoat cloth, flower ocean cloth, sleeve lining silk, feather yarn lining, etc., all have considerable transactions. The reason is that the actual sales of autumn are approaching, the money supply is loose, and the interest rate is reduced. In the midst of the authorities' efforts to suppress prices, the market has remained flat. Those with a little money are all buying materials.</p>
<h3>National Bank Issues a Circular to All Branches and Offices to Strengthen Financial Inspection Work</h3>

<h3>Professors' Representatives from National Universities in Beijing Request Adjustment of Compensation for Public Educators; Held a Press Conference Yesterday to Publish Three Points</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 31st] The joint meeting of professors' representatives from national colleges and universities in the capital held a press conference at 3 p.m. on the 31st to discuss the issue of adjusting the compensation for public educators. Representatives from various schools, including He Yijun, Hu Jiajian, and Wang Muzun, explained in detail the opinions on adjusting the compensation for public educators as follows: (1) The adjustment of salaries for public educators across the country this time is mostly unreasonable, and the government should make adjustments again according to pre-war standards. (2) The compensation for public educators across the country should be calculated and paid in gold yuan notes plus, according to the prescribed salary amount; however, at a time when the national treasury is experiencing difficulties, discounts may be given in accordance with the method of paying national crisis salaries in the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, and the difference may be issued with public bonds or savings certificates. (3) The academic research subsidies for professors at national colleges and universities were originally higher than the public expenses of the fourth-level supervisors of central agencies, but this adjustment is only equal to the public expenses of the seventh level, which is inappropriate; the government should be requested to adjust it to 100 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Subsidizing Academic Research Expenses: A Slight Expression of Concern; Remarks by Relevant Personnel of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] Regarding the request from specialized schools and above for increased research subsidies, relevant personnel from the Ministry of Education stated: The establishment of academic research subsidies for teachers at national specialized schools and above originated in the mid-period of the War of Resistance. At that time, prices were rising daily, and the government, under financial difficulties, and recognizing the hardship of professors' lives, sought to express a slight degree of concern. The initial amount was very small, and although it had undergone adjustments, it remained of little help. In July of this year, the Ministry drafted a plan to issue subsidies based on living index standards and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for an increase. Later, due to currency reform, a gold yuan standard was proposed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, due to financial difficulties, especially at the beginning of currency reform, it was necessary to prioritize balancing income and expenditure in order to overcome this difficult period. Therefore, the approved amount is the current standard, and this amount is insufficient to support academic research; even as a living allowance, it is very meager. However, compared to before the currency reform, there has been a definite improvement, and it still only slightly expresses the government's concern for scholars.</p>
<h3>New and Returning Students Must Fill Out Guarantee Forms; Parents, Guardians, etc., Should Maintain Close Contact</h3>

<p>Hoping School Presidents Will Carefully Recommend Students, as Scholarship Amount is 50% or more, to Prevent Exploitation</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Committee held its second meeting yesterday to discuss scholarship matters for this year and decided on the following: (1) This year's scholarships will focus on junior and senior high school students, with a higher proportion allocated to them than in previous years. (2) Junior high school application forms will be distributed to school principals starting today for students to fill out. Senior high school forms will be issued in three days, and university and vocational school forms will be issued in one week. (3) The number of recipients for this year has been determined to be 150 for junior high school, 100 for senior high school, 30 for universities, and 20 for vocational schools, totaling 300 approved recipients. (4) The scholarship standard for this year will be uniformly set at 50% or more of each level of school tuition. (5) In mid-July, the committee issued "Recipient Grade Summary Forms" to each school, stating in the letter that those who did not submit the form would be considered to have automatically withdrawn and would not be eligible for assistance this year. It has now been found that a small number of junior and senior high schools have not submitted the form. They are required to contact the committee in person within three days, or their application eligibility will be canceled. In addition, a "Recipient Investigation Form" was sent out, and most have already been filled out. Those who have not filled it out will also not be allowed to apply. (6) The allocation of slots to each school this year will be absolutely cautious. It is hoped that all school principals will be impartial and recommend students earnestly. If it is discovered that a student from a relatively well-off family is fraudulently claiming a scholarship, it will be immediately canceled. A method of soliciting secret reports will also be adopted to prevent exploitation and fraudulent claims.</p>

<h3>Medieval Swordsmen Revisited Today: A Record of the Fencing Duel at the World Games Between France and Italy</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Zhong Qing</p>
<p>[Our London Airmail Dispatch] The mention of "fencing" easily conjures up images of foreign heroes—swordsmen—who were once illustrious, awe-inspiring, agile, and filled with loyalty and righteousness, eliminating evil and suppressing treachery. In the medieval period, they left behind many glorious and brilliant heroic stories. However, in today's world, this martial art has gradually been eliminated. People can only see glimpses of fencing in martial arts films or occasionally in newsreels, rarely having the opportunity to witness it firsthand. Fencing is included as a formal competition item in the World Games. From July 30th to August 12th, for more than ten days, fencing competitions were held daily in the Engineering Palace, attracting a large number of curious spectators. The Engineering Palace was bustling with activity, with a heavy flow of traffic.</p>
<p>When the reporter entered the venue on the day of the fencing finals, it was during the rest period. I saw two contestants wearing connected white canvas clothing and trousers, practicing various stances. They wore white running shoes and white wire mesh helmets on their faces, looking like mummies displayed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo from afar. Each person carried a sword more than two feet long in their hands (with a triple-pointed head) and waited for the duel on a rubber carpet about 20 feet long. On the referee's stand beside the venue sat soldiers in army uniforms, exuding heroic spirit, wearing badges with crossed swords. Outside the venue on both sides stood the contestants who had not yet entered the arena, each with a radiant spirit and a fierce aura. The clothing of the contestants, including the chest, abdomen, and two sleeves, had electrical wires connected to a main plug in the buttocks behind the back. When the competition started, a retractable elastic transverse electrical wire, like a tape measure, was pulled out from a movable rotating machine next to the venue and inserted into the main plug behind the contestants. The contestants could still stretch and move freely without any hindrance during the competition. This electrical wire also connected to another electrical recording machine. Because fencing competitions involve rapid movements, making it difficult for the referee to distinguish whose sword tip touched the opponent first, even though the outcome was divided, this new electric testing machine overcame this difficulty.</p>
<p>The French fencing team and Italy were competing for the final championship. These are two ancient and eccentric countries in Europe, so the contestants in the arena were all "of great origin." Their ancestors were all skilled swordsmen in history, so the two teams were evenly matched. The movements of the contestants were agile, and the sword lights reflected, making it dizzying. The audience was always immersed in a tense and exciting atmosphere. The Italian team took the lead, with a powerful momentum, winning five consecutive victories out of six people. However, the ten French contestants who responded were also veterans who had been on the battlefield for a long time, so they were able to display their heroic might and defeat the Italian team, leaving no survivors, and finally won the final victory with a score of eleven to five.</p>

<h3>The Competition in News Reporting</h3>
<p>— Cang</p>
<p>After the victory, there is a common feeling in the news industry circle, that is, the competition in news reporting has become white-hot. Field reporters tighten their nerves every day, trying to discover a unique piece of news to please their readers. Therefore, even if they are extremely sincere colleagues in private, they will inevitably become selfish when they enter the news circle of short-term competition. In order to compete for a piece of news, everyone intrigues and competes, which can lead to heated arguments and an unpleasant and awkward situation.</p>
<p>However, as early as thirty or forty years ago, the competition in news reporting in the local newspaper industry in Chicago in the United States was even more of a ferocious and vicious report with its claws and fangs! A newspaper often placed spies in the offices and machine rooms of its rival newspapers to sabotage the progress of the other party's work at any time. Sometimes, in order to surprise and win, they even kidnapped the other party's field reporters. The newspaper's old staff told reporters: Unique news is the red blood cell in the newspaper's sales volume. In order to win unique news, reporters should not hesitate to take any risks or commit any crimes; after discovering unique news, they should try to prevent other colleagues from obtaining it.</p>
<p>At that time, Walter Crowford Howcy was considered the most cunning and resourceful reporter in the Chicago newspaper industry. Before the age of twenty, Howey had already taken over as the editor of a newspaper. The news of the death of US President McKinley in 1901 was his masterpiece of unique acquisition. Originally, McKinley had been assassinated in the Falu area and had been lingering between life and death for a week. Howey predicted that he would die, so he wrote the news of President McKinley's death in advance, and also collected all the biographical history of Vice President Roosevelt, who succeeded McKinley, and arranged the layout. On the one hand, he also contacted the servants in the McKinley's house. As soon as McKinley died, whoever called him first to notify him would be given a reward of ten yuan. Therefore, within a few minutes of McKinley's death, Howey's newspaper was flying all over the street.</p>
<p>Howey is now also included in the list of famous Americans. People call him an editor and inventor. To date, he owns seventeen patents. Howey believes that to discover good news, it is most reliable to do it yourself. For example, one day, two car brokers and a sedan suddenly disappeared. A moment before the disappearance, the two car brokers drove a sedan to show the potential customer Churchill a sample. And now Churchill has also disappeared. This is an ordinary small piece of news.</p>
<p>When the police's attention was focused on the missing brokers, Howey paid attention to the whereabouts of the customer Churchill. He first found Churchill's hometown and called the local postmaster, who said: "That's right, Churchill just drove a new car home a few days ago. He is doing well in the big city. Everyone feels very honored." After Howey got this clue, he prepared two cars, one loaded with text and photography reporters, and the other loaded with three private detectives he hired. Arriving at the destination, the private detectives he hired caught Churchill, who stole the car, and rushed back to Chicago. Unexpectedly, another newspaper also got a clue, so it also mobilized a group of text and photography reporters, trying to intercept Howey and his party halfway and find a way to rob Churchill. If they really couldn't rob him, they would first take a photo and rush back to develop and print it, so they could get the scoop. Little did they know that Howey had also anticipated this move from the other newspaper and had made preparations in advance. The two groups encountered each other in a small town. After the pursuers followed step by step, they felt unable to rob Churchill, and finally followed him to a hotel. They saw two of Howey's private detectives handcuffing a person in the middle, so they grabbed a man's head without caring about the consequences, and drove back to the newspaper office at lightning speed. This joy was extraordinary, and they fully believed that they had grabbed a unique photo and news. Unexpectedly, when the photos were developed and identified, the person held by the detectives was clearly a reporter under Howey's command, resulting in a ridiculous situation! In fact, Howey had already arranged to lure the tiger away from the mountain and hid Churchill in another hotel, using a hidden tape recorder to obtain Churchill's full confession of murdering the car brokers. The next day, Howey's newspaper bragged again, saying: "This newspaper often takes exposing secret crimes as its consistent purpose, and this morning exclusively published the full and detailed confession of the murderer Churchill..."</p>
<p>But it would not be entirely true to point out that Howey is a person who specializes in playing tricks. At the very least, his wit, calmness, and various characteristics of his ability to discover his subordinates are enough to make him successful in any career. In addition, Howey is also a person who understands human relationships. Once, a poor little girl wrote a letter to Howey, begging him to take pity and find a house for her to live in. Howey used the most moving language and photos to publicize the little girl's life story in the newspaper every day. Finally, the old boss of a newspaper couldn't bear it anymore and immediately remitted 10,000 yuan to Howey, saying in a telegram: "Hurry up and buy a house for that girl, you have really hurt my heart!" The Guangzhou branch of the International Fourth Cultural Association recently published a small advertisement that read: "Do you feel troubled? Please learn the 'Gil Touberg' dance, and you can drive away your worries."</p>
<h3>The Best Way to Relieve Worries</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>Indeed, the way to relieve worries is to enjoy yourself. And you must enjoy yourself in time. Extrapolating from this, if you think of watching a movie, going to a restaurant, or traveling with friends, etc., you must go immediately. Because in the busy lives of most people, it is very difficult to find a suitable time to enjoy yourself. You must get rid of work, have money in your pocket, be healthy, and have a strong interest before entertainment can be interesting. And when you think of entertainment, the objective situation must be closest to the above conditions. To give an example, you will never go to a restaurant to have a big meal when you have a toothache or happen to be short of money.</p>
<p>Secondly, in my opinion, entertainment should not be planned by selecting a location or date. Someone travels a long distance from one end of the city, takes a rickshaw, and rushes to a certain theater at the other end to see a play, only to find that it is sold out. Their frustration is beyond description. It would be better to stroll on the street and buy a ticket to sit in a theater that is not sold out and is showing a good play.</p>
<p>As for pre-arranged travel dates, it is often difficult to achieve your wishes or get satisfactory results due to unexpected personnel circumstances, unpredictable diseases, or even bad weather. The most interesting thing is that a miscellaneous news column in a certain issue of Time magazine stated that the meteorological society in a certain place in the United States determined that the weather would be clear on a certain day and invited local members to have a picnic in the suburbs. On that day, it happened to rain heavily, which not only disappointed the members who attended but also damaged the reputation of the meteorological society.</p>
<p>The author is not a passive advocate of "life is like a dream, how much joy can there be," nor is he a believer in the decadent justice of the so-called "end of the century." However, life needs work, but it also needs entertainment, especially when you are frustrated and worried, you need to use entertainment to refresh your spirits. A Western proverb says: "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Although the wording is opposite, the meaning is the same.</p>
<h3>Modern Book Collectors</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Before discussing modern book collectors, I must, reluctantly, play the role of a "literary plagiarist" and first copy a passage from Hong Liangji's "Northern River Poetry Talks" as an introduction. He said, "There are several types of book collectors: the first is one who, upon obtaining a book, invariably delves into its origins and corrects its errors; these are called collators. Examples include Qian Shaozhan Daxin and Dai Jishi Zhen. The second is one who distinguishes its printing blocks and annotates its mistakes; these are called proofreaders. Examples include Academician Lu Wenchao and Grand Secretary Weng Fanggang. The third is one who searches for variant editions, ascending to replenish what was lost from the Stone Chamber and Golden Cabinet, and descending to provide materials for scholars and doctors to peruse; these are called collectors. Examples include the Tianyi Pavilion of the Fan family in Yin County, the Flower Vase of the Wu family in Qiantang, and the Zhuanshi Building of the Xu family in Kunshan. The fourth is one who seeks only fine editions, particularly Song imprints; though the author's intentions may not be fully grasped, the years of printing are most thoroughly understood; these are called connoisseurs. Examples include Chief Clerk Huang Pilie of Wu Prefecture and Recluse Bao Tingbo of Qiu Town. The fifth is one who buys books cheaply from declining old families and sells them at a good price to wealthy book lovers; with discerning eyes and knowledge of ancient and modern books, no Fujian or Sichuan edition can deceive them, and Song and Yuan imprints are immediately recognized; these are called purveyors. Examples include Qian Jingkai and Tao Wuliu of Wu Prefecture, and Shi Hanying and other book dealers of Huzhou."</p>
<p>Today, the value of Huang Yaopu's collated and annotated editions far exceeds gold. However, Mr. Hong merely calls him a connoisseur. Purveyors like Tao Wuliu are now hard to find. Zhang Shizhai's "comprehensive understanding" is even harder to achieve. Book collectors of the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras all read their collections, or at least could "distinguish the genuine from the spurious and know the ancient and modern." What about today's book collectors? Many are true book collectors, collecting without reading. A wealthy merchant, having made some money, pretends to be refined, buying the Hundred-Patched Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories and the Four Series Collection on white paper, neatly arranging them in a bookcase, with uniform spines, always untouched and as good as new. Thus, no one asks about other books, and the Twenty-Four Histories and the Four Series Collection still have a market.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Tao Lanquan specialized in collecting books on Kaihua paper, even managing to buy a Kaihua paper edition of the Seventeen Histories from the Jigu Pavilion, earning him the nickname "Tao Kaihua."</p>
<p>Fu Yuanshu and Luo Zhenyu were certainly the greatest book collectors of the Republic of China, and Yuanshu could be called a proofreader. Both Fu and Luo published many books, and all were exquisitely done. However, Yuanshu's later years were marked by decline, and his collection was partly donated and partly sold to the public. He also collected and traded books, with exceptional vision. The booksellers of Beiping all dreaded him. Fu and Luo were traitors, and their collections were likely scattered after their deaths.</p>
<p>Two booksellers in the north are worth mentioning: Wang Wenjin of Wenlu Hall and Sun Dianqi of Tongxue Studio. They had a deep understanding of bibliography and edition studies, going beyond mere "comprehensive understanding." Although not book collectors, they were certainly in the same vein as Tao Wuliu and Qian Congmo. They were much better than those who hoard books, never read them, and treat them as commodities. In Changshu, there is a book collector whose two sons even split up their father's collected works, each taking half of each book. Such a jarring thing can be considered a strange phenomenon among book collectors.</p>
<h3>Random Musings on Pen Names</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>The term "pen name" comes from abroad. In ancient China, we only had aliases, as seen in historical records. For example, the "Strategies of the Warring States" mentions Qin State's Huili Zi, which Gao You annotated as "there is a large Kui tree in his village, hence the alias Huili Zi." However, according to Zheng Qiao's "General Treatise," "Huili" is a place name. The "Strategies of the Warring States" also mentions Qin's recluse Hanquan Zi, which is a genuine alias. However, neither had any writings, so they cannot be said to be using pen names.</p>
<p>Pen names, in China, are called "temporary names." The earliest people to receive prizes for their writing were probably the poets of the Yuequan Poetry Society in the late Song and early Yuan dynasties. The champion, "Luo Gongfu," was actually Lian Wenfeng. The runner-up was "Qingshan Baiyun Ren" (Person of Green Mountains and White Clouds). Others included "Xiancun Ren" (Person of Immortal Village), "Shizi Gengfu" (Literate Ploughman), and "Qiniu Weng" (Ox-Riding Old Man). These were all true pen names. The prizes at the time were quite generous: the champion Luo Gongfu received "seven zhang of silk, five sticks of pens, and five ingots of ink."</p>
<p>The strangest pen name must be that of the ancient Bada Shanren (Eight Great Mountain Man): "Niu Shi Hui." These three characters together are difficult to understand; however, when written in cursive script, they become "Sheng Bu Bai Jun" (Born Not to Bow to a Ruler)! Bada Shanren was a member of the Ming imperial family who became a monk after the fall of the dynasty. Inscribing this pen name was truly shedding tears of blood. My late friend Master Hongyi had countless pen names. In his later years, he styled himself "Yi Yi Yi Laoren" (Old Man One One One), which some mistook as him emulating the Six One Layman. However, if one reads his "Dream Shadows of Ten Years in Southern Fujian," one would know that he took two "one" characters from the ancient poem "One thing not accomplished, man gradually ages" and Wu Meicun's deathbed poem "One penny not worth, what is there to say," thus becoming "Er Yi Laoren" (Old Man Two One)! This is so startling!</p>
<h3>Ma Sicong Has Arrived</h3>
<p>— Tingyou</p>
<p>Listeners who frequently turn on their radios are all amazed by the recent flourishing of music in Shanghai. At first glance, this phenomenon is of course gratifying, but upon closer reflection, the reality is also quite sad: the public's interest is so strong, yet musical performances are so rare, so they can only turn to the limited number of records to temporarily satisfy their hunger. Most radio programs consist of a very limited number of classical music records, which are played day and night, and their sound has long lost its brilliance. Nevertheless, there are many who are infatuated with these records, as employees of radio stations are well aware.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Ma Sicong has arrived. This is great news after Ma Sihu's departure to the United States. This has aroused the excitement of many people.</p>
<p>To call Ma Sicong the Chinese Kreisler, I think, is not an exaggeration. His violin technique may not be as good as Kreisler's, but he is good at absorbing the essence of folk music for composition, which is similar to Kreisler, and his achievements are even better than Kreisler's.</p>
<p>What makes people hard to forget Ma Siting is not only his "string skills," but also his willingness to practice without blindly believing in his own imagination, absorbing the melodic essence of folk songs from Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and other places, and changing the traditional harmony rules to express the local customs and human feelings of the people of this country. I can never forget the homesickness song in Ma's work "Suiyuan Suite." No matter how Ma Sicong played it, the beauty and uniqueness of the violin music of the Chinese folk song style does not need to be described by my clumsy writing.</p>
<p>Although singing folk songs is popular recently, it is rare to see folk songs being infused into music, and there is no second person who has achieved as much as Ma Sicong. However, the work of developing the "National Music School" must be based on solid basic skills and rich cultivation. Therefore, while praising Ma Sicong, the main thing is to pay attention to first improving the technical level of general music learners and building a solid foundation, so there is no need to desperately make a fuss about slogans. Music should certainly belong to the people, but desperately posting slogans of "people's music" will definitely not help the actual situation!</p>
<h3>Discussions on Names and Surnames</h3>
<p>The Old Capital Daily reported that the Chief of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, "Leppham," has officially changed his Chinese translation name to "Lai Puhan." According to this name, there is not much difference in sound, and "Lai" is a Chinese surname, which is more suitable for the Chinese style than the former. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese style of names and surnames is attracting attention and interest from foreigners.</p>
<p>This mood seems to be initiated by England, and the current British Prime Minister "Attlee" was originally translated as "Ateli," and then at the suggestion of the British side was changed to the surname "Ai." Also, the British envoy to China in the early Republic of China, "Zhu Erdian," was originally the most crowning Chinese name. At that time, the President's Office was the official "Huang Kaiwen," and Zhu was very happy at the same time.</p>
<p>"Ai" and "Lai" are both in the same rhyme, which is especially coincidental. Although these two surnames are not very uncommon, there are not many historical celebrities. Most of the Chinese surnames are based on the ancient feudal system or official positions. The Lai surname is because there was a Lai country in the Spring and Autumn period, and the Ai surname is because the Qi doctor had an Ai Kong. As for later generations, there was Ai Yu in the Song Dynasty, who served as the Sima Nong; and Ai Xuan, an artist who was good at painting flowers, bamboos, and birds; Lai Fei in the Tang Dynasty, a literary scholar; Lai Wenjin in the Song Dynasty, a geographical expert. As for the former Qing Dynasty Yongzheng and Jiaqing dynasties, there was a Hanlin scholar each, and there were two Hanlin scholars in the Guangxu years.</p>
<p>The British first Ambassador to China, "Jia Degan," is similar to the Prime Minister of the State Council "Jia Deyao" during the old Duan Zhizheng era. "Xu Gesen," who was injured by Japanese planes in a car in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, has the same surname as Xu Shiying (Xu was also the Prime Minister of Duan at the time).</p>
<p>The surname of the British Prime Minister during the war, "Churchill," was originally "Qiu" in Chinese history. Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty, in order to avoid the taboo of Confucius, specially instructed that the character "　" should be added to all place names and surnames, making it "邱," and must be read "qi," so place names such as "Zhang邱," "Shang邱," and "Ren邱" were all added ㄎ, but people still read "Qiu" in their mouths, and no one was forbidden. If the "Qiu" of "Churchill" is read "qi" according to the sound limit set by Yongzheng, it will be far from the original sound.</p>

<h3>Reader Consulting, Legal Interpretation: Three Tenants Imprisoned for Drug Use, Second Landlord Takes the Opportunity to Terminate the Lease</h3>
<p>Zhu Jinbao asked his friend Jia for Wan Shen for many years. One of his tenants, Wang, was sentenced by the court to one and a half years in prison for drug use. Since Wang was imprisoned, the room he lived in has been locked and no one is responsible for the rent. Now Jia wants to take back the room for his own use, but he has several questions. Please answer as follows: (1) In the above situation, if the landlord wants to take the house back for his own use, what are the procedures? (2) Should he first declare it to the Baojia office or file a case with the police station? (3) Can the furniture in the house be sold to offset the rent? (4) Should the tenant be notified or consulted in prison? What if he does not agree to the sale? (5) When carrying out the furniture change fee and taking back the house, how should it be proved and filed? (6) How to deal with a third party who wants to obstruct it for no reason?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin's reply] (1) He may sue the court to order the termination of the contract. (2) It is also feasible to have the head of the jia and the police officer read to the scene to prove that the house has been taken back. (3) You can refer to the provisions of Article 445, paragraph 2 of the Civil Law. You should send a letter to notify him that if you do not agree, you can apply to the court for auction. (5) It is most appropriate to sue the court for auction of the retained items and order the termination of the contract and the delivery of the house. (6) If a third party illegally interferes, he can report to the police to stop it or sue it.</p>
<h3>Poor Daughter Wishes to Give Away Her Children for Adoption</h3>
<p>Huang Yuqing, a woman from Yong, is 25 years old. When she was 17 years old, she lived with a platoon leader and had a son and a daughter. The daughter is eight years old, and the son is still in diapers and in good shape. When Ms. Huang lived together, she did not know that her hometown in Lu Province was already full of children. After the incident, Ms. Huang was abandoned. She now lives on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, in this city. Because she has no means of making a living, she will become a starving prisoner. If any reader is willing to adopt her children and raise them to adulthood, it will be a great deed of merit. She herself is willing to work as a maid in order to make a living.
