<h3>新閣全體名單決定　今提中政會通過後公布　徐永昌將出任國防部長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕孫科內閣之全體閣負名單，決提交廿二日上午十時舉行之國民黨中政會通過後公布。該項名單原定廿一日交中政會者，惟以孫氏原擬名單人選尙有少數人士未作最後決定，廿一日竟日續與各方洽商後，始全部確定，至原定廿二日樂行之新政院首次會議，亦改由翁內閣主持最後一次例會。又廿二日晨舉行中政會以前，將首先舉行中常會，對政院副院長吳鐵城案予以通過，中政·中常兩會議，均將由總裁親自主持。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕孫內閣全體閣員名單之最後決定，經探悉大致如次：外交吳鐵城兼，內政洪蘭友，工商劉維熾，財政徐堪，主計龐松舟，糧食關吉玉，水利鍾天心，社會谷正綱，交通俞大維，地政吳尙鷹，敎育李蒸，國防徐永昌，衛生林可勝，司法行政梅汝璈，農林左舜生，資委會孫越崎，蒙藏白雲梯，僑務陳策，政委張羣，張治中，翁文灝，陳立夫，張厲生，另由靑年黨提出一名人選未定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕今晚合衆社所發某決策要人談話之電，其中涉及新內閣和戰政策之取決及政府最高首長之進退等，詢諸此間官方，均無肯定答覆。對於該電所稱新閣所謂和平並非投降，且將在軍事·外交·政治上發奮圖强及邀請關係國調停一節，亦無所聞。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿一日電〕行政院長孫科同時宣布成立戰時內閣及其願意與中共談判「光榮和平」事，或曾得蔣總統之首肯，蓋以前關於和平之一切談論，均被列為顚覆性行動，有受嚴懲之處。統計對此項宣布之反應，廿一晨尙嫌過早。但以美官方及國民黨內自由份子而言，此項宣布諒將博得最大之讃許。</p>
<h3>津戰火漸近城垣　重點在北郊槍砲聲緊密　平郊僅有小股匪軍竄擾</h3>
<p>〔本報天律廿一日電〕津外圍戰事漸次逼近城防工事，津北宜興埠·丁字沽，津東東局子，津南灰堆·白塘口，津西楊柳靑各鄉均有戰事，市內各路口戰鬥工事頃已普遍完成，進入固守態勢。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿一日電〕津週邊戰火重點仍在津北，廿一日晨四時至十時許，砲聲緊密，並夾維槍聲，不斷傳入市內。據軍方發表：廿一日晨國軍已主動出擊，廿日晚匪千餘犯津北宜興埠·柳灘·丁字沽等地，經國軍砲轟，匪稍退，國軍於廿一日拂曉對匪展開衝擊，午間仍對峙中。〔又電〕津北宜興埠·柳灘·丁字沽之綫，廿一日下午又展開激戰，匪猛衝五六次，均被擊退，入晚砲聲更緊。又據軍息：津南減河廿日晚發現匪六十二·六十三兩旅及地方團隊二千，架橋偷渡，經小站國軍猛烈射擊，匪傷亡六七百人。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿一日電〕據悉：國軍强大海軍陸戰隊廿一日已到達塘沽陸，惟未獲正面證實。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿一日電〕津市外圍廿一日晨四時砲聲大作，並有斷續之機槍聲，至九時後漸趨沉寂。據警備部公佈：津周邊我强大兵團，廿一日開始主動向匪展開戰鬥，晨間槍砲聲卽我開始行動之序幕。某部隊長稱：國軍已作萬全部署，將予匪以致命打擊。津西方面，楊柳靑我軍廿日擊潰匪二千餘人後，匪第七十二師約二千餘，廿日傍晚又由永淸·安次竄抵天津縣屬大柳灘，於楊柳靑附近作試探性偷襲，刻在激戰中。津北匪主力一股，自十八日猛犯市西北週邊地區，天齊廟宜興埠一帶，該地區某强大兵團副司令官兼軍長林偉儔將軍親臨前綫指揮，並激勵全體官兵，誓與陣地共存亡，士氣極盛，當予犯匪以迎頭痛擊，激戰三晝夜，匪已潰退，俘獲甚夥，詳細戰果在調查中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕平西南城郊昨夜今晨有激烈戰事，槍砲聲全城可聞。昨下午九時半後，林彪匪部第五縱隊，自廣安門外大井一帶，分兩股於夜色朦朧中竄犯，一股經跑馬塲。運花池一帶滲入西便門外白雲觀，元寗寺以西地區，另股突入廣安門外達批營，距廣安門僅三數華里，當卽與國軍發生激戰，國軍步砲配合，以猛烈砲火轟擊達一小時，匪受挫向財神廟一帶潰退，廣安門外馬路兩側遺屍纍纍，南郊昨晚同時亦有小股匪軍在廣渠門外至永定門外地區竄擾，被國軍擊退。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕平郊戰事今較緩和。二十日下午九時，平西南駱駝灣·魏牆角·蓮花池附近發現小股匪軍，經國軍兜剿，激戰二小時，匪不支向西南退去，斃匪三千餘。廿一日午，平西公主墳，祟興寺之間，有小股匪活動，國軍步砲協同予以截擊，戰鬥一小時半，斃匪二百五十餘，該匪向公主墳以西退去，午後平郊平靜。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿一日電〕北平在共軍包圍中已成勇敢而不安之都市。城內居民二百餘萬人，正坐以待變，戰火將於何時自郊外蔓延至城內，目前尙無法預測。城內到處見有軍營，許多胡同置有砲位，汽車無法通行。警察局及政府文武機關門前則均滿堆沙袋，守城兵士密切注意城外共軍動態，一俟敵人進前，卽發砲轟擊。北平每夜十時起卽告戒嚴，因此居民已無社交生活。留平外僑約分兩類，一類焦慮未來局勢，茫然不知所措；一類對於當前局勢故作鎭靜，或眞正無動於中。各大旅社內旅客寥寥，其凄凉之狀，有如陵墓。平津間之平常電話在星期六已告中斷，惟電報則仍照常。</p>
<h3>徐永昌一度赴平</h3>
<p>命與傅作義會晤</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕此間獲悉：徐永昌曾監命來平，與傳作義會晤，十九日深夜返京，向蔣總統有所報告</p>
<h3>美僑留戀故都　無人申請撤退</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿一日電〕北平美僑不顧未來局勢演變如何，目前仍未有申請撤退者。此閱一帶美僑原有七百另八人，現留此者尙有二百五十五人，其中有八十七人係美國領事館與經濟合作總署職員及其眷屬，此外則為語言學校學生等，美國軍事方面高級官負三人及外國記者四人，前晉相偕自南京來平遊歷，現亦被迫留此，無法回去。北平美領事館轄境內美僑尙有十三人，自願留於轄境，其中在通縣者兩名，在北平西北郊燕京，淸華大學區內者亦有數名。今晨四時三十分又在協和醫院中出生一美僑，其人係美國務院在平所辦華文學校主任沙倫貝傑之次子，重七磅。</p>
<h3>北平五千軍民　趕築壇機塲</h3>
<p>津新機塲試降成功</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿一日電〕天壇機塲正於五千名軍民協力趕築中，現塲週邊樹木業已伐竣，地面正由消防隊洒水，並用巨刑鏟平機及車碾壓墊中。據修建負責人稱：此機塲修竣後，較東單機塲大約三倍，可與西郊南苑機塲相媲美，巨型機降落均無問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿一日電〕據悉津市新機塲廿一日已有C47型飛機一架試降成功，此間民航隊人員已向滬方聯絡派機來津。</p>
<h3>平市積極推進　戰時行政工作　組協軍自衛團楚溪春任團長　省市府經常工作暫停</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕北平戰時行政工作積極展開，華北剿總，冀省政府，平市政府已合組北平協軍自衛工作團，負責推進維持秩序，軍民合作，動員民衆，淸匪除奸，由楚溪春擔任團長，下設指導小組，由于緘齊，程厚之，楊淸植，田竹生，高蘭波，韓達，六人組成，此小組外，更分四組辦公，卽社秩序組，民衆訓練組，宣傳慰勞組，軍民合作組，各區將設分團警察分局長任分團長，區長任分團副團長，各保亦設工作小組省府市府經常工作大部暫告停止，正集中人力，加强基層機構，配合作戰。</p>
<h3>立法院正副院長　可能於後日改選　秘書長張肇元等提辭呈</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕孫科宣布其新閣組成後，立院之最初反應，卽為正副院長之改選問題，因院長孫科，副院長陳立夫均已參加內閣，傳說中可能為立院院長之吳鐵城，亦已出任政院副院長，故正副院長均須改選，惟以陳立夫入閣尙未見諸明令，故廿一日立院遂未議及改選事宜，惟衆料改選工作可能於廿四日舉行。廿一日為立院例會之期，晨間立委出席者甚為踴躍，會塲中接觸頻繁，十二時立院之新政俱樂部一四座談會，民主自由社團體在華僑招待所開聯席會，交換有關正副院長人選之意見，吳鐵城亦曾參加，會中並舉行假投票，就院長人選加以測騐，結果童冠賢獲票最多，王普涵次之，聞該三團體將以此次測騐投票為依歸。另一部份團體如革新俱樂部，諍友社·中社等，晚間亦曾交換意見，革新俱樂部並舉行幹事會，決定支持程天放競選院長。此外，對李蒸·齊世英·劉文島·鄒樹文等亦表示支持，並定廿二日午開會員大會，徵求全體意見。革新俱樂部之決定，聞將獲得諍友社及中社之支持，至過去一部份立委擬推舉顏惠慶出任院長說，因顏年邁體弱，難以當此重任，副院長原有推舉劉健羣之擬議，但亦未能護得全體一致之同意，故立院正副院長之改選，現均無法確切推斷究屬何人。又立院秘書長張肇元，副秘書長延國符及秘書處主要職員，均已向孫院長提出辭呈，惟孫氏尙未批示。</p>
<h3>國內旅客携帶金銀外幣　立院請制止沒收　並劃貴州為食鹽特銷區</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕立院第二會期第卅次會議廿一日舉行，陳立夫主席，晨間宣讀上次會議錄後，報告事項均經通過，其中包括總統咨為全國各省市宣告戒嚴，請查照案，行政院電請審議管理外匯條例草案案，戡亂軍律草案案，鹽稅計征條例草案案等。旋開始討論，上午通過二案，一為討論多日之修正社會部組織法草案案，癥結原在該法第四條之組織，各委員意見甚多，然表決時，仍照審查意見通過·另一為地方政府及所屬機關主計機構及人員設置條例草案案，十二時散會。午後續會，復通過交部葫蘆島港務局組織條例案，廢止輔幣條例案，有關綏區土地處理條例及綏區土地債券等三案，公營事業工會法案，中央國術館改國立交敎文委會審查案，國際電信公約案，華僑回國興辦實業獎勵法案，制定最低工資標凖，以維勞工生活案，咨請行政院迅予加强地方自衛力量，擴編各省保安團隊案，起用在鄉軍人及轉業軍官，加强戡亂力量案，停止適用選舉法規內有關公職候選人檢　部份案及為貴州鹽價暴漲，影響民生，請劃貴州為食鹽特銷區，以救民命案等，最後通過臨時動議二件，（一）張慶楨等提，擬請行政院迅速令飭財政部，制止海關人員擅自沒收國內旅客金銀外幣，以符政令，而利行旅案，經討論後，為爭取時間，俾迅速制止此一不合法之沒收起見，決改為質詢案，向政院提出，並希望於下次會議時獲有結果，提出報告。（二）王澤民等提議，於本會期休會後，凡回籍之立法委員，應協助地方政府組訓民衆，加强自衛武力案，經討論結果，決定交國防委會審查後，再提大會討論。至六時半散會。</p>
<h3>鹽稅計征條例草案</h3>
<p>立院交財金委會審查</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕鹽稅改制案，前經政院於四日通過改「從量征收」為「從價征收」之方案，經財部據以修改鹽政條例等有關條文後，已擬就鹽稅計征條例草案，咨請立院完成立法程序，立院廿一日例會時已提出報告，交由財政金融委會審查。據悉：鹽稅從價征收，按全國產銷各區重要地點之平均鹽價，减除原有稅額後之實需成本數，依下列百分率計征，甲·食鹽稅：（一）海鹽征百分之七十。（二）井鹽行銷貴州者，征百分之十五。（三）井鹽行銷貴州以外之其他地區者，征百分之四十·（四）池鹽銷陜西者，征百分之五。（五）池鹽行銷陝西以之其他地區者，征百分之六十（六）土鹽·靑鹽征百分之卅·乙漁鹽·用鹽稅，征百分之五。丙工業用鹽，農業用慶免稅，經特許輸出·輸入之鹽，除征關稅外，并征鹽稅，其稅率另定之，但財部得視國內之產銷情形，呈經政院核准，免其鹽稅，此項辦法其目的在於均衡鹽價，平均民負，鏟除暴利，防止囤積，配合物價，穩定銷市，傳確保庫收，供應戡亂。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕監察院廿一日發表熊在消，金越光二監委，對揚子建業公司囤積案之糾舉書，全文長約一萬二千字·緣十月份監院例會中，決議派員調查上海揚子建業公司囤積大量物資，旋經子院長指派熊在渭，金越光二委員赴滬實地調查，歷時僅二月。據熊金二委員調查結果，揚子公司囤有西藥，顏料，化裝品，玻璃質日用品等，共三四千箱，另有與揚子公司關係密切之利喊公司所存新小汽車七十五輛，卡車十輛，以現値從低値計，約合金圓券二千萬元以上。熊氏等認為該公司總經理孔令侃有仗勢逃稅，囤積居奇，非法牟利之嫌，揚子建業公司應受停業處分，其涉及司法部份，並應移送法院辦理。又兩監委認為上海市長吳國楨，警察局長俞叔平，經警大隊長程義寬，及上海市直接稅局局長黃祖培，輸出入管理委負會主委霍寶樹，江海關稅務司張勇年等，均有玩忽職務之處，亦經一併提出糾舉。該案業於廿一日晨，經監委劉延濤，王向辰，王澍霖三人審查成立，卽送政院辦理。監院頃發表糾舉書全文如次：</p>

<h3>社論　抗議武裝日本！</h3>
<p>美國加緊武裝日本軍隊的消息，最近不斷傳來。美當局不僅不予否認，且表示具有深切興趣。我國地勢毗鄰日本，七十年來深感侵略的苦痛，倘使日本軍國主羲一旦復活，對於我國的威脅是很重大的，因此，我們基於民族安全感的立塲，以及同盟國管制日本的立塲，對於美國加緊武裝日本這件事，應提出嚴重的抗議！</p>
<p>日本自投降三年以來，在美國單獨管制之下，舊勢力已經逐漸復興與抬頭·關於日本武裝問題，過去曾有海上保安廳的設立，及十二萬五千武裝警察的恢復。我國輿論抗議設立保安廳，認為這等於海軍省的恢復，美當局和盟總則說：保安廳係一緝私組織，並無武裝配備；我國輿論抗勝恢復十二萬五千日警，並舉第一次大戰後德國十萬警察重建納粹軍隊為例，喚起美國和盟總的高度警覺，而美當局和盟總則說，日本為保衛治安鎭壓反動，需要有此自衛力量。遠東委員會開會，同盟國紛紛抗議武裝日本，美代表一概否認；東京的對日盟管會，祗准聆聽麥帥「和平日本」的訓詞，不許提出「武裝日本」的質問。實際上，這個旣成事實巳經存在，並且在繼續的發展中，除日本人以外，幾無人相信美國武裝日本並非事實。</p>
<p>最近以來，由於美國遠東政策的偏差，積極扶日之說又甚囂塵上。在言論上，美國官方乃至輿論界，公開支持日本的復興，甚至有人相信日本的抬頭，甚有裨益未來的遠東局勢。在行動上，美當局對於日本的武裝，不僅表現在經濟上，思想上，並且表現在政治上，使衰退中的軍國主義又逐漸復興起來·據合衆社本月十三日華盛頓消息；美國正考慮在日本建立十萬至十五萬的武裝警察軍隊，以使日本在佔領軍撤退後，不致成為眞空地區。美國政府高級官員二十日公開表示尖銳的興趣，並指出此項建議為麥帥前駐日助手艾契堡所倡導，自然為麥帥所支持的一種建議。外交官相信，日本人口共有八千萬人，艾契堡僅主張十五萬名武裝軍隊，數目不可謂大。現在美國所恐懼者，即此一建議提出遠東委員會時必遭蘇聯之堅强反對。實則，這一威脅遠東安全的計劃，違反波茨坦宣言和遠東委員會對日基本方針的計劃，除了美國以外，恐將為遠東委員會任何一國所反對。</p>
<p>波茨坦宣言及遠東委員會決議，乃盟國管制日本的最高方針；未來的對日和會，亦將以此要義為締的的準繩。東京的盟總，本為遠東委員會執行佔領與管制的機構，可是三年以來的盟總，其佔領與管制政策的執行，完全為一國的意識，一國的國防所決定，並非眞正執行遠東委員會的決議。所以說，今天盟總管制日本政策的錯誤，完全是美國遠東政策偏差的結果。艾契堡為麥帥的日本智囊，當他在日服務時，或因受了日本人迷湯麻醉之故，儘量支持日本經濟武裝思想武裝，現在他回任國務院，竟向政府提出武裝日是本十五萬軍隊的建議，可能將為政府所接受，並且可能於旣成事實造成後，提付遠東委員會强使承認。我們認為這種違反波茨坦宣言威脅遠東和平的措施，是萬分不合理的。我國基於民族安全感的立塲，應該反對這一意孤行的措施。我國基於同盟國負有管制日本責任的立塲，應該尋求外交途徑糾正艾契堡建議的錯誤。無論如何，我們對於美國武裝日本這件事，是不容緘默的。行將成立的孫內閣，不知外交當局對此將有何種作為？</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿一日電〕印尼發言人今日稱，據新加坡方面消息，印尼軍隊已克復京城日惹，城內已發生激戰，荷蘭傘兵五十二名被殺。此項消息得之於州印尼秘密電台。同時，海牙方面荷蘭軍事發言人認為此種消息虛偽。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕紐約時報今日載稱，據可靠消息，印尼流亡政府將於今日宣佈成立，地點可能在印度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺廿一日電〕散佈世界各地之印尼共和國人士今日互相聯絡。傳說馬尼刺將成為流亡政府所在，但印尼人士認為尙早。印尼駐東南亞洲商務委員薩羅沙與荷蘭駐菲公使陶桑特今日均訪問菲外次尼里長談。聞菲總統季里諾即將對印尼局勢發表聲明。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿一日電〕荷方今日宣布，荷軍沿印尼各交通綫推進，已佔據印尼第二大城沙拉卡泰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海牙廿一日電〕荷蘭軍事發言人今日稱，荷軍完成對印尼之軍事行動及擊潰印尼游擊隊，大約需時六個月。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞二十日電〕荷軍司令部今日宣布，荷軍攻入印尼共和國進展順利，海軍睦戰隊自爪哇東海岸推進五十哩，已抵印尼唯一油源芝普附近。其他部隊佔據馬倫東南都里恩。另一支部隊在日惹西面推進三十二哩至波華勒多。蘇門答臘方面，荷軍已佔據索洛克與辛加卡克。各部隊分路向棉關挺進，沿途未遇重大抵抗。</p>
<h3>美將向安理會建議　令荷軍立即停戰　原主荷軍撤至原防未得各方同意</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿一日電〕安理會美國代表團發言人今日稱，美國已放棄要求荷軍退至攻擊印尼前界棧之計劃，僅將提議停戰，因安理會大多數代表不願支援命荷蘭撤軍之提議。據荷蘭發言人稱，荷軍在爪哇與蘇門答臘完成主要軍事行動後，或可接受停戰令，若欲撤退至舊界綫，則礙難實行，且將引起糾紛。</p>
<p>〔聯合社康白拉廿一日電〕澳洲總理契弗萊於今日內閣會議後宣稱，澳洲將要求聯合國安全理事會命印尼境內立卽停戰，並使荷軍退至進攻前之界綫。安理會可利用經濟或其他制裁方法促成印尼停戰。澳政府已命駐安理會代表與各國代表，特別是英美代表討論解決糾紛之進一步措施，如立卽在印尼舉行選舉及攷慮對卽尼實施託管制度等。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎二十日電〕安理會二十日循蘇聯外長莫洛托夫之親自要求，而延期考慮印尼戰事。莫氏係在莫斯科。美代表傑塞普為印尼戰事之爆發大感困擾，匆匆自尼斯病床飛抵此間出席預定二十日舉行之會議。渠稱，美政府對此項危機認為「十分嚴重」。傑氏請安理會主席蘭根霍夫向蘇聯「迫切呼籲」，請蘇聯代表馬立克如屬可能，於廿一日來此會議。經傑塞普與敘利亞代表柯里之要求，蘭氏同意令調解委會於廿二日會議前再提出關於印尼情勢之更多報導。傑氏解釋稱，司能難以迅速獲得報導，蓋調解委會美代表柯樞蘭現在巴達維亞，而比利時與澳洲之代表則在共和國區域內之加里朗，雙方音訊斷絕。先是美方發言人曾稱，美國曾提議請馬立克乘空運飛機飛離柏林，馬氏對此諒不致接受。蘇聯方面人士使人懷疑馬氏能否於二十二日下午及時抵此參加會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十日電〕荷蘭政府今日於聯合國安全理事蓄舉行緊急會議後向該會提出備忘錄，略謂，國際干涉印尼事件已無濟於事。荷蘭與印尼繼續談判亦無裨益，印尼共和國不能合作履行今年一月一日所訂設立印尼聯邦之協定，實屬咎由自取。</p>
<p>〔合衆社雪梨二十日電）聯合國印尼調解委員會主席澳洲聯邦法官柯勃二十日稱：安理會之迅速及有力行動，仍能結束目前正在印尼進行之衝突。</p>
<h3>阿盟要求安理會　制目荷軍事行動</h3>

<h3>印尼駐美公使要求美國　對荷蘭停止援助　在政治經濟上支持印尼</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕印尼共和國公使蘇米德羅今日向記者稱，印尼共和國政府決心對荷軍抗戰到底，新政府將在蘇門答臘波基丁傑成立。該地倘被佔據，再遷往別處。印尼共和國一日有領土，卽一日有政府，最後並可設立流亡政府。敢料荷軍卽將在山嶺區遭遇重大抵抗。美國為主持公道，應在政治經濟上支援印尼，不僅以調解為已足，應鄭重考慮斷絕馬歇爾計劃項下對荷闌之援助，並應支援印尼共和國打破兩年來荷蘭對印尼區域對外貿易之封鎖。</p>
<h3>傳澳籍調解員　在印尼失踪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿一日廣播吧城訊：謠傳荷印調解委員會澳籍代表突告失蹤。據稱，渠於十九日晨出外野宴後，行蹤不明，但因交通斷絕，無法證實·</p>
<h3>周以德經中國　喻印尼局勢</h3>
<p>美拒絕援華認為可笑</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕共和黨衆議員周以德，武一日單獨接見合衆社記者稱：印尼戰事不啻為整個遠東的炸藥。渠繼稱：「殖民戰爭將給予蘇聯以最好之宣傳武器，蘇聯宣傳家將握住民族主義的舊招牌，宣稱他們能使亞洲脫離白種人統治，獲得自由。在戰前，日本人曾高呼亞洲是亞洲人的亞洲，日本雖巳失敗，此種說素却深入許多亞洲人的腦海。雖然，日本的實在意思，不過是亞洲是日本人的亞洲，現在蘇聯的如法泡製，其眞實意義也不過是亞洲是蘇聯的亞洲，但亞洲人是不會覺察的，因為蘇聯比日本又聰明了百倍。」局以德並以印尼之局勢與中國相比。渠稱：美國拒絕以援助給予中劉政府，「但同時，在荷蘭對印尼發動戰爭之時。吾人却正以復興計劃的援助支持荷蘭，我並不是說吾人應將荷蘭摒出經濟復興計劃之外，但如吾人仍將支持與亞洲人作戰的歐洲人，而拒絕支持與中國人作戰的中國人，則將為一幅極有趣的對比。」</p>
<h3>荷蘭下議院　否決共黨動議</h3>
<p>對印尼仍取敵對態度</p>
<p>〔聯合社海牙廿一日電〕荷蘭下議院昨夜以八十八票對入票通過擁護狄里斯總理之對印尼政策，僅共產黨投反對票，共產蠶要求立卽停止數黝行動之動議因而失敗。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海牙二十日電〕荷　蘭總理狄里斯今日在戰會義告印尼問題畢，旁觀席上有人高呼「打　殖民戰爭，和平萬歲！」旋有三人被捕，旁臘者均被逐出。</p>
<h3>菲學生拒聽　荷鋼琴家演奏</h3>

<h3>蘇正式抨擊荷蘭　利用調解委會圈套毀印尼　圖以武力攤牌用心已久</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十日電〕莫斯科電台評論員李尼斯基今日指責荷蘭利用聯合國調解會之圈套，毀滅印尼共和國。據稱，該調解會由美·澳·比三國代表組成，表面上協助解決印尼問題及監督停戰，實際上作為外國干涉印尼之烟慕。由於該會之庇護，用支解及封鎖方法摧毀印尼之陰謀，因而成熟，該會實為陰謀會。荷蘭當局在進行談判時，其唯一目標在等待適當時機使之破裂，而造成公開戰鬥。荷蘭統治階級諉稱此次軍事行動出於不得已，事實上荷蘭軍時時凖備以武力攤牌。荷蘭並不利用停戰求取和平，而利用時機調兵遺將，並以美英軍火補充其武器。按安理會將於廿二日繼續討論印尼問題，屆時蘇聯將採取何種態度，可於上述言論見其一斑。</p>
<h3>美最高法院駁回上訴　東條等死期不遠　麥帥得隨時下令秘密執行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿一日電〕盟總官員廿一日宣稱：渠等認為東條及其同僚之執行，至少不致在廿四小時內舉行。消息靈通人士稱：麥帥在接獲美國最高法院拒絕干預戰犯審判之正式通知後，將立卽下令將東條及其他被處死刑之戰犯六人提付執行，一般認為：絞決可能在任何時間內宣佈。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿一日電〕麥帥今日與第八軍司令華克討論東條等戰犯七名執行絞刑日期及手續。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕美國最高法院今日以六票對一票，決定駁回日戰犯之上訴。判決理由書稱：「上訴人係由遠東軍事法庭判決，該法庭乃美國及現在佔領日本之各盟國所組成。麥帥乃被推選之盟軍統帥，軍事法庭之判決已由麥帥批准，在此情形之下，美國法庭無權檢討。承認。擱置或廢止此種判決，為此理由，各該上訴人援引人身保護法之要求，當予駁回。」日戰犯申請上訴者雖祗有廣田·土肥原·木戶·岡敬純·佐藤·島田及東鄉七名，但最高法院之判決，適用於廿五名日戰犯全體。各該犯仍將依遠東法庭原判，在麥帥監督下由美第八軍司令主持行刑。</p>
<h3>七犯遺囑　死後公布</h3>

<p>〔聯合社舊金山二十日電〕聯邦法庭今日對「東京玫瑰」東栗叛國案又起辦論。被告之律師柯林斯稱，被告巳受東京一度服滿徒刑，不能再加審訊。且東栗嫁與葡人達季諾，已成葡萄牙公民，美國法庭不得再加審判。政府方面律師狄華斐稱，審判前之拘禁不能生效，且東栗之犯罪在出嫁以前，故仍得由美國法庭審判</p>
<h3>義法兩國外長　談話範圍廣泛</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社岡納鎭廿日電〕義外長史福薩與法外長許曼今日在此間會談歷兩小時半，此與義國將來所取對西歐列强之態度頗有關係。談話甚為廣泛，包括完成法義關稅同盟·增加兩國貿易人力·並勘劃西尼斯山境法義界綫諸問題，凡自德國至巴勒斯坦之諸問題均將就國際觀察點加以檢討。聞史福蕯對於法國對德之立塲頗表贊同，但義國殊願與德國增加貿易。此間觀察家聲稱，兩國對諸問題意見之脗合，實由義國希望將來能獲法國贊助，得在國際會議中復佔一位置所致。</p>
<h3>英國政發表白皮書　宣布經濟新計劃　俾能於四年後自給自足</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二十日電〕英政府今日發表白皮書，宣佈英國爭取在一九五二年後經濟上足自給之四年計劃。該計劃曾於十月間呈歐洲經合總署審閱·計劃要點為（一）促進個別工人之生產率，以增加國家總生產；（二）消費維持目前水準；（三）輸入限於戰前水凖百分之八十，禁止市塲上奢侈品與半奢侈品之買賣，（四）以國家百分之廿五之收入，置於國內投資，（五）輸出應較一九四八年增加百分之五十。</p>

<h3>挽救目前工業處境困難　工貸辦法決定放寬　利息分別減低期限的酌予延長　機器工業申請收購從寬核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工貸辦法為優待工業界起見，在利息及期限上，已作相當修正央行貼放會昨日上午十一時，舉行第十九次會議，劉攻芸主席，首由林崇　報告生產事業緊急貸款辦法公佈後，關於收購成品部份，申請案件甚多，巳由審查會積極核議，經開會兩次，巳通過收購案多件，並組織收購成品評價委員會，聘請工業界各部門公正人士為委員，公平評定收購價格，分別委託承做行局照辦，進行頗為順利。至於質押貸款部份，雖經決定辦法，但困難尙多，阻碍實行，工業界方面以貸款利率較高，期限亦短，及承辦行局行莊顧慮風險，未能樂於承辦等問題，均須設法解決，以利實施。尤以機器工業處境最感困難，希望放寬尺度，格外殷切。當經到會各委員討論結果，僉認目前工業界慮境確甚困難，貸款辦法應予放寬辦理，以渡難關，機器業特感困難，亦屬實情，應予特別優待，依據上項原則，通過放寬辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）貼放會工貸利率，原定為月息三角六分，現對於審查貸款案件處理辦法第四條乙丙丁三類三業利率統减為月息二角四分·央行轉質押利率，由月息三角三分减為二角。間條甲項所列各類工業（包括鋼鐵五金機器造車造船酸碱化工原料等）貸款利息，减為月息一角五分。央行轉質押利息，减為一角。</p>
<p>（二）乙丙丁三類各項工業貸款期限，最長一律自三十天展為六十天。甲類各類工業慶為九十天。其有必要者，經核定後均得予以展期。</p>
<p>（三）國家行局及商業行莊，對所往來之廠家，依照貼放會所定貼放規則，塡表申請貸款者，儘量予以接受，經調查後卽速轉送該會核定，所有押品等手續，仍照貼放規則辦理。</p>
<p>（四）對於機器工業申請收購成品、儘量從寬核定。　以上通過各項，由貼放會卽日通告國家行局及銀錢信託三公會洽辦。並通過有關交通公用等貸款案八件，午後一時散會。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆濫</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根，勢仍鬆濫。業內業外，供源奇旺，而需要則甚寥落。大局問題，使市塲人心，轉見觀望。故一般市塲交易，均甚不暢。現鈔籌碼，亦未感俏。週轉極見靈動，除大鈔以外，已無貼水之象。市間拆息行市，大致仍做日拆十五元，最低十二元有供，午間十元亦見傾出。</p>
<h3>半年結息以後　金融情形良好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據金融界息：本市金融界半年結息後，一般情形尙堪維持。雖本年八九十各月中，金融界放款利率備受限制，影響業務匪淺，惟自十二月份起，利率已准提高至與市塲利率相去不遠，故十二月份之營業情形，頗稱良好，國歷年關差堪波過。現本市行莊業，已定於明年一月二三兩日，編製決算云。</p>
<p>又訊，據銀行界人士告稱：本年度決算在卽，本市銀錢業之營業情形，全年平均，率皆均有盈餘。國家行局庫，及公營銀行，獲利尤大。範圍較大之商業行莊，全年可獲一百萬金圓上下利潤，普通亦在歡十萬元左右。目前行莊之年終獎金問題，已可因此順利解決。</p>
<h3>金管普查行莊　預定三日完畢</h3>
<p>滬市金管局自昨日起，舉行全市行莊總檢查。昨日出動人員共三十人，分十五組。昨日所檢查者，為商業銀行及錢莊信託公司。預定全市三日檢查完畢。據金管局長畢德林稱，此次發動全市行莊和信託公司總檢查之目的，是在明暸一般目前行莊之資金動向及業務概况，以為本局未來金管政策之標本云。</p>
<h3>米粉油糧上揚</h3>
<p>食米昨二市到貨迭創紀綠，共　一萬八千餘石，人心不振，去化淸淡，欲升乏力。南米市况，平堅午渡，勞趨穩定。粳秈市做價，各略喊起十元與十五元不等，嗣以供過於求，納而不旺，交易轉趨懈疲，市勢旋告軟化，結果軋升士元至十五元不等。白粳三百四十元，升十元，薄稻三百四十五元，早稻三百三十元，羊尖三百四十五元，各升十五元。白元三百八十元平定，陰元三百五十元，升十五元，時粳三百五十元升十元。</p>
<p>麵粉因聞中農代糧部，將續購念萬包，人心看好。食油客銷實銷兩吒，買氣蓬勃，上升一成光景。雜糧：市况平平，黃豆，紅糧，供求相埒，無甚上落。生仁因年銷暢旺，揚州漲至六百四，加起二〇元。</p>
<h3>糖市飛升</h3>
<p>食糖昨日市勢趨堅，各帮進多出少，人心大好，塲上買氣盛旺，檯面扳持哄抬，喊價飛揚。</p>
<p>45號車白糖晨開五二〇元，中間隔昨浮空抵補，大戶擒縱，本街實銷見暢，市况踵接上升，高見五五五元，收市部份散戶脫手，市價回小五元，結果軋升六五元。粗砂興化白各挺三〇元，提莊靑漲勢尤勁，獨挺六〇元，其餘海赤台赤綿赤，暨本廠冰等，均一致軋升。</p>
<h3>客帮納胃旺盛　棉紗市氣堅俏　布疋人心振作欣欣向榮</h3>
<p>棉紗堅俏，熟門紗漲勢甚熾，粵帮納胃殊强，本街有零星採購。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳晨開一八〇〇〇〇元，中途各方需求殊殷，終以一九〇〇〇元收市，結果比週末漲一五〇〇元。四〇支藍鳳亦挺一五〇〇元，三二支銀月軋升一四〇〇元，以一六二〇〇元結束。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨自一五三〇〇元開出，曾低見一五〇〇〇元，後卽高至一六〇〇〇元收市，終漲二二〇〇元，棧單做高至一四八〇〇元又隔日出一五〇〇〇元。二〇支雙馬走勢亦俏，猛挺二二〇〇元，金城與天女等亦創新高價，一六支以下各檔粗紗交易不多，市價略見上展。</p>
<p>昨日布市始平終堅，龍頭細布初以五〇五元開出後，本街同業略思進取，客帮買意殊鮮，旋聞棉紗報漲，人心振作，浮空相偕抵補，執戶堅持不放，更在銀根抽度鬆濫下，市價欣欣向榮，中途最高曾晋至五四〇元，臨收因浮多略有拋售，價乃微回至五三五元收市，結果較週末漲起三〇元。中檔細布如五福喇叭童等亦挺三〇元左右。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰去化較狹，且市上籌碼尙充，故僅升一五元。四君子元直貢自五一五元步堅至五三二元結束，軋高七元，一九〇士林廠盤接近一〇〇〇元關，印花嗶嘰亦開高至五六〇元，午後各布趨勢續俏，聞龍頭細布五五〇元有做開。</p>
<h3>聯購處決定　增加收棉數量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國棉聯購委員會昨舉行例會，劉攻芸主席，討論結果，通過電要議案兩起：（一）加强收購國棉，增加收棉數量。現決於本年底以前，收足一百萬担，照預定目標五十萬担增加一倍。迄目前為止，已收國棉已突破卅萬担關口。（二）各地國棉應隨購隨運，應儘速趕運至紗廠所在地，以保原料之安全性而維持各廠之工作。</p>
<p>據悉：目前各地國棉正大批登塲，祗須有充份之資金，卽可大量收購。平均日購一萬五六千萬担，並無問題。資金充裕時，日收二萬担亦無因難。茲聞國棉聯購會除原有資金六億元外，齊金遇有不敷週轉時，將由國行隨時陸續墊購，以充實原棉存底云。</p>
<h3>茶市喊價疾晉</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，依然步履秀跡，原因自二天封關後，輸出商鑒於本月廿五日船期，轉瞬卽屆，故活動之意，倍於往昔，而貨方一味以產存兩稀，居奇益甚，喊價再度疾晋，是以售價之漲風，終若雨後春筍，爭相怒茁。至於內銷花色，本街等地亦有添補，市氣一致跟隨上挺。</p>

        <h1>1948.12.22</h1>
<h3>Decision on the Full List of the New Cabinet: To Be Submitted to the Central Political Committee for Approval and Announcement Today; Xu Yongchang to Take Office as Minister of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The full list of cabinet members for the Sun Ke Cabinet has been decided and will be submitted to the Kuomintang Central Political Committee meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd for approval and announcement. The original plan was to submit the list to the Central Political Committee on the 21st. However, because Mr. Sun had not yet made a final decision on a small number of candidates on his original list, he continued to consult with various parties throughout the 21st before finally finalizing the list. The first meeting of the new Executive Yuan, originally scheduled for the 22nd, will also be chaired by the Weng Cabinet for its final regular meeting. Furthermore, before the Central Political Committee meeting on the morning of the 22nd, a meeting of the Central Standing Committee will be held first to approve the case of Wu Tiecheng as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Both the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee meetings will be personally chaired by the President.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] After inquiry, the final decision on the full list of cabinet members for the Sun Cabinet is roughly as follows: Wu Tiecheng concurrently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hong Lanyou as Minister of Interior, Liu Weizhi as Minister of Industry and Commerce, Xu Kan as Minister of Finance, Pang Songzhou as Director-General of Budget, Guan Jiyu as Minister of Food, Zhong Tianxin as Minister of Water Conservancy, Gu Zhenggang as Minister of Social Affairs, Yu Dawei as Minister of Communications, Wu Shangying as Minister of Land Affairs, Li Zheng as Minister of Education, Xu Yongchang as Minister of National Defense, Lin Kesheng as Minister of Health, Mei Ru'ao as Minister of Judicial Administration, Zuo Shunsheng as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Sun Yueqi as Chairman of the National Resources Commission, Bai Yunti as Minister of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs, Chen Ce as Minister of Overseas Chinese Affairs, and Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Weng Wenhao, and Chen Lifu as Political Councilors. Another candidate, yet to be determined, will be nominated by the Youth Party.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Regarding the Reuter's report tonight citing a conversation with a certain decision-making person, which involved the new cabinet's policy choices on war and peace and the advance and retreat of the government's top leaders, inquiries to officials here received no definitive answers. There was also no information about the report's claim that the new cabinet's so-called peace is not surrender and that it will strive to strengthen itself militarily, diplomatically, and politically, and invite related countries to mediate.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Nanjing Office, 21st] The simultaneous announcement by Premier Sun Ke of the formation of a wartime cabinet and his willingness to negotiate a "glorious peace" with the Chinese Communists may have been approved by President Chiang, since all previous discussions about peace were classified as subversive actions punishable by severe penalties. It is too early to gauge the overall reaction to this announcement on the morning of the 21st. However, among U.S. officials and liberal elements within the Kuomintang, this announcement is expected to be met with the greatest approval.</p>
<h3>War Flames Gradually Approach the City Walls of Tianjin: The Focus Is on the Northern Suburbs, with Intense Gunfire; Only Small Bands of Bandit Troops Harassing the Outskirts of Peiping</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] The war outside Tianjin is gradually approaching the city's defensive works. There is fighting in the villages of Yixingbu and Dingzigu in the north of Tianjin, Dongjuzi in the east, Huidui and Baitangkou in the south, and Yangliuqing in the west. Combat fortifications at various intersections in the city have now been generally completed, entering a state of firm defense.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] The focus of the war around Tianjin remains in the north of the city. From 4:00 AM to about 10:00 AM on the 21st, the sound of artillery fire was intense, interspersed with gunfire, constantly reaching the city. According to military releases, the National Army launched a proactive attack on the morning of the 21st. On the evening of the 20th, over a thousand bandits attacked Yixingbu, Liutan, and Dingzigu in the north of Tianjin. After being bombarded by the National Army's artillery, the bandits retreated slightly. The National Army launched an assault on the bandits at dawn on the 21st, and they remained in a standoff at noon. [Another dispatch] Fierce fighting broke out again on the Yixingbu, Liutan, and Dingzigu line in the north of Tianjin on the afternoon of the 21st. The bandits launched five or six fierce assaults, all of which were repelled. The sound of artillery fire became even more intense in the evening. According to military sources, on the evening of the 20th, the 62nd and 63rd Brigades of the bandits and 2,000 local troops were discovered trying to cross the Jian River by building a bridge. They were subjected to intense gunfire from the Xiaozhan National Army, and the bandits suffered 600-700 casualties.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] It is reported that a strong Marine Corps of the National Army arrived in Tanggu by land on the 21st, but this has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] The artillery fire around Tianjin City was loud at 4:00 AM on the 21st, with intermittent machine gun fire, gradually subsiding after 9:00 AM. According to the Garrison Command, a powerful army of ours around Tianjin began actively engaging the bandits in combat on the 21st. The sounds of gunfire in the morning were the prelude to our action. A certain unit commander said that the National Army has made complete deployments and will deal a fatal blow to the bandits. On the western front of Tianjin, after our army routed more than 2,000 bandits in Yangliuqing on the 20th, about 2,000 bandits from the 72nd Division again sneaked into Daliutan, Tianjin County, from Yongqing and Anci on the evening of the 20th, and launched exploratory attacks near Yangliuqing, where fierce fighting is currently underway. The main force of the bandits in the north of Tianjin has been fiercely attacking the northwestern outskirts of the city since the 18th, in the Tianqimiao and Yixingbu area. General Lin Weichou, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Army Commander of a powerful army in the area, personally commanded at the front line and encouraged all officers and soldiers to vow to coexist with the position, with extremely high morale. He gave the invading bandits a head-on blow. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandits have collapsed, and many have been captured. Detailed battle results are under investigation.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 21st] There was fierce fighting in the southwestern suburbs of Beiping last night and this morning, and the sound of gunfire could be heard throughout the city. After 9:30 PM last night, the 5th Column of Lin Biao's bandit troops infiltrated in two groups from the Daijing area outside Guang'anmen under the cover of darkness. One group infiltrated the area west of Baiyunguan and Yuanning Temple outside Xibianmen via the Racecourse and Yunhuachi. The other group broke into Dapiying outside Guang'anmen, only a few li from Guang'anmen, and immediately engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. The National Army coordinated infantry and artillery, bombarding with fierce artillery fire for an hour. The bandits were defeated and retreated towards the Caishenmiao area. Corpses littered both sides of the road outside Guang'anmen. At the same time last night, a small group of bandit troops harassed the area from outside Guangqumen to outside Yongdingmen in the southern suburbs and were repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 21st] The fighting on the outskirts of Beiping was relatively calmer today. At 9:00 PM on the 20th, small groups of bandit troops were discovered near Luotuowan, Weiqiangjiao, and Lianhuachi in the southwest of Beiping. After being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, they engaged in fierce fighting for two hours and retreated southwest after being unable to withstand the pressure, with over 3,000 bandits killed. At noon on the 21st, small groups of bandits were active between the Princess Tomb and Chongxingsi in the west of Beiping. The National Army coordinated infantry and artillery to intercept them, and after an hour and a half of fighting, more than 250 bandits were killed. The bandits retreated west of the Princess Tomb. The outskirts of Beiping were calm in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 21st] Surrounded by the Communist army, Beiping has become a courageous but uneasy city. The city's more than two million residents are waiting for a change, and it is currently impossible to predict when the flames of war will spread from the suburbs to the city. Military camps can be seen everywhere in the city, and many hutongs have artillery positions, making it impossible for cars to pass. The front of the police station and government agencies are piled high with sandbags, and the soldiers defending the city are closely watching the movements of the Communist army outside the city, ready to fire artillery as soon as the enemy approaches. Beiping is under curfew every night from 10:00 PM, so residents have no social life. There are roughly two types of foreigners remaining in Beiping: one is anxious about the future situation and at a loss; the other pretends to be calm about the current situation or is truly indifferent. The major hotels have few guests, and the desolation is like a tomb. Regular telephone service between Beiping and Tianjin was interrupted on Saturday, but telegrams are still normal.</p>
<h3>Xu Yongchang Once Went to Beiping</h3>
<p>Ordered to Meet with Fu Zuoyi</p>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 21st] It is learned here that Xu Yongchang was commissioned to come to Peiping to meet with Fu Zuoyi, and returned to Nanjing late on the 19th to report to President Chiang.</p>
<h3>American Nationals are Reluctant to Leave the Ancient Capital: No One Has Applied to Evacuate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 21st] Regardless of how the future situation develops, no American nationals in Beiping have currently applied to evacuate. Of the original 708 American nationals in this area, 255 remain, including 87 employees of the U.S. Consulate and the Economic Cooperation Administration and their families, as well as students of language schools. Three senior U.S. military officials and four foreign reporters, who came to Beiping from Nanjing for sightseeing, are also forced to stay here and cannot return. There are still 13 American nationals within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Consulate in Beiping who are willing to stay within the jurisdiction, including two in Tongxian and several in the Yanjing and Qinghua University areas in the northwestern suburbs of Beiping. At 4:30 this morning, an American national was born in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. He is the second son of Mr. Sharonberger, the director of the Chinese language school run by the U.S. State Department in Peiping, and weighs seven pounds.</p>
<h3>5,000 Soldiers and Civilians in Peiping Rush to Build the Temple of Heaven Airfield</h3>
<p>Successful Test Landing at Tianjin's New Airfield</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] The Temple of Heaven airfield is being rushed to completion by 5,000 soldiers and civilians. The trees around the site have been felled, and the ground is being watered by the fire brigade and flattened by giant bulldozers and rollers. According to the person in charge of the construction, after completion, this airfield will be about three times larger than the Dongdan airfield and comparable to the Nanyuan airfield in the western suburbs, and there will be no problem for giant aircraft to land.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] It is reported that a C47 aircraft successfully made a test landing at Tianjin's new airfield on the 21st. Personnel from the local civil aviation team have contacted Shanghai to send planes to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Peiping City Actively Promotes Wartime Administrative Work: The Joint Army and Civilian Self-Defense Corps Is Formed, with Chu Xichun as Commander; Routine Work of the Provincial and Municipal Governments Is Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Beiping Office, 22nd] Wartime administrative work in Peiping is being actively launched. The North China Pacification Headquarters, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Peiping Municipal Government have jointly formed the Peiping Joint Army and Civilian Self-Defense Work Corps, responsible for promoting the maintenance of order, army-civilian cooperation, mobilizing the public, and eliminating bandits and traitors. Chu Xichun is the commander, and there is a guiding group consisting of Yu Jianqi, Cheng Houzhi, Yang Qingzhi, Tian Zhusheng, Gao Lanbo, and Han Da. In addition to this group, there are four working groups: the social order group, the public training group, the publicity and consolation group, and the army-civilian cooperation group. Each district will have a sub-corps, with the police precinct chief as the sub-corps commander and the district head as the sub-corps deputy commander. Each bao will also have a working group. Most of the routine work of the provincial and municipal governments has been temporarily suspended, and manpower is being concentrated to strengthen grassroots organizations and cooperate with the war effort.</p>
<h3>Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan May Be Held the Day After Tomorrow: Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan and Others Submit Resignations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] After Sun Ke announced the formation of his new cabinet, the initial reaction of the Legislative Yuan was the issue of re-electing the President and Vice President, because President Sun Ke and Vice President Chen Lifu have both joined the cabinet. Wu Tiecheng, who was rumored to be a possible candidate for President of the Legislative Yuan, has also taken office as Vice President of the Executive Yuan, so both the President and Vice President must be re-elected. However, because Chen Lifu's appointment to the cabinet has not yet been formally announced, the Legislative Yuan did not discuss the re-election issue on the 21st, but it is generally expected that the re-election will be held on the 24th. The 21st was the date of the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting, and the attendance of legislators in the morning was very enthusiastic. There was frequent contact in the meeting place. At 12:00 noon, the New Politics Club of the Legislative Yuan held a 14-seat discussion, and democratic and freedom societies held a joint meeting at the Overseas Chinese Guest House to exchange views on the candidates for President and Vice President. Wu Tiecheng also participated. A mock vote was held at the meeting to test the candidates for President. As a result, Tong Guanxian received the most votes, followed by Wang Puhan. It is heard that the three groups will use this test vote as a basis for their decision. Another group of organizations, such as the Reform Club, the Zheng You Society, and the Zhong Society, also exchanged views in the evening. The Reform Club held a meeting of its executive committee and decided to support Cheng Tianfang's candidacy for President. In addition, they also expressed support for Li Zheng, Qi Shiying, Liu Wendao, and Zou Shuwen, and decided to hold a general membership meeting at noon on the 22nd to solicit the opinions of all members. The decision of the Reform Club is said to have the support of the Zheng You Society and the Zhong Society. As for the proposal by some legislators in the past to nominate Yan Huiqing as President, because Yan is old and weak and unable to bear the heavy responsibility, and the original proposal to nominate Liu Jianqun as Vice President has also failed to obtain unanimous agreement, it is currently impossible to accurately predict who will be elected as President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. In addition, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, Yan Guofu, Deputy Secretary-General, and the main staff of the Secretariat have all submitted their resignations to President Sun, but Mr. Sun has not yet approved them.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Requests That the Confiscation of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Carried by Domestic Travelers Be Stopped, and Guizhou Be Designated as a Special Sales Area for Salt</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The 30th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 21st, chaired by Chen Lifu. After reading the minutes of the previous meeting in the morning, the reports were all approved, including the President's request for investigation regarding the declaration of martial law in all provinces and cities across the country, the Executive Yuan's request for review of the draft Foreign Exchange Management Regulations, the draft Regulations on Suppression of Rebellion Military Law, and the draft Regulations on Salt Tax Assessment. The discussion then began. Two cases were passed in the morning, one being the draft amendment to the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Social Affairs, which had been discussed for many days. The crux of the matter was the organization in Article 4 of the law, on which the opinions of the members were very divided. However, when the vote was taken, it was still passed according to the review opinion. The other was the draft Regulations on the Establishment of Accounting Agencies and Personnel in Local Governments and Their Affiliated Agencies. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. The meeting continued in the afternoon, and the following were passed: the Organizational Regulations of the Huludao Port Authority of the Ministry of Communications, the Abolition of Subsidiary Currency Regulations, three cases related to the Regulations on Land Disposal in the Sui District and the Sui District Land Bonds, the Public Enterprise Trade Union Law, the referral of the Central Guoshu Institute to the National Education and Culture Committee for review, the International Telecommunication Convention, the Regulations on Encouraging Overseas Chinese to Return to China to Invest in Industry, the formulation of minimum wage standards to maintain the livelihood of workers, the request to the Executive Yuan to promptly strengthen local self-defense forces and expand the security forces of various provinces, the reactivation of veterans and demobilized officers to strengthen the suppression of rebellion forces, the suspension of the application of the part of the election laws related to the investigation of candidates for public office, and the request to designate Guizhou as a special sales area for salt to save the lives of the people due to the soaring salt prices in Guizhou, which affect people's livelihood. Finally, two temporary motions were passed: (1) Zhang Qingzhen and others proposed that the Executive Yuan be requested to promptly order the Ministry of Finance to stop customs personnel from arbitrarily confiscating the gold, silver, and foreign currency of domestic travelers, so as to comply with government orders and facilitate travel. After discussion, in order to save time and quickly stop this illegal confiscation, it was decided to change it to an inquiry case and submit it to the Executive Yuan, and it was hoped that a result would be obtained at the next meeting and a report would be submitted. (2) Wang Zemin and others proposed that after the adjournment of this session, all legislators who return to their hometowns should assist local governments in organizing and training the public and strengthening self-defense forces. After discussion, it was decided to submit it to the National Defense Committee for review before submitting it to the general meeting for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Draft Regulations on Salt Tax Assessment</h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan Refers to the Finance and Economics Committee for Review</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Regarding the salt tax reform case, the Executive Yuan previously approved the plan to change "levy by quantity" to "levy by value" on the 4th. After the Ministry of Finance modified the relevant provisions of the Salt Administration Regulations accordingly, it has drafted the Draft Regulations on Salt Tax Assessment and requested the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The Legislative Yuan reported on this at its regular meeting on the 21st and referred it to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. It is learned that the collection of salt tax based on value will be calculated based on the average salt price in important locations in various production and sales areas across the country, minus the actual cost of needs after deducting the original tax amount, according to the following percentages: A. Salt Tax: (1) Sea salt: 70%. (2) Well salt sold in Guizhou: 15%. (3) Well salt sold in other regions other than Guizhou: 40%. (4) Pond salt sold in Shaanxi: 5%. (5) Pond salt sold in other regions other than Shaanxi: 60%. (6) Local salt and Qing salt: 30%. B. Fishing salt and salt for use: 5%. C. Industrial salt and agricultural salt are exempt from tax. Salt that is specially permitted for export and import shall be subject to salt tax in addition to customs duties, and the tax rate shall be determined separately. However, the Ministry of Finance may, depending on the domestic production and sales situation, submit a report to the Executive Yuan for approval to exempt its salt tax. The purpose of this method is to balance salt prices, equalize the burden on the people, eliminate profiteering, prevent hoarding, coordinate with prices, stabilize the sales market, and ensure the treasury revenue and supply for the suppression of rebellion.</p>
<h3>Presidential Decree Revises the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Procedure</h3>
<p>Xiang Zhejun Appointed as Prosecutor-General of the Supreme Court</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Presidential Decree: The following is hereby promulgated to amend Articles 26 and 27 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration.

Article 27. The duration of this Regulation is four years, and events belonging to it during the period of implementation shall be concluded in accordance with this Regulation.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The President issued the following orders on the 21st: (1) Xiang Zhejun, Prosecutor of the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court, shall be relieved of his current position due to other appointments.

<h3>The First Batch of Our Officers and Soldiers Who Went to the United States to Receive Warships Will Return Home Before Christmas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The naval officers and soldiers recently sent by our country to the United States to receive warships received short-term training after arriving at their destination, which has now been completed. The first batch of personnel assigned to the United States for the warships given to our country will leave the United States and return home before Christmas, and the second batch will return home around January next year. These naval heroes are the most outstanding and experienced naval officers and soldiers in the country. Overseas Chinese in the United States are very respectful and loving towards the naval officers and soldiers of their motherland. From the day they arrived, overseas Chinese have held welcome dances every day to show their respect and love. Our naval officers and soldiers, who have left their motherland for the first time and traveled across the ocean, are greatly inspired by the exotic customs and the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Is Stable</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Hankou Office, 21st] Amidst the tranquility and serenity here, a report in a Hong Kong newspaper carried the news that Wuhan and Xinyang were under pressure. Readers laughed it off. Later, according to an authority, such rumors are not worth refuting. The calmness of the people of Wuhan is enough to shatter them.</p>
<h3>Guan Linzheng Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Suzhou Office, 21st] After Guan Linzheng reviewed the 202nd Division stationed in Suzhou, he gave a general review to all officers and soldiers at the division headquarters on the morning of the 21st, and personally awarded prizes and bonuses to more than 30 officers and soldiers.

<h3>The Shanghai Yangzi Company Hoarding Case: The Censorate Issues an Impeachment: Wu Guozhen, Yu Shuping, Huo Baoshu, and Others Are All Involved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Censorate issued an impeachment on the 21st by Censors Xiong Zaixiao and Jin Yueguang regarding the hoarding case of the Yangzi Construction Company, with a full text of about 12,000 words. It was decided at the Censorate's regular meeting in October to send personnel to investigate the hoarding of large quantities of materials by the Shanghai Yangzi Construction Company. The President of the Censorate then assigned Censors Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang to Shanghai to conduct an on-site investigation, which lasted only two months. According to the investigation results of Censors Xiong and Jin, Yangzi Company hoarded 3,000-4,000 boxes of Western medicine, pigments, cosmetics, and daily necessities made of glass. In addition, the Lihan Company, which has close ties with Yangzi Company, has 75 new cars and 10 trucks in stock. Even if calculated at the lowest current value, the total is more than 20 million Gold Yuan. Mr. Xiong and others believe that Kong Lingkan, the general manager of the company, is suspected of taking advantage of his power to evade taxes, hoarding goods for speculation, and illegally profiting. The Yangzi Construction Company should be subject to a business suspension penalty, and the judicial part should be transferred to the court for handling. The two censors also believe that Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Police Chief Yu Shuping, Police Chief of the Police Squad Cheng Yikuan, Huang Zubei, Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, and Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Import and Export Management Committee, and Zhang Yongnian, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, all have dereliction of duty and have also been impeached together. The case was established on the morning of the 21st after being reviewed by Censors Liu Yantao, Wang Xiangchen, and Wang Shulin, and was immediately sent to the Executive Yuan for handling. The Censorate recently issued the full text of the impeachment as follows:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of October this year, after newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai published the news that Shanghai Yangzi Construction Company was hoarding large quantities of materials, public opinion was in an uproar. The court decided to send personnel to investigate the case; Zaiwei and Yueguang were assigned to go to Shanghai to investigate. The facts of the case and those who should be impeached are described below:</p>
<p>(A) Part of the facts</p>
<p>(Zi) The occurrence of this case: This case was discovered by the Lujiawan Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau on September 29 this year when it found large trucks smuggling materials. It was found that the second floor of the Lihua Automobile Company was hoarding large quantities of Western medicine, woolen cloth, pigments, Vaseline, etc., as well as 70 new cars and 10 trucks, which were said to belong to Yangzi Construction Company. Patrol Officer Ying Pinxiang immediately requested a report to the Shanghai Police Bureau. After receiving the report, the Police Bureau handed it over to the Economic Police Squad to send personnel to investigate. This is the discovery of a major hoarding case that shocked Shanghai. In fact, the occurrence of this case was earlier than September 19. According to the squad member, Kong Lingkan had verbally reported the hoarding of materials on September 19 and reported it in writing to Ji Dezun, the group leader of the inspection group of the team, that a large number of materials were stored in a car shop on Maoming South Road, and requested that personnel be sent to investigate. On the same day, Group Leader Ji signed the original report "It is proposed that Comrade Zhao Hongkuan of this group and Comrade Mao Xinfu of the action group go for a secret investigation." It was sent to the team leader of the team, Cheng Yikuan, for approval. Team Leader Cheng approved it on the 23rd. On the 24th, Zhao Hongkuan and others reported: Briefly stating that the car shop is named Lihan Automobile Company, and the household registration section of the Lujiawan Police Branch does not have the name of the car shop owner. In the large repair shop upstairs, there are several large warehouses of the same kind, containing dozens of wooden boxes. When approaching the window, you can vaguely see the contents, but because you cannot enter, you do not know what is stored. Please issue a duty certificate to find out. However, the team did not deal with it, resulting in the occurrence of this case on September 29. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>After Reporting to Truman, Hoffman Gave a Speech: The $70 Million China Construction Project Is Decided to Be Suspended</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Agency] Washington, 21st Broadcast: Economic Cooperation Agency Director Hoffman met with Truman at the White House for half an hour on the 21st to report on his trip to Europe and the Far East. After the meeting, Mr. Hoffman gave a speech saying that in view of the urgent situation in China, the $70 million China construction project has been suspended. This measure was decided in consultation with Raphaelson in Shanghai. Mr. Hoffman said that the ECA has decided to continue some construction projects, including the Taiwan power plant, the reconstruction of the South China Railway, and the wharf project at the Qingdao U.S. Navy base. The ECA may ask Congress to continue to allocate funds to advance the ECA plan until the end of June next year. He said that the situation in China is volatile and it is not possible to determine long-term construction projects. The situation in China must be clearer than it is now before the ECA can plan a long-term funding request.</p>
<h3>The Huai-Bei National Army Crosses the Xie River; The Liu-Chen Bandit Forces Cannot Be Employed Without a Long Period of Reorganization and Replenishment; Rumor that General Huang Wei has been Captured, Bandit Leader Liu Bocheng has Been Bombed to Death</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Bengbu, 21st] After more than twenty days of fierce fighting on the Bengbu-Su County battlefield, the situation is now calming down.

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Bengbu, 21st] There is no fighting south of the Xie River, and the remnant bandits have all fled north. According to a statement from the Suppression Headquarters, the Du Yuming unit on the northern front began sweeping up the Chen bandit forces around Qinglongji yesterday.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Bengbu, 21st] Officers and soldiers who were separated from the Huang Wei Corps during the breakout have been arriving in Bengbu one after another in recent days and are being received by a certain logistics organization.

<h3>Editorial: Protest Against Arming Japan!</h3>
<p>The news that the United States is stepping up the arming of Japanese troops has been constantly circulating recently. The U.S. authorities not only do not deny it but also express a deep interest in it. Our country is geographically adjacent to Japan and has deeply felt the pain of aggression for seventy years. If Japanese militarism is revived, the threat to our country will be very significant. Therefore, based on the standpoint of national security and the standpoint of the Allied powers controlling Japan, we should lodge a serious protest against the United States' stepping up the arming of Japan!</p>
<p>Since Japan surrendered three years ago, under the sole control of the United States, the old forces have gradually revived and risen. Regarding the issue of Japanese armament, there was the establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency and the restoration of 125,000 armed police officers. Our public opinion protested the establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency, believing that this was equivalent to the restoration of the Ministry of the Navy. The U.S. authorities and the Allied Headquarters said that the Maritime Safety Agency was an anti-smuggling organization and had no armed equipment. Our public opinion protested the restoration of 125,000 Japanese police officers, citing the example of Germany rebuilding the Nazi army with 100,000 police officers after World War I, arousing the high alert of the United States and the Allied Headquarters. The U.S. authorities and the Allied Headquarters said that Japan needed this self-defense force to maintain public order and suppress reactionaries. At meetings of the Far Eastern Commission, the Allied powers protested the arming of Japan, and the U.S. representative denied everything. The Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo was only allowed to listen to MacArthur's "peaceful Japan" instructions and was not allowed to raise questions about "arming Japan." In fact, this fait accompli already exists and is continuing to develop. Except for the Japanese, almost no one believes that the United States' arming of Japan is not a fact.</p>
<p>Recently, due to deviations in the United States' Far Eastern policy, the theory of actively supporting Japan has become increasingly prevalent. In terms of rhetoric, U.S. officials and even public opinion openly support the revival of Japan. Some even believe that the rise of Japan is beneficial to the future Far Eastern situation. In terms of action, the U.S. authorities' arming of Japan is not only manifested in the economic and ideological spheres but also in the political sphere, gradually reviving the declining militarism. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 13th of this month, the United States is considering establishing an armed police force of 100,000 to 150,000 in Japan so that Japan will not become a vacuum after the withdrawal of the occupying forces. A senior U.S. government official publicly expressed keen interest on the 20th and pointed out that this proposal was advocated by Acheson, MacArthur's former assistant in Japan, and naturally supported by MacArthur. Diplomats believe that Japan has a total population of 80 million, and Acheson only advocates 150,000 armed troops, which is not a large number. What the United States fears now is that this proposal will be strongly opposed by the Soviet Union when it is submitted to the Far Eastern Commission. In fact, this plan that threatens Far Eastern security and violates the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan will likely be opposed by any country in the Far Eastern Commission other than the United States.</p>
<p>The Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions are the highest guidelines for the Allied powers' control of Japan. The future peace treaty with Japan will also use this principle as the standard for the treaty. The Allied Headquarters in Tokyo was originally the agency for the Far Eastern Commission to implement the occupation and control, but for the past three years, the Allied Headquarters' implementation of occupation and control policies has been entirely determined by one country's ideology and one country's defense, and it has not truly implemented the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions. Therefore, the errors in the Allied Headquarters' policy of controlling Japan today are entirely the result of deviations in the United States' Far Eastern policy. Acheson is MacArthur's Japanese think tank. When he was serving in Japan, perhaps because he was anesthetized by the Japanese sweet talk, he tried his best to support Japan's economic, armed, and ideological armament. Now that he has returned to the State Department, he has proposed to the government the recommendation to arm Japan with 150,000 troops, which may be accepted by the government and may be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for forced recognition after a fait accompli has been created. We believe that this measure that violates the Potsdam Declaration and threatens peace in the Far East is extremely unreasonable. Based on the standpoint of national security, our country should oppose this willful measure. Based on the standpoint that our country bears the responsibility of the Allied powers to control Japan, it should seek diplomatic channels to correct the errors of Acheson's proposal. In any case, we cannot remain silent about the United States' arming of Japan. The soon-to-be-established Sun Cabinet, I wonder what the diplomatic authorities will do about this?</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Completes the Revision of Required Courses for University Departments, to be Implemented from the Freshman Year of the Next Academic Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 21st] The course schedules for the eight colleges of liberal arts, science, law, medicine, agriculture, engineering, commerce, and normal schools were promulgated and implemented successively between the years of 27 and 28. The courses for the four colleges of liberal arts, science, law, and normal schools were revised again in the 33rd year. Since its implementation, schools have felt that the courses are too complicated, the required credits are too many, and basic training cannot achieve advanced tasks. As a result, both teaching parties are restricted by regulations and cannot develop their strengths according to their aspirations. Therefore, the Ministry of Education instructed the responsible personnel to start revising the required courses for various university departments, and used the principles of (1) focusing on basic training, (2) concentrating courses, and (3) reducing required credits as the standard for revision. Since the 34th year, the opinions of various universities have been solicited first, and the Ministry has formulated a draft in accordance with the above principles, sent it to experts for comments, and made preliminary revisions based on these comments. Review meetings were convened separately with the course schedules of each department as a unit. After careful discussion and careful decision-making, it took three years to complete. It is now known that this revised required course schedule for the Academy of Entering Studies has been ordered to be promulgated to universities across the country, and will be implemented from the first year of the 38th academic year. The important contents that are different from before are as follows: (1) Focusing on basic training, reducing required credits, and concentrating courses, so that each school can adjust according to its talent and equipment. (2) The common required courses for all departments, Chinese and the first foreign language, are both listed as eight credits and studied for one year. Each school may conduct rigorous examinations on the Chinese and first foreign language levels of freshmen before they start classes in the first year. If the results are excellent and indeed exceed the first year of university level, they may be exempted from studying, and the credits will be reduced by half, but they must select other courses to make up the credits that should be completed at graduation. In addition, each school may designate professors to organize a language committee to specialize in guiding study and grade assessment. (3) All departments may not be divided into groups unless approved. If it is really necessary, professors may guide students to study the subjects they should study according to their wishes for elective courses, but if two departments are merged, they may be taught in groups with reference to the required course schedules of each department. (4) All common required courses for the departments should make every effort to open large classrooms (the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and law should preferably have a suitable large classroom for each department), and accommodate as many students as possible to attend classes together, and classes should not be set up separately by department in order to communicate with each other in the whole school, but the number of students in each language class should not exceed 40.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools Will Not Enroll New Students in the Next Semester</h3>

<h3>The Siamese Government's Attitude is Stubborn, Insisting on Reducing the Immigration Quota; The Siamese Foreign Ministry Officially Replies to Our Note</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Bangkok, 20th] Our embassy in Siam received a formal reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning. Our government protested to the government of Siam regarding the large reduction in the number of Chinese immigrants by the Siamese side. The Siamese government only replied to our note today, still insisting on the Siamese cabinet's decision to reduce the number of Chinese immigrants allowed by the Feng Shishang government by 98%. The Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs put forward two arguments in its reply: (1) Adjusting the immigration quota is purely a matter of Siamese internal affairs and does not need to be negotiated with other countries. (2) For economic reasons, Siam cannot allow a large number of Chinese to pour into Siam. However, the reply did not mention the respect for the original agreement between the Chinese government and the Feng Tanlong cabinet. A spokesman for our embassy said at a press conference today that he was deeply disappointed by the Siamese government's stubborn attitude in negotiating the immigration quota issue. It is reported that in addition to reporting the Siamese reply to Nanjing, the embassy will file a new protest with the Siamese government.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] The Indonesian delegation to the United Nations announced on the 21st that the Indonesian Republican Army has recaptured Yogyakarta. The delegation also reported that almost all of West Java has risen up in revolt against the Netherlands, and two cities in East Java have also revolted. The delegation stated that the news of the recapture of Yogyakarta came from a Republican secret radio station in the tea region of Java. It also claimed that the Indonesian army has occupied the cities of Kebumen and Magelang, previously garrisoned by Dutch troops. The Indonesian side further claimed that 52 Dutch paratroopers were killed in combat.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] An Indonesian spokesperson said today that, according to news from Singapore, Indonesian troops have recaptured the capital city of Yogyakarta, and fierce fighting has broken out in the city. Fifty-two Dutch paratroopers were killed. This news was obtained from a state Indonesian secret radio station. At the same time, a Dutch military spokesman in The Hague considered this news to be false.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 21st] The New York Times reported today that, according to reliable sources, an Indonesian government-in-exile will be announced today, possibly in India.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 21st] Indonesian Republican figures scattered around the world are in contact with each other today. It is rumored that Manila will be the location of the government-in-exile, but Indonesian figures believe it is still too early.

<h3>U.S. to Recommend to Security Council – Order Dutch Troops to Cease Fire Immediately – Original Proposal for Dutch Troops to Withdraw to Original Defense Lines Not Agreed Upon by All Parties</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] A spokesman for the U.S. delegation to the Security Council said today that the U.S. has abandoned its plan to demand that Dutch troops withdraw to the boundary lines prior to the attack on Indonesia. It will only propose a ceasefire because the majority of the Security Council representatives are unwilling to support a proposal ordering the Netherlands to withdraw its troops. According to a Dutch spokesman, the Dutch military may accept a ceasefire order after completing major military operations in Java and Sumatra. However, withdrawing to the old boundary lines would be difficult to implement and would cause disputes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Canberra, 21st] Australian Prime Minister Chifley declared after today's cabinet meeting that Australia will ask the United Nations Security Council to order an immediate ceasefire in Indonesia and to have Dutch troops withdraw to the lines prior to the offensive. The Security Council can use economic or other sanctions to promote a ceasefire in Indonesia. The Australian government has ordered its representative to the Security Council to discuss further measures to resolve the dispute with representatives from various countries, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, such as holding elections in Indonesia immediately and considering placing Indonesia under a trusteeship system.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] At the personal request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the Security Council postponed consideration of the Indonesian war on the 20th. Mr. Molotov is in Moscow. U.S. Representative Jessup, greatly troubled by the outbreak of the Indonesian war, hastily flew here from his sickbed in Nice to attend the meeting scheduled for the 20th. He said that the U.S. government considers this crisis "very serious." Jessup requested that Security Council President Langehove make an "urgent appeal" to the Soviet Union, requesting that Soviet Representative Malik come to the meeting on the 21st if possible. At the request of Jessup and Syrian Representative Kurri, Langehove agreed to order the Mediation Committee to submit more reports on the Indonesian situation before the meeting on the 22nd. Jessup explained that it may be difficult to quickly obtain reports because the U.S. representative to the Mediation Committee, Cochran, is now in Batavia, while the Belgian and Australian representatives are in Karilang in the Republican area, and there is no communication between the two sides. Earlier, a U.S. spokesman had said that the U.S. had proposed that Malik leave Berlin by air, but Malik was unlikely to accept this. Soviet sources made people suspect that Malik would be able to arrive in time for the meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] After holding an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council today, the Dutch government submitted a memorandum to the Council, stating that international intervention in the Indonesian incident would be of no avail.

The Indonesian Republic is to blame for failing to cooperate in fulfilling the agreement to establish the Indonesian Federation agreed upon on January 1 of this year.</p>

<h3>Indonesian Minister to the U.S. Asks U.S. – To Stop Aid to the Netherlands – Support Indonesia Politically and Economically</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Indonesian Republican Minister Sumitro told reporters today that the Indonesian Republican government is determined to fight the Dutch military to the end. The new government will be established in Bukittinggi, Sumatra. If that place is occupied, it will be moved elsewhere. As long as the Indonesian Republic has territory, it will have a government. Eventually, a government-in-exile can be established. He dares to predict that the Dutch military will soon encounter significant resistance in the mountainous areas. To uphold justice, the U.S. should support Indonesia politically and economically. It should not be satisfied with mediation alone but should seriously consider cutting off aid to the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan and should support the Indonesian Republic in breaking the two-year Dutch blockade of Indonesian regional foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Australian Mediator – Is Missing in Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York 21st Broadcast Batavia News: Rumors are circulating that the Australian representative to the Dutch-Indonesian Mediation Committee has suddenly gone missing. It is said that he went out for a picnic on the morning of the 19th and has been missing ever since, but this cannot be confirmed due to disrupted transportation.</p>
<h3>Judd Analyzes Indonesian Situation Through Chinese Lens – U.S. Refusal to Aid China Deemed Laughable</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Congressman Judd, in a solo interview with a United Press reporter on the 21st, said: The Indonesian war is nothing less than a powder keg for the entire Far East. He continued: "Colonial wars will give the Soviet Union the best propaganda weapons. Soviet propagandists will seize the old banner of nationalism and declare that they can liberate Asia from white rule and gain freedom. Before the war, the Japanese shouted that Asia is for Asians. Although Japan has failed, this concept has taken root in the minds of many Asians. Although Japan's real meaning was simply that Asia is for Japanese, now the Soviet Union's imitation is just that Asia is for Soviet Union, but Asians will not realize this, because the Soviet Union is a hundred times smarter than Japan." Judd compared the situation in Indonesia with China. He said: The U.S. refuses to give aid to the Chinese government, "But at the same time, while the Netherlands is launching a war against Indonesia, we are supporting the Netherlands with aid from the economic recovery plan. I am not saying that we should exclude the Netherlands from the economic recovery plan, but if we still support Europeans who are fighting Asians and refuse to support Chinese who are fighting Chinese, it will be a very interesting contrast."</p>
<h3>Dutch Lower House – Rejects Communist Motion – Maintains Hostile Attitude Towards Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, The Hague, 21st] The Dutch Lower House last night passed a motion supporting Prime Minister Drees' policy towards Indonesia with 88 votes against a minority vote. Only the Communist Party voted against it, and the Communist Party's motion to immediately cease hostile actions failed as a result.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, The Hague, 20th] Dutch Prime Minister Drees announced at the war meeting on the Indonesian issue that someone in the audience shouted "Down with the colonial war, long live peace!" Three people were arrested and all旁臘者 (translates roughly to "onlookers") were expelled.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Officially Attacks Netherlands – Accuses Dutch of Using Mediation Committee as a Trap to Destroy Indonesia – Long Intended to Settle Matters by Force</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio commentator Linitsky today accused the Netherlands of using the trap of the United Nations Mediation Committee to destroy the Indonesian Republic. It is claimed that the Mediation Committee, composed of representatives from the United States, Australia, and Belgium, ostensibly assists in resolving the Indonesian issue and supervising the ceasefire but actually serves as a smokescreen for foreign intervention in Indonesia. With the protection of the Committee, the plot to destroy Indonesia by means of dismemberment and blockade has matured, and the Committee is actually a conspiracy group. When conducting negotiations, the only goal of the Dutch authorities was to wait for a suitable opportunity to break them and create open warfare. The Dutch ruling class claims that this military action was forced upon them, but in fact, the Dutch military was always prepared to settle matters by force. The Netherlands does not use the ceasefire to seek peace but uses the opportunity to transfer troops and replenish its weapons with U.S. and British munitions. The Security Council will continue to discuss the Indonesian issue on the 22nd, and the Soviet Union's attitude can be seen in the above remarks.</p>
<h3>U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Appeal – Tojo and Others Soon to Die – MacArthur Can Order Secret Execution at Any Time</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Allied officials announced on the 21st that they believe the execution of Tojo and his colleagues will not take place within at least 24 hours. Sources said that after receiving formal notification that the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to intervene in the war crimes trials, MacArthur will immediately order Tojo and the other six war criminals sentenced to death to be executed. It is generally believed that the execution may be announced at any time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur discussed the date and procedures for the execution by hanging of seven war criminals, including Tojo, with Eighth Army Commander Walker today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The U.S. Supreme Court today decided to reject the appeal of the Japanese war criminals by a vote of six to one. The rationale for the ruling stated: "The appellants were convicted by the Far East Military Tribunal, which was composed of the United States and the Allied nations currently occupying Japan. MacArthur was elected commander of the Allied forces, and the judgment of the military tribunal has been approved by MacArthur. In this situation, the U.S. court has no right to review, acknowledge, postpone, or abolish this judgment. For this reason, the appellants' request for habeas corpus is to be rejected." Although only seven Japanese war criminals applied for an appeal - Hirota, Doihara, Kido, Oka Takasumi, Sato, Shimada, and Togo - the Supreme Court's ruling applies to all 25 Japanese war criminals. All of these criminals will be executed under the supervision of MacArthur and presided over by the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in accordance with the original judgment of the Far East Tribunal.</p>
<h3>Wills of Seven Criminals – To Be Published After Death</h3>

It is said that he has the wills and final statements of the seven criminals, which will be published after the executions.</p>
<h3>"Tokyo Rose" Case – U.S. Court Continues Trial</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 20th] The Federal Court today reopened the trial of "Tokyo Rose" Ikuko Toguri D'Aquino for treason. The defendant's lawyer, Collins, said that the defendant has already served her sentence in Tokyo and cannot be tried again. Furthermore, D'Aquino married a Portuguese man, D'Aquino, and has become a Portuguese citizen, and the U.S. court may not try her again. Government lawyer De Valfar said that pre-trial detention cannot take effect, and D'Aquino's crime occurred before her marriage, so she can still be tried by the U.S. court.</p>
<h3>Italian and French Foreign Ministers – Wide-Ranging Talks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Gonna, 20th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and French Foreign Minister Schumann met here today for two and a half hours, which is closely related to Italy's future attitude towards the Western European powers.

All issues from Germany to Palestine will be reviewed from an international perspective. It is heard that Sforza expressed his approval of France's position on Germany, but Italy is particularly willing to increase trade with Germany.

The white paper also acknowledges that if Britain's four-year plan is completed, other countries under the European Economic Cooperation General Office will feel a lack of gold pound holdings, but the white paper emphasizes that this plan is not fixed.</p>
<h3>Budget Amendment Finally Passed – Japanese Parliament to be Dissolved Soon – Allied Command to Take Action to Stop Japanese Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] After the leaders of the Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative Parties met with General Hodges, the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, last night, they immediately rushed to compile an amended budget案(proposal).

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Allied Command will take drastic action to curb the recent wave of strikes that are jeopardizing Japan's economy. In a letter to Prime Minister Yoshida yesterday, MacArthur emphasized that neither Japanese labor nor management should hinder the acceleration of production. The seeds of the Japanese strike wave have been sown for a long time. Recently, the amendment to the National Public Service Law passed by the parliament, which prohibits government workers from collectively petitioning and the right to strike, has led to strike events. Heller, the head of the Labor Section of the Allied Command, spent the whole day today consulting with union leaders, requesting them to seek an agreement with the capital as soon as possible regarding wage disputes. The nationwide seafarers' strike in Japan has been going on for about 20 days, and 70% of loading and unloading operations have been halted, disrupting transportation and greatly affecting industrial production.</p>

The farmers' associations will adopt the rules of labor unions.</p>

<h3>Investigation Meeting Determines Two Causes of the Jiangya Steamer Accident, Not Boiler Explosion, No Navigational Errors</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to thoroughly clarify the truth of the Jiangya Steamer accident and to listen to opinions from all sides on the case, the Ministry of Transportation dispatched Mr. Wang Fuyi, a counselor from the ministry, to Shanghai. Together with Mr. Hong Ruitao, director of the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, he convened a meeting of 21 relevant organizations at 9:00 AM yesterday on the sixth floor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company building to conduct an investigation. The invited attendees included representatives from the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee Office, the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate, the Shanghai Port Headquarters, the China Maritime Pilots Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's General Union, the Shanghai Tongsha Pilot Association, the China Corporation Register of Shipping, the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Chinese Maritime Construction Society, the First Naval District Headquarters, the Chinese Marine Engineers' Association, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Waterborne Inspection Unit, the First Naval Military Region Headquarters, the Chinese Merchant Marine Officers' Association, the Ningbo Association, the Songhan Transportation Society, the National Shipping Industry Federation, and the Maritime Administration Bureau, totaling 21 units from the Ministry of Transportation. Captain Shen Dacai of the Jiangya Steamer and the chief mate also attended the meeting. The focus of the meeting was on studying two points: (1) the cause of the explosion on the Jiangya Steamer, and (2) whether the navigation route of the Jiangya Steamer was incorrect at the time of the accident. After the discussion began, representatives from all units spoke enthusiastically. The debate between the legal team of the Ningbo Association and the captain of the Jiangya Steamer was particularly intense. On the point of the cause of the explosion, opinions from all sides differed. The representative from the Navy believed that, based on observations of the traces, the explosion on the Jiangya Steamer may have been caused by encountering a drifting mine, but stated that it was impossible to make a definitive judgment. After research, because the Ningbo Association consistently failed to provide evidence to the contrary, the "preliminary decision" on the above two points was: (1) The Jiangya Steamer accident was not due to a boiler explosion. (2) The navigation route of the Jiangya Steamer was not incorrect at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Director Hong of the Maritime Administration Bureau, regarding the cause of the Jiangya Steamer accident, the bureau will still work with the District Procuratorate, the Ningbo Association, and other relevant agencies to send personnel to the location where the Jiangya Steamer sank to continue on-site inspection.</p>

<h3>To Salvage the Difficult Situation of Current Industry: Industrial Loan Measures Decided to Be Relaxed; Interest Rates Reduced Separately, Deadlines Appropriately Extended; Applications for Acquisition by the Machinery Industry Generously Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Report] For the sake of favoring the industrial sector, considerable revisions have been made to the industrial loan measures in terms of interest rates and deadlines. The Central Bank Discount Committee held its 19th meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun. First, Lin Chong [name] reported that after the promulgation of the Emergency Loan Measures for Production Enterprises, there were many applications for the acquisition of finished products. The Review Committee has been actively reviewing them and has passed many acquisition cases after holding two meetings. A Finished Product Acquisition Evaluation Committee has been organized, with impartial figures from various departments of the industrial sector as members, to fairly assess acquisition prices and entrust the undertaking banks and bureaus to handle them accordingly, which is progressing smoothly. As for pledge loans, although measures have been decided, there are still many difficulties hindering implementation. Industrial circles believe that loan interest rates are high and deadlines are short, and the undertaking banks and bureaus are concerned about risks and unwilling to undertake them. All these problems must be solved to facilitate implementation. In particular, the machinery industry is in the most difficult situation and hopes for more leniency. After discussion by the committee members present, they all agreed that the current situation of the industrial sector is indeed very difficult, and the loan measures should be relaxed to overcome the difficulties. The machinery industry is particularly difficult, which is also true and should be given special preference. Based on the above principles, the following relaxed measures were passed:</p>
<p>(1) The industrial loan interest rate of the Discount Committee, originally set at 3.6% per month, is now uniformly reduced to 2.4% per month for the three types of industries (B, C, and D) under Article 4 of the Measures for Handling Review of Loan Cases. The Central Bank's re-pledge interest rate is reduced from 3.3% per month to 2%. The loan interest rate for various industries listed in Item A (including steel, hardware, machinery, shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, acid-base chemical raw materials, etc.) is reduced to 1.5% per month. The Central Bank's re-pledge interest rate is reduced to 1%.</p>
<p>(2) The maximum loan term for the three types of industries (B, C, and D) is uniformly extended from 30 days to 60 days. The term for various industries in Category A is 90 days. If necessary, extensions may be granted upon approval.</p>
<p>(3) National banks, bureaus, and commercial banks and firms should accept applications for loans from manufacturers with whom they do business, in accordance with the Discount Committee's discount rules. After investigation, they should quickly forward them to the committee for approval. All pledge procedures should still be handled in accordance with the discount rules.</p>
<p>(4) Applications for the acquisition of finished products by the machinery industry should be generously approved. The above passed items will be announced by the Discount Committee to the national banks, bureaus, and the three public associations of silver, money, and trust companies for consultation and handling. Eight loan cases related to transportation, public utilities, etc. were also passed. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Overly Loose Monetary Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the monetary situation in this city remained overly loose. The supply of funds was extraordinarily strong both inside and outside the industry, while demand was very scarce. Problems with the overall situation have caused market sentiment to turn to wait-and-see. Therefore, general market transactions were very sluggish. The demand for cash chips was not strong either. Turnover was extremely flexible. Except for large bills, there was no longer any sign of discount. The market interest rate for interbank lending was generally around 15 yuan for overnight loans, with a minimum of 12 yuan for supply. At noon, 10 yuan was also seen being dumped.</p>
<h3>Good Financial Situation After Half-Yearly Interest Settlement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to financial circles: After the half-yearly interest settlement in the financial sector of this city, the general situation is still maintainable. Although loan interest rates in the financial sector were severely restricted in August, September, and October of this year, which greatly affected business, the interest rates have been allowed to increase to a level not far from the market interest rates since December. Therefore, the business situation in December was quite good, and the Lunar New Year was able to be passed with relative ease. It is now determined that banks and firms in this city will compile financial statements on January 2nd and 3rd of next year.</p>
<p>In addition, according to sources in the banking industry: With the annual financial statement approaching, the business situation of the silver and money industry in this city, on average for the whole year, all have surpluses. National banks, bureaus, and public banks have particularly large profits. Commercial banks and firms with larger scope can earn around one million gold yuan in profit for the whole year, and ordinary ones also earn around tens of thousands of yuan. Currently, the year-end bonus issue for banks and firms can be resolved smoothly as a result.</p>
<h3>Financial Management General Inspection of Banks and Firms Scheduled to Be Completed in Three Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Financial Administration Bureau began a general inspection of all banks and firms in the city yesterday. A total of 30 personnel were dispatched yesterday, divided into 15 groups. Those inspected yesterday were commercial banks, money shops, and trust companies. It is planned that the inspection of the entire city will be completed in three days.

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of rice in the two markets hit a record high, totaling more than 18,000 dan. With depressed sentiment, sales were sluggish, and efforts to raise prices were weak. The situation in the southern rice market was stable at noon, tending towards stability. The prices of japonica and indica rice were each raised slightly by 10 yuan and 15 yuan, respectively. However, with supply exceeding demand, the market was not strong, and transactions became sluggish. The market trend then softened, resulting in an increase of only 10 yuan to 15 yuan. White japonica was 340 yuan, up 10 yuan; thin paddy was 345 yuan; early rice was 330 yuan; and Yangjian rice was 345 yuan, each up 15 yuan. White round rice was stable at 380 yuan, and Yin round rice was 350 yuan, up 15 yuan. Seasonal japonica was 350 yuan, up 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to rumors that the Central Agricultural Grain Department will continue to purchase 1 million bags, sentiment towards flour was optimistic. Cooking oil had both wholesale and retail sales, with vigorous buying interest and a price increase of about 10%. Miscellaneous grains: the market situation was flat, with supply and demand for soybeans and red sorghum being roughly equal, with little fluctuation. Raw peanuts were selling well annually, with the price in Yangzhou rising to 640 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Soars</h3>
<p>The sugar market was strong yesterday. Each group bought more and sold less, with great market sentiment. Buying interest was strong on the market, with traders holding up prices and shouting prices flying.</p>
<p>No. 45 white sugar opened at 520 yuan in the morning. In the middle, there was intraday covering of short positions, with large players maneuvering. Retail sales were strong, and the market situation continued to rise, reaching a high of 555 yuan. At the close, some retail investors sold off, and the market price retreated slightly by 5 yuan, resulting in an overall increase of 65 yuan. Coarse sand and Xinghua white each rose by 30 yuan. The increase in the price of refined Zhuangqing was particularly strong, rising by 60 yuan. The remaining Hai red, Taiwan red, cotton red, and local ice sugar all rose in unison.</p>
<h3>Strong Demand from Guest Dealers: Cotton Yarn Market Remains Firm; Fabric Market Shows Vigor and Prosperity</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn is firm, with the price of familiar brands rising sharply. Demand from Guangdong dealers is particularly strong, and there are sporadic purchases in the local market.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 180,000 yuan in the morning. In the middle, demand from all parties was very strong, and it finally closed at 190,000 yuan, resulting in an increase of 1,500 yuan compared to the weekend. 40-count Blue Phoenix also rose by 1,500 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon rose by 1,400 yuan, closing at 16,200 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 15,300 yuan and fell to a low of 15,000 yuan, then rose to a high of 16,000 yuan at the close, resulting in a final increase of 2,200 yuan. Warehouse receipts were priced as high as 14,800 yuan, then changed hands at 15,000 yuan the next day. 20-count Double Horse also traded well, rising sharply by 2,200 yuan. Golden City and Heavenly Maiden also hit new high prices. There were not many transactions for yarns of 16 counts and below, and market prices rose slightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fabric market started flat and ended strong. Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 505 yuan. Local peers were slightly aggressive, but customer demand was very low. Later, upon hearing that the price of cotton yarn had risen, sentiment improved, and short positions were covered together. Holders insisted on not selling, and with the loose monetary situation, market prices showed vigor and prosperity. In the middle, the price reached a high of 540 yuan. Near the close, due to some selling by long holders, the price retreated slightly to close at 535 yuan, resulting in an increase of 30 yuan compared to the weekend. Medium-grade fine cloths such as Five Blessings, Trumpet, and Children also rose by around 30 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji were relatively narrow, and the market had ample supplies, so it only rose by 15 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose steadily from 515 yuan to close at 532 yuan, resulting in an increase of 7 yuan. The 190 Shilin factory price approached the 1,000 yuan mark. Printed Bi Ji also opened high at 560 yuan. In the afternoon, the trend of each fabric continued to be strong. It was heard that Longtou fine cloth was trading at 550 yuan.</p>
<h3>Joint Purchasing Office Decides to Increase Cotton Purchase Quantity</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held a routine meeting yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun. After discussion, two urgent proposals were passed: (1) Strengthen the purchase of domestic cotton and increase the purchase quantity. It is now decided to purchase 1 million dan before the end of this year, doubling the original target of 500,000 dan. To date, the amount of domestic cotton purchased has exceeded the 300,000 dan mark. (2) Domestic cotton in various regions should be purchased and transported as it is purchased, and it should be transported to the location of the yarn factories as soon as possible to ensure the safety of the raw materials and maintain the work of each factory.</p>
<p>It is reported that domestic cotton in various regions is currently entering the market in large quantities, and it can be purchased in large quantities as long as there is sufficient capital. On average, purchasing 15,000 to 16,000 dan per day is not a problem. When funds are sufficient, purchasing 20,000 dan per day is also not difficult. It is heard that in addition to the original capital of 600 million yuan, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee will be provided with additional funds by the national banks as needed to supplement the raw cotton inventory.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Prices Rise Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market continued to move in a beautiful direction. The reason is that after the closure of customs in two days, exporters realized that the shipping schedule on the 25th of this month is approaching soon, so their willingness to act is more than in the past. The sellers insisted on the scarcity of production and inventory, and speculation became more rampant. Prices rose rapidly again, so the price increase, like bamboo shoots after rain, competed to grow rapidly. As for domestic sales of various grades, replenishment also occurred in the local market and elsewhere. The market atmosphere unanimously followed suit and rose.</p>

<h3>Legal Clarification: Problems of a Son-in-Law Inheritance</h3>
<p>[Mr. Liu Dehong asks] Dear Editor: A friend of mine is unmarried. Now [surname] has no children and plans to recruit a son-in-law to continue his lineage. I would be grateful if you could answer the following questions: (1) Can a son-in-law inherit his father-in-law's lineage? Are there any legal regulations? (2) If the female relative does not agree, can it take effect? (3) How should one deal with threats from female relatives?</p>
<p>[Zhao Pingfan, Tianjin, answers] (1) Recruiting a son-in-law is a custom in our country for thousands of years, and there are no regulations in law that prohibit it. (2) Recruiting a son-in-law does not require the consent of female relatives. Whether a son-in-law can inherit the property of his wife's family depends on the intention of the person being inherited. (3) Their direct relatives have no right to expel him. If there are threats or other circumstances, they can be prosecuted according to law.</p>

<h3>A Tragi-Comedy in Wuxi: Wedding Hall Burns Down, Guests Loot Amidst the Fire, Bridesmaid's Hair Singed</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 20th] Ni Jinsheng, a young man, is a wealthy resident of Dongting Changda Xia, inheriting a large amount of farmland and property from his ancestors. He also runs a successful lumber business there. Recently, through the introduction of his colleague Wei Genxiang, Ni married Zhao Yuying, a young female performer from the Yuanfeng Clay Figurine Shop on the road. Zhao is Wei's younger sister-in-law, in her early twenties, naturally beautiful, and deeply loved by Jinsheng. The 18th of this month was the auspicious day for the Ni and Zhao wedding. Ni, being financially comfortable, had already begun a large-scale banquet three days prior, inviting relatives and friends. The day itself was even more lively, with over a hundred tables of food and drink prepared. Unexpectedly, around 7 p.m., just as the wedding ceremony was taking place, two large red lanterns with the Ni surname and a potted plant symbolizing "A Thousand Years of Fortune" simultaneously went out and broke, astonishing all the guests. Suddenly, a fire broke out in the kitchen. At the time, all the cooks were in the hall watching the ceremony, in high spirits, so the fire spread rapidly. By the time it was discovered, it had already burst through the roof, making it impossible to extinguish. The hall immediately descended into chaos, with onlookers turning into firefighters. In the end, more than ten houses, including two halls, and five "longevity items" in the lumber yard's inner room were burned, resulting in considerable losses. What was even more ridiculous was that some onlookers took advantage of the fire to loot, stealing all of the bride's more than ten red and green new cotton quilts, leaving the bride and groom at a loss whether to laugh or cry. At the same time, Ding Muping, the daughter of the Yuanyuan Silver Shop in the city, who was a close friend of the bride and had been invited to the village to be a bridesmaid, had a strand of her hair singed by the fire, a close call.</p>

<p>[Our Pinghu Correspondent, 19th] Zheng Ziying, Wang Jipu, Gu Qingwei, and Zhou Guangshu, four students from the Spring Second Class B of the Provincial Jiaxing Normal School, are all from Dongyang. On the 17th, during a history lesson, the teacher Feng Yuancheng, because the semester was coming to an end, checked their notes and found that Zheng and the others had not taken any notes. He ordered them to complete them immediately, otherwise they would not be able to participate in the semester exams. However, Zheng and the others replied that they were responsible for the work of the school's dining group and had no time for this, which led to a dispute. Then, at midnight on the same day, Zheng and the others locked all the doors of the teachers' offices, sneaked into Feng's bedroom, stuffed his mouth with a towel, tied up his limbs, and beat him severely. Feng struggled desperately, which was heard by the neighboring room, who suspected a burglary. They tried to force open the door, but unexpectedly, it was locked from the outside. They then opened the window to investigate and saw Zheng and the others fleeing from Feng's bedroom. Seeing the situation of Feng's injuries, they reported it to Principal Liang. The next day, Zheng and the others were expelled from the school. The police station took the students to the station. The matter was criminal, and along with the towels, etc., they were sent to the local court on the 19th and were arrested.

The school sent the two students who caused the trouble to the police station. That night, all the students demanded that the police station release them. On the 14th, County Magistrate Cheng and Speaker Zhang went to the school to summon the students for instruction and approved the principal's resignation.
