<p>〔本報蚱埠十三日電〕蚱宿會戰今日仍以黃維兵團陣地爲重心，戰事在雙方每地必爭之狀態下慘烈進行中。國軍李兵團連日均有進展，匪爲避免黃李兩兵團會師後將遭圍殲之惡運計，除在北進李兵團當面堅强頑抵，作困獸之鬥外，劉匪復以全力猛撲黃兵團陣地，黃兵團孤軍浴血，昨晚復於變堆集以南擊潰其六縱隊一個團，陣地屹然未動；李兵團方面，昨日起在戰車之掩護攻擊下，對頑抗於包家集外圍之豆腐店據點之陳匪六縱隊一個團，加以圍剿，業於今晨二時攻克，殘匪千餘人全遭殲滅。今日此間天氣轉晴，銀翼部隊不斷出動作戰，5151型之重轟炸機羣更活躍於戰地上空，在此天公作美之下，李兵團今晨復乘勝東進，於午間攻佔包家集而造成南綫一重大進展。另部勁旅偏師奇出，今午後於雙溝集附近（懷遠西北約三十華里）擊潰匪某獨立團全部。李黃兩兵團之會師已屆一重要關頭，李兵團除左翼攻克包家集外，其右翼復以秋風掃葉之勢，神速進軍，溯澥河西進，今日連克姚莊·沈莊·三官廟等地，並向大王莊·陳集前進中，沿途似無大抵抗，前鋒與黃兵團陣地之距離已極有限，從順利方面言，固卽可能會師，惟當面之匪除原有之劉匪二·九兩縱隊，又陳匪六縱隊外，頃又以渤海縱歐增援此間，匪之阻碍行動，自亦爲意想中之事實。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕中立國軍事觀察家今日稱：黃維兵團在宿縣西北牽制之共軍至少有八萬人，此八萬人一旦移至澮河綫，則該綫國軍將吃重。目前澮河綫國軍第六與第八兩兵團實力爲八萬人左右，今後必須獲得增援，以抵抗共軍之擴大攻勢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕霍夫曼來滬二日，已定今日晋京，晋謁總統及其他政府官員，並定十五日在京乘美軍用機，直接飛漢城轉東京，預計將於十七日自東京飛返美，結束此次視察歐亞經合工作之旅程。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美經合總署署長霍夫曼氏，於昨日下午二時半，在此間美國總會一樓舉行記者招待會，美駐華大使司徒雷登，此間經合分署署長賴樸翰，副署長葛里芬等均出席，霍氏於賴樸翰致簡短之介紹詞後，以愉快之語調起立致詞略稱：此次應賴樸翰氏之堅邀來華，目的係搜集資料而非供給新聞，故或將使諸君失望，惟諸君如有問題，余當在可能範圍之內，儘量予以答覆。</p>
<p>答記者問</p>
<p>旋各外籍記者紛紛提出問題，焦點集中於萬一目前政局有所變動，經合總署之工作，是否亦將隨以調整。霍氏對此特再引證美國務卿馬歇爾氏，於一九四七年六月五日，在對哈佛大學之講詞中，對美經濟合作政策之基本概念。該項槪念有云：經合基本槪念之成立，並不係針對任何國家或主義，而係針對飢餓·貧困·混亂而出發，藉以恢復世界之經濟能力，維持自由之體制，使在該項體制下，愛好自由之人民能在保障自由之政府下存在並生活。由是以觀，果中國政局有所變動，則經合總署暫時祗能採取觀望能度，以決定其第二步之援華措置。</p>
<p>有記者問，何種方式之聯合政府，可使經合總署繼續其援華工作。霍氏表示此項問題，除牽涉政治部份，非渠所能置答外，惟在經濟之立塲言，所謂聯合政府，務必能眞正代表人民意旨，充份保障人民之自由，而該政府必須爲現有政府之合法繼承者，必待該項必備之性能確定後，始能考慮繼續援華之措置。目前國民政府仍爲唯一合法之政府，經合總署當仍以該政府及其人民爲經合署援助之對象。霍氏復表示：現階段經合署在華之援助工作，尙餘三個月卽將吿一段落。故此三個月中工作之開展，對未來之援華政策，當有決定性之影響。惟在此三個月中，經合署將視局勢之演展，對預定之援華程序，將作有效之支配。過此階段，則將另行考慮新對策。</p>
<p>復有記者問以在共黨政府下，經合署對純粹之救濟工作，是否可予繼續。霍氏表示純由共黨操縱之政府，卽單純之救濟工作，相信美政府亦難於允准。而此間經合署供應糧食之六大都市，設有任何一都市遭中共攻陷，而該新政權又未爲各國所承認前，經合署當不能與之訂定任何契豹，過渡期間勢將以提出備忘錄之方式，決定其後一應必要之措置。</p>
<p>對本年十一月份時滬市發生糧荒，上海經合分署向港府借米濟急，是否已超越經合署之職權一點，霍氏答稱：賴樸翰此種應急措置，在工作繁劇之際或不無稍越範圍，惟渠對賴氏能行此非常之舉，仍表贊許。最後霍賴兩氏復分別答覆若干零星問題，茲摘誌大要如次：（一）許多工業配件計劃仍在進行中，惟有長期性者，或其計劃之實施地點已不安全者，均已暫緩進行。（二）經合署來華船隻，迄未有裝載工業配件者，惟運糧之船隻仍將繼續來華，並不改調他用。（三）經合駐華分署在京滬之辦公處，刻仍在注意局勢之發展，並未考慮遷移。</p>

<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕保僑之美海軍陸戰隊，將於本周內乘美國遝輸艦倍菲爾號由靑島啓程來滬。但據本市美國海軍當局宣稱：啓程之命令尙未發出，故確切之日期尙未能獲悉。此次來滬之海軍陸戰隊人數，最高不致超過一千二百人。據可靠方面估計，人數當在八百人至一千人之間。蓋如由倍菲爾號載運一千二百人，船上必擁擠不堪。至將來如感不敷時，當由另一軍艦搭載第二批陸戰隊來滬。</p>

<p>潘議長向霍氏表示：目前切要之圖，卽爲保障並穩定中國在上海之經濟神經中樞，蓋中國百分之八十之工業活動，均已集中上海，設上海之經濟神經中樞能維持穩定，則長江以南未受戰事影饗之各區域，其經濟活動卽可賴以發展並吿穩定。故經濟援助工作，應注意於確保上海之安定。旋劉鴻生與章益等，亦相繼發言。</p>

<h3 id="c16">社論　日本戰犯的上訴問題 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>美國最高法院接受日戰犯廣田土肥原的「上訴」，預備覆審遠東國際軍事法庭判決的消息公佈後，舉世與論均表震驚。英國駐日盟管會代表蕭氏宣稱：美高法院這種措施，有損遠東法庭的地位；我國首席法官梅汝璈指出此舉實屬拖延政策，他認爲無損於法庭的判決。麥克阿瑟元帥雖命令暫緩執行七名日戰犯的絞刑，但他對此事發生的驚異，顯然不亞於其他盟國人士。據合衆社記者觀察這件事，最高法院顯不計劃判斷各戰犯的有罪或無罪；反之，旨在答覆兩項問題（一）最高法院有無審查判決書的權力？如有此項權力，則（二）遠東國際法庭是否由麥帥合法設立。從法理與事實來說，我們的答覆是否定的。我們應該據理抗議美國最高法院接受日戰犯的「上訴」。</p>
<p>第一·美高法院無權接受日戰犯的「上訴」，更無覆審國際法庭判決的權力。依美國憲法的規定，最高法院對美國軍隊設立的軍事法庭所爲的戰犯判決，幷無覆審之權。其立法主旨，在於表徵司法的純正，而不干涉軍法行政。日本並非美國的殖民地，而美國軍隊進駐日本，是執行盟國的佔領任務，美國駐日軍隊並無美國軍事法庭密判日本戰犯；美國與其他十個同盟國對於日本戰犯的審理，依波茨坦宣言和盟國協定，係委之於遠東國際軍事法庭。這個法庭不但名稱爲「國際」性，法庭組織的法官和檢察官，也由十一國指派全權代表主持，其組織幷不根據任何一國的國內法，完全係以國際法和先例作根據。美國法律不超於任何一盟國的法律，美國最高法院也不高於國際軍事法庭，因之，它的權力是不能損及國際軍事法庭所爲的任何判決。廣田土肥原向美高法庭提出「上訴」，是一種無恥的偷生心理；美高法院接受日戰犯的「上訴」，完全蔑視國際法及國際法庭。這是我們必須提出抗議的。</p>
<p>第二·遠東國際軍事法庭係盟軍總部設立，盟總並不干涉戰犯審理，國際法庭是獨立的合法的。如所週知，審判日戰犯並非美國一國作主的事，它是根據波茨坦宣言和盟國協定而成立的，麥帥在法律上是以一個盟軍統帥的地位，代表各國成立並執行這個法庭的成立，麥帥在行政上的上級，應該是十一國的遠東委員會。誠然，麥帥是美國人，其自身的行爲應受美國法律約束，可是，麥帥身任盟國駐日軍隊的統帥，其行政措施是對遠東委員會負責，而非對美國負責的。因此，盟總負責設立國際軍事法庭，是合法的措施；盟總覆核判決書予以原判執行，同樣是有法律根據的。我們有權利抗議美高法院接受日戰犯的「上訴」，同時有權利提出要求，盟總不接受任何干擾，迅速執行廣田土肥原東條等七名的紋刑，和木戶繁田等的無期徒刑，重光等的有期徒刑，以維國際軍事法庭的信譽。</p>
<p>美國的司法組織純正而開明，向爲舉世所尊重；一九四六年二月日駐菲司令山下奉文要求人身保護狀，美高法院概然予拒絕，深爲各國司法界所讚美。第二次世界大戰發生以來，美最高法院對盟軍和美軍的任何一樁軍法判決，完全保持客觀的態度，不予干涉或干擾，足徵美國司法界是崇向理性，尊重國際習慣的。這次竟突然接受日戰犯的「上訴」，眞是咄咄怪事，我們除了抗議這種違反法律，違背習慣的措施外，希望美最高法院作明智而純正的處斷，以免本案拖延情事。要之，本案的拖延即是正義的拖延，美國司法神聖，不應對正義公理怠工。這是我們的意見。</p>

<p>報吿存款兌換金銀情况</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕立院財金委會十三日午後舉行秘密會議，討論存款兌換金銀辦法，財長徐堪及國行總裁兪鴻鈞均應邀列席。下午三時許開會後，吳越潮主席卽請徐財長報吿存款兌換金銀政策執行之現况及展望，渠强調國庫存底雄厚，僅就黃金一項論，改革幣制後，國庫收兌者約一百八十餘萬兩，連舊存共達五百五十餘萬兩，今全國各地存兌者，尙不滿廿萬兩，故決不虞匱乏，然政府對疏導來源，亦並非全然置之不顧，目前正考慮兩事，（一）爲自美援中獲取一部份黃金，為自外國購進相當數量之金銀。財長並說明，對全國各地存兌技術諸待改進，加以黃牛黨作祟而引起之秩序欠佳與黑市猖獗等不良現象，政府已予注意。上週曾數度開會，商討改善辦法，然所討論者全係技術問題，外間所有謠傳，純屬空穴來風，政府對存兌政策極具信心，決澈底執行，以收吸收游資，穩定物價之效。繼由兪總裁說明國行辦理存兌以來之實際情况，對市場上大戶高價收買與黃牛黨　夜擠軋，作詳盡描述，渠稱：國行爲是項政策之執行機構，今後自將繼續努力改善手續，防制弊竇，以期使一般人民均能便利存款，以免財富集中於少數大戶與黃牛之從中牟利，擾亂金融。兪氏報吿畢，各委員相繼發言，綜合其共同意見，約有以下數點：（一）政府應注意金銀存量，是否可無限辦理存兌，隨時設法充實國庫。（二）若存兌政策可無限制繼續，則應長期施行，務期能戰勝根深蒂固之輕幣重金之一般社會病態心理，藉以挽回政府喪失已久之信用。（三）關於存兌技術，黃金十兩以上之大戶，須先塡具由購證，經核准後，方可存兌。十兩以下者，應儘力求其普遍，必要時，並可廣泛委託各商業銀行代辦。至公敎人員之存兌，應予便利一節，原則上應無問題，實際技術上如何辦法，則尙待研究。一部委員主張休假日專辦公敎人員存兌，但亦有擁擠之顧慮，一部委員建議，由各機關統籌代辦，但財部意見認爲，公敎人負少有餘資存兌，必不勝親友相煩，變爲特殊黃牛，至于發薪時以一部辦理存兌折發銀元之辦法，復恐涉及工資問題，亦需愼重考慮，會末，徐·兪兩氏對各委員提出之意見，深致謝意，至五時半散會。</p>

<p>茲再探誌霍氏昨日所發表之書面談話如次：</p>
<p>余今茲蒞臨中國，時間雖甚短促，衷心殊感愉快，余對於中國及中國人民雖歷年來久感關切，且在此余亦有甚多中國友人，然此番來華，尙爲畢生第一次之機會，因此當去年十月間，賴撲翰君建議本人來華作一度實地觀察時，余因已不待敦促而首肯矣。</p>
<p>當初余固望首次蒞華，可以暇逸出之，不圖此次旅行時間急迫，且幾全爲公務所羈，頗覺遺憾。雖然自另一方面言，此行攸關經合署經濟援助計劃，其目的在支持與補助中國人民健全其國家經濟地位之努力，則使余甚感忻幸。當余離華盛頓前夕，與杜魯門總統晤談時，總統特諄囑在美國對於中國人民之悠久而綿賡的友誼一點上，務須致意，蓋友誼，互敬及共同旨趣，素爲中美關係之磐石，且迄今仍爲美國政策之基礎也。</p>
<p>余訪華之目的，並非在決定或闡示美國對華之政策，因在解決該政策所包含之錯綜複雜的與軍事政治問題上，余固無此資格與權力也，經合署之任務，僅爲執行總統與國會所通過之經濟計劃，吾人在軍事援助之獲取或執行上，並不負責。</p>
<p>吾人目前之任務，乃在盡量利用今次援助計劃尙未撥用之款項，並使任何關於未來計劃向國會所提之建議，可能成爲健全而完善者，至於基本政策，則須由國會決定之。</p>
<p>今得此機會，目覩經合署中國計劃之若干工作狀况及其問題，深感滿意而具啓迪之意義，萬里外之電文報吿，無論如何準確，尙不能抵極其短促之實地視察也</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎十二日電〕歷時十二星期之聯合國巴黎大會終於今夜閉幕。閉會前以四十八票對六票通過中美澳三國之韓國問題提案，僅蘇聯集團投反對票，瑞典棄權。大會原定昨夜閉幕，但因蘇聯代表馬立克採取拖延戰略，妨碍韓國問題之表決，以致延長會議一日。星期日午後會議時馬立克猶曉曉抨擊美韓兩國不休，但各代表已無意辯論。有人謂西方國家代表曾採取「靜默戰略」，强迫休會。馬氏最後要求大會表決蘇聯所提結束朝鮮委員會工作之提案，結果以四十六對六票被否決，大會通過之中美澳提案內容爲：（一）承認朝鮮委員會之工作。（二）承認在聯合國代表團監督下選出韓國政府爲合法政府。（三）建議美蘇兩國佔領軍在可能範圍內儘速自韓國撤退。（四）命朝鮮委員會繼續一作一年，設法促成南北韓之統一。（五）命朝鮮委員會於佔領軍撤退時，祖任監督。大會又通過加拿大修正案，將朝鮮委員會建議以七國常任委會替代目前之九國臨時委會。加代表稱，目前之九國委會包括中·法·澳·加·印·菲·薩爾瓦多·叙利亞與烏克蘭，而烏克蘭則向未出席，故實際上僅八國，致使表決重要決議時發生困難。故加拿大要求退出，使之成爲七國委會。</p>

<h3 id="c80">貼放會通過收購成品辦法　國行開始辦理工貸　工業界認為貸款利率太高 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行貼放委員會昨起正式辦理緊急工貸，所有申請表冊，該會已分別送交國家行局及商業行莊。上週六各工廠已直接向貼放會申請，該會迄今已發出申請書達千份。貼放會收到各廠商之申請後，卽分別交由貿易工礦農業三顧問委員會審查，加具審查意見，再提請貼放會作最後核定。貼放會昨曾開會，通過申請案數起，關於收購成品之詳細辦法，亦經該會訂定如後：</p>
<p>（一）辦理收購成品案件，應核明其成品在短期內銷路不暢，其事業應予維持者爲限，（二）收購之對象應以下列物品爲限：（甲）日用必需品：棉織品皮革，紙張，肥皂，火柴，藥材，（乙）基本工礦事業，鋼鐵，水泥，機器，煤，（丙）其他工礦特產，合乎收購案件者。（三）收購之數量，應以不超過每一廠商過去六個月中之平均月產量爲限，（四）收購成品案件經核定後，卽通知本行業務局墊款委託各行局庫，就專業範圍內分別或聯合舉辦，（五）甲請廠商應依照規定，塡送各該資料，以備審核，（六）收購成品價格及騐收交貨之手續，照下列規定辦理：（甲）收購價格以訂約前六日平均市價爲準，（乙）受託行局收購合約訂立後，卽行騐收成品支付貨款，騐收完竣，卽與央行辦理移轉手續，並將有關倉單支付央行核收。（七）收購成品之處理，以標售爲原則，由央行隨時委託有關機關辦理，並酌給手續費，（八）收買成品照第七條規定處理後，其所得價款，應隨時解交央行，收回墊款。</p>
<p>又此次工貸之辦理，當局力主嚴格審查，以免資金流入投機市塲而致刺激物價；而在工業界方面，則對現行辦法亦不滿意，首先認爲貸款利率太高，工廠難於負担；其次爲收購成品之作價，以前六日之平均價格爲準，實嫌過低，因目前工業成品之價格，大多已在成本之下云。</p>

<p>頃自進出口業方面獲悉，自進出口連鎖制實施以來，出口業務，一度曾呈現欣欣向榮之勢。惟迄至目前，是項現象，又復重趨消沉。此中原因，一爲因國內時局關係，運輸困難，出口貨品成本激增。二爲外匯移轉證價格雖已漸趨好轉，惟去化仍未達理想階段，且其價格，與實際仍有極大距離云。</p>

<h3 id="c91">「燈盡油」寄感慨　陳布雷先生之於杭州 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生本報特派員</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十二日訊〕卅七年初秋，布雷先生曾來海寗觀潮，順道來杭遊覽，當時我去海寗迎先生，由海寗來杭途中，我和先生同一車，他爲我道說杭州的史實甚多。布雷先生十多歲到杭州求學，他說那時滬杭鐵路尙未興築，去滬時須循拱宸橋運河道而行，當無現在的寬闊馬路和新型建築。</p>
<p>杭城夢憶</p>
<p>布雷先生又笑着說：「當年讀書時，菜館以聚豐園最著名，我們學生不大上聚豐園，如到聚豐園，則爲盛宴，如學生們集資宴老師，則在聚豐園。現在有名的館子已有好幾爿了。」</p>
<p>布雷先生又爲我道昔年長浙敎廳時寓於小運莊，離浙時對杭州每多懷念。某年冬，他曾獨自來杭，至新新旅館，要一面湖而光綫充足之房間，閉門寫作。旅館主人不知布雷先生何事，甚奇之，殊不知此當年震動全國之文章，乃產於西子湖上。</p>
<p>遊山追記</p>
<p>布雷先生對湖上諸勝均能歷歷道之，車中嘗問我月下老人祠現尙健在否？去南山下午，我曾伴遊白雲庵，先生求一籤，同往諸人均得籤語。出門時見一對時髦男女挽手而進，我說：「這是一對愛人。」布雷先生笑向我道；「此乃還願而來也。」出庵門後，我返庵內觀之，果見紅燭高燒，雙雙禮拜。</p>
<p>北山之遊，同行者王福淸先生創爬山翻越峯嶺至上天竺之議，我們多恐先生伉儷過於勞累，擬代雇肩與，先生不許，遂翻往上天竺。時天時尙熱，溫度約在九十度左右，先生竟未感疲憊。後又車往雲棲，先生見齊魯大學學生跋踄來杭，頗寄同情。出大殿時，見一學生埋頭功課，猶昵視良久，並對我慨然曰：「現時讀書亦不得安靜，眞亦不容易也。」</p>
<p>病有轉機</p>
<p>先生在杭四日中，對公務每多牽掛，常竊竊自語曰：「工作緊張，我還在此間偸閒遊山水。」我們都勸他暫時放開些。</p>
<p>我曾和先生談杭州應作理想文化城之建設，先生極表贊同，他說：「杭州有一個寗靜的環境，可以寫作。」他又對我說：「新聞記者人緣要好，腦筋要靈敏，筆要快，手，脚，眼等都要快」</p>
<p>先生返滬後，於去南京時，曾寄我一函，云：「…此次作海寗杭州之游，流連四日，接觸大自然壯美之景色，使賤恙頓有轉機，不勝快慰。……」</p>
<p>書生本色</p>
<p>誠如布雷先生所言，在這杭遊四日中，眞是「晨夕與共」。在「晨夕與共」中，我感覺布雷先生對事業則敬，對朋友則愛，對自己則特別克苦。他遊杭時住在裏西湖一個莊子上，這莊子沒有什麼名氣，棕棚床，設備也極爲簡陋，而布雷先生竟能酣睡數夜。他吃飯時並不點什麼名菜，什麼菜拿來都能下嚥，他在杭的穿着，始終是一頂舊呢帽，一件褪了色的栗色綢大衫。他一生都極爲謹嚴自持，保持着書生本色，在現時這個環境中，書生氣的讀書人，那裏還找得着呢？</p>
<p>湖山長眠</p>
<p>布雷先生看杭州繁興，所以他特別喜愛杭州，關切杭州。遊杭以後，在杭州得獲着的愉快竟使他病有轉機，如果能給以相當的時日，在杭州休息一段時間，則也許不致會遭逢這一回悽惻的變故。</p>
<p>中國有很多有學問的人，他自己爲了要保養着書生本色，而社會也疏於注意而竟犧牲了。布雷先生雖臨終遺書中有「燈盡油枯」之語，但是爲什麼會「燈盡油枯」？爲什麼旣知油將枯，燈將盡，而猶不加一些「油」剪一剪「燈心」，使他復趨於光明呢？</p>
<p>布雷先生遺書中囑薄殮薄葬於南京近郊，而先生家人深知先生生時熱愛杭州，曾在當年與友人合購山地於徐村，先生並有意營屋養老，後因無力建屋，久久未償其願。現在把他安葬在杭州，使他長眠在這山水？間，永遠他安息。</p>
<p>先生去矣！感到空洞虛無，　像這充分代表中國書生傳統的先生去矣！好像留下了一個很大的問題等待着我們去尋求解決。</p>

<p>— 本報戰地記者　楊冰生</p>
<p>〔本報唐山八日航訊〕華北現局勢下，開灤礦區的安全，全國人士都在關心着，尤其是東北撤守，林彪部入關後，唐山地處華北最前哨，平津唐形成互爲犄角形勢，遂成了華北唯一軍事重鎭，冀東大戰中的第一個爭奪點。</p>
<p>記者五日由北平來唐，沿北寗綫東進。平唐間大小車站，莫不擠滿了兵車及軍用物資，一列列東調西開的軍車，給予了人們以充份的緊張情緖。</p>
<p>平唐間僅需六小時到達的急行車，因了沿綫軍用加車太多，站站停滯，却耗費了十二個小時的功夫。</p>
<p>下火車步入市區，首先接觸到眼內的是「街巷堡壘」，舉凡重要地區及鬧市的十字路口上，都修蓋好了一座洋灰石板高出地面五尺的碉堡。</p>
<p>秦榆撤守，灤河鐵橋炸毀，却造成了唐山市表面上的繁榮。唐東各地的軍政公敎人員·及難民，刻多西集唐市。地狹人稠，房荒嚴重，全市三十餘家大小飯店旅館，均有人滿患。</p>
<p>唐市的商號，上月份增業的就有六十一家之多。商會婦女會，都在搬演着改選競選的鬧劇。此外，開灤礦生產不輟等等均給予了當地居民一付良好的鎭靜劑。目前全市人口已突破二十萬，以是冀東各縣游資襲唐，物資來源阻斷，致使物價高昂。</p>
<p>但是此間有上帝獨賜的優渥享受，是煤價低廉，因此電源充足。　再透視一下唐山社會的內層，交大早已南遷了，啓新洋灰公司卽將被迫停工，灤煤外運不暢，存儲日增，貧難民的慘象，紳商大賈的西遷，大風暴將臨的惶恐，時時刻刻關懷着的津唐路安全，交織成唐山社會的明暗面。</p>
<p>爲了保衛唐山，發揮總體戰的力量，華北軍當局除針對冀東現勢已作萬全佈署外，此間軍方規定了幾點戰時緊急措置：（一）無必要居住市區人民可自動疏散，（二）市民應儲水幷購存半月以上食糧，（三）一切配合軍事澈底遵行戒嚴命令，（四）規定宵禁，匪警，戰鬥等警報信號。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Active Air Force·Powerful Tanks: National Army Continues Advance on the Bengbu-Suxian Southern Front; Li-Huang Corps' Distance Extremely Limited <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Zhazhaopu, 13th] Today's battle of Zhaxian-Suxian continues to focus on the positions of the Huang Wei Corps, with fierce fighting occurring as both sides contest every inch of ground. The National Army's Li Corps has made continuous progress in recent days. To avoid the misfortune of being encircled and annihilated after the Huang and Li Corps join forces, the communist bandits, in addition to putting up a stubborn and desperate resistance against the advancing Li Corps in the north, have also launched an all-out assault on the positions of the Huang Corps. The Huang Corps, fighting a bloody battle in isolation, yesterday again routed a regiment of their 6th Column south of Biandui Settlement, and their positions remain unmoved. On the Li Corps side, under the cover of tanks, an attack was launched yesterday to encircle and annihilate a regiment of the Chen bandit's 6th Column, which was stubbornly resisting around the Doufudian stronghold outside Baojia Settlement. It was captured at 2:00 AM this morning, and over a thousand remaining bandits were completely wiped out. The weather here turned sunny today, and the silver-winged forces are constantly sortieing into battle. The 5151-type heavy bomber squadrons are even more active over the battlefield. With the weather cooperating, the Li Corps resumed its eastward advance this morning, taking advantage of the victory to capture Baojia Settlement at noon, creating a major advance on the southern front. Another elite force made a surprise attack and completely annihilated a certain independent regiment of the bandits near Shuang Gou Settlement (about thirty li northwest of Huaiyuan) this afternoon. The meeting of the Li and Huang Corps is approaching a crucial moment. In addition to capturing Baojia Settlement on its left flank, the Li Corps' right flank is also advancing rapidly like an autumn wind sweeping away leaves, advancing west along the Xie River, capturing Yaozhuang, Shenzhuang, Sanguanmiao, and other places in succession today, and advancing towards Dawangzhuang and Chenji Settlement. There seems to be no major resistance along the way, and the distance between the vanguard and the positions of the Huang Corps is extremely limited. From a smooth perspective, a meeting may occur immediately. However, in addition to the original 2nd and 9th Columns of the Liu bandits, and the 6th Column of the Chen bandits, the Bohai Column has now been used to reinforce this area. The bandits' obstruction efforts are, of course, an expected fact.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Bengbu, 13th] It is reported that Liu Bocheng's headquarters is located at Buzhuang, fifty li east of Suxian. Also, there are often more than ten thousand civilian laborers in the Henan-Anhui border area, who are coerced by the bandits and assigned to transportation work.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 13th] Lieutenant Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo led a powerful armored unit, together with certain powerful units of the National Army, and captured many important strongholds near Baojia Settlement and Chenji Settlement this afternoon. The entire 17th Regiment of the Bandit 11th Division was annihilated, and more than six hundred prisoners were captured alive.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] Well-informed sources said on the evening of the 13th that the communist army has been attacking the Xuzhou-Bengbu area for more than a month. Due to heavy losses, they have had to use poorly trained militiamen and captured soldiers of the National Army to fight on the front lines. It was also said that the communist army attacks more frequently than the National Army, while the National Army has high walls and deep trenches to defend, so the communist army's losses are far greater than those of the National Army. They also believe that the communist army may abandon the Xuzhou-Bengbu offensive and wait until next spring to make another move.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Neutral military observers said today that the communist army tied down by the Huang Wei Corps northwest of Suxian is at least 80,000 men. Once these 80,000 men are moved to the Huai River line, the National Army on that line will be under heavy pressure. Currently, the 6th and 8th Corps of the National Army on the Huai River line have a strength of about 80,000 men, and must obtain reinforcements in the future to resist the communist army's expanded offensive.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] In recent days, when civilian aircraft have been supplying ammunition to the National Army north of Bengbu by air, they have sometimes been hit by communist underground artillery fire, and some aircraft bodies have been hit by bullets. It is learned that the National Army's fighter squadron has been strafing with machine guns near the aerial supply area to eliminate the danger when civilian aircraft drop supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 13th] The railway near Guandian, which was damaged on the evening of the 12th, was completely repaired on the morning of the 13th. Passenger and freight trains between Bengbu and Pukou are running smoothly. The Beijing-Shanghai Comfort Mission also changed to boarding the train and returning south at 10:00 AM today.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Bengbu, 13th] After Deng Wenyi finished his official business in Bengbu, Liu Zhi had important matters to request instructions on, and took a special plane to Beijing overnight this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Lin Biao's Troops Move En Masse into Shanhaiguan Pass: National Army Determined to Defend Beiping and Tianjin; Garrison in Tangshan Withdraws from City, Causing Chaos <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced today that the garrison in Tangshan and staff of various agencies took the initiative to withdraw from Tangshan City on the afternoon of the 12th. No fighting occurred, and all personnel and public property have safely arrived at the planned area.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The National Army in Tangshan took the initiative to withdraw. An emergency alarm was issued in Tangshan City on the morning of the 12th, and everyone felt panicked. The city was in chaos, and military, government, education personnel, and refugees all rushed to the train station. The highest military commander stationed in Tangshan then dispatched all eight train cars at the station, preparing to open them south. At the same time, trains full of refugees also arrived from Guye, east of Tangshan. The order at the station was extremely chaotic, with people desperately fighting to get on each train. At 12:00, communist hidden agents were active in the city, and there were many cases of looting materials. At 2:30, the command car of the highest military person in charge was the first to leave Tangshan. The roofs and doors of each train were crowded with refugees, and some were hit by the bridge top and fell into the river. The situation was extremely tragic. All the trains that have left Tangshan have safely arrived in the Tianjin-Tanggu area.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] This morning at 7:00, the Tianjin Kailuan General Bureau still had telecommunications contact with the Kailuan Mining Company in Tangshan, but then the connection was lost. Currently, in addition to the chief of Kailuan Mining being stranded in Beiping, most of the other senior officers have not left Tangshan. The current chief engineer of the Tangshan mining area, De Flange, is in charge of everything. Defenses between Tanggu and Lutai in northeastern Tianjin have been strengthened.</p>
<p>Spokesman of the Pacification Headquarters Speaks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The spokesman of the North China Pacification Headquarters recently issued a statement on the current military situation, saying: Lin Biao's bandit troops moved en masse into Shanhaiguan Pass and are advancing towards Beiping and Tianjin. In order to coordinate the overall situation, the National Army reluctantly withdrew from some strongholds. Zhangjiakou originally planned to withdraw according to plan, but the people of Zhangjiakou feared a cruel massacre and, with tears in their eyes, refused to let the National Army leave. Forced by circumstances, a part of the National Army was stationed in Zhangjiakou. We will firmly defend both Beiping and Tianjin, one being a cultural ancient capital and the other being an industrial base. Neither should be subjected to any destruction or damage. Therefore, we will do everything possible to properly protect the cultural relics and historical sites of Beiping and the industrial equipment of Tianjin. But since it is a city defense, the compatriots in the city will inevitably experience some suffering in their lives and spirits. This is the encounter of China's suffering destiny, which is truly unavoidable. On the one hand, we are willing to do our best to assist in life. We have absolute confidence in firmly defending. We hope that our compatriots will be patient and calm, and ensure order and security in the city.</p>

Sandbags have been piled up at the gates of the city, barbed wire has been erected, and fortifications have been built around the city. The troops guarding the Xiyuan Airport have all entered their fortifications. Airplanes land, unload, and immediately take off, which is very tense.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Martial law has been declared in the western suburbs of Beiping starting from the afternoon of the 13th. The Agricultural College of Peking University has moved into the city, and many Yenching University students have also entered the city.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Tsinghua University in the western suburbs of Beiping has taken on a wartime appearance. In the northern battle last night, two shells landed in Tsinghua Garden. Today, students are successively entering the city, reaching four-tenths of the total. President Mei Yi-qi has also entered the city.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The Pacification Headquarters announced: At 2:00 PM on the 12th, a group of more than a thousand stray bandits窜到 near Zhenggezhuang, east of Shahe, north of Beiping. Strong units of the National Army counterattacked. After a night of fierce fighting, due to the major pressure on the northern front of the National Army, the bandits were forced to retreat south. At about 2:00 PM on the 13th, the bandits were lured to the Madouzhuang and Banbidian area between Qinghe and Shahe. The National Army ambushed from the north and south, and after two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and fled northwest. The National Army is currently tracking and pursuing them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced at 11:00 PM on the 13th: In the fierce battle in Qinghe at noon on the 13th, the National Army inflicted a heavy blow on the Lin bandits and achieved an initial victory.

The National Army gave the bandits a head-on blow and launched a fierce battle in the Qinghe area. From morning to dusk, the sound of artillery boomed.

<p>Believes Future of the War Situation Can Definitely Be Optimistic</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Central Committee of the Kuomintang held a memorial week this morning, chaired by Li Zongren. Gu Zhutong, Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on recent military affairs, outlining the recent situation of each battlefield. Gu expressed optimism about the future of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. He said: In this Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the communist bandits have attacked en masse, which is giving our army an opportunity to annihilate them completely. In the past, our army has repeatedly sought but could not get an opportunity to fight a decisive battle with the main force of the communist bandits. Now, our northern and southern corps are jointly attacking the main force of the communist bandits. Another route of our army is also successively reinforcing the front line. I believe the future of the war situation can definitely be optimistic.</p>

<p>Bandit Troops Gathered in Northern Hubei</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Xi'an, 13th] The bandits in the triangular area between the Luohe River and the Yellow River have been frequently moving in recent days. Currently, four columns have gathered near Hanyang, and there are signs of plotting disturbances.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Chongqing, 13th] The movements of the bandits in northern Hubei are extremely noteworthy. Bandit leader Kong Congzhou has concentrated the 15th, 16th, 28th, 44th, and 61st Brigades in two units (Tanxi and [missing text] County). The 24th and 41st Brigades crossed the Han River. The 24th and 41st Brigades are occupying Shiyan Town, confronting the National Army, and the 14th Brigade of Jun County is staying in Caodian.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Hoffman Hosts Reporters in Muddy Pond, Explains Future Policies of Economic Cooperation, Visiting the President in Beijing Today and Flying to Tokyo Tomorrow <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Hoffman has decided to visit Beijing today, two days after arriving in Shanghai, to visit the President and other government officials. He is scheduled to take a US military plane in Beijing on the 15th and fly directly to Seoul and then to Tokyo. He is expected to fly back to the United States from Tokyo on the 17th, ending his trip to inspect the Economic Cooperation work in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Hoffman, Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, held a press conference at 2:30 PM yesterday on the first floor of the American Club here. US Ambassador to China Stuart Lei, the head of the ECA branch here, John R. Lapham, and Deputy Director Griffin all attended. After Lapham gave a brief introduction, Hoffman stood up and addressed the audience in a pleasant tone, saying: I was strongly invited by Mr. Lapham to come to China, and the purpose is to collect information rather than provide news, so I may disappoint you. However, if you have any questions, I will try my best to answer them within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>Answering Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Then, foreign reporters asked questions one after another. The focus was on whether the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration would also be adjusted if the current political situation changes. In response, Hoffman specifically quoted US Secretary of State Marshall's speech to Harvard University on June 5, 1947, on the basic concept of the US economic cooperation policy. That concept stated: The establishment of the basic concept of economic cooperation is not directed at any country or ideology, but starts from hunger, poverty, and chaos, in order to restore the world's economic capacity, maintain a free system, and enable free-loving people to exist and live under a government that guarantees freedom under that system. From this point of view, if the political situation in China changes, the Economic Cooperation Administration can only temporarily take a wait-and-see attitude to decide on its second step of aid to China measures.</p>
<p>A reporter asked, what kind of coalition government would allow the Economic Cooperation Administration to continue its aid to China work? Hoffman said that this question, in addition to involving political issues that he could not answer, only in terms of the economic position, the so-called coalition government must be able to truly represent the people's will, fully protect the people's freedom, and the government must be the legitimate successor of the existing government. The measures to continue aid to China can only be considered after the necessary performance is confirmed. The current National Government is still the only legitimate government, and the Economic Cooperation Administration will still target that government and its people as the object of ECA's assistance. Hoffman also stated that the current phase of the Economic Cooperation Administration's assistance work in China has only three months left before it comes to an end. Therefore, the development of work in these three months will have a decisive impact on the future aid to China policy. However, in these three months, the Economic Cooperation Administration will, depending on the development of the situation, effectively allocate the scheduled aid to China procedures. After this stage, new countermeasures will be considered separately.</p>
<p>Another reporter asked whether the Economic Cooperation Administration could continue to provide purely relief work under a communist government. Hoffman said that it would be difficult for the US government to approve a government solely controlled by the Communist Party, even for pure relief work. If any of the six major cities in Shanghai where the Economic Cooperation Administration supplies food is captured by the Chinese Communist Party, and the new regime has not been recognized by various countries, the Economic Cooperation Administration will not be able to sign any contracts with it. During the transition period, it will inevitably use the method of submitting a memorandum to determine the necessary measures afterwards.</p>
<p>Regarding the point that the Shanghai Economic Cooperation Administration borrowed rice from the Hong Kong government to relieve the food shortage in Shanghai in November of this year, whether it has exceeded the authority of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman replied: Lapham's emergency measures may have slightly exceeded the scope during busy work, but he still expressed his approval of Lapham's ability to take this extraordinary move. Finally, Hoffman and Lapham respectively answered some sporadic questions, the main points of which are summarized as follows: (1) Many industrial component plans are still in progress, but those with a long-term nature, or whose implementation location is already unsafe, have been temporarily suspended. (2) Economic Cooperation Administration ships to China have not yet loaded industrial components, but ships transporting grain will continue to come to China and will not be transferred to other uses. (3) The Economic Cooperation Administration's offices in Beijing and Shanghai are still paying attention to the development of the situation and have not considered moving.</p>

<p>US Marines Will Land if Necessary</p>
<p>[Report from this city] Speaker Pan visited Brigadier General Barr at the Broadway Mansion at 3:30 PM yesterday to extend his regards on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, explaining that all circles in the city support the head of state and strive for self-defense, and plan to organize a merchant corps to cooperate with the police to maintain order. The business community has a long-standing business relationship with foreign expatriates in Shanghai and hopes to obtain close cooperation in maintaining local order. Brigadier General Barr stated that he would order the Marine Corps to land if necessary in order to fulfill his responsibility to protect overseas Chinese. The conversation between the two was very pleasant, and they shook hands and said goodbye at 4:45.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Qingdao, 13th] The aircraft carrier and other ships of the US 38th Special Mixed Fleet gradually left Qingdao Port this morning. Their destination is unknown, but it is rumored to be Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Report from this city] The US Marines, who protect overseas Chinese, will depart from Qingdao for Shanghai on the American transport ship "Peified" this week. However, according to the US naval authorities in this city, the order to depart has not yet been issued, so the exact date is still unknown. The number of Marines coming to Shanghai this time will not exceed 1,200 at most. According to reliable estimates, the number will be between 800 and 1,000. If the "Peified" carries 1,200 people, the ship will be extremely crowded. If it is insufficient in the future, another warship will carry the second batch of Marines to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Barr arrived in this city again from Qingdao on the morning of the 13th and will fly back to Qingdao on the 14th.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Leaders from all circles in this city, arranged by Speaker Pan, went to the Economic Cooperation Administration's office here yesterday morning to meet with Mr. Hoffman and exchange private opinions. Participants included Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Cheng Cangbo, Zhang Yi, Zhao Dihua, Xu Guomao, Hu Dunfu, Xu Xinyu, Xu Kejun, and more than a dozen others.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan told Hoffman that the current important plan is to protect and stabilize China's economic nerve center in Shanghai. 80% of China's industrial activities have been concentrated in Shanghai. If Shanghai's economic nerve center can maintain stability, the economic activities of various regions south of the Yangtze River that have not been affected by the war can rely on it for development and stability. Therefore, economic assistance work should pay attention to ensuring the stability of Shanghai. Liu Hongsheng and Zhang Yi also spoke in succession.</p>
<p>In addition to expressing that the United States will continue to maintain friendship with China and its people, Hoffman pointed out that his main job is to instruct and implement economic assistance plans, and that aid to China work still occupies an important part of the Economic Cooperation Administration's work.</p>
<p>Hoffman was invited to a banquet by the directors of the American Chamber of Commerce at noon. At 5:00 PM, Lapham held a reception at the American Club to welcome Hoffman. Many leaders and people from all walks of life in this city attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Li Ming, Zhang Jiaao, Zhang Yujiu, and Shou Jingwei. In a harmonious atmosphere, they exchanged opinions with the distinguished guest who came from afar. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00. Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the US Aid Utilization Committee, was ordered to come to Shanghai to welcome Hoffman and took a car back to Beijing at 11:00 PM on the 13th.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Jiangdu, 12th] Reliable news: The war in northern Jiangsu is developing smoothly. (1) The National Army on the Yang(zhou)-Tian(chang) line began to launch a western offensive on the night of the 12th, with the momentum of breaking bamboo. Within 20 hours, it successively recovered strongholds such as Gongdao Bridge, Gouquanshan, and Yangjiamiao. The vanguard has crossed Dayi Settlement (sixty li west of Yangzhou City) tonight. The remaining bandits fled to Gaoyou Lake and the surrounding areas of Tianchang. The Yang-Tian Highway can be opened up.

<p>Denies That Shaanxi Provincial Government Will Move to Hanzhong</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper, Xi'an, 13th] Dong Zhao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, analyzed the current situation at the provincial government's monthly meeting today, saying: There is absolutely no problem with stabilizing Guanzhong, because the National Army's strength is several times that of the bandits. Currently, the National Army has twelve reorganized divisions in Guanzhong, at least 250,000 mobile troops. Together with artillery and mechanized units, and local teams, the total can reach 400,000 to 500,000. The bandit Peng in northern Shaanxi has only five columns. After several losses, broken soldiers and remnants are at most only 120,000 people. The huge difference can be seen. Dong hoped that everyone would stabilize their hearts and not be confused by some temporary phenomena. The Shaanxi Southern Shaanxi Inspection Group of the Provincial Government has set off today. Chairman Dong told reporters today that rumors that the Provincial Government is preparing to move to Hanzhong are absolutely untrue.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Editorial: The Issue of Appeals by Japanese War Criminals <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The announcement that the U.S. Supreme Court has accepted the "appeals" of Japanese war criminals Hirota and Doihara and is preparing to review the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East has shocked world opinion. British representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Mr. Shaw, declared that this action by the U.S. Supreme Court damages the standing of the Far East Tribunal. Our country's chief judge, Mei Ru'ao, pointed out that this move is merely a delaying tactic and believes it will not undermine the Tribunal's judgments. Although General MacArthur has ordered a stay of execution for the seven Japanese war criminals sentenced to hang, his surprise at this development is clearly no less than that of other Allied nations. According to a United Press reporter's observation, the Supreme Court apparently does not plan to judge the guilt or innocence of the war criminals; rather, it aims to answer two questions: (1) Does the Supreme Court have the authority to review the judgments? If it has this authority, then (2) Was the International Military Tribunal for the Far East lawfully established by MacArthur? In terms of both legal principle and fact, our answer is no. We should protest the U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the "appeals" of the Japanese war criminals based on reason.</p>
<p>First, the U.S. Supreme Court has no right to accept the "appeals" of Japanese war criminals, let alone review the judgments of the international tribunal. According to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has no power to review war criminal judgments made by military tribunals established by the U.S. military. The legislative aim of this is to demonstrate the purity of the judiciary and not to interfere with military justice administration. Japan is not a colony of the United States, and the U.S. military's presence in Japan is to carry out the Allied occupation mission. The U.S. military in Japan did not secretly try Japanese war criminals in U.S. military tribunals. The trial of Japanese war criminals by the United States and ten other Allied nations, according to the Potsdam Declaration and Allied agreements, was entrusted to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. This tribunal is not only "international" in name, but the judges and prosecutors of the tribunal's organization are also appointed by plenipotentiary representatives of eleven countries. Its organization is not based on the domestic law of any one country but entirely on international law and precedent. U.S. law does not supersede the law of any Allied nation, and the U.S. Supreme Court is not superior to the International Military Tribunal. Therefore, its power cannot undermine any judgment made by the International Military Tribunal. Hirota and Doihara's filing of an "appeal" to the U.S. Supreme Court is a shameless attempt to prolong their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the Japanese war criminals' "appeal" completely disregards international law and international tribunals. This is something we must protest.</p>
<p>Second, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East was established by the Allied Headquarters. The Allied Headquarters does not interfere with the trial of war criminals, and the international tribunal is independent and lawful. As is well known, the trial of Japanese war criminals is not a matter decided by the United States alone. It was established according to the Potsdam Declaration and Allied agreements. MacArthur, in law, held the position of an Allied commander, representing various countries in establishing and executing this tribunal's establishment. MacArthur's superior in administrative matters should be the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. Of course, MacArthur is an American, and his actions are bound by U.S. law. However, MacArthur serves as the commander of the Allied forces stationed in Japan, and his administrative measures are accountable to the Far Eastern Commission, not to the United States. Therefore, the Allied Headquarters' responsibility for establishing the International Military Tribunal is a lawful measure. The Allied Headquarters' review of the judgments and execution of the original sentences is similarly based on law. We have the right to protest the U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the Japanese war criminals' "appeal," and we also have the right to demand that the Allied Headquarters not accept any interference and promptly execute the death sentences of Hirota, Doihara, Tojo, and the other seven, as well as the life sentences of Kido and Shigemitsu, and the fixed-term imprisonments of others, to maintain the credibility of the International Military Tribunal.</p>
<p>The judicial organization of the United States is pure and enlightened and has always been respected by the world. In February 1946, when Japanese Commander in the Philippines Yamashita Tomoyuki requested a writ of habeas corpus, the U.S. Supreme Court summarily refused, which was praised by the legal communities of various countries. Since the outbreak of World War II, the U.S. Supreme Court has maintained a completely objective attitude toward any military law judgments made by the Allied forces and the U.S. military, refraining from interference or disruption, which is sufficient to show that the U.S. judicial community admires reason and respects international custom. This sudden acceptance of the "appeals" of Japanese war criminals is truly a strange and disturbing matter. In addition to protesting this measure that violates the law and goes against custom, we hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will make a wise and pure judgment to avoid delaying the case. In short, the delay of this case is the delay of justice. The sacredness of the U.S. judiciary should not neglect justice and public reason. This is our opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Improving Measures for Depositing and Exchanging Gold and Silver; Decision to Submit to the Executive Yuan for Discussion; Authorities Not Considering Adjusting Gold Prices <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] In addition to conducting meticulous research, Minister of Finance Xu Kan extensively sought the opinions of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and various experts regarding improving measures for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. It was decided to submit the proposal for approval at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th, after which it will be announced and implemented. Once these measures are announced, they will be uniformly implemented nationwide. The exchange procedures established by central banks in various regions are merely temporary measures and will be canceled at that time. The general content of the new measures was largely reported in this newspaper on the 11th. When military, police, government, and educational employees exchange, they may handle the deposit and exchange procedures with the Central Bank after approval by the responsible authority. However, when receiving gold, they must still personally bring their identification card, verify the photograph, and then receive it to prevent abuses. Furthermore, external rumors that gold prices will be adjusted after the implementation of the new measures are absolutely inaccurate. The authorities have not yet considered adjusting gold prices.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Governor of the Central Bank of China, Yu Hongjun, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th. In the afternoon, he attended a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee and discussed issues such as improving measures for depositing and exchanging gold and silver with Xu Kan.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Xu Kan and Yu Hongjun Invited to Attend Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Report on the Situation of Depositing and Exchanging Gold and Silver</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee held a closed-door meeting on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss measures for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. Minister of Finance Xu Kan and Governor of the Central Bank of China, Yu Hongjun, were both invited to attend. After the meeting began at around 3:00 PM, Chairman Wu Yuechao immediately invited Finance Minister Xu to report on the current situation and prospects for the implementation of the policy for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. He emphasized that the national treasury's reserves are substantial. Regarding gold alone, after the currency reform, the national treasury collected over 1.8 million taels, bringing the total, including previous holdings, to over 5.5 million taels. Currently, deposits and exchanges nationwide amount to less than 200,000 taels, so there is absolutely no concern about a shortage. However, the government is not completely disregarding efforts to guide sources. Currently, two matters are being considered: (1) obtaining a portion of gold from U.S. aid, and (2) purchasing a considerable amount of gold and silver from foreign countries. The Finance Minister also explained that the government has noted the various aspects of exchange techniques awaiting improvement nationwide, as well as the unsatisfactory order and rampant black market caused by scalpers. Meetings have been held several times in the past week to discuss improvements. However, all discussions have focused on technical issues, and all external rumors are purely unfounded. The government has great confidence in the deposit and exchange policy and is determined to implement it thoroughly to absorb idle funds and stabilize prices. Governor Yu then explained the actual situation of the Central Bank's handling of deposits and exchanges since its implementation, providing a detailed description of large-scale purchases by major players in the market and scalpers crowding overnight. He stated that the Central Bank, as the implementing agency of this policy, will continue to work hard to improve procedures and prevent abuses so that ordinary people can conveniently deposit and prevent wealth from being concentrated in the hands of a few major players and scalpers who profit from the middle, disrupting the financial system. After Yu's report, the committee members spoke in turn. Combining their common opinions, they amounted to the following points: (1) The government should pay attention to the gold and silver reserves to determine whether deposits and exchanges can be handled indefinitely, and constantly find ways to replenish the national treasury. (2) If the deposit and exchange policy can continue indefinitely, it should be implemented long-term to overcome the deeply rooted societal tendency to value gold and silver over currency, thereby restoring the government's long-lost credibility. (3) Regarding exchange techniques, major players exchanging over ten taels of gold must first fill out a purchase certificate, which must be approved before they can deposit or exchange. For those under ten taels, efforts should be made to ensure widespread participation, and if necessary, various commercial banks can be widely entrusted to act as agents. Regarding facilitating deposits and exchanges for government and educational employees, there should be no problem in principle, but the specific technical methods still need to be studied. Some committee members advocated exclusively handling deposits and exchanges for government and educational employees on holidays, but there are also concerns about crowding. Some committee members suggested that various agencies handle it on a unified basis, but the Ministry of Finance believes that government and educational personnel have few spare funds for deposits and exchanges, and they would inevitably be bothered by relatives and friends, turning them into special scalpers. As for issuing salary payments combined with exchanges for silver dollars at the time of salary distribution, there are also concerns about wage issues, which also need to be carefully considered. At the end of the meeting, Xu and Yu expressed their deep gratitude for the opinions of the committee members. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Supervisory Yuan Submits Corrective Proposal; Urges Adoption of Remedial Measures <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Supervisory Yuan has submitted a corrective proposal regarding the Central Bank's improper handling of deposit and exchange procedures and the soaring black market prices of gold and silver, which are affecting currency confidence. The proposal was submitted by Supervisory Yuan members Yu Zhenzhou, Wang Xiangchen, Zhao Xi, and others. It was passed by the second temporary meeting of the Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Food Committee held at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, requesting the Executive Yuan to take swift and effective measures to remedy the situation. The proposal included the following corrective opinions: (1) To enable people to have equal deposit and exchange opportunities, staggered processing should be implemented. Each household should be limited to one deposit and exchange per period. The second period should only be continued after all households registered in the first period have been processed. (2) When ordinary citizens apply for deposits and exchanges, they should submit their identification cards for verification (all newly issued or reissued identification cards must be valid for three months to prevent abuses). After review and registration, a permit with an assigned number should be issued, and the identification card should be stamped (with the period number, permit number, and amount deposited or exchanged). Then, processing should be carried out in the order of the numbers. The Central Bank should announce the numbers to be processed each day one day in advance. Overdue applications will not be accepted. If necessary, the deposit and exchange funds may be collected at once when the permit is issued. (3) The maximum amount of gold and silver that each household can apply for exchange should be strictly limited (gold should not exceed two taels in principle) so that the people can deposit and exchange widely. (4) A number of days (or an average of one to two days per week) should be designated each period to specifically handle deposits and exchanges for civil and military government and educational personnel. Each agency and school should prepare a list, along with identification cards and deposit and exchange funds to be submitted to the accepting bank for processing, and then the original agency or school should collect and distribute the funds. (5) The government should swiftly adopt effective methods to eliminate the gold and silver black market and strictly crack down on fixed and mobile gold and silver vendors. For black market gold and silver transactions, the gold and silver should be confiscated or purchased at the official price, depending on the severity of the circumstances. The justification for the proposal mentioned the current abuses in the deposit and exchange situation, as well as the fact that various accepting banks are handling negative deposits and exchanges outside of daily business hours, taking advantage of the opportunity to collude internally and fraudulently purchase various realities, which is considered extremely unreasonable and should be corrected immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Cause of Shanghai-Taiwan Flight Accident; Investigation Reveals Collision with Mountain While Seeking Route; Treatment of Injured Passengers Progressing Well <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Office, 13th] The cause of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Shanghai-Taiwan flight accident has now been determined. The pilot of the aircraft, Liang Zhaolai, was an excellent driver with seventeen years of flying experience. When flying to Wenzhou, he realized that the weather was terrible, so he flew at a high altitude of 8,000 meters. When he reached the airspace above Tamsui, it was already past one o'clock in the afternoon. Affected by the low air pressure and the airflow from the hot spring water sources, the aircraft suddenly dropped to 1,500 meters. At that time, the fog was thick, and the direction could not be distinguished. He had no choice but to descend to find a route. When he discovered the Caigongkeng Mountain, which was more than 1,000 meters above sea level, blocking the road, it was unavoidable. Fortunately, pilot Liang quickly made an oblique flight, avoiding a head-on collision, and landed abruptly. The wings collided with the mountain rocks and caught fire. The passengers in the front row were burned by the fire, and most of the other passengers were also stunned. Fortunately, Yang Qing, Director of the Taiwan Office of the Resources Committee, was in the rear and bravely opened the aircraft door. Some of the conscious passengers helped the unconscious ones to jump down, resulting in injuries to many limbs. The treatment of the injured is progressing very well, but the telegraph operator Zhou Jinrong has all four limbs broken and a severe head injury and has not yet escaped danger. CNAC has already flown a special plane to the scene for inspection and may return to Shanghai that day. All today's flights arrived safely, but due to the worsening weather in the afternoon, they are scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Supervisory Yuan member Wang Xiangchen and others have recently submitted a corrective proposal to the Executive Yuan regarding the arbitrary increase in the exchange rate for small remittances by the Postal Remittance Bureau and other national banks, which is increasing the burden on ordinary people. It was passed by the Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Food Committee on the 13th. The proposal expressed dissatisfaction with the Postal Remittance Bureau's most recent adjustment of the exchange rate, which was 20/100, an excessive increase. The proposal also stated that it seems that national banks are completely standing on a position that is contrary to the interests of ordinary people, which is something that the people of the country cannot understand. It should request the Executive Yuan to promptly correct this and order all national banks to effectively reduce the exchange rate for small remittances and ensure that it does not exceed the standard set by the Central Bank.</p>

<p>We reprint Hoffman's written statement issued yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>I have been very happy to visit China, even though my time here has been very short. I have been concerned about China and the Chinese people for many years, and I have many Chinese friends here. However, this is the first opportunity I have had in my life to come to China, so when Mr. Lapham suggested that I come to China for an on-site observation last October, I agreed without urging.</p>
<p>Originally, I hoped that my first visit to China would be leisurely, but I regret that this trip is urgent and almost entirely for official business. However, on the other hand, I am very pleased that this trip is related to the ECA's economic assistance program, which aims to support and supplement the efforts of the Chinese people to strengthen their national economic position. When I met with President Truman on the eve of my departure from Washington, the President specifically instructed me to convey the long-standing and continuous friendship of the United States for the Chinese people, because friendship, mutual respect, and common interests have been the cornerstone of Sino-American relations and remain the basis of American policy to this day.</p>
<p>The purpose of my visit to China is not to decide or explain American policy toward China, because I am not qualified or authorized to resolve the complex military and political issues involved in that policy. The ECA's task is only to implement the economic plans passed by the President and Congress. We are not responsible for obtaining or implementing military assistance.</p>
<p>Our current task is to make the most of the funds for this assistance program that have not yet been allocated and to make any suggestions to Congress regarding future programs sound and complete. The basic policy must be decided by Congress.</p>
<p>I am very satisfied and enlightened to have this opportunity to see the work status and problems of the ECA China program. No matter how accurate the telegram reports from thousands of miles away are, they cannot compare with even a very short on-site inspection.</p>
<p>So far, I feel that Mr. Lapham's report has omitted one point, namely, that he did not mention the outstanding achievements made by himself and the staff of the branch office. The success of the ECA's program in this difficult period cannot be attributed to the perfect cooperation and valuable opinions provided by Dr. Wong Wen-hao and other members of the US Aid Committee. After talking with President Sun Ke, I am confident that under his leadership, the ECA will receive the same friendship and assistance.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The Allied Headquarters today returned to our country another batch of materials plundered by Japan during the war, with a total value of US$733,000. Furthermore, the Allied Headquarters has now received a suggestion from the Repatriation Advisory Committee to return materials to China with a total value of US$52,000. Wu Bannong, head of the Repatriation and Compensation Group of our country's delegation in Japan, said that the main items returned today include 771 pieces of machinery, valued at approximately US$583,000, while others include tin ingots, zinc, lead, vehicles, and books. As for the main items recommended to be returned to our country today, there are 33 pieces of machinery with a total value of US$48,000, including power generators, lathes, and shearing machines. Others include 49 kilograms of tin ingots valued at US$111, 2,483 kilograms of antimony ingots valued at US$2,103, one sedan valued at US$1,100, and printing machines from the Hong Kong branch of the Commercial Press valued at US$3,750.

<h3 id="e33">Ministry of Finance Issues Order to All Regions: Suppress Illegal Silver Dollar Vendors; The "Clinking" Sounds in the Capital No Longer Heard <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Recently, the Ministry of Finance, noting that silver dollar vendors in various regions were engaging in buying and selling silver coins, arbitrarily raising prices, creating a black market, and affecting the financial system, has dispatched telegrams to military and police agencies in the capital and financial management bureaus in all regions, ordering them to earnestly suppress these activities and immediately eliminate silver dollar vendors.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] The Capital Police Department mobilized police officers on the 13th to suppress vendors privately buying and selling silver dollars and foreign currency. The "clinking" sounds in the Xinjiekou and Jiankang Road areas are no longer heard. A spokesperson for the Police Department stated: "After the government announced revisions to all regulations regarding the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency, private buying and selling of gold, silver, and foreign currency remains prohibited by the government. However, as time passed, this practice resurfaced, and recently it has been reported that unscrupulous individuals are absorbing these items at high prices, leading to an increasingly rampant black market. This greatly disrupts the financial system and commodity prices. Previously, this department strictly ordered all bureaus to intensify suppression efforts. Today alone, over one hundred cases of suppression have been carried out. We will continue to rigorously enforce these measures in the future. The erroneous mindset of a small number of citizens who value silver over legal tender is also a cause for the existence of the black market. Therefore, we hope that citizens of this city, based on their enthusiasm for supporting the government in suppressing rebellion and building the nation, will assist the Police Department in implementing these legal measures."</p>

<h3 id="e34">Third UN General Assembly Declares Adjournment; Approves US-China-Australia Proposal on Korean Issue; Establishes Seven-Nation Committee to Monitor Troop Withdrawal and Promote Korean Unification <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] The United Nations Paris General Assembly, lasting twelve weeks, finally adjourned tonight. Prior to adjournment, the US-China-Australia proposal on the Korean issue was approved by a vote of 48 to 6, with only the Soviet bloc voting against and Sweden abstaining. The Assembly was originally scheduled to adjourn last night, but Soviet representative Malik's delaying tactics hindered the vote on the Korean issue, leading to a one-day extension of the meeting. During the afternoon session on Sunday, Malik continued to vehemently criticize the US and South Korea, but the representatives had no intention of debating further. It was said that representatives of Western countries adopted a "silent strategy" to force adjournment. Malik finally demanded that the Assembly vote on the Soviet proposal to end the work of the Korean Committee, which was rejected by a vote of 46 to 6. The content of the US-China-Australia proposal approved by the Assembly includes: (1) Recognizing the work of the Korean Committee. (2) Recognizing the South Korean government elected under the supervision of the UN delegation as the legitimate government. (3) Recommending that US and Soviet occupying forces withdraw from Korea as soon as possible within a feasible scope. (4) Ordering the Korean Committee to continue its work for another year, attempting to promote the unification of North and South Korea. (5) Ordering the Korean Committee to be responsible for supervision upon the withdrawal of occupying forces.

Therefore, Canada requested to withdraw, making it a seven-nation committee.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Costa Rica Notifies Security Council; Accuses Nicaragua of Violating Territory; Pan American Organization Prepares to Mediate <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] Costa Rica formally notified the President of the Security Council, stating that armed forces from Nicaragua invaded Costa Rican territory at 11:00 PM on December 10. However, Costa Rica did not request the Security Council to take action. It is widely believed that the Security Council will not intervene in the dispute unless formally requested to do so. However, the Nicaraguan government denied the Costa Rican government's accusations, stating that those who entered Costa Rican territory came from the sea, not from bases located in Nicaraguan territory.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The Council of the Organization of American States (OAS) decided to meet on the 14th to determine whether to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of all American countries to discuss the issue of Costa Rica accusing Nicaragua of supporting rebels to invade its territory. At the same time, the Council sent a telegram to the governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, stating that it hoped that they would fully cooperate in maintaining order in the Americas, and at the same time work together to effectively realize the necessary means to maintain peace.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] Observers here believe that the discord between Costa Rica and its neighbors is closely related to the future of inter-American relations and may be a test of the Rio Treaty to see if it has real value in seeking peaceful solutions to inter-American disputes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 12th] Costa Rica, a small country in Central America, is now facing armed attacks from its northern neighbor Nicaragua. The Costa Rican government has ordered general mobilization to cope with the threat. It is learned here that the invading forces are composed of Nicaraguans and Costa Rican anti-government figures led by former Costa Rican President Calderón Guardia. Costa Rican interim President Figueres recently declared that this military development is not a revolution against his government, but a war between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Figueres requested the use of the Inter-American Defense Treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947 to ensure the safety of Costa Rica. It is noted that Figueres ordered the dissolution of Costa Rica's national defense force of only 500 people on December 1, declaring Costa Rica a peaceful country. The armed forces remaining in Costa Rica are only about 1,000 police officers. Because after Calderón Guardia left office in February this year and was succeeded by President Picado, Picado's government was overthrown by Figueres, and Figueres replaced him as interim president. Calderón Guardia and Picado fled to Nicaragua to plot an uprising and subvert Figueres' regime. When they planned to send troops in Nicaragua, they received support from Nicaraguan dictator Somoza.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The national measures to improve gold and silver exchange, carried by Yu Hongjun to Beijing the night before last (the 12th) with currency, may be decided upon within days. According to unofficial sources, the key point of the new measures is to universalize the exchange, allowing organizations and groups to apply as a group, with each individual applying once with their ID card, potentially with a limit of two taels. Before the announcement of the new measures, to prevent scalpers from rushing to buy, the four banks have adopted temporary transitional measures starting yesterday. Citizens exchanging gold and silver must present their own ID card, and the photo will be verified. Each person can exchange only once, and the ID card will be stamped after the exchange for identification. Although the exchange measures have been vigorously improved by the Central Bank authorities, the crowding situation continues to increase. Even the use of "Flying Fortress" red police cars to suppress the crowds has no effect.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Songting, a police officer from the Jing'an Temple Police Station in this city, was on duty at the Fumin Road-Julu Road station at 10:00 AM on April 2nd of this year when Cheng Jiwu, a teacher from a certain school, reported that Shen Mufan, residing at No. 6, Lane 786, Julu Road, was smoking opium at home. Patrol officer Zhao Yingchao arrived, and they proceeded to Shen's residence together. Accompanied by Shen's driver, Ding Fulin, they went upstairs, while Cheng remained downstairs. Zhang entered Shen's bedroom and found no evidence of drug use, but suspected Shen's appearance. He intended to take Shen to the police station and prevented Shen from making phone calls. Ding mediated on Shen's behalf, and Zhao also persuaded Zhang. After discussion between Ding and Shen, Shen's wife took out seven pieces of jewelry, including two gold bracelets, two gold lockets, two gold rings, and a gold Ruyi ornament, and gave them to Ding to hand over to Zhang. To demonstrate that there was nothing illegal, Zhang coerced Shen into signing a certificate, and on the certificate, he crossed out the words "according to confidential information" and changed "smoking" to "similar to gambling." After that, they left. Later, Shen suspected Ding of collusion and suspended his employment. Subsequently, Ding became a driver for Zhu Shaoqi, the current General Manager of Dasheng Qianzhuang, where Shen was also a shareholder. On May 13th, Ding and Cheng encountered each other at Dasheng Qianzhuang and had an argument. The resident guard of Dasheng, Cheng Jingcheng, took them to the police station. On May 15th, Ding reported that Zhang and Zhao had jointly defrauded Shen of his property. After investigation and prosecution by the district prosecutor's office, Judge Wang of the District Court sentenced Zhang Songting to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for three years for taking advantage of his position to defraud property. Zhao Yingchao was sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years for aiding in the fraud. Cheng Jiwu's part was not considered.</p>

<p>As various circles express deep suspicion about the exchange of 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth for rice, hoping that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee and the Municipal Authorities will thoroughly investigate the matter, the Rice Merchants Association sent representatives at 10:00 AM on the 13th, holding 10,000 bolts of "Four Gentlemen" drill bills of lading from the China Textile Construction Company's 60,000 bolts of cotton cloth, to the company's First Printing and Dyeing Factory for delivery. The factory authorities refused to deliver the goods on the grounds that the procedures were not in compliance, stating that the Rice Merchants Association had paid the National Bank at the limited price for the cotton cloth, and the National Bank had promised to pay the Textile Construction Company for the cotton yarn at the limited price, but the National Bank had not yet allocated the cotton yarn to the company. Therefore, the company had to temporarily suspend the delivery of the current cotton cloth. Furthermore, according to the Textile Construction side, whether the cotton cloth was indeed exchanged for rice and shipped to Shanghai, and whether the rice was sold to the citizens at the limited price, must await confirmation by the relevant authorities before they can contact the National Bank.</p>

As for the export policy, it will still follow the previous regulations of the US Cotton United Transport Office, with 50% of the finished products being promoted for export and the other part being supplied to domestic needs. Regarding the raw material problem, it will be divided into domestic and foreign parts. Domestically, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office will try its best to purchase from the producing areas. Regarding the US aid cotton, in addition to the first batch of more than 96,000 bales and the second batch of 200,000 bales, which have been allocated, the third batch of 100,000 bales is currently being purchased. To further increase the supply of raw cotton, after discussing with relevant parties, he personally visited Hoffman the day before yesterday, providing Hoffman with the required figures and hoping that he would consider assisting. Finally, Mr. Gu stated that he does not advocate changes in the company's personnel in the future, in order to utilize experienced personnel.</p>

<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Tongji University has been suffering from a food shortage, and students have been reduced to two meals a day since last week. The school previously borrowed 120 dan of rice from the People's Livelihood Coordination Committee and purchased a portion itself. It can only last for one or two days now, and they are urging the People's Livelihood Coordination Committee to issue the rice allocated for December as soon as possible. In addition to launching a food storage campaign, in order to cope with the current food shortage and the future living problems, the College of Liberal Arts sponsored a "Life-Saving Auction" yesterday. Students from various colleges sent clothes, stationery, supplies, etc. to be auctioned to maintain their livelihood by selling the proceeds. So far, a total of more than 200 students have applied to return to their hometowns or transfer schools, and most of the others are taking a wait-and-see attitude, deciding whether to return to their hometowns depending on the changes in the situation. The school authorities have so far stated that they will still hold the final exam on schedule in mid-January, and the Ministry of Education has not yet given instructions on the issue of relocation.</p>
<p>Xia Jianbai, the president of the school, told reporters: In addition to the two dou of rice allocated by the People's Livelihood Coordination Committee for public-funded students, the Ministry of Education also provides three sheng, which are converted into cash at market prices. However, the non-staple food fee is currently 40 yuan. In fact, the 40 yuan non-staple food fee is not enough to cover the expenses of vegetables, cooking oil, and fuel, so most of the price of these three sheng of rice has been used to supplement it.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Rediscount Committee Approves Measures to Purchase Finished Products; National Banks Begin Processing Industrial Loans; Industrial Sector Believes Loan Interest Rates are Too High <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee formally began processing emergency industrial loans yesterday. All application forms have been sent to national banks and commercial firms. Last Saturday, factories directly applied to the Rediscount Committee, which has issued over a thousand application forms to date. After receiving applications from various manufacturers, the Rediscount Committee will submit them to the Trade, Industry, and Agriculture Advisory Committees for review and comments before presenting them to the Rediscount Committee for final approval. The Rediscount Committee held a meeting yesterday, approving several applications. The detailed measures for purchasing finished products were also established by the committee as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The handling of finished product purchase cases should be limited to those where the finished products have poor short-term sales and the business needs to be maintained. (2) The objects of purchase should be limited to the following items: (A) Daily necessities: cotton textiles, leather, paper, soap, matches, medicines; (B) Basic industrial and mining enterprises: steel, cement, machinery, coal; (C) Other industrial and mining specialties that meet the purchase criteria. (3) The quantity of purchase should not exceed the average monthly output of each manufacturer in the past six months. (4) After the finished product purchase case is approved, the Business Bureau of this bank will be notified to advance funds and entrust various banks and treasuries to organize separately or jointly within their professional scope. (5) The applicant manufacturer should fill in and submit the relevant information in accordance with the regulations for review. (6) The procedures for purchasing finished product prices and acceptance of delivery shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions: (A) The purchase price shall be based on the average market price of the six days prior to the signing of the contract; (B) After the entrusted bank signs the purchase contract, it shall immediately accept the finished products and pay the price. After the acceptance is completed, it shall handle the transfer procedures with the Central Bank and pay the relevant warehouse receipts to the Central Bank for verification. (7) The disposal of purchased finished products shall be based on the principle of auction, which shall be handled by the relevant authorities entrusted by the Central Bank at any time, and a handling fee shall be paid. (8) After the purchased finished products are disposed of in accordance with the provisions of Article 7, the proceeds shall be remitted to the Central Bank at any time to recover the advances.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the handling of this industrial loan, the authorities emphasized strict review to prevent funds from flowing into the speculative market and stimulating prices; however, the industrial sector is also dissatisfied with the current measures, primarily believing that the loan interest rate is too high, making it difficult for factories to bear. Secondly, the valuation of finished products for purchase, based on the average price of the previous six days, is considered too low because the prices of most industrial finished products are currently below cost.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Prices of Various Commodities Rise; Rice Market Remains Firm; Flour, Bran, and Edible Oil All Surge <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market, influenced by the rise in the prices of various commodities, also surged. Sellers were very firm, calling for higher prices from the morning, holding up prices quite strongly. Prices rose by 30 to 40 yuan in the morning, briefly weakening due to slightly sluggish sales, but turning firm again by the close. In the South Market, Bai Geng and Bo Dao were both priced at 375 yuan, each rising by 35 yuan. Early rice rose by 45 yuan, priced at 365 yuan. Xian rice rose by 20 to 30 yuan. In the North Market, Bai Geng was priced at 375 yuan, a rise of 25 yuan, and Bo Dao rose by 35 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 13,576 piculs arrived in the North and South Markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Rose sharply, influenced by the rise in rice prices. Sentiment was quite firm, and retail investors successively bought in, making the market exceptionally brisk. Old car flour opened at 160 yuan and then rose further to 162 yuan, a sharp increase of 16 yuan compared to the previous day. Soldier Ship flour fluctuated significantly, opening at 147 yuan, rising to 160 yuan at one point, and then falling back to 152 yuan at the close, a rise of 16 yuan. Xiong brand flour consistently rose by 15 to 16 yuan. Bran rose sharply by 15%.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Rose across the board. Due to the rise in rice prices, sentiment also turned firm, and guest traders purchased actively, leading to consistent price increases. Yellow beans rose by 15 yuan, picked green beans rose by 10 yuan, and corn and red sorghum were purchased by guest traders, leading to the strongest price increases, with corn rising by 20% and red sorghum rising sharply by 25%. Sesame rose by 20 to 30 yuan, and raw kernels continued to be purchased by Cantonese traders, rising by another 40 to 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Yesterday's rise turned fierce. Due to the rise in rice prices, prices were raised by 70 to 80 yuan at the opening, and later, due to the significant rise in the prices of various commodities, retail investors bought in, and soybean oil finally broke through the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching as high as 1,040 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil was 930 yuan, each rising by 150 yuan, reaching 15%. Raw oil was 1,040 yuan. Soybean cake was 80 yuan, a rise of 7 to 8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Sugar Market Turns Brisk <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market was flat first and then higher yesterday. Traders had ample funds, and the prices of various commodities rose across the board, making sentiment brisk and increasing demand.</p>
<p>Car No. 4545 white refined sugar opened at 400 yuan. After opening, there were more buyers than sellers, and the buying interest of various traders became stronger, pushing the market price straight up to a high of 445 yuan. After the high, the market softened, and retail investors switched from buying to selling, causing the price to fall back again, closing at 430 yuan, a rise of 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse sand and medium sand gradually rose, each rising by 20 yuan. The factory's snow-white and cotton-white sugars each rose by 30 yuan, and the rest were generally brisk.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Export Tea Buying Interest Strong <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw a consistent rise in export boxed tea. The reasons were that the foreign exchange transfer certificate remained stable, and the authorities allowed the restoration of loans to assist exports, so sentiment became more positive, and exporters' buying interest returned. However, holders, given the high cost, insisted on selling firmly, so transactions were in negotiation and stalemate, and no significant progress was seen, but the underlying trend was unwilling to lie dormant and was rapidly soaring. As for domestic tea, the process was active and unabated due to the concentration of buying interest from this street and other places.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Tung Oil Advances Rapidly <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Although the actual sales of tung oil were still sluggish yesterday, the trend reversed and advanced wildly. The reason was that after the increase in public utility costs, the cost invisibly increased, and at the same time, various commodities began to stir. In addition, there were many other favorable buying factors, which stimulated the market and raised prices. In terms of prices, in addition to the fully measured white oil being priced as high as 750 yuan per dan, the genuine Western Hong oil also reached 650 yuan per barrel, and the rest all jumped wildly.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Lumber Market Turns Firm <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The lumber market, since the loosening of monetary policy on Saturday, has seen sentiment firm. Yesterday, there were many buyers among the industry, and lumber that had been sluggish for a long time was able to stand out. Fir strips rose by 20 cents. Pine slices opened at 1.80 yuan, rising by 35 cents. Plywood also followed suit, rising by 2 to 4 yuan. Tanhu board increased by 5 yuan, and although foreign pine remained at 3 yuan, the market was also firm.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Since the Implementation of the Chain System, the Export Industry Has Remained Difficult to Improve <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>It has recently been learned from the import and export industry that since the implementation of the import and export chain system, the export business once showed a thriving trend. However, to date, this phenomenon has returned to a state of decline. The reasons for this are, first, that due to domestic conditions, transportation is difficult, and the cost of export goods has increased sharply. Second, although the price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate has gradually improved, the sales have not yet reached the ideal stage, and there is still a very large gap between its price and the actual price.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Indian Traders Plan to Acquire Silk; China Silk Company Announces Sales Price <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Silk exports have been lively for days. Recently, Indian traders have frequently inquired about prices from various dealers. China Silk Company has recently replied by telegraph, announcing prices of 1,800 rupees per load for 210 double-strand silk, 1,500 rupees per load for 140 double-strand silk, and 1,400 rupees per load for 80 double-strand silk.

<h3 id="e90">Silk Soars <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, external funds continued to flow into rayon, and buying interest suddenly surged. There was a shortage of chips in the market, and prices were constantly being pushed up, making sentiment firm and brisk.</p>
<p>120 Tianqiao opened at 13,000 yuan in the morning. After opening, retail investors vigorously absorbed the supply, and the buying interest of local traders became more brisk, with prices soaring all the way to a high of 16,000 yuan. Later, news came that the yarn market had shrunk, and because sales were scarce, sentiment became volatile. With many people eager to take profits, the supply in the market increased, and the market price fell back by 500 yuan. By the close, the market had stabilized, rising by 3,000 yuan, with Dongyang Gold and Sanma following suit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the export price of raw silk did not improve, and no transactions took place. Domestic goods were slightly higher due to a slight increase in finished products, and factory buying interest expanded. Rayon and cloth rose together, and sentiment was bullish. Grade D was traded at 16,500 yuan, and superior odd lots were traded at 16,000 yuan, each rising by 3,000 yuan, and the rest all followed suit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market demand for silk fabrics improved, and guest traders were active. Prices opened high in the morning, and the opening prices for bed covers were 8,900 yuan and 9,000 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the rise in cotton yarn prices continued. The supply of money in the market was still loose and abundant, and sentiment was consistently bullish. Holders raised prices and sold sparingly, and buyers tried their best to gather supplies, causing market prices to rise again.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at a high price of 16,500 yuan. At one point, local traders took the opportunity to sell at high prices, falling to a low of 15,500 yuan, but closing at 15,800 yuan, a rise of 800 yuan compared to the weekend. Other brands, such as Baoguang and Jincheng, also rose by varying amounts from 700 yuan to 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>32-count Silver Moon rose by 1,800 yuan, and 21-count Shuangma spot goods, after opening at 14,500 yuan, fell slightly to 14,000 yuan, finally closing at 14,200 yuan, a rise of 1,400 yuan.</p>
<p>20-count Shuangma was uniquely unable to open strongly, so it remained unchanged at the original level of 11,700 yuan. Other brands, such as Jinji and Tiannv, also rose by around 1,000 yuan, and the remaining yarns, such as 16-count and 10-count yarns, also showed strength.</p>
<p>The cloth market reached its peak, and new high prices appeared again for various cloths in the soaring market. Holders expressed optimism about the future and were reluctant to sell, and local buyers scrambled to gather supplies, causing the market to flourish and prices to fluctuate sharply.</p>
<p>At the opening, Longtou fine cloth was 480 yuan, and Four Gentlemen yuan beji was 490 yuan. Later, due to strong demand from all parties, holders strongly resisted lowering prices under the coverage of buying interest, and various cloths advanced sharply towards their peaks. Near the close, prices fell slightly due to profit-taking sales, and Longtou fine cloth closed at 525 yuan, a sharp jump of 85 yuan compared to the previous week. Four Gentlemen beji was 535 yuan, up 75 yuan. Other mid-range yuan beji also rose by around 70 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e93">"Lamp Runs Out of Oil" Sends a Sigh; Mr. Chen Bulei in Hangzhou <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng for this Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou, December 12] In the early autumn of 1948, Mr. Bulei came to Haining to watch the tide and visited Hangzhou along the way. At that time, I went to Haining to meet Mr. Chen. On the way from Haining to Hangzhou, he and I were in the same car, and he told me a lot about the history of Hangzhou. Mr. Bulei came to Hangzhou to study when he was in his teens. He said that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway had not yet been built at that time, and he had to follow the Gongchen Bridge Canal to Shanghai, without the wide roads and new buildings that exist today.</p>
<p>Memories of Hangzhou</p>
<p>Mr. Bulei smiled and said: "When I was studying, Jufengyuan Restaurant was the most famous. We students didn't go to Jufengyuan very often. Going to Jufengyuan was a grand feast. If the students pooled their money to feast a teacher, it would be at Jufengyuan. Now there are several famous restaurants."</p>
<p>Mr. Bulei also told me that he used to live in Xiaoyunzhuang when he was the director of the Zhejiang Education Department, and he missed Hangzhou very much when he left Zhejiang. One winter, he came to Hangzhou alone, to the New New Hotel, wanting a room facing the lake with plenty of light, and wrote behind closed doors. The hotel owner didn't know what Mr. Bulei was doing, and was very curious. Little did he know that this article, which shocked the whole country that year, was produced on West Lake.</p>
<p>Recalling Visits to the Mountains</p>
<p>Mr. Bulei was able to recount all the scenic spots on the lake in detail. He asked me in the car whether the Yuexia Laoren Temple (Old Man Under the Moon Temple) was still intact. One afternoon in Nanshan, I accompanied him to Baiyun Nunnery. Mr. Chen asked for a fortune slip, and everyone who went with him got a slip. When we came out, we saw a fashionable couple walking in hand in hand. I said, "This is a couple in love." Mr. Bulei smiled and said to me, "They are here to fulfill a vow." After leaving the nunnery, I returned to the nunnery and saw that red candles were burning high, and the couple was bowing together.</p>
<p>On the trip to Beishan, Mr. Wang Fuqing, who was traveling with us, suggested climbing and crossing the peaks to Shang Tianzhu. Many of us were worried that Mr. and Mrs. Chen would be too tired, and we wanted to hire porters for them, but Mr. Chen refused, so we climbed to Shang Tianzhu. At that time, the weather was still hot, with a temperature of about 90 degrees, but Mr. Chen didn't feel tired at all. Later, we drove to Yunqi, and Mr. Chen expressed his sympathy when he saw the students from Qilu University trudging to Hangzhou. When he came out of the main hall, he saw a student buried in his studies, looking at him for a long time, and said to me with emotion: "It's not easy to study in peace now."</p>
<p>A Turn for the Better</p>
<p>During the four days that Mr. Chen was in Hangzhou, he was always concerned about official business, and he often muttered to himself: "The work is tense, and I'm still taking a break here to visit the mountains and rivers." We all advised him to let go for a while.</p>
<p>I once talked to Mr. Chen about the construction of Hangzhou as an ideal cultural city, and Mr. Chen expressed his strong agreement. He said, "Hangzhou has a quiet environment where you can write." He also said to me, "News reporters need to have good interpersonal relationships, be quick-witted, and write fast. Hands, feet, and eyes all need to be fast."</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen returned to Shanghai, on his way to Nanjing, he sent me a letter, saying: "...This trip to Haining and Hangzhou, lingering for four days, and coming into contact with the magnificent scenery of nature, made my illness turn for the better, and I am very happy..."</p>
<p>The True Colors of a Scholar</p>
<p>As Mr. Bulei said, these four days in Hangzhou were truly spent "together from morning to night." In our time "together from morning to night," I felt that Mr. Chen was respectful to his career, loving to his friends, and especially self-sacrificing to himself. When he visited Hangzhou, he stayed in a villa on the Inner West Lake. This villa was not very famous, the palm-canopy bed and equipment were very simple, but Mr. Chen was able to sleep soundly for several nights. He didn't order any famous dishes when he ate. He could swallow anything that was brought to him. During his stay in Hangzhou, he always wore an old felt hat and a faded chestnut-colored silk coat. He was always very strict and self-possessed throughout his life, maintaining the true colors of a scholar. In the current environment, where can you find a scholar-like reader?</p>
<p>Sleeping in the Lakes and Mountains Forever</p>
<p>Mr. Chen saw Hangzhou prosper, so he especially loved Hangzhou and cared about Hangzhou. The happiness he gained in Hangzhou after visiting Hangzhou actually made his illness turn for the better. If he could be given enough time to rest in Hangzhou for a period of time, he might not have encountered this tragic change.</p>
<p>There are many knowledgeable people in China. He himself sacrificed himself in order to maintain the true colors of a scholar, and society neglected to pay attention. Although Mr. Chen's suicide note contained the words "the lamp has run out of oil," why did "the lamp run out of oil"? Why didn't he add some "oil" and trim the "wick" to make it return to brightness, knowing that the oil was about to run out and the lamp was about to go out?</p>
<p>In his will, Mr. Chen instructed that he be buried simply and lightly in the suburbs of Nanjing, but Mr. Chen's family knew that Mr. Chen loved Hangzhou very much when he was alive. He had bought mountain land with friends in Xucun in those years, and Mr. Chen intended to build a house to retire, but he never fulfilled his wish for a long time because he was unable to build a house. Now, bury him in Hangzhou, so that he can sleep forever in this landscape and rest in peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is gone! I feel empty and unreal. The gentleman who fully represents the Chinese scholar tradition is gone! It seems that a big problem is left for us to seek a solution.</p>

Especially after the retreat from the Northeast, and with Lin Biao's troops entering the pass, Tangshan is at the forefront of North China. Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) and Tangshan form a mutually reinforcing defensive position, making it the only major military town in North China and the first point of contention in the Eastern Hebei campaign.</p>
<p>Your correspondent arrived in Tangshan from Beiping (Beijing) on the 5th, traveling east along the Beining Railway. The large and small stations between Beiping and Tangshan were filled with troop trains and military supplies. The constant movement of military vehicles east and west gave people a palpable sense of tension.</p>
<p>The express train, which normally takes only six hours to reach Tangshan from Beiping, took twelve hours due to the large number of military vehicles along the line, causing frequent stops at each station.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the train and into the city, the first thing that catches the eye is the "street and alley fortresses." At major intersections and busy areas, cement and stone slab bunkers, five feet above the ground, have been built.</p>
<p>The retreat from Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan, and the destruction of the Luan River railway bridge, have created a superficial prosperity in Tangshan. Military, government, and educational personnel, as well as refugees, from various parts of eastern Tangshan are gathering in Tangshan. Land is scarce and people are crowded, and the city's thirty-plus hotels and inns are full.</p>
<p>In Tangshan, more than sixty businesses opened last month. The chamber of commerce and women's associations are engaging in farcical re-elections and campaigns. In addition, the continuous production of the Kailuan mines provides the local residents with a good sedative. The current city population has exceeded 200,000, leading to the influx of floating capital from various counties in eastern Hebei and the disruption of material supplies, causing high prices.</p>
<p>However, this area has a unique advantage bestowed by God: low coal prices, resulting in ample power supply. Looking deeper into Tangshan society, Jiaotong University has already moved south, Qixin Cement Company is about to be forced to shut down, Kailuan coal cannot be transported out, and inventory is increasing. The tragic plight of the poor and refugees, the westward migration of wealthy merchants, and the fear of an impending storm, constantly worrying about the safety of the Tianjin-Tangshan road, all combine to form the bright and dark sides of Tangshan society.</p>
<p>To defend Tangshan and leverage the power of total war, in addition to the thorough deployments made by the North China military authorities in response to the current situation in eastern Hebei, the local military has stipulated several emergency measures for wartime: (1) Residents who do not need to live in the urban area may voluntarily evacuate; (2) Citizens should store water and purchase at least half a month's worth of food; (3) Everyone must cooperate with the military and strictly abide by martial law; (4) Regulations on curfews, alarms for bandits, and combat alert signals.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's Cixi 13th dispatch] Chen Bulei of Cixi served the country with his articles and his merits were outstanding. He ultimately dedicated himself wholeheartedly until his death. The news spread and the entire country mourned. People from all walks of life in Cixi knew Chen well and were extremely shocked and grieved upon hearing the news. They jointly initiated a memorial service for Chen to be held on the 17th of this month and plan to build a memorial hall to commemorate him permanently. The memorial is sincere and heartfelt and beautifully written. It states, "The public character was upright and unyielding, rejecting flattery, as awe-inspiring as the summer sun, yet his demeanor was graceful, encompassing everything, as lovable as the winter sun. In handling state affairs, he had a passionate heart, avoiding no difficulty, and doing everything with a revolutionary spirit, yet he had a pure and serene spirit, cultivating himself quietly. With his lifelong learning and personality, he inspired friends and parties, united the country, and promoted constitutionalism. It has never been heard of him taking credit for his achievements. As for his unwavering devotion to the head of state, his integrity, and his leadership of the masses, he is truly a model of public service and patriotism in this turbulent world, and a guide to transforming the declining social customs."</p>
