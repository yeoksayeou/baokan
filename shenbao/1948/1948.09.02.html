<h3>美援工業配件贈款　四單位首獲資助　開濼礦·揚子電力·冀北電力·台糖公司　共撥款四百四十萬美元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美援運用委員會么員嚴家淦，美國經合總署中國分署署長賴樸翰，及分署建設調查團團長司徒立門，昨日下午十時，在此問華　飯店，聯合執行新聞界。即席宣布，在三千五百萬美元工業配件之贈予款項中，首獲資助者，計有開濼煤礦，揚子電力公司，冀北電力公司，及台糖公司等四單位。　撥之款項共達四百四十萬美元。</p>
<p>四單位重要性</p>
<p>嚴家淦氏首述該四單位事業之重要性：</p>
<p>（一）楊子電力公司，包括戚墅堰發電廠，供應南京戚墅堰方面電力。因配件之不足，發電不足應付該一區域工業之需要，現法定劃撥一百二十萬美元，以增加該一區域之生產及促進就業之機會。該項工程，由美商愼昌洋行承辦。</p>
<p>（二）開灤煤礦公司，該礦供應之煤量，已佔全國產煤量百分之五十，今日除為華北主要之煤源外，且亦為華中（包括上海）燃煤之供應地。上海之電力為其工業之淵源。故上海之燃料供應有賴開灤煤斤。而該礦現狀極壞，如不積極整修，開採工作勢將全盤隨之瓦解。茲特劃撥一百萬美元，以資整頓，工程則由怡和工程公司承辦。</p>
<p>（三）冀北電力公司，此原係資委會重要工程之一，關係華北工業生產殊鉅。該公司過去以缺乏重要器材，無法充份供應電力，此次特劃撥一百二十萬美元，俾資補充，工程由威利韓公司承辦。</p>
<p>（四）台灣糖業公司，該公司之重要性，在能以多餘之食糖外銷，為國家爭取寳貴之外匯資源，故　劃撥一百萬美元，以便增產外　。全部工程，由用美國運輸公司承辦。</p>
<p>嚴氏稱：以上四畢位及劃撥之四百四十萬美元，不過係三千五百萬美元工業配件款項運用之開端。渠代表政府及人民，對賴樸翰，司徒立門及經合分署之工作及努力，表示感幸。並稱：在中美政府雙方努力合作之下，美援運用可獲得最大之成功。</p>
<p>司徒立門談話</p>
<p>司徒立門率領建設調査團於過去三閱月中，廣泛研究中國工業之重大需要。據渠宣稱：上述四種企業在中國經濟上所據之地位，甚為重要，故經選為首批撥款之對象，司徒氏並稱：「吾人自衆多申請援助者中，竭力選擇適當之對象，其目的在使吾人之資金，在合理時期內，得到最善之利用。再者吾人在工程之實踐，採辦，裝置與金融之調度等方面，均採鄭重之步驟，使凡屬吾人執行或贊助者均能達到完善之結果，以期增進生產裨益中國人民。吾人以此四種企業為肇端，亦屬吾人擬採計劃與步驟上之一種試驗，並在實行上確定其確為有成效。」　旋司徒立門對工業配件之購運有所解釋。渠表示：凡在中國國內原有之配件，或國內能自行製造者，將儘先利用，以便　節外匯。即使必須向國外購備，則可向生產工業配件效率優越之任何國家採辦。先決條件偽價條與交貨時間之長短。姑不論所需材料，係產於中國，英國，法國，比利時，日本，瑞典，瑞士或其他任何國家　司徒氏昨特分發參與建設及工業配件計劃下各商業團體或政府機構應訂之誓約書條文，說明美國對復興世界促進國際貿易之旨趣，。司徒氏並稱：此一誓約書，對於一般人所謂美援之日的乃　美國剩餘物資開闢市場之說，實為一種直接答覆。</p>
<p>司徒氏昨在其書面談話中說明：中美兩國政府，在原則上決定撥款七千萬美元，專作工業配件及建設計劃之用。原定計劃，擬將一千萬美元，以贈予方式、撥充採辦配件之用。另以六千萬美元，以借貸方式，作建設之用。惟經實地調査後，深信今日中國所最需要者，係配件之供給。中國政府對　亦表同意，結果於七千萬美元中，撥出三千五百萬美元，以贈予方式作為配件之用。</p>
<p>渠表示：「吾人已擬定計劃，使獲得援助之各種工業，在獲致原料及配備之採辦，運輸裝置與使用上，俱能順利進行，而運華者決非徒供堆置倉庫之物料，而一均係切合實用之配件。而在執行本計劃時，吾人始能獲得中國同事竭誠之合作。」</p>
<p>賴樸翰表滿意</p>
<p>招待會主席賴樸翰在開會時，對於配件補充及建設計劃已在中國開始實施一點，深表滿意。並稱此舉將大為改善中國之經濟狀况。</p>
<p>賴氏又謂：「此乃眞正之開始，亦係多數熱誠人士潛深研究之產物。渠等在吾人有限之經濟能力下，盡力設法改進此一偉大國家之現狀。調查團在工作時，始終獲得中國政府之協助與合作，此種合作，使余深信自此一微小之肇端，吾人必有遠大之前程。」</p>

<h3>德國問題解決的關鍵</h3>
<p>四　制憲會議昨已在貝多汶的故鄕波恩城開幕，將依照倫敦六織西德協定的規定，開始起草機國民主憲法。不管莫斯科談判的結果如何，也不論柏林危機將來如何演變，但行見「德意志第二次共和」的誕生，總是目前國際政治上値得重視的一件大事。</p>
<p>最近歐洲局勢的明　不定，仿佛到了雹雨季節，乍晴乍雨，幾乎不可捉摸。一方面，莫斯科談判已獲進展，本可發表公報吿一段落，却因法國政潮突起而作罷，國際上的陰霾尙未能一掃而空；加以級約發生蘇聯間諜案，致使雙方互相封閉領事館，雖不致直接影響到莫斯科談判，但美蘇關係的每况愈下，更似信而有徵的了。另一方面，蘇聯對柏林的封鎖，因爲莫斯科談判獲有轉機，也不及以前雷屬風行，柏林危機似可消弭於無形，但德共連日在柏林舉行示威運動，循入柏林市府大廈，企圖以暴力推翻柏林的民選政府，使在憂患危機中升沉六十多天的柏林，又引起了一塲軒然大波。英美法蘇四强駐德司令前天雖也開會，討論統一幣制及解除封鎖事宜，但世人並不寄以多大的期望。這些明暗不定的現象，均足以說明戰後歐洲局轎的沉悶與微妙。</p>
<p>其實所謂德國問題，原是戰後盟國的共同問題，如何收拾戰後的歐洲殘局，如何管制戰敗的德國使其不能再起侵略，盟國的利書本來是完全一致的；無如在納粹德國投降之後，盟國一再舉行國際會議，討論德國問題，始終沒有商得一個共同一致的政策，以致對德和會迄未召開，搞到如今，反而使所謂德國問題根本變了質。因此，今日的德國問題，竟變爲美蘇問題，雙方都把德國當作爭取的對像，事之可怪，莫過於此。在西方盟國方面，從三國佔領區合併起，到現在西德改革幣制爲止，無往而不欲扶植德國復興經濟，好敎德國做他們在歐洲的反共前衛，使蘇聯的勢力不能越雷池一步。但在蘇聯方面，更在她的佔領區內，千方百計，爭取人心，造成德國人民的反美心理，企圖將美英法三國逐出柏林，好敎德共在柏林組織「人民政府」，參加新共產國際，從事反美反帝的工作。所以這次蘇聯封鎖柏林引起空前危機，嚴格言之，就是蘇聯與西方盟　的爭奪戰，實在已超過一般以所謂的「冷戰」。</p>
<p>從蘇聯封鎖柏林之日起，迄今已逾兩月，世人無不　息以待柏林局勢的化險為夷。但是直到現在，我們僅看到莫斯科的談判，從七月卅日起，英美法三國的使節，就在莫斯科　　洛托夫史太林進行談判，到現在才獲得一個初步結果，不能不謂已盡迂迴曲折的能事，而且這個結果，祇是史太林同意西方盟國共同管制柏林的通貨而已，離開柏林問題的解決，還有相當的距離。說不定，或許是蘇聯外交手法的變換，蘇聯槪不能以封鎖和恫聯的手段迫令西方盟國退出柏林，自然不得不變換手法而要假手於德共了。在德共葡入柏林市府的前夕，德國社會統一黨代表三千餘人舉行大會，該黨領袖畢克演說，不僅指摘柏林市府反抗蘇聯政令，而且公然要求西方盟國退出柏林。僅從這個角度去觀察，蘇聯的意向如何，也就可以洞燭無遺了。</p>
<p>要之，柏林的危機尙未過去，談判的前途朱容樂觀，目前最迫切的問題，首在柏林局勢獲得澄淸，千萬不容節外生枝，德共的行動若不立即停止，則西方盟國對於蘇聯的眞正意向，總不能深信無疑的。柏林蘇軍司令拒絕市府要求劃分中立區，尤爲不智之舉。我們認爲唯有在維持柏林現狀的條件之下，進行談判，始能獲致解決方案。所以德共在柏林的行動，實爲四强談判成敗所繫，也是德國問題解決的關鍵。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅一日電〕第三黨總統候選人華萊士，在南方各州舉行競選演說時，力言黑人應與白人享受同等之公民權，聽衆即紛紛以鷄蛋與蕃茄擲之。柏明翰之警察長曾向華萊士提出警吿：謂該地法律禁止黑人與白人同時聽講，華萊士置諸丕顧，演講時仍召集黑白聽衆雜處，因而引起更多之鷄蛋與白薯之擲擊。白宮秘書羅斯今日引杜魯門之評南方之反華萊士示威稱：「此實違背美國之習慣，破壞美國之傳統」，然筆萊士宣稱：渠將無織在南方各州發表競選演說。</p>

<h3>經警繼續檢查各紗廠　十餘廠存紗被封　蔣經國譴責廠商不應觀望不售　如再因循決採斷然措置</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕蔣督導員經國昨日上午十時，召見中國訪建公司負責人束雲章，吳味經，就紗布之供應及價格問題，交換意見。蔣氏當時指出：自實施限價以來，紗布交易稀少，影響供應，紡建雖源源配出紗布，但紗布號於配得後持觀望態度，出售之數量不多，有囤積嫌疑，希望紡建公司能對此作一詳細調查。同時，民營紗廠日來賣出之成品甚少，大部份均特觀望，實非應有之態度，甚盼此類廠家能顧及國家社會之利益，稍作犧牲。午後蔣氏復召見紗業鉅子王啓宇氏，指示民營紗廠應大量賣出成品，如成本不敷，可藉抑平原棉價格打通棉花來源等辦法，以減低紗布之生產成本。目前民營紗廠之觀望態度，實不應有，如因循不改，決於最短期內採取斷然措置，予以糾正。</p>

<h3>限價表公布·小菜塲平靜</h3>
<p>產地豬價已告上漲商人深恐來源枯竭</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕各項葷素小菜限價表，自經社會局核定，昨日由社會警察兩局會銜公布後，社警兩局昨派員赴各小菜塲巡視，結果情形尙稱良好，猪肉等日常菜蔬均遵照規定價格發售。惟猪肉來源尙有問題，因硬性規定依照八一九之價目，來源有枯竭之虞，據昨日猪肉商向社會局陳述困難情形，略謂猪肉批發價每斤金圓四角八分，此係根據八月十九日之價格，而八一九之價，乃根據蘇北產區八月十一二日之價而定，但八月十一二日至今，蘇北產區猪價業已上漲，綏靖捐又增加八成，故倘照目前之價，恐影饗來源。同時南京方面，因距產區較近，八月十九日出售之猪隻，乃於八月十四五日由產區運京，故南京八一九之猪肉價格，係依據產區八月十四五日之價而訂，售價較本市爲高，南京之八一九猪肉批發價每斤爲五角四分。社會局已將上述情形，轉呈經濟督導員辦公室審核。</p>

<h3>供應局新門市部人山人海　各路「黃牛」搶購擠碎玻璃十二塊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕物資供應局在永安公司新厦底層之門市部昨日開業，因一般日用品售價較市面爲低，致成爲黃牛黨獲取之目標。淸晨六起，各路「黃牛」即陸續聚集於七重天門口，此後人愈來愈多，至十時許門市部開幕之時，門外已聚近千人，其中雖亦有普通市民，但聲勢浩大之黃牛黨陣容顯然可見。當鐵門啓處，羣衆一哄而進，剎時間門市部中已滿坑滿谷，價格特別便宜之罐頭食品，化妝品，衣料等一掃而光。物資供應局雖規定每種物品每人限購兩件，但黃牛黨採取合作辦法，一人買得物品後交與另一人，此人旋則反覆再買第二次第三次。彼等對於罐頭花生米尤感興趣，因售價每罐三十萬，而市面則售五十萬，一轉手間每罐可獲利二十萬，故彼等離去時每人手中大都携有十餘罐之多。當羣衆擠購之際，人聲嘈雜，秩序紊亂，櫃台玻璃被擠碎十二塊，交易達於無法進行之地步。此時馬路上趨入之顧客仍多如過江之鄉，乃急電警察局臨時派警備車載警士五十餘人到塲維持秩序，並將鐵門拉下，只許出不許進。至十一時左右，門市部決定打烊暫停營業，於門首高掛牌示：「各項貨品急需整理，諸君購貨，明日請早。」洶湧之人潮始逐漸散去。　今日出售辦法經商討後將予改善，除加强警衛維特秩序外，顧客擬予分批放入，花生米等特別廉價之物品，購買時則須自另一邊門挨次序排隊，同時對於顧客携出之各種物品數量，將予檢查，以防止黃牛黨套購。惟造成搶講之根本原因在於售價較市面爲低，故物資供應局或將考慮予以提高云。</p>

<h3>虹口射擊塲慘劇　廢砲彈爆炸死傷達八人　中有暨南大學生四名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日中午十二時四十分左右北四川路底虹口公園附近射擊傷舊址，突然發生廢砲彈爆炸，死傷八人之慘劇。緣海軍總司令部上海工廠戰後曾接收日軍遺留之十五米厘迫擊砲廢砲彈三千五百卅一枚，堆置於該射擊塲舊址。最近該廠爲求廢物利用，經與朱市大德興染料廠訂立合同，由該廠將此項廢砲彈中炸藥設法取出，廢鐵交由海軍上海工廠另作別用，炸華則歸大德興廠，其中苦味酸成份可供製造染料之用。自八月十六日開始，該廠即在廢砲彈堆置之處設鍋鑪用蒸氣熱化，先後已化開一百九十五枚，至昨日又取七十六枚續化。在出事前負責看管鍋鑪之該廠老司務柏芳龍因吃中飯離去，交由小工金人泰代爲看管。未幾鍋鑪及砲彈即同時轟然爆炸，其原因或係小工一時疏忽，鍋鑪溫度超過二百度所致。當爆炸時，彈片四飛，除小工金人泰等兩人當塲炸斃外，並有暨南大學學生四人及路人兩名受彈片炸傷。死者後經掩埋，傷者送市立第四醫院洽療。大德興染料廠經理唐性存已由警局帶局偵訊。</p>

<h3>戰時在楓涇作惡多端　日戰犯松谷昨執行槍決　臨刑之前淋浴寫遺書剪頭發指甲寄與親屬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日籍戰犯松谷義盛，卅歲，日本廣島縣人，在作戰期間，担任日米駐杭州松江派遣隊中士附員，派駐觀涇鎭，兼充僞組織指導官，專事搜括轄區米糧，殘殺平民，擾害鄕民，民國卅四年陰曆二月十一日，有千田婆鄕鄕民徐阿賴，由鄰村耀米五斗，肩負返家，適値松谷下鄕勒紫米糧，中途相遇，誣徐爲米販，加以毒打後，拘押於楓涇僞警所，兩月後將徐提至楓涇鎭市郊天主堂南首空地上，以軍刀向其背腹等處猛刺九刀，繼以斬首，同年三月二十日，復率便衣士兵至姜家浜美杏松家，以搜捕地下工作人員爲名，將姜住屋十八間縱火焚毀，並持械嚇縈施救。同年四月十一日上午，復率十餘便衣日兵，赴一　鄕黃泥浜張否明家，意圖勒索米糧，張杏明遙見彼等前來，知非善意，乃立將大門鎖閉，已則定避屋外，幾探動靜，及松谷等到達，見大門外鎖，遂率兵毀門入內，片刻間忽見火焰養穿屋頂，未及三小時，全部虜戰，悉付一炬。同日松谷又至芥圩鄉副鄕長王岳祺家，勒索食米十餘担，捷至王周氏家，勒索食米二十餘祖，均不給價，亦不付與收據。同年四月間，又赴楓林鄉湯泥婆養字圩地方，勒索米糧未遂，兗將全村民房縱火焚燒，數十戶中僅三家倖免。勝利後經當地公民凌競星等檢舉扣押，由國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭庭長石美瑜審訊明晣，以罪證確緊，判處死刑，並呈奉蔣總統核准，令飭執行。昨上午十一時，由該庭檢察官施泳，偕同書記官郭鎭箕，通譯官王仁明，並武裝憲兵一班，前往提籃橋上海監獄，將松谷自獄中提出，松谷已知末日來臨，乃請准沐浴更衣後，穿軍服，着長統皮靴，白翻領襯衫，隨同外出，渠體格修偉，戴玳　邊眼鏡，蓄髮，請神亦頗旺健。公案臨時設置於特刑庭第一法庭內，迨開庭，由檢察官宣吿執行後，松谷即要求寫遺書三通，一致其家屬吿別，一致江灣三百難友，另一封則給其親愛之僚屬津口君二。寫畢後，並當庭剪下指甲及頭髮少許，連同鋼筆一枝，均置放於信封內，寫明交岡村寗次一併轉交其在日親屬，至此檢察官即宣吿退庭，將松谷押至邢塲，時松谷猶引吭高歌，及槍聲一響則已倒臥於血泊中，時爲午時三刻正，該犯屍體當“即經收埋；松谷臨刑前受訊（中央社攝）</p>

<h3>江南鐵路京蕪段復軌通車記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　康風</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖卅日快訊〕以革命元老退休，而從事工礦交通事業的張靜江老先生，念念不忘他主辦的江南鐵路復軌通車。七月初江南鐵路公司在美所買鋼軌及配件到滬，隨即在加拿大所買枕木亦到。公司的代總經理周緊頌亦由美飛抵上海，爲了加緊配合建立江南總體戰戰備，公司決定在五十天以內先使京無段通車。</p>
<p>七月十二日由南京中華門車站開始舖軌，在這以前，交通部已命令兩路局優先把「江南」的鋼軌枕木趕運到南京。在許多別的事件上交部都予以協助。七月十二日開始在拆去鋼軌二年半的京蕪段路基上，把七十五磅鋼軌一條一條舖上去。魚尾板裝好，螺絲釘旋緊，釘道隊第一批前進，第二批起道的就來把枕木放置在舖好的鋼軌下，再用道釘釘牢。</p>
<p>一天二公里</p>
<p>就運樣，一天二公里，釘道隊在三輛貨車作成的工程專車指揮下，由南京向西到蕪湖來，他們過江寗鎭，過銅井，慈湖，進入安徽省當塗縣境的采石，馬鞍山，當塗，大橋，終於在八月廿七日到了蕪湖這大江滾滾的江邊車站。計算時間正好在五十天以內。</p>
<p>四十五天緊張趕工中，釘通隊的員工們從領隊的正工程司王毓琛起，到拿織鎬鐵錠起軌鎚釘的工人止，人人都晒得焦黑，幸好路綫平坦，又是舊基復軌，橋樑工程也早完成，故釘道很平安的進展。有十來個爲枕木鋼軌碎石弄破身上皮骨的，即刻就由隨車的殷醫生接骨數藥包紥好了。</p>
<p>短短的京蕪段九十公里正綫，十公里側綫中，每公里要用枕木一千五百四十根，總計用了十五萬多根枕木。用了在美所購的七十五磅鋼軌七千三百噸。因爲不够，又搜羅路上舊存的六十磅鋼軌七百噸，速魚尾板道釘等零件總計鋪下去九千噸鋼製品，其他沿綫電話綫架設，京無站電燈裝製，站房修理，月台整頓都在進行。爲了加同路基，在銅井站開山鑒石把石碴塡補在路基較薄的地段。</p>
<p>不滿七百人</p>
<p>這些工程在周賢　親自指揮下及王毓琛率領下，以四十多名管理員工，三百名釘道隊工人，一百五十名起道錦枕木工人，以及在南京中華門裝材料上車向前供應的一百六十多工人合計不滿七百人，四十五天究成正側綫一百公規復軌工作！八月廿七日工棚就到了蕪湖江邊車站，工人們在下弦月的微光中，在理着最後一段。那綠帳蓬連綿如軍營，下半夜他們渡勞身軀即睡在裏而，夏夜熒香·稻香在夜風中吹拂他們黑油油的身軀，雖然不是直接予以營養的維他命香味，實也是江南八月秋收鄕村對他們來自城市的勞動者默默的迎接禮物呢！</p>
<p>一切都得趕快，這是現代企業精神！。八月廿八日上午八時及下午四時半，蕪湖與南京各開出不分等級的客車一列，這一天往來京蕪路的旅客們，以一圓五角的低價換取了平穩的火車旅行。旣不當心拋錨，更不當心生命會在司機偶爾的疏忽下給拋下九泉，旅客們嗅着江南秋收的滿田野稻香。看着如畫的豐收景象，白鵝黃鷄在池塘田間矯健的啄食，都恍如回復到戰前寗靜生涯裏。</p>
<p>車務段王毓瓚段長說到他們的運務預計是在這九·十兩個月內，預計客運每日供應三千到四千乘客的二個月以後一切正常了，希望能提高到五千乘客一天售票量（即每年供應一百八十萬旅客旅行）。貨運方面預計運出的爲農產品米，菜籽，鵝鴨毛等，日約三百噸，年運量十一萬噸。運入的爲供應蕪湖電燈所用淮南煤斤及淮鹽，百貨布疋棉紗等，日約一百噸，月爲三千噸。現爲客貨運方面正與京滬路接洽聯運事宜。戰前兩路局堯化門站有聯運綫通江南的中華門站能復軌，今後皖南農村輸出品可以在無裝車後一直到上海了。上海來的內銷工業品亦不必經南京卸裝直到蕪湖。</p>
<p>不過是開始</p>
<p>這些已完成的與即做的只不過是聞始。目前軌已復，能供通車的計機車十二台，新買美製鋼皮客車十九輛，貨車改裝三等車七輛，舊客車新條者六輛，貨車在貨運展開後可以供應無缺。周賢頌代總經理談到這路創辦人張靜江老先生，雖然雙目已近完全失明狀態，但他老人家却看出中國是光明的，許多新興事業就要代替血戰的悲慘局面。這老人家要他的事業對民生國計有利，要他的事業能創就一批一批可以更新封建中國的年靑人物，他即使雙目看不出光明，心地也是有一福光明景色在望的！</p>
<p>第三個喜訊</p>
<p>戰節這條鐵路已通車到宣城孫家埠，舖軌已過皖南徽州山區到達江西的瓷都眾德鎭，而欲與浙贛鐵路在鷹潭站接軌。抗戰把修好的徽州區鐵軌拆了，京蕪宣段淪陷。勝利後接收不到三個月，就爲了別路的需要拆去這六十磅輕軌，使京蕪靠小輪與顧簸的卡車連繫。如今在秋收與金圓問世二喜下，江南鐵路復軌到蕪湖，才眞是旅客們的第三喜呢！</p>
<h3>從新角度勘察煤都焦作　（完續）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報焦作廿八日快訊〕當日午後，李廠長陪我下井，我穿起了藍布的工人服裝，戴上用藤條編起來的「柳條帽」，拿着手杖和手電筒，走到五百英尺深的地下去。</p>
<p>這裏是煤的世界，幽暗的電燈光，在有力無力地發着光，我們沿着主要的行道，向西南走去，一輛輛的煤軍，在軌道上滑溜着，從我們的身旁擦過，行道的高度和寬度照標準是九尺高，十一尺寬，但是有些地方却很低，因此走過去必得低頭，我有時候因爲顧着談話，沒有注意，因此頭碰了十多次，這裏礦井的佈署採用房柱法，每一百公尺見方留一個煤柱，沿着行道兩側，每隔一百公尺，向左右兩方鑽道開採，行道中用木柱支撑，兩旁各一根，上面一根，其距離視煤質及頂壓而定，平均約爲四公寸，木柱是全部礦井的靈魂，沒有它，無法生產，而如果計算不準確，支柱時稍一疎忽，更關係千百個礦工的生命。在目前，木柱的需要，也正是礦方最難解決的一個問題。據一般計算，礦中要出十噸煤，就得用六根木段（即兩組），而焦作的附近，由於戰時的軍事需要及鐵路需要，樹木早就砍光，最近礦方的高價收購，規定五根木段可以換一噸煤，可是木段來源依然有限，所以礦方只有拆不不重要的煤洞的支柱，來應付目前的需要，支撑煤層的柱子，在礦井中俗名「棚子」，它是礦務方面最受注意的一件東西，有專人每日負責查看。因爲由於上面煤層逐漸下壓，不堅實的煤層，便容易掉下一塊塊的煤，而可能把棚子壓塌。記者經過若干處，看到樑柱的上面，有很大的空隙，都用木段塡塞，就是這種工作。</p>
<p>王封井的主要行道東北行約四百英尺，西南行約四千英尺，我們順着煤層的坡度，向西南走了約一千七百英尺，傾斜度在十度左右，隨後復折而西南行，以十五度的傾斜角到採煤的地方，這一段電燈很少，煤工終年生活於煤堆中，他們看不到日光，可是他們在地下却帶了無限的光和熱給予人們。</p>
<p>因爲交通的窒息，限制了煤的生產量，現在井中已不再開新洞了，單就</p>
<p>老洞開採</p>
<p>已足够應付目前的需要，採礦的主要工具是鐵鑽和炸藥，煤塊炸下來後，就用運煤的「元寳車」，從鐵軌上推到幷口，再用捲揚機吊上，送到煤廠中去，在坡度特陡的地方，煤車則用電動絞車拖。</p>
<p>從岩層申的裂縫中漏到井下的水的處理，也是礦務中重要的工作。記者下井的那天，隔夜大兩，所以井中的積水特別多。下井的當兒，四壁淅瀝之聲有如大雨，井下的鐵軌兩旁積水有數寸之深，正向着原房中的水池裏流着，原房裏的電動機不停地在工作，它一分鐘可以抽去積水五噸，應付道一些積水是毫無問題的。</p>
<p>在井下停留了五十分鐘，記者也帶着滿臉的煤回到地上來，在礦井附近還有電動選購機，現在因爲產量少，用不到它，選煤的工作，因爲節省支出，不用工人，而是由李發宗廠長領導全體員工，作養務勞動，選煤機下面舖就了輕便軌，從這裏接到新焦鐵路，在正常時候運煤極便，新焦綫斷後，運煤的支綫也閒着到現在，鐵軌上生了銹，枕木間長起來一堆堆的靑草。</p>
<p>目前焦作礦，每日產一二百噸煤，一部是礦上自已消耗了，變成動力，一部份是用着來應付外界的，在焦作的各機關，水，電，煤，中福公司得無條件供應，這種消耗，每月要煤四千噸以上，剩下來的數十噸到一百噸，只是應付零販商，用大車或人力運到新鄉販賣。</p>

<h3>實行出口貨限價後　桐油國外市况好轉　各商行最近在漢口大量收購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會方面透露：過去數週內，我國桐油之出口，因出口商人之競銷，及國外進口商之抑價，國外行情已日趨下游，紐約市價每磅竟跌至一角八分美元。幣制改革後，有關當局即實行出口貨物限價辦法，以防商人低價競銷，造成海外行情之繼續跌落，現悉桐油之紐約市價，已昇至每磅美金二角以上。</p>
<p>又訊：桐油內銷季節，已成落令，日來門銷，極度淸稀，外銷前途已現樂觀。聞漢口方面自幣制改革後，各出口行駐漢行號，即大量吸收，過去數日中，每日均有五六千担成交，估計總數祗少已有三萬担以上，現漢口油價，每担爲六十八元八角，另加匯費運雜抵滬成本約爲七十六元左右，杭州油價開七十三元五角，另加運滬運費與漏耗，亦與漢口來價相仿。如照出口限價C.R.F.每磅二角，F.O.B.角八分，可望大量輸出。</p>

<p>昨日米市，北市略堅而南市稍疲，與上日南堅北疲之情形相反。北市因上日價較低賤，米店均赴北市選購，因此去路甚佳，價格乃見提升。上白粳及高薄稻，略升二三角，中次貨挺四五角，新粳去化不活，僅中次貨加起一二角。南市塲初市與上日相仿，惟店方少取，去路甚呆，收市即因此而略跌。厚薄稻各微挫二三角，白元仍堅定。昨日南北市到貨，共計三一七八石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>因社會局限制老棧單，即日起停止交易，並限七日內出貨，但同業因覺期限太短，難以如期辦理，昨日特召開臨時會員大會，決定要求寬放期限，一方面請同業先將棧單登記，交易因此而無開出，聞兵船粉喊價下跌爲六元五角，大包麩皮以五元二角五分做開。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>大致按限價交易，但因供應稀少，交易更見淸淡，黃豆產地價高，貨主大都少售意，成交不多。荼豆僅有本街零星去化，價按限盤。蠶豆價無上落，揀靑無供應，苞米烟台帮納取，價格與上日彷彿，交易尙多。元麥成交不多，去略平常，價亦平定。芝蔴僅有本街去化，按限成交。生仁實行限制轉口，廣帮不取，故無交易，價格尙平。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>棧單貨，豆菜油平疲，因棧單將禁止交易，執有者心見甚軟，續有吐售。豆菜油初堅後疲，結果與上日價格相同，呈平疲之象。生油市堅，凈生油站限價，開出不多。小車蔴油竟無貨供應，致乏交易。豆餅市勢堅昂，各牌餅一律限價站住。</p>
<h3>銀根仍極鬆動行局略有差進</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根仍極鬆動，四行二局一庫於銀錢業票據交換中有少量差進，總額共十八萬。計中央銀行差出一五三萬，中國銀行差進一六六萬，交通銀行差進二八萬，農民銀行差出十七萬，中信局差進三萬，郵政局差進四萬，中央合作金庫差出十三萬。商業行莊大交換差出一〇八萬，小交換差出四四萬，外商銀行共計差進四六萬。</p>
<h3>國家行局內匯率明日起再度抑低</h3>
<p>中央銀行等國家行局內匯率，明日起對福州等地再度抑低如下：福州每千元四十元（原五十元），廣州二十元（原二十五元），汕頭二十五元（原三十元），長沙三十五元（原五十元），衡陽沅陵四十元（原五十元），漢口三十（原五十元），重慶成都三十五元（原五十元），萬縣自流井四十元（原五十元），靑島二十元（原十元）烟台二十五元（原十元），南昌九江吉安三十五元（原五十元），杭州三元（原五元），寗彼五元（原八元），合肥蕪湖二十元（原四十元），蚌埠二十五元（原三十五元），開封鄭州洛腸四十元（原五十元），貴陽四十元（原五十元），昆明三十五元（原五十元），西寗寗夏康定稚安歸綏迪化哈密二十元（原三十元）。</p>
<h3>國行拋售特砂白</h3>

<h3>貨款非法利用</h3>
<p>承貸銀行應負聯帶責任</p>
<p>中央銀行辦理同業貼放暫行規則，業經四聯總處通過。據中央銀行負責人談：此項暫行規則之主旨，係爲配合政府財政經濟緊急處理辦法，健全同業放款業務，控制利率，扶助生產，並鼓勵日用必需品及出口物資之流通。銀行申請辦理重貼現轉質押轉押匯，其放款總額均不應超過實收資本，及上月份平均存款總額。放款對象，亦較過去嚴格，原放款利率以不超過月息三分爲限。重貼現轉質押得按原貸款利率六折至八折辦理，至重貼現轉質押之折扣，按原貸額七折至九折。如貸款廠商運用資金於非生產途徑或囤積居奇，經查明處分，承貸銀行應負聯帶責任。以上所述，均爲此次改訂同業貼放規則之重要意義。</p>
<h3>國家行局開發本票亦須提存十足頭寸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市中國銀行上海分行等六國家行局庫，前曾申請開發本票時，得免受當日本票餘額必須有十足頭寸存放央行或票據交換所之限制。此事業經上海金管局核轉財政部指復不得例外，現該局已令各該行局庫遵辦。</p>
<h3>存款準備金利息已减為月息二分</h3>
<p>行莊存款準備金，中央銀行仍按銀行法規定辦理，活期收百分之十五，定期收百分之十。利息已减低爲月息二分。</p>
<p>國行稽該處頃發義盒月份全國各行莊存款及準備金總額比較表如次：活期存款二三，一八七，三三九，七九五，七大一·一〇元，定期存款四，三三九，八二五，四八四，九二九·六二元，存款總額二七，五二七，一六五，二八〇，六九〇·九二元，已繳準備金三一，八一五，四四八，九三一，八二三·三五元。</p>
<h3>木材行市况轉堅</h3>
<p>木材行市，依然平定無波，惟人心已較前爲堅。如杉木條子高檔貨一角二分有不肯脫手者，僅次貨尙能應市。聞杉木在福建產本仍高，杉木特條，抵滬成本須合一角七分，而滬售僅一角四五分。</p>
<h3>棉紗交易轉旺　布疋買賣仍陷停頓狀態</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗塲內交易轉旺，因市上銀根鬆濫，雖有紡建公司開售，複製商及客帮均有吸胃，市價全依限交易，公會方面現正要求當局轉知紡建公司，及民營紗廠，增加供源，調整合法利潤，人心因此已較緩和，昨日做開粗細紗二十二種，計四十三件半。　又訊：紡建公司續有粗紗四種開配，計十支富貴價爲四百九十元，十六支三羊價五百八十五元，二十支金雙鷄·奔騰，價同爲六百四十五元，每戶限購一件，故申請者甚爲踴躍。</p>
<p>棉布市仍陷於停頓狀態，塲內以市價大都抵達漲限，自動休市，惟少數經紀人欲搜求低檔雜脾細布，終以賣戶絕跡，無從成交，間或因事實上之需要，自願以四君子元嗶嘰加一元貼換龍頭細布。</p>
<p>又訊二前日紡建公司供售之各布，挨號居多，如陽鶴Ｂ字細布，跳鯉藏靑嗶嘰，玩傘漂布，及大另特荷花女等，每種每戶得配一件，因此市上籌碼不充。　又訊：布業信大祥及寳大祥批發號商等，龍頭細布售價廿九元五角，四君子元嗶嘰廿八元五角，照限供應，惟須拆包剪斷，以防流弊。</p>
<p>又訊：紡循例售紗十三種，共計一四二〇件，金額爲一，三四七，一〇三元。中紡九月三日起，棉紗掛號（複製廠），改上午九時半，十時半截止請購單，又自九二日起，棉布提早於十時掛牌，十一時收單。</p>

<h3>敦煌藝術</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>國立敦煌藝術研究所自八月二十四日至廿九日在南京中央研究院開展覽會，出品完全撫摹敦煌千佛洞壁書，分爲攝影，歷代壁畫代表作選集，歷代藻井·花邊·佛光的圖案，歷代蓮座，及有關風俗的歷代伎樂·山水人物·舟車·建築資料·服飾·和動物·飛天等項目，出品不下千點，特別是摹寫壁畫一項，色彩，形狀，和原畫不爽毫黍，幾乎使我們如置身莫高窟中，較之那些只描其一鱗半爪便自炫新奇的是不可同日而了。</p>
<p>敦煌自北魏起至唐未止，乃中國西北一國際都市，讀向達先生「唐代長安與西域文明〕一書可以知其詳細。李唐的民族近已經人考定爲西北的外族，不過已經十分漢化。但他對於胡人並不像從前各朝代的排斥，唐初建功的大臣，外族人甚多，（尉遲敬德是最有名的，其先出自北魏，而始祖則是西域於關。）故彼時中國有好幾個大城市，都是外人盛集之區，如廣·揚州是胡人從海舶來中土的居留地，洛陽·長安則是自西方來的胡人所羣居，敦煌是中國與西域的分界，故各國來華人士，多居於此。他們一方面向慕華化，一方面也把胡風傳至中國，唐朝音樂·歌舞·服裝·遊戲·飲食，無一不沾染胡風，也彷彿今日我國上流社會以洋化爲講究一樣，越是達官貴人，胡化的越深。一般我們全認爲中國在唐代是文敎最盛之際，不知其時外國文化，正和中國平分秋色。現在我們看了敦煌壁畫中唐代的外國王子，外國化的佛像，和各種樂舞，更使我們對於那時的胡風增一深刻的印證。以佛像而論，其構圖，服飾等，絕不類今日的呆滯，全身比例及面容，有好些儼然如今日洋畫家所寫的模特兒，使我們增加一人的感覺」，而不是荒唐的迷信，在美妙諧和之中，透露了無上的圓滿，經文所說的莊嚴妙相，於此才護眞</p>
<p>魏隋和初唐的圖畫充滿雄偉的氣魄，例如佛傳故事中有兩種，一名「菩薩委身喂餓虎」，一名「五百强盜故事一，前者是大家都曉得的，後者記五百强盜被捕，受剜目之刑，後因皈依佛法，得獲復明，這兩幅連續故事畫，其綫條之粗獷和構圖之大胆，處處表現初民藝術之特色，絕不像明淸以來畫家或畫匠所繪的那麼懦弱無生氣，簡直像一副睜着眼睛的死尸。這種連環畫方式，眞應爲今日藝術家所取資。中華民族過於古老，血液體格已趨停滯而袞朽，必須有新的血球灌轍一下，才可甦生，與其遠自歐美稗販，不如求之先民。我看上述連續性的故事畫，自宋代以後，就漸漸猥瑣無力氣，同樣佛出家故事，宋人所畫的是區區小幅，沒有勇氣，沒有精神，遠遜隋唐的連貫作畫方法，筆觸更不能相頡頏。與宋代同時的西夏佛畫，似乎稍有勝處，其藻井圖案等竟較隋唐無媿色，可見新興民族氣魄與衰靡者太不相同。不禁使我們由藝術而聯想到其他各部門上去。</p>
<p>教煌藝術及文獻自伯希和斯坦因等外人的渲染而大著於世，可憐中國的考古家，直等到伯希和在北京六國飯店把刦掠來的寳物開一次展覽會大吹法螺之後才曉得西陲有這樣一個寳庫。但距今五六十年，斯坦因早已將所得印成The　Thousand　Buddahs（千佛圖錄），伯希和也印有極精的敦煌圖錄，就連日本的東方文化研究所也印有一教煌畫之研究」一種。伯·斯兩氏之書，精美絕倫，價比兼金。日人的也有八百除頁，插圖四百餘幅，不能不使吾人感到愧汁。今試以敦煌研究所的成績爲基礎，印製一種比較完美的敦煌岡錄，不特足以保存無窮的國寳，抑且可使藝術家，考古家增加無窮的資料，私人力量有限，政府似乎不該恝然不理。我站在讀者的立塲上，是畫夜企求其實現的。</p>
<p>深藏在田納西羣山之中的橡樹嶺（Oak　Ridge）美國的原子彈工廠的一個單位。這裏門禁森嚴，大門由一輛爲保安警察所控制的裝甲車把守着，它用無綫電話和中央的保安總部及各孤立區域的每一個「神經中樞」連絡。</p>
<p>這裏是一橡樹嶺國家實騐院」的所在地，它是原子核研究中心的一部份。它由一百五十幢建築物組成。在一幢灰色的小房子裏存放着「原子堆</p>
<p>（Atompile）所謂「原子堆」者，就是內藏着提鍊過的鈾礦的石墨磚，這些石墨磚都是一塊一塊的淮積起來的，因而造成「原子堆」這個名詞。</p>
<p>橡樹嶺的原子堆專供生產放射性的物質，以供軍備，工業，醫藥和其他方面試騐或實用。它所含有的潛存的能量比全世界的火車頭的總能量還大，放出來的輻射能相當於一百萬磅鐺。</p>
<p>橡樹嶺的產物也運送到華盛頓州的漢福去製造　（Plutonium），和運送到洛薩拉莫斯（Los　Alamos）去製造原子彈。</p>
<p>在橡樹嶺原子的物質是用兩種不同的方法製造的。其中一種由「電磁工廠　承造。</p>
<p>電磁工廠離研究中心有六哩之遙（所有的大單位都由山嶺隔離，以减低爆炸的危險）。它又稱Y-12工廠，共有一百七十幢建築物，建築時耗資四億美金——比巴拿馬運河開藝的費用還多。在興建的時候，因爲美國缺銅，所以便向美國財政部借了價値近乎五億元的銀子做導電體之用。這些銀子到現在依然在那裏。</p>
<p>這個世界上獨一無二的工廠專司將鈾235與鈾238分離出來的工作。它有上千的複雜的機蓋，由數千男女工作人員管理着。不過，每人祗管理簡單的一小單位，對全盤的機器是茫然無知的。</p>
<p>這裏的水力廠之大也是蓋世無雙的。它的發電量有「田納西流域管理局」（即ＴＶＡ）最大的「諾里斯壩一的一倍。</p>
<p>在另外一座山嶺那邊是K-25工廠，它與「電磁工廠」爲姊妹廠，不過，它不用電磁法製造原子物質，而用氣態分佈法製造。它計有建築物七十幢，其中那幢四層高的主要建築物是地球上最大的單幢工廠。這幢大厦作Ｕ字形，兩翼長一哩半，闊一百三十三碼。在它的鄰近有一幢複製的工廠，不過大小僅爲它的四分之一。這兩個單位中都擺滿了萬分精確的機械。它們的目的是將鈾235從鈾的化合物中大規模的分離出來。</p>
<p>在大昂廠裏，鈾首先被變成氣體，然後再被變成固體。</p>
<p>眞正的原子分裂是用强迫氣體通過數千精細得令人難以置信的篩獲得的。每一面篩面有數十億個比兩百萬分之一方吋還細小的孔。</p>
<p>整個的機構絕對的防止洩漏機密。防止洩漏的偵查設備極其週密，如果把這種設備移裝在一個大都市中，那麼，任何一家門鈴響了，一架電梯昇降，一盞電燈明暗，一架電話被用或者一扇窗戶破裂，中央控制室都會得到警報。</p>
<p>橡樹嶺不過是美國原子彈工廠的一個單位而已，其工程之浩大與組織之週密已令人嘆爲觀止；整個的原子彈工廠更不知如何的複雜與龐大呢！</p>

<h3>邱吉爾論酒·</h3>
<p>— 淸</p>
<p>一九四三年一月，羅斯福和邱吉爾舉行了歷史上著名的卡薩白朗加會議</p>
<p>會議期中，有一天早晨，羅斯福因事派他最親信的幕　霍布金斯去和邱吉爾接洽。霍布金斯走到邱吉爾的寓所時，微微吃了一驚！</p>
<p>原來這位雄才大略的英國首相尙未起身。他身穿粉紅色睡衣，躺在牀上吃東西。</p>
<p>而邱吉爾的早餐竟是一瓶美酒！</p>
<p>霍布金斯忍不住就問邱翁，一淸平就吃酒算是什麽意思？</p>
<p>邱翁答道：他一向對牛奶極抱惡感，對一瓶好酒倒並不對厭。仔細衡量之後，決定還是吃酒。他說：他年已六十八歲，身體素來壯健，在他整個一生之中，他覺得醫生們的勸吿倒是靠不住的時候多。他說，淡酒也好，烈酒也好，無論如何是不戒的了——現在如此，將來還是如此。</p>
<h3>皮曹學彼荟</h3>
<p>二十日公在改幣，二十二日銀行開門以來，平市情形大致可　。以金銀及美鈔赴兌者踴躍而前，尤其以銀兩換新券者，最爲擁擠。因白銀私市價格，一向比銀元低下甚多，此次規定突高於銀元（純銀一兩可換新券三元，銀元一枚則換二元。與二十日以前幾爲反比洌），故持有白銀者喜出望外。其銀元兌率（六百萬法幣）雖略少於前之私市（七，八之間），但國行收兌，於小疵不甚挑剔，且許多學生及宅卷等，前幾個月買到手時本爲及時濟用，待價而沽，則此時之官價，比其買時之私價，已贏餘三倍以上，宜其欣欣然也。黃貨新官價亦甚優待（新劵二百，合法幣六億，比私價高），故乘此出手者亦多。至於舊幣（法幣止於萬元，市面實際已廖寥，惟「關老爺」尙多耳）則兌者反較遲緩，一則兌期較長（有三個月光陰），二則新券小額輔幣尙未露容，三則物價未甚改變，習用較爲便利。例如十萬一塊的豆腐，若標新幣則「三分」之下有除不盡之三三三三……等小數，如新的小票發行，或照「五進，四棄一之例，則須退至九萬一塊，但商人之心理，則期待進至「四分一，故舊幣之遲其兌，緩其期，於官家與商民兩方，似皆爲有益。且舊幣雖値輕，而數目大，留之以襯起新小券之身分，未嘗無「烘雲托月」之妙用。</p>
<p>羣衆對新券之感興趣，因久爲煩冗無已之數目字而疲倦，忽復覩「幾角」「幾分」之物價，眞有回轉「好年月」之印象。因自春及夏，普通買賣論價，亦由「萬」而進到論「億」，其勢將使「億京兆垓」連類而起。經此次改革，先將「億」字退入冷宮，「京」「兆」云云，更不必出頭，而洋行貨店玻璃窗內，每件標價許多「圈」「圈」「圈」如讀天文計算太陽噸數者，而今亦見全部縮短，少畫「　」，多點小數，可稱耳目一新。</p>
<h3>張子祥與馮超然</h3>
<p>— 胡亞光</p>
<p>從前，上海白克路一家剃頭店裏，有一個學徒，常常偸偷的溜到隔壁一家裱畫店去看畫。老板查問起來，東找西找，好容易在裱畫店裏找到了，便一把拖到到店裏，拳足交加。但是不多幾時，又是故態復萌。後來凡是不見了他，索性直奔裱畫店而來，總是十拿九穩的。你道這學徒是誰？便是現在鼎鼎大名的畫家馮超然啊！那時張子祥也在上海賣畫，常到這家裱畫店去的，每次看到這樣一個小學徒模樣的人，在看書畫，而且看得又那麼出神，認爲奇怪，打聽得是隔壁剃頭店裏的學徒，有一天，張子祥便問他爲什麼這樣歡喜看畫。馮超然便含淚回答：實在是喜歡學畫，祗是環境不許可。張子祥便呌他把平時書的東西拿來看看。馮超然就拿了一大束，什麼山水，花卉，人物，仕女，都很像樣。張子祥拍案呌絕，便很爽直的呌他脫離剃頭店，願意敎他學畫。後來超然不但畫得很好，能够靑出於籃，而對於書法題詞，也相當成功。這個雖是張子祥提拔後進之功，然而不是超然的天資卓越，又肯努力向上，那有今日的成就呢！</p>

<h3>U.S. Aid Industrial Component Grant; Four Units First to Receive Assistance; Kailuan Mines, Yangzi Electric Power, Jibei Electric Power, and Taiwan Sugar Company; A Total of $4.4 Million Allocated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yan Jiagan, a member of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, Raymond Lapham, Director of the ECA China Mission, and Leighton Stuart, Director of the Construction Survey Team of the Mission, jointly held a press conference at the China Hotel here at 10:00 AM yesterday, announcing that among the $35 million in grants for industrial components, the first to receive assistance are Kailuan Mines, Yangzi Electric Power Company, Jibei Electric Power Company, and Taiwan Sugar Company.

<p>Importance of the Four Units</p>
<p>Yan Jiagan first described the importance of the businesses of the four units:</p>
<p>(1) Yangzi Electric Power Company, including the Qishuyan Power Plant, supplies electricity to the Nanjing Qishuyan area. Due to a shortage of components, the power generation is insufficient to meet the industrial needs of the area. It is now legally allocated $1.2 million to increase production and promote employment opportunities in the area. The project is undertaken by Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>(2) Kailuan Mines Company, the amount of coal supplied by the mine accounts for 50% of the national coal production. Today, in addition to being the main coal source in North China, it is also the supply base of coal for Central China (including Shanghai). Shanghai's electricity is the source of its industry. Therefore, Shanghai's fuel supply relies on Kailuan coal. However, the current situation of the mine is extremely bad. If it is not actively repaired, the mining work will collapse as a whole. A special allocation of $1 million is made for renovation, and the project is undertaken by Jardine Engineering Corporation.</p>
<p>(3) Jibei Electric Power Company, this was originally one of the important projects of the National Resources Commission and is of great importance to the industrial production of North China. In the past, the company was unable to fully supply electricity due to a lack of important equipment. This time, a special allocation of $1.2 million is made to supplement it, and the project is undertaken by the Wiley &amp; Han Company.</p>
<p>(4) Taiwan Sugar Company, the importance of the company lies in its ability to export surplus sugar and earn valuable foreign exchange resources for the country. Therefore, $1 million is allocated to increase production. The entire project is undertaken by the American Transportation Corporation.</p>
<p>Yan said: The above four units and the allocated $4.4 million are just the beginning of the utilization of the $35 million in industrial component funds. On behalf of the government and the people, he expressed his gratitude to Raymond Lapham, Leighton Stuart, and the work and efforts of the ECA Mission. He also said: With the joint efforts and cooperation of the Chinese and American governments, the utilization of U.S. aid can achieve the greatest success.</p>
<p>Leighton Stuart's Speech</p>
<p>Leighton Stuart led the Construction Survey Team to extensively study the major needs of Chinese industry over the past three months. According to his statement, the above four types of enterprises are very important in the Chinese economy, so they were selected as the targets of the first batch of allocations. Stuart also said: "We have tried our best to select appropriate targets from among the many applicants for assistance, and our goal is to make the best use of our funds within a reasonable period of time. Furthermore, we have taken serious steps in the implementation, procurement, installation, and financial allocation of the project, so that everything we implement or sponsor can achieve perfect results, in order to increase production and benefit the Chinese people. Starting with these four types of enterprises is also a test of the plans and steps we intend to take, and to determine whether they are indeed effective in practice." Stuart then explained the procurement and transportation of industrial components. He said: All components that originally existed in China or that can be manufactured domestically will be utilized as a priority, in order to save foreign exchange. Even if it is necessary to purchase from abroad, it can be purchased from any country with superior efficiency in producing industrial components. The prerequisites are the price and the length of the delivery time. Regardless of whether the required materials are produced in China, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, or any other country. Stuart specially distributed the articles of the oath that commercial groups or government agencies participating in construction and industrial component plans should sign, explaining the U.S.'s purpose in revitalizing the world and promoting international trade. Stuart also said: This oath is a direct answer to the general public's so-called purpose of U.S. aid to open up markets for U.S. surplus materials.</p>
<p>Stuart explained in his written remarks yesterday: The Chinese and American governments have decided in principle to allocate $70 million specifically for industrial components and construction plans. The original plan was to allocate $10 million in the form of a grant for the procurement of components, and another $60 million in the form of a loan for construction. However, after on-site surveys, it is firmly believed that what China needs most today is the supply of components. The Chinese government also agreed with this, and as a result, $35 million of the $70 million was allocated in the form of a grant for components.</p>
<p>He said: "We have formulated a plan to ensure that the various industries that receive assistance can proceed smoothly in the procurement, transportation, installation, and use of raw materials and equipment, and that what is transported to China is not just materials for stockpiling in warehouses, but all practical components. And in the implementation of this plan, we can obtain the sincere cooperation of our Chinese colleagues."</p>
<p>Raymond Lapham Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>Raymond Lapham, Chairman of the reception, expressed his satisfaction at the meeting that the component replenishment and construction plans have begun to be implemented in China. He also said that this move will greatly improve China's economic situation.</p>
<p>Lapham also said: "This is a real beginning, and it is the product of in-depth research by many enthusiastic people. Under our limited economic capacity, they have tried their best to improve the current situation of this great country. The Survey Team has always received the assistance and cooperation of the Chinese government in its work. This kind of cooperation makes me firmly believe that from this small beginning, we will have a great future."</p>

<h3>The Key to Solving the German Problem</h3>
<p>4.  The constitutional convention has already opened in Bonn, the hometown of Beethoven, and will begin drafting a national democratic constitution in accordance with the provisions of the London Six-Power West German Agreement. Regardless of the outcome of the Moscow negotiations, or how the Berlin crisis may evolve in the future, the imminent birth of the "Second German Republic" is a major event in current international politics worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The recent uncertainty in the European situation is like the hail season, with alternating sunshine and rain, almost unpredictable. On the one hand, the Moscow negotiations have made progress and could have ended with a communiqué, but they were abandoned due to the sudden rise of the French political crisis. The haze in the international situation has not yet been completely swept away; in addition, the Soviet spy case occurred in the United Kingdom, causing both sides to close their consulates. Although it will not directly affect the Moscow negotiations, the deteriorating relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union seems to be increasingly evident. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin, because the Moscow negotiations have taken a turn for the better, is not as severe as before, and the Berlin crisis seems to be disappearing. However, the German Communists have been holding demonstrations in Berlin for days, breaking into the Berlin City Hall in an attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government of Berlin by force, causing a great uproar in Berlin, which has been rising and falling in crisis for more than sixty days. Although the four Allied commanders in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, also met the day before yesterday to discuss the unified currency system and the lifting of the blockade, the world does not place much hope on it. These bright and uncertain phenomena all illustrate the depression and subtlety of the European situation after the war.</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called German problem was originally a common problem for the Allied countries after the war. How to clean up the post-war European mess, how to control defeated Germany so that it cannot rise again to aggression, the interests of the Allied countries were originally completely consistent; however, after Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allied countries repeatedly held international conferences to discuss the German problem, but they never reached a common and consistent policy, so that the German peace conference has not yet been convened. Now, the so-called German problem has fundamentally changed its nature. Therefore, today's German problem has become a US-Soviet problem, and both sides regard Germany as an object to be won. Nothing is more strange than this. On the Western Allied side, from the merger of the three occupation zones to the currency reform in West Germany, they have always wanted to support the revival of the German economy, so that Germany can be their anti-communist vanguard in Europe, so that the Soviet Union's power cannot cross the border. However, on the Soviet side, they are doing everything possible to win people's hearts in their occupation zone, creating an anti-American psychology among the German people, and attempting to drive the United States, Britain, and France out of Berlin, so that the German Communists can organize a "People's Government" in Berlin, participate in the new Communist International, and engage in anti-American and anti-imperialist work. Therefore, the current crisis caused by the Soviet blockade of Berlin, strictly speaking, is a battle between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies, which has really exceeded the general so-called "Cold War."</p>
<p>From the day the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin, it has been more than two months, and the world is watching with bated breath for the Berlin situation to turn from danger to safety. But until now, we have only seen the negotiations in Moscow. From July 30th, the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have been conducting negotiations with Molotov and Stalin in Moscow, and it has only achieved a preliminary result. It cannot be said that it has done everything possible to circumvent and twist, and this result is only that Stalin agreed that the Western Allies should jointly control the currency in Berlin, and there is still a considerable distance from the solution of the Berlin problem. Perhaps, it may be a change in Soviet diplomatic tactics. Since the Soviet Union cannot force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin by means of blockade and intimidation, it will naturally have to change its tactics and rely on the German Communists. On the eve of the German Communists' entry into the Berlin City Hall, more than 3,000 representatives of the German Socialist Unity Party held a conference. The party leader, Pieck, not only criticized the Berlin City Government for resisting Soviet government orders, but also openly demanded that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin. Observing only from this perspective, the Soviet Union's intentions can be clearly seen.</p>
<p>In short, the Berlin crisis has not passed, and the future of the negotiations is not optimistic. The most urgent problem at present is to clarify the situation in Berlin. It is absolutely necessary to prevent any complications. If the actions of the German Communists are not stopped immediately, the Western Allies will never be able to fully trust the true intentions of the Soviet Union. The Soviet military commander in Berlin's refusal to the city government's request to delineate a neutral zone is particularly unwise. We believe that only under the condition of maintaining the status quo in Berlin can negotiations be conducted to achieve a solution. Therefore, the actions of the German Communists in Berlin are crucial to the success or failure of the four-power negotiations and are also the key to solving the German problem.</p>

<h3>The Yun Canal Embankment in Western Shandong Breached, Causing Widespread Flooding</h3>
<p>[Report from Jinan, this newspaper, 1st] Due to continuous thunderstorms, the canal water level rose. The embankment of the Yun Canal between Jining and Dachanggou in western Shandong suddenly breached, causing widespread flooding. Relief is urgently needed.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The autumn flood season of the Yellow River is approaching, and the Yellow River water level is rising. The embankments of Gao Village and Dongkou are extremely worrying. In addition, the Jiangsu Dam in Shandong Province was damaged by the rising water in Shanzhou, and the dam body has not yet been repaired. The dam is related to the safety of Henan, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, and needs to be repaired urgently. According to the Yellow River flood control project released by the Ministry of Water Resources, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau of the Ministry and the repair and prevention offices of various provinces under its jurisdiction are actively preparing for emergency repairs of the above-mentioned flood control projects. Gao Village in Hebei Province and Jiangsu Dam in Shandong Province have always been considered dangerous. The annual repairs this year have not been carried out due to repeated disturbances by the communist bandits. During the flood season, the water level rises, and the main flow hits the top, causing the embankments to collapse and the situation is critical. After receiving the report, the ministry repeatedly ordered the bureau to send personnel to follow the army to carry out emergency repairs. In late July, our repair and prevention personnel once arrived at Gao Village with the army to carry out emergency repairs, but on July 31, the national army in Dongming announced its transfer again, and the employees had no choice but to withdraw with the army, so the emergency repair work could not be carried out. The Jiangsu Dam area is also occupied by the communist bandits, and it is impossible to go to the construction site. The ministry has repeatedly asked the Ministry of National Defense to send troops to cover the area, and ordered the Yellow River General Bureau to supervise the repair and prevention personnel to contact the national army, follow the army to advance, and protect the area as the opportunity arises.</p>

<h3>If Berlin Negotiations Proceed Smoothly, Foreign Ministers' Meeting Possible; Four-Power Governors Hold Second Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington, 1st (Broadcast): Diplomatic circles predict that if the Berlin negotiations proceed smoothly, a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting will finally be held in Paris in late September. The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in Paris on September 19th, indicating that the meeting will provide an opportunity for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers to resume negotiations. It is generally hoped that discussions on technical issues related to Berlin currency and the lifting of the blockade will reach a satisfactory conclusion before the United Nations General Assembly convenes.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 1st] The U.S. military intelligence agency announced today that the second meeting of the Four-Power military commanders will be held at 5:00 PM today at the Berlin Control Council. The Four-Power military commanders' meeting is expected to establish several committees to study the issues discussed on the agenda, especially the establishment of a financial committee to study currency issues, and a transportation committee to study the restoration of traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones. However, according to Soviet officials on the Control Council who are close to Soviet news outlets, the Four-Power military commanders' meeting does not mean the restoration of the Four-Power Control Council. Furthermore, according to German sources, Berlin Soviet Commander General Kotikov has already instructed the Soviet Economic Committee and banks in the Soviet zone to take all necessary measures to make the new Soviet Mark circulate in the western districts of Berlin. It has also been learned that railway engineers are now inspecting the railway line on the border between Magdeburg and the Western occupation zone. This is seen by all parties as an indication that once the Moscow conference reaches an agreement allowing the lifting of the Berlin blockade, freight and passenger trains between the Western occupation zone and the Soviet zone will resume.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 1st] The Four-Power Transportation Committee discussed the lifting of the Berlin blockade on the 1st. According to reliable sources, Western supply trains may enter Berlin on the 5th. Berlin has been blockaded by the Soviets for seventy-four days to date.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 31st, United Press Dispatch] The governors of the four countries' military governments in Germany began their meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon. The first to arrive at the meeting was French Governor Koenig, followed by Soviet Governor Sokolovsky, who did not bring guards. British Governor Robertson, accompanied by his economic advisor, was protected by military police all the way to the entrance of the meeting. U.S. Governor Clay arrived last, accompanied by a political advisor, Murphy.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] The three powerful representatives stationed in the Soviet Union, U.S. Ambassador Smith, British Special Envoy Roberts, and French Ambassador Chataigneau, held a meeting lasting four hours this morning at the French Embassy here.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 31st] After 24 hours of intense activity, Western envoys began to rest on the afternoon of the 31st, and the Four-Power negotiations on Berlin have apparently entered a new stage.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the British Foreign Office in London stated that the "current stage" of the Moscow negotiations has come to an end. He said that there will be no more negotiations in Moscow until the four commanders-in-chief stationed in Germany agree on the details of the Berlin monetary system. At the same time, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and British Special Envoy Roberts refused to comment on the news that the heatwave of the Moscow negotiations had temporarily subsided. However, Smith and Roberts went to the British Embassy on the evening of the 31st to watch the British film "Anna Karenina," which was the first free time for Smith and Roberts in several days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 31st] The Berlin City Council decided today that it would not hold any more meetings before the publication of the communique from the Moscow Conference. The City Council also decided that it could not further discuss the proposal to establish a neutral zone until Berlin Soviet Commander Kotikov had responded to the proposal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 1st] None of the newspapers here today mentioned the statement issued by London regarding the preliminary results of the German question. Also, the British and American embassies here did not comment on the London statement.</p>

<h3>Wallace Does Not Give Up; Southern Speech</h3>
<p>Ignoring Crowds Throwing Eggs and Tomatoes</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] Third-party presidential candidate Wallace, while giving campaign speeches in the southern states, strongly stated that blacks should enjoy the same civil rights as whites, and the audience threw eggs and tomatoes at him. The police chief of Birmingham warned Wallace that local laws prohibit blacks and whites from listening to lectures at the same time. Wallace ignored this and still gathered black and white listeners together during his speech, which caused more eggs and sweet potatoes to be thrown. White House Secretary Ross quoted Truman's comments on the anti-Wallace demonstrations in the South today as saying: "This is a violation of American customs and a destruction of American traditions." However, Wallace declared that he would continue to deliver campaign speeches in the southern states without interruption.</p>

Japan has the newborn Korean Republic as its flank and the patriotic Philippines as its breakwater. Now, in this triangular fortress, Japan has become the mainstay, and before all people in the East, it demonstrates its democratic ideals." MacArthur also expressed his congratulations on Japan's progress under occupation for the past three years, and reiterated his opinion in last year's message, believing that Japan is a relatively stable oasis in the desert in a world of troubled times. The message concluded: "The progress made in the past three years proves that the East and the West are not entirely irreconcilable." Moreover, MacArthur's message did not mention China.</p>
<h3>Movie Star Jailed for Drug Use</h3>

<h3>Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting Concludes Suggestions on Italian Colonies Will Be Submitted to Foreign Ministers' Meeting Countries Have Divergent Opinions on This Issue</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] The meeting of the representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers held here has decided to submit the suggestions on Italian colonies to the meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers for discussion. The resolution of the meeting also mentioned China, one of the nineteen countries that expressed opinions on this issue.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] The meeting of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers, which began on August 9th to consider the issue of former Italian colonies, closed this evening at Lancaster House. A brief communique was issued that evening stating: "The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers will submit the suggestions agreed upon in the past three weeks to their respective governments." The communique was simple and the officials remained silent. It is generally believed that this must be due to the fact that the delegations of the four countries had very different opinions on the future of the former Italian colonies. According to reliable observers, this difference of opinion was caused by the attitude of the British delegation, because the French and Soviet delegations repeatedly supported the return of the former Italian colonies to Italy, while the British strongly opposed this solution. The reason why the British delegation insisted on this attitude was entirely due to the strategic importance of the status of the former Italian colonies.</p>
<h3>Southern Cabinet Reshuffle Vice Premiers Increased to Three</h3>

<h3>French National Assembly Passes Vote of Confidence Schumann Coalition Cabinet Socialist Party Meets and Decides to Join New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 1st] French Prime Minister Schumann stepped up his efforts on the 1st to organize a "streamlined" coalition cabinet to resist labor's wage increase and price reduction strikes. Schumann hoped to form a new cabinet on the 2nd, but still disagreed with the Socialist Party. Many Socialist Party leaders opposed the party joining Schumann's government, and Schumann calmly waited and dealt with it. The Socialist Party held a meeting on the morning of the 1st and immediately decided to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>At the same time, Schumann was looking for a finance minister. His initial intention was to find his old partner, Mayer, but Mayer had no intention of doing so, so Schumann would have to take on the post himself if necessary. As the political bargaining intensified, the pressure from the industrial sector also increased. The executive committee of the General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, decided to demand a wage increase, that is, a minimum monthly wage of 13,500 francs, starting from the 1st, with an increase of 33 percent. The Independent Confederation of Labor Unions decided that the minimum wage would be 13,400 francs and demanded the restoration of the free wage system. Non-Communist workers' groups also drafted demands, but the content is unknown. At the same time, short-term strikes occurred across the country.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 31st] The French National Assembly met today and passed the case of People's Republican Party leader Schumann taking charge of the prime minister's office with 322 votes against 185 votes. According to the Constitution, the required majority should be 311 votes.</p>

<h3>Economic Police Continue to Inspect Various Textile Factories; Yarn Stored in More Than Ten Factories Sealed; Chiang Ching-kuo Condemns Manufacturers for Not Selling and Taking a Wait-and-See Attitude; Decisive Measures Will Be Taken if They Continue to Delay</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the economic police brigade of the Police Department sealed up the public and private warehouses in the city that stored cotton cloth and cotton yarn for more than three months, yesterday it dispatched a large number of personnel to conduct surprise inspections of textile factories of all sizes in the city. It was found that more than ten factories, including the Yong'an Third Textile Factory, had stored a large amount of cotton yarn, which had also been stored for more than three months. The inspection personnel immediately sealed them one by one and reported them to the higher authorities for processing.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Supervisor Chiang Ching-kuo summoned the responsible persons of the China Textile Construction Company, Shu Yunzhang and Wu Weijing, at 10:00 AM yesterday to exchange opinions on the supply and price of cloth. Chiang pointed out at the time that since the implementation of price limits, cloth transactions have been rare, affecting the supply. Although the Textile Construction Company distributes cloth in a continuous stream, the cloth shops take a wait-and-see attitude after receiving the cloth, and the amount of cloth sold is not large, which is suspected of hoarding. He hoped that the Textile Construction Company could conduct a detailed investigation of this matter. At the same time, the private textile factories have sold very few finished products in recent days, and most of them are taking a wait-and-see attitude, which is not an attitude they should have. He hopes that these manufacturers can take into account the interests of the country and society and make some sacrifices. In the afternoon, Chiang summoned Wang Qiyu, a tycoon in the yarn industry, and instructed the private textile factories to sell a large amount of finished products. If the cost is insufficient, they can reduce the cost of cotton yarn production by suppressing the price of raw cotton and opening up sources of cotton. The current wait-and-see attitude of private textile factories is really undesirable. If the situation does not change, decisive measures will be taken in the shortest possible time to correct it.</p>
<h3>To Prevent the Smuggling of Goods; Police and Military Cooperate to Organize Inspection Stations</h3>

If any smuggling is found, in addition to confiscating all the goods, the instigator will also be severely punished. The inspection work began yesterday.</p>
<p>[Also] In order to make the above inspection work more detailed, Police Commissioner Yu yesterday specially ordered the Investigation Team of the Economic Brigade of the Bureau to draft inspection methods for the smuggling of goods by sea, land, air, and highway, so as to facilitate the inspection work. It is said that the measures will be drafted soon and can be implemented within a week.</p>

<h3>Price Limits on Rice, Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains Social Affairs Bureau Urges Compliance</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday convened the responsible persons of the city's North and South Rice Markets, Rice Industry Association, Miscellaneous Grain Market, Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, Oil Market, Oil Pressing Industry Association, and Oil Business Association for a meeting. Section Chief Ji instructed rice, oil, and miscellaneous grain merchants to strictly abide by the government's regulations and sell according to the 8/19 price limits, and not to exceed them. As for the warehouse receipts for edible oil that were previously allowed to be stored, they must be cleared within one week to prevent hoarding and speculation. The prices of rice have been preliminarily approved, and the prices of miscellaneous grains are more complicated and have not yet been determined. The Social Affairs Bureau previously convened flour merchants to talk and urged them to strictly abide by the price limits. However, according to flour merchants, if the price is based on the 8/19 price, the factory price is higher than the wholesale price, and the wholesale price is equal to the retail price. This price is difficult to maintain for a long time. The Social Affairs Bureau will ask the Economic Supervisor for instructions on this and then make a decision. After the prices of rice, flour, miscellaneous grains, and edible oil are reviewed together, they will be submitted to the municipal government for approval and announcement.</p>

<h3>Zhuzhen Boundary Demarcation Issue: Zhuzhen Residents Still Oppose Partition</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The dispute over the boundary demarcation between Zhuzhen and Shanghai municipality has lasted for more than a year. The residents of the area are firmly demanding that the entire town be incorporated into Shanghai. They have repeatedly launched petitions, arguing their case rationally. However, the central government recently announced that half of Zhuzhen will still be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. Upon hearing the news, residents were deeply disappointed, believing that this would lead to discrepancies in political facilities and hinder various constructions such as economic and educational development. Especially during the period of suppressing the rebellion, local security is a concern and will become a hidden danger in the urban area. Moreover, dividing a town into three parts is fragmented and unreasonable. The residents of the entire town are determined to continue their opposition and are unwilling to be divided at all costs. It is reported that local construction promotion associations and other social groups in the town will launch petitions again, requesting the central government to withdraw its decision and make reasonable arrangements.</p>
<h3>Third Anniversary of Victory: Celebrations to be Held Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Suppression and Reconstruction Propaganda Team to Expand Propaganda Efforts Starting Tomorrow</h3>

To celebrate the third anniversary of victory, support the government's currency reform, and eliminate bandits, it has been specifically decided that, starting tomorrow, 200 members of the political work brigade will be dispatched for a week to form 20 propaganda teams to go to suburban areas, Pudong, Longhua, Dachang, Wusong, Jiangwan, Xinshi, Beixinjing, Caohejing, and other places to carry out train-style costumed propaganda, as well as oral propaganda in theaters, dance halls, cafes, tea gardens, and other public places in the city.

<h3>China Textile Corporation's Assets Total $300 Million USD, Inventory Taken to Capital for Government Reference</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The news that the assets of China Textile Construction Corporation are to be converted into marketable securities and stocks will be issued in mid-month has already been reported in this newspaper yesterday. It is now learned that the company's assets were estimated at more than 145 million US dollars at that time, which only included machinery and real estate. Raw materials, finished products, public dormitories, and assets of the Northeast Branch were not included. The unincluded assets are estimated at around 150 million US dollars, so the total assets are around 300 million US dollars. The company has decided to list the unestimated assets separately and will have the company's chief engineer, Ouyang Lun, take them to the capital again today for government reference. In addition, the company is currently designing and rushing to print the issued stocks to be able to release them onto the market in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>Price Limits Announced, Vegetable Market Calm</h3>
<p>Producer Pig Prices Have Risen, Merchants Fearing Supply Exhaustion</p>
<p>[Our Report] The price limits for various meat and vegetable dishes, after being approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, were jointly announced yesterday by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau. The two bureaus sent personnel to inspect various vegetable markets yesterday, and the situation was generally good. Pork and other daily vegetables were sold in accordance with the prescribed prices. However, there are still problems with the supply of pork. Due to the strict requirement to follow the price of August 19, there is a risk of supply exhaustion. According to pork merchants, the wholesale price of pork is 4.8 jinyuan per jin, which is based on the price of August 19. However, the price of August 19 was based on the price of August 11 and 12 in the northern Jiangsu production area. Since then, the price of pork in the northern Jiangsu production area has risen, and the pacification tax has increased by 80%. Therefore, if the current price is followed, the source of supply may be affected. At the same time, Nanjing, because it is closer to the production area, the pigs sold on August 19 were transported from the production area to Nanjing on August 14 and 15. Therefore, the price of pork in Nanjing on August 19 was based on the price of August 14 and 15 in the production area, which was higher than that in Shanghai. The wholesale price of pork in Nanjing on August 19 was 5.4 jia per jin. The Social Affairs Bureau has submitted the above situation to the Economic Supervision Officer's Office for review.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Citizen Visits Mayor, Donates Gold Bars as Special Contribution</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, an anonymous citizen visited the mayor at the municipal government and generously donated two gold bars as a special contribution for relief efforts. Mayor Wu has handed them over to the Shanghai District Solicitation Committee to be exchanged for jinyuan and has sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>Supply Bureau's New Retail Store Overcrowded, "Scalpers" Break Twelve Pieces of Glass in Rush to Buy</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The retail store of the Materials Supply Bureau opened yesterday on the ground floor of the Wing On Company's new building. Because the prices of general daily necessities were lower than those on the market, it became a target for scalpers. Starting at six in the morning, scalpers gathered at the entrance of Seven Heavens. Afterwards, more and more people arrived. By the time the retail store opened at around ten o'clock, nearly a thousand people had gathered outside, among whom were ordinary citizens, but the large-scale scalper contingent was clearly visible. When the iron gate opened, the crowd rushed in, and the retail store was instantly filled to the brim. Canned food, cosmetics, fabrics, and other items with particularly cheap prices were swept away. Although the Materials Supply Bureau stipulates that each person is limited to two items of each kind, scalpers adopted a cooperative method: one person buys the items and hands them to another person, who then repeatedly buys them a second and third time. They were particularly interested in canned peanuts, because the selling price was 300,000 per can, while the market price was 500,000. With one turn, each can could make a profit of 200,000. Therefore, most of them carried more than a dozen cans in their hands when they left. When the crowd squeezed to buy, the noise was chaotic, and the order was disordered. Twelve pieces of glass on the counter were broken, and transactions reached a point where they could not proceed. At this time, there were still as many customers rushing in on the road as there were villagers crossing the river, so they urgently called the police bureau to temporarily send more than 50 police officers in a police vehicle to the scene to maintain order and pulled down the iron gate, allowing only people to exit and not enter. At around eleven o'clock, the retail store decided to close and temporarily suspend business, and a sign was hung high at the door: "Various goods need to be urgently sorted. Please come early tomorrow to purchase goods." The surging crowd gradually dispersed. The method of selling today will be improved after discussion. In addition to strengthening guards to maintain order, customers will be allowed to enter in batches. For peanuts and other particularly cheap items, purchases must be made by queuing up in order from the other door. At the same time, the quantity of various items carried out by customers will be checked to prevent scalpers from buying up the goods. However, the fundamental reason for the rush to buy is that the selling price is lower than that on the market, so the Materials Supply Bureau may consider raising it.</p>
<h3>Journalists Celebrate Journalism Day by Holding Third General Meeting, Designating Annual Journalism Day as a Holiday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Reporters Association held a celebration of Journalism Day and its third general membership meeting yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce auditorium.

<h3>Forgetting Gratitude and Having an Affair with a Friend's Wife, Both Parties Suffered Knife Wounds</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shi Shaoji, a guard at the Fandeng Garden on South Shaanxi Road, introduced his friend Qian Bingjin to work as a head cook at the residence of a Westerner at 244 Yangjia Building, Hongqiao Road, last year. Unexpectedly, Qian and Shi's wife, Yao Xiuling (who was the "amah" at the Westerner's house), developed a relationship after working together for a long time. Later, Qian's wife, Suo Mou, told Shi Shaoji the truth. Shi was extremely angry and went to the Westerner's house at around 5:00 PM yesterday to reason with Qian, accusing him of being inhumane.

According to the company, the results are surprisingly satisfactory. "The Good Earth" is a famous novel by Pearl S. Buck, starring Paul Muni and Luise Rainer.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Districts Officially Established in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

Committee members Ni Bi, Qing Shen'an, and Yu Peihou also arrived at the office to begin handling official business and exercising their powers.

Therefore, the three committee members will take turns to conduct inspections, and all cases will be handled through a joint deliberation system. No ceremony was held when the office was established yesterday. Only Yang Hu, Tao Baichuan, and other former members of the Supervisory Committee who remained in Shanghai were invited to exchange opinions.

<h3>Tragedy at Hongkou Shooting Range: Abandoned Shell Explosion Kills and Injures Eight, Including Four Jinan University Students</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at around 12:40 PM, a tragic incident occurred near the old site of the Hongkou Park shooting range at the end of North Sichuan Road, where an abandoned artillery shell exploded, killing and injuring eight people. The Naval Headquarters Shanghai Factory had taken possession of 3,531 abandoned 15mm mortar shells left by the Japanese army after the war, and these were stored at the old shooting range site. Recently, the factory, seeking to utilize waste materials, entered into a contract with the Zhu Shi Dade Hing Dye Factory, under which the dye factory would extract the explosives from these abandoned shells, the scrap iron would be used for other purposes by the Navy Shanghai Factory, and the explosives would belong to the Dade Hing Factory, with the picric acid component being used to manufacture dyes. Starting from August 16, the factory set up a boiler at the storage site to heat the shells with steam, having already processed 195 shells. Yesterday, another 76 shells were being processed. Before the incident, the old steward of the factory, Bai Fanglong, who was responsible for guarding the boiler, left for lunch and handed over the watch to a young worker named Jin Rentai. Not long after, the boiler and the shells exploded simultaneously with a loud noise. The cause may have been due to the young worker's negligence, causing the boiler temperature to exceed 200 degrees. During the explosion, shell fragments flew in all directions, killing Jin Rentai and another worker on the spot, and injuring four students from Jinan University and two passersby. The dead were later buried, and the injured were sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment. Tang Xingcun, the manager of Dade Hing Dye Factory, has been taken to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Xu Jizhuang's Extradition Nears, Final Trial Scheduled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hong Kong Central Court has investigated the Xu Jizhuang corruption case several times, but no decision has yet been reached on the issue of Xu's extradition. Xian Bingxi, the lawyer representing our country in Hong Kong, telegraphed to Chief Judge Cha of the Shanghai District Court, reporting that the Hong Kong Central Court is scheduled to conduct the final trial of the Xu case on the 21st, 22nd, and 27th of this month. Although the hearing dates are relatively long, according to British and American law, the defendant must be given ample opportunity to defend himself. The Hong Kong side now recognizes that Xu has committed acts of corruption, which is quite beneficial to our request for extradition. If Xu fails to provide sufficient reasons for his defense in this final trial, there should be no problem with our country's extradition request. The telegram also stated that the Hong Kong government has approved our District Court's request, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to send a copy of the Xu case investigation record to Shanghai in the coming days for reference.

<h3>Japanese War Criminal Matsutani, Who Committed Many Evils in Fengjing During the War, Was Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Before Execution, He Took a Bath, Wrote a Will, and Cut His Hair and Nails to Send to His Relatives</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Japanese war criminal Matsutani Yoshimori, 30 years old, from Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, served as a sergeant staff member in the Japanese Army Hangzhou Songjiang Dispatch Unit during the war. Stationed in Guanjing Town, he also served as a guidance officer for the puppet organization, specializing in extorting grain from the jurisdiction, killing civilians, and disturbing the local people. On the 11th day of the second lunar month of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Xu Alai, a resident of Qianda Popu Village, was carrying five dou of grain from a neighboring village, shouldering it to return home, when he encountered Matsutani, who was going to the countryside to extort grain. Matsutani falsely accused Xu of being a rice dealer, severely beat him, and detained him at the Fengjing puppet police station. Two months later, Xu was taken to an open space south of the Catholic Church in the suburbs of Fengjing Town, where Matsutani stabbed him nine times in the back and abdomen with a military sword, followed by beheading. On March 20 of the same year, Matsutani led plainclothes soldiers to the home of Mei Xingsong in Jiangjiabang, claiming to be searching for underground workers. He set fire to the 18 rooms of Jiang's house and used weapons to prevent anyone from helping to extinguish the fire. On the morning of April 11 of the same year, Matsutani led more than ten plainclothes Japanese soldiers to the home of Zhang Xingming in Huangnibang, Yixiang, intending to extort grain. Zhang Xingming saw them coming from afar and, knowing they were up to no good, immediately locked the gate and hid outside to observe the situation. When Matsutani and his men arrived, they broke into the house after seeing the gate locked. Moments later, flames suddenly burst through the roof, and within three hours, the entire house was reduced to ashes. On the same day, Matsutani went to the home of Wang Yueqi, the deputy chief of Jiexu Township, and extorted more than ten dan of food rice. He then went to the home of Wang Zhou and extorted more than twenty dan of food rice, without paying any price or issuing any receipts. In April of the same year, Matsutani went to Tangnipo, Yangziwei, Fenglin Township, and attempted to extort grain but failed. He then set fire to all the houses in the village, with only three families spared. After the victory, local citizens, including Ling Jingxing, reported and detained him. Shi Meiyu, the presiding judge of the War Criminals Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense, conducted a thorough trial. Based on conclusive evidence, he sentenced Matsutani to death and submitted the verdict to President Chiang for approval, ordering its execution. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Prosecutor Shi Yong, accompanied by Clerk Guo Zhenji, Interpreter Wang Renming, and a squad of armed military police, went to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison and brought Matsutani out of prison. Knowing that his end was near, Matsutani requested permission to take a bath and change his clothes. He then put on his military uniform, long leather boots, and a white collared shirt, and went out with them. He was tall and handsome, wearing tortoise-shell rimmed glasses and had well-groomed hair. The public trial was temporarily set up in the First Tribunal of the Special Criminal Court. After the court opened and the prosecutor announced the execution, Matsutani immediately requested to write three wills: one to bid farewell to his family, one to the 300 inmates in Jiangwan, and another to his beloved subordinate, Kutsuchi Kuniji. After writing, he cut off a small amount of his nails and hair in court, along with a pen, and placed them in an envelope, writing that they should be handed over to Gangcun Ningji to be forwarded to his relatives in Japan. At this point, the prosecutor announced the adjournment of the court, and Matsutani was escorted to the execution ground. Matsutani was still singing loudly when the shot rang out and he fell into a pool of blood. The time was precisely 12:45 PM. The body of the condemned was immediately buried.

<h3>Record of the Re-Laying and Opening of the Jiangnan Railway's Nanjing-Wuhu Section</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper, Kang Feng</p>
<p>[Quick Report from Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 30th] Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, a retired revolutionary elder who is engaged in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, has never forgotten the re-laying and opening of the Jiangnan Railway, which he sponsored. At the beginning of July, the steel rails and accessories purchased by the Jiangnan Railway Company in the United States arrived in Shanghai, followed immediately by the arrival of the sleepers purchased in Canada. Zhou Jinsong, the acting general manager of the company, also flew from the United States to Shanghai. In order to accelerate the establishment of Jiangnan's overall war preparedness, the company decided to open the Nanjing-Wuhu section to traffic within 50 days.</p>
<p>On July 12, track laying began at the Zhonghuamen Station in Nanjing. Prior to this, the Ministry of Transportation had ordered the two railway bureaus to prioritize the transport of the "Jiangnan" steel rails and sleepers to Nanjing. The Ministry of Transportation provided assistance in many other matters as well. On July 12, the 75-pound steel rails were laid one by one on the roadbed of the Nanjing-Wuhu section, from which the steel rails had been removed two and a half years ago. The fishplates were installed, the bolts were tightened, the first group of track-laying workers moved forward, and the second group of track-lifting workers came to place the sleepers under the laid steel rails and nail them in place with spikes.</p>
<p>Two Kilometers a Day</p>
<p>In this way, two kilometers a day, the track-laying team, under the direction of a construction train made up of three freight cars, came from Nanjing to Wuhu. They passed Jiangning Town, Tongjing, Cihu, and entered the territory of Dangtu County in Anhui Province, passing through Caishi, Ma'anshan, Dangtu, and Daqiao, finally arriving at the Wuhu riverside station on August 27. The time was exactly within 50 days.</p>
<p>During the 45 days of intense work, the employees of the track-laying team, from the chief engineer Wang Yuchen, the team leader, to the workers who used the adze and iron hammer to lift the rails and drive in the spikes, were all tanned black. Fortunately, the route was flat, it was a re-laid old base, and the bridge engineering had been completed early, so the track-laying progressed smoothly. A dozen or so people who had their skin and bones broken by sleepers, steel rails, and crushed stones were immediately bandaged by Dr. Yin, who accompanied the train, with bone-setting medicine.</p>
<p>In the short 90 kilometers of the Nanjing-Wuhu section of the main line and the 10 kilometers of the side line, 1,540 sleepers were used per kilometer, for a total of more than 150,000 sleepers. 7,300 tons of 75-pound steel rails purchased in the United States were used. Because this was not enough, 700 tons of 60-pound steel rails that were previously stored on the route were also collected, and a total of 9,000 tons of steel products, such as fast fishplates and spikes, were laid. Other tasks, such as the erection of telephone lines along the line, the installation of electric lights at the Nanjing and Wuhu stations, the repair of station buildings, and the renovation of platforms, were all underway. In order to strengthen the roadbed, stones were quarried at Tongjing Station to fill in the thinner sections of the roadbed.</p>
<p>Less Than 700 People</p>
<p>These projects, under the personal direction of Zhou Xianjun and the leadership of Wang Yuchen, were completed by fewer than 700 people, including more than 40 management employees, 300 track-laying workers, 150 track-lifting and sleeper-laying workers, and more than 160 workers in Nanjing Zhonghuamen who loaded materials onto the train and supplied them forward! In 45 days, the work of re-laying 100 kilometers of the main and side lines was completed! On August 27, the workers' shed arrived at the Wuhu riverside station. The workers were sorting out the last section in the dim light of the waning moon. The green tents stretched out like military camps. In the second half of the night, they lay down to sleep inside, their tired bodies exhausted. In the summer night, the fragrance of fireflies and rice paddies blew in the night wind, caressing their dark, oily bodies. Although it was not the vitamin-rich fragrance that directly nourished them, it was also a silent welcoming gift from the countryside of Jiangnan in August's autumn harvest to the laborers from the city!</p>
<p>Everything has to be done quickly, this is the modern entrepreneurial spirit! At 8:00 AM and 4:30 PM on August 28, a passenger car of no particular class departed from Wuhu and Nanjing, respectively. On this day, travelers traveling on the Nanjing-Wuhu line exchanged a low price of 1.5 yuan for a smooth train journey. They no longer had to worry about breaking down, nor did they have to worry that their lives would be thrown into the underworld due to an occasional oversight by the driver. The travelers smelled the fragrance of the autumn harvest rice paddies in Jiangnan and watched the picturesque harvest scenes, with white geese and yellow chickens nimbly pecking in the ponds and fields, as if they had returned to the quiet life before the war.</p>
<p>Wang Yuzan, the head of the Transportation Section, said that their transportation forecast for these two months, September and October, is to supply 3,000 to 4,000 passengers per day. After two months, when everything is normal, they hope to increase the ticket sales volume to 5,000 passengers per day (i.e., supplying 1.8 million travelers per year). In terms of freight transport, the expected outbound goods are agricultural products such as rice, rapeseed, and goose and duck feathers, at approximately 300 tons per day, with an annual transport volume of 110,000 tons. The inbound goods are Huainan coal for the Wuhu Electric Light Company and Huai salt, general merchandise, cloth, cotton yarn, etc., at approximately 100 tons per day, or 3,000 tons per month. Currently, they are negotiating with the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on matters related to joint transportation for both passenger and freight transport. The Yao Huamen Station of the two railway bureaus before the war had a joint transportation line connecting to the Zhonghuamen Station of the Jiangnan Railway. Now that the re-laying is complete, the agricultural products of southern Anhui can be loaded in Wuhu and transported directly to Shanghai. Industrial products for domestic sales from Shanghai also do not need to be unloaded in Nanjing before arriving in Wuhu.</p>
<p>It's Just the Beginning</p>
<p>These completed and soon-to-be-completed projects are just the beginning. Currently, the tracks have been re-laid, and there are 12 locomotives that can be used for traffic, 19 newly purchased American-made steel-skinned passenger cars, 7 freight cars converted into third-class cars, 6 old passenger cars newly refitted, and freight cars can be supplied without shortage after freight transport is launched. Zhou Xiansong, the acting general manager, talked about the founder of this railway, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang. Although he is nearly completely blind, the old gentleman sees that China is bright, and many emerging industries will replace the tragic situation of bloody battles. This old gentleman wants his business to benefit the people's livelihood and the national economy, and he wants his business to create batches of young people who can renew feudal China. Even if his eyes cannot see the light, his heart has a bright view in sight!</p>
<p>The Third Good News</p>
<p>During the war, this railway had already been opened to traffic to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng, and the track laying had passed through the mountainous area of Huizhou in southern Anhui and reached Jingdezhen, the porcelain capital of Jiangxi, and was about to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at Yingtan Station. The Anti-Japanese War dismantled the repaired Huizhou area railway, and the Nanjing-Wuhu-Xuancheng section fell into enemy hands. Less than three months after the victory, this 60-pound light rail was dismantled for the needs of other railways, leaving the Nanjing-Wuhu section reliant on small ferries and bumpy trucks for connection. Now, with the autumn harvest and the advent of the gold yuan as the first two pieces of good news, the re-laying of the Jiangnan Railway to Wuhu is truly the third piece of good news for travelers!</p>
<h3>Surveying Jiaozuo, the Coal Capital, from a New Perspective (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Quick Report from Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo, 28th] In the afternoon of that day, Director Li accompanied me down the mine. I put on the blue cloth worker's uniform, wore the "wicker hat" woven from rattan, and took a cane and flashlight, and went down 500 feet deep into the ground.</p>
<p>This is the world of coal, the dim electric lights emitting light with uncertain strength. We walked along the main passageway, heading southwest. Coal cars slid along the tracks, passing by our side. The height and width of the passageway were standard: nine feet high and eleven feet wide. But some places were very low, so you had to lower your head to pass. Sometimes, because I was preoccupied with talking, I didn't pay attention, so I bumped my head more than ten times. The layout of this mine uses the room and pillar method. A coal pillar is left every 100 meters square. Along both sides of the passageway, every 100 meters, tunnels are drilled to the left and right for mining. The passageway is supported by wooden pillars, one on each side and one above. The distance between them depends on the quality of the coal and the top pressure, averaging about 40 centimeters. Wooden pillars are the soul of the entire mine. Without them, production is impossible, and if the calculation is inaccurate or there is slight negligence during the pillar support, it affects the lives of thousands of miners. Currently, the need for wooden pillars is also one of the most difficult problems for the mine. According to general calculations, six wooden segments (i.e., two sets) are needed for every ten tons of coal produced, and the trees near Jiaozuo were cut down long ago due to wartime military and railway needs. Recently, the mine has purchased them at high prices, stipulating that five wooden segments can be exchanged for one ton of coal, but the source of wooden segments is still limited, so the mine can only dismantle the pillars of less important coal tunnels to meet the current need. The pillars that support the coal seam are commonly known as "sheds" in the mine. It is one of the most closely watched items in mining. There are dedicated people responsible for checking it every day. Because the upper coal seam gradually presses down, the unstable coal seam can easily drop pieces of coal, which may collapse the shed. The reporter saw in several places that there were large gaps above the beams and pillars, which were filled with wooden segments. This is the kind of work they do.</p>
<p>The main passageway of Wangfeng Mine runs about 400 feet northeast and about 4,000 feet southwest. We walked about 1,700 feet southwest along the slope of the coal seam, at an inclination of about 10 degrees, and then turned southwest again, at an inclination angle of 15 degrees, to the mining area. There are very few electric lights in this section. Coal workers live in coal piles all year round. They cannot see the sunlight, but they bring infinite light and heat to people underground.</p>
<p>Because the traffic is suffocated, limiting the production of coal, no new tunnels are being opened in the mine now. Only</p>
<p>Old Tunnels Are Being Mined</p>
<p>is enough to meet the current need. The main tools for mining are iron drills and explosives. After the coal is blasted down, it is pushed from the rails to the pit mouth in "yuanbao cars" that transport coal, and then hoisted by a winding machine to the coal plant. In places with particularly steep slopes, the coal cars are towed by electric winches.</p>
<p>The treatment of water leaking into the mine from the cracks in the rock layer is also an important task in mining. The day I went down the mine, it rained heavily overnight, so there was particularly a lot of water in the mine. When I went down the mine, the sound of dripping water from the four walls was like heavy rain. The water accumulated on both sides of the railway tracks in the mine was several inches deep, flowing towards the water pool in the original room. The electric motor in the original room was working non-stop, and it could pump away five tons of accumulated water per minute, so there was no problem in dealing with some accumulated water.</p>
<p>After staying in the mine for 50 minutes, I also returned to the ground with a face full of coal. Near the mine there is also an electric sorting machine, which is not used now because of the low output. In order to save expenses, the coal sorting work is not done by workers, but by Director Li Fazong leading all the employees to do agricultural labor. A light rail track is laid under the coal sorting machine, which is connected to the Xin-Jiao Railway. It is very convenient to transport coal in normal times. After the Xin-Jiao line was cut off, the branch line for transporting coal has also been idle until now. The rails are rusty, and piles of green grass grow between the sleepers.</p>
<p>Currently, the Jiaozuo Mine produces 100 to 200 tons of coal per day. Part of it is consumed by the mine itself, turning into power, and part of it is used to meet external needs. In Jiaozuo, various institutions, water, electricity, and coal, must be supplied by Zhongfu Company unconditionally. This consumption requires more than 4,000 tons of coal per month. The remaining dozens to hundreds of tons are only used to supply retailers, who transport them to Xinxiang for sale by trucks or human power.</p>

<h3>After the Implementation of Export Price Limits, the International Market for Tung Oil Improved; Various Trading Firms Have Been Purchasing Heavily in Hankou Recently</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources from the Export Control Commission, the export of tung oil from our country in the past few weeks has been declining due to the competitive sales of exporters and the price suppression of foreign importers. The New York market price has fallen to as low as 18 cents per pound. After the currency system reform, the relevant authorities implemented export price limit measures to prevent merchants from competing to sell at low prices and causing a continued decline in overseas prices. It is now known that the New York market price of tung oil has risen to over 20 cents per pound.</p>
<p>Another report: The domestic sales season for tung oil has passed, and the market has been extremely sluggish recently. The prospects for foreign sales are now optimistic. It is heard that since the currency system reform, various export firms stationed in Hankou have been absorbing large quantities. In the past few days, 5,000 to 6,000 dan have been traded daily, and the estimated total has been no less than 30,000 dan. The current oil price in Hankou is 68.8 yuan per dan, plus exchange fees and transportation costs, the cost to Shanghai is about 76 yuan. The oil price in Hangzhou is 73.5 yuan, plus transportation costs to Shanghai and loss and consumption, which is similar to the price in Hankou. If calculated based on the export price limit of 20 cents C.R.F. per pound and 18 cents F.O.B., a large export volume can be expected.</p>
<h3>North and South City Counterfeit Education Intermingling; Rice Price Fluctuations Minimal</h3>
<p>Flour Trading Temporarily Suspended; Oil Market Stable</p>
<p>In yesterday's rice market, the northern city (北市) was slightly firmer while the southern city (南市) was somewhat weaker, reversing the previous day's situation. In the northern city, due to lower prices the day before, rice shops went there to purchase, leading to brisk sales and price increases. Superior white japonica and high-quality thin indica rice rose slightly by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, while mid-grade and lower-quality rice increased by 0.40 to 0.50 yuan. Sales of new japonica rice were sluggish, with only mid-grade and lower-quality rice rising by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. The market in the southern city started similarly to the previous day, but shops bought less, resulting in sluggish sales, and prices fell slightly by closing. Thick and thin indica rice both declined by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, while white yuan rice remained stable. Yesterday, a total of 3,178 shi (石) of rice arrived in the northern and southern cities combined.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Due to restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Social Affairs on old warehouse receipts (老棧單), trading has been suspended from today. Deliveries are limited to within seven days, but industry members felt the deadline was too short to meet. Yesterday, a special extraordinary general meeting was convened, resolving to request an extension of the deadline. Meanwhile, members were asked to first register their warehouse receipts. As a result, no trading took place. Reportedly, the asking price for "warship flour" (兵船粉) dropped to 6.50 yuan, while large bags of wheat bran opened at 5.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Trading was generally conducted at the limited prices, but due to scarce supply, transactions were even more quiet. The price of soybeans from the production area was high, and most owners were reluctant to sell, resulting in few transactions. Only some broad beans (荼豆) were sold in the local market, with prices following the limited range. Broad bean prices did not fluctuate, and there was no supply of selected green beans. Corn from the Yantai region was being collected, with prices similar to the previous day, and trading was still active. Yuan wheat saw few transactions, with average sales and stable prices. Only some sesame was sold in the local market, with transactions at limited prices. Restrictions were imposed on the re-export of shelled peanuts (生仁), so Guang-based merchants (廣帮) did not purchase, resulting in no trading and stable prices.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Warehouse receipt goods, bean and rapeseed oil were stable to weak. With the impending ban on warehouse receipt trading, holders were very willing to sell, continuing to offer their goods. Bean and rapeseed oil were initially firm but weakened later, resulting in prices similar to the previous day, showing a stable to weak trend. Raw oil (生油) was firm, with refined raw oil (凈生油) pegged at the limited price, and few offers being made. There was no supply of small cart sesame oil (小車蔴油), resulting in no trading. The bean cake market was firm and rising, with all brands pegged at the limited price.</p>
<h3>Money Market Remains Very Loose; Slight Clearing Differences Among Banks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money market in this city remained very loose. The four banks (四行), two bureaus (二局), and one treasury (一庫) experienced slight clearing differences in bills and notes among the silver and money businesses, totaling 1.8 million yuan. The Central Bank (中央銀行) had a clearing outflow of 1.53 million yuan, the Bank of China (中國銀行) had a clearing inflow of 1.66 million yuan, the Bank of Communications (交通銀行) had a clearing inflow of 0.28 million yuan, the Farmers Bank of China (農民銀行) had a clearing outflow of 0.17 million yuan, the Central Trust of China (中信局) had a clearing inflow of 0.03 million yuan, the Postal Savings System (郵政局) had a clearing inflow of 0.04 million yuan, and the Central Cooperative Treasury (中央合作金庫) had a clearing outflow of 0.13 million yuan. Commercial banks and firms (商業行莊) had a clearing outflow of 1.08 million yuan in large clearings and 0.44 million yuan in small clearings. Foreign banks (外商銀行) had a total clearing inflow of 0.46 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Internal Exchange Rates of National Banks to be Lowered Again Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Starting tomorrow, the internal exchange rates of national banks such as the Central Bank to Fuzhou and other places will be lowered again as follows: Fuzhou 40 yuan per 1,000 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Guangzhou 20 yuan (originally 25 yuan), Shantou 25 yuan (originally 30 yuan), Changsha 35 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Hengyang and Yuanling 40 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Hankou 30 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Chongqing and Chengdu 35 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Wanxian and Ziliujing 40 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Qingdao 20 yuan (originally 10 yuan), Yantai 25 yuan (originally 10 yuan), Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Ji'an 35 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Hangzhou 3 yuan (originally 5 yuan), Ningbo 5 yuan (originally 8 yuan), Hefei and Wuhu 20 yuan (originally 40 yuan), Bengbu 25 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang 40 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Guiyang 40 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Kunming 35 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Xining, Ningxia, Kangding, Xichang, Guihua, Dihua, and Hami 20 yuan (originally 30 yuan).</p>
<h3>National Banks Sell Special Grade Refined White Sugar</h3>
<p>In view of the strong actual sales of sugar near the holidays, and to prevent price fluctuations, national banks recently resolved to entrust Taiwan Sugar Corporation (台糖公司) to sell a batch of 200-catty packaged special grade refined white sugar, starting today (2nd). Customers approved for registration by the company can go to the company between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM on the same day to participate in the lowest price bidding, it is said.</p>
<h3>Illegal Use of Loan Funds</h3>
<p>Lending Banks Should Bear Joint and Several Liability</p>
<p>The Provisional Rules for Interbank Rediscounting and Reloaning by the Central Bank have been approved by the Joint Board of Four Banks (四聯總處). According to a Central Bank official, the main purpose of these Provisional Rules is to support the government's emergency handling of financial and economic matters, improve interbank lending operations, control interest rates, support production, and encourage the circulation of daily necessities and export goods. The total amount of loans for which banks apply for rediscounting, relicensing, or export financing should not exceed the paid-up capital and the average total deposit amount of the previous month. The loan targets are also stricter than in the past, and the original loan interest rate is limited to no more than 3% per month. Rediscounting and relicensing may be handled at 60% to 80% of the original loan interest rate, and the discount for rediscounting and relicensing is 70% to 90% of the original loan amount. If it is found that loan manufacturers are using funds for non-productive purposes or hoarding for speculation, the lending bank shall bear joint and several liability. The above are the important meanings of this revision of the interbank rediscounting rules.</p>
<h3>National Banks Must Also Deposit 100% Reserves for Developing Bank Notes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] It is reported that the six national banks in this city, including the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, previously applied for exemption from the restriction that the outstanding balance of bank notes on the same day must have 100% reserves deposited with the Central Bank or the clearing house when issuing bank notes. This matter was referred by the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau to the Ministry of Finance, which instructed that no exceptions should be made. The Bureau has now ordered all relevant banks to comply.</p>
<h3>Interest on Deposit Reserves Reduced to 2% Per Month</h3>
<p>The Central Bank continues to handle bank deposit reserves in accordance with the Banking Law, charging 15% for current deposits and 10% for fixed deposits. The interest rate has been reduced to 2% per month.</p>
<p>The National Bank Inspection Office (國行稽該處) recently issued a comparative table of the total amount of deposits and reserves of banks nationwide in August, as follows: current deposits 23,187,339,795,771.10 yuan, fixed deposits 4,339,825,484,929.62 yuan, total deposits 27,527,165,280,690.92 yuan, paid reserves 31,815,448,931,823.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Conditions Turn Firmer</h3>
<p>Timber market conditions remain stable and uneventful, but market sentiment is firmer than before. For example, top-grade fir wood strips (杉木條子) are not being sold at 0.12 yuan, and only lower-grade goods are still available on the market. It is reported that the production cost of fir wood in Fujian is still high. The cost of special fir wood strips delivered to Shanghai is 0.17 yuan, while the selling price in Shanghai is only 0.14 to 0.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Trading Becomes Active; Cloth Trading Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the cotton yarn market became active. Due to the loose money supply in the market, although the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) opened sales, replicating merchants and visiting merchants (客帮) had an appetite for goods. Market prices were all traded at the limited price. The association is currently requesting the authorities to inform the Textile Construction Company and private yarn factories to increase supply and adjust legal profits. Market sentiment has therefore eased. Yesterday, 22 types of coarse and fine yarn were traded, totaling 43.5 pieces. Also reported: The Textile Construction Company continued to open sales of four types of coarse yarn. 10-count Fugui (富貴) was priced at 490 yuan, 16-count Three Sheep (三羊) was priced at 585 yuan, and 20-count Golden Double Chicken Running (金雙鷄·奔騰) was priced at 645 yuan each. Each household was limited to purchasing one piece, so applications were very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market remains stagnant. Most market prices have reached the price increase limit, and trading has automatically suspended. However, a few brokers are trying to find low-grade assorted fine cloth, but ultimately there are no sellers, so no transactions can be made. Occasionally, due to actual needs, people are willing to exchange Four Gentlemen Yuan Beaverteen (四君子元嗶嘰) plus one yuan for Dragon Head Fine Cloth (龍頭細布).</p>
<p>Also reported, the various cloths supplied for sale by the Textile Construction Company two days ago were mostly drawn by lot. For example, Yanghe B-character Fine Cloth (陽鶴Ｂ字細布), Jumping Carp Navy Beaverteen (跳鯉藏靑嗶嘰), Playing Umbrella Bleached Cloth (玩傘漂布), and Da Ling Special Lotus Girl (大另特荷花女), etc. Each household could receive one piece of each type, so the market supply was insufficient. Also reported: Cloth wholesalers such as Xinda Xiang and Bao Da Xiang are selling Dragon Head Fine Cloth at 29.5 yuan and Four Gentlemen Yuan Beaverteen at 28.5 yuan, supplying according to the limit, but must cut open the package to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>Also reported: Zhong Textile (中紡) customarily sold 13 types of yarn, totaling 1,420 pieces, with a total value of 1,347,103 yuan. Starting September 3rd, China Textile's cotton yarn registration (for replicating factories) will change to 9:30 AM, with purchase applications closing at 10:30 AM. Also, starting September 2nd, cotton cloth will be listed earlier at 10:00 AM, with orders closing at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Council for Issuance Regularly Announces the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserves and Figures</h3>
<p>For this currency reform, the reserves for issuing Gold Yuan (金圓券) notes are extremely sufficient. In order to show great credibility to the people, the government has established an Issuance Supervisory Council, responsible for supervision and inspection. The Council has been formally established and has begun to perform its duties. The Council has already dispatched personnel to inspect and verify the cash reserve of US$200 million and the guarantee reserve of US$300 million. The cash reserve includes gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The guarantee reserve is the assets of state-owned enterprises, and detailed lists have been prepared separately. The Council's inspection work is carried out by members rotating each month, with Committee Member Xu Jiqing (徐委員寄廎) for August. Committee Member Xu has already inspected and verified the preparatory matters for the August inspection and the issuance figures before August 31st, and will hold a committee meeting this Saturday (4th) to report the inspection situation and the government's issuance figures to the conference, and formally announce them to the people. Also, regarding the guarantee reserve, the government is actively selling state-owned enterprises and is simultaneously organizing companies to issue stocks. 50% of the stocks sold will be used to supplement the guarantee reserve.</p>
<h3>Two Batches of Cotton Yarn Sold to Burma Set Sail</h3>
<p>The Foreign Sales Committee for Textile Products handled 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn to be shipped to Burma. The first batch of 4,000 pieces has already set sail. The second batch of 4,000 pieces has been loaded onto the China Merchants Bureau’s Deng Yu (登禹) ship, bound for Burma. The ship is scheduled to clear customs yesterday, and will set sail as soon as possible. Also, the cotton needed for the 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn cannot be purchased yet, and the Foreign Sales Committee plans to temporarily borrow a portion from the second phase of the American Aid cotton from the American Aid Association for use, and in the future, the foreign exchange earned from the batch of cotton yarn will be used to purchase the same amount of cotton to repay.</p>
<h3>National Banks Temporarily Suspend New Loans</h3>

<p>The Steel, Copper, Tin, and Hardware Associations are still uncertain about the limited prices for the industry. The four industry associations may hold a joint meeting to discuss and agree on them to avoid discrepancies.</p>
<p>The Egg Industry Association believes that egg prices have been affected by the "August 19" price limits in recent days, so formal transactions cannot be carried out, and the agreement between the Association and the Bureau of Social Affairs has not yet been reached. The Industry Association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss everything.</p>
<p>It is reported that members of the Shanghai National Paint and Sundry Goods Commercial Association, who operate commodities such as lithopone, zinc oxide, massicot, red lead, lead powder, and ink ash, have their selling prices set and distributed to each store by the Association. There is no tea party setting in the market, and no brokers are involved. However, the dye industry has tea parties in places like Qinglian Pavilion and Yijia Chun in this city, it is said.</p>

<h3>Dunhuang Art</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>The National Dunhuang Art Research Institute held an exhibition at the Central Research Institute in Nanjing from August 24th to 29th, featuring complete reproductions of the murals from the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang. The exhibits were divided into categories such as photography, selected representative works of murals from various dynasties, patterns of caissons, floral borders, and Buddha halos from various dynasties, lotus pedestals from various dynasties, and historical materials related to customs, including musical performances, landscapes, figures, boats, vehicles, architecture, clothing, animals, and apsaras. There were no fewer than a thousand items on display. In particular, the reproductions of the murals were so accurate in color and shape that they were indistinguishable from the originals, almost making us feel as if we were in the Mogao Grottoes. They were vastly superior to those who only depict a fragment and then boast of novelty.</p>
<p>From the Northern Wei Dynasty to the end of the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang was an international city in northwestern China. Reading Mr. Xiang Da's book "Chang'an and Western Civilization in the Tang Dynasty" will provide detailed information. It has been determined that the Li Tang ethnicity was a foreign tribe from the northwest, but they were already heavily sinicized. However, they did not reject the Hu people (non-Han) as much as previous dynasties. Many of the ministers who made great contributions during the early Tang Dynasty were foreigners (Yuchi Jingde is the most famous, originating from the Northern Wei Dynasty, with his ancestor being from Yuqi in the Western Regions). Therefore, several major cities in China at that time were areas where foreigners gathered, such as Guangzhou and Yangzhou, which were residences for Hu people who came to China by sea, and Luoyang and Chang'an, which were inhabited by Hu people from the West. Dunhuang was the boundary between China and the Western Regions, so many foreigners came to reside there. On one hand, they admired Chinese culture, and on the other hand, they also spread Hu customs to China. Tang Dynasty music, dance, clothing, games, and food were all influenced by Hu customs, similar to how the upper class in our country today values Westernization. The more prominent the officials and nobles, the deeper the Hu influence. We generally believe that the Tang Dynasty was the most prosperous period for Chinese culture and education, but we do not know that foreign culture was on par with China at that time. Now, looking at the foreign princes, foreignized Buddha statues, and various musical performances in the Dunhuang murals, we gain a deeper understanding of the Hu customs of that time. As for the Buddha statues, their composition, clothing, etc., are nothing like the rigid ones of today. The proportions and facial features of the whole body are very similar to the models painted by Western painters today, giving us a sense of humanity rather than absurd superstition. In the beautiful harmony, the supreme perfection is revealed, and the solemn and wonderful appearance mentioned in the scriptures is truly protected.</p>
<p>The paintings of the Wei, Sui, and early Tang dynasties are full of majestic spirit. For example, there are two types of Buddha stories, one called "Bodhisattva Sacrifices Himself to Feed a Hungry Tiger" and the other called "The Story of the Five Hundred Robbers." The former is well known to everyone. The latter tells the story of five hundred robbers who were arrested and subjected to eye gouging. Later, they converted to Buddhism and regained their sight. These two continuous story paintings, with their rough lines and bold composition, everywhere show the characteristics of early folk art, unlike the weak and lifeless paintings drawn by painters or artisans since the Ming and Qing dynasties, which are simply like corpses with their eyes open. This comic strip style should really be used by today's artists. The Chinese nation is too old, and its blood and physique have become stagnant and decayed. It must be infused with new blood cells to be revived. Rather than peddling from Europe and the United States, it is better to seek from our ancestors. I think that the above-mentioned continuous story paintings gradually became petty and powerless after the Song Dynasty. The Buddha's renunciation story painted by the Song people is a small picture, lacking courage and spirit, far inferior to the continuous painting methods of the Sui and Tang dynasties, and the brushstrokes cannot be compared. The Western Xia Buddha paintings contemporaneous with the Song Dynasty seem to be slightly better, and their caisson patterns are no less impressive than those of the Sui and Tang Dynasties, showing how different the spirit of a rising nation is from that of a declining one. This cannot help but make us think of other departments from art.</p>
<p>The art and documents of Dunhuang have become famous in the world due to the exaggeration of foreigners such as Pelliot and Stein. It is a pity that Chinese archaeologists did not realize that there was such a treasure trove in the Western Regions until Pelliot held an exhibition of the treasures he had looted at the Six Nations Hotel in Beijing and boasted about it. But 50 or 60 years ago, Stein had already printed The Thousand Buddhas, and Pelliot had also printed extremely exquisite Dunhuang illustrations. Even the Oriental Culture Research Institute of Japan has printed a "Study of Dunhuang Paintings." The books by Pelliot and Stein are extremely exquisite and more valuable than gold. The Japanese one also has more than 800 pages and more than 400 illustrations, which cannot but make us feel ashamed. Now, trying to use the achievements of the Dunhuang Research Institute as a basis to print a more perfect Dunhuang catalog, not only will it be enough to preserve countless national treasures, but it will also allow artists and archaeologists to increase countless materials. Private power is limited, and the government does not seem to be able to ignore it. Standing in the position of a reader, I am eagerly looking forward to its realization day and night.</p>
<p>Oak Ridge, hidden deep in the mountains of Tennessee, is one of the units of the American atomic bomb factory. It is heavily guarded, with the gate guarded by an armored vehicle controlled by the security police, which is connected to the central security headquarters and every "nerve center" in the isolated areas by wireless telephone.</p>
<p>This is the location of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, part of the nuclear research center. It consists of one hundred and fifty buildings. A small gray house stores the "atomic pile."</p>
<p>The so-called "atomic pile" is a graphite brick containing refined uranium ore. These graphite bricks are accumulated piece by piece, hence the name "atomic pile."</p>
<p>The Oak Ridge atomic pile is dedicated to producing radioactive materials for military, industrial, medical, and other experimental or practical uses. It contains more potential energy than the total energy of all the locomotives in the world, and the radiation emitted is equivalent to one million pounds of radium.</p>
<p>Oak Ridge's products are also shipped to Hanford, Washington, to produce Plutonium, and to Los Alamos to manufacture atomic bombs.</p>
<p>In Oak Ridge, atomic materials are manufactured in two different ways. One of them is undertaken by the "Electromagnetic Factory."</p>
<p>The Electromagnetic Factory is six miles away from the research center (all large units are isolated by mountains to reduce the risk of explosion). It is also known as the Y-12 factory, with a total of one hundred and seventy buildings, costing $400 million to build - more than the cost of opening the Panama Canal. During construction, because the United States was short of copper, it borrowed nearly $500 million worth of silver from the US Treasury to use as conductors. This silver is still there.</p>
<p>This unique factory in the world specializes in separating Uranium 235 from Uranium 238. It has thousands of complex machines, managed by thousands of male and female workers. However, each person manages only a simple small unit and is ignorant of the overall machine.</p>
<p>The hydropower plant here is also unparalleled in the world. Its power generation is twice that of the largest "Norris Dam" in the "Tennessee Valley Authority" (TVA).</p>
<p>On the other side of another mountain is the K-25 factory, which is a sister factory to the "Electromagnetic Factory." However, it does not use the electromagnetic method to manufacture atomic materials, but uses the gaseous distribution method. It has seventy buildings, of which the four-story main building is the largest single factory on Earth. This building is U-shaped, with wings one and a half miles long and 133 yards wide. Adjacent to it is a replica factory, but only a quarter of its size. Both units are filled with extremely precise machinery. Their purpose is to separate Uranium 235 from uranium compounds on a large scale.</p>
<p>In the Daang factory, uranium is first converted into a gas and then into a solid.</p>
<p>True atomic fission is achieved by forcing gas through thousands of incredibly fine screens. Each screen surface has billions of holes smaller than two millionths of a square inch.</p>
<p>The entire mechanism absolutely prevents the leakage of secrets. The detection equipment to prevent leakage is extremely thorough. If this equipment were installed in a large city, the central control room would be alerted if any doorbell rang, an elevator went up and down, a light went on or off, a telephone was used, or a window broke.</p>
<p>Oak Ridge is only one unit of the American atomic bomb factory. The vastness of its engineering and the meticulousness of its organization are already amazing; how complex and huge is the entire atomic bomb factory!</p>

<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>The French poet Baudelaire dyed his hair dark green, boasted of eating human flesh, and lived with snakes all day long.</p>
<p>The American painter Whistler always drew a butterfly when signing his paintings and private letters. He wore a white silk ribbon on his hair every day.</p>
<p>The German philosopher Spinoza often spent many hours capturing spiders and making them fight each other.</p>

<p>Bamboo Branch</p>
<p>Deep in the mountains and dense forests (bamboo branch) the sky is rarely seen (daughter), loves to sing clear songs (bamboo branch) tender eyebrows in the daytime (daughter), used to traveling between Baidi and Jiangling (bamboo branch) (daughter), why bother in life (bamboo branch) to write of long separation (daughter)!</p>
<p>Picking Lotus Seeds</p>
<p>Flowers are more beautiful than clothes, fragrance is stronger, willows are jealous of her eyebrows (lifting the paddle), lotus leaves are everywhere, fish playing east and west (young), looking from afar at the paired stamens on the opposite bank (lifting the paddle), afraid of letting her companions know her heart (young).</p>

<h3>Churchill on Wine</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>In January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill held the historically famous Casablanca Conference.</p>
<p>During the conference, one morning, Roosevelt sent his most trusted staff member, Hopkins, to contact Churchill. Hopkins was slightly surprised when he arrived at Churchill's residence!</p>
<p>It turned out that this great British Prime Minister had not yet gotten up. He was lying in bed in pink pajamas, eating something.</p>
<p>And Churchill's breakfast was a bottle of fine wine!</p>
<p>Hopkins couldn't help but ask Churchill what it meant to drink wine first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Churchill replied that he had always had a strong aversion to milk, but he didn't hate a bottle of good wine. After careful consideration, he decided to drink wine. He said that he was sixty-eight years old and had always been healthy. Throughout his life, he felt that doctors' advice was often unreliable. He said that whether it was light wine or strong wine, he would never quit—now and in the future.</p>
<h3>Pi Cao Studies Monetary Exchange</h3>
<p>Since the banks opened on the 22nd, two days after the government changed the currency on the 20th, the situation in the market can be generally described. People flocked to exchange gold, silver, and US dollars for the new currency, especially those who exchanged silver for new notes, which was the most crowded. Because the private market price of silver has always been much lower than that of silver dollars, this time the regulations suddenly made it higher than silver dollars (one tael of pure silver can be exchanged for three yuan in new notes, while one silver dollar can be exchanged for two yuan, almost the opposite of the ratio before the 20th), so those who hold silver were overjoyed. Although the exchange rate for silver dollars (6 million legal tender) is slightly less than the previous private market rate (between 7 and 8), the national bank's acceptance is not very picky about minor flaws, and many students and family members bought them a few months ago to meet urgent needs, waiting for the price to rise, so the official price at this time is more than three times higher than the private price when they bought them, so they are happy. The new official price of gold is also very favorable (200 new notes, 600 million legal tender, higher than the private price), so many people are selling them. As for the old currency (legal tender limited to 10,000 yuan, which is actually rare in the market, only "Lord Guan" is still numerous), the exchange is slower, first, the exchange period is longer (three months), second, the small denomination auxiliary coins of the new currency have not yet appeared, and third, the prices of goods have not changed much, so it is more convenient to use. For example, a piece of tofu costs 100,000, but if it is marked in new currency, there will be an endless decimal of "0.3333..." under "3 cents". If the new small notes are issued, or according to the "5 in, 4 abandon 1" rule, it must be reduced to 90,000 a piece, but the merchant's mentality is to expect it to advance to "4 cents." Therefore, delaying the exchange of old currency and extending its period seems to be beneficial to both the government and the merchants. And although the old currency is worth little, the number is large, and keeping it to set off the identity of the new small notes is not without the subtle effect of "setting off the moon with clouds."</p>
<p>The public's interest in the new currency is due to being tired of the tedious and endless numbers for a long time, and suddenly seeing the prices of "a few cents" and "a few cents" again, there is a real impression of returning to the "good old days". Because from spring to summer, the price of ordinary transactions has also progressed from "10,000" to "100 million", and the trend will make "billion, trillion, and quadrillion" arise in series. After this reform, the word "billion" was first relegated to the cold palace, and "trillion" and "quadrillion" need not come out. And the prices marked on each item in the windows of foreign stores, many "circles," "circles," "circles," like reading astronomy to calculate the tonnage of the sun, are now all shortened, with fewer "zeros" and more decimal points, which can be called a refreshing change.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zixiang and Feng Chaoran</h3>
<p>— Hu Yaguang</p>
<p>In the past, there was an apprentice in a barber shop on Baike Road in Shanghai who often sneaked into a painting mounting shop next door to look at paintings. When the boss asked, he searched everywhere and finally found him in the painting mounting shop. He dragged him back to the shop and beat him severely. But after a short time, he would relapse. Later, whenever he disappeared, he would simply go straight to the painting mounting shop, and it was always a sure thing. Do you know who this apprentice is? It is the now famous painter Feng Chaoran! At that time, Zhang Zixiang was also selling paintings in Shanghai and often went to this painting mounting shop. Every time he saw such a small apprentice looking at calligraphy and paintings, and looking so engrossed, he thought it was strange. He found out that he was an apprentice in the barber shop next door. One day, Zhang Zixiang asked him why he liked looking at paintings so much. Feng Chaoran replied with tears in his eyes that he really liked learning to paint, but his environment did not allow it. Zhang Zixiang asked him to bring what he usually wrote and drew to take a look. Feng Chaoran brought a large bundle of landscapes, flowers, figures, and ladies, all of which were quite decent. Zhang Zixiang was amazed and resolutely asked him to leave the barber shop and was willing to teach him to paint. Later, Chaoran not only painted very well, able to surpass his teacher, but also quite successful in calligraphy and inscriptions. This is thanks to Zhang Zixiang's efforts to promote the younger generation, but without Chaoran's outstanding talent and willingness to work hard, there would be no achievements today!</p>
