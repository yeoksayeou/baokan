<h3>外長王世杰發表聲明　我國對日政策一貫　防止軍國主義復興必髯確有保障　一般國人決無反美情緒</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕外長王世杰五日就日本工業水準及其聯帶的賠償問題，發表聲明如次：</p>
<p>（一）盟國基本政策關於日本工業水準及賠償問題盟國之基本政策，已由一九四五年七月廿五日之波茨坦宣言予以訂定，該項宣言之第十一條稱：</p>
<p>「日本可保留足以使其維持經濟生活及支付公正的實物賠償之工業，但不得保留任何足以使其重整軍備之工業，為達到此種目的起見，日本可輸入原料，不得控制原料，在適當時期，日本得參加世界貿易」。　此項宣言，係由中，美，英三國政府領袖共同決定，以後並經蘇聯政府領袖同意，在日本投降之前，曾向日本人民公布其性質，實構成盟國間之相互約束。　（二）美國報吿日本投降後，美國政府於一九四六年曾遣派由飽萊率領之調查團赴日本及遠東各地調查，依鮑萊提出之報吿，通稱為鮑萊報吿，日本一切軍需工廠及其大部份普通工廠，可能移供軍用者，均應拆遷，一九四七年及一九四八年，美國政府復派遣由斯揣克及德雷伯分別領導之調查團赴日，調查報吿普通所稱為斯揣克報吿及德雷伯（或稱約翰斯敦）報吿，此兩項報吿，均主張日本得保留之工廠應多於鮑萊報吿之建議。　（三）遠東委員會目前之討論鮑萊報吿提出後，美國政府於一九四七年四月向遠東委會提出一日本工廠拆遷計劃，該會目前之討論，實際上仍採以鮑萊報吿之調查為基礎，出席遠東委會各國對於日本工業之保留範圍，迄今仍無協議，倘有所決定，依遠東委會之組織法規，非得中。美·英·蘇全體同意不可，在四國尙未獲得最後協議以前，美國政府已同意一種先期拆遷計劃，俾受害最深之四國得先行獲得部分的賠償，此四國係中·菲·英·荷，此種先期拆遷之工廠，我國應得半數。至於美國政府對於斯揣克報吿及德雷伯（或稱約翰斯敦）報吿之態度，吾人迄今尙未接獲美國政府之任何官方表示。</p>
<p>（四）我國政策關於此問題我國的政策，曾經一再明白表示，始終一貫，吾人贊成並且擁護波茨坦宣言之原則，吾人對於防止日本軍國主義之復興，必須有確定的保障，同時，吾人承認在普通經濟生活方面，須使日本能逐漸的自給自足，本年五月廿日蔣總統於其就職演詞中曾謂，中國對於日本不採報復主義，日本國民應可在盟國所定範圍內重建其經濟，以獲得生活的保障，本年四月十四日本人在國民大會外交報吿中，亦曾聲明「未來的對日和約，必須保障日本不能再事侵略，在經濟方面，我們不反對使日本人民自給自足，我們的目的要扶助一個新的民主的日本誕生，旣不要日走上軍閥復活的道路，也不要他走上赤化之路」。</p>
<p>防止日本的再侵略與給了日本人民一個自給自足的機會，這兩種要求如何調和，確是一個需要縝密考慮的工作，並可能使有關諸國政府發生爭議。中國政府與美國政府對於某某種日本工廠之應否拆遷，固常有不同之意見，但本人深信，中·美兩國政府均決無縱使日本重整軍備之意念，此種縱容對於一個抵抗日本侵略至十三年之久的政府，是不可想像的事，對於有珍珠港慘痛經騐的美國政府，也是一個不可想像的事。</p>
<p>本人並且深信，縱使國內一部份人士對此事不無憂慮或誤解，一般中國人士決無反美之情緒，因為這一個國家在上次世界大戰中是我們志同道合的朋友，在將來彼我也必須合作，以奠定世界的和平。</p>
<h3>財長王雲五視事　今後施政仍以開源節流為主　瘵舉辦新稅整頓稅收</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕新任財長王雲五，五日晨九時到部視事。並由前部長兪鴻鈞介紹，向財部職員訓話。兪氏首對王氏繼長財部加以讚揚，謂王為人公正廉明，做事以國家為重，相信將來定能採取有效措施，挽救經濟危機。繼並勗勉全體同仁，與王部長切實合作。旋王氏於掌聲中起立致詞，謂在國家最艱難時候，担任最艱難任務，在外人多以為昧於事實或不自量力，余則以為不然。關於本年下半年之總支出及最大可能之總收入，余費數日之時間，已有一點確切之了解。至是否「不自量力」一點，個人亦有自知之明。一年以來，個人參加全經會及預算審核委會，對財政經濟情形已有了解。在此國家財政經濟艱難之時，當本個人所了解之情形，力求改善，盡量做去。希望同人與其合作，共同努力，以完成使命。最後說明其施政方針，謂當此國家財政困難之時，軍公支用浩　，財部施政，仍以開源節流為主。節流當自財部本身做起，開源則為財部責無旁貸之事。並應自開闢稅源，整頓稅收做起。開闢稅源首在增加新稅，此雖非短時期所能奏效，但凡人民認為應該舉辦之新稅，符合有錢出錢之原則者，必定要辦。整頓稅收，則應使稅率與物價適應。至如何使稅收機關之稅款涓滴歸公，今後亦將加强督導。王氏論及今後金融及外滙政策謂金融管制政策大致不錯，以後將繼續切實執行。外匯政策，兪先生担任央行總裁後，已有改善。今後希望財部與央行合作，共同負責，力求外匯政策之完善。最後，王氏並勉全體同仁應多做事，少說話，切實努力，俾財政經濟有切實改善，以渡過目前經濟危機。</p>
<p>〔又電〕財長王雲五五日上下午均到部辦公，並個別接見財次徐柏園，李儻及部內高級職員，垂詢部內工作情形。並發表徐百齊為主任秘書，吳壯鈞為總務司長，趙琯為簡任秘書，其餘人事多未更動。國庫署長楊綿仲，錢幣司長載銘禮呈請辭職，經兪鴻鈞核准。繼任人選尙在物色中。傳已內定陳聘氶為發幣司長。公債司長陳炳章早請辭職，王雲五正慰留中。又悉：兪鴻鈞五日夜車返滬。</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕依憲法產生之首屆監察院五日開會，去年三月卅一日公布同年十二月廿五日及卅七年四月三日修正之監察院組織法，總統亦於五日發布命令，自五日起施行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕行憲監察院集會揭幕後，全體監委定六日晨九時謁陵，第一次預備會議定七日晨九時舉行，會中將首先推定臨時主席及臨時秘書長，籌備委會報吿籌備經過後，即討論以次各案：（一）監委會塲席次編定案，（二）監委互選院長，副院長辦法之擬訂案（三）監委互選院長·副院長投票及開票辦法與選舉事務進行程序之擬訂案。關於互選辦法，業經籌委會擬定草案，供作預備會議之參考資料。辦法中規定以全體監委為當然候選人，並規定選舉須有監委總額過半數之出席方得舉行，而得票達出席人數過半數之票數者為當選，惟如第一次無過半數人選，則以前三名舉行第二次投票，如再無過半數之票數，則以前二名舉行第三次投票，至第三次投票時，則以得票較多數者為當選。　〔本報南京五日電〕國民黨中常會曾決定推于右任應選監察院長，蔣總統五日復以國民黨總裁身份，向國民黨籍監委表示此意，同時說明副院長希望推選劉哲。蔣總統係於五日下午五時在勵志社茶會招待國民黨籍監察委員，于右任，劉哲亦應邀出席，蔣總統即表示本黨同志應擁護于·劉兩氏，一部份監委表示反對立法院長為南方人，監院長即應為北方人之意見，但對總裁所提人選大多表示擁護，劉哲曾即席對各監委表示謝意，至六時許散會</p>
<h3>對司徒雷登大使聲明　胡適稱大體同意　日本不可能再成為侵略國</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕胡適對司使的聲明，表示大體同意。他看過聲明全文後說：裏面許多話都是我從前說過的。我和他的意見差不多。胡氏今午接見記者時，一手從寫字台角落裏提出字紙簍，一手指着說：這裏面有許多是各地給我的信。為着美國對日問題，我已經挨了不少駡了。但他終於仍說明了如下的意見：第一，美國或任何盟國，都不會允許日本重整軍備，恢復侵略的能力。社會上很多話，都是謠傳。事實上，日本的海軍，空軍，甚至民用航空，陸軍，殖民地，都沒有了。在這樣情形下，日本已不可能再度成為侵略國家。同時同盟　對於剝除日本的侵略力量，意見也是一致的。第二，所謂美國扶植德，日，實際是以其工業生產力，恢復和平工業的生產，養活他們自己。使一億五千萬的人口，能和和平平的過最低限度的生活。有些人看了不免眼紅，戰後二年，自己還未走到和平安全的生活，更未恢復繁榮，看見人家恢復的比我們還快，感覺不平。一般正當的批評和恐懼，大部由此而來。也不一定完全有作用。也有辦工業的人，感到威脅。如英印和中國紡織業，都感恐惻。不過超過了正當的憂慮，談美國給戰時的敵國保留工業，就是有作用的把它扶植起來，那是不對的。我們就是被人扶植的國家。如果把扶植就當作扶植侵略力量，豈不大錯？胡氏說明日本恢復工作較快，由於在麥克阿瑟的統一管理下，而不是像柏林四國分管朝鮮的南北分治。由於日本恢復的快，中國恢復的慢，我們只能憂慮自己。說句公道話，不能由於自己倒霉不長進不繁榮，也希望別人同自己一樣倒霉，所以雖是正當的憂慮也有點不很正當。並稱有人藉機煽動反美</p>
<p>梅貽琦亦表同情</p>
<p>並稱有人藉機煽動反美</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕梅貽琦對司徒大使聲明，大部同情，渠認為美國扶植日本，使其人民能自給生活，是正常的，而非有意恢復日本之侵略力量。日本已失去其舊日侵略基礎，未來和會中，中國應堅持否決權，並應不使日本恢復九一八以後侵略國時期之工業水準，梅氏繼稱目前高唱反對美國扶日者，一部因為躭心日本再起，而有人藉機煽動反美亦係事實。司徒不以對中國政府抗議，而採聲明方式是對的。</p>
<h3>總統致詞全文　勉發揮五權制度宏效　奠國家長治久安基礎</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕蔣總統五日上午在第一屆監察院集會開幕典禮中致詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>行憲首屆監察院，今日如期集會，本人至感快慰。諸位先生係由各省市參議會及蒙古·西藏地方機構曁華僑團體選舉而來，對於民生情形，政治利病，自甚明瞭，將來各抒碩正，集思廣益，協助政洽改進，解除民衆痛苦，對國家民族一定有偉大的貢獻。</p>
<p>國父畢生致力國民革命，其目的在求中國之自由平等，而其方法即為實行三民主義，五權憲法，為民權主義之具體綱領，其精義所在。要使人民有權，政府有能，吾人認眞遵行，必可使政府賢能，政治淸明，監察權之獨立行使，為五權與三權之基本區別，故監察權之推行成功，亦即五權憲法理想之成功，諸位先生從今日始，已負起推行監察權之重責，五權憲法，實為最優良最進步之制度，將於此證之。</p>
<p>自訓政時期之監院　過渡至行憲監察院，法律性質雖有不同，而事實上之發展過程，則自有其一貫性。訓政時期之監察院，成立於民國二十年，至本屆監察院集會之日為止，歷時十有七載，初僅行使彈劾，審計二權，已有不少貢獻，抗戰期間，為因應實際需要，乃增加糾舉·建議二權，施行以來，尤茂績效，根據以往經騐，故憲法中所規定之監察院職職，除將建議改為糾正以加强效能外，並賦予同意權，俾對國家任用最高司法考試人員時，亦能事前監察，凡此逐步發展之經過，足見訓政期間，各監察委員認眞執行任務，已博得國人之信任，亦足見國家對於今後行憲監察院屬望之股切。</p>
<p>方今憲政伊始，國人喁喁望治，同時國家於八年抗戰之後，繼以戡亂，經濟艱難，民生困苦，達於極點，於此時期，亟應各方協同力謀改進，職責雖有專屬，努力必須一致。諸位先生當能一本人民願望，國家利益，繼續訓政時期監察院未竟之功，完成憲法所賦予之偉大任務，本人受國家付託，負行憲重責，凡憲法賦予貴院之職　，自必依法遵行，使之完全行使，以期發揮五權制度之宏效，而奠定國家長治久安之基礎，願與各位共勉之。蔣總統在監院集會時致詞（中央社攝）</p>

<h3>工程師節感言</h3>
<p>工程的民生觀　趙曾玨</p>
<p>工程師的實任是「利用厚生」，而此處之「生」，應該是民生。引申言之，工程師的責任是以科學方法，運用人力物力，為人類謀取　美的生活。古今中外沒有一個著名工程，不是攸關民生福利的，也沒有一個著名工程師，不是謀取民生福利的。今天工程師節，我們所紀念的夏禹和他的治水工程，就是一個最好的例證。後世李冰父子之於都江水利，現代李義祉之於關中水利，也是很好的例證。在上海的邊緣沿上川鐵路有一條海塘名欽公塘，係前淸川沙縣令欽運所興建，自上海吳淞展接至奉賢縣境數十公里，防止海潮浸入，保護農田，所以他雖是滿洲人，但民衆至今稱道不衰。固然這些水利方面的工程溥利民生，最為廣大深厚，所以特別受到當代以至後世的歌頌；實則其他的工程，即如條築鐵路公路，建造橋梁，興構房屋等等，那一樣不是有利民生呢？</p>
<p>現有更有一個規模偉大，意義深遠，幾乎曠絕前代，而使世界人士刮目相看，認為新民主時代之開始的民生福利事業，這就是美國羅斯福總統所倡導TVA的多元工程。它是完全由工程師設計主持的一個機電，化工，土木，水利，交通，醫藥工程的綜合體，也是一個農工商業，激育，衛生事業的綜合體，而它的組織是一個獨立於政治系統之外的企業化機構，尤為其特色。因為是一種創制，所以它在開始之時，未嘗不這到反對。但因為整個機構的努力，和受益的普暹，所以終得成功，又因為確能溥利民生，功效昭著，所以終得人民的擁劃，且使全世界進步人士驚喜贊歎，而不勝其憧憬　往之情。</p>
<p>根據以上中外的先例，吾們敢說一個政府或機關或個人，凡能為民衆謀福利，所謂『登人民於衽席』沒有不被擁戴的，也沒有不克成功的。而這種眞實為民衆謀福利的艱鉅工作，沒有不靠了工程師的努力而究成的。所以工程師的最大使命即是解決民生問題，而在肩負此偉大使命中，我們認識到的是：（一）凡屬溥利民生的工程，　是有價値的工程。（二）工程是應當圖遠功的，而不應當計近利的。（三）工程不是商業，它的價値應以有利民生與否為衡量，而不應單以幣値來計算。</p>
<p>上述三點，或可作為工程師努力的目標。就我國論，假如還是依循數千年來農業社會的軌轍，而不走上工業化的這路，恐怕離以競存於現代的世界。所以在此時會，我們工程師的責任，眞是空前的重火，工程師不建設，誰來建設？工程師不推動工業化的巨輪，誰來推動？今日是工程師節，是我們工程師檢討過去，策動來茲的節日，故特提供一些管見，請大家指敎。</p>
<p>工程師的時代使命　徐恩曾</p>
<p>一年一度的六六工程師節，不覺又到臨了，經濟蕭條，產業類　，這是一個不得了的危機局而。我們以建設新中國自負的工程節願志，還是廢然長　，坐以待斃呢，還是猛省檢討，盡心力而為之呢，今天的世界，實在是一個技術競賽的世界，技術優良國家，可以增進效率，减低成本，最近五月號英文波者文摘發表了一價小統計，指出蘇俄工人如購買一磅麺包，要工作一小時又七分，而美國則僅需七分半鐘，也就是說美國效率要比蘇俄高十倍。美國技術的優越，工業的成就，資本家和工人雖然也有大貢獻，而工程師的貢獻，至少是可以和資本家工人鼎足而三的。</p>
<p>我國工學院出身的學生，為數也不算少，在校成績也不算壞，在歐美各國留學的工學院學生，其　業成績也多能超過各留學國一班同學。少數留駐原留學國服務的工程師，他們因為有良好的工作設備與環境，成績異常良好，極為各國工程師與工業界所稱道。而在國內工作的工程師們，往往用非所學，有從政者，有經商者，即在本崗位工作者，不是在學校敎書，便是在政府任技術行政工作，能對中國工業建設有眞正貢獻者，為數極少。我們也可以把責任推到政府身上，推到工業界身上，推到社會環境，而我們自己當年選修工學的雄心，抱負，以及國家的工業衰頽，技術落後現象，是不會自己改善的。</p>
<p>我們工程師同志們，必需改變過去的消極態度，我們要爭取主動，爭取為國家　務，為工業界服務的機會。我們當然不願作資本家走狗，可是我們也不應該處心積慮，天天為自己打算，自己想作資本家。因為國家的統制經濟政策，工人的堅强集團陣綫，私人企業家剝奪工人利益，逃避政府稅政的機會，在他國早已不復存在了。中國戰時戰後，雖然有不少混水摸魚的投機份子，在短時期內發過國難，內戰財，而我們這班有抱負，有本領的工程師們，是不願如此糟蹋自己多年的學養，斷送自己遠大的前程的，時局稍為平定，國家上了軌這以後，這班投機份子是要被淘汰的，被淸算的。誰是有眞本領，誰的工作最努力，祇能為國家民族打算的，就是未來的民族工程師，就是未來的經濟建設的主持人。</p>
<p>今天的世界，顯然已經分出勞資兩大壁壘，工程師是勞資雙方的自然居間人，他硏究設計的現代機械，是要用巨大炎本去置備的，工程師自然深知資本對於工業的貢獻，這些機械當然也可以多數繼續自動進行，而仍然是要有相當數量的工人照料的，勞工的貢獻，也是主持工務的工程師們所熟知的。我們要資本家有興趣投資，要工人有興趣努力工作，不怠工，不罷工，雙方的利益都是要兼顧的。除了身臨其境的工程師們；誰又能了解雙方利害，誰又能調和雙方衝突呢！本</p>
<h3>扶順煤礦突擊增產　造成接收來最高紀錄</h3>
<p>— 瀋陽航信　本報記者　趙展</p>
<p>撫順煤礦五月份總產量十四萬六千八百二十二噸，輸出量九萬三千三百九十六噸，突破以往記錄，造成接收以來生產量的最高紀錄。去年五月，號稱東北工礦事業的全盛時代，撫順每月的最高產量只是十三萬七千六百噸，輸出量七萬九千卅六噸。一年以來，烽火蔓延，一般人都感嘆東北工礦事業支離破碎，日見凋零—失望的情緒將達冰點，但撫順創造的奇蹟是驚人的，它給悲觀主義當頭一棒。</p>
<p>根據撫順礦務局統計，最近三月，它的增產紀錄是：三月份總產量十萬七千六百廿二噸，預計輸出四萬五千噸，實際輸出五萬噸左右，四月份總產量十萬八千七百八十四噸，預計輸出五萬噸，實際輸出六萬一千六百噸，五月份總產量，十四萬六千八百廿二噸，預計輸出八萬噸，實際輸出九萬三千三百九十六噸。五月份每晶生產量最高到六千八百八十噸，每日平均產量為四千七百三十六噸，遝輸紀錄最高達一百七十三火車，計五千二百〇八噸，也打破歷來的運輸紀錄。三月份以前的煤產量，平均為每日二千噸至三千噸。</p>
<p>生產鬥爭　「奇蹟」是怎樣造成的？撫順礦務局長魏華鵾對記者說：「這是工人一鍬一鎬的收獲，全體工人努力增產的成績」。魏局長是二月廿日接長礦局，在他接任後第二天（廿一日）的產量是二千三百三十九噸，他解釋那時生產效率低落的原因，第一是沒有錢，積欠工人兩個月薪金及糧米代金；第二是待遇不平，職員薪金太高，工人薪金太低。因為這種緣故，工人天天請願，無心工作，同時一部份職員忙着逃難，造成普遍不安的情緒，差點使撫順咽了氣。他的辦法是先償還工人的欠債，每個工人的口袋裏都裝滿兩百萬元流通券。提高工人的待遇，以後來請願的是職員，不再是工人。五一勞動節放假一天，唱大戲樂工人，這一天工人的太太都擦胭脂抹粉，小孩子每人有一瓶汽水，於是全撫順都笑哈哈，工人的心裏開了花，生產的慾望刺激起來了，展開了熟烈的增產運動，流通券與物價競賽，生產與流通券競賽，一塲眞正的生產鬥爭，使撫順起死回生，更有趣的是局長聲言要「自殺」，督促工人。</p>
<p>撫順自成一個完整的工業體系，雖然東北光復後被蘇軍拆卸得不完整了，但以煤為中心，其副產品仍有八十餘種。往昔撫順煤礦在東北經濟資源上佔着炫耀的地位，現在它獨力支撑東北的艱困局而，是更有價値，由兵工廠製造炸彈，到市民燒飯的火爐，都依賴着它。</p>
<p>重要副產　重要的副產品，如油母頁岩中提煉汽油，在鐵路寸斷的東北，正和血一樣寳貴。汽油三月份產量一萬八千四百八十加侖，五月份增加至六萬一千加侖。兵工廠最需要的硫酸錏，三月份生產三百零七噸，四月份增產至四百九十二噸，打破已往紀錄。構築防禦工事不能缺少的水泥，三月份生產九十噸，四月份增產三百零四噸，其製鋼廠為國內唯一特殊鋼製造廠，產品五百噸自六月一日起開始空運關內，這種鋼材是國內最需要的，以前需要自外國購買。五月份鋼材計產六十噸，其中炭素工具錮四月份產二十二噸，彈黃鋼四月份產六噸，竹紮工具鋼三月份產十五噸，歡鋼三月份產廿噸。此外特稱柴油四月份產一百五十九加侖，混合機器汕四月份產四千加侖，軟瀝青四月份產十九噸，氧氣四月份產一千九百八十七立方米，氫氣四月份產一百五十五立方米，硫酸　土四月份產三十九噸，液體阿母尼亞四月份產五百七十七公斤，電石五月份產二百二十七噸。有一部副產品產量過小，不再介紹，有很多其他副產品因電力不足，無法生產</p>
<p>克服困難　撫順在增產的熱浪中，並不是沒有困難，不過困難不能使生產低弱，工人的突擊精神克服了客觀環境的困難條件，最大的困難是資金，糧食，材料的缺乏，這幾乎是不能順利解決的老問題。三·四·五月份的員工薪金雖已按數發給，但因銀行缺乏現鈔，行轅撥款不能按時提現，往往是現鈔到手，物價已漲，預算足用之數，此時又吿虧損。自煤價照糧價計算的辦法實行後，資金的困難已經减少。在此靑黃不接之時，糧食問題的確嚴重，目前豆餅是四萬工人的生要食料，渴望着小麥成熟。煤產雖增，然坑木，炸藥，剝離機械之修報零件等奇缺，萬購困難，影響很大，這些困難，隱約顯示生產前途的一層陰影。就純粹技術的觀點而言，這一種不顧一切的增產，或有許多弱點，但在東北危困的特殊局面下，也只有大量產煤一個目標。</p>
<p>豆饼小姐　撫順的每個礦工都成為勞動英雄了，使撫順「返老還童」，創造「奇蹟」的是偉大的人力，而支持這偉大人力的是豆餅和豆渣。在六月一日創刋的「工友」五日刋副葉上，刋載一封工人向豆餅小姐求愛的信，他寫着：「我自從接近您的芳容，眞是一見如故，我呌慾一聲親愛的豆餅小姐，老實說，我離了您就不能生存」。魏華鵾局長說：「我們的工人太可愛了，我相信煽動工潮是決不可能的。」</p>
<p>撫順煤礦五月的生產量和迷輸量，打破東北光復三年來的紀錄，這種偉大的成績，是上下一心團結努力的結果。記者看到工人們昂揚的生產欲望，和興奮的工作情緒，眞是感動不置！使我們知道，在砲火瀰漫的東北，工礦有新的生機。</p>

<h3>楊妹九年不食原因　必須早日覓獲答案　胡先文等發表意見</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶五日電〕市立中正醫院院長胡先文，外科主任胡先華發表「我們究應以什麽態度來評斷楊妹的不食問題」，內分（一）楊妹成為國際人物，（二）楊妹受初步檢查的經過，（三）楊妹是否應成為研究的對象，（四）科學是什麼，（五）尾語。對楊廿一日來始終未進食及大便，且排尿反較飮水為多，究係何種奧妙，迄感不解。文中曾述及有Succi者，平生專以絕食為職業，供作生理學家研究，某次在巴黎科學館實驗，以五十日不食造成渠平生不食最高紀錄，惟在絕食數日後，體重體力精神一致减退，第四十日體重已减輕百分之廿五，最後數日體質衰弱，幾無法維持。另英人Terence市長，於一九二〇年愛爾蘭政爭時，也因絕食七十四日死亡。楊妹廿一日觀察期內，暫雖未作臨床檢查，然體重，體力，精神，呼吸，並較以上二人對飢餓之耐力尤有過之，脈博溫度始終保持不變，故不論伊是否由於特殊生理機構，病理變化，或人為裝作，當應以純客觀態度研究，早求解答。</p>
<p>胡院長等認為硏究科學應着重事實，與探求實驗結果，廿一日之初步觀察後，即對楊不食原因遽下評斷，實太冒險。復稱：科學家的頭腦，應像一張純潔無庛白紙，本身不帶任何色彩，必須以純客觀態度，虛心觀察自然界的現象，綜合各項實驗結果，加以詳細分析，從事實上求得肯定或否定答案。楊妹不食廿一日，無顯著變態，科學家即應追隨此現象辨明是非曲直，萬一楊妹長期不食成為定論，無法以現有知識解釋，則糾正以往若干理論上之錯誤，尋覓一新的科學途徑，切忌冷視或固執，以為與現有理論不合，即捨棄現有機會現象或事實，殊失科學家探討奧妙宇宙眞諦。目前人士對楊妹深感興趣者，頗多受九年不食渲染影響，然科學家應抱絕對客觀態度，楊妹廿一日不食，渠等親自參加觀察，實為常人無法辦到事實，故楊妹為一科學硏究對象，應母庸議。胡氏昆仲最後稱：此神秘不食原因，必須早日覓獲答案，免混淆社會聽聞。</p>
<p>〔又電〕衛生部對楊妹不食事，迄無批示，衛生局頃又將楊妹三週來觀察報告，寄呈衛生部醫政司。</p>

<h3>消減援歐援華款項案　美衆院表決通過　勃奇主恢復援日基金</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓四日電〕美衆院今於口頭表決時，通過撥款委會之法案，將援華計劃中之四億六千三百萬美元，削减六千三百萬美元。並將政府之援外款額，减為五十九億另七十一萬另二百二十八美元。擁護政府之人士，正期待參院於表決此項法案時，將法案已核减之五億三千三百萬美元之援外款額予以恢復。現參院撥款委會對援外法案之審查工作尙未完成，故參院撥款委會可能將衆院委會所削减之數予以恢復。自對歐洲復原計劃與援華計劃提出修正案，擬將其時期减為一年之舉被否決案，衆院對援外法案，即未作重大修改而予通過。上述擬將援助時期由十五個月减為一年，籍以比例恢復被核减之援外款額之修正案，卒以一百四十八票對一百十三票被否決。法案之援華部份，僅小有修改，蓋衆院曾通過周以德之修正案，將有關監視款項用途之規定之文字略予修改，使語意更為婉轉。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓四日合衆電〕據官方高級人士稱，參院撥款委會主席勃里奇已向陸軍部及國務院提供諾言，願極力使參院恢復衆院撥款委會業已拒絕批准之日本經濟善後基本一億五千萬元議案之討論。</p>

<p>此間外交觀察家相信希臘政府之此一行動，是否能引起巴爾幹之和平，尙須視希臘遊擊運動問題之能否解決而定。希避擊隊司令馬柯斯之於六月一日發表試探和平之廣播，或許仍為莫斯科最近所發動和平攻勢之一部。該廣播曾曰，希臘遊擊隊準備討論任何以終止兄弟殘殺為目的之建議。馬柯斯發表該一廣播之前，保加利亞及阿爾巴尼亞政府亦已聲明願在某種條件下，與雅典政府恢復關係。</p>

<h3>河南路硫磺爆炸大火災　列傷百餘消防警長殉職　食庫肇禍四隣遭殃損失無從估計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨午後五時十分，河南路三三三弄十號衆發倉庫堆存之硫磺，正在搬運時，突然失　，以致起火，其後大宗硫磺起火燃燒，一齊爆炸，致肇大禍，死傷一百餘名，殃及四隣，損失無從估計，造成民國廿二年二月廿一日正泰橡膠廠鍋爐爆炸事件後，十餘年來少有之大火慘劇。出事時因適値東區寫字問下班，車輛擁塞，行人突聞轟然巨響，繼之烟硝冲天，高蔽太空，不及探詢，即競相奔避，附近居民與商店更倉皇閉門打烊，秩序大亂。火塲週圍如南京路，九江路，河南中路，漢口路，山東路一帶所有窗戶及櫉窗大玻璃，在爆炸時什九俱吿震碎，估計僅此一項損失已在千餘億以上。火起後消防處出動本市各區救火車計十五輛，以三十餘根水苗全力撲救，因之水源會一度吿竭，臨時電英商自來水公司增加出事區域水壓，直至五時五十分始克遏制高達千餘尺之火頭及二百平方尺之火塲。至七時許方將火燄撲滅，前後延燒計歷兩小時。火警中除衆發倉庫及協大藥行，順泰紙號全部焚燬外，鄰近之新聞報，商報，老正興，同華樓菜館，通匯銀行宿舍等俱遭殃及。其中新聞報之棧房，因在衆發緊鄰亦不幸被焚，商報內部遭受水潰，損失俱極車大。火起時中央區隊服務已達二十一年之消防車駕駛警長命長根，在駕車到達火場之瞬問，即為因爆炸而彈出之火柱所擊中，當塲殉職。消防警，搬運小工，及行人居民等受重似經車送各醫院有姓名可查者計四十六人，其中三人延至今晨一時不治斃命。其餘受輕傷者尙有六十人。至肇事原因及損害實際情形現正由警局全力調查中。</p>
<h3>轟然一聲　黑煙衝天　消防處員警奔救　多不及穿救火衣</h3>
<p>火起時，因倉庫位在弄內深處，初不為人覺，迨見新聞報隔壁弄內奔出工人模樣者三人，衣履盡已着火，始為路人發現，急為其脫卸衣履，則皮肉已灼傷甚重。其中一人當即不支踣地，為狀極可怖，一時路人多狂奔趨避。不旋踵間，果見白烟已自河南路三三三弄慶和里中直衝半空，時為下午五時十分正。</p>
<p>消防處中央區隊，位於河南路漢口路之南，距火塲近在咫尺，一睹白烟衝天，消防員多不及穿救火衣，即隨車出發。一輛開赴漢口路，一輛駛往九江路，斯時白烟瀰漫，益見濃厚。正當消防員卸下水帶，準備衝入弄內灌救之際，不料轟然一身，突起爆炸，一股黑烟衝天，高達千呎，更見火熖如傘，高熱異常，時為下午五時二十分。隨爆炸聲後，火塲中突飛出火燒之木柱一條，適落於剛停於老正興門口之三十一號消防車上，不幸擊中駕駛警長兪長根頭部，常塲殉職。同時消防警長邱祥雲亦受重傷。</p>
<p>八根苗子難殺火威</p>
<p>消防員奮不顧身，接通水管，分在九江路漢口路兩處開始出水。惟雖經八根苗子努力灌救，因硫磺勢猛，難殺火威。旋虹口區靜安寺區及宜昌路消防隊瞭望台，均已見衝天烈熖，與新閘滬北等區相繼出動帮浦車十輛，分頭趕到。同時中央區隊再加派巨型帮浦車一輛，雲梯車一輛，水帶車一輛，集中山東路漢口路河南路儿江路一帶，施用苗子增至卅餘根，因而附近所有出水龍頭幾不够分配，當由消防處葉科長急電英商自來水公司，對火塲區加强水壓，拼命灌救。</p>
<p>東風助虐　火舌四竄</p>
<p>衆發倉庫瞬即全燬，火舌延及東鄰新聞報紙棧，西鄰協大藥行，北鄰九江路二七五號二七七號順泰紙號及二七三號老正興菜館，二八一號同華樓菜館。其時東風甚烈，火舌復又西竄至二八九號商報大厦，曁二九五號通滙銀行上層三樓宿舍。經消防員警四十分鐘之拼命灌救後，火勢始獲控制。</p>
<p>兩家報館　損失慘重</p>
<p>當時新聞報除紙棧全部焚毁外，館內五樓職員宿舍二間，三四樓工人宿舍，及銅版攝影冲洗室，亦遭殃及。大廈後部所有各層玻璃窗，於硫磺爆炸，悉數震碎，無一完整。朝北　牆，受震谿裂，印刷部印　機二架受損，其中一架因受熱過度鉛版熔化，鉛汁流入機器內部，修理不易，馬達機件受水浸蝕，一時無法使用，此外紙張，油　等印刷材料遭受水漬者，尙難統計。至商報館方面，三樓員工宿舍亦全部被災，二樓編輯採訪部及下層印刷部均受水漬，損失綦重。迨全部火勢撲滅，已為下午七時。</p>
<p>當起火時，中央消防處處長周兆祥督率中隊附張　，科長葉斌勇，區隊長朱志峯，副隊長林伯華，及各區隊部，努力施救。救護總站王副總站長，港口消防處官長亦到塲。火塲方面除總局刑事處員警及飛行堡壘，保警大隊到塲外，該管黃浦分局長馮文堯偕刑事股長李蔭民亦率警　到，會同憲兵等維持秩序。警局長俞叔平於起火後不久且親臨指揮。消防員警，奮不顧身之精神，深為附近居民稱頌。</p>
<p>起火原因</p>
<p>至起火原因，係衆發倉庫於昨日下午五時許，自天潼路三一八弄施富記運輸行裝來大批硫磺，正由搬運工人七人裝卸之際，不愼起火，當時撲救不及，數分鐘後延至硫磺堆中，遂起爆炸。當時在新聞報隔弄內所見逃出之三工人，即係參加撲救之搬運小工。該項硫磺據聞係新生火柴廠所存儲。又事後據悉，尙有小工一人失踪，可能已葬身火窟。</p>
<p>震碎玻璃極多</p>
<p>各路商店玻窗受震損壞者有如下數十家：漢口路申報，輪船業同業公會，南京路麗華公司，老介福綢縀局，望平街口老九和綢縀局，河南路美最時理髮舖，大元工業西藥原料行，春華堂牋扇號，生昌參行，永固造漆公司，惠僑國際貿易公司，福泰和綢布莊，和祥信託公司，大集成皮貨局，農民銀行信託部，立信會計圖書印品社，時和首飾行，裕記九華堂，會文堂書局，農商銀行，寳記　華堂牋扇號，恒豐昌皮貨局，天協成象牙號，利羣文具社，華興利鐘錶號，復興參號，中央日報。山東路新德茂壽衣舖，大衆晚報，馬敦和帽莊，元元帽莊，廣申　廠，大滬理髪店，黃金印刷所，美麗印刷所，萬隆紙號，華昌貿易所，一大印刷所，中國切紙公司及維羅廣吿社。九江路和成銀行，信中錢莊。</p>

<h3>兩路客貨運漲價　可能明天實行　客運加五成　貨運加九成</h3>

<h3>當局監護勸阻學生　大遊行未實現　各處全日平靜無事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市一部份學生組織之「反對美國扶植日本聯合會」，本定於昨晨聯合全市各校，舉行反扶日示威遊行。卒賴各治安軍警敎育等有關當局，監護勸阻，遊行之舉，終吿分頭凍結。</p>
<p>上午十時左右，治安當局為避免學生利用外灘中山等公園為集合中心，分將該園等暫行封閉。交大方面，晨起即有軍警嚴密監護，遊行學生，終日未能越雷池半步。同濟大學，僅有少許遊行學生，先期離校外出，次批遊行學生，即遭勸阻。復旦大學方面，下午一時許，有學生三百餘人集隊，準備自大門出發，經軍警勸阻後，曾另覓若干捷徑，迂迥出發，均經分別勸阻回校。上海美專一度有毆鬥糾紛，旋即平息。中華工商專科學校遊行學生，亦被軍警勸阻於朱葆三路。外灘方面至下午三時以後，始有大中學生千餘人集合，惟亦於六時許分別散去。茲誌各方面勸阻詳情如次二</p>
<h3>交大苦勸學生經過</h3>
<p>交通大學學生自治會於三日晚舉行「反對美國扶日」問題座談會後，四日下午五日召開各系科代表大會，決定五日總請假一天，舉行「反對美國扶植日本搶救民族危機大遊行」，並聯絡其他各校參加。該校當局聞訊後，由程孝剛校長會同各院系負責人漏夜召集學生會方面幹事談話，剴切勸導，自晚十時至翌晨三時。該校上海同學會會長趙曾珏及警察局局長兪叔平等，亦到校勸阻，敎部朱部長及吳市長則以電話與程校長聯絡，請阻止學生是項行動。但各方勸阻均屬無效，學生仍堅持原來主張。校方乃於四日深夜張貼佈吿作最後勸導稱：「頃悉本日下午學生自治會未經呈准本校，擅自召開所謂系科代表大會，並公開發動於五日總請假及外出遊行示威之舉。該生等不惜荒廢學業作驚外之行動，未得本校許可，妄自主張，殊屬不合。業經本校召開各院系科主管人座談會議，會認為對於遊行舉動決應嚴予制止，以免肇生事端，並須照常上課，俾維學業。倘有不聽學校善意勸阻，故作主張，萬一堅持出外遊行，因而發生意外事件，除其本身應受法律制裁者外，本校並以違抗校規分別嚴予懲處」。該校校長程孝剛及各院系負責人王之車，裘維裕，鍾兆琳等十六人，並發表書面談話，聲稱「如學生方面仍不明同人等苦勸善意，固執成見，則同人等深感敎導無方，祇得全體引退」。</p>
<p>學生會方面因諸師長之勸導，於昨晨十時召開緊急系科代表大會，將大遊行之決議案付複議。程校長及敎授多人再蒞會勸導。程校長剴切說明各稱利害關係，囑學生勿憑一時之情感衝動，應運用理智，作明智之舉，取消遊行。程校長表示反美扶日不必一定須以總請假及遊行方式表達，如用發表宣言等方式亦可。若學生仍堅持遊行，校方之勸阻再失敗，則渠本人及敎授將決定辭職，各系科代表對是否遊行事，乃重加討論，直至下午二時，表決結果仍決定遊行，是時治安當局早已調派警備大隊，保安警察各一大隊及靑年軍一營與坦克車十餘輛，先後到達徐家匯一帶，斷絕附近交通，將該校前後校門圍住，阻止學生出校遊行。校內之交大學生，則於下午二時許整隊集合三四百人，各執漫畫旗幟，先在校內繞行一週，因前後門均有軍警嚴　在外監護，未能外出，僵持甚久，隊伍乃在校內高呼各種「反扶日」口號後，即吿解散。在外監護之軍警至晚九時半左右始吿撤去。</p>

<h3>學生約千人唱歌呼口號　排列外灘人行道上　交通阻滯公園關門</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）外灘方面，學生本傳有，在外灘公園集合之訊，故治安當局，於昨日上午十時半起，即將外灘公園封閉，暫停開放。上午外難方面學生，無顯著集合跡象，惟外灘一段馬路，時有小隊　巡及軍警往來巡邏。下午三時許，學生集合漸多，因外灘公園已暫停開放，故咸排列在外灘廿四號至廿八號一段人行道上，數約千人，大部均係中學生。就個別向各學生探詢，所屬學校，有約翰·交通·大夏·復旦等大學，及麥倫·儲能·同濟附中等中學。治安當局亦陸續派到保警四中隊，及騎巡一分隊，分別監護列隊之學生。各學生除唱歌及呼口號外，別無舉動。若干擬行離隊之學生，則暫遭拘留。一時外灘觀者如堵，交通稍受阻碍。至六時許，各學生始個別或分小隊陸續散去。</p>
<h3>天市長舉行記者招待會　報告學生特殊行動經過　責成交大當局　進行查問七點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕為本市大中學生決議於昨天總請假，舉行「反對美國扶植日本」大遊行事，吳市長及宣司令特於昨日下午五時，在市府大禮堂舉行記者招待會。首由吳市長報吿交大學生之特殊行動經過情形，略稱：交大於昨日下午三時，召開各科系大會，於五時散會，會中決議今日總請似，並舉行大遊行。該校校長接獲報吿，當即加以勸止無效。吳市長及　局長聞訊後，以遊行違背戡亂時期緊急處置辦法，必須嚴予禁止，特令該校轉吿學生，萬一因遊行而發生意外時，一概由學生負全責，政府絕無責任。同時該校校長及二十餘教授並聯合署名出示佈吿，警吿二點：（一）集體遊行，違反校規，參加者皆依校規嚴辦。（二）若學生執迷不悟，堅持出外遊行，敎授當負管敎不嚴之責，不得已將全體請辭。</p>
<p>研究學生堅持之理由　當局認為受共匪操縱</p>
<p>此後，校長及敎授又盡力勸吿學生，放棄遊行，與學生反覆辯論歷時甚久，而學生仍固執堅持，渠等最後之唯一理由，厥為：「今日之大遊行，係本市一百二十個團體所共同決定者，渠等必須如約前往外灘公園集會，一致出發。</p>
<p>根據上述學生堅持之理由，市政當局認為大遊行之受共匪操縱已極明顯，因交大科系會於遊行之前日始行決定，若幕後無人操縱，則如何能與其他一百二十團體不謀而合？為此，市政當局認為極有追究之必要。吳市長謂若此種事件發生在外國，當可立即召開檢察庭，令肇事者公開答覆，現政府為尊重學校當局起見，請校方先行負責對此次遊行之主動者實行查問，將查問結果，作公開答覆，否則政府將令其交出，循法律途徑審訊之。</p>
<p>正式致交大公文</p>
<p>市府昨已有正式公文致交大，述明應行查問之七點如下：（一）何人向系科代表大會要求行動。（二）在系科代表大會上何人主張罷課遊行。（三）在系科代表大會内何人提出十一時聚餐，一時在外灘集合。（四）系科代表大會下午三時始開，五時始畢，何時與一百廿餘團體聯繫，決定同時出發在外灘集合。（五）若在五時表決以後始開始聯繫，用何種方法能如此神速的與一百廿餘團體聯繫（此為不可能之事）。（六）若在系科代表大會以前即與各團體聯繫採取共同行動，則應問代表交大究係何人，在何地與何人聯擊。（一）一百廿餘團體其名目為何，主持何人。</p>
<p>學潮影響治安　市民應具戒心</p>
<p>司令致詞略稱：大遊行全係共黨有計劃之陰謀，政府於得到消息後，即分頭勸止。到現在為止，各大學學生在軍警防範下已無法出校，現在外灘集合者，全係中學生。宣司令對昨日之遊行終未成功，表示欣慰。惟宣司令對今後之學潮問題，頗具戒心。渠表示本市學潮自五月迄今，始終乘機待動，雖尙未釀大禍，’然深信經月餘之培養，各校之基礎已吿穩固，匪徒眼見其在各校之潛勢力已逐漸長成，必設法加以運用。渠預計計今後學潮恐將影響社會治安，市民應具戒心。</p>
<p>嚴究職業學生</p>
<p>吳市長則强調學生之越軌行動，決非愛國，渠等遊行口號為「反對美國扶植日本」，實則為反對美國援助中國。對於特殊之職業學生，政府決予嚴究，重辦。</p>

<h3>無錫繭行停秤　鮮繭超越限價中停農付貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫四日電〕四鄉繭行自三日開秤以來，因繭戶觀望，不願出售，致鮮繭價每担超出三千萬外，與協道會限價二六〇〇萬相差甚鉅。四日午後所有全縣貸款繭行一〇二家，因協導會及中農亭付貸款，無法收繭，一律停秤。當晚八時，協導會及繭行公會有關方面特如開緊急會議，決定電請當局繼續貸款，其超出部份，由廠商暫行設法墊付。此項辦法，如當局未能核准，則五日繼續停秤。此事已引起社會一致注意。</p>
<h3>採用結匯證明書辦法後　猪鬃業條陳意見</h3>
<p>自外匯政策結滙證明書辦法實施後，輸出業之困難仍未盡解除。上海猪鬃輸出業聯誼會昨特分呈輸管會及國行請求補救，關於困難方面，該業指出</p>
<p>（一）結匯證明書限期太短，需求不多，未能順利出售。且售價逐日减低，而黑市匯價依然存在，僅於暫時回跌後又復暴漲，超出牌價與證明書價之總數仍在三分之一以上。至出口物資在國內價格，本已超出國外售價甚多，自新辦法公佈後，產地各貨無不飛漲，使成本格外加高，無法划合。蓋貨價跟隨黑市已久，如匯價不能與黑市接近，則出口永無推動之望。</p>
<p>（二）產地貨價上漲後，輸出商需要之頭寸更大，而指定銀行打包借款仍按牌價七折貸給，合之產地貨價，僅及三成，輸出商須塾七成，在此物價高銀根緊之雙重壓迫下，何來如此巨大力量，繼續在產地購貨，勢非大加緊縮，或陷于停頓不可。</p>
<p>（三）在機動匯率政策下，輸出商在進貨時雖不能划合成本，而在出售時尙可按照當時牌價大約計算，而決定其裝船與結匯之早遲，以求勉敷成本。現在牌價仍可隨時更動，而證明書售價又非事前可知，有此雙重未知數，即使貨物已裝船，且無從預計其所得。例如某批貨品準備裝船，先照牌價結匯，而在證明書未售出時，牌價又復掛高，因之證明書市價從而回跌，則該批貨物所受意外損失之默大不難想像，輸出商須冒此兩重風險，業務更難進展。</p>
<p>關於希望改善者</p>
<p>一，結滙證明書有效期間，僅限七日，時機迫促，對象難求，尤其在新辦法開始實施之際。進口商已有許可證不多。指定銀行之手續未備，供需之狀况未明，市價之標準未定，各方均在觀望中。此時縱有成交，亦極少數，決非公平而合理之價格，以致與圈外市價相距懸殊。該會會員等為表示擁護新政策，及為維持國外信用如期裝船起見，在辦法公布日，即已踴躍結匯，為數頗多。證明書轉瞬滿期，迄今無法售出，應請在供求未臻平衡，市價未能由指定銀行逐日決定，且隨時收買前，暫行展限為一個月，以後再視事實需要，決定適宣限期。</p>
<p>二，新辦法之主旨，旣在於使結滙證明書之售價，在市塲上自求水準，以達到適合實際之價格，似應讓其充分自然發展，而不應再用人為的操縱，將平衡會牌價隨時更動，致仍蹈未改革前之覆轍，而失去新辦法之精神，且有雙重匯價，更足加深物價之刺激，加重輸出商之風險。此層應請明白公布，以安人心。</p>
<p>三，打包借款，應請通函各指定銀行改照牌價與證明書大約代價之總數，按七折貸放，仍由中央銀行予以重貼現，其期限擬請規定為兩個月，以便轍出商有充足時間與財力，在產地搜購物資。</p>

<h3>兩項接力緊張精彩</h3>
<p>昨日最緊張之項目，仍為大學組之二項接力賽，男子組一千六百米接力，第一棒約翰蔣維良一馬當先，超出餘子達三公尺，第二棒滬江徐祖瑗逐漸趕上，第三棒孫家雯再接再厲，保持第一，交大王南村亦追成第二，最後一棒，滬江四百米冠軍楊永芳，絕塵而她，以三分五十三秒六刷新由該校保持之紀錄。約翰則賴會爾　最後一棒之努力，於最後二十公尺內，竄越交大劉振中，奪得亞軍，第三交大，第四同濟。</p>
<p>大學女組四百米接力，約翰滬江兩校，俱各傾全力以赴，競爭之劇烈，不下於前日男子賽，約翰仍賴最後衝刺，以一肩壓倒滬江。第一棒約翰李家喬，滬江吳安慶，與大夏張桂　並騎連轡，同時跑畢。滬江平素練習較多，接棒純熟，處秉彝即賴此棒超出約翰關使仙少許。第三棒約翰馮普政追成平手，與滬江曾超羣同時到達。最後一棒，滬江又以接棒較熱領前，李淼亡命苦追，無奈王珊亦非弱者，相持至最後十米，李淼始賴其超人長力，與王珊並肩而馳。至終點時，李淼奮力一躍，以半步之微奪得錦標，成績為一分一秒二，打破滬江所創一分二秒九之大專紀錄。</p>

<p>啦啦隊昨日大出動，除了約翰滬江之外，尙有立信一枝新軍，約翰啦啦隊還邀得化學系助敎領隊，生色不少。</p>
<p>啦啦口號最為觀衆欣賞者是「流水詞」：上山流水歇里里，下山流水豁拉拉，歇里里，豁拉拉，××××頂括括！女子跳欄前輩錢行素女士，昨亦在塲觀賽，上屆全運走紅的健兒、，如今是曁大與體專的敎師。</p>
<p>交大長跑健兒王南村，係七屆全運火炬長跑最後一棒抵達會塲者，昨日五千米決賽，王跑最後一圈時，掌聲四起，王勇氣百倍，其受觀衆之歡迎，不亞於啞子樓文敖。</p>
<p>啦啦隊約翰滬江立信三校，最初競爭甚烈，將近閉幕時，化敵為友，互相捧塲，約翰先呌：「滬江好，滬江妙，滬江滬江刮刮呌。」立信也呌：「約翰好，立信好，大家好！」</p>
<p>滬江四三四號女運動員，被約翰滬江兩校同學譽為大會之花，與五七號男運動員寸步不離，故後者亦膺「大會王子」之雅號</p>
<p>個人方面，洋力士鮑萊仍膺三鐵冠軍，自大專運動會創始以來，三鐵錦標，即被鮑萊視為禁　，未嘗一容他人染指，亦屬難得。</p>
<p>交大王南村連得八百米，千五百米，與五千米三項中距離冠軍，取上屆滬江林燦然而代之，與鮑萊同列第一。互相媲美。（暢鑫）</p>

<p>約大學生舉動表示尤為可憾</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕敎部杭次長立武，五日晨在南京金陵大學校董會議中致辭，略云：「本人願借此機會，一述近年來不正常的反美醞釀。此事殊欠正常理由，並有損中美之友誼。反美者的藉口，係為美國對日政策過份寬厚，足以促成一個工業化的日本，而為中國及世界和平之成脅。此點並不正確，因為整個賠償問題，以及日本將被允許工業化之程序，均尙在遠東委會愼重考慮中。即所謂德萊普與聖翰笙報吿書，也並非美國政府正式接受之文件。其次，吾人必須謹記我國對日之旣定雙面政策，即一而嚴防一個讀武與侵略的日本之再起，而同時則採取一寬容而具有遠見之政策，允許日本和平地生活和貿易。吾人相信，此亦為其他聯合國所採取之共同政策，包括美國在內。美國目前在日本之措施，與其在歐洲及遠東所推行之政策，完全一致，即援助受戰爭損害之國家，使能復興自助。除非吾人願採取報復主義，迫使日本人民挺而走險，當不致反對此項政策。鑒於中美兩國人民悠遠而誠摯的傳統友誼，對於主要係因煽動而發生之反美情緒，如任其以此種藉口助長蔓延，實堪痛惜，尤其發生於敎會所設之聖約翰大學，更為可憾。且中美文化之關係與美國對於中國敎育之貢獻，向為兩國親善之源泉。中國政府與人民對於美國之合作及協助深為感謝，當不容中美關係為不負責任之行動所損害。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京五日電〕敎育部次長杭立武，今日向金陵大學校董會致詞稱；反美情緒，竟波及敎會學校，如上海聖約翰大學者，尤屬可憾。據消息靈通者稱：杭氏此項演說，實得王外長同意而發。</p>

<h3>溫肇桐：藝術教育的新課題</h3>
<p>為中華藝術教育社年會作</p>
<p>歷史吿訴我們，藝術敎育並不是什麼新鮮的玩意兒。「周尙文，禮樂備四代之制，聲敎文物，號稱鼎盛。」在西洋，柏拉圖的藝術敎育思想，遠在二千數百年前的時代，已風行一時了。</p>
<p>然而，在二十世紀，在原子時代的今日，在咱們具有悠久藝術敎育的歷史傳統的中國，為什麽還要提倡藝術敎育，改進藝術敎育？</p>
<p>理由當然節單，因為，今日的中國，大家太不重視藝術敎育，而且是窒息藝術敎育，我們不妨看一看下面的許多事實：</p>
<p>大家都覺得頭痛的「連環圖畫」，是非禁止不可的，非改良不可的，政府三令五申，然而它還是逍遙法外。最近本市市校敎師福利會敎硏工作展中，曾有如此驚人的梳計與分析吿訴大家：</p>
<p>（一）「連環岡畫」自民國五年開始發行，現已銷遍全國及南洋各地。</p>
<p>（二）估計本市有出租攤一千個，每攤每天平均有八十個讀者，一天共有八萬，每人以租費五千元計，則每天總消耗於「連環圖畫」者為四萬萬元。</p>
<p>（三）它的內容：人物是：鬼神妖怪，巫卜風相，武士俠客，土豪惡霸。形式是：不通的文字，歪曲的記載，醜惡的畫面。思想是：鬼神賞罰，大公無私，尋得好風水，子孫必大發。</p>
<p>請再看學校裏頭：美術課，勞作課，大多是敎兒童摹擬成人，模倣成法，有的學校紫性把這些點輟性質的科目取消，英國算是可以升學的。</p>
<p>留心藝術師資的人，誰都說師資缺乏。於是訓練藝術師資，便當作會議席上的必要提案。但如何訓練？訓練成什麼樣子？還少有人計及。而且現成的藝術師資，不是正在改行？不是在鬧失業嗎？</p>
<p>像上面許多錯誤，矛盾的現象太多了，眞是不勝枚舉。我們是藝術敎育者，我們多想糾正這些錯誤，消滅這些矛盾。這其實好像目前的「掃除文盲」，這邊剛剛在掃，那邊文盲是又來了。</p>
<p>我不是消極，我們老是着眼於傳統的藝術敎育，藝術敎育本身是不會向上發展的。可以說，連上述的錯誤，矛盾的惡勢力也抵敵不過。不要說要糾正，消滅，而且相反地在維持它的生存。</p>
<p>因為大多數的藝術敎育工作者’還憧憬於士大夫階級的藝術觀與敎育觀。這是傳統的思想在作祟，也是傳統的舊社會所必有的意識反映，與「連環圖畫」「模仿敎育」「升學敎育」正是一丘之貉，在本質上是統一的</p>
<p>今日中國藝術敎育的新課題，是藝術敎育工作者本身意識的需要改造，應該從速接受現實主義美學思想與民主主義敎育哲學的指導，進而改造藝術敎育的本質，以藝術敎育的力量推動社會進步，當我國脫去了外來與自身的重重束縛，自由獨立地站在世界之上，這時候藝術敎育一定有更廣，更深，更合理的力量表現出來。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>想起「傳曼殊」</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>傅曼殊博士，身裁極高，消瘦異常，面色蒼白，手指織細，指甲長達寸許，兩眼有綠色光芒，有雅片烟癮，智力極端豐富，舉止神秘莫測，專喜探聽隱私，羽黨遍於全球，常做殺人越　的勾當……還有一點：他是中國人！</p>
<p>不過，他並不存在。他不過是一位美國偵探小說家洛默（Sax　Rohrner）筆下的人物罷了。他的名字應該是Fu　Manchu，「傅曼殊」是我替他起的譯名。</p>
<p>洛默的「神怪恐怖似探小說」（仿電影院廣吿的說法）刊行者已有幾十種，銷路極廣，儼然在最走紅的偵探小說之列。而每一部小說的主角總是這位無惡不作的瘋狂「學者」：傅曼殊。最近自從五月八日起，美國的柯里安週刊又開始通載了一篇「傅曼殊小說」。傅曼殊簡直有長生不老的趨勢。</p>
<p>我看過了兩三百部英美人作的偵探小說，每逢看到傅受殊，總覺滿身難受，勞髴在炎夏過四川路橋時聞到了蘇州河那一彎臭水，實在想吐。但是，我想我們也還應當反省一下。</p>
<p>傅曼殊代表了什麽東西？他卑鄙，陰刁，貪婪，殘忍。如果我們多讀一點歐美人的著作，恐怕至今還能在字裏行間找出許多對中國人懷有戒心的痕跡罷？唐人街永遠是神秘的，因為中國本身便是不可思議的；所以他們常用Inscrutable這個字來形容中國。至於傅曼殊之智力過人，手段高强，却又象徵了外國人對中國這幾千年文明的一種觀感，其意若曰：「他們眞了不得——不過我總還是莫名其妙。」</p>
<p>平心而論，我想創造出「傅曼殊」來的洛默倒未必存心要把中國人描寫成這樣一個可怕的人物。我想，洛默不過是一個平平常常的普通的美國人，也許他偶然看見過幾張中國的仕女畫（那指甲是多麽長啊！），想在小說裏加一點異國情調進去，同時又看見過幾本講義和團的書，於是長指甲也有了，畫符揑訣也有了，移山倒海也有了，力槍不入也有了——再加上一個表示敬意（？）的「達克透一，於是傅孟殊博士出世。</p>
<p>他未必有對中國人「不敬」的意思，正像黃佐臨寫「假鳳虛凰」時未必想到竟會得罪了全國理髮師。不過，壞就壞在「傅曼殊小說」的銷路甚廣，普遍深入到了許多和洛默差不多的普通美國人民的手裏—其結果，恐怕是未必會對中國有什麼好處的；就如好萊塢把大盜傑斯·詹姆士和狄林傑之類攝成的電影，在中國也未必會造成好印象一樣。</p>
<p>如果中美二國要談合作，那麽首先必須求得二國老百姓之間的相互的瞭解。這責任是相互的，我們也應當負起責任來，吿訴人家，中國目前雖非天堂，倒底小脚和辮子業已絕跡，而且中國的老年人也未必都喜歡留八字鬍鬚，更決不聽任八字鬍鬚無限制的一直向左右擴展，變成了兩撇鼠鬚。中國人儘管講究少年老成，究竟也不至於每一個人都心懷叵測。總而言之，「傅曼殊」可以「死」矣！</p>
<p>看到「假鳳虛凰」出國，尤其是這部片子已經配上了英語說白的消息，心裏甚為高興。這才是中國，這才是中國人呀！你看，石揮不是很幽默嗎？李麗華不是很漂亮嗎？中國人何嘗神秘呢？那裏有什麽要命的「傳曼殊」的影子？</p>
<p>不過，話又說回來。如果有一位在上海的美國朋友指指跑馬廳的石翁仲問我：「你說中國人並不神秘，很對很對。我祗想請問你：那一對石頭人是幾時成了仙的？」可呌我怎麽回答呢！</p>
<h3>烹</h3>
<p>— 石文</p>
<p>英王亨利八世在位的時候，國內有一個牧師，雇用了一個名叫李　·魯斯的廚子。不想魯斯人面獸心，竟把牧師的家屬毒死了兩個。亨利八世聽見了此事大發雷霆，因為廚子是善於烹調的，便下旨造大鍋一隻，高高掛起，下面擺了一大堆火光熊熊的木柴。他命令把魯斯放在鍋子裏大「烹」一下，叫他活活燒死。據歷史記載，那個廚子在鍋子裏慘呼了足足一個鐘頭，死時全身皮膚通紅，髮髴像是一只大明蝦云。</p>
<h3>鐵肺人醫院</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>說起鐵肺人，國人就想起戰前在北平突然沾染小兒麻痺症的佛拉德·史奈特。史奈特不過是鐵肺人之一，世界各地散居着不少其他的鐵肺人，而鐵肺人的集中地則在美國巴鐵麽爾城兒童醫學院新設立的「呼吸器中心站」。這裏有九個成人和十幾歲的孩子個別的躺在鐵肺中，藉鐵肺的脈動支持他們的呼吸和生命。</p>
<p>他們比獨居的鐵肺人有一點好處：就是不孤寂。他們成了一個團體，互相鼓勵，互相安慰，互相作伴。他們培養出信心，對脫離鐵肺雖似遙遙無期，但終非絕無希望。</p>
<p>鐵肺人是小兒麻痺症的最慘的犧牲者，並且最難治療。這一類病人常是呼吸器管肌肉，和手脚同樣的被麻痺了。他們必須平躺仰臥在一架龐大的鐵的機器裏。空氣壓到這架機器的內部，代替衰弱的肌肉行呼吸工作。鐵肺人眞正失去了行動的自由，他們的視界也受到限制，祗能看到鐵肺上懸在他們眼睛前面的鏡子所反映出來的景物。</p>
<p>「呼吸器中心站」是由瑪麗蘭州牧師會的「小兒麻痺症國家基金會」在一九四六年六月創辦的，由喬治·班納德博士監督管理。它的目的是兩方面的：第一，鐵肺人需要一天二十四小時的照料，九個人合居在一起比獨居更經濟，並且能使他們在心理上不產生孤獨的悲哀；第二，這樣便於作完全的臨牀實騐—無論是在醫學方而或心理方面。</p>
<h3>再談煙墨</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>自來制墨之法，常取烟煤，或松脂，雜沈水蘇合香，投萆麻桐油，麋角為膠，臼杵萬搗，融成為丸。或為餅為錠，以模範之，堅硬如石，磨之色黑而有光者為佳。千古稱絕者，惟徐鉉月團，唐玄宗龍香，李廷珪龍紋雙脊三種而已。</p>
<p>現在新墨出產，以徵州為最，如胡開文曹素功詹大有等，所用原料烟煤，皆購自海外，大抵屬於工廠中烟筩之積灰，質粗重而色淡，膠亦不如從前所用之佳，墨面所稱頂烟，或五百斤油，均不實在也。以此欲求製法之不退化，難矣。書畫家不取新墨，而求古墨，亦由於此。</p>
<p>余見故宮陳列所，陳列李廷珪墨一種，其墨匣上刻有淸高宗所製「墨雲室記」，內稱「畢沅進古墨一方，長盈尺，博二寸，厚十分寸之二，匣刻晁氏記，以為僧法一所藏，南唐李廷珪之物。」又有董蔗林所書之古墨歌云：「墨玉一方長尺計，玉堅自是墨為脆，具玉之堅墨之良，希珍覩此廷珪製。五代至今將千年，法一所藏晁氏記，其形　款及其　，次第　詞記詳細。翰林風月辨依稀，遍體濃雲釀雨意，今春甘澤利農功，回氐有靈佑佳端。炎劉韋誕徒傳名，魏丸晉螺誰則識，東坡茶墨曾品論；德操胥同譬良士。橡匣錦囊重弄藏，龍賓那忍　妃試，旣而自惕且自笑；旅獒玩物稱德累，寳賢不用寳何為，絜矩過存增慚愧。」此為淸高宗首唱之詩。記中曾云：「命諸臣各以已意和之，不必拘體賡韻，亦西淸一段佳話也」之語，其墨堅繳如玉，紋如犀角，據云用藤黃犀角眞珠巴豆等十二品調合製成，信為　價之寳。</p>
<p>李廷玤墨，世未嘗絕其墨上印文作「邽」字者為上，作「圭」字者次之，作「珪」字者又次之，作「奚廷珪」三字者最下，廷珪本姓奚，後賜姓李，余前已述之，格古要論云：「李廷珪墨有二品，龍紋雙脊者為上，一脊者次之。」然已不多見，製法失傳一其他製墨者，均未能及。</p>
<p>州高深甫著「淸賞箋」，以四言論墨云：「墨之妙用，質取其輕，烟取其靑，嗅之無香，磨之無聲，新硯新水，磨若不勝。（言不可用力磨也。）忌急則熱，熱則抹生，用則旋硯，硯無久停，塵埃汚墨，膠力泥凝。用過則濯，墨積勿盈，藏久膠宿，墨用乃精。」此專言用墨，不言藏墨，用墨者與藏墨者宗旨不同，用者不必言藏，藏者不必言用，但藏而不用，何以知其墨之美，蓋美不在墨之外表也。但藏之太久，則磨用又紫然意盡，反不如存作玩物之為得矣。</p>
<p>凌霄漢閣滅有避暑山莊百景墨之三，乾隆羅漢墨五百尊之一，大抵均係淸代所造者。余舊藏有明代製之圓如玉玦者兩方，已失於倭寇之亂。行篋中惟存有淸代所製之心經墨一方，一面刻心經全篇，一而刻釋迦佛一尊，上書「本來面目」四篆字，旁記蘇必達所製，備寫經所用而已。以言收藏，興既未能至，力亦未能逮也。李廷珪精於製　，亦工於詩，人所不知。其詩有云：「贈爾烏玉玦，淸泉硯須潔，避暑懸葛囊，臨風度梅月。」則又非方于魯羅小華輩所能及矣。</p>
<h3>鬥黃島</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>本報載上海適存社在南市邑廟大鬥黃鳥，集合鳥數達九百頭，配成四百五十對，分組決鬥，觀者人山人海，極為熱鬧。讀此新聞者，或惜盛會當前，未曾往觀，或謂當此時局，不應有此。茲先就予所知，以談黃鳥。</p>
<p>此鳥求一善鬥之才，百中實難得一，此次九百頭鳥，不知經過幾多選擇，幾多淘汰，始克有此。聞選鳥之法，首須相鳥眼，次則相鳥毛，後則相鳥身。眼明者，臨陣不亂，發無不中，而又善於禦敵，使敵無隙可乘，俗謂「將軍一雙眼，敵人驚破胆」是也。毛硬者，雖受重創，仍能愈戰愈勇，終必獲勝。身强大者，則力足勢雄，定能耐戰。補鳥之法，冬月則設網以羅之，此鳥隆冬皆低飛，集於叢棘，張網附近，更驚鳥使起，飛投網中，即可成擒。春時則多高飛，宜以籠誘之。籠懸樹陰，內開多門，門設機栝，籠之中則閉置一鳥，以資誘引；羣鳥被誘，即飛投籠門，一蹈機栝，門即隨閉，欲出不能。惟遇佳鳥，則其來係為尋鬥，聲勢汹汹，趨啄籠中之鳥，故籠鳥必須愼選，懦弱之鳥，恒被來鳥嚇退，噤不敢聲，甚則驚極在籠中狂飛，即不能誘佳鳥入籠。必須可資一鬥者，方不為來鳥所遏，而能誘佳鳥，但又不可以善鬥之老鳥充之，因其戰鬥力强，尋鬥勢盛，來鳥皆懼而不敢入，且畜鳥者均不欲以佳鳥置諸誘鳥之籠，因此籠最易壞鳥也。至鳥之鬥法，約而言之，不外頭與脚二者。何謂頭？即善啄敵方之頭。當兩鳥接近，雙方互啄，亦雙方互避，其眼明嘴快老，每啄恒着敵頭，且令脫毛流血，而於敵方反啄，則能巧以避之，使其撲空，待至敵鳥屢被痛啄，心神慌亂，輙乘機疾進，伸入兩脚，將敵鳥之頭緊抱，斯時敵鳥已被擒住，掙脫不能，而頭又在其喙下，任其儘啄，頭毛盡去，血肉狼藉，甚至眼瞎頸殘，惟有哀鳴逃脫。此項鬥法，俗名「抱頭開」，非眼明身捷力厚者，不克臻此。何謂脚？即專取敵脚致勝。蹈罅伺隙，即將敵脚疾拖過絲，敵脚被拖，頭身即仰翻於後，無法前啄，甚者趁勢再拖，將身及爪全踞敵脚之上，斯時敵脚全被捉住，奮身掙脫，亦不可能，一任將脚啄開，皮肉盡脫，其受創過劇者，幾不能站身籠架，每每墮於籠底。此項鬥法，係以巧取勝，面眼明爪快，亦其特長。大抵長於頭者難免創於脚，長於脚者難免敗於頭，善鬥之雄，遇勁敵亦難必勝。常勝之將，每因老而遭挫敗，且有素稱善戰，忽然遇敵即潰者，此則於畜養之術有關，致具有病而不能知，故鳥之勝負，於鳥體肥瘠，飼養良否，關係亦巨焉。</p>
<h3>近詩二律</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>中夜自報館歸</p>
<p>舊簡新編入晚拈，筆耕心織恐徵　，鐙明古壁靑垂眼，鏡怯衰容白到髯，醉後狂言如有得，閒來除睡更無甜，歸途中夜江山靜，百尺樓頭月一簾。</p>
<p>關外鏖戰有感</p>
<p>車軌書文未盡同，乾坤俯仰　由衷？近來髮又數衆白，老去顏惟杯酒紅。關塞興師經眼雨，江山無檄愈頭風，愁懷欲起王維問。底處歡　不戰功？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>「黃金世界」一黃金時代一兩詞，皆表微極大之繁昌，一就空間言，一就時間言。黃金之貴，古今中外不約而同，實因其質性具有貨幣之最高價値。然中國舊時，即近如前淸，亦尙以銅錢為通貨；至於銀，惟大宗官項，貴重貨品，特別用項，以銀計値。（硃砂痣之韓公對吳生說：「世界以上，銀子是好物件，好寶貝。」誠八方同慨。）然銀固非幣，其形非圓錠即散塊，用時輒須勞動衡器，而衡器又有種種不同，麻煩不堪。（王堂春劇中，蘇三供稱，黑夜之間，無有天平戥秤，用手一稱，不過三百兩。幸是贈人，若買物則非過秤不可。）銀元乃淸代中晚之舶來物，由華南與用，故後來中國造者亦通稱「洋錢」，銀乃為幣矣。又蘇三述王公子初次進院帶銀三百兩，吃杯香茶就走，使堂上官驚其慷慨大方。蘇三又供二次帶銀三萬六千，不及一年俱已花盡，使堂上官大驚，詰問「難道吃銀子穿銀子不成？」於是蘇三開報其支銷，金盆玉椀，什錦花園，萬花亭子，許多工程，皆足以表現三萬餘銀之豪奢的威力。銀尙如此，何况乎金！得意綠劇中之盧生說「男兒膝下有黃金，」又笑說「兩條腿是金子打的，」雖皆戲詞，亦足反映彼時之金，只是一種標準的貴物，若實用，比銀更希，即「天平戥秤」亦少驚動。馬鞍山劇兪伯牙以貴官贈卹鍾子期之老父，用「黃金二笏」，戯文中偶見之。</p>
<p>古時黃金曰「幾笏」（與古墨同），亦曰「錠」，今則動曰「幾條」（每條十兩），與香烟同。香烟每條十盒，每盒二十支，此亦勝利以來美式風氣。從前香烟十支為多，廿支亦偶有之，大盒則五百支為一整盒，二百五十支為半盒，今則條之外，即大箱矣。香烟之條，比昔之盒似較便利。黃金之條，比昔之「笏」或「大錠」亦似乎Modern些。此尙無關宏旨，惟許多交易及出入，以及奸官之發橫財，奸商之營黑市，動輒幾條幾十條（或根），則為Modern風氣，更屬顯然。蓋舊式之拜金與新式之「揮金」合而為一，乃成為「條子」「根子」的社會之畸形病態。</p>

        <h1>1948.06.06</h1>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Shijie Issues Statement: China's Policy Towards Japan is Consistent, Ensuring the Prevention of the Revival of Militarism is Guaranteed. The General Populace Holds No Anti-American Sentiment</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the 5th regarding Japan's industrial level and related reparations issues:</p>
<p>(1) Allied Basic Policy on Japan's Industrial Level and Reparations: The basic policy of the Allied Powers regarding Japan's industrial level and reparations was established by the Potsdam Declaration of July 25, 1945. Article 11 of that declaration states:</p>
<p>"Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, raw materials shall be allowed entry into Japan, but control over raw materials shall be eliminated. Japan shall be permitted eventually to participate in world trade relations." This declaration was jointly decided by the leaders of the governments of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and later agreed to by the leader of the Soviet government. It was announced to the Japanese people before Japan's surrender and constitutes a mutual constraint among the Allied powers.</p>
<p>(2) US Report: After Japan's surrender, the US government sent an investigation team led by Pauley to Japan and various parts of the Far East in 1946. Based on the report submitted by Pauley, commonly referred to as the Pauley Report, all Japanese military factories and most ordinary factories that could be converted for military use should be dismantled and removed. In 1947 and 1948, the US government sent investigation teams led by Strike and Draper to Japan, respectively. The reports are commonly referred to as the Strike Report and the Draper (or Johnston) Report. Both of these reports advocated that Japan should retain more factories than suggested in the Pauley Report.</p>
<p>(3) Current Discussions by the Far Eastern Commission: After the Pauley Report was submitted, the US government submitted a plan for the dismantling of Japanese factories to the Far Eastern Commission in April 1947. The current discussions in the commission are actually based on the investigation of the Pauley Report. The countries attending the Far Eastern Commission have not yet reached an agreement on the scope of Japanese industrial retention. If a decision is made, according to the organizational regulations of the Far Eastern Commission, the unanimous agreement of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union is required. Before the four countries reach a final agreement, the US government has agreed to a preliminary dismantling plan so that the four countries that have suffered the most deeply, namely China, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, can receive partial reparations first. China should receive half of the factories dismantled under this preliminary plan. As for the US government's attitude towards the Strike Report and the Draper (or Johnston) Report, we have not yet received any official indication from the US government.</p>
<p>(4) China's Policy: Regarding this issue, China's policy has been clearly stated repeatedly and has been consistent throughout. We support and endorse the principles of the Potsdam Declaration. We must have a definite guarantee against the revival of Japanese militarism. At the same time, we recognize that Japan must gradually become self-sufficient in terms of ordinary economic life. In his inaugural address on May 20 of this year, President Chiang stated that China does not adopt a policy of revenge towards Japan. The Japanese people should be able to rebuild their economy within the scope set by the Allied powers to secure their livelihood. In his foreign affairs report to the National Assembly on April 14 of this year, he also stated, "The future peace treaty with Japan must guarantee that Japan cannot commit aggression again. In the economic aspect, we do not oppose making the Japanese people self-sufficient. Our goal is to foster the birth of a new and democratic Japan, neither allowing it to embark on the path of a revived militarism nor allowing it to embark on the path of communism."</p>
<p>Preventing Japan from re-invading and giving the Japanese people a chance to be self-sufficient—how to reconcile these two demands is indeed a task that requires careful consideration and may cause disputes among the governments concerned. The Chinese government and the US government often have different opinions on whether certain Japanese factories should be dismantled. However, I firmly believe that neither the Chinese government nor the US government has any intention of allowing Japan to re-arm. Such connivance is unimaginable for a government that resisted Japanese aggression for as long as thirteen years, and it is also unimaginable for the US government, which has the painful experience of Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>I also firmly believe that even if some people in the country have concerns or misunderstandings about this matter, the general Chinese populace holds no anti-American sentiment, because this country was our like-minded friend in the last World War, and in the future, we must also cooperate with each other to establish world peace.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Wang Yunwu Assumes Office: Future Policies Will Still Focus on Increasing Revenue and Reducing Expenditure, Planning New Taxes and Rectifying Tax Collection</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The new Finance Minister, Wang Yunwu, arrived at the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 5th to assume office. Former Minister Yu Hongjun introduced him and addressed the ministry's staff. Yu first praised Wang for succeeding him as Finance Minister, saying that Wang is fair and honest, and puts the country first in his work, and he believed that he would definitely take effective measures to save the economic crisis in the future. He then encouraged all colleagues to cooperate effectively with Minister Wang. Wang then stood up amid applause and said that at the most difficult time for the country, he was taking on the most difficult task. Many outsiders thought that he was ignorant of the facts or overestimated his abilities, but he did not think so. He had spent several days gaining a clear understanding of the total expenditure and the maximum possible total revenue for the second half of this year. As for whether he "overestimated his abilities," he also had self-knowledge. For a year, he had participated in the National Economic Council and the Budget Review Committee, and had gained an understanding of the financial and economic situation. At this difficult time for the country's finances and economy, he would do his best to improve the situation based on his understanding. He hoped that his colleagues would cooperate with him and work together to complete the mission. Finally, he explained his policy direction, saying that at this time of national financial difficulties, with huge military and public expenditures, the Ministry of Finance's policy would still focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Expenditure reduction should start from the Ministry of Finance itself, while revenue increase is the Ministry of Finance's undeniable responsibility. This should start with opening up new tax sources and rectifying tax collection. The first step in opening up new tax sources is to increase new taxes. Although this cannot be effective in the short term, new taxes that the people think should be implemented, and that comply with the principle of those with money paying money, must be implemented. In terms of rectifying tax collection, the tax rate should be adapted to prices. In the future, supervision will also be strengthened to ensure that every penny of tax revenue collected by tax collection agencies is turned over to the public treasury. Wang talked about future financial and foreign exchange policies, saying that the financial control policy is generally good, and will continue to be implemented effectively in the future. Foreign exchange policy has improved since Mr. Yu became the Governor of the Central Bank. In the future, he hopes that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank will cooperate and jointly be responsible for striving for the perfection of the foreign exchange policy. Finally, Wang also encouraged all his colleagues to do more and talk less, and to work hard to ensure that the financial and economic situation is substantially improved in order to overcome the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu went to the ministry to work both in the morning and afternoon of the 5th, and met individually with Vice Ministers of Finance Xu Baiyuan and Li Dang and senior ministry officials to inquire about the ministry's work situation. He also announced the appointment of Xu Baiqi as Chief Secretary, Wu Zhuangjun as Director of the General Affairs Department, and Zhao Guan as Senior Secretary. Most other personnel changes were not made. Yang Mianzhong, Director of the National Treasury Department, and Zai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department, requested to resign, which was approved by Yu Hongjun. Candidates for their successors are still being sought. It is rumored that Chen Pingcheng has been internally appointed as Director of the Currency Issuance Department. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, had requested to resign earlier, and Wang Yunwu is currently trying to persuade him to stay. It is also learned that Yu Hongjun returned to Shanghai by night train on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, previously concurrently held by Yu Hongjun, has now been taken over by Wang Yunwu after Yu was transferred to be the Governor of the Central Bank. Liang Jingchun, who also served as Chief Secretary of the Bureau, had requested to resign, but Wang Yunwu persuaded him to stay. However, Liang's position as Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance has been resigned and approved, and he has been transferred to be a Counselor of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Thailand Closes Overseas Chinese Schools, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Others Discuss Countermeasures, Continuing to Actively Negotiate Through Diplomatic Channels</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Thai government has closed our overseas Chinese schools. Our authorities have lodged protests through diplomatic channels, but no satisfactory results have been achieved. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission specially invited eight units from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant agencies to discuss countermeasures at the commission on the afternoon of the 5th. As a result, it was considered that diplomatic channels should still be used to actively negotiate, urging the Thai government to fulfill the provisions of the treaty and abolish the new regulations restricting overseas Chinese schools in order to maintain the traditional friendship between China and Thailand.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 5th] The Thai Ministry of Education today proposed a compromise solution to the closure of 500 overseas Chinese schools in the country, advocating that the closed schools should first comply with the law and reopen, and then request to amend the law.</p>
<h3>Our New Ambassador to Thailand, Xie Baojiao, Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 4th] Our new Ambassador to Thailand, Xie Baojiao, presented his credentials to the Chairman of the Regency Council at the Sutthai Palace at 11:00 AM on the 4th.</p>
<h3>Lapham Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow, Will Go to Guangzhou to Inspect the Yuehan Railway Project, Weng Wenhao Will Concurrently Serve as Chairman of the US Aid Application Committee</h3>

Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, and the Directors of the Engineering, Mechanical, and Transportation Departments will come to Guangzhou on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] It is learned that after the amendment of the organizational law of the Executive Yuan's US Aid Application Committee, one Deputy Chairman has been added. It has been internally decided that this position will be concurrently held by Yu Hongjun. The Chairman will still be concurrently held by Weng Wenhao, the President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Constitutional Control Yuan Officially Convenes, President Chiang Personally Delivers Speech, Tomorrow's First Preparatory Meeting Will Elect the President</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The first Constitutional Control Yuan officially convened. The opening ceremony was solemnly held in the auditorium of the Lizhi Society at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th. 115 members of the Control Yuan attended. President Chiang, wearing a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, accompanied by Liu Zhe, arrived. Vice President Li and government leaders Weng Wenhao, Zhou Zhongyue, He Yingqin, Wang Shijie, Guan Jiyu, Gui Yongqing, etc., and foreign guests from France, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, and India, attended the ceremony. The opening ceremony was presided over by Li Mengbiao, a 70-year-old member of the Control Yuan from Shaanxi, who delivered a speech, explaining that the Control Yuan has a heavy responsibility after the implementation of the Constitution. The members of this session of the Control Yuan should faithfully exercise their powers under the Constitution, display a fair demeanor, and vigorously implement impeachment and censure. Then President Chiang was invited to deliver a speech, starting at 10:12 AM, encouraging this session of the Control Yuan to continue the unfinished work of the past and complete the mission of constitutional governance. It lasted for five minutes and then music was played to complete the ceremony.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The first Control Yuan produced under the Constitution convened on the 5th. The Control Yuan Organization Law, which was promulgated on March 31 last year and amended on December 25 of the same year and April 3 of the 37th year of the Republic of China, was also issued by the President on the 5th, and implemented from the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] After the opening of the Constitutional Control Yuan, all members of the Control Yuan are scheduled to pay respects to the Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 6th. The first preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 7th. The meeting will first elect the temporary chairman and temporary secretary-general. After the preparatory committee reports on the preparations, the following proposals will be discussed: (1) The seating arrangement of the Control Yuan members; (2) The formulation of the method for the Control Yuan members to elect the President and Vice President; (3) The formulation of the voting and ballot counting methods and election procedures for the Control Yuan members to elect the President and Vice President. Regarding the mutual election method, the preparatory committee has drafted a draft for reference by the preparatory meeting. The method stipulates that all members of the Control Yuan are natural candidates, and stipulates that the election must be held with the attendance of more than half of the total number of members of the Control Yuan, and that the candidate who receives more than half of the number of attendees is elected. However, if no candidate receives more than half of the votes in the first round, the top three candidates will be voted on a second time. If no candidate receives more than half of the votes again, the top two candidates will be voted on a third time. In the third round of voting, the candidate with the most votes will be elected. [Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee had decided to recommend Yu Youren for the President of the Control Yuan. President Chiang also expressed this intention to the Kuomintang members of the Control Yuan on the 5th in his capacity as Director-General of the Kuomintang, and explained at the same time that he hoped to recommend Liu Zhe as the Vice President. President Chiang invited Kuomintang members of the Control Yuan to a tea party at the Lizhi Society at 5:00 PM on the 5th, and Yu Youren and Liu Zhe were also invited to attend. President Chiang immediately expressed that the party comrades should support Yu and Liu. Some members of the Control Yuan expressed opposition to the idea that since the President of the Legislative Yuan is from the South, the President of the Control Yuan should be from the North, but most expressed support for the candidates proposed by the Director-General. Liu Zhe immediately expressed his gratitude to the members of the Control Yuan. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Says He Largely Agrees With Ambassador Stuart's Statement, Japan Can No Longer Become an Aggressor</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Correspondent, 5th] Hu Shi expressed general agreement with Ambassador Stuart's statement. After reading the full text of the statement, he said: "Many of the things in it are things I have said before. My opinion is almost the same as his." When Hu met with reporters this afternoon, he picked up a wastebasket from the corner of his desk with one hand, pointed to it with the other, and said: "There are many letters to me from various places in here. I have been scolded a lot for the US policy toward Japan." But he finally explained the following opinions: First, the United States or any Allied power will not allow Japan to re-arm and restore its ability to aggress. There are many rumors in society. In fact, Japan's navy, air force, even civil aviation, army, and colonies are all gone. Under such circumstances, Japan can no longer become an aggressor. At the same time, the Allies are also unanimous in their opinion on stripping Japan of its aggressive power. Second, the so-called US support for Germany and Japan is actually to restore the production of peaceful industries with their industrial productivity and feed themselves. This enables 150 million people to live a peaceful and minimally decent life. Some people can't help but be jealous. Two years after the war, they have not yet reached a peaceful and safe life, let alone restored prosperity. Seeing that others have recovered faster than us, they feel unfair. Most of the legitimate criticism and fear comes from this. It may not necessarily be completely effective. Some people in industry also feel threatened, such as the British, Indian, and Chinese textile industries, which are all worried. However, going beyond legitimate concerns and talking about the United States retaining industries for wartime enemies is wrong. We are a country that is being supported. If you take support as support for aggressive power, wouldn't that be a big mistake? Hu Shi explained that Japan's recovery is faster because it is under the unified management of MacArthur, rather than the quadripartite division of Berlin and the north-south division of Korea. Because Japan's recovery is fast and China's recovery is slow, we can only worry about ourselves. To be fair, we can't hope that others will be as unlucky as ourselves just because we are unlucky, unprogressive, and unprosperous. So even if it is a legitimate concern, it is also a bit illegitimate. He also said that some people are taking the opportunity to incite anti-American sentiment.</p>
<p>Mei Yiqi Also Expresses Sympathy</p>
<p>And says some people are taking the opportunity to incite anti-American sentiment.</p>
<p>[Our Beijing Correspondent, 5th] Mei Yiqi largely sympathizes with Ambassador Stuart's statement. He believes that it is normal for the United States to support Japan so that its people can live independently, and that it is not intended to restore Japan's aggressive power. Japan has lost its old aggressive foundation. In the future peace conference, China should insist on the veto power, and should not allow Japan to restore the industrial level of the aggressive country after the September 18th Incident. Mei continued to say that those who are currently advocating opposition to the United States supporting Japan are partly because they are concerned about Japan's re-emergence, and it is also a fact that some people are taking the opportunity to incite anti-American sentiment. Stuart's way of making a statement instead of protesting to the Chinese government is correct.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the President's Speech, Encouraging the Full Effectiveness of the Five-Power System, Laying the Foundation for National Peace and Stability</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The following is the full text of President Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the first Control Yuan on the morning of the 5th:</p>
<p>The first Constitutional Control Yuan is convening as scheduled today, and I am very pleased. You gentlemen were elected by the provincial and municipal councils, as well as the local institutions of Mongolia and Tibet and overseas Chinese organizations. You are very clear about the people's livelihood and the pros and cons of politics. In the future, you will express your great opinions, gather ideas, and help improve politics and relieve the suffering of the people. You will definitely make great contributions to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the National Revolution, the purpose of which was to seek freedom and equality for China, and the method was to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, which is the specific outline of the Principle of Democracy and its essence. If we earnestly follow it, we can make the government virtuous and capable, and the politics clear. The independent exercise of the power of control is the basic difference between the Five Powers and the Three Powers. Therefore, the successful promotion of the power of control is also the success of the ideal of the Five-Power Constitution. From today onwards, you gentlemen have assumed the heavy responsibility of promoting the power of control. The Five-Power Constitution is the most excellent and progressive system, and it will be proven here.</p>
<p>From the Control Yuan of the Tutelage Period to the Constitutional Control Yuan, the legal nature is different, but the actual development process has its own consistency. The Control Yuan of the Tutelage Period was established in the twentieth year of the Republic of China. It has been 17 years since the day of the convocation of this Control Yuan. Initially, it only exercised the powers of impeachment and auditing, and it has already made many contributions. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to meet actual needs, the powers of censure and suggestion were added, and since their implementation, they have been even more effective. Based on past experience, the functions of the Control Yuan stipulated in the Constitution, in addition to changing "suggestion" to "correction" to strengthen effectiveness, also give it the power of consent so that it can also monitor in advance when the country appoints the highest judicial and examination personnel. All of these gradual developments show that the members of the Control Yuan during the Tutelage Period earnestly carried out their tasks and have won the trust of the people, and they also show the great expectations of the country for the Constitutional Control Yuan in the future.</p>
<p>Now that the Constitution has just begun, the people are eager for governance. At the same time, after eight years of war, the country has continued to suppress the rebellion, and the economy is difficult, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. At this time, all parties should work together to seek improvement. Although responsibilities are specific, efforts must be consistent. You gentlemen should be able to act in accordance with the wishes of the people and the interests of the country, continue the unfinished work of the Control Yuan during the Tutelage Period, and complete the great mission entrusted to it by the Constitution. I am entrusted by the country to shoulder the heavy responsibility of implementing the Constitution. All the functions entrusted to your Yuan by the Constitution will naturally be followed in accordance with the law so that they can be fully exercised in order to exert the full effectiveness of the Five-Power system and lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country. I am willing to encourage each other with you. President Chiang delivering a speech at the Control Yuan meeting (Central News Agency photo)</p>

<h3>工程師節感言</h3>
<p>Thoughts on Engineers' Day</p>
<p>工程的民生觀　趙曾玨</p>
<p>The Concept of Engineering as a Matter of People's Livelihood Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>The practical responsibility of engineers is to "utilize resources for the benefit of the people," and the "people" here should refer to the people's livelihood. In other words, the responsibility of engineers is to use scientific methods, manpower, and material resources to seek a better life for humanity. Throughout history, there has never been a famous engineering project that was not related to the people's welfare, nor has there been a famous engineer who did not seek the people's welfare. Today, on Engineers' Day, the Xia Yu we commemorate and his water control project are the best examples. The water conservancy of Dujiangyan by Li Bing and his son in later generations, and the water conservancy of Guanzhong by Li Yizhi in modern times, are also good examples. On the edge of Shanghai along the Shangchuan Railway, there is a seawall called the Qin Gong Dike, which was built by Qin Yun, the former magistrate of Chuansha County in the Qing Dynasty. It extends for dozens of kilometers from Wusong in Shanghai to the border of Fengxian County, preventing tidal intrusion and protecting farmland. Therefore, although he was a Manchu, the people still praise him to this day. Of course, these water conservancy projects have benefited the people the most widely and deeply, so they are particularly praised by contemporaries and later generations. In fact, other projects, such as the construction of railways, highways, bridges, and buildings, are all beneficial to the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Currently, there is an even more magnificent and far-reaching project that is almost unprecedented and has made the world look at it with new eyes, considering it the beginning of a new democratic era of people's welfare. This is the TVA multi-purpose project initiated by U.S. President Roosevelt. It is a complex of mechanical and electrical, chemical, civil engineering, water conservancy, transportation, and medical engineering, completely designed and managed by engineers. It is also a complex of agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and health undertakings, and its organization is an enterprise-oriented institution independent of the political system, which is its most distinctive feature. Because it was a creation, it was not without opposition at the beginning. However, because of the efforts of the entire organization and the widespread benefit, it was finally successful. Furthermore, because it can truly benefit the people's livelihood and its effectiveness is obvious, it has finally won the support of the people and has made progressive people all over the world amazed and admired, filled with longing.</p>
<p>Based on the above examples from China and abroad, we dare to say that any government, organization, or individual who can seek the welfare of the people, so-called "bringing the people to comfort," will be supported and will succeed. And these arduous tasks that truly seek the welfare of the people cannot be accomplished without the efforts of engineers. Therefore, the greatest mission of engineers is to solve the problems of the people's livelihood, and in shouldering this great mission, we recognize that: (1) All projects that benefit the people's livelihood are valuable projects. (2) Engineering should aim for long-term achievements and should not be concerned with short-term gains. (3) Engineering is not commerce. Its value should be measured by whether or not it benefits the people's livelihood, and should not be calculated solely in terms of monetary value.</p>
<p>The above three points may serve as the goals of engineers' efforts. As far as our country is concerned, if we still follow the path of an agricultural society that has existed for thousands of years, instead of embarking on the road of industrialization, I am afraid that it will be difficult to survive in the modern world. Therefore, at this time, the responsibility of us engineers is truly unprecedentedly important. If engineers do not build, who will build? If engineers do not push the giant wheel of industrialization, who will push it? Today is Engineers' Day, a day for us engineers to review the past and plan for the future, so I would like to offer some of my humble opinions for everyone's guidance.</p>
<p>工程師的時代使命　徐恩曾</p>
<p>The Era-Defining Mission of Engineers Xu Enzeng</p>
<p>The annual Engineers' Day on June 6th has arrived again. Economic recession and industrial decay, this is a terrible crisis. Should we, the engineers who aspire to build a new China, just sigh and wait for our demise? Or should we awaken, examine ourselves, and do our best? Today's world is truly a world of technological competition. Technologically advanced countries can increase efficiency and reduce costs. Recently, the English version of the Reader's Digest published a small statistic in its May issue, pointing out that if a Soviet worker wants to buy a pound of bread, he has to work for one hour and seven minutes, while in the United States, it only takes seven and a half minutes. That is to say, the efficiency of the United States is ten times higher than that of the Soviet Union. Although capitalists and workers have made great contributions to the technological superiority and industrial achievements of the United States, the contribution of engineers can at least be on par with that of capitalists and workers.</p>
<p>The number of students graduating from engineering colleges in our country is not small, and their academic performance in school is not bad. Engineering students studying in Europe and the United States often outperform their classmates in the host countries in their studies. A few engineers who stay to work in the countries where they studied have extremely good results because they have good working equipment and environment, and they are highly praised by engineers and industrial circles in various countries. However, engineers working in the country often do not use what they have learned. Some engage in politics, some engage in business, and even those who work in their own positions are either teaching in schools or working in technical administrative positions in the government. The number of people who can make a real contribution to China's industrial construction is extremely small. We can also push the responsibility onto the government, onto the industrial community, onto the social environment, but the ambition and aspirations we had when we chose to study engineering, as well as the phenomenon of the country's industrial decline and technological backwardness, will not improve on their own.</p>
<p>Our fellow engineers must change our past passive attitude. We must strive for initiative and strive for the opportunity to serve the country and the industrial community. Of course, we do not want to be lackeys of capitalists, but we should not be preoccupied with planning for ourselves every day, wanting to become capitalists ourselves. Because in other countries, the state's controlled economy policy, the strong united front of workers, and the opportunity for private entrepreneurs to exploit workers' interests and evade government taxes no longer exist. Although there have been many opportunistic elements taking advantage of the chaos in China during and after the war, making a fortune from national disasters and civil wars in a short period of time, we engineers with ambition and ability are unwilling to waste our years of learning and ruin our promising future in this way. Once the situation is stabilized and the country is on track, these speculative elements will be eliminated and purged. Those who have real ability, whose work is the most diligent, and who only plan for the country and the nation, will be the national engineers of the future and the leaders of economic construction in the future.</p>
<p>Today's world has clearly separated into two major camps, labor and capital. Engineers are the natural intermediaries between labor and capital. The modern machines they research and design require huge capital to acquire. Engineers naturally know the contribution of capital to industry. These machines can of course continue to operate automatically in most cases, but they still require a considerable number of workers to take care of them. The contribution of labor is also well known to the engineers who are in charge of engineering work. We need capitalists to be interested in investing, and we need workers to be interested in working hard, not to be lazy, and not to strike. The interests of both parties must be taken into account. Besides the engineers who are on the scene, who else can understand the interests of both parties, and who else can mediate the conflicts between the two parties! 本</p>

<p>Fushun Coal Mine Achieves Record-Breaking Production Increase Since Takeover</p>
<p>— 瀋陽航信　本報記者　趙展</p>
<p>— Shenyang Airmail Dispatch, Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>The total output of Fushun Coal Mine in May was 146,822 tons, and the output was 93,396 tons, breaking previous records and creating the highest production volume since the takeover. In May of last year, during what was known as the heyday of industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China, the highest monthly output of Fushun was only 137,600 tons, and the output was 79,036 tons. Over the past year, the flames of war have spread, and people generally lamented that the industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China were fragmented and declining daily – the mood of disappointment reached a freezing point. But the miracle created by Fushun is amazing, giving pessimism a head-on blow.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Fushun Mining Bureau, its record of production increases in the recent three months is: total output in March was 107,622 tons, estimated output was 45,000 tons, actual output was about 50,000 tons; total output in April was 108,784 tons, estimated output was 50,000 tons, actual output was 61,600 tons; total output in May was 146,822 tons, estimated output was 80,000 tons, actual output was 93,396 tons. The highest daily output in May was 6,880 tons, and the average daily output was 4,736 tons. The highest output record was 173 train cars, totaling 5,208 tons, which also broke the previous transportation record. Before March, the average daily coal output was 2,000 to 3,000 tons.</p>
<p>生產鬥爭　「奇蹟」是怎樣造成的？</p>
<p>Production Struggle - How Was the "Miracle" Created?</p>
<p>Wei Hua-kun, the director of the Fushun Mining Bureau, told reporters: "This is the harvest of the workers' shovels and picks, the result of the efforts of all the workers to increase production." Director Wei took over the mining bureau on February 20th. The output on the second day after he took office (February 21st) was 2,339 tons. He explained that the reasons for the low production efficiency at that time were: first, there was no money, and the workers were owed two months' salary and grain and rice allowances; second, the treatment was unfair, the salaries of the staff were too high, and the salaries of the workers were too low. Because of this, the workers petitioned every day and had no intention of working. At the same time, some of the staff were busy escaping, creating a general sense of unease that almost suffocated Fushun. His method was to first repay the workers' debts, filling each worker's pocket with 2 million circulation coupons. He raised the workers' wages, and later it was the staff who petitioned, not the workers. The workers had a day off on May Day, and a grand opera was performed to entertain the workers. On this day, the workers' wives put on rouge and powder, and each child had a bottle of soda. As a result, everyone in Fushun laughed, the workers' hearts blossomed, the desire to produce was stimulated, and a fierce production movement was launched. Circulation coupons competed with prices, and production competed with circulation coupons. A real production struggle brought Fushun back to life. More interestingly, the director declared that he would "commit suicide" to urge the workers.</p>
<p>Fushun has become a complete industrial system. Although it was dismantled incompletely by the Soviet army after the liberation of Northeast China, it still has more than 80 by-products with coal as its center. In the past, the Fushun Coal Mine occupied a dazzling position in the economic resources of Northeast China. Now it is supporting the difficult situation in Northeast China alone, which is even more valuable. From bombs manufactured by ordnance factories to stoves for citizens to cook, they all depend on it.</p>
<p>重要副產</p>
<p>Important By-Products</p>
<p>Important by-products, such as gasoline extracted from oil shale, are as precious as blood in the Northeast, where railways are cut off. Gasoline production was 18,480 gallons in March, increasing to 61,000 gallons in May. The ammonium sulfate, which is most needed by ordnance factories, increased from 307 tons in March to 492 tons in April, breaking previous records. Cement, which is indispensable for building fortifications, increased from 90 tons in March to 304 tons in April. Its steel plant is the only special steel manufacturer in China, and its products are being airlifted to Guannei from June 1st. This steel is the most needed in China, and it used to be purchased from foreign countries. In May, 60 tons of steel were produced, including 22 tons of carbon tool steel in April, 6 tons of spring steel in April, 15 tons of bamboo tool steel in March, and 20 tons of chrome steel in March. In addition, 159 gallons of special diesel were produced in April, 4,000 gallons of mixed machine oil were produced in April, 19 tons of soft asphalt were produced in April, 1,987 cubic meters of oxygen were produced in April, 155 cubic meters of hydrogen were produced in April, 39 tons of sulfuric acid were produced in April, 577 kilograms of liquid ammonia were produced in April, and 227 tons of calcium carbide were produced in May. Some by-product production is too small to be introduced, and many other by-products cannot be produced due to insufficient power.</p>
<p>克服困難</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties</p>
<p>Fushun is not without difficulties in the heat of increasing production, but difficulties cannot weaken production. The workers' spirit of assault overcomes the difficult conditions of the objective environment. The biggest difficulties are the lack of funds, food, and materials, which are almost old problems that cannot be solved smoothly. Although the salaries of the employees in March, April, and May have been paid in full, the banks lack cash, and the appropriations from the administrative headquarters cannot be withdrawn on time. Often, when the cash is in hand, the prices have already risen, and the amount that was budgeted as sufficient is now in deficit. Since the method of calculating coal prices based on grain prices has been implemented, the financial difficulties have been reduced. At this time of year when there is a shortage of food, the food problem is indeed serious. Currently, soybean cakes are the staple food for 40,000 workers, and they are eagerly awaiting the ripening of wheat. Although coal production has increased, there is a severe shortage of pit props, explosives, and repair parts for stripping machinery, which are very difficult to purchase and have a great impact. These difficulties vaguely show a layer of shadow on the future of production. From a purely technical point of view, this kind of all-out production increase may have many weaknesses, but in the special situation of Northeast China's crisis, there is only one goal: to produce a large amount of coal.</p>
<p>豆饼小姐</p>
<p>Miss Soybean Cake</p>
<p>Every miner in Fushun has become a labor hero, making Fushun "rejuvenate." What created the "miracle" is the great human power, and what supports this great human power are soybean cakes and soybean residue. On the supplementary page of the "Workers" five-day publication, which was launched on June 1st, a letter from a worker to Miss Soybean Cake was published. He wrote: "Ever since I approached your beautiful face, I have truly felt like we have known each other for a long time. I can't help but call out, 'Dear Miss Soybean Cake!' To be honest, I cannot survive without you." Director Wei Hua-kun said: "Our workers are too lovely, I believe it is absolutely impossible to incite labor unrest."</p>
<p>The production volume and output of Fushun Coal Mine in May broke the record of the three years since the restoration of Northeast China. This great achievement is the result of the unity and hard work of all levels. The reporter saw the workers' high production desire and excited working mood, and was truly moved! It made us know that in the war-torn Northeast, there is a new vitality in industry and mining.</p>

<h3>The Reason Yang Mei Hasn't Eaten for Nine Years - An Answer Must Be Found Quickly - Hu Xianwen and Others Express Their Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 5th] Hu Xianwen, the president of the Municipal Zhongzheng Hospital, and Hu Xianhua, the director of surgery, published "What Attitude Should We Use to Evaluate Yang Mei's Non-Eating Problem?", which is divided into: (1) Yang Mei Becomes an International Figure, (2) The Process of Yang Mei's Initial Examination, (3) Should Yang Mei Become a Research Subject, (4) What is Science, and (5) Epilogue. They still feel perplexed as to what kind of mystery explains the fact that Yang Mei has not eaten or defecated for 21 days, and that urination is more frequent than water intake. The article mentioned that there was a person named Succi, who specialized in fasting as a profession for physiologists to study. Once, in an experiment at the Paris Science Museum, he set a record of 50 days without food, which was the highest record of his life. However, after fasting for several days, his weight, physical strength, and mental state consistently declined. By the 40th day, his weight had decreased by 25%. In the last few days, his physical condition was so weak that he could barely sustain himself. In addition, Mayor Terence of England died after 74 days of fasting during the Irish political struggle in 1920. During Yang Mei's 21-day observation period, although no clinical examination was conducted, her weight, physical strength, mental state, and breathing were even better than the two individuals above in terms of tolerance to hunger. Her pulse and temperature remained unchanged. Therefore, regardless of whether it is due to a special physiological mechanism, pathological changes, or artificial pretense, it should be studied with a purely objective attitude to find an answer as soon as possible.</p>
<p>President Hu and others believe that scientific research should focus on facts and seek experimental results. It is too risky to make a judgment on the reason for Yang's non-eating after only 21 days of initial observation. They also stated: A scientist's mind should be like a pure, flawless blank sheet of paper, without any inherent colors. They must observe natural phenomena with a purely objective and open-minded attitude, integrate the results of various experiments, analyze them in detail, and seek affirmative or negative answers based on facts. Yang Mei has not eaten for 21 days without significant abnormalities. Scientists should follow this phenomenon to distinguish right from wrong. If it is concluded that Yang Mei's long-term non-eating is a foregone conclusion and cannot be explained by existing knowledge, then they should correct some past theoretical errors and look for a new scientific path. It is essential to avoid ignoring or being stubborn, thinking that it is inconsistent with existing theories, and abandoning existing opportunities, phenomena, or facts. This would be a great loss for scientists exploring the true meaning of the mysterious universe. Currently, many people are deeply interested in Yang Mei, influenced by the nine years of not eating. However, scientists should maintain an absolutely objective attitude. They personally participated in observing Yang Mei's 21 days of non-eating, which is a fact that ordinary people cannot do. Therefore, Yang Mei is a scientific research subject, and there should be no doubt about it. The Hu brothers finally stated: The reason for this mysterious non-eating must be found as soon as possible to avoid confusing social rumors.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Ministry of Health has not yet issued any instructions regarding Yang Mei's non-eating incident. The Bureau of Health has recently sent the observation report of Yang Mei's three weeks to the Medical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health.</p>

<h3>US House Passes Bill to Reduce Funds for European and Chinese Aid - Burch Advocates Restoring Japanese Aid Fund</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] The US House of Representatives passed a bill from the Appropriations Committee during a voice vote today, reducing the $463.3 million in the China Aid Program by $63.3 million. It also reduced the government's foreign aid amount to $5.9 billion, $71,000, and $228. Supporters of the government are hoping that the Senate will restore the $533 million in foreign aid that the bill has already cut when it votes on the bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet completed its review of the foreign aid bill, so the Senate Appropriations Committee may restore the amount cut by the House Committee. Since the motion to amend the European Recovery Program and the China Aid Program, which proposed reducing the period to one year, was rejected, the House of Representatives passed the foreign aid bill without making any major modifications. The aforementioned amendment, which proposed reducing the aid period from 15 months to one year to proportionally restore the reduced foreign aid amount, was ultimately rejected by a vote of 148 to 113. The China Aid portion of the bill was only slightly modified, as the House passed Zhou Yide's amendment, slightly modifying the wording of the regulations regarding the supervision of the use of funds to make the meaning more tactful.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, United Press] According to senior official sources, Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has made a commitment to the Department of the Army and the State Department that he will do his best to get the Senate to resume discussion of the $150 million plan to assist Japanese economic recovery, which the House Appropriations Committee has already refused to approve.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The government now hopes that Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will be able to restore the $553 million cut by the House of Representatives when the Senate discusses the foreign aid appropriations bill. The passage of the Marshall Plan in the Senate in April was thanks to Vandenberg. It is now known that Vandenberg is once again working on this matter. Senator Connally, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the House's vote would definitely be overturned by the Senate. Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, stated that he would first study the matter before expressing his opinion prior to the Senate vote. Opponents of the cuts all stated that Congress's inconsistency would shake the faith of European democratic countries in the United States and strengthen the Soviet Union's movement to communize Western Europe. Rayburn, the former Speaker of the House, who does not often speak, also stated today that we should fulfill what we promised to friendly nations just a few weeks ago. If we are too stingy, we will only be mocked by Moscow.</p>
<h3>Greece Notifies the Balkan Committee of Its Willingness to Negotiate a Peace Treaty with Albania - Responding to Moscow's "Peace Offensive"</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Authoritative sources in Greece revealed: Greece has notified the United Nations Balkan Committee, declaring that it is prepared to negotiate a peace treaty with Albania. According to a Greek spokesperson, the Albanian government declared war on Greece in 1940, so the Greek government still recognizes that a state of war exists between Greece and Albania, and a peace treaty should be used to end it.</p>
<p>Diplomatic observers here believe that whether this action by the Greek government can lead to peace in the Balkans depends on whether the issue of the Greek guerrilla movement can be resolved. The fact that Greek guerrilla commander Markos made a tentative peace broadcast on June 1 may still be part of Moscow's recent peace offensive. The broadcast stated that the Greek guerrillas were prepared to discuss any proposal aimed at ending the fratricide. Before Markos made that broadcast, the governments of Bulgaria and Albania had also stated that they were willing to resume relations with the Athens government under certain conditions.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] The Communist-controlled "Greek Democratic League" on the 4th called on Britain to promote a peaceful settlement of the Greek civil war. Observers said that Britain would likely refuse. In addition, a radio station in the guerrilla mountains of northern Greece announced on the 3rd that rebel commander Vafiades would negotiate peace in Greece. Greek government leaders rejected this proposal.</p>

<h3>South Africa's New Prime Minister Announces Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Break Away from the British Commonwealth</p>
<p>[Reuters, Pretoria, 4th] South African Prime Minister Malan delivered his first broadcast speech after taking office today, stating that as long as it does not hinder South Africa's sovereign status, South Africa is very happy to maintain good relations with Britain and other British Commonwealth countries. South Africa recognizes its partnership in the Commonwealth, so it does not intend to adopt an isolationist policy. Regarding South Africa's position in the United Nations, the policy of this government is completely consistent with that of the previous government, that is, South Africa's accession to the United Nations is based on the understanding that its internal affairs and sovereignty will not be interfered with by the outside world. We will continue this policy and refuse to tie our destiny to any great power or organization.</p>

<h3>Major Sulfur Explosion and Fire on Honan Road: Over a Hundred Injured, Fire Chief Dies in the Line of Duty; Food Storage Facility Blamed, Neighbors Suffer, Losses Beyond Estimation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 5:10 PM, sulfur stored at the Zhongfa Warehouse, number 10, Lane 333 on Honan Road, suddenly ignited during transport, leading to a fire. The large quantity of sulfur then caught fire and exploded, causing a major disaster with over a hundred casualties and widespread damage to neighboring properties, resulting in a tragic fire comparable to the boiler explosion at the Zhen Tai Rubber Factory on February 21st, 1933, the worst in over a decade. The incident occurred during the Eastern District's office closing hours, causing traffic congestion. Pedestrians, suddenly hearing a deafening explosion followed by smoke filling the sky, fled in panic. Nearby residents and shops hurriedly closed their doors, creating chaos. Windows and large glass panes in the surrounding areas, including Nanking Road, Kiukiang Road, Honan Road Central, Hankow Road, and Shantung Road, were almost entirely shattered by the explosion, with estimated losses exceeding hundreds of millions of yuan. The fire department dispatched fifteen fire engines from various districts of the city, using over thirty water hoses to battle the blaze. Water supplies were temporarily exhausted, requiring a request to the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company to increase water pressure in the affected area. The fire, reaching over a thousand feet in height and covering two hundred square feet, was brought under control at 5:50 PM. The flames were extinguished around 7:00 PM, after burning for approximately two hours. In addition to the complete destruction of the Zhongfa Warehouse, Xie Da Pharmacy, and Shuntai Paper Company, neighboring businesses such as the News Daily, the Shang Bao (Commercial Daily), Lao Zheng Xing Restaurant, Tong Hua Lou Restaurant, and the Tonghui Bank dormitory were also affected. The News Daily's warehouse, being in close proximity to Zhongfa, was unfortunately burned down. The Shang Bao suffered water damage internally, resulting in significant losses. Fire Chief Yu Changgen, a veteran of the Central District team with twenty-one years of service, was struck by a column of fire ejected from the explosion as he arrived at the scene, dying instantly. Forty-six injured individuals, including firefighters, coolies, pedestrians, and residents, were transported to various hospitals, their names recorded. Three of them succumbed to their injuries by 1:00 AM this morning. Approximately sixty others sustained minor injuries. The cause of the incident and the actual extent of the damage are currently under full investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>A Deafening Explosion, Black Smoke Billowing, Fire Department Personnel Rushing to the Rescue, Many Without Time to Don Fire Gear</h3>
<p>When the fire broke out, it initially went unnoticed due to the warehouse's location deep within the alley. However, when three workers covered in flames ran out of the alley next to the News Daily, passersby noticed and rushed to remove their burning clothes. Their skin was severely burned. One of them collapsed immediately, a horrifying sight that sent onlookers scattering. Shortly after, white smoke billowed into the sky from Qing He Li, Lane 333, Honan Road, at precisely 5:10 PM.</p>
<p>The Fire Department's Central District team, located south of the intersection of Honan Road and Hankow Road, only a stone's throw from the scene, saw the white smoke rising. Firefighters, many without time to don their fire gear, departed immediately. One engine headed to Hankow Road, another to Kiukiang Road. The white smoke spread and thickened. Just as firefighters unrolled their hoses, preparing to enter the alley and extinguish the flames, a sudden and deafening explosion occurred. A column of black smoke shot up a thousand feet, and flames spread like an umbrella, emitting intense heat. The time was 5:20 PM. Following the explosion, a burning wooden beam flew out of the fire scene and landed on Fire Engine number 31, which had just stopped in front of Lao Zheng Xing Restaurant, fatally striking Fire Chief Yu Changgen in the head, killing him instantly. Fire Chief Qiu Xiangyun was also seriously injured.</p>
<p>Eight Water Hoses Couldn't Quell the Fire</p>
<p>Firefighters bravely connected the water hoses and began spraying water from both Kiukiang Road and Hankow Road. However, despite the efforts of eight water hoses, the sulfur fire raged fiercely and was difficult to control. Soon, the lookout towers of the Hongkew, Jing'an Temple, and Yichang Road fire stations all spotted the towering flames. Ten pump trucks from Xinzha, Hubei, and other districts were dispatched to assist. At the same time, the Central District team sent a large pump truck, a ladder truck, and a hose truck, concentrating on the area around Shantung Road, Hankow Road, Honan Road, and Jiujiang Road, increasing the number of water hoses to over thirty. As a result, nearby water taps were insufficient. Chief Ye of the Fire Department urgently telegraphed the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company to increase water pressure in the fire area, desperately fighting the fire.</p>
<p>The East Wind Fanned the Flames, Spreading the Fire Everywhere</p>
<p>The Zhongfa Warehouse was quickly consumed. Flames spread to the News Daily's paper warehouse to the east, Xie Da Pharmacy to the west, and Shuntai Paper Company at 275-277 Kiukiang Road and Lao Zheng Xing Restaurant at 273 Kiukiang Road and Tong Hua Lou Restaurant at 281 Kiukiang Road to the north. The east wind was strong at the time, causing the flames to spread westward to the Shang Bao Building at 289 Kiukiang Road and the Tonghui Bank's upper-level dormitory on the third floor at 295 Kiukiang Road. After forty minutes of desperate effort from the firefighters, the fire was brought under control.</p>
<p>The Two Newspaper Offices Suffered Severe Losses</p>
<p>At the News Daily, in addition to the complete destruction of the paper warehouse, the employees' dormitory on the fifth floor, the workers' dormitory on the third and fourth floors, and the copperplate photography and darkroom were also affected. All the glass windows on all floors at the rear of the building were shattered by the sulfur explosion. The north-facing wall was cracked from the shock. Two printing presses in the printing department were damaged. On one of them, the lead plate melted due to excessive heat, and molten lead flowed into the machine's interior, making it difficult to repair. The motor components were damaged by water, making them unusable for the time being. Furthermore, the damage to paper, ink, and other printing materials was difficult to estimate. At the Shang Bao, the employees' dormitory on the third floor was completely destroyed, and the editorial and interviewing department on the second floor and the printing department below suffered water damage, resulting in substantial losses. The fire was completely extinguished by 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>When the fire broke out, Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Central Fire Department, supervised the rescue efforts with Zhongdui Deputy Zhang, Section Chief Ye Binyong, District Captain Zhu Zhifeng, Deputy Captain Lin Bohua, and personnel from various district teams. Deputy Chief Wang of the Ambulance Headquarters and officials from the Port Fire Department also arrived at the scene. In addition to officers from the Criminal Division of the General Bureau and the Flying Fortresses and the Security Police Brigade, Feng Wenyao, Director of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, accompanied by Li Yinmin, Chief of the Criminal Section, also led police officers to the scene, working with military police to maintain order. Shortly after the fire broke out, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping also arrived to personally direct the operation. The firefighters' spirit of selflessness was highly praised by nearby residents.</p>
<p>Cause of the Fire</p>
<p>The cause of the fire was that at approximately 5:00 PM yesterday, the Zhongfa Warehouse received a large shipment of sulfur from the Shi Fu Ji Transportation Company at Lane 318, Tiantong Road. While seven coolies were unloading the sulfur, it accidentally caught fire. They were unable to extinguish it, and within minutes, the fire spread to the sulfur pile, leading to an explosion. The three workers seen running out of the alley next to the News Daily were coolies who had been participating in the rescue efforts. The sulfur reportedly belonged to the Xinsheng Match Factory. Furthermore, it was learned that one coolie was missing and may have perished in the fire.</p>

<h3>Passenger and Freight Transport Price Increases on the Two Railways: Likely to Take Effect Tomorrow; Passenger Transport Up 50%, Freight Transport Up 90%</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The railway price increases that have been brewing for over a month may take effect tomorrow. According to Xie Zhen, Deputy Director and Transportation Director of the Two Railway Bureaus, who told reporters late last night: Passenger fares will be adjusted by 50%, and freight rates by approximately 90%. This is likely to begin tomorrow. However, the Railway Bureau has not yet formally received the order from the Ministry of Communications. The above information was relayed by telephone from the Railway Bureau's Beijing Office. Therefore, whether the new prices will take effect tomorrow depends on whether the Ministry of Communications' price increase order arrives in time. It is also learned that this price increase will be graded for freight, with general goods increasing by 90% and valuables by 100% to 120%. The Railway Bureau is currently calculating the new fares based on this principle.</p>
<h3>Authorities Supervise and Dissuade Students; The Large-Scale Demonstration Did Not Materialize; All Places Were Quiet and Uneventful All Day Long</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The "Association Against American Support for Japan," organized by a segment of students in this city, had originally planned to unite all schools in the city yesterday morning to hold an anti-support-Japan demonstration. However, thanks to the supervision and dissuasion of the relevant authorities, including the security police, military police, and education officials, the demonstration was ultimately frozen separately.</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM, to prevent students from using Bund and Zhongshan Parks as assembly centers, the security authorities temporarily closed those parks. At Jiaotong University, military police were stationed tightly, preventing the demonstrating students from taking a single step. At Tongji University, only a few demonstrating students left the school early, and the next group of demonstrating students was dissuaded. At Fudan University, at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, more than 300 students gathered, preparing to depart from the main gate, but after being dissuaded by military police, they attempted to find several shortcuts and leave by circuitous routes, but all were dissuaded from returning to the school. There was a brief altercation at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, which was quickly quelled. Demonstrating students at the China Vocational and Technical College of Industry and Commerce were also dissuaded by military police on Zhu Bao San Road. On the Bund, more than a thousand students and middle schoolers gathered after 3:00 PM, but they dispersed separately around 6:00 PM. The details of the dissuasion efforts are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Ordeal of Persuading Students at Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>After the Jiaotong University Student Union held a symposium on the "Oppose American Support for Japan" issue on the evening of the 3rd, it convened a meeting of representatives from all departments on the afternoon of the 4th and 5th, deciding to request a day off on the 5th to hold a "Oppose American Support for Japan, Rescue the National Crisis Demonstration," and contacted other schools to participate. After learning of this, the school authorities, led by President Cheng Xiaogang, convened a meeting with the student union's officers and responsible persons from each department late into the night, earnestly persuading them from 10:00 PM until 3:00 AM the next morning. Zhao Zengjue, president of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the school, and Police Commissioner Yu Shuping also arrived at the school to dissuade the students. Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education and Mayor Wu contacted President Cheng by telephone, asking him to stop the students' action. However, all the dissuasion efforts were ineffective, and the students insisted on their original position. The school then posted a notice late at night on the 4th, making a final appeal, stating: "We have just learned that this afternoon, the Student Union convened a so-called meeting of department representatives without the approval of the school and openly launched a move to request a day off and go out to demonstrate on the 5th. These students are disregarding their studies to take alarming actions and are acting arbitrarily without the school's permission, which is highly inappropriate. The school has convened a meeting of the heads of all departments and determined that the demonstration should be strictly prohibited to avoid causing trouble and that classes should be held as usual to maintain academic integrity. Anyone who ignores the school's good-faith dissuasion and insists on their position, and if an accident occurs as a result of insisting on going out to demonstrate, in addition to being subject to legal sanctions, the school will impose severe penalties for violating school rules." President Cheng Xiaogang and the heads of various departments, including Wang Zhiche, Qiu Weiyu, Zhong Zhaolin, and sixteen others, also issued a written statement, declaring: "If the students still do not understand the good intentions of our persuasion and stubbornly insist on their views, we will deeply feel that our guidance has been inadequate and will have no choice but to resign collectively."</p>
<p>Due to the persuasion of the teachers, the Student Union convened an emergency meeting of department representatives at 10:00 AM yesterday to reconsider the resolution on the large-scale demonstration. President Cheng and several professors attended the meeting again to persuade the students. President Cheng earnestly explained the relationship of various interests, urging the students not to be swayed by temporary emotional impulses, but to use reason and make wise decisions to cancel the demonstration. President Cheng stated that opposing American support for Japan does not necessarily have to be expressed through a general request for leave and demonstrations, and can also be done through issuing declarations and other methods. If the students still insist on demonstrating and the school's persuasion fails again, then he and the professors will decide to resign. The department representatives reconsidered the question of whether to demonstrate, and until 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the result of the vote was still to decide to demonstrate. At that time, the security authorities had already dispatched a security police brigade, two battalions of security police, and a company of youth soldiers, along with more than ten tanks, and had arrived in the Xujiahui area, cutting off nearby traffic and surrounding the school's front and back gates to prevent the students from leaving the school to demonstrate. The Jiaotong University students inside the school then assembled a team of three or four hundred people at around 2:00 PM, each carrying cartoon flags, and marched around the school once. Because the front and back gates were closely guarded by military police outside, they could not leave and remained in a stalemate for a long time. The team then shouted various "anti-support-Japan" slogans in the school before dispersing. The military police guarding outside did not withdraw until around 9:30 PM in the evening.</p>

<h3>Forty-Six Seriously Injured, Three Died This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, approximately one hundred people were directly or indirectly injured in the fire. Apart from some with minor injuries who were bandaged and discharged, there was one death on the scene: Yu Changgen, a first-class driver of the Central Fire Department.

Those sent to the China-America Hospital included passersby Yan Xigao, Cui Li-shi, and Bao Genxiang, the person in charge of the Zhongfa Warehouse. Those sent to the Gongji Hospital included Shi Fu Ji workers Lu Liechang, Shi Yizhou, and passersby Yue Dingyi, Chen Defang, Kang Quanfu, and Wang Renxiang, totaling six people. In total, there were forty-six seriously injured men and women, including firefighters. Among them, Shi Fu Ji workers Wang Defu, Yu Dingshu, Lu Yinchang, Lu Liechang, and Shi Yizhou were closest to the explosion and therefore sustained the most severe burns. This morning at 1:00 AM, Lu Liechang, Shi Yizhou, and Wang Defu had succumbed to their injuries, and the lives of the remaining two were also in danger.</p>
<h3>Approximately A Thousand Students Singing Songs and Shouting Slogans; Lining Up on the Bund Sidewalk; Traffic Disrupted, Park Closed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the Bund, there were rumors that students were gathering at the Bund Park. Therefore, starting at 10:30 AM yesterday, the security authorities closed the Bund Park, temporarily suspending its opening. In the morning, there were no obvious signs of students gathering on the Bund. However, on a section of the Bund road, there were small teams of military police patrolling back and forth. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, more and more students gathered. Because the Bund Park had been temporarily closed, they lined up on the sidewalk from numbers 24 to 28 on the Bund, numbering approximately a thousand, mostly middle school students. When inquiring individually, the students belonged to universities such as John's, Jiaotong, Datong, Daxia, and Fudan, and middle schools such as McLaren, Chuneng, and the Tongji Affiliated Middle School. The security authorities also successively dispatched four squadrons of security police and a squad of mounted patrols to supervise the lined-up students separately. Apart from singing songs and shouting slogans, the students took no other action. Some students who attempted to leave the group were temporarily detained. For a time, the Bund was crowded with onlookers, and traffic was somewhat disrupted. Around 6:00 PM, the students began to disperse individually or in small groups.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Held a Press Conference to Report on the Course of the Students' Special Actions; Instructed Jiaotong University Authorities to Conduct an Investigation into Seven Points</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the decision by students in the city's universities and middle schools to request a day off yesterday to hold a large-scale "Oppose American Support for Japan" demonstration, Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan held a press conference in the city hall's auditorium at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. First, Mayor Wu reported on the special actions of Jiaotong University students, stating: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Jiaotong University convened a meeting of all departments and ended the meeting at 5:00 PM. The meeting resolved to request a day off today and hold a large-scale demonstration. After receiving the report, the school's president immediately tried to stop them, but to no avail. After hearing the news, Mayor Wu and Police Commissioner Yu, believing that the demonstration violated the emergency measures during the suppression of rebellion period and had to be strictly prohibited, ordered the school to inform the students that if an accident occurred as a result of the demonstration, the students would be fully responsible, and the government would bear no responsibility. At the same time, the school's president and more than twenty professors jointly signed and issued a notice, warning of two points: (1) Collective demonstrations violate school rules, and participants will be severely punished according to school rules. (2) If the students are stubborn and insist on going out to demonstrate, the professors will be responsible for failing to supervise and educate them and will have no choice but to resign collectively.</p>
<p>Investigating the Reasons for the Students' Insistence; The Authorities Believe They Were Manipulated by Communist Bandits</p>
<p>After this, the president and professors again did their best to persuade the students to abandon the demonstration, repeatedly arguing with the students for a long time, but the students still stubbornly insisted. Their final and only reason was: "Today's large-scale demonstration was jointly decided by one hundred and twenty organizations in the city, and they must go to the Bund Park to assemble as agreed and depart together."</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons for the students' insistence, the municipal authorities believe that the demonstration was clearly being manipulated by Communist bandits. Because the Jiaotong University department meeting only made the decision the day before the demonstration, how could they have coincided with the other one hundred and twenty organizations without any coordination? Therefore, the municipal authorities believe it is extremely necessary to investigate. Mayor Wu said that if such an incident occurred in a foreign country, a prosecutor's office could be convened immediately, ordering the perpetrators to answer publicly. Now, in order to respect the school authorities, the school is requested to be responsible for investigating the initiators of this demonstration and publicly answer the questions. Otherwise, the government will order them to hand over the perpetrators and pursue legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Official Document Sent to Jiaotong University</p>
<p>The municipal government sent an official document to Jiaotong University yesterday, stating the seven points that should be investigated as follows: (1) Who requested action from the department representative meeting? (2) Who advocated for a strike and demonstration at the department representative meeting? (3) Who proposed a lunch gathering at 11:00 AM and assembling at the Bund at 1:00 PM within the department representative meeting? (4) The department representative meeting began at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and ended at 5:00 PM. When did they contact the one hundred and twenty organizations and decide to depart together and assemble at the Bund? (5) If they only began to contact them after the vote at 5:00 PM, what method did they use to contact the one hundred and twenty organizations so quickly (which is impossible)? (6) If they contacted the various organizations before the department representative meeting to take joint action, then who represented Jiaotong University and where and with whom did they connect? (7) What are the names of the one hundred and twenty organizations, and who is in charge?</p>
<p>Student Unrest Affects Public Security; Citizens Should Be Wary</p>
<p>Commander Xuan said in his address that the large-scale demonstration was entirely a planned conspiracy by the Communist Party. After receiving the news, the government dispersed and dissuaded them. So far, students from various universities have been unable to leave their schools under the protection of military police. Those gathering on the Bund are all middle school students. Commander Xuan expressed his satisfaction that yesterday's demonstration did not succeed. However, Commander Xuan was quite wary of future student unrest. He stated that student unrest in this city has been waiting for an opportunity to move since May. Although it has not yet caused a major disaster, he believes that after more than a month of cultivation, the foundation of each school has become solid. The bandits, seeing that their potential influence in each school has gradually grown, will definitely find ways to use it. He predicts that future student unrest will likely affect public security, and citizens should be wary.</p>
<p>Strictly Investigate Professional Students</p>
<p>Mayor Wu emphasized that the students' outrageous actions are by no means patriotic. Their demonstration slogan is "Oppose American Support for Japan," but in reality, it is to oppose American aid to China. The government will strictly investigate and severely punish these special professional students.</p>
<h3>Fifty-Four People Suspected of Inciting Student Unrest Were Arrested; Ten Were Detained and the Rest Were Released on Bail</h3>

<h3>East Caohejing Female Corpse Case: Key Suspect Arrested in Nanjing, Major General Commissioner Chen Xiwu Escorted to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 5th] On the morning of May 17th, a female corpse with over twenty knife wounds was discovered on the bank of a small river west of Shanghai at Jiangnan Zhongjiafen Shanxi, East Caohejing. This case was reported in this newspaper on May 18th. Following an investigation based on clues obtained at the scene by Chen Guangwu and other members of the Shanghai Police Bureau Criminal Police Team, a major suspect, Chen Xiwu, was arrested in Nanjing on the 5th. He was escorted to Shanghai by train that evening for interrogation. It is hoped that the arrest of suspect Chen will lead to the complete resolution of the case. After the discovery of the female corpse, a piece of letter paper was found on the body. The sender was Ms. Lin, the wife of Huang Senhua, an employee of the Budget Department of the Nanjing United Logistics Headquarters. The Shanghai Criminal Police Team immediately dispatched Chen Guangwu and others to Nanjing to investigate. They learned that Huang Senhua's wife was the sister of the deceased. The deceased's name was Lin Xinying, 28 years old, from Meixian, Guangdong. She married Chen Xiwu in her early years. Later, due to the War of Resistance, Chen went to work in the interior and married a woman who supported the war effort. This woman who supported the war was the wife's younger sister of Wang Jun, a former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs and currently a Legislative Member. After the restoration, the two wives lived together, and there were frequent disagreements. Chen Xiwu is currently a Major General Commissioner of the Traffic Police Headquarters of the United Logistics Headquarters. Chen Guangwu and others investigated the Traffic Police Headquarters and confirmed that Chen had two wives, and there were frequent quarrels. Chen's whereabouts were recently unknown. Based on various suspicious points, Chen Guangwu and others believed that Chen Xiwu was a major suspect. With the assistance of the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department, Chen was arrested at Liyuan, Nanchang Road, on the afternoon of the 5th and escorted to Shanghai by train that evening for questioning.</p>

<h3>Fudan Students Attempt to Leave Campus Repeatedly</h3>
<p>At Fudan University, more than 300 students (approximately one-tenth of the student body) gathered at 10:30 AM, holding banners and flags. They were led by a red cloth banner with white characters reading "Oppose American Imperialism's Support of Japan, Rescue the National Crisis." They intended to go out and participate in a demonstration. The police bureau received a report and rushed to the scene, immediately sealing the gate to prevent passage. The two sides were at a standoff until 1:50 PM, when the student ranks suddenly turned and passed through a side gate to the lawn next to the basketball court, intending to go to the city via Weidemai Road. However, they were again blocked by the mounted patrol team. At this time, Principal Zhang of the school, along with many teachers and staff, also arrived at the scene and repeatedly persuaded the students, promising that they could march on campus and then hold a meeting in Denghui Hall, but this was not accepted. At 2:30 PM, the marching ranks suddenly turned again, following small paths in the fields, intending to advance to Yixian Road, but they were again intercepted by the mounted patrol team ahead of them on the passage from Jiangwan to Ye Family Garden. Sun Keqiang, the Chief of the Jiangwan Police Precinct, and Wang Zhaoxin, the Chief of the Xinshijie Police Precinct, also arrived at the scene with security police and strongly urged the ranks to return to school. Although the presidium of the marching students repeatedly negotiated, the police bureau insisted that it could not retreat a step. Finally, the marching students, seeing that the time was late and the negotiation was ineffective, retreated back to the school at 4:10 PM.</p>

<p>Stimulated by the rise of prices in various non-grain sectors, rice traders are reluctant to sell easily, mainly because there are few arrivals and the intention to sell is weak. With sentiment not looking down, many rice shops are taking the opportunity to buy in, causing prices to rise. At the North Market, white japonica rice is at 7.15 million, and indica rice has reached 7.25 million, both up 200,000. Special high-quality japonica has reached 7.4 million. Later, the price of tin was reported to have risen, strengthening sentiment. The South Market initially stabilized and then rose, ultimately up 150,000 to 200,000, with the market closing tight again. Arrivals decreased yesterday, with a total of 3,249 piculs arriving at the North and South markets combined.</p>
<p>Flour is rising sharply. With rice prices rising first, traders are also trying to raise prices significantly. Retail demand is strong, sentiment is strong, and the market is very active.

<h3>Sugar Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded due to the US aid and the rise of the Taiwan dollar, so Taiwan sugar prices rose by about 10%. Local sugar was weaker, rising by different amounts of 600,000 to 700,000 and 200,000 to 300,000. According to the association's pricing, spot 24 coarse white is at 11 million to 10.85 million, four half white at 12 million, and 20 medium sand white at 10.6 million, with the next grade at 10 million.</p>

<h3>Active Tea Market</h3>
<p>The tea market saw another round of price increases yesterday. In recent days, exporters have suddenly increased their activity in purchasing Zhenmei green tea, which has boosted sentiment. Those holding goods are raising prices, and the market is increasingly active. Export tea is still being actively purchased by Tongfu Foreign Firm, Xinhua, Wuchang, and Huacha Companies. Domestic sales of patterned tea continue to be limited to small purchases from local shops, with others holding back and observing, so only sporadic transactions are taking place.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Export Licensing Method Decided by the Transportation Management Committee</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new exchange settlement method, the transportation management committee has decided to cancel the export licensing method. However, they will closely monitor foreign market prices and assess them. If foreign market prices show a significant downward trend, the government may restore the purchase method to subsidize exports.</p>
<p>In addition, the Export Promotion Office of the Transportation Management Committee will convene relevant industry leaders next week to hear general business reports from each industry after the implementation of the new method. The price of exchange settlement certificates has a significant impact on the export industry, and the office is also studying with the Central Bank how to control it and maintain a reasonable price.</p>
<h3>Trade Advisory Committee Holds Third Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The third meeting of the Trade Advisory Committee of the Central Bank's Discount and Loan Association was held on the 4th, chaired by Chen Changtong.

<h3>National Bank Agrees to Increase Interest Rates on Money Industry Deposit Guarantee Reserve</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Money Industry Association previously requested an increase in the interest rate on deposit guarantee reserves. The National Bank has now approved changing the interest rate to be calculated at a monthly rate of eight percent, effective from the second half of this year. It is also learned that the deposit guarantee reserve that banks should pay, according to the regulations of the Provisional Bank Unified Accounting System, should still be handled under the "Deposit Reserve" account, without the need to change it to "Guarantee Reserve." The National Bank has recently issued a circular to its branches for reference, based on the explanation from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Increased Stimulation Outside the Industry: Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, large players were seen both entering and exiting Chinese stocks. The process involved turnover, and capital was even more abundant. Increased stimulation from outside the industry made it easier to trigger buying interest. Most stocks rose, with few falling. Miscellaneous stocks Yongye, Xinyi, and Zhongxing hit the daily limit.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, sentiment was still buoyant due to the news of US aid, and Yongsha opened at 3,170 yuan, twice reaching 3,230 yuan. The agency fee opened low at 31 yuan and 34 yuan.

Xinhua was the only one that remained flat. In the off-market, unlisted stocks, bank and cultural stocks were popular, while the rest were stable.</p>
<p>Treasury bonds continued to rise due to the shortening of the maturity date and the renewed abundance of capital. Type A was 74.95 to 75 yuan, and Type B was 75.65 yuan. Fluctuations were minimal.</p>
<p>Government bonds fluctuated yesterday. Tongbing opened at 290,000, rose from 280,000 to 310,000, and then struggled within 300,000. 4 million were traded. Compared to the previous close, Type A and B were down 4,000 yuan, Type C and D were up 3,000 yuan, and Type E was flat.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Banking Bureau Issues Order: Stop Handling Cash Transfers from the 4th</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beijing, 5th] The Tianjin Banking Bureau issued an order to stop handling cash transfers from the 4th. This is because too much cash is flowing south, and to prevent the reduction of chips at the front end.</p>
<h3>Loose Capital, Strong Buying Interest: Active Trading of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw very active trading by local customers due to the loosening of capital. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened high at 16 million yuan. As fellow traders had ample funds, their purchasing interest was strong, and the market gradually rose to close at 344 million yuan. The other coarse and fine yarns, such as Shuiyutiannv, 40-count, 32-count, 20-count, and 16-count, all rose by 8 million to 9 million to 16.7 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw the continued arrival of speculative capital in Shanghai, the market's capital remained abundant, and there were also rumors of favorable buying opportunities. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at the market and rose by another 300,000 yuan. Upon hearing that the Textile Construction Company suddenly opened sales of Dragon Head cloth with a hanging sign, the market hovered firmly. By the closing, Hankou and Shanxi traders were fiercely competing to buy, and the market rose to 7.98 million yuan. Then, due to fellow traders selling to realize profits, it ultimately returned slightly to close at 7.95 million yuan, up another 500,000 yuan from the previous day. Under the replenishment of dye houses, mid-range fine cloth also rose by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The market for other cloths was also firm and stable.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Prosper</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market saw another increase. No. 120 Gold Three Horses had a good sign, opening at 440 million yuan. Due to the loosening of capital and strong buying interest, the spot price immediately rose to 510 million yuan at noon. The quoted price for the Monday term was 540 million yuan. The off-market market softened slightly in the afternoon, with the selling price quoted at 500 million yuan. As a result, it was up by a large 14 million yuan from the previous day.</p>

<h3>Bristles Stand Out</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] It is reported that since the implementation of the new exchange settlement method, the domestic price of bristles has increased by an average of about 20%. The rumor from the outside world that it has increased by 50% is not true. Before the new method, Shanghai No. 17 bristles were about 220 million yuan per picul. Currently, it is about 250 million yuan, and about 200 piculs have been traded. Hankou No. 17 bristles were about 300 million yuan before, and are now sold at 370 million yuan, with 600 sets having been traded. Chongqing No. 27 bristles were 200 million yuan before, and are now 260 million yuan, with about 800 piculs having been traded. Tianjin Da 55 bristles were 900 million yuan before, and are now 1.1 billion yuan, with about 400 boxes having been traded.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Cocoon Shops Stop Weighing: Fresh Cocoons Exceed Price Limit, Suspension of Agricultural Loan Payments</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 4th] Since the opening of cocoon shops in the countryside on the 3rd, cocoon farmers have been holding back, unwilling to sell. This has caused the price of fresh cocoons to exceed 30 million per picul, a significant difference from the協道會 (Association) limited price of 26 million. On the afternoon of the 4th, all 102 cocoon shops in the county that were granted loans stopped weighing because the 協導會 (Association) and the China Farmers' Bank suspended loan payments, making it impossible to collect cocoons. That night at 8:00 PM, relevant parties from the 協導會 (Association) and the Cocoon Shop Association held an emergency meeting and decided to request the authorities to continue the loans. The manufacturers will temporarily try to pay the excess. If the authorities do not approve this method, weighing will continue to be suspended on the 5th. This matter has attracted widespread attention.</p>
<h3>After Adopting the Method of Exchange Settlement Certificates: Suggestions from the Bristle Industry</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the exchange settlement certificate policy, the difficulties faced by export industries have not been completely resolved. The Shanghai Bristle Export Association specifically submitted requests to the Export Control Commission and the National Bank yesterday, seeking remedies. Regarding the difficulties, the association pointed out:</p>
<p>(1) The validity period of the exchange settlement certificates is too short, the demand is insufficient, and they cannot be sold smoothly. Moreover, the selling price is decreasing daily, while the black market exchange rate still exists. After a temporary decline, it has rebounded sharply, exceeding the sum of the official rate and the certificate price by more than one-third. As for the domestic prices of export commodities, they already exceed the overseas selling prices by a large margin. Since the announcement of the new policy, the prices of all goods in producing areas have soared, making costs exceptionally high and unmanageable. Because commodity prices have long followed the black market, if the exchange rate cannot approach the black market rate, there is no hope for promoting exports.</p>
<p>(2) After the increase in commodity prices in producing areas, exporters need even more capital. However, designated banks still provide packing loans at 70% of the official rate, which, combined with the commodity prices in producing areas, only amounts to 30% of the value. Exporters must advance 70%. Under the dual pressure of high commodity prices and tight credit, where can such enormous strength come from to continue purchasing goods in producing areas? It is inevitable to significantly tighten operations or face a standstill.</p>
<p>(3) Under the flexible exchange rate policy, exporters could still roughly calculate costs when purchasing goods and decide on the timing of shipment and exchange settlement to barely cover costs when selling. Now, the official rate can be changed at any time, and the selling price of the certificates is not known in advance. With these two unknowns, even if the goods have been shipped, it is impossible to predict the proceeds. For example, if a batch of goods is ready to be shipped, and exchange settlement is done based on the official rate, but the official rate rises again before the certificate is sold, causing the market price of the certificate to fall, the magnitude of unexpected losses for that batch of goods is not difficult to imagine. Exporters must take these two risks, making it even more difficult to develop business.</p>
<p>Regarding hopes for improvement:</p>
<p>1. The validity period of the exchange settlement certificate is limited to only seven days, making the timing urgent and the target hard to find, especially at the beginning of the new policy. There are not many import licenses for importers. The procedures of designated banks are not ready, the supply and demand situation is unclear, and the standard of market prices is not determined. Everyone is watching. Even if there are transactions at this time, they are very few and far from fair and reasonable prices, resulting in a large difference from the market price outside the circle. To express their support for the new policy and maintain overseas credit by shipping on schedule, members of the association have enthusiastically settled exchanges on the date of the policy announcement, amounting to a considerable sum. The certificates will expire in a short time and cannot be sold to date. It is requested that before the supply and demand reach equilibrium, the market price cannot be determined daily by the designated bank, and before repurchase at any time, the time limit be temporarily extended to one month, and then the appropriate time limit be determined based on actual needs.</p>
<p>2. The main purpose of the new method is to allow the selling price of the exchange settlement certificate to find its level in the market to reach a price that suits the actual situation. It should be allowed to develop fully and naturally, and artificial manipulation should not be used to change the parity rate at any time, so as to repeat the mistakes before the reform and lose the spirit of the new method. Moreover, the dual exchange rate will further deepen the stimulation of commodity prices and increase the risk of exporters. This layer should be clearly announced to reassure people.</p>
<p>3. Packing loans should be made by notifying the designated banks to change the total amount of the parity rate and the approximate price of the certificate, and lend at 70%, which is still rediscounted by the Central Bank. The term is proposed to be two months, so that traders have sufficient time and financial resources to purchase goods in the producing areas.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] After two days of competition, the third joint sports meet of colleges and universities in this city successfully closed yesterday.

The runner-up in the men's group was Tongji University, and Soochow University and Jiaotong University won the third and fourth places respectively.

<h3>Two Relay Races Tense and Exciting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the most intense events were still the two relay races in the university group. In the men's 1,600-meter relay, St. John's Jiang Weiliang took the lead in the first leg, exceeding the rest by three meters. Soochow University's Xu Zuyuan gradually caught up in the second leg, and Sun Jiawen continued the effort in the third leg, maintaining the lead. Jiaotong University's Wang Nancun also caught up to second place. In the last leg, Yang Yongfang, the 400-meter champion of Soochow University, left the dust behind, breaking the record held by the school with a time of three minutes and fifty-three seconds and six tenths. St. John's, relying on the efforts of Lai Hui'er in the last leg, surpassed Jiaotong University's Liu Zhenzhong within the last twenty meters, winning the runner-up. Jiaotong University was third, and Tongji University was fourth.</p>
<p>In the women's 400-meter relay of the university group, St. John's and Soochow University gave their best efforts, and the competition was no less intense than the men's race the previous day. St. John's still relied on the final sprint to overwhelm Soochow University. In the first leg, St. John's Li Jiaqiao, Soochow University's Wu Anqing, and Great China's Zhang Gui ran side by side, finishing simultaneously. Soochow University had more practice and was skilled in the baton exchange. Chu Bingyi relied on this leg to surpass St. John's Guan Shixian slightly. In the third leg, St. John's Feng Puzheng caught up to a tie, arriving at the same time as Soochow University's Zeng Chaoqun. In the last leg, Soochow University took the lead again with a hotter baton exchange. Li Miao desperately chased, but Wang Shan was not weak either, holding on until the last ten meters. Li Miao finally relied on her extraordinary stamina and ran shoulder to shoulder with Wang Shan. At the finish line, Li Miao leaped with all her might, winning the championship by half a step, with a score of one minute and one second and two tenths, breaking the college record of one minute and two seconds and nine tenths created by Soochow University.</p>

<h3>Small Scenes</h3>
<p>Lixin's female generals performed very well in the college group. President Pan Xulun personally came to encourage morale until the conference was about to end.</p>
<p>Tongji's Mai Mingda, the champion of the 400-meter hurdles, suddenly dropped a shoe after jumping over the third hurdle. Mai Jun ignored everything and continued to run forward, which is commendable.</p>
<p>The cheerleading squads were out in force yesterday. In addition to St. John's and Soochow University, there was also a new force from Lixin. St. John's cheerleading squad also invited an assistant instructor from the Department of Chemistry to lead the team, adding a lot of color.</p>
<p>The cheerleading slogan that was most appreciated by the audience was the "flowing lyrics": "The flowing water stops on the mountain, then flows down the mountain, top notch!". Ms. Qian Hangsu, a senior hurdler, was also watching the game yesterday. The athlete who became popular in the previous National Games is now a teacher at Jinan University and the Sports College.</p>
<p>Wang Nancun, a long-distance runner from Jiaotong University, was the last leg of the torch relay for the Seventh National Games to arrive at the venue. Yesterday, when Wang ran the last lap of the 5,000-meter final, applause rang out. Wang had a hundred times the courage. His popularity among the audience was no less than that of Lou Wen'ao, the deaf-mute runner.</p>
<p>The cheerleading squads of St. John's, Soochow University, and Lixin were initially very competitive. As the closing was approaching, they turned enemies into friends and supported each other. St. John's first shouted: "Soochow is good, Soochow is wonderful, Soochow Soochow is great!". Lixin also shouted: "St. John's is good, Lixin is good, everyone is good!"</p>
<p>The female athlete No. 434 of Soochow University was praised by students from St. John's and Soochow University as the flower of the conference, and she was inseparable from the male athlete No. 57, so the latter was also honored with the elegant title of "Prince of the Conference".</p>
<p>On the individual side, the strongman Bao Lai still won the triathlon championship. Since the beginning of the college sports meet, the triathlon championship has been regarded as a forbidden area by Bao Lai, and no one has ever been allowed to get involved, which is also rare.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University's Wang Nancun won the 800-meter, 1,500-meter, and 5,000-meter middle-distance championships, replacing Soochow University's Lin Canran from the previous session, and is tied for first place with Bao Lai. They rival each other. (Chang Xin)</p>

<h3>Hang Liwu Discusses Anti-Americanism at Jinling University Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Expresses Regret for the Actions of St. John's University Students</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th] Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, delivered a speech at the board meeting of Jinling University in Nanjing on the morning of the 5th, stating: "I would like to take this opportunity to describe the abnormal anti-American brewing in recent years. This matter lacks a normal reason and damages Sino-American friendship. The excuse of the anti-Americans is that the United States' policy towards Japan is too generous, which is enough to promote an industrialized Japan and threaten China and world peace. This point is not correct, because the entire reparations issue and the procedures by which Japan will be allowed to industrialize are still under careful consideration by the Far Eastern Commission. Even the so-called Dreep and St. Hanssen reports are not official documents accepted by the US government. Secondly, we must remember our country's established two-sided policy towards Japan, that is, to strictly prevent the resurgence of a militant and aggressive Japan, while at the same time adopting a tolerant and far-sighted policy to allow Japan to live and trade peacefully. We believe that this is also the common policy adopted by other United Nations, including the United States. The current measures taken by the United States in Japan are completely consistent with the policies it pursues in Europe and the Far East, that is, to assist war-damaged countries to revive self-help. Unless we are willing to adopt revengeism and force the Japanese people to take risks, we should not object to this policy. In view of the long and sincere traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, it is regrettable to allow the anti-American sentiment, which is mainly caused by incitement, to spread with such excuses, especially in St. John's University, which is established by the church. Moreover, the cultural relationship between China and the United States and the contribution of the United States to Chinese education have always been the source of friendship between the two countries. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful for the cooperation and assistance of the United States, and should not allow Sino-American relations to be damaged by irresponsible actions."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing 5th] Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, said in a speech to the board of directors of Jinling University today; It is especially regrettable that anti-American sentiment has spread to church schools, such as St. John's University in Shanghai. According to well-informed sources: Hang's speech was actually made with the consent of Foreign Minister Wang.</p>

<h3>Wen Zhaotong: New Topics in Art Education</h3>
<p>For the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Art Education Society</p>
<p>History tells us that art education is not a new thing. "Zhou Shangwen, the rituals and music were prepared for the systems of the four dynasties, and the sound and teaching of cultural relics were called flourishing." In the West, Plato's art education thought was popular in the era more than two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>However, in the 20th century, in the atomic age today, and in China, which has a long historical tradition of art education, why should we promote art education and improve art education?</p>
<p>The reason is of course simple, because today's China does not pay enough attention to art education, and it is suffocating art education. We might as well look at the following many facts:</p>
<p>Everyone feels the headache of "comic books" is something that must be banned, and must be improved. The government has repeatedly ordered and prohibited it, but it is still at large. Recently, the Teacher Welfare Association of the Municipal Schools of this city had a surprising analysis in the Research and Development Work Exhibition to tell everyone:</p>
<p>(1) "Comic Books" began to be published in the fifth year of the Republic of China and have now been sold all over the country and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>(2) It is estimated that there are 1,000 rental stalls in this city, with an average of 80 readers per stall per day, totaling 80,000 per day. If each person is charged a rental fee of 5,000 yuan, the total daily consumption on "comic books" is 400 million yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Its content: The characters are: ghosts and gods, wizards and diviners, warriors and knights, local tyrants and bullies. The form is: incomprehensible text, distorted records, and ugly pictures. The ideology is: ghosts and gods reward and punish, impartial and selfless, find good feng shui, and future generations will surely prosper.</p>
<p>Please look at the school: art class, crafts class, mostly teach children to imitate adults, imitate established methods, some schools even cancel these point embellishment nature of the subjects, the UK is considered to be able to be promoted to school.</p>
<p>Anyone who cares about art teachers says that there is a lack of teachers. Therefore, training art teachers is regarded as a necessary proposal on the meeting table. But how to train? What kind of training to be? Few people have considered it. Moreover, are the existing art teachers not changing careers? Are they not unemployed?</p>
<p>There are too many erroneous and contradictory phenomena like the above, it's really innumerable. We are art educators, we want to correct these errors and eliminate these contradictions. This is actually like the current "eliminating illiteracy", just sweeping here, there is illiteracy again.</p>
<p>I am not pessimistic, we always focus on traditional art education, and art education itself will not develop upward. It can be said that even the above-mentioned erroneous and contradictory evil forces cannot be resisted. Not to mention correcting and eliminating it, but on the contrary, maintaining its survival.</p>
<p>Because most art educators are still dreaming of the artistic views and educational views of the scholar-official class. This is the traditional thought at work, but also the inevitable ideological reflection of the traditional old society, and "comic books" "imitation education" "promotion education" are a pack, and are unified in nature.</p>
<p>The new topic of art education in China today is the need to transform the consciousness of art education workers themselves. They should quickly accept the guidance of realistic aesthetics and democratic educational philosophy, and then transform the essence of art education, and use the power of art education to promote social progress. When our country throws off the heavy shackles of external and self-imposed shackles and stands freely and independently on the world, art education will certainly have a broader, deeper, and more rational power to express itself.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Remembering "Fu Manchu"</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Dr. Fu Manchu, a man of extreme height, abnormally thin, with a pale complexion, slender fingers, fingernails exceeding an inch in length, eyes gleaming with a green light, addicted to opium, with an exceptionally rich intellect, mysterious and unpredictable in his behavior, fond of probing into secrets, with accomplices spread across the globe, frequently engaging in murder and smuggling... and one more thing: he is Chinese!</p>
<p>However, he does not exist. He is merely a character in the novels of the American detective fiction writer Sax Rohmer. His name should be Fu Manchu, and "傅曼殊" (Fu Manchu) is my translation of it.</p>
<p>Rohmer's "Grotesque Horror Detective Novels" (to borrow a phrase from cinema advertisements) have been published in dozens of editions and sell extremely well, ranking prominently among the most popular detective novels. And the protagonist of each novel is always this mad "scholar" who commits all kinds of evil: Fu Manchu. Recently, since May 8th, the American "Collier's Weekly" has once again begun serializing a "Fu Manchu novel." Fu Manchu is practically immortal.</p>
<p>I have read two or three hundred detective novels written by British and American authors, and whenever I encounter Fu Manchu, I feel deeply uncomfortable, as if smelling the foul water of the Suzhou Creek while crossing the Sichuan Road Bridge in the sweltering summer heat—it's simply nauseating. However, I think we should also reflect on ourselves.</p>
<p>What does Fu Manchu represent? He is base, treacherous, greedy, and cruel. If we read more works by Europeans and Americans, we can probably still find many traces of suspicion towards the Chinese in the words between the lines, right? Chinatown is always mysterious because China itself is unfathomable; therefore, they often use the word "Inscrutable" to describe China. As for Fu Manchu's extraordinary intellect and sophisticated methods, they symbolize a foreign perception of China's millennia-old civilization, as if saying: "They are truly remarkable—but I still can't make heads or tails of them."</p>
<p>In all fairness, I don't think that Rohmer, the creator of "Fu Manchu," necessarily intended to portray the Chinese as such a dreadful figure. I think Rohmer is just an ordinary, average American. Maybe he happened to see a few paintings of Chinese court ladies (how long those fingernails are!), wanted to add some exotic flair to his novels, and at the same time, he had read some books about the Boxers. Thus, the long fingernails were there, the drawing of talismans and hand gestures were there, the moving of mountains and overturning of seas were there, and the invulnerability to guns was there—plus a "doctorate" to show respect (?!), and Dr. Fu Manchu was born.</p>
<p>He may not have intended to "disrespect" the Chinese, just as Huang Zuolin didn't necessarily think he would offend all the barbers in the country when he wrote "Fake Phoenixes Courting." However, the bad thing is that the "Fu Manchu novels" sell very well, reaching the hands of many ordinary American people who are similar to Rohmer—the result is probably not going to be good for China; just as Hollywood movies about outlaws like Jesse James and Dillinger would not create a good impression in China.</p>
<p>If China and the United States want to talk about cooperation, then first of all, we must seek mutual understanding between the people of the two countries. This responsibility is mutual, and we should also take responsibility and tell people that although China is not paradise now, bound feet and queues have already disappeared, and elderly Chinese people don't necessarily like to grow Fu Manchu mustaches, and they certainly don't allow the mustaches to expand indefinitely to the left and right, turning into two wisps of rat whiskers. Although the Chinese emphasize precociousness, they are not all necessarily harboring sinister intentions. In short, "Fu Manchu" can "die"!</p>
<p>Seeing "Fake Phoenixes Courting" going abroad, especially the news that this film has been dubbed in English, I am very happy. This is China, this is the Chinese people! Look, isn't Shi Hui humorous? Isn't Li Lihua beautiful? How are the Chinese mysterious? Where is the shadow of that deadly "Fu Manchu"?</p>
<p>However, on the other hand. If an American friend in Shanghai points to the stone figures at the racecourse and asks me: "You said the Chinese are not mysterious, very true, very true. I just want to ask you: when did that pair of stone figures become immortals?" How can I answer him!</p>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>When King Henry VIII of England was in power, there was a pastor in the country who hired a cook named Richard Roose. Unexpectedly, Roose was a beast in human form, and he poisoned two members of the pastor's family to death. Henry VIII was furious when he heard about this matter. Because the cook was skilled in cooking, he issued an edict to build a large pot, hung it high, and placed a large pile of firewood burning fiercely underneath. He ordered Roose to be "cooked" in the pot and burned to death alive. According to historical records, the cook screamed miserably in the pot for a full hour. When he died, his entire body was bright red, and his hair resembled a large red prawn, it is said.</p>
<h3>Iron Lung Hospital</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>When people talk about iron lung patients, the Chinese immediately think of Farrad Schnyder, who suddenly contracted polio in Beiping before the war. Schnyder is just one of the iron lung patients. There are many other iron lung patients scattered around the world, and the concentration of iron lung patients is in the newly established "Respiratory Center Station" at the Children's Hospital in Baltimore, USA. Here, nine adults and teenagers lie individually in iron lungs, using the pulsation of the iron lung to support their breathing and lives.</p>
<p>They have one advantage over solitary iron lung patients: they are not lonely. They have become a group, encouraging each other, comforting each other, and keeping each other company. They cultivate confidence. Although getting out of the iron lung seems far away, it is not without hope.</p>
<p>Iron lung patients are the most tragic victims of polio and are the most difficult to treat. In these patients, the respiratory muscles are often paralyzed in the same way as the hands and feet. They must lie flat on their backs in a huge iron machine. Air is pressed into the interior of this machine, replacing the weakened muscles in performing respiratory work. Iron lung patients truly lose the freedom of movement, and their field of vision is also limited. They can only see the scenery reflected in the mirror hanging in front of their eyes on the iron lung.</p>
<p>The "Respiratory Center Station" was founded in June 1946 by the "National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis" of the Maryland Pastoral Association, and is supervised and managed by Dr. George Barnard. Its purpose is twofold: first, iron lung patients need 24-hour care a day. Living together with nine people is more economical than living alone, and it can prevent them from feeling lonely and sad psychologically; second, this facilitates complete clinical experiments—both medically and psychologically.</p>
<h3>More on Inksticks</h3>
<p>— Semi-Dreaming Old Man</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the method of making inksticks has always been to take soot or pine resin, mix it with benzoin and storax, add castor oil and deer horn for glue, pound it tens of thousands of times with a mortar and pestle, and melt it into a ball. It is then molded into cakes or ingots. The best are those that are as hard as stone and have a black and shiny color when ground. Those considered the best throughout the ages are the Xu Xuan Moon Round, the Tang Xuanzong Dragon Fragrance, and the Li Tinggui Dragon Pattern Double Ridge.</p>
<p>The new ink produced today is best in Huizhou, such as that from Hu Kaiwen, Cao Sugong, Zhan Dayou, etc. The soot used for raw materials is all purchased from overseas, mostly accumulated ash from factory chimneys, which is coarse, heavy, and light in color. The glue is also not as good as what was used before. The so-called top soot or five hundred catties of oil on the ink surface are also not real. It is difficult to prevent the deterioration of manufacturing methods with this. Calligraphers and painters do not use new ink but seek ancient ink, which is also due to this.</p>
<p>I saw a type of Li Tinggui ink on display at the Old Palace Exhibition Hall. The ink box was engraved with the "Record of the Ink Cloud Studio" made by Emperor Gaozong of Qing, which stated, "Bi Yuan presented an ancient inkstick, one foot long, two inches wide, and two-tenths of an inch thick, the box engraved with Chao's record, believed to be from Monk Fayi's collection, the item of Li Tinggui of the Southern Tang." There was also an ancient ink song written by Dong Zhelin: "The ink jade is one foot long, the jade is hard, and the ink is brittle. With the hardness of jade and the goodness of ink, it is rare to see this Tinggui production. From the Five Dynasties to today, it has been nearly a thousand years, Fayi's collection, Chao's record, its shape, engraving, and description are recorded in detail. The wind and moon of the Hanlin can be vaguely identified, the whole body is full of thick clouds brewing rain, and this spring's sweet rain benefits agriculture, returning to the earth with spiritual blessings. Yan Liu and Wei Dan only spread their names, who recognizes the Wei ball and Jin snail, Su Shi once commented on tea and ink; virtue and integrity are like good scholars. The oak box and brocade pouch are heavily stored, how can the dragon guest bear to have Concubine Zhao test it, then self-conscious and self-deprecating; the traveler mastiff plays with objects to praise virtue, what is the point of treasuring talents without employing them, and feeling ashamed to store the ruler for too long." This is the poem first sung by Emperor Gaozong of Qing. The record also stated, "The ministers were ordered to harmonize it according to their own ideas, without having to adhere to the style and rhyme, it is also a beautiful story of the West Lake," the ink is as solid as jade, with patterns like rhinoceros horn, said to be made by mixing twelve items such as gamboge, rhinoceros horn, pearl, and croton, truly a priceless treasure.</p>
<p>Li Tinggui's ink has never been discontinued. The ink with the inscription "邽" (Gui) on it is the best, the one with "圭" (Gui) is the next best, the one with "珪" (Gui) is again the next best, and the one with "奚廷珪" (Xi Tinggui) is the worst. Tinggui's original surname was Xi, and he was later granted the surname Li, which I have described before. The Essentials of Antiquity states, "Li Tinggui's ink has two grades, the one with dragon patterns and double ridges is the best, and the one with a single ridge is the next best." However, it is not often seen, and the manufacturing method has been lost. Other ink makers have not been able to match it.</p>
<p>Zhou Gaoshenfu wrote "Qing Shang Jian," using four-character phrases to discuss ink: "The wonder of ink, its substance should be light, its soot should be blue, it should have no fragrance when smelled, it should have no sound when ground, new inkstone and new water, it should be ground effortlessly. (It is said that it cannot be ground with force.) Avoid haste and heat, heat makes it raw, use the inkstone to rotate, the inkstone should not be left for a long time, dust and grime pollute the ink, and the glue becomes muddy. Wash it after use, and do not let the ink accumulate too much, the glue will age after being stored for a long time, and the ink will be refined when used." This speaks specifically about using ink, not about storing ink. The purposes of those who use ink and those who store ink are different. Users do not need to talk about storing, and storers do not need to talk about using. But storing without using, how can you know the beauty of the ink? Beauty is not in the appearance of the ink. But if it is stored for too long, then the intention of grinding it for use will also naturally be exhausted, and it is better to keep it as a plaything.</p>
<p>Among the three inksticks of the Lingxiaohan Pavilion, which was destroyed, and the hundred scenic inksticks of the Mountain Resort, and one of the five hundred Arhat inksticks of Qianlong, most were made in the Qing Dynasty. I used to have two circular jade pendant-shaped inksticks made in the Ming Dynasty, which were lost in the chaos of the Japanese pirates. Only a Heart Sutra inkstick made in the Qing Dynasty remains in my traveling trunk, one side engraved with the entire Heart Sutra, and the other side engraved with a statue of Sakyamuni Buddha, with the four seal characters "Original Face" written on it, and a note stating that it was made by Subida, prepared for writing scriptures. Speaking of collection, my interest has not yet reached, and my strength has not yet attained. Li Tinggui was proficient in making ink and also skilled in poetry, which people do not know. His poem says: "I give you a black jade pendant, the clear spring inkstone must be clean, hang the Ge bag to avoid the summer heat, and pass the plum moon in the wind," which is beyond what Fang Yulu and Luo Xiaohua could achieve.</p>
<h3>Fighting Yellow Birds</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>This newspaper reported that the Shanghai Shicun Society held a great yellow bird fight at the City God Temple in Nanshi, gathering nine hundred birds, paired into four hundred and fifty pairs, divided into groups for fighting, with crowds of spectators, which was very lively. Readers of this news may regret not having gone to see the grand event, or say that this should not be done at this time of crisis. Now, based on what I know, I will talk about yellow birds.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to find a bird with good fighting talent. Among these nine hundred birds, I don't know how much selection and elimination it took to get to this point. I heard that the method of selecting birds is to first look at the bird's eyes, then look at the bird's feathers, and then look at the bird's body. Those with bright eyes are not chaotic in battle, and every attack hits the mark, and they are also good at defending against the enemy, leaving the enemy with no chance to take advantage of, as the saying goes, "A general's pair of eyes frightens the enemy." Those with hard feathers can still fight more and more bravely, and will eventually win, even if they suffer heavy blows. Those with strong bodies have enough strength and power, and can definitely endure battles. The method of catching birds is to set up nets to trap them in winter. These birds fly low in the winter, gathering in thorny bushes. Set up nets nearby and startle the birds to make them fly into the net, and they can be caught. In spring, they often fly high, so it is advisable to lure them with cages. Hang the cage in the shade of a tree, with multiple doors open inside. The doors are equipped with mechanisms, and a bird is kept closed in the cage to attract them; the birds are lured and fly into the cage door, and as soon as they step on the mechanism, the door closes and they cannot get out. However, when encountering good birds, they come to find a fight. Their momentum is fierce and they tend to peck at the birds in the cage, so the cage birds must be carefully selected. Weak birds are always scared back by the birds that come, and dare not speak, or even fly wildly in the cage in extreme fright, which cannot lure good birds into the cage. It must be a bird that can be fought with in order to not be suppressed by the birds that come, and can lure good birds, but it is not possible to fill it with old birds that are good at fighting, because their fighting power is strong and their fighting momentum is strong, so the birds that come are afraid and dare not enter, and bird keepers do not want to put good birds in the cage of lure birds, because this cage is most likely to ruin the birds. As for the bird's fighting methods, in short, it is nothing more than the head and feet. What is meant by the head? That is, being good at pecking at the enemy's head. When two birds approach each other, both sides peck at each other and avoid each other. Those with bright eyes, quick beaks, and age always peck at the enemy's head, causing them to lose feathers and bleed. When the enemy pecks back, they can skillfully avoid it, making them miss. When the enemy bird is repeatedly pecked painfully, their mind is flustered, and they take the opportunity to advance quickly, extending their feet to tightly embrace the enemy bird's head. At this time, the enemy bird has been captured, unable to break free, and its head is under its beak, allowing it to peck at will, the head feathers are all gone, the flesh and blood are a mess, and even the eyes are blinded and the neck is disabled, so they can only mourn and escape. This fighting method is commonly known as "embracing the head and opening," and cannot be achieved by those who do not have bright eyes, quick bodies, and thick strength. What is meant by the feet? That is, specializing in taking the enemy's feet to win. Taking advantage of gaps, they quickly drag the enemy's feet across the silk, and when the enemy's feet are dragged, their head and body are overturned behind them, unable to peck forward. In severe cases, they take the opportunity to drag again, and occupy the enemy's feet with their body and claws. At this time, the enemy's feet are all captured, and it is impossible to break free by struggling, allowing the feet to be pecked open, and the skin and flesh are all removed. Those who are severely injured can hardly stand on the cage frame, and often fall to the bottom of the cage. This fighting method wins with skill, and bright eyes and quick claws are also its special strengths. In general, those who are good at the head inevitably suffer from the feet, and those who are good at the feet inevitably lose to the head. Heroes who are good at fighting have difficulty winning against strong enemies. Ever-victorious generals often suffer setbacks due to old age, and there are those who are known to be good at fighting but suddenly collapse when they encounter an enemy. This is related to the art of raising them, causing them to have diseases that cannot be known, so the bird's victory or defeat is greatly related to the bird's body fatness and whether the feeding is good.</p>
<h3>Two Recent Poems</h3>

<p>The beacon fires of war pass before the eyes,</p>
<p>The landscape is without proclamations and my headache grows worse,</p>
<p>I want to ask Wang Wei with a sad heart.</p>
<p>Where can joy be found without fighting?</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The terms "Golden World" and "Golden Age" both express extreme prosperity, one in terms of space and the other in terms of time. The preciousness of gold has been unanimously agreed upon throughout ancient and modern times, in China and abroad, precisely because its nature has the highest monetary value. However, in old China, even as recently as the late Qing Dynasty, copper coins were still used as currency; as for silver, only large official items, valuable goods, and special items were valued in silver. (Han Gong in *Zhu Sha Zhi* said to Wu Sheng, "Above all things, silver is a good thing, a treasure." Truly a common sentiment.) But silver was not really currency, its shape was either round ingots or loose chunks, and it was always necessary to use weighing instruments when using it, and the weighing instruments were of various kinds, which was extremely troublesome. (In Wang Tangchun's play, Su San confessed that in the darkness of the night, there was no balance or scale, and with a hand weigh, it was only three hundred taels. Luckily it was a gift to someone, if it were to buy something, it would have to be weighed.) Silver dollars were imported goods from the middle and late Qing Dynasty, used from southern China, so later Chinese-made ones were also commonly called "foreign money," and silver became currency. Furthermore, Su San recounted that the young Master Wang brought three hundred taels of silver the first time he entered the house, and left after drinking a cup of fragrant tea, which surprised the officials on the stand with his generosity. Su San also confessed that he brought thirty-six thousand taels of silver the second time, and it was all spent in less than a year, which greatly shocked the officials on the stand, who questioned, "Could it be that you eat silver and wear silver?" So Su San opened up and reported her expenses: gold basins and jade bowls, brocade gardens, ten thousand flower pavilions, many projects, all enough to show the extravagance of the thirty thousand taels of silver. Silver is already like this, how much more so is gold! Lu Sheng in *Deyi Lu* says, "A man has gold under his knees," and then laughs and says, "My legs are made of gold," although they are all lines from a play, it is enough to reflect that gold at that time was only a standard precious object, and for practical use, it was even rarer than silver, so even "balances and scales" were rarely disturbed. Yu Boya in the Ma'anshan play uses "two ingots of gold" to give a generous pension to the old father of Zhong Ziqi, which is occasionally seen in play scripts.</p>
<p>In ancient times, gold was called "several ingots" (like ancient ink), and also called "錠" (ding, ingot). Now, it is often called "several bars" (each bar ten taels), like cigarettes. Each cigarette bar has ten boxes, and each box has twenty cigarettes. This is also an American-style trend since the victory. In the past, ten cigarettes were common, and twenty were also occasionally available, and large boxes had five hundred cigarettes in a whole box, and two hundred and fifty cigarettes in half a box. Now, in addition to bars, there are also large cases. Cigarette bars seem to be more convenient than boxes in the past. Gold bars also seem a bit more modern than the "笏" (hu, scepter) or "large ingots" of the past. This is not a matter of great importance, but many transactions and entrances and exits, as well as the ill-gotten wealth of corrupt officials and the black market operations of unscrupulous merchants, often involve several or dozens of bars (or roots), which is a modern trend, and even more obvious. The old-style worship of gold and the new-style "spending of gold" have merged into one, which has become a deformed state of a "bar" or "root" society.</p>
