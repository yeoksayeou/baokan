<h3 id="c24">法國馬里內閣的組成 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>當柏林的冷戰打得火熱的時候，法國許曼內閣突然垮台了，使遠在海　出席西歐五國外長會議的皮杜爾外長，也不得不提前返國，不論從那一個角度去觀察，法國的閣潮總是加深歐洲局勢不安定的一大因素；但法國政局經過一星期的動盪，終因急進社會黨領袖馬里組閣吿成而趨於穩定了。不論對法國本身言，或對整個歐洲言，馬里新閣的組成，都是一件令人欣慰的事情。</p>
<p>這次許曼內閣垮台的原因，從表面上看，由於國防預算問題，許曼總理及其領導的人民共和黨所提出的國防經費是十　一千七百萬美元，但是社會黨和急進社會黨則主張削减一千七百萬美元，國民議會竟於十九日晚通過此一削减國防預算案，許曼內閣爲避免舉行普選起見，不待議會通過不信任案，就宣佈內閣總辭職。但是透視法國政治的內幕，許曼內閣的垮台，與其說是由於國防預算的被削减，母寗說是由於許曼內閣外交的失敗所致。自倫敦六國會議締結西德協定之後，法國朝野對於英美的「扶德政策」，無不發生疑懼，代表法國簽字的皮杜爾外長的聲名，從此也就狼藉不堪；許曼內閣雖因國民議會的免强批准而度過難關，但在法國人民心目中的地位，却從此開始動搖了，這次垮台，可謂法國政局演變必然的結果。</p>
<p>內閣更迭，在民主國家本是家常便飯，尤其是在法國，內閣更迭頻繁，在一個月內更換幾個內閣，也是屢見不鮮的；但是現在我們爲什麼要特別重視這次內閣的更迭呢？說起來，理由也非常簡單，依照法國現行憲法的規定，若有兩屆政府連續爲議會通過不信任案所推翻，即須舉行全國普選；而左蠶共產黨與右蠶戴高樂派，對於利用普選以奪取政權，早已躍勵欲試；法國共產黨久有掌握政權的野心，姑置勿論；且就戴高樂派而言，戴氏於七月十九日在巴黎演說，他也公然說：「人民結集運動全國大會，應擬訂立即可實施之施政網領，蓋不久即有此需要，法國必須由人民結集運動出而領導」。同時並提出四項主張：（一）以「協會」解決社會問題；（二）以法蘭西聯邦解決殖民地問題；（三）以歐洲聯邦對付蘇聯的威脅歐洲；（四）以改組政府解救國內的危機。</p>
<p>但以目前法國在歐洲所處地位及其實際需要而言，不論是左異共產黨，或是右翼戴高樂派，都不是法國所需要的；換句話說，左右兩派的執政，對於國家民族，都是有百害而無一利的。所以法國朝野在人民共和黨的許曼內閣垮台之後，均希望法國仍能保持着走中間路綫的政府。當歐禮和總統與社會黨元老勃魯姆會商內閣總理繼任人選時，就屬意於急進社會黨領袖即前任司法部長馬里，他們的理由是：「如以急進社會黨之人出任內閣總理，可以削滅一般人對於戴高樂運動得勢的恐懼。」誰都知道，法國急進社會然是名不符實的，名義上雖稱急進社會黨，但其實際還不及社會黨急進。國民議會也以爲組織中間偏右的內閣，當較舉行普選使戴高樂有取得政權機會爲佳，故以三五二對一九〇票的多數，同意馬里爲內閣總理，由其組織新閣。同時社會急進社會暨人民共和三黨，又以馬里的資望，或不能孚國內外的衆望，乃決定由三黨的黨魁，一致參加組織聯合內閣，以增强馬里內閣的地位。新閣名單最惹人注意的，有社會然元老勃魯姆任副總理，獨立共和黨領袖萊諾任財長，人民共和黨領袖戴特香任副總理，社會黨領袖賴瑪迪任不管部閣員，許曼本人也出任外長。如此陣容，當較任何聯合內閣爲豎强，似能應付國內外的困難而有餘。</p>
<p>惟橫在法國面前的問題，却不一而足，其中最感棘手的，一個是法國的外交問題，在西方盟國與蘇聯山間，法國的處境日感困難，中間路綫，在事實上已經走不通，何去何從？實有左右爲難之感。另外一個是法國的經濟問題，因受戰爭的破壞，瘡痍滿目，欲言經濟復興，則非取得外國的援助不可；但在經濟上仰仗他國的援助，在外交上就不得不跟別人走，甚至對於徒有利於德國的西德協定，也不得不免强接受。這種自相矛盾行爲，不僅可爲左翼攻擊的資料，而且也足爲右派反對的理由。馬里首次向國民議會宣佈施政方針時，也以外交政策爲主，而將內政問題置於次要地位，馬里說：「法國在歐洲的地位，應爲時時注意不可從事過份的挑撥，但間時亦應保特堅定的立塲，本人將實行堅定而不從事挑撥的外交政策：（一）對德政策，應以倫敦六國會議之決議爲依據，法國願意德國重新取得其在歐洲的正當地位；但不能因此犧牲其他歐洲國家的利益，本人認爲應乘下屆聯合國大會於九月間在巴黎舉行的機會，謀得德國問題的澈底解決。（二）英法關係，本人以爲，法國必須與英國携手合作，無條件的擁護英法五十年同盟條約。（三）對於美援，法國應知感謝馬歇爾之援歐計劃，但法國仍須準備自助，以便於美援停止後得以自立。</p>
<p>從馬里新總理的報吿看來，馬里內閣仍是許曼內閣的賡續，在本質上找不出不同之點。在歐洲兩極化日益明朋的今日，法國處境益感困難，如何應付雙方？確實是一件艱險的工作，我們瞻望中間偏右的馬里內閣的前途，依舊是不能過分樂觀的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿七日廣播：杜魯門總統今日向美國會特別大會提出七大要網之咨文，請求通過成爲法案。除工資及物價控制外，美總統特別着重國內反通貨膨脹一點，據謂：「此種工作，刻不容緩，蓋通貨膨脹與美國外交政策，實有莫大之聯帶關係也。共產黨深盼美國之繁榮一且變成不景氣。彼等不信我人可阻止物價之上漲，認爲我國經濟崩潰已無法避免。　我國果眞发生不景氣，則世界永久和平之希望，必隨之消逝矣。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕共和黨控制之八十屆　會已於昨日復會，杜魯門總統今提出渠希　付諸實現的十一點具有政治爆炸性之計劃。內中以「反通貨膨脹」及「房屋問題」居首，其他各點包括：（一）聯邦對教育之補助；（二）全國最低工資之增高；（三）社會安全之拓展；（四）修正聯邦公務員之各級俸給；（五）人權法案，（六）移民法之修正計（七）對聯合國永久總部之六千五百萬美貸款；（八）國際小麥協定之批准；（九）電力開墾計劃基金五千八百萬美元之恢復。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國歷史上政治糾紛最尖銳化之議會，已在酷烈之氣氛中開始。共和黨決計反對總統擴大其經濟管制權力，彼等希望杜魯門重提人權法案，蓋此事於本年二月中造成南方民主黨叛動。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕杜魯門總統今日向國會提出咨文，提出十一點之計劃。杜氏要求被渠詆爲「歷史上最壞的一個」國會之特別會議，要求制定物價薪給管制辦法·配給·及過份利得稅。並警告稱，反對通貨膨脹之戰，在大選前不能放　。杜氏又要求通過總括之辦法，以解決全國性房荒。杜氏所列雖有十一點，然渠籲請議員特別着重反膨脹及房荒建議。由於共和黨反對夏季特別會議，杜魯門稱，「高物價不會暫停以觀大選的，高物價也不會等候下屆國會的開幕的，這情形一天比一天壤。」</p>
<p>杜氏所提次要計劃，計有人權計劃，聯邦政府援助教育·提高最低工資·擴展社會安全政策。關係人權，總統朱涉細節，僅稱，願重申二月間所提反私刑及反納投票稅之人權計劃。對黑白兩種人僱用一律平等，各州問交通車輛上黑白不應分席等惡習「我相信，爲了保障憲法之眞確性起見，吾們必須達到我以前提出的各點。我相信，美國人相信自由平等，必須從這一方面去求。」</p>

<p>杜魯門咨文之重要部份如后：「美國人民的迫切需要，使我們今天在這裏開會。我們的人民要求政府提出立法案做兩件事：第一，阻遏通化膨脹和生活代價之上昇，第二，解決房荒。這些事使每一個美國家庭都受到影響。何况世界和平有賴吾國的經濟力量，這些事也影響到世界全部。</p>
<p>「國內外的共黨專等吾國從目前的繁榮跌進不景氣中他們不相信我們會阻止高物價的，他們還巴望美國經濟的崩潰。如果我們不能管制物價，再招來一次不景氣，世界和平的希望也因此給斷送了。歐洲自由國家受累不淺，美國的經濟崩潰將延誤全世界的復興，而這却是和平之所繫。如果發生這悲劇，我們實在是自尸其咎。</p>
<h3 id="c57">物價不斷上漲　人民生活煎熬 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>「在這時候，我們的力量在全世界都受到測騐，要是我們不能制止膨脹，錯得不堪設想。現在的生活代價是歷史上空前的，我們不能够再袖手觀火八個月了，物價高得嚇人，去年美國四分之一的家庭入不數出，低下或中常收入的家庭，所入不够用高價買進多種生活必需品。同時工業價格也在騰漲，有領導全國經濟能力的工業組織，新近又宣布大漲價。如果我們不遏住膨脤，結果產額和派員都要劇減，政府到了那時，也無能爲力了。所以我敦促國會採取堅强積極的行動，來管制通貨膨脹。</p>
<h3 id="c58">遏阻通貨膨脹　採取有效措施 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>「我提出的計劃如下：第一，重行征　過份利得稅充個　　月，打擊膨脹。第二，恢復消費資本管制，壓低膨脹資本。第三，授權聯邦備備局管制膨脹性銀行資本。第四，授欋政府管制物品交易之投機。第五，授權政府分配及調查稀有物品。第六，加强管制房租，且確立妥法以資執行，俾防止房租無理上漲。第七，授權政府必要時配給存貨缺乏而有關人民健康福科之產品。不過這一點照現狀看來，可以不必實行。第八，凡有關主要工業生產或生活代價的稀少物品的價格，一律加以管制。</p>
<p>「跟我再說一次，有很多的臨時　利可以抵消工資增加而不必提高物價。我們應繼續採取自由的合作買賣方式，達到非膨脹性增薪的目的。政府定出限價，限價內的工資調整政府不預備管，不過要是加薪使限價不成立，政府也只好加以限制。</p>
<h3 id="c59">房荒互謀解決　移民法應修正 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>「我召集國會的第二個理由，是人民希望立法應付全國性房荒　。我們急亟需要低價的居屋，讓中等收入的人們，特別是退伍軍人付得起房租。參院法案第八六六號是很好的房屋法案，參院已在四月廿二日通過。我們需要這法案，不過現在就要，不必等到一年後。　杜魯門乃籲請國會立即通過教育計劃及其他社會性策略，又稱：</p>
<p>「關係全世界方面，我們也應立即行動，表示我們心口如一，聽對自由人道和國際和平　　合作具有信心。這就牽涉三種辦法：第一，現行無籍流亡民衆法案在宗教·土翘上說是不很公平的。這法案的規程，全部違反美國的理想，這法案應該立刻修正。鋒外，現法案僅准許二十萬人進美國，我深深覺得這法案該規定四年內　四十萬人入境。</p>
<p>「塲二，世界上很多人說我們一方面拼命擁　聯合國，一方面却不大賞拿錢出　　他念造德部，所以我們應該立即通渦法案，由美國政府貸款在紐約建造聯合國總部。國際小麥協定也是閱會、應該趕緊批准的。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：某外交官員今日稱，英美法三國政府，頃已決定調令三國駐蘇大使，親自向莫洛托夫提出解決柏林危機及其他德國問題之建議。</p>
<p>據稱此種方式，較正式外交上之照會容易取得協議。蓋此學至少可避免另一正式外交折衝之破裂故也。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：英美法三國代表團，已一致完成對蘇聯新答覆之協議。同時對如何應付蘇聯政治攻勢之長期策略一節，亦已一致同意。此項協議雖仍須提交三國政府個別批准。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦敦七日電〕據悉：美，法，英三國高級外交代表在此問幾不斷談判甘四小時之後，今日已對向莫洛托夫口頭提出解決柏林問題之次一建議，獲致初步協議。又悉，若干美官員主張直接向史達林提出，已遭英法兩國反對，蓋英法兩國警告此項行徑將招致攤牌，此非西歐國家所希望者。英政府已決定取消於廿八日全面辯論國際局勢之計劃，蓋目前局勢極爲緊張，貝文外相不信渠將會答覆關於柏林危機之問題，尤其在此間談判對蘇照會之際。消息靈通方面稱，蘇聯新照會全文，今日可準備就緒，但警告稱，在柏林或德國整個問題解決之前，西方盟國必須準備與蘇聯之長期換文。彼等認為；雖則此項換文之結果可能為召開四强會議，然目前不會如此，蓋美國迄未同意。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日電〕杜魯門今日下令以激烈步驟，廢除聯邦政府就業問題以及軍隊中之種族歧視現象。總統以行政命令，主張設立軍隊待遇及機會平等委員會直屬總統，並以另一命令頒佈關於聯邦政府機構中公平就業之規定。南方民主黨員初已持反抗態度，脅稱，如共和黨在特別國會中提出任何人權法案，則南方黨人必將阻擾。杜魯門合頒佈之命令，係先聲奪人，就政網中人權部分內關於公平就業及軍隊中不存歧視等項提出修正，而不待其政敵提出法案。杜魯門稱，軍隊中應維持較高民主標準，平等待遇及機會均等之政策，亦應儘速實行，此固甚爲重要。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林廿七日電〕據一般相信，西方盟國準備在短期內加緊壓榨蘇聯，繼暫停蘇沾區至西歐之鐡道交通後，將續採類似之行動。高級人士指出西方盟國現下自認在經濟方面足够向蘇聯還擊，以報復蘇聯之封鎖柏林。僉信克萊抵華府後，決定加倍空運，故其支援旣强，克萊可能定出新的經濟限制。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿七日電〕英美當局昨日下令禁止由西歐經過德境英美佔區至蘇佔區之鐡路交通。據英方發言人談稱，此舉主要影響所及　，爲蘇佔區興義大和·瑞士·及斯坎的那維亞半島國家等之貿易。該禁令之聲明並謂，「經過德國之國際鐡路運輸仍繼續通行」，此即西歐國家與鐡幕後諸國如捷克·波闌·與巴爾幹各國間之貿易，不受此項禁令影響。波羅的海與北海間重要水道基爾運河，現仍允許蘇聯通行。據悉，野於經由羅斯托克與斯丹丁兩港口之海岸綫交通之發展，現正加以極大注意。若干人士認爲此舉，乃西方國家企圖迫使蘇聯解除棓林封鎖，而或在全世界對蘇實施「經濟制裁」第一步手續之一種。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：巴黎訊：法總理馬利今日力促國會從遠對其新內閣投信任票，以避免來自左極右極可雙方之攻擊。馬利之新內閣閣員，皆係親英美份子，並無極左之共黨或極右之戴高樂派在內。又悉：法國會已以三五七票對一九七票之多數，否決法共辯論內閣閣員之提議，通過對馬利內閣之信任票。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕一昨夜深夜馬利將其閣員名單提呈總統，廿八名閣員中，激進社會黨佔五席，社會黨六席，人民共和黨六席，獨立共和黨兩席。此一項閣員名單將提交國民議會通過。由於馬利已得各有關政黨之同意，故其通過諒無問題。馬利提出最後名單前，須加以克服之困難，乃係與社會黨關於數點尚有意見之不同是也。據消息靈通方面稱，社會黨不贊同人民共黨黨員考斯特佛羅雷（昨誤書佛羅富）提名為海外領土部長，在此以一前各方均認爲小黨民主社會聯合黨之普勒芬係担任此職之最有可能性者。第二點係關於核心內閣人選之意見分較，馬利原來計劃本擬包括急進社會黨兩名，社會黨兩名，人民共和然兩名，獨立共和黨一名，惟社會黨須爭取更多之代表人數。馬里最後同意包括社會黨之內政部長莫計，及激進社會黨之國防部長雷尼梅友在內，在經過此項讓步後，社會黨即同意考斯特佛羅雷為海外領土部長。最可注意者即前外長皮杜爾未能在新內閣中佔一席是也。事前外界一致揣測渠必能在國務部長中佔一席，然竟出乎人意料之外未曾列入。</p>

<p>各種指數上漲比較首由吳市長闡明召開會議之意義後，繼由趙局長報告自本年一月一日起至七月二十四日止，各種指數上漲之倍數如下：（一）美匯四五·九倍，（二）材料油三七·二倍，（三）重柴油三四·五倍，（四）中柴油三八·四倍，（五）輕柴油三八·八倍，（六）汽油五十倍，（七）煤一四·六倍，（八）生活指數一四·五倍。公用事業上漲之倍數如下：（一）電燈十度以下者漲八·五倍，十一度至三十度者漲十一·四倍，三十度以者漲一四·二倍，（二）電力漲一三·一倍，（三）水漲一二·七倍。根據上列統計，證明公用事業價格，實不及物價之上漲，而各公司因週轉金缺乏，業務幾已無法維持。昨日會議時，上海電力，電話，法商電車電燈，上海自來水，英商電車，內堆自來水等各公司代表，分別陳述各公司困難情形後，即先行退席，俾便市政當局討論解救辦法。</p>
<p>得請中央銀行貸款</p>
<p>會議迄六時半始散，會後公用局長趙曾珏報告會中議決三項補救辦法如下：（一）燃料油及汽油，八月份起美援油即可運用，其價格當以一月調整一次爲標準，在未到之前，曾與兪總裁商定，對公用事業用油，予以一次結匯，並請中央對公用事業用油豁免關稅及進口附加稅。（二）煤價決定以每月調整一次爲原則，上海方面用煤，每月以供給四萬五千九百噸爲限，其所需之礦價運費，以每月發表後三日內一次付淸，至於煤款，如公司無力負担時，可由中央銀行借墊，付款辦法規定開澯煤付給中央信託局代收，華東煤付給徐州央行分行代收，淮南煤付給蚌埠央行分行代收，台灣煤付給台灣銀行滬分行代收。供應煤由各地分別負担，計開澯二萬噸，華東五千九百噸，淮南一萬噸，台灣一萬噸。（三）各項特捐如自衛特捐，由市府電華北當局予以固定，尚有保險費，上下力等約佔百分之十，尚未能固定。煤款約共需三萬億，請央行貸款，央行已表示盡量設法。今後各公司週轉金不數時，亦可請求央行貸款，至少於三個月後還淸。</p>
<p>每月一日公佈新價</p>
<p>關於公用事業八月份調整售價問題，討論最久，過去調整本月份價格時，係按照自動方式，該方式中各項成本價格爲上月份發表者，故公司　蝕較鉅，現議決將各項成本價格提平決定，油價及煤價於每月底先行決定後，維持一月中不變，至於生活指數及五金指數，決按照本月份所淤表者先行增加百分之五十，如是，則各項公用事業可於每月一日同時公佈新價，電力自來水等大用戶，決每半月收費一次。至於各公司要求每半月調整價格一次，爲避免刺激物價起見，未予通過。</p>
<p>公用事業調整價格新辦法，尚須待中央核定後施行之。公用局長趙曾珏定今晚晋京，携帶書而之公用事業貸款數字請求行政院批准後，由央行貸給。</p>

<h3 id="c98">羅山縣訓工作 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 時代社記者　翟念箕</p>
<p>開了信陽，當卡車進入羅山縣境以後，首先映入眼簾的，是那公路兩旁荒蕪了的田地，和在晨議中隨風搖幌的蔓草偶爾有到。一角殘垣斷壁，格外使人感到兵　後的凄凉。</p>
<p>抗戰時期，羅山縣是敵我膠着相持的地帶，在慘烈的拉鋸戰中，無數田園村莊變成了瓦礫堆，三十多萬人口的羅山縣，僅剩下十八九萬人了，勝利以後，這裏又經渦豫鄂邊區共匪幾度進擾，和抗拒了劉匪伯誠一度的圍攻，地方破壞的情形，更爲嚴重，不過當地的農民在政府和聯總的救濟扶持下，堅忍地在廢墟重總家國。車越走近縣城，墾荒和重建工作，也做得越有成績，這說明了在共匪大規模的破壞暴行下，人民只有依賴政府的眾事掩護和政洽支持，才能完成農村的重建。最近，羅山縣的人口已增至二十一二萬了。</p>
<p>羅山縣是豫東南的產米區，羅山米不但供應了大軍雲集的信陽，而且還有一部份運到漢口去，城關的商業以米行爲最大，數量也最多，信羅公路上的商車大都是載客到羅山再載米返信陽，汽車當天可往返一次，所以米商不致因信陽市塲的價格漲落而虧累，商車老闆則在米的運費中已嫌足了利潤，搭客不過是「外款」而已，「米運」維繫了信羅間的交通，促成了羅山城關的繁榮。</p>
<p>一支勇敢的隊伍</p>
<p>羅山縣長張玉龍是過去該縣常備自衛總隊的副總隊長，接充縣長還不到半年，在鄂豫邊區土共羅匪厚福不斷的騷擾攻擊中，他把自衛隊鐵鍊成一支勇敢善戰的鐡軍，在匪區的　緣地帶，只有用軍事來掩護政治，用政治來開拓經濟，然後才能够用軍事政治經濟的總體力量來肅淸匪患，因此，培植地方武力，實爲綏靖工作最基本的一環。</p>
<p>記者在縣府和張縣長暢談了三小時，他告訴記者許多關於編訓地方團隊的寶貴經驗，他指出當前影響地方團隊戰鬥力的兩個基本原因，一是部隊長吃空額，或者是把空額用來補助公費，二是祖任縣府及地方雜務，如催兵催款徵糧收稅等。且有撥部隊士兵充縣府高級職員及地方士紳之勤務雜兵者，所以他向地方民意機關提出了足兵足食的口號，「足兵」就是不吃空缺不祖負雜務，一心一意的練兵打仗。「足食」則必須按常備自衛隊實有人數，核實撥發糧餉。如何做到不吃缺和防止吃缺呢？其辦法是團隊幹部士兵均應在名册上黏貼本人像片，發糧兩時由地方參議會及公正紳士按册點各，團隊保證不缺兵，地方保證不缺食，足兵足食是整訓地方團隊的一個最低的基本條件。</p>
<p>帳縣長又指川和共匪作戰，必須深切明瞭匪的游擊戰術，只有瞭解敵人才能打聲敵人，况且遊擊戰是以劣勢裝備對付優勢裝備的戰術，地方團隊的裝備未必比共匪的裝備好，所以還應當以匪的游擊戰術來打擊共匪。如機動出擊，對小股殘匪以優勢兵力予以殲滅性之打擊，而俘獲其全部武器士兵，以補充自己。又如利用長距離的夜行軍，深入匪區百餘里吃掉其鄕公所的地方武力及小部隊等，以及利用兩翼迂迴等共匪慣用的戰術，所以在訓練的時候，即以共匪的游擊戰術爲訓練的主要內容。在作戰時，即以其道還諸其身，這樣會使羅匪厚福迭次在羅山邊境吃過大虧。</p>
<p>縣訓工作的特色</p>
<p>常備自衛隊是治安的一支棟樑，而民衆自衛隊則是堆砌起來的磚瓦，民衆自衛隊是全縣人力的總匯，是常備自衛朦的耳目和最有力的幫手，游擊戰術的運用決定於民衆組訓的嚴密與否，所以組訓手持刀棍槍矛，衹任通訊情報盤查放哨的民衆自衛隊，才是肅清境內潛匪和配合常備除作戰的偉大力量，因此，羅山的民衆自衛隊的組訓和常備隊的組訓同時並重，相輔進行。</p>
<p>張縣長爲了鞏固全縣的治安，他把五期縣政訓練班合作一期辦完，縣訓所一百多個學員的訓練，不在講堂上進行，而是劃定一個鄉，然後一甲一保地按照應訓練的科目一次一次實地去做，即從實踐中去訓練學員，這不啻是一個大的工作團，一方面在訓練工作中可以發生示範作用，另方面也澈底完成了淸查戶口，編組保甲，清查土地，肅清奸究等工作，這是羅山縣訓工作的一個特色。</p>
<p>嚴重的土地問題</p>
<p>羅山田地荒蕪的嚴　情形，是記者踏入羅山境內時的第一個印象，據張縣長告訴記者，勝利以後，「聯總」曾在公路兩旁進行開墾荒地工作，聯德結束後，第五綏靖區司令部即協同羅山縣府組織　荒大隊，並辦理移民，但因人力財力的不足，仍不能解決荒地問題，在這一個地廣人稀的情形下，土地分配自應不成問題。但經記者下鄉訪問的結果，罷山縣地主仍以五五對分的課租向佃戶收繳地租，因爲地主不但握有土地的所有權，而且還握有耕種所必需的農具和動力，因爲佔有土地和生產工具，可以不勞而獲坐享其成，所以綏靖區土地問題　　要內容，一爲如何開墾荒地，二爲如何進行减租减息，以改善個農生活，三爲土地應如何重新合理分配，取消租佃制度，開荒增　或限於人力財力必須逐步去做，土地改革必須在政府公佈法令之後，然後才能實施，但减租减息，只要各地政府有決心，立刻就可實現，問題在如何克服地方上土權的阻撓，和當地縣長對减租的認識和信心。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫教廿七日電〕世運　前後爲期兩週一切比賽必如火如茶，以塲面之偉大而言，廿九日之開幕禮，非任何比賽可與比擬。是日下午，看台上八萬觀衆，咸將恭候英王喬治六世之光降。國際世運委員會主席將伴英王入座，全體高唱英國國歌。其後各國選手團以國旗及國籍盾織爲前導，繞塲遊行，行經英王前成肅恭行禮。按世運傳統，希臘居萬國之首，其餘各國依字母排列，而英國則以地主關係，殿後壓陣。各國健兒　塲一周後，即列成多行，面對榮譽司令合。其時組織委員會主席謁見英王請英王致詞，英王將發表如下列之演說，宣布世運開幕：「朕今茲宣告於衆，一九四八年世界運動競技業已開始，斯爲現代之第十四屆世界運動會。」</p>
<p>稍息，號角高鳴禮砲一響聲中，火炬接力賽，最後一人自東門入塲，邁步横越跑道，以手中火炬，燃世運明燈。此燈日夜不熄，待世運結東後始已。其時世運旗冉冉上昇，數千倍鴿亦振翅高飛。按古希臘每逢奧令配克開始，輙以鴿羣升空，向各城市通告，此習沿用至今。於是英國隊長手擎英國旗率先趨榮譽司令台前。其他各國掌旗者，亦悉赴台前，在英國隊長四周宣誓，誓詞如下：「吾等謹以至誠，立此誓言，吾等以光榮競爭心理，參加世界運動會，矢志服從會章，　從運動精神，爲國家爭光，爲運動努力，此　」。官誓手續後，全體合唱世運會歌：「榮耀悉歸吾主基督」，會歌係吉柏齡之詞，季爾德作曲。</p>

<h3 id="c145">裝牙經騐談 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>人行年五十，剩齒十七，零落動搖，不堪供用·受易昭雪牙醫師之勤告，全部拔去，改裝全口義齒。幸賴易醫師技術高敏，拔時痛苦全無。所裝義齒，亦形式美觀，應用自然，可嚼炒　豆，無論花生米。惟初裝後一個月內，却有幾分不舒，過後方知，此「不舒」全由「不慣」而來。耐心裝用一個月，定能因「習慣」而十分舒適。深恐無此經驗之人，初裝時嘆苦說難，後悔莫及，或埋怨牙醫師裝得不好，因此自述經驗，敬告同病者。蓋鄙人自己初裝義齒之時，亦曾嘆苦，後悔，懷疑易昭雪牙醫師之技術；一個月後，方知全是寃杜，反覺抱歉而感激不盡也。「習慣」能使義齒舒適之理由，陳述如下：</p>
<p>義齒是以牙肉爲根据，把石硬的似齒裝在牙肉上的。在常人，牙肉的職任是護持牙齒，使牙齒像樹幹一樣堅牢地生在口中。故牙肉在牙根部最堅强，在外表部很軟弱，用牙　剔牙，用力太大了有時牙肉的外表部會購血。這足證牙肉的外表部是很軟弱的。只要牙根部的牙肉用力將牙齒把持，牙齒就能出力咬　堅硬的東西。</p>
<p>現在你把所有的牙齒拔光了，牙根部的牙肉，不要再盡護持之職。讓外表部的牙肉收縮下來，把拔牙的洞塡滿，然後來抵當石硬的義齒的托板。這樣，便是牙肉的堅强部辭了職，而軟弱部起來負重任了。好比一向閒散的人一旦當了繁重的差使，一定很感苦痛！所以義齒第一天裝上，你嚼緊來上下兩排牙肉受托板的壓迫，非常之痛。怕痛，只好不嚼緊來，不嚼緊，飯粒也咬不碎，何况硬物。這時候，就要後悔拔光，埋怨牙醫師無能。不耐煩起來，把新裝的義齒除下，寗願用牙肉啃飯吃。但這是茍且偸安，不是好辦法。因爲長此下去，沒有裝用義齒的一天，那時你眞要後悔了。我告訴你，初裝的二三天，是緊要關頭。這二三天內需要最大的忍耐。這二三天內只好吃些軟的東西。吃素的話，豆腐，豆腐衣，乳腐，芝麻醬，花生醬等，都吃得動。吃的話，鷄蛋，魚片，紅燒肉等都吃得動，營養都不差。暫時不吃筍，香菌，利鷄鴨排骨之類。有甚麼關係呢？</p>
<p>忍　了三天，第四天一定能　稍硬之物。我的經驗，是吃核桃。核桃比飯硬，比花生米軟，我認爲是最適當的試鍊物。要嚼得慢。摘取黄豆大的一小粒核桃用乎指好好地放在臼齒中間，教臼齒咬住，然後　緊來。一·二·三·四，嚼的速度同柔軟體操的動作一樣快慢。嚼到後來核桃自會嚼爛，香噴噴，汕嚕嚕的滋味，自會感到。這是你最初受義齒的孝敬，苦盡甘來的初步。核桃之外，還有燥的餅干和　，（例如狀元　，香　）也都是很好的試鍊物。嚼起來「沙沙」地響，還可助長義齒的威風。由核桃·餅干·　等物引導，慢慢的吃史硬的東四。一兩個月之後，你可吃花生米和炒　豆了</p>
<p>我裝牙至今半年有餘，已經完全習慣，應用自然，不辨其爲眞似了。在這裏我悟得了一點道理：人體的器官多少，原是沒有一定的。假如從古以來上帝只給人生一隻手和一隻脚，人也會習慣而滿足，不會要求兩隻手和兩雙脚。似如從古以來上帝沒有給人生　頭，人從來沒有聞到過香臭，也會習慣而滿足，不會要求有　頭。再從積極方面說，假如從占以來上帝給人在頭上多生一個器官叫做X，這X能聽見遠處的聲音，同現在的無綫電收音機一樣，人用慣了這器官，認爲當然應該有的，缺少了便認爲疾病。假如從古以來上帝給人背上生一對翅膀，能隨時起飛，同現在的飛機一樣，人用慣了這器官，也認爲當然應該有的，缺少了便認爲殘廢。可知人體的器官，可多可少，原無一定的。所以世間少一目的人，習慣之後，視覺同我們一樣靈敏。少一腿的人，習慣之後，走路同我們一樣快。我曾見過每手只兩根指頭的人，因爲習惯了，一樣可以取物，寫字，甚至彈琴。我會見過兩手都沒有的人，因爲習慣了，居然能用脚趾數鈔票，推牌九。可知人體的器官，多少原無一定，習惯之後就自然。假定從古以來上帝沒有給人造牙齒，牙齒必須用大工裝置，那麼，我正是一個普通健全的人，因爲我同你們一樣能嚼東西吃的呀！</p>
<p>我常作如是想，所以我對於我的義齒十分滿意。就把這經驗談和感想寫出來，掛在易昭霉牙醫師的診所裏，並普告世之同病者。（卅七年七月於杭州。）</p>
<h3 id="c146">大魚吃小魚 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>在春季，缸裏的魚兒都散子了，看它們從破卵到出生，不消幾時，由一條孑孓般大小樣子逐漸逐漸地長成起來。可是，小魚的發育有快慢，你要是任它去自生自滅，魚食—水蛆—給得不足，它們就會弱肉強食，大一些的就揀比自身小一些的吞噬起來，魚類是沒有靈感的，不管是同類，向族，甚至是同牢共食，祗想爲一已充腸鼓腹，茍延一時，也就什麼不顧了。</p>
<p>缸裏的金魚，有時可由人來撈取，來選擇大小，分離開來，把它們大對大，小歸小，就可以相安一時。</p>
<p>缸中的小魚是如此，河海裏的魚蝦之類，亦復如是。好在水族中滋長繁盛，雖是這樣的自相殘殺，還是生生不息。弱肉强食，固是天演的公理，請看國際間，社會間，凡是人與人相處的塲合，那一處不顯露着弱肉强食與同類相殘呢？</p>
<h3 id="c147">揩油 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>揩油其實即是舞弊。如果國際飯店屋頂那四個大字尚在人間的話，楷油之於個人於社會，都屬莫大的汚點；然而按諸近來都市的民情，似乎揩汕已被大家認爲「人情之常」了。略通世故的人，大槪決不會因爲商店逃避印花或賣票員不給票十而提異議；何况：「這又不是揩你的油！干卿底事？」再說：「生活如此高！」上海方言對於這種精通人情　故的人，稱爲「落檻」或「識相」</p>
<p>於是乎，勝利後的上海楷油風行，由下而上，權威的機關自民國三十四年八月起一致（或先後）拒付水·電·煤氣·電話各項費用；而唯其不付費而可照常享用，所以用起來便毫不留情，極爲關綽；因此今天把這筆賬一算，赫然已在「一」字下面，拖了十幾個圈兒。（此數並未按過去幣値照指數計算。）</p>
<p>公司當局有其法寶二犧牲弱者，息事寗人。你們楷油吧，我漲價；我在市民用戶的收賬單上加了一行紅字：「某月某日前如不繳付，即行停止供應，不另通知。」於是問題解決了，從勝利以迄今日。</p>
<p>公司對揩油的見解，也和一般市民對賣票員楷油的看法，略相類似：「你揩油吧！反正又揩不到我的身上。慷他人之慨，何樂不爲？」</p>
<h3 id="c148">「姐姐」與「姊姊」 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>學生文卷中稱其女兄往往多寫作「姐姐」。有人問我「姐」「姊」二字是否相通。我說字只要用慣，不必問其相通不相通。舉例言，皮球之「球」本從「毛」旁，從「玉」旁則作「玉」解；然現在不聞有說作「毬」者，這是一明證。况「姐」見淸翟灝通俗編云：「近世稱女兄爲姐」，是猶爹之與爸，何必深究！至「姊」則見於說文，因許書是字書正宗，故人恒守之，至今猶然。</p>
<p>「姐」之上有冠以「小」字，稱爲「小姐」者，現在尤覺時髦，像空中小姐等，亦不勝舉。考錢惟演玉堂逢辰錄載有掌茶酒宮人韓小姐，「小姐」二字始見於此，然是人名，非稱謂也。來句云云，頗覺不解，因韓表其姓，小姐則明明是稱謂而非人名可知。錢宋人，故一小姐」二字，宋時已有此稱謂。再說得「古」一些，繁欽與曹丕箋有史妠　姐句，注謂當時樂人。開天遺事：寗王有樂妓　姐。陶毅淸異錄有平康妓醟姐，東坡集付妓人楊姐，俱見通俗編。准此，「姐」的稱謂，魏唐之間已通行。「姐」上冠「小」亦無非表嬌小之意。故明人朱有燉詩有「簾前三寸弓鞋露，知是媆媆小姐來一之句。一媆媆」是名，「小姐」是稱謂。通俗編以爲「姐是甚賤之稱，俗惟貴家女方得呼之，何相戾也」，此尤見解太舊，因稱少女曰「姐」，曰「小姐」，亦猶稱「妹」或「小妹」一般，非貴家女所得獨專。不知閱者以為然否。</p>
<p>「姊姊」二字入詩，見唐司空表聖詩：「姊姊教人且抱兒」。</p>

<p>金鷄納霜治瘧最靈，可惜其味太苦，偶然嚼碎糖衣，簡直苦得不亦樂乎。蘇聯的科學家們有鑒於斯，已經在把金鷄納霜（植物）給蜜蜂吃，患　者祇要吃這種蜜蜂所　的蜜，一樣可以治病，而毫無苦味。</p>
<p>一部近年來出品的汽車，平均籌命爲十二年，可以開駛十萬哩。</p>
<p>美國雖鬧房荒，搬塲之風不衰。自一九四〇年迄今的八年來，人民之從這一州搬到另外一州者，達一千二百萬人；留居本州內而遷移到另一郡者，達一千三百萬人。在同一郡內搬來搬去者，達四千四百萬人。換言之，短短不到十年的時候，差不多倒有全美國半數的人口搬塲。</p>
<p>卽將在倫敦開幕的世界運動會中，在徑賽終點處設有一種特製的照相機，能在各運動員衝過白綫的一霎那間，仔細拍攝各人到達的先後，決無糢糊之弊。在攝影後九十秒之內就能印好照片，以供栽判時參考。</p>

<p>論語子貢曰，「紂之不善，不如是之甚也，是以君子惡居下流，天下之惡皆歸焉。」子貢智者，孔子許爲可與言詩，玩味此言，復知可與論史矣。下流二字何指，不易細說，意凡可以歸惡者皆是也，此與君子四惡之「居下流」異義。紂爲不善，而非甚惡，微子貢其誰與伸寃乎。史筆未是至公，人言恒多溢惡，且世尚有非爲不善，徒負其名者，人以其名惡，則以天下之惡歸之矣，是以君子知此，常有所不爲。伊尹治亦進，亂亦進，五就湯，五就桀，其勢至危，亦幸古人知恕，反稱以能任，否則黨惡罪一，反覆罪二，嚴予淸算，功不補過，尚得蒙聖人之號乎。此孔子所以不爲衛君，終不附公山不擾與佛胓，而有避世，避地，避色，避言之論。子貢不受命而貨殖，誠有見於政治之不可强爲。貧而樂者惟一顏回，冉求爲季氏聚歛，賦粟倍他日，雖非自肥，不免於嗚鼓之攻，亦居下流之一例也。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Control Yuan held its 26th meeting at 9:30 AM on the 27th, chaired by President Yu. They continued to discuss the "Draft Measures for the Election of Supervisory Committee Members for Administrative Offices." The speeches of the committee members still expressed dissatisfaction with the Organic Statute of Administrative Offices passed by the Legislative Yuan. However, out of a spirit of abiding by the law, in addition to requesting reconsideration, they had no choice but to proceed with the establishment in accordance with the law. After repeated discussions today, and after several people put forward amendments and temporary motions for a vote, the proposal by Qing Shen'an was finally passed by a majority: "Supervisory Committee Administrative Offices and Inspection Teams should be established simultaneously. The organization of the inspection teams: 1. Taiwan, 2. Mongolia, 3. Overseas, 4. Provinces and regions where administrative offices are not located but are deemed necessary." The reason this proposal was passed was that it could supplement the shortcomings of the Organic Statute of Administrative Offices, and at the same time, it could immediately organize and begin work. The passage of this proposal has resolved the administrative office issue, which had been debated for two days without a decision.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Control Yuan continued to hold its 26th general meeting in the afternoon of the 27th, chaired by President Yu. They discussed the measures for the election of Supervisory Committee members for administrative offices. After item-by-item discussion, the first article was amended, dividing it into two items: election methods and the number of committee members. The opinions of the committee members were summarized and put to a vote. As a result, it was passed by a majority that each province and city Supervisory Committee would nominate three to seven candidates. The second article, concerning the distribution of native and non-native committee members, caused heated debate. Committee members such as Liu Pingjiang spoke in favor of maintaining the original draft, while Liang Shangdong proposed that the number of native committee members be limited to one. The chairman put it to a vote. Of the 88 people present, 52 voted in favor of maintaining the original text, which stated that no fewer than one elected member should be a non-native Supervisory Committee member. The remaining third, fourth, and fifth articles were passed without objection. The chairman then asked for the opinion of the assembly on Article 3 of the "Organic Statute of the Supervisory Committee Administrative Offices of the Control Yuan," which stated, "The Supervisory Committee Administrative Offices in each Supervisory District may be decided by a meeting of the Control Yuan not to be established or to be merged for establishment." It was resolved to temporarily establish (1) Ningqing District, (2) Yulu District, (3) Jinshan Sui District, (4) Yungui District, (5) Liangguang District, (6) Lianghu District, (7) Wangang District, (8) Mintai District, (9) Suzhe District, (10) Jirecha District, (11) Chuankang District, and (12) Liaoning Andong Liaobei District, and to have each district nominate one convener (list attached) to convene meetings and elect candidate committee members. The list should be submitted to the Secretariat before noon on the 28th for the purpose of printing ballots. Finally, they discussed the temporary motion by Lu Fengge and 23 others, "Please request the Executive Yuan to quickly send cadres to preside over the government of Rehe Province, save the current critical situation, protect this important national defense location, and comfort public opinion." After the original proposer, Lu Fengge, explained the reasons, Wang Guanwu and Zhang Dinghua successively spoke, and it was passed without objection to be sent to the Executive Yuan for correction. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. The list of conveners for the twelve districts is now recorded below: Gan Ningqing District: Quan Shaowen, Jilu District: Zhao Jixun, Pushan Sui District: Zhu Mengbiao, Yungui District: Gu Yingqiu, Liangguang District: Li Xuhuan, Lianghu District: Chen Darong, Wangang District: Cao Haosen, Mintai District: Chen Dayuan, Suzhe District: Liu Pingjiang, Jirecha District: Wang Xuan, Chuankang District: Lü Chao, Liaoning Andong Liaobei District: Qi Dapeng.</p>

The agricultural construction project is being drafted by Yan Yangchu, but it has not yet been submitted.

<h3 id="e24">The Formation of the Marie Cabinet in France <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Just as the Cold War in Berlin was raging, the Schuman cabinet in France suddenly collapsed, forcing Foreign Minister Bidault, who was attending the Western European Five-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference far away overseas, to return home ahead of schedule. From whatever perspective one observes it, the cabinet crisis in France always deepens the instability of the European situation. However, after a week of political turmoil in France, the formation of a cabinet by Radical Socialist leader Marie has finally stabilized the situation. Whether for France itself or for the entire Europe, the formation of Marie's new cabinet is a welcome development.</p>
<p>The reason for the collapse of the Schuman cabinet this time, on the surface, was due to the defense budget issue. The defense expenditure proposed by Prime Minister Schuman and the Popular Republican Movement he led was 117 million US dollars, but the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party advocated reducing it by 17 million US dollars. The National Assembly actually passed this bill to cut the defense budget on the evening of the 19th. In order to avoid holding a general election, the Schuman cabinet announced its resignation without waiting for the parliament to pass a vote of no confidence. However, looking into the behind-the-scenes aspects of French politics, the collapse of the Schuman cabinet was due more to the failure of the Schuman cabinet's diplomacy than to the reduction of the defense budget. Since the conclusion of the West German Agreement at the London Six-Nation Conference, the French government and public have become suspicious and fearful of the Anglo-American "pro-German policy," and the reputation of Foreign Minister Bidault, who signed on behalf of France, has been ruined ever since. Although the Schuman cabinet survived the crisis thanks to the reluctant approval of the National Assembly, its position in the eyes of the French people began to waver from then on. This collapse can be said to be an inevitable result of the evolution of the French political situation.</p>
<p>Cabinet changes are commonplace in democratic countries, especially in France, where cabinet changes are frequent, and it is not uncommon to replace several cabinets in one month. But why should we pay special attention to this cabinet change now? The reason is very simple. According to the current French constitution, if two governments are overthrown by the parliament through a vote of no confidence in succession, a national general election must be held. The leftist Communist Party and the right-wing Gaullist faction have long been eager to use the general election to seize power. The French Communist Party has long had the ambition to seize power, not to mention it for the moment. As for the Gaullist faction, de Gaulle openly said in a speech in Paris on July 19: "The National Congress of the People's Rally should formulate a policy program that can be implemented immediately, because there will be a need for this soon, and France must be led by the People's Rally." At the same time, he also put forward four propositions: (1) solve social problems with "associations"; (2) solve colonial problems with the French Federation; (3) deal with the Soviet threat to Europe with the European Federation; (4) rescue the domestic crisis by reorganizing the government.</p>
<p>However, in terms of France's current position in Europe and its actual needs, neither the leftist Communist Party nor the right-wing Gaullist faction is what France needs. In other words, the ruling of the left and right wings is harmful and unprofitable to the country and the nation. Therefore, after the collapse of the Schuman cabinet of the Popular Republican Movement, the French government and the public all hoped that France could maintain a government that takes the middle road. When President Auriol and Socialist veteran Blum discussed the candidates for prime minister, they favored Radical Socialist leader and former Minister of Justice Marie. Their reason was: "If a person from the Radical Socialist Party is appointed as prime minister, it can dispel the fear of the rise of the de Gaulle movement among the general public." Everyone knows that the French Radical Socialist Party is misnamed. Although it is nominally called the Radical Socialist Party, its actual progress is not as rapid as that of the Socialist Party. The National Assembly also believed that organizing a center-right cabinet was better than holding a general election that would give de Gaulle the opportunity to seize power. Therefore, it agreed to Marie as prime minister with a majority of 352 to 190 votes, allowing him to form a new cabinet. At the same time, the Socialist Radical Socialist and Popular Republican Parties also believed that Marie's qualifications might not meet the expectations of the public at home and abroad, so they decided that the leaders of the three parties would all participate in the organization of a coalition cabinet to enhance the position of the Marie cabinet. The most eye-catching names on the new cabinet list are Socialist veteran Blum as Deputy Prime Minister, Independent Republican leader Reynaud as Minister of Finance, Popular Republican leader Teitgen as Deputy Prime Minister, Socialist leader Ramadier as Minister without Portfolio, and Schuman himself as Foreign Minister. Such a lineup is stronger than any coalition cabinet and seems to be more than capable of coping with domestic and foreign difficulties.</p>
<p>However, the problems facing France are numerous, among which the most difficult one is France's diplomatic problem. France's situation between the Western allies and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly difficult. The middle road has become impassable in fact, and where to go has caused the feeling of being torn between two options. Another problem is France's economic problem. Due to the destruction of the war, the country is full of scars. If economic recovery is to be mentioned, foreign aid must be obtained. However, relying on foreign aid economically, it has no choice but to follow others diplomatically, and even has to accept the West German Agreement that is only beneficial to Germany. This contradictory behavior can not only be used as material for the left wing to attack, but also as a reason for the right wing to oppose. When Marie first announced his policy guidelines to the National Assembly, he also focused on foreign policy and placed domestic issues in a secondary position. Marie said: "France's position in Europe should always pay attention to not engaging in excessive provocations, but also should maintain a firm stand at times. I will implement a firm but non-provocative foreign policy: (1) The German policy should be based on the resolutions of the London Six-Nation Conference. France is willing for Germany to regain its proper position in Europe, but it cannot sacrifice the interests of other European countries because of this. I believe that the opportunity of the next United Nations General Assembly to be held in Paris in September should be used to seek a thorough solution to the German problem. (2) Regarding Anglo-French relations, I believe that France must work hand in hand with the United Kingdom and unconditionally support the Anglo-French 50-year alliance treaty. (3) Regarding US aid, France should be grateful for the Marshall Plan's aid to Europe, but France must still prepare to help itself so that it can stand on its own after US aid stops.</p>
<p>From the report of the new Prime Minister Marie, the Marie cabinet is still a continuation of the Schuman cabinet, and there is no difference in essence. In today's Europe, where polarization is becoming increasingly clear, France's situation is becoming more and more difficult. How to deal with both sides? It is indeed a difficult task. We look forward to the future of the center-right Marie cabinet, but we still cannot be overly optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Head of the Ministry of Transportation Discusses: Our Country Upholds Inland Navigation Rights; US Ships Carrying US Aid Must First Obtain Special Permission <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Our country's shipping industry mostly opposes the government's special permission for American ships to carry goods into the two ports of the Yangtze River, Jing and Hu. According to a discussion with the head of the Ministry of Transportation, the government's special permission for American ships to carry aid to China into the two ports of the Yangtze River, Jing and Hu, is completely different from the opening of inland navigation rights. The Ministry of Transportation believes that the opposition opinion held by our shipping industry is not without merit. The government has always upheld inland navigation rights, and will continue to follow this policy in the future without changing it. As for foreign ships sailing to non-open ports, it is customary to first obtain special permission from the Executive Yuan before they can enter. The transportation of US aid materials this time can also be handled by the Executive Yuan at its discretion, according to this special permit to enter the inland port. Regarding the total tonnage of US aid materials, it is said to be about one million tons. Currently, our country has about 30 ships that meet international standards and can sail abroad, all of which can be entrusted with the transportation of US aid materials. As for the transfer of these materials from the coast to the inland, in addition to the need to strengthen the unloading equipment, it will not be very difficult for our country's ships to carry them.</p>

<p>Evans to Come to China to Instruct on Usage</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] The US Medical Aid to China Bureau announced that it has issued a special appropriation of US$20,000 to China for the purchase of gelatin, a plasma substitute. 10,000 units of a solid, transparent, tasteless, gelatinous protein extracted from the white binding tissue and cortex of animal bones. Introducing the application of gelatin to China to replace high-priced plasma is an important part of the bureau's 1948 plan. It is said that gelatin is cheaper and easier to apply than plasma, making it ideal for China. Although gelatin tends to transform into a colloidal substance at low temperatures, it is very effective in hospitals for fainting and blood loss. Dr. Evans, one of the most famous female surgeons in the United States and professor at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, will go to China after August to instruct Chinese surgeons on the use of gelatin. Dr. Evans is an authoritative scholar in this field. She will visit Japan in August on behalf of the US Atomic Bomb Injury and Disease Committee, and then transfer to China. The Medical Aid to China Bureau has already shipped the gelatin to China in preparation for the implementation of this medical program.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 27th] Wuhu's current water level is 11.075 meters, down 0.075 meters from yesterday. The scorching heat accelerates the grain filling of rice ears. A general harvest can be expected in 15 days. Wuhu rice prices have fallen back to 30 million yuan. Rice in Anqing and other places is only 15 million yuan. If the Yangtze River does not breach the embankment along the river within 20 days, a 70% bumper harvest can provide enough food for the year. Inflation can also be diluted by the entry of rice into the market.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Anqing, 27th] One week into the dog days, it is sometimes cloudy and sometimes sunny, with a cool air blowing. It is predicted that this year's autumn harvest will be late, and with natural disasters and floods, miscellaneous grains, rice, and firewood will be expensive.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Ministry of Food Cables the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters: Absolutely No Borrowing or Allocating Military Grain <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] The Pacification Headquarters received a telegram from the Ministry of Food on the 27th, stating that according to reports, your headquarters and the Chongqing Municipal Government consulted and decided that since the county-level public grain ordered by the Ministry in various counties near Chongqing has not been paid, the county governments should allocate 100,000 shi of this grain for the municipal government to sell for civilian consumption. An investigation found that the payment for the provincial and county-level grain purchased by the Ministry in Sichuan Province had already been allocated to the provincial government for distribution, and that the grain in various counties near Chongqing was conveniently concentrated, making it the most reliable source of grain for external transfer. Borrowing or allocating it would directly affect the external transfer of military grain and indirectly affect the supply of military grain at the front. Currently, hundreds of thousands of troops in the Northeast, Hebei, Henan, Qing, Ji, Xu, Hai, Jing, and Shanghai and other places require tens of thousands of large packages of regular military grain every month, all of which rely on the established grain sources in Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces for transport and relief. During the current flood season, it is necessary to step up the daily transport of the required military grain. Ships have already been negotiated in many ways. All of the above-mentioned purchased grain should be concentrated and transported immediately, and it must not be diverted. In addition to cabling the Sichuan Provincial Government to strictly order the county governments to concentrate and allocate transport in accordance with the original plan, please supervise and order them to immediately stop borrowing and allocating to maintain military food supplies.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] News from the Ministry of Food: Regarding the so-called Wuxi grain hoarding case in Shanghai, the Ministry dispatched Shen Guojin, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department, and Inspector Wang Mingyi, along with Zhuang Qianghua, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Grain Use Department, to conduct a thorough investigation. The report is as follows: (1) Regarding the amount of grain stored in Wuxi, the Shanghai telegram reported that there were 300,000 dan of stored grain. An investigation found that this was a statistical figure before the Wuxi County Government carried out the sale at stable prices on June 19. At the time of the investigation, the actual number of grains stored in various warehouses and stations was more than 527,000 dan of paddy rice, more than 5,000 dan of yuan rice, more than 11,000 dan of japonica and indica rice, and more than 97,000 bags of flour (including 78,000 bags of flour to be delivered to the Agricultural Bank of China and the China Trust Bureau that were purchased and transported north). In addition, grain stores and rice mills store about 200,000 dan of grain, and flour mills store about 100,000 dan of wheat raw materials. Compared with the storage amount at the same time in previous years, the above-mentioned amount of 520,000 dan of grain stored in warehouses and stations is already very different, and Wuxi is the main rice market on the Jing-Hu line, supplying Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and dozens of cities and counties north and south of the Yangtze River. This amount is not too much, but when grain prices fluctuate, the grain administration authorities in the county should order various households to provide for market needs to fulfill the supply capacity of the distribution market. (2) It is true that the grain stored in Wuxi warehouses and stations has the names of grain tributes, accumulated grain, and public grain agency households from Wuxi, Kunshan, Nanhui, Jiangyin, Changshu, and Tianchang counties, totaling more than 28,000 dan of japonica and indica rice, but each county's council has provided proof, and the Wuxi District Court Inspection Office has confirmed that it is true, so there should be no situation of hoarding under false names. (3) From June 2 to July 13, more than 7,000 packages of rice were transported from Jiaxing and Xiashi to Wuxi. An investigation found that they were transported from Wenjiazhen and Yingtan in Jiangxi via Jiaxing and Xiashi, and they were not Zhejiang rice. China Travel Service has submitted proof of transport and transfer in Jiaxing and Xiashi. (4) Regarding the Shanghai hoarding households' fleeing transportation of stored grain to Wuxi, an investigation found that only 9 carts of military grain and salt were transported from Shanghai to Wuxi on June 20, and only a small amount of single-hulled wooden boats were transported by waterway, which was a very small number, and there was no large-scale Shanghai grain escaping to Wuxi.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Our country's trade with Japan has gradually started to open up. In the past, the regulations on the number of private business representatives to Japan and the length of stay were too narrow to meet the needs of the national industry and commerce community. Tang Jusheng, the commercial specialist of our country's representative group in Japan, recently reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting relaxation. The ministry lightly submitted it to the 14th meeting of the Trade Guidance Committee with Japan for discussion. It was generally believed that our country's trade with Japan was a barter trade. Under the strict control of the Allied Headquarters, the procedures were very complicated. The original one-month deadline could not be completed, and the number of people and the deadline should be relaxed. It was resolved by the whole body that private business representatives to Japan should be dispatched once every three months, with 60 to 100 people in each batch. The length of stay in Japan should be appropriately extended depending on the actual needs to facilitate the promotion of trade. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has prepared a document for submission to the Executive Yuan for verification. According to the report of Tang Jusheng, commercial specialist of the resident representative group in Japan: As of mid-July, more than 30 contracts have been signed for our country's trade with Japan, with a total trade value of approximately US$500,000. Private businessmen in Japan continue to engage in trade. The domestic industry and commerce community attaches great importance to the development of Sino-Japanese trade and has requested to participate, so it should be relaxed. Moreover, the Allied Headquarters' new regulations have long abolished the restrictions on the number of people from each country. Any merchant from any country who intends to go to Japan for trade can go after being approved by his home government. Our country should take this opportunity to strengthen the trade function to win the international market.</p>

<h3 id="e55">President Truman's Message to Congress, Presents Eleven-Point Plan, Focusing on Stabilizing the Economy and Solving the Housing Shortage <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 27th Broadcast: President Truman today presented a message to the special session of the US Congress with seven major points, requesting that it be passed into law. In addition to wage and price controls, the US President particularly emphasized the point of domestic anti-inflation, stating: "This work is urgent, as inflation has a great connection with the US foreign policy. The Communist Party deeply hopes that the prosperity of the United States will turn into a recession. They do not believe that we can stop the rise in prices, and think that the economic collapse of our country is inevitable. If a recession really occurs in our country, the hope for world peace will surely disappear with it."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The Republican-controlled 80th Congress reconvened yesterday. President Truman today presented an eleven-point plan that he hopes to implement, which is politically explosive. Among them, "anti-inflation" and "housing problem" are at the forefront, and other points include: (1) Federal subsidies for education; (2) Increasing the national minimum wage; (3) Expanding social security; (4) Revising the ranks and salaries of federal civil servants; (5) Bill of Rights; (6) Amendment to immigration law; (7) $65 million US loan for the permanent headquarters of the United Nations; (8) Approval of the International Wheat Agreement; (9) Restoration of the $58 million fund for the power reclamation plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The most politically contentious parliament in American history has begun in a fierce atmosphere. The Republican Party is determined to oppose the President's expansion of his economic control powers. They hope that Truman will re-introduce the Bill of Rights, as this caused a revolt among Southern Democrats in mid-February of this year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] President Truman today presented a message to Congress, putting forward an eleven-point plan. Truman asked for a special meeting of the Congress, which he criticized as "one of the worst in history," to enact price and salary control measures, rationing, and excess profits tax. He also warned that the fight against inflation cannot be stopped before the election. Truman also called for the passage of a comprehensive solution to the national housing shortage. Although Truman listed eleven points, he urged members to pay particular attention to anti-inflation and housing shortage proposals. Due to Republican opposition to a special summer session, Truman said, "High prices will not pause to watch the election, and high prices will not wait for the opening of the next Congress. This situation is getting worse day by day."</p>
<p>The secondary plans put forward by Truman include the Bill of Rights, federal government aid to education, raising the minimum wage, and expanding social security policies. Regarding human rights, President Zhu did not go into details, only stating that he would reiterate the Bill of Rights against lynching and anti-voting tax proposed in February. Equal employment for both blacks and whites, and the abolition of the bad habits of separating seats for blacks and whites on vehicles traveling between states: "I believe that in order to protect the authenticity of the Constitution, we must achieve the points I have previously proposed. I believe that Americans believe in freedom and equality, and must seek it in this direction."</p>
<h3 id="e56">US Economic Stability and Prosperity are Tied to World Peace <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The important parts of Truman's message are as follows: "The urgent needs of the American people make us meet here today. Our people ask the government to put forward legislation to do two things: first, to curb inflation and the rise in the cost of living, and second, to solve the housing shortage. These things affect every American family. What's more, world peace depends on our country's economic strength, and these things also affect the whole world.</p>
<p>"Domestic and foreign communists are waiting for our country to fall from its current prosperity into a recession. They do not believe that we will stop high prices, and they also hope for the collapse of the American economy. If we cannot control prices and bring about another recession, the hope for world peace will be lost. The free countries of Europe have suffered a lot, and the economic collapse of the United States will delay the recovery of the world, and this is the key to peace. If this tragedy occurs, we are really to blame."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Prices Continue to Rise, People's Lives are Suffering <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>"At this time, our strength is being tested all over the world. If we cannot stop inflation, we will be terribly wrong. The cost of living now is unprecedented in history. Last year, a quarter of American families did not have enough income to cover their expenses. Families with low or medium incomes did not have enough money to buy many necessities at high prices. At the same time, industrial prices are also soaring. Industrial organizations with the ability to lead the national economy have recently announced large price increases. If we do not curb inflation, the result will be a sharp reduction in output and personnel, and the government will be powerless at that time. Therefore, I urge Congress to take strong and active action to control inflation."</p>
<h3 id="e58">Curb Inflation and Take Effective Measures <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>"The plan I propose is as follows: First, re-levy the excess profits tax for a certain month to combat inflation. Second, restore consumer capital control to suppress inflation capital. Third, authorize the Federal Reserve to control inflationary bank capital. Fourth, authorize the government to control speculation in commodity transactions. Fifth, authorize the government to allocate and investigate rare items. Sixth, strengthen rent control and establish appropriate laws to enforce it, in order to prevent unreasonable rent increases. Seventh, authorize the government to ration products that are in short supply and are related to the people's health and well-being when necessary. However, this point may not need to be implemented as it is now. Eighth, the prices of rare items related to major industrial production or the cost of living should be controlled."</p>
<p>"Let me say again, there are many temporary profits that can offset wage increases without raising prices. We should continue to adopt free and cooperative buying and selling methods to achieve non-inflationary wage increases. The government sets a price limit, and the government does not intend to manage wage adjustments within the price limit, but if the salary increase makes the price limit invalid, the government will have to restrict it."</p>
<h3 id="e59">Mutually Plan to Solve the Housing Shortage, Immigration Law Should Be Amended <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>"The second reason I called Congress is that the people hope that legislation will be made to deal with the national housing shortage. We urgently need low-priced houses so that people with middle incomes, especially veterans, can afford the rent. Senate Bill No. 866 is a very good housing bill, which was passed by the Senate on April 22. We need this bill, but now, not a year later." Truman then called on Congress to immediately pass education plans and other social policies, and said:</p>
<p>"Regarding the world, we should also take immediate action to show that we mean what we say and that we have confidence in freedom, humanity and international peace cooperation. This involves three methods: First, the current Displaced Persons Act is unfair in terms of religion and soil. The regulations of this act completely violate American ideals, and this act should be amended immediately. In addition, the current act only allows 200,000 people to enter the United States. I deeply feel that this act should stipulate that 400,000 people should enter the country within four years.</p>
<p>"Second, many people in the world say that we are desperately embracing the United Nations on the one hand, but we are not very generous with money to build its headquarters on the other. Therefore, we should immediately pass a law allowing the US government to loan money to build the United Nations headquarters in New York. The International Wheat Agreement is also a meeting and should be approved quickly."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: An diplomatic official said today that the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have decided to order the ambassadors of the three countries to the Soviet Union to personally propose suggestions to Molotov to resolve the Berlin crisis and other German issues.</p>
<p>It is said that this method is easier to reach an agreement than formal diplomatic notes. This can at least avoid another breakdown in formal diplomatic negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: The delegations of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have unanimously completed the agreement on a new response to the Soviet Union. At the same time, they have also unanimously agreed on a long-term strategy on how to deal with the Soviet Union's political offensive. Although this agreement still needs to be submitted to the governments of the three countries for individual approval.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] It is reported that after nearly 24 hours of continuous negotiations here among senior diplomatic representatives of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, a preliminary agreement has been reached today on the next suggestion to be presented orally to Molotov to resolve the Berlin issue. It is also learned that some US officials advocated presenting it directly to Stalin, but this was opposed by the United Kingdom and France. The United Kingdom and France warned that this action would lead to a showdown, which is not what Western European countries want. The British government has decided to cancel the plan for a full debate on the international situation on the 28th. Because the current situation is extremely tense, Foreign Secretary Bevin does not believe that he will answer questions about the Berlin crisis, especially during the negotiations here on the Soviet Union's notes. Sources familiar with the matter said that the full text of the new Soviet note can be prepared today, but warned that the Western Allies must prepare for a long-term exchange of letters with the Soviet Union before the Berlin or the entire German issue is resolved. They believe that although the result of this exchange of letters may be to convene a four-power conference, it will not be the case at present, because the United States has not yet agreed.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] Truman today issued an order to take drastic steps to abolish racial discrimination in federal government employment issues and in the military. The President, by executive order, advocated the establishment of a Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Military directly under the President, and issued another order stipulating fair employment in federal government agencies. Southern Democrats had initially taken a rebellious stance, threatening that if the Republican Party put forward any human rights bill in the special Congress, the Southern Party would block it. Truman's joint promulgation of the order was to preemptively amend the fair employment and non-discrimination clauses in the military within the human rights section of the platform, without waiting for his political enemies to propose a bill. Truman said that it is very important to maintain higher democratic standards in the military, and that the policy of equal treatment and equal opportunities should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 27th] It is generally believed that the Western Allies are preparing to intensify their squeeze on the Soviet Union in the short term. After suspending railway transportation from the Soviet-occupied zone to Western Europe, they will continue to take similar actions. Senior officials pointed out that the Western Allies now believe that they are economically sufficient to retaliate against the Soviet Union in retaliation for the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. It is believed that after Clay arrives in Washington, he will decide to double the airlift. Therefore, with strong support, Clay may set new economic restrictions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 27th] British and American authorities yesterday ordered a ban on railway transportation from Western Europe through the British and American occupied zones of Germany to the Soviet occupied zone. According to a British spokesman, the main impact of this move is on trade between the Soviet-occupied zone and Italy, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. The statement of the ban also said that "international railway transportation through Germany will continue to pass", that is, trade between Western European countries and countries behind the Iron Curtain such as the Czech Republic, Poland, and the Balkan countries is not affected by this ban. The Kiel Canal, an important waterway between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, is still allowed to be used by the Soviet Union. It is reported that great attention is now being paid to the development of coastal traffic through the ports of Rostock and Stettin. Some people believe that this move is an attempt by Western countries to force the Soviet Union to lift the blockade of Berlin, or one of the first steps in imposing "economic sanctions" on the Soviet Union around the world.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: Paris News: French Prime Minister Marie today urged Congress to vote for confidence in his new cabinet in order to avoid attacks from both the extreme left and the extreme right. The members of Marie's new cabinet are all pro-British and American, and there are no extreme left communists or extreme right de Gaulleists in it. It is also learned that the French Congress has rejected the proposal of the French Communist Party to debate the members of the cabinet by a majority of 357 votes to 197, and passed a vote of confidence in the Marie cabinet.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Marie presented his list of cabinet members to the President late last night. Among the 28 cabinet members, the Radical Socialist Party occupies five seats, the Socialist Party six seats, the Popular Republican Party six seats, and the Independent Republican Party two seats. This list of cabinet members will be submitted to the National Assembly for approval. Since Marie has obtained the consent of the relevant parties, his passage is expected to be no problem. The difficulty that Marie had to overcome before presenting the final list was the differences of opinion with the Socialist Party on several points. According to informed sources, the Socialist Party does not agree with the nomination of Coste-Floret, a member of the People's Republican Party (erroneously written as Floret yesterday), as Minister of Overseas Territories. Here, it was previously believed that Pléven of the Democratic Socialist Union, a small party, was the most likely to take this position. The second point is the divergence of opinions on the candidates for the core cabinet. Marie originally planned to include two members of the Radical Socialist Party, two members of the Socialist Party, two members of the Popular Republican Party, and one member of the Independent Republican Party, but the Socialist Party had to strive for more representatives. After this concession, Marie finally agreed to include Socialist Minister of the Interior Moch and Radical Socialist Minister of Defense René Mayer. After this concession, the Socialist Party agreed to Coste-Floret as Minister of Overseas Territories. The most noteworthy thing is that former Foreign Minister Bidault failed to occupy a seat in the new cabinet. Previously, the outside world unanimously speculated that he would definitely occupy a seat among the ministers of state, but unexpectedly he was not included.</p>

This was the first setback for Syngman Rhee in the National Assembly since he was elected president last week, and also shows the strength of the various political parties in the Korean National Assembly. Yi Yun-yong is the vice-chairman of the Korean Democratic Party, which is actually an underground organization in North Korea. When Syngman Rhee nominated and recommended him, he said: "Yi Yun-yong is the leader in the hell of the north. Therefore, he will definitely do his best to unify the northern half, which is what we sincerely hope." Yi Yun-yong is not related to the extreme right-wing Korean Democratic Party, nor is he related to the moderate elements of the Kim Gu faction.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 26th, United Press] The United Nations Committee of Good Offices for Indonesia has rebuked the Dutch, stating that their armed forces have besieged the Republic of Indonesia, causing "serious" suffering to eighty million Indonesians. The Dutch currently have absolute control over Indonesia's trade, and their comprehensive blockade has resulted in a severe shortage of medicine, machinery, and other essential goods in the Republic of Indonesia. The Security Council is scheduled to study the reasons for the failure of mediation on the 27th. The Committee of Good Offices' report stated that the Dutch have besieged Indonesia throughout the six-month truce.</p>
<p>In its 2,000-word telegram, the Committee of Good Offices stated that the Dutch blockade of Indonesia is a clear violation of the agreement. This action has given the Dutch complete control over Indonesia, as all goods entering and leaving Indonesia require Dutch passports and must pass through Dutch checkpoints. All foreign exchange earned from exports is also taken by the Dutch. The vast majority of people in the Republic of Indonesia are now unable to engage in maritime trade, and different regions within the Republic of Indonesia are also unable to trade with each other.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations Security Council will reconvene on the 27th to consider the situation in Indonesia.</p>

Twelve suspected criminals were arrested in Shanghai and Qingdao, and the confirmed value of the supplies for the rebels is over hundreds of billions of yuan. In the Shanghai part of the case, the Electronic Surveillance Section of the Garrison Headquarters, based on confidential reports and clues obtained from breaking a secret radio station, learned that there was an organization of rebel transport agencies between Qingdao and Shanghai. Among those used by the rebels were soldiers, porters, sailors, and electrical material merchants who frequently traveled between Qingdao and Shanghai, using ships as transportation tools, searching for materials needed by the rebels in Shanghai, with wireless equipment being the largest. Others included Western medicines, etc., which were transported to Qingdao and sold at high prices to the rebel liaison personnel lurking in Qingdao, and then transported to the rebel areas near Qingdao.

Director Zhao Went to Nanjing Last Night to Consult with the Executive Yuan. <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] To save the crisis of public utilities in this city, the Municipal Government held a conference on maintaining Shanghai's public utilities in the conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu presided, and attendees included Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Ji, Luo Junshu, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially dispatched to Shanghai by the central government, Yu Bingjian, representative of the Ministry of Communications, Luo Zhan, technical expert of the Ministry of Interior, Xu Baowei of the US Aid Utilization Committee, E.T. Bell of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China, Zhang Xiwei, chairman of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Huo Shishu (representing Su Gongjun) of the Exporters Association, Mao Kegang of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Senators Xiang Changquan, Wang Zhuyi, Jiang Li, Shao Yongsheng, Tang Chengzong, Xu Xueyu, and Chu Shun, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, and representatives from various public utility companies.</p>
<p>Comparison of Various Index Increases</p>
<p>First, Mayor Wu clarified the significance of convening the meeting, followed by Director Zhao's report on the multiples of various index increases from January 1 to July 24 of this year: (1) US dollar exchange rate, 45.9 times; (2) Material oil, 37.2 times; (3) Heavy diesel, 34.5 times; (4) Medium diesel, 38.4 times; (5) Light diesel, 38.8 times; (6) Gasoline, 50 times; (7) Coal, 14.6 times; (8) Cost of living index, 14.5 times. The multiples of public utility increases are as follows: (1) Electricity, 8.5 times for those using 10 degrees or less, 11.4 times for those using 11 to 30 degrees, and 14.2 times for those using over 30 degrees; (2) Power, 13.1 times; (3) Water, 12.7 times. According to the above statistics, it is proved that the price of public utilities is actually less than the increase in prices, and various companies are almost unable to maintain their operations due to lack of working capital. At yesterday's meeting, representatives of Shanghai Electric Power, Telephone, French Concession Tram and Electric Light, Shanghai Waterworks, British Tram, and Inner City Waterworks, respectively, stated the difficulties of their companies before leaving to allow the municipal authorities to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Obtaining Loans from the Central Bank</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. Afterwards, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue reported the three remedial measures decided upon at the meeting: (1) Fuel oil and gasoline: US aid oil can be used starting in August, and the price should be adjusted once a month as the standard. Before that, it was agreed with President Yu to provide a one-time foreign exchange settlement for public utility oil and request the central government to exempt public utility oil from tariffs and import surcharges. (2) Coal prices are determined to be adjusted once a month in principle. The monthly supply of coal for Shanghai is limited to 45,900 tons. The required mine price and freight must be paid in full within three days after the monthly announcement. As for coal payments, if the company is unable to bear it, the Central Bank can lend the money. The payment method stipulates that coal from Kailuan be paid to the Central Trust Bureau for collection, coal from East China be paid to the Xuzhou branch of the Central Bank for collection, coal from Huainan be paid to the Bengbu branch of the Central Bank for collection, and coal from Taiwan be paid to the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Taiwan for collection. Coal supply is borne separately by various places, including 20,000 tons from Kailuan, 5,900 tons from East China, 10,000 tons from Huainan, and 10,000 tons from Taiwan. (3) Various special taxes, such as the Self-Defense Special Tax, are to be fixed by the Municipal Government telegraphing the North China authorities. There are also insurance fees and labor costs, etc., which account for about 10% and have not yet been fixed. The total coal payment is about 3 trillion, and a loan from the Central Bank is requested. The Central Bank has expressed its willingness to find ways to help. In the future, when various companies lack working capital, they can also request a loan from the Central Bank, which must be repaid within at least three months.</p>
<p>New Prices Announced on the First of Each Month</p>
<p>The most prolonged discussion concerned the issue of adjusting the sales prices of public utilities in August. In the past, the adjustment of prices for this month was based on an automatic method, in which the cost prices of various items were those announced in the previous month, resulting in greater losses for the company. It is now decided that the cost prices of various items will be determined in advance at the end of each month, and will remain unchanged for one month. As for the cost of living index and the hardware index, it is decided to first increase them by 50% based on what has already been reported this month. In this way, new prices for various public utilities can be announced simultaneously on the first of each month. Large users of electricity and water will be charged every half month. As for the company's request to adjust prices every half month, it was not approved in order to avoid stimulating price increases.</p>
<p>The new method for adjusting the prices of public utilities still needs to be approved by the central government before it can be implemented. Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight, carrying a written request for the Executive Yuan to approve the loan amounts for public utilities, which will then be lent by the Central Bank.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Arson and Burning of Pawnshop Case: Lu Zimei Prosecuted <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of the Qiaoxing Pawnshop on Fuxing Middle Road in this city being set on fire by employee Lu Zimei, resulting in the death of five people in the fire, has been concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office. He has been prosecuted for the crimes of endangering public safety and murder. The defendant had previously worked at the pawnshop for five years. Recently, due to the poor business of the shop, it was preparing to close down and had laid off several employees, including Lu. He initially received 4 million yuan in severance pay, followed by another 5 million yuan. The total amount was still insufficient for the defendant's travel expenses to return to his hometown in Sichuan. Although the defendant repeatedly requested an increase, he was ultimately rejected by Xu Songjia, the manager of the shop. At 4:00 AM on the 8th of this month, the defendant was lying alone in the shop on the ground floor, feeling anxious about his unemployment and even more resentful of the owner's ruthlessness. Overwhelmed by worry and resentment, he suddenly had an evil thought. He immediately opened two cans of kerosene, spilled it on old newspapers, and lit them. The flames shot straight up. By the time the defendant escaped from the shop and shouted in regret, it was too late to save the situation. Gao Jianqing, the assistant manager who lived upstairs, and his family members Gao Zhongding, Gao Yongsan, Gao Maomao, and maid Shi Jubao were unable to escape and all died. Most of the Qiaoxing Pawnshop was burned down. Knowing that his crime was unforgivable, the defendant surrendered himself to the Songshan Police Precinct and was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. The investigation has now concluded, and he has been prosecuted.</p>

Defendant Su Wanlei Remanded After Retrial Yesterday <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Su Wandang, the bodyguard of Li Xiaojin, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman from the Philippines, who was accused of kidnapping Li Antai, Li Xiaojin's eldest son, and extorting 1 million Philippine pesos, was sentenced by Judge Zhong Xianda of the Fifth Criminal Court of the District Court on March 6 of this year, after more than a year of arrest and investigation. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crime of assisting in kidnapping for ransom. The defendant appealed to the High Court through his defense lawyer Zheng Lin, arguing that the court had not considered the strong evidence of the withdrawal of the prosecution and the arrest warrant by the Philippine Prosecutor's Office. On April 24, Yi Zhiding, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the High Court, ruled that "the truth cannot be clarified without directly trying Li Antai in the case" and remanded the case for retrial. On the 12th of last month, Judge Ou Shenghe of the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court opened the trial and summoned Pei Nandis, a Philippine court defense lawyer who flew from the Philippines to Shanghai, and witness Xie Shiqing to testify. Yesterday afternoon, the case was retried in the District Court. The defendant's lawyer submitted the original text and translation of the Philippine Prosecutor's Office's withdrawal of the prosecution and the arrest warrant. The court stated that the person involved had not appeared in court and could not be tried, and instructed Yao Yongli, the lawyer representing the person involved, to telegraph Li Antai to return home to testify. The trial will be conducted again after Li arrives in Shanghai. The defendant remains in custody.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Training Work in Luoshan County <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Time News Reporter Zhai Nianji</p>
<p>After leaving Xinyang, as the truck entered Luoshan County, the first thing that caught my eye was the desolate fields on both sides of the road, and the weeds swaying in the morning breeze. Occasionally, there were remnants of walls and broken tiles, making people feel particularly desolate after the war.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Luoshan County was a contested area between the enemy and us. In the fierce seesaw battle, countless fields and villages were turned into rubble. Luoshan County, with a population of more than 300,000, had only 180,000 to 190,000 people left. After the victory, this place was repeatedly invaded by the communist bandits in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area, and resisted Liu Fei Bocheng's siege once. The situation of local destruction was even more serious. However, the local farmers, with the assistance and support of the government and the United Relief, perseveringly rebuilt their homes and country on the ruins. The closer the car got to the county seat, the more successful the land reclamation and reconstruction work became, which shows that under the large-scale destructive atrocities of the communist bandits, the people can only rely on the government's protection and political support to complete the reconstruction of the countryside. Recently, the population of Luoshan County has increased to 210,000 to 220,000.</p>
<p>Luoshan County is a rice-producing area in southeastern Henan. Luoshan rice not only supplies the heavily garrisoned Xinyang, but also a portion is transported to Hankou. The largest and most numerous businesses in the county seat are rice shops. The commercial vehicles on the Xinyang-Luoshan Highway mostly carry passengers to Luoshan and then carry rice back to Xinyang. The cars can make a round trip once a day, so the rice merchants will not suffer losses due to the price fluctuations in the Xinyang market. The owners of the commercial vehicles are already satisfied with the profits from the rice freight, and passengers are just "extra money." "Rice transportation" maintains the traffic between Xinyang and Luoshan, and promotes the prosperity of Luoshan County.</p>
<p>A Brave Team</p>
<p>Zhang Yulong, the magistrate of Luoshan County, was the deputy commander of the county's regular self-defense force in the past. He has been acting as the county magistrate for less than half a year. In the continuous harassment and attacks by the local communist bandit Luo Houfu in the Hubei-Henan border area, he has trained the self-defense force into a brave and good-fighting iron army. In the border areas of the bandit area, only military force can be used to protect politics, and politics can be used to develop the economy. Then, the overall strength of military, political, and economic forces can be used to suppress the bandits. Therefore, cultivating local armed forces is the most basic part of the pacification work.</p>
<p>The reporter had a three-hour conversation with Magistrate Zhang at the county government office. He told the reporter many valuable experiences about organizing and training local teams. He pointed out the two basic reasons that currently affect the combat effectiveness of local teams: one is that the commanders take advantage of vacancies, or use the vacancies to subsidize public funds; the other is that they assign the troops to county government and local miscellaneous affairs, such as urging recruits, urging payments, collecting grain, and collecting taxes. Moreover, some allocate soldiers of the troops to serve as orderlies for senior officials of the county government and local gentry. Therefore, he put forward the slogan of sufficient soldiers and sufficient food to the local public opinion organs. "Sufficient soldiers" means not taking advantage of vacancies and not assigning miscellaneous affairs, but concentrating on training soldiers and fighting wars. "Sufficient food" means that food and salaries must be allocated according to the actual number of people in the regular self-defense force. How to ensure that vacancies are not taken advantage of and prevent them from being taken advantage of? The method is that the photos of all team cadres and soldiers should be pasted on the roster, and the local council and fair gentry should count the names when distributing food and salaries. The team guarantees that there are no missing soldiers, and the local guarantees that there is no shortage of food. Sufficient soldiers and sufficient food are the minimum basic conditions for reorganizing and training local teams.</p>
<p>Magistrate Zhang also pointed out that in fighting with the communist bandits, it is necessary to deeply understand the bandit's guerrilla tactics. Only by understanding the enemy can we defeat the enemy. Moreover, guerrilla warfare is a tactic of dealing with superior equipment with inferior equipment. The equipment of local teams may not be better than that of the communist bandits, so they should also use the bandit's guerrilla tactics to attack the communist bandits. For example, mobile attacks are used to annihilate small groups of remnant bandits with superior forces and capture all their weapons and soldiers to supplement themselves. Another example is to use long-distance night marches to penetrate more than a hundred miles into the bandit area to eat up the local armed forces and small units of their rural public offices, as well as to use the communist bandits' usual tactics such as flanking maneuvers. Therefore, the main content of the training is the communist bandits' guerrilla tactics. In combat, they should be given back to them in the same way. This has caused Luo Fei Houfu to suffer great losses repeatedly on the border of Luoshan.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of County Training Work</p>
<p>The regular self-defense force is a pillar of law and order, while the mass self-defense force is the bricks and tiles that build it. The mass self-defense force is the total gathering of manpower in the county. It is the eyes and ears of the regular self-defense force and the most powerful helper. The application of guerrilla tactics depends on whether the mass organization and training are strict or not. Therefore, organizing and training the mass self-defense force, which holds knives, sticks, spears, and spears, and is responsible for communication, intelligence, checking, and sentry, is a great force to eliminate potential bandits in the territory and cooperate with the regular force in combat. Therefore, the organization and training of Luoshan's mass self-defense force and the organization and training of the regular force are equally important and carried out in coordination.</p>
<p>In order to consolidate the law and order of the entire county, Magistrate Zhang completed the five phases of the county political training class in one phase. The training of more than one hundred trainees in the county training institute was not carried out in the classroom, but a township was designated, and then the training was carried out step by step according to the training subjects that should be carried out in each Jia and Bao. That is, the trainees are trained in practice. This is tantamount to a large working group. On the one hand, it can play a demonstrative role in the training work, and on the other hand, it has thoroughly completed the work of checking household registration, organizing Baojia, clearing land, and eliminating traitors. This is a feature of Luoshan County's training work.</p>
<p>The Serious Land Problem</p>
<p>The serious situation of Luoshan's desolate land was the reporter's first impression when he stepped into Luoshan County. According to Magistrate Zhang, after the victory, "United Relief" had carried out land reclamation work on both sides of the highway. After the end of United Relief, the Fifth Appeasement District Headquarters coordinated with the Luoshan County Government to organize a land reclamation brigade and handle immigration, but the lack of manpower and financial resources still could not solve the problem of wasteland. In this situation of vast land and sparse population, land distribution should not be a problem. However, according to the results of the reporter's visit to the countryside, the landlords in Bashan County still collect land rent from the tenant farmers at a rate of five-five division. Because the landlords not only hold the ownership of the land, but also hold the agricultural tools and power necessary for cultivation. Because they occupy land and means of production, they can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor without working. Therefore, the land problem in the Appeasement District [should] be [the] main content, one is how to reclaim wasteland, two is how to carry out rent reduction and interest reduction to improve the lives of individual farmers, and three is how to re-reasonably distribute land and abolish the tenancy system. Wasteland reclamation and expansion [are] limited to human and financial resources and must be done gradually. Land reform must be implemented after the government promulgates laws and regulations. However, rent reduction and interest reduction can be realized immediately as long as the local governments are determined. The problem lies in how to overcome the obstruction of the local land rights and the understanding and confidence of the local magistrate in rent reduction.</p>

<p>[Report from our Qingpu correspondent on the 26th] Recently, bandits have been active in the strategically important Sao Gouan area of the Qingxi Waterway, and robbery cases have been frequently reported. On the night of the 25th, when the Zhujiege and Anzhuang Township People's Defense Teams went to search the area, they encountered the People's Defense Team patrolling in nearby Xicen Township. Because there was no prior communication, the two sides mistakenly identified each other as bandits in the dark, and a fierce battle lasted for about an hour before they realized the misunderstanding. However, Guo Hengbin, a member of the Xicen People's Defense Team, was killed on the spot by a machine gun, and one member of the Xicen Water Team was seriously injured. A civilian ship was also damaged. The county government has sent personnel to Baodi to investigate this unfortunate incident of misunderstanding in bandit suppression.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Wujin, this Newspaper, 25th] The cost for each national identification card issued by the government is 35,000 yuan. The county magistrate ordered all villages to complete collection by the end of this month. Those who fail to meet the deadline will be fined an additional 10,000 yuan. The common people calculate that, including the photo and other expenses, each person will have to pay at least 200,000 yuan or more. For families with several members, it is truly difficult.</p>
<p>According to unofficial estimates from the government, the scattered bandits, such as Zhang Zhiqiang and others, who frequently roamed the border areas of Wujin's four townships, number no more than forty or fifty, at most no more than two hundred. The number of troops participating in the suppression of bandits, including the National Army, provincial and county security teams, and civilian self-defense forces, is more than ten times that number. Despite repeated deadlines for complete elimination, the suppression remains incomplete. On the 23rd, a batch of bandit ammunition was found on the body of a Bodhisattva in the Xishe Temple in Lincheng Township, at the border of Wucheng: seventeen sticks of dynamite, one smoke grenade, and one pound of explosives, were taken to the county for investigation.</p>
<p>In previous conscriptions in Changzhou, the settlement allowance borne by the people ranged from 10 to 30 shi of rice per person. Averaging 20 shi of rice per person, the total amount has exceeded the annual land tax of the entire county.</p>
<p>The overdue taxes for the 35th and 36th years are being actively urged and collected. The prison grain in the new prison is depleted, and prisoners are being released on parole for reform as much as possible!</p>

Normal school students receive special treatment from the state and must serve the country after graduation, unlike ordinary students. Even those in normal colleges or universities should be subject to special and strict supervision and training, and any undisciplined behavior should be severely punished. The current tolerance and leniency towards normal school students in various schools is harmful to the nation and the people, and also harms the normal school students themselves.

<p>[Our Report] According to a report published in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post on the 27th, the Chinese World Cup basketball star Li Shiqiao is currently ill in Singapore and was unable to travel to London with the team. Shiqiao is scheduled to rush there before the games, but it is not yet known if he will be able to make it. This news was revealed by Huang Tianxi, who also said that the basketball team is currently in intensive training, and even if Li Shiqiao can arrive before the games, the Chinese team has suffered a great loss. For this reason, our reporter specially inquired with relevant parties in the city yesterday, hoping to obtain some information about Li Shiqiao's actual situation, but none of the relevant parties could confirm this. However, it is true that Li Shiqiao is ill in Singapore. It is unheard of that he did not go to London. In recent days, the Central News Agency's reports from Singapore and London have not mentioned it. We can only wait for more detailed reports. However, according to the Central News Agency's report from London, the Chinese basketball team lost to Egypt, and Shiqiao was not there, which may also be a reason, but the telegram did not mention it at all. The English-language Shanghai Evening Post also stated that Gao Lan athlete Huang Liangzheng suffered from severe toothache.</p>

<h3 id="e145">A Talk on Denture Experience <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>When a person reaches fifty, they are left with seventeen teeth, loose and shaky, unfit for use. Upon the diligent advice of Dr. Yi Zhaoxue, the dentist, all were extracted, and a full set of dentures was fitted. Fortunately, Dr. Yi's skills are highly refined, and there was no pain during the extraction. The dentures fitted are also aesthetically pleasing and natural to use, capable of chewing stir-fried soybeans and peanuts. However, for the first month after fitting, there was some discomfort. Only afterward did I realize that this "discomfort" was entirely due to "unfamiliarity." With patient use for a month, one will definitely find it completely comfortable due to "habit." I deeply fear that those without this experience will lament the hardship and difficulty at first, regretting it before it's too late, or blaming the dentist for not fitting them well. Therefore, I am sharing my own experience to inform fellow sufferers. For I myself initially lamented the hardship, regretted it, and doubted Dr. Yi Zhaoxue's skills when I first had my dentures fitted; only after a month did I realize it was all unjust grievance, and I felt apologetic and infinitely grateful. The reasons why "habit" can make dentures comfortable are stated below:</p>
<p>Dentures are based on the gums, with teeth-like hard objects attached to the gums. In normal people, the duty of the gums is to support the teeth, making the teeth grow firmly in the mouth like tree trunks. Therefore, the gums are strongest at the roots of the teeth and very weak on the surface. When picking teeth with a toothpick, using too much force can sometimes cause the surface of the gums to bleed. This is proof that the surface of the gums is very weak. As long as the gums at the roots of the teeth use their strength to hold the teeth, the teeth can exert force to bite hard things.</p>
<p>Now that you have extracted all your teeth, the gums at the roots of the teeth no longer need to fulfill the duty of support. Let the gums on the surface contract and fill the holes from the extractions, and then resist the hard base of the dentures. In this way, the strong part of the gums resigns its duty, while the weak part takes on a heavy responsibility. It is like a person who has always been idle suddenly taking on a heavy job, definitely feeling very painful! So on the first day dentures are fitted, when you chew tightly, the upper and lower gums are oppressed by the base, causing great pain. Fearing the pain, you can only avoid chewing tightly; without chewing tightly, even rice grains cannot be crushed, let alone hard objects. At this time, you will regret the extractions and blame the dentist for incompetence. Becoming impatient, you remove the newly fitted dentures, preferring to gnaw rice with your gums. But this is a temporary expedient, not a good solution. Because if this continues, you will never wear the dentures, and then you will truly regret it. I tell you, the first two or three days of fitting are a crucial juncture. These two or three days require the greatest patience. During these two or three days, you can only eat soft things. If you eat vegetarian food, tofu, bean curd sheets, fermented bean curd, sesame paste, peanut butter, etc., can all be eaten. If you eat meat, eggs, fish slices, braised pork, etc., can all be eaten, and the nutrition is not lacking. Temporarily avoid bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and ribs such as chicken, duck, and pork. What does it matter?</p>
<p>Enduring for three days, on the fourth day you will definitely be able to eat slightly harder things. My experience is to eat walnuts. Walnuts are harder than rice, softer than peanuts, and I think they are the most suitable test material. Chew slowly. Take a small piece of walnut the size of a soybean and carefully place it in the middle of the molars, have the molars bite down, and then chew tightly. One, two, three, four, chew at the same speed as the movements of calisthenics. Eventually, the walnut will be chewed to pieces, and you will feel the fragrant, oily, and smooth taste. This is the first tribute you receive from dentures, the beginning of sweetness after hardship. Besides walnuts, dry biscuits and pastries (such as Zhuangyuan Pastry, Xiang Pastry) are also good test materials. Chewing them makes a "sasha" sound, which can also enhance the power of dentures. Guided by walnuts, biscuits, pastries, and other things, slowly eat harder things. After a month or two, you can eat peanuts and stir-fried soybeans.</p>
<p>I have been wearing dentures for more than half a year now, and I am completely accustomed to them, using them naturally, unable to distinguish them from real teeth. Here I have realized a point: the number of organs in the human body is not fixed. If from ancient times God had only given people one hand and one foot, people would have become accustomed and satisfied, and would not demand two hands and two feet. Similarly, if from ancient times God had not given people a nose, and people had never smelled fragrances and odors, they would have become accustomed and satisfied, and would not demand a nose. From a more positive perspective, if from the beginning God had given people an extra organ on their heads called X, and this X could hear distant sounds, like a modern radio, people would become accustomed to this organ and consider it something they should naturally have, and consider its absence a disease. If from ancient times God had given people a pair of wings on their backs, allowing them to take off at any time, like modern airplanes, people would become accustomed to this organ and consider it something they should naturally have, and consider its absence a disability. It can be seen that the organs of the human body can be more or less, originally without a fixed number. Therefore, people who are missing an eye are as sensitive as we are after getting used to it. People who are missing a leg walk as fast as we do after getting used to it. I have seen people with only two fingers on each hand, who can still pick things up, write, and even play the piano because they are used to it. I have met people with no hands at all, who can actually count banknotes and play dominoes with their toes because they are used to it. It can be seen that the number of organs in the human body is not fixed, and it becomes natural after getting used to it. Suppose from the beginning God had not created teeth for people, and teeth had to be fitted by a craftsman, then I would be an ordinary healthy person, because I can chew things just like you!</p>
<p>I often think like this, so I am very satisfied with my dentures. So I wrote down this experience and thoughts and hung it in Dr. Yi Zhaoxue's clinic, and widely informed fellow sufferers in the world. (July of the thirty-seventh year in Hangzhou.)</p>

<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>In the spring, the fish in the tank all spawn, and watching them go from breaking out of the egg to birth, it doesn't take long for them to gradually grow from a mosquito larva-like size. However, the development of small fish varies in speed. If you let them live and die on their own, and the fish food—water fleas—is not provided sufficiently, they will engage in the survival of the fittest, and the larger ones will devour those smaller than themselves. Fish have no spiritual awareness. Whether they are of the same kind, the same clan, or even eating from the same container, they only want to fill their stomachs for their own benefit, prolong their lives temporarily, and disregard everything else.</p>
<p>The goldfish in the tank can sometimes be caught and selected by people to separate them by size, putting the large ones with the large ones and the small ones with the small ones, so that they can live in peace for a while.</p>
<p>The small fish in the tank are like this, and so are the fish and shrimp in the rivers and seas. Fortunately, aquatic creatures grow and flourish abundantly, so even with such mutual slaughter, they still reproduce endlessly. The survival of the fittest is indeed the principle of natural selection. Please look at the international arena and society. In all the places where people interact with each other, where is the survival of the fittest and mutual slaughter not revealed?</p>
<h3 id="e147">Skimming Oil <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Suobei</p>
<p>Skimming oil is actually malfeasance. If the four large characters on the roof of the International Hotel were still around, skimming oil would be a huge stain on individuals and society; however, according to recent urban sentiments, skimming oil seems to have been recognized by everyone as "normal human behavior." Those who are slightly worldly-wise will probably not raise objections because shops evade stamp duties or ticket sellers do not give tickets; moreover: "This isn't skimming your oil! What business is it of yours?" Furthermore: "Life is so expensive!" Shanghai dialect calls this kind of person who is good at understanding human emotions and knowledgeable of the world as "luo kan" or "shixiang."</p>
<p>As a result, skimming oil became popular in Shanghai after the victory, from bottom to top. Authoritative institutions unanimously (or successively) refused to pay various fees such as water, electricity, gas, and telephone from August of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China; and because they can continue to enjoy these services without paying fees, they use them without reservation and extremely lavishly; therefore, when this bill is calculated today, it has already dragged more than a dozen circles below the character "one" (this number has not been calculated according to the past currency value indexed).</p>
<p>The company authorities have two magic weapons: sacrificing the weak and appeasing people. You skim oil, I raise prices; I added a line of red text to the bills of citizen users: "If not paid before a certain date in a certain month, supply will be stopped immediately without further notice." Thus, the problem was solved, from victory to this day.</p>
<p>The company's view on skimming oil is also somewhat similar to the general public's view on ticket sellers skimming oil: "You skim oil! Anyway, you can't skim it from me. Why not be generous with other people's money?"</p>
<h3 id="e148">"Jiejie" and "Zijie" <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Students often write "jiejie" when referring to their older sisters in their papers. Someone asked me if the characters "jie" and "zi" are interchangeable. I said that as long as a character is used habitually, there is no need to ask whether they are interchangeable. For example, the "ball" in "piqiu" (leather ball) originally had the "mao" (fur) radical, while the "yu" (jade) radical means "jade"; however, no one is heard saying "qiu" now, which is clear evidence. Moreover, "jie" is seen in Zhai Hao's Common Customs Compilation of the Qing Dynasty, which says: "In recent times, older sisters are called jie," which is like "die" and "ba," why delve into it! As for "zi," it is seen in Shuowen, because Master Xu's book is the orthodox source of characters, so people always abide by it, even to this day.</p>
<p>Adding "xiao" (little) before "jie" to call someone "xiaojie" (miss) is especially fashionable now, like flight attendants and so on, which are countless. According to Qian Weiyan's Jade Hall Encounter Records, there was a palace servant in charge of tea and wine named Han Xiaojie. The term "xiaojie" first appeared here, but it is a person's name, not a title. The following sentences are quite incomprehensible, because Han is her surname, and xiaojie is clearly a title rather than a person's name. Qian was a person of the Song Dynasty, so the term "xiaojie" already existed as a title in the Song Dynasty. To say it even more "anciently," Fan Qin and Cao Pi's Letter to Shi Nu has the phrase "Shina jiejie," which notes that she was a musician at the time. Kai Tian Yi Shi: Prince Ning had a courtesan named Jie. Tao Yi's Qing Yi Lu has Pingkang prostitute Zui Jie, and Su Shi's Collection includes courtesan Yang Jie, all of which are seen in the Common Customs Compilation. Based on this, the title "jie" was already common between the Wei and Tang Dynasties. Adding "xiao" before "jie" is nothing more than expressing petite intentions. Therefore, the Ming Dynasty poet Zhu Youdun has the line "Three-inch lotus shoes revealed before the curtain, knowing that the tender miss has come." "Tender" is the name, "miss" is the title. The Common Customs Compilation considers "jie to be a very lowly term, and only daughters of noble families can be called that, which is contradictory." This is an outdated view, because calling young women "jie" or "xiaojie" is like calling "mei" (younger sister) or "xiaomei" (little sister), and is not exclusive to daughters of noble families. I wonder if readers think so.</p>
<p>The term "zijie" appears in poetry, as seen in Tang Dynasty Sima Biao Sheng's poem: "Elder sister teaches people to hold the child."</p>

<p>Quinine is most effective for treating malaria, but unfortunately, its taste is very bitter. Accidentally crushing the sugar coating is simply unbearably bitter. Soviet scientists, in view of this, have already been feeding quinine (plants) to bees. Patients only need to eat the honey produced by these bees to treat the disease, and there is no bitter taste.</p>
<p>The average lifespan of a car produced in recent years is twelve years, and it can be driven 100,000 miles.</p>
<p>Although the United States is experiencing a housing shortage, the trend of moving is not declining. In the eight years since 1940, 12 million people have moved from one state to another; 13 million have remained in the same state but moved to another county; and 44 million have moved within the same county. In other words, in a short period of less than ten years, almost half of the entire population of the United States has moved.</p>
<p>At the upcoming World Games in London, there will be a special camera at the finish line of the track events that can carefully photograph the order in which each athlete arrives at the moment they cross the white line, without any ambiguity.

<h3 id="e150">Dwelling in the Lower Reaches <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Confucius said in the Analects, "The wickedness of Zhou was not as extreme as that; therefore the superior man hates to dwell in the lower reaches, to which all the wickedness in the world will flow." Zigong was a wise man, and Confucius approved of him as someone who could discuss poetry with. Pondering these words, I also know that he could discuss history. What the term "lower reaches" refers to is not easy to explain in detail, but it means anything that can be blamed. This is a different meaning from the "dwelling in the lower reaches" among the four evils of the superior man. Zhou was unkind, but not extremely wicked. If not for Zigong, who would clear his name? Historical writing is not always impartial, and people's words often exaggerate evil. Moreover, the world still has those who are not unkind but merely bear the name, and people hate them because of their name, so they attribute all the wickedness in the world to them. Therefore, the superior man knows this and always refrains from doing certain things. Yi Yin governed by advancing, and caused chaos by advancing. He went to Tang five times and to Jie five times. The situation was extremely dangerous, but fortunately, the ancients were forgiving and praised him for being able to take on responsibility. Otherwise, if he was charged with being an accomplice to evil once, and with being fickle twice, and was thoroughly purged, with his merits not making up for his faults, would he still be able to be called a sage? This is why Confucius did not become the ruler of Wei, and ultimately did not attach himself to Gongshan Buliao or Fufou, and had discussions about avoiding the world, avoiding places, avoiding lust, and avoiding words. Zigong made his fortune by trading without being commanded, truly seeing that politics cannot be forced. Only Yan Hui was happy in poverty. Ran Qiu accumulated wealth for the Ji family, increasing the grain levy twofold compared to other days. Although he was not enriching himself, he could not escape the attacks that were as loud as beating drums, which is also an example of dwelling in the lower reaches.</p>

<p>— Original by Tennyson, Translated by Bi</p>
<p>Moss, how deep! Covering all the flower mounds. Pear blossoms on the wall, Falling nails producing red rot. The dilapidated house, colors bleak, Door sills daily in the door. Carved upon it, a lone warehouse is seen, Upon the warehouse, all 　　.</p>
<p>Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. Evening dew produces tear drops, When the dew dries, tears come again, All day the sky is clear, But the heart fears to look. In the dusk bats fly, Faintly entering the long dusk, But drawing the small chain, Gazing fixedly towards the dark crossing.</p>
<p>Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. In the middle of the night, unable to sleep, Night birds sounding solemnly. The rooster crows, the morning is still far, In the dark pond, a calf's moo is heard. Thinking that life is ended, like what? Like a lonely traveler spending the night. Until the cold wind comes, Dawn light rises upon the cut-off roof.</p>
<p>Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. Moss stains on the wall, deep, The water in the ditch outside the wall, black; The white poplar tree at the corner of the wall, Standing alone, empty on all sides. The four sides, how vast, Cold sun pressing near! Frost skin covering the branches, Pale, as its color.</p>
<p>Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. The bright moon sinks to the great corner, High wind 　distant scholars. Asking the woman what she sees? A plain curtain dancing empty. A good night 倐口 already broken, Turning 　entering the rugged slope; Dust bed extending tree shadows, White poplar tree crossing the brows.</p>
<p>Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. The door sill echoes the chamber, Green flies sing on the window screens, Wall rats whistle, In the hole, looking 睊睊. Passing light crosses the door gap, As if the face of an old person; Belly sounds in the high building, Cries issue in the front yard.</p>
<p>Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler long not coming; Considering life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass. The clock slowly ticks, Migratory birds chirp in the beams; Moreover, the white poplar wind, Rustling, makes the heart rebel. Zhu Yang suddenly declines to the west, Red cheeks increasingly embarrassed! Remaining light enters the chamber, In the middle, traces of tiny dust are seen……</p>
<p>Looking up and down, the heart is wounded, The traveler never comes. Long crying, life exhausted, Wishing to wither before the autumn grass!</p>
