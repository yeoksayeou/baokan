<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕平綏路東段主力拚戰，國軍已獲大捷。華北剿總發表：國軍十四日晚南北兩路會師於靑龍橋，並派隊駐守岔道，三堡，西撥子等地。聶榮臻匪部第二兵團（包括四縱隊·二縱隊第四旅·獨一·獨七兩旅，新七·新八兩師。）傾全力向以上地區猛撲，戰事激烈異常，備極驚駭危急，每一山頭皆經拉鋸爭奪，戰車延續，至十五日下午二時，匪全綫崩潰，向東北脫退，其二從隊第四旅幾全部被殲滅，其他匪部亦因此次全部戰役歷時三畫夜，傷亡極重大，國軍刻正綱續追擊中。</p>
<p>作作義暢談獲勝經過</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕傅總司令作義，於剿總政工處邀平記者赴西山秋遊後，特在西郊總部招待晚餐，並在會中發表平綏東段國軍獲勝戰報，口述戰爭情形稱：有一個最好消息，乙是捕捉了匪軍第二后團而予以潰滅性打擊。幾個月來，共匪色力避免與國軍主力決戰，乘隙蹈虛，到處竄擾，企圖達到他以大吃小的迷夢；因此，國軍幾個月來，雖也不斷作戰，而究未捕捉到匪之主力，予以澈底的聚殲，最近在共匪所謂秋季攻勢呌囂中，華北一部國軍增調胡蘆島，同時，因聶榮臻第三兵團及原晋綏軍區，北岳軍區姚喆，康健民之赤軍，黃立淸·楊嘉瑞等匪，與新編第八縱隊合力竄擾察綏，國軍大部又在西調大就在這時候，我們却故意在平綏東段露出一大空隙，這個空隙就是平津與察綏交通咽喉而屏障北平的最險峻最關重要的平張段織路的南起居庸關，北至康莊的關溝一段，誘致共匪來上鈎。爲了這一目的，國軍曾撤守了幾個縣城據點，地方團隊及保安部隊也曾有八九百至一千餘的損失。</p>
<p>大家知道，在這一段地區地形最險要，在軍事歷史上，形勢也最開重要。國軍所留的力量極少，又是山地，共匪一向認爲山地是他們的，國軍不慣於山地戰，又需夜間作戰，共匪自以爲夜間又是他們的，國軍不長於夜間戰，在這一段地區，補給上又極其不便，空軍也不易偵察助戰，所以在共匪認爲一切條件均與他有利而不利於國軍，自以爲是絕好機會，就拿出聶榮臻主力第二兵團二三四縱隊及獨一，獨七，兩旅，與冀察熱邊區詹大南所屬新七新八兩師，上了這個鈎，齊力向這一地區進犯，並佔據了最險要的制高點，八達嶺，及其附近山形。當戰爭進行到最緊張最高度時，我們不管軍事的人聽到這消息，內心非常驚憂担心，固然不如此不能誘致匪來，但使如果運用不當，前途實不敢想像了。幸某軍長親自指揮，由南口北進，某軍長行動超速，由康莊南下，國軍適合機宜，尤其我空軍同志日夜不斷的出動助戰，完成了常人所不能完成的任務，將士用命，戰友勇敢，忍讓忍苦，三日三夜的拉鋸爭奪舊戰的結果，截止今日下午二時，將匪全部擊潰，並將匪之第四旅及數地區之匪完令聚　，無一漏網，匪棄屍遍佈山頭山溝之間，槍支彈藥遺棄遍地，國軍一部現正淸掃戰塲，派汽車拉運俘擄，淸查戰果，大部國軍則分向匪逃竄之東北方向猛烈澈底進擊中。這一戰役，可說是最驚險最困難中的勝利，也是幾個月來最痛快的。我想匪軍也可知道山地戰與夜問戰並不是他們的，相反的，山地和夜間同是屬於國軍的，</p>

<p>〔本報潘陽十五日電〕錦州市區中心十五日火光熊熊，各大據點附近仍有戰事，老城古搭屹立，國軍堅守，此爲上午飛機空中偵察之報吿。另據此問所獲消息，匪衆練由市區東南及西北兩方竄入市內，巷戰益烈，尤以車站以南警備司令部一帶最兇惡。市區西北高地省府，市中心之車站</p>
<p>市東區之鐵路局，兵站總監部及大學先修班一帶，十五日午仍有戰事，證明守軍仍在英勇作戰。十五日拂曉，飛機尙看到雙方正激烈砲戰，空軍曾對匪後續部隊大施轟炸。匪攻錦州使用兵力十萬人，斃傷於炸彈下者爲數至夥，十五日暮色蒼茫中、空軍藉地面火光，尙作與地面設法聯絡之努力。錦州戰事或將稍間歇，葫蘆島援軍續向高橋逼進。此間某大員曾一度飛往指示，又，錦州匪有抽調轉犯錦西跡象。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕我方機羣十五日分批飛錦州外圍對匪作有效轟炸，錦州東西及東北三公里，城東南半里處，北大營東南等處陣地，經我機猛炸毀匪工事十餘處，城防趨穩，塔山東三公里鐵路東之河灣南側陣地內伏匪甚多，我機密排掃射，斃匪頗衆，錦州南劉家屯河邊匪陣地經發現後，斃匪四十餘。</p>

<h3 id="c22">聨合國能解決柏林問題嗎？ <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會爲打開優局，將柏林問題移至幕後談判，休會了一星期，又於十五日起，開始辯論柏林問題了。在休會的一星期內，六個中立國的代表雖已盡了極大的努力，從中調處，欲使柏林危機和平解决；但其結果，不僅未能打開柏林事件的僵局，而且雙方的態度愈談愈强硬。西方盟國堅持着先解除對鎖後開談判的主張，蘇聯則要求先將柏林問題自安理會議程內撤消，然後談判解决柏林危機；雙方相持不下，只有在安理會內攤牌了。英美法三國代表於十四日會議，共商對安理會所當提出的决議案，似乎要迫令安理會於數日內卽採取行動。蘇聯卽使不退出聯合國，但在安理會內必將行使其否决權，使安理會不能成立任何决議，殆無疑義。所以，安理會能否解决這個棘手的問題，已成爲世人注視巴黎聯合國大會的焦點了。</p>
<p>安全理事會自十月四日起，就開始處理英美法三國對蘇聯對鎖柏林的控訴，世人無不替聯合國能否通過這一嚴重的考騐而着急。起初蘇聯代表維辛斯基以「聯合國討論柏林事件違背波茨坦協定」爲理由，反對將柏林事件列入安全理事會議程，後來安全理事會不顧蘇聯代表的反對，仍通過議案，將柏林事件列入議程；蘇聯代表又宣佈决不參加此項討論，烏克蘭代表也聲明决與蘇聯代表同進退，頓使安理會陷於左右兩難的困境。惟安理會內的六個中立國爲打開柏林問題的僵局計，同時也爲聯合國的前途計，一致主張安理會暫時休會，將柏林問題移至慕後討論，俾由各中立國代表在會外接觸，覓取折衷方案，一則可使柏林問題和平解決，再則可使安理會免除這一個嚴重的考騐。故在安理會休會的七天內，妥協的希望不絕如縷，重開和談的呼聲也甚囂塵上。中立國建議「一面解除柏林的封鎖，一面四强進行談判」，頗有爲雙方接受的可能。但是四强的外交家在巴黎繞了幾個圈子，一切的希望又復歸於幻滅。當美國務卿馬歇爾返國述職回到巴黎的時候，西方盟國就决定放棄與蘇聯妥協的在　企圖、迫令安理會對柏林問題　取行動，使六個中立國代表也不得不放棄其調處柏林問題的在　計劃。安理會於十五日復會，自然也只好依照其預定的議程，處理這一個最感棘手的問題了。</p>
<p>據外交界消息靈通人士的推測，西方門國與蘇聯攤牌，將採取下列三項步驟：（一）在安理會中，控訴蘇聯封鎖柏林足以威脅世界和平，雖明知蘇聯代表必將行使否決權，但仍强求安全理事會有所表示。（二）在聯合國大會中，英國代表將首先發言，譴責蘇聯使戰後世界陷於杌隍不安的狀態之中，並指出蘇聯提議世界裁軍，各國减少三分之一，亦無誠意可言。（三）在聯合國大會中，以絕大多數的擁護，通過美國所提出的原子能管制計劃，而宣佈蘇聯爲成立原子能管制制度的唯一障碍。事情果眞照這樣發展下去，勢必引起蘇聯的退出聯合國，對於柏林問題的解决仍無實際效用可言，徒然造成聯合國機構的破裂而已。這眞使我們對於聯合國的前途，表示無限的焦慮！</p>
<p>純以法理而論，英美法以柏林事件訴諸安理會主以考騐聯合國機構的實際功效，本是不可非議的。但按之聯合國機構　特質，它　基礎，完全建築在國際的團給合作，唯有在列强意見一致的前提之下，才能和平解决問題：否則列强的意見紛歧，只要有，國表示不同意，不論她行使否决權也好，或是退出聯合國機構也好，都可以促成聯合國機構的解體，更加顯示出世界的分裂。所以凡是　正愛護聯合國的人，都是不贊成將列强問的任何糾紛移交聯合國處理的。卽以柏林問題而論，在東西兩集團各趨極端的情形之下，安理會不論採取何種行動，都是解决不了柏林的危機，反將要引起聯合國的困難，它的弱點也爲之暴露無遺，徒然粉碎了人類對於世界和平的唯一希望；這是何等的不智！</p>
<p>在人心渴望和平的今日，大家都要忍耐，從互認中求得諒解，在諒解中謀得大同，這才是眞正愛護聨合國之道。否則各趨色端，不惜走上分裂的道路，聯合國也要喪失了代表全世界的意義，而將與舊國際聯盟遭遇同一命運。</p>

<p>渠並毫不容情地痛斥猶太兇手之暗殺貝氏誠卑劣之至。彭契認爲如聯大能提出合理之一般解決方案、阿拉伯猶太雙方均可望同章，渠　，雙方雖怨仇甚深、惟均希望和平，蓋戰爭代價太大而礙及雙方社會之正常發展。渠稱，聯大應對基本問題，諸如猶太國家，其邊界，國際保證巴境居民之權利，阿拉伯難民，及聯合國繼續注意聖地等，發表見解。然詳盡之藍樣則大可不必。聯大應任雙方在大事上根據聯大决定而自行解決細則。彭契復引貝那多特之籲請以實體方案替代停戰令之言論爲言稱，一且戰端復啓，後果不堪設想，不唯中東卽舉世之和平亦將受其威脅。彭氏警令各國承認猶太國之春在。彭契言畢，阿拉伯代表卽展開攻擊，叙黎代表指斥以色列應負暗殺貝那多之責。最後以色列代表艾本宣稱，薛托克外畏將於下週有詳　聲明發表，說明該國爲何反對貝那多特之解決方案並將向安理會報吿有關貝那多特被殺害之調查詳况。該會至十一時半休會，下次召開日期未定。</p>

<p>〔本報靑島十日訊〕濟南綏區司令部第三處作戰科長李泉，於匪突入濟垣後，卽隱蔽民間，廿八日始由濟脫險，間關抵靑。征塵甫卸，卽晤記者，與談濟南作戰經過詳情。自濟南失陷後，道途傳聞，頗有出入，至於部署作戰經過全般態勢，非直接參加作戰之指揮部中人員不能深知，此爲軍事上必然情形，故過去各種片面報吿，其材料或獲諸國防部或徐州指揮所方面，或未具體。李泉爲惟一自指揮部中脫險來靑者，方作戰之時，裏助參謀長羅莘理，鎭守綏區司令部，總攪全爲，故其所談，當爲當時之最眞確情形也。茲錄李泉將軍談話如下：</p>
<p>「匪軍圍攻濟南，使用兵力爲第三·第七·第九·第十·第十三·新入·渤海·兩廣·快速等九個縱隊，及地方軍區部隊卅萬，可稱傾其全魯兵力來犯。其中七·九·十三·渤海·快速·爲匪之精銳，俱爲三個師編制，攻我東正面，新八縱隊攻我鐵路正面，黃河以北爲兩廣縱隊，長淸及鐵路南爲第三·第十兩縱隊，俱爲兩個師編制，係豫東會戰殘餘。</p>
<p>國軍爲第二師，（計共三個旅，）第七三師，（計三個旅）第八四師吳化文師，（計一五五旅，一六一旅，獨立旅等三個旅，）此外復有由濰縣突圍保安團隊編成之三個保安旅，守備城垣，戰力與裝備俱差，而七四師兩個營，則孫由空運到達者。</p>
<p>當戰事初起時，除晏子風部在長淸洛口各守一個旅外，濟區防務，大致係由洛上劃一縱綫，分劃東西兩區，由曹振鐸吳化文兩個師部分別負靑指揮。三個師各控制一個旅爲機動部隊。</p>
<p>外團戰鬥情形</p>
<p>茲先就外圍的戰鬥作一概述：陳匪自本年六月攻陷兗州後，卽積極作進犯濟南凖備，爲時三月，於上（九）月十四日，仍採其一貫之聲東擊西戰法，先以兩廣縱隊於黃河北岸，第三第十縱隊向長淸，新八縱隊沿津浦路正面，繼以最精銳之第七·第九·十三·渤海·快速五個縱隊向濟垣東郊猛犯，濟南守備戰幕序於焉展開。旋經發覺匪之企圓，經激烈戰鬥後，於十五日濟南西正面外圍之齊河長淸等處據點逐次放棄，向濟垣外圍旣設陣地轉移。（部署陣地如附圖）</p>
<p>十六日黃昏後，匪開始向城東郊茂岑山硯池山陣地猛攻，匪先以猛烈砲火轟擊，繼以步兵猛衝，激戰澈夜，守軍傷亡殆盡陸匪。守軍營長朱光華以作戰不力槍決。十七日匪向旬柳莊進攻，戰鬥更形慘烈，守軍均抱與陳地共存亡決心，激戰竟日，守軍十五旅四五團全部壯烈犧牲，團長李璞負傷以手榴彈自殺。十八日匪續西犯馬家莊，經調十九五七兩旅增援，尤以馬家莊爭奪戰最爲激烈，匪我各據一半，經四畫夜血戰，匪以傷亡甚重，攻勢稍挫，東正面戰局漸趨穩定。至此日爲止，國軍外圍戰，全在東正面，初步固守計劃，業已完成。據凖確判斷，匪精銳第九縱隊已傷亡殆盡。其餘部隊亦受損極重。匪我相距僅一二百公尺。</p>
<p>十九日午後六時突據吳化文部一五五旅四六五團團長王同宇報吿吳部將於夜十二時叛變，將向商埠進攻。變起倉卒，上下震驚，可指揮之四個旅兵力，均尙在外國與匪對戰，吳師三個旅尚元整無缺，依當時狀况，危急萬分。原計劃向南北分路突圍，旋以在匪及吳逆重重包圍及東正面尙與匪黏着激戰中，不易拉開戰塲。但計劃行動之初，牟中珩及廖蔚文處長（第三處）等巳向北突圍成功。外傳種種，全係道聽途說。最後，司令部與各師旅長商討，下決心以主力守備城垣以一部守備南郊四里山千佛山及商埠有立醫院，打包廠，綏區司令部所在地之郵政大樓，及前德國領事館，火車站等要點時，吳逆化文所部已有團餘潛入市區西部，王舍人莊仍由歷城縣隊固守。城垣守備原由張景月負責，至此已無任務。</p>
<p>城區戰鬥過程</p>
<p>其次述城區戰鬥經過情形：廿日整日戰事沉寂，入晚吳化文部讓開正面匪軍進入市區向我市區各據點進犯經守軍奮勇抵抗均未得逞尤以省立醫院爭奪最爲慘烈城區方面匪向東外城永固門附近進犯，數次爬城，均經殲滅擊退。三個保安旅在普利門，捍石槁，永固門，齊魯大學之防守戰俱極英勇。</p>
<p>廿一日匪續向商埠各要點進犯省立聲院守軍二一一旅王不卿團經二畫夜激戰，全團壯烈犧牲。大車站及郵政大樓爭奪極爲慘烈，進犯火車站之匪被我馬培基旅機滅一個團，城區方而匪對東城攻擊最烈，夜半頭一部由永固門突入。</p>
<p>廿二日商埠火車站，郵政大樓，前德國領事館諸據點，守軍以傷亡過大，均向西向北突圍，爾後連絡中斷。城區方面突入永固門之匪，續增加，向內城攻擊，捍石橋方面之匪亦大舉猛攻，數次爬城，均經殲滅擊退，嗣以守軍傷亡過大，被匪突入，遂屋爭奪，極爲慘烈，乃逐次幢移內城最後核心陣地固守。</p>
<p>二十三日午後六時，匪以大口徑砲百餘門，集中向內城轟擊，圖先破壞我指揮中樞，一時彈如雨下，火光敞天，滿城一片火海，砲擊萬餘發，城中無處不落彈。尤以司令部所在地之省府及老省府皇亭，落彈最多，其砲火之猛烈，爲抗戰及勦匪各戰役所未見。此時省府後一水泥大掩體爲穿甲彈擊中，省府人員犧牲甚夥。特務團在一小時間犧牲於砲彈下者亦五六十人。我砲兵陣地移入省府，老省府，皇亭三處，守關之戰防砲等俱發射過度而炸裂。此時空軍偵察僅見一片火光，可見砲火之烈。通信運絡完全中斷，卽埋入地內之電綫亦均轟斷。匪繼以步兵大舉向城東南西三面猛攻爬城，時司令官及各師旅長均親臨城邊督戰，士氣極爲旺盛，東南角匪突入五次，均被殲滅，西南角擊退匪十一次攻勢。二十四日拂曉，經以城東南角新東門及氣象台方面城垣被匪砲兵擊毀缺口三處，守軍以傷亡過大，匪由各缺口突入，城內發生猛烈巷戰，十時匪近至皇亭時，司令官率指揮所人員在北極閣附近被大明湖阻斷，且守軍兵力巳傷亡殆盡，至此已無法挽回危局乃被迫率特務團餘部及十五旅王敬箴一部向北突圍，以後情况不明。城內之匪續向西迫，逐屋爭奪，於下午四時攻入省府，時省府以西及城西北角仍由我七七旅錢伯英旅餘部據守，廿五日拂曉，匪再大舉進攻，守軍堅强，誓死抵抗，激戰至午后五時，守軍全部壯烈犧牲，城區戰鬥，吿一段落。但入夜後，仍有零星戰鬥，稀疏槍聲，時南郊千佛山四里山仍在我手，王舍人莊守軍向南突圍。廿六日拂曉，匪向南郊千佛山四里山攻擊，激戰竟日，守軍二一三旅胡景瑗一團及十五旅王敬箴旅一營，均向南突圍，於是濟南守備戰吿終。北極閣司令官指揮所無綫電，對外聯絡，於廿四日上午十時中斷，省府司令部羅參謀長處無綫電，對外聯絡，於同日下午四時中斷。</p>
<p>濟市棄守原因</p>
<p>濟南守備戰由九月十四日序戰開始，至二十六日南郊山地陷匪，計血戰十二畫夜，計斃傷匪六萬餘，我亦傷亡四萬餘人，尤以最後城區戰鬥，在極困難狀况下，國軍將士用命，士氣旺盛，咸具與城共存亡之決心，極爲忠勇壯烈。如吳逆化文不中途叛變，濟南決可確保無虞。</p>
<p>濟南棄守原因，首爲吳化文叛變至十九日，國軍六個旅已損失約二個旅，吳化文三個旅均尙完整，且國軍作戰計劃及濟南內部情形，吳部洞悉無遺。其次爲被迫退守城區，整個作戰計劃變更。原計劃以辛莊馬鞍山千佛山等地爲最後核心陳地，有三分之二糧彈屯積辛莊附近，吳逆以辛莊爲核心，變起倉卒，國軍迫不得已，臨　改變計劃，以城區爲核　。</p>
<p>第三爲城區房屋密集，街巷狹小，不利巷戰。同時，城外房屋過於接近城垣，且俱爲髙樓，去幾魯南會戰後，爲適應軍事需要，曾一度爲掃淸射界，計劃拆除一部房屋，旋爲地方士紳反對，未能澈底實施，至爲惋惜。」</p>

<p>— 本報記者叢永樞</p>
<p>〔本報南通十二日訊〕「缺貨」與「搶購」的浪潮，處着肅殺的秋風來襲擊蘇北，改幣後平靜的蘇北，物價重又掀起了波瀾。</p>
<p>出猪子的如臯鬧肉亂，產棉的南通喊收不到棉花。日用品，綢絨百貨因爲是「外來品」，更是「缺貨」。</p>
<p>物資東流</p>
<p>就南通來說罷，限價的僅是城區較嚴，通東一帶各種物品普遍都超過了城區，以致釀成物資東流的現象。臨時也便有人轉業去當「黃牛黨」。據說，如果從城裏搶購到一小包洋紗，運到東鄕三五十里路的地帶去，至少可以謙到金圓五元。</p>
<p>市鎭上，買米也爲難。本來是好米的限價現在已由劣米來接替，要買就是這帶有霍味，摻有砂子的東西。買布也費事，布店櫉窗裏的布疋已稀鬆得多，要揀揀質地或花樣，站櫃台的先生會說：好的已經賣掉，無法補進，就只有這幾種了。肉也沒有，跨進十月以來，就沒有限價肉賣過，平價供應的軍肉也已十天沒有供應了。只有菜館和嗜肉如命的「吃客」才派人去鑽黑市。魚岔裏老是空空如也，賣魚的老闆立在旁邊招乎熟識的主顧到家裏去揀，這是人情，價錢便不得不遵算。豆腐，茶乾沒有漲，也沒有黑市，可是體積却小了近三分之一，靑菜，蘿蔔，芋頭這是家常蔬菜，比起十天前，差不多漲了一倍。大家只怕買不到，也不問漲不漲了。</p>
<p>缺貨原因</p>
<p>推究「缺貨」的原因，大概可分兩方面。一面是受了他地「禁止出口」和本地「限價」的影饗。旁的地方禁止出口，商品來源困窘，自然形成缺貨現象，而限價以後，外埠商人多在計算運向某一個地方可以多謙多少錢，而把物資避免運向這邊來。而更重要的，蘇北比江南更接近匪區，匪軍在這裏展開了破壞經濟管制。現在正是秋收登塲的時期，蘇北的原野上有金黃的穀子，有銀白的棉花，有大豆，有雜糧。可是就在蘇北原野上的城市裏，却鬧着糧荒，棉荒。鄕區的散匪騷動着掩護「秋徵」工作。政府區各樣物品都有限價，他們便放價搶購，奸商是只認瞰錢的，只要有錢謙，謙得多，什麼都不顧，什麼都做得來，把商品從限價裏抽出來，去套取更多的非法利閏。</p>
<p>品質日差</p>
<p>花　　　布，是南通農業，工業，手工業結成的一個經濟環，是南通經濟上的一個特點。</p>
<p>南通附近是產棉區，每年這時正是「花湧如雲」（棉號常貼的橫條）的時期。可是今年却不然了。一方面棉花限價，棉農不要錢用，不願把花脫手。另一方面，大部棉田在匪區，棉花運不出來。在這種來源稀少的情形下，小廠商便搶購，秤上一百斤皮花，算一百十五斤到一百二十斤的價錢，卽是提高棉價百分之十五到二十，這種做黑市的方式，名之曰「放秤」或「拔秤」，因爲搶購的緣因，摻雜的，摻水的也都不揀，只要是花，便收買，以致棉價日高，而品質日差。</p>

<h3 id="c110">同業展開採購工作以後　米市場到貨漸增　各地壓抑購米斤量米商頗感困難 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米在同業展開採購工作以來，到貨漸增，昨向南市塲報到者有行方一五一石，米號菜三八七石七斗，向北市塲報到貨者有行方七二三石，米號一七四石，米廠三七三石七斗，合計到貨一千七百九石四斗，內除米號及米廠爲供應其自設門市外。行方至貨均在市上開售，佛山市均按限價。</p>
<p>雜糧交易清淡，僅有零星售開，歸陽黑豆價二十開數十，黑芝門開十三包，價二十八元。開封提莊生仁交十二包，價三十二元七角，其他一律未開出。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據米業中某領袖人士談：本市米商承辦本市食米廿萬担後，刻正分頭向各產區收購，遠則江西·安徽·金壇一帶，佔量較多，近則松江·靑浦·蘇州·無錫·常然一帶，數量較少。惟各地運米來滬，常遭地方當局扣留，致對運滬日期，不無延擱。近日經督導員辦公處分別去電交涉，情形較好轉。第一批來自松江之米約一千餘担，經放行後，二三日內可到滬。惟渠等最惑困難者有二點：（一）向各地購米，常發生壓抑斤量之情事。例如蘇州照限價每一五四斤應爲十八元。近限價雖未動，惟斤量已自一五四斤壓抑至一四〇斤，以至最近之一三二斤。當熟亦然。每一五四斤限價十八元，近則僅壓剩一百十餘斤。直接影響辦米成本。（二）向各地採購之米，外表均極毛糙。將來運滬應售時，難免不發生若干誤會。職是之故，米商公會昨已去呈督導員辦公處·市府·社會局·特警處·經警大隊。五機構，請指示救濟辦法云。</p>

<p>關於複製業棉紗供應問題，該業公會理事長潘土浩曾一度與國行總裁俞鴻鈞商洽配紗事宜並提議公開統盤配給辦法，以維持該萊生產。聞潘氏是項提議，已獲得俞總裁同意，日內將由物資調節委會召開會議，討論此事。又據該菜負責人稱，目前該業所需廿支棉紗，滬地存量，計國行一萬餘件，紡調會三千件，美援紗四萬五千件，而該業每月實際需紗量卽須四萬件，故對今後供應問題，仍感困難。現該業所需棉紗，業經經管督導處核定爲三萬件，但迄未配給。</p>
<p>昨日紗布二市場，繼續停業。紡建公司循例開紗，計開出藍單二十支球鶴價七百元，係外埠紗商請購，白單六支副日光二百五十五元，十五支壽　年草包五百七十三元，卅二支雙股豐年大包八百八十元，四十二支雙股立馬筒線九百九十元，四十二支雙股二等簡線九百六十元，四十支三股寶光草包一千零三十元，計分十五支限被單業申購，卅二支限電模菜，二十一支限任購一種。</p>
<p>又訊，紡建公司十月份上半月外埠配紗，計無錫二十支九獅四十三件，武進三十件，又廿支彩魁星四十件，當熟廿支九獅卅三件，吳縣廿支彩魁屋九件，江陰廿支彩魁星十八件，又南匯廿五件，平湖六件，川沙九件，松江五件，新運會九件，共計二百廿七件，價均七百元，請購單須用藍單，紗款繳外灘中央銀行。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕據本市工商業鉅子談稱，目前自備外匯雖已開放，然對物資之格價方面，仍不能酌予調整。工商界所感到之困難仍多，由於國外貨價上升，工業原料進口成本甚高，多數用進口原料之製成品，無法依照限價出售。目前各工業工廠資本微薄，均不能直接蟄款向國外訂貨，進口商方而若無利益，則無意進口，故目前除希望開放自備外匯外，尙望當局將進口原料及製成品價格合理調整云。</p>

<p>浙江桐油產量，在全國雖非最多之一省，但經政府歷年努力提倡，至民國卅年統計，植桐面積已達六五六〇七畝，產地這四十餘縣，分佈於錢塘江上游，及甌江流城一帶。後以植桐地帶，皆屬山區，類均地瘠民貧，農民乃視植桐爲主要副業，新安江以北，分水，淳安，於潛三縣，三十年內均各產一萬五千祖左右，合計卽佔全省產量五分之一，實爲全省桐油生產最盛區域。此外如江山，壽昌，縉雲，建　，仙居等縣各產一萬担以上，遂昌，蘭谿，桐廬，麗水，常山，金華，永嘉，諸曁，宣平，泰順等縣各產五千担以上，均爲桐油生產主要之縣份。全省共計年產二十萬担左右，佔全國產額十分之一。</p>
<p>浙江所產桐油，戰前銷於省境內各縣者，佔四分之一。運銷外省與國外者，佔四分之三。運銷外地桐油之集中地點，爲杭州，永嘉，衢縣，蘭谿四處。每當迪產時期，均有油廠設莊坐辦，由衢縣，蘭谿運至杭州，或永嘉，再轉運出口。抗戰初期，以桐油爲主要軍需物資，浙省植桐事業，在政府努力倡道之下，蔚爲風氣。桐林面積，年有增加，據調查廿六年及廿九年三年之中，產量幾臻戰前一倍。而經由溫州，寗波兩地輪出之桐法，廿七年達一六五，一五七担，邪惡八年達二二一，六四五担，廿九年達一三〇，四〇三担，倘能順利推進，本省桐油之產量，不難超出一百萬担。無如時局改變，海口封鎖，陷區漸廣。民國卅年後，收購機關，又以運輸困難，未能盡量收購，遂至貨棄於地，乏人過問。嗣後糧價暴漲，工資轉高，桐農乃至伐桐樹，改植雜糧，於是桐油產量銳减。所幸卅一年問桐迪製化試驗成功，甌江兩岸煉油廠競相設立，以桐油提製汽油火油柴油，供應後方需求，乃能藉以挽回桐油頺勢不少。勝利以後，估計各縣桐油產量較戰前减低，至少百分之二五，量高百分之七五，平均統計爲百分之五〇，全省僅約年產八萬餘担。</p>

<h3 id="c143">低能的製造者 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>因爲自己忝居敎師之一緣故，在所謂「淸高」之中看到了若干不合理的事實，於是便有許多「一吐爲快」的感覺。</p>
<p>現在一般人都在說，抗戰以後，中學生的程度是大大地低落了，尤其是國·英·算。這是事實，但不能一定說是戰以後的事實。</p>
<p>因爲這是事實，所以在報章雜誌里，常常可以拜讀敎授們諷刺學生的打油詩，或是許多主考者的帶有輕蔑的歎息；這，在若干敎授們或主考者的眼光中，不免或隱或現地現出兩個不大體面的字：「低能」！</p>
<p>低能，難道我們價有這許多低能的靑年？戰爭能製造出這許多低能的靑年嗎？這不能不使人懷疑。因爲「天才」固難能可貴，「低能」也未見得觸目皆是。「天才」與「低能」，都該是絕少數中的絕少數的。</p>
<p>低能旣該和天才一般地爲數極少，但爲什麼現在又如此的普遍呢？以我的佔計，這現實的形成，不該歸咎於先大，却該歸咎於後天；一句話，是：人爲的摧殘。</p>
<p>要明暸這人爲的摧殘，該先正視今日我國的敎育制度。</p>
<p>我因爲敎國文的時間比較長一點，這里不妨談一談現在一般國文敎授的大概情形，雖說這只不過是一般認爲水準太低的三項科目中的一種。</p>
<p>在沒有說到正題以前，我得先吐出蘊藏在內心里頗久的一句話：現在中學校的科目，太多，太重，太複雜了。複雜繁重到不是一個中學生所能擔負的程度</p>
<p>在這種情形下，如果敎師們能設法儘量使自己所擔任的課程簡單，扼要而切實地使學生吸收消化，是還可補救多少的。但多數的敎師大都蕭規曹隨地依樣畫葫蘆，對於改革，不但不願，不屑，更不敢。</p>
<p>例如又說到國文吧，多數敎師們還緊抱科舉制度以文取士的殘骸，忘記了現在的學生不同於過去的士子。因而他們仍採取塡鴨式的方法，儘量把許多古舊陳死的詞句，向靑年的腦子里塞。這一塞，卽使是天才也要變成低能了。</p>
<p>論語·孟子甚至離騷·說文的亂敎，不必說了。卽使是國定國語吧，不是古今人文字都有嗎？然而敎師們似乎都有「言必稱堯舜」的習慣，大都是重古而輕今，薄白話而厚文言。情願敎一課抽象而空虛（至少，中學生該如此想）的「放鶴亭記」，却不情願說一說「九斤老太」，情願敎一課虛無縹渺（也是中學生的看法）的「滕王閣賦」，却不肯念一念情文俱茂的「背影」。肯呌學生自己去看一看或給他們說一個大概的，已是了不得了。</p>
<p>說到作文，學生是沒有說自己的話的機會的。題目總是「什麼什麼議」，「什麼什麼什麼試申述之」，「論什麼什麼」之類，使人懷疑到這或是唐和宋的時代。寫作則又必須文言，於是滿紙是「之乎者也」，開頭是「且夫」「嘗思」，又使人懷疑到這是滿淸學究的手筆。肯給學生說自己要說的話，寫自己看到或聽到的東西，可說簡直沒有。因而學生的作品，都是滿幅空言，一派廢話，聽不見現在的人的現在聲音。這豈不是存心要使學生成爲白痴。</p>
<p>此外，背文章，記典故，寫大小楷，這一類工作眞是不勝枚舉。但要記住，國文的時間，是每週六小時。如果學生是你自己，你受得了嗎？</p>
<p>如果我們認爲這制度是對的，便由他去。好在低能一多，個個都是低能，不低能的究是少數，要嘲笑，要諷刺，儘管嘲笑諷刺。否則便該改革消滅這製造低能的制度和人物！</p>
<p>我們不允許再有低能的製造者的存在！</p>

<h3 id="c145">從乘車受罪想起 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>乘電車，公共汽車，其擁擠之苦，等於受罪，此一事實，除了那些坐小汽車或專坐三輪車者以外，是沒有人不承認的了。但是，值得硏究的是：乘車的方式儘管是窮兇極惡，擠得乘客呌苦連天，怨聲載道，爲什麼還是滿車滿車的人要擠上去受刑呢？想一想，無罪是爲了生活。</p>
<p>生活上四大項目「衣食住行」，都與乘車一件事有密切的關係。乘車本就是「行」，而爲了滿足「衣·食·住」的需要，是不能坐在家裏等天上掉下麵包·衣服·房子來的，總還離不了到外面去參加工作，這就需要「行」了，於是就需要乘車。</p>
<p>人們爲了生活，就不能怕受罪，硬要熬忍下去。譬如我在未服務社會前，我乘車大體上是有個原則的，卽是當車內人太多時，決不上去。怎麼辦呢？或步行，或慢慢等。現在有職務在身就不行了，校課八點一刻開始，在這個時間以前就非趕到學校不可。假定在七點鐘就碰到一部車子，那便管不得擠不擠，受罪不受罪，只有請君入甕——上車。</p>
<p>所以，我的結論是：一般人爲了生活，故不怕受罪。</p>
<p>於是，我又想，旣然爲了生活而不怕受罪，無怪乎社會上犯罪的人有如此其多了。明知犯了法是要受刑罰的，但是爲了衣食問題，在「上天無路，入地無門」的情况下，便只有出於犯法妄爲之一途了。這是就窮苦人說。</p>
<p>再就生活不成問題的富貴人來說，他們爲什麼也要干犯法紀呢？我的想法是，推其原因：第一，「爲富不仁」，大概他們的富貴本是經過「不仁」的途徑而達成的，他們已經「不仁」慣了，怎麼會一下子「仁」得起來呢！第二，生活雖不成問題，但生活的享受是無底止的，富了想做官，做了官想做皇帝，做了皇帝想做神仙，爲了滿足更高級的享受，自然不惜違法亂紀了。第三，有錢有勢的，自然又怕什麼！總結三點來說，也無非爲了生活，但這生活是儘量圖享受罷了。</p>
<p>所以，這里的結論是：爲了生活，不惜犯法，不懼刑罰。</p>
<p>這樣說起來，是不是不怕坐軍受罪的人，也一定不怕犯法受罪呢？否，否，否！這里的關鍵主要在人格修養上。同樣是爲了生活，不怕受罪，但有人格修養者，只是不怕坐車而已；無人格修養者，豈僅不怕坐車而已，他是「坐牢」也不在乎的。</p>
<h3 id="c146">獸智 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 張詠江</p>
<p>老馬能識途，狡兎有三窟，獸類的智慧，有時的確是頗足驚人。從前美國有一個人，經過華盛頓州東部的一個荒寒的草原，走近一個井邊，險些兒墜下井去。那井原來是有人要想掘地取水而未曾掘得的乾井。他一時好奇心動，就俯身躺在地上，向井裏看去，只見裏邊黑漆漆地，大約有十五英尺深。離井口向下約二英尺的地方，有一條一英尺來往深的凹槽，凹入井壁裏，靠着井壁盤旋着，像槍管裏的來福綫一般的直向并底盤去。他驚奇的視綫跟着那凹槽向幽暗的井底看去，只見下面有一雙死狼僵仆在那裏。</p>
<p>這是怎樣的一回事，他看了起先全然不解。後來仔細揣測，就恍然大悟了。原來那螺旋形的凹槽，不是從上而掘下去，却是從下面掘上來的。那狼落到井裏去之後，跳又跳不出，覺得惟一的自救的方法，祇有靠井壁掘一條螺旋形的凹槽，從凹槽裏盤旋着爬上來。掘呀，奮鬥呀，努力呀，牠堅毅不拔的向上掘，向上掘。牠那成千累萬的足爪印顯示着牠許多小時或竟是許多日子的勞績。於是，剛巧牠卽將獲得自由了，但是，一個失足，却又了跌了下去。或許是因爲牠把自己的能力估計得太高，要想從地面下二英尺處的槽端跳上來，力有未逮，重復跌下，受傷過重而死的；或許是因爲餓得時間久了，力盡不能再掘，以致於死的；那可不得而知了。牠有幾乎和人類並駕的工程智識，牠那自救的計劃不過功虧一簣，牠的智慧也值得稱道了。</p>
<h3 id="c147">續論搶購 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>假如我是擁有多金的人，我必不搶購東西，因爲多金之後不會愁柴愁米，愁凍死餓死，而應該修我的精通四國文字，寫得一筆好字，做得一百首好詩的勝業去了。假如我兌了金鈔之後多出了一筆三百五百元錢來無甚用處（假如日常生活有職業維持），我也必不購穿了給人看看也並不好看的三等西裝，或寫起字來決不及周虎臣羊毫之有味，又要提心吊膽防扒手的五十一型派克，或呌太太去坐在理髮店裏上電刑。我只請一位月薪只要二十元的法文敎師，一次付他兩三年學費，讀我的第二外國文，或買一部二十四史，讀中華民族一個明白。這是說中國或上海只有我一個人有此「游資」。假如七海有千個萬個人有之，則事將更可做得利人利已一點。</p>
<p>假如我們的弄堂裏有十個人多出三五百以至一二百元錢，一時無用處而怕白放着如烟消如雲散，我們何妨拿出來把我們這個豪雨時水深沒膝，天晴時崎嶇難行的弄堂路修一修，請個人每天把地掃一掃？若還有得多，何妨再種點樹木花草？</p>
<p>假如我們這段路上有幾百個人多出三五百以至一二百元錢來，我們何妨且勿購不急甚至無用之物，而請一位鄰近的醫生經常爲我們撿騐身體，醫治疾病，行有餘力，則爲貧病者起死回生。何妨送點在本路小學校敎書的先生們柴米油鹽，請他們敎起書來精神大振，循循善誘？何妨購置點書籍，成立一個小岡書館？何妨裝隻公用電話大家用用？</p>
<p>假如我們這一區有千人萬人多三五百元錢無甚用處，何妨合起來辦個醫院，辦所學校，辦個托兒所，辦個難民習藝所？</p>
<p>如果我們不如此，袋裏多了點錢，只知搶購無用之物，放在家裏積灰塵餵老鼠飼蛀虫，好吧，總有一天引鬼上門，够你受的。「獨善其身」上面，你該知道是「窮則」二字吧！</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>擔買之風，各處流行，北平自亦不能例外，但有與他處不同，比較的緩和些。一個原因是這水土厚重，習慣悠閒的舊都，從來就有一種鎭靜從容的風度，講究「心急面不急」，縱然大變當前，用心思苦對付，亦不會像上海那樣浮動性之表現無餘。第二個原因：北平是文化區，不是通商碼頭，正常時期之熱鬧繁華，平不及津，津不及滬，則變態時期之擠擠搶搶，吵吵鬧鬧，忙忙亂亂，亦不致「萬蜂」，過於烏烟療氣。如本報前登黃牛黨露宿街頭的銅版，一排一排一條一條「沙丁魚」的景像，及佔地買「窩之奇計，天津已受傳染，北平還未學步，排隊挨站則是有的。現在平津亦傳說黃牛黨之名，約係沿自海派。向來北地有類此行爲，無此名詞。大凡遇著擠兌或搶買的事情發生，占號排隊者多非本主，自有些人各處承　，或到門口探問，或在行店門外逡巡，或以小資本用折扣收買配給票，或是窮人男婦領資代買來站隊，挨受風霜之苦，換取酬勞。（謂之「工夫錢」，以婦女爲多，因婦女易得「窗內櫃上人」之同情，比男性爲優先。）此種風氣，從民初銀行擠兌時卽已有之。</p>
<p>現在各街商店，凄寂蕭條，尤以油鹽糧米及日用品各舖爲甚。門口貼上「香油已賣完」，「大鹽已盡」，醬油料酒掛麵，凡廚下應用之物，不說不賣，亦不說缺貨，只說「賣完」。卽便一早趕去，他們又說：比你還早的搶買去了。其實早已移人別處，架上空空。北平商人略見搶買迹象，便經緊收藏，其眼明手快，先機應付，亦還是一切從容的「老北京」的慣技。熟人到櫃上買，亦是碰釘。（雖然熱人不至於作難，還怕官方便衣人看見不得了，故至熟之人，亦須夜間把貨送到府上，不以買賣方式而成交，「黑市」二字，做到十分。）所以日用品搶買之風，在極短的時間，已成過去，現在只是門市淸冷，架空人靜。掌櫃與舖夥，相對「參禪」。有問津的買主，則笑而搖頭。買者亦微笑報之，總是那麼懶洋洋，意謙謙的！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Another Great Victory on the Eastern Section of the Ping Sui Railway: Nie's Bandit Main Force Collapses Across the Board, Corpses Littered Between Juyongguan and Kangzhuang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 15th] The main force engaged in fierce combat on the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway, and the National Army has achieved a great victory. The North China剿匪 Headquarters announced: The National Army converged on Qinglongqiao from the north and south on the evening of the 14th and dispatched troops to guard Chadao, Sanbao, Xibozi, and other places. Nie Rongzhen's bandit Second Corps (including the Fourth Column, the Fourth Brigade of the Second Column, the Independent First and Seventh Brigades, and the New Seventh and New Eighth Divisions) threw all their strength into a fierce attack on the above areas. The battle was extremely fierce and fraught with danger. Every hilltop was subjected to a seesaw battle. The fighting continued until 2 p.m. on the 15th, when the bandits collapsed across the board and retreated northeastward. The Fourth Brigade of the Second Column was almost completely annihilated, and other bandit units also suffered extremely heavy casualties in this three-day and three-night battle. The National Army is currently continuing its pursuit.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Fu Zuoyi Enthusiastically Discusses the Victory <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] After Fu Zong司令 Fu Zuoyi invited reporters from Beiping to Xishan for an autumn outing at the Political Work Department of the 剿匪 Headquarters, he specially hosted a dinner at the headquarters in the western suburbs and announced the news of the National Army's victory on the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway. Describing the war situation, he said: "There is a very good news, which is the capture and annihilation of the bandit Second Corps with a devastating blow. For several months, the Communist bandits have tried their best to avoid a decisive battle with the main force of the National Army, taking advantage of gaps and harassing everywhere, attempting to achieve their dream of 'the big eating the small.' Therefore, although the National Army has been constantly fighting for several months, it has not been able to capture the main force of the bandits and completely annihilate them. Recently, amid the Communist bandits' so-called 'autumn offensive' clamor, a unit of the North China National Army was transferred to Huludao. At the same time, because Nie Rongzhen's Third Corps and the Red Army of the original Jin Sui Military Region and North Yue Military Region, Yao Zhe, Kang Jianmin, Huang Liqing, Yang Jiarui, etc., and the newly编 Eighth Column colluded and harassed Chahar and Suiyuan, most of the National Army was transferred west. It was at this time that we deliberately exposed a large gap in the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway. This gap is the throat of transportation between Tianjin and Chahar and Suiyuan and the most dangerous and crucial section of the Pingzhang Railway protecting Beiping, the Guangou section from Juyongguan in the south to Kangzhuang in the north, luring the Communist bandits to take the bait. For this purpose, the National Army withdrew from several county strongholds, and local teams and security forces suffered losses of eight or nine hundred to over a thousand."</p>
<p>"As everyone knows, the terrain in this area is the most dangerous, and the situation is also the most important in military history. The National Army left very little force, and it is mountainous terrain. The Communist bandits have always believed that the mountains belong to them, and the National Army is not accustomed to mountain warfare and needs to fight at night. The Communist bandits believe that night also belongs to them, and the National Army is not good at night warfare. In this area, supplies are extremely inconvenient, and the air force cannot easily scout and assist in the battle. Therefore, the Communist bandits believed that all conditions were favorable to them and unfavorable to the National Army. Thinking this was an excellent opportunity, they sent Nie Rongzhen's main Second Corps, the Second, Third, and Fourth Columns, and the Independent First and Seventh Brigades, as well as the New Seventh and New Eighth Divisions under Zhan Danan, who belonged to the Jicha Rebian District, to take the bait, and they advanced into this area with all their might and occupied the most dangerous commanding heights, Badaling, and the surrounding mountains. When the war progressed to the most tense and highest point, those of us who did not know military matters felt very worried and apprehensive when we heard the news. Of course, we could not lure the bandits if we did not do this, but if we did not use it properly, the future would be unimaginable. Fortunately, a certain military commander personally directed the advance from Nankou to the north, and another military commander acted with great speed and advanced from Kangzhuang to the south. The National Army adapted to the situation, especially our air force comrades, who dispatched day and night to assist in the battle, completing tasks that ordinary people could not complete. The officers and soldiers gave their lives, and their comrades-in-arms were brave and endured hardships. After three days and three nights of seesaw battles, as of 2 p.m. today, the bandits were completely defeated, and the bandit Fourth Brigade and bandits in several areas were completely annihilated, with no one escaping. The bandits' abandoned corpses were scattered throughout the mountains and valleys, and guns and ammunition were abandoned everywhere. A unit of the National Army is currently cleaning up the battlefield, dispatching trucks to transport prisoners, and checking the results of the battle. The main force of the National Army is fiercely and thoroughly pursuing the bandits in the northeast direction. This battle can be said to be the most thrilling and difficult victory, and also the most enjoyable in recent months. I think the bandit army may also know that mountain warfare and night warfare do not belong to them. On the contrary, mountains and nights belong to the National Army."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The National Army's powerful corps are advancing with all speed from the east and west to Jinzhou, the center of the Western Liaoning battlefield. Good news is constantly coming. The West Route National Army, which recaptured Tashan, reached Gaoqiao Station on the 15th and launched an encirclement and suppression of the bandit forces there. The East Route National Army recovered He'an on the morning of the 15th and is currently advancing westward.

Another National Army unit advancing on the west bank of the Raoyang River also recaptured Damintun (28 li east of Xinlitun), Guishanbao, and Guojiatun (25 kilometers northeast of Xinlitun), completely defeating the three divisions belonging to the Fifth and Tenth Columns of the bandits. In the past two days, more than 3,500 bandits have been killed. The National Army has now advanced to the vicinity of Xinlitun and is continuing its pursuit.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 15th] On the 15th, fires raged in the central urban area of Jinzhou, and battles continued near major strongholds. The old city remained standing, and the National Army held firm. This was the report from aerial reconnaissance in the morning. According to news obtained here, bandits infiltrated the city from the southeast and northwest of the urban area, and street fighting became increasingly fierce, especially in the area south of the railway station and the garrison headquarters. The provincial government on the highlands northwest of the urban area, the railway station in the center of the city, the railway bureau in the eastern part of the city, the Quartermaster General's Office, and the university preparatory class all still saw action on the afternoon of the 15th, proving that the defending army was still fighting bravely. At dawn on the 15th, the aircraft saw both sides engaged in fierce artillery battles. The air force carried out heavy bombing of the bandits' rear units. The bandits used 100,000 troops to attack Jinzhou. A large number were killed or wounded by bombs. Amid the dim twilight of the 15th, the air force made efforts to contact the ground by using the ground fire. The battle in Jinzhou may be slightly intermittent, and the reinforcements from Huludao continue to press toward Gaoqiao. A certain high official here once flew to give instructions. Also, there are signs that bandits in Jinzhou are drawing troops to attack Jinxi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] On the 15th, our aircraft groups flew in batches to the periphery of Jinzhou to carry out effective bombing of the bandits. The positions 3 kilometers east, west, and northeast of Jinzhou, half a li southeast of the city, and southeast of Beidaying were heavily bombed by our planes, destroying more than a dozen bandit fortifications, and the city defense tended to stabilize. Many bandits were ambushed in the positions on the south side of the river bay east of the railway 3 kilometers east of Tashan. Our planes carried out intensive strafing, killing many bandits. After the bandit positions on the riverside of Liujiatun south of Jinzhou were discovered, 40 bandits were killed.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 15th] For five months, the military and civilians defending the city of Changchun have been supporting themselves through extreme material shortages, and their mental distress is indescribable. Since the interruption of transportation, letters cannot be sent out to this day, and even telegrams cannot be used to communicate with relatives and friends inside the Pass due to the failure of the telecommunications bureau's generator.

Although large amounts of idle capital can no longer enter the Pass, public officials and soldiers who have families inside the Pass cannot remit money to support them, and they all hope that this can be resolved quickly.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 15th] The 11th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 15th. President Sun presided over the meeting. First, five reporting items were passed. The Executive Yuan's request for review of the draft provisional regulations on the monthly salary and public expenses for presidents, vice presidents, appointed, and specially appointed personnel of the Examination Yuan was referred to the Legal System and Budget Committees for joint review in accordance with the opinions of the Procedure Committee. Then, temporary motions were processed. (1) Zhao Hui et al. proposed that the report that the next year's central government general budget would be sent to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan before the end of November is too inconsistent with the Constitution and the Budget Law and affects the progress of the review work. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to send the budget to the Legislative Yuan for review before the end of October as much as possible. The resolution was to send another letter to the Executive Yuan to inquire and ask them to send the draft budget for the next year for review as soon as possible. (2) Zhang Zhijiang et al. proposed that since the currency system reform, prices have risen sharply again recently, and black markets are lurking, resulting in a bad market situation. It is proposed to quickly hold a secret meeting to review prices, thoroughly study methods, so as to stabilize people's livelihood and consolidate the foundation of the country. The resolution was passed, and it was decided to hold a secret meeting on the 18th to review the price issue, and to invite the heads of the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries to attend and report for questioning. (3) Li Feng et al. proposed to request the government to increase the allocation of flour in the three cities of Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, increasing the allocation by 30 jin per person per month, and to open up the north-south grain transport. (4) Li Yaolin et al. proposed to request the Executive Yuan to amend the current method of grain allocation in the five major cities. These two temporary motions are of the same nature as the formal proposal of Li Yu et al., which is listed as a matter for discussion, to propose to improve the urban grain allocation as soon as possible in order to save public funds and maintain the national treasury. Li Yaolin's temporary motion advocated investigating the population, eliminating the fictitious, stopping the allocation of grain to pawnshops and large households, and encouraging grain merchants to purchase, transport, and sell grain in domestic and foreign production areas to regulate surpluses and deficits, which is in line with the measures in Li Yu's case. However, Li Yu and Li Yaolin's two temporary motions advocated increasing the amount of flour allocation in the three cities of Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, which conflicted with the principle of universally reducing the amount of allocation per month in Li Yu's case. After a joint discussion, it was decided to submit it to the Grain Administration Committee for joint review. Then, the discussion items listed on the agenda were started. The first case was proposed by Wu Gan et al., the Act on Promoting Economic Rationalization. After the staff of the Secretariat read the full text of the proposal, the meeting was adjourned as time had run out. The meeting continued at 3:40 p.m. for discussion. More than a dozen committee members put forward oral and written opinions. The members generally agreed with the principles of the case, but put forward amendments to certain clauses and details. Finally, it was passed without objection, and the case was submitted to the Finance and Economics, Economy and Resources, Grain Administration, Land Administration, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, Social, and Legal System committees for joint review. The second case was the report of the Procedure Committee on the reorganization of Jin Shaoxian et al.'s proposal to clarify the administrative situation of the Executive Yuan and its ministries and committees as a basis for the decisions of the Legislative Yuan. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan and to order the ministries and committees to submit periodic reports on the administrative situation to the Legislative Yuan during this session in order to conform to the spirit of the Constitution. After Cheng Tianfang, a member of the Procedure Committee, explained it, the "Measures of the Legislative Yuan for Periodically Hearing the Executive Yuan's Administrative Reports and Questioning" were discussed. However, it was already past 6 p.m. after it had just begun, and most committee members advocated postponing the discussion to the next meeting, so the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Ensuring a Sound Organization for Issuance Reserve Supervision and Administration; Enhancing People's Confidence in the Gold Yuan; Control Yuan's Finance and Food Committee Submits Another Corrective Proposal Regarding Candidates for the Supervisory Committee <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Control Yuan believes that the candidates for the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee do not adequately represent the people of the entire nation. Previously, the Finance and Food Committee of the Yuan submitted a corrective proposal, which was forwarded to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has already responded, but the Finance and Food Committee believes that the Executive Yuan's response does not align with the intent of the corrective proposal. It decided to submit another corrective proposal during a meeting held on the 15th. It is reported that the Executive Yuan's response stated, "The sole task of the Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee is to inspect, safeguard, and announce the issuance reserves to demonstrate trustworthiness. Moreover, inspection, safeguarding, and other matters largely involve specialized techniques. It seems more reasonable to select committee members who are familiar with or close to financial and accounting operations. The committee members are all chairmen of national commercial banking and accounting organizations, which aligns with your Yuan's views." The Control Yuan's Finance and Food Committee's second corrective proposal states: "The amount of Gold Yuan issued and whether the reserves are sufficient are deeply related to the national finances and the interests of the people. China has a vast territory. To ensure that the people of the entire nation can understand the actual situation of the new currency issuance and reserves, and to further strengthen their confidence in the new currency, the candidates for the Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee should be selected with attention to including those who represent the majority of people from various regions and groups across the country to demonstrate trustworthiness. Article 10 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations does not stipulate that committee members must be government agencies and financial representatives. The Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee Organizational Regulations established by the Executive Yuan are unilateral decrees of the Executive Yuan, which have not undergone legislative procedures and are not laws. They can be amended at its discretion in consideration of legal principles and factual circumstances. The inspection and safekeeping matters mostly involve specialized techniques, and Article 3 of the Organizational Regulations has already stipulated the establishment of four to eight auditors to handle review, accounting, and report preparation matters. Item 6 stipulates that staff are all seconded from the Ministry of Finance, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the Central Bank. Technical matters are already the responsibility of dedicated personnel, so this cannot be used as a reason. Furthermore, the originally appointed committee members, in terms of region, are only from Shanghai; in terms of the professional organizations represented, only commercial banking and accounting organizations are represented. Not a single person from farmers' associations and labor unions, which constitute the vast majority of the national population, has been selected. To say that this can represent the whole country is a distortion. Therefore, to improve the supervisory organization and enhance the people's confidence, another corrective proposal is submitted, requesting prompt and reasonable improvements to demonstrate trustworthiness."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Control Yuan's Finance and Food Committee passed the proposal of the Fujian-Taiwan District Supervisory Committee Office on the 15th and submitted a corrective proposal regarding the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, a state-run enterprise, for excessively occupying land, oppressing the people, and having a large organization that wastes national funds.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Control Yuan's investigation of salt administration has recently come to an end. Control Yuan members Zhang Dinghua, Wang Xiangchen, and Liu Xingzhi have conducted separate on-the-ground investigations for more than a month and have separately drafted corrective and impeachment proposals regarding matters that should be promoted and reformed in salt administration, and submitted them to the Control Yuan. On the afternoon of the 15th, the Yuan's Finance and Food Committee passed two corrective proposals jointly submitted by members Zhang Dinghua and Wang Xiangchen: (1) a corrective proposal regarding the accumulated malpractices in salt administration, and (2) a corrective proposal regarding the Salt Administration Bureau's handling of employee welfare programs. The full text of both formal proposals will be released by the Control Yuan within days. It is reported that the main points of the salt administration malpractice case are: 1. There are two illegal surcharges in addition to the regular tax: (1) the business transportation salt tax protection fee, and (2) the recorded tax, the commercial salt tax loss reserve fund. 2. The turnover of annual salt is inappropriate. 3. Amortization and depreciation are illegal. 4. Auditing and accounting fees are ineffective in salt administration agencies. 5. There are easy opportunities for corruption in transportation and pricing. 6. Administrative expenses are excessive.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Can the United Nations Solve the Berlin Problem? <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The United Nations Security Council, in order to break the deadlock, moved the Berlin problem to behind-the-scenes negotiations and adjourned for a week. It resumed debate on the Berlin problem on the 15th. During the week-long adjournment, representatives of the six neutral countries made great efforts to mediate, hoping to resolve the Berlin crisis peacefully; however, the result was not only a failure to break the deadlock of the Berlin event, but also a hardening of attitudes on both sides. The Western allies insisted on the principle of lifting the blockade before negotiations, while the Soviet Union demanded that the Berlin problem be removed from the Security Council's agenda before negotiations to resolve the Berlin crisis. With neither side willing to yield, the matter could only be settled in the Security Council. Representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held a meeting on the 14th to discuss the resolution to be submitted to the Security Council, seemingly to compel the Security Council to take action within a few days. Even if the Soviet Union does not withdraw from the United Nations, it will undoubtedly exercise its veto power in the Security Council, preventing the Security Council from passing any resolution. Therefore, whether the Security Council can solve this thorny problem has become the focus of world attention at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris.</p>
<p>Since October 4, the Security Council has been dealing with the complaint of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. The world is worried about whether the United Nations can pass this serious test. Initially, Soviet representative Vyshinsky opposed placing the Berlin issue on the Security Council's agenda on the grounds that "the United Nations' discussion of the Berlin event violates the Potsdam Agreement." Later, the Security Council disregarded the Soviet representative's opposition and passed the motion to place the Berlin event on the agenda. The Soviet representative then announced that it would never participate in this discussion, and the Ukrainian representative also stated that it would stand with the Soviet representative, leaving the Security Council in a difficult predicament. However, for the sake of breaking the deadlock on the Berlin problem, and also for the sake of the future of the United Nations, the six neutral countries in the Security Council unanimously advocated that the Security Council temporarily adjourn and move the Berlin problem to behind-the-scenes discussions, so that representatives of the neutral countries could contact each other outside the meeting to find a compromise solution, so as to peacefully resolve the Berlin problem and also spare the Security Council this serious test. Therefore, during the seven days of the Security Council's adjournment, the hope of compromise was never extinguished, and the call for resuming peace talks was loud. The neutral countries suggested "lifting the blockade of Berlin on the one hand and conducting negotiations between the four powers on the other," which was likely to be accepted by both sides. However, after the four powers' diplomats circled around Paris several times, all hopes returned to disillusionment. When U.S. Secretary of State Marshall returned to the United States to report on his duties and returned to Paris, the Western allies decided to abandon their attempts to compromise with the Soviet Union and compel the Security Council to take action on the Berlin issue, forcing representatives of the six neutral countries to abandon their plans to mediate the Berlin problem. The Security Council resumed its meeting on the 15th and naturally had to deal with this most thorny issue according to its scheduled agenda.</p>
<p>According to the speculation of well-informed diplomatic sources, the Western countries and the Soviet Union will take the following three steps in a showdown: (1) In the Security Council, they will accuse the Soviet Union of blockading Berlin, which is enough to threaten world peace. Although they know that the Soviet representative will exercise his veto power, they will still force the Security Council to express itself. (2) In the United Nations General Assembly, the British representative will be the first to speak, condemning the Soviet Union for plunging the post-war world into a state of turmoil, and pointing out that the Soviet Union's proposal for world disarmament and a one-third reduction in each country's military is also insincere. (3) In the United Nations General Assembly, with the support of an overwhelming majority, the atomic energy control plan proposed by the United States will be passed, and the Soviet Union will be declared the only obstacle to the establishment of an atomic energy control system. If things really develop like this, it will inevitably lead to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the United Nations, which will still have no practical effect on the resolution of the Berlin problem, and will only create a breakdown of the United Nations organization. This really makes us feel infinitely anxious about the future of the United Nations!</p>
<p>Purely from a legal point of view, it is not objectionable for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to appeal to the Security Council on the Berlin issue, mainly to test the actual effectiveness of the United Nations organization. However, according to the characteristics of the United Nations organization, its foundation is entirely built on international solidarity and cooperation. Problems can only be resolved peacefully under the premise that the great powers have the same opinions. Otherwise, if the great powers have different opinions, as long as one country expresses disagreement, whether it exercises its veto power or withdraws from the United Nations organization, it can promote the disintegration of the United Nations organization and further demonstrate the division of the world. Therefore, all those who truly love the United Nations do not agree to handing over any disputes between the great powers to the United Nations for handling. Even with regard to the Berlin problem, under the circumstances that the Eastern and Western blocs are moving towards extremes, no matter what action the Security Council takes, it will not be able to resolve the Berlin crisis, but will cause difficulties for the United Nations, and its weaknesses will be exposed without a doubt, merely shattering humanity's only hope for world peace. How unwise is this!</p>
<p>In today's world where people yearn for peace, everyone must be patient, seek understanding from mutual recognition, and seek common ground in understanding. This is the true way to love the United Nations. Otherwise, if each goes to extremes and is willing to embark on the road of division, the United Nations will also lose its meaning of representing the whole world and will encounter the same fate as the old League of Nations.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] According to the Grain News Agency: Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, in view of the fact that the local governments in most grain-producing areas have independently promulgated laws and regulations prohibiting the export of grain, which has greatly affected the central government's unified planning for military supplies and civilian grain, specially issued an order on the 15th to the heads of all provinces and cities, instructing them to promptly order their jurisdictions to strictly prohibit the obstruction of grain transportation and the interception and purchase of grain along the way. If local governments have already engaged in similar bad behavior, they should be strictly cracked down on in order to facilitate the implementation of grain administration. The order also reiterated the previous order to thoroughly implement the "Grain Circulation Management Regulations."</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 15th] Chairman Song of the Provincial Government, in order to purchase grain for famine relief, previously sent Commissioner Zhan Chaoyang to Siam to negotiate the purchase of Siamese rice.

The provincial government has approved this, and the purchase and transportation matters are under negotiation. In the future, the late rice harvest will be available, and foreign rice can also be transported in time, so the food situation in Chaoshan is expected to be worry-free.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Information from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: The French Economic Delegation in China previously sent a letter suggesting Sino-French barter trade. The scope of goods listed was very broad, and the total amount of barter trade was worth USD 27.6 million. After consultation with relevant units such as the Export Control Commission, the China Trust Bureau, the Qi Commission, and International Trade, the following two principles were formulated: (1) For commodities that can be exchanged for foreign exchange, the method of selling for cash should be adopted as much as possible to promote sales abroad. If sales are difficult or sales prices are excessively loss-making, the method of barter trade will be adopted after considering the situation. (2) For materials exchanged through barter trade, selections will be made according to domestic needs and in consideration of international market prices. The Export Control Commission will invite representatives from the Central Bank, the Trust Bureau, and the French side to consult and determine the following barter trade principles: (1) The transaction amount is set at USD 500,000. (2) The barter trade term is temporarily set at half a year. (3) The types of barter trade are temporarily set as cigarette paper (worth approximately USD 200,000) and pigments or caustic soda (worth approximately USD 300,000) for import, and green tea or other export materials for export. (4) The detailed measures will be negotiated by the China Trust Bureau and the French representatives. It is heard that the French government may agree to these principles, and the relevant authorities in our country have prepared documents to submit to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the China Trust Bureau will negotiate a contract with the delegation.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 15th] The Guangzhou Economic Supervision Office held an emergency meeting to discuss issues such as preventing the black market and supplying materials in response to recent drastic market fluctuations. The meeting resolved to punish all those disrupting the financial market with the death penalty and to increase the quantity of rice rations sold. In addition, the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a limited-price symposium yesterday due to price fluctuations and the major impact on business. The meeting resolved to appeal to the government to allocate as much material as possible, allow the circulation of materials, not prohibit exports, allow purchases from other places, and advocate restricting the private transportation of daily necessities to Hong Kong and Macau. It is also learned that after the Guangdong authorities promulgated the measures to limit the amount of cash carried south, a large amount of speculative capital still flowed south from Hunan and Hubei to purchase materials to be transported north. In order to prevent this, a train inspection team will be organized on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to conduct strict searches.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The persons in charge of the three major public utilities in Guangzhou, tap water, electricity, and telephone, jointly called on Mayor Ouyang to complain about the shortage of funds for public utilities and the difficulty in maintaining them, and asked for permission to resign. Mayor Ouyang comforted them and promised to find ways to improve the current situation. He immediately met with Huo Baoshu, the assistant supervisor of the Economic Supervision Office, to discuss a temporary loan of 5 million Gold Yuan. Huo agreed to request instructions from the central government to resolve the matter.</p>

<p>[Our Ningbo Office, 15th] Amidst the restrictions on the export of rice, an incident of grain merchants colluding with grain officials to forge documents to transport rice out of the territory occurred in this port. Chen Yunshui, a grain merchant from Yuyao, held a transportation certificate issued by the local Land and Grain Office, stating that the amount was 200 shi, requesting the Sixth Branch of the Yin Police Bureau to release it. The police saw that his actions were suspicious and immediately telegraphed the Land and Grain Office to inquire. They claimed that the transportation certificate was only issued up to No. 324, but the one held by the merchant was No. 329, which was obviously a fraud. They asked Director Fu to detain him. After a rigorous interrogation, they learned that it was handled by Zhang Hanfu, a staff member who had left his job, and Zhang obtained it from Shen Yannian, a staff member of the Land and Grain Office in charge of Civil Mediation Committee affairs. The police bureau immediately summoned them to their addresses, but both of them had already absconded. They are now under strict investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Office, 15th] After the negotiated prices of rice, food, and oil were raised here, the phenomenon of commodity shortages has not diminished. Citizens are waiting at rice stores, and even one sheng or one liang is difficult to buy. The provincial and municipal authorities are very anxious and have convened discussions with various parties for days, deciding to implement comprehensive economic controls and take three major steps: dredging sources, limiting consumption, and rationally adjusting prices. They have also discussed a method of exchanging goods between urban and rural areas and plan to submit it to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters to set up a management and guidance organization to strengthen control functions.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Establishment of the Anthracite Regulation Committee: Responsible for Coal Pricing and Allocation, While Supply and Sales are Handled by Individual Mines <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Anthracite Regulation Committee held its inaugural meeting at 10:00 AM on the 15th at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian presided over the meeting. Attendees included Sun Yueqi, Chairman of the National Resources Commission; Zhang Zizhu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce; Cai Wenzhao, Director of the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense; Zhao Chuanyun, Assistant Director of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications; and Chen Shuzeng, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. Sun Yueqi was immediately elected as Chairman and Zhang Zizhu as Vice Chairman. The committee was jointly established by the aforementioned relevant agencies in accordance with the spirit of the Legislative Yuan's resolution and the measures agreed upon by the Executive Yuan. Its responsibilities include: (1) price verification, (2) allocation, (3) maintaining safe coal reserves, and (4) allocating and selling coal to public servants and educators. Its nature is purely a design, policy-making, supervision, and coordination body. Coal supply and sales operations are entirely the responsibility of the mine operators themselves. Therefore, it is distinctly different from the previous Coal Management Committee and the Anthracite Supply and Distribution Office. Its organization is also highly streamlined. The committee internally is divided into only two groups: General Affairs and Investigation, with a total staff of only 20 people, primarily on temporary assignment. Staff from the former Coal Management Committee and Coal Supply Office will be dismissed entirely. The committee is scheduled to hold its second meeting on the 18th of this month to actively plan for implementation. At a time when the emergency decree on financial and economic measures is being strengthened, anthracite coal is impacted by industrial costs and land and water transport prices. Its availability or scarcity is closely related to public utilities, railway transport, and industrial production. With the approaching winter season, there is concern about coal shortages. It is impossible to allow freedom and especially important to make timely plans and full preparations to assist in suppressing the rebellion and stabilizing the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Regarding the future anthracite coal supply, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the National Resources Commission convened a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, inviting responsible individuals from Kailuan, Huadong, Huainan, and Taiwan mines to discuss the issue. The meeting was presided over by Chen Qitian. After an exchange of views, the following points were decided: (1) The Anthracite Regulation Committee is responsible for coal pricing and allocation, while coal supply and sales are the responsibility of the individual mines themselves. (2) Each mine should establish a joint supply office or acting sales office for supplying anthracite coal, to be established by the 25th. (3) The supply of anthracite coal to the public by each mine will commence on November 1st. The existing agencies will remain responsible for maintaining operations during the current month. (4) The measures for each mine's supply of anthracite coal will be drafted by the responsible individuals of each mine at a meeting on the 16th and submitted for discussion at the second meeting of the Anthracite Regulation Committee on the 18th. (5) The Anthracite Regulation Committee will establish an office in both Nanjing and Shanghai, responsible for coal price review and coal allocation matters. Both offices are scheduled to be established by the 25th. Furthermore, a detailed discussion was held at the meeting regarding augmenting current coal sources. According to attendees, due to military reasons, coal sources are sometimes not very smooth, but there is no widespread shortage expected in anthracite coal supply.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Liang Yingwen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th at the Executive Yuan with representatives from the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, Communications, National Defense, and Finance, as well as the National Resources Commission, to review the "Organizational Regulations of the Anthracite Regulation Committee" and the "Anthracite Supply Measures." Textual revisions have been made and will be submitted for discussion at the temporary political affairs meeting on the 16th.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Four Powers Should Break the Berlin Problem Stalemate with a Spirit of Tolerance and Understanding: Representatives of Neutral Countries Issue a Joint Appeal; Soviets Still Insist the Security Council has No Right to Consult <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The Security Council held a meeting at 3:17 PM (World Standard Time) on the 15th to seek a solution to break the Berlin problem stalemate. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and Ukrainian Representative Manuilsky both attended, with the entire Soviet delegation participating. Vyshinsky carried a large briefcase of documents. After the failure of the six neutral countries' efforts to seek a compromise solution, the debate on the Berlin problem resumed. The United States, Britain, and France had accused the Soviet Union of blockading Berlin, endangering peace. The Soviet Union insisted that the Security Council had no right to consult and that only the foreign ministers of the four occupying powers could handle the German issue. Argentinian Representative Bramuglia, Acting President of the Security Council, called for resolving the Berlin issue with an attitude of "tolerance and understanding." He said that all people who hope for peace are focused on the Security Council. He said the characteristics of the modern era are "revolution, war, and barbaric acts." He stated, "Gentlemen, know that we still have fifty years to live before this terrible century passes."</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome/Paris, 15th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has been resisting since the Security Council began considering the Berlin crisis. On the 15th, he made an unprecedented announcement in the Security Council that the Soviet Union would not answer any questions related to Berlin raised by the Council.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The Security Council's "neutral" countries appealed to the four powers on the 15th to try to resolve their Berlin dispute in a peaceful "private" manner, and issued a warning that if the four powers cannot resolve it as soon as possible, war will break out sooner or later. The Security Council formally requested the four powers to submit a detailed report on the breakdown of the Berlin negotiations and stated that it had no intention of forcing a rapid showdown on the case, as the Western allies hoped.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] The Western countries on the 15th again launched an attack on the Soviet Union in the Security Council. At the same time, all indications are that the heated debate on the Berlin crisis will drag on for the entire week. It is expected that when the Berlin case comes to an end next weekend, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky will veto all motions, and the West will then likely turn to the UN General Assembly to attack the Soviet Union. The Security Council was convened by Argentinian Representative Bramuglia, President of the Security Council, after a nine-day recess. The first priority on the 15th was for the so-called "neutral" countries to thoroughly review the opinions of the Western three powers and the Soviet Union. It is understood that the West is determined to have the majority of the Security Council pass a resolution that the Soviet Union is the aggressor in the Berlin dispute and thus a threat to world peace. Reliable sources say that the Western countries have already abandoned all hope of an early lifting of the Berlin blockade within 24 hours. They say the West is prepared to maintain the airlift to Berlin for the entire winter. Under the guidance of President Bramuglia, representatives of the six "neutral" countries have prepared a questionnaire to be submitted to the Soviet Union and the West at the meeting on the 15th. If they can induce Vyshinsky to answer the questions, his sit-down strike will be broken.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Hoping the UN General Assembly Will Seek a Solution: Building Lasting Peace in the Holy Land; Bunche Issues an Appeal at the Political Committee <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] The UN General Assembly's Political Committee met at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss the Palestine issue. Belgian Representative Spaak presided, and representatives of Transjordan and Israel were allowed to participate but without voting rights. Acting Mediator Bunche warned that the armistice in the Holy Land cannot last and called for the early conclusion of a formal peace treaty or at least a truce agreement. Bunche provided a preliminary report to the Political Committee, unconditionally endorsing the final recommendations of the late mediator Bernadotte.</p>
<p>He also mercilessly condemned the Jewish murderers' assassination of Bernadotte as extremely despicable. Bunche believes that if the UN General Assembly can put forward a reasonable general solution, it is hoped that both the Arab and Jewish sides can agree. He stated that although the two sides have deep-seated grievances, they both hope for peace, as the cost of war is too great and hinders the normal development of both societies. He said that the UN General Assembly should express its views on fundamental issues such as the Jewish state, its borders, international guarantees of the rights of residents in Palestine, Arab refugees, and the United Nations' continued attention to the Holy Land. However, a detailed blueprint is not necessary. The UN General Assembly should allow both parties to resolve the details themselves on major matters based on the UN General Assembly's decisions. Bunche also quoted Bernadotte's appeal to replace the truce agreement with a substantive solution, saying that once the war restarts, the consequences will be disastrous, threatening not only the Middle East but also world peace. Mr. Bunche warned all countries to recognize the existence of the Jewish state. After Bunche finished speaking, the Arab representatives launched an attack. The Syrian representative accused Israel of being responsible for Bernadotte's assassination. Finally, Israeli Representative Eban announced that Foreign Minister Shertok will make a detailed statement next week explaining why his country opposes Bernadotte's solution and will report to the Security Council on the investigation details of Bernadotte's murder. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM, with the date of the next meeting to be determined.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] US Representative Osborn stated at the UN General Assembly's Political Committee debate on the East-West split on the 15th, "The question is, after the war, we have laid down our weapons, while a certain country has expanded its territory?" He criticized the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal, believing that it was not genuine and did not guarantee an explanation of the term "troops." In fact, the Soviet Union does not want other countries to know whether it is reducing its annual quota. Mr. Osborn, an atomic energy expert, has repeatedly debated this issue with the Soviet side for months. The United Kingdom and the United States have adopted a new stance, believing that opposing disarmament does not violate morality.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] The United States rejected the Soviet Union's disarmament plan on the 15th, believing it to be "completely unacceptable" unless the Soviet Union "opens the Iron Curtain" and withdraws its worldwide fifth column. The United Kingdom condemned the Soviet Union for mistreating its own people and maintaining a large-scale "slave system" as "unparalleled in the world."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Frankfurt, 14th, United Press] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie recently stated, "We can be sure that the threat of war will still require another year." Wang came here to exchange views with US military government German director Clay. Wang predicted that 1949 will be a decisive year in terms of war. Wang met with reporters at a magnificent building used to host Wang by the US military and said: "I do not believe that war is imminent. 1949 may be the year to decide war or peace." He said that one of the purposes of his visit was to observe the Berlin airlift. Wang said after inspecting an airfield that he was deeply impressed by the size of the airfield and that the American airlift was even better than he had expected. Wang said that the difficulties of flying over the Hump during the war were greater than those you are experiencing today, but the number of American planes at that time could not be compared with the number of planes that the American authorities here can use.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Yoshida Shigeru paid a visit to Emperor Hirohito on the 15th and held an inauguration ceremony, assuming the post of Japan's sixth Prime Minister after the war. He also plans to pay a courtesy visit to MacArthur on the evening of the 15th. Yoshida immediately began forming a cabinet after being elected Prime Minister on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Two hours after taking office as Prime Minister, Yoshida Shigeru announced that the cabinet could be formed in two or three days and that he would engage in reform movements in political and financial aspects. Yoshida said: "I intend to organize a clean and capable cabinet." Yoshida said: "I will select ministers from people without blemish. The Democratic Liberal Party's policy will not change. Yoshida also said that he will fully support the policies of the Allied Headquarters. Yoshida had a long talk with the Emperor this afternoon and took office at 2:30 PM. The Social Democratic Party recently stated that the Yoshida cabinet is a typical conservative cabinet, extremely reactionary, and the party cannot cooperate with such a government. The Democratic Party and the National Cooperative Party also simultaneously announced that they are opposition parties and will never participate in the Yoshida cabinet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The headquarters for the formation of the new cabinet of Japan's new Prime Minister Yoshida has now moved into the Prime Minister's official residence and has begun the work of forming a cabinet in a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The new cabinet of Prime Minister Yoshida may not last more than two months because the results of last night's parliamentary vote showed that Yoshida cannot grasp the majority support of the Japanese Parliament. Yoshida may face a hostile parliament. Parliament can end the life of the new cabinet at any time. Moreover, the three parties that had previously participated in the government and still hold a majority in the meeting (the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the National Cooperative Party) all cast votes of non-cooperation in last night's vote. Since Yoshida did not obtain the cooperation of the other two major parties, he may form a one-party government, but he may still try to recruit one or two people from non-partisans and the Social Reform Party, because Yoshida did receive their twenty votes. Political figures expect that it will not be easy for Yoshida to recruit enough political talent to fill his sixteen cabinet positions.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Senior officials of our delegation in Japan stated this morning that they hope a pure and moderate policy will continue in Japan and severely criticized the policies of the extreme left and right. When commenting on Yoshida Shigeru's election as the new Prime Minister, he said that Yoshida's cabinet may suddenly be stillborn. He pointed out that Yoshida only received 185 votes, while there were 203 invalid votes, and said that Yoshida Shigeru has too many enemies. The delegation is closely watching Yoshida Shigeru's cabinet formation and expects the cabinet to be of a one-party autocratic nature.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] Brat, former official spokesperson for the US military government in Berlin, severely criticized the report of former military government official Grasu on the 15th, with Mr. Grasu believing that the Soviet Union might be willing to launch a war to seize Berlin. Mr. Brat said in a broadcast, "War will definitely not break out in Germany now, for two reasons: first, US Commander Clay is doing his best to avoid a face-to-face contest and all accidents that may cause face-to-face contests; the other is that the Soviet Union cannot win in war at this time. Transportation is necessary in modern warfare, but we know that the Soviet Union has dismantled all the double-track railways in East Germany and converted them into other facilities."</p>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 14th] Authoritative officials here said on the 14th that 90 heavy tanks had arrived in Austria from Hungary to participate in Soviet army exercises in Duprechtsden.

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Reliable military sources said on the 15th that the high-level defense conference of commanders of the Far East, Alaska, and the Pacific region held here this week should not be regarded as evidence that the US base is advancing to this defense line due to increased threats. In recent weeks, it has been widely rumored that the Soviet Union will adopt a strategy of attacking the US mainland from the northwest, making the situation increasingly serious, but he dismissed this fear as nonsense. He said: "Military commanders must assume any possible attack is coming. In the midst of the tense world situation, overseas commanders will hold more meetings to discuss coordination plans." A spokesperson for MacArthur's headquarters said: "We do not intend to publicly announce the issues and decisions discussed at the meeting." According to reports, the conference was held here for four days, with the participants including Lieutenant General Kunninh, Joint Commander of the Alaskan Defense Forces, Vice Admiral McCrea, Deputy Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, General MacArthur, and their staff. Lieutenant General Kunninh returned to Alaska on the 14th, and Vice Admiral McCrea continued his journey from Pearl Harbor to Qingdao, China, where the headquarters of the US Western Pacific Fleet is located. This conference was the first face-to-face meeting between the three supreme defense commanders of the Pacific since the establishment of the unified command system of the three overseas armies 22 months ago.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The US Air Force announced on the 14th that five B-50 Superfortresses will fly to Alaska in three groups of five each for 45 days of exploratory training, starting on November 1st.

US military leaders are seeking measures to connect Japan and the Far East. According to the US military here, the strength of US troops in the above areas is weak, and they may not be able to resist. Another report: It is widely rumored in the US military that a separate military region will be established in the northwest region of the US mainland.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 15th] Shang Zhen, head of our delegation to Japan, announced today: The major defense line recently decided upon at the high-level US military conference in Tokyo, extending from Alaska through Japan, Okinawa, to the Philippines, clearly does not include China. He neither participated in nor is aware of the details of this US military conference. The British occupation forces were also not consulted by the US, so the defense plans formulated by the US military authorities are purely a US matter. According to well-informed sources: The British occupation authorities were invited to participate in the meeting, but the British commander, Robertson, declined to announce his participation in the meeting. Senior officials from the US Army, Navy, and Air Force met in Tokyo to formulate a defense line against surprise attacks. It is said that the main agenda of the meeting was the liaison between the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the four military districts in case of emergency, to prevent a recurrence of the Pearl Harbor tragedy. According to the US plan, the defense line is clearly established outside the Asian continent.

<h3 id="e66">The Sugar Black Market; The Guild Should Be Responsible; The Director and Secretary Have Been Detained; Supervisor Jiang Believes It Is Due to Artificial Manipulation <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] At 5:45 PM yesterday, the Supervisor's Office ordered the detention of Zheng Yizhou, the director of the Taibei City Sugar Guild, and Zhu Guoming, the guild's secretary. The reason is that the sugar black market has been rampant in recent months, far exceeding the price limit, making it difficult for citizens to purchase sugar. Supervisor Jiang was furious upon hearing this, believing that sugar is the commodity least likely to have a black market, as Taiwan Sugar Corporation regularly distributes large quantities of sugar. The fact that the black market is rampant today clearly indicates artificial manipulation. Therefore, he summoned Zheng Yizhou to the office for questioning yesterday afternoon and severely reprimanded him. At 5:45 PM, Cheng Yi-kuan was ordered to direct the police to detain Zheng and Zhu.</p>
<p>Before being detained, Zheng Yizhou stated that the sugar handled by the Sugar Guild was only part of the total, not all of it, and that most of the wholesalers' sugar had also been allocated to customers. Recently, 4,200 bags and 760 bags were allocated to the Southern Goods Guild and the Biscuit Industry, respectively. He has little stock on hand and cannot be held responsible for the black market.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Second Registration of Seven Daily Necessities to Start Today; The Supervisory Office Instructs All Industries; Existing Stocks Should Be Supplied as Much as Possible <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau will begin the second registration of existing stocks today, designating seven items: sugar (including all varieties), soap (including household, industrial, and all other varieties), wool yarn, kerosene (including domestically refined kerosene), charcoal, matches (including all varieties), and yellow ox. Using today's inventory as the standard, all companies, firms, factories, cooperatives, and material agencies in the city that have the above items in stock and have joined the relevant trade association must report to the Social Affairs Bureau in triplicate according to the form provided by the trade association. Those who have not joined a trade association should send the form directly to the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The deadline for registration is October 23. Those who fail to report or conceal their inventory will be severely punished according to the law once discovered.</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisory Office believes that the purpose of this general registration of major daily necessities in the city is to prevent hoarding by unscrupulous merchants and to understand the inventory of various manufacturers. Recently, some merchants have mistakenly believed that the registered goods have been recognized by the government and can be held for speculation, unwilling to sell them on the market, which defeats the purpose of the general registration. In addition, it has been found that goods manufactured by various manufacturers are often secretly stored in warehouses and are unwilling to be supplied to the market, resulting in market shortages and seriously affecting people's lives. The Supervisory Office has specially requested the Municipal Government to strictly order all manufacturers to supply the registered goods and manufactured goods to the market as much as possible to stabilize the market. After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau has instructed all industries to comply.</p>

In addition to exceeding the price limit, Jindou Shoe Store was also hiding embroidered women's shoes and refusing to sell them, which is suspected of hoarding for speculation. The manager of the store, Jia Juesheng, is a director of the Shoe Guild and has been summoned by the police for questioning. In addition, Gao Hanzhang, the person in charge of Daxinchang Cotton Cloth Store at 257 Tongfu Road, was taken to the police station and released on bail after being reprimanded for not selling cloth according to regulations.</p>

It is now learned that the first batch of these drugs will arrive in port within ten days, including 60,000 ampoules of penicillin and several thousand ampoules of streptomycin, which will be fully distributed to patients.

<p>[This Newspaper] Wan Molin, the chairman of the Rice Guild, Rong Hongyuan, the general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, and Huang Yicong, the manager of Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, were secretly reported to the Economic Supervisor's Office for allegedly being traitors and hoarding for speculation. The Economic Supervisor's Office sent the case to the Special Criminal Court for investigation. The court opened yesterday morning. Wan Molin reported at 9:00 AM. Rong and Huang were in custody for another case and were brought in from the detention center for questioning. At around 9:00 AM, Prosecutor Li Yulong took the stand to question them. Wan presented the Victory Medal and a certificate of martyrdom to prove that he was not a traitor. Prosecutor Li immediately stated that treason cases were not under the jurisdiction of the court and only the hoarding and speculation part would be investigated. He then questioned Wan in detail about the supply and marketing of rice in the city. Wan, Rong, and Huang all denied having engaged in hoarding and speculation. Because the secret report did not provide concrete facts, the investigation was very difficult. After the hearing, Wan Molin was dismissed, and Rong and Huang were returned to custody. According to Prosecutor Li, if the informant cannot provide concrete evidence, the case will be terminated and no further hearings will be held.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Floating Capital Pours Back Into Real Estate; Reaches 100 Million Gold Yuan in Two Months <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>After the currency reform, floating capital tended to buy real estate, creating a postwar boom. According to Chen Shukun, the secretary-general of the Real Estate Guild, the floating capital invested in real estate since August 19 has reached 100 million gold yuan, which is a huge amount, but not as much as expected. The reasons are: (1) Less than one-tenth of the houses and land in the city are immediately available. Vacant land with sheds, factory land, and houses with tenants cannot be investment targets. (2) The difficulty in obtaining building materials has made those who were originally interested in building houses hesitant. It is reported that recently, some people who had obtained building permits from the Public Works Bureau have applied for revocation. Chen said that most of the houses in the city are old and dilapidated, and it is estimated that the depreciation rate after one year will reach 1,000 units per room. If the difficulty of building houses is not resolved quickly, the housing problem in the city in the future will be very worrying. Ma Shaoquan, the chairman of the guild, is scheduled to go to Jiashan within days to purchase brick kilns on behalf of the guild to solve the urgent problem of brick and tile supply.</p>

<h3 id="e77">The Economic Control Supervisor's Office States That It Will Eradicate the Black Market for Gold, Cash, and Cloth; Imported Goods Must Be Reported Within Three Days <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Control Supervisor's Office believes that in the past, price fluctuations in Shanghai were led by gold, cash, and cloth. The office is paying close attention to the incipient black market for gold, cash, and cloth. At 6:00 PM yesterday, a spokesperson for the office publicly stated that although a very small number of black market transactions have occurred recently, the office is paying close attention and believes that this trend cannot be allowed to grow. The office is determined to eradicate it completely. In terms of gold and cash, those caught will be prosecuted under the "Disrupting Finance" clause of the Emergency Financial and Economic Decree promulgated by the government. In terms of cloth, Supervisor Jiang convened a temporary inspection meeting on the afternoon of the 15th and decided to proceed separately to prevent small-scale transactions from gradually spreading. Informants will be rewarded with 40% of the value of the confiscated goods, and those involved will be punished according to law. The same applies to daily necessities such as sugar and oil. The spokesperson also said: According to the office's investigation, there are underground warehouses. Once discovered, regardless of the quantity of goods or the length of storage, all goods will be confiscated, and those involved will be punished for hoarding and speculation. In addition, it has recently been discovered that stores are out of stock, causing inconvenience to citizens. According to a report from the Department Store Guild, this is due to the difficulty in wholesale. Supervisor Jiang has ordered the relevant trade associations to truthfully report the goods they need and ordered the factories to issue them accordingly. In order to strengthen the supply of raw materials, it has been discovered that importers are hoarding goods. The responsible persons of the trade association have been ordered to provide a list of goods that have arrived in the past three months within three days for the office to allocate to various factories to speed up manufacturing and supply to the market.</p>
<h3 id="e78">October Rice Ration to Be Sold Starting Today <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Sufficient Supply Guaranteed</p>
<p>The People's Livelihood Survey Committee has decided to start selling rice through rice stores starting today. Because purchasing from the production areas requires pairing whole rice with broken rice, and the prices are the same, the rice ration in the city will also be sold as a combination of whole rice and broken rice, totaling one dou (15 jin) per coupon, with 12 jin of whole rice and 3 jin of broken rice. The original prices for whole rice and broken rice will be maintained, and the two will be sold together for 9 jiao and 6 fen in gold yuan. Whole rice and broken rice will not be mixed and sold. Citizens are requested to bring two bags when purchasing to avoid confusion or disputes due to different quantities. It is understood that the city needs more than 500,000 shi of rice in October, and sufficient quantities have been prepared. However, because it needs to be transported from various places, the arrival of goods may vary. It is hoped that citizens will not rush and cause disturbances. This batch of rationed rice will be enough to feed more than one million citizens. The second and third batches will arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month, so every citizen will be able to purchase rationed rice before the end of the month and will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] Huang Yujia, an apprentice at the Anchang Pawnshop who murdered for money, was executed by firing squad by the Special Criminal Court yesterday.</p>
<p>The case occurred at 9:00 PM on May 22 last year. Huang, a 25-year-old from Chaozhou, was the nephew of the pawnshop's owner. Because he was resentful of Pan Sanquan, the clerk in charge of the pawnshop's disaster relief, for refusing to lend him money, he killed Pan with a kitchen knife, then went upstairs and stole a large number of gold and silver jewelry and fled to Jinhua where he was arrested. He was originally sentenced to death by the District Court. After the establishment of the Special Criminal Court, the District Court transferred the case to the Special Criminal Court for trial, and he was still sentenced to death. The Central Special Criminal Court believed that he had robbed property and killed Pan Sanquan, and that his wickedness was profound, and approved the execution. At 10:10 AM yesterday, Huang was brought from the Shanghai Prison. Huang was tall and burly, wearing a blue Zhongshan suit, khaki pants, and black basketball shoes. Prosecutor Zhu Cheng took the stand, confirmed his identity, and informed him that the execution would be carried out today. He asked if he had any last words. Huang said that his parents were dead and he had not married, and he had no last words. He then claimed that he was 18 years old, not 25 years old, and hoped for a reduced sentence. The bailiffs persuaded him to drink, and Huang said, "Slowly, what's the rush?" His attitude was still very stubborn. He then drank a bowl of wine and was escorted to the execution ground at 10:25 AM and killed with one shot.</p>

Then he bought items at a low price and left. At around 10:00 AM on the 4th of this month, Wang went to He's store again and falsely claimed that he had received a secret report and was sent to investigate, but he could find a way to be lenient.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Dacheng, a forty-year-old man from Jiangyin who runs a business at No. 15, Lane 1058, Xujiahui Road, has been living with Zhang Cuiying, a woman from Haizhou, for twenty-three years at that location. They have no children together, but Ms. Zhang adopted a daughter, Jin Fang, who is now fifteen years old and treated as her own. However, Wu has a fondness for women, and six years ago, he also became involved with Chen Ahua, a woman from Ningbo, renting a house for her at No. 158 Yongnian Road. They have a son and a daughter together. Later, Ms. Zhang found out about this and often quarreled with Wu. Despite the fact that the situation was irreversible, she remained resentful and harbored a secret desire to harm her. On the morning of the 12th of this month at 10 a.m., Zhang went to Xujiahui alone to buy a butcher knife. Her daughter noticed and hid the knife, but she found it again the next day. That night, Wu was supposed to spend the night with Zhang, but he ended up staying with Chen. On the morning of the 14th, Zhang still hadn't seen Wu return to the shop, so she hid the knife in her clothes and followed him. She saw Wu and Chen sleeping intimately together, and her jealousy overwhelmed her. Just as she was about to draw the knife and attack, Wu woke up and snatched the knife, during which her right finger was cut. At the same time, Ms. Chen cried out for help, alarming the neighbors who called the police. The police arrested Zhang along with the murder weapon and took her to the local police station, where she was charged with attempted murder and handed over to the local procuratorate for interrogation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After Huang Pinfa invented a mileage calculator for tricycles, it has been learned that Sun Wei Yin, a member of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps, has also invented a more complete fare meter for tricycles. This meter can automatically calculate the fare for the entire trip based on the ratio of government-set fares and mileage, using specially made parts inside the meter. It can immediately display the amount due when the vehicle stops, without having to convert mileage into fares. The principle is similar to that of Huang's invention. This type of meter can also be mass-produced in a short period of time using bakelite and other raw materials, at a very low cost. The Youth Service Corps has submitted the invention to the Supervisor's Office for consideration. - Stop and Know the Fare Immediately</p>

<h3 id="e105">Managing Vegetable Markets: Vegetables Sold in Limited Quantities; Daily Arrivals Must First be Registered <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the supply of vegetables and crack down on scalpers, the Laozha Police Sub-bureau, in addition to encouraging vegetable vendors to purchase and sell vegetables from the producing areas, has also begun to implement quantitative sales management of the vegetable market supply. That is, each vegetable vendor must first register the quantity of pork, beef, fish, duck, and eggs with the Management Team of the Vegetable Market Management Committee of the sub-bureau. After the team compiles the total quantity, in addition to a portion being specifically supplied to restaurants, the rest is supplied to the public in limited quantities. Each person can purchase one jin of pork, two jin of half-lean pork, one duck, and a fresh fish weighing about two jin. The quantity of eggs is determined by the amount of goods arriving. The personnel of the management team will closely supervise transactions on the spot. After the implementation of this method at the Fuzhou Road vegetable market for two days, the situation has been very good. However, due to the crowding of buyers, each person only has the opportunity to buy one or two types of vegetables.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Zhu Shilong, Director of the Anthracite Coal Regulation and Supply Office, the main reason for the recent depletion of coal resources in this city is that all the coal transport ships under the office's control have been requisitioned. Therefore, although there are coal reserves in various places, it is temporarily impossible to transport them to Shanghai for supply. However, he is still making every effort to utilize the spare tonnage of other merchant ships for transportation. For example, there are currently 30,000 tons of coal stored in a certain area. A deal has been negotiated for the Huasheng, a ship that travels from port to Taiwan and then to Shanghai, to transport about 8,000 tons, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai within one or two days. There are also about 20,000 tons of coal stored in Tanggu New Port. It would also be possible to negotiate for ships to transport it, but the Kailuan Coal Mine hopes to raise the price of coal to 31 yuan per ton (delivery price at Tanggu Port). If it were transported to Shanghai at this price, it would be impossible to distribute it. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce had already stipulated that the coal price for October would remain the same as the original price in September, so a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions. At the same time, a telegram has also been sent to the Kailuan Coal Mine authorities, hoping that they can first allocate the coal for transportation, and then reply regarding the price. Currently, this city has about 30,000 tons of Kailuan coal (safety coal), and a small amount has already been used. However, if the transportation issue is resolved and the coal supply from various places is smooth, the safety coal can be replenished.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Third Section of the Sui District Headquarters, Operations Section Chief General Li Quan Escapes Danger and Arrives in Qingdao to Discuss the Jinan Campaign <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Qingdao Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 10th] Li Quan, Operations Section Chief of the Third Section of the Jinan Sui District Headquarters, hid among the people after the bandits broke into Jinan. He escaped danger from Jinan on the 28th and arrived in Qingdao after a long and arduous journey. Immediately after removing the dust of travel, he met with reporters to discuss the details of the Jinan campaign. Since the fall of Jinan, rumors have been circulating, with many discrepancies. As for the overall situation of the deployment and conduct of the battle, only those in the command headquarters who directly participated in the battle could know it deeply. This is the inevitable situation in military affairs. Therefore, past piecemeal reports were either based on materials obtained from the Ministry of National Defense or the Xuzhou Command Post, or were not concrete. Li Quan is the only one who has escaped from the command headquarters and come to Qingdao. At the time of the battle, he assisted Chief of Staff Luo Xinli in defending the Sui District Headquarters, managing everything. Therefore, what he says should be the most accurate account of the situation at the time. The following is a transcript of General Li Quan's remarks:</p>
<p>"The bandit army besieged Jinan, using forces from the 3rd, 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, New 8th, Bohai, Liangguang, and Rapid Columns, as well as 300,000 local military region troops. It can be said that they mobilized all their forces in Shandong to attack. Among them, the 7th, 9th, 13th, Bohai, and Rapid Columns were the bandits' elite, all composed of three divisions, attacking our eastern front. The New 8th Column attacked our railway front. North of the Yellow River was the Liangguang Column, and south of Changqing and the railway were the 3rd and 10th Columns, both composed of two divisions, remnants of the Yudong campaign.</p>
<p>The National Army consisted of the 2nd Division (totaling three brigades), the 73rd Division (totaling three brigades), the 84th Division of Wu Huawen (totaling three brigades: the 155th Brigade, the 161st Brigade, and the Independent Brigade), and three security brigades formed by security teams that broke out of Weixian. They defended the city walls, but their combat power and equipment were poor. In addition, there were two battalions of the 74th Division, which were transported by air.</p>
<p>When the battle first started, in addition to Yan Zifeng's troops guarding Changqing and Luokou with one brigade each, the defense of the Jinan area was roughly divided into east and west zones along a vertical line drawn from Luokou, with Cao Zhenduo and Wu Huawen each commanding their respective divisions. Each of the three divisions controlled one brigade as a mobile force.</p>
<p>Fighting Situation on the Outskirts</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the fighting on the outskirts: After the Chen bandits captured Yanzhou in June of this year, they actively prepared to invade Jinan for three months. On the 14th of this (September), they still adopted their usual tactic of feigning an attack in the east while striking in the west. First, the Liangguang Column attacked the north bank of the Yellow River, the 3rd and 10th Columns attacked Changqing, and the New 8th Column attacked the front of the Jinpu Railway. Then, the most elite 7th, 9th, 13th, Bohai, and Rapid Columns launched a fierce attack on the eastern suburbs of Jinan. The curtain on the Jinan defense battle thus opened. After discovering the bandits' intentions, and after fierce fighting, the strongholds in Qihe, Changqing, and other places on the western front of Jinan were gradually abandoned on the 15th, and they were transferred to the established positions on the outer perimeter of Jinan. (Deployment of positions as shown in the attached map.)</p>
<p>After dusk on the 16th, the bandits began a fierce attack on the Maocen Mountain and Yanchi Mountain positions in the eastern suburbs of the city. The bandits first bombarded with intense artillery fire, followed by infantry assaults. The fighting was fierce throughout the night, and the defending troops suffered heavy casualties. The defending army battalion commander, Zhu Guanghua, was executed for ineffective combat. On the 17th, the bandits attacked Xunliuzhuang, and the battle became even more intense. The defending troops were determined to coexist with the position. After a day of fierce fighting, the entire 45th Regiment of the 15th Brigade was heroically sacrificed. Regiment Commander Li Pu was wounded and committed suicide with a grenade. On the 18th, the bandits continued their westward attack on Majiazhuang, and the 19th and 57th Brigades were deployed to reinforce. The battle for Majiazhuang was the most intense. The bandits and our troops each occupied half of the village. After four days and nights of bloody fighting, the bandits' offensive was slightly thwarted due to heavy casualties, and the battle situation on the eastern front gradually stabilized. As of this day, the National Army's outer defense battle was entirely on the eastern front, and the initial plan to hold firm had been completed. According to accurate judgment, the bandits' elite 9th Column had suffered almost complete casualties. The remaining troops also suffered heavy losses. The distance between the bandits and our troops was only one to two hundred meters.</p>
<p>At 6:00 p.m. on the 19th, it was suddenly reported by Wang Tongyu, regiment commander of the 465th Regiment of the 155th Brigade of Wu Huawen's unit, that Wu's unit would defect at 12:00 p.m. that night and would attack the commercial port. The defection was sudden, and the situation was shocking. The four brigades of troops that could be commanded were still fighting the bandits on the outer perimeter. Wu's three brigades were still intact. Given the situation at the time, the situation was extremely critical. The original plan was to break through in two directions, north and south, but due to the heavy encirclement by the bandits and Wu's rebels, and the fact that the eastern front was still engaged in intense fighting with the bandits, it was not easy to disengage the battlefield. However, at the beginning of the planned action, Mu Zhongheng and Director Liao Weiwen (Third Section) and others had successfully broken through to the north. Various external rumors were all hearsay. Finally, after discussions between the command headquarters and the division and brigade commanders, it was decided that the main force would defend the city walls and that a portion would defend the southern suburbs of Sili Mountain and Qianfo Mountain, as well as the commercial port's Provincial Hospital, Packaging Factory, the Postal Building where the Sui District Headquarters was located, and key points such as the former German Consulate and the railway station. At that time, more than a regiment of Wu Ni Huawen's troops had infiltrated the western part of the city. Wang Sherenzhuang was still defended by the Licheng County team. Zhang Jingyue was originally responsible for the defense of the city walls, but by this point, he no longer had any tasks.</p>
<p>The Course of the Battle in the Urban Area</p>
<p>Next, I will describe the course of the battle in the urban area: The entire day of the 20th was quiet. At night, Wu Huawen's troops opened up the front, and the bandit army entered the urban area and attacked our strongholds in the city. The defending troops resisted bravely, but all attempts were unsuccessful. The struggle for the Provincial Hospital was particularly fierce. In the urban area, the bandits attacked the Yonggu Gate near the outer east city, and climbed the city walls several times, but were all annihilated and repelled. The three security brigades were extremely brave in defending the Puli Gate, Hanshi Bridge, Yonggu Gate, and Qilu University.</p>
<p>On the 21st, the bandits continued to attack the key points of the commercial port. The Wang Buqing Regiment of the 211st Brigade, which defended the Provincial Hospital, was completely and heroically sacrificed after two days and nights of fierce fighting. The struggle for the main railway station and the postal building was extremely fierce. The bandits who attacked the railway station had a regiment annihilated by our Ma Peiji Brigade. In the urban area, the bandits' attacks on the east city were the most intense. At midnight, a unit broke into the Yonggu Gate.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the defending troops at the commercial port railway station, the postal building, the former German consulate, and other strongholds broke out to the west and north due to excessive casualties, and then communication was cut off. In the urban area, the bandits who broke into the Yonggu Gate continued to increase their forces and attacked the inner city. The bandits at Hanshi Bridge also launched a massive offensive, climbing the city walls several times, but were all annihilated and repelled. Later, due to excessive casualties among the defending troops, the bandits broke in, and there was a street-by-street struggle, which was extremely fierce. They gradually moved to the innermost core position to hold firm.</p>
<p>At 6:00 p.m. on the 23rd, the bandits used more than a hundred large-caliber guns to concentrate their fire on the inner city, attempting to first destroy our command center. For a time, shells rained down, flames filled the sky, and the entire city was a sea of fire. More than 10,000 shells were fired, and there was no place in the city where shells did not fall. In particular, the provincial government and the old provincial government Huangting, where the command headquarters was located, received the most shells. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented in the War of Resistance against Japan and the various bandit suppression campaigns. At this time, a concrete bunker behind the provincial government was hit by an armor-piercing shell, and many provincial government personnel were sacrificed. The special service regiment also sacrificed fifty or sixty people in an hour under the artillery fire. Our artillery positions were moved into the provincial government, the old provincial government, and Huangting. The anti-aircraft guns and other defenses were fired excessively and exploded. At this time, the air force reconnaissance only saw a sea of fire, which shows the intensity of the artillery fire. Communication was completely cut off, and even the buried cables were broken. The bandits then launched a large-scale infantry attack on the east, south, and west sides of the city, climbing the city walls. At that time, the commander and the division and brigade commanders personally supervised the battle at the edge of the city, and the morale was extremely high. The bandits broke in five times in the southeast corner, but were all annihilated. The bandits' eleven offensives in the southwest corner were repelled. At dawn on the 24th, the city walls in the southeast corner, Xindong Gate, and the meteorological station were destroyed by the bandits' artillery, leaving three breaches. Due to excessive casualties among the defending troops, the bandits broke in from the breaches, and fierce street fighting broke out in the city. At 10:00 a.m., when the bandits approached Huangting, the commander led the personnel of the command post near Beijige, but was blocked by Daming Lake, and the strength of the defending troops had been exhausted. By this time, there was no way to reverse the critical situation. He was forced to lead the remaining troops of the special service regiment and a part of Wang Jingzhen's 15th Brigade to break out to the north. The situation thereafter is unknown. The bandits in the city continued to press westward, fighting house by house. At 4:00 p.m., they attacked and entered the provincial government. At that time, the west of the provincial government and the northwest corner of the city were still defended by the remnants of Qian Boying's 77th Brigade. At dawn on the 25th, the bandits launched another large-scale attack. The defending troops were strong and resisted to the death. After a fierce battle until 5:00 p.m., all the defending troops were heroically sacrificed. The battle in the urban area came to an end. However, there were still sporadic battles after nightfall, and sparse gunshots. At that time, Qianfo Mountain and Sili Mountain in the southern suburbs were still in our hands, and the defending troops in Wang Sherenzhuang broke out to the south. At dawn on the 26th, the bandits attacked Qianfo Mountain and Sili Mountain in the southern suburbs. After a day of fierce fighting, the Hu Jingyuan regiment of the 213th Brigade and a battalion of Wang Jingzhen's 15th Brigade broke out to the south. Thus, the Jinan defense battle came to an end. The radio of the commander's command post at Beijige was cut off from external contact at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th. The radio of Chief of Staff Luo at the provincial government command headquarters was cut off from external contact at 4:00 p.m. on the same day.</p>
<p>Reasons for Abandoning Jinan City</p>
<p>The Jinan defense battle began with the preliminary battle on September 14 and ended with the fall of the southern suburban mountains on the 26th, totaling twelve days and nights of bloody fighting. It is estimated that more than 60,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and we also suffered more than 40,000 casualties. Especially in the final urban area battle, under extremely difficult conditions, the officers and soldiers of the National Army gave their lives, and their morale was high. They were all determined to coexist with the city, and they were extremely loyal, brave, and heroic. If Wu Ni Huawen had not defected midway, Jinan could definitely have been secured without worry.</p>
<p>The reasons for abandoning Jinan were, first, Wu Huawen's defection. By the 19th, the National Army had lost about two of its six brigades. Wu Huawen's three brigades were still intact, and Wu's troops knew everything about the National Army's combat plans and the internal situation in Jinan. The second was the forced retreat to the urban area, which changed the entire combat plan. The original plan was to use Xinzhuang, Ma'anshan, Qianfo Mountain, and other places as the final core positions, with two-thirds of the food and ammunition stockpiled near Xinzhuang. Wu's rebellion took place suddenly, and the National Army was forced to change its plan and use the urban area as the core.</p>
<p>The third was that the urban area had dense houses and narrow streets, which were not conducive to street fighting. At the same time, the houses outside the city were too close to the city walls, and they were all high-rise buildings. After the Lunan campaign, in order to meet military needs, we once planned to demolish some of the houses to clear the firing range, but it was opposed by local gentry and could not be thoroughly implemented, which is very regrettable."</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Hankou, 15th] A bizarre drama of failing to obtain an official position has recently occurred in the Hubei Provincial Government. Cheng Yaobi, a qualified county magistrate assigned to this province by the Administrative Yuan's Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee, has been assigned as an inspector by the provincial government for a long time without obtaining a substantive position, and is very dissatisfied. He has publicly stated that Director Deng extorted gold bars from him, and has written to the provincial government stating: "I am a qualified county magistrate selected by the central government, and there is no need for me to move to another position. However, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of your government has repeatedly indicated the conditions for socializing, but I am poor and cannot comply. Even if I were rich, I would not be willing to bribe my way into an official position," etc. Upon receiving the report, Deng also issued a statement saying: "It has been found that this official has a volatile temperament and shallow academic qualifications, and is not suitable for immediately serving as a county magistrate. This department has assigned him as an inspector in order to give him the opportunity to observe. Now that this official has failed to obtain an official position, he dares to slander his superiors with absurd words. His nerves are obviously not very sound. If he is assigned to govern a county, it will inevitably harm the local area," and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Abnormal Relationship of Cotton Cloth in Nantong Urgently Needs to Be Broken (Part 1) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Cong Yongshu</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nantong, 12th] The tide of "shortages" and "panic buying" is attacking northern Jiangsu with the chilling autumn wind. The calm of northern Jiangsu after the currency reform has once again been disturbed by price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Rugao, which exports pigs, is experiencing a meat shortage, and Nantong, which produces cotton, is complaining that it cannot collect cotton. Daily necessities, silk, and department stores are even more "short in stock" because they are "imported goods."</p>
<p>Flow of Materials Eastward</p>
<p>Take Nantong as an example. The price limits are only stricter in the urban areas. The prices of various goods in the eastern part of Nantong are generally higher than in the urban areas, resulting in the phenomenon of materials flowing eastward. Some people have even temporarily changed careers to become "scalpers." It is said that if you can buy a small package of foreign yarn from the city and transport it to an area thirty to fifty miles to the east, you can at least earn five gold yuan.</p>
<p>In the towns, it is also difficult to buy rice. The limited price for good rice has now been replaced by inferior rice. If you want to buy it, it will be something with a moldy taste and mixed with sand. Buying cloth is also troublesome. The cloth in the windows of cloth stores has become much sparser. If you want to choose the quality or pattern, the clerk will say: the good ones have already been sold, and there is no way to replenish them. There are only these few kinds left. There is also no meat. Since entering October, there has been no limited-price meat for sale. The military meat that is supplied at a subsidized price has also not been supplied for ten days. Only restaurants and "eaters" who love meat like their own lives send people to drill into the black market. The fish stalls are always empty. The fishmongers stand by and greet familiar patrons to choose at their homes. This is a favor, and the price has to be calculated accordingly. Tofu and dried tea have not risen in price, and there is no black market, but the volume has shrunk by nearly one-third. Green vegetables, radishes, and taro are common vegetables, and have almost doubled in price compared to ten days ago. Everyone is only afraid of not being able to buy them, and does not ask whether the price has risen or not.</p>
<p>Reasons for Shortages</p>
<p>The reasons for the "shortages" can probably be divided into two aspects. One aspect is affected by the "prohibition of exports" in other places and the "price limits" in this area. The prohibition of exports in neighboring places has made the source of goods difficult, naturally forming a shortage phenomenon. After the price limits, merchants from other ports are mostly calculating how much money they can earn by transporting goods to a certain place, and avoid transporting goods to this side. More importantly, northern Jiangsu is closer to the bandit areas than southern Jiangsu, and the bandit army is carrying out economic destruction here. Now is the autumn harvest season, and the fields of northern Jiangsu have golden grains, silvery white cotton, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains. However, the cities in the fields of northern Jiangsu are experiencing food and cotton shortages. The scattered bandits in the rural areas are agitating to cover up the "autumn tax collection" work. The government districts have price limits on all kinds of goods, and they are buying them at any price. The profiteers only recognize making money. As long as there is money to earn, and the more they earn, the more they do not care about anything and do everything they can to extract goods from the price limits to obtain more illegal profits.</p>
<p>Quality Deteriorating Daily</p>
<p>Cotton cloth is an economic link formed by agriculture, industry, and handicrafts in Nantong, and it is an economic feature of Nantong.</p>
<p>The area near Nantong is a cotton-producing area, and this time of year is usually the time when "cotton flows like clouds" (the horizontal strip often posted at cotton shops). But this year it is not the same. On the one hand, there are price limits on cotton, and cotton farmers do not want to use money and are unwilling to sell cotton. On the other hand, most of the cotton fields are in bandit areas, and cotton cannot be transported out. Under these circumstances, small manufacturers are scrambling to buy, weighing 100 jin of seed cotton and calculating the price of 115 jin to 120 jin, that is, increasing the price of cotton by 15% to 20%. This way of doing black market is called "releasing the scale" or "pulling the scale." Because of the scramble to buy, even mixed and watered cotton are bought. As long as it is cotton, it is bought, resulting in the price of cotton rising daily and the quality deteriorating daily.</p>

<h3 id="e112">With the Development of Purchasing Work by the Industry, Rice Arrivals in the Rice Market Are Gradually Increasing, and Rice Merchants Are Finding It Quite Difficult Due to the Suppression of Rice Quantities in Various Places <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the rice industry began its purchasing work, arrivals have been gradually increasing. Yesterday, 151 shi were reported to the Nanshi market by traders, and 387 shi and 7 dou were reported by rice shops. 723 shi were reported to the Beishi market by traders, and 174 shi were reported by rice shops, and 373 shi and 7 dou were reported by rice mills, totaling 1,709 shi and 4 dou. Except for rice shops and rice mills supplying their own retail stores, the goods from the traders were all sold on the market at the limited price.</p>
<p>The transaction of miscellaneous grains was slack, with only sporadic sales. The price of Guiyang black beans was 20 yuan for several tens. Black sesame seeds opened 13 packages, priced at 28 yuan. Kaifeng Tizhuang peanuts sold 12 packages, priced at 32 yuan and 7 jiao. Everything else was not sold.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to a certain leading figure in the rice industry, after rice merchants in the city contracted to handle 200,000 dan of rice for the city, they are currently purchasing from various production areas separately. The more distant areas are Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jintan, which account for a larger volume. The nearer areas are Songjiang, Qingpu, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changshu, which account for a smaller volume. However, the transport of rice to Shanghai from various places is often detained by the local authorities, which inevitably delays the date of transport to Shanghai. Recently, the situation has improved after the supervisors' office sent telegrams to negotiate separately. The first batch of rice from Songjiang, about 1,000 dan, can arrive in Shanghai within two or three days after being released. However, they are most troubled by two points: (1) The amount of rice purchased from various places is often suppressed. For example, in Suzhou, the limited price for every 154 jin should be 18 yuan. Although the limited price has not changed recently, the amount has been suppressed from 154 jin to 140 jin, and even to the most recent 132 jin. The same is true for Dangshu. The limited price of 18 yuan for every 154 jin has recently been reduced to only 110 jin or so. This directly affects the cost of handling rice. (2) The rice purchased from various places has a very rough appearance. In the future, when it is transported to Shanghai for sale, some misunderstandings are inevitable. Therefore, the Rice Merchants' Association yesterday submitted a report to the Supervisors' Office, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Special Police Department, and the Economic Police Brigade, five agencies, requesting instructions for relief measures, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Cotton Yarn Required for the Reproduction Industry Will Be Handled and Rationed as a Whole, and a Meeting Will Be Held by the Materials Adjustment Committee to Discuss <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of cotton yarn supply for the reproduction industry, Pan Tuhao, chairman of the industry's association, once discussed the allocation of yarn with Yu Hongjun, president of the National Bank, and proposed a public and unified allocation method to maintain the production of the industry. It is heard that Pan's proposal has been approved by President Yu, and a meeting will be held by the Materials Adjustment Committee within days to discuss the matter. According to the person in charge of the industry, the current stock of 20-count cotton yarn required by the industry in Shanghai is more than 10,000 pieces from the National Bank, 3,000 pieces from the Textile Adjustment Committee, and 45,000 pieces of US aid yarn. The actual monthly yarn requirement of the industry is 40,000 pieces, so they are still concerned about the supply issue in the future. The 30,000 pieces of cotton yarn required by the industry have been approved by the Economic Management and Supervision Office, but have not yet been allocated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn and cloth markets continued to be closed. The Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual, opening blue orders for 20-count Qiuhuo at a price of 700 yuan, which was purchased by yarn merchants from other ports. White orders were 6-count Fu Riguang at 255 yuan, 15-count Shouyunian straw bales at 573 yuan, 32-count double-strand Fengnian big bales at 880 yuan, 42-count double-strand Lima cones at 990 yuan, 42-count double-strand second-class Jane cones at 960 yuan, and 40-count three-strand Baoguang straw bales at 1,030 yuan. The 15-count yarns were limited to blanket manufacturers to apply for purchase, the 32-count yarns were limited to electrical film manufacturers, and the 21-count yarns were limited to optional purchases.</p>
<p>In addition, the Textile Construction Company's out-of-town yarn allocation for the first half of October included 43 pieces of 20-count Jiushi for Wuxi, 30 pieces for Wujin, and 40 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing, 33 pieces of 20-count Jiushi for Dangshu, 9 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing for Wuxian, 18 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing for Jiangyin, 25 pieces for Nanhui, 6 pieces for Pinghu, 9 pieces for Chuansha, and 5 pieces for Songjiang, and 9 pieces for Xin Yunhui, totaling 227 pieces. The price was 700 yuan each. Blue order forms must be used for purchase orders, and the yarn payment must be paid to the Bund Central Bank.</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Association yesterday afternoon distributed approximately 12,000 pieces of cloth produced by private factories, including more than 2,000 pieces of white cloth and approximately 9,000 pieces of colored cloth (including printed cloth and sound-printing cloth). There were more than 80 types of patterns and varieties. The distribution price was based on the "August 19" limited price distribution method. In order to ensure uniformity, the distribution was divided into five groups: wholesalers, retail stores, bulk merchants, retail merchants, and finishing factories. The distribution unit was 10 pieces per purchase. It is heard that there were more than 1,500 registered purchasers. The New Feng Printing and Dyeing Factory had the largest number of distributed cloths in this period.</p>

<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the sale of government materials, the Property Committee, the Taizhou bidding materials, the bulk of which was a large number of broken rice entrusted by the Mindi Commission to be sold by tender, totaling about 20,000 bags. There was also a batch of newsprint, which was also sold by tender on the 15th. There was quite a crowd of rice and paper merchants from the city who went to apply for the tender. According to the person in charge of the association, in recent weeks, each time the materials were sold by tender, all of them were fully bid, and there was almost a situation of demand exceeding supply. Therefore, the bidding of woolen fabrics has been temporarily suspended this week, and will be resumed after the method is improved.</p>

<p>Regarding the direct import of industrial raw materials from abroad to increase production, the Supervisor's Office has now reached a new decision. The method involves the National Bank issuing an additional 20 million US dollars outside the foreign exchange allocation quota, entrusting the China Trust Bureau to be responsible for procurement.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to discussions with major industrialists and businessmen in the city, although self-provided foreign exchange has been opened, price adjustments for goods are still not possible. The difficulties felt by the industrial and commercial sectors are still numerous. Due to rising overseas prices, the import cost of industrial raw materials is very high, and most finished products using imported raw materials cannot be sold at the limited price. At present, the capital of various industrial factories is meager, and they cannot directly remit funds to order goods from abroad. If importers see no profit, they have no intention of importing. Therefore, in addition to hoping for the opening of self-provided foreign exchange, it is also hoped that the authorities will reasonably adjust the prices of imported raw materials and finished products.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market continued to see mediocre trading and narrow transactions, with a quiet and uneventful process. Prices remained consistent with previous assessments. It is learned that the Chinese government recently shipped a large quantity of black tea to the Soviet Union, reportedly for debt repayment. It is also said that a batch of high-quality Ping Shui green tea will also be exported to the same destination and preparations for collection and assembly are currently underway. Another dispatch states that Qimen black tea, most favored by the British, has been lacking due to disparity in sales negotiations. However, recently, due to urgent overseas demand, exporters have regained momentum and are again consulting with principals.</p>

<p>Recently, popular cigarette brands have disappeared from the market again, with it being nearly impossible to purchase brands such as Da Nan Wei San Pao Tai. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this and has notified the Yizhong Company and Yongtaihe to expedite delivery. It is reported that the reason for the current shortage of Yizhong cigarettes is (1) citizen hoarding, and (2) insufficient distribution. Even with distribution, huge quantities of goods are quickly snatched up. It is said that both parties are considering a good method to curb hoarding.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to information from the cigarette industry, most of the high-quality tobacco leaves come from abroad, but they are now nearly absent. Therefore, the raw materials for high-quality cigarettes have become a major problem. Furthermore, after cigarettes are made, they must be stored for one or two months, otherwise the cigarettes will be hard and tight and cannot be smoked. Currently, in order to meet market demand, factories are shipping cigarettes immediately after production, with little or no stock.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Sharp Decline in Tung Oil Production in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Although Zhejiang Province is not one of the largest tung oil-producing provinces in the country, through years of government promotion, the area planted with tung trees reached 65,607 mu by 1941. The producing areas are distributed in more than 40 counties in the upstream of the Qiantang River and the Ou River basin. Since the tung tree planting areas are all mountainous regions, with barren land and poor people, farmers regard tung tree planting as a major sideline. North of the Xin'an River, the three counties of Fen Shui, Chun'an, and Yu Qian each produced around 15,000 dan in 1941, accounting for one-fifth of the province's total output, making them the most productive areas for tung oil in the province. In addition, counties such as Jiang Shan, Shou Chang, Jin Yun, Jian De, Xian Ju, etc., each produced more than 10,000 dan, and counties such as Sui Chang, Lan Xi, Tong Lu, Li Shui, Chang Shan, Jin Hua, Yong Jia, Zhu Ji, Xuan Ping, and Tai Shun, etc., each produced more than 5,000 dan, all of which are major tung oil-producing counties. The province's total annual output is around 200,000 dan, accounting for one-tenth of the national output.</p>
<p>Before the war, tung oil produced in Zhejiang was sold in various counties within the province, accounting for one-quarter. Those transported to other provinces and abroad accounted for three-quarters. The concentration points for tung oil transported to other places were Hangzhou, Yongjia, Quzhou, and Lanxi. During the peak season, oil factories would set up shops to handle business, transporting tung oil from Quzhou and Lanxi to Hangzhou or Yongjia, and then re-exporting it. In the early days of the War of Resistance, tung oil was a major military supply. Under the government's efforts to promote the tung tree planting industry in Zhejiang Province, it became a trend. The area of tung forests increased year by year. According to a survey, the output in the three years of 1937 and 1940 almost doubled compared to before the war. The tung oil exported through Wenzhou and Ningbo reached 165,157 dan in 1938, 221,645 dan in 1939, and 130,403 dan in 1940. If it could have been promoted smoothly, the tung oil production in the province would not have been difficult to exceed 1 million dan. However, the situation changed, the sea ports were blocked, and the occupied areas gradually expanded. After 1941, due to transportation difficulties, purchasing agencies failed to purchase as much as possible, resulting in goods being abandoned on the ground, with no one to care. Subsequently, food prices soared and wages increased, and tung farmers even cut down tung trees and replanted miscellaneous grains, resulting in a sharp decline in tung oil production. Fortunately, in 1942, the tung oil gasoline production test was successful, and oil refineries on both sides of the Ou River were established in succession, using tung oil to extract gasoline, kerosene, and diesel to supply the needs of the rear, which helped to reverse the decline of tung oil to a great extent. After the victory, it was estimated that the tung oil production in each county had decreased by at least 25% and at most 75% compared to before the war, with an average statistic of 50%, and the province's annual output was only about 80,000 dan.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Reduced Pig Supply, Difficulties in Intestine Export <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to information from the sausage casing export industry, recently, due to the reduced supply of vegetables in Beijing, Shanghai, and their suburbs, residents have difficulty obtaining meat. Even occasional pig slaughtering is mostly sought through the black market, and even pig intestines are snatched up. Now, due to the fact that supplying domestic consumption is more profitable than exporting, the source of sausage casing has been cut off. The Jiangbei area, which used to be the main supplier of sausage casing, has also reduced its supply due to poor conditions. Not only is the purchase price too high, but it is also impossible to purchase in large quantities. Sausage casing is produced in various countries and is not unique to us. Now that the domestic purchase price is high and the overseas sales price is not optimistic for the time being, most sausage casing exporters have withdrawn. The small amount of dried intestines purchased are transported to Guangdong and Hong Kong for making sausages and cannot be exported.</p>
<h3 id="e121">No Silk Available <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Silk Association's rationing of raw silk saw a daily decrease in applicants. The allocated amount was insufficient, and the small quantities were not enough to satisfy applicants. The sales quota at silk stores was also limited yesterday, restricting sales. Silk weaving businesses had separate allocations, but the quantity was limited. There was no silk available for domestic or export sales, and trading was sluggish, with no transactions heard throughout the day. Sales of silk fabrics have been slow recently, but purchasing by merchants from other regions has been active, and factories are receiving orders and are unable to accept any more, often refusing them.</p>
<h3 id="e122">For Remittances Over 1,000 Yuan, the Recipient Must Provide a Guarantee <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Financial Management Bureau, following the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, stated: "This Ministry stipulates that for domestic remittances handled by money shops and banks, if the amount of each transaction exceeds 200 million legal tender, the recipient should provide a reliable guarantee to prove the accuracy of their name and address before payment is allowed. Since the currency reform, after careful examination of the current situation, the original regulations should be appropriately modified. It is now revised to state that if the recipient is a legitimate business in the remittance bank's local area that has joined the trade association and is well-known to the bank, they may be exempted from providing a guarantee. If the recipient is an individual and the remittance amount exceeds 1,000 yuan, they must still provide a reliable guarantee to prove the accuracy of their name and address before payment is allowed. If there are restrictions on the payment of remittances in a specific area, the regulations of that area should be followed." The bureau has instructed the Taishi Money Shop and Trust Association to pass this on to all banks, shops, and companies for compliance.</p>

Discussing "Education and Philosophy," he said that true educators do not regard education as a career, but rather broaden their outlook on life and teach the next generation with tireless enthusiasm. Zhang praised Zhou Jiaoyi and Cheng Mingjin of the Song Dynasty as true great educators, and compared himself to a failed educator. He believes that educators must look at the universe from the perspective of Taoism and act according to Confucianism. In addition, Yu Jiaju, leader of the Youth Party, also arrived in Hankou by boat on the 15th to give lectures.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Professors in the Capital Jointly Appeal to the Authorities, Demanding Improved Treatment for Public Educators, While Submitting 11 Funding Suggestions <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Qiu Zhizhong, Cui Jingbo, Fang Hao, Shao Yulin, Li Dongfang, Yang Zhaolong, and 105 other professors from universities in the capital recently jointly issued a public appeal to the authorities demanding improved treatment for public educators. It stated that since the currency reform, the base salary for public educators has been too low, while prices in various places have continued to rise, and the purchasing power of the gold yuan has fallen to only one-sixth of the pre-war legal tender. However, the treatment of public educators is only one-twenty-fourth of the pre-war real value. Moreover, salaries are frozen indefinitely, while prices are rising indefinitely, which is not only unreasonable in fact, but will also put public educators to death. Poor treatment of public educators will inevitably lead to daily preoccupation with firewood, rice, oil, and salt, resulting in low administrative efficiency and the failure of the political and academic environment. This will not only directly affect the country's expectations of increasing revenue, but also indirectly undermine the success of emergency financial and economic measures to reform the currency, and even endanger the great cause of national construction. They demanded that starting from August, all public educators nationwide should receive gold yuan salaries that are double their original salary amount based on the pre-war currency value. However, in order to consider the burden on the national treasury, personnel at all levels voluntarily donate one-quarter of their salary as a special contribution for national construction and relief. Another quarter will be used for a savings association, until the end of the war. It is estimated that the government will have an additional expenditure of approximately 1.5 billion yuan per year, but it is believed that if appropriate measures are taken, even if salaries are raised to pre-war standards or even higher, it is not impossible. They put forward eleven funding suggestions: (1) Eliminate redundant agencies. (2) Eliminate redundant personnel. (3) Reduce special treatment for state-owned enterprises. (4) Eliminate all rations for public educators. (5) Eliminate all subsidies in addition to salaries. (6) Ban dual employment and dual salaries. (7) Verify and issue military pay. (8) Reduce special budget expenditures. (9) Reorganize all public funds and property. (10) Effectively rectify tax collection. (11) Confiscate overseas deposits of corrupt groups. Finally, they questioned whether the Weng Cabinet will abandon its responsibility as a responsible cabinet in the face of the current serious problems.</p>

<p>Donghua vs. Yinghang Changed to Friendship Game</p>
<p>The Group A playoff of the Third Small Football League was held at Jinyuan Park at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. In the first half of the game between Zhichao and Nengtou in Group A, Zhichao's Yin Qingbing scored first, taking a 1-0 lead. After changing sides, the battle resumed. Due to overly strict offense and defense, the two sides were difficult to distinguish. Three minutes before the end of the game, Longtou launched a full-scale counterattack. Zhichao was forced into a corner kick. Some spectators suspected it was a nine-yard penalty kick and rushed into the field to beat the referee, causing chaos and making the game impossible to continue, so it was stopped midway. After being suppressed by the authorities, the order of the field was restored to normal. The second game between Donghua and Yanghang then continued to begin, but because it was already late, both sides agreed to change it to a friendly game. Donghua's Chen Mingzhe scored a goal, and Yanghang lost to Donghua 0-1.</p>
<p>Since both games had no results, the original schedule for the total championship semi-final was postponed. The committee will convene another committee meeting next Monday (the 18th) to discuss and then announce.</p>

<p>The curtain of this year's football season was raised yesterday. The British Navy warship Sussex football team returned from Hong Kong. The Football Committee specially scheduled a friendly match with the China Aviation Football Team at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. The audience was sparse, only a few hundred people. The entire Northeast Wind Football Team came to watch. The result was a 1-1 draw, with no score in the first half. The referee was Jiang Yinseng, and the linesmen were Wang Chongye and Jin Xibo.</p>
<p>No Score</p>
<p>China Aviation kicked off and had a strong offensive. Fu Zhibin made a solo run, dribbling to the penalty area. He lightly passed to Liu Longyu, but Liu's shot was too weak, and it hit the goalkeeper Pierre. Shortly after, Liu Tishi got the ball and attacked. Pierre rushed out, and Madison chipped the ball towards his own goal, almost creating a comical own goal. The British Navy launched a full-scale attack. Yang Baoluo fouled, and a free kick was awarded at the 20-yard mark. Carter took the kick, and the ball shot out like an arrow. Xu Fusheng dove to save the ball, turning danger into safety. Suddenly, the British right winger Mars advanced along the sideline and made a diagonal shot that missed by only a foot. The first half ended with a score of 0-0.</p>
<p>One Goal Each, Draw</p>
<p>After the break, China Aviation replaced Liang Mingxing with Yuan Liufu, with no other changes. After the restart, the British army launched a fierce attack. The area in front of the China Aviation goal was under constant duress. Fortunately, Xu Fusheng and Zhuang Wenquan resolutely defended their territory, ensuring safety. China Aviation counterattacked, but it was difficult to achieve results. Soon, the British army came again. Right winger Mars had a moment of inspiration and scored the first goal. China Aviation was not willing to give in. The five forwards advanced. Yuan Liufu slipped in front of the goal, missing a good opportunity. Shortly after, Fu Zhibin got the ball and dribbled forward, lightly passing to Liu Longxing. Liu took a shot near the goal, and the British goal was breached, tying the score at 1-1. When time ran out, the two sides shook hands and drew with a score of 1-1.

<p>The first Guangdong Cup Basketball League organized by the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai originally set the registration deadline for the 15th of this month. Many teams have already registered, but each team has not yet completed its organization. The Group B teams in the competition are limited to Guangdong natives, which is especially difficult. Therefore, it is requested that the deadline be extended to the 20th of this month. Non-Guangdong teams can also apply for Group A. The registration location is the association's office at the intersection of Jiangning Road and Xinkai Road. The fee is five yuan per team, and the security deposit is ten yuan. Detailed rules and regulations are available upon request.</p>

<h3 id="e145">The Manufacturers of the Feeble-Minded <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>- Lei Ting</p>
<p>Because I am one of the teachers, I have seen some unreasonable facts in the so-called "purity," so I have a lot of feelings of "speaking my mind."</p>
<p>Now everyone is saying that after the Anti-Japanese War, the level of middle school students has greatly declined, especially in Chinese, English, and Mathematics. This is a fact, but it cannot be said to be a fact only after the war.</p>
<p>Because this is a fact, in newspapers and magazines, you can often read professors' satirical doggerel poems about students, or many examiners' sighs of contempt; in the eyes of some professors or examiners, two not-so-decent words inevitably appear more or less: "Feeble-minded"!</p>
<p>Feeble-minded, do we really have so many feeble-minded young people? Can war create so many feeble-minded young people? This cannot but make people doubt. Because "genius" is indeed rare and valuable, "feeble-minded" is not necessarily everywhere. "Genius" and "feeble-minded" should both be a very small number among a very small number.</p>
<p>Since feeble-mindedness should be as rare as genius, why is it so common now? In my opinion, the formation of this reality should not be blamed on nature, but on nurture; in a word, it is: artificial destruction.</p>
<p>To understand this artificial destruction, we should first face the educational system of our country today.</p>
<p>Because I have been teaching Chinese for a longer time, I might as well talk about the general situation of Chinese professors today, even though this is only one of the three subjects that are generally considered to be of too low a standard.</p>
<p>Before talking about the main topic, I have to spit out a sentence that has been hidden in my heart for a long time: There are too many subjects in middle schools now, too heavy, and too complicated. It is so complicated and heavy that it is not something a middle school student can bear.</p>
<p>In this case, if teachers can find ways to simplify their courses as much as possible, be concise and truly enable students to absorb and digest them, it can still remedy some of the problems. However, most teachers follow the rules and imitate blindly. They are not only unwilling, and disdainful of reform, but also afraid to do so.</p>
<p>For example, let's talk about Chinese again. Most teachers still cling to the remnants of the imperial examination system of selecting talents based on writing, forgetting that today's students are different from the scholars of the past. Therefore, they still adopt the cramming method, trying to stuff many old and dead words and sentences into the minds of young people. Once this is stuffed, even a genius will become feeble-minded.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the Analects, Mencius, and even Lisao and Shuowen are taught in a chaotic way. Even if it is a national language course, doesn't it include texts from both ancient and modern people? However, teachers seem to have a habit of "always praising Yao and Shun." They mostly value the ancient and despise the modern, despise vernacular and value classical Chinese. They would rather teach an abstract and empty "Record of the Pavilion Where Cranes Are Released" (at least, middle school students should think so), than talk about "Old Lady Nine Catty." They would rather teach a vague and illusory "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng" (also the view of middle school students) than read "The receding Figure," which is full of emotion and writing. It is already great if they are willing to let students read it themselves or give them a general overview.</p>
<p>When it comes to composition, students have no opportunity to say their own words. The topics are always "What and what discussion," "What and what what try to elaborate," "On what and what," etc., which make people wonder if this is the Tang or Song Dynasty. The writing must also be in classical Chinese, so the paper is full of "zhi hu zhe ye," and the beginning is "qie fu" and "chang si," which makes people wonder if this is the work of a Qing Dynasty scholar. It can be said that there is simply no opportunity to let students say what they want to say and write what they see or hear. Therefore, students' works are full of empty words and nonsense. You can't hear the current voices of current people. Isn't this intentional to make students become idiots?</p>
<p>In addition, reciting articles, remembering allusions, and writing large and small regular scripts are countless. But remember, the time for Chinese class is six hours per week. If you were the student, could you bear it?</p>
<p>If we think this system is right, then let it go. Fortunately, there are so many feeble-minded people that everyone is feeble-minded. Those who are not feeble-minded are ultimately in the minority. If you want to ridicule or satirize, just ridicule and satirize. Otherwise, we should reform and eliminate this system and the people who manufacture feeble-mindedness!</p>
<p>We do not allow the existence of manufacturers of feeble-mindedness anymore!</p>

<p>In the autumn, the vast plains collect a dream of a hundred miles, a meandering stream believes in clearness, facing the river I see a dam with a level pond, algae are dense, duckweed is deep, fish do not rise; around the pond I faintly recall the beauty of the woods, completely giving it up to clearing and leveling, what is the reason? Green and yellow cattail leaves are mixed with reed thatch, slender white water chestnut flowers are initially budding, the nature of things is truly seen, it is difficult to draw, earnest grass breeds and flourishes, the beautiful cabinet dies! The old scriptures of the Buddhist pavilion, how can one reach them, the lonely broken bridge pillows the stream water, the intention travels and desires to rest, losing the Jing House, the stumbling Shalu rocks are tooth-like. Coming here I hate that it is still too early in the autumn, I do not see the maple leaves dyed red and purple by the frost, looking from afar I am a little happy to point to the cold bamboo, a sheet of evening smoke stretches far away. On the way home I sigh, talking about Zhang (poetry boat), Gu (Qin Chang), the elders of old were elegant, stressing one's native village, the characters from the Daoxian years are far and hard to grasp, the vacant imperial court toils in vain to transcribe the old paper! (Zhang once repaired the county chronicles in the temple)</p>
<h3 id="e147">Thoughts Inspired by the Suffering of Taking a Bus <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>- Yi Jun</p>
<p>Taking the tram and public bus, the suffering of the crowding is equal to suffering a crime. Except for those who ride in small cars or exclusively ride pedicabs, no one does not admit this fact. However, what is worth studying is: although the way of taking the bus is extremely evil, crowding passengers to the point of crying out in pain and complaining endlessly, why are there still full buses of people squeezing on to be punished? Thinking about it, one suffers the crime for the sake of life.</p>
<p>The four major items in life, "clothing, food, shelter, and transportation," are all closely related to the matter of taking a bus. Taking a bus is inherently "transportation," and in order to meet the needs of "clothing, food, and shelter," one cannot sit at home and wait for bread, clothes, and houses to fall from the sky. One still has to go outside to participate in work, which requires "transportation," so one needs to take a bus.</p>
<p>People cannot be afraid of suffering in order to live, and have to endure it. For example, before I served society, I generally had a principle when taking a bus, that is, when there were too many people in the bus, I would never get on. What to do? Either walk or wait slowly. Now that I have a job, it's not possible. School starts at 8:15, and I have to rush to school before that time. Suppose I encounter a bus at 7:00, then I can't care whether it's crowded or not, whether I'll suffer or not. I can only ask the gentleman to enter the urn—get on the bus.</p>
<p>Therefore, my conclusion is: generally, people are not afraid of suffering for the sake of life.</p>
<p>Then, I thought again, since people are not afraid of suffering for the sake of life, no wonder there are so many people committing crimes in society. Knowing that committing a crime will be punished, but for the sake of clothing and food, when there is "no way to go to heaven, no door to enter the earth," one can only resort to the path of committing crimes and acting recklessly. This is what I say about the poor.</p>
<p>Then, as for the rich and noble who do not have problems with life, why do they also violate the law? My idea is that the reason is: first, "the rich are unkind." Perhaps their wealth and nobility were originally achieved through "unkind" means. They are already used to being "unkind," how can they suddenly become "kind"! Second, although life is not a problem, the enjoyment of life is limitless. The rich want to be officials, the officials want to be emperors, and the emperors want to be immortals. In order to satisfy higher-level enjoyment, they will naturally not hesitate to violate laws and regulations. Third, those who have money and power are naturally not afraid of anything! To summarize the three points, it is nothing more than for the sake of life, but this life is to enjoy as much as possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion here is: for the sake of life, they do not hesitate to commit crimes and are not afraid of punishment.</p>
<p>If we put it this way, does it mean that people who are not afraid of suffering in military service are also not afraid of suffering for committing crimes? No, no, no! The key here mainly lies in personality cultivation. Similarly, they are not afraid of suffering for the sake of life, but those who have personality cultivation are only not afraid of taking the bus; those who have no personality cultivation are not only not afraid of taking the bus, but they also do not care about "going to jail."</p>

<p>- Zhang Yongjiang</p>
<p>Old horses can recognize the way, cunning rabbits have three burrows. The wisdom of animals is sometimes quite amazing. Once an American man was passing through a desolate prairie in eastern Washington state. He approached a well and almost fell into it. The well was originally a dry well where someone wanted to dig for water but failed to do so. He was temporarily curious, so he lay down on the ground and looked into the well. He saw only darkness inside, about fifteen feet deep. About two feet down from the wellhead, there was a groove one foot deep, recessed into the well wall, spiraling around the well wall like a rifle line inside a gun barrel, leading straight to the bottom of the well. His surprised gaze followed the groove to the dark bottom of the well, where he saw a pair of dead wolves stiffly lying there.</p>
<p>What was going on, he didn't understand at first. Later, after careful speculation, he suddenly realized. It turned out that the spiral groove was not dug down from above, but up from below. After the wolves fell into the well, they couldn't jump out. They felt that the only way to save themselves was to dig a spiral groove along the well wall and climb up from the groove. Dig, fight, work hard, he unswervingly dug upward, and upward. His tens of thousands of footprints showed his labor for many hours or even many days. So, just as he was about to gain freedom, a misstep caused him to fall back down. Perhaps it was because he overestimated his ability and wanted to jump up from the end of the groove two feet below the ground, but his strength was not enough, and he fell repeatedly, suffering serious injuries and dying; perhaps it was because he was hungry for too long, and his strength was exhausted and he could not dig anymore, which led to his death; that is not known. He had engineering knowledge almost on par with humans, but his self-help plan failed. His wisdom is also worth praising.</p>

<p>If I were a person with a lot of money, I would definitely not rush to buy things, because after having a lot of money, I would not worry about firewood and rice, or worry about freezing or starving to death, but I should cultivate my superior career of mastering four languages, writing beautiful characters, and writing a hundred good poems. If I exchanged gold notes and had an extra three or five hundred yuan that was not very useful (assuming that daily life is maintained by a career), I would also definitely not buy a third-rate suit that is not good-looking to wear for others to see, or a Parker 51 that is definitely not as flavorful to write with as a Zhou Huchen sheep-hair brush, and I would have to worry about pickpockets, or ask my wife to sit in a hair salon and be electrocuted. I would only hire a French teacher with a monthly salary of only twenty yuan, pay him two or three years of tuition at once, and study my second foreign language, or buy a set of Twenty-Four Histories to understand the Chinese nation. This is saying that only I in China or Shanghai have this "idle capital." If seven seas have thousands of people who have it, then things will be done in a more beneficial and self-serving way.</p>
<p>If ten people in our alley have an extra three or five hundred to one or two hundred yuan, and they have no use for it at the moment and are afraid that it will disappear like smoke and clouds, why not take it out to repair our alley road, which is knee-deep in water during heavy rains and rugged and difficult to walk on when the weather is clear, and hire someone to sweep the ground every day? If there is still more, why not plant some trees and flowers?</p>
<p>If hundreds of people on this road have an extra three or five hundred to one or two hundred yuan, why not buy non-urgent or even useless items, but hire a nearby doctor to regularly examine our bodies and treat diseases, and if we have surplus energy, we can revive the poor and sick? Why not send some firewood, rice, oil, and salt to the teachers teaching in the small schools on this road, so that they can be more energetic when teaching and be patient and guide? Why not purchase some books and establish a small community library? Why not install a public telephone for everyone to use?</p>
<p>If we have thousands of people in this area who have three or five hundred yuan to spare and have no use for it, why not combine to run a hospital, run a school, run a nursery, or run a vocational training center for refugees?</p>
<p>If we don't do this, and we only know how to rush to buy useless things when we have a little more money in our pockets, and put them at home to collect dust, feed mice, and raise bookworms, well, one day we will attract ghosts to our door, which will be enough for you to suffer. Above "cultivating one's own moral character," you should know that there are the two words "poverty then"!</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The style of buying on consignment is prevalent everywhere, and Beijing is no exception, but it is somewhat different from other places, being relatively more moderate. One reason is that this old capital, with its thick soil and leisurely habits, has always had a calm and composed demeanor, emphasizing "anxious in heart, but not anxious on the face." Even when a major change is imminent, and one is thinking hard about how to deal with it, one will not show the restlessness as much as Shanghai does. During normal periods, the liveliness and prosperity of Beijing are not as good as Tianjin, and Tianjin is not as good as Shanghai. Therefore, the squeezing and rushing, the noisy and chaotic, the busy and disorderly periods of abnormal times will not be as "multi-蜂" and smoky. As shown in the copperplate of the cow-party sleeping on the street published in this newspaper earlier, the scene of rows and rows and lines and lines of "sardines," and the strategy of occupying land to buy "Wowo", Tianjin has been infected, but Beijing has not yet learned to walk. Queueing is all there is. Now Pingjin also spreads the name of the Cow-party, which is said to have originated from the Shanghai school. There has always been similar behavior in the north, but no such term. Whenever a run or rush buying occurs, most of those who occupy numbers and queue are not the main owners. Some people are employed everywhere, or go to the door to inquire, or wander outside the line store, or use small capital to buy ration tickets with discounts, or poor men and women take their wages to buy on behalf of others to stand in line, suffering the cold, wind and frost, in exchange for rewards. (This is called "work money", with women being the majority, because women are more likely to get the sympathy of "the person in the counter in the house", giving them priority over men.) This trend has existed since the bank runs in the early years of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Now the stores on the streets are desolate and desolate, especially the oil, salt, grain, rice, and daily necessities stores. The door is posted with "fragrant oil has been sold out", "large salt has been exhausted", soy sauce, cooking wine, and noodles, all kitchen supplies, do not say no sale, nor say out of stock, only say "sold out." Even if you rush there early in the morning, they will say: Someone came earlier than you to rush buy them. In fact, they have already moved people elsewhere, and the shelves are empty. Beijing merchants, seeing signs of a rush to buy, quickly store their goods away, and their sharp eyes and quick hands to respond to opportunities are still the usual skills of "Old Beijing." Even if an acquaintance comes to the counter to buy, they will run into a snag. (Although they are not difficult for acquaintances, they are afraid that the official plainclothes people will see them and get into trouble, so even very close acquaintances must deliver the goods to their homes at night, and not sell them as a transaction, achieving the word "black market" to the fullest.) Therefore, the trend of rush buying of daily necessities has become a thing of the past in a very short time. Now it is just a cold front door, empty shelves and quiet people. The shopkeeper and shop assistants face each other "meditating". If there are buyers who inquire, they smile and shake their heads. The buyer also smiles and reciprocates, always so lazy and humble!</p>

<h3 id="e150">Identity Card is Not Issued for a Long Time, Daily Necessities Cannot be Purchased, Hope Relevant Authorities Will Improve Quickly <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Editor: I recently read in the newspapers that citizens of this city purchase goods with their national identity cards, or issue purchase permits based on their identity cards. The method is very good, but it seems to lack perfection, because some citizens of this city have not yet received their national identity cards. Like me, I have been in Shanghai for less than two months. Although the identity card has been requested from the Bao Office to be reported for verification, I have not received it yet. In this case, we have no right to purchase daily necessities. But we cannot be without these items for a day. Regarding this point, the authorities in charge of rationing have probably considered remedies to benefit the citizens. In my opinion, before the identity card is requested but not received, the Bao Office should temporarily issue a temporary certificate, which has the same validity as the identity card. Only in this way can the rationing system be implemented smoothly and without obstacles. In addition, it is also hoped that the Civil Affairs Bureau, the District Office, the Baojia Chief, should strive for speed in terms of procedures, and do not delay for a long time before issuing them, as in the past, which is what the public expects. Zhang Zhaoqi, a civil servant in this city, reports.</p>
