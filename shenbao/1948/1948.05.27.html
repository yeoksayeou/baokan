<h3>總統府有重要集義　經濟部門決予加強　俞鴻多返京再懇辭財長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕翁文灝糾新政院，廿六日竟日與各有關方面接觸，並再謁總統請示，總統府內晨晚亦均有重要集議，副院長·各部會首長及正·副秘書長人選雖已大致決定，但因一部份尚須洽商同意，故廿六日未能公布。此間政界咸盼翁氏能以最愼重之考慮，提出能孚衆望之名單，俾新政院名實相符，成為一責任內閣，以完成戡亂行憲兩大任務。據悉：俞鴻鈞，李惟果，王寵惠，陳立夫，于斌等廿六日上午先後往訪翁氏，分別商談組閣等事宜。聞翁氏堅邀李惟果出任秘書長，李已有首肯之意。午後翁氏復訪張厲生，俞大維，俞飛鵬等。關於民·靑兩黨人士入閣事，亦續在商談中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕翁文灝出長政院後對於有關經濟部門，決將予以加强，政院原設立全經會，翁氏認為新政院成立後，仍有設立必要，依政院新組織法中第十四條規定：「行政院為處理特定事務，得於院內設各種委員會」，故全經會之繼續設立，在法規中實有其根據。聞新政院成立後，全經會即將繼續成立，並予以調整加强。該會秘書長一職，張院長時代樓桐孫辭職核准，巳改派顧毓琅代理，將來極可能由顧氏眞除。至政院副秘書長一職，顧氏呼聲亦高，故顧氏新職將為二者中之一，明令將俟新閣組成後發表。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕總統頃訓令直轄各機關，「卅六年三月卅一日公布，同年十二月廿五日修正之行政院組織法，應即自本年五月廿五日起施行」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京京六日電〕財長兼央行總裁俞鴻鈞，前赴滬接任央行總裁，廿六日晨已公畢返京，俞氏下軍後即晋謁總統及翁院長，報告滬市金融狀况及央行交接情形。記者往訪，並詢以是否願在新閣中仍任財長，俞氏表示渠對財長一職壓向當局懇辭，現新閣成立，自應另易新人，以興新政，且精力亦深感不勝，故決無意繼續，已再向當局切實表示辭意。另悉財部易畏巳經確定，俞氏返京後，巳飭所屬準備辦理移交，財部主任秘書渠敬錞並於廿六日發出通知，定廿八日晨九時邀集各單位負責人舉行會議，商討辦理移交事宜。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關係方面消息，張嘉璈辭夫行總裁職後，無意任新閣中之財長，而將實際主持美援之運用事宜。財長一席，以顧翊羣担任之可能性較大。</p>
<h3>憲政督導委會組織規程頒布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕蔣總統廿六日頒布命令如左：　茲制定憲政督導委員會組織規程公布之。，此令。</p>
<p>憲政督導委員會組織規程</p>
<p>第一條　本規程依據第一屆國民大會第一次會議決議制定之。</p>
<p>第二條　本會委員，由政府就第一屆國民大會代表自由參加者聘任之。</p>
<p>第三條　本會之任務如左：</p>
<p>（一）關於憲法之研討事項</p>
<p>（二）關於實施憲政之建議事項</p>
<p>（三）關於實施憲政之考察調查事項</p>
<p>（四）關於實施憲政之宣傳事項</p>
<p>（五）關於政府委託有關實施憲</p>
<p>政之督導及審議事項</p>
<p>第四條　本會設會長一人，副會長二人至四人，由政府聘任之，會長主持本會會務，副會長協助之。</p>
<p>第五條　本曾會長於本會會議時為主席，會長不克出席時，由副會長互推一人代理之。</p>
<p>第六條　本會設研究·考察·宣傳三委員會，凡本會委員得自由認定參加，但每人以參加一個委員會為限。</p>
<p>每一委員會設召集人三人至五人，由會長就參加委員中指定之，於會議時互推一人為主席。</p>
<p>第七條　本會事務，由國民大會秘書處承會長·副會長之命兼辦之。</p>
<p>第八絛　本規程自公布之日施行。</p>
<h3>憲督會六一成立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕憲政督導委會籌備委會，廿六日下午三時半開第三次會，討論該會組織規程，並決定於六月一日成立。今日會議出席委員達二百餘人，李鴻儒主席，討論組織規程時，發言者極為踴躍，該會原曾起草組織規程兩案，尚未決定，而廿六日總統府公布該會組織規程，與該會　擬者頗有出入，廣泛討論時，若干委員認爲該會爲代表自組之機構，非屬於政府之機稱，府令公布者，則係由政府聘任會長·副會長，而該組織規程且未經立法程序，亦不合法，因此一部委員認為不必以府令公布之組織規程為依據，另行推定委員，審查該會自擬之草案，當獲多數同意通過，至下午五時始散。</p>
<h3>總統頒布命令修正預決算法</h3>
<p>〔又電〕總統廿六日頒布命令如下：（一）茲修正預算法公布之，此令。（二）茲修正決算法公布之，此令。（三）茲修正會計法第十六條，第廿二條，第卅五條，第九十條，第一百十九條，第一百廿三條，第一百廿四絛，第一百廿五條條文公布之，此令。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕主計部組織法，今經總統以命令公布施行。</p>
<h3>政院新聞局長　董顯光將蟬聯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕行政院新聞局長一職，將由董顯光蟬聯，殆已確定。董氏巳隨張羣政院總辭職時辭職，翁文　正商洽挽留中，惟尚未確定。廿六日新聞局記者招待會，仍於下午三時半舉行，但董氏以業已辭職，且值政院新舊交替不易「發言」關係，故未出席，僅由軍事發言人鄧文儀報告一週戰况後即行散會。</p>
<h3>監委明日起報到　會期預定為兩週</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕行憲第一屆監察院六月五日集會，監委報到定廿八日開始。此次會期約兩週，討論之議題較立院簡單，初步工作為互選院長，副院長，並議訂會議規則。此次集會籌備費預算核定為三四〇億元，招待處已備妥，各地監委抵京報到後，即可獲得招待。會塲現設勵志社，同時在立院舊址增建禮堂，俟完工後，即行遷入。關于院長問題，于右任迄目前為止，尚未表示將出而競選，但在京之監委六十餘人，巳有絕大多數表示擁護于氏出任首屆院長。</p>
<h3>立院特種審查會討論各委會問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕立法院特種審查委會，廿六日上下午開會，程天放主席，討論第四次院會交議該院組織法中有有關各種委會之問題，決議六點：（一）各委員會不設固定召集人，（二）每一委員以在其參加之第一志願委會中任召集人為限。（三）每一委員會召集人之輪值次序，以一次抽簽全部決定之。（四）陳顧遠提案中，召集委員五人按月處理會務之規定，無必要，委員會事務由秘書人員負責。（五）每一委員可參加三個委員會之規定，仍維組織法原文。額，但對人數多少之意見不一，計有一九九，一五〇，九九，九〇，八〇五種主張，均未獲通過，將併提院會決定，至委員會之種類及總數，則將於廿七日會中討論。</p>
<h3>張羣由渝飛抵蓉　醫治牙疾後即返首都辦理交代　否認將出任渝綏靖主任</h3>
<p>〔本報成都廿六日電〕張羣廿六日午後五時偕渝市長楊森飛抵蓉，王陵基，劉文輝等在機塲歡迎。張氏據稱：離鄉年餘，川政有長足進展，極表欣慰，來蓉僅留三日即返京，辦理交代。渠對今後出處，避不作答，惟對翁文　組新閣，深</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿六日電〕張羣廿六日下午四時偕楊森，何北衡等飛蓉。張臨行稱：翁文灝出長政院，對今後幣制穩定及物價平衡有助美援成功，除大部作為剿匪用途外，餘四億美金如善於配合應用，可達三目的：（一）充實糧食，汽油，棉花等物資，可穩定物價，（二）减少外匯支出，可使收支平衡，（三）物資轉成法幣，可助財政預算平衡。張氏又稱：整理幣制，一時難實行。此次赴蓉，將赴華大醫學院醫治牙疾，外傳參加川·康·渝首長會議，殊無加以否認必要，渠已卸任重靑，行憲時期，個人行動大可不必揣測。</p>
<p>〔中央社成都廿六日電〕張羣抵蓉談：外傳本人將出任重慶綏靖主任說，純屬子虛。</p>

<p>美經濟合作局執行長官駐華代表萊普漢，可望於六月四日自舊金山西飛七日抵上海，正式開始執行援華計劃。與萊氏偕行者尚有八人，內有鐵路採礦與動力專家數名。據悉：萊氏抵華後，其總辦事處將設上海，另在南京設一辦事處，與我政府保持密切聯繫。萊氏今日單獨接兌中央社記者稱，現行援華計劃預定進行至一九四九平四月三日完成，屆時即須向美國會提出關於三億三千八百萬美元經濟復原用費之詳細報告。聞參與萊普漢代表團之各專家，將勘察我國煤礦與粵瑛鐵路，此種工作恐需時數載，始克完成，將超出現行援華法案之時限。　萊氏之駐華機構尚未組織完成，但美駐華救濟團團長吉爾伯所屬人員若干人有被延攬參加萊氏新機構之可能。萊氏之駐華時期未定，但渠將逕向經濟合作局執行長官霍夫曼提出報告。萊氏宣稱，援華計劃之主要任務企於增加生產，並在中國內地分配美援物資，使最大多數人民能得實惠。按萊氏曾任舊金山市長，於一九三七年　溝橋事變前五日曾初度到北平，去年復與美國官員暨各報記者等一行，作環球飛行旅行時，在上海略作逗留。萊氏鬢髪巳白，過去數日來渠曾屢與霍夫曼，國務院及衆院撥款委員會人員有所商談，現復在探索專家關於中國問題之見解。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕商務部次長福斯特今日在參院撥款委員會宣稱，經濟合作局應削减中國在美購棉要求。福氏稱，該署原擬為中國購買五百萬元物資，大部份係棉花與米，但中國要求定購大批美棉，合作局方面如果拒絕付賬，中國可利用其現有美金繳款，要求其他方式之援助。萊普漢對報界稱</p>
<h3>五大市配糧　擬繼續辦理　萊普漢對報界稱</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕經濟合作局駐華代表萊晉漢今日宣佈：經濟合作局擬繼續在中國五大沿海城市進行糧食全面配售計劃。渠告新聞記者稱：「吾人之意，擬在六月底以後仍繼續此項配售計劃，如能獲得必要之基金，並有擴及其他城市之可能。」</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>以色列的厄運！</h3>
<p>自英國宣佈結束統治及新猶太國鼴生之後，巴勒斯坦的猶阿衝突，也就演變為大規模的戰爭了。阿刺伯軍在回教聯盟各國的合力支持之下，結集了十萬天軍，向猶太軍猛攻，現巳兵臨以色列國京城下，假如沒有外來因素的滲入，則阿軍迫令誕生來　半月的以色列國訂城下之盟，猶太人恐將無力拒絕；同時聖地的糜爛，也是不可避免的了。</p>
<p>惟以色列國當局鑒於聖地局勢的危急，深知靜待聯合國安全理事會援用憲章中最有效的條文，以制猶　雙方的戰爭，殆巳「緩」不濟「急」，遠水救不得近火，因此早就向安全理事會發出緊急迫切的呼籲，要求聯合國大會立即頒佈停戰令，强令猶阿雙方先行停戰。聯大雖巳向猶阿雙方頒佈停戰令，且限於二十四日正午之前實行停戰，但是阿刺伯軍的攻勢迄未稍緩，並由阿刺伯聯盟要求安全理事會將停戰令延長四十八小時，以便決定最後熊度。因有英國的支援，阿刺伯聯盟的要求乃為安全理事會所接受，於是停戰令的期限延至廿六日正午為止。在此期間，美國政府既訓令其駐在阿刺伯各國的使節，設法使其駐在各國的政府接受聯大所頒佈的停戰令，英國外相貝文亦以强硬牒文，送達阿刺伯聯盟各國，勸其接受聯大的停戰令、可是阿刺伯各國代表商議再三，迄今尚未有改變態度的跡象，而沙地阿刺伯政府却巳首先率直表示，拒絕安全理事會的要求下令停戰了。所以我們綜合各方面的報道，可知阿刺伯各國接受聯大的停戰令，可能性是非常少的；換句話說，以色列國誕生未久即遭浩劫，似屬不可避免的了。</p>
<p>但是美國對於巴勒斯坦問題，向來生張猶阿分治的，且曾在暗中扶植猶太人的復國來運動，最近雖一　改鑲態度，主張將巴勒斯坦交付聯合國託管，但到以色列國　生之很，美國就搶先予以事實上的承認，表示美國依舊支撐猶太國，從此，以色列國業叭有依賴聯合國機構和美國的援助。聯合國機構雖欲援用憲章中最有效力的條款，立即制止聖地的戰爭，但因英　意見的分歧，安全理事會迄未通過任何決議，致使聯合國安全理事會的軟弱無能，暴露無遺，同時也使猶太人大失所望，不得不將其希望完全移向美國。所以以色列國臨時總統　士曼特地到華府去向杜魯門總統乞援，杜魯門總統　了維慶美國在國際上的地位起見，同時也為了爭取國內猶太人的擁護起見，對於以色列國的危急，自然也只有「授手援溺」了。預料美國援助猶太國的途徑，不外乎下列兩項：（一）接濟軍火，據華府消息，杜魯門總統承認開放運送軍火至以色列國之禁令巳屬刻不容緩之事；（二）經濟援助，亦據華府透露消息，魏士曼要求華國貸款一億美元，杜魯門總統巳允予以老慮。</p>
<p>美國照這樣幹下去，與阿刺伯聯盟各國的關係，勢將每况愈下，叙利亞和埃及兩回教國，為阻攔美國的接濟到達以色列國計，巳宣佈封鎖巴勒斯坦海岸，並將駛往巴勒斯坦美輪中之美國人民四十一人加以逮捕。這些行為，在理論上，雖然違背國際公法，美國當局也一再向阿刺伯各國抗議，但是在事實上，猶阿戰爭若不能停止，那末這些問題都是無法解決的。</p>
<p>我們對於巴勒斯坦問題，一直抱上客觀的看法，而認為是　　　教和民族分歧的問題·猶阿實分治，站在宗教和民族的立塲，絕無反對的理由，所以在以色列國鼴生之後，列强各國相繼予以承認，其原因也就在此。不過從另一角度去觀察，巴勒斯坦不能與印度相提並論，地理的條件與經濟的因素，決定了巴勒斯坦不宜分割為兩個獨立國家，假如勉强實行分　，割裂而爲兩個國家，那末這兩個國家都沒有具備現代國家應有的條件。在這種塲合，阿刺怕人的誓死反對猶太國的存在，並不是完全沒有理由的。所以巴勒斯坦問題的本身，就是一個錯綜　雜的問題，何况在巴勒斯坦問題中還要滲雜上外來的因素，成為强權政治鬥爭的塲所，故巴勒斯坦問題成爲世人最困惱的問題了。</p>
<p>過去英　統治巴勒斯坦，採取「分而治之」的政策，不僅不法調處雙方的衝突，使其和平相處，反二庶利戀情　阿　　的予盾，故八依　從而自處於舉足輕重的地位。巴勒斯坦間題遷　三十餘年遙未解決，英國的對巴勒斯坦政策，不能不多少負些責任。最近英週　　　宣佈結束統治聖地，但在暗　仍扶植阿剌伯人，不僅在幕後指揮阿剌伯聯盟，而且明目張膽地援助阿剌伯軍，英國軍官在阿剌伯軍中充任指揮官者不下四五十人，而阿剌伯軍所用的軍火，大半也是英國所供給的。所以強權政治的縱權　闔，不特有蘇　聖地的明爭暗鬥，愈演愈烈，就是在英美之間，也發生了衝突。又因美國的舉棋不定，沒有一貫的政策，以致造成今日聖地可悲的局勢。這可謂猶阿雙方的不幸，亦可謂列强自食其惡果。</p>
<p>要之，巴勒斯坦的猶阿衝突，已成為今日最感困惱的國際問題了，其唯一的解決途徑，只有列强大家退出聖地，聽由猶阿直接談判，和平解決雙方之間的一切分歧。　爾，即使久懸不決，也許不致演變為最感困惱的國際問題。</p>
<h3>我簽署關稅貿易協定輕工衣不受影響</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕我國代表簽署關稅貿易協定後，外界頗以影嚮本國工商業為慮。記者廿六日向財部探詢該協定對於我國之影響，據該部發言人稱：上項協定，係卅六年在日內瓦世界貿易暨就業會議第二屆準備會議所協定，參加會議之國家計有中。英·美·加·法·澳·荷·印等十八國，各本互惠精神協議，相互减低進口關稅，以促進雙方貿易為鵠的，惟我國為工業落後國家，本部為維護國內幼　工業，對於减稅一點，曾經會同經濟·外交各部於議定書簽署以前縝密老慮，且經訓令赴會代表再加折衝，現時减讓範圍至為有限，在我進口稅則項目六七〇號列內受拘束者，僅一八八號列，不及全部稅則號列三分之一，而其中維持原稅率者一二九項（內八十項係涉及全部，四十九項涉及一部份）。减稅者僅四十六項（內三十六項係涉及全部，十項則涉及一部份）。又同一稅則號列一部份維持原稅率，一部份减稅者十三項，決非如外界所傳全部减稅。就稅率减低確數言，最高者减百分之十，最低者减百分之二。就貨品種類言，减讓號列最多者為金屬及其製品如汽車·卡車·機器·工具·曳引機·飛機等，計有五十九號列，對於我輕工業並無影饗。次為食品及飲料，如　·麵粉等計有卅八號列，再次為化學產品及染料，計有廿九號列，皆為國內所需要者，至於我與各國相互讓步之程度，可就貨值作一比較，以民國廿五年（戰前正常貿易標準）海關貿易統計推算，我國對各國讓步之貨物總值，約為國幣二億五千萬元，各國對我讓步之貨物總值，則達國幣三億二千萬元，而以美國讓步為最多，其主要項目有大豆，豆汕，花生油，豬鬃，桐油，錫銻，蠶繭，生絲，土絲，駝毛，花邊，刺繡，地毯，樟腦，磁器，帽及帽鞭，蔴類，蛋品及部份棉織品，均我國之重要轍出物，故該協定對我實利多害少。又上項减稅僅適用訂有最惠國條款之國家，並非對於任何國家進口之貨品均可享受减稅利益，目下我國進口貨物仍在外匯限額分配管制之下，前列减税進口貨物，並不因减稅而得自由輸入，故我工業界目前實仍享有限制進口之保護辦法，殊不必以履行關稅貿易協定而多顧慮。</p>

<p>十萬人響應總罷工　芬蘭動亂趨擴大　總統考慮局部改組內閣　　〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：海爾辛基訊，芬總統巴錫基維改組內閣，以謀解決因共黨所發動之罷工而引起之危機。巴氏巳任命基爾畢（屬于共黨控制之人民民主聯合陣綫）為內政部長以繼萊諾，海爾傑斯已被任命爲教育部長，萊諾之妻亦即芬籣共黨之眞正領袖，則被任命爲社會部副部長。負責方面謂，因萊諾事件而引起之罷工，將立即停止。　　〔路透社海爾辛基廿六日電〕人民民主黨行動委員會宣布，芬京一地今日響應人民民主黨所號召以迫使政府任命該黨人員祖任內長及外次兩職之總罷工者逾十萬人，至今日午刻為止，動亂擴大不巳，交通工人紛紛怠工，運輸有陷入停頓之虞。獨立中立的意見，巳開始以芬蘭之現狀與今年二月間捷克之危機相比喻。巴錫基維總統昨召集閣議，討論繼任內長之人選，但未成立協議。總統擬以內長一職畀教育部長基爾畢或總理貝卡拉，兩人均已拒絕。基爾畢原已繼萊諾担任內長，後因人民民主黨發動抗議之工潮，基氏遂亦辭去不幹。昨夜海爾辛基發生罷工之工廠有八十六家，吐爾戈港有七十一家，拉蒂有卅家，坦貝爾有十家。人民民主黨行動委員會並曰芬京電力廠工人亦擬響應罷工，已經該會勸阻。該會復曰，在內閣問題未解決以前，工人必須自知警戒，以免共黨遭受戰前相似的歧視，但罷工必須遵守紀律，所有挑撥舉動須予壓制，必要時得請當局協助。又勞工部反社會民主黨官員亦承認罷工行動已在全國各地逐漸擴大。　　〔路透社海爾辛基廿六日電〕巴錫基維總統頃下令乘坐飛快車之武裝警察，保護不願響應罷工之工人。各政府機關亦均由武裝警察駐守，同時芬內閣定今日下午再開會議，以覓取內政部長之適當人選。　　〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕此間觀察家今日以芬籣目前之局勢，與二月間捷克政變時之局勢相比較，但指出芬蘭反共勢力較捷克為强。在芬蘭各工會中佔多數之社民黨已決議尺對共黨之罷工行動。芬蘭局勢最嚴重之一方面，並非共黨所提出之要求，而為彼等提出時之態度與使用之方法。共黨之組織「行動委員會」，使人憶及捷克當時之情形。赫爾新基之共黨顯然岡在大選削弱彼等力量之前，以「普遍民主」之方式攫取大權。阿堅持取消猶國　對停戰建議昨提出答覆　耶城已展開最慘烈血戰　　〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播：成功湖訊，阿拉伯方面對安理曾停戰建議之答擾，業已抵達，內容尚未公佈。據悉，阿方對停戰建議可予接受，惟有三項條件：（一）收回對以色列國之一切承認；（二）猶人停止武，（三）限制猶人移入聖地。上述三點，對猶方均屬無法接受者。　　〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播：成功湖訊，阿拉伯方面堅持猶太國必須取消，猶太軍必須解散，因此猶太方面認為對於服從安理會停戰令亦必重行考慮，換言之，即聖地之戰將繼續進行。　　〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播：台拉維夫訊，聖城自昨日黎明起發生殺激烈戰鬥，猶阿雙方傾全力作戰，阿方猛攻，惟遭猶方擊退，戰鬥結果如何，猶在未定之天。　　〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕開羅權威方面息，埃及業已照會安理會，聲明埃王法魯克業已決定拒絕安理會巴勒斯坦休戰建議，其他阿拉伯國傳來報告，顯示各阿拉伯國均巳決定採取同一行動。埃及之拒絕係以埃軍之開入巴勒斯坦，係為恢復和平及秩序，以維人道原則為理由。據開羅埃及官方人士表示，阿拉伯之拒絕休戰，係一致行動，埃及並非單獨行動。另據阿曼來電：阿拉伯國領袖今晨再度在阿勃杜拉宮中集會，至午刻可望結束。阿拉伯聯盟諸國對安理會休戰建議的共同答覆，屆時即可以公報發表。　　〔合衆社台拉維夫邪惡六日電〕台拉維夫廿六日接獲報告，耶路撤冷城內阿猶兩軍已將全部軍隊擲入戰鬥。聖城歷史二千年來最慘烈之血戰，刻正在基督教之古老遺址間瘋狂展開。大戰於廿五日黎明開始，阿軍自耶路撤冷之南北兩面進攻大馬色門及雷却墓，戰爭至廿五日晚已達最高峯。哈迦那發言人稱，耶路撤冷區之停戰，因阿軍於截止期後進攻舊城而失效，非以色列政府下令，不能重新推行。雷却墓於埃及軍猛　該城後，已於廿五日晚被阿軍攻陷。各路阿軍俱佔上風　　〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕過去廿四小時內，聖地傳來之報告，顯示阿拉伯方面之愉快及猶太方面之悲觀。耶路撒冷舊城及新市區之猶軍已分別陷入阿拉伯軍之包圍。英國廣播公司耶城來電謂，舊城內之猶太軍已被阿拉伯軍逐入一猶太大教堂內，在該處懸起以色列族準備戰至最後一人。阿拉伯軍巳通知國際紅十字會代表，告以猶太教堂內之猶人如不投降，則阿拉伯軍將以砲火夷該堂爲平地·又向耶城新市區　進攻之阿拉伯軍亦有進展。阿拉伯軍並謂，阿軍在耶城—台拉雜夫公路上續獲大捷。猶軍巳無法　援彼圖耶路撒冷之伙伴。阿拉伯飛機並初次出動轟炸耶城新市區之猶太軍，外約但軍團在耶城迤西公路上之拉特朗，與猶車激戰廿四小時，擊斃猶人六百名之多。巴勒斯坦南綫之埃及車復佔領馬目台爾東南六豐之埃　蘇　，因此切斷猶軍與聖地　部猶太區之交通綫。黎同意放　所扣美籍猶人　　惟彼等必須直　返美　　〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕國務院廿五日宣佈，黎巴　巳同意釋放在開赴巴勒斯坦之美輪上所逮捕之美國人民四十一人，但彼等必須直接返美。國務　　言人對此項提議未表示意見，但稱，駐黎美公使品克敦正在徵求被捕美人之意見中。馬歇爾與奧斯汀等磋商　美對聖地新步驟　英對聖地局勢將發表詳細聲明　　〔中央社成功湖廿五日電〕美國務　本日午在該國出席聯合國首席代表奧斯汀在紐約之寓所內，與奧斯汀共進午餐。傳彼等曾討論美對巴勒斯坦問題之新步驟。聯合國秘書長賴伊及安理會主席巴洛第亦為座上客。　　官方雖稱，此次午餐純屬普通應酬，但一般推測，馬歇爾及賴伊等至少曾利用此機會就巴勒斯坦問題非正式交換意見。馬歇爾及奧斯汀諒亦曾秘密議定阿拉伯人倘不遵守自廿六日正午起生效之停火令，美國在安理會中所應採取之步驟。安理會之停火令期限雖已延長四十八小時，使阿拉伯國家得有時間磋商，但此間觀察家對於阿拉伯人完全聽命於安理會之希望大部認為點淡。此間阿方發言人本日表示，阿拉伯人將不同意無條件停戰後，此種瞻望更見黯淡。如阿拉伯人所要求之條件包括前所堅持之解散以色列國一端，則安理會對阿猶發出之最後和平呼籲，可能毫無作用，而安理會勢須重新努力也。　　〔合衆社倫敦廿五日電〕英外相貝文七五日告下院稱，渠將於廿六日對英國軍官在阿拉伯軍隊中之地位發表聲明。貝文並允在稍後對巴勒斯坦情勢發表詳細聲明。反對黨領袖邱吉爾囑貝文切記雜持中立之重要性，貝文答以「余巳做到此點，對此頗為了解。」　　〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕據外交界可靠方面廿五日告本社稱，巴勒斯坦阿猶雙方如不宣佈停戰，英國殆將準備讓聯合國廢止英外（外約但）協定。　　〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕在外約但軍團中供職之英國軍官，其地位始終在倫敦可信檢論之中。此等軍官人數共四十名，包括阿拉伯軍團司令格洛勃準將在內。關係方而相信，英政府就此事之議決，當隨阿拉伯國之拒絕接受安理會之停戰令而決定。英外交部發言人聲明，英國將自行決定其巴勒斯坦政策，不受任何他國之子涉，目前亦無與他國就此事之談判在進行中。蘇與以色列將交換使節　　〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕莫斯科電臺今日廣播稱蘇聯外長莫洛托夫接受以色列外長薛托克提議，決與該國交換使節。美向埃敘抗議對鎖聖地海岸　　〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國今向埃及叙利亞兩國，抗議其封鎖巴勒斯坦海上交通。國務院於聲明中指出巴勒斯坦之騙爭，並未宣戰。嵌星黑寶玉　重逾七百克拉　　〔聯合社洛山礦廿大日電〕世界最大嵌星黑寶玉，價值美金卅萬元，在此琢磨究成，巳送往紐約陳列·此玉名「坤思蘭黑星」，原來重量爲一千一百五十六克拉，磨成後重七百卅三克拉。該寶玉之主人卡才琴於數月前得之於澳洲坤思蘭礦穴中，費多日之力　心琢磨，使寶石之星恰曆中心。荷比盧外長會議　下月初重開　　商討經濟合作新步驟　　〔法國新聞社白魯塞爾廿六日電〕由於比內閣危機而延期之荷比盧三國外長會議，將於六月七八兩日在比科時亞鄧納占堡重開。據觀察家稱，三國外長屆時可能考慮十三國經濟完全結合之新步驟。日反對黨組織倒閣統一陣綫　　〔中央社東京廿六日電〕具有「保守性」之日民主自由黨，正致力於議會中與諸反對黨結合，企圖推翻蘆田內閣。該黨乃諸反對黨之巨擘，在衆院中占有一五一席。聞第一議員俱樂部社會革新黨與農民黨中，巳有若干人同意加入反規政府之結合。民主自由黨此舉之另一目的，亦在自政府黨之民黨及國民協同黨內，吸收若干政見與各該黨不同之人士。聞反對黨之聯合陣綫，刻擬於辦論衆議紛紜之預算案時，對現政府展開攻勢。美國明年可望實施　軍事援歐計劃　全部需款約六下億元　　〔　細社羣　頓廿五日電〕民主黨參議員喬治今日向記者預示，國會於明年將被論通過供紛西歐國家以軍備的馬歇爾討州，以助其遇阻共產主義的威脅，全部費用在三十億至六十億元之間。喬治聲稱，「此事難尚須視何人當選總統，及新總統之　以何種速度推行此事而定其實施之暹早。然余確信在明年以內，國會必將　請通過武裝西歐的法案。」渠又曰，美陣　請改良英國之海軍，並增强其空軍力量。法國之軍事配備甚感缺乏，勢必重新澈底裝配。渠相信參院如能通過范登堡之區城防務決議案，西歐國家即不難獲得區城防務制度下所需的武裝。西歐聯盟五國協商聖地局勢　英反對美對以色列貸欵　　〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播；華盛頓訊，白宮新聞秘書羅斯今日告記者謂，美國對近東解除軍火禁運令事，不擬「立即採取行動」。關於美國對以色列國貸款一節，不願多加討論。　　〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕英外部發言人今日稱，渠認杜魯門總統之向以色列總統魏資曼允諾對以色列貸款，殊屬不及時。英政府對於足以鼓勵阿拉伯國拒絕接受休戰之任何建議，均不表贊成。發言人並透露，西歐聯盟五國正就巴勒斯坦問題協商，五國外交政策之互相聯絡固西歐聯盟之原則。三強派聯絡官駐警察總部　蘇物品取威脅態度　柏林危機又有復活趨勢力　　〔路透社柏林廿五日電〕柏林區蘇軍副司令葉利蕯洛夫上校，今日採取被視為威脅性的態度，向英美法三軍政府抗議派遣聯絡官駐在柏林蘇聯區之警察總部。葉上校在柏林副司令之會議中聲稱，此等聯絡官並未獲得任何特許，擅自駐在蘇聯區之警察總局，蘇聯當局或將不得不採取必要的措施，以終止因比而產生的反常局勢，此乃破壞柏林區內和平與秩序的行為。副司令會議之主席英代表班生準將，乃表示蘇聯當局如恐嚇英代表，意欲阻止其進入四强共管的任何機構，乃極嚴重之事態。渠詢葉利蕯洛夫以擬採種措施。葉氏表示余已發表之意見外，不擬作其他表示。觀察家相信沉寂已久之所謂柏林危機，又有復活之勢。俟倫敦六國會議之結果趨於明朗後，各西方國家已獲成立西德政府之協議，則蘇聯之將迫使西方盟國退出柏林，殆為必然之事。美援歐復興方案　款項的分配　　購糧食及物資各佔其半　　〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕歐洲經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼頃告參院撥款委會稱，歐洲復興方案下第一年內之全部　款，用以購買救濟物品及經濟復興所需物資者，約各佔一半。在總額五十三億元中，購　糧食及農產品者約廿四億七千二百萬元，購買復興物資浙約廿七億五千萬元，其餘之七千八百萬元，作為管理及其他雜費。霍夫曼並允諾不久将久將向撥款委會提出報告，以示英國會否以經濟合作總署下之資金，資助巴勒斯坦之阿拉伯人。蘇與印尼同意互派外交代表　　〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿六日電〕據今日此間消息：蘇與印尼現已同意互相派遣外交代表及領事，該項談判係　蘇駐捷大使與駐捷印尼公使在捷京舉行。南非陛邦　舉行普選　　〔路透就約翰奈斯堡廿六日電〕南非聯邦定今日舉行普選，一般僉認此乃南非史上最重要的普選。眞色攝影　法人發明新法　　影業將起一大革命　　〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕法國工程師渥氏兄弟二人研究眞色攝影，歷時達十七年之久，現已發明絕對與眞實色彩相似之攝影方法，耗費且較以前任何方法為便宜。此項新攝影方法僅須設一特製之　頭，其他設備均與黑白攝影相同，膠片亦與普通所用者同。法國製片家巴育爾稱，渠下次拍攝一麵粉西施」一片，即將採用此種新方法。渠論及此種新發明稱，此將使電影界完新的革命，此後二年內黑白影片將完全消滅，四十歲之徐娘亦不能再演二十歲少女之角色矣。美參院外委會援華報告（二）　　國務院所建議的計劃　　在現行情形下，欲求根據來自美國之外援，而為中國之經濟復興擬定一切實有效之長期統盤計劃，實屬困難。吾人必須視事態之發展而逐步加以處理，猶如在一切對外援助計劃中然。吾人必須明白表示一點，即吾人之義務，以本法案之各

<h3>指定銀行結匯數字增加出口貿易漸有起色</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會消息：本月份一至二十二日，僅上海一地　指定銀行結匯出口者巳約達九百二十萬美元。天津靑島台灣廣州等外埠結匯數字尚朱包括在內。其中如鮮蛋水果冰蛋及蛋製品，適值旺季，為數較多，合計二百六十萬美元。紗及針織品合計一百萬美元，茶葉共九十萬美元，皮貨猪鬆紡織品合計五十萬美元，故本月份出口結匯總數，超過四月份可無問題。如最近兩週內有良好因素，則可能打破以前各月結匯數字之紀錄云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕輸管會霍主委寶封，已於日前提出辭呈，略謂接任以來少有建樹，故請另選賢能，當時未有核覆。一般推測此事需於組閣完成，貿易及外匯政策決定之後，方能討論輸管會之改組事宜。</p>

<h3>日賠機器陸續運到處理價配尚無眉目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部接收價配民營工廠之日本賠償機器，自本年一月廿二日，由海康輪運到首批後，迄目前為止，陸續已有海浙·永興·　州·利民·昌黎·海吉·海宿等輪，先後分十批運來。到埠大小機器，刻共有一四四六件。預計本年六月底前，尚有四批可到。則第一批之接收工作，即可告一段落。外界以工廠申請價配之登記期限，早於本年四月十五日截止，而處理辦法，迄今仍無眉目。而機器擱置過久，銹爛堪虞。記者昨向經部工商輔導處主管部門探詢詳情。據悉：此批機器，裝箱情形良好。木箱裏層，襯有柏油紙板，機器表面亦塗有牛油。笨重機器，堆罷露天，上蓋油布，下墊枕木，以遮風雨。該項防水設備，大致可維持六個月。惟有若干機器，在日待運時，亦不無躭擱。今如堆置日期過久，難保不有銹爛情事。惟輔導處以囿於經費，對堆棧·搬運·裝卸各費，巳感左支右絀。果有銹燜情事，亦屬無能為力。所幸前次招待各界參觀時，曾拆開機器廿箱，均無銹爛。故推想即有銑爛，當佔極少數。一方面經部處理日本賠償委負會，亦正趕辦審核事宜中。蓋第一批機器總共不過一六〇一部，而各廠申請價配者，竟超過萬部以上審核費時。惟預計在下月中，當有結果，以便陸續價配處理云。</p>

<h3>東華發揮威力大破英海軍五比一貢軍慘敗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東華足球隊昨日發揮高超强大之威力，以五比一大勝貢軍隊，英艦倫敦號與路覺號之聯隊，上牛時東華以四比一佔極對優勢。　　震爲英海軍第一戰之成績，昨日逸園相當擁擠，約計五千餘人。裁判李國義，巡邊樂秀熒王重業。</p>
<p>東華精彩東華踢來相當努力，頗有精彩，守門陳惠民搶救險球，勇而敏捷，可造之材。因東華後衛之堅强，遂使英軍前鋒，活動力大為减少。中衛綫　尼波攻守俱佳，前鋒陳明哲韓龍海李垚攻射之猛烈，為東華多日未見之表演。英海軍因忙於守，前鋒攻力頓減，而全綫凌亂，始終未見有佳美之聯絡，較前日大為減色，中堅薛格思之外，鮮有可取者。</p>
<p>各一平手東華先攻，混戰約十分鐘，英軍中堅薛格思，手觸皮球，老孫主罰十二碼，刀下留情，一射偏出。未幾，幼良深入，毛世曼逼成角球，幼良開來，落點甚佳李垚門前候個正上，頂上開花，先斬一關。英軍反攻，葛利芬單騎劫營，陳惠民衝出，葛舉足拉射，中陳足部彈出。福特帶球進攻，傳交中路，夏特奇低射入網，一比一扳成和局。</p>
<p>連中三元東華再取攻勢，陳明哲帶球疾趨，梅泰世攔截不愼，傷及足踝，由林曼思入代。廿五分幼良傳　尼波，於廿五碼外施放冷箭，應聲入網，又陷一城。英兵禍不單行，兩分鐘後，明哲得球，　傳幼良，賈挑與阿孫，一個擺渡，李垚於底綫處力叩入關，成三對一。半點鐘時龍海如脫韁之馬，中路搗入，上半時四比一東華佔絕對優勢。</p>
<p>龍海吊毛</p>
<p>休息後，張林根於洽興下野，莊友仁金川瀚登塲。英軍形勢，較前穩定，反攻甚力，奈射法欠準，枉費心機。直至廿八分，幼良於邊關起義，妙傳中路，龍海一個反身吊毛，將球勾入網中，成五比一，東華氣走英海軍。英海軍本預約交大等友賽，因今日急須離滬駛台，故作罷論。</p>

<h3>從思想改造到政治革新讀「思想·道德·政治」　胡秋原著新中國出版社版</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>八年抗戰，只博得動花一現的勝利。勝利後的景象，是內亂，是破壞，和期　完全相反，使許多人感到十分地苦悶，還有人發表了許多改進的意見。在這許多辦法中，眞是形形式式，五花八門。胡秋原先生主張從思想方面，道德方面，引上到政治革新的路，確是一個精闢獨特的見解。</p>
<p>胡先生最近將他的二十九篇論文，集成一册，題為一思想·道德·政治」，就是代表他的主張。全書分成三個單元，論思想的，有八篇，論道德的有七篇，餘十四篇是論政治的。各篇可以獨立地分開來讀，但從全書來看，仍有一貫的系統，絕沒有前後不相呼應之處。</p>
<p>關於思想方面，作者是主張自由的，所以他將思想與自由作開端，而以新自由主義為結束。其同他諭述中國思想和西洋思想之同異，特點，及近百年來中國思想受西洋思想影嚮以後的演變，並指巴其矛盾之處。作者認為思想是一切行為的原動力，思想的改造，也是一切改革的基礎。理性的自由的思想，才能恢復我們淸明的智慧。新自由主義就是思想改革之途徑。胡氏的新自由主義，是將運動·進化·創造三者合而為一，從歷史的演變，自然界的活動，而發揮本來的性能；久這本來的性能，是至善的，合理的，而無傷他人他物的。人類本來性能若能充分發揮，社會即可得趨進步，世界乃可至於和平。</p>
<p>從自由思想，提出了「己立立人，已達達人」的新道德信條，就是作者所論的道德的中心。思想是個人的，道德是社會的。今天的中國，舊道德趨於淪亡，而新道德的樑準，尚未建立，以致造成今日紊亂的現象。本來道德是不分新舊的，只要恢復道德的價值與尊嚴，就是恢復人性的光明。怎樣才算是美德，胡先生祗提出了簡單的四個字：「勤」和「勇」，是煆煉自己的要素，「仁」和「誠」，是對人的根本。能具備四種美德，即是為人之道，也就是成功之道。尤其對於靑年們，除了要學問的基礎打好以外，更必須要有品性修養，這才是事業成功的原始資本。</p>
<p>最後，討論政治，現在好多人對於政治的見解，是以古老的或是未曾理解的思想作出發點，復以世俗的，不合理的道德標準作規矩。因此才釀成中國的內亂，和國際間的予盾。胡氏提出叛亂是有政治的因素，所以戡亂必須軍事與政治雙管齊下，才得消滅亂源。政治的改造，必有所依據，要明瞭歷史的背效，要認識國際的局勢，同時要確立建國的目標，政治改革方能收效。作者提出目前中國政治的革新，應以「收堍人心，樹立威信」，為基本的法則。使人民對政府有信心，能得全國人民之合作，俾戰禍日趨縮小，秩序漸趨恢復。</p>
<p>政治的改革，並非一二人之事，而是全國人民共同合作的成果。要使每個人從事這一件艱鉅的工作，必須從每個人思想上，道德上革新做起。方今憲政政府成立伊始，謹以此書來介紹給每一位靑年，使靑年們在思想上，道德上能加以改造，進而再共同來從事政治的革新。則中華民族氣運之轉機，當可佇立而待。</p>
<h3>現代學術文化概論</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>竺可楨等著　張其昀編輯</p>
<p>華夏圖書公司版定價六元</p>
<p>「現代學術文化概論」據　者例言說：將分為四部分，即：（一）人文學，（二）社會科學，（三）自然科學，（四）應用科學。現在介紹的便是今年三月出版的第一册。這本書包括論文十篇，由各大學教授分任撰述。竺可柏先生的一科學之方法與精神」，他的結論語重心長，發人深省，不愧為科學界的權威。他說：「愛好和平為中國人之特性，而科學愈發達，則戰爭愈猙獰可怕，愈使世界不得不實現和平，如何能使將來的世界一方面科學仍繼續發達，而一方面却又可實現和平，這是目前極嚴重的一個問题，而亦是我們中國應該有特殊的供獻的一個問題。」賀麟先生的「儒家思想」，他以為中國文化的特徴，還是儒家思想，或新儒家思想。立論似陳舊，其實是新穎。他的見地和馮友蘭先生在新理學一書裏所講的有類似的地方，不標新，不立異。正中書局最近出版賀先生的「儒家思想新論」，是否即是此文的擴充，因為尚未見到，不敢臆測。朱光潛先生的「現代中國文學」，微嫌簡略，但他的結論是正確的。他說：西方影嚮的輸入，使中國文學面臨上一個極嚴重底問題，就是傳統。我們的新文學可以說是在承受西方底傳統，而忽略了中國固有底傳統。互相影嚮原是文化交流所必有的現象，中國文學接受西洋底影嚮，是勢所必至，理有固然底。但是完全放棄固有底傳統，歷史會蹬明這是不聰明底……」又說：「我們的新文學還在開始，我們還在摸路，我們要謙虛底學習，更多方底嘗試和更堅定底努力」。朱先生是中國文學界的權成，他的「詩論」以及批評陶淵明那幾篇文字，都是鞭辟入裏的作品；這篇短短的文字中，所蘊藏上的也不算少。不過我們希望朱先生對於現在中國文學能有更多的叙述和批判，以嘉惠後學。其他如張其昀張蔭麟謝幼偉……諸位先生的大作都够得上如本醫例言上所說的。「旨在啓發學生對於各種學術之興趣，指示其門徑，說明其方法」這幾句話，所以敢為介紹於高中以上的學生們，作為課外的讀物。</p>
<h3>盧梭的教育思想</h3>
<p>— 李溶如</p>
<p>「盧梭教育思想」　滕大春編著　國立編譯館出版　商務印書館發行</p>
<p>十八世紀的盧梭（J．J．Rousseau），是一位劃時代的偉大思想家。憑藉他底犀利深刻的觀察；和熱情奔放的性格，對傳統文明控制下的當時法國社會，勇猛地舉起了反抗的旗幟。他底最有力的名著民約論（Social　Contract）和愛彌兒（Emile），提供若干甚為新穎的見解，毫無疑義的，那時頹廢腐化的社會，被大大地震動了。由民約論中，我們可以知道盧梭的政治理想。他說：「人是生而自由的，却到處受上束縛。」又說：「專制政體並不是統治人民使他們宰福；乃是使人民貧困，以便統治他們。」從這些慷慨激昻的話語中，可見他對於專制政體的憤慨痛恨的情緒了。不久以後的法國大革命，很明顯的是受了盧梭思想的鼓　。代表他底教育思想的，是鉅著愛彌兒于醫。在那個時代，整個的教育制度和設施，都爲陳腐的反理性的精神所籠罩瀰漫。利用傳統的風俗，習慣，教條等來强制束縛個人，個性發展的重要性彼抹殺了，全是違反自然的。天才被桎梏了；個性被摧殘了，個人變成了教條的奴隸。針對這種種的時弊，盧梭攘臂疾呼「歸於自然」的口號，熟烈倡導順乎自然的教育，企岡將個人從那戕害人性的教育的桎梏下解放出來。近代新教育的理論及其實施，多係得自他底思想的啓發。在歐美，有不少的學者，從事研究慮梭論著的工作。國人對此雖有片斷的紹介，但有系統的嚴密的論述，過去確付闕如。今滕大春先生蒐集各項有關的材料，編著「盧梭教育思想」一書，客觀地評述盧梭的整個教育思想，俾讀者得以窺其梗概。筆者近誦閱該書　一遍，覺其內容差强人意，深感有向讀者諸君推薦的必要。</p>
<p>本書計分十二章，第一章談盧梭的生平，首將他的一生，分為三個階段：能力儲備時期，著述時期，流放時期，分段加以描述。其次對於性格方面，亦有詳細的說明。第二章則敘其所處的時代。一，二兩章可助讀者更深入地理解他底思想的綫索，這是本書最大的貢獻。第三章論歸於自然（Return　to　Nature），此為盧梭思想的中心所在。何謂「自然」？其涵義本書作者有極為精深的詮釋。第四章論自然人，大可以盧梭理想的教育目的論視之。第五章論發展，發展的觀念，在教育上非常重要，一切的設施，應配合兒童身心發展的程序。盧梭最　視「發展」，在當時的西歐，確是一種嶄新的見解。第六·七·八·九·十諸章，則分述體育感官教育，知識教育，道德教育，宗教教育的實施方法，是他的教育方法諭。第十一章詳述盧梭關於女子教育的主張。最末一章是你對盧梭整個教育思想的批評。</p>
<p>盧梭最為世人非難的，是他對，於女子教育的意見；及極端輕視國民教育職業教育的觀忿。本書作者認為：「盧梭是一個絕頂才智之士，又最富於浪漫的氣質，太過熱情，太渦敏感，偏偏又處在一個陳舊的時代，偏偏又經過了一個怨凄的身世。他的憤世嫉世；他的牢騷感慨；他的狂呼；他的怒吼，都是情理之常。」為了急於衝破舊教育的樊籠，在他的議論中，渦於偏激的地方自難避免。但他對近代新教育的貢獻，却亦不容一概抹殺，如：「兒童福利運動的創導」，「生活教育的創導」，及「兒童本位教育的倡導」。都是獨特的卓見，他誠然不愧是一位近世的啓　運動者。滕先生依據他的生平，性格及時代背景，設身處地的為盧梭申辯，入情入理，頗能消除一般的誤解，這是值得重視的一點。</p>
<p>本書　優點有三；（一）文筆流暢，統觀全書的文字描述，有行　流水之感，予讀者以淸新愉快，印象。（二）觀點公允客觀，不為傳統的偏見所　，根據客觀可信的資料，評論盧梭的教育思想。（三）結構嚴密，層次分明，有引人入勝之妙。至於其缺點，自然亦有，其主要的有二：（一）每章篇末，未附有有關參攷書日，讀者若進一步研究時，殊感不便。（二）關於性教育的理論，在愛彌兒一醫中，盧梭有極為詳盡的闡述。本書對此方面的討論，未免過於節略，這是美中不足的地方。</p>
<p>大體上來說，本書畢竟是值得我們閱讀的一本醫，這點筆者是可以負責保證的。</p>
<h3>認識我們的友邦：印度——「印度科學」讀後</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>中印兩國的關係不能和其他國家關係相比，文化的交流，同病的相憐已使這兩個復甦的老兄弟之間沒有利害的衝突，却有義愛的交情。但是慚愧的很，對這個偉大的友邦的認識上，特別關於她在科學建設上的努力和成就，我們敢宣稱是極端的不够。因之，我們特別向國內科學工作者介紹劉咸教授所著的「印度科學」一書（正中書局出版），從這本有系統的講述印度的科學的書中，我們不但更深一層的認識我們的老友邦，而且從他們摸索了　一百年的經驗中，我們可以找出一條中國在從事科學建設上應該循照的健康的道路。</p>
<p>劉成教授以四個題目分別紹介印度的科學，（一）印度古時之科學；（二）二十世紀以前之印度科學；（三）二十世紀之印度科學；（四）印度科學刋物及專家。並且作者認為「英帝國在兼併印度後的教育政策對印度科學有巨大關係」，因之又有一篇專檢討從一七五七年後英國政府的教育行政政策。</p>
<p>在十二世紀之前印度在學術思想上的活躍很像中國春秋戰國百家爭鳴一樣，這時他們巳在科學上有所建樹，如阿拉伯十進位數字的發明（不是阿拉伯人發明的），一一二年巴司卡拉（Bhaskara）在代數上的輝煌貢獻。但到婆羅門教的復活，便一手壓殺了這股活力；一直到十八世紀英帝國的兼併後纔又使印度人能自由的去追求科學。這點很像中國西漢時的儒教獨尊的壓殺作風。</p>
<p>在二十世紀之前印度人在科學上還是埋頭學習的時候，一進了這個西方人所謂「東方人的覺醒世紀」的二十世紀，他們便開始結出燦爛之花了。科學機構的擴大和增多，科學名家的輩川都足以顯示出他們的耕耘巳經開始結果了，就中成就最大的是數學，理論物理學，電化學，膠體化學，天文物理學，植物形熊學，古植物學家等科學。許多卓越的科學家的成就不但使世界人重新估定了印度民族的智慧能力，也使印度人恢復了他們的自信心，因此他們最崇拜的印度三聖中，科學家波士（Sir　Chandra　Bose）便是一聖；其他兩聖便是世人熟知的甘地和泰戈爾了。波士爵士最大的成就是在理論物理學上和植物學上，如波士·愛因斯坦統計法（BossBoss-Einstein　Sta-tistics）就是他的發見。</p>
<p>東方人第一次而到現在為止也是唯一的獲得諾員爾科學獎金（印度文豪泰戈爾獲得的是文學獎金不算）的是印度物理學家刺曼博士（Dr．Venkata　Raman），光譜學上最有名的「刺　效應」便是他的得意發見。印度科學家的成名多在年少之時，而且他的出身多不是貴族，完全從貧苦中奪鬥出來，如刺曼博士的許多論文是在印度財政部小職員任內寫出的。對數論造詣最高的天才數學家刺曼奴佳（Srinivasa　Ram-anujun）並未受過高等教育而是一個信託公司的小醫記，但是刻苦克服難關終使他們有機會發揮自己的智慧。比之中國，印度的社會階級，宗教影嚮，語言及貧富懸殊都是發展科學的死敵，但他們雖然克服了；對今日在苦難中奮鬥的中國科學工作者多少有點鼓勵的。</p>
<p>原作者認為印度科學之所以有今日這樣地位除了由於印度科學家埋頭苦幹外，而「各種學會實有車大作用」，因之他用了巨多篇幅介紹印度目前許多科學學會和大學的科學活動；英帝國在印度執行的殖民政策是「可咒駡的」，但他們協助印度人建立的科學機構及大量擴充大學教育是值得歡呼一下，如從一九一一年創始的印度科學會議，每屆都有世界科學先進參加，其規模之大氣魄之大與印度人的貧苦是「不相稱的」，但印度政府在任何情况下「都盡最大努力扶助科學的」，所以他們能舉辦許多有意義的科學活動。</p>

<h3>讀「膽怯的人」</h3>
<p>— 紀平</p>
<p>正如譯者李　所說：「此書的大特點，是在作者取材的實際，這種與實生活肉搏的場面簡易明白。高爾基因此書，一躍而登世界界文的的最高峯決非偶然的幸事。」</p>
<p>的確，這位世界底文豪給我們活生生地　出一幅眞實的沙皇統制下的俄國社會。尤其是主人公福瑪，我們彷彿親眼看他誕生，成長，以至變為個傻子，陰鬱而凄凉地微笑上。性格，是如此的突出。</p>
<p>從這裏，從這六百六十頁的巨著裏，我們淸淸楚楚地看到了俄國的貴族，商人，官史，勞工，知識勞動者，婦女，以及妓女等的生活，在作者底剛勁的筆下，毫無遺漏地刻畫着。　穿全書的是一種不變的濃厚而又沉鬱的生命力，像是被層層烏雲遮蓋住的陽光，使人在陰黯的天色下感受上强烈的熱度？</p>
<p>高爾基底著作裏，常常潛藏上無比的熟與力的。「膽怯的人」也是如此。</p>
<p>福瑪，這個富商的兒子是這樣的：</p>
<p>「看起來，他好像在期待上什麼事一樣——好像有某種掩　敝物遮住了他的眼睛一樣，他死了的母親在生時，也是一樣暗中摸索地過活上。」</p>
<p>福瑪確是在暗中摸索，他確是在期待，雖然連他自己也不明白，他倒底在期待些什麼。眞實的生活毫無間歇地推動他，使他不由自主地走上連他自己也看不淸楚的窄路。通向滅亡的窄路。</p>
<p>作者用最簡扼的比喻，非常尖銳地寫出極其深刻的含義。當福塲因為父喪而號啕大哭之後，他底教父，一個更貪吝，更險詐的商人，這樣輕快而神秘地對他說：</p>
<p>「你現在就是前綫上的總指揮，你應當勇敢地指揮你底兵士。你底兵士就是盧布。你有很不少的兵士，你要不間斷地作戰！</p>
<p>他的父親，他的姑母，他的教父，祿寶福，淑　亞，這許多人，不是教導他如何去理解人生，即是抱怨人生。</p>
<p>「究竟這是什麼意義呢？」他思索上。「如果人不就是人生，什麼是人生呢？人們講起來，總好像人生是另外的什麼東西。……這東西妨礙人們的生存，恐怕這就是惡魔吧！」一種恐怖的感覺向這靑年　來。</p>
<p>能回答他的只有街道上的荒涼與寂靜。</p>
<p>於是，像一般擁有財富者底子弟一樣，他整大把無處安排的時間消磨在賭與酒裏。</p>
<p>一切的人，同他一樣，都變得狂野如歡，都為這同一的黑浪所襲，再像垃圾般地被運走。這一切人，同他一樣，都害怕前望，怕看淸了這來勢汹汹的波浪會將他們帶到什麼地方去。將他們的恐怖流沒於酒肉，他們在那急流中向前衝突，一面又掙扎上，呌喚上，做些無意義的事，裝傻，鼓嗓上，鼓嗓上，但決不能愉快。</p>
<p>福瑪就這樣不知不覺地隨上波浪捲去，他看上別人在用力的勞動時，也想到過自己的體力。只是，沒有一點用用處。</p>
<p>就這樣，日子糊糊塗塗地糟踏掉了。</p>
<p>三年以珀，他流浪回來，「神情疲憊「衣衫褸，頭腦昏　，時常醉上，眉頭深鎖，頭垂於胸膛上，現得非常沉鬱。」</p>
<p>是的，福瑪自己講出了所以如此的原因：</p>
<p>「……我是由於盲目而完了，我看得太少，所以我變得像梟似的盲目了——。」</p>
<p>以福瑪的一生為經，作者更深刻地，以當時的社會背景為緯，互相參雜在一起，給我們剖示了各種人們底眞正的生活與內在的靈魂。</p>
<p>作者僅僅給我們一團尚未開　的火，一幅沉鬱而混雜的人間圖畫，但，由此，讀者被啓示了，我們從這裏得到了生活的教訓，我們將因此擇取並創造正確的，步入眞理的大路。祝福迫求眞理的人們。祝福人類底巨星。</p>

<h3>鍥而不舍</h3>
<p>— 惕齋</p>
<p>雖然荀子勸學篇說「鍥而舍之，朽木不折；鍥而不舍，金石可縷」，可是做學問能够這樣的眞少見，所以大學設立將近百年，中學之數，動以千計，而按照時間空間的乘積來計算學者的數字，未免太少了。這一方面證明讀書人之未能鍥而不舍，一方面也證明天才之可遇而不可求。</p>
<p>但道地做到鍥而不舍的却不是學生，而是商人的廣告。可口可樂以五十億（合美金三千元，即戰前之國幣一萬元也）在全運會塲上大出風頭，固無論矣，即以我所目覩的而論，近來有許多極小極小的生意人也模仿了這一套，有時極不信廣告的我們也會不由自主的上了圈套。我每星期因授課關係，往返蘇州，蘇州車站上有個賣鎖的傢伙，穿了和車站職員一樣的制服帽子，先於開車前卅分鐘在車箱裏大講其坐車常識，什麼車票要藏好呀，送人的人要早下車呀，幾個人一道走路，車票要分帶呀，以及天氣漸熱，不可亂擲烟蒂等等，初次我頗贊美車站服務之周到，很注意的聽下去，且有許多老年人點頭贊嘆，以爲亂世難逢如此好人。不料下面銳下去便不對了，由遊虎丘靈岩而談到行李皮包，然後就引到鎖上，描寫了一頓鎖的重要，隨即掏出一把小鎖，形容其彈簧之靈敏，又宣傳此乃國貨，說是陳列在南京路某某公司的，—天曉得！—可是却說不賣，只是介紹。這疑陣布得很不錯，可以把人們對於野鷄生意的厭惡心减低。以後，又拿出來六只別針，也算介紹，如是，一根縫衣針，裝在小玻瓶中，一根銅的牙籤，零零星星幾種，最後，才說逍全算贈品，如有人願買鎖的，按半價贈送，並普遍送這些贈品云云，大約其價値自二萬元逐漸增至三四萬。這時離開車還有十多分鐘，居然給他賣掉兩三打；每星期我必恭聆此公講演一次，而且每次都有人買，中國人數目眞多，除我之外，畢竟感到重複的很少，而且廣告之効用，或者即在其强聒而不舍也。</p>
<p>大都市中的霓虹燈及無綫電，豈不也是此例之一，我們的耳目幾乎無形中喪失自由。世事之成功，有時因爲對方之需要，有時由於對方之愛好，這全不奇，有的由於對方之厭煩，則吾人始料所不及者。我曾於謀事一點見之，舊日筆記記某官送當朝袱臣一妾，即以他自己的名字名之，受者難免不大驚，送禮的則脫的好：「希望太師爺每逢用到她的時候，就會記起下官的名字，下官就受惠不少了！」此即廣告學之應用於人事者，吾人正因不願聽香烟廣告或懶怠着牙膏霓虹燈，而不得不記住其名字也。</p>
<p>據說上海初有電車時，車上有廣告：「人人可坐」，此爲不折不扣之誠實廣告。凡誠實廣告，根本可以不要，所以至今除漲價發新聞外，絕未曾聽說雷車或公共汽車登廣告。米店汕鹽店亦無此必要，然而軋米軋油正有時時出人命之危險，這眞是想不通的事：—越是需要的越不要說，不需要的偏偏要拼命送進耳邊來！天下人才，只有劉玄德去請諸葛亮，萬無諸葛亮登求職廣告之理。若是果眞劉備不知有諸葛亮，此乃劉備的責任，不能怨諸葛亮不登廣告也。</p>
<p>自然，我們不希望人登廣告求職，但却非常希望米店油鹽店或電車汽車登廣告大减價。</p>
<h3>如何看戲？</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>我所謂看戯，係指京劇而言。我以爲：第一，不要以爲今人不如古人。陳德霖（蘭芳的老師）唱幾句，固然比闌芳好，然而就全戯之藝術言，蘭芳實在靑出於藍，在其師之上。現在老生中幾個名角，如馬連良，譚富英，誠然不能比昔日之譚鑫培，而以旦角言，則梅博士現在的地位，實勝於前，等於從前老譚在鬚生的地位，可以稱戯界大王而無　。</p>
<p>第二，看戯應看到內部，不可專看外面一點皮毛。在上海看梅博士戯的人，十人中到有八九人言闌芳老了，不如從前。我的看法相反，我以爲現在正是闌芳最好之時，蓋爐火純靑，已到化境。譬如御碑亭一戯，孟月華有幾個跑塲，水袖上幾個動作，實在美極，蘭芳以前演戯，尚不能將內心表演，達於外部，刻畫劇中人到極點也。上海大多數人看戯，尤有一毛病，看梅博士的戯，必定要看醉酒，鳳還巢，霸王別姬等戯，其實如御碑亭一類戯，又何嘗不佳！眞正名角，無論唱何戯，皆有其精彩不可及處。</p>
<p>以上不過就戲之藝術而言，並非爲梅博士寫傳；（梅博士也不需區區爲之捧塲。）在四十年前，我在故都讀書時，到闌芳家中去過多次，而現在馬斯南路的梅宅，我並不知道其門牌號數。</p>
<p>去年杜壽孟小冬的搜孤救孤，其「娘子不必太烈性」幾段唱詞固佳，然其一抬腿，一舉手，皆有尺寸，此等地方方足以見其苦功，眞實本領。從前老譚唱狀元譜（打侄上墳），其全戲之精采，固不必言，最後進台，其幾步路眞是空前絕後，美到極點，從其背面動態可以表現劇中之人物喜怒哀樂，如見其肺肝然。藝術能到如此地位，眞是令人歏觀止矣。</p>
<p>名角有一種工夫，易爲人知者，如侗五演三拉（販馬記），其帽翅左邊的動，右邊的不動，右邊的連連動，左邊的又文風不動。程網仙扮周瑜，頭上的長翎子，左邊的打一圈，右邊的不動，右邊的打一圈，左邊的不動，忽然一來，左右兩邊的　子同時各打一圈，此等絕活，完全係頭上的一股勁，必須若干年的苦功，始能得之。</p>
<p>總之，唱戲難，看　也不容易，梅博士這次在天蟾露演，買票不易，天天滿座，然而眞能賞識其藝術者，恐怕只佔最少數吧？</p>
<h3>板煙</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>我是一個不甚吸板烟的人，但是我的抵抗購買慾的能力很薄弱。每次我次我走過一家揩拭得整潔通明的烟行的玻璃櫉櫥前面、其中陳列着的式樣各別光澤照人的烟斗，終是吸信了我的注意力。我就這樣的絡終續練的買了四個烟斗，放在我的寫字桌的一隅。</p>
<p>我購冒煙斗以後，自然還得去買「淡巴菰」。我起初買的是一種裝在鐵罐內襯着蠟紙不致受潮的所謂「一半又一半」牌。我通扯一星期吸一二回，直到最近才吸完。</p>
<p>此外，我的「烟具」還包括盛烟草的袋（Pouch），通烟斗用的裹在絨布內的鐵絲，耐燃燒的火柴等等。</p>
<p>一般說來，吸板烟似較吸捲烟上算。一盒板烟至少可以吃半月至十天，而且遇有客人時，也無須用板烟敬客，等於節省捲烟的開支。不過，日來的物價終是向前跑，以前由物資供應局委託各商店零售的一種烟絲帶黑色的「模範脾」烟草，現在也要買到十萬元一包了。</p>
<h3>文人怪癖</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>英國小說家迭更司歡喜帶寶石。</p>
<p>美國詩人兼短篇小說作家亞倫坡喜歡與他的貓同睡。</p>
<p>美國幽默作家馬克吐溫，喜歡穿上白色的衣服，就是在冬天，也不脫掉。</p>
<p>法國小說家杜德喜歡帶着眼鏡睡覺。</p>
<h3>總統先德</h3>
<p>— 若</p>
<p>總統日前到宜興縣西北四十餘里之都山，要謁漢函卒鄕侯蔣公墓，曾迭誌報端。考函亭鄕侯諱澄，字少明，父橫，佐光武帝討赤眉有功，被　而死，有十九人，俱南徙，函亭鄉侯與其八兄雲陽亭侯默皆居陽羨（即今宜興）之滆湖，今宜興蔣氏皆其裔孫。唐天寶十五載，蔣氏後人所立函亭鄕侯蔣公墓碑銘，原石已不存，碑文尚戰家譜中，爲秘書少監齊光又所撰，晋時函亭鄉侯子孫有一支選居台州，五代時又有一支自合州遷寗波，故宜興台州寗波各地蔣氏皆可聯族。總統篤念先德，去年回奉化，曾謁宋金紫光祿大夫蔣公浚明墓，此次至宜興，謁函亭鄕侯墓，皆總統嫡派之祖也。</p>
<h3>每字美金一元的稿費</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>最近上海有一家雜誌規定稿費最高額爲每千字白米二斗，一時出版界儼然以爲是對作家們特別的優遇，當作一件豪舉。</p>
<p>但是，據最近紐約先鋒論壇報的報道，在目前的美國，稿費每字美金一元已經不算希奇，而傳聞溫莎公爵和邱吉爾在生活畫報上發表的回憶錄的稿費竟尚遠過此數，但確數不詳。</p>
<p>遠在四十年前，英國以歌頌帝國主義著名的桂冠詩人吉百齡就已得到過每字美金一元的稿費，當時倒的確大家認爲異數。有一位美國人就寫了一封信給吉百齡說：一聽說足下山賣文學，每字美金一元，今即附函奉上美金一元，請賜樣品一份。」</p>
<p>吉百齡把這一元收下，給他一封回信，信上祗一個字：「謝」。</p>
<p>過了幾天，那位美國顧客又寫了一封信給吉百齡，說：「你的『謝』字業總以二元出售，除郵費及信紙信封一應開銷外，净賺美金九角正，此款應由足下與鄙人平分，今附奉足下應得之四角五分（郵票），即請台收。」</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>英王擬出巡澳印，以其公主伊麗沙白攝政。此短期之攝政，略如舊時官塲所謂「代拆代行」。荷闌女王咸廉明娜，因登極已五十年，老而倦勤，擬於舉行慶祝大典後，授其公主裘麗安娜爲攝政王，自身則退處安閒，優游歲月，以樂餘年。此種攝政乃繼統之階梯，如中國之所謂「內禪」。</p>
<p>中國歷史上帝王出游，或曰「巡狩」，或曰「巡方」，於都城例派「留守」之王公大臣，不過照料門戶之類，無須攝政。帝王所至之處，名曰「行在」，有隨駕之重要人員，照常辦公。淸代皇帝大權獨攬，如康熙乾隆，屢屢離京，流連各省，隨時隨地，批交各省或交留守諸臣遵辦，自無攝政之必要，惟淸初之多爾　以幼皇之叔攝政，淸末之載灃，以幼皇之父攝政，皆因君主方在孩提之年，故無論爲王爵攝政，或太后垂簾，都是皇帝之尊長。若西方君主必須成年方能登位，至年老或病，乃有攝政，故彼之攝政，恒爲君主之子女卑幼，先以「攝政」，繼以「即眞」，此則近於中國之傳位於太子。</p>
<p>中國之「內禪」，所謂「大廷授受」，非常之典，每含不可告人之內幕。如唐高祖之傳位於太宗，因玄武門之變，二王已膏鋒刃，世民不奪不　李淵不讓亦不行了。宋高宗之傳位孝宗，爲的是享太上皇之福，孝宗雖非親生之子，頗能盡孝，然高宗之偸情昏庸，已無足道。至孝宗之傳位於光宗，光宗又傳位於寗宗，光怪陸離，有如兒戯。淸乾隆之傳位於嘉慶，是因本身已八十五歲，不耐日行瑣務，立新君代勞，自己則仍握政要大權。嘉慶擁虛位而受眞氣，故乾隆一旦歸西，嘉慶親政，立即收殺和坤（乾隆之寵臣），以洩夙憤。</p>
<p>歐洲歷史上之君主國逐漸淘汰，兩次大戰，又消滅了幾個。現存者大如英吉利，小如荷蘭，各有良好之王家典範。國民程度高，國家基礎穩固，组織妥善，君主於政治上無極權，於宮庭無隱患，攝政或繼承，按部就班，自無問題。</p>

<h3>Important Meeting in the Presidential Palace, Economic Departments Determined to Strengthen, Yu Hongjun Returns to Nanjing to Repeatedly Resign as Minister of Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] After Weng Wenhao organized the new Executive Yuan, he spent the entire day of the 26th in contact with various related parties and again visited the President for instructions. Important meetings were held in the Presidential Palace both morning and evening. Although the candidates for Vice President, heads of various ministries and commissions, and both Chief and Deputy Secretaries-General have been largely decided, due to the need for further consultation and agreement with some, the announcement could not be made on the 26th. Political circles here generally hope that Mr. Weng can propose a list that meets public expectations with the utmost prudence, so that the new Executive Yuan lives up to its name and becomes a responsible cabinet, in order to complete the two major tasks of suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution. It is reported that Yu Hongjun, Li Weiguo, Wang Chonghui, Chen Lifu, Yu Bin, and others visited Mr. Weng one after another on the morning of the 26th to discuss matters such as the formation of the cabinet. It is said that Mr. Weng firmly invited Li Weiguo to serve as Secretary-General, and Li has already expressed his willingness to accept. In the afternoon, Mr. Weng also visited Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, Yu Feipeng, and others. Discussions regarding the inclusion of members of the Min[zhushehui dang, Democratic Socialist Party] and Qing[nian dang, Youth Party] parties into the cabinet are also continuing.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] After Weng Wenhao took over as the head of the Executive Yuan, he decided to strengthen the relevant economic departments. The Executive Yuan originally established the National Economic Council (全經會). Mr. Weng believes that it is still necessary to establish it after the establishment of the new Executive Yuan. According to Article 14 of the new organizational law of the Executive Yuan: "The Executive Yuan may establish various committees within the Yuan to handle specific affairs." Therefore, the continued establishment of the National Economic Council has a basis in regulations. It is reported that after the establishment of the new Executive Yuan, the National Economic Council will continue to be established and strengthened. The position of Secretary-General of the Council was vacated when Lou Tongsun resigned and was approved during Zhang Chun's tenure as head of the Executive Yuan, and Gu Yulang has been appointed as acting Secretary-General. It is very likely that Gu will be formally appointed in the future. As for the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Gu's name is also highly mentioned, so Gu's new position will be one of the two, and the official announcement will be made after the new cabinet is formed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The President has recently issued an instruction to all directly subordinate agencies: "The Executive Yuan Organization Law, promulgated on March 31, 1936 [Republican calendar], and amended on December 25 of the same year, shall be implemented from May 25 of this year."</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun went to Shanghai to take over as Governor of the Central Bank. He returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 26th after completing his official duties. After disembarking, Mr. Yu immediately paid respects to the President and Premier Weng to report on the financial situation in Shanghai and the handover of the Central Bank. When reporters visited and asked if he was willing to continue serving as Minister of Finance in the new cabinet, Mr. Yu stated that he had repeatedly pleaded with the authorities to resign from the position of Minister of Finance. Now that the new cabinet has been established, it is only right to replace him with a new person to usher in a new administration, and he also feels deeply that his energy is insufficient, so he has no intention of continuing and has once again earnestly expressed his intention to resign to the authorities. It is also learned that the replacement of the Minister of Finance has been determined. After Mr. Yu returned to Nanjing, he instructed his subordinates to prepare for the handover. Qu Jingchun, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, also issued a notice on the 26th, scheduling a meeting with the heads of various units at 9:00 AM on the 28th to discuss the handover matters.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to sources, after Zhang Jia'ao resigned from the position of Governor of the Bank of Communications, he has no intention of serving as Minister of Finance in the new cabinet, and will instead practically oversee the utilization of US aid. Gu Yiqun is more likely to assume the position of Minister of Finance.</p>
<h3>Organizational Regulations of the Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee Promulgated</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] President Chiang issued an order on the 26th as follows: The Organizational Regulations of the Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee are hereby enacted and promulgated. This order.</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations of the Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee</p>
<p>Article 1 These regulations are formulated in accordance with the resolution of the First National Assembly, First Session.</p>
<p>Article 2 The members of this committee shall be appointed by the government from those First National Assembly representatives who freely participate.</p>
<p>Article 3 The tasks of this committee are as follows:</p>

<p>(3) Matters related to the investigation and study of the implementation of constitutional governance</p>
<p>(4) Matters related to the promotion of the implementation of constitutional governance</p>
<p>(5) Matters related to the supervision and review of constitutional governance entrusted by the government</p>
<p>Article 4 This committee shall have one chairman and two to four vice-chairmen, who shall be appointed by the government. The chairman shall preside over the affairs of the committee, and the vice-chairmen shall assist.</p>

<h3>Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee Established on June 1st</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The Preparatory Committee of the Constitutional Governance Supervisory Committee held its third meeting at 3:30 PM on the 26th to discuss the organizational regulations of the committee and decided to establish it on June 1st. More than 200 committee members attended today's meeting. Chairman Li Hongru presided over the meeting. During the discussion of the organizational regulations, speakers were very enthusiastic. The committee had originally drafted two versions of the organizational regulations, which had not yet been decided. However, the Presidential Palace announced the organizational regulations of the committee on the 26th, which differed greatly from what the committee had drafted. During the extensive discussion, some committee members believed that the committee was an organization formed by representatives themselves and did not belong to a government agency. The government's order to appoint the chairman and vice-chairmen was not legal because the organizational regulations had not been subject to legislative procedures. Therefore, some committee members believed that it was not necessary to use the organizational regulations promulgated by the government order as the basis and instead proposed to elect committee members to review the draft prepared by the committee itself, which was approved by a majority of votes. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>President Promulgates Orders Amending Budget and Final Accounts Laws</h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The President issued the following orders on the 26th: (1) The amended Budget Law is hereby promulgated. This order. (2) The amended Final Accounts Law is hereby promulgated. This order. (3) The amended Articles 16, 22, 35, 90, 119, 123, 124, and 125 of the Accounting Law are hereby promulgated. This order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Organizational Law of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has been promulgated by presidential order and will be implemented today.</p>
<h3>Director-General of the Executive Yuan Information Office Dong Xianguang to Remain in Post</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] It has been largely confirmed that Dong Xianguang will remain in his position as Director-General of the Executive Yuan Information Office. Mr. Dong had resigned when Zhang Chun's Executive Yuan collectively resigned. Weng Wenhao is currently in discussions to persuade him to stay, but it has not yet been finalized. The press conference of the Information Office was still held at 3:30 PM on the 26th, but Mr. Dong did not attend because he had already resigned and was in a difficult position to "speak" during the transition between the old and new Executive Yuan. Only military spokesperson Deng Wenyi reported on the week's war situation before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Members of the Control Yuan to Report for Duty Starting Tomorrow, Session Scheduled for Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The first session of the Control Yuan under the Constitution will convene on June 5th, and members of the Control Yuan are scheduled to report for duty starting on the 28th. This session will last approximately two weeks. The issues to be discussed are simpler than those in the Legislative Yuan. The initial tasks are to elect the President and Vice President of the Yuan and to agree on the rules of procedure. The budget for the preparatory expenses for this session has been approved at 34 billion yuan. The reception office has been prepared, and members of the Control Yuan from various locations will be able to receive accommodation upon arrival in Nanjing. The meeting venue is currently located at the Lizhi Society, and a hall is being added to the old site of the Legislative Yuan. It will be moved in after completion. Regarding the issue of the President of the Yuan, Yu Youren has not yet indicated that he will run for the position, but the vast majority of the more than 60 members of the Control Yuan in Nanjing have expressed their support for Mr. Yu to serve as the first President of the Yuan.</p>
<h3>Special Review Committee of the Legislative Yuan Discusses Issues of Various Committees</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The Special Review Committee of the Legislative Yuan held meetings on the 26th, both in the morning and afternoon. Chairman Cheng Tianfang presided over the meetings to discuss the issues related to various committees in the Organizational Law of the Yuan, which were referred to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Yuan. Six resolutions were passed: (1) The various committees will not have fixed conveners. (2) Each member shall only serve as a convener in the committee of their first preference. (3) The order of rotation for the conveners of each committee shall be determined by a single lottery. (4) The provision in Chen Guyuan's proposal that five convening members handle committee affairs on a monthly basis is unnecessary, and committee affairs shall be the responsibility of the secretariat staff. (5) The provision that each member may participate in three committees remains as in the original text of the organizational law. However, there were differing opinions on the number of members, with proposals for 199, 150, 99, 90, and 80 members, none of which were passed. They will be submitted to the Plenary Session of the Yuan for decision. The types and total number of committees will be discussed at the meeting on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Flies from Chongqing to Chengdu to Treat Dental Problems and Will Return to the Capital to Handle the Handover, Denies He Will Take Office as Director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chengdu, 26th] Zhang Qun and Mayor of Chongqing Yang Sen flew to Chengdu at 5:00 PM on the 26th. Wang Lingji, Liu Wenhui, and others welcomed them at the airport. According to Zhang, he was very pleased with the significant progress in Sichuan's administration after being away from his hometown for more than a year. He will only stay in Chengdu for three days before returning to Nanjing to handle the handover. He avoided answering questions about his future position, but he expressed his deep appreciation for Weng Wenhao's organization of the new cabinet.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 26th] Zhang Qun, Yang Sen, He Beiheng, and others flew to Chengdu at 4:00 PM on the 26th. Before his departure, Zhang said that Weng Wenhao's assumption of the post of head of the Executive Yuan would help stabilize the currency system, balance prices, and ensure the success of US aid. In addition to being largely used for suppressing bandits, the remaining US$400 million, if properly coordinated and applied, could achieve three goals: (1) Replenishing supplies of grain, gasoline, cotton, and other materials to stabilize prices; (2) Reducing foreign exchange expenditures to balance receipts and expenditures; (3) Converting materials into legal tender to help balance the fiscal budget. Zhang also said that it would be difficult to implement currency reform in the short term. This trip to Chengdu is to seek treatment for dental problems at the West China Medical College. He denied the rumors that he would attend a meeting of the heads of Sichuan, Xikang, and Chongqing, saying that there was no need to deny them. Now that he has left Chongqing and is in the constitutional era, there is no need to speculate about his personal actions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 26th] Zhang Qun said upon arriving in Chengdu: The rumors that I will take office as Director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters are purely fictitious.</p>

<h3>Execution of Aid to China Agreement Drafted, Rappehan to Arrive in China Within Ten Days, Decision Made to Establish General Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th, United Press] Rappehan revealed that the overall agreement on the implementation of the Aid to China plan has been drafted by the United States and will be submitted to China for study and signature.</p>
<p>The representative of the Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) in China, Rappehan, is expected to fly west from San Francisco on June 4th and arrive in Shanghai in seven days to formally begin implementing the Aid to China plan. Eight people will accompany Mr. Rappehan, including several railway, mining, and power experts. It is understood that after Mr. Rappehan arrives in China, his general office will be established in Shanghai, and another office will be established in Nanjing to maintain close contact with our government. Mr. Rappehan told a reporter from the Central News Agency alone today that the current Aid to China plan is scheduled to be completed by April 3, 1949, at which time a detailed report on the US$338 million in economic recovery funds must be submitted to the US Congress. It is heard that the experts participating in the Rappehan delegation will survey China's coal mines and the Yuehan Railway, which may take several years to complete and will exceed the time limit of the current Aid to China bill. Mr. Rappehan's organization in China has not yet been fully organized, but some of the staff members of the US Relief Mission in China under Gilbert may be recruited to join Mr. Rappehan's new organization. Mr. Rappehan's term in China is not fixed, but he will report directly to ECA Director Hoffman. Mr. Rappehan stated that the main task of the Aid to China plan is to increase production and distribute US aid materials in the Chinese mainland so that the greatest number of people can benefit. Mr. Rappehan, a former Mayor of San Francisco, first arrived in Beiping five days before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937. Last year, he briefly stayed in Shanghai during a round-the-world flight with US officials and reporters.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Israel's Misfortune!</h3>
<p>Since Britain announced the end of its rule and the birth of the new Jewish state, the Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine has evolved into a large-scale war. With the combined support of the Islamic League countries, the Arab army gathered a mighty force of 100,000 and launched a fierce attack on the Jewish army. They are now at the gates of the capital of Israel. If there is no infiltration of external factors, the Arab army will force the half-month-old state of Israel to sign a treaty under the city walls, and the Jews will probably be unable to resist. At the same time, the devastation of the Holy Land is also inevitable.</p>
<p>However, the Israeli authorities, aware of the critical situation in the Holy Land, know that waiting for the United Nations Security Council to invoke the most effective provisions of the Charter to halt the war between the two sides is "too slow" to be "effective." Distant water cannot quench a nearby fire, so they have already sent an urgent appeal to the Security Council, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly immediately issue a ceasefire order, forcing the Jewish and Arab sides to cease fire first. Although the General Assembly has issued a ceasefire order to both Jewish and Arab sides, and limited it to noon on the 24th, the Arab army's offensive has not slowed down at all, and the Arab League has requested the Security Council to extend the ceasefire order for 48 hours in order to determine the final attitude. With the support of Britain, the Arab League's request was accepted by the Security Council, and the deadline for the ceasefire order was extended to noon on the 26th. During this period, the U.S. government instructed its envoys in Arab countries to try to persuade the governments of their respective countries to accept the ceasefire order issued by the General Assembly. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also sent a strong note to the Arab League countries, urging them to accept the General Assembly's ceasefire order. However, the representatives of the Arab countries deliberated repeatedly and have not yet shown any signs of changing their attitude, and the government of Saudi Arabia has been the first to frankly express its refusal to obey the Security Council's order to cease fire. Therefore, summarizing the reports from all sides, we can see that the possibility of the Arab countries accepting the General Assembly's ceasefire order is very small. In other words, it seems inevitable that the state of Israel will suffer a catastrophe soon after its birth.</p>
<p>However, the United States has always advocated the partition of Palestine between Jewish and Arab sides and has been secretly supporting the Zionist movement. Although it recently changed its attitude and advocated placing Palestine under United Nations trusteeship, as soon as the state of Israel was born, the United States rushed to recognize it in fact, indicating that the United States still supports the Jewish state. From then on, the state of Israel relied on the United Nations institutions and American aid. Although the United Nations institutions wanted to invoke the most effective provisions of the Charter to immediately stop the war in the Holy Land, the Security Council has not passed any resolution due to differences of opinion between Britain and the United States, exposing the weakness and incompetence of the United Nations Security Council and disappointing the Jews, who have no choice but to shift their hopes entirely to the United States. Therefore, the interim President of Israel, Weizmann, made a special trip to Washington to beg President Truman for help. For the sake of maintaining America's international standing and winning the support of American Jews, President Truman naturally had to "lend a hand" to the crisis of the state of Israel. It is expected that the United States will assist the Jewish state in the following two ways: (1) Supplying arms. According to Washington news, President Truman acknowledges that lifting the ban on arms shipments to Israel is a matter of urgency; (2) Economic aid. According to Washington news, Weizmann requested a loan of 100 million US dollars from the United States, which President Truman has agreed to consider.</p>
<p>If the United States continues to do so, its relations with the Arab League countries will inevitably deteriorate. Syria and Egypt, two Islamic countries, have announced a blockade of the Palestinian coast in order to prevent American supplies from reaching Israel, and have arrested forty-one Americans on American ships heading to Palestine. In theory, these actions violate international law, and the U.S. authorities have repeatedly protested to the Arab countries, but in fact, if the Arab-Jewish war cannot be stopped, these problems cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>We have always held an objective view of the Palestinian problem and believe that it is a problem of religious and ethnic differences. The partition of Palestine between Jewish and Arab sides, from the perspective of religion and ethnicity, has no reason to be opposed, so after the state of Israel was born, the major powers successively recognized it, and the reason lies in this. However, observing from another angle, Palestine cannot be compared with India. The geographical conditions and economic factors determine that Palestine should not be divided into two independent countries. If the partition is forced, creating two countries, then neither country will possess the conditions that a modern state should have. In this situation, the Arab people's sworn opposition to the existence of the Jewish state is not entirely without reason. Therefore, the Palestinian problem itself is a complex problem, not to mention the infiltration of external factors into the Palestinian problem, turning it into a place of great power political struggle, so the Palestinian problem has become the most perplexing problem for the world.</p>
<p>In the past, Britain ruled Palestine and adopted a "divide and rule" policy, not only failing to mediate the conflicts between the two sides and enable them to coexist peacefully, but also deliberately exacerbating the contradictions between Arabs and Jews, thus allowing itself to occupy a pivotal position. The Palestinian problem has not been resolved for more than thirty years, and Britain's policy toward Palestine cannot but bear some responsibility. Recently, Britain suddenly announced the end of its rule in the Holy Land, but secretly still supports the Arabs, not only directing the Arab League behind the scenes, but also blatantly assisting the Arab army. No fewer than forty or fifty British officers serve as commanders in the Arab army, and most of the arms used by the Arab army are also supplied by Britain. Therefore, the connivance of great power politics has not only intensified the open and secret struggle for the Holy Land between the Soviet Union and the United States, but also caused conflicts between Britain and the United States. Furthermore, the United States' vacillation and lack of a consistent policy have led to the tragic situation in the Holy Land today. This can be said to be the misfortune of both the Jewish and Arab sides, and also the major powers reaping the bitter fruit of their own actions.</p>
<p>In short, the Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine has become the most perplexing international problem today. The only way to resolve it is for all the major powers to withdraw from the Holy Land and allow the Jewish and Arab sides to negotiate directly and peacefully resolve all the differences between them. Otherwise, even if the problem remains unresolved for a long time, it may not evolve into the most perplexing international problem.</p>
<h3>China Signs Tariff and Trade Agreement; Light Industry and Clothing Not Affected</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 26th] After China's representative signed the Tariff and Trade Agreement, there were concerns in the outside world about its impact on domestic industry and commerce. The reporter inquired with the Ministry of Finance on the 26th about the impact of the agreement on China. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry, the above-mentioned agreement was agreed upon at the Second Preparatory Meeting of the World Trade and Employment Conference in Geneva in 1947. The countries participating in the meeting included China, Britain, the United States, Canada, France, Australia, the Netherlands, India, and other eighteen countries. Based on the spirit of reciprocity, they agreed to mutually reduce import tariffs to promote bilateral trade. However, as China is an industrially backward country, in order to protect the nascent domestic industries, the Ministry, together with the Ministries of Economy and Foreign Affairs, carefully considered the matter before signing the protocol and instructed the representatives to go to the meeting to make further compromises. The scope of the current tariff reduction is extremely limited. Only 188 tariff items out of the 670 items in China's import tariff schedule are restricted, which is less than one-third of the total tariff items. Among them, 129 items maintain the original tariff rate (of which 80 items involve the entire item, and 49 items involve part of the item). Only 46 items have reduced tariffs (of which 36 items involve the entire item, and 10 items involve part of the item). In addition, for 13 items, part of the same tariff item maintains the original tariff rate, and part of it reduces tariffs. It is definitely not like the rumors in the outside world that all tariffs have been reduced. In terms of the specific amount of tariff reduction, the highest reduction is 10%, and the lowest reduction is 2%. In terms of the types of goods, the items with the most tariff reductions are metals and their products, such as automobiles, trucks, machinery, tools, tractors, and airplanes, totaling 59 items, which have no impact on China's light industry. The next most is food and beverages, such as wheat and flour, totaling 38 items. The next is chemical products and dyes, totaling 29 items, all of which are needed domestically. As for the extent of mutual concessions between China and other countries, a comparison can be made based on the value of goods. According to customs trade statistics in 1936 (the standard of normal trade before the war), the total value of goods for which China made concessions to various countries was approximately 250 million national currency, while the total value of goods for which various countries made concessions to China reached 320 million national currency, with the United States making the most concessions. The main items include soybeans, soybean oil, peanut oil, bristles, tung oil, tin, antimony, silkworm cocoons, raw silk, spun silk, camel hair, lace, embroidery, carpets, camphor, porcelain, hats and hat braids, hemp, eggs, and some cotton textiles, which are all important exports of China. Therefore, the agreement is actually more beneficial than harmful to China. Furthermore, the above-mentioned tariff reductions only apply to countries that have most-favored-nation clauses. Not all goods imported from any country can enjoy tariff reduction benefits. At present, China's import goods are still under foreign exchange quota allocation control. The above-mentioned tariff-reduced import goods will not be freely imported due to tariff reductions. Therefore, China's industrial sector still enjoys import restriction protection measures, so there is no need to worry about fulfilling the Tariff and Trade Agreement.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Social Affairs Formulates Plan to Provide Relief to Refugees Nationwide; Estimated to Provide Daily Relief to One Million People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Due to the spread of banditry and frequent natural disasters in China, according to reports from various places, the number of refugees nationwide reached 48 million last year. This year, the number of refugees is even greater, and the spring famine is severe, making refugee relief even more urgent. From last year to the present, the Ministry of Social Affairs has allocated relief funds and supplies totaling 493,509,480,000 yuan, more than 33,000 tons of food, and other cloth, clothing, cotton, etc. During the transitional period when the constitutional government is about to be established, 500 billion yuan has been specifically reserved for relief funds. In order to comprehensively handle national refugee relief, the Ministry of Social Affairs has formulated a plan for refugee relief in various important areas. After the implementation plans of each province and city are submitted to the Standing Committee of the Welfare and Relief Enterprise Review Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs for review and approval, they can be submitted to the Executive Yuan to handle the allocation of funds in batches by the American Relief Materials Committee and the American Relief Working Group. The main points of the plan are to provide relief to one million people every day. The target of relief is limited to refugees who cannot survive without assistance. Each person will be provided with 12.8 taels of food per day. The relief period will be three months, and every effort will be made to enable able-bodied men and women to participate in appropriate work relief, increasing production and helping them become self-sufficient. Those who can return to their hometowns will be assisted in returning to their hometowns and resuming their businesses. The total plan, excluding Qingdao, which has a separate plan, requires 34,200 tons of food. Estimated at the April food price this year, plus transportation and usage fees, the total cost is 25,086.6 billion yuan. The daily distribution of relief to one million refugees is as follows: Anhui 75,000, Jiangsu 100,000, Henan 100,000, Shandong 100,000, Hebei 95,000, Hubei 50,000, Rehe 30,000, Chahar 30,000, Suiyuan 30,000, Jiangxi 5,000, Shanxi 60,000, Northeastern Provinces and Cities 50,000, Gansu 10,000, Tianjin 30,000, Beiping 20,000, Xi'an 15,000, Shanghai 25,000, Nanjing 15,000, Qingdao 50,000, totaling 890,000 people.

<h3>Central Government Sympathizes with Silkworm Farmers' Hardships and Increases Spring Cocoon Purchase Price; Jiangxi and Zhejiang Production Expected to Reach 260,000 Dan This Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] It is learned that the price of cocoons this year was originally determined by the National Economic Council, with fresh cocoons in Zhejiang at 17 million yuan per dan (Jiangsu 18 million yuan per dan).

The Central Government has made every effort to be generous in setting these figures and will not adjust them again after the opening of the market. The guidance and breeding of spring cocoons this year has been very good, and it is expected that the production of the two provinces of Jiangxi and Zhejiang will reach 260,000 dan or more.</p>

<p>〔中央社迪化廿六日電〕(Central News Agency Dihua, 26th)</p>
<p>Recently, Hui Muslim villages scattered throughout various areas of Northeast Xinjiang have frequently been invaded by mounted bandits of unknown origin, who plunder livestock and murder residents.

Commissioner Uthman is very displeased with this situation, but under government persuasion, he has not yet taken retaliatory action against Shagewo in North Vietnam. It is reported that the mounted bandits who raided Shagewo left behind a coat, which, upon verification by relevant authorities, was found to be identical to those worn by the people of Outer Mongolia.</p>

<p>100,000 Respond to General Strike, Turmoil in Finland Intensifies</p>
<p>President Considers Partial Cabinet Reshuffle</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, 26th Broadcasting: Helsinki dispatch, Finnish President Paasikivi is reshuffling the cabinet in an effort to resolve the crisis caused by the strike initiated by the Communist Party. Paasikivi has appointed Kilpi (belonging to the People's Democratic Union front controlled by the Communist Party) as Minister of the Interior to succeed Laine. Heljas has been appointed as Minister of Education, and Laine's wife, who is the real leader of the Finnish Communist Party, has been appointed as Deputy Minister of Social Affairs. Responsible parties say that the strike caused by the Laine incident will be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基廿六日電〕(Reuters Helsinki, 26th)</p>
<p>The Action Committee of the People's Democratic Party announced that over 100,000 people in the Finnish capital responded today to the general strike called by the People's Democratic Party to force the government to appoint members of the party to the positions of Minister of the Interior and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. As of noon today, the turmoil has continued to escalate, with transportation workers engaging in slowdowns, threatening to bring transportation to a standstill. Independent and neutral opinions have begun to compare the current situation in Finland to the crisis in Czechoslovakia in February of this year. President Paasikivi convened a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss candidates to succeed the Minister of the Interior, but no agreement was reached. The President intended to give the position of Minister of the Interior to Minister of Education Kilpi or Prime Minister Pekkala, but both have refused. Kilpi had originally succeeded Laine as Minister of the Interior, but resigned after the People's Democratic Party launched a protest strike. Last night, 86 factories in Helsinki, 71 in Turku, 30 in Lahti, and 10 in Tampere were affected by the strike. The Action Committee of the People's Democratic Party also stated that workers at the Helsinki power plant were planning to join the strike, but were dissuaded by the committee. The committee further stated that until the cabinet issue is resolved, workers must be vigilant to prevent the Communist Party from suffering discrimination similar to that before the war, but the strike must be disciplined, all provocative actions must be suppressed, and assistance from the authorities must be requested when necessary. Furthermore, anti-Social Democratic Party officials in the Ministry of Labor also acknowledged that the strike action is gradually expanding throughout the country.</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基廿六日電〕(Reuters Helsinki, 26th)</p>
<p>President Paasikivi has ordered armed police riding express trains to protect workers who do not wish to participate in the strike. All government agencies are also guarded by armed police. At the same time, the Finnish cabinet is scheduled to hold another meeting this afternoon to find a suitable candidate for Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕(Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th)</p>
<p>Observers here today compared the current situation in Finland to the situation in Czechoslovakia during the coup in February, but pointed out that anti-communist forces are stronger in Finland than in Czechoslovakia. The Social Democratic Party, which holds a majority in Finnish labor unions, has resolved to oppose the Communist Party's strike action. One of the most serious aspects of the situation in Finland is not the demands put forward by the Communist Party, but the attitude and methods they used in making those demands. The Communist Party's organization, the "Action Committee," is reminiscent of the situation in Czechoslovakia at the time. The Communists in Helsinki are clearly trying to seize power in a "universally democratic" manner before the upcoming elections weaken their strength.</p>
<p>Arabs Insist on Annulment of Jewish State, Reply to Ceasefire Proposal Submitted Yesterday</p>
<p>Fiercest Battle Rages in Jerusalem</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lake Success Broadcasting, 26th: The Arab side's response to the Security Council's ceasefire proposal has arrived, but the contents have not yet been released. It is understood that the Arab side may accept the ceasefire proposal, but with three conditions: (1) Withdrawal of all recognition of the State of Israel; (2) Jews cease arming; (3) Restrictions on Jewish immigration into the Holy Land. The above three points are unacceptable to the Jewish side.</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lake Success Broadcasting, 26th: The Arab side insists that the Jewish state must be abolished and the Jewish army must be disbanded. Therefore, the Jewish side believes that it must reconsider its compliance with the Security Council's ceasefire order. In other words, the battle for the Holy Land will continue.</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York Broadcasting, 26th: Tel Aviv dispatch, Fierce fighting has been raging in the Holy City since dawn yesterday. Both Jewish and Arab forces are fighting with all their might. The Arab side launched a fierce attack, but was repelled by the Jewish side. The outcome of the battle is still uncertain.</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕(Reuters London, 26th)</p>
<p>Authoritative sources in Cairo reported that Egypt has notified the Security Council, stating that King Farouk of Egypt has decided to reject the Security Council's ceasefire proposal for Palestine. Reports from other Arab countries indicate that all Arab countries have decided to take the same action. Egypt's rejection is based on the rationale that the entry of Egyptian troops into Palestine is to restore peace and order and to maintain humanitarian principles. According to Egyptian officials in Cairo, the Arab rejection of the ceasefire is a unanimous action, and Egypt is not acting alone. A dispatch from Amman also reports that Arab leaders met again this morning at Abdulla Palace, and are expected to conclude by noon. The joint response of the Arab League countries to the Security Council's ceasefire proposal will then be released in a communique.</p>
<p>〔合衆社台拉維夫邪惡六日電〕(United Press Tel Aviv, Evil 6th)</p>
<p>Tel Aviv, 26th, received reports that the Arab and Jewish armies in Jerusalem have thrown all their forces into battle. The fiercest battle in the city's 2,000-year history is raging wildly among the ancient Christian sites. The battle began at dawn on the 25th, with Arab forces attacking the Damascus Gate and Rachel's Tomb from the north and south of Jerusalem. The war reached its peak on the evening of the 25th. A Haganah spokesman said that the ceasefire in the Jerusalem area had become ineffective because Arab forces attacked the Old City after the deadline, and it cannot be reimplemented without an order from the Israeli government. Rachel's Tomb was captured by Arab forces on the evening of the 25th after a fierce attack by Egyptian forces. Arab forces on all fronts have gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕(Reuters London, 26th)</p>
<p>Reports from the Holy Land over the past 24 hours indicate joy on the Arab side and pessimism on the Jewish side. Jewish forces in the Old City and the new city of Jerusalem have been surrounded by Arab forces. A British Broadcasting Corporation dispatch from Jerusalem said that Jewish forces in the Old City have been driven by Arab forces into a Jewish synagogue, where they have raised the banner of Israel, preparing to fight to the last man. The Arab forces have notified representatives of the International Red Cross, informing them that if the Jews in the synagogue do not surrender, the Arab forces will raze the synagogue to the ground with artillery fire. The Arab forces attacking the new city of Jerusalem have also made progress. Arab forces also said that the Arab army continued to win great victories on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. Jewish forces have been unable to rescue their comrades in Jerusalem. Arab aircraft also made their first sortie to bomb the Jewish forces in the new city of Jerusalem. The Transjordanian Legion fought fiercely with Jewish vehicles for 24 hours at Latrun on the road west of Jerusalem, killing more than 600 Jews. On the southern front of Palestine, the Egyptian army occupied the six southeastern peaks of Mamu Tair, thus cutting off the transportation line between Jewish forces and the Jewish areas of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Lebanon Agrees to Release Detained American Jews</p>
<p>But They Must Return Directly to America</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕(United Press Washington, 25th)</p>
<p>The State Department announced on the 25th that Lebanon has agreed to release the 41 American citizens arrested on American ships bound for Palestine, but they must return directly to America. A State Department spokesman did not comment on this proposal, but said that the American ambassador to Lebanon, Pinkerton, is seeking the opinions of the arrested Americans.</p>
<p>Marshall Consults with Austin Regarding New American Steps in the Holy Land</p>
<p>Britain to Issue Detailed Statement on the Situation in the Holy Land</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿五日電〕(Central News Agency Lake Success, 25th)</p>
<p>The U.S. Secretary of State had lunch with Austin, the chief U.S. representative to the United Nations, at his residence in New York today. It is rumored that they discussed new American steps regarding the Palestine issue. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie and Security Council President Parodi were also guests.</p>
<p>Although officials claim that the lunch was purely a casual social engagement, it is generally speculated that Marshall and Lie at least used this opportunity to informally exchange views on the Palestine issue. It is also believed that Marshall and Austin secretly agreed on the steps that the United States should take in the Security Council if the Arabs do not comply with the ceasefire order, which took effect at noon on the 26th. Although the Security Council's ceasefire deadline has been extended by 48 hours to allow Arab countries time to consult, observers here are largely pessimistic about the hope that the Arabs will fully obey the Security Council. This outlook has become even dimmer after an Arab spokesman here stated today that the Arabs will not agree to an unconditional ceasefire. If the conditions demanded by the Arabs include the previously insisted upon dissolution of the State of Israel, then the Security Council's final call for peace to the Arabs and Jews may be of no avail, and the Security Council will have to redouble its efforts.</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿五日電〕(United Press London, 25th)</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Bevin told the House of Commons on the 25th that he will issue a statement on the 26th regarding the status of British officers in Arab armies. Bevin also promised to issue a detailed statement on the situation in Palestine later. Opposition leader Churchill instructed Bevin to remember the importance of maintaining neutrality. Bevin replied, "I have done this and understand it well."</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕(United Press Washington, 25th)</p>
<p>Reliable diplomatic sources told this agency on the 25th that if the Arab and Jewish sides in Palestine do not declare a ceasefire, Britain is likely to prepare to allow the United Nations to repeal the British-Transjordanian Treaty.</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕(Reuters London, 25th)</p>
<p>The status of British officers serving in the Transjordanian Legion has always been a subject of credible discussion in London. There are a total of 40 such officers, including Brigadier Glubb, commander of the Arab Legion. Related parties believe that the British government's decision on this matter will depend on the Arab countries' rejection of the Security Council's ceasefire order. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that Britain will determine its Palestinian policy independently, without interference from any other country, and that there are no ongoing negotiations with other countries on this matter.</p>

<p>Japanese Opposition Parties Organize United Front to Overthrow Cabinet</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕(Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th)</p>
<p>The Democratic Liberal Party of Japan, which is "conservative," is working to unite with various opposition parties in parliament in an attempt to overthrow the Ashida cabinet.

It is heard that the united front of opposition parties is planning to launch an offensive against the current government when debating the controversial budget.</p>
<p>United States Expected to Implement Military Aid to Europe Plan Next Year</p>
<p>Total Funding Required Approximately Six Billion Dollars</p>
<p>〔細社羣 頓廿五日電〕(Detailed Community, 25th)</p>
<p>Democratic Senator George predicted to reporters today that Congress will debate and pass next year the Marshall Plan to provide Western European countries with armaments to help them resist the threat of communism, at a total cost of between $3 billion and $6 billion. George stated, "The timing of its implementation depends on who is elected president and the speed with which the new president promotes this matter. However, I am confident that Congress will pass a bill to arm Western Europe within the next year." He also said that the U.S. should assist in improving Britain's navy and strengthening its air force. France is severely lacking in military equipment and must be completely re-equipped. He believes that if the Senate can pass Vandenberg's regional defense resolution, Western European countries will not find it difficult to obtain the armaments needed under the regional defense system.</p>

<p>Britain Opposes U.S. Loans to Israel</p>

<p>New York Broadcasting, 26th: Washington dispatch, White House Press Secretary Ross told reporters today that the United States does not intend to "take immediate action" on the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the Near East. He declined to discuss the matter of U.S. loans to Israel.</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕(Reuters London, 26th)</p>
<p>A British Foreign Office spokesman said today that he believes President Truman's promise to lend to Israeli President Weizmann is untimely. The British government does not support any proposal that would encourage Arab countries to reject a ceasefire. The spokesman also revealed that the five Western European Union countries are consulting on the Palestine issue, and that the mutual connection of the foreign policies of the five countries is the principle of the Western European Union.</p>
<p>Three Powers Send Liaison Officers to Police Headquarters</p>
<p>Soviet Union Takes Threatening Attitude</p>
<p>Berlin Crisis Shows Signs of Revival</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿五日電〕(Reuters Berlin, 25th)</p>
<p>Colonel Yelisarov, Soviet Deputy Commander of the Berlin Sector, today took a threatening attitude in protesting to the military governments of Britain, the United States, and France about the dispatch of liaison officers to the police headquarters in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Colonel Yelisarov claimed at the Berlin Deputy Commanders' meeting that these liaison officers had not obtained any special permits and had unilaterally stationed themselves in the police headquarters of the Soviet sector. The Soviet authorities may have to take the necessary measures to end the abnormal situation caused by this, which is an act that undermines peace and order in the Berlin sector. Brigadier General Bensen, the British representative and chairman of the Deputy Commanders' meeting, said that it would be a very serious situation if the Soviet authorities threatened the British representative and intended to prevent him from entering any institution jointly managed by the four powers. He asked Yelisarov what measures he intended to take. Yelisarov said that he did not intend to express anything other than the opinions he had already expressed. Observers believe that the long-dormant so-called Berlin crisis is showing signs of revival. After the outcome of the London Six-Nation Conference becomes clear, and the Western countries have reached an agreement to establish a West German government, it is almost certain that the Soviet Union will force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin.</p>

<p>True Color Photography, New Method Invented by French</p>
<p>A Great Revolution Will Erupt in the Film Industry</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕(Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th)</p>
<p>French engineers, the Otis brothers, have studied true color photography for 17 years and have now invented a photographic method that is absolutely similar to real colors and is cheaper than any previous method. This new photographic method only requires a specially made lens, and other equipment is the same as black and white photography, and the film is the same as that commonly used. French filmmaker Bayour said that he will use this new method for his next film, "Miss Millstone." He said of the new invention: "This will bring a complete revolution to the film industry. Black and white films will disappear completely within the next two years, and forty-year-old women will no longer be able to play the roles of twenty-year-old girls."</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report on Aid to China (2)</p>
<p>The Plan Recommended by the State Department</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, it is difficult to formulate an effective long-term plan for China's economic recovery based on foreign aid from the United States. We must deal with the development of the situation step by step, as in all foreign aid plans. We must clearly state that our obligations are limited by the provisions of this bill.</p>
<p>Due to factual needs, this aid to China plan differs in several basic factors from the European Recovery Plan recently approved by the Senate. In Europe, it is possible to respond to American aid and make efforts for recovery and cooperation in a short period of time, but some of the basic factors of these efforts do not exist in the China plan. However, it is generally believed that this aid plan, aimed at meeting the most significant needs, will alleviate human suffering, give the hardworking Chinese people the opportunity to curb the rate of economic deterioration in China, and give the Chinese government another opportunity to launch a strong self-help plan. The committee believes that this plan is sufficient to encourage active democratic elements in China to "keep going."</p>
<p>The State Department's recommendation calls for providing $570 million in economic aid over a period of approximately 15 months ending June 30, 1949. Of this amount, $510 million will be used to meet the minimum level of necessary civilian goods imports, mainly food and raw materials, and the remaining $60 million will be used for important construction projects. This aid will enable China to use its own resources to procure other necessary imports and military supplies.</p>
<p>Detailed estimates and stipulations are not to be construed as obligations to China, but they are sufficient to provide a reasonable description of the scope of the plan. The plan must have sufficient flexibility and prudent management, as stipulated in the Economic Cooperation Act. The testimony made by the administrative department confirms that the needs and the possibility of obtaining such materials have been taken into account in this conceptual aid, and that providing such aid will not hinder the European Recovery Plan or the U.S. domestic economy.</p>
<p>A list of possible imports is as follows, the prices of which include costs, insurance premiums, and fees (prices are based on January 1, 1948): (1) Cereals (wheat and rice) $130,000,000, (2) Cotton $150,000,000, (3) Oil and oil products $110,000,000, (4) Fertilizer $30,000,000, (5) Tobacco $28,000,000, (6) Metals $24,000,000, (7) Medical supplies $5,000,000, (8) Coal $3,000,000, (9) Repair parts for existing important equipment $30,000,000. Total $510,000,000. This is equivalent to: wheat 225,000 tons, rice 451,300 tons, cotton 750,000 bales, oil and oil products 25,198,000 barrels, mainly from resources in the Eastern Hemisphere, with lubricating oils possibly being an exception.</p>
<p>Soluble fertilizers 40,000 short tons, obtained from North America.</p>
<p>Nitrogen fertilizers 411,100 short tons, South America supplying 32,100 short tons, Europe supplying 10,000 short tons, American tobacco 84,500,000 pounds, lead, zinc, aluminum, brass, and copper 17,588 metric tons, iron and steel (excluding scrap iron) 115,373 metric tons.</p>
<p>Repair parts for existing important equipment are also needed. The amount needed for each item is small, and in general, it will not cause serious problems.</p>

<p>Whether Shanghai People Love Their Country, Special Relief Donation is a Touchstone</p>
<p>Mayor Donates 500 Million Yuan from Wife's Art Exhibition Proceeds to Take the Lead</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕(Our Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Relief Donation Solicitation Committee invited responsible persons from various industry and commerce guilds and native-place associations for a discussion at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Guozhen stated that the solicitation of special relief donations in the Shanghai area will not be like the compulsory enforcement in Beiping, but will be based on the principle of voluntary donations, with a deadline of the end of June. The special donation is not a levy, and the donations are purely out of patriotism and a willingness to do good. Whether or not the names of the donors are published will be up to the donors. He hopes that the responsible persons of each guild and native-place association will persuade their members to donate separately, and submit a register of donors and the amount of donations to the committee before June 10, in order to complete the target of 85 trillion yuan in the shortest possible time. If the solicitation committee believes that there are omissions, it will ask for supplementary donations based on the detailed roster prepared after investigations from all parties. The roster will not be made public for the time being. Mayor Wu also announced on the spot that although he has no permanent property, in order to express his patriotism, he will donate 500 million yuan in legal tender from the foreign exchange earned by his wife (Ms. Huang Zhuoqun) at a recent art exhibition in Manila, to take the lead.</p>
<p>Those present at the meeting yesterday included solicitation committee members Pan Gongzhan, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiyu, Wu Kaixian, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng (represented by Tang Shichang), Fang Zhi, Qin Runqing, Li Shizeng, and responsible persons from various industry and commerce guilds and native-place associations, totaling more than 300 people. First, Wu Guozhen, who also served as chairman of the committee, explained the significance of the special relief donation, and then invited two commissioners, Jiang Yong and Liu Butong, specially dispatched by the central government to Shanghai to provide guidance, to address the meeting. Jiang Yong stated: The relief cause should have been fully implemented by the government. Due to the increasing number of refugees and the government's financial difficulties, it is unavoidable to ask social figures from various provinces and cities to donate generously to assist the government in completing this arduous task. At present, the victims are all people from rural villages or small counties. It is hoped that people from large cities, especially those with wealth in Shanghai, can do their best to provide relief out of compassion. Liu Butong said: History tells us that when most people have no food to eat or clothes to wear, a few people cannot live in peace for long. At present, wealth in China is concentrated in several major cities, and Shanghai is the largest city. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that powerful people in Shanghai can contribute all they have to the country. Liu also said that the first step in Shanghai's fundraising method is voluntary donation, and the second step may also take extraordinary measures. He believes that wealthy people in Shanghai will definitely donate willingly without the need to take extraordinary measures. If they have money but are unwilling to donate, they will inevitably lead to a situation where those with strength are unwilling to contribute.</p>
<p>Everyone Must Have the Spirit of Destroying Their Homes to Relieve the National Crisis</p>
<p>Li Shizeng, Fang Zhi, Wang Xiaolai, and Xu Jiguang also delivered speeches one after another. Li Shizeng hoped that society would solve all social problems. Fang Zhi hoped to have the spirit of destroying their homes to relieve the national crisis. Wang Xiaolai said that patriotism starts with each individual's love for their country, and this donation is a touchstone for whether Shanghai people love their country. Xu Jiguang said that the special relief donation is definitely not a levy, and its target is aimed at people, not industries. He hopes that representatives of each guild and native-place association will enthusiastically persuade their familiar members of their respective industries or native-place members to donate. In this severe situation where the military situation has not ended, there is no hope for improvement in industry and commerce. To end the military situation and improve industry and commerce, each industry should provide more assistance to complete this task.</p>
<p>Mayor's Initiative Received Applause</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu reported that voluntary donations in the city would be made freely before the end of June. After June, those who are on the planned roster but have not donated will be subjected to the next method. Donors donate purely out of patriotism, and it does not mean that those who donate have been corrupt or upstarts, so those who wish to publish their names will publish them, and those who wish to keep secrets will hide their names. Donors who have already donated in one industry will not be asked to donate again in other industries or native-place associations. Finally, Mayor Wu donated 500 million yuan to take the lead, and said that there may be 50,000 to 100,000 people in Shanghai who can donate 500 million yuan. He hopes that people will enthusiastically donate, winning warm applause from the participants. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>

(2) After the incident, Jinjinzhai spent 1.5 billion yuan in legal tender for the disaster victims to rebuild their houses, but the money was embezzled by the Baoliajia, Jiang Maoqi, and Tian Zhang. (3) When the disaster victims rebuilt their houses, Jiang and Li Suoping required two pecks of rice for a tiled house and one peck of rice for a thatched house before allowing construction. (4) Jiang's original house before the fire was a thatched house, but after the fire, he built four two-story western-style houses and one tiled house. Li's house before the fire was also a thatched house, but after the fire, he built two tiled houses. (5) Jiang and Li had both served in puppet positions before.</p>

<p>Investigation of Suspected Concealment of Bandits, Xuhui District Chief Humiliated</p>
<p>Cheng Shi, the district chief of Xuhui District, was forcibly arrested and humiliated by three unidentified persons at around 3 p.m. on the 24th. According to Cheng, at that time, a person wearing a Western suit who claimed to be surnamed Jin held a letter and said that there was a secret and he needed to talk outside. When he got outside, he saw two people waiting outside. One of them showed a pistol and threatened him to go with them. Cheng refused the illegal arrest by Jin and others and resisted, but because he was weak, Jin and others handcuffed him. While they were arguing, Director Zhang of the Xuhui Police Station arrived after hearing the news and took Jin and others to the station. Cheng also went with them. The station director then telegraphed the police headquarters and the civil affairs bureau for instructions. Subsequently, Section Chief Lu of the Civil Affairs Bureau arrived. After questioning Jin, it was learned that Jin was sent by the Zhejiang Provincial Police and Security Office to investigate whether Cheng had concealed bandits. He was not ordered to arrest him. Moreover, Jin and others did not notify the Civil Affairs Bureau according to legal procedures, but directly and arbitrarily arrested and insulted him, which was even more wrong. After Director Zhang and Section Chief Lu criticized him, Jin and others silently left. District Chief Cheng also said: (1) I am waiting for the authorities to investigate whether I have any bandit case. (2) I have been illegally arrested and innocently humiliated. In addition to reporting to my superiors, I will file a lawsuit according to law.</p>

<h3>Yang Mei Once Grabbed Fried Rice Candy; Dr. Peng Guangqin Expresses Doubt Over the Health Bureau's Urine Test Results</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 25th] Yang Mei now weighs 84 pounds, with an oral temperature of 92 degrees, unchanged from before. According to someone from Shi Gui: Senator She Deyi originally planned to bring Yang to Chongqing last November, but because Yang had grabbed fried rice candy from a roadside vendor en route, fearing ridicule, he delayed the trip until this year. Therefore, Director Li instructed Yang Mei today not to force herself to eat anything. However, as of 4:00 PM today, she still had not passed stool. Furthermore, according to Dr. Peng Guangqin, Director of the Chongqing Economic and Industrial Institute, he doubts the Health Bureau's urine test results for Yang Mei, believing that regardless of whether she eats or not, there should be protein detected. Also, the "oral temperature of 32.2 degrees" published on the 21st was a mistake for 92.2 degrees. Additionally, Yang's sputum contains glucose bacteria, and she has bad breath.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 26th] Yang Mei still weighs 84 pounds today and has still not eaten or passed stool.

Director Li has not yet made a final decision with Yang Sen regarding the next steps, including the selection of examining experts and equipment, but has promised to consider it.</p>
<h3>British Build Highway on the Border of Kang and Tibet; Sedia to Ningyu Line Scheduled for Completion by Year's End; Chongqing Pacification Headquarters Orders Kang and Yunnan Provinces to Collect Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 26th] Regarding the British surreptitiously building highways in the Kang-Tibetan border areas of Moluo, Ningyu, Bomi, etc., the Chongqing Pacification Corps has ordered Kang and Yunnan provinces to pay close attention and to find ways to collect evidence to serve as a basis for forceful negotiations. The Yunnan Provincial Government has also instructed the regional commissioner's office to order the neighboring governing bureaus of Defan, Gongshan, Fugong, Bijiang, and Lushui, which border Kang and India, to conduct thorough investigations and report details. According to confirmations from Lijiang, the highway being built from Sedia (a secret territory of India's Assam) has not yet reached Ningyu, and is currently being constructed northward from Walong, about 100 Chinese miles southwest of Ningyu. The conditions are that Tibetan merchants are allowed to transport 500 loads of wool and cloth from Sedia each year, and that the export of firearms, cotton yarn, medicine, and daily necessities is specially permitted with limited quantities. Furthermore, according to reliable sources: after the completion of the Sedia-Ningyu highway at the end of the seventh year, there are plans to extend it to Sang'ang in the northeast, and then northward to Qamdo. Passing through Bomi and Tatzog, it can reach Assam, so entering Tibet from India can bypass Yunnan. Tibetan official Dongma Ben had already gone to Sedia three months ago to negotiate. The Chongqing Pacification Headquarters considers this matter of great importance to national territorial sovereignty and national defense security, and has reported the details to the highest authorities. Furthermore, according to a merchant from Ningwalong in the Kang region: There is a small path from Ning that leads directly to India's Yuanyongli. The road is narrow and impassable for vehicles and horses. At Wulongdi, three days' journey from Ning, the British army has built a thatched house, surrounded by a mud wall with a ditch around it, and stationed more than forty Indian military officers and soldiers. In another location, six or seven days' journey from Ning, there is a large stone with inscriptions in English, Chinese, and Indian. The Chinese text reads, "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar?" The locals say this is the border between Kang and India.</p>

The main text of the judgment stated that "Songgu Yisheng violated international law during the war by killing non-combatants and should be executed." Songgu Yisheng was lawless and brutal during his tenure at the Songjiang Military Police Team, and countless local residents suffered from his poison. For example, on March 30th, he burned villager Lu Youchang to death in Youtou Ru and threw his body into the river.

After the victory, the families of the victims reported him and testified in court. Although the criminal tried to deny it, the evidence was conclusive and could not be refuted.

<h3>Increase in Foreign Exchange Settlement Figures from Designated Banks, Export Trade Gradually Showing Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to news from the Export Administration Commission: From the 1st to the 22nd of this month, the foreign exchange settlements for exports through designated banks in Shanghai alone have reached approximately 9.2 million US dollars. The settlement figures for other ports such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Taiwan, and Guangzhou are not included. Among them, fresh eggs, fruits, frozen eggs, and egg products are in peak season and account for a larger amount, totaling 2.6 million US dollars. Yarn and knitted goods totaled 1 million US dollars, tea totaled 900,000 US dollars, and leather goods, pork floss, and textiles totaled 500,000 US dollars. Therefore, there is no doubt that the total export settlement for this month will exceed that of April. If there are favorable factors in the next two weeks, it is possible to break the record for settlement figures in previous months, it is said.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Huo Baofeng, chairman of the Export Administration Commission, submitted his resignation a few days ago, stating that he had made little contribution since taking office and requested that another capable person be selected. At that time, there was no reply. It is generally speculated that this matter will need to be discussed after the cabinet is formed and the trade and foreign exchange policies are decided, before the Export Administration Commission can be reorganized.</p>
<h3>Sellers' Intentions Increase, Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Flour Prices Fall Again, Oil Market Rises</h3>
<p>The rice market continues to fall. Because production areas reported a significant drop in prices the day before, sellers' intentions are stronger. Moreover, the Civil Administration Commission is releasing 6,000 dan of rice per day, but actual sales are sluggish. Yesterday, there were formal transactions within the market, but they were all second-class old rice and indica rice, because of the price limit; high-quality goods were priced higher.</p>
<p>The market price in Beishi for white japonica and thin rice was 5.98 million yuan, and for white yuan, it was 7.5 million yuan, about 200,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The prices outside the market also fell again. High-quality white japonica initially sold for 6.2 million yuan, but later rose slightly to 6.3 million yuan. Thin rice and early rice fell by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan each. Registered arrivals at the market totaled 2,569 dan.</p>
<p>Flour prices fell again. The Central Trust Bureau's released flour price also decreased by 50,000 yuan, to 2 million yuan delivered. Old car, warship, and warehouse receipt transactions were more active. Initially opening at 2 million yuan, retail buyers and the northern gang took advantage of the low prices and raised it to 2.05 million yuan, reducing it by 50,000 yuan. Spot prices were lower than warehouse receipts by 30,000 to 70,000 yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng closed at 2 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour were actively cleared out in the streets and inland areas, with many transactions. Peacock closed at 2.06 million yuan. Bran fell by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains initially weakened but later strengthened. When soybeans initially opened, many sellers wanted to sell due to the large number of returns from the previous day, and early soybeans initially opened at a low of 3.2 million yuan. Later, bean cakes and oil prices rose, and factory buyers frequented the market, causing prices to rise to the original price of 3.35 million yuan, not much different from the previous day. Transactions of selected green beans were still rare, and prices were unchanged. As for corn, because the Yantai gang had ship positions, they absorbed a large amount, raising it by 200,000 yuan.

<h3>Japanese Reparation Machines Arrive Continuously, Processing and Allocation Prices Still Undecided</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Japanese reparation machines received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for allocation to private factories, since the first batch arrived on January 22 this year via the Haikang wheel, have continued to arrive in ten batches via the Haizhe, Yongxing, Huzhou, Limin, Changli, Haiji, and Haisu wheels. To date, a total of 1,446 pieces of large and small machines have arrived in port. It is expected that four more batches will arrive before the end of June this year. Then, the first phase of the reception work can be concluded. The deadline for factories to apply for allocation and pricing was April 15 this year, but there is still no news on the handling method. The machines have been shelved for too long, and there is concern about rust. The reporter inquired about the details with the responsible department of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday. It is reported that the machines are packed well. The inner layer of the wooden boxes is lined with tar paper, and the surface of the machines is coated with butter. Heavy machinery is piled outdoors, covered with tarpaulins, and padded with sleepers to shield it from wind and rain. This waterproofing equipment can generally last for six months. However, some machines were delayed while awaiting shipment in Japan. Now, if the storage period is too long, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no rust. However, the Guidance Office, limited by funds, is already struggling with storage, handling, and loading and unloading costs. If there is rust, it will be helpless. Fortunately, when inviting people from all walks of life to visit last time, 20 boxes of machines were opened, and there was no rust. Therefore, it is speculated that even if there is rust, it should be a very small number. On the one hand, the Ministry's handling of the Japanese Reparation Committee is also expediting the review. After all, the first batch of machines totals only 1,601 pieces, but more than 10,000 pieces have been applied for allocation by various factories, which takes time to review. However, it is expected that there will be results in the middle of next month, so that the allocation and processing can be carried out successively.</p>

<h3>New Law Schools Do Not Differentiate Departments; Schools Should Not Regard Them as One Department; Operating Expenses and Allocation Quotas Must Not Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Education recently telegraphed National Zhejiang, Tongji, and Lanzhou Universities, stating that many schools, because the new law schools do not differentiate departments, regard them as one department and reduce the allocation of funds, which defeats the purpose of concentrating efforts and developing legal education. The law schools adopt a non-departmental system, specializing in legal studies, which should be the same as the non-departmental system of medical schools. They should not be regarded as one department. In the future, the allocation of operating expenses to the law schools of each school should be based on the school, not calculated as one department, and the allocation quota should not be reduced in order to emphasize legal education.</p>

<h3>Alumni of National Teachers College in Beijing and Shanghai Send Letters to Kang Xinyuan to Dissuade Him from Taking Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Teachers College was established by Liao Shicheng in Lantian, Anhua, Hunan in 1937. After the victory of the War of Resistance, it moved to Nanyue.

In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Education to withdraw the appointment, they also went on strike to protest. The alumni associations in Beijing and Shanghai recently sent a letter to Kang dissuading him. The original letter is as follows: "We have just learned that the Ministry of Education has appointed you as the president of our college, which is unexpected and deeply surprising. Before you take office, we would like to express a few opinions to you: (1) You specialize in chemical engineering and have never been involved in teacher education, and you are completely unfamiliar with our college. If you take office rashly, will you be able to continue to promote the college's excellent traditions? (2) You are from Nanyue, and there are rumors that you intend to keep our college permanently in your hometown. This is contrary to the consistent position of all teachers and students of our college to 'move to Beijing and change the name to university.' If you take office and hinder the development of the college, how can you feel at ease? (3) Currently, the teachers and students of the college have gone on strike to express their rejection of your appointment. If you disregard the facts and affect the future of the college, how will you face the teachers and students of our college? Our association loves our college and cares about the future of teacher education in our country. Therefore, we put forward the above three points, and we hope you will consider them carefully."</p>

<h3>Donghua Unleashes Its Power, Defeating the British Navy Five to One; Allied Forces Suffered a Miserable Defeat</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Donghua football team unleashed its superb and powerful strength yesterday, defeating the Allied Forces team five to one. The team comprised ships from the British London and the Lucus. By half time, Donghua was dominating with a four to one lead. This score is noteworthy as the first match for the British Navy.</p>
<p>East Park was extremely crowded, with about 5,000 people. The referee was Li Guoyi, and the linesmen were Yue Xiuying and Wang Chongye.</p>
<p>Donghua Played Splendidly: Donghua worked very hard and played splendidly. Goalkeeper Chen Huimin saved dangerous balls, bravely and agilely, and is a promising talent. Because Donghua's defense was strong, the British forward's mobility was greatly reduced. Midfielder Han Nibo was good at both offense and defense. The intense offensive shooting from forwards Chen Mingzhe, Han Longhai, and Li Yao was Donghua's best performance in many days. The British Navy was busy defending, and the offensive power of its forwards was greatly reduced. The whole line was chaotic, and there was no good communication, which was much worse than the previous day. Except for center-back Xuegesi, there was little to admire.</p>
<p>A Draw: Donghua attacked first. After about ten minutes of melee, British center-back Xuegesi touched the ball with his hand. Old Sun took the penalty, but his shot went wide. Soon after, Youliang went deep, and Mao Shiman forced a corner kick. Youliang kicked it, and Li Yao, with perfect positioning in front of the goal, scored the first goal. The British army counterattacked. Griffin charged alone, and Chen Huimin rushed out. Griffin kicked and shot, hitting Chen's foot. Ford dribbled the ball and passed to the center, and Hatcher low-shot into the net, leveling the score at one to one.</p>
<p>Three Consecutive Goals: Donghua attacked again. Chen Mingzhe dribbled the ball quickly, and Mei Taisi intercepted it carelessly, injuring his ankle, and Lin Mansi replaced him. After 25 minutes, Youliang passed to Han Nibo, who fired a long shot from 25 yards out, scoring another goal. Two minutes later, Mingzhe got the ball and passed to Youliang, Jia Tiao and A Sun, made a cross, and Li Yao forcibly shot the ball from the baseline, making it three to one. At half an hour, Longhai charged into the middle like a horse unleashed. By half time, Donghua was dominating with a four to one lead.</p>
<p>Longhai Dangles</p>
<p>After the break, Zhang Lingen replaced Qia Xing, and Zhuang Youren and Jin Chuanhan came on the field. The British army's situation was more stable than before, and the counterattack was strong, but the shooting was inaccurate, wasting effort. Until the 28th minute, Youliang launched an attack from the wing and made a wonderful pass to the center. Longhai made a backward hooking shot, hooking the ball into the net, making it five to one, and Donghua sent the British Navy packing. The British Navy had originally planned to play friendly matches with Jiaotong University, etc., but because it had to leave Shanghai for Taiwan today, it gave up.</p>

<h3>British Navy Experiences Multiple Misfortunes, Suffers a Defeat of Eight to One; Cultural Exchange: Xu Hui's Little Luo Displays Courage, Scores Five Goals Alone</h3>
<p>The Xu Hui High School soccer team played against the British Navy's HMS London soccer team at the Xu Hui field at 4:00 PM yesterday. Commander Lin Hui of HMS London represented Commander-in-Chief Bao Yide in performing the opening kickoff ceremony. Former Xu Hui players Zhuang Wenquan, Luo Shoufu, and Gu Yisa all returned to the team to serve, making their strength even more abundant. After the start of the match, Little Luo opened the scoring first, followed by Xu Zuguo adding another goal. The British sailors lost two goals in a row and tried hard to counterattack, but Xu Hui's defense was impregnable, and their efforts were in vain. Soon, Li Shunsheng penetrated deep on the right wing and scored a goal. When Little Luo scored again, the first half ended, with Xu Hui leading by four goals.</p>
<p>After changing ends, Xu Hui replaced Liu Chengmin with Zhen Deren. The British Navy made no changes. After contact, Xu Hui's Little Luo became more and more courageous, scoring two more goals in a row. The British soldiers were unwilling to give in and the forwards advanced, attacking relentlessly. Finally, the center forward recovered one goal, but the Xu Hui youngsters maintained their remaining strength, and Little Luo and Xu Zuguo each scored a bullseye in succession. When time ran out, Xu Hui won a big victory with a score of eight to one. Xu Hui's lineup was as follows:</p>

<h3>From Ideological Transformation to Political Reform: Reading "Thought, Morality, and Politics" by Hu Qiuyuan, Published by New China Publishing House</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>The eight-year War of Resistance only yielded a fleeting victory. The post-victory scene was one of internal strife and destruction, the complete opposite of what was expected, causing many to feel deeply distressed. Many people put forward ideas for improvement, in all sorts of forms and varieties. Mr. Hu Qiuyuan's proposal to proceed from the ideological and moral aspects to political reform is indeed a profound and unique perspective.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu recently compiled his 29 essays into a volume entitled "Thought, Morality, and Politics," which represents his views. The book is divided into three units: eight articles on thought, seven on morality, and fourteen on politics. Each article can be read independently, but from the book as a whole, there is a consistent system, and there is no lack of coherence.</p>
<p>Regarding thought, the author advocates freedom, so he begins with thought and freedom and ends with neo-liberalism. He discusses the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western thought, their characteristics, and the evolution of Chinese thought after being influenced by Western thought in the past century, pointing out the contradictions. The author believes that thought is the driving force behind all actions, and the transformation of thought is the foundation of all reforms. Rational and free thought can restore our clear wisdom. Neo-liberalism is the path to ideological reform. Hu's neo-liberalism combines movement, evolution, and creation into one, developing the original performance from historical evolution and natural activities. This original performance is the most virtuous and reasonable, without harming others or other things. If the inherent performance of human beings can be fully developed, society can move towards progress, and the world can achieve peace.</p>
<p>From free thought, he proposes a new moral creed of "establishing oneself and establishing others, achieving oneself and achieving others," which is the center of the author's discussion of morality. Thought is personal, morality is social. In today's China, the old morality is declining, and the standards of the new morality have not yet been established, resulting in the chaotic phenomenon of today. Originally, morality does not distinguish between old and new. As long as the value and dignity of morality are restored, the light of human nature is restored. What counts as virtue? Mr. Hu only put forward four simple words: "diligence" and "courage" are the elements of tempering oneself, and "benevolence" and "sincerity" are the foundation of treating others. Being able to possess four virtues is the way to be a person, which is the way to succeed. Especially for young people, in addition to having a good foundation of knowledge, they must also have character cultivation, which is the original capital for career success.</p>
<p>Finally, discussing politics, many people now take old or misunderstood ideas as a starting point for their views on politics, and use secular and unreasonable moral standards as rules. This is why internal strife in China and contradictions in the international community have arisen. Hu proposes that rebellion has political factors, so suppression must be carried out through both military and political means in order to eliminate the source of the chaos. The transformation of politics must have a basis, it is necessary to understand the background of history, to understand the international situation, and at the same time to establish the goal of nation-building, so that political reform can be effective. The author proposes that the current political reform in China should take "winning people's hearts and establishing prestige" as the basic principle. Make the people have confidence in the government, and obtain the cooperation of the people of the whole country, so that the war will gradually shrink and order will gradually be restored.</p>
<p>Political reform is not a matter for one or two people, but the result of the joint cooperation of the people of the whole country. To enable everyone to engage in this arduous work, it is necessary to start with the ideological and moral reform of each individual. Now that the constitutional government has just been established, I would like to introduce this book to every young person, so that young people can transform themselves ideologically and morally, and then jointly engage in political reform. Then the turning point of the fate of the Chinese nation can be expected to arrive.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Modern Academic Culture</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Edited by Zhu Kezhen et al., Edited by Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Published by Huaxia Book Company, Price: Six Yuan</p>
<p>According to the author's preface to "Introduction to Modern Academic Culture," it will be divided into four parts: (1) Humanities, (2) Social Sciences, (3) Natural Sciences, (4) Applied Sciences. The first volume, published in March this year, is now being introduced. This book includes ten essays, written by professors from various universities. Mr. Zhu Kezhen's "The Method and Spirit of Science" has a thoughtful conclusion that is thought-provoking and worthy of being the authority of the scientific community. He said: "Love of peace is a characteristic of the Chinese people, and the more developed science is, the more狰狞 and terrible war becomes, and the more the world has to achieve peace. How can we make the future world continue to develop science on the one hand, and achieve peace on the other hand? This is a very serious problem at present, and it is also a problem that our Chinese should make special contributions to." Mr. He Lin's "Confucian Thought" believes that the characteristic of Chinese culture is still Confucian thought, or Neo-Confucian thought. The proposition seems old, but it is actually novel. His views are similar to those of Mr. Feng Youlan in his book "New 理学," not aiming to be innovative or different. Is Mr. He's "New Theory of Confucian Thought," recently published by Zhengzhong Book Company, an expansion of this article? Because I haven't seen it yet, I dare not speculate. Mr. Zhu Guangqian's "Modern Chinese Literature" is slightly brief, but his conclusion is correct. He said: "The import of Western influences has made Chinese literature face a very serious problem, which is tradition. It can be said that our new literature is inheriting Western traditions, while neglecting China's inherent traditions. Mutual influence is a necessary phenomenon of cultural exchange. It is inevitable and natural for Chinese literature to accept Western influences. However, completely abandoning inherent traditions, history will prove that this is not clever..." He also said: "Our new literature is still in its infancy, we are still groping for the way, we must learn humbly, try more broadly, and work more firmly." Mr. Zhu is an authority in the Chinese literary world. His "Poetry Theory" and the articles criticizing Tao Yuanming are all insightful works. What is contained in this short article is also not small. However, we hope that Mr. Zhu can have more narratives and criticisms of current Chinese literature to benefit future generations. Other works by Mr. Zhang Qiyun, Zhang Yinlin, Xie Youwei... are all qualified to be said in the preface of this book. "The purpose is to inspire students' interest in various disciplines, indicate their pathways, and explain their methods." Therefore, I dare to introduce it to high school students and above as extracurricular reading material.</p>
<h3>Rousseau's Educational Thought</h3>
<p>— Li Rongru</p>
<p>"Rousseau's Educational Thought" Edited by Teng Dachun, Published by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, Distributed by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau of the eighteenth century was a great and epoch-making thinker. Relying on his keen and profound observations and passionate personality, he bravely raised the banner of resistance against the then French society under the control of traditional civilization. His most powerful masterpieces, "The Social Contract" and "Emile," provided some very novel insights. There is no doubt that the decadent and corrupt society at that time was greatly shaken. From "The Social Contract," we can know Rousseau's political ideals. He said: "Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains." He also said: "Despotic regimes do not rule the people to make them happy; but to impoverish them in order to rule them." From these passionate words, we can see his indignation and hatred for despotic regimes. The French Revolution that followed soon after was clearly inspired by Rousseau's thought. Representing his educational thought is the great work "Emile." In that era, the entire education system and facilities were shrouded in the spirit of obsolete and irrational. The importance of individual development was obliterated by using traditional customs, habits, dogmas, etc. to force and bind individuals, which was all against nature. Genius was shackled, individuality was destroyed, and individuals became slaves of dogma. In response to these malpractices, Rousseau raised his arms and shouted the slogan "Return to Nature," vigorously advocating natural education, attempting to liberate individuals from the shackles of education that harms human nature. The theories and practices of modern new education mostly come from the inspiration of his thought. In Europe and the United States, there are many scholars engaged in the study of Rousseau's works. Although Chinese people have some fragmentary introductions to this, there has indeed been a lack of systematic and rigorous discussions in the past. Today, Mr. Teng Dachun has collected various relevant materials and compiled the book "Rousseau's Educational Thought," objectively commenting on Rousseau's entire educational thought, so that readers can get a glimpse of its outline. I recently read the book again and felt that its content was barely satisfactory. I feel that it is necessary to recommend it to readers.</p>
<p>This book is divided into twelve chapters. The first chapter discusses Rousseau's life, dividing his life into three stages: the stage of capacity accumulation, the stage of writing, and the stage of exile, and describing them in sections. Secondly, there is a detailed description of the personality aspect. The first and second chapters can help readers to understand the clues of his thought more deeply, which is the greatest contribution of this book. The third chapter discusses "Return to Nature," which is the center of Rousseau's thought. What is "nature"? The author of this book has a very profound interpretation of its meaning. The fourth chapter discusses "Natural Man," which can be regarded as Rousseau's ideal educational objective theory. The fifth chapter discusses "development." The concept of development is very important in education. All facilities should be coordinated with the process of children's physical and mental development. Rousseau valued "development" most, which was indeed a novel view in Western Europe at that time. Chapters six, seven, eight, nine, and ten respectively describe the implementation methods of physical education, sensory education, knowledge education, moral education, and religious education, which is his educational method discussion. The eleventh chapter details Rousseau's views on women's education. The last chapter is your criticism of Rousseau's entire educational thought.</p>
<p>What Rousseau is most criticized for by the world is his opinion on women's education; and his extreme contempt for national education and vocational education. The author of this book believes that: "Rousseau was a man of great talent, and the most romantic temperament, too passionate, too sensitive, and happened to be in an old era, and happened to have experienced a sad life. His anger at the world, his complaints, his shouts, his roars, are all reasonable." In order to break through the shackles of old education, it is inevitable that there will be places where he is too extreme in his discussions. But his contribution to modern new education cannot be completely denied, such as: "The creation of the children's welfare movement," "The creation of life education," and "The advocacy of child-centered education." These are all unique insights. He is indeed worthy of being an enlightener of modern times. Mr. Teng, based on his life, personality, and historical background, speaks for Rousseau from his point of view, which is reasonable and can eliminate general misunderstandings. This is a point worthy of attention.</p>
<p>There are three advantages of this book: (1) The writing is fluent. Looking at the description of the text in the book as a whole, there is a sense of flowing water, giving readers a fresh and pleasant impression. (2) The viewpoint is fair and objective, not influenced by traditional prejudices. According to objective and credible information, the book comments on Rousseau's educational thought. (3) The structure is rigorous, the levels are clear, and it has the magic of attracting people. As for its shortcomings, there are naturally also, the main ones are two: (1) At the end of each chapter, there is no related reference book, which is very inconvenient for readers to study further. (2) Regarding the theory of sex education, Rousseau has a very detailed exposition in Emile. The discussion of this aspect in this book is inevitably too brief, which is a fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this book is still a book worth reading, this point I can guarantee responsibly.</p>
<h3>Knowing Our Friendly Nation: India—After Reading "Indian Science"</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>The relationship between China and India cannot be compared with the relations with other countries. Cultural exchange and mutual sympathy have made it so that there is no conflict of interest between these two old brothers that are recovering, but rather a fraternal relationship. But regrettably, in terms of the understanding of this great friendly nation, especially regarding her efforts and achievements in scientific construction, we dare to declare that it is extremely insufficient. Therefore, we especially introduce Professor Liu Xian's "Indian Science" (published by Zhengzhong Book Company) to domestic scientific workers. From this systematic book on Indian science, we will not only have a deeper understanding of our old friendly nation, but also, from their century-long experience of exploration, we can find a healthy path that China should follow in engaging in scientific construction.</p>
<p>Professor Liu Cheng introduced Indian science in four topics: (1) Ancient Indian science; (2) Indian science before the twentieth century; (3) Indian science in the twentieth century; (4) Indian scientific publications and experts. Moreover, the author believes that "the British Empire's education policy after annexing India had a great impact on Indian science," so there is also a special review of the British government's education administrative policies after 1757.</p>
<p>Before the twelfth century, the activeness of India in academic thought was very similar to the contention of a hundred schools of thought in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of China. At this time, they had already made achievements in science, such as the invention of Arabic decimal numerals (not invented by the Arabs), and Bhaskara's brilliant contribution to algebra in 1112. But the revival of Brahmanism suppressed this vitality with one hand; it was not until the annexation of the British Empire in the eighteenth century that Indians were able to freely pursue science again. This is very similar to the domineering style of Confucianism in the Western Han Dynasty of China.</p>
<p>Before the twentieth century, Indians were still learning behind closed doors in science. Once they entered the twentieth century, which Westerners called the "century of awakening of the Orientals," they began to bear brilliant flowers. The expansion and increase of scientific institutions, and the emergence of scientific celebrities are enough to show that their cultivation has begun to bear fruit. Among them, the greatest achievements are mathematics, theoretical physics, electrochemistry, colloid chemistry, astrophysical science, botanical morphology, and paleobotany. The achievements of many outstanding scientists have not only made the world re-evaluate the intelligence and ability of the Indian nation, but also restored their self-confidence. Therefore, among the three most admired Indian saints, the scientist Sir Chandra Bose is one saint; the other two saints are Gandhi and Tagore, who are well known to the world. Sir Bose's greatest achievements are in theoretical physics and botany, such as the Boss-Einstein Statistics, which is his discovery.</p>
<p>The first, and so far the only, Oriental to win the Nobel Prize in Science (the literary prize won by the Indian writer Tagore does not count) is the Indian physicist Dr. Venkata Raman. The most famous "Raman effect" in spectroscopy is his proud discovery. Many Indian scientists became famous at a young age, and most of them were not from the aristocracy, but completely fought their way out of poverty. For example, many of Dr. Raman's papers were written while he was a small clerk in the Indian Ministry of Finance. Srinivasa Ramanujun, the most talented mathematician with the highest attainments in number theory, was not highly educated but was a small doctor's assistant in a trust company, but he persevered in overcoming difficulties, which ultimately gave them the opportunity to exert their wisdom. Compared to China, India's social class, religious influence, language, and the disparity between the rich and the poor are all deadly enemies of the development of science, but they have overcome them; this is somewhat encouraging to Chinese scientific workers who are struggling in hardship today.</p>
<p>The original author believes that the reason why Indian science has the status it has today is not only due to the hard work of Indian scientists, but also because "various societies have played a huge role," so he used a lot of space to introduce the many scientific societies and scientific activities of universities in India today. The colonial policy implemented by the British Empire in India was "curseable," but their assistance to Indians in establishing scientific institutions and greatly expanding university education is worth celebrating. For example, the Indian Science Congress, which was founded in 1911, is attended by the world's leading scientists every year. Its scale and atmosphere are "incommensurate" with the poverty of the Indian people, but the Indian government "does its best to support science" under any circumstances, so they can hold many meaningful scientific activities.</p>

<h3>Reading "A Coward"</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Just as the translator Li [omitted character] stated: "The greatest feature of this book is the author's realistic approach to the subject matter. These scenes of grappling with real life are simple and clear. It is no accident that Gorky ascended to the highest peak of the world's literary scene with this book; it was no stroke of luck."</p>
<p>Indeed, this world-class literary giant presents us with a vivid portrayal of Russian society under the Tsarist regime. In particular, the protagonist Foma seems to be born, to grow, and even to become a fool before our very eyes, smiling darkly and desolately. His character is so prominent.</p>
<p>From here, from this massive work of six hundred and sixty pages, we clearly see the lives of Russian nobles, merchants, officials, laborers, intellectual workers, women, and prostitutes, all meticulously depicted by the author's powerful pen. Throughout the book flows an unchanging, dense, and melancholic vitality, like sunlight obscured by layers of dark clouds, allowing people to feel intense heat even under a gloomy sky.</p>
<p>In Gorky's works, boundless maturity and power are often hidden. "A Coward" is no exception.</p>
<p>Foma, the son of a wealthy merchant, is described as follows:</p>
<p>"He seemed to be expecting something—as if something obscured his eyes. His deceased mother lived in the same way, groping in the dark."</p>
<p>Foma was indeed groping in the dark, he was indeed expecting something, although even he himself did not understand what he was expecting. Real life relentlessly pushed him, causing him to involuntarily embark on a narrow path that even he could not see clearly. A narrow path leading to destruction.</p>
<p>The author uses the most concise metaphors, writing with sharp precision to convey extremely profound meanings. When Foma wails after his father's death, his godfather, a more greedy and treacherous merchant, says to him lightly and mysteriously:</p>
<p>"You are now the commander-in-chief on the front lines. You should bravely command your soldiers. Your soldiers are rubles. You have many soldiers, you must fight incessantly!"</p>
<p>His father, his aunt, his godfather, Lubov, [omitted character] Ya, these many people, either taught him how to understand life or complained about it.</p>
<p>"What does this all mean?" he wondered. "If people are not life, then what is life? People always talk as if life is something else… This thing hinders people's existence, perhaps it is the devil!" A terrifying feeling rushed towards this young man.</p>
<p>Only the desolation and silence of the streets could answer him.</p>
<p>Thus, like the children of wealthy people in general, he squandered large amounts of time in gambling and drinking.</p>
<p>Everyone, like him, became wildly joyful, all were assaulted by the same black wave, and then carried away like garbage. All these people, like him, were afraid to look ahead, afraid to see clearly where the surging waves would take them. They drowned their terror in wine and meat, rushing forward in the rapid current, struggling, shouting, doing meaningless things, playing the fool, yelling, yelling, but never finding joy.</p>
<p>Foma was unknowingly swept away by the waves in this way. When he saw others laboring hard, he also thought about his own strength. But it was of no use.</p>
<p>Thus, the days were muddled and wasted.</p>
<p>Three years later, he wandered back, "looking exhausted, shabbily dressed, his mind clouded, often drunk, his brow furrowed, his head hanging on his chest, appearing very gloomy."</p>
<p>Yes, Foma himself explained the reason for this:</p>
<p>"…I am finished because of blindness, I see too little, so I have become as blind as an owl—."</p>
<p>Using Foma's life as the warp and the social background of the time as the weft, the author interweaves them to dissect the true lives and inner souls of various people for us.</p>
<p>The author only gives us a mass of un-enlightened fire, a gloomy and mixed picture of the human world, but from this, the reader is enlightened. We gain life lessons from here, and we will therefore choose and create the right path, and step onto the road to truth. Bless those who seek truth. Bless the giants of humanity.</p>

<h3>A Collection of Letters Seeking Soldiers</h3>
<p>(1) To the Editor: I am a rustic villager. My wife and I are both over sixty years old. We have an only son named Qiu Xin, courtesy name Yifen. In the 26th year of the Republic, he served in the Salt Affairs Tax Camp Guerrilla Team. In the 28th year, he was transferred to the Police Academy for training. Afterwards, he successively served as the captain of the 80th Propaganda Team, adjutant of the 8th Army Guerrilla Headquarters, team leader of the first detachment, fourth squadron, third battalion, ninth company, and first county detachment. At that time, he was stationed in Zhong'erwei, Chengang, [omitted character]shui County, which is the place of his last letter. Sadly, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we wandered from place to place, experiencing all the suffering of life. Now we barely survive, hoping to see my son again. Even if he has sacrificed himself for the country, we hope to get definite information, so that we can close our eyes in peace. Knowing that your newspaper is enthusiastic about serving society, I dare to ask you to disclose this letter. If we can get his classmates, colleagues, or relatives to tell us his whereabouts, we will repay you with gratitude even in death! Respectfully, Qiu Xiangtao (Address: [omitted character] Zhuan, Changtian City, Pingjiang, Hunan)</p>
<p>(2) To the Editor: Han Jinshui, a native of Yiqiao, [omitted character]shan County, Zhejiang, was conscripted into the army thirteen years ago and there has been no news since. Han's father has passed away, but his mother is still alive, living in Yiqiao with his brother, Zenglin, eagerly awaiting news. I respectfully request that your column disclose this information. If any friends of Jinshui know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Sanhe Oil Candle Shop, Yiqiao. Great thanks!</p>
<p>(3) To the Editor: My uncle, Zhuang Hengjian, courtesy name Jingtang, is a native of Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province. He has been in the army for more than ten years without returning.

<h3>Perseverance</h3>
<p>— Ti Zhai</p>
<p>Although Xunzi's Exhortation to Learning says, "If you carve and give up, rotten wood will not break; if you carve without stopping, metal and stone can be cut," few people truly do this in learning. Therefore, after nearly a century of universities and thousands of middle schools, the number of scholars, calculated by the product of time and space, is still too small. This proves that scholars have failed to persevere and that talent is rare and difficult to find.</p>
<p>But those who truly persevere are not students, but merchants' advertisers. Coca-Cola's splash with fifty billion (equivalent to three thousand U.S. dollars, or ten thousand pre-war national currency) at the National Games is a given. But in my own observations, many very small businessmen have imitated this. Sometimes, even we who distrust advertisements can't help but fall into the trap. I travel to and from Suzhou every week for teaching. There's a fellow selling locks at the Suzhou train station, dressed in a uniform and hat like a train station employee. Thirty minutes before the train departs, he gives a lecture in the train car about common sense for train travel, such as keeping your ticket safe, sending people off early, and distributing tickets when walking together, as well as the weather getting hotter and not throwing cigarette butts randomly. At first, I praised the train station's thoughtful service, listening carefully. Many elderly people nodded and praised it as a rare kindness in a chaotic world. But then things went wrong. He went from touring Tiger Hill and Lingyan to luggage and bags, and then to locks, describing the importance of locks. Then, he took out a handful of small locks, describing their springiness, and promoting them as domestic products, saying they were displayed at a certain company on Nanjing Road—who knows!—but said he wasn't selling them, just introducing them. This created a good smokescreen, reducing people's aversion to fly-by-night businesses. Later, he took out six safety pins, also for introduction. Like this, a sewing needle in a small glass bottle, a copper toothpick, a few scattered items. Finally, he said they were all gifts, and if anyone wanted to buy a lock, he would give them away at half price, and give away these gifts universally, etc. The value gradually increased from about twenty thousand to thirty or forty thousand. At this time, there were still more than ten minutes before departure, and he actually sold two or three dozen. Every week I must respectfully listen to this man's lecture once, and people buy every time. There are so many people in China, and few feel it is repetitive besides me. The effectiveness of advertising may lie in its insistence.</p>
<p>Are the neon lights and radios in big cities not examples of this? Our senses have almost invisibly lost their freedom. The success of things in the world sometimes depends on the needs of the other party, sometimes on the preferences of the other party, which is not surprising. Some are due to the other party's annoyance, which we did not expect. I once saw this point in seeking a job. An old notebook records that a certain official sent a concubine to a powerful minister, naming her after himself. The recipient was inevitably surprised. The gift-giver explained it well: "I hope that the Grand Master will remember the humble official's name whenever he uses her, and the humble official will benefit greatly!" This is the application of advertising to personal affairs. We have to remember their names precisely because we don't want to hear cigarette advertisements or see toothpaste neon lights.</p>
<p>It is said that when trams first appeared in Shanghai, there was an advertisement on the trams: "Everyone can sit." This is an utterly honest advertisement. All honest advertisements are fundamentally unnecessary. So, I have never heard of trams or buses advertising except to announce price increases. Rice shops and salt shops also have no need for this. However, there is sometimes a danger to people's lives when milling rice and oil. This is truly incomprehensible: the more it is needed, the less it is said; the less it is needed, the more it is desperately pushed into our ears! Of all the talents in the world, only Liu Bei goes to invite Zhuge Liang. There is no reason for Zhuge Liang to post a job advertisement. If Liu Bei really didn't know about Zhuge Liang, it is Liu Bei's responsibility and cannot be blamed on Zhuge Liang for not advertising.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't want people to post job advertisements, but we very much hope that rice shops, oil and salt shops, or trams and buses will advertise with big price cuts.</p>
<h3>How to Watch Opera?</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>What I call watching opera refers to Peking opera. I think: first, don't think that people today are not as good as the ancients. Chen Delin (Lanfang's teacher) singing a few lines is certainly better than Lanfang, but in terms of the entire opera's art, Lanfang is really surpassing his teacher. Among the current old male roles, several famous actors, such as Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying, are certainly not comparable to the former Tan Xinpei. But in terms of female roles, Dr. Mei's current position is really better than before, equivalent to the position that the old Tan had in male roles in the past. He can be called the "King of the Opera World" without objection.</p>
<p>Second, watching opera should look at the inside, not just at the superficial surface. Of the people who watch Dr. Mei's opera in Shanghai, eight or nine out of ten say that Lanfang is old and not as good as before. My view is the opposite. I think now is Lanfang's best time, because he has reached the realm of perfection. For example, in the opera "Royal Stele Pavilion," Meng Yuehua has several running scenes, and several movements with the water sleeves are really extremely beautiful. Lanfang used to be unable to express his inner feelings outwardly when performing, and to depict the characters in the play to the extreme. Most people in Shanghai who watch opera have a fault, they must watch operas like "Drunken Concubine," "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest," and "Farewell My Concubine" when watching Dr. Mei's opera. In fact, operas like "Royal Stele Pavilion" are also excellent! A true famous actor has his own unique and irreplaceable brilliance, no matter what opera he sings.</p>
<p>The above is only in terms of the art of opera, and not to write a biography for Dr. Mei; (Dr. Mei also does not need me to promote him.) Forty years ago, when I was studying in the old capital, I went to Lanfang's house many times, but now I don't know the house number of Mei's house on Masnan Road.</p>
<p>Last year, Du Shoumeng and Xiao Dong's "Searching the Orphan and Saving the Orphan," the lines "Madam, you don't have to be too fierce" were certainly good, but every lift of a leg and every gesture had its measure. These places are enough to see their hard work, their true skills. In the past, the old Tan sang "A Scholar's Tale" ("Beating the Nephew and Visiting the Grave"). The brilliance of the whole opera need not be said. Finally, when he came on stage, his few steps were really unprecedented and unparalleled, beautiful to the extreme. From the dynamics of his back, you could see the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness of the characters in the play, as if you saw his heart and liver. Art can reach such a level, it is really admirable.</p>
<p>Famous actors have a kind of skill that is easy for people to know. For example, [omitted character] Wu performs "Three Pulls" ("Selling Horses"), the hat wing on the left side moves, and the one on the right side does not move. The one on the right side moves repeatedly, and the one on the left side does not move. Suddenly, the [omitted character]zi on both sides simultaneously makes a circle. This kind of stunt completely depends on the strength of the head, and it takes several years of hard work to achieve it.</p>
<p>In short, singing opera is difficult, and watching [omitted character] is not easy. Dr. Mei's performance at Tianchan this time, it is not easy to buy tickets, and it is full every day. However, those who can truly appreciate his art probably only account for a very small number.</p>
<h3>Pipe Tobacco</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>I am not much of a pipe smoker, but my ability to resist the urge to buy is very weak. Every time I walk past the glass window of a clean and bright tobacco shop, the shiny pipes of various styles displayed inside always attract my attention. In this way, I have continuously bought four pipes and put them in a corner of my writing desk.</p>
<p>After buying the pipes, I naturally had to buy "tobacco." At first, I bought a kind that was packaged in a tin can lined with waxed paper to prevent moisture, called "Half and Half." I usually smoked it once or twice a week, until recently I finished it.</p>
<p>In addition, my "smoking set" also includes a tobacco pouch, iron wire wrapped in flannel for cleaning the pipe, and slow-burning matches.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, smoking pipe tobacco seems to be more economical than smoking cigarettes. A box of pipe tobacco can last at least half a month to ten days. Moreover, when there are guests, there is no need to use pipe tobacco to treat them, which is equivalent to saving on cigarette expenses. However, the price of goods these days is always rising. The black "Model Pi" tobacco, which was previously entrusted by the Materials Supply Bureau to various stores for retail sale, now costs 100,000 yuan a pack.</p>
<h3>Eccentricities of Literary Figures</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>The English novelist Dickens liked to wear jewels.</p>
<p>The American poet and short story writer Allan Poe liked to sleep with his cat.</p>
<p>The American humorist Mark Twain liked to wear white clothes, even in winter.</p>
<p>The French novelist Daudet liked to sleep with his glasses on.</p>
<h3>President's Ancestral Virtue</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>The President recently went to Dushan, more than forty miles northwest of Yixing County, to pay homage to the tomb of Jiang, Marquis of Hanting Township. This has been reported in the newspapers. Jiang Cheng, the Marquis of Hanting Township, courtesy name Shaoming, his father Heng, assisted Emperor Guangwu in defeating the Chimei and was [omitted character] and died. There were nineteen people, all moved south. The Marquis of Hanting Township and his eighth brother, the Marquis of Yunyang Township, Mo, both lived in the Gehu Lake in Yangxian (now Yixing). The Jiang family of Yixing today are all his descendants. In the Tang Dynasty, the epitaph of Jiang Gong, Marquis of Hanting Township, erected by the descendants of the Jiang family in the fifteenth year of Tianbao, the original stone no longer exists, but the inscription is still in the genealogy, written by Qi Guangyou, the Secretary Shaojian. During the Jin Dynasty, a branch of the descendants of the Marquis of Hanting Township chose to live in Taizhou. During the Five Dynasties, another branch moved from Hezhou to Ningbo, so the Jiang families in Yixing, Taizhou, and Ningbo can all be related. The President cherishes the virtues of his ancestors. Last year, he returned to Fenghua and paid homage to the tomb of Jiang Junming, Grand Master of Gold and Purple Glory of the Song Dynasty. This time, he went to Yixing to pay homage to the tomb of the Marquis of Hanting Township, all of whom are the President's direct ancestors.</p>
<h3>One Dollar Per Word</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Recently, a magazine in Shanghai stipulated that the highest payment for articles would be two dou of white rice per thousand words. For a time, the publishing industry seemed to regard this as a special favor to writers, considering it a grand gesture.</p>
<p>However, according to a recent report in the New York Herald Tribune, in the current United States, payment of one U.S. dollar per word is no longer unusual. It is rumored that the royalties paid to the Duke of Windsor and Churchill for their memoirs published in Life magazine were even higher than this, but the exact amount is unknown.</p>
<p>As early as forty years ago, Rudyard Kipling, the British poet laureate famous for his eulogies of imperialism, had already received a dollar per word. At the time, it was indeed considered an anomaly. An American wrote a letter to Kipling saying: "Having heard that you are selling literature at a dollar a word, I am enclosing a dollar and requesting a sample."</p>
<p>Kipling accepted the dollar and sent him a reply, with only one word: "Thanks."</p>
<p>A few days later, the American customer wrote another letter to Kipling, saying: "Your 'Thanks' word sold for a total of two dollars. After deducting postage and letter paper and envelope expenses, the net profit was ninety cents U.S. dollars. This amount should be divided equally between you and me. I am enclosing your share of forty-five cents (in stamps), please receive it."</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The King of England plans to tour Australia and India, with his daughter Princess Elizabeth as Regent. This short-term regency is roughly like the "acting" position in the old officialdom. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, having reigned for fifty years, is old and tired of her duties. She plans to appoint her daughter Princess Juliana as Regent after holding a celebration ceremony, and herself retreat to a peaceful life, enjoying her remaining years. This kind of regency is a step towards succession, like the Chinese concept of "internal abdication."</p>
<p>In Chinese history, when emperors traveled, it was called "hunting tour" or "inspection tour." A prince or high official was usually appointed as "keeper" of the capital, but they only took care of the gates and such, without needing to act as Regent. The place where the emperor went was called the "whereabouts," and important personnel followed him to conduct business as usual. The Qing Dynasty emperors held absolute power. Kangxi and Qianlong often left the capital and traveled to various provinces. They approved matters and instructed the provinces or the keepers to handle them, so there was no need for a Regent. However, Dorgon of the early Qing Dynasty served as Regent as the uncle of the young emperor, and Zaifeng of the late Qing Dynasty served as Regent as the father of the young emperor, both because the monarch was still a child. Therefore, whether it was a prince acting as Regent or the empress dowager ruling from behind the curtain, they were the emperor's elders. In the West, monarchs must be of age to ascend the throne. When they are old or sick, there is a regency. Therefore, their Regents are usually the monarch's children, first "Regent" and then "enthroned," which is close to the Chinese practice of passing the throne to the crown prince.</p>
<p>The Chinese "internal abdication," the so-called "public court transfer," is an extraordinary event, often containing unspeakable secrets. For example, Emperor Gaozu of Tang passed the throne to Emperor Taizong because of the Xuanwu Gate Incident. The two princes had already drawn swords against each other. If Shimin did not seize the throne and Li Yuan did not yield, it would not work. Emperor Gaozong of Song passed the throne to Emperor Xiaozong to enjoy the blessings of the Supreme Emperor. Although Xiaozong was not his biological son, he was able to be filial. However, Gaozong's licentiousness and incompetence were insignificant. As for Xiaozong passing the throne to Emperor Guangzong, and Guangzong passing it to Emperor Ningzong, it was bizarre and like children's play. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty passed the throne to Emperor Jiaqing because he was already eighty-five years old and could not endure the daily chores. He established a new monarch to work on his behalf, while he still held the power to control the government. Jiaqing held the empty position and received the real Qi, so once Qianlong died, Jiaqing took power and immediately executed He Shen (Qianlong's favorite minister) to vent his long-standing resentment.</p>
<p>In European history, monarchies have gradually been eliminated. The two world wars eliminated several more. The surviving ones, large like England and small like the Netherlands, each have good royal models. The national level is high, the national foundation is stable, and the organization is proper. The monarch has no absolute power in politics and no hidden dangers in the court. Regency or succession proceeds step by step, so there is no problem.</p>
<h3>Poem on Passing Diaoyutai</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>The Seven Li Rapids of the Fuchun River is where Yan Ziling lived in seclusion, setting an example of integrity with his fishing rod. After his death, he was buried in his hometown of Yuyao, at Mount Kexing, known locally as Chenshan, where the Stone Tablet of the Three Elders was discovered in the early Republic. It is less than two villages away from my hometown. During the chaos, I asked for weapons to go south and once passed by his tomb. Later, after the defeat, I fled, wandering between southern Anhui and Zhejiang. I passed Diaoyutai eight times, west of where Xie [omitted character] wept bitterly. The ruined terrace amidst the chaos reflected the green mountains. I vented my anger to the long sky between the [omitted character] and the open space, unaware of the wasted words.</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Green mountains are colorless, water is silent, don't ask how far the road to Jianghu is. Leaning on the lonely awning, I wave painful tears, it's difficult to tell Mr. the past! The grass in the Jimen is green, the soldiers are like mice, the Hu horses' lamps are red, the ghosts fill the city; the characters are empty, the loyalty and righteousness are exhausted, the actors compete for death.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Asked about my family, the calamity is getting deeper, if I can return east and get ten thousand words said! The water and stones at the bow of the boat are still strict, the clothes and hats under the tomb are not Han people. A breath of sword qi remains, the decaying whiskers accumulate like dust on the road, the clouds in the sky are a spiritual mirror, the wind is angry, if the [omitted character] tree does not spring.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The small boat has passed Yan Tan three times, the crazy dream remotely connects to Shunshui, the Han Han is cold [omitted character], the sky is drunk, the swaying remnant candles are like dust; the memorial was originally to seek virtuous officials, the restoration of the soil should eventually judge the villains! Crouching in the bird awning, I make a secret oath, my life is slow, my lungs and liver are true.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>The stream has also flowed away, I can't bear to say that Yi's children are going back and forth here! The fugitive comes today, the whiskers are more and more, only removing horse dung to sacrifice to the green mountains.</p>
<p>A fire burns the [omitted character] in the Cangjiang, the bamboo [omitted character] is broken against the copper lute, the desolate terrace weeps after a thousand years, not for the Liu family or the Zhao family.</p>
<p>Sobbing, the poem is already dry, the wind and sand fill the [omitted character] and the setting sun is slanting, it's pitiful that the fishy smell of June remains, not only the dogs and sheep play at the tomb door.</p>
<p>How can a horse's foot understand this life? The frost beach birds have a return journey, two years without a town or family dream, all entrusted to the fourth cry of the sad ape.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Sleeping three nights, I go east again, coming and going you don't scold, if I can distinguish the local accent, the accumulated hatred is more than the mountains. There is no place to hold a rod to hide, break the reed as a sword to grind! Asking the person with gray hair, how is the ancient pain?</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Although the Jianghu is [omitted character], the guest is uneasy, the lamp marks of the old year are seen again today, a paddle newly adds children's tears, the clothes reflect the water, the summer is cold. (At that time, my nephew was occupied by the bandits, and my wife and children fled to Zeguo.)</p>
<p>Is Tongjiang Chenshan Ferry? Every time I ride the tide, I suspect it's a dream. On the stage, the fisherman laughs, for three years I settled in the bird awning.</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>Swallowing fish by the water, half of my teeth are gone, I dimly remember passing the beach seven times, the tears of Dongtai Huangzhu and Xitai, it's difficult to make up for it now.</p>
<p>The spirit strikes the silk, the tripod still remains, the Hu sand has accumulated on the sea for a long time, Mount Kexing and the land in front of me, the water is blue and the clouds are barren, each in autumn.</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>It's difficult to express a word even if I cut my stomach open, I've come to worship and will rest in death, there is no need to remember the years in the lonely awning, I secretly rejoice if Mr. nods.</p>
<p>The secret oath is clear in the water, the children in front of the terrace understand the deep feeling, the new frost on the return path is gradually white, the clouds make a sheepskin coat to give to the far traveler.</p>
