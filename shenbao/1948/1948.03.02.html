<h3>白崇禧報告剿匪軍事　確保東北安定華北　華中方面匪外援已截斷</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕白委員崇禧一日在中央紀念週概略報吿「最近匪匪軍事」稱：（一）「東北方面」，抗戰勝利後，共匪即欲乘機奪取東北，當時由山東取海道及從山海關，古北口取陸路運往東北，共十一萬六千人。卅五年五月，國軍攻克四平街，長春後，林彪匪部已泄不成軍，當時本可乘勝追擊，直取哈爾濱，滿洲里，佳木斯，將林匪全部殲滅，惜因受政治協商之影響而停戰，致匪得以蔓延滋長，演成今天的局勢。東北是華北的屛蔽，要保華北，必須確保東北，在歷史上，遼金及滿消入關，都以東北爲根據地，日俄戰爭，也即爲爭取東北。來北更有大量國防資源，年產　鐵三百萬噸，煤二千六百萬噸，糧食一千九百萬噸，有三百萬瓩電力，一萬二千公里的鐵道，其在國防上的重要性，已可想見，大本營對於當前東北剿匪軍事，至爲重視，必將以全力確保東北。</p>
<p>（二）「華北方面」目前軍事上，我仍佔優勢，一面確保平津保三角地帶政治·經濟中心，同時由點綫發展，爭取面的控制，以求安定華北，支持東北。</p>
<p>（三）「西北方面」，現在西北軍事力量，實佔絕對優勢，寗靑兩省有相當騎兵，在西北地區爲剿匪最能發揮戰力之兵種，抗戰前，徐匪向前率衆教萬竄擾河西，曾被靑省騎兵嚴重打擊，幾至全部被殲。前次我馬繼援部，以少數騎兵在合水曾消滅匪軍一旅，又前次陜北方面馬鴻逵部騎兵，解楡林之圍，均能表現戰果，目前西北剿匪軍事，只須統一指揮，必能消滅共匪，鞏固西北。</p>
<p>（四）「華中方面」，山東是剿匪主戰塲，自張家口被國軍佔領，匪通外蒙之國際路議已被隔斷，去年我先後克復烟台，龍口，沂蒙山區，膠東根據地已摧毀，匪通國際海上交通又已截斷，不能獲得外援，遂被迫南竄，分途竄擾豫鄂皖三省。劉匪伯承竄入大別山區。陳毅匪部向魯西，皖北，豫東流竄。陳廣匪部，向豫西竄擾，均爲掩護劉匪在大別山建立根據地，戰術上則採用「三求政策」，即求兵，求食，求戰，裹脅壯丁，搜繳民槍，刧奪糧食，避質擊虛，以大擊小，即匪所謂「空中戰術」，然匪雖分途南　，其械彈補給困難，實爲其致命打擊。</p>
<p>（五）「關於大別山區剿匪經過」，自去年八月劉匪伯承率其第一，二，三，六，七，十各縱隊及中原獨立旅，先後渡黄河，經魯西南竄蘇，皖，豫邊境，與李匪先念之第十二縱隊合流，　在大別山區建立軍事根據地·劉匪竄入大別山區後，即掠奪民間物資，裹脅壯丁，搜刧糧食，同時大批派遣村幹，發展地下組織，企圖久据，與陳廣，陳毅兩匪部互相呼應，在軍事上企圖阻斷津浦，隴海及平漢南段交通，切斷畏江杭運，復可待機南渡長江，侵擾江南，東脅首都，西迫武漢，妄想實現其卅六年渡黄河，卅七年渡長江之迷夢。又據情報，得悉匪首曾在經扶開會，決定劉伯承匪部在大別山建立根據地，王宏坤匪部竄擾桐柏山區，李先念匪部竄渡畏江，陳賡匪部　擾伏牛山區，陳毅匪部機動作戰，以資策應。</p>
<p>我最高統帥部爲粉碎劉匪在大別山建立根據地之企圖，命本席組織國防部九江指揮部，其任務即在打破劉匪在大別山建立根據地之企圇，確保南京，武　之安全，維　長江（京漢間），平漢（漢信間），津浦（津蚌間）之水陸交通，九江指揮部作戰指揮之範圍，即淮河以南（蚌埠·正陽·固始·息縣。信陽之綫〕，長江以北，平漢以東，津浦以西，以大別山爲主，包括鄂東·豫南·皖西之一部。</p>
<h3>大別山區剿匪經過</h3>
<p>關於大別山區剿匪戰鬥經過，自上年十一月廿七日以後，我軍逐次集中完畢，開始圍剿，劉匪被迫，主力西渡巴河，向西北逃竄，企圖接收由淮河南下第十縱隊之補充，我各部隊南北壓迫，遂形成包圍劉匪主力於麻城，朱埠以北，光山，　皮河，宣化店以南，形成戰略有利態勢。十二月起，劉匪被迫，乃開始以一部作離心退却，企圖誘我大軍迫擊，而解其主力之圍，其部署以第十，十二兩縱隊向平漢路以西，以兩縱隊向光山東北逃竄，其卞力弟一，三，六縱隊及獨立旅，仍留大別山，當時指揮部遂預先秘密配置大軍於柳林附近地區，匪第十　隊全部及十二縱隊一部共兩萬餘人，於十二月六日經柳林西　，遭我軍三　夜之關殲，計斃匪官兵九三二五員名，　匪官三一六名，士兵三五六二名，鹵復步槍五九二支，輕重機　槍三十六挺，砲十六門，馬一五零匹，其他軍品文件甚夥，劉匪第上　隊主力被我擊毀，第十二縱隊之一部被擊破，大部已喪失戰鬥力，其次確山戰役？上年十二月廿四日，劉匪第一縱隊北竄汝南，　我鄭州指揮部所轄第三師爲策應郾城守軍作戰，於西平附近受挫，匪於倖　之餘，更以第一·三·四·九等雜隊主力共約七萬餘人，於十二月廿八日晚開始　攻確山守軍我第廿師，該師遵命決心固守，指揮部即令強大兵團趙越作戰地境，馳援解圍，並派空軍畫夜助戰，我第廿師官兵英勇奮鬥，經三　夜激戰，待我援軍進至匪方側背正陽明港一帶，形　戰略　勢，匪即潰退，是役斃匪官兵三千四百餘員名，傷匪官兵約計八千人，俘匪官兵三百五十八員名，並鹵獲經重機槍·爾錄槍·步槍等軍品甚多。</p>
<p>以上所列舉係九江指揮部成立後剿匪重要戰　經過，至小規模戰　不累贅述，劉匪伯承，素稱狡獪，曾畢業於蘇聯紅軍大學，爲中共軍事理論家，蘇聯曾誇獎他爲中國戰略家之一，自抗戰勝利後，劉匪一再襲擊國軍，首先我第卅軍·四十軍·新八軍·在新鄕·安陽間受其打擊，以後在魯西，我第五十五·六十六·七十·卅二各師，又先後被其打破，又在鄂東及皖西，我第四十師及五十二師·八十八師各一旅，亦均受挫，劉匪現任「華中人民解放軍司令員」，此次竄擾大別山區，其兵力約計十一萬人，我自開始進剿，三個月來，將能主力擊潰，其傷亡被俘，總數約計三分之一，現已被迫脫離大別山核心，化整爲零，此乃上仰最高統帥德威，及將士用命所爭取戰果，由此民心士氣已大振奮，更可堅定信心，認爲匪並非不可剿，而必可予以剿滅，惟不可過求遠效。過去湘軍與太平軍之戰，經過十五年，淮軍剿平時適經過十八年，即民國十八年至廿二年間，我豫鄂皖三省剿匪，亦歷時約五年。現對大別山這流竄股匪，正分區　淸，刻積極修復公路，架設通信，擇定戰略要點稱築工事，分派兵力固守，一面積極組訓　衆，發揮民力，配合軍隊，肅淸共匪地下組織，如此糧食，壯丁，民槍，均爲我所控制，情報亦可封鎖，使匪無從得糧於民，裹脅壯丁，獲得情報，等於盲月作戰，我則處處主動。只須稍假時日，必可將殘匪肅淸。（未完）</p>

<h3>飛將軍竺培風之死　蔣緯國沉痛追述出事紀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕蔣主席的嫡親外甥竺培風，一月十二日駕駛運輸機飛行途中，在洛陽以西廿里地方，失事　地殉職。蔣主席聽到這消息，非常悲痛；竺君的友好聞訊，也都哀悼不已。國家造就一位人才，原不容易。何况像竺君這樣文武全才，好學不倦的靑年，前途正未可限量，現在竟不幸夭折了。竺君的表弟蔣緯國，今天對本報能者迫述竺君往事時，仍哀痛不已。他一面爲他們之間的友情而傷心，一面又爲國家損失一個人才而痛惜。竺培風與蔣緯國在東吳附中是同學，畢業後，緯國續讀東吳大學，竺則考入中央大學土木工程系。中大畢業，他去英國留學，但後在倫敦大學和劍橋大學專攻建築學，得學士學位，這一段文學校的學歷，已足使一個靑年發展他的抱負了。抗戰軍興，竺適在美國考察，他鑒於國難嚴重，決定棄文就武。在學校的時侯，他的數學成績最好，憑這點根底，他在美國學「天文航行」，畢業後正式飛行，經過初級高級訓練後，學習轟炸科；卅二年學成　國，以空軍少尉官階，在空軍轟炸大隊擔任作戰參謀，先後駐紮在漢中梁山等地，參加多少次戰役。如轟炸武漢，轟炸黄河　橋等役，竺培風都駕着他的鐵鳥，把　彈向敵人的建築工事上投擲，予侵略者以打擊。卅三年，他曾奉派到美國，入參謀大學空軍參謀班受訓。抗戰勝利後，轟炸大隊人員大多改派到空運第二大隊工作，他於是由轟炸改爲運輸，仍任作戰參謀，不過這時官階已升到上尉了。</p>
<p>軍人原是以身許國的，空眾因爲職務關係，更爲危險，當他們決定成爲空中勇士時，生死早即　之度外，竺培風參加空軍作戰數年，出生入死，幾番逃出險境，都不侖挫折他的銳氣，這一次却不能不說是意外，一月初，他奉命自徐州運輸汽油到西安，平安到達。一月十二日，他們由　安原機飛返徐州，機中一共六個人，此外，別無乘客或貨物。突然，他們發覺飛機發生殺重的故障，按逍理說，他們可以放棄飛機，自己跳傘，可是竺培風却爲了養國家節省一架飛機，於是而設法迫降。這時是在洛陽以西的上空，當他們徐徐降落距地面僅有二三百呎的時候，飛機突然着火爆炸，被中六個人，竺培風，副駕駛員，兩位機械士，兩位通信士，都一齊毀渡了。</p>
<p>不死於對日抗戰，或戡亂剿匪的空中戰塲上，却死於日常運輸飛行時，對一位戰士說，多少有一點抱恨；但更抱恨的，却是戰士的老父，媽婆，和幼女。培風的父親是竺芝珊先生，現任中最行上海分行副理，母親是蔣主席的胞妹，却早亡故了，他是獨子，無兄弟姊妹，從小就受蔣主席的撫育。主席對他特別喜愛，爲了救國家於危難，他不　從專安全的工作，却頭捨身於沙塲，直到卅四年十二月廿五日，他才與楊郁文小姐結婚於重慶。楊小姐是黔主席楊森第三位女公子，婚後夫妻盛情非常好，曾生了一個女兒，現在還不滿週歲。培風失事後，老人家和未亡人都痛不欲生。現在遺柩由楊小姐送回奉化縣竺的原籍，全家仍　居上海，在這家庭中缺少一位中心人物，其凄凉景況是可以想見的了。</p>
<p>蔣緯國爲記者敘述竺培風的性格時，特別指出竺平時　歡靜坐深思，對於一切問題，都有深遠的見解；動起來的時候，却熱烈的動。他的籃球綱球都打得很好，在劍橋大學時，他的網球還是校隊還手哩！竺生平對特朋友極誠懇，對職務極中買，從來沒有一句怨言。　國說：「培風表兄的殉職，對我是一個很大的刺激，同時也是一種很大的鼓勵。我們弟兄都分別在軍隊中工作，他是參軍，我在陸軍，現在他不幸殉職了！我想祗有我加倍的努力，才能扺補他殉職的損失！」</p>

<h3>正視工廠原料問題！</h3>
<p>修正進出口貿易暫行辦法所列第二類貨品，大部分屬工葉原料，自去年二月十八日公佈首次限額以來，至本年二月二十日爲止，先後辦過五次（五六兩季係合併一次公佈），其數字如下：</p>
<p>第一季　九九，六七五，〇〇〇美元</p>
<p>第二季　七二，六一〇，〇〇〇美元</p>
<p>第三季　六七，八七三，〇〇〇美元</p>
<p>第四季　五三，三九三，〇〇〇美元</p>
<p>第五六季　七三，四七六，〇〇〇美元</p>
<p>以上五六兩季之平均數字，爲三六，七三八，〇〇〇美元，可見限額數字，逐季漸少，到最近兩季，比第一季，巳不足百分之三七。雖於首次宣佈時，據當局宣稱，第二類貨品之限額，大都係按戰前三年平均輸入價値而定，對於國內生產之情况，及國貨代用之可能性，亦已加以考慮。但以限額逐季縮小，而國外物價，與時俱增，又以共匪擾亂區城日益擴大，致國貨代用品如棉花，羊毛，小麥等，其來源大受阻礙，故一般工業原料自必大感缺乏。當第二次限額公佈時，輸管會即已坦白承認，明知限額數字，與生產事業之需要比較，仍將感覺不敷，而現在許可的輸入限額，比那時又减少了一半，其捉襟見肘左支右細的窘况，更不難想見。因此火柴，毛紡，橡膠各業會紛紛請求放寬限額，紡織業以存棉有限，其情况尤爲可慮。至一般廠商，以粥少僧多，對於分配問題，曾發生工業公會與進口公會間之爭執，老會員與新會員間之爭執，甲區域與乙丙等區域間之爭執。而一年以來，减工解雇糾紛，層出不窮，亦皆以原料不繼爲主要原因之一。一方面則以物稀爲貴，囤積居奇，致黑市日益猖獗，各工廠於配得原料後，以製造利潤不及轉售原料之　且易，每每私售漁利，爭營黑市，無形中反减少了生產的興趣。今日虛設行號之外，蓋已別有一種虛設之工廠，專以爭奪配貨，轉手圖利爲事。其從事生產的正當廠商，則以所配原料不數應用，迫得求之黑市，求之私貨，以勉强維持其生產。因此，黑市敢熾，而走私之風亦愈盛。</p>
<p>上面這些現象，如果單是紛擾與混亂而止，亦或可以稍忍須臾，以待局勞之好轉。誡如職管會所說，唯　貿易局勢逐漸改善，各方需要得以合理調整。無奈原料確乎不　，生產便要中斷，這却不單是工業問題，而是整個的經濟問題，亦不單是經濟問題，而要牽動到整個的社會問題與治安問題了。據官方統計，自勝利後即卅四年八月起至去年年底止，本市勞資科紛案件統計爲三，八七七件，而其中屬於雇用或解雇性質的，即達一，六五二件，約佔百分之四三弱；又去年（卅六年）一年中是項紏紛案件超過了過去十六個月的總和。可證商廠解雇的事件，正在與時俱增中，失業情形的確是日趨於嚴重了。</p>
<p>這問題究應如何解決呢？最理想的辦法，當然是開放外匯，令外洋原料，自由進口，便可以源源接濟了。但這是事實上所不可能，亦是當前貿易政策上所不許可的。其次，即是疎導土產，從產區運到工業區，以補充部分的用途，這是大家所當共同努力的，但亦要看國內軍事，交通等形勢如何。所以目前所可致力的，我們認爲只有從努力吸收僑匯與推廣出口入手，這是爭取外匯資金的唯一辦法，亦是換取原料維持生產的唯一辦法。而其緊要關鍵，仍在於進出口連鎖制度能否實行，與自備外匯貨物，能否准予進口。這兩件事，如果准許做到，則上項問題，就不難順利解決。</p>
<p>現在國人的海外存款究有幾何，雖復言人人殊，但徽用借用等辦法，旣迭經官方宣佈，外交上具有困難，則除因勢利導，任其以辦貨投資等方式，自由流入國內而外，殊無其他招徠的辦法。而在現行外匯管理辦法之外，要求僑匯悉數內流，不再傍溢到他處去，則除因勢利導，任其以辦貨投資等方式，自由流入國內而外，亦別無其他招徠的辦法。我們實在不明白，政府究採什麼方針，一面細於頭寸，聲言歡迎外資，而一面却深閉固拒，不許國人自有的外匯還歸國內？他們袞袞諸公，究不知持何理由？如果說，外來物資漫無限制，形同傾銷，將危及民族工業，則輸出入管理辦法具在，當不難在品類上嚴加限制。如果爲夾帶走私，難以防堵，則走私之風，於今爲烈，國家並沒有因此而一律杜絕正當的進出口。我們揣想：他們所持的最大理由，無過於防止外匯黑市，以免刺激物價這一點。其實，外匯黑市，在戰時，在戰後，從來也沒有　絕過，而物價的刺激，其因素亦甚多，決不會因此而穩定得下來。相反地，必需的外貨湧入，物資校充，倒或可以暫收物價和緩之功效；此則可以回溯宋院長時代物價相當穩定，而獲得旁證。</p>
<p>上項理由，同樣地可適用於進出口聯鎖制度。因爲這項制度之所以延未實行，據說，亦是由於上面這幾種顧慮。否則進出口准許交換，不　以貨易貨，與政府現在的貿易政策並無衝突；而且出口貿易上的不利，由進口商自行負担，正可藉此而推動出口，外洋原料源源而來，用不着消耗外匯，在政府亦屬得計。假如進口過量，或遺反禁令，自可依法限制。這些辦法，正所謂一舉數得，政府又何樂不爲？</p>
<p>或謂土貨中進口商搜羅出口後，政府將無外匯可得，不容不予以鄭重考慮。不知進出口聯鎖後，收購土貨，並未許進口商以專利，商人旣可購運出口，政府亦何嘗不可分逍並進？而且除了是項資金以外，政府自別有其外匯來源，如賒貸·易貨。及各式借款等。在出口貨方面，雖分去了一筆頭寸，而在進口貨方面，亦同樣省去了一重負擔。其結果，却是出口增加，外資（連僑匯及海外存款在內）流入，生產發展，捐稅增收，實際上并無所失。</p>
<p>總之，原料是否接濟得上，這斷不是少數廠商的利益問題，而實是國家的命脈所繫。所以進出口應否准予聯鎖，自備外匯應否准予進口，以及出口貨如何推廣，僑匯如何吸收，這都是技術問題，我們雖無成見，不過要維持國民經濟，就不能不維持民族工業，要維持民族工業，又不能不維持充分的原料，這却是很明顯的道理。像目前那種原斜恐慌，皇皇不安的狀態，以及資金逃避，工廠南遷的空氣，凡是關　國計民生的人，尤其負責的當局，實在不容再予以漠視的。而且照五六兩次的限額表，一定數量的汽車，依舊許可進口，但並不給予外匯，這已明明留下了一條自備外匯得以辦貨進口的途徑。這條途徑，何以只許適用於汽車進口，而獨不許各工廠援照辦理？難道因爲汽車商大多是洋商，故特爲他們開一方便之門麼？這尤其是難以索解的一件事！</p>

<h3>范登堡出席参院辯護　援歐數額不容消減　援華援希土案即將付番查　美衆院外委會要求領導世界抵禦赤化</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約一日廣播：華盛頓訊，參院主席范登堡今日力促參院通過歐洲復興計劃，認爲此項努力足以在第三次世界大戰發生之前，先行加以阻止，而成爲未來百年歷史之轉捩點。此項立法，旨在爲自由世界之自由人民，謀取和平與穩定。渠主張通過援歐計劃第一年之費用爲五十三億美元，不應加以削减，因削减之後，其成功之可能性將見减少。凡事務求澈底，不應躊躇不決。蘇聯之阻撓，使援歐計劃之前途不無障礙，但美國必須竭盡所能，將世界自危險中解救出來。范氏並稱，美國對拉丁美洲，中國及希土等國，亦負有援助之責任，必須在本屆議會中加以商討云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕美國消息靈通方面稱：美國於本月底即可批准馬歇爾援歐方案。參衆兩院在四個星期內必可最後通過該案，然方案若於三月卅一日通過，物資之自美開始運歐當在數月以後。同時此間權咸方面預料三月初英國經濟政策之撿討，將因馬歇爾方案之即將實現而變更其基礎。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日合衆電〕美衆院外交委員會頃要求美國領導保衛「非共產黨世界」，俾其免於蘇歐共產黨之書，否則美國將面臨全世界之「暴力革命」。該委會發表之長篇報吿，題名「共產主義之世界戰略與戰術。」該報吿認爲蘇聯政策之結論如下：（一）共產黨有一種目的，即世界革命；（二）彼等認爲此項革命將爲暴力革命；（三）彼等不承認今後和平可以維持，彼等期待另一次大戰。該報吿稱，共產黨奪加「極端民主集團」時，則彼等以卑鄙手段，利用此種集團以達其目的，並滲進工人團體。該委會主席爲俄亥俄州共和黨鮑爾敦，此項報吿係於「共和黨宣言」一百週年日發表者。該報吿認爲預防全球赤化，應盡力建立經濟鞏固之集團，以美國爲領導者，包括西歐·中國·近東及西半球。</p>
<h3>法總理請人民提高警覺　堅守歐最後堡壘　金融措施未能收效危機潛伏</h3>

<p>我們不可過於悲觀，亦不可妄自揣測。我們應注意國界以外的發展，但亦不可僅以蘇聯判斷歐洲事務。吾人在法國應恢復國家之福利，吾人如能建立社會和平及公理，將爲對於共產主義最有效的反對。人民共和黨全國委員會並通過決議案，譴責普拉格之政變，斥之爲反對民主而設立少數人的獨裁。全國委員會另又通過一次議案，擁護許曼之奮力復興法國經濟，遏制物價之上漲。</p>

<h3>十年內將有戰爭　美民意測驗</h3>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄（三七）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>嚴峻不一定是妥善的手段</p>
<p>一九四四年九月，當總統決定與邱吉爾首相會晤，舉行第二次魁貝克會議時，他問我，是否我願隨他同往參加。那時我正身體欠佳，而鄧巴頓橡樹會議又正在進行中，所以我回答他說，我想留在華盛頓，但他如需要我時，我當即可抽身前去。</p>
<p>在會議將舉行前不久，總統正被迫須讓財長摩根韜隨同前往參加。摩根韜和他的友人們多時來曾在草擬一個處置戰後德國的苛刻的計劃，而　於德國暴行的那些團體的領袖們要求總統，逖摩根韜同去魁貝克，提出他對處置德國的計劃。</p>
<p>總統自已有這種見解，覺得德國人民整體應該給予他們一個永矢勿忘的敎訓。一九四四年八月廿六日，他曾有一個很長的備忘錄給陸長史汀生，送給了我一個副本，其中反對陸軍部爲指導佔領德國的軍政府官員們所編的那本手册的內容</p>
<p>他說：「這本書予人一種印象，就是，我們要把德國，和荷蘭，比利時一樣地完全恢復，把德國人民儘可能迅速地回復到他們戰前的狀况。</p>
<p>「道一點是最最重要的，就是每一個德國人必須認識，這次德國是戰敗了。我並不是要他們餓死，但是，舉個例說，如果他們需要更多的食物，以保持身體與靈魂的合一，那末，我們應由睦軍的廚房中來燒湯，一天餵他們三次。這可以使他們身體完全健康，而他們將終生記得這個經騐。無論從整體或個人來說，他們已是個戰敗了的國家這個事實，必須使他們如此淸楚認識，使他們將來不敢再發動一次新的戰爭」。</p>
<p>關於處置德國海軍的問題，總統提出了一個新的意思。</p>
<p>十月十三日，他寫給了我一個備忘錄，其中說，他贊同聯合參謀本部關於澈底毀滅德國海軍的意見，但他有一點補充</p>
<p>他說：「過去的所謂毀滅，意思就是把艦隻拖到海中去沉掉。我想，有時候投降的艦隻是被弄成廢金屬，作爲毀滅。我不贊同把數千萬噸鋼鐵沉入大海，作爲澈底毀滅的這個辦法。</p>
<p>「最近，已發現這些艦隻可有個新的用途。我們曾把沉沒的船來作防波堤，以築新海港，在義大利和在諾曼第海岸，我們都曾如此做過。這是一個築造防波堤的比較價廉的方法。我想，聯合國機構應可通過　國的要求，把這些艦隻用於確定的目標，把它們沉於海灘作爲防波堤，以改善或新築停泊設備。把它們用於這種和平的目標，是一個很好的意思。</p>
<p>「在這種情形時，艦隻應儘速沉於指定的地點，並由聯合國機構的小組委員會在塲監視。艦隻一沉下，將永不可能再把它們撈起來，重新用於戰爭的目標」。</p>
<p>一九四四年九月一日，雷普金來對我說，總統希望組織一個「內閣對德問題小組會」。</p>
<p>「內閣小組會」於九月五日在我的辦公室舉行第一次會議，霍普金，摩根韜及史汀生亦出席。我提出了一個我與僚屬所事先準備好的備忘錄，日期是九月四日，其中包括內閣小組會可能送呈總統的一些預擬的建議。</p>
<p>史汀生部長幾乎完全同意這個備忘錄，祗除出一點，就是德國人民的生活水準應降低至生存綫上爲度。摩根韜部長也似乎也同意備忘錄中的大部份，但不願確切聲言。霍普金在九月五日給了我一個短信，其中說，除一些並不致影響備忘錄內容的文字上的小小保留以外，他也贊同。</p>
<p>第二天，我們這幾個人在白宮和總統會晤。我把九月四日的備忘錄送呈總統，並且說，小組會其他各委員尙未完全同意，但它可以作爲討論的基礎。史汀生提出了一個陸軍部的備忘錄，與我們的大體極似。但摩根韜，却提出了財政部苛刻的原來的備忘錄。</p>
<p>討論無結果而散。國務院，陸軍部方面與財政部方面的意見是如此大相逕庭，其後即未再作討論。</p>
<p>魁貝克會議於九月十一日舉行之時，我們的情形就是如此。我們在意見方面未能獲得任何協調。我上文說過的，糜根鞱誘迫總統讓他去參與會議，會中他準備向總統與首相提出自己這個極端的計劃。我呌駐加拿大大使安塞頓（Ray　Atherton）代表我們去奪加。</p>
<p>會議開始後四日，我接到總統九月十五日發給我的一個備忘錄，使我大爲震驚。這備忘錄顯示，他與邱吉爾已在大體上接受了摩根韜的意見。備忘錄中說，總統與首相感覺，防止德國重整軍備的最好辦法，其要點之一，就是對於魯爾及蕯爾區之將來處置。德國冶金，化學及電器工業日平時轉至戰時之迅速容易，曾予我們以極深的痛苦敎訓。同時，我們亦應記得，德國曾破壞了蘇聯及其他盟邦的很大部份的工業設備，所以這是很公平的，那些受損害的國家應有權利把它們所需要的機器搬走，以補償已受的損失。</p>
<p>備忘錄中續謂：</p>
<p>「所以，上　爾及薩爾區的各種工業必須停閉。吾人感覺，該兩區應於世界組織下交託一國管理，由世界組織監督這些工業的拆除工作，確使此等工業不致於某種掩飾詭避下重整旗鼓。」</p>
<p>「這個去除魯爾及蕯爾區戰爭製造工業的辦法，目標是在想把德國轉化成一個在性質上主要是農業和畜牧的國家。」</p>
<p>「首相和總統於此辦法已表同意。」</p>
<p>總統在備忘錄中附給我的信中說，他對此頗表滿意。他相信，我也必能同意不使魯爾及薩爾區復興這個大體的意思。</p>
<p>可是，我却覺得不能同意任何計劃，其「目標是在想把德國轉化成一個在性質上主要的是農業和畜牧的國家。」七百萬的德國人不可能儘靠那一點德國的土地生存的。他們要因此餓死，要因此成爲別的國家的重負。這個方策將引起德國人永無休止的仇恨。這將是爲了一部份人的犯罪而微罰了全體人民及其子子孫孫。這將不單是懲罰了德國，而且懲罰了大部分的歐洲。</p>
<p>總統在信中又證：他想，他已羿好了佔領德國軍隊所駐的地點。他曾希望以德國西北部作爲美軍佔領區，但復來和邱吉爾同意改由英軍佔領，美國則佔領南部大部份地區，包括巴伐利亞在內。</p>
<p>九月十五日，即總統送一給我包括摩根韜計劃與決定佔領區的備忘錄的同一天，他又給了我另一備忘錄，其中吿我，摩根韜在魁貝克，和他的處置德國計劃一起，又提出了一個對英借款六十五億美元的計劃。這看起來似乎像是個交換條件，財政部長用這來使邱吉爾附和他那個對待洪水猛獸似的處置德國的辦法。</p>
<p>總統在備忘錄中說，他已同意，在德國戰敗而對日戰爭仍在進行之時，英國可繼續從我國獲得價値三十五億美元的軍火援助，和三十億美元的非軍火援助。他同意邱吉爾　聲明，就是如果聯合王國要淸理戰債，那麼它現已减縮至極小數量的出口貿易，必須重予建立。當然，自租借法案及其他類似借款中所獲得的物資，不得輸出或出售牟利，但有一點是必要的，就是美國不應於租借法案供給英國的物資下，附帶任何條件，因爲否則將使它的出口貿易無法恢復。</p>
<p>這使我似受攔腰打擊。這將使我們與英國三年來所進行着的談判毀之一旦。這破壞了一九四二年我們和英國簽訂的租借協定第七條，該條規定英國戰後應採取不分軒輊的商業政策，意思就是說，它將取消帝國關稅優先權。</p>
<p>我相信，這在魁貝克的整個發展，使我憤激之甚，與我就任國務卿的整個時期中任何一事可以相比。假如這個摩根韜計劃洩漏了出來，而洩漏又是無可避免的—後來果然洩漏了—結果將使德國拼命地作困獸之鬥，使美國多喪失數千數萬的生命。</p>

<h3>全面配糧價格決定　每人一斗廿四萬元　吳市長等聯合招待記者報告　所得米款用作社會救濟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市計口憑證定量配售食米制度，業自昨日起正式實施，每人每月配米一斗，配　價格定爲每斗二十四萬元。配米證業於昨日發出。爲使市民充分明瞭起見，吳市長民食調配會任主委，行政院美援華物資處理委會代表潘光迴，及美援華物資委員會吉爾派屈克，潘恩等，特於昨日下午五時，在市府聯合招待本市中外新聞記者。首由吳市長閘明配米目的在於穩定米價。過去以食米來源恐慌，致未能實行，此番承美國援助，特致感謝之忱。嗣由任主委報吿辦理配售之詳細情形略稱：此次辦理全而配售，以求簡單爲原則。凡屬市民，不論老幼，每人每月配米一斗。爲顧慮購米時擁擠起見，配米證分爲兩種：一種上半月用，一種下半月用。米店並不指定，市民持證可選擇區內任何米店購米。此次本市所有米店米行均參加工作，動員者計米店二千餘家，米行二百餘家，經紀人一百三十人，掮客三百餘人。均給與利潤百分之五。今後市民往購時，可比較米樣，且可囑其送到，不取送力。本市配米證昨起已分發至各區公所，囑其於三天內轉發各住戶。市民即可憑證購米。</p>
<h3>決定配價因素　市長報告</h3>
<p>至於配米價格之決定，據吳市長報吿二　：（一）以自由市塲之實際價格九五折計算之。（二）於每個月最後五天中，決定下個月之米價。本月　　價係根據昨日自由市塲之　　。昨日市價上好白米爲二百八十萬，加百分之六利潤，應爲二九六萬八千元，因美救濟食米每担爲一五〇斤，而本國米每担爲一六五斤，故打九六折，合二八四萬一千九百元。因配米質料較次，故再打九折，合二五五萬七千餘元，再打九五折後，爲二四〇萬二千五百元。爲便於計算，決定配米之價格爲每石二四〇萬元，每斗爲二十四萬元。</p>
<h3>美方代表三點　見</h3>
<p>美援華物資委員會吉爾派屈克表示：上海爲世界第三大都市，國際人士均極注目，希望配米制度得以試辦成功。站在觀察者立塲上發表三點意見：（一）此次配售計劃以四個月爲一單位，此四月內之食米供應，須充分儲備，即使下期食米亦應早作準備，此點本人業向國民政府提出，並已蒙接受。（二）配售計劃之實行，全國五大都市一視同仁，上海現由單獨機構——民食調配委會負資，且由市府合作，深信必能成功。（三）美國方面，認爲在目前中國整個經濟情况中，此乃無辦法中之好辦法，希望能遍行全國。　繼由行政院美援華物資處理委會潘光迴說明美救濟食米所以售賣之原因，由於根據中美協定之規定，須將該項食米，售於五市，以其所得充作救濟之用，分別捐於社會救濟及醫藥衛生兩方面。故救濟乃鵠的，而配米實爲工具。</p>
<p>社會局長吳開先，昨未出席，惟曾發表書面談話，內容爲；（一）希望全市市民和政府切實合作。（二）希望經辦人員努力奉公。（三）希望全市行政機關各級主管協助。（四）希望與論界支持。</p>
<h3>只許成功　不許失敗</h3>
<p>最後由吳市長發表二點結論稱：（一）感謝美國供給大量物資（全面配售之食米，一半爲政府供給，一半爲美國供給），使配米得以實行。（二）聲明配米之行政責任，完全在乎市府，與美援華委會無關。爲此，配米只許成功，不許失敗·否則市府勢將大坍其台。在配售制實行伊始，特呼　負責之公務員，各米店，及全市市民一體合作。</p>

<h3>參議大會重要決議　取消用電超限罰款　以最近三個月用電最多之月為限度　未超過四十度者仍以四十度為標準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日下午繼續舉行第五次會議，除繼續四次會議未竟議程，即對民政。警政。及社會等局提出質詢，並由三局長相繼答覆外，另討論關於節約用電重要提案一件，經大會討論結果，決議取消用電超限罰款辦法，請市民自動節約，試行半年。其詳細決議計有五點：（一）自本年三月一日起請市民自動節約，並請公用局迅予今飭各電力公司自三月一日起所抄表碼之帳單，暫行停止罰款。（二）以上年十二月份。本年一月份及二月份中用電最多之月爲用電限度，但十二月。一月及二月份任何一月未超過四十度者，仍應以四十度爲限度。（三）凡超出用電限度，其第一次警吿，第一次嚴甫警吿，第三次超過限度百分之三十以上者，予以一星期以下之停電處分。（四）上述辦法試行至本年九月底再行檢討成績，如有問題，再行商討改進。（五）以上各點送請市府汛　執行。</p>
<p>要求　發還　電機</p>
<p>此外附帶決議：上海華商電氣公司，在淪陷期間被敵拆裝於北平石景山，現爲資源委員會華北鋼鐵公司所接收之發電機，由本會專案電請行政院轉飭該會及有關機關迅予發展，以資解救南市電荒。</p>
<p>維持　節電　原則</p>
<p>按上項決議案，乃根據公用組審査委員會詳細商討後之審査意見修正而定。此次大會有關節約用電提案共計七件，經歸併後提出案由爲：「爲减輕市民負擔，試行取消用電超限罰款，並請市民顧及電力來源困難，力自撙節用度」。故潘議長亦再三表示，罰款辦法雖決議取消，但節約用電原則，仍應維持，希望市民務必自動開電，一方面亦可試驗市民是否有自動節制之能力。</p>
<h3>金都案優恤死傷　黃牛黨竭力取缔</h3>
<p>局長叔平答覆質詢：（一）答陳培德之建議稱二警察取去車夫墊子，已數次命令禁止，茲擬計劃由巡守亭警員管理，並設流動警察所，管理違章情事。（二）答張志韓問：浦東匪首因在南匯地區犯罪，故押解該縣，所稱越獄情形，已呈報　備部。武裝人員無故千涉市民，已再三會同　備部取締，但未能澈底。靈小學案，已由法院處理。金都慘案市民二死一傷，已請市府優恤。（三）趙君豪報吿二（１）平凉將新康麵粉廠於去年十月，被債權團代表，率同檢林路警察分局司法股員孫仲軒等，　佔廠房並遭毆打，由　季方律師代表登報向本會呼　，社會紛　　其事，警局人員如此濫使職權，當局何以不加査辦，而該廠登報三日，又何以不加申明。（２）本市黃牛黨愈形猖獗，並有走國際路綫者，在碼顛帶領美國人至不正當處所，如不加取締，此種「國民外交」何堪設想？俞局長答稱：平凉路新康麵粉廠事，已送法院，司法股員違法，査明後決予嚴辦。黃牛黨亦在竭力取締中，然因事實困難，未能一網打盡。（四）答張中原問：舊貨商因收購贓物之故，打手印所以調査過去是否犯罪，非無理由。新進妓女執照，一月份起已停止發給。（五）答陳存仁問：乞丐佔住小菜塲，決設法取締。（六）答失文德問：郊區警備車缺乏，因經費無着，希望參議員能發動捐助。（七）對陶百川所述海寗路一警員誣吿十三歲小學生竊綫，被打成疾一事，則謂本人並未知悉，務必調査嚴辦。（八）答姜豪問：公開賭博必予禁止。關於　員化裝嫖客，在揚十·滄洲飯店，調査私娼，但都宿至次晨，始電警局派人逮捕一節，諒不致如此　　　，當再　　明究辦。</p>
<p>市參議會今日下午將繼續舉行第六次會議，討論提案。</p>
<h3>吳局長答覆　對禁舞質詢　未做錯一事　對得起舞女</h3>
<p>社會局吳局長開先昨在大會中答覆質詢，對禁舞問題更作詳盡說明，並表示渠「思維再四，並未做錯一事，可以說對得起市民，對得起舞女」。關於張中原，張志韓問是否可請中央暫緩禁舞及市府何以不尊重大會決議案，則稱：本人可負責答覆者，即如中央批下來暫級執行，則本局決照辦，或在三月底前中央不作任何表示，則亦暫緩執行。至於對大會決議案，本人非但有公事呈請中央，並親自晋京向中央陳述，甚至舌敝唇焦，中央仍不准，非執行不可，故此乃中央不接受大會決議，本人惑到抱憾。至於本人係政府官員，自未便代表奪議員向中央講話，希望參議員自推代表去說，則亦可知本人所得經騐。</p>
<p>中央催促　不能再延安</p>
<p>對於范錫品責問抽籤時間何以不照規定？抽籤方式殊不合理，舞業開會之前何不禁止？代表請願何以不見？舞業代表旣說在新仙林，何以又在社會局提到？及對成立特別法庭諸點，吳局長答稱：（一）抽籤時間改在上午，因是日（即一月三十一日）下午適舉行勞資評斷委員會議，而在二十九日，已奉中央來電，詢問辦理抽籤情形，故決不能再行延期，祗得在上午舉行。（二）抽籤毋須有法定人數，曾請參議會及市商會准派代表，但都回稱未便參加。</p>
<p>暗渡陳倉不及預防</p>
<p>（三）舞業開會前，兪局長特派飛行堡壘前去禁止，然舞業人員以偸製方式，暗渡陳倉，對警察表示解散後，再跑向社局，後宣司令在社局還向代表申斥，三時開會，警備部於二時才接獲通知。（四）舞業代表究竟有否至社局請願，可請當時在塲之議長。副議長證明。（五）舞業代表在新仙林開會，本人並不知悉，乃是范錫品君自己吿訴本人的。（六）特別法庭應否組織，與吳開先毫不相關，主席命令乃給吳市長，並非給本人</p>
<h3>凍結生活指數　試驗並未生效</h3>
<p>此外，（一）對張志韓所提生活指數影嚮太大，可否組織特種審査會硏究後建議中央，定一適當辦法解決之。吳局長謂，目前生活指數，已有運用及審核兩委員會，如再要組織委員會，本人亦可接受。生活指數凍結辦法，在去年已經試驗過，然並未生效，因物價仍不能凍結，而物價之不能凍結，其原因則在通貨膨脹。本人意見，希望大會決議，請中央趕快開放工貸，或以收購製成品方法，使工廠勉强維持，工人不致失業，否則半年以內，上海必出大事情。</p>
<h3>案插難民從事生產</h3>
<p>（二）　　　貴所詢工人配米漲至八萬元一斗，吳氏答稱：係中央命令，但一月份生活指數之米價，即已按照八萬一元編製。（三）對梅漸濃，施關所詢難民問題，則稱本人當盡力向社會部要求幾個行總工爲，使難民從事生產。</p>
<h3>選票未逾發出票數　不能認為即有弊</h3>
<p>關於民政局之質詢，經張局長曉崧一一答覆如下：（一）瞿鉞所提各區調解委員會問題，張局長表示，調解會無法律上之權力故許多糾紛無法澈底解決·（二）姚抱眞，李樹滋所詢之自衛隊何以尙不成立一點，啓在短時期內即可辦理。（三）賈德超質問吳市長關於選舉舞弊。答稱：市長因公未出席，在本人範國內，可答復者如：本人係選舉事務所總幹事責任在執行職務。票數較選舉參議員時爲多之原因，因當時戶口爲三百四十　萬人，而現在則有四百四十餘萬人。且開出數若不超過發出票數，則不算舞弊。各區投票所，寥落者固有，擁擠者亦有。至於多出票數之區，事誠有之。即以眞如區論，計選民二三，六七六人，發出票數一六，五〇〇票，區一長所報投票者僅爲五，〇三三張，但開出票數，則有一一，一一四張，票雖多出，但按之發出票數，並未超過，故又不能認爲舞弊·至該區開票結果，以　　票最多，共佔七，三六七票，則爲事實。總之，此次選舉，有無舞弊情形，監察委員正在澈査中，査明後自有適當處置辦法‘（四）對於宗　　　質　之兵役慰勞金帳目，則謂是項　勞　係由各區辦理，貼補安家費用者，現有十四區，已經呈報，其他各區，則仍在催報中。至於舞弊淸形，確實有之，保團部人員已送法　　者五起逃亡者二起（五）對邵永生建議尊重區民代表會職權，加强保田組織，訓練區保人員等，自當予以接受，設法改善。惟因保民集會及訓練地點一時無着，以致無法迅速辦理。（六）對趙仰雄所問區長是否可兼參議員，則稱經內政部解釋，不得兼任，當再行査淸後通知大會。</p>

<h3>賠償機械　招待參觀　大部日本自製衣　間有德國出品　包裝週密品質良好</h3>
<p>〔</p>
<p>本報訊〕經濟部上海工商輔導處接收之日本賠償民營物資，迄今共爲機器三百四十三箱，其中有車床，鑽床，銑床，牛頭鉋等十餘種，均儲藏於浦東招商局第七碼頭倉庫·該處爲使各界人士明瞭接收機器之內容起見，特自昨日起，連續招待各界代表奪觀三日。昨日午後三時，工廠人員及新聞記者，首批參加，乘招商局國光輪赴倉庫參觀。</p>

<p>折合法弊　計算評價</p>
<p>經部顧司長昨與記者談及民營賠償物資之處理，謂評價委員會業已組成，惟尙未舉行會議，將來第一步將先決定若干評價大原則·盟總開出之價目，以美元爲單位，將來我國接收後之評價，自有本身標準，雖以美元作單位，但支付時則按國行掛牌折合法幣計算。因機器開箱之後，保管不易，將來價配與廠家時，不再開箱，如廠家於啓封後發現機器有問題，評價會對此亦將規定統一處理辦法。</p>
<p>電力償價　成為問題</p>
<p>據昨日同往參觀工廠代表之意見，認爲此類機機器，平均約二噸一件，每件機器之時値，約爲五億元左右。機器固屬可用，但所成爲問題者：一爲電力，即工廠擴充之後，本市電力是否足供應用？二爲償價問題，即目前雖經規定分四期付款，但期滿時是否能予付淸，如不能淸償，機器是否由政府收回？因此渠等對價購一　，認爲亦有「相當風險」·</p>

<h3>開獎方式</h3>
<p>開獎時市民前往體育館作壁上觀者達數千人，體育館大門口縣旗結綵，運動塲中搭起臨時關獎台，水銀燈光照翻通明。搖獎工具向中央儲蓄會借來，爲三架地球儀形之鋼質搖獎球，可以上下旋轉。台上正中爲甲球，直經約有二英尺，左右爲乙球丙球，直徑均約一英尺。號碼球約如彈丸大小。乙種房屋獎券六十萬張共分五十組，每組（即每一字）各一萬二千張，自〇〇〇〇〇起至一一九九九止，共一萬二千號。搖獎方法係由三個搖獎球分別搖出後併成。第一球爲丙球，內裝刻有「巨」『闕」『珠」『稱」……等字之小球五十個，即爲獎券之組別。第二球爲乙球，內裝刻有〇〇至一一等號碼之小球十二個，即爲獎券號碼之前列兩字。第三球爲甲球，內裝刻有〇〇〇至九九九等號碼之小球一千個，即爲獎券號碼之後列三字。三搖獎球每次搖出之結果合併後，即爲某組中獎號碼。自丙球搖出之字，第二次搖時不再歸入球內，甲乙兩球搖出之號碼則仍歸入球內續搖第二次。如此先後搖五十次，遂得五十組中獎號碼</p>
<p>各界代表　陸續莅臨</p>
<p>搖獎典禮於二時廿五分開始，二時左右，看台上已人頭擠擠，冬令救濟會職員在總幹事王先靑領導之下，忙碌佈置。監察人江蘇監察使嚴莊，社會局局長吳開先，處長袁文彰，市商會徐寄廎，地方法院陳寒冰，地檢處全甸，記者公會馮有眞，總工會王正誼，市黨部方治代表陳以德及其他各界代表，均陸續蒞臨，二時一刻吳市長趕到，儀式旋即開始。首由市長致詞稱，乙種房屋以三月份物價估計，成本約八億，市値則在十六億以上。最近有人懷疑義買券開獎方式並不公開，今日在此開獎當可擊破此種無稽謠　。</p>
<p>未售出者　近十萬張</p>
<p>繼由王先靑報吿乙種券六十萬張共售出五十萬零四千一百六十九張，餘數未售出者由市銀行保管。甲種券迄今售出尙不足半數，故延期至四月十六日開獎。王氏繼解釋搖獎方法後，即開始搖獎，時爲二時三刻。首先將字球及號碼球放入甲乙丙三大球內，均由嚴壯監察使檢査無誤，在放置〇〇〇號至一九九號之號碼球時不愼，將數粒散落於地，乃車新全部檢點以示愼重。搖時每次搖三轉，然後開啓閘門，三大球內即各有一粒小球滾出沿承　滾入預置之玻璃缸。工作人員將號碼一面在麥克風前報吿，一面用黑板掛出，並塡寫於牆上之紅牌上，同時由勝利電台轉播開獎進行情形，以供市民收聽。最先開出者爲「始」字組，最後開出者爲「巨」字組，至三時三十公全部開畢。</p>
<h3>五日　起持　券掉　證書</h3>
<p>至中獎號碼之得主姓名，昨尙無法査明，凡　現自已業已中獎之倖運人物，可於三月五日起持劵到市商會向冬令救濟會房屋義　組掉換證書，待房屋建築完成後即可遷入矣。</p>
<p>吳市長於開　前曾報吿接到南洋中學附屬小學學生朱承烈朱承永兩人來函構，各以壓歲錢一百萬元買乙種義賣券十張，如能中獎，願將房屋標賈後捐作助學金，又另一無名氏亦來函稱，已購買乙種券十張，如中獎，亦願捐作冬令救濟，惜結果比三十張　劵　　均未中獎。</p>

<h3>年產五百萬株　最大宗輸出物資　建木　種砍運銷</h3>
<p>〔本報福州二月廿七日航訊〕在福建省，無論任何一個季節裏，佔輸出物產最大一宗的便算木材，「建木」這一名詞，無論在華南華北甚至南洋菲律賓，都將是頂熟悉的，它產自閻省很多個角落，　江流域的建甌建陽便是個頂著名產區，他如沙縣水吉·松溪·政和·順昌·崇安·古田·尤溪·南平·永安·長汀·龍巖·大田·永定等縣，都是林木薈萃地區，依戰前的統計，單閩江部分年產約三百九十萬株，汀江部分也有九十萬株，九龍江十七萬株，其他部分亦約二十萬株，總數是五百萬株，以今天的幣値來乘這個數字，那種數目是値得欽羨的。</p>
<p>「建木」的種類甚多，主要有杉·松·樟·桐·枬·花梨。烏柏·楠木·按·白楊·黃楊等數十種，但以外銷情况言，則杉松二者頂多，今天沿着閩江滾滾而下，曁運經馬尾裝上輪船一批批向南向北載去的幾乎全是它，此類木材悉產自深山曠叢中，若要追溯其祖脈流傳嫁賈經過諸般情况，則別具一番風味。</p>
<p>種　辛勤撫植　除舊佈新</p>
<p>在年年巨量的砍伐，不斷的輸出形况下，福建木材決非是由其自發野生茁長的，它需要極有計劃極其耐心的辛勤撫植，而且是要每年每年以「除舊佈新」工作才行，在閩北各縣，一百萬以上的木農們，以往大抵是每年秋季盡便計劃來年增植事宜了，起先利用秋冬之交那種風高氣燥季候，放火燒山，隨就利用焚餘的草灰炭末作爲肥料，等到來春種。發芽時節，便抽殖大批樹苗種下。這樣在起初十年內，每年至少要至每一株樹下除草一次，十年過後，樹大成蔭了，則改而再行燒山，再以其焚餘殘燼，利用其作爲二批下苗肥料，大凡一根木材的成長需經過廿年，也就說每株樹橫斷面有廿圈「年輪」後，這些樹才可以成材。（通常正材是指直徑六寸長以上木材，）到這時便可以隨意砍伐，砍後根除淸楚，然後再如法換上新苗。通常山頂風猛水分少，不易長大，樹苗多在山側種植，較易發達。</p>
<p>砍　　斧之前　探其傾向</p>
<p>砍伐木材是一項相當困難艱鉅的工程，在深山叢莽中，單用些斧頭和人工，欲將生根數十年身重數萬斤的樹身翻到，這中間不必耗費多大力氣，好在中國從古下來都遺傳有一副經驗結晶，砍伐工人則亦懂得利用科學原理，下斧之初，先探知其「傾向」，然後在其傾側開弊，俟入木七八分後，用　將其拉倒，之後，砍去枝葉，去掉表皮，再按其長短大小截爲各式木材.其中全條長者謂之「長梢」。一丈六至一丈四者謂之「正材」，一丈廿者謂之「桶木」，一丈者謂之「橫丹」，八尺者謂之「一比」，八尺下則廢爲雜材。</p>
<p>砍伐工人帶專門性質，全係他地倔傭而來，現工資每日可七八萬，唯極端危險，時常有被樹壓死可能，砍工工頭中曾施行一種極最　格的「單行法」，規定每一工人壓死只由工頭賠五千塊錢，這一「規矩」迄今未　，一條人命不及現今油條一根，可嘆之至</p>
<p>運　全　溪水　五項手續</p>
<p>因材木伐全在山間，而運　工其幾全賴溪水，故第一步工作即將木材搬至溪旁，關於這，要經過五重手練：（一）「開路」，（二）「排竹」，即放置竹排一供行走，工作目標。（三）放溪：將木材運至溪邊。（四）蓋印，蓋上「行號」或「帮的」字號鐵印，以資辨認。（五）裝排，這下構造極複雜，亦係硏究木材運銷者所不可不知的事情，即所謂「裝排」方式分爲三層，最小單位爲根，繼爲「篤」，三爲「運」，每篤按木材大小，有的五根（謂之五底）七根（謂之七底），計分五，七，九，十一，十三，十五，十七，十八，廿一，廿三，廿四，廿七，卅，等十三種，超出「卅底」外則謂之「綑根」。然後「篤」併成「連」，通常「運」亦分六篤，七篤，八篤，十二篤，十四篤等多種，然後加上竹釘繩練，一俟春洪汜濫，便可沿江流運下。（通常自砍至運需時至四五個月至一年）而且照舊制，木材下運工人要換三班，第一班上游各地撑至南平，第二班由南平撑至水口，第三班水口放至福州。各不相侵，否則立刻涉訟。據統計在全盛期間，每月自閩江下運木材數達二千五百連至三千運之多。</p>
<p>銷　國內國外　無遠弗屆</p>
<p>「建木」銷買情形可分省內·外二者，一則自產地購運至福州，一則自福州轉運至外埠（大扺爲靑島，天津，營口，廣州，香港，菲律賓，荷印，上海等）。福州目前經營此道的可分爲二大派系，一爲「公司派」，計有華僑，國林　公司，興業公司，集美公司，華通公司，閩省農林公司曁江浙帮大批商人等等，再係「木客」帮，此派力薄然帮大，彼等多負責自產地運榕售買工作，因資本薄，受剝削甚慘。福州有變相木行甚多，專施放高利貸，對象即爲此批木客，受貸者除屆時需將木材售予該行外，並依舊得計算利息，淸償行佣，且尙限定餘款需十日後補還，在此種制度下，木農遭遇頂爲悲哀，會有一則故事（其實是最近發生的）閩北某縣一家三代業木農，祖父種樹，父親砍樹兒子運樹，來榕售買，結果運費，還債扣除下所得，僅堪置棉被　一條，帶回禦寒，福建木農生活慘况，可見一斑。　而一般公司因產地頻頻報漲，　運費浩大，亦多裹足不前，兼近頃華北時局吿緊，北方銷路殆乎斷絕，更造成林業界廣大恐慌，據華僑中國林業公司副經理陳佩植吿記者稱，半年前各大公司已率吿虧折，現自榕運至上海木材水脚除外贏利部分不及什一，唯一辦法便是囤存倉地，待價而沽，目前福州，南平，上海，三地囤有本材數目已漸可觀，何日可得淸售，尙難預……</p>
<p>一般意見，「建木」前途堪慮，因木農無利可賺，過去二年內，增植渚始已絕跡，苟年復如此，則十年廿年後，「建木」來源勢將全部斷絕。但政府刻又不能禁止其自由砍伐，否則百萬木農生活將全陷絕境，今後如何扶植木農，打通銷路，廣植木源，改善運銷辦法，這當爲閩省農林當局主要課題吧。（本報記者黃埀慶）</p>

<p>〔本報杭州一日訊〕浙江的交通，原來是很便利的永路可以舟代步，陸路有滬杭甬，浙贛兩條鐵道貫通東北西二面，公路之發達與優良，尤著於國內；祇有浙南山地間，交通較爲困難。抗戰八年，浙江的交通破壞得非常厲害，鐵路公路幾乎破壞盡凈；經過兩年餘來的復員，因經費困難，祇修復了浙贛綫路和三分之二弱的公路，記者對浙贛鐵路進工的報導巳多，而浙省當局在「交通剿匪」的大目標下，公路交通，益見重要，恢復興築，亦頗有成績，所以也來報導給關心國家建設的讀者。浙省公路的</p>
<p>創辦時期</p>
<p>在民國五年至十六年間，省府以　烟稅收入，築成蕭紹，嵊新，黃澤，三段，共長八十七公里同時，獎掖商人投資建築杭餘，餘臨，餘武，杭富，及瓶湖桑等路綫，共長一百八十八公里，那時每公里的建築費平均祇有六千元。民國十六年後，由於政局的安定，乃從事整個的計劃，擬定全省路網，由省，商同時積極進行，其中工程較大的有浙閩，浙皖，浙贛等綫，至二十三年，已築成二·九〇六公里即從前認爲工程艱鉅難通公路的絡　，　靑，龍浦，江浦，奉新，新天臨等綫，也先後完成了。廿四，五年間又究成杭　，嘉湖，麗松等綫，凡四百七十公里。廿六年上半年度復完成開　路，嘉興區交通路，永瑞平路等三百餘公里，運前共達三·七一七公里，全省公路網至此已大致完成了。那時，就面積論，每二十方公里便有公路一公里；以縣境說，除地多　嶺或孤立海中的　順，景寗，仙居，玉環定海諸縣外，其餘各縣都可互相通達了。可是日本侵略者的火熖摧毀了這許多血汗的結晶！浙江地接滬海，杭嘉首先淪陷，寗波沿海的公路，爲了戰略關係，都自動破壞；及三十一年五月，敵侵衙州麗水，公路受創最深，那時僅存龍浦路一條，計九十三公里了。後來局勢好轉，遂漸修復，迄勝利前夕，尙有龍泉慶元，江山浦成，江山常山，當山淳安，草萍常山，華埠　江,楓嶺，一渡關游頭八都八綫，共長七六八·一〇公里。勝利以後由交通管理處</p>
<p>緊急搶修</p>
<p>至三十六年三月，該　改為什么公路局，繼續進仃，到三十六年八月，巳修復的路綫計有麗港路（麗水纏南山至大港頭）江游全路，（江山經衙縣龍游，蘭谿至金華）嵊東永路，（　縣經東陽耗永康，）碧游路，（南山經碧湖松　　至龍游，）　細永路，（麗　經　　至永康，）杭　路，（杭州經紹興，曹娥至　縣，（杭　路，（杭州經餘杭，臨安，於　，昌化至溫嶺關，）京杭路，（杭州經武康，吳興，長興，至文十　，（鄞奉路，（　縣至奉化溪口，）　　白路，（蘭谿經壽昌至白沙，）留轉至綫，（留下至（　塘）錢江大橋　綫，杭塘路，（　司至塘　段，）拱三段，（拱宸橋至三廊廟，）滬杭路，（杭州經海寗，海　，至金絲娘橋），莫千山支綫，浦鐘路，（鄭家塢至浦江），義東路，（義烏至東陽），杭淳路，（杭州經桐　，建德，至淳安），　　綫嵊新段，（嵊縣經新昌，天台，臨海，黃岩，至澤國），乍平嘉路，（乍浦經平湖至嘉興），嘉湖路（嘉興經王江涇，平望至吳興），曹觀路，（曹娥至觀海衛），觀鄞路，（觀海衛至寗波），奉新路，（溪口至新昌），奉海路，（奉化至寗海），宣武路，（宣平至武義），餘武路，（餘杭至彭公黃湖），鎭駱路，（鎭至駱駝橋），蕬駱路，（蕬谿至駱駝橋），路椒支綫，長廣路，（長興經泗安，至廣權），方岩支綫，塲　支綫，天臨黃澤路，（天台經臨海，黃岩，至澤國），新天路，（新昌至天台），等卅六綫，共修復二，二五二公里。其中巳通車而因公款短少，工程簡陃，尙得改善的，計達五八六公里·至卅六年底，又修復三三八公里。正在籌劃進行或已局部興工的路綫，則有一〇〇八公里，預計今年可以通車。在</p>
<p>交通剿匪</p>
<p>的大目標下，浙省為　軍事上的需要。今年決定完成十二條大幹錢：長（興）廣（德）綫，華（埠）整（源）綫，龍（泉）慶（元）綫，安（吉）泗（水）綫，餘（杭）百（官）綫，籣（谿）浦（江）綫，臨（海）仙（居）綫，於（潛）千（秋關）綫，雲（和）景（寗）綫，桐（　）分（水）綫，餘（杭）武（康）綫，和三門綫，共長五四六公路。爲了便利四明山綏靖區的淸剿工作，並將以四明山的蜻蜓崗爲中心，自餘姚，上虞，嵊縣，慈谿，奉化，新昌，諸縣城，各築公路，通到蜻蜓崗。爲了便利淸剿浙閩邊境的匪衆，將和福建省府合作，興建慶元（浙）至政和（閩）的公路，公路局計劃興　，且經測勘的新路，則有通皖要道餘安，　泗路，三門　綫，紹蘭路，餘百路，　環　綫五道。</p>
<p>浙江公路</p>
<p>建設，在量的方面遠不及　　三分之二，在質的方面也未如原來的平坦堅固，但是翻開地岡來，省道大部已〕貫通各縣，如餘姚等縣，縣這也幾乎　通各鎭了。至於鄰省間，通汀蘇的巳有京杭，滬杭兩條國道，通安　的巳有杭　國道和淳安火埠間的省道，通到江西的，已有華　埠　　（源），常（山）玉（山），江（山）廣（豐），以及　（嶺）廣（豐）四綫。通到福建的則有浙　國道，龍（泉）浦（城）省道二綫。加上計劃中的路綫，眞可說是四通八達了。但是路面的簡陋，和行駛車輛的不足，這需要大大改進。今年是浙江的</p>
<p>建設年</p>
<p>我們希望這「建設年」三字，不　是一句口號，不祇爲工作人員打打氣，而要眞正把省政的重心放到建設上去，替浙江人民挽回因戰爭而喪失的元氣。記者深望今後的浙江公路建設，不僅要在量的方面拓展新的領域，即在質的方面也要顧到水準，迅速完成永久性的建設。（本報記者黃行天）</p>
<h3>西安燈市</h3>
<p>〔本報西安二月廿七日航〕假如說長安之冬宛　一幅墨水畫，黑的是人，枯　，烏鴉，白的是冰，箱，雪，灰的是天空，那末，過了舊歷新年而至元宵，到處抹上新的顏色，其艷麗處又似一幅三色版挿圖或五彩電影片。看那燈市處處，萬紅千綠，鏤銀箔金，我們就想起舊小說如「紅樓夢」中描寫的長安花燈，其美麗和熱鬧，並非誇張。　夜了，月正圓，看一　紅燈送走了冬之魔，而迎接春之神，又像一根魚絲釣起了多少人美麗的童年之憶念。還有啊，正如紙剪花，年費，門神木刻，……一類造型美術品，元宵的花燈亦可從農民鄉土藝術和民俗藝術這些角度來研究。它反映出西北農村一個側面像。</p>
<p>長安雖是歷代帝都，但花燈無論　形體，題材，岡案諸方面，並不保留有多少宮廷氣。這一點就反面的證明了花燈是生長於農民的鄉土。</p>
<p>在來自南海之濱的筆者　年回憶中，我們的故鄕有種類最多大小不同的魚燈，此外就是蚌·蝦·蟹……這一些海產做題材的花燈。長安地　西北高原，遠離海岸，無怪乎燈市上，找來找去，祗有一種金魚燈。那是模做養在　璃缸裏的魚吧了。</p>
<p>相反的，這裏有許多種獸類五畜的燈兒，在我們鄕間却沒有的。長安燈市，有許多馬燈，（不是走馬燈），偶爾還有些駱駝，驢子，猴子，和不知名的野鳥牲畜。長安人在新年　對白色並不完全禁忌，白馬燈，白兎燈很暢銷。白馬燈在廣東人眼中是不祥之物。　這裏，夏天極不易見鮮蓮花，但蓮花燈做出的模樣兒却比江南沿海一帶做的講究得多。每一瓣蓮花小心地用金水描出花瓣的脈絡，瓣尖兒還包上金色的尖·這格調顯然是遵守佛像裏畫的蓮花。　反映代表西方文明之侵入如汽車，火車，輪船，飛機之類的花燈，比江南沿海一帶的也少得多。我至今還沒有看到半個輸船燈。去年，有一位小學敎師依　報上的形式紥了一些飛機燈，什麽「噴火式」，「閃電式」，「黑寡婦」式，結果，失敗得今年不敢「再來一個」了。今年流行着一種帶有「幻想風」的飛機燈，形式很有趣：機翼變成兩面三角大旗了，旗邊還貼上鋸齒形的流蘇，螺旋槳改爲風車，機後的昇降舵槳改爲鳥類的後羽。我深信這是一個創造，一個反映的造型，而帶有高速度能凌空的機械美在素樸的農民心眼中就「作如是觀」。這像白日夢，也像達里的「超現實主義」。</p>
<p>此間還有些花燈是利用鳥羽畜毛直接貼在燈紙上，筆者不曉得別的地方有無類似的「寫實」方法，一併誌此，以備留心農民鄉土藝術者參考。</p>

<h3>出動高蹺　宣傅禁政</h3>
<p>〔本報西安二月廿六日訊〕禁政在陝西向來是一件吃力不討好的事，但從去年春延安光復陝北局面澄淸後，省府在一年間鏠除了三·一〇三畝種罌粟田圃，這最澈底的辦法已有數字證明其效果。依最新的統計數字，去年一年間本省內緝獲毒品五千八百多市兩，處理與毒案三千件，較於前年一年間緝獲一萬八千多市兩，六千多一件毒案，顯然已經减少了一半至三分二。</p>
<p>當然，目前　開完全禁絕的階段尙遠，比如本市之警吿烟民戒烟期限之再三展延，可知這事情難以「一蹴而幾」。這幾天鬧元宵，到處有「社虎」「高曉」出動，而用「舊瓶新酒」的方法，用「高曉」宣傳禁政，已給予市民右深刻的印象。</p>
<p>「王祥門」是西安槍斃烟犯的刑塲，所以有些「高蹺」還寫着醒目標語：「玉祥門外，及早回頭。』（本報記者麥葉）</p>
<p>（上）利用「高蹺」宣傅禁政（下）化裝表演　「槍斃烟犯」，以加強禁除之宣傅。</p>

<h3>爲教育叫屈（續上月日八日完）</h3>
<p>— 莫仲義</p>
<p>第二：「敎育不是有錢人的裝飾品，專利品，每個人受敎育的機會均等，這是民主國家的起碼條件。」這話是不錯的，然而這不祗是敎育本身所能負的責任·以我國的國民經濟情形看來，即使自小學至大學一律免費，並給予公費，要每個人受敎良的機會均等，還是做不到的，在月前，我國的國民敎育或强迫敎育，失學民衆補習敎育，都是不收費的，甚且供給書籍文具，但辦理上列敎育的人，深深體驗到招生與留生的困難。鄕村與城市的兒童與靑年，他們要在田間工作，要在工廠做工，要在家庭中操作，他們實在沒有時間入學。他們爲了家庭生活，你不要他的學費，硬要他入學，但於他們的實際生計無補，他們實在是有心無力。即在大學與中學，在抗戰期間，實行貸金與公費制度，數年以來，雖對貧苦靑年有甚大的帮助，然而欲維持此種制度，希冀大學與中學敎育機會均等，在目前的中國，在國民經濟未改善以前的中國，實在不易辦到。從我國的單軌敎育制度君來，敎育並不是爲有錢人而設，從我國的敎育宗旨與敎育方針看，敎育並無作爲有錢人的裝飾品與專利品的氣味。但事實上，中國目前的敎育，確有爲有錢人的裝飾品與專利品的事實。那不能責備敎育，而應責備中國的經濟制度之不合理。若以此來加諾敎育本身，未免寃枉，不能不爲敎育呌屈。　「至於師範生的待遇，更不能與普通學生的公費看成一樣作用」，而是已由敎育部解決了的。</p>
<p>畢業生無出路豈宜專責教育</p>
<p>第三：「敎育妨礙社會生活的發展」，這一點，張先生以自己　體驗，指出受了中學敎育，並不比小學畢業更能賺錢，大學畢業並不比中學畢業令家庭滿意。因而說中國的新知識份子的出路，不外兩條，一是做官，不得官做就敎書，感到人生的窮途末路。因此以爲任何一個人都可以在一定的環境下發展他的才能，創造一番事業，而張先生受了大學敎育，却失去了創造的精神與能力，於是認爲這是傳統敎育——書本的敎育，文學的敎育所賜予，認爲敎育和生活脫節。養成不勞動習慣，以致妨礙社會生活的發展。這種議論，本早已有人提及，提倡生產敎育，職業敎育與社會敎育的人，即常以此種理論作爲根據，然而這種理諭却是因果倒置而不合事實的。依我看來，現代的敎育不但沒右妨礙社會生活的發展，反而是社會生活的不發展妨礙了現代的敎育，使敎育蒙受了不白之寃。敎育的目的並不是敎人賺錢，也不能滿足封建思想，反之，欲藉敎育以求業求利，那才是敎育的失敗。中國的新知識份子沒有出路，不是敎育之過而是社會之過。中國社會百業不振，受了敎育的人沒有出路，難道沒有受敎育的人就有出路不成？有了專門學識，沒有用武之地，這種人才過剩的現象，如果說是敎育之過，那敎育只有不辦，才是直截了當的辦法。敎育與社會的需求不能相應，社會實應負其最大的責任。若一面期待敎育培養人才，一面又責敎育培養的人才沒有銷路，不但從事敎育的人束手無策，即是神仙也難爲力。在目前的中國社會環境，如能　張先生所說「任何一個人都可以在一定的環境下發展他的才能，創造一番事業」，那才是奇蹟呢！如張先生一樣「受了大學敎育却失去了創造的精神與能力」的人，他不是吃了敎育的虧，相反的，他却是吃了社會的虧。有不少的大學畢業生升官發財，也有不少的中學生和小學生甚且一字不識的人飛黃騰達，難道這是敎育之過嗎？社會的怪現象不責諸社會而怪敎育本身，寃哉，枉也？</p>
<p>教育者不能使受教育有勞動的習慣，可以責備，但若以爲學生欠勞動習慣，即妨礙了社會發展，也非正當之論。中國的勞動者爲數不少，估計全國農民占全國人口百分之八十，與受敎育的人相比，後者眞是鳳毛談角。請問：中國在未實施新敎育以前社會生活，又有過什麽發展？敎育應培養各種人才，應具有各種設備與環境。普通敎育不宜與日常生活脫節那是應該的，但專才敎育即與日常生活脫節亦無妨礙。一個科學家或一個文學家，他專心於他的發明或他的創作，他的習慣與日常生活即使脫節，也無足怪。至於罵傳統的敎育是書本教育和文字敎育，也未免偏激了些，請問張先生，你能創造一種不用書本不甩文字的新鮮敎育制度嗎？　生產敎育，職業敎育，與社會敎育提倡已十餘年。其所以未能見有顯著的進展，其原因是：在敎育本身去變花樣，變來變去，正如孫行者逃不去如來佛的掌心，社會的生產落後，職業不振，和國民生計困窘，使敎育事業不易開展，才眞正是敎育的致命傷。我們再不能倒果爲因，責備敎育了。</p>
<p>注重文字訓練未必扼殺個性</p>
<p>至於第四張先生以爲傳統的敎育注重書本和文字的訓練，即扼殺了靑年的個性，養成一批書呆學　，也不盡然。敎育無法拋棄書本與文字，上文已說過。至於因此而扼殺了靑年個性，養成書呆子與學蠹，也未免太過武斷。各級學校各地學校，甚至每一個學校都免不了有書呆子與學蠹，也免不了有終日逃學與書本無緣的學生。照我看來，目前中國的學生如張先生似的書呆子與學　，不覺其多，反覺太少了些。如果說敎育已把中國靑年的個性扼殺了，爲什麼有「五四」運動，以及其後的學生遝動，這這理我百思不得其解。　最後張先生埋怨在大學有公費可吃，家裏的人餓飯，也歸咎到教育身上來。難道敎育可以解決受敎育者以外的人的吃飯問題嗎？那敎育眞是萬靈靑藥，無上法寳了。大學畢業感到一片黑階，覺得前途悲哀，那是政治與社會的不合理而非敎育之過，在別的國家裏，大學畢業生爲什麽有出路，而獨我國的大學生悲哀？這理由是顯然的。以中國五千人中僅有一個大學生而言，在政治安定，經濟勃興，各業發展的時候，無論如何是不够用的。徵諸抗戰期間大學畢業生爲各界預定搶用，即爲明證。</p>
<p>至於顧先生所指出的敎育的弊害，關於考試制度一點，已在上文加以答辯。說各級學校都是爲了升學準備亦非事實，固然，各級學校都免不了升學準備，但你能禁止學生的升學志願嗎？若言學生畢業，除升學外，難有出路，那麼眞的定了一個敎育制度出來，如雙軌制度之類，禁止一部分學生升學的志願，即可解決問題嗎？說「敎育依賴上一級，根本沒有它自身獨立的人格，」未免不據事實，信口雌黃。初等敎育是實施國民敎育，中等敎育是實施師範敎育，職業敎育，與準備升學的中學敎育，高等敎育是實施專門人才的敎育，怎能說「根本」沒有自身獨立的人格？顧先生的結論說：「我們現在的學校敎育，除供有錢人升學之用外，其他簡直一無用處」。不知顧先生受過「我們現在的學校敎育」沒有？你是不是「有錢人」？你是不是「應考留學」？如果有一「不是」，那「一無用處」之說就不能成立了。即使你自已受過現在的學校敎育，你又有錢，而且已經留學，學成歸國了。倘若有許多人，曾經受過現在的學校敎育，而他們沒有錢，又沒有升學，却還生活在中國，生活在人間，那現在的學校敎育，該還是有點用處吧。　中國的敎育，常爲有識之士所罵，不懂敎育的人，隨他去罵好了。如果是敎育圈內的人，也想罵：敎育來洩氣，我以爲還是先行考慮一下的好，免得局外人說你自己太不爭氣。</p>

<h3>杭市籃球義賽晨友大勝之江今日對空校當晚返滬</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州一日電〕晨友籃球隊來杭奪加本市冬賑義賽，今日下午三時首次與之江交鋒，天氣晴朗，觀衆千人，由儲裕生高尙志任裁判，之江力弱，聯絡不周，致遭慘敗，上半時十二比四〇，下半時十四比卅五，晨友共勝四十九分。明日下午晨友與空校戰，勢均力敵必有精彩表演。</p>
<p>〔國光社杭州一日電〕杭冬令賑災籃球義賽，行將結束，上海靑年會籃球勁旅晨友隊，昨日抵杭，今日下午三時在浙江大學球場，與之江大學籃球隊交鋒，球迷數百人，頗見熱烈，晨友隊領隊李雅谷，亦於賽前由滬專程趕到，結果晨友以七五比廿六大勝之江。</p>
<p>雨後出戰，球塲濘滑，栽判儲裕生，晨友首取攻勢，且得老將盧谷邃助陣，聲勢益盛。王蓉生王炳福等運續破籃，護分頗多，之江雖全力反攻，奈林子良獨木難支，上半時完畢，之江以十二比四十一洛後。休息過後晨友仍舊步步爲營，之江易將頻頻，以車輪戰應付，收效甚微，結果晨友以七五比廿六大勝之江。</p>
<p>當晚六時，冬賑會，假晨友隊下榻之淸泰第二旅館大廳，設筵招待客軍，席間賓主聯歡，頗爲融洽。晨友隊今日下午三時仍在浙江大學與空校隊比賽，當晚晨友隊搭六時三刻班夜快車返滬，而杭垣冬賑籃球義賽，亦將功德圓滿，幕落結束。</p>

<h3>社局停止在市場拋食米恢復自由買賣　人心虛阮白粳昨下降二十萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨起恢復自由買賣，當局停止在市塲拋米｛因政府開始實施全而配米，及產地價降等原因，人心虛軟，多存觀望，市價下降二十萬元。昨南市登記到貨一三〇〇石，北市一三五〇石五斗。市價特高粳二九〇萬，白粳二八〇萬，薄稻南市二八五萬，北市二八三萬。早稻南市二七五萬，北市二七二萬。羊秈南市二八五萬，北市二八〇萬，碾秈南市二六五萬，北市二六八萬。白元南市二九〇萬，北市二八〇萬。陰元南市二八〇萬北市二七五萬。</p>
<p>麵粉跌停</p>
<p>錫市暴落，食米跌勢又兇，晨開各牌粉均跌至停板限度，仍乏人進辦。塲外兵船粉低至一百二十三萬，紅蜂建成各爲一百二十萬元，暴落八九萬元。麩皮晟開即跌至七十五萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧傾瀉</p>
<p>在米市跌風下，黃豆最先遭殃，漢口乍豆去化仍呆，跌達一成半以上。本豆跌勢較緩，平湖特粗跌五萬元，浦東杜豆亦回二十萬元。芝蔴天津帮不動，本街去化又呆，九江奶蔴回小二十餘萬。棟靑低三十餘萬，苞米高貨跌勢較緩，啓東苞米跌十五萬。中關貨猛瀉二十萬至二十五萬元。菉豆回低，生仁乏人問津，紅糧無做開。</p>
<p>食油下降</p>
<p>產地雖不報小，而滬市銀根趨緊，米市又跌，貨主迫於銀根，脫貨求現者多。吉桶生油開六百五十萬元，猛落六十萬元。本廠豆油廠方開售爲五百七十萬元，回籠單子五百六十萬元，較前一市軋低五十餘萬。生菜油生蔴油吉桶小車油各小五十萬至六十萬，豆餅實銷轉懈。</p>
<p>洋米續到</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國總統輸船公司代理阿梅而蘭拉古斯號；由美運來洋米六萬一千七百餘包，預計本星期內可到滬。又招商局海宇輪，昨晨出口赴仰光，專往裝米九千噸來滬，自本市裝該輸運港，有中紡紗布一千二百件，聞赴高雄裝糖三千噸運新加坡。</p>
<h3>華股疲後回堅臨收大多轉昂</h3>
<p>華股昨疲後回堅，銀根焦應，亦由緊張而轉鬆弛，銀行帮一六八號二三二號對美亞及地產股，作投資性之搜羅，亦吿見秀，總勢似層小康。</p>
<p>晨初業中人心不安，銀根亦緊，以致報載美暫緩討論援華之訊，亦無影響，均見開低。永紗以九九〇元及一〇三〇元之價登塲，開後曾由一八八號等補進，升爲一〇〇三元及一〇三五元高價，八九號等了結即交，一六號等脫售遞交，迫降至九六五元及九九三元，一七三號等吸收遞交，七八號等亦分別購納現遞，永紗回升爲九八三元及一〇一三元·塲外息價未更，査禁不絕，銀根轉緊，圈外刺激俱减，二一九號等紛紛了結即交，一四一號等再出遞交，除聯地成交有限，獨吿漲停，餘股紛紛回頭，景綸且吿跌停。七六號等趁低維持遞交，三六號進即交，午收永紗升爲九五八元及九八九元。結果蛟上週六計即交股景綸跌停後有回，軋跌成半，麗安中絲景福國貨商務跌一成左右，永紗美亞信和華豐新光甲法新華火柴永公內衣榮豐大通跌半成，聯華漲停，餘均微挫。遞交股勤興跌一成，餘均降半成。</p>
<p>後市漸形和緩，一三〇號雖出，永紗自九六五元及九八八元起，二三六號等進即交，七八號等進遞交，升爲一〇〇〇元及一〇二〇元，九八號等出即交，二二號等出遞交，退至九八八元及一〇〇二元。一四六號等進遞交，七一號等進即交，國行差進有限，美亞突然轉俏，永業聯華兩地產股，掛高至漲停限度，臨收反動見殷，永紗漲到一〇二五元及一〇三六元高價，而後以一〇二五元及一〇三五元收市。較晟收計永業聯華漲停，國貨閘北景福勤興景綸麗安中絲漲一成左右，，永紗美亞信和華轉新華中法商務榮豐統益升半成，中紡微挫，餘咸回好少許。遞交股均漲半成左右，塲外各未上市股票，以文化股市華最爲俏利。以有增資決定也。餘股榮辱不一。</p>
<h3>統債回小外股下游</h3>
<p>公債昨被環境所迫小，多方復遭銀根所扼，統丙自九萬七退至八萬五低價，而後稍平。五五二室買進，五〇三室先出後進，大成興及五五五室五五〇室均售，成交約二百萬。較上週六計甲乙跌一萬元，統丙降一萬五，了挫一萬二，戊種亦低一萬四。</p>
<p>外股昨港電平穩，業外刺激大减，除航業有助買訊而獨秀外，均吿下游。橡皮股軋小更多，洋行帮及證券帮賣出，散戶稍納。怡紗晨開即退爲一一〇萬，低價一〇七萬，而後回升至一一〇萬外收市。較上週六計怡紗跌半成，怡啤平平，航業小升，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>二期庫劵暢銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三十六年短期庫券，連日銷售轉旺，第二期自開始發售，截至二月二十八日止，全國共售出三百二十四萬六千八百美元，折合法幣二千一百五十四億七千四百四十五萬四千元。內上海市售出二百十三萬零五百五十美元，折合法幣一千四百二十二億四千零十六萬五千元。</p>
<p>茲悉：三月份仍以售餘數額繼續發售。又第二期券票，在本年一月底前售出者，各經售行局，均已憑預約券換領完竣，二月份售出者，亦將開始掉換。</p>
<h3>食糖續軟</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平疲，大部轉軟。一公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白三百六十五萬元，小五萬元。四半白初小後緊，爲三百七十萬元至八十五萬元，無甚上落。二〇中砂白爲三百十五萬元至二十一萬元，台赤三百十五六萬元，小四五萬元。</p>
<p>棧單交易，八期初跌後回，結果僅小二萬元。九期甚軟，前後小去二十餘萬元。土糖汕提靑二百四十萬元，小十萬元，汕赤二百六十五萬元，興化白高貨二百五十八萬元，興赤略小爲二百四十二萬元。刁靑二百三十萬元，小十萬元。海赤二百四十萬元至三十五萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市原檔盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，因出口商活動不力，過程依然冷靜。至於內銷茶，買戶仍以本街及蘇錫等地之去化絡繹，胃納遂猶濃厚，故交易尙稱蟬聯。惟其趨勢則均在原檔盤旋，與上週不分軒輕。良以賣方雖擬拉提，但續乏刺激消息，可以振奮人心，於是欲好仍難。然據一般目光，在各貨存底空虛中，似俱無看小之象。</p>
<h3>申請價購賠償機器截止日期將予展延</h3>
<p>據經濟部工業司長顧葆常稱：民營工廠按照價配日本賠償機器目錄申請價購者，至今尙僅五家，不按目錄申請購買者，則已有五十餘家，預定不久當可更趨踴躍。至原定三月十五日申請截止，將予展延至機器售完時爲止。該批機器之估價已設評價委員會辦理，該會即可於日內成立，估價標準力求公平。此批機器照盟軍總部佔價，雖已較新機器便宜百分之四十，但因我方人員接收倉促，檢視容有不週，故決再予抑低。至中請價購之工廠，將於下月中旬彙齊審査。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕報戰東北流通券，將風法幣規定一定比率，在關內</p>
<h3>東北流通劵關內不使用</h3>
<p>使用一節，昨晨國一行張總裁，已聲明完全不確。</p>
<p>又央行某高級人員，證實山海關分行仍繼續收兌流通券，凡入關人士，均須將流通券換成法幣後進關。</p>
<h3>買戶觀望不動棉紗供國於求各支粗細紗價均下跌</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗布况，因同業銀根緊迫，人心頓覺虛軟，多頭頻頻吐售，塲內賣氣籠罩，買戶觀望不動，市呈供過於求，喊價急轉直下。四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開一億令八百萬元有人賣出，吃戶甚稀，最後做一億零二百萬元有成交，較之週末跌二千萬元之鉅。其餘各支粗細紗現貨及棧單，立均劇瀉自三四百萬至八百餘萬元不一。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例開紗十種，共售八六〇件，合廿支紗一二〇〇件，廿支紗開價五七〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>布疋下挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以紗管當局嚴査倉庫及布號業賬册，人心渙散，更因市上銀根驟緊，各方交易呆頓，客路僅漢口帮零星有進，塲內出多進少，行情疾退。十二磅龍頭細布，晨開時價做二百六十萬元，一路下瀉至二百四十二萬元收市。較之週六，猛挫二十八萬元之鉅。其餘各檔細布及嗶嘰直貢元布斜紋，亦均直瀉自十萬至廿三五萬元不等，惟士林布脚地獨堅。</p>
<h3>呢絨奔騰不已</h3>
<p>呢絨嗶嘰行情，運日奔騰，上漲之鉅，堪稱向所罕見，前後統扯一週內共計騰漲五成有餘。此次猛漲之原因，多數係受流言謠傅所造成，米價及其他物價狂漲，與生活指數增高，亦大有影響。目下零蔓交易，咸有被迫而相繼軋停之勢力</p>
<h3>人造絲挫跌廠經交易寂寥</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市續吿挫跌，因外匯定購人絲，定於今日繳付關稅，故各方納胃頓呆。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤在三千八百萬元左右，最小價降至二千五百萬元即期款，午收回升做九百五十萬元隔日期，下午較振，最後爲三千一百萬元賣出價，結果仍比上週六短去一千二百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市交易寂靜，因銀根忽緊，且人造絲低落，以致均存觀望。各級喊價俱較上週六降四五百萬元之譜，高零祖即期五千五百萬元，有担成交。干經亦乏交易，喊價亦短去二千三百萬元不等。</p>
<h3>臺煤的新生與扶植</h3>
<p>（續昨）</p>
<p>（三）貸款的舉辦：該會現行舉辦之貸款，計有二種，一爲存煤貸款，一爲增產貸款。所謂存煤貸款，即對山場及車站之存煤貸放款項，使業者不至因資金週轉困難而不能繼續生產，此項貸款在收購貨款內扣除，目的爲使生產者有足够之流動資金，以供運用，而不必俟交貨後始能取得價款。此項貸款總額現有十二三億元合幣之鉅，如折合法幣約爲一千二三百億元，對於業者實不無相當之補助。增產貸款，爲協助業者擴充設備，改善工程，或開發新坑之用。此項貸款，已由該會洽得合灣銀行同意，本年度開始以低利貸放，凡確屬增產用途者，均可取得此項便利　此外復有新坑開發補助，深斜坑補助，與遠距離降炭補助等，均由該會與建設廳會同辦理。對礦工福利亦極注意，曾經該會商得煤業公會同意，規定以外銷盈餘百分之十五爲礦工福利金，交由公會分配發給。並由該會洽准糧食局配給平價米，所有礦業員工，每人每月配給平價米三十合斤，其他各業工人，聞尙未能有此項優遇，此亦爲該會在激勵生產目的所實施之辦法。</p>
<p>基上所述，合煤的新生，並不是得諸偶然，而是各方共同努力換來的代價。（完）</p>
<h3>上月運滬煤斤加多配售價增三成半煤球零售價每擔四十五萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據燃管會息：二月份各地到滬煤斤，共達十三萬餘噸，內包括由秦皇島遝滬者約六萬噸，由塘沽運滬者九千六百噸，台煤四萬餘噸，華東煤一萬五千噸，較一月份到滬煤斤總額，已超過三倍。</p>
<p>開經濟部對於本月份配售價格，陳部長在滬時，曾決定暫允增加三成，以减輕公用事業及生產事業之負担。但各地礦商，以近來麵粉價格及生活指數，提高甚鉅，若增加三成，於成本不敷，要求改增六成左右。</p>
<p>茲悉：陳部長已於昨日下午三時電達該會，着增加三成半。該會於接電後，即邀各廠駐滬代表，包括開　華東淮南等，召開會議，說明原委。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市物價評議會燃料小組，昨日下午三時，在社會局舉行第二十次評議會，決定調整機製煤球價格爲廠盤每噸自車價七百八十萬，送到另加十二萬元。零售價每擔四十五萬元，待呈經吳中任委員核准後施行。</p>
<h3>燃料飛俏</h3>
<p>昨日煤斤市况，以到稀存薄，喊價迭漲不已。做開焦作白煤塊每噸猛升一百萬元，爲一千三百萬元。芙蓉白煤七百八十萬元，萍薌烟煤售一千一百萬元，大同一千二百萬元，徐州焦炭八百萬元，其餘各種烟白煤及屑子，亦均挺秀，較之週六，續漲一成之譜。</p>
<p>煤球廠盤做開每噸昂至七百九十二萬元，零售每擔四十五萬元，較前上升有五成之鉅。</p>
<p>柴炭市面，以到稀銷暢，行情增高，栗柴每擔漲至二十萬元，松柴十七萬一元，靑炭每擔七上萬元，白炭六十一萬元，亦升二成左右。</p>

<h3>論學術的總一性</h3>
<p>— 洪謙</p>
<p>嚴羣先生在本刋第七期在他的大作「由旦體到抽象」一文內，將學問分做知與行的兩方面：「知的方面的學問爲現代的純粹自然科學，行的卞面的學問是現代的應用科學。」本文　對象，是在討論這個知與行兩方面的學問的關係是　樣？是分離的抑是整個　？是獨立的抑是總一的？</p>
<p>從一般人的心目中而言，這兩方面的學問，是具有原則上的不同，甚至於對立。　如說吧：知的方面的學問，是偏重於理論上的研究和探索，其目的是在對於實際問題建立其種理論的體系或系紡。行的方面的學問，則備　於社會上的普遍而經濟的普遍而經濟的一實用」，其目的則在於對於實際生活上的影響和效果。但是這是對於學問的知行兩方面的關係一種正確的看法麽？</p>
<p>依照筆者的意見，不特純粹自然科學與應用科舉，是不能獨立的，不能分離的，就是整個偏重理論系統的研究的「學」，如哲學文學歷史學文化科學自然科學等等，與整個偏重社會應用的「術」，如在應用科學以外的一切社會科學的理論硏究結論在實際上的應用（如經濟科學中之「經濟總制」工商管理等如政治科學中之「人口統制」「行政組織」），也都是整個的總一的。請詳言之吧：</p>
<p>一般人認爲學術之無總一性和整個性的主要原因，就是在於「學」之各科和「術」之各科對於社會「實用」上的差別。牠們這樣的差別，不特在學術和技術範圍內不難看到，就是在同一的學術領域內，也顯而易見。我們不是時常聽到學文科的人不如學理科的人有用麼？譬如說學物理的人總可以接電綫或裝無棧電，學生物的人總能辨別毒害病蟲。但是學文學的人未必每個人都能刻圖章寫　屛對子。學哲學的人對於社會一般人的興趣，遠抵不上街坊上的相命先生和占卦居士。不過學工科的人比學理科的人更有用了。他們不只是如學理科的人對於若干技術工業的對象，能一知半解的認識和應用，牠們學成以後，簡直可以造出許多奇奇怪怪的東西出來，用以解決社會生活中的衣食住行，以及相關的問題。譬如說鐵路汽船汽車飛機，縫衣機電報電話電燈等……諸如此類，實不勝枚舉了。</p>
<p>這是我們從「實用」上看到「學」「術」中有如此的鴻溝，有如此的差別，不過我們從原則上理論上去看「學」術的關係，則就不同了。何以理科之學，對於實際較之文科之學爲有用呢？工科之學又較理科之學爲有用呢？從原則上理論上而言，是因文理工各科之爲科學之各種對象，能和協的互助，能交互的影響，能在學術的總一性範圍內合作，能並行不悖，能殊途同歸。譬如說談到「學」位於諸學頂尖之「學」——自然是哲學。哲學是歐洲科學之起源，科學是從哲學蛻化而來。希臘時代的自然哲學，就是包括了哲學與科學兩大部份。就是當時的哲學家，也就是當時的科學家，唯心論的哲學家柏拉圖是一位幾何學家，唯物論者德謨克力多是原子論創見者，也是一位科學家。亞里士多德自然是歐洲科學初期一位大科學家，他的自然科學觀，一直到文藝復興，還爲人所遵守。就以近代哲學來說，也還是如此的。笛卡兒是分析幾何發現者，司賓諾莎是一位光學家，來勃尼茲是與牛頓同時發現微積分者。大哲學家康德也是一位大科學家，他的星雲學說，簡直能與來普來司的相提並論。現代哲學家如露灼費希勒馬赫，或爲醫學家，或爲生理學家，或爲物理學家。當代哲學家，羅素懷德黑石里克凱韋柏魏思曼或是數學家或物理學家。當代大科學家愛因斯坦的著作，關於哲學的並不比純粹科學的爲少。總之我們從未見過對於文理之「學」有所輕重，而對於文理之「學」能有發展的，亦未見文理之「學」之有發展，而對於文理之學有輕重之分的。事實具在，豈容懷疑麽？</p>
<p>關於文理之「學」之不能分離獨立，之不容從「實用」上有所判斷，我們有了以上的認識，已能因之了解學術總一性的意義。但是，假如我們轉視理科之學與工科之學的關係，則對於這一點更加顯而易見，更加徹底的認識了。</p>
<p>所謂工科之學或者應用科學，實際上就是以自然科學之原理原則在實際各方面的應用。譬如心理學生物學之於醫學，物理化學之於藥學，數學物理化學之於工業科學，化學生物土壞氣象學之於農業，天文學海洋學之於航空學航海術。至於科學方浩在工藝上之效用，則如由金礦物取金的冶化法，輪質與其誘導體之技術發展，電氣化學工業，以及製鋼法之改良。又如許多物質如藍靛等以前皆取之於自然產品，現則應用綜合的方法製造了，還有利用空氣中之淡氣製造肥料，亦皆足資以證明。華勒士敎授在所著「驚異的世紀」一書中，曾將十九世紀以前諸世紀之科學的實際應用作一比較，同時確定十九世紀的重要發明有鐵路汽船電報電話安全火柴煤氣燈電燈攝影術留聲機X光綫光譜分析麻醉藥克腐劑之十三種，但在以前僅有望遠鏡印刷機指南針阿拉伯數字字母書法蒸汽機晴雨表之七種。華勒士如此以一世紀之十三種對前諸世紀之七種對比，雖然太尊重十九世紀而輕視了以前諸世紀，但由之當可證明某世紀之科學進步如何與某世紀實際發明之關係。實如同形影，是不可分離的。</p>
<p>惜乎多年來傾向，「學以致用」的人們，人多忽略了應用科學與自然科農如此的關係，而認爲工科之學有獨立發展之可能性。殊不知工科之學之爲應用科學如無科學理論爲其根據，無科學方法爲之輔助，則根本無應用之可言，則根本失其爲應用科學之意義。希臘之發現圓錐曲綫律，固非實用者，但吾人如言及橋樑或于彈之曲綫　迫及航海術，則必聯想及這個圓錐曲綫律。航海綫一部份是根據於天文學，天文學則以開由兒的定律爲基礎。但是開白兒定律之中心點，僅在於他使能應用演繹法從圓錐曲綫中，推知太陽繞行於以太陽爲交叉點之一橢形軌道上，所以天文學家拉普斯曾說過道：「假如無希臘人發現圓錐體切面形構成之切綫，則這個精確的天文定律無由以生。」通常認爲足以改變人生之蒸汽力電報電話與動力發動機，此皆由熱學電氣學光學之理論硏究而來。湯姆生對於電氣震動說之爲數學之分析，何人知其中已具有無錢電之基礎。賈法尼之哇體痙　研究，斯米司之英格蘭地層探訪，皆出於理論的好奇心，雖知其一我們能用之以導發電報，其一則對於英國礦業之開採，實効如何的大。光譜分析的方法，亦出於理論的觀察，誰能知其能應用於發現煤質焦油中頁庫含有許多混合物，這些都是開始不爲「實用」而終於有「實用」者之明證了。</p>
<p>綜以上所言而論，即能明瞭「學」與「術」是根本不能分離的，獨立的，是整個的總一的。牠們是學術硏究上不同的表現，人類文化生活上應有的內容。所以眞正學術發達的國家民族，無不有「學」與「術」兩方面的特殊創造和發明；眞正有文化生活的社會環境，亦無不有「學」與「術」雙方面的精神傳統和實踐技能。吾國過去由於不了解學術的總一性，听以曾有一時重視文科之學而輕視理工科之學，又有一時恰好與此相反，於是數十年來無論對「學」或「術」提倡的結果，都是貧乏到可嘆可憐，所以我們對於學術總一性的應有了解和認識，實是當今的急務。</p>
<h3>城市與鄉村居民被炸智力比較</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>鄕下人的呆頭呆腦，在都市居民中，曾留下不少的笑話。鄉下人是否比城裏人笨？在成就上說，這似乎沒有疑問的。在國內，潘光旦與費孝通對於科舉的統計，即已證明城市人確佔優勝。美國一個心理學家，卡推爾J．McK．Cattell，他所編的美國科學名人錄中，統計在美國出生的科學家共八六六名，但在一九〇〇年就有二萬五千名人口以上的城市，要佔二二四名。這些城市人口的總計不過鄉村人口六分之一，而所產生的科學家則超過鄕村的三分之一，顯然，城市有比鄕村更易產生大科學家的條件。但這些條件是人爲的呢？還是天生的？卡推爾本人是偏向於環境的說法，所以他用「人口密度，財富，機曾，社會風氣和理想」等來說明這些城市與鄉村人口成就同差異。我們在下面要討論一下這種看法的理由。</p>
<p>自從智力測驗盛行以後，對於城市與鄕村居民稟賦的差異，硏究極多，茲舉博克W．F．Book一調査爲例，以無其餘：</p>
<p>到十四歲止，城市兒童都比鄕村兒童的均數高，鄕村兒童祗有百分之廿四能够趕上城市的中等兒童。這似乎證明一般流行的見解，城市兒童確實稟賦較優秀。十四五歲以上，鄉村兒童似乎已趕及都市兒童，且有軼出之勢。其實，這後來的傷勢，祗是一種幻覺。原因是十四五歲以後，在美國的鄕下，大多數兒童不復進學校了。留在學校的便都是優秀些的，而測騐是在學校舉行的。這種選擇作用使鄕村兒童在統計的表面上看來，似乎超過城市了。所以智力測騐的結果，　致可以說仍是城市優於鄕村。</p>
<p>在英國的蘇格闌，湯馬遜G．H．Thomson領導過一個比較更爲精密的調查。他不但發現鄉村兒童的智力比城市兒童低，而且離城愈近的智力愈髙，愈遠的愈低。（這一切自然都指平均數而言。）這種程度的差別，更是許多人相儲『血擇地』Blood　seaks　environment　說法。換言之，鄕村與都市居民智力的髙低，不是環境所造成的，而是由於鄕村中的優秀人物都向城市中跑，剩在鄕村中的都是一些比較低能的。這種淘汰然，很爲一般主張遺傳論者所倡道，國內潘光旦與費孝通諸人，似乎都有如是的傾向。但近來社會學家與社會心理學家，對此亦有很强有力的反證。例如哥侖比亞大學的克闌潑克敎授O．Klineberg在其種族差異Race　Differences一書中對於黑人的調査，似難作如上的解釋。</p>
<p>黑人居住城市年數與智力表</p>
<p>智力髙低乃與居住城市的年數成正比，這便不得不使人懷疑先天的智力髙低說，而使人相信城市與鄕村的環境是產生智力不齊的原因。城市的交通方便，社會刺激頻繁，而且文化水準，高得多，受敎育的仍會多多了，這都可以使一個人在智力上佔便宜。因爲都市對於文化人　機會好，所以大衆對　敎育也比較熱心，大家都有向理智方面求發展的願望。這一切都說明城市環境對於智力的刺激。但此外尙有一個重要原因爲過去心理學家所忽視的，就是智力測騐的材料都取自城市，一些觀點往往祗有城市兒童才能了解的。例如智力測驗中有一個造句測驗如下：</p>
<p>上下我鄉去早</p>
<p>這個測驗的答案自然是「我早上下鄕去」。但這個口吻完全是城市兒童的口吻，鄉下兒童決想不到的。因爲鄕下兒童的經驗祗有「我早上進城去」，或「我早上上街去」。鄕下兒童在這一類的智力測驗中失敗便毫不足奇。我們如果都選用鄉村兒童的生活資料，用鄉村所習見的事物，來編製測驗驗，結果或許鄉村兒童的智力反高於城市兒童。如此，我們更無法確言鄕村兒童的智力是天生不如城市的了。環境的不同，或者是更基本的原因。</p>

<h3>何謂不朽</h3>
<p>— 佐禹</p>
<p>「不朽」或「不死」，這是每一人內心的深處都希望着，只要這是可龍的話。但何謂不朽？或不巧的意義是什麽？這便各有不同的答案。西洋人有西洋人的答案，中國人復有中國人的答案。</p>
<p>西洋人的答案是，不朽就是靈魂的不朽。唯有靈魂才有不朽的可能。這種靈魂不朽說，自古代的希臘哲人，一直到近代基督敎的神學家，都太多數這樣主張着。這是西洋玄學上的一個主要問題，傳統哲人總得加以一種解釋的。</p>
<p>中國人的答案是，不朽乃是子孫生命的延續。不朽的問題，即是有後無後的問題。如我們有子有孫，我們的生命便寄託於子孫生命之中，由子孫生命的延續而延續。子孫復有子孫，子孫之生命無窮，我之生命乃　窮。故中國人生子必求其食己，亦必求其能繼志遠事，克紹箕裘，目的就是要解決一己的不朽問題。蓋假如子孫在肉體上和精神上都和自身相類似，豈不是自身便有了第二代或第三代的生命嗎？孟子：「不孝有三，無後爲大」之說，所以這樣着重「無後」，其理由也許在此。</p>
<p>除上述兩種答案之外，尙有第三種和第四種的答案。這兩種答案都是從生命的「影響」（Effects）上尋求不朽的。蓋每一物都有一物的影響，生命亦必有生命的影響。不過，生命的影響却可分爲精神的和物質的。自生命的精神影響言，這種影響是可以不朽的。所謂精神影響的不朽，就是我國古代所謂「立德，立功，立言」的三不朽。道種三不朽是生命的精神活動所造成，且爲少數傑出之十所獨有，不是每一人所能有。雖每一人都必有所言，有所爲，然每一人的所言所爲，不兌得都能不朽，也即不見得都能使後代的人受其影響，而去崇拜他或紀念他。故凡古人之能受今人的崇拜或紀念的，就是獲得了這種不朽的。這是最可珍貴的不朽。</p>
<p>自生命的物質影響言，這種影響是一定不朽的。所謂物質影響的不朽，即是生命之爲物質活動的一種事實所造成。一有生命，即有這種事實，而這種事實，對以後的事實，必可發生多少影響。這也就是說，任何一塊物質的活動，必可使其四周原子電子的排列有所不同，而這種不同，又必可使以後所有原子電子的排列，仍有多少微細的不同。所以只要宇宙一日存在，而這種物質影響也就一日存在。這可說是最悠久而又是最無意義的不朽。</p>
<p>何謂不朽的問題，以上已提出了四種答案：一是靈魂的不朽，二是有後的不朽，三是精神影響的不朽，四是物質影響的不朽。第一種不朽，依乎靈魂之有無，而這是一個疑問。第二種不朽也許不甚可靠，因子孫的有無，自身沒有十分的把握。第三種不朽是有希望而且要努力的。至第四種不朽，則是不費力，最可靠，却是絕無價値的。因而我們要追求不巧的話，我們所當追求的，乃是第二種及第三種的不朽。</p>
<h3>學林樷話（十一）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>建國精神與贛路</p>
<p>現在大家都講建國，但建國不貴空談，而尙實踐。作者生平景佩二位張先生，一位是興辦南通實業的張季直先生，一位是創辦浙贛鐵路（初名杭江鐵路）的張靜江先生。作者對於南通張　，曾有一段頌辭，照錄如左。</p>
<p>「張季直先生隱居南通，「耕　寬閒之野，釣寂寞之濱，」使官僚政客處此，必不堪其憂，而張氏正爲奮發有爲之時。張氏當謂地方自治須謀基本，　本之策無過於地。光緒二十七年，張氏開辦通海墾牧公司，時人稱其墾荒事，變斤鹵爲　腴，足與范公爭烈。江北范公堤者，爲宋范文正公築，又名捍海塘，用以捍禦　潮者也。綿　　甯鹽城東台南通各縣，長凡四百餘里，至今堤址猶存。宋代以後海濱漲，范堤去海，寬者一二百里，最狹者亦數十里，其地苦　，又乏堤岸，無以禦海潮，致一片荒灘，並草不生。張氏着手之初，開關河道以利灌漑，修築堤岸以絕潮患，　質較重不易耕耘之地，先　淡種靑，變化土貨。其已生茅草，　氣將盡之地，則巡招佃施墾，相其土宜，種種　棉。光　三十一年，値大風潮，張氏親出巡海，曰「毋餒！以辦事人之心血，士夫之肩皮，與海潮相搏戰。」又言一毋躁，須十年規模乃粗定，更五年規　備，更五年功效成。」張氏之大志，欲新墾一千五百萬　面積，每人占地二十畝，　容七十五萬人。現張氏計劃尙未元全實現，而自南通北至阜寗，大小錯落，新建設鹽墾公司已不下二十餘所，墾民不下數萬人，各公司所組織之新村新鎭，大都人烟稠密，但因成立不久，坊間地岡多未載入。「各堤之內，樓人有屋，待客有室，儲物有倉，種蔬有圃，佃有廬舍，商有塵市，行有塗梁，若一小世界矣·」世人頌之曰，「范公堤外張公墾，飽腹心心十萬家。」張氏此舉，可使世界各國知中國人非盡懵於農墾計劃者。』</p>
<p>『吾嘗謂新時代之政治家，與舊式官僚不同之點何在乎？吾以爲舊式官僚所致力者，僅爲人與人之關係，新時代之政治家，則當致力於人與天然之關係。新式的政治家亦講逢迎，但並非逢迎上司及其同僚，其所欲逢迎者，上則天時，下則地利。新式之政治家亦講奔走，但不願奔走於煙貴之門，其所願奔走者，乃河山江海與廣漠之野，欲與人民共謀天然富源之發展，以爲國利民福而已。准此而論，近代中國實際政治家，吾必以南通張賽爲第一人。』（東西洋滄桑之感，時代公論第十期，二十一年六月十日）</p>
<p>國父稱縣爲建設中國之眞正基礎，張南通的事業，確是建國的奠基工作·國父又設振興實業當先以交通爲重要，計劃交通當先以鐵道爲重要。蓋一經一緯，就地域言，以分縣爲基本，就事業言，以鐵道爲先鋒，這是建國的至理名言。過去中國許多鐵道幹綫之中，最能發揮建國精神的要推張靜江先生所手創的浙贛鐵路。現値該路舉行杭州南禺段復路通車典禮，不可不說幾句話以資紀念。</p>
<p>浙贛路的精神便是埋頭苦幹的精精，要快幹，要實幹，有遠大計劃，能於遠處着眼，近處着手，故能着着成功。現在我國正當內憂外患交迫之時，環境極爲困難，但非實行建設便不足以挽救危局·而當前建設非有苦幹精神，勢必至於一籌莫展，所以當年浙贛路建築的經過，實爲目前極可寳貴的經騐。浙贛路第一段自杭州到江山，稱爲杭江鐵路，是民國十九年張靜江先生任浙江省主席時所倡議。十九年之三月興修此路僅有工款二十萬元，到七月間通至諸暨，艱苦情形可以想見。張氏嬋精竭慮，別樹一格，敷設三十五磅輕軌，務期節省初期建築的經費，但仍勿使妨碍將來的擴充與發展，杭江鐵路每公里的工程及設備平均僅費三萬六千元，較之國有各路每公里成本在九萬元以上者便宜多了。杭江路又自江山西展至江西玉山，稱杭玉段，完全爲浙江省政府的修築。玉山以西的路綫則由鐵道部與浙江江西省所合力經營·浙贛路一詞，始於民國二十三年之春，玉山至南昌段，長二九〇公里，歷時一年又半，於二十五年一月十五日通車，費用一千八百萬元。該段改用六十三磅重軌，故成本較大，平均每公里約合六萬元，實不爲多。</p>
<p>過去我國鉅大工程類多借重外人，杭江路及後來浙贛路的建築，不假外力，不借外資，由中國工程師自行設計，除鋼軌車輛機件及橋樑材料，因本國尙無出品，不得不向外國定購外，在可能範圍內，儘量採用國貨，以期减少漏巵，鋼梁材料雖未自德國，而分發於本國工廠承做。其後錢江大橋的建造，仍本此一貫精神，使自力建國的信心大爲加强。當時政府財政困難，無力投資於鐵路，但聚有遊資之銀行界，因該路的建築，引起了投資的興趣，該路亦能保持對外債務的信用，因此得以繼續借款，向西展築。該路資金之獲有來源，乃由於國內金融界之協力贊助。據民國二十四年度報吿，由杭州至南昌六百六十公里，全路員工共四千人，比較其他各路更見緊縮。髙級幹部頗能刻苦自勵，爲全體員工之表率，服務精神頗爲時人所稱許·</p>
<p>浙贛路興修尙在江西剿匪時期，匪患以外，復受水災疫癘的侵凌。南昌玉山段開工時，江西東北部殘匪未淸，時出滋擾，甚至據殺該路及包商員工，因之工程進展時受阻碍。嗣徑向當地駐軍接洽保護，並在該路沿綫擇要建築碉堡二十八處，分兵駐守，始得繼續進行。同時又以該段農民旣遭匪患，復受畢災，流離失所，生機斷絕，經與當局商洽，盡量舉辦工賑，以資救濟。總計南玉段的建築，死於水死於匪死於疫者約二千人左右，卒賴靈策羣力，不避艱險，以底於成，這也是很可稱道的。</p>
<p>浙贛路營業方針，在於推銷國貨，以副振興本國實業的使命。故於重要各站設立營業所，爲滬杭國貨工廠產品謀推銷之便利，極力减低運費，以期减輕成太，俾與舶來品相競爭。至沿綫各地之重要特產，曾舉行浙贛特產展覽會以資宣傳，並於沿綫各站組織運銷合作社，代　運費，集中貨物，訂定低廉簡明合理化之運輸價目及鐵路公路水路之聯運辦法，以期增加鐵路營業，並協助地方經濟的復興。鐵路本是一種工具，他的目的在改善民生，繁榮地方，對於沿綫各地的特產，應設法增加其產量，改進其品質，推廣其市塲。鐵道不但爲發展省際貿易的媒介，我國對外貿易全賴特產出口以資挹注，鐵路對於國際貿易更應重視。浙贛路局成立之始，即能注意此點，這是很正確的方針。浙贛路治綫經濟地理有系統的關査，工業區位的精密估計，以及各種生產事業的多方提携，當然還等待今後的繼續努力。</p>
<p>浙贛路歷史尙淺，中經戰事，阻力甚多，我們自不容以現有的成績爲滿意。但目前建國時期各種事業，常感覺計劃雖多，而實行的毅力，尙不足以副之。因此對於張靜江先生以及許多繼承者的奮鬥精神，不能不表示十二分的欽佩。</p>

<h3>知識者的困境</h3>
<p>— 玄玄</p>
<p>我無知識階級是脫了節了。對舊而言，它已失去了士大夫的傳統的權利。對新的而言，它只能在這資本主義的社會裏，担任一個極小的角色，譬如機關中的小公務員，工商業中的書記文牘之類。至於純粹一點的知識分子，譬如作家，記者，敎師等等，在經濟上說，他們也只是一些倚存的人物，決不是主管的首長，也不是比較「實惠」的勞力者。他們大都只以一點在這個社會可有也可無的本領來賺一口粗茶淡飯。可是社會太不安了，社會越不安，他們越沒有辦法，越關得可憐。</p>
<p>筆者有一個朋友，本來是弄文藝的，近年來鑒於文藝之無出路，改行做單帮。一做單幫，臉色便較以前紅潤。還有一個寫文章的朋友，他的文章雖不見得驚天地而泣鬼神，但在一個文明社會裏，這樣的作品是決不嫌其多的，可是他現在每天坐在證券號子裏，凝視着行情板上的數字。如果他生在美國，至少生活是不成問題的。但在中國，我們却並不需要他的幽默感，也並不需要他的機智，但他倒必需一個職業　，旣沒有固定的職業，那末投投機也許是他唯一的出路，雖然投機決不於社會有利。</p>
<p>一般的知識分子，固然沒有了不起的學問，也許只多明一點事理，多懂一點大事而已，但在中國這個文盲佔八十以上的社會裏，却可能發生極大的作用。一心向善，雖然未必能安邦定國，但一心向惡，則吳用和牛金星輩，却都算是「讀書人」的。</p>
<p>這實在是一個不堪的局勢。</p>
<p>在這個社會中，知識益豐富，當然吃虧愈厲害，這我們不必諱言。但在上者却不能無視於此種學實，腦滿腸肥的商人固然可以笑知識分子「活該」，但在當軸，却決不能作如是想，它至少得做到截長補短，做一點「修正」現狀的工作，弗使有用者太吃虧。過去非知識分子太吃虧，其後果我們今日已够領略，如今反其道而行之，後果也許會更可怕的。</p>
<h3>不買書的原因</h3>
<p>— 葉君</p>
<p>二十五日則仕先生在本刋發表了一篇「中國人與書」的大作，對於中國人之讀書，一口咬定「這是中國人不喜讀書之故，亦即無求知心之微。」這所謂中國人，如僅指非公一務員的中國人，我暫不敢置可否，如係包括公務員在內，則說他們都是「不喜讀書」或「無求知心」，我便不收局同了。何則？聽我道來。</p>
<p>我雖尚非公務員，但我係公務員之子，我們是書香門第，父　喜讀書，我也喜讀書，所以我　實在也讀了些書，不敢說什麽學富五車吧，而黑墨汁藍墨水也着實喝了些下去；不用說，我們是喜歡買書的。但事實上買書沒有呢？答曰：幾月以前還買了一兩本，一百多天以來，可就半本都沒有買，爲什麽？沒有錢也。</p>
<p>我們時常在報紙上的出版界　刋內看到書的介紹，想買，而無錢買；我們時常在廣吿上看到一册一册的書名，想買，而無錢買；我們時常在書店內把書東翻西轉，想買，而無錢買；我們時常商討着要買什麼書什麽書，結果是因無錢而什麽書都沒有買。</p>
<p>不錯，則仕先生的甲兄不是說了嗎？「我的買書之錢就在可省可不省項下節約出來者。例如你吸慣白錫包，何妨改吸紅錫包，或一月改吸四次，省下錢來購一書，你坐三輪車的改坐電車，看慣頭輪電影院的改看末輪或不看若干次，餘類推。這樣的節約不損毫髪，而買書之錢就綽綽有餘了。」但是，我一家人不但不吸白錫包，也不吸紅錫包，就運黑錫包都沒得吸；出門不但不坐三輪重，就連公共汽車電車也少坐，多半的時候還是開「兩脚車」；說到有電影，除了我因別人送過我幾次軍人免費券而在星期日看過幾回外，我家人從未看過，根本不知何謂頭輪，孰爲末輪。儘管如此，導是沒錢·盗我們所用的錢，都是「決無可省者」，不但沒有用過「絕對可省者」，也沒用過「可省可不省者」的錢。</p>
<p>這筆賑我算給你聽：我家大小有七口，父親月入不到四百萬元，而每月需食米約一石三斗，除配給三斗外，尙須購買一石，需洋二百四五十萬元，（就算二百四十萬元吧）拿本月來說，除二百四十萬元購米外，我自己讀大學有公費不要　費，但我有一弟兩妹讀小學，市立小學每人繳費八十一萬元，三人便需二百四十三萬元，這樣一來，即已超過一月收入多多了。此外，能不賣小菜乎？能不理髪乎？能絕對不坐電車乎？能不與友人通信乎？有毛病能不服藥乎？那來錢買書！</p>
<p>所以，公務員不買書的原因，的確是爲了窮，至少我家如此，而如我之家，想來也不在少數吧！</p>
<p>書呀，書呀，我想買你而無錢，我想讀你而少綠。</p>
<h3>二南</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>關於儲南强先生的消息，日昨承老友方介堪兄見吿，仍隱居故鄕，並時通音問，不禁大喜；頃讀施先生大文，知簡翁老而彌健，雖人事滄桑，而洞天無恙，老友健壯。誠一大快事。</p>
<p>在民十七八年之頃，開發名山的風氣，可謂盛極一，時。吳稚老許靜老之於黃山，儲南强先生之於兩洞，蔣叔南先生之於雁岩，開闢這路，整治寺院，種藝樹木，招待遊客，刋印指南，經營鼓吹，不遺餘力，尤以儲蔣二先生均以一人的力量，鍥而不舍，卒能使兩洞雁蕩的名勝，大異於世，慕名往遊者，亦相繼不絕，而兩先生往往躬任招待這游之責，其熱心毅力，山靈有知，亦當感謝。</p>
<p>余之遊雁蕩，由於老友黃賓虹先生之介，於民二十之夏，偕畫弟子徐培基遵海而南，由永嘉樂淸入山，承叔南先生招待優　，並由其公子導游全山。余居山中匝月，畫成册頁六册，爲余實地硏究中國山水畫寫生的開始。至今靈岩靈峯，大龍湫，北石梁，凈石寺，老僧巖等尙爲余時作的書題。</p>
<p>叔南先生本習武事，雄才天略，顯以不合於時，鬱鬱不得志，曾在故鄉大荆附近，一舉而殲匪三百餘人，永嘉一帶匪患爲淸者數年。叔南先生豪於飲，其大荆亦游蕩廬及雁岩仰天窩中，均滿貯酒號。某年先生來上海，階賓虹先生飲於拋球塲某酒店，每罄一壺，則　置座上，二人且談且飲，座上壺滿，二人興尙未闌，余不能飲，僅以目飲，已有醉意，遂興辭先歸。逾數日偕叔南先生訪賓虹先生於西門路，時有友人所餽茅台數瓶，二人又復縱飲，僅餘半瓶，叔南先生持之而去，並懷余所作大龍湫一幅，車至半途，瓶忽失手而隊車上，及檢起瓶已破，餘瀝未盡，棄之可借，乃一吸而乾，及抵寓所，盡巳烏有，翌日述之，相與大笑。</p>
<p>今叔南先生墓木已拱，介堪云其大公子亦作古，而雁蕩山中今方有人嘯聚其中，欲重遊而不可得。聞南强先生健壯而喜，憶叔南先生懷沙而悲。余一生所遇雄傑豪放之土，當以二先生爲巨　，顯皆不能大有用於世，而獨與山林爲伍，二先生之不幸，亦國家之不幸也。</p>

<p>綺紈道：「你也想一想，從前是什麽時代，現在又是什麽時代？我不認識一兩個時代人物，便要受人魚肉了。尤其以我的立塲，無意之中，很容易得罪人·」渚齊聽了，又是一怔，問道：「據你這樣說來，你是永遠要在梨園佔一地位了！」綺執冷冷一笑道：「我不在本行努力，這一家叱什麽喝什麼？」渚齊見綺執所答的話，和平日所持主張，完全相反，一時得是氣忿，說道：「綺！我始終是愛護你的，無論你的環境，你的心理，變得如何程度，我都要保護你，免你走入歧途，你和這種名譽狼藉的人結交，與你的身份很有妨碍·」綺　聽了，默然不響。這時小王媽也走進來在旁說道：「我看那位　處長性情很畢躁，動不動開口便要罵人，我想老板……」綺執不待她說完，早瞪了一眼道：「你別多話！」小王媽給她說了一句，低下頭來，不敢再說，渚齊接着說道：「無論這人性情於躁不暴陳，總之和他們在一起，與你很不利，你的身份，和別人不同，以你老人家牌號拿出來，誰不敬重！再說你的前途，是無限量的，並不須仰仗這些武朋友保　呀！現在給報紙登了這一段新聞，外面人言嘖嘖，要解釋便得費事，我希望你懸崖勒馬，不要一誤再誤·」綺執道：「我有我的辦法，我不覺得有什麽錯誤，我知道我的名譽是很寳貴的，至不得巳時，也不會牽連到別人身上。」渚齊見綺執的話說得如此決絕，想要再說，她也未必接受，便氣忿忿站起來道：「我是誠心誠意來勸你的，這事有關你的名譽和你的前途，於我是沒多大關係的。」綺執道：「當然沒多大關係！」渚齊道：「這話是你親口說的，那末我已盡了我的忠吿，再見吧！」說着，悻悻走了·綺執也不理他，把嘴唇一　抿，眼看他出去。小王媽追送渚齊到門外，再三叮囑他明天再來，潽齋不顯而去。小王媽回到樓上，見綺紈伏在枕旁哭了！</p>
<h3>生活與教育</h3>

<p>—許壽裳教授被慘殺有感</p>
<p>「許先生是我殺　，你來捉我，我給你方便，不過請你答應我的要。第一，我的父母很窮，我有一萬多元臺幣及手表一雙，請你們派人送到我家裏；第二，讓我寫封信給雙親·如果你不答應，我死也不承認，或者自殺。」</p>
<p>「刑管答應了他的要求，他就寫了一封家信，大意是：「我愧對你們二位老人家，故這種參無人道的事，請以後不要想我。我所受的敎育也是白受的，請將我從前讀的書一起燒掉罷！」</p>
<p>臺大國文系主任許壽裳暗殺慘案破獲，兇手高萬　原來是一個靑年工友，因爲這座房子以前是臺省編譯館的，兇手留藏着大門上一個鑰匙，夜半入室行竊，被許先生在床上用電筒窺破，兇手一時情急，便抽身偑柴刀猛下毒手，一位訓誨不倦著作等身的學者，竟於兇手盲目之狂妄意識下慘死非命，殊屬人　之至痛與至哀！</p>
<p>據報載：兇手於殺死許先生後，非常恐懼與懺悔，所以被捕後承認：「我是該抵他一命。」嗚呼！國粹云亡，拿一個草包來抵命，眞如泰山與鴻毛之比，能抵償些什麽呢？</p>
<p>這個慘案之動機與肇端，實屬簡單，完全基於貧窮與下愚，以致在偷構失風時竟出之行兇，髙萬俥是死有餘辜的。可是，居然他於就逮時念念不忘於雙親，以餘錢及手表奉之父母，並且，恍然於「所受敎育也是白受，請將從前讀的書一起燒掉！」人，終究是人，有時悖謬理性，橫行不法，有時天良發現，視死如歸。髙萬俥就是人生矛盾尖銳化之一個　子。</p>
<p>許壽裳先生是一個純粹學者典型，文章道德，爲世所重，並且學生致力於敎育，不談政治，這次死得彌可悼惜！而最令人不能不有動於衷的，就是兇手所說一我所受的敎育也是白受，請將從前讀的書一起燒掉！」那髙萬倬在知罪以後，殆也有感於敎育無靈，枉生天地了！</p>
<p>敎育！敎育！於今之世，敎育俱是什麼「名堂」呢？生活的鞭子，逼得受敎育的人往往誤入歧途，不克自拔，我們於許壽裳先生暗殺案旣白，旣悲死者之枉死，亦悲生者之枉生，尤悲敎育前途之黯然無色！</p>
<h3>花事小說與味莼園</h3>
<p>— 俞逸芬</p>
<p>二十日本刋戴劉雁聲君滬瀆舊景一文，中有「至於飛車擁麗云云，吾人可於海上漱石生所著之九尾龜，及以滬語寫成之海上花列傳中見到當年景况」之語，實誤。按九尾龜作者張春帆先生（與筱丹桂之權夫張春帆姓字皆同），別署漱六山房主人，書中主人翁章秋谷，實以自况，予昔於寒雲林屋二師數相晋接，體肥碩，而目短視，窺然長者，初亦不似書中風流倜儻之人物也·至海上漱石生，則爲孫玉聲先生之別號，所著有海上繁華夢，及武俠小說仙俠五花劍等，少時跌蕩花間，風流自惠，中年以後，即絕跡不事治游，故能腰腳輕　，老而不衰，剏繁華報，爲滬上有小型報之始，性尤獎掖後進，予於癸亥冬始識之，引爲忘年交，戰時病逝海上，年已八十餘矣。海上花列傳作者爲花也憐儂，首以蘇州方言入書，爲說部中別裁，經胡適之提倡，名始六著。繁華夢九尾龜中亦多用蘇白，以出版後風行一時，故續集甚多，予曩歲頗事嬉遊，好留心此中故實，願於三書皆以篇帙太繁，閱之軓未能終卷也。</p>

<h3>吾校之友</h3>
<p>— 雪學園</p>
<p>讀二月五日自由談版載孫鶴先生「記憶中凌　漢閣」一文，甚感相知之雅，又愧未能確知先生爲何人，「孫鶴」想係筆名（原文說是敎書同事，未明何校）。所記眞是條分縷析，穩洽周詳，亦有一二誤憶。老朽出身「北大」而非「北洋」，此事關係學籍，理　聲明一下。因即　談吾校及吾校之友。</p>
<p>吾校「北大」，不是　語，可稱全國首屈一指最老最大的最髙學府，由京師大學堂，（前淸譯名Imperial　Uniervsity）而北京大學校（民　譯名Govarnment　University後改譯Peking　University），由民國紀元前上年創　至今，已五十周齡大慶。前濟及民初期都城內只此一家，且與舊史之「太學」（即代表國家學府之國子監）同居唯一崇髙之地位。故一提「大學」或「大學生」無人不知，無須冠字，如歷史上之「禿頭無字大將軍」一般·「法門寺」劇中劉瑾所云「這份兒可够獲得啦！」</p>
<p>吾校之歷史的演進，分爲三期；（一）民元前十四年創辦時只因國都所在，需要一個崇髙特大的學堂，並未計及大學應具備何種條件，大學生應是何種程度，且中小學皆未興辦，沒有按級而升的各項學生，自不能有合格投考的大學生，故敎員與學生至爲複雜，有舊科舉之進士舉人，有同文館的算學生天文生，其課程，料目亦任意而爲。所謂「大學堂」。祇是「大的學堂」Large　School，非「大學」之堂Universituy也·直到民國紀元前三年，分科大學成立，乃爲名副其實的大學校。此爲第一期。（二）從分科大學開辦到民八改制，發生新文化運動，爲第二期。民八改制以後入於第三期，直至今日。（近三十年來，有些因政局變選而發生之沿革，如張作霖時代之恢復「京師大學」等不足稱階段，置之不論。）</p>
<p>老朽乃分科大學開辦第一次招生考入之一生。七科同學五百餘人，現在先舉我們土木工程科的幾位，畢業成績最優的夏昌熾（字光宇，江蘇靑浦人）在北京交通部任職數年，國都南選，又在南　　辦了許多有名工程，勝利後，並派爲華中一帶交通復員監與專員。（去年見報載，此名洞或與原職銜字不無出入。）我想大江南北知道他的人，不在少數。這位老同學光宇兄少年時代，溫文爾雅，　而且勤，大考當居榜首，戲呼爲「夏狀元」。「九一八」後來平一次，過訪暢談，今已多年不晤了。還有葉愼修（名永保，蘇州人，土木工程），王鑑淸（常州人，採鑛科）兩兄，都是蘇州髙等畢業升入北大的。其由廣東升學的老區（他的Nick　name呌Potatoe），老陳（伯玉），老李（文驥），及採鑛班的老李（伯賢），老麥，山東客籍髙等升入的老吳（次風），老張（荔塘），向在華中華南工程界服務。最近接到本報編輯部轉來老張一信，他在甘肅看申報，見了凌　漢閣記運北大工學院的文字，纔知老同學無恙。他們現在隴天水鐵路工程局幹本行事業，淸健如常。我另有獲信，修途遠隔，航訊無定，故於此處附載數語，並託他代向十幾位學兄道念。</p>
<p>彼時七科（照現制名稱則爲七個學院）同學人數衆多，難以遍識。尤其文科法科許多筆桿上的朋友，與我輩這些Engineers沒有切磋學術的聯采，無暇辨認。直到畢業後　年，我自己亦改了行，因別的機會，政學報界之酬酢，而會到幾位，經過他人之介紹，敍起來綫知道是最初同考取的同學，這裏不及一一說明。只舉出兩個「聞人」。一薰一蕕，一生一死。薰者生者老劉（名哲，字敬興，東北籍），現任監察院副院長，位望已隆，每詠「同學少年多不賤」之句，敬輿兄足以當之。他在民國十六年做敎育總長，我在兩個大學敎書，分位相隔，未曾通問。廿四年他做冀察政委會的委員，招待記者席上會過幾一次，談起馬神廟舊日情事，已不勝感慨。而今又履渡滄桑矣。蕕者死者則爲梁鴻志，　衆異，即僞維新政府之一口領，已伏國法，身名俱裂，咎由自取，不忍言之。此人曾做「僞　察院長」。敬與兄與此人之學誼，比老朽近一層，前後兩個蹤察院，又是一眞一僞，敬與於梁之　才與劣行，當更深惋歡也</p>

        <h1>1948.03.02</h1>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Reports on Military Suppression of Communists: Ensuring Stability in the Northeast and North China, Communist External Aid in Central China Has Been Cut Off</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] At the Central Memorial Week, Committee Member Bai Chongxi briefly reported on "Recent Communist Military Affairs," stating: (1) "Northeast Front": After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communists attempted to seize the Northeast. At that time, 116,000 personnel were transported to the Northeast by sea from Shandong and by land from Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou. In May of the 35th year (1946), after the National Army captured Sipingjie and Changchun, Lin Biao's Communist forces were demoralized and in disarray. At that time, it would have been possible to pursue the victory and capture Harbin, Manzhouli, and Jiamusi, annihilating all of Lin's forces. However, due to the influence of political negotiations, a ceasefire was implemented, allowing the Communists to spread and grow, leading to the current situation. The Northeast is a shield for North China. To protect North China, the Northeast must be secured. Historically, the Liao, Jin, and Manchu entered the Pass with the Northeast as their base. The Russo-Japanese War was also fought to gain control of the Northeast. Furthermore, the Northeast has a large amount of national defense resources, with an annual output of 3 million tons of iron, 26 million tons of coal, 19 million tons of grain, 3 million kilowatts of electricity, and 12,000 kilometers of railways. Its importance in national defense is self-evident. The General Headquarters attaches great importance to the current military operations to suppress the Communists in the Northeast and will make every effort to ensure the Northeast is secured.</p>
<p>(2) "North China Front": Currently, we still have a military advantage. On one hand, we are ensuring the political and economic center of the Tianjin-Beiping-Baoding triangle area. At the same time, we are developing from points and lines to strive for control of areas, in order to stabilize North China and support the Northeast.</p>
<p>(3) "Northwest Front": Currently, the military strength in the Northwest has an absolute advantage. The Ningxia and Qinghai provinces have a considerable number of cavalry, which are the most effective forces for suppressing bandits in the Northwest. Before the War of Resistance, Xu Xiangqian led a large number of troops to harass western Gansu, and was severely打击 by Qinghai province cavalry, nearly to the point of complete annihilation. Previously, Ma Jiyuan's troops eliminated a Communist regiment in Heshui with a small number of cavalry. Also previously, Ma Hongkui's cavalry in northern Shaanxi relieved the siege of Yulin, demonstrating their effectiveness. Currently, the Communist suppression military affairs in the Northwest only require unified command to eliminate the Communist bandits and consolidate the Northwest.</p>
<p>(4) "Central China Front": Shandong is the main battlefield for suppressing Communist bandits. Since Zhangjiakou was occupied by the National Army, the international route by which the Communists connected to Outer Mongolia has been cut off. Last year, we successively recovered Yantai, Longkou, and the Yimeng Mountain area, destroying the Jiaodong base area. The international maritime traffic through which the Communists obtained external aid has also been cut off, forcing them to flee south, infiltrating the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui in various directions. Liu Bocheng's bandit troops infiltrated the Dabie Mountain area. Chen Yi's bandit troops fled to western Shandong, northern Anhui, and eastern Henan. Chen Guang's bandit troops infiltrated western Henan, all to cover Liu's establishment of a base area in the Dabie Mountains. Tactically, they adopted the "three demands policy," namely demanding soldiers, demanding food, and demanding battles, coercing young men, seizing civilian guns, looting grain, and avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, using large forces to attack small forces, which the Communists call "airborne tactics." However, although the bandits fled south in various directions, their supply of weapons and ammunition is difficult, which is their fatal blow.</p>
<p>(5) "Regarding the Suppression of Communist Bandits in the Dabie Mountain Area": Since August of last year, Liu Bocheng led his First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Columns and the Central Plains Independent Brigade, successively crossing the Yellow River, passing through southwestern Shandong, and infiltrating the border areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan, joining forces with Li Xiannian's Twelfth Column, attempting to establish a military base area in the Dabie Mountain area. After Liu's bandit troops infiltrated the Dabie Mountain area, they looted civilian supplies, coerced young men, and seized grain, while dispatching a large number of village cadres to develop underground organizations, attempting to occupy the area for a long time, and cooperating with the two bandit units of Chen Guang and Chen Yi. Militarily, they attempted to block the Jinpu, Longhai, and southern sections of the Pinghan railways, cut off the waterways of the Yangtze River and the Hangzhou Canal, and waited for an opportunity to cross the Yangtze River to invade Jiangnan, threatening the capital to the east and Wuhan to the west,妄想 to realize their dream of crossing the Yellow River in the 36th year (1947) and the Yangtze River in the 37th year (1948). According to intelligence, the bandit leaders held a meeting in Jingfu, deciding that Liu Bocheng's bandit troops would establish a base area in the Dabie Mountains, Wang Hongkun's bandit troops would infiltrate the Tongbai Mountain area, Li Xiannian's bandit troops would infiltrate and cross the Yangtze River, Chen Geng's bandit troops would harass the Funiu Mountain area, and Chen Yi's bandit troops would conduct mobile operations to coordinate.</p>
<p>In order to crush Liu's attempt to establish a base area in the Dabie Mountains, our Supreme Command ordered me to organize the Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense, whose task was to break Liu's attempt to establish a base area in the Dabie Mountains, ensure the safety of Nanjing and Wuhan, and maintain the land and water transportation of the Yangtze River (between Nanjing and Hankou), the Pinghan Railway (between Hankou and Xinyang), and the Jinpu Railway (between Tianjin and Bengbu). The operational command range of the Jiujiang Command is south of the Huai River (the line of Bengbu, Zhengyang, Gushi, Xixian, and Xinyang), north of the Yangtze River, east of the Pinghan Railway, and west of the Jinpu Railway, with the Dabie Mountains as the main area, including parts of eastern Hubei, southern Henan, and western Anhui.</p>
<h3>The Communist Suppression Process in the Dabie Mountain Area</h3>
<p>Regarding the communist suppression combat progress in the Dabie Mountain area, after November 27th of last year, our troops gradually completed their concentration and began the encirclement. Liu's bandit troops were forced to cross the Ba River to the west and flee to the northwest, attempting to receive reinforcements from the 10th Column moving south from the Huai River. Our various units pressed from the north and south, forming an encirclement of Liu's main force north of Macheng and Zhubu, and south of Guangshan, Pihe, and Xuanhuadian, forming a strategically advantageous situation. Starting in December, Liu's bandit troops were forced to begin a partial centrifugal retreat, attempting to lure our main force to pursue and relieve the siege of their main force. Their deployment was to send the 10th and 12th Columns west to the Pinghan Railway, and two columns northeast to Guangshan, while their main forces, the First, Third, Sixth Columns, and the Independent Brigade, remained in the Dabie Mountains. At that time, the command secretly deployed a large force in the Liulin area in advance. The entire 10th Communist Column and part of the 12th Column, totaling more than 20,000 people, passed through Liulin on December 6th, and were annihilated by our army in a three-day-and-night battle. The number of Communist officers and soldiers killed was 9,325, including 316 officers and 3,562 soldiers. The captured materials included 5,920 rifles, 36 light and heavy machine guns, 16 artillery pieces, 150 horses, and many other military supplies and documents. The main force of the 10th Communist Column was destroyed by our army, and part of the 12th Column was defeated, and most of its combat capability was lost. The second battle was the battle of Queshan. On December 24th of last year, the First Communist Column fled north to Runan. The Third Division under the command of our Zhengzhou Command was frustrated near Xiping in order to coordinate with the defense of Yancheng. After the bandits barely escaped, they used the main forces of the First, Third, Fourth, and Ninth mixed teams, totaling about 70,000 people, to attack the Queshan defenders, our 20th Division, on the evening of December 28th. The division obeyed orders and was determined to hold firm. The command immediately ordered a strong force to Zhao Yue's operational area to rush to the rescue and lift the siege, and dispatched the air force to assist in the battle day and night. The officers and soldiers of our 20th Division fought bravely. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, our reinforcements advanced to the flank and rear of the bandits, in the Zhengyang and Minggang area, forming a strategic situation. The bandits collapsed. In this battle, more than 3,400 Communist officers and soldiers were killed, about 8,000 Communist officers and soldiers were wounded, 358 Communist officers and soldiers were captured, and a large number of military supplies such as heavy machine guns, rifles, and rifles were seized.</p>
<p>The above are the important combat experiences of Communist bandit suppression after the establishment of the Jiujiang Command. Smaller-scale battles are not detailed. Liu Bocheng, known for his cunning, graduated from the Soviet Red Army University and is a military theorist of the Chinese Communist Party. The Soviet Union praised him as one of China's strategists. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, Liu's bandit troops have repeatedly attacked the National Army. First, our 30th, 40th, and New 8th Armies were attacked between Xinxiang and Anyang. Later, in western Shandong, our 55th, 66th, 70th, and 32nd Divisions were successively defeated by them. Also, in eastern Hubei and western Anhui, one brigade each of our 40th, 52nd, and 88th Divisions also suffered setbacks. Liu is now the "Commander of the Central China People's Liberation Army." This time, when he infiltrated the Dabie Mountain area, his force totaled about 110,000 people. Since we began the suppression campaign, our main forces have been defeated in the past three months, with the total number of casualties and prisoners amounting to about one-third. They have now been forced to leave the core of the Dabie Mountains, dispersing into smaller units. This is a victory gained by relying on the virtue of the Supreme Commander and the dedication of the officers and soldiers. This has greatly boosted morale and strengthened confidence, believing that the bandits are not impossible to suppress, but can certainly be eliminated. However, one should not expect quick results. In the past, the war between the Xiang Army and the Taiping Army lasted fifteen years, and the Huai Army took eighteen years to suppress the Nian Rebellion. That is, from the 18th to the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1929-1933), our suppression of Communist bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui also lasted about five years. We are now dividing the areas to clean up this fleeing group of bandits in the Dabie Mountains. We are actively repairing roads, setting up communications, selecting strategic points, building fortifications, and deploying troops to defend them. At the same time, we are actively organizing the masses, leveraging civilian power, and cooperating with the military to eliminate the underground organizations of the Communist bandits. In this way, food, young men, and civilian guns will be controlled by us, and intelligence can also be blockaded, so that the bandits cannot obtain food from the people, coerce young men, or obtain intelligence, which is equivalent to fighting in the dark. We, on the other hand, are always proactive. Given a little time, we will surely be able to eliminate the remaining bandits. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Air Force Searches Mountain Areas in Southern Henan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 1st] Our Air Force dispatched batches of planes to southern Henan on the 1st to search for bandit tracks. North of Gushi and near Wulongji, hundreds of Communist military vessels fully loaded with supplies were discovered on the surface of the Huai River. They were immediately bombed, and the bandits suffered heavy losses. The counties in the Dabie Mountains and Dahong Mountains that were infiltrated and captured by bandits have been largely recovered in order. Currently, only Sui County and Xiangyang County still have bandits entrenched. As for Zhang Jian's unit between Yuan'an and Jingmen, there are only a thousand or so scattered bandits left, who can easily be wiped out.</p>
<h3>Wang Guoquan Leads Troops to Surrender, Self-Proclaimed "Democratic Allied Army" in Eastern Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] The work of eliminating bandits in Guangdong is actively underway, and the number of Communist soldiers surrendering is increasing daily. According to news from the Fifth Bandit Suppression District, Wang Guoquan's unit of the self-proclaimed "Democratic Allied Army," which had been infiltrating the Haifeng and Lufeng area, recently suffered heavy losses after being severely suppressed by the National Army. Wang Guoquan, realizing his mistakes, led Luo Jingmin, Zhao Zixin, and over five hundred others from his unit, carrying over three hundred rifles and many other weapons, to surrender and repent to General Yu Yingqi, commander of the district. Yu ordered them to proceed to Jieyang on the 1st to await reorganization.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] In order to unify the command and training of the armored forces, the authorities decided to establish the Army Armored Corps Headquarters in Nanjing, which was formally established and began operations on the 1st. Xu Tingyao was appointed as the commander, and the appointments of one or two deputy commanders have not yet been decided. Most of the staff of the headquarters are still scattered throughout the country and are coming to Nanjing one after another. The headquarters acknowledged the difficulties, but after receiving some American equipment from our troops stationed in India, it is now on a larger scale. Although warfare has now entered the atomic bomb era, atomic bombs cannot solve the entire battle, so armored forces still occupy an important position. Our country was originally behind other countries in armored forces, but we must catch up and strive to complete the mission of strengthening the suppression of bandits and establishing a new army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Zha Weiguo, commander of the First Armored Regiment, went to Hankou to inspect his unit some days ago, and has returned to Nanjing, departing for Xuzhou by train on the evening of the 1st to preside over the regiment's anniversary on March 3rd. During the war in northern Burma, he broke into the headquarters of the Japanese 18th Division on March 3rd of the 33rd year (1944) and obtained its seals, so this day was designated as the regiment's anniversary and is celebrated every year. In addition to holding a celebration this year, a group wedding will be held for the officers of the regiment. The ceremony will be simple and solemn, with innovative designs, and some tanks will participate in the ceremony.</p>

<h3>China Society for Social and Economic Research Formally Established in Beiping, Seeking a Bright Path for Various Domestic Problems</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] In the midst of domestic turmoil, the China Society for Social and Economic Research, initiated by Qian Changzhao, was formally established in Beiping. The society is composed of a number of domestic industrialists, professors, writers, and government officials. Qian Changzhao, Sun Yueqi, Zhou Binglin, Qian Duansheng, Shao Lizi, Zhu Zhongdao, Wu Jingchao, Zhu Guangqian, Xiao Qian, Cao Yu, Jin Yi, Tao Menghe, Fei Xiaotong, Pan Guangdan, Wu Yun Chu, Saishuzhi, Lu Zuofu, and Duan Xipeng are all listed as founders. At the upcoming general meeting of members, they will widely discuss their opinions on political, diplomatic, and economic issues, and will publicly publish them. In his opening speech today, Qian Changzhao explained that the motivation for forming the society was that "China's political, diplomatic, social, and economic problems are very complicated, the atmosphere is chaotic, and the general public feels very confused and bored." Therefore, it is necessary to gather like-minded friends to analyze China's major problems and grope for a path that may lead to light in the darkness. He also said: "We really want to find a new path, which is neither limited to the paths that have already been taken by people in the country, nor will it easily shift with the evolution of the international situation." He wants to "try to draw a blueprint for building a new China." The founding meeting was held at the Overseas Students Association at 2:00 PM on the 1st, attended by Zhou Binglin, Pan Guangdan, Sun Yueqi, and more than 30 others, and chaired by Qian Changzhao. After the constitution was adopted, the directors and supervisors were elected, including directors Zhou Binglin, Qian Changzhao, Wu Jingchao, Sun Yueqi, Xiao Qian, Pan Guangdan, Liu Dazhong, Qian Duansheng, Tao Menghe, Wang Chongzhi, and Lou Bangyan.

<h3>Luo Zhuoying Arrives in Beiping, Immediately Holds Joint Meeting with Li and Fu, Discussing Methods to Ensure Various Ports in Western Liaoning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 1st] Northeast Xing Yuan Deputy Director Luo Zhuoying passed through Tianjin on the 1st on his way to Beiping. On his way through Tanggu, he went to inspect the new port and told reporters that the situation in Huaiyin is stable, and a large number of National Army reinforcements are crossing the border. Important joint battles will be fought after the ice thaws.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Luo Zhuoying arrived in Beiping at 6:00 PM on the 1st and immediately held a joint meeting with Li Zongren, Fu Zuoyi, and others to discuss the integration of military affairs in North China and the Northeast and the methods to ensure the ports of western Liaoning, Huludao, Qinhuangdao, and Tanggu. Luo told reporters: (1) The Northeast and North China have become a single battlefield. Without the Northeast, there is no North China. The National Army is determined to make every effort to ensure the Bohai ports and western Liaoning. If the National Army controls the above-mentioned bridgeheads, it can fight the Communists outside the Great Wall and crush their attempt to enter the Pass and threaten Beiping. (2) In the past, the Northeast warlords took into account strategic and resource bases with limited troops, resulting in losing sight of one thing while attending to another. In the future, the troops should be concentrated to consolidate strategic bases, and the troops can be used flexibly. (3) There are no problems with the defense of Shenyang. The Communist bandits in Huaiyin still have an active plan to attack Shenyang. Whether the railway between Jinzhou and Shenyang can be opened depends on the arrival of reinforcements.</p>

<h3>National Army Sends Reinforcements from Rehe, Mechanized Units Recover Dahu Mountain, Communist Bandits in the Northeast Plan to Re-Attack Siping and Benxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] The new offensive that the Communist bandits are brewing is now apparent. The Communist bandits in the north plan to attack Siping, and in the east they plan to attack Benxi. The bandits who are gathering around Siping are parts of the 9th and 10th Columns, which have fled from the Kaiyuan area. In addition, there are the Independent 3rd, 4th, and 师 divisions, as well as the 2nd and 7th Columns harassing the north, now between Faku and Zhangwu, plotting to seize the transportation hub of Siping, causing the situation in northern Liaoning to become tense. It is said that the bandits have harassed Lao Siping, and fierce battles are expected in Siping within days. On the eastern front, Benxi, which was already isolated, is now being approached by most of the Communist 4th and 8th Columns from Yingkou. After the bandits planned to open the northern and eastern battlefields again, it is rumored that the Communist front-line command of Lin Biao has moved to Faku, north of Shenyang.</p>

<h3>The Death of Flying General Zhu Peifeng; Chiang Wei-kuo Painfully Recalls the Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Zhu Peifeng, Chairman Chiang's nephew, died in an accident on January 12 while piloting a transport plane, 20 miles west of Luoyang. Chairman Chiang was deeply saddened by the news; Zhu's friends were also deeply saddened. It is never easy for the nation to cultivate a talent. Moreover, a young man like Zhu, who was both academically and militarily accomplished and eager to learn, had unlimited potential. Now, he has unfortunately died young. Zhu's cousin, Chiang Wei-kuo, spoke to this newspaper today, still in deep mourning as he recounted Zhu's past. He was saddened by the loss of their friendship and pained by the loss of a talent for the nation. Zhu Peifeng and Chiang Wei-kuo were classmates at Soochow Middle School. After graduation, Wei-kuo continued his studies at Soochow University, while Zhu was admitted to the Civil Engineering Department of National Central University. After graduating from Central University, he went to study in the United Kingdom, specializing in architecture at the University of London and Cambridge University, where he obtained a bachelor's degree. This academic background alone was enough for a young man to develop his ambitions. When the War of Resistance broke out, Zhu happened to be in the United States for inspection. Realizing the severity of the national crisis, he decided to abandon his literary pursuits and join the military. He excelled in mathematics in school, and with this foundation, he studied "celestial navigation" in the United States. After graduating, he formally became a pilot, undergoing basic and advanced training, and then studying bombing. In 1943, he completed his studies and returned to China, serving as an operations staff officer in the Air Force Bombing Brigade with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He was stationed in Hanzhong, Liangshan, and other places, participating in numerous battles. In operations such as bombing Wuhan and bombing the Yellow River Bridge, Zhu flew his iron bird, dropping bombs on enemy construction works, striking the invaders. In 1944, he was sent to the United States to attend the Air Force Staff Class at the Staff College. After the victory of the War of Resistance, most of the personnel of the Bombing Brigade were reassigned to the Second Air Transport Brigade. He switched from bombing to transport, still serving as an operations staff officer, but by this time his rank had risen to Captain.</p>
<p>Soldiers originally dedicate themselves to the nation, and airmen are even more dangerous due to the nature of their duties. When they decide to become air warriors, they put life and death aside. Zhu Peifeng participated in air force operations for several years, braving dangers and escaping perilous situations several times, without diminishing his spirit. This time, however, it was an accident. In early January, he was ordered to transport gasoline from Xuzhou to Xi'an, arriving safely. On January 12, they flew back to Xuzhou from Xi'an in the same plane, with a total of six people on board, with no passengers or cargo. Suddenly, they discovered a serious malfunction in the plane. According to regulations, they could have abandoned the plane and parachuted, but Zhu Peifeng, in order to save the nation an airplane, tried to make an emergency landing. This was over the skies west of Luoyang. As they slowly descended, only two or three hundred feet above the ground, the plane suddenly caught fire and exploded. All six people on board, Zhu Peifeng, the co-pilot, two mechanics, and two communications officers, were all killed.</p>
<p>To not die in the airfields of the War of Resistance against Japan or suppressing bandits, but to die during routine transport flights, is somewhat regrettable for a warrior. But even more regrettable are the warrior's elderly father, mother, and young daughter. Peifeng's father is Mr. Zhu Zhishan, currently the Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications. His mother was Chairman Chiang's younger sister, who died early. He was an only son, with no siblings, and was raised by Chairman Chiang from a young age. The Chairman had a special fondness for him. In order to save the nation from danger, he did not choose a safe job, but instead threw himself into the battlefield. It was not until December 25, 1945, that he married Miss Yang Yuwen in Chongqing. Miss Yang is the third daughter of Chairman Yang Sen of Guizhou. The couple had a very loving relationship after their marriage and had a daughter, who is now less than a year old. After Peifeng's accident, the elderly parents and the widow were overwhelmed with grief. The remains have now been sent back to Zhu's ancestral home in Fenghua County by Miss Yang. The family still lives in Shanghai. The absence of a central figure in this family makes their desolate situation imaginable.</p>
<p>When Chiang Wei-kuo described Zhu Peifeng's personality to the reporter, he especially pointed out that Zhu usually enjoyed sitting quietly and thinking deeply, and had profound insights into all issues. When he was active, he was intensely active. He was good at both basketball and tennis. At Cambridge University, he was a member of the school's tennis team! Zhu was extremely sincere to his friends and extremely responsible in his duties, never uttering a word of complaint. Chiang Wei-kuo said, "The death of my cousin Peifeng is a great shock to me, but also a great encouragement. My brothers and I are all working in the military. He was in the Air Force, and I am in the Army. Now he has unfortunately died! I think only by doubling my efforts can I make up for the loss of his death!"</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Face the Problem of Factory Raw Materials!</h3>
<p>Most of the second-category goods listed in the Provisional Measures for the Amendment of Import and Export Trade are industrial raw materials. Since the first quota was announced on February 18 of last year, five rounds have been conducted up to February 20 of this year (the fifth and sixth quarters were announced together). The figures are as follows:</p>
<p>First Quarter $99,675,000 USD</p>
<p>Second Quarter $72,610,000 USD</p>
<p>Third Quarter $67,873,000 USD</p>
<p>Fourth Quarter $53,393,000 USD</p>
<p>Fifth and Sixth Quarters $73,476,000 USD</p>
<p>The average figure for the fifth and sixth quarters is $36,738,000 USD. It can be seen that the quota is gradually decreasing each quarter. The recent two quarters are less than 37% of the first quarter. Although the authorities claimed at the time of the first announcement that the quotas for second-category goods were mostly determined based on the average import value of the three years before the war, the domestic production situation and the possibility of domestic substitutes were also considered. However, as the quotas decrease each quarter, and foreign prices increase with time, and as the communist bandits disrupt more and more areas, hindering the source of domestic substitutes such as cotton, wool, and wheat, a general shortage of industrial raw materials is inevitable. When the second quota was announced, the Transportation Control Committee already frankly admitted that the quota was known to be insufficient compared to the needs of production. Now the permitted import quota has been reduced by half compared to that time, making the situation of being stretched and barely able to cope even more imaginable. Therefore, the match, woolen textile, and rubber industries have successively requested an increase in the quota, and the textile industry is particularly concerned about the limited cotton reserves. As for general manufacturers, with limited resources, disputes have arisen over the allocation of resources between industrial associations and import associations, between old members and new members, and between region A and regions B and C. Labor disputes involving reduced wages and layoffs have emerged endlessly over the past year, with the lack of raw materials being a major reason. On the other hand, scarcity has made goods expensive, leading to hoarding and speculation, resulting in an increasingly rampant black market. After factories are allocated raw materials, they often sell them privately for profit, as the profit from manufacturing is less and easier than reselling the raw materials, reducing the incentive to produce. In addition to fictitious companies, there is now a new type of fictitious factory that specializes in competing for allocations and reselling for profit. Legitimate manufacturers engaged in production are forced to seek raw materials on the black market or through smuggling to barely maintain their production. As a result, the black market is thriving, and smuggling is becoming more prevalent.</p>
<p>If these phenomena were merely disturbances and chaos, it might be possible to endure them for a while, waiting for the situation to improve. As the Labor Control Committee said, only when the trade situation gradually improves can the needs of all parties be reasonably adjusted. Unfortunately, raw materials are indeed insufficient, and production will be interrupted. This is not just an industrial problem, but an overall economic problem, and not just an economic problem, but it will affect the entire social and security problem. According to official statistics, from the victory in August 1945 to the end of last year, the municipal labor-management dispute cases totaled 3,877, of which 1,652 were related to employment or dismissal, accounting for approximately 43%. In the past year (1947), the number of such dispute cases exceeded the total of the previous sixteen months. This proves that the number of layoffs by businesses is increasing with time, and the unemployment situation is indeed becoming more serious.</p>
<p>How should this problem be solved? The most ideal solution, of course, would be to open up foreign exchange and allow foreign raw materials to be imported freely, which would provide a continuous supply. However, this is impossible in reality and not permitted by the current trade policy. Secondly, it is to dredge local products and transport them from production areas to industrial areas to supplement some of the needs. This is something everyone should work together on, but it also depends on the domestic military and transportation situation. Therefore, we believe that the only thing we can focus on at present is to strive to absorb remittances from overseas Chinese and promote exports. This is the only way to obtain foreign exchange funds and the only way to exchange for raw materials to maintain production. The key is whether the import-export chain system can be implemented and whether goods with self-provided foreign exchange can be allowed to be imported. If these two things are allowed, then the above problem can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Although opinions differ on how much overseas deposits Chinese people have abroad, since methods such as borrowing have been repeatedly announced by the government and have diplomatic difficulties, apart from guiding them to freely flow into the country through methods such as running businesses and investing, there is no other way to attract them. Outside of the current foreign exchange management methods, if overseas remittances are required to flow entirely into the country without spilling over elsewhere, then apart from guiding them to freely flow into the country through methods such as running businesses and investing, there is no other way to attract them. We really don't understand what policy the government is adopting. On one hand, it is stingy with funds and claims to welcome foreign investment, while on the other hand, it is deeply closed and refuses to allow Chinese people's own foreign exchange to return to the country? What reasons do these officials hold? If it is said that unrestricted foreign goods would be like dumping and would endanger national industries, then the import and export management measures are in place, and it should not be difficult to strictly limit the types of goods. If it is because smuggling is difficult to prevent, then smuggling is rampant now, and the state has not therefore completely cut off legitimate import and export. We guess that their biggest reason is nothing more than preventing the black market for foreign exchange and avoiding stimulating prices. In fact, the black market for foreign exchange has never disappeared during the war and after the war, and there are many factors that stimulate prices, so it will not stabilize because of this. Conversely, the influx of necessary foreign goods and the abundance of materials may temporarily achieve the effect of moderating prices. This can be supported by the fact that prices were relatively stable during the time of President Song.</p>
<p>The above reasons can also be applied to the import-export linkage system. Because the reason why this system has been delayed is said to be due to these concerns. Otherwise, the exchange of import and export should be allowed, not just barter, which does not conflict with the government's current trade policy. Moreover, the disadvantages of export trade are borne by the importers themselves, which can be used to promote exports. Foreign raw materials come in continuously without consuming foreign exchange, which is also beneficial for the government. If imports are excessive or violate prohibitions, they can be restricted according to law. These measures are what is called killing several birds with one stone, so why is the government not happy to do it?</p>
<p>Some say that after importers collect local goods for export, the government will have no foreign exchange to obtain, which must be seriously considered. We don't know if after the import and export linkage, the purchase of local goods will be allowed to importers as a monopoly. Since merchants can purchase and transport exports, why can't the government divide the channels and advance together? Moreover, in addition to this fund, the government has its own sources of foreign exchange, such as loans, barter, and various loans. On the export side, although a sum of funds is divided, on the import side, a burden is equally saved. The result is an increase in exports, an inflow of foreign capital (including overseas remittances and overseas deposits), development of production, and increased tax revenue, with no actual loss.</p>
<p>In short, whether raw materials can be supplied is not just a matter of the interests of a few manufacturers, but it is related to the nation's lifeline. Therefore, whether import and export should be allowed to be linked, whether self-provided foreign exchange should be allowed for import, and how to promote export goods and absorb overseas remittances are all technical issues. Although we have no preconceptions, to maintain the national economy, we must maintain the national industry, and to maintain the national industry, we must maintain sufficient raw materials. This is a very obvious principle. The current state of raw material panic and anxiety, as well as the atmosphere of capital flight and factory relocation, should not be ignored by anyone concerned about the national economy and the people's livelihood, especially the responsible authorities. Moreover, according to the fifth and sixth quota lists, a certain number of cars are still allowed to be imported, but no foreign exchange is given. This clearly leaves a way for self-provided foreign exchange to be used for importing goods. Why is this way only allowed to be applied to car imports and not allowed for factories to follow suit? Is it because most car dealers are foreign merchants, so a convenient door is opened for them? This is especially difficult to understand!</p>

<h3>Fundraising for Children's Relief Fund; Draft Agreement Prepared</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] White Les, Deputy Representative of the Far East Fundraising for the United Nations Children's Relief Fund, is currently negotiating with the Chinese government to sign an agreement on fundraising for the Children's Relief Fund. The draft agreement has now been prepared and will be submitted to the first regular meeting of the Chinese Committee on the 2nd for preliminary discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] The United Nations Headquarters recently received a telegram from Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, guaranteeing full support for the United Nations' global appeal for people to donate one day's income to relieve refugee children around the world. Similar telegrams have arrived in the capitals of various countries. At the same time, the Planning Committee of the United Nations Children's Emergency Relief Fund held a meeting today to discuss the report of its representative to China. The report recommended that the emergency aid to China approved by the Committee at its last meeting should be shipped immediately. Of the US$3.5 million temporarily allocated for relief in China, US$1 million is for immediate relief.</p>
<h3>Talks with Petition Delegation from the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) "Our delegation, entrusted by all the people of the Northeast and authorized by the Northeast Bureau, represents the Northeast to petition in the capital. Bi Yiyu, Speaker of the Jilin Provincial Assembly, and Lin Lanshan, Speaker of the Liaobei Provincial Assembly, originally agreed to come together, but due to transportation obstacles between Changchun and Siping, they traveled slowly. Subsequently, the Jilin Provincial Fellow Townsmen Association in Shenyang recommended Mr. Tian Yushi to represent the people of Jilin and Changchun to go to Beijing together to petition. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the 27th of last month, but it was delayed due to aircraft problems and only arrived in Shanghai recently. Regarding the seriousness of the situation in the Northeast and the way to save it, fellow countrymen and elders from the Northeast in Beijing and Shanghai have made clear representations to all parties. If a large army can be immediately reinforced, it can be saved. If it is delayed any longer, it will inevitably be lost, and it will be difficult to recover for a hundred years, not only endangering North China but also shaking the foundation of the country, and world peace will also suffer a more serious threat. Just as our delegation was leaving Shenyang on its way south, we learned that the war situation in the Northeast was deteriorating and that the Central Government was about to send reinforcements, but the timing was urgent, and we must race against time and see the facts to be effective. Our delegation will take the night train tonight to go to Beijing to meet with the Chairman and relevant authorities and discuss everything with all parties. Shanghai is the center of public opinion in our country. We hope that fellow countrymen and the press will provide more assistance to awaken the people's attention to the situation in the Northeast, so as to unite our efforts and overcome difficulties together. This is what we hope for."</p>
<h3>Vice Chairman Sun's Remarks in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Regarding the Distortion of Reports by American Reporters, It is Considered Necessary to Refute Solemnly</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 1st] Vice Chairman Sun met with reporters at the Provincial Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM today. According to his remarks, in the past, a few American journalists came to Taiwan and did not interview the government and the council, but only obtained information from one or two people who hated the government, making distorted reports, saying that Taiwanese people hoped to break away from China and be placed under trusteeship. This kind of instigation and discord is a propaganda that does not conform to the facts and is purely an international communist conspiracy, which should be solemnly refuted. He went on to say that the technical personnel of our country taking over the industries in Taiwan are not only competent, but also have new improvements and contributions in technology. According to his estimate, it takes about US$100 million to revive Taiwan. If detailed methods are prepared, this fund can be borrowed from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Regarding the National Assembly meeting, he believes that it will not be postponed. Finally, regarding Sino-Soviet relations, he said that there should be no problems with Sino-Soviet relations, because China has always abided by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, but in the past, the dismantling and relocation of factories in the Northeast, the refusal to allow our army to land in Dalian, and the transfer of weapons captured from the Kwantung Army to the communist bandits are all obvious to everyone, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3>10th Anniversary of the Central Training Corps</h3>
<p>Students in Beijing Hold a Celebration</p>
<p>Commander Chiang Attends to Give Instructions</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The 1st was the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Central Training Corps. All the students in Beijing went to the Central Training Corps in Xiaolingwei in the morning to attend the celebration meeting. More than 1,400 students attended. Commander Chiang attended to give instructions, with many exhortations, saying that the corps has been established for ten years, and many graduates have been able to work hard to serve the country and complete the victory of the War of Resistance, which is a great achievement in the history of the revolution.

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs: Taiwan itself does not produce aluminum ore.

After China took over these factories, they were operated by the National Resources Commission. One of the factories was heavily bombed during the war. It was decided to first operate the Kaohsiung factory, which is now the Taiwan Aluminum Corporation. Its original equipment can produce approximately 30,000 tons of aluminum oxide and over 10,000 tons of aluminum ingots annually.

<h3>Vandenberg Attends Senate Debate Defends Aid to Europe Amount Not to be Reduced Aid to China and Greece-Turkey Cases Soon to be Submitted for Review US House Foreign Affairs Committee Demands Leadership of the World in Resisting Communism</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York Radio Dispatch, 1st: Washington News, Senate Chairman Vandenberg today strongly urged the Senate to pass the European Recovery Program, believing that this effort is sufficient to prevent the outbreak of a third world war and become a turning point in the history of the next century. This legislation aims to seek peace and stability for the free people of the free world. He argued that the cost of the first year of the aid to Europe plan is 5.3 billion US dollars and should not be reduced, because reducing it will reduce the possibility of its success. All things should be thoroughly sought, and we should not hesitate. The Soviet Union's obstruction makes the future of the aid to Europe plan somewhat obstructed, but the United States must do its best to rescue the world from danger. Vandenberg also stated that the United States also has a responsibility to provide assistance to Latin America, China, and Greece and Turkey, which must be discussed in this session of Congress.</p>
<p>[Reuters London Dispatch, 1st] Well-informed sources in the United States stated: The United States can approve the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe by the end of this month. The Senate and House of Representatives will finally pass the bill within four weeks, but if the plan is passed on March 31, the shipment of materials from the United States to Europe will be several months later. At the same time, authoritative sources here expect that the review of British economic policy in early March will change its basis due to the imminent implementation of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 29th, United Press] The US House Foreign Affairs Committee recently requested that the United States lead the defense of the "non-communist world" to prevent it from being under the Soviet and European Communist control; otherwise, the United States will face a "violent revolution" throughout the world. The committee issued a lengthy report entitled "The World Strategy and Tactics of Communism." The report believes that the conclusions of Soviet policy are as follows: (1) The Communist Party has one goal, which is world revolution; (2) They believe that this revolution will be a violent revolution; (3) They do not admit that peace can be maintained in the future; they expect another world war. The report stated that when the Communist Party seizes the "extreme democratic group," they use despicable means to use this group to achieve their goals and infiltrate workers' organizations. The chairman of the committee is Bolton, a Republican from Ohio. This report was released on the 100th anniversary of the "Republican Manifesto." The report believes that to prevent global communism, we should do our best to establish economically consolidated groups, led by the United States, including Western Europe, China, the Near East, and the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Asks People to Increase Vigilance Firmly Guard the Last Bastion of Europe Financial Measures Fail to Achieve Results Crisis Lurks</h3>
<p>[Reuters Lyon, 29th] Prime Minister Schumann recently delivered a speech to the National Committee of the People's Republic, stating that France has fallen behind in military technology and time cannot be lost. He said that France is the last bastion of civilization, and it is not enough to issue a decree to deploy an iron curtain to protect France's safety. There is currently unrest everywhere, and anything can happen at any time. Neither domestic nor foreign affairs can be sure to avoid any development.</p>
<p>We must not be too pessimistic, nor should we speculate arbitrarily. We should pay attention to developments outside the national borders, but we should not judge European affairs solely on the basis of the Soviet Union. We in France should restore the welfare of the country. If we can establish social peace and justice, it will be the most effective opposition to communism. The National Committee of the People's Republic also passed a resolution condemning the coup in Prague, denouncing it as an opposition to democracy and the establishment of a dictatorship by a minority. The National Committee also passed another resolution, supporting Schumann's efforts to revive the French economy and curb rising prices.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 1st] Many observers here predict that if the government cannot stabilize prices within fifteen days, the Communist Party will again trigger a strike wave. So far, the financial austerity plan implemented by the Schumann cabinet has failed to curb the rising prices. American and French people alike believe that France's US dollar reserves are being depleted at an increasing rate, and the Marshall Plan will not be implemented until after April 1. I am afraid that distant water cannot put out the nearby fire and cannot save the crisis that will be caused by workers demanding increased wages. This crisis seems to be gradually forming since the beginning of March.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Criticizes the Communist Party National Radio Staff Strike</h3>
<p>[United Press Rome, 29th] President Sperli recently told 20,000 Catholic party members that communism must be defeated in the April election; otherwise, we will not be able to vote in Italy again. These words of Jia are the strongest attacks on the Communist Party in the election campaign. A few hours later, all Italian radio stations were silent because 3,000 technicians had followed the strike order of the Communist Party-controlled union. They demanded fourteen months' salary per year. Jia criticized the Italian Communist Party, saying that it established action teams, just like those who supported the Czech coup. It is said that the Czech incident proves our crisis, but we believe that the incident does not happen in one area but everywhere. He criticized Communist leader Togliatti because Tao protested against Jia's speech, calling it a challenge. He replied that the Czech Republic is an example of what he criticized. Defense Minister Fatkiniti also warned the armed forces that political propaganda is not allowed in the military during the election period.</p>

It is said that although the Soviet proposal may not be found to have the major changes that some countries with close agreements with the Soviet Union currently have, the government's reorganization can be imagined as a result of the evolution of the situation.</p>
<h3>Anti-Soviet Leaflets Discovered Rumors Abound in Helsinki</h3>
<p>[Reuters Helsinki, 29th] Anti-Soviet and Stalin leaflets were discovered here today. The police are investigating their source. The leaflets stated, "Our country now has only nominal independence. Moscow decides the country's affairs. This situation must be ended quickly. Stalin has never forgotten his wartime promise that the Finns on the ground must be eliminated, and he has begun to implement these promises." There are many rumors here. One said that the Soviet flag has been hung outside the Finnish Congress, but it is actually one of the national flags of various countries hung here for the World Skating Championships. It is also rumored that the Soviet Ambassador to Finland, Lavrentiev, has requested the Finnish authorities to provide a complete list of active Finnish army officers. Officials have not been able to confirm this statement, and a press release may be issued.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Advocate Taking Action to Prevent the Soviet Union from Expanding Its Influence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London Radio Dispatch, 1st: Newspapers here today almost unanimously advocated taking action to prevent the expansion of the Soviet Union. Editorials from the right-wing and left-wing moderates are quite similar. The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" stated, "The United States should make it clear to the Soviet Union that if the Soviet Union takes another step forward in Europe, the atomic bomb will soon land in the Soviet Union." The Labor Party's official newspaper, "Daily Herald," published an editorial entitled "Peace or War," stating, "The Soviet Union's policy is bad and should not be ignored. However, Western European democracies should not be satisfied with anticipating a conflict that is about to come, but should still strive to get the Soviet Union to participate in global cooperation, as stipulated in the United Nations Charter." The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" urged to speed up the promotion of the European Recovery Plan and sign economic and military agreements with the United States.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, 1st] Moscow Radio said that Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Presidium of the North Korean People's Assembly, denied the claim that an independent country had been established in North Korea.

According to a Gallup poll, the percentage of American voters who believe that the United States will be drawn into another major war within ten years remains the same as in August of last year. In August of last year, 53% of voters surveyed believed that the United States would be drawn into another major war within ten years, while this time, 54% held the same view. The Gallup poll shows that Americans do not believe the Soviet Union's accusations that the United States is instigating war, nor the similar claims made by Wallace, are justified. The survey also shows that the vast majority of those who believe war is inevitable believe that the Soviet Union, not the United States, will be responsible for starting another major war.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ting-fu Addresses Asia at the United Nations</h3>
<p>Strengthening the United Nations' Power</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 1st: Lake Success dispatch. Since March, Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu has been serving as the president of the Security Council on a rotating basis. Tonight, Mr. Chiang delivered a radio address to Asia from the United Nations radio station on the subject of the United Nations, stating that our era is an era of democratic politics, and all people must adopt a realistic view of the future of the United Nations. We should not be pessimistic or overly optimistic about the future of the United Nations; for the peace and security of mankind, we must work to strengthen the power of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>British Parliament Debates Defense Issues; Conservatives Oppose Troop Reductions</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Parliament is scheduled to discuss defense issues tomorrow due to the Conservative Party's strong criticism of the Labour government's continued policy of troop reductions. Conservative Deputy Leader Eden will introduce an amendment stating that "the United Kingdom's defense lacks a system of adjustments that is comprehensive and suitable for the times, which is cause for serious concern." A heated debate is anticipated. The government's defense plan stipulates that the total number of national armed forces should be reduced to 716,000 by March 1949. The current troop strength is 940,000, compared to 1,427,000 a year ago. In addition, this year's military expenditure will be reduced from £899 million to £692 million.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminal Suzuki Deceived Hu Lin</h3>
<p>Claimed to Sympathize with China While Advocating Aggression</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Today, during the trial of war criminals, the prosecution of the Far East International Military Tribunal attacked the credibility and evidentiary value of the testimony of Hu Lin, general manager and publisher of the Ta Kung Pao. The prosecution claimed that Mr. Hu had been deceived by the accused Teiichi Suzuki, and therefore Mr. Hu's testimony was worthless. Hu Lin was the first Chinese representative to testify in defense of the accused Japanese war criminal. He testified by means of a written document, which was submitted as evidence by the defendant's lawyers last December. Hu defended Suzuki, calling him a "friend of China" and expressing great sympathy for the Kuomintang and the Chinese government under the leadership of President Chiang. Hu stated that as early as 1929, Suzuki had advocated that Japan should encourage cooperation between Chairman Chiang and Marshal Zhang Xueliang to unite China, and that Suzuki's attitude toward Sino-Japanese cooperation remained unchanged even when Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated to a serious degree in the final years. Canadian prosecutor Nolan told the military tribunal during the presentation of his individual indictment against Suzuki that Suzuki "deceived" Hu, keeping him unaware of the Japanese army's true policies. The clearly stated goal of the Japanese army was to ultimately dismantle the Kuomintang and completely control China, and Suzuki's so-called sympathy for the Kuomintang and the Chinese government under the leadership of President Chiang was a "ruse."</p>

<h3>Czechoslovak Cabinet Convenes Meeting; Discusses Strengthening Domestic Security; Guarantees Implementation of Agricultural Reform Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 1st] The new Czechoslovak cabinet will convene its first meeting tomorrow. The agenda will include studying proposals from the trade union movement and the Communist Farmers' Congress, and a plan to strengthen domestic security.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gottwald addressed a gathering of 100,000 farmers today, declaring that landholdings of more than 50 hectares would immediately be distributed as property to those who till them. However, he stated that Czechoslovakia would not implement the Soviet system of collective farms.</p>
<p>Gottwald's address was met with cheers from the crowd. Defense Minister Svoboda, who is not affiliated with any party, followed Gottwald and expressed Czechoslovakia's continued loyalty to the Soviet Union and other allies. After his address, he asked the crowd to cheer for President Beneš, which was met with thunderous applause. Agriculture Minister Ďuriš stated that there are currently 6,000 tractors in the country, and after the completion of the two-year plan, this number will increase to 12,000, and after the completion of the five-year plan, it will increase to 35,000. He also said that after the implementation of tax reform, 70% of farmers will be exempt from taxes. The assembly concluded with the singing of the national anthem by the entire crowd.</p>
<p>Masaryk's Remarks</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 29th] Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk, who is not affiliated with any party, met with a French journalist today and gave his first public statement since the political crisis. He said that the Czech nation is fundamentally a democratic nation and will continue to maintain these characteristics. The political crisis was caused by those who held mistaken ideas that they could govern the country without cooperating with or even opposing the Communist Party. The crisis has now been resolved in a democratic and constitutional manner. When asked about his personal role in the crisis, Masaryk stated that he had always acted in concert with the people and would continue to maintain this attitude in the future. He joined the government based on democratic ideals and will continue to serve the new democracy to the best of his ability and as needed. Regarding the German question, Masaryk stated that Czechoslovakia, as a neighbor of Germany, has a deep understanding of the German question. The new government and the entire nation are united in recognizing the dangers of the German question. However, Czechoslovakia is a peace-loving nation and will never allow Europe to be divided into two opposing blocs.</p>
<h3>Motives for the Czechoslovak Coup</h3>
<p>Internal Factors Were a More Significant Component</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 29th] Many Western diplomats believe that the Czech crisis was due more to internal factors than to the Soviet Union's eagerness to consolidate its alliance system and acquire territory for future expansion into the West. This view has been clarified by the statements of Czech politicians in recent days and by the declaration of the All-Slavic Committee last week. Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Clementis told a reporter from the French Communist Party newspaper L'Humanité that the first goal of the new Czech foreign policy is to complete its alliance system, especially to conclude a treaty with Poland. The resolution passed at the final meeting of the All-Slavic Committee yesterday also mentioned the need for Slavic countries to conclude firm treaties with Romania and Hungary.</p>

<p>Taft Says Republicans Will Win</p>
<p>Democrats Will Not Support Truman</p>
<p>[United Press, Cleveland, 29th] Senator Taft predicted on the 29th that the Republican Party would easily win the November election because the Democratic Party has been split by a third party, because Southern Democrats have already shown their disloyalty. He also said that Wallace's third party will absorb the votes of the communist left wing, while the Southern states' opposition to President Truman's actions will weaken the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] A Southern Democratic senator bluntly predicted on the 29th that the Democratic National Convention to be held in Philadelphia in July would not nominate Truman as the presidential candidate.

<h3>Hull's Memoirs (37)</h3>

<p>Severity Is Not Necessarily a Good Method</p>
<p>In September 1944, when the President decided to meet with Prime Minister Churchill to hold the Second Quebec Conference, he asked me if I would be willing to accompany him. At that time, I was in poor health, and the Dumbarton Oaks Conference was also underway, so I replied that I would like to stay in Washington, but if he needed me, I would be able to break away and go.</p>
<p>Shortly before the conference was to be held, the President was forced to allow Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau to accompany him. Morgenthau and his friends had been drafting a harsh plan for dealing with post-war Germany for some time, and the leaders of those groups concerned about German atrocities demanded that the President allow Morgenthau to go to Quebec to present his plan for dealing with Germany.</p>
<p>The President himself had the view that the German people as a whole should be given a lesson they would never forget. On August 26, 1944, he sent a long memorandum to Secretary of War Stimson, and sent me a copy, in which he objected to the content of the manual prepared by the War Department for guiding the military government officials occupying Germany.</p>
<p>He said, "This book gives the impression that we are going to completely restore Germany, just like the Netherlands and Belgium, and return the German people to their pre-war condition as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"The most important point is that every German must recognize that Germany has been defeated this time. I do not want them to starve to death, but, for example, if they need more food to keep body and soul together, then we should use the army kitchens to make soup and feed them three times a day. This can keep them completely healthy, and they will remember this experience for the rest of their lives. Whether as a whole or individually, they must clearly recognize the fact that they are a defeated nation so that they will not dare to launch a new war in the future."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of disposing of the German navy, the President put forward a new idea.</p>
<p>On October 13, he wrote me a memorandum in which he said that he agreed with the Joint Chiefs of Staff's opinion on completely destroying the German navy, but he had a point to add:</p>
<p>He said, "In the past, the so-called destruction meant dragging the ships into the sea and sinking them. I think that sometimes surrendered ships are turned into scrap metal as destruction. I do not agree with sinking tens of millions of tons of steel into the sea as a complete destruction.</p>
<p>"Recently, a new use has been found for these ships. We have used sunken ships as breakwaters to build new ports, both in Italy and on the coast of Normandy. This is a cheaper way to build breakwaters. I think that the United Nations organization should pass the request of that country to use these ships for definite purposes, sinking them on the beach as breakwaters to improve or newly build berthing facilities. Using them for this peaceful purpose is a good idea.</p>
<p>"In this case, the ships should be sunk at the designated location as quickly as possible, and monitored on-site by a subcommittee of the United Nations organization. Once the ships are sunk, it will never be possible to retrieve them and reuse them for war purposes."</p>
<p>On September 1, 1944, Rypins told me that the President wanted to organize a "Cabinet Committee on the German Problem."</p>
<p>The "Cabinet Committee" held its first meeting in my office on September 5, with Hopkins, Morgenthau, and Stimson also in attendance. I presented a memorandum that I and my staff had prepared in advance, dated September 4, which included some preliminary recommendations that the Cabinet Committee might submit to the President.</p>
<p>Secretary Stimson almost completely agreed with this memorandum, except for one point, which was that the German people's standard of living should be lowered to the subsistence level. Secretary Morgenthau also seemed to agree with most of the memorandum, but was unwilling to state it explicitly. Hopkins gave me a short message on September 5, in which he said that he also agreed, except for a few minor reservations on the wording that would not affect the content of the memorandum.</p>
<p>The next day, these people met with the President at the White House. I presented the memorandum of September 4 to the President and said that the other members of the committee had not yet fully agreed, but it could serve as a basis for discussion. Stimson presented a memorandum from the War Department, which was very similar to ours in general. However, Morgenthau presented the harsh original memorandum from the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>The discussion ended without a result. The opinions of the State Department and the War Department were so different from those of the Treasury Department that no further discussions were held.</p>
<p>This was our situation when the Quebec Conference was held on September 11. We had not been able to reach any coordination in terms of opinions. As I said above, Morgenthau induced the President to let him participate in the conference, where he was prepared to present his own extreme plan to the President and the Prime Minister. I asked Ambassador to Canada Atherton to represent us.</p>
<p>Four days after the start of the conference, I received a memorandum from the President dated September 15, which shocked me greatly. This memorandum showed that he and Churchill had largely accepted Morgenthau's opinion. The memorandum said that the President and the Prime Minister felt that the best way to prevent Germany from rearming, one of the key points, was the future disposition of the Ruhr and Saar regions. Germany's rapid and easy conversion of metallurgical, chemical, and electrical industries from peacetime to wartime had given us a very painful lesson. At the same time, we should also remember that Germany had destroyed a large part of the industrial facilities of the Soviet Union and other allied countries, so it was fair that those damaged countries should have the right to remove the machinery they needed to compensate for the losses they had suffered.</p>
<p>The memorandum continued:</p>
<p>"Therefore, the various industries in the Ruhr and Saar regions must be shut down. We feel that these two regions should be entrusted to a country under the world organization, which would supervise the dismantling of these industries, ensuring that they do not reorganize under some disguise."</p>
<p>"The goal of this method of removing war-manufacturing industries from the Ruhr and Saar regions is to transform Germany into a country that is primarily agricultural and pastoral in nature."</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister and the President have expressed their agreement to this method."</p>
<p>In the letter attached to the memorandum, the President said that he was quite satisfied with this. He believed that I would also be able to agree with the general idea of not allowing the Ruhr and Saar regions to revive.</p>
<p>However, I felt that I could not agree with any plan whose "goal was to transform Germany into a country that is primarily agricultural and pastoral in nature." Seven million Germans could not possibly survive on that little bit of German land alone. They would starve to death as a result, and would become a burden on other countries. This strategy would cause Germans to have endless hatred. This would be to punish the entire people and their descendants for the crimes of a few. This would not only punish Germany, but also punish most of Europe.</p>
<p>The President also confirmed in the letter that he thought he had finalized the locations where the troops occupying Germany would be stationed. He had hoped to use northwestern Germany as the American occupation zone, but later agreed with Churchill to have the British occupy it, while the United States would occupy most of the southern regions, including Bavaria.</p>
<p>On September 15, the same day that the President sent me a memorandum including the Morgenthau Plan and the decision on occupation zones, he sent me another memorandum in which he told me that Morgenthau had also presented a plan in Quebec, along with his plan for dealing with Germany, for a $6.5 billion loan to Britain. This seemed like a quid pro quo; the Secretary of the Treasury used this to make Churchill agree with his Draconian method of dealing with Germany.</p>
<p>The President said in the memorandum that he had agreed that Britain could continue to receive $3.5 billion worth of military aid and $3 billion worth of non-military aid from our country while Germany was defeated and the war against Japan was still in progress. He agreed with Churchill's statement that if the United Kingdom was to clear its war debts, then its export trade, which had already been reduced to a minimum, had to be re-established. Of course, materials obtained from the Lend-Lease Act and other similar loans must not be exported or sold for profit, but it was essential that the United States should not attach any conditions to the materials supplied to Britain under the Lend-Lease Act, because otherwise its export trade would be unable to recover.</p>
<p>This struck me like a blow to the waist. This would destroy the negotiations we had been conducting with Britain for three years. This violated Article VII of the Lend-Lease Agreement we signed with Britain in 1942, which stipulated that Britain should adopt a non-discriminatory commercial policy after the war, meaning that it would abolish imperial tariff preferences.</p>
<p>I believe that this entire development in Quebec angered me more than anything else during my entire time as Secretary of State. If this Morgenthau Plan had been leaked, and leaks were inevitable—and it was leaked later—the result would have been that Germany would have fought desperately, causing the United States to lose thousands and tens of thousands more lives.</p>

<h3>Full Rationing Price Decided: $240,000 Per Peck; Mayor Wu and Others Jointly Host Press Conference, Reporting That Proceeds from Rice Sales Will Be Used for Social Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The system of quantitative rice rationing based on household registration certificates in this city was officially implemented yesterday. The ration is one peck of rice per person per month, and the price is set at $240,000 per peck. Ration certificates were issued yesterday. To ensure that citizens fully understand the system, Mayor Wu, the chairman of the Municipal Food Distribution Committee, Pan Guanghui, the representative of the US Aid to China Materials Processing Committee of the Executive Yuan, and Mr. Kirkpatrick and Mr. Payne of the US Aid to China Materials Committee, jointly hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at the city government at 5:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu first explained that the purpose of rice rationing was to stabilize rice prices. In the past, it was not possible to implement this due to concerns about the source of rice. This time, thanks to US aid, we would like to express our gratitude. Then, the Chairman of the Committee reported the detailed arrangements for the rationing, stating that the principle of the full rationing was to be as simple as possible. All citizens, regardless of age, are entitled to one peck of rice per month. To avoid crowding when purchasing rice, the rice ration certificates are divided into two types: one for use in the first half of the month, and one for use in the second half of the month. Rice stores are not designated, and citizens can choose any rice store in their district to purchase rice with their certificates. All rice stores and rice companies in this city are participating in the program, mobilizing more than 2,000 rice stores, more than 200 rice companies, 130 brokers, and more than 300 middlemen. They are all given a profit of 5%. In the future, when citizens go to buy rice, they can compare rice samples and ask for delivery without paying for delivery. Rice ration certificates in this city have been distributed to the district offices starting yesterday, and they are instructed to distribute them to each household within three days. Citizens can then purchase rice with their certificates.</p>
<h3>Factors Determining the Rationing Price: Report by the Mayor</h3>
<p>Regarding the determination of the rice rationing price, Mayor Wu reported the following two points: (1) It is calculated based on 95% of the actual price in the free market. (2) The rice price for the next month is determined during the last five days of each month. This month's price is based on yesterday's prices in the free market. Yesterday's market price for top-quality white rice was $2.8 million, plus a 6% profit, which should be $2.968 million. Because US relief rice is 150 catties per dan, while domestic rice is 165 catties per dan, it is discounted by 96%, totaling $2.8419 million. Because the quality of the rationed rice is lower, it is further discounted by 90%, totaling $2.557 million. After another discount of 95%, it is $2.4025 million. For ease of calculation, the price of the rationed rice is determined to be $2.4 million per stone and $240,000 per peck.</p>
<h3>American Representative's Three Points of View</h3>
<p>Mr. Kirkpatrick of the China Relief and Material Committee stated: Shanghai is the third largest city in the world, attracting significant international attention, and he hopes the rice rationing system can be successfully implemented as a pilot program. Speaking from the position of an observer, he offered three points: (1) This rationing plan will operate on a four-month cycle.  The rice supply for these four months must be fully stocked, and preparations for the next period's rice supply should be made early. He has already raised this point with the National Government and it has been accepted. (2) The implementation of the rationing plan will treat the five major cities of the country equally. Shanghai is currently managed by a separate organization—the People's Food Allocation Committee—and with the cooperation of the municipal government, success is strongly believed to be attainable. (3) The United States believes that this is the best possible solution under the current overall economic situation in China, and hopes that it can be implemented throughout the country. Following this, Pan Guangjiong of the Executive Yuan's China Relief and Material Processing Committee explained the reasons for selling American relief rice.  According to the Sino-American agreement, this rice must be sold in the five cities, and the proceeds will be used for relief purposes, specifically allocated to social relief and medical hygiene. Therefore, relief is the goal, and rice rationing is merely a tool.</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, did not attend yesterday, but issued a written statement with the following content: (1) He hopes that all citizens of the city will sincerely cooperate with the government. (2) He hopes that the staff will work diligently and honestly. (3) He hopes that all levels of administrative agencies in the city will assist. (4) He hopes for the support of public opinion.</p>
<h3>Only Success Allowed, Failure Not Permitted</h3>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu gave two conclusions, stating: (1) He thanked the United States for providing a large amount of supplies (half of the rice for comprehensive rationing is supplied by the government, and half is supplied by the United States), enabling the rice rationing to be implemented. (2) He declared that the administrative responsibility for rice rationing rests entirely with the municipal government and is unrelated to the US China Relief Committee. Therefore, rice rationing must succeed and cannot fail. Otherwise, the municipal government will face a major crisis. At the beginning of the implementation of the rationing system, he especially called on responsible public officials, rice shops, and all citizens of the city to work together.</p>
<h3>Student Uprising Case Rescheduled for Public Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to the large volume of documents involved in the Tongji University student uprising case, which requires time for review, the public trial has been rescheduled to 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Wireless Telephone Inauguration Ceremony to be Held on the 4th</h3>

<h3>Important Resolutions of the Assembly of Councillors Abolition of Penalties for Exceeding Electricity Limits The Limit is the Month with the Highest Electricity Consumption in the Last Three Months Those Who Do Not Exceed 40 Degrees Will Still be Standardized at 40 Degrees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon. In addition to continuing the agenda that was unfinished at the fourth meeting, namely questioning the Civil Affairs, Police Affairs, and Social Affairs Bureaus, and the three directors successively answering, another important proposal on saving electricity was discussed. After discussion by the Assembly, it was resolved to abolish the penalty method for exceeding electricity limits, and citizens were asked to conserve electricity voluntarily for a trial period of six months. The detailed resolutions include five points: (1) Starting from March 1st of this year, citizens are asked to conserve electricity voluntarily, and the Public Utilities Bureau is requested to promptly order all power companies to temporarily suspend penalties on bills based on meter readings from March 1st. (2) The limit for electricity consumption will be the month with the highest electricity consumption in December of last year, January of this year, and February of this year. However, if any of these months (December, January, or February) did not exceed 40 degrees, the limit will still be 40 degrees. (3) For those who exceed the electricity consumption limit, a first warning will be given, a first severe warning will be given, and those who exceed the limit by more than 30% for the third time will be subject to a power outage for one week or less. (4) The above measures will be tested until the end of September of this year, and the results will be reviewed. If there are any problems, further discussions and improvements will be made. (5) The above points will be sent to the Municipal Government for urgent implementation.</p>
<p>Request for the Return of Electrical Machinery</p>
<p>In addition, an incidental resolution was passed: The electrical generator of the Shanghai Chinese Chamber of Commerce Electric Company, which was dismantled by the enemy during the occupation and placed at the Shijingshan site in Beiping, is now in the possession of the North China Iron and Steel Company of the Resources Committee. The Council will specially send a telegram to the Executive Yuan requesting that it order the Committee and relevant agencies to expedite the development, in order to alleviate the electricity shortage in the Nanshi area.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Principle of Electricity Conservation</p>
<p>According to the above resolution, it was based on the revised review opinions of the Public Utilities Group Review Committee after detailed discussions. A total of seven proposals related to electricity conservation were submitted to the Assembly. After being merged, the reason for the case was: "In order to reduce the burden on citizens, a trial abolition of the penalty for exceeding electricity limits is proposed, and citizens are requested to consider the difficulties of electricity supply and strive to save energy." Therefore, Speaker Pan repeatedly stated that although the penalty method has been resolved to be abolished, the principle of electricity conservation should still be maintained, and he hopes that citizens will voluntarily conserve electricity. On the one hand, it can also test whether citizens have the ability to restrain themselves automatically.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Casualties in the Jindu Incident Vigorous Suppression of Scalpers</h3>
<p>Director Yu Shuping replied to inquiries: (1) In response to Chen Peide's suggestion that two police officers took away the rickshaw pullers' cushions, he has repeatedly ordered it to be prohibited. He plans to have patrol station police officers manage the issue and set up mobile police stations to manage illegal situations. (2) In response to Zhang Zhihan's question: The bandit leader in Pudong committed crimes in the Nanhui area, so he was escorted to that county. The so-called jailbreak situation has been reported to the Department for record. Armed personnel interfering with citizens without cause has been repeatedly addressed with the Department for suppression, but it has not been completely eliminated. The Ling Elementary School case has been handled by the court. In the Jindu tragedy, two citizens died and one was injured, and the municipal government has been asked to provide compensation. (3) Zhao Junhao reported two things: (1) The Xin Kang Flour Mill on Pingliang Road was occupied last October by representatives of the creditor group, along with Sun Zhongxuan, a judicial section member of the Jianlin Road Police Station, who beat the workers. Lawyer Ji Fang represented the mill in a newspaper appeal to the Council, causing social uproar. Why hasn't the authorities investigated and dealt with police officers abusing their power in this way, and why hasn't the police station made a statement after the mill's advertisement for three days? (2) Scalpers in this city are becoming increasingly rampant, and some are taking an international route, leading Americans to improper places in the wharf area. If they are not suppressed, what kind of "national diplomacy" can this be considered? Director Yu replied: The Xin Kang Flour Mill case on Pingliang Road has been sent to the court. If it is found that judicial section members violated the law, they will be severely dealt with. Scalpers are also being vigorously suppressed, but due to the difficulty of the situation, it is impossible to eradicate them all at once. (4) In response to Zhang Zhongyuan's question: Because second-hand goods dealers purchase stolen goods, fingerprinting is used to investigate past crimes, which is not without reason. New prostitute licenses have been suspended since January. (5) In response to Chen Cunren's question: Beggars occupying small vegetable markets will definitely be suppressed. (6) In response to Shi Wende's question: Suburban police vehicles are lacking due to lack of funds, and he hopes that the Council members can initiate donations. (7) Regarding Tao Baichuan's statement that a police officer on Haining Road falsely accused a 13-year-old elementary school student of stealing wire, causing him to be beaten, he said that he was not aware of this and would definitely investigate and deal with it strictly. (8) In response to Jiang Hao's question: Public gambling must be prohibited. Regarding the alleged disguised prostitution investigation by police officers at the Yangshi Cangzhou Hotel, but staying overnight until the next morning before calling the police to arrest the prostitutes, he doubts that this would happen and will investigate and clarify the matter further.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council will continue to hold its sixth meeting this afternoon to discuss proposals.</p>
<h3>Director Wu's Reply to Inquiries on the Prohibition of Dancing "I Have Done Nothing Wrong" "I am Doing Right By the Dancers"</h3>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, replied to inquiries in the Assembly yesterday, making a detailed explanation of the dance ban issue, and stated that he "has thought it over and over, and has done nothing wrong. It can be said that I am doing right by the citizens and doing right by the dancers." Regarding Zhang Zhongyuan and Zhang Zhihan's question of whether the Central Government could be asked to temporarily postpone the dance ban, and why the Municipal Government did not respect the Council's resolution, he said: I can responsibly answer that if the Central Government approves temporary execution, then this Bureau will definitely comply. Or, if the Central Government does not make any statement before the end of March, then execution will also be temporarily postponed. As for the Council's resolution, I not only submitted official documents to the Central Government, but also went to the capital in person to state my case to the Central Government, even to the point of becoming hoarse, but the Central Government still refused to allow it, and execution was required. Therefore, it was the Central Government that did not accept the Council's resolution, and I felt regretful about this. As for myself, being a government official, it is inconvenient to speak to the Central Government on behalf of the councilors. He hopes that the councilors will elect representatives to speak, which may make one aware of the experience I have had.</p>
<p>Central Government Urges, Cannot Be Delayed Any Longer</p>
<p>Regarding Fan Xipin's criticism of why the lottery time was not according to regulations, the lottery method was unreasonable, why was it not prohibited before the dance industry meeting, why were representatives not seen for petitioning, why did the dance industry representatives say it was at New Xianlin, but then mentioned it at the Bureau of Social Affairs, and on the issue of establishing a special court, Director Wu replied: (1) The lottery time was changed to the morning because the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee meeting was scheduled for the afternoon of that day (i.e., January 31st), and on January 29th, a telegram was received from the Central Government inquiring about the lottery situation, so it was decided that it could not be postponed any longer and had to be held in the morning. (2) There is no need for a legal quorum for the lottery. The Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were asked to send representatives, but both replied that it was inconvenient to participate.</p>
<p>Smuggling Unnoticed, No Prevention</p>
<p>(3) Before the dance industry meeting, Director Yu specially sent a flying fortress to prohibit it. However, the dance industry personnel used a clandestine method, smuggling unnoticed. After indicating to the police that they would disband, they ran to the Social Affairs Bureau. Later, Commander Xuan rebuked the representatives at the Social Affairs Bureau. The meeting started at 3:00 PM, and the Garrison Command only received notification at 2:00 PM. (4) Whether the dance industry representatives actually petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau can be proved by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker who were present at the time. (5) I did not know that the dance industry representatives were meeting at New Xianlin. It was Mr. Fan Xipin himself who told me. (6) Whether a special court should be organized has nothing to do with Wu Kaixian. The chairman's order was given to Mayor Wu, not to me.</p>
<h3>Freezing the Cost of Living Index Testing Has Not Been Effective</h3>
<p>In addition, (1) Regarding Zhang Zhihan's suggestion that the cost of living index has too much impact, whether a special review committee can be organized to study and suggest an appropriate solution to the Central Government. Director Wu said that there are currently two committees for the application and review of the cost of living index. If another committee is to be organized, he can also accept it. The method of freezing the cost of living index was tested last year, but it was not effective because prices still could not be frozen, and the reason why prices could not be frozen was because of inflation. My opinion is that I hope the Assembly will resolve to ask the Central Government to quickly open up industrial loans, or use the method of purchasing manufactured goods to allow factories to barely survive and prevent workers from becoming unemployed. Otherwise, within six months, a major incident will occur in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Arrangement for Refugees to Engage in Production</h3>
<p>(2) Regarding the noble inquiry about the price of rice for workers rising to 80,000 yuan per dou, Wu replied that it was an order from the Central Government, but the rice price in the January cost of living index was compiled according to 81,000 yuan. (3) Regarding the refugee problem inquired about by Mei Jiannong and Shi Guan, he said that he would do his best to ask the Ministry of Social Affairs for several general labor unions to allow refugees to engage in production.</p>
<h3>If the Number of Ballots Does Not Exceed the Number Issued, It Cannot Be Considered Fraudulent</h3>
<p>Regarding the inquiries to the Bureau of Civil Affairs, Director Zhang Xiaosong answered each one as follows: (1) Regarding the problem of the conciliation committees in various districts proposed by Qu Yue, Director Zhang stated that the conciliation committees have no legal authority, so many disputes cannot be completely resolved. (2) Regarding the point inquired by Yao Baozhen and Li Shuzi as to why the self-defense force has not yet been established, it will be handled within a short period of time. (3) Jia Dechao questioned Mayor Wu regarding election fraud. He replied: The mayor did not attend due to official duties. Within my scope, I can answer that I am the executive director of the election office, and my responsibility is to perform my duties. The reason why the number of votes is higher than the number of votes when electing councilors is because the population at that time was 3.4 million, while now it is more than 4.4 million. Also, if the number of votes cast does not exceed the number of ballots issued, it is not considered fraud. Some polling stations in various districts are sparsely populated, while others are crowded. As for the district with more votes cast than ballots issued, it is true. Taking the Zhenru district as an example, there are 23,676 voters, 16,500 ballots were issued, and the district head reported that only 5,033 votes were cast, but the number of votes counted was 11,114. Although there were more votes cast, the number did not exceed the number of ballots issued, so it cannot be considered fraud. As for the election results in that district, the votes cast for [name] were the most, accounting for 7,367 votes, which is a fact. In short, the supervisory committee is thoroughly investigating whether there was any fraud in this election. After the investigation, there will be appropriate measures. (4) Regarding the inquiry by Zong [name] about the accounts of the military conscription consolation fund, it is said that the conscript comfort is handled by each district, and the expenses for subsidizing resettlement costs are reported by fourteen districts, and other districts are still being urged to report. As for fraud, there is indeed a case, and personnel from the Bao Tuan Department have been sent to the law [illegible] in five cases and two have fled (5) Shao Yongsheng's suggestion to respect the powers of the district people's representative assembly, strengthen the Bao Tian organization, and train district Bao personnel will be accepted and improved as appropriate. However, the Baomin meetings and training venues are not yet available, so they cannot be handled quickly. (6) Regarding Zhao Yangxiong's question of whether the district chief can also be a councilor, the Ministry of Interior explained that he cannot hold both positions, and he will be notified to the Assembly after further investigation.</p>
<h3>US Military Iron Barge Causes Accident Zhongfang Tugboat Sinks After Collision</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Zhongfang Construction Company's Fangjian No. 1 tugboat was suddenly hit hard by the US Army's No. 792 iron barge as it left the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf, piercing its waist and sinking immediately. Fortunately, the employees on board were able to jump onto the dock and were unharmed. The Fangjian No. 1 tugboat has a displacement of 40 tons and is 70 feet long. It was formerly the China Merchants Bureau's Feicheng steam launch. The night before, it towed two Zhongfang iron barges to transport yarn to the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf, where it was transferred to the Haiyu to be transported to Hong Kong. After the loading was completed that night, the Haiyu set anchor to leave the port at around 5:00 AM yesterday. The Fangjian No. 1 tugboat was planning to leave the wharf when it was hit by the US ship due to attempting to avoid a civilian ship, causing the accident. It is reported that the US Army has scheduled today to ask the US Navy to send a crane to lift the sunken ship and is willing to be responsible for compensating all losses.</p>

<h3>Ye Qiuyuan, Chief Writer of This Newspaper, Passed Away in the Hospital This Morning The Corpse Was Sent to the International Funeral Home, and the Encoffining is Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Ye Qiuyuan (Jian Gang), the chief writer of this newspaper, unfortunately passed away at the Gongji Hospital at 0:30 this morning due to a sudden heart condition, at the age of 42. Mr. Ye was usually in good health, but after being injured in a car accident last August, although he recovered, his physical strength gradually declined. In the process of treatment at Gongji Hospital, symptoms of heart disease were found, and the doctor ordered him to rest carefully. However, Mr. Ye was committed to service, so after being discharged from the hospital after recovery, he resumed his work as usual. Last winter, he felt unwell and thought that his old stomach illness had recurred. When he went to the hospital for an examination on February 5, he found that his heart disease had worsened. He was discharged from the hospital on the 25th, and returned to Gongji for another consultation on the 27th. Yesterday, Mr. Ye still planned to do his duty in spite of his illness. In the afternoon, he also attended the Catholic Church meeting, but at 5:00 PM, he suddenly suffered from severe stomach pain and asthma. He rushed to Gongji Hospital and found that his condition had worsened. He was given oxygen treatment at 10:00 PM, but it was too late. He passed away at 0:30 this morning. The body has been sent to the International Funeral Home, and the encoffining is scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 4th (Thursday).</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Mr. Ye was from Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He was born in February, five years before the founding of the Republic of China. At the age of seventeen, he traveled across the ocean to study politics at Indiana University in the United States. In 1927, he returned to China and served as an editor for Shen Bao and a professor at Fudan University, at the age of only twenty-one. In 1933, he was hired as the director of the Department of Political Economy at China Public School, when he was only twenty-seven years old. During the Anti-Japanese War, he took refuge in Hong Kong and served as the editor-in-chief of the English-language "Tien Hsia Monthly". When Hong Kong fell, he went to the capital and served as a member of the Legislative Yuan until today. After the publication of this newspaper after the victory, Mr. Ye came to Shanghai with Mr. Chen, the general manager of this newspaper. Half of the daily editorials came from his hand. Mr. Ye was not only a famous reporter and a famous professor, but also a devout religious person. He was a lifelong Catholic and spared no effort in promoting his beliefs in writing. In 1944, he went abroad to inspect the British, American, and Roman church affairs, and wrote the book "Pilgrim's Progress" after returning to China.</p>
<h3>Compensation Machinery Guest Invitation to Visit Mostly Japanese-Made Clothing Some German Products Careful Packaging and Good Quality</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Japanese compensation for private enterprises that the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Counseling Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs received, so far, has a total of 343 boxes of machines, including more than ten kinds of lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, and shapers, all stored in the seventh pier warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong. In order to let people from all walks of life understand the contents of the received machines, the office has specially invited representatives from all walks of life to visit for three consecutive days, starting yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, factory personnel and news reporters, the first group to participate, took the China Merchants Bureau's Guoguang ship to the warehouse for a visit.</p>
<p>Heaps of Japanese Compensation Machinery [Photo by Our Newspaper]</p>
<p>Machine Age Five to Ten Years</p>
<p>A total of 20 boxes were opened yesterday. These machines are carefully packaged, of good quality, and free of rust. Most of them are made in Japan, and some are made in Germany. The age is five to ten years old, and there are also a few that are less than five years old or more than ten years old. The factory representatives who participated in the visit were all engrossed and discussed a lot, but they all thought they were usable.</p>
<p>Converting Legal Tender Calculating Evaluation</p>
<p>Director Gu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs told reporters yesterday about the handling of private enterprise compensation materials, saying that the evaluation committee has been established, but has not yet held a meeting. In the future, the first step will be to decide on several major evaluation principles. The price set by the Allied Headquarters is in US dollars. The evaluation after our country receives them in the future will have its own standards. Although the unit is US dollars, the payment will be calculated in legal tender according to the official exchange rate of the National Bank. Because the machines are not easy to keep after they are unpacked, they will not be unpacked when they are distributed to the factories in the future. If the factory finds that there is a problem with the machine after unpacking, the evaluation meeting will also formulate a unified processing method for this.</p>
<p>Electricity Repayment Price Becomes a Problem</p>
<p>According to the opinions of the factory representatives who visited yesterday, it is believed that this type of machine averages about two tons each, and the value of each machine is about 500 million yuan. The machines are certainly usable, but the problems are: First, electricity, that is, after the factory expands, is there enough electricity in the city to supply it? Second, the problem of repayment, that is, although it is currently stipulated to pay in four installments, will it be possible to pay it off when the term expires? If it cannot be repaid, will the machine be taken back by the government? Therefore, they believe that buying a one at a price also has a "considerable risk."</p>
<h3>Municipal Councilors Re-election Not Accurate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The term of office of the councilors in this city is legally limited to two years and should expire in August of this year, but the central government has clearly ordered that the term of office of the current councilors be extended until the official establishment of the city council. Yesterday, there was a rumor about the re-election of the councilors in this city. According to the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Bureau who spoke to reporters, this is indeed inaccurate.</p>

<h3>China Relief Society: British Woman Alleges Underage Girl in Care is Pregnant and About to Give Birth</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] A British woman, Lin, recently filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, accusing the China Relief Society, located at No. 361 Ying Shi Road in the Catholic Church, stating that her niece, Li Liwenkena, who is now 15 years old, suddenly became pregnant while at the Society. She requested an investigation. The facts of the complaint are as follows: Li Liwenkena lost both her parents when she was only two years old and was placed in the care of the China Relief Society. Last autumn, the director of the Society, Tao Guman, suddenly sent Li to the mental asylum affiliated with Guangci Hospital in Minhang, claiming that Li was mentally unstable and needed treatment. However, after Ge Lin investigated, Li was found not to be mentally ill but actually pregnant. The Society, fearing the news would leak, used the guise of mental illness to send her to Minhang for a secret birth. Ge Lin found it suspicious that Li was underage and pregnant and requested the District Procuratorate to investigate thoroughly. The District Procuratorate previously sent forensic doctor Wei Ligong to Minhang for an examination, and Li was indeed found to be pregnant and about to give birth. Yesterday, Prosecutor Yu Yixin opened the court for investigation, and Ge Lin attended and requested an investigation into who had sexually assaulted Li. As no one from the accused China Relief Society appeared in court, the hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices: Expired, Invalid; Each Dou of Rice Must Weigh 15 Jin (City Pounds); Strict Punishment for Confirmed Defalcation and Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to Ji Mingzhai, Section Chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau: Rice distribution for March is divided into two phases, the first phase from the 1st to the 12th, and the second phase from the 16th to the 28th. Distribution certificates from the first phase are not valid for the second phase, and all expired certificates will be invalid. The rice distributed this month is rice belonging to our government. Each person receives one dou. Next month, the distribution of American relief rice will begin. The total distribution volume for this month is 500,000 dan. The rice shops that are authorized to distribute rice are determined by the People's Food Allocation Committee based on their actual sales reported in December of last year. Those whose monthly sales are less than 60 shi do not have the right to distribute rice. If a rice shop authorized to distribute rice this month sells less than 60 shi, its authorization will also be revoked next month. If the sales situation is good and all rice is sold out, they can apply to increase the distribution quota. The rice certificate states that each dou of rice must weigh 15 jin (city pounds). Strict punishment will be given if defalcation or fraud is discovered.</p>
<p>After the full rice allocation system was implemented in this city, it was originally stipulated that in addition to the one dou allocated to each person, another certificate would be issued to restrict purchases of one dou at free market prices, and no more could be purchased. Now, due to the floating population in this city and the fact that some citizens have large appetites, this restriction has been relaxed. Those without certificates can also purchase rice in the free market, but they cannot buy too much. If it is felt that the method of restricting purchases of one dou with a certificate is no longer needed next month, it will be cancelled, and only one dou will be allocated by the government, with the rest left to citizens to obtain from the free market.</p>

<h3>Drawing Method</h3>
<p>When the lottery was drawn, thousands of citizens went to the stadium to watch. The stadium gate was decorated with colorful county flags. A temporary drawing platform was set up in the sports field, illuminated by bright mercury lights. The drawing equipment was borrowed from the Central Savings Society and consisted of three globe-shaped steel drawing balls that could rotate up and down. The ball in the center of the stage, called the A ball, was about two feet in diameter. The balls on the left and right, called the B and C balls, were about one foot in diameter. The number balls were about the size of bullets. The 600,000 lottery tickets for the Group B houses were divided into 50 groups, with each group (i.e., each character) having 12,000 tickets, numbered from 00000 to 11999, for a total of 12,000 numbers. The drawing method involved shaking each of the three balls separately and then combining the results. The first ball shaken was the C ball, which contained 50 small balls engraved with characters such as "Ju" (巨), "Que" (闕), "Zhu" (珠), "Cheng" (稱), etc., representing the group of the lottery ticket. The second ball was the B ball, which contained 12 small balls engraved with numbers 00 to 11, representing the first two digits of the lottery ticket number. The third ball was the A ball, which contained 1,000 small balls engraved with numbers 000 to 999, representing the last three digits of the lottery ticket number. The combined result of each shake of the three balls was the winning number for a certain group. The character drawn from the C ball was not returned to the ball for the second draw, while the numbers drawn from the A and B balls were returned to the balls for the second draw. This process was repeated 50 times to obtain the 50 winning numbers.</p>
<p>Various Representatives Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>The drawing ceremony began at 2:25 PM. Around 2:00 PM, the stands were already crowded with people. The staff of the Winter Relief Committee, led by Director-General Wang Xianqing, were busy with the arrangements. Supervisor Yan Zhuang, Jiangsu Inspector; Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Yuan Wenzhang, Division Chief; Xu Jilong of the City Chamber of Commerce; Chen Hanbing of the Local Court; Quan Dian of the District Procuratorate; Feng Youzhen of the Journalists Association; Wang Zhengyi of the Federation of Trade Unions; Chen Yide, representative of the City Party Headquarters, and other representatives from various sectors arrived one after another. Mayor Wu arrived at 2:15 PM, and the ceremony began shortly thereafter. First, the mayor gave a speech stating that the cost of the Group B houses was estimated at 800 million based on March prices, while the market value was over 1.6 billion. Recently, some people have suspected that the lottery method for the charity tickets is not transparent. Today's drawing here should dispel such unfounded rumors.</p>
<p>Nearly 100,000 Tickets Not Sold</p>
<p>Wang Xianqing then reported that out of the 600,000 Group B tickets, 504,169 had been sold, and the remaining unsold tickets were being kept by the City Bank. Less than half of the Group A tickets have been sold so far, so the drawing has been postponed to April 16. After explaining the lottery method, Wang began the drawing at 2:45 PM. First, the character balls and number balls were placed into the three large A, B, and C balls. Supervisor Yan Zhuang checked to make sure everything was correct. When placing the number balls from 000 to 199, some accidentally fell to the ground. All the balls were carefully checked to show due diligence. Each shake involved three rotations, and then the gate was opened, and one small ball from each of the three large balls rolled out and into a pre-placed glass cylinder. The staff announced the numbers in front of the microphone, hung them on a blackboard, and filled them in on a red sign on the wall. At the same time, the Victory Radio Station broadcast the progress of the drawing for citizens to listen to. The first group drawn was the "Shi" (始) group, and the last group drawn was the "Ju" (巨) group. The entire drawing was completed at 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Redeem Certificates with Tickets Starting on the 5th</h3>
<p>As for the names of the winners of the winning numbers, it was still impossible to determine them yesterday. Anyone who finds themselves to be a lucky winner can bring their tickets to the Winter Relief Committee's Housing Charity Group at the City Chamber of Commerce starting on March 5 to exchange them for a certificate. They can move in after the houses are built.</p>
<p>Before the drawing, Mayor Wu reported that he had received letters from Zhu Chenglie and Zhu Chengyong, students of the affiliated elementary school of Nanyang Middle School, each of whom used 1 million yuan of their New Year's money to buy 10 Group B charity tickets. If they won, they were willing to donate the proceeds from the sale of the house to scholarship funds. Another anonymous person also wrote that they had purchased 10 Group B tickets and, if they won, would also donate them to winter relief. Unfortunately, none of the 30 tickets won.</p>

<h3>Annual Production of Five Million Trees: Largest Export Commodity; Timber: Planting, Felling, Transport, and Sales</h3>
<p>[Report from Fuzhou on February 27 via airmail] In Fujian Province, regardless of the season, the largest export commodity is timber. The term "Jian Timber" is very familiar in South China, North China, and even Southeast Asia and the Philippines. It is produced in many corners of Fujian Province, with Jian'ou and Jianyang in the Min River basin being the most famous production areas. Other counties such as Shaxian, Shuiji, Songxi, Zhenghe, Shunchang, Chong'an, Gutian, Youxi, Nanping, Yong'an, Changting, Longyan, Datian, and Yongding are also areas where forests are concentrated. According to pre-war statistics, the annual production in the Min River area alone was about 3.9 million trees, the Ting River area had 900,000 trees, the Jiulong River had 170,000 trees, and other areas had about 200,000 trees, for a total of 5 million trees. Multiplying this number by today's currency value yields an enviable amount.</p>
<p>There are many types of "Jian Timber," mainly including fir, pine, camphor, paulownia, Phoebe zhennan, rosewood, Chinese tallow tree, Phoebe, Cunninghamia lanceolata, poplar, and boxwood, among dozens of others. However, in terms of exports, fir and pine are the most common. Today, the timber flowing down the Min River, transported through Mawei, and loaded onto ships in batches to the south and north is almost entirely these two types. This type of timber all comes from deep mountains and wilderness. Tracing its ancestry, transmission, and sales process offers a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Planting: Diligent Cultivation, Renewal</p>
<p>Given the massive annual logging and continuous exports, Fujian timber is by no means naturally grown and thriving. It requires very planned and patient diligent cultivation, and this must be done every year through "renewal" work. In the counties of northern Fujian, the one million or more timber farmers generally plan the next year's planting in the autumn. First, they use the high winds and dry weather of autumn and winter to burn the mountains, then use the remaining ash and charcoal as fertilizer. When spring comes and it is time to plant and sprout, they transplant a large number of seedlings. In the first ten years, they must weed under each tree at least once a year. After ten years, when the trees have grown large and provide shade, they burn the mountains again, using the remaining ashes as fertilizer for the second batch of seedlings. Generally, a piece of timber needs to grow for 20 years, which means each tree needs to have 20 "growth rings" in its cross-section before it can become timber. (Generally, "正材" (standard timber) refers to timber that is more than six inches in diameter.) At this point, it can be felled at will, the roots removed completely, and then new seedlings are replaced in the same way. Generally, the mountain tops have strong winds and little water, making it difficult for trees to grow large, so seedlings are mostly planted on the sides of the mountains, where they can thrive more easily.</p>
<p>Felling: Determining the Direction Before the Axe</p>
<p>Felling timber is a rather difficult and arduous task. In the deep mountains and dense forests, it takes a lot of effort to use only axes and manpower to topple trees that have been rooted for decades and weigh tens of thousands of pounds. Fortunately, the Chinese have inherited a wealth of experience from ancient times, and the loggers also know how to use scientific principles. At the beginning of the axe swing, they first determine the "direction" of the tree, then open up the side in that direction. After cutting seven or eight tenths of the way through the wood, they use ropes to pull it down. After that, they cut off the branches and leaves, remove the bark, and then cut it into various types of timber according to its length and size. The ones that are the full length are called "long tips." Those that are one zhang six to one zhang four are called "standard timber." Those that are one zhang two are called "barrel timber." Those that are one zhang are called "横丹" (horizontal dan). Those that are eight chi are called "一比" (one bi). Anything less than eight chi is discarded as miscellaneous timber.</p>
<p>The loggers have a specialized nature and are all hired from other places. Currently, the daily wage can be 70,000 to 80,000, but it is extremely dangerous, and there is often the possibility of being crushed to death by trees. The logging foremen once implemented an extremely strict "unilateral rule" stipulating that the foreman only had to pay 5,000 yuan for each worker who was crushed to death. This "rule" has not been abolished to this day. A human life is worth less than a youtiao (fried dough stick), which is extremely lamentable.</p>
<p>Transport: Relying Entirely on Mountain Streams; Five Procedures</p>
<p>Because timber is felled entirely in the mountains, transport relies almost entirely on mountain streams. Therefore, the first step is to move the timber to the side of the stream. Regarding this, there are five procedures: (1) "Opening the road"; (2) "Arranging bamboo," that is, placing bamboo rafts for walking and working; (3) Releasing into the stream: transporting the timber to the side of the stream; (4) Stamping: stamping the timber with the iron seal of the "business" or "gang" for identification; (5) Building rafts: This structure is extremely complex and is something that researchers of timber transport and sales cannot ignore. The so-called "raft building" method is divided into three layers. The smallest unit is the tree, followed by the "du" (笃), and then the "yun" (运). Each du is based on the size of the timber, with some having five trees (called five-bottomed) and some having seven trees (called seven-bottomed), divided into 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, and 30 types. Anything beyond 30 bottoms is called "捆根" (bundled roots). Then, the "du" is merged into "lian" (连). Usually, the "yun" is also divided into 6 du, 7 du, 8 du, 12 du, 14 du, and other types. Then, bamboo nails and ropes are added. Once the spring floods come, it can be transported down the river. (Usually, it takes four to five months to a year from felling to transport.) Moreover, according to the old system, the workers transporting the timber had to change shifts three times. The first shift pushed from various upstream areas to Nanping, the second shift pushed from Nanping to Shuikou, and the third shift released it from Shuikou to Fuzhou. Each did not infringe on the other's territory, otherwise, a lawsuit would immediately be filed. According to statistics, during the peak period, the number of timber transported down the Min River each month reached 2,500 to 3,000 yun.</p>
<p>Sales: Domestic and Foreign, Far and Wide</p>
<p>The sales situation of "Jian Timber" can be divided into two categories: domestic and foreign. One is to purchase and transport it from the production area to Fuzhou, and the other is to transship it from Fuzhou to other ports (mainly Qingdao, Tianjin, Yingkou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Shanghai). Currently, there are two main factions operating in this business in Fuzhou. One is the "company faction," including Overseas Chinese, China Forest Company, Xingye Company, Jimei Company, Huatong Company, Fujian Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Company, and a large number of merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The other is the "muke" (木客) gang. This faction is weak but large in numbers. They are mostly responsible for transporting and selling goods from the production area to Fuzhou. Because they have little capital, they are severely exploited. There are many disguised timber businesses in Fuzhou that specialize in offering high-interest loans. The target is this group of muke. In addition to having to sell the timber to the business at the time, borrowers still have to calculate interest and pay commissions. Furthermore, the remaining funds must be repaid within ten days. Under this system, the situation of the timber farmers is extremely tragic. There is a story (which actually happened recently): A family in a certain county in northern Fujian has been a timber farmer for three generations. The grandfather planted the trees, the father felled the trees, and the son transported the trees to Fuzhou for sale. As a result, after deducting transportation costs and debt repayment, they only had enough money to buy a cotton blanket to bring back for the winter. The miserable life of the timber farmers in Fujian is evident. Due to frequent price increases in the production areas and high transportation costs, general companies are also reluctant to move forward. In addition, the situation in North China has recently become tense, and the sales routes to the north have almost been cut off, creating widespread panic in the forestry industry. According to Chen Peizhi, Deputy Manager of Overseas Chinese China Forestry Company, major companies had already reported losses half a year ago. Currently, the profit margin for timber transported from Fuzhou to Shanghai, excluding shipping costs, is less than one-tenth. The only solution is to stockpile it in warehouses and wait for prices to rise. Currently, the number of local materials stockpiled in Fuzhou, Nanping, and Shanghai has gradually become considerable. It is still difficult to predict when it can be sold off...</p>
<p>General opinion is that the future of "Jian Timber" is worrisome. Because timber farmers cannot make a profit, the planting of new trees has disappeared in the past two years. If this continues year after year, the source of "Jian Timber" will be completely cut off in ten or twenty years. However, the government cannot currently prohibit free felling, otherwise, the lives of millions of timber farmers will be completely devastated. How to support timber farmers, open up sales channels, plant more trees, and improve transport and sales methods should be the main tasks of the agricultural and forestry authorities in Fujian Province.

<h3>Fujian to Establish a Provincial Forest Bureau: Suggests Increasing Allocations for Afforestation Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper in Fuzhou on the 1st] In order to strengthen forest management and administration, Fujian Province has recently decided to establish a provincial forest bureau within this year, dividing it into four districts: Min River, Longting, Jinzhang, and Min East. Each district will have a forest management agency. Agricultural extension offices will be established in all counties, and forest protection associations will be established in all townships to strictly prohibit wasteful felling. The expenses for this will be collected from "forest owners" and "muke" (timber merchants), called "afforestation funds." The remainder will be a suggestion to the central government to add an "afforestation loan" item under agricultural loans to enable widespread afforestation.</p>
<h3>Fujian Reforms Tenancy System: Expands Rent Restriction Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper in Fuzhou on February 28 via airmail] In order to actively reform the provincial tenancy system, Fujian Province, in addition to handling the work of supporting self-cultivating farmers in Longyan County before the new year and continuing to handle the work of supporting cultivation in Ningde, Shanghang, and other counties, has recently ordered county governments to supervise township offices to investigate the area of cultivated land in their jurisdiction, the names of the main products, and the quantity of harvest units, and to expand propaganda about the 37.5% rent restriction, guide farmers in revising lease contracts, and mediate disputes between landlords and tenants, thereby benefiting farmers.</p>

<h3>Lanzhou University Prevents Escalation of Situation: Intensifies Control Measures Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper in Lanzhou on February 29] Regarding the Lanzhou University incident, the reporter interviewed Lanzhou University's Dean of Student Affairs Duan Zimei, Dean of the Law School Xiang Yuxu, and Dean of Academic Affairs Xun Shuangqiu. They stated that the rights and wrongs of the Lanzhou University incident should naturally be adjudicated by the Garrison Headquarters. They tried their best to dissuade the students from marching beforehand to no avail, but they sent two deans of student affairs to accompany the group. Fortunately, the marching order was good. Yesterday, upon hearing rumors from the outside world, they deeply feared that lawless elements would mix into the school and cause incidents, escalating the situation. Therefore, they strengthened the gate security. When asked whether they had heard about the discovery of reactionary slogans yesterday, Duan replied: It is said that a man named Wei Yanling posted them and has been arrested by the security authorities. Since there are clues, the truth can be revealed. However, I guarantee that it was not done by university students and promise that, starting today, the actions of the students can be controlled. It was also reported that the Lanzhou University student-organized "February 25 Tragedy Support Association" announced on the 29th that it would use the former name internally and the name of all Lanzhou University students externally. The reporter met its representative, Xue Xiqing. He stated that regarding the motivation, general student views, and hopes of supporting injured classmates, he said firmly that the students of Lanzhou University absolutely trust the fair handling of the Garrison Headquarters but firmly demand the realization of four conditions. Recently, it has been heard that unscrupulous elements from the outside world have taken the opportunity to incite them. I can represent all the students to express that the purpose is absolutely pure, and the actions are absolutely simple. All external documents of the school's students have a stamp as proof. The records of each gathering in the school are absolutely public. The school has already requested the security authorities to prevent any intentional slander from the outside world, and the school's students will also examine themselves. The only way is to prove the school's position with facts in the future.</p>

<h3>Lieutenant General Advisor Turns Pickpocket</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Office, February 25th] The Chengdu Police Department yesterday arrested an elderly pickpocket. He trespassed into a residence in Caojia Lane, outside the North Gate, early in the morning, and stole clothing drying in the yard. He alarmed the owner, who shouted for his arrest, and he was taken into police custody. During interrogation, he tearfully wrote a statement, claiming his name was Shi Ce, age sixty-eight. In his youth, he graduated from the Army Rapid Training Academy, and joined the military soon after marriage, accumulating meritorious service. He participated in the Northern Expedition, bandit suppression, and the War of Resistance. In the eighteenth year of the Republic, he represented Liu Xiang as the Director of the Guangdong Office. During the war, he served as a Lieutenant General Advisor to the Sichuan-Kangsu (Sichuan-Xikang) Pacification Commissioner's Office. After the victory, he was assigned to the 28th Army Officer Corps. He was discharged two years ago and has been unemployed ever since. With the high cost of living, his family property was completely exhausted, leading to separation from his wife and children. Coupled with old age and illness, and no means of support, he also developed an addiction. Unwilling to starve to death, he was forced to resort to pickpocketing. His handwriting and writing style were both elegant and readable. When he recounted his glorious experiences during the Sichuan Army's internal wars, he couldn't help but shed tears of old age. The presiding military judge was moved by his plight and released him. He began to wander off into the twilight, humming the line, "Where to go, at the edge of the sky so vast?"</p>

<h3>New and Old County Magistrates Hand Over Duties; Disaster Relief Rice Turns into Sugar Lumps</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Office, February 28th] A "switch" of disaster relief rice occurred before and after the handover of duties between the new and old county magistrates of Ningde County, Fujian. It is said that the former county magistrate, Huang Guangyu, received more than 290 tons of disaster relief rice allocated by the Executive Yuan for the Xipitang reclamation project in the county. Two hundred tons were transported and distributed during his tenure, and the rice quality was still good. The remaining ninety tons were stored in Fuzhou. In January of this year, Huang was transferred, and Liu Dexin took over the vacancy. After taking office, Liu began transporting the rice. However, when the rice, about 1,800 piculs, worth over a billion (currency unspecified) was transported to the county seat a few days ago, it had all turned into broken rice and bran lumps. Moreover, it was moldy and unfit for consumption, causing a great uproar throughout the county. An investigation is currently underway at the Fuzhou headquarters.</p>

<h3>Examining Zhejiang's Highway Construction from the Perspective of Traffic Control for Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 1st] Zhejiang's transportation was originally very convenient. Waterways could be used for travel, and land routes had the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways connecting the northeast and west. The development and quality of highways were particularly prominent in the country; only in the mountainous areas of southern Zhejiang was transportation more difficult. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Zhejiang's transportation was severely damaged, and the railways and highways were almost completely destroyed. After more than two years of recovery, due to financial difficulties, only the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line and slightly less than two-thirds of the highways have been repaired. The reporter has reported extensively on the progress of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and under the grand objective of "traffic control for bandit suppression," highway transportation in Zhejiang Province is becoming increasingly important. Recovery and construction have also made considerable progress, so I am also reporting this to readers who are concerned about national construction. The era of Zhejiang's highways began between the 5th and 16th years of the Republic of China. The provincial government used the tobacco tax revenue to build the Xiaoshao, Shengxin, and Huangze sections, totaling eighty-seven kilometers. At the same time, it encouraged merchants to invest in the construction of the Hangyu, Yulin, Yuwu, Hangfu, and Pinghu Sang road lines, totaling one hundred eighty-eight kilometers. At that time, the average construction cost per kilometer was only six thousand yuan. After the 16th year of the Republic of China, due to political stability, a comprehensive plan was undertaken, and a provincial road network was planned. The province and merchants simultaneously actively carried out the plan. Among them, the larger projects were the Zhejiang-Fujian, Zhejiang-Anhui, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines. By the 23rd year, two thousand nine hundred and six kilometers had been built. The Luopu, Qin, Longpu, Jiangpu, Fengxin, and Xintianlin lines, which were previously considered difficult to construct, were also completed one after another. In the 24th and 25th years, the Hangjue, Jiahai, and Lisong lines, totaling four hundred and seventy kilometers, were completed. In the first half of the 26th year, the Kaijiang Road, Jiaxing District Transportation Road, and Yongruiping Road, totaling more than three hundred kilometers, were completed, reaching a total of three thousand seven hundred and seventeen kilometers before the transportation (referring to full completion). By this time, the provincial highway network had been largely completed. At that time, in terms of area, there was one kilometer of highway for every twenty square kilometers; in terms of county territory, except for the counties of Qingyuan, Jining, Xianju, Yuhuan, and Dinghai, which were mostly mountains or isolated islands in the sea, all other counties could communicate with each other. However, the flames of the Japanese invaders destroyed so much of the crystallization of so much blood and sweat! Zhejiang borders Shanghai, and Hangzhou and Jiaxing fell first. The coastal highways of Ningbo were deliberately destroyed for strategic reasons; and in May of the 31st year, when the enemy invaded Quzhou and Lishui, the highways suffered the deepest damage. At that time, only the Longpu Road, totaling ninety-three kilometers, remained. Later, as the situation improved, repairs were gradually made. Until the eve of victory, there were still the Longquan-Qingyuan, Jiangshan-Pucheng, Jiangshan-Changshan, Tangshan-Chunan, Caoping-Changshan, Huabu-Zhejiang, Fengling, Yiduguan-Youtou-Badu eight lines, totaling 768.10 kilometers. After the victory, the Traffic Management Office conducted an emergency repair. In the 36th year, the office was changed to the Highway Bureau, and continued to advance (repair) . By August of the 36th year, the repaired routes included the Ligang Road (Lishui Chanshan to Dagangtou), Jiangyou Road (Jiangshan through Qujiang, Longyou, Lanxi to Jinhua), Shengyong Road (Shengxian through Dongyang to Yongkang), Biyou Road (Nanshan through Bihu to Longyou), Liyong Road (Lishui through Jinyun to Yongkang), Hangxian Road (Hangzhou through Shaoxing, Cao'e to Shengxian), Hangwen Road (Hangzhou through Yuhang, Lin'an, Yuqian, Changhua to Wenlingguan), Jinghang Road (Hangzhou through Wukang, Wuxing, Changxing to Wenshi), Yin Feng Road (Yinxian to Fenghua Xikou), Lanbai Road (Lanxi through Shouchang to Baisha), Liutang (leaving the (Qiantang) Qianjiang Bridge) Line, Hangtang Road (Sima to Tangqi section), Gongsan section (Gongchen Bridge to Sanlang Temple), Huhang Road (Hangzhou through Haining, Haiyan to Jinsiniang Bridge), Moqian Mountain Branch Line, Puzhong Road (Zhengjiawu to Pujiang), Yidong Road (Yiwu to Dongyang), Hangchun Road (Hangzhou through Tonglu, Jiande to Chun'an), Shangguan Line Shengxin section (Shengxian through Xinchang, Tiantai, Linhai, Huangyan to Zeguo), Zhapingjia Road (Zhapu through Pinghu to Jiaxing), Jiahai Road (Jiaxing through Wangjiangjing, Pingwang to Wuxing), Caoguan Road (Cao'e to Guanhaiwei), Guan Yin Road (Guanhaiwei to Ningbo), Fengxin Road (Xikou to Xinchang), Fenghai Road (Fenghua to Ninghai), Xuanwu Road (Xuanping to Wuyi), Yuwu Road (Yuhang to Penggong Huanghu), Zhenluo Road (Zhenhai to Luotuo Bridge), Siluo Road (Sixi to Luotuo Bridge), Luzhou Branch Line, Changgong Road (Changxing through Si'an to Guangquan), Fangyan Branch Line, Changyuan Branch Line, Tianlin Huangze Road (Tiantai through Linhai, Huangyan to Zeguo), Xintian Road (Xinchang to Tiantai), and other 36 lines, for a total of 2,252 kilometers repaired. Among them, there were 586 kilometers that were already open to traffic, but due to insufficient public funds and simple engineering, they still needed to be improved. By the end of the 36th year, another 338 kilometers had been repaired. There are 1,008 kilometers of routes that are being planned and implemented, or have already started construction locally, and are expected to be open to traffic this year. In Zhejiang Province, under the grand objective of traffic control for bandit suppression, this year it has been decided to complete twelve major trunk lines to meet military needs: the Chang (xing) Guang (de) line, the Hua (bu) Zheng (yuan) line, the Long (quan) Qing (yuan) line, the An (ji) Si (shui) line, the Yu (hang) Bai (guan) line, the Lan (xi) Pu (jiang) line, the Lin (hai) Xian (ju) line, the Yu (qian) Qian (qiuguan) line, the Yun (he) Jing (ning) line, the Tong (lu) Fen (shui) line, the Yu (hang) Wu (kang) line, and the Sanmen line, totaling 546 kilometers of highways. In order to facilitate the suppression of bandits in the Siming Mountain Pacification Zone, highways will be built from the county seats of Yuyao, Shangyu, Shengxian, Cixi, Fenghua, Xinchang, and Zhuji to Qingtinggang in Siming Mountain, using Qingtinggang as the center. In order to facilitate the suppression of bandits on the border between Zhejiang and Fujian, the governments of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces will cooperate to build the Qingyuan (Zhejiang) to Zhenghe (Fujian) highway. The Highway Bureau plans to build and has surveyed new roads, including the Yu'an and Zhensi roads, which are important routes to Anhui, the Sanmen Xia Line, the Shaolan Road, the Yu Bai Road, and the Shanhuan Xia Line, five routes.</p>
<p>Zhejiang's highway construction is far less in terms of quantity than two-thirds of what was formerly (the total highway quantity before the war), and in terms of quality, it is not as flat and strong as the original. However, opening the map, most of the provincial roads have been connected to various counties, such as Yuyao and other counties, and almost all towns in the county are connected (by road). As for neighboring provinces, there are already the Jinghang and Huhang National Highways connecting to Jiangsu, the Hangchuan National Highway and the Chun'an Huabu provincial road connecting to Anhui, and the Huabu Shanyuan, Changshan Yushan, Jiangshan Guangfeng, and Zheling Guangfeng four lines connecting to Jiangxi. Connecting to Fujian, there are the Zhemin National Highway, and the Long (quan) Pu (cheng) provincial road. Adding the planned routes, it can be truly said to be connected in all directions. However, the simplicity of the road surface and the lack of vehicles need to be greatly improved. This year is Zhejiang's year of construction. We hope that these three words "Year of Construction" are not just a slogan, not just to boost the morale of the staff, but to truly put the focus of provincial administration on construction and restore the vitality lost by the people of Zhejiang due to the war. The reporter deeply hopes that the future highway construction in Zhejiang will not only expand into new areas in terms of quantity, but also take into account the standards in terms of quality, and quickly complete permanent construction.

<h3>Xi'an Lantern Market</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Office, February 27th] If the winter in Chang'an is like an ink painting, with black representing people, dry trees, and crows, and white representing ice, boxes, and snow, and gray representing the sky, then after the Lunar New Year until the Lantern Festival, new colors are painted everywhere, and its splendor resembles a three-color halftone illustration or a five-color motion picture. Looking at the lantern market everywhere, with ten thousands of reds and greens, carved silver foil gold, we are reminded of the Chang'an lanterns described in old novels such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," whose beauty and liveliness are not exaggerated. At night, with the moon full and round, one sees a red lantern sending away the demons of winter and welcoming the god of spring, like a fishing line hooking up the beautiful childhood memories of many people. Moreover, just like paper-cut flowers, New Year pictures, and woodcut door gods, the Lantern Festival lanterns can also be studied from the perspectives of peasant folk art and folk customs. It reflects a side view of the Northwest countryside.</p>
<p>Although Chang'an is the imperial capital of past dynasties, the lanterns, whether in form, subject matter, or patterns, do not retain much of the imperial atmosphere. This proves on the contrary that lanterns originate from peasant soil.</p>
<p>In the author's memories of returning to his hometown from the coast of the South China Sea, our hometown has the most types and sizes of fish lanterns, as well as lanterns with themes of shellfish, shrimp, and crabs...These are some seafood-themed lanterns. Chang'an is located on the Northwest Plateau, far from the coast, so it's no wonder that in the lantern market, after searching for a long time, there is only one kind of goldfish lantern. It is probably modeled after the fish raised in a glass tank.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are many kinds of lanterns of animals and livestock here, which we don't have in our hometown. The Chang'an lantern market has many horse lanterns (not revolving lanterns), and occasionally some camels, donkeys, monkeys, and unknown wild birds and livestock. The people of Chang'an do not completely avoid white in the New Year, and white horse lanterns and white rabbit lanterns sell well. White horse lanterns are considered inauspicious by Cantonese people. It is difficult to see fresh lotus flowers in summer here, but the lotus flower lanterns are made more exquisitely than those made in the Jiangnan coastal areas. Each petal of the lotus flower is carefully traced with gold water to outline the veins of the petals, and the tips of the petals are wrapped in golden tips. This style clearly follows the lotus flowers painted in Buddhist statues. Reflecting the invasion of Western civilization, such as cars, trains, ships, and airplanes, there are fewer such lanterns than in the coastal areas of Jiangnan. I have not seen half a ship lantern to this day. Last year, an elementary school teacher made some airplane lanterns based on the designs in the newspaper, such as the "Spitfire," "Lightning," and "Black Widow" models, but the result was such a failure that he didn't dare to "try again" this year. This year, a type of airplane lantern with a "fantasy style" is popular, and the form is very interesting: the wings are transformed into two large triangular flags, and the edges of the flags are decorated with serrated tassels. The propeller has been changed to a windmill, and the elevators and rudder behind the plane have been changed to the tail feathers of birds. I firmly believe that this is a creative and reflective shape, and the beauty of a high-speed, airborne machine is "viewed as such" in the eyes of simple farmers. This is like a daydream, and it is also like Dali's "Surrealism."</p>
<p>Some of the lanterns here directly use bird feathers and animal fur pasted on the lantern paper. The author doesn't know if there are similar "realistic" methods elsewhere, so I record this together for those who are concerned with peasant folk art.</p>

<h3>Using Stilts to Promote the Prohibition Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Office, February 26th] The enforcement of the prohibition policy has always been a difficult and unrewarding task in Shaanxi, but since Yan'an was liberated and the situation in northern Shaanxi became clear last spring, the provincial government has sealed off 3,103 acres of opium poppy fields in one year. This most thorough method has already proven its effectiveness with numbers. According to the latest statistics, more than 5,800 taels of drugs were seized and 3,000 drug cases were handled in the province last year, which is clearly a reduction of one-half to two-thirds compared to the more than 18,000 taels seized and the more than 6,000 drug cases handled in the previous year.</p>
<p>Of course, we are still far from completely eradicating (opium), for example, the repeated extensions of the deadline for warning smokers in this city to quit show that this is difficult to achieve "in one fell swoop." These days, during the Lantern Festival, "Shehu (local opera performances)" and "high stilts" are mobilized everywhere, and using the method of "new wine in old bottles", using "high stilts" to promote the prohibition policy has given the citizens a deep impression.</p>
<p>"Wangxiangmen" is the execution ground in Xi'an for opium offenders, so some "high stilts" are also writing eye-catching slogans: "Outside Yuxiangmen, turn back as soon as possible." (Our reporter, Mai Ye)</p>

<h3>Education Ministry Exchange Students to France Will Go to Beijing Next Week for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Office] The exchange students to France selected by the Ministry of Education in the 35th year of the Republic of China have not been sent abroad even after more than two years. It is learned that students Gu Shouguan, Zuo Jingquan, and Xiong Shiheng are extremely anxious. They have organized an alumni association in Shanghai to discuss the matter of going abroad, and will go to Beijing next week to request instructions from the Ministry of Education, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the National Political Council, and the National Government.</p>
<h3>Ying Shi University Meteorological Observatory Began Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Jinhua Office, 1st] The Ying Shi University College of Agriculture meteorological observatory has been partially arranged and began work today, and is regularly in contact with the Central Meteorological Bureau.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Private Schools Apply to Increase Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Office] The Municipal Education Bureau previously stipulated the fee standards for private primary and secondary schools in the city, stipulating that if any school has special circumstances such as excellent management, it may increase the fees by 20% of the stipulated standard after submitting an application to the Education Bureau for approval. As of yesterday, more than 100 schools had applied to the Education Bureau for an increase. The Education Bureau has sent personnel to investigate the economic situation and management of each school, and will approve them one after another. After all the cases have been closed, the list of schools approved to increase fees will be announced.</p>
<h3>Coordinating and Distributing Continuing Education Funds; Half Required to Be Deposited in the City Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Office] For the academic continuing education fees for this semester in the city's national schools, the Education Bureau personally decided that in addition to retaining half to be distributed to teachers in each school in advance, the remaining half must be deposited in the City Bank by March 5th. The Education Bureau has hired Chen [Name Illegible] Xing, Su Toufu, Yu Zunwu, Zhu Zuo Cai, Wang Dingcheng, Xue Chuan, Mei Guang Dao, Huang Yuan Kai, Lu Mao Yan, Li Zhan Ren, Wei Qiong Sheng, Huang She Shi, Sheng Zhi Gong, Yang Yang En, Wang Shao Sheng, Mao Wen Pei, Guan Zhao Wen, Feng Xian Cheng, Huang Qi Cheng, Tan Shi Heng, Kong Fan Xi, Song Chao Zhi, [Name Illegible] Ren Gong, Sun Zhen Chun, [Name Illegible] Ming, Wang Li Ben, Ru Ji Lang, Song Jun Mei, and Gu Yin Qian, 29 people in total, to form a committee to coordinate and distribute the funds.</p>
<h3>Education Ministry Orders All Agencies and Schools Not to Request Subsidies at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Our Office] The Ministry of Education recently issued a notice to agencies and schools in various regions, stating that the necessary funds should be comprehensively planned in advance in accordance with the approved temporary and regular budget, and subsidies should not be requested at any time in order to emphasize the budget. The notice did not mention any measures to remedy the difficulties caused by the continuous rise in prices.</p>
<h3>Church Universities Fundraising: North China Region Performs Better</h3>
<p>[Our Office] The amount of funds raised by the thirteen church universities nationwide is still far from the target. The East China region has raised 4 billion (currency unspecified). The North China region has performed better. Yanjing University alone has raised 300 million (currency unspecified), and Qilu University has raised 2 billion (currency unspecified). No other reports have been received yet.</p>
<h3>The Zhongzheng Cultural District Must Be Relocated</h3>
<p>[Our Office] The former sites of the Longhua and Hualong Bridge airfields in the city were purchased by the city government by issuing public bonds before the war, and are now public land owned by the city. The Municipal Education Bureau had planned to move and concentrate the city's middle schools there to establish the Zhongzheng Cultural District, but the sites of the two airfields are currently being used by the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, and after several negotiations, no results have been achieved. The municipal meeting has now decided to sell the public land to the Civil Aviation Administration, so the Education Bureau must purchase land elsewhere to build the Zhongzheng Cultural District.</p>
<h3>The Education Bureau is Encouraging Industrial and Commercial Circles to Establish Vocational Supplementary Schools</h3>
<p>Teaching Subjects Will Be Submitted to the Bureau Affairs Meeting for Discussion</p>
<p>[Our Office] In order to facilitate the promotion of the establishment of vocational supplementary schools by various factories, companies, stores, and groups, the Municipal Education Bureau has formulated the subjects required to be established in vocational supplementary schools and their weekly teaching hours. After more than two months of investigation and research, it has achieved concrete results and will be submitted to the next Bureau Affairs Meeting for discussion. The Education Bureau is now encouraging various industry trade associations to establish these supplementary schools. The Education Bureau will not appoint the principals and teachers, but will be hired by the industry trade associations themselves. Since each industry has its own professional technical subjects, the qualifications of teachers in vocational supplementary schools are not limited to those who have been examined and registered.</p>
<h3>City Normal School Students Petition for Increased Food Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Students of the Municipal Normal School recently petitioned the Education Bureau to increase food expenses and improve their living conditions, with the following three demands: (1) The school's food expenses for this month remain at 196,000 yuan, while the price of rice has risen from 24,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per斗 (a unit of dry volume), leaving only over 30,000 yuan for vegetables after paying for two斗 of rice, making it difficult to sustain. (2) After the adjustment of living expenses for civil servants in January, the students' public expenses should be 490,000 yuan per month. Please increase the allowance from this month onwards and make up for the difference that should have been issued in January and February. (3) In the future, when the cost of living index for civil servants is adjusted, student public expenses should also be increased accordingly.</p>
<h3>Speaking Up for Education (Continued from the 8th of last month)</h3>
<p>— Mo Zhongyi</p>
<p>Second: "Education is not an ornament or monopoly of the wealthy; everyone has equal access to education. This is the minimum requirement of a democratic country." This is correct, but this responsibility cannot be borne by education alone. Considering China's national economic situation, even if primary school to university education were free and provided with public funding, it would still be impossible to ensure that everyone has equal access to a good education. In the past month, our national education or compulsory education, and adult literacy education were all free, and even provided books and stationery. However, those who ran these educational programs deeply experienced the difficulty of recruiting and retaining students. Children and youths in rural and urban areas had to work in the fields, in factories, and at home; they simply did not have time to attend school. For the sake of their family's livelihood, even if you waive their tuition fees and insist on their enrollment, it would not help their actual living conditions. They are genuinely willing but unable. Even in universities and middle schools, during the War of Resistance against Japan, loan and public funding systems were implemented. For several years, although they greatly helped impoverished youths, maintaining this system and hoping for equal access to university and middle school education is truly difficult in China today, before the national economy is improved. Judging from China's single-track education system, education is not designed for the wealthy. From the perspective of China's educational aims and policies, education does not have the flavor of being an ornament or monopoly of the wealthy. But in reality, China's current education does have the characteristics of being an ornament or monopoly of the wealthy. That cannot be blamed on education, but should be blamed on the unreasonableness of China's economic system. To blame education itself for this is unfair, and I cannot help but speak up for education. "As for the treatment of normal school students, it cannot be seen as the same as the public funding for ordinary students," and this has already been resolved by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Graduates Have No Prospects, Is It Appropriate to Solely Blame Education?</p>
<p>Third: "Education hinders the development of social life." Mr. Zhang, based on his own experience, pointed out that receiving a middle school education does not necessarily earn more money than graduating from primary school, and graduating from university does not necessarily satisfy the family more than graduating from middle school. Therefore, he said that the only two paths for China's new intellectuals are to become officials or, if they cannot become officials, to teach, feeling that they have reached a dead end in life. Therefore, he believes that anyone can develop their talents and create a career in a certain environment, but Mr. Zhang, having received a university education, has lost the spirit and ability to create. He believes that this is due to traditional education—the education of books and literature—and that education is divorced from life, fostering a habit of not working, which hinders the development of social life. This kind of argument has long been mentioned by others. Proponents of productive labor education, vocational education, and social education often use this theory as a basis. However, this theory reverses cause and effect and is not consistent with the facts. In my view, modern education not only does not hinder the development of social life, but rather the lack of development of social life hinders modern education, causing education to suffer an unwarranted injustice. The purpose of education is not to teach people to make money, nor can it satisfy feudal ideas. Conversely, seeking a career or profit through education is the failure of education. The fact that China's new intellectuals have no prospects is not the fault of education, but the fault of society. If China's society is stagnant in all industries and educated people have no prospects, do those who have not been educated have prospects instead? If there is specialized knowledge but no place to use it, and this phenomenon of talent surplus is said to be the fault of education, then the only straightforward solution for education is not to exist. If education cannot meet the needs of society, then society should bear the greatest responsibility. If one expects education to cultivate talent on one hand and blames education for cultivating talent that has no market on the other, not only are those engaged in education at a loss, but even gods would find it difficult to help. In the current social environment of China, it would be a miracle if, as Mr. Zhang said, "anyone can develop their talents and create a career in a certain environment." Like Mr. Zhang, someone who "received a university education but lost the spirit and ability to create" did not suffer from education, but rather suffered from society. There are many university graduates who are promoted and become wealthy, and there are also many middle school students and primary school students, and even illiterate people, who rise to prominence. Is this the fault of education? To blame society's strange phenomena on education itself rather than on society is unjust and unfair.</p>
<p>Educators can be blamed for failing to instill a habit of labor in those who are educated, but to think that students' lack of labor habits hinders social development is not a fair argument. There are many laborers in China. It is estimated that farmers account for 80% of the country's population. Compared with educated people, the latter are truly rare. May I ask: What development of social life did China have before the implementation of new education? Education should cultivate various talents and have various facilities and environments. It is right that general education should not be divorced from daily life, but it does not matter if specialized education is divorced from daily life. A scientist or a writer who concentrates on his inventions or his creations, it is not surprising if his habits are divorced from daily life. As for criticizing traditional education as book education and literary education, that is also somewhat extreme. Mr. Zhang, can you create a new education system that does not use books or words? Productive labor education, vocational education, and social education have been promoted for more than a decade. The reason why there has been no significant progress is that trying to change education itself is like Sun Wukong trying to escape from the palm of the Buddha. The backwardness of social production, the stagnation of occupations, and the distress of the national livelihood make it difficult to develop education. This is truly the fatal wound of education. We can no longer reverse cause and effect and blame education.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Literacy Training Does Not Necessarily Stifle Individuality</p>
<p>As for Mr. Zhang's fourth point, that traditional education emphasizes the training of books and words, which stifles the individuality of young people and cultivates a group of bookworms and scholars, that is also not entirely true. Education cannot abandon books and words, as mentioned above. As for whether this stifles the individuality of young people and cultivates bookworms and scholars, that is also too arbitrary. Every school at every level, and even every school, inevitably has bookworms and scholars, and inevitably has students who skip school all day and have nothing to do with books. In my opinion, there are not too many bookworms and scholars like Mr. Zhang among the students in China today; on the contrary, there are too few. If education has stifled the individuality of Chinese youth, why was there the May Fourth Movement and subsequent student movements? I cannot understand this at all. Finally, Mr. Zhang complained that there is public funding available at university while his family at home is starving, and blamed this on education. Can education solve the problem of food for people other than those who are educated? Then education would truly be a panacea and an unsurpassed treasure. University graduates feel a sense of bleakness and despair about the future, which is due to the unreasonableness of politics and society, not the fault of education. Why do university graduates have prospects in other countries, while university students in our country are in despair? The reason is obvious. Considering that there is only one university student for every five thousand people in China, during a time of political stability, economic prosperity, and development in all industries, that is not enough no matter what. The fact that university graduates were reserved and snapped up by all sectors during the War of Resistance against Japan is clear evidence.</p>
<p>As for the shortcomings of education pointed out by Mr. Gu, the point about the examination system has been answered above. It is also not true to say that all levels of schools are preparing for further education. Of course, all levels of schools inevitably prepare for further education, but can you prohibit students' aspirations for further education? If it is said that students have few prospects after graduation other than continuing their education, then would creating an education system, such as a dual-track system, that prohibits a portion of students from pursuing further education solve the problem? To say that "education relies on the next higher level and fundamentally lacks its own independent personality" is not based on facts and is irresponsible. Elementary education implements national education, secondary education implements normal school education, vocational education, and middle school education to prepare for further education, and higher education implements specialized talent education. How can it be said that it "fundamentally" lacks its own independent personality? Mr. Gu concludes by saying: "Our current school education, other than being used for the wealthy to continue their education, is simply useless." I wonder if Mr. Gu has received "our current school education"? Are you "wealthy"? Are you "preparing for further education"? If there is one "no," then the statement that it is "useless" cannot stand. Even if you have received the current school education, you are wealthy, and you have already studied abroad and returned to your country after completing your studies, if there are many people who have received the current school education, but they are not wealthy, and they have not continued their education, but they still live in China and live in the human world, then the current school education should still be somewhat useful, right? China's education is often scolded by knowledgeable people. It is fine for people who do not understand education to scold it. But if someone in the education circle also wants to scold education to vent their anger, I think it is better to consider it first, so as not to be told by outsiders that you are too unambitious.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Basketball Team Flies from Qingdao to Shanghai This Morning; Will Play Qingbai at 7:30 Tonight; All Games Scheduled in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 1st] The U.S. Navy basketball team stationed in Qingdao, at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Basketball Committee, is scheduled to fly from Qingdao at 10:00 AM on the 2nd aboard a naval aircraft and will arrive at Jiangwan Airport around noon. The team consists of twelve people and will play four games in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our City News] The Qingdao U.S. Navy Marines basketball team was invited to Shanghai. The team telegraphed the Shanghai Basketball Committee yesterday, deciding to take a military plane at 8:00 AM today (2nd), arriving at Jiangwan Airport around 12:00 noon. The schedule for the visiting team's games in Shanghai, originally arranged by the Basketball Committee, had the first game between Renyu, but because many Renyu players were injured, they were unable to play today. The Basketball Committee then invited Qingbai to take their place, and the revised schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>2nd: vs. Qingbai 7:30 PM</p>
<p>3rd: vs. Hualian 8:30 PM</p>
<p>4th: vs. Dagong 8:30 PM</p>
<p>5th: vs. Mixed Team 8:30 PM</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule</p>
<p>Tonight's basketball league, originally scheduled to start at 5:30 PM with three games in Group A, will include a game as the Qingdao U.S. Navy Marines basketball team arrived in Shanghai today and will need to play tonight. The Basketball Committee decided to postpone the third game between Enkas and Qingbai, and Qingbai will instead play against the Marines. Tickets for tonight's game are 30,000 yuan upstairs, 60,000 yuan downstairs, and 100,000 yuan for reserved seats inside the court.</p>
<p>Referees Liu Hesheng and Yu Jvlv, the schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Jianle vs. Xinsheng (Group A2 A) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Indian vs. Dahua (Group A2 A) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Marines vs. Qingbai (Friendship Game) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Three Games</p>
<p>In the first game of Group A2 A, Jianle will face Xinsheng. Jianle was originally a strong team of veteran players, but after losing to the Huadian foreign soldiers a few days ago, they have reorganized significantly and are expected to play with a new lineup today. Xinsheng has young and skilled players with ample stamina.</p>
<p>In the second game, Indian will face Dahua. The former is a youth organization of Western expatriates, strengthened by veterans Lu Dazhen and Lu Zhongen, making their strength even more formidable. However, they lack practice and coordination. The final game will be between Marines and Qingbai. The Marines are a well-known U.S. Navy championship team from Qingdao and have represented the Qingdao U.S. Navy in the Pacific Zone Basketball Championship. Topika Ma, who is famous in Qingdao, was also defeated by them. The entire team is tall and strong, with outstanding individual skills and novel tactics, making them formidable opponents in Shanghai's basketball scene. This visit to Shanghai is for a friendship and goodwill tour. There will definitely be a wonderful performance at that time. The full roster will be announced when they take the court that night. Qingbai is a new team this year, with talented players such as national team members Wang Nanzhen, Cai Yanxiong, Zhang Shaoqing, Chen Xianglong, and Wang Junbing. Their basketball skills have improved rapidly. Tonight, they will face the visiting team, taking the lead in the game. They will definitely fight with all their might, and there will be many intense and exciting moments.</p>

<h3>World Games Broadcast in Forty-Six Languages</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] When the World Games are held here this summer, the proceedings will be reported to the world in forty-six languages by two hundred sports critics and broadcasters. Half of the broadcasters will be foreigners, and the rest will be British broadcasters. Wembley Stadium is the main competition venue. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) plans to set up thirty-two broadcasting stations inside the stadium. The main competitions include track and field, swimming, boxing, hockey, gymnastics, soccer, and equestrian events. Other competitions will be held at various sports venues from London to Torquay. Rowing competitions will be held in South Devon, where one hundred and twenty broadcasting stations will be set up. Four American broadcasting companies are in contact with the BBC to relay broadcasts. The BBC also has electronic tax broadcasting equipment.</p>
<h3>Open Badminton Tournament</h3>
<p>In the open badminton tournament last night, another upset occurred in the preliminary singles, with newcomer Chen Bingwen eliminating Su Mingren. After three fierce games, Su initially held a 13-0 lead, but relaxed slightly. Unexpectedly, Chen Bingwen picked up momentum from there, playing better and better. Although he lost the first game, he was able to win the next two and secure the final victory. Although Su tried power shots and light drops, he could not win. Only one doubles match was played. The Hong Dequan and Hou Shuji team won without a fight. Li Guofan and Bo Siji defeated the Hua brothers without much effort. The He Chuanlong and Jin Yuanlin team had their match postponed to tomorrow due to Jin's illness.</p>
<p>Wu Chonggong formally notified the committee twice that his partner Lin Baohua was no longer in Shanghai and would be replaced by Yang Jingling, which was approved. Also, Gu Jvntao will go to Hangzhou on Wednesday, and his partner Wu Xiaoheng has gone to Beijing, so the Gu-Wu team has withdrawn.

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Stops Selling Rice in Markets, Resumes Free Trade; Market Sentiment Weakens, White Rice Drops by 200,000 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The rice market resumed free trade yesterday. The authorities stopped selling rice in the market [because the government began to implement full rice rationing and prices in producing areas fell, etc.]. Market sentiment was weak, and most people remained on the sidelines, causing prices to fall by 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, 1,300 shi (a unit of dry volume) were registered as arriving in Nanshi, and 1,350 shi and five斗 in Beishi. Market prices: Special high-quality japonica rice was 2,900,000 yuan, white japonica rice was 2,800,000 yuan, thin indica rice was 2,850,000 yuan in Nanshi and 2,830,000 yuan in Beishi. Early indica rice was 2,750,000 yuan in Nanshi and 2,720,000 yuan in Beishi. Yangxian rice was 2,850,000 yuan in Nanshi and 2,800,000 yuan in Beishi. Milled indica rice was 2,650,000 yuan in Nanshi and 2,680,000 yuan in Beishi. Baiyuan rice was 2,900,000 yuan in Nanshi and 2,800,000 yuan in Beishi. Yinyuan rice was 2,800,000 yuan in Nanshi and 2,750,000 yuan in Beishi.</p>
<p>Flour Hits Limit Down</p>
<p>With tin prices plummeting and rice prices falling sharply, all brands of flour opened this morning at the limit down price and still lacked buyers. Outside the market, Bingchuan flour was as low as 1,230,000 yuan, and Hongfeng and Jiancheng flour were both at 1,200,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Wheat bran also fell to 750,000 yuan at the opening.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains Plunge</p>
<p>Amid the rice market downturn, soybeans were the first to suffer. Hubei soybeans from Hankou remained sluggish and difficult to sell, falling by more than 15%. The decline in local soybeans was slower, with special coarse soybeans from Pinghu falling by 50,000 yuan, and Pudong soybeans also falling by 200,000 yuan. Tianjin sesame was stable, but sales in the local market were sluggish, with sesame from Jiujiang declining slightly by 200,000 yuan. Dongqing declined by more than 300,000 yuan, and the decline in high-quality corn was slower, with corn from Qidong falling by 150,000 yuan. Medium-quality corn plunged by 200,000 to 250,000 yuan. Mung beans declined, raw peanuts lacked buyers, and red sorghum was not being traded.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Declines</p>
<p>Although producing areas were not reporting small, tight credit conditions in Shanghai and the falling rice market forced sellers to liquidate and seek cash. Jiton brand peanut oil opened at 6,500,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 600,000 yuan. Local factory soybean oil was offered for sale by the factory at 5,700,000 yuan, with buyback orders at 5,600,000 yuan, a discount of more than 500,000 yuan compared to the previous market. Peanut oil, sesame oil, and Jiton small-cart oil each fell by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and soybean cake sales turned sluggish.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The American President Lines company, agent for the "Amerel La Grosse," is bringing over 61,700 bags of foreign rice from the United States, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai this week. Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu vessel left for Rangoon yesterday morning, specially to load 9,000 tons of rice to Shanghai. The vessel loaded 1,200 bales of spun cloth from this city for that port of transport and is reported to be going to Kaohsiung to load 3,000 tons of sugar for transport to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Hua Stocks Recover Strongly After Early Weakness, Most Rise at Close</h3>
<p>Hua stocks recovered strongly yesterday after early weakness. Tense credit conditions also eased. Banking firms numbered 168 and 232 selectively acquired American, Asian, and real estate stocks for investment purposes, showing notable activity. The overall trend suggested a slight recovery.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, unease prevailed in the market, and credit remained tight. Even news reports of a temporary delay in U.S. aid discussions had no impact, and stocks generally opened lower. Wing On Textiles debuted at prices of 990 yuan and 1030 yuan. After opening, firms such as 188 bought in, raising the prices to highs of 1003 yuan and 1035 yuan. Firms such as 89 settled for immediate delivery, while firms such as 16 sold and delivered later, pushing prices down to 965 yuan and 993 yuan.

Off-market interest rates remained unchanged, and stringent enforcement persisted. External market stimulus decreased, and firms such as 219 settled for immediate delivery. Firms such as 141 offered later deliveries again. Except for limited transactions in China Land, which uniquely reached the upper limit, other stocks turned downwards. King Lun even reached the lower limit. Firms such as 76 took advantage of low prices to maintain later deliveries, and firm 36 purchased for immediate delivery. By midday, Wing On Textiles had risen to 958 yuan and 989 yuan. The final result was that, compared to last Saturday, King Lun shares, after hitting the lower limit for immediate delivery, recovered somewhat, with the fall reduced by half. Lai On, China Silk, King Fook, China Products, and Commercial Press fell by about 10%. Wing On Textiles, American Asian, Sino British, China Flourishing, New Light, Jia Fa, New China Matches, Wing Kung Underwear, Yung Foong, and Great Union fell by half a percent.

Firms such as 146 bought for later delivery, and firms such as 71 bought for immediate delivery. The National Bank's intervention was limited. American Asian suddenly became popular, and Wing On Real Estate and United China Real Estate stocks rose to the upper limit. Near the close, counter-movements showed strength, with Wing On Textiles rising to highs of 1025 yuan and 1036 yuan before closing at 1025 yuan and 1035 yuan.

Other stocks had mixed fortunes.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Decline Slightly; Foreign Stocks Weaken</h3>
<p>Government bonds were forced down slightly yesterday by the environment. Multiple factors were stifled by tight credit. Unified C bonds fell from 97,000 to a low of 85,000 before stabilizing slightly. Room 552 bought in, while Room 503 sold first and then bought in.

<h3>Sugar Market Continues to Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended weakly, with most areas softening. The First Association's assessment: Spot No. 24 coarse white sugar was CN$3.65 million, down CN$50,000. Four-and-a-half white sugar was initially weak but then tightened, at CN$3.70 million to CN$3.85 million, with little fluctuation. No. 20 medium sand white was CN$3.15 million to CN$3.21 million, Taiwanese red sugar was CN$3.15 million to CN$3.16 million, down CN$40,000 to CN$50,000.</p>

<h3>Tea Market Lingers at Original Levels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchant tea market remained calm due to weak activity from exporters. As for domestic sales, buyers from the local street and areas such as Soochow and Wuxi continued to purchase steadily, resulting in strong demand, and transactions remained consistent. However, the trend remained at the original level, without significant changes from last week. Although sellers intended to raise prices, there was a continued lack of stimulating news to boost confidence, making it difficult to improve the situation. However, according to general observation, with low inventory levels for all goods, there seemed to be no downward trend expected.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Applying to Purchase Compensatory Machinery at Fixed Price to Be Extended</h3>
<p>According to Gu Baochang, Director of the Industrial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, only five private factories have applied to purchase Japanese compensatory machinery according to the fixed-price list to date, while more than fifty have applied to purchase without following the list. It is expected that the number will increase soon. The original deadline for applications, March 15th, will be extended until the machinery is sold out. The valuation of this batch of machinery has been handled by an evaluation committee, which will be established soon. The valuation standards will strive for fairness. Although this batch of machinery is already 40% cheaper than new machinery according to the Allied headquarters' assessed value, due to the hasty acceptance and inspection by our personnel, there may have been omissions, so it has been decided to further reduce the price. The applications for purchase will be compiled and reviewed by mid-next month.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] It was reported that Northeast circulation currency would be used at a fixed rate with legal tender in Guan Nei (within the Great Wall).</p>
<h3>Northeast Circulation Currency Not Used in Guan Nei</h3>
<p>Regarding the report that Northeast circulation currency will be used at a fixed rate with legal tender in Guan Nei, President Zhang of the National Bank of China stated yesterday morning that it is completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>In addition, a senior official of the Central Bank confirmed that the Shanhaiguan branch continues to exchange circulation currency. All individuals entering Guan must exchange circulation currency for legal tender before entering.</p>
<h3>Buyers Watching and Waiting; Cotton Yarn Supply Exceeds Demand; Prices of All Counts of Coarse and Fine Yarn Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn and cloth market was characterized by tight credit among industry players, leading to a sense of unease. Bulls frequently sold off, dominating the market, while buyers watched and waited, resulting in supply exceeding demand and prices falling sharply. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened at CN$108 million, but there were few takers. The last transaction was at CN$102 million, a drop of CN$20 million compared to the weekend. Spot and warehouse receipts for all other counts of coarse and fine yarn also experienced significant drops, ranging from CN$3 million to CN$8 million.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] China Textile Construction Company opened ten types of yarn yesterday, as usual, selling a total of 860 pieces, equivalent to 1200 pieces of 20-count yarn. The opening price for 20-count yarn was CN$57 million.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market was characterized by strict inspections of warehouses and cloth dealers' accounts by yarn authorities, leading to unease. Furthermore, the sudden tightening of credit in the market caused transactions to stagnate. Only a few buyers from Hankou made sporadic purchases. The market was dominated by selling, and prices fell sharply. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at CN$2.60 million but fell all the way down to CN$2.42 million at the close, a sharp drop of CN$280,000 compared to Saturday. Other grades of fine cloth, serge, direct tribute cloth, and twill also fell sharply, ranging from CN$100,000 to CN$250,000, except for the stable local market for Swiss cotton.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Continue to Surge</h3>
<p>The prices of woolen fabrics and serge have been surging daily, reaching unprecedented levels, with a total increase of more than 50% in the past week. The reasons for this sharp increase are mostly due to rumors and speculation. The soaring prices of rice and other commodities, as well as the increase in the cost of living, have also had a significant impact. Currently, retail transactions are being forced to halt one after another.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Plunge; Factory Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>The rayon market continued to decline yesterday. As those who ordered rayon with foreign exchange were required to pay customs duties today, demand suddenly stalled. 120's Asahi brand glossy rayon opened in the morning at around CN$38 million. The lowest price was CN$25 million for immediate payment, and the midday price recovered to CN$29.5 million for next-day delivery. The afternoon saw a slight rebound, with the final selling price at CN$31 million. However, this was still CN$12 million lower than last Saturday.</p>
<p>Factory transactions were quiet yesterday due to the sudden tightening of credit and the decline in rayon prices, leading to a wait-and-see approach. Prices for all grades were CN$4 million to CN$5 million lower than last Saturday. High-grade 00 was offered at CN$55 million for immediate payment, with no transactions. Mid-grade rayon also lacked transactions, and prices were CN$2 million to CN$3 million lower.</p>
<h3>The Rebirth and Support of Taiwanese Coal</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>(3) Implementation of Loans: The loans currently offered by the association include two types: coal storage loans and production increase loans. Coal storage loans are provided to coalfields and railway stations to ensure that operators can continue production without financial difficulties. These loans are deducted from the purchase price, ensuring that producers have sufficient working capital to use without having to wait until delivery to receive payment. The total amount of these loans currently amounts to 1.2 to 1.3 billion CN$, approximately 120 to 130 billion legal tender, which provides considerable assistance to operators. Production increase loans are used to assist operators in expanding equipment, improving engineering, or developing new pits. These loans have been agreed upon with the Taiwan Bank, and will be offered at low interest rates starting this year. All those that are truly for production increase purposes can obtain this benefit. In addition, there are subsidies for new pit development, deep inclined pit subsidies, and long-distance coal transport subsidies, all of which are handled jointly by the association and the Department of Construction. The association also pays close attention to the welfare of miners. It has agreed with the Coal Industry Association to allocate 15% of the export surplus to miners' welfare funds, which are distributed and paid by the association. The association has also obtained approval from the Food Bureau to allocate low-priced rice, with all mining employees receiving 30 catties of low-priced rice per month. It is said that employees in other industries have not yet received this benefit. This is also a measure implemented by the association to stimulate production.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the rebirth of Taiwanese coal is not accidental, but rather the price paid by the joint efforts of all parties. (End)</p>
<h3>Last Month, Coal Transported to Shanghai Increased; Allocation Price Increased by 35%; Retail Price of Coal Balls CN$450,000 per Load</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the Fuel Control Committee, the total amount of coal transported to Shanghai from various places in February reached over 130,000 tons, including approximately 60,000 tons transported from Qinhuangdao, 9,600 tons transported from Tanggu, over 40,000 tons of Taiwanese coal, and 15,000 tons of East China coal, exceeding the total amount of coal transported to Shanghai in January by more than threefold.</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation price for this month, Minister Chen decided when he was in Shanghai to temporarily allow an increase of 30% to reduce the burden on public utilities and production industries. However, coal merchants from various places stated that the prices of flour and the cost of living have increased significantly recently, and that a 30% increase would not cover costs, requesting a change to an increase of approximately 60%.</p>
<p>It is understood that Minister Chen telegraphed the association at 3 pm yesterday, instructing an increase of 35%. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately invited representatives from various factories in Shanghai, including Kailuan and East China Huainan, to a meeting to explain the situation.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Fuel Group of the Shanghai Municipal Price Appraisal Council held its 20th appraisal meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs at 3 pm yesterday, deciding to adjust the price of machine-made coal balls to CN$7.8 million per ton at the factory, plus CN$120,000 for delivery. The retail price will be CN$450,000 per load, pending approval by Committee Member Wu Zhongren before implementation.</p>
<h3>Fuel Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coal market was characterized by scarcity and low inventory, leading to repeated price increases. Jiaozuo white coal chunks rose sharply by CN$1 million per ton, to CN$13 million. Furong white coal was CN$7.8 million, Pingxiang bituminous coal was sold at CN$11 million, Datong was CN$12 million, Xuzhou coke was CN$8 million, and various other types of bituminous and white coal, as well as coal dust, also showed strength, continuing to rise by approximately 10% compared to Saturday.</p>
<p>The factory price of coal balls rose to CN$7.92 million per ton, and the retail price was CN$450,000 per load, an increase of 50% compared to the previous price.</p>
<p>The firewood and charcoal market was characterized by scarcity and brisk sales, leading to higher prices. Chestnut firewood rose to CN$200,000 per load, pine firewood was CN$171,000, green charcoal was CN$770,000 per load, and white charcoal was CN$610,000, also an increase of approximately 20%.</p>

<p>Learning Trends</p>
<h3>On the Totality of Scholarship</h3>
<p>— Hong Qian</p>
<p>In the seventh issue of this publication, Mr. Yan Qun, in his article "From Concrete to Abstract," divides learning into two aspects: knowledge and action. "The learning of the knowledge aspect is modern pure natural science, and the learning of the action aspect is modern applied science." The subject of this article is to discuss the relationship between these two aspects of learning: Are they separate or a whole? Are they independent or a totality?</p>
<p>In the minds of most people, these two aspects of learning have fundamental differences, even opposition. The learning of the knowledge aspect focuses on theoretical research and exploration, aiming to establish a theoretical system or network for practical problems. The learning of the action aspect emphasizes "universal and economically practical application" in society, aiming for influence and impact on practical life. But is this a correct view of the relationship between the knowledge and action aspects of learning?</p>
<p>In my opinion, not only are pure natural science and applied science not independent or separable, but also the entire field of "learning" that emphasizes theoretical system research, such as philosophy, literature, history, cultural science, natural science, etc., and the entire field of "skill" that emphasizes social application, such as the application of theoretical research conclusions of all social sciences other than applied science in practice (such as "economic regulation" and business administration in economic science, and "population control" and "administrative organization" in political science), are all a complete totality. Please allow me to explain in detail:</p>
<p>The main reason why most people believe that scholarship lacks totality and completeness lies in the difference in "practical use" for society between the various branches of "learning" and the various branches of "skill." Such differences are not only easy to see within the scope of scholarship and technology, but also obvious within the same academic field. Don't we often hear that those who study the liberal arts are not as useful as those who study science? For example, those who study physics can always connect wires or install wireless electricity, and those who study biology can always identify poisonous pests. But not everyone who studies literature can carve seals or write antithetical couplets. The interest of the general public in philosophy is far less than that of fortune tellers and diviners in the neighborhood. However, those who study engineering are more useful than those who study science. Not only do they, like those who study science, have a superficial understanding and application of certain technological and industrial objects, but after they graduate, they can simply create many strange and wonderful things to solve problems related to clothing, food, housing, transportation, and other aspects of social life. For example, railways, steamships, automobiles, airplanes, sewing machines, telegraphs, telephones, electric lights, etc... There is simply no end to such examples.</p>
<p>This is how we see such a gap and such differences in "usefulness" between "learning" and "skill." However, when we look at the relationship between "learning" and "skill" from a principled or theoretical perspective, it is different. Why is science learning more useful than liberal arts learning in practice? Why is engineering learning more useful than science learning? From a principled or theoretical point of view, it is because the various objects of study in the liberal arts, science, and engineering can harmoniously assist each other, interact with each other, cooperate within the scope of the totality of scholarship, run in parallel without contradiction, and reach the same goal by different paths. For example, let's talk about "learning" located at the very top of all "learning" – that is, philosophy. Philosophy is the origin of European science, and science evolved from philosophy. The natural philosophy of the Greek era included both philosophy and science. The philosophers of that time were also the scientists of that time. The idealist philosopher Plato was a geometrician, and the materialist Democritus was the founder of atomism and also a scientist. Aristotle was naturally a great scientist in the early days of European science, and his view of natural science was followed until the Renaissance. The same is true of modern philosophy. Descartes was the discoverer of analytic geometry, Spinoza was an optician, and Leibniz was the discoverer of calculus at the same time as Newton. The great philosopher Kant was also a great scientist, and his nebular hypothesis can simply be compared with that of Laplace. Modern philosophers such as Lu Zhuo Feixile and Mach were either physicians, physiologists, or physicists. Contemporary philosophers such as Russell, Whitehead, Schlick, Carnap, and Weissmann were either mathematicians or physicists. The writings of the contemporary great scientist Einstein on philosophy are no less than those on pure science. In short, we have never seen any emphasis on one over the other in the liberal arts and sciences that has led to development in either. Nor have we seen a division of emphasis in the liberal arts and sciences that has led to their development. The facts are there, how can there be any doubt?</p>
<p>Having gained the above understanding about the impossibility of separating or isolating "learning" in the liberal arts and sciences, and the impossibility of judging them from the perspective of "usefulness," we can understand the significance of the totality of scholarship. However, if we turn our attention to the relationship between science and engineering, this point becomes even clearer and more thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>So-called engineering learning, or applied science, is actually the application of the principles of natural science in various practical aspects. For example, psychology and biology in medicine, physics and chemistry in pharmacy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry in industrial science, chemistry, biology, soil science, and meteorology in agriculture, and astronomy and oceanography in aeronautics and navigation. As for the utility of scientific methods in craftsmanship, there are metallurgical methods for extracting gold from gold minerals, the technical development of rubber materials and their derivatives, the electrochemical industry, and the improvement of steelmaking methods. In addition, many substances, such as indigo, were previously extracted from natural products, but are now manufactured using synthetic methods. There is also the use of inert gas in the air to make fertilizer, all of which can be used to prove this. Professor Wallace, in his book "The Wonderful Century," compared the practical applications of science in the centuries before the nineteenth century, and at the same time identified thirteen important inventions of the nineteenth century: railways, steamships, telegraphs, telephones, safety matches, gas lights, electric lights, photography, phonographs, X-rays, spectroscopic analysis, anesthetics, and antiseptics. In contrast, there were only seven in the previous centuries: telescopes, printing presses, compasses, Arabic numerals, alphabetic writing, steam engines, and barometers. Although Wallace's comparison of thirteen inventions in one century versus seven in previous centuries is too respectful of the nineteenth century and undervalues previous centuries, it can prove how the progress of science in a certain century is related to the actual inventions of that century. They are inseparable, like form and shadow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over the years, those who advocate "learning for application" have often overlooked the relationship between applied science and natural science, and believe that engineering learning has the possibility of independent development. They do not realize that engineering learning, as an applied science, cannot be applied without scientific theory as its basis and scientific methods as its aid, and it fundamentally loses its significance as an applied science. The discovery of conic sections by the Greeks was certainly not for practical use, but when we talk about the curves of bridges or bullets, or about navigation, we must think of this law of conic sections. A part of navigation is based on astronomy, and astronomy is based on Kepler's laws. But the central point of Kepler's laws is only that he was able to use deductive methods to infer from conic sections that the sun revolves in an elliptical orbit with the sun as the intersection point. Therefore, the astronomer Laplace once said: "If the Greeks had not discovered the tangent lines formed by the intersection of conical bodies, this accurate astronomical law would not have arisen." The steam power, telegraph, telephone, and power engines that are generally considered sufficient to change life all come from theoretical research in heat, electricity, and optics. Who knows that Thomson's mathematical analysis of the electrical vibration theory already has the foundation of wireless electricity. Galvani's research on frog leg spasms and Smith's exploration of English strata both came from theoretical curiosity. Although we know that one can be used to guide the development of telegraphs, and the other has a great effect on the exploitation of British mining, what are the actual effects? The method of spectroscopic analysis also comes from theoretical observation. Who knows that it can be used to discover that coal tar contains many mixtures, all of which are clear evidence of those who started without "practical use" and ended up with "practical use."</p>
<p>In summary, we can understand that "learning" and "skill" are fundamentally inseparable and independent, and that they are a complete totality. They are different expressions of academic research and essential contents of human cultural life. Therefore, countries and nations with truly developed scholarship all have special creations and inventions in both "learning" and "skill." Social environments with truly cultural lives also have spiritual traditions and practical skills in both "learning" and "skill." In the past, our country did not understand the totality of scholarship, so there was a time when we valued liberal arts learning and undervalued science and engineering learning, and at another time we did just the opposite. As a result, the promotion of either "learning" or "skill" over the past few decades has been deplorably poor. Therefore, a proper understanding and awareness of the totality of scholarship is a pressing need today.</p>
<h3>Comparing the Intelligence of Urban and Rural Residents After Bombings</h3>
<p>— Fangzheng</p>
<p>The simple-mindedness of country folk has often been the source of jokes among city dwellers. Are rural people truly less intelligent than city people? In terms of achievement, there seems to be no doubt. In China, Pan Guangdan and Fei Xiaotong's statistics on the imperial examinations have already proven the superiority of urban dwellers. In the United States, psychologist J. McK. Cattell, in his "American Men of Science," compiled statistics on 866 scientists born in the U.S. Of these, 224 came from cities with populations of 25,000 or more in 1900. The total population of these cities was only one-sixth of the rural population, yet they produced over one-third of the scientists, clearly indicating that cities offer conditions more conducive to producing great scientists. But are these conditions artificial or innate? Cattell himself leaned towards the environmental explanation, attributing the differences in achievement between urban and rural populations to "population density, wealth, opportunity, social atmosphere, and ideals." We will discuss the reasons for this view below.</p>
<p>Since the rise of intelligence testing, there has been much research on the differences in innate abilities between urban and rural residents. Let us take the investigation by W.F. Book as an example:</p>
<p>Up to the age of fourteen, urban children consistently scored higher on average than rural children, with only 24% of rural children able to catch up with the average urban child. This seems to confirm the common belief that urban children are inherently more intelligent. After the age of fourteen or fifteen, rural children seem to catch up with and even surpass urban children. However, this apparent improvement is merely an illusion. The reason is that in rural America, most children no longer attend school after the age of fourteen or fifteen. Those who remain in school are the more intelligent ones, and the tests are conducted in schools. This selection effect makes it seem statistically that rural children outperform urban children. Therefore, the results of intelligence tests generally indicate that urban areas are superior to rural areas.</p>
<p>In Scotland, G.H. Thomson led an even more precise comparative study. He found not only that rural children had lower intelligence than urban children, but also that intelligence increased the closer one lived to the city and decreased the farther away one lived. (Of course, all of this refers to averages.) This degree of difference further supports the "Blood seeks environment" theory, which is widely accepted. In other words, the difference in intelligence between urban and rural residents is not caused by the environment but because the talented individuals in rural areas migrate to the cities, leaving behind those with lower abilities. This kind of selection is strongly advocated by proponents of heredity, and people like Pan Guangdan and Fei Xiaotong in China seem to have similar leanings. However, sociologists and social psychologists have recently presented strong counter-evidence. For example, Professor O. Klineberg of Columbia University, in his book "Race Differences," conducted studies on Black people that are difficult to explain in the same way.</p>
<p>Years of Black People Residing in Cities and Intelligence Chart</p>
<p>Intelligence is directly proportional to the number of years spent living in cities, which makes one question the theory of innate intelligence and believe that the urban and rural environments are the cause of differences in intelligence. Cities have convenient transportation, frequent social stimulation, higher cultural standards, and more educational opportunities, all of which can give an individual an intellectual advantage. Because cities offer better opportunities for cultured individuals, the public is also more enthusiastic about education, and everyone aspires to intellectual development. All of this demonstrates the stimulating effect of the urban environment on intelligence. But there is another important reason that past psychologists have overlooked: the materials used in intelligence tests are all taken from urban contexts, and some perspectives can only be understood by urban children. For example, one sentence-building test in intelligence tests is as follows:</p>
<p>Up Down I Village Go Early</p>
<p>The answer to this test is naturally "I go to the village early in the morning." But this tone is completely the tone of an urban child, something a rural child would never think of. Because the experience of rural children is only "I go to the city early in the morning" or "I go to the street early in the morning." It is not surprising that rural children fail in this type of intelligence test. If we were to choose living materials from rural children, using things commonly seen in the countryside to create the tests, the result might be that rural children have higher intelligence than urban children. In this way, we can no longer confidently say that the intelligence of rural children is inherently inferior to that of urban children. Different environments may be a more fundamental reason.</p>

<h3>What is Immortality</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yu</p>
<p>"Immortality" or "non-death" is what everyone hopes for deep down, if it is possible. But what is immortality? Or what is the meaning of immortality? There are different answers to this question. Westerners have their answers, and Chinese people have their answers.</p>
<p>The Western answer is that immortality is the immortality of the soul. Only the soul has the possibility of immortality. This theory of the immortality of the soul has been advocated by the majority of people, from ancient Greek philosophers to modern Christian theologians. This is a major issue in Western metaphysics, which traditional philosophers must explain.</p>
<p>The Chinese answer is that immortality is the continuation of the life of descendants. The question of immortality is the question of whether or not there are descendants. If we have sons and grandsons, our life is entrusted to the life of our descendants, and it continues through the continuation of the life of our descendants. Descendants have descendants, and the life of descendants is infinite, so my life is also infinite. Therefore, Chinese people seek to have sons who can support themselves and carry on their ambitions and inherit their family business. The purpose is to solve one's own immortality problem. If descendants are similar to oneself in both body and spirit, isn't it that oneself has a second or third generation of life? Mencius's saying that "there are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest" emphasizes "having no descendants," perhaps for this reason.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two answers, there is also a third and fourth answer. These two answers seek immortality from the "effects" of life. Everything has an effect, and life must also have an effect. However, the effects of life can be divided into spiritual and material. In terms of the spiritual effects of life, this influence can be immortal. The so-called immortality of spiritual influence is the three immortalities of "establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words" in ancient China. These three immortalities are created by the spiritual activities of life and are unique to a few outstanding individuals, not everyone can have them. Although everyone must speak and act, not everyone's words and deeds can be immortal, that is, not everyone can make future generations be influenced by them and worship or commemorate them. Therefore, those who are able to be worshiped or commemorated by people today have obtained this kind of immortality. This is the most precious immortality.</p>
<p>In terms of the material effects of life, this influence is definitely immortal. The so-called immortality of material influence is caused by the fact that life is a kind of material activity. Once there is life, there is this fact, and this fact must have some influence on future facts. This is to say that any activity of a piece of matter must make the arrangement of atoms and electrons around it different, and this difference must make the arrangement of all atoms and electrons in the future still have some subtle differences. Therefore, as long as the universe exists for one day, this material influence will also exist for one day. This can be said to be the most lasting but also the most meaningless immortality.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of what immortality is, four answers have been proposed above: one is the immortality of the soul, the second is the immortality of having descendants, the third is the immortality of spiritual influence, and the fourth is the immortality of material influence. The first kind of immortality depends on whether there is a soul, and this is a question. The second kind of immortality may not be very reliable, because one does not have complete certainty about whether there will be descendants. The third kind of immortality is hopeful and requires effort. As for the fourth kind of immortality, it is effortless, the most reliable, but absolutely worthless. Therefore, if we want to pursue immortality, what we should pursue is the second and third kinds of immortality.</p>
<h3>Random Talks from the Academic World (11)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>National Construction Spirit and the Gan-Zhe Railway</p>
<p>Everyone is talking about national construction now, but national construction values practice over empty talk. Throughout my life, I have admired two Mr. Zhangs: one is Mr. Zhang Jian, who founded industries in Nantong, and the other is Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, who founded the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (originally named the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway). I once wrote an ode to Zhang of Nantong, which I will transcribe below.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong lives in seclusion in Nantong, 'plowing in the fields of idleness, fishing on the shores of loneliness.' If bureaucrats and politicians were placed here, they would be unable to bear their worries, but Mr. Zhang is in a time of vigorous activity. Mr. Zhang believes that local autonomy must seek a foundation, and the best way to lay the foundation is to focus on land. In the twenty-seventh year of the Guangxu reign, Mr. Zhang started the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company. People at the time praised his reclamation, turning barren land into fertile soil, worthy of competing with Duke Fan. The Fan Gong Dike in Jiangbei was built by Fan Zhongyan of the Song Dynasty, also known as the Sea Defense Dike, used to defend against the tides. It stretches through the counties of Ningyang, Yancheng, Dongtai, and Nantong, a total length of more than four hundred li. The dike site still exists today. After the Song Dynasty, the coastline rose, and the Fan Dike was one or two hundred li from the sea at its widest point and several tens of li at its narrowest. The land was barren and lacked dikes to defend against the tides, resulting in a desolate beach where no grass grew. At the beginning of his work, Mr. Zhang opened canals and rivers to facilitate irrigation, built dikes to prevent tidal disasters, and cultivated barren land that was difficult to plow, first planting light green seeds to transform the soil. In areas where thatch had already grown and the barren land had nearly exhausted its vitality, he recruited tenants to cultivate the land and plant cotton according to the suitability of the soil. In the thirty-first year of the Guangxu reign, a great storm surge occurred. Mr. Zhang personally inspected the sea and said, 'Do not be afraid! We will fight the storm surge with the blood and sweat of those who work and the shoulders of the scholars.' He also said that we must not be impatient, ten years to roughly define the scale, five more years to prepare the scale, and five more years to achieve the effect." Mr. Zhang's ambition was to reclaim 15 million mu of land, with each person occupying 20 mu, capable of accommodating 750,000 people. Although Mr. Zhang's plan has not yet been fully realized, from Nantong to Fuyu, large and small, there are no fewer than twenty new construction salt reclamation companies, and no fewer than tens of thousands of reclamation workers. The new villages and towns organized by the various companies are mostly densely populated, but because they have been established for a short time, many places are not yet recorded. 'Within each dike, there are houses for people to live in, rooms to entertain guests, warehouses to store goods, gardens to grow vegetables, huts for tenants, markets for merchants, and roads for travelers, like a small world.' People praised him, saying, 'Outside Fan Gong Dike, Zhang Gong reclaims land, filling the stomachs of ten thousand families.' Mr. Zhang's actions can make the world know that the Chinese are not entirely ignorant of agricultural reclamation plans."</p>
<p>"I once said, what is the difference between a politician of the new era and an old-style official? I believe that the old-style officials only focus on the relationship between people, while the politicians of the new era should focus on the relationship between people and nature. New-style politicians also talk about ingratiating themselves, but they do not ingratiate themselves with superiors and colleagues. What they want to ingratiate themselves with is the heavens above and the advantages of the land below. New-style politicians also talk about running around, but they are unwilling to run around to the doors of wealthy officials. What they are willing to run around to are rivers, mountains, and the vast wilderness, wanting to jointly plan the development of natural resources with the people, for the benefit of the country and the people. Based on this, I must consider Zhang Jian of Nantong to be the foremost practical politician of modern China." (Feelings of Eastern and Western Changes, Era Public Opinion, tenth issue, June 10, twenty-first year)</p>
<p>The Founding Father of the Republic, Sun Yat-sen, called the county the true foundation for building China. Zhang of Nantong's undertakings are indeed the foundation for national construction. The Founding Father also said that revitalizing industry should first prioritize transportation, and planning transportation should first prioritize railways. One latitude and one longitude, in terms of region, with counties as the basis, in terms of undertakings, with railways as the vanguard, this is the most profound saying for national construction. Among the many railway trunk lines in China in the past, the one that best embodies the spirit of national construction is the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, personally created by Mr. Zhang Jingjiang. Now, as the road holds the opening ceremony for the rebuilt Hangzhou-Nanyu section, I must say a few words in commemoration.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the spirit of hard work, quick action, practical action, far-sighted plans, and the ability to see the big picture and start from the small details, so that success can be achieved step by step. Now, our country is in a time of internal and external troubles, and the environment is extremely difficult, but construction is necessary to save the crisis. And current construction, without a spirit of hard work, will inevitably lead to complete helplessness, so the past experience of building the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is extremely valuable at the moment. The first section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, from Hangzhou to Jiangshan, called the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, was proposed by Mr. Zhang Jingjiang when he was the chairman of Zhejiang Province in the nineteenth year of the Republic. The construction of this road in March of the nineteenth year had only 200,000 yuan in construction funds. By July, it had reached Zhuji, and the difficult situation can be imagined. Mr. Zhang devoted his energies and devised a unique approach, laying thirty-five-pound light rails, aiming to save initial construction costs, but still not hindering future expansion and development. The average cost of engineering and equipment per kilometer of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was only 36,000 yuan, which was much cheaper than the cost of more than 90,000 yuan per kilometer for other state-owned roads. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was also extended westward from Jiangshan to Yushan in Jiangxi, called the Hangzhou-Yushan section, which was entirely built by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The route west of Yushan was jointly operated by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provinces. The term Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway began in the spring of the twenty-third year of the Republic. The Yushan to Nanchang section, 290 kilometers long, took one and a half years and was opened to traffic on January 15 of the twenty-fifth year, costing 18 million yuan. This section was rebuilt with sixty-three-pound heavy rails, so the cost was higher, averaging about 60,000 yuan per kilometer, which was not too much.</p>
<p>In the past, China's major projects mostly relied on foreigners. The construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and later the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway did not rely on foreign assistance or foreign capital. Chinese engineers did their own design. Except for steel rails, vehicles, machinery, and bridge materials, which could not be produced domestically and had to be ordered from abroad, domestic goods were used as much as possible within the possible range to reduce leakage. Although steel beam materials were not from Germany, they were distributed to domestic factories for contracting. Later, the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge still followed this consistent spirit, greatly strengthening the confidence of building the country independently. At that time, the government had financial difficulties and could not invest in railways, but the banking industry, which had available capital, was interested in investing due to the construction of the road. The road was also able to maintain its credit for foreign debt, so it was able to continue borrowing and expanding westward. The source of funds for the road was due to the cooperation and support of the domestic financial community. According to the report for the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, the entire road from Hangzhou to Nanchang, 660 kilometers, had a total of 4,000 employees, which was more streamlined than other roads. Senior leaders were able to work hard and self-discipline, serving as role models for all employees, and their service spirit was praised by the people at the time.</p>
<p>The construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was still during the period of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi. In addition to the banditry, it was also affected by floods and plagues. When the Nanchang-Yushan section started construction, the remnants of bandits in northeastern Jiangxi had not been cleared and often caused disturbances, even killing employees of the road and contractors, so the progress of the project was often hindered. Later, we contacted the local garrison for protection and built twenty-eight blockhouses along the road, stationing troops to guard them, so that the project could continue. At the same time, the peasants in this section had suffered from banditry and had also suffered from disasters, and were displaced and had no way to make a living. After consultation with the authorities, we did our best to organize work relief to help them. In total, about 2,000 people died from water, bandits, and plagues during the construction of the Nanyu section. Relying on clever strategies and the collective efforts, not avoiding difficulties and dangers, it was completed, which is also commendable.</p>
<p>The business policy of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is to promote domestic goods, in order to support the mission of revitalizing the domestic industry. Therefore, business offices were set up at important stations to facilitate the promotion of products from Shanghai-Hangzhou domestic goods factories, and transportation costs were drastically reduced in order to reduce costs, so as to compete with imported goods. As for the important specialties of various places along the line, Zhejiang-Jiangxi specialty exhibitions were held to promote them, and transportation and marketing cooperatives were organized at various stations along the line to collect transportation fees, concentrate goods, and set low, simple, and rational transportation prices and combined transportation methods for railways, highways, and waterways, in order to increase railway business and assist in the revitalization of the local economy. Railways are a tool, and their purpose is to improve people's livelihood and prosper the local economy. For the specialties of various places along the line, we should find ways to increase their production, improve their quality, and expand their market. Railways are not only a medium for developing inter-provincial trade, but also rely on the export of specialties for foreign trade, so railways should pay more attention to international trade. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau was able to pay attention to this point at the beginning of its establishment, which is a very correct policy. Systematic investigation of the economic geography along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, precise estimation of industrial location, and multi-faceted support for various production enterprises, of course, still await continued efforts in the future.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has a short history, and has been through wars and many obstacles, so we should not be satisfied with the existing achievements. But at present, various undertakings in the period of national construction often feel that although there are many plans, the perseverance to implement them is not enough. Therefore, I cannot but express my utmost admiration for the fighting spirit of Mr. Zhang Jingjiang and many of his successors.</p>

<h3>The Dilemma of Intellectuals</h3>
<p>— Xuanxuan</p>
<p>Our intellectual class is out of touch. In the old days, it has lost the traditional rights of the scholar-officials. In the new era, it can only play a very small role in this capitalist society, such as small civil servants in institutions, clerks and documents in industry and commerce. As for pure intellectuals, such as writers, journalists, teachers, etc., economically speaking, they are just dependent figures. They are definitely not the chief executives, nor are they more "substantial" laborers. They mostly earn a meager living with a little skill that may or may not be necessary in this society. But society is too unstable. The more unstable society is, the less they can do, and the more pitiful they become.</p>
<p>I have a friend who used to work in literature and art. In recent years, seeing that there is no way out for literature and art, he switched to doing single-handed business. As soon as he did single-handed business, his face became rosier than before. There is also a friend who writes articles. Although his articles are not earth-shattering, in a civilized society, such works are definitely not too many. But now he sits in a securities firm every day, staring at the numbers on the quotation board. If he were born in the United States, at least his life would not be a problem. But in China, we do not need his sense of humor, nor do we need his wit, but he does need a job. Since he does not have a fixed job, speculation may be his only way out, although speculation is definitely not beneficial to society.</p>
<p>Ordinary intellectuals, of course, do not have outstanding knowledge. Maybe they just understand things a little more and know a little more about major events. But in China, a society where illiteracy accounts for more than 80%, they may have a great effect. Single-mindedness towards goodness may not necessarily bring peace to the country, but single-mindedness towards evil, people like Wu Yong and Niu Jinxing, can all be considered "scholars."</p>
<p>This is really an unbearable situation.</p>
<p>In this society, the more knowledge one has, the more one suffers losses. We do not need to deny this. But those in power cannot ignore this fact. Merchants with bloated brains can laugh at intellectuals for "deserving it," but those in authority must not think like this. They must at least do their best to make up for shortcomings and do a little "correction" to the status quo, so that the useful ones do not suffer too much. In the past, non-intellectuals suffered too much, and we have already experienced the consequences today. Now, if we go the other way, the consequences may be even more terrible.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Not Buying Books</h3>
<p>— Ye Jun</p>
<p>On the 25th, Mr. Ze Shi published a great article titled "Chinese People and Books" in this publication, asserting definitively about Chinese people's reading habits, "This is because Chinese people do not like to read, which also means they lack the desire to learn." If this "Chinese people" refers only to non-civil servant Chinese, I dare not disagree for the moment, but if it includes civil servants, then to say they all "do not like to read" or "lack the desire to learn" is something I cannot accept. Why? Let me explain.</p>
<p>Although I am not yet a civil servant, I am the son of a civil servant. We come from a family of scholars. My father loves to read, and I also love to read. Therefore, I have indeed read some books. I wouldn't dare say I'm learned enough to fill five carts, but I have certainly consumed a lot of black and blue ink. Needless to say, we like to buy books. But have we actually bought any books? The answer is: a couple of months ago, I bought one or two, but for more than a hundred days now, I haven't bought even half a book. Why? Because I have no money.</p>
<p>We often see book reviews in the publishing sections of newspapers, and we want to buy them, but we have no money to buy them. We often see book titles in advertisements, and we want to buy them, but we have no money to buy them. We often flip through books in bookstores, and we want to buy them, but we have no money to buy them. We often discuss what books we want to buy, but in the end, we don't buy any books because we have no money.</p>
<p>Indeed, didn't Mr. Ze Shi's friend say, "My money for buying books comes from saving on things that can be spared or not. For example, if you are used to smoking white tin foil, why not switch to red tin foil, or only smoke four times a month, and use the saved money to buy a book? If you take rickshaws, switch to trams. If you are used to seeing first-run movies, switch to seeing late-run ones or not seeing them a few times. And so on. Such savings will not cause any loss, and there will be more than enough money to buy books." However, my family not only doesn't smoke white tin foil, but also doesn't smoke red tin foil. We can't even afford black tin foil. When we go out, we not only don't take rickshaws, but we also rarely take buses or trams. Most of the time, we still use "two-legged vehicles." As for movies, except for the few times I saw them on Sundays because I received some free military tickets from others, my family has never seen them. We don't even know what first-run or late-run movies are. Even so, we still have no money. The money we use is all for things that "cannot be spared at all." We have never used money that is "absolutely sparable" or "can be spared or not."</p>
<p>Let me calculate our expenses for you: my family has seven members, and my father's monthly income is less than four million yuan. However, we need about 1.3 piculs of rice per month. After deducting the ration of 0.3 piculs, we still need to buy 1 picul, which costs 2.45 million yuan (let's say 2.4 million yuan). Take this month as an example: apart from the 2.4 million yuan for buying rice, although I have public funding for university and don't need to pay tuition, I have one younger brother and two younger sisters in elementary school. The fee for each student in a municipal elementary school is 810,000 yuan, so three students cost 2.43 million yuan. This alone exceeds our monthly income by a lot. In addition, can we not buy side dishes? Can we not get haircuts? Can we absolutely not take trams? Can we not communicate with friends? Can we not take medicine when we are sick? Where does the money to buy books come from!</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason why civil servants don't buy books is indeed because of poverty, at least in my family. And I think there must be many families like mine!</p>
<p>Books, oh books, I want to buy you but have no money. I want to read you but have little time.</p>
<h3>Ernan</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Regarding news about Mr. Chu Nanqiang, I received word from my old friend Fang Jiekang yesterday that he is still living in seclusion in his hometown and that they communicate regularly. This brought me great joy. Recently, after reading Mr. Shi's article, I learned that Jian Weng is still healthy in his old age. Although times have changed, the blessed land remains intact, and my old friend is strong. This is truly a great pleasure.</p>
<p>Around 1928 and 1929, the trend of developing famous mountains could be described as extremely popular. Wu Zhislao and Xu Jinglao developed Huangshan, Mr. Chu Nanqiang developed Liangdong, and Mr. Jiang Shunan developed Yanyan. They devoted themselves to opening up roads, renovating temples, planting trees, hosting tourists, publishing guides, and promoting these places with all their might. In particular, Mr. Chu and Mr. Jiang used their individual strength, persevering tirelessly, and were eventually able to greatly transform the scenic spots of Liangdong and Yandang. People admired their names and visited them in succession, and the two gentlemen often personally took on the responsibility of hosting these tours. Their enthusiasm and perseverance should be appreciated by the mountain spirits.</p>
<p>My visit to Yandang was due to the introduction of my old friend Huang Binhong. In the summer of 1931, I traveled south along the sea with my painting student Xu Peiji, entering the mountain from Yongjia Leqing. I received gracious hospitality from Mr. Shunan, and his son guided me throughout the mountain. I stayed in the mountains for a month, creating six albums of paintings, which marked the beginning of my on-site research on Chinese landscape painting sketching. To this day, Lingyan Lingfeng, Dalongqiu, Beishiliang, Jing Temple, and Old Monk Rock still bear the inscriptions I made at that time.</p>
<p>Mr. Shunan originally studied martial arts and possessed great talent and ambition. However, he obviously did not fit in with the times and was frustrated. He once annihilated more than 300 bandits in one fell swoop near his hometown of Dajing, clearing the banditry in the Yongjia area for several years. Mr. Shunan was generous in his drinking. His residences in Dajing, as well as Yantianwo in Yandang, were filled with liquor jars. One year, when Mr. Shunan came to Shanghai, he drank with Mr. Binhong at a certain hotel in Paoqiu Square. Each time a pot was emptied, it was placed on the seat. The two talked and drank, and the seat was filled with pots, but their enthusiasm had not waned. I couldn't drink and could only watch, but I already felt tipsy. I excused myself and returned home first. A few days later, I visited Mr. Binhong with Mr. Shunan on Ximen Road. At that time, there were several bottles of Moutai that a friend had given as a gift. The two resumed their unrestrained drinking, leaving only half a bottle. Mr. Shunan took it with him, also carrying a painting of Dalongqiu that I had made. Halfway to his destination, he accidentally dropped the bottle onto the car. When he picked it up, the bottle was broken, and the remaining liquor was about to spill. Unwilling to waste it, he drank it all in one gulp. By the time he arrived at his residence, it was all gone. He told me about it the next day, and we laughed together.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Shunan's tomb is already covered with trees. Jiekang said that his eldest son has also passed away. In Yandang Mountain, there are now people gathering and causing trouble, making it impossible to revisit. Hearing that Mr. Nanqiang is healthy brings me joy, but remembering Mr. Shunan brings me grief. The most heroic and unrestrained people I have met in my life are undoubtedly these two gentlemen. Obviously, they were both unable to be of great use to the world and could only be with the mountains and forests. The misfortune of the two gentlemen is also the misfortune of the nation.</p>

<p>Chapter 11: A Bellyful of Doubts (85)</p>
<p>Qi Wan said, "Think about it, what era was it before, and what era is it now? If I don't know one or two influential figures of the time, I will be at the mercy of others. Especially with my position, I can easily offend people unintentionally." Zhu Qi was taken aback again and asked, "According to what you say, you are going to occupy a position in the opera world forever!" Qi Zhi smiled coldly and said, "If I don't work hard in my profession, what will this family eat and drink?" Zhu Qi saw that Qi Zhi's answer was completely contrary to her usual principles, and he was momentarily angry, saying, "Qi! I have always cared for you. No matter how your environment and your psychology change, I will protect you from going astray. Your association with such a person of questionable reputation is very detrimental to your status." Qi Zhi listened and remained silent. At this time, Little Wang's mother also came in and said from the side, "I think that Section Chief is very impatient. He curses people at the drop of a hat. I think the boss..." Qi Zhi glared at her before she could finish speaking and said, "Don't talk too much!" Little Wang's mother was scolded by her and lowered her head, not daring to speak anymore. Zhu Qi continued, "Whether this person is impatient or not, being with them is very unfavorable to you. Your status is different from others. When you bring out your reputation, who wouldn't respect you! Besides, your future is unlimited, and you don't need to rely on these martial arts friends to protect you! Now that this news has been published in the newspaper, people outside are talking about it. It will be troublesome to explain. I hope you pull back from the brink and don't make mistake after mistake." Qi Zhi said, "I have my own methods. I don't think there is anything wrong. I know that my reputation is very precious, and I won't involve others unless it is absolutely necessary." Zhu Qi saw that Qi Zhi's words were so decisive that she probably wouldn't accept anything more he said. He stood up angrily and said, "I am sincerely advising you. This matter concerns your reputation and your future. It doesn't have much to do with me." Qi Zhi said, "Of course it doesn't have much to do with you!" Zhu Qi said, "These are your own words. Then I have done my duty to advise you. Goodbye!" He said, walking away angrily. Qi Zhi ignored him, pursed her lips, and watched him leave. Little Wang's mother chased after Zhu Qi to the door, repeatedly urging him to come again tomorrow. Zhu Qi left unhappily. Little Wang's mother returned upstairs and saw Qi Wan crying next to her pillow!</p>
<h3>Life and Education</h3>
<p>— Tu Wanong</p>
<p>— Thoughts on the Tragic Murder of Professor Xu Shouchang</p>
<p>"I, Mr. Xu, killed him. You come and arrest me. I'll make it easy for you, but please agree to my demands. First, my parents are very poor. I have more than ten thousand Taiwan dollars and a watch. Please send someone to my house. Second, let me write a letter to my parents. If you don't agree, I will never admit it, or I will commit suicide."</p>
<p>"The prison warden agreed to his request, and he wrote a letter home, mainly saying: 'I am ashamed of you two elders. Don't think about me after this inhumane act. The education I received was also wasted. Please burn all the books I read before!'"</p>
<p>The case of the assassination of Xu Shouchang, director of the Chinese Department of National Taiwan University, has been solved. The murderer, Gao Wanche, turned out to be a young worker. Because this house used to be the Taiwan Provincial Translation Hall, the murderer kept a key to the gate. He entered the room in the middle of the night to steal, but Mr. Xu discovered him in bed with a flashlight. In a moment of desperation, the murderer pulled out a firewood knife and struck a vicious blow. A scholar who tirelessly taught and wrote extensively died tragically under the blind and arrogant consciousness of the murderer. This is a most painful and tragic event!</p>
<p>According to reports, the murderer was very afraid and remorseful after killing Mr. Xu. Therefore, after being arrested, he admitted: "I deserve to pay him with my life." Alas! National essence is gone. To use a straw bag to pay with his life is truly like comparing Mount Tai with a feather. What can it compensate for?</p>
<p>The motive and beginning of this tragic case are actually simple, entirely based on poverty and ignorance, leading to the act of violence when the theft was discovered. Gao Wanche deserves to die. However, when he was arrested, he never forgot his parents, giving the remaining money and watch to them. Furthermore, he realized that "the education I received was also wasted, please burn all the books I read before!" After all, people are people. Sometimes they go against reason and act unlawfully, and sometimes their conscience awakens, and they face death as if returning home. Gao Wanche is an example of the intensification of life's contradictions.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Shouchang was a pure scholar, respected for his articles and morality. He also devoted himself to education and did not talk about politics. His death this time is even more regrettable! And what is most moving is what the murderer said - "The education I received was also wasted, please burn all the books I read before!" Gao Wanche probably felt, after knowing his crime, that education was ineffective and that he had lived in vain!</p>
<p>Education! Education! What kind of "thing" is education in today's world? The whip of life forces educated people to go astray, unable to extricate themselves. After the case of Xu Shouchang's assassination has been revealed, we grieve for the unjust death of the deceased, and also for the vain life of the living. We especially grieve for the bleak and colorless future of education!</p>
<h3>Flower Affairs Novels and Wei Chun Garden</h3>
<p>— Yu Yifen</p>
<p>In Mr. Liu Yan-sheng's article "Old Scenes of Shanghai" published in this newspaper on the 20th, it stated, "As for the flying carriages surrounding beautiful women, we can see the scenes of that year in the Nine-tailed Turtle written by Haishang Shushi Sheng and the Shanghai Flower Records written in Shanghai dialect." This is a mistake. According to Mr. Zhang Chunfan, the author of the Nine-tailed Turtle (whose name is the same as Zhang Chunfan, the husband of Xiao Dangui), also known as the Master of Shushu Liushanfang, the protagonist Zhang Qiugu is actually a self-portrait. I used to meet him several times with my teachers Han Yunlin and Wu, he was stout and short-sighted, a dignified elder, and he did not seem like the romantic and unrestrained character in the book. As for Haishang Shushi Sheng, it is the alias of Mr. Sun Yusheng. He wrote Shanghai's Prosperous Dreams and the martial arts novel Five-flower Sword of Immortals and Knights. He indulged in pleasure in his youth, but after middle age, he stopped visiting entertainment venues and was able to maintain a light figure and remain vigorous in old age. He founded the Prosperous News, which was the beginning of small newspapers in Shanghai. He especially encouraged young people. I first met him in the winter of Guihai and considered him a friend despite the age gap. He died of illness in Shanghai during the war at the age of eighty-odd. The author of the Shanghai Flower Records is Flower Also Pitiful, who first wrote the book in Suzhou dialect, which is a unique style in fiction. After being promoted by Hu Shih, the name began to be famous. The Dream of Prosperity and the Nine-tailed Turtle also use Suzhou dialect, which became popular after publication, so there are many sequels. I used to enjoy entertainment and liked to pay attention to the past events in this area. I wish I could read all three books to the end, but the volumes were too long.</p>
<p>Flying carriages should refer to horse-drawn carriages. At that time, the most popular were steel wire double-axle covered carriages, called Hansoms (a transliteration of the English word "pretty," which is what Shanghai people call Yangjingbang). Famous courtesans were taken out on outings, often acting as drivers themselves. The destination was Ankaidi in Wei Chun Garden in western Shanghai. Every time the sun was setting and the lanterns were not yet lit, the silk fans and gauze dresses fluttered as they arrived, and the jeweled carriages and beaded curtains arrived one after another, enjoying the coolness and expanding their views. It was truly the unrestrained emotions of rouge and powder and the grand occasion of women's ornaments. Among the courtesans, Lin Daiyu, Jin Xiaobao, Zhang Shuyu, and Lu Guanfen were known as the Four Beauties, obviously carrying the dragons and elephants among them, indulging in flowers and the moon, extremely fascinating for a time. In the garden, you could often see the shadows of their whips and hairpins. Wei Chun Garden was the property of Zhang Shuhe from Wuxi. The world has changed, and the garden can no longer be seen, but even today, the area around Jing'an Temple Road and Moore Ming Road is still called Zhang Family Garden. (Editor's note: "Ting Simei" seems to come from the English word Hansom, which originally meant a changing wheel carriage. Mr. Yu's so-called "pretty" should be Handsome. It is unknown which one is correct, so both are recorded.)</p>
<h3>My School Friends</h3>
<p>— Xue Xueyuan</p>
<p>I was deeply touched by Mr. Sun He's article "Memories of Ling Yange" published in the Free Talk section of February 5th, and I regret that I don't know exactly who Mr. Sun is. "Sun He" I think is a pen name (the original article said it was a teaching colleague, but it was not clear which school). The record is truly methodical, stable and detailed, and there are also one or two misrememberings. I am from "Peking University" rather than "Beiyang". This matter relates to my academic record, so I must clarify it. Now, I will talk about my school and my school friends.</p>
<p>My school "Peking University" is not slang. It can be called the foremost, oldest, largest, and highest institution of higher learning in the country, from the Imperial University of Peking (the pre-Qing translation name Imperial University) to Peking University (the Republic of China translation name Government University, later changed to Peking University). From its founding in the year before the founding of the Republic of China to today, it has been celebrating its 50th anniversary. Before and in the early days of the Republic of China, there was only this one in the capital, and it occupied the same lofty position as the "Taixue" in ancient history (that is, the Imperial College, which represents the national school). Therefore, when "University" or "University student" was mentioned, everyone knew it, and there was no need to add a prefix, like the "Bald General without a Character" in history. As Liu Jin said in the play "Famen Temple", "This job is enough to obtain!"</p>
<p>The historical evolution of my school can be divided into three periods: (1) When it was founded 14 years before the Republic of China, it was only because the capital needed a lofty and large school, and it did not consider what conditions a university should have or what level university students should be. Moreover, primary and secondary schools had not yet been established, and there were no students who were promoted level by level, so there could not be qualified university students who could apply. Therefore, teachers and students were very complex, including Jinshi and Juren from the old imperial examinations, and mathematics and astronomy students from Tongwenguan. The curriculum and subjects were also arbitrary. The so-called "University" was just a "Large School," not a "University" in the sense of the word. It was not until the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences University three years before the Republic of China that it became a real university. This is the first period. (2) The second period was from the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences University to the reform in 1919, when the New Culture Movement occurred. After the reform in 1919, it entered the third period, until today. (In the past 30 years, some changes have occurred due to political changes, such as the restoration of the "Imperial University of Peking" during Zhang Zuolin's time, which are not enough to be called stages, and will not be discussed.)</p>
<p>I was one of the first students admitted to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences University. There were more than 500 students in the seven departments. Now, let me first mention a few of our civil engineering classmates. The one with the best graduation performance was Xia Changchi (Zi Guangyu, from Qingpu, Jiangsu). He worked in the Ministry of Communications in Beijing for several years. After the capital moved south, he also undertook many famous projects in the south. After the victory, he was also appointed as the transportation rehabilitation supervisor and commissioner in the central China area. (Last year, I saw in the newspaper that this name or title was not entirely consistent with the original title.) I think there are many people who know him in the north and south of the Yangtze River. This old classmate, Brother Guangyu, was gentle and refined in his youth, and very diligent. He always ranked first in the big exams, and we jokingly called him "Xia Zhuangyuan". After the "September 18th" incident, he visited me once and we had a long conversation. It has been many years since we last met. There were also Ye Shenxiu (named Yongbao, from Suzhou, civil engineering) and Wang Jianqing (from Changzhou, mining). Both brothers graduated from Suzhou High School and entered Peking University. Those who came from Guangdong were Lao Qu (his Nick name was Potatoe), Lao Chen (Boyu), Lao Li (Wenji), and Lao Li (Boxian), Lao Mai from the mining class, and Lao Wu (Cifeng), Lao Zhang (Litang) who graduated from Shandong High School. They have always served in the engineering field in central and southern China. Recently, I received a letter from Lao Zhang forwarded by the editorial department of this newspaper. He saw the text about Ling Yange and the Faculty of Engineering of Peking University in Gansu while reading the Shen Bao, and only then did he know that the old classmates were safe. They are now working in the Lanzhou-Tianshui Railway Engineering Bureau, healthy as usual. I have other letters, but the journey is far away and there is no fixed shipping date, so I will add a few words here and ask him to convey my thoughts to a dozen or so older classmates.</p>
<p>At that time, there were many students in the seven departments (which would be called seven colleges according to the current system), and it was difficult to know them all. Especially the many friends in the liberal arts and law departments did not have academic exchanges with us engineers, and we did not have time to identify them. It was not until a few years after graduation, when I myself changed careers, that I had the opportunity to meet a few people through other social occasions in the political, academic, and journalistic circles. After being introduced by others, I realized that they were the classmates who took the same entrance exam. I will not explain them one by one here. I will only mention two "famous people". One fragrant and one stinky, one alive and one dead. The fragrant one, the living one, is Lao Liu (named Zhe, Zi Jingxing, from the Northeast), who is currently the vice president of the Control Yuan, with a high position. He often recites the sentence "Many classmates in their youth were not lowly," and Brother Jingyu is worthy of this sentence. He was Minister of Education in 1927. I was teaching in two universities, and our positions were far apart, so we never communicated. In 1935, when he was a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee, I met him a few times at the press reception. When we talked about the old days of Ma Shen Temple, we were filled with emotion. And now we have experienced more vicissitudes. The stinky one, the dead one, is Liang Hongzhi, a well-known traitor, one of the leaders of the puppet Reformed Government, who has been punished by the national law and his reputation has been ruined. He brought it upon himself, and I cannot bear to mention it. This person once served as the "President of the Puppet Supervisory Yuan." Brother Jingyu's academic friendship with this person is closer than mine. The two supervisory councils, one true and one false, also show that Brother Jingyu must have a deeper regret and joy for Liang's talent and bad behavior.</p>

<h3>Weak Will Seduced into Losing Virginity, It's Too Late to Mend the Fold After the Sheep Are Lost</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinbao asked if his girlfriend, a certain Jia, had a relationship with a certain Yi in 1946, which then developed into a physical relationship. Later, Yi went to another port to seek work and then disappeared. It has recently been learned that Yi has returned to Shanghai and is about to marry a certain Bing. Now, there are several questions. Please answer: (1) Can the female ask the male Yi to marry her? (2) If not, can she accuse the male Yi of abandonment? (3) Can she ask the male Yi for compensation? (4) Is there any way to remedy this?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuangzhen's Answer] (1) If the woman and the man Yi had consensual sex and were not engaged, then she cannot ask the man Yi to marry her.
