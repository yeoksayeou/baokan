<h3>央行先撥一萬餘億元　農貸本月內發放　分配原則決採重點主義</h3>
<p>〔報南京廿一日電〕本年農貸，經四聯理事會確定爲十五萬倍後，資金籌措問題，中農行與央行商洽結果，央行已於三月起先撥一萬四千七百五十億元，即可由中農行於本月內分配於各地發放。至全部農貸各省分配之數字，亦由中農行行務會議商定分配之原則，係採重點主義，並與農部之增產計劃相配合，各省數字之多寡，相差頗鉅，據中農行總經理李叔明稱：爲求農貸真正有益於生產，惟望採用此項辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕中農行行務會議述續開會四日，硏討農貸按術問題與實施辦法，已於廿一日下午閉幕。該會先後通過議案一百餘件，大多數皆爲農貸之具體實施辦法，即可由各分行按照決議案施行。該行總經理李叔明於廿一日下午六時招待記者，報告本年農貸方針之轉向，據李氏稱；本年農貸因與產密切配合，其方針與往年有顯著不同之點有五：（一）所有農貸配額以及實施辦法，悉依據政府已定計劃，尤以糧棉等項屢與農部磋商，使之配合，以期集中力量，向同一目標邁進。（二）爲謀增產效果之切實，採重點主義，擇定生產中心，力避分散，而杜浪費。（三）農業生產自生產加工製造遝銷止，全部過程原應有一貫之整套辦法，方能完成任務，此事久已規劃，本年乃得實施機會，藉以聯成一體，使其一氣呵成，一以保障農民利益，一以有助於物資之合理流通。（四）農業欲現代化，必須能爲企業之經營，久在此目標下努力，而成效未著，本年起期能引導入於企業經營之途，而使樹立其初基。（五）農貸之處理，每易受人批評，本行原亦樂予接受，自謀改善，今年適値良好機會，故於農貸手續之簡化與貸款之效果特加研討，務使實惠及於農民，並能眞正奏生產效果。</p>
<h3>紐約僑胞收入不惡　多數僑匯均逃香港　陳中海暢談華僑情況</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕昨由美返抵京之美東華僑國大代表陳中海，頃對記者詳談紐約之華僑情形。陳氏結業於美國哥倫比亞大學，取得哲學博士學位現任紐約中華公所主席。中華公所爲全紐約華僑之最高指導機構。陳氏謂，紐約絕大多數僑胞，均擁護政府，熟愛祖國，彼等唯一希望，即戡亂工作早日完成，成爲一强大而民主之國家。當地僑胞，除少數共產黨者外，均深惡共產黨。華僑對於祖國及其家人甚爲愛念，故均以勤儉中所得餘期，寄回祖國。日前由於外匯黑市價格與官價相去甚遠，故渠等多不願由國家銀行匯款至祖國，僑華因而逃避至香港。同時僑胞有將儲蓄之金銀資財親帶返祖國者，由於海關之留難檢查，甚至沒收。往往使返國僑胞蒙受極大投失，望政府當局速加以注意。對於僑胞之投資，陳氏稱，僑胞均願將其所有，投資於祖國，但望祖國先有安定之經濟社會及對投資有保障。陳氏舉例稱，在抗戰勝利之初，全美各地華僑，均熱心於祖國投資，故各項計劃，一經宣佈，即行募集得鉅款，惟後因幣値不穩，社會欠安定，所以僑胞之投資，不得不取觀望態度。紐約之僑胞，經濟生活甚佳，失業華僑，人數甚少，而最低工作之工資，每月除供膳宿以外，尚有二百五十美元，如餐館廚師，每月工資，除店主供給膳宿外，尚可得六七百美元。</p>
<h3>僑胞教育問題　多數學童均就讀外校</h3>
<p>多數學童均就讀外校</p>
<p>本國敎科書不切實用</p>
<p>至紐約華僑敎育問題之嚴重性，亦如海外各地，全紐約城約有華僑三至四萬人，其中婦女佔四分之一，男性佔四分之三，　　入學之幼童，有七至八一百人，但現紐約僅有華僑小學一所，在校人數約二百人，其餘之華僑子弟，均就讀於一當地外國學校。陳氏對中國敎科書未能因適應僑胞之需要而予以專門編輯，不無感慨。渠稱：舉列言之，小學之公民敎科書中，有敎小學生天天洗面·刷牙·換衣服等，在外國小孩子，很小就自知刷牙，而且他所知道的，還比敎科書詳盡。更有甚者，敎科書中有叙述華盛頓者，在美之華僑子弟，早已知華盛頓其人其事，而且其中由於譯述之錯誤，更使華僑子弟，讀之而生惡感。諸如此類之敎科書，對僑胞子弟，實無法引起興趣。此亦爲僑敎失敗之一因。紐約之華僑文化，爲全美最　達者，現有日報五家（其中一家爲中國其產黨所辦），週刋三家，差不多每家華僑均讀報云。</p>
<h3>馬占山新職　內定東北騎兵總司令</h3>

<h3>美購暹米運華　工作即將完成　澳允售我小麥二萬噸</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷廿一日電〕據此間美國新聞處息：美國爲救濟中國，在暹羅採購食米三萬噸之工作幾近完成。作爲救濟供應之食米，約近二萬噸業經運華，其中四千噸運至上海，其餘運至廣州，所餘尚未運出之一萬噸，其裝載工作，刻在進行中。所有米運，可望於三月底前完竣。按此項食米採購，係爲美國之聯總結束後方案中之一部，方案中規定美國以價値二千七百七十萬美元之糧食及醫藥品運至中國，作爲緊急救濟。美國駐暹大使史丹頓，曾於一月間宣布採購協定時稱：此項採購方案，亦於暹羅有利，蓋暹羅可藉此獲得五百萬美元之外匯。又此項食米，係由聯合國國際緊急糧食會議配予中國者。</p>
<p>〔中央社雪梨廿一日電〕澳洲政府已允許以小麥二萬噸售與中國，惟價格尚未確定，現樣品三種已送交中國選擇。按中國原要求在澳購買小麥四萬噸。</p>

<h3>實行全面的土地改革！</h3>
<p>華中綏靖會議通過總體戰方案之後，巳於廿日圓滿閉幕。這一方案，除了糾正過去軍事政治上的缺點而外，並規定軍事，政治，經濟三者並重，切實配合；其中最惹人注意的一項，厥爲實行戰士授田辦法，規定在原則上每一戰士授田三畝至五畝，其詳細辦法另訂之。同時綏靖會議又將綏靖區土地處理辦法修正通過，在原則上決定：「綏靖區土地非自耕最者，無論經共匪非法分配與否，均按其家屬每人以五畝爲限，准許保留；超過此數，則由政府徵收，發給土地實物債劵，於十五年內償還，土地即爲自耕農所有」，但其具體辦法，尚待國防部與地政部詳細研究，並須完成立法程序。我國土地改革，不僅是一個經濟問題，而且也是一個政治問題；在此戡亂建國期間，這一個問題的根本解決，實爲決定中國朱來命運的重要因素。中國土地改革協會前日且在京特向中外記者宣佈其擬就之「中國土地改革方案」，以供全國朝野的參考與採納，可見這個土地改革問題此時實在値得我們的重視。</p>
<p>我國一向就是一個「以農立國」的農業國家，全國人口百分之八十是「以農爲生」的農民，而土地的分配問題幾成爲數千年來歷代治亂的關鍵，可是，從來也沒有獲得一勞永逸的解決。國父孫中山先生早就看到這偶問題的重要性，將土地改革列爲革命的基本任務之一。孫先生在同盟會時代，就與「驅除韃虜」同時呌出「平均地權」的口號，其後又在民生主義的演講中，提出具體而切實的辦法，以達到「耕者有其田」的最高理想。他在建國大綱中，更有第十條的規定：「縣開創自治之時，必須先規定全縣私有土地之價。其由地主自報之地方，政府則照價征稅，並可隨時照價收買，自此次報價之後，若土地因政治之改良社會之進步而增價者，則其利益爲全縣人民所共享，使原主不得私之」。他以「耕者有其田」的主張，充實「平均地　」的內容，不論在理論上或實際上，都是解決土地問題最好的辦法。我們假定國民政府目奠都南京之後，即拿出決心，拿出誠意，實行國父這種辦法，那末中國的農村經濟當非今日的面目，而其他經濟建設也早可奠定　實的基礎了。但是二十年來，一方面固然由於外患內亂的循環不息，使政府不作此根本之圖，一方面也因爲政府始終猶豫旁　，不下決心，所採取關於土地的政策及頒佈的法令，均未能根本解法這一個嚴重的問題，以致反被共匪利用它來作爲政治鬥爭的武器。政府對於這一失策，是不能不深切反省的。</p>
<p>放眼看看共匪對於土地問題所採取的政策和行動，很明顯的，它也已從「土地革命」走向「土地改革」。民國十六年國民黨實行淸黨的時候，共黨原是主張「土地革命」，以暴力沒收地主的土地，分配給農民。其後十七年共黨宣佈土地政綱」，十九年兩次頒佈「土地法」，二十年頒佈第三次「土地法」，內容雖有變動，但是都是一脈相承的「土地革命」。直到七七事變全面抗戰爆發，共黨於九月二十三日發表國共合作宣言，始鄭重聲明：「停止以暴力沒收地主土地的政策。」抗戰勝利之後，共黨又弄兵作亂，企圖以武力擴充地盤，乃復在河北，山束，蘇北等，恢復土地革命的辦法。但是這種向地主淸算的「土地革命」實行的結果，不僅未能减輕貧晨的痛苦，反而加深了農村的破產。同時共匪爲欺瞞外人，使其誤信共匪爲土地改革的政黨起見，乃於去年十月十日頒佈「土地法大綱」，改變面目，也詭稱實行「耕者有其田」的土地制度。雖然廢除了地主的土地私有制，但是承認了農民的土地私有制。共匪的這一轉變，直接說明了「土地革命」的不適合中國國情，無論如何終是行不通的，間接也就證明了國父所倡導的土地改革的主張，是解決中國土地問題的惟一途徑。不過共匪目前所行的土地改革實際上並不是「耕者有其田」。他們乃以舊地主的土地限制的餘額，普徧分配於各戶口，不問他是否自耕，而又容許分配受田之後即可　讓，故舊地主遭淸算而打倒，新地主不久即自然產生。這真是掛了羊頭　狗肉的辦法。但，我們應該知道：三民主義是國民政府一切施政方針的最高原則，也是國民革命所欲完成的最高理想。民生主義的未能眞正實行，國民黨應該引以爲恥辱！現在共匪旣以國父的土地政策作爲政治鬥爭的武器，國民政府怎能再不急起直追呢？這次　中綏靖會議決定修正綏靖區土地處理辦法，不失爲一種進步的賢明的措置。</p>
<p>目下共匪所騷擾的區域，　着其叛亂的發展而擴大，而共匪正在那裏標榜其所謂「土地改革」，因此土地的鬥爭與軍事的鬥爭也就成爲共匪叛亂的二大武器。所以政府對於土地問題，必須趕快大刀闊斧，，切實　行國父遺敎，實行土地改革，達到眞正「耕者有其田」的程度，然後軍事上的戡亂，前途乃可樂觀。因此，我們對於土地改革問題，也願提出若干意見以供當局的考慮。</p>
<p>第一，政府廿年來未能切實解決我國土地問題，不能不說是國民黨執政的一大失敗，推　其故，或因國民黨的構成份子中，比較複雜，或有着干封建勢力的大地主隱伏其間，從中作梗，然而國民黨在其本質上應該是一個實行平均地權的革命黨，阻撓土地改革的囑朽勢力必須予以排除。政府當局現在旣知土地改革的重要，且已決定實行，就應該拘着「往者不諫，來者可追」的態度，急起直追，速謀國父對於土地改革的主張的實現。從華中綏靖會議的決議看來，土地改革尚以綏靖區爲限，我們却認為這種局部解決的辦法，頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，依然不會解決整個問題的。為今之計，唯有在全國各地，遵照</p>
<p>國父　敎，切實辦理。中國土地改革協會所擬訂的中國土地改革方案，當可作為全國朝野和研究討論的基礎。尤其知識份子，應該覺悟圑結，督促政府在最短期內，有一個通行全國的土地改革辦法，不分南北，不分綏靖區或非綏靖區，都要切實辦理，以　成民生主義對於平均地權的所規定的目標·如此，不特有利於　亂工作的進行，而且也可為全國經濟建設奠定一個堅實的　　。</p>
<p>第二，解決土地問題最澈底的辦法，莫過於耕者有其田。但是如何被告，却有各式各樣的辦法，值得我們的研究。共匪初以暴力沒收地主的土地分配給農民，現在則改為「按人口平均分配土地」，那祗是一種「平分土地」的辦法，並北眞正的「耕者有其田」。其流弊所及，自然不一而足，而最顯著的，就不過打倒了奮地主扶植了新地主—在共黨卵冀下的橷地主，於自耕的貧農絲毫無益。國民政府今後究應採取何種辦法，最爲澈底呢？中國土地改革協會建議，主張終止佃耕制，化佃農為自耕農，以達到耕者有其出的目標，當然比共距區內所強行的好多了，是否可以採行，實在值得研究。</p>
<p>第三，今日的農村，經過八年的抗戰，二年半的匪亂，早已到了破產的邊綠，單靠了「耕者有共出」的改革，恐仍不足以挽救農村的貧困。老實說，如果政府不設法採取救濟農村的其他辦法，一般「告貸無門」的貧農，拿到了容許自耕的土地，不但無法從事耕耘，而且簡直還是無法生活下去。所以當此全國朝野注意土地改革問題之際，我們不得不爲全國貧苦的農村呼籲，請政府在徵兵徵糧的政策上甫作通盤的考慮，同時在發放農貸的技術上要切實做到貸給眞正的農民，力足以拯救他們早日脫離水火。</p>
<p>第四，在土地改革之前，若舍本逐末空談改良土壤，消滅害蟲，改良種籽，以及農具機械化等，固然無異於隔靴掻癢，解決不了實際問題，但是在實行土地改革之時，若不能同時改革農業生產的技術與經營的方式，而使中國農村永遠逗留於古老的模型裏，也是挽救不了農村經濟的崩潰的。</p>
<p>要之，時至今日，爲戡亂建國的前途計，實行全面的土地改革，實在刻不容緩。華中綏靖會議的這一決議，可說搔到了癢處。然而，我們還更希望政府萬不可只做被動的工作，以爲土地改革只要在綏靖區裏去辦，必須澈頭澈尾實行全面的土地改革。</p>

<h3>穗商婦產怪胎　雙頭女嬰</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿一日電〕穗市婦孺醫院今晨於產婦分娩中，接獲一雙頭女嬰。該嬰四肢與常人無異，兩頭分別生長於左右肩膊間，成對稱形，均有頸項，五官頭髮俱備，惟左邊頭顱較右邊頭顱稍小。據當値醫生告記者稱：產婦分娩時極感困難，經數小時手術後，嬰兒出生，但已斃亡。現產婦仍靜養院中，產婦爲杜周氏，卅歲，夫業商，當記者到院時，渠已早囑院方謝絕訪問。</p>
<h3>「限制農地地租」</h3>
<p>辦法俟政院核定施行</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕關於推行减租事項，國府於勝利時曾通令各省市，實施「二五減租」，凡勝利後豁免田賦之地區，應同時减租四分之一，但此項「二五减租」僅以免賦之當年爲限，係屬暫時性質，至於嗣後耕地租率在已依法規定地價之地方，地租不得超過地價百分之八，在未經依法規定地價之地方，則應遵照政院從弍字第一〇〇五〇號訓令，佃農應繳之地租，仍暫依正產物千分之三七五計算。廣西省訂有該省耕地租用實施辦法，呈准政院施行，依照該辦法第二條規定：「耕地地租應依土地法第一百十條之規定，切實予以限制」。湖南省所辦「二五减租」，該省地政局業經遵照减租原則，頒訂「湖南省免賦减租實施辦法」，令各市縣切實施行，此項免賦减租事宜，延至卅六年仍在補辦中，其辦法照原租額减去四分之一，並非指「正產物千分之三七五」之規定。其他如贛·閩·浙·鄂。湘。粤。綏等省，亦有同樣單行辦法公布實施，地政部對於實行法定地租弊端之補救，前經依據經濟改革方案，擬訂「限制農地地租」辦法，規定耕地租賃契約須經審查登記，以資管制，庶可避免上項流弊之發生，該辦法業經全經會通過，轉呈政院核定施行。</p>

<h3>自衛衛國</h3>
<p>— 方治</p>
<p>戡亂剿匪，是我們旣定國策，全國上下為了維護國家民族最高的利益，為了保障自身的基本生存和民主自由的權利，爲了拯救匪區痛苦的人民，而動員一切人力物力財力與共匪搏鬥。我們要完成戡亂剿匪的任務，首先要認清「匪」是什麼？簡單的說，「匪」雖然也是黃面孔的中國人，可是他已喪失了人性，滅絕了天良，甘心出賣祖國，殘害自家弟兄，並且摧毀別人的生命，搶却別人的衣食，以發洩他的獸性，其狠毒兇殘的程度，較之歷史上任何流寇漢奸傀儡，都有過之無不及。今天的剿匪軍事，就是要肅淸推翻國本，斷要民命的共匪，如此，國家才有獨立自由，社會才有重獲安全的希望，這是無可置疑的事實。</p>
<p>在戡亂剿匪的時候，固然需要國軍將十在前綫，前仆後繼英勇慘烈的奮鬥犧牲，更需要有健全的地方武力保衛地方，因爲地方武力熟悉地形，作戰便利。如此次共匪竄擾豫西南陽，內鄉，淅川，鎭平一帶時，即遭當地民團奮勇堵擊，戰果輝煌，中央特爲明令嘉獎，並撥款犒勞。由此可見在剿匪期間自衛武力的建立，實屬刻不容緩。</p>
<p>上海市本年度的征兵工作，快要開始了，六千名新兵即將征集入營。這次所征的新兵，本來是要開到前綫去的，現在兵役會議通過，建議中央，就地訓練，兼固治安。因爲本市是國際都市，全國經濟工商業的中心，安危動關國本，地位異常重要，共匪居心叵測，日伺罅隙，如歷次工潮學潮的發生，以及丁錫山匪部的竄擾，都是共匪陰謀的顯露，此次六千新兵應征後，決定留在上海，就地訓練，以爲安定大上海的勁旅，換句話說，就是要他們來保衛自己的家鄉，保障自己的生命財產。我們看到匪區逃滬難民餐風露宿，過着流離顚沛的生活，看到報章雜誌連篇累積記載共匪禍國殃民的罪行，更聽到多少地方因共匪的燒殺刦掠而十室九空，無數同胞遭共匪的鬥爭淸算而家破人亡，由這些耳聞目繫的事實，就可以知道共匪是洪水猛獸，是無惡不作的人民蟊賊，如果我們不貢獻能力，及時自衛，一旦共匪竄擾，恐怕有財產，有田地，有知識的人，都要徬徨失所，走頭無路了。希望大家澈底認淸匪應的嚴重，認淸保國先要保家，保家須要社會安定，凡是及齡男子，不問貧富，不論階級，均應一致踴躍應征，這是自衛衛國的惟一途徑。總之，我們要繁榮大上海，安定大上海，首先要從訓練地方武力，保衛大上海做起，否則，「皮之不存毛將焉附！」這是値得我們每一個市民警惕的。</p>

<h3>義前屬領交義大利託管　三強原則獲協議　收回特港義人大感興奮</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿一日電〕美國最高級方面今日透露：西方强國在兩星期內，將繼特港自由區歸還義國之建議發表宣言，贊成由義大利託管非洲義前殖民地中之若千。託管理事會某美國代表稱，西方强國已就將義屬累瑪里蘭及伊利特里亞交義託管之點，成立原則上的協議。」英國反對將里比亞亦交義國託管，因英國已允諾當地土著，決不使彼等再受義國管制故也。</p>
<p>〔聯合羅馬二十日電〕義大利人民今夜歡迎特港交還義國之提議，政治集會因此項消息而打斷，無綫電台前羣衆機擴，各報館前搶購號外。「特里雅斯特萬歲」之呼聲響徹古城之街巷，共和國國旗飄揚於公私房屋。內閣總理加斯貝利稱，「這消息使我大快，我確信公道正在伸長。」共黨某領袖則嘆息曰，「我們又須從頭做起」。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕米蘭電台稱：特里埃斯特每一房屋之陽台上均高懸義大利國旗，羣衆則在街頭高唱義大利愛國歌曲，以慶祝英美法三强之決定將　港自由區歸還義國。　〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕美國今日以驚人行動，與英法共同提議將特里雅斯特區交還義大利。外交界權威人士認爲此乃援助義大利反共派在來日大選中取勝之敏捷行動。蓋特里雅斯特爲南斯拉夫埀涎區域，蘇聯對此處境爲難，倘若支持美英法之提議，將使南斯拉夫不歡，倘蘇聯反對以特港交還，則將使義共黨遭受打擊，不能爭取民心。佔有特港乃義大利最大政治問題，義共黨正盼望蘇聯之行動。蘇聯與西方國家倘不能妥協，則特港將爲英美佔領眾與南斯拉夫軍佔領間之無限期分治區域，此種情形足以導致危險。南駐美大使柯薩諾維對於英美法之提議，深爲震動，據稱，「余不知此舉是否欲挑撥南斯拉夫採取一種步驟，使其他國家亦有直接參與時局之藉口。余不知美國政府何以事事不願爲聯合國機構出力」。</p>
<h3>法義訂關稅同盟　皮杜爾會晤義大利總理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：都林訊，法外長皮杜爾今日在記者招待會上宣稱，渠對於西方各國建議將特里埃斯特區交還義大利一節在義國境內所引起之反響，深表欣喜，有詢以此項宣布，是否以影響四月十八日義國選舉爲目的，皮氏展開雙手，微笑曰：「無所奉告」，昨日皮杜爾將與義總理加斯貝里會晤，士致將就英美法有關特港之建議，有所商談。今日，義外長史福　會晤皮杜爾，對於特港問題之新發展深表欣喜，認爲此舉足以打擊共產黨在競選中之地位。據悉，此項建議，早在三星期前即已擬就，惟美國希望皮杜爾能在赴義訪問時在義國共產黨勢力最强之地區加以宣佈。此在南斯拉夫方面，共黨報紙聲稱，此乃帝國主義者在義國選舉前所玩弄之一種手段。</p>
<p>〔路透社都林二十日電〕法外長皮杜爾與義外長史福　今日在此間馬達瑪古宮，簽訂法義關稅同盟議定書，法義商務協定及支付協定。皮杜爾於簽畢致辭時，並宣布英美法已向蘇聯及義大利建議將特里埃斯特自由區歸還義大利。義外長史福薩表表今日所簽之協約，在近代史上尚無先例，將影響法義兩國一億人民之思想利益及財產。此兩大民族將向世界表現雙方雖仍保持其不同的傳統性質，仍能從事最有系統及收穫的團結。此西方文明之兩支巨光，將愈益增加其勢力。</p>
<h3>英美駐軍警戒　防特港事變</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿一日電〕消息靈通人士稱：南斯拉夫對西方盟國所提交還時港之反響，可能在該區產生「緊張或危險」之局面。彼等稱，一旦反饗發生，該區一萬英美軍均將奉命警戒。發言人稱，南國在特港左右示威「卯常可能」，惟已採取步驟以防義人及斯拉夫人衝突。傳英美法三國上週在巴黎會議時，即已考慮斯拉夫人之反響及其後果。</p>
<h3>西歐五國將討論　設咨詢委會</h3>

<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾二十日電〕英法荷比盧五國外長之代表，將於下週三在此舉行特別會議，討論西歐聯盟公約內規定之五國咨詢委員會。就下列三點，向五國政府提出建議：（一）咨詢委員會總部設何處，在何地舉行會議；（二）開會時期；（三）秘書處之組織及任命秘書長之問題。五國與會代表將爲英法荷駐比大使，盧駐比公使，及比外交部高級官員一人。</p>

<h3>東西分裂局面　將入新階段　共產勢力蔓延</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕此間觀察家稱：芳蘭代表團抵達莫斯科後，日內莫斯科之行動，將使東西對立局勢的發展進入新陛段。歐洲之分裂形勢，現已幾告完成。一方面爲參加馬歇爾援助方案之各國，一方面爲附和蘇聯反對馬歇爾方案之諸國。共產勢力之發展，數年來已有突飛猛進之成績，戰前在波南保匃羅捷及阿爾巴尼亞諸東歐國家僅有共產黨員十六萬人，今日已達六百萬人。共黨所控制之東歐七國政府管轄人民九千萬。在遠東方面，中國共黨戰前僅七十萬人，今已達二百萬人，而北韓共黨人復號稱有一千萬之衆。一九四七年底共黨復有共產情報局之設，總部設在貝爾格勒，近傳在哈爾濱雪梨亦已有共產情報局之設，此項機構之設立，與馬歇爾方案之逐漸具體化，適相吻合。行見東西勢力之衝突將更見尖銳化。</p>
<h3>德民選政府　今冬可成立</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林二十日電〕此間人土，料，基於自由選舉而產生的德國政府，可望在今年冬季成立，如能獲得蘇聯之同意，此一政府將爲整個德國的政府，不然亦將爲西德的德國政府。此間相信英美法三國在倫敦開會討論德國問題時，業已暫時議定恢復德國政府之原則，惟同時將制定佔領辦法，以規定德人及佔領國之權利及義務。此間人士甚盼在三强於四月間恢復會商時，可以確定該一臨時協定，而決定舉行德國直接民選之時間表。此間英美官員皆認根據國際法及佔領法則，迅速成立民選的德國政府，並使其參加歐洲復興方案，為對於共黨對德所採攻勢最好的答覆·此間並認西讓各採取肯定的政策，已不必因共黨之「反對德國分裂」宣傳而有所畏懼。蓋蘇聯主動的「德國人民求取統一及合理和平大會」之宣傳，在西德已完全失敗故也。</p>

<h3>盟國對德管制會開會　蘇代表中途退席　不啻宣告共管制已結束　此項行動顯係出於預定計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林二十日電〕索柯洛夫斯基元帥率領之蘇聯代表圑，於崇柯洛夫斯基表示「余覺繼續舉行此一會議已無意義」後，即退出今日之四强盟管會會議·崇柯洛夫斯基在退出前並曰，「西方國家之行動，證明彼等已破壞管制德國之協定，因而證實盟國管制委員會已不復爲四國實施管制之機構」。崇柯洛夫斯基退出後，即由美軍總司令克萊將軍就主席位，由英美法三國代表續繼會談，當議決盟管會下次開會日期，容後再行決定。英發言人事後表示，尚無理由可以相信下次會議不致舉行。　今日盟管會開會之初，蘇代表建議討論捷波南三國外長於二月十八日在普拉格開會通過之決議。英軍總司令羅勃森在法美兩國附議下，聲明普拉格之決議案旣係由政府水準提出，不宜在盟管會中討論。索柯洛夫斯基當表示西方盟國旣不願討論德國三鄰邦所提出之重要事務，顯見西方盟國已不復視盟管會爲管制被佔領德國之機構。渠並指責西方國家利用盟管會，作爲掩飾其行動的烟幕。索柯洛夫斯基聲明西方國家旣拒絕討論，渠將撤回「普拉格之決議案」後，復抨擊英美法在倫敦舉行之德國問題會談，指責三强於事先旣不通知盟管會，事後復使開會情形保守秘密。羅勃森遂答以倫敦會議係臨時性會談，僅向各本國政府提出建議，並不成立決議，俟政府成立決議後，自當通知盟管會。克萊將軍及法軍總司令寇尼許均表示贊同羅勃森之意見。於是索柯洛夫斯基乃宣讀一預先擬就的長篇聲明，謂「盟管會已不復爲四國實施管制的機構」。讀舉拂袖退出會塲，蘇代表團全體人員亦隨之退出。索柯洛夫斯基之率領全體蘇代表團退出盟管會，表示蘇聯政府已認四强之共同管制德國已告結束，德國業已肯定的分裂爲二。索柯洛夫斯基之宣讀預先擬就之聲明，更足顯示蘇聯之行動，係事先決定而非臨時採取者。　據巴黎電：負責觀察家皆認索柯洛夫斯基的行動，爲一嚴重姿態。渠之聲明「盟管會已不復爲四强管制機構，司能係宣布柏林盟管會之結束。蘇聯此等行動可以反　其因英美法三强在西德加緊團結後之惑情。　美軍總司令克萊事後被詢及索柯洛夫斯基之行動，是否即爲表示對德四强管制政府之結束時，克萊表示，並非必定如此，尚須視今後發展始能決定。另據參與盟管會之葉一美國高級外交官稱，蘇代表團之退出會俗，臘然　預定的計劃。</p>
<h3>英國謀制止危局　有人建議英蘇巨頭會晤　辛威爾盼蘇能坦白有所表示</h3>

<h3>芬蘭代表圑　啟程赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔合衆社海爾辛基廿一日電〕芬蘭代表團今日淸晨離此赴莫斯科，與蘇聯談判條約。代表專車離站時，一干非共黨人　唱國歌，一干共黨聚車站另一側，乃報之以「國際歌」一時形勢緊張，然共黨卒改隨非共黨齊唱國歌，遂告鬆弛。代表團由外長恩開爾率領，計有主要代表七人及政治軍事技術顧問多人。蘇駐芬公使沙風寗柯夫中將隨行。</p>
<h3>澳外長呼籲和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社康白拉廿一日電〕澳外長伊伐特頃向聯合國澳洲委員會發表演說表示「吾人應不惜代價，制止戰爭趨勢」。他說世界上未有負責之人有頣戰爭者，聯合國機構爲世界和平及提高生活標準的希望可在，善意之人對於世界最大的貢獻，初以全力支援聯合國世界人民有權享受基於公理的和平。接受預測有第三次大戰者的悲觀預言，即爲戰敗主義　　。</p>
<h3>美放棄聖地分治計劃後　猶人將設猶太國　馬卿承認放棄分治乃渠之主張</h3>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷二十日電〕消息靈通人士今夜稱，美國放棄巴勒斯坦分治計劃後，猶太領袖殆將立即宣布在巴勒斯坦設立希伯萊國家。猶太戰鬥部隊明白表示將用武力守住此一國家之疆界。阿刺伯人方面對於是否　續作戰，躊躇不決。惟巴勒斯坦各地，仍有阿猶零散衝突。阿剌伯軍隊司令高吉則向某記者稱：「吾人開入巴基斯坦並非討伐分治，乃計伐猶太主義。美國支援分治與否，並無關係」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴勒斯坦台拉維夫二十日電〕猶太公會牛席葛立洪今夜談稱，猶太國早巳存在，當由猶太軍防衛，唯有猶太人方能決定祖國之命運。猶太人決不接受臨時或永久的外國託管。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾二十日晚承認美國放棄巴勒斯坦分治計劃之決定，乃由渠本人擘劃者。</p>
<p>美國改變主張　聯大將受考驗</p>
<p>〔合衆社成日電〕此間美國官方與其他聯合國外交家指出，美國正在鄭軍考慮如何使其對巴勒斯坦之新建議能避免蘇聯之反對及其否決權之阻撓。美方確認爲不問蘇聯將於如何堅强之反對此新計劃必將通過，並强調新計劃中各基本原則必不致被否決權所擊敗。美國對巴勒斯坦之新計劃首先將向安理會提出。如蘇聯使用否決權時，美國可越過安理會以達到其目的。如蘇聯否決安理會之召集聯合國大會時，美國即準備由五十七國之多數國建議召開特別會議。然由安理會召開大會能節省時間，而目前時間之因素甚爲重要，蓋英國之委治將於五月十五日結束也。英國官方雖一再聲言委洽必將於五月十五日結束，然此間仍希望英軍能暫緩撤退，以待美國托管計劃之能通過實施。聯合國官方深懼取消分治計劃更將减低聯合國之威信。咸權方面認爲巴勒斯坦問題以及捷克之科紛，或將使聯合國成為西方各國直接反蘇之集團。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕美國政府提議　　巴基斯坦分治案，其動機有二：（一）這免美蘇兩國軍隊同時派往巴勒斯坦執行警衛任務；（二）顧全美國在阿剌伯各國之油權。</p>
<p>英方本願更改　聖地撤軍決心</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦衆電〕官方宣稱：英國將不顧美國放棄分治計劃之決定，必於五月十五日終止其聖地委任統治權，且於八月一日撤退全部英軍。英殖民部稱：目前新形勢並不影響英國政府按期終止其委任統治權之決意。</p>
<h3>親蘇捷外長闡明　捷外交信條　以誠待誠以友易友</h3>
<p>〔路透社着拉格廿日電〕捷克外長克萊孟蒂斯發表就職以來之首次廣播演說，指　方故意發動歇斯的里的戰爭宣傳，以掩飾其他更危險的事件，如利用德國作爲對付前被德國所害者之經濟同盟及政治跳板等。克氏稱，安理會之受理智利之控訴蘇聯壓迫捷克政府接受共黨要求，實爲可恥。最後渠並表示，捷克之外交政策將無變更，仍爲「以忠實對忠實，以友誼對友誼」。</p>

<h3>摒棄煩惱心理　努力必能成功　程天放講「煩惱與希望」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕程天放博士昨晨十時應華山路清年館學術講座之請，演講「煩惱與希望」，剖解靑年煩惱心理之成因，解釋此種心之不必要，並勗勉靑年努力前途。茲誌其演詞大要於後：（圖爲程天放）</p>
<p>「本人去年回國以來，所接觸到的許多靑年，普遍都有煩惱苦痛的心理。造成這種心理的原因，分析起來有兩種：一種是由於個人的，如家庭不睦，經濟困難，戀愛挫折等等，另一種是田於國家社會的，因爲抗戰結束兩年半以來，國家未能獲得和平建設，反而遍地烽烟，影響到交通阻塞，經濟破產，政治腐敗，物價高漲，社會道德墮落，靑年們目睹這種情形，更感到煩惱與痛苦。</p>
<p>其實，煩惱與痛苦的心理不單是中國靑年如此，世界其他各國的靑年又何獨不然。本人在歐美所見，如英國戰後物資缺乏，冬天沒有煤生火，食物都有定量分配，一星期祗能吃到一個鷄蛋。如法國，因爲市接受到戰爭的損害，物資較英國更爲缺乏。如德國，戰敗後在別人的管制之下，當然更不用說。如蘇聯，市面上乞丐很多，人民生活也很苦。又如美國，儘管物資生活還能保持戰前水準，但精神上也是不安，因爲戰後共產主義一天天擴張蔓延，第三次世界大戰說不定什麽時候就會發生，他們隨時都在提心吊胆。所以說起來，世界各國的靑年都有他們的痛苦與煩惱。　可是，我們切不可太煩惱而走上悲觀的道路，　結果祇　　殺。我們應該相信什麼事都有希望，前途都有光明。</p>

<p>以個人的煩惱來說，我們相信祗要目己有決心，肯努力，不論環境如何困難，必有解決成功的希望。古今中外這一種先例甚多，如美國總統林肯，他幼時環境極壞，家人住在太棚內，他六七歲時就工作，沒有機會進學校，可是他利用工作的餘暇努力自修，終於獲得豐富的學問智識而做到美國總統。又如大科學家愛迪生，他的家庭也非常窮困，他十幾歲陸在火車上做侍老，等乘客睡了就在車上做化學實驗，在這樣的環境之下自己努力硏究，後來竟發明了八百冬種的科學器具，造福於人類。又如我們的領袖蔣主席，他小時候環境也不好，八歲就喪父，留下孤兒寡婦，生活困難，但是他不灰心，不喪志，終於成就後來的事業。所以不論環境如何困苦，祗要把眼光放遠大，不因小事而彷徨失望，而以畢生事業作目標，努力奮鬥，一定能有成就。</p>
<p>國家雖紊亂　前途仍有望</p>
<p>以整個國家局勢來講，儘管目前情形紊亂，但前途仍舊光明有希望·這從幾件事可以看出來：第一，目前我們在國際上的地位是百年來所沒有的，外人在中國的特權已完全取消。第二，我們在各方面的進步雖較他國爲慢，但較之四五十年前確已進步得多。在四五十年以前，我國民智非常幼稚，例如看到外國人西裝褲子筆挺就以爲外國人的腿是直的，又譬如懼怕攝影，以爲這是外國人來攝取靈魂，這種想法現在看來眞是非常可笑。在組織能力方面，現在也已進步得多，從前所謂「衙門」的用處一是打官司，二是完錢糧，除此之外，與人民可以說毫無關係。現在我們較之其他國家雖尚落後，但至少組織已完備了。第三，共產主義雖然在擴大蔓延，但最後必不會成功。因爲共產主義者野蠜殘酷，到處實行殘殺政策，而且遠反人性，甚至令子殺父，妻殺共夫，弟殺其兄。這種主義不合於我們的國情，更不會得到人民的同情，故則使目前勢力膨漲，最後必歸於消滅。　再以中國歷史來說，過去歷代混亂的情形更有甚於目前者，如晋末五胡之亂，唐末五代之亂，明末流寇之亂，無不全國騷然，社會動盪，但到後來必仍恢復繁榮，重上軌道。所以祗要我們自己努力，在政治經濟上加以改善，最短期內必有光明的道路。</p>
<h3>民主國家　必獲勝利</h3>
<p>世界的局勢也是如此。共產主義與民主國家鬥爭之結果，相信勝利必屬於後者。過去因民主國家間不能團結，所以坐令共產主義日益擴大，但最近歐洲國家已在團結起來，如英法荷比盧森堡訂立之互助條約，又如西歐十六國在巴黎召開之經濟會議，均爲祇禦蘇聯的侵略。美國方而對於共產主義的認識已很淸楚，爲防禦共產主義，而對於別國的援助也已一天天加强，所以整個世界亦光明在望。</p>
<p>最後值得提出的是科學進步，人類前途有無限的希望。近五十年來人類科學的巡步，遠勝於渦去五千年的成就。而未來五十年的進步相信更甚於現在的五十年。尤其是這次大戰中發現的原十能，相信不出十年至十五年的時間，必能應用於工業上而使人類生活大大地改善。據科學家估計，將來人類每天祗要做四小時的工作，就能够維持生活了。所以無論從個人從國家從世界從人類的前途來看，前途都是光明燦爛。生在二十世紀的靑年實在是非常値得羨慕的，希望大家能摒棄煩憫的心理，而充份利用這難得的機會　。</p>

<h3>緬甸掇拾</h3>
<p>〔本報仰光十四日航訊〕記者團這一次承中航公司的協助，從上海去到仰光，不僅在氣候上像走進了另一個世界，在生活上所看到與體味到的也是逈然不同的異國情調。</p>
<p>特別飯菜</p>
<p>到仰光的第五天，一位華僑請我們到他家中吃緬甸飯，這是我們第一次嘗到緬甸風味。緬甸菜在形式上與中國菜很相近，可是烹調的滋味大大不同。它的特點是主辣，油膩，另外有一股說不出的腥味，我們記者團中有幾位同業居然能吃得津津有味，我與另外幾位可就覺得很難於下咽，但礙於主人的情面，祗好勉强吃一些敷衍。隔了一天，緬甸外交部長請我們到他官邸裏吃晚飯，在他是對於我國記者團的一番盛意，在我們則又是一件苦事。那大的菜在緬甸算是非常豐盛的了，却較之前一天華僑家裏的更難吃。</p>
<p>抓喫東西</p>
<p>我們爲維持外交禮貌，硬了頭皮吃下去，而且還必須抑制厭惡的表示，好容易把菜與飯吃過了，侍者却又提上來一小碟子雜拌兒，裏面有薑絲·芝蔴·花生米·和油炸的細麵條，大家用手拌和了抓來吃。（緬甸人吃東西像印度人一樣，都用手抓，宴請我們時，飯菜總算用刀叉，這雜拌兒却必須用手了。）這還不算，最後那位外交部長爲表示尊敬客人，特別又拿出一碟子醃茶葉來介紹。這種茶葉被醃成黑黑的像菜乾一樣，在他們認爲是無上的美味。那天涂允壇大使也在座，而且就坐在緬甸外交部長的隔鄰，我看他也是勉强在領受，把幾片茶葉抓了又抓，好久才送進口裏。最有趣的是一位同業，他吃得已快要吐出來，口頭上却還大說其外交詞令。迎說「很好很好！簡直與中國菜差不多。」等到飯畢告辭出來，一坐進汽車，這才大呼「硬傷！」「硬傷！」</p>
<p>上下服裝</p>
<p>緬甸人穿的服裝分上下兩截，下半身無論男女都裹紗籠，就是以一方衣料對折縫好，像一個籠子一樣的套進下半身，腰間則打結紥牢。上半身女人穿的是薄紗長袖衣，裹得極緊，可以看見裏面遮掩胸背的小馬甲。男人平常穿的像西裝襯衫一樣，遇到正式集曾或儀典時，則在外面加一件白色的馬褂，頭上並用紅紅綠綠的布巾裏住，在右邊打一個結。這種頭部裝束頗使人想起我國武俠小說或傳奇中的綠林人物。</p>
<p>緬甸女人</p>
<p>記得美國電影片中有一張桃樂珊拉摩主演的「緬甸風月」，使看過的人對緬甸大爲神往，連帶的對緬甸人發生無限綺思。然而我們在仰光看到的緬甸女人却都是醜陋不堪。她們臉上差不多每個人都用一種樹皮粉搽得像石灰一樣，據說這種樹皮粉有淸涼的作用。她們的身材都很矮小，面部輪廓够不上美的條件，如果勉强說來，唯一的可取之點就在於紗籠裹得緊，所以腰身很細，曲綫還分明。</p>
<p>住屋一瞥</p>
<p>仰光因爲氣候潮濕，緬甸人住屋的地板大都離地面有相當距離，更有些房屋用柱子憑空撑起，整個祗有樓上一層，上下的樓梯裝在屋外。緬甸人貧窮的佔多數，他們的住屋都是破陋不堪的木棚草房。至於有錢的緬甸人或政府官員所住的則是有最新式設備的西式洋房。</p>
<p>大小金塔</p>
<p>緬甸是佛敎之國，雖然佛敎勢力近來已在走下坡路，但仰光街上仍隨時可見披了紅黃袈裟的僧侶，而緬甸風物中最聞名遐邇的就是佛敎聖地的金塔。仰光市內有大小金塔各一，內除各種佛像以外，大金塔內另有各式各樣尖頂的小塔。任何人在進金塔之前必須脫鞋，否則緬甸人認爲褻凟神靈，必羣起而攻之。可是金塔裏面步登的石級甚爲齷齪，我們脫鞋環遊一圈後出來，一雙襪底上滿是鳥糞與汚泥。</p>
<p>車輛警察</p>
<p>仰光市內烏鴉特別多，早晚都噪個不停，市區內則電影院很多。除此之外，有兩種東西比較特殊，一種是三輪車，與上海的不同，是在脚踏車的後輪右旁裝座位與另外一輪，座位一前一後，可以相背而坐兩人。另一種是十字路口的交通警察，他們指揮交通時雙手飛舞，對每一輛汽車都個別指揮，所以一息都不停，其手勢着起來很滑稽，但能够歷久而不疲倦，顯得他們都曾經歷了一番訓練！</p>
<p>總統府裏</p>
<p>我們在離開仰光的前一天中午，曾經去覲見緬甸總統沙維坦。總統在一間很小的辦公室內接見我們，他穿了西服，這一套西服，敝舊的程度好像是從上海吳淞路上賣出的一樣。他本來是由族的酋長，到過雲南，能够說雲南話。可是他推說忘了，與我們談話時用不容易使人聽得懂的英語。我們坐了約十分鐘就告辭出來。據說這一位總統有四個妻子，可是緬甸人在選他做總統時提出一個條件，祗許他帶一位太太住進總統府，所以現在跟他一起住的祗有他的第三太太。我們感覺到他在總統府裏的生活似乎也是非常寂寞的。（本報記者袁文中）</p>

<h3>準備出席中研院評議會　胡適昨由平飛抵滬　李書華李宗恩同機南來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北大校長胡適，北平硏究院院長李書舉，協和醫學院長李宗恩三人，聯袂乘空中覇王號，於昨日下午六時一刻，由平飛抵滬。胡氏將在滬主持二十四日召開之協和醫學院董事會，會後偕李書華乘車晋京，參加二十五日在京舉行之中央硏究院院士第二次評議會，選舉該院有届院士一百人。評議會結束後，即留京出席國民代表大會。</p>

<h3>一般物價　週初走勢平穩　週末波動又烈</h3>
<p>上週是陰曆年關過後第五週。年關過後物價波動之猛，眞是前所未見。論此次物價大波動週期中物價指數上升之巨，僅三十五年春季漲風上升百分之百二十差可比擬。但那次漲風是因爲勝利後內遷工廠尚在東歸途中，沿海一帶生產尚未恢復常態，而戰時內遷人口大量東歸，沿海一帶消費量急遽增加，同時法幣又由內地大量東流，造成一次猛烈物價漲風。那次物價大波動週期中一般物價指數的上升雖在百分之百以上，但歷時則達十二週之久。這是一次比較例外的彼動。從那次以後，民國三十五年後半年尚有一次大波動，民國三十六年有過三次大波動。這四次大波動中物價總指數上升百分比自百分之四十二到百分之八十。波動週期從十二週縮短到六週，每二週期中間的間歇時間也逐漸自三個月縮短到五週或六週。最近這一次陰曆年關後短短三週內物價總指數上升已經超過百分之百。到前週即第四週，糧食價格稍稍回落，燃料價格仍舊平穩，但紡織品依然突飛猛進，並無進入間歇時期的象徵。到上週物價又大都繼續突飛猛晋，好似這一次物價大波動尚未結束，而到結束時這一週期中物價總指數上升的百分比總共上升多少，尚在不可知之數。這是過去各次物價波動週期所未見的現象，這種現象的嚴重程度確是前所未有。値得金融當局特別注意。</p>
<p>返顧金融當局對這一嚴重局面的應急措施如何。爲鼓勵出口而四聯總處上週擬定出口物資結匯貸款辦法，這和生產貸款同樣將有影響於銀根之鬆動。爲輸入限額分配中之工業原料及生產工具之輸入量不能滿足工業界一般之需要，上週據財政部權成人士談話，政府原則上已同意短期內開放自備外匯。但以此項自備外匯輸人之外貨以工業生產工具爲限。這一項決定之將要刺激黑市外匯，可能性似屬甚大。再者，紗管會成立以來三月有餘，對代紡代織實施辦法，迄未見公佈施行，而對紗廠所需原棉則先實施統購統銷，嚴禁紗廠自行收購，以致紗廠存棉，日見短缺，造成原棉奇缺之嚴重現象。以上各項辦法似乎對物價之平抑均未表現實際功效，尤其紗布市塲之漲價限制，上週四甫經規定每日上漲不得超過上日收市價百分之五，而甫行二日，又因事實上無法實行而放寬限度。在當前原棉存底日薄之局面下，紗布漲風之猛烈，恐非政府此類硬性規定所能收效。再如上週四聯總處通過提高存款利率以平抑物價，此項設施是否能達到預期效果，亦頗有疑問。照威克塞爾等一般瑞典經濟學者之理論，爲維持物價之平穩，市塲利率應提高到所謂均衡利率或中和利率之水準。目前行莊存款利率遠低於威克塞爾之均衡利率固無疑問，但在通貨膨脹狀態下均衡利率實爲變動不定之數字。若提高存款利率以平抑物價，其結果恐將與目前提高外匯牌便以求消滅外匯黑市收效之微相類，結果恐存款利率愈提高，物價漲風愈加速，亦即均衡利率愈高升，前者終不能追上後者。况目前均衡利率已超過按月百分之百，存款利率亦無法提到如此高度。故以上各項辦法均値得從新檢</p>
<p>上週因前週本市物價上升過猛，高出內地甚巨，游資大量內流購貨　以漢口，重慶，昆明爲多，此點可於上述各地匯率之升高見之。上週一本市銀根帶緊，行局差進六千一百餘億，尤爲罕見之高峯。食糧經前週末之跌勢，挫落更甚。但紗布市塲買氣重振，價再上升，週二週三緊勢未鬆，食糧再降，紗布在週二略挫，但週三下午緊勢稍鬆，紗布重復上升。此後無論食糧，紗布，人絲，廠經，無不日創新高價，週末漲勢更狂，上述各貨市塲均陷瘋狂狀態。白粳每石自前週末三一百四十五萬至上週末升達四百十五萬。門售竟至四百四十萬。兵船麥粉每袋自前週末一百四十三萬至上週來升達一百五十九萬。漲勢更狂者當推紗布，同期四十二支藍鳳，自一億七千七百萬升達二億二千七百萬，龍頭細布每四自三百三十九萬升達四百四十萬。但因週初週中價格較低，故上週物價指數比前週上升並不甚巨，糧食指數反見下落洛，其原因乃因本會所編物價指數僅包括週一至週五五日，因編製時間閘係，並不包括週六在內。其他如煤斤因天時日暖，需用减少，價格最穩，焦作坡煤穩定於每噸一千三百萬左右，六九三硫化元亦因時令關係，需川較小，價穩定於每桶五千二百萬元左右，但一般化學品大抵上升甚巨。</p>

<h3>貨幤·金融　游資擁至銀根仍緊　差進減少暗息續昇</h3>
<p>上週本市銀根，本可隨國家行局交換差額的轉進爲出以及外埠游資的陸續運達面轉弛，但物價的漲勢因受各種因素的刺激依然漫無止境，即便平疲了不過三四天的糧價又告上揚，紗布因受紗廠原棉即將不繼的傳說更見昂騰，缺貨者搜羅頭寸買進，賣方寗負厚息，高價扳特，結果使一般物價未因銀根之緊俏而回跌而物價之繼續高騰，反過來促使銀根益緊，頭寸益缺，游資的匯集與行局的減進果然使燈凈油乾的市面略見滋潤。但一週來商業行莊，缺單普遍，每日以現鈔解交央行以抵補單子者，除週一之一千多億外，每日不過數百億，同業拆放，亦不太容易。票據交換所中退票增加，雖可敷塞窘况於一時，然究非永久之計，於是不得不乞援於業外的零星頭寸。結果，使上週暗息盤旋於三角之上，經久不跌。證劵套利亦高坐三角的高盤，週五證劵帮多空貼息，亦達三角九分的空前高額。</p>
<p>上週國家行局的交換差額，除週一差進四千四百六十九億稍鉅外，週二之窗際差進不過二百八十五億，微不足道，週三至週五幾天，扣除商業銀行於央行之定存外，每天均有百億以上的眞實差出，這與前兩週國家行局的差進情形比，眞不能同一而語。國家行局之差進額雖减少，但商業行莊間接交換組之總出數却仍在一萬五千億左右，銀根之緊，亦可槪見。　上週洋商銀行的交換情形，除週二表現爲五百八十五億之差出，創二月來出數之記錄外，其他各天都有鉅額之差進，週三至週五之差進額，日在一千二三百億，資金的南逃，據說依然劇烈。</p>
<p>內外滙率</p>
<p>上週外匯行情，基準率於週三又見掛高，美匯核定爲每美元合國幣二十五萬五千元，增加率約爲百分之三十，英美套匯率未動，英匯每磅合國幣七十六萬五千元，香港申匯亦續見報縮，週一法幣十萬合港幣一元二角二分，週四已縮至一元一角三分，美鈔市價週一合港幣五元七角七分，週四縮至五元五六角左右。　上週本市商業銀行內匯率波動頗劇，穗匯週一爲每千元二百元，週五亦爲二百八十元，厦匯週一爲二百元，週四週五上升至三百，漢匯亦自週一之九十元晋升至週三四之一百廿元，渝匯最高爲週二之七十元最低爲週四之四十元，一般說來，各地匯水普見升勢，原因不外，資金繼續南流，及各地申匯貼水减少。津匯貼水上週頗有增加，當與北方游資南流有關。</p>
<p>華洋股市</p>
<p>上週華股行市，固受銀根緊斂之影響，但因市場游資紛紛匯集，外象利買，故一般說來，仍普現好面。例如就週一而言，國家行局，雖有巨額差進，但中泥等九種仍達漲限。此外上週港匯續縮及紗價的猛躍，均曾予華股以新刺激，其間如永紗前週週末以一四二八元收盤，上週週末之收價爲一八六〇元約增百分之三十，其他景福景綸同期內的漲率均約三成，新光爲二成，大型股如美亞上週週五以三千四百元收盤，較前週週末收價亦漲百分之三十弱。</p>
<p>外股上週走勢不及華股，據說因香港價格與本市柜差甚鉅，其問頗多以股票運往本地銷售，致本市喊價不高；如怡紗前週週末為一百八十五萬上週末為一九六萬，約漲百分之六，其他怡　，英聯會德豐同期內之漲率均在半成以下，與前週之漲率相差頗多。</p>

<h3>工商動態</h3>
<p>原料「恐慌」</p>
<p>在整個工業界普遍凋零的今天，紡織工業總算尚維持着一個小康的局面，但隨着年月的推移，該業同樣亦已陷入四面楚歌的窘境中了！如所週知，日本的紡織工業，在美國倍加扶植下，已經作邁步的重建，中國紡織學會，爲此特於本月十一日召集一座談會，專討論一美國扶植日本紡織工業」問題，結論認爲日本紡織工業之重建，應以供給其本國需要之三百五十萬錠爲限量，同時認爲中國政府當局，應鼓勵紡織工業之利潤所得，大量用之於紡織工業之建設與發展上，若徒限於財政收入，不啻爲殺鷄取卵之政策云云。但事寳已是非常昭著「美人置同盟中國民族工業之前途於不顧」乃其「現行國策之一環」，據新亞社東京十六日電訊，大阪紡織同業公會就本年度輸出棉布之生產計劃與棉布工業聯盟開會商討，決定本年度之生產目標爲九億五千五百十萬七千碼，據悉，在亞洲運銷之對象中，我國亦被列其中，於是希望的重心，不得不寄託於「自力更生爲已任」上面，但一週以來，由於代紡代織的延未實施，造成紡織業原料的極度恐慌，六區棉紡公會，全國紡織工業聯合會先後召集會議，商討對策，據悉本市各廠所存原棉，最多不過兩個月，最少僅够二三星期之需。又據紡織界某權威人士稱，此種情况若不速予設法，各廠即有停工之虞，本市紗廠員工達九萬人左右，加以紗廠有關之複製業，五金業等員工爲數頗巨，一旦紗廠停工，影響治安必甚嚴重。又據渠謂，目前紗布猛漲，亦以紗廠存棉枯竭，業外人羣起搶購所致。棉紡業此外更向當局呼籲，要求外銷委員會立即以紗向國外交換印棉二十萬包，否則由六區公會自動辦理，因印度政府已頒佈截至三月底爲止，開始禁止印棉出口。的確，問題是巳經逼到非解決不可的時候了。　處境的困難，在每一個角落都是非常普遍的，除棉紡工業以外，全國水泥工業同業工會，爲展開水泥外銷，亦曾於上週籲請政府全面協助，據悉在現訂匯率之下，如將國外所售價格折合法幣尚不敷成本二分之一，如以菲列濱之情形爲例，該地美貨水泥每五十公斤紙包計售美金二元，按最近匯價予以結算，祗得國幣三十九萬元，而目下國產出口每包成本已達五十五萬元，再加保險裝卸以及滬菲間之巨額運費，根本無法與人競爭故該業要求水泥外銷所得外匯，應全部撥歸出口廠商，作爲訂購器材及轍入石膏紙袋等原料之用。此種請求，固與風傳一時的自備外匯開放問題相配合，而輸管會所擬之自備外匯購進生產器材一節，又據說全爲增加國內生產並以不刺激黑市爲原則，舉凡一般國外私人亦款，國內私人之外幣及黃金均非開放之對象，則「此事關係自甚複雜」，如當局對獲取外匯頭寸的慾望稍稍抑制，恐亦不難「愼重研究」與「獲致協議」吧！</p>
<p>工業產品的價格，週來除棉紗布的漲勢驚人以外，肥皂價格的增漲率亦屬空前，據四區肥皂工業同業公會說明肥皂猛漲的原因有二：一爲製造原料高漲，如牛油去年農曆年底每担爲四百萬元現已逾一千六百萬元，漲四倍有餘，同時傳說第四季油脂臘限額將减少。再如椰子油亦飛漲，農曆年底每担爲六百萬元，迄今已漲至二千三百萬元。第二個原因爲資金週轉困難，生產萎縮，出品减少，自然價格猛漲。顯然這是一切工業部門所遭到相同的難題，然而這個難題，決不是用一物漲價因爲是另一物也漲價的循環公式所能解答，換句話說，物價的普遍上漲，決不是普遍平抑物價所能達到目的的。</p>
<p>「收購」桐油</p>
<p>關於出口物資收購事宜，其對象原限於桐油猪鬃，生絲，大豆，蛋類，羊毛等七種重要物品，上週先試辦桐油一種，據說由於桐油國外價格下跌較烈，已至非收購不可之境地之故。收購重要出口物資審價委員會，已於十三日成立，收購地區以滬穗梧州處爲限，規定並不到內地收購，免與商民爭利云云。據悉中信局收購出口商申請之桐油已達三百噸另據中信局發言人談此項辦法之實施，可帮助出口物資大量外銷，不受外匯率的限制。</p>
<p>此外，爲配合當局鼓勵廠商輸出的措施，本市十家國貨廠商，聯合成立一外銷機構，爲推廣輸出，從事努力自然，廠商在國內原料缺乏，生產成本激增，出品產量銳减的困境下，如能在國外市塲上找點出路，亦不無小補。但當局與廠商方面的種種措施，究竟其實效和何？見仁見智，看法頗多差別。據匯　銀行總經理談：中國海外貿易雖被置於管制之下，但因通貨膨脹的關係，鼓勵輸出，减少輸入，是否有效，殊屬疑問云云。</p>
<p>農貸的「使命」</p>
<p>工業貸款的是否開放，尚在夜長夢多之時，農業貸款却已有了具體的眉目，而在數量方面，後者亦佔了上風。據農行農貸處喬處長表示，本年度糧食貸款爲五萬億，棉花貸款爲三萬億，共佔全部貸款數字的百分之六十，據說這筆數字雖龐大，但我土地之廣，欲求其普遍，仍不可能，故本年特採重點主義，擬集中辦理。關於農貸今後之成就，喬氏一再强調要健全農民組織，農貸始能得受實惠。農貸固以農民爲對象，但據說農民漫無組織，款項無法放出，故必須通過合作社及鄉農會，農民必先加入合作社爲社員或加入鄉農會爲會員，才能貸給云云。</p>
<p>同時為避免中農各地分行各地合作金庫有衝突處，農貸地區將以農民銀行爲主，合作金庫則補助其不及貸放之地區。再在同一地區之中，如同時有中農及中央合作金庫之機構存在者，彼此仍劃分勢力範圍，即有關合作方面之放款，悉由中合辦理，而本年度農貸計劃中，明白規定爲合作貸款者亦歸中合庫負責放款。又本月十九日，爲檢討過去，策劃將來，中農行特舉行行務會議，董事長陳果夫等均發言，認爲農貸工作負有協助政府爭取民衆之責任，由此可見，本年度佔貸款總額百分之六十的農貸，是負有不平凡的使命的。</p>
<p>工商調查</p>
<h3>絲織工業之產銷問題</h3>
<p>我國生絲及絲織品，向爲重要出口貨。戰前出口商品中，其出口價値常佔第一位。出口總額平均每年達十五萬公擔之鉅，計値在法幣一千五百萬元左右，約當同時期平均出口總値百分之十四，可抵補同時期平均進口總値百分之十。勝利後因各廠均蒙受損失，未能全部復元。上海現僅有絲織廠三百九十一家，共有織機六千五百餘台，如原料及資金能充分供應，每月產量可達八萬疋。國內所產生絲以供織造，尚虞不足。且各絲織廠已於戰時習於用人造絲，一時積重難返。去歲曾由日本輸入少量之人造絲。本年初又由意大利運到一千五百餘箱，上海，杭州，無錫等地絲織業，均於本週總得配給。惟以幣値貶落，成本高昂，產製頗感艱苦。最近盟軍總部決定恢復日本生產，日本所存原料極多，人造絲織品旣價廉而物美，現已在美國紐約市塲傾銷。每磅日本絲由現價七美元五角五分，减至二美元五角五分，遂使美國市塲不再消納昂貴之我國生絲。我國絲之運銷對象，原以美國爲主，令迫不得已已轉以印爲主，然因我國生產費高昂之故，輸至印度孟買者，祗售出百分之五，其餘仍滯留在印枝房中。又美國戰後尼龍生產，亦爲减少我國絲需要原因之一。</p>
<p>近來因政府對蠶絲加以統制，俾能管理外匯。但廠商甚盛不滿，遂致生產興趣减少。出口絲量，更形低落，去年度生絲及絲織品輸出總量二一·八六〇·七一公擔總値僅三五九·一五九·四三八·〇〇〇元其出口價値已不逮桐油，豬鬃，棉織品之類遠甚。又以華北華東方面戰火威脅，紛紛籌謀南遷。於是廣東順德等地之蠶絲，遂獲中　公司之注意，該公可不但擬積極推廣改良蠶種，並在粤省　設絲廠織造。同時中國農民銀行之蠶種貸款，亦於本週開始辦理，月息最高七分，時期以六個月或九個月爲一期，當裨益絲織業非淺云。由此觀之，今後之絲織工業，或將以粤省爲中心，就近輸出香港及澳門，再轉運歐美應用。歐洲比瑞英法意等國，亦屬我國絲主要消費市塲也。</p>

<h3>原子時代的玻璃</h3>
<p>— 王傳議</p>
<p>在這次世界大戰的早期，軍事專家想利用玻璃以製造一種透明而能掩蔽敵人耳目的飛機，這個計劃雖未能實現，但因其特强之硬度，玻璃已被廣泛地使用在飛機上，汽車上，以及殘廢者的假手足，防彈坎肩，外科醫生所需的繃帶，和蛀齒的塡充物等，玻璃還能製造爲肥料。玻璃這一新進工業，正以日進千里的姿態，出現於各種製造品中。一個規模較大的玻璃廠能出產四千種不同用途的玻璃。</p>
<p>現在是玻璃時代</p>
<p>玻璃的用途日廣，故美國的玻璃專家誇言人類經石器時代，銅器時代，鋼器時代後，現正踏人玻璃時代？在畢茲堡大學（Pittshburgh）所召開之玻璃改進會，其主席西弗曼博士（Dr．Alexander　Silvermen）預言在最近的五年內，玻璃業將成爲一最重要的輕工業。</p>
<p>玻璃可以抵禦原子炸彈</p>
<p>西弗曼博士並作一驚人的宣言，便是用原子炸彈原料—鈾—所製成的一種特殊玻璃，能抵禦由原子炸彈所發出的可怕的輻射。他稱：「人們在原子炸彈爆發區域中，若穿上用此種玻璃所織成的盔甲，並載以特製的氣氣筒，內裝有一用玻璃絕緣的高頻率濾塵器，能防止放射性的灰塵以保護生命的安全。</p>
<p>玻璃和塑料</p>
<p>最近工業上一重要的發明，便是用玻璃纖維以增强塑料（Plastics）的方法之完成。這事正好像建築師用鋼條以加强三和土之堅固性，此種加以玻璃纖維的塑料含有許多金屬之特性，其輕如鋁，且具有今日吾人所用最硬金屬之強度。故現代設計家及工程師競相採用，以製飛機之機端，游艇及各種日用器具。工藝家則用此種玻璃增强的塑料以代替舊時建築所需之絕熱物料，因其含有能絕熱之特性。此種塑料且可用以製造兵士之輕便防彈坎肩。此類防彈衣在效能方面遠超過用金屬製成的防彈衣，而兵士們稱之爲「杜龍」（Doron），牠能阻擋0.45口徑之槍彈；爲精密起見，此種「杜龍」還在哥倫比亞之叢林內繼續試騐改良中。</p>
<p>玻璃纖維之新用途</p>
<p>美國軍事當局新近正實騐用玻璃纖維以織一種北極探險衣，此探險衣可用以抵禦北極零度下之冷氣候。據製造者測騐，此衣能在華氏表零下四十度保持原有之體溫。磨碎後之玻璃纖維且可用作特殊紙張之加強劑，以製留聲機唱片，或滲入顏料中以增優其質地，外科醫生並用以製造傷口之縫合綫，特製之繃帶及血漿濾淸器，農藝學家且預言在不久的將來，可以撒播一種特異的玻璃絲以作肥料。此事現由貝加博士（Dr．Alfred　Badger）及勃萊博土（Dr．Roger　H．Bray）負責担任實騐着。這種玻璃絲含有主要植物之營養素，且可溶於水及漸溶於泥土中而被植物之根部所吸收，以維持其生命。吾人相信不久玻璃將被廣泛地採用作肥田劑。</p>
<p>科學不僅告訴我們用玻璃以製各種器物的方法，且指示我們使用各種特殊的塗料以改進舊式玻璃之品質。例如塗以一種透明堅固而能傳電的塗料，以製飛機及汽車上的防風玻璃，而此種玻璃具有不結凍之特性，玻璃被認爲一種能利用的物質，開始於很久以前，但玻璃之成爲一重要工業，現仍在萌芽時代。</p>
<h3>防銹新法</h3>
<p>— 顧同高譯</p>
<p>你的自來水管子生誘了，你的銅絲篩子爛掉了，你的鋁質鍋子褪色了，還有你的刀叉等變暗了……。</p>
<p>這雖是你個人的小問題，然而也是金屬銹蝕大問題的一部分。這個大問題每年選成了億萬元的損失。</p>
<p>會有人估計過，從一八九〇年以後所生產的全部鋼鐵，其中百分之四十都已經因銹蝕而損失掉了。兩次世界大戰，發揮了無比的破壞作用，當然是造成溢種巨大損失的一個大因素。大家都很熟悉那成堆成堆的戰爭器材棄諸銹爛的一幅圖畫吧！</p>
<p>最近，科學界已動員起來，要向這個工業與進步的敵人進攻了。美國伊里諾理工大學（Illinois　Institute　of　Technology）在一九四四年十二月時就成立了一個硏究銹蝕的試驗所，那時在美國像這一類試驗所還只有它一個。</p>
<p>麻省理工大學（Massachusetts　Institute　of　Technology）以往在這方而也曾有過若干輝煌的成績，不過後來停止進行了。可是它現在又重新設立了一個銹蝕硏究試驗所，還有俄亥俄州立大學（Ohio　State　University）和李海大學（Lehigh　University））也各設立了一所，多少都仿照伊里諾理工大學的計劃。</p>
<p>此外，凱斯理工大學（CaseInstitute　of　Technology）科羅拉多大學（University　of　Colorado）和特克薩斯大學（University　of　Texas）也正在進行建立這種試驗所。</p>
<p>伊里諾理工大學的誘蝕硏究試驗所對各種各類的金屬銹蝕都加以硏究，今天它對銹蝕的克服已經作了很有價値的貢獻。它的主任是化學敎授麥唐納博士（DrHugh　J．McDonald）</p>
<p>儘可能保特鋼鐵不誘的問題，何以到最近才受到更多注意呢？一則因爲美國政府大量儲藏着的戰爭器材或許很快就將徵用。第二因爲美國的優良鐵礦像明納蘇達州（Minneota）的美薩畢山脈（Mesabi　Range）漸地要用盡了。</p>
<p>我們可以說，大多數人認爲金屬的銹蝕，尤其鋼鐵的生銹是所知最好的例子，乃是一種簡單的自然現象，在有水汽存在的地方最易發生。但是科學硏究郤告訴我們，它是多少帶些複雜性的。照麥唐納博士說來，銹蝕作用的性質是電化的（electrochemcal）</p>
<p>他拿平常手電筒電池的失效來比較而說明這一點。電池的外殼漸漸蝕耗。在這過程中電子從蝕耗的鋅殻流往外電路而回到電池中央的碳棒。如果有一道相反的電流，比電池本身稍强，加到這電池上，則由試驗的結果發見那電池的腐蝕作用便停止了。</p>
<p>旣然銹蝕是一種電化作用，那未在金屬中和在電池中一樣，也是可以防止的，只消加一道電流和生銹金屬的自然電流相反就得了。這原理已經爲人們知道了一世紀多，可是到近年爲止還不曾被正式應用過。</p>
<p>如今，這個原理的一種實際應用，可以在巨大的輸油管綫路上看到。它們的主要敵人一向就是生銹。這種綫路現在倚靠電流來保護它們的管子不銹，間歇地應用着風車或別種發電裝置在沿綫產生電流。</p>
<p>伊里諾理工大學試驗所的硏究雖然主要是對付鋼鐵的銹蝕，但其他金屬的問題也同樣地不受忽略，尤其是新的輕金屬鎂和鎂合金，因爲它們很容易生銹。</p>
<p>在這試驗所中用到的主要方法不外：</p>
<p>（一）改換表面的外層這意思就是使金屬的表面變得比金屬本身的抵抗力更强。例如，用熱的鉻酸來處理鋁就是。</p>
<p>鋼鐵中發生內力銹蝕（Stress　corrosion）乃是因爲金屬中有少量的氮存在的緣故。把金屬表面用飽和着水蒸汽的氫來處理，就可以除去氮而阻止內力銹蝕的坼裂了。</p>
<p>（二）抗銹劑　用微量的亞硝酸鈉來處理介質，如管子中的汽油，可以阻止或减慢電化作用。汽車的散熱器就可以用這種化合物來保護不誘，或者也可以用鉻酸鈉。大庫萊水閘（The　GraodCorlee　Dam）的防銹方法是每當水閘關閉時把一種抗誘劑（破璃狀的磷酸鹽）加到水管中去</p>
<p>伊里諾理工大學試驗所的傑出工作，是抗銹劑的應用和軟鋼內力誘蝕的坼裂研究。內力銹蝕的坼裂是一種特別危險的銹蝕坼裂，因爲在事先那金屬結構組織是很少有失效的跡象可見的。</p>
<p>還有一種金屬坼裂是由於結構組織中分子分離而引起的深入誘蝕，這是各種誘蝕中最最可惡的一種—費用大，危險，而且難於檢驗。它往往造成鍋爐爆炸的原因。</p>
<p>葛倫馬煦（Glenn　A．Marsh）氏發明了一種名呌脈動極化器（Prlse　Polarizer）的儀器，它應用一道電流來發見金屬中的誘爛狀態，這是一種完全新式的方法，和以前所用的方法比較，它只消幾分之一的時間就行了。</p>
<h3>新血型RH</h3>
<p>— 薛仲薰</p>
<p>一九〇〇年郞斯台納（Landsteiner）發現某種人之紅血球，置於他人血淸中，紅血球即凝結成塊。此種反應，僅某人之紅血球，注入某他人之血淸中始有之。經精密之硏究，郞斯台納發現有AB二種獨立之抗原（AggIutlnogen或Antigen），含在紅血球中，與他人血淸中之抗體（Agglutinin或Antibody）相遇，可發生凝結現象。</p>
<p>一九〇一年郞斯合納分人類之血型爲三種。德卡斯推羅及司徒里（Decastello　and　Stutli）二人於一九〇二年指出AB型亦爲血型之一種。一九〇七年强斯基（Jansdy），一九一〇年穆斯（Moss）分血型爲四類，即O．A·B及AB是也。有抗原A者，爲A血型；有抗原B者，爲B血型；同時有A及B二種抗原者，爲AB血型；無任何抗原者，爲O血型。A血型之人，無凝結A紅血球之抗體，但有凝結B血型之抗體。B血型之人，無凝結B紅血球之抗體，而有凝結A血型之抗體。AB血型之人，二種抗體皆缺。O血型之人，則同時有二種抗體。各血型中抗原與抗體之關係，如下表所示。</p>
<p>血型　紅血球中之抗原　淸血中之抗體</p>
<p>O　O　2+B</p>
<p>A　A　B（抗B）</p>
<p>B　B　2（抗A）</p>
<p>AB　A+B　無</p>
<p>血型在遺傳上，係多數相對因子（Multiple　Alleles），由父母之血型，可排算出子女之血型。各血型之因子型（Genotype）如下：</p>
<p>血型　因子型</p>
<p>O　aa</p>
<p>A　AA（或Aa）</p>
<p>B　aBaB（或aaB）</p>
<p>AB　AaB</p>
<p>上列四種血型，普通人均知之。一九四〇年郞斯台納與懷納（Landsteiner　ahd　Weiner）發現一種新血型，由於重複注射獮猿（Rhesus　monkey）之血液入兎子及豚鼠體中，而得一種免疫之血淸，此種血淸與吾人之紅血球亦可發生凝結之反應。此種新因子，自一九四一年起稱爲Rh。用四百八十個白種人試驗，發見百分之八十五有Rh，祗有百分之十五發生負的現象。一九四一年雷文·伏其爾·凱脫辛·及蒲漢（Levine．Vogel，Katzin　and　Burnham）用一千零三十五人作大規模試驗，祗有百分之十四發生負的現象。在一百十三個黑人中，祗有九人發生Rh負的反應，約等於百分之八。一九四二年郞司台納·懷納及滿脫孫（Landsteiner，Weiner　and　Matson）用華盛頓州及其附近之美洲紅人作試驗，在一百二十人中祗有一人發生Rh負的反應，實際上每一紅人均有Rh因Rhgene）。</p>
<p>關於Rh血型之遺傳，曾用六十個白種家庭中二百三十七個孩童作試驗，發見Rh爲顯性。故從此項血型而言，因子型可分爲RhRh，Rhrh及rhrh三類。雷司·推羅·卡發爾及麥克法倫（Race，Taylor，Cappell　and　McFarlane（在一九四四年指出Rh相對因子（Rh　alleles）有Rho，Rhl，Rh2，Rh＇，Rh＂與Rhy七種。</p>
<p>因Rh血型之抗原在某人之血淸中，可引起一種抗體使紅血球凝結，故醫師輸血時對於此點宜加重視。</p>
<h3>防止害蟲的新方法</h3>
<p>— 周光宇</p>
<p>終歲勤勞的農民們，在各據災難和壓榨交織的情况下，都有着一種慘痛的經騐，就是耕作的年代愈長便愈得和更多的害蟲爭自。即有千百種歷史悠久和新穎的殺蟲劑，也還不曾解脫了他們的痛苦，所以有些專家便不得不在殺蟲劃之外來另關解決的途徑。</p>
<p>美國密蘇里州農業試驗塲最近發現在昆蟲數目和土壤肥度問有着直接關係—肥度愈小昆蟲愈多。在耕作不當，肥力曾被冲刷之土壤所生缺乏某種重要養分的作物，對於人畜的食用價値固然很小，但對昆蟲却極富吸引力，而且昆蟲也發現這種作物就是繁衍種族的理想食料。這種現象如和產於沃壤的飼料纔能製成家畜優美口糧的事實來作比較，實在有點謊誕不經，然而牠却是個千眞萬確的事實。</p>
<p>昆蟲對飼料裏的維他命或其他維持健康因素的反應，並不盡和高等動物相同，每種昆蟲都有其個別特殊需要的養分，若强使鋸末裏，生，長的昆蟲改食營養豐富的肉類或水菓便會餓死。即在蚜蟲之間，一種是必需富於氮素的食料，另一種則非有碳水化物的食物不能生活。</p>
<p>專家們根據這些啓示，近年來在土壤狀况和昆蟲方面進行的研究，己有了對重要作物害蟲發動新攻勢的趨向，譬如以侵食玉米的長椿象（Chinch　Bug）爲例，早在一八五〇年密西西比盆地的農業開始發達以後，每隔十幾年便釀成一次嚴重的災害，倘在蟲災的夏季到玉米田裏巡視一番，便可看到受害最重的部份，即在曾遭冲刷肥力極小的山坡上端—那一帶的玉米莖上都因滿佈長椿象成了赤黑兩色。在山脚下因集有冲刷來的氮素和別種之土壤元素地力極肥，那裏的玉米大都碩壯富有活力，僅在少許細弱的基幹上纔附有長椿象。先前很多人都解釋這種現象說是由於長椿象喜愛陽光和乾燥的緣故，其實中午炎熱的陽光，對牠們的吸引力並不大於對於其他昆蟲的吸引力，牠們常得躱在蔭處覓食，每遇酷夏，也只在太陽被蔽或稍凉的時刻才開始爬行，同樣的牠們在冬季常隱於草叢和浸在水裘渡過嚴冬。由此看來，長椿象在衰埀玉米上特多的原因，並非是傷光多或濕氣少的關係，而是那種玉米的液汁比山脚下肥壯玉米者更合胃口。</p>
<p>長榕象常藉富含氮素的荳科植物爬往別種作物，顯然證明牠是厭惡氮素。於是美國史東博士與赫斯曼（Dr．Stone　and　L．Haseman）便根據這種現象作了個試騐，以觀察增加氮素是否便能防止長椿象，最先田含氮量高低對長椿象的影響試騐開始，把玉米種在無養分的砂粒上，以蒸溜水濕潤，並且除掉穗苞，以免吸收株體的氮素和其他養分，然後再把這種除穗玉米，分成兩組，移植在由營養液濕潤的砂粒裏，一組的營養液富含氮素，另一組的營養液中則無氮素。當玉米正常生長的時候挖出切成小段，飼喂新孵育的長椿象。結果飼喂無氮干米的，自孵育至於終老，旺盛異常，成熟極快，且曾大量產即卵；而高氮組裏却難找到繼續進行試騐所用的足量後代。這個試騐便可設明何以在挖掘或冲刷土地使氮源减少時，長椿象的繁殖便愈旺盛。同時我們當可肯定的設，只有重新加强損失的地肥—尤其是氮素—纔能防止這種害蟲。</p>
<p>迄今爲止，他們只作了長椿象和一種土壞元素關係的研究，至於鈣氣對一般溫室牧草蟲的影響，也正準備開始試驗，我們在其他方面所見的別種例子，如樹木蛀蟲只侵蝕衰弱或將死的樹木，或牛蝨集中於贏弱不堪，營養低劣之畜體上的現象，可能也有相似　情形。</p>
<p>另一方面，却有一種與此相反的事實，就是某種害蟲（如歐洲玉米苞蟲）對生於沃壤的作物威脅較大，似在反駁前面的試驗，使人們認爲對土地施用有機肥料反而有利於害蟲。但是我們當能查出在這種土壤中一定缺乏某種元素，或因各種元素的不平衡，纔會招致這種後果。</p>
<p>當土壤裏的養分業已耗盡的時候，我們仍舊繼續耕作，則生出之對人畜無益的作物，却能促成將來發生極嚴重的蟲災，苦欲克服這種惡性循環，便應從速改造土壤的肥力，只有如此，則我們不必潛心致力對付害蟲的化學戰爭，就能更有效的防止害蟲了。</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>紙的奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 少尹</p>
<p>紙是什麽？這是一個多平淡而無意味的問題啊！你一定會發笑，覺得問的有些兒傻。隨便拿起一張報紙，或是你正在寫的信紙，就可以回答了。但是科學的發達，促成了紙的許多奇蹟，你也許未必統統曉得，且在這兒略道一下。</p>
<p>一說到紙的特性，誰都會想起它的柔弱微薄，遇到火會燒起來，碰到水就成碎片，捲動一下便會有褶痕，彈指之力即可將它洞穿。但是事實並不盡然。美國威司康新州的阿巴頓（Appleton　Wisconsin）有一幢奇異的房屋，它經過了夏季暴風雨的侵襲和三個冬季的朔風的剝蝕以後，仍然屹立不拔，這屋子完全是紙做的，地板，牆壁，屋頂無一不是紙。</p>
<p>有一位美國中西部的糧商說，有一次暴風雨將他棧房的屋頂打漏了，雨水立刻浸進裏面幾百包紙袋的糧食上，但是結果，紙袋內的食物一些也沒沾到水。</p>
<p>你以爲紙是微薄的嗎？想想在威司康新的屋子看？想想那些每小時飛行四百哩的紙飛機看。</p>
<p>你以爲紙是容易燃燒的嗎？現在甚至於烟灰盤都有用紙做的了。</p>
<p>你以爲紙是不能碰到水的嗎？想想那糧商棧房裏的紙袋吧！</p>
<p>紙學家宣稱現在距離我們穿紙衣，用紙碟，紙地毯，蓋紙被和住紙房子的時候已經不遠了。</p>
<p>這些新產品，有些已經在市塲上供應了，它們的銷路是很好的，因爲紙究竟是便宜的東西。它的主要原料是各種緊密纖維的集體，像樹，棉花莢，亞麻芽，烟根，大麻，稻稈以及某種黏土等。</p>
<p>通常孩子們的圍涎布，也有用紙做的，那些紙涎布可以吸收水份，而且價錢也很便宜，用了一次以後便可丟掉；還有一稱供給家庭主婦們用的紙餐巾，也是很實惠的，旣柔軟又不會着火，而且還可洗滌。</p>
<p>不燃紙是近代實　界的另一奇蹟，點一根火柴在不燃紙上，它會有些兒焦，但是決不致燃燒。戰時爲了適合軍用，製造了許多不燃紙，製造不燃紙的成本比普通的要貴，貴的成份就以它抵禦火力的程度爲準。普通不燃窗帷較仙宜，建造房屋用的不燃紙就較貴，至於用作衣裳的紙價錢最高，而其防火的能力，也跟普通的織物完全一樣。</p>
<p>以紙代布是達到完善的紙衣的過程中的產物。紙被單紙枕套及紙毯不久便會應運而生，其實現在　面上已經有一種野餐用的紙毯了。這種紙毯也可用作孩子的墊布和汽車的坐墊。</p>
<p>以紙代布也許可以使衣着習慣上發生改革。它可以用作只穿一次的襯衣，男子的襪子（即使最樂觀　紙品製造家，也不改相信婦女們會放棄尼龍（Nylon）以及孩子們的緊身運　衫等。</p>
<p>將來下雨時候，紙雨衣　紙帽單以及紙套鞋也會發現出來。廉價　紙外套，用　以後即可丟棄，　最會受賽家和按師們的歡迎吧！</p>
<p>現在有一種紙尿布，人們帶了孩子旅行時用它圾合宜。因此，紙品製造家便努力想出產一種柔軟而可常久使用的紙尿布，最主要的，使它價錢便宜。</p>
<p>將來，你不必爲蒼蠅蚊子的擾攘而煩燥了。只要使用一種含有DDT質料的壁紙，便可以使你的房間內二年沒事。同時DDT紙也可用來包藏毛毯和衣服之類，以防蟲蛀的侵蝕。</p>
<p>如果有人告訴你說，十四個重二百磅的人站在一張擱在二條　的紙片上，你一定會笑話他。可是事實上，一種由許多張紙黏膠而成的薄片（Lamination）的確有過這種試驗。在戰時，這種薄片的發達到了極峯。</p>
<p>因爲金屬感缺的緣故，軍品製造家使想動腦筋以紙來作爲　飛機的材料。這好像是一個妄誕的念頭，但是事實上每一方吋的薄片可以產生出二萬八千到三萬五千磅的張力，靠着這巨大的張力，薄片也可勝任爲飛機的材料。</p>
<p>在平時用作建築材料，薄片是很適合的，因爲它的重量比鋁要輕一半，比鋼只有五分之一還不到。近幾年來，紙烟斗的問世，也使紙的身價，增添不少。</p>
<p>如果你想明瞭紙的發展的過程和趨勢，可到美國阿巴頓的紙化學工廠一行。這是由一百家紙公司所合辦的大機構，裏面有成千成萬的科學家，日夜探求着紙的新用途。</p>
<p>三年以前報章上傳出了他們第一座造成的紙屋以後，全球各地都有信件寄到紙化學工廠詢問，有些好奇的人甚至親自前去參觀，這種紙屋最適宜於露營和獵夫們購用，因爲它是非常小巧輕使的，它的重量不過幾百磅，放在車上運載起來很方便，而且把它拆開來也很容易，只要化那麽一二個鐘頭就够了。</p>
<p>二十前，平均每個美國家庭每年用紙八分之一噸，一九四六年增加到三分之二噸，十年以後，大槪會超過一噸以上。照現在紙的短缺狀態看來，也有些人對將來紙的供應很表杞憂，但是紙業界已經把握到這一點，早就在加　生產了。</p>
<p>紙眞是奇異的東西，靠着科學的進步，轉瞬間，風行一時的玻璃世界恐怕要由紙世界取而代之了。這對於想過得舒服一些的窮人們，眞是福音，因爲　　旣不浪費又很實惠的呀！</p>

<h3>闢「以小見大」</h3>
<p>— 玄玄</p>
<p>最近有一種風氣，不論寫一節新聞，或是傳一個人，總歡喜在當事者的私生活上着意煊染，多寫小節，這樣的新聞或是文章寫出來，「有趣」是有趣了，「生動」是生動了，但容易引起錯誤的印象，不是失去了作者的本意，便是歪曲了被寫的對象。</p>
<p>美國的「時代」週刋在它的廿五週紀念號裏談到該刋新聞寫法的最大一個特點，便是注重「人間味」，其理由是：「一個人在偶然的談話中，有時會比在皇皇的演辭和著作中更能透露其眞意。」</p>
<p>它特別舉了一個例來說明這一點，它說十五年來描寫羅斯福的性格的文字多到不可勝數，但寫得最好的還是該刋在一九三三年羅氏初登白宮時所引的一個故事。那時羅斯福太夫人曾對「時代」的記者說過：「弗蘭克林（羅氏小名）非常歡喜命令他週圍的同伴，同伴倒也願意受他指揮。有一次我對他說：「孩子，不要常以命令給人，有時候也讓別人來發號施令一下。」他回答說：「媽，我不發命令，便沒有什麽玩的了。』」他這種性格，親者稱之爲「堅決」，仇者視之爲「專斷」，而「時代」週刊以爲這個故事最足以代表羅氏這種性格的兩面。</p>
<p>「時代」週刋這種說法其實是錯誤的，以羅斯福的豐功偉績來解釋這個故事是解釋得通的，但以這個故事來解釋羅斯福的豐功偉績却是純粹的瞎三話四。正如走江湖的算命先生，「能知過去」，往往十分可中六分，「能知未來」却是全盤胡說。做了四任總統以後，要找出他幼年時代的一些美麗的故事來是容易的，但要「由小看大」，以此例彼，便失之毫厘，差以千里了。</p>
<p>「從一個人看一個世界」，世界永遠不會看得眞切，從世界看人，則人物盡在其中矣。因此莫洛托夫打個噴嚏，與聯合國會議的前途並無關係，而馬歇爾偶然說一句不利於甲的話，便未必於乙有利。大局如何，應從大處着眼，決不是枝枝節節所能論斷。</p>
<p>新聞記者筆下的「人間味」，只是一種招徠讀者的手法，是不足爲訓的。</p>
<h3>記落鳳坡</h3>
<p>— 龍翔</p>
<p>三月十日，自由談載王百里先生「落鳳坡」一文，因憶及曾以便一遊該地，故謹就臆料所及，（蓋其時余年尚稚，自無主觀及深刻之見解與考據，純爲記述當時見聞，遺誤自亦不免也。）略述如次，聊附王先生一文驥尾，並祈指正！</p>
<p>二十九年秋，余作客於川中廣漢縣，（廣漢即三國時之錐縣，位於成都北上九十華里，爲川陝公路要道。）久已聞川陝路沿途多三國時名勝古蹟，如廣漢近郊之金雁橋，德陽羅江間之落鳳坡，以及粹潼之張飛手植柏樹，劍閣之劍門關等，心竊卿慕之。一日，適有赴羅江便車，遂先就機一遊落鳳坡。時巳深秋，山多禿林，風光到眼，遍處紅葉，更兼枝葉扶疎，西風殘照，頗具蕭素情緻。抵落鳳坡前，公路即折向西北，余等棄車步行，得小道於山壑間，拾級而上，路徑多崎崛曲折，實險要地也。半坡，一石寨題名白馬，想即白馬關，仰視山頂，簇植蒼松，翠意盎然，共秋色點綴成趣。而龐公祠在羣松間，巍露簷角，心情爲之振奮</p>
<p>比達廟，建築殊不形壯麗，左右兩三人家，各於門搭蓋香前燭茅蓬，益顯冷落意味。數道者聞客至，股勤接待，登殿，鳳雛神位在焉，黑面多鬚，頗不類文士丰度，兩廊襯以入川時諸將，半圯壞矣！乃興之所在，略事流迎辭出。</p>
<p>廟後有通羅江石徑，山勢較緩，道側豎有石碑，上　「落鳳坡」三字，作隸體，想爲後人新立、　荒草已將蕪沒矣！羣鴉爭喚晚，衰草向斜陽，數陣疏落遠鐘，憑對此一代英雄之追慕，不勝蒼凉之慨！</p>
<p>據余所知，落鳳坡確有其址，屬羅江縣境。四庫全書蜀中廣記名勝第九（川北道）亦載有：「寰宇記曰，羅江縣本廣漢涪地，晋於梓流水尾，萬安故城，因李雄之亂，移就潺亭，今城是也。西南十里，有白馬關，與鹿頭關相對。志云，山上平坦，有小徑容車馬，三國時，營壘也，其中名落鳳坡。按鳳　先生龐士元侍昭烈至此，卒於流矢下。（註一下略）」又嘉慶重修一統志載：「龐公詞，在羅江縣南十里白馬關，龐統　在焉」。不悉即王先　所指之處否？爰贅如上，以待賢者訂正。〔註：據三國志蜀志龐統傳：「進匯雊縣，統率衆攻城，爲流矢所中」則統之卒，似又在　（即廣漢），不知孰是？愚意以統卒於落鳳坡較有所據，蓋旣卒於維，當不致遠葬於落鳳坡也。姑妄誓之，以就正於高明。」</p>

<h3>領帶的啟示</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>最近我買了一條領帶，完全出於偶然的機曾。前幾天我因事途經林森中路國泰大戲院附近。一家百貨店橱窗內陳列的一長列領帶，式樣別緻，顏色鮮艷，吸住了我的目光。當時似乎嫌它定價太貴，忽怱一瞥，並無購買之意，回去以後，也就忘懷了。</p>
<p>這兩天，我從某雜誌社收到一筆稿酬，暫時沒有其他用途，就再上那家百貨店去觀光一下，凑巧這家舖子正在舉行眞絲領帶九折大减價，我在一堆花花綠綠的領帶中，好不容易的選出一條，經我要求店員讓去二萬五千元的尾數後，就欣然買了回去。</p>
<p>當時我爲什麼會選定那一條，多少憑我的直覺和下意識的支配。我回到家中，打開紙包後仔細一看，覺得領帶的設計，配色，剪裁，和質料，確能使我滿心歡喜。它的圖案中有小方格，有圓圈，有狹長條紋，有三角形，安徘得很相稱，並不是亂糟糟的一團。它的顏色有紅，有黃，有白，有藍，還點綴着不少銀色的小班點。領帶裏面，襯着羊毛的襯裏和白綢的夾裏。如果允許我說得抽象一點，它似乎可以象徵它的製造者國內的萬花筒似的生活。</p>
<p>我從這條領帶上，忽然得到一點啓示。我何以不桃選和它並列在一起，定價要便宜三分之一以上的另一條素色的領帶，我想是有原因的。人心大半歡喜複雜，而不歡喜單純。厭惡平凡而愛奇峯突出。這一條與市上領帶不同的地方打動了我的心坎。</p>
<p>我連帶想起美國作家約翰·杜·柏索氏在他寫的一篇短文中提起，人類低的慾望，須求凍餒無虞。可是由於人心愛好複雜的關係，有了吃有了穿以後，還希冀吃得好與穿得講究。</p>
<p>不但此也。人心之所好，更向多方面伸展，像一枚大章魚，獵取它所歡迎的東西。大抵人心並不以感管的享樂，以及科學，藝術與文化上的成就爲滿足，他們有愛，有進取心，有正義感，有同情與慈悲心……但是也有貪婪，驕橫，殘暴，妒嫉，冷酷等相反的心理，我們之中正有不少人，愛上電影院去看犯罪謀殺片或變態心理片，觀摩主角的酷行來塡補實生活中無從體驗的空白。假使我們眞正怕「罪惡」，像我們恐懼着「疫癘」，一鬼怪」，「黑暗」，「貧窮」，「飢餓」或「原子彈」一樣，那末，惟有奔避之不遑，誰還敢去欣賞它呢。</p>
<p>因此，我頓有所悟，世界和平並非可望而不可即的空中樓閣，如果世界上的每一個人都希望和平，和平必可立致。至今，世局仍形擾攘不安，而且世界政治舞台上的火藥氣，似乎愈來愈濃烈了。其故何在？也許因爲有一些人口中揚言和平，他們的心中，却以戰爭與殺俊爲快呢。就這一些人說來，在他們久戰生厭，痛悟前非時，永恒與眞正的和平仍會光臨全世界的。他們在世事尚未　到不可收拾以前，早日覺醒，自然更好。</p>
<h3>觀察</h3>
<p>— 何云</p>
<p>中國人見了面常喜歡問，「近來做何消遣？」回答多半是：「看看電影，打打牌……」甚而至於「無聊得很」「無事可做」。其實，天下到處都是値得我們硏究的材料，只不過我們不用心罷了。</p>
<p>「觀察」是最有趣的工作。世界上的人形形色色，假使我們能對他們做有修理的分析，則其樂趣無窮。但「觀察」決不是用卑鄙的手段去探聽他人的隱私，觀察的條件是冷靜，觀察他人，分析他人性格，其目的也在於更加了解自己。人類最大的苦痛是不了解自己，這是由於人們常以自我的意識判決自己，而不能以　三者的地位來看自己。觀察他人比較容易客觀。多了解他人也就比較容易多認識自已一些。所以，觀察決非「探聽他人隱私」可比。</p>
<p>我們平常硏究學問或理論，最感不便的，是它們太抽象，或太死板。但是研究人的性格，不但是實際的，而且是活動的工作，最有趣不過了。從一個人的面貌，談吐，舉止…我們可以斷定他的思想，智慧，學識，好惡…我們可以知道，他是好動的還是好靜的，理智的還是富於感情的，堅强的還是懦怯的。雖然這不是一兩天所訓練得出，但久而久之，我們將解開許多微　的性格之謎，而我們的頭腦，亦將變得和幾何學家一樣有條理了。</p>
<h3>三輪哲學</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>自從遷居到虹口，已經八九個月了，每天總是雇一輛三輪車到辦公的地方，習以爲常。今天　然想起，剛搬來時到寫字間的車錢似乎還不到五千元，而現在則已經非三萬元不可了。究竟是什麽時候從五千漲到一萬，什麽時候由一萬漲到兩萬而三萬的呢？簡直說不出來。從前出五千元的時候決不覺得便宜，現在出三萬元了倒也並不覺得太貴。平心而論，車錢的「自動調整」倒是自然而然的，從諷整得完全不着痕跡一點看，就覺得調整得很合理了。</p>
<p>因而想到雇車時的討價還價，其實頗有意思。譬如說，車夫要我四萬元時，他心裏未始沒有存着「三萬元也行了」的心思，所以當我還價時說「二萬五」，他有時就會笑起來說：「好，三萬三萬。」於是交易成功，我和他都很滿意。反之，如果我堅持祗肯二萬元，而正値雨天，地上泥濘難行，他就決不肯答應，而我就祗得在雨中埋頭趕路，皮鞋上濺滿了泥不必說，公事包也濕得像是水裏撈起來一般，焦急之餘，還是要雇車，而結果往往車錢仍是三萬元，徒然多走了一大段路。</p>
<p>故「還價」完全是一個「估計」的問題，他的討價就是對他自己的勞力的估價，而在我呢，就估計這價値是不是合理。我還價，是因為我要「活」（Live）；我不能還價還得太低，因為我也應「讓人家活」（Let　live）。</p>
<p>生物界的競爭是如此的劇烈，「活」與「讓人家活」竟似乎是衝突的了，於是要在這衝突之間找到那一點微妙的平衡，就頗不容易，而「估計」就成爲很困難的一種藝術。日本人如果估計得準確一點，也許就未必會嘗試到原子彈的風味；希特勒如果估計得準確一點，也許今日的地位就仍舊在弗朗哥與貝隆之上。</p>
<p>所以，如果大家善於履三輪軍的話，倒一定是有補於天下之太平的。我的兒子現在尚祗三歲，等到將來他學讀書寫字的時候，我一定先要以雇三輪車之道敎他。我的「庭訓」其實倒也簡單：你不坐三輪車則已，要坐車便還價不能太低，否則儘管你陷足泥淖，唉聲嘆氣，而旁人對你的批評不免仍祗是「活該」二字。</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十三章　力圖補救　（一〇五）</p>
<p>原來這次是綺紈自己一人回來的，因爲和島雲到香港後，住在旅館，起初幾天還帶他參觀兩處攝影工塲，據島雲說，都有他的股本。自參觀這兩處工堪之後，島雲每日出門，總到深夜才回，回來之後，不是爛醉如泥，便是滿身鴉片烟氣味，問他到那裏去，他總是含糊其辭，推託在公司辦事，或和一般朋友應酬，後來見他每天如此，偶然要求和他一同出去，他總是推三阻四，細一打聽，才知道他每日在賭塲裏消遣。香港的賭塲是有名毀人毀爐，那能任他如此，每一規勸他，總說在外面交際，不得不如此，要辦一種大事業，全恃交際，在交際塲中不活動，便失去各種機會，此次來香港，還附帶着幹一種投機買賣，只要這買賣能成功，什麽間題都解決，地所設投機買賣也就是希望在賭塲中能得倖運。看他所作所爲，完全是空虛，所說的電影事業，以及訓練基本人員，聘請明星等事，一語也沒提到，好像在北平在上海所說的話，一到香港，完全都忘了。看他這種情形，那得不急，再四諷刺他，責問他，他只涎着臉說道：「在香港闊人們所應注意，便是投機買賣，只要運氣一到，什麼事都可解決。」有一天夜裏他回來，在屋裏唉心嘆氣，綺紈也不理他，後來他又自言自語，今天真倒霉，她說：「你本來倒霉嗎！一天不幹好事，儘在賭塲裏胡混，那有不倒霉？」他說：「本來不算什麽，轍了一百萬的港幣，也不算什麽，不過這筆款是定貨的款子，我把他輸了，晚了一期再定，就貴得多了！朋友方面，本可以借的，我又不願意開口，上回看見你有一盒首飾，你可否先借我拿出去押一押，明天下午就還你，可以不可以？」綺紈說可以的，不過今天已經三點多鐘了，忙不在一朝，等明天吧！他說：「現在還趕得上。』綺紈也不理他，他也不敢再問了。那晚上綺紈想了一夜，島雲這種舉動，簡直是要騙她東西！再和他混下去，身邊一點積　便要給他騙光了，看這情形，非立刻離開他不可。</p>
<h3>好古與泥古</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>在時間上言，古與今是相對的名詞，已往爲古，現在爲今。這是誰都知道的常識，自然毋庸多　。</p>
<p>據說秦皇焚書坑儒，其動機與當時的士大夭「好古非今」有關。這話也許不是虛構的。因爲秦始皇完成他的天下大一統之後，開始廢封建，設郡縣，在政治方面作空前的大改革。如此一來，滿腦子都見舊文化和復古思想的知識份子，自然　致不滿。於是所謂「入則心非，出則巷議」也者，也未始不是人之常情。於是便超出了一代專制君主所能容忍的範國，以爲他們是存心搗蛋，開口堯舜，閉口文武，「以非當世，惑亂黔首。」結果便演出了「前無古人，後無來者」底焚書坑儒的悲劇，甚至雷厲風行到「偶語詩書者棄市」的地步！</p>
<p>人類也的確有這種劣性，當他不滿於現實之際，就往往大發其「思古之幽情」，自然而然地落入「好古非今」的窠臼。有些更頑固的，便成爲復古者中的死硬派，一味哨死人骨頭，將「祖訓」「古制」之類的廢物搬出來壓倒人。宋代大政治家王安石氏，爲了貫澈新政的決心，他在召對時曾毅然對神宗皇帝說：「天變不足懼，祖宗不足法，人言不足畏。」這是何等有魄力有胆量的話！但「祖宗不足法』這句話就成爲守舊派對他作人身攻擊的焦點，甚至錫以「拗相公」的綽號，從這亦可以知道「古」在守舊者的心中是如何的根深蒂固了</p>
<p>五四之後，胡適等提倡白話文運動，也曾遭遇多少古文的衛道者底圍攻。現在白話文雖已有其堅固不拔的基礎，但是復古的一古交衛道者却仍然大有人在。記得一二年前，猶有人高呼重新提倡白話文的口號，我們不難知道一椿新的改革，必然會遭受到各方面的挑戰，眞是長路迢迢，談何容易！自然，並不是「古」的都完全不好，然而所有不合時代要求而已與時代脫了節的「古』，毫無疑問的是非揚棄不可的。何况，泥古不化，畢竟是阻礙時代進步，而又　其危險的事！</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 21st] The Ministry of Finance previously stated that tungsten sand smuggling was rampant. In addition to ordering the customs to strictly investigate and deal with it, it has also been submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the National Resources Commission to appropriately increase the purchase price on one hand and strictly control it in the production areas on the other hand as a preventive measure. Now that the Hong Kong Financial Agreement has been implemented in January, for goods such as tungsten and antimony transported and exported from Hong Kong, it is generally necessary to verify the foreign exchange settlement certificate signed by the customs tax affairs department when exporting from our country's customs. Tungsten smuggled from Hong Kong cannot be shipped out, so export smuggling can be reduced.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih Calls Himself a Bookworm; Denies Running for Vice President</h3>
<p>Helping the Government Does Not Necessarily Mean Becoming an Official</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] When asked by this newspaper's reporter last night, Hu Shih, the president of Peking University, solemnly denied rumors that he would participate in the government's organization. Hu stated in response to the question of expanding the government's base: The Kuomintang has traditional magnanimity. Government personnel organization has always valued talent, such as Weng Wenhao, Jiang Tingfu, Yu Dawei, Zhou Yichun and others, many of whom are members of the Independent Comment Society and have no party affiliation, but have been successively recruited by the government, just like my predecessor as ambassador to the United States, who also had no party affiliation. He believes that an independent non-partisan person can freely express opinions if they have understanding and insight. "Helping the government does not necessarily mean becoming an official," and after the implementation of the constitution, the government organization must appoint a Premier to form a cabinet after the President and Vice President are elected. It is too early to talk about reorganizing the government at this time. He then humbly stated: "I am a bookworm and cannot even manage my own affairs, let alone politics, which is everyone's business, so I will not interfere." He instructed the reporter to never believe rumors that he would join the government (see page six).</p>

<h3>Election Certificates Take Time to Deliver; National Representatives Continue to Arrive in Beijing; Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, and Others Depart Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 21st] The 21st was the fourth day for national representatives to register. A total of nine people registered throughout the day from 8 AM to 10 PM, bringing the total to seventy-one so far. It is now learned that 388 people are on the way. As of the 21st, the number of national representatives elected nationwide has increased to 2,832. It is said that the reason why so few people have registered in recent days is that it takes time for the election certificates to be delivered, and the representatives must wait for the departure of the ships after receiving the certificates.</p>

<h3>The Central Bank First Allocates Over One Trillion Yuan: Agricultural Loans to Be Released This Month, Allocation Principles Decide to Adopt a Focus-Oriented Approach</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, 21st] After the Four Banks Joint Council determined this year's agricultural loans to be 150,000 times [the original amount], the Sino-Agricultural Bank and the Central Bank negotiated the issue of fundraising. As a result, the Central Bank has already allocated 1,475 billion yuan starting in March, which can be distributed by the Sino-Agricultural Bank to various regions for release within this month. As for the total amount of agricultural loans allocated to each province, the executive meeting of the Sino-Agricultural Bank also discussed and decided on the allocation principles, which adopt a focus-oriented approach and are coordinated with the agricultural department's production increase plan. The amounts allocated to each province vary greatly. According to Li Shuming, the general manager of the Sino-Agricultural Bank, this method is adopted in the hope that agricultural loans will truly benefit production.</p>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, 21st] The Sino-Agricultural Bank's executive meeting continued for four days, discussing the issue of agricultural loans and implementation methods. It concluded on the afternoon of the 21st. The meeting passed over a hundred proposals, most of which were specific implementation methods for agricultural loans, which can be implemented by various branches according to the resolutions. Li Shuming, the general manager of the bank, hosted reporters at 6 p.m. on the 21st to report on the shift in this year's agricultural loan policy. According to Li, this year's agricultural loans are closely coordinated with production, and there are five significant differences in policy compared to previous years: (1) All agricultural loan quotas and implementation methods are based on the government's established plans, especially for grain and cotton, which have been repeatedly discussed with the agricultural department to ensure coordination and focus efforts on the same goal. (2) To ensure effective production increases, a focus-oriented approach is adopted, selecting production centers to avoid dispersion and waste. (3) The entire process of agricultural production, from production, processing, manufacturing, to sales, should have a consistent set of methods to complete the task. This has been planned for a long time, and this year provides an opportunity for implementation, linking everything together to ensure a smooth process, protect farmers' interests, and facilitate the rational circulation of goods. (4) For agriculture to be modernized, it must be managed as an enterprise. Efforts have been made towards this goal for a long time, but the results have not been significant. Starting this year, it is hoped that it can be introduced into the path of enterprise management and establish its initial foundation. (5) The handling of agricultural loans is often subject to criticism, and the bank is happy to accept it and seek improvement. This year presents a good opportunity, so special attention has been paid to simplifying agricultural loan procedures and improving loan effectiveness, ensuring that farmers truly benefit and that production effects are genuinely achieved.</p>
<h3>New York Overseas Chinese Have Good Income, Most Remittances Escape to Hong Kong, Chen Zhonghai Discusses the Situation of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Chen Zhonghai, a representative of overseas Chinese in the eastern United States to the National Assembly, who returned to Beijing from the United States yesterday, spoke to reporters in detail about the situation of overseas Chinese in New York. Chen graduated from Columbia University in the United States with a Ph.D. in philosophy and is currently the chairman of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of New York. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is the highest guiding institution for overseas Chinese in New York. Chen said that the vast majority of overseas Chinese in New York support the government, love their motherland, and their only hope is that the suppression of the rebellion will be completed as soon as possible, and that China will become a strong and democratic country. The overseas Chinese there, with the exception of a few communists, deeply hate the Communist Party. Overseas Chinese are very fond of their motherland and their families, so they remit their savings back to their motherland. Recently, due to the large difference between the black market exchange rate and the official rate, they were unwilling to remit money to their motherland through national banks, so overseas Chinese remittances escaped to Hong Kong. At the same time, some overseas Chinese brought their savings of gold, silver, and assets back to their motherland, but due to the difficulties of customs inspection and even confiscation, returning overseas Chinese often suffered great losses. It is hoped that the government authorities will pay attention to this situation as soon as possible. Regarding the investment of overseas Chinese, Chen said that overseas Chinese are willing to invest all their assets in their motherland, but they hope that the motherland will first have a stable economic society and protection for investment. Chen cited an example, saying that at the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese from all over the United States were enthusiastic about investing in their motherland. Therefore, once various plans were announced, large sums of money were raised immediately. However, later, due to unstable currency values and social instability, overseas Chinese had to take a wait-and-see attitude towards investment. The economic life of overseas Chinese in New York is very good, the number of unemployed overseas Chinese is very small, and the lowest wage for work is 250 US dollars per month, in addition to food and accommodation. For example, restaurant chefs can earn 600 to 700 US dollars per month, in addition to food and accommodation provided by the store owner.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Education Problems, Most Students Attend Foreign Schools</h3>
<p>Most Students Attend Foreign Schools</p>
<p>Domestic Textbooks Are Not Practical</p>
<p>The seriousness of the overseas Chinese education problem in New York is also the same as in other overseas areas. There are about 30,000 to 40,000 overseas Chinese in New York City, of which women account for one-quarter and men account for three-quarters. There are 700 to 800 young children who enter school, but there is only one overseas Chinese elementary school in New York, with about 200 students. The rest of the overseas Chinese children attend local foreign schools. Chen expressed his regret that Chinese textbooks have not been specially edited to meet the needs of overseas Chinese. He said: For example, the civics textbooks in elementary schools teach elementary school students to wash their faces, brush their teeth, and change their clothes every day. Children in foreign countries know how to brush their teeth from a very young age, and what they know is even more detailed than what is in the textbooks. What's more, there is a description of Washington in the textbook. Overseas Chinese children in the United States already know about Washington and his deeds, and because of translation errors, overseas Chinese children feel disgusted when they read it. Textbooks like these cannot arouse the interest of overseas Chinese children. This is also one of the reasons for the failure of overseas Chinese education. The overseas Chinese culture in New York is the most developed in the United States. There are currently five daily newspapers (one of which is run by the Chinese Communist Party) and three weekly publications. Almost every overseas Chinese family reads newspapers.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's New Position, Internally Designated as Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Cavalry</h3>
<p>[Report from Beiping, 21st] Following Zhang Zuoxiang and Wan Fulin's internal designation to take up new positions, it has been learned here that Ma Zhanshan has also been internally designated as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Cavalry. Li Zongren was ordered to solicit the opinions of the three. Ma will go to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 21st to meet with Zhang Zuoxiang before making a concrete decision. It is said that Zhang may accept the new position of Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee because Wei Lihuang is focusing on military affairs in Shenyang and has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to send personnel north to preside over Northeast political affairs. There is still something to be done in the political field. Ma Zhanshan will accept the new appointment, but is extremely concerned about the powers of this organization. Wan Fulin is quite negative about the position of Deputy Director of the Xingyuan. It is said that Zhang and Ma will go to Beijing to ask for instructions after they have decided to accept the appointment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] General Ma Zhanshan arrived in Tianjin by car from Ping on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>
<h3>The United States Purchases Siamese Rice to Ship to China, Work is About to Be Completed, Australia Agrees to Sell Us 20,000 Tons of Wheat</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 21st] According to the US Information Service here, the United States' work of purchasing 30,000 tons of rice in Siam for relief to China is nearing completion. As a relief supply, nearly 20,000 tons of rice have been shipped to China, of which 4,000 tons were shipped to Shanghai and the rest to Guangzhou. The loading of the remaining 10,000 tons that have not yet been shipped is currently underway. All rice shipments are expected to be completed by the end of March. This rice purchase is part of the UNRRA's post-closure plan, which stipulates that the United States will ship food and medicine worth US$27.7 million to China for emergency relief. US Ambassador to Siam, Stanton, said when announcing the procurement agreement in January that this procurement plan is also beneficial to Siam, as Siam can obtain US$5 million in foreign exchange through this. This rice was allocated to China by the United Nations International Emergency Food Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sydney, 21st] The Australian government has agreed to sell 20,000 tons of wheat to China, but the price has not yet been determined. Three types of samples have been sent to China for selection. China originally requested to purchase 40,000 tons of wheat in Australia.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Implement Comprehensive Land Reform!</h3>
<p>The Central China Pacification Conference passed the overall war plan and concluded successfully on the 20th. In addition to correcting the shortcomings of past military and political affairs, this plan stipulates that military, political, and economic matters should be given equal importance and effectively coordinated. Among them, the most noteworthy item is the implementation of the method of granting land to soldiers, stipulating that in principle, each soldier should be granted three to five mu of land, and detailed methods will be formulated separately. At the same time, the Pacification Conference also revised and passed the land disposal measures in the Pacification Zone, deciding in principle that "land in the Pacification Zone that is not self-cultivated, regardless of whether it has been illegally distributed by the Communists or not, will be allowed to retain up to five mu per family member; land exceeding this amount will be requisitioned by the government, and land-in-kind bonds will be issued and repaid within fifteen years, and the land will belong to self-cultivating farmers." However, the specific methods still need to be studied in detail by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Land Affairs, and must complete the legislative process. Land reform in our country is not only an economic issue, but also a political issue. During this period of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, the fundamental solution of this problem is an important factor in determining China's future destiny. The China Land Reform Association recently announced its proposed "China Land Reform Plan" in Beijing to Chinese and foreign reporters for reference and adoption by the national government and the public. It can be seen that the land reform issue is really worthy of our attention at this time.</p>
<p>Our country has always been an agricultural country that "establishes the country through agriculture." Eighty percent of the country's population are farmers who "make a living by farming," and the issue of land distribution has become a key to governance and chaos throughout the dynasties for thousands of years, but it has never been resolved once and for all. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, saw the importance of this issue early on and listed land reform as one of the basic tasks of the revolution. Mr. Sun called out the slogan of "equal land rights" at the same time as "expelling the Tartars" during the Tongmenghui period. Later, in his lectures on the Principle of People's Livelihood, he put forward concrete and practical methods to achieve the highest ideal of "those who till the land have their own land." In the Outline of National Reconstruction, there is also Article 10: "When a county starts self-government, it must first stipulate the price of all privately owned land in the county. For those places where the landlords report the price themselves, the government will tax according to the price and can buy it back at any time according to the price. After this price reporting, if the land increases in value due to political improvement or social progress, then the benefits will be shared by the people of the county, so that the original owner cannot monopolize it." His proposal of "those who till the land have their own land" enriches the content of "equal land rights," and is the best way to solve the land problem, whether in theory or in practice. We assume that after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it showed determination and sincerity and implemented Mr. Sun's method. Then, China's rural economy would not be what it is today, and other economic construction could have laid a solid foundation long ago. However, for the past twenty years, on the one hand, due to the constant cycle of foreign troubles and internal strife, the government has not made this fundamental plan. On the other hand, because the government has always hesitated and has not made up its mind, the policies and laws promulgated regarding land have not fundamentally solved this serious problem, so that the problem has been used by the Communists as a weapon for political struggle. The government must deeply reflect on this mistake.</p>
<p>Looking at the policies and actions taken by the Communists on the land issue, it is clear that they have also moved from "land revolution" to "land reform." When the Kuomintang implemented the party purge in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party originally advocated "land revolution," confiscating the land of landlords by violence and distributing it to farmers. Later, in the 17th year, the Communist Party announced the "Land Program," and in the 19th year, it promulgated the "Land Law" twice, and in the 20th year, it promulgated the "Land Law" for the third time. Although the content has changed, they are all a continuation of the "land revolution." It was not until the outbreak of the full-scale Anti-Japanese War on July 7th that the Communist Party issued a declaration of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on September 23rd, and solemnly declared: "Stop the policy of confiscating the land of landlords by violence." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party once again made trouble and attempted to expand its territory by force, so it restored the method of land revolution in Hebei, Shandong, and Northern Jiangsu. However, the implementation of this "land revolution" of liquidating landlords not only failed to alleviate the pain of poverty, but also deepened the bankruptcy of the countryside. At the same time, in order to deceive foreigners and make them mistakenly believe that the Communist Party is a political party that carries out land reform, it promulgated the "Land Law Outline" on October 10th last year, changing its face and falsely claiming to implement a land system of "those who till the land have their own land." Although the land private ownership system of landlords was abolished, the land private ownership system of farmers was recognized. This transformation of the Communist Party directly illustrates that the "land revolution" is not suitable for China's national conditions, and it will not work no matter what. Indirectly, it also proves that the land reform proposal advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen is the only way to solve the land problem in China. However, the land reform currently implemented by the Communist Party is not actually "those who till the land have their own land." They distribute the remaining amount of land restricted by the old landlords to each household, regardless of whether he cultivates it himself, and they also allow the land to be transferred after it is distributed. Therefore, the old landlords are liquidated and overthrown, and new landlords are naturally produced soon. This is really a way of hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat. However, we should know that the Three Principles of the People are the highest principles of all administrative policies of the National Government and the highest ideals that the National Revolution wants to achieve. The failure to truly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood is a shame for the Kuomintang! Now that the Communist Party is using Mr. Sun's land policy as a weapon for political struggle, how can the National Government not catch up quickly? The decision of this Central China Pacification Conference to revise the land disposal measures in the Pacification Zone is undoubtedly a progressive and wise measure.</p>
<p>At present, the areas harassed by the Communists are expanding with the development of their rebellion, and the Communists are flaunting their so-called "land reform" there. Therefore, the land struggle and the military struggle have become the two major weapons of the Communist rebellion. Therefore, the government must quickly and drastically deal with the land problem, earnestly implement Mr. Sun's teachings, implement land reform, and achieve the degree of truly "those who till the land have their own land," and then the suppression of the rebellion on the military can be optimistic. Therefore, we would also like to put forward some opinions on the land reform issue for the authorities to consider.</p>
<p>First, it cannot be said that the government's failure to effectively solve the land problem in our country in the past twenty years is a major failure of the Kuomintang's administration. The reason for this may be that the composition of the Kuomintang is relatively complicated, or there are large landlords with feudal forces lurking among them, obstructing the land reform. However, the Kuomintang should be a revolutionary party that implements equal land rights in its essence. The decadent forces that obstruct land reform must be eliminated. Now that the government authorities know the importance of land reform and have decided to implement it, they should adopt the attitude of "the past cannot be admonished, but the future can be pursued," catch up quickly, and quickly seek the realization of Mr. Sun's proposal for land reform. Judging from the resolutions of the Central China Pacification Conference, land reform is still limited to the Pacification Zone. However, we believe that this method of partial solutions, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, will still not solve the whole problem. The only way to do it now is to follow Mr. Sun's teachings and earnestly handle it in all parts of the country. The China Land Reform Association's proposed China Land Reform Plan can be used as a basis for national officials and the public to study and discuss. In particular, intellectuals should awaken and unite and urge the government to have a land reform method that is universally applicable throughout the country in the shortest possible time, regardless of whether it is in the north or south, or in the Pacification Zone or non-Pacification Zone, and must be earnestly handled to achieve the goals stipulated in the Principle of People's Livelihood for equal land rights. In this way, it will not only be conducive to the suppression of the rebellion, but also lay a solid foundation for national economic construction.</p>
<p>Second, the most thorough way to solve the land problem is to have those who till the land have their own land. But there are various ways to solve it, which are worth our study. The Communists first confiscated the land of the landlords by violence and distributed it to the farmers, but now they have changed to "distributing land equally according to population." That is just a way of "dividing land equally," and it is not a true "those who till the land have their own land." The malpractices involved are naturally numerous, and the most obvious is that it is just overthrowing the old landlords and supporting the new landlords - the landlords under the wings of the Communist Party, which is of no benefit to the poor farmers who cultivate the land themselves. What kind of method should the National Government adopt in the future to be the most thorough? The China Land Reform Association suggests that the tenant farming system should be terminated and tenants should be turned into self-cultivating farmers to achieve the goal of those who till the land have their own land. Of course, this is much better than what is forced in the Communist-controlled areas, and whether it can be adopted is really worth studying.</p>
<p>Third, today's rural areas, after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and two and a half years of the bandit rebellion, have long reached the brink of bankruptcy. Relying solely on the reform of "those who till the land have their own land" may still not be enough to save the poverty of the rural areas. To be honest, if the government does not find ways to take other measures to relieve the rural areas, the general poor farmers who have "no way to borrow" will not only be unable to cultivate the land they are allowed to cultivate, but will simply be unable to live. Therefore, at this time when the national government and the public are paying attention to the land reform issue, we have to appeal for the poor rural areas across the country and ask the government to make a comprehensive consideration of the policy of conscription and grain collection. At the same time, in the technology of issuing agricultural loans, it must be done in a way that loans are given to real farmers, and that they can be saved from escaping the fire and water as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fourth, before land reform, it is futile to talk about improving the soil, eliminating pests, improving seeds, and mechanizing agricultural tools, as it will not solve the actual problems. However, when implementing land reform, if the technology and methods of agricultural production are not reformed at the same time, and the Chinese countryside is forever stuck in the ancient model, it will not be able to save the collapse of the rural economy.</p>
<p>In short, today, for the sake of the future of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, it is really urgent to implement comprehensive land reform. This resolution of the Central China Pacification Conference can be said to have scratched the itch. However, we also hope that the government must not only do passive work, thinking that land reform only needs to be done in the Pacification Zone, but must thoroughly implement comprehensive land reform.</p>

In the evening, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, and others gathered at the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang to discuss solutions. During Chen's talks with the representatives, Chen stated: (1) The elected representatives who received the majority of votes in the election should be issued certificates of election or certificates of election by the election authorities first, and should be issued completely by the 23rd. (2) This does not apply to those who voluntarily give up and are not forced, and who have gone through legal procedures. It is also learned that in Chen's talks with the representatives, he said: The elected issue within the party is now very simple. Except for those who have voluntarily given up and those who have agreements, the rest of the Standing Committee has a resolution to issue certificates of election in accordance with the election results. The only problem is the hundreds of people related to friendly parties.</p>

<h3>Developing Yinggehai Salt Fields</h3>
<p>Wu Zhixian Completes Inspection in Hainan</p>
<p>[Report from Haikou, 20th] Wu Zhiwei, the special commissioner of the Liangguang Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance for developing the Yinggehai Salt Fields, returned to Guangzhou on the 19th after inspecting the Yinggehai Salt Fields in Hainan. According to Wu, before boarding the plane, he told reporters: The annual output of Yinggehai salt could originally reach about 7.5 million dan to 10 million dan. Since the capture of the Japanese enemy and the wind and water disaster in the previous year, the vitality has been greatly lost. Currently, the initial salt production can only reach 4 million dan to 7 million dan per year. He is already raising funds in Guangzhou to purchase machinery and materials and will set up his own generator to supply the entire field. If the funds can be resolved, the annual production capacity there will be sufficient to meet the needs of the whole country.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st] The central government has recently allocated 200 million yuan to Fujian as relief funds for overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies who are stranded in Fujian awaiting repatriation. The Far East Bureau of the International Refugee Organization for Repatriated Overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies in Xiamen conducted repatriation registration last month and originally planned to send them out of the country at the beginning of this month. However, because the Dutch East Indies authorities requested that the documents of those leaving the country be sent for inspection, there has been no reply to date, and the registered repatriated overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies have still not left the country. Furthermore, according to news from Batavia received here: Order in the Dutch East Indies has gradually been restored, and transportation in various places has been reopened one after another. The Chinese security teams in Medan and other places have begun to disband. However, the Dutch East Indies government implemented an import restriction order on the 15th of this month, which has greatly impacted the import business of overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ship Sailing to Taiwan to Load Sugar Carries a Large Number of Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Seized and Confiscated by Customs</p>

<h3>Operations of China National Aviation Corporation and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Japan Are Stalled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The offices of the Bank of China, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and China National Aviation Corporation, which were permitted by the Allied General Headquarters to be established in Japan, are likely to remain symbolic institutions for a considerable period of time, with limited business and insufficient income to cover expenses. The failure to determine exchange rates between the Japanese yen and foreign currencies, various restrictions imposed by the Allied General Headquarters, and the scarcity of trade between China and Japan have all made it impossible for commercial institutions to develop their business. These three are currently engaged in starting work, and the first problem they encounter is housing. The personnel of the three institutions are currently staying in hotels that accommodate foreign merchants, incurring significant daily expenses. However, even if they obtain office space, they will not be able to do much work under the current circumstances. According to sources at the Bank of China, the Allied General Headquarters only permits "legal entities" (most overseas Chinese are not included) to deposit funds, and the deposits are denominated in Japanese yen.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Merchant's Wife Gives Birth to a Deformed Fetus: A Two-Headed Baby Girl</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] This morning, the Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital received a two-headed baby girl during a delivery. The infant's limbs are no different from those of ordinary people. The two heads grow separately between the left and right shoulders, forming a symmetrical shape.

<h3>"Limiting Land Rent on Agricultural Land"</h3>
<p>Measures Awaiting Approval and Implementation by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the implementation of rent reduction, the National Government issued an order to all provinces and cities at the time of victory to implement the "25% Rent Reduction," which stipulates that in areas where land taxes have been exempted after the victory, rent should be reduced by one-fourth at the same time. However, this "25% Rent Reduction" is limited to the year of tax exemption and is temporary in nature. As for subsequent farmland rental rates, in places where the land price has been legally stipulated, the land rent shall not exceed 8% of the land price. In places where the land price has not been legally stipulated, the land rent to be paid by tenant farmers should still be calculated temporarily according to the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 10050, which is 3.75 per thousand of the main product. Guangxi Province has formulated implementation measures for farmland rental in the province, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. According to Article 2 of the measures, "Land rent on farmland should be strictly limited in accordance with the provisions of Article 110 of the Land Law." In Hunan Province's "25% Rent Reduction," the Provincial Land Administration Bureau has, in accordance with the rent reduction principle, promulgated the "Implementation Measures for Tax Exemption and Rent Reduction in Hunan Province," ordering all cities and counties to strictly implement them. The work of tax exemption and rent reduction is still being completed in the 36th year, and the method is to reduce the original rent by one-fourth, which does not refer to the provision of "3.75 per thousand of the main product." Other provinces, such as Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Suiyuan, have also promulgated and implemented similar separate measures. In order to remedy the malpractices of implementing statutory land rent, the Ministry of Land Affairs previously formulated "Measures to Limit Land Rent on Agricultural Land" based on the economic reform plan, stipulating that farmland lease contracts must be reviewed and registered for control, so as to avoid the occurrence of the above-mentioned malpractices. The measures have been approved by the National Economic Commission and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3>Self-Defense and Protecting the Nation</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhi</p>
<p>Suppressing bandits and pacifying the country is our established national policy. In order to maintain the highest interests of the nation and the people, to protect their basic survival and the rights of democracy and freedom, and to save the suffering people in the bandit areas, the entire country has mobilized all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to fight the communists. To complete the task of suppressing bandits and pacifying the country, we must first recognize what "bandits" are. Simply put, although "bandits" are also Chinese people with yellow faces, they have lost their humanity, destroyed their conscience, are willing to sell out their motherland, harm their own brothers, destroy the lives of others, and rob others of their food and clothing to vent their bestiality. The degree of their viciousness and cruelty surpasses any historical bandit, traitor, or puppet. The military task of suppressing bandits today is to eliminate the communists who are overturning the foundations of the country and taking the lives of the people. Only in this way can the country have independence and freedom, and society can regain the hope of safety. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>During the suppression of bandits and pacification of the country, it is necessary for the national army generals to fight valiantly and selflessly on the front lines, but it is also necessary to have sound local forces to protect the local areas because local forces are familiar with the terrain and have convenience for combat. For example, when the communists recently roamed the Nanyang, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Zhenping areas in southwestern Henan, they were bravely blocked and attacked by local militias, achieving brilliant results. The central government specially issued an order to commend them and allocated funds for rewards. This shows that the establishment of self-defense forces during the period of bandit suppression is truly urgent.</p>
<p>Shanghai's conscription work for this year is about to begin, and 6,000 new recruits will be enlisted. These new recruits were originally intended to be sent to the front lines, but the military service conference has passed a resolution recommending to the central government that they be trained locally to strengthen security. Because the city is an international metropolis, the center of the country's economy, industry, and commerce, its safety is crucial to the foundations of the country, and its position is extremely important. The communists harbor malicious intentions and are constantly looking for opportunities, such as the labor strikes and student unrest that have occurred in the past, as well as the roaming of Ding Xishan's bandit troops, which are all manifestations of communist conspiracies. After these 6,000 new recruits are conscripted, it has been decided that they will stay in Shanghai, be trained locally, and become a strong force to stabilize Greater Shanghai. In other words, they are to protect their hometown and guarantee their lives and property. We have seen refugees from the communist areas fleeing to Shanghai, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, living a wandering and homeless life. We have seen newspaper and magazine articles accumulating records of the communists' crimes of harming the country and the people. We have heard how many places have been devastated by the communists' burning, killing, looting, and how countless compatriots have been destroyed by the communists' struggles and liquidations. From these facts that we have heard and seen, we can know that the communists are a flood and a beast, and they are the people's moths who do all kinds of evil. If we do not contribute our abilities and defend ourselves in time, once the communists roam around, I am afraid that people with property, land, and knowledge will be at a loss and have nowhere to turn. I hope that everyone thoroughly recognizes the seriousness of the communist bandits, recognizes that protecting the country requires protecting the home first, and protecting the home requires social stability. All men of age, regardless of poverty or wealth, regardless of class, should enthusiastically enlist in the army. This is the only way to defend ourselves and protect the country. In short, to prosper Greater Shanghai and stabilize Greater Shanghai, we must first start by training local forces and protecting Greater Shanghai. Otherwise, "if the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to!" This is something that every citizen should be wary of.</p>

<h3>Former Italian Territory Placed Under Italian Trusteeship; Agreement Reached on Three-Power Principle; Italians Overjoyed at Return of Trieste</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] Top-level sources in the United States revealed today that the Western powers will issue a declaration within two weeks endorsing the recommendation to return the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy and support the placement of some of Italy's former African colonies under Italian trusteeship. An American representative on the Trusteeship Council stated that the Western powers have reached an agreement in principle to place Italian Somaliland and Eritrea under Italian trusteeship. Britain opposes placing Libya under Italian trusteeship because it has promised the local natives that they will never again be subjected to Italian control.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 20th] The Italian people tonight welcomed the proposal to return Trieste to Italy. Political gatherings were interrupted by the news. Crowds gathered in front of radio stations, and people rushed to newspaper offices to buy extra editions. Cries of "Long live Trieste!" echoed through the streets of the ancient city, and the flag of the Republic fluttered from public and private buildings. Prime Minister Gasperi said, "This news makes me very happy. I am sure that justice is being served." A communist leader lamented, "We have to start all over again."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Milan Radio reported that Italian flags were hanging from the balconies of every building in Trieste, and crowds were singing Italian patriotic songs in the streets to celebrate the decision of the three powers, Britain, the United States, and France, to return the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy. [United Press, Washington, 20th] The United States today took the surprising step of jointly proposing with Britain and France to return the Trieste area to Italy. Diplomatic authorities believe that this is a swift action to help the anti-communist faction in Italy win in the upcoming elections. Trieste is an area coveted by Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union is in a difficult position. If it supports the proposal of the United States, Britain, and France, it will displease Yugoslavia. If the Soviet Union opposes the return of Trieste, it will deal a blow to the Italian Communist Party and prevent it from winning popular support. The occupation of Trieste is Italy's biggest political problem, and the Italian Communist Party is hoping for Soviet action. If the Soviet Union and the Western countries cannot compromise, Trieste will be an indefinitely divided area between the British-American occupation zone and the Yugoslav army occupation zone, which could lead to danger. The Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Kosa Novic, was deeply shocked by the proposal of Britain, the United States, and France, and said, "I don't know if this move is intended to provoke Yugoslavia to take a step that would give other countries an excuse to directly participate in the situation. I don't know why the US government is unwilling to contribute to the UN organization in everything."</p>
<h3>France and Italy Sign Customs Union; Bidault Meets with Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 21st Broadcasting: Turin News, French Foreign Minister Bidault declared at a press conference today that he was deeply pleased with the repercussions caused by the Western countries' suggestion to return the Trieste area to Italy within Italian territory. When asked whether this announcement was intended to influence the Italian elections on April 18, Mr. Pi extended his hands and smiled, saying: "Nothing to report." Yesterday, Mr. Pierre met with Italian Prime Minister Gasperi and he will discuss the recommendations of Britain, the United States, and France regarding Trieste. Today, Italian Foreign Minister Sfors attended the meeting with Mr. Pierre. He expressed his deep happiness with the new developments regarding the Trieste problem, and believed that this action could strike a blow at the Communist Party's position in the elections. It is reported that this recommendation was already prepared three weeks ago, but the United States hopes that Mr. Pierre can announce it in the area with the strongest communist forces in Italy when he visits Italy. On the Yugoslav side, the Communist Party newspaper claimed that this was a means played by the imperialists before the Italian elections.</p>
<p>[Reuters Turin, 20th] French Foreign Minister Pierre and Italian Foreign Minister Sfors today signed the French-Italian Customs Union Protocol, the French-Italian Commercial Agreement, and the Payment Agreement at the Madama Palace. At the signing ceremony, Mr. Pi declared that Britain, the United States, and France had suggested to the Soviet Union and Italy to return the Free Zone of Trieste to Italy. Italian Foreign Minister Sffsa expressed that the agreement signed today is unprecedented in modern history and will affect the ideas, interests, and property of 100 million people in France and Italy. These two great nations will show the world that while still maintaining their different traditional qualities, they can still engage in the most systematic and fruitful unity. The two great lights of Western civilization will increasingly increase their power.</p>
<h3>British and American Troops on Alert to Prevent Incidents in Trieste</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] Well-informed sources say that Yugoslavia's reaction to the Western allies' return of Trieste could create a "tense or dangerous" situation in the area. They said that if a backlash occurs, the 10,000 British and American troops in the area will be ordered to stand guard. A spokesman said that a demonstration "is often possible" in Yugoslavia around Trieste, but that steps have been taken to prevent clashes between Italians and Slavs. It is reported that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, had considered the Slav response and its consequences at the Paris conference last week.</p>
<h3>Western European Five Nations to Discuss Establishing a Consultative Committee</h3>
<p>Nordic Three Nations Deny Discussing Joint Defense</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 20th] Representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the five nations of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will hold a special meeting here next Wednesday to discuss the five-nation consultative committee stipulated in the Western European Union treaty. Recommendations will be made to the governments of the five nations on the following three points: (1) where should the headquarters of the consultative committee be located, and where should meetings be held; (2) when should meetings be held; (3) the organization of the secretariat and the question of appointing a secretary-general. The representatives of the five nations will be the British, French, and Dutch Ambassadors to Belgium, the Luxembourg Minister to Belgium, and a senior official from the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 20th] Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft today denied rumors that the meeting of the three Scandinavian Prime Ministers held in Stockholm had discussed the issue of a defense alliance.</p>
<h3>East-West Split Entering a New Stage; Communist Influence Spreading</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Observers here say that the arrival of the Finnish delegation in Moscow and the actions Moscow takes in the coming days will usher the development of the East-West confrontation into a new phase. The division of Europe is now nearly complete, with, on one side, the countries participating in the Marshall Aid Plan, and on the other, the countries echoing the Soviet Union's opposition to the Marshall Plan. The growth of Communist influence has made rapid progress in recent years. Before the war, there were only 160,000 Communist Party members in the Eastern European countries of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania, but today that number has reached six million. The governments of the seven Eastern European countries controlled by the Communist Party govern 90 million people. In the Far East, the Chinese Communist Party had only 700,000 members before the war, but today that number has reached two million, and the North Korean Communist Party claims to have ten million members. At the end of 1947, the Communist Party also established the Communist Information Bureau, with its headquarters in Belgrade. Recently, it has been reported that Communist Information Bureaus have also been established in Harbin and Sydney. The establishment of this institution coincides with the gradual concretization of the Marshall Plan. It is expected that the conflict between Eastern and Western forces will become more acute.</p>
<h3>German Elected Government May Be Established This Winter</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] People here expect that a German government based on free elections may be established this winter. If the Soviet Union agrees, this government will be the government of the entire Germany; otherwise, it will be the German government of West Germany. It is believed here that the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France have tentatively agreed on the principle of restoring the German government when they meet in London to discuss the German question, but at the same time, they will formulate occupation measures to regulate the rights and obligations of Germans and occupying countries. People here hope that when the three powers resume consultations in April, they can finalize this interim agreement and decide on a timetable for holding direct German elections. British and American officials here believe that, according to international law and the laws of occupation, the rapid establishment of a democratically elected German government and its participation in the European Recovery Program is the best response to the Communist offensive against Germany. It is also believed here that it is no longer necessary to be afraid of the Communist propaganda of "opposing the division of Germany" if the Western countries adopt affirmative policies. The Soviet Union's active propaganda of the "German People's Congress for Unity and a Reasonable Peace" has completely failed in West Germany.</p>

<h3>Allied Control Council for Germany Holds Meeting; Soviet Representative Withdraws Midway, Virtually Announcing the End of Joint Control; This Action Appears to Be Premeditated</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] The Soviet delegation, led by Marshal Sokolovsky, withdrew from today's meeting of the Four-Power Allied Control Council after Sokolovsky stated, "I feel it is meaningless to continue this meeting." Before withdrawing, Sokolovsky also said, "The actions of the Western countries prove that they have violated the agreement on the control of Germany, and therefore confirm that the Allied Control Council is no longer an institution for the four countries to implement control." After Sokolovsky withdrew, General Clay, the U.S. military commander, took the chair, and the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France continued the meeting. They decided that the date of the next meeting of the Allied Control Council would be determined later. A British spokesperson later said that there was no reason to believe that the next meeting would not be held. At the beginning of today's meeting of the Allied Control Council, the Soviet representative suggested discussing the resolutions passed by the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia and Poland at a meeting in Prague on February 18. British military commander Robertson, with the endorsement of France and the United States, stated that since the Prague resolutions were put forward at the government level, they should not be discussed in the Allied Control Council. Sokolovsky then stated that since the Western Allies were unwilling to discuss the important matters raised by Germany's three neighboring countries, it was clear that the Western Allies no longer regarded the Allied Control Council as an institution for controlling occupied Germany. He also accused the Western countries of using the Allied Control Council as a smokescreen to cover up their actions. Sokolovsky stated that since the Western countries refused to discuss the "Prague resolutions," he would withdraw them. He then attacked the London talks on the German question held by Britain, the United States, and France, accusing the three powers of neither notifying the Allied Control Council in advance nor keeping the details of the meeting secret afterward. Robertson then replied that the London meeting was a temporary consultation that only made recommendations to their respective governments and did not form a resolution. After the governments formed a resolution, they would naturally notify the Allied Control Council. General Clay and French military commander Koenig both expressed their agreement with Robertson's opinion. Thereupon, Sokolovsky read a pre-prepared long statement, stating that "The Allied Control Council is no longer an institution for the four countries to implement control." After reading it, he stormed out of the meeting, and the entire Soviet delegation followed him. Sokolovsky's leading the entire Soviet delegation out of the Allied Control Council indicates that the Soviet government believes that the joint control of Germany by the four powers has ended, and Germany has definitively split into two. Sokolovsky's reading of a pre-prepared statement further shows that the Soviet action was premeditated rather than taken on the spur of the moment. According to a dispatch from Paris, responsible observers believe that Sokolovsky's action is a serious gesture. His statement that "The Allied Control Council is no longer a four-power control agency" may be announcing the end of the Berlin Allied Control Council. This action by the Soviet Union may reflect its unease after the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France intensified their solidarity in West Germany. When U.S. military commander Clay was asked afterward whether Sokolovsky's action indicated the end of the four-power control government over Germany, Clay said that it was not necessarily so and that it would depend on future developments to decide. According to a senior American diplomat participating in the Allied Control Council, the withdrawal of the Soviet delegation from the meeting was clearly a pre-planned move.</p>
<h3>Britain Seeks to Avert the Crisis; Some Suggest a Summit Meeting Between British and Soviet Leaders; Shinwell Hopes the Soviet Union Can Be Frank and Make a Statement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] British Labour MP Cocks will submit a motion to the House of Commons, asking Prime Minister Attlee, South African President Smuts, and Indian Governor-General Mountbatten to form a delegation to visit Marshal Stalin to seek a status quo agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union and between Eastern and Western Europe based on mutual non-interference in each other's spheres of influence. At the same time, Secretary of State for War Shinwell said in a speech in Windsor today that he welcomed Soviet leaders to make a frank statement so that people could "take a breath of fresh air." He also said that a war with the Soviet Union was unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Finnish Delegation Departs for Moscow</h3>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 21st] The Finnish delegation left here this morning for Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union. When the delegation's special train left the station, a group of non-Communists sang the national anthem, while a group of Communists gathered on the other side of the station, responding with "The Internationale." The situation was tense for a moment, but the Communists eventually changed and sang the national anthem with the non-Communists, and the tension eased. The delegation is led by Foreign Minister Enckell and includes seven main representatives and many political, military, and technical advisors. Soviet Minister to Finland Lieutenant General Savonenkov is accompanying them.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Calls for Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 21st] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt recently made a speech to the Australian Committee of the United Nations, stating, "We must stop the trend towards war at all costs." He said that no responsible person in the world wants war. The United Nations organization is the hope for world peace and raising living standards. The greatest contribution that people of goodwill can make to the world is to fully support the United Nations. Accepting the pessimistic predictions of a third world war is defeatism.</p>
<h3>After the US Abandons the Partition Plan for the Holy Land, Jews Will Establish a Jewish State; Marshall Admits that Abandoning Partition Was His Idea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 20th] Well-informed sources said tonight that after the United States abandoned the partition plan for Palestine, Jewish leaders would almost immediately announce the establishment of a Hebrew state in Palestine. Jewish combat forces have made it clear that they will use force to defend the borders of this state. The Arabs are hesitant about whether to continue fighting. However, there are still scattered Arab-Jewish conflicts in various parts of Palestine. Arab army commander Ghulqi told a reporter, "We entered Pakistan not to attack partition, but to attack Zionism. Whether the United States supports partition or not is irrelevant."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, Palestine, 20th] Jewish Public Council member Greenbaum said tonight that the Jewish state already exists and will be defended by the Jewish army. Only Jews can determine the fate of their homeland. The Jews will never accept temporary or permanent foreign trusteeship.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall admitted on the evening of the 20th that the decision of the United States to abandon the partition plan for Palestine was conceived by him personally.</p>
<p>US Change of Position will Test the UN</p>
<p>[United Press, dispatch] American officials and other United Nations diplomats here point out that the United States is seriously considering how to make its new proposal for Palestine avoid Soviet opposition and its veto power. The US side confirms that no matter how strongly the Soviet Union opposes this new plan, it will be passed, and emphasizes that the basic principles of the new plan will not be defeated by the veto power. The US's new plan for Palestine will first be submitted to the Security Council. If the Soviet Union uses its veto power, the US can bypass the Security Council to achieve its goals. If the Soviet Union vetoes the Security Council's convening of the United Nations General Assembly, the US is prepared to suggest that a special session be convened by a majority of the fifty-seven nations. However, convening the General Assembly through the Security Council can save time, and the time factor is very important at present, as Britain's trusteeship will end on May 15. Although British officials have repeatedly stated that the trusteeship will end on May 15, there is still hope here that British troops can postpone their withdrawal to wait for the US trusteeship plan to be passed and implemented. United Nations officials deeply fear that canceling the partition plan will further reduce the UN's credibility. Some quarters believe that the Palestinian question and the Czech crisis may turn the United Nations into a group of Western countries directly opposing the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] There are two motives behind the US government's proposal to abandon the Pakistan partition plan: (1) to avoid the simultaneous deployment of US and Soviet troops to Palestine for guard duty; (2) to protect US oil rights in Arab countries.</p>
<p>The British Side Originally Wished to Change; Determination to Withdraw Troops from the Holy Land</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London dispatch] Officials announced that Britain will terminate its mandate over the Holy Land on May 15, regardless of the US decision to abandon the partition plan, and will withdraw all British troops by August 1. The British Colonial Office said that the current new situation does not affect the British government's determination to terminate its mandate on schedule.</p>
<h3>Pro-Soviet Czech Foreign Minister Explains Czech Diplomatic Creed; Treat Honesty with Honesty and Exchange Friendship for Friendship</h3>
<p>[Reuters, dispatch] Czech Foreign Minister Clementis delivered his first broadcast speech since taking office, pointing out that some parties deliberately launched war propaganda, like that of the hysterics, to cover up other more dangerous events, such as using Germany as an economic alliance and political springboard against its former victims. Clementis said that the Security Council's acceptance of Chile's complaint that the Soviet Union pressured the Czech government to accept Communist demands was shameful. Finally, he said that Czech foreign policy would not change and would remain "loyalty for loyalty, friendship for friendship."</p>
<h3>Bridges Asks for Explanation of US Military Preparation Plan</h3>
<p>Military and Political Leaders to Report to the Senate Today</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today demanded that the government inform Congress under what circumstances the United States intends to go to war to deter the Soviet Union. He said that this question "must" be answered before Congress votes on President Truman's proposed universal military training bill and the European Recovery Program funding. Bridges said that Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal will be invited to provide information on this matter when they appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Japan May Receive US Aid Next Year; US$765 Million; US Investigation Team in Japan to Review the Japanese Economy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The results of a United Press investigation of planned legislation are as follows: If current congressional and official plans come to fruition, Japan could receive US$765 million in loans from the United States in the next fiscal year. Authorities say this number may increase again when the Army and State Department complete their plans to restore Japanese industry to pre-war levels. The US's intensified aid to Japan is expected to provoke opposition from some Far Eastern countries, especially China, as China is only receiving US$570 million in economic aid and very limited military aid.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Under Secretary of the Army Draper and the US industrial delegation he led arrived here today. Draper told reporters that the delegation would review Japan's economic progress and discuss with MacArthur plans to revive the Japanese economy and make it self-sufficient.</p>
<h3>Ashida's Policy Address; Japanese Parties Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Ashida's policy address to the Diet on the 20th is generally regarded by the Japanese people as being for external propaganda and is not taken seriously. The reactions of the various political parties are recorded as follows: (1) Democratic Liberal Party: "There was no explanation of the countermeasures against inflation, taxes, and prices, which are of greatest concern to the current Japanese people. Everything is entrusted to dependence on foreign countries, and no measures for Japan's self-reliance were pointed out. It is self-deception to say that self-reliance can obtain foreign aid. Chief Secretary Kurisu's speech merely repeats the policies of the previous Katayama cabinet and has no new content"; (2) Socialist Party: "Prime Minister Ashida's speech was mostly from an international standpoint, and there was no clear indication of domestic policies, which is a pity. As for Chief Secretary Kurisu, he merely listed items without knowing what the outcome will be"; (3) Socialist Reform Party: "Ashida's speech was empty and meaningless, and it was an expression of the cabinet's irresponsibility."</p>

<h3>Conscription Lottery to Be Held Tomorrow; To Increase Citizens' Awareness of Military Service; Military Service Association to Hold Propaganda Rally at the Queen's Theatre Today</h3>
<p>The conscription process for new recruits in this city, apart from background checks and applications for deferments, which are handled according to the information obtained last year, and the arrangement and numbering of eligible men, has been rushed to completion by the Military Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau. The "1948 Conscription Indirect Lottery Ceremony" will be held at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow in the auditorium of the City Council. Mayor Wu will preside over the event. The city headquarters of the Kuomintang, the China Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, the City Council, the Garrison District, the Regiment District, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the High Prosecutor's Office, the District Prosecutor's Office, the District Court, the Lawyers' Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the City Farmers' Association, and local associations have also been invited to send representatives to supervise the event. More than eighty members of the lottery committee of the Military Service Association, which is in an advisory position, will attend the event in full. It is understood that the lottery method is not limited to drawing only the number of recruits assigned from all eligible men. Every eligible man who is included in the roster of eligible men will draw a lot, but this does not mean that they have been "selected." It only determines the order of conscription. For example, if there are still vacancies after registering volunteers, the lottery numbers at the top of the list will be checked against the sealed numbering roster, and they will be conscripted. If there are not enough, they will be filled in order. This numbered roster will be sealed until it is needed for conscription. Therefore, the results of the lottery can only reveal which number will be conscripted first and which number will be conscripted last. It is not possible to know in advance which number belongs to which person. Moreover, the numbers on the roster are placed in no particular order, so this method is absolutely fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>In addition, the Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai Military Service Association, in order to make citizens deeply aware of the meaning of military service, will hold a military service propaganda rally at the Queen's Theatre on Xizang Middle Road at 9:00 a.m. today.

After the meeting, there will also be wonderful entertainment programs, such as the opera "Sending My Husband to War" by Li Jingjie and others, the drama "Joining the Army" by the Pacification Drama Troupe, "Military Music" by Xiao Kuaile, and Mo Feixian's magic show. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate freely, and no admission tickets are required.</p>

<h3>Silk Factory Layoff Dispute: Bureau of Social Affairs to Mediate Today</h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival this year, the industrial sector has gradually shown signs of depression. The Huacheng Silk Factory at 1140 Kangding Road in West Shanghai has not reopened since the Spring Festival. Citing the unstable environment in the city, the factory plans to relocate its business to Hong Kong. On the 19th of last month, it posted a notice laying off 50 workers. The remaining 40 workers were told that if they wished to go to Hong Kong, they could go, otherwise, they would also be laid off. However, the labor side did not agree because the factory did not pay severance, leading to a stalemate until the 17th of this month, when the factory stopped providing meals, and the situation became serious. The workers elected representatives to go to the Silk Thread Industry Union in the Third District to seek support. The Union then accompanied them to the Bureau of Social Affairs to petition, requesting three points: (1) resume work as usual, (2) continue to provide meals as usual, and (3) pay severance to laid-off workers. The Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled a meeting this afternoon to convene labor and management for mediation.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Greatly Reduced After the Sino-British Agreement Signed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling authorities: In recent months, smuggling has greatly improved. Since the signing of the Sino-British Agreement, large-scale smuggling of entire ships has not been discovered. However, it is difficult to eradicate sporadic smuggling of small amounts of contraband. Currently, the Customs Anti-Smuggling authorities have dispatched additional anti-smuggling personnel to conduct strict searches of crew cabins and passenger luggage. They have also contacted the shipping companies to automatically punish crew members or sailors found smuggling or assisting in smuggling. It is said that current smuggled goods are mostly silk stockings, foreign wine, and Western medicine. Most of these goods are prohibited from import. Therefore, smuggling not only evades tariffs but also evades control, undermining the national economic policy and causing significant harm. The Customs authorities urgently hope that the people will report and assist the government.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Zou JinKui, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau's cooperative undertaking plan for this year: The key points of this year's work are based on the development of last year's work plan in terms of quantity, and consumer cooperatives in factories, agricultural production cooperatives, and regional cooperatives should be established as soon as possible.

Later, they gathered a crowd last winter to rob the Xinrongchang Tobacco Shop at 190 Lane 1080 on Jiangning Road. A shop assistant, Guo RuHan, shouted for help and was shot and injured by them. Finally, the six criminals were dividing the loot at the entrance of Lane 841 on Zhejiang North Road after robbing Anqing Road, when the Laoza Bureau detected it. Branch Director Shi Sijian and Deputy Branch Director Yan Chengsheng ordered Section Chief Jiang Shangpei to supervise the section members Zhang Kuidong, police officers Sun Juemin, Xu Daren, Chou Mingcai, police officers Du Guozhen, Yu Tiechen, etc. to arrest the six criminals one after another.</p>

<h3>Three Yu Garrison Wounded in Bandit Suppression: Battalion Commander Ye Comes to Shanghai for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Liang Lingguang bandit army of Northern Jiangsu sneaked into Sanyu Town, more than 40 miles northeast of Nantong City, on the night of the 17th. After a brave interception by the garrison, the reinforcements of the national army arrived, and fierce battles from the morning of the 18th until 6:00 p.m. finally defeated the bandits. During the fierce battle, Ye Guisheng, the Battalion Commander of the x Regiment x Battalion of our Provincial Security Team, was seriously wounded in the head. He was transferred from the battlefield to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:30 p.m. and was admitted to Renji Hospital for treatment. The reporter visited him last night. At that time, Battalion Commander Ye was being injected by a nurse, and he was still conscious. According to reports, he was ordered to lead his troops to Sanyu Town for reinforcements at 4:30 a.m. on the 18th. When he arrived three miles away from the town, he encountered the bandit army and began to make contact. Until 3:00 p.m., the bandits gradually retreated to the northeast. When they arrived at Sanyu Town at 6:00 p.m., he was unfortunately shot and wounded. He hopes to recover soon so that he can return to the front line and continue to serve the country. Ye is 28 years old this year. He was wounded in the head and right shoulder, with a total of three bullets. One bullet has been removed.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Shelter Collapses: Three Refugees Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the wasteland near Xiaomu Bridge on Xietu Road in Nanshi, a large number of air raid shelters were dug during the enemy's occupation. After the victory, they were not demolished or filled in. Recently, dozens of refugees from Northern Jiangsu have been living there to avoid the wind and rain because it is difficult to find a house. Unexpectedly, due to continuous spring rain, the soil became loose and rotten. Suddenly, at about 8:15 a.m. yesterday morning, one of the earth shelters suddenly collapsed, and refugees Zhang Daiqing (44 years old), Zhou Zhongcai (63 years old), and Zhou Zhangshi (32 years old) were injured on the spot. After being discovered by their companions, an ambulance was urgently summoned to the scene to send the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is said that only Zhang Daiqing was slightly injured and was discharged after being bandaged by the doctor. The other two, Zhou Zhongcai and Zhou Zhangshi, were seriously injured, and their lives were in danger.</p>

<h3>Engineering Circle Grand Event: Chinese Technology Association: Holds Second Anniversary: Two Movements Hope for Support from All Sectors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The second anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Technology Association was held at the Central Research Institute on Yueyang Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The attendees included the association's full members Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, Zhuang Zhihuan, Gu Yuxiu, Wu Zhesheng, He Shangping, Hu Juewen, Wang Shengsan, Wang Ziyang, Zai Hanmin, Zhou Ren, etc., and 250 basic members. First, Song Mingshi, the chairman of the Technology Association, reported on the activities of the past year, stating that although the material conditions were extremely difficult at the beginning of the Technology Association, it successively held the Chinese Chemical Laboratory, technical vocational schools, and exhibitions. The number of Technology Association members has increased from hundreds to 2,500 in the past year, and they are now actually participating in various production works. Therefore, it has become an inseparable part of the entire social life. However, the living conditions of technical personnel are poor, and there is an urgent need to initiate: (1) a technical personnel life subsidy movement, (2) raising funds, developing businesses, and expanding the association, in order to strengthen unity, overcome difficulties together, wait for the arrival of the new era, contribute what they have learned, and serve the country. It is hoped that these two movements can receive enthusiastic support from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Technical Education: Popularize Society</p>
<p>Then, Zhuang Zhihuan, the general manager of the Technology Association and the director of the Technology Department of the Bank of Communications, said that at this stage, if China wants to build a large-scale industry, both human and material resources are insufficient. It is better to start with the development of small and medium-sized industries. However, simply relying on technical personnel to promote the construction of industrialization is not as effective as popularizing technical education in society first. He suggested that the Technology Association should do more work on "socializing technical training" so that the public can recognize the importance of production, engage in production together, increase the middle class, and establish the stability of society.</p>
<p>Coordinate with National Policy: Engage in Production</p>
<p>Subsequently, Gu Yuxiu quoted Datong Pian, "Hate that the force does not come from oneself, not necessarily for oneself," to encourage the Technology Association to work hard, so that the entire society can move from "everyone has food to eat" to "everyone has food to eat." Zhao Zukang called on the Technology Association to: (1) strengthen cooperation, (2) have the spirit of Christ, to unite the national technical youth and advocate a "New May Fourth Movement" to move towards the goal of "Industrial Revolution" together. Finally, Zhao Zengjue put forward three points: (1) pay attention to the cultivation of people, (2) use foreign capital as the forerunner of China's industry, and (3) take into account production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales in the production process. He Shangping, Hu Juewen, and others also gave speeches, all encouraging all members to work hard without complaint, enrich themselves, stick to their posts, coordinate with national policies, and engage in production work. After the meeting, the Association resumed the gathering at the Law Society on Huangpi South Road for a dinner party, and held a charity sale and raffle. The entertainment began at 2:00 p.m., with dance, singing, drama and other programs, and ended at 5:00 p.m. This was the annual grand event in the engineering circle.</p>
<h3>Bandit Groups Rob Cotton: Activity at Various Wharves: Decision to Strictly Arrest According to Law</h3>
<p>Since the National Cotton and Yarn Management Committee implemented the unified purchase and distribution of cotton, a large amount of cotton purchased from various places has recently been transported to Shanghai. When the cotton arrived at various wharves for unloading and transfer, it was discovered that there were unemployed hooligans who gathered to violently rob and plunder, and the losses were very large. Yuan Liang, the chairman of the committee, was very angry. After consulting with the municipal government to strictly stop it, the municipal government ordered the municipal police bureau to start investigating the hooligan groups robbing cotton at various wharves from today. They will be arrested and punished on the spot in the future and will never be lenient. It is reported that this group of illegal hooligans is an organized group, and the number of people in the so-called "Thirty-Six Gangs" is even more numerous. This hooligan group is using refugees and bums to operate at various wharves. It is heard that the Hong Kong Zheng Association's investigation team has also set up a method to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Adapting to the Transportation Needs of the National Games: The Public Works Bureau Decides to Increase Public Buses</p>
<p>The first National Games after the war will be held in this city. The means of transportation in this city should be deployed as soon as possible. Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Public Works Bureau, is actively planning to increase and improve the municipal public buses. It has been decided to increase 50 public buses before the end of this month, and another 40 public buses will be added before the opening of the National Games on May 5. The original public buses will be repaired heavily, and all half-windowed ones will be retrofitted with full glass windows. Also, on the opening day of the National Games on May 5, all city vehicles, ferries, and small trains will change their routes to connect with the traffic at the Jiangwan Stadium.</p>

<h3>Discarding Anxious Thoughts: Hard Work Will Surely Lead to Success – Cheng Tianfang Speaks on "Anxiety and Hope"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Dr. Cheng Tianfang, at the invitation of the Qingnian Hall Academic Forum on Huashan Road, gave a lecture on "Anxiety and Hope," analyzing the causes of young people's anxieties, explaining the unnecessary nature of such feelings, and encouraging young people to strive for a brighter future. The main points of his speech are recorded below: (The picture is of Cheng Tianfang)</p>
<p>"Since returning to China last year, I have found that many young people I have come into contact with generally have feelings of anxiety and suffering. There are two main reasons for this: one is personal, such as family discord, financial difficulties, romantic setbacks, etc.; the other is due to the state of the nation and society. Because in the two and a half years since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the country has failed to achieve peace and reconstruction, but is instead engulfed in war, affecting traffic congestion, economic bankruptcy, political corruption, rising prices, and the decline of social morality. Young people are even more anxious and pained to witness this situation.</p>
<p>In fact, feelings of anxiety and suffering are not unique to Chinese youth; the youth of other countries around the world are no different. What I saw in Europe and the United States was that, for example, in Britain after the war, there was a shortage of materials, no coal for heating in winter, and food was rationed, with only one egg per week. In France, due to war damage, resources were even scarcer than in Britain. In Germany, after defeat, under the control of others, it goes without saying. In the Soviet Union, there were many beggars on the streets, and the people's lives were also very hard. In the United States, although material life could still maintain pre-war levels, there was also spiritual unease because communism was expanding and spreading day by day after the war, and a third world war could break out at any time, so they were constantly worried. So, in short, the youth of all countries in the world have their own suffering and anxiety. However, we must not be too anxious and take the road of pessimism, which will only lead to self-destruction. We should believe that there is hope in everything, and that the future is bright.</p>
<p>Lincoln's Childhood Was Difficult</p>
<p>In terms of personal anxiety, we believe that as long as one is determined and willing to work hard, no matter how difficult the environment, there is hope of solving the problem and succeeding. There are many such precedents in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. For example, US President Lincoln had a very bad childhood environment. His family lived in a thatched shack, and he started working at the age of six or seven, without the opportunity to go to school. However, he used his spare time to study hard and finally acquired rich knowledge and wisdom and became the President of the United States. Another example is the great scientist Edison, whose family was also very poor. He worked as a waiter on a train in his teens, and when the passengers were asleep, he did chemical experiments on the train. In such an environment, he worked hard to study and later invented eight hundred kinds of scientific instruments, benefiting mankind. Another example is our leader, Chairman Chiang, whose childhood environment was also not good. He lost his father at the age of eight, leaving behind a widow and orphans, and life was difficult. But he did not lose heart or ambition and finally achieved his later career. Therefore, no matter how difficult the environment, as long as you set your sights far and wide, do not be discouraged by trivial matters, and take your life's career as your goal, you will surely achieve success through hard work.</p>
<p>Although the Country Is Chaotic, the Future Is Still Hopeful</p>
<p>In terms of the overall national situation, although the current situation is chaotic, the future is still bright and hopeful. This can be seen from several things: First, our current international status is unprecedented in a hundred years. Foreign privileges in China have been completely abolished. Second, although our progress in various fields is slower than that of other countries, it is indeed much faster than it was forty or fifty years ago. Forty or fifty years ago, our people's intelligence was very immature. For example, when they saw foreigners' suits and trousers were straight, they thought foreigners' legs were straight. Another example is the fear of photography, thinking that it was foreigners coming to take their souls. Such ideas seem very ridiculous now. In terms of organizational ability, we have also made much progress now. In the past, the so-called "yamen" (government office) was used for two things: litigation and paying taxes. Apart from that, it can be said that it had nothing to do with the people. Although we are still behind other countries now, at least the organization is complete. Third, although communism is expanding and spreading, it will ultimately fail. Because communists are savage and cruel, implementing policies of killing everywhere, and going against human nature, even ordering sons to kill their fathers, wives to kill their husbands, and brothers to kill their brothers. This ideology is not in line with our national conditions and will not gain the sympathy of the people. Therefore, even if its current strength is expanding, it will eventually be eliminated. Furthermore, in terms of Chinese history, the chaotic situations in the past dynasties were even worse than the current one, such as the Rebellion of the Five Barbarians at the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Rebellion of the Five Dynasties at the end of the Tang Dynasty, and the Rebellion of Li Zicheng at the end of the Ming Dynasty, all of which caused national turmoil and social unrest, but in the end, they all recovered and prospered, and returned to normal. Therefore, as long as we work hard and improve politically and economically, we will surely have a bright future in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Democratic Countries Will Surely Win</h3>
<p>The world situation is also like this. As a result of the struggle between communism and democratic countries, I believe that victory will belong to the latter. In the past, because democratic countries could not unite, they allowed communism to expand day by day. However, recently, European countries have been uniting, such as the mutual assistance treaty signed by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and the economic conference held in Paris by sixteen Western European countries, all to defend against Soviet aggression. The United States has a very clear understanding of communism, and in order to defend against communism, its assistance to other countries has also been increasing day by day, so the entire world also has a bright outlook.</p>
<p>Finally, what is worth mentioning is that with the progress of science, mankind has unlimited hope for the future. In the past fifty years, mankind's scientific progress has far surpassed the achievements of the past five thousand years. And the progress in the next fifty years is believed to be even greater than the current fifty years. Especially the atomic energy discovered in this war, I believe that within ten to fifteen years, it will surely be applied to industry and greatly improve human life. According to scientists' estimates, in the future, people will only have to work four hours a day to be able to maintain their lives. Therefore, whether from the perspective of the individual, the country, the world, or the future of mankind, the future is bright and splendid. Young people born in the twentieth century are really very enviable. I hope everyone can discard their worries and make full use of this rare opportunity."</p>

<h3>Gleanings from Burma</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Rangoon, 14th (Airmail)] With the assistance of China National Aviation Corporation, our press corps' trip from Shanghai to Rangoon not only transported us to a new climate, but also gave us a distinctly different taste and impression of life in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Special Cuisine</p>
<p>On the fifth day in Rangoon, an overseas Chinese invited us to his home for a Burmese meal, which was our first taste of Burmese flavor. Burmese cuisine is similar to Chinese cuisine in form, but the taste of the cooking is very different. Its characteristics are spiciness and greasiness, plus an indescribable fishy smell. Some of our colleagues in the press corps were actually able to eat with relish, but the others and I found it very difficult to swallow. However, out of consideration for the host's feelings, we had to force ourselves to eat some to get by. A day later, the Burmese Foreign Minister invited us to his official residence for dinner. This was a great kindness on his part to our Chinese press corps, but for us, it was another ordeal. The meal was considered very lavish in Burma, but it was even more difficult to eat than the meal at the overseas Chinese's home the day before.</p>
<p>Eating with Hands</p>
<p>In order to maintain diplomatic etiquette, we gritted our teeth and forced ourselves to eat, and we also had to suppress any expressions of disgust. We finally managed to get through the dishes and rice when the waiter brought up a small plate of mixed tidbits, containing shredded ginger, sesame seeds, peanuts, and fried noodles. Everyone mixed it with their hands and ate it by grabbing. (Burmese people eat like Indians, all with their hands. When entertaining us, the dishes were served with knives and forks, but these tidbits had to be eaten with hands.) That wasn't all. Finally, the Foreign Minister, to show his respect for the guests, specially brought out a plate of pickled tea leaves to introduce. These tea leaves were pickled until they were black like dried vegetables and were considered a supreme delicacy in their eyes. Ambassador Tu Yuntan was also present that day, and he was sitting next to the Burmese Foreign Minister. I saw that he was also reluctantly accepting the tea, picking up a few leaves and grabbing them for a long time before putting them into his mouth. The most interesting thing was one of our colleagues. He was about to throw up from eating, but he was still spouting diplomatic rhetoric, saying, "Very good! Very good! Almost the same as Chinese cuisine!" When the meal was over and we took our leave, he exclaimed, "Hard labor! Hard labor!" as soon as he got into the car.</p>
<p>Top and Bottom Attire</p>
<p>The attire of the Burmese people is divided into two parts, top and bottom. For the lower half of the body, both men and women wear sarongs, which are made by folding a piece of cloth in half and sewing it together, like a cage that is slipped over the lower half of the body, with a knot tied tightly at the waist. For the upper half of the body, women wear thin gauze long-sleeved shirts, which are wrapped very tightly, so that you can see the small vests covering their chests and backs underneath. Men usually wear something like a Western suit shirt, but when they encounter a formal gathering or ceremony, they add a white mandarin jacket on top, and wrap their heads in a red and green cloth scarf, tied in a knot on the right side. This kind of headgear is quite reminiscent of the Robin Hood-like characters in our martial arts novels or legends.</p>
<p>Burmese Women</p>
<p>I remember that there was an American film starring Dorothy Lamour called "Burma Road," which made viewers fascinated by Burma and gave them endless fantasies about the Burmese people. However, the Burmese women we saw in Rangoon were all ugly. Almost everyone's face was smeared with a kind of bark powder that looked like lime. It is said that this bark powder has a cooling effect. They are all very short, and their facial features do not meet the conditions for beauty. If you had to say something good about them, it would be that the sarongs are wrapped tightly, so their waists are very slender and their curves are still distinct.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Housing</p>
<p>Because of the humid climate in Rangoon, the floors of Burmese people's houses are usually a considerable distance from the ground, and some houses are propped up by pillars, with only one story upstairs, and the stairs are installed outside the house. The majority of Burmese people are poor, and their houses are dilapidated wooden shacks and thatched cottages. As for the wealthy Burmese people or government officials, they live in Western-style houses with the latest equipment.</p>
<p>Big and Small Golden Pagodas</p>
<p>Burma is a Buddhist country. Although the influence of Buddhism has been declining in recent times, you can still see monks in red and yellow robes on the streets of Rangoon at any time, and the most famous sight in Burma is the golden pagoda, a Buddhist sacred site. There is one large and one small golden pagoda in Rangoon. In addition to various Buddha statues, the large golden pagoda also contains all kinds of small pagodas with pointed tops. Anyone must take off their shoes before entering the golden pagoda, otherwise the Burmese people believe that they are desecrating the gods and will attack them in droves. However, the stone steps inside the golden pagoda are very dirty. After we took off our shoes and toured around, the bottoms of our socks were covered with bird droppings and mud.</p>
<p>Vehicles and Police</p>
<p>There are a lot of crows in Rangoon, and they are constantly making noise in the morning and evening. There are also many movie theaters in the urban area. In addition to these, there are two things that are more special. One is the rickshaw, which is different from those in Shanghai. Seats and another wheel are installed on the right side of the rear wheel of the bicycle. The seats are in front of and behind each other, so two people can sit back to back. The other is the traffic police at the intersections. They wave their hands when directing traffic, giving individual directions to each car, so they don't stop for a moment. Their gestures are very funny, but they can last for a long time without getting tired, which shows that they have all undergone some training!</p>
<p>Inside the Presidential Palace</p>
<p>On the noon of the day before we left Rangoon, we went to visit the President of Burma, Sao Shwe Thaik. The President received us in a very small office. He was wearing a Western suit, and the suit was so old that it looked like it was sold on Wusong Road in Shanghai. He was originally a tribal chieftain who had been to Yunnan and could speak the Yunnan dialect. But he claimed that he had forgotten it and spoke to us in English that was not easy to understand. We sat for about ten minutes and then took our leave. It is said that this President has four wives, but when the Burmese people elected him as President, they put forward a condition that he was only allowed to bring one wife into the Presidential Palace, so now only his third wife lives with him. We felt that his life in the Presidential Palace seemed to be very lonely. (Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong)</p>

<h3>Shaoxing Jianhu Town Troop Leader Buys Draftees, Loses Both People and Money: Offender Zhou Linchang Interrogated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 20th] Luo Ying, a troop leader from Jianhu Town, Shaoxing, came to Hangzhou to buy draftees and was swindled, resulting in a loss of both people and money. Luo came to Hangzhou on the 12th to buy two draftees to fill the quota for the town. Zhou Linchang arranged for this in Hangzhou, entrusting the matter to Jin Xiaomao. Jin then negotiated with Wang A'quan. It was agreed that two draftees would be purchased for 20 million. Luo went on the morning of the 13th, paid 16.5 million in cash and a gold ring weighing two mace and five candareens, and agreed to deliver the people at noon on the 14th. However, when Luo went on time, he lost both people and money, so he reported the matter to the police station. Only Zhou Linchang was arrested, and it was found that Zhou was a professional draftee trafficker. The case is currently being investigated further by the Municipal Criminal Police Team.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Refugee Relief Center Opens</h3>

<h3>Changshu Conscription Conference Organizes Voluntary Plowing Teams</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changshu, 20th] In order to improve conscription administration, the county government specially convened a conscription conference, which decided to establish volunteer soldier registration offices in various districts. The fixed family support fee was set at 80 million, and voluntary plowing teams were organized to replace the draftees who were selected to do spring plowing. Based on a tip-off, Gu Jinshan and 40 other draftees being trafficked were captured in the Zeng Family Garden. They were divided into three groups from Wuxi, Shanghai, and northern Jiangsu. Some of them had received secondary education, but were trafficked to Changshu to enlist as volunteers due to their poor families. The mastermind is at large and is currently being investigated.</p>

<h3>The Main Culprit in the Case of the Murder of Zhao Wenying Has Been Arrested; Remaining Culprits Are Being Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin, 19th] In September of last year, Zhao Wenying, a gentleman from Longhutang Township in the northern part of our county, was strangled and his body was abandoned in the fields. Later, Wenying's son, Yongyao, and the Criminal Police Team arrested the suspects Zhang Chifu, etc. and imprisoned them, but the case has not been closed. Recently, it was learned that the main culprits in the case, Zhou Huangqing and Wan Rongcai, were hiding in Shanghai, living lavishly, and still going in and out of public places with enemy puppet remnants such as Hu Shaochen for gambling. Therefore, the Criminal Police Team and Yongyao went to Shanghai to arrest them. At the same time, Wan Ronglin was also arrested in the Da Jiangnan Hotel in Wuxi. After the initial interrogation, they confessed to conspiring to murder Zhao Wenying. The inside story is complex and involves a wide range of people. The mastermind is Zhou Wangbao, the mistress of Zhou Huangqing and Wan Rongcai (Note: Zhou was a tiger in Changzhou: he was captured and shot by the Changzhenyang Suppression Command last year), who contacted the bandit armies of Li Qin and Xu Yunlong, as well as Zhou and others. The Criminal Police Team is continuing to arrest relevant criminals.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Contests Business Profit Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiaxing, 20th] Because the amount of advance collection of the business profit tax in our county this year is too high, the Chamber of Commerce is fighting for it with the relevant departments.

<h3>Yiyang Landlords Oppose Rent Reduction Movement: Xiao Xun Expresses Determination to Fight for the Farmers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changsha, 21st (Telegram)] Since Xiao Xun, Director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, led the rent reduction movement in Hunan Province, he has gained sympathy from all parties, but the landlord class is generally opposed to it. After the assassination of Deng Meikui in Yiyang, Xiao and Liu Xuru, Director of the Social Affairs Department, made every effort to support him, which led to a scene in which the landlords of Yiyang publicly attacked Xiao. It is learned that these landlords formally petitioned the Yiyang County Council to forward a long document of thousands of words to the Provincial Assembly, refuting "rent reduction to protect tenants." They said that Xiao, as an administrative officer, was also speculating and opportunistically, vilifying the landlords as local tyrants, and regarding struggle as a long-term strategy, using the banner of rent reduction to protect tenants to express his views on a disguised emancipation struggle. Xiao responded to this document by telling reporters in an extremely sad tone: "It is not surprising that the landlords of Yiyang are attacking me, but they have overestimated me." He also expressed his determination to fight to the end for the interests of the farmers of Hunan Province, and will go to Yiyang in person to investigate the Deng case as soon as possible in order to get to the bottom of the case?</p>
<h3>News in Brief</h3>
<p>Hangzhou [Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, Zhejiang Province received an order from the Executive Yuan to publicly display the head as a barbaric method of execution in the old days, which is detrimental to international opinion, and specially instructed its subordinates to strictly prohibit it.</p>
<p>Jiashan [Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Dishan, a clerk in the Land Registration Office, recently committed suicide by hanging himself on the morning of the 20th because of his difficult life. He took advantage of the opportunity when his children went to school and his wife went to the market to buy groceries. When his wife returned home and discovered it, she was unable to save him.</p>
<p>Bengbu [Our Newspaper Report] The concentration military training for civil servants in Bengbu City is ready. At 2:00 p.m. on the 19th, the personnel from various agencies who were to receive military training gathered at the Bengshan Stadium to form a team, and military training will begin in the next few days.</p>
<p>Dangtu [Our Newspaper Report] On the 12th, Qin Zhongyu, a bandit leader, was captured in Room 12 of the Jiangdong Inn on Dongda Street in the city. He had previously joined forces to rob unpolished rice and killed people and threw them into the water. On the 17th, at about 12:00 midnight, Jin Yuxi, a member of the gang, was also captured in Daxinbao, Daqiao Township. Both were sent to the county government for handling. It is reported that each was worth fifteen to sixteen million.</p>
<p>Suxian [Our Newspaper Report] The spring famine in our county is serious. The young people who have fled from the bandit areas to the city have no way to make a living and are selling themselves (to become draftees) to survive. "Recruitment brokers" are rampant.</p>
<p>Chongming [Our Newspaper Report] The language of our county is indistinguishable from that of Qidong and Haimen Counties in northern Jiangsu, making it extremely easy for bandits from Qidong and Haimen to infiltrate. Although the garrison has repeatedly searched, the results have been minimal. Recently, it has been heard that someone has suggested that the authorities strictly compile and check the population of the villages along the northern border. If this can be effectively implemented and persisted in, it will definitely help maintain local order.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Attend the Central Research Institute Council Meeting: Hu Shih Arrived in Shanghai by Plane from Beiping Yesterday; Li Shuhua and Li Zongen Came South on the Same Flight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Hu Shih, President of Peking University, Li Shuhua, President of the Beiping Research Institute, and Li Zongen, President of Peking Union Medical College, traveled together on an air overlord plane and arrived in Shanghai from Beiping at 6:10 p.m. yesterday. Hu will preside over the board meeting of Peking Union Medical College to be held in Shanghai on the 24th. After the meeting, he will travel to Nanjing with Li Shuhua to attend the Second Council Meeting of Academicians of the Central Research Institute to be held in Nanjing on the 25th to elect 100 academicians of the institute. After the Council Meeting, he will stay in Nanjing to attend the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Hu Shih's spirit was better this time than last year. He looked happy when he got off the plane. At the request of reporters, he took a group photo with Li Shuhua and Li Zongen. He then smiled and said, "After returning to Beiping from Shanghai last year, I had a serious illness. After recovering, I stopped smoking and drinking." After speaking, he got into the car and left. In the evening, reporters visited Hu Shih's residence at the International Hotel again.</p>
<p>Peking University's Finances Are Extremely Tight</p>
<p>Regarding the tight financial situation of Peking University, Hu Shih said: "We are extremely poor." The Ministry of Education approved 572.4 million yuan per month for the operating expenses of Peking University in the first half of the 37th year, but the expenses for February alone, for water and electricity, were 1.13 billion yuan. The school could not pay and had to incur debt. The life of the professors is miserable. Hu Shih's own monthly salary is 12 million yuan. It is said that this monthly salary is equivalent to about 15 yuan in pre-war legal tender, which can at most buy five bags of flour. The general salary of professors is around 10 million yuan. If they have three children, it is simply impossible to manage. The lives of other staff and students are even more unsustainable, and "academic research is out of the question." Hu Shih said that future problems cannot be solved by adjusting and increasing salaries. He said: When he took over as President of Peking University two years ago, his salary was only 280,000 yuan per month. In just over a year, it has increased to 12 million yuan. The adjustment has not been slow, but it still cannot solve the problem. The government should seriously consider the new method of universal distribution of goods in kind. Hu Shih brought a lot of relevant materials this time, which will be provided to the "supervisory authority" for reference. He also said: "Everyone must sit down and have a good talk." As for the source of goods in kind and how to implement an effective distribution method, Hu Shih believes that the government and experts should conduct thorough research.</p>
<p>When Will the Atomic Building Be Realized?</p>
<p>The reporter then visited Li Shuhua, who said: The Beiping Research Institute previously planned to build an atomic building in Beiping. All architectural drawings and atomic research plans have been drafted, but they have been shelved due to lack of funding. He sighed with emotion. In addition to attending the National Assembly and the Council Meeting of Academicians of the Central Research Institute, Li will also discuss with Li Shizeng the date of this autumn's academic conference of the Beiping Research Institute.</p>

<h3>Government Decides to Allocate 800 Billion to Fund Universal Education; Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu Officially Announces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu recently stated that the government has decided to allocate 800 billion yuan to fund universal education. Hang pointed out that the government has long recognized the importance of universal education, and therefore, despite difficult wartime financial circumstances, still engaged in a five-year literacy campaign. From 1940 to 1944, the number of literate adults nationwide increased from 100 million to approximately 161 million, an increase of 60%. The number of literate school-age children increased from 13 million to 16 million, an increase of approximately 30%. He used the phrase "Education for Democracy" to explain the aim of future constitutional governments to strive for universal education. He also stated that the universal education plan will include reducing illiteracy, popularizing science, and training good citizens.</p>
<h3>UN Education Organization to Elect New Secretary-General; Hope Hu Shih and Y. C. James Yen Will Participate in the Election</h3>
<p>Dr. Kuo Yu-shou Reveals Opinions of British and American Figures</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Paris, 12th] The Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will be up for re-election this year. Relevant British and American figures greatly hope that one of the two Chinese figures, Hu Shih and Y. C. James Yen, will come forward to participate in the election. Dr. Kuo Yu-shou reported this exciting news to Chinese residents in France today. Dr. Kuo stated: If we can mobilize early at home and abroad, and work separately, then Mr. Hu or Mr. Yen has a great chance of success. Dr. Kuo Yu-shou made this announcement at the "Paris Commemoration Ceremony for the Death of the Founding Father of the Republic of China" held at the Chinese Embassy in France, led by Ambassador Chien Tai, who also introduced Dr. Kuo. Dr. Kuo also recounted the details of the Second UNESCO General Conference in Mexico. He then stated: Although there are five official languages of the United Nations, the so-called "working languages" of "UNESCO" are only English and French. During the conference in Mexico City last year, Hang Liwu requested that Chinese be formally listed as one of the working languages, while the United States, Central America, and South American countries strongly sought to add Spanish. This year's entire budget for UNESCO is US$7.6 million, and China's membership dues account for 7%, which should be US$500,000. However, there are currently only six Chinese staff members at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. Dr. Kuo also stated that Yugoslavia and Poland had previously had many objections to the implementation of UNESCO's work. The biggest difficulty currently facing UNESCO is the volatility of international politics, which often affects the League's work plans. For example, recently UNESCO planned to start work in Germany, but the Czech Republic and Poland firmly opposed it. How to prevent international politics from affecting the progress of UNESCO remains without concrete ideas.</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices Maintain Steady Trend at the Beginning of the Week; Violent Fluctuations Return on the Weekend</h3>
<p>Last week was the fifth week after the Lunar New Year. The violence of the price fluctuations after the Lunar New Year is truly unprecedented. In terms of the magnitude of the price index increase during this price fluctuation cycle, only the price surge in the spring of 1946, with an increase of 120%, can be compared. However, that surge was due to the fact that factories that had moved inland during the war were still on their way back east after the victory. Production along the coast had not yet returned to normal, and the large number of people who had moved inland during the war were returning east, causing a rapid increase in consumption along the coast. At the same time, legal tender was flowing eastward from the interior in large quantities, creating a violent price surge. Although the increase in the general price index during that price fluctuation cycle was over 100%, it lasted for 12 weeks. This was a relatively exceptional fluctuation. Since then, there was another major fluctuation in the second half of 1946 and three major fluctuations in 1947. During these four major fluctuations, the percentage increase in the total price index ranged from 42% to 80%. The fluctuation cycle was shortened from 12 weeks to 6 weeks, and the interval between each two cycles gradually shortened from three months to five or six weeks. In the recent price increases over the short three weeks after the Lunar New Year, the total price index has already increased by more than 100%. By the previous week, the fourth week, food prices had fallen slightly, and fuel prices remained stable, but textiles continued to skyrocket, with no sign of entering a quiet period. Last week, prices mostly continued to skyrocket, as if this price fluctuation cycle had not yet ended. How much the total price index will increase during this cycle by the time it ends is still unknown. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in past price fluctuation cycles, and the severity of this phenomenon is indeed unprecedented. It is worthy of special attention from the financial authorities.</p>
<p>Looking back, how have the financial authorities responded to this serious situation? To encourage exports, the Joint Treasury of Four Banks drafted measures last week for export goods to settle foreign exchange loans. This, like production loans, will affect the loosening of credit. Because the import volume of industrial raw materials and production equipment within the allocated quota cannot meet the general needs of industry, last week, according to sources from the Ministry of Finance, the government has agreed in principle to allow the import of goods with self-provided foreign exchange in the short term. However, the foreign goods imported with this self-provided foreign exchange are limited to industrial production equipment. This decision is likely to stimulate the black market for foreign exchange. Furthermore, more than three months have passed since the establishment of the Yarn Control Committee, and the implementation measures for subcontracting and weaving have not yet been announced and implemented. However, the unified purchase and sale of raw cotton needed by yarn factories was implemented first, strictly prohibiting yarn factories from purchasing on their own, resulting in a daily shortage of cotton in yarn factories and creating a serious shortage of raw cotton. The above measures do not seem to have shown any practical effect on stabilizing prices. In particular, the price increase limit on the yarn and cloth market, which was only stipulated on Thursday that the daily increase should not exceed 5% of the previous day's closing price, was relaxed after only two days due to the fact that it was impossible to implement in practice. Given the current situation of dwindling raw cotton reserves, the violence of the yarn and cloth price surge is unlikely to be contained by such rigid regulations from the government. Furthermore, the Joint Treasury of Four Banks passed a resolution last week to raise deposit interest rates to stabilize prices. Whether this measure can achieve the expected results is also questionable. According to the theories of Swedish economists such as Wicksell, in order to maintain price stability, the market interest rate should be raised to the level of the so-called equilibrium interest rate or neutral interest rate. There is no doubt that the current deposit interest rate is far below Wicksell's equilibrium interest rate. However, in a state of inflation, the equilibrium interest rate is a variable number. If deposit interest rates are raised to stabilize prices, the result may be similar to the meager effect of raising the exchange rate in order to eliminate the foreign exchange black market. The result may be that the higher the deposit interest rate, the faster the price surge, that is, the higher the equilibrium interest rate. The former will ultimately not be able to catch up with the latter. Moreover, the current equilibrium interest rate has exceeded 100% per month, and the deposit interest rate cannot be raised to such a high level. Therefore, all of the above measures are worth re-examining.</p>
<p>Last week, because the price increases in this city the previous week were too large, far exceeding those in the interior, speculative funds flowed inland in large quantities to purchase goods, mostly to Hankou, Chongqing, and Kunming. This point can be seen from the increase in exchange rates in the above-mentioned places. Credit in this city was tight last week, with a net outflow of 610 billion, an unusually high peak. Food prices fell even more sharply after the decline at the end of the previous week. However, buying sentiment in the yarn and cloth market rebounded, and prices rose again. The tight situation did not ease on Tuesday and Wednesday, and food prices fell again. Yarn and cloth declined slightly on Tuesday, but the tight situation eased slightly on Wednesday afternoon, and yarn and cloth rose again. Since then, whether it was food, yarn and cloth, rayon, or factory supplies, all hit new highs daily. The weekend saw even more frantic price increases, and the above-mentioned goods markets were all in a state of frenzy. White rice rose from 3.145 million per shi at the end of the previous week to 4.15 million at the end of last week. Retail prices even reached 4.4 million. Navy wheat flour rose from 1.43 million per bag at the end of the previous week to 1.59 million last week. The most frantic price increases were in yarn and cloth. During the same period, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 177 million to 227 million, and Longtou fine cloth rose from 3.39 million per yard to 4.4 million. However, because prices were lower at the beginning and middle of the week, the price index for last week did not increase much compared to the previous week, and the food index actually fell. The reason is that the price index compiled by this society only includes the five days from Monday to Friday and does not include Saturday due to time constraints. Other commodities, such as coal, were most stable in price because the weather was warmer and demand decreased. Jiaozuo Po coal was stable at around 13 million per ton. 693 sulfuric acid was also stable in price at around 52 million yuan per barrel due to seasonal factors and lower demand. However, the prices of most chemicals generally increased significantly.</p>

<h3>Currency and Finance: Capital Flows in but Credit Remains Tight; Reduced Inflow and Continued Rise in Shadow Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Last week, the city's credit situation could have eased with the inflow of exchange difference from national banks and the continuous arrival of floating capital from other regions. However, the rising price trend, stimulated by various factors, remained relentless. Even the grain prices, which had barely stabilized for three or four days, rose again. The rumor that yarn factories would soon run out of raw cotton caused cotton cloth to rise even more sharply. Those short on goods scrambled to borrow funds to buy, while sellers preferred to bear high interest rates and raise prices drastically. As a result, general prices did not fall due to the tight credit, and the continued rise in prices, in turn, tightened credit further and made funds even scarcer. The influx of floating capital and the reduction of inflows from national banks did slightly alleviate the dry situation in the market. However, commercial firms generally lacked orders throughout the week, and the daily amount of cash delivered to the Central Bank to offset orders was only several hundred billion, except for over one hundred billion on Monday. Interbank lending was also not easy. The increase in bounced checks in the clearinghouse could temporarily alleviate the predicament, but it was not a permanent solution. Therefore, it was necessary to seek assistance from sporadic funds outside the industry. As a result, the shadow interest rate hovered above 30%, remaining high for a long time. Securities arbitrage also remained at a high level of 30%. On Friday, the interest rate difference between long and short positions in securities reached an unprecedentedly high of 39%.</p>
<p>Last week, the exchange difference of national banks was relatively large only on Monday, with an inflow of 446.9 billion. The interbank inflow on Tuesday was only 28.5 billion, which was insignificant. From Wednesday to Friday, after deducting commercial banks' fixed deposits at the Central Bank, there was a real outflow of more than 10 billion each day. This was significantly different from the inflow situation of national banks in the previous two weeks. Although the inflow amount of national banks decreased, the total outflow of commercial banks' indirect exchange groups remained around 1.5 trillion, indicating the tightness of credit. As for foreign banks' exchange situation last week, except for Tuesday, when there was an outflow of 58.5 billion, setting a record for outflows since February, there were large inflows on other days. The inflow amount from Wednesday to Friday was 120 to 130 billion per day. It is said that the outflow of capital to the south is still intense.</p>
<p>Internal and External Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the exchange rate for foreign currencies saw the base rate rise again on Wednesday, with the US dollar fixed at 255,000 national currency units, an increase of about 30%. The exchange rate between British and American currencies remained unchanged, with the British pound at 765,000 national currency units. The Hong Kong exchange rate also continued to shrink. On Monday, 100,000 legal tender units were equal to HK$1.22, which shrank to HK$1.13 on Thursday. The market price of US dollars was HK$5.77 on Monday, shrinking to around HK$5.56 on Thursday. Last week, the internal exchange rate of commercial banks in this city fluctuated significantly. The Guangzhou exchange rate was 200 units per 1,000 on Monday, and 280 units on Friday. The Xiamen exchange rate was 200 units on Monday, rising to 300 units on Thursday and Friday. The Hankou exchange rate also rose from 90 units on Monday to 120 units on Wednesday and Thursday. The Chongqing exchange rate was highest at 70 units on Tuesday and lowest at 40 units on Thursday. Generally speaking, the exchange rates in various places showed an upward trend, mainly due to the continued outflow of capital to the south and the reduced discount rate of the Shanghai exchange rate in various places. The discount rate of the Tianjin exchange rate increased significantly last week, which may be related to the outflow of floating capital from the north to the south.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese stock market was indeed affected by the tight credit situation, but due to the influx of floating capital and apparent buying interest, the general trend was still positive. For example, on Monday, although national banks had a huge inflow difference, nine stocks, including China Cement, still reached the limit. In addition, the continued shrinkage of the Hong Kong exchange rate and the sharp rise in yarn prices also provided new stimulus to Chinese stocks. For example, Yongxing Yarn closed at 1,428 yuan at the end of the previous week, and the closing price at the end of last week was 1,860 yuan, an increase of about 30%. The increase rates of Jingfu and Jinglun during the same period were also about 30%, while Xin Guang was 20%. Large stocks such as Mei Ya closed at 3,400 yuan on Friday last week, also up nearly 30% compared to the closing price at the end of the previous week.</p>
<p>The performance of foreign stocks last week was not as good as that of Chinese stocks. It is said that because the price difference between Hong Kong and local counters was very large, many stocks were shipped to the local market for sale, resulting in lower local prices. For example, Yishun closed at 1.85 million at the end of the previous week and 1.96 million at the end of last week, an increase of about 6%. The increase rates of other Yishun, British-American Tobacco, and Jardine Matheson during the same period were all below 5%, which was significantly different from the increase rate in the previous week.</p>

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Trends</h3>
<p>Raw Material "Panic"</p>
<p>In today's generally declining industrial landscape, the textile industry can still be considered to maintain a small-scale prosperity. However, with the passage of time, the industry has also fallen into a predicament surrounded by enemies on all sides! As everyone knows, the Japanese textile industry, with the generous support of the United States, has already made strides in reconstruction. To this end, the Chinese Textile Institute convened a symposium on the 11th of this month specifically to discuss the "US Support for the Japanese Textile Industry" issue. The conclusion was that the reconstruction of the Japanese textile industry should be limited to 3.5 million spindles to meet its domestic needs. At the same time, it was believed that the Chinese government should encourage the profits earned by the textile industry to be used extensively for the construction and development of the textile industry. Limiting oneself to fiscal revenue alone would be akin to killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. However, the fact has become very obvious that "the US disregards the future of the Chinese national industry" and it is "one of its current national policies." According to a New Asia News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 16th, the Osaka Textile Industry Association held a meeting with the Cotton Fabric Industry Alliance to discuss the production plan for this year's export of cotton cloth. It was decided that the production target for this year would be 955,510,700 yards. It is understood that China is also included among the destinations for sales in Asia. Therefore, the focus of hope has to be placed on "self-reliance." However, in the past week, the delayed implementation of substituting weaving for spinning has caused an extreme panic in the textile industry regarding raw materials. The Six District Cotton Spinning Association and the National Textile Industry Federation have convened meetings one after another to discuss countermeasures. It is understood that the raw cotton stored in various factories in this city is, at most, enough for two months, and at least only enough for two or three weeks. According to a certain authority in the textile industry, if this situation is not dealt with quickly, various factories may have to stop production. The yarn factories in this city employ about 90,000 people, and the related reproduction industry and hardware industry employ a considerable number of people. Once the yarn factories stop production, it will have a serious impact on public order. According to him, the current sharp rise in yarn prices is also due to the depletion of cotton in the yarn factories, leading to a rush purchase by people outside the industry. In addition, the cotton spinning industry is calling on the authorities to immediately exchange yarn with foreign countries for 200,000 bales of Indian cotton, otherwise the Six District Association will handle it automatically, because the Indian government has announced a ban on the export of Indian cotton starting at the end of March. Indeed, the problem has reached a point where it must be solved. The difficult situation is very common in every corner. In addition to the cotton spinning industry, the National Cement Industry Association has also called on the government to provide full assistance to expand cement exports. It is understood that under the current exchange rate, the price sold abroad, when converted to legal tender, is not even half of the cost. Taking the situation in the Philippines as an example, American cement in paper bags of 50 kilograms sells for US$2, which, when settled at the latest exchange rate, yields only 390,000 national currency units. However, the current cost of domestic exports is 550,000 units per bag, plus insurance, loading, unloading, and the huge transportation costs between Shanghai and the Philippines, making it impossible to compete with others. Therefore, the industry requests that all foreign exchange earned from cement exports should be allocated to export manufacturers for the purchase of equipment and raw materials such as gypsum paper bags. This request coincides with the rumored opening of the self-provided foreign exchange issue. Furthermore, it is said that the Export Control Committee's plan to use self-provided foreign exchange to purchase production equipment is entirely aimed at increasing domestic production and not stimulating the black market. All general foreign private funds, domestic private foreign currency, and gold are not the targets of opening up. Then "this matter is very complicated," and if the authorities slightly restrain their desire to obtain foreign exchange funds, it may not be difficult to "carefully study" and "reach an agreement"!</p>
<p>The prices of industrial products have seen soap prices increase unprecedentedly in the past week, in addition to the alarming rise in cotton yarn and cloth. According to the Four District Soap Industry Association, there are two reasons for the sharp rise in soap prices: one is the soaring price of raw materials. For example, tallow was 4 million per dan at the end of the lunar year last year, and now it exceeds 16 million, an increase of more than four times. At the same time, there are rumors that the quota for oil and wax in the fourth quarter will be reduced. Coconut oil has also skyrocketed, from 6 million per dan at the end of the lunar year to 23 million to date. The second reason is the difficulty in capital turnover, resulting in shrinking production and reduced output, which naturally leads to a sharp rise in prices. Obviously, this is the same difficulty encountered by all industrial sectors. However, this difficulty cannot be solved by the circular formula of one thing rising in price because another thing also rises in price. In other words, the universal rise in prices cannot be achieved by universally stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>"Acquisition" of Tung Oil</p>
<p>Regarding the acquisition of export materials, the targets were originally limited to seven important items, including tung oil, pig bristles, raw silk, soybeans, eggs, and wool. Last week, tung oil was tried out first. It is said that because the foreign price of tung oil has fallen sharply, it has reached a point where it must be acquired. The Appraisal Committee for the Acquisition of Important Export Materials was established on the 13th. The acquisition areas are limited to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou, and it is stipulated that acquisitions will not be made in the interior to avoid competing with merchants for profits. It is understood that the China Trust Bureau has acquired 300 tons of tung oil applied for by exporters. According to a spokesperson for the China Trust Bureau, the implementation of this method can help export materials to be sold in large quantities overseas without being restricted by the foreign exchange rate.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to cooperate with the authorities' measures to encourage manufacturers to export, ten domestic product manufacturers in this city have jointly established an export organization to promote exports. Naturally, manufacturers are working hard. Under the predicament of domestic raw material shortages, soaring production costs, and sharply reduced output and output, it is not a small compensation if they can find a way out in the foreign market. However, what is the actual effect of the various measures taken by the authorities and manufacturers? Opinions vary, and there are many different views. According to the general manager of HSBC, although China's overseas trade is under control, it is doubtful whether encouraging exports and reducing imports will be effective due to inflation.</p>
<p>The "Mission" of Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>Whether industrial loans will be opened is still uncertain, but agricultural loans have already taken concrete shape, and in terms of quantity, the latter also has the upper hand. According to Director Qiao of the Agricultural Loan Department of the Agricultural Bank, this year's grain loan is 5 trillion and the cotton loan is 3 trillion, accounting for 60% of the total loan amount. It is said that although this number is huge, it is impossible to achieve universality given the vastness of our land. Therefore, this year, a focus principle will be adopted, and centralized management is planned. Regarding the future achievements of agricultural loans, Qiao一再强调要健全农工组织，农贷始能得受实惠。It is repeatedly emphasized that in order to ensure the benefits of agricultural loans, it is necessary to improve peasant organizations. Agricultural loans are aimed at farmers, but it is said that farmers lack organization and funds cannot be released. Therefore, it is necessary to go through cooperatives and rural farmers' associations. Farmers must first join cooperatives as members or join rural farmers' associations before they can be granted loans.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to avoid conflicts between branches of the China Farmers Bank and cooperative treasuries in various places, agricultural loan areas will be dominated by the Farmers Bank, and cooperative treasuries will supplement areas where loans cannot be granted. Furthermore, in the same area, if there are institutions of both the China Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Treasury, they will still divide their spheres of influence. That is, loan related to cooperation will be handled by the Central Cooperative Treasury, and cooperative loans clearly stipulated in this year's agricultural loan plan will also be the responsibility of the Central Cooperative Treasury. In addition, on the 19th of this month, in order to review the past and plan for the future, the China Farmers Bank held a bank affairs meeting, and Chairman Chen Guofu and others spoke, believing that agricultural loan work has the responsibility of assisting the government in winning over the people. From this, it can be seen that this year's agricultural loans, which account for 60% of the total loan amount, have an extraordinary mission.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Survey</p>
<h3>Production and Sales Problems of the Silk Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>Our country's raw silk and silk fabrics have always been important export goods. Before the war, the export value of its export commodities often ranked first. The total export volume averaged 150,000 metric tons per year, valued at around 15 million legal currency, accounting for about 14% of the average total export value during the same period, which could offset about 10% of the average total import value during the same period. After the victory, because various factories suffered losses, they were unable to fully recover. Shanghai currently only has 391 silk weaving factories, with a total of more than 6,500 looms. If raw materials and funds can be fully supplied, the monthly output can reach 80,000 bolts. There is still concern that the raw silk produced domestically will be insufficient for weaving. Furthermore, the silk weaving factories have become accustomed to using rayon during the war, and it is difficult to reverse this trend in the short term. Last year, a small amount of rayon was imported from Japan. At the beginning of this year, more than 1,500 boxes were shipped from Italy, and silk weaving industries in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places all received allocations this week. However, due to the depreciation of currency and high costs, production is quite difficult. Recently, the Allied Headquarters decided to resume production in Japan. Japan has a large stock of raw materials. Rayon fabrics are both cheap and good, and are now being dumped in the New York market in the United States. The price of Japanese silk has been reduced from the current price of US$7.55 per pound to US$2.55 per pound, which has caused the American market to no longer consume expensive Chinese raw silk. The target of our country's silk transportation and sales was originally mainly the United States, but now it has been forced to switch to India. However, due to the high production costs in our country, only 5% of the silk shipped to Mumbai, India, has been sold, and the rest remains in Indian branches. In addition, the production of nylon in the United States after the war is also one of the reasons for reducing the need for our country's silk.</p>
<p>Recently, the government has implemented control over silk in order to manage foreign exchange. However, manufacturers are very dissatisfied, which has led to a decrease in production interest. The export volume of silk has decreased even further. The total export volume of raw silk and silk fabrics last year was 21,860.71 metric tons, with a total value of only 359,159,438,000 yuan, and its export value is far less than that of tung oil, pig bristles, and cotton fabrics. Furthermore, with the threat of war in North and East China, there are many plans to move south. As a result, the silk from Shunde, Guangdong, and other places has attracted the attention of the China Import and Export Corporation. The company not only plans to actively promote improved silkworm breeds, but also plans to set up silk weaving factories in Guangdong Province. At the same time, the silkworm seed loan from the Agricultural Bank of China also began to be processed this week, with a maximum monthly interest rate of 7% and a term of six months or nine months. It should be beneficial to the silk weaving industry. From this point of view, the silk weaving industry in the future may be centered in Guangdong Province, exporting to Hong Kong and Macau, and then transshipping to Europe and the United States for application. European countries such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are also our country's main consumption markets for silk.</p>

<h3>Glass in the Atomic Age</h3>
<p>— Wang Chuanyi</p>
<p>In the early days of this World War II, military experts wanted to use glass to manufacture a transparent aircraft that could conceal enemies' ears and eyes. Although this plan was not realized, due to its special hardness, glass has been widely used in aircraft, automobiles, and prosthetics for the disabled, bulletproof vests, bandages required by surgeons, and fillings for cavities. Glass can also be manufactured into fertilizer. This newly advancing glass industry is emerging in various manufactured products at a rapid pace. A larger glass factory can produce 4,000 different types of glass for different uses.</p>
<p>Now is the Age of Glass</p>
<p>The uses of glass are becoming increasingly widespread, so American glass experts boast that after the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Steel Age, humans are now stepping into the Glass Age? At the Glass Improvement Association held at the University of Pittsburgh, its chairman, Dr. Alexander Silverman, predicted that in the next five years, the glass industry will become one of the most important light industries.</p>
<p>Glass can withstand atomic bombs</p>
<p>Dr. Silverman also made a surprising declaration that a special type of glass made from uranium, the raw material for atomic bombs, can withstand the terrible radiation emitted by atomic bombs. He said: "People in atomic bomb explosion areas can wear armor woven from this type of glass and wear a special air cylinder containing a high-frequency dust filter insulated with glass, which can prevent radioactive dust to protect the safety of life."</p>
<p>Glass and Plastics</p>
<p>A recent important invention in industry is the completion of the method of using glass fiber to enhance plastics. This is just like architects using steel bars to strengthen the firmness of concrete. This type of plastic reinforced with glass fiber contains many of the characteristics of metals. It is as light as aluminum and has the strength of the hardest metal we use today. Therefore, modern designers and engineers are competing to use it to manufacture aircraft fuselages, yachts, and various daily utensils. Artisans use this type of glass-reinforced plastic to replace the heat-insulating materials required for old buildings, because it contains heat-insulating properties. This type of plastic can also be used to manufacture lightweight bulletproof vests for soldiers. These bulletproof vests are far superior in performance to bulletproof vests made of metal, and soldiers call them "Doron." It can block 0.45 caliber bullets. For accuracy, this "Doron" is still being tested and improved in the jungles of Colombia.</p>
<p>New Uses of Glass Fiber</p>
<p>American military authorities have recently been experimenting with using glass fiber to weave an Arctic exploration suit that can withstand the cold climate below zero in the Arctic. According to the manufacturer's tests, this suit can maintain the original body temperature at minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Ground glass fiber can also be used as a strengthening agent for special paper to make gramophone records or added to pigments to improve their texture. Surgeons also use it to make wound sutures, special bandages, and plasma filters. Agronomists also predict that in the near future, a special glass fiber can be scattered as fertilizer. This matter is currently being experimented with by Dr. Alfred Badger and Dr. Roger H. Bray. This glass fiber contains the main nutrients of plants and can be dissolved in water and gradually dissolved in the soil to be absorbed by the roots of plants to maintain their life. We believe that soon glass will be widely used as a fertilizer.</p>
<p>Science not only tells us how to use glass to make various objects, but also tells us how to use various special coatings to improve the quality of old-fashioned glass. For example, coating it with a transparent, strong, and electrically conductive coating to make windshields for airplanes and cars, and this type of glass has the characteristic of not freezing. Glass was recognized as a usable material a long time ago, but glass as an important industry is still in its infancy.</p>
<h3>A New Method of Rust Prevention</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Tonggao</p>
<p>Your tap water pipes are rusting, your copper wire screens are falling apart, your aluminum pots are fading, and your cutlery is turning dark...</p>
<p>While these may seem like minor personal issues, they are part of the larger problem of metal corrosion. This larger problem causes billions of dollars in losses each year.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that 40% of all steel produced since 1890 has been lost to rust. The two World Wars, with their unparalleled destructive power, were certainly a major factor in this enormous loss. We are all familiar with the image of piles and piles of war equipment abandoned and rusting away!</p>
<p>Recently, the scientific community has mobilized to attack this enemy of industry and progress. The Illinois Institute of Technology established a corrosion research laboratory in December 1944, and at that time it was the only such laboratory in the United States.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology had previously achieved some brilliant results in this field, but later ceased its work. However, it has now re-established a corrosion research laboratory, and Ohio State University and Lehigh University have also each established one, modeled to some extent on the Illinois Institute of Technology's plan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Case Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado, and the University of Texas are also in the process of establishing such laboratories.</p>
<p>The corrosion research laboratory at the Illinois Institute of Technology studies all kinds of metal corrosion, and today it has made valuable contributions to overcoming rust. Its director is Dr. Hugh J. McDonald, a professor of chemistry.</p>
<p>Why has the problem of preserving steel from rust received more attention only recently? Firstly, because the large quantities of war equipment stored by the U.S. government may soon be needed. Secondly, because the United States' high-quality iron ore, such as that from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, is gradually being depleted.</p>
<p>We can say that most people consider the rusting of metal, especially steel, as a well-known example of a simple natural phenomenon, most likely to occur where moisture is present. But scientific research tells us that it is somewhat more complex. According to Dr. McDonald, the nature of rust is electrochemical.</p>
<p>He illustrates this by comparing it to the failure of an ordinary flashlight battery. The outer casing of the battery gradually corrodes. In this process, electrons flow from the corroding zinc casing to the external circuit and back to the carbon rod in the center of the battery. If a reverse current, slightly stronger than the battery's own, is applied to the battery, experiments have shown that the corrosion process stops.</p>
<p>Since rust is an electrochemical process, it can be prevented in metal just as it can be in a battery, simply by applying a current that opposes the natural current of the rusting metal. This principle has been known for over a century, but it has only recently been formally applied.</p>
<p>Today, one practical application of this principle can be seen in large oil pipelines. Their main enemy has always been rust. These pipelines now rely on electric current to protect their pipes from rust, intermittently using windmills or other power generation devices to produce current along the line.</p>
<p>Although the research at the Illinois Institute of Technology laboratory mainly deals with the corrosion of steel, the problems of other metals are also not ignored, especially the new light metals magnesium and magnesium alloys, because they rust easily.</p>
<p>The main methods used in this laboratory are:</p>
<p>(1) Altering the surface layer. This means making the surface of the metal more resistant than the metal itself. For example, treating aluminum with hot chromic acid.</p>
<p>Internal stress corrosion in steel is due to the presence of small amounts of nitrogen in the metal. Treating the metal surface with hydrogen saturated with water vapor can remove the nitrogen and prevent stress corrosion cracking.</p>
<p>(2) Rust inhibitors. Treating the medium, such as gasoline in pipes, with trace amounts of sodium nitrite can prevent or slow down the electrochemical process. Car radiators can be protected from rust with this compound, or sodium chromate can also be used. The method of rust prevention for the Grand Coulee Dam is to add a rust inhibitor (vitreous phosphate) to the water pipes each time the dam is closed.</p>
<p>The outstanding work of the Illinois Institute of Technology laboratory is the application of rust inhibitors and the study of soft steel internal stress corrosion cracking. Internal stress corrosion cracking is a particularly dangerous type of corrosion cracking, because there are rarely any signs of failure in the metal structure beforehand.</p>
<p>There is also a type of metal cracking caused by molecular separation in the structure, leading to deep corrosion. This is the most abhorrent type of corrosion—expensive, dangerous, and difficult to inspect. It is often the cause of boiler explosions.</p>
<p>Glenn A. Marsh has invented an instrument called the Pulse Polarizer, which uses an electric current to detect corrosion states in metal. This is a completely new method that takes only a fraction of the time compared to previously used methods.</p>
<h3>New Blood Type RH</h3>
<p>— Xue Zhongxun</p>
<p>In 1900, Landsteiner discovered that when the red blood cells of certain people are placed in the serum of others, the red blood cells coagulate into clumps. This reaction only occurs when the red blood cells of a particular person are injected into the serum of a particular other person. After careful research, Landsteiner discovered that there are two independent antigens (Agglutinogen or Antigen), contained in red blood cells, which can cause coagulation when they encounter antibodies (Agglutinin or Antibody) in the serum of others.</p>
<p>In 1901, Landsteiner divided human blood types into three types. Decastello and Stutli pointed out in 1902 that blood type AB is also a type of blood type. In 1907, Jansky, and in 1910, Moss, divided blood types into four categories, namely O, A, B, and AB. Those with antigen A are blood type A; those with antigen B are blood type B; those with both antigens A and B are blood type AB; and those without any antigens are blood type O. People with blood type A do not have antibodies that agglutinate A red blood cells, but they do have antibodies that agglutinate blood type B. People with blood type B do not have antibodies that agglutinate B red blood cells, but they do have antibodies that agglutinate blood type A. People with blood type AB lack both antibodies. People with blood type O have both antibodies simultaneously. The relationship between antigens and antibodies in each blood type is shown in the table below.</p>
<p>Blood type  Antigens in red blood cells Antibodies in serum</p>
<p>O O 2+B</p>
<p>A A B (Anti-B)</p>
<p>B B 2 (Anti-A)</p>
<p>AB A+B None</p>
<p>In terms of genetics, blood type is a multiple alleles. The blood type of children can be calculated from the blood type of their parents. The genotype of each blood type is as follows:</p>
<p>Blood type Genotype</p>
<p>O aa</p>
<p>A AA (or Aa)</p>
<p>B aBaB (or aaB)</p>
<p>AB AaB</p>
<p>The above four blood types are known to ordinary people. In 1940, Landsteiner and Weiner discovered a new blood type. After repeatedly injecting the blood of rhesus monkeys into rabbits and guinea pigs, an immune serum was obtained. This serum can also cause a coagulation reaction with our red blood cells. This new factor has been called Rh since 1941. Tests on 480 Caucasians found that 85% had Rh, and only 15% showed negative results. In 1941, Levine, Vogel, Katzin, and Burnham conducted a large-scale test on 1,035 people, and only 14% showed negative results. Among 113 black people, only 9 showed Rh-negative reactions, which is approximately 8%. In 1942, Landsteiner, Weiner, and Matson tested American Indians in Washington state and its vicinity. Among 120 people, only one showed an Rh-negative reaction. In fact, every red person has an Rh gene).</p>
<p>Regarding the inheritance of Rh blood types, tests were conducted on 237 children in 60 Caucasian families, and it was found that Rh is dominant. Therefore, in terms of this blood type, the genotype can be divided into three categories: RhRh, Rhrh, and rhrh. Race, Taylor, Cappell, and McFarlane pointed out in 1944 that there are seven Rh alleles: Rho, Rhl, Rh2, Rh', Rh", and Rhy.</p>
<p>Because the Rh blood type antigen can cause an antibody in someone's serum to agglutinate red blood cells, doctors should pay close attention to this point when transfusing blood.</p>
<h3>New Methods for Preventing Pests</h3>
<p>— Zhou Guangyu</p>
<p>Farmers who work hard all year round, under the intertwined circumstances of various disasters and oppressions, have a painful experience: the longer they cultivate, the more they have to contend with more pests. Even with hundreds of time-honored and novel insecticides, they have not been freed from their suffering, so some experts have had to seek alternative solutions outside of insecticide use.</p>
<p>The Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station in the United States recently discovered a direct relationship between insect numbers and soil fertility—the lower the fertility, the more insects there are. Crops grown in improperly cultivated soil that has been eroded of its fertility and lacks certain important nutrients are of little nutritional value to humans and livestock, but are extremely attractive to insects, and insects find such crops to be an ideal food source for breeding. This phenomenon, when compared to the fact that feed produced in fertile soil can only be used to make excellent livestock rations, is somewhat absurd, but it is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Insects do not respond to vitamins or other health-sustaining factors in feed in the same way as higher animals. Each insect has its own special nutritional needs. If insects growing in sawdust are forced to eat nutritious meat or fruit, they will starve to death. Even among aphids, one type requires food rich in nitrogen, while another cannot live without carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Based on these revelations, recent research by experts in soil conditions and insects has led to a new offensive against major crop pests. Take the chinch bug, which infests corn, as an example. Ever since agriculture began to develop in the Mississippi Basin in 1850, a serious disaster has occurred every ten years or so. If you were to inspect the cornfields during a summer of infestation, you would see that the most severely affected areas are on the eroded and infertile upper slopes—the corn stalks in that area are covered with chinch bugs, making them both red and black. At the foot of the mountain, where soil fertility is extremely high due to the accumulation of nitrogen and other soil elements washed down, the corn is mostly robust and full of vitality, with chinch bugs attached only to a few weak stems. Previously, many people explained this phenomenon by saying that chinch bugs prefer sunlight and dryness. In fact, the hot midday sun is no more attractive to them than it is to other insects. They often have to hide in the shade to forage. In severe summers, they only start crawling when the sun is obscured or slightly cooler. Similarly, in winter, they often hide in the grass and spend the harsh winter immersed in the frost. From this perspective, the reason why there are so many chinch bugs on decaying corn is not due to excessive sunlight or lack of moisture, but because the sap of that corn is more palatable to them than that of the robust corn at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Chinch bugs often climb onto other crops via nitrogen-rich leguminous plants, which clearly proves that they dislike nitrogen. Therefore, Dr. Stone and L. Haseman in the United States conducted an experiment based on this phenomenon to observe whether increasing nitrogen could prevent chinch bugs. First, an experiment was started on the effect of nitrogen content on chinch bugs, planting corn in nutrient-free sand, moistened with distilled water, and removing the tassels to prevent the absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients from the plant. Then, this detasseled corn was divided into two groups and transplanted into sand moistened with nutrient solutions, one group with a nutrient solution rich in nitrogen and the other group with a nutrient solution without nitrogen. When the corn was growing normally, it was dug up, cut into small sections, and fed to newly hatched chinch bugs. The results showed that those fed with nitrogen-free corn grew vigorously from hatching to old age, matured extremely quickly, and produced a large number of eggs. In the high-nitrogen group, it was difficult to find enough offspring to continue the experiment. This experiment can explain why the reproduction of chinch bugs becomes more vigorous when the source of nitrogen is reduced due to excavation or erosion of the land. At the same time, we can be sure that only by strengthening the lost soil fertility—especially nitrogen—can this pest be prevented.</p>
<p>So far, they have only conducted research on the relationship between chinch bugs and one soil element. The effect of calcium on common greenhouse pasture insects is also being prepared for experimentation. Other examples we have seen in other areas, such as wood borers only infesting weak or dying trees, or cattle lice concentrating on weak and poorly nourished livestock, may also have similar situations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a fact that contradicts this: certain pests (such as the European corn borer) pose a greater threat to crops grown in fertile soil, seemingly refuting the previous experiment and making people believe that applying organic fertilizers to the soil is actually beneficial to pests. However, we should be able to find that there must be a lack of a certain element in this type of soil, or that this consequence is caused by an imbalance of various elements.</p>
<p>When the nutrients in the soil have been exhausted, if we continue to cultivate, the resulting crops that are useless to humans and livestock will promote the occurrence of extremely serious pest infestations in the future. To overcome this vicious cycle, we should quickly restore the fertility of the soil. Only in this way can we more effectively prevent pests without dedicating ourselves to the chemical warfare against pests.</p>

<h3>The Miracle of Paper</h3>
<p>— Shao Yin</p>
<p>What is paper? This is such a bland and meaningless question! You will surely laugh and find the question somewhat foolish. Just pick up a newspaper or the letter paper you are writing on, and you can answer it. But the development of science has led to many miracles of paper, which you may not all know. Let me briefly mention them here.</p>
<p>Speaking of the characteristics of paper, everyone will think of its softness and thinness. It will burn when it encounters fire, it will become fragments when it touches water, it will have creases when it is rolled, and it can be pierced with the flick of a finger. But the facts are not always the case. There is a strange house in Appleton, Wisconsin, in the United States. After the onslaught of summer storms and the erosion of three winter winds, it still stands tall. The house is made entirely of paper. The floors, walls, and roof are all made of paper.</p>
<p>A grain merchant in the Midwestern United States said that once a rainstorm broke the roof of his warehouse, and rainwater immediately seeped into hundreds of bags of grain in paper bags. But as a result, the food inside the paper bags did not get wet at all.</p>
<p>Do you think paper is thin? Think about the houses in Wisconsin? Think about those paper airplanes that fly four hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>Do you think paper is easy to burn? Now even ashtrays are made of paper.</p>
<p>Do you think paper cannot touch water? Think about the paper bags in the grain merchant's warehouse!</p>
<p>Paper scholars declare that the time when we wear paper clothes, use paper plates, paper carpets, paper quilts, and live in paper houses is not far away.</p>
<p>Some of these new products are already available on the market, and they sell very well, because paper is, after all, a cheap thing. Its main raw materials are various closely intertwined fibers, such as trees, cotton pods, flax buds, tobacco roots, hemp, rice straw, and certain clays.</p>
<p>Usually, children's bibs are also made of paper. Those paper bibs can absorb water and are very cheap. They can be thrown away after one use. There are also paper napkins supplied to housewives, which are very practical. They are soft, non-flammable, and washable.</p>
<p>Non-flammable paper is another modern miracle. Light a match on non-flammable paper, and it will scorch a little, but it will never burn. Many non-flammable papers were manufactured during the war to suit military use. The cost of manufacturing non-flammable paper is more expensive than ordinary paper, and the degree of its fire resistance is the standard for how expensive it is. Ordinary non-flammable window curtains are cheaper, non-flammable paper for building houses is more expensive, and paper used for clothing is the most expensive, and its fire resistance is exactly the same as ordinary fabrics.</p>
<p>Replacing cloth with paper is a product in the process of achieving perfect paper clothing. Paper sheets, paper pillowcases, and paper blankets will soon emerge. In fact, there is already a paper blanket for picnics on the market. This paper blanket can also be used as a children's mat and car seat cushion.</p>
<p>Replacing cloth with paper may bring about a reform in dressing habits. It can be used as a shirt to be worn only once, and men's socks (even the most optimistic paper manufacturers do not believe that women will give up Nylon) as well as children's tights.</p>
<p>In the future, paper raincoats, paper hats, and paper galoshes will also be discovered when it rains. Cheap paper coats, which can be discarded after use, will be the most popular among racers and masseurs!</p>
<p>There is now a paper diaper, which is suitable for people to use when traveling with children. Therefore, paper manufacturers are working hard to produce a soft and durable paper diaper, and most importantly, to make it cheap.</p>
<p>In the future, you don't have to worry about the harassment of flies and mosquitoes. Just use a wallpaper containing DDT material, and you can keep your room safe for two years. At the same time, DDT paper can also be used to wrap blankets and clothes to prevent insect infestations.</p>
<p>If someone tells you that fourteen people weighing two hundred pounds are standing on a piece of paper placed on two chairs, you will definitely laugh at him. But in fact, a thin sheet (Lamination) made of many pieces of glued paper has indeed undergone this test. During the war, the development of this thin sheet reached its peak.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of metal, military product manufacturers tried to use paper as the material for airplanes. This seems like an absurd idea, but in fact, every square inch of the sheet can generate 28,000 to 35,000 pounds of tension. With this huge tension, the sheet can also be competent as an airplane material.</p>
<p>In peacetime, thin sheets are very suitable for use as building materials, because its weight is half that of aluminum and less than one-fifth that of steel. In recent years, the advent of paper pipes has also greatly increased the value of paper.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the development process and trend of paper, you can go to the paper chemical factory in Appleton, USA. This is a large institution jointly run by one hundred paper companies, with thousands of scientists inside, exploring new uses of paper day and night.</p>
<p>Three years ago, after the newspapers reported on their first paper house, letters from all over the world were sent to the paper chemical factory to inquire. Some curious people even went to visit it in person. This paper house is most suitable for campers and hunters to purchase, because it is very small and light to use. Its weight is only a few hundred pounds, which is very convenient to transport in a car, and it is also very easy to disassemble, which only takes one or two hours.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the average American family used one-eighth of a ton of paper per year. In 1946, it increased to two-thirds of a ton. Ten years later, it will probably exceed one ton. Looking at the current shortage of paper, some people are also worried about the future supply of paper, but the paper industry has grasped this point and has already increased production.</p>
<p>Paper is truly a strange thing. With the progress of science, in a blink of an eye, the once popular glass world may be replaced by the paper world. This is really good news for the poor who want to live more comfortably, because it is not wasteful and very practical!</p>

<h3>On "Seeing the Big in the Small"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Xuan</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a trend where, whether writing a news item or portraying a person, there is a fondness for focusing on the private life of the subject, writing extensively about minor details. News or articles written in this way are "interesting" and "lively," but they are prone to causing erroneous impressions, either losing the author's original intent or distorting the subject being written about.</p>
<p>In its 25th anniversary issue, the American weekly "Time" magazine discussed that one of the greatest features of its news writing style is its emphasis on "human interest." The reason given was: "A person, in a casual conversation, can sometimes reveal their true intentions more than in grand speeches and writings."</p>
<p>It specifically cited an example to illustrate this point, saying that the amount of writing describing Roosevelt's character in the past fifteen years is innumerable, but the best writing was still the story cited by the magazine in 1933 when Roosevelt first entered the White House. At that time, Mrs. Roosevelt had told a "Time" reporter: "Franklin (Roosevelt's nickname) really likes to give orders to his companions, and the companions are willing to be directed by him. Once I said to him, 'Son, don't always give orders to people, sometimes let others give orders too.' He replied, 'Mom, if I don't give orders, there's nothing fun.'" This personality, those close to him called it "determined," and enemies regarded it as "dictatorial," and "Time" magazine believed that this story best represents both sides of Roosevelt's personality.</p>
<p>This statement from "Time" magazine is actually wrong. Using Roosevelt's great achievements to explain this story is understandable, but using this story to explain Roosevelt's great achievements is pure nonsense. Just like fortune tellers who travel around, "knowing the past" is often quite accurate to about sixty percent, but "knowing the future" is completely absurd. After serving four terms as president, it is easy to find some beautiful stories from his childhood, but to "see the big in the small," to use this example to understand that, is missing the mark by a mile.</p>
<p>"Seeing a world from one person," the world will never be seen clearly. Seeing a person from the world, then the characters are all within it. Therefore, Molotov sneezing has nothing to do with the future of the United Nations meeting, and Marshall casually saying something unfavorable to A does not necessarily benefit B. The overall situation should be viewed from a broad perspective, and it cannot be judged by trivial details.</p>
<p>The "human interest" in the news reporter's pen is just a technique to attract readers, and it is not worthy of emulation.</p>
<h3>A Record of Falling Phoenix Slope</h3>
<p>— Long Xiang</p>
<p>On March 10th, the Free Talk section carried Mr. Wang Baili's article "Falling Phoenix Slope." This reminded me of a previous visit to that place, so I will cautiously describe what I remember. (At the time, I was young and had no subjective or in-depth opinions or research, merely recording what I saw and heard. Errors are inevitable.) I will briefly describe it below, hoping to add to Mr. Wang's article and requesting correction!</p>
<p>In the autumn of the twenty-ninth year [of the Republic], I was a guest in Guanghan County, Sichuan. (Guanghan is the former Zhui County from the Three Kingdoms period, located ninety li north of Chengdu on the vital Sichuan-Shaanxi highway.) I had long heard of the famous historical sites along the Sichuan-Shaanxi road, such as the Golden Goose Bridge near Guanghan, Falling Phoenix Slope between Deyang and Luojiang, the cypress tree planted by Zhang Fei in Zitong, and the Jianmen Pass in Jiange. I secretly admired them. One day, I had a ride to Luojiang, so I took the opportunity to visit Falling Phoenix Slope first. It was late autumn, and the mountains were mostly bare, with red leaves everywhere. The branches and leaves were sparse, and the setting sun added to the desolate scene. Before reaching Falling Phoenix Slope, the road turned northwest. We abandoned the car and walked, finding a small path between the mountains. We climbed the steps, the path being rugged and winding, truly a strategic location. Halfway up the slope was a stone fortress named Baima (White Horse), likely White Horse Pass. Looking up at the mountaintop, clusters of verdant pine trees added interest to the autumn scenery. The Pang Gong Shrine, nestled among the pines, with its eaves visible, filled me with excitement.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the temple, the architecture was not particularly grand. Two or three families lived on either side, each with a thatched shed for incense and candles in front of their doors, adding to the desolate atmosphere. Several Taoists, hearing of our arrival, diligently greeted us. Entering the hall, the shrine of the Phoenix Chick (Pang Tong) was there, with a dark face and many whiskers, not resembling a refined scholar. The two corridors were lined with statues of generals who entered Sichuan with him, but they were half-ruined! I was inspired and briefly strolled around before taking my leave.</p>
<p>Behind the temple was a stone path leading to Luojiang. The mountain slope was gentler, and a stone tablet stood beside the path, with the three characters "Falling Phoenix Slope" written in official script. It seemed to be newly erected by later generations, and weeds were already engulfing it! Crows were calling out as dusk approached, and withered grass faced the setting sun. I could not help but feel a sense of desolation as I paid my respects to this hero of an era!</p>
<p>As far as I know, Falling Phoenix Slope does indeed have its site and belongs to Luojiang County. The Complete Library in Four Sections, Shu Zhong Guang Ji Mingsheng Ninth (North Sichuan Road) also records: "The Universal Geography records that Luojiang County was originally Fudi of Guanghan. The Jin Dynasty moved to Chanting due to Li Xiong's rebellion. The current city is it. Ten li southwest is White Horse Pass, facing Deer Head Pass. The record says that the mountaintop is flat with a small path for vehicles. During the Three Kingdoms period, it was a military camp. Among them is named Falling Phoenix Slope. According to legend, Mr. Phoenix, Pang Shiyuan, served Zhao Lie and died here under stray arrows. (Note 1 omitted)" Also, the Jiaqing Revised Unified Records states: "Pang Gong Shrine is located ten li south of Luojiang County at White Horse Pass, where Pang Tong is enshrined." I wonder if this is where Mr. Wang was referring to? I have added the above for experts to correct. [Note: According to the Biography of Pang Tong in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Shu Zhi: "Advancing to Huikou County, Tong led the troops to attack the city and was struck by stray arrows." It seems that Tong died in Wei (i.e., Guanghan). I don't know which is correct? I believe that Tong died at Falling Phoenix Slope is more credible. Since he died in Wei, he would not have been buried far away at Falling Phoenix Slope. I venture to say this to seek correction from wise men.]</p>

<h3>Inspiration from a Tie</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>I recently bought a tie, entirely by chance. A few days ago, I was passing by the Cathay Theater on Linsen Middle Road for some business. A long row of ties displayed in the window of a department store, with unique styles and vibrant colors, caught my eye. At the time, I seemed to think it was too expensive, so I only glanced at it and had no intention of buying it. After returning, I forgot about it.</p>
<p>These past two days, I received a稿酬 from a magazine, and since I had no other immediate use for it, I visited that department store again. Coincidentally, the store was holding a 10% discount sale on silk ties. I painstakingly chose one from a pile of colorful ties. After asking the clerk to waive the last 25,000 yuan, I happily bought it and took it home.</p>
<p>At the time, why I chose that particular tie was largely due to my intuition and subconscious. When I got home, opened the package, and looked closely, I felt that the tie's design, color scheme, cut, and material were truly pleasing. Its pattern included small squares, circles, narrow stripes, and triangles, arranged in a harmonious manner, not a chaotic mess. Its colors were red, yellow, white, and blue, and it was dotted with many silver flecks. The inside of the tie was lined with wool and white silk. If I may put it abstractly, it seemed to symbolize the kaleidoscope-like life of its maker's country.</p>
<p>I suddenly gained some inspiration from this tie. Why didn't I choose another plain tie that was displayed next to it and priced one-third cheaper? I think there is a reason. Most people like complexity and dislike simplicity. They dislike the ordinary and love the extraordinary. This tie's difference from the ties on the market touched my heart.</p>
<p>I was reminded of something that the American writer John Dos Passos mentioned in one of his short essays: that mankind's lowest desires must be free from the fear of cold and hunger. However, due to mankind's love of complexity, after having enough to eat and wear, they still hope to eat well and dress stylishly.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the things that people like extend in many directions, like a large octopus, capturing the things it welcomes. Generally, people are not satisfied with sensory pleasures, as well as achievements in science, art, and culture. They have love, ambition, a sense of justice, and compassion... but they also have greed, arrogance, brutality, jealousy, and coldness. There are many among us who love to go to the cinema to watch crime movies or abnormal psychology films, watching the protagonist's cruel acts to fill the void that they cannot experience in real life. If we truly feared "evil" as we fear "epidemics," "ghosts," "darkness," "poverty," "hunger," or "atomic bombs," then we would only flee from it, and who would dare to appreciate it?</p>
<p>Therefore, I suddenly realized that world peace is not an unattainable castle in the air. If everyone in the world hopes for peace, peace can be achieved immediately. To this day, the world situation is still turbulent and unstable, and the gunpowder atmosphere on the world political stage seems to be getting stronger and stronger. Why is this? Perhaps it is because some people say they want peace with their mouths, but in their hearts, they find joy in war and killing. As far as these people are concerned, when they are tired of war and bitterly regret their past mistakes, eternal and true peace will still come to the world. It would naturally be better for them to wake up sooner, before things become irreparable.</p>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<p>— He Yun</p>
<p>When Chinese people meet, they often like to ask, "What have you been doing for entertainment lately?" The answers are mostly: "Watching movies, playing cards..." or even "Very bored," "Nothing to do." In fact, there are materials worth studying everywhere in the world, but we just don't pay attention.</p>
<p>"Observation" is the most interesting work. The people in the world are of all kinds, and if we can do a reasonable analysis of them, the fun is endless. But "observation" is definitely not using despicable means to pry into other people's secrets. The condition of observation is calmness. Observing others and analyzing their character, its purpose is also to better understand oneself. The greatest pain of mankind is not understanding oneself. This is because people often judge themselves with their own consciousness and cannot look at themselves from the position of a third party. Observing others is easier to do objectively. Understanding others more easily also makes it easier to recognize oneself a little more. Therefore, observation is definitely not comparable to "prying into the secrets of others."</p>
<p>What we usually feel most inconvenient about when studying knowledge or theory is that they are too abstract or too rigid. But studying people's character is not only a practical but also an active work, which is the most interesting. From a person's face, speech, and behavior... we can determine his thoughts, wisdom, knowledge, likes, and dislikes... We can know whether he is active or quiet, rational or emotional, strong or cowardly. Although this cannot be trained in a day or two, over time, we will unlock many subtle mysteries of character, and our minds will also become as organized as a geometrician.</p>
<h3>Tricycle Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Since moving to Hongkou, it has been eight or nine months. I always hire a tricycle to the office every day, and it has become a habit. Today, I suddenly remembered that the fare to the office when I first moved here seemed to be less than 5,000 yuan, but now it is already no less than 30,000 yuan. Exactly when did it rise from 5,000 to 10,000, and when did it rise from 10,000 to 20,000 to 30,000? I simply can't say. In the past, when I paid 5,000 yuan, I never felt it was cheap. Now, when I pay 30,000 yuan, I don't feel it's too expensive either. In all fairness, the "automatic adjustment" of the fare is natural. From the point of view that the adjustment is completely seamless, I feel that the adjustment is very reasonable.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of the bargaining when hiring a car, which is actually quite interesting. For example, when the driver asks for 40,000 yuan, he may have the thought in his mind that "30,000 yuan is also okay." So when I counteroffer and say "25,000," he will sometimes laugh and say, "Okay, 30,000." So the transaction is successful, and both he and I are satisfied. On the other hand, if I insist on only offering 20,000 yuan, and it is raining, and the ground is muddy and difficult to walk on, he will definitely not agree, and I will have to bury my head and rush on the road in the rain. Not to mention that my leather shoes are splashed with mud, my briefcase will also be wet as if it was fished out of the water. In a moment of anxiety, I still have to hire a car, and the result is often that the fare is still 30,000 yuan, and I have only walked a long distance in vain.</p>
<p>Therefore, "bargaining" is completely a matter of "estimation." His haggling is an estimation of his own labor, and in my case, I estimate whether this value is reasonable. I haggle because I want to "live"; I can't haggle too low, because I should also "let others live."</p>
<p>The competition in the biological world is so fierce that "living" and "letting others live" seem to be in conflict. It is quite difficult to find that delicate balance between these conflicts, and "estimation" becomes a very difficult art. If the Japanese had estimated more accurately, they might not have tasted the flavor of the atomic bomb; if Hitler had estimated more accurately, perhaps his position today would still be above Franco and Perón.</p>
<p>Therefore, if everyone is good at haggling for tricycle fares, it must be beneficial to the peace of the world. My son is only three years old now, and when he learns to read and write in the future, I will definitely teach him the way of hiring tricycles first. My "family instruction" is actually very simple: if you don't ride a tricycle, that's fine. If you want to ride, you can't haggle too low. Otherwise, even if you are stuck in the mud and sigh, others will inevitably criticize you with only the words "serves you right."</p>

<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 13 Striving to Remedy (105)</p>
<p>It turned out that Qihuan had returned alone this time, because after arriving in Hong Kong with Daoyun, they stayed in a hotel. In the first few days, she took him to visit two photography factories, which Daoyun claimed he had shares in. After visiting these two factories, Daoyun went out every day and didn't return until late at night. When he returned, he was either drunk or covered in opium smoke. When asked where he had gone, he always gave vague excuses, claiming to be dealing with company business or socializing with friends. Later, seeing him like this every day, she occasionally asked to go out with him, but he always made excuses. After inquiring, she learned that he spent every day in gambling dens. Hong Kong's gambling dens were notorious for ruining people, so how could she let him do this? Whenever she tried to persuade him, he always said that he had to socialize outside. To do a big business, he had to rely on socializing. If he wasn't active in the social scene, he would lose all kinds of opportunities. He had also come to Hong Kong to do some speculative trading. As long as this trade was successful, all problems would be solved. The so-called speculative trading was just a hope to get lucky in the gambling dens. Seeing what he was doing, it was all empty talk. He didn't mention a word about the film business, training basic staff, or hiring stars, as if all the words he had said in Beijing and Shanghai had been completely forgotten once he arrived in Hong Kong. Seeing this situation, how could she not be anxious? She repeatedly mocked and questioned him, but he just said with a smile, "In Hong Kong, what the rich pay attention to is speculative trading. As long as luck arrives, everything can be solved." One night he came back and sighed in the room. Qihuan ignored him. Later, he muttered to himself, "I'm really unlucky today." She said, "You're originally unlucky! You don't do anything good all day, just mess around in gambling dens. How can you not be unlucky?" He said, "It's originally nothing. Losing a million Hong Kong dollars isn't anything, but this money was for a deposit. If I lost it, and the order is delayed, it will be much more expensive! I could borrow from friends, but I don't want to ask. Last time I saw you had a box of jewelry. Can you lend it to me to pawn it first? I'll return it to you tomorrow afternoon. Is that okay?" Qihuan said it was okay, but it was already past three o'clock today. Nothing can be rushed in one day. Wait until tomorrow! He said, "It's still possible now." Qihuan ignored him, and he didn't dare to ask again. That night, Qihuan thought all night that Daoyun's actions were simply trying to trick her out of her things! If she continued to associate with him, all the savings she had would be tricked out of her. Seeing this situation, she had to leave him immediately.</p>
<h3>Antiquarianism and Dogmatic Conservatism</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>In terms of time, the past and the present are relative terms. The past is ancient, and the present is now. This is common knowledge that everyone knows, so naturally there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>It is said that Qin Shi Huang burned books and buried scholars, and his motivation was related to the scholars' "fondness of the past and disdain for the present." This may not be a fabrication. Because after Qin Shi Huang completed his unification of the world, he began to abolish the feudal system and establish prefectures and counties, making unprecedented reforms in politics. As a result, intellectuals with minds full of old culture and restoration ideas naturally held dissatisfaction. Thus, the so-called "differing in their hearts when inside, and discussing it in the streets when outside" may not have been out of character. As a result, it exceeded the scope of what the autocratic monarch of the generation could tolerate, thinking that they were deliberately causing trouble, opening their mouths to Yao and Shun, and closing their mouths to Wen and Wu, "using the past to criticize the present, confusing the common people." As a result, he staged the tragedy of burning books and burying scholars, "unprecedented and unparalleled," even to the point of "those who accidentally spoke of poetry and books being abandoned in the marketplace!"</p>
<p>Mankind does indeed have this inferiority. When he is dissatisfied with reality, he often expresses his "ancient sentiments," naturally falling into the trap of "fondness of the past and disdain for the present." Some who are more stubborn become die-hard restorationists, gnawing on dead bones, bringing out useless things like "ancestral precepts" and "ancient systems" to overwhelm people. Wang Anshi, a great politician of the Song Dynasty, in order to implement his determination to implement the New Policies, once solemnly said to Emperor Shenzong during an audience: "Heavenly changes are not to be feared, ancestors are not to be followed, and people's words are not to be feared." What courageous and bold words these were! But the phrase "ancestors are not to be followed" became the focus of the conservatives' personal attacks on him, even bestowing upon him the nickname "Stubborn Chancellor." From this, one can also know how deeply rooted "the past" is in the hearts of conservatives.</p>
<p>After the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shih and others advocated the vernacular movement and also encountered the siege of many defenders of classical Chinese. Although vernacular Chinese now has its solid foundation, there are still many ancients who defend the past. I remember that a year or two ago, someone was still calling for the re-promotion of vernacular Chinese. We can easily know that a new reform will inevitably encounter challenges from all sides. The road ahead is truly long and difficult! Naturally, not all "ancient" things are completely bad, but all "ancient" things that do not meet the needs of the times and are out of touch with the times are undoubtedly to be discarded. What's more, clinging to the ancient without change is, after all, hindering the progress of the times and is a very dangerous thing!</p>
