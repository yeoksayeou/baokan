<h3 id="c24">長江水患與水利建設 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>今年四月以來，長江上游水位，突趨上漲，打破歷年記錄。往年長江沿岸的防汛工作，以六月十五日開始期，今年破　提早於五月十五日。漢口水位，五月十五日爲「二二·八二一，超過了民國二十年同期之水位；到七月十八日，水位續升至「二六·三六」，比二十年大水災時同期水位　低一公尺九二。漢口爲長江上游的源頭，百水匯集，故漢口水位的起伏，成爲了長江水流高下的指樑。現在，川鄂湘贛皖各省暴雨成災，湖濱水流有泛濫之勢。重慶和三峽水位，日有暴漲，上下輪船都停泊宜昌，未敢冒險西上。湖南洞庭湖十餘縣，潰倒堤垸爲數益衆，昔日糧倉已成水庫，沿湖人民陷于水沼中，來日生死難卜。這樣險惡的現象，若不及早搶救，則沿長江數省農田所受的危害，和萬千人民安居所受的浸襲，將不知伊於胡底。</p>
<p>長江亦稱揚子江，它是川·鄂·湘·豫·皖·蘇等省萬流百水所集的一支主流，拔自高原，奔向大海；它在地勢上和經濟地理上，爲沿江兩岸人民的生存繁榮所繁。長江之水，雖是萬裏滔滔，但它的源流和歸趨，清澄和順，非黄河濁流所可與之比擬。長江之水很少破堤成災，戕害人民，所以歷代史家詩人，禮贊長江之水，乃清流而非禍水。民國二十年一次大水災，　成武漢三鎮空前大浩劫，這是長江史上不幸的一頁。可是廿年水患的原因，與其說是自然因素，毋寧說是人謀不臧。由於廿年水災的空前教訓，國民政府積極　求水利，注意築堤防汛，各省地方政府也開始小型水利的設施，疏濬水源河流，十餘年來收穫了很大的效果。抗戰八年，沿江各省多陷敵手，在日寇「有破壞無建設」的情勢下，致首日一些消極性的築堤防汛工作，也荒廢不治，所以勝利復員後三年，沿江河流湖濱，時有水患發生。今年長江水位上升，湘贛各省已現災象，其原因有二：（一）由於去冬桃汛水位陡高，今年四月以後時有豪雨，致沿江水位驟高；（二）長江上游伏汛提早一個月，純係自然的因素。至於洞庭湖濱的大泛濫，是由於八年抗戰，堤垸溝渠久麼失修，現在不幸遭受自然的迫害，致横流冲掃大地，釀成了今日的　災。</p>
<p>明瞭了長江的重要和水災　成的原因，我們應該講求水利行政的途徑和方法。近代國家對於河政之治理，其途徑不外有三：（一）疏導江河，避免水災；（二）整理航道，便利交通；（三）開發水利，促進工業。美國TVA計劃，它能將一條時常泛濫破壞廬舍土壤的「美國黄河」，變成造福人民的恩物，世界各國莫不震於它工程偉大和它的功用。美國TVA計劃的成功，是水利行政的措施中最高度的一種效能表現；它在消極方面，避免水災，便利航運，更在積極方面，發揮動力，促進工業。這種具有遠大建設意義的措施，不僅資本主義國家需要，抑且爲農業國家走向工業化途徑所迫切需要。我國政府於抗戰勝利後，原想將TVA計劃實施於長江和錢塘江，並得美國工程人員的支持，設計了三峽水庫的計劃，可惜這件偉大的工程，中途擱置，何等令人惋惜，三峽水庫建設計劃，與塘沽築港黄埔築港，同樣具有重要性，如楹防止水災的意義說，三峽水庫的建設，其造福長江各省人民，比塘沽黄埔築港工程，更有偉大的意義。現在，長江沿河發生水患，險象横生，從治理河政的積極意義上說，我們主張三峽水庫工程的恢復，這是根本消滅水患，發揮工業動力建設長江上游的一種措施。從治理河政的消極意義上說，水利當局和地方政府，工程人員和沿江人民，應該學習黄河花園口堵口合龍的精神，發揮智　，運用人力，迅速搶險堵口，破除災害。</p>
<p>目前長江的水患，患在上游和湘漢兩水，情勢之嚴重，有如去年黄河花園口合龍之前夕，若不幸而釀成巨災，則禍亂必有甚於廿年之武漢水災，這是我們要首先警惕的。現在，沿江各省防汛工作已開始，惟搶救工作做得不够，民力動員亦不够，致沿江居民發生過度的惶恐。要之，搶險堵口是一件迫切的緊急動作，不可存蓄優劣絕續「聽天由命」的心理，政府和人民，工程與計劃，必須要具有旋乾轉坤的精神，纔能够人力勝天，克服自然。我們關切長江目前的水患，因而我們呼籲沿江各省地方政府，迅速發動民力，以黄河合龍的勇毅精神，積極開始搶險防汛的工作，破除長江早汛可能發生的巨災，以慶安瀾。</p>
<p>總之，長江之水明如鏡，淸如澄，它不是禍亂的源泉，它不是戕害人民的毒蛇猛獸；它的一片汪洋，萬里滔滔，必有其淸澄和順的歸途，衹要以人力有效的導引，不要讓它自然變化，決之東方則東流，決之西方則西流，則長江之水，造福人羣，便利交通，將是人間世一條平坦的大道。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕中共中央委員會七月十日關於南斯拉夫共產黨問題的決議，經新華社廣播，本社曾摘要發表，茲將全文錄誌如次：</p>
<p>（一）中國共產黨中央委員會完全同意由保，羅，匃，波，蘇，法，捷，義各國共產黨所參加的情報局會議，關於南斯拉夫共產黨問題所通過的決議，舉行這個會議，並通過這個決議，乃是國際共產主義者爲保衛馬克思—列寗主義的原則，保衛世界工人階級和各國人民的革命事業所應盡的職責，乃是他們爲保衛世界和平民主事業，保衛南斯拉夫人民免受美帝國主義的愚弄和侵略所應盡的職責。，二</p>
<p>（二）以「鐵托」·「卡德爾」·「德熟拉斯」，「蘭科維奇」爲代表的南斯拉夫共產黨的領導集團，在其對內，對外的背叛性的和錯誤的行動中，違反了馬克思—列寗主義的基本觀點，例如社會主義國家與資本主義國家的原則區別，國際援助對於各國革命運動的必要性和重要性，階級鬥爭和資產階級對於人民革命事業的領導作用，黨是階級的最高組織形式，黨的民主集中及黨內批評和自我批評的作用等，從而陷入資產階級，民族主義和資產階級政黨的泥坑，鐵托集團因爲它執行反馬克斯—列寗主義的內外政策，因爲它採取了反蘇立塲，壓制黨內批評，拒絕蘇聯共產黨其他五共產黨的兄弟批評，拒絕參加情報局會議，並在情報局會議的決議公佈以後，繼續壓制南斯拉夫黨內外的正確意見，繼續敵視國際共產主義，已經嚴重地損害了南斯拉夫的人民事業，並使南斯拉夫的敵人歡呼，中國共產黨熱烈希望南斯拉夫共產黨內的國際主義份子，能够堅決地起來科正鐵托集團的錯誤，使南斯拉夫共產黨從新走上馬克思—列寗主義的軌道，走上無產階級國際主義的軌道。</p>
<p>（三）中國共產黨中央委員會認爲南斯拉夫黨內所發生的事件，不是偶然的和孤立的現衆，這是階級鬭爭在無產階級革命隊伍中的反映，只要是階級存在的國家，帶着資產階級反革命觀點的投機份子，總是企圖混入無產階級的革命隊伍，混入共產黨企圖利用機會，從內部來破壞革命事業，這種情况，曾經在國際共產主義運動中多次發生，在中國共產黨黨內，則曾經表現爲陳獨秀主義和張國際主義，這種情况，要求共產黨人努力提高覺悟，加强馬克思——列寗主義理論的敎育，以便及時地識別和反對這些資產階級份子，保衛無產階級和人民的事業不欲破壞和損失，保衛共產黨在思想上和政治上的純潔。</p>
<p>爲此目的，中國共產黨中央委員會決定，全黨幹部都應當認眞研究共產黨情報局會議關於南斯拉夫共產黨問題的決議，藉以加强黨內關於階級的，黨的，國際主義的自我批評精神和紀律性的敎育。</p>
<h3 id="c51">援華工作欲獲成功　有賴中國人民自助　賴普漢昨晚在京廣播演說 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕美經濟合作總署中國分署署長賴普漢，於七月廿二日晚七時一刻，在南京美國軍事顧問團電台廣播「經濟合作總署在華之使命」，賴氏首稱其演說，主要係對寓華美僑發表者。</p>
<p>賴氏認中國今日之情形無疑較任何其他受美援國家爲艱難而不同。賴氏云：「目前吾人提議以七千萬元作爲採購中國人民切需之糧食，以七千萬元採購原棉，俾以製成之紗布出售所得價款，購買其他製成品，或以之易取其他貨品。吾人又提議以五千萬元採購石油製成品——以動力供給紗廠及需要動力之實業——以汽油供給中國之公共汽車，運貨車，及商用飛機，並其他依賴石油製成品之主要公用事業。吾人提議以一千三百萬元採購肥料，俾增加糧食之生產。吾人提議贈予或貸予中國七千萬元，以採辦配件——以恢復機器設備——或以建築工廠，擴充生產，及協助中國從事於運輸事業之改進。美援華分署尙有另一職務，即資助將由中美製雙方同意設立之鄕邨建設委員會。此會之目的，在對於農邨作長期性之援助——協助農夫發展較優之耕種方法，並促進較高之生活程度。吾人所有資金之一部份，將撥充該委員會之經費，其確數尙未定奪。」</p>
<p>「援華分署現正與中國政府商討，究應採取何種政策在中國市上出售吾人供給之糧食·棉花·肥料及石油產品。分署同人深信此等物品之大部份，應以吾人所稱之現實的價格出售——即足以反映在中國起岸時成本之價格。出售貨品所得中國貨幣之價款，將另行保存，其用途由中國政府與經濟合作署會商決定之。收入部份之若干中國貨幣，將用以資助吾人在華執行援助計劃之費用，一</p>
<p>賴氏複稱：一余在此六星期之時間使余　然於本分署所面對之困難——余深知吾人將因分署採取之甚多政策，而受責備。此項責備，或是或非；惟吾人之責任，固無可規避者，吾人所能爲力者，乃在時時善用吾人之最優判斷力，以應付任何環境。顧此外尙有另一責任，而此乃中國人民所應知者，卽除非中國人民決心全力自助，則本計劃或任何其他計劃均不能在援華工作上得以成功。自助須利用於每一可能之途徑。如吾人欲使本計劃眞正永遠有助於中國人民，則全力合作，實屬必要。如謂中國希望吾國會明年通過增加美援，則中國須自動從事於視目前更多之自助工作，此說實屬不誣。中國現有通貨膨脹問題—此言尙係輕微—但余之印象爲由於中國民衆所付賴外匯得來之物品與服務之代價過低，中國政府未能徵收應得之稅款。茲有一經多方徵實之　見，即中國之農夫實際上在津貼大都市；而火都市中有不少人民，尙可視今多納捐稅，以供國家之開支。例如以相等美金一二元之代價可由上海飛至南京，則作空中旅行者，於利用大部營業費用賴外匯維特之空中運輸事業時，可付並應付遠過於此之代價。在美國作如此距離之旅行，至少須付五倍之代價。對於游覽旅行耗費之汽油，加以限制，似屬不無理由。汽油以外匯得來，爲何不規定一現實的價格；而游覽性之旅行，爲何不按照歐洲各國之辦法，加以限制？此外，尙有甚多舉措，可彌補中國預算之不足，何不採取一强有力之自助計劃以研求此等舉措而執行之？」</p>
<p>賴氏並調：中國人民係一偉大之民族，有數十世紀文化之背景，具有刻苦耐勞之精神。中國人民與美國人民有甚多相同之點，吾等均愛好個人自由，均喜日常生活中有輕鬆之調劑，均不願受人控制。惟中美人民均須切記吾人今日乃生活於瞬息千變之時期中，在目前動盪之世界上爭取保陣，吾人決不能袖手不動。</p>
<p>賴氏於結束演詞前將重複强調：如美國將繼續馬歇爾計劃以助中國及其他國家，雙方必須有互助之願志。此種願志，須互相表現，而不是單方面的。賴氏云：「余知當余言美國願意繼續援助中國時，余實代表余之長官經濟合作總署執行人霍夫曼發言；但倘使吾人將進行繼續援華，則霍夫受君與余本人須能在今冬向國會—惟一能核准繼續援助之機構—保證中國之人民，中國之中央以及省市政府，均正盡力充分利用美國納稅人之金錢」</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿已開始與甫自德國返美之美軍政府長官克　將軍舉行柏林危機之重要會談。華盛頓官員鑒於各方對此一會談，均極矚目，因此特於事先籲請美國及外國記者對於柏林局勢勿故作驚人報道。在倫敦，艾德禮首相亦召集內閣，在唐寗街十號舉行會議，檢討國際局勢及柏林危機。由貝文外相報吿海牙西歐聯盟咨詢委會開會經過，及三强再答蘇聯照會草案之內容。英帝國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥於內閣開會前抵相邸，亦參與會議。西方三强致蘇新照會今祗待法國新內閣成立對照會內容同意後即可提出。外部發言人承認在週末以前，恐不及遞出。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿二日電〕法國新總理馬利組閣工作，因社會黨與其激進社會然之基本政治立塲不同而吿受阻。馬利與社會黨，人民共和黨及獨立共和黨諸領袖不絕會談，人民共和黨領袖於會後稱，財政計劃上並未獲致協議。社會黨要員莫萊賴瑪迪及羅雪均謁晤馬利，莫萊稱，「所談者問題多於人選」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿二電〕激進社會黨領袖馬利膺組閣命後，廿二日舉行一連串之會　，商討新政府陣容。法政界元老勃發姆將代皮杜爾出任外長。馬利亦思擯國防部長戴根出內閣。</p>
<p>按皮杜爾自簽訂倫敦六國協定以還，幾爲全部政界所不滿，尤其是皮氏所屬之人民共和黨爲最不滿。許曼倒閣時，激進社會黨正對戴根大施抨擊，馬利心目中之外長人選，尙有戰時總理萊諾，兩人廿一日晚已一度晤談。馬利稱，渠如決定接受歐禮和總統之組閣令，則將要求國民議會於廿三日開會通過其任命。馬利圖組廣泛之舉國聯合政府，容納各黨各派，然共產黨除外。然共黨之一百八十三票旣將反對馬利，故如再有反對票一百六十票，馬利內閣即將夭折。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿一日電〕毆禮和總統今日請右派激進社會黨員馬利試組新閣。馬氏現年五十歲一，身體甚　，戰時幾乎死在納粹集中營。渠而臨之大問題，在於拉攏許曼內閣之社會黨態度。該黨堅持政府管制經濟，激進社會黨則主張極大之私人經濟自由。社會黨今夜決定是否參加新內閣，須視馬利之經濟政策而定。同時，馬利則向激進社會黨聲明將繼續奉行財長梅逸★財政經濟主張，兩者如何調和，一時尙不易言。</p>

<p>— 蔡金聲譯</p>
<p>蘇聯能否發動世界戰爭？這是今日我們所面對着的第一個問題。蘇聯的戰爭計劃必須建築在它的工業經濟上，像美國國內的憤形一樣。關於蘇聯經濟　情報雖然不很充足，但有許多基本的事實是不可避免的。我們先從蘇聯的人口及其計劃說起。一般人認爲蘇聯的廣大領土，擁有極多的財富及能力，這是錯誤。</p>
<p>聯的版圖比德國大四十五倍，但它的領土有一大半是森林地區，差不多五分之一是沙漠或半沙漠地帶，只有八分之一的地區是肥沃的。蘇聯的人口有一億儿千二百萬人，其農業地區與美國差不多大小，而美國只有一億四千二百萬人。因此，蘇聯的糧食生產便無法滿足增加　的人口的需要。事實上，蘇聯將　續是世界的一個飢荒國度。</p>
<p>蘇聯有五千萬人流離失所，以致喪失於廣大的森林地帶及北部的苔原地帶。因此，蘇聯的人口生產，祗有美國那麽多。</p>
<p>大多數的蘇聯工廠係集中於西從列寗格勒及烏克蘭，東至西伯利亞新工業地區的三角形地帶。這是蘇聯全部領土的一小部份，但却是經濟發展的主要來源。這三角形地帶是很不安全的。</p>
<p>目前蘇聯的工業生產，還沒有達到四十八年前炎國那樣的程度。</p>
<p>我們知道德國·義大利·日本及英國遭受了戰爭的損害，但蘇聯却是損害最利害的國家。蘇聯損失了鐵路車輛百分之五十八，鋼百分之四十五，電力百分之四十四，煤產百分之五十五。又損失了四分之一的牲畜，幾百萬間房屋，建築物及橋樑。</p>
<p>在戰爭結束時，蘇聯的經濟潛力比較美國的能力，從百分之四十二降落至百分之二十五。假如蘇聯重建工作順利進行，——事實上却不順利——那末它在一九五一年，可以擁有一九〇四年（四十四年前）美國一樣的工業生產力。到一九六〇年，它的生產額可以達到一九三八年美國的程度。</p>
<p>一九四六年二月九日，史　林宣佈第四　五年計劃時，他說：「基本的任務包括了工業上及農業上恢復戰前的永準，然後或多或少地超過這偶水準。……要達成這一任務，也許需要三個新的五年計劃。但我們必須這樣做」。假如我們仔細地研究這基本的步驟，分析史達林的目標，大體上是明顯的，但蘇聯永遠不會完成一個五年計劃。</p>
<p>史達林宣佈：這目標要在一九五一年生產石油六千萬噸，而在廿八年前，自由的美國人已經達到了這目標。在一九四七年，美國生產了二億七千　噸。蘇聯的石油供應非常貧乏，所以它隨時盡可能的改用煤及其他燃料。</p>
<p>瑞典的燃料工程師發現，蘇聯煤產的百分之卅係用於汽車，另外百分之卅用於電力生產。所以，只留下百分之四十，用於蘇聯燃煤的工業，包括鋼鐵用的石炭。史達林希望他的五年計劃在一九五一年生產煤五億噸，而在卅年前，美國已有這個數量了。　史達林要求新五年計劃（或下次）的末期出產鋼六千萬噸。美國在第二次大戰結束以前，早已生產了差不多百分之五十。蘇聯缺乏發動戰爭的幾種重要戰　原料—　·錫·銻。尤其是橡皮。它在海外沒有安全的運輸綫來獲得橡皮，它又不能建立完整的工廠來生產粽合皮。</p>
<p>不過，蘇聯最顯著的點是運輸。表面上，它的輪船並不過份落後。在戰前，它的商船有一百萬噸——等於瑞典的噸數——差不多是美國的租界　與及戰前德·義·芬蘭賠償的商輪的二倍。而且，日本輪船預定替聯建造一百七十五艘，以交換煤及焦炭。</p>
<p>但是，蘇聯的領域，對於它的有限制的國內運輸，有驚人的需要。公路少而又破碎。唯一的重要公路是從　斯　北至列寗格勒，西至明斯克，南至基輔及卡爾科夫之綫。在各大城市，主要地是應用卡車。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自前次颱風吹經長江下游後，半月來不斷陰雨，因之潮汎高漲，沿江一帶由寳山至太倉常熟縣境之海塘堤岸會數度吿急，其中尤以太倉縣境九十里江堤，因年久失修，樁石不堪冲刷，道堂廟附近（在太倉東北）日前即一度爲江潮侵入，堤岸幾全告傾圯，幸該縣縣長薛佩琦，建設科長張漢淸星夜督同居民及當地駐軍搶堵，得未決口。江南海塘工程處上海辦事處聞訊，廿日特派科長曹司量赴太倉實地視察，蘇滬海塘工程救濟專家委員會亦派督導工程師關富權，秘書鍾槐靑，專員侯硯圃等前往踏勘，經會同薛縣長査明，太倉境內急待施工搶救之塘岸共有八處：（一）閱兵台，碉堡南樁石損壞。（二）道堂廟，樁石工程損毁二二〇公尺。（三）新塘口北一·五公里處之方家堰，塘身　薄。（四）閔家宅，海塘損毀二六九公尺。（五）楊林口北約一公里處之茜涇河口（現已堵塞）外坡卅八公尺，冲刷殆盡。（六）七丫口北原有樁石工程六十五公尺被冲殆盡。（七）七丫口南海塘頂端坍毀，塘內田地已爲潮水淹沒。（八）錢涇口東岸一〇〇公尺，西岸卅五公尺，俱被冲毀。現各方以秋汎倐屆，且近日雨量正有增無减，爲謀積極防措，頃已決定八月一日正式成立工務所，按術方面由海塘工程處負責，土方及伕工由太倉縣政府籌劃，搶堵經費則由美援中撥用四百億。太倉縣府現已在瀏河附近營造施工　舍，並着手編組民工，此輩民工多係蘇北鹽阜一帶流亡之漁民，目前漁汎已過，渠等正可藉此施工機會解決生計問題。據薛縣長表示，太倉境內海塘經竭力搶堵後，如最近無狂風驟雨，或不致　嚴重後果，現因潮汎仍在高漲，故已飭沿江一帶密切注意，在未施工前，先由居民晝夜輪守，以防變化。渠本人定今日偕同張建設科長再度赴江岸視察督導。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日淸晨六時四十五分，從上海北站第六號月台駛出了一列負有歷史使命的火車——飛快車在穩捷行進了五小時後，準時準刻完成了京滬全程的第一次試車，不但恢復了戰前高度的行軍效率，並且由於臨時遭遇到的冷氣設備的損壞，反映了路局各部門人員含辛茹苦克服艱難的勇氣與精神。　P5型106機車在謝震副局長親自駕駛下，輕輕拖曳着九節流綫型車廂出站。那種稀有平穩的「起步」，幾乎有半數過份欣喜的搭客（其實是參加試車的記者羣與路局人員），未曾覺察到車站的往後移動。</p>
<p>列車的時速從廿四公里漸增到六十四公里，七八分鐘後已過了　翔。窗外雲層雖則好　便壓在車頂上面似的，窗內的人們興緻却異樣的高。中段的餐車裏有可以玩牌戯的方桌，最後一節瞭望車裏有　舒適的沙發，因此吸引了最大多數的靑年男女，彷彿兩個小型的俱樂部。忘記了隔宵睡眠不足的倦怠，甚至忘記了車廂內在逐漸增加中的溫度。</p>
<p>平均速度六十公里</p>
<p>餐車裏的空氣比瞭望車的緊張，除了三四桌牌戯之外，有一兩桌嚴肅地坐着路局運務處的工作人員，不斷在記錄着每一公里每一站的行車速度，把它跟預擬的計劃相對證。薛段長告訴我：這列車最快可達時速八十五公里，由於路軌與過站速度的限制，目前實際的平均速度是六十公里，過崑山時是全程最快的一段，時速達七十五公里。他說：戰前飛快車掛車廂六節，全程停蘇錫常鎭四站，四時五十分鐘到達南京。目前的P5型機車，中間只停兩站，可以毫無問題完成預定的五小時抵京的使命。</p>
<p>冷氣損壤　溫度激增</p>
<p>但是問題來了，甫過崑山，瞭望車內乘客開始向前段　廂移動，覺察到冷氣機壞了。隨車技工在紀錄着車廂內寒暑表上的紅綫：竟有八十三度，有的竟高至八十六度。工程師與冷氣匠忙碌地來去檢騐。　斷結果是三根輸電管中斷了一根，少數冷氣機沒有電力的發動，於是溫度便失去了應有的調節。隨車視察成績的機務處浦副處長等負責人同時認爲每節車廂內的飛爾可冷氣機的通氣管在裝置上可能也有問題。</p>
<p>飛快車不停地前進，負責員工無法到車廂底下去檢視或修理。八點零五分過蘇站，陽光破雲而出，車廂氣溫更增高了。有的竟達九十一度，較車外飄溫低得有限。</p>
<p>列車的行駛時刻却是正確得像時鐘一樣，八點四十一分到無錫，停六分鐘，九點廿三半過常州，十點廿九分半到鎭江，絕無絲毫之差。就祗經過蘇站正在修理中的一〇二號橋，慢了二分鐘，過蘇站分道又慢了一分鐘，但不到無錫也便趕上了時間。</p>
<p>如此，飛快車準時駛進了南京下關站，時間是十一點四十五分正，完成了路局預期的提高行車速度的任務。</p>
<p>正式通車　尚無確期</p>
<p>午後，當彭主任等招待着記者們上新靑口或玄武湖閒逛的時候，流綫型列車進機車房整理，謝副局長和浦副處長等還是不停地揮汗修理電綫及冷氣機。</p>
<p>五點五十分，列車載着我們東南行，駛回上海來。在餐車中，謝副局長應記者之請，談起了流綫型飛快車產生的動機是（一）路局極力想提高行車速度與密度；（二）想利用路局原有的材料作新的構造技術上的嘗試，以冀自力達到現代國際水準。絕不是想替什麽豪富之流設法奢華的享受。</p>
<p>當此兵荒馬亂之世而仍能有這種自力邁進的勇氣與精神，當然是無法厚非的。至於技術上的枝枝節節，只要有不斷硏究改進的毅力，古人說得好，失敗是成功之母。總之，飛快車的兩個主要目的之一「行車速度」絕對圓滿地獲得了。至於第二點，空氣調節問題，謝副局長說要改善。對廿五日正式通車與否，他毫無把握地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>言談間，飛快車已過鎭江，竟遇上了傾瀉一般的大雨。車廂裏還是那麽悶熱。車廂玻窗是密封的，無法打開，忍不住熱的人便站立在暢開的車門旁納凉。我幸運地在車門洞開並未裝行李的行李車中，找了個凉快的角落，假寐到上海。抵站時間絕對準點，剛正是晚上十一點五十分。這實在是他們唯一的安慰了。</p>

<p>〔本報江陰廿一日訊〕馬鎭鄕西暘橋百丈里人孫溥生，字贊育，係上海信泰橡膠廠股東，又任經理，於本月六日忽被該鄕鄕長鈕玉生逮捕，以通匪爲由，藉圖逃格斃。茲經記者下鄉調査，此案似另有內幕。</p>
<p>死者之父孫冠月於十日與妻王氏來城，呈訴縣府與法院伸　，據稱：其子溥生經營商業，時常返家，有族人孫耀威住後前巷村，其女名金玉，尚未宇人，因與溥生爲同族關係，感情甚好，鄉長　生，見金玉略具姿色欲施求愛，遂其私欲，金玉終未允諾，　見溥生與女甚密切，暗存醋意，于五月十一日向女父借白米二石未成，　遇薄生由滬回鄕，致書要求轉向金女借米五石，亦遭拒絕，因此蓄恨已久。在岡謀槍殺之前，先派人將左輪手槍私藏孫家，乘六日溥生返鄕時逮捕，先事非刑拷打，後假脫逃爲由，拖至北頭村旁殺害。其父在鄉恐遭陷害，特上城請有關主管呼籲，緝辦兇手，以伸寃抑。</p>
<p>頃據記者探悉：孫溥生曾任首都衛戍司令部無錫指揮所情報員，業經曹主任正員證明，幷非匪徒。其父孫冠月，已分呈指揮所及江陰縣府，幷向地方法院起訴。孫溥生抗戰時，由忠救軍參議鄭子良保送至皖省廣德受訓後，參加地下工作，與奸匪誓不兩立。勝利後，轉入上海立信會計學校肄業，又與友人在滬西合開信泰橡膠廠。在六日被害後，身畔　中尙有某剿匪機關五月廿七日致孫信件，商討探詢匪徒行蹤。</p>
<p>據悉：孫溥生被殺後由縣軍法科員邢自振相驗，曾驗有手足指甲間受毒刑重傷。行兇動手者，係自衛隊　興寳，死者連中五槍，計頭部三槍，脅部一槍，腿部一槍。如此連擊五槍，况　大路一條，並無支路等跡象觀之，似無圖逃之嫌。聞縣府方面已令璜塘區長吳宗淵澈査，法院方面尙須開棺相驗，硏究是否圖逃與故意槍殺原因，方能眞相大白。</p>

<p>〔本報蘇州廿二日電〕蘇州鮮肉商停屠罷市業已二日，迭經調解迄無結果，，罷市起因雖由於政府調整屠宰稅率過高，然平日肉商對軍肉之承辦，犧牲過鉅，成本日高，漲價醞釀已久。據情勢觀察，一時尙難解決。</p>

<h3 id="c106">石油城印象 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州廿日航訊〕在我所遊歷的許多城鎭中，最使我感到興奮的，是建築在老君廟的石油城。城的大門朝北，當你來到了檢査站（入口處）武裝警察詢問你入內任務時，你正面向着遙遠的南山，這座石油城就在這許多大山的懷抱中，稍轉向右方，可見到新的煉廠，建築在靠近石油河的四台，環境同位置極優美，附近並有儲油場，不過離生產中心稍遠。進確後，有一條長約一華里的。形馬路，左右為職員住宅區，中問建有苗圃，在老君廟須有超人的努力，才能使樹木生長，這裏可以說是老君廟的綠　。</p>
<p>在U形路的頂端是總辦公　與創有柏汕路的廣塲，對面爲可以容納五百人的大禮堂，建築費用雖大，但這裏離城中很遠，又無其他娛樂塲所，它是極需要的。</p>
<p>在U形路的左面路很平坦，旁爲陶器塲（即磚窰股），這裏燒製煉廠同溶欲　爐所用的火磗及家用的各種陶瓷器用具。現約有　子幾十頭，用來推磨，並從很遠的地方馱運工作上所需要的各種石頭。</p>
<p>禮堂的兩旁是職員宿舍同招待室（指祁連別墅）招待室的旁邊有許多磗窰，是用渣油作燃料燒製磗同石灰。</p>
<p>順寬　敞的馬路前進，右面的廐舍（馱運股），內有馬，騾，驢，駱駝同牛，左面有許多普通平房。再向左是學校同麵粉廠。</p>
<p>續南行，右首有食用等供　部份（即供　社），並可大量製造衣服，鞋子，醬油，豆腐，同各種點心；這種設備需要有組織及經費。再向前，右　是運　課，左面是醫院同機電廠。</p>
<p>走到二英哩長馬路的終點，可以看到許多騾馬車，滿載油水去供給礦內約五千員工們應用，（按現已增加到　千人）在現代仍用這種運　，似覺　費。　顧　油城整個被黑烟所　罩着，空氣汚　，因之兒童難以淸潔，爲節省同健康　見，這些缺點等到物質條件充裕時定可改善。（現　部多已改用天然氣（Gas）做燃料，水管正敷設）</p>
<p>到終點右面，可以俯觀石油河在三百英尺山崖下，蜿蜒流向沙漠平原，它與大馬路成平形狀。到此後所見到的各種事物，更能增加我們對老君廟的深刻印象，並由於這種横切面，可很淸楚的見到地層的構造，使地質學家益形興奮。</p>
<p>沿灣路向下走，不久到了具有歷史意義的紅色小廟——老君廟，現在香火仍旺，附近可以見到舊井的遺跡，已封閉的第五井，從氣壓同浸油的情形觀察，每天仍可出油幾大桶。舊的煉廠在石油河畔，每天能燎原油千桶。具有七年歷史的石油城，就是發源在這裏。油田在很早的時候已被發現，爲了戰時需油迫切才來開發。因離城市很遠，供應困難，致　碍了發展，但這種新興的工業正在　　與繼續的生長中。</p>
<p>回到山邊，繼向左行即到礦場，在頂層的許多井，海拔高約二千五百三十公尺，比其　各井要高二百公尺。最近正繼續向東和南兩方面開採，因爲那邊的油田比這邊的希望大，倘若器材充足，由於此間全體員工的精力與經驗，必能先成遭種計劃。（按：本文係由王夢白君節述甘靑油田調査隊隊員英籍畢乃克先生上年參觀老君廟後的一段日記　成·）</p>

<p>— 白永</p>
<p>最近由上海回南京，火車票雖是漲到二百餘萬，但只一斗米的價錢，較之其他，還是便宜，因此沿站上下的旅客極多，而且大多數不再考慮二等和三等的差數，貧窮反而使人奢侈，也是一個奇迹。車到鎭江，除一部分先搶到鎭江南站去上車的，可以找到座位以外，在鎭江登車，只右擁在人叢中站立；我靠近窗口坐着，兩位年靑的旅客，一眼瞄着座位有空，先將將手提包拋了進來，占好位子，然後從窗洞一跨而入，別人在車門擁擠的時候，他們已在那裏洋洋自得的扇着蒲扇了。</p>
<p>可是他們立刻就把車窗上的鐵紗窗放了下來。我說：「天氣這樣悶，又沒有風砂，放他作什麼？」他答得好：「這樣他們就不能再從窗子進來了！」我不由大怒：「你怎麼這樣自私自利？豈有此理！」隨手把紗窗拉起來：「你看，除你以外，還有誰從車窗爬進？」到底有點義正詞嚴，兩位客官，兀自不敢作聲。我腦筋裏因此浮起若干影象，總覺得他們代表了台上和合下的不同作風。</p>
<p>中國自古是講究「躬自厚而薄責於人」的，這就愈加反映了責人常明責已常暗的毛病。而且因爲地位之不同，主張前後頓異，先後判若兩人的事，更是隨在多有。我在旁觀者的立塲，甚至有些討厭自己的座位上首先坐滿了人，故而大聲反對他們爬窗，假設我是等待登車的旅客呢，那就另是一種想法。桂柳戰役時，上火車逃難，以由窗而入爲常，各車站專有托旅客的屁股以入窗者，每托數百元，爲了一身的安全，絕不惜此數百法幣，而且唯恐不得其窗而入呢。對於那些托人的「掮客」，方感謝之不暇，也就不能怨他勒索。所以我抱怨了兩位鄰居之後，不免又輕輕的有些後悔起來，覺得自己太有失恕道。</p>
<p>到了求生的邊緣，我們會奮鬥，甚至犧牲了別人都可以，因爲到底自己的性命重於他人，這便是所說的「不得已。」戰時逃亡，强有力者常常把弱者從公共交通工具上擠下，可恨固然可恨，但也不無可原。但若在天下承平秩然有序之時，便絕不能寬宥，因爲這是自私心的無理由擴張。我對於兩位旅客的關閉紗窗所以感覺不痛快者，主要因爲他們太偏袒了自己；爲了自己就把他人的便利都犧牲。那麼，由此擴而充之，他們如果上了台，搞起國家大事，一定是殺鷄取蛋主義者，他們不是已欲立而立人；已欲達而達人；却是自己立了（舍正道而不由的）別人就該倒下去，自己達了別人就該倒霉。此一作風，頂頂要不得。</p>
<p>從前讀韓非子說難篇，頗感口吃木訥的韓氏，何以會說出這些專門揣摩人心的話來。原來韓非雖然技術不靈，理論倒是專家，他的基礎無非設身處地而已。可是「設一「處」兩字，眞乃非常之難，因爲人人都會受了職位的蒙敝，而有所不見，好像呂氏春秋「去宥篇」所說的那個小偸，竟敢在市塲上攫人的金條，等到犯了案子，別人問他，他說：「我只看到金條，沒有看見人呀！」雖然是庽言，却不能否定這眞理，我們今日不是也有每根金條加一兩銅的傢伙嗎？蔽人眼目的東西極多，不過金條的明晃晃最易生效罷了。我想台上和台下總是有在一條界限，這界限也足以蒙蔽人的眼目，或者其作用有與金條有瓜葛之處，亦未可知。這便是設身處地陷於不可能之重要原因，而古人在歌誦中有「君乘車，我戴笠，他日相逢下車揖」的話，表面上講是爲不忘舊，爲禮貌，骨子裏說正是要不被一種烏烟瘴氣的雰圍所籠罩。此事看似易易，而實行起來頗有周折，晉惠帝問了蚌聲公私之後，又有天下饑何不食肉糜的笑話，讀書人常於此等處大事訶責，說他是昏君，實則假使我是幽處深宮的晉帝，恐怕連這種「笑話」也說不出。試看惠帝的老子，不是天天只管坐羊車逛宮女，白相他的三千粉黛嗎？鳴呼！</p>

<p>美國人有讀書的習慣，但書刋流品之下，恐怕也無逾於美國，有之，其惟中國乎？譬如美國連環圖畫滿街飛，其誨淫誨盜，與荒乎其唐的程度，殊不下於我國兒童及一般市民之受其毒害。但眞正優秀的列物並不是沒有，最壞的和最佳的竟能並存而不悖，這也許是美國文化傳統的一種「特色」吧？</p>
<p>美國的高級刋物，非純學術性質而能吸收一般高級讀者的，偏重於文藝的有「大西洋」月刋，偏重於思想與當代史乘的有「哈柏斯」雜誌。兩者是美國高級讀書界的姊妹刋，創刋至今都有百年左右的歷史，每期都能銷行十數萬份，因爲普通的美國刋物都要銷行到其他的英語國家，所以十多萬的銷路要算是很可憐了，知識上的「知音」之少，中外是一律的。</p>
<p>「哈柏期」創刊以來，一直保特它類乎十六開本的形式，但自七月份起，改爲大型（類乎「時代」周刊版式），原因是現代的印刷機適宜於印大型，爲了「哈柏斯」要保持它固有的版式，承印者要求增加印刷費百分之廿七，一本好刊物的經濟往往是拮据的，爲了减低成本，「哈柏斯」只能遷就現實，改版本原不是它的初衷。好在形式的變化無一關重要，正如該刋編者所說：「我們改了外套，但不改我們的性格……這仍然是一本懂得讀書的和有意懂得讀書的人們的刊物……」</p>
<p>該刋編者F.L.亞倫，是一個留心當代史的學者，哈佛出身，曾在「大西洋」編者E.塞奇成克處當過助編。他寫過「往事宛如昨」（Only　Yesterday）和「自昨以後」（Since　Yesterday）兩部當代史乘，前者銷過七十五萬册，他不但是一個成功的編者，也是個成功的作家。</p>
<p>「哈柏斯收到的投稿，每月約有一千九百篇，每一篇都經編者讀過。在這些投稿中，時堂有好文章，該刋有幾篇名作也是未經邀約，而自動投來的，可見該刊地位崇高，名家自會不吝賜稿。不久以前，該刋刊過一篇「誰忠於美國」，作者是哥倫比亞歷史敎授H·S·康曼格，講美國的排異心理，便是不約而自己投來的。該文一出，有六萬五千個讀者來信，要求將該文重印。還有前美國陸長史汀生一篇講戰時美國軍事當局如何決定對日本施用原子彈的內幕，是史汀生親自拿了文章送到「哈柏斯」來的，登出來，封面上做了最大的大標題。可見一本刊物。要做到「名作如林」，不是編者專門作揖所做得到的，一定要先做到刊物本身有權威性。</p>
<p>「哈柏斯」的讀者一個月要看一千九百篇原稿，實在是不可想像的事，但這樣一本刊物，主力文章不滿八篇，而常任編輯倒有六位，還有兩位兼職的編輯，才應付得了這繁重的閱稿工作。此事又與我國大不相同，「我們的」編者往往一個人編兩個刋物，甚至編它四個五個，如何還有餘　審閱投來的外稿？一本簡單的月刋用了八位編輯，也是我國不曾有的。</p>
<p>該刋還有一個優點，便是每逢星期二，八位編輯舉行編輯會議，對於下期材料配置，詳細檢討，甚至編輯部的女練習生，也可以來參加意見，而主編亞倫呢，他自己說過：「我祗是一個裁判員罷了。」</p>

<p>凌宵漢閣主於其談會中一再談北大校友，但所談均爲民五以前，及京師大學堂時代之校友。民五以後至民八一時期，閣主此時似已離開北大，故於此一時代之校友，並未談及。其實北大人才輩出，於此數年中爲全盛時代，學生三千餘人，稱全國最高學府，蔡孑民校長復廣羅並蓄，敎授中有思想極陳舊之林琴南辜湯生，有極新之陳獨秀胡適之，學生中份子亦極複雜，有保皇然，國民黨，共產黨，安福系，研究系，軍人（同學通某，曾任吳佩孚之旅長），遺少，五花八門，無奇不有。但因入學試騐極嚴格，（第一試國文，外國文，數學，每科均須在六十分以上。若國文得一百分，數學爲五十九分，則屛不錄取，不得參加第二試。）故份子雖複雜，而絕無濫竽充數者。民十六，北伐成功，備位中央暨各省市之北大校友，幾占全數十分之五以上。憶何敬之主浙政時，長民廳者爲北大敎授馬夷初（叙倫），浙江七十五縣之縣長，有四十六縣爲北大校友。嗣後雖逐漸减少，但分佈全國各機關之北大校友，爲數仍甚可觀也。民八由南洋烟草公司資送出洋之傅斯年，羅家倫，段錫朋等五人，均爲北大校友，當時號稱五大臣出洋。斯五人者，均已蜚聲於時，毌庸贅述。他如最近被特任之考選部長田烱錦（雲靑），亦爲北大民十三畢業之校友，政次沈士遠，爲北大敎授兼事務處主任。田在北大肄業時，沈尙在校任職，昔日師生，今成同寅，亦佳話也。又如最近被簡之湘民政廳長鄧飛黄（民十三經濟系畢業），亦爲北大校友。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] President Chiang flew from the capital to Taiyuan at 9:00 AM on the 22nd aboard a special plane to inspect and give military instructions. Xu Yongchang, Jia Jingde, Yu Jishi, Guo Chan, Hou Teng, Liu Fei, and others also traveled on the plane. The flight returned to the capital at 6:30 PM that evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch of the 22nd] President Chiang, along with Xu Yongchang, Jia Jingde, Liu Fei, Yu Jishi, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, and others, departed from the capital at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, arriving safely in Taiyuan at 11:40 AM. Yan Xishan, the Director of the Pacification Headquarters, Yang Ai'yuan, the Deputy Director, and other party, government, and military leaders were all present at the airport to welcome them. The President, full of energy, inspected the honor guard after disembarking, and then drove with Director Yan to the Pacification Headquarters for a private conversation lasting about an hour. Afterwards, they had lunch together with Yan, Xu, Yang, and others. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, he met with Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, the two Commanders-in-Chief, Zhao Rong, Gao Daozhi, the two Corps Commanders, and Yin Zhou, the Brigade Commander who broke through from Linfen, along with battalion and company commanders. He praised Yin's unit for their heroic fighting in Linfen. Subsequently, he met with responsible persons from various party and government circles, including Hu Zuoyong, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Liang Dunhou, a member of the Provincial Government Committee, and Wang Huaiming, the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, encouraging them to unite in spirit, assist the military, mobilize the masses, and accomplish the mission of eliminating the communist bandits. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the President and his party left Taiyuan and flew back to the capital. It is reported that the President, concerned about the Taiyuan battle situation, originally planned to visit Taiyuan yesterday, but due to the overcast and rainy weather all day, the plane was unable to land. He waited until 3:00 PM in the afternoon before rescheduling the visit for today. The President's plane was the "Sino-American" four-engine special aircraft, which circled twice over Taiyuan at 11:30 AM this morning, causing merchants and civilians to be encouraged and elated upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] When President Chiang met with responsible persons from various party and government circles in Taiyuan today, he first told them that there was absolutely no problem with the safety of Taiyuan. Although the communist bandits are very rampant, reinforcements have been continuously increased, and the defending troops are fighting bravely, and will surely defeat the invading bandit army. It is hoped that the military and civilians will cooperate sincerely under the leadership of Director Yan, strengthen their confidence, and accomplish the mission of eliminating the communist bandits. Recalling the critical situation in Shenyang this spring, which was even more serious than the current situation in Taiyuan, I once went there to encourage the military and civilians of Shenyang with the expectations I have for you comrades today, which not only turned Shenyang from danger to safety, but also dealt a major blow to the communist bandits. I am personally pleased to see everyone united and bravely resisting the bandits under unified command, and I am confident that the Jinzhong battle can be won.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] It is reported that when President Chiang visited Taiyuan, Yan Xishan expressed to the President that he was determined to do everything possible to defend Taiyuan, and believed that Taiyuan could definitely be secured. President Chiang also expressed to Yan Xishan that the central government would do its best to support Taiyuan, continue to send air force to cooperate in the battle, and send large reinforcements to Taiyuan.</p>
<p>Vice President Jia Jingde, who accompanied the President on the inspection of Taiyuan, met with our newspaper reporter after returning to the capital. He said that although the situation in Taiyuan is very urgent at present, the people's hearts are very stable, and Director Yan Xishan is particularly calm and composed. At present, only small groups of bandits are occasionally disturbing within forty miles of the suburbs of Taiyuan. The main force of the bandits is still being blocked by the national army outside of forty miles. The military and civilians of Taiyuan have been trained for a long time and have been fully mobilized. There are more than 3,200 solid bunkers outside the city, and the fortifications are very good. It is believed that the situation in Taiyuan will improve in two or three days. At present, what Taiyuan needs is air force to cooperate in the battle and to increase fresh troops. The central government has already implemented these measures. The problem of food supply may be slightly more difficult in the future than in the past, but the current preparations are sufficient and there is no shortage. Jia expressed optimism about the Taiyuan battle situation and praised the mobilization of the military and civilians of Taiyuan.</p>

<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch of the 22nd] The national army on the northern section of the Peiping-Hankow Railway has taken the upper hand. The infantry and cavalry are now dividing into three routes, east, west and middle, to encircle and suppress the bandits to the south, and are responding to the national army in Baoding from afar.

The 19th and 20th Brigades of the 7th Column of the bandits were surrounded by the national army in Taibaoying, Changle and other villages on the south bank of the Caohe River and annihilated separately. At noon, the bandits collapsed and fled eastward across the railway. The national army recaptured Caohe in one fell swoop. Only local communists are causing trouble in the suburbs of Baoding. Order in the city is gradually returning to normal. In order to ensure safety, the military has concentrated all the teachers, students and staff of schools and institutions outside the city into the city. Prices have soared in recent days, but have now fallen back.</p>

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch of the 22nd] Bandit disturbances were discovered in Da Xiaotangshan in the northern suburbs of Peiping last night. They retreated after the national army went to suppress them. Today, all railway lines north of Peiping were cut off. The Peiping-Tientsin railway was destroyed in three places at Langfang, seven miles northwest and seventeen miles southeast of Langfang at zero hour. There was also damage near Beicang. From morning to night, the Peiping-Tientsin passenger train has not yet resumed between Luofa and Langfang. The Peiping-Zhangjiakou Railway is now open to Shunyi. It is reported that there was also minor damage near Xihouzi on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Tientsin Dispatch of the 22nd] About 20,000 troops from the communist bandit Nie Rongzhen's two columns fled west from the Xianghe and Wuqing area. After midnight on the 21st, they crossed the Peiping-Tientsin Railway between Luofa and Langfang to flee west, attempting to aid the bandit army on the Peiping-Baoding line. Fierce fighting broke out west and north of Wuqing, and stopped at dawn on the 22nd. A part of the communist bandits near Luofa are still entrenched.</p>

As of the 22nd, a total of six columns have gathered around Tai'an, Laiwu, Zibo, and other areas around Jinan. At the same time, in recent days, the bandits have been using trucks or large carts to transport grain, ammunition, and new recruits from the north bank of the Yellow River, passing through Gaoyuan and transporting them to Zhoucun.

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 22nd] In the Northeast Wheat War, the national army has achieved a victory. In the thousands of miles of wheat fields in southern Liaoning, the military and civilians are busy harvesting. It is estimated that 60 million jin can be harvested, half of which is enough for three months of military rations. In the fertile plains crisscrossed by the Liao River, Hun River, and Taizi River, the government and the military are cooperating to establish four purchasing stations in Liaozhong, Pangjiaxiang, Lengzibao, and Xiaobeihe. According to the Shenyang grain price, the wheat is purchased from the people at a fixed price of 80,000 old circulation coupons per jin. Those who do not want to sell will be issued grain coupons by the government (public transportation and public storage). Farmers, who are particularly fond of their hard-earned harvest, once requested "private transportation and private storage." After the purchasing agencies explained the situation in detail, they realized that the government's measures were to protect farmers' wheat harvest and prevent the bandits from looting, and they gladly sold or received grain coupons. Since the 19th, purchases have reached more than one million jin. Ten new American-style wheat threshers are currently working in the Northeast. From harvesting to becoming wheat grains, it takes five minutes to produce two hundred market jin. According to Guo Keti, Director of the Liaoning Construction Office, 760,000 mu of wheat are planted in the seven counties surrounding Shenyang. This year's harvest is excellent, with an estimated yield of 51,000 tons. The population of Shenyang City is one million, and the population of the seven surrounding counties is one and a half million, averaging 40 jin per person.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The Legislative Yuan held its fifth secret meeting on the 22nd to continue discussing the general budget. President Sun continued to request leave due to illness, and Chen Guyuan was elected as chairman. The budget under the Ministry of Finance was discussed first and passed after being revised according to the review opinions. The main points included: (1) Eliminating the budgets of the three tax management bureaus in the Northeast that have not been established. (2) The customs agency should be streamlined and adjusted by the Ministry of Finance to save waste. (3) Increasing the 1.4 trillion yuan for tax collection and business expansion was eliminated. (4) Retaining the 100 billion yuan for the preparatory expenses for the collection of property tax, and approving its use after the property tax law is passed and implemented. (5) The budgets of the local financial management bureaus are still listed as usual. According to the previous deliberations on cutting them down during the group and comprehensive reviews, the joint review rejected the proposal to cut them down, and no one raised new opinions at yesterday's meeting. Then the budget under the Ministry of Education was discussed. The review opinion was that during the current period of suppression, the military expenditure was huge. Therefore, in accordance with the constitutional provision that the central education expenditure should not be less than 15% of the total budget, only the ordinary departments were calculated and listed sufficiently. Some members raised objections, believing that the special departments were not included in the calculation, which was a violation of the constitution. As for how to use the 4.5 trillion yuan of education expenditure after making up the difference, opinions were also divided. Some advocated using it for universal basic education throughout the country, while others advocated using it to accommodate students in the pacification areas and various temporary educational facilities. As for training expenses, some also believed that they should be transferred from the education department to various agencies. However, according to the constitution, the Legislative Yuan cannot make a resolution to increase the budget and cannot make up for the educational expenses that the Executive Yuan did not list. After an hour and a half of debate, it was resolved that the sixth review group of the Budget Committee should meet with the Education and Culture Committee in the evening to study together, summarize various different opinions, and submit them to the Yuan meeting on the 23rd for decision. Then the budget under the Ministry of Education was discussed and, after an hour and a half of heated debate, it was resolved to submit it to the Education and Culture Subcommittee of the Budget Committee for re-review, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00.</p>
<p>The secret meeting continued at 4:30 PM to discuss the general budget. The parts under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and Administration and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry were passed without objection according to the review opinions. The budget of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice and Administration and its subordinate agencies was temporarily retained and will be reviewed after its organizational law is determined. For the budget of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, some members advocated overturning the resolution passed by the joint meeting to abolish the fuel management committee, flower management committee, and industry and commerce guidance office under the ministry. After debate, the voting results were: (1) The fuel management committee and fuel management measures were still abolished. During the transition period, the fuel management business will be handled by the ministry in conjunction with the Resource Committee and the Coal Industry Association. (2) The flower management committee and the industry and commerce guidance office were also abolished. Later, a temporary motion was discussed regarding the Wang Zhibin drug trafficking case (this news is published on page 4).</p>

<p>Urging Prevention of Erroneous US Policy</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] A recently established Anti-Japanese Industrial Revival Association here today issued an open letter to the American people, believing that advocating the restoration of Japan's economic strength, thereby restoring its military power to engage in aggression, is an erroneous policy of the US government. They urged the American people to prevent it. The wording in the letter was exceptionally peaceful, stating that they, like the American people, do not believe that Japan will quickly become a peace-loving democratic country. It also stated that rebuilding Japan as an anti-communist fortress will promote its aggression. Japan often uses anti-communism as a pretext to carry out its aggression, and there is no guarantee that this will not happen again, avoiding the suffering of both China and the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Yangtze River Floods and Water Conservancy Construction <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Since April this year, the water level of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has suddenly risen, breaking historical records. In previous years, flood control work along the Yangtze River started around June 15th, but this year it was破early, starting on May 15th. The water level in Hankou was "22.821" on May 15th, exceeding the water level of the same period in 1931; by July 18th, the water level continued to rise to "26.36",比lower than the water level of the same period during the 1931 major flood by 1.92 meters. Hankou is the source of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, where hundreds of rivers converge, so the rise and fall of the water level in Hankou has become the indicator of the height of the Yangtze River's flow. Currently, heavy rains in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have caused disasters, and the water flow in the lake area has a tendency to overflow. The water levels in Chongqing and the Three Gorges are rising sharply every day, and ships traveling up and down are all docked in Yichang, not daring to risk going west. In Hunan, more than ten counties around Dongting Lake have seen their embankments collapse, and the former granary has become a reservoir. The people along the lake are trapped in the water, and their future survival is uncertain. If such a dangerous situation is not rescued as soon as possible, the harm to farmland in the provinces along the Yangtze River and the impact on the lives of millions of people will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River, also known as the Yangzi River, is a major tributary collected from thousands of streams and rivers in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces. It rises from the plateau and flows towards the sea. Geographically and economically, it is crucial for the survival and prosperity of the people on both sides of the river. Although the Yangtze River flows for thousands of miles, its source and destination are clear and smooth, unlike the muddy Yellow River. The waters of the Yangtze River rarely break through embankments and cause disasters, harming the people, so historians and poets of all dynasties praised the Yangtze River as a clear stream rather than a source of disaster. The major flood in 1931 created an unprecedented catastrophe in the three towns of Wuhan, an unfortunate page in the history of the Yangtze River. However, the cause of the 1931 flood was due more to human negligence than natural factors. Due to the unprecedented lessons of the 1931 flood, the National Government actively sought water conservancy, paying attention to building embankments and flood prevention. Local governments in various provinces also began small-scale water conservancy facilities, dredging water sources and rivers, and achieved great results over the past ten years. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, most provinces along the river fell into enemy hands. Under the Japanese invaders' policy of "destruction without construction," even some passive embankment and flood prevention work was abandoned and neglected. Therefore, in the three years after the victory and restoration, floods occurred along the rivers and lakes of the Yangtze River from time to time. There are two reasons for the rise in the water level of the Yangtze River this year and the current disasters in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces: (1) Due to the sudden high water level during the winter peach blossom flood and frequent heavy rains after April this year, the water level along the river rose sharply; (2) The early arrival of the flood season in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River by a month is purely a natural factor. As for the major floods around Dongting Lake, they are due to the fact that embankments, ditches and canals have been in disrepair for a long time due to the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, and now they have unfortunately suffered natural persecution, resulting in the flooding of the earth and the formation of today's disaster.</p>
<p>Having understood the importance of the Yangtze River and the causes of the flood, we should discuss the ways and methods of water conservancy administration. In modern countries, there are three ways to manage river affairs: (1) Dredge rivers to avoid floods; (2) Organize waterways to facilitate transportation; (3) Develop water conservancy to promote industry. The US TVA plan has turned the "American Yellow River," which often flooded and destroyed houses and soil, into a blessing for the people. All countries in the world are shocked by the greatness of its engineering and its functions. The success of the US TVA plan is the highest degree of efficiency in water conservancy administration measures; in a passive sense, it avoids floods and facilitates shipping, and in a more active sense, it exerts power and promotes industry. This type of measure with far-reaching construction significance is not only needed by capitalist countries, but also urgently needed by agricultural countries on the path to industrialization. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our government originally wanted to implement the TVA plan on the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River, and obtained the support of American engineers to design the Three Gorges Reservoir plan. Unfortunately, this great project was shelved halfway, which is regrettable. The Three Gorges Reservoir construction plan is as important as the Tanggu port construction and the Huangpu port construction. If we consider the significance of preventing floods, the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir will benefit the people of the provinces along the Yangtze River even more greatly than the Tanggu and Huangpu port construction projects. Now, floods are occurring along the Yangtze River, and the situation is dangerous. From the active point of view of governing river affairs, we advocate the restoration of the Three Gorges Reservoir project, which is a measure to fundamentally eliminate floods and develop industrial power to build the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. From the passive point of view of governing river affairs, water conservancy authorities and local governments, engineers and the people along the river should learn the spirit of blocking the breach and closing the gap at the Huayuankou of the Yellow River, use their wisdom and manpower to quickly carry out rescue and close the gaps, and eliminate disasters.</p>
<p>The current floods on the Yangtze River are affecting the upper reaches and the Xiang and Han rivers. The seriousness of the situation is like the eve of the closing of the gap at the Huayuankou of the Yellow River last year. If a major disaster occurs, the chaos will be even greater than the Wuhan flood of 1931, which is what we must first be vigilant about. Currently, flood control work has begun in the provinces along the river, but the rescue work is not being done well enough, and the mobilization of the people is also insufficient, causing excessive panic among the residents along the river. In short, rescuing and blocking the breach is an urgent action. One must not have the mentality of "leaving it to fate" and thinking that it is impossible to control. The government and the people, engineering and planning, must have the spirit of reversing the universe in order to overcome nature. We are concerned about the current floods on the Yangtze River, so we call on the local governments of the provinces along the river to quickly mobilize the people and, with the courageous spirit of the Yellow River closure, actively begin rescue and flood prevention work to eliminate the potential for major disasters that may occur during the early flood season on the Yangtze River, in order to celebrate peace and tranquility.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the waters of the Yangtze River are as clear as a mirror, and it is not a source of chaos, nor is it a poisonous snake or beast that harms the people; its vastness and flowing waters must have a clear and smooth return, as long as it is effectively guided by human power, and not allowed to change naturally, flowing east when decided to the east, and flowing west when decided to the west, then the waters of the Yangtze River, which benefit the people and facilitate transportation, will be a smooth road in the human world.</p>

In the current situation of both funds and materials being in short supply, the only option is to mobilize the people to step up repairs and defenses, and to immediately set up water level stations in various counties to monitor and report water level flows at any time to prevent 万一.</p>

However, the farmers in districts 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 under the jurisdiction of this county are planting a lot because the price of cotton is higher, and it is expected that the production of coarse cotton may increase.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] The Sui Jing Public Security Command executed two communist bandits, Li Darong and Xu Jianye, on the 22nd for plotting wrongdoings. Li, alias Tang Chaoxing, was the leader of the communications group and the director of the munitions factory of the communist bandits in Liangshan and Dazhu. When he was arrested in Daguan Township, Liangshan on February 23, a radio receiver, a complete set of gun-making machinery, totaling 268 pieces, a homemade pistol, 28 bullets, 10 revolver bullets, 10 hand grenades, and 14 rifles were seized. When Yu Yu-Xi bandits fled west, he actively mobilized the bandits in Dachuan, Dazhu, and Nanyue in an attempt to respond. Xu Jianye used many aliases and was the secretary of the Chongqing Communist Bandit Municipal Committee and the labor movement. He attempted to launch an armed village riot, using the accountant of Zhicheng Industrial Company at No. 91 Zhongzheng Road, Yuzhong as cover, inciting labor unrest, and probing the production situation of the national army and various military factories. He was also responsible for guiding the liaison of bandits in various places. The gun-making machinery and materials of the bandits in Linshui and Dazhu were supplied by him.

<p>[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd] According to Hong Kong news, the cause of the accident of the Hong Kong-Macau route airliner "Macau Miss" is very suspicious. Because the aircraft is a twin-engine amphibious aircraft, and the accident occurred a few minutes after departure, if the aircraft parts were damaged, it could also descend slowly and would not crash into the sea and sink. Moreover, the weather was very good that day, and no explosion was heard when the aircraft crashed, which is different from the testimony of the only surviving passenger, Huang Yao. The Hong Kong De Chen Western Daily reported that the aircraft accident was due to someone intending to carry out an aerial robbery, and the Macau police authorities are currently investigating and researching it.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Content of the CCP's Resolution on Yugoslavia <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, dated July 10th, was broadcast by Xinhua News Agency. This agency has previously published an abstract; the full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully agrees with the resolution passed by the Information Bureau meeting, attended by the Communist Parties of Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and Italy, regarding the issue of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Holding this meeting and passing this resolution is the duty of international communists to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism and to defend the revolutionary cause of the working class and the people of all countries. It is their duty to defend the cause of world peace and democracy and to protect the people of Yugoslavia from the deception and aggression of American imperialism.</p>
<p>(2) The leadership group of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, represented by "Tito," "Kardel," "Djilas," and "Ranković," violated the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism in their treacherous and erroneous actions, both domestic and foreign. These violations include the principled differences between socialist and capitalist countries, the necessity and importance of international aid for revolutionary movements in various countries, the class struggle and the leading role of the bourgeoisie in the people's revolutionary cause, the party as the highest organizational form of the class, and the role of democratic centralism and internal criticism and self-criticism within the party. Consequently, they have fallen into the mire of bourgeois nationalism and bourgeois political parties. The Tito group, because it implements anti-Marxist-Leninist domestic and foreign policies, because it has adopted an anti-Soviet stance, suppressed internal party criticism, refused fraternal criticism from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and five other Communist Parties, refused to participate in the Information Bureau meeting, and continues to suppress correct opinions within and outside the Yugoslav party after the publication of the Information Bureau's resolution, and continues to be hostile to international communism, has seriously damaged the cause of the people of Yugoslavia and made the enemies of Yugoslavia rejoice. The Chinese Communist Party earnestly hopes that internationalist elements within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia will resolutely rise up to correct the mistakes of the Tito group and bring the Communist Party of Yugoslavia back onto the path of Marxism-Leninism and the path of proletarian internationalism.</p>
<p>(3) The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the events that have occurred within the Yugoslav party are not accidental or isolated phenomena. They are a reflection of the class struggle within the ranks of the proletarian revolution. As long as countries with classes exist, opportunists with bourgeois counter-revolutionary viewpoints will always attempt to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat and the Communist Party, attempting to use opportunities to undermine the revolutionary cause from within. This situation has occurred many times in the international communist movement. Within the Chinese Communist Party, it has manifested as Chen Duxiuism and Zhang Guotaoism. This situation requires communists to strive to raise their awareness and strengthen the education in Marxist-Leninist theory, in order to timely identify and oppose these bourgeois elements and protect the cause of the proletariat and the people from destruction and loss, and protect the ideological and political purity of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided that all party cadres should conscientiously study the resolution of the Communist Information Bureau meeting on the issue of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, in order to strengthen the education within the party on the spirit of class-based, party-based, internationalist self-criticism and discipline.</p>
<h3 id="e51">For Aid to China to Succeed, Self-Help by the Chinese People is Crucial: Mr. Lapham's Broadcast Speech in Nanjing Last Night <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 22nd] Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Mission of the Economic Cooperation Administration of the United States, broadcast a speech entitled "The Mission of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China" on the American Military Advisory Group radio station in Nanjing at 7:15 PM on July 22nd. Mr. Lapham first stated that his speech was mainly addressed to the American expatriate community in China.</p>
<p>Mr. Lapham believes that China's current situation is undoubtedly more difficult and different than that of any other country receiving American aid. Mr. Lapham said: "Currently, we propose to use $70 million to purchase food urgently needed by the Chinese people, and $70 million to purchase raw cotton, so that the proceeds from the sale of the manufactured yarn and cloth can be used to purchase other manufactured goods or exchange for other commodities. We also propose to use $50 million to purchase petroleum products - to provide power to yarn mills and industries that need power - to provide gasoline to China's buses, trucks, and commercial aircraft, and other major public utilities that rely on petroleum products. We propose to use $13 million to purchase fertilizers to increase food production. We propose to grant or lend China $70 million to purchase parts - to restore machinery and equipment - or to build factories, expand production, and assist China in improving its transportation infrastructure. The China Mission of the US Aid also has another task, which is to fund the Rural Reconstruction Committee, which will be established jointly by China and the United States. The purpose of this committee is to provide long-term assistance to rural areas - helping farmers develop better farming methods and promoting higher living standards. A portion of all our funds will be allocated to the expenses of this committee; the exact amount has not yet been determined."</p>
<p>"The China Mission is currently discussing with the Chinese government what policies should be adopted to sell the food, cotton, fertilizer, and petroleum products that we supply on the Chinese market. Colleagues of the Mission firmly believe that the majority of these goods should be sold at what we call realistic prices - that is, prices sufficient to reflect the cost when they land in China. The Chinese currency proceeds from the sale of goods will be kept separately, and their use will be determined through consultation between the Chinese government and the Economic Cooperation Administration. A portion of the Chinese currency revenue will be used to fund the expenses of our program implementation in China."</p>
<p>Mr. Lapham reiterated: "My six weeks here have made me aware of the difficulties facing this Mission - I am well aware that we will be blamed for many of the policies adopted by the Mission. This blame may or may not be justified; however, our responsibility is undeniable. All we can do is use our best judgment at all times to cope with any circumstances. But there is another responsibility that the Chinese people should be aware of, namely that unless the Chinese people are determined to fully help themselves, this program or any other program cannot succeed in aiding China. Self-help must be utilized in every possible way. If we want this program to truly and permanently benefit the Chinese people, full cooperation is essential. It is no exaggeration to say that if China hopes that our country will pass increased American aid next year, then China must automatically engage in more self-help work than it is currently doing. China has a problem of currency inflation - this is a mild way of putting it - but my impression is that the Chinese government is failing to collect the taxes it should be collecting because the Chinese people are paying too little for the goods and services obtained through foreign exchange. There is a view that has been verified in many ways, namely that Chinese farmers are actually subsidizing large cities; and there are many people in the large cities who can pay more taxes now to cover national expenses. For example, at a cost equivalent to one or two US dollars, one can fly from Shanghai to Nanjing. Travelers who use air transport, which relies on foreign exchange for a large part of its operating expenses, can and should pay far more than this. In the United States, traveling such a distance would cost at least five times as much. It seems reasonable to limit the gasoline used for sightseeing. Gasoline is obtained through foreign exchange; why not set a realistic price for it, and why not restrict sightseeing trips in accordance with the practices of European countries? In addition, there are many other measures that can make up for the shortfall in China's budget. Why not adopt a strong self-help plan to study and implement these measures?"</p>
<p>Mr. Lapham also emphasized: "The Chinese people are a great nation with centuries of cultural background and a spirit of hard work and endurance. The Chinese people and the American people have many things in common. We both love individual freedom, we both like to have a relaxed adjustment in daily life, and we both do not want to be controlled by others. However, both the Chinese and American people must remember that we are living in a rapidly changing era. To strive for protection in the current turbulent world, we cannot stand idly by."</p>
<p>Before concluding his speech, Mr. Lapham reiterated: "If the United States is to continue the Marshall Plan to help China and other countries, both sides must have a willingness to help each other. This willingness must be expressed mutually, not unilaterally." Mr. Lapham said, "I know that when I say that the United States is willing to continue to help China, I am actually speaking on behalf of my superior, Mr. Hoffman, the administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration; but if we are going to continue to help China, then Mr. Hoffman and I must be able to assure Congress this winter - the only body that can approve continued aid - that the people of China, the central government of China, and the provincial and municipal governments are all striving to make full use of the money of American taxpayers."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman stated at a press conference on the 22nd that the prospects for world peace are unusually bright. He also said that he does not intend to mention the Berlin crisis and the international situation in the message he will submit to the special session of Congress next Tuesday. The President met with Secretary of State Marshall and Lieutenant General Clay, the US Military Governor of Germany, on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Secretary of State Marshall has begun important talks on the Berlin crisis with General Clay, the US military government official who has just returned to the US from Germany. Washington officials, in view of the great attention paid to these talks by all parties, specifically urged American and foreign journalists in advance not to make sensational reports on the Berlin situation. In London, Prime Minister Attlee also convened the Cabinet to review the international situation and the Berlin crisis at 10 Downing Street. Foreign Secretary Bevin reported on the proceedings of the Hague Western European Union Consultative Committee meeting and the content of the three powers' draft reply to the Soviet note. British Imperial Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery arrived at the Prime Minister's residence before the Cabinet meeting and also participated in the meeting. The new note from the Western Three Powers to the Soviet Union can be submitted once the new French Cabinet is formed and agrees to the content of the note. External spokespersons admitted that it is feared that it will not be possible to deliver it before the weekend.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Soviet Union suggested today that coal, electricity, raw materials, and food be supplied to the western sector of Berlin. Berlin Communist leader Mader stated at a Communist Party meeting that the Soviet Union will supply fuel and raw materials to the western sector of Berlin. He emphasized that aid to Berlin has already been launched, and there should be no factory shutdowns and no unemployment. At the same time, observers expect that the Western Allies will ignore the Soviet Union's proposal. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office in London stated that the Western powers will step up the airlift of food and coal to Berlin and will not change their policies because of the Soviet Union's proposal. At the same time, the Berlin Soviet Zone announced on Berlin radio that residents of the entire city of Berlin can collect their full rations from the Soviet Zone from August 1st. The Soviet authorities previously announced that they would allocate 100,000 tons of grain for the Berlin city authorities to distribute.</p>
<h3 id="e53">New French Cabinet Formed: Blum as Foreign Minister, Reynaud as Finance Minister <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London broadcast on the 22nd: Reynaud, who served as Prime Minister during the war, has agreed to serve as Finance Minister in the Marie cabinet. It is also known that veteran Socialist Blum is prepared to accept the position of Foreign Minister. Reynaud's decision will give the new Prime Minister 25 votes from the right-wing Independent Republican Party in parliament, and Blum's acceptance of the position of Foreign Minister can win Marie 103 votes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The work of forming a cabinet by new French Prime Minister Marie has been hindered due to the fundamental political positions of the Socialist Party and its Radical Socialist Party. Marie held continuous talks with leaders of the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Party, and the Independent Republican Party. Leaders of the Popular Republican Party stated after the meeting that no agreement had been reached on financial plans. Socialist Party leaders Mollet, Laumaillé, and Roche all met with Marie. Mollet said, "There are more problems than candidates."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] Radical Socialist Party leader Marie held a series of meetings on the 22nd after being appointed to form a cabinet to discuss the lineup of the new government. French political veteran Blum will replace Bidault as Foreign Minister. Marie is also considering ousting Defense Minister Teitgen from the cabinet.</p>
<p>Bidault has been dissatisfied with almost all political circles since signing the London Six-Power Agreement, especially the Popular Republican Party to which he belongs. When Schuman's cabinet fell, the Radical Socialist Party was criticizing Teitgen. Marie's ideal candidate for Foreign Minister also includes wartime Prime Minister Reynaud, and the two had a meeting on the evening of the 21st. Marie said that if he decides to accept President Auriol's order to form a cabinet, he will request the National Assembly to convene on the 23rd to pass his appointment. Marie plans to form a broad national coalition government that includes all parties and factions except the Communist Party. Since the 183 votes of the Communist Party will oppose Marie, Marie's cabinet will be aborted if there are another 160 opposing votes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] President Auriol today asked right-wing Radical Socialist Party member Marie to try to form a new cabinet. Marie is fifty years old and in good health, and almost died in a Nazi concentration camp during the war. The big problem he faces is how to win over the Socialist Party in Schuman's cabinet. The party insists on government control of the economy, while the Radical Socialist Party advocates the greatest possible private economic freedom. The Socialist Party will decide tonight whether to participate in the new cabinet, depending on Marie's economic policies. At the same time, Marie declared to the Radical Socialist Party that he will continue to pursue the financial and economic propositions of Finance Minister Mayer ★. It is not easy to say how the two will be reconciled for a while.</p>

<p>[United Press, Pawling, New York, 22nd] Republican presidential candidate and Governor of New York Dewey declared here today that he is cooperating with the Truman administration to find ways to break the Soviet blockade of Berlin, but is trying to avoid triggering a war. My foreign policy advisor Dulles is in constant contact with Secretary of State Marshall and is constantly reporting to me on the details of the Berlin situation. The Berlin situation is indeed serious, and a slight carelessness is enough to cause a great disaster. The Republican Party is extremely concerned about it, and this matter must be handled with extreme caution. What people are most concerned about is to seek reconciliation and to honorably defend world peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] US Republican presidential candidate Dewey and losing candidate Stassen held a "friendly meeting" in Philadelphia today after competing in the convention to discuss the diplomatic crisis in Berlin and urged government officials to handle this serious situation with extreme caution. The two issued a statement after the meeting that was rather vague and contained no concrete suggestions for solving the Berlin problem, but the statement was very political. Stassen pointed out after the meeting that the Berlin problem was originally caused by Truman and Stalin during the Potsdam Conference, so the intention of the above statement is obvious.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] US government officials are carefully studying reports from Czechoslovakia that indicate that this Soviet-controlled country is being taken over by extremists blindly following the Kremlin. Reports indicate that the Czech government may be transferred from the hands of "moderate" Communists to Premier Zapotocky, former trade union leader, and Slansky, Secretary-General of the Czech Communist Party. US authorities believe that this change is orchestrated by the Soviet Union, which is increasingly determined to tighten control over its vassals after the "rebellion" of Yugoslav Communist Tito. Telegrams from Prague have rumors that are still in the rumor stage, and the rest have been officially confirmed and are well known.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Can the Soviet Union Launch a War? (Part 1) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Cai Jinsheng</p>
<p>Can the Soviet Union launch a world war? This is the first question we face today. The Soviet Union's war plan must be based on its industrial economy, just like the wrath of the United States at home. Although information about the Soviet economy is not very adequate, many basic facts are unavoidable. Let us start with the Soviet Union's population and its plans. It is wrong for the average person to think that the Soviet Union's vast territory possesses extreme wealth and ability.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's territory is forty-five times larger than Germany, but more than half of its territory is forested, nearly one-fifth is desert or semi-desert, and only one-eighth is fertile. The Soviet Union has a population of 192 million, and its agricultural area is about the same size as the United States, which has a population of 142 million. Therefore, the Soviet Union's food production cannot meet the needs of an increasing population. In fact, the Soviet Union will continue to be a famine-stricken country.</p>
<p>Fifty million people in the Soviet Union have been displaced, resulting in losses in the vast forest areas and northern tundra regions. Therefore, the Soviet Union's population production is only as much as the United States.</p>
<p>Most of the Soviet Union's factories are concentrated in a triangular area west from Leningrad and Ukraine, east to the new industrial area of Siberia. This is a small part of the Soviet Union's entire territory, but it is the main source of economic development. This triangular area is very unsafe.</p>
<p>Currently, the Soviet Union's industrial production has not yet reached the level of the United States forty-eight years ago.</p>
<p>We know that Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom suffered war damage, but the Soviet Union suffered the most severely. The Soviet Union lost 58 percent of its railway vehicles, 45 percent of its steel, 44 percent of its electricity, and 55 percent of its coal production. It also lost a quarter of its livestock, millions of houses, buildings, and bridges.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, the Soviet Union's economic potential compared to the United States' ability fell from 42 percent to 25 percent. If the Soviet Union's reconstruction work proceeds smoothly—which it does not in reality—then it will have the same industrial productivity as the United States in 1904 (forty-four years ago) in 1951. By 1960, its production could reach the level of the United States in 1938.</p>
<p>On February 9, 1946, when Stalin announced the Fourth Five-Year Plan, he said: "The basic task includes restoring the pre-war eternal standard in industry and agriculture, and then exceeding this even more or less. ... To accomplish this task, perhaps three new five-year plans will be needed. But we must do this." If we carefully study these basic steps and analyze Stalin's goals, it is generally obvious, but the Soviet Union will never complete a five-year plan.</p>
<p>Stalin announced that the goal was to produce 60 million tons of oil in 1951, and twenty-eight years ago, free Americans had already achieved this goal. In 1947, the United States produced 270 million tons. The Soviet Union's oil supply is very poor, so it always uses coal and other fuels as much as possible.</p>
<p>Swedish fuel engineers have found that 30 percent of the Soviet Union's coal production is used for automobiles, and another 30 percent is used for electricity production. So, only 40 percent is left for the Soviet Union's coal-fired industry, including coal for steel. Stalin hoped that his five-year plan would produce 500 million tons of coal in 1951, and the United States already had this amount thirty years ago. Stalin requested that the new five-year plan (or next one) produce 60 million tons of steel by the end. The United States had already produced almost 50 percent before the end of World War II. The Soviet Union lacks several important strategic raw materials for launching a war—manganese, tin, antimony. Especially rubber. It has no safe transportation lines overseas to obtain rubber, and it cannot establish complete factories to produce synthetic rubber.</p>
<p>However, the most remarkable thing about the Soviet Union is transportation. On the surface, its ships are not overly backward. Before the war, its merchant ships had one million tons—equal to Sweden's tonnage—almost twice the size of the US lend-lease ships and the pre-war German, Italian, and Finnish reparations ships. Moreover, Japanese ships were scheduled to build 175 ships for the Soviet Union in exchange for coal and coke.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union's territory has an astonishing need for its limited domestic transportation. There are few and broken highways. The only important highway is the line from Moscow north to Leningrad, west to Minsk, and south to Kyiv and Kharkiv. In major cities, trucks are mainly used.</p>

<p>Wang Zhibin, a legislator elected from Rehe Province, boarded a China National Aviation Corporation "Tyrant" plane from Peiping to Shanghai at 3:40 pm on the 18th. At the airport, customs inspectors and police discovered drugs hidden in his suitcase. Wang and another suspect, Liu Runge, were detained on the spot. The police department transferred all case files and prisoners to the court at noon on the 22nd in accordance with the Special Criminal Law. At 3:00 pm, Shen Tianbao, the presiding judge of the court, opened the court for trial. Wang Zhibin was called first. According to his confession, he is a legislator elected from Rehe Province and took a plane from Peiping on the 18th to go to Nanjing to report to the Legislative Yuan and attend meetings. As for the drugs found by the police in his suitcase, they do not belong to him. He claims that a few days before leaving Peiping, his friend Xu Songjiu asked him to temporarily store the two suitcases at the home of Xu's brother-in-law in Shanghai and that Xu would come to pick them up when he arrived in Shanghai. At the time, he did not know that the suitcase contained drugs. He claimed that Xu Songjiu is from Rehe and that he met him during his election as a legislator. He is now doing business in Peiping. Finally, the defendant solemnly stated that the confession at the police station that the drugs belonged to Liu Runge was a mistake and that what he said at the police station at the time was due to temporary confusion. He also claimed that he had served under General Song Zheyuan for 20 years, obeying the law and had no transgressions. He really did not know about the drugs he was carrying this time. Then, Liu Runge testified that he went to the airport that day to pick up Wang Zhibin because there was no one at Wang's brother-in-law's house to pick him up and was asked to greet him. He also planned to ask Wang Zhibin to introduce him to a job, so he went to greet him, denying any drug trafficking. After the interrogation, the court ordered the detention of the two defendants on the grounds that they were suspected of being involved in a major case.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] At a secret meeting on the 22nd, the Legislative Yuan passed a temporary motion regarding the case of Wang Zhibin, a legislator from the People's Socialist Party in Rehe, transporting drugs from Peiping to Shanghai. In addition to deciding to send a telegram to the Shanghai municipal authorities requesting strict handling, it was also decided to form a "Qualifications Review Committee" and a "Discipline Committee" and to have the Legal System Committee draft organizational regulations to exclude unscrupulous elements to prevent them from disgracing the Legislative Yuan, endangering the country, and tarnishing the reputation of the Yuan. When a committee member asked the Secretariat about the handling of the reported drug trafficking by legislator Wang Zhibin, Secretary-General Zhang reported that Wang Zhibin had not yet reported to the Yuan and that the truth of the matter was unknown due to the lack of detailed reports. Zhang also read the telegram from the Shanghai Police Department to the Legislative Yuan and the Yuan's reply as follows: (1) Telegram: Urgent, To President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Legislator Wang Zhibin boarded a plane from Peiping to Shanghai carrying ten and a half kilograms of opium, which was confiscated by customs and handed over to our bureau. Please telegraph instructions on how to handle the matter as soon as possible. Yu Shuping, Director of the Shanghai Police Department, sealed on the 19th. (2) Reply: "To Director Yu Shuping of the Shanghai Police Department: Received your telegram of the 19th. After investigation, Wang Zhibin has not yet reported to the Yuan. If there is any illegal behavior, he should bear personal criminal responsibility and can be handled according to law. The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, July 20." Wang Shixian, a legislator from the People's Socialist Party, also stated on the matter: "Wang Zhibin is a new member of the party, and his relationship with the party is not deep. His usual behavior is also not very clear. If it is true, he should not only be subject to legal sanctions but also be subject to party discipline."</p>

<h3 id="e76">Standards for Large Water and Electricity Users to Be Determined by Companies Themselves <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Various public utility companies in the city have been greatly affected by recent price fluctuations, and after the cost-of-living index is published every half month, the companies are unable to bear the burden in the second half of each month. They have jointly requested the municipal government to allow them to adjust prices every half month. A person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau said yesterday that the local government has no right to decide on this request because adjusting public utility prices is a national matter and must be approved by the central government. As a temporary measure, they are allowed to charge fees once every half month, but this only applies to large users. When asked about the standards for large users, it was said that there are no rigid regulations and that each company determines its own standards. In terms of tap water, those who use more than 2,000 degrees per month will be asked to pay every half month. It is estimated that there are nearly 500 large users in the city, accounting for 50% of total revenue, which is a small supplement to the company's revenue. In terms of electricity, because the situation in each power company's area is different, the standards set by each company also differ, generally targeting factories and large stores.</p>
<p>According to reporters, Mr. Brock, the general manager of the British Tramway Company, submitted a document to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, stating that the company could not bear the burden after the cost-of-living index was published every half month and asked the authorities to help them borrow 200 billion yuan for emergency relief. The Public Utilities Bureau is currently considering this matter.</p>

If the quality is not different, there will be no malpractice. The warehouse is rewarding all witnesses who discover that the rice quality is not in compliance to report it at any time.</p>

Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhu of the District Prosecutor's Office opened a preliminary hearing for questioning. It is reported that the case is complex and, after questioning, he was released on bail pending further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Counterfeit Ciba Factory Pharmaceuticals Western Medicine Merchant Detained for Investigation <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Wanli Western Medicine Store's product, the expensive male hormone (Hormon) and Bilatrin, were recently proven to be counterfeit by the general factory of the Swiss businessman Ciba Pharmaceutical Factory. The police arrested Xu Zhiliang, the person in charge of the store, and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday. According to reports, the prices of the store's products are extremely high. Fifty-three Chinese and Western pharmacies in the city all wholesale from the store. Previously, the victim, the Swiss businessman Ciba Pharmaceutical Factory in this city, discovered for the first time that the tonic was counterfeit. After reporting to the police, a large number of counterfeit products were seized at the Wuzhou Pharmacy. The Swiss businessman sent them to the general factory of the factory in Switzerland for chemical testing. Recently, the general factory received a reply telegram proving that the products were counterfeit. The Criminal Investigation Section of the police then arrested Xu Zhiliang and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of hindering industry and commerce yesterday.</p>
<p>Committee Formed by Council to Clear Bad Debts of Public Utilities Report Completed Huge Consumption Alarming Accounts</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Council, in accordance with the six instructions issued by the Executive Yuan some time ago on handling public utility prices, yesterday compiled all the materials obtained from previous on-site inspections and produced a detailed report, which will be submitted to the authorities with specific recommendations to actively suppress and stabilize public utility prices. The report attaches great importance to the huge amount of "bad debts" owed by military and government agencies at all levels. According to the operating reports of various companies in March, this expenditure on bad debts is also an important factor in the calculation formula, with the highest reaching 24.96% of the total operating amount. Whenever adjustments are made, they are passed on to general users. The Public Utilities Investigation Committee believes that it is unfair for a small number of people to enjoy benefits while the entire city bears the burden. It has decided to ask the municipal government and the Garrison Headquarters to urge the agencies to clear the debts quickly to reduce the burden on the people. It is reported that the "bad debt expenditure" is the highest for the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company at 83,540,359,341 yuan, followed by the Shanghai Gas Company at 15,683,155,212 yuan, then the French Electric Tramway Company at 7,384,636,167 yuan, and the Huashang Electric Company at 3,634,471,131 yuan. The Shanghai Electric Power Company and others have only small amounts of arrears below 100 million yuan, and the situation is still good. As for the departments that owe the most, the military agencies are the most, followed by the police agencies under the municipal government, municipal hospitals, and universities, which also owe large amounts of money (Tongji University owes more than 4.7 billion yuan in long-term water and electricity fees). It is also learned that some agencies have never paid fees since the early days of the victory in September 1945, so the actual consumption figures are huge and the accounts are alarming.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Examples of Labor-Management Evaluation Committee: Application of Index-Based Wage Payment Methods <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, due to frequent labor disputes following the bi-monthly publication of the cost of living index, previously resolved to create a "Wage Calculation and Distribution Guideline" to provide a basis for both labor and management to follow. However, since the previous resolution only outlined principles, and the provisions of the "Application of Cost of Living Index for Wage Payment Methods" were not clear, disputes often arose between labor and management. Yesterday, the committee provided specific examples to clarify.</p>
<p>(1) For wages paid based on the cost of living index of the current month, they should be calculated and paid separately based on the index of the current period. Example: (A) Monthly wage workers: Divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (B) Piece-rate workers: Multiply the actual base salary for the first half of the month by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; multiply the actual base salary for the second half of the month by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (2) For wages paid based on the cost of living index of the previous month, the current period's wages should be paid according to the previous period's index. Example: (A) Monthly wage workers: Divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (B) Piece-rate workers: Multiply the actual base salary for the first half of the month by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; multiply the actual base salary for the second half of the month by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (3) For wages paid with half the month based on the cost of living index of the previous month and half the month based on the cost of living index of the current month, the wages for the first half of the month should be paid according to the index at the end of the previous month, and the wages for the second half of the month should be paid according to the index at the end of the current month. Example: (A) Monthly wage workers: Divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (B) Piece-rate workers: Multiply the actual base salary for the first half of the month by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; multiply the actual base salary for the second half of the month by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (4) For wages handled in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Shanghai Municipality Temporary Wage Adjustment Measures, "The wages for the second half of the month are calculated uniformly by halving the method," that is, the upper and lower halves of the month each have a base of 15 yuan. For those below 15 yuan, wages are paid in full according to the index. For those above 15 yuan, in addition to the 15 yuan being paid according to the index, the remaining portion is reduced by 10% for every 5 yuan increment. For example, if the base salary for half a month of a piece-rate worker is 20 yuan, the calculation formula is (20-15) x 90 + 15 = 19.5, meaning the base salary is calculated as 19 yuan and 50 cents.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the stone figures were removed, a group of "enthusiastic" individuals are attempting to rebuild their incense offerings. This group, led by film actor Hong Jingling, including Tang Bihua and others, and promoted by famous doctor Ding Fubao, is using the reasons of preserving "historical relics," freedom of belief, and using the proceeds from incense and candles to provide porridge, to request, through the mediation of City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, that the two stone figures be moved to the Fuxing Pudu Temple. Currently, their approach involves asking MGM to write to the municipal government to demand the return of the stone figures to them, and also requesting sponsorship from the City Council, which may potentially achieve their goal.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Collapse of the Jiang堤 in Taicang, Investigation Reveals Eight Places Requiring Emergency Repairs, Residents to Guard Day and Night Before Construction <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since the last typhoon passed through the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, there has been continuous rain for half a month, causing the tides to rise. The seawalls and embankments along the Yangtze River, from Baoshan to the Taicang and Changshu counties, have repeatedly reported emergencies. In particular, the 90-li Jiang堤 in Taicang County has been in disrepair for many years, and the pile stones cannot withstand the erosion. Near Daotang Temple (northeast of Taicang), the Jiang潮 once entered, and the embankment almost completely collapsed. Fortunately, the county magistrate of the county, Xue Peiqi, and the head of the construction section, Zhang Hanqing, supervised the residents and local garrison troops day and night to reinforce the堤, avoiding a breach. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai Office of the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office dispatched section chief Cao Siliang to Taicang for on-site inspection on the 20th. The Su-Hu Seawall Engineering Relief Expert Committee also sent supervising engineer Guan Fuquan, secretary Zhong Huaiqing, and specialist Hou Yanpu to conduct surveys. After consulting with County Magistrate Xue, it was determined that there were eight sections of the Jiang堤 within Taicang County that urgently needed emergency repair: (1)阅兵台 (Reviewing Platform), the pile stones south of the bunker are damaged. (2) Daotang Temple, 220 meters of the pile stone project are damaged. (3) Fangjia Weir, 1.5 kilometers north of Xintang口, the embankment body is thin. (4) Minjia Residence, 269 meters of the seawall are damaged. (5) The outer slope of the Qianjing River口 (now blocked), about 1 kilometer north of Yanglin口, is 38 meters, and erosion is almost complete. (6) The original 65 meters of pile stone engineering north of Qiyakou have been completely washed away. (7) The top of the seawall south of Qiyakou has collapsed, and the fields inside the embankment have been flooded by the tide. (8) 100 meters of the east bank and 35 meters of the west bank of Qianjing口 have been destroyed by erosion. Currently, with the approach of the autumn flood, and with recent rainfall increasing, in order to actively prevent measures, it has been decided to officially establish a construction office on August 1st. The Seawall Engineering Office is responsible for the technical aspects, and the Taicang County Government is responsible for the earthwork and labor. The emergency repair funds will be allocated 40 billion from U.S. aid. The Taicang County Government has now built construction shelters near Liuhe and is starting to organize laborers. These laborers are mostly fishermen who have fled from the Yancheng area of northern Jiangsu. Currently, the fishing season has passed, and they can take this construction opportunity to solve their livelihood problems. According to County Magistrate Xue, after the seawalls in Taicang have been vigorously reinforced, if there are no strong winds or heavy rains recently, there should be no serious consequences. Currently, as the tide is still rising, orders have been issued to pay close attention along the riverbank, and residents will guard day and night before construction to prevent changes. He himself will go to the riverbank again today with Construction Section Chief Zhang to inspect and supervise.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Director Yu of the Municipal Police Department recently received a confidential report stating that in the Ward Road area of Pudong, a "gang" organization of over two hundred members was discovered.

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At around 11:30 PM the night before, a certain clothing store at No. 5 Zhulin Lane, Houjie, Damaji Bridge, outside the Great East Gate, was robbed because the front door was not closed due to the heat. Suddenly, two thugs arrived, one wielding a gun, threatening the store owner Lin Zongyue. The other robber forcefully snatched his gold ring. When the owner resisted, the robber bit his arm, causing it to bleed profusely. The owner's wife, who was nearby, shouted for help regardless of the consequences, angering the robbers. They attempted to draw their guns, but the bullets jammed. This was heard by the patrolling police officer from the Dadao Street Police Station of the Leilai Road Police Precinct, who immediately called the station to report to the precinct.

They captured the two robbers and recovered the stolen goods, taking them to the precinct. According to their confession, one was Zhou Yongting, 21 years old, from Ningbo (formerly in the Peace Preservation Army in his hometown), and the other was Wang Pinshan, 21 years old, from Ningbo. There was also a fellow townsman, Zhang A'kui, temporarily residing in a shantytown on Fuxing East Road. Zhou and Zhang were colleagues two years ago. Recently, Zhang sent a letter to Zhou, saying that Shanghai had potential for development and hoping to start a business together. Zhou and Wang arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Because they had no place to live, they temporarily stayed in the City God Temple. Tonight, at 9:30 PM, Zhang first went to the victim's house to scout and then ordered the two of them to take guns and rob. Based on the confession, the precinct immediately went to the address and apprehended the ringleader Zhang A'kui, and brought him in for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e98">The Fast Train Arrives in Nanjing On Time in Five Hours <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning at 6:45 AM, a train carrying a historical mission departed from Platform 6 of the Shanghai North Station. This fast train, after a steady and swift five-hour journey, completed the first trial run of the entire Shanghai-Nanjing route precisely on time. This not only restored the high efficiency of troop transport from before the war but also, due to the temporary breakdown of the air conditioning equipment, reflected the arduous efforts and spirit of the Railway Bureau staff in overcoming difficulties.</p>
<p>Locomotive P5 type 106, personally driven by Deputy Director Xie Zhen, gently pulled nine streamlined carriages out of the station. The exceptionally smooth "start" was such that almost half of the overly delighted passengers (actually a group of reporters and Railway Bureau staff participating in the trial run) barely noticed the station moving backward.</p>
<p>The train's speed gradually increased from 24 kilometers per hour to 64 kilometers per hour, and after seven or eight minutes, it had passed 翔 [unclear place name]. Although the clouds outside the window seemed to press down on the roof, the people inside were unusually excited. In the dining car in the middle, there were square tables for playing cards, and in the observation car at the end, there were comfortable sofas, which attracted the majority of young men and women, creating the atmosphere of two small clubs. They forgot the fatigue from lack of sleep the night before, and even forgot the gradually increasing temperature inside the carriages.</p>
<p>Average Speed of 60 Kilometers Per Hour</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the dining car was more intense than in the observation car. Besides the three or four tables playing cards, one or two tables were occupied by Railway Bureau transportation department staff, seriously recording the speed of the train every kilometer and at every station, comparing it with the planned schedule. Section Chief Xue told me that the fastest speed of this train could reach 85 kilometers per hour, but due to the limitations of the track and speed through stations, the actual average speed was currently 60 kilometers per hour. The fastest section was when passing Kunshan, where the speed reached 75 kilometers per hour. He said that before the war, the fast train had six carriages and stopped at four stations: Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, arriving in Nanjing in four hours and fifty minutes. The current P5 type locomotive, stopping only at two stations in between, could complete the scheduled five-hour journey to Nanjing without any problems.</p>
<p>Air Conditioning Breakdown - Temperature Spikes</p>
<p>But a problem arose. Shortly after passing Kunshan, passengers in the observation car began moving to the front carriages, noticing that the air conditioning had broken down. The onboard technicians were recording the red line on the thermometer inside the carriages: it reached 83 degrees, and some even went as high as 86 degrees. Engineers and air conditioning technicians were busy inspecting and checking. The conclusion was that one of the three power transmission tubes had broken, and some of the air conditioning units were not powered on, so the temperature lost its proper regulation. Deputy Director Pu of the Machinery Department and other responsible personnel, who were on board to inspect the results, also believed that there might be problems with the ventilation pipes of the Philco air conditioning units in each carriage during installation.</p>
<p>The fast train continued to move forward, and the responsible staff could not go under the carriages to inspect or repair. At 8:05 AM, passing Suzhou Station, the sun broke through the clouds, and the temperature in the carriages increased even more. Some even reached 91 degrees, only slightly lower than the outside temperature.</p>
<p>However, the train's schedule was as accurate as a clock. It arrived in Wuxi at 8:41 AM, stopped for six minutes, passed Changzhou at 9:23:30 AM, and arrived in Zhenjiang at 10:29:30 AM, without the slightest deviation. Only passing the No. 102 bridge under repair at Suzhou Station, it slowed down by two minutes, and passing the diverging track at Suzhou Station also slowed down by one minute, but it made up the time before arriving in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Thus, the fast train pulled into Nanjing Xiaguan Station precisely on time at 11:45 AM, completing the Railway Bureau's expected task of increasing train speed.</p>
<p>Official Launch Date - Still Uncertain</p>
<p>In the afternoon, while Director Peng and others were treating the reporters to strolls around Xinkou or Xuanwu Lake, the streamlined train entered the engine room for maintenance, and Deputy Director Xie and Deputy Director Pu were still sweating profusely repairing the electrical wires and air conditioning.</p>
<p>At 5:50 PM, the train carried us southeast, back to Shanghai. In the dining car, Deputy Director Xie, at the request of reporters, talked about the motivation behind the creation of the streamlined fast train: (1) the Railway Bureau was striving to increase train speed and frequency; (2) it wanted to use the Railway Bureau's existing materials for new structural and technical experiments, hoping to achieve modern international standards on its own. It was absolutely not intended to provide extravagant enjoyment for the wealthy.</p>
<p>In this time of war and chaos, being able to still have this spirit and courage to move forward independently is, of course, beyond reproach. As for the technical details, as long as there is perseverance in continuous research and improvement, as the ancients said, failure is the mother of success. In short, one of the two main goals of the fast train, "train speed," has been absolutely and perfectly achieved. As for the second point, the air conditioning problem, Deputy Director Xie said it would be improved. Regarding whether the official launch would be on the 25th, he shook his head uncertainly.</p>
<p>During the conversation, the fast train had already passed Zhenjiang and encountered a torrential downpour. The carriages were still so stuffy. The windows of the carriages were sealed and could not be opened. Those who couldn't bear the heat stood next to the open carriage doors to cool off. I was lucky enough to find a cool corner in the luggage car, where the door was wide open and there was no luggage, and dozed off until Shanghai. The arrival time at the station was absolutely on time, precisely at 11:50 PM. This was really their only consolation.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Accused of Colluding with Bandits or a Love Triangle? Sun Pusheng of Jiangyin Killed - Father Sues the Court <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Jiangyin, 21st] Sun Pusheng, also known as Zanyu, a resident of Baizhangli, Xiyangqiao, Mazhen Township, is a shareholder and manager of the Xintai Rubber Factory in Shanghai. On the 6th of this month, he was suddenly arrested by Niu Yusheng, the head of the township, on the grounds of colluding with bandits and killed while allegedly trying to escape. After an investigation by our reporter in the countryside, it seems that there are other secrets to this case.</p>
<p>The deceased's father, Sun Guanyue, came to the city with his wife, Wang, on the 10th to file a lawsuit with the county government and the court, seeking redress. According to the lawsuit, his son Pusheng was engaged in commerce and often returned home. A clansman named Sun Yaowei lived in the village of Houqianxiang. His daughter, named Jinyu, was unmarried and had a good relationship with Pusheng due to their kinship. The township head, Yusheng, seeing that Jinyu was somewhat attractive, wanted to woo her for his own selfish desires, but Jinyu ultimately refused. Yusheng saw that Pusheng and the girl were very close and harbored jealousy. On May 11th, he asked the girl's father to borrow two dan of white rice but failed. When Pusheng returned from Shanghai, he wrote a letter requesting to borrow five dan of rice from the girl, which was also rejected, so he had harbored resentment for a long time. Before plotting the shooting, he first sent someone to hide a revolver in the Sun family's house. When Pusheng returned home on the 6th, he was arrested, subjected to torture, and then dragged to the side of Beitou Village on the pretext of escaping and killed. His father was afraid of being framed in the countryside, so he came to the city to appeal to the relevant authorities, urging them to arrest the murderers and redress the injustice.</p>
<p>According to our reporter's investigation: Sun Pusheng once served as an intelligence officer for the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, as certified by Director Cao Zheng. He was not a bandit. His father, Sun Guanyue, has filed reports with the Command Post and the Jiangyin County Government, and has also filed a lawsuit with the local court. During the Anti-Japanese War, Sun Pusheng was recommended by Zheng Ziliang, a councilor of the Loyal Salvation Army, to Guangde, Anhui Province, for training, after which he participated in underground work and was irreconcilable with traitors and bandits. After the victory, he transferred to Lixin Accounting School in Shanghai and co-founded the Xintai Rubber Factory with friends in western Shanghai. After being killed on the 6th, he still had a letter from a certain bandit suppression agency dated May 27th, discussing inquiries about the whereabouts of bandits.</p>
<p>It is reported that after Sun Pusheng was killed, Xing Zizhen, a military law officer from the county, performed an autopsy and found serious injuries from torture between the fingernails and toenails. The perpetrator was Xing Xingbao, a member of the self-defense force. The deceased was shot five times, three times in the head, once in the chest, and once in the leg. Given that he was shot five times in a row, and there were no branching paths on the main road, it seems unlikely that he was trying to escape. It is said that the county government has ordered Wu Zongyuan, the district head of Huangtang, to investigate thoroughly. The court will need to exhume the body for another autopsy to determine whether he was trying to escape or was intentionally shot to death, so that the truth can be revealed.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper, Jiangyin, 21st] Chen Enhou, a villager from Baishui Township, Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, had previously robbed the Yongle steamboat and joined a bandit gang, killing Yang Qingzhen. Some of his accomplices were hiding in the home of Wang Yongsheng in Sanjiali, east of this county. On the 16th, the county police局 and the Houteng security police team arrested Chen Jindu, Chen Shiliu (both from Kukou Township, Yongjia County), Chen Jimin (from Baishui Township, Yongjia County), and Li Chengzhen (from Luwan Township, Yongjia County), who were using cotton flailing as a cover, at Wang's house. They were sent to the county military law office for questioning on the 20th. All denied being bandits, saying that Chen Enhou was currently in Shanghai and they did not know his address. After questioning, they were detained, pending a letter to the Yongjia County Government requesting them to come and pick them up for trial.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] A tragic case of a township head burying a deputy township head alive recently occurred in the Puliu district. Yang Hanlin, the deputy township head of Limin Township in the district, was captured by bandits in June. He managed to escape during the suppression by the National Army, leading to disputes with Township Head Ding Hongru over the return of confiscated bean cakes and pigs, which deteriorated their relationship. Later, he was summoned by the township head to a meeting at the township office but never returned. His body was later found in the Jinjiadian grassland, his mouth and nose stuffed with cotton wool, his hands and feet bound, in a pit five feet deep. When the body was being moved, it was shot at by the township self-defense team. With such obvious clues, it should not be difficult to arrest the suspects. The deceased's family is appealing to all parties for justice.</p>

<p>Wuxi Meat Merchants Resume Business Today</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Suzhou, 22nd] Suzhou fresh meat merchants have stopped slaughtering and trading for two days. Despite repeated mediation, there have been no results. Although the strike was triggered by the government's adjustment of the slaughter tax rate being too high, the meat merchants have long suffered excessive sacrifices and increasing costs in handling military meat. Based on the situation, it is difficult to resolve in the short term.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Wuxi, 22nd] The meat merchants' strike has lasted for two days. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, the county government summoned the slaughter merchants to persuade them. It was agreed that they would resume business first on the 23rd, with the tax rate resolved according to the standards of Suzhou, Changzhou, and other counties. In addition, the newly appointed County Magistrate Zhou, due to the county's financial difficulties, has specially invited the directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce to discuss the issue of collecting business tax and house rent. Also, the Yarn 管 Committee sent personnel to investigate the stored yarn and cloth in various cotton yarn and silk cloth businesses, but there were no results.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Ren Guanshan, Speaker of the Licheng County Council, and others previously accused Yue Bofen, the County Magistrate, of excessive taxation, smuggling for profit, private purchase of firearms, and falsely claiming people's property in a complaint to the Provincial People's Freedom Protection Committee, listing eight major charges against County Magistrate Yue. Li Zong [unclear], the Vice Speaker of the County Council, suddenly invited the Jinan press to Licheng on the 20th in a special car. During the event, Li stated that Speaker Ren's accusations against Yue had not been made with any statement to the County Council or with the consent of the majority of councilors. The move was entirely Ren's personal opinion. County Magistrate Yue also answered each of the eight charges one by one and produced a large number of files for the reporters to review in turn. However, when the reporters were leaving Jinan for Licheng, while waiting for the bus at the Youth Association, the original complainant, Speaker Ren, also detailed Yue Bofen's illegal activities to the reporters and called for "tiger hunting," asking the press for support. This case has now attracted widespread attention in provincial circles, and the provincial government has also begun investigating. If the accusations are true, severe punishment will be imposed to establish a clean and capable new government.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Impressions of the Oil City <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Lanzhou, by airmail, 20th] Of the many cities and towns I have visited, the most exciting is the oil city built in Laojunmiao. The city gate faces north. When you arrive at the inspection station (entrance) and armed police officers ask you about your mission inside, you are facing the distant South Mountain. This oil city is nestled in the embrace of these many mountains. Slightly turning to the right, you can see the new refinery, built at the four platforms near the Oil River, with an excellent environment and location. Nearby is an oil storage yard, but it is a bit far from the production center. After entering, there is a [unclear] shaped road about one Chinese mile long, with employee residential areas on both sides and a nursery in the middle. In Laojunmiao, it takes extraordinary effort to make trees grow, and this place can be said to be the green [unclear] of Laojunmiao.</p>
<p>At the top of the U-shaped road is the general office [unclear] and the Guang塲 that created Boshan Road, opposite is a large auditorium that can accommodate 500 people. Although the construction cost is high, this place is far from the city and there are no other entertainment venues, so it is extremely needed.</p>
<p>On the left side of the U-shaped road, the road is very flat, next to the pottery 塲 (ie, brick kiln股), where fire bricks and various ceramic utensils for household use are fired for refineries and molten 欲 [unclear] furnaces. There are currently about [unclear] donkeys, used to grind and carry various stones needed for work from distant places.</p>
<p>On both sides of the auditorium are staff dormitories and reception rooms (referring to Qilian Villa). Next to the reception room, there are many brick kilns, using slag oil as fuel to burn bricks and lime.</p>
<p>Proceeding along the wide and open road, on the right is the stable (驮运股), with horses, mules, donkeys, camels, and cattle. On the left are many ordinary bungalows. Further to the left are the school and the flour mill.</p>
<p>Continuing south, on the right is the food and other supply [unclear] (ie, supply [unclear] 社), which can produce large quantities of clothing, shoes, soy sauce, tofu, and various snacks; such facilities require organization and funding. Further ahead, on the right [unclear] is the Transportation [unclear] Section, and on the left is the hospital and the electromechanical factory.</p>
<p>At the end of the two-mile-long road, you can see many mule carts, fully loaded with oil and water to supply the approximately 5,000 employees in the mine (now increased to [unclear] people). The continued use of this kind of transport [unclear] seems wasteful in modern times. [unclear] Gu [unclear] The entire oil city is covered in black smoke, and the air is polluted, making it difficult for children to stay clean. For the sake of economy and health [unclear], these shortcomings can definitely be improved when material conditions are sufficient. (Currently, [unclear] parts have been converted to natural gas as fuel, and water pipes are being laid)</p>
<p>To the right at the end, you can overlook the Oil River winding down 300 feet below the cliff into the desert plain, parallel to the main road. After arriving here, what you see further enhances our deep impression of Laojunmiao. And due to this cross-section, the structure of the strata can be seen very clearly, making geologists even more excited.</p>
<p>Walking down the bay road, you soon reach the historically significant red temple - Laojunmiao. The incense is still thriving today. Nearby, you can see the remains of the old well, the closed Well No. 5. From the pressure and oil immersion, it is estimated that it can still produce several barrels of oil per day. The old refinery is on the bank of the Oil River, capable of refining a thousand barrels of crude oil per day. The oil city, with its seven-year history, originated here. The oilfield was discovered very early on, and it was developed due to the urgent need for oil during the war. Because it is far from the city, supplies are difficult, which hindered development, but this emerging industry is [unclear] and continuing to grow.</p>
<p>Returning to the mountainside, continuing to the left will lead to the mine. Many wells on the top floor are about 2,530 meters above sea level, 200 meters higher than the other wells. Recently, mining is continuing to the east and south, because the oilfield there is more promising than here. If the equipment is sufficient, due to the energy and experience of all the employees here, this plan will definitely be achieved first. (Note: This article is an abridged version of a diary by Mr. Binnick, an English member of the Ganqing Oilfield Survey Team, after visiting Laojunmiao last year. [unclear] into.)</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Gold Control Bureau Orders Banks, Money Shops, and Trust Companies to Limit Overdrafts for Large Customers - All Similar Offset Agreements Should Be Investigated and Reported <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the recent process of inspecting banks and trust companies, the Gold Control Bureau found that the overdraft agreements signed between banks and customers were extremely large in amount. Moreover, the agreed amounts were often temporarily increased. Often, the overdraft limits set by one or two customers exceeded the total amount of their deposits, which not only violated the provisions of the Banking Law but also posed a considerable risk. For this reason, the Gold Control Bureau has ordered the Bank, Money Shop and Trust Company Association of this city to instruct its member banks and companies to absolutely limit large overdrafts or concentrated lending to a small number of customers in the future, to avoid expanding credit and stimulating prices. For those that are disguised substitutes for offsets, they should also, in accordance with the trial offset method for collection bills, prepare a report form listing each customer who has an offset agreement or a temporary overdraft agreement that is similar to an offset agreement, including the customer's name, account number, address, amount, term, and guarantor, and submit it to the bureau for verification.</p>

Apart from Meilin steadily rising to its limit and Wuhe having increased information remaining relatively stable, they were particularly weak.

The evening news reported a cessation of large overdrafts, triggering rumors of restrictions on withdrawals and falling to 11,650 yuan. Although 89 and 99 and other stocks advanced to 11,900 yuan, people's sentiment was not optimistic about the environment, and rumors were unfavorable to the multi-party side, with 143 and 154 and other stocks being sold off, falling to 11,400 yuan. Although the National Bank exchange difference came out, it recovered by 250 yuan, but was ultimately suppressed, closing at 11,450 yuan. Shanghai Cement showed a tragic decline to the limit. Wuhe had information about right increases and was relatively stable. Meilin still rose to the limit.

<p>Yesterday, tea merchants at Honglou were still wary of the high prices and remained hesitant, while sellers felt that costs were standing at a high peak and could not bear to easily sell at a loss. Therefore, the process did not escape the state of scarce buying and selling. Transactions were sparse, and the trend, which was initially stable, fluctuated again later. However, the final result at the close was that prices generally returned to level amid tight credit conditions.</p>
<p>It is learned that the Qi-Men black tea of this year, which has been in Shanghai for a long time, has been sought after by British export firms, but their bids have been stingy.

<p>Yesterday's rice market rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon. Initially, due to a slight loosening of credit, various commodities outside the industry rose, and the tin market also rose again, so market confidence was restored, and cargo owners raised asking prices. Early openings for white glutinous rice and thin rice were both at 41.2 million yuan, but later, because the market outlet remained sluggish, prices fell back. Glutinous rice and thin rice each stood at 40 million yuan, and extra-high-quality glutinous rice was at 43 million yuan, each up 3 million yuan. The market became even weaker at the close, with only a nominal increase of 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour</p>
<p>Rose sharply, because credit slightly loosened and tin prices rose. The opening was the most brisk. Under the pressure of cargo owners, Old Brand opened at 13 million yuan.

Green beans were quoted as high as 17.5 million yuan, closing at 17 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 to 1 million yuan. Corn and naked barley initially rose by 2 million yuan at the opening, but both weakened at the close.

<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Rose in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, resulting in a flat result. As soon as credit slightly loosened, cargo owners took the opportunity to raise prices. Soybean oil opened in the morning trading at 86 million yuan, but because sales were very small, it immediately weakened, returning to 80 million yuan, a slight increase of 1 million yuan. Rapeseed oil retreated to 80 million yuan, also considered flat. The opening price of Lucky Brand raw oil was already flat, so it was traded at the original price. Small truck sesame oil added 1 million yuan, and soybean cake added 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in the morning, but fell at the close, resulting in a slight decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions showed that credit conditions were inconsistent among those in the industry, and the market price was very high, so market sentiment was somewhat hesitant. The opening was still considered firm and high. The asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was once brisk at around 1.8 billion yuan, but later, because some cargo owners had tight positions, the price fell from its peak to settle at 1.7 billion yuan, on par with the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn rose and fell by turns. It is said that a total of 136 transactions were made throughout the day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were initially firm and brisk due to favorable news from the previous day. The buying power of strong investors was also strong. Because the buyers' funds had not arrived, they were all watching and waiting. The industry players on this street were all selling off at the high prices. Moreover, the Textile Construction Corporation auctioned off Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Serge. Inside the market, the initial asking price for Longtou fine cloth was 52.5 million yuan (5 million yuan outside the market). Later, because credit was not very loose, the price fell below the 50 million mark amid multiple competing sales, reaching a low of 49 million yuan. Near the close, news spread that yarn prices were rising, so short sellers covered their positions, and the market finally closed at 49.2 million yuan, an increase of 5.7 million yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Wufu Labahua children's fine cloth, etc., was also good for 5 million to 6 million yuan. Because Hankou buyers absorbed a lot of Sijunzi serge, it was also seen to rise by 6 million yuan. The market prices of other cloths also all followed higher by varying amounts of 2 million to 3 million yuan to 7 million to 8 million yuan.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Textile Construction Corporation's Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi serge, the submitted bid prices were said to be between 50 million and 51 million yuan, and the number of applicants was not weak.</p>

He has served as a professor at Sun Yat-sen University and other schools, a researcher at the Surveying Group of the China Geographical Research Institute, and the director of the Second Division of the Surveying Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. According to him, because President Li could not come to the school this time, and at a time when every move of Jiaotong University is being taken seriously, he feels his strength is insufficient to shoulder this important mission. However, he is still willing to do his best and work hard. During this period, he will do his best to urge President Li to come to the school as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Overview</p>
<p>The school was founded in the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918) on Fangxie Road in Nanshi. In the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), it purchased land on Caotang Street, Luban Road, built its own school buildings, and registered with the Ministry of Education. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, Nanshi was located in the war zone, and the school moved into the former French Concession to continue operations. After the Pacific War began, President Chen Mengyu was resented for assisting the central government in resisting Japan, and was repeatedly searched and arrested, so he could only secretly go to the mainland and serve as a member of the National Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education. The school was forced to close.</p>
<p>After the victory, President Chen immediately returned to Shanghai from Chongqing to plan the restoration of the school. Because the school buildings on Caotang Street were destroyed, Li Peitian, a member of the board of directors, allocated the old site of the former China Public School on Wenzhi Road, Jiangwan, to be used as the school. However, the site had already been set up as the No. 22 District Central Primary School, so the Municipal Education Bureau allocated a portion of the buildings of the Municipal Sports Ground to the school for use, so the school's site is the ideal environment for a sports school, where the 7th National Games were held. Currently, there is a two-year physical education major, a five-year physical education college, a scout trainer training class, and affiliated high schools and junior high schools, with a total of more than 300 male and female students. Chen Mengyu is the president of the college, Hou Jiyuan is the principal of the middle school, Jiang Xiangqing is the director of academic affairs, Yang Pinji is the director of discipline, and Hu Xidi is the director of general affairs.</p>
<p>Enrollment</p>
<p>This fall, the school will enroll 50 new students each in the two-year and five-year colleges, scout training classes, and affiliated high school and junior high school first grades. In addition, there will be 20 transfer students each for the second term of the first year of the two-year college, the second term of the first year of the five-year college, the first term of the second year, and the first term of the second year of high school and junior high school. Both men and women are accepted, and board and lodging are available. In order to cultivate physical education teachers, the Ministry of Education has ordered the education departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to select outstanding students and recommend them to the two-year and five-year physical education colleges of the school for training. Young men and women who aspire to learn physical education can apply to their respective education departments and bureaus for recommendation.</p>
<p>Registration for the school starts today. The examination period is the first time on August 1st and the second time on August 22nd. It will be held simultaneously at the school in Shanghai and at the Provincial Sports Ground in Changsha, Hunan.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Poland, Sweden, Pakistan, Palestine, and Hungary have withdrawn from the World Games football competition, so the 18 countries participating in the competition will re-draw lots on the 24th of this month to determine the competition schedule. According to the previous plan, Ireland and Holland, and Luxembourg against Afghanistan, will first play two football elimination matches. The remaining 16 countries will draw lots to determine the initial competition schedule. The World Games will hold eight preliminary football matches on the 31st of this month and August 8th. The previous plan has now been changed, so the originally scheduled China-Turkey match has also been canceled.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Oxbridge Olympic Camp, 22nd] The Chinese World Games football team, which was originally scheduled to arrive in London on the 22nd, was stranded in Calcutta due to a lack of plane seats and could not arrive as scheduled. It is expected to arrive in England on the 22nd. Other Chinese athletes, including ten basketball players, three track and field athletes, and one swimmer and one cyclist each, are practicing here every day. They will soon move from Oxbridge to dormitories near the Wembley venue. They will set up their own procurement office, managed by a Chinese procurement merchant in London, to supplement the British rationed food. The Chinese team will bring its own rice and other food.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] According to relevant sources here, Wang Zhenglin will not participate in the World Games marathon race on August 17th.

<p>[Reuters, Richmond, London, 21st] At the World Games athletes' camp in Richmond Park, the Royal Botanic Gardens, twenty students from several countries have formed a nighttime food watch team. The students carry iron bars to guard the athletes' food in the camp. In Britain, food is strictly rationed, and black market prices are extremely high, but there are no opportunities to obtain it. In the athletes' camp, all kinds of food—canned fruit, chocolate, flour, tea, etc.—are piled up like mountains. Thieves have crossed the fence and placed a ladder against the window, intending to carry out theft, but were driven away by the guarding students. The stacked food is the property of each athlete's delegation, including valuable champagne. Every day, military trucks transport food to various athletes' camps for unloading.</p>

<p>The final act of the "Tiwu Cup" Basketball Tournament, organized by the Municipal Police Bureau, took place at 6 PM last night at the YMCA gymnasium in Ba Xian Qiao. A total of two matches were held. "Mobile" and "Baobao Er" (Second Security Team) competed for the overall championship. A large cheering squad for Baobao Er came to help. Baobao Yi (First Security Team) and Huangpu exchanged yellow gift packages. There were over 600 spectators, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. In the end, "Mobile" won over Baobao Er with a score of 27 to 18, and won the championship. Baobao Er was the runner-up. In the match between Huangpu and Baobao Yi, Huangpu led the whole way, and Baobao Yi lost with a score of 31 to 38. The awards ceremony will be held on another scheduled date.</p>
<p>At 6 PM, Huangpu and Baobao Yi took the court first. Huangpu took the lead. Baobao Yi was not as strong. In the first half, Huangpu led with a score of 23 to 17. After switching sides, Baobao Yi tried to rally, but the opponents fought harder and harder, and they were unable to make a comeback. In the end, Baobao Yi lost with a score of 31 to 38.</p>
<p>The second match was the championship game between "Mobile" and Baobao Er. The soldiers of each team were equally matched. As the battle began, the tension was extraordinary, and it was difficult to tell who was better. Zhang Rongzhi, the captain of the "Mobile" team, was the most active. Ji Di of Baobao Er gave many wonderful performances. In the first half, Baobao Er took the lead with a narrow margin of seven to six, only one point ahead. After the break, the game was still a seesaw battle. The competition between the two sides became white-hot. Until the score reached 15 to 14, Baobao Er ran out of steam. "Mobile" took the opportunity to take the lead. When time ran out, "Mobile" defeated Baobao Er with a score of 27 to 18 and won the championship, with Baobao Er as runner-up.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Our athletes attending the World Games are currently residing in the World Games center area in Uxbridge. They are very unaccustomed to the "bland" British food. They find it difficult to swallow the cold vegetarian food that is the main food. Although our delegation has brought its own chefs and food such as white rice and ham, this food still needs to be negotiated before it can be transported out of the customs warehouse. For the past few days, our athletes have been eating British food, sometimes with a little white rice. White rice is already a rare delicacy here, and most of our representatives believe that this food will drastically affect their performance in the competition. The person in charge of our delegation is preparing to provide regular Chinese meals for the representatives within the next week. Our delegation began to practice slightly yesterday after arriving here for two days of sightseeing, but they felt quite tired due to the long journey and unaccustomed climate. In addition, two team members have a minor cold, but they should be cured by the time of the competition. Our track and field athletes Lou Wen'ao, Huang Liangzheng, and Chen Yinglang have been practicing hard separately. Lou Wen'ao, our country's 10,000-meter athlete with the best hope of winning, is participating in the 5,000-meter, 10,000-meter, and marathon events. As of now, Lou seems indifferent, but according to sources, he will show his special abilities on the day of the competition. According to the schedule, Lou will participate in the 10,000-meter final on the 30th of this month, the 5,000-meter final on the 31st, and the marathon on August 17th. Huang Liangzheng, our hurdles representative, will participate in the low hurdles final on July 31st. Wu Chuanyu, our 19-year-old swimming representative, practices in the Uxbridge swimming pool and the Wembley Stadium swimming pool every day, waiting for the 100-meter swimming trials.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Reader Consultation Legal Questions Joint Investment in Grain Store; Mutual Disputes over Rights and Interests <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Sheng Shihua asks: A and B jointly raised funds to open a grain store. The total capital is divided into three shares. A holds two shares and B holds one share. A is the manager. Because of family affairs, B cannot personally take care of the store. B commissions his close relative, C, to be stationed in the store to assist A in management. However, A uses C's lack of experience as an excuse to refuse B's request. Therefore, the two parties have conflicting opinions, almost to the point of turning against each other. In order to protect his own rights and interests, B insists on not giving in. Now there are several questions that I would be grateful if you could answer: (1) Because B is unable to personally take up the position due to family affairs, does he have the right to appoint another person to act as his agent? (2) Most of the store's employees are A's relatives and friends, which creates the suspicion that A is monopolizing power. Moreover, the employees recommended by B are rejected by A with excuses. In order to protect his overall benefits, what kind of countermeasures should B take to be legal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuang answers] The situation described in your letter is an event in which partners agree to contribute capital to operate a joint business. A and B have the right and responsibility to jointly execute the partnership affairs. If B is unable to execute the partnership affairs due to family affairs, A has no right to prevent B from appointing C to act as his agent. If B is only introducing C to work at the store, it is another matter whether A, as the manager, should add a store partner. If B has not executed the partnership affairs, B may still inspect the partnership affairs and its property status at any time, and may inspect the account books (see Article 675 of the Civil Code).</p>

<h3 id="e145">On Stage and Off Stage <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Recently, I returned to Nanjing from Shanghai. Although the train ticket has risen to over two million, it is only the price of one dou of rice, which is still cheaper compared to other things. Therefore, there are many passengers getting on and off at each station, and most of them no longer consider the difference between second class and third class. Poverty, on the contrary, makes people extravagant, which is also a miracle. When the train arrived in Zhenjiang, except for a portion who rushed to the Zhenjiang South Station to get on the train and found seats, those boarding in Zhenjiang could only stand in the crowd. I was sitting close to the window. Two young passengers spotted the empty seat and threw their handbags in first to reserve the seat, and then climbed in through the window. While others were crowding at the train door, they were already there, fanning themselves contentedly.</p>
<p>But they immediately lowered the iron screen on the train window. I said, "The weather is so stuffy, and there's no wind or sand. Why are you lowering it?" He answered well: "This way, they can't climb in through the window anymore!" I couldn't help but get angry: "How can you be so selfish? This is outrageous!" I immediately pulled up the screen: "Look, besides you, who else is climbing in through the window?" After all, I was a bit righteous, and the two passengers didn't dare to say anything. Several images floated into my mind, and I felt that they represented the different styles on stage and off stage.</p>
<p>China has always emphasized "being strict with oneself and lenient with others," which further reflects the problem of often seeing others' faults clearly but being blind to one's own. Moreover, because of the difference in positions, the arguments are completely different before and after, and the events before and after are completely different, which is even more common. From the standpoint of an observer, I even somewhat disliked that my seat was already occupied, so I loudly opposed them climbing through the window. Supposing I were a passenger waiting to board the train, then it would be a different thought. During the Guilin-Liuzhou Campaign, it was common to escape on the train through the windows. Each station had people who specialized in pushing passengers' butts to help them get through the windows, costing hundreds of yuan per push. For the sake of their own safety, they would not hesitate to spend these hundreds of French currency, and even fear that they would not be able to get in through the window. To those "brokers" who helped people, they were too grateful to blame them for extortion. So after I complained about my two neighbors, I couldn't help but feel a little regret, feeling that I was too lacking in forgiveness.</p>
<p>When we are on the verge of survival, we will fight, even sacrificing others is acceptable, because after all, our own lives are more important than others, which is what is meant by "forced by necessity." During wartime escapes, the strong often squeezed the weak off public transportation. It is hateful, of course, but also somewhat understandable. But if it is a time of peace and order, it can never be condoned, because this is an unreasonable expansion of selfishness. The reason why I felt uncomfortable with the two passengers closing the screen was mainly because they were too partial to themselves; they sacrificed the convenience of others for their own benefit. Then, extending from this, if they were on stage, engaged in national affairs, they would definitely be proponents of killing the chicken to get the eggs; they would not want to establish others while establishing themselves; they would not want to help others reach their goals while reaching their own; instead, they would establish themselves (abandoning the right path) and others would have to fall, they would reach their goals and others would have to suffer. This style is absolutely undesirable.</p>
<p>I used to read Han Feizi's "Saying Difficulty" and felt quite puzzled as to how the stammering Han could say these words specifically for figuring out people's hearts. It turned out that although Han Fei was not skilled in technology, he was an expert in theory. His foundation was nothing more than putting himself in someone else's shoes. But the two words "putting oneself" are really very difficult, because everyone will be blinded by their position and will not see something, just like that petty thief in "Qu You Pian" of Lu Shi Chunqiu, who dared to snatch people's gold bars in the market. When he committed the crime, others asked him, and he said, "I only saw the gold bars, I didn't see the people!" Although it is a parable, it cannot deny this truth. Don't we also have guys who add an ounce of copper to every gold bar today? There are many things that obscure people's eyes, but the bright gold bar is the easiest to take effect. I think there is always a line between the stage and off the stage, and this line is enough to obscure people's eyes, or its function may have something to do with gold bars, which is also unknown. This is an important reason why putting oneself in someone else's shoes becomes impossible, and the ancients in the song said, "The lord rides in a carriage, I wear a bamboo hat; we greet by bowing when we meet another day." On the surface, it is to not forget the old, to be polite, but in essence, it is to not be enveloped by a smoky atmosphere. This matter seems easy, but it is quite tortuous to implement. After Emperor Hui of Jin asked about the grievances of the people, there was the joke of "Why not eat minced meat if there is a famine in the world." Scholars often criticize this kind of thing, saying that he is a foolish emperor, but in fact, if I were the Jin Emperor in the deep palace, I am afraid that I would not even be able to say this kind of "joke." Look at Emperor Hui's father, didn't he just ride his sheep carriage to visit the palace women every day, having fun with his three thousand beauties? Alas!</p>

<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>The housing shortage in American cities is no less than that in Shanghai. Although renting a house has not yet reached the point of using gold bars as a premium, disguised premiums have already appeared. In the classified advertisements for housing, those future tenants often declare that they are willing to increase the rent to the landlord with physical objects or labor, such as free dental treatment for life, presenting a wireless phototelegraph machine, free singing and piano lessons for one year, presenting a set of bathroom appliances, presenting a set of interior decorations worth 500 yuan, etc., in a wide variety of ways. From the additional conditions, one can often see the tenant's occupation and cultivation.</p>

<p>Holding high the jade, still looking at the treasures on the wall, the saliva of the clouds seeks to convey the spirit, the eight directions of war gas urge cold and hunger, who is the master of the ancient world? The heights are still suspected of peeking at the chess players, the depths have already eliminated the mountain people, on the edge of the dignity today, rest and seek taste, leaving me to feel foolish and stepping into the sea.</p>

<p>For several years, the warhorses were together in pale yellow, returning from the adventure, the beard was not frost, the reputation of the Jiangjie was rampant in poetry, the world in the guest was open in the wine shop, pitying each other's chest with the atmosphere of wind and clouds, cherishing the light of the sun and moon in the world, wanting to gnaw at the teeth and still be full of mouth, not hesitating to get drunk in the field.

<h3 id="e148">A Good Publication <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Shuang Lu</p>
<p>Americans have the habit of reading, but among the books and publications, I am afraid that none is worse than the United States, and if there is, it would be only China? For example, American comic strips fly all over the streets, and their degree of obscenity, theft, and absurdity is no less than the harm suffered by children and the general public in our country. But truly excellent publications are not non-existent. The worst and the best can coexist without contradicting each other. Perhaps this is a kind of "feature" of American cultural tradition?</p>
<p>Among American high-level publications, those that are not purely academic in nature but can absorb general high-level readers, those that focus on literature and art include "The Atlantic" monthly, and those that focus on thought and contemporary history include "Harper's" magazine. Both are sister publications in the American high-level reading world, and both have a history of about 100 years since their creation. Each issue can sell tens of thousands of copies. Because ordinary American publications have to be sold to other English-speaking countries, a circulation of more than 100,000 copies is considered very pitiful. The lack of "soul mates" in knowledge is the same at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Since its creation, "Harper's" has always maintained its format similar to the sixteen-open book, but starting in July, it was changed to a larger format (similar to the "Time" magazine format). The reason is that modern printing presses are suitable for printing large sizes. In order for "Harper's" to maintain its original format, the printer requested an increase of 27 percent in printing costs. The economy of a good publication is often strained. In order to reduce costs, "Harper's" can only adapt to reality and change the version, which was not its original intention. Fortunately, the change in form is not important. As the editor of the publication said: "We changed the coat, but we did not change our character... This is still a publication for people who know how to read and intend to know how to read..."</p>
<p>The editor of the publication, F.L. Allen, is a scholar who pays attention to contemporary history, a graduate of Harvard, and once worked as an assistant editor at E. Sage 成克, the editor of "The Atlantic." He has written two contemporary histories, "Only Yesterday" and "Since Yesterday." The former sold more than 750,000 copies. He is not only a successful editor, but also a successful writer.</p>
<p>"Harper's" receives about 1,900 submissions every month, and each one is read by the editors. Among these submissions, there are often good articles. Several famous works in the publication were also unsolicited and automatically submitted. It can be seen that the publication has a high status, and famous writers will not hesitate to contribute. Not long ago, the publication published an article "Who is Loyal to America" by Columbia history professor H.S. Commager, which talked about American xenophobia. It was an unsolicited submission. As soon as the article came out, 65,000 readers wrote to request the article to be reprinted. There was also an article by former US Secretary of the Army Stimson about how the US military authorities decided to use the atomic bomb against Japan during the war. Stimson personally took the article to "Harper's." When it was published, the biggest headline was made on the cover. It can be seen that for a publication, to achieve "a forest of famous works," it cannot be achieved by editors only bowing and scraping. It must first be done so that the publication itself has authority.</p>
<p>It is unimaginable for "Harper's" readers to read 1,900 manuscripts a month, but such a publication has no more than eight main articles, but there are six full-time editors and two part-time editors to cope with this heavy manuscript reading work. This matter is also very different from our country. "Our" editors often edit two publications alone, or even four or five. How can they have the spare time to review the submitted foreign manuscripts? A simple monthly magazine uses eight editors, which is also something that our country has never had.</p>
<p>The publication also has an advantage, that is, every Tuesday, eight editors hold an editorial meeting to conduct detailed reviews of the material allocation for the next issue. Even the female trainees in the editorial department can participate and give opinions. And the editor-in-chief Allen, he himself said: "I am just a referee."</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Unbearable Old Book Market of Beiping <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>In the past years, there were many old bookstores in Beiping. Their thread-bound books were always treasured by literati and collectors. Every time a good copy was obtained, it was cherished like a precious treasure. Booksellers also knew a lot about editions and spoke eloquently, as if enumerating family treasures. Every year during the old lunar New Year, the Sea Mound opened, and books were piled up like mountains under the reed tents, and many people bought them. Today, it is very different. Thread-bound old books have become the cheapest things. There are even cases where they cannot be sold at all and are sold by the pound as waste paper. The Palace Edition Twenty-Four Histories is only priced at 40 million. There are 64 large volumes of Gu Wenzhou Jian, a meticulously printed imitation of the Ming edition on Lian Shi paper with five colors, divided into eight cloth cases, priced at only 2 million. Weighing its weight, it reaches more than ten catties, and each catty is only worth more than 100,000 yuan, which is not even as good as the price of selling old newspapers in the south. Compared with the price of pork in Ping, which is 560,000 yuan per catty, the difference is too great. A friend bought 20 copies of the Palace Museum's Xiqing Xu Jian printed on Lian Shi paper, with a porcelain green paper cover and silk thread meticulously bound, stored in two cloth cases, priced at only 1 million, and each copy was only worth 50,000. The bookseller said that it was only selling the price of silk thread, which is true. There are not many old bookstores in Liulichang anymore. In addition, there are several in Longfusi Street and four or five in Xidan Street. They are all deserted and selling cheaply. According to this trend, in the future, they will all inevitably be sold as waste paper, and it is possible to see Song, Yuan, and Ming editions in the wrapping paper of sesame cakes, peanuts, and other snacks. As for the Southern Paper Shops, except for Rongbaozhai and Qingmigou, which still retain their old style, the rest have all changed their quality and also sell other things. The decline of their main business can be imagined.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Golden Age of Peking University <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Da Peng</p>
<p>Lord Ling Xiaohan of the Han Pavilion repeatedly spoke of Peking University alumni during his talks, but all he mentioned were those from before the fifth year of the Republic (1916), and the alumni from the era of the Imperial University of Peking. It seems that Lord Pavilion had already left Peking University by the period from the fifth to the eighth year of the Republic (1916-1919), so he did not mention the alumni of this era. In fact, Peking University produced talented individuals in great numbers, and this period was its golden age. With over three thousand students, it was known as the highest institution of learning in the country. President Cai Yuanpei broadly recruited and included individuals of diverse views. Among the professors were Lin Qinnan and Gu Tangsheng, who held extremely outdated ideas, and Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi, who were extremely modern. The student body was also extremely diverse, including supporters of the monarchy, members of the Kuomintang, communists, members of the Anfu Clique, members of the Research Clique, military men (a classmate surnamed Tong, who once served as a brigade commander under Wu Peifu), remnants of the Qing Dynasty, and a variety of other types. However, because the entrance examinations were extremely strict (the first test included Chinese, a foreign language, and mathematics, and each subject required a score of sixty or above. If one scored one hundred in Chinese but fifty-nine in mathematics, they would be rejected and not allowed to participate in the second test), although the composition of the student body was diverse, there was no padding of the ranks with unqualified individuals. In the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), after the success of the Northern Expedition, Peking University alumni holding positions in the central government and in various provinces and cities accounted for more than five out of ten. It is remembered that when He Jingzhi was in charge of Zhejiang's administration, the head of the Civil Affairs Department was Peking University professor Ma Yichu (Xu Lun), and forty-six of the seventy-five county magistrates in Zhejiang Province were Peking University alumni. Although their numbers gradually decreased thereafter, the number of Peking University alumni distributed throughout various national institutions was still considerable. In the eighth year of the Republic (1919), Fu Sinian, Luo Jialun, Duan Xipeng, and two others, who were sent abroad with funding from the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, were all Peking University alumni. At the time, they were known as the "Five Ministers Going Abroad." All five of these individuals have already gained fame in their time, so there is no need to elaborate. Others, such as the recently specially appointed Minister of Examinations, Tian Jiongjin (Yunqing), was also a Peking University alumnus who graduated in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924). Deputy Minister Shen Shiyuan was a Peking University professor and concurrently the Director of the Office of Academic Affairs. When Tian was studying at Peking University, Shen was still working at the school. The fact that they were once teacher and student and are now colleagues is also a good story. Furthermore, Deng Feihuang, the recently appointed Civil Affairs Director of Hunan Province (graduated from the Department of Economics in the thirteenth year of the Republic), is also a Peking University alumnus.</p>
<p>Also, there is Liu Hangchen, a wealthy man from Sichuan; Yuan Guanxin (original name Shibin), the Civil Affairs Director of Guizhou; Fu Rulin (Mubo), who once served as the Deputy Minister of the Interior and Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and is currently the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Industrial Bank; Zhong Tianxin (original name Ruzhong), a member of the Legislative Yuan who once served as the Director of Education of Zhejiang and is currently the General Manager of Zhengzhong Book Company; Di Ying, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee; Hu Ruoyu, the former mayor of Qingdao; Jiang Zhicheng, the former mayor of Chongqing; Wang Kunlun (original name Ruxing, currently under orders to go to the United States for observation), a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and Legislative Yuan; Ye Fenghu, a Shanghai city councilor (who once served as the county magistrate of Hangzhou); and Zhou Yizhi, who served as a member of the Legislative Yuan for twenty years and is now practicing law in Shanghai, are all alumni who graduated in the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic (1923-1924). Furthermore, it must be noted that Mao Zedong also audited classes at Peking University in the ninth year of the Republic (1920) and worked part-time in the Peking University Library (introduced by Li Dazhao, who was then a professor at Peking University and was executed in Beijing by Zhang Zuolin in the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925) on the charge of being a communist. Among those executed at the same time were eleven people, including Zhang Yiguan, a female student at Peking University). His monthly salary was only thirty-five yuan. The above are only those known to me, and they are all Peking University alumni who studied before and after the May Fourth Movement. Peking University classmates had relatively little interaction with each other while at school, and omissions are inevitable.</p>
