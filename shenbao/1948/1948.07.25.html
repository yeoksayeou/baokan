<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕第一屆立法院第一會期廿四日宣吿終結，自廿五日起開始休會。第一會期之末次會第廿二次會議，廿四日全日處理要案多起後，於掌聲由散會。孫院長並於散會前簡單致詞，檢討本會期工作，略謂：行憲伊始，而立院規模龐大，同人及職員皆無經騐，故最初多有手忙脚亂之感，待後各委會正式成立，展開審査提案工作，院務乃得走上常軌，至堪欣慰。而預算委會兩旬來處理總預算案之效率及成績，尤足同人稱道欽佩。渠旋報吿對立院辦公及立委居住之設施進行情形，並期於半年內使此等問題得次第解決。末稱：渠得追隨同人展開此一行憲之新局面，殊感興奪，唯盼國家局勢日漸好轉，則立院之成績必更可觀。廿四日立院會中並通過臨時動議，議定下一會期將依憲法規定，自九月開始，於九一重行集會，而不予延遲。至休會期間各委會工作，則田留京委員主持，照常進行，待理各案包括總預算案之待決部份，仍將繼續加以審査。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立院通過之卅七年下半年度國家總預算案之審議總報吿，正由預算委會趕速整理中，可望於廿六日由該院咨復政院。總預算之公布，將由政院決定後爲之。立院廿四日會中並通過程序委會之臨時動議，凡經剔除預算決予撤消之各政府機關如全經會。花管會·燃管會·工商輔導處等之組織法或組織條例及有關法規，將於爵家總預算案審議總報吿咨復政院時，併請即行宣吿廢止。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立法院第一會期第廿二次會議廿四日舉行，孫科主席，九時半開會，首進行報吿事項，通過第廿次及第廿一次會議議事錄後，當決議將行政院咨送審議之法案三件分別交付審査，計：（一）財政部國稅署組織法草案及財部所屬各區國稅管理局，國稅稽徵局，直轄直接稅局，直轄貨物稅局等組織條例草案案，（二）總統府國策顧問委員會及戰略顧問委員會組織條例草案案，（三）國防部紐織法草案案。旋孫院長報吿該院法制委會擬定之立監委歲費·公費給暫行條例業經廿三日之秘密會議通過，已飭秘書處據以編列預算。十時正開始進行討論事項，第一案法制委會報吿審査司法行政部調査局組織條例草案案，第二案，沈重宇等一六九人就前案提出修正意見，主調查局應隸內政部案，兩案合併討論，由法制委會召集委員張金鑑及修正案提案人沈重宇分別說明後，即展開激辯。贊成原案者謂，成立保衛國家社會安全置於司法系統中爲開明進步之舉且多强調該局今後應發揮其法律性及技術性，僅有調査權而無行動權。反對原案者則以爲，中國是類機構够多，然共匪依舊猖獗，是其成效可疑，尤其司法系統應公開秉正，立院不能率爾使之混消，致生惡果，其中若干委員主張原案保留，多數則表示如爲政治原因可予妥協，唯決不能使隸司法行政部。辯論一小時餘，休息後進行表決，先以主張原案保留之意見付表決，在塲委員二四三人，贊成者一一二人，反對原案之委員乃要求反表決，反表決之結果，爲在塲委員二四七人，贊成者一三四人，主張保留之意見仍遭否決，唯反對原案之各委員仍表不服，對人數計算提出問題，主再舉行複表決，反對反對原案者則以爲如此表決不合法，同時亦有主張分坐進行表決者，亦有主張投票表決者，一時全塲秩序鬨然大亂。江一平氏乃於此際提出程序問題，認爲對原案共有保留，修改與維持三種意見，依法應次第付表決，而不應於一種意見有少數人一再堅持時，影響會議之進行，孫院長亦氣憤怒呼：「請大家注意秩序，你們有自己的席次不坐，偏散坐在後排，倒說人數不對，你們都好好坐到前面來再表決」。各委員乃紛紛回歸原位，於緊張之空氣中再次淸算人數，重行將三種意見次第付表決，結果在塲委員三一四人，贊成原案保留者爲一一三人，而贊成沈重宇等修正案者則達一七〇人，於是通過決議，將調査局改隸內政部，原案及修正案併交法制委會，會同內政及地方自治委會重行審査，修訂組織條例草案，一塲風波乃吿平息，十二時許乃宣吿散食。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕翁院長文潛今晚在中央廣播電台向國內外廣播，全文如次。</p>
<p>此次談話，注重說明在此戡亂時期全國團結一致，加緊動員的必要。要知吾國大局的形勢，必須先明世界國際情形：第二次世界大戰是許多國家聯合起來打敗積極對外侵略的德國及日本。吾國全體一致，精誠抗戰了八全年方能取得勝利，收復五十年來的失土。方謂大戰吿終，和平實現，可以進入認眞建設，達到康樂安全的時代；不幸世界形勢爲共產黨所擾亂，他們名爲政黨，實則充份利用罷學。罷工等風潮，舉行暴動，且使用武力，以摧殘破壞人民的資產與國家的完整。這種的行動，決不是政黨應有的，實在是對於政黨秩序及依法組織的叛亂行爲。很明顯的，各國共黨具有一貫的目標，與聯合的動作，他們互相呼應，以打擊眞正的民主政治，破壞人民的天賦自由，所以我們爲維護國家及人民起見，必須同德一心，精誠團結，把全國的力量集合起來，以担負我們戡亂救國的神聖任務。</p>
<p>誠意實行憲政　發揮前進精神</p>
<p>在此同一時期中，吾國很誠意的實行憲政，所謂憲政，就是將以前國民黨訓政時代正式結束，將政權交還人民，由人民選舉產生國民大會，制定憲法，並根據民意，組成五權政府，行施憲政。這正是證明中國政治已眞實的走上民主的道路，爲人民的利益而工作。在此實行憲政之初，要負担戡亂責任，首先要自爲發揮動員前進的精神，這種精神，在立法院審査預算案中曾有充分表現，審査要旨，分爲兩項，一是增加收入及節省開支，二是儘量裁减駢枝機關與冗濫人員。在此眼光之下，及非與剿匪軍事及急要之經濟生產有關者，各項支出均應認眞緊縮或悉爲剔除，這正充分證明行憲與戡亂兩種工作，確可同時實行，相輔相成，更加實際的功效。</p>
<p>機構化繁為簡　集中人力物力</p>
<p>在實行方面，對於上述方針，自應切實執行；目前已經實行的，如財政部將直接稅署與貨物稅機關合併爲一，改組為國稅署，化繁為間，减少非必需的人員，節省過份的開支，實具有緊縮支出及增高效率的意義。此外，立法院凝決應栽的機關，行政院方面自必依照實行，並且照同一方向，更籌其他加强進行的方法。另一方面，我們要提高戡亂的力量，必須能用全國的物力與人力，物力範圍內，糧食更關重要。自古以來，吾國確信足食足兵爲立國的根本條件，爲足食起見，政府決定實施糧食征實征借辦法。此次立法院議決案，並提明應提高征實征收成數，减少價購數量，可見立法行政兩院都認識實行此種辦法的必要，鄭重提出，認眞實施。實際上，如此實行，人民負担自不免比較加重，但吾國田賦自淸初以來，沿用至今，物價加高甚多，賦率並未加重，在此戡亂時期，全國同胞對於前方士兵浴血作戰，踴躍輸將，熱誠扶助，實應萬衆一心，共同貢獻。因此極望各級負責執行的機關及人員，亦明識輸粟收糧爲此時重大天職，振起精神，如數征集，切勿虧欠數額，或藉詞規避。</p>
<p>停減通貨膨脹　實為當務之急</p>
<p>目前物價的高漲，原因雖有多端，但重要的理由，皆因通貨膨脹，通貨膨脹的原因，實爲政府開支太大，所以如何開源節流，大量停减通貨的膨脹，實爲今天最關重要的急務。如何達此目的，中央政府正在籌劃辦法，期能認眞實行。但此種必要，尙須各機關各方面共爲深切瞭解，同心進行，方能成功。這是我們喚起大家注意的一個要點。其次，要想說明的，是在此戡亂時期，極須社會秩序能够保持，經濟狀况能够安定；我們的友邦美國人民及政府，歷來對於吾國艱苦極表同情，此時又撥定款項，贈送物資，協助建設，自於吾國大局極有裨益。但吾國應知，美援效益之高低，首視吾國能否自助，吾國確能自助，則因美援而效果更爲加强。吾國如不能自助，則力因分而减弱，物因亂而失效，雖有美援，其實效自不易盡如所期，因此，我們必須深切樹立積極前進的決心，以前的錯誤，竭誠改正，未完備的地方，趕緊補充盡最高的努力，以提高我們工作的功效。試將戡亂時期與抗戰時期的心理互相比較，戡亂關係的重大，決不下於抗戰，但社會心理的團結與緊張，則反不能及。因此甚盼全國同胞，共同明瞭共匪行動實有動搖國本的危險，今日實為中國固有文化及正常組織的存亡危急之時，大家一體相連，禍福與共，必須加緊動員，認眞前進方能扶持國運與安定民生。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立院發言人廿四日談稱：「立院此次審査本年下半年度國家總預算案，歲入部份照行政院原列之數字計核，實增加達二百六十餘萬億元，（本可增加三百十餘萬億，因鹽稅不加，故少增五十餘萬億）。此種增加之數額，並非由於稅率之提高，而大多係將原列各國營事業及各項稅收之收入數字核實增加，即如原列數字太少，審査時則照實際情形予以核增，且此種核增之數額，均邀請各主管機關負責人共同商討後，始予確定，故甚確實可靠。」此外對各機關之駢枝機關與冗員均儘量栽减，與軍事無關之事業或工程經費可以緩辦者，亦概加剔除，以符節流之旨。然對前方作戰兵士，則決定由國防部按每人以戰前一元基數發給「作戰加給」，以示優遇。</p>

<p>立監委歲公費標準不高</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立法院發言主人，廿四日就立·監委員支給歲費，公費標準問題，奉命發表書面談話稱：「此次立·監委員歲費·公費，曾參照美·英·法·比·澳·義·日·加·瑞各國議員俸給及旅費支給之例面予以決定者，且遠較各國議員所支之標準爲低，至於交通費三十元，房屋補助費四十元，原爲院方辦公費之一部份，如能由院方供給各委員居住之招待所及交通車輛，則此兩項費用即不發給。現有立委住在旅館，而由院方付旅館費者，即未發房屋補助費四十元可爲一例」。渠並續謂：「外間認爲立·監委員歲費標準過高，余頗不以爲然，余並非爲立·監委員辯護，實因立。監委員所得之歲費，公費猶不及銀行中助理員之所得爲多，不過一般公務員待遇過低，遂顯得立·監委員待遇過高，此種看法似應改正，蓋一般公務人員待遇太低，絕非合理現象，早爲盡人皆知，亟應作合理之調整，方爲正理，故立委簡黨三，金紹先等早即提議應改善公數人員待遇，陳明仙等亦提議改善縣級公教人員待遇，甚盼一論界督率政府，使早日見諸事寬，則公教人員可心工作，必能增進行政效能」。</p>

<h3 id="c21">自治通則草案之批判 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 童行白</p>
<p>自中央行憲以來，全國各地，民主思潮，自由觀念，蓬勃而起。中央旣已實施憲政，則地方之自治，自須迅速完成，此爲順理成章之事，自無遲迴審顧之餘地。因是上海市參議會特組織自治法規硏究委員會，搜集資料，硏究辦法，俾上海地方自治工作，得以順利展開。開會以來，集議多次，覺目前主要關鍵，在於中央自治通則，尙在內政部起草立法院審議之階段，必待通則頒佈，然後各地方始能依據通則起草自治法草案。然中央對此項通則，萬一規定過細，限制過嚴，使地方無自由伸縮之餘地，必致削足適屨，決難適合地方實際之需求。茲就行白管見所及，擇其關係較大者數點，析論於後，以爲研討之綱要，並供立法院之參考也。</p>
<p>第一，法例之解釋。省縣地方自治，憲法有明文規定：「省得召集省民代表大會，依據省縣自治通則，制定省自治法，……（第一百十二條）「縣得召集縣民代表大會，依據省縣自治通則，制定縣自治法……（第一百二十二條）「市（省轄市）準用縣之規定」。（第一百廿八條）可知省系統內之省市縣三級地方自治，憲法已規定甚明，但最宜首先自治之直轄市，其自治地位如何？中央反似視爲次要。按憲法中僅於一百十八條規定云：「直轄市之自治，以法律定之。」其所謂法律，究何所指？則憲法於一百七十條指明云：「本憲法所稱之法律，謂經立法院通過，總統公布之法律」。依據上項法例，匯合觀察，本屬意義甚明；蓋直轄市之自治，雖未指出依據直轄市自治通則，但直轄市亦應有自治通則以爲自治法之依據，義實顯然。因自治通則必須經立法院通過，大總統公布者，卽所謂法律也。自治通則旣爲法律，則與憲法一百十八條云：「直轄市之自治以法律定之」適相符合，了無可疑。不意行政院於最近通過送交立法院之省縣自治通則草案，第八章附則，第三十一條云：「依憲法第一一八條規定，直轄市之自治以法律定之，但得參酌本通則，擬訂各該市之自治法，遞呈政院轉立院制定之』，顯屬誤解憲法「直轄市之自治以法律定之」一語，爲直轄市之自治，須由立法院制定，故有遞呈政院轉立院制定之規定。且立院自覺因自治法而由中央制定，顯屬剝奪地方之立法權，乃作調和辦法，先由地方擬訂，再由政院轉立院制定，以爲如此可兩方顧全。不知此一法例，苟得成立，無異使中國憲政史上留下一極大之汚點，使中國民主政治，受一嚴重之創傷，於法於理，絕不可通！夫普通縣市人民，尙可自定其自治法，保有其地方立法權，何以直轄市人民，反不能自定其自治法，反喪失其地方立法權，豈中央認爲普通縣市之人民，其工商發達之情况，文化敎育之水準，反優於直轄市耶？抑中央對於民權實施，尙有差別待遇耶？若然，將何以自解於憲法第七條：「中華民國人民在法律上一律平等」之原則？其爲有恃於憲法之眞義，甚屬顯然。况旣許地方自治，則中央祗可依照憲法制定一自治通則，頒發地方，俾可依此以制定地方自治法，決無一面許其自治，一面又奪其自治之立法權。試問自治立法權而由中央行使，尙得稱謂地方自治耶？地方不能自治，中央所行者，尙得稱爲憲政耶？揆之世界各國民權發展之實例，地方自治，莫不由城市而發展至鄉邑，蓋城市因經濟。文化·交通之發達，工商組織與社交往來之繁復，公共事務之推進，其需要自由自治之觀念，自較鄉邑爲濃厚而深切。今反本末倒置，輕重易位，寬令明識之士百思而不得其解！</p>
<p>第二，實施之程序。地方自治之實施程序，在建國大綱，本有明白規定。若照此項程序嚴格辦理，則中央此次不能召集國民大會，不能議定憲法，不能選舉總統，換言之，即不能即時行憲也。蓋建國大而所定之程序，行憲乃爲由下而上，非由上而下者；首先必須實行縣自治，俟全省有過半數之縣已達自治時，然後實行省自治；俟全國過半數之省已至完全自治時，然後召集國民大會，制定憲法，選舉總統，而憲政於焉吿成。今中央不待縣自治，省自治之完成，而即行召集國民大會，制定憲法，選舉總統者，蓋以國內政治上有特殊關係，政黨間有特殊約定，故不惜先行結束訓政，開始憲政。程序問題，現已麼棄於前，自不應再提於後，否則中央將何以自解於不依程序而行憲耶？然此次行政院最近通過送交立院之省縣自治通則草案，第二章忽又規定實施程序，其第六條云：「凡一縣完成左列事項時，即實施縣自治：（一）警衛辦理完善，（二）財政整理完竣，（三）戶籍登記辦理完竣，（四）地籍整理完成」，真是奇文！所謂完竣·完成·完善者，姑無論目前全國數千縣無一能合此標準，即以上海而論，誰敢云上海之警衛·財政·戶籍·地籍已至完竣·完成·完善之境地，絲毫無憾，而有資格可實施自治者？且此項標準，尙須經蓋督機關負責考核，考核之結果，上級機關更有隨意伸縮，自由准駁之餘地，欲望全國各地均能實施地方自治，正如河淸之不可俟，是無異中央之忌視地方自治也而已！論者謂中央開放地方民權，竟如解放奴隸然，老大不放心。豈中央自己可以不要程序，而對於地方則非程序不可耶？且國父所定行憲程序爲由下而上，今中央一變而爲由上而下，豈國父遺敎亦有修正之必要耶？數十年來，中國狃於中央集權之惡習，凡事總由中央一把抓住，雖爲純粹地方事務，中央亦控制惟恐不緊，以致流弊所及，地方政府盡變爲中央之附屬機關，權小無能，其不能自由發展，有所建樹，蓋亦勢所必然者矣。更以民權之不予澈底開放，致人民之於政治，亦淡焉漠不相關，野心之徒，乃乘隙抵駁，在地方播散邪說，任意活動，一夫夜呼，亂者四起，可知强幹弱枝之辦法，宜於古者，未必宜於今也。世決無人民向心之力盡失，而可以立國者；即云均權之治，亦以迅速開放民權，完成自治為主要原則。蓋自治則民力易集，官治則民心易散，人民心力之集散，影響於國家治亂與寂者甚大。深望中央放遠眼光，擴大襟抱，取消此項程序之限制，俾地方咸能迅速自治，以牧牡丹綠葉之助也。</p>
<p>第三，監督之權限。辦理地方自治，當然須有上級監警機關，吾人極無間言。惟監督機關之職權，應以輔導爲原則，不應操地方自治的最後決定之權，否則仍爲官治而非民治矣，仍爲中央集權，而非地方均權矣。行政院通過之省縣自治通則草案第十三條云：「省縣辦理地方自治事項，不得違背中央政策及法令」。査憲法祗規定不得與憲法抵觸，不得與法律抵觸，並未言上級機關之命令，亦不得抵觸也。誠以憲法爲國大所通過，法律爲立法院所通過者，其不得抵觸，自在情理之中，至命令均不經民意機關通過者，亦不得抵觸，則地方自治政府，無異一中央之附屬機關，倚何自治意義之可言？又査內政部自治通則甲案第六十一條云：「各級自治監督機關，得爲左列各款之處置：（一）審核預算決算，工作計畫，工作報吿，及有關人民權利義務之單行規章。（四）對於自治中心工作，得代決定，必要時得代執行。」據原案說明，謂內政部在二十一年第二次內政會議所提地方自治改革方案，亦有此主張，故本案特爲規定云云。不知彼時尙在訓政時期，各地方並無省縣議會之設立，上級機關代爲審核，代爲執行，原無不可，今當行憲時期。各級民選議會，均將設立，上級監督機關，如何尙可越俎代庖？况前項權限，純屬於地方議會之權限，若上級監督機關可以代行，則省縣議會可以不要矣！又如內政部所擬直轄市自治通則草案第十八條第三項：：市政府之組織，依其事務繁簡，及財政情形，由各市市政府訂定，提請市議會議決，送請自治監督機關核准備案。」所謂核准者上級監督機關，顯保有最後決定之權，儘管市政府訂定，儘管市議會議決，只要上級機關一聲不准，即全部推翻；其爲限制民權，妨礙自治，異常顯明，可知中央集權之遺毒，至今仍隱藏於行憲法案草案之內，可慨孰甚！（下文轉入第五版）</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕受命組閣之激進社會黨馬利廿四日向國民議會懇切呼籲，批准渠之組織新內閣。渠向議會發表之政網，以外交政策爲主，指出法國之外交政策，應以堅定而不從事挑戰爲原則。觀察家相信馬利之特別注重外交，而將內政問題置於次要地位，乃係一種故意的行動，俾國會易於批准渠之組織。</p>
<p>馬利稱，「法國在歐洲的地位，應爲時時注意不可從事過份的挑撥，但同時亦應保持堅定的立塲。本人如出任新內閣之首長，將實行堅定而不從事挑撥的外交政策。法國的對德政策，應以倫敦六國會議決議爲據，法國願意德國重新取得其在歐洲的正當地位，但不能因此犧牲其他歐洲國家的利益。本人認爲應乘下屆聯大會於九月間在巴黎舉行的機會，充分解決德國問題。關於英法關係，本人認爲法國必須與英携手前進，因此本人無條件擁護英法五十年同盟條約，並主張以對英樹立友好關係為我主要原則」。</p>

<p>— 蔡全聲譯</p>
<p>蘇聯缺乏一個運河系統，像西歐那樣的有巨大容量的運輸航路。它沒有內地河道，只有少數的大河，但每年大部份時間是凍結的。因此，蘇聯國內的運輸，百分之八十三是依靠鐵路。但即使在它的工業地區，鐵路系統也非常不完全。它的鐵路長度僅及七十六年美國（在一八七二年）的長度，但却必須爲着三倍大的領土服務。蘇聯全國的鐵路總計祗有五萬七千哩，而今日的美國却有廿二萬六千哩。鐵路運輸是蘇聯經濟的第一個關鍵，它將在未來幾年中，使蘇聯的進展受到阻滯。</p>
<p>即使在新五年計劃之下，蘇聯也祇建築鐵路四千五百哩。原因是它在戰前的鐵路網，集中於西部，該地區曾淪入納粹之手，破壞甚重，必須首先加以重建。蘇聯正被迫恢復大多數的鐵路設備。許多舊的火車頭正在使用，各種車輛係沒收德國及其附庸國的。</p>
<p>我們研究蘇聯的汽車工業，便可以更多的了解蘇聯，像其他工業一樣，蘇聯的汽車工業是國營的及政治統制的，並不生產任何基本的汽車。它是模倣英美的車輛，大體上沒有什麼應改變。即使如此，蘇聯的汽車工業並不發達。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於人力的運用，吿訴我們以許多關於它發動戰爭的可能性。莫斯科有一家雜誌「經濟問題」比較著蘇聯的電力廠與美國南部的一家電力廠，這兩家工廠產量是同樣的，但美國只用五十一人，而蘇聯則須四百八十人。美國動力廠只有十七個職員，而蘇聯的電力站却須九十一人。在共產主義經濟制度之下，生產一千基羅瓦特的電力，蘇聯需要十一人工作，但在美國，只要二人就够了。</p>
<p>煤產方面的情形也同樣明顯。在美國，所有的煤礦，已有百分之九十用機器加以開發，百分之六十是機器運輸，只有百分之四是剷除的。但在蘇聯，大量的煤都是用手挖掘的。</p>
<p>蘇聯的煤礦，像其他蘇聯工業一樣，充滿着非生產者。最近訪問蘇聯頓巴茲煤區的瑞典礦業工程師發現，四個奴隸工人在挖掘煤礦時，便有一個蘇聯的工程師，管理者，技術家或政治管理員在旁邊監督。蘇聯人民用以壓迫勞動者，其數目亦許比他國工人的數目還要多。但在共產主義經濟中，奴隷勞工的生產率，是比不上自由經濟的自由工人的。</p>

<p>市總工會爲此次指數糾紛問題，特於昨日上午十時，舉行常務理事會議。水祥震主席，首就自生活指數改爲每月公佈二次，評斷會復訂定發薪準則後引起之勞資爭議有所報吿，復針對本案現實問題闡明主張及理由，當即開始討論。席間各人發當熱烈，綜合重要決議數項如下：（一）指數問題，決再呈請當局以當期指數計薪爲原則。（二）推全體常務理事，於下週一（廿六日）晨趨謁吳局長請願，務請採納施行，並促使早日實現，以維工人生活。</p>
<p>總工會理事長述理由</p>
<p>〔又訊〕總工會昨日通過要求政府按照當期指數計薪後，該會理事長水祥雲向記者闡述理由，略謂總工會前根據各業工會報吿，成以近來物價狂漲，指數與物價脫節，如以上月指數計薪，工人吃虧太大，難以維持生活，故由本會決定標本兼治辦法多項，呈請政府採納施行。治本方而，重行家計調査。治標方面，每週二五調査物價一次，每月公佈指數二次等。現各項提議，均蒙政府核准施行，深感當局愛護勞工，然總工會之所以有要求每月公佈二次指數之提議，亦皆在使全市工友，每月工資有二次發給，且可享受當期指數計薪之權利，例如五月份工人指數爲三三·七萬倍，六月份爲七一萬倍，本月上半月爲一三八萬倍，每期指數之劇增，輒達一倍，故如仍以上期指數計薪，工資與物價相距過遠，一大對每月二次指數之公佈，非唯未獲益，更反蒙受損害，且與本會要求及政府兩期公佈生活指數之初衷相逆。</p>
<p>希望資方　勉力支持</p>
<p>自本期指數公布後，爲計薪爭議，迭起糾紛，雖有評斷會決定準則辦法，然終以物價一日數跳，影饗工人生活，即以各業如有協議，從其協議習慣而首，亦可謂已失時効，現實如此，工人迫於生計，終不能仍從協議或習慣，而不顧現實生活。本會站於勞工立塲，不得不有此表示，明知各業資方負担亦鉅，但事非得已，深盼資方體念時艱，勉力支持，共渡難關云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市偉達飯店主人陳偉達姦淫生女陳邦倩一案，自變方在警察總局和解，陳女撤回吿訴後，陳偉達忽吿悔約，先後向地政局及地方法院具狀聲請撤銷贈與其女之房產十棟。遭駁斥後，陳又向南京有關當局控吿警察局長兪叔平等脅迫簽訂和解筆據，經本市地檢處一度偵訊，以罪證不足，不予受理。陳復親向監察院于院長控訴，現該案奉命移轉吳縣地檢處再度偵査中。案中女主角陳邦倩因最近風聞其父聲言將對其有所不利，乃於昨日下午偕其異母兄陳尙文，在都城飯店招待各報記者，歷述設父凌辱之經過。陳女現年二十九歲，昨衣黑綢旗袍，侃侃而談，毫無羞態。渠堅稱確係陳偉達之親生女兒，其母爲陳之第二妾，住於復興中路一七〇弄十三號。</p>
<p>薄暮車中　橫遭凌辱</p>
<p>女第一次被父强姦，時尙僅十六歲，其時就讀於啓明女中，該校校規甚嚴，平時學生如有事外出，必須家長親自來領始可離校。某日爲聖震前數日，傍晚放學後，陳偉達忽自駕汽車來迎其歸家，女欣然登車，初不料其父意心　叵測也。上車之後，陳僞稱有事赴徐家匯一行，女不疑有他，任其駕車前往。無何暮色四合，陳駛至貝當路附近，即停置於一僻靜之小道中。時天寒歲暮，路無行人，黑暗中陳偉達遂露其禽獸面目。女伶仃弱質，且因陳腰間佩有手槍，無法抗拒，在其威嚇蜜誘之下，乃於汽車中慘遭生父蹂躪而喪失童貞矣，旋陳送之歸家，女母時正患病在牀，女隱忍不敢啓口，此後力避與陳見面，並一度寄居於姨母家中。據女所述，此後進東吳大學選讀法律，十三年來與其父發生性的關係僅在汽車中之一次而已。惟在上海淪陷日人進入租界之時，某日陳又藉故使女至偉達坊某號一行，至則該處爲一空屋，陳已先在等候，見女又加以輕薄，惟並未姦淫，僅表示此後決不再糾纏。</p>
<p>報吿受辱經過時之陳邦情　（本報攝）</p>
<p>視同禁臠　不許了嫁</p>
<p>如此至去年四月間，女結識一沈姓男友，雙方有嫁娶之意，並擬立即至外埠結婚，女吿於陳，孰料陳竟將其視作禁臠，堅不允其出嫁，並斷絕彼等之生活費用。至此女乃將父强姦之事向家人說明，並鬱鬱成病。爲女之婚事，女母與陳時起口角，並屢遭毆打，至四月二十一日夜半。陳來後，又將女母毆辱。該處房屋係一樓一底，平時女睡於樓下，陳與女母則居樓上。此夜陳竟驅令女母下樓，而欲女與其同榻。因不從命，陳將兩人反鎖於房內後而去。至次日夜半又來，並將電燈關熄，欲行非禮。女逃至晒台，忍無可忍，遂越牆至隔壁人家逃出後，向嵩山分局吿發。次日由分局轉解總局辦理。總局根據陳女所述，傳陳偉達至局中偵詢。</p>
<p>祖母懇求　和解立據</p>
<p>此時女之七十餘齡祖母（即陳偉達之母）及異母兄陳尙文聞訊，趕來警局，以家醜不宜外揚，懇切勸女撤回吿訴，同時陳亦表示悔過之意，求女恕其以往，在此種情形之下，女情爲所動，不得已而應允和解。當時由陳偉達口述，其子尙文執筆，寫悔過書一紙，對於過去行爲表示悔過，並成立和解筆據，願將復興中路一七〇弄五號至十四號之房屋十幢贈與女方，另給一千萬元以補生活之不足。不料此案解決後，女等僅於五月七日接到陳之雙掛號信附支票給予女母八十萬元，女三十萬元，作爲生活費用，此後即分文未給。至十二月中，陳更向地政局聲請制止女母接管十幢房屋之所有權狀。地政局以彼等係夫婦關係，囑循法律途徑解決。</p>
<p>控拆駁回　揚言威嚇</p>
<p>陳繼忽以和解字據係受脅迫簽署爲由，向地院起訴，開庭時女呈閱陳寄來生活費之信函，庭上以陳旣會寄與生活費一次，無異承認筆據有效，乃予駁回。此後陳即向南京方面控訴警察局長兪叔平矣。及至最近，陳偉達又對其子尙文聲稱，將以激烈手段對付邦倩，尙文係陳偉達嫡配所出，與女雖屬異每兄妹，但素不直其父之行爲，且同倩其妹遭遇，乃將此言總吿，女恐有生命危險，大爲恐慌，乃有昨日拋頭露面之警焉。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕天潼路二四二弄八號樓上，於前月十四日，发生一離奇之謀殺案，死者係浙江定海老婦包趙氏，五十六歲，陳屍於床幔後地板上，頸間除有褲帶一条限入肉內甚深外，頸部復爲棕棚套層层包没，且用粗繩紮住，手上所帶金鐲兩隻及金戒七隻，計重六兩之飾物，均被捋去，室內除靠窗一大樹下之玻璃擊碎一方及門旁桌下一熱水瓶倒碎外，餘無損失。出事時死者室內，窗幔拉攏，樓上下七家住户，亦未見有陌生人出入，雖經警局派員至現塲査勘，並將該屋內同住者帶局偵訊，亦無端倪，現死者家屬以此謀財害命案，自各種跡象言，似爲熟悉屋內情形者所爲，但事隔二月，警局仍未能緝獲凶犯，死者賚寃而沒，生者其何以堪？故盼警局加緊査緝，俾雪沉寃。死者之夫供職於廣東路駿大華行，兩子分在電料行及報關行工作，一妹已出嫁。五月十四日上午家中人均已外出，包趙氏於九時許至吳淞路買菜，並領取户口糖，至十時許返家，以領得之户口糖甚爲潔白，乃先携赴前廂房住户薛瑞財處互作談論，旋即返出，當渠將菜籃置放於自己臥室門外之桌上，探鑰開門入內後，詎房門立即發一砰然巨響，關上時薛某曾令其妹至門外控望，見無動靜，亦即回房，直至是晚七時，死者之夫歸來，始發覺菜籃仍置於室外桌上，而包趙氏已遭勒斃於床後。該屋樓下後門內兩旁有灶間各一，前爲客堂間，樓梯暗黑曲折，樓上有亭子間二，分由二房東及一陳姓之三輪車夫所居，前後廂房各一，及死者之前樓一間，共居有八戶二十餘人之多，據包某語記者稱：平日死者與同屋諸人均極熟稔，但事後同居者諱莫如深，咸稱是日未知發生凶案，但證諸包趙氏之菜籃置於門外達七小時餘，且入內後始終未見外出，竟未爲同居者所發覺，此中顯有疑竇，同時包趙氏死狀殊慘，但損失僅爲手上金飾，而凶手必欲置氏於死地，其原因亦堪研究云。現死者家屬一面擬籲請定海同鄉會加以援手，一面仍盼警局根據所獲綫索，力緝凶犯。</p>

<h3 id="c90">自治通則草案之批判　上接二版星期論壇 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>第四，草案之比較自憲法頒布以後，內政部曾有省縣自治通則草案甲乙兩案，及直轄市自治通則草案，（茲假定爲丙案），市自治通則草案，（茲假定爲丁案）共四種，雖詳略各有不同，而其斟酌損益之處，實各有見地，各具苦心。甲乙兩案係專爲省縣自治而設，丙丁兩案係專爲直轄市自治而設，因對象之不同，故其內容遂有詳略精粗之殊異。就省縣自治的甲乙兩案言之，則甲案係規撫省縣各級組織綱要而成，因循舊制，加以變革，故較適用於現有之省縣。但其缺點則內容空虛，缺乏革新精神與指導作用。而乙案之內容，遠較甲案爲佳。其中心思想，乃根據於國父之「地方自治團體，不僅爲一政治組織，且爲「經濟組織」之理論；其特色爲以合作社爲鄉鎭自治組織之核心，以組織之力量，與合作之精神爲基點，而發揮雙手萬能之效用，增加生產，改良分配。換言之，不以原始的·封建的。舊鄕鎭隣閶的地方性結合爲單位而代之以簇新的·革命的。經濟性結合爲單位。寓有改造社會，推進全民政治之遠大理想，且寓有社會主義之光輝色彩。故就甲乙丙丁四案之高尙理想言之，則乙案無疑爲一最優秀之傑作。惜規實狀况與此項理想，相距過遠，而辦理此項自治之人才，更成問題，若淪於胥吏豪紳之手，則此項計劃必將全盤失敗，故此案目前似難適用。</p>
<p>更就直轄市之丙丁兩案言之，則丙案亦與甲案相同，缺乏市政的革新精神，與指導作用，遠不如丁案之內容豐富，設想周密，而有最新市政之設計，其優點極多，爲他案所無。茲分述於後，以見該案實爲直轄市自治通則中最良好最合用之草案也。</p>
<p>（一）計劃都市與都市計劃就國家言之，應有計劃都市之設計；就都市言之，應有都市計劃之設計。何以言之，都市不能任其盲目發展，而造成種種供需不相應，彼此不配合的畸形現象。故近代各國於都市計劃以外，皆有計劃都市之設計，以全國爲對象，以經濟發展爲中心，就其農業。物產·工商·文化之分布狀况，而分為若干區，區設若干城市，以爲加工轉運呑吐之中心。國父欲開闢東方大港，而以乍浦爲商埠，亦計劃都市之意也。大之有計劃都市，小之有都市計劃，互相配合，乃可造成國家整個之繁榮。今本案有「以點控綫，以綫控面」之設計，於都市之局部性的設計外，更顧到國家整個性之設計，用意良善，實可稱揚。</p>
<p>（二）各種市制並列待選各直轄市分布全國，其人口多寡，工商狀况，文化水準，生活習慣，各各不同，故市制之採用，有宜於甲地者，不一定宜於乙地，如市委員制祗宜於人口較少之小城市，而不宜於人口較多之大城市。市長制，與市長市參事會制，祗宜於大城市而不宜於小城市是也。欲以一種市制而强全國大小不等之市，同納於一個軌範之內，其事甚難，故本案將各種市制，一併列人，一任各城市之自由選擇，實爲最能顧到各地之實際需要也。</p>
<p>（三）市府編制不宜固定　市政府之組織，編制，因市區大小，人口多寡，經濟榮枯，事務繁簡而不同，故大城市之組織編制，成且較小城市大至兩倍或三倍而有餘，自治通則之中，自不宜作固定之規定，使各市無伸縮增减之餘地。今本案僅云市政府設局處科，分別辦事，其編制與員額，亦不加以硬性規定，極有見地。</p>
<p>（四）市地市有，市有市辦。大都市之土地問題，如不作澈底之解決，最易造成貧富懸殊之畸形現象。故國父平均地權，節制資本之政策，首應從大都市實施，而市地市有之政策，世界各國多已實行，中國自應乘此次實行自治之時，一舉將原則確定。至於實施步驟，不妨分期進行。市有公產，應確立市營之原則，俾市財政有所取給。今本案將此兩項原則，於通則中加以確定，積極以開闢地方之財源，消極以掃除資本築中之規效，其意甚著。</p>
<p>（五）財政收入分別主輔。市政府財政收入，過去完全取給於捐稅，苟有設施，即須加稅，而絕不注意市公產之經營與收益，以致財源枯涸，苛雜日增。今本案特定：「市財政應以市有土地之地租，及公營事業之收入爲主，稅捐收入爲輔，並以自給自足爲原則。」足以限制市府向自給自足之路努力，而减輕人民之負擔，允有獨到之處。</p>
<h3 id="c91">從民國廿年大水災　看長江水勢 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員康風</p>
<p>四分之三的江域命運繫於今後之水位　倘上游有止漲消息沿可保留半分元氣</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖廿二日快訊〕今春降雨特多，使冬枯的長江很早就容滿了江水，夏泛時節，中國西部山區化雪的水入江，雪量去冬特大，滾滾入江，在春泛上加上夏泛，再加上特多的夏季雨量，長江水位就像傷寒病患者的陽子，高熱度幾乎一發不可收拾了，</p>
<p>從民國二十年大水災以後，到現在十七年中，長江流域年年豐收，抗戰十年中亦然，儘管他的兄弟黄河在花園口改道十年，使黄域東南部豫·皖·蘇·三千萬農夫冲得片瓦無存，長江的幸運却獨享，湘·鄂·皖·蘇·四省濱江居民所以能够輕巧的熬過抗戰十年痛苦，年年豐收是個最大原因。</p>
<p>也就因爲長江十七年來水量少，水位低，以及民廿一年宋子文主持的棉麥美貸所修棄的長江大堤束住了，江水的榜樣，沿江的人靠水吃水，由强豪領導，被招佃的貧農災戶供應勞動力，把江心中的冬露沙洲，洞庭鄱陽兩大湖與四省濱江各小湖劃地築垸造圩，於是原來容納夏泛的湖沼與江心沙地都成了肥美新田，這些肥沃的土地，出產特豐，湖沼築垸造圩後的稻田每畝約收八石以上稱子，像湖北人堅主創去的洞庭湖內天祐垸，數十萬畝稻田年收總是稻子二百萬石，像戰後安徽桐城，無爲，交界處陳瑤湖由普濟墾殖社開闢圩田廿五萬畝，去年度已築成的圩田二萬畝，即有十萬石的產量豐收了江心沙洲築圩成功以後把大豆芝蔴等雜糧撒上，即可生長，亦是季季豐收。這種呌水讓位的事，對於增產與救窮，是極好的妙藥。十七年來地方政府落得不去干涉，甚至一些首長們還是與領導增產。這種事，在水小年頭，對國民經濟整個局勢也有益無損，可是年久日長，原來作爲長江自然水庫的大小湖沼沙洲旣都成了永久的耕地，三峽區薩凡奇博士的美貸水庫，由於工費及時間尙未着手，碰上今年春泛夏泛的高水量，長江這使得濱江一億人口幸福十七年的大漢，在雷雨中怒吼着要來撕碎今年一億人口的秋收夢了。不僅當年自然水庫防綫今年被他冲潰，依然作爲他的水庫，他還連帶要冲毀沿江幹堤，把民二十年慘局重演一番。</p>
<p>面對這種洪水量，任何水利機構與治水專家都無能爲力了。水利部的經費只允許他配發各省平常年代的防水器材物資，如安徽長江幹堤八百公里，今年領到七萬條麻袋，倘若冲毁十公里缺口，七千萬條麻袋也救不了急在水位高到十一公尺廿五公分的今日，（七月廿二日蕪湖水位）堤頂才十三公尺高的江堤上，只好日夜拿上萬的農夫肉身來監護牠了。雷雨之夜，江濤冲岸，農夫們一發現有江堤小缺口或裂痕，就凄厲的喊呌着挑土去塡投。指揮搶救的鑼聲，一囝緊一陣的敲着，從七月十五日到今天已經快八天了，長江皖段，鄂段都是這般在監護着，眞像對一個患傷寒病的親人惟恐其最後幾天腸出血一般的焦慮憂急！</p>
<p>人們都知道洞庭湖新垸與老垸，均已全部陸沉，七月十九日重慶的高水位，於廿二·廿三·兩日到達武漢以後的後果可慮，漢口傳說屛障鄂皖北岸黄梅·宿松等七縣的馬華·同仁·兩堤已決口，（此刻皖段長江工務所尙未接到馬華決堤的報吿）看起來，長江水勢，在七月份已經闖了大禍，但這還只使約佔四分之一的江域不安，八月份與七月最後九天是其餘江域四分之三的稻田決定關頭。稻子遍野均結穗了，再有三十天即可收割，倘若長江上游有止漲消息，江域還可保留半分元氣，我們緊緊的注視這一江黄水向東流罷！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紡建公司昨有長達五千字之呈文電陳行政院翁院長，列舉該公司目前遭受之實際困難，並請求中央設法予以解除。公司目下之困難，有下列各端：（一）原棉問題。因棉產區火鄧淪爲匪區，不能深入採購；其未淪陷者，亦因運輸困難，各地棉花出境有限制，及農民堅持以銀元交易等理由，不能大量採購。目前該公司推行之以紗易棉辦法，成效尙不可知。過去外棉接濟量較多，尙能維持生產，今則外援减少，致工廠原棉存底大减。（二）因輪入厲行管制之，各廠零件不能獲得補充，影響工作效率。且因煤電供應之不足，工廠大多局部開工。如營口等地因戰事關係，損失甚大，開工之紗錠布機均少。（三）供應軍用服裝材料問題。此項供應，數字龐大，且爲先交易後結價，並以盈餘扣抵貨款，故公司損失甚大。公司資力有限，長此以往，不勝負担。（四）配售公敎員工布疋。因屬先交貨後結價，及預以盈餘扣抵貨款，損失之大，約値原棉二萬二千担。（五）平價配銷。公司爲配合政令，辦理平銷，以穩定紗布市價，但因配價遠低於市價，損失殊鉅。目前改善辦法，首先爲充實原棉存底，除加緊收購工作外，擬擴大紗布換棉辦法，並提高外銷數量，大量換進原棉。軍布之配給，希望今後能實施現款現貨交易。並盼政院明令各地對棉花之採購運送，加以保護；煤電油料之供給，應予紡建各廠以優先權，因其供給軍民需要，不容减產也。</p>

<p>沿革</p>
<p>南通學院已具有四十三年歷史，其前身爲南通張季直先生所創辦之農·醫·與紡織三專校，迨十八年三校合併，呈准敎育部始改今名。抗戰軍興，南通淪陷，二十七年秋該校遷滬復課。勝利後於三十五六兩年間仍分期還校南通，惟以設備敎學等關係，農紡二科迄今尙有一部份在滬上課。近以蘇北秩序尙未大定，該校將決定通滬分設，不再遷併，以利進行。</p>
<p>現況</p>
<p>該校現有農·醫·紡織三科。農科設農藝，畜牧獸醫，農業經濟三系。紡織科設紡織工程，染化工程二系。醫科照醫學院規定，不分系。全院敎職員一百六十餘人，學生九百餘人，通滬分佈約爲四與一之比。該校更以農醫紡三科爲實際應用學科，故各科附屬事業，極爲完備。農科有農塲，畜牧塲，農產加工塲等，農場面積在南通校內者僅及百畝。另濱海地帶尙有棉田七百畝，待墾田十二萬畝。惜因交通阻滯，勝利後尙未應用。醫科有附屬醫院一所，設病牀一百五十張，醫師三十餘人，足爲蘇北濱海濱江一帶之中心醫院。紡織科實習紡織廠，織廠，漂染整理廠等三廠。現紡廠開工，其餘二廠在整理中。</p>
<p>招生</p>
<p>該校本屆各系一律招收新生，並酌收插班生，新生收高中畢業或其同等學力，插班生須有相當班次之轉學體書，均男女兼收。考試科目及報考手續，與一般大學略同。報名日期爲八月五日至七日，考試日期爲八月九十兩日，地點分在上海南通兩地舉行，上海地點在重慶北路二七〇號。</p>

<p>〔中央社倫敦廿三日電〕中國萬公尺長跑冠軍樓文敖，本日在奧克斯橋世運全塲練習，甚多觀眾咸認樓爲中國世運代表隊中最出風頭之人物。樓在練習中起跑時，並無任何驚人之成績表現，但新聞記者觀其以往之紀錄，認爲樓在本屆大會得分，並非毫無可能性。樓與陪跑者在最近之練習中，通常均着跑鞋，且精神健旺。渠與台灣選手陳英郎同室居住，同行練習。但樓最近練習之非正式成績，並無特異處，因其從未面對眞正之比賽。此間體靑觀察家料信渠將有長足進步，渠無疑爲中國本屆世運會最有希望之得分者。又中國世運籃球隊昨日與較爲不甚著名之埃及隊在練習賽中，以一面倒之六十七對四十紀錄敗北，「令人驚詫」。埃及隊僅有四年之經騐，惟應用美式敎練後，展出最新式之球術，且投籃極爲準確。埃及隊以前並曾與韓國籃球隊作練習賽。刻中國籃球隊定於七月廿九日世運會正式揭幕前，作數塲比賽。</p>

<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>今人每指陳敎育界若干弊病，輙曰「救救孩子」。却不知道家長也實在已經到了非念救不可的地步了。</p>
<p>在大鈔剛剛發行，法幣幣値慘跌的今日，人民對法幣的信仰本來已經頗爲動搖，而大小學店的老板們竟就在這樣一個人心浮動的時候，公然率先倡導學費要以白米幾担論値，明明白白的對法幣的信用加以正面的打擊——而至今未聞敎育當局有什麽制止的行動。</p>
<p>不但不予以制止，而且還在推波助瀾！</p>
<p>請看二十二日本報的敎育版。巿敎育局又要統一規定本巿中等學校學生的制服了。「高級男生爲中山裝，女生爲旗袍。初級男女生均爲童子軍服……顏色春夏爲淡黄，秋冬爲常靑。」看了這種消息，眞呌人起啼笑皆非之感！今日何日？民生凋敝，工商業簫條，薪水階級已有　飱不繼之勢，好容易才使自己的子弟有一件舊衣服穿，也就算了。而今乃於跨進了學校大門口這個「論米計値」的高門坎之後，再要嚐嚐這「官定」的斧頭滋味！每一個學生要添兩套衣服，試問要多少錢？闊人家的少爺小姐們固然也許還要嫌這種制服太整脚，要凟了金枝玉葉的身份；但是在此時此地，闊人家的少爺小姐們倒底祗有多少？我不知市敎育當局平日有沒有看報的工夫，否則，他就不該忘掉：最近在無錫寗波等地方，還曾經發生了搶米的風潮！今日應當是筆路藍縷，慘淡經營的時候，要表現事功，很不必專門着眼於表面文章。如果這種表面文章並不妨害老百姓，倒還不過表示做官的人們之閒倩逸致，無非讓公文多兜幾個圈子而已，倒底也還可以養活幾個吃不飽餓不殺的小公務員。可惡的是：凡公事之加重人民負担者，這些公文旅行起來往往偏是非常迅速，所以我們不能不担心，不能不表示關切。</p>
<p>再說，中學生穿了制服又有什麽好處？整齊，美觀？如果是太平盛世，人民足衣足食，講講整齊美觀倒也罷了。但是，現在却不同。如果還有人閉矓了眼睛高叫要整齊美觀云云，這個人若非神經病，就頗可與當年的晋惠帝媲美了。</p>
<p>而且，學生們明明已經有衣服穿而忽然要做新衣裳，這一筆物資的浪費也蒲實可觀。我們不是費盡了九牛二虎之力才從美國運來了棉花嗎？物資如此難得，使用的時候應當如何珍惜！何以還要大量的消耗在這種可以節省的地方？如果我們說得苛刻一點，在現在的局勢下還要這樣故意的浪費物資，簡直就是Sabotage，也就是在有意無意中協助了叛亂！</p>
<p>今天的急務是必須力求社會之安定，要社會安定，就切忌不必要地加重人民的負担。學生們能够走進校門就已經大不容易，制服之類，不亦可以已乎？時値大伏天氣，敎育局的袞袞諸公似應輪流到乍浦路橋北堍庇亞士公寓附近走走，多看看鳩形鵠面的難民，也許倒可以治「熱昏」之症也。</p>

<p>— 竹影</p>
<p>肥城桃爲山東肥城縣之特產，桃色黄，嘴內陷，核圓小，味甘美，大者重半磅有奇，暢銷於平津各大商埠，價甚昂。今市上所售者，皮色綠，嘴尖小者，多屬赝品。前客肥城時，友人劉君時相饡贈，遂得常嘗此桃佳味。桃以城內二三桃園出品者爲正種，城週三十里內所產者，亦稱肥桃，味稍遜。每屆初秋，肩挑負販者流，接踵於途，惜所販者不盡爲肥桃也。鄉民多植桃爲業，城內各園余嘗往參觀，樹不甚大，桃纍纍然，枝葉甚茂，全恃人力培植，各主枝都使之平衡發展，各側枝幾全部爲結果枝，所有受病害及蟲害之枝條，全部剪去，在剪定時，依其年齡，決定結果數。花含苞時最怕有霧，桃樹林下恒置麥草數堆，每値五更落務時，縱火焚之，烟冲天半，以禦霧氣。當春深開花時，園人看護維勤，因折其一花，即損其一桃，一枝之花更不知損桃多少也。因折花而涉訟者有之。摘桃時以一布囊繁諸竿上，見色熟者，持竿摘取，桃隨竿落，以囊承之。</p>
<p>園中皆供桃仙，香火供奉，不敢有忤，謂忤神則一夜桃落，剝其肉，僅餘核，嘴皆上仰，此則迷信之談也。</p>

<p>在第二次大戰期間，印度的一個地方曾大鬧殘疾，英軍極力做預防工作，但却始終無法撲滅瘧蚊。</p>
<p>當美軍軍醫到印度的時候，他們想出了一個辦法。原來蚊子的求偶，完全依靠發出一種人耳無法聽到的超音波來吸引異性的。美國軍醫在曠野裏設立許多發音機，播送與雌蚊同頻率的音波，吸引雄蚊，聚而殲之。雖然咬人的大多是雌蚊，但雄蚊一經消減，雌蚊便也無法繁殖後代，一塲兇險的瘧疾便這樣漸漸平息了。</p>

<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>看了電影歸來，或是友朋相叙淸談的時候，除了討論劇情外，電影明星個人的美麗·嫵媚·大方·優雅等也必在談論之例。你歡喜甲明星，而他愛好乙明星，也許你們會爲了爭論「自己的明星」的優美，而各不相讓，鬧得面紅耳赤吧？</p>
<p>我們對於明星的各有所愛好與崇拜，仔細考察起來，不是沒有原因的。但長我們許多心理活動都是不自覺的，就是所謂「下意識」的活動。爲什麽偏愛某一個明星，也是「下意識」活動的一種。</p>
<p>對於同性明星的愛好（就是說男人看男明星，或女人看女明星），基本原則是「愛好與自己相類似的」。無論在體格上，面貌上，性格上，姿態上的全部或一部分，或者竟是極小極微的一些小勤作，小習慣相同而已，就會引起我們的好感與偏愛。例如愛好運動的，對體格强健的明星特別崇拜；談吐溫文的，對溫柔風雅的明星特別愛好；瘦長的喜歡瘦長的；活潑的偏愛活潑的；明眸善睞的特別喜歡長睫毛和大眼睛的……可以依此舉一反三。</p>
<p>對於異性明星的崇拜與好感，原因就比較難於探索，因爲我們的下意識更加複雜了。美國Hilary　Lynn氏曾就美國女性對男明星的偏好加以分析，得到一些結論。我國的女影迷們不妨將他的結論與你的性格對照一下，看他說得對不對。</p>
<p>崇拜克拉克蓋博爾，埃洛茀林，「泰山」韋司歷拉等——你是頤受男子支配的，你甘願給强有力的男子征服。你喜歡果斷·堅毅·英雄氣概的男子漢。你也喜歡他一往直前，不顧一切的追求你。</p>
<p>崇拜考爾門，却爾斯鮑育，等——你喜歡神秘性的東西。愛聽別人的秘密，也希望別人對你傾吐他的秘密，也愛別人探索你的秘密。這種態度安詳而矜持，自信力很强的男子，雖然他的情感似乎較淡漠，可是對你却富有挑撥性！他能使你肯用全力去追求他，粉身碎骨，在所不借。</p>
<p>崇拜詹姆士史德華，凱尼培格等—你要支配男子。你憐憫弱小。這種肯聽話，帶有孩子氣的男子，雖然笨拙怕羞，却足以激起你母性的愛情。</p>
<p>崇拜李思廉霍華，泰羅鮑華，賈萊可柏等—你喜歡舉止優雅，談吐溫文，敏感的，理想的，極羅曼蒂克的情人。他的愛情純潔高超，爲了愛情甘願抹煞自己，犧牲一切。但是你沒有在現實的生活中遇見這樣的男子，將來恐怕也不會有。他是你夢想世界裏的愛人。</p>
<p>崇拜羅勃泰勒的—你喜變化，善交際，性格捉摸不定，你是要支配男子的。</p>
<p>崇拜平克勞斯貝，洛勃蒙高茂萊，茀當亞斯坦，—你喜歡愉快的，糊塗的，談吐生風的小生。你愛管理男子，支配男子。</p>
<p>東鱗西爪　咸斯聯合國的代表每發表演說一小時，職員們翻譯，紀錄，整理……等工作需要三百八十八「工時」之多（即三百八十八人同時工作需要一小時，若一人工作，就需三百八十八小時）。</p>
<p>英國新發明一種一壁上無線電收音機一，樣子完全像一幅世界地圖，可以掛在牆上。你如果要聽巴黎電台的廣播，你祗要用一只燈泡插在地圖上標明「巴黎」的地方，就可以極淸晰地收聽；如果要聽倫敦的廣播，祗要把燈泡插在地圖上標明「倫敦」之處。英國的另一種新花樣是脚踏車上也可以裝無線電收音機，像在汽車上一樣。</p>
<p>美國近年來積極開發阿拉斯加，最初的動機是爲了鞏固國防，不想移殖到那邊去的人們發現了金礦，於是要求前往該地者激增。而在開礦的時候，竟又掘出了極多的化石和史前初民遺蹟，非常名貴，居民們利巿三倍。</p>

<p>當代名人之以「詠寬」爲字者，翁文灝及其親翁張壽鏞（已故）外，尙有京朝舊伶雪艷琴。（雪之本名爲黄詠霓。）翁張事，無可書，亦不必書，而艷琴之遭際，濃縮之可爲一百萬字之長篇小說，固宛然哈代翁筆下之悲劇脚色。</p>
<p>二十五年以前，北京有四女伶，聲聞最茂，爲「黎曹交替時期」之政治邊頁人物，艷琴與焉。其他三人爲琴雪芳·碧雲霞·金少梅，而艷琴最穉。今夏，筆者旅北平，曾於宣武門荒攤，得艷琴在太原所攝常服圖像一紙，執番筆作抄寫狀，旁置皮郛之書無數，此女習伶，而性近文事，故有此模擬之作。當時四女伶，以碧雲霞生活爲最蕪雜，琴雪芳與艷琴以奉穆教，生活校能凈化，而雪芳簡傲固執，猶不若艷琴之天機活潑焉。</p>
<p>近十餘年來，艷琴嫁濟儀之弟溥侊，曾同居於東京。恍雖紈袴不事生產，而始終不附湛儀。七七戰作後，陷日之文化界人士，固常假侊宅爲觴會，陰實議脫逃。某君掩護郭鼎堂之出走，亦先定計於恍廬，造成此局面與氣分者，艷琴好與文藝人士往遠之故，非侊之眞有此灼然遠見也。</p>
<p>未幾，艷琴復挾溥侊同回北平，恍已無恒產，惟日恃嚙食艷琴之餘財以活，中復別戀一鼓姬，前年遂吿仳離。艷琴至是僅餘小屋二棟，月得賃金麵粉數袋而已。艷琴年逾四十，而氣度俊雅，髮光如漆。所居與小說家張恨水爲比鄰，能畫簡單之花卉，人稱「黄太太」。</p>

<p>廿六年戰事纔起的時候，有些人還祗留些黑鬍鬚，一年二年，到勝利之時鬚髮已經完全白了。我的一個鄰人就是如此。有些人還剛剛是一個大孩子，一年二年，八年之後已經完全脫去了孩子的影子，我就是如此。在戰爭中，人們的歲月祗在可憐的等待與盼望之中。八年之後，人們重新開始可憐的盼望與等待。一年二年，靑年人將要逐漸老去。</p>
<p>日子是灰白的，即使形體不曾袞老，人們的心也在衰老枯萎。落雨天的早晨，坐了三輪車出門去，經過兩條相當冷靜的街，看見一對年靑的男女迎面走來，露着憂愁的顏色。我雖不知道他們所憂愁的事情，但一定多數是屬於金錢，生活，婚姻。我想是如此。今天的靑年們是不幸的一代，我好久沒有看見過露着靑年的快樂活潑朝氣的顏色的人了，年靑的人沒有青春的愉快。我現在連電影院也難得去，票價太貴了。有一次在蘇州看了一次五彩電影，電影上面樹葉豐美的原野，太平洋彼岸的廣闊平坦的公路，藍晶晶的天空，艷麗的陽光。我覺得這樣美好的陽光似乎在我們的生活之中也好久未見了。似乎我們的生活每大是陰天。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The first session of the First Legislative Yuan formally concluded on the 24th, commencing recess from the 25th. The 22nd meeting, being the final session of the first term, addressed numerous crucial matters throughout the 24th, concluding amidst applause. President Sun, before adjourning, delivered a brief address, reviewing the session's work, stating approximately: "At the beginning of constitutional governance, the Legislative Yuan's extensive scale, coupled with the inexperience of colleagues and staff, initially caused a sense of disarray. However, with the formal establishment of each committee and the commencement of proposal review, the Yuan's affairs gradually normalized, which is gratifying. Particularly noteworthy is the efficiency and achievements of the Budget Committee in handling the general budget over the past two weeks, deserving commendation and admiration from colleagues." He then reported on the progress of facilities for the Legislative Yuan's offices and the residences of legislators, expressing hope that these issues would be gradually resolved within six months. He concluded by stating: "It is a great honor to work alongside colleagues to initiate this new era of constitutional governance. I sincerely hope that the nation's situation will steadily improve, thereby enhancing the Legislative Yuan's achievements even further." The Legislative Yuan also passed a provisional motion during the meeting on the 24th, resolving that the next session will convene anew in September, as stipulated by the Constitution, without delay. During the recess period, the work of each committee, under the direction of Committee Member Tian Liujing, will continue as usual. The pending cases, including the unresolved portions of the general budget, will continue to be reviewed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The review report on the National General Budget for the second half of the 37th year, passed by the Legislative Yuan, is being expedited by the Budget Committee, with the expectation that it will be conveyed to the Executive Yuan on the 26th. The Executive Yuan will determine the announcement of the general budget thereafter. The Legislative Yuan also passed a provisional motion from the Procedure Committee during the meeting on the 24th, stating that the organizational laws, regulations, or ordinances of various government agencies whose budgets have been eliminated and are slated for abolishment, such as the National Economy Committee, the Flower Management Committee, the Fuel Management Committee, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, should be simultaneously declared abolished when the review report on the National General Budget is conveyed to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The 22nd Session of the Legislative Yuan Passes; Investigation Bureau Subordinated to Ministry of Interior; Heated Debate Ensued Before Vote <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The 22nd meeting of the First Legislative Yuan session was held on the 24th, chaired by Sun Ke. The meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, initially proceeding with report items. Following the adoption of the minutes of the 20th and 21st meetings, it was resolved to assign three draft laws submitted by the Executive Yuan to committees for review. These included: (1) the draft organizational law of the National Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the draft organizational regulations of the various regional National Taxation Bureaus, National Tax Collection Bureaus, Directly-Administered Direct Taxation Bureaus, and Directly-Administered Commodity Tax Bureaus under the Ministry of Finance; (2) the draft organizational regulations of the National Policy Advisor Committee and the Strategic Advisor Committee of the Presidential Office; and (3) the draft organizational law of the Ministry of National Defense. Subsequently, President Sun reported that the provisional regulations regarding the salaries and public expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members, drafted by the Yuan's Legal System Committee, had been passed at the secret meeting on the 23rd and had been instructed to the Secretariat to prepare the budget accordingly. Discussion items began promptly at 10:00 AM. The first item was the Legal System Committee's review report on the draft organizational regulations of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The second item was a proposal by Shen Chongyu and 169 others, offering amendments to the aforementioned proposal, advocating for the Investigation Bureau to be subordinated to the Ministry of Interior. Both items were discussed concurrently. Following explanations by Zhang Jinjian, the convener of the Legal System Committee, and Shen Chongyu, the proposer of the amendment, a heated debate ensued. Those supporting the original proposal argued that establishing a body to safeguard national and social security within the judicial system would be a progressive step, emphasizing the bureau's future role in legal and technical aspects, with investigative powers but no authority to take action. Opponents argued that China already had an abundance of such institutions, yet the communist bandits continued to run rampant, casting doubt on their effectiveness. They contended that the judicial system should be open and impartial, and the Legislative Yuan should not hastily conflate the two, which could lead to adverse consequences. Some committee members advocated for retaining the original proposal, while the majority expressed that a compromise could be reached for political reasons, but they would never allow subordination to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. After more than an hour of debate, the meeting took a break and then proceeded to a vote. Initially, a vote was held on the suggestion to retain the original proposal. Out of 243 committee members present, 112 were in favor. Committee members opposing the original proposal then requested a counter-vote. The result of the counter-vote was 134 in favor out of 247 committee members present, and the suggestion to retain the original proposal was again rejected. However, the committee members opposing the original proposal remained dissatisfied, raising questions about the vote count and requesting a revote. Those opposing the counter-vote argued that such a vote was illegal. Simultaneously, some advocated for a division of seats for voting, while others advocated for a secret ballot. The entire venue was thrown into chaos for a time. At this juncture, Jiang Yiping raised a procedural issue, arguing that there were three views on the original proposal: retention, amendment, and upholding. By law, each should be voted on in turn, and the process should not be hindered by the repeated insistence of a minority on one view. President Sun also angrily exclaimed: "Please, everyone, pay attention to order! You have your own seats but you don't sit in them, instead scattering in the back rows, and then claim the count is wrong! You should all sit properly in the front rows before voting again." The committee members then returned to their original seats and, amidst a tense atmosphere, recounted the numbers and revoted on the three views in turn. The result was that out of 314 committee members present, 113 were in favor of retaining the original proposal, while 170 were in favor of the amendment by Shen Chongyu and others. Consequently, it was resolved to subordinate the Investigation Bureau to the Ministry of Interior. The original proposal and the amendment were jointly referred to the Legal System Committee and the Interior and Local Autonomy Committee for re-examination and revision of the draft organizational regulations. The uproar subsided, and adjournment for lunch was announced at about 12:00 PM.</p>

<p>The meeting resumed at 3:45 PM, smoothly processing several cases. (1) The National Defense Committee reported on the review of the President's submission for retroactive recognition of martial law declared in Guangyuan, resolving to grant retroactive recognition in accordance with the review comments. (2) The Legal System Committee reported on the review of the draft organizational regulations for the various committees of the Control Yuan, resolving to pass it as amended by the review amendment.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that Chiang, the Director-General of the KMT, will soon invite KMT members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans for talks.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] As the Legislative Yuan will be in recess from the 25th, and the Supervisory Yuan will also be in recess in the coming days, the Central Committee of the KMT plans to convene a symposium within two or three days, inviting party members among the legislative and supervisory members to exchange opinions on reforming party affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Leakage of Secret Meeting Information: The Legislative Yuan Passes the Investigation Committee's Report <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Legislative Yuan passed the investigation report submitted by the Yuan's Committee for Investigating the Leakage of Information from Secret Meetings, as well as the decision that the leakage and publication of secret information were due to the absence of sanctions for more than a decade, which had become customary. Now that the Yuan had investigated and handled the matter seriously, and various newspapers had cooperated fully, it would be inappropriate to impose significant responsibility abruptly. Moreover, the responsibility of the leaker was far greater than that of the interviewer and publisher. If the leaker could not be identified, the publisher could not bear sole responsibility. The following four decisions were recorded: (1) A list of newspapers that published secret financial, monetary, diplomatic, and military information related to the Yuan will be sent to the Executive Yuan for appropriate handling. (2) The committee members of this Yuan who also hold positions at newspapers are requested to inform their respective newspapers to cooperate fully with this Yuan in the future and effectively prevent the leakage of secret information. (3) In addition to issuing special entry and exit passes, a personal photograph will be attached to the passes for all personnel attending secret meetings. (4) The Legal System Committee is requested to formulate rules and penalties for adherence to secret meetings, based on the principles resolved at the International Press Conference, to serve as guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="e8">President Weng Broadcasts to Domestic and International Audiences: Explaining the Necessity of Unity and Mobilization; Must Gather Strength to Suppress Rebellion to Protect the Nation and People <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] President Weng Wenhao broadcasted to domestic and international audiences on the Central Broadcasting Station this evening. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>This address focuses on explaining the necessity for national unity and accelerated mobilization during this period of suppressing rebellion. To understand the overall situation of our country, one must first understand the international situation of the world: World War II was the result of many countries uniting to defeat Germany and Japan, which actively pursued external aggression. Our country was united and fought with sincerity for eight years before achieving victory and recovering territories lost over fifty years. Just as the war was declared over, peace realized, and we could enter an era of genuine construction and achieve comfort and security, unfortunately, the world situation was disrupted by the Communist Party. They call themselves a political party, but in reality, they fully exploit strikes, student boycotts, and other turmoil to carry out riots and use force to devastate and destroy the people's property and the nation's integrity. This kind of action is certainly not what a political party should do; it is truly an act of rebellion against the order of political parties and legally organized bodies. It is clear that the communist parties of various countries have a consistent goal and joint actions. They echo each other to attack genuine democratic politics and undermine the people's inherent freedoms. Therefore, for the sake of protecting the country and the people, we must be of one mind and united in sincerity, gathering the strength of the entire nation to undertake our sacred mission of suppressing rebellion and saving the country.</p>
<p>Sincerely Implementing Constitutionalism, Exuding the Spirit of Progress</p>
<p>During this same period, our country is sincerely implementing constitutionalism. So-called constitutionalism is the formal end of the Kuomintang's era of political tutelage, returning political power to the people, who elect a National Assembly, formulate a constitution, and, based on public opinion, form a five-power government to exercise constitutional governance. This proves that Chinese politics has genuinely embarked on the path of democracy, working for the benefit of the people. At the beginning of implementing constitutionalism, to bear the responsibility of suppressing rebellion, we must first bring forth the spirit of mobilization and progress. This spirit was fully demonstrated during the Legislative Yuan's review of the budget, which was divided into two main points: one is to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and the other is to cut down on redundant agencies and superfluous personnel as much as possible. From this perspective, all expenditures not related to military suppression of bandits or urgent economic production should be seriously tightened or completely eliminated. This fully proves that the two tasks of implementing constitutionalism and suppressing rebellion can be carried out simultaneously, complementing each other and enhancing practical effectiveness.</p>
<p>Simplifying Institutions, Concentrating Manpower and Resources</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, the above-mentioned guidelines must be faithfully executed. Current implementations, such as the Ministry of Finance merging the Direct Tax Administration and the Commodity Tax Agency into one, reorganizing it into the National Tax Administration, simplifying the complex and reducing unnecessary personnel, and saving excessive expenditures, have the significance of tightening expenditures and increasing efficiency. In addition, the administrative branch will implement the agencies that the Legislative Yuan has determined should be cut down, and will also devise other methods to strengthen the process in the same direction. On the other hand, to increase the power to suppress the rebellion, we must be able to use the material and human resources of the whole country. Within the scope of material resources, food is even more important. Since ancient times, our country has believed that sufficient food and soldiers are the fundamental conditions for establishing a nation. To ensure sufficient food, the government has decided to implement the method of compulsory purchase and borrowing of grain. The Legislative Yuan's resolution also stipulates that the proportion of compulsory purchase should be increased and the amount of purchases at market price should be reduced, which shows that both the legislative and executive branches recognize the necessity of implementing this method, solemnly propose it, and seriously implement it. In practice, the burden on the people will inevitably be heavier, but our country's land tax has been used since the early Qing Dynasty, and prices have risen sharply, but the tax rate has not increased. During this period of suppressing rebellion, all compatriots across the country should enthusiastically support the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines, making sincere contributions, and everyone should contribute together. Therefore, it is extremely hoped that all levels of responsible executive agencies and personnel will also clearly recognize that delivering grain is a major duty at this time, lift their spirits, collect the full amount, and never be deficient or evade under any pretext.</p>
<p>Stopping and Reducing Inflation is a Matter of Utmost Urgency</p>
<p>Although there are many reasons for the current high prices, the important reason is inflation. The reason for inflation is that government spending is too high, so how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure and drastically stop and reduce inflation is the most important urgent task today. How to achieve this goal, the central government is planning methods to implement them seriously. However, this kind of necessity still requires the deep understanding and concerted action of all agencies and all aspects to succeed. This is an important point that we are calling to everyone's attention. Secondly, what I want to explain is that during this period of suppressing rebellion, it is extremely necessary for social order to be maintained and the economic situation to be stable. The people and government of our friendly country, the United States, have always sympathized with our country's hardships, and at this time they are allocating funds and donating materials to assist in construction, which is extremely beneficial to our country's overall situation. But our country should know that the effectiveness of American aid depends on whether our country can help itself. If our country can truly help itself, then the effect will be strengthened by American aid. If our country cannot help itself, then strength will be weakened by division, and resources will be ineffective due to chaos. Even with American aid, its actual effectiveness will not be as good as expected. Therefore, we must deeply establish the determination to move forward proactively. Previous errors should be sincerely corrected, and incomplete areas should be quickly supplemented. We should make the greatest efforts to improve the effectiveness of our work. Comparing the psychology of the period of suppressing rebellion with that of the period of resistance against Japan, the importance of suppressing rebellion is no less than that of resistance against Japan, but the unity and tension of social psychology are not as good. Therefore, it is hoped that all compatriots across the country will understand that the actions of the communist bandits truly endanger the foundation of the country. Today is truly a time of crisis for the survival of China's inherent culture and normal organization. Everyone is connected as one, sharing good and bad fortune. We must intensify mobilization and move forward seriously in order to support the country's fortune and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan stated on the 24th: "The total revenue of the National General Budget for the second half of this year, reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, has been increased by over 2.6 trillion yuan based on the figures originally listed by the Executive Yuan (it could have been increased by over 3.1 trillion, but because the salt tax was not increased, it was increased by fifty billion less). This increase in amount is not due to an increase in tax rates, but mostly due to the fact that the revenue figures originally listed for various state-owned enterprises and various taxes were increased in a verified manner. That is, if the originally listed figure was too low, it was increased according to the actual situation during the review, and the amount of this increase was determined after inviting the responsible persons of the various competent authorities to discuss it together, so it is very reliable." In addition, redundant agencies and superfluous personnel of various agencies have been cut down as much as possible, and projects or construction expenditures that are not related to military affairs and can be postponed have also been eliminated to comply with the purpose of reducing expenditure. However, frontline combat soldiers have been given preferential treatment, and it has been decided that the Ministry of National Defense will issue a "combat allowance" to each person based on a pre-war base of one yuan.</p>

<p>The Standards for Salaries and Public Expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Members Are Not High</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] On the 24th, the spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan, under orders, issued a written statement on the issue of the standards for the salaries and public expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members, stating: "This time, the salaries and public expenses of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members were determined with reference to the examples of the salaries and travel expenses paid to members of parliament in the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Australia, Italy, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland, and are far lower than the standards paid to members of parliament in various countries. As for the transportation fee of 30 yuan and the housing subsidy of 40 yuan, these were originally part of the Yuan's office expenses. If the Yuan can provide the committee members with accommodation in guest houses and transportation, then these two expenses will not be paid. Currently, some legislators are staying in hotels, and the Yuan pays the hotel expenses, so the 40 yuan housing subsidy is not issued as an example." He also continued: "Outsiders believe that the standards for the salaries of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members are too high, but I do not think so. I am not defending the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members, but in fact, the salaries and public expenses obtained by the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members are not as much as the income of assistant staff in banks. However, the treatment of general civil servants is too low, so the treatment of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members appears to be too high. This view should be corrected, because the treatment of general civil servants is too low, which is definitely not a reasonable phenomenon, and everyone knows that it should be adjusted reasonably as soon as possible, which is the right thing to do. Therefore, legislators Jian Dangsan and Jin Shaoxian have long proposed that the treatment of public personnel should be improved, and Chen Mingxian and others have also proposed that the treatment of county-level public school teachers should be improved. It is hoped that the world of discussion will supervise the government to implement these measures as soon as possible, so that public school teachers can work wholeheartedly and improve administrative efficiency."</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] On the 24th, Henan Province Chairman Lu Yuwen spoke to reporters regarding the criticism of his corruption by the Liujing National Delegates Association, stating that he would not argue about whether he had been corrupt during his tenure in the Henan Grain Management Bureau, and that the competent authorities, the Ministry of Food and the Executive Yuan, could prove everything. As for his opposition to the passage of the budget for the Wartime National Mobilization Committee in the Legislative Yuan, it was his personal view and opinion on national affairs, and regardless of the reaction from the outside world, he would continue to adhere to this opinion and would not change it in the slightest. Lu also stated: "A person's social status has its own social foundation, and I believe that the defamation of a few people will have no impact."</p>

<p>Li Zongren Tells Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] Recently, rumors of secret peace talks have been spreading here again. Vice President Li Zongren explained to United Press reporters today: "The psychology of Westerners and Easterners is different." When Westerners hear groundless rumors, they often want to refute them, while Easterners often let them rise and fall on their own. The so-called seeing something strange is not strange, and the strangeness will defeat itself. I do not want to come out and deny it, so as to increase the value of the rumors and cause some people to mistakenly believe that there is a reason for it. In short, this kind of rumor is not worthy of a wise man's smile.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Draft of the National Defense Ministry Organization Law Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Review by the Legal and National Defense Committees <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The draft of the new National Defense Ministry Organization Law was resolved by the Legislative Yuan's plenary session on the 24th to be submitted to the Legal Committee for joint review with the National Defense Committee. This draft was revised by the National Defense Ministry under the instruction of the Executive Yuan, based on the principles decided by the Legislative Yuan, and was passed by the Executive Yuan's ad hoc meeting on July 17th. Its explanation regarding the powers of the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of the General Staff is as follows: "The Minister of National Defense is one of the cabinet members of the Executive Yuan, and in the position of the head of the Ministry of National Defense, he is responsible for the coordination of national security policies and military organizations. Therefore, he is responsible for planning, reviewing, and coordinating matters related to the overall national defense policy and planning and general mobilization. He is responsible for formulating and promulgating military policies and guidelines, and for reviewing and supervising military and administrative affairs. In short, the Minister holds the power to make overall decisions on military administration, personnel, finance, and materials, and supervises and examines the work of the Chief of the General Staff in carrying out these policies and guidelines, so as to achieve the reality of subordinating the military to the administration." "The Chief of the General Staff, on the one hand, is the Chief of Staff to the President as commander-in-chief according to the Constitution, and on the other hand, in the administrative system, he is the administrative officer of the Minister, responsible for the planning, guidance, and implementation of military affairs. This system is based on the American system and adapted to the national conditions. In the United States, each of the Army, Navy, and Air Force has a Minister and a Chief of Staff, and the Department of Defense is the hub of cooperation among the three services, representing the President in forming policy decisions, and using joint staff headquarters and other institutions to closely coordinate the three services. Our National Defense Ministry has a single Chief of the General Staff, who receives military orders from the President and military administration from the Minister, and makes overall plans and guidance for military affairs, which are implemented by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Combined Logistics Headquarters. This organization is considered by the United States to be a more rational and progressive system, with clear lines of responsibility and specialized functions."</p>

<h3 id="e21">Criticism of the Draft Local Autonomy General Rules <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Hangbai</p>
<p>Since the implementation of constitutional governance by the Central Government, democratic thoughts and concepts of freedom have flourished throughout the country. Now that the Central Government has implemented constitutional governance, local autonomy must be completed quickly. This is a matter of course, and there is no room for delay or hesitation. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially organized a Local Autonomy Laws and Regulations Research Committee to collect data and study methods so that Shanghai's local autonomy work can be carried out smoothly. Since the meeting, many deliberations have been held, and it is felt that the main key at present lies in the central autonomy general rules, which are still in the drafting stage by the Ministry of Interior and under review by the Legislative Yuan. Each locality must wait for the promulgation of the general rules before it can draft local autonomy laws based on the general rules. However, if the central government's regulations on this general rule are too detailed and the restrictions are too strict, so that the localities have no room for freedom and flexibility, it will inevitably lead to trimming the feet to fit the shoes, and it will be difficult to meet the actual needs of the localities. Now, based on what I have seen and heard, I will select a few points that have a greater relationship and analyze them below as a framework for research and for the reference of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>First, the interpretation of the law. The Constitution has clear provisions for local autonomy in provinces and counties: "Provinces may convene provincial representative assemblies to enact provincial autonomy laws in accordance with the provincial and county autonomy general rules... (Article 112)" "Counties may convene county representative assemblies to enact county autonomy laws in accordance with the provincial and county autonomy general rules... (Article 122)" "Cities (provincially administered cities) shall apply the provisions of counties." (Article 128) It can be seen that the Constitution has clearly stipulated the three levels of local autonomy of provinces, cities, and counties within the provincial system, but the municipalities directly under the central government, which should first implement autonomy, seem to be regarded as secondary by the central government. According to Article 118 of the Constitution, "The autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law." What does the so-called law refer to? Article 170 of the Constitution specifies: "The law referred to in this Constitution means the law passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President." Based on the above laws and regulations, the meaning is very clear; although the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government does not specify that it is based on the general rules of autonomy for municipalities directly under the central government, municipalities directly under the central government should also have general rules of autonomy as the basis for the autonomy law, which is obvious. Because the general rules of autonomy must be passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President, it is the so-called law. The general rules of autonomy are laws, which is in line with Article 118 of the Constitution, which states: "The autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law," and there is no doubt about it. Unexpectedly, the Executive Yuan recently passed the draft general rules of provincial and county autonomy and sent it to the Legislative Yuan. Article 31 of Chapter 8, Supplementary Provisions, states: "According to Article 118 of the Constitution, the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law, but the autonomy laws of the respective cities may be drafted with reference to these general rules and submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for enactment." This is obviously a misunderstanding of the phrase in the Constitution "The autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government shall be determined by law" as meaning that the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government must be enacted by the Legislative Yuan, so there is a provision for submitting it to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for enactment. Moreover, the Legislative Yuan felt that the autonomy law was enacted by the central government, which clearly deprived the local legislative power, so it made a compromise, first drafted by the local government, and then transferred to the Legislative Yuan for enactment by the Executive Yuan, so that both parties could be taken care of. I do not know that if this law is established, it will be like leaving a huge stain in the history of Chinese constitutional governance, causing a serious trauma to Chinese democratic politics, which is absolutely unacceptable in law and reason! The people of ordinary counties and cities can still set their own autonomy laws and retain their local legislative power. Why can't the people of municipalities directly under the central government set their own autonomy laws and lose their local legislative power? Does the central government think that the economic and industrial development and the level of cultural education of the people of ordinary counties and cities are better than those of municipalities directly under the central government? Or does the central government still have differential treatment for the implementation of civil rights? If so, how can it explain itself in Article 7 of the Constitution: "All citizens of the Republic of China are equal before the law"? It is very clear that it relies on the true meaning of the Constitution. Moreover, since local autonomy is permitted, the central government can only formulate a general rule of autonomy in accordance with the Constitution and issue it to the local government, so that it can formulate local autonomy laws accordingly. There is no way to permit autonomy on the one hand and deprive it of its autonomy's legislative power on the other. May I ask if the local autonomy's legislative power is exercised by the central government, can it still be called local autonomy? If the local government cannot be autonomous, can what the central government does still be called constitutional governance? According to the actual examples of the development of civil rights in various countries in the world, local autonomy has developed from cities to rural areas. Because of the development of economy, culture, and transportation in cities, the complexity of industrial and commercial organizations and social interactions, and the advancement of public affairs, the need for the concept of freedom and autonomy is more intense and profound than in rural areas. Now, turning the cart before the horse, reversing the importance, it is difficult for wise people to understand!</p>
<p>Second, the implementation procedure. The implementation procedure of local autonomy is clearly stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction. If this procedure is strictly followed, the central government will not be able to convene the National Assembly, cannot agree on the Constitution, and cannot elect the President. In other words, it cannot implement constitutional governance immediately. The procedure stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction is from bottom to top, not from top to bottom; first, county autonomy must be implemented, and then provincial autonomy is implemented when more than half of the counties in the province have achieved autonomy; when more than half of the provinces in the country have achieved complete autonomy, then the National Assembly is convened to formulate the Constitution and elect the President, and constitutional governance is completed. Now, the central government convened the National Assembly, formulated the Constitution, and elected the President without waiting for the completion of county autonomy and provincial autonomy, because there are special relationships in domestic politics and special agreements between political parties, so it did not hesitate to end political tutelage and begin constitutional governance first. The procedural issue has now been abandoned in the past, and should not be raised in the future, otherwise, how can the central government explain itself for implementing constitutional governance without following the procedure? However, the Executive Yuan recently passed the draft general rules of provincial and county autonomy and sent it to the Legislative Yuan. Chapter 2 suddenly stipulates the implementation procedure. Article 6 states: "A county shall implement county autonomy when it has completed the following items: (1) The police and security are well-handled, (2) The finances are well-organized, (3) The household registration is well-handled, (4) The land registration is completed." What a strange article! Regardless of whether the so-called "well-organized," "completed," and "well-handled" meet this standard in the thousands of counties in the country, even in Shanghai, who dares to say that Shanghai's police and security, finances, household registration, and land registration have reached a state of completeness, perfection, and no regrets, and are qualified to implement autonomy? Moreover, this standard must be assessed by the supervisory authority, and the higher-level authority has room for arbitrary flexibility and free approval or rejection. The desire for local autonomy to be implemented throughout the country is like waiting for the Yellow River to clear, which is tantamount to the central government's jealousy of local autonomy! Commentators say that the central government's opening up of local civil rights is like liberating slaves, and the old man is not at ease. Can the central government not need procedures for itself, while the local government must have procedures? Moreover, the constitutional governance procedure set by the National Father is from bottom to top, but the central government has changed it to from top to bottom. Is there a need to revise the National Father's teachings? For decades, China has been accustomed to the bad habits of central centralization. The central government always grabs everything in its hands. Even for purely local affairs, the central government controls it for fear of not being tight enough. As a result, local governments have all become affiliated agencies of the central government, with small powers and incompetence. Their inability to develop freely and make achievements is also inevitable. Moreover, because civil rights are not thoroughly opened up, the people are also indifferent to politics. Ambitious people take the opportunity to resist, spread heresies in the localities, and act arbitrarily. One person calls out at night, and rioters rise up everywhere. It can be seen that the method of strengthening the trunk and weakening the branches is suitable for the past, but not necessarily for the present. There is absolutely no way to establish a country with the loss of people's centripetal force. Even the rule of balanced power takes the rapid opening up of civil rights and the completion of autonomy as the main principles. Autonomy makes it easy to gather people's strength, while official rule makes it easy to disperse people's hearts. The gathering and dispersal of people's hearts and strength have a great impact on the country's governance and chaos. I deeply hope that the central government will look far ahead, broaden its mind, and cancel the restrictions of this procedure, so that the localities can quickly achieve autonomy, so as to help the pastoral peony green leaves.</p>
<p>Third, the limits of supervision. Of course, there must be higher-level supervisory agencies to handle local autonomy, and we have no objection to this. However, the functions of the supervisory agency should be based on guidance, and should not control the final decision-making power of local autonomy. Otherwise, it is still official rule rather than civil rule, and it is still central centralization rather than local balanced power. Article 13 of the draft general rules of provincial and county autonomy passed by the Executive Yuan states: "Provinces and counties shall not violate central policies and laws when handling local autonomy matters." The Constitution only stipulates that it shall not conflict with the Constitution and shall not conflict with laws, and does not say that the orders of higher-level agencies shall not conflict. The reason is that the Constitution was passed by the National Assembly and the laws were passed by the Legislative Yuan, so it is reasonable that they should not conflict. If the orders are not passed by the public opinion organ, they should not conflict. Then the local autonomous government is no different from an affiliated agency of the central government. What is the meaning of autonomy? Article 61 of the draft general rules of autonomy A proposed by the Ministry of Interior states: "Supervisory agencies at all levels of autonomy may take the following actions: (1) Review budgets, final accounts, work plans, work reports, and individual regulations related to the rights and obligations of the people. (4) For the central work of autonomy, they may make decisions on behalf of the local government, and may implement them on behalf of the local government when necessary." According to the explanation of the original plan, the Ministry of Interior also made this proposal in the local autonomy reform plan proposed at the second internal affairs meeting in the 21st year, so this plan is specially stipulated. I don't know that at that time it was still in the period of political tutelage, and there were no provincial and county councils established in various places. There was nothing wrong with the higher-level agencies reviewing and implementing on behalf of the local government. Now, during the constitutional governance period, elected councils at all levels will be established. How can the higher-level supervisory agencies still overstep their authority? Moreover, the aforementioned powers belong purely to the powers of the local councils. If the higher-level supervisory agencies can exercise them on their behalf, then the provincial and county councils can be dispensed with! For example, Article 18, Paragraph 3 of the draft general rules of autonomy for municipalities directly under the central government proposed by the Ministry of Interior states: "The organization of the municipal government shall be determined by the respective municipal governments according to the complexity of its affairs and its financial situation, and shall be submitted to the municipal council for resolution and submitted to the autonomous supervisory agency for approval and filing." The so-called approval is that the higher-level supervisory agency clearly retains the final decision-making power. No matter how the municipal government formulates it and no matter how the municipal council resolves it, as long as the higher-level agency says no, it will be completely overturned; its restriction on civil rights and obstruction of autonomy is extremely obvious. It can be seen that the remnant poison of central centralization is still hidden in the draft constitutional governance bill, which is extremely regrettable!

<h3 id="e45">French Premier Announces Policy Guidelines: Promote Firm and Peaceful Diplomacy; Marie's New Cabinet Wins Majority Support in Parliament <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] The Parliament is scheduled to vote on a motion of confidence for the new Premier Marie tonight. Based on the current situation, Marie can obtain the statutory majority of 311 votes and serve as Premier. The Socialist Party has announced that all its members will unanimously support him. In addition to Marie's own Radical Socialist Party, he can also obtain the support of most members of the Popular Republican Movement and the right-wing Republican Liberty Independent Republican Party. It is rumored that the position of new Foreign Minister will be filled by former Premier Schuman.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Radical Socialist Party leader Marie, who was appointed to form a cabinet, earnestly appealed to the National Assembly on the 24th to approve his new cabinet. The political program he presented to the Assembly focused on foreign policy, pointing out that France's foreign policy should be based on the principle of firmness without provocation. Observers believe that Marie's special emphasis on diplomacy and placing domestic issues in a secondary position is a deliberate action to make it easier for the Parliament to approve his organization.</p>
<p>Marie said, "France's position in Europe should always be careful not to engage in excessive provocation, but at the same time should maintain a firm stance. If I serve as the head of the new cabinet, I will implement a firm but non-provocative diplomatic policy. France's policy toward Germany should be based on the resolutions of the London Six-Power Conference. France is willing to allow Germany to regain its rightful place in Europe, but not at the expense of the interests of other European countries. I believe that the opportunity of the upcoming UN General Assembly in Paris in September should be fully utilized to resolve the German issue. Regarding Anglo-French relations, I believe that France must move forward hand in hand with Britain, so I unconditionally support the Anglo-French 50-year alliance treaty and advocate that establishing friendly relations with Britain is my main principle."</p>
<p>Amidst the jeers of Communist members and the applause of middle-party members, Marie stated after forming a coalition government of five major center and right-wing parties, he then mentioned domestic plans, mainly to consolidate the national industry so that France can be proud of its industrial capabilities. Stabilizing the currency value so that the position of the franc can be maintained for generations to come. Marshall Aid is worthy of France's gratitude, but France must still prepare to help itself so that it can be self-reliant after American aid expires and ceases. After his election, he will also hire domestic elders to organize a permanent government advisory committee, using their opinions to avoid the factors that have dragged down previous coalition cabinets. Regarding the rural elections to be held in October, he declared that he has decided to hold them as scheduled and will not postpone them.</p>

<p>[Our News] New York, 24th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall has ordered Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Smith to go to London to discuss the Berlin situation with American officials currently staying in England. Ambassador Smith is scheduled to depart from Moscow on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Washington diplomatic sources believe that the draft of the second note to the Soviet Union by the British, American, and French powers has been personally carried to London and Paris by Bohlen, Counselor of the State Department and expert on Soviet issues. Military Governor of the American Zone in Germany Clay is on his way back to Berlin from the United States. His special plane will take the route through Bermuda and the Azores Islands. One of Clay's gains from this trip to the United States is that the US government has promised to allocate a large number of Air Master planes to strengthen the airlift between West Germany and Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] The US government urgently summoned its highest-ranking military and diplomatic experts on Germany and the Soviet Union to Europe on the 24th to urgently discuss the Berlin crisis. This unprecedented move occurred just before the climax of the crisis. The Western allies will soon send another note to the Kremlin, which may open the door to four-power negotiations. The location of the US expert meeting has not yet been determined. Participants will include Marshall's top advisor on the Soviet Union Bohlen, General Clay, who met with Truman and Marshall in Washington, Ambassador Douglas to the UK, who is negotiating with the UK and France in London, Ambassador Smith to the Soviet Union, who was ordered to go to Berlin on the 23rd, and possibly Ambassador Murphy, Clay's political advisor. Bohlen's trip to Europe allows the three-power talks to be elevated to several levels and avoids the time-consuming exchange of telegrams across the Atlantic. This spring, Smith presented his famous letter to Molotov, which caused a great uproar. The drafter of this letter was Bohlen.</p>

This move would give the government sufficient time to conduct negotiations. Clay expressed optimism about the future when meeting with reporters. He quoted President Truman's opinion on the 22nd, saying that the chances of peace were very good. He dared to assert that no country wanted war, including the Soviet Union, and that those who engaged in robbery would cause war. He was confident that the Berlin dispute would be resolved in a way that would not lead to war.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Can the Soviet Union Launch a War? (Part Two) <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Cai Quansheng</p>
<p>The Soviet Union lacks a canal system with the vast capacity of transportation routes like those in Western Europe. It has no inland waterways, only a few large rivers, but for most of the year, these are frozen. Therefore, 83 percent of domestic transportation in the Soviet Union relies on railways. However, even in its industrial regions, the railway system is very incomplete. Its railway length is only equivalent to that of the United States in 1872, but it must serve a territory three times as large. The total length of railways in the Soviet Union is only 57,000 miles, while the United States today has 226,000 miles. Railway transportation is the first key to the Soviet economy, and it will hinder the progress of the Soviet Union in the coming years.</p>
<p>Even under the new Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will only build 4,500 miles of railways. The reason is that its pre-war railway network was concentrated in the west, which fell into the hands of the Nazis and was severely damaged, requiring reconstruction first. The Soviet Union is being forced to restore most of its railway equipment. Many old locomotives are in use, and various vehicles were confiscated from Germany and its vassal states.</p>
<p>We can learn more about the Soviet Union by studying its automobile industry. Like other industries, the Soviet automobile industry is state-owned and politically controlled, and it does not produce any basic cars. It imitates British and American vehicles, and there is generally nothing to change. Even so, the Soviet automobile industry is not developed.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's use of manpower tells us a lot about its potential to launch a war. A Moscow magazine, "Economic Issues," compared a Soviet power plant with a power plant in the southern United States. The two plants have the same output, but the United States only uses 51 people, while the Soviet Union needs 480 people. The American power plant has only 17 staff members, while the Soviet power station needs 91 people. Under the communist economic system, the Soviet Union needs 11 people to work to produce 1,000 kilowatts of electricity, but in the United States, only 2 people are needed.</p>
<p>The situation in coal production is equally obvious. In the United States, 90 percent of all coal mines are developed by machines, 60 percent are transported by machines, and only 4 percent are removed by hand. But in the Soviet Union, a large amount of coal is mined by hand.</p>
<p>Soviet coal mines, like other Soviet industries, are full of non-producers. A Swedish mining engineer who recently visited the Soviet Donbas coal region found that for every four slave laborers mining coal, there was a Soviet engineer, manager, technician, or political administrator supervising them. The number of Soviet people used to oppress laborers may even be greater than the number of workers in other countries. But in a communist economy, the productivity of slave labor cannot compare to that of free workers in a free economy.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has the most manpower in the world, second only to China and India, but the entire Soviet Union has only a small number of trained technical personnel. According to careful statistics, even by 1960, the Soviet Union's per capita productivity would be, at most, only half of the United States' per capita productivity 30 years ago.</p>

<h3 id="e59">The General Labor Union Plans to Eliminate Industrial Disputes; All Executive Directors Will Petition the Social Affairs Bureau Tomorrow Morning, Requesting Salary Calculation Based on Current Index <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union held a meeting of executive directors at 10:00 AM yesterday to address the current index dispute. Chairman Shui Xiangzhen first reported on the labor-management disputes arising from the change in the cost of living index to bi-monthly publication and the subsequent determination of salary standards by the evaluation committee. He then clarified his views and reasons regarding the realistic issues of the case, and discussions commenced immediately. During the meeting, participants spoke enthusiastically, and the following important resolutions were summarized: (1) Regarding the index issue, a further request will be submitted to the authorities to adopt the principle of calculating salaries based on the current index. (2) All executive directors will be appointed to visit Director Wu on Monday morning (26th) to petition, urging adoption and implementation as soon as possible to safeguard the livelihoods of workers.</p>
<p>The Director-General of the General Labor Union States Reasons</p>
<p>[Further News] After the General Labor Union passed a resolution yesterday requesting the government to calculate salaries based on the current index, the Director-General of the Union, Shui Xiangyun, explained the reasons to reporters, stating that the General Labor Union previously reported, based on reports from various industrial unions, that prices have recently skyrocketed, and the index is out of sync with prices. Calculating salaries based on the previous month's index would result in significant losses for workers and make it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the Union decided on several comprehensive measures to request the government to adopt and implement. In terms of fundamental solutions, a new household survey will be conducted. In terms of immediate solutions, prices will be surveyed every Tuesday and Friday, and the index will be published twice a month, etc. All proposals have now been approved and implemented by the government, and we deeply appreciate the authorities' care for workers. However, the General Labor Union's proposal to publish the index twice a month was intended to ensure that workers in the city receive two salary payments per month and can enjoy the right to have their salaries calculated based on the current index. For example, the worker index for May was 337,000 times, for June it was 710,000 times, and for the first half of this month it was 1,380,000 times. The dramatic increase in each index is often doubled. Therefore, if salaries are still calculated based on the previous period's index, the difference between wages and prices will be too great. Not only will the publication of the index twice a month not be beneficial, but it will also be detrimental and contrary to the original intentions of the Union's request and the government's bi-monthly publication of the cost of living index.</p>
<p>Hoping for Support from Employers</p>
<p>Since the publication of this period's index, disputes over salary calculations have arisen repeatedly. Although the evaluation committee has determined standards and methods, the rapid daily fluctuations in prices continue to affect the livelihoods of workers. Even if there are agreements in various industries to follow their customary agreements, it can be said that they are no longer timely. Given the current reality, workers, compelled by their livelihoods, cannot continue to abide by agreements or customs and disregard their actual living conditions. The Union, standing from the perspective of labor, must make this statement. While we understand that employers in various industries are also bearing significant burdens, we have no other choice. We deeply hope that employers will understand the difficulties of the times, strive to support us, and overcome the difficulties together, he said.</p>

The preparatory committee resolved to request the Paper Industry Association to supply paper at a reasonable price as much as possible. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan recently decided to abolish the Municipal Industry and Commerce Guidance Office in order to save on the budget. However, the industrial community in the city unanimously believes that the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has indeed contributed to the development of the city's industry. Therefore, it was decided that the Industrial Association will submit a request to the central government to retain the organization of the Municipal Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to continue its guidance work.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Viewing the Yangtze River's Power from the Great Flood of the 20th Year of the Republic <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Kang Feng</p>
<p>The fate of three-quarters of the Yangtze River region hinges on future water levels; if there is news of the upper reaches stopping rising, half its vitality can be preserved.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuhu, Twenty-Second of This Month] This spring's rainfall has been particularly heavy, causing the long-dry Yangtze River to fill up with water very early. During the summer flood season, the melting snow from the mountains of western China flows into the river. The snowfall was exceptionally heavy last winter, rushing into the river and adding summer floods to the spring floods. Coupled with the exceptionally large amount of summer rainfall, the Yangtze River's water level is like the yang energy of a typhoid patient, with the high fever almost spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>From the Great Flood of the 20th Year of the Republic onward, the Yangtze River basin has enjoyed annual harvests for seventeen years, even during the ten years of the War of Resistance. Although its brother, the Yellow River, changed course at Huayuankou for ten years, leaving thirty million farmers in the southeastern Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces without a roof over their heads, the Yangtze River uniquely enjoyed good fortune. The reason why residents along the Yangtze River in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces were able to easily endure the ten years of suffering during the War of Resistance was largely due to the annual harvests.</p>
<p>This was also because the Yangtze River had less water and lower water levels for seventeen years. In addition, the Yangtze River embankment, which was abandoned after being repaired with funds from the American loan for cotton and wheat presided over by Song Ziwen in the 21st year of the Republic, restrained the river. People along the river relied on the river for sustenance, led by powerful figures. Poor farmers and disaster victims who were recruited as tenants provided labor to demarcate and build embankments and polders on the winter-exposed sandbars in the heart of the river and in the two major lakes, Dongting and Poyang, as well as various smaller lakes along the river in the four provinces. As a result, the lakes and swamps that originally accommodated the summer floods and the sandbars in the heart of the river became fertile new fields. These fertile lands were particularly productive. After the lakes and swamps were enclosed by embankments and polders, each mu (unit of area) of rice field yielded about eight dan (unit of volume) or more of rice. For example, the Tianyou Polder in Dongting Lake, which the people of Hubei insisted on creating, consistently harvested two million dan of rice annually from hundreds of thousands of mu of rice fields. Similarly, in Chen Yao Lake at the intersection of Tongcheng and Wuwei in Anhui after the war, the Pujji Reclamation Society reclaimed 250,000 mu of polder land. The 20,000 mu of polder land that had already been built last year had an output of 100,000 dan, a bumper harvest. After the successful construction of polders on the sandbars in the heart of the river, soybeans, sesame, and other miscellaneous grains could be sown, resulting in abundant harvests every season. This kind of "making the water give way" was an excellent remedy for increasing production and alleviating poverty. For seventeen years, local governments have refrained from interfering, and even some leaders have been involved in leading production increases. This was beneficial and harmless to the overall national economy in years with little water, but over time, the large and small lakes and sandbars that originally served as natural reservoirs for the Yangtze River have all become permanent farmland. The American loan reservoir of Dr. Savage in the Three Gorges area has not been started due to construction costs and time. Encountering the high water volume of this year's spring and summer floods, the Yangtze River, the hero who brought happiness to a hundred million people along the river for seventeen years, is roaring in the thunderstorm to tear apart the autumn harvest dream of a hundred million people this year. Not only has the natural reservoir defense line been breached this year, still serving as its reservoir, but it will also destroy the main embankments along the river, repeating the tragic situation of the 20th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Faced with such a flood volume, any water conservancy agency and water control expert are powerless. The Ministry of Water Resources' funding only allows it to distribute flood prevention equipment and materials to the provinces during normal years. For example, the 800 kilometers of the main embankment of the Yangtze River in Anhui received 70,000 sacks this year. If a 10-kilometer breach is destroyed, 70 million sacks will not be able to alleviate the emergency. Today, when the water level is as high as 11.25 meters (Wuhu water level on July 22), the Yangtze River embankment, which is only 13 meters high at the top, can only be guarded day and night by tens of thousands of farmers using their own bodies. On rainy and stormy nights, when the river waves crash against the shore, the farmers desperately shout and carry soil to fill any small breaches or cracks they discover in the river embankment. The sound of gongs directing the rescue effort beats tighter and tighter. It has been almost eight days since July 15 that the Anhui and Hubei sections of the Yangtze River have been guarding in this way, truly like the anxiety and worry of caring for a relative suffering from typhoid fever, fearing intestinal bleeding in the last few days!</p>
<p>People all know that the new and old polders of Dongting Lake have all been submerged. The consequences are concerning after the high water level in Chongqing on July 19 reaches Wuhan on the 22nd and 23rd. It is rumored in Hankou that the Ma Hua and Tongren embankments, which protect the northern shores of Hubei and Anhui, have been breached in seven counties, including Huangmei and Susong (the Yangtze River Works Office in Anhui has not yet received a report of the Ma Hua breach at this time). It appears that the Yangtze River's momentum has already caused a major disaster in July, but this has only made about a quarter of the river region uneasy. August and the last nine days of July are the decisive period for the rice fields in the remaining three-quarters of the river region. The rice fields are covered with ripening ears of rice, and they can be harvested in thirty days. If there is news of the Yangtze River's upper reaches stopping rising, the river region can still retain half its vitality. Let us closely watch this yellow river flow eastward!</p>

The company's current difficulties include the following: (1) Raw cotton problem. Because the cotton-producing areas have been reduced to bandit areas by the Communists, it is impossible to conduct in-depth purchasing. Those that have not fallen are also unable to purchase large quantities due to transportation difficulties, restrictions on the exit of cotton from various places, and farmers' insistence on trading in silver dollars. The method of exchanging yarn for cotton currently being promoted by the company has unknown results. In the past, the amount of foreign cotton received was relatively large, which could still maintain production, but now foreign aid has decreased, resulting in a large reduction in the company's raw cotton reserves. (2) Because the import of spare parts is under strict control, the spare parts of each factory cannot be replenished, which affects work efficiency. Moreover, due to insufficient supply of coal and electricity, most factories only partially operate. For example, in Yingkou and other places, the losses are very large due to the war, and the number of operating yarn spindles and cloth machines is small. (3) Supply of military uniform materials. The amount supplied is huge, and it is first traded and then priced, and the surplus is deducted from the payment, so the company suffers a great loss. The company's capital is limited, and it cannot bear the burden in the long run. (4) Rationing of cloth for government employees and teachers. Because the goods are delivered first and then priced, and the surplus is deducted from the payment in advance, the loss is large, worth about 22,000 dan of raw cotton. (5) Price stabilization sales. The company carried out price stabilization sales in coordination with government orders to stabilize the market price of yarn and cloth, but the loss was huge because the allocation price was much lower than the market price. The current improvement measures are first to replenish the raw cotton reserves. In addition to intensifying the purchasing work, it is planned to expand the method of exchanging yarn and cloth for cotton, and increase the amount of foreign sales to exchange for a large amount of raw cotton. For the distribution of military cloth, it is hoped that cash-on-delivery transactions can be implemented in the future. It is also hoped that the Executive Yuan will order all localities to protect the purchase and transportation of cotton; the supply of coal, electricity, and fuel should be given priority to Jianfeng factories because their supply to the military and civilians cannot be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Rice and Coarse Grains Are Weak, Flour and Cooking Oil Are Firm <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was weak due to the weakness of the market the day before and the low prices reported in Wuxi, which made people feel empty and tired. In addition, the rice shops' acceptance was quite dull, so the market opened with a drop of 1 million yuan, and the market became even weaker later. White japonica rice has retreated to 40 million yuan. In the Nanshi market, white japonica rice was 38.5 million yuan, and in the Beishi market, special high-quality japonica rice was 42 million yuan. Because the factory's acceptance was not strong, coarse indica rice retreated into the 30 million yuan range. The lowest price was 28.8 million yuan for bagged indica rice. Yesterday's arrivals were 1,539 dan in the Nanshi market and 1,449 dan in the Beishi market.</p>
<p>Flour prices had fallen significantly for several consecutive days, and the money market eased. The owners were not in a hurry to sell, while retail investors and actual sellers took the opportunity to buy. The market was buoyant. Lao Che flour once reached 12 million yuan and closed at 11.9 million yuan. Bingchuan flour opened very high and then fell to 10.8 million yuan at the close, with each rising by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

Sesame was taken in by Tianjin traders, and white sesame was priced at 50 million yuan, an increase of 3 million yuan. Raw peanuts were slightly weak at 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cooking oil market fluctuated and trended higher. At the beginning of the market, it was still hovering at the original price of the previous day, and the sales were not active. Soybean oil opened at 75 million yuan and once fell to 74.5 million yuan. However, as the money market eased, retail investors came to buy, and soybean oil finally traded at 77 million yuan, an increase of 2 million to 3 million yuan. Vegetable oil closed firmly. The price of vegetable oil in Jiji barrels opened in the central market and was still at the original price of the previous day. Small vehicle sesame oil rose by 1 million yuan, and the market was tight in the later market. Soybean cake was level at first and then firmed.

<p>Since the price of red and green tea has been continuously and fiercely set after production, the owners in this city have hoarded goods and raised prices, but the buyers are unwilling to rush to buy because the money market seems to be easing but is still tight, so the trading continues to be as sparse as the morning stars, and the process is unable to rise again. According to people in the industry, Zhenmei and other green teas, which were mainly sold to Africa in the past, are still favored there, but the prices offered are extremely stingy. The exporters have called overseas in the past few days to request an increase in tea prices, but they have not been approved so far. In this situation, the sales of Chinese tea to the Philippines are temporarily afraid that there will be no significant situation.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Two Trillion Sugar Cane Loan Handled and Paid by the China Farmers Bank <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of 300 billion has been remitted to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The two trillion yuan of sugarcane loan approved by the Four Joint Offices this spring has now been started by the China Farmers Bank. The allocated amount is 600 billion yuan in July and 700 billion yuan in each of August and September. The interest rate is 1.66%, and the term is 18 months. The first batch of funds has been allocated by the National Bank to the Agricultural Bank for 300 billion yuan. The Agricultural Bank commissioned the Bank of Taiwan to remit the funds to Taiwan Province on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of this month. According to the current exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender, which is 1 to 1257, it is only worth more than 238 million Taiwan dollars. Another 300 billion yuan (legal tender) will be remitted next week. When the remittance is due, Taiwan Sugar Corporation will hand over the combined currency to the Bank of Taiwan, and then convert it into legal currency for repayment, which will have to wait for the Four Joint Offices to approve. The above loan was approved in March, and at that time, the exchange rate could be converted into 18 billion Taiwan dollars. Later, due to the rise in the exchange rate, the current total loan amount is only worth 16 billion combined currency, which is too far from actual needs. The Taiwan Sugar authorities are deeply concerned that it will hinder increased production, and came to Shanghai a few days ago to consult with relevant authorities on how to handle it. It is reported that the shortfall will be borne by the Bank of Taiwan as much as possible. If the bank's capital is insufficient, it will be requested that the Four Joint Offices add additional funds. This issue must also be decided by the Four Joint Offices.</p>

The high price of the leading fine cloth was 50.5 million, and there was no transaction. The opening price in the court was 48.7 million yuan, but the sales of the merchants were affected by the stimulus of negative news, and they frequently came to sell.

(2) In addition to being able to purchase and use export exchange settlement certificates, importers can purchase and use overseas remittance exchange settlement certificates to offset imports.

<h3 id="e114">Beiping College Students Fleeing to Shanghai: Flock to Public Institutions, Private Schools, Except for the Best, are Ignored <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Beiping, 22nd, by airmail] Beiping has become a concentration point for college students fleeing from North China, and the problems of living and studying are very serious. Public schools that do not charge tuition fees and have public funding are overwhelmed with applications during the summer enrollment period, with an average of one person being admitted for every 20 applicants. Private schools, except for those with outstanding performance, are mostly ignored, forming two extremes. The fate of these students who fail to get into public schools and cannot afford to attend private schools is particularly concerning. The number of applicants to Peking University and Tsinghua University this year is even greater than last year. The number of applicants in the six regions of Beiping and Chongqing has already been counted. Tsinghua University has 2,894 applicants in the Beiping region and over 800 in the Chongqing region (the total number of new students admitted is only 500). Peking University has 4,919 applicants in the Beiping region and 1,443 in the Chongqing region (the total number of admissions is only 400). In addition, the total number of applicants from Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Shenyang will be considerable. The tuition fees for private universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Beiping have not been determined in most cases this year. If the government cannot provide subsidies, they will be calculated based on the price of flour, and the number of out-of-school children will increase sharply at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Academic Institution Feature: 17. Nantong College <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>History</p>
<p>Nantong College has a history of 43 years. Its predecessor was the three specialized schools of agriculture, medicine, and textile founded by Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong. In the 18th year, the three schools merged and were approved by the Ministry of Education to change their name to the current name. During the Anti-Japanese War, Nantong was occupied, and the school moved to Shanghai in the autumn of the 27th year to resume classes. After the victory, it still returned to Nantong in stages in the 35th and 36th years. However, due to equipment, teaching, and other reasons, some of the agricultural and textile departments are still taught in Shanghai. Recently, as the order in northern Jiangsu has not yet been fully established, the school has decided to separate the school in Nantong and Shanghai instead of relocating and merging to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The school currently has three departments: agriculture, medicine, and textiles. The agricultural department has three departments: agronomy, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural economics. The textile department has two departments: textile engineering and dyeing and chemical engineering. The medical department does not have separate departments according to the regulations of the medical college. The entire school has more than 160 faculty and staff members and more than 900 students, with a distribution ratio of approximately four to one between Nantong and Shanghai. The school also regards the three departments of agriculture, medicine, and textiles as practical application disciplines, so the affiliated businesses of each department are extremely complete. The agricultural department has a farm, a livestock farm, and an agricultural product processing farm. The agricultural area in the Nantong campus is only about 100 acres. In addition, there are 700 acres of cotton fields and 120,000 acres of land to be reclaimed in the coastal area. Unfortunately, due to transportation obstacles, they have not been used since the victory. The medical department has an affiliated hospital with 150 beds and more than 30 doctors, which is sufficient to serve as the central hospital in the coastal and riverine areas of northern Jiangsu. The textile department has three factories: a practice textile factory, a weaving factory, and a dyeing and finishing factory. The textile factory is currently in operation, and the other two factories are being renovated.</p>
<p>Enrollment</p>
<p>The school will enroll new students in all departments and will also accept transfer students. New students must have a high school diploma or equivalent qualifications. Transfer students must have transfer certificates from equivalent classes. Both male and female students are accepted. The examination subjects and application procedures are similar to those of general universities. The registration dates are August 5th to 7th, and the examination dates are August 9th and 10th. The locations are in Shanghai and Nantong. The Shanghai location is at 270 Chongqing North Road.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] Chinese 10,000-meter long-distance champion Lou Wenao practiced at the Ockesbridge World Games venue today. Many spectators believe that Lou is the most prominent figure in the Chinese World Games delegation. Lou did not show any amazing performance when starting in practice, but reporters believe that Lou is not without possibility of scoring at this conference based on his past records. Lou and his sparring partners usually wear running shoes and are in good spirits during recent practice. He shares a room with Taiwanese athlete Chen Yinglang and practices together. However, Lou's recent unofficial practice results are not unusual because he has never faced a real game. Local sports observers believe that he will make great progress and is undoubtedly the most promising scorer for China at this World Games. In addition, the Chinese World Games basketball team lost to the lesser-known Egyptian team with a lopsided score of 67 to 40 in a practice match yesterday, which was "surprising". The Egyptian team has only four years of experience, but after applying American coaching, they showed the latest style of play and were very accurate in shooting. The Egyptian team had previously played a practice match with the Korean basketball team. The Chinese basketball team is scheduled to play several games before the official opening of the World Games on July 29.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch] In the senior women's softball league hosted by the International Sports Association, the two winning teams, Randeng and Jiaolian, will play the championship game of the first week at the racecourse at 4:30 p.m. today. Since the beginning of the season, Randeng has won five games, and Jiaolian has defeated six opponents in a row. The former has Cheng Mulan's pitching, Wu Hanyun's catching, and Lin Jingyi and Cai Baoqiu's batting. There is a deep tacit understanding between the infield and outfield. Last season, they overpowered the group with a swift offensive and won the Shanghai Open Women's Softball Championship. Jiaolian has gathered the elite of foreign players, with abundant strength but insufficient strategy. However, the team's fighting spirit is very strong, and they will give their all in every game. In terms of strength, Randeng is indeed better, but in terms of spirit, if Randeng's players cannot unite as one and fight against the enemy together, Jiaolian will have no hope of winning the championship. Randeng's lineup for today's game is as follows:</p>
<p>Pitcher Cheng Mulan, catcher Wu Hanyun, first base Xu Aizhen, second base Lin Jingyi, third base Cai Baoqiu, shortstop Shen Shuwei, center field Yin Yiguan and Li Guanjin, left field Guo Zhichang, center fielder Zhang Luoluo, Shen Yiqi, right field Tang Xiaoyu.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Due to the recent unpredictable weather, which has affected the progress of the league, the International Sports Association is now considering canceling the second round of matches. If so, the sea queen of softball will be produced in today's battle.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Save the Parents! <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>Nowadays, people often point out certain malpractices in the education sector, invariably saying, "Save the children." However, they don't realize that parents have genuinely reached a point where they desperately need saving.</p>
<p>In today's world, with the newly issued large-denomination banknotes and the disastrous fall in the value of the legal tender (fapi), the people's faith in fapi has already been severely shaken. Yet, the owners of schools of all levels openly took the lead in advocating that tuition fees should be calculated based on the price of several dan (a unit of dry measure) of white rice. This is clearly and directly striking a blow against the credibility of fapi—and so far, there has been no sign of any action taken by the education authorities to stop this.</p>
<p>Not only are they not stopping it, but they are also adding fuel to the fire!</p>
<p>Please see the education section of this newspaper on the 22nd. The Municipal Education Bureau is again uniformly stipulating the uniforms for students in secondary schools in this city. "Senior boys are to wear Zhongshan suits, and girls are to wear qipao (cheongsam). Junior boys and girls are all to wear Boy Scout uniforms... The colors for spring and summer are light yellow, and for autumn and winter, evergreen." Reading this kind of news truly makes one feel like both laughing and crying! What day is this? The people's livelihood is declining, industry and commerce are in recession, and the salaried class is already on the verge of not being able to afford even simple meals. They've barely managed to get their children to have one old set of clothes to wear, and that's considered good enough. But now, after crossing the high threshold of the school gate that is "measured in rice," they have to taste the flavor of this "officially designated" axe! Each student has to add two sets of clothes. How much money will that cost? The young masters and misses from wealthy families may still complain that this kind of uniform is too "tidy" and demeans their noble status. But in this time and place, just how many young masters and misses from wealthy families are there? I don't know if the municipal education authorities have time to read the newspaper on weekdays, but if they did, they shouldn't forget that recently, there have been rice-grabbing riots in places like Wuxi and Ningbo! Today should be a time of pioneering work and painstaking management. To show achievement, there's no need to focus solely on superficial displays. If these superficial displays didn't harm the common people, it would merely indicate the leisurely pursuits of officials, and it would only mean that official documents would go through a few more rounds. It could also keep a few underfed and not-quite-starving junior civil servants alive. What's hateful is that when it comes to official matters that increase the burden on the people, these documents often travel with extraordinary speed. Therefore, we cannot help but worry and express our concern.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what's the benefit of middle school students wearing uniforms? Neatness? Beauty? If it were a time of peace and prosperity, when people had enough food and clothing, then talking about neatness and beauty would be fine. But now, it's different. If there are still people closing their eyes and shouting about neatness and beauty, then that person, if not mentally ill, is quite comparable to the Jin Dynasty's Emperor Hui.</p>
<p>Moreover, the waste of materials from students suddenly having to make new clothes when they already have clothes to wear is quite considerable. Didn't we expend tremendous effort to transport cotton from the United States? Materials are so scarce that we should cherish how they are used! Why should we massively consume them in places where we can save? If we speak harshly, in the current situation, deliberately wasting materials like this is simply sabotage, that is, intentionally or unintentionally assisting the rebellion!</p>
<p>Today's urgent task is to strive for social stability. To have social stability, we must avoid unnecessarily increasing the burden on the people. It's already difficult enough for students to enter the school gates. Can't we just stop with uniforms and the like? At this time of scorching heat, the esteemed gentlemen of the Education Bureau should take turns walking around the vicinity of the Pierre Apartments at the northern end of Zha Pu Road Bridge to see more of the emaciated refugees. Perhaps it can cure their "heatstroke."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Feicheng Peach <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuying</p>
<p>The Feicheng peach is a specialty of Feicheng County in Shandong. The peach is yellow in color, has a recessed tip, a round and small pit, and a sweet taste. The large ones weigh more than half a pound and are sold in large commercial ports such as Pingjin at a high price. Today, those sold on the market that are green in skin and have a small, pointed tip are mostly counterfeit products. When I was a guest in Feicheng, my friend Mr. Liu often gifted them to me, so I was able to taste the delicious flavor of this peach often. The peaches produced in the two or three peach orchards within the city are considered to be the true variety. Those produced within thirty li (a Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters) of the city are also called Feicheng peaches, but the taste is slightly inferior. Every early autumn, peddlers carrying loads on their shoulders come in an endless stream along the road. It is a pity that not all the peaches they are selling are Feicheng peaches. Many villagers plant peaches as their livelihood. I have visited each garden in the city and found that the trees are not very large, but the peaches are abundant and the branches and leaves are very lush. Everything relies on manual cultivation. Each main branch is made to develop in a balanced way, and almost all the side branches are fruiting branches. All branches affected by disease and insect pests are completely pruned away. At the time of pruning, the number of fruits is determined according to their age. When the flowers are budding, they are most afraid of fog. Several piles of wheat straw are always placed under the peach trees. Whenever there is heavy fog at dawn, the straw is set on fire, and the smoke rises halfway to the sky to ward off the fog. When the spring is deep and the flowers are blooming, the gardeners are very diligent in their care, because breaking off one flower means damaging one peach, and one branch of flowers would damage an unknown number of peaches. There have been cases of lawsuits arising from breaking off flowers. When picking peaches, a cloth bag is attached to a pole. When the peaches are seen to be ripe in color, they are picked with the pole, and the peaches fall down the pole and are caught by the bag.</p>
<p>All the gardens enshrine peach deities, and incense and offerings are provided. No one dares to disobey, because it is said that offending the deity will cause the peaches to fall overnight, leaving only the pits with the flesh removed and the tips facing upwards. This is merely superstitious talk.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Wonderful Method for Eliminating Mosquitoes <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Cangyu</p>
<p>During World War II, a place in India was plagued by disability. The British army tried hard to carry out preventive work, but they were never able to eliminate the malaria mosquitoes.</p>
<p>When the American army doctors arrived in India, they came up with a method. It turned out that mosquitoes rely entirely on emitting ultrasonic waves that are inaudible to the human ear to attract the opposite sex for courtship. The American army doctors set up many sound-emitting machines in the wilderness, broadcasting sound waves of the same frequency as female mosquitoes to attract male mosquitoes and exterminate them. Although most of the mosquitoes that bite people are females, once the number of male mosquitoes is reduced, the female mosquitoes are unable to reproduce offspring, and a dangerous outbreak of malaria gradually subsided in this way.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Psychology of Movie Fans <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>After watching a movie, or when friends get together to chat, in addition to discussing the plot, the beauty, charm, generosity, and elegance of the movie stars are invariably brought up. You may like star A, while he loves star B. Perhaps you will argue about the excellence of "your own star" and become red in the face?</p>
<p>There are reasons for our different preferences and admiration for stars. Upon careful examination, it is not without cause. However, many of our psychological activities are unconscious, which is what is called "subconscious" activity. Why one prefers a certain star is also a type of "subconscious" activity.</p>
<p>The basic principle for liking stars of the same gender (that is, men looking at male stars, or women looking at female stars) is "liking those who are similar to oneself." Whether it is in physique, appearance, personality, or posture, in whole or in part, or even just in some small habits, it will arouse our goodwill and preference. For example, those who like sports are particularly fond of stars with strong physiques; those who speak gently are particularly fond of gentle and elegant stars; tall and thin people like tall and thin people; lively people prefer lively people; those with bright eyes and white teeth especially like long eyelashes and big eyes... One can infer other instances from this.</p>
<p>The reasons for admiration and liking of stars of the opposite gender are more difficult to explore, because our subconscious is more complicated. Ms. Hilary Lynn of the United States has analyzed the preferences of American women for male stars and came to some conclusions. Female movie fans in our country may wish to compare her conclusions with your personality to see if she is right.</p>
<p>If you admire Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, "Tarzan" Weissmuller, etc.—you are one who enjoys being dominated by men, and you are willing to be conquered by strong men. You like decisive, resolute, and heroic men. You also like him to pursue you single-mindedly and regardless of everything.</p>
<p>If you admire Ronald Colman, Charles Boyer, etc.—you like things that are mysterious. You like to hear other people's secrets, and you also hope that others will confide their secrets to you, and you also like others to explore your secrets. This kind of man, with a composed and reserved attitude and a strong sense of self-confidence, although his emotions seem rather indifferent, is provocative to you! He can make you willing to use all your strength to pursue him, even if it means being crushed to pieces.</p>
<p>If you admire James Stewart, Kenny Baker, etc.—you want to dominate men. You pity the weak. This kind of obedient, childish man, although clumsy and shy, is enough to arouse your maternal love.</p>
<p>If you admire Leslie Howard, Tyrone Power, Cary Grant, etc.—you like elegant, gentle, sensitive, idealistic, and extremely romantic lovers. His love is pure and noble, and he is willing to obliterate himself and sacrifice everything for love. But you have not met such a man in real life, and probably will not in the future. He is the lover in your dream world.</p>
<p>If you admire Robert Taylor—you like change, are good at socializing, and your personality is unpredictable. You are one who wants to dominate men.</p>
<p>If you admire Bing Crosby, Robert Montgomery, Fred Astaire—you like cheerful, muddle-headed, and witty young men. You love to manage men and dominate men.</p>
<p>Bits and Pieces: Every time a representative of the United Nations makes a speech for one hour, the work of the staff in translating, recording, organizing... etc. requires as many as 388 "man-hours" (that is, 388 people working simultaneously for one hour; if one person works, it will take 388 hours).</p>
<p>Britain has newly invented a "wall-mounted radio," which looks exactly like a world map and can be hung on the wall. If you want to listen to the broadcast from Radio Paris, you just need to insert a light bulb in the place on the map marked "Paris" and you can receive it very clearly. If you want to listen to the broadcast from London, just insert the light bulb in the place on the map marked "London." Another new trick in Britain is that radios can also be installed on bicycles, just like in cars.</p>
<p>In recent years, the United States has been actively developing Alaska. The initial motivation was to strengthen national defense, but unexpectedly, people who migrated there discovered gold mines, so the number of people requesting to go there increased sharply. And when mining, they even unearthed a large number of fossils and prehistoric relics, which are very valuable, and the residents' profits tripled.</p>
<p>Whenever members of Congress receive letters from people in their electoral districts inquiring or making suggestions, they always reply to every letter. Therefore, the government specifically gives senators a postage subsidy of US$105 per person per year, and representatives a postage subsidy of US$75 per person per year.</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Supervising the mint was never a cold official, one can pity the scholar who spits on his official hat in the alley. In time, the grass will be green and the fire of Mount Li will burn, and I fear the phosphorus will be so much that the land will not be wide. (Mount Li Palace)</p>
<p>Torn clothes and rotten millet, sharp spears and halberds, the worries of the jade tent have not yet disappeared, twice passing the tomb, most of the wild contracts, even now, the evening atmosphere fills Fangtou. (Biography of Zhao Kuo)</p>
<p>Words of kindness on paper cannot save the disaster, the hearts of the people are like water and are difficult to call back, dividing the fields and distributing the grain must be planned from the beginning, why begrudge heroes from acting like flattering talents? (Luntai Edict)</p>
<p>The newly made transport wheels descend the slope, the sun shines brightly in Chang'an over the fading spring, five thousand officials are fed by the dew from the golden plate, national talents mostly look up at the sky. (Dew Receiving Plate)</p>

<p>— Yushou</p>
<p>Xue Yanqin</p>
<p>Among contemporary celebrities whose alias is "Yongkuan," besides Weng Wenhao and his relative by marriage Zhang Shouyong (deceased), there is also the old Beijing opera actress Xue Yanqin. (Xue's real name is Huang Yongni.) Weng and Zhang's affairs are neither worth writing about nor necessary to write about, but Yanqin's experiences, if condensed, could make for a long novel of a million words, truly a tragic character in the style of Thomas Hardy.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, there were four actresses in Beijing whose voices were most famous, and who were political figures on the "era of the replacement of Li and Cao," Yanqin was one of them. The other three were Qin Xuefang, Bi Yunxia, and Jin Shaomei, and Yanqin was the youngest. This summer, I traveled to Beiping and obtained a photo of Yanqin in ordinary clothes taken in Taiyuan at a deserted stall near Xuanwu Gate. She is holding a brush in a scribbling pose, with countless books on leather bindings placed next to her. This woman studies opera but her nature is close to literary matters, hence this simulated work. At that time, among the four actresses, Bi Yunxia's life was the most chaotic. Qin Xuefang and Yanqin practiced Islam, and their lives were relatively purified, but Xuefang was arrogant and stubborn, not as lively and adaptable as Yanqin.</p>
<p>In the past ten years or so, Yanqin married Pu Kuang, the younger brother of Ji Yi, and once lived with him in Tokyo. Although Kuang was a playboy and did not engage in production, he never sided with Zhan Yi. After the July 7th Incident, cultural figures who fell into the hands of the Japanese often used Kuang's house as a gathering place for banquets, secretly discussing escape. Someone shielded Guo Dingtang's escape, and the plan was first made in Kuang's residence. The creation of this situation and atmosphere was due to Yanqin's fondness for interacting with literary and artistic people, not because Kuang truly had such clear vision.</p>
<p>Before long, Yanqin returned to Beiping with Pu Kuang. Kuang no longer had permanent assets and relied on eating away at Yanqin's remaining wealth to live. He then had an affair with a drummer, and they divorced the year before last. At this point, Yanqin only had two small houses left, and she received only a few bags of flour in rent each month. Yanqin is over forty years old, but her demeanor is handsome and elegant, and her hair shines like lacquer. She lives next door to the novelist Zhang Henshui, and can paint simple flowers, people call her "Mrs. Huang."</p>

<p>— Chen Ye</p>
<p>When the war started in the 26th year, some people only had some black whiskers. A year or two later, by the time of victory, their beards and hair had completely turned white. One of my neighbors was like that. Some people were just big kids, a year or two later, after eight years, they had completely lost the shadow of childhood. I am like that. During the war, people's years were spent only in pitiful waiting and hoping. After eight years, people began again to pitifully hope and wait. A year or two, the young people will gradually grow old.</p>
<p>The days are gray and white, even if the body has not aged, people's hearts are also aging and withering. On a rainy morning, I took a rickshaw out and passed through two rather quiet streets and saw a young couple walking towards me, showing colors of worry. Although I don't know what they were worried about, most of it must be about money, life, and marriage. I think it is so. Today's young people are an unfortunate generation. I haven't seen anyone showing the colors of youthful joy and vitality for a long time. Young people do not have the joy of youth. I rarely go to the cinema now, the ticket prices are too expensive. Once I saw a colorful film in Suzhou, the movie showed the abundant trees and fields, the wide and flat highway on the other side of the Pacific, the crystal blue sky, and the beautiful sunlight. I felt that such beautiful sunshine had not been seen in our lives for a long time. It seems that our life is mostly overcast.</p>
