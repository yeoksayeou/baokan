<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕立法院第一會期第十次會議，十二日全日舉行，孫院長主席，繼續對行政院翁院長施政方針報吿進行質詢，翁氏及各部會首長仍全日坐於主席台兩側靜聽，並隨時記錄要點。午前立委發言及提出書面意見奢計二十四人，大多仍指責翁氏報吿無重心，空洞而不切實際，難以應付當前緊急局面。王寒生，劉博崑等質問政府對北方之動搖有無緊急措施？劉氏並謂，翁內閣缺乏個性，避重就輕，爲事務性的內閣甚至是官僚內閣，倘仍不對全民負責，而祗對少數人或一個人負責，非垮不可。北方危局實監因於外交失敗，忽略國際影響，以至從根本錯起。加以軍事將領腐化，當然戰事失利，今後旣云戡亂，即不能不注意根本之政治問題，堅定顯明之外交及廉能之軍政，實爲爭取人民士兵信心所必需，主政者應負起責任。邵華質詢地方行政長官不良何不撤換？究是人民胡鬧抑政府顢預？鄧公玄，馮均璉，祁志厚均提出何時改革幣制之問題，馮氏要求政府公布發行額及彌補赤字辦法。祁志厚，余拯，相菊潭，馮均璉等皆責問加强軍事有何具體辦法？軍隊之補充及獎懲是否仍祇顧及派系而不論功過？扶助及訓練地方武力，究有如何辦法？祁氏並謂，蘇聯資助匪軍，證據確鑿，政府有無對策？今日局面內憂外患不一而足，政府爲何無全盤辦法？程滄波質詢爲何特別預算竟無數目？武和軒謂，國防軍事究係部長負責抑總長負責？行新政何以不用新人？羅衡靑問國人國外存款何以越來越多？政府有無辦法徽用，江一平對此，主張可在國外循司法手續進行調查，甚至沒收，以匡外交不逮。渠並指責施政報吿爲何竟將司法行政一項遺漏？希望有周詳具體之施政辦法，隨預算案提出立院。吳鑄人質詢人事政策何以不曾提及？劣跡昭彰如張嘉璈流豈可再用？江一平·李鈺均贊成十一日孫桂籍所提就業重於救濟及裁員之意見，李氏並謂，美援運用委會機構龐大，是否要蹈「善後救濟總署」覆轍？黃元彬謂，加强戡亂及穩定經濟爲兩大要務，政府應努力將方針所提供之目的實現。</p>

<p>午後續有發言質詢及提出書面意見者約廿餘人，楊一舉·劉雲昭·張道行·吳望伋等就加强軍事提出意見，詢以有無辦法澄淸役政。張·吳兩氏並主取銷征兵·征糧，以免擾民。張金鑑謂，報吿所懸目標甚好，然有無魄力實現，執行進度如何，渠指出，過去施政失敗，由於集權太甚，機構敗壞，新政府有無決心分權到地方，能否把破機器改良簡化？劉明揚·劉士篤復責問有何辦法制止通貨膨脹，挽救行將崩潰之經濟。陳紫楓稱：旣云革新，即不能因循，新政府對中央及地力官員不稱職應懲處或撤換者，是否仍可不管？鄭彥棻則以爲將施政方針作施政計劃或結果批評，似失之過早，渠就行憲方面提出意見，謂憲法地方制度規定過少，應早準備實施細節計劃，並注意各種地方制度所需選舉之妥善進行辦法。渠詢以政府究擬於何時完成憲法第十一章所定地方政制之建立？李雲良質問新政府對爭取日本賠償有何計劃？是否準備貨款扶植民營航業？席振鐸則指實施政方針中對邊政忽略。會議進行中，文羣提出臨時動議，以爲在此時局下，不能對尙無作爲之新政院過事苛責，主停止質詢，並即改開全院委會，將該力針盡兩日討論後，決定同意與否。孫院長當謂，依據議事規則，以行使同意權及審查預算者外，並無其他召開全院委會之規定，多數委員亦以對施政方針報吿之質詢，乃憲法所賦權利及議則規定程序，何可自動放棄，且議惟進行之中，更非提臨時動議時機，文氏意見乃被打消，會議至下午六時，孫院長報吿兩日來陸續收到之請求發言單及書面意見之編號達二二〇號，巳進行之口頭質詢，畫面宣讀及自動撤回者計一〇一號，尙有一一九號，當徵詢會衆意見，除書面意見七十三號逕送行政院請提出答覆外，餘要求口頭質詢者四十六號，決定十四日開第十一次會議，繼續進行，六時十分散會。</p>

<h3 id="c23">大學入學考試應有的改進 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 沈有乾</p>
<p>今日國內各大昌入學考試方法，頗有可以批評的地方。本年著做將近，各大學不久又將籌備一年一度的大學考試。這時討論改進方法，似乎並不太早。通行辦法受人指摘的地方與應當檢討可能改進的地方，不外乎以下三點：（一）缺乏組織，所以不經濟。（二）批分主觀，所以不正確。（三）題材呆板，所以不實用。茲分別討飾之。</p>
<p>第一，現行辦法怎樣不經濟，似乎巳是大衆週知的事實，不必詳細證明。每年夏天各大學舉行入學考試的時候，幾乎每一學生都是接連投考好幾處的。甲校尙未考畢，乙校又須報名，甚至奔走不同的城市，眞是勞民傷財之極！有時兩校在同一日期考試，顧此失彼，尤感遺憾無窮。而且考試結果揭曉之後，常有多數錄取者，因亦被他校錄取而永不報到，亦有已經報到者因又被他校錄取而重行退學。翻覆變化，紛亂無已。作者在戰前曾鼓吹各大學聯合招考，當時中央·武漢·浙江三大學即會試辦，此後也常有兩三校聯合辦理的。但迄今巳過十年，似乎未有顯著進步。查反對聯合招考的可能理由，可以分爲學校方面與學生方面考慮。在學校方面，各校情形不同，各有其傳統，各有其理想，各有其需要。獨辦可各行其是，不受他校牽掣。如聯合辦理，一部份學校對於他校敎授參加命題閱卷不很放心，另一部份學校則又恐優秀學生將儘先選擇他校，因此僅能取得次等學生。學生方面則除極少數確實優秀，對於考試有絕對把握者外，大多數難免心存僥倖，以爲多考幾次猶如摸彩多摸幾次，中獎機會較多。若聯合考試則近乎孤注一擲，將减少其升學機會。</p>
<p>學生方面反對聯合考試的可能理田，在現今考試結果不很正確的情形下，並非全無根據。祗須方法改進，成績完全決定於能力，不受不相干因子的影響，這種看法即可不攻自破。而且各大學錄取學生的名額總數是一定的，與中學畢業生總數的比例也是一定的，所以不論聯合招考處分別招考。錄取的頻率其實是相等的。除非分別考試因爲實復錄取而實際不能敷足名額，以致無形中减少了可貴的升學機會。如果這樣，聯合考試對於學生是有百利而無一弊的。</p>
<p>學校方面不願以招考之壽委諸他校，原是情理之常。但各校聯合招考時仍不妨保留一部份自由。例如各校除共同必考的學科外，某校可能另加特殊學科。一種學科內除共同必老的試題外，某校可能另加特殊的試題。及格的標準除共同的最低限度外，茶校可能另加特殊的條件。諸如此類的個別情形，應當無妨於全體合作。查美國的大學最自由，最不統一，最富有個性，但其合組的大學入學考試委員會非常發達，辦理各校入學老試極爲順利。中國的大學敎育家談論合作已多，這正是實際表現合作精神的機會。</p>
<p>聯合招考的最後目標應當包括全國大學。全國大學旣然都是遵照敎育部統一規定辦法的，全國聯合招考應當並無任何原則上的困難。但技術上也需經過相當訓練，初辦時範圍或者不必太大，以後可以逐漸合併。情形比較相同的學校可以先行聯合，各校代表商定基本原則，如應考學科，考試地點，經費的來源與支配後，即可聘請各學科的命題與閱卷委員，各地點的監試委員，分別籌備進行。任何學校如有特殊的學科或試題，各自決定後仍可於聯合考試中附帶辦理。學生報名時對於學校院系可以依次選擇，自第一志願塡起，不加限制，可能填至第十或甚至第二十志願。各校錄取標準不必一律，可自由伸縮。任何考生合乎第一志願校系之標準者即照第一志願錄取。第一志願未合標準者，再考慮其第二志願。依次類推，當無問題。如規模龐大，登記與檢查須立一簡便系統，暫時當尙無採用何婁立斯電機檢片方法的必要。</p>
<p>第二，現行辦法不正確。這當然不是絕對的。大概講起來，各校招考時優等生可能每考必取，而劣等生可能應考不取。所以遞行考試方法之足以辨別嬝優與最劣學生，尙屬可信與有敎。但中等生之錄取與否，我們不能不承認其並不完全決定於能力高下，而一部份是近乎監博籌負了。例如某校問級畢業生甲乙二人，平時甲優於乙，經長期比較，巳可確定，但投考大學時或乙取而田杏。這類案件，時有所聞。當然一部份的原因可能是考生本人的不穩定，如臨時會皇失措，以致成績反常。但考試方法的不正確，至少要負一部份責任。</p>
<p>現在大多數學校沿用傳統的論文式試題，絕少採用比較客觀的新式試題。論文式考試結果不能正確的最大原因是批分缺乏標準，一都份決定於種種偶然的因子。假設試卷數目不多，批分時間充足，這種偶然因子的影響原可减至最低限度。不幸入學考試受相反條件的控制，試卷至少數千，甚且數萬，須於數星期內批閔究竣。所以除了數學一類試題，性質比較客觀者外，偶然因子的影響非常嚴重。第一，因爲試卷多面時間短，不得不分給若干敎授批閱。各敎授寬嚴不齊，好惡有別。所以同一試卷如經秀干敎授批閱，所得分數可以大有出入。其次，同一敎授的標準，也不能始終不變。入學考試的試卷一天內決離批閱完畢，時間也不允許把批好的分數再加修正。一本批過的試卷，如於兩三天後時間一數授再批，除非第一次所批分數在試卷上或在記憶上留有痕迹，兩次分數也必不同，相差有時也很可觀。此外，一本試卷的位置或批閱次序也是決定其分數的重要因子。同一試卷，如放在若干本特別優異的卷子以後，便會相形見拙，損失幾分，如放在若干本特別惡劣的卷子以後，便似鶴立鷄羣，會多得幾分。</p>
<p>不過客觀考試方法，也有其弱點，也受人指摘，但在入學考試採用是絕對利多害少的。例如我們並不否認是非式與選擇式的試題可能憑空猜對，因之也受偶然因子的影響，但在題數相當多的時候，這種影響比了批分缺乏標準所引起的誤差是不足輕重的。不過客觀考試應當充分利用時間，預備多數題目，否則可能反比傳統方法更不正確。多年前曾見某大學某學科入學考試採用是非式試題，但試題祗有十個。考生讀這十個題目，鎮上十個正負符號，最慢的也不遮蔽了五分鐘，而規定的考試時關有兩小時之久，眞是太可笑了。於此不得不鄭重聲明，客觀考試的命題工作是很煩重的，絕不是幾分鐘內略加思索可以完成的。</p>
<p>對於客觀考試的另一批評是題目往往過分注重人名地名實名日期一類零星記憶，祗能適用於小學生，不足以選拔大學人才。這確是有些客觀考試的弱點，但並不是不可避免的。實際上客觀考試不限於零星節目，也不限於記憶力，更不根於某種程度，美國大學入學考試委員會積多年經騐與研究，除英文作文而外，現在已經全部採用客觀考試。客觀考試非但可以應用於高中畢業生，即應用於大學畢業生，亦並無困難。例如美國最著名的哈佛，耶魯，普林斯頓，哥侖比亞四大學所聯合舉辦的研究生考試也完全採用客觀試題。</p>
<p>作者在戰前曾試繼一種大學生的客觀考試材料，在浙大入學考試試用。其預測考生入學後成績的效果，與各學科舊式考試的總分不相上下。但壽式考試有七八門學科，每門學科佔兩小時，總計時間平均十五小時，而客觀考試所費時間不過九十分鐘，爲十與一之比。而且客觀考試因要避免與各學科考試重複，所用材料大部分在高中課程以外，近乎智力測騐。如果客觀試題也照各種學科取材，每們假定費一小時，即傳統考試時間的一半，其預測的力量一定可以增加不少。</p>
<p>第三，大學入學考試直接負選擇人才的責任，間接影響中學的敎材敎法。現今中國學校敎育有一普遍的基本的弊病，即過分注重形式和知識，以致忽略了知識的實用價値。這是在敎材敎法與考試上隨時所表現的。大學入學考試如能遵免這種弊病，非但所選人才可以更加有用，而且足以改善中學的敎材敎法，並糾正學生的求學態度，可以說是中國敎育改進的可能出發點。</p>
<p>不論任何學科的敎學，定義一類條文，當然必須理解而能應用，才有便値。考試時如但問條文，無形中不免鼓勵學生死記，而能背能默者未必能理解與應用。所以試題應當强迫考生對於理解及應用有所表現，俾可明確辨別其能力高下。（寄目紐約成功湖聯合國人事處）</p>

<p>〔本報重慶十二日電〕楊妹頃成爲全國人士矚目之神秘女郎，伊之日常生活舉動，已使本報各地讀者關懷。李之郁局長今接鄂財廳金正景十日航函，謂楊妹九年不食，經貴局證實，誠爲曠代奇聞，如楊妹者，眞中華人瑞，爲我國「國賽」，允宜居以凈室，供以香花，任人瞻拜，不應穿之以旗袍，抹之以口紅，使天上仙妹變爲人間妖婦。萬一楊妹與俗俱化，重食人間烟火，則貴局長罪過不小。</p>

<p>另據確訊：楊妹頃獲鄙都來函，伊惟一親屬叔爺病亡，伊急思遄返原籍料理渠一諸·一鷄·五担高梁之私有財產。季之郁曾再三聲明楊妹短期內不得離渝，如楊妹一旦離渝，則不食之謎，將無揭開之期。衛生局今日已成騎虎難下情勢，深入檢查。無此魄力及條件，放棄研究，則勢必貽笑大方，故今與李之郁談及楊妹事，渠已顯露憂慮焦急神情？</p>
<p>川術生處長董秉奇已赴京滬，渠係醫學界檢查楊妹肉體之第一人。研究楊妹已不僅爲渝衛生局之責任，全國科學界人士實應共同促成之也。目前演變，已至非嘉·滬·等地甚至國外科學家來渝參加合作，則楊妹檢查可能恐將無法展開。董秉奇晤劉瑞恒·林可勝·蔡翹等博士結果，關係楊妹次步檢查問題至大，値此千戴難逢機會，衛生部似不應再對楊妹事件保持沉默或漠視。</p>

<p>〔本報杭州十日訊〕杭州報紙上，盛傳市府今年收入特別好，但託者問過市長，却並非事實。湖濱路翻修，若干風景區在整理，各家商店也在整頓門面，看上去，今年杭州的確是一番盛景。但鄰近的杭嘉湖三屬，今年蠶汎雖旺，可是桑葉價格奇昂，蠶農們竟有買不起桑葉而將認傾倒入田內作肥料的，有的忍痛借了高利貸來君蠶，而蠶爾賣不起錢，政府雖然提高收價到二千五百萬元一祖，還是不能够本，更有一些人，硬以低價收買農民的繭十，再以高價售給行廠，還有人取得了收價的貸款，挑剔繭子的弱點，故意抑低價格，而貸款的剩餘用作其他用途了。</p>
<p>農胞們原期「看蠶」與「春花」賺得一些錢來，耕耘田地，但現在蠶是落空了，春花也賺不了錢，秧田的本錢又只好向別人借貸，可憐江南的農村裏竟有借錢還米，借一還三的事實。希望當局能予以注意才好。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　卜眠</p>
<p>〔本報南陽八日訊〕劉伯承諸匪自從開了一張「五月渡江」的空頭支票以後，這筆賑始終交不了，於是，又開出一張「企圖殲滅華中野戰軍主力」的劃綫支票，這一張劃綫支票能不能兌現呢？鐵的事實早已決定了他的命運。</p>
<p>宛西團隊　在外表上是擊潰了，實際上係化整爲零，（按宛西團隊平時即以不妨碍生產散步民間）雖然損失一部份槍枝，但在匪軍方面來說，尙未達到預期的目標，相反的，在鄧縣西厚坡李官橋一帶，被張軫兵團消滅了一個半團，劉匪二十縱隊打得落花流水，老河口得而復失，劉伯承默默的由西峽口回到伏牛山區，他是眞的西竄了嗎？不，決不，這是他的烟幕，當國軍在鎭平休息的三天中，匪確偷偷的由鄧縣繞道唐河，潛入泌陽西北地區，種下了南陽外圍的種子，中原的命運，好壞就看這一齣壓軸戲了。</p>
<p>當國軍東西遠離平漢綫的時候，駐馬店·確山·信陽·這一條直綫的中間地區，顯然是一個空隙，匪軍把握了這個好機　會，由駐馬店北南下，企圖圍攻確山，直取信陽，當時因爲兵力的薄弱，戰略的部署，軍事當局斷然的放棄了駐馬店，以神速之動作，調集了快速部隊兼程趕赴確山，決心堅守，廿七日下午七時，劉匪三六縱隊，一縱隊一部，陳匪八縱隊六三·六四·六五·六六·四個團魏似樓獨立旅等的四萬人，將確山團團圍住，可是，在時間上他已晚了兩小時，確山的新部署早就完成了，因此，激戰四畫夜，匪終未逞，他們自己也認爲行動遲緩，情報不確，估計錯誤。接着，三六縱隊便向鐵路以西流竄，假如虛心地研究一下，匪是佯攻確山，企圖誘我西進主力東援，跌入渠之布袋網，一鼓殲滅之，這就是自命不凡的劉伯承佈署的陷阱。</p>
<p>至廿九日午夜，匪軍狼狽向西北逃竄，同時，劉匪二十縱隊及陳匪十縱隊，也陸續由泌陽西北地區疾進指揮該戰役的張軫將軍，早知其預設之陷阱，乃向賒旗鎭東橋頭移動。本月一日，匪軍愈見增加，計有劉匪二，三，六·十四個縱隊，陳匪十縱隊，陳賡四，九縱隊，孔從周卅八軍，新一旅，新二旅，廿二旅，戰情進展達白熱化，雙方短兵相接，漢口基地空軍亦以强大陣營總成之機羣，畫夜助戰。一片平原，宛如血海，爲了避免主力無謂的損傷，國軍乃繼續分三路向南陽轉進，誘匪深入，以撲滅於南陽堅强陣地之前。匪軍以五倍於我之兵力，向國軍猛撲，因此，在慘烈戰事進行的過程中，擁護主力的魯師，便陷於匪軍的層層包圍之中。</p>
<p>二日，匪以主力向我南北突擊，枱樹坡以南明黃附近之七八十村落，咸爲匪佔領，國軍前仆後湧，奮力突圍，在匪軍重重。</p>
<p>火網封鎖　之下，大部份終於衝出了重圍，師部眞燭部隊及其餘一小部仍在匪軍的包圍中。三日，南陽的突擊兵團向東壓迫，到達了明黃，與馬劉營被圍的國軍僅差十八里，反擊部隊亦傾力支援，空軍在照明彈照耀之下，徹夜猛炸，被圍的部隊，雖彈盡糧絕，仍以白刃及木棍苦戰，最後連電話兵亦加入火綫，這是可歌可泣的一幕。魯師長黃副參謀畏與一部官兵，終究突破了十數重圍，經過兩晝夜的摸索，夫進杯水，未食粒米，忠實善良的老百姓，替他們調換了便衣，勇敢的担任嚮導，穿過崎嶇的道路，偷越羊腸小道與溝渠，最危險的時候，在麥田裏匍匐了兩里路，五號的晚上他倆安由全的回到了南陽城，對於這一位英勇的老百姓，我們表示無限的敬意。這一個突圍戰的結果，我軍傷亡兩千餘人，匪的死傷却比我多三倍。</p>
<p>匪實行孤注一擲，於四日向南陽三路猛攻，一路由東南竄入粟河店（距城八里），一路由東北向大盆窰（距城十五里）進攻，另外一小股則由王村舖（距城廿里）向城西飛機塲奇襲，我守城官兵在王司令官指揮之下，沉着固守，至十時半，匪攻勢受挫，重新佈陣，午夜兩時再度猛攻，三小時內匪傷亡三千多人，見大勢已去，遂於拂曉潰退至距白河五華里處，五日徹夜未聞槍砲聲。六日晨的情報，證明了匪己分東，東北，西北，南，四路潰退，截至現在，南陽局勢　好轉，四十里內無匪踪。這一戰結束，匪傷亡三萬人以上，俘虜兩干多，其他戰利品無算，我僅死傷三千多。</p>
<p>當此南陽戰局緊急之際，記者特專機飛南陽作一次巡禮，南陽的老百姓是馴良的，有警覺性，敏感，他們不但自動的帮助軍隊做工事，而且以比賽的心理爭先爲榮，年靑的學生發動的到醫院服務，看護榮軍，十幾家中小學照常上跺，甚至於將校舍慷慨的獻作傷兵醫院，另搭帳逢臨時課室，各商店營業照常，整個的南陽城毫無一點紊亂的現象。</p>
<p>這是匪軍的最後一條走索，南陽大戰的羣局，決定中原戰塲的命運，也決定匪軍今後的動靜。進退維谷的劉伯承，今天，他正在諸葛亮當年隱居所在地的臥龍崗徘徊着，躊躇着。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十二日廣播：杜魯門總統今在加用福尼亞大學發表演說，暢談　蘇關係。其措詞之嚴厲，前所未見。據稱，「蘇聯拒絕爲世界和平而合作，極爲失望，但仍盼蘇方放棄成見，參加有關和平之誠摯談判。」杜總統利舉蘇方拒絕合作之事實如次：（一）拒絕參加歐洲復興計劃，（二）在聯合國不合理的運用否決權；（三）對東歐各國作間接之侵略，並對中東各國施用壓力；（四）利用共黨干涉他國內政。杜魯門繼稱，蘇聯所反抗者不僅美國一國，而爲全世界。美國對於蘇聯或任何一國，均無侵略野心，世界各國如欲恢復安全，則必須終止蘇聯之侵略行爲。　杜魯門在此方面並列舉蘇聯在希臘與朝鮮之行動作證。</p>
<p>〔中央社記者盧祺新隨美總統一行奧勒岡州尤金眞電〕杜魯門總統今夜在此間聲稱，渠愛慕〔老友〕史達林，渠幷稱在波茨坦會議時，渠與史氏相處甚得，渠稱，蘇聯領袖係一高尙人物。杜魯門係在其赴舊金山之專車上，於此間聚集之廣大聽衆狡表上項言論。杜魯門於重申美國之世界和平願望時稱，渠前赴波茨坦會議時，對蘇聯曾懷有最大善意，並曾與史達林獲致某種特殊協議。渠稱雖然渠對史達林表示友好之個人情感，但史氏終爲政治局之囚徒，而不能隨其本身之意旨而有所舉動。杜魯門幷稱，史達林對其所證訂之協定，在可能情形下當予以遵守，但蘇聯政府中人士則確切聲明史達林不能遵守協定。杜魯門總統表示渠相信美蘇二國終將有一日明瞭其相互利益之所在，即繫於全世界之和平與幸福也。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕國民議會今日在寂靜之氣氛中，聆取皮杜爾外長爲倫敦六國會議關於西德之決議辯論達兩小時之久，僅人民共和黨議員及少數緩進派議員偶或鼓掌歡呼。此次辯論結果，可能爲許曼內閣命運所繫，將於十二日繼續進行，而於下星期二將倫敦會議之決議提付表決。外傅皮杜爾於表決後即將辭職，但此說尙不能獲得證實。</p>
<p>皮杜爾之演辭，强調倫敦六國會議之決議，並未忽略對歐洲及法國的安全保證，反之，且保證不使德國得以利用魯爾，以控制及左右兩鄰之經濟。此外，法國本此協定，並巳第一次獲得美國之保證，縱於一般佔領狀態結束以後，美軍仍將繼續駐在德國之重要地區。皮杜爾並聲明渠對於九月一日前召開德國制憲議會之建議，並不感覺特殊興趣。法國政府祗有一個條件，即在德國所設之政權，不容由蘇聯單獨保留過份或控制的勢力，德國決不能成爲任何一個盟國的工具，捨此以外，蘇聯隨時可以參加建議在德設立的機構，吾人並盼得在儘可能迅速的時期內，與蘇聯獲致協議，皮杜爾繼以懇切之態度籲請國會批准此一六國協議，他說：「本人切盼諸位勿使法國陷於孤立。余並非易於反悔之人，諸位可以相信本人從不表示無理的贊成，或無理的推諉。法國政府並非不知德國有被分裂爲二的危險，但此乃不能由法國負責的狀態，法國政府同時亦明瞭柏林之局勢，並不低估該處之危險。法國政府當一再聲明其最後目標，仍在與各盟國獲致協議，法國政府希望蘇聯政府匪儘速會同其他盟國，共謀德國和約問題的解決。法國政府今所面臨者，爲與盟邦合作或保持孤立間的選擇，法國政府認爲倫敦會議的決議可以接受，該項決議雖非完善，但須首先予以批准，使其正式成立，始可予以改良。傳許曼總理擬使國民議會週二就倫敦會議決議之表決，成爲對政府之信任票。政界人士相信此舉可使政府獲得比較多數的支持。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市米價，連日空前上漲，漫無止境。楓涇地區，並發生搶米情事，影響該地食米運滬，致人心惶惶，做關民生至鉅。吳市長特於昨日下午五時，在市府會議室招待記者，報吿市政當局刻正力謀抑平對策。吳市長認爲食米漲風之起因有三：（一）靑黃不接，（二）大量食米走私運往江北，（三）結匯證明書辦法施行之影響。現當局之處理辦法分二方面進行：（一）涇遝米發生搶風，業已電請江蘇省政府即予遏止，並請其對今後米商運米妥加保護。（二）業已急電陳報行政院長翁文灝及糧食部長關吉玉，速將遠方產區代講之食米卅萬石於月底前趕運來滬供應民食。</p>
<p>據確悉：吳市長以感於最近本市物價漲風無法遏止，深爲扼腕，曾於本月九日正式向行政院翁院長提請辭職。記者昨於招待會中曾以此叩詢，吳氏巳予承認。惟因翁院長力加挽留，並允妥謀善策，故辭意業已打消，決暫時勉爲其難云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨午舉行記者招待會時，對交大學生之發起「反對美國扶植日本」大遊行事，再度有所斥責，對於日昨交大同學自治會之「給吳市長的一封公開信」，認爲是故意混淆社會視聽，簡直已忘了自己是中國人。市府所以向校方提出質詢，乃在於查明此次之反美運動是否受人操縱，若純爲學生愛國運動，則市府必予同情與協助，若係共匪策動，則決加嚴究。現種種事實表現均足以證明此次遊行顯屬有計劃之陰謀：六月三日學生自治會召開反對美國扶植日本座談會，被邀請者，除吳市長外，均係左傾敎授，成一面倒之勢，目的在於打氣。座談會翌日，當即召開各科系代表大會表決採取一致行動，定五日百餘團體實行大遊行。事後加以歸納，可以證明三點：（一）所謂反對美國扶植日本大遊行，顯係在各科系代表大會召開之前早經決定者。（二）少數交大學生事前曾與陰謀主動者勾結聯系，絕未報吿大多數同學。（三）各科系代表大會，係受三十餘絕對少數學生所把持操縱。</p>
<p>市長態度激動</p>
<p>吳市長昨日態度頗爲激動，渠稱問題之癥結在於大遊行幕後是否有有操縱，市府所提出之各項質詢，即係根據上項原則所提出，若校方能逐條明白答覆，證實此係純粹之學生愛國運動，則我吳某人可親至交大道歉云云。</p>
<p>至於學生自治會公開信中所提出之第十點，（原文爲：在您第一次的所謂七點「查詢」中，問了六個「何人」，在所謂八點「再查詢」中，間了九個「何人」，請問在秘密逮捕「自動」失蹤曆出不窮的今天，追問何人，懷了什麼居心？）吳市長之答覆爲：目的在於把陰謀者的陰謀行動公之於社會，冀予以道義及法律之制裁。若學生之反美扶日乃純粹之愛國行動，則主持者應該可以挺身而出，唯有陰諜者才互相推諉責任。</p>
<p>保證公開傳訊　吳市長並絕對保證，市府此番查究主動學生完全公開，將來由警察局傳訊時，亦公開請新聞界列席，並將內容公布，給全市市民自行公斷。</p>
<p>吳市長最後並揭示共產黨之三部曲爲（一）以少數人刦持公衆，（二）以有組織之少數人來利用無組織之民衆，（三）利用動聽之名義而擾亂治安。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市電力，自來水，煤氣三大公用事業公司，因自勝利以來，駐滬及過境軍事機關部隊使用水電煤氣從不信款，各公司不堪損失，最近已向市政當局請求解決。彼等對於軍事機關之使用，願予以折扣等優待辦法，但希望勿將賬單置之不理，以免賬目永遠懸宕而增加困難。據悉，上海電力公司每月供應軍事機關電力而無法收費者，佔總收入約百目份之一，以五月份而論，約近百億元。閘北水電公司因境內軍事機關部隊尤多，故每月損失佔總收入百分之六，五月份約爲二百億元。上海自來水公司之損失爲總收入千分之五，五月份約六億餘元。上海煤氣公司損失者爲總收入百分之一·五，自勝利迄今各軍事機關欠款達十五億餘元，以目前幣値計算爲數亦極可觀云。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕二十世紀是一個競爭劇烈優勝劣敗的時代，一切工作都得講究效率，這在工業高度發展的國家裏尤其如此。他們的科學家與事業家不斷地在研究；如何能使工作的效率增加？如何能節省時間人力？如何能减少浪費，增加財富</p>
<p>昨天中國工業管理協會上海分會成立，餘興節目中放映一部新近從美國借來的「動作研究」影片，這就是一種對於用手工作的效率的研究，是美國伊滬威大學（lowa）專家們的心血結晶。他們發現人類在日常普通的用手工作中，由於無知與忽視，不知浪費了多少可以節省的時間與精力。</p>
<p>短短過程十步動作　銀幕上首先表現出任何一種用手的工作，其經過都可以分成幾部動作。以一人從筆架上取筆在文件上簽字後再放問筆架爲例，將手伸向笨架是第一步動作，在筆架上選擇茶一枝筆是第二步動作，將這一枝筆揑住是第三步動作，將筆取向身邊是第四步動作，將筆尖指向紙上應該簽字的地方是第五步動作，開始簽字是第六步動作，簽好後將筆送向筆架是第七步動作，在筆架上尋覓該筆的位置是第八步動作，挿入筆架是第九步動作，將手仲回是第十步動作。這一段短短的退程，分析其動作竟達十個之多，其中有的是移動肩部肌肉的，有的是移動肘部肌肉的，有的是移動腕部肌肉的。肩部與肘部的動作所費的力較大，所費的時間亦較多。科學家們在分析之後，覺得在大多數的工作中，有許多肩部與肘部的動作是可以减省或可以替代的。</p>
<p>左手常處無用地位　據着銀幕上又表現出，普通人們用手的工作中，左手常常是處於近於無用的地位。譬如將三十個挿頭挿到一塊木板的三十個圓洞中去，一般人的做法都是用左手先拿了一大把挿頭，然後右手從左手中一個一個的取出來揷入，裏面雖然兩隻手都在動，實際具有工作效果的僅可以說是一隻手而己，這樣大大的减低了工作效率。</p>
<p>基於上述的分析，於是研究出增加兩手工作效率的方法來了：那就是儘量减少肩部與肘部的動作。在不能减少時，左手與右手應以相反而對稱的方向同時運用。</p>
<p>銀幕上繼續映出舊方法與改善後方法的效率比較。以前面所述的挿頭爲例，改善的動作是兩手同時伸向放置柿頭的盤中，各取挿頭一枚，兩肘以相反方向內折，兩手各將挿頭挿入木板，然後再同時各伸取第二枚，這樣繼續以對稱方式運用，證明所費的時間可以縮短不少。</p>
<p>廿杯冰水同時冲好　咖啡店裏僕歐冲冰水的工作效率是上述方法的應用，這樣僕歐有二十杯冰水要冲，先將冰一塊塊的放進一個個杯裏再一杯杯的冲進水去，他的手伸來伸去，其動作太單調重複而費時了，改善的方法先裂一個大木盤，盤底約一塊冰厚薄，開二十個杯口大小的圓孔，凑巧對準二十個杯口，先用一大塊薄板蓋住各杯，薄板上放置木盤，將冰塊大量傾入盤中，爲手鋪平，二十個圓孔中就各有了冰一塊，將薄板抽去，這二十塊冰就同時落入二十隻杯子中，然後用兩根皮管子接住水源，兩手各持一根，同時灌注，沒有多少時候二十杯冰水已同時冲好了。</p>
<p>不知增出幾多財富　銀行每逢月底要將結賬單寄給客戶，職員用左手拿信封，右手取賬單，幾百幾千份賬單，一張張的放入信封，這中間又浪費了多少時間。如果將信封分兩疊並放在桌上，封口向兩邊，中間用物輕輕壓住，兩手同時各取一份賬單，同時挿入兩邊信封，不消一半的時間，就可以完成工作了。</p>
<p>類似這一種以左右手同時利用及减少不必要的動作而增加效率的例子，在工塲，辦公室，糖菒舖，以及其他需要用手的工作中，隨時都可以研究實行。銀幕上介紹了不少的對照與比較，晨後以「滴搭滴搭」的鐘聲爲結束。它吿訴我們：人類如果能將每一個「滴搭」善爲利用，不知道可以增加出多少財富來啊！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於上海與外埠結匯證明書交易，中央銀行頃以第一四一號函通知各指定銀行，照下列辦法辦理。</p>
<p>（一）外埠結匯證明書得在上海出售，外埠所需之結匯證明書，亦可自上海方面購得。</p>
<p>（二）外埠指定銀行，若須出售結匯證明書，得將所擬出售之數額，電知其上海分支行辦事處，以便日後負責向中央銀行業務局結售。</p>
<p>（三）指定銀行滬分支行辦事處可憑上項電報，向中央銀行請發有效期七天之將種結匯證明書，俾便在滬出售。</p>
<p>（四）原結匯證明書，一經外埠指定銀行寄到，應即向中央銀行業務局繳銷。</p>
<p>（五）上海指定銀行代其外埠分支行辦事處購得結匯證明書後，得將其繳交中央銀行業務局，以憑電知中央銀行外埠分支行，以特種結匯證明書發給該指定銀行之外埠分支行辦事處</p>
<p>（六）上列各辦法，暫以上海與各埠間之交易爲限。其他各外埠間之交易不予適用。結匯證明書，交易市塲，昨日極爲平穩，五十四萬成交，匯豐銀行賣出最多。前日六十二萬之高價，係買賣雙方直接成交，並未透過指定銀行。某大公司即以此項高價，賣出四千三百餘美元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊歷端陽節後，米價瘋狂狂上漲，有迫近千萬大關趨勢。昨日北市塲特高粳竟創每石九百三十萬元新高峯，門售米店，再加百分之六合法利潤及運費，約達九百七八十萬元。突破千萬大關巳不在遠。</p>
<p>據關係方面分析此次米價所以狂漲原因：（一）執貨者居奇，不肯脫手；（二）昨今兩日到貨稀少，僅共到四千餘石；（三）昨日上午楓涇米船，載米一百六十餘石，遭貧民搶刧；（四）百物狂漲，刺激米價；（五）產地米價亦漲，無錫松江等地，每石亦達八百五十萬元。</p>
<p>麺粉　擯持未開，因經濟警員至市塲嚴密監視交易，並檢查派司，在各物皆漲之下，市勢雖挺，惟恐經濟警員之干涉，故無人敢喊價格，擯持至收市無交易。後塲外喊老車·兵船爲二百八十萬，大包麩皮二百六十萬，各升十萬左右。中信局繼續拋出，價未更動。小麥新貨三百九十萬，陳貨四百萬成交</p>
<p>雜糧　續挺，人心因各貨之漲勢未戢，故仍堅昂異常，貨主不願多售。黃豆因成本高，貨主報升十五萬元，漢口乍豆高貨四百八十萬，苟米·紅糧·各在北帮之續納下，挺升二十萬元。菉豆華南客帮吸取，升三四十萬。新蠶豆客胃减，到貨旺，獨吿回降三十萬，元麥價亦少上落。芝蔴加三四十萬，生仁交易甚少，大汶口生仁以一千七百八十萬成交。</p>
<p>食油　漲勢持續，人心仍看高，銀根鬆濫，買風仍盛，貨主大都握貨不售。豆油開市二千〇八十萬，後大有豆油二千一百十萬元，計漲一百萬元。生菜油挺八十萬，爲一千九百八十萬元，生油·小車蔴油各升一百萬，豆餅升十二三萬元。</p>
<h3 id="c108">有關人士分析　銀根鬆濫原因 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六月漲風，方興未艾，雖經當局拋售物資抽緊銀根，但迄無效果。據有關人士觀察，此次漲風之主因，實爲銀根極度鬆濫，而市塲上頭寸之過多，實由於下列因素所造成：（一）春季貸出之蠶繭貸款，目下己有半數以上流入都市，估計爲數在四萬億以上；（二）由於大局關係，華北資金仍不斷南流，平均每日在一萬億以上，且多爲現鈔，致本市行莊收付頻繁；（三）國行籌碼之放出，以端午節而論，估計即在一萬億左右。（四）自支票禁抵令下後，本票流通數量已大見增加，以作用相當於大鈔，信用之擴張，自然影響物價。現當局之希望，寄托於即將到埠之美援物資，屆時拋售與配給雙管齊下，物價或可暫時穩定。</p>
<p>昨日本市銀根，仍極鬆濫，市塲睛息居二角四五間。銀錢業票據交換中四行兩局一庫仍共差進五五〇〇億，就中中央銀行差進六四〇億，中國銀行差進四一九一億，交通銀行差進一〇六九億，農民銀行差出一一四億，中信局差進一〇一億，郵匯局差出五〇一億，中央合作金庫差進一一四億。商業行莊大交換差出二四七八億，小交換差進五五一〇億，本市外商銀行共計差進二四八八億。</p>

<h3 id="c156">論扶植自己 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 文基</p>
<p>天下任何事情，一涉政治，便往往令人覺得頭暈目眩，莫明其所攬何事。姑以今日國人「反對美國扶助日本」一事爲例。</p>
<p>此事討論迄今，業已年餘，各界所發議論，早巳極爲豐富，極爲夾纏。</p>
<p>有些人反對美國扶助日本，其原始理由在於担心日本東山再起，那時最先受害者必又爲我國，故而予以反對，此原極爲正當正常。可是接着把筆一歪，轉到反對提高日人生活水準上去，說什麼他們紗錠竟有多少多少，而我們只有多少多少；只因我們少，乃嫌他們多，結論自然是必須叫他們减少得比我們少的還要少，以顯得我們之多，才肯罷休。此蓋業已認定我們萬無以他種方法去增多的希望。這樣的想法，推論下去，必使日本國內也有紛亂，鐵路交通也劑裂斷掉而後可。這種討論本以一條垂直綫始，之後不知怎麼就歪到一邊去了。</p>
<p>又有些人亦主反對美國扶助日本，可是不知怎麼思路一轉，忽然認爲美國扶助日本別有作用，助日助華，同是一助，今旣助華，必也不懷好意，於是於反對美國助日之際，同時也喊出了反對美國援華的口號。接着下去，自然很容易把嘴一歪，把口號轉到「反美」上去。本以討論「反對美國扶助日本」始，而終於只剩了「反美」二字。此原也是一條垂直綫，之後於不知不覺中就歪到另一邊去了。</p>
<p>此還只及「討論」，可是於最近十數天中，是項「討論」又進而轉爲行動，由議論之夾緾不淸，轉而爲行動的紛緾不淸。</p>
<p>在這個龐雜紛紜的狀態之中，有些人認爲美國助日太過份，有些人認爲美國援華太積極，有些人認爲美國援華不够理想，有些人認爲美國應該無理由地予以反對。此外自然還有自甘承認自己出品永非日貨之敵因而担心不能繼續發財的那些沒志氣的可憐蟲。於是情形顯見得愈加複雜。</p>
<p>實則講到美國助日助華問題，吾人應該知道：國與國間祗講利害，不問是非，乃是以利害爲是非的；國際之間蹤有助人之舉，終歸本於自助。故欲他人助我不助人，必先自謀有所助於他人。此是事實，非一時空談是非所能濟事。</p>
<p>所奇的是：上述各派論者之中竟是很少有人論到中國自己的，而今日中國却正是最需檢討自己之國家。關於此點，說得最見頭腦淸楚之一人，我覺得是燕大陸志韋。他說：「美國扶植日本是程度問題，而現在尙不到恢復侵略勢力之程度。但美在亞東之防蘇計劃如遭失敗，則扶日防蘇是必然的……今日重要的是要自己掙氣，現在豈非任何人皆在欺侮中國。」（七日申報）換言之，自己如果不掙氣，就令日本不能來使華，可是侵略國家豈是只止日本？另一人又是胡適之。他說：「談美國給戰時的敵國保留工業，就是有作用的把它扶植起來，那是不對的。我們就是被扶植的國家。如果把扶植就當作扶助侵略力量，豈非大錯？……由於日本恢復的快，中國恢復的慢，我們只能憂慮自己。說句公道話，不能由於自己倒霉不長進不繁榮，也希望別人同自己一樣倒霉，所以雖是正當的憂慮也有點不很正常。」（六日申報）</p>
<p>削弱人家決非即是增强自己；我們不能把自己的國防建築在他國國勢的削弱上面，</p>
<h3 id="c157">失傳的秘密 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>自私是人類的劣根性，難得有一個發明家肯睿智的把他的發明公之於世，造福人羣。大多數人將自己的發明視爲一己的財寶，珍藏守秘，不肯外露。一旦發生意外，人亡法失，不知再需幾許人的努力才能將這項秘密發掘出來。有時，這些發明竟然就永久失傳了。同樣的，爲了記錄疏忽，或者愛國心等，也埋沒了不少發明方面的秘密。</p>
<p>舉例來說，義大利的牧師魯琪塔蘭替在生前將失傳了的古代製造彩色玻璃的方法重新研究出來。他放棄了宣揭聖道的工作，製造出一些義大利最優美的彩色玻璃窗。可是，一年之後，一八六二年，他不幸因血液中毒與世長辭，而他使用的秘密顏料竟就此失傳。</p>
<p>另一個犧牲者是阿當姆斯，奇異的金屬鉈（Thallium）的發明者。爲了尋覓一種硬如鋼而重量與價格僅祗鋼的一半的金屬，他實驗了五年多的電化法，結果提鍊出了鉈。他的財運立即亨通起來，各鐵路公司的幾千噸的定單傾注而來。但是，已經太遲了。阿當姆期的身心疲勞過甚，竟已不能支持了。他被關進了瘋人院。他對自己的研究過程未曾作過紀錄，並且拒絕洩露他的秘密。兩年之後，他和他的秘密一併脫離人世了。</p>
<p>一八九五年，英國人桑布立齊發明了一種革命性的新炸藥，這種新炸藥能使槍彈的射程增加兩倍。德國政府願出十萬元的代價向桑布立齊收購他的秘密。但是，由於愛國心的驅策，桑布立齊拒絕了德國政府的高價收買，寗願把他的發明買獻給自己的祖國。但是，當英國政府準備與桑布立齊簽訂合同時，傳來了他的實驗室發生爆炸的惡耗—那位科學家也遇難了。他未曾留下紀錄，繼起無人，祗在發明史上留下了一段黯然的回憶。</p>
<h3 id="c158">張勳軼事 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>張勳一武夫，雖不足道，然民六領導復辟，民國史上不能抹滅其名字。世人謂勳為蘇元春部下之差官（戈什哈），實則此中頗有曲折，爲人所不知，且張勳亦非其本名，茲一述之。</p>
<p>張微時，挾資在故都游蕩，所居逆旅有一客患病，張照料其醫藥飲食，此人病危時，吿張彼爲蘇元春部下之差官，奉命來京辦事，名張勳，今承養氣照料，願以後事相托，且以功脾（小武官之證件）及存銀贈之。此人死後，張爲葬於義地，即頂張勳之名，將蘇元春事辦好，到廣西銷差，蘇元春見其頗有幹才，即留用之，從此正式名張勳矣。不久蘇又派其入京差遣，勳到京暱一相公，縱情聲色，耗其資殆盡，而事未辦，有友贈以回南川資，勳竟不畏死，於天晚到達廣西，即請見蘇元春，時蘇正吃雅片，勳跪於床前，禀吿原委，蘇不言過癖，勳長跪不起，久之蘇忽發言，呌左右拖去斫了，勳被人挾持到大堂，內出一人，向縛勳者耳語，再謂勳：「還不趕快逃走！」勳即刻出城，走不數里，後有一馬追來，勳以爲命仍不保，乃騎馬者到勳而前，投一包，不發一言，回馬而去。勳開視爲銀塊，到一鎭天明住店，秤之足足三百兩紋銀。觀此，蘇元春亦可兒也。勳復辟事敗，由荷蘭使館出，仍居故都安定門小德張出售之宅，余訪其幕中友人萬公雨張念慈兩人，吿我以此事，言勳並不諱言之。</p>
<p>民前勳在南京以巨金買秦淮河名妓小毛子，後任長江巡閱使，駐在徐州，又納天津名坤伶王克琴，克琴入門，寵爲專房，小毛子鬱鬱以死。克琴爲勳生有一子，乃於勳復辟事敗，避入荷蘭使館時，竟席捲所有而逃。故都人士有一聯嘲之，茲錄於後：</p>

<h3 id="c159">命運之說 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 陳烟帆</p>
<p>許多偶然事件，一般人都要聯想到命運上去，而命運好壞，迷信的人又都會推源到因果報應上面。譬如一塲火災之後有死有傷，有人疑心是他們祖上沒有積德。某先生六十歲而沒有兒子，有人便以爲他做過了什麼壤事。如果這樣想，那無疑是一種近於殘忍的錯誤。</p>
<p>一個人的行爲和命運是並不相述的，史記伯夷利傳裏說伯夾叔齊積仁潔行，竟然餓死，而七十子中獨顏淵爲好學，然而顏淵也竟然貧乏而早死。盜跖日殺無辜，肝人之肉，暴戾恣睢，橫行天下，可是反而太平壽終。我記得託爾斯泰有一篇小說，上面說一個善良且有着美髮的小商人，有一次因到市塲上去，住在旅舍裏，第二天被冤枉爲殺人犯，而因此流放到西伯利亞，過了二十六年的罪犯生活。二十六年之後，他的家庭散了，他的頭髮白了，身體彎曲了，他已沒有地方可去。——眞正的殺人犯直到廿六年之後才被關了進去。善良忠恕的人常常遭遇那些可悲的命運。</p>
<p>當二個月之前萬里輪船觸礁之後，旅客們被救到了海邊的山上，幾個婦女想起她們的衣物財產都沉在海裏了，含着眼淚自言自語的說：「我們做了什麼壞事了呢？我不應該有這樣壞的運氣呀！……爲什麼乘了這條倒霉船呢？」我也在這條倒霉船上，而且把我的二年多辛勤積聚的當時値十多億的東西沉在海裏。也許在富人的眼光裏它是一些微細的數目，在我却是晴天中的霹靂。但我相信這並不是「上帝給我的懲罰」。</p>
<p>如果以爲一切災禍都是惡的果，那種錯誤是殘忍而且不道德的。這祗使是非不明：叫不幸的人更蒙受一種誣蠛和打擊。想得仔細一點，事情就很明白。如果自信行善而必得好果的人，飛機轟炸時他可以不到防空洞裏去。再如叫一個醉漢或白痴去開車，運氣再好一些也要跌了出來。我相信行爲和命運是不相連的，因此並不悲傷。</p>
<h3 id="c160">也談金魚雌雄鑒別法 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 金漁</p>
<p>閱本報吳吉人先生「怎樣鑒別金魚雌雄」一文，知道吳先生是一位同好者，並對金魚之飼養，有相當研究，茲願就我歷年飼養所得之經驗，對於雌雄鑒別的方法，作一簡略報導，而冀附驥之傳，諒爲吳先生所樂許。</p>
<p>按金魚的生長能力，並不弱於其他魚類，飼養一年，即能及尺，實非希罕之事（研究飼養容俟另文）。普通鑒別雌雄，在寸許（約須二月）以後，即可由身體之長短，鰭腹之形狀，用以判斷。大約雌魚身短而腹圓，由腹至尾間的距離，亦較雄魚爲短，並有明顯的分界痕跡，四鰭均呈橢形，略軟；雄魚不然：身較雌者爲長，腹呈橢圓狀，由腹至尾之間，甚難分別，四鰭爲菱形而硬，行動尤較雌者爲活潑。當在散子數月前（散子期約在每年三—五月），雄魚胸鰭前側，即生有銀色排列的星點；及至春間散子時，（魚生一年即可有子）雌魚固大腹便便，而雄魚的燦燦銀星，尤覺鮮明可愛，細心把玩，不難一目瞭然。</p>
<p>至於用手抵着腹部的方法，似乎不宜常用，因爲欲求金魚的發育，對於水的衛生和溫度，都要隨時注意，用手相探，不但於淸潔和氣溫有礙，而且對於魚的本身機能，亦有不愼而受妨礙的危險。兼之寸許之魚，年齡只有兩月左右，卵巢發育，尙未完全，單憑一摸，未必即可分曉；不知吳先生以爲何如？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Full-Day Meeting Held at the Legislative Yuan: Continued Interrogation on Administrative Policies; Various Committee Members Actively Spoke on Military, Political, Economic, and Other Issues; Many Pointed Out that Weng's Report Was Unrealistic <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The 10th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 12th for the entire day. President Sun presided over the meeting, and the interrogation of the Administrative Yuan President Weng Wenhao's policy report continued. Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions sat silently on both sides of the podium throughout the day, carefully recording the key points. Before noon, twenty-four legislators spoke and submitted written opinions. Most of them still criticized Weng's report for lacking focus, being empty and unrealistic, and unable to cope with the current emergency situation. Wang Hansheng and Liu Bokun questioned whether the government had emergency measures to deal with the situation in the north? Liu also said that the Weng cabinet lacked personality, avoided the important and focused on the trivial, and was an administrative cabinet or even a bureaucratic cabinet. If it still did not take responsibility for the entire people, but only for a few people or one person, it would inevitably collapse. The northern crisis was actually due to the failure of diplomacy, ignoring international influence, which led to fundamental errors. In addition, the corruption of military generals naturally led to military setbacks. Since the goal is to suppress the rebellion, we must pay attention to fundamental political issues. Firm and clear diplomacy, and a clean and capable military administration are essential to win the confidence of the people and soldiers. The ruling party should take responsibility. Shao Hua questioned why local administrative officials who were bad were not replaced? Was it the people who were making trouble, or the government who was incompetent? Deng Gongxuan, Feng Junlian, and Qi Zhihou all raised the issue of when to reform the currency system. Feng Junlian requested the government to announce the amount of issuance and the method of making up for the deficit. Qi Zhihou, Yu Zheng, Xiang Jutan, Feng Junlian and others all questioned what specific measures were being taken to strengthen the military? Was the replenishment and reward and punishment of the army still only considering factions and not merit? What specific measures were there to support and train local armed forces? Qi also said that the evidence that the Soviet Union was funding the communist army was conclusive. Did the government have countermeasures? The current situation was full of internal and external troubles. Why did the government have no overall plan? Cheng Cangbo questioned why there were no figures in the special budget? Wu Hexuan said, who was responsible for national defense and military affairs, the minister or the chief of staff? Why were new people not used for the new administration? Luo Hengqing asked why the people's deposits at home and abroad were increasing? Did the government have a way to collect and use them? Jiang Yiping suggested that investigations could be carried out abroad through legal procedures, and even confiscated, to compensate for the shortcomings of diplomacy. He also criticized why the administrative policy report omitted the judicial administration item? He hoped that detailed and concrete administrative measures would be proposed along with the budget to the Legislative Yuan. Wu Zhiren questioned why personnel policies were not mentioned? How could people with notorious records like Zhang Jia'ao be reused? Jiang Yiping and Li Yu both agreed with the opinions raised by Sun Guiji on the 11th that employment was more important than relief and layoffs. Li also said that the US aid utilization committee was large and whether it would repeat the mistakes of the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration"? Huang Yuanbin said that strengthening the suppression of rebellion and stabilizing the economy were the two major tasks. The government should strive to realize the goals provided by the policy.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Eleventh Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow to Continue the Interrogation of Administrative Policies <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>In the afternoon, more than twenty people continued to speak, question, and submit written opinions. Yang Yiju, Liu Yunzhao, Zhang Daohang, Wu Wangji and others raised opinions on strengthening the military, asking whether there were measures to clarify the conscription administration. Zhang and Wu also advocated abolishing conscription and grain requisition to avoid disturbing the people. Zhang Jinjian said that the goals set in the report were very good, but did the government have the魄力 to realize them, and what was the progress of implementation? He pointed out that the failure of past administrations was due to excessive centralization of power and corruption of institutions. Did the new government have the determination to decentralize power to the local level, and could it improve and simplify the broken machinery? Liu Mingyang and Liu Shidu again questioned what measures there were to stop inflation and save the collapsing economy. Chen Zifeng said: Since it was reform, it could not be perfunctory. Could the new government still ignore incompetent central and local officials who should be punished or replaced? Zheng Yanfen believed that it was too early to criticize the administrative policy as an administrative plan or result. He raised opinions on the constitutional aspect, saying that the constitution stipulated too few local systems, and detailed implementation plans should be prepared as soon as possible, and attention should be paid to the proper conduct of elections required for various local systems. He asked when the government planned to complete the establishment of the local political system stipulated in Chapter 11 of the Constitution? Li Yunliang questioned what plans the new government had to win Japanese compensation? Was it prepared to provide loans to support private shipping? Xi Zhenduo pointed out that the administrative policy ignored the frontier administration. During the meeting, Wen Qun proposed a temporary motion, believing that under the current situation, the new administrative council, which had not yet achieved anything, should not be overly criticized. He advocated stopping the interrogation and immediately convening a full-house committee to discuss the policy for two days before deciding whether to agree to it or not. President Sun said that according to the rules of procedure, in addition to exercising the right of consent and reviewing the budget, there were no other regulations for convening a full-house committee. Most committee members also believed that the interrogation of the administrative policy report was a right conferred by the constitution and a procedure stipulated by the rules, so how could it be automatically abandoned? Moreover, the meeting was in progress, so it was not the time to propose a temporary motion. Wen's opinion was rejected. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. President Sun reported that the numbering of requests for speaking and written opinions received in the past two days reached 220. The number of oral interrogations, on-screen readings, and automatic withdrawals was 101. There were still 119. He consulted the opinions of the meeting. Except for 73 written opinions that were sent directly to the Executive Yuan for a response, the remaining 46 oral interrogations were decided to be continued at the 11th meeting on the 14th. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the report that the Far Eastern Commission authorized MacArthur to allow Japan to participate in international conferences, the reporter recently inquired with the foreign affairs authorities. It is said that the United States once suggested in the Far Eastern Commission that for international conferences, the Allied Headquarters in Japan may send staff as observers after accepting the invitation if they believe that it is related to the occupation. If the Allied Headquarters deems it necessary, and with the consent of the host country, the Allied Headquarters personnel may bring Japanese experts to participate. What the Far Eastern Commission passed was the ratio suggestion. The report by the New Asia News Agency that Japan was allowed to send representatives to international conferences does not conform to the facts.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Desired Improvements for University Entrance Examinations <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Youqian</p>
<p>Today, the entrance examination methods of major universities in the country have many points that can be criticized. With this year drawing to a close, various universities will soon be preparing for the annual university examination. It seems not too early to discuss improvement methods at this time. The aspects of the current methods that are criticized and the possible improvements that should be examined are nothing more than the following three points: (1) Lack of organization, hence uneconomical. (2) Subjective grading, hence inaccurate. (3) Rigid materials, hence impractical. These are discussed separately below.</p>
<p>First, the fact that the current method is uneconomical seems to be widely known and does not need detailed proof. Every summer when universities hold entrance examinations, almost every student applies to several places in succession. Before School A has finished the examination, School B requires registration, and some even travel to different cities, which is extremely taxing and wasteful! Sometimes the examinations of two schools are on the same date, which is impossible to attend both and is infinitely regrettable. Moreover, after the results of the examination are announced, there are often a large number of those admitted who never report because they have also been admitted by other schools, and there are also those who have already reported but re-withdraw because they have been admitted by other schools. The changes and chaos never end. Before the war, the author advocated joint admission by universities. At that time, Central, Wuhan, and Zhejiang Universities jointly trialed it, and there have often been joint administrations by two or three schools since then. However, ten years have passed and there seems to be no significant progress. The possible reasons for opposing joint admissions can be considered from the perspectives of schools and students. From the school perspective, the conditions of each school are different, each has its own tradition, each has its own ideals, and each has its own needs. Independent administration allows each to act on its own without being constrained by other schools. If jointly administered, some schools are not very confident in the participation of professors from other schools in setting and grading the papers, while other schools are afraid that excellent students will preferentially choose other schools first, and therefore can only obtain second-rate students. Students, on the other hand, except for a very few who are truly excellent and have absolute confidence in the examination, most inevitably harbor a fluke mentality, thinking that taking the examination multiple times is like drawing lottery tickets multiple times, increasing the chances of winning. If it is a joint examination, it is almost like putting all eggs in one basket, which will reduce their chances of getting into school.</p>
<p>The possible reasons for students opposing the joint examination are not entirely without basis under the current situation where the examination results are not very accurate. This view can be dispelled as long as the method is improved and the results are entirely determined by ability and not affected by irrelevant factors. Moreover, the total number of students admitted by each university is fixed, and the ratio to the total number of high school graduates is also fixed, so whether it is joint or separate admissions, the admission frequency is actually the same. Unless separate examinations cause repeated admissions, which actually fail to meet the quota, thereby invisibly reducing the precious opportunity for advancement, if this is the case, joint examinations are entirely beneficial and without any harm to students.</p>
<p>It is only natural for schools to be unwilling to entrust the admissions to other schools. However, each school may still retain a part of its freedom when jointly administering the examination. For example, in addition to the common required subjects, a certain school may add special subjects. Within a subject, in addition to the common old test questions, a certain school may add special test questions. In addition to the common minimum, a tea school may add special conditions for passing standards. Individual situations such as these should not hinder overall cooperation. The universities in the United States are the most free, the least unified, and the most individualistic, but their combined University Entrance Examination Committee is very developed and handles the entrance examinations of various schools very smoothly. Chinese university educators have talked a lot about cooperation, and this is an opportunity to actually show the spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of joint admissions should include all universities in the country. Since all universities in the country are following the unified procedures stipulated by the Ministry of Education, there should be no difficulties in principle for a national joint examination. However, it also requires considerable training in technology. The scope does not necessarily have to be too large at the beginning, and can be gradually merged later. Schools with relatively similar conditions can first form a joint, and representatives of each school can negotiate basic principles, such as examination subjects, examination locations, the source and distribution of funds, and then hire examination and grading committee members for each subject, and invigilation committee members for each location, and prepare to proceed separately. If any school has special subjects or test questions, it can decide on its own and still handle them in conjunction with the joint examination. When students register, they can choose schools and departments in order, starting from their first choice, without adding restrictions, and may fill up to the tenth or even the twentieth choice. The admission standards for each school do not have to be uniform and can be flexibly adjusted. Any candidate who meets the standards of the first choice school and department will be admitted according to the first choice. If the first choice does not meet the standard, then the second choice will be considered. And so on, there should be no problems. If the scale is large, a simple system must be established for registration and inspection, and there is no need to adopt the Hollerith electric tabulation method for the time being.</p>
<p>Second, the current method is inaccurate. This is certainly not absolute. Generally speaking, outstanding students may be admitted every time they take an examination, while inferior students may not be admitted. Therefore, the successive examination method is credible and instructive enough to distinguish between the best and the worst students. But whether or not average students are admitted, we cannot help but admit that it is not entirely determined by ability, but partly by luck. For example, students A and B graduated from a certain school. A is usually better than B, which can be determined after a long comparison, but when applying to a university, B may be admitted while A may not. Such cases are often heard. Of course, part of the reason may be the instability of the candidates themselves, such as being temporarily flustered, resulting in abnormal performance. But the inaccuracy of the examination method must bear at least part of the responsibility.</p>
<p>Most schools now use traditional essay-style questions, and rarely use more objective new-style questions. The biggest reason why essay-style examinations cannot be accurate is that grading lacks standards and is partly determined by various accidental factors. If the number of examination papers is not large and there is sufficient time for grading, the impact of these accidental factors can be reduced to a minimum. Unfortunately, university entrance examinations are controlled by the opposite conditions, with at least several thousand or even tens of thousands of examination papers that must be graded and completed within a few weeks. Therefore, except for math questions, which are more objective in nature, the impact of accidental factors is very serious. First, because there are many examination papers and short time, it is necessary to distribute them to several professors for grading. The professors are uneven in their strictness and have different likes and dislikes. Therefore, the scores obtained for the same examination paper can vary greatly when graded by different professors. Secondly, the standards of the same professor cannot remain unchanged throughout. The examination papers for the entrance examination are completed in one day, and the time does not allow for the modification of the graded scores. If an already graded examination paper is graded again by a professor two or three days later, unless the score assigned for the first time has left a trace on the examination paper or in memory, the two scores will inevitably be different, and the difference can sometimes be considerable. In addition, the position or grading order of an examination paper is also an important factor in determining its score. The same examination paper will appear inferior and lose a few points if placed after several particularly excellent papers, and will appear outstanding and gain a few points if placed after several particularly poor papers.</p>
<p>However, objective examination methods also have their weaknesses and are also criticized, but their use in entrance examinations is absolutely more beneficial than harmful. For example, we do not deny that true-false and multiple-choice questions may be guessed correctly out of thin air, and therefore are also affected by accidental factors, but when the number of questions is large enough, this impact is insignificant compared to the errors caused by the lack of grading standards. However, objective examinations should make full use of time and prepare a large number of questions, otherwise they may be even more inaccurate than traditional methods. Many years ago, I saw a university using true-false questions for the entrance examination of a certain subject, but there were only ten questions. The candidates read these ten questions, filled in ten positive or negative symbols, and the slowest did not take more than five minutes, while the stipulated examination time was two hours, which was too ridiculous. Here, it must be solemnly stated that the task of setting questions for objective examinations is very cumbersome and can never be completed with a little thought in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Another criticism of objective examinations is that the questions often focus excessively on trivial memories such as names of people, places, events, and dates, which are only suitable for primary school students and are insufficient for selecting university talents. This is indeed a weakness of some objective examinations, but it is not unavoidable. In fact, objective examinations are not limited to trivial items, nor are they limited to memory, and are not based on a certain level. The University Entrance Examination Committee of the United States has accumulated many years of experience and research, and has now adopted objective examinations for everything except English composition. Objective examinations can not only be applied to high school graduates, but also to university graduates without any difficulty. For example, the graduate school examinations jointly held by the four most famous universities in the United States, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia, also use entirely objective questions.</p>
<p>Before the war, the author tried to compile a type of objective examination material for college students and tested it in the Zhejiang University entrance examination. The effect of predicting the candidates' performance after admission was comparable to the total score of the old-style examinations in various subjects. However, the old-style examination had seven or eight subjects, with each subject taking two hours, for a total time averaging fifteen hours, while the objective examination took only ninety minutes, a ratio of ten to one. Moreover, in order to avoid repetition with the examinations in various subjects, the materials used in the objective examination were mostly outside the high school curriculum, close to intelligence tests. If the objective test questions also draw from various subjects, assuming that each one takes one hour, which is half the time of the traditional examination, its predictive power will definitely increase a lot.</p>
<p>Third, university entrance examinations are directly responsible for selecting talents and indirectly affect the teaching materials and teaching methods of middle schools. There is a common and fundamental problem in the current school education in China, which is that it places too much emphasis on form and knowledge, so that it neglects the practical value of knowledge. This is manifested at any time in teaching materials, teaching methods, and examinations. If university entrance examinations can avoid this problem, not only can more useful talents be selected, but it can also improve the teaching materials and teaching methods of middle schools and correct students' learning attitudes. It can be said to be a possible starting point for the improvement of Chinese education.</p>
<p>Regardless of the teaching of any subject, definitions and other provisions must of course be understood and able to be applied in order to be valuable. If the examination only asks about the provisions, it inevitably encourages students to memorize by rote, and those who can recite and write from memory may not be able to understand and apply them. Therefore, the test questions should force candidates to show some performance in understanding and application, so as to clearly distinguish the level of their ability.

<p>[Shenyang, 10th of this Month] In the fields approximately thirteen [units of measurement missing] from Panyang City and near Sujiadun, there were twenty-three tractors plowing the land last week in preparation for planting the last batch of sorghum. These machines were shipped by the United Relief Headquarters earlier last year. However, since the US Relief Work Team air-lifted nineteen tons of agricultural implements, such as American-made plows, harrows, and tractor parts, to this place in mid-May of this year, their effectiveness has doubled after being used in conjunction with various machines. The team previously had thirty-eight fully equipped tractors. After the plows and disc-shaped and diamond-shaped harrows of the American Relief Work Team were all unpacked and assembled, it could be expanded to eighty fully equipped tractors. Currently, the farmland near Sujiadun cultivated using tractors totals 12,000 mu or 2,000 acres. Part of this land is owned by the Shenyang Political Committee, and part is the private property of fifteen farmers. Arrived at Siba in Hangzhou at 4:00 PM on the 12th and docked.

Currently, the river course is not fixed and urgently needs to be set with buoys. After buoys are also set at the Nanhui Cape, the two-section shipping centered on Zhapu will be extremely convenient, and its economic value is equal to half a railway, while the reduction in costs for merchants, the convenience of transshipment, and the benefits are incalculable. The two ships are waiting for the tide and will return to Shanghai soon. Whether or not it will be officially opened for navigation in the future remains to be decided by the Director of the China Trust Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Mystery of Yang Mei Cannot Be Unveiled; The Chongqing Health Bureau Is Riding a Tiger <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 12th of this Month] Yang Mei has recently become a mysterious girl attracting attention from people across the country. Her daily life and actions have become a concern for our readers across the country. Director Li Zhiyu received a letter sent by air on the 10th from Jin Zhengjing of the Hubei Department of Finance, saying that Yang Mei has not eaten for nine years, which has been confirmed by your bureau, is truly a rare wonder of the world. Yang Mei is truly a "national treasure" of China and should be housed in a clean room, provided with incense and flowers, and allowed to be admired by all. She should not be dressed in cheongsams and smeared with lipstick, turning a heavenly fairy girl into a worldly enchantress. If Yang Mei becomes vulgar and eats worldly food again, the fault of your director will not be small.</p>
<p>As of today, Li Zhiyu has not actively proceeded with the organization of the next step examination institution for Yang Mei. The difficulties he has encountered are that Yang Sen is interested in this matter, but he is still unclear on how to proceed and what specific measures to take. Secondly, the Ministry of Health only ordered the Health Bureau to investigate and reply to the reasons for the possibility of Yang Mei not eating published by Dr. Jiang Zhuahua, Director of the Municipal Hospital, before February, and has not mentioned a word about Yang Mei since then. However, medical professionals here have always believed that the previous 21-day observation was not strict enough. Now, she has been moved to Jiulongpo and is accompanied by a female police officer and a nurse, which is also far from careful. In addition, there is little understanding of Zhuo Songdai's attitude. Therefore, apart from the meeting's decision to establish a technical committee, there has been no further discussion.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Yang Mei recently received a letter from her hometown stating that her only relative, her uncle, has passed away, and she is eager to return to her hometown to manage her private property of one pig, one chicken, and five dan of sorghum. Ji Zhiyu has repeatedly stated that Yang Mei must not leave Chongqing in the short term. If Yang Mei leaves Chongqing, the mystery of not eating will never be unveiled. The Health Bureau has now become a situation of riding a tiger and cannot get off, and must conduct an in-depth examination. Without this courage and conditions, giving up the research will inevitably become a laughingstock. Therefore, when talking to Li Zhiyu about Yang Mei, he has revealed a worried and anxious expression.</p>
<p>Dong Bingqi, the director of the Sichuan Academy, has gone to Beijing and Shanghai. He was the first person in the medical community to examine Yang Mei's physical body. Studying Yang Mei is not only the responsibility of the Chongqing Health Bureau, but scientists across the country should also jointly promote it. The current evolution has reached the point where if scientists from Jia, Shanghai, and even foreign countries do not come to Chongqing to participate in cooperation, the examination of Yang Mei may not be able to be carried out. As a result of Dong Bingqi's meeting with Dr. Liu Ruiheng, Lin Kesheng, Cai Qiao and other experts, the next step examination of Yang Mei is of great importance. With this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the Ministry of Health should no longer remain silent or indifferent to the Yang Mei incident.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Farmers Borrow One, Repay Three: "Paradise" Reveals New Tears <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 10th] Hangzhou newspapers are abuzz with rumors of unusually high city revenue this year, but when someone asked the mayor, it turned out not to be true. Hubin Road is being renovated, some scenic areas are being tidied up, and various shops are also fixing their facades. At first glance, Hangzhou does indeed present a grand scene this year. However, in the neighboring three counties of Hangjiahu, although silkworm farming is thriving, the price of mulberry leaves is extraordinarily high. Silkworm farmers can't even afford to buy mulberry leaves and are forced to dump them into the fields as fertilizer. Some reluctantly borrow money at high interest rates to raise silkworms, but the silkworm cocoons don't sell for much. Although the government has raised the purchase price to 25 million yuan per load, it's still not enough to cover the costs. Moreover, some people are forcibly buying farmers' cocoons at low prices and then selling them to factories at high prices. Others have obtained loans for purchasing cocoons but find fault with the quality of the cocoons, deliberately lowering the prices, and using the remaining loan for other purposes.</p>
<p>The farmers originally hoped to earn some money from "raising silkworms" and "spring flowers" to cultivate their fields, but now silkworm farming has failed, and spring flowers aren't profitable either. The capital for rice seedlings must now be borrowed from others. Sadly, in the rural areas of Jiangnan, there are cases of borrowing money and repaying with rice, where borrowing one unit results in repaying three. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this situation.</p>

<p>Shangrao [Our Newspaper Report] On the morning of the 8th, the Keelung Garrison District of the Taiwan Garrison District received over 190 new recruits in the city, housing them in the Main Hall and the Tianhou Temple. They were scheduled to leave Rao within a few days. However, at 10:30 a.m. on the 8th, one of the over 120 recruits housed in the Main Hall suddenly raised his clothes as a signal, shouted a command, and the entire group responded, tearing down the bamboo walls surrounding the hall and rushing out, knocking down the guards and fleeing in all directions. The team leader and deputy leaders in the camp immediately opened fire to stop them, but because the residential buildings around the garrison were densely packed and all the recruits were not wearing uniforms, they could not be identified once they reached the streets. Four were killed on the spot, and only six were captured. As many as 115 escaped. The reason for the mass escape of the recruits is under secret investigation, and the Jiangbei Garrison District has been contacted by telegram to send personnel to investigate thoroughly. According to the team leader, Lai, when receiving the recruits on the 25th of last month, he discovered that several spies had infiltrated their ranks and had arrested and prosecuted them one by one. It remains to be seen whether the mass escape was also incited by illegal elements after a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Watching the Central Plains from Wolonggang <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Bu Mian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanyang, 8th] Ever since Liu Bocheng and his bandit gang issued a "crossing the Yangtze in May" blank check, they have never been able to cash it. So, they issued another check, "attempting to annihilate the main force of the Central China Field Army." Can this marked check be cashed? Ironclad facts have already determined its fate.</p>
<p>The Wanxi local forces have been defeated in appearance, but in reality, they have been reorganized into smaller units. (Note: The Wanxi local forces usually operate in the civilian population to avoid hindering production.) Although some weapons have been lost, the bandit army has not achieved its expected goals. On the contrary, in the Houpo Li Guanquiao area west of Deng County, one and a half regiments were annihilated by Zhang Zhen's army corps, and Liu's 20th Column was utterly defeated. Laohekou was regained and lost again. Liu Bocheng silently returned to the Funiu Mountain area from Xixiakou. Is he really fleeing westward? No, definitely not. This is his smokescreen. While the National Army was resting in Zhenping for three days, the bandits secretly detoured through Tanghe from Deng County and infiltrated the northwest area of Biyang, planting the seeds of Nanyang's encirclement. The fate of the Central Plains, for better or worse, depends on this finale.</p>
<p>When the National Army moved far east and west away from the Pinghan Railway, the central area of Zhumadian, Queshan, and Xinyang in a straight line was obviously a gap. The bandit army seized this opportunity and moved south from the north of Zhumadian, attempting to besiege Queshan and directly take Xinyang. At that time, due to the weakness of the force and strategic deployment, the military authorities decisively abandoned Zhumadian and, with lightning speed, mobilized rapid troops to rush to Queshan, determined to defend it. At 7 p.m. on the 27th, Liu's 36th Column, part of the 1st Column, Chen's 8th Column's 63rd, 64th, 65th, and 66th Regiments, and Wei Silou's Independent Brigade, totaling 40,000 men, surrounded Queshan. However, they were two hours too late. The new deployment of Queshan had already been completed. Therefore, after four days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandits ultimately failed. They themselves also admitted that their actions were slow, their intelligence was inaccurate, and their estimates were wrong. Then, the 36th Column fled westward along the railway. If one were to humbly study the situation, the bandits were feigning an attack on Queshan, attempting to lure our main force westward to aid, falling into their bag net and annihilating it in one fell swoop. This is the trap set by the self-proclaimed Liu Bocheng.</p>
<p>By midnight on the 29th, the bandit army was fleeing northwest in a panic. At the same time, Liu's 20th Column and Chen's 10th Column also advanced rapidly from the northwest area of Biyang. General Zhang Zhen, who commanded the battle, knew their pre-set trap and moved towards Dongqiaotou in Sheqizhen. On the 1st of this month, the bandit army increased, including Liu's 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 14th Columns, Chen's 10th Column, Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns, Kong Congzhou's 38th Army, New 1st Brigade, New 2nd Brigade, and 22nd Brigade. The battle situation reached a fever pitch. Both sides engaged in close combat. The Hankou base air force also used powerful formations of aircraft to assist in the battle day and night. The entire plain was like a sea of blood. In order to avoid unnecessary damage to the main force, the National Army continued to retreat in three routes towards Nanyang, luring the bandits in deeper to annihilate them before Nanyang's strong defenses. The bandit army, with five times our strength, pounced on the National Army. Therefore, in the course of the fierce fighting, the Lu Division, which was protecting the main force, was trapped in the bandit army's encirclement.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the bandits launched a major attack on us from the north and south. Seventy to eighty villages south of Taishupo near Minghuang were occupied by the bandits. The National Army surged forward, fighting hard to break out of the encirclement.</p>
<p>Under the Firepower Blockade of the Bandit Army, most of them finally broke through the encirclement. The division headquarters, the 真燭 force, and the remaining small part were still surrounded by the bandit army. On the 3rd, the Nanyang assault corps pressed eastward, reaching Minghuang, only 18 li away from the National Army surrounded in Ma Liuying. The counterattack forces also provided full support. The air force, illuminated by flares, bombed fiercely throughout the night. Although the surrounded troops were out of ammunition and food, they still fought bravely with bayonets and wooden sticks. In the end, even the telephone soldiers joined the firing line. This was a heroic and moving scene. Division Commander Lu, Deputy Chief of Staff Huang, and a part of the officers and soldiers finally broke through dozens of encirclements. After two days and nights of groping, they had no cup of water to drink and no grain of rice to eat. Honest and kind civilians helped them change into civilian clothes and bravely acted as guides, passing through rugged roads, secretly crossing narrow paths and ditches. At the most dangerous time, they crawled for two li in the wheat fields. On the evening of the 5th, they safely returned to Nanyang City. We express our infinite respect to this brave civilian. As a result of this breakout battle, our army suffered more than 2,000 casualties, but the bandit's deaths and injuries were three times more than ours.</p>
<p>The bandits made a desperate gamble and launched a fierce attack on Nanyang in three directions on the 4th. One route infiltrated Suhedian (8 li from the city) from the southeast, one route attacked Dabinyao (15 li from the city) from the northeast, and another small group launched a surprise attack on the airfield west of the city from Wangcunpu (20 li from the city). The officers and soldiers defending the city, under the command of Commander Wang, calmly held their ground. By 10:30, the bandit offensive was frustrated, and they reorganized their formation. At 2 a.m., they launched another fierce attack. Within three hours, the bandits suffered more than 3,000 casualties. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, they collapsed at dawn and retreated to a place five li away from the Bai River. On the 5th, no sound of gunfire was heard all night. Intelligence on the morning of the 6th confirmed that the bandits had retreated in four routes: east, northeast, northwest, and south. As of now, the situation in Nanyang has improved, and there are no bandit traces within 40 li. At the end of this battle, the bandits suffered more than 30,000 casualties, captured more than 2,000, and countless other spoils of war. We only suffered more than 3,000 deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>During this emergency in the Nanyang battle, our reporter made a special trip by plane to Nanyang for a tour. The people of Nanyang are docile, alert, and sensitive. They not only automatically helped the army build fortifications but also took pride in competing to be the first to do so. Young students volunteered to serve in hospitals and care for wounded soldiers. A dozen or so primary and secondary schools continued to hold classes as usual, and even generously donated their school buildings as hospitals for wounded soldiers, setting up temporary classrooms in tents. All shops operated as usual. The entire city of Nanyang showed no signs of disorder.</p>
<p>This is the last tightrope walk for the bandit army. The overall situation of the Nanyang battle determines the fate of the Central Plains battlefield and also determines the bandit army's future movements. Liu Bocheng, who is in a dilemma, is now wandering and hesitating on Wolonggang, where Zhuge Liang lived in seclusion.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 12th Broadcast: President Truman gave a speech at the University of California today, discussing Soviet-U.S. relations. The tone was more severe than ever before. It is said that "the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate for world peace is extremely disappointing, but there is still hope that the Soviet side will abandon its prejudices and participate in sincere negotiations on peace." President Truman cited the following facts of Soviet refusal to cooperate: (1) Refusal to participate in the European Recovery Program; (2) Unreasonable use of the veto power in the United Nations; (3) Indirect aggression against Eastern European countries and pressure on Middle Eastern countries; (4) Using the Communist Party to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Truman continued that what the Soviet Union is resisting is not only the United States but the whole world. The United States has no aggressive ambitions towards the Soviet Union or any other country. If countries around the world want to restore security, they must end the Soviet Union's aggressive behavior. In this regard, Truman listed the Soviet Union's actions in Greece and Korea as evidence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Lu Qixin Following the U.S. President's Entourage, Eugene, Oregon True Telegram] President Truman claimed here tonight that he admired his [old friend] Stalin, and that he got along well with Mr. Stalin during the Potsdam Conference. He said that the Soviet leader was a noble man. Truman made the above remarks to a large audience gathered here on his special train to San Francisco. While reiterating the United States' desire for world peace, Truman said that when he went to the Potsdam Conference, he had the greatest goodwill towards the Soviet Union and had reached some special agreements with Stalin. He said that although he expressed personal feelings of friendship towards Stalin, Mr. Stalin was ultimately a prisoner of the Politburo and could not act according to his own will. Truman also said that Stalin would abide by the agreements he signed whenever possible, but people in the Soviet government stated unequivocally that Stalin could not abide by the agreements. President Truman expressed his belief that the United States and the Soviet Union will one day realize their mutual interests, which lie in the peace and happiness of the whole world.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Bidault Defends Six-Nation Agreement; Fate of French Cabinet Hinges On It; Prime Minister Schuman Plans to Request Vote of Confidence from Parliament <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 11th] The National Assembly today listened to Foreign Minister Bidault's defense of the London six-nation conference resolution on West Germany for two hours in a quiet atmosphere, with only members of the People's Republican Party and a few moderate members occasionally applauding and cheering. The outcome of this debate may determine the fate of the Schuman cabinet. The debate will continue on the 12th, and the London conference resolution will be put to a vote next Tuesday. It is rumored that Foreign Minister Bidault will resign after the vote, but this claim has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Bidault's speech emphasized that the resolutions of the London six-nation conference did not neglect security guarantees for Europe and France. On the contrary, it guarantees that Germany will not be able to use the Ruhr to control and influence the economies of its neighbors. In addition, based on this agreement, France has for the first time obtained the guarantee from the United States that US troops will continue to be stationed in important areas of Germany, even after the end of the general occupation. Bidault also stated that he did not feel any special interest in the suggestion of convening a German constitutional assembly before September 1. The French government has only one condition: that the regime established in Germany should not allow the Soviet Union to unilaterally retain excessive or controlling power. Germany must not become a tool of any allied country. Apart from this, the Soviet Union can participate in the institutions proposed to be established in Germany at any time, and we hope to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union as quickly as possible. Bidault then earnestly appealed to the parliament to approve this six-nation agreement, saying: "I sincerely hope that you will not allow France to fall into isolation. I am not a person who is easily repentant. You can believe that I never express unreasonable approval or unreasonable excuses. The French government is not unaware of the danger of Germany being divided into two, but this is a state for which France cannot be held responsible. The French government also understands the situation in Berlin and does not underestimate the danger there. The French government will repeatedly state that its ultimate goal is still to reach an agreement with the allied countries. The French government hopes that the Soviet government will soon join with other allied countries to seek a solution to the German peace treaty issue. What the French government is facing today is a choice between cooperating with allied countries or remaining isolated. The French government believes that the resolutions of the London Conference are acceptable. Although the resolutions are not perfect, they must first be approved to make them formally established before they can be improved." It is rumored that Prime Minister Schuman plans to make the vote on the London conference resolution on Tuesday a vote of confidence for the government. Political figures believe that this move can allow the government to obtain a relatively majority of support.</p>

<p>[Reuters Berlin, 11th] Germans close to the Soviet military government revealed that the Soviet military government in Germany is actively preparing to announce the implementation of currency reform in East Germany within hours after the West German currency reform recommended in the London Six-Nation Conference communiqué is realized. Political figures believe that the recent disputes over passenger travel between West Germany and the Soviet occupation zone are a prelude to the implementation of East German currency reform. At the beginning of the implementation, traffic between the east and west occupation zones may be closed for several days. Sensitive Berliners, sensitive to the future of the Mark, are rushing to buy everything they can, even porcelain dictionaries, etc., in order to retain their value.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 12th] West German currency reform seems imminent, with the aim of recovering 70 to 90 percent of the existing currency. Although officials refused to comment, non-official sources said that the full picture of the plan of the United States, Britain, and France is to make West Germany stand on an economically self-sufficient basis. (1) The West German New Mark does not immediately have value in the international market, and its area of use is limited, but it is hoped that it will eventually have the international value of the American dollar triangle.

<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 11th] A Soviet official newspaper hinted on the 11th that the Soviet Union intends to withdraw from the Four-Power Control Berlin Committee and control the city on its own. Some members of the Allied Control Council have stopped or abandoned their work due to the Soviet Union's withdrawal, and the whole council is showing signs of disintegration. According to today's editorial in a Soviet-controlled newspaper, the Soviet authorities are now weighing the pros and cons of two options: continuing to jointly administer the city by the four countries, or directly negotiating with the German authorities by the Soviet occupation government. If the latter path is taken, then Berlin is in the Soviet occupation zone, and the Soviet regime's assembly in Berlin is beyond dispute.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 11th] The Brandenburg provincial government in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany today prohibited residents from moving to the British and American occupation zones. This kind of ban is still the first time.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 12th] British military authorities announced today that Britain and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on restoring railway freight transport between West Germany and Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 12th] US transportation officials said on the 12th that the Soviet Union had intentionally allowed 27 trains from West Germany to Berlin to pass through the Helmstedt iron rail barrier crossing the Soviet area.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 12th] The Soviet Army cut off freight cars from West Germany to Berlin on the 12th, "pending further notice," creating a crisis in the supply of food and coal to Berlin's two million residents. U.S. Army Commander General Clay condemned the Soviet action and denied the Soviet excuse of Berlin traffic congestion. Clay also said that the food supply here is "limited" and that he may not take action temporarily in order to gather information. U.S. troops stationed at the border said that on the 12th, German and Allied cargo troops were blocked from passing through the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<h3 id="e48">U.S. Representative Urges Security Council Approval of Atomic Energy Control Plan; Soviet Union Expected to Use Veto <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations Security Council's vote on the U.S. atomic energy control plan has been postponed until next week. The Soviet Union is expected to use its veto power. For two years, the Soviet Union has vigorously contended within the Atomic Energy Commission. However, the commission does not have veto power. Three weeks ago, the commission voted in favor of the plan despite Soviet opposition, and the plan was submitted to the Security Council for discussion.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Representative Jessup today moved that the Security Council approve the U.S. plan. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko requested to speak at the Wednesday meeting next week to prevent its immediate vote. According to Jessup, the governments of all nations face only two paths: to continue the atomic arms race or to agree to an international control plan that all nations can trust. All nine members of the Security Council, except for the Soviet Union and Ukraine, support Jessup's resolution. British Representative Jebb pointed out that scientific inventions have made people believe that absolute sovereignty cannot exist for the sake of maintaining civilization. The basic question is whether countries should accept the supervision of a supranational authority in the area of atomic energy. Otherwise, under the arms race, civilization will eventually be destroyed. The Soviet Union, however, demands that the United States first dismantle its atomic bombs and then implement controls.</p>

<p>Nishio's Accusations Expected to Affect the Entire Situation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The cabinet of Hitoshi Ashida will face a crisis in mid-July because Deputy Prime Minister Suehiro Nishio has been accused of political corruption, and Ashida's Democratic Party is now facing internal divisions. The Nishio case is being investigated by the "Special Committee for Investigating Illegal Property Transactions," but Nishio himself has expressed his willingness to resign from his current position. Because the Allied Headquarters is putting pressure on the Japanese government, forcing it to pass the national budget before any political changes, Nishio's departure from the cabinet will occur after the budget is passed. According to the customs of the Orient, which emphasize joint responsibility, Nishio's resignation means that all Socialist Party members will withdraw from the cabinet, which means the downfall of the Ashida cabinet, as the Ashida cabinet cannot continue to exist without the full support of the Socialist Party.</p>

Novikov argued that the report did not take into account the national interests of Asian countries. He said that the backwardness of Asian industry was caused by the exploitation of colonial powers. He believed that to develop Asian industry, it was necessary to mobilize domestic resources and to provide assistance from the outside without any political, military, or economic conditions attached. He also advocated developing Japan's peaceful industry to promote trade between Japan and other Asian countries.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Three Reasons for the Rice Price Surge; Mayor Reports on Handling Measures; Urgently Cables Central Government to Transport 300,000 Shi of Grain to Aid Shanghai <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The price of rice in the city has been soaring unprecedentedly for days, with no end in sight. In the Fengjing area, there have been incidents of rice looting, affecting the transport of rice to Shanghai from the area, causing public anxiety. This is a matter of great importance to people's livelihoods. Mayor Wu specially invited reporters to the municipal government conference room at 5:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the countermeasures that the municipal authorities are currently striving to implement. Mayor Wu believes that there are three causes for the rice price surge: (1) the period between harvests, (2) large-scale smuggling of rice to Jiangbei, and (3) the impact of the implementation of the foreign exchange certificate method. The authorities are currently dealing with the situation in two ways: (1) Regarding the rice looting in the Jingyi area, a telegram has been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting its immediate suppression and asking it to provide better protection for rice merchants transporting rice in the future. (2) A telegram has been urgently sent to Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, urging them to rush the transportation of 300,000 shi of rice allocated from distant production areas to Shanghai by the end of the month to supply the people's food.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that Mayor Wu, feeling deeply frustrated by the recent inability to curb the soaring prices in the city, formally tendered his resignation to Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan on the 9th of this month. When asked about this at yesterday's press conference, Wu confirmed it. However, because Premier Weng strongly urged him to stay and promised to seek a good solution, his intention to resign has been abandoned, and he has decided to reluctantly continue for the time being.</p>

<p>The first batch of 12,000 tons of rice under American aid, purchased by the American side in Siam and transported by our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, has already set sail from Bangkok and is now en route to China. The first ship, the "Jiguang" (繼光) carrying 1,460 tons of rice, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but was delayed by the unrest in Hong Kong and will arrive on the 15th. Following this first batch of 12,000 tons, there is still 25,000 tons of rice purchased and stored in Bangkok awaiting shipment.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Mayor Wu Criticizes Jiaotong University's Open Letter; Questions the Anti-Support Japan Event; Investigating Whether There Are Manipulators <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Mayor Wu, at yesterday afternoon's press conference, again criticized the Jiaotong University students' initiation of the "Oppose the United States Supporting Japan" march, and believed that the "Open Letter to Mayor Wu" from the Jiaotong University Student Union yesterday was deliberately confusing public opinion and had simply forgotten that they were Chinese. The reason why the municipal government raised questions to the school was to investigate whether this anti-American movement was being manipulated. If it was purely a patriotic student movement, the municipal government would definitely sympathize and assist. If it was instigated by the Communists, it would be strictly investigated. The various facts presented are sufficient to prove that this march was a planned conspiracy: On June 3rd, the student union held a symposium to oppose the United States supporting Japan. Except for Mayor Wu, all those invited were leftist professors, creating a one-sided situation, with the purpose of building momentum. The day after the symposium, a representative meeting of various departments was immediately held to vote to take unified action, and it was decided that more than a hundred organizations would carry out a march on the 5th. After summarizing the events, three points can be proven: (1) The so-called anti-American support Japan march was obviously decided before the representative meeting of various departments was held. (2) A small number of Jiaotong University students colluded and contacted the initiators of the conspiracy beforehand, without reporting to the majority of students. (3) The representative meeting of various departments was controlled and manipulated by thirty or so absolutely minority students.</p>
<p>Mayor's Agitated Attitude</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's attitude was quite agitated yesterday. He said that the crux of the problem was whether there was manipulation behind the march. The various questions raised by the municipal government were based on the above principles. If the school could answer each question clearly and prove that it was a purely patriotic student movement, then Wu would personally apologize to Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>As for the tenth point raised in the student union's open letter (original text: In your first so-called seven "inquiries," you asked six "who's," and in the so-called eight "re-inquiries," you asked nine "who's." May we ask, in today's era of secret arrests and the endless "automatic" disappearances, what intentions do you have in pursuing "who's"?), Mayor Wu's reply was: The purpose is to make the conspiratorial actions of the conspirators public to society, hoping to subject them to moral and legal sanctions. If the students' anti-American support Japan is purely a patriotic action, then the organizers should be able to stand up and speak out. Only spies would shirk responsibility from each other.</p>
<p>Guarantee of Public Interrogation Mayor Wu also absolutely guaranteed that the municipal government's investigation of the initiating students would be completely open. In the future, when the police department summons them, the press will also be invited to attend and the content will be made public, allowing the citizens of the city to judge for themselves.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu finally revealed the three stages of the Communist Party as (1) a small number of people hijack the public, (2) an organized minority uses an unorganized majority, (3) using appealing names to disrupt public order.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Unprecedented Oil Shortage; Does It Only Affect Traffic Order? Why Does the Authorities Ignore It? <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The oil shortage in this city not only has not improved due to price adjustments, but on the contrary, has become more serious in recent days. The congestion at each gas station is almost out of control. Every day, around 10:00 a.m., the supply is sold out, resulting in scrambling and traffic jams, which are often heard of.</p>
<p>There are currently 52 gas stations in Shanghai, but the gasoline supply for each station in May and June has decreased by 25% daily, meaning that the daily allocation for each station is only 300 to 900 gallons. Moreover, a small number of unscrupulous gas stations are taking the opportunity to channel oil into the black market, resulting in black market oil prices exceeding the legal price by more than double per gallon. This situation has become an open secret, but the relevant authorities are ignoring it and have not taken effective measures to stop it. In addition, each company routinely stops supplying oil on holidays, which further exacerbates the severity of the oil shortage.</p>
<p>Recently, there are often many vehicles that rush to the gas stations before dawn to wait, queuing up like a single long snake, but when it is about to be their turn to refuel, the gas station suddenly announces that it is sold out. Therefore, wasting time for four or five hours, and still not getting a drop of oil, has become commonplace.</p>

<p>According to regulations, ships carrying Japanese compensation materials to China are exempt from inspection. Most of the first batch of Japanese compensation materials have been transported to Shanghai so far, and there are still thousands of tons of materials en route to China. Among them, 3,000 tons were transported to Shanghai by the "Hai'e" ship at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The customs suddenly received a secret report claiming that in addition to Japanese compensation materials, the ship also carried a large amount of Japanese goods prepared for smuggling, and that this smuggled cargo was colluded by a senior officer on the ship supervising Japanese compensation materials and a major smuggling company in Shanghai in an attempt to smuggle in. Based on this secret report, the customs immediately secretly dispatched a number of officers to conduct an unprecedented search when the ship docked and unloaded. The search took a long time, and the customs may announce the situation of the seized smuggled goods today. After this smuggling incident, the customs will closely monitor ships carrying Japanese compensation materials in the future. The last ship carrying the first batch of Japanese compensation materials, the Zizhong (自忠), is now carrying 3,000 tons en route to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive in mid-June. It is possible that it also carries smuggled goods.</p>

<p>The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Kailuan Coal Mine have failed to resolve the issue of adjusting coal prices for June, resulting in a deadlock. However, coal vessels between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao continue to load and transport coal as usual, without interruption. The transported coal is the amount that the mine should deliver to the Central Bank as part of the fixed-order loan. Furthermore, considering the needs of public utilities in Shanghai and the various factories affiliated with the Resources Commission, the mine has separately notified the relevant authorities to send ships to Qinhuangdao for self-loading. The mine is willing to supply the coal at a price of 7,742,000 yuan per ton at Qinhuangdao port, based on the increased rate calculated by the Fuel Management Committee, plus the North China Self-Defense Special Tax, in order to maintain the essential needs of public utilities and state-owned factories in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Business Tax for This Year Levied According to Revised Rates; Finance Bureau Submits to Senate for Reconsideration <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>After the central government revised the business tax rate for this year, the Municipal Senate, considering that businesses could not bear the burden, resolved at its fifth general meeting to petition the central government to maintain the old tax rate. It also sent a letter to the Municipal Government instructing the Finance Bureau to temporarily collect taxes according to the original tax rate. However, the Senate's proposal was not approved by the central government. The Ministry of Finance has again ordered the Municipal Finance Bureau to levy the business tax for this year according to the revised tax rate, starting from January 1st. As the Finance Bureau had previously invited people to levy the spring business tax according to the Senate's decision and had already started collecting it at the original tax rate, changing to the revised tax rate now would require businesses to pay an additional half or 20% for the spring tax collection (the new tax rate levies the tax rate on business income; increasing two percent on income), which would inevitably arouse resentment among businesses and increase the difficulty of collection. Yesterday, the bureau submitted the case to the Senate for reconsideration to decide on a course of action.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Social Affairs Bureau Sets Standards for Height and Weight of Young Workers <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has recently received instructions from the Ministry of Social Affairs to establish standards for height and weight of young workers in the Southeast region of our country and hopes that factories will be instructed to comply. There is a section of explanation at the front, roughly saying: "Although the Factory Law has age restrictions on child labor, our country has not yet implemented a birth certificate system, which makes implementation very difficult. Now, after deliberation by the Committee for Determining the Height and Weight of Child Labor, the standard for young workers in the Southeast region is established, and all child laborers are renamed young workers." The standards for height and weight of young workers in the Southeast region are as follows: (1) The height of male young workers aged 14 in factories and mines should be at least 140 cm, and the weight should be 34.5 kg. The height of female young workers should be at least 142.5 cm, and the weight should be 35 kg. Young workers of both sexes who do not meet either standard will be prohibited from employment. (2) If male workers in factories and mines are 16 years old but their height is less than 161 cm and their weight is less than 50.5 kg, or if female workers' height is less than 155 cm and their weight is less than 47.5 kg, they will be regarded as young workers. (3) Within one year after the implementation of this standard, existing young workers in various factories who do not meet the standard for the age of 14 will not be eliminated for the time being, but they must be registered upon the start of implementation, and those who do not meet the standard after one year will be eliminated. However, new young workers must still be employed in accordance with this standard. (4) This standard will be implemented from July 1st, and is temporarily limited to Jiangsu Province and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The three major public utility companies in this city, namely the electricity, water, and gas companies, have been suffering losses because military units stationed in and transiting through Shanghai have never paid for their water, electricity, and gas usage since the victory. Recently, they have requested the municipal authorities to resolve the issue. They are willing to offer discounts and other preferential treatment methods for military units' usage, but they hope that the bills will not be ignored, so as not to leave the accounts permanently outstanding and increase their difficulties. It is reported that the Shanghai Electric Power Company loses approximately one percent of its total income each month due to supplying electricity to military units without receiving payment. Taking May as an example, the amount is close to 10 billion yuan. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company suffers even greater losses, accounting for 6% of its total income each month, due to the large number of military units stationed within its territory. The amount for May was approximately 20 billion yuan. The Shanghai Waterworks Company loses 5/1000 of its total income, approximately 600 million yuan in May. The Shanghai Gas Company loses 1.5% of its total income, and the amount owed by various military units since the victory has reached over 1.5 billion yuan, which is a considerable amount when calculated at the current currency value.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The twentieth century is an era of intense competition where the superior prevail and the inferior are eliminated. Efficiency is crucial in all work, especially in countries with highly developed industries. Their scientists and entrepreneurs are constantly researching: How can work efficiency be increased? How can time and manpower be saved? How can waste be reduced and wealth increased?</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Industrial Management Association was established. As part of the entertainment program, a newly borrowed American film on "motion study" was shown. This film represents research on the efficiency of manual labor, the result of the painstaking efforts of experts at the University of Iowa in the United States. They discovered that in ordinary daily manual tasks, people unknowingly waste a significant amount of time and energy due to ignorance and neglect, time and energy that could be saved.</p>
<p>Short Process, Ten Steps: The film first demonstrated that any manual task can be divided into several steps of motion. For example, taking a pen from a pen holder, signing a document, and then returning the pen to the holder can be broken down as follows: Reaching for the pen holder is the first step. Selecting a specific pen from the holder is the second step. Gripping the pen is the third step. Bringing the pen closer to oneself is the fourth step. Pointing the pen tip to the area on the paper where the signature should be placed is the fifth step. Starting to sign is the sixth step. After signing, returning the pen to the pen holder is the seventh step. Locating the pen's position in the holder is the eighth step. Inserting the pen into the holder is the ninth step. Retracting the hand is the tenth step. This short process can be analyzed into as many as ten movements, some involving the shoulder muscles, others involving the elbow muscles, and still others involving the wrist muscles. The movements of the shoulder and elbow require more effort and take more time. After analyzing these movements, the scientists found that in most tasks, many shoulder and elbow movements can be reduced or replaced.</p>
<p>The Left Hand is Often Useless: The film also showed that in ordinary manual tasks, the left hand is often nearly useless. For example, when inserting thirty plugs into thirty holes on a wooden board, most people would hold a large handful of plugs in their left hand and then use their right hand to pick them out one by one and insert them. Although both hands are moving, only one hand can be said to be effectively working, which greatly reduces work efficiency.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, a method was developed to increase the efficiency of both hands: that is, to minimize the movements of the shoulder and elbow as much as possible. When these movements cannot be reduced, the left and right hands should be used simultaneously in opposite and symmetrical directions.</p>
<p>The film continued to show a comparison of efficiency between the old method and the improved method. Using the aforementioned plug-insertion example, the improved movement involves both hands simultaneously reaching for the tray containing the plugs, each taking one plug. The elbows are then bent inward in opposite directions, and each hand inserts a plug into the wooden board. This symmetrical movement is continued, proving that the time spent can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Twenty Glasses of Ice Water Prepared Simultaneously: The work efficiency of a waiter in a coffee shop preparing ice water is an application of the above method. If a waiter needs to prepare twenty glasses of ice water, he might first put ice cubes one by one into each glass and then pour water into each glass. His hand moves back and forth, his movements are too monotonous, repetitive, and time-consuming. The improved method involves first creating a large wooden tray, the tray's bottom having a thickness equal to that of an ice cube, with twenty circular holes the size of the glass openings, precisely aligned with the twenty glasses. First, a thin board covers the glasses, and the wooden tray is placed on top of the board. A large amount of ice cubes is poured into the tray and spread evenly by hand. Each of the twenty circular holes then contains an ice cube. The thin board is removed, and the twenty ice cubes fall into the twenty glasses simultaneously. Then, two rubber tubes are connected to the water source, and each hand holds one tube, pouring water simultaneously. In no time, twenty glasses of ice water are prepared simultaneously.</p>
<p>Unknowingly Adding So Much Wealth: Banks must send account statements to customers at the end of each month. Employees use their left hand to hold an envelope and their right hand to take an account statement, placing hundreds or thousands of statements into envelopes one by one, wasting so much time in the process. If the envelopes are divided into two piles and placed on the table, with the openings facing outwards and the middles held down lightly with an object, both hands can simultaneously take one statement each and insert them into the envelopes on either side. The work can be completed in less than half the time.</p>
<p>Similar examples of increasing efficiency by using both hands simultaneously and reducing unnecessary movements can be studied and implemented at any time in factories, offices, candy stores, and other workplaces that require manual labor. The film presented many comparisons, ending with the sound of a "tick-tock" clock. It tells us: If humans can make good use of every "tick-tock," they can unknowingly create so much more wealth!</p>

<h3 id="e106">National Bank Regulations on the Sale of Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Between Shanghai and Other Ports <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the trading of foreign exchange settlement certificates between Shanghai and other ports, the Central Bank recently notified all designated banks with letter No. 141 to handle matters according to the following procedures.</p>
<p>(1) Foreign exchange settlement certificates from other ports may be sold in Shanghai, and foreign exchange settlement certificates required by other ports may also be purchased from Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) If a designated bank in another port needs to sell foreign exchange settlement certificates, it may telegraph the amount it intends to sell to its Shanghai branch office so that the branch can be responsible for settling the sale with the Central Bank's Business Bureau in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The Shanghai branch office of the designated bank may, based on the above telegram, apply to the Central Bank for a special foreign exchange settlement certificate valid for seven days, to facilitate its sale in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(4) Once the original foreign exchange settlement certificate is sent from the designated bank in another port, it should be immediately submitted to the Central Bank's Business Bureau for cancellation.</p>
<p>(5) After the designated bank in Shanghai purchases foreign exchange settlement certificates on behalf of its branch office in another port, it may submit them to the Central Bank's Business Bureau. Upon submission, the Business Bureau may telegraph the Central Bank's branch in the other port, in order that the branch in the other port can issue special foreign exchange settlement certificates to the designated bank's branch office in that port.</p>
<p>(6) The above procedures are temporarily limited to transactions between Shanghai and other ports. Transactions between other ports are not applicable. The market for trading foreign exchange settlement certificates was very stable yesterday. 540,000 were traded, with HSBC selling the most. The high price of 620,000 from the day before was the result of a direct transaction between buyers and sellers and did not go through a designated bank. A large company sold more than 4,300 US dollars at this high price.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Shortage of Arrivals, Rising Production Costs: Rice Prices Soar, Special High-Quality Japonica Rice Approaches the 10 Million Yuan Mark <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Dragon Boat Festival, rice prices soared wildly, threatening to approach the ten million mark. Yesterday, special high-quality Japonica rice in the North City market reached a new high of 9.3 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). Door-to-door rice shops, after adding a 6% legal profit and transportation costs, reached approximately 9.78 million yuan. Breaking the ten million mark is not far off.</p>
<p>According to relevant sources, the reasons for the recent surge in rice prices are: (1) hoarders are speculating and unwilling to sell; (2) arrivals have been scarce in the past two days, totaling only slightly over 4,000 shi; (3) yesterday morning, a rice boat from Fengjing, carrying 160 shi of rice, was robbed by impoverished people; (4) the wild rise in prices of all goods is stimulating rice prices; (5) rice prices in producing areas are also rising, with Wuxi, Songjiang, and other places reaching 8.5 million yuan per shi.</p>
<p>Flour: Bidding did not commence because economic police were strictly monitoring transactions at the market and inspecting permits. With the prices of all goods rising, the market was strong, but people were afraid of interference from the economic police, so no one dared to call out prices. The bidding session ended without any transactions. In the after-market, old truck and military ship flour were bid at 2.8 million, and large bran at 2.6 million, each rising by about 100,000. The China Trust Bureau continued to release flour at unchanged prices. New wheat was traded at 3.9 million, and old wheat at 4 million.</p>
<p>Grains: Continued to be firm. People remained exceptionally bullish due to the unabated rise in prices of various goods, and sellers were unwilling to sell much. Soybean prices were reported to have risen by 150,000 yuan due to high costs. High-quality Hanzhou miscellaneous beans were priced at 4.8 million. Millet and red sorghum continued to rise by 200,000 yuan under the continued purchases from the northern gangs. Mung beans were being absorbed by the southern Chinese gangs, rising by 3-400,000. New broad beans had fewer customers and abundant arrivals, uniquely falling by 300,000. The price of naked barley also changed little. Sesame increased by 3-400,000. Raw peanuts were traded very little, with raw peanuts from Dawenkou traded at 17.8 million.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: The upward trend continued. People were still bullish, and with easy money and abundant credit, buying was still strong. Most sellers were holding their goods and not selling. Soybean oil opened at 20.08 million, then Dalian soybean oil at 21.1 million, an increase of 1 million. Rapeseed oil rose by 800,000, to 19.8 million. Raw oil and sesame oil from small trucks each rose by 1 million, and soybean cake rose by 12-30,000.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Concerned Parties Analyze Reasons for Loose Monetary Policy <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The June price surge is still in full swing. Although the authorities have been selling materials and tightening credit, there has been no effect so far. According to observations by relevant parties, the main reason for this price surge is the extremely loose monetary policy. The excessive amount of capital in the market is due to the following factors: (1) More than half of the silkworm cocoon loans issued in the spring have now flowed into urban areas, estimated to be over 4 trillion yuan; (2) Due to the overall situation, funds from North China are still flowing south continuously, averaging over 1 trillion yuan per day, mostly in cash, causing frequent receipts and payments in Shanghai's banks and firms; (3) The release of funds by the National Bank, for the Dragon Boat Festival alone, is estimated to be around 1 trillion yuan. (4) Since the ban on post-dated checks, the number of circulating promissory notes has greatly increased. With their function equivalent to large banknotes, the expansion of credit naturally affects prices. The current authorities' hope rests on the US aid materials that are about to arrive. When the materials are sold and distributed in tandem, prices may be temporarily stabilized.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the monetary policy in Shanghai was still extremely loose. The market interest rate was between 0.24 and 0.25. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a net deficit of 550 billion in the clearing of checks and notes. Among them, the Central Bank had a deficit of 64 billion, the Bank of China 419.1 billion, the Bank of Communications 106.9 billion, the Farmers Bank 11.4 billion, the China Trust Bureau 10.1 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau 50.1 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury 11.4 billion. Commercial banks and firms had a net deficit of 247.8 billion in the large exchange and a net surplus of 551 billion in the small exchange. Foreign banks in Shanghai had a total net surplus of 248.8 billion.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by loose monetary policy. Although the China Textile Corporation (CTC) was still distributing a large amount of yarn, the market sentiment was unanimously bullish, and people were scrambling to buy. Outside buyers were particularly eager. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened high at 30 million yuan. Subsequently, due to competition from Tianjin and Guangdong gangs, the market climbed again, closing at 48.5 million yuan, a sharp increase of 5.5 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The remaining 40, 32, 20, 16-count and other coarse and fine yarns uniformly rose by 1.3-4 million and over 10%, respectively.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market had abundant idle funds flowing into Shanghai, and buying interest was exceptionally strong. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped 200,000 yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to the industry's ample capital and vigorous purchases, coupled with large purchases by the Tianjin gang, the market gradually rose to 9.59 million yuan. Around 10 o'clock, when CTC announced the sale of Dragon Head cloth with posted prices, market sentiment calmed down, and there was a lot of short-selling by traders. Customer interest turned dull, finally closing at 9.55 million yuan, continuing to rise by 350,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Four Gentlemen flannel was eagerly absorbed by the Hankou gang, and spot prices rose by 340,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also rose strongly.</p>

<h3 id="e126">The Anglo-Chinese Incident: A Preliminary Resolution Reached <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Jinzhong Issues a Letter Clarifying the Sequence of Events</p>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The conflict between students from Jinhua Anglo-Chinese University and Jinzhong High School has been preliminarily resolved following mediation by officials dispatched by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Director of the Zhejiang Education Bureau. However, Jinzhong High School believes that Anglo-Chinese University's account is inconsistent with the facts. They recently sent a letter to this newspaper stating, in brief: The incident occurred on the evening of May 28th. At that time, our school students were holding a variety show to bid farewell to graduating students. Due to the limited space, guests were generally declined. Several dozen Anglo-Chinese University students forcibly tried to enter, and after repeated dissuasion by our school students and the Director of Moral Education proved ineffective, Headmaster Hu repeatedly explained and apologized, but it was still ineffective. As a last resort, they were allowed to enter. At the time, order in the venue was normal, and there was absolutely no booing. As the first act had just ended, an Anglo-Chinese University student suddenly went on stage and shouted that since Jinzhong High School was not entertaining guests, Anglo-Chinese University students should all leave together. After retreating to the gate, they gathered in increasing numbers, their momentum growing menacing, which then triggered the conflict. When Anglo-Chinese University's Dean of Academic Affairs Cai and others came to the school, they were also unable to stop the students' riot. Later, County Magistrate Yang arrived, but the Anglo-Chinese University students continued to besiege him, trapping him in our school for several hours. The next morning, Commander Chen of the 102nd Brigade of the Army came to the school and genuinely intended to mediate. Headmaster Hu told him that the Anglo-Chinese University students must first stop the attack before negotiating, and there was no truth to the claim that he avoided meeting with them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jinzhong's Shanghai alumni have also published a "Letter to People from All Walks of Life," stating in brief: "Our alma mater's variety show was purely an internal school activity, not a public performance. Anglo-Chinese University students had no right to interfere. Furthermore, Headmaster Hu had already explained politely and even made concessions by allowing them to enter. How could they have engaged in such violent behavior?" They also put forward five demands: (1) Replace the president of Anglo-Chinese University; (2) Severely punish the perpetrators; (3) Compensate for all losses of books, instruments, school buildings, and school equipment, as well as medical expenses; (4) Publicly apologize; (5) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.</p>

<p>[British Information Services, London Dispatch] British female basketball players have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the women's events in the World Games are limited to swimming, track and field, and a few other events. They believe that the International Olympic Committee should include women's basketball and volleyball events, as these two competitions are most suitable for women and are also very popular in the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Scientific Arrangement of the World Games Venue</p>
<p>British scientists, surveyors, electrical, radio, and telegraph engineers are currently busy working for the upcoming Olympic World Games to be held in London. Britain plans to equip the World Games venue with the latest equipment. British scientists are conducting various experiments, such as electrical timing, precision measuring instruments, telephone lines, radio control for races, electrical judging machines, signaling devices, and gas flames illuminating the entire venue, striving for perfection.</p>
<p>New Zealand Athletes Arrive in Britain</p>
<p>The New Zealand team participating in the World Games arrived here at the end of last month, so the team can still train in Britain for nine weeks before the opening of the Games. It is reported that the travel expenses for the team from New Zealand to Britain are approximately 500 pounds per person.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Issue of World Games Commemorative Stamps <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London Dispatch] Britain has always regarded the issuance of stamps as a major industry, and special stamps are especially rare. Therefore, the commemorative stamps to be issued next month to celebrate the 14th World Games will be cherished by stamp collectors and athletes everywhere. The issuance of World Games commemorative stamps has been a long-standing tradition. The new stamps for 1948 will be divided into two and a half pence (ordinary stamps within the Empire), three pence, six pence, and one shilling and four pence. The two highest denominations are suitable for sending overseas airmail. However, these stamps will not be issued until the opening of the Games.</p>

<p>Residents of the Shuidaidian Road and North Baoxing Road Area Write to Appeal</p>
<p>Dear Editor: We live in the Shuidaidian Road area. Because it is remote, thieves are often active at night. Since last year, the streetlights there have not been lit at all. Even the electric lights that we paid to install are like ghost fires, making people feel terrified. Moreover, the company arbitrarily suspends power, so having lights is the same as not having lights. Recently, robberies have occurred frequently in the Shuidaidian Road and North Baoxing Road area. Even a kitchen knife can be used to rob homes. People living in the city cannot imagine that Shanghai has such a terrifying area. The police station recently published in major newspapers that if there are problems with the electric lights in the alleys, it can be reported to the bureau for processing, and power outages should not be used to deal with them, as this affects social security. Your newspaper is the voice of the people. We hope that you will publish this to bring it to the attention of the authorities, and we hope that the company will not privately suspend power anymore. The citizens will be very grateful!</p>
<p>Respectfully, Readers Li Shufu and Liu Dezhong</p>

<h3 id="e156">On Supporting Ourselves <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ji</p>
<p>Anything in the world, once it involves politics, often makes people feel dizzy and unclear about what is being discussed. Let's take the current issue of "opposing American aid to Japan" as an example.</p>
<p>The discussion of this matter has lasted for more than a year, and the arguments from all walks of life have been extremely rich and extremely convoluted.</p>
<p>Some people oppose American aid to Japan because they worry that Japan will rise again, and our country will be the first to suffer. This is a very legitimate and normal reason for opposition. However, they then deviate from this point and oppose raising the living standards of the Japanese people, saying that they have so many spindles, while we only have so many. Because we have less, they dislike that they have more, and the conclusion is that they must be forced to reduce even more than we have, to make our amount appear greater, before they are satisfied. This assumes that we have no hope of increasing our own amount through other methods. Such thinking, if carried to its logical conclusion, would require that Japan be in chaos and that its railways be torn apart. This discussion started with a vertical line, but somehow veered off to one side.</p>
<p>Still other people also advocate opposing American aid to Japan, but somehow their thinking takes a turn, and they suddenly believe that American aid to Japan has ulterior motives, that aiding Japan and aiding China are the same. Since they are already aiding China, they must also have ill intentions. Therefore, while opposing American aid to Japan, they simultaneously shout the slogan of opposing American aid to China. Continuing along this line, it is naturally easy to twist the words and turn the slogan into "anti-Americanism." It started with a discussion of "opposing American aid to Japan," but eventually only the two words "anti-Americanism" remained. This was also a vertical line, which unknowingly veered off to the other side.</p>
<p>This only covers the "discussion." However, in the last ten days or so, this "discussion" has further turned into action, from convoluted and unclear arguments to convoluted and unclear actions.</p>
<p>In this complex and chaotic state, some people think that American aid to Japan is too excessive, some people think that American aid to China is too active, some people think that American aid to China is not ideal, and some people think that the United States should be opposed for no reason. In addition, there are naturally those unambitious and pitiful wretches who willingly admit that their own products will never be able to compete with Japanese goods and are therefore worried that they will not be able to continue to make a fortune. As a result, the situation is becoming increasingly complex.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to the issue of American aid to Japan and China, we should know that countries only consider interests, not right and wrong, and they define right and wrong based on interests. Even if there are acts of assistance between countries, they ultimately stem from self-help. Therefore, if we want others to help us and not help others, we must first seek to have something to offer to others. This is a fact, and it cannot be achieved through empty talk about right and wrong.</p>
<p>What is strange is that among the above-mentioned schools of thought, very few people mention China itself, but today China is precisely the country that most needs to examine itself. Regarding this point, one person who speaks with the clearest mind, I think, is Lu Zhiwei of Yanjing University. He said: "American support for Japan is a matter of degree, and it has not yet reached the point of restoring its aggressive forces. But if the American plan to defend against the Soviets in East Asia fails, then supporting Japan to defend against the Soviets is inevitable... The important thing today is to stand on our own two feet. Isn't everyone bullying China now?" (Shen Bao, 7th) In other words, if we don't stand on our own two feet, even if Japan cannot be used to instigate China, are aggressive countries limited to Japan? Another person is Hu Shih. He said: "Talking about the United States giving a wartime enemy country the opportunity to retain its industry, which has the effect of supporting it, is wrong. We are the country being supported. If we treat support as aiding aggressive forces, wouldn't that be a big mistake?... Because Japan is recovering quickly and China is recovering slowly, we can only worry about ourselves. To be fair, we cannot hope that others will be as unlucky as we are, just because we are unlucky, unprogressive, and not prosperous, so even though it is a legitimate concern, it is a bit abnormal." (Shen Bao, 6th)</p>
<p>Weakening others is by no means the same as strengthening ourselves. We cannot build our national defense on the weakening of other countries' power.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Lost Secrets <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Selfishness is a bad habit of human nature. It is rare to find an inventor who is wise enough to make his inventions public for the benefit of humanity. Most people regard their inventions as their personal treasures, carefully guarding them and keeping them secret, unwilling to reveal them. Once an accident occurs, and the person dies and the method is lost, it is unknown how many people's efforts it will take to rediscover this secret. Sometimes, these inventions are lost forever. Similarly, due to negligent record-keeping or patriotism, many secrets in the field of invention have also been buried.</p>
<p>For example, the Italian priest Lucci Talaniti re-researched the lost ancient method of making colored glass during his lifetime. He gave up his work of proclaiming the holy word and created some of Italy's most beautiful stained-glass windows. However, a year later, in 1862, he unfortunately died of blood poisoning, and the secret pigment he used was lost forever.</p>
<p>Another victim was Adams, the inventor of the exotic metal thallium. In order to find a metal as hard as steel but only half the weight and price of steel, he experimented with electrolysis for more than five years, and as a result, he refined thallium. His fortune immediately prospered, and thousands of tons of orders poured in from various railway companies. But it was too late. Adams was too exhausted physically and mentally and could no longer support himself. He was confined to an asylum. He had never recorded his research process and refused to divulge his secrets. Two years later, he and his secrets passed away together.</p>
<p>In 1895, the Englishman Sambritch invented a revolutionary new explosive that could double the range of bullets. The German government was willing to pay 100,000 yuan to purchase his secret from Sambritch. However, driven by patriotism, Sambritch refused the German government's high-priced purchase and preferred to offer his invention to his own country. However, when the British government was preparing to sign a contract with Sambritch, news came of an explosion in his laboratory—the scientist also died. He left no records, and no one followed, leaving only a dim memory in the history of invention.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Anecdotes about Zhang Xun <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Zhang Xun was a military man, not worth mentioning, but he led the restoration in the sixth year of the Republic, and his name cannot be erased from the history of the Republic of China. The world says that Xun was a minor official (goshha) under Su Yuanchun, but in fact, there were twists and turns in this matter that were not known to people, and Zhang Xun was not his real name. I will now tell the story.</p>
<p>When Zhang was still insignificant, he wandered around the old capital with money. One of the guests in the inn where he lived fell ill. Zhang took care of his medicine and food. When this person was in critical condition, he told Zhang that he was a minor official under Su Yuanchun, ordered to come to Beijing to handle affairs, named Zhang Xun. Now, thanks to his care, he was willing to entrust his affairs to Zhang after his death, and gave him his gongpi (small military official's certificate) and savings. After this person died, Zhang buried him in a public cemetery. He took the name Zhang Xun, handled Su Yuanchun's affairs well, and went to Guangxi to cancel the assignment. Su Yuanchun saw that he was quite talented and kept him in service. From then on, he officially became Zhang Xun. Soon after, Su sent him to Beijing again. Xun became intimate with a male prostitute in Beijing, indulging in sensual pleasures, spending all his money, but the matter was not handled. A friend gave him money to return to Nanchuan. Xun, not afraid of death, arrived in Guangxi late at night and immediately asked to see Su Yuanchun. At that time, Su was taking opium. Xun knelt in front of the bed and reported the whole story. Su did not say anything while indulging in his addiction. Xun knelt for a long time. Suddenly, Su spoke and called to his subordinates to drag him away and chop him up. Xun was held by people to the hall. A person came out and whispered in the ear of the person who was binding Xun, and then said to Xun: "Why don't you run away quickly!" Xun immediately left the city. After walking a few miles, a horse chased after him. Xun thought that his life was still not safe. The rider came to Xun and threw a package, without saying a word, and turned his horse away. Xun opened it and saw it was a silver ingot, weighing a full three hundred taels of silver. From this, Su Yuanchun can also be seen as a character. After Xun's restoration failed, he came out of the Dutch embassy and still lived in the house sold by Xiao Dezhang in Andingmen, the old capital. I visited Wan Gongyu and Zhang Nianci, two friends of his staff, who told me about this matter, saying that Xun did not shy away from it.</p>
<p>Before the Republic, Xun spent a lot of money in Nanjing to buy Xiao Maozi, a famous prostitute in the Qinhuai River. Later, he served as the Yangtze River Inspector, stationed in Xuzhou, and took Wang Keqin, a famous Kunqu opera actress from Tianjin, as his concubine. Keqin entered the house and was favored as his exclusive wife. Xiao Maozi died depressed. Keqin gave birth to a son for Xun. However, when Xun's restoration failed and he took refuge in the Dutch embassy, she swept away everything and fled. There is a couplet in the old capital mocking her, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Looking back on the past, deeply into the barren land, the lonely night is often spent alone."</p>
<p>"The great achievement is the restoration, I fight then I conquer, the zither heart is moved again and elopes."</p>
<p>The couplet contains the names Maozi and Keqin, which is extremely neat and vivid.</p>
<p>Xun held the Xuzhou Conference, united the military governors of various provinces to drive out Li Yuanhong, and led troops into Beijing to restore the dynasty. The National History Museum is responsible for this matter. Now, I will only mention his anecdotes to provide assistance for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Doctrine of Fate <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>Many accidental events are generally associated with fate, and the good or bad of fate, superstitious people will trace back to cause and effect. For example, after a fire, there are deaths and injuries, and some people suspect that their ancestors did not accumulate virtue. Mr. Someone is sixty years old and has no son, and some people think that he has done something bad. If you think this way, it is undoubtedly a cruel mistake.</p>
<p>A person's behavior and fate are not related. The Historical Records of Boyi and Shuqi said that Boqi and Shuqi accumulated benevolence and practiced cleanliness, but they starved to death. Among the seventy disciples of Confucius, Yan Yuan was the only one who loved learning, but Yan Yuan was also poor and died early. The bandit Zhi killed innocent people every day, ate human flesh, was violent and tyrannical, and rampaged through the world, but he died peacefully and lived a long life. I remember a novel by Tolstoy that said that a kind and handsome little merchant once went to the market and stayed in an inn. The next day, he was wrongly accused of being a murderer and was exiled to Siberia, where he spent twenty-six years as a criminal. After twenty-six years, his family was scattered, his hair was white, and his body was bent. He had nowhere to go. — The real murderer was not imprisoned until twenty-six years later. Kind and forgiving people often encounter those tragic fates.</p>
<p>When the Wanli ship hit a reef two months ago, the passengers were rescued to the mountains by the sea. Several women remembered that their clothes and property were all sunk in the sea, and they said to themselves with tears in their eyes: "What bad things have we done? I shouldn't have such bad luck! ... Why did I take this unlucky boat?" I was also on this unlucky boat, and I sunk more than two years of hard-earned savings, worth more than one billion at the time, into the sea. Maybe in the eyes of the rich, it is a small amount, but to me it is a bolt from the blue. But I believe this is not "God's punishment for me."</p>
<p>If you think that all disasters are the result of evil, that error is cruel and immoral. This only makes right and wrong unclear: it makes the unfortunate suffer even more slander and blows. Think about it carefully, and things will be clear. If a person who believes that doing good will surely have good results, he can not go to the air raid shelter during an airplane bombing. For example, if you ask a drunk or an idiot to drive, even with good luck, he will fall out. I believe that behavior and fate are not related, so I am not sad.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Also on the Method of Distinguishing Male and Female Goldfish <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yu</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wu Jiren's article "How to Distinguish Male and Female Goldfish" in this newspaper, I know that Mr. Wu is an enthusiast and has considerable research on goldfish breeding. I would like to provide a brief report on the method of distinguishing male and female goldfish based on my years of experience in breeding, and I hope to attach myself to the achievements of others, which Mr. Wu will surely be happy to allow.</p>
<p>According to the growth ability of goldfish is not weaker than other fish. Breeding for one year, they can reach one foot, which is not a rare thing (research and breeding will be discussed in another article). Generally, the male and female can be distinguished after an inch (about two months), and the judgment can be made based on the length of the body and the shape of the fins and abdomen. Generally, the female fish has a short body and a round abdomen, and the distance from the abdomen to the tail is also shorter than that of the male fish, and there are obvious dividing marks. The four fins are oval and slightly soft; the male fish is not like this: the body is longer than the female, the abdomen is oval, and it is difficult to distinguish between the abdomen and the tail. The four fins are diamond-shaped and hard, and the movement is more lively than the female. Several months before spawning (the spawning period is about March-May every year), silver-colored star spots are grown on the front side of the pectoral fins of the male fish; and when spawning in the spring (fish can have offspring after one year), the female fish's abdomen is naturally large, and the male fish's bright silver stars are particularly bright and lovely. If you carefully play with them, it is not difficult to see at a glance.</p>
<p>As for the method of pressing the abdomen with your hands, it seems that it should not be used often, because in order to promote the development of goldfish, attention must be paid to the hygiene and temperature of the water at any time. Touching with your hands is not only harmful to cleanliness and temperature, but also to the fish's own functions, there is a risk of being inadvertently hindered. In addition, the age of an inch-long fish is only about two months, and the ovary development is not complete. It is difficult to distinguish by just touching it; I wonder what Mr. Wu thinks?</p>
<h3 id="e161">Little Raindrops <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>When walking on the street, in addition to being careful yourself, you must also be careful of other people's carelessness. — It is the same when walking on the street of life.</p>
<p>Hate is a great emotion, but many people hate for fear or jealousy, which becomes humble.</p>
<p>A person who endures pain with a smile is much stronger than a person who complains.</p>
<p>Many women like to moan without being sick. Don't find them annoying. The real "annoyances" are Xi Shi and Lin Daiyu, the two "harmful spirits."</p>
<p>What is called "putting oneself in another's shoes"? — If you don't have coffee and milk yourself, you hope everyone drinks plain boiled water.</p>
<p>The most difficult debt in the world to repay is the one you yourself are most willing and most willing to repay.</p>
<p>If you feel that life is rich enough, then you should pick up better essences. Perhaps, you think that life is empty, and you must never find a lot of useless garbage to fill it.</p>

<p>Clear water suddenly gushed out from the side of the fifth bridge on Qing Shi Road in Shanghai. This may be the trigger of a hidden flow. Geologists can say it. What is gratifying is that the mayor praised it as the "Seventh Spring in the World," which is especially wonderful in the two words "Seventh." According to the usual practice, those associated with "the world" are always "first," such as "the first pass in the world" and "the first landscape in the world," indicating that it is "there can only be one, there cannot be two," that is, the The Only (the only one) commonly used in Western business, saying that it is unparalleled, invincible, and has a particularly high position, which is indispensable. For example, the customs office on the border between Hebei and Kanto is called "the first pass in the world." Jiayuguan, a fortress in the northwest of Gansu, is also called "the first pass in the world." Two "first in the world" seem to be contradictory in theory, but no one wants to be called "second in the world," the so-called difference of a hair, recognition with thousands of miles. As for the "First Spring in the World" on Yuquan Mountain in the western suburbs of Beijing, Emperor Qianlong inscribed it and determined it to be the first, saying: I once made a silver bucket to compare it. The water of Yuquan in the capital weighs one tael; the water of Yixun on the border also weighs one tael; the water of Pearl Spring in Jinan weighs one tael and two li, and the water of Zhuzi Jinshan Spring weighs one tael and three li, which is two or three li heavier than Yuquan; as for Huishan Spring, Hupao Spring, ​​Mountain Spring, Xiaoliang Mountain, Baisha, and Huqiu Springs, they are each four to six li heavier than Yuquan; only snow water is three reeds lighter than Yuquan. Therefore, Yuquan is undoubtedly the first in the world. Such comparison can be said to be extremely concrete and extremely detailed. First is certainly the best, and second is also not bad.</p>
<h3 id="e162">A few days of illness, I was lying in bed upstairs, feeling lonely. Friends came to ask about it, so I composed this poem to express my gratitude. <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>In middle age, I gradually realized that gambling and drinking are wrong. When I was sick, I lay in bed and looked at the curtain. I idly flipped through the Party History and sighed at Niu and Li. I meditated on the talents of the Qin Hui! The swallows in the alley no longer exist, and the doors and windows can be seen. The willow catkins originally entrusted the flourishing world. Living on the upper floors, I feel lonely on all sides, and the medicine bowl is clear, and the strength is weak.</p>
<p>I would rather worry about the red land burying the common people, and the suffering and thinness are tempered into hundreds of refinements. I destroyed the pot and stove after the first summer. I listened to the flutes and drums and changed to new sounds. To adjust my hunger, I eat old and unintentional vegetables. To break the loneliness, the lamps float in a sleepless city, illuminating the Sophora japonica in a sigh, and I vow to be pure and chaste with the accumulated pearls.</p>
<p>The green phosphorescence and white bones cry loudly, and a rain can hardly extinguish the fire. The will of heaven is like a human being, still depressed. The market is not the sea, but it is also turbulent; I hide from the wilderness and steal my breath, and grow moldy. I am lazy to eat and sleep stiffly, and I scratch my short temples. My illness is painfully entangled in the dreams of previous generations, and the famine in the wild says to break into Chenggao.</p>
<p>Ten thousand thoughts are flying, and the couch is restless. How many pitiful people are in my heart. The years are like green beans, and the lamp sheds tears. The temperament is like red pepper, spicy and pure. I dream of a garden as big as heaven. When I wake up, I have no flesh and blood, and my eyes are close! How can I wait to release the Huashan horse? The fire flies and lifts up again, and there is more thorniness.</p>
