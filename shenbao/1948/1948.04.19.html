<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國民大會第十二次大會，十八日晨九時三刻舉行，憲法修改　於會中完成二讀，三讀之程序，獲得通過，完成行憲國大第一項重大任務。本日大會由第八組主席團輪値，于斌主席，出席代表二〇四五人，巳足法定總額三分二之數，宣布開會後，秘書處報吿兩事：甲，宣讀第十一次大會紀錄，乙，主席團報吿擬定總統，副總統投票及開票辦法，至十時一刻開始討論修改憲法案，並由秘書處宣讀第一組審查會審查報吿。繼由第一組審委會召集人張映書，羅文謨分別說明審查會之經渦，王世杰代表主席團說明修憲之程序，略分數點：（一）臨時條款時效有限，不必修憲，且比較方便，盼大會能依照修憲程序通過。（二）在各國亦不乏先例。（三）受國民大會之節制，保障民權。（四）該條款原意爲應付戡亂需要，對任何可以領導戡亂者，應予以信任。繼有田植萍，賈永祥等發言，田植萍認爲，國大必須要有守法與民主之精神，但在審查會時，主席不允發言，且此項審查報吿並非歸納大家意見而成。且臨時條款爲七七一人所提，何能以少數人所提修正意見改變多數人之提案賈永祥亦以審查會時未獲發言機會，認爲係審查會主席不民主。潘公展則就本案加以討論，潘氏提出兩點文字上之修改，亦即對本屆國大的修憲案旣未提付討論，但仍在審查中，故在臨時條款內文字部份應予明白指出，一面使本屆會有所交待，同時說明下次會時，將就修憲案討論。末並說明渠同意審查報告中之修正案一。旋大會休息一刻鐘後復會劉等相繼發言，劉係同意此次修正案者，渠特强調戡亂之重要性。至十一時半，主席宣稱：正反兩面意見壛已有表，旋即開始二讀會，由秘書長逐條宣讀，無異議者即作通過，其中曾有少數人提出意見，十二時五分表決，在塲人數二〇四五，贊成者一七〇八人，已過四分之三，二讀會通過。旋繼續三讀會，全案付表決，在場二〇四五人，贊成者一六二四人，全案毫無修正，照原案通過（審查報吿全文見十八日本報第一版）主席宣布散會，時爲十二時七分。</p>

<h3 id="c14">國大紀程　提綱挈領修憲完成 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕從這次國大開幕前夕起，一直到十七日第一審查委員會散會時止，醞釀於代表間的一股主流，便是修憲。在討論議事規則時，在討論大會日程表時，代表們爭取修憲的機會，代表們要求提前修憲的討論時間，甚至有一位代表大呼：「我們一定要先討論修憲，然後選舉，否則選舉完成，代表走散，修改憲法人數便不足了！」一讀會和兩天審查會中的噓聲，呌囂，爭執和混亂，目的雷同：修改憲法。若干代表則持相反的意見，反對修改。修憲案提出來，六件合法提案中的四件是局部小問題，祇有張知本和莫德惠兩案是重要修改。張知本主張增加國大的創制，複決兩權及國大二年召開一次，莫德惠主張增加動員戡亂時期臨時條款，予總統以緊急應變大權。審查會以兩天的四塲混亂紛爭，換得了綜合性的審查報吿，提綱挈領，容納了兩案的精神與實質，制定動員戡亂時期臨時條款四款，提出十八日上午的第十二次大會。蔣主席先以國府主席資格坐在主席台上，後以人民代表資格坐在代表席次，他領導着全塲的肅靜和秩序，使二讀三讀在一個上午的大會中順利通過，完成了修憲的程序。</p>
<p>爲修憲問題而起的紛爭，以十六日上下午爲最甚。上午王培基的「大代表，小代表，大代表代表小代表簽署，」下午湯志先的「盲從」，曾引起兩次軒然大波。蔣主席以「人民之一」的資格向各代表「貢獻」的意見，發生了效力。雖然審查會最後還有人提出「明天再說」，可是十八日上午並沒有人堅持「再說」，也沒有人支持「再說」。十二次大會由于斌主席。在主席團中，于斌是比較能控制會塲的。這位力大聲洪的主席執行職務時，主席台上還坐有國民政府主席，使他獲得意外的順利。總統副總統投票及開票辦法的報吿和討論未引起任何風波，台上人容納了台下人的，不代表出席證上蓋鬥章的意見。第一審委會召集人張映書·羅文謨和主席團王世杰·王寵惠的說明與解釋，帮助了討論的順利。廣泛發表意見時，田植萍又質詢：（一）何以審查報吿草案在事先印就？（二）何以審查報吿推翻張知本的提案？（三）取消修改憲法應該由大會決定，何以由二百六十三人的審查會決定？賈永祥說：「我主張修改，可是我接受蔣總裁的意旨，不再提出」。他大聲指責昨天審查會主席林彬違法，剝奪代表的發言權。他們發言時，台下有人鼓掌，也有人噓。潘公展的具體修正意見，則博得多數掌聲。休息後，湯志先·劉守剛·劉家樹·李仲琳發言，却已引起過多的注意。</p>
<p>爲了能在上午至少完成二讀程序，于斌在十一時半時，當機立斷，用表決器宣判討論停止，以在塲二〇四五人中的一七二九人的贊同，進行二讀逐款朗讀議決。洪蘭友奉命宣讀條文，第一款平靜無波，順利通過；第二款被李鴻儒·張家鼎等打斷了，可是于斌將他們主張刪除第二款的意見付表決，祗有二一四人贊同，不能成立。第三款和第四款也很順利，第四款的修正案，依法不能成立。於是于斌再度使用表決，以一七二八人的同意，通過了二讀。若干代表以爲就要散會，紛紛起立，但于斌却毫下停留地宣付三讀，就議案作整體的表決。五色繽紛的表決器又亮了，三讀程序以一六二四人的同意，獲得通過。</p>
<p>審查報告的主旨，是提綱挈領地解決了修憲的紛爭，除了授總統以應變之權，是全體一致之外，關於修憲，則在條款中規定，將於兩年八個月後的臨時大會中討論。所有修憲提案，等於是保留了。祗有唯一的修改，便是總統在戡亂期間可以不爲憲法第卅九條和第四十三條的規定所限制。</p>
<p>審查報吿三讀通過時，是四月十八日正午十二時零七分。第一次國民大會第一次會議，算是完成了第一項重要任務——修改憲法。而明天，正如洪蘭友所報吿的，將是選舉中華民國的第一任總統了。（四月十八“於南京）</p>

<h3 id="c16">社論　預祝蔣主席當選總統 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>國民大會公告總統候選人後，即將於今晨九時起開始投票，並將當塲隆重開票，預料至本日正午，中華民國第一任總統就可以分曉了。這次國大選舉總統，不僅是國大完成其基本任務，而且也是我國政治走上民主憲政之途的第一步，凡是願見中國和平，民主，統一强大的人士，無不重視這一次的總統選舉，更無不希望我國唯一的最高領袖蔣公爲中華民國的舵手，使這一艘在驚濤駭浪之下的破船，能安然渡到彼岸。看看一般的趨勢，觀察各方面的情形，蔣主席當選第一任總統，是絕對無問題的了。所以，我們先在這裏預祝蔣主席當選第一任總統，並願乘此機會一述蔣主席當選總統的重大意義：</p>
<p>第一，蔣主席當選總統不能視爲國民黨一黨的勝利，而應視爲全國各黨派及無黨派者大團結的成功。蔣主席不僅是國民黨的總裁，而且已是全國的最高領袖；他曾堅決表示不願爲國民黨的總統候選人，並曾以偉大政治家的謙讓風度，自己從未作實際的競選，這就是他對於全國人民是否眞正擁護他的一種考驗。但是全國人民，不論黨派，不分南北，莫不一致表示熱烈擁護，國大代表速署蔣主席爲總統候選人者，達二四八九人，幾佔國大代表總額的百分之九十五。所以今日蔣主席當選總統，就是他已是超黨派的全國領袖的明證。</p>
<p>第二，我國憲法雖規定總統不負實際行政責任，但由蔣主席當選總統之後，他仍是引導國家走入坦途的最高舵手。誰都知道最近廿五年來，蔣主席的豐功偉績，固爲我國歷史上所僅見；就是將主席的日夜辛勞，也非任何人所能及其萬一。溯自北伐以來，打倒軍閥，完成統一；接着對外抗戰，戰勝日寇，廢除一切不平等條約，貫澈了民族主義的全部目的；勝利後又積極推行憲政，假如沒有共匪的禍國殃民，國民革命的目的，平就可以全部完成了，我們也願勞苦功高的領袖，能有功成身退的一天；但是目前的情形，萬方多難，危機四伏，非仍由蔣主席出任艱鉅不足以打開當前的難關。故因事實上的需要，使蔣主席當選總統後仍爲國家的最高舵手。</p>
<p>第三，蔣主席的當選總統，實爲我國民主憲政最可靠的保障。蔣主席不僅具有我國古聖先賢的傳統精神，他不願高居權位而不負責任；抑且富於現代民主風度，一方面能容忍別人的批評，另一方面還能尊重少數黨的意見。前年國大對於兩種憲草發生爭執的時候，國民黨祗有將主席是贊成依照政協決議而起草的憲法的；這次國大對於修憲問題，又引起軒然大波，國民黨也只有蔣主席一人反對修改憲法。所以我們認爲蔣主席是國內忠於憲法而忠於行憲的第一人，在他當選總統後，對於中國政治一步步走上民主憲政的坦途，無異坍加了一重有力的保障。第四，蔣主席的當選總統，是中國政治革新的先聲。我們預料到國大閉幕之後，民選的立法院就要繼起開會，由總統提出行政院長的人選，獲得立法院同意後，也就可組織的政府了，以後不論採取什麽內政，外交，財政，金，都要視民意爲依歸。總統雖不負實際行政責任，但是總統仍是引導國家前進的最高舵手，我們相信民選的政府必能一改過去無能與食汚的習氣，而能與民更始。</p>
<p>我們行見我國的歷史將展開最光榮燦爛的一頁，特在此預祝蔣主席當選中華民國第一任總統！</p>
<h3 id="c17">義大利開始普選 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>舉世矚目的義大利四月普選，已自昨日起開始投票了。全開分設四萬一千大百四十八個投票處，均在軍警森嚴的戒備之中，讓一般善良的選民自由投他最神聖的一票，截至本文發稿爲止，義國各地的空氣雖極緊張，但未發生嚴重事件，預料這次普選不致遭受妨害而宣告暫時停辦；據執政黨基督民主黨領袖喀斯貝里的表示，渠相信這次普選的結果，一定優於一九四六年的六月普選。但是最後結果的揭曉，最早也要在二三天之後，現在各方面所作的猜測，都不免言之過平，非到最後揭曉，都是不可確信的。</p>
<p>義國這次普選，要選出五百七十個衆議員及二百三十七個參議員，議員的任期是兩年，換句話說，這次普選的結果如何，足以決定義大利最近兩年的政治。在民主世紀，各國舉行普選，本來是一件極平常的事情，用不到這樣的重視；但是在今日世界兩極化的過程中，義國普選不僅在義國國內，引起了左右兩派政黨的劇烈競爭，而且在國際上，也引起了兩大集團的鬥爭，將其冷戰的重心移至義大利半島。</p>
<p>我們看一般的趨勢及各方面的情形，這次普選的結果，基督敎民主黨或能壓倒義共及其同路人，仍獲得勝利，賡續執政二年，但是喀斯貝里內閣的前途，仍是未可樂觀的。因爲義國是一個地脊民貧的島國，戰前依靠海外的殖民地，衣食所需，尙能自足自給；但是戰後的義大利，一則受戰爭的摧毀，不易恢復元氣，再則所有的殖民地均一被剝奪，衣食所需物資的來源，均已中斷。因此不論是國家財政或是人民的生活，均陷於極度的困難。在這種情况之下，僅靠外援是不足以克服困難的；義國的更生，仍要靠自己的力量。而喀斯貝里政府執政多年，毫無政績可言，使義國人民大失所望；即使此次普選獲勝，在今後的兩年之中，如仍不能充分利用美援，作爲自力更生的基礎，使義國的經濟復興，則兩年之後，現政府勢必垮台，也就無法挽救的了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕警備司令部警備大隊日前又破獲一大規模毒品製造機關，搜獲毒品嗎啡約二百餘兩，鴉片約十餘斤之鉅。茲將破案經過探誌如下：本月十六日上午稽查處長鄭重爲接得密報稱，金陵中路二〇六弄仁昌里六號三樓房客蔡子英，有製造毒品嫌疑。鄭處長即呈報宣司令批示交警備大隊路鵬大隊長澈底破案。路大隊長奉令後，即派第一分隊長許孝華率領大批幹員，於十六日下午三時，按址前往搜查，果然抄出巳製成嗎啡三大盒，及朱製成之原料十餘盒，及大批製造器具。當塲拘獲主犯蔡子英及嫌疑犯蔡陳運娥，蔡素琴，邵黃氏，邵螢揚，邵依人，鄭宏維等七人。經帶隊嚴鞫，供出該毒品原料來自寗海東路二四號振大典當老闆劉老三。許分隊長乃即根據口供，率領機動車隊馳往振大典當，搜出已製成嗎啡一盒，逮捕嫌疑犯劉永基，陳堯山，蔡振茂，劉錫坤，劉楚賢等五人。老闆劉老三則離滬在逃。警備人員乃復至望亭街一〇四弄五號劉老三住家，搜出嗎啡原料及製造毒品之器皿等物，逮捕嫌疑犯周定人一名。又至露香園路四十四號福利典當內逮捕販毒嫌疑犯鄭子川，鄭玉橋，鄭瑞堂，鄭介之，陳良淑，鄭仁海，鄭國志等七人。以上各犯經帶隊部詳細審問後，除蔡子英，鄭子川，鄭玉橋，陳良淑等四人承認製造毒品或經售吸食外，鄭國志，鄭仁海雖予否認，但據陳良淑口供，則有參與販毒嫌疑。蔡子英之妻蔡陳運娥知情隱匿不報，與禁治烟毒條例顯有抵觸。七犯一併定於今日連同毒品等解送警備部審辦。其餘十三人輕調查尙無來涉，均予保釋</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美西太平洋艦隊總司令白青爾中將，於昨日上午十一時在海軍總部招待記者，美駐華海軍顧問團團長塞爾柏及美總領事葛柏德均列席。席間白中將表示渠於二十五年前即曾來華，當時與我國海軍老將薩鎭冰等均極友好。除海軍界人士外，白氏各方中國友人均極多，故謂渠認識中國情形頗深，同情中國，竭願帮助中國。</p>
<p>白中將又稱，第七艦隊目前在中國主要工作在協助美援華物資運華，但卸貨工作頗爲困難，因缺乏鐵路等交通工具，致工作進行未能如預期之迅速。原定在滬每日卸貨八千噸，但上海碼頭僅能卸三千噸，而此三千噸有時亦不易全部辦到。此項物資中包括糧食，工業用機器，船隻等·因白氏工作須赴各處指揮或視察，故其總部雖設靑島，渠經常在太平洋各地往返。</p>

<p>福民輪船公司萬里輪在嵊山擱淺各情，迗本報。昨日該公司負責人對萬里輪失事經過及現在情形發表鄭重聲明如次：「萬里輪於本月十一日由津駛滬，十二日上午過北嵊山大陸山脚下擱淺。本公司接獲遇險消息，立即請中美海軍當局。及國營招商局請予協助，設法營救，因本公司另一船隻長城輪係油船，柴油一時未及配到，故不能行駛。自十三接得招商局錫麟輪蔡船長電吿，證明旅客船員全部安全登陸後，巳派專員分飛靑島天津進行，全船人員設法歸滬一切迭見各報記載。至於萬里輪所載旅客，例有全部名單及船票票根可以複按。該輪係一九四四年英國造新船，本公司駛用以來，僅五個月，其行駛規程，均遵照航政局規定，受合法檢驗，領有航行執照，以前經常往來津滬，自有公正批評。本公司在萬里輪出事後，係包用中央航空公司專機，由經理楊德川會同旅客家屬代表飛靑轉赴烟合，就近設法，並且設立招待所，其營救心切，事實俱在。至最近止，每日接有靑津烟台電報數起，並有一部份旅客已到烟合，足證營救後之消息，不斷而來。本公司長城輪雖在缺油，爲全力加强善後工作，亦在竭盡設法，可於二十日由津直駛烟台，準備迎接旅客回滬，深恐眞相不明，特爲發表經過」</p>

<h3 id="c80">集郵不乏掌故史實　吉光片羽價值連城　我國最早的郵票出現在光緒四年 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕集郵在上海曾經盛極　一時，現在則已大不如昔。很多潛心於郵票掌故的研究和收藏的人，因爲生活艱澀，大都已放棄了他們的愛好；聽兩個集郵家閒談一點集郵史實和現况，實在有無限蒼茫的感覺。</p>
<p>中國最早的郵票出現在光緖四年，當時是由滿淸政府委託海關代辦，分一分銀，三分銀，五分銀三種，票面圖案非常簡單，上端橫印「大淸」兩字，當中一條巨龍，龍右方有「郵政局』三字，龍左方則印銀數，當初因爲印刷術不精，圖案都是逐枚用手工離成，所以龍身週圍的雲彩，以及龍爪的地位，邊綠的闊狹，多少總有點差異，這些，到今日都成了集郵家們鑑賞和論價的標準。這種「大龍郵票」流傳數目有限，其中或許有印刷模糊不淸，岡案綫紋中斷，甚至字體筆劃稍有短長的，集郵家更奉爲　寳，方寸廢紙，每枚時價最低需美金六元，最高要美金五百元以上。</p>
<p>國郵孤品珍藏舊物</p>
<p>在清末發行的郵票當中，紅色三分印花改印成一圓的郵票，現在巳號稱東半球最罕貴的國郵孤品，據集郵家考證結果，這種郵票發行總數不滿四十枚，四十枚中除了上下橫印「大淸郵政」和「Idollar」字樣完全相同外，正中加蓋的黑色「當一圓」三字，據說還分大小字體兩種，小字「當一圓」的票面更是寥寥無幾，去年上海發現了一方，竟是四張相連尙未用過的新票，結果爲永紗總經理郭植芳購去，是出以相當於金條卅根的代價成交的。後來經考證這方郵票還是最早爲我國設計郵票圖案的棣維拉氏珍藏舊物。</p>
<p>去年底名郵商吳樂園從國外交換到一張爲集郵家們夢寐企求的稀品，那是民國三年財政部印刷局印製的伍圓郵票，票面中的北京宮門圖案不知怎的被倒印了，因爲是倒印，也因爲據考證這種倒印的郵票總數祗有四十九枚，更因爲四十九枚中有一枚當時就被破壞毀棄了，所以發現了一枚怎不令人驚異？結果未逾一月，就被人以相當於十餘根金條的代價購去。</p>
<p>至寶到手喜出望外</p>
<p>去年春間重慶有一個小學生，用二萬元壓歲錢向郵局集郵處買了半分起到二十元止一的各種郵票每留五十張，回　後發現其中二十九年美閱鈔議　　肢的二元郵票，當中的總理像竟是倒印，這小學生的父親是玩過集郵的，明知至寳到手，這一喜眞非同小可，後來消息傳出，終於間訊者紛至沓來，當然又是善價而沽，每張高達美金六百元。這種郵票印成於二十九年，到三十六年纔發現倒印，而且倒印的藍黑二色又與宮門倒印的套色相同，所以爲集郵界頻添了一段珍貴史話。</p>
<p>全世界最古的郵票是一八四〇年英國維多利亞皇朝的一便士黑色票，但是由於數量相當多，流傳較廣，舊票祗値美金五元，新票每張亦不過三十五元。</p>
<p>稀世珍郵盜攜走</p>
<p>唯有英屬幾亞那（Guisns）的一分郵票，則爲世界郵票孤品，現在國際間所熟知的祗有一張，很久以前據說也是從一個小學生手中以一千〇六便士流出的，後來轉輾入海恩特夫人之手，她再以三萬七千五百美金的高價賣給美國亙商格萊姆，去年底格寓遭受盜刧，　盜進門，略未他顧，就一拳將格擊昏，挑走這張稀世珍品，到目前止還不知下落。這張郵票票面的構圖，僅有帆船一艘，黑　兩　，毫無美感，但在去年紐約美郵百年紀念國際郵展會上，它却佔了一個異常顯著而又特殊的地位，標價美金五萬元，是全塲最貴的一張郵票。</p>
<p>幾個中外集郵專家</p>
<p>中國最近也是最新發行的一種郵票，就是郵政紀念日印出的五千元票額，它包括兩種紀念性的圖案，右方是中華民國光復紀念一角票，左方是郵政總局成立五十週紀念五百元票，民國史上最早與最近的郵票都包含在內，據說這種圖案的設計是郵局徇集郵家建議而製成的。集郵家在每一種新票發行時大量購積，是郵局一筆主要的收入來源　提起集郵家，人們都容易聯想到故羅斯福總統，前英皇喬治第五，英公主伊麗莎白，其實中國幾個集郵家在國際間也頗有點聲譽的，像巳逾花甲的周今覺，專收近代票的鍾笑爐，專收名貴票的郭植芳，新光郵誌和郵典的主編人張賡伯，順昌水泥廠總經理馬任全，江蘇省銀行總經理許伯明，名郵商嚴西嶠·吳樂園·陳復祥。</p>
<p>寢饋於斯渾忘一切</p>
<p>他們對集郵幾乎都巳成爲一種痼癖，　饋於斯，渾忘身外一切。他們每鑑定一種郵票，郵票的發行數量，紙質厚薄顏色深淺，字形變體，以及四週齒孔的多寡，都是決定其優劣貴賤的標準。普通一張郵票每邊一英尺的齒孔是十四度半，假使承印郵票的廠家在刺孔時偶然地誤用了另一種刺孔機，而使絕對少數的票面，變成了十二度或是十一度半，那　　郵票立刻名登「郵乘」（周仿鱟編的集郵雜誌）價値連城，就成爲海內外集郵家亟欲到手而後快的名件了。</p>

<h3 id="c91">一般物價波動幅度減少進入間歇時期 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>陰曆年關後物價大彼動，到三月份第二週進入最高潮。各項物價指數上升之百分數，均甚猛烈，隨後物價波動幅度逐漸减小，銀根趨緊，似已進入大波動後之間歇時期。此種狀態持績至四片份第一週，歷時約三屋期之久，至前週，即四月份第二週，週初承前期疲勢，物價仍甚平穩，嗣因證交遞延交割奉令停做，外匯放長，本市公用事業漲價等因素之影響，又掀起漲風。就本刋最近數週批發物價總指數觀之，計三月份第三週上升百分之六，第四週上升百分之四·四，四月份第一週上升百分之一·九，第二週上升百分之三·一九，比較均甚平穩，此番物價漲風展緩之原因及其詳情，已於以前各期本刋分別詳述。</p>
<p>上週一般物價，自週一起，較前週末，再現疲勢，惟週四因市塲方面，謠傳外匯再度放長，不無刺激，一般物價，略趨回漲。上週銀根仍甚鬆濫，週一週二暗息站定二角五分，週三以後，略見好轉，在二角五分至二角七八分之間。根據過去經騐，此種情勢，對於一般物價漲風，本有一觸即發之勢，但上週物價，大體言之，均尙稱平穩。分析其原因，要不外本刋以前谷期所指出如美貸成功，出售國營事業，發行短期國庫劵諸端發展之漸形具體化。分別言之，第一，美貸方面，自美總統簽署援外法案後，已進入實施階段，最近我國駐美顧大使及孔祥熙氏與美國務卿之接觸，及貝祖貽氏有即將返國之　，均顯示美貸使命，即可完成。再就顧大使與美當局洽談情形看來，美貸在實施上似尙缺「意見信」一項手續，該項手續為美貸款計劃所規定條件之一，刻中國政府一俟接獲美國務部之此項通知，即將提出其意見書·第二，出售國營事業方面，據財政部俞部長於十三日向國大報吿稱，最近已擬有出售國營事業充實法幣準備辦法，將中紡公司資產中，劃出價値二億美元之產業，招商局資產中，劃出價値一億美元之產業，資源委員會之資產中，劃出價値五千萬美元之產業，日本賠償物資之一部份中，劃出價値八千萬美元之產業，總計四億美元以上。至各該單位對該項劃出之產業，亦在積極準備辦理估價及發行股票手續，如中紡公司餈產估價委員會十二日會議已通過該公司靑島，天津二處資產估價（上海部份早經通過），其中機械，原動及建築部份之估價，以廿六年為基準，地產部份以三十六年為基準，其各項數字如下：（一）機械原動及建築二十六年估價：上海九一，八〇〇，七四八元靑島五五，一二三，七五八元，天津四五，五九六，七〇八元，總計一九三，五二一，二一四元。地產三十六年估價：上海二〇，四五二，一五八萬元，靑島一，〇三一，九六三萬元，天津二，六五一，四三九萬元，總計二四，一三五，五六〇萬元。招商局估價事宜，亦在籌備進行中。第三，發行短期國庫券方面，該項發行條例，已於十五日由立法院會議正式通過，條文要點，據說中央銀行可視市塲需要情形發行，不限數額，另在市塲上得折　出售，或到期　予收回·上述諸因，均爲勝利以來，經濟上不常見之重大變革，一且付諸實施，其影響自　重視。故在目前情形下，市場上反皇現一片較爲沉寂景象，實因買賣雙方大戶，際此經濟上大變動之前夕，咸具戒心　　，以致暫抱觀望態度。綜括言之，上週實山雨欲來前之暫時寗靜時期。此外政府在上週努力於有關平抑物價的措施大約有：（一）關於自備外匯，准予部份開放，以輸人工業原料，生產器材一案，據輸管會消息，此項新措施，目前已至決定階段，日內即可公佈實施，吾人展望此項措施一旦實施後，其影響當不限於輸出入業本身而已；（二）軍政機關的公款應存放國庫，早經政府通飭在案，最近更令飭三行兩局，對於機關存款應移存國庫，幷須接受央行之檢查，國庫局因此在京滬增設收支處所，據稱辦理情形，頗為順利；（三）財政部令飭上海金融管理局，限止行莊票據當日抵用，用意所在，不過想藉减少通貨的週轉率以延緩物價上漲罷了；（四）去年年底政府為平抑物價，停止貸款，以後又為協助工商業融通資金，渡過難關起見，辦理收購成品，現該項收購之成品，傳中央信託局有即將標售消息，此舉對於扳持貨物者及市上游資，頗堪玩味；（五）民食調配委員會收購食米之說，又甚囂塵上，大有勢在必行之勢，此舉在民調會方面，為調節市塲而收購，固振振有詞，但吾人從整個市塲着眼，不景氣狀况，豈僅糧食一行乎。於此吾人憶及去年四月初以迄六月初勝利後之物價第四次大彼動，總指數上升百分之六十四，當時領　漲價物品·賠償爲　　量收購之食糧，撫今追營，能不談虎色變，甚望政府對此重要之民生必需品，審愼處理之。</p>
<p>上週物價，在前述密雲不雨的狀况下，一般走勢，起伏均不甚大，未見新價。紗布方面，如四十二支藍鳳始終盤於二億三千萬邊緣，十二磅龍頭細布自週一之四百八十萬跌至週四之四百七十一萬，週五起回至四百七十七萬，波動幅度，不出十萬元。糧食方面，上白粳自週一之三百七十五萬跌至週三之三百六十五萬·週四回至三百七十萬，係因天雨，到貨較少關係，週五起因蘇錫產地米價報漲，幷傳民食調配委員會又有收購之說，再見回漲，北市塲價，達三百八十五萬，食油雜糧走勢與米糧略同。餘如建築材料，化學品，金屬等，僅略見榮辱，彼動幅度均小。　上週批發物價指數按用途分類者如次：</p>

<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>上週本市銀根，雖緊歛之象屢顯，但以一般市况平疲，頭寸之需未見十分股切，反之在頭寸的供給方面，國庫支出浩繁如舊，國家行局一週來雖頗有差進，但進數不大，此其一。各地匯款流入本市者頗多此其二。再者即足以帮助抽緊銀根的工具，如出售於去年農歷年底所收購的廠商成品，國庫券的發行及出售國營事業等，均尙在擬議之中，此其三。這三種原因都不能使市塲頭寸的供給有所减少，因此一週來本市銀根，大致表現出欲緊還鬆的趨勢。　先就上週國家行局的交換差額來看，自週一至週五國家行局的交換總額雖共為一萬〇三百五十一億的差進，但如以五天內商業銀行交解央行的存款共八千二百五十億扣除不計，則國家行局的實際差進不過二千億，對於抽緊銀根的作用自甚微弱。</p>
<p>至於一週來本市的暗息，週四週五等天，雖有做到三角的高價者，但並不普遍而且未幾即見下降，一週來大致以做二角七八分者為最多，至證券帮塲外貼息，大抵穩定於十六元與十九元之間，波動不大。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，頭寸亦見綏和，同業拆放雖頗有做開，但以供源旺盛而不感困難，六十號以後交換行莊，自週一至週五五天共計差出一萬二千三百六十七億，其間以週一週四各差出四千餘億為最鉅，週二之差出不渦八百多億，行莊五天內為抵補單子而解繳央行之現款數在三千五百億左右，為數亦不能算鉅，行莊頭寸之鬆和又可得一證明。</p>
<p>上週外商銀行之差進額又見增加，自週一至週五五天內共差進七千〇四十億，每天之進額均在千億以上，而以週四差進二千二百七十二億為最多，其間除一部份係商業行莊所歸償的拆款外，據悉大部係南流之匯款，至堪注目。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外匯行市，基準率雖一度盛傳又將掛高，但經平準基金會方面加以鄧重否認，據稱『外匯決不致再調整』而吿平息，美英匯率均維持原盤各為三十二萬四千元及九十七萬二千元，香港申匯一週來亦頗見穩定，週四以前維持於法幣十萬元合港幣八角八九分的水準，香港美鈔市價亦穩定於一美元合港幣五元六角四五分之間，較前週末五元七角六分市價稍見减縮。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>上週一般銀根雖尙稱鬆和，但利多之因素不多，香港申匯始終維持於八角八九分之間，外匯基準率雖一度風傳掛高，但未幾即為基金會當局否認。再者當局對出售國營事業一事，似推行不遺餘方，為符合民問資方起見，中紡公司各單位有個別出售的消息，而上年年底所收購的廠商成品，亦頗有拋出之勢，短期國庫券發行條例，又經立法院正式通過，種種跡象，都可能說明當局對抽緊銀根一點，頗具決心，這些現象無異在股市的前途上加上了一重暗影，大戶不願收吐，散戶亦多觀望，一週來華股走勢雖尙見平疲以至穩定，但如以上週週五之收價與前週週五的相較，各股有軋跌一成以上者，其間永紗約跌百分之八，景綸軋跌一成，中絲跌百分之十二，信誼約跌半成，其他各股亦莫不一致見軟，即就上週週一至週五五天以內之過程而論，各股雖無甚大起伏，但走勢疲軟乏力。</p>
<p>外股走勢，亦　疲態，一週來起伏幅度，頗為狹窄。怡紗始終在二四〇萬與二六〇萬之問盤旋，會德豐英聯亦祗有二三十元上落。業中人俱意興不濃，港匯報縮有限，銀根雖稱鬆濫，而拆息仍未見低，遂致成交數額减少。其他金融性商品於上週一致盤挫。外匯掛牌不動，亦頗足影響外股之呆滯。但此瘟伏狀態，恐僅屬短時間之現象，蓋洋股究屬以港幣為單位，與華股相較，所受限制少，且不受通貨膨脹之影響，將來當有不平衡之發展也。再者，華股屢經增資，股票數額膨脹，幾與通貨相媲美，而洋股始終保持原形，物以稀爲貴，且爲資金逃避一捷徑，在大環境波動之際，常為洋股開路此當注意及之。</p>

<p>棉紡織業逆境中的國營紗廠出售</p>
<p>本月十日，舊金山聯合社發表了一則關於遠東問題專家談話的電訊，說明美國合併援外法案項下對華援助，因數日微小，不能供長期復興，該專家復認為中國幣値即將繼續跌落，甚且完全崩潰，結語為在內戰消耗停止以前，雖發行新幣，前途亦難樂觀。但我們週知，所謂「戡亂」，乃當今政府已定的「國策」，自難改變，而且為再作進一步的努力，正如十三日俞財長在國大會議上的財政報吿中所聲稱者，政府最近已擬有出售國營事業資產，充實法幣資產的辦法，亦即將中紡公司資產中劃出價値二億美元之產業，招商局資產中劃出價値一億美元之產業，資源委員會之資產中，劃出價値五千萬美元之產業及賠償物資中約値八千萬美元之產業交由中央銀行設立專賬，作為法幣準備金之一部份，在這個法幣準備的新基礎上，顯然政府又可作七十萬億發行以外的新活動了。</p>
<p>爲積極推行上面所說的出售國營事業起見，紡建公司資產估價委員會特於十二日下午三時在該公司會議室舉行末次會議，確定了該公司靑島天津二處資產的估價，至於本市的部份則早經通過，其間機械，原動，及建築部份之估價以廿六年為基準，三地共値一禽九千三百餘萬元，地產部份之估價以卅六年為基準，三地共値二千四百餘億。至於上述估價數字應如何折合美金，該會提出兩項辦法，供當局參考，第一為根據廿六年美元與法幣之比率，將上述數字折合美金，第二法為將估價數字根據物價指數先行升値，再按現行美元與法幣之比率折合美元。又按中央規定，紡建公司資產三分之二出讓民營，三分之一仍保留爲國營，此三分之二的價値，估計約可折美金二億元之鉅，如果出讓民營，的確是一筆空前的買賣，茲據悉紡建公司　　　　　　　　　　　　股權產權等，正分別移轉中央銀行，由中央銀行接收，並按國務會議所通過辦法，辦理發行股票或出售事宜。中紡部份，據悉巳定於下月十五日正式發行股票。至發行事宜乃委託中國銀行代辦</p>
<p>茲僅就出售中紡約二億美元價値之資產予居營一點而論：在一般民生日見凋敝的今天，此種股權產權的去路頗堪注意，股權之半數以上如為外來勢力操縱或受國內少數豪門資本支配，則對一般國計民生，不惟無益，恐將為害無窮。</p>
<p>如就月前民營廠商的資力說，果然可說明廳大的國營事業非一般民間資本力量所能承購，再如以最近本市工廠南遷盛行這一點來說，國營事業之是否能順利銷售民間，亦足資疑問。據華東社消息在本市經濟動盪激列聲中，工商界因難於繼續維持紛紛南遷者頗多，其中即以紡織廠一類而言，最近遷往香港，廣州，華南各地區者，已有十家左右，申新紗廠於前週末運紡織機械七百噸至廣州裝置運用，該社又報導某工業界權威人士之談片，略謂由於戰事經濟之不安定，滬市工廠南遷已成為一時之風氣，惟其遷移之辦法各有不同，全部機械器材南遷之工廠目前雖尙無發現，惟聞若千廠商已在作準備工作，部份南遷者已有數家，其重心將絡續南移，尙有一部份廠商在美訂購之新機器原擬運滬裝置作擴充範圍應用者，均改途直接運往廣州香港卸貨，在該區設廠經營云云。</p>
<p>如此說來，民間資本在承購國營事業以後，大可向華南遷移，以求發展，但實際情况並不如相像之簡單，姑置搬運，裝置等鉅大費用不論，即使能順利以國營企業拆卸南遝，所惜今日之華南局面亦已非昔比，本市金融日報曾於上週週四刊載廣州航訊一則，略謂「廣州工廠大部停止生產，因存貨太多而無法出售，影響工業原料市塲淸淡，工廠輸入配額亦無人願承購……由於港幣瘋狂上漲，永無止境，使購買力頓咸，更因為了防止游資南下之法規影響，（每人入穗限帶五千萬一元）遂使湘漢桂贛等客帮近月來均不敢南下買賣，入口檢查甚嚴，眞正南流之游資仍未能堵塞，商業週轉之資金因此而遭斷流，於此不難工廠全部停工，廣州商業亦恐在狂風暴雨下凋零也。」</p>
<p>民營紗廠的境遇決定了國營紗廠可能售讓的限度，關於本市紗廠因原棉缺乏而構成嚴重危機一節，本刋已歷有綜述。原棉的供應，除仰賴外棉的輸入外，尙靠棉商方面向產棉區收購國棉，本市棉商承購棉花聯營處某負責人加以抨擊，紗管當局乃於上週週★■發于■簡化撥★週轉金的辦法，棉商方面雖說收購棉花絕有把握，但至本月十目止，收購總數不過三萬担，與原定收購一百萬担的目標相差尙遠。</p>
<p>在　紡織業的處境未見有所改善的今日，政府欲以出讓國營紗廠為手段作為籌措發行準備達到穩定幣値的目的，而民營廠　欲以承購國營　業為手段以達到致當的目的，恐怕很難逃出本文最初引述的美國某遠東問題專家的　斷吧、誠如此，則國營事業之為具有特殊背景並有特殊辦法之豪門資本或外來勢力所染指，亦屬自然之事，我人不妨拭目以待事實的說明。</p>

<p>鎢砂之儲運產銷</p>
<p>溯自第一次世界大戰時，製造重武器急需各種稀有金屬，尤以鎢砂最為迫切，而發現我國鋦鑛蘊藏量最為豐富，據專家估計約佔全世界總蘊藏量百分之七十，共有四，一七〇，二五五公噸。分佈於下列各省：</p>
<p>江西　四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公噸</p>
<p>南部　四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公噸</p>
<p>湖南　二一，四〇〇公噸</p>
<p>廣東　一四八，八五五公噸</p>
<p>總計　四，一七〇，二五五公噸</p>
<p>最近在綏遠及遼寗亦有含經鋦百分之四·六之鎢砂發現。雲南廣西僅佔少量，惟確實蘊藏幾何，仍未得知。我國自西南迄東北，均產鎢砂，而以江西為最著名</p>
<p>江西之鎢礦分佈在贛南的會昌，大庾，安遠，贛縣，南康，龍甫，泰和，興國，上猶，雩都一帶。最近以出橘子著名的南豐縣，又發現新鎢礦，不但鎢質極佳，且估計其蘊藏量將佔江西全省之半。</p>
<p>現今全世界所用之鈻量，其中百分之四十由我國供應，所以為重要出口商品之一，亦為歷年來向美國借款之主要保證品之一。</p>
<p>自民國廿一年起，開始由政府主持開採，十五年來之生產量，以民廿八為最多。</p>
<p>我國於民國廿七年，在江西吉安神崗山一度建立煉鎢廠，擬加以提煉，旋為日人所毀，迄今仍以礦砂原料形態輸出，大部由贛南經粵漢路抵達香港，再由香港轉運出口。走私亦多。但自本年一月五日起，中港緝私協定簽訂後，我國八種主要出口商品，須有我國之出口證明文件，才准由香港轉運出口，鎢砂亦為其中之一。簽訂協定日起，以迄上月底止，共有二三，〇五六擔鎢砂自港輸出，現時在香港鎢價每擔約在港幣三百元左右，計値港幣七百萬元云。</p>

<h3 id="c124">中國植物學上奇蹟的發現 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 胡曉肇</p>
<p>研究植物分類學的人，總希望發現新植物，不過自林奈（Linnaeus）分類以來，近二百年，許多植物允其是高等植物大都被研究過，已經有了學名。經騐豐富的分類專家，對於新種往往尙有發現，新屬那就不容易了，至於新科更不必談了。我國地大物博，植物繁茂，種屬至多，又因科學研究發達遲緩，植物分類學在我國仍極重要，具有極大之發現希望。三十年來，在胡先　錢祟澍陳煥鏞諸專家倡導之下，發現很多的新種新屬，我國幅員遼關採集工作尙未完成，前途發現未可限量。</p>
<p>世界上壽命量長，體積最大的植物，要算美國加州的桸楏樹（Sequoia　gigantia）了。據說有幾千年的歷史，樹幹空處可過汽車，其老大可以想見。可是還看更稀奇的植物，現在中國發現了。初聽起來，使您不會相信，不過事實其在，不容疑問，那就是去年二月間南京國立中央大學森林學系鄭萬鈞敎授一行，在四川北交界處所發現的「活化石」—水杉（Metasequoia）。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的，北平靜生生物調查所所長胡先　博士，本其多年來與美國哈佛大學安諾德植物園（Arnold　Arbonum）合作的信譽，去年再度獲得哈佛的補助，即派遺採集隊在川鄂交界地區從事工作，在鄭萬鈞敎授指導之下，由林業改進處王戰君發現了三株這樣的「活化石」水杉。這和一九四一年第一次在美國蒙且那（Mratona）所發現的化石相同，以後又在庫頁島和我國東北發現了。這些化石水杉，生長的時代是和巨大的蜥蜴和恐龍同時的，至少在一萬萬年以前，當時北半球的廣原上，都被這種水杉佈滿了。後來因為氣候陡變，都相繼絕跡，眞想不到在我國西部還有活的水杉的存在，這太使人驚奇了，眞可說是植物學上的一個奇蹟，無疑地是一個劃期性的重大發現，第二次鄭敎授又派了助敎薛紀如君前往調查。又發現了二十五株這樣的樹；第三次採集隊在去年九月出發了，費了三個月的工夫，一共發現了一百多株水杉樹，湖北四川都有全是野生在高約三千呎的斜坡上，現在美國加州大學古生物學系主任簡尼敎授（ProJ．Chaney）特為此事由美來華，親赴巴東調查，並採了許多種子，預備帶回美國播秈，不久世界上各個植物園內，將都有這化石水杉的樹苗了。簡尼敎授會同胡先　所長鄭萬鈞敎授對此新發現的活了幾百萬年的奇蹟植物，加以共同研究，並向我國政府建議，將水杉生長老家闢為國家公園，將由敎育部，中央研究院，靜生生物調查所，中央大學等機關，共同籌辦之，這眞是科舉建設事業的一環。</p>
<p>據初步的研究這水杉不但是一個新種，也是一個新屬，並且可以成立一個新科（科名未定），紫杉科（Taxaceae）和松柏科的許多柏屬植物，都是由這活化石水杉分衍出來的，植物形　學上的對生葉和互生葉葉序學說。將米也要有所改變。樹高約一百呎，針葉美麗，材性頗鬆，生長甚快，宜於造紙。總而言之，這個發現太重大了，太有趣了，想不到湖北四川這個地區，經過了多少西方植物學家採集過，在水杉樹下歇過蔭，都沒有被發現，留待我們中國自己的植物學家來發現，就這一點，也够造成奇蹟了·這無疑的數我國靑年植物學家是一個重大的數勵，値得宣揚的。</p>
<p>美國植物學界名宿，哈佛大學敎授，前任安諾德植物國主任，繆洛博士（Dr．K．D．Merrill）對於這次重大的發現，寄以莫大的興趣，對於我國植物學界的成績，特別稱賀，認為中國是研究植物學的聖地，關於這棵新植物的命名描叙，不敢越俎代庖，仍由中國植物學者自己製成論文發表，因為由誰命名研究，誰就獲得不朽之名了。</p>

<h3 id="c126">電石的製法 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>本刋（二十八期）前會刊拙作「電石」一文，論及電石之性質及其用途，因限於篇幅，未及製造法，茲承讀來函相詢，特書所知，以就正於高明。</p>
<p>電石的製造，在過去只有電爐法（Rlectric　furnace　method）一種，但是由於電石的應用日廣，科學家不斷的研究與改進，在一九三四年出版的「索普氏應用化學字典」（Thorpe’s　Dictionrryh　of　Applied　Chemistry）中，已有直接法（Direct　method)的記載，茲將此兩法分別介紹於下：</p>
<p>電爐法　遠在十九世紀就已發明，它的原料是生石灰與碳（或煤），在電爐中强熱而成，化學反應如下：CaO+3c=caC2十CO</p>
<p>用此法製電石，原料必須十分純粹，絕不能包含磷，硫及鎂等元素，否則少量的磷酸鈣存在於石灰中，會使產品含有磷化鈣雜質，遇水即產生磷化氫的奇臭；少址的硫，也會產生似「皮蛋」臭味的硫化氫;而極微量的鎂素更會影響電石的產量，消耗大量的電能，即使加入螢石鑛來抵抗這一連串的反應，亦鮮成效。至於煤中所含的水份，及石灰中的氫氧化物，均須完全消除，否則生產數額將有顯著的减少，所以普通工業上製造電石，所用的煤必定先在轉動乾燥器（Rotary　dryer）中低溫加熱；又如原料用石灰石CaCO3，必須先經高溫處理，驅除二氧化碳後方能應用。（備料部所需熱量，可利用製電石時所生之熱一氧化碳氣體。）</p>
<p>為了使作用迅速平均起見，原料可先　成細粒，然後按方程式計算比例重量，秤出混和，大約一百份重之石灰與六十五份重之碳即可（按：Kingzett化學百科全書所載為一百份生石灰與七十份無烟煤，如生石灰用量為一噸，即能產生一噸電石；又Riegel工業化學所載為六成石灰與四成焦炭。）根據實際工作的結果，四噸的原料始能產生一噸的電石。</p>
<p>至於電爐的種類大致可分為間斷式（Intgermittent）與連續式（Continuous）兩種，早期所設計的電爐，電石的凝結是在爐中底層的鐵製坩鍋中，這種就是所謂鑄塊爐（Ingot　furnrce），電路的構成由底層之碳與鐵　作為一端，坩鋼中乘直懸掛的碳棒作為另一端，當開始通入電流時，兩端發生電弧，於是將預先製備之原料混合物傾入，原料間即開始反應，　產生一個電石潭，且其濃度也漸增加，直至整個爐內充滿液體電石為止（按：原文對慷燒程度之說明極含糊）；根據Riegel氏之工業化學所載，電　設計在上部有流出孔（Tap　hole），使熔化之電石可隨時流出，因此，此種煉燒爐之容積必須極大，而以耐火磚砌成。液體電石遂使其流入冷却　，使其凝結成塊，由此法製成之電石，純粹度僅百分之八十三，百分之十四為未作用石灰，百分之一為未作用碳，而百分之二為其他維質。</p>
<p>至於電爐煉燒之溫度大概在攝氏二千度至三千度之間，自科學及經濟學的立塲上看來，舍電力而外，並無其他火力可用。</p>
<p>直接法此法係直接由金屬鈣與煤於鐵坩鍋中，在一氫氣壓（Argon　atmosphere）下加熱至攝氏一二二五〇度而成，此反應在金屬鈣的融點—攝氏八一〇度以下，並無顯著的作用，不過，此法製電石，可純至93％，但仍不免有鐵質的黑色。</p>

<h3 id="c128">當心電擊！ <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 友仃</p>
<p>須知，電擊也沒有什麽値得奇怪的，當人體變成了電路的一部份時，正如你扭動開關而即見燈光一樣，其結果是可想而知的。電擊的可怕與否，電壓只是其中因素之一，其他還有電流的性質（交流還是直流；如為交流，其周率又如何），怎樣通過人體，身體的情形，皮膚電阻，電流的大小及作用的時間等等。</p>
<p>嚴格言之，殺人的只是電流，至於電壓只有在電壓高而送入巨大電流時，才居為主要。有時十分小的電流也可致人死命。據一位名呌AlfredW．Barber的檢綫工程研究後報吿稱：周率數為六十，而電壓為一一五伏特的交流電零點零七五安培（七十五個千分之一安），可視為安全與危險的分界綫。但也有人低估為五十僩千分之一安的。如果作用的時間太長，情形又當兩樣，只要八個千分之一安的電流，即可使人極其不適。</p>
<p>最危險的是五十至一五〇周率的交琉電；直流電則多半比交流電的危險性要小些。人體所能忍受的交流電的大小，隨其周率數的昇高而增加，如屬百萬局率的交流電，人體可受三）千個千分之一安而安全無事。</p>
<p>所幸的是人體並不是一種很好的良導體，如以人的左右手接觸電源，則人體可視作是三部不同電阻的串聯。人體內部的電阻是人，其値較低小，約在一千歐與五千歐之間。再老就是人體與電源相接處的皮膚電阻R，其値的變化很大，視情形之不同而異，例如用乾燥的左手在接頭上輕拂而過，則皮膚軍阻可高至二十五萬歐姆；但反之若用右手緊握潮濕的插口，則皮膚電阻可降至二千五百歐姆。</p>
<p>使我們能與電相處的是皮膚電阻，當然我們應該好好保持它，因為沒有了它幾乎也就是沒有了我們。影響電阻的有潮濕，壓力，接觸面積，及電流的作用時間，其中尤以潮濕一項，最為重要。天氣的乾燥與陰濕，往往是電擊危險與否的主因，而微微發汗的手也會使皮膚電阻大形减低。另外在電流正在作用的時候，電阻有失去效力的趨勢，所以電流作用的時間太長也就更加危險。</p>
<h3 id="c129">科學上的偶然發見 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 劉逐生</p>
<p>科學上的發見，往往經歷千辛萬苦，始告成功。例如「鐳」之發見，居利夫人從數噸瀝靑鈾礦中，經過多次的提煉，始獲得些微的「鐳鹽」，更歷艱辛，始得發見金屬之鐳；然亦有適逢偶然之機會，新奇發見，俯拾即是，用舉數例，以見一斑：</p>
<p>1．硬橡皮的發見</p>
<p>「生橡膠」質軟有彈性，不適於用；但若加硫製成「硬橡皮」，頗合製造鈕扣·筆桿·電器等應用。按橡皮加硫法的發見，事出偶然：緣有美人固特異（C．Goodyear），某日正在廚房中工作時，無意間將橡膠與硫的混合物，落於着火的火爐上，發見黏軟的生橡膠，忽變堅硬，而成耐用橡皮。</p>
<p>2．人造染料的發見</p>
<p>十九世紀中葉以前，所有染料，大都來自植物質的藍草與茜紫，但自一八五六年英國柏琴（W．H．Perkin）發見「人造染料」（亦名「煤焦油染料」）以來，迄今已逾數千種，五光十色，備極艷麗！靑年男女，身被美服，理應感謝這位年僅十八在愛好化學實驗中的偶然發見：某晚，柏氏於研究人造金鷄納霜之際，宣吿失敗，感覺疲憊之下，將所用的藥液，全傾於玻璃瓶中，一剎那間，發見一種美麗的顏色，瓶底殘存黑色沉澱。柏氏靈心慧眼，立刻認為听用的「苯胺」（又名「生色精」），可以製出染料，於是着手研究，就造成「苯胺紫」（Mauve），係一種紫色染料。由此發軔，遂衍成今日染料製造學的隆　！</p>
<p>3．電流的發見</p>
<p>——在電學昌明的今日，電流的應用，是非常廣泛而重要！然考共發見的經過，至覺有趣：緣有意大利醫生賈法尼（L．Galvani），因其夫人患病而殺蚌。夫人偶然將刀尖觸及新死蛙腿上的神經，蛙腿忽然起了激烈的痙變，由此動機，賈氏做了許多實驗，以研究此種奇特現象，而名之日「動物電」，其實即是「電流」的最初發見。後經弗打（A．Volta）刻苦研究，電池因得發明。</p>
<p>4．氣的發見</p>
<p>——燃燒，呼吸須臾不可或缺的氧，直至一七七四年八月一日，始被英人普利斯特利（J．Priestley）所發見。普氏曾獲得一直徑十二吋的大透鏡，將日光聚集於「氧化汞」（俗名「三仙丹」）上，則發見有氣體發生，置燭火於此氣體中，即大放光明，使普氏感覺驚異，此即「氧」的發見經過也。不特史家認為普氏事先沒有什麽周密的計畫，即普氏本人，亦自承其氧的發見，大槪出於偶然的機遇、</p>
<p>5．膠的發見</p>
<p>——一硝化甘油」在處理和遝輸上，動輒爆炸，發生災患。自瑞典諾貝爾（A．Nobel）發見用「矽藻土」吸收硝化甘油而成「猛炸藥」(Dynamite）後，其安定性大增，惟未臻完善。諾氏正在　求代替品時，適逢偶然的遭遇：某日，諾氏割破手指，乃取「膠棉」（Collodion）塗抹傷口，以成人造保護皮質．將剩餘的膠棉，傾入硝化甘油中，乃成漿狀物質。由斯遂發見「炸膠」（basting　gelatine），其安定性激增。舉世聞名的諾貝爾獎金，因以產生。</p>
<p>6．人造　靛過程中的重重發見</p>
<p>——製造「藍　」，應取「駢苯」（Naphthalene）俗名「焦油腦」加濃熱硫酸，使成「苯二甲酸」（Phth　alic　acid），惟反應遲緩；幸遇無意的發見：緣在其過程中，時用寒暑表測其溫度，偶一不愼，管破而水銀流出，立刻發覺生成「苯二甲酸」的速度大增，從此即知用水銀為催化劑，藍靛遂得大量製造。</p>
<p>7．憐的發見</p>
<p>——德國煉金家柏蘭德（Brandt）嘗埋頭實　，希求變銀為金之「哲人石」（philosopher；s）Stone時，混砂於尿渣中，加熱偶然獲得「黃憐」</p>
<p>8．溴元素發見的趣史——德人利比喜（J．V．Liebig）於偶然的機會，製得一種液體，性質大致與「氣化碘」相似，不加思索，即貼氯化碘（Iodine　Chloride，ICI）標簽於瓶上。未幾，聞法人巴拉（A．J．Balard）發見新元素」溴」，適與其朝夕不離的所謂氧化碘純然相同，懊傷之餘，祗得自承「先入為主」的觀念，致使重大的發見，失之交臂！</p>
<p>科學上偶然的發見，史實繁多，不可蟬記。如遇機會，應把握機會，繼續努力；若謂良機可期，無異守株待兔，會同樣的感到失望！</p>

<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>我們這個世界自有生物以來，就是一部血淋淋的歷史，達爾文的天演論明白證明，一切生物的歷史都是在競爭中進行的，弱肉強食幾乎是一切生物的眞理，鳥獸昆虫與人類固無待言，就是在植物世界中，也不能超脫道個定理，祇是植物的生存競爭比較隱蔽，不大容易引起人的注意罷了。</p>
<p>相信生存競爭說的人，大槪對於上帝以仁慈之心創造批界這一套宗敎理論是不會相信的，因為一要是當眞有這麽一位上帝，他一定是一個殘忍無比的暴君，因為要是他尙有幾分慈悲心的話，一定不會讓這個世界有了螳螂復有黃雀，有了耗子復有貓……那個為古今詩人所讀美的自然世界，實在是一個錦繡披裝的魔窟。</p>
<p>不過創世紀的那一套，原祗是人類自己所虛構的幻想罷了。自然世界原無所謂慈悲與殘酷或美麗與醜惡，因為自然世界旣無理想，即無所好惡。除人類以外的一切生物動物，都是屬於自然世界的。弱肉强食的生存鐵律，亦祗有在自然世界中才是眞理。</p>
<p>人類在其原始生存階段，確也曾在這種鐵律下生存過一個時期，因為當時人類征服自然的手段尙不高明，祗有在自然律則的生存競爭下討生活。那怕是原始部落間的戰爭，雖然已經含有社會原因，但主要的原因仍在謀直接的生存競爭，絕少是為政治原因發生的。當時旣無所謂戰爭阪子，也沒有甚麼冷戰，熱戰，神經戰或宜傳煽動等純屬於人為的行為。那時的戰爭並不掩飾其掠奪的性格，亦非起於人為的仇恨心，更無所謂主義或正義之類的標榜，祗是為的我想奪你的草原，你要奪我的水源，大家為爭取生存而拼命罷了。</p>
<p>可是人類愈文明，對自然征服的手段愈進步，而人與人間的仇恨與鬥爭，亦愈凶恨殘酷。在過去四十年的短時期中，就曾發生過兩次大規模的大屠殺，而今第三次更可怕的屠殺似乎又已迫臨眼前。這究竟是為了甚麽，是為了生存競爭嗎？是天演論的不可避免的命運嗎？</p>
<p>誰都知道自第一次世界大戰到現在為止的各國一切大小戰爭，與人類的直接生存要求是毫無關係的。因為自科學昌明以來，人類早知其生存競爭的對象該是自然世界而非人間社會的本身。人類征服自然勝利一步，就是對於自已的生存多一分保證。捨此以外即別無生存競爭之道。至於人間社會的自相殘殺，不僅與生存競爭無關，而且實實在在是一種自殺行為。</p>
<p>據我看，由猜疑妬忌所釀成的仇恨心，是現代一切戰爭的主要原因。所謂帝國主義戰爭或階級戰爭云云，就戰學的經濟性格言，雖有其一部原因，不過要不是由於猜忌與妬忌的仇恨心所觸發，照人類現有的生產能力與理智力言，這種戰爭是可能避免的。譬如像階級仇恨，全然是人為的仇恨，鬥爭與殘殺並不能決這個問題，且反足加深人與人間的仇恨鴻溝，甚至毀滅人的天良與善心。</p>
<p>要消滅人與人間的仇恨，應當先讓理智去駕馭意氣，並終止一切足為助長仇恨的宣傳，則世上任何大問題都無不可和平解決之理。但可悲的是現在常常看見一輩手中並不操刀之十，却偏喜喊殺連天，以煽動人間的仇恨為快。此種人雖亦自稱反希特新勒主養反法西斯主義者，然而在鼓勵戰事與挑撥仇恨的一點上，却實在是希特勒主義的後裔。</p>
<p>在好戰者放下屠刀之前，希望這輩也是血肉之驅的人們能先多多放出一些理智來。血腥氣的言論與仇恨的咀咒雖能逞一時之快，然終究有失忠怒之道：更何况有害於人類的世界和平。自然旣賦吾以寳貴的生命，何必不求生存的正道而偏欲煽動莫須有的仇恨呢？</p>
<h3 id="c131">打與騙 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>不知怎的，我對於幼時候非常痛惡的人，現在却覺得他們並不最討厭，並且有的還對之生了好感。</p>
<p>例如家裏一個僕人阿富，一個粗魯粗暴的漢子，我親眼看見他用扁担痛打他的妻子，一個柔良的女人。他吃酒，甚至酗酒，但不許他的女人看一看打牌，不然的話，就是扁祖，拳頭，洗衣服的木杵。我記得當時我小小的心靈中最怕見他的眼睛，那由於多喝了酒而佈滿血絲的眼睛；還有一雙靑筋突露的拳頭，一言不合，便是「老子揍你」！</p>
<p>然而離家十餘年長成了的我，聽到從鄉間傳來阿富死了的消息，却使我發生許多悲傷，覺得這樣一個人如此不幸的死去（他是流浪貧病而死的），幾乎是世界上一件損失。在我現在的腦子裏，阿富已經不再是一個兇殘蠻橫的漢子，而使我最感到深痛而惡絕的，却是一個不常說話的和藹而陰柔的帳房先生，雖然他留在我幼年時代中的影象不深，但我曾經聽說過他騙他遠在異鄉的母親說自己正失業而不匯錢云。</p>
<p>打　子是不該的，但比騙母親要好多了，那倒不是孝不孝的問題，如果騙妻子騙兒子都也是一樣的。與其接到了信以為自己的兒子或丈夫在遙遠的地方找不到職業，在飄泊流浪，因之着急掛念（而事實上他却正預備討親或娶妾），我想倒是寗可嚐嚐扁担拳頭和搗衣棒的滋味的。世界上多的正是哄騙母親的帳房先生，所以阿富無疑地可以算是一個實足的不易多得的好人了。</p>
<p>鴉片烟的禍害不在於它的容易使人上癮，不在於它破壞骨骼和血液的毒質，而在於它的芳香；如果鴉片烟是有着令人作嘔的發臭的氣味們話，我想它的禍害，至多也不過是賣給要自殺的人作為自殺的工具吧了。</p>

<p>不知是不是受了相面之說的影響或暗示，許多人每從一個人寫的字上看人，據說不但可從書法看出人的福澤—窮通夭壽，簡直可以判定人的人格，心術正不正云。</p>
<p>朋友們一這樣說我便駁他，嚴分宜的書法，雄渾端正，如那一說可以成立，則他是正大光明的人，看到他的字也應該對他肅然起敬。最近看一個册頁，後有賈似道的跋，好一派方正磅磚之氣，簡直找不出一點半閒玩堂蟋蟀的無賴影子。</p>
<p>我曾集合了三種書法，一種是鄭孝胥的隷書，鄭書如散花天女，雖然其美在柔，而珈象莊嚴，並非柔若無骨的，而且看來他的書法胎恩漢隸，軟綫條裏有硬，何嘗不堂堂正正之至！一是李完用所題的字，規矩井然，不但有廟堂氣，而且有兩　冷猪肉氣，差不多可以看出一個正統派的正人君子來。一是汪精衛的信，書法流走而淸疏，書卷氣之外，還彷彿有狂狷氣，如從書看人，不但淡於名利，而且高潔得很。</p>
<p>彼三子者或為認賊作父賣東三省的漢奸（偽滿國務總理鄭孝胥）或為親手斷送朝鮮的賣國賊（韓相李完用後受日封侯），或為中國國家的大販子，從他們三人的字上看，「書法人格論」之無稽，思過半矣。</p>
<p>因此想到為了涇渭分明，為了使每一個漢奸賣國賊想流芳同時也就是遣臭，—昭示於人人知道一個縱然有很大的才情，很高藝術天才的人倘不能愛護他的民族國家使將不齒於人類，也就是一種正氣培養運動，我很想彙集若千古今中國（及其藩屬）賣國賊的書書，開一個國賊書畫展。經我已收集的有袁金鎧（偽滿大臣）的親筆書牘，秦槍的冊頁，梁鴻志黃秋岳王揖堂的詩箋。</p>

<p>嘗思富貴壽考，世罕兼事之人；妻財子祿，難得件件如意。因之有逾而立之年而未娶者，常興「無家可歸」之歎，而已娶者則不免怨有「家室之累」。子女衆多之家，寗願財豐而無子；在資財豐裕而尙乏子嗣者看來，則認為貧者隨時可能暴富，而子女都不能要有即有，故不免渴望子女。</p>
<p>世人大都寗捨近而就遠，貴所聞而賤所見，鄙視現實而愛好虛渺。吾人貴鴣賤雉者，鵠遠雉近也。國人重美鈔而輕法幣，亦無非法幣天天接觸，美鈔為不常見之物耳。響諸往昔淪陷區之偽幣，本來輕之如敝屣者，待准換法幣前之數日，忽又大增其値，此蓋行將自現實之域退入虛無飄渺之境之故也。</p>
<p>實則今之法幣並不如想像的那麼不値錢。據中央肚八日電，全經會委員黃元彬談運用美援稱：「此項經濟援助，每月平均約有二千八百萬美元之物資，照美元時價計算，約値十六萬億法幣，如能全部照市價在市面上發售，最少可値三十萬億元之法幣，連財部每月稅收十萬億元計之，除每月支出外，不出三個月，當可收回法幣全部。」又據蔣主席於九日對國大所作政治報吿中說，法幣發行總額迄三月底止，尙不到七十萬億，而政府所存金銀外匯及變價物資，其總値達七億美元，抵法幣三倍而有餘，而最近美國援華四億餘美元之貸款尙未計算在內。據此二說，我國通貨之膨脹，實未如一般所想像之甚，國人又何必貴美鈔如鵠，而賤法幣如雉乎？</p>

<p>見傷了人，車上的士兵急跳下車一看，見渚齋躺在地上，滿身是血，人已昏迷過去，一時地方警察趕到，勒令卡車先把傷人送到附近春明醫院救治，醫院檢查渚齋腦部受傷很重，一面救治，檢查他身份證，知是銀行職員，又看身上帶有費肖柏的信，急行分別通知。肖柏剛行回家，接到電話，大吃一驚，急忙坐汽車趕到醫院，此時渚齊經醫院救治，連注射幾針强心針，雖醒過來，已奄奄一息。據醫院醫生報吿，腦部震傷極重，非常危險，怕不易挽救，肖柏急到病室，見渚齋躺在床上，手足和頭面，都用綳布包裹着，見肖柏進來，睜着微弱眼光，說道：「姑丈，你來太好了。我的精神，似乎把持不住，我有幾句話要吿訴你，我的傷不會鄧的，這不幸消息，不要給父親知道，將來更不要給綺紈知道，我很對不住他們，很對不住……」說到這裏，那聲音更微弱了，只見他嘴唇顫動，已發不出聲音來。旁邊站的看護婦說道：「剛才是注射强心針支持的，假如還有話說，可以再注射一針。」肖柏看了，心上非常難過，搖搖頭道：「他家屬還不知道呢，等我通知他們。」說着，見渚齋眼睛已闔，肖柏掩面，　着眼淚走出去，急開了毓如和鳳笙的住址，專人分頭送信，約莫半個鐘頭，毓如夫婦來時，已趕不上，渚齊業已氣絕，毓如夫婦大哭一塲，肖柏把早上遇見渚齊情形，以及剛才渚齋臨終託付，說了一遍，毓如流淚道：「他說對不住我，實在我很對不住他。當日若不是我一點私意和偏見，到綺紈家裏，訴說苦衷，綺紈不會中道和渚齋斷絕交誼，他二人不會離開，今天或者不至有這塲慘劇。為我一人私見，累得綺紈受許多磨折，遠走高飛，渚齋結果，仍是一死，我很痛心很後悔的！看綺紈來信，她是個至情人，若把渚齋死訊吿訴她，她一定傷心之極，我不能再摧殘她，我要照渚齊的話，永遠瞞她，不叫她知道，好呌她在海上，多逍遙一些歲月。」肖柏聽了，默言無語，覺得毓如這話，似有理又似無理，無從判斷。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The election of the first President of the Republic of China will be held at 9:00 AM on the 19th during the 13th session of the National Assembly. All of the more than 2,700 representatives who have registered will solemnly cast their sacred ballots to write this historical event into the history of democratic constitutionalism. After the voting is completed in the morning, the ballots will be counted immediately to tabulate the election results. The election of the President is the most important task of this session of the National Assembly. Therefore, the Secretariat of the Assembly has prepared extremely carefully for this matter. All procedures related to the election process, such as voting and ballot counting, have been established in accordance with the Presidential Election and Recall Law. At the same time, the practical arrangements have also been completed to ensure that the objectives of speed and accuracy are achieved. In accordance with the regulations, six separated ballot-writing areas and twelve ballot boxes have been set up in the venue, all arranged and numbered in sequence. Supervisors will be appointed for the voting and ballot counting processes. The selection of these individuals will be based on the principle of one person per unit by the Presidium. The voting supervisors will be divided into four groups, with the following distribution of responsibilities: The first group will receive the ballots from the Presidium before voting, verify the number, and supervise the distribution of ballots by the ballot distributors. After the voting is completed, they will check the number of ballots issued and the number of unused ballots, and report to the Presidium. The second group, one person per ballot box, will publicly open and inspect the ballot boxes before the start of voting and seal them. After the voting is completed, they will add another seal. The third group will maintain order during voting and supervise whether there are any omissions or illegal activities in the voting process. The fourth group will patrol and supervise outside the venue to maintain order. Secondly, during voting, representatives will go to the ballot distribution point in order, present their representative credentials to receive ballots, and have their credentials stamped. They will then go to the ballot-writing area to select one candidate using a secret ballot method and personally place the ballot into the ballot box. Representatives will leave the venue after voting and re-enter the venue when the ballots are counted. The ballot counting supervisors will be divided into six groups to separately perform duties such as verifying whether there are any invalid ballots in the ballot boxes and checking the number of ballots. These regulations are extremely detailed and have been passed by the Presidium after obtaining consent at the twelfth session of the Assembly on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its 22nd meeting on the evening of the 18th, chaired by Bai Yunti. It was resolved that a general assembly would be held on the 19th, with the election of the President in the morning, chaired by Zhou Zhongyue. In the afternoon, the heads of government will provide answers to the review of various reports, chaired by Feng Youzhen. During the Presidium meeting, representatives Wang Yunwu, Shui Zi, and Zhang Xiwen were also selected to draw lots for the voting and ballot counting supervisors.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, explained the main points of the presidential and vice-presidential voting and ballot counting methods at the 12th session of the National Assembly on the 18th: (1) Secret ballot writing, i.e., separate ballot counting. (2) The voting and ballot writing locations are both inside the assembly hall. (3) Save time. (4) Accuracy. (5) Supervision of voting and ballot counting is to be carried out by one person from each unit, using a lottery method. Subsequently, representatives raised opinions, which were answered by Hong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The National Assembly has scheduled the presidential election for the morning of the 19th. The Central Broadcasting Station (call sign XGOA) will hold a special broadcast program inside the assembly hall, broadcasting live continuously from 9:30 AM onwards. At the same time, it will be broadcast jointly by three stations on mediumwave 454.66 meters, 660 kilocycles, shortwave 30.8 meters, 9730 kilocycles, and shortwave 25.35 meters, 11835 kilocycles. At that time, compatriots across the country and people around the world can listen to the various dynamics of the National Assembly venue, the evolution and increase of the ballot counting numbers, detailed information, and the election results.</p>
<h3 id="e2">To Cope with National Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion: Temporary Clauses Added to the Constitution; National Assembly Completes Second and Third Readings <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The 12th session of the National Assembly was held at 9:30 AM on the 18th. The amendment to the Constitution completed the second and third reading procedures at the meeting and was passed, completing the first major task of the constitutional National Assembly. The Assembly was chaired by Yu Bin from the eighth group of the Presidium. 2,045 representatives were present, exceeding the statutory two-thirds of the total number. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the Secretariat reported two matters: A, reading the minutes of the eleventh session of the Assembly, and B, the Presidium reporting the proposed voting and ballot counting methods for the President and Vice President. At 10:10 AM, the discussion of the constitutional amendment began, and the Secretariat read the review report of the first group's review committee. Subsequently, Zhang Yingshu and Luo Wenmo, conveners of the first group's review committee, explained the details of the review committee, and Wang Shijie, representing the Presidium, explained the procedure for amending the Constitution, outlining several points: (1) The temporary clauses have a limited duration and do not require constitutional amendment, and are relatively more convenient. It is hoped that the Assembly can pass them in accordance with the constitutional amendment procedure. (2) There are precedents in various countries. (3) They are subject to the control of the National Assembly, protecting civil rights. (4) The original intention of the clauses was to cope with the needs of suppressing the rebellion, and anyone who can lead the suppression of the rebellion should be trusted. Subsequently, Tian Zhiping, Jia Yongxiang, and others spoke. Tian Zhiping believed that the National Assembly must have a spirit of abiding by the law and democracy, but the chairman did not allow him to speak during the review committee, and this review report was not a summary of everyone's opinions. Moreover, the temporary clauses were proposed by 771 people, so how can the amendment opinions proposed by a minority of people change the proposal of the majority? Jia Yongxiang also stated that he did not have the opportunity to speak during the review committee, believing that the chairman of the review committee was undemocratic. Pan Gongzhan then discussed the case, proposing two textual amendments. That is, the constitutional amendment proposal of this session of the National Assembly has not yet been submitted for discussion, but is still under review. Therefore, the textual part of the temporary clauses should be clearly pointed out, on the one hand, to give this session a clear explanation, and at the same time, to explain that the constitutional amendment proposal will be discussed at the next session. Finally, he explained that he agreed with amendment one in the review report. After a 15-minute break, the Assembly resumed. Liu and others spoke in succession. Liu agreed with this amendment, specifically emphasizing the importance of suppressing the rebellion. At 11:30 AM, the chairman declared that both positive and negative opinions had been expressed, and immediately began the second reading. The Secretary-General read each clause one by one. Those without objection were passed. A small number of people raised opinions. At 12:05 PM, a vote was taken. Of the 2,045 people present, 1,708 voted in favor, exceeding three-quarters. The second reading was passed. The third reading continued, and the entire case was put to a vote. Of the 2,045 people present, 1,624 voted in favor. The entire case was passed without any amendments according to the original proposal (the full text of the review report can be found on the first page of today's newspaper). The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting at 12:07 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Wang Chonghui's Remarks: Constitutional Amendment Adding Rebellion Suppression Clauses Sufficient to Ensure Social Tranquility <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After the National Assembly passed the "Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion" constitutional amendment on the afternoon of the 18th, Dr. Wang Chonghui, an authority on law, gave an exclusive interview to reporters from this newspaper: "Our country's constitution provides thorough protection of the people's rights, comparable to any advanced constitutional country. The President and the executive power are subject to the constraints of the Legislative Yuan, which is particularly progressive. However, whether these democratic systems can effectively guarantee national security and the people's interests, or quickly respond to major economic and financial changes during the rebellion suppression period, is uncertain. According to general national practice, in such a serious period, it is necessary for the popular will to grant the government authorities emergency disposition powers. The passage of the temporary provisions allows the President to facilitate the exercise of his powers in accordance with the permission of the Constitution, without being subject to the procedures of the Legislative Yuan at any time, so that the military suppression of the rebellion can proceed smoothly, social order is ensured, and the whole people can reach the seat of well-being as soon as possible. He also emphasized that the status of this clause is the same as the Constitution itself, and only the National Assembly can make the decision to amend or repeal it. The Legislative Yuan can only formulate amendments in accordance with the procedures of Article 174, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, and submit them to the National Assembly for reconsideration.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Northeastern National Assembly Representatives Call on the Chairman <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Present Views on Politics, Economics, and Education</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Twenty-two Northeastern National Assembly representatives and others called on Chairman Chiang at 4:30 PM on the 18th, requesting the dispatch of more troops to reinforce the Northeast and save the critical situation, and put forward four requests: (1) Dispatch more troops to launch an offensive. In addition to ensuring major strongholds with a portion of the troops, a portion of the troops should also be mobilized to attack and ensure the two seaports of Yingkou and Huludao. (2) Innovate politics and abolish the Political Committee of the Northeast Headquarters. (3) Improve the economy. The Northeastern circulating coupons should be stopped immediately. Before they are recovered on a regular basis, they can be circulated in Guannei without restriction. All military food should be transported by the central government, and the distribution of grain should be expanded to the three cities of Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou. Quickly transport a large amount of grain to the Northeast to alleviate the grain shortage. (4) Rescue the youth of the Northeast.

He used the voting machine three times during the meeting. The first time the chairman used it, he looked around for where the button was, not knowing where it was located.

Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is the Director-General of the Kuomintang, and there are already several Kuomintang members running for Vice President.

<h3 id="e8">Anhui Students Petition: Demand Government Replace Li Pinxian; Clashes with Police on Way to National Assembly Hall <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] More than 100 Anhui students from universities and middle schools in Nanjing, Shanghai, Anqing, and other places went to the National Assembly again at around 10:00 AM on the 18th to petition for the government to replace Li Pinxian, the chairman of the province. The police stopped them near the Paifang, but the students formed a team and rushed forward. At 10:40 AM, the police tried to stop the students from advancing, leading to a clash between the two sides. Xu Shaojiu, a student from Chengchi University, and Qian Yetong, a student from Central University, and others suffered minor head injuries in the chaos. At that time, the Presidium of the National Assembly had appointed Wu Zhongxin, Xue Mabi, and Hu Jingan to talk to the students. Wu told the students that he would ask the Assembly to recommend the government, but the National Assembly had no power to deal with this matter. Since everyone had expressed this, they could go back. The students insisted on waiting for a solution and knelt down on the street. Wu Zhongxin also knelt down facing the students for 20 minutes. The students asked Wu to stand up, and Wu ordered the students to stand up as well. At that time, the students were still agitated and demanded that they be allowed to shout slogans in front of the Assembly gate before they would disperse. After repeated dissuasion by Wu, Xue, Hu, and others, the students finally appointed ten representatives to the Presidium representatives to explain their views in detail. Wu and others promised to ask the Presidium of the Assembly to report the situation of the Anhui students' petition at the Assembly on the 19th. The Anhui representatives also jointly submitted a proposal to the Assembly, asking the government to replace Li Pinxian and give the students a reply within three days. The students left together at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 18th] Li Pinxian replied to the three suggestions of the Anhui National Assembly representatives: (1) The Communists have already fled west. The remaining scattered bandits are now being ordered by the Security Headquarters and the Pacification Zone Headquarters to eliminate them within a time limit in order to maintain local tranquility. (2) Once the central security funds are issued, the self-defense special donation will be stopped. (3) The selection of county magistrates has always been based on the principle of appointing capable people from Anhui. In the future, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Personnel Office will pay more attention.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The issue of signing National Assembly representatives was resolved on the afternoon of the 18th. The solution is: the government will issue election certificates to signing representatives who received many votes but did not attend the Assembly, but they will no longer attend the Assembly. At 4:00 PM, Yu Bin, Mo Dehui, and others called on the Chairman, proposing six solutions and requesting approval. The Chairman agreed in principle, but said that the eight representatives must resume eating first, and then the implementation would be approved. Yu and others immediately left and went to the Fifth Reception Center with Ma Wanche and Sheng Zizhuang to persuade the eight representatives to resume eating, and told them the solution. The fasting representatives immediately expressed their acceptance. At 8:00 PM, representatives Yan Zezi and Zhang Fu and others began to eat thin porridge. Wang Yunwu immediately used the phone to report to the Chairman, and the Chairman was also gratified to hear this. The eight representatives also issued a statement resuming eating, to thank everyone for their concern and love. After hearing the above news, Shanghai Speaker Pan Gongyan said: The eight representatives have been weakened by more than ten days of fasting.

<h3 id="e14">National Assembly Chronicle: Grasping the Key Points to Complete the Constitutional Amendment <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] From the eve of the opening of this National Assembly to the adjournment of the First Review Committee on the 17th, the main trend among the representatives was constitutional amendment. When discussing the rules of procedure, when discussing the assembly schedule, the representatives fought for the opportunity to amend the Constitution, the representatives asked to advance the discussion time of the constitutional amendment, and even one representative shouted: "We must discuss the constitutional amendment first, then the election, otherwise, after the election is completed, the representatives will disperse, and the number of people to amend the Constitution will be insufficient!" The boos, shouts, disputes, and chaos in the first reading and the two-day review committee had the same purpose: to amend the Constitution. Some representatives held the opposite view, opposing the amendment. Of the six legal proposals submitted, four were minor local issues. Only the proposals of Zhang Zhiben and Mo Dehui were important amendments. Zhang Zhiben advocated increasing the National Assembly's powers of initiation and referendum and that the National Assembly be convened once every two years. Mo Dehui advocated adding temporary clauses for the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, giving the President great emergency powers. The review committee used two days and four chaotic disputes to exchange for a comprehensive review report, grasping the key points, accommodating the spirit and substance of the two proposals, formulating four temporary clauses for the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, and submitting them to the 12th Assembly on the morning of the 18th. Chairman Chiang first sat on the presidium platform as the chairman of the National Government, and later sat in the representative seat as a representative of the people. He led the silence and order of the whole venue, making the second and third readings pass smoothly in one morning's meeting, completing the procedure of constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>The disputes caused by the constitutional amendment were most severe on the 16th. In the morning, Wang Peiji's "big representatives, small representatives, big representatives represent small representatives signing," and in the afternoon, Tang Zhixian's "blind obedience" caused two uproars. Chairman Chiang's "contributed" opinions to the representatives in the capacity of "one of the people" took effect. Although some people at the review committee finally proposed "talk about it tomorrow," no one insisted on "talking about it again" on the morning of the 18th, nor did anyone support "talking about it again." Yu Bin chaired the 12th Assembly. Among the presidium members, Yu Bin was better at controlling the venue. The Chairman of the National Government was also sitting on the presidium platform while this powerful and loud chairman performed his duties, which made him unexpectedly successful. The report and discussion on the voting and ballot counting methods for the President and Vice President did not cause any disturbances. The people on the platform accommodated the opinions of the people below, that the attendance certificate should not be stamped with a dou stamp. The explanations of Zhang Yingshu and Luo Wenmo, the conveners of the First Review Committee, and Wang Shijie and Wang Chonghui of the Presidium helped the smooth progress of the discussion. When widely expressing opinions, Tian Zhiping again questioned: (1) Why was the draft review report printed in advance? (2) Why did the review report overturn Zhang Zhiben's proposal? (3) The cancellation of constitutional amendments should be decided by the Assembly. Why was it decided by the 263-member review committee? Jia Yongxiang said: "I advocate amendment, but I accept the intentions of President Chiang and will not submit it again." He loudly accused Lin Bin, the chairman of yesterday's review committee, of violating the law and depriving the representatives of their right to speak. When they spoke, some people applauded and some people booed. Pan Gongzhan's specific amendment opinions won the most applause. After the break, Tang Zhixian, Liu Shougang, Liu Jiashu, and Li Zhonglin spoke, but they did not attract much attention.</p>
<p>In order to complete at least the second reading procedure in the morning, Yu Bin decisively announced the cessation of discussion with the voting machine at 11:30 AM, and proceeded with the second reading clause by clause and resolution with the approval of 1,729 of the 2,045 people present. Hong Lanyou was ordered to read the clauses. The first clause was calm and smooth, and it was passed smoothly. The second clause was interrupted by Li Hongru, Zhang Jiading, and others, but Yu Bin put their opinions on deleting the second clause to a vote, and only 214 people approved, so it could not be established. The third and fourth clauses were also smooth, and the amendment to the fourth clause could not be established according to law. So Yu Bin used the voting machine again and passed the second reading with the consent of 1,728 people. Some representatives thought that the meeting was about to adjourn and stood up one after another, but Yu Bin declared the third reading without stopping and voted on the proposal as a whole. The colorful voting machines lit up again, and the third reading procedure was passed with the consent of 1,624 people.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the review report was to resolve the constitutional amendment disputes by grasping the key points. In addition to granting the President the power to respond to emergencies, which was unanimously agreed upon, regarding constitutional amendment, it was stipulated in the clauses that it would be discussed at the temporary assembly eight months later. All constitutional amendment proposals were equivalent to being reserved. The only amendment was that the President could not be restricted by the provisions of Articles 39 and 43 of the Constitution during the rebellion suppression period.</p>
<p>The review report was passed at the third reading at 12:07 PM on April 18. The first meeting of the first National Assembly completed the first important task - amending the Constitution. And tomorrow, as Hong Lanyou reported, will be the election of the first President of the Republic of China. (April 18, Nanjing)</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Situation in Hebei Becomes Increasingly Optimistic: National Army Continuously Recovers Yixian and Anxin; Air Force Flies Over and Bombs the Outskirts of Linfen, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Bandits <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 18th] Military News: The war situation in central Hebei is becoming increasingly optimistic. The National Army in Baoding, in coordination with local forces, also began operations yesterday. At 8:00 PM on the 17th, the Eastern Command launched an attack. At midnight, bandit units from Qingyuan, Anxin, and Shangyang engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in Anxin for eight hours, after which they were completely annihilated. This morning at 11:00 AM, the National Army, in one fell swoop, recovered Anxin County, and is expected to join forces with the National Army in Renqiu. Thus, all important strongholds in the Pingjin-Bao triangle area have fallen into the hands of the National Army. Furthermore, the Baoding National Army has also deployed offensive operations towards the south and west of Baoding.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] The North China剿匪 Headquarters announced: In coordination with the operations in central Hebei, the National Army on the Ping-Bao Line also launched an offensive on the 17th. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, Yixian was captured and is currently under attack from three directions. The main force of the National Army in central Hebei is the elite troops of General Chuan’s division and the cavalry of General E You-san’s division. On the morning of the 16th, they advanced eastward from Renqiu, sweeping through the area and seizing over 10,000 tons of grain in Chenzhuang, and destroying a large amount of communication equipment and paper mills. In the past few days, a total of more than 1,400 bandits have been killed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] Our Air Force dispatched planes on the night of the 17th to attack the bandits on the outskirts of Linfen. When they arrived over Linfen, they discovered that the bandits were using fierce artillery fire from the Dongguan Power Plant and Flour Mill to bombard the city. They immediately dropped bombs, and the bandit artillery fire quickly ceased. Based on the instructions from the ground forces' radio station, they dropped bombs on the bandit positions 700 meters south of the city, and on the bandit heavy weapon positions in Guojiazhuang north of the city and Nanbei Lizun, all of which hit their targets, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] The Defense of Linfen has lasted for more than 40 days. As of now, our city walls still stand firm. The bandit army, disregarding the lives of the people, uses "human wave" and "explosive" tactics. Although they have captured most of the outer strongholds, their losses have reached more than 30,000 people. According to military statistics, as of April 10th, more than 29,000 bandits have been killed or wounded, 61 bandits have been captured, and 2 light cannons, 9 light machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, 211 rifles, 1 submachine gun, 1 grenade launcher, 792 hand grenades, 72 boxes of explosives, and a large number of other military supplies such as bullets, helmets, and telephones have been seized.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Editorial: Wishing Chairman Chiang's Election as President <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>After the National Assembly announced the presidential candidates, voting will begin this morning at 9:00 AM, and the votes will be counted solemnly on the spot. It is expected that by noon today, the first president of the Republic of China will be known. This National Assembly's election of the president is not only the completion of its basic task, but also the first step for our country to embark on the path of democratic constitutionalism. All those who wish to see China peaceful, democratic, unified, and strong attach great importance to this presidential election, and even more, hope that our country's only supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, will be the helmsman of the Republic of China, so that this broken ship under stormy waves can safely reach the other shore. Looking at the general trend and observing the situation in all aspects, there is absolutely no problem with Chairman Chiang being elected as the first president. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Chiang on his election as the first president, and to state the great significance of Chairman Chiang's election as president:</p>
<p>First, Chairman Chiang's election as president should not be regarded as a victory for the Kuomintang party alone, but should be regarded as the success of a grand unity of all parties and non-partisans in the country. Chairman Chiang is not only the President of the Kuomintang party, but also the supreme leader of the country. He has firmly stated that he is unwilling to be the presidential candidate of the Kuomintang party, and has never engaged in actual campaigning with the humble demeanor of a great statesman. This is his test of whether the people of the whole country truly support him. However, the people of the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of north or south, have unanimously expressed their warm support. 2,489 National Assembly representatives have quickly signed Chairman Chiang as a presidential candidate, accounting for almost 95% of the total number of National Assembly representatives. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's election as president today is clear evidence that he is a non-partisan national leader.</p>
<p>Second, although our country's constitution stipulates that the president does not bear actual administrative responsibility, after Chairman Chiang is elected as president, he will still be the supreme helmsman guiding the country onto a smooth path. Everyone knows that Chairman Chiang's great achievements in the past 25 years are unique in our country's history. Even Chairman Chiang's tireless efforts day and night cannot be matched by anyone. Since the Northern Expedition, he has overthrown the warlords and completed unification. He then resisted the Japanese aggressors externally, defeated the Japanese invaders, abolished all unequal treaties, and implemented the full purpose of nationalism. After the victory, he actively promoted constitutionalism. If it were not for the scourge of the Communist bandits, the purpose of the National Revolution could have been fully completed. We also wish that the leader who has worked hard and made great contributions can retire after his success. However, in the current situation, there are many difficulties and crises are lurking. Only with Chairman Chiang taking on the arduous task can the current difficulties be overcome. Therefore, due to the actual needs, Chairman Chiang will still be the supreme helmsman of the country after being elected as president.</p>
<p>Third, Chairman Chiang's election as president is the most reliable guarantee for our country's democratic constitutionalism. Chairman Chiang not only possesses the traditional spirit of ancient Chinese sages and sages, he is unwilling to hold high positions without taking responsibility; moreover, he is rich in modern democratic demeanor, able to tolerate criticism from others on the one hand, and respect the opinions of minority parties on the other. When the National Assembly had disputes over the two constitutional drafts the year before last, the Kuomintang party only had Chairman Chiang supporting the constitution drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. This time, the National Assembly caused a great uproar over the issue of constitutional amendments, and Chairman Chiang was the only one in the Kuomintang party who opposed amending the constitution. Therefore, we believe that Chairman Chiang is the first person in the country who is loyal to the constitution and loyal to implementing the constitution. After he is elected as president, he will undoubtedly add a strong guarantee to China's political progress on the path of democratic constitutionalism step by step. Fourth, Chairman Chiang's election as president is the harbinger of political reform in China. We foresee that after the National Assembly closes, the elected Legislative Yuan will follow up with a meeting. The president will propose candidates for the president of the Executive Yuan, and after obtaining the consent of the Legislative Yuan, the government can be organized. In the future, no matter what internal affairs, diplomacy, finance, and gold are adopted, the public opinion will be the basis. Although the president does not bear actual administrative responsibility, the president is still the supreme helmsman guiding the country forward. We believe that the elected government will be able to change the past habits of incompetence and corruption, and be able to make a fresh start with the people.</p>
<p>We are about to see the most glorious and brilliant page in our country's history unfold, and we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Chiang on his election as the first president of the Republic of China!</p>
<h3 id="e17">Italy Begins General Election <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Italy's highly anticipated April general election began voting yesterday. 41,448 polling stations have been set up, all under strict guard by the military and police, allowing ordinary good voters to freely cast their most sacred vote. As of the time of writing, the atmosphere in various parts of Italy is extremely tense, but no serious incidents have occurred. It is expected that this general election will not be disrupted and temporarily suspended. According to the leader of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, Casperi, he believes that the results of this general election will be better than the June general election in 1946. However, the final results will not be revealed until two or three days later at the earliest. All the speculations made by various parties now are inevitably too plain. They cannot be confirmed until the final announcement.</p>
<p>In this general election in Italy, 570 members of the House of Representatives and 237 senators will be elected. The term of office for the members is two years. In other words, the results of this general election will be sufficient to determine Italy's politics in the past two years. In the democratic century, holding general elections in various countries is originally a very common thing and does not require such attention. However, in today's world polarization process, the Italian general election has not only caused fierce competition between the left and right parties in Italy, but also caused the struggle between the two major groups in the international community, shifting the focus of their Cold War to the Italian peninsula.</p>
<p>Looking at the general trend and the situation in all aspects, the results of this general election may allow the Christian Democratic Party to overwhelm the Italian Communist Party and its fellow travelers, and still win the election and continue to be in power for two years. However, the future of the Casperi cabinet is still not optimistic. Because Italy is an island country with a small land and poor people, it relied on overseas colonies before the war, and it could meet its own needs for food and clothing. However, after the war, Italy was destroyed by the war and it was not easy to restore its vitality. Furthermore, all its colonies were deprived of it, and the source of food and clothing materials was interrupted. Therefore, both the country's finances and the people's lives are in extreme difficulty. Under such circumstances, relying solely on foreign aid is not enough to overcome the difficulties. Italy's rebirth still depends on its own strength. The Casperi government has been in power for many years and has no political achievements to speak of, which has greatly disappointed the Italian people. Even if it wins this general election, if it still cannot make full use of US aid as the basis for self-reliance and make Italy's economy revive in the next two years, then the current government will inevitably collapse two years later, and there will be no way to save it.</p>
<h3 id="e18">National Federation of Trade Unions Established; Opening Ceremony Held in Nanjing Yesterday; Gu Zhenggang Reads Chairman's Admonition <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The National Federation of Trade Unions of the Republic of China was officially established at the Xiaguan Workers' Welfare Center at 9:00 AM on the 18th. The opening ceremony was simple and solemn. Liu Songshan, director of the Railway Union, served as chairman. Government leaders and foreign guests who attended the meeting included Vice Chairman of the National Government Sun Ke, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Central Agriculture and Industry Ma Chaojun, labor counselors of British and American embassies, and representatives of the French Catholic Trade Union, totaling more than 150 people. In his opening speech, Liu Songshan congratulated this memorable day in the history of China's labor movement, saying that the establishment of the Federation of Trade Unions not only adds to the glory of the new China of democratic constitutionalism, but also adds a new force to international labor. The characteristic of China's labor movement lies in always cooperating with the national revolution and taking national interests as the premise. In the future, China's labor movement has entered a new stage, and it should also recognize the new responsibilities it should shoulder in the new stage, assisting the country in developing industry and promoting peace. Minister Gu then read the admonition issued by Chairman Chiang, placing infinite expectations on the tasks of the Federation of Trade Unions after its establishment. In his speech, Vice Chairman Sun encouraged the trade union to strive to improve the knowledge level of its members and enhance their skills in order to strive for the status of workers. Minister Gu believes that the development history of Chinese workers is complementary to the history of the Chinese revolution. He hopes that the Federation of Trade Unions will lead the national workers in the future to be the living force for realizing the Three Principles of the People, complete the mission of industrializing China, and make the trade union a general organization for seeking the welfare of workers, moving towards unity and progress.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Taiwan Provincial National Assembly Representatives Association hosted a reception for the press at the Longmen Restaurant at 3:00 PM on the 18th. Wang Minning, Lin Zhongjian, and others attended to report on the current hopes of the Taiwanese people and to refute recent rumors of Taiwan requesting trusteeship or independence. It was stated that since Taiwan's restoration, the people have rapidly absorbed the culture of the motherland. The Japanese enslavement education policies of the past have left no trace in less than three years, truly reflecting the sincere inclination of the Taiwanese people toward the mainland. However, recently, schemers have fabricated rumors; the so-called "trusteeship" and "independence" claims are entirely unfounded. Yesterday's New Asia News Agency Tokyo 16th dispatch carried a report by the Associated Press, claiming that Taiwanese National Assembly representatives were requesting autonomy, which was published in Tokyo newspapers. This type of news is akin to taking excerpts out of context and exaggerating local details. The autonomy we hope for today is based entirely on the provisions of the Constitution and has no special emotional significance whatsoever. The current situation in Taiwan is in complete agreement with the central government's regulations for implementing local self-governance. We sincerely hope that the central government will issue an official order designating Taiwan as a model province for the implementation of local self-governance, thereby implementing local self-governance at an early date. This is the ardent hope of all the people of Taiwan. In other economic matters, exports of Taiwanese products, such as coal and sugar, are purchased by the competent authorities at low prices, while imported materials, such as fertilizers and cotton yarn, must be purchased at high prices. We hope that this situation can be improved.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 18th] After the murder of Deng Meikui in Yiyang Zhengyan Township, Meng Zhaoyun, Chairman of the County Farmers' Association, and Deng's wife, Chen, came to Changsha to protest the injustice. The authorities promised to ensure their safety before they returned to the county. However, Chen Huimin, an instructor from the county government, searched for Deng's wife in the township and ended up severely beating Chairman Meng and Deng's wife Chen. The news has spread, and all parties are deeply indignant. The reporter specially visited Chairman Wang to inquire about his attitude. Mr. Wang said: (1) The Deng case is complex and purely a result of local factions and has nothing to do with the 25% rent reduction. (2) Protecting the interests of tenant farmers is a fixed policy of the central government. If anyone obstructs or undermines it, they will be prosecuted according to the law. (3) He is very concerned about the beating of Meng Zhaoyun and others, and the situation where the heads of the Farmers' Association in Zhengyan Township were forced to flee to other counties. Those who violate the law will be severely punished. Finally, Mr. Wang expressed deep regret for the landlords' obstruction of rent restrictions.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Sixteen U.S. Senators and fourteen Representatives have proposed that the Soviet Union should be disregarded in world plans from now on unless it is prepared to acknowledge the approval of the majority of nations. If this proposal is passed, the current United Nations will undergo major changes, leading to the Soviet Union's actual withdrawal, or the current United Nations will be set aside, and another world organization will be formed, including only anti-communist countries.</p>
<p>The House plan, proposed by seven members each from the Republican and Democratic parties, will be reviewed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in late this month. If passed, it will only be an advisory opinion to the State Department and the President. The Senate plan, proposed by nine Republican and seven Democratic Senators, will also be reviewed by the Foreign Relations Committee and is of a stronger nature. It will ask the President to take action to change the UN regulations. In any case, U.S. congressmen have strongly reacted to the Soviet Union's use of the veto power twenty-three times in the past two years, leading to twenty-eight proposals in the House and three in the Senate regarding amending the UN Charter. The House proposals include the following key points: (1) The veto power should be abolished when taking action against aggressors or voting on new members joining the United Nations; (2) The charter should define aggression as a country or its people using armed force against the recognized territory of a member state, or a country occupying territory beyond its borders; (3) It should stipulate prohibited military equipment, such as atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and heavy weapons exceeding agreed limits; (4) The Security Council should set limits on arms production, with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union each accounting for 20 percent; (5) A world peacekeeping force should be composed of volunteers from smaller countries. In the event of a war of aggression, the five major powers should be allowed to allocate troops to join the world peacekeeping force; (6) If any major power launches an arms race, other countries should immediately establish an international peacekeeping force; (7) The revised UN Charter should adopt the U.S. plan for universal inspection and control of atomic energy; (8) The Security Council should be reformed with two members each from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, one each from China and France, and two from other countries. Resolutions without veto power should be passed by a majority of six out of ten votes. The majority of House members have stated that they will support this plan.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman, speaking at the annual banquet of the American Society of Newspaper Editors tonight, believes that the world is at one of the decisive points in history. He said that the people of the whole world, after the most terrible war, are now re-deciding the way of civilization, and the United States is the main support for those who are rebuilding world civilization based on democratic and free principles. To enhance the strength of the United States, it is necessary for the whole country to support the anti-inflation plan that he submitted to Congress last November. Truman also said that the United States' assistance to others, although centered on economic assistance, should also be supplemented by sufficient military power so that others may have some sense of security during the reconstruction. The assistance provided by the United States will largely come from American agriculture, industry, and mines. The economic strength of the United States is a prerequisite for maintaining world freedom and peace; otherwise, the United States can neither help others nor lead others.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Amman, 17th, United Press] King Abdullah of Transjordan told a United Press reporter that he had specially dispatched Transjordanian troops to Palestine to fight against what he called "the threat of the Soviet Union and the Jews to the Arab world."

Squad Leader Xu immediately led a motorized vehicle team to Zhen Da Pawnshop based on the confession, seized a box of prepared morphine, and arrested suspects Liu Yongji, Chen Yaoshan, Cai Zhenmao, Liu Xikun, and Liu Chuxian. Boss Liu Lao San had fled Shanghai. The gendarmerie personnel then went to Liu Lao San's residence at No. 5, Lane 104, Wangting Street, seized raw materials for morphine and utensils for manufacturing drugs, and arrested a suspect, Zhou Dingren. They also arrested drug trafficking suspects Zheng Zichuan, Zheng Yuqiao, Zheng Ruitang, Zheng Jiazhi, Chen Liangshu, Zheng Renhai, and Zheng Guozhi at Fuli Pawnshop at No. 44, Luxiangyuan Road. After detailed interrogation by the team headquarters, except for Cai Ziying, Zheng Zichuan, Zheng Yuqiao, and Chen Liangshu, who admitted to manufacturing drugs or selling them for smoking, Zheng Guozhi and Zheng Renhai denied it, but according to Chen Liangshu's confession, they were suspected of participating in drug trafficking. Cai Chen Yun'e, wife of Cai Ziying, knew about it but concealed it without reporting it, which was obviously in conflict with the regulations on prohibiting smoking and drugs. The seven offenders were all scheduled to be sent to the Gendarmerie Headquarters today along with the drugs for interrogation. The remaining thirteen people were released on bail after a light investigation showed that they were not involved.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] U.S. Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, received reporters at the Navy Headquarters at 11 a.m. yesterday. U.S. Naval Advisory Group to China Chief Selber and U.S. Consul General Cabot were also present. During the meeting, Vice Admiral Badger stated that he had come to China twenty-five years ago, and was very friendly with old Chinese Navy generals such as Sa Zhenbing. In addition to naval personnel, Badger had many Chinese friends from all walks of life, so he said that he knew the Chinese situation quite well, sympathized with China, and was willing to help China wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Badger also said that the main task of the Seventh Fleet in China at present is to assist in the transport of U.S. aid materials to China, but the unloading work is quite difficult due to the lack of transportation tools such as railways, so the work is not progressing as quickly as expected. The original plan was to unload 8,000 tons per day in Shanghai, but the Shanghai docks can only unload 3,000 tons, and sometimes it is not easy to unload all 3,000 tons. These materials include food, industrial machinery, ships, etc. Because Badger's work requires him to go to various places to command or inspect, his headquarters is located in Qingdao, but he frequently travels back and forth throughout the Pacific.</p>
<p>When asked about the situation of U.S. Marines being detained by the Communists, Vice Admiral Badger said that he was still in contact with the Communist leaders and was communicating with each other by exchanging letters. He hopes to receive a reply from the other party in the next two or three days.</p>
<p>Regarding the 38 U.S. warships that will be donated to China, 28 patrol ships and 6 small auxiliary ships are in the Philippines, and the other 4 are in Florida, but the date of their arrival in China has not yet been determined. As for the Chinese Navy personnel (including officers and soldiers) receiving training from the U.S. in Qingdao, the number has reached 2,800.</p>
<p>Returning to Qingdao Tomorrow</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Badger is scheduled to return to Qingdao on his flagship "Estes" tomorrow morning (20th). Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., he also held a reception to entertain Chinese and foreign leaders. Mayor Wu and his wife attended.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Recovery of the Central District Racecourse, The Municipal Government Seeks Reasonable Solutions <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Regarding the issue of recovering the Central District Racecourse, the municipal government previously planned to exchange the Jiangwan Racecourse land, and the racecourse general association and other property rights groups requested an exchange ratio of eight to one, that is, one mu in the central district for eight mu in Jiangwan. After several negotiations, the property rights groups have retreated to five to one, but the municipal government believes that it must be exchanged at a reasonable ratio, so the opinions of the two sides are still far apart. Currently, the Municipal Government Counselor's Office is studying the possibility of proceeding with the land expropriation method, but because the racecourse is located in the central district and land prices are expensive, the municipal government is temporarily unable to bear this huge land price, so Mayor Wu is trying to solve this problem under the principle of seeking understanding.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] Before the war, there was a cross-river ferry service called the "Chunbei Line" operating between the Beijing Road Bund and the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong. The service was suspended during the war, which caused great inconvenience to passengers. After the victory, the municipal government immediately planned to restore it, and planned to expropriate the Pudong Zhongfang Spinning Factory (formerly Japanese-owned China Spinning Factory) wharf along the Huangpu River as a cross-river station. The Public Works Bureau was ordered to invite personnel from the Land Administration Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Municipal Ferry Company to conduct a survey. As a result, a part of the Zhongfang Spinning Factory's factory buildings had to be demolished due to actual needs, but it did not affect the factory's business. The municipal government is now rushing to prepare the expropriation plan and construction charts, and will submit them to the Executive Yuan for the allocation of the required land.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] The Staff Education Survey Committee of the Teachers College of Central University launched a comprehensive survey of Shanghai factories under the China Textile Construction Corporation, and the group survey work has largely come to an end last weekend. The chairman of the committee, Zhao Mian, also returned to Beijing yesterday after completing his work. Before leaving, he told reporters: "This staff education survey work was promoted by the efforts of the committee members, and with the assistance of China Textile, it was successfully completed, which is very gratifying." In addition to the committee members who originally worked in Beijing and have successively returned to Beijing, there are still consultation forms for labor welfare, technical research classes, and advanced training classes that need to be collected and transferred one after another, so some personnel are still left in Shanghai to be responsible for liaison. After returning to Beijing, he will work with the editing staff to start sorting and compiling statistics, draft a national staff education survey plan for factories, propose a plan for China Textile to promote staff education, and provide reference materials for studying China's industrial construction issues. The entire report is expected to be completed around the end of May.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Doubts Arise Over the Extension of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, The Lawyers Association Requests Interpretation <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Regulations on Punishing Corruption in Special Criminal Law were promulgated and implemented on June 30, 1943, and were amended and implemented on January 1, 1946. According to Article 14 of the regulations: "These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation for a period of two years." It had reached the statutory limit at the end of last year. The National Government issued an order on January 1 this year to extend it for one year, but this matter has aroused suspicion among judicial circles in the city. The reason is that this regulation is not the same as the Regulations on Punishing Bandits. Article 10 of the Regulations on Punishing Bandits has the words "may be extended by order when necessary," while the Regulations on Punishing Corruption do not have this clause. It must be passed by the Legislative Yuan before it can be considered legal. If it is only extended by order, it is inconsistent with the law. If a crime of corruption is committed after New Year's Day this year, it is possible to overturn it and be subject to ordinary criminal trial, which has a very significant impact. The reason why this regulation has caused doubts is that the Criminal Court No. 9 of the District Court recently tried the corruption case of Shen Zongchang, an employee of the Tax Bureau. During the trial of the case, Shen's defense lawyer Xu Jie suddenly raised the above issue and asked for an ordinary criminal trial. The judge was also unable to answer at the time. The outcome is quite noteworthy. It is heard that the city's Lawyers Association also intends to request an interpretation from the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Fujian Senators Passing Through Shanghai to Beijing, Urging That the Province's Grain Be Exempted from External Transportation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Fujian Provincial Senate believes that the province's grain prices have risen sharply and the people's hearts are extremely disturbed. Representatives are going to Beijing to request the central government to exempt the province's grain from external transportation in 1947 and retain it for people's food. Li et al. arrived in Shanghai from Fujian yesterday and especially hosted reporters at No. 31, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>Grain Prices Soar</p>
<p>According to the discussion: Fujian Province's agricultural products are mostly focused on timber, tea, etc., and grain has always been extremely scarce. In the past, it has relied entirely on foreign rice and grain input from neighboring provinces for supply. After the victory, rural production has not yet recovered, causing panic over the food problem of the province's 12 million people. Recently, the central government telegraphed the province to transport 100,000 large bags of grain from 1947, totaling more than 20 million catties, for external transportation. As soon as the news spread, Fujian's grain prices soared. The grain prices in Fuzhou and Xiamen have always been lower than those in Shanghai, but the current rice price in Fuzhou has risen to more than 6 million yuan per dan, and the rice price in Xiamen has exceeded 10 million yuan per dan, which is more than twice as high as that in Shanghai, and the rising trend is still increasing. It is heard that the city's Lawyers Association also intends to request an interpretation from the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>The People's Food Prospects Are Worrying</p>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Senate believes that the source of grain is insufficient and the grain price cannot be stabilized. If the batch of grain is transported externally, the prospects for the people's food in Fujian Province after the end of April will be unimaginable. Therefore, it has telegraphed the central government, requesting permission to pay the price according to the prescribed amount, and the Senate will pay the price in advance, and then purchase grain from other rice-producing provinces to pay as soon as possible, but it was not approved, so the Senate had to send representatives to Beijing to present the difficulties to the authorities and make earnest appeals to the National Assembly. Li et al. left Shanghai for Beijing last night. According to what they said before leaving: this trip to Beijing will strive to the end on the issue of exemption from external transportation.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] In order to adapt to the Special Criminal Court during the Suppression of the Rebellion, Mr. Wang Zhennan was appointed as the president of the court in this city. It has been more than a month since then. The organizational regulations and trial regulations of the Special Criminal Court have been passed by the Legislative Yuan for more than 20 days. However, the court has not yet officially investigated the cases. It is reported that the police bureau and the gendarmerie headquarters have transferred 49 cases to the court for investigation, and the number of defendants has reached more than 200. Among them, the defendants in the Dance Chao case and the workers' agitation case in Shenxin No. 9 Factory have been detained for more than 70 days, but they have not yet entered the judicial investigation procedure. The families of the defendants, who may be sentenced to life imprisonment, are quite concerned about this. A few days ago, they applied to the court for retrial, but the application was rejected. It is heard that the reason why the court has not yet started investigation and trial is that although the organizational regulations and trial regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan, the National Government has not yet promulgated them for implementation. It is expected that the court will formally investigate and try the cases after the National Government promulgates them for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Fanzang Temple Fires Tea Servers; Social Affairs Bureau Mediates This Morning <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fanzang Temple, a famous temple in this city, has a thriving business in Buddhist vegetarian cuisine. For business needs, it employs forty-two tea servers. The temple's abbot, Yang Dong, is known for his strict control over the tea servers, requiring a roll call every morning and mandatory chanting of scriptures twice a day. All the tea servers were very dissatisfied with these rules. Recently, the vegetarian tea cook occupational union was established, and all of Fanzang Temple's tea servers joined as members, with their foreman, Feng Xiao-ding, elected as a director. All the tea servers then jointly recommended Feng Xiao-ding to negotiate with Yang Dong, requesting the abolition of roll call and scripture chanting. On February 3, the vegetarian tea cook union held a meeting, and Feng Xiao-ding, as a director, attended despite the abbot's opposition. Yang Dong then claimed that the temple was hosting a banquet that day and all the tea servers should be serving the guests, but Feng did not request leave and left his post without permission, violating the temple's service regulations, and dismissed him. Feng Xiao-ding refused to accept this and applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. Section Chief Fan of the Social Affairs Bureau also believed that the reason for dismissal was too far-fetched, and advised the abbot to have compassion and allow Feng to continue working. Regarding Feng's mistake, he was ordered to write a letter of repentance and apologize to settle the matter. However, Yang Dong insisted on dismissing him, so the case has been delayed until now. Section Chief Fan notified both parties yesterday to come to the Social Affairs Bureau at 10 AM this morning for a final mediation.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon around 5 PM, an incident occurred at the junction of Zhongshan South Road and Jumen Road involving a police officer shooting and wounding a suspected extortionist. The wounded suspect, named Yu Sheng-chu, 41 years old, from northern Jiangsu, sustained a bullet wound to the buttocks. After being sent to Renji Hospital, the bullet was removed and he will be transferred to the Police Hospital this morning. The Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau refused to comment on the case yesterday because they were still in the process of arresting other fugitives. According to reports, the victim in the case, who lives in Deshun Lane, Zhejiang Road, recently received three threatening letters, initially demanding one hundred gold bars, then automatically reducing the demand to ten bars, and arranging to hand them over to a man holding a thermos bottle near the junction of Zhongshan South Road and Jumen Road yesterday afternoon. After the victim reported this to the Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, they sent officers in disguise to wait in advance. When the man holding the thermos bottle and another person arrived, the officers attempted to arrest them, but the two immediately fled. One of them, who was covering the retreat, was shot down by the police, and this was Yu Sheng-chu.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Fu Min Company Issues Statement on the Wanli Vessel Accident <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the grounding of the Fu Min Shipping Company's Wanli vessel at Shengshan, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the company's负责人 (responsible person) issued the following solemn statement regarding the accident and current situation of the Wanli vessel: "The Wanli vessel sailed from Tianjin to Shanghai on the 11th of this month and ran aground at the foot of the mainland mountain near Beishengshan on the morning of the 12th. Upon receiving news of the accident, our company immediately requested assistance from the US-China naval authorities and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as our company's other vessel, the Changcheng, is an oil tanker and diesel fuel was not available in time, so it could not sail. Since the 13th, after receiving a telegram from Captain Cai of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xilin vessel confirming that all passengers and crew had safely landed,专员 (special representatives) have been dispatched to Qingdao and Tianjin to arrange for all personnel to return to Shanghai, as detailed in various newspaper reports. As for the passengers carried by the Wanli vessel, there is a complete list of names and ticket stubs that can be verified. The vessel is a new ship built in the UK in 1944 and has been in use by our company for only five months. Its operating procedures comply with the regulations of the Maritime Administration Bureau and it has undergone legal inspection and holds a navigation license. It has regularly traveled between Tianjin and Shanghai in the past and is subject to fair criticism. After the Wanli vessel's accident, our company chartered a China National Aviation Corporation special plane, with Manager Yang De-chuan and representatives of the passengers' families flying to Qingdao and then to Yantai to make arrangements nearby, and established reception centers. The eagerness to rescue is a fact. Until recently, we have received several telegrams daily from Qingdao, Tianjin, and Yantai, and some passengers have already arrived in Yantai, which proves that the news of the rescue is constantly coming. Although our company's Changcheng vessel is short of oil, we are doing everything possible to strengthen the follow-up work and will sail directly from Tianjin to Yantai on the 20th to prepare to welcome the passengers back to Shanghai. Fearing that the truth is unclear, we are issuing this account."</p>

<h3 id="e80">Stamp Collecting is Full of Historical Anecdotes and Facts: Scattered Remnants Worth a Fortune; China's Earliest Stamps Appeared in the Fourth Year of the Guangxu Reign <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Stamp collecting in Shanghai was once extremely popular, but now it is not as prosperous as before. Many people who devoted themselves to the study and collection of stamp anecdotes have mostly given up their hobby due to difficult living conditions. Listening to two stamp collectors casually talk about the historical facts and current situation of stamp collecting really gives one an endless sense of desolation.</p>
<p>The earliest stamps in China appeared in the fourth year of the Guangxu reign. At that time, they were entrusted to the customs authorities by the Manchu Qing government and were divided into three denominations: one fen of silver, three fen of silver, and five fen of silver. The design on the stamps was very simple. The words "大清" (Great Qing) were printed horizontally at the top, with a giant dragon in the middle. The words "郵政局" (Postal Bureau) were to the right of the dragon, and the silver denomination was printed to the left of the dragon. Because the printing technology was not sophisticated at the time, the designs were all manually separated one by one, so the clouds around the dragon's body, the position of the dragon's claws, and the width of the edges were all slightly different. These have become the standards for stamp collectors to appreciate and price them today. The number of these "Large Dragon Stamps" in circulation is limited. Among them, perhaps there are those with blurred printing, interrupted lines in the design, or even slightly short or long strokes in the characters. Stamp collectors regard these as treasures. Each small piece of waste paper is worth a minimum of US$6 and a maximum of over US$500.</p>
<p>Rare and Treasured Old National Stamps</p>
<p>Among the stamps issued in the late Qing dynasty, the red three-fen stamp overprinted as one yuan is now known as the rarest national stamp in the Eastern Hemisphere. According to stamp collectors' research, the total number of these stamps issued was less than forty. Among the forty, in addition to the horizontal printing of "大清郵政" (Great Qing Post) and "1 dollar" being exactly the same, the black "當一圓" (Value One Yuan) overprint in the center is said to be divided into two font sizes, large and small. Stamps with the small "當一圓" are even rarer. Last year, one was discovered in Shanghai, which turned out to be four unused, connected stamps. As a result, Guo Zhi-fang, the general manager of Yongsha, bought it, paying a price equivalent to 30 gold bars. Later, it was confirmed that this stamp was an old item treasured by Divilia, who was the first to design stamp patterns for our country.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the famous stamp dealer Wu Le-yuan exchanged from abroad for a rare item that stamp collectors dreamed of. That was a five-yuan stamp printed by the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau in the third year of the Republic of China. The Beijing palace gate design in the center of the stamp was somehow printed upside down. Because it was printed upside down, and because research shows that the total number of these upside-down stamps is only forty-nine, and because one of the forty-nine was destroyed at the time, how could the discovery of one not be surprising? As a result, within a month, it was purchased by someone for a price equivalent to more than ten gold bars.</p>
<p>Overjoyed to Get a Treasure</p>
<p>In the spring of last year, a primary school student in Chongqing used 20,000 yuan of New Year's money to buy 50 of each stamp from half a cent to 20 yuan at the post office's stamp collecting department. Later, he discovered that among them, the two-yuan stamp of the美駧鈔議肢 (US Dollar Agreement Branch) in the 29th year had an upside-down image of the Premier in the center. The primary school student's father had played stamp collecting before and knew that he had gotten a treasure. His joy was truly extraordinary. Later, the news spread, and inquirers flocked to him. Of course, he sold it for a good price, as high as US$600 per stamp. This type of stamp was printed in the 29th year, and the upside-down printing was not discovered until the 36th year. Moreover, the upside-down blue-black color is the same as the color of the upside-down palace gate, so it added a valuable historical story to the stamp collecting world.</p>
<p>The world's oldest stamp is the one-penny black stamp of Queen Victoria's reign in Britain in 1840, but because the quantity is quite large and the circulation is wide, used stamps are only worth US$5, and new stamps are only worth US$35 each.</p>
<p>Rare and Precious Stamps Stolen</p>
<p>Only the one-cent stamp of British Guiana is the rarest stamp in the world. Currently, there is only one known internationally. It is said that a long time ago, it was also leaked from the hands of a primary school student for 1,006 pennies. Later, it passed into the hands of Mrs. Hient, who then sold it to the American merchant Graham for a high price of US$37,500. At the end of last year, Graham's residence was robbed. The thief entered the door, paid no attention to anything else, punched Graham unconscious, and stole this rare treasure. Its whereabouts are still unknown. The composition of this stamp's design only has a sailing ship, 　　　two 　, and no aesthetic appeal, but at the New York American Stamp Centenary International Stamp Exhibition last year, it occupied an unusually prominent and special position, priced at US$50,000, the most expensive stamp in the entire venue.</p>
<p>Several Chinese and Foreign Stamp Experts</p>
<p>China's most recently issued type of stamp is the 5,000-yuan denomination issued on Postal Commemoration Day. It includes two commemorative designs: the right side is a one-jiao stamp commemorating the restoration of the Republic of China, and the left side is a 500-yuan stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Directorate General of Posts. The earliest and most recent stamps in the history of the Republic of China are included. It is said that the design of this pattern was made by the post office at the suggestion of stamp collectors. Stamp collectors purchase large quantities of each new stamp when it is issued, which is a major source of income for the post office. Speaking of stamp collectors, people easily think of the late President Roosevelt, former British King George V, and British Princess Elizabeth. In fact, several Chinese stamp collectors also have some reputation internationally, such as Zhou Jin-jue, who is over sixty years old, Zhong Xiao-lu, who specializes in modern stamps, Guo Zhi-fang, who specializes in valuable stamps, Zhang Geng-bo, the chief editor of Xin Guang Stamp Journal and Stamp Dictionary, Ma Ren-quan, the general manager of Shunchang Cement Factory, Xu Bo-ming, the general manager of Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and famous stamp dealers Yan Xi-qiao, Wu Le-yuan, and Chen Fu-xiang.</p>
<p>Immersed in it, Forgetting Everything Else</p>
<p>They have almost become addicted to stamp collecting, immersed in it, forgetting everything outside themselves. When they appraise a stamp, the number of stamps issued, the thickness and color depth of the paper, the variant of the characters, and the number of perforations around the perimeter are all standards that determine its quality, value, and cost. The common number of perforations on each side of a stamp is fourteen and a half. If the printer accidentally used another type of perforating machine when perforating the stamps, causing an absolutely small number of stamps to change to twelve or eleven and a half degrees, then that stamp would immediately be listed in "郵乘" (Zhou Fang-hou's stamp collecting magazine), become priceless, and become a famous item that stamp collectors at home and abroad desperately want to obtain.</p>

<p>According to the service department of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently plans to combine land, sea and air transportation. After discussing with the two railway bureaus and China Central Airlines respectively, a preliminary agreement has been reached. For land-sea combined transportation, it has been decided that the waterway will be from Tianjin to Shanghai and Nanjing to Hankou, and the land route will be from Shanghai to Nanjing and Hangzhou. Combined transportation of passenger tickets and luggage will be handled within these above-mentioned locations. In the future, it is planned to extend from Tianjin to the Beining Railway and to Shenyang. Hankou will extend from the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. In this way, the Northeast, North China, Central China, and South China can be transported smoothly without obstruction. The detailed methods are being negotiated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the various railway bureaus, and will be officially implemented soon.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Rationing of Japanese Reparations Materials: Preferential Treatment for Factories in the Rear Areas; Earnest Study of Methods <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of Japanese reparations industrial materials has been continuously shipped back to China. The Executive Yuan previously formulated measures for private enterprises to apply for reparations materials, which were originally scheduled to end on March 15. For this reason, the National Wartime Relocated Factories Petition Group sent more than 30 representatives to Beijing three times to petition the relevant authorities. Recently, the group's representatives, Xie Tian-sha and others, returned to Shanghai from Beijing and said: Zhang Qun, Wang Yun-wu, and other vice presidents paid close attention to this matter and submitted it to the Political Affairs Meeting, deciding to extend the application period by one month to April 15. Xie also said: Regarding the preferential payment methods for relocated factories in the rear areas, Zhang and Wang understood the government's orders to relocate when the war of resistance broke out, sent personnel to supervise and guide, and promised to assist in the restoration of factories after the victory, as well as the experiences of relocated factories in the rear areas during the war, whether due to military retreats, enemy air raids, or shutdowns and layoffs after the victory. Regarding the preferential methods for relocated factories in the rear areas, the group's representatives in Beijing, Wu Yun-chu, Li Zhu-ao, Xue Ming-jian, Pan Yang-shan, Li Jian-ting, Tao Gui-lin, and Li Zu-shen, consulted with the authorities in many ways. In view of the government's financial difficulties, they did not request further concessions on the fixed US dollar price, but only requested that the payment be one-quarter upfront and that the original two-year payment period be extended to five years. This proposal was also submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting and handed over to Zhang Jia-ao, Chen Qi-tian, and others for earnest study before being submitted to the meeting again. It is reported that preliminary statistics show that relocated factories in the rear areas have applied for more than 2,000 pieces of this type of reparations machinery.</p>

<p>Ding Hui Requests Severe Punishment of Perpetrators</p>
<p>The Shunxing Teahouse on Xinmin Road in this city owes the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company water and electricity bills for three months, totaling approximately 70 million yuan. The company considered the debt a violation of regulations and sent workers Yan San-lang, Zhang Zhang-gen, and others to cut the lines on the 16th and suspend the electricity supply. However, when the workers went to carry out the work, the owner of the teahouse, Chen Xue-qin, ordered the shop assistants to surround and beat Yan and others, injuring them. After learning of this, the company, in addition to immediately sending the two injured workers to the Fourth Hospital for emergency treatment, also sent employees to the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau to send the police to cut the lines again, but they were also rejected by the shopkeeper. The director of the sub-bureau, Zhou Guan-zi, went in person to cut off the wires and stop the water supply. All the workers in the factory were outraged that their colleagues were beaten for performing their duties and were injured for no reason. The industrial union has now submitted a request to the Municipal General Labor Union and to the relevant authorities to severely punish the perpetrators, and Chen is also required to provide guarantees to the workers, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e91">General Commodity Price Fluctuation Decreases, Entering a Period of Intermission <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Commodity prices fluctuated greatly after the lunar New Year, reaching a climax in the second week of March. The percentages of increase in various commodity price indices were quite sharp, but subsequently, the amplitude of commodity price fluctuations gradually decreased, and the money supply tightened, seemingly entering a period of intermission after the major fluctuations. This state persisted until the first week of April, lasting for about three weeks. By the previous week, namely the second week of April, commodity prices were still very stable at the beginning of the week due to the carry-over from the previous period's weakness. Later, influenced by factors such as the suspension of deferred settlement on the stock exchange, the prolongation of foreign exchange, and the increase in prices of public utilities in this city, another wave of price increases was triggered. Judging from this publication's recent wholesale price index, it increased by six percent in the third week of March, 4.4 percent in the fourth week, 1.9 percent in the first week of April, and 3.19 percent in the second week, which are all relatively stable. The reasons for the slowdown in this wave of price increases and its details have been described in detail in previous issues of this publication.</p>
<p>Last week, general commodity prices, starting from Monday, showed weakness again compared to the previous weekend. However, on Thursday, due to rumors in the market about another prolongation of foreign exchange, there was some stimulus, and general commodity prices slightly rebounded. The money supply remained very loose last week. The unofficial interest rate stood at 2.5 jiao on Monday and Tuesday. After Wednesday, it slightly improved, fluctuating between 2.5 and 2.7 or 8 jiao. Based on past experience, this situation has the potential to trigger a wave of general commodity price increases. However, in general, commodity prices last week were still considered stable. Analyzing the reasons, it is nothing more than the gradual materialization of developments pointed out in this publication's previous issues, such as the success of the U.S. loan, the sale of state-owned enterprises, and the issuance of short-term treasury bills. Specifically, first, regarding the U.S. loan, it has entered the implementation stage since the U.S. President signed the foreign aid bill. The recent contact between our country's Ambassador to the U.S., Gu, and Mr. Kong Xiangxi with the U.S. Secretary of State, and Mr. Bei Zuyi's impending return to the country, all indicate that the U.S. loan mission is about to be completed. Furthermore, looking at the negotiations between Ambassador Gu and the U.S. authorities, it seems that the U.S. loan is still lacking a "letter of opinion" as a formality in its implementation. This formality is one of the conditions stipulated in the U.S. loan plan. The Chinese government will submit its letter of opinion as soon as it receives this notification from the U.S. Department of State. Second, regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, according to Finance Minister Yu's report to the National Assembly on the 13th, a method for selling state-owned enterprises to enrich legal tender reserves has recently been drafted, allocating assets from the China Textile Company (中紡公司) valued at US$200 million, assets from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) valued at US$100 million, assets from the National Resources Commission (資源委員會) valued at US$50 million, and a portion of Japanese reparations materials valued at US$80 million, totaling over US$400 million. As for the respective units, they are also actively preparing to handle the valuation and issuance of stocks for the allocated assets. For example, the asset valuation committee of the China Textile Company (中紡公司) passed the valuation of the company's assets in Qingdao and Tianjin at its meeting on the 12th (the Shanghai portion had already been approved). The valuation of machinery, power, and buildings is based on the year 1937, and the valuation of real estate is based on the year 1947. The respective figures are as follows: (1) Valuation of machinery, power, and buildings in 1937: Shanghai 91,800,748 yuan, Qingdao 55,123,758 yuan, Tianjin 45,596,708 yuan, totaling 193,521,214 yuan. Valuation of real estate in 1947: Shanghai 20,452,158 yuan, Qingdao 10,319,630 yuan, Tianjin 26,514,390 yuan, totaling 241,355,600 yuan. The valuation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) is also in preparation. Third, regarding the issuance of short-term treasury bills, the regulations for this issuance were formally passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. According to reports, the main points of the articles are that the Central Bank can issue them as needed by the market, without any limit on the amount, and they can be sold at a discount in the market or redeemed upon maturity. The above-mentioned factors are all major changes rarely seen in the economy since the victory. Once implemented, their impact will naturally be greatly valued. Therefore, under the current circumstances, the market is showing a relatively quiet scene, which is actually due to the fact that major buyers and sellers are all cautious in the face of these major economic changes, resulting in a temporary wait-and-see attitude. In summary, last week was actually a period of temporary tranquility before the storm. In addition, the government made efforts last week on measures related to stabilizing commodity prices, approximately including: (1) Regarding the case of allowing partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange for importing industrial raw materials and production equipment, according to news from the Import and Export Control Commission, this new measure has now reached the decision stage and will be announced and implemented within days. We expect that once this measure is implemented, its impact will not be limited to the import and export industry itself; (2) The government had long ago ordered that public funds of military and government agencies should be deposited in the national treasury. Recently, it further ordered the three banks and two bureaus to transfer agency deposits to the national treasury and to accept inspections by the Central Bank. Therefore, the National Treasury Bureau has established additional revenue and expenditure offices in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is said that the handling is quite smooth; (3) The Ministry of Finance ordered the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau to limit the same-day use of banknotes from money shops (行莊). The intention is nothing more than to delay the rise in commodity prices by reducing the turnover rate of currency; (4) At the end of last year, in order to stabilize commodity prices, the government stopped lending. Later, in order to help industrial and commercial enterprises finance and overcome difficulties, it carried out the purchase of finished products. Now, there are rumors that the Central Trust Bureau is about to auction off the purchased finished products, which is quite thought-provoking for those who hold goods and for the market's floating capital; (5) The rumor of the Food Distribution Committee purchasing food rice is also rampant, with a strong sense of inevitability. On the Food Distribution Committee's side, the purchase is for the purpose of regulating the market, which is certainly justifiable. However, if we look at the entire market, is the state of depression only limited to the grain industry? Here, we recall the fourth major fluctuation in commodity prices after the victory, from the beginning of April to the beginning of June last year, when the overall index rose by 64%. At that time, the leading price increases were goods for compensation, mainly food that was massively purchased. Looking back at the past, how can we not turn pale at the mention of it? We hope that the government will carefully handle this important necessity of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Under the aforementioned situation of dense clouds but no rain, the general trend of commodity prices last week did not fluctuate greatly, and no new prices were seen. Regarding cotton cloth, such as 42-count Blue Phoenix, it consistently hovered around the edge of 230 million. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 4.8 million on Monday to 4.71 million on Thursday, and rebounded to 4.77 million from Friday, with a fluctuation range of no more than 100,000. Regarding grain, Shangbai Geng (上白粳) rice fell from 3.75 million on Monday to 3.65 million on Wednesday. It rebounded to 3.7 million on Thursday due to rain and fewer arrivals. From Friday, due to reports of rising rice prices in the Su-Xi producing areas and rumors of the Food Distribution Committee purchasing again, it rebounded again, reaching 3.85 million in the North Market. The trend of edible oil and miscellaneous grains was roughly the same as that of rice and grain. As for other items such as building materials, chemicals, and metals, only slight rises and falls were seen, and the amplitude of fluctuations was small. The wholesale price index for last week, classified by usage, is as follows:</p>

<p>During the past week in Shanghai, among the five major commercial ports of Guangzhou, Xiamen, Chongqing, Hankou, and Tianjin, the exchange rates to all ports except Chongqing have repeatedly decreased, and the discount in Tianjin has correspondingly increased. This is partly due to the reduction of remittance discounts in Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Hankou, and the high cost of wood in Tianjin. On the other hand, it can also be inferred that the money supply in this city is loose. The increase in the Tianjin remittance discount further indicates the drastic flow of funds from the north to the south. The following is a table of the exchange discounts and fluctuations of commercial banks in this city to the five major ports such as Guangzhou last week:</p>
<p>Day	6 (Previous Week)	1 (Last Week)	2	3	4	5</p>
<p>Guangzhou	170	170	170	120	120	100</p>
<p>Xiamen	200	200	130	120	120	120</p>
<p>Chongqing	30	30	40	40	60	50</p>
<p>Hankou	120	100	90	90	80	60</p>
<p>Tianjin (Discount)	30	30	30	30	50	80</p>
<h3 id="e92">Currency and Finance <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>(1) Unofficial Interest Rates on Money Supply</p>
<p>Although signs of tightening money supply in this city were repeatedly evident last week, the general market conditions were weak, and the demand for funds was not very urgent. On the contrary, in terms of the supply of funds, the expenditure of the national treasury was as large as before, and the national banks and bureaus had some inflows during the week, but the amount was not large, this is one reason. There were quite a few remittances flowing into this city from various places, this is another reason. Furthermore, the tools that could help tighten the money supply, such as the sale of finished products purchased at the end of the lunar new year last year, the issuance of treasury bills, and the sale of state-owned enterprises, are all still under consideration, this is a third reason. These three reasons cannot reduce the supply of funds in the market. Therefore, the money supply in this city last week generally showed a trend of wanting to tighten but remaining loose. First, looking at the exchange difference of the national banks and bureaus last week, although the total exchange amount of the national banks and bureaus from Monday to Friday was a difference of 10.351 trillion, if the total amount of 8.25 trillion deposited by commercial banks to the Central Bank within five days is deducted, the actual difference of the national banks and bureaus is only 200 billion, which has a very weak effect on tightening the money supply.</p>
<p>As for the unofficial interest rate in this city last week, although there were high prices of 3 jiao on Thursday and Friday, they were not universal and soon declined. Last week, most transactions were done at 2.7 or 8 jiao. As for the interest rates outside the securities exchange, they were generally stable between 16 yuan and 19 yuan, with little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Commercial banks and money shops also saw a mild situation in terms of funds. Although interbank lending was quite active, it was not difficult due to the abundant supply. The clearing houses after number 60 had a total difference of 12.367 trillion from Monday to Friday in five days. Among them, the differences on Monday and Thursday were the largest, exceeding 4 trillion, and the difference on Tuesday was no more than 800 billion. The amount of cash deposited by the money shops to the Central Bank within five days to offset the slips was about 350 billion, which cannot be considered a large amount, and the mildness of the money shops' funds can be further proved.</p>
<p>The amount of difference in foreign banks increased again last week. From Monday to Friday, the total difference in five days was 7.04 trillion, and the amount of inflow each day was over 100 billion, with the difference on Thursday being the largest at 2.272 trillion. It is said that a large part of it was remittances flowing south, in addition to the installment repayments by commercial banks. This is noteworthy.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Although there were rumors last week that the benchmark rate for foreign exchange would be raised again, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (平準基金會) denied it with emphasis, claiming that "the foreign exchange will definitely not be adjusted again," and the situation calmed down. The U.S. and British exchange rates remained at their original levels of 324,000 yuan and 972,000 yuan, respectively. The Hong Kong remittance also remained quite stable last week. Before Thursday, it was maintained at the level of 100,000 legal tender for 8 jiao and 8 or 9 fen in Hong Kong dollars. The market price of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong was also stable between 5 yuan and 6 jiao and 4 or 5 fen in Hong Kong dollars, which was slightly smaller than the market price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao and 6 fen on the previous weekend.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>Although the general money supply was still considered loose last week, there were not many positive factors. The Hong Kong remittance rate was consistently maintained between 8 jiao and 8 or 9 fen. Although there were rumors of an increase in the foreign exchange benchmark rate, the rumors were soon denied by the authorities of the Exchange Stabilization Fund (基金會). Furthermore, the authorities seem to be making every effort to promote the sale of state-owned enterprises. In order to meet the needs of private capital, there were individual sales of units of the China Textile Company (中紡公司), and the finished products purchased at the end of last year were also being dumped. The regulations for the issuance of short-term treasury bills were also formally passed by the Legislative Yuan. All indications suggest that the authorities are quite determined to tighten the money supply. These phenomena undoubtedly added a shadow to the future of the stock market. Major investors are unwilling to increase their investments, and retail investors are also mostly waiting and watching. Although the trend of Chinese stocks last week was still considered weak to stable, comparing the closing prices on Friday of last week with those on Friday of the previous week, some stocks fell by more than 10%. Among them, Yong Yarn (永紗) fell by about 8%, Jinglun (景綸) fell by 10%, China Silk (中絲) fell by 12%, and Xinyi (信誼) fell by about half a percent. All other stocks also showed a consistent softening trend. Even considering the process within the five days from Monday to Friday of last week, although there were no significant ups and downs in the stocks, the trend was weak and lacking in strength.</p>
<p>The trend of foreign stocks was also weak. The amplitude of fluctuations last week was quite narrow. Yisha (怡紗) consistently fluctuated between 2.4 million and 2.6 million. Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco also only had ups and downs of 20 or 30 yuan. Those in the industry were not very interested, and the reduction in the Hong Kong exchange rate was limited. Although the money supply was considered loose, the interbank interest rate did not decrease, resulting in a decrease in the transaction volume. Other financial commodities consistently declined last week. The stagnation of foreign exchange rates also significantly affected the sluggishness of foreign stocks. However, this latent state is likely to be a short-term phenomenon. After all, foreign stocks are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and are less restricted than Chinese stocks. They are also not affected by inflation, and there will be an unbalanced development in the future. Furthermore, Chinese stocks have repeatedly increased capital, and the number of stocks has expanded, almost rivaling the currency, while foreign stocks have always maintained their original form. Scarcity increases value, and it is also a shortcut for capital to escape. During major environmental fluctuations, it often paves the way for foreign stocks, which should be paid attention to.</p>

<p>The Sale of State-Owned Yarn Factories in the Cotton Textile Industry's Adversity</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, the United Press International in San Francisco released a telegram quoting an expert on Far Eastern issues, stating that U.S. aid to China under the Consolidated Foreign Assistance Act was too small to provide long-term recovery. The expert also believed that the value of the Chinese currency would continue to fall and even collapse completely. The conclusion was that even if new currency was issued before the end of the civil war, the prospects were not optimistic. However, we all know that the so-called "suppression of the rebellion" is the current government's established "national policy" and is difficult to change. Moreover, in order to make further efforts, as Finance Minister Yu claimed in his financial report at the National Assembly meeting on the 13th, the government has recently drafted a method for selling state-owned enterprise assets to enrich legal tender assets, that is, allocating assets from the China Textile Company (中紡公司) valued at US$200 million, assets from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) valued at US$100 million, assets from the National Resources Commission (資源委員會) valued at US$50 million, and reparations materials valued at approximately US$80 million, to be handed over to the Central Bank to establish a special account as part of the legal tender reserve. On this new foundation of legal tender reserves, the government can apparently engage in new activities beyond the 70 trillion issuance.</p>
<p>In order to actively promote the sale of state-owned enterprises mentioned above, the Asset Valuation Committee of the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) held its final meeting at 3 p.m. on the 12th in the company's conference room, determining the valuation of the company's assets in Qingdao and Tianjin. As for the portion in this city, it had already been approved. The valuation of machinery, power, and buildings is based on the year 1937, with a total value of more than 193 million yuan in the three locations. The valuation of real estate is based on the year 1947, with a total value of more than 241 billion yuan in the three locations. As for how to convert the above-mentioned valuation figures into U.S. dollars, the committee proposed two methods for the authorities to refer to. The first is to convert the above-mentioned figures into U.S. dollars based on the ratio of U.S. dollars to legal tender in 1937. The second method is to first increase the valuation figures based on the price index, and then convert them into U.S. dollars according to the current ratio of U.S. dollars to legal tender. According to the central government's regulations, two-thirds of the assets of the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) will be sold to private enterprises, and one-third will be retained as state-owned. The value of this two-thirds is estimated to be equivalent to approximately US$200 million. If it is sold to private enterprises, it is indeed an unprecedented transaction. It is reported that the equity and property rights of the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) are being transferred to the Central Bank, which will take over and handle the issuance of stocks or sales in accordance with the methods approved by the State Council. It is reported that the China Textile Company (中紡公司) is scheduled to formally issue stocks on the 15th of next month. The issuance is entrusted to the Bank of China (中國銀行).</p>
<p>Here, we will only discuss the sale of approximately US$200 million worth of assets of the China Textile Company (中紡公司) to private enterprises. In today's situation of general decline in people's livelihoods, the destination of these equity and property rights is noteworthy. If more than half of the equity is manipulated by foreign forces or controlled by a few domestic wealthy capital, it will not only be useless to the general national economy and people's livelihoods, but may even be infinitely harmful.</p>
<p>Considering the capital strength of private enterprises a month ago, it can indeed be said that large state-owned enterprises cannot be purchased by the capital strength of general private enterprises. Furthermore, considering the recent trend of factories relocating south in this city, it is also doubtful whether state-owned enterprises can be successfully sold to private enterprises. According to news from the East China News Agency (華東社), amidst the intense economic turmoil in this city, many industrial and commercial enterprises are relocating south because it is difficult to continue to maintain their operations. Among them, in the case of textile factories, about ten have recently relocated to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other areas in South China. At the end of the previous week, the Shenxin Yarn Factory (申新紗廠) transported 700 tons of textile machinery to Guangzhou for installation and operation. The agency also reported a conversation with an authoritative figure in the industrial sector, roughly stating that due to the instability of wartime economy, the relocation of factories from Shanghai to the south has become a trend. However, the methods of relocation vary. Although no factories have yet been found to have relocated all of their machinery and equipment to the south, it is heard that some manufacturers are making preparations. Several manufacturers have already relocated partially, and their focus will continue to shift south. There are also some manufacturers who originally planned to transport new machines ordered in the United States to Shanghai for installation and expansion, but have changed their plans to transport them directly to Guangzhou and Hong Kong for unloading and establishment of factories in those areas.</p>
<p>In this case, after private capital purchases state-owned enterprises, it can relocate to South China for development. However, the actual situation is not as simple as it seems. Putting aside the huge costs of transportation and installation, even if state-owned enterprises can be successfully dismantled and relocated to the south, the current situation in South China is no longer what it used to be. The Shanghai Financial Daily (本市金融日報) published a Guangzhou shipping report last Thursday, roughly stating that "most factories in Guangzhou have stopped production because there is too much inventory and it cannot be sold, affecting the sluggish market for industrial raw materials. No one is willing to purchase factory import quotas... Due to the crazy rise of the Hong Kong dollar, which seems to have no end, purchasing power has been greatly reduced. Furthermore, the regulations to prevent floating capital from flowing south (limiting each person to bring 50 million yuan into Guangzhou) have caused customer groups from Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and Jiangxi to be afraid to come south for trade in recent months. Import inspections are very strict, and the real flow of floating capital south has not been blocked. Therefore, the funds for commercial turnover have been cut off, making it difficult for all factories to shut down. Guangzhou's commerce is also likely to wither under the storm."</p>
<p>The situation of private yarn factories determines the extent to which state-owned yarn factories can be sold. This publication has previously summarized the severe crisis caused by the lack of raw cotton in the yarn factories in this city. The supply of raw cotton, in addition to relying on the import of foreign cotton, also relies on cotton merchants purchasing domestic cotton from cotton-producing areas. A certain person in charge of the Cotton Merchants' Joint Purchase Agency (棉商承購棉花聯營處) criticized the yarn authorities, so the yarn authorities issued a simplified method for allocating working capital last week. Although cotton merchants say that they are absolutely confident in purchasing cotton, as of the 10th of this month, the total purchase amount is only 30,000 dan, which is far from the original target of purchasing 1 million dan.</p>
<p>Today, when the situation in the spinning and weaving industry has not improved, the government wants to use the sale of state-owned yarn factories as a means to raise issuance reserves to achieve the goal of stabilizing currency value, and private factories want to use the purchase of state-owned enterprises as a means to achieve the goal of wealth accumulation. I am afraid it is difficult to escape the judgment of the American expert on Far Eastern issues quoted at the beginning of this article. If this is true, then it is natural for state-owned enterprises to be controlled by wealthy capital or foreign forces with special backgrounds and special methods. We may as well wait and see for the facts to explain.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Tungsten Ore Investigation <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Storage, Transportation, Production and Sales of Tungsten Ore</p>
<p>Tracing back to World War I, the urgent need for various rare metals in the manufacture of heavy weapons was especially pressing for tungsten ore. It was discovered that China's tungsten ore reserves were the most abundant. Experts estimate that they account for about 70% of the world's total reserves, totaling 4,170,255 metric tons, distributed in the following provinces:</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 4,000,000 metric tons</p>
<p>Southern: 4,000,000 metric tons</p>
<p>Hunan: 21,400 metric tons</p>
<p>Guangdong: 148,855 metric tons</p>
<p>Total: 4,170,255 metric tons</p>
<p>Recently, tungsten ore with a tungsten content of 4.6% has also been discovered in Suiyuan and Liaoning. Yunnan and Guangxi account for only a small amount, but the exact reserves are still unknown. Tungsten ore is produced from Southwest to Northeast China, with Jiangxi being the most famous.</p>
<p>Jiangxi's tungsten mines are distributed in Huichang, Dayu, Anyuan, Ganxian, Nankang, Longbu, Taihe, Xingguo, Shangyou, and Yudu in southern Jiangxi. Recently, a new tungsten mine has been discovered in Nanfeng County, which is famous for producing oranges. Not only is the tungsten of excellent quality, but its reserves are estimated to account for half of Jiangxi Province's total.</p>
<p>Currently, China supplies 40% of the world's tungsten, making it one of the most important export commodities and a major guarantee for loans from the United States over the years.</p>
<p>Since 1932, the government has been in charge of mining. The highest production volume in the past 15 years was in 1939.</p>
<p>In 1938, China once established a tungsten refining plant in Shangangshan, Ji'an, Jiangxi, intending to refine it, but it was destroyed by the Japanese. To this day, it is still exported in the form of raw ore. Most of it is transported from southern Jiangxi to Hong Kong via the Yuehan Railway, and then transshipped from Hong Kong for export. Smuggling is also common. However, since January 5th of this year, after the signing of the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement, eight major export commodities from China must have China's export documents before they are allowed to be transshipped from Hong Kong for export. Tungsten ore is one of them. From the date of signing the agreement to the end of last month, a total of 23,056 dan of tungsten ore have been exported from Hong Kong. The current price of tungsten in Hong Kong is about HK$300 per dan, worth a total of HK$7 million.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Batavia] Ms. Chen Rongtang, the captain of the Shanghai women's basketball team who won the women's basketball championship in the previous National Games, and a veteran who holds the national record for women's discus and softball throws, is an overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies. She grew up in Xijiang, West Celebes. In 1928, she returned from Xijiang to study at Jimei School in Fujian. In 1934, she transferred to Shanghai Dongya Physical Education College. In 1936, she participated in the National Games and won several women's championships, becoming famous far and wide. Her national record for softball throw is 51.53 meters, and her discus throw is 30.055 meters, which are still held by Ms. Chen. In 1937, she returned to Xijiang and married Yang Dielin, a famous hunter and the first person in China to capture a panda alive. When the "July 7th" Incident broke out, she moved to Macau and Hong Kong, and continued to train the women's basketball champion team. In 1941, she returned to Xijiang to visit her relatives and organized the Xijiang women's basketball team, which was powerful and successful. Later, due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, Ms. Chen lived in seclusion in the mountains. After the Southern Islands were recovered, she originally planned to return to China, but she did not make the trip because her husband served at the consulate in Xijiang. She now has two children, but she is preparing to "make a comeback" and prepare for further development in basketball and track and field events. This time, she was hired as the manager of the women's basketball team for the Indonesian overseas Chinese athletes participating in the National Games. She returned to Shanghai with the Indonesian overseas Chinese athletes on April 8. (Reported by Wu Guoqiang)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch] The student grades for the previous semester at Jiaotong University have been calculated and announced. More than 200 students failed to reach two-thirds or one-third of the credits and should be held back or expelled according to the regulations of the Ministry. These students gathered to discuss the matter a few days ago and asked the school to relax the handling standards. Their reasons are that: (1) the school's food and nutrition are too poor today, and the efficiency of studying has decreased; (2) generally, it is because the source of economic income has been cut off, and they are working as tutors outside, which affects their studies and is by no means self-abandonment and willing to lag behind. Other students have written articles expressing their sympathy and asking the school to make a wise decision.</p>

<p>Editor: I am sending a letter to the Director of the Public Works Bureau and would like to ask you to publish it on my behalf. Thank you very much. The letter reads: "Respectfully presented, Tongji Road, west of Tiantong'an Station in Zhabei, between Baoshan Road and Jiangwan Road, poses a considerable threat to the safety of pedestrians, especially in the morning when it rains, the danger of young students walking on this road is truly unimaginable. I believe that the reasons why this section of the road has formed a dangerous situation are as follows: (1) the road is too narrow (2) there are too many trucks and cars, and they are driving very fast (3) the sidewalks on both sides are only dirt, which is slippery and uneven, making it inconvenient to walk (4) vegetable stalls are lined up in the morning, further obstructing the sidewalks (5) there are many young students coming and going near the school area. Previously, a child was run over and killed on this section of the road, which is chilling to think about. I sincerely hope that you will find a way to improve the traffic situation in this area, and this virtuous policy will be silently blessed by the residents nearby. Sincerely, Citizen Li Shaohong."</p>

<h3 id="e124">A MIRACULOUS DISCOVERY IN CHINESE BOTANY <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xiao Zhao</p>
<p>Those who study plant taxonomy always hope to discover new plants. However, since Linnaeus' classification system nearly two hundred years ago, many plants, especially higher plants, have been studied and already have scientific names. Experienced taxonomists can still discover new species, but new genera are rare, and new families are practically unheard of. China, with its vast territory and abundant resources, has a rich variety of plants. Due to the slow development of scientific research, plant taxonomy in China remains extremely important and offers great hope for discovery. Over the past thirty years, under the leadership of experts such as Hu Hsien-Hsu, Chien Chung-shu, and Chen Huan-yong, many new species and genera have been discovered. The collection work in China's vast territory is not yet complete, and the potential for future discoveries is limitless.</p>
<p>The longest-lived and largest plant in the world is the California redwood (Sequoia gigantea). It is said to have several thousand years of history, and a car can pass through its hollow trunk, which shows how large it is. But even more extraordinary plants have now been discovered in China. At first, you might not believe it, but the fact is there, beyond doubt. That is the "living fossil" – the Metasequoia – discovered by Professor Zheng Wan-jun and his team from the Forestry Department of National Central University in Nanjing in February of last year, at the border of northern Sichuan.</p>
<p>The story goes like this: Dr. Hu Hsien-Hsu, Director of the Peking Institute of Botany, based on his long-standing reputation for cooperation with the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in the United States, received further funding from Harvard last year. He dispatched a collecting team to work in the border area between Sichuan and Hubei. Under the guidance of Professor Zheng Wan-jun, Wang Zhan-jun of the Forestry Improvement Bureau discovered three of these "living fossil" Metasequoia trees. These were the same as the fossils first discovered in Montana, USA, in 1941, and later found on Sakhalin Island and in Northeast China. These fossil Metasequoia trees grew at the same time as giant lizards and dinosaurs, at least 100 million years ago. At that time, the vast plains of the Northern Hemisphere were covered with these Metasequoia trees. Later, due to abrupt climate changes, they gradually disappeared. It is truly unexpected that there are still living Metasequoia trees in western China. This is truly astonishing, a miracle in botany, and undoubtedly a groundbreaking discovery. Professor Zheng sent Assistant Xue Ji-ru to investigate for a second time and discovered another twenty-five of these trees. The collecting team set out for the third time in September of last year, spending three months and discovering a total of over one hundred Metasequoia trees. They are all wild, found on slopes about 3,000 feet high in Hubei and Sichuan. Professor Chaney (Proj. Chaney), head of the Paleontology Department at the University of California, specially came to China from the United States for this purpose, personally went to Badong for investigation, and collected many seeds, preparing to take them back to the United States for sowing. Soon, all botanical gardens around the world will have seedlings of this fossil Metasequoia. Professor Chaney, together with Director Hu Hsien-Hsu and Professor Zheng Wan-jun, conducted joint research on this newly discovered miraculous plant that has lived for millions of years. They have also suggested to the Chinese government to turn the native habitat of the Metasequoia into a national park. The Ministry of Education, Academia Sinica, the Peking Institute of Botany, and National Central University will jointly organize it. This is truly a part of scientific and constructive efforts.</p>
<p>According to preliminary research, this Metasequoia is not only a new species but also a new genus and can even be established as a new family (family name yet to be determined). The Taxaceae family and many cypress species of the Pinaceae family are all derived from this living fossil Metasequoia. The phyllotaxy theories of opposite and alternate leaves in plant morphology will also need to be changed. The tree is about 100 feet tall, with beautiful needles, and the wood is quite soft and grows very quickly, suitable for papermaking. In short, this discovery is too significant and too interesting. It is unexpected that this area of Hubei and Sichuan has been collected by so many Western botanists, who rested in the shade of Metasequoia trees without discovering them. It was left for our own Chinese botanists to discover, and that alone is enough to create a miracle. This is undoubtedly a major encouragement to our young Chinese botanists and deserves to be publicized.</p>
<p>Dr. K.D. Merrill, a renowned figure in the American botanical community, professor at Harvard University, and former director of the Arnold Arboretum, expressed great interest in this significant discovery. He especially congratulated the achievements of the Chinese botanical community, considering China a sacred land for the study of botany. He refrained from presuming to name and describe this new plant, leaving it to Chinese botanists to prepare and publish the paper, because whoever names and studies it will gain immortal fame.</p>

<p>— Chong Xi</p>
<p>Dr. Julian Huxley, the current Secretary-General of UNESCO, is the eldest grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley, the famous 19th-century British biologist. He was born in 1887, and his father, Lenard Huxley, was also a famous writer. Julian was born intelligent and studied at Eton, then science at Oxford, specializing in zoology. He has written extensively, with thirty published works. Besides science, he is also well-versed in philosophy, poetry, and literature, showing the style of his grandfather. He taught at Oxford and King's College London, and served as director of the London Zoo for many years. He is a member of the Royal Society (F.R.S.). His brother, Aldous Huxley, is a famous writer who has written extensively. His early novels were widely read, and in recent years he has delved into the study of Indian mysticism. He is a progressive thinker in England and currently resides in California, USA. The Huxley family is a refined, unconventional, and romantic family, one of England's famous intellectual families. Now that Julian has been honored with this position, his ambitions will develop. There is high hope for the advancement of world cultural, educational, and scientific endeavors.</p>
<h3 id="e126">METHOD OF MANUFACTURING CALCIUM CARBIDE <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>In a previous article in this publication (Issue 28), I discussed the properties and uses of calcium carbide. Due to space limitations, I did not cover the manufacturing method. I am now writing what I know in response to reader inquiries, hoping to obtain corrections from experts.</p>
<p>In the past, the only method for manufacturing calcium carbide was the electric furnace method. However, due to the increasing applications of calcium carbide, scientists have continuously researched and improved the process. The 1934 edition of "Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry" already mentions the direct method. I will introduce these two methods separately below:</p>
<p>Electric Furnace Method Invented in the 19th century, its raw materials are quicklime and carbon (or coal), which are strongly heated in an electric furnace. The chemical reaction is as follows: CaO + 3C = CaC2 + CO</p>
<p>To produce calcium carbide using this method, the raw materials must be very pure and must not contain elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, and magnesium. Otherwise, a small amount of calcium phosphate present in the lime will cause the product to contain calcium phosphide impurities, which will produce the foul odor of phosphine when it comes into contact with water. A small amount of sulfur will also produce hydrogen sulfide with a "century egg"-like odor. Even trace amounts of magnesium will affect the yield of calcium carbide and consume a large amount of electrical energy. Even adding fluorite ore to counteract this series of reactions is rarely effective. In addition, the moisture contained in the coal and the hydroxide in the lime must be completely removed; otherwise, the production volume will decrease significantly. Therefore, the coal used for manufacturing calcium carbide in ordinary industry must first be heated at a low temperature in a rotary dryer. Also, if limestone (CaCO3) is used as a raw material, it must first be treated at high temperatures to remove carbon dioxide before it can be used. (The heat required for the preparation department can be obtained from the carbon monoxide gas generated during the production of calcium carbide.)</p>
<p>To ensure that the reaction occurs quickly and evenly, the raw materials can first be crushed into fine particles, and then the proportional weight is calculated according to the equation and weighed for mixing. Approximately one hundred parts by weight of lime and sixty-five parts by weight of carbon are sufficient. (Note: Kingzett's Chemical Encyclopedia states that one hundred parts of quicklime and seventy parts of anthracite coal are used. If one ton of quicklime is used, one ton of calcium carbide can be produced. Riegel's Industrial Chemistry states that six parts of lime and four parts of coke are used.) According to the results of actual work, four tons of raw materials are required to produce one ton of calcium carbide.</p>
<p>As for the types of electric furnaces, they can be roughly divided into intermittent and continuous types. The early electric furnaces were designed with the calcium carbide solidifying in an iron crucible at the bottom of the furnace. This is the so-called ingot furnace. The circuit is formed by the carbon and iron at the bottom as one end and the vertically suspended carbon rod in the crucible as the other end. When the current is first turned on, an arc is generated between the two ends, and then the pre-prepared raw material mixture is poured in. The materials then begin to react, creating a calcium carbide pool whose concentration gradually increases until the entire furnace is filled with liquid calcium carbide (Note: The original text's description of the degree of calcination is extremely vague). According to Riegel's Industrial Chemistry, the electric furnace is designed with a tap hole at the top so that the molten calcium carbide can flow out at any time. Therefore, the volume of this type of calcination furnace must be extremely large and made of refractory bricks. The liquid calcium carbide is then allowed to flow into a cooling system to solidify into blocks. The calcium carbide produced by this method has a purity of only 83%, with 14% unreacted lime, 1% unreacted carbon, and 2% other impurities.</p>
<p>The temperature for electric furnace calcination is roughly between 2,000 and 3,000 degrees Celsius. From a scientific and economic standpoint, there is no other source of heat that can be used besides electricity.</p>
<p>Direct Method This method involves directly heating metallic calcium and coal in an iron crucible under an argon atmosphere to 1,225 degrees Celsius. This reaction does not have a significant effect below the melting point of metallic calcium—810 degrees Celsius. However, the calcium carbide produced by this method can be as pure as 93%, but it still inevitably has a black color from the iron.</p>

<h3 id="e128">BE CAREFUL OF ELECTRIC SHOCK! <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— You Ding</p>
<p>You must know that there is nothing strange about electric shock. When the human body becomes part of an electrical circuit, just like when you turn on a switch and see light, the result is predictable. Whether or not an electric shock is frightening, voltage is only one factor. Other factors include the nature of the current (AC or DC; if AC, what is its frequency), how it passes through the body, the condition of the body, skin resistance, the magnitude of the current, and the duration of the exposure.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only current kills. As for voltage, it is only the main factor when the voltage is high and a huge current is delivered. Sometimes very small currents can be fatal. According to a report by a line inspection engineer named Alfred W. Barber, an alternating current with a frequency of 60 and a voltage of 115 volts and 0.075 amperes (seventy-five thousandths of an ampere) can be regarded as the dividing line between safety and danger. But some people underestimate it to fifty thousandths of an ampere. If the duration of exposure is too long, the situation will be different. A current of only eight thousandths of an ampere can cause extreme discomfort.</p>
<p>The most dangerous is alternating current with a frequency of 50 to 150 hertz; direct current is generally less dangerous than alternating current. The magnitude of the alternating current that the human body can tolerate increases with the increase in its frequency. For example, for an alternating current with a frequency of millions of hertz, the human body can safely withstand three thousandths of an ampere.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the human body is not a very good conductor. If a person's left and right hands are in contact with a power source, the human body can be regarded as a series connection of three different resistances. The internal resistance of the human body is R1, which is relatively small, approximately between one thousand and five thousand ohms. The second is the skin resistance R2 at the point where the human body is in contact with the power source, and its value varies greatly depending on the situation. For example, if you lightly brush over the connector with a dry left hand, the skin resistance can be as high as 250,000 ohms; but conversely, if you firmly grasp a wet outlet with your right hand, the skin resistance can drop to 2,500 ohms.</p>
<p>What enables us to coexist with electricity is skin resistance. Of course, we should take good care of it, because without it, we would almost be gone. Factors that affect resistance include humidity, pressure, contact area, and the duration of the current exposure. Among these, humidity is the most important. Whether the weather is dry or humid is often the main reason why electric shock is dangerous. A slightly sweaty hand can also greatly reduce skin resistance. In addition, when current is flowing, the resistance tends to lose its effectiveness, so the longer the current flows, the more dangerous it becomes.</p>
<h3 id="e129">ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERIES IN SCIENCE <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zhusheng</p>
<p>Scientific discoveries often require arduous efforts to succeed. For example, the discovery of "radium" required Madame Curie to extract slight amounts of "radium salts" from tons of pitchblende through multiple refinements, and even more arduous work to discover metallic radium. However, there are also cases where serendipitous opportunities lead to novel discoveries that are readily available. I will cite several examples to illustrate this point:</p>
<p>1. Discovery of Hard Rubber</p>
<p>"Raw rubber" is soft and elastic, making it unsuitable for use. However, when vulcanized with sulfur to form "hard rubber," it is well-suited for manufacturing buttons, penholders, electrical appliances, and other applications. The discovery of the rubber vulcanization method was accidental. One day, a woman named Goodyear was working in the kitchen when she inadvertently dropped a mixture of rubber and sulfur onto a lit stove. She discovered that the soft, sticky raw rubber suddenly became hard and durable rubber.</p>
<p>2. Discovery of Synthetic Dyes</p>
<p>Before the mid-19th century, all dyes were mostly derived from plant-based woad and madder. However, since the discovery of "synthetic dyes" (also known as "coal tar dyes") by the Englishman Perkin in 1856, there have been over several thousand types to date, with a wide array of vibrant colors! Young men and women wearing beautiful clothes should be grateful for this accidental discovery made by an eighteen-year-old while enjoying chemical experiments: One evening, while Perkin was studying artificial quinine, he declared failure. Feeling exhausted, he poured all the used medicinal liquid into a glass bottle. In an instant, he discovered a beautiful color with a black precipitate remaining at the bottom of the bottle. With his keen insight, Perkin immediately realized that the "aniline" (also known as "color essence") he was using could be used to make dyes. He began researching, which resulted in "mauve," a purple dye. From this beginning, it has evolved into the prosperous science of dye manufacturing today!</p>
<p>3. Discovery of Electric Current</p>
<p>—In today's world of advanced electrical technology, the application of electric current is extremely widespread and important! However, the process of its discovery is very interesting: An Italian doctor named Galvani was killing frogs because his wife was sick. His wife accidentally touched the tip of a knife to the nerves on the leg of a freshly killed frog, and the frog's leg suddenly underwent a violent convulsion. Motivated by this, Galvani conducted many experiments to study this strange phenomenon, which he named "animal electricity." In fact, this was the initial discovery of "electric current." Later, through Volta's painstaking research, the battery was invented.</p>
<p>4. Discovery of Oxygen</p>
<p>—Oxygen, which is indispensable for combustion and respiration, was not discovered until August 1, 1774, by the Englishman Priestley. Priestley obtained a large lens with a diameter of twelve inches and focused sunlight on "mercuric oxide" (commonly known as "Three Immortals Pill"), which released a gas. Placing a candle in this gas caused it to shine brightly, which surprised Priestley. This is how "oxygen" was discovered. Not only do historians believe that Priestley did not have any thorough plan beforehand, but Priestley himself also admitted that his discovery of oxygen was mostly due to accidental opportunity.</p>
<p>5. Discovery of Gelatin</p>
<p>—"Nitroglycerin" is prone to explosion during processing and transportation, causing disasters. After the Swedish Nobel discovered that "dynamite" could be made by absorbing nitroglycerin with "diatomaceous earth," its stability increased greatly, but it was not yet perfect. While Nobel was looking for a substitute, he encountered an accidental encounter: One day, Nobel cut his finger, so he took "collodion" to apply to the wound to form an artificial protective skin. The remaining collodion was poured into nitroglycerin, which formed a slurry substance. From this, he discovered "blasting gelatin," whose stability increased dramatically. The world-famous Nobel Prize was created as a result.</p>
<p>6. Multiple Discoveries in the Process of Manufacturing Artificial Indigo</p>
<p>—To manufacture "indigo," "naphthalene," commonly known as "tar oil," should be added to concentrated hot sulfuric acid to form "phthalic acid," but the reaction is slow. Fortunately, an unintentional discovery was made: In the process, a thermometer was used to measure the temperature, and inadvertently, the tube broke and mercury flowed out, and it was immediately found that the speed of producing "phthalic acid" greatly increased. From this, it was known that mercury could be used as a catalyst, and indigo could be manufactured in large quantities.</p>
<p>7. Discovery of Phosphorus</p>
<p>—The German alchemist Brandt once buried himself in experiments, hoping to transform silver into gold using the "Philosopher's Stone." He accidentally obtained "yellow phosphorus" by mixing sand in urine residue and heating it.</p>
<p>8. Interesting Story of the Discovery of the Element Bromine—The German Liebig accidentally produced a liquid that was similar in properties to "iodine chloride." Without thinking, he affixed an iodine chloride (ICl) label to the bottle. Soon after, the Frenchman Balard discovered a new element, "bromine," which was exactly the same as his so-called iodine chloride that he had been inseparable from. In his remorse, he had to admit that the preconceived notion of "first come, first served" caused him to miss out on a major discovery!</p>
<p>There are many historical facts about accidental discoveries in science that cannot be recorded in detail. When an opportunity arises, we should seize it and continue to work hard. To say that a good opportunity is to be expected is no different from waiting for a rabbit to run into a tree stump, and you will feel the same disappointment!</p>

<h3 id="e130">ON RELEASING HATE <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Since the beginning of life in our world, it has been a history of bloodshed. Darwin's theory of evolution clearly proves that the history of all living things proceeds in competition. The survival of the fittest is almost the truth of all living things. This is true of birds, beasts, insects, and humans. Even in the plant world, it is impossible to escape this theorem. It's just that the survival competition of plants is more hidden and not easy to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the theory of survival competition probably do not believe in the religious theory that God created the world with a benevolent heart. Because if there really is such a God, he must be an incomparably cruel tyrant. Because if he still had a few points of compassion, he would never have allowed this world to have a mantis followed by an oriole, a mouse followed by a cat... The natural world that has been admired by poets throughout the ages is actually a demon's cave dressed in splendor.</p>
<p>However, the Genesis theory is just a fantasy fabricated by human beings themselves. The natural world has no such thing as compassion or cruelty, beauty or ugliness, because the natural world has no ideals, and thus no likes or dislikes. All living animals other than human beings belong to the natural world. The iron law of survival of the fittest is only true in the natural world.</p>
<p>Humans, in their primitive stage of survival, did indeed survive under this iron law for a period of time, because at that time, humans' means of conquering nature were not yet advanced, and they could only make a living in the survival competition of natural laws. Even the wars between primitive tribes already contained social causes, but the main reason was still seeking direct survival competition. There were very few that occurred for political reasons. At that time, there was no such thing as war blackmail, and there was no cold war, hot war, nerve war, or propaganda and incitement, which were purely artificial behaviors. The wars at that time did not conceal their predatory nature, nor did they arise from artificial hatred. There was no such thing as doctrines or justice; it was only for the sake of I want to seize your grassland, you want to seize my water source, and everyone is拼命 to fight for survival.</p>
<p>However, the more civilized humans become, the more advanced their means of conquering nature, and the more fierce and cruel the hatred and struggle between humans become. In the short period of the past forty years, there have been two large-scale massacres, and now a third more terrible massacre seems to be approaching. What is this for? Is it for survival competition? Is it the inevitable fate of the theory of evolution?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that all the large and small wars in various countries from the First World War to the present have nothing to do with the direct survival requirements of human beings. Because since the rise of science, humans have long known that the object of their survival competition should be the natural world rather than human society itself. Every step that humans conquer nature is one more guarantee for their own survival. There is no other way to compete for survival other than this. As for the mutual slaughter in human society, it is not only unrelated to survival competition, but it is actually a suicidal act.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the hatred caused by suspicion and jealousy is the main cause of all modern wars. The so-called imperialist wars or class wars, from the economic character of war, although there is a part of the reason, if it were not triggered by the hatred of suspicion and jealousy, judging from the existing production capacity and rationality of human beings, such wars could be avoided. For example, class hatred is entirely artificial hatred. Struggle and slaughter cannot solve this problem, and they can only deepen the hatred and gap between people, and even destroy human conscience and kindness.</p>
<p>To eliminate hatred between people, reason should be allowed to govern emotions first, and all propaganda that promotes hatred should be stopped. Then there is no reason why any major problem in the world cannot be resolved peacefully. But sadly, we often see a group of people who do not wield knives in their hands, but prefer to shout to kill and incite hatred among people for pleasure. Although these people also claim to be anti-Hitler and anti-fascist, in encouraging war and provoking hatred, they are really descendants of Hitlerism.</p>
<p>Before the warmongers lay down their butcher knives, it is hoped that these people, who are also made of flesh and blood, can first release more reason. Bloody rhetoric and hateful curses can be enjoyable for a while, but they ultimately lose the way of loyalty and anger: not to mention that they are harmful to world peace. Since nature has given us a precious life, why not seek the right way to survive and instead want to incite unwarranted hatred?</p>
<h3 id="e131">Striking and Deceiving <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Nianhong</p>
<p>I don't know why, but the people I used to hate as a child, I now find them not so detestable, and in some cases, even feel a certain fondness towards them.</p>
<p>For example, there was a servant named Afu, a crude and violent man, whom I personally witnessed beating his wife, a gentle and kind woman, with a carrying pole. He drank alcohol, even to excess, but he wouldn't allow his wife to even glance at a mahjong game; otherwise, it would be a carrying pole, fists, or a washing mallet. I remember how his eyes, bloodshot from excessive drinking, terrified me the most in my young heart; and also his pair of fists with bulging blue veins, at the slightest disagreement, it would be "I'll beat you up!"</p>
<p>However, after leaving home for more than a decade and growing up, hearing the news from the countryside that Afu had died brought me much sadness, and I felt that such a person dying so tragically (he died a wandering, poor and sick death) was almost a loss to the world. In my mind now, Afu is no longer a cruel and barbaric man, and the person who makes me feel the deepest pain and abhorrence is a quiet, amiable, and effeminate accountant. Although the image of him in my childhood is not deep, I once heard that he lied to his mother, who was far away in a foreign land, saying that he was unemployed and not sending money.</p>
<p>Striking someone is wrong, but it's much better than deceiving your mother. This isn't a matter of filial piety. If you deceive your wife or son, it's the same. Rather than receiving a letter believing that your son or husband is unable to find a job in a distant place and is wandering and drifting, thus causing anxiety and concern (when in reality, he is preparing to get married or take a concubine), I think it would be better to taste the flavor of the carrying pole, fists, and washing mallet. There are plenty of accountants in the world who deceive their mothers, so Afu can undoubtedly be considered a truly rare and good person.</p>
<p>The harm of opium lies not in its easy addictiveness, nor in its destructive toxins that ruin bones and blood, but in its fragrance. If opium had a nauseating, foul odor, I think its harm would at most be selling it to people who want to commit suicide as a tool for suicide.</p>
<p>A wealthy man who pretends to be a great philanthropist is more despicable than a miser who refuses to part with a single hair. I'd rather like robbers, I like a miser who refuses to part with a single hair, but it's a pity that even robbers and misers are not easy to see these days!</p>
<h3 id="e132">Traitor's Calligraphy <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>I don't know if it's due to the influence or suggestion of physiognomy, but many people judge a person by the way they write. It is said that not only can you see a person's fortune from their calligraphy—poverty, success, and longevity—but you can even determine a person's character and whether their intentions are upright.</p>
<p>Whenever my friends say this, I refute them. Yan Song's calligraphy is vigorous and upright. If that theory held true, then he would be an honest and upright man, and seeing his calligraphy should inspire respect. Recently, I saw an album with a postscript by Jia Sidao, exhibiting such an air of squareness and solidity that it was impossible to find even a trace of his rogueishness playing with crickets in Banxian Hall.</p>
<p>I once collected three types of calligraphy: one was Zheng Xiaoxu's clerical script. Zheng's script is like a scattering of celestial flowers, and although its beauty lies in its softness, it is dignified and solemn, not soft and boneless. Moreover, it seems that his calligraphy embodies the grace of Han clerical script, with hardness in the soft lines. How can it not be considered supremely upright and proper! The second was the calligraphy inscribed by Lee Wan-yong, which is orderly and well-regulated, not only possessing the aura of the imperial court but also a cold, stiff formality, almost revealing a righteous gentleman of the orthodox school. The third was a letter by Wang Jingwei, with flowing and clear calligraphy, and beyond its scholarly air, it seems to possess a touch of uninhibitedness. If one judged people by their writing, he would not only be indifferent to fame and wealth but also extremely noble and pure.</p>
<p>These three men were either a traitor who recognized the enemy as his father and sold the three northeastern provinces (Zheng Xiaoxu, the Prime Minister of the puppet state of Manchukuo), or a traitor who personally brought about the downfall of Korea (the Korean minister Lee Wan-yong, who was later ennobled by Japan), or a large-scale dealer of China's national interests. From the calligraphy of these three, the absurdity of the "theory of calligraphy equaling personality" is more than half proven.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought that in order to make a clear distinction, in order to ensure that every traitor and betrayer of the country who wants to be remembered also stinks for eternity—to show everyone that even a person with great talent and high artistic genius will be scorned by humanity if they cannot cherish their nation, which is also a movement to cultivate integrity. I would very much like to collect the calligraphy of countless traitors of China (and its vassal states) throughout history and hold an exhibition of traitorous calligraphy and paintings. I have already collected Yuan Jinkai's (a minister of the puppet state of Manchukuo) autograph letters, Qin Gui's album, and poetry stationery from Liang Hongzhi, Huang Qiuyue, and Wang Yitang.</p>

<p>— Daoxian</p>
<p>After the American Civil War, a life insurance company wanted to hire General Robert E. Lee as its president, with a salary of tens of thousands of dollars a year. General Lee told the directors of the company that he knew nothing about the life insurance business and was not worth that much money. They replied that they did not need him to do any insurance; they only wanted to use his name.</p>
<p>General Lee replied, "Gentlemen, if my name is so valuable, don't you think I should be particularly careful about its use?"</p>
<p>As a result, he declined the offer and went on to become the president of a very small university, with a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year.</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Su Xiao's Tomb</p>
<p>The old capital was delicate and beautiful, with the breezes of the Six Dynasties. Why isn't Xiling burying heroes? In middle age, I gradually feel pity for Su Xiao. The tomb crumbles in the dust of war, and the tears are red.</p>
<p>Climbing Mount Ciyun</p>
<p>In front of the mountain, the tide strikes the rush sails urgently; behind the mountain, the wind blows and the spring waves rise. Don't say that smoke is easy to release. The birds crying in the rivers and lakes have hungry voices!</p>
<p>Nesting branches divide the dusk with mist and haze, tired feet lean on people, still looking at the mountain. The foolish child on the road hasn't been able to return, and the crows on Mount Ciyun return to their nests.</p>
<p>Hidden flowers and wild grasses are the hair of immortals, purple stones and red mud are ten kinds of elixir. It's difficult for the unlucky to be a investigating official, the heavenly wind blows up and blows back again.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Valuing Swans, Despising Pheasants <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>I have often thought that wealth, nobility, and longevity are rarely combined in one person; wife, wealth, children, and official rank are difficult to have all one desires. Therefore, those who are over thirty years old and not yet married often lament that they have "no home to return to," while those who are married inevitably complain of the "burden of family life." Families with many children would rather have wealth and no children; while those who are wealthy but still lack offspring see that the poor may become rich at any time and that children cannot be had at will, so they inevitably yearn for children.</p>
<p>People mostly prefer to abandon the near and pursue the distant, value what they have heard of and despise what they have seen, and disdain reality while loving the ethereal. Our valuing swans and despising pheasants is because swans are distant and pheasants are near. The Chinese people value American dollars and despise legal tender, also because legal tender is encountered every day, while American dollars are uncommon. Regarding the puppet currency of the occupied areas in the past, which was originally regarded as worthless, its value suddenly increased greatly a few days before it was allowed to be exchanged for legal tender. This is because it was about to retreat from the realm of reality into the realm of illusion.</p>
<p>In fact, today's legal tender is not as worthless as imagined. According to a report from the Central News Agency on the 8th, Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Economic Council, said regarding the use of US aid: "This economic aid averages about 28 million US dollars worth of materials per month, which is worth about 16 trillion legal tender at the current US dollar exchange rate. If all of it can be sold on the market at the market price, it would be worth at least 30 trillion legal tender. Together with the Ministry of Finance's monthly tax revenue of 10 trillion yuan, after deducting monthly expenditures, all legal tender can be recovered in less than three months." Furthermore, according to Chairman Chiang's political report to the National Assembly on the 9th, the total amount of legal tender issued up to the end of March was less than 70 trillion, while the government's gold, silver, foreign exchange, and convertible materials were worth a total of 700 million US dollars, more than triple the amount of legal tender, and the recent US loans of over 400 million US dollars to China have not yet been calculated. Based on these two statements, the inflation in our country is not as severe as generally imagined, so why should the Chinese people value American dollars like swans and despise legal tender like pheasants?</p>

<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Listening clearly is a kind of wealth. Those who manage it well become rich from it; otherwise, not only can they not make money, they may even lose money or go bankrupt.</p>
<p>There are only two things in the world that get better with age: wine and friendship.</p>
<p>If you lose one glove, the one that remains seems like it should be even more precious. However, in reality, that one becomes superfluous.</p>
<p>After the wind and rain, some flowers wither; others, however, bloom even more luxuriantly and beautifully.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the most beautiful, tomorrow will be the kindest, and today is the most real. So life is indeed lovely.</p>
<p>Life is a painting, a painting that you paint yourself. It should have color, spirit, and you should be careful and meticulous. Confused children, don't lightly hand over the paintbrush you use for painting to others.</p>
<p>There are only two things in the world that can be renewed over time: love and hate.</p>
<p>Familiarity and fire both cause life to burn and turn into a pile of ashes.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Carefree Flower <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Carefree on the Sea 230</p>
<p>Seeing that someone was injured, the soldiers in the truck jumped out of the vehicle to check. They saw Zhu Zhai lying on the ground, covered in blood, and already unconscious. At that moment, the local police arrived and ordered the truck to take the injured person to the nearby Chunming Hospital for treatment. The hospital examination revealed that Zhu Zhai had suffered a severe head injury. While treating him, they checked his ID card, which showed that he was a bank employee, and also saw the letter from Fei Xiaobo on his person. They quickly notified them separately. Xiaobo had just returned home when he received the call and was greatly shocked. He quickly took a car to the hospital. At this time, Zhu Qi had been treated by the hospital, and several injections of cardiac stimulants had been administered. Although he had regained consciousness, he was on the verge of death. According to the hospital doctor's report, the concussion was extremely severe and very dangerous, and it was feared that he would not be able to be saved. Xiaobo rushed to the sickroom and saw Zhu Zhai lying on the bed, his hands, feet, and head all wrapped in bandages. Seeing Xiaobo enter, he opened his weak eyes and said, "Uncle, it's great that you came. My spirit seems to be unable to hold on. I have a few words to tell you. My injuries won't last. Don't let my father know about this unfortunate news, and even more so, don't let Qiwan know in the future. I'm very sorry to them, very sorry..." As he said this, his voice grew weaker, and only his lips could be seen trembling, unable to utter any sound. The nurse standing beside him said, "He was just supported by the cardiac stimulant injection. If there is anything else to say, another injection can be given." Xiaobo looked at him, feeling very sad, and shook his head, saying, "His family doesn't know yet. I'll wait until I've notified them." As he said this, he saw that Zhu Zhai's eyes were already closed. Xiaobo covered his face and walked out with tears in his eyes. He quickly opened up Yu Ru and Feng Sheng's address and sent people to deliver the letters separately. After about half an hour, when Yu Ru and his wife arrived, they were too late. Zhu Qi had already breathed his last. Yu Ru and his wife cried bitterly. Xiaobo told them about the situation when he met Zhu Qi in the morning, as well as Zhu Zhai's last words. Yu Ru said in tears, "He said he's sorry to me, but in reality, I'm very sorry to him. If it wasn't for my own selfish ideas and prejudices, going to Qiwan's house and telling her my grievances, Qiwan wouldn't have broken off her friendship with Zhu Zhai midway, and the two of them wouldn't have left. Maybe today's tragedy wouldn't have happened. Because of my personal opinion, Qiwan has suffered a lot of hardship and flown far away. Zhu Zhai's outcome is still death. I'm very heartbroken and regretful! Looking at Qiwan's letter, she is an extremely sentimental person. If I tell her the news of Zhu Zhai's death, she will definitely be extremely heartbroken. I can't hurt her any further. I want to follow Zhu Qi's words and hide it from her forever, so that she can have some carefree years at sea." Xiaobo listened, silently, feeling that Yu Ru's words seemed reasonable and unreasonable, and he couldn't judge.</p>
<p>The End of Carefree Flower</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The National Assembly of the capital is a grand ceremony. The assembled heroes and the flourishing and handsome figures on the conference grounds are enough to make even those from remote and barren lands dance with excitement. The "Flowers of the National Assembly" are repeatedly mentioned in various northern and southern newspapers. This is also a common sight in a grand assembly. There are flowers in the city and flowers in the school, and this Western trend has not started today. However, the World Daily's special telegram from the old capital on the 8th said: "Several representatives talked about the backgrounds of the Flowers of the National Assembly, and many were worthy of song and tears. One representative could not help but sigh and recite: 'Since ancient times, beautiful women have often had ill-fated lives.'" Then the history of this flower must be even more special. I don't know what is worthy of song and tears, nor do I know what is meant by ill-fated, but this makes me think of Consort Zhen of the late Qing dynasty, the most ill-fated beauty among the banners, who fell out of favor with the Empress Dowager Cixi. In the year of Jiawu, she was demoted, and during the Gengzi Incident, when the Emperor and Empress fled west, she was ordered to be pushed into a well by the eunuchs. Wang Hanlin (Yan Quan) has a long "Song of the Palace Well," a narrative poem imitating the "Song of Everlasting Regret." The two lines, "Beauty has always been related to fate, yellow furnaces equally cover up favor and hatred," especially sweep away everything and can be called a poetic history. Earlier, in the fifteenth year of Guangxu, the Empress Dowager, considering that the Emperor had reached marriageable age, in addition to selecting Empress Yehenala (the Empress Dowager's niece), also needed to select two concubines at the same time. Therefore, she decreed that "the fifteen-year-old daughter of Vice Minister Changxu, Tatarala, be titled Concubine Jin, and the thirteen-year-old daughter of Tatarala, be titled Concubine Zhen." The poem about palace women says, "In the jade hall of the Emperor's house in those years, palace locusts lined the road, the sound of light carriages. I remember taking the Zhaoyang sisters from the general's residence in Qili." The selection rules only initially titled them "concubines," and later they were promoted to "consorts." Jin was older and very afraid of the Empress Dowager, and dared not show her talent, fortunately, nothing happened. Zhen was quick-witted and capable, and trusted by the Emperor, so she suffered a tragic end. This is one of the most tragic and beautiful pages in the history of the Qing Palace. By the winter of Wushen, both the Empress Dowager and Guangxu had passed away. In the autumn of Xinhai, the Wuchang revolutionary army rose up, and the Qing Dynasty came to an end. The "Song of the Palace Well" ends with four lines: "Heaven leaves old eyes to see the demise, the children's country is just a dream. Only the weeping waters of the imperial moat remain, year after year regretting the vicissitudes of life." Since the Republic of China, many banner people have changed their surnames to Han surnames. Some have taken the meaning, such as "Aisin Gioro," which has the same meaning as "gold," so the "yellow belts" and "red belts" (members of the imperial family and distant relatives) of the previous generation mostly had the surname "Jin." Others have taken the "sound," such as "Guwalgiya," taking the first sound "Gua" and changing it to "Guan," while the first sound "Ta" of "Tatarala" is changed to "Tang." In the past, Madam Tang, the sister-in-law of Puyi, was praised for her calligraphy, and the Times of Books and Paintings repeatedly published her handwriting. According to people in the old capital, she was also a member of Consort Zhen's clan. And many female students with the surname "Tang" in school registers, but who are from the banner, are those who have changed their Han surname from "Tatarala," encountered in the common market, about nine out of ten.</p>
