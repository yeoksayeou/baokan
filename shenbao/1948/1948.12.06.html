<h3>蘇皖豫邊區佈下鐵綱　國軍昨晨進入固鎭　匪向西北逃竄難越雷氾</h3>
<p>〔本報蚱埠五日電〕此間正面國軍，對頑抗於懈河與北淝河間之匪第六縱隊殘部加緊攻擊後，國軍圍擊態勢業已完成，原自臨淮關沿津浦路東側北擊之右翼，於攻克九灣集·仁和集？園宅集等地，進抵澮河南岸後，在蚌埠正面鐵路東側已無匪主力存在。該部復自王莊（在新橋站東）附近迂迴西擊，已與中路沿鐵路北上部隊取得呼應，對鐵路西側併力逼擊；西綫各路大軍仍以原來態勢在淝河北岸繼續攻擊，老曹老集今仍有激戰，頑匪憑藉堅强工事，每一碉堡均爲雙方爭奪之目標，刻該據點已由國軍控制一半。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕軍息：宿固地區之陳毅匪部，在國軍壓迫下，連日紛向豫東永城方面逃竄，企圖重返魯境老巢，國軍正沿隴海綫迄黃泛區布下鐵綱，堵擊捕捉。自三日晚迄五日晨，蘇·豫·皖邊三角地區激戰甚烈，匪東奔西突，無法偷越雷氾一步·北上國軍在空軍掩護下，四日夜迄五日晨，冒雨對盤踞固鎭之陳毅匪部續於犯攻，匪不支倉皇可向西北方潰逃，國軍五日晨已進入固鎮。同時沿津浦綫越夾溝南下之國軍，擊破匪頑强抵抗後，今已迫近符離集，該地匪勢已呈不支。</p>
<h3>匪傾黃河以南全部兵力　國軍獲殲匪良機　徐剿總秘書長分析戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠五日電〕徐州剿總秘書長劉子淸，今在蚌首次招待記者，並解釋當前戰局如下：蚌宿會戰，刻以宿縣爲電心，向國軍有利方面發展中。我黃維正兵團，在漕河南岸宿縣南偏西約五十華里之處，以雙堆爲核心之縱橫十餘華里之陣地中，吸引匪劉伯承，陳賡等部主力，進行血戰，幾已一旬，在該兵團陣地之前，斃匪已不下三萬。該兵團係以胡璉將軍所部之勁旅某軍爲基幹，在華中戰區向爲劉匪勁敵·匪爲挽回其頹勢，復將原在徐州東棧及東南綫尙未整理完畢之陳毅殘部調至宿縣北西西北面一綫及蚌埠正面，以遏阻我南北兵團之夾擊。參加此一戰塲作戰之匪，事實上己傾其黃河以南所有兵力。國軍爲緊握此殲滅匪軍主力良機起見，故以斷然處置，放棄徐州，以增强南下兵團之力量。刻南下之卅萬大軍，在杜聿明將軍指揮下，計分三路前進，中路已過睢漢口，東路向符離集進迫，西路則分兵兩路，進抵永城睢溪口中間地區，以一字形態勢，排除陳匪之阻抗，節節南逼，蚱埠正面之李·劉兩兵團，自七天以前轉守爲次，在敵前强渡淝河後，刻以蚌埠爲基地，北沿津浦路，西沿淝河北岸，向西北方布就爲歸形陣地，對匪六縱隊展開殲滅性之攻擊，匪已呈頹勢。劉氏於敘述蚱埠正面戰况時謂：當面國軍自劉總司令來蚌坐鎭後，在指揮上頃已更形靈活，目前進展如能擊潰頑抗之匪，按計劃北進，目爲最理想之效果，否則能殲滅匪六縱隊全部，在戰果上對匪亦係甚大打擊。劉氏並稱；守江必先固淮，故此次會戰中，國軍以優勢軍力機動戰略殲滅匪軍主力，國軍之勝利當有最大把握。劉氏對今後戰局之展望，認爲蚌宿會戰勝利後，繼而規復徐州易如反掌，卽鄭汴亦可垂手而得。劉氏於談話中表示，當前戰事爲關係民族國家存亡絕續之戰事，渠復一再强調國軍之必可獲勝。渠旋謂：鄧文儀局長本月三日曾稱五日內必有捷音，渠出此語，實有相當把握。</p>
<p>〔本報蚱埠五日電〕軍息：據空軍報吿，自徐南下之兵團配備萬全，部隊後背亦無匪之追擊，其安全無可顧慮。</p>

<h3>蔣夫人呼籲援華　方案由顧大使向美提出　請贊助我反共戰爭速運用物資　確立軍經三年計劃每年助十億元</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕蔣夫人正向美呼籲請援救中國脫離共產主義，以三年爲期，需費三十億元。此方案係由中國高級官員提出作爲援華談判之基礎。方案中列舉四項辦法，已由顧維鈞大使向杜魯門總統面提，蔣夫人亦本此原則向美呼細，且曾兩度與國務卿馬歇爾談及，下星期初將再與杜魯門總統面談。</p>
<p>據熟悉內幕者稱，夫人將着重下列二事：（一）美國對中國處境須有更大之諒解，（二）中國方面相信，在此挽救大局尚未嫌遲，（三）中國政府認為，中國不僅為自己作戰，亦兼為美國及其他反共國家作戰。蔣夫人對於美國如何援助之細則，並不十分注意，僅欲使美國依照中國所提方案中之下列四項辦法行事，卽（一）立即宣而美國贊助蔣總統之反共戰爭，以鼓舞軍心。（二）在美國新國會通過援助法案之前，加還運輸軍用物資。據國務院報吿，軍事援華方案中之一億二千五百萬元，除尙餘約十萬元外，均已用去。中國高級官員則謂，此款雖用以購買物炎，但實際已運交中國者僅約二千五百萬元。（三）派遺聲望素著之將領至中國，主特國軍供應事宜，擴大軍事訓練，並指導戰略。中國希望派麥帥至華，惟杜魯門總統不允。（四）確立軍事經濟援華三年計劃，每年資助十億元，包括軍事代表團經費在內。據顧維鈞大使佔計，第一年之十億元，以百分之六十作軍事援助，百分之四十作經濟援助。嗣後隨軍事局勢之進展，卽可以大部份用於經濟方面。</p>
<p>顧氏曾吿杜魯門總統及國務院人員稱，中國政府認爲依此方案，在三年內可以完成任務。就一般言，美國官方尙不願加以接受。據軍事方面估計，欲拯救中國脫離共產黨，在三四年中至少需費五十億元。社魯門。馬歇爾及其顧問人員至少亦已暫時決定，在中國目前局勢之下，任何援助計劃，欲求有效，實際上將由美國代負責任，杜·馬兩氏均未願意出此，兩氏所最爲關切者，深恐美國被牽入一種局勢，由於中國之混亂解體，消耗美國金錢，漫無止境。</p>
<p>〔發國新聞社華盛頓五日電〕蔣夫人本擬四日發表一正式聲明，但中國大使館宣布，該項聲明已延期至下數日內始能發表。</p>

<h3>任何華北中共政府　美國決不予承認　史潑魯恩斯促勿旁觀中國戰事</h3>

<h3>動盪不穏的日本政局</h3>
<p>日本第四屆議會於二日在參議院揭幕。這次通常議會舉行於政局動盪之際，其演變與發展，關係吉田內閣的命運至大。本屆議會揭幕之日，日皇裕仁出席向兩院議員發表訓詞，裕仁除贊美新憲法的民主精神以外，并籲請議會會員努力使議會成爲「國家之最高權利機關」，并加倍努力，獲得議會對此一「民主及文化之邦」感到深切的認識。裕仁致詞兩日後，首相吉田於四日出席議會，便宣稱本月中旬後即解散眾議院。他說：「日本需要早日簽訂和約，以期達成獨立，苟日本無一眞正之民主政府，則和約不可期望。「吉田復稱：「新憲制定後第一次選舉以來之一年半期間，乃政治上之不穩定時期。」這很顯然地說明了吉田解散議會是具有決心的，本屆議會可能是第一次總選後最後一屆集會了。</p>
<p>第二次吉田內閣正式成立於十月十九日。吉田組閣前經過艱苦作戰，打退了蘆田·三木以及民自黨內一部分元老的「三崎運動」陰謀，獲得出任二度首相後，又力排在野黨的反對，盟總的泠淡，終於在臨時國會取得了相當的勝利，完成了公務員法案的修正。吉田是個性情頑强的人，他代表官僚資本家及地主富農的利益，他所醉心的議會主義，是資產階級的民主政治；他以極濃厚的保守派立塲，抗拒着左派與中間派的政黨，因此他對現階段的中間性議會，完全持一種厭棄的熊度。片山蘆田組閣時，民自黨不參加政府，在野力主解散議會，重新舉行總選。十月十四日吉田當選首相時，僅有一八五票的支持，空白票佔有二一三票。多數的空白票乃是一種力量，無異表示對吉田的不信任。吉田登任後耿耿在心的，便是這二一三空白票代表的反對力量，隨時威脅着政府，尤其是本屆議會討論預算追加案和新薪給標準，議會有迫使政府倒台的可能，因此吉田便以解散議會爲恫嚇，冀藉以解散議會誘致反對黨的屈服。如果議會的反對黨（社會黨民主黨協同黨等），對政府的追加案或新薪給標準案予以障碍，則吉田引用憲法第七條解散議會，重新舉行總選舉，是萬分可能的。</p>
<p>日本新憲法賦予議會審查通過預算的權力，而這一主宰又操在眾院社會黨之手。片山蘆田兩屆內閣預算案和增稅案的順利通過，是獲得形勢上的利便，恰恰相反的，片山蘆田的利便却爲吉田的難關。吉田內閣登任於財政萬分窘困之狀，如要維持今後半年多的支出平衡，祇有仰給追加預算之一途。尤其是公務員薪給基準的調整，所佔支出數字甚大，是必需要追加預算，否則吉田內閣便不能維持·公務員薪給基準，半年前爲三千七百圓，社會黨提出調整爲六千二百圓到七千圓，勞工方面則要求一萬圓，十一月廿日政府公務員三萬五千人的二度遊行示戚，要求實施七千三百圓的新基準，這與政府追加預算案所列的數字，相距懸殊·蘆田內閣時，大藏省打算調整爲五千圓左右，這次吉田內閣提交議會的追加預算案，規定以五千三百圓爲基準，加上臨時補助津貼等，共約五千五百餘圓，倘若再要增加，便將損及資本家地主的利益，吉田是不願如此作的。無疑的，公務員勞工是同情議會反對黨，而反對黨正可以利用民意對抗政府，增加吉田內閣的困難。這一對立形勢的發展，若非政府解散議會，政府將被迫辭職，社會民主協同三黨的聯合陣綫，又將捲土重來。</p>
<p>總之，吉田內閣已面臨難關，吉田如何渡過「政治上的不穩時期」，當看吉田的手腕了。我們必須指出：日本政治的不穩與動盪，並不等於民主政治的發展，現階段的日本政治，距離民主化的進程還很遼遠，即使本屆議會解散後重新總選，眞正的民主力量也未必耶能抬頭，裕仁吉田一派的民主美調，祗可當作宣傳的口吻而巳；事實上，不能令人感到現階段的日本已成爲「民主及文化之邦」。</p>

<h3>柏林西區市議會選舉　選民投票色踴躍　軍警戒防共產黨搗亂</h3>
<p>〔合眾社柏林五日電〕柏林西區今日舉行市參議會選舉，德人成爭先恐後，列隊投票。據當局宣佈，開始投票後五小時內，投票竣事之合法選民巳超過總數百分之四十。一四五〇選區之正式報告稱，起初三小時內投票者佔總數百分之廿二，而與蘇界接境各區之投票人士「分外眾多」。接近蘇界之法佔區某地幾發生嚴重事件，幸告化大事於小事。緣蘇軍三人手特輕機槍，聞入萊尼根這夫區一投票所，威脅選民，法憲兵奉召趕至，令蘇軍退走，蘇軍乃撤至蘇界內高樂鐵路站。市內某地德靑年百人手提木棍，圖阻某投票所工作，並散發共產宣傳傳單。柏林市英美法三區投票於上午八時開始，德人排成長列鵠候。蘇區內則禁止選舉，共黨並在西方三區抵制普選。西區公共車輛自上午六時至十時停駛，俾在蘇區工作之西區柏林人十五萬人有投票之機會。蘇區各地德籍特別警察數百人巳趕赴柏林蘇區，原因不詳。選舉開始時，德警萬人出動戒備，英美法軍隊亦枕戈待命，彼等分乘吉普，在接界處往來。</p>
<p>由於東西兩方之實力，將在此次投票中獲一解答，故每一票均表示西方民主得一票，而共產主義少一票。合格選民約一百六十八萬三千人，西方佔領當局及反共政黨希望投票者能在百分之七十五至九十，若然，則共黨及蘇聯之威望將大受打擊，而等於西方民主之大捷。</p>

<h3>共產勢力在亞洲</h3>
<p>— 石譯</p>
<p>美國根據了這個政策，允許法國把馬歇爾計劃經費中之三千五百萬美元，移用於印度支那，以期使法國在印度支那重登「佔領者」的大寶。同樣的情形，美國也允許了荷蘭把馬歇爾計劃經費中之五千四百萬元，移用於印尼，以期恢復其舊有的勢力。</p>
<p>把援歐經費這樣地移用於亞洲方面，是美國的大錯，於是亞洲各地也就反對之聲遍起。前印尼共和國總理沙爾，是美國的友人，他這樣說：「我們所希望美國的，是能使弱小的民族獲得自由獨立·和民主。但是實際上美國的政策是支持殖民當局，正與我們的願望相背。所以我們的異議，是不能歸咎於我們的。」</p>
<p>現在共黨在亞洲所展開的運動，乃是不利於美國的·當地共黨的首領，多半是在莫斯科受過訓練的。在遠東的共黨，他們的唯一號，就是土地改革和改善佃農的待遇。</p>
<p>在中國，共黨和中央政府對抗已有二十年的歷史，現在正在逐漸展開其控制地區。</p>
<p>在日本，雖然共黨的活動，受着盟軍的節制，但是却仍是有着他的地位。日本共黨勢力在工會和全國勞工聯誼會和其他獨立聯合組織裏是很强。</p>
<p>在印度支那，共黨的勢力還是在二年之後才培養起來的。他們的首領是一位在莫斯科曾經受過訓練的人物。其他的共黨領導人物也皆在越南軍隊裏任着指揮官的職務。</p>
<p>在暹羅人民對於共黨是鮮有好感，官方希望在冷戰中採取中立的立塲。但是他們在恐怖，在亞洲各地的共黨皆佔優勢的今日，暹羅也許不會平安無事。</p>
<p>在馬來亞，共黨所策動的是趕走經營橡膠園和錫礦的英國人。在五月裘，他們曾擬組織國家主義軍而遭失敗。現在他們正在組織游擊隊，擬製造恐怖事件，暗殺事件和其他的工潮。雖然共黨不能名正言順地組織獨立軍，但是他在馬來亞却有使之不安的能力。</p>
<p>在印尼，共黨勢力正在積極培養中。在印尼共和國組織初期，共黨的勢力還很弱，但是現在的印尼共黨部己有傾覆政府的能力了。由於美國公布支持荷蘭，所以共黨的藉口就是反美。共產黨員在印尼共和國臨時國會中佔有四分之一的席位。</p>
<p>在緬甸，共黨是在地下策動，抵抗剛在一年之前才脫離英國而獨立的社會主義政府。緬甸中部的居民，讀成共黨主義的比較多，參加叛逆的軍隊中，有老兵，前緬甸軍人和軍警。現在的緬甸政府是正以自由分配農田的政策使有利於佃濃，以期逃避赤禍。</p>
<p>在印度，共黨勢力的擴張是受着節制，政府正禁錮着許多共黨首領。但在印度南方諸省中，他們還受着農村大眾的支持，這種潛勢力，也就是未來印度共黨發動軍事變亂的暗示。</p>
<p>總之，在亞洲的冷戰是越戰越熱了。共黨在政治和軍事各方面正在擴張勢力。據一般人觀察，美國在亞洲的冷戰是失敗的，但是他還是蒙在鼓裏，倘不改變政策，養羅貽患，後果將不堪設想。（完）</p>

<p>傷者：劉佑成，額部破裂·王福州，額左角破裂。楊發揮，頭頂部出血。袁智茂，頭部破裂。劉子仲，頭部破裂。裴佩泉，胸部受傷。鄭廣宇，恥骨骨折。沈國財，頭部破裂·劉彥儒，左小腿骨折。徐錦鏞，頭部破裂。</p>

<h3>江亞輪慘劇善後　招商局派船撈屍　遇難者家屬三百餘人隨同前往　寗波同鄕會理監事　今午召開緊急會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局滬甬班輪江亞號三日晚在吳淞口外裏銅沙白龍港附近失事，各情迎誌本報。昨日星期，該局客票課爲江亞輸善後事宜，照常辦公，遇難家屬三百餘人淸晨卽至該局探聽消息，哭泣悲痛，其情甚慘。並要求該局派輸載往出事處尋撈屍體，一時人多言雜，發生紛擾。後該局卽派纔中津返滬之海滬輪，於昨晨十一時許，載三百餘遇難家屬前往出事處，同時並派濟安輸帶報務員數名，以便隨時通報。至下午五時左右，又有少數乘客家屬忽稱在該局警務部室內發現已撈向銀盾·皮貨等件，全部家屬卅餘人一時均醫集往觀，並責詢招商局爲何屍體未見，而物件已撈回運滬？據各乘客家屬表示：招商局前派「秋瑾」輪往口外撈屍，返滬一屍未獲，則此項物件究於何時運來上海，殊表懷疑。渠等並謂皮貨水漬未乾，足證必爲被難乘客之物，至銀盾上鐫有「同春錢莊霞軒先生榮任之喜」字樣，此「霞忓先生」是否亦爲被難乘客之一，各家屬亦要求招商局查明公告。當時因招商局無負責人員在塲，嘈嚷多時，未有結果。</p>
<p>業本報呼籲　決提三要求</p>
<p>晚七時被難乘客家屬推派代表李祖安·吳文龍·朱漢根·任金震四人來本報，聲述出事後渠等全體悲憤心情，呼籲主持正義，並表示決向招商局提出三點要求：（一）四日晚乘客家屬被驅散時，招商局允諾五日（星期日）各部決照常辦公，處理此事，但昨並未實行。招商局應卽日指派專人，與各家屬洽辦善後事宜。（二）由各家屬陪同赴出事地點打撈屍體。招商局應每日切實履行，直至各家屬認可爲止，同時每日打撈情形應分上中下午三次電滬，由招商局公告。（三）此次出事原因，及在屍體未撈獲前已發現遇雛乘客衣服運滬一點，招商局應負責澈查公告。</p>

<h3>公司當局聲明　決全力辦善後</h3>

<p>市長等致詞</p>
<p>繼請吳市長致詞稱：近來上海市民，夭天在講逃避，認爲上海終有不保之一天，此種下意識的判斷，是最要不得的。本人認爲京滬區本無危險可言，而最爲危險的，便是人心上所不應有的恐懼，希望本市工人大家團結起來，才能求得眞正的安定。旋由中央濃工部副部長陸京士致詞，謂今日工界舉行聯席會議的意義，極爲重大，每一工人，對當前局勢，應有深切的認識，與了解，始能解除各人心理上的恐怖，陸氏並建議工界應動員組織反共救國機構，大家努力爲國家民族及個人的前途着想，盡力幹去。</p>

<h3>房客總聨會　舉行座談會　反對無理加租　議決辦法四項</h3>
<p>上海市房客總聯合會，爲反對房地產業主最近無理擅自加租，昨日下午三時假南京西路大觀社舉行房租問題座談會，由姜豪主席，出席該會理監事及本市各區房客聯合會代表張中原·何元明·馬君碩·陳培德·邵永生·盧叔達等百餘人，席間各代表對房地產業主此次無理加租，極表憤慨，決定除雙方同意合理協議者外，對不法新增租金，一致行動，拒絕繳付，熱烈發言歷三小時，最後決議四項具體辦怯如下：（一）呈請市參議會重訂租金最高限額。（二）在新限額未訂定前，過去七千倍九千倍之限額，依法理言仍應有效，如房東扼收，可提存銀行。（三）在新限額未訂定前，如房客願意調整，可與房東協商，至調整最高數字，推定何元明·姜豪·邵永生·張中原·陳培德·馬君碩·盧叔達等七人組織小組委員會，詳細研究擬定，通知各會員一致行動。（四）房租調整時，押租不得追收，並至少以六個月爲一期，期內不再調整。據房客代表盧叔達等報告，房地產業主此次加租，事前曾會同交換意見，決定加租標準，以恢復戰前租額及依八一九租金加二五〇倍至三五〇倍爲兩項原則，但若干食岡暴利更甚之房東，加租遠過此項標準。參議員陳培德卽以房客代表地位，指出渠所住之華格果路八仙坊，戰前月租十八元，「八一九」時爲法幣十三萬五千元，最近接獲之通知，則自九月份起加租為一三五金圓，漲率之高，令人夢想不到。</p>

<h3>塞外貧民敎育福音　艾振華訪問訪</h3>
<p>— 本報記者趙展</p>
<p>〔本報張家口二日航訊〕在張家口獻身於小學教育的艾振華女士，以傳教士的精神教育一羣沒有資格進入學校的貧苦兒意，這種崇高的精神足以與任何時代的偉大教育家媲美，也不讓乞食興學的武訓先生專美於前。</p>
<p>記者在張家口的貧民區訪問了艾振華女士。她的「學校」並不是教育局立案准于成立的，市政府沒有給予任何津貼，她開辦了學校，並計劃擴展，她的努力已得到社會的讚揚，也許人們不知有其他學校，但沒有一個人不知道貧民區的艾振華和她辦理的小學。</p>
<p>住處就是學校</p>
<p>那是在市區邊緣的山坡上的一簇矮小的住房，其中有一間比絞淸潔的，便是艾先生的住處，也就是學校。夏天的時候，學生在院子裏上課，一到冬天，她的臥室便是教室。她有一個十一歲的女兒，聰明活潑，是她的助教（小先生）兼校役。艾先生談到她開辦這所貧民小學的動機說：「本處人民，不識字的居多，生活習愼，大都趨向下流，大部分學齡兒童，被摒棄於學校門外，終日謾駡街頭，嬉戲巷尾，不啻宣示了其前途之無望與恐怖。有的雖不至如此，但在相當年齡，有充役當兵的，走時母子依戀對泣，走後半年或數月，不見一字寄來，母子雙方記掛得很，卻又無從訴說，每見此情此景，感嘆至深，所以憑渠一己的天良，竭盡自己的所能，教育一般無力讀書的貧苦孩子。她們的家長及社會人士都很贊同，給我很大的安慰。」</p>
<p>樹枝鐵釘代筆</p>
<p>關於學校成立的的經過，艾先生說：「我先徵得本甲甲長和學生家長的同意，向熟人借了不足六尺面積的小黑板，買了一盒粉筆，又借了一隻小鐘，召集了隣近的兒童二十餘名，二月初居然能在院子裏開露天學校上課了。他們都是窮苦學生，讀書用具一概沒有，我只好把字寫在黑板上，學生們樹枝或鐵釘及其他硬物代筆，院中的廣塲便是紙或石板。</p>
<p>敎室改造成功</p>
<p>如此的光景，過了四月，夏季來了，烈日當空，兒童們營養不良的身體受不了火燒似的太陽，就在六月初，師生共同努力改造一所教室（如我所見），僱了一個木匠，把一張大桌子改成四張小桌了，便在此簡陋教室中，授之以文字，教之以禮儀。記者看到學生們有禮貌的態度，完全不像在別處所常見的一羣野孩子，十分感動。我想到盧騷說：「小孩子的墮落，大多是因沒有好好訓導的關係」這一句話中所包涵的眞理。</p>
<p>獻身敎育決心</p>
<p>辦這樣一所　樸的學校，決不是一件輕易的工作，沒有堅忍毅力是不成的。艾先生談到她的困難，以及艱困中的希望，她說：「既無正式校舍，便限制了多少有志來求學的孩子。况且這樣辦下去，艱難太多，學校的經費沒有來源，半途而廢，我決不甘心。我個人巳下了決心，獻身於此，正如獻身宗教，盡一己之力，幫助貧苦問胞。我希望這個學校能在熱心人士同情協助之下發展成爲一個規模良好的學校，我是在此目標之下奮勉着。」</p>
<p>孤兒院裏出身</p>
<p>艾振華女士今年四十二歲，滿面縐紋，說明她過去的辛勞。她是綏遠薩拉齊縣人，一歲，母親便吃烟土自殺了，她爲收師鄂必格收養，在孤兒院中畏大的，她曾在教會辦的師範學校畢業，以後便作傳教士，先嫁教區助理趙君，不幸趙君早故，又改嫁了申醫生。日本人投降的那年，他們一家來到張家口。艾女士是牧師撫養，所以他一生獻身宗教，因爲她不幸的身世，她更感恩上帝，極其虔誠的爲貧苦的人們服務。</p>
<p>在荒凉的塞外曠野，艾先生所創辦的學校有眞實的價值，自然，她的學校極需要同情與協助。</p>

<h3>湘西辰谿　水淹煤洞　礦工葬身　五人倖存</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿九日快訊〕湘西辰谿，爲湖南煤礦區之一，雖無大隨模公司開採，然小型民營公司甚多，其中有惠民煤礦公司，開採悉用舊法，最近因設備關係，發生礦洞被淹慘劇，茲誌經過如下：十月十八日下午六時，洞內礦工均放工出洞，惟有小數井工與挖工，爲增加收入，留洞繼續工作，詎料道礦突被水淹滿，迨公司用抽水機念救時，因電力發生故障，於是此批留在洞內之礦工，便活生生埋葬在此黑沉沉之地獄中。直至十一月十七日，公司拚全力將洞內儲水全部抽出，并疏通礦道，當時入洞，除發現死屍七其外，竟尙有五個活人，此五人已經過二十餘日，據告：肖洞被淹後，與外界隔絕，於飢餓萬分時，吃死人的屍體，以茍延殘喘，現因此五人與陽光隔離太久，故不敢栘出洞外，暫仍留住洞中，每日由公司送給米湯度活。</p>

<h3>黔省加緊籌組　貴州物產運銷公司</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟癡</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿六日航訊〕黔省農業生產，年來以當局之積極提倡，及人民之自覺自動，確已收獲極大成效，其中尤以美菸，桐油，菜油，最著成績。關於美菸栽種地區，幾遍全省，年產百數十萬石，以品質優良，暢銷省外。桐油產地，廣表共約二十餘萬畝，每年產油計達十六萬餘石。至菜油一項，向爲本省普遍之冬季作物，年產菜籽二百餘萬担，本年經省府通令各縣增產後，又復派員實地督導，預計來春成績，當更見優良，而桐油，菜油兩者又係出口物資，對建設本省農村，繁榮國民經濟，裨益至爲鉅大。惟黔省對外出口物資，大部必經廣東，廣東方面對於隣省物資過境控制，規定極嚴，如桐油菜油，凡經廣東出口，或在穗求售者，必須讓售百分之六十與半官半商之華南貿易公司，而價格方面，自較市價爲廉，因是黔省商界與農界方面所受損失至爲重大。黔省當局爲提倡農業生產，調劑物資供需，對於如何發達省際貿易，增產出口物資方面，特飭各有關機關切實研討，頃已決定籌組「貴州物產運銷公司」，俾使市塲集中，省府使於督導，並可以應省外國外之大量需要，採辦本省農村不可或缺之重要物資。當經谷正倫主席指定建設廳廳長何輯五，前甘肅省銀行總經理朱邁蒼爲正副籌備主任，已自十五日起正式籌備，擬於年內全部完成，明年一月份卽正式成立。</p>

<p>十一月廿五日早晨七時許，陳家橋河南聯中學生在操塲上訓話後解散，過陳家橋街上，搶吃大餅，與店主發生言語衝突，學生遂羣以刺刀向店主威脅，並搗毀什物，激起鄉民公憤，學生卽向校內逃回，鄉民遂趕至校內與教師理論，在雜亂中損壞校內什物，當時該管張村區胡區長聞悉，卽率隊彈壓，向鄉民勸慰，並由該校祖保懲處肇事學生，賠償大餅店損失，鄉民卽行散去。</p>
<p>一小時後，本鄉尤家祠，老爺殿等處學生，得悉校內損壞物件，憤不可遏紛紛以木棍·三角鐵·刺刀等，（奪下學生持有之三角鐵刺刀等已交首都衛戍司令部無錫指揮所穆科長）蜂踴各處，不問男女老幼，卽加毆打，鄉民不及躱避，遂抵抗而引起互毆。當時將鄉民股金泉·蔡五度·毛施氏等擊成重傷，（現投無錫公醫院診治），輕傷者各有數十人，是時胡區長聞悉，卽時戒嚴，並會同本人及校方安主任，赴出事地點勸告，始行散去，一面將雙方受傷者送往區署，設法醫治，毆打遂告停止。所傳鄉民特槍嗚鑼，學生投河失踪一節，爽非事攻。</p>

<h3>共產主義在中國　一九四八年九月　國眾院外交委員會紡撰</h3>
<p>— 本報編詳空特譯</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>五，所謂「新民主主義」不過是達到政變和獨裁目的的手段而已，正如一九四八年二月表現於捷克國內的情形一樣</p>
<p>六，倘必須成立國民黨和共產黨的聯合內閣，任何一方都有否決權，都可能推翻聯合政府。</p>
<p>七，茍如是則必以全體表決制代替多數表決制——那是有史以來最軟弱的一種政治制度。</p>
<p>八，假如我們不能使容納共產黨的聯合政府在柏林，朝鮮，希臘，或歐洲復興計劃中發生效力，難道我們能要求中國人使它發生效力不成？</p>
<p>九，以自由爲基礎的世界和平還沒有奠定始基，美國的安全問題不能認爲無足輕重的問題。</p>
<p>十，共產黨勢力的擴張足以加强其繼續分化非共產世界的手段和能力。</p>
<p>十一，中國的眞正獨立對於美國的安全是絕對必要的。</p>
<p>十二，如果沒有他國的援助，中國的獨立決不能持久。</p>
<p>十三，中國地域雖大，但是給予它的援助可以比給予歐洲的小得多，而且依然可以發生效力，中國特別需要技術顧問。</p>
<p>每一方面對於對方所提出的理由都有敏捷的答辯。贊成援助中國的，，對於反對者作如下簡單的答復；</p>
<p>我們將面對一個赤化的中國，它將加强共黨企圖支配世界的力量，不但你要覺得驚奇，而且對於我們將是一個重大的損失。」</p>
<p>反對援助中國的，對贊成者的答辯如左：</p>
<p>「你不能保證你的援助能够創造一個自由·民主·强盛的中國，能够自立更生，帮助建立世界和平。」</p>
<p>但贊成援助的人會提出一個最後答復如左：</p>
<p>「我們固然不能保證成功，但是如果沒有援助，中國的迫於眉睫的喪失是必然的。在中國還沒有不可挽回地喪失以前，我們還來得及努力試驗和學習。解決重大的間題是需要相當時間的。放棄整個間題而對共產黨屈服，決不是和平之道，而是走向戰爭之路。假如和平可能實現，不是因爲調和的夢想在今日巳成事實，而是因爲我們能很快的知道怎樣建立一個穩定堅强的非共產世界。我們如果不跑，決不能奪得競走的錦標。我們甚至不能阻止競走的進行，因爲對方在奔走着，和平的錦標放置於跑道的終點，是自由的和平，，或是蘇維埃支配下世界的餘燼中的和平。」</p>
<p>戊美國的調停和援助</p>
<p>大戰結束時，美國受託維持民主國家和蘇維埃國家的調和，和平的希望卽寄託於此。從聯合國的國際合作擴大到四强管制德國，到朝鮮的劃分爲南北二區，以至於和約的簽訂。這調和的希望終於成了泡影。一九四七年三月十二日發表的杜魯門聲明，可認爲美國公然承認共產主義與民主主義間的不調和。此後若十時美國曾繼續努力促使國共調和的夢想成爲事實。</p>
<p>美國於「勝利」開始之初，卽努力協助中國各黨派成立全國團結的協議。毛澤更於一九四五年八月二十六日在赫爾利大使敦促下來到朮慶。十一月間，在中國內戰已經達到嚴重階段以後，赫氏掛冠求去，接着馬歇爾將軍以特使名義被派至中國。一九四五年十二月十五日，杜魯門總統發表美國對華政策的聲明，承認國民政府是全中國的合法政府，但籲請全國團結一致，並聞明美國決不以足以「左右中國內戰之進行」的方式干涉中國事件。</p>
<p>從一九四五年八月到十一月，美國似乎明確地支持着國民政府，蘇聯則表示緘默。蔣介石與毛澤東的談判順利開哈。但赫爾利大使遭受美國左派團體的攻擊，削弱了他對於共產當的威信。</p>
<p>馬歇爾將軍，由於他的莫大的威信和堅强的意志，維持着談判的進行，一直到功虧一簧的地步。一九四六年一月，成立停戰協定；同年春間，國民政府和共產黨準備簽訂將停戰範圍擴大到東北的協定。但在該協定簽字以前，馬歇爾離華返美，致迄未簽字。四月十五日共產黨宣布東北入於戰爭狀態。數天後馬歇爾返華，不斷爲中國國內的和平而努力，一直到一九四七年春間，纔聲明放棄努力，並於一月七日發表了一個聲明，對國共變方都有非議。從那時起美國承認內戰狀態存在於中國，蔣介石則竭力設怯使美國知道他曾盡力避免戰事，但這時戰火已經很慘烈了。一九四七年夏，魏德邁將軍來華調查中國局勢，可是他的報告始終沒有公布。這時，美國終於改變了在中國團結未會實現以前拒絕給予援助的政策，美國國會卒於一九四八年三月通過數額相當鉅大的援華案。</p>
<p>中共在談判中問始終堅持兩個特別的條件。第一，他們堅持自編軍隊，同時成立復員協定的最低條件是：共產黨須有八個師。第二，共產黨應在內閣中佔有若干席次，而以公正的政治協商方式來決定。這無疑是「新民主主義」的方針，也就是大戰以後東歐各國政府所遵循的方針。</p>
<p>美國政府依據一種假定，認爲共產主義和民主主義是可以調和的，毅然以中國調人自居，這種努力實已超過了限度。美國向中國人提出的那種建議，在歷史上實無前例可尋。共產黨企圖利用內閣中席次的意向，己經表現於今日的多數國家。在容納一個意存獨裁的黨派的聯合內閣中，弱小黨派的命運已經明白表現於布爾雪維克革命以後蘇俄的第一任內閣，和墨索里尼及希特勒的第一任內閣。在上述三個內閣中，主宰的黨派以外的其他黨派雖都有黨員參加，但那主宰的黨派是殘忍無情的，結果很容易變成獨裁政治。從這觀點看來，偶爾有人對於美國促進和談的誠意，或對於蔣介石進行和談的誠意表示懷疑，似乎是很奇怪的。美國迎合中共的努力，超出了妥協的程度以外。</p>
<p>美國從事調停的兩年努力，證明了和共產黨合組民主的聯合政府是不可能的一件事，不獨在中國爲然，在世界各國都已得到了證明。很明顯的，「新民主主義」不過是由無產階級握權迅速過渡到無產階級專政的代名詞而已。一九四八年三月，美眾院外交委員會通過給予中國以軍事及經濟援助，此項決議得眾院和參院的支持，制定一九四八年的國外援助怯案，並獲通過。</p>
<p>已中國共產黨的弱點</p>
<p>共黨主義在中國獲有許多重要的優勢，並佔有許多有利環境的便宜。但是中國共產主義也有它的弱點。有幾個弱點有關中共達到獨裁目的的機會。其他的弱點涉及中共得勢以後從事建設的能力，它的一切弱點所引起的後　，並不是它可以被我們所忽視，而是它可能並几必然被我們所擊敗。</p>
<p>近年來反對美國援助中國者，所持見解甚爲奇特。若千作家認爲共產黨不能奪取中國，所以不必去反對它。其他的人則以爲共產黨能够解決中國問題，所以我們不應去反對它。這兩種見解合併而成一種理由，以爲中國能够吞沒它的征服者，像吞服一劑共產主義的補藥一樣。兩種見解的結論是：美國不必憂祖。中共的弱點雖不必使我們忽視它，但是擊敗它巳不是絕對不可能的事了。</p>
<p>中共的第一個顯明的弱點是共產主義不能在都市裏而獲得廣大的黨徒，甚至不能以武力奪佔重要的都市。共產黨的成功差不多完全限於鄉村方面。他們從未長期據有一個較大的城市。然而馬克思主義據說是適宜於工業社會亦卽都市的一種主義。這稱自相矛盾之論有兩大理由第一個理由是內戰狀態的存在，在此種狀態下卽使是一個較弱的部隊也可以據有偏僻的區域而有長期佔領的模樣，但是不能佔有大軍可以達到的城市。第二個理由是城市本身的性質。</p>
<p>中國城市的社會和經濟組織是老的公所（同業公會）和現代的新設施的複雜的混合物。公所是職業的團體，其中份子包括老悶（師傳）·職工（夥計）和學徒，在許多方而類似歐洲中古時代的基爾特（Guild）。又有同鄉會的組織，把原籍在同一城市的人聯合起來。這些團體以保障社會安全爲宗旨增進會員的福利，像美國的共濟會社之類的團體。這種公所和同鄉會制度如果組織强大，可以經辦內地的貨運，不用單據而負保險的責任。一切交易都憑誠實和信用，雖也有營私舞弊，詐欺取巧和重利盤剝的事情，但完全是中國特有的形式。</p>
<p>如此組織的城市，共產黨對之最無辦法。因爲勞工團體具有特殊的形式，不像歐美的產業工會，共產黨沒有什麼可以奪取。同時這種具有高度的忠實和紀律的社會，能以强大的力量回擊，能够閃避域破壞規章，能够削縣官僚政治的利器，不管那官僚政治是國民黨的或是共產黨的。共產黨在遺些城市中並沒有獲得廣大的民眾，因此不能用强力去支配這些城市。</p>
<p>中共第二個弱點是它的「新民主主義」的最近的喪失。以前中共可以推託它的不完全布爾雪維克的戰術是中和政策，而不是有地方政權而無全國政權的產物。這種託詞也就不攻自破了。中國共產主義和內戰範圍的變動，引出許多新的問題和責任，而漸漸暴露了它的獨裁政治的眞面目</p>
<p>這些弱點並不是說共產主義不能在中國獲勝，而是說它祇能靠武力獲勝。以爲倔强的農民可能挫敗共產主義的見解，那依舊是一稱夢想。共產黨知道怎樣去分化反對的階級和團體，知道怎樣用死刑作爲消滅反對的有效方法。</p>
<p>中共最大的弱點在於中國的幾個基本問題，它是無怯解決的。中國不像蘇聯那樣，富有空曠的土地可以容納增加的人口。它不能憑藉移民邊區的方法來解決它的糧食問題。它不能肅淸反對份子而把他們流徙到空曠的地方去。中國不能犧牲目前的幸福以培養未來的戰爭勢力。共產黨一旦奪得政權以後，祇能用集產主義化保持它的權力。換言之，共產黨必須粉碎中國經濟組織的一切現狀，必須粉碎農村組織而實行集產主義化，使內戰蔓延到每一個鄉村，像蘇俄所發生的情形一樣。這種辦法在擁有鉅大人口如中國的國家，是不能實行的。</p>
<p>共產黨祗能襲用蘇聯的方怯，卽犧牲人民的福利以積聚資本的方法，以建立中國的工業。蘇聯除非澈底改變它的軍火經濟，決不能給予他國以經濟援助。美國資本能給予中國以發展國內資本的始基，這不是武力外交，而是提高中國人民的生活水準。</p>
<p>上述中共的種種弱點，並非共產主義不能獲勝或得勢之謂，也不是說：如果共產主義在中國獲勝，卽不能在東南亞獲勝。這些弱點表示：共產主義如果在中國獲勝，人命的損失將不可勝算；同時表示：世人如有充分的技巧和決心，這種損失還有防止的希望，這希望是有若千根據的。</p>
<p>五　中國的重要性</p>
<p>甲　中國在世界戰略中所處的地位</p>
<p>「世界潮流的中心已漸漸移轉到中國。凡了解該老大國家—在社會，政治，經濟和宗教各方面—者，卽能解答今後五百年的政治」。</p>
<p>—美國務卿約翰海（JohnHay）</p>
<p>關於中國之戰略的重要性，有時候就中國海的控制，或就中國各地至各國目標地區的轟炸距離，或就軍事人力的儲藏所各方面加以討論。這些討論的範圍是太狹窄了。</p>
<p>根據目前的種種推測，二十世紀下半期的世界命運可能有如下的發展：在本世紀末可能是蘇維埃的世界；也可能仍舊是非共產主義的世界；也可能巳經發生了一次世界大戰。</p>
<p>世界的未來命運繫於兩大生活制度之間，各以一位權成的創始人爲其代表。我們每每忽略：實際生活於這兩種制度下的人們的總數，祇有六億人，約佔全人類百分之二十八。祇有這一部份人類，我們可以說他們的政治制度是共產主義的或是民主主義的。尙有十五億人對於目前的均勢並無多大影響，他們的政治祇具有民主主義的雛型，他們的經濟情形比較落後，他們的自然力的使用比較不普遍，他們的農業以外的生產力遠在現代西方的水準以下。</p>
<p>這一部份人羣對着面若干一般問題，這些間題的處理方法將決定他們應走的路綫。共產主義提供更簡易的解決方法，工業的進步和强有力的政治組織，但是有意閃避最難解決的人類自由問題。這是比較容易接近的解決方怯，是一種節省勞力和腦力的解決方法。</p>
<p>使十五億人實行民主政治，在經濟方面李有企業的自由而不致威脅共產社會發展的自由，這是可能的。使他們實行共產主義而不致成脅民主社會發展的自由，這是不可能的。作爲共產主義基本的鬥爭學說不容許那樣。共產主義在未曾普及全世界以前，不能容許和平的存在，它利用戰術和策略以削弱和分化一切獨立的制度。這差別在戰略上關係至爲重大，因爲民主主義欲得到成功，較之共產主義需要更多的人羣去帮助它。共產主義的任何鉅大的收穫，使非共產世界更易受經濟，政治和心理戰—冷戰—的攻擊。這給予共產黨以較大的優勢。民主國家如欲避免正規戰爭則不免於慢性戰敗的遭遇，否則將從事正規戰爭以彌補冷戰的損失。</p>
<p>在可以傾向民主主義也可以傾向共產主義的十五億人口中，中國是一個決定性的地區。它的人口幾佔三分之一。中國不是任何一國的殖民地，就這點意義上講，它是一個自由的國家。它可能爲任何一方所侵入，它的國內均勢很容易被任何有勢力的干涉所推翻。它的命運將決定東方半數民族的命運。（未完）</p>

<h3>Laying Down an Iron Net in the Border Area of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan: National Army Entered Guzhen Yesterday; Bandits Fled Northwest, Unable to Cross the Lei and Fan Rivers</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhoubu, 5th] The National Army on the front lines here, after intensifying their attacks on the remnants of the bandit 6th Column resisting between the Xie River and the North Fei River, have completed the encirclement. The right wing, which originally moved north along the east side of the Jinpu Railway from Linhuai Pass, captured Jiuwanji, Renheji, Yuanzhaiji, and other places, advancing to the south bank of the Hui River. There is no longer a main bandit force on the east side of the railway in front of Bengbu. This unit then detoured west from near Wangzhuang (east of the Xinqiao Station) to attack, coordinating with the central route troops advancing north along the railway, jointly pressing the attack on the west side of the railway. The various units of the western front continue to attack on the north bank of the Fei River in their original formations. Fierce fighting continues in Lao Cao and Lao Ji, where stubborn bandits rely on strong fortifications, each bunker being a target of contention for both sides. Currently, the National Army controls half of these strongholds.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Military News: The Chen Yi bandit troops in the Sugu area, under the pressure of the National Army, have been fleeing towards Yongcheng in eastern Henan for days, attempting to return to their old nest in Shandong Province. The National Army is laying down an iron net along the Longhai Railway to the Yellow River flooded area to block and capture them. From the evening of the 3rd to the morning of the 5th, fierce battles raged in the triangular border area of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui. The bandits fled east and west, unable to stealthily cross the Lei and Fan rivers. Under the cover of the Air Force, the National Army moving north continued their attacks on the Chen Yi bandit troops entrenched in Guzhen from the night of the 4th to the morning of the 5th, braving the rain. The bandits, unable to withstand the attacks, fled in a panic towards the northwest. The National Army entered Guzhen on the morning of the 5th. At the same time, the National Army moving south along the Jinpu Railway past Jiagou, after breaking through stubborn bandit resistance, has now approached Fuliji.

<h3>The Bandits傾斜 All Forces South of the Yellow River: The National Army Seizes an Opportunity to Annihilate the Bandits; Secretary-General of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters Analyzes the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 5th] Liu Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, today met with reporters for the first time in Bengbu and explained the current battle situation as follows: The Bengbu-Suxian campaign is currently developing in a way favorable to the National Army, with Suxian as its focal point. Our Huang Wei Corps, on the south bank of the Cao River, about fifty li southwest of Suxian, with Shuangdui as the core of its position spanning more than ten li in all directions, has been engaging in bloody battles with the main forces of the bandit Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, etc., for nearly ten days. Before this corps's position, no less than 30,000 bandits have been killed. This corps is based on a crack unit of General Hu Lian's troops, which has been a strong enemy of the Liu bandits in the Central China theater. In order to reverse their decline, the bandits have also transferred the remnants of the Chen Yi troops, who had not yet been completely reorganized on the eastern and southeastern fronts of Xuzhou, to a line northwest of Suxian and in front of Bengbu, to prevent the encirclement of our northern and southern corps. The bandits participating in this battlefield have in fact倾斜 all their forces south of the Yellow River. In order to seize this good opportunity to annihilate the main force of the bandit army, the National Army made a decisive decision to abandon Xuzhou in order to increase the strength of the southern corps. Currently, the 300,000-strong army moving south, under the command of General Du Yuming, is advancing in three routes: the central route has crossed the Suihankou, the eastern route is pressing towards Fuliji, and the western route is divided into two groups, advancing to the area between Yongcheng and Suixikou, eliminating the resistance of the Chen bandits and pressing south step by step in a single-line formation. The Li and Liu corps on the Bengbu front, after switching from defense to offense seven days ago and forcibly crossing the Fei River in front of the enemy, are now using Bengbu as a base, deploying a semi-circular formation north along the Jinpu Road and west along the north bank of the Fei River, launching an annihilating attack on the bandit 6th Column, which is showing signs of collapse. When describing the battle situation on the Bengbu front, Liu said: Since Commander-in-Chief Liu came to Bengbu to take charge, the command has become more flexible. If the current progress can defeat the stubborn bandits and advance north according to plan, it would be the most ideal result. Otherwise, annihilating the entire bandit 6th Column would also be a great blow to the bandits in terms of battle results. Liu also stated that "to defend the Yangtze, one must first secure the Huai," so in this campaign, the National Army is using its superior military strength and mobile strategy to annihilate the main force of the bandit army. The National Army's victory is very certain. Liu's outlook on the future battle situation is that after the victory of the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, recovering Xuzhou would be as easy as turning one's hand, and even Zhengzhou and Kaifeng could be obtained easily. Liu expressed in his speech that the current war is a war related to the survival of the nation and the country. He repeatedly emphasized that the National Army will definitely win. He then said: Director Deng Wenyi stated on the 3rd of this month that there would be good news within five days. He had considerable confidence in making this statement.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhoubu, 5th] Military News: According to Air Force reports, the corps moving south from Xuzhou is fully equipped, and there are no bandit pursuits on the rear of the troops, so its safety is not a concern.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] The annihilation battle on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou has achieved a great victory after three days and nights of tenacious fighting by the National Army, dispersing the bandit 1st, 6th, and part of the 2nd Columns.

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Most observers in the old capital believe that the Communists will not launch a large-scale invasion in Hebei for the time being, waiting for heavy artillery to be transported from the Northeast.

Some people believe that Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression, is preparing for a decisive battle. If the operations are carried out properly, the Hebei defense line can be held at least until next spring or summer.</p>

Currently, except for the Niutuo and Numo positions in the southeast, which have been slightly eroded by the bandit army, all other positions are in the hands of the National Army. The positions on the west, north, and south sides have even been expanded. About 3,000 bunker fortifications surround Taiyuan City, extending ten li deep. Within the city, sixty to seventy percent are still being firmly defended. Except for the Wusu Airport, which was abandoned due to its distance, there are still six airports available for use. Some of these were completed by mobilizing civilian labor in a few days. They can fly 200 times a day, and there is absolutely no problem with importing manpower or materials by air. The bandit army surrounding Taiyuan has exhausted its strength. If the defending army receives sufficient external aid in the short term, it will be able to crush the enemy's offensive."</p>

<p>[Our News] Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng came to Shanghai from Nanjing together yesterday and visited President Sun at the Casting Hospital. They talked for a long time. It is believed that it is related to the preparations for forming a cabinet.</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Calls for Aid to China: The Plan is Submitted to the US by Ambassador Gu; Please Sponsor Our Anti-Communist War, Expedite the Use of Materials, Establish a Military and Economic Three-Year Plan, and Help 1 Billion Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek is calling on the US to rescue China from Communism for a period of three years, costing three billion yuan. This plan was proposed by senior Chinese officials as the basis for aid negotiations with China. The plan lists four methods, which have been presented to President Truman by Ambassador Gu Weijun. Madame Chiang Kai-shek also made a detailed appeal to the US based on this principle and has talked to Secretary of State Marshall twice. She will meet with President Truman again early next week.</p>
<p>According to insiders, Madame Chiang Kai-shek will focus on the following two things: (1) The United States must have a greater understanding of China's situation; (2) China believes that it is not too late to save the overall situation; (3) The Chinese government believes that China is not only fighting for itself, but also fighting for the United States and other anti-communist countries. Madame Chiang Kai-shek is not very concerned about the details of how the US will provide assistance. She only wants the US to act in accordance with the following four methods in the plan proposed by China, namely: (1) Immediately declare that the US sponsors President Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist war to boost military morale. (2) Add and transport military materials before the US Congress passes the aid bill. According to the State Department report, about 125 million yuan of the military aid to China plan has been used up, except for about 100,000 yuan remaining. Senior Chinese officials said that although this money was used to purchase materials, only about 25 million yuan has actually been delivered to China. (3) Send well-known generals to China to take charge of the supply of the National Army, expand military training, and guide strategy. China hopes to send MacArthur to China, but President Truman refused. (4) Establish a three-year military and economic aid to China plan, with an annual subsidy of 1 billion yuan, including the expenses of the military delegation. According to Ambassador Gu Weijun's estimate, 60% of the first year's 1 billion yuan will be used for military aid, and 40% will be used for economic aid. Subsequently, as the military situation progresses, most of it can be used for economic aspects.</p>
<p>Gu told President Truman and State Department personnel that the Chinese government believes that the task can be completed within three years according to this plan. In general, US officials are still unwilling to accept it. According to military estimates, at least 5 billion yuan will be needed in three to four years to save China from the Communist Party. Truman, Marshall, and their advisors have at least temporarily decided that in China's current situation, any aid plan that seeks to be effective will actually be the responsibility of the United States. Both Truman and Marshall are most concerned that the US will be drawn into a situation where the chaos and disintegration of China consumes American money without end.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek originally intended to issue a formal statement on the 4th, but the Chinese Embassy announced that the statement has been postponed to be issued within the next few days.</p>

<h3>The United States Will Never Recognize Any Communist Government in North China; Spruance Urges Not to Stand by and Watch the Chinese War</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 5th] "Business Week" published an article on the 5th, saying: The US government is still looking for an appropriate policy towards China, but "We can guarantee that the US will: (1) Refuse to recognize any North Chinese political regime in North China. American merchants staying in North China will take risks on their own. (2) Refuse any proposals to trade with the CCP and will not allow any American machinery and other production equipment to be shipped to CCP-controlled areas."</p>
<p>[United Press, Monterey, California, 5th] Retired Admiral Spruance said that the situation in China is critical and the US should send a strong delegation to China to guide US actions in China. China's war against Communism is not its own problem. We cannot stand by and watch. If China falls into the hands of the Communist Party, all of Asia (except India and Japan) will fall into the hands of the Communist Party. At that time, the rich resources of Southeast Asia will all be used by the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Unstable and Turbulent Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>The fourth session of the Japanese Diet opened in the House of Councillors on the 2nd. This ordinary session is being held at a time of political turmoil, and its evolution and development are of great importance to the fate of the Yoshida Cabinet. On the opening day of the session, Emperor Hirohito attended and delivered an address to the members of both houses. In addition to praising the democratic spirit of the new constitution, Hirohito also called on members of the Diet to strive to make the Diet the "highest authority of the nation" and to redouble their efforts to gain the Diet's deep understanding of this "democratic and cultural country." Two days after Hirohito's address, Prime Minister Yoshida attended the Diet on the 4th and declared that he would dissolve the House of Representatives after the middle of this month. He said: "Japan needs to sign a peace treaty as soon as possible in order to achieve independence. If Japan does not have a truly democratic government, a peace treaty cannot be expected." Yoshida added: "The one and a half years since the first election after the enactment of the new constitution has been a period of political instability." This clearly illustrates that Yoshida is determined to dissolve the Diet, and this session may be the last gathering after the first general election.</p>
<p>The second Yoshida Cabinet was officially formed on October 19th. Before forming the cabinet, Yoshida fought hard to defeat the "Misaki Movement" conspiracy of Ashida, Miki, and some veteran members of the Liberal Party. After becoming prime minister for the second time, he overcame the opposition of the opposition parties and the indifference of the Allied Headquarters, and finally achieved considerable success in the provisional Diet, completing the revision of the Civil Service Law. Yoshida is a stubborn person who represents the interests of bureaucratic capitalists, landlords, and wealthy farmers. The parliamentarism he is devoted to is bourgeois democratic politics. With a very strong conservative stance, he resists the left-wing and centrist parties. Therefore, he holds a completely disdainful attitude toward the current intermediate Diet. When the Katayama and Ashida cabinets were formed, the Liberal Party did not participate in the government and strongly advocated dissolving the Diet and holding a new general election. When Yoshida was elected prime minister on October 14th, he received only 185 votes of support, with 213 abstentions. The majority of abstentions represent a force that is tantamount to expressing distrust in Yoshida. What Yoshida has been concerned about since taking office is the opposition force represented by these 213 abstentions, which constantly threatens the government. In particular, the Diet's discussion of the supplementary budget and new salary standards may force the government to collapse. Therefore, Yoshida uses dissolving the Diet as a threat, hoping to induce the opposition parties to submit by dissolving the Diet. If the opposition parties in the Diet (the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, the Cooperative Party, etc.) obstruct the government's supplementary budget or new salary standards, it is very likely that Yoshida will invoke Article 7 of the Constitution to dissolve the Diet and hold a new general election.</p>
<p>The new Japanese constitution grants the Diet the power to review and pass the budget, and this power is in the hands of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives. The smooth passage of the budget and tax increase bills of the Katayama and Ashida cabinets was due to the convenience of the situation. On the contrary, the convenience of Katayama and Ashida is Yoshida's difficulty. The Yoshida Cabinet took office in a state of extreme financial distress. In order to maintain the balance of expenditures for the next six months, it can only rely on a supplementary budget. In particular, the adjustment of civil servant salary standards accounts for a large portion of the expenditures, and a supplementary budget is necessary. Otherwise, the Yoshida Cabinet cannot be maintained. Half a year ago, the civil servant salary standard was 3,700 yen. The Socialist Party proposed adjusting it to 6,200 to 7,000 yen, while the labor side demanded 10,000 yen. On November 20th, 35,000 government civil servants held a second march to demand the implementation of the new standard of 7,300 yen, which is far from the figure listed in the government's supplementary budget. During the Ashida cabinet, the Ministry of Finance planned to adjust it to around 5,000 yen. This time, the supplementary budget bill submitted by the Yoshida Cabinet to the Diet stipulates that 5,300 yen should be used as the standard, plus temporary subsidies, totaling about 5,500 yen. If it is increased further, it will damage the interests of capitalists and landlords, which Yoshida is unwilling to do. Undoubtedly, civil servants and workers sympathize with the opposition parties in the Diet, and the opposition parties can use public opinion to confront the government and increase the difficulties of the Yoshida Cabinet. If this confrontational situation develops, unless the government dissolves the Diet, the government will be forced to resign, and the united front of the Socialist, Democratic, and Cooperative parties will make a comeback.</p>
<p>In short, the Yoshida Cabinet is facing difficulties. How Yoshida will overcome the "period of political instability" depends on Yoshida's skills. We must point out that the instability and turbulence of Japanese politics does not equate to the development of democratic politics. At this stage, Japanese politics is still far from the process of democratization. Even if the Diet is dissolved and a new general election is held, the true democratic forces may not be able to emerge. The democratic rhetoric of the Hirohito and Yoshida factions can only be regarded as propaganda. In fact, one cannot feel that Japan at this stage has become a "democratic and cultural country."</p>
<h3>Capital City's Land and Water Transportation Order Fully Restored; Zhang Yaoming's First Measure After Taking Office</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] After two days of rectification, the order at the Xiaguan Railway Station and Wharf in the capital has been fully restored. This is the first measure taken by the newly appointed Capital Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming after taking office. The order at the Xiaguan Railway Station and Wharf has been chaotic in the past week, causing inconvenience to passengers. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the President visited Xiaguan and ordered immediate improvements. Commander Zhang then ordered the Yijiang Gate to be closed from midnight on the 4th, and passengers carrying luggage were not allowed to leave the city in order to clear the luggage accumulated in Xiaguan. Some passengers, including high-ranking officials, who carried luggage out of the city on the 4th were all turned away. The passengers and luggage piled up at the Xiaguan Railway Station were then able to be transported out in an orderly manner. The Yijiang Gate was reopened at 6:00 AM on the 5th. A large number of military police were stationed at the railway station and ferry terminal to maintain order. Those without tickets were not allowed to enter the platform at the railway station, and passengers with tickets had to line up and enter the platform in an orderly manner, waiting for their tickets to be checked. The past situation of passengers crowding onto the train upon arrival, making it impossible for those getting off to squeeze out, has disappeared. In order to facilitate evacuation, Zhang has requested the Railway Bureau to find ways to add more trains to facilitate travel. The ferry terminal strictly prohibits ferries from stopping in the middle of the river and requires them to dock at the pier to avoid the danger of passengers getting on and off in small boats. A large number of police officers are dispatched to the port to maintain order upon arrival of the ships. Getting on the ship is the same as boarding the train, and passengers must line up to avoid crowding. The Capital Land and Water Transportation Service Station established by the Garrison Headquarters, with Deputy Commander Tan Yi concurrently serving as the director, has begun operations, maintaining land and water transportation in the capital and handling the evacuation of passengers, refugees, displaced students, and family members of public servants and teachers. In the future, the collective evacuation of family members of public servants and teachers will also be handled by this station.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] It is reported that the government plans to lease 50 transport planes and 25 ships to evacuate 100,000 officials and their families. Families of personnel from the Presidential Office and the Five Yuan have priority for evacuation. The evacuation will begin on December 10th and will be directed by the Ministry of Transportation. The destinations for evacuation are Chongqing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Capital Public Servants and Teachers' Dependents Evacuation Measures Established</h3>
<p>Ministry of Transportation Establishes Evacuation Committee</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] In order to assist public servants and teachers of central government agencies in the capital to evacuate their families by railway, the Ministry of Transportation has established a Capital Central Government Agency Personnel Family Evacuation Committee and has formulated measures to be implemented immediately. The measures are as follows: (1) Direct relatives of personnel of central government agencies and schools in the capital, limited to parents, spouses, children, and unmarried siblings, who intend to evacuate by railway, should have their names listed by their respective agencies and submitted to the Ministry of Transportation Evacuation Committee for processing. (2) The aforementioned list should clearly state the person's title, name, family relationship, number of people, route, and destination (attached format) and be submitted before December 7th. (3) After receiving the aforementioned list, the Ministry of Transportation Evacuation Committee will schedule dates and issue preferential ticket exchange certificates, limited to 6,000 people per day. This will be from December 10th to the end of December this year, and may be extended if necessary. (4) Evacuated family members should present their preferential certificates to designated locations to exchange for tickets at preferential fares. The trains they should take will be designated by the railway. (5) Evacuated family members should carry their own luggage, limited to two pieces per person (limited to trunks, bedding, or baskets). Other items should be shipped separately according to railway regulations. However, all furniture is absolutely not allowed on the train or to be shipped. (6) Children under the age of six are not counted; those between the ages of six and twelve pay half fare. (7) Public servants and teachers in the capital are limited to one preferential ticket exchange certificate per person. Family members who have been allocated certificates but do not travel at the designated time will not be reallocated, and they may not be transferred to others. The deadline stated on the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line refers to the date for exchanging tickets and boarding the train in Nanjing, and will be invalid after the deadline. (8) During the evacuation period, the Military Police Headquarters should dispatch additional military police to maintain order at the railway station. Agencies and schools should also send one or two representatives to the station to take care of evacuating family members.</p>

<p>[Ministry of Food News, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the repeated requests from major cities such as Tianjin and Taiyuan to the central government to use all the gold certificates collected to purchase foreign grain to alleviate the grain shortage in North China, foreign rice and wheat are subject to the overall distribution of the International Emergency Food Conference, and countries cannot freely purchase beyond the agreed quota. The grain quota obtained by our country is mostly used as a source of grain for urban rationing. An agreement has also been reached with the U.S. side to rush the shipment of more than 130,000 tons of American wheat to Tianjin and Qingdao for flour production within the year, which will be used for rationing in the three cities.

<h3>Berlin West District Municipal Council Elections Voters Eager to Vote Military Police on Guard Against Communist Sabotage</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin 5th Dispatch] The Berlin West District Municipal Council elections were held today. Germans are eagerly lining up to vote. According to the authorities, within five hours of the start of voting, the number of eligible voters who had completed voting exceeded 40% of the total. Official reports from 1,450 constituencies stated that voters in the first three hours accounted for 22% of the total, and the number of voters in the areas bordering the Soviet Union was "particularly large." A serious incident almost occurred in a certain French-occupied area near the Soviet border, but fortunately, a major issue was turned into a minor one. Three Soviet soldiers, armed with light machine guns, reportedly entered a polling station in the Reinickendorf district, threatening voters. French gendarmes were summoned and ordered the Soviet soldiers to withdraw. The Soviet soldiers then retreated to the Grol railway station within the Soviet border. In a certain area of the city, hundreds of German youths carrying wooden sticks attempted to obstruct the work of a polling station and distributed communist propaganda leaflets. Voting in the British, American, and French sectors of Berlin began at 8:00 AM, with Germans waiting in long queues. Elections were prohibited in the Soviet sector, and the Communist Party boycotted the general election in the three western sectors. Public transport in the western sector was suspended from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM to allow 150,000 West Berliners working in the Soviet sector to have the opportunity to vote. Hundreds of German special police from various parts of the Soviet sector had rushed to the Soviet sector of Berlin for unknown reasons. At the start of the election, 10,000 German police were deployed on alert, and British, American, and French troops were also on standby, patrolling the border in jeeps.</p>
<p>Because the strength of the East and West will be answered in this vote, every vote represents one vote for Western democracy and one less vote for communism. There are approximately 1,683,000 eligible voters. The Western occupying authorities and anti-communist parties hope that 75% to 90% of them will vote. If so, the prestige of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union will be greatly damaged, which is equivalent to a major victory for Western democracy.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Likely to Close as Scheduled Political Committee Rejects Proposal to Withdraw Foreign Troops from Holy Land</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 4th Dispatch] The UN General Committee has begun operations to end this session of the General Assembly on the 11th of this month. The United States and the Soviet Union jointly defeated the British proposal to extend the session. According to the British proposal, the General Assembly should only be closed after completing its agenda. In this way, the session will be extended to January next year.</p>
<p>It is understood that the majority of the General Committee agrees to resume work at Lake Success after the New Year. However, Britain still told the committee that it might suggest amending the agenda to raise the issue of handling former Italian colonies before the Korean issue, which will be discussed next time.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 4th Dispatch] The Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Palestine issue this afternoon. During the discussion, the General Assembly voted 33 to 7 with blank votes, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw foreign troops from the Holy Land. By a vote of 26 to 14 with blank votes, the Syrian proposal to establish a central or federal unified Palestinian government was rejected. The British proposal to establish a Palestine Mediation Committee has not yet received the support of a two-thirds majority. The Palestine issue will soon be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. The next agenda of the Political Committee is the Korean issue, which is currently scheduled to begin next Monday. However, the British representative requested that the issue of former Italian colonies be discussed in advance.</p>
<h3>800 American Communists Complete Training in Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Now Returned to US to Train Secret Army</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 4th Dispatch] Investigators of the House Un-American Activities Committee stated on the 4th that 800 members of the American Communist Party trained in Moscow are presiding over the training of secret armies in an attempt to overthrow the United States government. These "800 people were trained at the Lenin School in Moscow and have now returned to the United States." This news is contained in the committee's recently published booklet "100 Things You Should Know About Communism and Education." The committee stated: The Lenin School is the highest communist training school, where students are free to choose courses such as factory sabotage, bomb making, kidnapping, car destruction, riots, civil war, espionage, and infiltration of organizations. The purpose of the school is to produce cadres who know how to create unrest within a country and seize power. In the list of 100 questions and answers, the committee stated: The Communist Party is attempting to seize the American school system. This booklet is one of five pamphlets published by the committee on the techniques of Communist infiltration of organizations.</p>
<h3>Digging Out Pumpkin Reveals US Espionage Documents</h3>

<p>[United Press Washington 5th Dispatch] Due to the powerful new evidence recently discovered in a hollowed-out pumpkin on a farm in Maryland, investigations into two Communist espionage cases were ordered to be resumed on the 5th.

<h3>Mysterious Luminous "Fire Wheel" Falls into US Ohio Residential Area Surrounded by Smoke Like White Snow</h3>
<p>[United Press Fairmount, Ohio 5th Dispatch] A "fire wheel" was suddenly discovered in the sky here on the evening of the 4th, flew into a residential area and fell to the ground. The police department has sent the remaining parts to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, hoping that people in the Air Force Laboratory can determine what the "fire wheel" is and where it came from. When the "fire wheel" came, the entire area was illuminated like a painting, and then it was surrounded by smoke, like clouds. Sheriff Burton said that the remains of this object are quite similar to the tires of airplanes or cars. When this "wheel" landed, a patrol officer tried to put it out, but unexpectedly caused it to disintegrate completely, leaving only two small pieces. Burton believes that this may be part of an experiment with radio wave-controlled weapons at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He said: The parts obtained in the rescue are metallic, and their condition is as if they had been tempered by extraordinary high heat. He initially thought that the "fire wheel" had fallen from an airplane. After investigating the airports in the area, it was learned that no aircraft had lost any parts while passing through Fairmount.</p>

<h3>Earthquake in Southern California Relatively Severe But Damage Minor</h3>
<p>[United Press Los Angeles 4th Dispatch] A relatively severe but less damaging earthquake than the 1932 Long Beach earthquake occurred in Southern California from Ventura to San Diego on the 4th. The earthquake caused thousands of dollars in damage to Palm Springs, and many windows were shattered throughout the region. A mother elephant in the Griffith Park Zoo had a miscarriage as a result. The only reason why it did not cause major damage and death was because the epicenter of the earthquake was in the La Coachella Desert.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Asia</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi</p>
<p>Based on this policy, the United States has allowed France to transfer $35 million from the Marshall Plan funds to Indochina, in the hope of enabling France to regain its "occupier" position in Indochina. Similarly, the United States has also allowed the Netherlands to transfer $54 million from the Marshall Plan funds to Indonesia, in the hope of restoring its old power.</p>
<p>Transferring European aid funds to Asia in this way is a major mistake by the United States, and as a result, voices of opposition have risen throughout Asia. Former Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir, a friend of the United States, said: "What we hope from the United States is to enable small nations to gain freedom, independence, and democracy. But in reality, the United States' policy is to support the colonial authorities, which is contrary to our wishes. So our dissent cannot be attributed to us."</p>
<p>The movement now being launched by the Communist Party in Asia is unfavorable to the United States. Most of the local Communist leaders have been trained in Moscow. In the Far East, their only slogan is land reform and improvement of tenant farmers' treatment.</p>
<p>In China, the Communist Party has been fighting against the central government for twenty years, and is now gradually expanding its controlled areas.</p>
<p>In Japan, although the activities of the Communist Party are restricted by the Allied forces, it still has its position. The Communist Party's strength in Japan is strong in trade unions, the National Labor Liaison Council, and other independent united organizations.</p>
<p>In Indochina, the Communist Party's power has only been cultivated after two years. Their leader is a person who has been trained in Moscow. Other Communist leaders also serve as commanders in the Vietnamese army.</p>
<p>In Siam, the people have little affection for the Communist Party, and the official hope is to take a neutral stance in the Cold War. But in an era of terror, with the Communist Party gaining an advantage throughout Asia, Siam may not be safe.</p>
<p>In Malaya, what the Communist Party is plotting is to drive away the British who run rubber plantations and tin mines. In May, they attempted to organize a nationalist army but failed. Now they are organizing guerrillas, planning to create terrorist incidents, assassinations, and other labor unrest. Although the Communist Party cannot legitimately organize an independent army, it has the ability to make Malaya uneasy.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, Communist power is being actively cultivated. In the early days of the organization of the Republic of Indonesia, the power of the Communist Party was still very weak, but now the Indonesian Communist Party has the ability to overthrow the government. Because the United States announced its support for the Netherlands, the Communist Party's excuse is anti-Americanism. Communists occupy a quarter of the seats in the Provisional Parliament of the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>In Burma, the Communist Party is plotting underground, resisting the socialist government that only became independent from Britain a year ago. The residents of central Burma are more inclined to Communism, and the rebel army includes veterans, former Burmese soldiers, and military police. The current Burmese government is using a policy of freely distributing farmland to benefit tenant farmers in order to escape the red disaster.</p>
<p>In India, the expansion of Communist power is being restricted, and the government is imprisoning many Communist leaders. But in the southern provinces of India, they are still supported by the rural masses, and this potential power is a hint of a future military coup by the Indian Communist Party.</p>
<p>In short, the Cold War in Asia is getting hotter and hotter. The Communist Party is expanding its power in both political and military aspects. According to general observations, the United States is failing in the Cold War in Asia, but it is still kept in the dark. If it does not change its policy, the consequences will be disastrous.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the explosion and sinking of the Jiangya steamer outside Wusongkou, yesterday evening at Jiangwan Airport, another Central Air Transport Corporation C-46 type No. 538 Chongqing-Shanghai flight crashed and burned due to fog. The pilot, co-pilot, and radio operator were all killed. Eight of the 18 passengers died (including one infant), and ten were injured. Five of the deceased bodies were transported to the China Funeral Home for handling that night. One body only had half left, and it was still under the fuselage. It was not excavated last night because of the lack of time. Five people died shortly after being transported to Gongji Hospital. The injured are now all being treated at Gongji Hospital. The details of the accident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Central Air Transport Corporation flight No. 538 Chongqing-Shanghai took off from Chongqing at 11:30 yesterday morning, carrying passengers Xu Daozi, Zhong Shizhao, Zhong (child), Yang Fahui, Zhang Zhongche, and others, five people in total.

At about 4:00 PM, after passing Nanjing, the weather had changed greatly, with heavy fog in the sky and the airport already closed. The plane flew directly to Shanghai. It arrived over the city at around 5:00 PM. At that time, it was also raining and foggy. Longhua Airport had poor equipment and could not land, so the air traffic control tower notified it to contact Jiangwan Air Force Airport (with radar equipment) to try to land. At 5:48 PM, under the guidance of US ground personnel, the aircraft slowly descended towards the runway. Unexpectedly, when it was about to touch down, due to the extremely heavy fog on the ground and poor visibility, the left wing crashed violently into a mound about ten meters from the north end of the runway. Immediately, the fuselage split, and the left engine caught fire and burned. Seeing this, US military and our air force personnel at the airport immediately tried to rescue them, urgently telephoning the fire department for assistance, and Gongji Hospital to send vehicles to transport the dead and injured. Cai Zhiren, director of the Central Air Transport Corporation Shanghai station, also immediately led company office staff to the scene to handle the aftermath after hearing the news. The flames in the aircraft were soon extinguished. Six people in the aircraft died on the spot. Except for one person who was pressed under the fuselage and could not be dug out, five bodies were immediately transported to the China Funeral Home. The remaining injured were immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but five of them died from their injuries shortly after arriving at the hospital. The remaining luggage and belongings in the aircraft were concentrated and temporarily stored at the airport, guarded by personnel sent by the company and the airport. This morning, Central Air Transport Corporation will continue to send personnel to the airport to excavate the other body and handle other aftermath matters.</p>
<h3>List of Dead and Injured</h3>

According to the passenger list, they should be three of the four people Xu Daozi, Chen Zhixiang, Guan Puzhao, and Dong Guoyong, but one of them did not actually come to Shanghai, and Liu Zizhong (a staff officer of the Garrison Command, only slightly injured) replaced him. Therefore, it is not yet clear which three people are. As of the time of publication, Central Company is still sending personnel to the China Funeral Home to investigate the documents on the bodies.</p>

<h3>Relief for Wandering Refugees in Shanghai: Social Affairs Bureau Distributes Gruel</h3>

<h3>Dissatisfaction Among Teachers and Staff of Municipal Schools Regarding the Method of Distributing Confiscated Materials</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Teachers and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools previously requested improved living conditions and implemented a general leave. After persuasion by Mayor Wu and others, they cancelled their leave and returned to teaching. The municipal government then planned to distribute confiscated materials from the price-controlled period to all public employees in the city. It is now learned that after several meetings, most of the confiscated materials, such as coal, oil, and paper, must be returned. Only cigarettes can be sold for 300,000 yuan, which can be distributed to 50,000 public employees throughout the city, with each person receiving approximately 6 yuan. Teachers and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools were quite disappointed after hearing this, believing that it was too far from their original requests. They expressed their refusal to accept it and will hold meetings separately in the near future to discuss countermeasures. This morning, representatives of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Association will meet with Mayor Wu to ask the mayor to clarify how the confiscated materials will be distributed and request that the December salaries be paid in advance.</p>

Therefore, the Central Brigade, Jing'an Temple Brigade, and Songshan Brigade were dispatched to assist in the rescue. The fire was brought under control, and it was completely extinguished at about 6:00 AM. When the fire broke out, it was late at night, and more than ten workers from the Great China Tobacco Company were unable to escape from their sleep and were buried in the fire pit.

The fire department is still investigating the truth. In addition, firefighters have dug up five bodies at the scene of the fire yesterday, and will continue to excavate today.

<h3>Aftermath of the Jiangya Steamer Tragedy: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Dispatches Ship to Recover Bodies; Over 300 Family Members of Victims Accompany; Ningbo Compatriot Association to Convene Emergency Meeting This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo liner "Jiangya" of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company encountered an accident on the evening of the 3rd off Bailonggang near Litongsha outside Wusongkou. This newspaper has been closely following the situation. Yesterday, being Sunday, the company's passenger ticket department remained open to handle the aftermath of the Jiangya incident. Over three hundred family members of the victims arrived at the company early in the morning to inquire about news, their weeping and sorrow a truly heartrending scene. They requested the company dispatch a ship to the accident site to search for and recover bodies, resulting in a loud and chaotic scene due to the large number of people voicing their concerns. Subsequently, the company dispatched the "Haihu" steamer, which had just returned to Shanghai from Tianjin, to the accident site at around 11:00 AM yesterday, carrying over three hundred family members of the victims. Simultaneously, the "Jian" steamer was also dispatched, carrying several radio operators to provide updates at all times. Around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, a small number of passengers' family members suddenly claimed that they had discovered recovered silver shields, furs, and other items in the company's police department room. All thirty or so family members gathered to observe and questioned the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as to why the bodies had not been found, but the items had already been recovered and transported back to Shanghai. According to the family members of the passengers, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously dispatched the "Qiujin" steamer to recover bodies, but returned to Shanghai without finding any. Therefore, they expressed doubts about when these items were brought back to Shanghai. They also stated that the furs were still wet, proving they must belong to the passengers who were in distress. The silver shield was engraved with the words "Congratulations to Mr. Xiaxuan of Tongchun Money Exchange on His Honorable Appointment." The family members also requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to investigate and announce whether this "Mr. Xiaxuan" was also one of the passengers in distress. As no responsible personnel from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were present at the scene at the time, the commotion continued for a long time without any resolution.</p>
<p>At the urging of this newspaper, a decision to raise three demands was made.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM in the evening, the family members of the passengers in distress appointed Li Zuan, Wu Wenlong, Zhu Hangen, and Ren Jinzhen as representatives to come to this newspaper, expressing their collective grief and indignation after the incident, appealing for justice, and stating that they would make three demands to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: (1) When the family members of the passengers were dispersed on the evening of the 4th, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company promised that all departments would remain open on the 5th (Sunday) to handle the matter, but this was not implemented yesterday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should immediately appoint someone to negotiate the aftermath with the family members. (2) The family members should accompany the search for and recovery of bodies at the accident site. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should fulfill this daily until the family members are satisfied, and the search situation should be telegraphed to Shanghai three times a day (morning, noon, and afternoon) for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to announce. (3) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should be responsible for thoroughly investigating and announcing the cause of the incident and the fact that the clothes of distressed passengers were found and transported to Shanghai before the bodies were recovered.</p>
<p>The company's shipping department has now decided to dispatch the "Haiqian" to transport them to the accident site again at 9:00 AM this morning. The family members of the victims will board the ship at the third wharf at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Over a Thousand People Registered as Victims Yesterday</p>
<p>On the other hand, the family members of some of the victims gathered at the Ningbo Compatriot Association yesterday to discuss the matter and decided to start registering the victims immediately. As of last night, 1,020 people had been registered. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association will convene an emergency board of directors meeting, which the representatives of the victims' families will attend. Important decisions regarding relief and negotiations will be made.</p>
<h3>Company Authorities Declare: Determined to Handle Aftermath with Full Effort</h3>
<p>Last night, a reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Shen Zhongyi, Deputy General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. According to him, after the Jiangya incident, the company immediately made every effort to handle the aftermath. On the night of the incident, multiple ships were urgently dispatched for rescue, and vessels from other companies also bravely participated, rescuing approximately one thousand passengers and crew members, the complete list of whom has been officially announced. Rescue ships were dispatched on the morning of the 4th to actively search day and night. A special ship was dispatched yesterday morning to transport the victims' families to the accident site for on-site inspection, and it was decided to continue this for three more days, dispatching a special ship at 9:00 AM every morning to transport the families for inspection (due to tidal conditions, it can only depart once a day, otherwise it will not be able to return on the same day). A relief committee has been established to specifically handle the aftermath. Yesterday afternoon, senior company officials held a meeting, chaired by General Manager Xu himself, who earnestly instructed the company's personnel to devote all their efforts to this matter. Starting today, a liaison office will be established at 33 Fuzhou Road by the relief committee, and someone will be assigned to be responsible for contacting all the family members and handling all matters. As for the cause of the incident, after much research, it was determined that it was not caused by a boiler explosion or other defects in the ship itself. As for whether it was a water mine or a time bomb, it is still under investigation and a detailed report will be released soon. However, although this accident was beyond the company's control, the company expresses its deepest sympathy for the passengers and crew members in distress and will do its best to handle the matter properly. It is hoped that all the families of the victims will share in the difficulties, control their grief, and calmly cope with the situation to ensure proper handling.</p>
<h3>Citywide Industrial Circles Hold General Assembly and Discuss Issues: Establish Anti-Communist National Salvation Association; Conduct Widespread Fundraising for the Military and Strengthen Anti-Rebellion Propaganda</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a joint meeting of all directors and supervisors and persons in charge of various trade unions at the Yucai Middle School Auditorium on Shanhai Guan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to review the current situation and invite representatives of the industrial community's delegation to Xuzhou to report on what they saw on the front lines and the process of expressing sympathy and support. A total of more than 600 directors, supervisors, and persons in charge of various trade unions attended, and Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian (represented by Shen Ding), Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor Lu Jingshi, Yi Chang Fan Gongzhan, and Supervisory Committee member Tao Baichuan were invited to speak. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, Zhou Xuexiang, chairman of the federation, delivered a speech stating that the country is currently implementing a total war, and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles to suppress the bandits. The significance of the federation convening this meeting today is that all workers in the city should review and understand the current war situation. If we want to stabilize the morale of Shanghai and maintain social order, we must strengthen our resolve and unity. Then, Chen Boliang and Sun Jinghu, representatives of the Shanghai industrial community who went to Xuzhou to express sympathy and support, reported on the process of expressing sympathy and support and the impressions they gained.</p>
<p>Speeches by the Mayor and Others</p>
<p>Mayor Wu was then invited to speak, saying that recently, Shanghai citizens have been talking about escaping every day, believing that Shanghai will eventually be lost. This kind of subconscious judgment is the most undesirable. He believes that the Beijing-Shanghai area is not in danger at all, and the most dangerous thing is the fear that should not exist in people's minds. He hopes that all the workers in the city will unite to achieve true stability. Subsequently, Lu Jingshi, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, delivered a speech, saying that the significance of the industrial community holding this joint meeting is extremely important. Every worker should have a deep understanding of the current situation in order to dispel the terror in everyone's minds. Lu also suggested that the industrial community should mobilize to organize an anti-communist national salvation organization and strive for the future of the country, the nation, and individuals.</p>
<p>Ten Proposals Passed</p>
<p>After the leaders finished speaking, the discussion of proposals began, and the following points were passed: (1) Establish the Shanghai Industrial Community Anti-Communist National Salvation Mobilization Committee and invite persons in charge of various trade unions to participate. (2) All workers in the city should donate ten yuan each to express sympathy and support to the soldiers on the front lines. This donation should be completed before the 15th of this month and will be managed by the Mobilization Committee. (3) The property of people who have fled to Hong Kong should be requisitioned, and their private residences should be allocated to hospitals. (4) The workers themselves should rise up to eliminate spies and bandits. (5) Expand anti-communist national salvation propaganda and authorize the Mobilization Committee to be responsible for planning. (6) Pass a declaration on the current situation. (7) Send a telegram to the whole country to respond to the military labor movement. (8) Send a telegram to express sympathy and support to the soldiers on the front lines. (9) People who have fled to Hong Kong are not allowed to return to Shanghai. (10) Negotiate to borrow all radio stations in the city to expand propaganda.</p>
<h3>General Association of Tenants Holds Symposium: Opposes Unreasonable Rent Increases; Four Measures Resolved</h3>
<p>In order to oppose the recent unreasonable and unauthorized rent increases by real estate owners, the Shanghai General Association of Tenants held a symposium on rent issues at the Daguan Society on West Nanjing Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. It was chaired by Jiang Hao, and over 100 directors, supervisors, and representatives of tenants' associations from various districts of the city, including Zhang Zhongyuan, He Yuanming, Ma Junshuo, Chen Peide, Shao Yongsheng, and Lu Shuda, attended. During the meeting, the representatives expressed their extreme indignation at the unreasonable rent increases by real estate owners and decided that, except for those who agree to a reasonable agreement through mutual consultation, they would take unified action and refuse to pay the illegal new rent. After heated speeches lasting three hours, the following four specific measures were finally resolved: (1) Submit a request to the Municipal Council to revise the maximum rent limit. (2) Before the new limit is set, the old limit of 7,000 to 9,000 times the pre-war rent should still be valid in accordance with legal principles. If the landlord demands payment, it can be deposited in the bank. (3) Before the new limit is set, if the tenant is willing to adjust the rent, they can negotiate with the landlord. As for the highest number to be adjusted, He Yuanming, Jiang Hao, Shao Yongsheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Chen Peide, Ma Junshuo, and Lu Shuda are nominated to form a subcommittee to conduct detailed research and formulate a plan to notify all members to take unified action. (4) When the rent is adjusted, the deposit rent shall not be recovered, and it shall be at least six months as one period, and no adjustment shall be made within the period. According to reports from tenant representatives such as Lu Shuda, the real estate owners had exchanged views before the rent increase and decided on the rent increase standard, which was based on two principles: restoring the pre-war rent level and adding 250 to 350 times the rent on August 19. However, some landlords who sought excessive profits charged rent far exceeding this standard. Councilor Chen Peide, in his capacity as a tenant representative, pointed out that the monthly rent for his residence at No. 8 Xianfang on Huageguo Road before the war was 18 yuan. On "August 19," it was 135,000 yuan in legal tender. The notice he recently received stated that the rent would be increased to 135 gold yuan from September, a rate of increase that was unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Korean Special Envoy to China Visits Chairman Pan</h3>

<h3>Gospel of Education for the Poor in the Frontier: Interview with Ai Zhenhua</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhan, Reporter of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Aviation News from Zhangjiakou, November 2] Ms. Ai Zhenhua, who is dedicated to elementary education in Zhangjiakou, educates a group of poor children who are not qualified to enter school with the spirit of a missionary. This noble spirit is comparable to that of any great educator of any era, and it also allows her to surpass Mr. Wu Xun, who founded schools by begging.</p>
<p>The reporter visited Ms. Ai Zhenhua in the slum of Zhangjiakou. Her "school" is not officially registered with the Education Bureau, and the municipal government does not provide any subsidies. She started the school and plans to expand it. Her efforts have been praised by the society. Perhaps people do not know about other schools, but no one does not know about Ai Zhenhua in the slum and the elementary school she runs.</p>
<p>Residence Is the School</p>
<p>That is a cluster of small houses on a hillside on the edge of the city. One of them, which is relatively clean, is Mr. Ai's residence, which is also the school. In the summer, students take classes in the courtyard. In the winter, her bedroom becomes the classroom. She has an eleven-year-old daughter, who is intelligent and lively, and is her teaching assistant (little teacher) and school worker. Mr. Ai talked about her motivation for starting this slum elementary school, saying: "Most of the people here are illiterate, and their living habits tend to be degraded. Most school-age children are rejected from school, scolding on the streets and playing in the alleys all day long, which is tantamount to declaring their hopelessness and terror in the future. Some, though not to this extent, are drafted into the army at a considerable age. When they leave, the mother and son are reluctant to part and cry together. After half a year or several months, they do not see a word sent back. The mother and son are very worried, but they have no way to express it. Every time I see this scene, I feel deeply sighed, so I rely on my conscience and do my best to educate poor children who cannot afford to study." Their parents and people in the society agree very much and give me great comfort.</p>
<p>Tree Branches and Iron Nails Instead of Pens</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of the school, Mr. Ai said: "I first obtained the consent of the head of the district and the parents of the students. I borrowed a small blackboard of less than six feet from an acquaintance, bought a box of chalk, and borrowed a small clock. I gathered more than 20 children from the neighborhood, and we were able to hold open-air classes in the courtyard in early February. They are all poor students, and they do not have any school supplies at all. I had to write the words on the blackboard, and the students used tree branches, iron nails, and other hard objects instead of pens. The square in the courtyard is paper or slate.</p>
<p>Classroom Transformation Successful</p>
<p>This kind of situation lasted for more than four months. Summer came, and the scorching sun was in the sky. The malnourished bodies of the children could not stand the burning sun. So, in early June, the teachers and students worked together to transform a classroom (as I saw it). A carpenter was hired to change a large table into four small tables. In this simple classroom, they are taught words and etiquette. The reporter saw that the students had a polite attitude, which was completely unlike the group of wild children often seen elsewhere, and was very moved. I thought of Rousseau's saying: "The depravity of children is mostly due to the lack of proper guidance," which contains the truth.</p>
<p>Dedication to Educational Determination</p>
<p>Running such a simple school is by no means an easy task, and it cannot be done without perseverance. Mr. Ai talked about her difficulties and the hope in the difficulties. She said: "The lack of formal school buildings limits the number of children who want to come to study. Moreover, it is too difficult to run it this way. There is no source of funding for the school, and I will never be willing to give up halfway. I have made up my mind to devote myself to this, just like devoting myself to religion, and do my best to help the poor compatriots. I hope that this school can be developed into a well-established school with the sympathy and assistance of enthusiastic people. I am working hard towards this goal."</p>
<p>Born in an Orphanage</p>
<p>Ms. Ai Zhenhua is 42 years old this year, and her face is full of wrinkles, which shows her past hard work. She is from Salachi County, Suiyuan. When she was one year old, her mother committed suicide by smoking opium. She was adopted by the teacher E Bige and grew up in an orphanage. She graduated from a normal school run by the church and then became a missionary. She first married Zhao Jun, a teaching assistant, but unfortunately, Zhao Jun died early. She remarried Dr. Shen. They came to Zhangjiakou in the year the Japanese surrendered. Ms. Ai was raised by a pastor, so she dedicated her life to religion. Because of her unfortunate background, she is even more grateful to God and serves the poor people with great piety.</p>
<p>In the desolate frontier wilderness, the school founded by Mr. Ai has real value. Naturally, her school needs sympathy and assistance very much.</p>

<h3>Chenxi, Western Hunan: Coal Mine Flooded; Miners Buried; Five Survivors</h3>
<p>[Express News from Changsha, November 29] Chenxi, Western Hunan, is one of the coal mining areas in Hunan. Although there are no large-scale companies mining, there are many small private companies. Among them, there is the Huimin Coal Mining Company, which uses old methods for mining. Recently, due to equipment reasons, a tragic mine flooding occurred. The details are as follows: At 6:00 PM on October 18, all the miners in the cave had left work and left the cave, but a small number of well workers and diggers continued to work in the cave in order to increase their income. Unexpectedly, the mine was suddenly flooded with water. When the company used a water pump to rescue them, the power failed. As a result, this group of miners left in the cave were buried alive in this dark hell. It was not until November 17 that the company made every effort to pump out all the stored water in the cave and dredge the mine. When they entered the cave at that time, in addition to finding seven dead bodies, they actually found five living people. These five people had been there for more than 20 days. It is reported that after the cave was flooded and isolated from the outside world, they ate the bodies of the dead when they were extremely hungry in order to survive. Now, because these five people have been isolated from the sunlight for too long, they dare not move out of the cave and are temporarily staying in the cave, and the company sends them rice soup every day to survive.</p>
<h3>Courts Withdrawn from Northern Jiangsu and Centralized in Yangzhou and Taizhou for Office</h3>
<p>[News from Suzhou, November 2] The Jiangsu High Court believes that in recent times, the local courts and judicial offices in some disaster-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu have withdrawn due to banditry, and the transmission of official documents is extremely difficult. Therefore, President Liang has stipulated that the courts withdrawn from various places should be concentrated in Yangzhou and Taizhou to establish joint offices in order to obtain contact.</p>
<p>[Another News] Shen Jinghua, the pseudo-county magistrate of this county, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court. Shen was still not satisfied after the sentence was passed and yesterday filed another petition to the Jiangsu High Court for retrial.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Province Intensifies Preparations for the Establishment of the Guizhou Products Transportation and Sales Company</h3>
<p>— Liu Mengchi, Reporter of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Aviation News from Guiyang, November 26] In recent years, Guizhou Province's agricultural production has achieved great results due to the authorities' active advocacy and the people's self-consciousness and initiative. Among them, American tobacco, tung oil, and rapeseed oil have achieved the most remarkable results. The American tobacco planting area is almost all over the province, with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of stones. It is of excellent quality and sells well outside the province. The tung oil production area covers a total area of ​​approximately 200,000 acres, with an annual oil production of more than 160,000 stones. Rapeseed oil has always been a common winter crop in the province, with an annual output of more than 2 million dan of rapeseed. This year, after the provincial government issued an order to increase production in various counties, it also sent personnel to supervise the implementation on the ground. It is expected that the results will be even better next spring. Both tung oil and rapeseed oil are export materials, which are of great benefit to the construction of rural areas in the province and the prosperity of the national economy. However, most of Guizhou Province's export materials must pass through Guangdong. Guangdong's control over the transit of materials from neighboring provinces is extremely strict. For example, tung oil and rapeseed oil, all those that pass through Guangdong for export or are sold in Guangzhou, must be sold to the semi-official South China Trading Company for 60% of the price, and the price is lower than the market price, so the losses suffered by the business and agricultural circles in Guizhou Province are extremely significant. In order to promote agricultural production and regulate the supply and demand of materials, the authorities in Guizhou Province have ordered the relevant authorities to conduct in-depth research on how to develop inter-provincial trade and increase the production of export materials. It has recently been decided to establish the "Guizhou Products Transportation and Sales Company" so that the market can be centralized, the provincial government can supervise, and the large-scale needs of foreign countries outside the province can be met. It can also purchase essential important materials for rural areas in the province. Chairman Gu Zhenglun has appointed He Jiwu, Director of the Construction Department, and Zhu Maicang, former General Manager of the Gansu Provincial Bank, as the directors and deputy directors of the preparatory committee. The preparations have officially started on the 15th and are planned to be completed by the end of the year. The official establishment is scheduled for January next year.</p>
<h3>Chenjiaqiao Incident in Wuxi: Councilor Narrates the Process</h3>
<p>[News from Wuxi, November 1] Regarding the report that villagers in Chenjiaqiao had a mutual assault incident with students from the Henan Joint Middle School, Councilor Cai Yan of Tianyi Township stated the facts as follows:</p>
<p>At about 7:00 AM on November 25, after the students of Chenjiaqiao Henan Joint Middle School were dismissed after being addressed in the playground, they passed through Chenjiaqiao Street, snatched sesame seed cakes to eat, and had a verbal conflict with the shop owner. The students then threatened the shop owner with bayonets and destroyed furniture, arousing public anger among the villagers. The students immediately fled back to the school. The villagers then rushed to the school to reason with the teachers. In the chaos, the furniture in the school was damaged. At that time, Hu, the district chief of Zhangcun District, who was in charge, immediately led a team to suppress the situation, persuaded the villagers, and had the school's Zu Bao punish the students who caused the incident and compensate the sesame seed cake shop for its losses. The villagers then dispersed.</p>
<p>An hour later, the students from Youjia Ancestral Hall and Laoye Temple in the township learned that the items in the school had been damaged, and they were furious. They rushed to various places with wooden sticks, triangular irons, and bayonets (the triangular irons and bayonets taken from the students have been handed over to Section Chief Mu of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters) and beat people indiscriminately, regardless of whether they were men, women, old or young. The villagers were unable to dodge and resisted, causing a mutual assault. At that time, the villagers Gu Jinquan, Cai Wudu, and Mao Shi were seriously injured (and are now receiving treatment at Wuxi Public Hospital), and dozens of others were slightly injured. At that time, when District Chief Hu learned of the incident, he immediately declared martial law and went to the scene of the incident with the councilor and Director An of the school to persuade them before they dispersed. He also sent the injured from both sides to the district office to find ways to treat them, and the assault stopped. The report that the villagers fired guns and beat gongs, and that the students jumped into the river and went missing, is not a matter of attack.</p>
<h3>Rural Reconstruction Committee Decides on Subsidy Plan</h3>
<p>[Aviation News from Chengdu, November 2] Chiang Menglin, chairman of the Rural Reconstruction Committee, and committee members Yan Yangchu and others, came to Sichuan for six days to inspect Beibei, Baxian, and Bishan, and gained a good impression of the water conservancy in western Sichuan and the rural construction in eastern Sichuan. After careful consultation between the Chinese and American committee members, a preliminary subsidy plan was decided for rural construction in Sichuan Province, and a statement was issued before departure, including: (1) Subsidize 400,000 US dollars for the 11 water conservancy and irrigation projects in Sichuan that have started but not yet been completed, including the Heishihe Weir of Dujiangyan in Guanxian County, the Shiyang Weir in Chengdu, the Dahunian in Huayang, the Baixian Weir, the Qingjujie in Nanchong, and the Keting Weir in Santai, to help them complete the projects. After these projects are completed next spring, they can irrigate at least 191,000 acres of good farmland. (2) The Agricultural Committee will subsidize the third administrative commissioner's district in Sichuan Province with a considerable amount of funds to promote rural construction work, and the three counties of Beibei, Bishan, and Baxian will be designated as comprehensive rural construction districts. The remaining personnel will be ordered to promote some of the undertakings as experimental areas. (3) Specific subsidies and improvements will be planned for the special products of cotton production in northern Sichuan, the sugar industry in Zinei, and tung oil in various parts of Sichuan, as well as animal husbandry in western Sichuan. (4) General rural construction undertakings, such as film and broadcasting education, agricultural production, rural construction and health, cooperative organizations, and local improvement matters, are planned to be promoted in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<h3>Training Is More Important Than Everything: Jurong Receives Commendation</h3>
<p>[News from Jurong, November 2] In order to establish the current special political style, County Magistrate Chen Tianzhi launched the "Talent Goes to the Countryside" movement as soon as he took office. Therefore, he first trained a group of intermediate-level cadres—township insurance attachments—together with Lishui County. Later, with "training determines everything" and "training is more important than everything," he further launched a universal training for lower-level cadres—bao team attachments. At that time, although the former County Magistrate Shi Qimin had stolen and sold all the grain in the county, and the county's finances were facing a dead end, for the sake of the above special importance, all sacrifices and difficulties were ignored and it was successfully completed. The Capital Garrison Headquarters issued a commendation for the unified development of mass organization training in the county.</p>

<h3>Communism in China, September 1948, Compiled by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>— Special Translation Elaborated by This Newspaper</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>5. The so-called "New Democracy" is merely a means to achieve coups and dictatorship, just as it manifested in Czechoslovakia in February 1948.</p>
<p>6. If a coalition cabinet of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must be formed, either party will have the right of veto and can overthrow the coalition government.</p>
<p>7. If this is the case, then a unanimous voting system must replace a majority voting system—the weakest political system in history.</p>
<p>8. If we cannot make a coalition government that accommodates the Communist Party effective in Berlin, Korea, Greece, or the European Recovery Program, how can we expect the Chinese to make it effective?</p>
<p>9. World peace based on freedom has not yet been established, and the security of the United States cannot be considered a trivial matter.</p>
<p>10. The expansion of Communist forces is enough to strengthen their means and ability to continue dividing the non-communist world.</p>
<p>11. The genuine independence of China is absolutely necessary for the security of the United States.</p>
<p>12. Without the assistance of other countries, China's independence cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>13. Although China is large, the assistance given to it can be much smaller than that given to Europe, and it can still be effective. China particularly needs technical advisors.</p>
<p>Each side has quick rebuttals to the reasons put forward by the other. Those who support aid to China give the following simple reply to the opponents:</p>
<p>"We will face a red China, which will strengthen the power of the Communist Party to dominate the world. Not only will you be surprised, but it will also be a major loss for us."</p>
<p>Opponents of aid to China reply to the supporters as follows:</p>
<p>"You cannot guarantee that your assistance can create a free, democratic, and strong China that can be self-reliant and help build world peace."</p>
<p>But those who support assistance will offer a final reply as follows:</p>
<p>"We certainly cannot guarantee success, but without assistance, the imminent loss of China is inevitable. Before China is irretrievably lost, we still have time to try and learn. Solving major problems takes time. Abandoning the entire problem and surrendering to the Communist Party is not the way to peace, but the road to war. If peace is possible, it is not because the dream of conciliation has become a reality today, but because we can quickly learn how to build a stable and strong non-communist world. We cannot win the race if we do not run. We cannot even stop the race from proceeding, because the other side is running. The prize of peace is placed at the end of the track, whether it is a peace of freedom, or a peace in the ashes of a world dominated by the Soviets."</p>
<p>E. American Mediation and Assistance</p>
<p>At the end of the war, the United States was entrusted with maintaining reconciliation between democratic countries and Soviet countries, and the hope of peace was placed on this. From the international cooperation of the United Nations to the quadripartite control of Germany, to the division of Korea into North and South, and even to the signing of peace treaties. This hope of reconciliation finally became a bubble. The Truman Declaration issued on March 12, 1947, can be regarded as the United States publicly acknowledging the irreconcilability between communism and democracy. Since then, the United States has continued to strive to make the dream of reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party a reality.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the "victory," the United States immediately endeavored to assist the various parties in China to establish a national unity agreement. Mao Zedong came to Chongqing on August 26, 1945, at the urging of Ambassador Hurley. In November, after the Chinese civil war had reached a serious stage, Hurley resigned, and then General Marshall was sent to China as a special envoy. On December 15, 1945, President Truman issued a statement on American policy toward China, recognizing the National Government as the legitimate government of all of China, but calling for national unity and stating that the United States would never interfere in Chinese affairs in a way that would "control the conduct of the Chinese civil war."</p>
<p>From August to November 1945, the United States seemed to explicitly support the National Government, while the Soviet Union remained silent. The negotiations between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong proceeded smoothly. However, Ambassador Hurley was attacked by American leftist groups, which weakened his credibility with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>General Marshall, with his immense prestige and strong will, maintained the negotiations until the point of failure. In January 1946, a ceasefire agreement was established; in the spring of the same year, the National Government and the Communist Party prepared to sign an agreement extending the scope of the ceasefire to the Northeast. However, before the agreement was signed, Marshall left China and returned to the United States, so it was never signed. On April 15, the Communist Party announced that the Northeast was in a state of war. A few days later, Marshall returned to China and continued to work for peace within China, until the spring of 1947, when he declared that he had given up his efforts and issued a statement on January 7, criticizing both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. From that time on, the United States recognized the state of civil war in China, and Chiang Kai-shek tried his best to make the United States aware that he had tried his best to avoid war, but by this time the war was already very fierce. In the summer of 1947, General Wedemeyer came to China to investigate the Chinese situation, but his report was never published. At this time, the United States finally changed its policy of refusing to provide assistance until unity in China was achieved, and the United States Congress finally passed a substantial aid to China bill in March 1948.</p>
<p>The CCP has always insisted on two special conditions in the negotiations. First, they insisted on self-organized troops, and the minimum condition for the establishment of a demobilization agreement was that the Communist Party must have eight divisions. Second, the Communist Party should occupy a certain number of seats in the cabinet, and this should be determined through fair political consultation. This is undoubtedly the policy of "New Democracy," which is the policy followed by the governments of Eastern European countries after the war.</p>
<p>The United States government, based on an assumption that communism and democracy could be reconciled, resolutely acted as a mediator in China, an effort that exceeded its limits. The kind of proposal that the United States made to the Chinese was unprecedented in history. The intention of the Communist Party to use seats in the cabinet has already been demonstrated in most countries today. In a coalition cabinet that accommodates a party intent on dictatorship, the fate of small parties has been clearly demonstrated in the first cabinet of Soviet Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, and in the first cabinets of Mussolini and Hitler. In the above three cabinets, although members of parties other than the ruling party participated, that ruling party was cruel and ruthless, and the result easily turned into a dictatorship. From this point of view, it seems strange that some people occasionally express doubts about the sincerity of the United States in promoting peace talks, or about the sincerity of Chiang Kai-shek in conducting peace talks. The efforts of the United States to cater to the CCP went beyond the extent of compromise.</p>
<p>The two years of efforts by the United States to mediate have proven that it is impossible to form a democratic coalition government with the Communist Party, not only in China, but also in countries around the world. It is clear that "New Democracy" is merely a euphemism for the rapid transition from the proletariat holding power to the dictatorship of the proletariat. In March 1948, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US House of Representatives passed a resolution to provide China with military and economic assistance. This resolution was supported by the House and Senate, and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1948 was enacted and passed.</p>
<p>F. Weaknesses of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>Communism in China has many important advantages and takes advantage of many favorable environments. But Chinese communism also has its weaknesses. There are several weaknesses related to the CCP's chances of achieving dictatorship. Other weaknesses relate to the CCP's ability to engage in construction after gaining power. The consequences caused by all its weaknesses are not that it can be ignored by us, but that it may and inevitably be defeated by us.</p>
<p>In recent years, those who oppose American aid to China have held very strange views. Some writers believe that the Communist Party cannot seize China, so there is no need to oppose it. Others believe that the Communist Party can solve China's problems, so we should not oppose it. These two views combine to form a reason that China can swallow its conquerors, like swallowing a dose of communist tonic. The conclusion of both views is that the United States need not worry. Although the CCP's weaknesses do not mean that we can ignore it, defeating it is not absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>The CCP's first obvious weakness is that communism cannot gain a large number of party members in cities, and cannot even seize important cities by force. The Communist Party's success is almost entirely limited to rural areas. They have never occupied a larger city for a long time. However, Marxism is said to be a doctrine suitable for industrial societies, that is, cities. This seemingly contradictory argument has two major reasons. The first reason is the existence of a state of civil war. In this state, even a weaker force can occupy remote areas and appear to be occupied for a long time, but it cannot occupy cities that can be reached by large armies. The second reason is the nature of the cities themselves.</p>
<p>The social and economic organization of Chinese cities is a complex mixture of old guilds (trade associations) and modern new facilities. Guilds are professional groups, whose members include old masters, employees, and apprentices, similar to the guilds of the European Middle Ages in many ways. There are also hometown associations, which unite people whose ancestral homes are in the same city. These groups aim to protect social security and promote the welfare of members, like the Freemason societies in the United States. If the organization of this kind of guild and hometown association system is strong, it can handle inland freight transportation and bear insurance responsibilities without documents. All transactions are based on honesty and credit. Although there are also things like self-interest, fraud, and usury, they are completely unique Chinese forms.</p>
<p>The Communist Party has the least power over cities organized in this way. Because labor groups have special forms, unlike the industrial unions in Europe and the United States, the Communist Party has nothing to seize. At the same time, this society with high loyalty and discipline can strike back with great force, can evade or break regulations, and can weaken the sharp weapon of bureaucratic politics, whether that bureaucratic politics is Kuomintang or Communist. The Communist Party has not gained a large number of people in these cities, so it cannot use force to control these cities.</p>
<p>The CCP's second weakness is the recent loss of its "New Democracy." Previously, the CCP could excuse its incomplete Bolshevik tactics as a neutralizing policy, rather than the product of having local power but no national power. This excuse also collapses. The changes in the scope of Chinese communism and the civil war have brought about many new problems and responsibilities, and gradually exposed the true face of its dictatorship.</p>
<p>These weaknesses do not mean that communism cannot win in China, but that it can only win by force. The view that stubborn peasants may defeat communism is still a dream. The Communist Party knows how to divide opposing classes and groups, and knows how to use the death penalty as an effective way to eliminate opposition.</p>
<p>The CCP's biggest weakness lies in the fact that it is helpless to solve several basic problems in China. China, unlike the Soviet Union, does not have vast land to accommodate the increasing population. It cannot solve its food problem by immigrating to border areas. It cannot purge dissidents and exile them to vast areas. China cannot sacrifice its current happiness to cultivate future war power. Once the Communist Party seizes power, it can only maintain its power by collectivization. In other words, the Communist Party must smash all existing Chinese economic organizations, must smash rural organizations and implement collectivization, and cause the civil war to spread to every village, as happened in Soviet Russia. This method cannot be implemented in a country with a huge population like China.</p>
<p>The Communist Party can only adopt the Soviet method, that is, the method of sacrificing the welfare of the people to accumulate capital, in order to build China's industry. Unless the Soviet Union completely changes its arms economy, it cannot provide economic assistance to other countries. American capital can give China the foundation for developing domestic capital. This is not force diplomacy, but raising the living standards of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned weaknesses of the CCP do not mean that communism cannot win or gain power, nor does it mean that if communism wins in China, it cannot win in Southeast Asia. These weaknesses indicate that if communism wins in China, the loss of life will be uncountable; at the same time, they indicate that if the world has sufficient skills and determination, there is still hope of preventing this loss, and this hope is based on certain facts.</p>
<p>V. The Importance of China</p>
<p>A. China's Position in World Strategy</p>
<p>"The center of the world trend has gradually shifted to China. Anyone who understands this old country—in social, political, economic, and religious aspects—can answer the politics of the next five hundred years."</p>
<p>—US Secretary of State John Hay</p>
<p>Regarding China's strategic importance, it is sometimes discussed in terms of controlling the China Sea, or the bombing distance from various parts of China to various target areas, or the storage of military manpower. The scope of these discussions is too narrow.</p>
<p>Based on current speculations, the fate of the world in the second half of the twentieth century may develop as follows: At the end of this century, it may be a Soviet world; it may still be a non-communist world; or it may have been a world war.</p>
<p>The future fate of the world is tied to two major living systems, each represented by a powerful founder. We often overlook that the total number of people actually living under these two systems is only 600 million, accounting for about 28% of the total human population. Only this part of humanity can we say that their political system is communist or democratic. There are still 1.5 billion people who do not have much impact on the current balance, their politics only have the prototype of democracy, their economic situation is relatively backward, their use of natural forces is less common, and their productivity other than agriculture is far below the level of the modern West.</p>
<p>This group of people faces several general problems, and the way these problems are handled will determine the path they should take. Communism provides a simpler solution, industrial progress and strong political organization, but deliberately avoids the most difficult problem of human freedom. This is a more accessible solution, a labor-saving and brain-saving solution.</p>
<p>It is possible to make 1.5 billion people practice democracy, and to have freedom of enterprise in the economic field without threatening the freedom of communist social development. It is impossible to make them practice communism without threatening the freedom of democratic social development. The basic doctrine of struggle as communism does not allow that. Communism cannot allow peace to exist until it has spread throughout the world. It uses tactics and strategies to weaken and divide all independent institutions. This difference is strategically significant, because democracy needs more people to help it succeed than communism. Any huge gains made by communism make the non-communist world more vulnerable to economic, political, and psychological warfare—the Cold War. This gives the Communist Party a greater advantage. If democratic countries want to avoid regular wars, they will inevitably face the fate of chronic defeat, otherwise they will engage in regular wars to make up for the losses of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Among the 1.5 billion people who can lean towards democracy or communism, China is a decisive region. Its population accounts for nearly one-third. China is not a colony of any country. In this sense, it is a free country. It may be invaded by either side, and its domestic balance can easily be overturned by any powerful intervention. Its fate will determine the fate of half of the ethnic groups in the East. (To be continued)</p>
