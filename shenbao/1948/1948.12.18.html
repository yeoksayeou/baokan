<h3>蚌宿會戰已告一段落　國軍完成新部署　南下兵團續克據點多處</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十七日電〕蚌宿會戰發展至昨日，黃兵團之突圍已吿一段落；在過去三週內，所進行之戰鬥中，國軍方面之進展，雖未能如理想之美滿，惟對華中地區劉伯承，陳賡·陳毅等部匪軍之打擊，實至深且巨，尤以黃維兵團堅守雙堆集，吸引匪之主力，而痛擊達二十日夜之久。黃兵團固已殘破，但在如此巨大之會戰中，乃係意料中事，將雙方損失作一比較，黃維·胡璉兩將軍實已完成其量艱苦之任務，與最輝煌之成果。據記者今晨所得消息，黃兵團係分三路突圍，其中兩路由胡，黃兩將軍指揮，分向東南方面行動，餘一部則由某車長率領，向西突擊，迄今晨止，除胡璉已於昨日抵蚌，並於今晨專機飛京，以及黃維之一部，尙未取得進一步之聯繫外；其向西突圍之一路，據入綏區情報，昨在蒙城渦陽一帶發現國軍之大部隊，可能卽係該部。基於戰局上此一大轉樊，李延年兵團於昨日在包家集人和集一綫，對殘匪作最後之一擊後，業以主動方式，於昨夜十二小時內，完成其轉進部署。今日起國軍在淮河南岸及淮北五河曹老集鳳台一綫，佈就陣地。淮南地區，絕無問題。李延年亦於今晨返蚌，其兵團司令部卽移來此間。迄至記者發電時止，當面匪况，尙極混亂，無法明瞭其動向。據軍方判斷，匪軍於二十日中，遭受重大打擊之後，恐已無力南進，今後匪軍如有南犯野心，則最可顧慮之處，厥為蚌埠東西兩側淮河之彎曲地帶。至於北綫杜聿明指揮下之兵團，其中除孫兵團在過去數日中，稍有挫折外，邱李兩部戰鬥力仍極堅强，並繼續南擊。聞昨晨杜曾有電致劉峙稱：如補給無問題，渠有把握獲致勝利。</p>
<p>〔聯合社蚌埠十七日電〕北上兵團節節推進，砲聲與此間愈離愈遠，市內空氣寗靜，但軍運頻繁。華中調來之第十二軍團第一批約五千名，己開到此間增援。據華東國軍司令部發言人稱：敵我兩軍芷在　河北面爭取最後五分鐘之決勝，今後共軍需要長時期之休息，方可再圖進攻。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠十七日電〕南下兵團十五日在耿莊（永城東北）·劉園（永城東）等處獲勝後，繼續向永城以東以南壓迫，昨」日間又克復劉園·張莊·小劉凹等村鎭十餘處，斃傷匪一千一百餘人，戰事正賡續進行中。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠十七日電〕軍息，國軍邱李各兵團，連日向南推進，於十七日又在劉樓擊潰匪第三縱隊，並殲匪二千餘人，匪二度增援反撲，均被擊退。又息：南下之我黃兵團與北上之李兵團會師後，今在九灣與窩河一帶，正集中兵力，配合北上之李兵團，繼續向匪攻擊中。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十七日電〕由于宿蚱戰塲重大開展，蚌埠似將置於留守地位；此間居民正以沉寂之心境，等候情勢之推移，蚌埠車站車輛擁塞·列車進出不停，軍運忙碌，外埠人士居蚌者昨晚起紛紛設法南返，記者所寓之旅館中二十四小時以來，時而客滿，時而寥落，變動極大，現僅有本報及中央社駐蚌之人員數人，又，此間戒嚴時間今日起提早自午後七時開始。</p>
<p>〔聯合社蚌埠十七日電〕華東剿匪總部之先遣隊，已開始南移至滁縣。剿匪總部軍士於昨夜開始拆除電話綫，由卡車運往車站，目前僅有一部份人員移往滁縣，南下火車中難民擁擠，攀登車頂者甚多。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕津浦南段滁縣以北沙河集管店間路軌遭匪破壞，經路局工程隊積極搶修，已於十六日晚十一時修復通車，北上客車十七日起照常開出；沿綫護路力量已加强，今後當可確保行車安全。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕聯勤總司令郭懺，農村復興委會主委蔣夢麟，十七日晨應邀出席立院，接受立委之質詢，並卽席作答。糧長關吉玉，衛生部長周詒春，軍醫署副署長陳立楷及其他高級慕僚多人亦列席。此次質詢，係由於立委趙惠謨，羅衡在徐蚱勞軍之見聞所引起，發言質詢者共六七人，咸集中於前綫士兵待遇及傷兵之醫護問題，包括前方士兵發餉遲緩，官兵吃不飽，米質過劣，副食費數額過少，前方軍運無汽車，而後方軍車運傢件行李，傷兵乏人照應，醫藥缺乏，軍醫人負不足，重傷者多因此犧牲，運至後方者，亦無適當房屋收容，以火車運兵，竟用敞車殊不人道等等。趙惠謨且自前方帶回米樣一包，請郭氏過目。</p>
<p>郭氏對各委意見　表示慚愧而感動</p>
<p>郭懺答覆時，對各委員之意見表示慚愧而感動，郭氏稱：提高前方士氣，需要後方努力，聯勤總部有對不住將士及傷兵之處，以後當提高警覺性，充分準備改良。郭氏繼就發餉手續，食米良竄，副食費額等分別解答，發餉係向財部領款，規定每月餉金至遲下月五日以前發淸，食米係由糧部交來，騐收時原有標準，此次因係催交過急，故有劣米六千大包。郭氏承認趙氏帶回之米樣不合標準。渠並謂，聯勤部曾請改發熟米，但未蒙核准。副食費自十二月起，已增至每月五十元，傷兵另加菜金，以利營養。</p>
<p>改善傷兵之待遇　盼發動民衆協助</p>
<p>關於傷兵問題，係由軍醫署副署長陳立楷作答，陳氏指出，目前軍醫人員設備醫藥均感不足，傷兵待遇亦欠佳，改善之道，惟有發動民衆，改善傷兵之運輸，發動全國醫學院師生，協助後方醫院，發動國防醫學院師生到前方工作。至醫藥器材，本月底或下月初美援到達時，可能獲得一批。陳並指出，最重要者為經費不足，請立委支持增加。</p>
<p>農村復興委員會　蔣夢麟稱未遷穗</p>
<p>對於農村復興委會之質詢，各委員着重於該會之機構工作經費等，並指摘該會竟先政府而遷廣州之事實，蔣夢麟答覆時，已近散會時間，但仍延長半小時，蔣氏對該會之性質及工作解釋甚詳。渠稱：該會係協助政府及社會機構，復興農村，與各地政府及社會團體合作，該會本身非一執行機構，經費共二千七百五十萬美元，係以美援物資出售而得，其中僅二百五十萬美元為其行政開支之用。蔣氏謂，該會在後方各地均有機構，我方委員三人，現有二人在京，該會並未遷往慶州。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕美國經濟合作總署中國分署十七日發表，經合總署署長霍夫曼十二月十三日於上海花旗總會記者招待會中問答記錄，全文如下：</p>
<p>（問）閣下以為在共黨政府或聯合政體下，經合署之純粹救濟工作，可以有機會繼續否？‘</p>
<p>（答）此項廣泛的問題殊難回答，除非我人確實明白繼任之聯合政府的形態，否則余殊不知將來應該如何？余意倘使是代表全體人民的聯合政府，則余將建議繼續救濟，惟余之建議將被接受與否，則余不知，余將作此建議。倘使表面是聯合政府，而完全操縱於共黨，則余以為我人之政府不致贊成此項援助之繼續。</p>
<p>余對於上述問題將再加一間接的回答，卽成立經合署之基本概念，由國務卿馬歇爾於去年六月五日在哈佛大學演講時述及。當時馬氏云：「我人之政策，並非針對任何國家或主義，但係針對飢餓，貧窮，困頓及混亂，其宗旨應為世界上正常經濟情形之復蘇，俾產生可以容存目由制度之政治社會狀態」。假使將來成立之政府有容許自由制度繼續存在之情况時，余認為我政府將願意接受繼續援助之建議。</p>
<p>（問）請問主要之宗旨係幫助政府抑幫助人民？</p>
<p>（答）此問甚屬簡易，經合署之主要宗旨係幫助人民，再則余以為惟一可使我人停止者，乃為假使吾人相信未來之政府將奴役其人民，則繼續援助目將失去其意義。若容許自由制度繼續存在及容許人民維持目由之情勢不變，則余以為援助之經我人監督其用途者，將繼續存在。</p>
<p>（問）余以為欲確定聯合政府是否眞正代表人民，須經過相當之時間，閣下是否以為在該段時間內援助，可在有條件之狀態下進行，例如新聞自由及自由敎育制廣。</p>
<p>（答）此項問題之答覆是；假使在該段時間內，吾人不能確定聯合政府之是否容許自由制度存在及允許人民自由，—在此段時間內，吾人準將建議繼續援助，共條件與現在存在的相同。</p>
<p>（問）根據閣下所聞，何種聯合政府將被接受？易言之，在共黨占據百分之五十一的內閣位置並包括內閣總理在內的聯合政府，是否可以接受？</p>
<p>（答）余殊不信可以計算尺來衡量政府，君等只能等候，然後自實際行動上來確定政府之性質，易言之，吾人之旨趣，乃在政府之是否容許自由人民之保持自由，倘使新政府開如有實行共黨之慣技，如禁止言論自由，集會自由，清算敵人，則吾人之答復將為「否」，在另一方面假使新政府成立後，吾人不能立卽明暸其性質—假使新政府允許我人認為對於保存自由主要之情形繼續存在，則就吾人範圍內仍將繼續援助，余並將以下列事項相吿，作為參考，目前吾人所執行之計劃，將於明年四月完畢，因此吾人所討論者僅為今後三四個月內所做之事，此對於吾政府在明年度或將通過的援助之形式，自有影響。</p>
<p>（問）宗敎自由是否將認為條件中之主要項目？</p>
<p>（答）此問甚善，因殊易作答也。其答覆無疑的是「是」。我人當不致於與壓制宗教自由之聯合政府合作。</p>
<p>（問）根據上述，余可否謂假使將來在政治與宗敎自由上所加之限制並不較目前為甚，則經合署將以同等程序繼續其計劃？</p>
<p>（答）余目今所見妨碍自由者厥為戒嚴令，假使將來亦僅如此，則答覆君之問題者將為「是」。（下文轉入第三版）</p>

<h3>社論　上海市民的試金石</h3>
<p>上海各界自救救國聯合會成立後，自衛特捐籌募委員會也已於十六日成立了；該會當塲議決，保衛上海市的經費暫定為三億金圓，並通過籌募特捐辦法三項：（一）自明年元旦起，本市地價稅一律增收千分之五，估計可得一億二千萬金圓；（二）對於貨物稅，亦照勞軍及冬令救濟附徵的現例，自明年一月份起，附徵自衛特捐；（三）在限價期內被封存的物資，一律徵收其十分之一，充作自衛捐。</p>
<p>保衛上海市，是上海市五百萬市民自己的事清，在「有力出力，有錢出錢」的原則之下，這三項辦法，均屬合情合理的措置，自為全市人民所樂於遵行的。</p>
<p>由於戰事的移至淮河流域，早巳使上海市民在心理上感到「火及家門」的威脅，於是一般富有均抱着「危邦不居」的哲學，紛紛高飛遠走，企圖在國外荀全性命。最近一個月來，不論是火車站，飛機塲或輪船碼頭，無處不行李山積，人湧如海；但是江亞輪的沉於海底，飛機失事消息的頻傳，又給逃難者一個當頭棒喝，使逃難者不得不鎭靜下來。原來逃難本非萬全之計，所謂「我能往，寇亦能往」，滔滔天下，到處都是一樣。何况長此流落異鄉，生活昂貴，如何維持生計，更是一個嚴重問題。因此上海各界的有識之士，一本其悲天憫人的胸懷，便發起自救救國運動，並昭示全市五百萬人民，自救之道，不在「逃」，而在於「自衛」。上海市自救救國聯合會就在這種意義之下成立的。</p>
<p>在兵荒馬亂之中，要保衛上海市五百萬市民的生命與財產，要保衛吾中國人民的自由與文化，自非空言自衛所能濟事。自救救國聯合會旣巳成立，自應積極展開工作，採取有計劃的有力量的行動。誰都知道，興辦任何事業，都是「非錢莫辦」的；尤其是自衛工作，籌組自衛團，固然需要一筆「巨款」就是在自衛團成立之前，加强警察的訓練及改善其待遇，使其更能盡保衛上海市的職資，也需要一筆相當可觀的款項。故以實際需要而論，此區區三億金圓，是絕對不敷分配的。何况籌募自衛特捐的辦法，須至明年一月份始能實行募繳，而幣値不定，物價動盪，將來三億決不够實際的需要，與其將來臨渴掘井，不如今日早作綢繆之計。</p>
<p>再以這三項籌募辦法的本身而膾，在原則上合情合理，無可批評，但是上海人的奮起共同保衛上海市，，五百萬市民首應有風雨同舟和衷共濟的精神，唯有「有錢出錢，有力出力」，始能使目前的危局轉危為安。所以年輕力壯的市民，固須羣起投效，踴躍參加自衛團，直接負起保衛上海市的任務，而在富有者，更應據慨解　，爭先捐輸，須知自衛乃是自己的事情，「覆巢之下焉有完卵」，與其將來傾家蕩產，不如今日以一部份財產貢獻地方，而獲得自己生命財產的保障。誠如地方協會會畏杜月笙氏所說：「過去籌募都是救別人，但這次籌捐却是為了救自己」！所以籌募自衛特捐，不當以市民大衆為對象，而應該特別由富有階級多負一些經濟責任。此次三項辦法，不免有美中不足之感。我們希望上海富有的市民能自動獻捐鉅款，充作自衛經費，以振奮土海的人心，而補這三項辦法的缺陷。</p>
<p>要之，保衛上海市是全市五百萬市民自己的事情，現正展開第一步的工作——籌募自衛經費，能不能立即獲得圓滿的結果，不僅為上海市民自衛工作的前途所繫，而且也是上海市民是否眞正覺悟，是否眞能自救救國的試金石！</p>
<h3>北大又面臨災難　胡適自認「逃兵」　在京校友校慶會中沉痛致詞</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕胡適校長十七日下午三時出席京北大同學會所籌辦之北大五十校慶大會，並發表沉痛演詞。慶祝會於中央研究院禮堂舉行，到有校友二百餘人，禮堂正面懸蔡元培遺像，佈置簡單，首由胡氏致詞。胡氏之報吿，一再說明渠如一逃兵，不能與多災多難之學校同度艱危。胡氏並頌揚前北大校長蔣夢麟氏民廿年接辦北大時，於多災多難中去舊革新之精神，及其後支撑九一八事變後局面之偉大，而此次又面臨災難，渠本人則已如一逃兵，且稱「乃一不名譽之逃兵」，聲淚俱下，與會者幾同聲一哭。繼由蔣夢麟氏致詞，蔣氏以誠懇謙遜態度，致簡短之辭，且不事推測，言及將來，則以「盡在不言中」五字稱之。蔣氏語音沉重。旋由傳斯年氏致詞，以北大五十年歷史創造自由主義成新的精神為基礎，認為過去雖未能獲得現政府之扶助，但未來共產主義如有所成就，對自由主義將更摧殘，但傳氏確信共產黨決不至支持長久，在共產黨而後必有一偉大之「朝代」，能就吾五十年來培養之自由主義種子，予以發揚。傳氏自稱悲觀，但竟以樂觀言之，博得多數人破涕為笑。旋復由朱家驊，狄膺致詞後，卽至隔室痛飲佳釀，據校友會報吿，所備佳釀共計百斤，但願狂飲，不欲剩餘，又，十七日除為校慶紀念外，同時亦為胡校長誕辰，諸校友今日飲此之意，一為校慶，一為傅斯年之樂觀者壽，再一卽為胡校長壽，一時杯觴交錯，極盡歡洽，至六時始散。</p>

<h3>霍夫曼答問紀錄　（上方交第一版）</h3>
<p>（問）此項討論，是否包括工業援助並救濟計劃？</p>
<p>（答）目前吾人正向工業建設之若干計劃前進，吾人在進一層了解中國朱來之情形前，余不信吾人將贊成長期計劃。</p>
<p>（問）請問何種司徒立門計劃業已因最近共黨之勝利而取消？</p>
<p>（賴樸翰氏簽）余不能確憶工業復興與捕充計劃應用於華北，揚子江北部，揚子江南部或台灣之數目，余信君等以為吾人將在此際觀望不前。在形勢最不安定之區域內除完成瀕於竣事之初步工程視察外，當不致實行具體計劃。</p>
<p>（問）如明春中國之局勢仍與現在相似，卽國民黨仍於較弱之形勢下維持現狀，閣下是否將提議一較大之一或二年之美援計劃？</p>
<p>（答）第一點吾等須面對者乃一九四九年之第二季撥款問題，蓋現時之撥款期乃至明年四月三日為止，余必同意所謂不足撥款以繼續經合署現階段之工作，此外則余須等待矣。</p>
<p>（問）茲請再討論聯合政府之可能性及經合署將要求之條件，此項條件是否將列成明白合約，由新政府簽署，於此明白合約內，是否將包括保證人民自由及需要經合署之繼續工作？是否將請求新政府擬訂該項明白合約？</p>
<p>（答）吾等之糧食計劃，正在六大都市中展開，故吾等可明白談及六大都市，若使任何一都市由國民政府之統治下移轉到聯合政府之統治，該聯合政府恐難在眞義上成為一合法之政府，如此則吾等決不致於與其簽訂正式之合約，吾等所將進行者，僅以備忘錄聲明吾等可能繼續援助之條件，而此條件亦卽與現行之條件相同。</p>
<p>（問）若出現一國民黨聯合政府，則是否將有同樣條件之要求？</p>
<p>（答）若聯合政府乃現政府之合法承繼者，余意彼將承受現政府之一切責任，如是則無須新合約，若將為一所謂非法的聯合政府，則吾等將與各地方進行基於特殊性質之談判。</p>
<p>（問）從閣下所得之報導，閣下認為聯合政府之可能性如何？閣下以為可能否？</p>
<p>（答）經合署之工作限於經濟，如司徒大使願意答覆君等之政治問題則甚善，今日無軍事家出席，吾等不能回答軍事問題。</p>
<p>（問）大使將作何說？</p>
<p>（答）無。</p>
<p>（問）聞下是否將因軍事局勢或工業原因而更改船隻之路綫？據余所知，將有七艘船隻於今後數週中抵津。</p>
<p>（答）余之回答可分下列二點：（一）現今未有船隻裝運任何供給工業計劃用之物資或原料駛來中國，工業計劃仍在擬定中。（二）吾等現時不擬將裝有糧食或原料之船隻更改路綫。</p>
<p>（問）萬一上海或南京失陷，閣下是否計劃將經合分署遷移他處？</p>
<p>（賴樸翰氏答）此時乃一須密切注意之時期，吾等未嘗作任何肯定之計劃。</p>
<p>（問）今認為在華經合分署人員曾行使吾人以為超出該署職權外之工作，如於十一月終上海糧荒時，彼等所行之揹施及協助運煤等，彼等之措旅同為優越者，閣下願意批評否？</p>
<p>（答）當余指派賴樸翰氏為經合總署第一個分署署長時，余卽知渠將有時作不平常之舉措，以實踐本署協助此等城市之人民的宗旨，余知余或將因賴氏之不盡遵守條例而在華盛頓受到麻煩，惟此乃不重要者，渠在此所為，雖偶有逾越法案之規定者，而均與職責相符，渠之措施，吾人不但加以贊成，而且甚表嘉許。（完）</p>

<h3>外匯證回小</h3>
<p>外匯移轉證書，昨市轉疲，晨開五十五元半，買戶見低有吸略升，曾高至五十七元五，賣方斯時紛紛欲求脫手，又吿回挫，五十五元收市。又僑匯牌價，昨仍為五十六元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自僑匯申請輸入生產器材及原料辦法公佈後，因戰局關係，數週來無人問津，僅上星期收到申請書一件，據一般觀察，在大局穩定之前，僑匯回國投資殊少可能云。</p>

<p>棉布晨開呈疲軟之勢，人心不振，四方一片賣出聲，迨至近午，因粵漢諸帮逢低採購不寂，市價始見回振，結果與前日大多未有變動。</p>
<p>初開龍頭細布四七〇元，旋以供勢甚為猛烈，喊價愈見鬆落，惟自低見四四五元後，卽步而堅檔，最高曾接近五〇〇元關，收市為四九〇元，與上日軋平。五福細布微好五元。</p>

<h3>出口貨無人收購　輸出貿易額遽减</h3>
<p>據進出口業消息：邇來正為猪鬃·桐油·腸衣等出口貨新貨上市之時，亦為出口商收購上項出口貨最旺期，在往年出口商均紛紛派員前往各地產區，擴大收購，惟在今年收購情形相反，出口商幾無人收購此項出口貨，究其原因有三：</p>
<p>（一）因戰火有一部份產區已被淪為戰區，無法再派員前往收購　。</p>
<p>前較安全之產區，僅重慶·萬縣等地區，但在收購後，無交通工具，運載來滬，輪船被徵作軍運者甚多，軍運又忙過客運，無暇顧及貨運。</p>
<p>（三）運來滬後，若一時難於脫手，又担心其安全問題，由於出口貨無人收購影響，目前出口貿易遽减。往年此時，外商來滬訂貨者甚多，目前外商等因無法訂得，均紛紛停止來滬，訂貨出口前途，又受一次打擊云。</p>

<h3>Beiping Defense War Gradually Unfolds: All Bandits at Nanyuan Airport and Outside Deshengmen Annihilated; Rumor States That Zuoyi Expressed Determination to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 17th] Fierce battles are taking place today on the southeast and west sides of the Beiping suburbs. The National Army has made considerable gains in its offensives on the east and west fronts. At 10:00 AM, about 300 scattered bandits were discovered near the Wanzi area of Nanyuan Airport. National Army troops stationed in the southern suburbs went to suppress them, and after two hours of fierce fighting, all of the bandits were annihilated. There is no trace of bandits at Nanyuan Airport. Another unit of the National Army launched an attack towards the Wanshou Temple area on the morning of the 17th, engaging in battle on the west side of the area. The fighting was fierce from morning to noon. At 10:00 AM, over a thousand bandits took advantage of a gap to flee to the vicinity of ten or so miles outside Deshengmen. A unit of the National Army surrounded the bandits, and after fierce fighting until 1:00 PM, the majority of the bandits were annihilated. They fled westward, and the National Army's field artillery units pursued them with firepower. Furthermore, a joint force of the National Army's infantry, cavalry, and artillery launched a combined encirclement operation last night towards the southeast of Pingdong, Tongxian, and the arc of the north and south of Majuqiao. They engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits west of Tongxian and northwest of Majuqiao throughout the night. This morning, the land and air forces coordinated to continue a fierce pursuit. By 1:00 PM, the bandits' momentum was broken, and the National Army had advanced to the outskirts of Tongxian. It is reported that the bandits attacking Beiping are the 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 11th columns of Lin Biao's forces. The 5th and 8th columns are in Pingdong, and the 4th, 11th, and 7th columns are in the western suburbs of Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 17th] The military situation around Tianjin is becoming increasingly tense. Small groups of bandits have been discovered both north and south of Tianjin, and a battle could break out at any moment. The situation in Tanggu remains stable. The train service between Tianjin and Tanggu is running smoothly as usual. Train service north of Tianjin is still running to Yangcun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The Political Warfare Department of the North China剿總 has just released the following comprehensive battle report for the Beiping suburbs on the 17th: In defense of the Beiping suburbs, the National Army lured the bandit forces closer to the city suburbs, and the main force is gradually launching decisive battles. Today, the entire front launched attacks in separate directions, killing and wounding over 4,000 bandits, inflicting a significant blow on the bandits and achieving fruitful results. From morning to dusk, the suburbs echoed with artillery fire throughout the day, fully demonstrating the intensity of the fighting. In the northwest of the city, a part of the bandit's 5th column first conducted probing activities towards Wanshou Temple, Hongguoyuan, Baishiqiao, and other places. The National Army immediately pursued and suppressed them, and the majority of the bandit forces were annihilated. In the afternoon, the main force of the bandits, about 5,000 men, gradually joined the battle, giving the National Army the opportunity to display its power and annihilate the bandits, launching concentrated artillery fire and fiercely bombarding them, and covering the infantry's advance. Although the bandits repeatedly launched stubborn counterattacks, they were ultimately suppressed by our intense firepower. In the Baishiqiao area east of Wanshou Temple alone, an entire bandit battalion risked death to attack, but they were all annihilated in front of our positions. It is estimated that about 1,700 bandits were killed or wounded in the northwest of the city. The battle ended victoriously in the evening. The National Army, which attacked Majuqiao in the southeast of Beiping, launched a fierce attack on the bandits with superior firepower after dawn this morning. After fierce fighting until the afternoon, over 2,000 bandits were killed or wounded. The bandits' morale wavered, and they gradually retreated. The National Army continued to fire fiercely and strike hard, and the fighting finally came to a temporary halt in the evening. Furthermore, the National Army at Nanyuan annihilated over 300 bandits near the airport this morning, ensuring the safety of the airport. Looking at the situation today, the National Army attacking in all directions has achieved significant gains. The morale of the National Army is extremely high, and they have a firm grasp of victory. They will surely make the Lin bandits who entered the pass recognize the strength of the National Army's fighting will and combat power, and lay a foundation for the National Army's future decisive battles to achieve inevitable victory.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In the fighting in the Beiping suburbs, the National Army is doing its best to protect cultural relics and historical sites, and the safety of the people, in order to avoid damage from artillery fire. However, the bandit army is actually firing artillery shells into the city. Today, the 5th column of bandit forces fought with the National Army in the Wanshou Temple area throughout the day. The bandit artillery blindly fired shells towards the ancient city. At 5:10 PM, three shells landed in the Da Houkeng area inside Fuchengmen, one after another. The first shell landed in the Xiao Gongjiang Ying, wounding a woman of about thirty years old. The second shell landed in the Dong Gongjiang Ying, but no one was injured. The third shell landed in the Xi Gongjiang Ying, wounding two soldiers from a certain unit. Other losses are still under investigation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 17th] Fu Zuoyi announced at a meeting of military and government leaders last night that he had decided to defend Beiping and Tianjin, even if it meant fighting to the last man. Fu personally instructed on military matters and measures to maintain public order. Furthermore, Ji Chairman Chu Xichun informed the people today to remain calm and not to be afraid. It is claimed that there are 120,000 regular troops and 30,000 militia in the Beiping area to undertake the defense, and there is no need to worry about food shortages. Furthermore, the 剿總 has ordered the demolition of all buildings along the city walls to prevent them from being used by the Communist army.</p>
<h3>The Bengbu-Suxian Campaign Has Come to a Temporary End; The National Army Has Completed Its New Deployment; The Southern Expeditionary Force Continues to Capture Many Strongholds</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 17th] The Bengbu-Suxian campaign developed until yesterday, and the breakout of Huang's army has come to a temporary end. Although the progress of the National Army in the battles that have taken place in the past three weeks has not been as satisfactory as desired, the blow to the bandit forces of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and Chen Yi in the Central China region has been extremely deep and significant. In particular, Huang Wei's army stubbornly defended Shuangduiji, attracting the main force of the bandits, and fiercely attacking them for as long as twenty days and nights. Huang's army has indeed been decimated, but this was to be expected in such a massive campaign. Comparing the losses on both sides, Generals Huang Wei and Hu Lian have truly completed their arduous task with the most brilliant results. According to the news I received this morning, Huang's army broke out in three directions. Two of the routes were commanded by Generals Hu and Huang, and they moved in the southeast direction. The remaining part was led by a certain vehicle commander and launched an attack to the west. As of this morning, except for Hu Lian, who arrived in Bengbu yesterday and flew to Nanjing on a special plane this morning, and a part of Huang Wei's force, no further contact has been established. According to intelligence from the Sui district, a large unit of the National Army was discovered in the Mengcheng-Guoyang area yesterday, which may be this force. Based on this major turning point in the battle situation, Li Yannian's army completed its redeployment in an active manner within twelve hours last night after launching a final strike against the remaining bandits on the Baogaji-Renheji line yesterday. Starting today, the National Army has deployed its positions on the south bank of the Huai River and on the Wuhe-Caolaoji-Fenghuai line north of the Huai River. There is absolutely no problem in the Huainan area. Li Yannian also returned to Bengbu this morning, and his army headquarters has moved here. As of the time of this dispatch, the bandit situation on the opposite side is still extremely chaotic, and it is impossible to understand their movements. According to the military's judgment, after suffering a major blow in the past twenty days, the bandit army may be unable to advance southward. If the bandit army has any ambitions to invade the south in the future, the most worrying area would be the curved areas of the Huai River on the east and west sides of Bengbu. As for the army under the command of Du Yuming on the northern front, except for Sun's army, which suffered a slight setback in the past few days, the combat effectiveness of the Qiu and Li armies is still extremely strong, and they continue to attack southward. It is heard that Du sent a telegram to Liu Zhi yesterday morning, stating that if there are no problems with supplies, he is confident of achieving victory.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bengbu, 17th] The Northern Expeditionary Force is advancing steadily, and the sound of artillery is getting farther and farther away from here. The atmosphere in the city is peaceful, but military transportation is frequent. The first batch of approximately 5,000 men from the 12th Army Corps transferred from Central China have arrived here to reinforce the defense. According to a spokesman for the East China National Army Headquarters: The two armies are fighting for the final five minutes of decisive battle on the Hebei front.

<h3>Legislators Raise Questions About Soldiers' Treatment and Wounded Soldiers' Medical Care; Guo Chan Attends the Legislative Yuan Meeting to Answer</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The Legislative Yuan held its 29th meeting of the second session on the 17th, chaired by Chen Lifu. After reporting on matters in the morning, they proceeded with inquiries, which were answered by Guo Chan, Chen Likai, Jiang Menglin, and others from the Joint Logistics Headquarters and the Rural Reconstruction Commission. In the afternoon, after passing Yao Tingfang's proposal on the method of converting gold, they began discussing matters. When voting on the articles of the draft organization law of the Ministry of Social Affairs, it was discovered that there were only 129 members present, which was less than the legal quorum. They barely passed two cases, one being the approval of the Foreign Affairs Committee's preparation for the renewal of the agreement between China and Hong Kong regarding the customs affairs of the Jishui Gate area, and the other being the retroactive approval of the declaration of temporary martial law in the jurisdiction of the Wuhu Command and between Jiangning and Dongliu. At this time, even more members had left the meeting, and there were fewer than 70 people present. The meeting could not proceed, and all cases were left for discussion at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Guo Chan, and Chairman of the Rural Reconstruction Commission Jiang Menglin, were invited to attend the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 17th to accept questions from the legislators and answer them on the spot. Food Minister Guan Jiyu, Health Minister Zhou Yichun, Deputy Director of the Military Medical Department Chen Likai, and many other senior staff members also attended. This inquiry was caused by the observations of legislators Zhao Huimo and Luo Heng during their visit to the Xuzhou battlefield. A total of six or seven people spoke and asked questions, focusing on the issues of the treatment of soldiers at the front line and the medical care of wounded soldiers, including the slow payment of salaries to soldiers at the front, the fact that officers and soldiers could not get enough to eat, the poor quality of rice, the small amount of non-staple food allowance, the lack of motor vehicles for military transportation at the front, while military vehicles in the rear transported furniture and luggage, the lack of care for wounded soldiers, the lack of medicine, the insufficient number of military doctors, the fact that many seriously wounded soldiers sacrificed as a result, the lack of suitable houses to accommodate those transported to the rear, and the inhumanity of using open cars to transport soldiers by train, and so on. Zhao Huimo even brought back a bag of rice samples from the front and asked Guo to take a look.</p>
<p>Guo Expressed Shame and Emotion at the Opinions of the Committee Members</p>
<p>In his reply, Guo Chan expressed shame and emotion at the opinions of the committee members. Guo stated that improving the morale of the front line requires the efforts of the rear. The Joint Logistics Headquarters has let down the soldiers and wounded soldiers, and in the future, it should raise its vigilance, fully prepare, and improve. Guo then answered questions separately on salary payment procedures, the quality of rice, and the amount of the non-staple food allowance. He stated that salary payments are made by receiving funds from the Ministry of Finance, and it is stipulated that monthly salaries must be paid in full by the 5th of the following month at the latest. The rice is delivered by the Ministry of Food, and there were standards for acceptance. This time, because the rice was rushed, there were 6,000 large bags of inferior rice. Guo admitted that the rice sample brought back by Zhao did not meet the standards. He also said that the Joint Logistics Department had requested that cooked rice be issued, but this was not approved. The non-staple food allowance has been increased to 50 yuan per month since December, and wounded soldiers have been given an additional food allowance to improve nutrition.</p>
<p>Hoping to Improve the Treatment of Wounded Soldiers by Mobilizing Public Assistance</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of wounded soldiers, Deputy Director of the Military Medical Department Chen Likai answered. Chen pointed out that the current medical personnel, equipment, and medicines are all insufficient, and the treatment of wounded soldiers is also poor. The only way to improve is to mobilize the public, improve the transportation of wounded soldiers, mobilize the faculty and students of medical colleges across the country to assist hospitals in the rear, and mobilize the faculty and students of the National Defense Medical College to work at the front. As for medical equipment and supplies, a batch may be obtained when US aid arrives at the end of this month or early next month. Chen also pointed out that the most important thing is the lack of funding, and asked the legislators to support an increase.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang Menglin of the Rural Reconstruction Commission Said that it has not Moved to Guangzhou</p>
<p>Regarding the inquiries to the Rural Reconstruction Commission, the committee members focused on the commission's organizational structure, work, and funding, and criticized the fact that the commission moved to Guangzhou before the government. Jiang Menglin replied that it was close to adjournment time, but the meeting was extended by half an hour. Jiang explained the nature and work of the commission in detail. He stated that the commission assists the government and social organizations in reconstructing rural areas and cooperates with local governments and social organizations. The commission itself is not an executive agency. The total funding is US$27.5 million, which is obtained from the sale of US aid materials, of which only US$2.5 million is used for its administrative expenses. Jiang said that the commission has organizations in various places in the rear. There are three of our members, and two are currently in the capital. The commission has not moved to Qingzhou.</p>
<h3>The Change of Policy on Gold Conversion is Severely Damaging to Credibility</h3>
<p>Requesting the Executive Yuan to Instruct the Ministry of Finance to Reply</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The ever-changing method of redeeming gold for gold yuan deposits has attracted the attention of the legislators. At the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 17th, legislators Yao Tingfang and others proposed a temporary motion, questioning the financial authorities and the Central Bank as to why they initially allowed unlimited exchange of gold, leading to the activities of scalpers, and then changed it to a limit of five taels. This method was implemented for only one day, and then it was changed to a limit of one tael. The financial authorities are contradicting themselves and changing their policies frequently, how can they gain the trust of the people? Nothing is more damaging to the government's credibility than this. The President of the Central Bank should be asked to come to the Legislative Yuan to answer. After discussion at the meeting, it was decided to change it to an inquiry case and request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to sign and reply.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] There is no date for the announcement of Sun Ke's cabinet list, and the government affairs of the Executive Yuan are on the verge of stagnation. The Vice President, Zhang Lisheng, has been acting as the agent for more than a month, and Sun has also sent Counselor Qu Dingxin to reside in the Yuan to act as the agent for some of his duties.

The Weng cabinet originally planned to hold its last temporary political affairs meeting on the 10th as a conclusion, but as of midnight on the 17th, this meeting notice has not yet been sent out, and it may not be held again, waiting quietly for the new cabinet to be formed to handle important official matters.

<h3>Hoffman's Answers in Shanghai Press Conference</h3>
<p>[This City News] The China Division of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) released on the 17th the record of questions and answers at a press conference held by ECA Administrator Hoffman at the Shanghai Citibank Main Building on December 13th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Does Your Excellency believe that purely relief work by the ECA can have a chance to continue under a communist government or a coalition government?</p>
<p>(Answer) This broad question is difficult to answer unless we clearly understand the form of the successor coalition government. Otherwise, I don't know what should happen in the future. I think that if it is a coalition government representing all the people, then I will recommend continuing relief. However, I do not know whether my recommendation will be accepted. I will make this recommendation. If it is a coalition government in name only, but completely controlled by the communists, then I don't think our government will approve the continuation of this aid.</p>
<p>I will add an indirect answer to the above question, that is, the basic concept of establishing the ECA, which was mentioned by Secretary of State Marshall in his speech at Harvard University on June 5 last year. At that time, Mr. Marshall said: "Our policy is not directed against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, distress and chaos, and its purpose should be the recovery of the normal economic situation in the world, so as to produce a political and social state that can tolerate the system of freedom." If the government to be established in the future allows the continued existence of the system of freedom, I believe that my government will be willing to accept the recommendation to continue assistance.</p>
<p>(Question) May I ask whether the main purpose is to help the government or help the people?</p>
<p>(Answer) This question is very simple. The main purpose of the ECA is to help the people. Furthermore, I think the only thing that can make us stop is if we believe that the future government will enslave its people, then continuing aid will lose its meaning. If the situation of allowing the continued existence of the system of freedom and allowing the people to maintain freedom remains unchanged, then I believe that the aid whose purpose is supervised by us will continue to exist.</p>
<p>(Question) I think it will take a considerable amount of time to determine whether the coalition government truly represents the people. Does Your Excellency think that aid can be carried out conditionally during that period, such as freedom of the press and widespread free education?</p>
<p>(Answer) The answer to this question is: if during that period, we cannot determine whether the coalition government allows the existence of a free system and allows the freedom of the people – during this period, we will recommend continued assistance, with the same conditions as exist now.</p>
<p>(Question) Based on what you have heard, what kind of coalition government will be accepted? In other words, is a coalition government in which the Communist Party occupies 51% of the cabinet positions and includes the Prime Minister acceptable?</p>
<p>(Answer) I don't believe that governments can be measured with a ruler. You can only wait and then determine the nature of the government from its actual actions. In other words, our interest lies in whether the government allows free people to remain free. If the new government starts to implement the usual communist practices, such as prohibiting freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and liquidating enemies, then our answer will be "no." On the other hand, if after the establishment of the new government, we cannot immediately understand its nature—if the new government allows what we believe to be the main conditions for preserving freedom to continue to exist, then we will continue to provide assistance within our scope. I will also tell you the following for reference: the current plan we are implementing will be completed in April next year, so what we are discussing is only what to do in the next three to four months, which will affect the form of assistance that our government may pass in the next year.</p>
<p>(Question) Will religious freedom be considered a major item in the conditions?</p>
<p>(Answer) This question is very good because it is very easy to answer. The answer is undoubtedly "yes". We will not cooperate with a coalition government that suppresses religious freedom.</p>
<p>(Question) Based on the above, can I say that if the restrictions imposed on political and religious freedom in the future are no greater than they are now, then the ECA will continue its plan in the same procedure?</p>
<p>(Answer) What I see now that hinders freedom is martial law. If it is only like this in the future, then the answer to your question will be "yes". (The following article turns to the third edition)</p>
<h3>Hoffman Returns to the United States via Japan; Lunches with MacArthur</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Administrator Hoffman declared on the 17th that his opinions on the United States' aid to China's coalition government, published in Shanghai, have been misinterpreted by some Shanghai journalists. Hoffman, after arriving here from Seoul, said that he had said too much about China's affairs. Hoffman will return to the United States by plane at 7:00 pm on the 17th after having lunch with MacArthur. He pointed out that he was deeply impressed by the progress of South Korea. No matter what happens to China in the future, the United States has a good opportunity to have a solid position in South Korea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) approved for the first time today to purchase coal and other fuels for China with US$285,000, which can be shipped from Japan to China within days.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Touchstone of Shanghai Citizens</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai All Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association, the Special Self-Defense Donation Raising Committee was also established on the 16th. The meeting then resolved that the expenses for defending Shanghai would be tentatively set at 300 million Gold Yuan, and passed three measures for raising special donations: (1) Starting from New Year's Day next year, the land price tax in this city will be increased by 5 per thousand, which is estimated to generate 120 million Gold Yuan; (2) The goods tax will also be subject to a special self-defense donation attached in accordance with the current practice of attaching military and winter relief donations from January next year; (3) Materials sealed during the price-limited period will be subject to a 1/10 levy to be used as a self-defense donation.</p>
<p>Defending Shanghai is the business of the 5 million citizens of Shanghai. Under the principle of "those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money," these three measures are all reasonable measures and will be happily followed by the people of the city.</p>
<p>As the war has shifted to the Huai River Basin, the citizens of Shanghai have long felt the threat of "fire reaching their homes" psychologically. Therefore, the general wealthy people hold the philosophy of "not living in a dangerous country" and have flocked to fly far away, trying to save their lives abroad. In the past month, whether it is railway stations, airports, or wharves, there are piles of luggage and people are like the sea everywhere. However, the sinking of the Jiangya ship into the seabed and the frequent news of plane crashes have given the refugees a head start, forcing the refugees to calm down. It turns out that fleeing is not a perfect solution. As the saying goes, "I can go, and the enemy can go," the world is vast, and it is all the same everywhere. What's more, how to maintain a livelihood is a serious problem if you are displaced in a foreign country for a long time and the cost of living is expensive. Therefore, people of insight from all walks of life in Shanghai, based on their compassion, launched the self-salvation and national salvation movement and announced to the 5 million people of the city that the way to save themselves is not to "escape," but to "self-defense." The Shanghai Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association was established in this sense.</p>
<p>In the midst of war and chaos, to protect the lives and property of the 5 million citizens of Shanghai and to protect the freedom and culture of our Chinese people, it is impossible to achieve anything by merely talking about self-defense. Now that the Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association has been established, it should actively carry out work and take planned and powerful actions. Everyone knows that "nothing can be done without money" in starting any business. Especially for self-defense work, raising a "huge sum" is required to form a self-defense corps. Even before the establishment of the self-defense corps, strengthening the training of the police and improving their treatment, so that they can better fulfill their duties to protect Shanghai, also requires a considerable amount of money. Therefore, in terms of practical needs, this small amount of 300 million Gold Yuan is absolutely insufficient for distribution. What's more, the method of raising special self-defense donations will not be implemented until January next year, and the currency value is uncertain and the prices are turbulent. In the future, 300 million will definitely not be enough for actual needs. It is better to prepare for it today than to dig a well when you are thirsty in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, taking these three fund-raising methods themselves as an example, they are reasonable in principle and there is nothing to criticize. However, the people of Shanghai should rise up to jointly defend Shanghai. The 5 million citizens should first have the spirit of sharing weal and woe and working together. Only by "those who have money contribute money and those who have strength contribute strength" can the current crisis be turned into safety. Therefore, young and strong citizens must rise up to join the self-defense corps and directly assume the task of defending Shanghai, while the wealthy should generously donate money and strive to donate. It must be known that self-defense is their own business. "When the nest is overturned, there are no intact eggs." It is better to contribute a part of your property to the local area today and obtain the guarantee of your own life and property than to lose your family property in the future. As Mr. Du Yuesheng, the president of the local association, said: "In the past, fundraising was to save others, but this time, raising donations is to save ourselves!" Therefore, raising special self-defense donations should not be aimed at the general public, but should be borne more economic responsibility by the wealthy class. This time, the three measures inevitably have a sense of imperfection. We hope that the wealthy citizens of Shanghai can automatically donate huge sums of money to be used as self-defense expenses, in order to invigorate the hearts of the people of Shanghai and make up for the shortcomings of these three measures.</p>
<p>In short, defending Shanghai is the business of the 5 million citizens of the city. The first step of work is now underway - raising self-defense expenses. Whether or not it can immediately achieve satisfactory results is not only related to the future of Shanghai's self-defense work, but also the touchstone of whether the citizens of Shanghai are truly aware and whether they can truly save themselves and the country!</p>
<h3>Peking University Faces Another Disaster; Hu Shih Acknowledges Himself as a "Deserter"; Delivers a Painful Speech at the Alumni Anniversary Meeting in Beijing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] President Hu Shih attended the 50th anniversary of Peking University organized by the Peking University Alumni Association in Nanjing at 3:00 pm on the 17th and delivered a painful speech. The celebration was held in the auditorium of the Academia Sinica. More than 200 alumni attended. The portrait of Cai Yuanpei was hung on the front of the auditorium. The layout was simple. Mr. Hu gave a speech first. In Mr. Hu's report, he repeatedly stated that he was like a deserter and could not share the difficulties with the disaster-stricken school. Mr. Hu also praised the spirit of former Peking University President Jiang Menglin when he took over Peking University in the 20th year of the Republic of China, who reformed the old in the midst of disasters, and his greatness in supporting the situation after the September 18th Incident. Now he is facing another disaster, and he himself is like a deserter, and he called himself "a deserter without honor." Tears fell down, and the participants almost cried in unison. Then Jiang Menglin gave a speech. Mr. Jiang gave a brief speech with a sincere and humble attitude, and did not make any speculation. When talking about the future, he called it with the five words "everything is self-evident." Mr. Jiang's voice was heavy. Then Fu Sinian gave a speech. He believed that the 50-year history of Peking University created a new spirit of liberalism as its foundation. He believed that although it had not received the support of the current government in the past, communism would be even more destructive to liberalism if it made any achievements in the future. However, Mr. Fu firmly believed that the Communist Party would not last long, and after the Communist Party, there would be a great "dynasty" that could develop the seeds of liberalism that we have cultivated for 50 years. Mr. Fu claimed to be pessimistic, but he actually spoke optimistically, which made most people laugh through their tears. Then Zhu Jiahua and Di Ying gave speeches, and then went to the next room to drink good wine. According to the alumni association's report, a total of 100 kilograms of good wine were prepared. They only wanted to drink wildly and did not want to leave any leftovers. Also, the 17th was not only the anniversary of the school, but also President Hu's birthday. The intention of the alumni drinking today was one for the anniversary of the school, one for Fu Sinian's optimism, and one for President Hu's birthday. For a while, the cups were crossed and they were extremely happy, and they dispersed at six o'clock.</p>

According to the communique, Hatta's letter to American member Cochran of the Mediation Committee only expressed his personal opinion. If Hatta declares in a concrete manner that his government is prepared to join the federal government with other states in accordance with the conditions set by the Netherlands and these states, and proves that the Republican government is trying to stop violations of the truce agreement and the infiltration of Republican elements into Dutch territory, then a basis for reopening negotiations may be found. The Republic must make the above statement before negotiations can resume.</p>

<h3>Hoffmann's Q&amp;A Record (Above text continues from page one)</h3>
<p>(Q) Does this discussion include industrial assistance and relief plans?</p>
<p>(A) We are currently moving forward with several industrial construction plans. Before we further understand the situation in China, I do not believe that we will support long-term plans.</p>
<p>(Q) What kind of Stettinius plans have been cancelled due to the recent communist victory?</p>
<p>(By John Leighton Stuart) I cannot remember exactly the number of industrial restoration and replenishment plans that apply to North China, north of the Yangtze River, south of the Yangtze River, or Taiwan. I believe you think we will wait and see at this moment. In the most unstable areas, except for completing the preliminary engineering inspections that are nearing completion, specific plans will not be implemented.</p>
<p>(Q) If the situation in China next spring is still similar to the present, that is, the Kuomintang still maintains the status quo in a weaker situation, will you propose a larger one or two-year US aid plan?</p>
<p>(A) The first thing we must face is the issue of appropriations for the second quarter of 1949, because the current appropriation period lasts until April 3 next year. I must agree that the appropriations are insufficient to continue the work of the ECA at this stage, and I must wait.</p>
<p>(Q) Please discuss the possibility of a coalition government and the conditions that the ECA will require. Will these conditions be listed in a clear contract and signed by the new government? Will this clear contract include guarantees of people's freedom and the need for the ECA to continue its work? Will the new government be asked to draft this clear contract?</p>
<p>(A) Our food program is being launched in six major cities, so we can talk clearly about the six major cities. If any city is transferred from the rule of the National Government to the rule of the coalition government, it may be difficult for the coalition government to become a legitimate government in the true sense, so we will never sign a formal contract with it. What we will do is only declare in a memorandum the conditions under which we may continue to provide assistance, and these conditions are the same as the current conditions.</p>
<p>(Q) If a National Party coalition government appears, will the same conditions be required?</p>
<p>(A) If the coalition government is a legitimate successor to the current government, I believe it will assume all the responsibilities of the current government, so there is no need for a new contract. If it is a so-called illegal coalition government, we will negotiate with the local governments based on special circumstances.</p>
<p>(Q) From the reports you have received, what do you think is the possibility of a coalition government? Do you think it is possible?</p>
<p>(A) The work of the ECA is limited to the economy. It would be great if Ambassador Stuart is willing to answer your political questions. No military personnel are present today, and we cannot answer military questions.</p>
<p>(Q) What will the ambassador say?</p>
<p>(A) Nothing.</p>
<p>(Q) Will the shipping routes be changed due to the military situation or industrial reasons? As far as I know, seven ships will arrive in Tianjin in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>(A) My answer can be divided into the following two points: (1) No ships are currently transporting any materials or raw materials for the industrial plan to China, and the industrial plan is still being formulated. (2) We do not intend to change the routes of ships carrying food or raw materials at this time.</p>
<p>(Q) In case Shanghai or Nanjing falls, do you plan to move the ECA branch elsewhere?</p>
<p>(John Leighton Stuart replied) This is a time that requires close attention, and we have not made any definite plans.</p>
<p>(Q) It is now believed that the ECA personnel in China have exercised work that we believe is beyond the scope of the agency's authority, such as the measures they took and the assistance they provided in transporting coal during the Shanghai famine at the end of November. Your views are all excellent. Are you willing to comment?</p>
<p>(A) When I appointed John Leighton Stuart as the first director of the ECA branch, I knew that he would sometimes take unusual measures to fulfill the agency's purpose of helping the people of these cities. I know that I may encounter trouble in Washington because John Leighton Stuart does not fully comply with the regulations, but this is not important. What he has done here, although occasionally exceeding the provisions of the law, is in line with his duties. We not only approve of his measures, but also express our appreciation. (The End)</p>

<h3>Bank Clearinghouse Settlement Delayed by One Day</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The next application for gold and silver exchange in the city was originally scheduled to be issued on the 21st. However, due to the 20th being the bank clearinghouse settlement date and a halt to external operations, the final exchange period for the application issued the day before yesterday has been extended.

<h3>City Industrial Association Directors Request Simplification of Industrial Loan Issuance Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Industrial Association stated that although industrial loans have been approved by the Central Bank's Subsidy Committee, the stipulated procedures are too strict.

Yesterday morning, Standing Directors Hu Xiyuan, Hong Nianzu, and others visited President Yu of the National Bank and Secretary-General Chong Yong of the Subsidy Committee, requesting simplification of the procedures for issuing industrial loans and purchasing finished products, and urging all banks and clearinghouses to universally accept applications to rescue the industrial crisis. According to the Industrial Association, Secretary-General Lin of the Subsidy Committee verbally promised four points: (1) Regarding the acceptance of loan and finished product purchase applications by national banks, in the past, due to limited contact, the applications of various factories have not yielded results. The Subsidy Committee has decided to notify all banks that any application for industrial loans and finished product purchases must be accepted without refusal, and all commercial banks should make efforts to assist and facilitate the process. (2) Special attention will be given to applications from small and medium-sized factories. (3) Procedures for purchasing finished products can be simplified. The originally required balance sheets and profit and loss statements do not need to be completed. Products that meet the regulations will be purchased, and those that do not can be converted into loans. The purchase price will not be lowered. (4) For various industries with overproduction and complex manufacturing, loans can still be provided in addition to purchasing their finished products.</p>

Yesterday, they dispatched personnel to the China Bank, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to review accounts. Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi stated that the Nanjing Supervisory Yuan is also paying close attention to this case.

<h3>Mother Dies Unnaturally; Apprentice Jumps to His Death</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yu Sanhua, a 22-year-old apprentice at the Shun Kang Money Exchange at No. 6, Lane 157, Tianjin Road, received news that his mother had died unnaturally.

He was taken to Renji Hospital by street police, where he died at around 9 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Universities and Colleges Return to Shanghai After Appealing Regarding the Price of Newsprint</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wang Yukai, the president of Guangxia Commercial College, who was dispatched by private universities and colleges in the city to appeal to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing regarding the price of newsprint foreign exchange quotas, returned to Shanghai yesterday. The Ministry of Education has decided to send Xu Weizhu, an assistant from the General Affairs Department, to Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Bank. In October of this year, the Ministry of Education instructed all universities and colleges that the required newsprint had been arranged with the Import Control Committee, with foreign exchange quotas set according to the number of students in each school. At that time, four gold yuan equaled one U.S. dollar. Later, the government adjusted the exchange rate to 20 gold yuan per U.S. dollar, and now the exchange requires 48 yuan. The presidents of the various schools believe that if they settle the accounts at this rate, the price of the newsprint will be more expensive than the current market price. The schools paid the money to Defeng Foreign Firm in early November to handle the matter, and it is now impossible to get a refund. They must settle the accounts at the price of 48 yuan, which is unreasonable, hence the dispatch of a representative to Nanjing to appeal to the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Lieutenant Aide-de-Camp Captured; Wife Meets with Accident; Orderly, with Evil Intent, Steals Luggage and Flees</h3>

His wife, Sun Ruxin, accompanied by an orderly named Zhao and carrying luggage, came to Shanghai to visit her mother and younger siblings in Qingdao. Unfortunately, they arrived in port the night before last during curfew and had to spend the night in the North Station. After dawn, they checked into the Renhe Hotel on Yongshou Road. As soon as Sun put down her luggage, she asked Zhao to buy a stone of rice to take to Qingdao. Later, in the afternoon, she asked Zhao to accompany her to the barber shop for a haircut. Zhao had an evil idea and took the opportunity to sneak back to the hotel, pack up the luggage, and run away. When Sun returned and discovered what had happened, she was like a yellow crane that vanished. A wicker basket containing two taels of pure gold, 2,000 yuan in cash, and other clothing and items had also been stolen. She couldn't help but feel sadness from within and burst into tears. The hotel authorities ordered someone to accompany her to the Songshan Road Police Station to report the incident. As of midnight, the police were still dispatching personnel to investigate.</p>

<h3>Second Inspection of Jiangya Ship; Two Judges Return Late at Night; Divers Report Explosion Seemed to Originate from Inside</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The District Prosecutor's Office has assigned prosecutors Cao Hong and Yu Bingquan to investigate the responsibility for the Jiangya ship disaster. Prosecutors Cao and Yu took the China Merchants Bureau's Jianlun ship to the accident site off Wusongkou on the morning of the 14th, but returned without results due to strong winds and waves. Yesterday, they went to inspect the site again. Those who accompanied them were lawyers Yu Shun, Zheng Lin, Tong Xia, Gongkai, Wang Peiji from the Ningbo Association legal group, Zhou Qifan from the Salvage Group, Zhang Jinde, Chief Engineer of the China Merchants Bureau, Fan Lun, Head of the Maritime Affairs Section, Hu Jiaxin, Business Director, lawyer Tong Jingkui from the Shaoxing Association legal group, Cao Liangqing, representative of the Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, representatives from the Marine Engineer and Driving Association, and a group of reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than 30 people. They departed on the Jianlun ship at 8:10 a.m. and arrived at the Jiangya ship accident site at around 12:00 noon. Divers went underwater to search the sunken ship. According to the divers, the bottom of the ship was intact, and the explosion occurred at the stern, appearing to have originated from inside the ship. The prosecutors also went aboard the deck of the Jiangya ship above the sea to inspect the ground. They also retrieved two pieces of exploded iron from the ship in the water as a reference for the investigation. The inspection was completed at around 4:00 p.m. The group returned to the China Merchants Bureau dock at around 9:00 p.m. yesterday evening. According to the prosecutors, a hearing will be held in the coming days to question the relevant parties in the case to clarify the truth about the accident. They hope that the surviving passengers of the ship can provide eyewitness accounts to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>No Bodies Recovered for Two Days; Turns Out Divers Are on Strike</p>
<p>[Our Report] The body recovery work for the Jiangya ship disaster was originally undertaken by 150 divers jointly hired by the China Merchants Bureau and the Disaster Relief Committee, with generous compensation. However, the recovery work was inevitably slower due to the high tide, and therefore it was criticized by various parties. A few days ago, all the divers suddenly stated that they had heard on Shanghai Radio's Xiaokuaile broadcast that they were being watched too closely, making it impossible for them to get any "extra income," and therefore they were deliberately slowing down. They considered this to be intentional humiliation and stopped the recovery work, demanding that the China Merchants Bureau and the Relief Committee negotiate with the broadcaster. As a result, no sunken bodies were brought to Shanghai on the 15th and 16th.</p>
<p>Voluntarily Resumed Work Yesterday; 43 Bodies Transported</p>
<p>After the news spread, the families of the victims in the city were extremely anxious and urged the Relief Committee to send personnel to persuade them to resume work, fearing that if the recovery work was delayed any longer, the bodies at the bottom of the ship would rot. At the same time, the China Merchants Bureau also made efforts to persuade them, explaining the moral responsibilities that the divers should have. All the divers were deeply moved and voluntarily resumed work yesterday morning. As a result of the day's recovery efforts, the China Merchants Bureau recovered nine bodies, and the Relief Committee's recovery team recovered eleven bodies. In addition, sailing boats recovered 23 floating bodies along the coast, for a total of 43 bodies. By night, all of them had been transported to Shanghai, unloaded at Pier 3, and then sent by car to the Siming Guild Hall for identification.</p>
<p>Siming Guild Hall Dizang Association Offers Prayers for the Souls of Jiangya Ship Victims</p>

Every evening at 5:30 p.m., Dharma Master Yuci and Dharma Masters Ru San will set up a grand Almsgiving to the Hungry Ghosts ceremony. All expenses will be borne by the initiators of the association. Family members of the victims who wish to set up memorial tablets for prayers can register the names of the deceased at the Siming Guild Hall at No. 45, Linsen East Road, starting immediately, free of charge.</p>
<p>Japanese Engineers and Divers to Come to China to Participate in Salvage</p>
<p>It is reported that two Japanese engineers and six divers will leave Tokyo for Shanghai shortly to participate in the salvage of the Jiangya ship that was wrecked on the 12th. They are being hired by our China Merchants Bureau. The bureau has applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Allied Headquarters to complete the procedures. The manager of the China Merchants Bureau in Tokyo stated that after the Japanese engineers and divers arrive in Shanghai, they will first inspect the Jiangya ship and decide whether it can be salvaged. If the ship can be salvaged, additional divers will be dispatched from Japan, along with salvage ships and equipment, to carry out the work. He said that if approval can be obtained from the Allied Headquarters and our Ministry of Foreign Affairs as scheduled, they will take the Hailiao ship to Shanghai next week.</p>
<h3>Severe Food Shortage at Tongji University; People's Mediation Committee to Allocate More Loans</h3>
<p>Number of Students Returning Home to Study Has Not Increased</p>
<p>[Our Report] Due to the food shortage at Tongji University, students are still only eating two meals a day. More than 500 piculs of rice were allocated for December, but the People's Mediation Committee has not yet released them. After repeated urging from the school, the People's Mediation Committee sent personnel to the school yesterday to investigate the number of students. In addition to the 120 piculs that have already been loaned, several hundred more piculs will be loaned. The rice that has been eaten in the school in recent days has been purchased with funds advanced by the school, which can temporarily last until the 20th. According to President Xia Jianbai, funds have recently been remitted from the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, and the economic situation has improved slightly. As for the students who have applied to return home to study, there are already 350 people. The number has not increased in recent days because most students are watching the situation at the universities in the north before deciding whether to return home or not.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange transfer certificates weakened in the city yesterday. They opened at 55.5 yuan in the morning. Buyers saw the low price and absorbed slightly, rising to 57.5 yuan. Sellers at that time wanted to sell off, and then they fell back, closing at 55 yuan. The remittance exchange rate yesterday was still 56 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Since the promulgation of the Measures for Applying for the Import of Production Equipment and Raw Materials with Overseas Chinese Remittances, no one has been interested for several weeks due to the war situation. Only one application was received last week. According to general observations, it is unlikely that overseas Chinese will invest in the country before the overall situation stabilizes.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Recovers</h3>
<p>The sugar market was relatively stable yesterday. Local buyers slightly increased their purchases, and Hangzhou buyers also added to their holdings. Supply and sales in the market were also strong, and the asking price saw a slight increase. No. 45 Che White Refined Sugar closed at 465 yuan, a slight increase of 10 yuan. Granulated sugar and medium sugar each increased by 5 to 10 yuan. Xinghua red and Hainan red had weak buying interest. People are tired of watching, and the price saw a slight decline. The remaining supply and demand were balanced, and the trend was still strong, with a slight increase.</p>
<h3>Lively Trends in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>Regarding exported boxed tea, since the foreign exchange transfer certificates reached their peak, exporters have had remarkably smooth intake. As for domestic sales of various types, places like this street have also seen gathered purchasing power, with a trend towards activity, as money seems to be tight yet loose. Transactions could have proceeded smoothly, but because merchants believe costs are still difficult to suppress and that market inventory is low, they generally adopt a firm-selling attitude, resulting in only a few deals being made. In terms of price, it is exceptionally impressive, and the foundation can be considered optimistic. According to general observations, there is much hope.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Handling Procedures for Goods Import Applications by the Import Management Office</h3>
<p>Recently, the person in charge of the non-quota import department of the Import and Export Control Commission stated that regarding the Category A goods import applications approved and issued approval notices before September 30 of this year, and the Category C goods import applications that have been approved but have not yet been issued approval notices, there may be a lack of clarity from the outside world regarding how these matters will be handled. Therefore, a special explanation is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) For applications with approval notices issued before September 30, the government's emergency financial and economic measures and related decrees issued due to the implementation of currency system reforms did not explicitly state whether foreign exchange for Category A in Annexes (1) and (3) would be supplied as usual. The Executive Yuan was consulted for instructions. Subsequently, an order was received from the Yuan approving the usual supply. However, due to limited foreign exchange quotas, it was insufficient to issue the accumulated approval applications from the past. Contact was made with the National Bank to allocate additional foreign exchange for distribution. Because this process took time, after reaching an agreement, issuance began in November according to priority procedures and application order, and it is still ongoing.</p>
<p>(2) The issuance procedures stipulated by the department prioritize handling special cases for public utilities and those with time sensitivity and news value. Other ordinary applications are processed according to the application order mentioned above.</p>
<p>(3) Currently, the foreign exchange quota allocated to the department is only US$1.3 million per month, with US$650,000 for Annex (1) and US$650,000 for Annex (3) Category A.</p>
<p>(4) Applications submitted after October 1 are also reviewed according to the standards stipulated by the department without interruption, and issuance is still in progress according to the order.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Firmly Navigating</h3>
<p>From morning to closing yesterday in the tung oil market, although some industry peers still sold off at the high prices, there were still many who hoarded goods and bid up the prices. At the same time, the well-stocked white oil, mainly for export, was continuously absorbed by exporters in a hurry to meet shipping schedules. The process ultimately navigated firmly, rising to 8,500 yuan per dan, a slight increase of 30 yuan compared to before. As for Hongjiang tung oil, the footing was extremely stable, with no signs of imminent danger.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Sales by Local Merchants, Narrow Fluctuations in the Yarn Market, Slight Fall in Cotton Cloth Prices with Small Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>The yarn market presented a hovering situation, with very narrow fluctuations. Actual sales by local merchants were stagnant, and the trend was quite mediocre. As a result, most yarns showed a state of decline.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix was bid up from 16,000 yuan to 16,600 yuan in the Hankou market, ultimately holding steady at 100 yuan. Other yarns such as Jincheng Tiannv showed mixed trends. 40-count Blue Phoenix closed at 14,400 yuan, squeezing up 200 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at a low of 13,500 yuan and then stepped up briskly to close at 14,200 yuan, down 300 yuan from the previous day. Blue Phoenix also fell by 200 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods initially traded at 13,300 yuan and ultimately reached 14,000 yuan, squeezing up 300 yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell by 200 yuan. Other yarns such as Golden Rooster and Tiannv all showed softening, and the trend for coarse yarns such as 16-count and 10-count was also sluggish.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened in a weak state in the morning, and morale was low. There was a chorus of selling from all sides. However, near noon, as Guangdong and Hankou merchants made purchases on dips, market prices began to rebound. As a result, most prices were unchanged from the previous day.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 470 yuan. As the supply was very strong, asking prices became increasingly loose. However, after falling to a low of 445 yuan, it stepped up and held firm, once approaching the 500 yuan mark. It closed at 490 yuan, leveling with the previous day. Wufu fine cloth was slightly better by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Sijunzi Yuan Piji stepped up from 450 yuan to close at 490 yuan, squeezing down 5 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu Yuan Piji fell 10 yuan to close at 460 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong was at 505 yuan, ultimately falling 1 yuan. Tiaoli Yuan Guangxie opened at 290 yuan. There was little remaining in the market, and most prices were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Continued Weakness in Raw Silk and Silk Fabrics, Rayon Enters a Consolidating Phase</h3>
<p>The rayon market was quiet yesterday, and transactions were not active. Merchants in this street had very little appetite, and sellers' desire to sell was also lax. The market was mediocre, with extremely small fluctuations. The market closed slightly up by 300 yuan.</p>
<p>No. 12 Tianqiao opened at 13,000 yuan in the morning. In the middle, the market atmosphere hovered, and the trend was stable. The small gains were not significant, and there was a lack of strength to rise. As a result, there was a slight increase of 300 yuan. Other grades were flat.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk have seen a slight rebound, and sellers' desire to sell has slightly loosened. For export goods, foreign firms purchasing CD grade still had a smooth intake, and transactions continued. Domestic sales were high first and then soft, and the market presented a hovering trend. D grade 7/8 evenness opened at 15,000 yuan in the morning. In the middle of the day, due to smooth sales, morale improved, and asking prices rose by 500 yuan. Near noon, due to a drop in foreign exchange rates, morale slightly softened, and the trend turned weak. Asking prices fell back again, and the market closed at 15,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan from the previous day's noon closing. Other grades were soft. In the afternoon, as the rumors dissipated, morale slightly stabilized, and the market slightly improved by 1,100 to 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market continued to be weak yesterday, with quiet customer sales. Merchants in this street had saturated intake, and factories were still selling smoothly due to money matters. Market prices fell. Meiya Huaqiang opened at 9,500 yuan and 9,300 yuan in the morning. The process in the middle became weak, and merchants' intake intentions were unmoved. Market prices fell sharply across the board. There was still no improvement at the close. Meiya closed at 9,100 yuan, and Huaqiang closed at 9,000 yuan, squeezing down 800 yuan. Dacheng Bizhou, Dawei Ni, and others also saw squeezed down prices.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Exports May Face a Crisis</p>
<p>Currently, various foreign firms in this city are buying heavily for resale abroad because the overseas silk market has turned brisk. However, prices have not seen a significant rise because they are affected by the price limits in the US market. According to silk industry sources, the price limits announced by the United States in 1948 will expire at the end of this month. There is hope that these limits may be adjusted in the US market, so the future trend of raw silk abroad may be optimistic.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Soften</p>
<p>The spot cotton market was still small yesterday. Domestic companies were still selling actively, and yarn factories still had intentions to purchase. The market was mediocre, but most of the transactions were for swapping cotton yarn. Zhengzhou was trading at 1,600 yuan, Hankou fine velvet at 1,420 yuan, Shashi at 1,560 yuan, Huoji at 1,150 yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 260 yuan to 265 yuan.</p>
<h3>No One is Buying Export Goods, Export Trade Volume Plummets</h3>
<p>According to sources in the import and export industry, this is the time when new goods of export commodities such as bristles, tung oil, and casings are on the market, and it is also the peak season for exporters to purchase these export commodities. In previous years, exporters sent personnel to various producing areas to expand purchases. However, this year's purchasing situation is the opposite. There are hardly any exporters purchasing these export commodities. There are three reasons for this:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the war, some producing areas have been reduced to war zones, and it is no longer possible to send personnel to purchase.</p>
<p>(2) Relatively safe producing areas are only Chongqing, Wanxian, and other areas, but after the purchase, there is no transportation to Shanghai. Many ships have been requisitioned for military transport, and military transport is busier than passenger transport, leaving no time to take care of cargo transport.</p>
<p>(3) After being transported to Shanghai, if it is difficult to sell temporarily, there are concerns about their safety. Due to the lack of purchases of export goods, the current export trade has plummeted. In previous years, many foreign firms came to Shanghai to place orders at this time. Currently, foreign firms have stopped coming to Shanghai to place orders because they cannot obtain goods. The prospects for export trade have suffered another blow.</p>
