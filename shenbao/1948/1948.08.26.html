<h3>程潛誥全湘土劣　親撰文告嚴詞提出警告　怙惡不悛不惜嚴刑峻法</h3>

<h3>經合總署援華金　可間接支持金圓　美方不作穩定幣制貸款</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八月廿四日電〕據消息靈通方面人士稱：經濟合作總署之援華金，可間接用以支持中國之金圓劵。惟美國當局與國際貸款機構均表示不知中國政府對獲取新幣之支持有何措施。南京方面亦同樣予以否認，惟此種謠傳，仍繼續來到美國。</p>
<p>國際貨幣基金組織現尙未正式批准金圓劵對美元四比一之新兌換率，故中國不能獲得基金援助。至於世界銀行，除爲特別發展計劃之貸款外，不作穩定幣制之貸款。且在任何情形下，世界銀行與國際貨幣基金組織之步驟一致，對基金組織尙未批准其貨幣兌換率之政府，不會予以貸款。</p>
<p>同時，美國進出口銀行亦不作穩定幣制之貸款，財務部某發言人稱：現在財務部不可能作此種貸款。</p>
<p>據專家談稱：在經濟合作總署同意之條件下，動用一部份由出售經合總署物資得來之中國貨幣以平穩新幣，則甚有可能。彼等稱：此舉須將某些累積的紙幣「肅淸」，以穩定貨幣。</p>
<p>亦即謂，政府須將一部份累積的地方貨幣，停止其流通，中國通貨膨脹之基本原因，在於財政虧短，如此將可减少。</p>
<p>經濟合作總署稱：現在一切貸款皆於復興計劃方面，並無任何動用本署基金支持新幣之計劃。</p>
<h3>政院經濟管制會　今舉行首次會議　車船票價運費決不提高</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕因改革幣制而產生之政院經濟管制委會，頃巳決定於廿六日舉行首次會議，由行政院長翁文灝主持。該會爲推行安定經濟各項措施，其工作即將積極展開。又工商部爲配合財經緊念處分令之執行，所擬具之管制物價，取締囤積居奇辦法，原定廿五日提政務會議討論，旋以工商部彙送原案過遲，政院未及繕印，更不及審查，故廿五日未獲提出。茲悉：廿六日首次舉行之經管會中，即將提出討論，俟初步決定後，再交政務會議討論。又該會之任務即在對物價管制之策劃，督導，取締投機囤積，非法經營之策劃管制等</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕政院決定聘任徐柏園爲該院經濟管制委會秘書長，前報戰以劉攻芸出任說不確。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕昨傳交通事業漲價將由廿五日行政院政務會議討論事，據行政院負責人士宣稱：今日政務會議決不討論此事。又稱：無論火車，輪船，凡爲一般平民所使用之座位票價絕對以本月十九日票價爲準，運費關係物價至切，亦不能提高價格。</p>
<h3>短期國庫劵　決停止發行</h3>
<p>金圓公債發行有待</p>

<h3>張厲生飛抵北平　召集各機關負責人談話　聽娶執行財經措施情形</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕天津區經濟管制督導員張厲生，廿五日晨十時半，偕夏晋熊·工撫洲自滬飛抵平。華北剿總副總司令劉多荃·宋肯堂·冀主席楚溪春，平市長劉瑤章等，皆到機塲歡迎。張氏入城稍息，即赴西郊華北剿總，應傅作義歡宴，各首長作陪。下午四時，在市府召集省市府·參議會·國行·金管局等機關負責人談話，聽取兩日來執行財政經濟緊急措施情形，並予指示。張氏定廿六日下午四時召集平市工商行莊首腦談話，留平三日後赴津。至赴東北與否，現尙未定。</p>
<h3>能否渡過難關　端視財經改革</h3>
<p>張氏盼北方同胞協助</p>
<p>張厲生於下機後曾接見記者稱：請大家注意總統此次改革財政經濟的決心，我們一定要嚴格執行，全盤辦法不敢說沒有一點毛病，但決不使其影響整體，政府能否渡過難關，就看這次改革如何了，故殷望北方同胞協助。關於東北的特殊環境，政府有通盤考慮，在不影響整體利益下，決不使任何地方偏枯，東北所需最殷之物資。將設法改善。現在成問題的，仍是運輸，夏晋熊局來，將同時解決關內外的匯兌問題。關於管制物價，政府也要愼重處理，決不許商人無州故抬價，如確須加價，必先經過政府核准。關於國人存外資產，政府自有辦法，惟不能事先吿人。另據夏晋熊稱：政府於改善關內外匯兌問題時，並將自預算着手。</p>

<h3>張羣訪日之行</h3>
<p>前任行政院長張羣以私人資格，於廿一日離滬飛日考察，同行除其夫人外，另有外部顧問邵毓麟·張氏飛抵東京後發表談話，聲明此行純以私人資格作觀察旅行，幷感謝一九四五年由美返國過日時麥帥優厚的款待。張氏復稱：戰後日本和平民主建設的進程是日本國家復興的保障，也是日本與中國以及並世國家永久合作關係的基礎。每一個關心日本和關心世界大局的人士都同具此威，故聲明此次之行，係本着這種感想與期待而來。據聞這幾天，張氏除接見蘆田首相並訪晤麥帥外，民主自由黨的吉田茂，社民黨的片山哲，甚至前首相幣原喜重郎都紛紛想訪晤張氏。此可見盟總當局和日本朝野，對張氏此行不但甚表歡迎，並且視如上賓，韓國總統李承晚博土更電邀張氏赴韓一遊，從禮貌上說，是不能拒絕韓國總統邀請的，是則張氏此番的觀察旅行，遊踪至少將履及日韓兩國了。</p>
<p>此次張氏赴日考察，外間傳說紛紛，莫衷一是。儘管這些傳說出於臆斷，或係揣測，但受各方面的重視，是很顯然的。重視的原因約有幾點：（一）張氏爲中國前閣首揆，在國內政治上具有重要地位；渠爲對日專家，世人目爲中國之「日本通」，戰前又曾主持對日外交，故此次訪日自易引人注視。（二）對日和約未締結，中日國交又未恢復，在麥帥管制下的日本，原是限制私人旅行的，而此次張氏竟能以私人資格赴日考察，幷將受麥帥優厚的款待，不可謂非空前的破例。（三）國內反扶日浪潮澎湃，美日間的動態惹人注意，張氏適於此際訪日，面又爲麥帥的上賓，足徵此行意義的重大。我們對於張氏之行，自不願遽爾作過早的臆斷；惟張氏旣聲明對「戰後日本和平民主建設」有所「期待而來』，當然他此次的私人旅行，除了觀察性質以外，或多或少是要有所收穫的·應當期待什麼？應當收穫什麼？我們願站在中國國民立塲，表示一些意見。</p>
<p>一，日本投降雖已三年，但日本政治經濟社會現狀，實無和平民主的進步跡象。波茨坦宣言規定的條款，遠東委員會决議的對日基本方針，以及遠東委員會通過的賠償案，三年來鮮有實施，或實施後又有距離。我國的對日政策，原是寬大，而不報復，日本人是威思的。波茨坦宣言的精神基於不報復，遠東委員會决議事項更趨向於寛大，所以我們期待日本和平民主建設的進程，是不應該脫離這些文獻的軌範。我們唯有期待這些文獻昭示的條款，受到各方的重視，有了實施的保障，纔能獲取日本眞正的和平民主。</p>
<p>二，新憲法下的吉田·片山·蘆田三次內閣，執政以來，建樹不多，並未給日本人民創造民主進步的前途，誠爲憾事·在野若干黨派，人物複雜，水準不高，開明的自由的人士，不願與保守的官僚政治競取仕途，或寄生於學府，或隱逸於田野。這些都是日本和平民主進程最大的損失·我國如要講求扶日，扶植進步的日本，應該獲取眞正開明的自由的進步人物，促其團結成爲力量，使渠等能在政治上發生若干新陳代謝的作用，而爲未來中日良好關係有所努力。日本政治現狀有待改變，未來日本政治的進步應作遠大的期待。若日本將來依然甩戰前一套人物來看中國，來和中國交往，中國也憑着戰前一套方法和理解去應付日本，未必爲東亞前途之福。</p>
<p>三，淸算日本問題，澄淸遠東對日問題的紛歧，唯一途徑當是召開日本和會，締結對日和約，依和約進行管制，依和約復興日本，從而消釋列國間的不愉快，關於日本和會召開僵局的打開，現在並非無路可尋。在列國間的態度，英澳菲等國家是贊成召開和會的，蘇聯對日本和會的態度亦未必堅拒，目前的關鍵似在美國，而美國的關鍵又在麥帥。祗要在這方面覓致僵局打開的途徑，和會於今年內是可能成功的。在日本內部的態度，代表保守勢力的民主自由黨（吉田領　）民主黨（蘆田領導）等是不歡迎和會的，這些黨派想利用無約狀態造成若干使日本卽可復興的旣成事實·這些作風，是爲黨派打算，而非爲日本和平民主前途着想。片山領導下的社會黨及若干自由份子，則期待早日召開和會，這是具有遠識的見地，値得我捫注意。</p>
<p>上述三點，是我們研究日本問題的期待，也是我們對張氏一行訪日的期待·張氏此行，縱屬私人訪問，但如果能够在這方面有所收穫，則張氏的觀察旅行，將帶來重大的歷史意義，方可謂不虛此行。</p>
<h3>暹違約濫捕華僑　外部提嚴重抗議　促即釋放並不再發生同樣行動</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕外交部近以暹羅政府藉詞濫捕旅暹華僑，違背中暹友好條約義務，特於十七日以備忘錄一件，送交暹駐華代辦仙雅，提出强硬抗議，請其立即轉達暹政府，釋放被捕華僑，並嚴令暹警察當局制止同樣行動之再度發生。本年六月十五日，暹羅曼谷警察廳逮捕華僑五十餘人，外交部據報即電令駐暹大使館及曼谷總領事館查明被捕原因，以便交涉，乃暹方雖經我駐暹使領館交涉，詢問至再至三，仍置不答復，稽延已逾兩月，暹官廳旣未將該僑等被捕原因通知中國駐領，且始終未將被控之罪名予以公布。按中暹友好條約第五條之規定，旅暹華僑所享身體財產安全之保護與暹羅人民所享者全同，乃暹警察當局最近、以秘密結社及非法募捐爲藉口，忽又根據十年以前所頒之舊條例在各地大規模逮捕華僑，暹方報紙復透露消息，謂所捕華僑槪將驅逐出境，致造成恐怖局面，使旅暹華僑人人自危，惶惶不可終日，暹方未依法律程序，大量遠捕華僑，實與上述規定之文字與精神相抵觸，若又予以出境處分，則必使華僑之財產遭受重大損失，値茲旅暹華僑教育問題正由我駐暹大使館與暹商談之際，中國政府尤切盼暹方停止一切違約行動，以免妨害兩國之傳統友好邦交。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿五日電〕柏林蘇區陸軍司令柯蒂哥夫致函市長許勞德稱，蘇軍政府難爲市政府當局之決定及政令，在未得蘇軍政府許可前，皆屬無效。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿五日電〕柏林蘇軍司令柯蒂哥夫今日命令柏林蘇區之郵局重行審核及頒佈各期刊日報之許可證條例，九月一日起即行截止重登記。柯氏之命令無異於正式禁止西方佔區之報紙在蘇區流傳。按數月來該項報紙在蘇區內祇能秘密傳觀。</p>
<p>自美方非正式建議柏林分裂成兩部之警察互相合作後，料蘇方將於邪惡五日答覆。柏林一週來暴亂·示威·綁架無虛日，今晨突趨甯謐，各報轉而注意莫斯科最近之談判。</p>

<h3>外蒙等入會申請　將由聯大討論</h3>
<p>安理會提出審查報吿</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖邪惡四日電〕安理會今日　向聯合國大會提出特別報吿，綜述安理會審查各國申請參加聯合國事宜之現狀。目前申請參加聯合國者有阿爾巴尼亞·奧地利·保加利亞·芬蘭·匈牙利·愛爾蘭·義大利·外蒙古·葡萄牙·羅馬尼亞·外約但與錫蘭等十三國。各國之申請均經去年聯大會之初步考慮，目前正在安理會審查中。衆信安理會如不通過保匈羅阿芬與外蒙古等國之參加，蘇聯亦必不支持義奧葡與外約但愛爾蘭等國之申請，故安理會乃決定將此種局勢報吿聯大會而不作任何推舉。在阿根廷之建議下，本年度之聯合國大會將討論新會員國之入會問題，阿根廷認爲任何在安理會中得七票支持之國家，即可參加聯合國，換言之，阿根廷主張新會員國之參加，應不受否決權之限制。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社蒂拉那廿四日電〕阿爾巴尼亞政府巳照會聯合國秘書長賴依，如有希臘政府軍侵入阿境者，阿衛軍決予以扣留。在照會阿政府抗議聯合國巴爾幹委員會於八月十二日對阿保南等國之指控，力言是項指控實違反和平之利益，而表示巴爾幹委會巳成爲戰爭販子手中之工具。最後阿政府在照會中，强調如希臘　放棄其　蠶之態度、則阿話巴尼亞頗頭與之恢復談判，離立正常之外交關係。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社蒂拉那廿四日電〕阿外部今日宣佈，在過去三日內有受傷之希臘民主兵士二百四十七人，向阿邊防軍投誠。是等　兵士被解除武裝後，即送入各　院醫治。</p>
<h3>華萊士聲明　非共產黨員</h3>
<p>進步黨亦不受共黨控制</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社俄亥俄州電〕華萊士今日向報界發表書面談話稱，「余並非共奮蠶員，向未參忽共黨·」進步黨決不受共產黨之控制，進步黨之政綱亦決不受共產黨之左右。」渠謂共產主義異進步之資本主義逈乎不同，　　在若干社會設施上兩黨或有相同之處。據華萊土之意見，在美國觀有兩種共產黨，一種企圖以武力推翻美國政府，另一種則否，第三黨僅欲與後一種有共同行動。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約邪惡四日電〕　　士之談話，顯係有所爲而發者，蓋近來各方皆指責進步黨已成爲共黨之「外國」組織，此種指責將令進步黨失却甚多自由人士之支持。</p>
<h3>紐約舊金山兩蘇領館　蘇聯突下令封閉　要求美停閉少參崴領館</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕蘇聯廿四日下令將紐約及舊金山之蘇聯領事館「立即」停閉，要求美國亦停閉其在海參崴之領事館，並停止設法在列寗格勒開設美領事館之事。蘇聯向白宮提出一項照會，略調蘇聯之出此，乃因蘇聯認爲聯邦調查局會同白俄侵害在美蘇聯公民之自由·克林姆再度否認其自己之領事館官員妨害紐約兩蘇聯教師自由之行動。</p>
<p>該照會稱，蘇聯在紐約及舊金山之領事館，將立即停閉，並根據互惠政策，要求美國亦停閉其在海參崴之領事館。照會復謂，蘇聯政府認爲，在進行中之規定美國得在列寗格勒開設領事館之協議，因美國之行動而自動取消。白宮頃證實已接獲此項照會。此事發生於西方國家諸首要之官員，對莫斯科會議素抱悲觀而目前較抱有保留之樂觀之時。按國務院由於紐約蘇聯總領事洛茂金濫用職權及違犯官方正當行動之標準，曾以强硬照會，命令洛氏離境。國務院所斥各點，係根據洛氏之拘留高遜基娜夫人並至高夫人自蘇領事館四樓跳窗爲止。</p>
<h3>蘇政府支持　洛茂金行動</h3>
<p>蘇聯官方通訊社塔斯社廿四日載稱，蘇聯政府完全贊同洛茂金在處理此事方面所採取之一切行動。據稱，蘇聯覆文有謂，蘇方有「許多文件」，足以證明高夫人及另一逃走教師桑馬林曾遭綁架，並證明白俄之托爾斯泰基金令與聯邦調查局曾參預其事。塔斯社繼稱，最近之蘇聯照會，係由蘇聯大使潘友新提交國務院者。塔斯社在莫斯科電台廣播稱：「蘇聯政府認爲八月十九日美國照會中（即駁斥潘友新之抗議及命令洛氏出境事）所稱各節，並無根據，且與事實不符。」莫斯科電台並廣播美國拒絕潘友新及莫洛托夫等抗議之照會全文。蘇聯謂美國故意避免事實，對綁架案內瞹昧各點之澄淸，未能有所協助。莫斯科並謂，美國之照會「僅阻止此案及若干人士與團體，在此案內所參加部份之明朗化。」</p>
<h3>美駐韓總司令　霍奇明日返國　并發表告別韓國人已書</h3>

<h3>高夫人記者會　臨時又取消</h3>
<p>伊本擬宣布跳樓經過</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿四日電〕高遜基娜夫人邪惡四日本已同意宣布渠本人自蘇聯領事館跳樓之經過，但最後又臨時取消。某警官在阻止記者進入羅斯福醫院內高夫人病房時談稱：「渠受刺激而覺疲乏，不願接見任何人』。新聞影片及報紙方面攝影員巳到過高夫人房內，醫院當局談稱，彼等之鎂光燈泡巳使高夫人膽寒。當記者等走近病房時，高夫人即呼喚醫生前來，吿以渠感覺不能接見訪員，於是渠之內科醫生福特及外科醫生潘諾耶，即取消記者之訪問。院方本擬允許少數記者入內，但企圖擁入者竟達十餘人之多。各記者自晨間即等候至今，擬聽取高夫人本人講述其自蘇聯領事館跳窗之經過，彼等事前幷曾提出書面問題十三項。院方看護談稱，當此等問題讀與高夫人聽聆之時，渠頻頻點頭，表示贊成·各記者曾集資購花贈送高夫人。</p>

<h3>社局再曉諭各業　堅守八一九定價　造漆業指出外匯影響原料價格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局昨續召集本市各業負責人前往談話，曉以應遵照政府命令，不得超過八一九價格，結果甚爲良好。</p>
<p>造漆業同業公會負責人表示：該業自動調整依八月十四日之價格，惟有兩點困難必須解決，（一）原料困難，中國植物油廠之出品如漲價，勢必牽動該業，應請防止。（二）原來結匯證明書牌價僅八五〇萬元，刻增至一二〇〇萬元，則由國外購進原料價格業已增加，應請設法。</p>
<p>捲烟業亦表示不漲價，惟希望捐稅勿加，如政府增加捐稅，則按「羊毛出在羊身上」原則，捲烟價格勢必增加。</p>
<p>瓷業表示　並未加價</p>
<p>瓷器業公會表示外傳該業增加一二成不確，因該業有批發價與門市價之分，門市價原較批發價爲高，刻改碼者係由批發價改爲門市價，實際並未增加。社局囑該局負責人將八一九之批發及門市價格抄單送該局審核。</p>
<p>鮮肉價高　歸咎產地</p>
<p>鮮肉業表示已將零售價格每斤抑至二百萬元左右，惟本月十九日價格係根據本月十日由蘇北產地採辦之猪價，現在價格應根據十九日蘇北產地之猪價，因蘇北綏靖區捐稅甚重，關卡重重，故十九日產地價格業巳高漲，如社局根據本市八月十九日之猪肉價格限價，恐不能維持長久。社局對此將呈市府轉呈行政院請電蘇北綏靖區注意。</p>

<h3>惠明幹匪諜罪訊　移送特刑庭審訊</h3>
<p>教唆殺人部份宣吿無罪</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕江北人惠明幹，於民國三十四年在阜寗原籍王集鄉，爲共匪治安主任，時有惠明嶺者，明幹謂其有政治活動（指參加國民黨），乃唆使乃弟惠明桃殺之。是年秋國軍進剿王集鄕時，明幹與在逃之惠盛茂商議，因　　壓被害家屬，先後殺死國民黨員周希汝及當地鄉紳戴立峯等多人，以爲威脅，本年二月間，明幹與張步逮者同行來滬，爲惠明嶺之子明佐得悉，當報吿警備司令部將明幹拘獲，渠堅不承認參加共匪工作，後經該部電請阜寗方面查復，確有其事，以明幹爲唆使殺人犯，移送地檢處偵查，提起公訴。張步達部份因內亂罪，巳送特種刑庭偵查。昨午地院開庭，以被吿惠明幹教唆殺人，無確切證據，當庭宣吿無罪，惟有匪諜罪嫌，移送特種刑庭審訊。</p>
<h3>澈底整飭軍風紀　警備部舉行會議</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾爲澈底整飭軍風紀，於昨日上午十時邀集在滬各軍事機關首長，各部隊長官舉行會議。席間宣氏申述警備部奉令整飭軍風紀，具有極大決心，惟此一工作甚爲艱鉅，除由憲兵團及警備部之軍風紀糾察隊經常負責外，並希望陸海空軍聯勤各軍事單位協同努力，分別約東部下，維護良好之軍譽，會議決定：（一）海空軍與後勤各單位，派員組織巡查隊，配合憲兵與警備部之糾察隊，進行整飭軍風紀工作。（二）軍人乘坐公共交通車輛，及進入娛樂塲所，務須遵照規定辦理。（三）每週六與週末招待觀劇，受招待之各部隊，應派官長一人負責帶隊維持秩序。</p>

<p>頭號日戰犯岡村寗次大將，經本市國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭，於二十三日首次公審後，發覺搜集之證據，尙感不足，爲鄭重起見，決定改期再審。唯公審日期，迄未決定，悉經探悉，其原因有二：（一）須向各有關方面徵集有力之證據，（二）公審經費不足，二十三日公審岡村寗次一次，即中膳一項，即耗國幣達十餘億，先後準備佈置等全部費用，則達三十億之鉅，而國防部所撥發之公費，則尙不足所耗之半數，故該庭業已再度向國防部呈請撥發經費，俾利迅速審結。至外傳岡村寗次可能於最近期內，解送東京國際法庭之說，據軍法庭表示，絕對不確，因岡村並無參加侵華之中央系統組織，其所犯罪行，僅限於中國戰塲所造成之事實，故無解送東京國際法庭之必要。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕滬西法華寺，佔地三十餘畝，，建有大殿五間，淪陷期間爲偽保安司令部占爲修械所之用，並於大殿之外，另雞二層樓房三幢，廚房二問。勝利時由國防部保密局接收，撥充倉庫，並派馬厚卿爲管理員，前年冬該倉庫物資出淸後，馬即通知寺僧增昌，謂奉令將房產交還業主，而增昌亦即認該項房產爲寺產，旋馬串通馬會輔者，自增昌手中將上開房產租下，改作回教堂所辦之興基小學，屋內電話一只，於本年一月六日，由馬義方者侵占過戶。事經國防部保密局查明，除將馬厚卿扣押，依軍人身份，判處徒刑七年外，全案移地檢處偵查，該處認爲寺僧增昌，興基小學之馬會輔及馬義方侵占敵產，一併提起公訴。昨由地院開庭，被吿僅到增昌一人，供該寺房屋於二十六年已造成一部，但未完工，即爲僞保安司令部繼續造竣，後來馬厚卿以口頭通知發回，同時再由渠介紹開辦小學等語，庭上以其餘被吿未到，諭改期再訊，增昌交原保。</p>

<h3>鑑定黃金成色　專家參與主持　國行聲明抑價收買說係誤會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳國行收兌黃金時，有故意壓低黃金成色，如往兌者不願折價兌出時，有强制收買等情。記者特以此詢諸主持收兌工作之業務局李副局長曉莊，據云：外傳種種，悉屬誤會。以黃金成色而諭，財經緊急方案所定之純金標準爲千分之千，但近年來本市之黃金，大都不能達此標準，故在收兌之際，照章按其成色，酌打折扣，但絕無故意壓低成色之事。至於强制收買，更屬誤傳，因黃金收兌之際，排隊依次兌換，辨事人員爲經濟時間起見，希望往兌者勿臨時改變主張，虛耗光，但如堅持不兌，亦決無勉强之意。同時每兩黃金收兌後，往兌者均領有單據，載明重量成色，如有疑問，可憑此領出原金複驗。關於決定黃金成色是否有客觀標準一點，則央行及其他委託銀行辦理收兌時，均有專家參與，其決定之精確性雖不能與熔解分析相比，但與實際不致相去甚遠。</p>
<h3>收兌成績愈來愈好　昨日總數逾千萬圓</h3>

<h3>前日收兌總額　九百餘萬金圓</h3>
<p>二十四日爲國行及其委託各行開始收兌金銀外幣之第二日，市民遵守法令，持金銀外幣申請兌換金圓劵者，較廿三日更爲踴躍，雖値陰雨，而請兌行列仍延達戶外。總計二十四日本市國行及其委託代理各行合共收進黃金一萬七千一百廿八兩六錢九分六，兌出金圓劵三百四十二萬五千七百卅九圓二角。白銀收進二萬四千九百五十四兩七錢九分三，合共兌出金圓劵七萬四千八百六十四圓三角七分九。銀幣收進四萬七千二百四十三塊，合共兌出金圓劵九萬四千四百八十六圓。美鈔收進一百廿八萬八千三百十七元六角五分，合共兌出金圓券五百十五萬三千二百七十圓六角。港鈔收進五十七萬五千一百卅元一角，合共兌出金圓券四十三萬一千三百四十七圓五角七分五。收進以上五種金銀外幣，共兌出金圓券九百十七萬九千七百零七圓七角五分。</p>

<p>都江電廠在川西灌縣，利用著名世界的都江堰水利，興修水電工程。記者到灌縣，特地對該廠作全面採訪。首先是工程整個計劃與勘測經過，第一個主持工程計劃與勘測的是美國水力工程權威薩凡奇博士。薩氏在卅三年七月應聘來川，先後到大渡河，馬邊河及岷江上游一帶作實地查勘，擇定灌縣魚嘴與麻溪作壩址。其次卅四年春，戰時生產局特請美國輸電專家指導川西勘測處，深入川西內部的岷江上游經年餘勘測，完成壩址鑽探和水文研究等工作。到了卅五年都江電廠建設計劃確立，資委會謀向加拿大貸款興工，遂由加工程師薩克斯一行與資委會水電總處合組工程團，到灌勘測壩址，研究都江水力與開發程序。卅六年三月工作次第完成。這其間，薩凡奇博士，美地質專家鍾佛歐，資委會美籍工程師甘文基均先後到灌作壩址浚勘，地質調查及最後設計等工作，至卅六年四月，全部工程計劃作最後決定。</p>
<p>兩種計劃：美加兩國專家　意見各有不同</p>
<p>偉大的都江電力，工程計劃有兩種：一是美國薩凡奇博士主持的，計劃在都江上游魚嘴建立二十萬啓羅瓦特的發電廠一座，在麻溪建立五十萬啓羅瓦特的發電廠一座，另在魚嘴修建堤壩（長一千零八十公尺，高七十公尺，落差卅五公尺），估計全部經費美金五千萬元，發電成本美金二厘五。完成以後的效用，以百分之六十作灌溉，百分之四十作發電，可以電化整個川西平原。其次是加拿大工團主持的，意見完全相反，他們認爲川西根本不能消化如此鉅大的電力，同時經費與材料來源均成問題，所以原則應該縮小範圍。他們的計劃是：先在灌縣紫平舖建立五萬瓩發電廠一座麻柳灣五萬瓩發電廠一座，猴子坡三萬五千瓩發電廠一座。另在漩口建立一座二十五萬瓩的發電廠，同時修建堤壩（長八百六十七公尺，高七十八公尺，落差四十公尺。）這兩次大計劃，經過川省府與資委會縝密硏究，決定同意並採用加工程師計劃，同時以前幾處，經地質分析均不美滿，決定全力興修漩口發電廠，這即是今日的都江電廠。</p>
<p>初期工程：兩年艱苦興修　都江火廠完成</p>
<p>計劃決定之後，準備實施工程，由資委會與川省府合組都江電廠主持其事。並決定分工程爲兩部份：第一部份先興修都江火電廠，卅五年工程開始，首由資委會分配二千瓩電機兩部，經過無數波折，卅五年底始領到一部啓運入川，但爲了交通運輸諸種問題，整整十個月電機才拆卸分裝運到灌縣蒲村的火電廠。再經過工程人負四個月夜以繼日的趕裝，並架設蓉灌長途輸電綫路，計本年二月發電廠全部工竣，六月輸電全部完成，六月搶修成都配電所，上月正式發電，火電廠第一期工程遂吿完成。</p>
<p>記者參觀都江火電廠，廠址在灌縣蒲村，佔地頗廣，電廠現有機械，包括給水設備與輸煤機，兩部鍋爐與兩部蒸汽機，汽輪發電機，冷凝器及冷部塔，另外附設修械廠。現在發電總量爲二千瓩，供應本廠一百瓩，空軍幼校及煤礦谷一百瓩，灌縣兩百瓩，其餘一千五百瓩全部輸送成都。最近資委會又配撥五千瓩電機一部，巳遝到重慶，如交通運輸無問題，年內可裝置完竣。</p>
<p>電化川西·今後工程重心　完成水電計劃</p>
<p>至於當前工作的重心，全力在進行水電廠的鑽探工作，迄今年餘，已在漩口方面鑽探一百三十餘洞，火電廠成功，對於鑽探及各項興修工程，帮助不少。今後全力着重水電廠的分期工程是：第一期完成鑽探，第二期修建廠址，第三期安裝機器與完成壩堤工程，最後是構成川西輸電網。將來計劃是以灌縣（都江電廠）爲中心，以週圍二百五十公里的幅射路綫作半徑，北到劍閣，西達懋功，南抵雅安，東至資陽都包括在這個「川西電力網」以內。這是「天府之國』最精華地區，計劃中在這電力區內的輕重工業，包括有：製豐，製糖，煤，化學肥料，造紙，水泥，鋼鐵，棉紡，羊毛等等，配合成渝鐵路完成以後，四川的建設遠景，光明無垠。</p>
<p>在都江電廠作半日的參觀與訪問，僅僅看到雖是火電廠的表面與水電廠的計劃，另外是工程人員的緊張工作精神，但從這裏看出了都江電廠的成功與四川建設前途的光明。</p>

<h3>關吉玉談糧食</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿三日訊〕在新穀登塲金圓劵出世的初秋，爲了想多知道一點有關江蘇征糧·購糧·借糧的消息，此次訪問糧食部長關吉玉，聽取了他對於人人所關心的糧食問題的一席話，今述其概要如次：</p>
<p>晤談之初，記者劈頭第一句就問他今年全國秋收的糧食，根據各省報吿，初步估計的結果如何，他很坦白的說：今年產糧最多的地區，如四川·湖南·江西。巳因水災關係，使收成减少，但就全面約計，則爲　歉互見，問題尙不能說過分嚴重。如果本年購運之外糧，如數如期，源源而來，預期之調劑調配工作，將來在各地積極展開，軍糈民食，都可望獲得適當解決，因爲當前軍糧的重要，是盡人皆知，而由於戰禍未巳，所造成的民食問題的嚴重，已使舉國人士深切了解：糧部爲了執行國策，在戰時每年必須實施這應變的糧政，如征購·征借·實有其萬不得巳之苦衷，不得不切實奉行和協助，現在戡亂戰爭，巳進向至一決定階段，一俟秋高馬肥，國軍在各綫必能獲得決定性之勝利，但是要使士飽，要使後方之丁壯都能吃飽，就必須使政府「足食」「足兵」的政策順利推行。記得第一次世界大戰時，主持美國糧政的胡佛，曾經這樣說過：「戰爭之最後勝利，繫於民食。」當時德國參謀總長毛奇，亦嘗謂：「欲不戰而亡德國，除非破壞德國之農業，封鎖德國之糧食。」後來，毛奇之言，果不幸而言中。戰時糧政之重要，中外實同此一例。</p>
<p>說到國內各省的糧食消長與盈虛，關部長說：在他本人所著，今年五月出版的「中國糧政問題」一書內，說明我國去年產糧，包括米麥及雜糧爲：一三七·〇六八·〇〇〇公噸，但全國全年消費的糧食則爲一四一·〇三四·〇〇〇公噸，計虧三·九六六·〇〇〇公噸，而去年國內餘糧地區竟有東九省，四川·江蘇·台灣·以及湘·鄂·贛·皖·察·靑·寗·熱·滇·等卅一省，缺糧地區，則有粵·桂·豫·冀·黔·閩·浙·陝·綏·新·甘·康·以及平·津·京·滬·渝·瀋·漢·靑·西安·廣州等二十四省市，以有餘補不足，調盈濟虛的結果，所缺之糧，厥惟仰給於外糧。今年五月中估訂：本年我國可能進口之外糧，約爲八十萬公噸，倘若本年全國產量不下於去年，何况今年的情形，顯然與去年巳大大不同，缺糧問題之嚴重，益可想而知，好在今後，外糧之進口，將與日俱增，但根本解決糧荒之道，積極的做法，首須切實展開增產工作，消極的方法，應該儘可能從事糧食之節約。此外，談到本年內江蘇民食調配問題，他說這是一件最重要的工作，巳經由蘇省府及省田糧處，在積極進行中，糧部當盡最大努力，予以輔助和督導，因爲蘇省各地的糧價穩定與否，往往與京滬互爲因果，尤其是在財政與經濟緊急處分令公布後的今天，更加値得注意。</p>
<p>最後，我們談了一些新穀上市後的糧價，記者提到某些地區新穀價錢，顯然巳向陳穀看齊時，他似乎感喟地說：今年情形與往年不同，但囤積之風終可望在加强管制的嚴刑峻法下，由逐漸减少而至於消滅。</p>

<h3>經濟督導會緊急會議決定紗布限制南運　食油原料暫行標上出口三個月</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午十時，劉攻芸·蔣經國，於國行總裁室，召集緊急會議，討論穩定本市若于必需品價格問題。到糧次陳良·吳國楨·吳開先·楊綽庵·張禹九·李立俠·林崇墉·陳述會等十餘人，經通過要案多項。其中關於食油部份，經議決電請政院，明令禁止菜油豆油蔴油花生油及其原料出口，暫以三個月爲期。對於食油轉；，斟酌華南各都市實際需要，加以限制，如有食油及其原料剩餘者，委託中信局或其他機構收購。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日午後四時，劉攻芸·蔣經國·再度召開會議，討論紗布問題。吳國楨·吳開先·東雲章·王啓宇·吳味經·李立俠·林崇　·劉建羣·等均出席。議決下列各案：（一）呈請政院限制紗布南運，並授權上海區經濟管制督導員，商定實施辦法。（二）紡建及央行，自今日（廿六日）起，在八月十九日限價以內，按掛牌辦法拋售。（三）美援棉花指定專人洽商，務求迅即提出分配各紗廠，此外尚通過其他要案多項。</p>
<p>又訊：關於臺糖核售價格，本月十九日每市担售價原合三十金圓另一角七分，昨日核售價每市祖爲二十七元一角金圓，復經劉攻芸向台糖公司治定，以後核售價格，決在「八一九」限價以下。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆濫人心堅挺　紗市升達漲限　棉布平穩臨收轉俏</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因業中銀根鬆濫趨勢頗堅，惟塲內人心閒散，公會當局爲遵奉經濟管制辦法，至十一時許，函吿同業，塲內交易均須照十九日市價折算成交，並將十九日之市價折合金圓價格公佈，但喊價大都升達限度，（本報市價一覽棉紗行情，係依照公會市塲做價刊佈），然買賣雙方各抱觀望，因此上午成交單僅四紙，共計成交十四件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市塲，晨間未開盤時，公會董理事長蒞塲，申述當局意旨，萬勿超越限價，以免遭受憊處，至合法利潤，自當要求予以保障，並請舫　公司充份配售龍顯細布及四君于元嗶嘰，以應市銷。此時大批經警人員開到，戒備森嚴，監視交易。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，開做買賣，喊價即吿下瀉一元三角，並傳紗布有禁止出口之說，隔日浮多出龍，行情步小二角，市基徘徊。嗣因漢口帮稍有進取，市上銀根鬆馳，市勢亦形轉俏，回蘇至廿九元二角站住，較上日徵好一角。五福喇叭童則軋降一至五角，四君子元嗶嘰交易較活，回好五角，（較十九日尙差二角。）其地白坯布及色布府綢等，大都呈平疲狀態，成交總額一千四百四十疋。</p>
<p>又訊：午後當局派駐經警人魚，嚴密梭巡塲外交易，商人鮮敢以身試法，故未聞做開。</p>
<p>又訊：據業中人談稱：近日市面堅俏之主因，係紡建公司對高檔貨巳有數期未加開售，市上轉碼缺乏，同時銀根奇鬆，業外游資潛入活動，致引起人心看好，買戶增加，同業扳俏，漲風遂起。前途變化如何，須視紡建公司是否儘量供售，以爲市塲做價上落之主要關鍵云。</p>
<h3>中紡國行拋售紗布</h3>
<p>中紡門市部昨售紗六五二件，合二十支一二五三又二分之一件，計金圓五三〇，三三六圓。又代央行拋出四八一件，金額爲三一三，四九〇金圓。</p>

<h3>去化呆滯交易寥落　米市趨勢再疲　麺粉微挺食油喊價平定</h3>
<p>米市初挺後疲，欲漲管力，結果反見軋跌。辰開貨主因覺上日米價獨小，故圖扳高，初市喊升五角，惟因去化呆木，交易寥寥，中途即見回平。後市更因供多銷淡，略見降落，南市塲白粳及早稻均跌五角，秈米亦挫五角，薄稻·新粳仍站原盤。北市塲較平，中次早薄稻削三五角，餘均平平，新羊秈登塲開十八元五角，昨日到貨四〇六七石。</p>
<p>麺粉微挺，因廠方連日未有開出，市上貨少尤以老車等老牌粉貨稀而漲，雜牌粉較爲穩定，兵船粉開市爲七元，後更至七元一角五分，老車七元三角五分。建成，紅蜂，各開七元一角三分，計漲一角五分至二角。雜牌粉長城及鳳凰略升，餘均平定·麩皮稍跌五分，小麥廠盤七元七角。</p>
<p>雜糧堅穩，市場為促使同業勿超過限價，昨公佈八月十九日之標準價格，交易大都以限價開出。漢口乍豆十元〇三角三分，梅靑，冬豆均按限價開出，苞米，元麥北帮銷路仍佳，加上五角，新苞米十二元五角，茶豆平定，蠶豆無上落，芝蔴平定，生仁按限價有成交，惟售戶不多。</p>
<p>食油盤旋於限價，生油上日價格距限價尚有三元之差，昨日即一躍達六十四元（吉桶）之限價，計挺三元。豆油廠方及回籠均有吐出，價格較上日收市低五角，各廠豆油大都爲五十一元五角，生菜油四十六元五角，市稱定勢。小車蔴油原價開出，豆餅略加一二角，交易不多。</p>
<h3>銀根益見鬆濫　行局庫再差出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲金圓券發行第三日，銀根益見鬆濫，暗息目四角許節節下瀉，最低達一角五分，與行莊放款息業巳軋平。平均拆款息爲二角，國家行局庫再差出五萬元，內中央出一六一萬元，大交換入八四萬元，洋商出五二萬元，小交換出二七萬元，中國入二二萬元，交通入八二萬元，中農入二萬元，中信入一三萬元，郵匯入二〇萬元，合作金庫入八萬元。交換所交換票據二〇一一三三張，交換總金額五九，八六九，一六二，二四元。</p>
<h3>全車棉產估計　產量以江蘇為最多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國紡聯會及農林部棉產改進諮委會，昨聯銜發表，本年第一次全國棉產估計報吿。此次估計，係根據冀·魯·晋·豫·秦·蘇·浙·皖·贛·鄂·湘·蜀·遼·隴·滇·台·及寗夏十七省調查估計報告而製成，以本年七月底情形為標準。</p>
<p>本年此十七省棉田，計三七五六四千市畝，產量一一三三二千市担，較上年最後估計棉田三八八六一千市畝，產量一一〇二三千市担，計棉田减少一二九七千市畝，惟產量仍增三〇九千市担，實屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>十七省中，產量以江蘇省最多，計二二八六千市担，較去年增九萬八千市担，設非蘇北治安影響，產量尙不止此。再次爲湖北之一八六六千市担，第三爲山東之一六一〇千市担。惟湖北以治安關係，今年產量巳見劇减，（按去年產量爲六二四一千市担，）他如陝西浙江等省，增產亦具成績，計陝西一一一五千市担，浙江四九五市担。</p>
<p>减產最多者，有河南·湖南·遼寧等省，或因兵災，或因水災，均吿劇减。計河南九三四千市担，湖南二二〇千市担，遼寗僅一萬市担。</p>
<h3>指定銀行公會開會討論外匯交易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市指定銀行公會，於昨日下午二時卅分舉行臨時會員大會，就改革幣制後之外匯交易，有所討論。結果決議：</p>
<p>（一）對於各銀行所報之外匯行情，如何一致問題，決議原則上仍按一·二五之手續費扣除折成買賣價，其尾數則自行斟酌。</p>
<p>（二）前曾要求中央銀行收回結匯證明書，國行表示未有此意，決議仍在市上買賣，由進出口商雙方目動軋平籌碼。</p>
<p>（三）出口商所有遠期外匯，由國行給利息一角八分，似覺太低。惟因國行已准出口商之遠期外匯頭寸，如未到期者，得以早售還予國行，故利息問題，巳不十分重要。</p>
<h3>各種主要輸出品實行限價出口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會爲增加出口起見，巳於前日（廿四日）起實行主要輸出品限價出口，計桐油定爲每磅美金二角，猪鬃（天津五十五號長　）每磅美金九元一角。冰蛋則巳與英糧食部簽訂合同，在上海交貨價格每担二〇四鎊五先令。草帽品質最普通者，每打五美元。茶葉之價格，尙在擬訂中。至於生絲價格，國內價格爲D級生絲每磅二元九角美金，而美國市價則在三元以上，國際市塲價格巳高於國內價格，故限價已不需要。</p>
<h3>出口商人希望改善</h3>
<p>輸出入管理委員會因配合經濟緊急處分令，特將出口貨予以限價出口，此點頗引起出口商之反感。據出口業負責人昨稱：本年度出口業務在幣制未改革前，始終無法興旺。實因國內出口物資價格過高，運往國外，無利可圖。幣制改革後，國內物價可較穩定，出口方面正擬加强輸出，以爭取國外市塲，奠定國外市塲基礎，詎輸管會實行限價制度，無異阻止出口業務發展。旦南洋各地之紗布市塲，目前日貨正絡續貶價傾銷，我國亦應貶價運銷，以爭取市塲地位。菲洲方面，亦正可將茶葉等物運銷，爭取以往市塲，如受限制，使出口貨無法以較低之價格出口，實對出口方面有莫大阻碍，盼輸管會能有補充辦法，予以改善也。</p>
<p>又訊：輸管會以政府公佈整理財政，及加强管制經濟辦法第九條，關於輸出入管理辦法，規定自第七季起輸入限額應該核减四分之一，並對限額以外輸入貨品，指定若干類貨品准許商民申請輸出，惟此項規定，僅屬原則性質，未有具體辦法。該會爲不使轍入工作停頓計，乃派該會副處長鄧友金，於昨晚晋京，向行政院請示，然後商訂具體實施細則云。</p>

<h3>捲菸洋酒等加稅</h3>

<h3>銀行公會理監事會　討論行莊資本問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行公會，於昨日下午二時卅分起，召開理監事聯席會議，錢業信託業均派代表參加，出席共三十餘人，由銀行公會理事長李銘主席。當對金融業資本之調整辦法，詳加討論。</p>
<p>席間意見，咸認爲政府目前所定之行莊最低資本額，實屬太高，各行莊頗感不能負担。又對於銀行學會所擬定之辦法，亦因對資本額之原則，不能解決而不　討論。直至六時許，仍無具體決議。最後乃決定靜候政府當局之實施調整資本辦法，及國家行局庫之如何調整資本發表，以供參考後，再作定奪。</p>
<p>散會後，由銀行公會秘書長孫俶仁，代表該會發表談話稱：以統計數字爲根據，就情理而論，民國廿六年上海各行莊存款總額，約爲四十億元，發行總額約十四億元，當時上海各行莊之資本總額約四億元，約爲存款總額十分之一，發行總額三分之一强。</p>
<p>今若令上海各行莊信託公司增資至一百萬金圓，錢莊增資至五十萬金圓，以銀行一百〇五家，（除國家行局省市銀行及外商銀行外，）每家資本一百萬金圓，計錢莊信託公司共九十家，每家資本五十萬圓，則全部資本，應升爲金圓一億五千萬元，折合法幣四百五十萬億元，約當目前國家發行總額四分之三。如再加國家行局之資本，幾可達發行之金額全部，再與目前存款總額相此，六月份上海商業行莊信託公司之存款，計法幣十三萬億元，折合金圓四百五十三萬圓，昔日資本爲存款額十分之一，今日資本爲存款額之卅八倍，輕車倒置，莫此爲甚。</p>
<p>渠復表示，各行莊之資本，均係呈准財部，今因改革幣制，而又不予承認，殊覺不合理。</p>

<h3>市中校長會商下期學雜費熱烈討論未獲決定　教職聯代表列席爭進修費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市立中等學校校長於昨日下午四時假山海關路育才中學集會商討收費問題，出席各校校長二十餘人，由高級護士校長朱碧暉任主席，市教局李局長亦出席。熱烈討論歷三小時半，未獲決定。將由李局長將各校畏所擬標準與教局標準，一併彙呈吳市長核定。</p>
<p>教師進修費</p>

<h3>蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>「一年容易又秋風」，詩句雖俗，到了節令，自會予人無窮感嘆。這兩天，晚上在作孟蘭盆會，法鼓金鐃，白天在講金元法幣，街談巷議。我們夙無　擔之儲的酸丁腐儒，唯有到這時候最太平最寫意，平生無負人處，懺錢固可不花，美鈔金銀，全不屬我，更無憂煎惶惑之必要。入晚凉生，月華乍上，聽牆角草叢，唧唧啾啾，「一葉且或迎意，微虫有足引心」，這便是我的天地。無怪乎自三百篇以下，漢魏歌風，詩人都喜歡以秋虫入律也。</p>
<p>最早入詩的蟋蟀，當然得數唐風蟋蟀一章。今日翻出朱傳重讀，覺得魏唐等北方人民，自來生活不甚良好。蟋蟀起首四句，「蟋蟀在堂，歲聿其莫，今我不樂，日月其除！」分明是牢騷口吻，與緊連的山有樞，隰有楡一詩，語意非常相彷。這一層拋開不講，蟋蟀入堂而歲暮，自然是古今曆法不同，　風七月：「七月在野，八月在宇，九月在戶，十月蟋蟀入我床下，」是更有名的佳句，這裏分明說淸楚蟋蟀在堂乃是十月，周正建子，十月正是歲暮，話是說得極正確的。然而不知如何，今日北方，到小陽春十月還能聽到蟋蟀的，究竟極少，豈古今風候有殊乎？旗人常用胡盧養蟈蟈兒，可以度過冬日，此則另是一種苟延性命之法，託庇高門與一橡自蔽，在品格上又自不同了。</p>
<p>中國人對於自然的看法，雖然自古頗有欣然相忘的傳統，使異國人亦讚其高致，但世俗却是功利的觀念居多。詩人看「衆鳥欣有託」或是「草長鶯飛」，俗人則必須把鳥裝在籠子裏玩其鳴聲毛羽，而且可以魯價待沽，微虫如蟋蟀，遂也不免乎此，那大率只好說是爲了「蘭膏自煎熬，多才爲患害」吧？蟋蟀雖然淸越的「鳴秋」，事實上並沒人欣賞這瞿瞿之聲，而且要殘忍的看他鬥。半閒堂大宰相玩之於先，明宣宗大皇帝繼之於後，讀聊齋志異的「促織」一文，使人忿塡胸臆，原來專制時代，在三吏三別的災難之外，尙有此耳目之娛的虐政存在！民主時代，幸而免，這是我們最高興的一件事。</p>
<p>莊子上載卞莊子看虎鬥的事，總是有些不道德。若是以漢陰丈人的說法衡量，此亦即機心之一端矣。人之所以異於禽獸者幾希」，這個恐怕也是所希者之一二，所謂「庶民去之君子存之」者，本來是抬高君子身價，其實照我上面的看法，正說明君子之不成東西耳。孟子的話與孔子不大相同，孔子會說「先進於禮樂野人也」這樣的老實話，孟子却偏偏說了這種與事實不相符的妄談，後世如韓退之等，皆是此種妄目標榜的討厭鬼。離題太遠了，如今我們仍舊回到蟋蟀。我所要說的無非感覺看兩個小虫子苦苦相爭，死了的還要罵他「廢料，不行」，勝了的就賞識他的『翹然長鳴」，眞不知是一種什麼居心！顧鐵卿法嘉錄記吳門鬥蟋蟀更加可怕：</p>
<p>「白露前後，馴養蟋蟀，以爲賭鬥之樂，謂之秋興，俗名鬥謙績。提籠相望，結隊成羣，呼其虫爲將軍，以頭大足長爲貴，靑黃紅黑白正色爲優。大小相若，銖兩悉稱，然後開栅門，時有執草引敵者，曰敵草，兩造認色，或紅或綠，曰標頭。台下觀者，即以台上之勝負爲輸贏，謂之貼標門，分籌馬，謂之花。花，假名也，以制錢一百二十文爲一花，一花至百花千花不等，憑兩家議定。勝者得彩，不勝者輸金，無詞費也。」</p>
<p>你看這局面，比跑馬廳看賽馬或逸園看跑狗如何？</p>
<p>秋晚本極寂靜，但鄰居小兒，手拿洋燈盆水，無論聽到什麼地方有了呌聲，立即跑過去灌澆，非把虫子弄出來不止。到第二天一早，多半都死於戰鬥或被蹂躪而丟棄了，於是又從新捉拿。虫而有知，其將謂何？</p>
<h3>紀大龍湫</h3>

<p>秋署猶厲，晚燈孕汗，枕上有夢，每落在永嘉山水之間。憶余普遊雁舊，取道溫嶺之沙山塘，蒲帆揚海，凡三十里，抵白溪鎭；而後循謝公　，止於龍　軒。時方雨後，讀康南海「有水自天來』句，頻能狀實。亦曾紀有長歌，恨無以窮其勝概也。</p>

<h3>袁寒雲十三事</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>袁寒雲氏，在項城諸子中，最以　才不　見稱，　事流傳，堪資酒後茶餘之談助。氏行二，名克文，字豹岑（一說：其誕生時，項城夢外人携一小金豹見貽，因本易義，爲取名字），一字抱存，號寒雲。生母隸高麗籍，血統攸傳，故膚特白皙。幼而岐嶷，有神童之目，初受業於方地山，詩文古泉，學承新傳；嗣鑑別古器，師宣古愚；考訂版本，從李盛鐸。生平服膺三子，執禮甚恭。先是，當項城秉政日，居故宮流水音，座客常盈，勝流坌集。除至友步林屋外，詩人易實甫羅癭公（易邏逸事殊多，當另文記之）輩，日必踵至，相與流連文酒，不啻神仙中人也。</p>
<p>寒雲旣弸中彪外，於書法辭章考證三者，　不徧參。顧書法一道，尤卓然名世，總彼弱冠習柳，晚歲參以登善筆法，瘦硬圓勁，兼而有之，遂一變胎骨，自立面目，方其作小楷時，輒仰臥揮毫，寫楹聯，則懸腕臨空，用能小大由之，無捉襟見肘之憾。丙寅後，落款改署寒雲，作篆體草書狀，簽字式若四十二。因妾名溫雪，爰又治印，文曰寒雲溫雪。</p>
<p>氏又工詩詞，如憶小桃紅弔林白水等詞，或感洪憲舊事，或哀復辟喪亂，弦外有音，讀之神往。丙寅況蕙風姻怕歿於海上，更撰挽聯曰：「比夢窗白石，老宿成家，儘低唱淺斟，一代詞人千古在。溯漚尹缶廬，股勤共話，愴小樓淸夜，十年江國幾回逢。」悼賢之情，不勝悽惻。</p>
<p>寒雲嘗廣　宋元善善本，更僕難數。最珍貴者，約二百種，特顏書室日一皕宋書藏」，柳河東魚玄機　集，　加網羅，用是藏書名滿天下。凡宋刻元板，一經題跋，立可善價待沽，識者遂許海內孤本，幾爲囊括，黃蕘圃以後一人而已。餘列皮藏郵票金磅小銅器古泉印章扇骨之屬，品玩鑑賞時，輒　拓朱鈐，附日記後。措乎趣嗜寡恒，取舍廢定，譬諸興會集郵，則厚資搜購，異日易嗜古泉，便又立鬻舊藏，棄若敝屣。除古書外，未嘗並時兼蓄二物，而物亦無連嗜數年之久，永存者唯半壁書城耳。</p>
<p>其於人也亦然，　易姬妾，咸江浙產，如瓊姬，鳳珠，小鶯鶯，佩文等皆是。觀所譜浣谿沙蝶戀花諸詞，風流蘊籍，正似張緒當年。素虔信神道，抵濟公壇卜終生，得詩十二首，首必隱嵌每妾之名，至後果騐（惟　至第九妾，即遽謝人世）。每値元旦，必向濟公像叩首。據自謂所以玩世不恭，蓋有難言之痛，即稱皇二子，與夫參加安淸，亦皆基不得巳苦衷。保身之道，蓋在此矣。</p>
<p>逮項城旣逝，一門三十三人（計弟兄十七人，姊妹十六人），平分遺產，各獲現款九萬，房地產十四萬。時寒　初獲產業，來滬卜居虹口，旋又數遷白克路（即今中美醫院隔壁）霞飛路等處，揮霍不二年，卒阮囊羞澀，債台高築，唯日恃典質骨董，以迄老死。晋霖</p>

<h3>好官難做</h3>
<p>— 夢周</p>
<p>好官難做，中外一律。</p>
<p>美國前任內政部長伊克斯，公正淸廉，是羅斯福總統最賞識的「能員」之一，但至他鐵面無私，毫不徇情，因之也得罪了無數同僚。</p>
<p>在第二次大戰期間，他因爲政府各部門浪費在「公文旅行」上的紙張實在太多，就從自己主管的內政部做起，不准屬僚浪費紙張。不料這些屬僚都有相當官僚氣息，平日受慣了伊克斯的氣，這時候就乘機報復。他們把伊克斯關於節約紙張的任何命令，每一種都印上幾千份，分發四十八州，再轉發給各郡各鎭，這一來就用掉了不知多少紙張。而目，他們還印發無數文吿，無數表格，要各地方機關月報每月紙張消耗數量，各州又層轉彙報，又用掉了不少紙張。最後，他們又命令各州轉各地方機關，要他們書面呈報節約紙張的計劃，還要按月報吿實施節約紙張計劃的進度——平空多用了許許多多紙張。</p>
<p>伊克斯再度努力，下令公文力求簡短，四句話就說的明白的事情，不准拖長爲四節充滿了「等因奉此」等廢話濫套的文字。目的：還是要節約紙張。但是那些官僚們却又出花樣，寫四節文字時用一張大信箋，寫四句話照樣也用這樣一大張，紙張仍未節省。伊克斯　氣之餘，再下命令，打字務求緊密，凡用半張紙就可以够寫的公文，只准用一半大小的信箋，他的下屬們也和顏悅色的照辦了——但是歸檔的時候　，卻為了「易於查檢」起見，把那此寫半張紙的文件統統貼在大張紙上之後才分門別類的放好。非但費紙，而且還多費了許多職員的時間！</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>科名之迷人，除了一切公權實利優先之外，還空些烘雲托月裊裊餘音，淘醉了彼時少年的心曲，常把科塲得意與男女結婚的蜜月風光相提並論。如「洞房花燭夜，金榜題名時十，與「書中一自有黃金屋，書中自有顏如玉」，都是迷惘一般的美詞，而「重宴瓊林」「重宴鹿鳴」可與「重諧花燭」　其濃郁之興味。</p>
<p>結婚滿六十年，不是常見的事，故謂之「金婚」。假定男女都是二十歲成禮，必須倆人都活到八十，一個八十尙且古之大稀，何况一對老人重新化裝，重拜花堂。科名之「重宴」亦復如是。八九十歲的老人，插花披紅，與新科少年舉杯互祝，亦是老年少興。所以科塲雖停廢多年，老舉人老進士，也念念不忘此事。惟其　得，是以興趣更濃。</p>
<p>即如徐世昌（水竹村人），事變起後兩年（二十八年），病故大津，　登八十有五。他是淸光緒壬午舉人，須至民國三十一年八十八歲，纔夠上『重宴鹿鳴」的年齡，相差三年。他二十八歲中舉，還不算太晚，享壽八十五，不爲不高，尙且趕不上鄉榜的第二「甲子」。兪曲園老人趕上重鄕舉，趕不上重會徬。近人中鄕會兩次重逢者，一人爲闖人陳寳琛（溥儀的老師），同治甲子科舉人，戊辰科進士，至民國十三年又逢甲子，時年七十七歲。民國十七年又逢戊成，八十一歲。又過了七年，民國二十四年壽終。他具有兩個優美條件，（一）科名特早（二十一歲就成進士了）；（二）壽高（八十八歲）；所以如此從容。又一人爲為人張英麟，淸咸豐戊午科舉人，至民國七年戊午重逢鄉舉；同治乙丑科進士，至民國十四年又逢乙丑；但旋即下世，壽亦八十有八。又一人爲蘇人吳郁生，光緒乙亥舉人（陳　龍的同年），時年二十二，至民國二十四年又逢乙亥；其進士爲丁丑科，二十四歲，至民國二十六年（七七事變之年）又逢丁丑。又過四年，壽終靑島。他亦具備「科名早」「壽高」兩條件。（以上三人都入翰林。</p>
<p>瞿鴻　二十二歲成進士入翰林（同治辛未科），科名是很早，可惜壽止六十九歲，民國八年戊午逝於上海。（若活到民國十九年庚午，纔龍重逢鄕榜；二十年辛未，纔能重逢會榜。）而如　孑民（元培），熊秉三（希齡），都是二十多歲的舉人進士，少年科甲，惜乎壽數都不及八旬。（蔡熊皆於事變之初逝於香港，蔡甫逾七十，熊不到七十。）</p>
<p>今年舊歷戊子，北平有兩個够上重逢鄉舉年齡的人。一　康，因偽職被罪獲釋後病故。一傳增湘，則久病半身不能行動。所以亦無甚慶祝可行。</p>

<h3>Political Yuan Passes Revised General Budget, Determines Tax Rates on Direct Goods, and Sets Salary Increase/Decrease Percentages for Civil and Military Positions in Various Regions; Promulgates Measures to Streamline Financial Subsidies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Following the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, changes have been made to issues such as tax rates and provincial and municipal government expenditures.

These four proposals were submitted for discussion at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 25th, passed, and immediately ordered for implementation. Regarding the general budget for revenue and expenditure, revenue has increased due to tax adjustments and the calculation method has been changed to using gold yuan. On the expenditure side, there are also changes due to adjustments in soldier pay and increases after changes to public servant pay regulations. The plan will be revised and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The revision of provincial and municipal budgets was drafted by the Local Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance, based on the currency reform, and is being revised again. The supplementary measures for streamlining tax revenue were discussed in detail at the meeting on the 25th. Basic principles have been decided for direct taxes, commodity taxes, salt taxes, etc. The supplementary regulations for the disbursement of salaries for civil and military public servants, soldiers, police, laborers, and servants have also been finalized, based on the principles in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, and with reference to past regional divisions. The amount of gold to be issued to each region has been determined, and the multiplier has been confirmed. Soldier pay has also been adjusted, with the lowest amount reportedly being four yuan. All four items will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The principles for adjusting tax rates after the currency reform, as decided at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 25th, are as follows: (1) Direct tax will be levied starting from 300 yuan, increasing progressively, with those above 1.1 million yuan taxed at 30%. (2) The salt tax will be eight yuan per dan (unit of weight). (3) Commodity taxes will be adjusted based on the original prices of August 19th, with reference to pre-war tax rates.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The "Supplementary Regulations for the Disbursement of Salaries for Civil and Military Public Servants, Soldiers, Police, Laborers, and Servants," passed by the Executive Yuan on the 25th, were formulated according to local price levels and with reference to the principles stipulated in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures for increasing or decreasing percentages. Details of the increase/decrease percentages are as follows: Zone 1, including Jinan and Qingdao, will increase by 70%. Zone 2, including Peiping and Tianjin, will increase by 40%. Zone 3, including Xi'an and Zhengzhou, will increase by 20%. Zone 4, including Nanjing and Shanghai, will have no increase or decrease. Zone 5, including Kunming and Guilin, will decrease by 20%. Zone 6, including Chongqing and Chengdu, will decrease by 30%. Zone 7, including Sichuan and Guizhou, will decrease by 40%. Separate measures will be determined for special areas such as Shenyang and Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The proposal to adjust the rationed prices of daily necessities for public servants was submitted for discussion at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 25th. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian first presented a report and explanation of the specific measures drafted by his ministry. However, after conversion to gold yuan, the amounts were mostly one jiao (tenth of a yuan) or a little over one jiao, which was too small. After discussion, it was decided to submit it for review and bring it up for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Presidential Decree: In accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion, and upon the resolution of the Executive Yuan meeting, the Supplementary Measures for Streamlining Finances are hereby promulgated for the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures of August 19th, 1937 of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Cheng Qian Addresses All Hunan Local Tyrants; Personally Writes Proclamation to Issue Stern Warning; Relentless in Evil, Will Not Hesitate to Use Severe Laws</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 25th] Cheng Qian, Director of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters and concurrently Chairman of Hunan Province, personally wrote "A Rebuke to Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry in the Entire Province," a document of several thousand words, which was published in full today. The wording is solemn, citing historical facts of disasters from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign, attributing them to the selfishness of local tyrants and evil gentry, harming the country and afflicting the people, leading to tragic consequences. It warns that if they continue to be relentless in their evil deeds and cover up their wrongdoing, he will not hesitate to use severe laws. This proclamation is a rare and important document from a senior military and political leader since the Northern Expedition, targeting local tyrants and evil gentry as objects of the revolution. All parties here attach great importance to it.</p>
<h3>ECA Aid to China; Can Indirectly Support Gold Yuan; US Will Not Make Loans to Stabilize Currency</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, August 24th] According to well-informed sources: Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China can be indirectly used to support China's gold yuan. However, US authorities and international lending institutions have stated that they are unaware of any measures taken by the Chinese government to obtain support for the new currency. Nanjing has also denied it in the same way, but these rumors continue to reach the United States.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund has not yet formally approved the new exchange rate of four gold yuan to one US dollar, so China cannot obtain IMF assistance. As for the World Bank, it does not make loans to stabilize the currency except for loans for special development projects. And in any case, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund take consistent steps and will not provide loans to governments whose currency exchange rates have not been approved by the IMF.</p>
<p>At the same time, the US Export-Import Bank does not make loans to stabilize the currency. A spokesman for the Treasury Department said: It is impossible for the Treasury Department to make such loans now.</p>
<p>According to experts, it is very likely that a portion of the Chinese currency obtained from the sale of ECA materials will be used to stabilize the new currency, subject to the conditions agreed by the ECA. They said: This move requires "clearing" some accumulated paper money to stabilize the currency.</p>
<p>That is to say, the government must stop the circulation of some accumulated local currency, which will reduce the fundamental cause of China's inflation, which is fiscal deficits.</p>
<p>The ECA said: All loans are now for reconstruction projects, and there are no plans to use ECA funds to support the new currency.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Economic Control Committee; Holds First Meeting Today; Car and Boat Ticket Prices and Freight Rates Will Not Be Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Executive Yuan Economic Control Committee, established due to the currency reform, has decided to hold its first meeting on the 26th, chaired by Premier Weng Wenhao. The committee will actively launch its work to promote various measures to stabilize the economy. In addition, the measures to control prices and crack down on hoarding and speculation formulated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to cooperate with the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures were originally scheduled to be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting on the 25th for discussion. However, since the original case sent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was too late, the Executive Yuan did not have time to print it and did not have time to review it, so it was not submitted on the 25th. It is now learned that it will be submitted for discussion at the first meeting of the Economic Control Committee on the 26th. After a preliminary decision is made, it will be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. The task of the committee is to plan and supervise price controls and to plan and control the crackdown on speculation, hoarding, and illegal operations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Executive Yuan has decided to appoint Xu Boyuan as the Secretary-General of the Yuan's Economic Control Committee. The previous report that Liu Gongyun would take the post was incorrect.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Yesterday, it was rumored that the price increase of transportation businesses would be discussed at the Executive Yuan Political Affairs Meeting on the 25th. According to responsible personnel of the Executive Yuan, the Political Affairs Meeting today will not discuss this matter. It also stated that the ticket prices for seats on trains and ships, which are used by ordinary people, will be based on the ticket prices on August 19th, and freight rates are closely related to prices and cannot be increased.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Treasury Bills; Decision to Stop Issuance</h3>
<p>Issuance of Gold Yuan Bonds Pending</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After the currency reform, the issuance of short-term treasury bills issued by the Central Bank in the past has been decided to be stopped. Those sold before July 20th will be recovered by the Central Bank. As for the issuance of gold yuan bonds, the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance is still studying it. However, the first priority will be to reorganize the old public debt and formulate a method for calculating the conversion of legal tender into gold yuan. The issuance of new gold yuan bonds will take place after the reorganization of the old public debt is completed.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lisheng Arrives in Peiping; Convenes Talks with Heads of Various Agencies; Listens to Execution of Financial and Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 25th] Zhang Lisheng, Economic Control Supervisor of the Tianjin District, flew from Shanghai to Peiping on the morning of the 25th at 10:30 AM, accompanied by Xia Jinxiong and Gong Fuzhou. Liu Duoquan, Song Kentang, Deputy Commanders of the North China Suppression Headquarters, and Chu Xichun, Chairman of Hebei Province, and Liu Yaozhang, Mayor of Peiping, all went to the airport to welcome him. Mr. Zhang rested briefly after entering the city and then went to the North China Suppression Headquarters in the western suburbs to attend a banquet hosted by Fu Zuoyi, with the heads of various agencies accompanying him. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, he convened talks with the heads of agencies such as the Provincial and Municipal Government, the Senate, the National Bank, and the Financial Control Bureau at the Municipal Government to listen to the implementation of emergency financial and economic measures in the past two days and give instructions. Mr. Zhang is scheduled to convene talks with the heads of Peiping's industrial, commercial, and banking sectors at 4:00 PM on the 26th and will leave for Tianjin after staying in Peiping for three days. It is currently undecided whether he will go to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Whether We Can Overcome the Difficulties; Depends on Financial and Economic Reform</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Hopes for Assistance from Compatriots in the North</p>
<p>Zhang Lisheng met with reporters after getting off the plane and said: Please pay attention to the President's determination to reform finance and economy this time. We must strictly implement it. We dare not say that the overall plan has no problems, but we will never allow it to affect the whole. Whether the government can overcome the difficulties depends on how this reform goes, so I sincerely hope for the assistance of compatriots in the North. Regarding the special environment in the Northeast, the government has overall considerations. Without affecting the overall interests, it will never allow any place to be neglected. The materials most needed in the Northeast will be improved. The problem now is still transportation. Mr. Xia Jinxiong is here and will solve the issue of remittances between Guan Nei (inner China) and Guan Wai (outer China) at the same time. Regarding price controls, the government will also handle them carefully and will never allow merchants to raise prices without reason. If a price increase is necessary, it must first be approved by the government. Regarding the foreign assets of Chinese citizens, the government has its own methods, but it cannot tell people in advance. According to Xia Jinxiong, the government will also start with the budget when improving the remittance problem between Guan Nei and Guan Wai.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan's Finance and Transportation Committee; To Discuss Three Important Cases Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Control Yuan's Finance and Transportation Committee is scheduled to hold a joint symposium at 3:00 PM on the 26th to discuss the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures. The central topics of the discussion have been decided, roughly as follows: (1) The price increase of state-owned enterprises is inappropriate and will affect prices. (2) The salaries of public servants are too low, while some prices are based on pre-war levels, which may affect the morale of public servants. (3) The candidates for the Supervisory Committee for the Issuance of Gold Yuan are inappropriate, which may cause difficulties in the implementation of laws.</p>
<h3>Joint US Aid Meeting Held Yesterday; Passage of Establishing Cotton Subcommittee; Personnel for Industrial Construction Subcommittee Decided; President Invites Ambassador Leighton Stuart and Others to a Banquet</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee and the US Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch held their fourth joint symposium at 3:00 PM on the 25th at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence, chaired by Premier Weng. Participants from the US Aid Committee included Deputy Chairman Yu Hongjun, Committee Members Wang Shijie, Yu Dawei (represented by Jin Shixuan), Wang Yunwu (represented by Xu Boyuan), Yan Jiagan, Secretary-General Shen Xirui, Deputy Secretary-General Wu Xueqian, Technical Corps Member Li Gan, and Dong Lin, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Participants from the US ECA Branch included Branch Director Leighton Stuart and Stimpson, John Shen, Hoven C. Kreiling, Griffin, and Gus Shep. Important reports included: (1) Report on US aid materials to China as of August 20th, (2) Report on negotiating with chartered banks to handle US aid financial transactions. According to the US ECA regulations, only US banks are allowed to handle financial transactions. The Central Bank has signed credit agreements with nine banks including Citibank and Chase. Matters discussed and decided included: (1) Construction funds and industrial parts. The original construction fund of 60 million yuan and industrial parts of 10 million yuan were discussed and decided at this joint meeting after Stimpson went to Washington to consult with the US Economic Cooperation Administration. Both parties agreed that China urgently needs to restore production, and it is especially appropriate to reorganize and supplement the existing industrial, mining, and transportation equipment. Therefore, it was decided to use 35 million yuan for industrial parts, and the remainder will be used for rural rehabilitation, some US dollar expenses, and engineering design expenses.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun's Visit to Japan</h3>
<p>Former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun left Shanghai for Japan on the 21st in a private capacity to conduct an observation tour. In addition to his wife, he was accompanied by external advisor Shao Yulin. After Zhang arrived in Tokyo, he issued a statement declaring that this trip was purely an observational tour in a private capacity. He also expressed his gratitude to MacArthur for the generous hospitality he received when he passed through Japan on his return from the United States in 1945. Zhang further stated: The progress of peaceful and democratic construction in post-war Japan is the guarantee of Japan's national revival, and also the foundation for a permanent cooperative relationship between Japan and China, as well as other countries in the world. Everyone who cares about Japan and the overall situation in the world shares this view. Therefore, he declared that this trip was undertaken with this sentiment and expectation. It is heard that in the past few days, in addition to meeting with Prime Minister Ashida and visiting MacArthur, Shigeru Yoshida of the Democratic Liberal Party, Tetsu Katayama of the Social Democratic Party, and even former Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara have all wanted to meet with Zhang. This shows that the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese government and public not only welcome Zhang's trip very much, but also regard him as a guest of honor. South Korean President Syngman Rhee even telegraphed an invitation for Zhang to visit Korea. From a courtesy standpoint, it is impossible to refuse the invitation of the South Korean President. In that case, Zhang's observation tour will at least extend to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>There have been many rumors about Zhang's trip to Japan for observation, and opinions differ. Although these rumors are based on conjecture or speculation, it is clear that they are being taken seriously by all parties. There are several reasons for this importance: (1) Zhang is a former Premier of China and holds an important position in domestic politics. He is an expert on Japan, regarded by the world as China's "Japan expert," and before the war, he presided over diplomatic relations with Japan. Therefore, this visit to Japan is naturally attracting attention. (2) The peace treaty with Japan has not been concluded, and diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been restored. Under MacArthur's control, Japan originally restricted private travel, but this time Zhang was able to go to Japan for observation in a private capacity and receive generous hospitality from MacArthur, which can be said to be an unprecedented exception. (3) The wave of anti-support for Japan in the country is surging, and the movements between the United States and Japan are attracting attention. Zhang's visit to Japan at this time, and the fact that he is a guest of honor of MacArthur, shows the great significance of this trip. We do not want to make premature conjectures about Zhang's trip. However, since Zhang has stated that he "came with expectations" for the "peaceful and democratic construction of post-war Japan," it is natural that this private trip, in addition to its observational nature, will have more or less gains. What should we expect? What should we gain? We would like to express some opinions from the standpoint of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>First, although Japan surrendered three years ago, there are no signs of peaceful and democratic progress in the current political, economic, and social situation in Japan. The provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, the basic policy towards Japan resolved by the Far Eastern Commission, and the reparations plan passed by the Far Eastern Commission have rarely been implemented in the past three years, or there are distances after implementation. Our country's policy towards Japan was originally generous and not retaliatory. The Japanese are aware of this. The spirit of the Potsdam Declaration is based on non-retaliation, and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission tend to be more generous. Therefore, our expectation for the progress of peaceful and democratic construction in Japan should not deviate from the norms of these documents. We can only expect that the clauses revealed in these documents will be taken seriously by all parties and that there will be a guarantee of implementation before we can obtain true peace and democracy in Japan.</p>
<p>Second, the three cabinets of Yoshida, Katayama, and Ashida under the new constitution have not achieved much since taking office and have not created a democratic and progressive future for the Japanese people, which is regrettable. The opposition parties are complex and of a low level. Enlightened and liberal people are unwilling to compete with conservative bureaucratic politics for official careers, or they are parasitic in academic institutions or hidden in the fields. These are the biggest losses to Japan's peaceful and democratic progress. If our country wants to promote Japan, to support a progressive Japan, we should acquire truly enlightened, liberal, and progressive people and promote their unity into a force so that they can play a role in metabolism in politics and work for a good future relationship between China and Japan. The current political situation in Japan needs to be changed, and the progress of future Japanese politics should be expected to be far-reaching. If Japan still uses the same set of people as before the war to look at China and interact with China, and China also uses the same set of methods and understandings as before the war to deal with Japan, it may not be a blessing for the future of East Asia.</p>
<p>Third, the only way to settle the Japanese issue and clarify the disputes over the Far East's Japanese issue is to convene a Japanese peace conference, conclude a peace treaty with Japan, carry out control according to the treaty, and revive Japan according to the treaty, thereby eliminating the unhappiness between countries. There is now a way to break the stalemate in convening a Japanese peace conference. Among the attitudes of various countries, countries such as Britain, Australia, and the Philippines are in favor of convening a peace conference. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Japanese peace conference may not be firmly rejected. The key at present seems to be in the United States, and the key to the United States is in MacArthur. As long as a way to break the stalemate is found in this regard, the peace conference may succeed within this year. As for the attitude within Japan, the Democratic Liberal Party (led by Yoshida) and the Democratic Party (led by Ashida), which represent conservative forces, do not welcome the peace conference. These parties want to use the state of no treaty to create a de facto situation that Japan can be revived immediately. These practices are for the sake of the party, not for the future of peace and democracy in Japan. The Socialist Party under Katayama and some liberals expect to convene a peace conference as soon as possible, which is a forward-looking view and worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The above three points are our expectations for the study of the Japanese issue, and also our expectations for Zhang's visit to Japan. Even if Zhang's trip is a private visit, if he can gain something in this regard, then Zhang's observation tour will bring significant historical significance, and it can be said that he did not make this trip in vain.</p>
<h3>Siam Violates Treaty by Arbitrarily Arresting Overseas Chinese, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Serious Protest, Urges Immediate Release and No Recurrence of Similar Actions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently sent a memorandum to the Siamese representative in China, Xian Ya, on the 17th, lodging a strong protest against the Siamese government's arbitrary arrest of overseas Chinese in Siam, which violated its obligations under the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. The ministry requested that the Siamese government be informed immediately to release the arrested overseas Chinese and to strictly order the Siamese police authorities to prevent similar actions from happening again. On June 15th of this year, the Bangkok police department arrested more than 50 overseas Chinese. Upon receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed the embassy and consulate in Siam to investigate the reasons for the arrest in order to negotiate. However, despite repeated inquiries by our embassy and consulates in Siam, Siam did not respond. More than two months have passed. The Siamese authorities have neither notified the Chinese consulate of the reasons for the arrest of the overseas Chinese, nor have they announced the charges against them. According to Article 5 of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, the protection of the physical and property safety enjoyed by overseas Chinese in Siam is the same as that enjoyed by the Siamese people. However, the Siamese police authorities recently used secret societies and illegal fundraising as excuses and suddenly arrested overseas Chinese on a large scale in various places based on old regulations promulgated ten years ago. Siamese newspapers also revealed news that all the arrested overseas Chinese would be deported, creating a terrible situation that made all the overseas Chinese in Siam feel insecure and panicked all day long. The Siamese side's large-scale arrest of overseas Chinese without following legal procedures is contrary to the letter and spirit of the aforementioned regulations. If they are deported, the property of the overseas Chinese will suffer significant losses. At a time when the issue of overseas Chinese education in Siam is being discussed by our embassy in Siam and Siam, the Chinese government particularly hopes that Siam will stop all actions in violation of the treaty to avoid hindering the traditional friendly relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 25th] The newly appointed Siamese Ambassador to China, Apiban, is expected to leave here soon to take up his post. Yesterday, he paid a special visit to Prince Chainat, Chairman of the Regency Council, and bid farewell to all members.</p>

<h3>Exchange of Gold Notes Unabated, Merchants Who Raise Prices Can't Escape the Law</h3>
<p>Capital - Seven Profiteers Sent to Criminal Court</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] On the third day of the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificate, the capital was experiencing drizzling autumn rain, but people still flocked to the Central Bank with gold, silver, and foreign currency to exchange them.

The special criminal court today summoned the directors of the relevant industries, ordering them to sell at the prices of the 19th of this month, otherwise they would be dealt with according to law. The provincial capital police局 issued a written statement, urging merchants to support the new currency and not to disrupt the financial market again. In addition, the law enforcement team of the Eighth Pacification Zone dispatched personnel today to assist in the arrest of profiteering merchants.</p>
<p>Xuzhou - Profiteering Merchants Paraded</p>

It is generally hoped that the government will issue more subsidiary coins to help.</p>
<p>Jinan - Exchange Situation Good</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] On the third day of the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates, the various exchange offices were still crowded.

<h3>Various Institutions in Northeast China Rush to Create Budgets, Prepare to Implement Public Treasury System, Political Committee is Studying Plans to Cooperate with New Measures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 25th] In order for currency reform to be implemented smoothly in the Northeast, the special system of the Northeast economy must be abolished, so the public treasury system must be established in order to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. Commander Wei has fully considered this point, because the current military and political expenditures in the Northeast are huge. If there are no restrictions, it will inevitably create a crisis of new currency inflation, and it will be difficult to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood. The Northeast Political Committee recently ordered various provincial and municipal institutions to rush to create budgets, which are said to be in preparation for the implementation of the public treasury system. In addition, in order to thoroughly implement the emergency disposal order for financial economy, the Political Committee is studying a matching plan, which focuses on two points: (1) Merge redundant agencies to save expenses, such as the exiled provincial government and the Northeast transportation departments will be abolished or reduced. (2) Strengthen air transportation and sale of materials to stabilize prices. It is reported that the Northeast authorities will soon send senior officials to Beijing to request instructions on issues such as streamlining, layoffs, material supply, and Northeast exchange restrictions. The environment in the Northeast is special, and there must be other solutions.</p>

<h3>Stalin Agrees to Joint Control of Berlin Currency by Western Nations; Suggests Convening a Four-Power Meeting of Financial Experts to Draft an Agreement; Acknowledges the Right of the US, Britain, and France to Remain in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast: According to well-informed diplomatic circles, Stalin has suggested convening a four-power meeting of financial experts in Berlin to draft an agreement on the control of Berlin currency. The ambassadors of the US, Britain, and France have separately reported to their governments and advocated accepting this suggestion. This suggestion implies two meanings: (1) The Soviet Union has agreed in principle to the Western nations' demand to participate in the management of the Berlin economy; (2) The Soviet Union recognizes the Western powers' right to continue occupying Berlin. This suggestion was made by Stalin during a meeting in the Kremlin on Monday night. Drafting an agreement on the control of Berlin currency by financial experts can eliminate the main obstacles to resolving the problem, and its main purpose is still to lift the Berlin blockade.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast: Western powers' ambassadors believe that the Soviet Union may soon agree to rebuild the four-power control system in Berlin. There are three steps to implement this: First, the Soviet Union recognizes that the Western Allies have the right to continue to stay in Berlin and participate in Berlin's politics together with the Soviet Union. Second, the East German mark is the currency for the entire Berlin area, and the Western powers can jointly control the currency. Third, lift the Berlin blockade and ensure that the Western powers have the right to pass through the Soviet occupation zone to their respective occupation zones. External spokespersons said that as of now, there have been no further appointments for meetings.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast: According to well-informed diplomatic sources, after a brief review of the current situation created by the Moscow negotiations, the governments of the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may issue a joint communiqué.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson said that the next meeting between the Western envoys in the Soviet Union and Kremlin officials is not yet ready because the Western nations still need to consult each other, especially the opinions of the Western representatives in Germany. It is expected that US Ambassador to Britain Douglas, French Ambassador Massigli, and British Soviet expert Under Secretary of State Strang will meet again tonight.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The US, British, and French governments are now studying Stalin's proposal and will not be able to make a decision on it until after forty-eight hours. Informed sources say that the three strong capitals are now studying the consequences of accepting and rejecting Stalin's proposal overnight. It is believed that this proposal includes the entire German question, not just the Berlin question. However, after the three strong powers have made a preliminary review, they may accept it. Officials refuse to reveal anything about this point. According to reliable sources, even if the three strong powers finally accept Stalin's proposal, it may not be equal to the three strong powers making concessions that they originally thought were unacceptable.</p>
<h3>Berlin Suddenly Turns Quiet; Soviet Commander Sends Letter to Mayor Schroeder; Orders Not Permitted by the Soviets are Invalid</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Army Commander of the Berlin Soviet Zone, Kotikov, wrote to Mayor Schroeder stating that the Soviet military government finds it difficult to accept the decisions and orders of the municipal government authorities. All orders are invalid without the permission of the Soviet military government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 25th] Berlin Soviet Military Commander Kotikov today ordered the post office in the Berlin Soviet area to re-examine and issue permits for various periodicals and daily newspapers. The deadline for re-registration is September 1. Kotikov's order is tantamount to formally prohibiting the circulation of newspapers in the Western occupation zones in the Soviet zone. For several months, the newspapers could only be secretly circulated in the Soviet zone.</p>
<p>Since the US side informally suggested that the police in the two parts of divided Berlin cooperate with each other, it is expected that the Soviet side will respond on the 25th. For a week, Berlin has been filled with riots, demonstrations, and kidnappings every day. This morning, it suddenly became calm, and the newspapers turned their attention to the recent negotiations in Moscow.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 24th] Lieutenant Donner, the US military government chief of Kirchgengen who was arrested by the Soviet army yesterday while on patrol, and another US soldier, have been released today. Donner and his companion said that they accidentally entered the Soviet occupation zone while on patrol and were detained.

<h3>Membership Applications from Outer Mongolia and Other Countries Will Be Discussed by the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>Security Council Submits Review Report</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 24th] The Security Council today submitted a special report to the United Nations General Assembly, summarizing the status of the Security Council's review of applications from various countries to join the United Nations. Currently, the applicants for membership in the United Nations include Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Outer Mongolia, Portugal, Romania, Transjordan, and Ceylon, totaling thirteen countries. The applications of each country have been initially considered by last year's General Assembly, and are currently under review by the Security Council. It is believed that if the Security Council does not approve the participation of countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Finland, and Outer Mongolia, the Soviet Union will also not support the applications of countries such as Italy, Austria, Portugal, Transjordan, and Ireland. Therefore, the Security Council decided to report this situation to the General Assembly without making any recommendations. At the suggestion of Argentina, this year's United Nations General Assembly will discuss the issue of new member states joining. Argentina believes that any country that receives seven votes of support in the Security Council can join the United Nations. In other words, Argentina advocates that the participation of new member states should not be restricted by the veto power.</p>
<h3>Complete Freedom of Travel in the US and French Occupation Zones in Germany</h3>

<h3>Albania Decides to Detain Greek Government Troops if They Cross the Border</h3>
<p>Albanian Government Sends Note to the United Nations</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tirana, 24th] The Albanian government has notified UN Secretary-General Laiyi that Albanian guards will detain any Greek government troops who invade Albanian territory. In the note, the Albanian government protested the accusations made against Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia by the United Nations Balkan Committee on August 12, and argued that the accusations violated the interests of peace and that the Balkan Committee had become a tool in the hands of war mongers. Finally, the Albanian government emphasized in the note that if Greece abandons its aggressive attitude, Albania is willing to resume negotiations with it and establish normal diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tirana, 24th] The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that in the past three days, 247 wounded Greek democratic soldiers surrendered to the Albanian border guards. After the soldiers were disarmed, they were sent to various hospitals for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wallace Declares He Is Not a Communist</h3>
<p>The Progressive Party Is Also Not Controlled by the Communist Party</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ohio] Wallace issued a written statement to the press today, saying, "I am not a Communist Party member, and I have never participated in the Communist Party." The Progressive Party is determined not to be controlled by the Communist Party, and the Progressive Party's platform is determined not to be influenced by the Communist Party. He said that communism and progressives are vastly different from capitalism, and that the two parties may have some similarities in certain social facilities. According to Wallace's opinion, there are two types of communist parties in the United States, one that attempts to overthrow the US government by force, and the other that does not. The Third Party only wants to take joint action with the latter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Wallace's statement was obviously made for a reason, because recently, all parties have accused the Progressive Party of becoming a "foreign" organization of the Communist Party. This accusation will cause the Progressive Party to lose the support of many free people.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Suddenly Orders the Closure of Two Soviet Consulates in New York and San Francisco; Demands the US to Close Its Consulate in Vladivostok</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The Soviet Union ordered on the 24th to "immediately" close the Soviet consulates in New York and San Francisco, and demanded that the United States also close its consulate in Vladivostok and stop trying to open a US consulate in Leningrad. The Soviet Union submitted a note to the White House, stating that the reason for the Soviet Union's decision was that it believed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, together with the White Russians, had infringed on the freedom of Soviet citizens in the United States. The Kremlin again denied that its own consulate officials had interfered with the freedom of two Soviet teachers in New York.</p>
<p>The note stated that the Soviet consulates in New York and San Francisco would be closed immediately, and in accordance with the policy of reciprocity, the United States would also be required to close its consulate in Vladivostok. The note also stated that the Soviet government believed that the agreement in progress that stipulated that the United States could open a consulate in Leningrad was automatically cancelled due to the actions of the United States. The White House has confirmed that it has received the note. This incident occurred when leading officials of Western countries were pessimistic about the Moscow meeting and are now more cautiously optimistic. The State Department, due to the abuse of power and violation of the standards of official proper conduct by the Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomokin, issued a strong note ordering Lomokin to leave the country. The points of reprimand made by the State Department were based on Lomokin's detention of Mrs. Kosenkina and Mrs. Kosenkina's jumping out of the window from the fourth floor of the Soviet consulate.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Government Supports Lomokin's Actions</h3>
<p>The Soviet official news agency TASS reported on the 24th that the Soviet government fully endorsed all the actions taken by Lomokin in handling the matter. It was reported that the Soviet reply stated that the Soviet side had "many documents" sufficient to prove that Mrs. Kosenkina and another escaped teacher, Samarin, had been kidnapped, and that the Tolstoy Foundation of the White Russians and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had participated in the matter. TASS continued that the recent Soviet note was submitted to the State Department by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin. TASS broadcast on Moscow Radio, "The Soviet government believes that the contents of the US note on August 19 (which rejected Panyushkin's protest and ordered Lomokin to leave the country) are unfounded and inconsistent with the facts." Moscow Radio also broadcast the full text of the US notes rejecting the protests of Panyushkin and Molotov. The Soviet Union said that the United States deliberately avoided the facts and failed to provide any assistance in clarifying the ambiguous points in the kidnapping case. Moscow also said that the US note "only prevents the clarification of this case and the parts in which certain individuals and groups participated in this case."</p>
<h3>US Commander in Chief in Korea, Hodge, Returns Home Tomorrow; And Issues a Farewell Letter to the Korean People</h3>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 25th] Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander in Chief of the US National Army in South Korea, condemned the Korean Communist Party and its fellow travelers in his farewell letter to the Korean people on the 25th, "who are trying to sell your country and make it a slave under foreign dictatorship." Hodge said that in the three years he stayed in Korea, he admired the Korean people quite a bit. He asked the Korean leaders to "abandon all selfish and personal ambitions and work entirely for the happiness of the entire Republic of Korea." He expressed confidence in the future success of the Republic of Korea. At the same time, State Department representative Gergeb will also leave here on the 26th and return to Washington. Gergeb will be the Far East liaison officer for the US delegation to the Third Plenary Session of the United Nations in Paris to participate in the UN General Assembly's consideration of the Korean issue. Gergeb said he believed that the General Assembly would approve the election in South Korea under UN supervision.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Kosenkina's Press Conference Canceled Again Temporarily</h3>
<p>She Had Intended to Announce the Details of the Jump from the Building</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] Mrs. Kosenkina had agreed on the 24th to announce her own experience of jumping out of the Soviet Consulate, but it was finally canceled temporarily. A police officer said when preventing reporters from entering Mrs. Kosenkina's ward in Roosevelt Hospital, "She is stimulated and feels tired and does not want to see anyone." Newsreel and newspaper photographers had been to Mrs. Kosenkina's room, and hospital authorities said that their flashbulbs had frightened Mrs. Kosenkina. When reporters approached the ward, Mrs. Kosenkina called the doctor to tell him that she felt unable to meet visitors. Her internist Ford and surgeon Pannoye then canceled the reporters' visit. The hospital originally intended to allow a small number of reporters to enter, but more than a dozen people tried to crowd in. The reporters had been waiting since morning, intending to hear Mrs. Kosenkina's own account of her jump from the window of the Soviet Consulate, and they had previously submitted thirteen written questions. The hospital nurse said that when the questions were read to Mrs. Kosenkina, she nodded frequently to indicate her approval. The reporters had raised money to buy flowers for Mrs. Kosenkina.</p>
<h3>New Witness Peters Scheduled to Be Questioned on the 30th</h3>
<p>Announced by the House Un-American Activities Committee</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The House Un-American Activities Committee announced on the 24th that it had determined the whereabouts of the long-sought Peters and would summon him for questioning on the 30th. Peters is the former leader of the so-called US Communist Party underground and has been charged with deportation for secret activities, and is currently out on bail. The committee has been searching for Peters for a long time because he is related to the committee's investigation into the Communist Party's espionage organization within the wartime government. According to Congressman Mede, the committee had received a notice from the US Immigration Bureau stating that Peters would attend the deportation hearing in New York at 10:00 AM on the 30th.

<h3>Defected South Korean Military Officer Criticizes the Tito Regime</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bucharest, 25th] Major General Bopibufda, who defected from Yugoslavia ten days ago and is now seeking refuge in Romania, said on the 25th that if the Tito regime continues to oppose Moscow's connections, its demise can be predicted. Bop criticized Tito and other senior South Korean leaders for their nationalistic tendencies. He also said that they used secret police to deal with "loyal communists" in Yugoslavia. He said, "If the current leaders of the party continue to follow the national road and send the party on its way, then the people and the party in our country will surely rise up and start over." According to a Belgrade report last week, the day before General Yuvalnovich was killed, the authorities announced that Bop and another general had flown a plane to an undisclosed area. It also said that the escape of South Korean military officers indicated that they were plotting to establish a government in exile in neighboring countries to plot the overthrow of Tito.</p>
<h3>Mutual Closure of Consulates by the US and the Soviet Union Does Not Affect Negotiations in Moscow</h3>
<p>Marshall Believes That the Soviet Action Is Not a Serious Development</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast, Moscow: Reliable sources believe that although the Soviet Union has severed consular relations with the United States, it will not affect the negotiations on the Berlin and other issues. Soviet newspapers prominently published the Soviet note on the Kosenkina case, but did not express any opinions.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Washington, 25th Broadcast: US Secretary of State Marshall said at a press conference that the closure of the Soviet consulates in the United States and the US consulate in Vladivostok was regrettable but not unexpected. He said the US has accepted the Soviet request and will close the Vladivostok consulate. This matter is not serious, as the activities of the consulate staff there have long been restricted and they cannot fully perform their duties. Marshall added that in the future, Soviet diplomatic affairs in the United States can be handled by the Soviet Embassy, and US consular affairs in the Soviet Union can be handled by the consular staff in the US Embassy in Moscow. Finally, he said that US officials were not surprised by the Soviet decision to close the consulates and emphasized that this decision was not a severance of diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>Interruption of Navigation Between Rangoon and Bassein</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] A State Department official recently denied rumors that Burma had directly requested weapons and equipment from the United States to fight the communists. Meanwhile, it was learned by reporters that the US had previously agreed to the UK transferring a small amount of leased supplies held by the UK in the Middle East to Burma. US officials emphasized that the UK and Burma still have military ties, and Burma will hold direct negotiations on military assistance with the UK. Some officials believe that the UK's need for military supplies in Malaya makes it impossible for the UK to transfer a large amount of leased supplies in the Straits area to Burma. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Burmese Embassy in the US said that they had no knowledge of rumors that Burma had requested weapons from the US to quell the rebellion threatening Rangoon.</p>

The "Cabot" will resume operations in mid-October, and the eight destroyers will resume operations in January next year. The 45,000-ton "Iowa" belongs to the Pacific Fleet.

The "Iowa" will be transferred to the reserve team like the other thirteen battleships but can be called upon to serve at any time. A public announcement from the Navy stated that "since the end of World War II, underwater operations have undergone revolutionary changes, especially in offensive operations.

<h3>Social Bureau Re-advises All Industries to Adhere to August 19th Fixed Prices; Paint Industry Points Out That Exchange Rates Affect Raw Material Prices</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Social Bureau continued to summon responsible persons from various industries in the city yesterday to talk, advising them to abide by government orders and not exceed the August 19th price. The result was very good.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Paint Industry Association stated that the industry would automatically adjust to the August 14th price, but there were two difficulties that must be resolved: (1) Raw material difficulties. If the price of products from Chinese vegetable oil factories rises, it will inevitably affect the industry and should be prevented. (2) The original exchange certificate price was only 8.5 million, but now it has increased to 12 million, which means that the price of raw materials purchased from abroad has already increased and should be addressed.</p>
<p>The cigarette industry also stated that it would not raise prices, but hoped that taxes would not be increased. If the government increases taxes, then according to the principle of "the wool comes from the sheep," the price of cigarettes will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>The Porcelain Industry States That It Has Not Increased Prices</p>
<p>The Porcelain Industry Association stated that the rumor that the industry has increased by 10-20% is inaccurate. This is because the industry has wholesale prices and retail prices. The retail price was originally higher than the wholesale price. The current change is from the wholesale price to the retail price, and there has been no actual increase. The Social Bureau instructed the person in charge of the bureau to send a copy of the wholesale and retail prices of August 19th to the bureau for review.</p>
<p>High Fresh Meat Prices Blamed on Production Area</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry stated that it has suppressed the retail price to around 2 million per catty. However, the price on August 19th was based on the price of pork purchased from the Subei production area on August 10th. The current price should be based on the price of pork in the Subei production area on August 19th. Because the taxes and fees in the Subei Pacification Zone are very heavy, the price in the production area on August 19th has already risen sharply. If the Social Bureau limits the price based on the price of pork in Shanghai on August 19th, it may not be able to be maintained for long. The Social Bureau will submit this matter to the municipal government and then to the Executive Yuan to request that the Subei Pacification Zone pay attention.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau will continue to summon the persons in charge of the tung oil industry, the cigarette industry, and the tobacco leaf industry today to declare the points that should be noted regarding the price issue.</p>
<h3>Sugar Quotations Subject to Approval and Sale Must Not Exceed Regulations</h3>

A total of 23,512 packages were applied for by 327 units, and 15,690 packages were approved for 293 units, at 27 yuan and 1 jiao per dan.</p>
<h3>Ten Merchants Suspended from Distribution for Adulterating Household Sugar</h3>

<h3>Hui Minggan Indicted for Espionage, Transferred to Special Criminal Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Acquitted of Instigating Murder</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Hui Minggan, a native of Jiangbei, was the chief of public security for the Communist bandits in Wangji Township, Funing Township in 1945 of the Republic of China. At that time, there was a Hui Mingling. Minggan said that he had political activities (referring to participating in the Kuomintang), so he instigated his younger brother Hui Mingtao to kill him. In the autumn of that year, when the National Army entered Wangji Township to suppress the bandits, Minggan and Hui Shengmao, who was on the run, discussed suppressing the families of the victims, and successively killed Kuomintang members Zhou Xiru and local gentry Dai Lifeng and others to intimidate them. In February of this year, Minggan and Zhang Buda traveled to Shanghai together. Hui Mingling's son Mingzu learned about it and reported it to the Garrison Headquarters, which arrested Minggan. He firmly denied participating in the work of the Communist bandits. Later, after the headquarters telegraphed Funing to reply, it was confirmed that this was the case. Minggan was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation as an instigator of murder and filed a public prosecution. Zhang Buda was sent to the Special Criminal Court for investigation due to the crime of internal rebellion. The District Court opened a court session yesterday and announced that the defendant Hui Minggan was innocent of instigating murder due to lack of conclusive evidence, but he was suspected of espionage and was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial.</p>

<p>In order to thoroughly rectify military discipline, Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, invited the heads of various military agencies in Shanghai and the commanders of various troops to hold a meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday.

<h3>Trial of Okamura Cost 3 Billion, Date of Retrial Undecided, Transfer to Tokyo Inaccurate</h3>
<p>General Okamura Neiji, the number one Japanese war criminal, was publicly tried for the first time by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense in this city on the 23rd. It was found that the collected evidence was insufficient, and it was decided to postpone the retrial for the sake of solemnity. However, the date of the public trial has not yet been decided. It is learned that there are two reasons: (1) It is necessary to collect strong evidence from all relevant parties. (2) Insufficient funds for the public trial. One public trial of Okamura Neiji on the 23rd cost more than 1 billion national currency for the Chinese meal alone. The total cost of preparation and arrangement before and after reached 3 billion, while the public funds allocated by the Ministry of National Defense were not even half of the amount spent. Therefore, the court has once again submitted a request to the Ministry of National Defense for the allocation of funds to facilitate a quick trial. As for the rumor that Okamura Neiji may be transferred to the Tokyo International Tribunal in the near future, the military court stated that it is absolutely inaccurate. Okamura did not participate in the central system organization that invaded China, and his crimes are limited to the facts caused in the Chinese battlefield, so there is no need to transfer him to the Tokyo International Tribunal.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Grain Merchants Urges Exemption from Business Tax</h3>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ma Shuli, a native of Beiping who previously worked in the statistics office of the municipal government, was attracted to Zhang Yunxiu, a female colleague in the same office, because of her attractive appearance and began to pursue her. However, Zhang did not reciprocate Ma's feelings. Although Ma repeatedly harassed her and asked her to marry him, Zhang ignored him. Ma was subsequently dismissed for improper behavior but remained unwilling to give up on Zhang. He even wrote a letter in blood to Zhang, threatening her, but Zhang still did not respond. Seeing that his goal was not achieved, Ma further climbed through the window into Zhang's residence three times, on the 3rd, 16th, and 25th of last month, to profess his love to Zhang. Unable to bear the harassment, Zhang reported the matter to the police, who detained Ma and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning.

<h3>Part of the Fahua Temple, Enemy Property, Appropriated and Occupied, Trial Begins After Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fahua Temple in western Shanghai covers an area of more than 30 mu and has five main halls. During the occupation period, it was occupied by the puppet Security Command as a repair shop. In addition to the main halls, three two-story buildings and two kitchens were built. After the victory, it was taken over by the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense and used as a warehouse, with Ma Houqing appointed as the administrator. In the winter of the previous year, after the materials in the warehouse were cleared out, Ma notified the temple monk Zeng Chang, saying that he was ordered to return the property to the owner. Zeng Chang immediately recognized the property as temple property. Subsequently, Ma colluded with Ma Huifu and rented the above-mentioned property from Zeng Chang, converting it into the Xingji Primary School run by the mosque. One of the telephone lines in the building was illegally transferred by Ma Yifang on January 6 of this year. After investigation by the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, in addition to detaining Ma Houqing and sentencing him to seven years in prison as a soldier, the entire case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The office considered that the temple monk Zeng Chang, Ma Huifu of Xingji Primary School, and Ma Yifang had misappropriated enemy property and filed a joint prosecution against them. Yesterday, the District Court opened a trial, and only Zeng Chang appeared as the defendant. He stated that the temple buildings had been partially built in 1937, but before they were completed, the puppet Security Command continued the construction. Later, Ma Houqing verbally notified him to return the property and introduced him to open a primary school. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date due to the absence of the other defendants, and Zeng Chang was released on his original bail.</p>

<h3>Accusation Against Penglai District Chief, Civil Affairs Bureau Thoroughly Investigates Accounts</h3>

<h3>Experts Participate in Assessing Gold Purity, National Bank States That Claim of Price Depression Is a Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] There have been rumors that when the National Bank buys gold, it deliberately lowers the purity of the gold and forcibly buys it if the seller is unwilling to sell it at a discount. The reporter inquired about this with Deputy Director Li Xiaozhuang of the Business Bureau, who is in charge of the purchase work. According to him, all the rumors are misunderstandings. Regarding the purity of gold, the standard for pure gold stipulated in the financial and economic emergency plan is 1,000 parts per thousand. However, in recent years, most of the gold in this city has not met this standard. Therefore, when buying gold, discounts are made according to the purity of the gold, but there is absolutely no deliberate lowering of the purity. As for forced purchases, it is even more of a misrepresentation. Because gold is purchased in order, the staff hopes that the seller will not change their mind at the last minute to save time, but if they insist on not selling, there is absolutely no compulsion. At the same time, after each tael of gold is purchased, the seller receives a receipt stating the weight and purity. If there are any questions, they can use this receipt to retrieve the original gold for re-examination. Regarding whether there is an objective standard for determining the purity of gold, the Central Bank and other entrusted banks have experts participating in the purchase. Although the accuracy of their determination cannot be compared with melting analysis, it is not far from the actual value.</p>
<h3>Purchase Results Get Better and Better, Yesterday's Total Exceeded Ten Million Yuan</h3>

<h3>Police Officer Injured in Sutaizhou Hotel Case, Batch of Criminals Prosecuted Separately</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Keqin and Zhang Changgui, two police officers from the Criminal Police Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, were arresting the thief Zhang Shujun in the Sutaizhou Hotel at No. 5, Lane 531, Fuzhou Road on June 17 when Xue Lanying, the thief's girlfriend, learned of it. She ran to a man named Lu Baoshan for help, and Lu readily agreed. He led his gang members Sun Guifeng, Lü Songyun, Xu Cunzhi, Zhu Changyin, Sun Rongzhen, Chen Xiaomao, Tan Jinsheng, Jiang Jinshu, etc., in cars and pedicabs to lie in ambush at the entrance of the Sutaizhou Hotel alley, waiting for an opportunity to rescue Zhang Lianjun. Lu Baoshan also gave Sun Guifeng a small machete, instructing her to stab the two police officers. When Wang and Zhang escorted Zhang Lianjun out of the hotel door and were about to get into the car to return to the bureau, Lu Baoshan shouted and ordered his gang members to swarm forward and punch and kick Wang and Zhang. Sun Guifeng then stabbed Wang in the head with the knife. Fortunately, Wang dodged quickly and protected himself with his hand, suffering only a knife wound to the front of his head and a cut on his right wrist. Zhang, due to his strong physique, was only slightly injured. Zhang then fired a warning shot, and Lu and his gang members fled in all directions. The thief Zhang Tongjun also took the opportunity to escape, but was soon captured again in the Jiuanli alley on Hubei Road. On July 12, at about 9:00 AM, Lu Baoshan again incited Sun Guifeng, Lü Songyun, Xu Cunzhi, Sun Rongzhen, and Chen Xiaomao to jointly rob six sections of galvanized iron bars from a truck in front of the Litai Warehouse outside the Dada Wharf and sell them to Zhang Wanbao, who knew about the crime, dividing the proceeds for their own use. Later, Lu led Wang Fengshan, Zhang Ruqing, and others to steal three bags of soybeans from a barge at Dada Wharf No. 3 and were detained and released by the Water Police Sub-Bureau. When Lu and others were dividing the loot at Lu's residence at No. 34 Heng Street, Yangjiadu, in the Nanshi district, the police discovered it and arrested them. Only Jiang Jinshu, Wang Fengshan, and Zhang Ruqing escaped. The rest were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. The office has now completed the investigation and filed public prosecutions against all of the above defendants for attempted murder, assault, escape, robbery, and receiving stolen goods.</p>

<h3>The First Construction Project in Sichuan Province: Dujiang Power Plant</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 22nd] On the day of the triumphant return to the capital, the central government clearly designated Sichuan as a construction experimental province. At that time, under the leadership of Zhang Yuejun, the Sichuan Provincial Government drafted two major post-war construction plans for Sichuan: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dujiang Power Plant. However, three years of banditry and the exhaustion of the people's strength caused the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to experience slow progress due to financial difficulties. Only the Dujiang Power Plant project proceeded smoothly due to the cooperation between the Resources Commission and the Sichuan Provincial Government. After one year and nine months of arduous labor, the first part of the entire project was officially completed last month, with the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant commencing power generation. Therefore, the Dujiang Power Plant is the first construction project in Sichuan after the war.</p>
<p>Surveying Process: World-Renowned Engineers Presided Over the Work</p>
<p>The Dujiang Power Plant is located in Guanxian, western Sichuan, utilizing the world-famous Dujiangyan irrigation system to construct a hydropower project. Our reporter visited Guanxian and conducted a comprehensive interview regarding the plant. First and foremost, the entire project plan and surveying process was initially overseen by Dr. Savage, an American authority on hydraulic engineering. Dr. Savage was employed to come to Sichuan in July of the 33rd year of the Republic, and successively conducted on-site surveys in areas along the Dadu River, Maben River, and the upper reaches of the Min River, selecting Yuzui and Maxi in Guanxian as dam sites. Secondly, in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic, the Wartime Production Bureau specially invited American power transmission experts to guide the Western Sichuan Surveying Office, penetrating deep into the upper reaches of the Min River in western Sichuan for over a year of surveying, completing dam site drilling and hydrological research work. By the 35th year of the Republic, when the Dujiang Power Plant construction plan was established, the Resources Commission sought loans from Canada to start construction. Consequently, a group of Canadian engineers led by Sachs, together with the Hydropower Administration of the Resources Commission, formed an engineering team to survey the dam site in Guanxian and study the Dujiang water power and development procedures. Work was successively completed in March of the 36th year of the Republic. During this period, Dr. Savage, American geological expert Zhong Foou, and American engineer Gan Wenji from the Resources Commission successively came to Guanxian to conduct dam site excavation, geological surveys, and final design work. By April of the 36th year of the Republic, the entire project plan was finalized.</p>
<p>Two Plans: American and Canadian Experts Had Differing Opinions</p>
<p>The grand Dujiang Power Plant project had two plans: One was presided over by Dr. Savage of the United States, which planned to build a 200,000-kilowatt power plant at Yuzui in the upper reaches of Dujiang and a 500,000-kilowatt power plant at Maxi. In addition, a dam was to be built at Yuzui (1,080 meters long, 70 meters high, with a drop of 35 meters), with an estimated total cost of US$50 million and a power generation cost of US$0.025 per kilowatt-hour. After completion, the benefits were estimated to be 60% for irrigation and 40% for power generation, which could electrify the entire western Sichuan Plain. The other plan was presided over by the Canadian engineering team, with completely opposite opinions. They believed that western Sichuan could not digest such a large amount of electricity at all, and that the source of funds and materials were problematic, so the scope should be reduced in principle. Their plan was: First, build a 50,000-kilowatt power plant at Zipingpu in Guanxian, a 50,000-kilowatt power plant at Maliuwan, and a 35,000-kilowatt power plant at Houzipo. In addition, build a 250,000-kilowatt power plant at Xuankou and build a dam at the same time (867 meters long, 78 meters high, with a drop of 40 meters). After careful research by the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Resources Commission, these two major plans decided to agree with and adopt the Canadian engineer's plan. At the same time, since several previous locations were not satisfactory after geological analysis, it was decided to focus on the construction of the Xuankou Power Plant, which is today's Dujiang Power Plant.</p>
<p>Initial Stage of Construction: Two Years of Arduous Construction Completed the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant</p>
<p>After the plan was decided, preparations were made to implement the project. The Resources Commission and the Sichuan Provincial Government jointly established the Dujiang Power Plant to take charge. It was decided to divide the project into two parts: the first part was to build the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant first. Construction began in the 35th year of the Republic. The Resources Commission initially allocated two 2,000-kilowatt generators. After countless twists and turns, one unit was finally received at the end of the 35th year and shipped to Sichuan. However, due to various transportation problems, it took a full ten months for the generator to be dismantled, packaged, and transported to the thermal power plant in Puchun, Guanxian. After another four months of round-the-clock work by the engineering staff, and the erection of the Chengdu-Guanxian long-distance power transmission line, the entire power plant was completed in February of this year, and the power transmission was completed in June. In June, the Chengdu power distribution station was hastily repaired, and power generation officially began last month. The first phase of the thermal power plant was thus completed.</p>
<p>Our reporter visited the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant. The plant site is located in Puchun, Guanxian, covering a considerable area. The current machinery of the power plant includes water supply equipment and coal conveying machines, two boilers and two steam engines, turbo generators, condensers and cooling towers, and a repair shop is attached. The current total power generation is 2,000 kilowatts, of which 100 kilowatts are supplied to the plant itself, the Air Force Youth School, and the coal mine, 200 kilowatts are supplied to Guanxian, and the remaining 1,500 kilowatts are all transmitted to Chengdu. Recently, the Resources Commission has allocated another 5,000-kilowatt generator, which has already arrived in Chongqing. If there are no transportation problems, it can be installed and completed within the year.</p>
<p>Electrifying Western Sichuan · Future Engineering Focus · Completing Hydropower Plans</p>
<p>As for the current focus of work, the focus is on carrying out drilling work for the hydropower plant. To date, over a year has passed, and more than 130 holes have been drilled in the Xuankou area. The success of the thermal power plant has greatly helped drilling and various construction projects. In the future, the focus will be on the phased construction of the hydropower plant: The first phase is to complete the drilling, the second phase is to build the plant site, the third phase is to install the machinery and complete the dam project, and the last is to construct the western Sichuan power transmission network. The future plan is to take Guanxian (Dujiang Power Plant) as the center, with a radius of 250 kilometers as the radiation route, including Jiange in the north, Maogong in the west, Ya'an in the south, and Ziyang in the east, all within this "Western Sichuan Power Grid". This is the most essential area of the "Land of Abundance". The light and heavy industries planned in this power area include: textile manufacturing, sugar refining, coal mining, chemical fertilizers, papermaking, cement, steel, cotton spinning, wool, etc., which will be combined with the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to create a bright and boundless construction prospect for Sichuan.</p>
<p>After spending half a day visiting and interviewing at the Dujiang Power Plant, I only saw the surface of the thermal power plant and the plan of the hydropower plant, as well as the tense work spirit of the engineering staff. However, from here I saw the success of the Dujiang Power Plant and the bright future of Sichuan's construction.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fuqun Company</h3>
<p>Regular Shareholders' Meeting to be Held</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 22nd] The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fuqun Industrial Company was founded in the first year of the Republic by more than one hundred ambitious overseas Chinese from the Americas and Hong Kong, including Li Qi, Li Yutang, Li Qian, Feng Ziyou, and Li Haiyun. It purchased tens of thousands of mu of wasteland in Xiaohongshan, Anhui, and more than 1,300 mu of land in Lianzhuzhou, Dashengguan, Nanjing. In the second year of the Republic, the manager, Li Qi, developed the wasteland along the river in Nanjing into a farm, purchasing many kinds of new European and American agricultural implements, on a grand scale. Unfortunately, in the autumn and winter of the second year of the Republic, Feng Guozhang accused it of being a pro-Yuan Shikai party, saying it was related to Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing, and arrested the manager Li Qi and imprisoned him. Fortunately, the Cantonese merchants in Shanghai jointly bailed him out, and he was released without incident. In order to avoid the ravages of the warlords, the company leased the entire farm to the Agricultural College of Southeast University for management. In the fourth year of the Republic, Li Qi was ordered by Zhu Zhixin to launch an anti-Yuan army in Liangyang and other places in southern Guangdong, but he failed and was martyred. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, the chairman of the company, Li Yutang, passed away. The company then entrusted shareholder Feng Ziyou as the agent in Beijing and Shanghai, leasing the farm to the Agricultural College of Central University as an agricultural trial farm. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing, and the farm was taken over by the puppet government. In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic, Nanjing was restored, and the company recovered the farm, leasing it to shareholder Li Yinhong, who lived in the Overseas Chinese New Village in Banqiao Town, for cultivation. Now, the company's board of directors believes that many shareholders in various places have passed away over the past thirty years, and times have changed. It is also necessary to re-register and expand the company. It is specifically scheduled to convene a shareholders' meeting in Hong Kong on the 28th of this month to discuss all matters.</p>

<h3>The Eve of the Communist Occupation of Kaifeng, A Bloody Episode, Burying Drug Offenders, Swallowing Gold, County Magistrate Wang Jieyi Accused</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] After the communist occupation of Kaifeng was reversed, a confusing case of buried bodies occurred in the county government. The county council believes that County Magistrate Wang Jieyi shot and killed drug offenders and swallowed gold when the communists occupied Kaifeng. However, although County Magistrate Wang strongly denied it in a letter, the county council has formally transferred the case to the court for investigation according to law. The Kaifeng District Prosecutor's Office sent prosecutor Yue Bangjie a few days ago to inspect the bodies at the county government with Speaker Li Fansheng and more than 20 councilors, and took a statement from Wang Jieyi. Subsequently, Speaker Li stated the location where the bodies were buried, and many bodies were exhumed. The county council stated: "When the communists occupied Kaifeng on May 19, County Magistrate Wang privately killed nine people, including drug offenders Niu and Zhang, with the police bureau, swallowed more than 40 taels of gold from them, and buried the bodies in the county government. The council once questioned Wang Jieyi, but Wang firmly denied it. Later, Speaker Li and others personally went to investigate and found bloodstained clothes, human bones, and other items on the ground, and a foul smell permeated the air, proving that there were indeed dead bodies buried there. Wang was speechless at the time. Later, on the evening of the 14th, he wrote a reply to the council, stating that the county government had not made any emergency arrangements to shoot anyone before the communists occupied Kaifeng. During the communist occupation, communist troops resided in the government, and our aircraft bombed the government. The government had no way of knowing who buried the bodies and how many there were. Furthermore, three boxes of medicines from the health center were secretly buried in the open space in the west courtyard before the communist occupation. When the hospital went to get the medicines after the communist occupation, it was found that there were corpses buried on top of the boxes. If it was the county government that shot and killed the criminals, it would not have buried them on top of the medicine boxes." The case is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<h3>Guan Jiyu Talks About Food</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 23rd] In the early autumn when the new grain is on the market and the gold yuan is born, in order to know more about the news of Jiangsu's grain requisition, purchase, and borrowing, I interviewed Minister of Food Guan Jiyu and listened to his remarks on the food issue that everyone cares about. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the reporter asked him the first question: According to the reports from various provinces, what is the preliminary estimate of this year's national autumn harvest? He frankly said: This year, the regions with the most grain production, such as Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi, have reduced their harvests due to floods. However, on a comprehensive estimate, the harvests are mixed. The problem cannot be said to be too serious. If the foreign grain purchased and transported this year arrives on schedule and in sufficient quantities, and the adjustment and allocation work is actively carried out in various places in the future, it is expected that both military supplies and people's food can be properly resolved. Because the importance of military grain is known to everyone, and the severity of the people's food problem caused by the war has made people across the country deeply understand: In order to implement national policies, the Ministry of Food must implement this emergency food policy every year during wartime, such as requisitioning, purchasing, and borrowing. There is no other choice but to earnestly follow and assist. Now the suppression war has entered a decisive stage. Once the autumn is high and the horses are fat, the national army will be able to achieve a decisive victory on all fronts. However, to make the soldiers full and the strong men in the rear full, the government must successfully promote the policy of "sufficient food" and "sufficient troops." I remember that during the First World War, Hoover, who was in charge of American food policy, once said: "The final victory of the war depends on the people's food." At that time, Moltke, the chief of the German General Staff, also said: "To destroy Germany without fighting, unless you destroy German agriculture and block German food." Later, Moltke's words unfortunately came true. The importance of wartime food policy is the same in China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>Speaking of the food growth and decline and surpluses and deficits of various provinces in China, Minister Guan said: In his book "The Food Problem in China," published in May of this year, it is explained that my country's grain production last year, including rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, was: 137,068,000 tons, but the national annual consumption of grain was 141,034,000 tons, with a deficit of 3,966,000 tons. Last year, the surplus grain areas in China included the nine northeastern provinces, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Taiwan, as well as Xiang, E, Gan, Wan, Cha, Qing, Ning, Re, Dian, and other 31 provinces. The grain deficit areas included Yue, Gui, Yu, Ji, Qian, Min, Zhe, Shan, Sui, Xin, Gan, Kang, as well as Ping, Jin, Jing, Hu, Yu, Shen, Han, Qing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and other 24 provinces and cities. As a result of supplementing the deficit with the surplus and adjusting the surpluses to help the deficits, the grain shortage can only be made up by foreign grain. It was estimated in mid-May of this year that my country may import about 800,000 tons of foreign grain this year. If the national output this year is not lower than last year, what's more, the situation this year is obviously very different from last year, and the severity of the grain shortage problem can be imagined. Fortunately, in the future, the import of foreign grain will increase day by day. However, the fundamental way to solve the food shortage is to actively carry out production increase work, and the passive method should be to save food as much as possible. In addition, talking about the issue of food allocation in Jiangsu this year, he said that this is the most important work, which has been actively carried out by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Farmland and Grain Office. The Ministry of Food will do its best to assist and supervise it, because the stability of grain prices in various parts of Jiangsu often has a cause-and-effect relationship with Beijing and Shanghai, especially today after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked about the price of grain after the new grain came on the market. When the reporter mentioned that the price of new grain in some areas was obviously catching up with the old grain, he seemed to sigh and say: The situation this year is different from previous years, but the hoarding wind can be expected to gradually decrease and even disappear under the strict laws and regulations of strengthened control.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Economic Supervision Committee Decides to Restrict the Transportation of Cotton Cloth to the South, and Temporarily Mark Cooking Oil Raw Materials for Export for Three Months</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At 10 a.m. yesterday, Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo convened an emergency meeting in the president's office of the National Bank to discuss the issue of stabilizing the prices of several necessities in the city. More than ten people, including Chen Liang, Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, Yang Chuo'an, Zhang Yujiu, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, and Chen Shuhui, attended and passed several important cases. Among them, regarding the cooking oil part, it was decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan to issue an order prohibiting the export of rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, and their raw materials, with a temporary period of three months. For cooking oil rotation, it is necessary to consider the actual needs of various cities in South China and limit it. If there is a surplus of cooking oil and its raw materials, the China Trust Bureau or other institutions will be entrusted to purchase it.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: At 4 p.m. yesterday, Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo convened another meeting to discuss the issue of cotton cloth. Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, Dong Yunzhang, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, and Liu Jianqun attended. The following cases were decided: (1) Submit a request to the Executive Yuan to restrict the transportation of cotton cloth to the south, and authorize the Economic Control Supervisor of the Shanghai District to negotiate and implement the measures. (2) The Construction Bank and the Central Bank will sell off within the price limit of August 19th from today (26th) according to the listing method. (3) Designate a special person to negotiate on US aid cotton to ensure that it is promptly allocated to various yarn factories. In addition, several other important cases were passed.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Regarding the approved sales price of Taiwan sugar, the original selling price per city picul on the 19th of this month was equivalent to 30 gold yuan, 1 jiao and 7 fen. Yesterday's approved sales price was 27 yuan, 1 jiao and 1 gold yuan per city picul. After Liu Gongyun negotiated with Taiwan Sugar Company, it was decided that the approved sales price in the future should be below the "819" price limit.</p>
<h3>Credit is Loose and Abundant, People's Hearts are Firm, Cotton Yarn Market Rises to the Limit, Cotton Cloth is Stable and Turning Upbeat as Harvest Approaches</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was quite firm due to the trend of loose credit in the industry. However, the morale in the market was idle. In order to comply with the economic control measures, the association authorities informed the industry at around 11 a.m. that all transactions in the market must be converted and traded according to the market price on the 19th, and the gold yuan price converted from the market price on the 19th was announced. However, the shouting prices mostly rose to the limit (the cotton yarn market price in this newspaper's market price list is published according to the association's market price), but both buyers and sellers held a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, only four transaction orders were made in the morning, with a total of 14 transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the cotton cloth market opened in the morning, the chairman of the association came to the market to state the intentions of the authorities, saying that it must not exceed the price limit to avoid being punished. The legal profit will naturally be required to be guaranteed, and the Fangjian Company is requested to fully allocate Longxian fine cloth and Sijunzi yuan serge to meet market sales. At this time, a large number of economic police personnel arrived, heavily guarded, and monitored the transactions.</p>
<p>When the twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth opened for trading, the shouting price fell by 1 yuan and 3 jiao. There were rumors that cotton yarn was prohibited from being exported, and the next day, more Longxian cloth came out, and the market was hovering around a corner. Later, because the Hankou gang made some progress and the market credit was loose, the market also turned upbeat, and it returned to 29 yuan and 2 jiao. The Five Blessings trumpet cloth fell by 1 to 5 jiao, and the Sijunzi yuan serge trade was more active, returning to 5 jiao (still 2 jiao short of the 19th). The local white grey cloth and colored cloth and other government cloths mostly showed a flat and tired state, with a total turnover of 1,440 bolts.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: In the afternoon, the authorities sent economic police personnel to strictly patrol the transactions outside the market, and merchants rarely dared to take the risk, so there was no news of trading.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: According to industry insiders, the main reason for the recent market firmness is that Fangjian Company has not opened sales of high-end goods for several periods, and the market turnover is lacking. At the same time, credit is extremely loose, and external floating capital has infiltrated activities, causing people's hearts to be optimistic and the number of buyers to increase. The industry has turned upbeat, and the rising trend has started. How the future changes will depend on whether Fangjian Company supplies as much as possible, which is the main key to the market price fluctuations.</p>
<h3>China Textile National Bank Sells Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The China Textile Retail Department sold 652 pieces of yarn yesterday, equivalent to 1253 and a half pieces of 20 counts, totaling 530,336 gold yuan. It also sold 481 pieces on behalf of the Central Bank, with an amount of 313,490 gold yuan.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Agricultural, Forestry, Industrial, and Commercial Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee held its 51st committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 24th) in the conference room of the Chinese Farmers Bank on the Bund. More than ten committee members were present, including Chen Ai-shi, Ge Jing-zhong, Wang Bo-tian, He Mo-lin, and Diao Min-ren. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Tan Xi-hong, the chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>(A) Report Items: (1) Reading of the minutes of the previous meeting; (2) Letter from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stating that raw silk inspection is entering the peak season, requesting that factories be notified to report no more than the limited amount of raw silk for inspection each day.

Proposal for discussion. Resolution passed; (2) Letter from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stating that the bundling materials used for raw silk inspection should be purchased by the applicant in the future.

Resolution: Please have China Morning Post, the Central Trust Bureau, and this committee jointly send personnel to recalculate and quickly request the loan team of the Four Joint Offices to verify and transfer to the Central Farmers Bank for lending.</p>
<h3>Excess Funds from Banks and Bureaus Concentrated in Central Bank</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Secretariat of the Four Joint Offices recently informed the Central Bank that excess funds from national banks and bureaus should be concentrated in the Central Bank in accordance with regulations. As for the transfer of funds for joint loans by various branches, it can be done by application or by issuing Central Bank checks as originally scheduled. The Central Bank has already notified its branches accordingly.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales and Meager Transactions; Rice Market Trends Weaken Again; Flour Slightly Increases, Edible Oil Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>The rice market initially rose and then weakened, attempting to increase power but instead seeing a price drop. When the market opened, cargo owners felt that the rice price had been too low the previous day, so they tried to raise it, initially shouting for a five-cent increase. However, due to sluggish sales and meager transactions, the price quickly returned to the original level. Later, due to abundant supply and weak demand, there was a slight decline. At the Nanshi market, both white glutinous rice and early rice fell by five cents, Xian rice also dropped by five cents, while thin rice and new glutinous rice remained at the original price. The Beishi market was relatively stable, with medium-grade early thin rice reduced by thirty-five cents, while the rest remained flat. New Yang Xian rice debuted at 18.5 yuan, with 4,067 piculs arriving yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour slightly increased because factories had not been releasing goods for several days. The market was short of goods, especially old brands such as Lao Che, which were scarce and expensive. Miscellaneous brands were more stable. Bingshen flour opened at seven yuan and later rose to 7.15 yuan. Lao Che was at 7.35 yuan. Jiancheng and Hongfeng each opened at 7.13 yuan, an increase of 1.5 to 2 cents. Miscellaneous brands Changcheng and Fenghuang slightly increased, while the rest remained stable. Bran slightly fell by five cents, wheat factory price at 7.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains were firm and stable. In order to encourage the industry not to exceed the limit price, the market announced the standard price on August 19th yesterday, and most transactions were opened at the limit price. Hankou Zhazadou was 10.033 yuan, Meiqing and Dongdou were opened at the limit price, corn and Yuanmai sales were still good in the northern gang, plus five cents, new corn was 12.5 yuan, tea beans were stable, broad beans had no changes, sesame was stable, raw kernels had transactions at the limit price, but there were not many sellers.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices hovered at the limit price. The price of raw oil was three yuan away from the limit price the previous day, but it jumped to the limit price of 64 yuan (per barrel) yesterday, an increase of three yuan. The factory and recycling of soybean oil released goods, and the price was five cents lower than the closing price of the previous day. The soybean oil of each factory was mostly 51.5 yuan, and raw rapeseed oil was 46.5 yuan. The market said it was stable. Small cart sesame oil opened at the original price, bean cake slightly increased by one or two cents, but there were not many transactions.</p>
<h3>Money Market Increasingly Loose; Banks and Bureaus Overdraw Again</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the issuance of gold yuan, and the money market was increasingly loose. The underground interest rate fell steadily, reaching a minimum of 0.15 yuan, which was in line with the bank's lending interest rate. The average interbank lending rate was 0.2 yuan. National banks and bureaus overdrew another 50,000 yuan, of which the Central Bank issued 1.61 million yuan, the large exchange entered 840,000 yuan, foreign merchants issued 520,000 yuan, the small exchange issued 270,000 yuan, China entered 220,000 yuan, Transportation entered 820,000 yuan, China Agricultural entered 20,000 yuan, China Trust entered 130,000 yuan, Postal Remittance entered 200,000 yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury entered 80,000 yuan. The exchange exchanged 201,133 instruments, with a total exchange amount of 59,869,162.24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nationwide Cotton Production Estimate; Jiangsu Has the Highest Output</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The National Textile Federation and the Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry jointly released the first national cotton production estimate report for this year. This estimate is based on the survey estimates from seventeen provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Liaoning, Longxi, Yunnan, Taiwan, and Ningxia, using the situation at the end of July this year as the standard.</p>
<p>This year, the cotton fields in these seventeen provinces totaled 3,756,400 Chinese acres, with a production of 1,133,200 piculs, compared to the final estimate of 3,886,100 Chinese acres and a production of 1,102,300 piculs last year. The cotton fields decreased by 129,700 Chinese acres, but the production still increased by 30,900 piculs, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Among the seventeen provinces, Jiangsu Province has the highest output, with a total of 2,286,000 piculs, an increase of 98,000 piculs compared to last year. If the public security in northern Jiangsu were not affected, the output would have been even higher. The second is Hubei with 1,866,000 piculs, and the third is Shandong with 1,610,000 piculs. However, due to public security reasons in Hubei, this year's output has decreased sharply (according to last year's output of 6,241,000 piculs). Other provinces such as Shaanxi and Zhejiang have also achieved good results in increasing production, with Shaanxi at 1,115,000 piculs and Zhejiang at 495,000 piculs.</p>
<p>The provinces with the largest production reductions are Henan, Hunan, and Liaoning, either due to war or floods, all of which have decreased sharply. Henan is estimated at 934,000 piculs, Hunan at 220,000 piculs, and Liaoning at only 10,000 piculs.</p>
<h3>Designated Banking Association Holds Meeting to Discuss Foreign Exchange Transactions</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Designated Banking Association of this city held a temporary general membership meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday to discuss foreign exchange transactions after the currency reform. The result was a resolution:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the question of how to unify the foreign exchange quotations reported by various banks, it was resolved that, in principle, the buying and selling prices should still be calculated by deducting the 1.25% handling fee, and the remainder should be determined at their discretion.</p>
<p>(2) The previous request to the Central Bank to recall the foreign exchange settlement certificates was not intended by the national banks. It was resolved to continue to buy and sell them in the market, and the importers and exporters would automatically balance the chips.</p>
<p>(3) The national banks gave an interest rate of 0.18 yuan for all forward foreign exchange held by exporters, which seemed too low. However, since the national banks have approved exporters' forward foreign exchange positions that have not yet expired to be sold back to the national banks early, the interest rate issue is no longer very important.</p>
<h3>Various Major Exports Implement Price Limits</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In order to increase exports, the Export Control Committee has implemented price limits for major exports starting from the 24th of this month. The price of tung oil is set at 0.2 US dollars per pound, and the price of pig bristles (Tianjin No. 55 long) is 9.1 US dollars per pound. A contract has been signed with the British Food Department for ice eggs, with a delivery price of 204 pounds and 5 shillings per picul in Shanghai. The most common quality straw hats are priced at 5 US dollars per dozen. The price of tea is still being drafted. As for the price of raw silk, the domestic price is 2.9 US dollars per pound for D-grade raw silk, while the US market price is above 3 US dollars. The international market price is already higher than the domestic price, so price limits are no longer needed.</p>
<h3>Export Merchants Hope for Improvement</h3>
<p>The Import and Export Management Committee has implemented price limits on exports in line with the Economic Emergency Disposal Order, which has aroused strong resentment among export merchants. According to the person in charge of the export industry yesterday, this year's export business has been unable to prosper before the currency reform. This is because the domestic export commodity prices are too high, and there is no profit to be made when shipping them abroad. After the currency reform, domestic prices can be more stable, and the export sector is planning to strengthen exports to seize the foreign market and lay the foundation for the foreign market. The Import and Export Management Committee's implementation of the price limit system is tantamount to preventing the development of the export business. The yarn and cloth market in various parts of Nanyang is currently being dumped by Japanese goods at depreciated prices. Our country should also depreciate and sell them to seize the market position. In Africa, tea and other goods can also be transported and sold to seize the previous market. If restrictions are imposed, so that export goods cannot be exported at lower prices, it will be a great obstacle to the export sector. It is hoped that the Import and Export Management Committee can have supplementary measures to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Another news item: The Import and Export Management Committee, in accordance with Article 9 of the government's announcement on the management of finances and strengthening economic controls regarding import and export management measures, stipulates that the import quota should be reduced by one-quarter from the seventh quarter, and for goods imported outside the quota, a number of goods are designated to allow merchants to apply for export. However, this provision is only in principle and there are no specific measures. In order to prevent the cessation of import and export work, the committee dispatched its deputy director Deng Youjin to Nanjing last night to ask the Executive Yuan for instructions, and then discuss the specific implementation rules.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Internal Exchange Rates by Banks and Bureaus</h3>
<p>The internal exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be revised as follows from the 26th: Xiamen 20 yuan, Fuzhou 50 yuan, Quanzhou 40 yuan, Guangzhou, Shantou, Zhanjiang, Haikou 40 yuan each, Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Nanning 25 yuan each. Changsha, Hengyang, Yuanling 50 yuan each.</p>
<p>Towns along the Beijing-Shanghai line 8 yuan each, Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian 95 yuan each, Wuhan 50 yuan each, Shashi, Yichang 95 yuan each, Pingjin 10 yuan each, Qingdao 10 yuan, Jingdezhen, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Jian, Ganzhou 95 yuan each.</p>
<p>Hangzhou 8 yuan, Jiaxing 10 yuan, Wenzhou 95 yuan, Ningbo 10 yuan, Shaoxing, Huzhou 15 yuan each, Hefei, Anqing 50 yuan each, Tunxi 60 yuan, Wuhu 50 yuan, Bengbu 40 yuan, Shexian 60 yuan, Henan area 90 yuan, Guizhou 95 yuan, Yunnan 95 yuan, Shaanxi, Gansu 20 yuan each, Ningqing. Xikang, Suiyuan, Xinjiang 30 yuan each, other places unchanged.</p>
<h3>Increased Taxes on Cigarettes, Foreign Liquor, etc.</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Jianghai Customs issued a bulletin yesterday, roughly stating that they had received a government order to increase the tax rate on cigarettes and foreign liquor and beer to 120%, and the tax rate on beverages to 30%. They were ordered to comply. Therefore, in addition to complying and implementing it from August 23rd of this year, this announcement is hereby issued for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Board of Directors of the Banking Association Discusses the Capital Issue of Banks</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Banking Association of this city convened a joint meeting of the Board of Directors yesterday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM. Representatives from the money industry and trust industry participated, with a total of more than 30 people present. Li Ming, Chairman of the Banking Association, presided over the meeting. The meeting discussed in detail the adjustment of the capital of the financial industry.</p>
<p>During the meeting, everyone believed that the minimum capital amount for banks currently set by the government was too high, and the banks felt that they could not afford it. Furthermore, the plan formulated by the Banking Association was not discussed because the principle of capital amount could not be resolved. Until about 6 o'clock, there was still no concrete resolution. Finally, it was decided to wait quietly for the government authorities to announce the implementation of the capital adjustment method and how the capital of national banks and bureaus would be adjusted for reference, and then make a decision.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Sun Chu-ren, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, made a statement on behalf of the association, stating that based on statistical figures and reasoning, the total deposits of banks in Shanghai in 1937 were approximately 4 billion yuan, and the total issuance was approximately 1.4 billion yuan. At that time, the total capital of banks in Shanghai was approximately 400 million yuan, which was approximately one-tenth of the total deposits and a little more than one-third of the total issuance.</p>
<p>If the trust companies and banks in Shanghai are now required to increase their capital to 1 million gold yuan, and the money shops are required to increase their capital to 500,000 gold yuan, with 105 banks (excluding national banks, provincial and municipal banks, and foreign banks) having a capital of 1 million gold yuan each, and 90 money shops and trust companies having a capital of 500,000 yuan each, the total capital would increase to 150 million gold yuan, equivalent to 450 trillion legal tender yuan, which is approximately three-quarters of the current total national issuance. If the capital of national banks and bureaus is added, it can almost reach the entire amount of issuance. Compared with the current total deposits, the deposits of Shanghai commercial banks and trust companies in June totaled 13 trillion legal tender yuan, equivalent to 4.53 million gold yuan. In the past, capital was one-tenth of the amount of deposits, but today capital is 30 times the amount of deposits. Nothing could be more reversed.</p>
<p>He further stated that the capital of each bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, but is not recognized due to the currency reform, which is unreasonable.</p>

<h3>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Assembly Approves Holding a Research Conference in the Far East; Guo Youshou Reports to Reporters at the Ministry of Education Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 25th] UNESCO is composed of 44 countries with a staff of 600 people. There are ten countries from the Far East Asia participating, but there are too few staff, which inevitably leads to separation. Therefore, the organization specially raised the salary of Educational Inspector Guo Youshou and reassigned him as an education consultant, using this to contact and liaise with various countries in the Far East Asia to find professional talents to join UNESCO's work. Mr. Guo departed from Paris in early June, and traveled through eight countries including Ceylon, Dutch East Indies, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Philippines, India, Burma, and Siam, arriving back in our capital on the 24th. At 5 pm on the 25th, he met with reporters at the Ministry of Education to report on the participation of various countries in UNESCO, and shared his impressions. He noted that Afghanistan provides preferential treatment to students from elementary school to university, and education is developed. Education in India is also making great strides, and women are enthusiastic about participating in politics. He also said that UNESCO has held academic research conferences, all of which were in Western countries. He proposed to hold a research conference in the Far East, which has been approved by the General Assembly, to be held in China and India in the Far East. Mr. Guo was in India, and the Indian authorities advocated holding it in India. After Mr. Guo returned to China, our government also wished to hold it in our country, and planned to ask Dr. Hu Shi to accept the preparations, and entrusted Mr. Guo to go to Peiping to discuss matters. But the final decision must be made by UNESCO. UNESCO can subsidize 30,000 US dollars for this research conference for the purpose of hiring teachers. It is also scheduled to host a cultural event on the 27th, and then go to Peiping and various parts of Japan on the 28th before returning to Paris.</p>

<h3>Increased Research Funding for Professors; Paid in Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 25th] Since the currency reform, the salaries of public education personnel have been paid in gold yuan according to the new system. Regarding the academic research subsidies for professors in specialized schools and above, the Ministry of Education recently requested the Executive Yuan to increase them quickly to subsidize the lives of professors, and set them in gold yuan units of 20 yuan, 15 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan, to be issued to professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, respectively, starting in August. Converted at this rate, it is much higher than before.</p>

<h3>Chinese Students in the United States Debate the Pros and Cons of Studying in Big Cities</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 25th] Four Chinese students discussed the pros and cons of studying in large US cities in the Chinese student forum program on the "Voice of America" radio station last night. Those who supported studying in large cities such as New York and Chicago believed that schools in large cities have better facilities, more libraries to use, teachers are generally better than those in universities in smaller cities, and social life is richer. Those who supported studying in small cities believed that large cities are noisy and easily distracting, entertainment and social activities hinder research work, teachers in universities in large cities are not necessarily better than those in small cities, and pointed out that famous universities such as Yale University and the University of California are not in large cities.</p>
<h3>The National Resources Commission (NRC) Employs University Students; 270 This Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The National Resources Commission (NRC) employs a large number of new university graduates each year. In total, it has recruited approximately 270 new graduates from 30 universities including National Central University this year. The scope of employment includes 24 departments such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, mining and metallurgy, and management. The NRC pays special attention to Taiwan Province. The number of graduates employed from Taiwan University this time accounts for almost one-eighth of the total number of graduates employed from various universities. It also distributes Taiwan students to work in the mainland as much as possible to enhance their feelings and understanding of the motherland and promote cultural exchange. The NRC's principles for selecting new university graduates are roughly as follows: (1) According to the business needs of each unit, the number of employees needed is determined based on their situation, and universities are requested to recommend twice the number of students. (2) The country is divided into seven regions including Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Tianjin, and each business unit should employ new graduates from universities in the same region as much as possible. (3) The selection criteria are based on the average grades of the recommended students, and interviews are conducted separately to determine the selection. (4) Students who receive scholarships from the NRC have priority in distribution according to their wishes. It is learned that the NRC's employment of new university graduates this year has been approved and will be announced at the end of the month, and the recommended universities and relevant units have been notified that the employed students can complete the registration procedures in early September.</p>

<h3>Meeting of City Middle School Principals Discusses Tuition Fees for the Next Semester; Heated Discussion Without a Decision; Representatives from the Teachers' Union Attend to Advocate for Professional Development Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The principals of municipal secondary schools in this city gathered at Yucaizhongxue on Shankuaiguan Road at 4 pm yesterday to discuss the issue of tuition fees. More than 20 principals from various schools attended, and the meeting was chaired by Zhu Bihui, the principal of the senior nursing school. Director Li of the City Education Bureau also attended. The heated discussion lasted for three and a half hours without a decision. Director Li will submit the standards proposed by each school and the standards of the Education Bureau to Mayor Wu for approval.</p>
<p>Teachers' Professional Development Fees</p>
<p>The most heated discussion during the meeting was whether to continue collecting teachers' professional development fees. Two representatives from the Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Union attended and requested that the collection of teachers' professional development fees be continued, with half of the fees borne by the city government and half by the students' parents, to subsidize the lives of teachers.</p>
<p>Agreed on Tuition Fees</p>
<p>Finally, it was agreed that the tuition fees for junior high school should be 28 gold yuan, and the tuition fees for senior high school should be 32 gold yuan, both including 10 yuan for teachers' professional development fees. The principals believed that the low tuition fees before the war could be maintained because the school's office expenses and temporary expenses were sufficient. Now, the school's office expenses are not enough to pay for water and electricity fees, so they must rely on tuition fees to maintain operations.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Proposes Standards</p>
<p>Director Li proposed that the tuition fee standard for junior high school is 21 gold yuan, and the tuition fee standard for senior high school is 25 gold yuan. Starting this semester, each school should pay attention to promoting sports and strengthening sports activities, so it is specifically stipulated that the sports fee for senior and junior high schools is 2 yuan, and the tuition fee is 1 yuan. The remaining 18 yuan for junior high school and 22 yuan for senior high school are allocated for other expenses. Director Li will report to Mayor Wu for approval.</p>

<p>We have received a letter from Xingzhi Middle School stating: "To the Shen Bao: According to reports in various Shanghai newspapers on August 18th and 19th concerning academic assessments, it was mentioned that 'Yucai Middle School is one of the strongholds of communist activities in Shanghai, and some of this year's graduates have been sent to communist areas.'

<h3>Crickets</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>"Another year passes easily with the autumn wind." Although the line of poetry is cliché, when the season arrives, it will give people endless sighs. These two days, the盂蘭盆會 is being performed in the evening, with 法鼓 and 金鐃, and the金元法幣 is being discussed during the day, in street talks and alley discussions. We sour literati and pedantic scholars, who have always lacked the ability to bear burdens, are the most peaceful and content at this time. We have never wronged anyone in our lives, so we certainly don't need to spend money on repentance. American dollars, gold, and silver do not belong to us, so there is no need for worry or panic. It's cooler in the evening, and the moonlight is just beginning to rise. Listening to the sounds of "唧唧啾啾" from the grass clumps in the corner of the wall, "A single leaf can welcome intention, a tiny insect can draw the heart." This is my world. No wonder since the Three Hundred Poems, the songs of the Han and Wei dynasties, poets have liked to use autumn insects as their rhyme.</p>
<p>The earliest cricket to enter poetry is, of course, the Tang Feng Cricket chapter. Today, when I flipped through Zhu Chuan and reread it, I felt that the people of the north, such as Wei and Tang, have never lived very well. The first four lines of Cricket, "蟋蟀在堂，歲聿其莫，今我不樂，日月其除!" are clearly a complaining tone, very similar in meaning to the closely connected poem "The Mountain has a Pivot, the Marsh has a Elm." Leaving this aside, the cricket entering the hall and the end of the year naturally means that the ancient and modern calendars are different. The 風 in July: "七月在野，八月在宇，九月在戶，十月蟋蟀入我床下," is an even more famous line. Here, it clearly states that the cricket in the hall is in October. Zhou Zhengjianzi, October is the end of the year, which is a very accurate statement. However, I don't know why, in the north today, there are very few who can still hear crickets in the Little Spring of October. Could it be that the ancient and modern climates are different? Banner people often use gourds to raise crickets, which can be used to get through the winter. This is another way to prolong life. Relying on high gates is different in character from self-sheltering with an acorn.</p>
<p>Although Chinese people have had a tradition of happily forgetting about nature since ancient times, which has been praised by foreigners, the secular view is mostly utilitarian. Poets look at "衆鳥欣有託" or "草長鶯飛," while ordinary people must put the birds in cages to play with their chirping feathers, and they can also be sold at a low price. Tiny insects like crickets cannot avoid this. It can only be said that it is because of "蘭膏自煎熬，多才爲患害?" Although crickets chirp clearly in autumn, in fact, no one appreciates this瞿瞿 sound, and they cruelly watch them fight. Prime Minister Banxiantang played with them first, and Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty continued after him. Reading the "Promoting Weaving" article in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio makes people feel indignant. It turns out that in addition to the disasters of the three officials and three farewells in the autocratic era, there was also this abusive government that entertained the eyes and ears! Fortunately, we are exempt from this in the democratic era, which is the happiest thing for us.</p>
<p>Zhuangzi's account of Bian Zhuangzi watching tigers fight is always somewhat immoral. If measured by the words of the old man from Han Yin, this is also one end of the machine heart. The reason why people are different from animals is very small. This is probably one or two of what is hoped for. The so-called "庶民去之君子存之" was originally to raise the value of gentlemen, but in fact, according to my view above, it just explains that gentlemen are not able to become things. Mencius's words are not very different from Confucius's. Confucius would say honest words like "Advanced in ritual and music, barbarians also," but Mencius insisted on saying this kind of delusional talk that did not conform to the facts. Later generations, such as Han Tuizhi, were all annoying ghosts with this kind of delusional slogan. I'm straying too far from the topic. Now we're still back to crickets. What I want to say is nothing more than the feeling of watching two little insects fighting hard. Even the dead ones are scolded as "廢料, 不行!" and the winners are appreciated for their "翹然長鳴." I really don't know what kind of mentality this is! Gu Tieqing's "French Records" records that Wu men fighting crickets is even more terrible:</p>
<p>"Around the White Dew Festival, crickets are tamed and raised for the pleasure of gambling fights, which is called autumn interest, commonly known as fighting humility. Carrying cages to look at each other, forming teams and groups, calling their insects generals, with big heads and long feet being valuable, and blue, yellow, red, black and white primary colors being superior. The sizes are similar, and the weights are exactly the same. Then the gate is opened. Sometimes there are those who hold grass to attract enemies, which is called enemy grass. The two sides recognize the color, either red or green, which is called marking the head. The audience below the stage uses the victory or defeat on the stage as the basis for winning or losing, which is called sticking to the door. Dividing the chips is called flowers. Flowers are false names, with one hundred and twenty copper coins as one flower, from one flower to hundreds or thousands of flowers, depending on the agreement between the two families. The winner gets the prize, and the loser loses money, without any cost of words."</p>
<p>Look at this scene, how does it compare to watching horse racing at the racecourse or watching dog racing at Yiyuan?</p>
<p>Autumn evenings are originally extremely quiet, but the children next door, holding 洋燈盆水, immediately run over to pour it wherever they hear a cry, and they won't stop until they get the insects out. By the next morning, most of them have died in battle or been trampled and discarded, so they catch new ones again. If insects have knowledge, what would they say?</p>
<h3>Record of Dalongqiu</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>The autumn heat is still fierce, and the evening lamp breeds sweat. In my dreams on the pillow, I often fall between the mountains and rivers of Yongjia. I remember that I traveled extensively in the old Yandang, taking the road through Shanshan Pond in Wenling. The蒲帆 sailed the sea for thirty miles, reaching Baixi Town. Then, I followed 谢公, stopping at the Longqiu Pavilion. It was after the rain, and reading Kang Nanhai's "There is water from heaven" sentence often described the reality. I also once wrote a long song, regretting that there was no way to exhaust its magnificence.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the sixth month, I made a trip to Yandang. The God of Heaven first rained for three days, preparing for me to accumulate momentum and strengthen the Longqiu. I set off from Shashan Ferry in the morning, drank at the Baixi Tower at noon, and listened to the "Vimalakirti Sutra" bell at night. The rustling of pine wishes has not yet stopped. I rushed out in草鞋. The sparrows were startled and chirped, blaming me for not being strong enough to kill the thieves, and for making hard山水 a warning. Crossing the Saddle Ridge, the stream was steep稠. The thin ones split their toes, and the high ones refused to stab my eyes. The firm thunder overturned under my crotch with sand, and I went straight in without looking back. For ten years, I have vowed to seek seclusion here. Water, water, I have already seen it flowing on the horizon: quite like white cloth thrown from above, who is pulling it is difficult to find? The sound is vast and the wind is whistling. The sixth month in front of me turns into a cool autumn, more than three feet wide and unable to be rolled up. It is thrown into the bottom of the pool and then drawn upside down, and snowflakes splash on the trees, all foam. I think the stone gate is tricky without being straight and forceful, and what I saw in Lushan cannot be so magnificent and repaired. Suddenly there is sadness, and the sky is also worried, should water be a plan for the ears and eyes, and wash away the shame of Qianbei for all ages! Can the Taoist priest in the tower understand? At dusk, the peak turned into a red skull.</p>
<h3>Thirteen Affairs of Yuan Hanyun</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Hanyun, among the sons of Xiangcheng, is known for his才不. His affairs are spread and can be used as a talk after wine and tea. Mr. Yuan ranked second, named Ke Wen, and his style name was Bao Cen (according to one saying, when he was born, Xiangcheng dreamed of a foreigner carrying a small golden leopard to see him, so based on the meaning of the Book of Changes, he was given the name). His other style name was Baocun, and his nickname was Hanyun. His birth mother was from Korea, and his bloodline was transmitted, so his skin was especially fair. As a child, he was clever and had the reputation of a child prodigy. He first studied under Fang Dishan, and his poems and ancient springs inherited the new tradition. Later, he appraised ancient artifacts from Xuan Guyu; he examined the version from Li Shengduo. Throughout his life, he was respectful of the three sons. First of all, when Xiangcheng was in power, he lived in the Liushuiyin in the former palace, and the guests were often full, and the famous people gathered together. In addition to his best friend Bu Linwu, the poets Yi Shifu and Luo Yinggong (Yi Luo's anecdotes are many, which will be recorded in another article) and others came every day, lingering in literature and wine, no different from immortals.</p>
<p>Hanyun was both excellent and talented. He did not fail to participate in calligraphy, prose, and textual research. However, the art of calligraphy was especially outstanding and famous in the world. He practiced Liu in his early years, and in his later years, he participated in Dengshan's brushwork. His brushwork was thin, hard, round, and strong. As a result, he changed his posture and established his own style. When he was writing small characters, he often leaned back to write. When writing couplets, he suspended his wrist in the air, so that he could write large and small characters at will, without any regrets. After Bingyin, he changed his signature to Hanyun, written in seal script and cursive script, and the signature was like forty-two. Because his concubine's name was Wenxue, he also created a seal, with the inscription Hanyun Wenxue.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan was also skilled in poetry and lyrics, such as the Lyrics to the Tune Remembering Little Peach Red for Lin Baishui, or the lyrics mourning the old events of Hongxian, or lamenting the restoration of the chaos. The sound outside the strings makes people fascinated when reading it. In Bingyin, Kuang Huifeng died on the sea, and he wrote a mourning couplet: "Compared to Mengchuang Baishi, the old inn became a home, with low singing and light drinking, a generation of lyricists will last forever. Tracing back to Ou Yin's Canlu, we talked about hard work together, sad and small building Qingye, how many times have we met in Jiang country in ten years." The sorrow for the virtuous is unbearable.</p>
<p>Hanyun tried to expand his collection of Song and Yuan good books, which were countless. The most precious ones, about 200 kinds, were especially painted in the study with the inscription "One Collection of Two Hundred Song Books Every Day." The collection of Liu Hedong's Fish Mysterious Machines was even more extensive. Therefore, his collection of books was famous all over the world. Any Song or Yuan edition, once inscribed, can be sold at a good price. Those who know the goods allowed the solitary copy in the sea, and almost included it, only one person after Huang Xiaopu. The rest of the collection includes postal stamps, gold pounds, small bronze wares, ancient coins, seals, and fan bones. When appreciating and appraising them, he often拓朱钤 and attached them to his diary. His interests and hobbies were not constant. He would take and abandon things at will. For example, when he became interested in collecting stamps, he would spend a lot of money to buy them. One day, he would easily become fond of ancient coins, and then sell his old collection and abandon it like worn shoes. In addition to ancient books, he never possessed two things at the same time for a long time, and things were never favored for many years. Only the half-wall book city remained forever.</p>
<p>It was the same with people. He easily changed his concubines, all of whom were produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, such as Qiongji, Fengzhu, Xiaoyingying, and Peiwen. Looking at the words of Huanxisha and Butterfly Love Flowers, the style is romantic, just like Zhang Xu back then. He was sincerely faithful to the divine path, and went to the Jigong altar to fortune his life, and obtained twelve poems, each of which must have hidden the name of each concubine, and later it was effective (only to the ninth concubine, he suddenly thanked the world). Every New Year's Day, he must kowtow to the statue of Jigong. According to himself, the reason why he played the world and did not respect it was that he had unspeakable pain, that is, he called himself the second son of the emperor, and his participation in Anqing was also based on his helpless inner thoughts. The way to protect himself was probably in this.</p>
<p>When Xiangcheng passed away, thirty-three members of the family (including seventeen brothers and sixteen sisters) divided the inheritance equally, each receiving 90,000 in cash and 140,000 in real estate. At that time, Han初 received the property, came to Shanghai to live in Hongkou, and then moved to Baker Road (now next to the Sino-American Hospital) and Avenue Joffre. After two years of spending extravagantly, he finally became financially strapped and heavily indebted. He relied on mortgaging antiques until his death. Jin Lin</p>
<h3>Freedom</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>Without freedom, the country cannot survive; without virtue, freedom cannot survive. - Rousseau</p>
<p>Freedom and unity can never be separated. - Webster</p>
<p>When freedom reaches its peak, human life is at its most fulfilling. - Dante</p>
<p>True freedom lies in the right to enjoy one's own rights, not in destroying the rights of others. - Binka</p>
<h3>A Good Official is Hard to Be</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhou</p>
<p>A good official is hard to be, at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Former US Secretary of the Interior Ickes was fair and honest and was one of President Roosevelt's most admired "talents," but because he was iron-faced, selfless, and didn't show favoritism, he offended countless colleagues.</p>
<p>During World War II, because he felt that government departments were wasting too much paper on "official correspondence," he started with the Interior Department, which he was in charge of, and forbade his subordinates to waste paper. Unexpectedly, these subordinates had a considerable bureaucratic atmosphere. They were used to Ickes' anger on weekdays, so they took the opportunity to retaliate. They printed thousands of copies of any of Ickes' orders regarding saving paper, distributed them to forty-eight states, and then forwarded them to various counties and towns, which used up an unknown amount of paper. Furthermore, they printed countless documents and countless forms, requiring local agencies to report the monthly amount of paper consumed each month, and the states then forwarded the reports, which also used a lot of paper. Finally, they ordered each state to forward to each local agency, requiring them to submit written reports on their plans to save paper and monthly reports on the progress of implementing their plans to save paper - which used a lot more paper out of thin air.</p>
<p>Ickes made another effort, ordering that official documents should be as brief as possible, and that matters that could be explained in four sentences should not be lengthened into four paragraphs filled with "etc." and other nonsense and boilerplate language. The purpose: still to save paper. But those bureaucrats came up with another trick. When writing four paragraphs of text, they used a large letterhead, and when writing four sentences, they also used such a large piece of paper, so paper was still not saved. Ickes was angry, and then ordered that typing should be as dense as possible, and that official documents that could be written on half a sheet of paper should only use letterhead of half the size. His subordinates also obeyed him with a smile - but when filing, they decided to "make it easier to check" and pasted all the documents written on half a sheet of paper on large sheets of paper before classifying them and putting them away. Not only did it waste paper, but it also wasted a lot of staff time!</p>
<p>The allure of success in imperial examinations, besides the priority of all public power and practical benefits, also held some ethereal, supportive, and lingering charm, captivating the hearts of young men at the time, often comparing the triumph in the examination hall to the blissful honeymoon of a marriage. Phrases like "The wedding night in the bridal chamber, the moment of being named on the golden list," and "Within books, there naturally lies a house of gold; within books, there naturally lies a jade-like beauty," are beautiful words full of illusion. Similarly, "Re-celebrating in the Qionglin Garden" and "Re-celebrating the Deer Cry Banquet" can be compared to "Re-experiencing the wedding night," with their rich and intense interest.</p>
<p>Celebrating a 60th wedding anniversary is not a common occurrence, hence it's called a "Diamond Wedding." Assuming the man and woman were married at the age of twenty, they both have to live to eighty. One person reaching eighty is already a rarity of old, let alone a couple of old people re-dressing and re-worshiping in the wedding hall. The "re-celebration" of success in imperial examinations is also like this. Old men in their eighties or nineties, wearing flowers and red sashes, raising their cups to congratulate new young scholars, is also a sign of youthful spirit in old age. Therefore, although the imperial examination system has been abolished for many years, old licentiates and old graduates still cannot forget about it. Precisely because it is hard-earned, the interest is even stronger.</p>
<p>For example, Xu Shichang (from Shuizhu Village) died of illness in Dalian two years after the outbreak of the Incident (1939), at the age of eighty-five. He was a licentiate of the Renwu year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. He would have had to wait until the age of eighty-eight in the 31st year of the Republic (1942) to reach the age for "re-celebrating the Deer Cry Banquet," which was three years short. He became a licentiate at the age of twenty-eight, which was not too late, and he lived to the age of eighty-five, which was not short, but he still didn't catch up with the second "jiazi" of the provincial examination. Old man Yu Quyuan caught up with re-taking the provincial examination, but didn't catch up with re-taking the metropolitan examination. Among recent people who have twice re-encountered both the provincial and metropolitan examinations, one was Chen Baochen (the teacher of Puyi) from Fujian, a licentiate of the Jiazi year and a graduate of the Wuchen year of the Tongzhi reign. He encountered the Jiazi year again in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), at the age of seventy-seven. He encountered the Wucheng year again in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), at the age of eighty-one. He passed away seven years later, in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). He possessed two excellent conditions: (1) particularly early success in imperial examinations (becoming a graduate at the age of twenty-one); (2) longevity (eighty-eight years old); so he was so unhurried. Another person was Zhang Yinglin, a licentiate of the Wuwu year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. He re-encountered the Wuwu year for the provincial examination in the 7th year of the Republic (1918); a graduate of the Yichou year of the Tongzhi reign, he re-encountered the Yichou year in the 14th year of the Republic (1925); but he soon passed away, also at the age of eighty-eight. Another person was Wu Yusheng from Suzhou, a licentiate of the Yihai year of the Guangxu reign (a classmate of Chen Sanli), at the age of twenty-two. He re-encountered the Yihai year in the 24th year of the Republic (1935); his graduate year was the Dingchou year, at the age of twenty-four, and he re-encountered the Dingchou year in the 26th year of the Republic (1937, the year of the July 7th Incident). He passed away in Qingdao four years later. He also possessed the two conditions of "early success in imperial examinations" and "longevity." (All three of the above entered the Hanlin Academy.)</p>
<p>Qu Hongji became a graduate and entered the Hanlin Academy at the age of twenty-two (Xinwei year of the Tongzhi reign). His success in imperial examinations came very early, but unfortunately, he only lived to the age of sixty-nine and passed away in Shanghai in the Wuwu year of the Republic (1919). (If he had lived to the Gengwu year of the Republic (1930), he would have re-encountered the provincial examination; in the Xinwei year (1931), he would have been able to re-encounter the metropolitan examination.) And as for Cai Yuanpei and Xiong Bingjian (Xiling), both were licentiates and graduates in their twenties, achieving success in their youth, but regrettably, their lifespans did not reach eighty years. (Both Cai and Xiong passed away in Hong Kong at the beginning of the Incident. Cai was just over seventy, and Xiong was not yet seventy.)</p>
<p>This year is the old lunar year of Wuzi. There are two people in Beiping who are old enough to re-encounter the provincial examination. One is Zhang Kang, who died of illness after being convicted and released for holding a puppet position. The other is Chuan Zengxiang, who has been chronically ill and half paralyzed. Therefore, there is not much celebration to be done.</p>
